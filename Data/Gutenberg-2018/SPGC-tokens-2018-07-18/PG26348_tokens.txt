preface
hans
aanrud
short
stories
are
considered
by
his
own
countrymen
as
belonging
to
the
most
original
and
artistically
finished
life
pictures
that
have
been
produced
by
the
younger
of
norway
they
are
generally
concerned
with
peasant
character
and
present
in
true
balance
the
coarse
and
fine
in
peasant
nature
the
style
of
speech
is
occasionally
for
sophisticated
ears
but
it
is
not
unwholesome
of
weak
or
cloying
sweetness
so
abhorrent
to
norwegian
taste
there
is
never
a
trace
was
dedicated
to
the
author
daughter
on
her
eighth
birthday
and
is
doubtless
largely
reminiscent
of
aanrud
own
childhood
if
i
have
been
able
to
give
a
rendering
at
all
worthy
of
the
original
readers
of
will
find
that
the
whole
story
breathes
a
spirit
of
unaffected
poetry
not
inconsistent
with
the
common
life
which
it
depicts
this
fine
blending
of
the
poetic
and
commonplace
is
another
characteristic
of
aanrud
writings
while
translating
the
book
i
was
living
in
the
region
where
the
scenes
of
the
story
are
laid
and
had
the
benefit
of
local
knowledge
concerning
terms
used
customs
referred
to
etc
no
pains
were
spared
in
verifying
particulars
especially
through
elderly
people
on
the
farms
who
could
best
explain
the
terms
and
who
had
a
clear
remembrance
of
obsolescent
details
of
sæter
life
for
this
welcome
help
and
for
elucidations
through
other
friends
i
wish
here
to
offer
my
hearty
thanks
being
desirous
of
having
the
conditions
of
norwegian
farm
life
made
as
clear
as
possible
to
young
english
and
american
readers
i
felt
that
several
illustrations
were
necessary
and
that
it
would
be
well
for
these
to
be
the
work
of
a
norwegian
to
understand
how
the
sun
can
be
already
high
in
the
heavens
when
it
rises
and
how
when
it
sets
the
shadow
of
the
western
mountain
can
creep
as
quickly
as
it
does
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
up
the
opposite
slope
one
must
have
some
conception
of
the
narrowness
of
norwegian
valleys
with
steep
mountain
ridges
on
either
side
i
felt
also
that
readers
would
be
interested
in
pictures
showing
how
the
dooryard
of
a
norwegian
farm
looks
how
the
open
fireplace
of
the
roomy
kitchen
differs
from
our
fireplaces
how
tall
and
slender
a
norwegian
stove
is
built
with
alternating
spaces
and
heat
boxes
several
stories
high
and
how
crookhorn
and
the
billy
goat
appeared
when
about
to
begin
their
grand
tussle
up
at
hoel
sæter
has
given
much
pleasure
to
old
and
young
i
hope
that
may
have
the
same
good
fortune

lisbeth

goes
to
hoel
farm
bearhunter
the
big
shaggy
old
dog
at
hoel
farm
sat
on
the
stone
step
in
front
of
the
house
looking
soberly
around
the
spacious
dooryard
it
was
a
clear
cold
winter
day
toward
the
beginning
of
spring
and
the
sun
shone
brightly
over
the
glittering
snow
in
spite
of
the
bright
sunshine
however
bearhunter
would
have
liked
to
be
indoors
much
better
than
out
if
his
sense
of
responsibility
had
permitted
for
his
paws
ached
with
the
cold
and
he
had
to
keep
holding
them
up
one
after
another
from
the
stone
slab
to
keep
from
getting
the
claw
ache
bearhunter
did
not
wish
to
risk
that
because
claw
ache
is
very
painful
as
every
northern
dog
knows
but
to
leave
his
post
as
watchman
was
not
to
be
thought
of
just
now
for
the
pigs
and
the
goats
were
out
at
this
moment
they
were
busy
with
their
separate
affairs
and
behaving
very
well
the
pigs
over
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
dooryard
scratching
themselves
against
the
corner
of
the
cow
house
and
the
goats
gnawing
bark
from
the
big
heap
of
pine
branches
that
had
been
laid
near
the
sheep
barn
for
their
special
use
they
looked
as
if
they
thought
of
nothing
but
their
scratching
and
gnawing
but
bearhunter
knew
well
from
previous
experience
that
no
sooner
would
he
go
into
the
house
than
both
pigs
and
goats
would
come
rushing
over
to
the
doorway
and
do
all
the
mischief
they
could
that
big
goat
crookhorn
the
new
one
who
had
come
to
the
farm
last
autumn
and
whom
bearhunter
had
not
yet
brought
under
discipline
had
already
strayed
in
a
roundabout
way
to
the
very
corner
of
the
farmhouse
and
was
looking
at
bearhunter
in
a
manner
as
if
she
did
not
fear
him
in
the
least
she
was
really
an
intolerable
creature
that
goat
crookhorn
but
just
let
her
dare
bearhunter
felt
that
he
must
sit
on
the
cold
doorstep
for
some
time
longer
at
any
rate
he
glanced
up
the
road
occasionally
as
if
to
see
whether
any
one
was
coming
so
that
the
pigs
and
goats
might
not
think
they
had
the
whole
of
his
attention
he
had
just
turned
his
head
leisurely
toward
the
narrow
road
that
came
down
crosswise
over
the
slope
from
the
upper
farms
when
what
in
the
world
was
that
something
coming
a
funny
little
something
what
a
pity
thought
bearhunter
that
his
sight
was
growing
so
poor
at
any
rate
he
had
better
give
the
people
in
the
house
warning
so
he
gave
several
deep
echoing
barks
the
goats
sprang
together
in
a
clump
and
raised
their
ears
the
pigs
stopped
in
the
very
midst
of
their
scratching
to
listen
that
bearhunter
was
held
in
great
respect
could
easily
be
seen
he
still
remained
sitting
on
the
doorstep
staring
up
the
road
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
such
a
thing
as
that
now
approaching
perhaps
after
all
it
was
nothing
worth
giving
warning
about
he
would
take
a
turn
up
the
road
and
look
at
it
a
little
nearer
so
arching
his
bushy
tail
into
a
handsome
curve
and
putting
on
his
most
expression
he
sauntered
off
yes
it
must
be
a
human
being
although
you
would
not
think
so
it
began
to
look
very
much
like
katrine
the
finn
as
they
called
her
who
came
to
the
farm
every
winter
but
it
could
not
be
katrine
it
was
altogether
too
little
it
wore
a
long
wide
skirt
and
from
under
the
skirt
protruded
the
tips
of
two
big
shoes
covered
with
gray
woolen
stocking
feet
from
which
the
legs
had
been
cut
off
above
the
skirt
there
was
a
round
bundle
of
clothes
with
a
knitted
shawl
tied
around
it
and
from
this
protruded
two
stumps
with
red
mittens
on
perched
on
the
top
of
all
was
a
smaller
shape
muffled
up
in
a
smaller
knitted
shawl
that
of
course
must
be
the
head
carried
at
the
back
was
a
huge
bundle
tied
up
in
a
dark
cloth
and
in
front
hung
a
pretty
wooden
pail
painted
red
really
bearhunter
had
to
stand
still
and
gaze
the
strange
figure
in
the
meantime
had
become
aware
of
him
and
it
also
came
to
a
standstill
as
if
in
a
dilemma
at
that
bearhunter
walked
over
to
the
farther
side
of
the
road
and
took
his
station
there
trying
to
look
indifferent
for
he
did
not
wish
to
cause
any
fright
the
strange
figure
then
made
its
way
carefully
forward
again
drawing
gradually
closer
and
closer
to
its
own
side
of
the
road
as
it
came
nearer
to
bearhunter
the
figure
turned
itself
around
by
degrees
until
when
directly
opposite
to
him
it
walked
along
quite
sidewise
then
it
was
that
bearhunter
got
a
peep
through
a
little
opening
in
the
upper
shawl
and
there
he
saw
the
tip
of
a
tiny
red
nose
then
a
red
mouth
that
was
drawn
down
a
little
at
the
corners
as
if
ready
for
crying
and
then
a
pair
of
big
blue
eyes
that
were
fastened
upon
him
with
a
look
of
terror
illustration
hoel
farm
pooh
it
was
nothing
after
all
but
a
little
girl
well
bundled
up
against
the
cold
bearhunter
did
not
know
her
but
wait
a
bit
he
thought
he
had
seen
that
pail
before
at
any
rate
it
would
be
absurd
to
try
to
frighten
this
queer
little
creature
his
tail
began
to
wag
involuntarily
as
he
walked
across
the
road
to
take
a
sniff
at
the
pail
the
little
girl
did
not
understand
his
action
at
once
stepping
back
in
alarm
she
caught
her
heels
in
her
long
frock
and
down
she
tumbled
by
the
side
of
the
road
bearhunter
darted
off
instantly
but
after
running
a
short
distance
toward
the
house
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
again
making
his
eyes
as
gentle
as
he
could
and
wagging
his
tail
energetically
with
bearhunter
that
wagging
of
the
tail
meant
hearty
laughter
then
the
little
girl
understood
she
got
up
smiled
and
jogged
slowly
after
him
bearhunter
trotted
leisurely
ahead
looking
back
at
her
from
time
to
time
he
knew
now
that
she
had
an
errand
at
hoel
farm
and
that
he
was
therefore
in
duty
bound
to
help
her
thus
it
was
that
lisbeth
longfrock
of
peerout
castle
made
her
entrance
into
hoel
farm
peerout
castle
was
perched
high
above
the
upper
farms
on
a
crag
that
jutted
out
from
a
barren
ridge
just
under
a
mountain
peak
called
the
big
hammer
the
real
name
of
the
little
farm
was
new
ridge
and
peerout
castle
was
only
a
nickname
given
to
it
by
a
joker
because
there
was
so
fine
an
outlook
from
it
and
because
it
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
to
a
castle
the
royal
lands
belonging
to
this
castle
consisted
of
a
little
plot
of
cultivated
soil
a
bit
of
meadow
land
here
and
there
and
some
heather
patches
where
tiny
blueberry
bushes
and
small
plants
grew
luxuriantly
the
outbuildings
were
a
shabby
cow
house
and
a
pigsty
the
cow
house
was
built
against
the
steep
hillside
with
three
walls
of
loosely
built
stone
and
its
two
stalls
were
dug
half
their
length
into
the
hill
the
tiny
pigsty
was
built
in
the
same
fashion
it
is
customary
in
norway
for
each
farm
however
small
to
have
a
name
as
for
the
castle
itself
that
was
a
very
very
small
cabin
lying
out
on
the
jutting
crag
in
the
middle
of
the
rocky
ridge
it
had
only
one
small
window
with
tiny
panes
of
glass
that
looked
out
over
the
valley
and
yet
in
whatever
part
of
the
surrounding
country
one
might
be
by
looking
in
that
direction
and
looking
high
enough
one
could
always
see
that
little
castle
with
its
single
window
peering
out
like
a
watchful
eye
over
the
landscape
since
the
castle
from
which
lisbeth
longfrock
came
was
no
more
magnificent
than
this
it
may
easily
be
understood
that
she
was
no
disguised
princess
but
only
a
poor
little
girl
coming
to
hoel
farm
for
the
first
time
was
for
her
like
visiting
an
estate
that
was
in
very
truth
royal
and
besides
she
had
come
on
an
important
errand
she
was
taking
her
mother
place
and
visiting
hoel
as
a
spinning
woman
lisbeth
mother
whose
name
was
randi
had
worked
hard
for
the
last
four
years
to
get
food
for
herself
and
her
children
up
at
peerout
castle
before
that
the
family
had
been
in
very
comfortable
circumstances
but
the
father
had
died
leaving
the
mother
with
the
castle
one
cow
and
the
care
of
the
two
children
the
children
were
jacob
at
that
time
about
six
years
old
and
lisbeth
a
couple
of
years
younger
life
was
often
a
hard
struggle
for
the
mother
but
they
had
at
any
rate
a
house
over
their
heads
and
they
could
get
wood
without
having
to
go
very
far
for
it
since
the
forest
lay
almost
within
a
stone
throw
in
the
original
roennaug
this
was
the
mother
first
name
her
full
name
would
be
randi
newridge
or
randi
peerout
in
the
summer
randi
managed
to
dig
up
her
tiny
plots
of
ground
after
a
fashion
so
that
she
could
harvest
a
few
potatoes
and
a
little
grain
by
cutting
grass
and
stripping
off
birch
leaves
she
had
thus
far
managed
each
year
to
give
bliros
their
cow
enough
to
eat
and
where
there
is
a
cow
there
is
always
food
in
the
winter
she
spun
linen
and
wool
for
the
women
on
the
farms
far
and
near
but
as
she
had
lived
at
hoel
farm
as
a
servant
before
she
was
married
it
was
natural
that
most
of
her
spinning
should
be
for
kjersti
hoel
in
such
ways
had
randi
been
able
to
care
for
her
family
meanwhile
jacob
now
ten
years
old
had
grown
big
enough
to
earn
his
own
living
in
the
spring
before
the
last
a
message
had
come
from
nordrum
farm
that
a
boy
was
needed
to
look
after
the
flocks
and
jacob
had
at
once
applied
and
been
accepted
he
and
lisbeth
had
often
knelt
on
the
long
wooden
bench
under
the
little
window
at
peerout
castle
and
gazed
upon
the
different
farms
choosing
which
they
would
work
on
when
they
were
big
enough
jacob
had
always
chosen
nordrum
farm
probably
because
he
had
heard
farmer
nordrum
spoken
of
as
the
big
man
of
the
community
while
lisbeth
had
always
thought
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
at
hoel
farm
because
it
was
owned
by
a
woman
when
autumn
came
farmer
nordrum
had
concluded
that
he
would
have
use
for
such
a
boy
as
jacob
during
the
winter
also
and
so
jacob
had
stayed
on
this
last
christmas
however
he
had
gone
home
for
the
whole
day
and
had
taken
with
him
a
christmas
present
for
his
sister
from
a
little
girl
at
nordrum
the
present
was
a
gray
woolen
frock
a
very
nice
one
jacob
had
grown
extremely
pleasant
and
full
of
fun
while
at
nordrum
lisbeth
thought
when
she
tried
the
frock
on
and
it
reached
way
down
to
the
ground
before
and
behind
he
called
her
lisbeth
longfrock
and
lisbeth
longfrock
she
had
remained
from
that
day
after
christmas
times
had
been
somewhat
harder
at
peerout
castle
bliros
who
generally
gave
milk
the
whole
year
round
had
become
dry
and
would
not
give
milk
for
several
months
she
was
to
have
a
calf
in
the
early
summer
during
the
last
few
weeks
there
had
not
been
milk
enough
even
for
randi
and
lisbeth
coffee
to
go
to
svehaugen
the
nearest
farm
for
milk
was
no
short
trip
and
milk
was
scarce
there
too
as
randi
well
knew
besides
she
could
not
spare
the
time
to
go
she
had
to
finish
spinning
kjersti
wool
when
she
once
got
that
off
her
hands
they
could
have
plenty
of
milk
for
their
coffee
and
other
good
things
besides
what
a
relief
it
would
be
when
that
time
came
so
randi
worked
steadily
at
her
spinning
lisbeth
being
now
big
enough
to
help
in
carding
the
wool
for
a
week
she
spun
almost
without
ceasing
scarcely
taking
time
for
meals
but
drinking
a
good
deal
of
strong
black
coffee
not
until
very
late
one
evening
was
kjersti
wool
all
spun
and
ready
by
that
time
randi
was
far
from
well
whether
or
not
her
illness
was
caused
as
she
thought
by
drinking
so
much
black
coffee
certain
it
is
that
when
kjersti
hoel
wool
was
all
spun
randi
felt
a
tightness
in
her
chest
and
when
she
got
up
the
next
morning
and
tried
to
get
ready
to
go
to
hoel
with
the
spinning
she
was
seized
with
such
a
sudden
dizziness
that
she
had
to
go
back
to
bed
again
she
was
too
weak
for
anything
else
now
it
was
the
custom
in
norway
for
the
spinning
woman
to
take
back
to
the
different
farms
the
wool
she
had
spun
and
for
the
farmers
wives
to
praise
her
work
treat
her
to
something
good
to
eat
and
drink
pay
her
and
then
give
her
directions
about
the
way
the
next
spinning
was
to
be
done
all
this
randi
would
have
to
give
up
for
the
present
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
she
wondered
how
it
would
do
to
send
lisbeth
to
hoel
farm
in
her
stead
the
little
girl
would
find
her
way
safely
randi
was
sure
although
randi
had
never
as
yet
taken
her
to
that
farm
because
it
was
so
far
off
the
payment
for
the
spinning
was
to
be
in
eatables
as
well
as
money
and
lisbeth
could
bring
home
part
of
what
was
due
then
though
they
still
might
lack
many
things
their
drop
of
coffee
could
have
cream
in
it
as
coffee
ought
to
have
the
remainder
of
the
payment
and
the
directions
for
the
next
spinning
randi
herself
could
get
when
she
was
better
if
she
could
only
be
sure
that
lisbeth
would
behave
properly
and
not
act
like
a
changeling
a
troll
child
lisbeth
eagerly
promised
that
if
her
mother
would
allow
her
to
go
she
would
behave
exactly
as
a
spinning
woman
should
she
would
really
and
she
remembered
perfectly
well
just
how
everything
was
done
that
time
she
had
gone
with
her
mother
to
one
of
the
nearer
farms
so
lisbeth
put
on
her
long
frock
which
was
used
only
for
very
best
and
her
mother
wrapped
her
up
snugly
in
the
two
shawls
then
the
bundle
of
yarn
was
slung
over
her
back
the
pail
was
hung
in
front
many
directions
were
given
to
her
about
the
road
and
off
she
started
and
that
is
the
way
lisbeth
longfrock
happened
to
come
toddling
after
bearhunter
to
hoel
farm
on
that
clear
cold
winter
day
toward
the
beginning
of
spring
chapter
ii
lisbeth
longfrock
as
spinning
woman
when
lisbeth
found
herself
in
the
farm
dooryard
with
the
different
buildings
all
about
her
she
really
had
to
stand
still
and
gaze
around
oh
how
large
everything
was
quite
on
another
scale
from
things
at
home
why
the
barn
door
was
so
broad
and
high
that
peerout
castle
could
easily
go
right
through
it
and
each
windowpane
in
the
big
house
was
as
large
as
their
own
whole
window
and
such
a
goat
for
just
then
she
caught
sight
of
crookhorn
who
had
come
warily
up
to
the
doorway
and
who
only
saw
fit
to
draw
back
as
bearhunter
approached
not
that
crookhorn
was
afraid
of
bearhunter
no
indeed
the
goat
was
larger
than
most
goats
about
as
large
as
a
calf
if
the
cows
belonging
to
hoel
farm
were
as
much
larger
than
ordinary
cows
thought
lisbeth
they
would
be
able
to
eat
grass
from
the
roof
of
peerout
castle
while
standing
just
as
usual
on
the
ground
she
glanced
searchingly
at
the
door
no
it
was
not
larger
than
such
doors
usually
were
so
the
cows
were
evidently
no
bigger
than
other
cows
norwegian
children
in
country
districts
are
accustomed
to
see
goats
walking
about
on
the
roofs
of
huts
nibbling
the
herbage
but
the
idea
of
a
creature
so
large
as
to
be
able
to
eat
from
the
roof
while
standing
on
the
ground
was
very
astonishing
to
lisbeth
bearhunter
had
followed
after
crookhorn
until
the
latter
was
well
out
of
the
way
then
he
had
come
back
again
and
now
stood
wagging
his
tail
and
turning
toward
the
house
door
as
if
coaxing
lisbeth
to
go
in
yes
she
must
attend
to
her
errand
and
not
stay
out
there
staring
at
everything
so
she
followed
after
bearhunter
and
went
into
the
hall
way
she
lifted
the
latch
of
the
inner
door
turned
herself
around
carefully
as
she
went
in
so
as
to
make
room
for
her
bundle
fastened
the
door
behind
her
and
there
she
stood
inside
the
big
kitchen
at
hoel
illustration
the
big
kitchen
at
hoel
farm
there
were
only
two
people
in
the
kitchen
one
a
young
servant
maid
in
the
middle
of
the
room
spinning
and
the
other
the
mistress
herself
kjersti
hoel
over
by
the
white
wall
of
the
big
open
fireplace
grinding
coffee
both
looked
up
when
they
heard
the
door
open
lisbeth
longfrock
stood
still
for
a
moment
then
made
a
deep
courtesy
under
her
long
frock
and
said
in
a
way
just
as
she
had
heard
her
mother
say
good
day
and
god
bless
your
work
kjersti
hoel
had
to
smile
when
she
saw
the
little
bundle
over
by
the
door
talking
in
such
a
fashion
but
she
answered
as
soberly
as
if
she
also
were
talking
to
a
person
good
day
is
this
a
young
stranger
out
for
a
walk
yes
and
what
is
the
stranger
name
and
where
is
she
from
i
see
that
i
do
not
know
her
no
you
could
not
be
expected
to
my
mother
and
jacob
call
me
lisbeth
longfrock
and
i
am
from
peerout
castle
mother
sent
me
here
with
the
woolen
yarn
she
has
spun
for
you
she
told
me
to
say
that
she
could
not
come
with
it
before
for
she
did
not
get
the
last
spool
wound
until
late
last
night
indeed
can
it
be
a
spinning
woman
we
have
here
and
to
think
that
i
wholly
forgot
to
ask
you
to
sit
down
after
your
long
walk
you
really
must
take
off
your
things
and
stay
awhile
what
a
pleasant
woman
kjersti
hoel
was
she
got
up
from
her
own
chair
and
set
one
forward
for
lisbeth
thank
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
sit
down
said
lisbeth
she
took
off
the
pail
and
the
bundle
of
wool
and
put
them
down
by
the
door
and
then
began
to
walk
across
the
floor
over
to
the
chair
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
never
get
there
so
far
was
it
across
the
big
kitchen
nearly
as
far
as
from
their
own
door
to
the
door
at
peerout
castle
at
last
however
she
reached
the
chair
but
it
was
higher
than
the
seats
she
was
accustomed
to
and
she
could
barely
scramble
up
on
one
corner
of
it
kjersti
hoel
came
toward
her
i
really
think
i
must
open
this
bundle
and
see
what
is
in
it
said
she
and
she
began
to
take
off
lisbeth
red
mittens
and
to
undo
the
knitted
shawls
soon
lisbeth
sat
there
stripped
of
all
her
outer
toggery
but
nevertheless
looking
almost
as
plump
and
as
ever
for
not
only
did
her
long
frock
barely
clear
the
ground
at
the
bottom
but
its
band
reached
almost
up
under
her
arms
kjersti
stood
and
looked
at
her
a
moment
that
is
just
what
i
thought
that
i
should
find
a
nice
little
girl
inside
all
those
clothes
you
look
like
your
mother
at
this
lisbeth
grew
so
shy
that
she
forgot
all
about
being
a
spinning
woman
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
could
not
say
a
word
but
what
is
the
matter
with
randi
your
mother
continued
kjersti
why
could
she
not
come
herself
she
was
a
little
poorly
indeed
randi
not
well
and
her
health
is
generally
so
good
what
ails
her
oh
she
thought
that
very
likely
drinking
strong
coffee
without
milk
had
not
been
good
for
her
so
you
have
no
milk
at
your
house
perhaps
that
is
why
you
have
brought
a
pail
with
you
yes
what
do
you
think
bliros
has
stopped
giving
us
milk
this
winter
has
she
indeed
that
is
rather
inconvenient
is
it
how
long
before
she
can
be
milked
again
not
until
the
beginning
of
summer
after
she
has
had
her
calf
h
said
kjersti
thoughtfully
by
and
by
as
if
to
herself
she
said
i
have
often
thought
of
going
to
see
randi
but
have
never
done
so
before
this
spring
is
over
i
must
surely
pay
her
a
visit
lisbeth
longfrock
stayed
a
long
time
at
hoel
that
day
although
she
had
come
in
the
important
character
of
spinning
woman
she
had
never
imagined
that
a
great
person
like
kjersti
hoel
would
be
so
pleasant
and
kind
to
her
kjersti
treated
her
to
coffee
and
cakes
and
milk
and
other
good
things
just
as
if
she
had
been
an
invited
guest
and
chatted
with
her
in
such
a
way
that
lisbeth
forgot
all
about
being
shy
and
oh
how
many
curious
things
kjersti
showed
her
the
cow
house
was
the
finest
of
them
all
there
were
so
many
cows
that
lisbeth
could
scarcely
count
them
and
then
the
pigs
and
sheep
and
goats
and
hens
too
inside
a
big
latticework
inclosure
nearly
as
many
of
them
as
there
were
crows
in
autumn
up
at
peerout
and
kjersti
wanted
to
know
about
whether
lisbeth
could
read
and
write
she
could
do
both
for
jacob
had
taught
her
and
how
they
managed
about
food
up
at
peerout
castle
and
how
it
went
with
the
farming
lisbeth
could
tell
her
that
in
the
autumn
they
had
gathered
three
barrels
of
potatoes
and
one
barrel
and
three
pecks
of
mixed
grain
and
that
they
had
stripped
off
so
many
birch
leaves
that
they
had
fodder
enough
to
carry
bliros
through
the
winter
in
fact
much
more
than
enough
when
kjersti
had
shown
lisbeth
the
sheep
and
the
goats
she
declared
that
she
should
certainly
need
a
little
girl
to
look
after
her
flocks
when
spring
came
and
then
lisbeth
before
she
knew
what
she
was
saying
told
kjersti
how
she
and
jacob
used
to
look
at
the
farms
from
the
window
at
home
and
how
she
had
always
chosen
hoel
as
the
place
where
she
should
like
to
work
when
she
was
big
enough
should
you
really
like
to
go
out
to
work
kjersti
inquired
yes
indeed
lisbeth
said
if
it
were
not
for
leaving
mother
well
we
will
not
think
about
that
any
more
at
present
said
kjersti
but
i
will
go
up
and
talk
with
your
mother
about
it
some
time
in
the
spring
we
certainly
ought
to
go
into
the
house
now
so
that
you
can
have
time
to
take
a
little
food
before
leaving
it
is
drawing
toward
evening
and
you
will
have
to
start
for
home
soon
so
they
went
into
the
house
again
and
lisbeth
had
another
feast
of
good
things
while
she
was
eating
she
noticed
that
kjersti
brought
from
the
cellar
some
butter
and
cheese
and
other
things
and
packed
them
in
the
dark
cloth
in
which
the
wool
had
been
tied
the
milk
pail
she
did
not
touch
at
all
but
lisbeth
saw
that
she
said
something
about
it
softly
to
the
servant
maid
after
which
the
maid
left
the
room
when
lisbeth
had
eaten
and
had
said
thanks
and
praise
for
both
food
and
drink
kjersti
remarked
now
you
must
lift
the
bundle
over
there
and
see
if
you
can
carry
it
the
bundle
rather
heavy
still
lisbeth
thought
she
could
manage
it
but
the
pail
not
a
word
did
kjersti
say
even
now
about
the
pail
she
only
added
kindly
come
and
i
will
help
you
put
on
your
things
she
drew
on
lisbeth
mittens
wrapped
her
up
snugly
in
the
two
little
shawls
and
in
a
trice
there
stood
lisbeth
longfrock
looking
exactly
as
she
did
when
she
had
come
to
hoel
that
morning
slowly
and
reluctantly
lisbeth
went
toward
the
door
where
the
pail
still
stood
how
strange
that
kjersti
had
not
even
yet
said
a
single
word
about
it
lisbeth
stood
for
a
moment
in
doubt
after
receiving
so
much
it
would
never
do
to
remind
kjersti
about
the
pail
but
she
would
much
rather
have
gone
without
the
good
things
she
herself
had
been
treated
to
than
to
go
home
without
any
milk
for
her
mother
coffee
she
took
up
the
bundle
drew
her
face
with
its
nose
tip
back
into
its
little
shawl
as
far
as
she
could
so
that
kjersti
should
not
see
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
then
bent
down
and
lifted
the
pail
at
that
kjersti
said
oh
yes
the
pail
i
quite
forgot
it
are
you
willing
to
exchange
pails
with
me
if
i
give
you
one
that
will
never
get
empty
lisbeth
dropped
her
pail
plump
on
the
floor
she
had
seen
and
heard
many
curious
things
on
this
eventful
day
things
she
had
never
seen
or
thought
of
before
but
that
kjersti
besides
everything
else
had
a
pail
that
would
never
get
empty
she
stood
and
stared
yes
you
must
come
and
see
it
said
kjersti
it
stands
just
outside
the
door
lisbeth
was
not
slow
in
making
her
way
out
kjersti
followed
her
there
stood
the
servant
maid
holding
the
big
goat
crookhorn
by
a
rope
the
goat
is
used
to
being
led
said
kjersti
so
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
taking
it
home
give
my
greetings
to
your
mother
and
ask
her
if
she
is
satisfied
with
the
exchange
of
pails
kjersti
was
not
a
bit
displeased
because
lisbeth
longfrock
forgot
to
express
her
thanks
as
she
started
off
with
crookhorn
bearhunter
followed
the
little
girl
and
the
goat
a
long
distance
up
the
road
he
did
not
understand
matters
at
all
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
randi
too
was
greatly
surprised
when
she
saw
crookhorn
following
after
lisbeth
as
the
little
girl
approached
the
castle
there
was
not
time
for
lisbeth
to
tell
about
everything
at
the
very
first
for
her
mother
and
she
had
to
clear
up
the
stall
next
to
the
one
bliros
occupied
and
put
crookhorn
into
it
when
this
was
done
they
felt
exactly
as
if
they
had
two
cows
the
goat
took
her
place
in
the
stall
with
a
superior
air
quite
as
if
she
were
a
real
cow
and
had
never
done
anything
else
but
stand
in
a
cow
stall
bliros
became
offended
at
this
remarkable
newcomer
who
was
putting
on
such
airs
in
the
cow
house
that
had
always
belonged
to
herself
alone
and
so
she
made
a
lunge
with
her
head
and
tried
to
hook
the
goat
with
her
horns
but
crookhorn
merely
turned
her
own
horns
against
those
of
bliros
in
the
most
indifferent
manner
as
if
quite
accustomed
to
being
hooked
by
cows
bliros
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
such
a
silly
goat
she
had
never
seen
such
a
silly
goat
and
with
that
she
turned
her
head
to
the
wall
again
and
did
not
give
crookhorn
another
look
that
evening
lisbeth
longfrock
had
so
many
things
to
tell
her
mother
that
she
talked
herself
fast
asleep
chapter
iii
leaving
peerout
castle
the
next
time
lisbeth
longfrock
came
to
hoel
farm
she
did
not
come
alone
and
she
came
to
stay
all
that
had
happened
between
that
first
visit
and
her
second
coming
had
been
far
far
different
from
anything
lisbeth
had
ever
imagined
it
seemed
as
if
there
had
been
no
time
for
her
to
think
about
the
strange
events
while
they
were
taking
place
she
did
not
realize
what
their
result
would
be
until
after
she
had
lived
through
them
and
gone
out
of
the
gate
of
peerout
castle
when
everything
was
over
so
much
had
been
going
on
in
those
last
sad
solemn
days
so
much
that
was
new
to
see
and
to
hear
that
although
she
had
felt
a
lump
in
her
throat
the
whole
time
she
had
not
had
a
real
cry
until
at
the
very
end
but
when
she
had
passed
through
the
gate
that
last
day
and
had
stopped
and
looked
back
the
picture
that
she
then
saw
had
brought
the
whole
clearly
before
her
with
all
its
sorrow
something
was
gone
that
would
never
come
again
she
would
never
again
go
to
peerout
castle
except
as
a
stranger
she
had
no
home
no
home
anywhere
and
at
that
she
had
begun
to
weep
so
bitterly
that
those
who
had
been
thinking
how
wisely
and
quietly
she
was
taking
her
trouble
could
but
stand
and
look
at
her
in
wonder
the
last
two
months
of
the
winter
had
passed
so
quickly
up
at
peerout
castle
that
lisbeth
really
could
not
tell
what
had
become
of
them
and
this
was
owing
not
a
little
to
the
fact
that
besides
all
her
other
work
she
had
so
much
to
do
in
the
cow
house
crookhorn
had
become
as
it
were
lisbeth
cow
and
consequently
had
to
be
taken
care
of
by
her
bliros
showed
very
plainly
that
she
would
not
like
at
all
to
have
randi
attentions
bestowed
upon
a
rascally
goat
that
would
make
it
seem
as
if
the
goat
were
fully
as
important
a
person
in
the
cow
house
as
bliros
herself
whereas
the
whole
cow
house
in
reality
belonged
to
her
and
that
other
creature
was
only
allowed
there
as
a
favor
so
lisbeth
took
care
of
crookhorn
exactly
as
she
saw
her
mother
take
care
of
bliros
in
fact
before
long
she
had
more
to
do
in
the
cow
house
than
her
mother
had
for
she
soon
learned
to
milk
crookhorn
while
bliros
her
mother
cow
could
not
then
be
milked
and
crookhorn
gave
so
much
milk
three
times
a
day
lisbeth
had
to
milk
her
there
was
no
longer
any
scarcity
of
cream
for
coffee
or
milk
for
porridge
indeed
there
was
even
cream
enough
to
make
waffles
with
now
and
then
springtime
came
it
always
came
early
up
at
peerout
castle
the
slopes
of
heather
directly
facing
the
sun
were
the
first
in
the
whole
valley
to
peep
up
out
of
the
snow
as
soon
as
the
heathery
spots
began
to
show
themselves
lisbeth
was
out
on
them
stepping
here
and
there
with
a
cautious
foot
it
seemed
so
wonderful
to
step
on
bare
earth
again
instead
of
snow
day
by
day
she
kept
track
of
the
different
green
patches
watching
them
grow
larger
and
larger
and
seeing
how
the
snow
glided
slowly
farther
and
farther
downward
exactly
as
her
own
frock
did
when
she
loosened
the
band
and
let
it
slip
down
and
lie
in
a
ring
around
her
feet
when
the
snow
had
slipped
as
far
down
as
the
big
stone
where
she
and
jacob
used
to
have
their
cow
house
using
pine
cones
for
cows
and
sheep
the
outermost
buds
on
the
trees
would
swell
and
be
ready
to
burst
she
knew
that
from
the
year
before
and
when
the
buds
had
really
opened
she
kept
close
watch
of
them
every
day
now
then
would
come
the
great
day
when
crookhorn
could
be
let
out
lisbeth
mother
had
said
so
that
great
day
was
what
she
was
waiting
for
not
only
because
it
would
be
so
pleasant
for
crookhorn
to
be
out
but
because
no
food
was
equal
to
the
first
buds
of
spring
for
making
goats
yield
rich
milk
lisbeth
mother
had
been
far
from
well
ever
since
the
day
that
lisbeth
went
over
to
hoel
farm
for
the
first
time
but
lisbeth
thought
that
as
soon
as
crookhorn
had
fresh
buds
to
eat
and
gave
richer
milk
her
mother
would
of
course
get
entirely
well
it
is
very
possible
that
a
little
streak
of
snow
was
still
lying
by
the
upper
side
of
the
big
stone
in
spite
of
lisbeth
having
scattered
sand
there
to
make
the
snow
melt
faster
on
the
bright
spring
day
when
lisbeth
went
into
the
cow
house
unfastened
crookhorn
and
led
her
out
of
the
stall
as
for
crookhorn
she
followed
her
little
mistress
very
sedately
until
they
reached
the
door
there
she
stopped
short
looking
around
and
blinking
at
the
sun
lisbeth
pulled
at
the
rope
trying
to
drag
her
over
to
the
part
of
the
ridge
where
the
birch
tree
with
the
fullest
leaf
buds
stood
but
crookhorn
would
not
budge
she
merely
stood
as
if
nothing
were
being
done
to
her
for
she
was
so
strong
that
however
hard
lisbeth
pulled
it
did
not
even
make
her
stretch
her
neck
lisbeth
then
went
nearer
thinking
that
she
could
pull
better
without
such
a
length
of
rope
between
her
and
the
goat
but
at
that
quick
as
a
wink
crookhorn
lowered
her
head
and
butted
lisbeth
causing
the
little
girl
to
fall
back
against
the
hillside
with
a
whack
upon
which
crookhorn
stalked
in
an
indifferent
manner
across
the
road
lisbeth
picked
herself
up
and
started
to
go
after
her
charge
but
if
you
please
as
soon
as
she
came
near
enough
and
tried
to
seize
crookhorn
away
would
that
naughty
goat
dart
not
galloping
as
a
goat
usually
does
but
trotting
like
a
cow
or
an
elk
she
trotted
by
the
house
and
turned
off
on
the
road
leading
to
svehaugen
farm
lisbeth
pursued
swiftly
but
run
as
she
might
she
could
not
gain
upon
crookhorn
at
last
stumbling
over
a
stone
the
little
girl
fell
at
full
length
having
barely
time
while
falling
to
look
up
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
crookhorn
back
as
the
goat
trotting
swiftly
disappeared
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
there
was
no
other
way
out
of
it
lisbeth
would
have
to
run
home
and
get
her
mother
to
help
her
this
she
did
and
they
both
set
out
in
full
chase
it
was
a
long
run
for
they
did
not
overtake
crookhorn
until
they
had
reached
the
svehaugen
gate
there
stood
the
goat
gazing
unconcernedly
through
the
palings
she
evidently
felt
herself
superior
to
jumping
over
fences
she
who
imagined
herself
to
be
a
cow
randi
had
become
much
overheated
from
running
and
at
night
when
she
went
to
bed
she
said
she
felt
cold
and
shivery
that
seemed
very
strange
indeed
to
lisbeth
for
when
she
laid
her
face
against
her
mother
neck
it
was
as
hot
as
a
burning
coal
in
the
morning
lisbeth
mother
woke
her
and
told
her
to
get
up
and
go
over
to
kari
svehaugen
and
ask
kari
to
come
to
peerout
castle
randi
felt
so
poorly
that
there
was
no
use
in
her
even
trying
to
get
up
she
was
not
able
not
able
to
get
up
that
also
seemed
very
strange
to
lisbeth
for
never
before
had
she
seen
her
mother
with
cheeks
so
red
and
eyes
so
shining
the
child
did
not
say
anything
however
but
got
up
dressed
herself
quickly
and
quietly
and
ran
off
to
svehaugen
after
that
there
came
several
wonderful
days
at
peerout
castle
when
lisbeth
longfrock
thought
about
them
afterward
they
seemed
like
a
single
long
day
in
which
a
great
many
things
had
happened
that
she
could
not
separate
from
one
another
and
set
in
order
in
her
remembrance
it
was
as
if
shadows
had
glided
to
and
fro
in
an
ugly
yellow
light
while
the
sound
of
a
heavy
painful
breathing
was
constantly
heard
penetrating
all
other
sounds
she
seemed
dimly
to
see
kari
svehaugen
gliding
about
and
taking
care
of
things
in
the
home
and
out
in
the
cow
house
she
herself
had
climbed
a
birch
tree
several
times
and
picked
leaf
buds
for
the
animals
to
eat
one
day
lars
svehaugen
had
flitted
along
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
swiftly
as
if
he
had
not
a
moment
to
spare
soon
after
this
some
one
dressed
in
furs
and
with
big
boots
on
came
driving
to
the
house
and
all
the
neighbors
flocked
around
him
listening
to
what
he
said
and
he
brought
such
a
curious
smell
with
him
it
filled
the
whole
house
so
that
even
after
he
had
gone
away
he
seemed
to
be
still
there
she
thought
too
that
once
she
had
seen
kjersti
hoel
sitting
on
a
chair
taking
many
good
things
out
of
a
big
basket
and
jacob
standing
by
kjersti
side
with
a
great
slice
of
raisin
cake
in
his
hand
and
jacob
had
kept
chewing
and
chewing
on
his
raisin
cake
as
if
it
was
hard
work
to
get
it
down
what
she
remembered
chiefly
though
was
jacob
eyes
they
looked
so
big
and
strange
then
one
morning
she
had
awakened
in
a
clear
gray
light
and
from
that
time
she
remembered
everything
very
distinctly
she
was
lying
in
the
little
that
jacob
had
slept
in
when
he
lived
at
home
she
must
of
course
have
slept
in
it
all
these
nights
and
kari
svehaugen
was
standing
beside
it
looking
down
upon
her
the
house
was
oh
so
still
she
did
not
hear
the
heavy
painful
breathing
any
longer
the
only
sound
was
a
slight
crackling
in
the
fireplace
out
of
which
a
stream
of
warmth
issued
kari
said
very
quietly
your
mother
is
comfortable
and
happy
now
little
lisbeth
better
off
than
she
has
ever
been
before
so
you
must
not
cry
and
lisbeth
did
not
cry
she
merely
got
up
and
went
about
the
house
very
very
quietly
all
that
first
day
afterwards
there
were
so
many
preparations
being
made
for
some
solemn
festival
that
she
did
not
seem
to
get
time
to
think
about
the
great
change
that
had
taken
place
lars
svehaugen
came
from
the
storekeeper
with
ever
so
much
fine
white
shining
cloth
she
had
never
seen
the
like
then
a
woman
came
to
help
kari
cut
out
and
sew
and
they
made
pillows
and
a
fine
white
garment
that
mother
was
to
have
on
when
she
lay
upon
the
pillows
and
lars
svehaugen
began
to
make
a
new
wooden
bed
for
mother
to
lie
in
and
bliros
had
her
calf
and
the
calf
was
slaughtered
and
lars
svehaugen
brought
some
small
pine
trees
and
nailed
them
at
the
gateposts
and
outside
the
house
door
one
at
each
side
and
he
strewed
pine
branches
all
the
way
from
the
door
to
the
gate
and
there
came
presents
of
food
oh
so
many
good
things
from
kjersti
hoel
and
others
lisbeth
had
never
tasted
such
delicious
food
before
then
came
the
day
when
mother
was
to
be
taken
to
the
church
and
buried
many
people
came
to
the
house
that
day
among
them
jacob
in
a
bright
new
suit
of
gray
woolen
homespun
and
there
was
a
feast
for
them
all
and
everything
was
very
still
and
solemn
even
the
schoolmaster
came
and
oh
how
beautifully
he
sang
when
lars
svehaugen
and
three
other
men
carried
mother
out
through
the
door
and
set
her
couch
upon
a
sledge
then
they
all
went
slowly
away
from
the
house
down
the
hill
the
sledge
first
and
the
people
walking
slowly
behind
but
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
in
the
road
there
stood
two
horses
and
wagons
waiting
and
just
think
lisbeth
and
jacob
were
invited
to
sit
up
in
kjersti
hoel
broad
wagon
and
drive
with
her
then
they
came
to
the
white
church
and
as
they
carried
mother
in
through
the
big
gateway
the
church
bells
up
in
the
tower
rang
oh
so
beautifully
after
that
lisbeth
did
not
see
things
quite
so
clearly
but
they
lowered
mother
down
into
the
earth
in
the
churchyard
and
strewed
wreaths
of
green
heather
over
her
and
then
the
schoolmaster
sang
again
and
all
the
men
took
off
their
hats
and
held
them
a
long
time
before
their
faces
after
that
the
people
went
out
of
the
churchyard
and
lisbeth
and
jacob
climbed
into
kjersti
hoel
broad
wagon
again
and
drove
away
only
this
time
they
drove
much
faster
it
looked
as
if
the
boards
in
the
fences
ran
after
each
other
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
one
in
which
she
and
jacob
were
going
they
both
tried
to
count
them
but
could
not
all
the
people
came
back
with
them
to
peerout
castle
kjersti
hoel
too
kari
svehaugen
who
had
not
gone
to
the
church
had
covered
the
table
with
a
white
tablecloth
and
set
it
with
plates
and
good
things
to
eat
and
all
the
people
ate
and
talked
but
they
did
not
talk
very
loudly
when
the
meal
was
over
lisbeth
got
jacob
to
go
out
into
the
cow
house
to
look
at
crookhorn
jacob
conceded
that
the
goat
was
an
extremely
fine
animal
but
she
was
a
vixen
he
was
sure
he
could
tell
that
by
her
eyelids
then
they
went
over
to
the
hill
to
look
at
the
mill
wheel
that
jacob
used
to
have
there
but
it
had
fallen
into
complete
decay
because
he
had
been
away
from
home
so
long
such
things
need
a
boy
personal
attention
after
that
they
were
called
into
the
house
again
and
everybody
drank
coffee
when
they
had
finished
the
coffee
drinking
kari
began
packing
into
baskets
the
food
that
was
left
and
when
that
was
done
kjersti
hoel
said
well
now
we
have
done
everything
that
we
can
here
you
may
bring
crookhorn
with
you
lisbeth
and
come
to
live
with
me
that
was
the
last
thing
i
promised
your
mother
thus
had
it
come
about
that
lisbeth
longfrock
holding
crookhorn
by
a
rope
stood
outside
the
gate
at
peerout
castle
with
kjersti
hoel
and
bearhunter
and
then
it
was
that
she
looked
behind
her
and
began
to
cry
on
one
road
she
saw
kari
svehaugen
with
a
big
basket
on
her
arm
and
bliros
following
her
and
on
the
other
she
saw
the
back
of
jacob
with
whom
she
had
just
shaken
hands
saying
may
you
fare
well
he
looked
singularly
small
and
forlorn
last
of
all
she
saw
lars
svehaugen
put
a
pine
twig
in
the
door
latch
as
a
sign
that
peerout
castle
was
now
closed
locked
and
forsaken
chapter
iv
spring
letting
the
animals
out
to
pasture
one
morning
a
few
weeks
after
the
sad
departure
from
peerout
castle
lisbeth
longfrock
awoke
early
in
the
small
sleeping
room
built
under
the
great
staircase
at
hoel
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
at
the
moment
of
waking
and
tried
to
gather
her
thoughts
together
she
was
conscious
of
a
delightful
quivering
expectancy
and
felt
that
she
had
awakened
to
something
great
and
new
something
that
she
had
waited
for
and
been
exceedingly
glad
over
but
she
could
not
at
once
remember
just
what
it
was
the
little
room
whose
only
furniture
consisted
of
a
bed
a
chair
a
stove
and
a
small
wooden
shelf
with
a
mirror
over
it
was
filled
with
daylight
in
spite
of
the
early
hour
the
sun
fell
slanting
down
through
a
window
set
high
up
in
the
wall
directly
over
lisbeth
bed
and
the
windowpanes
were
pictured
in
bright
yellow
squares
on
the
floor
near
the
tiny
stove
the
corner
of
one
square
spread
itself
against
the
stove
and
lisbeth
traced
it
with
her
eyes
as
she
lay
in
bed
at
the
tip
of
the
corner
glimmered
something
and
shiny
was
it
from
there
that
a
fine
wonderful
fragrance
came
floating
toward
her
she
sniffed
a
little
yes
indeed
now
she
remembered
the
fragrance
came
from
the
fresh
birch
twigs
she
had
decorated
the
room
with
yesterday
out
of
doors
it
was
spring
the
sprouting
bursting
springtime
the
cattle
were
to
be
let
out
and
the
calves
named
she
would
begin
work
in
earnest
and
be
a
responsible
individual
in
short
she
would
be
the
herd
girl
at
hoel
farm
it
was
now
a
month
since
lisbeth
had
come
to
hoel
farm
but
up
to
this
time
she
had
been
treated
merely
as
company
she
had
walked
about
the
place
sauntered
after
kjersti
here
and
there
in
the
house
ground
the
coffee
and
brought
out
from
a
bowl
in
the
pantry
the
small
cakes
that
they
ate
with
their
coffee
every
afternoon
frequently
too
she
had
had
pleasant
talks
with
kjersti
as
for
helping
with
the
animals
the
sheep
and
the
goats
had
been
let
out
to
be
sure
but
nevertheless
they
did
not
need
her
care
because
they
were
allowed
so
early
in
the
season
to
run
about
everywhere
except
in
the
garden
and
that
bearhunter
stood
guard
over
in
the
cow
house
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
for
a
milkmaid
and
an
did
the
work
there
of
course
the
girl
who
tended
the
flocks
ought
really
to
be
able
to
help
in
milking
the
cows
but
it
was
thought
that
lisbeth
had
better
wait
a
year
before
she
tried
to
do
that
her
hands
being
rather
too
small
as
yet
lisbeth
had
kept
measuring
her
hands
every
now
and
then
and
pulling
her
fingers
to
make
them
grow
and
after
a
while
she
had
asked
the
milkmaid
if
she
did
not
think
they
had
grown
large
enough
but
the
milkmaid
did
not
see
that
they
were
any
larger
she
could
not
have
very
good
eyes
lisbeth
had
of
course
expected
to
take
care
of
crookhorn
kjersti
and
she
both
thought
she
ought
to
do
that
but
it
had
proved
to
be
impossible
crookhorn
had
become
so
freakish
that
sometimes
they
almost
thought
her
out
of
her
wits
in
the
building
shared
by
the
sheep
and
goats
she
ranged
back
and
forth
from
wall
to
wall
knocking
against
the
sheep
and
the
other
goats
so
hard
as
she
went
that
their
ribs
rattled
at
last
she
had
to
be
tied
to
one
of
the
walls
and
with
the
shortest
rope
possible
at
that
nor
would
she
allow
herself
to
be
milked
peaceably
in
that
building
the
first
time
lisbeth
tried
it
crookhorn
with
a
toss
of
the
head
gave
a
kick
that
sent
lisbeth
and
the
pail
rolling
off
in
different
directions
afterward
the
milkmaid
herself
took
crookhorn
in
hand
at
milking
time
but
even
for
her
it
was
always
a
feat
of
strength
and
she
had
to
have
some
one
to
help
her
by
holding
the
goat
horns
when
crookhorn
was
let
out
with
the
other
goats
would
she
ramble
with
them
over
the
fields
and
meadows
seeking
food
no
indeed
she
would
station
herself
poutingly
by
the
door
and
stand
there
the
livelong
day
bellowing
like
a
cow
the
farm
boy
said
and
then
in
the
evening
when
the
other
goats
came
home
plump
and
well
fed
there
crookhorn
would
stand
as
thin
and
hungry
as
a
wolf
lisbeth
thought
that
crookhorn
if
provided
with
a
stall
in
the
cow
house
would
act
like
a
reasonable
creature
again
but
neither
kjersti
nor
the
milkmaid
would
consent
to
the
removal
they
thought
a
goat
ought
not
to
be
humored
in
such
unreasonable
fancies
thus
it
was
that
lisbeth
had
not
had
much
to
do
during
her
first
month
at
hoel
farm
the
only
thing
that
kjersti
had
required
of
her
was
to
keep
her
own
little
room
under
the
hall
staircase
in
nice
order
and
that
she
had
done
every
day
she
had
made
the
bed
herself
and
every
saturday
she
had
washed
the
floor
and
the
shelf
and
spread
juniper
twigs
about
last
saturday
kjersti
had
come
out
to
take
a
look
at
it
and
had
said
to
her
that
she
kept
her
room
in
better
order
than
the
girls
in
the
south
chamber
kept
theirs
and
lisbeth
knew
that
this
was
true
for
she
had
noticed
it
herself
illustration
lisbeth
room
under
the
stairs
but
now
everything
was
going
to
be
different
kjersti
hoel
had
come
to
lisbeth
room
the
night
before
and
said
that
the
cows
were
to
be
let
out
early
in
the
morning
and
that
lisbeth
like
all
the
rest
of
the
hoel
farm
people
must
be
up
early
to
help
later
in
the
day
the
calves
that
had
been
born
in
the
cow
house
during
the
winter
were
to
be
let
out
for
the
first
time
and
lisbeth
would
have
to
look
after
them
for
that
afternoon
at
any
rate
kjersti
had
said
also
that
lisbeth
was
to
be
allowed
to
give
the
calves
their
names
names
that
they
would
keep
all
their
lives
even
after
they
had
grown
to
be
cows
the
next
day
after
the
letting
out
of
the
animals
lisbeth
was
to
take
a
lunch
bag
and
begin
her
spring
work
of
going
into
the
forest
all
day
to
watch
the
sheep
and
goats
it
would
not
do
to
have
them
running
about
the
fields
at
home
any
longer
kjersti
said
suddenly
lisbeth
recollected
what
it
was
that
she
had
pondered
over
so
long
as
she
lay
awake
the
evening
before
it
was
the
names
of
the
calves
in
spite
of
all
her
pondering
she
had
got
no
farther
than
to
wonder
whether
the
cow
with
the
red
sides
and
white
head
and
the
gentle
but
face
should
not
be
called
bliros
that
idea
however
she
had
given
up
it
seemed
to
her
that
only
one
cow
in
the
world
could
be
called
bliros
then
she
had
determined
to
think
no
longer
about
bliros
or
the
names
of
the
calves
and
so
had
fallen
asleep
what
if
she
had
overslept
herself
now
she
hoped
not
with
all
her
heart
for
she
had
heard
kjersti
hoel
say
that
she
did
not
like
girls
to
lie
abed
late
and
dally
in
the
morning
how
mortifying
it
would
be
for
her
not
to
be
on
the
spot
as
early
as
the
others
her
very
first
working
day
now
lisbeth
hopped
quickly
out
of
bed
and
popped
into
her
long
frock
then
having
made
her
bed
with
all
haste
she
opened
the
door
went
out
through
the
hall
way
and
stood
on
the
outside
steps
lisbeth
meant
to
be
very
neat
and
tidy
but
she
should
have
let
her
bed
air
longer
before
making
it
the
sun
had
just
risen
above
the
highest
spruce
tops
over
the
edge
of
the
eastern
hills
and
the
light
was
flooding
the
sides
of
the
valley
like
a
waterfall
in
the
meadows
and
on
the
sloping
fields
the
sunbeams
quivered
in
the
dew
they
sifted
in
gold
they
glittered
in
green
they
silvered
the
clear
brooks
that
babbled
down
the
hills
from
every
bush
came
a
twittering
and
chirping
and
clapping
of
wings
from
everything
everywhere
came
a
message
of
joy
and
activity
and
sprouting
life
mingled
in
one
great
morning
effervescence
single
sights
and
sounds
were
lost
only
the
call
of
the
cuckoo
far
up
on
the
slope
was
heard
above
the
other
sounds
and
from
every
shining
window
glanced
a
big
serene
eye
of
reflected
sun
rays
and
just
as
there
were
thousands
of
different
sounds
so
were
there
also
thousands
of
different
odors
from
the
steaming
earth
from
the
growing
grass
from
buds
and
blossoms
and
above
them
all
like
the
cuckoo
call
that
was
heard
above
the
thousands
of
blended
sounds
rose
the
fine
penetrating
fragrance
of
newly
sprouted
birch
trees
lisbeth
stood
still
awhile
drawing
deep
breaths
and
letting
the
sweet
air
and
the
effervescence
of
spring
stream
in
upon
her
then
she
looked
around
at
the
different
farm
buildings
quiet
brooded
within
them
and
every
door
was
shut
of
all
the
living
creatures
belonging
to
the
farm
not
one
was
to
be
seen
except
bearhunter
who
got
up
slowly
from
the
flat
stone
where
he
had
been
lying
comfortably
sunning
himself
and
came
over
to
her
looking
up
into
her
face
and
wagging
his
tail
truly
she
believed
she
was
the
first
one
up
on
the
whole
farm
well
of
course
she
would
have
to
wait
so
she
sat
herself
down
on
the
steps
oh
no
it
was
just
as
she
might
have
known
it
would
be
kjersti
hoel
was
up
lisbeth
heard
her
come
out
of
her
own
room
into
the
kitchen
take
a
big
stick
and
knock
three
times
on
the
ceiling
to
waken
the
girls
in
the
south
chamber
in
a
moment
lisbeth
heard
a
thump
thump
as
the
girls
hopped
out
of
bed
and
then
a
clattering
noise
as
they
put
on
their
shoes
soon
kjersti
came
out
of
the
house
she
was
going
over
to
the
building
where
the
men
slept
to
waken
them
catching
sight
of
lisbeth
she
exclaimed
no
this
can
not
be
lisbeth
already
up
what
a
little
girl
i
think
i
shall
have
to
make
you
head
milkmaid
at
this
lisbeth
became
so
shy
that
she
could
not
raise
her
eyes
to
look
at
kjersti
but
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
when
the
head
milkmaid
and
the
other
girls
came
downstairs
a
certain
small
nose
was
tilted
a
little
higher
than
usual
soon
there
was
life
and
motion
over
the
whole
farm
the
activity
was
very
different
from
that
of
ordinary
days
for
everything
was
done
with
extra
haste
and
all
that
was
done
seemed
to
have
some
connection
with
the
cow
house
the
doors
at
both
ends
of
this
building
stood
wide
open
and
every
one
seemed
to
have
an
errand
which
obliged
him
to
pass
through
the
spring
air
streaming
in
made
the
cows
turn
around
in
their
stalls
stretch
their
nostrils
and
look
out
when
kjersti
herself
appeared
on
the
scene
after
the
girls
had
begun
milking
and
talked
to
the
cows
and
patted
the
neck
of
the
bell
cow
the
creatures
at
once
realized
what
day
it
was
the
bell
cow
threw
up
her
head
and
bellowed
till
the
cow
house
echoed
that
was
a
signal
for
all
the
other
cows
they
pulled
at
their
chains
swung
their
tails
and
one
after
another
along
the
whole
row
joined
in
a
manifold
bellow
of
joyful
expectancy
that
shook
the
entire
cow
house
and
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
end
above
the
chorus
could
be
heard
the
bellowing
of
the
big
bull
deep
and
even
and
as
if
he
did
not
need
to
exert
himself
in
the
least
in
order
to
be
heard
although
everything
went
so
much
more
speedily
than
usual
the
time
seemed
long
to
lisbeth
longfrock
when
the
farm
people
went
into
the
house
to
eat
their
early
breakfast
she
could
not
understand
how
they
could
sit
at
the
table
so
long
she
finished
her
meal
very
quickly
and
asked
if
she
might
not
go
and
let
out
the
smaller
animals
the
sheep
and
the
goats
so
that
that
would
be
done
yes
kjersti
said
she
might
in
a
trice
therefore
she
had
them
out
and
as
usual
they
scattered
in
every
direction
leaping
and
capering
all
except
crookhorn
who
seized
her
chance
to
slink
into
the
cow
house
through
the
open
door
but
lisbeth
was
so
busy
that
she
did
not
notice
this
all
at
once
there
came
an
instant
stillness
as
if
everything
listened
then
from
the
farmhouse
the
tuneful
clanging
of
a
bell
was
heard
and
in
a
moment
this
was
answered
by
such
a
joyful
lowing
and
bellowing
such
a
sniffing
and
rattling
of
chains
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
thunderstorm
were
passing
over
the
farm
for
when
the
animals
recognized
the
sound
of
that
bell
which
they
had
not
heard
since
they
were
shut
up
in
the
cow
house
the
autumn
before
they
knew
that
the
time
for
being
let
out
into
the
open
air
was
close
at
hand
a
formal
procession
now
issued
from
the
farmhouse
kjersti
marched
at
the
front
carrying
the
big
cow
collar
to
which
the
bell
was
fastened
next
came
the
head
milkmaid
followed
by
the
then
the
girls
who
worked
in
the
farmhouse
and
then
the
two
farm
hands
with
thick
sticks
which
they
afterwards
dealt
out
to
the
company
giving
one
to
lisbeth
as
well
as
to
the
rest
last
of
all
came
bearhunter
who
also
wanted
to
have
a
part
in
what
was
going
on
when
the
procession
reached
the
cow
house
there
was
again
a
sudden
silence
the
cows
one
and
all
turned
their
heads
toward
the
people
as
they
came
in
and
looked
at
them
with
large
expectant
eyes
the
procession
then
divided
into
groups
and
definite
work
was
assigned
to
each
person
the
head
milkmaid
was
to
unfasten
the
cows
lisbeth
and
the
and
the
housemaids
each
with
her
stout
stick
were
to
steer
the
cows
out
through
the
door
the
farm
hands
were
to
stand
in
the
cow
lane
to
meet
the
creatures
and
guide
them
into
the
right
road
they
were
to
be
pastured
up
in
the
north
meadow
and
to
separate
those
who
fought
with
each
other
and
kjersti
and
bearhunter
were
to
watch
everything
from
the
gateway
all
was
ready
the
moment
for
the
start
had
come
kjersti
went
into
the
stall
of
the
cow
who
was
to
wear
the
bell
the
cow
straightened
herself
up
lifted
her
head
as
high
as
she
could
and
then
stood
she
knew
very
well
that
she
was
the
principal
cow
of
the
herd
and
that
the
first
place
when
they
went
out
and
in
through
the
door
belonged
to
her
but
she
knew
also
that
even
she
had
to
be
on
her
best
behavior
when
kjersti
the
mistress
of
the
whole
farm
did
her
the
honor
of
clasping
around
her
neck
the
cow
collar
with
its
bell
emblem
of
dignity
and
power
and
of
unfastening
the
chain
that
held
her
in
the
stall
kjersti
clasped
on
the
bell
and
unloosed
the
chain
which
fell
rattling
to
the
floor
and
then
the
bell
cow
swung
slowly
and
deliberately
out
of
the
stall
like
a
big
heavy
ship
out
of
its
dock
and
wended
her
way
with
solemn
dignity
toward
the
door
she
carried
her
head
so
high
and
so
stiffly
that
you
could
not
see
the
least
swaying
of
her
horns
and
her
bell
gave
only
a
single
decided
stroke
at
each
step
the
next
to
be
let
out
was
the
big
bull
the
head
milkmaid
unloosed
him
and
he
sailed
out
just
as
stiffly
and
heavily
as
the
bell
cow
had
done
with
horns
so
high
that
they
nearly
touched
the
roof
and
so
wide
apart
that
they
seemed
to
stretch
across
the
whole
passageway
lisbeth
had
never
realized
before
how
large
the
bull
was
and
then
one
by
one
in
regular
turn
the
rest
of
the
cows
marched
out
they
were
brindle
morlik
which
means
like
its
mother
goldie
speckle
blackie
pusher
darkey
wee
bonny
wreathie
and
moolley
wreathie
was
so
named
because
the
white
marks
on
her
hide
looked
something
like
a
wreath
mulley
cow
without
horns
beyond
the
cow
stalls
now
empty
were
the
stalls
of
the
heifers
whose
names
no
one
quite
remembered
as
yet
and
of
the
bulls
who
did
not
have
any
names
at
all
when
it
came
to
the
unloosing
of
the
heifers
and
young
bulls
the
scene
grew
livelier
and
livelier
they
stretched
their
necks
and
rubbed
against
their
chains
they
fell
on
their
knees
as
soon
as
the
unlooped
chains
slipped
from
their
necks
and
as
they
sprang
up
again
you
could
hear
their
legs
creak
so
stiff
were
they
from
standing
in
the
stall
all
winter
they
ran
plump
against
the
side
wall
or
up
into
the
wrong
passageway
they
dashed
noisily
against
the
door
two
reaching
it
at
the
same
time
and
trying
to
rush
through
together
but
getting
wedged
by
their
fat
sides
while
those
who
had
been
set
free
after
them
came
close
on
their
heels
pushing
clashing
their
horns
butting
and
bellowing
until
suddenly
the
blockade
being
broken
out
rushed
the
whole
throng
directly
in
the
wake
of
the
heifers
and
young
bulls
to
extreme
surprise
followed
crookhorn
who
kicking
up
her
heels
made
a
swift
dash
out
through
the
doorway
outside
the
cow
house
too
all
was
life
and
stir
as
the
animals
came
into
the
lane
they
lifted
their
heads
sniffed
the
air
from
the
mountain
side
and
became
eager
and
excited
old
cows
as
well
as
young
calves
kicked
up
their
hind
legs
and
made
frolicsome
leaps
this
way
and
that
they
rushed
playfully
or
angrily
at
each
other
clashing
their
horns
and
giving
a
short
bellow
if
worsted
in
the
tussle
then
they
dashed
off
to
assail
other
members
of
the
crowd
everything
combined
to
form
a
hubbub
of
lowing
and
bellowing
horn
clashing
and
fence
creaking
whacking
of
sticks
and
shouting
of
people
while
back
and
forth
through
all
the
confusion
with
his
horns
high
above
all
the
other
horns
went
the
big
bull
like
a
great
heavy
snowplow
clearing
the
way
of
the
whole
herd
only
one
cow
stood
undisturbed
amid
the
wild
uproar
calmly
waiting
and
looking
about
that
was
the
bell
cow
whom
of
course
none
of
the
other
cows
dared
to
disturb
at
last
the
head
milkmaid
came
to
the
front
and
gave
a
call
the
bell
cow
threw
up
her
head
and
with
a
loud
echoing
bellow
started
to
follow
her
next
came
brindle
still
sniffing
with
anger
after
her
many
encounters
she
had
got
the
best
of
all
who
were
worth
getting
the
best
of
and
if
she
could
not
be
the
bell
cow
she
would
at
any
rate
stand
next
to
her
directly
after
brindle
came
crookhorn
with
a
air
and
making
herself
as
tall
as
possible
but
brindle
was
in
no
mood
for
seeing
the
funny
side
of
things
so
she
lunged
out
with
one
of
her
long
hind
legs
and
gave
crookhorn
a
blow
on
the
head
that
made
the
prideful
goat
see
stars
but
crookhorn
merely
tossed
her
head
and
went
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
such
actions
she
thought
were
probably
customary
among
cows
the
head
milkmaid
kept
on
calling
and
the
cows
one
after
another
hearing
her
voice
started
toward
her
soon
the
whole
noisy
herd
led
by
the
bell
and
urged
by
shouts
and
flourishing
of
sticks
was
going
in
full
swing
toward
the
north
meadow
up
in
the
meadow
which
they
reached
after
a
while
the
ground
was
level
and
there
was
plenty
of
room
so
that
the
danger
of
collisions
and
other
accidents
was
lessened
the
young
creatures
danced
around
in
wild
play
and
those
of
the
cows
who
had
not
settled
the
question
of
mastery
fought
now
a
battle
that
was
to
be
decisive
for
the
whole
summer
soon
however
everything
became
quiet
again
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
all
of
the
animals
even
the
worst
combatants
were
grazing
placidly
side
by
side
after
this
the
farm
people
began
to
go
home
all
except
the
head
milkmaid
and
lisbeth
who
were
to
remain
a
while
longer
so
as
to
be
on
hand
in
case
anything
happened
and
something
did
happen
brindle
whose
quiet
behavior
had
been
only
temporary
soon
began
to
rove
uneasily
back
and
forth
sniffing
hard
was
really
the
one
who
ought
to
be
wearing
the
bell
she
sniffed
to
herself
and
then
suddenly
with
a
violent
rush
she
hurled
herself
at
the
bell
cow
such
a
fight
as
there
was
then
the
turf
flew
in
all
directions
soon
a
sharp
crack
was
heard
and
a
short
wild
bellow
and
one
of
horns
hung
dangling
brindle
shook
her
head
till
the
blood
splashed
then
giving
another
bellow
she
turned
and
ran
the
shortest
way
home
as
fast
as
her
legs
could
carry
her
never
stopping
until
she
had
reached
the
door
there
she
gave
vent
to
a
terrible
bellowing
as
if
she
wanted
to
bring
all
the
farm
buildings
down
over
the
people
ears
after
dinner
the
calves
were
let
out
lisbeth
had
finally
named
the
three
cow
calves
yellow
speckle
redsides
and
young
moolley
but
as
yet
she
had
found
no
name
to
suit
her
for
the
bull
calf
lisbeth
saw
plainly
that
kjersti
wondered
why
she
had
not
called
any
of
the
calves
after
bliros
gentle
cow
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
having
noticed
kjersti
thought
this
is
the
way
the
calves
were
induced
to
leave
their
pen
and
to
cross
the
floor
to
begin
with
a
pail
with
a
little
milk
in
it
was
held
out
to
each
calf
in
their
eagerness
to
get
the
milk
the
calves
thrust
their
heads
clear
into
the
pails
and
when
the
persons
holding
these
began
to
run
the
calves
ran
too
with
the
pails
over
their
heads
like
hats
outside
the
door
the
pails
were
snatched
off
and
there
stood
the
calves
who
had
never
before
been
beyond
their
pen
in
the
very
midst
of
the
great
wonderful
new
world
the
startled
creatures
gave
an
amazed
look
and
then
began
to
back
just
as
if
they
felt
themselves
suddenly
standing
at
the
head
of
a
steep
stairway
but
soon
they
ventured
to
put
one
foot
carefully
forward
then
another
and
another
it
was
slow
work
one
step
at
a
time
but
at
length
they
found
that
there
was
firm
ground
in
this
new
region
they
concluded
that
the
world
was
only
a
larger
calf
pen
after
all
but
it
was
a
wonderfully
light
calf
pen
and
its
walls
were
certainly
a
long
way
off
swish
up
went
their
tails
into
the
air
and
away
they
scampered
like
the
wildest
of
forest
animals
then
began
a
great
race
in
the
big
field
from
fence
to
fence
this
way
and
that
crosswise
and
round
and
round
every
time
the
calves
jumped
over
a
hillock
kjersti
and
lisbeth
saw
their
tails
stand
straight
up
against
the
sky
like
tillers
lisbeth
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
funny
but
they
could
not
keep
together
long
they
soon
ran
off
in
various
directions
and
in
the
evening
lisbeth
had
to
go
to
the
farthest
corners
of
the
field
with
a
pail
and
coax
them
home
one
by
one
for
of
course
they
did
not
have
sense
enough
to
know
when
to
go
home
they
who
were
out
in
the
world
for
the
first
time
lisbeth
was
lying
again
in
her
little
room
it
was
the
evening
of
her
first
working
day
she
had
said
her
simple
evening
prayer
as
usual
and
then
stretched
herself
out
on
the
bed
feeling
how
good
it
was
to
rest
for
her
body
was
tired
through
and
through
what
a
day
it
had
been
a
long
day
too
she
knew
nevertheless
she
could
not
imagine
where
it
had
gone
she
felt
that
she
must
think
over
all
that
had
happened
but
drowsiness
came
stealing
upon
her
and
threw
the
scenes
of
the
day
into
confusion
she
saw
a
pair
of
big
horns
that
plowed
like
a
snow
plow
through
a
swarming
crowd
and
then
she
saw
brindle
standing
in
her
stall
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
a
big
bandage
over
one
of
her
horns
looking
exactly
like
an
old
peasant
woman
with
a
kerchief
tied
around
her
head
for
a
headache
and
then
she
thought
she
saw
written
in
the
air
a
couplet
that
she
had
once
heard
rearing
its
tail
against
the
sky
danced
the
calf
on
the
hilltop
high
and
then
lisbeth
longfrock
fell
asleep
the
next
day
with
the
lunch
bag
upon
her
back
lisbeth
longfrock
set
out
for
a
forest
that
lay
not
far
off
taking
the
sheep
and
goats
with
her
she
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
crookhorn
to
go
along
however
the
goat
had
taken
the
shortest
cut
up
to
the
north
meadow
where
the
cows
were
again
pastured
lisbeth
second
working
day
like
her
first
seemed
a
very
long
one
for
the
forest
was
wonderfully
lonesome
and
still
the
little
girl
had
time
to
think
of
many
many
things
of
her
mother
and
jacob
and
peerout
castle
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
she
cried
a
wee
bit
too
chapter
v
summer
taking
the
animals
up
to
the
sæter
upward
over
the
open
slope
across
the
valley
from
hoel
farm
a
lengthy
procession
was
taking
its
way
kjersti
hoel
stood
at
the
window
of
her
room
following
the
procession
with
her
eyes
as
long
as
she
could
for
soon
it
would
vanish
from
the
open
slope
into
the
wooded
part
of
the
mountain
the
herds
belonging
to
hoel
farm
were
that
day
being
taken
up
to
the
sæter
to
spend
the
summer
grazing
on
the
rich
grass
which
grows
in
sunny
spaces
here
and
there
on
the
mountain
heights
pronounced
approximately
at
the
head
of
the
procession
rode
the
milkmaid
on
the
military
horse
which
for
this
occasion
had
a
woman
saddle
upon
its
back
the
saddle
had
a
high
frame
so
that
it
looked
almost
like
an
and
the
milkmaid
sitting
aloft
on
it
dressed
in
her
best
and
with
a
white
linen
kerchief
on
her
head
was
rosy
plump
and
also
somewhat
for
was
not
she
the
most
important
person
in
the
company
the
one
who
was
to
give
all
the
commands
in
some
districts
of
norway
the
farmers
are
required
to
keep
one
or
more
horses
subject
to
the
needs
of
the
government
under
certain
conditions
of
use
and
payment
after
her
came
two
farm
hands
each
leading
a
horse
whose
back
fairly
curved
in
under
its
heavy
load
then
followed
the
herds
in
order
of
rank
first
came
the
bell
cow
then
brindle
with
her
wounded
horn
that
had
grown
on
awry
then
crookhorn
then
darkey
and
behind
darkey
the
whole
long
train
of
cows
all
except
two
old
moolley
and
the
pet
wee
bonny
who
were
to
stay
at
home
to
furnish
milk
for
the
people
there
and
to
teach
the
new
calves
to
follow
after
the
cows
stalked
the
big
bull
as
if
acting
as
rear
guard
for
his
herd
next
came
the
goats
hurrying
along
and
trying
to
get
ahead
then
the
sheep
in
a
tight
clump
and
behind
these
four
great
pigs
and
a
few
calves
while
at
the
very
end
of
the
train
came
the
and
lisbeth
longfrock
with
her
lunch
bag
on
her
back
in
the
beginning
all
had
gone
as
gayly
as
a
dance
for
almost
every
one
had
pleasant
memories
of
the
summer
before
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
reach
the
mountain
top
quickly
enough
but
as
they
mounted
the
way
became
steeper
and
steeper
and
the
sun
rose
higher
and
higher
burning
their
backs
the
pigs
began
to
lag
behind
trying
to
branch
off
at
every
side
path
so
as
to
get
a
little
nap
in
the
shade
or
cool
themselves
in
a
mudhole
the
sheep
and
goats
feeling
the
need
of
something
in
their
stomachs
slipped
aside
whenever
they
spied
a
young
birch
tree
whose
leaves
they
could
nibble
or
a
fence
to
peep
through
or
a
plot
of
green
grass
the
last
year
calves
who
had
not
been
to
the
sæter
before
saw
no
reason
at
all
for
hurrying
and
made
no
attempt
at
it
except
when
the
stick
was
used
upon
them
so
lisbeth
longfrock
had
to
keep
rushing
off
the
road
into
side
paths
behind
bushes
into
forest
thickets
and
boggy
marshes
to
drag
the
various
creatures
back
into
line
and
scarcely
did
she
get
them
safely
into
the
road
from
one
side
before
they
slipped
out
again
on
the
other
she
had
to
take
off
one
of
her
long
knitted
garters
and
tie
it
around
her
waist
so
that
she
could
tuck
her
long
frock
up
out
of
the
way
for
she
was
constantly
on
the
run
coaxing
shouting
and
circumventing
it
was
a
hard
struggle
her
light
hair
became
dripping
wet
and
her
face
was
as
red
as
a
mountain
cranberry
but
lisbeth
did
not
notice
her
discomfort
so
absorbed
was
she
in
what
she
had
to
do
the
would
return
to
the
farm
with
the
men
when
the
sæter
was
reached
it
was
lisbeth
who
was
to
have
the
responsibility
for
the
smaller
animals
during
the
whole
summer
and
who
was
to
bring
them
home
in
the
autumn
fat
and
glossy
she
and
the
head
milkmaid
had
their
special
responsibilities
each
at
her
own
end
of
the
line
as
it
were
and
even
if
lisbeth
was
only
the
tail
end
she
did
not
wish
to
have
the
disgrace
of
being
unable
to
keep
it
in
order
the
procession
continued
mounting
higher
and
higher
and
soon
the
whole
valley
lay
below
deep
and
wide
and
delicately
green
the
fir
trees
became
smaller
and
more
scattered
the
slender
birches
grew
closer
together
before
long
the
first
specimens
of
black
crowberries
and
old
woman
switches
dwarf
birch
trees
were
seen
and
with
that
the
procession
was
up
over
the
crest
of
the
mountain
side
illustration
the
valley
and
the
farms
then
all
at
once
it
seemed
as
if
a
heavy
weight
slipped
off
as
if
all
weariness
was
smoothed
away
from
man
and
beast
the
whole
mountain
sent
its
freshness
and
peace
streaming
over
them
they
were
in
a
new
world
before
them
with
its
boundless
surface
broken
into
level
spaces
and
undulating
slopes
lay
the
mountain
top
stretching
itself
far
far
away
until
lost
in
the
deepening
blue
of
a
summit
if
they
looked
back
the
valley
seemed
to
have
sunk
out
of
sight
but
on
the
mountain
top
across
the
valley
they
could
see
wide
expanses
of
open
land
dotted
with
shining
water
and
grassy
sæter
districts
drawing
a
long
breath
all
gazed
silently
around
what
a
tranquillity
lay
over
everything
of
their
own
accord
the
animals
fell
into
order
along
the
stony
road
curving
endlessly
beyond
them
they
made
no
more
attempts
to
branch
off
into
side
paths
but
walked
slowly
along
at
an
even
pace
that
gave
lisbeth
a
little
time
to
view
her
surroundings
she
had
never
seen
a
place
so
broad
and
open
and
up
here
she
was
to
spend
the
whole
bright
summer
all
at
once
in
the
midst
of
this
vastness
and
space
lisbeth
felt
herself
so
wonderfully
little
but
she
was
not
at
all
terrified
she
only
felt
very
solemn
and
peaceful
she
began
to
think
of
the
future
of
the
rest
of
the
day
the
coming
summer
and
the
many
summers
that
would
follow
sometime
she
herself
would
be
big
and
grown
up
like
the
head
milkmaid
whom
she
could
now
see
sitting
on
the
high
saddle
far
ahead
sometime
she
herself
would
sit
up
there
perhaps
and
ride
at
the
front
the
pack
horses
refused
to
go
slowly
now
even
under
their
heavy
loads
they
forged
ahead
passed
the
mounted
milkmaid
and
soon
disappeared
over
a
distant
ridge
the
procession
followed
slowly
hour
after
hour
it
wound
its
curving
way
over
ridges
and
brooks
past
sæters
and
shining
mountain
lakes
lisbeth
had
the
honor
of
sitting
up
in
the
saddle
and
riding
awhile
the
milkmaid
feeling
that
she
would
gladly
walk
a
little
evening
began
to
draw
nigh
they
took
their
way
high
up
through
a
gap
in
the
mountain
which
they
had
seen
in
the
distance
early
in
the
morning
after
that
the
road
began
to
descend
they
met
with
birch
trees
again
and
one
single
warped
fir
tree
and
from
below
they
heard
the
rushing
sound
of
a
large
river
they
reached
at
last
the
edge
of
the
sæter
valley
to
which
they
were
bound
and
stood
still
to
look
down
below
them
lay
a
comparatively
level
space
peaceful
and
green
with
its
three
sæter
huts
belonging
to
hoegseth
lunde
and
hoel
farms
from
the
chimneys
of
two
of
the
huts
smoke
was
ascending
in
the
still
afternoon
air
pronounce
the
like
the
in
and
like
as
in
the
gazers
were
filled
with
delight
this
then
was
the
spot
where
they
were
to
spend
the
summer
the
cows
began
to
bellow
the
smaller
animals
one
and
all
started
on
a
run
past
the
cows
and
down
the
hill
early
the
next
morning
lisbeth
was
on
her
way
across
the
mountain
pasture
with
the
small
animals
in
her
charge
she
did
not
have
the
lunch
bag
on
her
back
now
for
while
she
was
up
at
the
sæter
she
was
to
take
dinner
at
the
hut
every
noon
the
sunshine
was
brilliant
the
cows
had
been
turned
loose
and
were
walking
away
on
the
nearest
cow
path
going
in
single
file
as
if
strung
on
a
line
the
leader
bell
rang
deeply
and
regularly
its
tone
mingling
with
others
quite
as
deep
from
the
neighboring
sæters
and
in
upon
this
solemn
ringing
broke
the
delicate
brisk
of
the
smaller
creatures
bells
the
time
had
now
come
when
lisbeth
longfrock
was
to
make
her
first
entrance
into
the
vast
unknown
the
milkmaid
had
told
her
that
while
tending
her
animals
this
first
day
she
should
not
wander
too
far
lest
she
might
not
be
able
to
find
her
way
back
she
was
to
listen
to
the
other
herders
and
keep
near
them
the
milkmaid
did
not
know
whether
the
other
herders
were
boys
or
girls
this
year
lisbeth
kept
looking
back
every
now
and
then
to
keep
track
of
the
way
she
had
come
and
was
apparently
loath
to
lose
sight
of
the
hut
but
the
animals
drifted
rapidly
off
in
the
distance
and
she
had
to
follow
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
them
altogether
and
after
a
while
when
she
looked
back
the
hut
could
not
be
seen
around
her
were
only
the
unending
wastes
of
hill
and
marsh
and
the
faraway
mountain
peaks
how
spacious
and
silent
it
was
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
except
that
of
the
bells
not
even
the
river
rushing
harmonies
reached
up
to
where
she
stood
she
suddenly
felt
herself
so
utterly
alone
and
remote
and
had
such
a
longing
to
caress
some
living
creature
that
she
went
among
the
flock
and
petted
now
this
one
and
now
that
the
bell
goat
became
so
envious
that
it
butted
the
others
out
of
the
way
and
stood
rubbing
itself
against
her
all
at
once
there
came
a
call
so
loud
and
clear
that
the
mountains
echoed
with
it
the
goats
pricked
up
their
ears
and
lisbeth
too
listened
breathlessly
the
call
was
so
unexpected
that
she
had
not
distinguished
from
what
quarter
it
came
it
sounded
near
and
yet
because
of
the
echoes
from
all
directions
this
time
the
call
was
still
louder
presently
she
heard
bells
several
bells
and
then
she
saw
a
large
flock
of
sheep
and
goats
come
straggling
over
the
crest
of
a
hill
very
likely
it
was
the
other
herders
who
were
calling
lisbeth
saw
two
straw
hats
rise
above
the
hill
and
by
degrees
two
tall
boys
seemed
to
grow
up
out
of
the
hilltop
boys
about
as
big
as
jacob
at
sight
of
them
lisbeth
felt
so
shy
that
she
kneeled
down
and
hid
herself
behind
a
bushy
little
mound
the
boys
shaded
their
eyes
with
their
hands
and
looked
down
from
the
hilltop
they
called
and
then
listened
no
answer
all
was
still
then
one
of
the
boys
cried
out
oh
ho
you
boy
from
hoel
do
you
hear
if
you
have
pluck
we
call
you
to
appear
they
stood
awhile
watching
then
they
darted
forward
turned
two
or
three
somersaults
and
ran
down
the
hill
toward
her
repeating
their
call
and
shouting
again
they
stopped
and
listened
as
if
uncertain
again
they
challenged
if
you
lie
hid
behind
some
bush
or
stone
come
out
and
show
there
marrow
in
your
bone
then
the
two
boys
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
lisbeth
flock
was
and
looked
around
no
they
did
not
see
any
one
the
new
herder
from
hoel
who
dared
to
lose
track
of
his
flock
the
first
day
must
be
a
reckless
young
scamp
a
fellow
it
might
be
fun
to
get
acquainted
with
very
likely
he
had
heard
of
their
bathing
place
in
the
sloping
marsh
probably
that
was
where
he
had
gone
now
well
they
would
take
his
animals
with
them
and
go
there
themselves
but
first
they
would
give
another
call
perhaps
he
was
not
so
far
away
but
that
he
might
hear
if
they
gave
a
good
loud
one
from
far
away
echo
repeated
the
sounds
in
dwarf
language
as
the
norwegian
boys
call
it
when
all
was
still
again
there
sounded
close
at
hand
as
thin
and
clear
as
the
peep
of
a
bird
this
was
from
lisbeth
who
when
she
heard
that
they
were
going
to
take
her
flock
away
felt
that
she
ought
to
call
out
although
it
was
extremely
embarrassing
the
boys
stopped
short
greatly
astonished
from
behind
the
bushy
little
mound
there
arose
something
small
just
like
a
tiny
hill
woman
in
a
plaid
neckerchief
and
a
long
frock
who
stood
and
looked
at
them
with
large
shy
eyes
at
sight
of
her
the
boys
were
somewhat
abashed
it
was
a
little
embarrassing
for
them
to
find
that
their
boastful
taunting
rhymes
had
been
directed
against
a
poor
timorous
young
one
and
a
girl
at
that
but
it
was
exasperating
too
for
they
had
expected
to
see
a
comrade
of
their
own
size
humph
any
one
could
see
that
hoel
farm
had
women
folk
at
the
head
of
it
the
mistress
was
not
willing
that
even
the
herder
should
be
a
boy
if
the
young
one
had
only
been
bigger
bigger
than
themselves
they
could
have
shown
their
contempt
for
her
and
chased
her
but
that
little
midget
no
indeed
fellows
like
them
did
not
waste
either
words
or
blows
on
such
small
fry
it
would
be
a
good
plan
however
to
talk
with
her
a
bit
and
hear
whether
another
herder
was
not
coming
to
take
her
place
after
that
they
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
they
could
get
along
by
themselves
for
one
summer
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
frighten
her
a
little
so
that
she
would
keep
out
of
their
way
they
came
over
to
lisbeth
and
stood
before
her
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
then
one
of
them
said
are
you
going
to
be
the
hoel
herder
this
summer
yes
answered
lisbeth
then
as
if
to
excuse
herself
she
added
quickly
kjersti
wanted
me
to
what
is
your
name
lisbeth
and
jacob
calls
me
longfrock
where
are
you
from
from
peerout
are
you
jacob
peerout
sister
we
went
to
school
with
him
last
winter
yes
i
am
what
a
nuisance
that
jacob
himself
did
not
come
we
have
any
use
at
all
for
young
ones
like
you
up
here
the
speaker
who
was
the
larger
of
the
two
boys
stood
awhile
waiting
for
a
reply
but
lisbeth
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
to
his
remark
and
therefore
said
nothing
so
he
continued
well
we
only
wanted
to
say
to
you
i
ole
hoegseth
and
that
fellow
over
there
is
peter
lunde
that
you
must
keep
out
of
our
way
you
must
not
dare
to
come
a
step
beyond
a
line
running
from
pancake
stone
down
around
the
sloping
marsh
to
the
pointing
stump
near
the
hoegseth
cow
path
if
you
let
your
animals
graze
beyond
that
line
your
brother
jacob
next
winter
shall
get
all
the
thrashings
you
ought
to
have
this
summer
lisbeth
was
dreadfully
frightened
and
her
mouth
began
to
tremble
then
the
second
boy
said
to
the
larger
one
yes
but
jacob
is
so
strong
that
he
will
get
the
best
of
you
not
when
i
have
brought
myself
into
good
training
hoi
and
he
turned
a
handspring
now
you
know
what
jacob
may
expect
so
take
care
what
you
do
we
boys
are
going
up
to
the
sloping
marsh
to
bathe
with
shout
and
call
they
took
their
way
up
over
the
hill
again
at
the
top
they
looked
back
and
then
glanced
a
little
dubiously
at
each
other
lisbeth
longfrock
was
still
standing
where
they
had
left
her
and
she
was
crying
lisbeth
felt
very
small
and
forlorn
as
she
stood
there
she
certainly
did
not
want
to
do
anything
that
jacob
would
get
a
thrashing
for
if
she
only
knew
where
it
was
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
but
she
had
not
the
least
idea
where
either
the
pointing
stump
or
the
sloping
marsh
lay
all
that
she
could
do
would
be
to
keep
with
her
animals
and
find
out
about
these
places
later
sometime
afterwards
when
lisbeth
had
mounted
a
small
round
hill
she
heard
the
bells
of
the
boys
flocks
again
that
gave
her
a
fright
and
she
began
to
chase
her
animals
off
in
another
direction
but
as
she
turned
around
to
do
so
she
saw
far
far
down
the
marsh
two
white
figures
running
jumping
and
playing
leapfrog
in
the
sunshine
beside
a
gleaming
pond
the
boys
had
let
their
flocks
stray
away
from
them
lisbeth
dreaded
incurring
more
displeasure
but
surely
something
ought
to
be
done
there
was
no
help
for
it
she
would
really
have
to
take
care
of
the
stray
animals
for
a
while
the
boys
could
not
be
angry
at
that
she
knew
because
the
greatest
disgrace
that
can
befall
a
herder
is
the
losing
of
his
flock
and
for
boys
so
big
as
these
to
go
back
to
the
sæter
without
any
animals
would
be
especially
humiliating
so
lisbeth
went
to
work
gathering
the
flocks
together
jumping
up
on
a
mound
every
now
and
then
to
see
if
the
boys
were
not
ready
to
come
but
they
appeared
to
have
forgotten
everything
except
their
play
at
length
she
saw
that
the
boys
suddenly
stood
still
and
listened
peering
about
in
all
directions
then
they
started
into
activity
again
snatched
up
their
clothes
put
them
on
in
great
haste
and
started
off
on
a
run
toward
the
opposite
edge
of
the
marsh
every
little
while
they
would
stop
and
listen
and
then
run
on
again
they
were
so
far
off
that
there
was
no
use
in
lisbeth
shouting
to
them
or
trying
to
give
the
call
when
the
boys
reached
a
round
hill
that
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
they
ran
to
the
top
and
again
peered
in
all
directions
for
a
long
time
then
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
they
made
their
way
back
across
the
marsh
straight
toward
the
small
round
hill
where
lisbeth
was
as
they
neared
it
lisbeth
thought
that
now
was
the
time
to
give
the
herder
call
for
the
flocks
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
and
their
bells
could
not
be
heard
by
the
boys
her
first
call
was
too
weak
she
gave
another
somewhat
stronger
the
boys
stopped
and
answered
lisbeth
called
again
and
then
the
boys
came
up
the
hill
they
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
break
the
silence
it
was
rather
annoying
to
be
obliged
to
question
that
young
one
about
their
flocks
but
there
was
no
other
way
have
you
seen
our
animals
lisbeth
looked
at
them
pleadingly
they
are
here
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
have
been
taking
care
of
them
but
you
must
not
thrash
jacob
for
it
the
boys
looked
as
they
felt
rather
crestfallen
but
they
had
to
say
something
so
ole
remarked
as
they
turned
and
left
her
oh
well
we
let
him
off
for
this
one
time
when
lisbeth
went
to
fasten
the
gate
of
the
fold
that
evening
peter
lunde
came
bobbing
along
outside
the
fence
you
have
a
strange
sheep
here
have
you
no
i
have
counted
mine
well
perhaps
i
counted
mine
wrong
very
likely
they
are
all
there
the
two
stood
looking
at
each
other
for
a
while
then
both
grew
shy
and
had
to
turn
their
eyes
away
at
last
peter
said
lisbeth
if
you
want
to
you
may
tend
your
flock
wherever
we
tend
ours
and
you
may
come
to
our
pond
i
understood
ole
to
say
that
he
is
willing
too
but
if
he
makes
any
fuss
about
it
why
i
thrash
him
if
i
really
want
to
yes
i
will
come
gladly
you
may
be
sure
well
then
i
will
come
after
you
morning
back
of
the
hill
here
lisbeth
did
not
get
a
chance
to
say
anything
more
for
peter
was
off
like
a
flash
around
the
corner
he
had
seen
ole
coming
ole
came
lounging
along
in
his
usual
fashion
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
have
seen
a
strange
sheep
have
you
no
humph
is
one
of
yours
missing
oh
i
do
know
exactly
humph
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
that
you
need
not
bother
yourself
about
what
i
said
i
did
not
mean
anything
by
it
it
was
peter
that
made
me
say
it
and
if
you
want
me
to
i
can
thrash
him
for
it
chapter
vi
the
taming
of
crookhorn
it
was
early
morning
in
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
and
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
over
hoel
sæter
lisbeth
was
alone
inside
the
fold
milking
goats
all
was
quiet
and
peaceful
not
a
bell
was
heard
the
only
sounds
were
the
gentle
rush
of
the
river
far
below
and
an
occasional
soft
thud
from
the
cow
house
when
a
cow
bumped
her
horns
against
the
wall
in
getting
up
the
milkmaid
was
inside
the
cow
house
milking
the
cows
lisbeth
hands
were
still
too
small
for
that
work
so
it
had
been
arranged
that
she
should
have
entire
charge
of
the
goats
instead
of
helping
with
the
larger
animals
suddenly
from
the
hill
above
the
sæter
rang
out
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
call
was
answered
a
little
farther
off
with
a
touch
of
irritation
in
the
tone
illustration
up
at
the
sæter
lisbeth
looked
up
and
listened
then
with
a
smile
of
happy
satisfaction
she
went
over
to
the
fence
and
called
now
she
could
send
out
the
tones
with
vigor
so
that
they
rang
back
from
all
the
hills
around
her
voice
no
longer
trembled
when
she
answered
the
big
call
she
knew
that
they
were
calling
especially
to
summon
her
and
that
they
dared
to
come
close
to
the
sæter
with
their
animals
because
they
had
an
errand
something
that
they
had
planned
with
the
milkmaid
and
lisbeth
by
the
sound
of
the
bells
she
could
tell
that
the
boys
were
driving
the
animals
as
fast
as
they
could
the
boy
that
was
behind
peter
of
course
was
provoked
at
not
being
first
but
if
you
please
they
would
have
to
wait
until
she
had
finished
her
work
they
were
out
extremely
early
however
strange
it
may
seem
lisbeth
longfrock
soon
after
her
arrival
at
hoel
sæter
had
become
a
prime
favorite
with
the
other
herders
the
day
after
her
first
painful
experiences
the
boys
as
proposed
had
met
her
behind
the
hill
peter
first
and
then
ole
no
reference
was
made
to
the
previous
day
it
was
merely
taken
for
granted
that
in
future
she
would
be
with
them
ole
said
that
she
could
look
after
their
animals
together
with
her
own
while
they
went
off
to
bathe
peter
thought
she
could
too
so
she
agreed
to
the
arrangement
but
the
boys
did
not
play
very
long
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
that
day
when
they
had
finished
bathing
it
was
not
much
fun
after
all
to
be
down
there
by
themselves
so
it
had
come
to
pass
that
lisbeth
and
her
animals
never
came
strolling
over
the
hill
in
the
morning
without
meeting
the
boys
they
generally
came
at
nearly
the
same
time
each
from
the
direction
of
his
own
sæter
apparently
trying
to
see
who
could
be
the
first
to
give
the
call
but
when
they
met
each
did
his
best
to
make
out
to
the
other
that
he
had
come
there
by
the
merest
chance
both
sheepishly
realizing
that
the
very
evening
before
they
had
put
on
airs
about
that
young
one
whom
they
could
never
get
rid
of
and
had
said
that
they
would
go
off
in
an
entirely
different
direction
the
next
day
to
avoid
her
if
possible
often
the
boys
would
have
athletic
contests
turning
handsprings
and
wrestling
from
one
to
another
because
neither
boy
was
willing
to
give
up
beaten
more
than
once
in
a
single
morning
or
afternoon
would
lisbeth
have
to
remind
them
to
look
after
their
animals
because
completely
forgotten
by
the
boys
the
flocks
had
strayed
nearly
out
of
sight
occasionally
it
happened
that
one
boy
would
reach
hoel
sæter
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
before
the
other
and
would
find
lisbeth
ready
to
set
out
in
that
case
the
first
comer
would
insist
that
he
and
lisbeth
should
start
out
by
themselves
urging
that
the
other
boy
had
probably
gone
somewhere
else
that
day
such
times
were
almost
the
pleasantest
lisbeth
thought
for
then
the
one
boy
had
always
so
much
to
show
her
that
the
other
boy
did
not
know
about
a
marshy
ledge
white
as
snow
with
cloudberry
blossoms
where
there
would
be
many
many
berries
in
the
autumn
that
ledge
they
could
keep
for
themselves
it
was
not
worth
while
to
let
the
other
boy
know
about
everything
they
found
or
a
ptarmigan
nest
with
thirteen
big
eggs
in
it
or
a
ridge
where
scouring
rushes
grew
unusually
long
and
thick
a
species
of
horsetail
rush
having
a
rough
flinty
surface
it
is
used
for
scouring
and
polishing
each
boy
talked
more
with
her
too
when
by
himself
and
was
less
boastful
and
rough
and
the
one
boy
would
climb
trees
and
get
spruce
gum
for
her
while
she
would
seek
scouring
rush
for
him
scouring
rush
is
something
that
requires
a
special
knack
in
the
one
who
is
to
discover
it
and
the
boys
had
never
seen
lisbeth
equal
in
spying
it
out
peter
said
that
if
there
was
a
single
spear
growing
anywhere
you
might
be
sure
that
she
would
find
it
to
which
ole
jokingly
responded
that
for
his
part
he
believed
she
could
find
one
even
where
there
was
any
and
how
many
many
things
both
boys
thought
of
that
they
could
make
one
day
when
it
rained
ole
made
lisbeth
a
hat
out
of
birch
bark
and
the
next
day
peter
came
with
a
pair
of
shoes
for
her
the
milkmaid
must
have
laughed
when
she
saw
lisbeth
coming
home
that
second
day
wearing
the
hat
and
shoes
and
carrying
her
ordinary
shoes
in
her
hand
another
day
ole
gave
her
a
pocketknife
she
ought
to
have
something
to
whittle
with
he
thought
and
he
did
not
need
that
knife
because
he
had
one
with
a
sheath
that
he
always
wore
in
his
belt
the
next
day
peter
brought
her
a
musical
horn
that
he
had
made
in
the
evenings
from
a
goat
horn
it
had
an
unusually
fine
tone
you
could
manage
to
play
that
funny
tune
old
woman
with
a
stick
on
it
after
a
fashion
ole
speculated
a
while
as
to
what
he
could
do
to
beat
that
and
then
he
hit
upon
an
idea
he
would
tame
crookhorn
they
had
often
seen
crookhorn
going
with
the
cows
as
if
she
were
one
of
them
and
they
knew
that
though
she
was
lisbeth
own
goat
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
make
her
go
with
the
other
goats
the
little
girl
had
told
them
how
impossible
it
had
been
to
manage
the
creature
at
the
farm
and
that
kjersti
had
said
the
men
would
have
to
make
an
end
of
her
when
winter
came
so
ole
offered
to
tame
crookhorn
he
was
sure
that
he
could
teach
her
to
go
with
the
others
there
had
never
been
a
goat
yet
that
had
not
been
forced
to
yield
when
he
attempted
to
master
it
yes
indeed
lisbeth
was
more
than
willing
for
him
to
try
if
he
succeeded
she
would
gladly
give
him
all
she
owned
no
ole
did
not
want
any
payment
for
doing
it
but
if
she
insisted
on
giving
him
something
he
would
like
the
goat
horns
after
the
goat
was
slaughtered
as
it
would
have
to
be
some
day
they
would
make
matchless
horns
to
blow
upon
but
peter
too
wanted
to
have
a
share
in
the
undertaking
if
the
goat
proved
to
be
very
cross
and
obstinate
two
persons
would
surely
be
needed
to
tame
her
then
they
could
have
one
horn
apiece
ole
did
not
know
whether
he
would
agree
to
that
or
not
for
it
was
he
who
had
thought
of
the
plan
yes
but
how
could
he
carry
it
out
peter
did
not
believe
that
crookhorn
could
be
made
to
go
with
the
other
goats
unless
there
was
a
stronger
goat
for
her
to
be
fastened
to
ole
did
not
have
such
a
one
it
was
peter
who
had
the
big
billy
goat
the
only
one
strong
enough
for
the
task
yes
that
was
true
so
peter
might
help
in
taming
crookhorn
if
he
would
lend
his
billy
goat
lisbeth
for
her
part
thought
they
ought
all
to
help
that
was
the
only
proper
way
and
her
suggestion
was
finally
followed
ole
taming
of
crookhorn
was
the
errand
that
brought
the
boys
to
the
hoel
sæter
on
the
morning
that
lisbeth
and
the
milkmaid
were
doing
their
milking
so
early
the
two
flocks
came
pushing
and
crowding
over
the
hill
but
as
soon
as
the
animals
realized
that
they
were
to
be
allowed
to
go
close
to
the
sæter
they
began
to
run
at
full
speed
it
was
always
such
fun
to
go
to
a
strange
place
they
would
be
sure
to
find
something
new
to
see
and
to
stick
their
noses
into
perhaps
a
little
milk
stirabout
in
the
pig
trough
a
little
salt
on
the
salting
stone
or
a
hole
in
the
fence
where
one
could
get
a
chance
to
squeeze
through
without
being
seen
the
bells
clanged
the
boys
ran
about
shouting
and
hallooing
and
giving
their
musical
calls
trying
to
keep
the
worst
goats
in
order
but
perhaps
making
a
little
more
noise
than
was
necessary
where
all
had
been
so
still
before
there
was
now
the
liveliest
commotion
the
milkmaid
could
not
resist
going
to
the
door
to
look
out
and
lisbeth
would
surely
have
forgotten
to
milk
the
last
of
her
goats
if
it
had
not
come
over
to
her
of
its
own
accord
and
stood
directly
in
her
way
as
she
was
going
out
of
the
fold
when
ole
saw
the
milkmaid
at
the
door
he
called
out
shall
you
not
let
out
your
cattle
soon
yes
i
am
just
ready
to
answered
the
milkmaid
are
you
ready
lisbeth
i
am
milking
my
last
goat
soon
everything
was
done
and
the
animals
stood
waiting
to
be
let
out
ole
had
with
him
a
strong
band
woven
of
willow
withes
with
an
ingeniously
fastened
loop
at
each
end
one
loop
was
for
peter
billy
goat
the
other
for
crookhorn
ole
thought
it
was
a
very
fine
apparatus
indeed
where
is
crookhorn
in
the
cow
house
then
i
had
better
go
in
and
get
her
myself
bring
your
goat
peter
and
hold
him
ready
peter
called
his
big
billy
goat
it
knew
its
name
and
came
at
once
let
me
see
how
strong
you
are
said
peter
he
took
hold
of
its
horns
held
its
head
down
and
pushed
against
it
the
billy
goat
bunted
took
a
fresh
start
bunted
again
they
often
played
in
this
way
and
sent
peter
against
the
fence
there
exclaimed
peter
picking
himself
up
i
rather
think
that
billy
goat
is
strong
enough
to
drag
any
goat
along
no
matter
how
big
a
one
peter
fairly
glowed
with
pride
ole
too
wanted
to
try
the
strength
of
the
goat
yes
it
was
an
amazingly
strong
goat
then
ole
went
into
the
cow
house
and
in
a
few
moments
came
back
leading
crookhorn
by
the
band
of
willow
withes
the
next
step
was
to
fasten
the
other
loop
around
the
billy
goat
neck
and
behold
there
stood
the
two
goats
harnessed
together
but
neither
of
them
seemed
to
notice
that
anything
had
been
done
lisbeth
and
the
milkmaid
and
the
boys
waited
a
while
expectantly
but
the
billy
goat
rather
enjoyed
being
looked
at
and
would
not
budge
so
long
as
they
and
the
flocks
were
near
by
he
merely
stood
still
and
wanted
to
be
petted
so
ole
said
let
your
animals
out
lisbeth
and
start
ours
on
the
path
peter
then
we
shall
see
a
grazing
contest
lisbeth
opened
the
gate
and
her
animals
crowded
out
taking
their
customary
way
up
over
the
hill
peter
drove
his
own
flock
and
after
them
seeing
this
the
billy
goat
thought
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
be
jogging
along
so
he
took
a
step
forward
but
something
was
the
matter
he
looked
back
who
was
playing
tricks
and
hindering
him
he
saw
crookhorn
with
all
four
legs
planted
fast
on
the
ground
and
her
neck
stretched
out
pooh
nothing
but
that
thought
the
billy
goat
taking
a
couple
of
steps
forward
crookhorn
found
herself
obliged
to
follow
but
she
laid
her
head
back
and
struggled
then
the
billy
goat
gathered
all
his
force
set
his
horns
high
in
the
air
and
tugged
at
the
band
he
would
show
her
that
he
was
not
to
be
kept
back
by
any
such
foolery
crookhorn
again
found
herself
obliged
to
follow
but
she
resisted
and
resisted
with
all
her
might
at
length
her
fore
legs
doubled
up
under
her
and
she
sank
upon
her
knees
but
the
billy
goat
went
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
crookhorn
had
to
follow
on
her
knees
across
the
whole
flat
part
of
the
sæter
field
lisbeth
and
the
boys
shrieked
with
laughter
and
even
the
milkmaid
found
it
impossible
not
to
join
in
when
crookhorn
reached
the
beginning
of
the
hill
where
the
ground
was
more
uneven
she
thought
it
wiser
to
get
up
and
trot
along
on
her
four
feet
but
although
she
yielded
thus
far
for
the
sake
of
her
own
comfort
she
still
continued
to
struggle
against
being
forced
to
go
at
all
the
animals
took
the
customary
path
leading
farther
over
the
mountain
little
by
little
crookhorn
seemed
to
conclude
that
she
must
submit
to
the
inevitable
during
the
first
part
of
the
morning
she
was
sullen
and
contrary
merely
allowing
herself
to
be
dragged
along
but
as
the
day
wore
on
and
her
stomach
felt
empty
and
slack
she
grew
more
subdued
and
began
to
walk
quietly
forward
eating
as
she
went
like
any
other
goat
only
looking
up
once
in
a
while
when
she
heard
the
heavy
cow
bell
in
the
distance
the
fun
was
gone
when
crookhorn
took
to
behaving
well
so
the
boys
began
as
usual
to
wrestle
and
turn
somersaults
and
this
they
kept
up
until
it
was
nearly
time
to
go
home
for
their
nooning
then
ole
said
now
let
us
slip
her
loose
on
trial
i
think
she
must
be
cured
by
this
time
yes
the
others
agreed
to
that
so
they
called
to
the
billy
goat
coaxingly
he
came
jogging
along
with
his
big
horns
straight
up
and
crookhorn
trailing
after
him
ole
first
set
the
billy
goat
free
and
then
kneeling
down
before
crookhorn
he
took
hold
of
her
beard
crookhorn
pawed
with
her
feet
as
goats
do
when
they
want
to
get
rid
of
this
hold
but
ole
would
not
let
go
he
wished
to
give
her
a
few
admonitions
first
now
that
she
had
found
her
master
he
told
her
she
need
no
longer
imagine
that
she
was
a
cow
hereafter
she
was
to
behave
like
other
goats
or
she
would
have
him
to
deal
with
and
at
this
he
gave
her
beard
a
wag
as
if
to
add
force
to
his
words
that
hurt
crookhorn
and
she
made
a
bound
straight
at
him
and
sent
him
rolling
backward
then
passing
directly
over
him
with
the
willow
band
trailing
behind
her
she
set
out
on
a
trot
across
the
marsh
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
of
the
cow
bell
had
come
ole
scrambled
up
again
stamped
the
ground
with
rage
and
started
after
her
lisbeth
and
peter
were
already
on
the
way
they
shouted
and
screamed
as
they
ran
and
threatened
crookhorn
with
all
sorts
of
punishments
if
she
did
not
stop
but
crookhorn
acted
as
if
she
did
not
understand
she
ran
and
they
after
her
the
boys
became
more
and
more
angry
it
had
never
happened
before
that
they
had
been
unable
to
capture
a
goat
and
besides
each
boy
was
eager
to
get
ahead
of
the
other
so
they
ran
faster
and
faster
although
lisbeth
longfrock
was
especially
with
her
shoes
on
she
lagged
behind
it
was
like
wading
in
deep
water
to
try
to
run
in
that
long
frock
of
hers
which
in
the
hasty
start
of
the
morning
she
had
forgotten
to
tuck
up
in
her
belt
as
usual
lisbeth
ordinary
shoes
were
clumsy
wooden
ones
soon
she
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
the
boys
as
they
disappeared
over
a
hill
on
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
peter
was
ahead
she
believed
he
really
was
the
faster
runner
of
the
two
but
she
herself
was
only
in
the
middle
of
the
marsh
so
she
stopped
certainly
the
best
thing
that
she
could
do
was
to
go
back
and
get
the
animals
together
otherwise
all
three
flocks
were
likely
to
stray
away
she
turned
back
recrossed
the
marsh
and
had
climbed
the
hill
a
little
way
when
she
heard
a
rumbling
and
thudding
noise
which
grew
constantly
louder
and
louder
while
the
ground
seemed
to
roll
in
waves
under
her
feet
what
could
it
be
around
the
foot
of
the
hill
came
a
big
herd
of
horses
oh
what
a
big
herd
there
were
horses
old
and
young
and
foals
running
beside
their
mothers
horses
brown
black
and
white
and
all
of
them
were
so
bright
and
shiny
and
fat
and
skittish
they
trotted
and
ran
with
heads
tossing
those
ahead
being
passed
by
others
then
those
behind
getting
ahead
again
making
a
noise
almost
like
the
booming
of
thunder
horses
as
well
as
other
animals
are
sent
up
on
the
mountains
to
graze
during
the
summer
they
roam
about
at
will
and
sometimes
go
home
of
their
own
accord
at
the
end
of
the
season
if
no
one
has
been
sent
to
fetch
them
lisbeth
stood
still
and
watched
them
half
afraid
she
had
never
seen
so
big
a
herd
before
they
noticed
her
too
but
they
did
not
run
at
her
at
all
only
two
or
three
stopped
pricked
up
their
ears
and
gazed
at
her
trying
to
make
out
what
kind
of
little
creature
she
could
be
then
they
ran
on
again
and
in
an
instant
the
whole
herd
had
gone
past
lisbeth
could
only
hear
the
thunder
of
their
hoofs
as
they
galloped
into
the
path
leading
to
the
sæter
but
her
animals
and
the
boys
flocks
naturally
the
horses
had
frightened
them
lisbeth
could
see
no
trace
of
them
anywhere
she
ran
from
hill
to
hill
stopping
to
listen
and
then
running
again
it
was
all
of
no
use
she
could
not
find
them
the
only
wise
course
for
her
was
to
go
back
to
the
sæter
this
was
the
first
and
only
time
that
lisbeth
longfrock
went
home
without
taking
her
animals
with
her
but
when
she
reached
the
sæter
there
lay
the
whole
flock
peacefully
within
the
fold
chewing
the
cud
they
had
gone
home
of
their
own
accord
the
horses
that
had
given
lisbeth
such
a
fright
were
there
also
walking
about
and
licking
up
the
salt
which
the
milkmaid
had
strewn
for
them
in
the
afternoon
the
milkmaids
from
the
other
sæters
came
to
inquire
after
the
boys
for
their
goats
had
also
come
home
of
themselves
long
before
the
usual
time
it
was
not
until
much
later
that
ole
and
peter
arrived
dragging
crookhorn
between
them
when
the
milkmaids
laughed
at
them
the
boys
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
chagrined
that
they
had
let
their
flocks
stray
away
could
not
be
denied
but
no
one
could
say
that
they
had
come
home
without
any
animal
at
all
although
two
big
boys
seem
a
rather
liberal
number
to
be
in
charge
of
a
single
goat
however
large
that
goat
might
be
things
had
gone
wrong
for
that
day
ole
acknowledged
but
crookhorn
was
not
to
think
that
she
had
seen
the
end
of
the
struggle
they
would
take
her
with
them
again
the
next
day
she
should
get
her
deserts
but
it
turned
out
otherwise
crookhorn
knew
better
than
to
let
such
a
thing
happen
when
they
took
off
the
willow
band
she
stood
still
awhile
with
her
neck
stretched
up
looking
at
the
horses
which
were
at
that
moment
going
out
of
the
inclosure
suddenly
she
kicked
up
her
hind
legs
in
real
horse
fashion
and
then
away
she
went
after
the
herd
as
fast
as
she
could
go
the
milkmaids
as
well
as
the
boys
could
do
nothing
but
stand
and
gape
when
they
saw
her
join
the
horses
probably
she
imagines
now
that
she
is
a
horse
thought
they
for
a
while
they
stood
in
silence
watching
the
receding
herd
then
ole
said
in
his
dry
fashion
if
there
had
been
any
elephants
here
it
would
have
been
just
like
crookhorn
to
imagine
herself
an
elephant
chapter
vii
home
from
the
sæter
summer
with
its
light
nights
and
brilliant
days
comes
rapidly
to
full
power
on
the
mountains
in
norway
the
season
is
brief
but
intense
it
begins
with
a
creeping
of
light
green
over
the
gentle
slopes
and
unending
marshes
and
a
trickling
of
light
green
down
around
each
or
little
mound
of
earth
covered
with
moss
and
tiny
berry
plants
ptarmigans
roam
about
in
solitary
pairs
murmuring
when
any
one
comes
too
near
their
nests
gnats
and
horseflies
buzz
through
the
air
and
cows
with
tails
set
straight
up
scamper
friskily
about
trying
to
escape
the
irritating
stings
over
everything
lies
a
thick
warm
haze
hindering
a
free
outlook
but
soon
come
the
blueberries
the
marsh
wool
or
cotton
grass
and
later
the
cloudberries
and
on
some
fine
day
when
the
mother
ptarmigans
go
out
to
walk
peeping
sounds
are
heard
around
them
here
there
and
everywhere
the
mother
birds
scold
more
than
ever
now
that
their
young
ones
are
whirling
like
so
many
feathery
balls
a
yard
or
more
upward
and
two
or
three
yards
forward
and
then
tumbling
down
into
the
heather
again
head
foremost
by
this
time
the
cows
roam
about
quietly
and
meditatively
over
the
mountain
seeking
the
juiciest
herbage
to
nibble
the
warm
haze
melts
away
and
the
air
becomes
so
sparklingly
clear
that
mountain
peaks
miles
distant
are
as
delicately
and
sharply
outlined
as
the
nearest
little
mound
then
the
cloudberry
blossoms
fall
and
soon
the
marshes
grow
yellow
and
red
the
tiny
blossoms
of
the
heather
color
all
the
knolls
and
rocky
places
the
greenness
vanishes
and
over
the
patches
of
white
reindeer
moss
which
shine
out
like
snow
here
and
there
on
the
mountain
comes
a
blush
of
red
and
a
tinge
of
brown
autumn
is
now
drawing
near
much
of
the
time
the
sun
shines
brightly
and
when
it
does
how
glorious
to
be
the
herder
of
a
flock
but
there
come
days
also
when
the
fog
spreads
itself
like
a
close
gray
blanket
under
which
the
ground
with
its
mounds
and
bushes
and
heather
creeps
stealthily
disappearing
a
few
yards
away
and
out
of
the
fog
comes
a
fine
rain
which
deposits
itself
in
tiny
gray
beads
on
every
blade
and
every
pine
needle
so
that
wherever
any
one
goes
there
is
a
little
sprinkling
of
water
in
such
weather
it
is
far
from
pleasant
to
be
in
charge
of
a
flock
if
the
animals
move
forward
quietly
the
herder
must
seek
shelter
under
every
bush
with
a
piece
of
sacking
over
his
shoulders
to
shield
him
from
the
wet
but
it
is
far
more
likely
that
he
will
be
obliged
to
run
about
with
the
water
squeezing
in
and
out
of
his
shoes
trying
to
keep
track
of
his
animals
for
in
weather
like
this
the
mushrooms
spring
up
plentifully
and
the
animals
scatter
eagerly
in
all
directions
to
find
them
scorning
other
food
when
these
may
be
obtained
sometimes
when
the
herder
is
speeding
along
the
edge
of
the
marsh
a
pair
of
large
powerful
cranes
who
are
on
their
journey
south
will
loom
suddenly
before
him
out
of
the
fog
this
startles
him
greatly
for
the
cranes
seem
to
the
herder
much
larger
than
they
really
are
they
look
like
a
couple
of
great
sheep
with
wings
on
later
in
the
season
comes
a
morning
when
all
is
glistening
white
a
little
snow
has
fallen
during
the
night
not
enough
to
last
however
it
melts
away
as
the
day
goes
on
but
after
this
the
animals
no
longer
like
to
go
up
on
the
higher
parts
of
the
mountain
the
cows
stand
lowing
at
the
gate
of
the
sæter
inclosure
they
know
that
sooner
or
later
they
will
be
allowed
to
slip
in
there
to
enjoy
the
last
of
the
mountain
good
grazing
the
goats
look
inquiringly
backward
as
they
are
let
out
of
the
fold
summer
is
over
every
one
longs
to
go
down
again
to
the
home
farm
at
last
a
day
comes
when
the
gate
is
opened
and
the
cows
rush
into
the
sæter
inclosure
they
know
now
that
they
will
not
have
to
go
up
on
the
bare
mountain
again
this
year
then
the
farm
hands
come
up
with
pack
horses
and
other
horses
that
have
been
running
wild
on
the
mountain
all
summer
are
found
and
taken
home
the
packs
are
tied
up
there
is
a
great
washing
a
clearing
away
of
rubbish
and
putting
things
in
order
for
the
next
summer
and
at
last
day
the
day
of
returning
to
the
home
farm
arrives
on
bufar
day
lisbeth
longfrock
stood
up
on
the
ridge
of
the
roof
taking
a
final
look
at
the
surrounding
scene
she
was
all
ready
for
the
journey
her
lunch
bag
was
on
her
back
her
hat
on
her
head
and
the
goat
horn
which
peter
had
given
her
hung
on
a
string
around
her
neck
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
stout
stick
within
the
sæter
inclosure
the
cows
and
smaller
animals
were
roving
back
and
forth
from
fence
to
fence
impatiently
they
knew
that
bufar
day
had
come
for
along
the
wall
of
the
sæter
hut
in
a
row
stood
the
horses
packs
filled
with
butter
tubs
cheese
tubs
and
cheese
boxes
and
tied
to
the
fence
were
the
horses
themselves
all
of
these
had
pack
saddles
on
except
the
military
horse
which
stood
foremost
among
them
bearing
a
woman
saddle
the
farm
hands
stood
outside
too
smoking
their
pipes
they
were
all
ready
and
were
only
waiting
for
the
milkmaid
who
was
inside
the
hut
making
the
last
batch
of
cheese
from
the
morning
milk
which
she
could
not
allow
to
be
wasted
while
lisbeth
was
standing
on
the
ridge
of
the
cow
house
ole
and
peter
came
bobbing
along
past
the
fence
of
the
fold
they
were
not
so
boisterous
as
usual
and
stopped
at
the
gate
looking
at
lisbeth
without
saying
a
word
at
first
then
peter
asked
are
you
going
back
to
the
farm
lisbeth
yes
i
am
all
ready
with
one
impulse
lisbeth
and
the
boys
gazed
over
the
familiar
expanse
the
mountain
begins
to
look
barren
now
said
peter
but
i
shall
be
here
a
week
longer
so
long
as
that
said
lisbeth
and
you
ole
i
am
going
day
after
all
three
were
silent
again
for
a
while
then
lisbeth
said
i
suppose
i
must
go
with
the
others
now
they
surely
must
be
ready
she
descended
from
the
roof
and
went
over
to
where
the
boys
were
the
conversation
came
to
a
standstill
again
they
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
finally
peter
spoke
are
you
coming
again
next
summer
lisbeth
yes
if
kjersti
hoel
is
pleased
with
me
but
that
can
hardly
be
expected
since
i
am
going
home
without
crookhorn
it
would
take
a
horse
trainer
to
look
after
her
said
ole
again
there
was
silence
then
ole
said
we
did
not
go
up
to
glory
peak
this
summer
to
see
the
spot
the
king
once
visited
no
we
did
we
two
boys
are
coming
here
again
next
summer
both
of
us
perhaps
we
can
go
to
glory
peak
after
all
then
even
if
it
is
so
far
away
yes
we
can
said
ole
and
i
can
tell
you
a
good
deal
about
the
king
visit
for
my
father
went
with
him
and
drove
drove
the
king
carriage
no
not
the
king
the
county
magistrate
my
father
went
with
him
too
said
peter
and
drove
so
i
can
tell
about
it
as
well
as
you
yes
but
whose
carriage
did
he
drive
a
homely
old
woman
but
that
homely
old
woman
was
next
in
rank
to
the
queen
she
was
the
one
who
went
off
to
walk
with
the
queen
at
the
foot
of
glory
peak
just
then
came
a
call
for
lisbeth
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
stretched
out
her
little
hand
and
said
may
you
both
fare
well
thanks
for
this
summer
thanks
to
you
for
the
same
said
ole
we
are
to
meet
again
then
next
summer
yes
may
you
fare
well
said
peter
he
stood
holding
her
hand
awhile
then
thinking
he
ought
to
say
something
more
he
added
i
will
greet
jacob
from
you
lisbeth
after
that
the
boys
vanished
along
the
fence
as
noiselessly
as
they
had
come
inside
the
sæter
inclosure
the
farm
hands
were
putting
the
packs
on
the
horses
and
the
military
horse
had
been
led
to
the
gate
lisbeth
ran
into
the
inclosure
drove
her
animals
together
and
counted
them
certainly
for
the
tenth
time
that
day
soon
everything
stood
ready
for
the
homeward
march
the
milkmaid
appeared
in
the
doorway
clad
in
her
sunday
best
as
on
the
day
she
came
she
closed
the
sæter
door
with
a
bang
turned
the
large
key
solemnly
in
the
lock
took
it
out
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
that
key
she
would
not
intrust
to
any
one
else
she
wanted
to
deliver
it
to
kjersti
hoel
with
her
own
hand
after
trying
the
door
vigorously
to
be
sure
that
it
was
securely
locked
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
in
to
assure
herself
that
everything
was
in
order
and
the
fire
entirely
out
then
going
over
to
the
military
horse
she
climbed
into
the
saddle
one
of
the
farm
hands
opened
the
gate
for
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
queen
and
out
she
rode
after
her
followed
the
pack
horses
one
by
one
and
the
cows
in
the
same
order
as
when
they
came
up
the
bell
cow
brindle
and
the
whole
long
line
behind
the
cows
came
the
smaller
animals
and
last
of
all
lisbeth
longfrock
with
a
stick
in
her
hand
her
hat
on
her
head
and
her
lunch
bag
on
her
back
lisbeth
turned
and
looked
at
the
scene
she
was
leaving
there
lay
the
sæter
desolate
now
the
mountain
too
appeared
lonely
and
forsaken
of
course
she
like
all
the
others
had
longed
for
home
during
these
last
days
but
it
was
strange
after
all
for
her
to
be
going
away
from
everything
up
here
a
little
of
the
same
feeling
she
had
had
when
leaving
peerout
castle
crept
over
her
how
singular
that
she
should
happen
to
recall
that
sad
time
just
at
this
moment
she
had
not
thought
of
it
at
all
since
coming
up
on
the
mountain
not
once
during
the
whole
long
summer
nor
would
she
think
of
it
now
there
were
other
and
happier
things
to
remember
god
be
praised
all
had
gone
well
at
the
sæter
and
the
whole
procession
was
on
its
way
home
she
was
taking
her
animals
safely
back
all
except
crookhorn
of
her
she
had
seen
nothing
since
that
day
when
the
boys
had
tried
to
tame
her
but
she
had
heard
that
far
off
on
the
mountain
a
big
goat
went
about
with
a
herd
of
horses
all
day
long
the
great
procession
went
on
its
way
over
the
mountain
in
steady
plodding
fashion
the
animals
were
fatter
and
heavier
than
in
the
spring
they
trod
the
hills
with
a
brisker
and
firmer
step
and
none
showed
any
sign
of
being
tired
or
lagging
behind
the
milkmaid
was
and
plump
butterpack
she
was
always
called
in
the
autumn
as
she
and
lisbeth
looked
at
the
procession
one
from
the
front
and
the
other
from
the
rear
they
agreed
in
thinking
that
the
animals
as
well
as
the
butter
and
cheese
were
such
as
they
need
not
be
ashamed
to
take
home
to
kjersti
hoel
evening
was
drawing
near
when
suddenly
the
road
pitched
down
over
the
edge
of
the
mountain
the
valley
began
to
open
before
them
and
they
could
even
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
slope
on
the
other
side
every
one
looked
over
there
but
all
that
could
be
seen
as
yet
was
a
strip
along
the
uppermost
edge
the
only
one
to
distinguish
a
house
upon
the
strip
was
lisbeth
longfrock
away
up
and
off
to
one
side
she
saw
the
setting
sun
glittering
on
a
little
pane
of
glass
in
a
low
gray
hut
that
hut
was
peerout
castle
then
all
at
once
they
came
out
upon
the
open
mountain
side
and
the
whole
valley
lay
before
them
broad
and
peaceful
with
its
yellow
fields
and
stacks
of
grain
its
green
spaces
and
its
slope
of
birch
trees
flaming
in
yellow
with
here
and
there
a
red
mountain
ash
among
them
and
over
across
they
spied
hoel
large
substantial
and
well
cared
for
with
its
broad
shining
windows
and
its
general
air
of
comfort
smoke
was
issuing
from
its
chimney
such
an
inviting
welcoming
smoke
kjersti
had
probably
hung
the
coffee
kettle
over
the
fire
already
so
as
to
receive
them
in
a
suitable
manner
the
whole
procession
now
began
to
show
more
life
every
member
of
it
knew
that
kjersti
hoel
stood
over
there
in
the
window
watching
the
long
line
as
it
curved
down
the
open
slope
all
moved
forward
more
quickly
the
horses
hurried
ahead
the
cows
began
to
trot
the
bell
cow
sending
out
an
eager
across
the
valley
the
bells
jingled
merrily
and
lisbeth
longfrock
trilled
a
vigorous
call
through
her
little
goat
horn
they
wanted
every
one
to
hear
that
the
great
company
of
animals
belonging
to
hoel
farm
was
now
coming
back
again
thus
they
hastened
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
then
up
the
opposite
side
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
actually
at
home
kjersti
hoel
herself
stood
at
the
door
and
opened
it
for
them
the
cows
recognized
her
and
each
one
of
them
as
they
went
by
her
in
turn
received
a
word
or
a
pat
on
the
head
after
which
proud
and
satisfied
they
went
to
their
separate
stalls
not
a
single
cow
making
a
mistake
they
went
swiftly
too
for
they
knew
that
there
was
something
good
in
the
mangers
to
welcome
them
and
they
needed
something
surely
for
there
had
not
been
time
to
eat
anything
along
the
road
that
day
when
the
milkmaid
had
dismounted
from
her
horse
kjersti
took
her
hand
and
said
welcome
home
then
kjersti
went
over
to
the
door
of
the
sheep
barn
opened
that
also
and
counted
the
goats
and
sheep
as
they
went
in
and
when
lisbeth
longfrock
came
following
in
their
wake
kjersti
took
her
hand
also
and
said
welcome
home
but
faltered
lisbeth
i
have
not
brought
crookhorn
back
with
me
no
i
see
that
you
have
not
and
it
is
a
good
thing
now
we
shall
be
rid
of
her
capers
for
a
while
you
have
been
a
faithful
and
capable
little
worker
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
and
how
you
have
grown
why
your
long
frock
is
far
above
your
toes
now
then
the
milkmaid
and
lisbeth
fastened
the
cows
in
their
stalls
while
kjersti
went
to
watch
the
unloading
of
the
packs
and
to
look
at
the
tubs
and
boxes
containing
the
butter
and
cheese
that
had
been
made
at
the
sæter
after
that
kjersti
came
to
them
again
and
asked
them
to
please
walk
in
exactly
as
if
they
were
grand
strangers
and
when
they
had
gone
into
the
house
they
were
invited
into
kjersti
own
sitting
room
both
lisbeth
and
the
milkmaid
here
the
table
was
set
with
a
welcoming
meal
and
oh
how
delicious
the
food
smelled
there
were
large
hot
pancakes
as
thin
as
paper
and
pease
bread
and
hot
new
potatoes
the
finest
feast
you
can
give
to
people
just
home
from
a
sæter
and
kjersti
herself
poured
coffee
for
them
and
begged
them
to
help
themselves
then
they
had
to
give
an
account
of
everything
that
had
happened
on
the
mountain
to
tell
about
the
cows
which
of
them
had
given
the
most
milk
and
which
of
them
had
stopped
giving
about
the
sheep
goats
and
pigs
and
about
the
butter
and
cheese
that
had
been
made
and
then
kjersti
praised
her
two
servants
for
their
faithfulness
and
industry
and
the
trio
rejoiced
together
over
the
success
of
the
summer
that
evening
when
lisbeth
longfrock
again
lay
stretched
out
on
her
little
bed
in
her
room
under
the
hall
stairs
and
thought
back
over
the
summer
and
about
the
mountain
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
had
a
glorious
time
as
delightful
as
could
be
thought
of
but
all
the
same
it
was
pleasant
to
come
home
again
too
especially
when
one
was
welcomed
by
such
an
unusually
fine
woman
as
kjersti
hoel
autumn
was
passing
away
the
leaves
had
fallen
and
the
trees
spread
out
naked
branches
into
the
cold
air
in
the
fields
where
grain
had
grown
stood
only
the
poles
now
bare
and
slanting
on
which
the
crops
had
been
stacked
the
verdure
of
the
meadows
was
changed
to
yellowish
brown
there
was
no
more
food
for
the
animals
out
of
doors
so
slaughtering
day
had
come
that
is
the
end
of
the
season
for
the
young
herder
for
on
that
day
he
gives
up
his
responsibility
thenceforward
he
is
no
longer
a
person
with
a
special
duty
he
must
be
at
every
one
beck
and
call
and
when
winter
comes
with
its
long
evenings
when
the
wood
fire
gleams
out
over
the
huge
kitchen
from
the
great
open
fireplace
while
wool
is
being
carded
and
the
spinning
wheel
whirs
and
the
farm
hands
make
brooms
out
of
twigs
and
whittle
thole
pins
and
ax
handles
then
must
the
herder
sit
by
the
pile
of
twigs
and
logs
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
and
feed
the
fire
so
that
the
rest
can
see
to
work
while
he
studies
his
lessons
by
the
pile
of
wood
in
kjersti
hoel
big
kitchen
lisbeth
longfrock
had
her
place
on
the
long
winter
evenings
she
studied
and
listened
and
heard
so
many
curious
things
talked
about
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
evenings
were
too
short
and
the
days
too
few
in
spite
of
the
long
dark
norwegian
winter
before
she
knew
it
spring
had
come
again
and
when
she
looked
down
at
her
long
frock
she
found
that
the
hem
reached
no
farther
than
the
tops
of
her
ankles
chapter
viii
on
glory
peak
it
was
again
high
summer
and
the
sun
shone
bright
on
all
the
mountain
tops
when
one
morning
an
call
played
on
three
goat
horns
rang
suddenly
out
from
the
inclosure
belonging
to
hoel
sæter
one
call
was
thin
and
fine
the
other
two
were
heavier
that
triple
signal
meant
forward
march
lisbeth
longfrock
ole
and
peter
were
going
to
take
their
trip
to
glory
peak
to
see
the
spot
that
had
been
visited
by
the
king
the
boys
now
owned
goat
horns
to
blow
on
and
they
were
good
ones
too
for
lisbeth
longfrock
had
kept
her
word
about
crookhorn
horns
and
had
given
one
to
each
boy
after
crookhorn
running
off
with
the
herd
of
horses
things
had
not
gone
any
better
with
that
goat
when
she
finally
came
home
late
in
the
autumn
with
the
last
of
the
horses
she
was
so
conceited
that
there
was
no
getting
her
to
live
in
the
barn
with
the
other
goats
they
had
to
put
her
in
the
cow
house
but
not
even
the
cow
house
was
good
enough
for
her
after
her
summer
experiences
every
time
she
got
an
opportunity
out
she
bounded
trotting
over
to
the
door
of
the
stable
as
if
she
belonged
in
there
the
stable
boy
insisted
that
he
had
even
heard
her
neigh
one
day
when
the
men
were
feeding
the
horses
they
saw
her
dash
in
and
with
her
usual
air
attempt
to
squeeze
her
way
into
the
stall
of
the
military
horse
but
that
she
should
not
have
done
it
was
dark
and
the
military
horse
failed
to
see
that
it
was
only
crookhorn
at
his
heels
so
up
went
his
hind
legs
and
out
went
a
kick
that
landed
plump
on
crookhorn
cranium
and
sent
her
flying
against
the
stable
wall
that
was
the
last
of
crookhorn
it
can
not
be
said
that
any
one
except
perhaps
lisbeth
longfrock
sorrowed
particularly
over
her
but
lisbeth
could
not
help
remembering
that
crookhorn
had
given
them
milk
for
their
coffee
that
winter
up
at
peerout
castle
at
any
rate
if
not
much
sorrowed
for
the
queer
ambitious
creature
was
held
in
honorable
esteem
after
her
death
such
horns
as
hers
ole
had
never
seen
not
only
were
they
extremely
large
but
they
gave
out
a
peculiarly
fine
sound
any
one
would
know
at
once
that
they
were
not
the
horns
of
an
ordinary
goat
there
had
always
been
something
about
crookhorn
that
no
one
understood
ole
said
yes
peter
had
noticed
that
too
afterward
when
he
had
thought
a
little
more
on
the
subject
he
said
he
believed
that
horses
horns
would
have
exactly
the
same
sound
as
those
of
this
remarkable
goat
if
there
were
any
horses
with
horns
on
the
day
of
the
visit
to
glory
peak
the
goat
horns
as
musical
instruments
were
being
used
that
day
for
the
first
time
in
fact
the
trip
had
been
put
off
until
they
were
ready
but
new
goat
horns
were
not
the
only
things
the
travelers
were
provided
with
all
three
wore
their
best
clothes
and
each
carried
a
lunch
bag
full
of
food
on
his
back
and
a
stout
stick
in
his
hand
the
trip
was
so
long
that
it
would
take
a
whole
day
once
more
they
blew
their
horns
all
three
together
the
animals
looked
up
in
surprise
at
the
unusual
volume
of
sound
and
the
milkmaid
came
to
the
door
with
a
smiling
face
then
off
the
party
started
the
flocks
were
mingled
together
and
driven
straight
ahead
no
time
for
them
to
graze
by
the
wayside
with
glory
peak
lying
so
far
away
blue
against
the
sky
this
excursion
was
a
much
longer
one
than
lisbeth
had
ever
before
taken
and
even
ole
and
peter
had
been
to
glory
peak
but
once
it
was
drawing
on
toward
dinner
time
when
they
came
to
the
last
gentle
ascent
leading
to
the
top
of
glory
peak
there
the
juniper
bushes
and
old
woman
switches
dwarf
birch
grew
so
high
that
the
animals
were
quite
lost
to
sight
among
them
lisbeth
and
the
boys
could
only
see
the
course
of
their
charges
by
a
wavelike
movement
that
passed
over
the
tops
of
the
bushes
and
by
the
sticking
up
of
a
pair
of
horns
here
and
there
ole
thought
that
this
was
a
good
place
to
leave
the
flocks
for
a
time
while
they
themselves
went
on
ahead
the
animals
were
so
tired
and
hungry
that
they
would
stay
there
quietly
for
an
hour
or
so
then
when
rested
they
would
be
sure
to
follow
to
the
peak
for
a
goat
was
never
satisfied
until
it
had
mounted
to
the
highest
possible
point
where
it
could
look
about
in
all
directions
ole
plan
was
assented
to
and
it
proved
to
be
a
good
one
ole
led
lisbeth
and
peter
around
a
curve
toward
the
north
he
wanted
to
show
them
exactly
where
the
king
and
queen
came
up
on
the
day
of
their
visit
to
be
sure
they
were
not
really
king
and
queen
that
day
but
they
were
on
the
very
point
of
being
they
were
crown
prince
and
crown
princess
they
had
left
their
horses
down
on
the
mountain
side
where
the
road
grew
too
steep
for
driving
and
had
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
oh
what
a
large
company
they
had
with
them
the
county
magistrate
the
district
judge
and
officers
so
richly
dressed
that
they
could
scarcely
move
seven
or
eight
of
the
principal
farmers
of
the
district
were
also
in
the
company
and
first
among
these
were
nordrum
jacob
master
and
the
master
of
hoel
farm
who
was
then
living
these
two
wore
queer
coats
all
around
over
the
whole
mountain
top
were
crowds
of
other
people
gazing
at
the
lively
scene
the
king
looked
wonderfully
fine
did
he
asked
lisbeth
no
the
county
magistrate
looked
much
finer
and
so
did
the
officers
and
even
the
people
who
waited
upon
them
but
it
could
easily
be
seen
that
he
was
the
king
for
he
was
a
head
taller
than
any
of
the
others
the
king
must
be
tremendously
strong
said
peter
strong
of
course
he
is
and
he
must
have
use
for
every
bit
of
his
strength
too
for
he
has
to
govern
all
the
others
was
the
queen
also
very
large
asked
lisbeth
no
she
was
not
much
larger
than
an
ordinary
woman
she
was
unusually
earnest
and
father
said
there
was
not
so
much
fuss
and
feathers
with
her
as
with
the
other
women
folk
no
said
peter
the
old
frump
that
my
father
drove
laughed
even
at
the
magistrate
and
found
fault
because
his
hands
were
too
big
humph
said
ole
that
a
joke
as
if
a
fellow
should
not
have
big
fists
anyhow
i
do
see
how
she
could
have
seen
them
for
the
magistrate
wore
his
white
gloves
although
it
was
high
summer
ole
resumed
the
part
of
showman
next
they
came
up
over
this
way
the
whole
company
close
by
that
very
stone
there
and
then
the
king
ran
on
ahead
of
them
he
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
reach
the
top
as
one
might
know
and
now
i
will
show
you
exactly
what
he
did
follow
me
i
will
be
the
king
and
you
lisbeth
may
be
the
queen
come
along
ole
walked
hastily
over
the
last
spur
of
the
ground
the
others
following
then
running
the
last
few
steps
they
found
themselves
suddenly
on
the
very
top
of
the
mountain
ole
threw
out
his
hand
and
stood
a
long
time
in
silence
the
others
stood
still
also
involuntarily
impressed
by
the
wonderful
sight
here
and
there
over
the
endless
expanse
of
mountain
shone
glistening
lakes
and
mountain
pools
and
away
off
in
the
distance
rose
peaks
on
every
open
slope
lay
green
sæters
and
toward
the
south
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
were
beautiful
farming
districts
and
ridges
ole
in
his
character
of
king
threw
out
his
hand
again
this
is
the
most
beautiful
spot
i
have
ever
seen
he
cried
then
after
a
short
pause
come
sophie
and
see
ole
took
lisbeth
hand
and
drew
her
forward
yes
assented
peter
that
is
exactly
the
way
the
king
did
i
have
heard
about
it
too
of
course
it
was
said
ole
do
you
think
i
know
what
else
did
he
do
asked
lisbeth
the
king
and
queen
then
went
around
and
spoke
to
all
the
other
people
who
began
to
take
out
long
spyglasses
and
gaze
in
all
directions
and
ask
the
name
of
everything
the
county
magistrate
as
the
highest
of
the
local
officials
stood
near
the
king
and
queen
and
pointed
things
out
to
them
that
group
of
distant
white
peaks
said
the
magistrate
there
to
the
north
is
although
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can
distinguish
it
and
that
little
black
thing
farthest
away
ole
pointed
as
the
magistrate
had
done
the
highest
peak
in
norway
the
mountain
referred
to
is
galdhoepiggen
after
a
while
the
company
turned
around
facing
the
south
when
they
saw
the
view
in
that
direction
with
the
great
shining
lake
lying
so
far
away
down
there
and
the
forests
stretching
farther
and
farther
in
the
distance
even
the
king
himself
was
astonished
he
thought
that
the
forests
must
reach
almost
to
sweden
he
had
never
seen
so
vast
an
extent
of
forest
at
one
view
king
though
he
was
when
they
had
finished
looking
at
the
surrounding
landscape
nordrum
went
to
that
patch
of
reindeer
moss
over
there
and
gathered
a
whole
handful
of
it
a
good
many
of
the
people
wondered
of
course
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
he
went
over
to
the
king
showed
it
to
him
and
then
said
you
like
to
see
the
moss
that
we
mixed
with
birch
bark
to
make
bread
during
the
war
the
king
took
a
piece
and
chewed
it
there
is
bird
lime
in
it
he
said
nobody
else
had
moved
or
spoken
since
nordrum
picked
the
moss
they
were
so
surprised
at
last
father
heard
one
of
the
officers
say
is
astonishing
how
tactless
these
farmers
can
be
what
is
asked
lisbeth
oh
i
do
know
but
no
doubt
it
is
something
pleasant
for
the
king
clapped
nordrum
on
the
shoulder
and
said
my
good
man
we
can
all
thank
god
that
there
are
happier
days
in
norway
now
was
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
i
showed
you
the
moss
said
nordrum
then
they
took
the
king
to
the
great
heap
of
stones
that
was
piled
up
as
a
memorial
of
his
visit
and
asked
him
to
scratch
his
name
upon
the
stone
slab
beside
it
and
so
he
did
which
stands
for
oscar
and
sophia
and
then
the
number
of
the
year
too
see
here
it
is
it
was
all
cut
into
the
slab
afterwards
exactly
as
the
king
himself
had
scratched
it
the
three
looked
at
the
letters
yes
indeed
that
was
beautiful
writing
almost
like
print
how
remarkably
well
the
king
must
be
able
to
write
on
paper
when
he
could
write
like
that
on
stone
just
then
the
animals
came
crowding
up
over
the
edge
of
the
mountain
top
they
also
went
to
the
pile
of
stones
and
the
big
flat
stone
like
a
table
that
stood
beside
it
they
began
to
lie
down
for
now
after
eating
they
wanted
to
rest
what
else
did
the
king
and
the
others
do
asked
lisbeth
there
was
much
more
oh
yes
after
the
king
had
finished
writing
he
seemed
to
think
that
they
needed
something
to
eat
so
he
began
singing
to
the
magistrate
a
line
from
an
old
song
that
they
all
knew
the
king
had
a
good
voice
and
it
rang
out
with
jolly
zest
oh
have
you
a
drop
in
your
bottle
then
they
laughed
and
came
forward
with
a
basket
and
set
the
table
on
the
stone
here
and
they
had
something
to
drink
and
some
little
cakes
and
after
that
they
went
away
again
and
now
concluded
ole
i
think
that
we
also
need
something
to
eat
let
us
sit
here
at
the
king
table
and
have
our
lunch
too
they
took
their
lunch
bags
from
their
backs
and
sat
down
on
the
big
thick
stone
table
while
the
animals
lay
around
them
chewing
the
cud
when
the
bags
were
opened
many
good
things
came
out
there
was
butter
and
pork
and
pease
bread
and
in
lisbeth
cream
waffles
besides
in
each
bag
there
was
also
a
bottle
of
milk
except
in
ole
he
had
forgotten
his
but
that
did
not
matter
for
the
others
had
plenty
they
shared
their
food
with
each
other
and
when
ole
wanted
milk
he
merely
sang
oh
have
you
a
drop
in
your
bottle
and
so
he
got
rather
more
than
his
share
after
all
they
did
not
talk
much
at
the
beginning
of
the
meal
for
it
was
so
good
to
get
a
chance
to
eat
but
when
they
had
eaten
quite
a
while
and
their
jaws
began
to
work
more
slowly
peter
said
as
if
he
had
been
pondering
upon
it
i
wonder
what
the
king
has
to
eat
for
every
day
i
mean
porridge
all
day
long
said
ole
with
conviction
cream
that
has
been
allowed
to
stand
until
it
has
attained
a
jellylike
consistency
loppered
milk
is
sometimes
called
bonnyclabber
yes
but
when
he
wants
a
little
solid
food
once
in
a
while
asked
lisbeth
peter
had
just
put
a
very
delicious
piece
of
pork
on
some
pease
bread
he
looked
at
it
with
real
enjoyment
before
eating
it
i
am
sure
that
he
has
pork
and
pease
bread
said
he
lisbeth
took
the
last
waffle
and
bit
a
piece
off
then
she
said
yes
but
the
queen
she
certainly
does
not
eat
anything
but
cream
waffles
while
they
sat
there
on
the
stone
eating
and
talking
they
saw
a
figure
far
off
on
the
mountain
it
was
coming
in
the
direction
of
glory
peak
so
unusual
is
it
to
meet
another
person
up
on
the
mountain
that
it
gives
one
a
strange
feeling
when
it
happens
soon
they
could
think
of
nothing
except
this
stranger
it
must
be
a
man
trying
to
find
his
horses
said
ole
yes
it
must
be
surely
said
peter
but
what
farmer
could
be
sending
up
for
his
horses
now
let
me
see
it
must
be
nordrum
yes
that
is
true
they
have
only
old
blakken
at
home
now
and
they
will
have
to
begin
their
haymaking
soon
a
pet
name
for
the
norwegian
horses
yes
but
this
man
is
going
on
a
chase
the
nordrum
mare
is
over
on
the
other
side
of
our
sæter
i
saw
her
a
fortnight
ago
if
we
set
him
right
he
can
find
her
yes
easily
they
sat
still
and
watched
for
they
knew
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
the
figure
could
reach
them
it
is
so
strange
to
watch
any
one
coming
toward
you
on
the
mountain
he
walks
and
walks
and
it
can
be
seen
from
his
motions
that
he
is
walking
quickly
too
but
he
does
not
appear
to
be
getting
the
least
bit
nearer
he
continues
to
seem
small
and
far
away
and
to
increase
very
slowly
in
size
because
the
distances
from
point
to
point
are
so
great
the
animals
had
risen
and
had
begun
to
descend
the
peak
in
the
direction
of
the
sæter
but
they
concluded
to
lie
down
again
and
await
the
stranger
approach
at
last
he
reached
them
they
had
guessed
aright
he
was
walking
about
trying
to
find
the
nordrum
horses
the
boys
told
him
what
they
knew
and
said
that
although
he
could
not
get
them
that
day
he
could
the
next
day
surely
when
the
question
of
the
horses
was
settled
the
man
turned
to
lisbeth
is
it
you
who
are
called
lisbeth
longfrock
yes
answered
lisbeth
they
do
call
me
that
then
i
bring
you
a
greeting
from
jacob
your
brother
i
have
a
letter
with
me
from
him
he
wants
me
to
bring
him
an
answer
but
there
is
no
hurry
about
it
until
i
shall
spend
the
night
at
hoel
sæter
whether
i
find
the
horses
or
not
but
now
i
must
look
around
a
little
before
evening
comes
on
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
horses
are
not
on
this
side
of
the
sæter
so
off
he
went
lisbeth
was
still
sitting
on
the
king
table
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
received
a
letter
indeed
even
ole
and
peter
had
never
received
any
they
were
entirely
overwhelmed
with
respectful
surprise
and
took
their
stand
at
a
suitable
distance
on
the
outside
of
the
letter
stood
to
the
highly
respected
maiden
lisbeth
longfrock
at
hoel
sæter
on
the
west
mountain
at
convenience
by
messenger
post
free
an
expression
from
the
latin
often
used
in
norwegian
correspondence
it
meant
in
a
general
way
pardon
any
error
in
the
address
lisbeth
broke
the
seal
solemnly
and
opened
the
letter
then
she
read
half
aloud
nordrum
sæter
of
this
month
to
the
maiden
lisbeth
longfrock
sister
since
time
and
opportunity
permit
i
now
take
my
pen
in
hand
to
write
to
you
and
tell
you
that
i
have
nothing
to
write
about
except
that
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
last
saw
you
but
i
have
a
spare
day
due
to
me
from
hans
i
took
care
of
his
animals
for
him
when
he
went
to
his
mother
burial
it
was
really
two
days
but
i
only
reckoned
it
as
one
because
it
was
his
mother
and
now
i
will
take
that
day
from
him
on
the
next
sunday
of
this
month
in
case
you
have
a
day
due
to
you
from
peter
or
ole
i
write
to
ask
if
you
can
not
take
it
from
them
but
if
you
have
not
you
can
take
a
day
all
the
same
because
i
am
stronger
but
i
did
not
mean
anything
by
it
when
i
gave
peter
a
thrashing
last
winter
so
i
wanted
to
write
to
you
and
ask
if
we
could
not
meet
at
peerout
castle
for
i
have
not
been
there
since
you
are
requested
to
come
to
the
meeting
in
good
season
bring
something
to
eat
with
you
with
much
regard
respectfully
jacob
nordrum
esq
please
answer
that
evening
lisbeth
longfrock
sat
with
her
tongue
thrust
into
one
corner
of
her
mouth
and
wrote
her
response
hoel
sæter
of
this
month
to
bachelor
jacob
nordrum
brother
i
will
now
write
a
few
words
to
you
and
thank
you
for
your
welcome
letter
which
i
have
duly
received
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
are
in
good
health
the
same
can
be
said
of
me
except
for
toothache
but
i
will
gladly
come
and
the
milkmaid
says
i
may
be
away
over
night
because
it
is
too
far
and
so
ole
and
peter
can
each
have
a
day
from
me
for
i
have
not
had
any
day
from
them
they
wrestle
almost
all
the
time
but
peter
is
nearly
as
strong
i
must
now
close
my
poor
letter
to
you
with
many
greetings
from
them
but
first
and
foremost
are
you
greeted
by
me
your
affectionate
sister
lisbeth
longfrock
excuse

this
letter
dear
chapter
ix
the
visit
to
peerout
castle
late
on
saturday
evening
lisbeth
longfrock
went
jogging
slowly
up
over
the
hilly
road
to
hoel
farm
the
milkmaid
had
given
her
leave
to
go
to
the
farm
and
to
stay
away
until
monday
evening
she
had
risen
early
that
day
for
she
would
not
think
of
such
a
thing
as
leaving
the
sæter
before
she
had
done
her
morning
chores
and
milked
the
goats
and
let
out
the
cows
and
she
had
had
to
do
this
very
early
not
only
because
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
but
also
because
she
knew
that
ole
would
not
oversleep
himself
after
having
insisted
so
strongly
that
he
should
take
care
of
her
flock
the
first
day
she
had
barely
finished
when
ole
came
peter
was
not
with
him
but
she
had
had
a
talk
with
peter
the
evening
before
and
he
was
quite
as
well
pleased
to
take
her
flock
on
sunday
by
himself
and
then
on
monday
he
and
ole
could
watch
all
the
flocks
together
ole
had
been
very
modest
and
ceremonious
with
lisbeth
as
he
bade
her
he
had
shaken
hands
and
asked
her
to
greet
jacob
from
him
and
to
say
that
he
ole
hoegseth
would
not
keep
close
account
of
these
days
lisbeth
was
taking
since
jacob
really
needed
to
speak
with
his
sister
he
did
not
know
of
course
that
peter
had
said
the
very
same
thing
the
evening
before
and
then
she
had
given
her
animals
over
to
ole
care
and
had
begun
her
long
walk
down
the
mountain
she
walked
and
she
walked
hour
after
hour
she
had
now
gone
over
this
sæter
road
several
times
but
had
never
before
noticed
that
it
was
so
long
as
it
seemed
she
rested
by
a
brook
took
out
her
lunch
ate
it
and
drank
some
water
with
it
and
then
set
out
again
in
order
to
forget
how
slowly
time
was
passing
she
began
to
count
her
steps
first
by
tens
and
then
by
hundreds
and
each
time
she
had
finished
counting
she
looked
back
to
see
how
far
she
had
walked
but
this
did
not
avail
in
the
least
so
she
made
up
her
mind
to
count
to
a
thousand
when
she
had
counted
almost
up
to
a
thousand
she
could
not
remember
whether
it
was
eight
or
nine
hundred
she
had
had
last
so
she
counted
four
hundred
more
in
order
to
be
altogether
certain
that
she
had
counted
enough
but
even
that
did
not
make
the
time
pass
any
more
quickly
and
she
did
not
reach
the
point
where
she
could
look
down
into
the
valley
until
the
sun
was
setting
the
shadow
had
begun
to
creep
up
on
the
opposite
side
above
the
dark
shadow
line
the
slope
was
still
bathed
in
the
rosy
evening
sunlight
but
the
shadow
steadily
ate
its
way
upward
then
lisbeth
forgot
to
count
her
steps
any
more
what
fun
it
would
be
to
try
to
reach
the
sunshine
again
before
the
shadow
had
passed
hoel
which
lay
shining
so
brightly
up
there
she
went
down
the
long
slope
on
a
run
but
run
as
fast
as
she
might
it
took
time
and
when
she
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
started
up
the
hilly
road
on
the
other
side
the
sun
had
gone
down
she
could
only
catch
its
last
gleam
through
the
tops
of
the
spruce
trees
and
a
last
tiny
reflection
as
it
left
the
window
of
peerout
castle
she
stopped
to
get
her
breath
after
running
it
was
so
still
and
warm
and
close
down
there
in
the
valley
so
different
from
what
it
had
been
up
on
the
mountain
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
sent
out
a
deep
breath
the
moment
the
sun
went
down
a
strange
heavy
fragrance
that
made
her
all
at
once
feel
anxious
and
downhearted
just
as
if
she
had
done
something
wrong
which
she
could
not
remember
then
it
came
into
her
mind
that
she
ought
to
have
sent
word
to
kjersti
hoel
that
she
was
coming
people
in
the
valley
were
always
afraid
that
something
was
the
matter
when
a
person
came
from
the
sæter
unexpectedly
and
it
would
be
too
shameful
for
any
one
to
give
kjersti
hoel
a
fright
that
was
the
reason
she
was
now
jogging
so
slowly
up
over
the
hilly
road
leading
to
hoel
farm
she
was
in
hopes
that
some
one
would
catch
sight
of
her
or
that
at
least
bearhunter
would
give
warning
of
her
approach
for
then
they
would
see
that
she
was
not
coming
in
haste
and
that
she
therefore
could
not
be
bringing
any
bad
news
but
no
one
caught
sight
of
her
and
no
one
was
stirring
on
the
farm
so
she
would
have
to
go
right
in
after
all
yes
kjersti
hoel
was
really
startled
when
she
saw
her
lisbeth
had
no
time
to
offer
a
greeting
before
kjersti
said
what
in
the
world
is
this
a
mountain
bird
that
has
taken
flight
there
is
nothing
the
matter
at
the
sæter
is
there
lisbeth
made
haste
to
answer
oh
no
indeed
i
was
to
greet
you
from
the
milkmaid
and
say
that
you
must
not
be
frightened
at
seeing
me
for
everything
is
going
very
well
with
both
man
and
beast
i
have
only
come
down
to
make
a
visit
and
meet
jacob
my
brother
god
be
praised
said
kjersti
and
now
you
are
heartily
welcome
at
these
words
all
lisbeth
downheartedness
vanished
and
she
felt
only
how
festive
and
cozy
it
was
to
be
at
home
again
and
kjersti
was
in
the
best
of
humors
she
gave
lisbeth
something
good
to
eat
and
treated
her
with
as
much
ceremony
as
if
she
had
been
the
milkmaid
herself
when
the
time
came
for
lisbeth
to
go
to
bed
kjersti
went
with
her
all
the
way
to
the
little
sleeping
room
under
the
hall
stairs
which
looked
just
as
neat
and
orderly
as
when
she
had
left
it
and
kjersti
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
asked
after
every
single
one
of
the
animals
she
remembered
them
all
and
lisbeth
told
about
everything
there
was
only
one
provoking
thing
that
she
shrank
from
confessing
it
might
as
well
be
acknowledged
first
as
last
however
for
it
was
sure
to
come
out
sometime
and
that
was
her
mistake
in
naming
one
of
the
calves
she
had
called
it
young
moolley
but
the
name
had
proved
not
at
all
suitable
for
the
calf
horns
had
begun
to
grow
although
lisbeth
had
done
her
best
to
prevent
it
by
strewing
salt
upon
them
see
note
on
page
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
lisbeth
thought
it
certainly
began
well
when
no
less
a
person
than
kjersti
hoel
herself
came
out
into
the
little
hall
room
carrying
a
big
tray
with
coffee
and
cakes
on
it
for
lisbeth
to
indulge
in
as
she
lay
in
bed
such
grandeur
as
that
lisbeth
had
never
before
experienced
she
scarcely
believed
that
such
a
thing
had
ever
happened
to
the
milkmaid
herself
and
what
was
more
when
she
hopped
into
her
long
frock
kjersti
said
that
she
must
hurry
up
and
grow
for
there
would
be
a
new
dress
for
her
as
soon
as
this
one
had
crept
up
to
her
knees
and
although
lisbeth
had
not
said
a
word
about
where
she
was
going
to
meet
jacob
it
seemed
just
as
if
kjersti
knew
that
too
for
she
made
up
a
package
with
a
remarkably
fine
lunch
in
it
and
told
lisbeth
that
she
must
treat
jacob
to
some
of
it
because
he
would
probably
have
to
go
back
to
nordrum
sæter
that
evening
and
would
not
have
time
to
come
down
to
hoel
but
after
the
lunch
was
put
up
kjersti
did
not
seem
to
see
any
necessity
for
further
haste
in
fact
she
thought
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
jacob
to
get
to
peerout
castle
very
early
because
he
would
have
to
come
all
the
way
from
nordrum
sæter
that
morning
so
finally
lisbeth
had
to
show
kjersti
her
letter
and
point
out
the
place
where
it
said
you
are
requested
to
come
to
the
meeting
in
good
season
then
of
course
kjersti
understood
that
there
was
no
time
to
spare
shortly
afterward
lisbeth
was
on
her
way
to
peerout
castle
bearhunter
following
her
up
the
road
to
where
the
slope
of
birch
trees
began
then
he
turned
around
and
jogged
home
with
the
blandest
and
prettiest
of
sunday
curls
in
his
tail
the
valley
lay
before
her
in
its
quiet
peace
no
one
was
out
on
the
road
or
in
the
fields
here
and
there
in
the
farmhouses
across
the
valley
could
be
seen
a
man
leaning
against
the
frame
of
the
doorway
bareheaded
and
in
shirt
sleeves
as
white
as
the
driven
snow
from
all
the
chimneys
smoke
was
slowly
arising
in
the
still
air
lisbeth
looked
involuntarily
up
at
peerout
castle
there
everything
appeared
gray
and
desolate
no
smoke
ascended
from
its
chimney
and
the
window
eye
that
gazed
out
over
the
valley
looked
as
if
it
was
blind
for
the
sunlight
did
not
shine
upon
it
now
and
that
brought
to
mind
a
blind
person
whom
lisbeth
had
once
seen
and
whose
strange
empty
eyes
made
her
shiver
she
felt
just
the
same
now
and
her
pace
slackened
she
did
not
wish
to
get
to
the
house
before
jacob
did
when
she
finally
reached
peerout
castle
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
the
pine
branches
that
had
been
nailed
to
the
gateposts
the
last
time
she
was
there
they
stood
in
their
places
still
but
they
were
dry
and
the
pine
needles
had
fallen
off
she
glanced
hastily
at
the
door
of
the
house
yes
the
pine
trees
stood
there
too
just
the
same
but
a
fresher
twig
had
been
stuck
in
the
doorlatch
some
one
had
evidently
been
there
since
that
last
day
the
path
that
led
from
the
gate
to
the
door
and
from
there
over
to
the
cow
house
had
vanished
grass
covered
it
the
door
had
fallen
off
and
around
the
doorposts
had
grown
up
tall
stinging
nettles
no
trace
was
to
be
seen
of
the
foot
of
man
or
beast
lisbeth
had
rejoiced
at
the
idea
of
coming
back
to
her
old
home
it
had
never
entered
her
mind
that
peerout
castle
could
be
anything
but
the
pleasantest
place
in
the
whole
world
to
come
to
now
on
the
contrary
she
felt
all
at
once
very
very
lonely
more
lonely
than
when
on
the
mountain
or
in
the
forest
she
felt
like
one
who
afraid
of
the
dark
is
obliged
to
walk
in
it
as
if
every
step
must
be
taken
warily
that
no
creaking
be
heard
without
realizing
it
she
veered
away
from
the
castle
and
the
cow
house
feeling
that
she
would
rather
go
over
to
the
big
stone
by
the
brook
where
she
and
jacob
used
to
have
their
playthings
perhaps
it
was
not
so
desolate
there
when
she
came
to
the
heather
ridge
she
saw
jacob
already
sitting
on
the
stone
at
the
sight
of
him
lisbeth
felt
as
if
there
was
life
again
in
all
the
desolation
she
was
so
happy
that
she
was
about
to
run
toward
him
but
then
she
remembered
that
such
behavior
would
not
be
suitable
at
a
ceremonious
meeting
like
this
and
that
really
it
was
so
long
a
time
since
she
had
seen
jacob
that
he
was
almost
a
stranger
to
her
when
he
saw
her
he
jumped
down
from
the
stone
and
began
to
brush
his
gray
breeches
with
his
hands
and
to
set
his
cap
straight
he
wore
a
cap
with
a
visor
now
and
not
a
straw
hat
like
hers
both
of
them
were
as
embarrassed
as
if
they
were
entire
strangers
to
each
other
and
they
could
not
look
each
other
in
the
eye
while
shaking
hands
he
made
a
heavy
bob
with
his
head
while
she
courtesied
so
low
that
her
long
frock
drooped
down
to
the
ground
after
that
each
dropped
the
hand
and
they
remained
standing
a
long
time
looking
around
it
was
not
easy
to
find
something
to
say
although
both
had
fancied
that
they
had
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
at
last
jacob
thought
of
something
he
looked
about
for
quite
a
while
longer
and
then
said
as
if
he
had
weighed
the
matter
deliberately
and
thoroughly
it
is
delightful
weather
yes
really
delightful
if
it
holds
out
a
fortnight
longer
it
will
not
be
bad
weather
for
haying
no
it
will
not
be
at
all
bad
but
we
can
scarcely
expect
that
oh
no
scarcely
then
there
was
silence
again
for
not
much
more
could
be
said
on
that
subject
lisbeth
stole
a
look
at
jacob
she
thought
of
saying
something
about
his
having
grown
so
large
but
then
again
it
did
not
seem
to
her
quite
proper
for
her
to
speak
first
he
being
the
elder
the
package
of
food
caught
her
eye
she
could
certainly
begin
to
speak
about
that
kjersti
hoel
sent
you
her
greetings
and
bade
me
ask
if
you
would
not
try
to
put
up
with
the
lunch
she
has
sent
yes
thank
you
but
i
have
some
with
me
too
you
must
be
hungry
after
your
long
walk
yes
i
ca
say
that
i
not
then
we
will
set
the
table
here
on
the
stone
little
by
little
lisbeth
set
out
on
the
stone
all
the
good
things
which
kjersti
had
put
in
the
package
and
then
she
said
as
she
had
heard
was
the
custom
when
one
entertained
strangers
be
so
good
as
to
draw
up
your
chair
jacob
and
jacob
hesitated
also
according
to
custom
and
said
oh
thanks
but
you
should
not
put
yourself
to
any
trouble
on
my
account
they
sat
down
ceremonious
manners
were
kept
up
during
the
first
part
of
the
meal
and
lisbeth
did
not
forget
to
say
please
whenever
it
was
proper
but
when
jacob
had
eaten
one
of
kjersti
pancakes
a
large
very
thin
kind
spread
with
fresh
butter
or
sweetmeats
and
was
just
beginning
on
the
second
he
forgot
that
he
was
at
a
party
so
to
speak
and
said
quite
naturally
and
with
conviction
that
was
a
remarkably
good
pancake
yes
of
course
it
is
from
hoel
at
that
it
was
as
if
they
suddenly
knew
each
other
again
as
if
it
had
been
only
yesterday
that
they
had
kneeled
on
the
bench
under
the
window
and
looked
over
the
valley
and
made
up
their
minds
where
they
would
like
best
to
live
when
they
went
out
to
service
as
if
they
had
never
been
parted
from
each
other
and
an
instant
after
they
were
in
eager
dispute
about
which
was
the
better
place
to
live
at
nordrum
or
hoel
agree
upon
that
question
they
could
not
but
when
jacob
appetite
had
been
more
than
satisfied
he
finally
admitted
that
they
were
both
fine
places
each
one
in
its
own
way
and
that
at
any
rate
those
two
were
the
best
in
the
whole
valley
and
now
there
was
no
end
to
all
they
had
to
talk
over
together
and
to
tell
each
other
jacob
told
about
nordrum
and
the
nordrum
sæter
and
the
goats
there
and
lisbeth
told
about
ole
and
peter
and
gave
jacob
their
greetings
she
had
much
to
tell
about
them
both
but
jacob
thought
it
was
queer
that
she
had
more
to
say
about
ole
than
about
peter
for
while
ole
was
a
fellow
it
could
not
be
denied
that
he
was
a
bit
of
a
boaster
then
they
talked
about
their
future
jacob
was
going
to
stay
at
nordrum
farm
until
he
was
grown
up
and
perhaps
longer
nordrum
had
said
that
when
jacob
was
a
grown
man
and
married
he
could
take
peerout
castle
with
the
right
of
buying
it
as
soon
as
he
was
able
but
jacob
thought
that
very
likely
nordrum
meant
it
only
as
a
joke
and
anyway
it
was
a
little
early
for
him
to
be
thinking
about
marriage
nordrum
was
getting
on
in
years
however
he
would
be
sure
to
need
a
head
man
about
the
place
by
that
time
lisbeth
said
that
she
was
going
to
stay
at
hoel
she
was
as
well
off
there
as
she
could
expect
to
be
for
kjersti
was
exceedingly
kind
to
her
lisbeth
did
not
say
anything
about
her
ambition
to
become
a
milkmaid
indeed
that
goal
was
so
far
off
that
she
did
not
dare
to
set
her
heart
upon
reaching
it
when
they
had
talked
thus
freely
for
a
while
they
began
to
look
around
and
call
to
mind
all
the
plays
they
used
to
play
and
all
the
places
they
used
to
frequent
there
right
by
the
castle
itself
they
had
had
their
cow
house
with
its
animals
why
yonder
lay
the
big
bull
even
now
and
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
heather
ridge
had
been
their
sæter
where
they
had
driven
their
animals
many
times
during
the
summer
and
there
on
the
hill
jacob
had
had
his
sawmill
that
lisbeth
was
never
to
touch
and
farther
down
she
had
had
her
dairy
where
he
came
and
bought
cheese
in
exchange
for
planks
made
out
of
carrots
that
he
had
sliced
in
his
sawmill
not
a
stone
or
a
mound
could
be
seen
the
whole
way
up
to
the
stony
raspberry
patches
on
big
hammer
mountain
that
did
not
have
some
memory
connected
with
it
the
brother
and
sister
now
felt
themselves
much
older
than
when
they
had
lived
at
peerout
castle
lisbeth
thought
that
jacob
had
grown
to
be
very
large
and
he
secretly
thought
the
same
about
her
it
was
therefore
like
holding
a
sort
of
festival
for
them
to
be
visiting
the
scenes
together
and
talking
of
their
former
life
as
of
something
long
gone
by
saying
to
each
other
now
and
then
do
you
remember
what
is
talked
of
in
that
way
assumes
unwonted
proportions
and
appears
to
be
without
flaw
thus
they
went
about
the
whole
day
they
had
even
been
close
up
to
big
hammer
itself
and
it
was
already
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
again
drew
near
peerout
castle
they
did
not
seem
to
be
in
any
haste
to
reach
it
they
lingered
by
brook
and
stone
to
say
do
you
remember
often
both
at
once
and
about
the
same
thing
they
chased
each
other
in
aimless
fashion
their
chief
idea
seemed
to
be
to
think
continually
of
something
new
to
do
so
that
there
should
come
no
silent
pause
and
so
that
the
time
of
getting
back
to
the
castle
should
be
put
off
as
long
as
possible
neither
of
them
had
yet
mentioned
a
single
memory
connected
with
the
castle
itself
or
with
the
cow
house
they
had
not
visited
either
of
these
places
yet
and
they
had
avoided
all
mention
of
their
mother
but
now
they
knew
that
the
time
had
come
when
these
sad
things
could
be
avoided
no
longer
they
dragged
themselves
slowly
down
over
the
last
ridge
talking
more
rapidly
and
nervously
and
with
loud
and
forced
laughter
then
suddenly
their
laughter
ceased
as
if
it
had
been
cut
straight
across
they
had
come
out
on
the
ridge
just
back
of
the
cow
house
they
became
very
very
quiet
and
stood
awhile
with
heads
cast
down
then
they
turned
toward
each
other
and
their
eyes
met
it
did
not
seem
at
all
as
if
they
had
just
been
laughing
their
eyes
were
so
strangely
big
and
bright
while
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
there
came
suddenly
the
klunk
of
a
bell
over
from
svehaugen
at
that
jacob
shook
his
head
as
if
shaking
himself
free
from
something
and
said
in
a
most
indifferent
manner
do
you
think
that
is
the
svehaugen
bell
we
hear
over
there
lisbeth
answered
as
unconcernedly
as
she
could
yes
it
is
i
remember
it
what
cow
do
you
believe
they
have
at
svehaugen
now
for
their
home
milking
we
could
go
over
there
and
see
whether
it
is
bliros
that
was
the
first
time
since
her
mother
death
that
lisbeth
had
spoken
bliros
name
aloud
but
to
do
that
was
easier
than
to
name
her
mother
it
was
not
long
before
lisbeth
and
jacob
were
on
their
way
over
to
svehaugen
they
had
gone
round
the
castle
and
the
cow
house
without
going
very
near
them
it
was
not
worth
while
to
tread
down
the
grass
jacob
said
as
they
had
expected
they
found
bliros
at
svehaugen
she
was
standing
close
by
the
gate
and
they
really
thought
that
she
knew
lisbeth
again
they
petted
her
and
talked
to
her
and
gave
her
waffles
and
pancakes
it
was
just
as
if
they
wanted
to
make
amends
for
not
having
had
courage
to
stir
up
the
memories
connected
with
their
old
home
itself
jacob
heart
was
so
touched
at
the
last
that
he
promised
to
buy
bliros
back
and
give
her
to
lisbeth
as
soon
as
he
was
grown
up
at
that
lisbeth
could
contain
herself
no
longer
she
put
her
arms
around
bliros
neck
looked
at
her
a
long
time
and
said
do
you
believe
jacob
that
bliros
remembers
mother
and
then
she
began
to
cry
that
question
came
upon
jacob
so
unexpectedly
that
at
first
he
could
say
nothing
after
a
moment
struggle
he
too
was
crying
but
he
managed
to
declare
with
decision
yes
if
she
remembers
any
one
it
certainly
must
be
mother
chapter
x
sunday
at
the
sæter
five
summers
had
passed
away
since
lisbeth
longfrock
first
went
up
on
the
mountain
and
no
one
who
had
not
seen
her
during
those
years
could
have
guessed
that
she
had
grown
into
the
tall
girl
sitting
by
herself
one
sunday
on
the
stone
which
so
far
back
as
any
herder
could
remember
had
been
called
the
pancake
stone
and
which
lay
hidden
away
in
a
distant
and
lonely
part
of
the
mountain
she
had
grown
so
tall
that
the
long
frock
now
used
as
a
petticoat
came
above
her
knees
and
she
no
longer
wore
the
hat
and
shoes
on
this
special
sunday
her
sunday
kerchief
was
on
her
head
and
she
sat
with
a
book
in
her
lap
for
in
the
winter
she
was
to
go
to
the
priest
to
be
prepared
for
confirmation
and
in
the
spring
she
was
to
be
confirmed
the
reading
did
not
progress
very
rapidly
the
book
had
sunk
down
into
her
lap
and
her
calm
blue
eyes
now
grown
so
womanly
and
earnest
were
roving
from
one
to
another
of
the
dear
familiar
places
about
her
her
flock
lay
quietly
around
the
stone
chewing
the
cud
indian
summer
was
near
its
close
the
sky
was
high
vaulted
and
the
air
clear
and
cool
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
all
things
were
sketched
in
sharpest
outline
hills
and
marshes
already
glowed
in
autumnal
tints
for
these
make
their
triumphal
entry
on
the
mountains
earlier
than
below
the
sun
shone
tranquilly
and
as
it
were
a
little
coolly
also
everything
was
very
still
not
even
the
sound
of
a
bell
was
heard
for
the
animals
were
taking
their
afternoon
rest
and
no
movement
was
discernible
except
far
far
away
where
lisbeth
spied
a
falcon
flapping
out
from
glory
peak
just
as
it
was
now
had
lisbeth
seen
the
mountain
at
the
close
of
each
summer
all
these
years
it
had
become
familiar
and
dear
to
her
and
she
thought
to
herself
how
unchanging
it
was
through
all
its
variableness
while
so
much
else
altered
never
to
be
the
same
again
for
much
had
changed
since
she
first
sat
on
this
same
stone
and
looked
out
over
this
same
landscape
few
of
the
animals
she
now
took
care
of
had
belonged
to
her
original
flock
the
oldest
had
gone
out
and
new
ones
had
come
in
the
unlucky
morskol
mother
moolley
was
now
a
cow
with
horns
of
more
than
usual
beauty
the
former
milkmaid
was
gone
and
another
had
taken
her
place
ole
and
peter
with
whom
lisbeth
in
earlier
years
had
tended
her
flock
almost
daily
were
her
companions
no
longer
they
had
not
been
up
at
the
sæter
since
they
were
confirmed
two
years
ago
ole
had
even
sailed
to
america
lisbeth
had
missed
the
boys
very
much
and
had
many
a
time
been
lonely
during
the
last
two
summers
for
no
new
herders
had
come
from
the
hoegseth
or
lunde
farms
at
home
too
at
the
hoel
farm
there
had
been
changes
among
the
people
and
bearhunter
had
become
blind
lisbeth
herself
no
longer
occupied
her
old
place
by
the
heap
of
firewood
in
the
great
kitchen
on
winter
evenings
but
sat
beside
kjersti
on
the
wooden
carving
bench
that
is
she
sat
there
when
she
did
not
have
to
study
her
catechism
or
learn
her
hymns
to
be
ready
for
school
the
next
day
and
now
still
further
changes
were
in
store
for
her
this
was
to
be
the
last
summer
she
would
be
sitting
up
here
tending
her
flock
what
would
come
next
kjersti
hoel
had
not
said
anything
to
her
about
the
future
perhaps
kjersti
would
not
want
her
any
longer
but
lisbeth
put
these
thoughts
aside
she
would
not
allow
her
mind
to
dwell
on
such
perplexing
subjects
when
all
was
so
delightfully
peaceful
and
beautiful
around
her
whatever
her
lot
might
be
or
wherever
she
might
go
of
one
thing
she
was
certain
she
would
never
forget
these
mountain
scenes
nor
this
stone
which
had
always
been
her
favorite
resting
place
especially
since
she
had
been
so
much
alone
and
she
gazed
around
her
again
as
her
eyes
wandered
about
she
caught
sight
of
a
man
far
off
on
the
marsh
sauntering
along
in
her
direction
stopping
once
in
a
while
and
stooping
down
apparently
to
pluck
an
occasional
cloudberry
for
they
were
now
beginning
to
ripen
this
sent
her
thoughts
into
another
channel
who
could
it
be
coming
over
the
marsh
not
a
man
looking
for
horses
for
no
one
goes
out
for
that
purpose
on
sunday
nor
a
cloudberry
picker
for
the
berries
were
not
yet
ripe
enough
to
pay
for
the
trouble
of
seeking
surely
it
was
some
one
who
had
made
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
for
pleasure
only
what
if
it
should
be
jacob
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
last
autumn
and
he
had
said
then
that
he
would
come
up
to
see
her
this
summer
nevertheless
the
young
man
did
not
look
like
jacob
and
jacob
not
being
very
well
acquainted
on
the
western
mountain
would
not
be
trying
to
find
the
pancake
stone
yet
this
person
was
steering
his
course
exactly
toward
where
she
sat
and
it
was
plain
that
he
knew
the
marsh
thoroughly
where
the
cloudberries
grew
and
where
it
was
not
so
wet
but
that
you
could
get
across
it
could
not
possibly
be
she
blushed
the
instant
she
thought
of
the
name
and
at
the
same
moment
the
stranger
disappeared
behind
a
hill
so
that
she
saw
no
more
of
him
for
the
time
involuntarily
she
tied
her
kerchief
freshly
under
her
chin
stroked
her
light
hair
under
the
edge
of
the
kerchief
and
smoothed
out
the
folds
in
her
skirt
then
sitting
with
her
back
half
turned
to
the
quarter
where
he
might
be
expected
to
appear
she
took
up
her
book
and
bent
her
head
over
it
as
if
reading
shortly
afterward
a
young
man
shot
up
over
the
hill
behind
her
he
had
on
gray
woolen
clothes
a
bought
scarf
around
his
neck
and
outside
his
trousers
he
was
not
tall
but
his
figure
was
well
knit
and
manly
in
his
youthful
face
on
which
the
merest
shadow
of
down
could
be
distinguished
was
set
a
pair
of
brown
eyes
trusting
and
trustworthy
he
stopped
a
moment
and
looked
down
at
the
open
space
where
lisbeth
sat
upon
the
stone
with
the
flock
of
animals
around
her
it
was
evident
that
he
had
a
memory
of
the
scene
that
he
had
seen
that
picture
before
lisbeth
did
not
look
up
but
she
knew
he
was
there
felt
in
her
back
so
to
speak
that
he
was
standing
there
gazing
at
her
he
smiled
and
then
swung
his
course
around
so
as
to
approach
her
from
the
side
and
so
that
the
animals
might
have
time
to
become
gently
aware
of
his
presence
and
not
scramble
up
in
a
flurry
silently
he
drew
near
to
her
until
at
last
his
shadow
fell
upon
her
book
then
she
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
at
that
both
of
them
flushed
a
little
and
he
said
hastily
good
day
lisbeth
longfrock
good
day
why
is
it
you
peter
out
for
a
walk
they
shook
hands
yes
i
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
a
look
at
the
old
places
again
and
since
jacob
was
coming
up
to
visit
you
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
him
company
is
jacob
with
you
yes
but
he
is
waiting
down
at
the
sæter
for
he
was
tired
we
were
out
early
and
tomorrow
we
are
to
take
home
a
pair
of
nags
to
hoegseth
farm
he
sent
you
his
greeting
and
will
see
you
this
evening
were
you
sure
that
you
could
find
me
oh
yes
i
knew
just
about
where
you
would
be
in
such
weather
and
of
course
it
is
more
fun
for
me
to
ramble
around
here
than
for
him
i
being
so
familiar
with
the
region
he
sat
down
beside
her
on
the
stone
and
gazed
slowly
around
does
it
look
natural
here
yes
everything
is
unaltered
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
i
was
here
taking
care
of
the
lunde
flocks
but
i
hardly
recognized
again
you
have
grown
so
large
do
you
think
so
yes
but
still
it
is
two
years
since
i
last
saw
you
there
was
a
short
pause
then
peter
continued
i
walked
over
sloping
marsh
by
our
bathing
pond
the
water
has
all
run
out
yes
it
has
i
wondered
if
it
would
not
be
a
good
plan
for
me
to
build
the
dam
up
again
so
that
you
could
use
the
pond
no
you
need
not
do
that
for
i
have
my
bathing
place
somewhere
else
a
place
that
no
one
knows
about
oh
have
you
yes
i
had
it
the
last
year
that
you
and
ole
were
here
too
so
it
was
there
you
used
to
be
on
the
days
that
you
kept
away
from
us
yes
sometimes
the
animals
began
to
get
up
and
stray
off
thus
attracting
attention
lisbeth
made
peter
look
at
the
older
goats
to
see
if
he
recognized
them
and
she
was
glad
to
find
that
he
did
remember
them
all
then
she
told
him
about
the
new
ones
but
soon
that
topic
was
exhausted
and
there
was
apparently
nothing
more
to
talk
about
they
still
remained
seated
on
the
stone
then
peter
said
you
have
that
hat
any
longer
have
you
lisbeth
no
it
was
worn
out
long
ago
but
what
is
it
you
have
on
this
string
he
took
hold
carefully
of
a
string
she
wore
around
her
neck
and
pulling
it
drew
out
from
her
bosom
the
little
goat
horn
he
had
given
her
i
did
not
think
you
would
have
that
horn
still
said
peter
a
deep
blush
covered
lisbeth
face
at
the
idea
of
appearing
childish
to
peter
she
hastened
to
say
oh
yes
i
carry
it
with
me
sometimes
i
have
mine
too
it
is
the
only
thing
i
have
left
from
my
herding
days
and
he
drew
one
of
crookhorn
horns
out
of
an
inner
pocket
shall
we
try
them
then
they
both
laughed
and
played
the
old
woman
with
a
stick
together
as
they
had
so
often
done
in
the
old
days
it
did
not
sound
as
if
either
of
them
had
forgotten
it
in
the
least
when
the
tune
was
finished
there
was
another
pause
at
last
lisbeth
said
i
must
look
after
the
animals
a
little
now
or
i
shall
lose
track
of
them
ca
you
let
them
go
home
alone
it
is
time
for
them
to
seek
the
fold
and
they
will
surely
find
the
way
safely
then
we
can
walk
to
the
sæter
more
at
our
leisure
yes
i
will
gladly
i
can
trust
them
to
find
their
way
home
i
am
sure
again
there
was
silence
for
a
time
then
lisbeth
rose
saying
i
think
we
must
go
now
peter
did
not
stir
he
merely
said
very
quietly
ca
you
sit
a
little
longer
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
ask
you
lisbeth
bowed
her
head
and
seated
herself
again
without
speaking
i
have
a
greeting
to
you
from
ole
i
received
a
letter
from
him
a
fortnight
ago
he
asked
me
very
particularly
to
give
you
his
greetings
thank
you
is
all
going
well
with
him
yes
it
seems
so
from
his
letter
he
has
a
good
place
and
earns
large
wages
ole
deserves
it
he
grew
to
be
a
fine
fellow
yes
he
did
he
asks
me
whether
i
will
go
to
america
in
the
spring
he
will
send
me
a
ticket
if
i
will
on
hearing
that
lisbeth
looked
up
at
peter
for
an
instant
then
drooped
her
head
again
without
saying
a
word
peter
continued
it
was
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
do
you
wish
me
to
go
a
dead
silence
ensued
during
which
peter
sat
looking
inquiringly
at
her
for
a
long
time
she
was
motionless
then
suddenly
lifting
her
head
she
fastened
her
blue
eyes
upon
him
and
said
no
i
do
wish
you
to
go
there
was
no
more
conversation
on
that
subject
and
soon
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
sæter
they
went
around
by
all
the
familiar
memorable
places
including
both
the
bathing
pond
and
pointing
stump
and
all
these
places
had
so
many
reminders
for
them
of
the
time
when
they
watched
their
flocks
together
there
that
more
than
once
they
said
how
much
they
pitied
ole
who
would
perhaps
never
be
able
to
come
to
norway
again
the
sky
arched
high
and
clear
above
them
the
mountain
stretched
beyond
them
with
its
unending
silent
wastes
and
lisbeth
and
peter
felt
strangely
buoyant
and
glad
although
they
had
made
no
agreement
they
felt
as
if
they
had
a
hidden
bond
between
them
as
if
they
two
had
a
wonderful
secret
that
no
one
not
even
jacob
could
share
chapter
xi
lisbeth
appointed
head
milkmaid
it
was
the
first
sunday
after
easter
early
in
the
morning
lisbeth
sat
by
the
small
table
in
her
little
sleeping
room
with
one
elbow
leaning
on
the
table
and
her
hand
under
her
chin
while
she
stared
down
at
a
big
black
book
which
lay
open
before
her
the
book
was
the
new
testament
and
lisbeth
lips
moved
softly
as
she
read
that
morning
for
the
first
time
in
several
years
she
had
not
gone
into
the
cow
house
kjersti
hoel
had
said
that
she
was
to
have
a
couple
of
hours
in
which
she
could
be
alone
no
one
was
to
disturb
her
she
sat
there
somewhat
stiff
and
helpless
in
a
long
black
dress
with
a
strip
of
white
in
the
neck
the
dress
seemed
to
her
rather
tight
so
tight
that
she
held
her
elbows
close
to
her
side
and
hardly
dared
to
bend
her
back
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
had
a
dress
on
her
usual
costume
being
a
jacket
and
skirt
her
light
hair
was
drawn
smoothly
back
and
twisted
into
a
knot
at
her
neck
that
was
for
the
first
time
too
she
was
a
trifle
paler
than
usual
and
her
lips
as
she
moved
them
were
dark
red
and
dewy
but
her
eyes
shone
with
peace
all
in
all
she
was
beautiful
as
she
sat
there
in
her
little
room
waiting
for
church
time
to
come
this
was
the
day
that
she
was
to
be
confirmed
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
in
stepped
kjersti
hoel
she
also
was
dressed
in
her
very
best
an
black
dress
with
a
gathered
waist
and
a
freshly
ironed
cap
with
a
frill
around
the
face
and
strings
hanging
down
in
her
hand
she
carried
the
big
psalm
book
a
handsome
one
printed
in
large
type
which
she
used
only
on
the
greatest
occasions
on
top
of
the
psalm
book
lay
a
neatly
folded
pocket
handkerchief
standing
still
for
a
moment
and
looking
earnestly
at
lisbeth
kjersti
said
do
you
think
you
are
ready
now
lisbeth
lisbeth
answered
quietly
yes
i
think
so
then
it
is
time
for
us
to
start
come
let
me
tie
your
kerchief
so
that
your
hair
will
not
get
untidy
she
tied
the
kerchief
on
lisbeth
head
and
then
they
went
slowly
out
through
the
hall
way
outside
at
the
door
stood
the
broad
wagon
with
the
military
horse
harnessed
to
it
you
may
come
and
sit
up
here
by
me
lisbeth
said
kjersti
so
they
both
got
into
the
wagon
and
drove
off
not
a
word
was
spoken
the
whole
way
as
they
drove
down
the
hill
from
the
farm
and
out
on
the
main
road
they
were
encompassed
by
all
the
effervescence
of
the
spring
its
myriads
of
sights
sounds
and
odors
the
brooks
and
rivers
rushed
tunefully
along
birds
by
the
thousands
were
singing
and
calling
insects
were
buzzing
trees
and
plants
of
many
sorts
were
pouring
their
fragrance
over
the
whole
valley
and
above
it
all
stood
the
sun
shedding
down
its
glittering
light
but
these
things
failed
to
arouse
in
lisbeth
the
feelings
they
usually
awakened
they
had
instead
the
effect
of
a
roar
and
a
disturbance
of
something
inharmonious
that
caused
her
to
quiver
with
discomfort
involuntarily
she
drew
nearer
to
kjersti
on
the
wagon
seat
she
felt
a
longing
for
one
thing
only
silence
thus
they
drove
for
a
while
along
the
sunlit
valley
road
then
suddenly
a
broad
wave
of
sound
came
rolling
toward
them
the
church
bells
were
adding
their
tones
broad
peaceful
sure
to
the
general
chorus
they
did
not
drown
the
sounds
of
the
spring
but
took
them
up
as
it
were
and
ordered
them
harmonized
them
used
them
as
a
gentle
accompaniment
so
that
the
whole
seemed
like
a
great
psalm
singing
and
organ
playing
at
the
sound
of
the
bells
there
came
to
lisbeth
a
feeling
of
peace
solemnity
and
holiness
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
she
felt
lifted
up
a
change
came
over
the
world
about
her
everything
became
lighter
loftier
as
if
prepared
for
a
sacred
festival
she
felt
a
mighty
gladness
within
her
from
that
time
on
she
had
but
a
confused
consciousness
of
what
took
place
on
arriving
at
the
church
she
thought
that
the
gathering
of
people
around
it
had
never
been
so
large
or
so
reverent
in
demeanor
and
that
the
church
had
never
looked
so
tall
and
shining
as
she
went
inside
and
walked
up
the
church
aisle
she
felt
very
erect
and
free
the
same
wonderful
light
was
within
the
church
too
and
when
she
looked
down
the
lines
of
those
who
were
to
be
confirmed
with
her
as
they
stood
with
bowed
heads
on
each
side
of
the
middle
aisle
she
thought
that
their
faces
were
strangely
radiant
when
the
priest
came
into
the
chancel
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
much
larger
than
ever
before
and
that
his
face
was
oh
so
mild
he
began
to
speak
and
though
she
did
not
really
hear
or
understand
what
he
said
she
felt
that
it
was
something
great
and
good
and
it
thrilled
her
like
music
as
soon
as
the
psalm
singing
began
she
joined
in
with
a
stronger
voice
than
usual
her
breast
swelling
involuntarily
when
it
came
her
turn
to
be
questioned
she
hardly
knew
whether
she
had
heard
what
the
priest
asked
or
not
but
she
was
sure
nevertheless
that
her
answer
which
came
forth
clear
and
firm
was
the
right
one
and
when
she
knelt
down
and
gave
the
priest
her
hand
as
the
ceremony
required
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
awkward
figures
in
the
old
altar
pictures
smiled
benignantly
upon
her
she
did
not
come
wholly
to
herself
until
the
confirmation
ceremony
was
entirely
over
and
she
had
gone
to
her
seat
beside
kjersti
hoel
in
one
of
the
church
pews
as
lisbeth
drew
near
kjersti
took
her
hand
and
said
half
aloud
may
it
bring
you
happiness
and
blessing
lisbeth
lisbeth
stood
a
moment
looked
up
at
kjersti
as
if
just
awakening
smiled
and
whispered
softly
thanks
kjersti
hoel
then
when
the
service
was
over
they
walked
out
of
church
outside
the
church
door
stood
jacob
and
peter
they
lifted
their
caps
to
kjersti
and
shook
hands
with
her
afterward
they
shook
hands
with
lisbeth
lifting
their
caps
to
her
too
which
had
not
been
their
custom
before
her
confirmation
they
also
said
to
her
may
it
bring
you
happiness
and
blessing
after
that
kjersti
and
lisbeth
walked
about
the
grassy
space
in
front
of
the
church
they
made
slow
progress
because
there
were
so
many
people
who
wanted
to
greet
the
mistress
of
hoel
and
to
ask
what
girl
it
was
that
she
had
presented
for
confirmation
on
that
day
at
last
they
reached
the
broad
wagon
to
which
the
horse
had
already
been
harnessed
and
mounting
into
it
they
set
forth
on
their
homeward
way
returning
in
silence
as
they
had
come
not
until
they
had
reached
home
did
kjersti
say
you
would
like
to
be
alone
awhile
this
afternoon
too
yes
thank
you
responded
lisbeth
in
the
afternoon
lisbeth
longfrock
again
sat
alone
in
the
little
room
in
the
hall
way
bearhunter
who
had
now
become
blind
lay
outside
her
door
whenever
he
was
not
in
the
kitchen
where
as
a
rule
he
kept
to
his
own
corner
he
lay
at
lisbeth
door
having
chosen
this
place
in
preference
to
his
old
one
on
the
flat
stone
in
front
of
the
house
to
lie
on
the
doorstep
where
so
many
went
out
and
in
and
nowadays
they
went
so
rudely
was
too
exciting
for
him
but
lisbeth
always
stepped
considerately
as
lisbeth
sat
there
in
her
room
she
was
not
reading
in
any
book
in
fact
she
was
doing
nothing
at
all
spread
out
on
the
bed
before
her
lay
her
long
frock
which
she
had
not
used
that
winter
it
looked
very
small
and
worn
when
she
had
come
into
her
room
where
the
afternoon
sun
fell
slantwise
upon
the
coverlet
of
her
bed
picturing
there
the
small
window
frame
she
had
had
a
wonderful
feeling
of
peace
and
contentment
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
not
the
least
need
of
thinking
about
serious
things
or
of
reading
either
she
felt
that
the
simplest
and
most
natural
thing
to
do
was
merely
to
busy
herself
happily
without
putting
her
thoughts
on
anything
in
particular
she
had
no
earthly
possessions
of
value
but
she
did
have
a
small
chest
which
she
had
received
in
the
second
year
of
her
stay
at
hoel
and
in
this
chest
there
was
a
tiny
side
box
and
also
a
space
in
the
lid
where
she
had
stored
away
the
little
she
owned
that
seemed
worth
keeping
she
had
pulled
the
chest
forward
and
opened
it
to
take
the
things
out
look
at
each
one
and
recall
the
memories
connected
with
them
was
very
pleasant
there
was
a
old
pocketknife
that
had
been
given
to
her
by
ole
the
first
summer
on
the
mountain
there
was
a
letter
from
ole
too
that
she
had
received
the
last
autumn
and
that
no
one
knew
about
in
it
he
had
asked
if
he
might
send
her
and
jacob
tickets
to
america
after
she
had
been
confirmed
she
had
not
answered
the
letter
yet
but
she
would
do
it
soon
now
and
thank
him
and
say
that
she
was
not
coming
for
she
knew
that
she
could
never
leave
norway
and
then
she
took
out
the
goat
horn
that
peter
had
given
her
she
was
seized
with
a
strong
desire
to
play
on
it
but
did
not
dare
to
because
it
would
sound
so
strange
in
the
house
next
to
the
place
where
the
goat
horn
had
lain
was
a
silk
neckerchief
that
peter
had
given
her
for
christmas
he
had
sent
it
by
jacob
she
herself
had
not
seen
or
spoken
with
peter
since
that
sunday
last
year
when
he
had
found
her
on
the
mountain
until
at
the
church
and
there
was
the
letter
she
had
received
from
jacob
in
regard
to
their
meeting
at
peerout
castle
it
was
the
only
letter
she
had
ever
had
from
him
jacob
was
not
one
to
write
much
but
she
had
a
few
small
gifts
that
he
had
sent
her
down
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
chest
lay
a
kerchief
that
she
had
never
taken
out
before
her
mother
kerchief
it
seemed
to
lisbeth
that
now
was
the
first
time
she
had
really
dared
to
think
about
her
mother
she
took
out
the
kerchief
and
spread
it
on
the
bed
and
when
as
she
did
so
her
eye
caught
sight
of
her
old
long
frock
hanging
on
the
wall
she
spread
that
too
on
the
bed
then
she
seated
herself
and
gazed
upon
these
simple
objects
the
time
had
arrived
when
it
was
possible
for
her
to
look
back
without
becoming
hopelessly
sorrowful
when
she
could
ponder
over
the
rich
memories
which
these
poor
relics
hid
the
memories
from
peerout
castle
not
being
the
least
precious
she
sat
nourishing
these
thoughts
a
long
time
beginning
at
the
beginning
as
far
back
as
she
could
remember
and
going
forward
to
this
very
sunday
the
memories
came
easily
and
in
regular
succession
and
all
of
them
were
good
memories
everything
that
had
seemed
hard
at
the
time
either
had
been
forgotten
or
was
seen
now
in
a
softer
light
suddenly
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
before
lisbeth
had
had
time
to
conceal
the
things
or
presence
of
mind
enough
to
rise
from
her
chair
in
walked
kjersti
hoel
lisbeth
saw
that
kjersti
noticed
the
things
at
once
but
she
was
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
for
kjersti
only
smiled
kindly
and
said
i
see
that
you
are
thinking
about
your
mother
lisbeth
and
that
is
right
but
now
come
with
me
into
my
room
there
is
something
i
wish
to
talk
with
you
about
lisbeth
was
half
alarmed
at
this
for
never
before
had
kjersti
spoken
so
seriously
to
her
but
she
rose
quietly
and
did
as
she
was
bidden
kjersti
went
ahead
through
the
kitchen
and
across
to
the
door
of
her
own
room
lisbeth
following
close
behind
her
the
others
in
the
kitchen
looked
at
them
curiously
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
once
in
her
room
kjersti
took
a
seat
beside
the
table
and
asked
lisbeth
to
sit
at
the
opposite
side
then
said
kjersti
you
are
now
grown
up
lisbeth
longfrock
and
hereafter
you
will
be
free
to
decide
things
for
yourself
i
have
kept
the
last
promise
i
made
to
your
mother
and
i
can
say
that
it
has
been
only
a
pleasure
for
me
to
do
so
you
have
turned
out
well
as
may
be
expected
of
every
good
girl
if
you
do
as
well
in
the
future
i
really
believe
that
your
mother
would
be
satisfied
with
both
you
and
me
but
from
i
have
no
longer
any
right
to
decide
things
for
you
you
must
decide
for
yourself
what
you
will
do
and
what
you
think
is
right
i
will
therefore
ask
you
and
you
are
to
choose
with
entire
freedom
whether
you
wish
to
stay
here
with
me
any
longer
or
whether
now
that
you
are
to
earn
your
own
living
you
would
rather
try
something
else
i
can
add
that
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
you
stay
here
for
a
while
there
was
a
deep
silence
then
lisbeth
looked
up
with
big
tears
in
her
eyes
and
said
i
should
like
to
stay
with
you
kjersti
hoel
as
long
as
you
are
pleased
with
me
that
is
what
i
thought
and
therefore
i
have
also
thought
of
another
thing
of
course
you
are
very
young
yet
but
it
is
not
always
unwise
to
put
responsibility
on
young
shoulders
you
have
shown
yourself
so
faithful
and
capable
not
only
at
the
cow
house
but
at
the
sæter
as
well
that
i
have
no
fear
in
intrusting
both
to
your
care
if
you
wish
it
to
be
so
i
will
now
appoint
you
head
milkmaid
at
hoel
farm
