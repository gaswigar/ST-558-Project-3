scene
is
the
blue
and
white
room
in
the
house
of
the
misses
susan
and
phoebe
throssel
in
quality
street
and
in
this
little
country
town
there
is
a
satisfaction
about
living
in
quality
street
which
even
religion
can
not
give
through
the
bowed
window
at
the
back
we
have
a
glimpse
of
the
street
it
is
pleasantly
broad
and
and
is
linked
to
the
outer
world
by
one
demure
shop
whose
door
rings
a
bell
every
time
it
opens
and
shuts
thus
by
merely
peeping
every
one
in
quality
street
can
know
at
once
who
has
been
buying
a
whimsy
cake
and
usually
why
this
bell
is
the
most
familiar
sound
of
quality
street
now
and
again
ladies
pass
in
their
pattens
a
maid
perhaps
protecting
them
with
an
umbrella
for
flakes
of
snow
are
falling
discreetly
gentlemen
in
the
street
are
an
event
but
see
just
as
we
raise
the
curtain
there
goes
the
recruiting
sergeant
to
remind
us
that
we
are
in
the
period
of
the
napoleonic
wars
if
he
were
to
look
in
at
the
window
of
the
blue
and
white
room
all
the
ladies
there
assembled
would
draw
themselves
up
they
know
him
for
a
rude
fellow
who
smiles
at
the
approach
of
maiden
ladies
and
continues
to
smile
after
they
have
passed
however
he
lowers
his
head
so
that
they
shall
not
see
him
his
present
design
being
converse
with
the
misses
throssel
room
is
one
seldom
profaned
by
the
foot
of
man
and
everything
in
it
is
white
or
blue
miss
phoebe
is
not
present
but
here
are
miss
susan
miss
willoughby
and
her
sister
miss
fanny
and
miss
henrietta
turnbull
miss
susan
and
miss
willoughby
alas
already
wear
caps
but
all
the
four
are
dear
ladies
so
refined
that
we
ought
not
to
be
discussing
them
without
a
more
formal
introduction
there
seems
no
sufficient
reason
why
we
should
choose
miss
phoebe
as
our
heroine
rather
than
any
one
of
the
others
except
perhaps
that
we
like
her
name
best
but
we
gave
her
the
name
so
we
must
support
our
choice
and
say
that
she
is
slightly
the
nicest
unless
indeed
miss
susan
is
fanny
is
reading
aloud
from
a
library
book
while
the
others
sew
or
knit
they
are
making
garments
for
our
brave
soldiers
now
far
away
fighting
the
corsican
miss
fanny
and
so
the
day
passed
and
evening
came
black
mysterious
and
the
wind
moaned
unceasingly
like
a
shivering
spirit
and
the
vegetation
rustled
uneasily
as
if
something
weird
and
terrifying
were
about
to
happen
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
there
emerged
a
says
the
last
word
tremulously
but
without
looking
up
the
listeners
knit
more
the
unhappy
camilla
was
standing
lost
in
reverie
when
without
pausing
to
advertise
her
of
his
intentions
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
this
time
the
knitting
has
stopped
and
all
are
listening
as
if
slowly
he
gathered
her
in
his
arms
miss
susan
an
excited
little
miss
fanny
and
rained
hot
burning
miss
willoughby
sister
miss
fanny
eyes
mouth
miss
willoughby
stop
miss
susan
i
am
indeed
surprised
you
should
bring
such
an
amazing
indelicate
tale
from
the
library

susan

slight
i
deeply
regret
miss
willoughby
miss
fanny
quickly
to

willoughby

the
end

partiality
for

fear

the
mark
of
an
old
maid

willoughby
susan

word
miss
susan
is
what
i
am
and
you
also

defence
fanny
i
do
not
approve
of
miss
phoebe
at
all
miss
susan
mary
had
phoebe
been
dying
you
would
have
called
her
an
angel
but
that
is
ever
the
way
is
all
jealousy
to
the
bride
and
good
wishes
to
the
corpse
guests
rise
my
love
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
willoughby
with
your
permission
miss
susan
i
shall
put
on
my
pattens
miss
susan
permission
almost
haughtily
and
the
ladies
retire
to
the
bedroom
miss
fanny
behind
a
moment
to
ask
a
miss
fanny
a
bride
miss
susan
do
you
mean
that
has
declared
miss
susan
fanny
i
expect
it
hourly
miss
susan
alone
is
agitated
by
the
terrible
scene
miss
willoughby
phoebe
her
bonnet
and
we
see
at
once
that
she
really
is
the
nicest
she
is
so
flushed
with
delightful
news
that
she
almost
forgets
to
take
off
her
pattens
before
crossing
the
blue
and
white
miss
susan
you
seem
strangely
excited
phoebe
phoebe
susan
i
have
met
a
certain
individual
miss
susan
phoebe
several
times
and
her
gleaming
eyes
miss
susan
much
as
if
they
were
a
romance
from
the
my
dear
you
are
trembling
phoebe
no
oh
no
miss
susan
you
put
your
hand
to
your
heart
phoebe
did
i
miss
susan
a
my
love
has
he
offered
phoebe
oh
susan
miss
willoughby
miss
willoughby
how
do
you
do
miss
phoebe
susan
i
have
no
wish
to
alarm
you
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
there
is
a
man
in
the
house
i
suddenly
felt
it
while
putting
on
my
pattens
miss
susan
you
mean
a
follower
in
the
kitchen
courageously
rings
the
bell
but
her
voice
i
am
just
a
little
afraid
of
patty
patty
buxom
young
woman
who
loves
her
mistresses
and
smiles
at
them
and
knows
how
to
terrorise
patty
i
hope
we
may
not
hurt
your
feelings
but
patty
are
you
implicating
that
i
have
a
follower
miss
susan
oh
no
patty
patty
so
be
it
miss
susan
patty
come
back
i
told
a
falsehood
just
now
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
patty
as
well
you
might
be
phoebe
roused
that
she
would
look
heroic
if
she
did
not
spoil
the
effect
by
wagging
her
finger
patty
how
dare
you
there
is
a
man
in
the
kitchen
to
the
door
with
him
patty
a
glorious
soldier
to
be
so
treated
phoebe
the
door
patty
and
if
he
refuses
looked
miss
susan
oh
dear
phoebe
if
he
refuses
send
him
here
to
me
miss
susan
phoebe
miss
willoughby
a
soldier
i
wish
it
may
not
be
that
impertinent
recruiting
sergeant
i
passed
him
in
the
street
he
closed
one
of
his
eyes
at
me
and
then
quickly
opened
it
i
knew
what
he
meant
phoebe
he
does
not
come
miss
susan
i
think
i
hear
their
voices
in
dispute
is
listening
through
the
floor
they
all
stoop
or
go
on
their
knees
to
listen
and
when
they
are
in
this
position
recruiting
sergeant
unobserved
he
chuckles
aloud
in
a
phoebe
alone
with
sergeant
an
irish
your
servant
phoebe
sternly
on
sir
is
perplexed
as
he
seems
sergeant
sees
mud
from
his
boots
on
the
oh
oh
sergeant
i
am
wishful
to
scold
you
but
would
you
be
so
obliging
as
to
stand
on
this
paper
while
i
do
it
sergeant
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
phoebe
to
be
sergeant
have
you
killed
people
sergeant
dozens
dozens
phoebe
how
terrible
oh
sir
i
pray
every
night
that
the
lord
in
his
will
root
the
enemy
up
is
it
true
that
the
corsican
ogre
eats
babies
sergeant
i
have
spoken
with
them
as
have
seen
him
do
it
phoebe
the
man
of
sin
have
you
ever
seen
a
vivandiere
sir
i
have
sometimes
wished
there
were
vivandieres
in
the
british
army
a
moment
she
sees
herself
as
oh
sergeant
a
shudder
goes
through
me
when
i
see
you
in
the
streets
enticing
those
poor
young
men
sergeant
if
you
were
one
of
them
and
death
or
glory
was
the
call
you
would
take
the
shilling
phoebe
oh
not
for
that
sergeant
for
king
and
country

poor
young

phoebe
you

a
dear
good
girl

i

not

it
now
phoebe
what
is
it
you
have
to
tell
me
phoebe
a
low
dear
i
think
it
is
too
holy
to
speak
of
miss
susan
to
your
sister
phoebe
susan
as
you
know
i
was
sitting
with
an
unhappy
woman
whose
husband
has
fallen
in
the
war
when
i
came
out
of
the
cottage
he
was
passing
miss
susan
yes
phoebe
he
offered
me
his
escort
at
first
he
was
very
silent
as
he
has
often
been
of
late
miss
susan
know
why
phoebe
please
not
to
say
that
i
know
why
suddenly
he
stopped
and
swung
his
cane
you
know
how
gallantly
he
swings
his
cane
miss
susan
yes
indeed
phoebe
he
said
have
something
i
am
wishful
to
tell
you
miss
phoebe
perhaps
you
can
guess
what
it
is
miss
susan
go
on
phoebe
to
say
i
could
guess
sister
would
have
been
unladylike
i
said
not
to
tell
me
in
the
public
thoroughfare
to
which
he
instantly
replied
i
shall
call
and
tell
you
this
afternoon
miss
susan
phoebe
are
interrupted
by
the
entrance
patty
tea
they
see
that
she
has
brought
three
cups
and
know
that
this
is
her
impertinent
way
of
implying
that
mistresses
as
well
as
maids
may
have
a
when
she
has
gone
they
smile
at
the
daring
of
the
woman
and
sit
down
to
phoebe
susan
to
think
that
it
has
all
happened
in
a
single
year
miss
susan
such
a
genteel
competency
as
he
can
offer
such
a
desirable
establishment
phoebe
i
had
no
thought
of
that
dear
i
was
recalling
our
first
meeting
at
fotheringay
quadrille
party
miss
susan
we
had
quite
forgotten
that
our
respected
local
physician
was
growing
elderly
phoebe
until
he
said
me
to
present
my
new
partner
valentine
brown
miss
susan
phoebe
do
you
remember
how
at
the
he
facetiously
passed
the
with
nothing
in
it
phoebe
he
was
so
amusing
from
the
first
i
am
thankful
susan
that
i
too
have
a
sense
of
humour
i
am
exceedingly
funny
at
times
am
i
not
susan
miss
susan
yes
indeed
but
he
sees
humour
in
the
most
unexpected
things
i
say
something
so
ordinary
about
loving
for
instance
to
have
everything
either
blue
or
white
in
this
room
and
i
know
not
why
he
laughs
but
it
makes
me
feel
quite
witty
phoebe
little
i
hope
he
sees
nothing
odd
or
quaint
about
us
miss
susan
my
dear
i
am
sure
he
can
not
phoebe
susan
the
picnics
miss
susan
phoebe
the
day
when
he
first
drank
tea
in
this
house
phoebe
he
invited
himself
miss
susan
he
merely
laughed
when
i
said
it
would
cause
such
talk
phoebe
he
is
absolutely
fearless
susan
he
has
smoked
his
pipe
in
this
room
are
both
a
little
miss
susan
smoking
is
indeed
a
dreadful
habit
phoebe
but
there
is
something
so
dashing
about
it
miss
susan
and
now
i
am
to
be
left
alone
phoebe
no
miss
susan
my
dear
i
could
not
leave
this
room

lovely
blue
and
white
room

my
husband

make
my
house

home

have
something
distressing
to
tell
you
miss
susan
you
alarm
me
phoebe
you
know
brown
advised
us
how
to
invest
half
of
our
money

susan

know
it
gives
us
eight
per
though
why
it
should
do
so
i
can
not
understand
but
very
obliging
i
am
sure
phoebe
susan

that
money
is
lost

the
letter
several
days
ago
miss
susan

phoebe
something
burst
dear
and
then
they
absconded
miss
susan
but
brown
phoebe
i
have
not
advertised
him
of
it
yet
for
he
will
think
it
was
his
fault
but
i
shall
tell
him
miss
susan
phoebe
how
much
have
we
left
phoebe
only
sixty
pounds
a
year
so
you
see
you
must
live
with
us
dearest
miss
susan
but
brown
he
phoebe
he
is
a
man
of
means
and
if
he
is
not
proud
to
have
my
susan
i
shall
say
at
once
brown
the
door
presses
her
cheek
miss
susan
miss
susan
phoebe
i
have
a
wedding
gift
for
you
phoebe
not
yet
miss
susan
it
has
been
ready
for
a
long
time
i
began
it
when
you
were
not
ten
years
old
and
i
was
a
young
woman
i
meant
it
for
myself
phoebe
i
had
hoped
that
he
his
name
was
william
but
i
think
i
must
have
been
too
unattractive
my
love
phoebe
sweetest
dearest
miss
susan
i
always
associate
it
with
a
sprigged
poplin
i
was
wearing
that
summer
with
a
breadth
of
coloured
silk
in
it
being
a
naval
officer
but
something
happened
a
miss
cicely
pemberton
and
they
are
quite
big
boys
now
so
long
ago
phoebe
he
was
very
tall
with
brown
hair
it
was
most
foolish
of
me
but
i
was
always
so
fond
of
sewing
with
long
straight
legs
and
such
a
pleasant
expression
phoebe
susan
what
was
it
miss
susan
it
was
a
my
dear
even
plain
women
phoebe
we
ca
help
it
when
we
are
young
we
have
romantic
ideas
just
as
if
we
were
pretty
and
so
the
was
never
used
long
before
it
was
finished
i
knew
he
would
not
offer
but
i
finished
it
and
then
i
put
it
away
i
have
always
hidden
it
from
you
phoebe
but
of
late
i
have
brought
it
out
again
and
altered
it
goes
to
ottoman
and
unlocks
phoebe
susan
i
could
not
wear
it
miss
susan
the
oh
how
sweet
how
beautiful
miss
susan
you
will
wear
it
my
love
wo
you
and
the
tears
it
was
sewn
with
long
ago
will
all
turn
into
smiles
on
my
are
tearfully
happy
when
a
knock
is
heard
on
the
street
phoebe
that
knock
miss
susan
so
dashing
phoebe
so
imperious
is
suddenly
susan
i
think
he
kissed
me
once
miss
susan
you
phoebe
i
know
he
did
that
evening
a
week
ago
when
he
was
squiring
me
home
from
the
concert
it
was
raining
and
my
face
was
wet
he
said
that
was
why
he
did
it
miss
susan
because
your
face
was
wet
phoebe
it
does
not
seem
a
sufficient
excuse
now
miss
susan
o
phoebe
before
he
had
offered
phoebe
i
fear
me
it
was
most
unladylike
valentine
brown
shown
in
he
is
a
frank
genial
young
man
of
who
honestly
admires
the
ladies
though
he
is
amused
by
their
quaintness
he
is
modestly
aware
that
it
is
in
the
blue
and
white
room
alone
that
he
is
esteemed
a
brown
miss
susan
how
do
you
do
nay
miss
phoebe
though
we
have
met
already
i
insist
on
shaking
hands
with
you
again
miss
susan
always
so
dashing
valentine
and
the
ladies
exchange
delighted
valentine
miss
susan
and
my
other
friends
i
hope
i
find
them
in
health
the
spinet
seems
quite
herself
i
trust
the
ottoman
passed
a
good
night
miss
susan
we
are
all
quite
well
sir
valentine
may
i
sit
on
this
chair
miss
phoebe
i
know
miss
susan
likes
me
to
break
her
chairs
miss
susan
indeed
sir
i
do
not
phoebe
how
strange
that
he
should
think
so
phoebe
the
remark
was
humorous
was
it
not
valentine
how
you
see
through
me
miss
phoebe
sisters
again
exchange
delighted
valentine
about
to
take
a
miss
susan
oh
dear
i
feel
sure
he
is
going
to
roll
the
coverlet
into
a
ball
and
then
sit
on
it
valentine
has
been
on
the
point
of
doing
so
abstains
and
sits
valentine
so
i
am
dashing
miss
susan
am
i
dashing
miss
phoebe
phoebe
a
little
i
think
valentine
well
but
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
i
really
think
is
rather
dashing
miss
susan
her
knitting
looks
phoebe
is
preparing
to
you
are
not
going
before
you
know
what
it
is
miss
susan
i
i
indeed
to
be
sure
i
i
know
brown
phoebe
susan
miss
susan
i
mean
i
do
not
know
i
mean
i
can
guess
i
mean
phoebe
my
love
explain
goes
valentine
the
explanation
being
i
suppose
that
you
both
know
and
i
had
flattered
myself
was
such
a
secret
am
i
then
to
understand
that
you
had
foreseen
it
all
miss
phoebe
phoebe
nay
sir
you
must
not
ask
that
valentine
i
believe
in
any
case
was
you
who
first
put
it
into
my
head
phoebe
oh
i
hope
not
valentine
your
demure
eyes
flashed
so
every
time
the
war
was
mentioned
the
little
quaker
suddenly
looked
like
a
gallant
boy
in
ringlets
dread
comes
phoebe
it
is
in
her
heart
alone
it
shows
neither
in
face
nor
phoebe
brown
what
is
it
you
have
to
tell
us
valentine
that
i
have
enlisted
miss
phoebe
did
you
surmise
it
was
something
else
phoebe
you
are
going
to
the
wars
brown
is
it
a
jest
valentine
it
would
be
a
sorry
jest
i
thought
you
knew
i
concluded
that
the
recruiting
sergeant
had
talked
phoebe
the
recruiting
sergeant
i
see
valentine
these
stirring
times
miss
phoebe
he
is
but
half
a
man
who
stays
at
home
i
have
chafed
for
months
i
want
to
see
whether
i
have
any
courage
and
as
to
be
an
army
surgeon
does
not
appeal
to
me
it
was
enlist
or
remain
behind
i
found
that
there
were
five
waverers
i
asked
them
would
they
take
the
shilling
if
i
took
it
and
they
assented
miss
phoebe
it
is
not
one
man
i
give
to
the
king
but
six
phoebe
i
think
you
have
done
bravely
valentine
we
leave
shortly
for
the
petersburgh
barracks
and
i
go
to
london
tomorrow
so
this
is
phoebe
i
shall
pray
that
you
may
be
preserved
in
battle
brown
valentine
and
you
and
miss
susan
will
write
to
me
when
occasion
offers
phoebe
if
you
wish
it
valentine
with
all
the
stirring
news
of
quality
street
phoebe
it
seems
stirring
to
us
it
must
have
been
merely
laughable
to
you
who
came
here
from
a
great
city
valentine
dear
quality
street
that
thought
me
dashing
but
i
made
friends
in
it
miss
phoebe
of
two
very
sweet
ladies
phoebe
brown
i
wonder
why
you
have
been
so
kind
to
my
sister
and
me
valentine
the
kindness
was
yours
if
at
first
miss
susan
amused
me
to
see
her
on
her
knees
decorating
the
little
legs
of
the
couch
with
frills
as
if
it
were
a
child
but
it
was
her
sterling
qualities
that
impressed
me
presently
phoebe
and
did
did
i
amuse
you
also
valentine
prodigiously
miss
phoebe
those
other
ladies
they
were
always
scolding
you
your
youthfulness
shocked
them
i
believe
they
thought
you
dashing
phoebe
i
have
sometimes
feared
that
i
was
perhaps
too
dashing
valentine
at
you
delicious
miss
phoebe
you
were
too
quiet
i
felt
sorry
that
one
so
sweet
and
young
should
live
so
grey
a
life
i
wondered
whether
i
could
put
any
little
pleasures
into
it
phoebe
the
picnics
it
was
very
good
of
you
valentine
that
was
only
how
it
began
for
soon
i
knew
that
it
was
i
who
got
the
pleasures
and
you
who
gave
them
you
have
been
to
me
miss
phoebe
like
a
quiet
garden
full
of
the
flowers
that
englishmen
love
best
because
they
have
known
them
longest
the
daisy
that
stands
for
innocence
and
the
hyacinth
for
constancy
and
the
modest
violet
and
the
rose
when
i
am
far
away
i
shall
often
think
of
miss
phoebe
pretty
soul
which
is
her
garden
and
shut
my
eyes
and
walk
in
it
is
smiling
gallantly
through
her
pain
miss
susan
miss
susan
have
you
is
it
you
seem
so
calm
phoebe
phoebe
her
sister
hand
warningly
and
susan
what
brown
is
so
obliging
as
to
inform
us
of
is
not
what
we
expected
not
that
at
all
my
dear
he
is
the
gentleman
who
has
enlisted
and
he
came
to
tell
us
that
and
to
say
miss
susan
going
away
phoebe
yes
dear
valentine
am
i
not
the
ideal
recruit
a
man
without
a
wife
or
a
mother
or
a
sweetheart
miss
susan
no
sweetheart
valentine
have
you
one
for
me
miss
susan
phoebe
lest
her
sister
face
should
betray
the
susan
we
shall
have
to
tell
him
now
you
dreadful
man
you
will
laugh
and
say
it
is
just
like
quality
street
but
indeed
since
i
met
you
and
you
told
me
you
had
something
to
communicate
we
have
been
puzzling
what
it
could
be
and
we
concluded
that
you
were
going
to
be
married
valentine
ha
ha
ha
was
that
it
phoebe
so
like
women
you
know
we
thought
we
perhaps
knew
her
at
the
we
were
even
discussing
what
we
should
wear
at
the
wedding
valentine
ha
ha
i
shall
often
think
of
this
i
wonder
who
would
have
me
miss
susan
but
i
must
be
off
and
god
bless
you
both
miss
susan
you
are
going
valentine
no
more
mud
on
your
carpet
miss
susan
no
more
coverlets
rolled
into
balls
a
good
riddance
miss
phoebe
a
last
look
at
the
garden
her
hand
and
looking
into
her
phoebe
we
shall
miss
you
very
much
brown
valentine
there
is
one
little
matter
that
investment
i
advised
you
to
make
i
am
happy
it
has
turned
out
so
well
phoebe
miss
susan
is
about
to
tell
of
the
loss
of
the
it
was
good
of
you
to
take
all
that
trouble
sir
accept
our
grateful
thanks
valentine
indeed
i
am
glad
that
you
are
so
comfortably
left
i
am
your
big
brother
again
this
little
blue
and
white
room
and
its
dear
inmates
may
they
be
unchanged
when
i
come
back
miss
susan
forlornly
phoebe
smiles
phoebe
a
misunderstanding
just
a
mistake
shudders
lifts
the
and
puts
it
back
in
the
miss
susan
sobbing
into
a
do
dear
do
we
can
live
it
down
miss
susan
he
is
a
fiend
in
human
form
phoebe
nay
you
hurt
me
sister
he
is
a
brave
gentleman
miss
susan
the
money
why
did
you
not
let
me
tell
him
phoebe
so
that
he
might
offer
to
me
out
of
pity
susan
miss
susan
phoebe
how
are
we
to
live
with
the
quartern
loaf
at
one
and
tenpence
phoebe
brother
james
miss
susan
you
know
very
well
that
brother
james
will
do
nothing
for
us
phoebe
i
think
susan
we
could
keep
a
little
school
for
genteel
children
only
of
course
i
would
do
most
of
the
teaching
miss
susan
you
a
schoolmistress
phoebe
of
the
ringlets
every
one
would
laugh
phoebe
i
shall
hide
the
ringlets
away
in
a
cap
like
yours
susan
and
people
will
soon
forget
them
and
i
shall
try
to
look
staid
and
to
grow
old
quickly
it
will
not
be
so
hard
to
me
as
you
think
dear
miss
susan
there
were
other
gentlemen
who
were
attracted
by
you
phoebe
and
you
turned
from
them
phoebe
i
did
not
want
them
miss
susan
they
will
come
again
and
others
phoebe
no
dear
never
speak
of
that
to
me
any
more
i
let
him
kiss
me
miss
susan
you
could
not
prevent
him
phoebe
yes
i
could
i
know
i
could
now
i
wanted
him
to
do
it
oh
never
speak
to
me
of
others
after
that
perhaps
he
saw
i
wanted
it
and
did
it
to
please
me
but
i
meant
indeed
i
did
that
i
gave
it
to
him
with
all
my
love
sister
i
could
bear
all
the
rest
but
i
have
been
unladylike
curtain
falls
and
we
do
not
see
the
sisters
again
for
ten
of
act
act
ii
the
school
years
later
it
is
the
blue
and
white
room
still
but
many
of
miss
susan
beautiful
things
have
gone
some
of
them
never
to
return
others
are
stored
upstairs
their
place
is
taken
by
grim
scholastic
furniture
forms
a
desk
a
globe
a
blackboard
heartless
maps
it
is
here
that
miss
phoebe
keeps
school
miss
susan
teaches
in
the
room
opening
off
it
once
the
spare
bedroom
where
there
is
a
smaller
blackboard
for
easier
sums
but
no
globe
as
miss
susan
is
easily
alarmed
here
are
the
younger
pupils
unless
they
have
grown
defiant
when
they
are
promoted
to
the
blue
and
white
room
to
be
under
miss
phoebe
braver
rule
they
really
frighten
miss
phoebe
also
but
she
does
not
let
her
sister
know
is
noon
on
a
day
in
august
and
through
the
window
we
can
see
that
quality
street
is
decorated
with
flags
we
also
hear
at
times
martial
music
from
another
street
miss
phoebe
is
giving
a
dancing
lesson
to
half
a
dozen
pupils
and
is
doing
her
very
best
now
she
is
at
the
spinet
while
they
dance
and
again
she
is
showing
them
the
new
step
we
know
it
is
miss
phoebe
because
some
of
her
pretty
airs
and
graces
still
cling
to
her
in
a
forlorn
way
but
she
is
much
changed
her
curls
are
out
of
sight
under
a
cap
her
manner
is
prim
the
light
has
gone
from
her
eyes
and
buoyancy
from
her
figure
she
looks
not
ten
years
older
but
twenty
and
not
an
easy
twenty
when
the
children
are
not
looking
at
her
we
know
that
she
has
the
phoebe
is
sometimes
at
the
spinet
and
sometimes
toes
out
so
chest
out
georgy
point
your
toes
miss
beveridge
so
so
keep
in
line
and
young
ladies
remember
your
toes
georgy
his
desire
to
please
has
protruded
the
wrong
part
of
his
person
she
writes
a
c
on
his
chest
with
c
stands
for
chest
georgy
this
is
miss
susan
out
of
the
other
room
she
is
less
worn
miss
phoebe
miss
susan
so
that
the
pupils
may
not
phoebe

and
seventeen

not
have
forgotten

am
only

much
more
than
valentine

so
pityingly
at
me
because
i
have
had
to
work

get
a
husband
miss

ladylike
is
not
enough

merry
it
is
every
woman
birthright
to
be
petted
and
admired
i
wish
to
be
petted
and
admired
was
i
born
to
be
confined
within
these
four
walls

they
the
world
susan
or
is
there
anything
beyond
them

ten
years
they

seen
nothing
but
maps
and
desks
ten
years
ten
years
ago

went
to
bed
a
young
girl
and

woke
with
this
cap
on
my
head

some
other
person

always
been
so
patient
phoebe
oh
no

how
i
have
rebelled
at
times
you
would
turn
from
me
in
horror
susan
i
have
a
picture
of
myself
as
i
used
to
be
i
sometimes
look
at
it
i
sometimes
kiss
it
and
say
girl
they
have
all
forgotten
you
but
i
remember
miss
susan
i
can
not
recall
it
phoebe

locked
away
in
my
room

you
like
to
see
it
i
shall
bring
it
down
my
room
oh
susan
it
is
there
that
the
phoebe
you
think
so
patient
has
the
hardest
fight
with
herself
for
there
i
have
seemed
to
hear
and
see
the
phoebe
of
whom
this
at
is
but
an
image
in
a
distorted
glass
i
have
heard
her
singing
as
if
she
thought
she
was
still
a
girl
i
have
heard
her
weeping
perhaps
it
was
only
i
who
was
weeping
but
she
seemed
to
cry
to
me
me
out

patty
i

i

gazing
at
my
sweetheart
miss

your
sweetheart
i
did
not
know
you
had
one
patty
nor
have
i
as
yet
but
i
looks
out
and
thinks
i
to
myself
at
any
moment
he
may
turn
the
corner
i
ha
been
looking
out
at
windows
waiting
for
him
to
oblige
by
turning
the
corner
this
fifteen
years
miss
susan
fifteen
years
and
still
you
are
hopeful
patty
there
is
not
a
more
hopeful
woman
in
all
the
king
dominions
miss
susan
you
who
are
so
much
older
than
miss
phoebe
patty
yes
i
ha
the
advantage
of
her
by
ten
years
miss
susan
it
would
be
idle
to
pretend
that
you
are
specially
comely
patty
that
may
be
but
my
face
is
my
own
and
the
more
i
see
it
in
the
glass
the
more
it
pleases
me
i
never
look
at
it
but
i
say
to
myself
is
to
be
the
lucky
man
miss
susan
is
wonderful
patty
this
will
be
a
great
year
for
females
think
how
many
of
the
men
that
marched
away
strutting
to
the
wars
have
come
back
limping
who
is
to
take
off
their
wooden
legs
of
an
evening
miss
susan
you
or
me
miss
susan
patty
patty
or
miss
phoebe
the
pretty
thing
that
she
was
miss
susan
miss
susan
do
you
remember
patty
i
think
there
is
no
other
person
who
remembers
unless
it
be
the
misses
willoughby
and
miss
henrietta
patty
give
her
a
chance
and
take
her
to
the
balls
there
be
three
of
them
this
week
and
the
last
ball
will
be
the
best
for
is
to
be
at
the
barracks
and
you
will
need
a
carriage
to
take
you
there
and
there
will
be
the
packing
of
you
into
it
by
gallant
squires
and
the
unpacking
of
you
out
and
other
devilries
miss
susan
patty
patty
if
miss
phoebe
were
to
dress
young
again
and
put
candles
in
her
eyes
that
used
to
be
so
bright
and
coax
back
her
curls
phoebe
and
a
great
change
has
come
over
her

is
young
and

the
picture
of

its
box

lest
you
should
hear
her
miss
susan

old
friend

am
like
aunt
phoebe
every
one
says
so

indeed

no
compliment

a
compliment

excellent

buckland

monstrous
quick

indeed
phoebe
is
impossible
really
means
it
and
had
not
the
music
here
taken
an
unfair
advantage
of
her
it
is
certain
miss
phoebe
never
have
gone
to
the
ball
in
after
years
she
miss
susan
have
talked
together
of
the
monstrous
evening
when
she
nearly
lost
her
head
but
regained
it
before
it
could
fall
off
but
suddenly
the
music
swells
so
alluringly
that
it
is
a
thousand
fingers
beckoning
her
to
all
the
balls
she
has
missed
and
in
a
transport
she
miss
susan
the
blue
and
white
room
to
the
where
is
the
valentine
their
return
like
a
conqueror
miss
about
his
hair
return
to
trouble
him
he
is
stooping
gazing
intently
into
a
small
mirror
extracting
the
grey
hairs
one
by
one
patty
in
the
willoughby
miss
henrietta
miss
henrietta
wearing
the
new
veil
which
opens
or
closes
like
curtains
when
she
pulls
a
string
she
opens
it
now
to
see
what
he
is
doing
and
the
slight
sound
brings
him
to
his
miss
henrietta
is
but
the
new
veil
sir
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
have
already
learned
patty
may
be
sure
that
he
is
in
the
house
but
they
express
genteel
miss
fanny
mary
surely
we
are
addressing
the
gallant
captain
brown
valentine
it
is
the
misses
willoughby
and
miss
henrietta
is
indeed
a
gratification
to
renew
acquaintance
with
such
elegant
and
respectable
females
greetings
are
miss
willoughby
you
have
seen
miss
phoebe
sir
valentine
i
have
had
the
honour
miss
phoebe
i
regret
to
say
is
now
lying
down
with
the
headache
ladies
are
too
delicately
minded
to
exchange
glances
before
a
man
but
they
are
privately
of
opinion
that
this
meeting
after
ten
years
with
the
brown
miss
phoebe
they
are
in
a
twitter
of
sympathy
with
her
and
yearning
to
miss
susan
so
that
they
may
draw
from
her
an
account
of
the
exciting
you
do
not
favour
the
ball
miss
fanny
i
confess
balls
are
distasteful
to
me
miss
henrietta
be
a
mixed
assembly
i
am
credibly
informed
that
the
woollen
draper
daughter
has
obtained
a
card
valentine
good
god
is
it
possible
miss
willoughby
we
shall
probably
spend
the
evening
here
with
miss
susan
at
the
card
table
valentine
but
miss
susan
goes
with
me
to
the
ball
is
scarcely
less
exciting
to
them
than
the
overthrow
of
the
valentine
nay
i
hope
there
be
no
impropriety
miss
livvy
will
accompany
her
miss
willoughby
miss
livvy
valentine
their
charming
niece
ladies
repeat
the
word
in
a
miss
fanny
they
had
not
apprised
us
that
they
have
a
visitor
think
this
reticence
unfriendly
and
are
wondering
whether
they
ought
not
to
retire
hurt
miss
susan
in
her
bombazine
wraps
and
bonnet
she
starts
at
sight
of
them
and
has
the
bearing
of
a
guilty
miss
willoughby
we
have
but
now
been
advertised
of
your
intention
for
this
evening
susan
miss
henrietta
we
deeply
regret
our
intrusion
miss
susan
please
not
to
be
piqued
mary
was
so
sudden
miss
willoughby
i
can
not
remember
susan
that
your
estimable
brother
had
a
daughter
i
thought
all
the
three
were
sons
miss
susan
deplorable
three
sons
and
a
daughter
surely
you
remember
little
livvy
mary
miss
willoughby
no
susan
i
do
not
miss
susan
i
i
must
go
i
hear
livvy
calling
miss
fanny
i
hear
nothing
but
the
band
we
are
not
to
see
your
niece
miss
susan
another
time
pray
rest
a
little
before
you
depart
mary
i
i
phoebe
livvy
the
headache
before
she
can
go
another
lady
enters
valentine
ah
here
is
miss
livvy
true
culprit
is
more
cunning
miss
susan
before
they
can
see
her
she
quickly
pulls
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
which
is
miss
henrietta
it
obscures
her
miss
susan
this
this
is
my
niece
livvy
miss
willoughby
miss
henrietta
miss
fanny
willoughby
valentine
ladies
excuse
my
impatience
but
miss
willoughby
one
moment
sir
may
i
ask
miss
livvy
how
many
brothers
you
have
phoebe
two
miss
willoughby
i
thank
you
looks
strangely
miss
susan
miss
phoebe
that
she
has
phoebe
a
excluding
the
unhappy
thomas
miss
susan
for
the
only
moment
in
her
we
never
mention
him
are
swept
away
on
the
arms
of
the
captain
miss
willoughby
miss
henrietta
and
miss
fanny
what
has
thomas
done
have
no
suspicion
as
yet
of
miss
phoebe
done
but
they
believe
there
is
a
scandal
in
the
throssel
family
and
they
will
not
sleep
happily
until
they
know
what
it
of
act
act
iii
the
ball
ball
but
not
the
one
to
which
we
have
seen
miss
susan
and
miss
phoebe
rush
forth
upon
their
career
of
crime
this
is
the
third
of
the
series
the
one
of
which
patty
has
foretold
with
horrid
relish
that
it
promises
to
be
specially
given
over
to
devilries
the
scene
is
a
canvas
pavilion
used
as
a
retiring
room
and
for
card
play
and
through
an
opening
in
the
back
we
have
glimpses
of
gay
uniforms
and
fair
ladies
intermingled
in
the
bravery
of
the
dance
there
is
coming
and
going
through
this
opening
and
also
through
slits
in
the
canvas
the
pavilion
is
fantastically
decorated
in
various
tastes
and
is
lit
with
lanterns
a
moon
nevertheless
shines
into
it
benignly
some
of
the
card
tables
are
neglected
but
at
one
a
game
of
quadrille
is
in
progress
there
is
much
movement
and
hilarity
but
none
from
one
side
of
the
tent
where
sit
several
young
ladies
all
pretty
all
appealing
and
all
woeful
for
no
gallant
comes
to
ask
them
if
he
may
have
the
felicity
the
nervous
woman
chaperoning
them
and
afraid
to
meet
their
gaze
lest
they
scowl
or
weep
in
reply
is
no
other
than
miss
susan
the
most
unhappy
miss
susan
we
have
yet
seen
she
sits
there
gripping
her
composure
in
both
hands
far
less
susceptible
to
shame
is
the
brazen
phoebe
who
may
be
seen
passing
the
opening
on
the
arm
of
a
cavalier
and
flinging
her
trembling
sister
a
mischievous
kiss
the
younger
ladies
note
the
incident
alas
they
are
probably
meant
to
notice
it
and
they
cower
as
under
a
harriet
large
girl
who
we
hope
found
a
romance
at
her
next
are
we
so
disagreeable
that
no
one
will
dance
with
us
miss
susan
is
infamous
they
have
eyes
for
no
one
but
your
niece
charlotte
miss
livvy
has
taken
ensign
blades
from
me
harriet
if
miss
phoebe
were
here
i
am
sure
she
would
not
allow
her
old
pupils
to
be
so
neglected
only
possible
reply
miss
susan
to
make
herself
look
as
small
as
possible
a
lieutenant
comes
to
them
once
a
scorner
of
woman
but
spicer
harriet
a
moment
how
do
you
do
sir
spicer
dreadful
indifference
though
she
is
his
dear
nay
how
do
you
do
may
i
stand
beside
you
miss
susan
is
a
most
melancholic
young
man
and
he
fidgets
miss
susan
you
have
been
standing
beside
me
sir
nearly
all
the
evening
spicer
it
is
strange
to
think
that
he
had
been
favourably
mentioned
in
indeed
i
can
not
but
be
cognisant
of
the
sufferings
i
cause
by
attaching
myself
to
you
in
this
unseemly
manner

her

at

dance
but
she
has
left
a
defender
behind
a
gallant
name
we
have
not
succeeded
in
am
i
to
understand
sir
that
you
are
intimating
disparagement
of
the

certain
female
has
been
graciously
pleased
to
signify
approval
of
that
orb
any
slight
cast
upon
the
moon
sir
i
shall
regard
as
a
personal
affront
old
soldier
he
rises
and
they
face
each
other
miss
susan
for
battle
she
is
about
to
rush
between
their
undrawn
swords
when
there
is
a
commotion
outside

filled
with

sympathetic
and
inquisitive

a
physician
takes
command
and
by
his
order
they
retire
he
finds
difficulty
in
bringing
the
sufferer
to

gets
little
help

immoderately
why
do

the

the
opportunity
to
sit
up
on
her
couch
of
chairs

and
then
the
bolt
is
susan
miss
henrietta
and
miss
fanny
are
here
miss
susan
phoebe
phoebe
suddenly
my
eyes
lighted
on
them
at
once
i
slipped
to
the
ground
miss
susan
you
think
they
did
not
see
you
phoebe
i
am
sure
of
it
they
talked
for
a
moment
to
ensign
blades
and
then
turned
and
seemed
to
be
going
towards
the
shrubbery
miss
susan
he
had
heard
that
you
were
there
with
captain
brown
he
must
have
told
them
phoebe
i
was
not
but
oh
sister
i
am
sure
they
suspect
else
why
should
they
be
here
they
never
frequent
balls
miss
susan
they
have
suspected
for
a
week
ever
since
they
saw
you
in
your
veil
phoebe
on
the
night
of
the
first
dance
how
could
they
but
suspect
when
they
have
visited
us
every
day
since
then
and
we
have
always
pretended
that
livvy
was
gone
out
phoebe
should
they
see
my
face
it
will
be
idle
to
attempt
to
deceive
them
miss
susan
idle
indeed
phoebe
the
scandal
you
a
schoolmistress
phoebe
that
is
it
sister
a
little
happiness
has
gone
to
my
head
like
strong
waters
is
very
restless
and
miss
susan
my
dear
stand
still
and
think
phoebe
i
dare
not
i
can
not
oh
susan
if
they
see
me
we
need
not
open
school
again
miss
susan
we
shall
starve
phoebe
this
horrid
forward
flirting
heartless
hateful
little
toad
of
a
livvy
miss
susan
brother
james
daughter
as
we
call
her
phoebe
is
all
james
fault
miss
susan
sister
when
you
know
that
james
has
no
daughter
phoebe
if
he
had
really
had
one
think
you
i
could
have
been
so
wicked
as
to
personate
her
susan
i
know
not
what
i
am
saying
but
you
know
who
it
is
that
has
turned
me
into
this
wild
creature
miss
susan
oh
valentine
brown
how
could
you
phoebe
to
weary
of
phoebe
patient
phoebe
the
phoebe
whom
i
have
lost
to
turn
from
her
with
a
you
make
me
old
and
become
enamoured
in
a
night
of
a
thing
like
this
miss
susan
yes
yes
indeed
yet
he
has
been
kind
to
us
also
he
has
been
to
visit
us
several
times
phoebe
in
the
hope
to
see
her
was
he
not
most
silent
and
gloomy
when
we
said
she
was
gone
out
miss
susan
he
is
infatuate
sister
you
are
not
partial
to
him
still
phoebe
no
susan
no
i
did
love
him
all
those
years
though
i
never
spoke
of
it
to
you
i
put
hope
aside
at
once
i
folded
it
up
and
kissed
it
and
put
it
away
like
a
pretty
garment
i
could
never
wear
again
i
but
loved
to
think
of
him
as
a
noble
man
but
he
is
not
a
noble
man
and
livvy
found
it
out
in
an
hour
the
gallant
i
flirted
that
i
might
enjoy
his
fury
susan
there
has
been
a
declaration
in
his
eyes
all
and
when
he
cries
miss
livvy
be
mine
i
mean
to
answer
with
an
la
how
ridiculous
you
are
you
are
much
too
old
i
have
been
but
quizzing
you
sir
miss
susan
phoebe
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
phoebe
because
he
has
taken
from
me
the
one
great
glory
that
is
in
a
woman
life
not
a
man
love
she
can
do
without
that
but
her
own
dear
sweet
love
for
him
he
is
unworthy
of
my
love
that
is
why
i
can
be
so
cruel
miss
susan
oh
dear
phoebe
and
now
my
triumph
is
to
be
denied
me
for
we
must
steal
away
home
before
henrietta
and
fanny
see
us
miss
susan
yes
yes
phoebe
and
we
must
say
that
livvy
has
gone
back
to
her
father
for
i
dare
keep
up
this
deception
no
longer
susan
let
us
go
are
going
dejectedly
but
are
arrested
by
the
apparition
miss
henrietta
miss
fanny
into
the
phoebe
just
time
to
signify
to
her
sister
that
she
will
confess
all
and
beg
for
mercy
when
the
intruders
miss
henrietta
triumphant
but
you
miss
phoebe
phoebe
bowed
yes
miss
fanny
how
amazing
you
do
not
deny
that
you
are
miss
phoebe
phoebe
yes
fanny
i
am
miss
phoebe
her
henrietta
fanny
ashamed
miss
henrietta
miss
phoebe
we
have
done
you
a
cruel
wrong
miss
fanny
phoebe
we
apologise
miss
henrietta
to
think
how
excitedly
we
have
been
following
her
about
in
the
shrubbery
miss
fanny
she
is
wearing
your
cloak
miss
henrietta
ensign
blades
told
us
she
was
gone
to
the
shrubbery
miss
fanny
and
we
were
convinced
there
was
no
such
person
miss
henrietta
so
of
course
we
thought
it
must
be
you
miss
fanny
has
looked
i
can
discern
her
in
the
shrubbery
still
she
is
decidedly
taller
than
phoebe
miss
henrietta
i
thought
she
looked
taller
i
meant
to
say
so
phoebe
was
the
cloak
deceived
us
we
could
not
see
her
face
phoebe
to
cloak
you
mean
henrietta
you
mean
fanny
miss
fanny
was
wicked
of
us
my
dear
but
we
we
thought
that
you
and
miss
livvy
were
the
same
person
have
evidently
been
charlotte
miss
phoebe
miss
susan
miss
phoebe
a
cry
of
reproach
and
it
is
some
time
before
they
can
persuade
her
to
forgive
them
it
is
of
course
also
some
time
before
we
can
miss
phoebe
phoebe
you
look
so
pretty
are
they
paying
you
no
attentions
my
dear
phoebe
unable
to
resist
these
delightful
openings
the
imploring
miss
susan
her
but
add
to
her
enjoyment
it
is
as
if
the
sense
of
fun
she
had
caged
a
moment
ago
were
broke
loose
phoebe
alas
they
think
of
none
but
livvy
they
come
to
me
merely
to
say
that
they
adore
her
miss
henrietta
surely
not
captain
brown
phoebe
he
is
infatuate
about
her
miss
fanny
poor
phoebe
make
much
of
her
and
she
purrs
naughtily
to
their
stroking
with
lightning
peeps
miss
susan
providence
seeks
to
pay
her
out
by
ensign
blades
the
tent
then
the
close
observer
may
miss
phoebe
sink
like
a
bucket
in
a
miss
susan
from
the
miss
henrietta
blades
i
have
been
saying
that
if
i
were
a
gentleman
i
would
pay
my
addresses
to
miss
phoebe
much
rather
than
to
her
niece
blades
excuse
me
miss
henrietta
miss
phoebe
be
slighted
so
sir
you
are
a
most
ungallant
and
deficient
young
man
blades
really
i
assure
you
miss
henrietta
not
another
word
sir
phoebe
her
most
miss
fanny
miss
henrietta
it
is
time
i
spoke
plainly
to
this
gentleman
please
leave
him
to
me
surely
come
best
from
me
miss
henrietta
indeed
yes
if
it
be
not
too
painful
to
you
phoebe
i
must
do
my
duty
miss
fanny
if
we
could
remain
phoebe
would
it
be
seemly
miss
fanny
miss
henrietta
come
fanny
blades
sir
you
bring
your
punishment
upon
yourself
phoebe
and
go
her
heart
returns
to
its
usual
blades

you
angry
with
me
miss
livvy
phoebe
oh
no
blades
miss
livvy
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
of
supreme
importance
to
me
with
regard
to
my
complexion
i
am
aware
miss
livvy
that
it
has
retained
a
too
youthful
bloom
my
brother
officers
comment
on
it
with
a
certain
lack
of
generosity
might
i
inquire
whether
you
regard
my
complexion
as
a
subject
for
light
talk
phoebe
no
indeed
sir
i
only
wish
i
had
it
blades
has
had
no
intention
of
offering
but
is
suddenly
carried
off
his
feet
by
the
excellence
of
the
opportunity
which
is
no
doubt
responsible
for
many
miss
livvy
you
may
have
it
has
a
great
and
humorous
longing
that
she
could
turn
before
his
affrighted
eyes
into
the
schoolmistress
she
really
is
she
would
endure
much
to
be
able
at
this
moment
to
say
have
listened
to
you
ensign
blades
attention
but
i
am
miss
phoebe
i
must
now
request
you
to
fetch
me
the
implement
under
the
shock
would
he
have
surrendered
his
palm
for
punishment
it
can
never
be
known
for
as
she
looks
at
him
longingly
lieutenant

and
he
mistakes
the
meaning
of
that
longing
spicer
is
my
dance
is
not
ensign
blades
blades
leave
us

we
have
matter
of
moment
to
discuss
spicer

his
affection

not
so
deep
as
mine
he
is
a
light
and
shallow
nature
phoebe

are
both
light
and
shallow
natures
blades
both
he
is
not
sure
that
he
has
not
had
a
miraculous
phoebe

such
as
you
with
your
foolish
flirting
ways
that
confuse
the
minds
of

and
make
us
try
to
be
as
silly
as
yourselves
spicer
phoebe
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
takes
a
hand
of
each
and
tries
to
advise
them

once
more
hidden

a
school

here
beside
me

know
you

very
brave
blades

phoebe

be
so
delightful
to
you
to
flirt
with
the
ladies
again

phoebe
as
soon
as
you
see
a
lady
with
a
pretty
nose

can
not
help
saying
that
you
adore
her
blades
an
nay
i
swear
phoebe

she
has
grown
weary
so
much
as
of
the
lady

her
feelings

to
make
clear
to
miss
livvy
as
soon
as
you
gentlemen
have
retired
phoebe
that
the
declaration
is
coming
she
steels
phoebe
i
am
curious
to
know
what
captain
brown
can
have
to
say
to
me
in
a
few
minutes
blades
lieutenant
spicer
i
shall
be
at
your
service
valentine
i
trust
not
phoebe
i
give
them
my
word
young
gentlemen
retire
treading
air
once
brown
her
rather
valentine
you
are
an
amazing
pretty
girl
but
you
are
a
shocking
flirt
phoebe
la
valentine
it
has
somewhat
diverted
me
to
watch
them
go
down
before
you
but
i
know
you
have
a
kind
heart
and
that
if
there
be
a
rapier
in
your
one
hand
there
is
a
handkerchief
in
the
other
ready
to
staunch
their
wounds
phoebe
i
have
not
observed
that
they
bled
much
valentine
the
blades
and
the
like
no
but
one
may
perhaps
phoebe
the
reference
is
to
perhaps
i
may
wish
to
see
him
bleed
valentine
for
shame
miss
livvy
rises
in
her
but
she
wishes
him
to
i
speak
in
the
interests
of
the
man
to
whom
i
hope
to
see
you
affianced
she
does
not
wish
him
to
proceed
she
had
esteemed
him
for
so
long
she
can
not
have
him
debase
himself
before
her
phoebe
shall
we
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
consent
to
go
home
please
to
say
nothing
valentine
nay
phoebe
i
beg
you
valentine
no
we
must
have
it
out
phoebe
then
if
you
must
go
on
do
so
but
remember
i
begged
you
to
desist
who
is
this
happy
man
next
words
are
a
great
shock
to
valentine
as
to
who
he
is
of
course
i
have
no
notion
nor
i
am
sure
have
you
else
you
would
be
more
guarded
in
your
conduct
but
some
day
miss
livvy
the
right
man
will
come
not
to
be
able
to
tell
him
all
would
it
not
be
hard
and
how
could
you
acquaint
him
with
this
poor
sport
his
face
would
change
as
you
told
him
of
it
and
yours
would
be
a
false
face
until
it
was
told
this
is
what
i
have
been
so
desirous
to
say
to
you
by
the
right
of
a
friend
phoebe
a
low
voice
but
i
see
valentine
that
he
has
hurt
it
has
been
hard
to
say
and
i
have
done
it
bunglingly
ah
but
believe
me
miss
livvy
it
is
not
the
flaunting
flower
men
love
it
is
the
modest
violet
phoebe
the
modest
violet
dare
to
say
that
valentine
yes
indeed
and
when
you
are
acquaint
with
what
love
really
is
phoebe
love
what
do
you
know
of
love
valentine
little
why
i
know
all
about
it
i
am
in
love
miss
livvy
phoebe
a
disdainful
inclination
of
the
i
wish
you
happy
valentine
with
a
lady
who
was
once
very
like
you
phoebe
not
understand
then
a
suspicion
of
his
meaning
comes
to
phoebe
not
not
oh
no
valentine
i
had
not
meant
to
speak
of
it
but
why
should
not
i
it
will
be
a
fine
lesson
to
you
miss
livvy
it
is
your
aunt
phoebe
whom
i
love
phoebe
you
do
not
mean
that
valentine
most
ardently
phoebe
it
is
not
true
how
dare
you
make
sport
of
her
valentine
is
it
sport
to
wish
she
may
be
my
wife
phoebe
your
wife
valentine
if
i
could
win
her
phoebe
may
i
solicit
sir
for
how
long
you
have
been
attached
to
miss
phoebe
valentine
for
nine
years
i
think
phoebe
you
think
valentine
i
want
to
be
honest
never
in
all
that
time
had
i
thought
myself
in
love
your
aunts
were
my
dear
friends
and
while
i
was
at
the
wars
we
sometimes
wrote
to
each
other
but
they
were
only
friendly
letters
i
presume
the
affection
was
too
placid
to
be
love
phoebe
i
think
that
would
be
aunt
phoebe
opinion
valentine
yet
i
remember
before
we
went
into
action
for
the
first
time
i
suppose
the
fear
of
death
was
upon
me
some
of
them
were
making
their
wills
i
have
no
near
relative
i
left
everything
to
these
two
ladies
phoebe
did
you
is
it
miss
phoebe
to
see
as
she
sits
there
so
quietly
with
her
hands
pressed
together
as
if
upon
some
treasure
it
phoebe
the
ringlets
with
the
stain
taken
out
of
valentine
and
when
i
returned
a
week
ago
and
saw
miss
phoebe
grown
so
and
so
poor
phoebe
the
shock
made
you
feel
old
i
know
valentine
no
miss
livvy
but
it
filled
me
with
a
sudden
passionate
regret
that
i
had
not
gone
down
in
that
first
engagement
they
would
have
been
very
comfortably
left
phoebe
oh
sir
valentine
i
am
not
calling
it
love
phoebe
it
was
sweet
and
kind
but
it
was
not
love
valentine
it
is
love
now
phoebe
no
it
is
only
pity
valentine
it
is
love
phoebe
smiles
you
really
mean
phoebe
tired
unattractive
phoebe
that
woman
whose
girlhood
is
gone
nay
impossible
valentine
phoebe
of
the
fascinating
playful
ways
whose
ringlets
were
once
as
pretty
as
yours
i
have
visited
her
in
her
home
several
times
this
week
you
were
always
out
i
thank
you
for
that
i
was
alone
with
her
and
with
fragrant
memories
of
her
phoebe
memories
yes
that
is
the
phoebe
you
love
the
bright
girl
of
the
past
not
the
schoolmistress
in
her
cap
valentine
there
you
wrong
me
for
i
have
discovered
for
myself
that
the
schoolmistress
in
her
cap
is
the
noblest
miss
phoebe
of
them
all
only
he
would
go
away
and
miss
phoebe
when
i
enlisted
i
remember
i
compared
her
to
a
garden
i
have
often
thought
of
that
phoebe
is
an
old
garden
now
valentine
the
paths
are
better
shaded
phoebe
the
flowers
have
grown
valentine
they
smell
the
sweeter
miss
livvy
do
you
think
there
is
any
hope
for
me
phoebe
there
was
a
man
whom
miss
phoebe
loved
long
ago
he
did
not
love
her
valentine
now
here
was
a
fool
phoebe
he
kissed
her
once
valentine
if
miss
phoebe
suffered
him
to
do
that
she
thought
he
loved
her
phoebe
yes
yes
has
to
ask
him
the
ten
years
old
do
you
opinion
that
this
makes
her
action
in
allowing
it
less
reprehensible
it
has
been
such
a
pain
to
her
ever
since
valentine
how
like
miss
phoebe
but
that
man
was
a
knave
phoebe
no
he
was
a
good
man
only
a
little
inconsiderate
she
knows
now
that
he
has
even
forgotten
that
he
did
it
i
suppose
men
are
like
that
valentine
no
miss
livvy
men
are
not
like
that
i
am
a
very
average
man
but
i
thank
god
i
am
not
like
that
phoebe
it
was
you
valentine
a
did
miss
phoebe
say
that
phoebe
yes
valentine
then
it
is
true
is
very
grave
and
phoebe
it
was
raining
and
her
face
was
wet
you
said
you
did
it
because
her
face
was
wet
valentine
i
had
quite
forgotten
phoebe
but
she
remembers
and
how
often
do
you
think
the
shameful
memory
has
made
her
face
wet
since
the
face
you
love
captain
brown
you
were
the
first
to
give
it
pain
the
tired
eyes
how
much
less
tired
they
might
be
if
they
had
never
known
you
you
who
are
torturing
me
with
every
word
what
have
you
done
to
miss
phoebe
you
who
think
you
can
bring
back
the
bloom
to
that
faded
garden
and
all
the
pretty
airs
and
graces
that
fluttered
round
it
once
like
little
birds
before
the
nest
is
torn
down
bring
them
back
to
her
if
you
can
sir
it
was
you
who
took
them
away
valentine
i
vow
i
shall
do
my
best
to
bring
them
back
miss
phoebe
her
miss
livvy
with
your
help
phoebe
my
help
i
have
not
helped
i
tried
to
spoil
it
all
valentine
to
spoil
it
you
mean
that
you
sought
to
flirt
even
with
me
ah
i
knew
you
did
but
that
is
nothing
phoebe
oh
sir
if
you
could
overlook
it
valentine
i
do
phoebe
and
forget
these
hateful
balls
valentine
hateful
nay
i
shall
never
call
them
that
they
have
done
me
too
great
a
service
it
was
at
the
balls
that
i
fell
in
love
with
miss
phoebe
phoebe
what
can
you
mean
valentine
she
who
was
never
at
a
ball
himself
but
i
must
not
tell
you
it
might
hurt
you
phoebe
tell
me
valentine
then
on
your
own
head
be
the
blame
it
is
you
who
have
made
me
love
her
miss
livvy
phoebe
sir
valentine
yes
it
is
odd
and
yet
very
simple
you
who
so
resembled
her
as
she
was
for
an
hour
you
bewitched
me
yes
i
confess
it
but
was
only
for
an
hour
how
like
i
cried
at
first
but
soon
it
was
how
unlike
there
was
almost
nothing
she
would
have
said
that
you
said
you
did
so
much
that
she
would
have
scorned
to
do
but
i
must
not
say
these
things
to
you
phoebe
i
ask
it
of
you
captain
brown
valentine
well
miss
phoebe
on
which
she
set
such
store
that
i
used
to
make
merry
of
the
word
i
gradually
perceived
that
it
is
a
woman
most
beautiful
garment
and
the
casket
which
contains
all
the
adorable
qualities
that
go
to
the
making
of
a
perfect
female
when
miss
livvy
rolled
her
eyes
ah
stops
phoebe
proceed
sir
valentine
it
but
made
me
the
more
complacent
that
never
in
her
life
had
miss
phoebe
been
guilty
of
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
strictest
propriety
i
was
always
conceiving
her
in
your
place
oh
it
was
monstrous
unfair
to
you
i
stood
looking
at
you
miss
livvy
and
seeing
in
my
mind
her
and
the
pretty
things
she
did
and
you
did
not
do
why
that
is
how
i
fell
in
love
with
miss
phoebe
at
the
balls
phoebe
i
thank
you
valentine
tell
me
do
you
think
there
is
any
hope
for
me
phoebe
hope
valentine
i
shall
go
to
her
phoebe
i
will
say
oh
so
reverently
phoebe
my
beautiful
most
estimable
of
women
let
me
take
care
of
you
for
ever
more
miss
phoebe
the
words
to
her
heart
and
then
drops
phoebe
beautiful
la
aunt
phoebe
valentine
ah
you
may
laugh
at
a
rough
soldier
so
much
enamoured
but
is
true
me
miss
phoebe
i
will
say
i
will
take
you
back
through
those
years
of
hardships
that
have
made
your
sweet
eyes
too
patient
instead
of
growing
older
you
shall
grow
younger
we
will
travel
back
together
to
pick
up
the
many
little
joys
and
pleasures
you
had
to
pass
by
when
you
trod
that
thorny
path
alone
phoebe
ca
be
ca
be
valentine
nay
miss
phoebe
has
loved
me
is
you
have
said
it
phoebe
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
valentine
she
will
be
my
wife
yet
phoebe
never
valentine
you
are
severe
miss
livvy
but
it
is
because
you
are
partial
to
her
and
i
am
happy
of
that
phoebe
growing
horror
of
i
partial
to
her
i
am
laughing
at
both
of
you
miss
phoebe
la
that
old
thing
valentine
silence
phoebe
i
hate
her
and
despise
her
if
you
knew
what
she
is
stops
her
with
a
valentine
i
know
what
you
are
phoebe
that
paragon
who
has
never
been
guilty
of
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
strictest
propriety
valentine
never
phoebe
that
garden
valentine
miss
livvy
for
shame
phoebe
your
garden
has
been
destroyed
sir
the
weeds
have
entered
it
and
all
the
flowers
are
choked
valentine
you
false
woman
what
do
you
mean
phoebe
i
will
tell
you
his
confidence
awes
what
faith
you
have
in
her
valentine
as
in
my
god
speak
phoebe
i
can
not
tell
you
valentine
no
you
can
not
phoebe
it
is
too
horrible
valentine
you
are
too
horrible
is
not
that
it
phoebe
yes
that
is
it
miss
susan
entered
and
caught
the
last
miss
susan
as
from
a
coming
what
is
too
horrible
valentine
i
leave
the
telling
of
it
to
her
if
she
dare
and
i
devoutly
hope
those
are
the
last
words
i
shall
ever
address
to
this
lady
bows
and
goes
out
in
miss
susan
all
is
discovered
and
miss
phoebe
for
ever
miss
susan
phoebe
her
my
love
my
dear
what
terrible
thing
has
he
said
to
you
phoebe
everything
but
that
she
is
not
terrible
glorious
susan
is
phoebe
he
loves
is
me
not
livvy
he
loves
me
he
loves
me
me
phoebe
miss
susan
swells
it
is
her
great
hour
as
much
phoebe
of
act
act
iv
the
blue
and
white
room
we
could
shut
our
eyes
to
the
two
sisters
sitting
here
in
woe
this
would
be
to
the
male
eye
at
least
the
identical
blue
and
white
room
of
ten
years
ago
the
same
sun
shining
into
it
and
playing
familiarly
with
miss
susan
treasures
but
the
ladies
are
changed
it
is
not
merely
that
miss
phoebe
has
again
donned
her
schoolmistress
gown
and
hidden
her
curls
under
the
cap
to
see
her
thus
once
more
her
real
self
after
the
escapade
of
the
ball
is
not
unpleasant
and
the
cap
and
gown
do
not
ill
become
the
quiet
room
but
she
now
turns
guiltily
from
the
sun
that
used
to
be
her
intimate
her
face
is
drawn
her
form
condensed
into
the
smallest
space
and
her
hands
lie
trembling
in
her
lap
it
is
disquieting
to
note
that
any
life
there
is
in
the
room
comes
not
from
her
but
from
miss
susan
if
the
house
were
to
go
on
fire
now
it
would
be
she
who
would
have
to
carry
out
miss
of
import
has
happened
since
the
ball
patty
knows
it
and
is
enjoying
it
we
see
this
as
she
ushers
in
miss
willoughby
note
also
with
concern
that
at
mention
of
the
visitor
name
the
eyes
of
the
sisters
turn
affrightedly
not
to
the
door
by
which
their
old
friend
enters
but
to
the
closed
door
of
the
spare
patty
also
gives
it
a
meaning
glance
then
the
three
look
at
each
other
and
two
of
them
miss
willoughby
fourth
to
look
at
the
i
am
just
run
across
susan
to
inquire
how
miss
livvy
does
now
miss
susan
she
is
still
very
poorly
mary
miss
willoughby
i
am
so
unhappy
of
that
i
conceive
it
to
be
a
nervous
disorder
miss
susan
too
accompanied
by
trembling
flutterings
and
spasms
miss
willoughby
the
excitements
of
the
ball
you
have
summoned
the
apothecary
at
last
i
trust
phoebe
miss
phoebe
so
ready
of
defence
can
say
miss
susan
the
it
is
livvy
own
wish
that
he
should
not
be
consulted
miss
willoughby
longingly
at
the
may
i
go
in
to
see
her
miss
susan
i
fear
not
mary
she
is
almost
asleep
and
it
is
best
not
to
disturb
her
into
the
lie
quite
still
livvy
my
love
quite
still
this
patty
so
broadly
that
she
finds
it
advisable
to
miss
willoughby
and
produces
a
small
bowl
from
the
folds
of
her
miss
willoughby
this
is
a
little
arrowroot
of
which
i
hope
miss
livvy
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
partake
miss
susan
the
i
thank
you
mary
phoebe
susan
we
ought
not
miss
susan
i
will
take
it
to
her
while
it
is
still
warm
goes
into
the
miss
willoughby
miss
phoebe
certainly
shrinks
it
has
not
escaped
the
notice
of
the
visitor
miss
phoebe
become
the
more
timid
of
the
sisters
and
she
has
evolved
an
miss
willoughby
phoebe
has
captain
brown
been
apprised
of
miss
livvy
illness
phoebe
i
think
not
miss
willoughby
miss
willoughby
phoebe
speaking
very
is
this
right
phoebe
you
informed
fanny
and
henrietta
at
the
ball
of
his
partiality
for
livvy
my
dear
it
is
hard
for
you
but
have
you
any
right
to
keep
them
apart
phoebe
only
now
what
are
the
suspicions
of
her
is
that
what
you
think
i
am
doing
miss
willoughby
miss
willoughby
such
a
mysterious
illness
long
ago
phoebe
i
once
caused
much
unhappiness
through
foolish
jealousy
that
is
why
i
venture
to
hope
that
you
will
not
be
as
i
was
my
dear
phoebe
i
jealous
of
livvy
miss
willoughby
a
i
thought
as
little
of
the
lady
i
refer
to
but
he
thought
otherwise
phoebe
indeed
miss
willoughby
you
wrong
me
miss
willoughby
not
entirely
believe
her
and
there
is
a
pause
so
long
a
pause
that
miss
susan
she
has
left
the
miss
susan
is
she
gone
miss
willoughby
no
susan
but
i
am
going
miss
susan
mary
follows
her
out
miss
willoughby
not
be
comforted
and
there
is
a
coldness
between
them
for
the
rest
of
the
miss
susan
not
so
abashed
as
she
ought
to
be
she
returns
and
partakes
with
avidity
of
the
miss
susan
phoebe
i
am
well
aware
that
this
is
wrong
of
me
but
mary
arrowroot
is
so
delicious
the
and
those
officers
sent
to
livvy
i
ate
them
also
on
a
time
this
would
have
miss
phoebe
her
sense
of
humour
has
gone
she
is
phoebe
if
you
have
such
remorse
you
will
weep
yourself
to
death
phoebe
oh
sister
were
it
not
for
you
how
gladly
would
i
go
into
a
decline
miss
susan
she
has
phoebe
my
dear
what
is
to
be
done
about
her
we
can
not
have
her
supposed
to
be
here
for
ever
phoebe
we
had
to
pretend
that
she
was
ill
to
keep
her
out
of
sight
and
now
we
can
not
say
she
has
gone
away
for
the
miss
windows
command
our
door
and
they
are
always
watching
miss
susan
from
the
i
see
fanny
watching
now
i
feel
phoebe
as
if
livvy
really
existed
phoebe
we
shall
never
be
able
to
esteem
ourselves
again
miss
susan
has
in
her
the
makings
of
a
desperate
phoebe
why
not
marry
him
if
only
we
could
make
him
think
that
livvy
had
gone
home
then
he
need
never
know
phoebe
susan
you
pain
me
she
who
marries
without
telling
all
hers
must
ever
be
a
false
face
they
are
his
own
words
patty
patty
captain
brown
phoebe
i
wrote
to
him
begging
him
not
to
come

on
the
ottoman
miss
susan
politely
ignores

it
is
not
my
wish
to
detain
you
patty
patty
reluctantly
and
the
sisters
think
how
like

how
delightful
it
would
be
if
they
were
still
the
patterns
of
propriety
he
considers
phoebe
captain
brown
valentine

hear

valentine

skulker
i
hope
but
gradually
turning
into
a
grumpy
crusty
old
bachelor
phoebe

and
all
because
you
will
not
walk
across
the
street
with
me
phoebe

may
be

one
that
reminds
me
miss
phoebe

trifle

to
a
certain
lady
who
is
modestly
unaware
of
her
resemblance
to
a
garden
wrote
by
her
servant
v
b
beauty
of
this
makes
her
falter
she
looks
valentine
a
poet
there
is
more
of
it
phoebe
the
lilies
are
her
pretty
thoughts
her
shoulders
are
the
may
her
smiles
are
all
the
path
her
gracious
way
the
roses
that
do
line
it
are
her
fancies
walking
round
is
sweetly
smelling
lavender
in
which
my
lady
gowned
miss
phoebe
thought
herself
strong
but
she
is
not
able
to
read
such
exquisite
lines
without
betraying
herself
to
a
lover
valentine
miss
phoebe
when
did
you
cease
to
care
for
me
phoebe
from
him
but
clinging
to
her
you
promised
not
to
ask
valentine
i
know
not
why
you
should
miss
phoebe
but
i
believe
you
love
me
still
miss
phoebe
the
terrified
appearance
of
a
detected
susan
miss
susan
you
are
talking
so
loudly
valentine
miss
susan
does
she
care
for
me
still
miss
susan
her
pride

by
gad

marry
me
though
i
have
to
carry
you
in
my
arms
to
the
church
phoebe
sir
how
can
you
miss
susan
her
a
look
which
means
that
it
must
be
done
if
only
to
avoid
such
a
scandal
it
is
at
this
inopportune
moment
miss
henrietta
miss
fanny
miss
henrietta
i
think
miss
willoughby
has
already
popped
in
phoebe
a
little
yes
indeed
miss
susan
mistress
of
how
is
mary
fanny
she
has
not
been
to
see
us
for
several
minutes
miss
fanny
mary
is
so
partial
to
you
susan
valentine
your
servant
miss
henrietta
miss
fanny
miss
fanny
how
do
you
do
sir
miss
henrietta
and
how
do
you
find
miss
livvy
sir
valentine
i
have
not
seen
her
miss
henrietta
miss
henrietta
indeed
miss
fanny
not
even
you
valentine
you
seem
surprised
miss
fanny
nay
sir
you
must
not
say
so
but
really
phoebe
phoebe
fanny
you
presume
valentine
if
one
of
you
ladies
would
deign
to
enlighten
me
to
begin
with
what
is
miss
livvy
malady
miss
henrietta
he
does
not
know
oh
phoebe
valentine
ladies
have
pity
on
a
dull
man
and
explain
miss
fanny
please
not
to
ask
us
to
explain
i
fear
we
have
already
said
more
than
was
proper
phoebe
forgive
captain
brown
but
adds
to
the
mystery
and
he
looks
phoebe
phoebe
i
understand
sir
there
is
a
belief
that
i
keep
livvy
in
confinement
because
of
your
passion
for
her
valentine
my
passion
for
miss
livvy
why
miss
fanny
i
can
not
abide
her
nor
she
me
manfully
miss
phoebe
furthermore
i
am
proud
to
tell
you
that
this
is
the
lady
whom
i
adore
miss
fanny
phoebe
valentine
yes
ladies
are
for
a
moment
bereft
of
speech
and
the
phoebe
refrain
from
a
movement
which
if
completed
would
be
a
curtsy
her
punishment
follows
miss
henrietta
her
phoebe
i
am
so
happy
is
you
miss
fanny
dear
phoebe
i
give
you
joy
and
you
also
sir
miss
phoebe
her
sister
a
glance
of
unutterable
woe
and
escapes
from
the
room
it
is
most
of
miss
susan
i
do
not
understand
miss
henrietta
is
it
that
miss
livvy
is
an
obstacle
miss
susan
knows
that
there
is
no
hope
for
her
but
in
i
think
i
hear
phoebe
calling
me
a
sudden
indisposition
pray
excuse
me
henrietta
miss
henrietta
we
know
not
sir
whether
to
offer
you
our
felicitations
valentine
may
i
ask
what
you
mean
by
an
obstacle
is
there
some
mystery
about
miss
livvy
miss
henrietta
so
much
so
sir
that
we
at
one
time
thought
she
and
miss
phoebe
were
the
same
person
valentine
pshaw
miss
fanny
why
will
they
admit
no
physician
into
her
presence
miss
henrietta
the
blinds
of
her
room
are
kept
most
artfully
drawn
miss
fanny
we
have
never
seen
her
sir
neither
miss
susan
nor
miss
phoebe
will
present
her
to
us
valentine
indeed
miss
henrietta
miss
fanny
by
his
sympathy
draw
nearer
the
door
of
the
interesting
bedchamber
they
falter
any
one
who
thinks
however
that
they
would
so
far
forget
themselves
as
to
open
the
door
and
peep
in
has
no
understanding
of
the
ladies
of
quality
street
they
are
nevertheless
not
perfect
miss
henrietta
on
the
miss
henrietta
how
do
you
find
yourself
dear
miss
livvy
is
no
answer
it
is
our
pride
to
record
that
they
come
away
without
even
touching
the
handle
they
look
appealing
captain
brown
face
has
grown
valentine
i
think
ladies
as
a
physician
walks
into
the
bedroom
they
feel
an
ignoble
drawing
to
follow
him
but
do
not
yield
to
it
when
he
returns
his
face
is
miss
henrietta
is
she
very
poorly
sir
valentine
ha
miss
fanny
we
did
not
hear
you
address
her
valentine
she
is
not
awake
miss
henrietta
it
is
provoking
miss
fanny
they
informed
mary
that
she
was
nigh
asleep
valentine
it
is
not
a
serious
illness
i
think
with
the
permission
of
miss
phoebe
and
miss
susan
i
will
make
myself
more
acquaint
with
her
disorder
presently
is
desirous
to
be
but
we
must
not
talk
lest
we
disturb
her
miss
fanny
you
suggest
our
retiring
sir
valentine
nay
miss
fanny
miss
fanny
you
are
very
obliging
but
i
think
henrietta
miss
henrietta
yes
fanny

they
are
the
more
ready
to
depart
that
they
wish
to
miss
willoughby
once
of
these
strange
doings
as
they
miss
susan
miss
phoebe
and
the
adieux
are
less
elaborate
than
usual
neither
visitors
nor
hostesses
quite
know
what
to
miss
susan
merely
relieved
to
see
them
leave
miss
phoebe

something
in
their
manner
that
makes
her
phoebe
