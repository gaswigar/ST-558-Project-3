irate
figure
in
faded
overalls
and
black
shirt

his
back
to
the
weathered
and
the
line
of
yellowing
woods
and
the

the

protector
aimed
his
leica
at
the
carcass
of
the
dog
and
snapped
the
shutter
we

something
about
it
he
said
shortly
then
he
stepped
ten
feet
to
the
left
and
edged
around
the
mangled
heifer
choosing
an
angle
for
his
camera
shot
the
two
men
in
the
gray
whipcords
of
the
state
police
seeing
that
parker
was
through
with
the
dog
moved
in
and
squatted
to
examine
it
the
one
with
the
triple
chevrons
on
his
sleeves
took
it
by
both
forefeet
and
flipped
it
over
on
its
back
it
had
been
a
big
brute
of
nondescript
breed
with
a
rough
coat
something
had
clawed
it
deeply
about
the
head
its
throat
was
slashed
transversely
several
times
and
it
had
been
disemboweled
by
a
single
slash
that
had
opened
its
belly
from
breastbone
to
tail
they
looked
at
it
carefully
and
then
went
to
stand
beside
parker
while
he
photographed
the
dead
heifer
like
the
dog
it
had
been
on
either
side
of
the
head
and
its
throat
had
been
slashed
deeply
several
times
in
addition
flesh
had
been
torn
from
one
flank
in
great
strips
i
ca
kill
a
bear
outa
season
no
strawmyer
continued
his
plaint
but
a
bear
comes
an
kills
my
stock
an
my
dog
that
there
all
right
that
the
kinda
deal
a
farmer
always
gits
in
this
state
i
do
like
t
use
profane
language
then
do
parker
barked
at
him
impatiently
do
use
any
kind
of
language
just
put
in
your
claim
and
shut
up
he
turned
to
the
men
in
whipcords
and
gray
stetsons
you
boys
seen
everything
he
asked
then
let
go
they
walked
briskly
back
to
the
barnyard
strawmyer
following
them
still
vociferating
about
the
wrongs
of
the
farmer
at
the
hands
of
a
cynical
and
corrupt
state
government
they
climbed
into
the
state
police
car
the
sergeant
and
the
private
in
front
and
parker
into
the
rear
laying
his
camera
on
the
seat
beside
a
winchester
carbine
were
you
pretty
short
with
that
fellow
back
there
steve
the
sergeant
asked
as
the
private
started
the
car
not
too
short
do
like
t
use
profane
language
parker
mimicked
the
bereaved
heifer
owner
and
then
he
went
on
to
specify
i
morally
certain
that
he
shot
at
least
four
illegal
deer
in
the
last
year
when
and
if
i
ever
get
anything
on
him
he
going
to
be
sorrier
for
himself
then
he
is
now
they
the
characters
that
always
beef
their
heads
off
the
sergeant
agreed
you
think
that
whatever
did
this
was
the
same
as
the
others
yes
the
dog
must
have
jumped
it
while
it
was
eating
at
the
heifer
same
superficial
scratches
about
the
head
and
deep
cuts
on
the
throat
or
belly
the
bigger
the
animal
the
farther
front
the
big
slashes
occur
evidently
something
grabs
them
by
the
head
with
front
claws
and
slashes
with
hind
claws
that
why
i
think
it
a
bobcat
you
know
the
private
said
i
saw
a
lot
of
wounds
like
that
during
the
war
my
outfit
landed
on
mindanao
where
the
guerrillas
had
been
active
and
this
looks
like
to
me
the
are
full
of
machetes
and
jungle
knives
the
sergeant
considered
i
think
i
call
up
doc
winters
at
the
county
hospital
and
see
if
all
his
is
present
and
accounted
for
but
most
of
the
livestock
was
eaten
at
like
the
heifer
parker
objected
by
definition
nuts
have
abnormal
tastes
the
sergeant
replied
or
the
eating
might
have
been
done
later
by
foxes
i
hope
so
that
let
me
out
parker
said
ha
listen
to
the
man
the
private
howled
stopping
the
car
at
the
end
of
the
lane
he
thinks
a
nut
with
a
machete
and
a
tarzan
complex
is
just
good
clean
fun
which
way
now
well
let
see
the
sergeant
had
unfolded
a
quadrangle
sheet
the
game
protector
leaned
forward
to
look
at
it
over
his
shoulder
the
sergeant
ran
a
finger
from
one
to
another
of
a
series
of
variously
colored
crosses
which
had
been
marked
on
the
map
monday
night
over
here
on
copperhead
mountain
that
cow
was
killed
he
said
the
next
night
about
ten
that
sheepflock
was
hit
on
this
side
of
copperhead
right
about
here
early
wednesday
night
that
mule
got
slashed
up
in
the
woods
back
of
the
weston
farm
it
was
only
slightly
injured
must
have
kicked
the
whatzit
and
got
away
but
the
whatzit
was
too
badly
hurt
because
a
few
hours
later
it
hit
that
on
the
rhymer
farm
and
last
night
it
did
that
he
jerked
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
at
the
strawmyer
farm
see
following
the
ridges
working
toward
the
southeast
avoiding
open
ground
killing
only
at
night
could
be
a
bobcat
at
that
or
jink
maniac
with
the
machete
parker
agreed
let
go
up
by
hindman
gap
and
see
if
we
can
see
anything
they
turned
after
a
while
into
a
rutted
dirt
road
which
deteriorated
steadily
into
a
track
through
the
woods
finally
they
stopped
and
the
private
backed
off
the
road
the
three
men
got
out
parker
with
his
winchester
the
sergeant
checking
the
drum
of
a
thompson
and
the
private
pumping
a
buckshot
shell
into
the
chamber
of
a
riot
gun
for
half
an
hour
they
followed
the
trail
beside
the
little
stream
once
they
passed
a
dark
gray
jeep
backed
to
one
side
then
they
came
to
the
head
of
the
gap
a
man
wearing
a
tweed
coat
tan
field
boots
and
khaki
breeches
was
sitting
on
a
log
smoking
a
pipe
he
had
a
rifle
across
his
knees
and
a
pair
of
binoculars
hung
from
his
neck
he
seemed
about
thirty
years
old
and
any
idol
of
the
screen
would
have
envied
him
the
handsome
regularity
of
his
strangely
immobile
features
as
parker
and
the
two
state
policemen
approached
he
rose
slinging
his
rifle
and
greeted
them
sergeant
haines
is
it
he
asked
pleasantly
are
you
gentlemen
out
hunting
the
critter
too
good
afternoon
lee
i
thought
that
was
your
jeep
i
saw
down
the
road
a
little
the
sergeant
turned
to
the
others
richard
lee
staying
at
the
old
kinchwalter
place
the
other
side
of
rutter
fort
this
is
parker
the
district
game
protector
and
private
zinkowski
he
glanced
at
the
rifle
are
you
out
hunting
for
it
too
yes
i
thought
i
might
find
something
up
here
what
do
you
think
it
is
i
do
know
the
sergeant
admitted
it
could
be
a
bobcat
canada
lynx
jink
here
has
a
theory
that
it
some
escapee
from
the
factory
with
a
machete
me
i
hope
not
but
i
not
ignoring
the
possibility
the
man
with
the
face
nodded
it
could
be
a
lynx
i
understand
they
not
unknown
in
this
section
we
paid
bounties
on
two
in
this
county
in
the
last
year
parker
said
odd
rifle
you
have
there
mind
if
i
look
at
it
not
at
all
the
man
who
had
been
introduced
as
richard
lee
unslung
and
handed
it
over
the
chamber
loaded
he
cautioned
i
never
saw
one
like
this
parker
said
foreign
i
think
so
i
do
know
anything
about
it
it
belongs
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
loaned
it
to
me
i
think
the
action
german
or
czech
the
rest
of
it
a
custom
job
by
some
west
coast
gunmaker
it
chambered
for
some
wildcat
load
the
rifle
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
three
men
examined
it
in
turn
commenting
admiringly
you
find
anything
mr
lee
the
sergeant
asked
handing
it
back
not
a
trace
the
man
called
lee
slung
the
rifle
and
began
to
dump
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
i
was
along
the
top
of
this
ridge
for
about
a
mile
on
either
side
of
the
gap
and
down
the
other
side
as
far
as
hindman
run
i
did
find
any
tracks
or
any
indication
of
where
it
had
made
a
kill
the
game
protector
nodded
turning
to
sergeant
haines
there
no
use
us
going
any
farther
he
said
ten
to
one
it
followed
that
line
of
woods
back
of
strawmyer
and
crossed
over
to
the
other
ridge
i
think
our
best
bet
would
be
the
hollow
at
the
head
of
run
what
do
you
think
the
sergeant
agreed
the
man
called
richard
lee
began
to
refill
his
pipe
methodically
i
think
i
shall
stay
here
for
a
while
but
i
believe
you
right
lowrie
run
or
across
lowrie
gap
into
coon
valley
he
said
after
parker
and
the
state
policemen
had
gone
the
man
whom
they
had
addressed
as
richard
lee
returned
to
his
log
and
sat
smoking
his
rifle
across
his
knees
from
time
to
time
he
glanced
at
his
wrist
watch
and
raised
his
head
to
listen
at
length
faint
in
the
distance
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
motor
starting
instantly
he
was
on
his
feet
from
the
end
of
the
hollow
log
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
he
produced
a
canvas
walking
briskly
to
a
patch
of
damp
ground
beside
the
little
stream
he
leaned
the
rifle
against
a
tree
and
opened
the
bag
first
he
took
out
a
pair
of
gloves
of
some
greenish
rubberlike
substance
and
put
them
on
drawing
the
long
gauntlets
up
over
his
coat
sleeves
then
he
produced
a
bottle
and
unscrewed
the
cap
being
careful
to
avoid
splashing
his
clothes
he
went
about
pouring
a
clear
liquid
upon
the
ground
in
several
places
where
he
poured
white
vapors
rose
and
twigs
and
grass
grumbled
into
brownish
dust
after
he
had
replaced
the
cap
and
returned
the
bottle
to
the
bag
he
waited
for
a
few
minutes
then
took
a
spatula
from
the
musette
and
dug
where
he
had
poured
the
fluid
prying
loose
four
black
lumps
of
matter
which
he
carried
to
the
running
water
and
washed
carefully
before
wrapping
them
and
putting
them
in
the
bag
along
with
the
gloves
then
he
slung
bag
and
rifle
and
started
down
the
trail
to
where
he
had
parked
the
jeep
half
an
hour
later
after
driving
through
the
little
farming
village
of
rutter
fort
he
pulled
into
the
barnyard
of
a
rundown
farm
and
backed
through
the
open
doors
of
the
barn
he
closed
the
double
doors
behind
him
and
barred
them
from
within
then
he
went
to
the
rear
wall
of
the
barn
which
was
much
closer
the
front
than
the
outside
dimensions
of
the
barn
would
have
indicated
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
black
object
like
an
automatic
pencil
hunting
over
the
rough
plank
wall
he
found
a
small
hole
and
inserted
the
pointed
end
of
the
pressing
on
the
other
end
for
an
instant
nothing
happened
then
a
section
of
the
wall
receded
two
feet
and
slid
noiselessly
to
one
side
the
section
which
had
slid
inward
had
been
built
of
steel
masked
by
a
thin
covering
of
boards
the
wall
around
it
was
concrete
similarly
camouflaged
he
stepped
quickly
inside
fumbling
at
the
right
side
of
the
opening
he
found
a
switch
and
flicked
it
instantly
the
massive
steel
plate
slid
back
into
place
with
a
soft
oily
click
as
it
did
lights
came
on
within
the
hidden
room
disclosing
a
great
semiglobe
of
some
fine
metallic
mesh
thirty
feet
in
diameter
and
fifteen
in
height
there
was
a
sliding
door
at
one
side
of
this
the
man
called
richard
lee
opened
and
entered
through
it
closing
it
behind
him
then
he
turned
to
the
center
of
the
hollow
dome
where
an
armchair
was
placed
in
front
of
a
small
desk
below
a
large
instrument
panel
the
gauges
and
dials
on
the
panel
and
the
levers
and
switches
and
buttons
on
the
desk
control
board
were
all
lettered
and
numbered
with
characters
not
of
the
roman
alphabet
or
the
arabic
notation
and
within
instant
reach
of
the
occupant
of
the
chair
a
pistollike
weapon
lay
on
the
desk
it
had
a
conventional
trigger
and
a
grip
but
instead
of
a
tubular
barrel
two
slender
parallel
metal
rods
extended
about
four
inches
forward
of
the
receiver
joined
together
at
what
would
correspond
to
the
muzzle
by
a
streamlined
knob
of
some
light
blue
ceramic
or
plastic
substance
the
man
with
the
handsome
immobile
face
deposited
his
rifle
and
musette
on
the
floor
beside
the
chair
and
sat
down
first
he
picked
up
the
pistollike
weapon
and
checked
it
and
then
he
examined
the
many
instruments
on
the
panel
in
front
of
him
finally
he
flicked
a
switch
on
the
control
board
at
once
a
small
humming
began
from
some
point
overhead
it
wavered
and
shrilled
and
mounted
in
intensity
and
then
fell
to
a
steady
monotone
the
dome
about
him
flickered
with
a
queer
cold
iridescence
and
slowly
vanished
the
hidden
room
vanished
and
he
was
looking
into
the
shadowy
interior
of
a
deserted
barn
the
barn
vanished
blue
sky
appeared
above
streaked
with
wisps
of
high
cirrus
cloud
the
autumn
landscape
flickered
unreally
buildings
appeared
and
vanished
and
other
buildings
came
and
went
in
a
twinkling
all
around
him
shapes
moved
briefly
and
disappeared
once
the
figure
of
a
man
appeared
inside
the
circle
of
the
dome
he
had
an
angry
brutal
face
and
he
wore
a
black
tunic
piped
with
silver
and
black
breeches
and
polished
black
boots
and
there
was
an
insignia
composed
of
a
cross
and
thunderbolt
on
his
cap
he
held
an
automatic
pistol
in
his
hand
instantly
the
man
at
the
desk
snatched
up
his
own
weapon
and
thumbed
off
the
safety
but
before
he
could
lift
and
aim
it
the
intruder
stumbled
and
passed
outside
the
which
surrounded
the
chair
and
instruments
for
a
while
there
were
fires
raging
outside
and
for
a
while
the
man
at
the
desk
was
surrounded
by
a
great
hall
with
a
high
vaulted
ceiling
through
which
figures
flitted
and
vanished
for
a
while
there
were
vistas
of
deep
forests
always
set
in
the
same
background
of
mountains
and
always
under
the
same
blue
sky
there
was
an
interval
of
flickering
light
of
unbearable
intensity
then
the
man
at
the
desk
was
surrounded
by
the
interior
of
vast
industrial
works
the
moving
figures
around
him
slowed
and
became
more
distinct
for
an
instant
the
man
in
the
chair
grinned
as
he
found
himself
looking
into
a
big
washroom
where
a
tall
blond
girl
was
taking
a
shower
bath
and
a
pert
little
redhead
was
vigorously
drying
herself
with
a
towel
the
dome
grew
visible
coruscating
with
lights
and
then
the
humming
died
and
the
dome
became
a
cold
and
inert
mesh
of
fine
white
metal
a
green
light
above
flashed
on
and
off
slowly
he
stabbed
a
button
and
flipped
a
switch
then
got
to
his
feet
picking
up
his
rifle
and
musette
and
fumbling
under
his
shirt
for
a
small
mesh
bag
from
which
he
took
an
disk
of
blue
plastic
unlocking
a
container
on
the
instrument
panel
he
removed
a
small
roll
of
which
he
stowed
in
his
bag
then
he
slid
open
the
door
and
emerged
into
his
own
dimension
of
outside
was
a
wide
hallway
with
a
pale
green
floor
paler
green
walls
and
a
ceiling
of
greenish
a
big
hole
had
been
cut
to
accommodate
the
dome
and
across
the
hallway
a
desk
had
been
set
up
and
at
it
sat
a
clerk
in
a
pale
blue
tunic
who
was
just
taking
the
of
a
out
of
his
ears
a
couple
of
policemen
in
green
uniforms
with
ultrasonic
paralyzers
dangling
by
thongs
from
their
left
wrists
and
bolstered
needlers
like
the
one
on
the
desk
inside
the
dome
were
kidding
with
some
girls
in
vivid
orange
and
scarlet
and
green
smocks
one
of
these
in
bright
green
was
a
duplicate
of
the
one
he
had
seen
rubbing
herself
down
with
a
towel
here
comes
your
one
of
the
girls
told
the
cops
as
he
approached
they
both
turned
and
saluted
casually
the
man
who
had
lately
been
using
the
name
of
richard
lee
responded
to
their
greeting
and
went
to
the
desk
the
policemen
grasped
their
paralyzers
drew
their
needlers
and
hurried
into
the
dome
taking
the
disk
of
blue
plastic
from
his
packet
he
handed
it
to
the
clerk
at
the
desk
who
dropped
it
into
a
slot
in
the
voder
in
front
of
him
instantly
a
mechanical
voice
responded
verkan
vall
noble
hereditary
mavrad
of
nerros
special
chief
assistant
paratime
police
special
assignment
subject
to
no
orders
below
those
of
tortha
karf
chief
of
paratime
police
to
be
given
all
courtesies
and
within
the
paratime
transposition
code
and
the
police
powers
code
further
particulars
the
clerk
pressed
the
no
the
blue
sigil
fell
out
the
and
was
handed
back
to
its
bearer
who
was
drawing
up
his
left
sleeve
you
want
to
be
sure
i
verkan
vall
i
suppose
he
said
extending
his
arm
yes
quite
sir
the
clerk
touched
his
arm
with
a
small
instrument
which
swabbed
it
with
antiseptic
drew
a
minute
and
medicated
the
needle
prick
all
in
one
almost
painless
operation
he
put
the
on
a
slide
and
inserted
it
at
one
side
of
a
comparison
microscope
nodding
it
showed
the
same
distinctive
permanent
colloid
pattern
as
the
sample
he
had
ready
for
comparison
the
colloid
pattern
given
in
infancy
by
injection
to
the
man
in
front
of
him
to
set
him
apart
from
all
the
myriad
other
verkan
valls
on
every
other
of
paratime
right
sir
the
clerk
nodded
the
two
policemen
came
out
of
the
dome
their
needlers
holstered
and
their
vigilance
relaxed
they
were
lighting
cigarettes
as
they
emerged
it
all
right
sir
one
of
them
said
you
did
bring
anything
in
with
you
this
trip
the
other
cop
chuckled
remember
that
fifth
level
who
came
in
on
the
freight
conveyor
at
jandar
last
month
he
asked
if
he
was
hoping
that
some
of
the
girls
would
want
to
know
what
it
was
a
vain
hope
with
a
mavrad
around
what
chance
did
a
couple
of
ordinary
coppers
have
the
girls
were
already
converging
on
verkan
vall
when
are
you
going
to
get
that
monstrosity
out
of
our
restroom
the
little
redhead
in
green
coveralls
was
demanding
if
it
was
for
that
thing
i
be
taking
a
shower
right
now
you
were
just
finishing
one
about
fifty
paraseconds
off
when
i
came
through
verkan
vall
told
her
the
girl
looked
at
him
in
obviously
feigned
indignation
why
you
you
verkan
vall
chuckled
and
turned
to
the
clerk
i
want
a
and
pilot
for
dhergabar
right
away
call
dhergabar
paratime
police
field
and
give
them
my
eta
have
an
meet
me
and
have
the
chief
notified
that
i
coming
in
extraordinary
report
keep
a
guard
over
the
conveyor
i
think
i
going
to
need
it
again
soon
he
turned
to
the
little
redhead
want
to
show
me
the
way
out
of
here
to
the
rocket
field
he
asked
illustration
outside
on
the
open
landing
field
verkan
vall
glanced
up
at
the
sky
then
looked
at
his
watch
it
had
been
twenty
minutes
since
he
had
backed
the
jeep
into
the
barn
on
that
distant
other
the
same
delicate
lines
of
white
cirrus
were
etched
across
the
blue
above
the
constancy
of
the
weather
even
across
two
hundred
thousand
parayears
of
perpendicular
time
never
failed
to
impress
him
the
long
curve
of
the
mountains
was
the
same
and
they
were
mottled
with
the
same
autumn
colors
but
where
the
little
village
of
rutter
fort
stood
on
that
other
line
of
probability
the
white
towers
of
an
rose
the
living
quarters
of
the
plant
personnel
the
rocket
that
was
to
take
him
to
headquarters
was
being
hoisted
with
a
crane
and
lowered
into
the
and
he
walked
briskly
toward
it
his
rifle
and
musette
slung
a
pilot
was
on
the
platform
opening
the
door
of
the
rocket
he
stood
aside
for
verkan
vall
to
enter
then
followed
and
closed
it
dogging
it
shut
while
his
passenger
stowed
his
bag
and
rifle
and
strapped
himself
into
a
seat
dhergabar
commercial
terminal
sir
the
pilot
asked
taking
the
adjoining
seat
at
the
controls
paratime
police
field
back
of
the
paratime
administration
building
right
sir
twenty
seconds
to
blast
when
you
ready
ready
now
verkan
vall
relaxed
counting
seconds
subconsciously
the
rocket
trembled
and
verkan
vall
felt
himself
being
pushed
gently
back
against
the
upholstery
the
seats
and
the
pilot
instrument
panel
in
front
of
them
swung
on
gimbals
and
the
finger
of
the
indicator
swept
slowly
over
a
arc
as
the
rocket
rose
and
leveled
by
then
the
high
cirrus
clouds
verkan
vall
had
watched
from
the
field
were
far
below
they
were
well
into
the
stratosphere
there
would
be
nothing
to
do
now
for
the
three
hours
in
which
the
rocket
sped
northward
across
the
pole
and
southward
to
dhergabar
the
navigation
was
entirely
in
the
electronic
hands
of
the
robot
controls
verkan
vall
got
out
his
pipe
and
lit
it
the
pilot
lit
a
cigarette
that
an
odd
pipe
sir
the
pilot
said
item
yes
fourth
probability
level
typical
of
the
whole
paratime
belt
i
was
working
in
verkan
vall
handed
it
over
for
inspection
the
natural
the
stem
a
sort
of
plastic
made
from
the
sap
of
certain
tropical
trees
the
little
white
dot
is
the
maker
trademark
it
made
of
elephant
tusk
sounds
pretty
crude
to
me
sir
the
pilot
handed
it
back
nice
workmanship
though
looks
like
good
machine
production
yes
the
sector
i
was
on
is
really
quite
advanced
for
an
civilization
that
weapon
i
brought
back
with
me
that
projector
is
typical
of
most
fourth
level
culture
moving
parts
machined
to
the
closest
tolerances
and
interchangeable
with
similar
parts
of
all
similar
weapons
the
missile
is
a
small
bolt
of
coated
lead
propelled
by
expanding
gases
from
the
ignition
of
some
compound
most
of
their
scientific
advance
occurred
within
the
past
century
and
most
of
that
in
the
past
forty
years
of
course
the
on
that
level
is
only
about
seventy
years
humph
i
last
birthday
the
pilot
snorted
their
medical
science
must
be
mostly
witchcraft
until
quite
recently
it
was
verkan
vall
agreed
same
story
there
as
in
everything
else
rapid
advancement
in
the
past
few
decades
after
thousands
of
years
of
cultural
inertia
you
know
sir
i
do
really
understand
this
paratime
stuff
the
pilot
confessed
i
know
that
all
time
is
totally
present
and
that
every
moment
has
its
own
line
of
and
that
all
events
in
occur
according
to
maximum
probability
but
i
just
do
get
this
alternate
probability
stuff
at
all
if
something
exists
it
because
it
the
effect
of
prior
causes
why
does
anything
else
exist
on
any
other
verkan
vall
blew
smoke
at
the
a
lecture
on
paratime
theory
would
nicely
fill
in
the
interval
until
the
landing
at
dhergabar
at
least
this
kid
was
asking
intelligent
questions
well
you
know
the
principal
of
i
suppose
he
began
yes
of
course
rhogom
doctrine
the
basis
of
most
of
our
psychical
science
we
exist
perpetually
at
all
moments
within
our
our
extraphysical
ego
component
passes
from
the
ego
existing
at
one
moment
to
the
ego
existing
at
the
next
during
unconsciousness
the
epc
is
it
may
detach
and
connect
at
some
other
moment
with
the
ego
existing
at
that
that
how
we
precog
we
take
an
autohypno
and
recover
memories
brought
back
from
the
future
moment
and
buried
in
the
subconscious
mind
that
right
verkan
vall
told
him
and
even
without
the
autohypno
a
lot
of
precognitive
matter
leaks
out
of
the
subconscious
and
into
the
conscious
mind
usually
in
distorted
forms
or
else
inspires
acts
the
motivation
for
which
is
not
brought
to
the
level
of
consciousness
for
instance
suppose
you
walking
along
north
promenade
in
dhergabar
and
you
come
to
the
martian
palace
café
and
you
go
in
for
a
drink
and
meet
some
girl
and
strike
up
an
acquaintance
with
her
this
chance
acquaintance
develops
into
a
love
affair
and
a
year
later
out
of
jealousy
she
rays
you
half
a
dozen
times
with
a
needler
just
about
that
happened
to
a
friend
of
mine
not
long
ago
the
pilot
said
go
on
sir
well
in
the
microsecond
or
so
before
you
die
or
afterward
for
that
matter
because
we
know
that
the
extraphysical
component
survives
physical
destruction
your
epc
slips
back
a
couple
of
years
and
at
some
point
pastward
of
your
first
meeting
with
this
girl
and
carries
with
it
memories
of
everything
up
to
the
moment
of
detachment
all
of
which
are
indelibly
recorded
in
your
subconscious
mind
so
when
you
the
event
of
standing
outside
the
martian
palace
with
a
thirst
you
go
on
to
the
starway
or
nhergal
or
some
other
bar
in
both
cases
on
both
you
follow
the
line
of
maximum
probability
in
the
second
case
your
subconscious
future
memories
are
an
added
causal
factor
and
when
i
after
i
been
needled
i
generate
a
new
is
that
it
verkan
vall
made
a
small
sound
of
impatience
no
such
thing
he
exclaimed
it
semantically
inadmissible
to
talk
about
the
total
presence
of
time
with
one
breath
and
about
generating
new
with
the
next
are
totally
present
in
perpetual
the
theory
is
that
the
epc
passes
from
one
moment
on
one
to
the
next
moment
on
the
next
line
so
that
the
true
passage
of
the
epc
from
moment
to
moment
is
a
diagonal
so
in
the
case
we
using
the
event
of
your
going
into
the
martian
palace
exists
on
one
and
the
event
of
your
passing
along
to
the
starway
exists
on
another
but
both
are
events
in
real
existence
now
what
we
do
in
paratime
transposition
is
to
build
up
a
hypertemporal
field
to
include
the
we
want
to
reach
and
then
shift
over
to
it
same
point
in
the
plenum
same
point
in
primary
time
plus
primary
time
elapsed
during
mechanical
and
electronic
lag
in
the
relays
but
a
different
line
of
secondary
time
then
why
do
we
have
time
travel
on
our
own
the
pilot
wanted
to
know
that
was
a
question
every
paratimer
has
to
answer
every
time
he
talks
paratime
to
the
laity
verkan
vall
had
been
expecting
it
he
answered
patiently
the
is
like
every
other
mechanism
it
can
operate
only
in
the
area
of
primary
time
in
which
it
exists
it
can
transpose
to
any
other
and
carry
with
it
anything
inside
its
field
but
it
ca
go
outside
its
own
temporal
area
of
existence
any
more
than
a
bullet
from
that
rifle
can
hit
the
target
a
week
before
fired
verkan
vall
pointed
out
anything
inside
the
field
is
supposed
to
be
unaffected
by
anything
outside
to
is
the
way
to
put
it
it
does
always
work
once
in
a
while
something
pretty
nasty
gets
picked
up
in
transit
he
thought
briefly
of
the
man
in
the
black
tunic
that
why
we
have
armed
guards
at
terminals
suppose
you
pick
up
a
blast
from
a
nucleonic
bomb
the
pilot
asked
or
something
or
radioactive
we
have
a
monument
at
paratime
police
headquarters
in
dhergabar
bearing
the
names
of
our
own
personnel
who
did
make
it
back
it
a
large
monument
over
the
past
ten
thousand
years
it
been
inscribed
with
quite
a
few
names
you
can
have
it
i
stick
to
rockets
the
pilot
replied
tell
me
another
thing
though
what
all
this
about
levels
and
sectors
and
belts
what
the
difference
purely
arbitrary
terms
there
are
five
main
probability
levels
derived
from
the
five
possible
outcomes
of
the
attempt
to
colonize
this
planet
thousand
years
ago
we
on
the
first
level
complete
success
and
colony
fully
established
the
fifth
level
is
the
probability
of
complete
failure
no
human
population
established
on
this
planet
and
indigenous
life
evolved
indigenously
on
the
fourth
level
the
colonists
evidently
met
with
some
disaster
and
lost
all
memory
of
their
extraterrestrial
origin
as
well
as
all
extraterrestrial
culture
as
far
as
they
know
they
are
an
indigenous
race
they
have
a
long
of
savagery
sectors
are
areas
of
paratime
on
any
level
in
which
the
prevalent
culture
has
a
common
origin
and
common
characteristics
they
are
divided
more
or
less
arbitrarily
into
belts
are
areas
within
where
conditions
are
the
result
of
recent
alternate
probabilities
for
instance
i
just
come
from
the
sector
of
the
fourth
level
an
area
of
about
ten
thousand
parayears
in
depth
in
which
the
dominant
civilization
developed
on
the
continent
of
the
major
land
mass
and
spread
from
there
to
the
minor
land
mass
the
line
on
which
i
was
operating
is
also
part
of
a
of
about
three
thousand
parayears
depth
and
a
belt
developing
from
one
of
several
probable
outcomes
of
a
war
concluded
about
three
elapsed
years
ago
on
that
the
field
at
the
hagraban
synthetics
works
where
we
took
off
is
part
of
an
abandoned
farm
on
the
site
of
hagraban
city
is
a
little
farming
village
those
things
are
there
right
now
both
in
primary
time
and
in
the
plenum
they
are
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
parayears
perpendicular
to
each
other
and
each
is
of
the
same
general
order
of
reality
the
red
light
overhead
flashed
on
the
pilot
looked
into
his
visor
and
put
his
hands
to
the
manual
controls
in
case
of
failure
of
the
robot
controls
the
rocket
landed
smoothly
however
there
was
a
slight
jar
as
it
was
grappled
by
the
crane
and
hoisted
upright
the
seats
turning
in
their
gimbals
pilot
and
passenger
unstrapped
themselves
and
hurried
through
the
refrigerated
outlet
and
away
from
the
rocket
an
emblazoned
with
the
device
of
the
paratime
police
was
waiting
verkan
vall
said
to
the
and
took
his
seat
beside
the
pilot
of
the
aircab
the
latter
lifted
his
vehicle
above
the
building
level
and
then
set
it
down
on
the
of
the
paratime
police
building
in
a
long
glide
an
express
elevator
took
verkan
vall
down
to
one
of
the
middle
stages
where
he
showed
his
sigil
to
the
guard
outside
the
door
of
tortha
karf
office
and
was
admitted
at
once
the
paratime
police
chief
rose
from
behind
his
semicircular
desk
with
its
array
of
keyboards
and
and
communicators
he
was
a
big
man
well
past
his
two
hundredth
year
his
hair
was
and
thinning
in
front
he
had
begun
to
grow
thick
at
the
waist
and
his
calm
features
bore
the
lines
of
middle
age
he
wore
the
uniform
of
the
paratime
police
well
vall
he
greeted
everything
secure
not
exactly
sir
verkan
vall
came
around
the
desk
deposited
his
rifle
and
bag
on
the
floor
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
spare
chairs
i
have
to
go
back
again
so
his
chief
lit
a
cigarette
and
waited
i

out
his
pipe
and
began
to
fill
it

that
only
the
beginning
i
have
to
trace
something
else
gavran
sarn
exceeded
his
paratime
permit
and
took
one
of
his
pets
along
a
venusian
nighthound
tortha
karf
expression
did
not
alter
it
merely
grew
more
intense
he
used
one
of
the
short
semantically
ugly
terms
which
serve
in
place
of
profanity
as
the
emotional
release
of
a
race
that
has
forgotten
all
the
taboos
and
terminologies
of
supernaturalistic
religion
and
you
sure
of
this
of
course
it
was
less
a
question
than
a
statement
verkan
vall
bent
and
took
objects
from
his
bag
unwrapping
them
and
laying
them
on
the
desk
they
were
casts
in
hard
black
plastic
of
the
footprints
of
some
large
animal
what
do
these
look
like
sir
he
asked
tortha
karf
fingered
them
and
nodded
then
he
became
as
visibly
angry
as
a
man
of
his
civilization
and
ever
permitted
himself
what
does
that
fool
think
we
have
a
paratime
code
for
he
demanded
it
entirely
illegal
to
transpose
any
extraterrestrial
animal
or
object
to
any
on
which
is
unknown
i
do
care
if
he
is
a
thavrad
he
face
charges
when
he
gets
back
for
this
he
a
thavrad
verkan
vall
corrected
and
he
wo
be
coming
back
i
hope
you
did
have
to
deal
summarily
with
him
tortha
karf
said
with
his
title
and
social
position
and
his
family
political
importance
that
might
make
difficulties
not
that
it
would
be
all
right
with
me
of
course
but
we
never
seem
to
be
able
to
make
either
the
management
or
the
public
realize
the
extremities
to
which
we
are
forced
at
times
he
sighed
we
probably
never
shall
verkan
vall
smiled
faintly
oh
no
sir
nothing
like
that
he
was
dead
before
i
transposed
to
that
he
was
killed
when
he
wrecked
a
vehicle
he
was
using
one
of
those
fourth
level
automobiles
i
posed
as
a
relative
and
tried
to
claim
his
body
for
the
observed
on
that
cultural
level
but
was
told
that
it
had
been
completely
destroyed
by
fire
when
the
fuel
tank
of
this
automobile
burned
i
was
given
certain
of
his
effects
which
had
passed
through
the
fire
i
found
his
sigil
concealed
inside
what
appeared
to
be
a
cigarette
case
he
took
a
green
disk
from
the
bag
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
there
no
question
gavran
sarn
died
in
the
wreck
of
that
automobile
and
the
nighthound
it
was
in
the
car
with
him
but
it
escaped
you
know
how
fast
those
things
are
i
found
that
track
he
indicated
one
of
the
black
casts
in
some
dried
mud
near
the
scene
of
the
wreck
as
you
see
the
cast
is
slightly
defective
the
others
were
fresh
this
morning
when
i
made
them
and
what
have
you
done
so
far
i
rented
an
old
farm
near
the
scene
of
the
wreck
and
installed
my
there
it
runs
through
to
the
hagraban
synthetics
works
about
a
hundred
miles
east
of
i
have
my
terminal
in
the
girls
rest
room
at
the
durable
plastics
factory
handled
that
on
a
local
writ
since
then
i
been
hunting
for
the
nighthound
i
think
i
can
find
it
but
i
need
some
special
equipment
and
a
indoctrination
that
why
i
came
back
has
it
been
attracting
any
attention
tortha
karf
asked
anxiously
killing
cattle
in
the
locality
causing
considerable
excitement
fortunately
it
a
locality
of
forested
mountains
and
valley
farms
rather
than
a
industrial
district
local
police
and
protection
officers
are
concerned
all
the
farmers
excited
and
going
armed
the
theory
is
that
it
either
a
wildcat
of
some
sort
or
a
maniac
armed
with
a
cutlass
either
theory
would
conform
more
or
less
to
the
nature
of
its
depredations
nobody
has
actually
seen
it
that
good
tortha
karf
was
relieved
well
you
have
to
go
and
bring
it
out
or
kill
it
and
obliterate
the
body
you
know
why
as
well
as
i
do
certainly
sir
verkan
vall
replied
in
a
primitive
culture
things
like
this
would
be
assigned
supernatural
explanations
and
imbedded
in
the
locally
accepted
religion
but
this
culture
while
nominally
religious
is
highly
rationalistic
in
practice
typical
characteristic
of
all
expanding
cultures
and
this
sector
really
has
an
expanding
culture
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
the
inhabitants
of
this
particular
did
even
know
how
to
apply
steam
power
now
they
begun
to
release
nuclear
energy
in
a
few
crude
forms
tortha
karf
whistled
softly
that
quite
a
jump
there
a
sector
that
be
in
for
trouble
in
the
next
few
centuries
that
is
realized
locally
sir
verkan
vall
concentrated
on
relighting
his
pipe
for
a
moment
then
continued
i
would
predict
on
that
sector
within
the
next
century
maybe
the
next
at
least
to
the
moon
and
the
art
of
taxidermy
is
very
highly
developed
now
suppose
some
farmer
shoots
that
thing
what
would
he
do
with
it
sir
tortha
karf
grunted
nice
logic
vall
on
a
most
uncomfortable
possibility
he
have
it
mounted
and
it
be
put
in
a
museum
somewhere
and
as
soon
as
the
first
spaceship
reaches
venus
and
they
find
those
things
in
a
wild
state
they
have
the
mounted
specimen
identified
exactly
and
then
instead
of
beating
their
brains
about
their
specimen
came
from
they
begin
asking
it
came
from
they
quite
capable
of
such
reasoning
even
now
a
hundred
years
is
a
particularly
long
time
tortha
karf
considered
i
be
retired
then
but
you
have
my
job
and
be
your
headache
you
better
get
this
cleaned
up
now
while
it
can
be
handled
what
are
you
going
to
do
illustration
i
not
sure
now
sir
i
want
a
indoctrination
first
verkan

gestured
toward
the

on

he
asked
certainly
tortha

slid
the

across
the
desk
anything
you
want
thank
you

snapped
on

he
wanted

then
punched

the

special

verkan

he
identified
himself
speaking
from

i

he
turned
to
tortha

can
i
take
it
here
tortha
karf
nodded
pointing
to
a
row
of
booths
along
the
far
wall
of
the
office
make
for
wired
transmission
i
take
it
here
very
well
sir
in
fifteen
minutes
a
voice
replied
out
of
the
communicator
verkan
vall
slid
the
communicator
back
by
the
way
sir
i
had
a
hitchhiker
on
the
way
back
carried
him
about
a
hundred
or
so
parayears
picked
him
up
about
three
hundred
parayears
after
leaving
my
terminal
fellow
in
a
black
uniform
looked
like
one
of
these
storm
troopers
you
find
all
through
that
sector
armed
and
hostile
i
thought
i
have
to
ray
him
but
he
blundered
outside
the
field
almost
at
once
i
have
a
record
if
you
care
to
see
it
yes
put
it
on
tortha
karf
gestured
toward
the
it
set
for
miniature
reproduction
here
on
the
desk
that
be
all
right
verkan
vall
nodded
getting
out
the
film
and
loading
it
into
the
projector
when
he
pressed
a
button
a
dome
of
radiance
appeared
on
the
desk
top
two
feet
in
width
and
a
foot
in
height
in
the
middle
of
this
appeared
a
small
solidograph
image
of
the
interior
of
the
conveyor
showing
the
desk
and
the
control
board
and
the
figure
of
verkan
vall
seated
at
it
the
little
figure
of
the
storm
trooper
appeared
pistol
in
hand
the
little
verkan
vall
snatched
up
his
tiny
needler
the
storm
trooper
moved
into
one
side
of
the
dome
and
vanished
verkan
vall
flipped
a
switch
and
cut
out
the
image
yes
i
do
know
what
causes
that
but
it
happens
now
and
then
tortha
karf
said
usually
at
the
beginning
of
a
transposition
i
remember
when
i
was
just
a
kid
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
a
hundred
and
to
be
exact
i
picked
up
a
fellow
on
the
fourth
level
just
about
where
you
operating
and
dragged
him
a
couple
of
hundred
parayears
i
went
back
to
find
him
and
return
him
to
his
own
but
before
i
could
locate
him
he
been
arrested
by
the
local
authorities
as
a
suspicious
character
and
got
himself
shot
trying
to
escape
i
felt
badly
about
that
but
tortha
karf
shrugged
anything
else
happen
on
the
trip
i
ran
through
a
belt
of
intermittent
nucleonic
bombing
on
the
second
level
verkan
vall
mentioned
an
approximate
paratime
location
aaagh
that
khiftan
civilization
by
courtesy
so
called
tortha
karf
pulled
a
wry
face
i
suppose
the
enmities
of
the
hvadka
dynasty
have
reached
critical
mass
again
they
fool
around
till
they
blast
themselves
back
to
the
stone
age
intellectually
they
about
there
now
i
had
to
operate
in
that
sector
once
oh
yes
another
thing
sir
this
rifle
verkan
vall
picked
it
up
emptied
the
magazine
and
handed
it
to
his
superior
the
supplies
office
slipped
up
on
this
it
not
appropriate
to
my
line
of
operation
it
a
lovely
rifle
but
it
about
two
hundred
percent
in
advance
of
existing
arms
design
on
my
line
it
excited
the
curiosity
of
a
couple
of
police
officers
and
a
who
should
be
familiar
with
the
weapons
of
their
own
i
evaded
by
disclaiming
ownership
or
intimate
knowledge
and
they
seemed
satisfied
but
it
worried
me
yes
that
was
made
in
our
duplicating
shops
here
in
dhergabar
tortha
karf
carried
it
to
a
photographic
bench
behind
his
desk
i
have
it
checked
while
you
taking
your
want
to
exchange
it
for
something
authentic
why
no
sir
it
been
identified
to
me
and
i
excite
less
suspicion
with
it
than
i
would
if
i
abandoned
it
and
mysteriously
acquired
another
rifle
i
just
wanted
a
check
and
supplies
warned
to
be
more
careful
in
future
tortha
karf
nodded
approvingly
the
young
mavrad
of
nerros
was
thinking
as
a
paratimer
should
what
the
designation
of
your
line
again
verkan
vall
told
him
it
was
a
short
numerical
term
of
six
places
but
it
expressed
a
number
of
the
order
of
ten
to
the
fortieth
power
exact
to
the
last
digit
tortha
karf
repeated
it
into
his
stenomemograph
with
explanatory
comment
there
seems
to
be
quite
a
few
things
going
wrong
in
that
area
he
said
let
see
now
he
punched
the
designation
on
a
keyboard
instantly
it
appeared
on
a
translucent
screen
in
front
of
him
he
punched
another
combination
and
at
the
top
of
the
screen
under
the
number
there
appeared
events
past
elapsed
five
years
he
punched
again
below
this
line
appeared
the
events
involving
paratime
transposition
another
added
a
third
line
attracting
public
notice
among
inhabitants
he
pressed
the
start
the
headings
vanished
to
be
replaced
by
page
after
page
of
print
succeeding
one
another
on
the
screen
as
the
two
men
read
they
told
strange
and
apparently
disconnected
stories
of
unexplained
fires
and
explosions
of
people
vanishing
without
trace
of
unaccountable
disasters
to
aircraft
there
were
many
stories
of
an
epidemic
of
mysterious
objects
seen
in
the
sky
singly
or
in
numbers
to
each
account
was
appended
one
or
more
sometimes
tortha
karf
or
verkan
vall
would
punch
one
of
these
and
read
on
an
adjoining
screen
the
explanatory
matter
referred
to
finally
tortha
karf
leaned
back
and
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
yes
indeed
vall
very
definitely
we
will
have
to
take
action
in
the
matter
of
the
runaway
nighthound
of
the
late
gavran
sarn
he
said
i
forgotten
that
that
was
the
onto
which
the
expedition
launched
those
antigrav
disks
if
this
extraterrestrial
monstrosity
turns
up
on
the
heels
of
that
saucer
business
everybody
above
the
order
of
intelligence
of
a
cretin
will
suspect
some
connection
what
really
happened
in
the
matter
verkan
vall
inquired
i
was
on
the
third
level
on
that
luvarian
empire
operation
at
the
time
that
right
you
missed
that
well
it
was
one
of
these
things
the
paratime
commission
and
the
space
patrol
were
experimenting
with
a
new
technique
for
throwing
a
spaceship
into
paratime
they
used
the
cruiser
kalzarn
jann
commanding
went
into
space
about
halfway
to
the
moon
and
took
up
orbit
keeping
on
the
sunlit
side
of
the
planet
to
avoid
being
observed
that
was
all
right
but
then
captain
kalzarn
ordered
away
a
flight
of
antigrav
disks
fully
manned
to
take
pictures
and
finally
authorized
a
landing
in
the
western
mountain
range
northern
continent
minor
when
the
trouble
started
he
flipped
the
switch
till
he
had
recovered
the
page
he
wanted
verkan
vall
read
of
a
fourth
level
aviator
in
his
little
craft
sighting
nine
saucerlike
objects
that
was
how
it
began
tortha
karf
told
him
before
long
as
other
incidents
of
the
same
sort
occurred
our
people
on
that
line
began
sending
back
to
know
what
was
going
on
naturally
from
the
different
descriptions
of
these
they
recognized
the
objects
as
antigrav
from
a
spaceship
so
i
went
to
the
commission
and
raised
atomic
blazes
about
it
and
the
was
ordered
to
confine
operations
to
the
lower
areas
of
the
fifth
level
then
our
people
on
that
went
to
work
with
corrective
action
here
he
wiped
the
screen
and
then
began
punching
combinations
page
after
page
appeared
bearing
accounts
of
people
who
had
claimed
to
have
seen
the
mysterious
disks
and
each
report
was
more
fantastic
than
the
last
the
standard
technique
verkan
vall
grinned
i
only
heard
a
little
talk
about
the
saucers
and
all
of
that
was
in
joke
in
that
order
of
culture
you
can
always
discredit
one
true
story
by
setting
up
ten
others
palpably
false
parallel
to
it
was
that
the
the
tharmax
trading
corporation
almost
lost
their
paratime
license
on
that
right
it
was
they
bought
up
all
the
cigarettes
and
caused
a
conspicuous
shortage
after
fourth
level
cigarettes
had
been
introduced
on
this
line
and
had
become
popular
they
should
have
spread
their
purchases
over
a
number
of
lines
and
kept
them
within
the
local
frame
and
they
also
got
into
trouble
with
the
local
government
for
selling
unrationed
petrol
and
automobile
tires
we
had
to
send
in
a
group
and
they
came
closer
to
having
to
engage
in
local
politics
than
i
care
to
think
of
tortha
karf
quoted
a
line
from
a
currently
popular
song
about
the
sorrows
of
a
policeman
life
we
jugglers
vall
trying
to
keep
our
traders
and
sociological
observers
and
tourists
and
plain
idiots
like
the
late
gavran
sarn
out
of
trouble
trying
to
prevent
panics
and
disturbances
and
dislocations
of
local
economy
as
a
result
of
our
operations
trying
to
keep
out
of
politics
and
at
all
times
at
all
costs
and
hazards
by
all
means
guarding
the
secret
of
paratime
transposition
sometimes
i
wish
ghaldron
karf

hesthor
ghrom
had
strangled
in
their
cradles
verkan
vall
shook
his
head
no
chief
he
said
you
do
mean
that
not
really
he
said
we
been
paratiming
for
the
past
ten
thousand
years
when
the
field
was
discovered
our
ancestors
had
pretty
well
exhausted
the
resources
of
this
planet
we
had
a
world
population
of
half
a
billion
and
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
keep
alive
after
we
began
paratime
transposition
our
population
climbed
to
ten
billion
and
there
it
stayed
for
the
last
eight
thousand
years
just
enough
of
us
to
enjoy
our
planet
and
the
other
planets
of
the
system
to
the
fullest
enough
of
everything
for
everybody
that
nobody
needs
fight
anybody
for
anything
we
tapped
the
resources
of
those
other
worlds
on
other
a
little
here
a
little
there
and
not
enough
to
really
hurt
anybody
we
left
our
mark
in
a
few
places
the
dakota
badlands
and
the
gobi
on
the
fourth
level
for
instance
but
we
done
no
great
damage
to
any
of
them
except
the
time
they
blew
up
half
the
southern
island
continent
over
about
five
hundred
parayears
on
the
third
level
tortha
karf
mentioned
regrettable
accident
to
be
sure
verkan
vall
conceded
and
look
how
much
we
learned
from
the
experiences
of
those
other
during
the
crisis
after
the
fourth
interplanetary
war
we
might
have
adopted
palnar
sarn
of
the
chosen
scheme
if
we
had
seen
what
an
exactly
similar
scheme
had
done
to
the
civilization
on
the
second
level
when
palnar
sarn
was
told
about
that
he
went
into
paratime
to
see
for
himself
and
when
he
returned
he
renounced
his
proposal
in
horror
tortha
karf
nodded
he
would
be
making
any
mistake
in
turning
his
post
over
to
the
mavrad
of
nerros
on
his
retirement
yes
vall
i
know
he
said
but
when
you
been
at
this
desk
as
long
as
i
have
you
have
a
sour
moment
or
two
now
and
then
too
a
blue
light
flashed
over
one
of
the
booths
across
the
room
verkan
vall
got
to
his
feet
removing
his
coat
and
hanging
it
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
crossed
the
room
rolling
up
his
left
shirt
sleeve
there
was
a
in
the
booth
with
a
blue
plastic
helmet
above
it
he
glanced
at
the
to
make
sure
he
was
getting
the
indoctrination
he
called
for
and
then
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
lowered
the
helmet
over
his
head
inserting
the
ear
plugs
and
fastening
the
chin
strap
then
he
touched
his
left
arm
with
an
injector
which
was
lying
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
at
the
same
time
flipped
the
starter
switch
soft
slow
music
began
to
chant
out
of
the
earphones
the
insidious
fingers
of
the
drug
blocked
off
his
senses
one
by
one
the
music
diminished
and
the
words
of
the
hypnotic
formula
lulled
him
to
sleep
he
woke
hearing
the
lively
strains
of
dance
music
for
a
while
he
lay
relaxed
then
he
snapped
off
the
switch
took
out
the
ear
plugs
removed
the
helmet
and
rose
to
his
feet
deep
in
his
subconscious
mind
was
the
entire
body
of
knowledge
about
the
venusian
nighthound
he
mentally
pronounced
the
word
and
at
once
it
began
flooding
into
his
conscious
mind
he
knew
the
animal
evolutionary
history
its
anatomy
its
characteristics
its
dietary
and
reproductive
habits
how
it
hunted
how
it
fought
its
enemies
how
it
eluded
pursuit
and
how
best
it
could
be
tracked
down
and
killed
he
nodded
already
a
plan
for
dealing
with
gavran
sarn
renegade
pet
was
taking
shape
in
his
mind
he
picked
a
plastic
cup
from
the
dispenser
filled
it
from
a
with
spiced
wine
and
drank
tossing
the
cup
into
the
he
placed
a
fresh
injector
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
ready
for
the
next
user
of
the
booth
then
he
emerged
glancing
at
his
fourth
level
wrist
watch
and
mentally
translating
to
the
first
level
three
hours
had
passed
there
had
been
more
to
learn
about
his
quarry
than
he
had
expected
tortha
karf
was
sitting
behind
his
desk
smoking
a
cigarette
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
not
moved
since
verkan
vall
had
left
him
though
the
special
agent
knew
that
he
had
dined
attended
several
conferences
and
done
many
other
things
i
checked
up
on
your
hitchhiker
vall
the
chief
said
we
bother
about
him
he
a
member
of
something
called
the
christian
avengers
one
of
those
typical
hate
groups
he
belongs
in
a
belt
that
is
the
outcome
of
the
hitler
victory
of
whatever
that
was
something
unpleasant
i
daresay
we
owe
him
anything
people
of
that
sort
should
be
stepped
on
like
cockroaches
and
he
wo
make
any
more
trouble
on
the
line
where
you
dropped
him
than
they
have
there
already
it
in
a
belt
of
complete
social
and
political
anarchy
somebody
probably
shot
him
as
soon
as
he
emerged
because
he
was
wearing
the
right
sort
of
a
uniform
what
by
the
way
elapsed
years
since
the
birth
of
some
religious
leader
verkan
vall
explained
and
did
you
find
out
about
my
rifle
oh
yes
it
reproduction
of
something
that
called
a
sharp
model
made
on
an
adjoining
paratime
belt
by
a
company
that
went
out
of
business
years
ago
elapsed
time
on
your
line
of
operation
what
made
the
difference
was
the
second
war
between
the
states
i
do
know
what
that
was
either
i
not
too
well
up
on
fourth
level
history
but
whatever
your
line
of
operation
have
it
probably
just
as
well
for
them
though
they
very
likely
had
something
else
as
bad
or
worse
i
put
in
a
complaint
to
supplies
about
it
and
got
you
some
more
ammunition
and
reloading
tools
now
tell
me
what
you
going
to
do
about
this
nighthound
business
tortha
karf
was
silent
for
a
while
after
verkan
vall
had
finished
you
taking
some
awful
chances
vall
he
said
at
length
the
way
you
plan
doing
it
the
advantages
will
all
be
with
the
nighthound
those
things
can
see
as
well
at
night
as
you
can
in
daylight
i
suppose
you
know
that
though
you
the
nighthound
specialist
now
yes
but
they
accustomed
to
the
venus
hotland
marshes
it
been
dry
weather
for
the
last
two
weeks
all
over
the
northeastern
section
of
the
northern
continent
i
be
able
to
hear
it
long
before
it
gets
close
to
me
and
i
be
wearing
an
electric
headlamp
when
i
snap
that
on
it
be
dazzled
for
a
moment
well
as
i
said
you
the
nighthound
specialist
there
the
communicator
order
anything
you
need
he
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
from
the
end
of
the
old
one
before
crushing
it
out
but
be
careful
vall
it
took
me
close
to
forty
years
to
make
a
paratimer
out
of
you
i
do
want
to
have
to
repeat
the
process
with
somebody
else
before
i
can
retire
the
grass
was
wet
as
verkan
vall
who
reminded
himself
that
here
he
was
called
richard
lee
crossed
the
yard
from
the
farmhouse
to
the
ramshackle
barn
in
the
early
autumn
darkness
it
had
been
raining
that
morning
when
the
from
dhergabar
had
landed
him
at
the
hagraban
synthetics
works
on
the
first
level
unaffected
by
the
probabilities
of
human
history
the
same
rain
had
been
coming
down
on
the
old
kinchwalter
farm
near
rutter
fort
on
the
fourth
level
and
it
had
persisted
all
day
in
a
slow
deliberate
drizzle
he
did
like
that
the
woods
would
be
wet
muffling
his
footsteps
and
canceling
his
only
advantage
over
the
he
hunted
he
had
no
idea
however
of
postponing
the
hunt
if
anything
the
rain
had
made
it
all
the
more
imperative
that
the
nighthound
be
killed
at
once
at
this
season
a
falling
temperature
would
speedily
follow
the
nighthound
a
creature
of
the
hot
venus
marshes
would
suffer
from
the
cold
and
taught
by
years
of
domestication
to
find
warmth
among
human
habitations
it
would
invade
some
isolated
farmhouse
or
worse
one
of
the
little
valley
villages
if
it
were
not
killed
tonight
the
incident
he
had
come
to
prevent
would
certainly
occur
going
to
the
barn
he
spread
an
old
horse
blanket
on
the
seat
of
the
jeep
laid
his
rifle
on
it
and
then
backed
the
jeep
outside
then
he
took
off
his
coat
removing
his
pipe
and
tobacco
from
the
pockets
and
spread
it
on
the
wet
grass
he
unwrapped
a
package
and
took
out
a
small
plastic
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
first
level
aiming
it
at
the
coat
and
pressing
the
trigger
until
it
blew
itself
empty
a
sickening
rancid
fetor
tainted
the
air
the
scent
of
the
giant
of
venus
the
one
creature
for
which
the
nighthound
bore
an
inborn
implacable
hatred
it
was
because
of
this
compulsive
urge
to
attack
and
kill
the
deadly
that
the
first
human
settlers
on
venus
long
millennia
ago
had
domesticated
the
ugly
and
savage
nighthound
he
remembered
that
the
gavran
family
derived
their
title
from
their
vast
venus
hotlands
estates
that
gavran
sarn
the
man
who
had
brought
this
thing
to
the
fourth
level
had
been
born
on
the
inner
planet
when
verkan
vall
donned
that
coat
he
would
become
his
own
living
bait
for
the
murderous
fury
of
the
creature
he
sought
at
the
moment
mastering
his
queasiness
and
putting
on
the
coat
he
objected
less
to
that
danger
than
to
the
hideous
stench
of
the
scent
to
obtain
which
a
valuable
specimen
had
been
sacrificed
at
the
dhergabar
museum
of
extraterrestrial
zoology
the
evening
before
carrying
the
wrapper
and
the
to
an
outside
fireplace
he
snapped
his
lighter
to
them
and
tossed
them
in
they
were
highly
inflammable
blazing
up
and
vanishing
in
a
moment
he
tested
the
electric
headlamp
on
the
front
of
his
cap
checked
his
rifle
drew
the
heavy
revolver
an
authentic
product
of
his
line
of
operation
and
flipped
the
cylinder
out
and
in
again
then
he
got
into
the
jeep
and
drove
away
for
half
an
hour
he
drove
quickly
along
the
valley
roads
now
and
then
he
passed
farmhouses
and
dogs
puzzled
and
angered
by
the
alien
scent
his
coat
bore
barked
furiously
at
length
he
turned
into
a
back
road
and
from
this
to
the
barely
discernible
trace
of
an
old
log
road
the
rain
had
stopped
and
in
order
to
be
ready
to
fire
in
any
direction
at
any
time
he
had
removed
the
top
of
the
jeep
now
he
had
to
crouch
below
the
windshield
to
avoid
overhanging
branches
once
three
deer
a
buck
and
two
does
stopped
in
front
of
him
and
stared
for
a
moment
then
bounded
away
with
a
flutter
of
white
tails
he
was
driving
slowly
now
laying
behind
him
a
reeking
trail
of
scent
there
had
been
another
the
night
before
while
he
had
been
on
the
first
level
the
locality
of
this
latest
depredation
had
confirmed
his
estimate
of
the
beast
probable
movements
and
indicated
where
it
might
be
prowling
tonight
he
was
certain
that
it
was
somewhere
near
sooner
or
later
it
would
pick
up
the
scent
finally
he
stopped
snapping
out
his
lights
he
had
chosen
this
spot
carefully
while
studying
the
geological
survey
map
that
afternoon
he
was
on
the
grade
of
an
old
railroad
line
now
abandoned
and
its
track
long
removed
which
had
served
the
logging
operations
of
fifty
years
ago
on
one
side
the
mountain
slanted
sharply
upward
on
the
other
it
fell
away
sharply
if
the
nighthound
were
below
him
it
would
have
to
climb
that
degree
slope
and
could
not
avoid
dislodging
loose
stones
or
otherwise
making
a
noise
he
would
get
out
on
that
side
if
the
nighthound
were
above
him
the
jeep
would
protect
him
when
it
charged
he
got
to
the
ground
thumbing
off
the
safety
of
his
rifle
and
an
instant
later
he
knew
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
which
could
easily
cost
him
his
life
a
mistake
from
which
neither
his
comprehensive
logic
nor
his
hypnotically
acquired
knowledge
of
the
beast
habits
had
saved
him
as
he
stepped
to
the
ground
facing
toward
the
front
of
the
jeep
he
heard
a
low
whining
cry
behind
him
and
a
rush
of
padded
feet
he
whirled
snapping
on
the
headlamp
with
his
left
hand
and
thrusting
out
his
rifle
in
his
right
for
a
split
second
he
saw
the
charging
animal
its
long
lizardlike
head
split
in
a
toothy
grin
its
extended
he
fired
and
the
bullet
went
wild
the
next
instant
the
rifle
was
knocked
from
his
hand
instinctively
he
flung
up
his
left
arm
to
shield
his
eyes
claws
raked
his
left
arm
and
shoulder
something
struck
him
heavily
along
the
left
side
and
his
went
out
as
he
dropped
and
rolled
under
the
jeep
drawing
in
his
legs
and
fumbling
under
his
coat
for
the
revolver
in
that
instant
he
knew
what
had
gone
wrong
his
plan
had
been
entirely
too
much
of
a
success
the
nighthound
had
winded
him
as
he
had
driven
up
the
old
and
had
followed
its
best
running
speed
had
been
just
good
enough
to
keep
it
a
hundred
or
so
feet
behind
the
jeep
and
the
had
covered
the
padding
of
its
feet
in
the
few
moments
between
stopping
the
little
car
and
getting
out
the
nighthound
had
been
able
to
close
the
distance
and
spring
upon
him
illustration
it
was
characteristic
of
mentality
that
verkan
vall
wasted
no
moments
on
or
panic
while
he
was
still
rolling
under
his
jeep
his
mind
had
been
busy
with
plans
to
retrieve
the
situation
something
touched
the
heel
of
one
boot
and
he
froze
his
leg
into
immobility
at
the
same
time
trying
to
get
the
big
smith
wesson
free
the
he
found
was
badly
torn
though
made
of
the
heaviest
and
the
spring
which
retained
the
weapon
in
place
had
been
wrenched
and
bent
until
he
needed
both
hands
to
draw
the
of
the
nighthound
right
intermediary
limb
had
raked
him
only
the
instinctive
motion
of
throwing
up
his
arm
and
the
fact
that
he
wore
the
revolver
in
a
had
saved
his
life
the
nighthound
was
prowling
around
the
jeep
whining
frantically
it
was
badly
confused
it
could
see
quite
well
even
in
the
close
darkness
of
the
starless
night
its
eyes
were
of
a
nature
capable
of
perceiving
infrared
radiations
as
light
there
were
plenty
of
these
the
engine
lately
running
on
drive
was
quite
hot
had
he
been
standing
alone
especially
on
this
raw
chilly
night
verkan
own
would
have
lighted
him
up
like
a
now
however
the
hot
engine
above
him
masked
his
own
radiations
moreover
the
scent
on
his
coat
was
coming
up
through
the
floor
board
and
mingling
with
the
scent
on
the
seat
yet
the
nighthound
find
the
foot
insectlike
thing
that
should
have
been
producing
it
verkan
vall
lay
motionless
wondering
how
long
the
next
move
would
be
in
coming
then
he
heard
a
thud
above
him
followed
by
a
furious
tearing
as
the
nighthound
ripped
the
blanket
and
began
rending
at
the
seat
cushion
hope
it
gets
a
of
verkan
vall
commented
mentally
he
had
already
found
a
stone
about
the
size
of
his
two
fists
and
another
slightly
smaller
and
had
put
one
in
each
of
the
side
pockets
of
the
coat
now
he
slipped
his
revolver
into
his
and
writhed
out
of
the
coat
shedding
the
ruined
at
the
same
time
wriggling
on
the
flat
of
his
back
he
squirmed
between
the
rear
wheels
until
he
was
able
to
sit
up
behind
the
jeep
then
swinging
the
weighted
coat
he
flung
it
forward
over
the
nighthound
and
the
jeep
itself
at
the
same
time
drawing
his
revolver
immediately
the
nighthound
lured
by
the
sudden
movement
of
the
principal
source
of
the
scent
jumped
out
of
the
jeep
and
bounded
after
the
coat
and
there
was
considerable
noise
in
the
brush
on
the
lower
side
of
the
railroad
grade
at
once
verkan
vall
swarmed
into
the
jeep
and
snapped
on
the
lights
his
stratagem
had
succeeded
beautifully
the
stinking
coat
had
landed
on
the
top
of
a
small
bush
about
ten
feet
in
front
of
the
jeep
and
ten
feet
from
the
ground
the
nighthound
erect
on
its
haunches
was
reaching
out
with
its
front
paws
to
drag
it
down
and
slashing
angrily
at
it
with
its
intermediary
limbs
its
back
was
to
verkan
vall
his
sights
clearly
defined
by
the
lights
in
front
of
him
the
paratimer
centered
them
on
the
base
of
the
creature
spine
just
above
its
secondary
shoulders
and
carefully
squeezed
the
trigger
the
big
magnum
bucked
in
his
hand
and
belched
flame
and
sound
if
only
these
fourth
level
weapons
were
so
confoundedly
boisterous
and
the
nighthound
screamed
and
fell
recocking
the
revolver
verkan
vall
waited
for
an
instant
then
nodded
in
satisfaction
the
beast
spine
had
been
smashed
and
its
hind
quarters
and
even
its
intermediary
fighting
limbs
had
been
paralyzed
he
aimed
carefully
for
a
second
shot
and
fired
into
the
base
of
the
thing
skull
it
quivered
and
died
getting
a
flashlight
he
found
his
rifle
sticking
in
the
mud
a
little
behind
and
to
the
right
of
the
jeep
and
swore
briefly
in
the
local
fourth
level
idiom
for
verkan
vall
was
a
man
who
loved
good
weapons
be
they
needlers
blasters
or
the
projectors
of
the
lower
levels
by
this
time
he
was
feeling
considerable
pain
from
the
he
had
received
he
peeled
off
his
shirt
and
tossed
it
over
the
hood
of
the
jeep
tortha
karf
had
advised
him
to
carry
a
needler
or
a
blaster
or
a
but
verkan
vall
had
been
unwilling
to
take
such
arms
onto
the
fourth
level
in
event
of
mishap
to
himself
it
would
be
all
too
easy
for
such
a
weapon
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
someone
able
to
deduce
from
it
scientific
principles
too
far
in
advance
of
the
general
fourth
level
culture
but
there
had
been
one
first
level
item
which
he
had
permitted
himself
mainly
because
suitably
packaged
it
was
not
readily
identifiable
as
such
digging
a
respectable
leatherette
case
from
under
the
seat
he
opened
it
and
took
out
a
pint
bottle
with
a
red
and
a
towel
saturating
the
towel
with
the
contents
of
the
bottle
he
rubbed
every
inch
of
his
torso
with
it
so
as
not
to
miss
even
the
smallest
break
made
in
his
skin
by
the
septic
claws
of
the
nighthound
whenever
the
towel
touched
raw
skin
a
pain
like
the
burn
of
a
hot
iron
shot
through
him
before
he
was
through
he
was
in
agony
satisfied
that
he
had
disinfected
every
wound
he
dropped
the
towel
and
clung
weakly
to
the
side
of
the
jeep
he
grunted
out
a
string
of
english
oaths
and
capped
them
with
an
obscene
spanish
blasphemy
he
had
picked
up
among
the
fourth
level
inhabitants
of
his
island
home
of
nerros
to
the
south
and
a
thundering
curse
in
the
name
of
mogga
of
dool
in
a
tongue
he
mentioned
fasif
great
god
of
khift
in
a
manner
which
would
have
got
him
an
if
the
khiftan
priests
had
heard
him
he
alluded
to
the
baroque
amatory
practices
of
the
illyalla
people
and
soothed
himself
in
the
classical
tongue
with
one
of
those
rambling
genealogical
insults
favored
in
the
sector
of
the
fourth
level
by
this
time
the
pain
had
subsided
to
an
smarting
itch
have
to
bear
with
that
until
his
work
was
finished
and
he
could
enjoy
a
hot
bath
he
got
another
bottle
out
of
the
kit
a
flat
pint
labeled
old
overholt
containing
a
specific
for
inward
and
subjective
wounds
and
medicated
himself
copiously
from
it
corking
it
and
slipping
it
into
his
hip
pocket
against
future
need
he
gathered
up
the
ruined
and
threw
it
under
the
back
seat
he
put
on
his
shirt
then
he
went
and
dragged
the
dead
nighthound
onto
the
grade
by
its
stumpy
tail
it
was
an
ugly
thing
weighing
close
to
two
hundred
pounds
with
powerfully
muscled
hind
legs
which
furnished
the
bulk
of
its
and
sturdy
front
legs
its
secondary
limbs
about
a
third
of
the
way
back
from
its
front
shoulders
were
long
and
slender
normally
they
were
carried
folded
closely
against
the
body
and
each
was
armed
with
a
single
curving
claw
the
had
gone
in
at
the
base
of
the
skull
and
emerged
under
the
jaw
the
head
was
relatively
undamaged
verkan
vall
was
glad
of
that
he
wanted
that
head
for
the
of
his
home
on
nerros
grunting
and
straining
he
got
the
thing
into
the
back
of
the
jeep
and
flung
his
almost
shredded
tweed
coat
over
it
a
last
look
around
assured
him
that
he
had
left
nothing
unaccountable
or
suspicious
the
brush
was
broken
where
the
nighthound
had
been
tearing
at
the
coat
a
bear
might
have
done
that
there
were
splashes
of
the
viscid
stuff
the
thing
had
used
for
blood
but
they
would
be
there
long
terrestrial
rodents
liked
nighthound
blood
and
the
woods
were
full
of
mice
he
climbed
in
under
the
wheel
backed
turned
and
drove
away
inside
the
dome
verkan
vall
turned
from
the
body
of
the
nighthound
which
he
had
just
dragged
in
and
considered
the
inert
form
of
another
animal
a
tawny
canada
lynx
that
particular
animal
had
already
made
two
paratime
transpositions
captured
in
the
vast
wilderness
of
north
america
it
had
been
taken
to
the
first
level
and
placed
in
the
dhergabar
zoological
gardens
and
then
requisitioned
on
the
authority
of
tortha
karf
it
had
been
brought
to
the
fourth
level
by
verkan
vall
it
was
almost
at
the
end
of
all
its
travels
verkan
vall
prodded
the
supine
animal
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
it
twitched
slightly
its
feet
were
with
straps
but
when
he
saw
that
the
narcotic
was
wearing
off
verkan
vall
snatched
a
syringe
parted
the
fur
at
the
base
of
its
neck
and
gave
it
an
injection
after
a
moment
he
picked
it
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
it
out
to
the
jeep
all
right
pussy
cat
he
said
placing
it
under
the
rear
seat
this
is
the
ride
the
way
you
doped
up
it
wo
hurt
a
bit
he
went
back
and
rummaged
in
the
debris
of
the
barn
he
picked
up
a
hoe
and
discarded
it
as
too
light
an
old
plowshare
was
too
unhandy
he
considered
a
from
a
heating
furnace
and
then
he
found
the
poleax
lying
among
a
pile
of
wormeaten
boards
its
handle
had
been
shortened
at
some
time
to
about
twelve
inches
converting
it
into
a
heavy
hatchet
he
weighed
it
and
tried
it
on
a
block
of
wood
and
then
making
sure
that
the
secret
door
was
closed
he
went
out
again
and
drove
off
an
hour
later
he
returned
opening
the
secret
door
he
carried
the
ruined
shoulder
holster
and
the
straps
that
had
bound
the
feet
and
the
ax
now
splotched
with
blood
and
tawny
into
the
dome
then
he
closed
the
secret
room
and
took
a
long
drink
from
the
bottle
on
his
hip
the
job
was
done
he
would
take
a
hot
bath
and
sleep
in
the
farmhouse
till
noon
and
then
he
would
return
to
the
first
level
maybe
tortha
karf
would
want
him
to
come
back
here
for
a
while
the
situation
on
this
was
far
from
satisfactory
even
if
the
crisis
threatened
by
gavran
sarn
renegade
pet
had
been
averted
the
presence
of
a
assistant
might
be
desirable
at
least
he
had
a
right
to
expect
a
short
vacation
he
thought
of
the
little
redhead
at
the
hagraban
synthetics
works
what
was
her
name
something
kara
morvan
kara
that
was
it
she
be
coming
off
shift
about
the
time
he
make
first
level
tomorrow
afternoon
the
were
still
smarting
vexatiously
a
hot
bath
and
a
night
sleep
he
took
another
drink
lit
his
pipe
picked
up
his
rifle
and
started
across
the
yard
to
the
house
private
zinkowski
cradled
the
telephone
and
got
up
from
the
desk
stretching
he
left
the
and
walked
across
the
hall
to
the
recreation
room
where
the
rest
of
the
boys
were
loafing
sergeant
haines
in
a
languid
game
with
corporal
conner
a
sheriff
deputy
and
a
mechanic
from
the
service
station
down
the
road
looked
up
well
sarge
i
think
we
can
write
off
those
the
private
said
yeah
the
sergeant
interest
quickened
yeah
i
think
the
whatzit
had
it
i
just
got
a
buzz
from
the
railroad

a
dead
bobcat
on
the
logan
river
branch
about
a
mile
or
so
below
mmy
signal
tower
looks
like
it
tangled
with
that
night
freight
and
came
off
second
best
it
was
near
chopped
to
hamburger
mmy
signal
tower
that
right
below
yoder
crossing
the
sergeant
considered
the
strawmyer
farm
the
amrine
farm
last
night
yeah
that
would
be
about
right
that
suit
steve
parker
bobcats
are
protected
so
it
not
his
trouble

he
got
up
and
started
for
the
phone
phantom
killer
he
blew
an
impolite
noise
well
it
was
a
lot
of
excitement
while
it
lasted
the
deputy
sheriff
said
just
like
that
flying
saucer
thing
the
end
