acknowledgments
this
acknowledgment
is
necessary
if
i
am
to
say
thanks
to
some
experts
to
whom
i
am
indebted
there
is
captain
charles
benjamin
who
read
over
the
aviation
parts
of
this
book
with
pursed
lips
and
a
belligerent
attitude
toward
questionable
statements
of
fact
or
observation
there
is
john
drury
clark
whose
authoritative
knowledge
of
rocket
fuels
was
the
basis
for
admitted
but
not
extravagant
extrapolation
on
my
part
there
is
the
crew
of
a
transport
ship
who
argued
over
my
manuscript
and
settled
the
argument
by
a
zestful
drill
repeat
drill
expressly
to
make
sure
i
had
described
all
the
procedure
just
right
there
is
willy
ley
whom
i
would
like
to
exempt
from
responsibility
for
any
statement
in
the
book
while
i
acknowledge
the
value
of
personal
talks
with
him
and
the
pleasure
anybody
who
has
ever
read
his
books
will
recognize
and
there
is
hugh
rice
of
the
hayden
planetarium
who
will
probably
be
surprised
to
find
that
i
feel
i
owe
him
gratitude
they
are
in
great
part
responsible
for
the
factual
matter
in
this
book
i
think
i
may
add
though
that
i
worked
on
it
too
murray
leinster
ardudwy
gloucester
there
was
anything
underneath
but
clouds
and
there
was
anything
overhead
but
sky
joe
kenmore
looked
out
the
plane
window
past
the
shoulder
he
stared
ahead
to
where
the
sky
and
cloud
bank
joined
it
was
many
miles
away
and
tried
to
picture
the
job
before
him
back
in
the
cargo
space
of
the
plane
there
were
four
big
crates
they
contained
the
pilot
gyros
for
the
most
important
object
then
being
built
on
earth
and
it
would
work
properly
without
them
it
was
joe
job
to
take
that
highly
specialized
magnificently
precise
machinery
to
its
destination
help
to
install
it
and
see
to
its
checking
after
it
was
installed
he
felt
uneasy
of
course
the
pilot
and
the
only
two
other
people
on
the
transport
plane
knew
their
stuff
every
imaginable
precaution
would
be
taken
to
make
sure
that
a
critically
essential
device
like
the
pilot
gyro
assembly
would
get
safely
where
it
belonged
it
would
be
it
was
being
treated
as
if
it
were
a
crate
of
eggs
instead
of
massive
metal
smoothed
and
polished
and
lapped
to
a
precision
practically
unheard
of
but
just
the
same
joe
was
worried
he
seen
the
pilot
gyro
assembly
made
he
helped
on
it
he
knew
how
many
times
a
thousandth
of
an
inch
had
been
split
in
machining
its
bearings
and
the
balance
of
its
moving
parts
he
have
liked
to
be
back
in
the
cargo
compartment
with
it
but
only
the
pilot
cabin
was
pressurized
and
the
ship
was
at
eighteen
thousand
feet
flying
west
by
south
he
tried
to
get
his
mind
off
that
impulse
by
remembering
that
at
eighteen
thousand
feet
a
good
half
of
the
air
on
earth
was
underneath
him
and
by
hoping
that
the
other
half
would
be
as
easy
to
rise
above
when
the
gyros
were
finally
in
place
and
starting
out
for
space
the
gyros
of
course
were
now
on
their
way
to
be
installed
in
the
artificial
satellite
to
be
blasted
up
and
set
in
an
orbit
around
the
earth
as
the
initial
stage
of
that
figurative
stepladder
by
which
men
would
make
their
first
attempt
to
reach
the
stars
until
that
space
platform
left
the
ground
the
gyros
were
joe
responsibility
the
plane
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stretched
luxuriously
he
loosened
his
safety
belt
and
got
up
he
stepped
carefully
past
the
column
between
the
and
pilot
seats
that
column
contained
a
fraction
of
the
innumerable
dials
and
controls
the
pilots
of
a
modern
plane
have
to
watch
and
handle
the
went
to
the
coffeepot
and
flipped
a
switch
joe
fidgeted
again
on
his
improvised
seat
again
he
wished
that
he
could
be
riding
in
back
with
the
crates
but
it
would
be
silly
to
insist
on
perching
somewhere
in
the
freight
compartment
there
was
a
steady
roaring
in
the
cabin
the
motors
one
ears
got
accustomed
to
it
and
by
now
the
noise
sounded
as
if
it
were
heard
through
cushions
presently
the
coffeepot
bubbled
unheard
the
lighted
a
cigarette
then
he
drew
a
paper
cup
of
coffee
and
handed
it
to
the
pilot
the
pilot
seemed
negligently
to
contemplate
some
dozens
of
dials
all
of
which
were
duly
duplicated
on
the
side
the
glanced
at
joe
coffee
thanks
said
joe
he
took
the
paper
cup
the
said
everything
okay
with
you
i
all
right
said
joe
he
realized
that
the
felt
talkative
he
explained
those
crates
i
traveling
with
the
family
been
working
on
that
machinery
for
months
it
was
finished
with
the
final
grinding
done
practically
with
feather
dusters
i
ca
help
worrying
about
it
there
was
four
months
work
in
just
lapping
the
shafts
and
balancing
rotors
we
made
a
telescope
mounting
once
for
an
observatory
in
south
africa
but
compared
to
this
gadget
we
worked
on
that
one
blindfolded
pilot
gyros
eh
said
the
that
what
the
waybill
said
but
if
they
were
all
right
when
they
left
the
plant
they
be
all
right
when
they
are
delivered
joe
said
ruefully
still
i
feel
better
riding
back
there
with
them
sabotage
bad
at
the
plant
asked
the
tough
sabotage
no
why
should
there
be
sabotage
demanded
joe
the
said
mildly
not
quite
everybody
is
anxious
to
see
the
space
platform
take
off
not
everybody
what
on
earth
do
you
think
is
the
biggest
problem
out
where
they
building
it
i
would
know
admitted
joe
keeping
the
weight
down
but
there
is
a
new
rocket
fuel
that
supposed
to
be
all
right
for
sending
the
platform
up
was
that
the
worst
problem
getting
a
rocket
fuel
with
enough
power
per
pound
the
sipped
his
coffee
and
made
a
face
it
was
too
hot
fella
he
said
drily
that
stuff
was
easy
the
boys
did
that
the
big
job
in
making
a
new
moon
for
the
earth
is
keeping
it
from
being
blown
up
before
it
can
get
out
to
space
there
are
a
few
gentlemen
who
thrive
on
power
politics
they
know
that
once
the
floating
serenely
around
the
earth
with
a
nice
stock
of
guided
missiles
on
board
power
politics
is
finished
so
they
doing
what
they
can
to
keep
the
world
as
it
always
been
equipped
with
just
one
moon
and
many
armies
and
they
doing
plenty
if
you
ask
me
i
heard
began
joe
you
have
heard
the
half
of
it
said
the
the
air
transport
has
lost
nearly
as
many
planes
and
more
men
on
this
particular
airlift
than
it
did
in
korea
while
that
was
the
big
job
i
do
know
how
many
other
men
have
been
killed
but
there
a
strictly
local
hot
war
going
on
out
where
we
headed
no
holds
barred
had
you
heard
it
sounded
exaggerated
joe
said
politely
i
heard
there
was
stuff
going
on
the
pilot
drained
his
cup
and
handed
it
to
the
he
said
he
thinks
you
kidding
him
he
turned
back
to
the
contemplation
of
the
instruments
before
him
and
the
view
out
the
transparent
plastic
of
the
cabin
windows
he
does
the
said
to
joe
you
got
security
checks
around
your
plant
they
were
put
there
for
fun
it
a
hundred
times
worse
where
the
whole
platform
being
built
security
said
joe
he
shrugged
we
know
everybody
who
works
at
the
plant
we
known
them
all
their
lives
they
get
mad
if
we
started
to
get
stuffy
we
do
bother
that
i
like
to
see
said
the
skeptically
no
barbed
wire
around
the
plant
no
identity
badges
you
wear
when
you
go
in
no
security
officer
screaming
blue
murder
every
five
minutes
what
do
you
think
all
that
for
you
built
these
pilot
gyros
you
had
to
have
that
security
stuff
but
we
did
insisted
joe
not
any
of
it
the
plant
been
in
the
same
village
for
eighty
years
it
started
building
wagons
and
plows
and
now
it
turns
out
machine
tools
and
precision
machinery
it
the
only
factory
around
and
everybody
who
works
there
went
to
school
with
everybody
else
and
so
did
our
fathers
and
we
know
one
another
the
was
unconvinced
no
kidding
no
kidding
joe
assured
him
in
world
war
two
the
only
spy
scare
in
the
village
was
an
fbi
man
who
came
around
looking
for
spies
the
village
cop
locked
him
up
and
would
believe
in
his
credentials
they
had
to
send
somebody
from
washington
to
get
him
out
of
jail
the
grinned
reluctantly
i
guess
there
are
such
places
he
said
enviously
you
should
built
the
platform
it
plenty
different
on
this
job
we
ca
even
talk
to
a
girl
without
security
clearance
for
an
interview
beforehand
and
we
ca
speak
to
strange
men
or
go
out
alone
after
dark
the
pilot
grunted
the
tone
changed
not
quite
that
bad
he
admitted
but
it
bad
it
really
bad
we
lost
three
planes
last
week
i
guess
you
call
it
in
action
against
saboteurs
one
flew
to
pieces
in
sabotage
carrying
critical
stuff
one
crashed
on
carrying
irreplaceable
instruments
somebody
put
a
detonator
in
a
and
one
froze
in
its
landing
glide
and
flew
into
its
landing
field
they
had
to
scrape
it
up
when
this
ship
got
a
major
overhaul
two
weeks
ago
we
flew
it
with
our
fingers
crossed
for
four
trips
running
seems
to
be
all
right
though
we
gave
it
the
works
but
i
wo
look
forward
to
a
serene
old
age
until
the
platform
out
of
atmosphere
not
me
he
went
to
put
the
pilot
empty
cup
in
the
disposal
slot
the
plane
went
on
there
was
anything
underneath
but
clouds
and
there
was
anything
overhead
but
sky
the
clouds
were
a
long
way
down
and
the
sky
was
simply
up
joe
looked
down
and
saw
a
faint
spot
of
racing
brightness
with
a
hint
of
colors
around
it
it
was
the
sort
of
nimbus
that
substitutes
for
a
shadow
when
a
plane
is
high
enough
above
the
clouds
it
raced
madly
over
the
irregular
upper
surface
of
the
cloud
layer
the
plane
flew
and
flew
nothing
happened
at
all
this
was
two
hours
from
the
field
from
which
it
had
taken
off
with
the
pilot
gyro
cases
as
its
last
item
of
collected
cargo
joe
remembered
how
grimly
the
two
crew
members
had
prevented
anybody
from
even
approaching
it
on
the
ground
except
those
who
actually
loaded
the
cases
and
how
one
of
the
two
had
watched
them
every
second
joe
fidgeted
he
did
quite
know
how
to
take
the
talk
the
kenmore
precision
tool
plant
was
owned
by
his
family
but
it
was
so
much
a
family
as
a
civic
enterprise
the
young
men
of
the
village
grew
up
to
regard
fanatically
fine
workmanship
with
the
casual
elsewhere
reserved
for
plowing
or
fishing
joe
father
owned
it
and
some
day
joe
might
head
it
but
he
hope
to
keep
the
respect
of
the
men
in
the
plant
unless
he
could
handle
every
tool
on
the
place
and
split
a
thousandth
at
least
five
ways
ten
would
be
better
but
as
long
as
the
feeling
at
the
plant
stayed
as
it
was
now
there
never
be
a
security
problem
there
if
the
was
telling
the
truth
though
joe
found
a
slow
burn
beginning
inside
him
he
had
a
picture
in
his
mind
that
was
practically
a
dream
it
was
of
something
big
and
bright
and
ungainly
swimming
silently
in
emptiness
with
a
field
of
stars
behind
it
the
stars
were
tiny
pin
points
of
light
they
were
unwinking
and
distinct
because
there
was
no
air
where
this
thing
floated
the
blackness
between
them
was
absolute
because
this
was
space
itself
the
thing
that
floated
was
a
moon
a
moon
it
was
an
artificial
satellite
of
earth
men
were
now
building
it
presently
it
would
float
as
joe
dreamed
of
it
and
where
the
sun
struck
it
it
would
be
unbearably
bright
and
where
there
were
shadows
they
would
be
abysmally
black
except
perhaps
when
earthshine
from
the
planet
below
would
outline
it
in
a
ghostly
fashion
there
would
be
men
in
the
thing
that
floated
in
space
it
swam
in
a
splendid
orbit
about
the
world
that
had
built
it
sometimes
there
were
small
ships
that
so
joe
imagined
would
fight
their
way
up
to
it
panting
great
plumes
of
rocket
smoke
and
bringing
food
and
fuel
to
its
crew
and
presently
one
of
those
panting
small
ships
would
refill
its
fuel
tanks
to
the
bursting
point
from
the
fuel
other
ships
had
brought
and
yet
the
ship
would
have
no
weight
so
it
would
drift
away
from
the
greater
floating
thing
in
space
and
suddenly
its
rockets
would
spout
flame
and
fumes
and
it
would
head
triumphantly
out
and
away
from
earth
and
it
would
be
the
first
vessel
ever
to
strike
out
for
the
stars
that
was
the
picture
joe
had
of
the
space
platform
and
its
meaning
maybe
it
was
romantic
but
men
were
working
right
now
to
make
that
romance
come
true
this
transport
plane
was
flying
to
a
small
town
improbably
called
bootstrap
carrying
one
of
the
most
essential
devices
for
the
platform
equipment
in
the
desert
near
bootstrap
there
was
a
gigantic
construction
shed
inside
that
shed
men
were
building
exactly
the
monstrous
object
that
joe
pictured
to
himself
they
were
trying
to
realize
a
dream
men
have
dreamed
for
decades
the
necessary
space
platform
that
would
be
the
dock
the
wharf
the
starting
point
from
which
the
first
of
human
space
explorers
could
start
for
infinity
the
idea
that
anybody
could
want
to
halt
such
an
undertaking
made
joe
kenmore
burn
the
painstakingly
crushed
out
his
cigarette
the
ship
flew
with
more
steadiness
than
a
railroad
car
rolls
on
rails
there
was
the
oddly
cushioned
sound
of
the
motors
it
was
all
very
but
joe
said
angrily
look
is
any
of
what
you
said
well
kidding
i
wish
it
were
fella
said
the
i
can
talk
to
you
about
it
but
most
of
it
hushed
up
i
tell
you
why
can
you
talk
to
me
demanded
joe
suspiciously
what
makes
it
all
right
for
you
to
talk
to
me
you
got
passage
on
this
ship
that
means
something
does
it
asked
joe
the
pilot
turned
in
his
seat
to
glance
at
joe
do
you
think
we
carry
passengers
regularly
he
asked
mildly
why
not
pilot
and
looked
at
each
other
tell
him
said
the
pilot
about
five
months
ago
said
the
there
was
an
army
colonel
wangled
a
ride
to
bootstrap
on
a
cargo
plane
the
plane
took
off
it
flew
all
right
until
twenty
miles
from
bootstrap
then
it
stopped
checking
it
dove
straight
for
the
shed
the
platform
being
built
in
it
was
shot
down
when
it
hit
there
was
an
explosion
the
shrugged
you
wo
believe
me
maybe
but
a
week
later
they
found
the
colonel
body
back
east
somebody
murdered
him
joe
blinked
it
was
the
colonel
who
rode
as
a
passenger
said
the
it
was
somebody
else
twenty
miles
from
bootstrap
he
shot
the
pilots
and
taken
the
controls
that
what
they
figure
anyhow
he
meant
to
dive
into
the
construction
shed
because
very
very
cleverly
they
managed
to
get
a
bomb
in
the
plane
disguised
as
cargo
they
got
the
men
done
that
later
but
it
was
rather
late
joe
said
dubiously
but
would
one
bomb
destroy
the
shed
and
the
platform
this
one
would
said
the
it
was
an
atom
bomb
but
it
a
good
one
it
did
detonate
properly
it
was
a
joe
saw
the
implications
cranks
and
crackpots
could
get
hold
of
the
materials
for
atom
bombs
it
took
the
resources
of
a
large
nation
for
that
but
a
nation
that
did
quite
dare
start
an
open
war
might
try
to
sneak
in
one
atom
bomb
to
destroy
the
space
station
once
the
platform
was
launched
no
other
nation
could
dream
of
world
domination
the
united
states
would
go
to
war
if
the
platform
was
destroyed
but
there
could
be
a
strictly
local
hot
war
the
pilot
said
sharply
something
down
below
the
fairly
leaped
into
his
seat
his
safety
belt
buckled
in
half
a
heartbeat
check
he
said
in
a
new
tone
where
the
pilot
pointed
i
saw
something
dark
he
said
briefly
where
there
was
a
deep
dent
in
the
cloud
the
threw
a
switch
within
seconds
a
new
sound
entered
the
cabin
they
were
thin
squeaks
spaced
a
full
apart
that
rose
to
inaudibility
in
pitch
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
they
lasted
the
snatched
a
hand
phone
from
the
wall
above
his
head
and
held
it
to
his
lips
flight
calling
he
said
crisply
something
got
a
radar
on
us
we
saw
it
get
a
fix
on
us
and
come
we
at
eighteen
thousand
and
here
the
floor
of
the
cabin
tilted
markedly
now
climbing
get
a
fix
on
us
and
come
over
he
took
the
phone
from
his
lips
and
said
conversationally
radar
a
giveaway
this
is
no
you
would
think
he
take
that
much
of
a
chance
would
you
joe
clenched
his
hands
the
pilot
did
things
to
the
levers
on
the
column
between
the
two
pilots
seats
he
said
curtly
arm
the
jatos
the
did
something
mysterious
and
said
check
all
this
took
place
in
seconds
the
pilot
said
i
see
something
and
instantly
there
was
swift
tense
teamwork
in
action
a
call
by
radio
asking
for
help
the
plane
headed
up
for
greater
clearance
between
it
and
the
clouds
the
jatos
made
ready
for
firing
they
were
the
rockets
which
on
a
short
or
rough
field
would
double
the
motors
thrust
for
a
matter
of
seconds
in
straightaway
flight
they
should
make
the
plane
leap
ahead
like
a
scared
rabbit
but
they
would
last
long
i
do
like
this
said
the
in
a
flat
voice
i
do
see
what
he
could
do
then
he
stopped
something
zoomed
out
of
a
cloud
the
action
was
completely
improbable
the
thing
that
appeared
looked
absolutely
commonplace
it
was
a
private
plane
the
sort
that
cruises
at
one
hundred
and
knots
and
can
hit
nearly
if
pushed
it
was
expensive
but
not
large
it
came
straight
up
out
of
the
cloud
layer
and
went
lazily
over
on
its
back
and
dived
down
into
the
cloud
layer
again
it
looked
like
somebody
stunting
for
his
own
private
lunatic
pleasure
the
kind
of
crazy
thing
some
people
do
and
for
which
there
is
no
possible
explanation
but
there
was
an
explanation
for
this
at
the
very
top
of
the
loop
threads
of
white
smoke
appeared
they
should
have
been
unnoticeable
against
the
cloud
but
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
they
were
silhouetted
against
the
silver
wings
and
they
were
not
misty
wisps
of
vapor
they
were
dense
sharply
defined
rocket
trails
they
shot
upward
spreading
out
they
unreeled
with
incredible
velocity
the
pilot
hit
something
with
the
heel
of
his
hand
there
was
a
delay
then
the
transport
leaped
forward
with
a
force
to
stop
one
breath
the
jatos
were
firing
furiously
and
the
ship
jumped
there
was
a
bellowing
that
drowned
out
the
sound
of
the
engines
joe
was
slammed
back
on
the
rear
wall
of
the
cabin
he
struggled
against
the
force
that
pushed
him
tailward
he
heard
the
pilot
saying
calmly
that
plane
shot
rockets
at
us
if
they
guided
we
sunk
then
the
threads
of
smoke
became
the
thickness
of
cables
of
columns
they
should
have
ringed
the
transport
plane
in
but
the
jatos
had
jumped
it
crazily
forward
and
were
still
thrusting
fiercely
to
make
it
go
faster
than
any
could
the
acceleration
made
the
muscles
at
the
front
of
joe
throat
ache
as
he
held
his
head
upright
against
it
they
be
proximity
then
the
plane
bucked
very
probably
at
that
moment
it
was
stretched
far
past
the
limit
of
strain
for
which
even
its
factor
of
safety
was
designed
one
rocket
had
let
go
the
others
went
with
it
the
rockets
had
had
proximity
fuses
if
they
had
ringed
the
transport
ship
and
gone
off
with
it
enclosed
it
would
now
be
a
tumbling
mass
of
wreckage
but
the
jatos
had
thrown
the
plane
out
ahead
of
the
target
area
suddenly
they
cut
off
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
ship
had
braked
but
the
pilot
dived
steeply
for
speed
the
was
saying
coldly
into
the
microphone
he
shot
rockets
looked
like
army
issue
three
point
fives
with
proximities
they
missed
and
we
mighty
lonely
the
transport
tore
on
both
pilots
grimly
watching
the
cloud
bank
below
they
moved
their
bodies
as
they
stared
out
the
windows
so
that
by
no
possibility
could
any
part
of
the
plane
mask
something
that
they
should
see
as
they
searched
the
spoke
evenly
into
the
microphone
at
his
lips
he
would
carry
more
than
four
rockets
and
he
dumping
his
racks
and
firing
equipment
now
but
he
might
have
a
friend
with
him
better
get
here
quick
if
you
want
to
catch
him
he
be
the
innocentest
private
pilot
you
ever
saw
in
no
time
then
the
pilot
grunted
something
was
streaking
across
the
cloud
formation
far
far
ahead
three
things
they
were
jet
planes
and
they
seemed
not
so
much
to
approach
as
to
swell
in
size
they
were
coming
at
better
than
five
hundred
knots
ten
miles
a
minute
and
the
transport
was
heading
for
them
at
its
top
speed
of
three
hundred
knots
the
transport
and
the
flight
of
jets
neared
each
other
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
in
less
than
four
seconds
the
said
crisply
silver
messner
with
red
the
number
began
he
gave
the
letter
and
first
digits
of
the
vanished
plane
official
designation
without
which
it
could
not
take
off
from
or
be
serviced
at
any
flying
field
joe
heard
an
insistent
swift
which
would
be
the
radars
of
the
approaching
jets
he
could
not
hear
any
answers
that
might
reach
the
as
he
talked
to
unseen
persons
who
would
relay
his
words
to
the
jet
fighters
one
of
them
peeled
off
and
sank
into
the
cloud
layer
the
others
came
on
they
set
up
in
great
circles
about
the
transport
crossing
before
it
above
it
around
it
which
gave
the
effect
of
flying
around
an
object
not
in
motion
at
all
the
pilot
flew
on
frowning
the
said
yes
sure
listening
there
was
a
pause
then
he
said
check
thanks
he
hung
the
instrument
back
where
it
belonged
above
his
head
and
behind
him
he
thoughtfully
mopped
his
brow
he
looked
at
joe
maybe
he
said
mildly
you
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
there
a
sort
of
hot
war
on
to
keep
the
platform
from
taking
off
the
pilot
grunted
here
the
third
jet
coming
up
it
was
true
the
jet
that
had
dived
into
the
clouds
came
up
out
of
the
cloud
formation
with
somehow
an
air
of
impassive
satisfaction
did
they
spot
the
guy
yeah
said
the
he
must
picked
up
my
report
he
dump
his
radar
he
stayed
in
the
cloud
bank
when
the
jet
came
for
him
spotting
him
with
its
stuff
he
tried
to
ram
tried
for
a
collision
so
the
jet
gave
him
the
works
blew
him
apart
make
him
land
maybe
they
pick
up
something
from
the
wreckage
joe
wet
his
lips
i
saw
what
happened
he
said
he
tried
to
smash
us
with
rockets
where
he
get
them
how
were
they
smuggled
in
the
shrugged
maybe
smuggled
in
maybe
stolen
they
coulda
been
landed
from
a
sub
anywhere
on
a
good
many
thousand
miles
of
coast
they
coulda
been
hauled
anywhere
in
a
station
wagon
the
plane
was
a
ship
plenty
of
them
flying
around
it
could
been
bought
easily
enough
all
they
need
would
be
a
farm
somewhere
where
it
could
land
and
they
could
strap
on
a
rocket
rack
and
put
in
a
radar
and
they
need
information
probably
be
a
good
lead
this
business
only
just
so
many
people
could
know
what
was
coming
on
this
ship
and
what
course
it
was
flying
and
so
on
security
will
have
to
check
back
from
that
angle
a
shadow
fell
upon
the
transport
ship
a
jet
shot
past
from
above
it
it
waggled
its
wings
and
changed
course
we
got
to
land
and
be
checked
for
damage
said
the
negligently
these
guys
will
circle
us
and
lead
the
way
as
if
we
needed
it
joe
subsided
he
still
had
in
his
mind
the
glamorous
and
infinitely
alluring
picture
of
the
space
platform
floating
grandly
in
its
orbit
with
sunshine
on
it
and
a
multitude
of
stars
beyond
he
had
been
completely
absorbed
in
that
aspect
of
the
job
that
dealt
with
the
method
of
construction
and
the
technical
details
by
which
the
platform
could
be
made
to
work
now
he
had
a
side
light
on
the
sort
of
thing
that
has
to
be
done
when
anything
important
is
achieved
figuring
out
how
a
thing
can
be
done
is
only
part
of
the
job
overcoming
the
obstacles
to
the
apparently
commonplace
steps
is
of
the
difficulty
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
the
most
dramatic
aspect
of
building
the
space
platform
had
been
the
achievement
of
a
design
that
would
work
in
space
that
could
be
gotten
up
into
space
and
that
could
be
lived
in
under
circumstances
never
before
experienced
now
he
saw
that
getting
the
materials
to
the
spot
where
they
were
needed
called
for
nearly
as
much
brains
and
effort
screening
out
spies
and
destructionists
that
would
be
an
even
greater
achievement
he
began
to
feel
a
tremendous
respect
and
solicitude
for
the
people
who
were
doing
ordinary
jobs
in
the
building
of
the
platform
and
he
worried
about
his
own
share
more
than
ever
presently
the
transport
ship
sank
toward
the
clouds
it
sped
through
them
from
the
mist
and
then
there
was
a
small
airfield
below
and
the
pilot
and
began
a
pattern
of
ritualistic
conversation
pitot
and
wing
heaters
asked
the
pilot
the
put
his
hand
successively
on
two
controls
off
spark
advance
the
moved
his
hands
and
climb
said
the
blowers
low
fuel
selectors
the
moved
his
hands
again
to
the
appropriate
controls
verifying
that
they
were
as
he
reported
them
main
on
he
said
crossfeed
off
the
transport
plane
slanted
down
steeply
for
the
landing
field
that
had
looked
so
small
at
first
but
expanded
remarkably
as
they
drew
near
joe
found
himself
frowning
he
began
to
see
how
really
big
a
job
it
was
to
get
a
space
platform
even
ready
to
take
off
for
a
journey
that
in
theory
should
last
forever
it
was
daunting
to
think
that
before
a
space
ship
could
be
built
and
powered
and
equipped
with
machinery
there
had
to
be
such
wildly
irrelevant
plans
worked
out
as
a
proper
check
of
controls
for
the
ships
that
flew
parts
to
the
job
the
details
were
innumerable
but
the
job
was
still
worth
doing
joe
was
glad
he
was
going
to
have
a
share
in
it
it
was
a
merely
misty
day
the
transport
plane
stood
by
the
door
of
a
hangar
on
this
military
field
and
mechanics
stood
well
back
from
it
and
looked
it
over
a
man
crawled
over
the
tail
assembly
and
found
one
small
hole
in
the
fabric
of
the
stabilizer
a
shell
fragment
had
gone
through
when
the
war
rockets
exploded
nearby
the
pilot
verified
that
the
fragment
had
hit
no
strengthening
member
inside
he
nodded
the
mechanic
made
very
neat
fabric
patches
over
the
two
holes
upper
and
lower
he
began
to
go
over
the
fuselage
the
pilot
turned
away
i
go
talk
to
bootstrap
he
told
the
you
keep
an
eye
on
things
i
keep
two
eyes
on
them
said
the
the
pilot
went
toward
the
control
tower
of
the
field
joe
looked
around
the
transport
ship
seemed
very
large
standing
on
the
concrete
apron
with
its
tricycle
landing
gear
let
down
it
curiously
resembled
a
misshapen
insect
standing
elaborately
high
on
inadequate
supporting
legs
its
fuselage
in
particular
did
not
look
right
for
an
aircraft
the
top
of
the
cargo
section
went
smoothly
back
to
the
stabilizing
fins
but
the
bottom
did
not
taper
it
ended
astern
in
a
bulge
that
was
closed
by
a
pair
of
huge
clamshell
doors
opening
straight
astern
it
was
built
that
way
of
course
so
that
large
objects
could
be
loaded
direct
into
the
cargo
hold
but
it
was
neither
streamlined
nor
graceful
did
anything
get
into
the
cargo
hold
asked
joe
in
sudden
anxiety
did
the
cases
i
with
get
hit
after
all
four
rockets
had
exploded
deplorably
near
the
ship
if
one
fragment
had
struck
others
might
have
nothing
big
anyhow
the
told
him
we
know
presently
but
examination
showed
no
other
sign
of
the
ship
recent
nearness
to
destruction
it
had
been
overstressed
certainly
but
ships
are
built
to
take
beatings
a
spot
check
on
areas
where
excessive
flexing
of
the
wings
would
have
shown
up
a
big
ship
wings
are
not
perfectly
rigid
they
come
to
pieces
in
the
air
if
they
were
presented
no
evidence
of
damage
the
ship
was
ready
to
take
off
again
the
watched
grimly
until
the
one
mechanic
went
back
to
the
side
lines
the
mechanic
was
not
cordial
he
and
all
the
others
regarded
the
ship
and
joe
and
the
with
disfavor
they
worked
on
jets
and
to
suggest
that
men
who
worked
on
fighter
jets
were
not
worthy
of
complete
confidence
did
not
set
well
with
them
the
noticed
it
they
think
i
a
suspicious
heel
he
said
sourly
to
joe
but
i
have
to
be
the
best
spies
and
saboteurs
in
the
world
have
been
hired
to
mess
up
the
platform
when
better
saboteurs
are
made
they
be
sent
over
here
to
get
busy
the
pilot
came
back
from
the
control
tower
special
flight
orders
he
told
his
companion
we
top
off
with
fuel
and
get
going
mechanics
got
out
the
fuel
hose
dragging
it
from
the
pit
one
man
climbed
up
on
the
wing
other
men
handed
up
the
hose
joe
was
moved
to
comment
but
the
was
reading
the
new
flight
instructions
it
was
one
of
those
moments
of
inconsistency
to
which
anybody
and
everybody
is
liable
the
two
men
of
the
ship
crew
had
it
in
mind
to
be
infinitely
suspicious
of
anybody
examining
their
ship
but
fueling
it
was
so
completely
standard
an
operation
that
they
merely
stood
by
absently
while
it
went
on
they
had
the
orders
to
read
and
memorize
anyhow
one
wing
tank
was
full
a
big
grinning
man
with
sandy
hair
dragged
the
hose
under
the
nose
of
the
plane
to
take
it
to
the
other
wing
tank
close
by
the
nose
wheel
he
slipped
and
steadied
himself
by
the
shaft
which
reaches
down
to
the
wheel
hub
his
position
for
a
moment
was
absurdly
ungraceful
when
he
straightened
up
his
arm
slid
into
the
wheel
well
but
he
dragged
the
hose
the
rest
of
the
way
and
passed
it
on
up
then
that
tank
was
full
and
capped
the
refueling
crew
got
down
to
the
ground
and
fed
the
hose
back
to
the
pit
which
devoured
it
that
was
all
but
somehow
joe
remembered
the
man
and
his
arm
going
up
inside
the
wheel
well
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
the
pilot
read
one
part
of
the
flight
orders
again
and
tore
them
carefully
across
one
part
he
touched
his
pocket
lighter
to
it
burned
he
nodded
yet
again
to
the
and
they
swung
up
and
in
the
pilots
doorway
joe
followed
they
settled
in
their
places
in
the
cabin
the
pilot
threw
a
switch
and
pressed
a
knob
one
motor
turned
over
stiffly
and
caught
the
second
third
fourth
the
pilot
listened
was
satisfied
and
pulled
back
on
the
multiple
throttle
the
plane
trundled
away
minutes
later
it
faced
the
long
runway
a
tinny
voice
from
the
control
tower
spoke
out
of
a
under
the
instruments
and
the
plane
roared
down
the
field
in
seconds
it
lifted
and
swept
around
in
a
great
okay
said
the
pilot
wheels
up
the
obeyed
the
telltale
lights
that
showed
the
wheels
retracted
glowed
briefly
the
men
relaxed
you
know
said
the
there
was
the
devil
of
a
time
during
the
war
with
sabotage
down
in
brazil
there
was
a
field
planes
used
to
take
off
from
to
fly
to
africa
but
they
take
off
head
out
to
sea
get
a
few
miles
offshore
and
then
blow
up
we
must
lost
a
dozen
planes
that
way
then
it
broke
there
was
a
guy
a
sergeant
in
the
maintenance
crew
who
was
sticking
a
hand
grenade
up
in
the
nose
wheel
wells
german
he
was
and
very
tidy
about
it
and
nobody
suspected
him
everything
looked
okay
and
tested
okay
but
when
the
ship
was
well
away
and
the
crew
pulled
up
the
wheels
that
tightened
a
string
and
it
pulled
the
pin
out
of
the
grenade
it
went
off
the
master
mechanic
finally
caught
him
and
nearly
killed
him
before
the
mps
could
stop
him
we
got
to
be
plenty
careful
whether
the
ground
crews
like
it
or
not
joe
said
drily
you
were
except
when
they
were
topping
off
you
took
that
for
granted
he
told
about
the
man
he
had
time
to
stick
anything
in
the
wheel
well
though
he
added
the
blinked
then
he
looked
annoyed
confound
it
i
watch
did
you
the
pilot
shook
his
head
his
lips
compressed
the
said
bitterly
and
i
thought
i
was
thanks
for
telling
me
fella
no
harm
done
this
time
but
that
was
a
slip
he
scowled
at
the
dials
before
him
the
plane
flew
on
this
was
the
last
leg
of
the
trip
and
now
it
should
be
no
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
before
they
reached
their
destination
joe
felt
a
lift
of
elation
the
space
platform
was
a
realization
or
the
beginning
of
it
of
a
dream
that
had
been
joe
since
he
was
a
very
small
boy
it
was
also
the
dream
of
most
other
small
boys
at
the
time
the
space
platform
would
make
space
travel
possible
of
course
it
would
make
journeys
to
the
moon
or
planets
itself
but
it
would
sail
splendidly
about
the
earth
in
an
orbit
some
four
thousand
miles
up
and
it
would
gird
the
world
in
four
hours
fourteen
minutes
and
seconds
it
would
carry
guided
missiles
and
every
city
in
the
world
would
be
defenseless
against
it
nobody
could
even
hope
for
world
domination
so
long
as
it
floated
on
its
celestial
round
which
naturally
was
why
there
were
such
desperate
efforts
to
destroy
it
before
its
completion
but
joe
thinking
about
the
platform
did
not
think
about
it
as
a
weapon
it
was
the
first
rung
on
the
stepladder
to
the
stars
from
it
the
moon
would
be
reached
certainly
mars
next
most
likely
then
venus
in
time
the
moons
of
saturn
and
the
twilight
zone
of
mercury
and
some
day
the
moons
of
jupiter
possibly
a
landing
could
be
dared
on
that
giant
planet
itself
despite
its
gravity
the
spoke
suddenly
how
do
you
rate
this
trip
by
cargo
plane
he
asked
curiously
mostly
even
generals
have
to
go
on
the
ground
you
rate
plenty
how
joe
pulled
his
thoughts
back
from
satisfied
imagining
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
remarkable
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
accompany
the
gyros
from
the
plant
to
their
destination
his
family
firm
had
built
them
so
it
had
seemed
natural
to
him
he
was
used
to
the
idea
that
everybody
looked
suspicious
to
a
security
officer
concerned
with
the
safety
of
the
platform
connections
i
have
any
said
joe
then
he
said
i
do
know
somebody
on
the
job
there
a
major
holt
out
there
he
might
have
cleared
me
known
my
family
for
years
yeah
said
the
drily
he
might
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
senior
security
officer
for
the
whole
job
he
in
charge
of
everything
from
the
security
guards
to
the
radar
screens
and
the
umbrella
and
the
checking
of
the
men
who
work
in
the
shed
if
he
says
you
all
right
you
probably
are
joe
had
meant
to
seem
impressive
he
explained
i
do
know
him
too
well
he
knows
my
father
and
his
daughter
sally
been
kicking
around
underfoot
most
of
my
life
i
taught
her
how
to
shoot
and
she
a
better
shot
than
i
am
she
was
a
nice
kid
when
she
was
little
i
got
to
like
her
when
she
fell
out
of
a
tree
and
broke
her
arm
and
did
even
whimper
that
shows
how
long
ago
it
was
he
grinned
she
was
trying
to
act
last
time
i
saw
her
the
nodded
there
was
a
brisk
chirping
sound
somewhere
the
pilot
reached
ahead
to
the
knob
the
plane
changed
course
sunshine
shifted
as
it
poured
into
the
cabin
the
ship
was
running
on
automatic
pilot
well
above
the
cloud
level
and
at
an
number
of
thousands
of
feet
altitude
as
was
suitable
for
planes
traveling
south
or
west
now
it
droned
on
its
new
course
degrees
from
the
original
joe
found
himself
guessing
that
one
of
the
security
provisions
for
planes
approaching
the
platform
might
be
that
they
should
not
come
too
near
on
a
direct
line
to
it
lest
they
give
information
to
curious
persons
on
the
ground
time
went
on
joe
slipped
gradually
back
to
his
meditations
about
the
platform
there
was
always
in
his
mind
the
picture
of
a
thing
shining
in
blinding
sunlight
between
earth
and
moon
but
he
began
to
remember
things
he
had
paid
too
much
attention
to
before
opposition
to
the
bare
idea
of
a
space
platform
for
instance
from
the
moment
it
was
first
proposed
every
dictator
protested
bitterly
even
politicians
out
of
office
found
it
a
subject
for
harangues
the
nationalistic
political
parties
the
peddlers
of
hate
the
entrepreneurs
of
discord
every
crank
in
the
world
had
something
to
say
against
the
platform
from
the
first
when
they
did
not
roundly
denounce
it
as
impious
they
raved
that
it
was
a
scheme
by
which
the
united
states
would
put
itself
in
position
to
rule
all
the
earth
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
united
states
had
first
proposed
it
as
a
united
nations
enterprise
so
that
denunciations
that
politicians
found
good
politics
actually
made
very
poor
sense
but
it
did
not
get
past
the
general
assembly
the
proposal
was
so
rabidly
attacked
on
every
side
that
it
was
not
even
passed
up
to
the
council
where
it
would
certainly
have
been
vetoed
anyhow
but
it
was
exactly
that
furious
denunciation
which
put
the
platform
through
the
united
states
congress
which
had
to
find
the
money
for
its
construction
in
joe
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
most
of
those
who
hoped
for
it
from
the
beginning
the
platform
great
appeal
was
that
it
was
the
necessary
first
step
toward
interplanetary
travel
with
star
ships
yet
to
come
but
most
scientists
wanted
it
desperately
for
their
own
ends
there
were
experiments
electronic
experiments
weather
observations
measurements
astronomical
observations
any
man
in
any
field
of
science
could
name
reasons
for
it
to
be
built
even
the
atom
scientists
had
one
and
nearly
the
best
their
argument
was
that
there
were
new
developments
of
nuclear
theory
that
needed
to
be
tried
out
but
should
not
be
tried
out
on
earth
there
were
some
reactions
that
ought
to
yield
unlimited
power
for
all
the
world
from
really
abundant
materials
but
there
was
one
chance
in
fifty
that
they
would
be
safe
just
because
the
materials
were
so
abundant
no
sane
man
would
risk
a
chance
of
destroying
earth
and
all
its
people
yet
those
reactions
should
be
tried
in
a
space
ship
some
millions
of
miles
out
in
emptiness
they
could
be
either
they
be
safe
or
they
would
not
but
the
only
way
to
get
a
space
ship
a
safe
enough
distance
from
earth
was
to
make
a
space
platform
as
a
starting
point
then
a
ship
could
shoot
away
from
earth
with
effectively
zero
gravity
and
full
fuel
tanks
the
platform
should
be
built
so
civilization
could
surge
ahead
to
new
heights
but
despite
these
excellent
reasons
it
was
the
platform
enemies
who
really
got
it
built
the
american
congress
would
never
have
appropriated
funds
for
a
platform
for
pure
scientific
research
no
matter
what
peacetime
benefits
it
promised
it
was
the
vehemence
of
those
who
hated
it
that
sold
it
to
congress
as
a
measure
for
national
defense
and
in
a
sense
it
was
these
were
ironic
aspects
joe
had
thought
about
before
just
as
he
had
thought
about
the
need
to
defend
the
platform
while
it
was
being
built
defending
it
was
sally
father
job
and
he
would
have
a
popular
time
joe
wondered
idly
how
sally
liked
living
out
where
the
most
important
job
on
earth
was
being
done
she
was
a
nice
kid
he
remembered
appreciatively
that
she
grown
up
to
be
a
very
girl
he
tended
to
remember
her
mostly
as
the
tomboy
who
could
beat
him
swimming
but
the
last
time
he
seen
her
come
to
think
of
it
been
startled
to
observe
how
pretty
she
grown
he
did
know
anybody
who
ought
to
be
she
was
a
really
swell
girl
he
came
to
himself
again
there
was
a
change
in
the
look
of
the
sky
ahead
there
was
no
actual
horizon
of
course
there
was
a
white
haze
that
blended
imperceptibly
into
the
cloud
layer
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
where
the
sky
ended
and
the
clouds
or
earth
began
but
presently
there
were
holes
in
the
clouds
the
ship
droned
on
and
suddenly
it
floated
over
the
edge
of
such
a
hole
and
looking
down
was
very
much
like
looking
over
the
edge
of
a
cliff
at
solid
earth
illimitably
far
below
the
holes
increased
in
number
then
there
were
no
holes
at
all
but
only
clouds
breaking
up
the
clear
view
of
the
ground
beneath
and
presently
again
even
the
clouds
were
left
behind
and
the
air
was
clear
but
still
there
was
no
horizon
and
there
was
brownish
earth
with
small
green
patches
and
beyond
was
sere
brown
range
at
seventeen
thousand
feet
there
were
simply
no
details
soon
the
clouds
were
merely
a
elevation
of
the
white
haze
to
the
sides
and
behind
and
then
there
came
a
new
sound
above
the
droning
roar
of
the
motors
joe
heard
it
and
then
he
saw
something
had
flashed
down
from
nowhere
it
flashed
on
ahead
and
banked
steeply
it
was
a
fighter
jet
and
for
an
instant
joe
saw
the
distant
range
seem
to
ripple
and
dance
in
its
exhaust
blast
it
circled
watchfully
the
transport
pilot
manipulated
something
there
was
a
change
in
the
sound
of
the
motors
joe
followed
the
eyes
the
jet
fighter
was
coming
up
astern
dive
brakes
extended
to
reduce
its
speed
it
overhauled
the
transport
very
slowly
and
then
the
transport
pilot
touched
one
of
the
separate
gently
and
again
and
again
joe
looking
at
the
jet
saw
it
through
the
whirling
blades
there
was
an
extraordinary
stroboscopic
effect
one
of
the
two
starboard
propellers
seen
through
the
other
abruptly
took
on
a
look
which
was
not
that
of
mistiness
at
all
but
of
writhing
gyrating
solidity
the
peculiar
appearance
vanished
and
came
again
and
vanished
and
appeared
yet
again
before
it
disappeared
completely
the
jet
shot
on
ahead
its
dive
brakes
retracted
it
made
a
graceful
wallowing
shallow
dive
and
then
climbed
almost
vertically
it
went
out
of
sight
visual
check
said
the
drily
to
joe
we
had
a
signal
to
give
individual
to
this
plane
we
did
tell
it
to
you
you
duplicate
it
joe
worked
it
out
painfully
the
visual
effect
of
one
propeller
seen
through
another
that
was
identification
it
was
not
a
type
of
signaling
an
unauthorized
or
uninformed
passenger
would
expect
also
said
the
we
have
a
television
camera
in
the
instrument
board
yonder
we
turned
it
on
now
the
interior
of
the
cabin
is
being
watched
from
the
ground
no
more
tricks
like
the
phony
colonel
and
the
atom
bomb
that
did
joe
sat
quite
still
he
noticed
that
the
plane
was
slanting
gradually
downward
his
eyes
went
to
the
dial
that
showed
descent
at
somewhere
between
two
and
three
hundred
feet
a
minute
that
was
for
his
benefit
the
cabin
was
pressurized
though
it
did
not
attempt
to
simulate
pressure
it
was
a
good
deal
better
than
the
outside
air
however
and
yet
too
quick
a
descent
meant
discomfort
two
to
three
hundred
feet
per
minute
is
about
right
the
ground
took
on
features
small
gulleys
patches
of
coloration
too
small
to
be
seen
from
farther
up
the
feeling
of
speed
increased
after
long
minutes
the
plane
was
only
a
few
thousand
feet
up
the
pilot
took
over
manual
control
from
the
automatic
pilot
he
seemed
to
wait
there
was
a
plaintive
mechanical
and
he
changed
course
you
see
the
shed
in
a
minute
or
two
said
the
he
added
vexedly
as
if
the
thing
had
been
bothering
him
i
wish
i
had
missed
that
guy
putting
his
hand
in
the
wheel
well
nothing
happened
but
i
should
have
missed
it
joe
watched
very
very
far
away
there
were
mountains
but
he
suddenly
realized
the
remarkable
flatness
of
the
ground
over
which
they
were
flying
from
the
edge
of
the
world
behind
to
the
very
edge
of
these
hills
the
ground
was
flat
there
were
gullies
and
depressions
here
and
there
but
no
hills
it
was
flat
flat
flat
the
plane
flew
on
there
was
a
tiny
glimmer
of
sunlight
joe
strained
his
eyes
the
sunlight
glinted
from
the
tiniest
possible
round
pip
on
the
brown
earth
it
grew
as
the
plane
flew
on
it
was
half
a
cherry
stone
it
was
half
an
orange
with
gores
it
was
the
top
section
of
a
sphere
that
was
simply
too
huge
to
have
been
made
by
men
there
was
a
thin
thread
of
white
that
ran
across
the
range
and
reached
that
and
then
ended
it
was
a
highway
joe
realized
that
the
was
the
shed
the
monstrous
building
made
for
the
construction
of
the
space
platform
it
was
gigantic
it
was
colossal
it
was
the
most
stupendous
thing
that
men
had
ever
created
joe
saw
a
tiny
projection
near
the
base
of
it
it
was
an
office
building
for
clerks
and
timekeepers
and
other
workers
he
strained
his
eyes
again
and
saw
a
motor
truck
on
the
highway
it
looked
extraordinarily
flat
then
he
saw
that
it
was
a
single
truck
but
a
convoy
of
them
a
long
way
back
the
white
highway
was
marked
by
a
tiny
dot
that
was
a
motor
bus
there
was
no
sign
of
activity
anywhere
because
the
scale
was
so
great
movement
there
was
but
the
things
that
moved
were
too
small
to
be
seen
by
comparison
with
the
shed
the
huge
round
shining
of
metal
stood
tranquilly
in
the
midst
of
emptiness
it
was
bigger
than
the
pyramids
the
plane
went
on
descending
joe
craned
his
neck
and
then
he
was
ashamed
to
gawk
he
looked
ahead
and
far
away
there
were
white
speckles
that
would
be
buildings
bootstrap
the
town
especially
built
for
the
men
who
built
the
space
platform
in
it
they
slept
and
ate
and
engaged
in
the
uproarious
festivity
that
men
on
a
construction
job
crave
on
their
time
off
the
plane
dipped
noticeably
airfield
off
to
the
right
said
the
that
for
the
town
and
the
job
the
jets
there
an
air
umbrella
overhead
all
the
time
have
a
field
somewhere
else
the
pushpots
have
a
field
of
their
own
too
where
they
training
pilots
joe
did
know
what
a
pushpot
was
but
he
did
ask
he
was
thinking
about
the
shed
which
was
the
greatest
building
ever
put
up
and
had
been
built
merely
to
shelter
the
greatest
hope
for
the
world
peace
while
it
was
put
together
he
be
in
the
shed
presently
he
work
there
setting
up
the
contents
of
the
crates
back
in
the
cargo
space
and
finally
installing
them
in
the
platform
itself
the
pilot
said
pitot
and
wing
heaters
off
said
the
spark
and
advance
joe
did
listen
he
looked
down
at
the
sprawling
small
town
with
barracks
and
a
business
section
and
an
obvious
carefully
designed
recreation
area
that
nobody
would
ever
use
the
plane
was
making
a
great
the
motor
noise
dimmed
as
joe
became
absorbed
in
his
anticipation
of
seeing
the
space
platform
and
having
a
hand
in
its
building
the
said
sharply
hold
everything
joe
jerked
his
head
around
the
had
his
hand
on
the
wheel
release
his
face
was
tense
it
do
feel
right
he
said
very
very
quietly
maybe
i
crazy
but
there
was
that
guy
who
put
his
hand
up
in
the
wheel
well
back
at
that
last
field
and
this
do
feel
right
the
plane
swept
on
the
airfield
passed
below
it
the
very
cautiously
let
go
of
the
wheel
release
which
when
pulled
should
let
the
wheels
fall
down
from
their
wells
to
lock
themselves
in
landing
position
he
moved
from
his
seat
his
lips
were
pinched
and
tight
he
scrabbled
at
a
metal
plate
in
the
flooring
he
lifted
it
and
looked
down
a
moment
later
he
had
a
flashlight
joe
saw
the
edge
of
a
mirror
there
were
two
mirrors
down
there
in
fact
one
could
look
through
both
of
them
into
the
wheel
well
the
made
quite
sure
he
stood
up
leaving
the
plate
off
the
opening
in
the
floor
there
something
down
in
the
wheel
well
he
said
in
a
brittle
tone
it
looks
to
me
like
a
grenade
there
a
string
tied
to
it
at
a
guess
that
guy
set
it
up
like
that
saboteur
sergeant
down
in
brazil
only
it
rolled
a
little
and
this
one
goes
off
when
the
wheels
go
down
i
think
too
if
we
better
go
around
again
huh
the
pilot
nodded
first
he
said
evenly
we
get
word
down
to
the
ground
about
the
guy
so
they
get
him
regardless
he
picked
up
the
microphone
hanging
above
and
behind
him
and
began
to
speak
coldly
into
it
the
transport
plane
started
to
swing
in
wide
sweeping
circles
over
the
desert
beyond
the
airport
while
the
pilot
explained
that
there
was
a
grenade
in
the
nose
wheel
well
set
to
explode
if
the
wheel
were
let
down
or
undoubtedly
if
the
ship
came
in
to
a
belly
landing
joe
found
himself
astonishingly
unafraid
but
he
was
filled
with
a
pounding
rage
he
hated
the
people
who
wanted
to
smash
the
pilot
gyros
because
they
were
essential
to
the
space
platform
he
hated
them
more
completely
than
he
had
known
he
could
hate
anybody
he
was
so
filled
with
fury
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
in
any
crash
or
explosive
landing
that
would
ruin
the
gyros
he
would
automatically
be
killed
the
pilot
made
an
examination
down
the
hole
with
a
flashlight
to
see
by
and
two
mirrors
to
show
him
the
contents
of
a
spot
he
could
not
possibly
reach
with
any
instrument
joe
heard
his
report
made
to
the
ground
by
radio
it
a
grenade
he
said
coldly
it
took
time
to
fix
it
the
way
it
is
at
a
guess
the
ship
was
at
the
time
of
its
last
overhaul
but
it
was
arranged
that
the
booby
trap
had
to
be
set
the
trigger
cocked
by
somebody
doing
something
very
simple
at
a
different
place
and
later
on
we
been
flying
with
that
grenade
in
the
wheel
well
for
two
weeks
but
it
was
out
of
sight
today
back
at
the
airfield
a
man
reached
up
and
pulled
a
string
he
knew
how
to
find
that
loosened
a
slipknot
the
grenade
rolled
down
to
a
new
position
now
when
the
wheel
goes
down
the
pin
is
pulled
you
can
figure
things
out
from
that
it
was
an
excellent
sabotage
device
if
a
ship
blew
up
two
weeks
after
overhaul
it
would
not
be
guessed
that
the
bomb
had
been
placed
so
long
before
every
search
would
be
made
for
a
recent
opportunity
for
the
bomb
placing
a
man
who
merely
reached
in
and
pulled
a
string
that
armed
the
bomb
and
made
it
ready
for
firing
would
never
be
suspected
there
might
be
dozens
of
planes
now
carrying
their
own
destruction
about
with
them
the
pilot
said
into
the
microphone
probably
he
listened
very
well
sir
he
turned
away
and
nodded
to
the
now
savagely
keeping
the
ship
in
wide
sweeping
circles
the
rims
of
which
barely
touched
the
farthermost
corner
of
the
airport
on
the
ground
below
we
authority
to
jump
he
said
briefly
you
know
where
the
chutes
are
but
there
a
chance
i
can
without
that
grenade
blowing
i
going
to
try
that
the
said
angrily
i
get
him
a
chute
he
indicated
joe
and
said
furiously
they
been
known
to
try
two
or
three
tricks
just
to
make
sure
ask
if
we
should
dump
cargo
before
we
the
pilot
held
up
the
microphone
again
he
spoke
he
listened
okay
to
dump
stuff
to
lighten
ship
you
wo
dump
my
crates
snapped
joe
and
i
staying
to
see
you
do
if
you
can
ride
this
ship
down
so
can
i
the
got
up
and
scowled
at
him
anything
i
can
move
out
goes
will
you
help
joe
followed
him
through
the
door
into
the
cargo
compartment
the
space
there
was
very
considerable
and
bitterly
cold
the
crates
from
the
kenmore
plant
were
the
heaviest
items
of
cargo
other
objects
were
smaller
the
made
his
way
to
the
rear
and
pulled
a
lever
great
curved
doors
opened
at
the
back
of
the
plane
instantly
there
was
such
a
bellowing
of
motors
that
all
speech
was
impossible
the
pulled
out
a
clip
of
slips
and
checked
one
with
the
nearest
movable
parcel
he
painstakingly
made
a
check
mark
and
began
to
push
the
box
toward
the
doors
it
was
not
a
conspicuously
sane
operation
so
near
the
ground
the
plane
tended
to
waver
the
air
was
distinctly
bumpy
to
push
a
massive
box
out
a
doorway
so
it
would
tumble
down
a
thousand
feet
to
desert
sands
was
not
so
safe
a
matter
as
would
let
it
become
tedious
but
joe
helped
they
got
the
box
to
the
door
and
shoved
it
out
it
went
spinning
down
the
hung
onto
the
doorframe
and
watched
it
land
he
chose
another
box
he
checked
it
and
another
joe
helped
they
got
them
out
of
the
door
and
dropping
dizzily
through
emptiness
the
plane
soared
on
in
circles
the
desert
as
seen
through
the
opened
clamshell
doors
reeled
away
astern
and
then
seemed
to
tilt
and
reeled
away
again
joe
and
the
labored
furiously
but
the
checked
each
item
before
he
jettisoned
it
it
was
a
singularly
deliberate
way
to
dump
cargo
to
destruction
a
box
over
the
edge
of
the
cargo
space
floor
a
piece
of
machinery
visible
through
its
crate
a
box
marked
each
one
checked
off
each
one
dumped
to
drop
a
thousand
feet
or
more
a
small
crated
dynamo
this
item
and
that
a
crate
marked
it
would
be
printed
forms
for
the
timekeepers
perhaps
but
it
was
it
dropped
out
the
plane
bellowed
on
and
suddenly
there
was
a
burst
of
flame
on
the
desert
below
the
box
that
should
have
contained
timecards
had
contained
something
very
much
more
explosive
as
the
plane
roared
on
rocking
from
the
shock
wave
of
the
explosion
joe
saw
a
crater
and
a
boiling
cloud
of
smoke
and
flying
sand
the
spoke
explosively
and
furiously
in
the
blasting
uproar
of
the
motors
he
vengefully
marked
the
waybill
of
the
parcel
that
had
exploded
but
then
they
went
back
to
the
job
of
dumping
cargo
they
worked
well
as
a
team
now
in
no
more
than
minutes
everything
was
out
except
the
four
crates
that
were
the
gyros
the
regarded
them
dourly
and
joe
clenched
his
fists
the
closed
the
clamshell
doors
and
it
became
possible
to
hear
oneself
think
again
ship
lighter
anyhow
reported
the
back
in
the
cabin
tell
this
is
what
exploded
the
pilot
took
the
slip
he
plucked
down
the
microphone
exactly
like
somebody
picking
up
an
interoffice
telephone
and
reported
the
waybill
number
and
description
of
the
case
that
had
been
an
extra
bomb
the
ship
carrying
the
pilot
gyros
had
been
probably
with
a
number
of
other
ships
and
a
bomb
had
been
shipped
on
it
and
a
special
saboteur
with
a
private
plane
had
shot
at
it
with
rockets
the
pilot
gyros
were
critical
devices
they
had
to
be
on
board
the
platform
when
it
took
off
and
they
took
months
to
make
and
balance
there
had
been
extra
pains
taken
to
prevent
their
arrival
i
dumping
gas
now
said
the
pilot
into
the
microphone
and
then
coming
in
for
a
belly
landing
the
ship
flew
straightaway
it
flew
more
lightly
and
it
bounced
a
little
when
gas
is
dumped
one
has
to
slow
to
not
more
than
one
hundred
and
knots
and
fly
level
then
one
is
supposed
to
fly
five
minutes
after
dumping
with
the
chutes
in
the
drain
position
and
even
then
there
is
minutes
of
flying
fuel
still
in
the
tanks
the
ship
swept
around
and
headed
back
for
the
now
field
it
went
slowly
lower
and
lower
and
lower
until
it
seemed
barely
to
skim
the
minor
irregularities
in
the
ground
and
low
like
this
the
effect
of
speed
was
terrific
the
thought
of
something
quickly
he
went
back
into
the
cargo
space
he
returned
with
an
armful
of
blankets
he
dumped
them
on
the
floor
if
that
grenade
does
go
he
said
sourly
joe
helped
in
the
few
minutes
before
bootstrap
loomed
near
they
filled
the
bottom
of
the
cabin
with
blankets
especially
around
the
chairs
and
there
was
a
mound
of
blanketing
above
the
actual
place
where
the
grenade
might
be
it
made
sense
soft
stuff
like
blankets
would
absorb
an
explosion
better
than
anything
else
but
the
pilot
thought
the
grenade
might
not
blow
hold
fast
snapped
the
pilot
the
wing
flaps
were
down
that
slowed
the
ship
a
little
it
had
been
lightened
that
helped
they
went
in
over
the
edge
of
the
field
less
than
high
joe
found
his
hands
closing
convulsively
on
a
handgrip
he
saw
a
crash
wagon
starting
out
from
the
side
of
the
runway
a
fire
truck
started
for
the
line
the
plane
followed
four
feet
above
the
rushing
sand
three
the
pilot
eased
back
the
stick
his
face
was
craggy
and
very
grim
and
very
hard
the
ship
tail
went
down
and
dragged
it
bumped
then
the
plane
careened
and
slid
and
crazily
and
then
the
world
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
crashes
bangs
shrieks
of
torn
metal
bumps
thumps
and
grindings
then
a
roaring
joe
pulled
himself
loose
from
where
he
had
been
flung
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
peeled
himself
loose
and
found
the
pilot
struggling
up
and
he
grabbed
him
to
help
and
the
hauled
at
them
both
and
abruptly
all
three
of
them
were
in
the
open
air
and
running
at
full
speed
away
from
the
ship
the
roar
abruptly
became
a
bellowing
there
was
an
explosion
flames
sprouted
everywhere
the
three
men
ran
stumblingly
but
even
as
they
ran
the
swore
we
left
something
he
panted
joe
heard
a
crescendo
of
booming
crackling
noises
behind
something
else
exploded
dully
but
he
should
be
far
enough
away
by
now
he
turned
to
look
and
he
saw
blackening
wreckage
immersed
in
roaring
flames
the
flames
were
monstrous
they
rose
it
seemed
more
flames
than
minutes
of
gasoline
should
have
produced
as
he
looked
something
blew
up
shatteringly
and
fire
raged
even
more
furiously
of
course
in
such
heat
the
delicately
adjusted
gyros
would
be
warped
and
ruined
even
if
the
crash
had
wrecked
them
beforehand
joe
made
thick
incoherent
sounds
of
rage
the
plane
was
now
an
incomplete
twisted
skeleton
licked
through
by
flames
the
crash
wagon
roared
to
a
stop
beside
them
anybody
hurt
anybody
left
inside
joe
shook
his
head
unable
to
speak
for
despairing
rage
the
fog
wagon
roared
up
already
spouting
mist
from
its
nozzles
its
tanks
contained
water
treated
with
detergent
so
that
it
broke
into
the
finest
of
droplets
when
sprayed
at
four
hundred
pounds
pressure
it
drenched
the
burning
wreck
with
that
heavy
mist
in
which
a
man
would
drown
no
fire
could
possibly
sustain
itself
in
seconds
it
seemed
there
were
only
steam
and
white
vapor
and
fumes
of
smoldering
substances
that
gradually
lessened
but
then
there
was
a
roaring
of
motorcycles
racing
across
the
field
with
a
black
car
trailing
them
the
car
pulled
up
beside
the
fog
wagon
then
sped
swiftly
to
where
joe
was
coming
out
of
wild
rage
and
sinking
into
sick
black
depression
he
been
responsible
for
the
pilot
gyros
and
their
safe
arrival
what
had
happened
was
his
fault
but
it
was
not
his
job
merely
to
remain
blameless
it
was
his
job
to
get
the
gyros
delivered
and
set
up
in
the
space
platform
he
had
failed
the
black
car
braked
to
a
stop
there
was
major
holt
joe
had
seen
him
six
months
before
he
aged
a
good
deal
he
looked
grimly
at
the
two
pilots
what
happened
he
demanded
you
dumped
your
fuel
what
burned
like
this
joe
said
thickly
everything
was
dumped
but
the
pilot
gyros
they
did
burn
they
were
packed
at
the
plant
the
suddenly
made
an
incoherent
sound
of
rage
i
got
it
he
said
hoarsely
i
know
what
snapped
major
holt
they
planted
that
grenade
at
the
major
overhaul
panted
the
too
enraged
even
to
swear
they
fixed
it
so
any
trouble
would
mean
a
wreck
and
i
pulled
the
releases
just
as
we
hit
for
all
compartments
to
flood
everything
with
but
it
was
that
what
burned
major
holt
stared
sharply
at
him
he
held
up
his
hand
somebody
materialized
beside
him
he
said
harshly
get
the
extinguisher
bottles
sealed
and
take
them
to
the
laboratory
yes
sir
a
man
went
running
toward
the
wreck
major
holt
said
coldly
that
a
new
one
we
should
have
thought
of
it
you
men
get
yourselves
attended
to
and
report
to
security
at
the
shed
the
pilot
and
turned
away
joe
turned
to
go
with
them
then
he
heard
sally
voice
a
little
bit
wobbly
joe
come
with
us
please
joe
had
seen
her
but
she
was
in
the
car
she
was
pale
her
eyes
were
wide
and
frightened
joe
said
stiffly
i
be
all
right
i
want
to
look
at
those
crates
major
holt
said
curtly
they
already
under
guard
there
have
to
be
photographs
made
before
anything
can
be
touched
and
i
want
a
report
from
you
anyhow
come
along
joe
looked
the
motorcycles
were
abandoned
and
there
were
already
armed
guards
around
the
wreck
grimly
watching
the
men
of
the
fog
wagon
as
they
hunted
for
remaining
sparks
or
flame
it
was
noticeable
that
now
nobody
moved
toward
the
wreck
there
were
figures
walking
back
toward
the
edge
of
the
field
what
civilians
were
about
even
to
the
mechanics
on
duty
had
started
out
to
look
at
the
debris
at
close
range
but
the
guards
were
on
the
job
nobody
could
approach
the
onlookers
went
back
to
their
proper
places
please
joe
said
sally
shakily
joe
got
drearily
into
the
car
the
instant
he
seated
himself
it
was
in
motion
again
it
went
plunging
back
across
the
field
and
out
the
entrance
its
horn
blared
and
it
went
streaking
toward
the
town
and
abruptly
turned
to
the
left
in
seconds
it
was
on
a
broad
white
highway
that
left
the
town
behind
and
led
toward
the
emptiness
of
the
desert
but
not
quite
emptiness
far
far
away
there
was
a
great
rising
against
the
horizon
the
car
hummed
toward
it
tires
singing
and
joe
looked
at
it
and
felt
ashamed
because
this
was
the
home
of
the
space
platform
and
he
had
brought
to
it
the
part
for
which
he
alone
was
responsible
sally
moistened
her
lips
she
brought
out
a
small
box
she
opened
it
there
were
bandages
and
bottles
i
a
kit
joe
she
said
shakily
you
burned
let
me
fix
the
worst
ones
anyhow
joe
looked
at
himself
one
coat
sleeve
was
burned
to
charcoal
his
hair
was
singed
on
one
side
a
trouser
leg
was
burned
off
around
the
ankle
when
he
noticed
his
burns
hurt
major
holt
watched
her
spread
a
salve
on
scorched
skin
he
showed
no
emotion
whatever
tell
me
what
happened
he
commanded
all
of
it
somehow
there
seemed
very
little
to
tell
but
joe
told
it
baldly
as
the
car
sped
on
the
great
of
metal
loomed
larger
and
larger
but
did
not
appear
to
grow
nearer
as
sally
practiced
first
aid
they
came
to
a
convoy
of
trucks
and
the
horn
blared
and
they
turned
out
and
passed
it
once
they
met
a
convoy
of
empty
vehicles
on
the
way
back
to
bootstrap
they
passed
a
bus
they
went
on
joe
finished
drearily
the
pilots
did
everything
anybody
could
even
checked
off
the
packages
as
they
were
dumped
we
reported
the
one
that
blew
up
major
holt
said
uncompromisingly
those
were
orders
in
a
sense
gained
something
even
by
this
disaster
the
pilots
are
probably
right
about
the
plane
having
been
after
its
last
overhaul
and
the
traps
armed
later
i
have
an
inspection
made
immediately
and
we
see
if
we
can
find
how
it
was
done
there
the
man
you
think
armed
the
trap
on
this
plane
an
order
for
his
arrest
is
on
the
way
now
i
told
my
secretary
and
hm
that
i
did
understand
that
said
joe
drearily
planes
have
bottles
to
put
fires
out
said
the
major
impatiently
a
fire
in
flight
lights
a
red
warning
light
on
the
instrument
panel
telling
where
it
is
the
pilot
pulls
a
handle
and
floods
the
compartment
putting
it
out
and
this
ship
was
coming
in
for
a
crash
landing
so
the
pilot
according
to
orders
flooded
all
compartments
with
only
it
was
sally
said
in
horror
oh
no
the
bottles
were
filled
with
an
inflammable
or
an
explosive
gas
said
her
father
unbending
instead
of
making
a
fire
impossible
they
made
it
certain
we
have
to
watch
out
for
that
trick
now
too
joe
was
too
disheartened
for
any
emotion
except
a
bitter
depression
and
a
much
more
bitter
hatred
of
those
who
were
ready
to
commit
any
crime
and
had
committed
most
in
the
attempt
to
destroy
the
platform
the
shed
that
housed
it
rose
and
rose
against
the
skyline
it
became
huge
it
became
monstrous
it
became
unbelievable
but
joe
could
have
wept
when
the
car
pulled
up
at
an
angular
building
built
out
from
the
shed
base
from
the
air
this
substantial
building
had
looked
like
a
mere
chip
the
car
stopped
they
got
out
a
sentry
saluted
as
major
holt
led
the
way
inside
joe
and
sally
followed
the
major
said
curtly
to
a
uniformed
man
at
a
desk
get
some
clothes
for
this
man
get
him
a
telephone
connection
to
the
kenmore
precision
tool
company
let
him
talk
then
bring
him
to
me
again
he
disappeared
sally
tried
to
smile
at
joe
she
was
still
quite
pale
that
dad
joe
he
means
well
but
he
not
cordial
i
was
in
his
office
when
the
report
of
sabotage
to
your
plane
came
through
we
started
for
bootstrap
we
were
on
the
way
when
we
saw
the
first
explosion
i
thought
it
was
your
ship
she
winced
a
little
at
the
memory
i
knew
you
were
on
board
it
was
not
nice
joe
she
been
badly
scared
joe
wanted
to
thump
her
encouragingly
on
the
back
but
he
suddenly
realized
that
that
would
no
longer
be
appropriate
so
he
said
gruffly
i
all
right
he
followed
the
uniformed
man
he
began
to
get
out
of
his
scorched
and
tattered
garments
the
sergeant
brought
him
more
clothes
and
he
put
them
on
he
was
just
changing
his
personal
possessions
to
the
new
pockets
when
the
sergeant
came
back
again
kenmore
plant
on
the
line
sir
joe
went
to
the
phone
on
the
way
he
discovered
that
the
banging
around
he
had
when
the
plane
landed
had
made
a
number
of
places
on
his
body
hurt
he
talked
to
his
father
afterward
he
realized
that
it
was
a
queer
conversation
he
felt
guilty
because
something
had
happened
to
a
job
that
had
taken
eight
months
to
do
and
that
he
alone
was
escorting
to
its
destination
he
told
his
father
about
that
but
his
father
did
seem
concerned
not
nearly
so
much
concerned
as
he
should
have
been
he
asked
urgent
questions
about
joe
himself
if
he
was
hurt
how
much
where
joe
was
astonished
that
his
father
seemed
to
think
such
matters
more
important
than
the
pilot
gyros
but
he
answered
the
questions
and
explained
the
exact
situation
and
also
a
certain
desperate
hope
he
was
trying
to
cherish
that
the
gyros
might
still
be
repairable
his
father
gave
him
advice
sally
was
waiting
again
when
he
came
out
she
took
him
into
her
office
and
introduced
him
to
her
father
secretary
compared
to
sally
she
was
an
extraordinarily
plain
woman
she
wore
a
sorrowful
expression
but
she
looked
very
efficient
joe
explained
carefully
that
his
father
said
for
him
to
hunt
up
chief
bender
working
on
the
job
out
here
because
he
was
one
of
the
few
men
who
left
the
kenmore
plant
to
work
elsewhere
and
he
was
good
he
and
the
chief
between
them
would
estimate
the
damage
and
the
possibility
of
repair
major
holt
listened
he
was
military
and
official
and
harassed
and
curt
and
tired
joe
known
sally
and
therefore
her
father
all
his
life
but
the
major
was
an
easy
man
to
be
relaxed
with
he
spoke
into
thin
air
and
immediately
his
secretary
wrote
out
a
pass
for
joe
then
major
holt
gave
crisp
orders
on
a
telephone
and
asked
questions
and
sally
said
i
know
i
take
him
there
i
know
my
way
around
her
father
expression
did
not
change
he
simply
included
sally
in
his
orders
on
the
phone
he
hung
up
and
said
briefly
the
plane
will
be
surveyed
and
taken
apart
as
soon
as
possible
by
the
time
you
find
your
man
you
can
probably
examine
the
crates
i
have
you
cleared
for
it
his
secretary
reached
in
a
drawer
for
order
forms
to
fill
out
and
hand
him
to
sign
sally
tugged
at
joe
arm
they
left
outside
she
said
there
no
use
arguing
with
my
father
joe
he
has
a
terrible
job
and
it
on
his
mind
all
the
time
he
hates
being
a
security
officer
too
it
a
thankless
job
and
no
security
officer
ever
gets
to
be
more
than
a
major
his
ability
never
shows
what
he
does
is
never
noticed
unless
it
fails
so
he
frustrated
he
got
poor
miss
ross
his
secretary
you
know
so
she
just
listens
to
what
he
says
must
be
done
and
she
writes
it
out
sometimes
he
goes
days
without
speaking
to
her
directly
but
really
it
pretty
bad
it
like
a
war
with
no
enemy
to
fight
except
spies
and
the
things
they
do
they
been
known
even
to
a
truck
after
an
accident
so
anybody
who
tries
to
help
will
be
blown
up
so
everything
has
to
be
done
in
a
certain
way
or
everything
will
be
ruined
she
led
him
to
an
office
with
a
door
that
opened
directly
into
the
shed
in
spite
of
his
bitterness
joe
was
morosely
impatient
to
see
inside
but
sally
had
to
identify
him
formally
as
the
joe
kenmore
who
was
the
subject
of
her
father
order
and
his
fingerprints
had
to
be
taken
and
somebody
had
him
stand
for
a
moment
before
an
screen
then
she
led
him
through
the
door
and
he
was
in
the
shed
where
the
space
platform
was
under
construction
it
was
a
vast
cavern
of
metal
sheathing
and
spidery
girders
filled
with
sound
and
detail
it
took
him
seconds
to
begin
to
absorb
what
he
saw
and
heard
the
shed
was
five
hundred
feet
high
in
the
middle
and
it
was
all
clear
space
without
a
single
column
or
interruption
there
were
arc
lamps
burning
about
its
edges
and
high
up
somewhere
there
were
strips
of
glass
which
let
in
a
pale
light
all
of
it
resounded
with
many
noises
and
clanging
echoes
of
them
there
were
rivet
guns
at
work
and
there
were
the
grumblings
of
motor
trucks
moving
about
and
the
oddly
harsh
roar
of
welding
torches
but
the
torch
flames
looked
only
like
marsh
fires
and
eerie
against
the
mass
of
the
thing
that
was
being
built
it
was
not
too
clear
to
the
eye
this
incomplete
space
platform
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
mist
a
glamour
about
it
which
was
partly
a
veiling
mass
of
scaffolding
but
joe
gazed
at
it
with
an
emotion
that
blotted
out
even
his
aching
disappointment
and
feeling
of
shame
it
was
gigantic
it
had
the
dimensions
of
an
ocean
liner
it
was
strangely
shaped
partly
obscured
by
the
framework
about
it
there
was
bright
plating
in
swelling
curves
and
the
plating
reached
up
irregularly
and
followed
a
peculiar
pattern
and
above
the
plating
there
were
girders
themselves
shining
brightly
in
the
light
of
many
arc
lamps
and
they
rose
up
and
up
toward
the
roof
of
the
shed
itself
the
platform
was
ungainly
and
it
was
huge
and
it
rested
under
a
hollow
metal
that
could
have
doubled
for
a
sky
it
was
more
than
three
hundred
feet
high
itself
and
there
were
men
working
on
the
bare
bright
beams
of
its
uppermost
parts
and
the
men
were
specks
the
far
side
of
the
shed
floor
had
other
men
on
it
and
they
were
merely
jerkily
moving
motes
you
could
see
their
legs
as
they
walked
the
shed
and
the
platform
were
monstrous
joe
felt
sally
eyes
upon
him
somehow
they
looked
proud
he
took
a
deep
breath
she
said
come
on
they
walked
across
acres
of
floor
neatly
paved
with
shining
wooden
blocks
they
moved
toward
the
thing
that
was
to
take
mankind
first
step
toward
the
stars
as
they
walked
centerward
a
big
outfit
backed
out
of
an
opening
under
the
lacy
haze
of
scaffolds
it
turned
clumsily
and
carefully
circled
the
scaffolding
and
moved
toward
a
sidewall
of
the
shed
a
section
of
the
wall
it
seemed
as
small
as
a
rabbit
hole
lifted
inward
like
a
flap
and
the
trundled
out
into
the
blazing
sunlight
four
other
trucks
scurried
out
after
it
other
trucks
came
in
the
sidewall
section
closed
there
was
the
smell
of
engine
fumes
and
hot
metal
and
of
ozone
from
electric
sparks
there
was
that
indescribable
smell
a
man
can
get
homesick
for
of
metal
being
worked
by
men
joe
walked
like
someone
in
a
dream
with
sally
satisfiedly
silent
beside
him
until
the
scaffolds
which
had
looked
like
veiling
became
latticework
and
he
saw
openings
they
walked
into
one
such
tunnel
the
bulk
of
the
platform
above
them
loomed
overhead
with
a
crushing
menace
there
were
trucks
rumbling
all
around
underneath
here
in
this
maze
of
scaffold
columns
some
carried
cages
waiting
to
be
snatched
up
by
hoists
crane
grips
came
down
and
snapped
fast
on
the
cages
and
lifted
them
up
and
up
and
out
of
sight
there
was
a
diesel
running
somewhere
and
a
man
stood
and
stared
skyward
and
made
motions
with
his
hands
and
the
diesel
adjusted
its
running
to
his
signals
then
some
empty
cages
came
down
and
landed
in
a
waiting
truck
body
with
loud
clanking
noises
somebody
cast
off
the
hooks
and
the
truck
grumbled
and
drove
away
sally
spoke
to
a
preoccupied
man
in
shirt
sleeves
with
a
badge
on
an
arm
band
near
his
shoulder
he
looked
carefully
at
the
passes
she
carried
using
a
flashlight
to
make
sure
then
he
led
them
to
a
shaft
up
which
a
hoist
ran
it
was
very
noisy
here
a
rivet
gun
banged
away
overhead
and
the
plates
of
the
platform
rang
with
the
sound
and
the
echoes
screeched
and
to
joe
the
bedlam
was
infinitely
good
to
hear
the
man
with
the
arm
band
shouted
into
a
telephone
transmitter
and
a
hoist
cage
came
down
joe
and
sally
stepped
on
it
joe
took
a
firm
grip
on
her
shoulder
and
the
hoist
shot
upward
the
hugeness
of
the
shed
and
the
platform
grew
even
more
apparent
as
the
hoist
accelerated
toward
the
roof
the
flooring
seemed
to
expand
spidery
scaffold
beams
dropped
past
them
there
were
things
being
built
over
by
the
sidewall
joe
saw
a
crawling
tow
truck
moving
past
those
enigmatic
objects
it
was
a
tiny
truck
no
more
than
four
feet
high
and
with
wheels
it
dragged
behind
it
flat
plates
of
metal
with
upturned
forward
edges
they
slid
over
the
floor
like
sledges
cryptic
loads
were
carried
on
those
plates
and
the
tow
truck
stopped
by
a
mass
of
steel
piping
being
put
together
and
began
to
unload
the
plates
then
the
hoist
slowed
abruptly
and
sally
winced
a
little
the
hoist
stopped
here
two
hundred
feet
up
a
welding
crew
worked
on
the
skin
of
the
platform
itself
the
plating
curved
in
and
there
was
a
wide
flat
space
parallel
to
the
ground
there
was
also
a
great
gaping
hole
beyond
though
girders
rose
roofward
even
yet
this
was
as
high
as
the
plating
had
gone
that
opening
joe
guessed
would
ultimately
be
the
door
of
an
air
lock
and
this
flat
surface
was
designed
for
a
tender
rocket
to
anchor
to
by
magnets
when
a
rocket
came
up
from
earth
with
supplies
or
reliefs
for
the
platform
crew
or
with
fuel
to
be
stored
for
an
exploring
ship
later
use
it
would
anchor
here
and
then
inch
toward
that
doorway
there
were
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
welding
crew
they
should
have
been
working
but
two
men
battered
savagely
at
each
other
their
tools
thrown
down
one
was
tall
and
lean
with
a
wrinkled
face
and
an
expression
of
intolerable
fury
the
other
was
squat
and
dark
with
a
look
of
desperation
a
third
man
was
in
the
act
of
putting
down
his
welding
torch
he
carefully
turned
it
off
first
to
try
to
interfere
another
man
gaped
still
another
was
climbing
up
by
a
ladder
from
the
scaffold
level
below
joe
put
sally
hand
on
the
hoist
upright
instinctively
freeing
himself
for
action
the
lanky
man
lashed
out
a
terrific
roundhouse
blow
it
landed
but
the
stocky
man
bored
in
joe
had
an
instant
clear
sight
of
his
face
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
man
enraged
it
had
the
look
of
a
man
both
desperate
and
despairing
then
the
lanky
man
foot
slipped
he
lost
balance
and
the
stocky
fist
landed
the
thin
man
reeled
backward
sally
cried
out
choking
the
lanky
man
teetered
on
the
edge
of
the
flat
place
behind
him
the
plating
curved
down
below
him
there
were
two
hundred
feet
of
fall
through
the
maze
of
scaffolds
if
he
took
one
step
back
he
was
gone
inexorably
down
a
slope
on
which
he
could
never
stop
he
took
that
step
the
stocky
man
face
abruptly
froze
in
horror
the
lanky
man
stiffened
convulsively
he
could
stop
he
knew
it
he
go
back
and
on
over
the
rounded
edge
and
fall
he
might
touch
the
scaffolding
it
would
not
stop
him
it
would
merely
set
his
body
spinning
crazily
as
it
dropped
and
crashed
again
and
again
before
it
landed
two
hundred
feet
below
it
was
horror
in
slow
motion
watching
the
lean
man
stagger
backward
to
his
death
then
joe
leaped
for
an
instant
in
joe
was
incongruously
aware
of
all
the
noises
in
the
shed
the
murky
girdered
ceiling
still
three
hundred
feet
above
him
the
swelling
curving
glittering
surface
of
steel
underneath
then
he
struck
he
landed
beside
the
lean
man
with
his
left
arm
outstretched
to
share
his
impetus
with
him
alone
he
would
have
had
momentum
enough
to
carry
himself
up
the
slope
down
which
the
man
had
begun
to
descend
but
now
he
shared
it
the
two
of
them
toppled
forward
together
their
arms
were
upon
the
flat
surface
while
their
bodies
dangled
the
feel
of
gravity
pulling
them
slantwise
and
downward
was
purest
nightmare
but
then
as
joe
innards
crawled
the
same
stocky
man
who
had
knocked
the
lean
man
back
was
dragging
frantically
at
both
of
them
to
pull
them
to
safety
then
there
were
two
men
pulling
the
stocky
man
face
was
gray
his
horror
was
proof
that
he
had
intended
murder
the
man
who
put
down
his
welding
torch
pulled
the
man
who
been
climbing
the
ladder
put
his
weight
to
the
task
of
getting
them
back
to
usable
footing
they
reached
safety
joe
scrambled
to
his
feet
but
he
felt
sick
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach
the
stocky
man
began
to
shake
horribly
the
lanky
one
advanced
furiously
upon
him
i
didn
mean
to
keel
you
haney
the
dark
one
panted
the
lanky
one
snapped
okay
you
did
but
come
on
now
we
finish
this
he
advanced
toward
the
workman
who
had
so
nearly
caused
his
death
but
the
other
man
dropped
his
arms
to
his
sides
i
don
fight
no
more
he
said
thickly
not
here
you
keel
me
is
okay
i
don
fight
the
lanky
man
haney
growled
at
him
tonight
then
in
bootstrap
now
get
back
to
work
the
stocky
man
picked
up
his
tools
he
was
trembling
haney
turned
to
joe
and
said
ungraciously
much
obliged
what
up
joe
still
felt
queasy
there
is
rarely
any
high
elation
after
one
has
risked
his
life
for
somebody
else
he
nearly
plunged
two
hundred
feet
to
the
floor
of
the
shed
with
haney
but
he
swallowed
i
looking
for
chief
bender
you
haney
foreman
gang
boss
said
haney
he
looked
at
joe
and
then
at
sally
who
was
holding
convulsively
to
the
upright
joe
had
put
her
hand
on
her
eyes
were
closed
yeah
said
haney
the
chief
took
off
today
some
kind
of
injun
stuff
funeral
maybe
want
me
to
tell
him
something
i
see
him
when
i
go
off
shift
there
was
an
obscure
movement
somewhere
on
this
part
of
the
platform
a
tiny
figure
came
out
of
a
crevice
that
would
someday
be
an
air
lock
joe
did
move
his
eyes
toward
it
he
said
awkwardly
just
tell
him
joe
kenmore
in
town
and
needs
him
he
remember
me
i
think
i
hunt
him
up
tonight
okay
said
haney
joe
eyes
went
to
the
tiny
figure
that
had
come
out
from
behind
the
plating
it
was
a
midget
in
baggy
stained
work
garments
like
the
rest
of
the
men
up
here
he
wore
a
miniature
welding
shield
pushed
back
on
his
head
joe
could
guess
his
function
of
course
there
be
corners
a
man
could
get
into
to
buck
a
rivet
or
weld
a
joint
there
be
places
only
a
tiny
man
could
properly
inspect
the
midget
regarded
joe
without
expression
joe
turned
to
the
hoist
to
go
down
to
the
floor
again
haney
waved
his
hand
the
midget
lifted
his
in
grave
salutation
the
hoist
dropped
down
the
shaft
sally
opened
her
eyes
you
saved
that
man
life
joe
she
said
unsteadily
but
you
scared
me
to
death
joe
tried
to
ignore
the
remark
but
he
still
seemed
to
feel
slanting
metal
under
him
and
a
drop
of
two
hundred
feet
below
it
had
been
a
nightmarish
sensation
i
did
think
he
said
uncomfortably
it
was
a
crazy
thing
to
do
lucky
it
worked
out
sally
glanced
at
him
the
hoist
still
dropped
swiftly
levels
of
scaffolding
shot
upward
past
them
if
joe
had
slipped
down
that
rolling
curve
of
metal
he
have
dropped
past
all
these
it
was
not
good
to
think
about
he
swallowed
again
then
the
hoist
checked
in
its
descent
it
stopped
joe
somewhat
absurdly
helped
sally
off
to
solid
ground
it
looks
to
me
said
sally
as
if
you
bound
to
make
me
see
somebody
killed
joe
would
you
mind
leading
a
little
bit
less
adventurous
life
for
a
while
while
i
around
he
managed
to
grin
but
he
still
did
not
feel
right
nothing
i
can
do
until
i
can
look
at
the
plane
he
said
changing
the
subject
and
i
ca
find
the
chief
until
tonight
could
we
sightsee
a
little
she
nodded
they
went
out
from
under
the
intricate
framework
that
upheld
the
platform
they
went
in
fact
completely
under
that
colossal
incomplete
object
sally
indicated
the
sidewall
let
go
look
at
the
pushpots
they
fascinating
she
led
the
way
the
enormous
spaciousness
of
the
shed
again
became
evident
there
was
a
catwalk
part
way
up
the
inward
curving
wall
someone
leaned
on
its
railing
and
surveyed
the
interior
of
the
shed
he
would
probably
be
a
security
man
maybe
the
fist
fight
up
on
the
platform
had
been
seen
or
maybe
not
the
man
on
the
catwalk
was
hardly
more
than
a
speck
and
it
occurred
to
joe
that
there
must
be
other
watchers
posts
high
up
on
the
outer
shell
where
men
could
search
the
sunlit
desert
outside
for
signs
of
danger
but
he
turned
and
looked
yearningly
back
at
the
monstrous
thing
under
the
mist
of
scaffolding
for
the
first
time
he
could
make
out
its
shape
it
was
something
like
an
egg
but
a
great
deal
more
like
something
he
could
put
a
name
to
actually
it
was
exactly
like
nothing
in
the
world
but
itself
and
when
it
was
out
in
space
there
would
be
nothing
left
on
earth
like
it
it
would
be
in
a
fashion
a
world
in
itself
independent
of
the
earth
that
made
it
there
would
be
hydroponic
tanks
in
which
plants
would
grow
to
purify
its
air
and
feed
its
crew
there
would
be
telescopes
with
which
men
would
be
able
to
study
the
stars
as
they
had
never
been
able
to
do
from
the
bottom
of
earth
ocean
of
turbulent
air
but
it
would
serve
earth
there
would
be
communicators
they
would
pick
up
microwave
messages
and
retransmit
them
to
destinations
far
around
the
curve
of
the
planet
or
else
store
them
and
retransmit
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
an
hour
or
two
hours
later
it
would
store
fuel
with
which
men
could
presently
set
out
for
the
stars
and
out
to
emptiness
for
nuclear
experiments
that
must
not
be
made
on
earth
and
finally
it
would
be
armed
with
squat
deadly
atomic
missiles
that
no
nation
could
possibly
defy
and
so
this
space
platform
would
keep
peace
on
earth
but
it
could
not
make
good
will
among
men
sally
walked
on
they
reached
the
mysterious
objects
being
manufactured
in
a
row
around
half
the
sidewall
of
the
shed
they
were
of
simple
design
and
by
comparison
not
unduly
large
the
first
objects
were
merely
frameworks
of
metal
pipe
which
men
were
welding
together
unbreakably
they
were
no
bigger
than
say
half
of
a
house
a
little
way
on
these
were
filled
with
intricate
arrays
of
tanks
and
piping
and
still
farther
there
was
a
truck
and
hoist
unloading
a
massive
object
into
place
right
now
there
were
huge
engines
fitting
precisely
into
openings
designed
to
hold
them
others
were
being
plated
in
with
metallic
skins
at
the
very
end
of
this
assembly
line
a
crane
was
loading
a
finished
object
onto
a
trailer
as
it
swung
in
the
air
joe
realized
what
it
was
it
might
be
called
a
jet
plane
but
it
was
not
of
any
type
ever
before
used
more
than
anything
else
it
looked
like
a
beetle
it
would
not
be
really
useful
for
anything
but
its
function
at
the
end
of
operation
stepladder
then
hundreds
of
these
ungainly
objects
would
cluster
upon
the
platform
sides
like
swarming
bees
they
would
thrust
savagely
up
with
their
separate
jet
engines
they
would
lift
the
platform
from
the
foundation
on
which
it
had
been
built
tugging
straining
panting
they
would
get
it
out
of
the
shed
but
their
work
would
not
end
there
holding
it
aloft
they
would
start
it
eastward
lifting
effortfully
they
would
carry
it
as
far
and
as
high
and
as
fast
as
their
straining
engines
could
work
then
there
would
be
one
last
surge
of
fierce
thrusting
with
oversize
jato
rockets
built
separately
into
each
pushpot
all
firing
at
once
finally
the
clumsy
things
would
drop
off
and
come
bumbling
back
home
while
the
platform
own
rockets
flared
out
their
flames
and
it
headed
up
for
emptiness
but
the
making
of
these
pushpots
and
all
the
other
multitudinous
activities
of
the
shed
would
have
no
meaning
if
the
contents
of
four
crates
in
the
wreckage
of
a
plane
could
not
be
salvaged
and
put
to
use
again
joe
said
restlessly
i
want
to
see
all
this
sally
and
maybe
anything
else
i
do
is
useless
but
i
got
to
find
out
what
happened
to
the
gyros
i
was
bringing
here
sally
said
nothing
she
turned
and
they
moved
across
the
long
long
space
of
flooring
toward
the
doorway
by
which
they
had
entered
and
now
that
he
had
seen
the
space
platform
all
of
feeling
of
guilt
and
despondency
came
back
it
seemed
unbearable
they
went
out
through
the
guarded
door
sally
surrendered
the
pass
and
joe
was
again
checked
carefully
before
he
was
free
to
go
then
sally
said
you
do
want
me
tagging
around
do
you
joe
said
honestly
it
is
exactly
that
sally
but
if
the
stuff
is
really
smashed
i
rather
not
have
anybody
see
me
please
do
be
angry
but
sally
said
quietly
i
know
i
get
somebody
to
drive
you
over
she
vanished
she
came
back
with
the
uniformed
man
who
driven
major
holt
she
put
her
hand
momentarily
on
joe
arm
if
it
really
bad
joe
tell
me
you
wo
let
yourself
cry
but
cry
for
you
she
searched
his
eyes
really
joe
he
grinned
feebly
and
went
out
to
the
car
the
feeling
on
the
way
to
the
airfield
was
not
a
good
one
it
was
miles
from
the
shed
but
joe
dreaded
what
he
was
going
to
see
the
black
car
burned
up
the
road
it
turned
to
the
right
off
the
white
highway
onto
the
curved
short
cut
and
there
was
the
field
and
there
was
the
wreck
of
the
transport
plane
still
where
it
had
crashed
and
burned
there
were
still
armed
guards
about
it
but
men
were
working
on
the
wreck
cutting
it
apart
with
torches
already
some
of
it
was
dissected
joe
went
to
the
remains
of
the
four
crates
the
largest
was
bent
askew
by
the
force
of
the
crash
or
an
explosion
joe
did
know
which
the
smallest
was
a
twisted
mass
of
charcoal
joe
gulped
and
dug
into
them
with
borrowed
tools
the
pilot
gyros
of
the
space
platform
would
apply
the
torque
that
would
make
the
main
gyros
shift
it
to
any
desired
position
or
else
hold
it
absolutely
still
they
were
to
act
in
a
sense
as
a
sort
of
steering
engine
on
the
and
keep
a
useful
function
out
in
space
if
a
star
photograph
was
to
be
made
it
was
essential
that
the
platform
hold
absolutely
still
while
the
exposure
lasted
if
a
guided
missile
was
to
be
launched
it
must
be
started
right
and
the
pilot
gyros
were
needed
to
turn
to
receive
an
arriving
rocket
from
earth
the
pilot
gyros
were
the
steering
apparatus
of
the
space
platform
they
had
to
be
more
than
adequate
they
had
to
be
perfect
on
the
alone
they
were
starkly
necessary
the
platform
could
hope
to
reach
its
orbit
without
them
joe
chipped
away
charred
planks
he
pulled
off
timbers
he
peeled
off
carbonized
wrappings
but
some
did
not
need
to
be
peeled
they
crumbled
at
a
touch
and
in
twenty
minutes
he
knew
the
whole
story
the
rotor
motors
were
ruined
the
couplers
connections
had
been
heated
red
hot
and
were
no
longer
hardened
steel
their
dimensions
had
changed
and
they
would
no
longer
fit
but
these
were
not
disastrous
items
they
were
serious
but
not
tragic
the
tragedy
was
the
gyros
themselves
on
their
absolute
precision
and
utterly
perfect
balance
the
whole
working
of
the
platform
would
depend
and
the
rotors
were
gashed
in
one
place
and
the
shafts
were
bent
being
bent
and
nicked
the
precision
of
the
apparatus
was
destroyed
its
precision
lost
the
whole
device
was
useless
and
it
had
taken
four
months
work
merely
to
get
it
perfectly
balanced
it
had
been
the
most
accurate
piece
of
machine
work
ever
done
on
earth
it
was
balanced
to
a
microgram
to
a
millionth
of
the
combined
weight
of
three
aspirin
tablets
it
would
revolve
at
revolutions
per
minute
it
had
to
balance
perfectly
or
it
would
vibrate
intolerably
if
it
vibrated
at
all
it
would
shake
itself
to
pieces
or
failing
that
send
aging
sound
waves
through
all
the
platform
substance
if
it
vibrated
by
the
least
fraction
of
a
of
an
inch
it
would
wear
and
vibrate
more
strongly
and
destroy
itself
and
possibly
the
platform
it
needed
the
precision
of
an
astronomical
lenses
multiplied
and
it
was
bent
it
was
exactly
as
useless
as
if
it
had
never
been
made
at
all
joe
felt
as
a
man
might
feel
if
the
mirror
of
the
greatest
telescope
on
earth
in
his
care
had
been
smashed
as
if
the
most
priceless
picture
in
the
world
in
his
charge
had
been
burned
but
he
felt
worse
whether
it
was
his
fault
or
not
and
it
was
it
was
destroyed
a
truck
rolled
up
and
was
stopped
by
a
guard
there
was
talk
and
the
guard
let
it
through
a
small
crane
lift
came
over
from
the
hangars
its
normal
use
was
the
lifting
of
plane
motors
in
and
out
of
their
nacelles
now
it
was
to
pick
up
the
useless
pieces
of
equipment
on
which
the
best
workmen
and
the
best
brains
of
the
kenmore
precision
tool
company
had
worked
unceasingly
for
eight
calendar
months
and
which
now
was
junk
joe
watched
numbed
by
disaster
while
the
crane
hook
went
down
to
position
above
the
objects
men
shored
up
the
heavy
things
and
ran
planks
under
them
and
then
deftly
fitted
rope
slings
for
them
to
be
lifted
by
it
was
late
afternoon
by
now
long
shadows
were
slanting
as
the
crane
truck
gears
whined
and
the
slack
took
up
and
the
first
of
the
four
charred
objects
lifted
and
swung
spinning
slowly
to
the
truck
that
had
come
from
the
shed
joe
froze
watching
he
watched
the
second
the
third
did
not
spin
it
merely
swayed
but
the
fourth
the
lines
up
to
the
crane
hook
were
twisted
as
the
largest
of
the
four
crates
lifted
from
its
bed
it
twisted
the
lines
toward
straightness
it
spun
it
spun
more
and
more
rapidly
and
then
more
and
more
slowly
and
stopped
and
began
to
spin
back
then
joe
caught
his
breath
it
seemed
that
he
had
breathed
in
minutes
the
big
crate
was
balanced
it
was
spinning
it
vibrating
it
spun
around
its
own
center
of
gravity
unerringly
revealed
by
its
flexible
suspension
he
watched
until
it
was
dropped
into
the
truck
then
he
went
stiffly
over
to
the
driver
of
the
car
that
had
brought
him
everything
all
right
he
said
feeling
a
queer
astonishment
at
his
own
words
i
going
to
ride
back
to
the
shed
with
the
stuff
i
brought
it
not
hurt
too
much
i
be
able
to
fix
it
with
a
man
or
two
i
can
pick
up
out
here
but
i
do
want
anything
else
to
happen
to
it
so
he
rode
back
out
to
the
shed
on
the
tailboard
of
the
truck
that
carried
the
crates
the
sun
set
as
he
rode
he
was
smudged
and
disheveled
the
reek
of
charred
wood
and
burnt
insulation
and
scorched
wrappings
was
strong
in
his
nostrils
but
he
felt
very
much
inclined
to
sing
it
occurred
to
joe
that
he
should
have
sent
sally
a
message
that
she
did
need
to
cry
as
a
substitute
for
him
he
felt
swell
he
knew
how
to
do
the
job
that
would
let
the
space
platform
take
off
he
tell
her
first
chance
it
was
very
good
to
be
alive
there
was
nobody
in
the
world
to
whom
the
space
platform
was
meaningless
to
joe
and
a
great
many
people
like
him
it
was
a
dream
long
and
stubbornly
held
to
and
now
doggedly
being
made
a
reality
to
some
it
was
the
prospect
of
peace
and
the
hope
of
a
quiet
life
children
and
grandchildren
and
a
serene
look
forward
to
the
future
some
people
prayed
yearningly
for
its
success
though
they
could
have
no
other
share
in
its
making
and
of
course
there
were
those
men
who
had
gotten
into
power
and
could
not
stay
there
without
ruthlessness
they
knew
what
the
platform
would
mean
to
their
kind
for
once
world
peace
was
certain
they
would
be
killed
by
the
people
they
ruled
over
so
they
sent
grubby
desperate
men
to
wreck
it
at
any
cost
they
were
prepared
to
pay
for
or
to
commit
any
crime
if
the
space
platform
could
be
smashed
and
turmoil
kept
as
the
norm
of
life
on
earth
and
there
were
the
people
who
were
actually
doing
the
building
joe
rode
a
bus
into
bootstrap
that
night
with
some
of
them
the
middle
shift
two
to
ten
was
off
fleets
of
busses
rolled
out
from
the
small
town
twenty
miles
away
their
headlights
making
a
procession
of
paired
flames
in
the
darkness
they
rolled
into
the
unloading
area
and
disgorged
the
late
shift
ten
to
six
to
be
processed
by
security
and
admitted
to
the
shed
then
quite
empty
the
busses
went
trundling
around
to
where
joe
waited
with
the
released
shift
milling
around
him
the
busses
stopped
and
opened
their
doors
the
waiting
men
stormed
in
shoving
zestfully
calling
to
each
other
scrambling
for
seats
or
merely
letting
themselves
be
pushed
on
board
the
bus
joe
found
himself
on
was
jammed
in
seconds
he
held
on
to
a
strap
and
did
notice
he
was
absorbed
in
the
rapt
contemplation
of
his
idea
for
the
repair
of
the
pilot
gyros
the
motors
could
be
replaced
easily
enough
the
foundation
of
his
first
despair
had
been
the
belief
that
everything
could
be
managed
but
one
thing
that
the
absolute
accuracy
was
the
only
thing
that
could
be
achieved
getting
that
accuracy
back
at
the
plant
had
consumed
four
months
of
time
each
of
the
gyros
was
four
feet
in
diameter
and
weighed
five
hundred
pounds
each
spun
at
it
had
to
be
machined
from
a
special
steel
to
assure
that
it
would
not
fly
to
pieces
from
sheer
centrifugal
force
each
was
plated
with
iridium
lest
a
speck
of
rust
form
and
throw
it
off
balance
if
the
shaft
and
bearings
were
not
centered
exactly
at
the
center
of
gravity
of
the
rotors
five
hundred
pounds
of
steel
off
balance
at
could
raise
the
devil
they
could
literally
wreck
the
platform
itself
and
exactly
at
the
center
of
gravity
meant
exactly
there
could
be
no
error
by
which
the
shaft
was
off
center
by
the
thousandth
of
an
inch
or
a
or
even
the
tenth
of
a
the
accuracy
had
to
be
absolute
gloating
over
the
solution
he
found
joe
could
have
hugged
himself
hanging
to
a
strap
in
the
waiting
bus
he
saw
another
bus
start
off
with
a
grinding
of
gears
and
a
spouting
of
exhaust
smoke
it
trundled
to
the
highway
and
rolled
away
another
and
another
followed
it
joe
bus
fell
in
line
they
headed
for
bootstrap
in
a
convoy
a
long
long
string
of
lighted
vehicles
running
one
behind
the
other
it
was
dark
outside
the
shed
was
alone
for
security
it
was
twenty
miles
from
the
town
where
its
work
force
slept
and
ate
and
made
merry
that
was
security
too
one
shift
came
off
and
went
through
a
security
check
and
during
that
time
the
shed
was
empty
save
for
the
security
officers
who
roamed
it
endlessly
looking
for
trouble
sometimes
they
found
it
the
shift
coming
on
also
passed
through
a
security
check
nobody
could
get
into
the
shed
without
being
identified
past
question
the
stage
was
long
since
passed
on
the
space
platform
job
security
was
tight
the
long
procession
of
busses
rolled
through
the
night
outside
was
dark
desert
overhead
were
many
stars
inside
the
jammed
bus
were
swaying
figures
crowded
in
the
aisle
and
every
seat
was
filled
there
was
the
smell
of
sweat
and
oil
and
tobacco
somebody
still
had
garlic
on
his
breath
from
lunch
there
was
the
noise
of
many
voices
there
was
an
argument
two
seats
up
the
aisle
there
was
the
rumble
of
the
motor
and
the
peculiar
whine
of
spinning
tires
men
had
to
raise
their
voices
to
be
heard
above
the
din
a
swaying
among
the
crowded
figures
more
pronounced
than
that
caused
by
the
motion
of
the
bus
caught
joe
eye
somebody
was
crowding
his
way
from
the
back
toward
the
front
the
aisle
was
narrow
joe
clung
to
his
strap
thinking
hard
and
happily
about
the
rebalancing
of
the
gyros
there
could
be
no
tolerance
it
had
to
be
exact
there
had
to
be
no
vibration
at
all
figures
swayed
away
from
him
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
hiya
he
swung
around
it
was
the
lean
man
haney
whom
he
kept
from
being
knocked
off
the
level
place
two
hundred
feet
up
joe
said
hello
i
thought
you
were
big
brass
said
haney
rumbling
in
his
ear
but
big
brass
do
ride
the
busses
i
going
in
to
try
to
hunt
up
the
chief
said
joe
haney
grunted
he
looked
estimatingly
at
joe
his
glance
fell
to
hands
joe
had
been
digging
further
into
the
crates
and
afterward
washed
up
but
packing
grease
is
hard
to
get
off
when
mixed
with
soot
and
charcoal
it
leaves
signs
haney
relaxed
we
mostly
eat
together
he
observed
satisfied
that
joe
was
regular
because
his
hands
were
soft
and
because
mechanic
soap
had
done
an
incomplete
job
on
them
the
chief
a
good
guy
join
us
sure
said
joe
and
thanks
a
brittle
voice
sounded
somewhere
around
haney
knees
joe
looked
down
startled
the
midget
he
seen
up
on
the
platform
nodded
up
at
him
squirmed
through
the
press
in
haney
wake
he
seemed
to
bristle
a
little
out
of
pure
habit
joe
made
room
for
him
i
okay
said
the
midget
pugnaciously
haney
made
a
formal
introduction
mike
scandia
he
thumbed
at
joe
joe
kenmore
he
eating
with
us
wants
to
find
the
chief
there
had
been
no
reference
to
the
risk
joe
had
run
in
keeping
haney
from
a
fall
but
now
haney
said
approvingly
i
wanted
to
say
thanks
anyhow
for
keeping
your
mouth
shut
new
here
joe
nodded
the
noise
in
the
bus
made
any
sort
of
talk
difficult
haney
appeared
used
to
it
saw
you
with
uh
major
holt
daughter
he
observed
again
why
i
thought
you
were
brass
figured
one
or
the
other
tell
on
braun
you
did
or
raised
cain
but
i
handle
it
braun
would
be
the
man
haney
had
been
fighting
if
haney
wanted
to
handle
it
his
way
it
was
naturally
none
of
joe
business
he
said
nothing
braun
a
good
guy
said
haney
crazy
that
all
he
picked
that
fight
picked
it
up
there
coulda
been
him
knocked
off
and
i
been
in
a
mess
i
see
him
tonight
the
midget
said
something
biting
in
his
peculiarly
cracked
and
brittle
voice
the
bus
rolled
and
rolled
and
rolled
it
was
a
long
twenty
miles
to
bootstrap
the
desert
outside
the
bus
windows
was
utterly
black
and
featureless
but
once
a
convoy
of
trucks
passed
going
to
the
shed
presently
though
lights
twinkled
in
the
night
again
the
bus
slowed
in
column
with
the
others
then
there
were
barrackslike
buildings
succeeding
each
other
and
then
there
was
a
corner
and
suddenly
the
outside
was
ablaze
with
light
the
busses
drew
up
to
the
curb
and
stopped
and
everybody
was
immediately
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
out
shoving
unnecessarily
and
joe
let
himself
be
carried
along
by
the
crowd
he
found
himself
on
the
sidewalk
with
bright
neon
signs
up
and
down
the
street
he
was
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
which
was
the
middle
shift
released
it
eddied
and
dispersed
without
seeming
to
lessen
most
of
the
figures
in
sight
were
men
there
were
very
very
few
women
the
neon
signs
proclaimed
that
here
one
could
buy
beer
and
that
this
was
place
and
that
was
sid
steak
joint
bowling
pool
a
store
still
open
for
this
shift
trade
sold
fancy
shirts
and
strictly
practical
work
clothes
and
highly
eccentric
items
of
personal
adornment
a
movie
house
a
second
a
third
somewhere
a
record
shop
fed
repetitious
music
to
the
night
air
there
was
movement
and
crowding
and
jostling
but
the
middle
of
the
street
was
almost
empty
save
for
the
busses
there
were
some
bicycles
but
practically
no
other
wheeled
traffic
after
all
bootstrap
was
strictly
a
security
town
a
man
could
leave
whenever
he
chose
but
there
were
formalities
and
personal
cars
were
practical
chief
be
yonder
said
haney
in
joe
ear
come
along
they
shouldered
their
way
along
the
sidewalk
the
were
of
a
type
construction
men
somebody
here
had
taken
part
in
the
building
of
every
skyscraper
and
bridge
and
dam
put
up
in
joe
lifetime
they
could
have
been
kept
away
from
the
space
platform
job
only
by
a
flat
refusal
by
security
to
let
them
be
hired
haney
and
joe
moved
toward
sid
steak
joint
with
mike
the
midget
marching
truculently
between
them
men
nodded
to
them
as
they
passed
joe
marshaled
in
his
mind
what
he
was
going
to
tell
the
chief
he
had
a
trick
for
fixing
the
pilot
gyros
a
speck
of
rust
would
spoil
them
and
they
had
been
through
a
plane
crash
and
a
fire
and
explosions
but
his
trick
would
do
in
ten
days
or
less
what
the
plant
back
home
had
needed
four
months
to
accomplish
the
trick
was
something
to
gloat
over
into
sid
steak
joint
a
juke
box
was
playing
over
in
a
booth
four
men
ate
hungrily
with
a
slot
tv
machine
in
the
wall
beside
them
showing
wrestling
matches
out
in
san
francisco
a
waiter
carried
a
huge
tray
from
which
steam
and
fragrant
odors
arose
there
was
the
chief
dark
and
saturnine
to
look
at
with
his
straight
black
hair
gleaming
in
the
light
he
was
a
mohawk
and
he
and
his
tribe
had
taken
to
steel
construction
work
a
long
time
back
they
were
good
there
were
not
many
big
construction
jobs
on
which
the
chief
tribesmen
were
not
to
be
found
working
forty
of
them
had
died
together
in
the
worst
construction
accident
in
history
when
a
bridge
on
its
way
to
completion
collapsed
in
the
making
but
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
at
work
on
the
space
platform
now
the
chief
had
essayed
work
at
the
kenmore
plant
and
he
been
good
he
pitched
on
the
plant
baseball
team
and
he
sung
bass
in
the
church
choir
but
there
had
been
nobody
else
around
who
talked
indian
and
he
gotten
lonely
at
that
though
he
left
because
the
space
platform
began
and
wild
horses
could
have
kept
him
away
from
a
job
like
that
he
held
a
table
for
haney
and
mike
but
his
eyes
widened
when
he
saw
joe
then
he
grinned
and
almost
upset
the
table
to
stand
up
and
greet
him
he
said
warmly
what
you
doin
here
right
now
said
joe
i
looking
for
you
i
got
a
job
for
you
the
chief
still
grinning
shook
his
head
not
me
i
here
till
the
platform
done
it
on
the
job
said
joe
i
got
to
get
a
crew
together
to
repair
something
i
brought
out
here
today
and
that
got
smashed
in
the
landing
the
four
of
them
sat
down
mike
chin
was
barely
above
the
table
top
the
chief
waved
to
a
waiter
steaks
all
around
he
bellowed
then
he
bent
toward
joe
shoot
it
joe
told
his
story
concisely
the
pilot
gyros
which
had
to
be
perfect
had
been
especially
gunned
at
by
saboteurs
an
attack
with
possibly
stolen
rockets
the
plane
was
and
somebody
at
an
airfield
had
had
a
chance
to
spring
the
trap
so
it
was
wreckage
crashed
and
burned
on
landing
the
chief
growled
haney
pressed
his
lips
together
the
eyes
of
mike
were
burning
plenty
of
that
sabotage
stuff
growled
the
chief
hard
to
catch
the
smash
the
gyros
and
the
have
to
wait
till
new
ones
got
made
and
that
more
time
for
more
sabotage
joe
said
carefully
i
think
it
can
be
licked
listen
a
minute
will
you
the
chief
fixed
his
eyes
upon
him
the
gyros
have
to
be
rebalanced
said
joe
they
have
to
spin
on
their
own
center
of
gravity
at
the
plant
they
set
them
up
spun
them
and
found
which
side
was
heavy
they
took
metal
off
till
it
ran
smoothly
at
five
hundred
then
they
spun
it
at
a
thousand
it
vibrated
they
found
imbalance
that
was
too
small
to
show
up
before
they
fixed
that
they
speeded
it
up
and
so
on
they
tried
to
make
the
center
of
gravity
the
center
of
the
shaft
by
trimming
off
the
weight
that
put
the
center
of
gravity
somewhere
else
right
the
chief
said
irritably
no
other
way
to
do
it
no
other
way
i
saw
one
said
joe
when
they
cleaned
up
the
wreck
at
the
airfield
they
heaved
up
the
crates
with
a
crane
the
slings
were
twisted
every
crate
spun
as
it
rose
but
not
one
wobbled
they
found
their
own
centers
of
gravity
and
spun
around
them
the
chief
scowled
deep
in
thought
then
his
face
went
blank
by
the
holy
mud
turtle
he
grunted
i
get
it
joe
said
with
very
great
pains
not
to
seem
triumphant
instead
of
spinning
the
shaft
and
trimming
the
rotor
we
spin
the
rotor
and
trim
the
shaft
we
form
the
shaft
around
the
center
of
gravity
instead
of
trying
to
move
the
center
of
gravity
to
the
middle
of
the
shaft
spin
the
rotors
on
a
flexible
bearing
base
i
think
it
work
surprisingly
it
was
mike
the
midget
who
said
warmly
you
got
it
yes
sir
you
got
it
the
chief
took
a
deep
breath
yeah
and
know
how
i
know
the
plant
built
a
centrifuge
once
remember
he
grinned
with
the
triumph
joe
concealed
it
was
just
a
plate
with
a
shaft
in
the
middle
there
were
vanes
on
the
plate
it
fitted
in
a
shaft
hole
that
was
much
too
big
they
blew
compressed
air
up
the
shaft
hole
it
floated
the
plate
up
the
air
hit
the
vanes
and
spun
the
plate
and
it
ran
as
sweet
as
honey
balanced
itself
and
did
wobble
a
bit
we
do
something
like
that
sure
will
you
work
on
it
with
me
asked
joe
we
need
a
sort
of
crew
three
or
four
altogether
have
to
figure
out
the
stuff
we
need
i
can
ask
for
anybody
i
want
i
asking
for
you
you
pick
the
others
the
chief
grinned
broadly
any
objections
haney
you
and
mike
and
me
and
joe
here
look
he
pulled
a
pencil
out
of
his
pocket
he
started
to
draw
on
the
plastic
table
top
and
then
took
a
paper
napkin
instead
something
like
this
the
steaks
came
sizzling
on
the
platters
they
been
cooked
in
the
outside
was
seared
and
the
inside
was
hot
and
deliciously
rare
intellectual
exercises
like
the
designing
of
a
operation
could
not
compete
with
such
aromas
and
sights
and
sounds
the
four
of
them
fell
to
but
they
talked
as
they
ate
absorbed
and
often
with
their
mouths
full
frequently
with
imperfect
articulation
but
with
deepening
satisfaction
as
the
steaks
vanished
and
the
method
they
use
took
form
in
their
minds
it
would
be
wholly
simple
of
course
when
the
rotors
were
spinning
about
their
centers
of
gravity
trimming
off
the
shaft
would
change
the
center
of
gravity
but
the
change
would
be
infinitely
less
than
trimming
off
the
rotors
rims
if
they
spun
the
rotors
and
used
an
abrasive
on
the
high
side
of
the
shaft
as
it
turned
going
to
have
precession
warned
mike
have
to
have
a
polishing
surface
quarter
turn
behind
the
cutter
that
hold
it
joe
only
remembered
afterward
to
be
astonished
that
mike
would
know
gyro
theory
at
the
moment
he
merely
swallowed
quickly
to
get
the
words
out
right
and
if
we
cut
too
far
down
we
can
plate
the
bearing
up
to
thickness
and
cut
it
down
again
plate
it
up
with
iridium
said
the
chief
he
waved
a
steak
knife
man
this
is
gon
na
be
fun
no
tolerance
you
say
joe
no
tolerance
agreed
joe
accurate
within
the
limits
of
measurement
the
chief
beamed
the
platform
was
a
challenge
to
all
of
humanity
the
pilot
gyro
was
essential
to
the
functioning
of
the
platform
to
provide
that
necessity
against
impossible
obstacles
was
a
challenge
to
the
four
who
were
undertaking
it
some
fun
repeated
the
chief
blissfully
they
ate
their
steaks
talking
they
consumed
huge
slabs
of
apple
pie
with
preposterous
mounds
of
ice
cream
on
top
still
talking
urgently
they
drank
coffee
interrupting
each
other
to
draw
diagrams
they
used
up
all
the
paper
napkins
and
were
still
at
it
when
someone
came
heavily
toward
the
table
it
was
the
stocky
man
who
had
fought
with
haney
on
the
platform
that
day
braun
he
tapped
haney
on
the
shoulder
the
four
at
the
table
looked
up
we
hadda
fight
today
said
braun
in
a
queer
voice
he
was
oddly
pale
we
did
finish
you
wan
na
finish
haney
growled
that
was
a
fool
business
he
said
angrily
that
ai
any
place
to
fight
up
on
the
job
you
know
it
yeah
said
braun
in
the
same
odd
voice
you
wan
na
finish
it
now
haney
said
formidably
i
not
dodgin
any
fight
i
did
dodge
it
then
i
not
dodgin
it
now
you
picked
it
it
was
crazy
but
if
you
got
over
the
craziness
braun
smiled
a
remarkably
peculiar
smile
i
still
crazy
we
finish
huh
haney
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
grimly
okay
we
finish
it
you
coulda
killed
me
i
coulda
killed
you
too
with
that
fall
ready
for
either
of
us
sure
too
bad
nobody
got
killed
said
braun
you
fellas
wait
said
haney
angrily
to
joe
and
the
rest
there
a
storeroom
out
back
sid
let
us
use
it
but
the
chief
pushed
back
his
chair
he
said
shaking
his
head
we
watchin
this
haney
spoke
with
elaborate
courtesy
you
mind
braun
want
to
get
some
friends
of
yours
too
i
got
no
friends
said
braun
let
go
the
chief
went
authoritatively
to
the
owner
of
sid
steak
joint
he
paid
the
bill
talking
the
owner
of
the
place
negligently
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
rear
this
was
not
an
unparalleled
request
for
the
use
of
a
storeroom
so
that
two
men
could
batter
each
other
undisturbed
bootstrap
was
a
town
because
to
get
fired
from
work
on
the
platform
was
to
lose
a
place
in
the
most
important
job
in
history
so
it
was
inevitable
that
the
settlement
of
quarrels
in
private
should
become
commonplace
the
chief
leading
they
filed
through
the
kitchen
and
out
of
doors
the
storeroom
lay
beyond
the
chief
went
in
and
switched
on
the
light
he
looked
about
and
was
satisfied
it
was
almost
empty
save
for
stacked
cartons
in
one
corner
braun
was
already
taking
off
his
coat
you
want
rounds
and
stuff
demanded
the
chief
i
want
fight
said
braun
thickly
okay
then
snapped
the
chief
no
kickin
or
gougin
a
man
down
he
has
a
chance
to
get
up
that
all
the
rules
right
haney
stripping
off
his
coat
in
turn
grunted
an
assent
he
handed
his
coat
to
joe
he
faced
his
antagonist
it
was
a
curious
atmosphere
for
a
fight
there
were
merely
the
plank
walls
of
the
storeroom
with
a
single
dangling
light
in
the
middle
and
an
unswept
floor
beneath
the
chief
stood
in
the
doorway
scowling
this
did
feel
right
there
was
not
enough
hatred
in
evidence
to
justify
it
there
was
doggedness
and
resolution
enough
but
braun
was
deathly
white
and
if
his
face
was
contorted
and
it
was
it
was
not
with
the
lust
to
batter
and
injure
and
maim
it
was
something
else
the
two
men
faced
each
other
and
then
the
stocky
swarthy
braun
swung
at
haney
the
blow
had
sting
in
it
but
nothing
more
it
almost
looked
as
if
braun
were
trying
to
work
himself
up
to
the
fight
he
insisted
on
finishing
haney
countered
with
a
roundhouse
blow
that
glanced
off
braun
cheek
and
then
they
bore
in
at
each
other
slugging
without
science
or
skill
joe
watched
braun
launched
a
blow
that
hurt
but
haney
sent
him
reeling
back
he
came
in
doggedly
again
and
swung
and
swung
but
he
had
no
idea
of
boxing
his
only
idea
was
to
slug
he
did
slug
haney
had
been
peevish
rather
than
angry
now
he
began
to
glower
he
began
to
take
the
fight
to
braun
he
knocked
braun
down
braun
staggered
up
and
rushed
a
wildly
flailing
fist
landed
on
haney
ear
he
doubled
braun
up
with
a
wallop
to
the
midsection
braun
came
back
fists
swinging
haney
closed
one
eye
for
him
he
came
back
haney
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
with
a
chest
blow
he
came
back
haney
split
his
lip
and
loosened
a
tooth
he
came
back
the
chief
said
sourly
this
ai
a
fight
quit
it
haney
he
know
how
haney
tried
to
draw
away
but
braun
swarmed
on
him
striking
fiercely
until
haney
had
to
floor
him
again
he
dragged
himself
up
and
rushed
at
haney
and
was
knocked
down
again
haney
stood
over
him
panting
furiously
quit
it
what
the
matter
with
you
braun
started
to
get
up
again
the
chief
interfered
and
held
him
while
haney
glared
he
ai
going
to
fight
any
more
braun
pronounced
the
chief
firmly
you
ai
got
a
chance
this
fight
over
you
had
enough
braun
was
bloody
and
horribly
battered
but
he
panted
he
got
enough
are
you
out
o
your
head
demanded
the
chief
he
ai
got
a
mark
on
him
i
ai
got
enough
panted
braun
till
he
got
enough
his
breath
was
coming
in
soblike
gasps
the
result
of
body
blows
it
had
been
a
fight
but
a
beating
administered
by
haney
but
braun
struggled
to
get
up
mike
the
midget
said
brittlely
you
got
enough
haney
satisfied
tell
him
so
sure
i
satisfied
snorted
haney
i
do
want
to
hit
him
any
more
i
got
enough
of
that
braun
panted
okay
okay
the
chief
let
him
get
to
his
feet
he
went
groggily
to
his
coat
he
tried
to
put
himself
into
it
mike
caught
joe
eye
and
nodded
meaningfully
joe
helped
braun
into
the
coat
there
was
silence
save
for
braun
heavy
labored
breathing
he
moved
unsteadily
toward
the
door
then
he
stopped
haney
he
said
effortfully
i
do
say
i
sorry
for
fighting
you
today
i
fight
first
but
now
i
say
i
am
sorry
you
are
good
guy
haney
i
was
crazy
i
got
reason
he
stumbled
out
of
the
door
and
was
gone
the
four
who
were
left
behind
stared
at
each
other
what
the
matter
with
him
demanded
haney
blankly
he
nuts
said
the
chief
if
he
was
gon
na
apologize
mike
shook
his
head
he
would
apologize
he
said
brittlely
because
he
thought
you
might
think
he
was
scared
but
when
he
proved
he
was
scared
of
a
beating
then
he
could
say
he
was
sorry
he
paused
i
seen
guys
i
liked
a
lot
less
than
him
haney
put
on
his
coat
frowning
i
do
get
it
he
rumbled
next
time
i
see
him
you
wo
snapped
mike
none
of
us
will
i
bet
on
it
but
he
was
wrong
the
others
went
out
of
the
storeroom
and
back
into
sid
steak
joint
and
the
chief
politely
thanked
the
proprietor
for
the
loan
of
his
storeroom
for
a
private
fight
then
they
went
out
into
the
business
street
of
bootstrap
what
do
we
do
now
asked
joe
where
you
sleeping
asked
the
chief
hospitably
i
can
get
you
a
room
at
my
place
i
staying
out
at
the
shed
joe
told
him
awkwardly
my
known
major
holt
a
long
time
i
staying
at
his
house
behind
the
shed
haney
raised
his
eyebrows
but
said
nothing
better
get
out
there
then
said
the
chief
it
midnight
and
they
might
want
to
lock
up
there
your
bus
a
lighted
bus
was
waiting
by
the
curb
its
doors
were
open
but
it
was
empty
of
passengers
single
busses
ran
out
to
the
shed
now
and
then
but
they
ran
in
fleets
at
time
joe
went
over
and
climbed
aboard
the
bus
we
turn
up
early
said
the
chief
this
wo
be
a
shift
job
look
things
over
and
lay
out
what
we
want
and
then
get
to
work
eh
right
said
joe
and
thanks
we
be
there
with
our
hair
in
braids
said
mike
in
his
cracked
voice
now
a
glass
of
beer
and
so
to
bed
haney
waved
his
hand
the
three
of
them
marched
off
the
two
huge
figures
of
haney
and
the
chief
with
mike
trotting
truculently
between
them
hardly
taller
than
their
knees
they
were
curiously
colorful
with
all
the
neon
signs
upon
them
they
turned
into
a
diner
joe
sat
in
the
bus
alone
the
driver
was
off
somewhere
the
sounds
of
bootstrap
were
distinctive
by
night
footsteps
and
the
jangling
of
bicycle
bells
and
voices
and
a
radio
blaring
somewhere
and
a
somewhere
else
and
a
sort
of
underriding
noise
of
festivity
there
was
a
sharp
rap
on
the
glass
by
joe
window
he
started
and
looked
out
braun
battered
and
bleeding
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
motioned
urgently
for
him
to
come
to
the
door
of
the
bus
joe
went
braun
stared
up
at
him
in
a
new
fashion
now
he
was
neither
dogged
nor
fierce
nor
desperate
to
look
at
despite
the
beating
he
taken
he
seemed
completely
and
somehow
frighteningly
tranquil
he
looked
like
somebody
who
has
come
to
the
end
of
torment
and
is
past
any
feeling
but
that
of
relief
from
suffering
you
said
braun
that
girl
you
were
with
today
her
pop
is
major
holt
eh
joe
frowned
and
reservedly
said
that
he
was
you
tell
her
pop
said
braun
detachedly
this
is
hot
tip
hot
tip
look
two
kilometers
north
of
shed
tomorrow
he
find
something
bad
hot
you
tell
him
two
kilometers
said
joe
his
frown
increasing
but
look
here
be
sure
say
hot
repeated
braun
rather
incredibly
he
smiled
then
he
turned
and
walked
quickly
away
joe
went
back
to
his
seat
in
the
empty
bus
and
sat
there
and
waited
for
it
to
start
and
tried
to
figure
out
what
the
message
meant
since
it
was
for
major
holt
it
had
something
to
do
with
security
and
security
meant
defense
against
sabotage
and
hot
might
mean
merely
or
in
these
days
it
might
mean
in
fact
it
might
mean
something
to
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
when
thought
of
in
connection
with
the
space
platform
joe
waited
for
the
bus
to
take
off
he
became
convinced
that
braun
use
of
the
word
hot
did
not
mean
merely
significant
the
other
meaning
was
what
he
had
in
mind
joe
teeth
tried
to
chatter
he
did
let
them
major
holt
was
to
be
found
when
joe
got
out
to
the
shed
and
he
was
in
the
house
in
the
area
behind
it
there
was
only
the
housekeeper
who
yawned
pointedly
as
she
let
joe
in
sally
was
presumably
long
since
asleep
and
joe
did
know
any
way
to
get
hold
of
the
major
he
assured
himself
that
braun
was
a
good
guy
if
he
he
would
have
insisted
on
taking
a
licking
before
he
apologized
and
he
had
said
there
was
any
hurry
tomorrow
he
said
so
joe
uneasily
let
himself
be
led
to
a
room
with
a
cot
and
he
was
asleep
in
what
seemed
seconds
but
just
the
same
he
was
badly
worried
in
fact
next
morning
joe
woke
at
a
practically
unearthly
hour
with
braun
message
pounding
on
his
brain
he
was
downstairs
waiting
when
the
housekeeper
appeared
she
looked
startled
major
holt
he
asked
but
the
major
was
gone
he
must
have
done
with
no
more
than
three
or
four
hours
sleep
there
was
an
empty
coffee
cup
whose
contents
gulped
down
before
going
back
to
the
security
office
joe
trudged
to
the
enclosure
around
the
area
and
explained
to
the
sentry
where
he
wanted
to
go
a
sleepy
driver
whisked
him
around
the
circle
to
the
security
building
and
he
found
his
way
to
major
holt
office
the
plain
and
gloomy
secretary
was
already
on
the
job
too
she
led
him
in
to
face
major
holt
he
blinked
at
the
sight
of
joe
hm
i
have
some
news
he
observed
we
the
parcel
that
exploded
when
it
was
dumped
from
the
plane
joe
had
almost
forgotten
it
too
many
other
things
had
happened
since
we
got
two
very
likely
prisoners
out
of
that
affair
said
the
major
they
may
talk
also
an
emergency
inspection
of
other
transport
planes
has
turned
up
three
other
grenades
tucked
away
in
wells
ah
bottles
have
turned
out
to
have
something
explosive
in
them
a
very
nice
bit
of
work
that
the
man
who
fueled
your
plane
ah
disappeared
that
is
bad
joe
said
politely
that
fine
sir
all
in
all
you
been
the
occasion
of
our
forestalling
a
good
deal
of
sabotage
said
the
major
bad
for
you
of
course
did
you
find
the
men
you
were
looking
for
i
found
them
but
i
have
them
transferred
to
work
under
your
direction
said
the
major
briskly
their
names
joe
gave
the
names
the
major
wrote
them
down
very
good
i
busy
now
i
a
tip
for
you
said
joe
i
think
it
should
be
checked
right
away
i
do
feel
too
good
about
it
the
major
waited
impatiently
and
joe
explained
very
carefully
about
the
fight
on
the
platform
the
day
before
braun
insistence
on
finishing
the
fight
in
bootstrap
and
then
the
tip
he
given
joe
after
everything
was
over
he
repeated
the
message
exactly
word
for
word
the
major
to
do
him
justice
did
not
interrupt
he
listened
with
an
expression
that
varied
between
grimness
and
weariness
when
joe
ended
he
picked
up
a
telephone
he
talked
briefly
joe
felt
a
reluctant
sort
of
approval
major
holt
was
not
a
man
one
could
ever
feel
very
close
to
and
the
work
he
was
in
charge
of
was
not
likely
to
make
him
popular
but
he
did
think
straight
and
fast
he
did
think
hot
meant
significant
either
when
he
hung
up
the
phone
he
said
curtly
when
will
your
work
crew
get
here
early
but
not
yet
said
joe
not
for
some
time
yet
go
with
the
pilot
said
the
major
you
recognize
what
braun
meant
as
soon
as
anybody
see
what
you
see
joe
stood
up
you
think
the
tip
is
straight
this
is
the
first
time
said
major
holt
detachedly
that
a
man
has
been
blackmailed
into
trying
sabotage
if
he
got
a
family
somewhere
abroad
and
they
threatened
with
death
or
torture
unless
he
does
here
he
in
a
bad
fix
it
happened
of
course
he
tell
me
he
watched
but
he
sometimes
finds
an
out
joe
was
puzzled
his
face
showed
it
he
can
try
to
do
the
sabotage
said
the
major
precisely
or
he
can
arrange
to
be
caught
trying
to
do
it
if
he
caught
he
tried
and
the
blackmail
threat
is
no
threat
at
all
so
long
as
he
keeps
his
mouth
shut
which
he
does
and
ah
you
would
be
surprised
how
often
a
man
who
was
born
in
the
united
states
would
rather
go
to
prison
for
sabotage
than
commit
it
here
joe
blinked
if
your
friend
braun
is
caught
said
the
major
he
will
be
punished
severely
officially
but
privately
someone
will
ah
mention
this
tip
and
say
and
he
be
told
that
he
will
be
released
from
prison
just
as
soon
as
he
thinks
it
safe
and
he
will
be
that
all
he
turned
to
his
papers
joe
went
out
on
the
way
to
meet
the
pilot
who
check
on
his
tip
he
thought
things
over
he
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
formless
but
very
definite
pride
he
was
quite
sure
what
he
was
proud
of
but
it
had
something
to
do
with
being
part
of
a
country
toward
which
men
of
wholly
different
upbringing
could
feel
deep
loyalty
if
a
man
who
was
threatened
unless
he
turned
traitor
a
man
who
might
not
even
be
a
citizen
arranged
to
be
caught
and
punished
for
an
apparent
crime
against
a
country
rather
than
commit
it
that
was
bad
there
can
be
a
lot
of
things
wrong
with
a
nation
but
if
somebody
from
another
one
entirely
can
come
to
feel
that
kind
of
loyalty
toward
it
well
not
too
bad
a
country
to
belong
to
joe
had
a
security
guard
with
him
this
time
instead
of
sally
as
he
went
across
the
vast
interior
of
the
shed
and
past
the
shimmering
growing
monster
that
was
the
platform
he
went
all
the
way
to
the
great
swinging
doors
that
let
in
materials
trucks
and
there
were
guards
there
and
they
checked
each
driver
very
carefully
before
they
admitted
his
truck
but
somehow
it
was
irritating
it
was
scornful
suspicion
there
be
snide
and
snappy
characters
in
the
security
force
of
course
swaggering
and
throwing
their
weight
about
but
even
they
were
guarding
something
that
men
some
men
were
willing
to
throw
away
their
lives
for
joe
and
his
guard
reached
one
of
the
huge
entrances
as
a
truck
came
in
with
a
load
of
shining
metal
plates
joe
escort
went
through
the
opening
with
him
and
they
waited
outside
the
sun
had
barely
risen
it
looked
huge
but
very
far
away
and
joe
suddenly
realized
why
just
this
spot
had
been
chosen
for
the
building
of
the
platform
the
ground
was
flat
all
the
way
to
the
eastern
horizon
there
even
a
minor
hillock
rising
above
the
plain
it
was
bare
arid
desert
it
was
featureless
save
for
sage
and
mesquite
and
tall
thin
stalks
of
yucca
but
it
was
flat
it
could
be
a
runway
it
was
a
perfect
place
for
the
platform
to
start
from
the
platform
touch
ground
at
all
after
it
was
out
of
the
shed
but
at
least
it
would
run
into
any
obstacles
on
its
way
toward
the
horizon
a
light
plane
came
careening
around
the
great
curved
outer
surface
of
the
shed
it
landed
and
taxied
up
to
the
door
it
swung
smartly
around
and
its
side
door
opened
a
bandaged
hand
waved
at
joe
he
climbed
in
the
pilot
of
this
light
flimsy
plane
was
the
of
the
transport
of
yesterday
he
was
the
man
joe
had
helped
to
dump
cargo
joe
climbed
in
and
settled
himself
the
small
motor
valiantly
the
plane
rushed
forward
over
desert
earth
and
went
swaying
up
into
the
air
the
pilot
now
shouted
cheerfully
above
the
din
hiya
you
could
sleep
either
burns
hurt
joe
shook
his
head
bothered
he
shouted
in
reply
then
he
added
do
i
do
something
to
help
or
am
i
along
just
for
the
ride
first
we
take
a
look
the
pilot
called
over
the
motor
racket
two
kilometers
due
north
of
the
shed
eh
that
right
we
see
what
there
the
pilot
told
him
the
small
plane
went
up
and
up
at
five
hundred
feet
nearly
level
with
the
roof
of
the
shed
it
swung
away
and
began
to
make
seemingly
erratic
dartings
out
over
the
spotty
desert
land
and
then
back
actually
it
was
a
search
pattern
joe
looked
down
from
his
side
of
the
small
cockpit
this
was
a
very
small
plane
indeed
and
in
consequence
its
motor
made
much
more
noise
inside
its
cabin
than
much
more
powerful
engines
in
bigger
ships
those
burns
i
got
shouted
the
pilot
staring
down
kept
me
awake
so
i
got
up
and
was
just
walking
around
when
the
call
came
for
somebody
to
drive
one
of
these
things
i
took
over
back
and
forth
and
back
and
forth
from
five
hundred
feet
in
the
early
morning
the
desert
had
a
curious
appearance
the
plane
was
low
enough
for
each
smallest
natural
feature
to
be
visible
and
it
was
early
enough
for
every
shrub
or
hummock
to
cast
a
long
slender
shadow
the
ground
looked
streaked
but
all
the
streaks
ran
the
same
way
and
all
were
shadows
joe
shouted
what
that
the
plane
banked
at
a
steep
angle
and
ran
back
it
banked
again
the
pilot
stared
carefully
he
reached
forward
and
pushed
a
button
there
was
a
tiny
impact
underfoot
another
steep
banking
turn
and
joe
saw
a
puff
of
smoke
in
the
air
the
pilot
shouted
it
a
man
he
looks
dead
he
swung
directly
over
the
small
prone
object
and
there
was
a
second
puff
of
smoke
they
got
range
finders
on
us
from
the
shed
he
called
across
the
space
separating
him
from
joe
this
marks
the
spot
now
see
if
there
anything
to
the
hot
part
of
that
tip
he
reached
over
behind
his
seat
and
brought
out
a
stubby
pole
like
a
fishpole
with
a
very
large
reel
there
was
also
a
headset
and
something
very
much
like
a
large
aluminum
fish
on
the
end
of
the
line
you
know
geiger
counters
called
the
pilot
stick
on
these
headphones
and
listen
joe
slipped
on
the
headset
the
pilot
threw
a
switch
and
joe
heard
clickings
they
had
no
pattern
and
no
fixed
frequency
they
were
clickings
at
strictly
random
intervals
but
there
was
an
average
frequency
at
that
let
the
counter
out
the
window
called
the
pilot
and
listen
tell
me
if
the
noise
goes
up
joe
obeyed
the
aluminum
fish
dangled
the
line
slanted
astern
from
the
wind
it
made
a
curve
between
the
pole
and
the
aluminum
plummet
which
was
hollow
in
the
direction
of
the
plane
motion
the
pilot
squinted
down
and
began
to
swing
in
a
wide
circle
around
the
spot
where
an
apparently
dead
man
had
been
sighted
and
above
which
puffs
of
smoke
now
floated
of
the
way
around
the
random
clickings
suddenly
became
a
roar
joe
said
hey
the
pilot
swung
the
plane
about
and
flew
back
he
pointed
to
the
button
he
pushed
poke
that
when
you
hear
it
again
the
clickings
they
roared
joe
pushed
the
button
he
felt
the
tiny
impact
once
more
said
the
pilot
he
swung
in
nearer
where
the
dead
man
lay
joe
had
a
sickening
idea
of
who
the
dead
man
might
be
a
sudden
rush
of
noise
in
the
headphones
and
he
pushed
the
button
again
reel
in
now
shouted
the
pilot
our
job
done
joe
reeled
in
as
the
plane
winged
steadily
back
toward
the
shed
there
were
puffs
of
smoke
floating
in
the
air
behind
they
had
been
ranged
on
at
the
instant
they
appeared
somebody
back
at
the
shed
knew
that
something
that
needed
to
be
investigated
was
at
a
certain
spot
and
the
two
later
puffs
of
smoke
had
said
that
radioactivity
was
notable
in
the
air
along
the
line
the
two
puffs
made
not
much
more
information
would
be
needed
the
meaning
of
braun
warning
that
his
tip
was
hot
was
definite
it
was
hot
in
the
sense
that
it
dealt
with
radioactivity
the
plane
dipped
down
and
landed
by
the
great
doors
again
it
taxied
up
and
the
pilot
killed
the
motor
we
been
using
geigers
for
months
he
said
pleasedly
and
never
got
a
sign
before
this
is
one
time
we
were
set
for
something
what
asked
joe
but
he
knew
atomic
dust
is
one
good
guess
the
pilot
told
him
it
was
talked
of
as
a
possible
weapon
away
back
in
the
smyth
report
nobody
ever
tried
it
we
thought
it
might
be
tried
against
the
platform
if
somebody
managed
to
spread
some
really
hot
radioactive
dust
around
the
shed
all
three
shifts
might
get
fatally
burned
before
it
was
noticed
think
so
anyhow
but
the
guy
who
was
supposed
to
dump
it
opened
up
the
can
for
a
look
and
it
killed
him
he
climbed
out
of
the
plane
and
went
to
the
doorway
he
took
a
telephone
from
a
guard
and
talked
crisply
into
it
he
hung
up
somebody
coming
for
you
he
said
amiably
wait
here
be
seeing
you
he
went
out
the
motor
kicked
over
and
caught
and
the
tiny
plane
raced
away
seconds
later
it
was
aloft
and
winging
southward
joe
waited
presently
a
door
opened
and
something
came
clanking
out
it
was
a
tractor
with
surprisingly
heavy
armor
there
were
men
in
it
also
wearing
armor
of
a
peculiar
sort
which
they
were
still
adjusting
the
tractor
towed
a
platform
on
which
there
were
a
crane
and
a
very
considerable
bin
with
a
top
it
went
briskly
off
into
the
distance
toward
the
north
joe
was
amazed
but
comprehending
the
vehicle
and
the
men
were
armored
against
radioactivity
they
would
approach
the
dead
man
from
upwind
and
they
would
scoop
up
his
body
and
put
it
in
the
bin
and
with
it
all
deadly
radioactive
material
near
him
this
was
the
equipment
that
must
have
been
used
to
handle
the
dud
atom
bomb
some
months
back
it
had
been
ready
for
that
it
was
ready
for
this
emergency
somebody
had
tried
to
think
of
every
imaginable
situation
that
could
arise
in
connection
with
the
platform
but
in
a
moment
a
guard
came
for
joe
and
took
him
to
where
the
chief
and
haney
and
mike
waited
by
the
still
crates
they
had
some
new
ideas
about
the
job
on
hand
that
were
better
than
the
original
ones
in
some
details
all
four
of
them
set
to
work
to
make
a
careful
survey
of
damage
of
parts
that
would
have
to
be
replaced
and
of
those
that
needed
to
be
repaired
the
discoveries
they
made
would
have
appalled
joe
earlier
now
he
merely
made
notes
of
parts
necessary
to
be
replaced
by
new
ones
that
could
be
had
within
the
repair
time
for
rebalancing
the
rotors
this
is
sure
a
mess
said
haney
mournfully
as
they
worked
it
two
days
just
getting
things
cleaned
up
the
chief
eyed
the
rotors
there
were
two
of
them
great
disks
with
extraordinary
short
and
stubby
shafts
that
were
brought
to
beautifully
polished
conical
ends
to
fit
in
the
bearings
the
bearings
were
hollowed
to
fit
the
shaft
ends
but
they
were
intricately
scored
to
form
oil
channels
in
operation
a
very
special
silicone
oil
would
be
pumped
into
the
bearings
under
high
pressure
distributed
by
the
channels
the
oil
would
form
a
film
that
by
its
pressure
would
hold
the
cone
end
of
the
bearing
away
from
actual
contact
with
the
metal
the
rotors
in
fact
would
be
floated
in
oil
just
as
the
centrifuge
the
chief
had
mentioned
had
floated
on
compressed
air
but
they
had
to
be
perfectly
balanced
because
any
imbalance
would
make
the
shaft
pierce
the
oil
film
and
touch
the
metal
of
the
bearing
and
when
a
shaft
is
turning
at
it
is
not
good
for
it
to
touch
anything
shaft
and
bearing
would
burn
in
fractions
of
a
second
and
there
would
be
several
devils
to
pay
we
got
to
spin
it
in
a
lathe
said
the
chief
profoundly
to
hold
the
chucks
the
chucks
have
got
to
be
these
same
bearings
because
nothing
else
will
stand
the
speed
and
we
got
to
cut
out
the
bed
plate
of
any
lathe
we
find
hm
we
got
to
do
our
spinning
with
the
shaft
lined
up
with
the
earth
axis
too
mike
nodded
wisely
and
joe
knew
he
pointed
that
out
it
was
true
enough
a
gyro
could
only
be
run
for
minutes
in
one
single
direction
if
its
mount
were
fixed
if
a
precisely
mounted
gyro
had
its
shaft
pointed
at
the
sun
for
example
while
it
ran
its
axis
would
try
to
follow
the
sun
it
would
try
not
to
turn
with
the
earth
and
it
would
wreck
itself
they
had
to
use
the
cone
bearings
but
in
order
to
protect
the
fine
channellings
for
oil
they
have
to
use
shims
at
the
beginning
while
running
at
low
speed
the
cone
ends
of
the
shaft
would
need
new
machining
to
line
them
up
the
bearings
had
to
be
fixed
yet
flexible
the
they
had
used
many
paper
napkins
the
night
before
merely
envisioning
these
details
new
problems
turned
up
as
the
apparatus
itself
was
being
uncovered
and
cleaned
they
worked
for
hours
clearing
away
soot
and
charred
material
list
of
small
parts
to
be
replaced
from
the
home
plant
was
as
long
as
his
arm
the
motors
of
course
had
to
be
scrapped
and
new
ones
substituted
considering
their
speed
the
field
strength
at
operating
rate
was
almost
imperceptible
they
had
to
be
built
new
which
would
mean
work
at
kenmore
a
messenger
came
for
joe
the
security
office
wanted
him
major
gloomy
secretary
did
not
even
glance
up
as
he
entered
major
holt
himself
looked
tired
there
was
a
man
out
there
he
said
curtly
i
think
it
is
your
friend
braun
i
get
you
to
look
and
identify
joe
had
suspected
as
much
he
waited
he
opened
a
container
of
cobalt
powder
it
was
in
a
beryllium
case
there
was
half
a
pound
of
it
it
killed
him
radioactive
cobalt
said
joe
definitely
said
the
major
grimly
half
a
pound
of
it
gives
off
the
radiation
of
an
eighth
of
a
ton
of
pure
radium
one
can
guess
that
he
had
been
instructed
to
get
up
as
high
as
he
could
in
the
shed
and
dump
the
powder
into
the
air
it
would
diffuse
scatter
as
it
sifted
down
it
would
have
contaminated
the
whole
shed
past
all
use
for
years
let
alone
killing
everybody
in
it
joe
swallowed
he
was
burned
then
he
had
the
equivalent
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
radium
within
inches
of
his
body
the
major
said
unbendingly
and
naturally
it
was
not
healthy
for
that
matter
the
container
itself
was
not
adequate
protection
for
him
once
he
carried
it
in
his
pocket
for
a
very
few
minutes
he
was
a
dead
man
even
though
he
was
not
conscious
of
the
fact
joe
knew
what
was
wanted
of
him
you
want
me
to
look
at
him
he
said
the
major
nodded
yes
afterward
get
a
radiation
check
on
yourself
it
is
hardly
likely
that
he
was
ah
carrying
the
stuff
with
him
last
night
in
bootstrap
but
if
he
was
ah
you
may
need
some
precautionary
treatment
you
and
the
men
who
were
with
you
joe
realized
what
that
meant
braun
had
been
given
a
relatively
small
container
of
the
deadliest
available
radioactive
material
on
earth
milligrams
of
it
shipped
from
oak
ridge
for
scientific
use
were
encased
in
thick
lead
chests
he
carried
two
hundred
and
fifty
grams
in
a
container
he
could
put
in
his
pocket
he
was
not
only
dead
as
he
walked
under
such
circumstances
he
was
also
death
to
those
who
walked
near
him
somebody
else
may
have
been
burned
in
any
case
said
the
major
detachedly
i
am
going
to
issue
a
radioactivity
alarm
and
check
every
man
in
bootstrap
for
burns
it
is
ah
very
likely
that
the
man
who
delivered
it
to
this
man
is
burned
too
but
you
will
not
mention
this
of
course
he
waved
his
hand
in
dismissal
joe
turned
to
go
the
major
added
grimly
by
the
way
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
of
planes
we
found
eight
so
far
ready
to
be
crashed
when
a
string
was
pulled
while
they
were
serviced
but
the
men
who
did
the
have
vanished
they
disappeared
suddenly
during
last
night
they
were
warned
have
you
talked
to
anybody
no
sir
said
joe
i
would
like
to
know
said
the
major
coldly
how
they
knew
we
found
out
their
trick
joe
went
out
he
felt
very
cold
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
was
to
identify
braun
then
he
was
to
get
a
radiation
check
on
himself
in
that
order
of
events
he
was
to
identify
braun
first
because
if
braun
had
carried
a
of
radioactive
cobalt
on
him
in
sid
steak
joint
the
night
before
joe
was
going
to
die
and
so
were
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
and
anybody
else
who
passed
near
him
so
joe
was
to
do
the
identification
before
he
was
disturbed
by
the
information
that
he
was
dead
he
made
the
identification
braun
was
very
decently
laid
out
in
a
box
with
a
window
over
his
face
there
was
no
sign
of
any
injury
on
him
except
from
his
fight
with
haney
the
radiation
burns
were
deep
but
they
left
no
marks
of
their
own
died
before
outer
symptoms
could
occur
joe
signed
the
identification
certificate
he
went
to
be
checked
for
his
own
chances
of
life
it
was
a
peculiar
sensation
the
most
peculiar
was
that
he
was
afraid
he
was
neither
confident
that
he
was
not
burned
inside
nor
sure
that
he
was
he
simply
was
not
afraid
nobody
really
ever
believes
that
he
is
going
to
die
in
the
sense
of
ceasing
to
exist
the
most
arrant
coward
stood
before
a
wall
to
be
shot
or
strapped
in
an
electric
chair
finds
that
astoundingly
he
does
not
believe
that
what
happens
to
his
body
is
going
to
kill
him
the
individual
that
is
why
a
great
many
people
die
with
reasonable
dignity
they
know
it
is
not
worth
making
too
much
of
a
fuss
over
but
when
the
geiger
counters
had
gone
over
him
from
head
to
foot
and
his
body
temperature
was
normal
and
his
reflexes
sound
when
he
was
assured
that
he
had
not
been
exposed
to
dangerous
radiation
joe
felt
distinctly
weak
in
the
knees
and
that
was
natural
too
he
went
trudging
back
to
the
wrecked
gyros
his
friends
were
gone
leaving
a
scrawled
memo
for
him
they
had
gone
to
pick
out
the
machine
tools
for
the
work
at
hand
he
continued
to
check
over
the
wreckage
thinking
with
a
detached
compassion
of
that
poor
devil
braun
who
was
the
victim
of
men
who
hated
the
idea
of
the
space
platform
and
what
it
would
mean
to
humanity
men
of
that
kind
thought
of
themselves
as
superior
to
humanity
and
of
human
beings
as
creatures
to
be
enslaved
so
they
arranged
for
planes
to
crash
and
burn
and
for
men
to
be
murdered
and
they
practiced
blackmail
or
rewarded
those
who
practiced
it
for
them
they
wanted
to
prevent
the
platform
from
existing
because
it
would
keep
them
from
trying
to
pull
the
world
down
in
ruins
so
they
could
rule
over
the
wreckage
joe
who
had
so
recently
thought
it
likely
that
he
would
die
considered
these
actions
with
an
icy
dislike
that
was
much
deeper
than
anger
it
was
backed
by
everything
he
believed
in
everything
he
had
ever
wanted
and
everything
he
hoped
for
and
anger
could
cool
off
but
the
way
he
felt
about
people
who
would
destroy
others
for
their
own
purposes
could
not
cool
off
it
was
part
of
him
he
thought
about
it
as
he
worked
with
all
the
noises
of
the
shed
singing
in
his
ears
a
voice
said
joe
he
started
and
turned
sally
stood
behind
him
looking
at
him
very
gravely
she
tried
to
smile
dad
told
me
she
said
about
the
that
says
you
all
right
may
i
congratulate
you
on
your
being
with
us
for
a
while
on
the
cobalt
not
getting
near
you
or
the
rest
of
us
joe
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
say
i
going
inside
the
platform
she
told
him
would
you
like
to
come
along
he
wiped
his
hands
on
a
piece
of
waste
naturally
my
gang
is
off
picking
out
tools
i
ca
do
much
until
they
come
back
he
fell
into
step
beside
her
they
walked
toward
the
platform
and
it
was
still
magic
no
matter
how
often
joe
looked
at
it
it
was
huge
beyond
belief
though
it
was
surely
not
heavy
in
proportion
to
its
size
its
bright
plating
shone
through
the
gossamer
scaffolding
all
about
it
there
was
always
a
faint
bluish
mist
in
the
air
and
there
were
the
lights
of
welding
torches
playing
here
and
there
the
sounds
of
the
shed
were
a
steady
small
tumult
in
joe
ears
he
was
getting
accustomed
to
them
though
how
is
it
you
can
go
around
so
freely
he
asked
abruptly
i
have
to
be
checked
and
rechecked
you
get
a
full
clearance
she
told
him
it
has
to
go
through
channels
me
i
have
influence
i
always
come
in
through
security
and
i
have
the
door
guards
trained
and
i
do
have
business
in
the
platform
he
turned
his
head
to
look
at
her
interior
decoration
she
explained
and
do
laugh
it
prettifying
it
psychology
the
platform
was
designed
by
engineers
and
physicists
and
people
with
slide
rules
they
made
a
beautiful
environment
for
machinery
but
there
will
be
men
living
in
it
and
they
are
machines
i
do
see
they
designed
the
hydroponic
garden
said
sally
with
a
certain
scorn
they
calculated
very
neatly
that
eleven
square
feet
of
leaf
surface
of
a
pumpkin
plant
will
purify
all
the
air
a
resting
man
uses
and
so
much
more
will
purify
the
air
a
man
uses
when
he
working
hard
so
they
designed
the
gardens
for
the
most
efficient
production
of
the
greatest
possible
leaf
surface
of
pumpkin
plants
they
figured
food
would
be
brought
up
by
the
tender
rockets
but
can
you
imagine
the
men
in
the
platform
floating
among
the
stars
living
on
dehydrated
food
and
stuffing
themselves
hungrily
with
pumpkins
because
that
is
the
only
fresh
food
they
have
joe
saw
the
irony
they
thinking
of
mechanical
efficiency
said
sally
indignantly
i
do
know
anything
about
machinery
but
i
wasted
an
awful
lot
of
time
at
school
and
otherwise
if
i
do
know
something
about
human
beings
i
argued
and
the
garden
now
is
as
mechanically
efficient
but
it
be
a
nice
place
for
a
man
to
go
into
he
wo
smell
pumpkin
plants
all
the
time
either
i
even
gotten
them
to
include
some
flowers
they
were
very
near
the
platform
and
it
was
very
near
to
completion
joe
looked
at
it
hungrily
and
he
felt
a
great
sense
of
urgency
he
tried
to
strip
away
the
scaffolding
in
his
mind
and
see
it
floating
proudly
free
in
emptiness
with
sunshine
glinting
from
it
and
only
a
background
of
unwinking
stars
sally
voice
went
on
and
i
really
put
up
an
argument
about
the
living
quarters
they
had
every
interior
wall
painted
aluminum
i
argued
that
in
space
or
out
of
it
where
people
have
to
live
housekeeping
this
is
going
to
be
their
home
and
they
ought
to
feel
human
in
it
they
passed
into
one
of
the
openings
in
the
maze
of
uprights
all
about
them
there
were
trucks
and
puffing
engines
and
hoists
joe
dragged
sally
aside
as
a
monstrous
came
from
where
it
had
delivered
some
gigantic
item
of
interior
use
it
rumbled
past
them
and
she
led
the
way
to
a
flight
of
temporary
wooden
stairs
with
two
security
guards
at
the
bottom
sally
talked
severely
to
them
and
they
grinned
and
waved
for
joe
to
go
ahead
he
went
up
the
steps
which
would
be
pulled
down
before
the
platform
launching
and
went
actually
inside
the
space
platform
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
moment
of
extreme
vividness
for
him
within
the
past
hour
come
to
think
detachedly
of
the
possibility
of
death
for
himself
and
then
had
learned
that
he
would
live
for
a
while
yet
he
knew
that
sally
had
been
scared
on
his
account
and
that
her
manner
was
partly
assumed
she
was
at
least
as
much
wrought
up
as
he
was
and
this
was
the
first
time
he
was
going
into
what
would
be
the
first
space
ship
ever
to
leave
the
earth
on
a
journey
nobody
could
have
gone
through
the
changes
of
emotion
joe
had
experienced
that
morning
and
remained
quite
seeing
a
dead
man
who
had
more
or
less
deliberately
killed
himself
so
that
he
would
have
to
kill
joe
for
one
had
its
effect
knowing
that
it
was
certainly
possible
the
man
had
killed
himself
in
time
had
another
being
checked
over
for
radiation
burns
which
would
mean
that
he
die
quite
comfortably
within
three
or
four
days
and
then
learning
that
no
burns
existed
was
something
of
an
ordeal
and
sally
of
course
her
feelings
should
have
been
as
vivid
as
his
own
but
the
fact
that
she
been
scared
for
him
held
some
significance
when
on
top
of
all
the
rest
he
went
into
the
space
platform
for
the
first
time
joe
was
definitely
keyed
up
but
he
talked
technology
he
examined
the
inner
skin
and
its
lining
before
going
beyond
the
temporary
entrance
the
plating
of
the
platform
was
actually
double
the
outer
layer
was
a
against
which
particles
of
cosmic
dust
would
strike
and
explode
without
damage
to
the
inner
skin
they
could
even
penetrate
it
without
causing
a
leak
of
air
inside
the
inner
skin
there
was
a
layer
of
glass
wool
for
heat
insulation
inside
the
glass
wool
was
a
layer
of
material
serving
exactly
the
function
of
the
coating
of
a
bulletproof
gasoline
tank
no
meteor
under
a
size
could
hope
to
make
a
puncture
even
at
the
speed
that
is
the
theoretical
maximum
for
meteors
and
if
one
did
the
selfsealing
stuff
would
stop
the
leak
immediately
joe
could
explain
the
protection
of
the
metal
skins
he
did
when
a
missile
travels
fast
enough
he
said
absorbedly
it
stops
acquiring
extra
puncturing
ability
over
a
mile
a
second
impact
be
transmitted
from
front
to
rear
the
back
end
of
the
thing
that
hits
has
arrived
at
the
hit
place
before
the
shock
of
arrival
can
travel
back
to
it
it
like
a
train
in
a
collision
which
does
stop
all
at
once
a
meteor
hitting
the
platform
will
telescope
on
itself
like
the
cars
of
a
railroad
train
that
hits
another
at
full
speed
sally
listened
enigmatically
so
said
joe
the
punching
effect
is
there
a
meteor
hitting
the
platform
wo
punch
it
explode
part
of
it
will
turn
to
vapor
metallic
vapor
if
it
metal
and
rocky
vapor
if
it
stone
it
blow
a
crater
in
the
metal
plate
it
blow
away
as
much
weight
of
the
skin
as
it
weighs
itself
mass
for
mass
so
that
weight
for
weight
pea
soup
would
be
just
as
effective
armor
against
meteors
as
hardened
steel
sally
said
dear
me
you
must
read
the
newspapers
the
odds
figure
out
the
odds
are
even
that
the
platform
wo
get
an
actual
meteor
puncture
in
the
first
twenty
thousand
years
it
floating
round
the
earth
twenty
thousand
two
seventy
joe
said
sally
she
was
trying
to
tease
him
but
her
face
showed
a
little
of
the
strain
i
read
the
magazine
articles
too
in
fact
i
sometimes
show
the
tame
article
writers
around
when
they
cleared
to
see
the
platform
joe
winced
a
little
then
he
grinned
wryly
that
cuts
me
down
to
size
eh
she
smiled
at
him
but
they
both
felt
queer
they
went
on
into
the
interior
of
the
huge
space
ship
lots
of
space
said
joe
this
could
been
smaller
it
be
empty
when
it
goes
up
said
sally
but
you
know
about
that
do
you
joe
did
know
the
reasons
for
the
streamlining
of
rockets
to
be
fired
from
the
ground
did
apply
to
the
platform
not
with
the
same
urgency
anyhow
rockets
had
to
burn
their
fuel
fast
to
get
up
out
of
the
dense
air
near
the
ground
they
had
to
be
streamlined
to
pierce
the
thick
resisting
part
of
the
atmosphere
the
platform
did
it
would
climb
by
itself
it
would
be
carried
necessarily
at
slow
speed
up
to
the
point
where
jet
motors
were
most
efficient
and
then
it
would
be
carried
higher
until
they
ceased
to
be
efficient
only
when
it
was
up
where
air
resistance
was
a
very
small
fraction
of
drag
would
its
own
rockets
fire
it
would
gain
much
by
being
shaped
to
cut
thin
air
and
it
would
lose
a
lot
for
one
thing
the
launching
process
planned
for
the
platform
allowed
it
to
be
built
complete
so
far
as
its
hull
was
concerned
once
it
got
out
into
its
orbit
there
would
be
no
more
worries
there
would
be
any
gamble
on
the
practicability
of
assembling
a
great
structure
in
a
weightless
world
the
two
of
them
and
the
way
they
both
felt
it
seemed
natural
for
joe
to
be
helping
sally
very
carefully
through
the
corridors
of
the
platform
the
two
of
them
came
to
the
engine
room
this
was
the
place
where
the
drive
of
the
platform
was
centered
it
was
where
the
service
motors
and
the
system
and
the
fluid
pumps
were
powered
off
the
engine
room
the
main
gyros
were
already
installed
they
waited
only
for
the
pilot
gyros
to
control
them
as
a
steering
engine
controls
an
earth
ship
rudder
joe
looked
very
thoughtfully
at
the
gyro
assembly
that
was
familiar
from
the
working
drawings
but
he
let
sally
guide
him
on
without
trying
to
stop
and
look
closely
she
showed
him
the
living
quarters
they
centered
in
a
great
open
space
sixty
feet
long
and
twenty
wide
and
high
there
were
bookshelves
and
two
balconies
and
chairs
private
cabins
opened
from
it
on
different
levels
but
there
were
no
steps
to
them
yet
there
were
comfortable
chairs
with
straps
so
that
when
a
man
was
weightless
he
could
fasten
himself
in
them
there
were
ash
trays
ingeniously
designed
to
look
like
exactly
that
and
nothing
else
but
ashes
would
not
fall
into
them
but
would
be
drawn
into
them
by
suction
there
was
unpatterned
carpet
on
the
floor
on
the
ceiling
it
going
to
feel
queer
said
sally
oddly
quiet
when
all
this
is
out
in
space
but
it
will
look
fairly
normal
i
think
that
important
this
room
will
look
like
a
big
private
library
more
than
anything
else
one
wo
be
reminded
every
second
by
everything
he
sees
that
living
in
a
strictly
synthetic
environment
he
wo
feel
cramped
if
all
the
rooms
were
small
a
man
would
feel
as
if
he
were
in
prison
at
least
this
way
he
can
pretend
that
things
are
normal
her
mind
was
not
wholly
on
her
words
she
been
frightened
for
joe
and
he
was
acutely
aware
of
it
because
he
felt
a
peculiar
himself
normal
he
said
drily
except
that
he
does
weigh
anything
i
worried
about
that
said
sally
sleeping
going
to
be
a
big
problem
it
take
getting
used
to
joe
agreed
there
was
a
momentary
pause
they
were
simply
looking
about
the
great
room
sally
stirred
uneasily
tell
me
what
you
think
she
said
you
been
in
an
elevator
that
started
to
drop
like
a
plummet
when
the
platform
is
orbiting
it
be
like
that
all
the
time
only
worse
no
weight
joe
if
you
were
in
an
elevator
that
seemed
to
be
dropping
and
dropping
and
dropping
for
hours
on
end
do
you
think
you
could
go
to
sleep
joe
had
thought
about
it
and
he
was
acutely
conscious
of
sally
just
then
but
the
idea
startled
him
it
might
be
hard
to
adjust
to
he
admitted
it
be
hard
to
adjust
to
awake
said
sally
but
getting
adjusted
to
it
asleep
should
be
worse
you
waked
up
from
a
dream
that
falling
sure
said
joe
then
he
whistled
i
see
you
drop
off
to
sleep
and
you
be
falling
so
you
wake
up
everybody
in
the
platform
will
be
falling
around
the
earth
in
the
platform
orbit
every
time
they
doze
off
they
be
falling
and
they
wake
up
he
managed
to
think
about
it
it
was
true
enough
a
man
awake
could
remind
himself
that
he
only
thought
and
felt
that
he
was
falling
and
that
there
was
no
danger
but
what
would
happen
when
he
tried
to
sleep
falling
is
the
first
fear
a
human
being
ever
knows
everybody
in
the
world
has
at
one
time
waked
up
gasping
from
a
dream
of
precipices
down
which
he
plunged
it
is
an
inborn
terror
and
no
matter
how
thoroughly
a
man
might
know
in
his
conscious
mind
that
weightlessness
was
normal
in
emptiness
his
conscious
mind
would
go
off
duty
when
he
went
to
sleep
a
completely
primitive
subconscious
would
take
over
then
and
it
would
not
be
satisfied
it
might
wake
him
frantically
at
any
sign
of
dozing
until
he
cracked
up
from
sheer
insomnia
or
else
let
him
sleep
only
when
exhaustion
produced
unconsciousness
rather
than
restful
slumber
that
a
tough
one
he
said
disturbedly
and
noticed
that
she
still
showed
signs
of
her
recent
distress
there
not
much
to
be
done
about
it
either
i
suggested
something
said
sally
and
they
built
it
in
i
hope
it
works
she
explained
uncomfortably
it
a
sort
of
blanket
with
a
top
that
straps
down
and
an
inflatable
underside
when
a
man
wants
to
sleep
he
inflate
this
thing
and
it
will
hold
him
in
his
bunk
it
wo
touch
his
head
of
course
and
he
can
move
but
it
will
press
against
him
gently
joe
thought
over
what
sally
had
just
explained
he
noticed
that
they
were
quite
close
together
but
he
put
his
mind
on
her
words
it
be
like
a
man
swimming
he
asked
one
can
go
to
sleep
floating
there
no
sensation
of
weight
but
there
the
feeling
of
pressure
all
about
a
man
might
be
able
to
sleep
if
he
felt
he
were
floating
yes
that
a
good
idea
sally
it
work
a
man
will
think
he
floating
rather
than
falling
sally
flushed
a
little
i
thought
of
it
another
way
she
said
awkwardly
when
we
go
to
sleep
we
go
way
back
we
like
babies
with
all
a
baby
fears
and
needs
it
feel
like
floating
but
i
tried
one
of
those
bunks
it
feels
like
it
feels
sort
of
dreamy
as
if
someone
were
holding
one
quite
safe
it
feels
as
if
one
were
a
baby
and
beautifully
secure
but
of
course
i
have
tried
it
weightless
i
just
hope
it
works
as
if
embarrassed
she
turned
abruptly
and
showed
him
the
kitchen
every
pan
was
covered
the
top
of
the
stove
was
strips
arranged
rather
like
the
top
of
a
magnetic
chuck
pans
would
cling
to
it
and
the
covers
had
a
curious
flexible
lining
which
joe
could
not
understand
it
a
flexible
plastic
that
heatproof
said
sally
it
inflates
and
holds
the
food
down
to
the
hot
bottom
of
the
pan
they
expected
the
crew
to
eat
food
i
said
that
it
would
be
bad
enough
to
have
to
drink
out
of
plastic
bottles
instead
of
glasses
they
hung
one
of
these
stoves
upside
down
for
me
and
i
cooked
bacon
and
eggs
and
pancakes
with
the
cover
of
the
pan
pointing
to
the
floor
they
said
the
psychological
effect
would
be
worth
while
joe
was
stirred
he
followed
her
out
of
the
kitchen
and
said
warmly
the
more
warmly
because
these
contributions
to
the
space
platform
came
on
top
of
a
personal
anxiety
on
his
own
account
you
must
be
the
first
girl
in
the
world
who
thought
about
housekeeping
in
space
girls
will
be
going
into
space
wo
they
she
asked
not
looking
at
him
if
there
are
colonies
on
the
other
planets
they
have
to
and
some
day
to
the
stars
she
stood
quite
still
and
joe
wanted
to
do
something
about
her
and
the
world
and
the
way
he
felt
the
interior
of
the
platform
was
very
silent
somewhere
far
away
where
the
insulation
was
incomplete
the
sound
of
workmen
was
audible
but
the
inner
corridors
of
the
platform
were
not
resonant
they
were
lined
with
a
material
to
destroy
reminders
that
this
was
merely
a
metal
shell
an
artificial
world
that
would
swim
in
emptiness
here
and
now
joe
and
sally
seemed
very
private
and
alone
and
he
felt
a
sense
of
urgency
he
looked
at
her
yearningly
her
color
was
a
little
higher
than
usual
she
was
not
just
a
nice
kid
she
was
swell
and
she
was
good
to
look
at
joe
had
noticed
that
before
but
now
with
the
memory
of
her
fright
because
he
been
in
danger
her
worry
because
he
might
have
been
killed
he
thought
of
her
very
absurd
but
honest
offer
to
cry
for
him
joe
found
himself
twisting
at
the
ring
on
his
finger
he
got
it
off
and
there
was
some
soot
and
grease
on
it
from
the
work
he
been
doing
he
knew
that
she
saw
what
he
was
about
but
she
looked
away
look
sally
he
said
awkwardly
we
known
each
other
a
long
time
i
uh
liked
you
a
lot
and
i
got
some
things
to
do
first
but
he
stopped
he
swallowed
she
turned
and
smiled
at
him
look
he
said
desperately
what
a
good
way
to
ask
if
you
like
to
wear
this
she
nodded
her
eyes
shining
a
little
that
was
a
good
way
joe
i
like
it
a
lot
there
was
an
interlude
then
during
which
she
very
ridiculously
cried
and
explained
that
he
must
be
more
careful
and
not
risk
his
life
so
much
and
then
there
was
a
faint
faint
sound
outside
the
platform
it
was
the
yapping
sound
of
a
siren
crying
out
in
short
and
choppy
ululations
as
it
warmed
up
finally
its
note
steadied
and
it
wailed
and
wailed
and
wailed
that
the
alarm
exclaimed
sally
she
was
still
everybody
out
of
the
shed
come
on
joe
they
started
back
the
way
they
come
in
and
sally
looked
up
at
joe
and
grinned
suddenly
when
i
have
grandchildren
she
told
him
i
going
to
brag
that
i
was
the
very
first
girl
in
all
the
world
ever
to
be
kissed
in
a
space
ship
but
before
joe
could
do
anything
about
the
comment
she
was
out
on
the
stairs
in
plain
view
and
going
down
so
he
followed
her
the
shed
was
emptying
the
bare
floor
was
dotted
with
figures
moving
steadily
toward
the
security
exit
there
was
no
hurry
because
security
men
were
shouting
that
this
was
not
an
alarm
but
a
precautionary
measure
and
there
was
no
need
for
haste
each
security
man
had
been
informed
by
the
miniature
he
wore
by
it
every
guard
could
be
told
anything
he
needed
to
know
either
on
the
floor
of
the
shed
or
on
the
catwalks
aloft
or
even
in
the
platform
itself
trucks
lined
up
in
orderly
fashion
to
go
out
the
doors
men
came
down
from
the
scaffolds
after
putting
their
tools
in
proper
positions
for
counting
and
inspection
and
other
men
were
streaming
quietly
from
the
pushpot
assembly
line
except
for
the
gigantic
object
in
the
middle
and
for
the
fact
that
every
man
was
in
work
clothes
the
scene
was
surprisingly
like
the
central
waiting
room
of
a
very
large
railroad
station
with
innumerable
people
moving
briskly
here
and
there
no
hurry
said
joe
catching
the
word
from
a
security
man
as
he
passed
it
on
i
go
see
what
my
gang
found
out
the
trio
haney
and
mike
and
the
chief
were
just
arriving
by
the
piles
of
charred
but
now
uncovered
wreckage
sally
flushed
ever
so
slightly
when
she
saw
the
chief
eye
joe
ring
on
her
finger
rest
of
the
day
off
huh
said
the
chief
look
we
found
most
of
the
stuff
we
need
they
gon
na
give
us
a
shop
to
work
in
we
move
this
stuff
there
we
gon
na
have
to
weld
a
false
frame
on
the
lathe
we
picked
an
then
cut
out
the
bed
plate
to
let
the
gyros
fit
in
between
the
chucks
mount
it
so
the
spinning
is
in
the
right
line
that
would
be
with
the
axis
of
the
rotors
parallel
to
the
axis
of
the
earth
joe
nodded
we
be
able
to
get
set
up
in
the
mornin
added
haney
and
get
started
you
got
the
parts
list
off
to
the
plant
for
your
folks
to
get
busy
on
sally
said
quickly
he
sending
that
by
facsimile
now
then
the
chief
beamed
in
benign
mockery
what
you
goin
to
do
after
that
joe
if
we
got
the
rest
of
the
day
off
sally
said
hurriedly
we
were
he
was
going
off
on
a
picnic
with
me
to
red
canyon
lake
do
you
really
need
to
talk
business
all
afternoon
the
chief
laughed
he
known
sally
at
least
by
sight
back
at
the
kenmore
plant
no
he
told
her
just
askin
i
worked
on
that
red
canyon
dam
job
years
back
that
dam
that
made
the
lake
it
ought
to
be
right
pretty
around
there
now
okay
joe
see
you
as
soon
as
work
starts
up
in
the
mornin
most
likely
joe
started
away
with
sally
mike
the
midget
called
hoarsely
joe
just
a
minute
joe
drew
back
the
midget
seamed
face
was
very
earnest
he
said
in
his
odd
voice
here
something
to
think
about
somebody
worked
mighty
hard
to
keep
you
from
getting
those
gyros
here
they
might
work
hard
to
keep
them
from
getting
repaired
that
why
we
asked
for
a
special
shop
to
work
in
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
good
way
to
stop
these
repairs
would
be
to
stop
us
not
everybody
would
figured
out
how
to
rebalance
this
thing
you
get
me
sure
said
joe
you
three
had
better
look
out
for
yourselves
mike
stared
at
him
and
grimaced
you
do
get
it
he
said
brittlely
all
right
i
may
be
crazy
at
that
joe
rejoined
sally
the
idea
of
a
picnic
was
brand
new
to
him
but
he
approved
of
it
completely
they
went
to
the
small
exit
that
led
to
the
security
building
they
were
admitted
there
was
remarkable
calm
and
efficiency
here
even
though
routine
had
been
upset
by
the
need
to
stop
all
work
as
they
went
toward
major
holt
office
joe
heard
somebody
dictating
in
a
voice
this
attempt
at
atomic
sabotage
was
defeated
outside
the
shed
but
it
never
had
a
chance
of
success
geiger
counters
would
have
instantly
shown
any
attempt
to
smuggle
radioactive
material
into
the
shed
joe
glanced
sidewise
at
sally
that
for
a
publicity
release
he
asked
she
nodded
it
true
too
nothing
goes
in
or
out
of
the
shed
without
passing
close
to
a
geiger
counter
even
watches
show
up
though
they
do
set
the
sirens
to
screaming
joe
said
i
get
my
order
for
new
parts
off
on
the
facsimile
machine
but
he
had
to
get
major
holt
secretary
to
show
him
where
to
feed
in
the
list
it
would
go
east
to
the
nearest
facsimile
receiver
and
then
be
rushed
by
special
messenger
to
the
plant
miss
ross
gloomily
set
the
machine
and
initialed
the
delivery
requisition
which
was
part
of
the
document
it
flashed
through
the
scanning
process
and
came
out
again
you
and
sally
remarked
sally
father
secretary
with
a
morose
sigh
can
go
and
relax
this
afternoon
but
there
no
relaxation
for
major
holt
or
for
me
joe
said
unhopefully
i
sure
sally
be
glad
if
you
came
with
us
major
holt
plain
unglamorous
assistant
shook
her
head
i
have
had
a
day
off
since
the
work
began
here
she
said
frowning
the
major
depends
on
me
nobody
else
could
do
what
i
do
you
going
to
red
canyon
lake
yes
agreed
joe
sally
thought
it
might
be
pleasant
it
terribly
dry
and
arid
here
said
miss
ross
sadly
that
the
only
body
of
water
in
a
hundred
miles
or
more
i
hope
it
pretty
there
i
never
seen
it
she
handed
joe
back
his
original
memo
from
the
facsimile
machine
an
exact
copy
of
his
written
list
in
his
handwriting
was
now
in
existence
more
than
fifteen
hundred
miles
away
and
would
arrive
at
the
kenmore
precision
tool
plant
within
a
matter
of
hours
there
could
be
no
question
of
errors
in
transmission
it
had
to
be
right
sally
came
out
smiled
at
her
father
secretary
and
led
joe
down
to
the
entrance
i
have
the
car
she
said
cheerfully
and
there
be
a
lunch
basket
waiting
for
us
at
the
house
i
agreed
that
the
lake
was
too
cold
for
swimming
though
it
is
snow
water
feeds
it
but
it
nice
to
look
at
they
went
out
the
door
and
the
workers
on
the
platform
were
just
beginning
to
pile
into
the
waiting
fleet
of
busses
but
the
black
car
was
waiting
too
joe
opened
the
door
and
sally
handed
him
the
key
she
regarded
the
men
swarming
on
the
busses
there
be
bulletins
all
over
bootstrap
she
observed
saying
that
braun
tried
to
the
shed
they
say
that
he
may
have
carried
the
cobalt
about
with
him
and
so
he
may
have
burned
other
people
in
a
restaurant
a
movie
theater
anywhere
while
he
was
carrying
the
dust
and
dying
without
knowing
it
so
everybody
supposed
to
report
to
the
hospital
for
a
for
radiation
burns
some
people
may
really
have
them
but
dad
thinks
that
since
you
were
burned
braun
did
carry
it
around
if
anyone
is
burned
it
be
the
person
who
brought
the
cobalt
here
to
give
him
and
well
he
turn
up
because
everybody
does
and
because
he
burned
he
be
asked
plenty
of
questions
joe
stepped
on
the
starter
then
he
pressed
the
accelerator
and
the
car
sped
forward
they
stopped
at
the
house
in
the
area
on
the
other
side
of
the
shed
sally
picked
up
the
lunch
basket
that
her
housekeeper
had
packed
on
telephoned
instructions
they
drove
away
red
canyon
was
eighty
miles
from
the
shed
and
the
only
way
to
get
there
was
through
bootstrap
because
the
only
highway
away
from
the
shed
led
to
that
small
synthetic
town
it
was
irritating
though
they
had
no
schedule
to
find
that
the
long
line
of
busses
was
ahead
of
them
on
that
stretch
the
busses
ran
nose
to
tail
and
filled
the
road
for
a
or
more
it
was
not
possible
to
pass
so
long
a
string
of
vehicles
there
was
just
enough
traffic
in
the
opposite
direction
to
make
that
impracticable
they
had
to
trail
the
line
of
busses
as
far
as
bootstrap
and
crawl
through
the
crowded
streets
once
beyond
the
town
they
came
to
a
security
stop
here
sally
pass
was
good
then
they
went
rolling
on
and
on
through
an
empty
arid
terrain
toward
the
hills
to
the
west
it
looked
remarkably
lonely
joe
thought
for
the
first
time
about
gas
he
looked
carefully
at
the
fuel
gauge
sally
shook
her
head
do
worry
plenty
of
gas
security
takes
care
of
that
when
i
said
where
we
were
going
and
that
i
wanted
the
car
dad
had
everything
checked
if
i
live
through
this
i
bet
i
stay
a
fanatic
about
cautiousness
all
my
life
joe
said
distastefully
i
suppose
it
gets
everybody
mike
the
midget
you
know
called
me
back
just
now
to
suggest
that
the
people
who
tried
to
spoil
the
gyros
might
try
to
harm
the
four
of
us
to
hinder
their
repair
it
not
just
foolishness
sally
admitted
the
strain
is
pretty
bad
especially
when
you
know
things
you
noticed
that
dad
getting
gray
that
strain
and
miss
ross
is
about
as
tense
things
leak
out
in
the
most
remarkable
way
and
dad
ca
find
out
how
once
there
was
a
case
of
sabotage
and
he
could
have
sworn
that
nobody
had
the
information
that
permitted
it
but
himself
and
miss
ross
she
had
hysterics
she
insisted
that
she
wanted
to
be
locked
up
somewhere
so
she
could
be
suspected
of
telling
anybody
anything
she
resign
tomorrow
if
she
could
ghastly
then
she
hesitated
and
smiled
faintly
in
fact
so
dad
would
worry
about
me
this
afternoon
he
took
his
eyes
off
the
road
to
glance
at
her
what
i
promised
we
would
go
swimming
and
then
she
said
awkwardly
there
are
two
pistols
in
the
glove
compartment
dad
knows
you
so
i
promised
you
put
one
in
your
pocket
up
at
the
lake
joe
drew
a
deep
breath
she
opened
the
glove
compartment
and
handed
him
a
pistol
he
looked
at
it
hammerless
a
good
safe
weapon
he
slipped
it
in
his
coat
pocket
but
he
frowned
i
was
looking
forward
to
not
worrying
for
a
while
he
said
wryly
but
now
i
have
to
remember
to
keep
looking
over
my
shoulder
all
the
time
maybe
said
sally
you
can
look
over
my
shoulder
and
i
look
over
yours
and
we
can
glance
at
each
other
occasionally
she
laughed
and
he
managed
to
smile
but
the
trace
of
a
frown
remained
on
his
forehead
joe
drove
and
drove
and
drove
once
they
came
to
a
very
small
town
it
may
have
contained
a
hundred
people
there
were
gas
pumps
and
a
restaurant
and
two
or
three
general
stores
which
were
certainly
too
many
for
the
permanent
residents
but
there
were
cow
ponies
hitched
before
the
stores
and
automobiles
were
also
in
view
the
ground
here
was
slightly
rolling
the
mountains
had
grown
to
ramparts
against
the
sky
joe
drove
carefully
down
the
single
street
turning
out
widely
once
to
dodge
a
dog
sleeping
placidly
in
an
area
normally
reserved
for
traffic
finally
they
came
to
the
foothills
and
then
the
road
curved
and
recurved
as
it
wound
among
them
and
two
hours
from
bootstrap
they
reached
red
canyon
they
first
saw
the
dam
from
downstream
it
was
a
monstrous
structure
of
masonry
alone
in
the
mountains
from
its
top
a
plume
of
falling
water
jetted
out
the
dam
for
irrigation
said
sally
professionally
and
the
shed
gets
all
its
power
from
here
one
of
dad
nightmares
is
that
somebody
may
blow
up
this
dam
and
leave
bootstrap
and
the
shed
without
power
joe
said
nothing
he
drove
on
up
the
trail
as
it
climbed
the
canyon
wall
in
hairpin
slants
it
was
ticklish
driving
but
then
quite
suddenly
they
reached
the
top
of
the
canyon
wall
and
the
top
of
the
dam
and
the
level
of
the
lake
at
once
here
there
was
a
sheet
of
water
that
reached
back
among
the
barren
hillsides
for
miles
and
miles
it
twisted
out
of
sight
there
were
small
waves
on
its
surface
and
grass
at
its
edge
there
were
young
trees
the
powerhouse
was
a
small
squat
structure
in
the
middle
of
the
dam
not
a
person
was
visible
anywhere
here
we
are
said
sally
when
joe
stopped
the
car
he
got
out
and
went
around
to
open
the
door
for
her
but
she
was
already
stepping
out
with
the
lunch
basket
in
her
hand
when
he
arrived
he
reached
for
it
and
she
held
on
and
they
moved
companionably
away
from
the
car
carrying
the
basket
between
them
there
a
nice
place
said
sally
pointing
a
small
ridge
of
rock
stretched
out
into
the
lake
and
rose
and
spread
and
formed
what
was
almost
a
miniature
island
some
fifty
feet
across
there
were
some
young
trees
on
it
sally
and
joe
climbed
down
the
slope
and
out
the
rocky
isthmus
that
connected
it
with
the
shore
sally
let
down
the
lunch
box
on
a
stone
and
laughed
for
no
reason
at
all
as
the
wind
blew
her
hair
it
was
a
cool
wind
from
over
the
water
and
joe
realized
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
the
air
felt
different
and
smelled
different
when
it
blew
over
open
water
like
this
up
to
now
he
had
thought
of
the
dryness
of
the
air
in
bootstrap
and
the
shed
the
lunch
basket
was
tilted
a
little
joe
picked
it
up
and
settled
it
more
solidly
then
he
said
hungry
there
was
literally
nothing
on
his
mind
at
the
moment
but
the
luxurious
satisfied
feeling
of
being
off
somewhere
with
grass
and
a
lake
and
sally
and
a
good
part
of
the
afternoon
to
throw
away
it
felt
good
so
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
lunch
basket
there
was
a
revolver
there
it
was
the
other
one
from
the
glove
compartment
of
the
car
sally
had
left
it
behind
joe
regarded
it
and
said
ironically
happy
carefree
youth
that
us
which
are
the
ham
sandwiches
sally
nevertheless
the
afternoon
began
splendidly
joe
dunked
the
bottled
soft
drinks
in
the
lake
to
cool
then
he
and
sally
ate
and
talked
and
laughed
joe
in
particular
had
more
than
the
usual
capacity
for
enjoyment
today
he
been
through
hours
of
turmoil
but
now
things
began
to
look
better
and
there
was
the
arrangement
with
sally
which
had
a
solid
satisfactoriness
about
it
sally
was
swell
if
been
homely
joe
would
have
liked
her
just
the
same
to
talk
to
and
to
be
with
but
she
was
pretty
and
she
was
wearing
his
ring
she
wrapped
some
string
around
the
inside
of
the
band
to
make
it
fit
the
only
trouble
was
that
joe
was
occasionally
conscious
of
the
heavy
weight
in
his
coat
pocket
but
they
spent
at
least
an
hour
in
contented
satisfying
meaningless
loafing
that
nobody
can
describe
but
that
everybody
likes
to
remember
afterward
from
time
to
time
joe
looked
ashore
when
the
weight
in
his
pocket
reminded
him
of
danger
but
he
did
look
often
enough
he
was
pulling
the
chilled
bottles
out
of
the
lake
when
he
saw
a
movement
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
whirled
his
hand
in
his
pocket
it
was
the
chief
with
haney
and
mike
the
midget
they
were
striding
across
the
rocky
small
peninsula
haney
called
sharply
everything
okay
sure
said
joe
everything
fine
what
the
matter
mike
had
a
hunch
said
the
chief
and
uh
i
remembered
i
worked
on
the
job
when
this
dam
was
built
years
ago
he
looked
about
him
it
looked
different
then
then
he
caught
joe
eye
and
jerked
his
head
almost
imperceptibly
to
one
side
joe
caught
the
signal
i
see
about
some
more
soft
drinks
he
said
come
help
me
fish
up
the
bottles
sally
smiled
at
the
other
two
she
was
already
inspecting
the
lunch
basket
we
still
have
some
sandwiches
she
said
hospitably
and
some
cake
haney
came
forward
awkwardly
mike
advanced
toward
her
with
something
of
truculence
joe
knew
what
was
in
his
mind
if
sally
treated
him
like
a
freak
but
joe
knew
with
deep
satisfaction
that
she
would
he
went
down
to
the
water
edge
what
up
chief
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
mike
hadda
hunch
rumbled
the
chief
somebody
tried
to
smash
the
stuff
you
brought
they
did
but
we
started
gettin
set
to
mend
it
so
what
would
they
do
polish
us
off
if
they
were
set
to
the
whole
shed
an
everybody
in
it
they
would
stop
at
four
more
murders
joe
fished
for
a
pop
bottle
mike
said
something
like
that
back
at
the
shed
he
observed
yeah
but
you
were
the
one
who
figured
things
out
you
be
first
target
haney
and
mike
and
me
we
be
hard
to
knock
off
in
a
crowd
in
bootstrap
but
you
and
her
headed
off
by
mike
figured
you
might
be
safe
so
we
checked
joe
brought
up
one
bottle
and
then
another
we
all
right
have
seen
a
soul
do
mean
a
soul
has
seen
you
growled
the
chief
a
car
left
bootstrap
less
than
twenty
minutes
behind
you
there
were
three
guys
in
it
it
parked
down
below
the
dam
outa
sight
we
saw
it
and
when
we
came
up
careful
we
spotted
three
guys
hidin
out
behind
the
rocks
yonder
they
look
to
me
like
they
waiting
for
somebody
to
go
strolling
back
from
the
shoreline
so
uh
maybe
folks
out
at
the
powerhouse
ca
see
that
be
you
and
her
huh
joe
went
cold
not
for
himself
for
sally
there
nobody
else
around
said
the
chief
who
they
be
waiting
for
but
you
two
suppose
they
got
a
chance
to
kill
you
they
take
the
car
keys
they
drop
your
two
bodies
somewheres
gawdknowswhere
there
be
considerable
of
a
hunt
for
you
two
major
holt
would
be
upset
plenty
security
might
get
loosened
up
there
might
be
breaks
for
guys
who
wanted
to
do
a
little
extra
sabotage
besides
maybe
hamperin
the
repairin
of
the
pilot
gyros
then
they
could
try
for
haney
and
mike
and
me
joe
said
coldly
i
got
a
pistol
and
so
has
sally
shall
we
take
those
pistols
and
go
ask
those
three
if
they
want
to
start
something
the
chief
snorted
use
sense
it
good
you
got
the
pistols
though
i
snagged
a
rifle
from
a
shooting
gallery
it
was
all
i
could
get
in
a
hurry
but
go
huntin
trouble
fella
i
want
to
see
that
platform
go
up
i
take
care
of
things
now
good
layout
here
they
got
to
come
across
the
open
to
get
near
do
say
anything
to
sally
but
we
keep
our
eyes
open
joe
nodded
he
carried
the
chilled
dripping
bottles
back
to
where
haney
solemnly
ate
a
sandwich
sitting
crosslegged
with
his
back
to
the
lake
and
regarding
the
shore
the
chief
dragged
a
repeating
rifle
from
inside
his
belt
where
it
had
hung
alongside
his
thigh
he
casually
strolled
over
to
mike
and
dropped
the
rifle
you
said
you
felt
like
target
practice
he
remarked
blandly
your
armament
any
more
sandwiches
sally
smilingly
passed
him
the
last
she
left
the
top
of
the
basket
open
the
pistol
that
had
been
there
was
gone
then
sally
eyes
met
joe
and
she
was
aware
that
his
three
friends
had
not
come
here
merely
to
crash
a
picnic
but
she
took
it
in
stride
it
was
an
additional
reason
for
joe
to
approve
of
sally
me
said
the
chief
largely
i
goin
to
swim
i
have
had
any
more
water
around
me
than
a
shower
bath
for
so
long
that
i
crave
to
soak
and
splash
i
go
yonder
and
dunk
myself
he
wandered
off
taking
bites
from
the
sandwich
as
he
went
he
vanished
haney
leaned
back
against
a
sapling
his
eyes
roving
about
the
shoreline
and
the
rocks
and
brush
behind
it
mike
was
talking
in
his
crackling
voice
but
just
the
same
it
crazy
fighting
sabotage
when
we
little
guys
could
take
over
in
a
week
and
make
sabotage
just
plain
foolish
we
could
do
the
whole
job
while
the
saboteurs
were
looking
sally
said
with
interest
have
you
got
the
figures
were
they
ever
passed
on
i
spent
a
month
pay
once
said
mike
sardonically
hiring
a
math
shark
to
go
over
them
he
found
one
mistake
it
raised
the
margin
of
what
we
could
do
sally
answered
joe
listen
to
this
mike
says
he
has
the
real
answer
to
sabotage
and
in
a
way
to
space
travel
listen
joe
dropped
to
the
ground
shoot
it
he
said
he
was
grimly
alert
just
the
same
there
were
men
waiting
for
them
to
start
back
to
the
car
these
saboteurs
were
armed
and
they
intended
to
murder
sally
and
himself
joe
jaws
clamped
tautly
shut
at
the
grim
ideas
that
came
into
his
mind
but
mike
was
beginning
to
speak
forget
about
the
platform
a
minute
he
said
standing
up
to
gesticulate
because
he
was
only
three
and
a
half
feet
high
just
figure
on
a
rocket
straight
to
the
moon
with
rockets
a
had
to
have
a
mass
ratio
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
to
one
you
have
to
burn
a
hundred
and
twenty
tons
of
fuel
to
land
one
ton
on
the
moon
now
it
could
be
done
with
sixty
and
when
the
platform
up
that
figure
drop
again
okay
you
gon
na
land
a
man
on
the
moon
he
weighs
two
hundred
pounds
he
uses
up
twenty
pounds
of
food
and
drink
and
oxygen
a
day
give
him
grub
and
air
for
two
months
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
cabin
seven
feet
high
and
ten
feet
across
sixteen
hundred
pounds
counting
insulation
an
braces
for
strength
that
makes
a
pay
load
of
a
ton
an
a
half
and
you
have
to
burn
a
hundred
an
eighty
tons
of
fuel
to
take
it
to
the
moon
and
another
hundred
twenty
for
every
ton
the
rocket
ship
weighed
you
might
get
a
man
to
the
moon
with
a
rocket
maybe
that
with
the
old
fuels
he
get
there
an
he
live
two
months
an
then
he
die
for
lack
of
air
with
the
new
fuels
you
need
ninety
tons
of
fuel
to
carry
the
guy
there
and
sixty
more
for
every
ton
the
ship
weighed
itself
call
it
six
hundred
tons
for
the
rocket
to
carry
one
man
to
the
moon
sally
nodded
absorbedly
i
seen
figures
like
that
she
agreed
but
take
a
guy
like
me
said
mike
the
midget
bitterly
i
weigh
pounds
not
two
hundred
i
use
four
pounds
of
food
and
air
a
day
a
cabin
for
me
to
live
in
would
be
four
feet
high
an
five
across
bein
smaller
it
would
need
so
much
bracing
you
could
do
it
for
two
hundred
pounds
three
hundred
for
grub
and
air
fifty
for
me
me
on
the
moon
supplied
for
two
months
would
come
to
pounds
sixteen
tons
of
fuel
to
get
me
to
the
moon
direct
to
carry
the
weight
of
the
ship
it
smaller
fifty
tons
maximum
i
see
said
sally
frowning
he
looked
at
her
suspiciously
but
there
was
no
mockery
in
her
face
it
take
a
rocket
to
get
a
man
to
the
moon
he
said
with
sudden
flippancy
but
a
guy
my
size
could
do
the
same
job
of
stranglin
in
a
job
counting
how
much
easier
be
to
get
back
with
atmosphere
deceleration
i
could
make
a
trip
land
take
observations
pick
up
mineral
specimens
and
get
back
all
in
a
rocket
that
just
ten
per
cent
of
what
it
cost
to
take
a
man
one
way
he
stamped
his
foot
then
he
said
coldly
haney
sittin
still
you
a
sittin
duck
the
comment
was
just
joe
knew
that
sally
was
on
the
lakeward
side
of
this
small
island
and
that
there
were
impenetrable
rocks
between
her
and
the
mainland
but
haney
sat
crosslegged
where
he
could
watch
the
mainland
and
he
had
moved
in
a
long
while
if
someone
did
intend
to
commit
murder
from
a
distance
haney
was
offering
a
chance
for
a
very
fine
target
he
moved
yeah
said
mike
with
fine
irony
reverting
to
his
topic
i
could
show
you
plenty
of
figures
there
are
other
guys
like
me
we
got
as
much
brains
as
people
if
the
big
brass
had
figured
on
us
small
guys
they
coulda
made
the
platform
the
size
of
a
house
it
ha
been
up
in
the
sky
right
now
with
guys
like
me
running
it
guys
my
size
could
man
the
ferry
rockets
bringin
up
fuel
for
storage
and
four
of
us
could
take
a
rocket
an
slide
out
to
mars
an
be
back
by
springtime
next
springtime
with
all
the
facts
and
the
photographs
to
prove
by
golly
then
he
made
a
raging
helpless
gesture
but
that
just
the
big
picture
he
said
bitterly
right
now
right
at
this
minute
we
could
make
it
easy
to
finish
the
platform
the
way
it
building
in
the
shed
there
are
ferry
rockets
building
somewhere
else
you
know
about
them
sally
said
apologetically
yes
i
know
there
be
smaller
rocket
ships
going
up
to
the
platform
they
carry
fuel
and
stores
and
exchanges
for
the
crew
yes
i
know
there
are
ferry
rockets
building
those
ferry
rockets
said
mike
sardonically
carry
four
men
plus
two
replacements
for
the
crew
they
carry
air
for
ten
days
but
put
four
of
us
small
guys
in
a
ferry
rocket
have
air
and
grub
for
two
months
almost
pull
out
the
pay
load
and
put
in
a
hydroponic
garden
and
communicators
and
we
a
platform
right
then
send
up
another
ferry
rocket
to
join
us
and
it
could
bring
guided
missiles
the
ferry
rockets
could
be
finished
quicker
than
the
platform
send
up
three
ferry
rockets
with
midgets
as
crews
an
we
could
weld
together
and
have
a
space
platform
in
orbit
and
working
and
what
be
the
use
of
sabotaging
the
big
platform
then
the
job
would
be
done
there
be
no
sense
sabotaging
the
big
platform
because
the
little
one
could
do
anything
the
big
one
could
it
be
up
there
and
working
but
he
demanded
bitterly
do
you
think
anybody
do
anything
as
sensible
as
that
his
small
features
were
twisted
in
angry
rebellion
and
he
was
quite
right
in
all
his
reasoning
mankind
could
have
made
the
journey
to
the
planets
in
a
hurry
and
it
could
have
had
its
space
platform
in
the
sky
much
more
quickly
if
only
it
could
have
consented
to
be
represented
by
people
like
mike
who
would
have
represented
mankind
very
valiantly
sally
said
distressedly
oh
mike
it
all
true
and
i
so
sorry
and
she
meant
it
joe
liked
sally
especially
right
then
because
she
did
patronize
mike
or
try
to
reason
him
out
of
his
heartbreak
then
haney
said
abruptly
somebody
spotted
the
chief
joe
mentally
kicked
himself
the
chief
had
said
he
was
going
to
swim
now
but
only
now
joe
looked
to
see
what
he
was
doing
he
was
far
out
from
shore
swimming
unhurriedly
to
the
powerhouse
at
the
middle
of
the
dam
he
would
reach
it
and
swing
up
the
ladder
that
could
just
be
seen
going
down
the
lake
side
of
the
dam
top
and
he
would
explain
the
situation
on
shore
a
telephone
call
to
bootstrap
would
bring
security
men
rushing
at
eighty
miles
an
hour
and
parachute
troopers
a
good
deal
faster
but
even
before
they
arrived
the
chief
would
lead
the
powerhouse
crew
ashore
armed
with
the
shotguns
they
kept
for
shooting
waterfowl
in
and
out
of
season
the
men
on
shore
might
or
might
not
consider
the
chief
swim
to
be
proof
that
he
knew
their
intentions
they
were
probably
discussing
the
matter
in
some
agitation
right
now
but
they
could
know
that
the
party
on
the
was
armed
suddenly
mike
said
crisply
we
goin
to
have
visitors
he
lay
down
carefully
on
the
ground
fifteen
feet
uphill
from
sally
where
he
could
look
over
the
ridge
he
snuggled
the
target
rifle
professionally
to
his
shoulder
he
drew
a
bead
three
men
very
casually
strolled
out
of
the
brushwood
on
the
shore
they
moved
nonchalantly
toward
the
strand
of
rocks
that
led
out
to
the
picnic
spot
they
looked
like
anybody
else
from
bootstrap
casual
rough
work
clothing
haney
bent
down
and
picked
up
four
good
throwing
stones
his
expression
was
pained
joe
said
we
got
pistols
haney
and
sally
a
good
shot
the
men
came
on
their
manner
was
elaborately
casual
joe
stepped
up
into
view
no
visitors
he
called
we
do
want
company
one
of
the
men
held
his
hand
to
his
ear
as
if
not
understanding
they
came
on
they
made
no
threatening
gestures
then
joe
took
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
the
pistol
sally
given
him
gripped
tightly
i
mean
that
he
said
harshly
stand
back
one
of
the
three
spoke
sharply
on
that
instant
three
pistols
appeared
bullets
whined
as
the
men
hurtled
forward
the
purpose
was
not
so
much
murder
at
this
moment
as
the
demoralizing
effect
of
bullets
flying
overhead
while
the
three
assassins
got
close
enough
to
do
their
bloody
job
with
precision
a
stone
whizzed
by
joe
haney
had
thrown
it
and
the
small
target
rifle
in
mike
hands
coughed
twice
joe
held
his
fire
he
had
only
six
bullets
and
three
targets
to
hit
with
a
familiar
revolver
he
have
started
shooting
now
but
thirty
yards
is
a
long
range
with
a
strange
pistol
at
a
moving
target
one
of
the
three
killers
stumbled
and
crashed
to
the
ground
a
second
seemed
suddenly
to
be
grinning
widely
on
one
side
of
his
face
a
bullet
had
slashed
his
cheek
the
third
ran
head
on
into
a
rock
thrown
by
haney
it
knocked
the
breath
out
of
him
and
his
pistol
fell
from
his
hand
joe
fired
deliberately
at
the
widely
grinning
man
and
saw
him
spin
around
mike
target
rifle
spat
again
and
the
man
joe
had
hit
wheeled
and
ran
heavily
making
incoherent
yells
the
one
who
tumbled
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
fled
hopping
crazily
favoring
one
leg
deserted
the
third
man
turned
and
ran
too
still
doubled
over
and
still
gasping
mike
voice
crackled
he
was
in
a
towering
rage
because
of
the
way
the
target
rifle
shot
it
threw
high
and
to
the
right
the
shooting
gallery
paid
off
in
cigarettes
for
high
scores
so
the
guns
did
shoot
straight
until
this
moment
joe
had
been
relatively
calm
because
he
had
something
to
do
but
just
then
he
heard
sally
say
oh
in
a
queer
voice
he
whirled
unknown
to
him
she
had
not
been
waiting
under
cover
but
standing
with
her
pistol
out
and
ready
and
her
face
was
very
white
and
she
was
plucking
at
her
hair
a
strand
came
away
in
her
fingers
a
bullet
had
clipped
it
just
above
her
shoulder
then
joe
went
sick
weak
trembling
and
he
disgraced
himself
by
grabbing
sally
and
demanding
to
know
if
she
was
hurt
and
raging
at
her
for
exposing
herself
to
fire
while
his
throat
tried
to
close
and
shut
off
his
breath
from
horror
there
came
loud
noises
with
the
peculiar
reverberation
of
sound
over
water
two
motorcycles
started
from
the
powerhouse
along
the
crest
of
the
dam
they
streaked
for
the
shore
carrying
five
men
one
of
whom
was
the
chief
with
a
tablecloth
about
his
middle
brandishing
a
fire
axe
in
default
of
other
weapons
the
danger
was
over
but
the
assassins
could
be
followed
immediately
they
still
had
at
least
two
pistols
eight
men
and
a
girl
counting
mike
with
an
armament
of
only
two
pistols
a
rifle
two
shotguns
and
a
fire
axe
were
not
a
properly
equipped
posse
to
hunt
down
killers
also
by
now
it
was
close
to
sunset
so
the
victors
did
the
sensible
thing
joe
and
sally
and
haney
and
the
chief
his
clothes
retrieved
plus
mike
headed
back
for
bootstrap
joe
and
sally
rode
in
the
major
black
car
and
the
other
three
in
the
jalopy
they
rented
for
the
afternoon
on
the
way
into
the
canyon
below
the
dam
they
stopped
at
the
parked
car
their
assassins
had
come
in
they
removed
its
distributor
and
fan
belt
the
other
men
returned
to
the
powerhouse
with
their
shotguns
and
the
fire
axe
and
telephoned
to
bootstrap
the
three
gunmen
who
had
planned
murder
became
fugitives
with
no
means
of
transportation
but
their
legs
they
had
a
good
many
thousand
square
miles
of
territory
to
hide
in
but
it
likely
that
they
had
food
or
any
competence
to
find
it
in
the
wilds
two
were
certainly
hurt
with
dogs
and
planes
and
organization
it
should
be
possible
to
catch
them
handily
come
morning
so
joe
and
sally
drove
back
to
bootstrap
with
the
other
car
following
closely
through
all
the
miles
that
had
to
be
covered
in
the
dark
halfway
back
they
met
a
grim
search
party
in
cars
heading
for
the
dam
to
begin
their
man
hunt
in
the
morning
after
that
joe
felt
better
but
his
teeth
still
tended
to
chatter
every
time
he
thought
of
startled
scared
expression
as
she
pulled
away
a
lock
of
her
hair
that
had
been
severed
by
a
bullet
when
they
got
back
to
the
shed
major
holt
looked
tired
and
old
sally
explained
breathlessly
that
her
danger
was
her
own
fault
joe
thought
she
was
safely
under
cover
it
was
my
fault
said
the
major
detachedly
i
let
you
go
away
from
the
shed
i
do
not
blame
joe
at
all
but
he
did
not
look
kindly
joe
wet
his
lips
ready
to
agree
that
any
disgrace
he
might
be
subjected
to
was
justified
since
he
had
caused
sally
to
be
shot
at
i
blame
myself
a
great
deal
sir
he
said
grimly
but
i
can
promise
i
never
take
sally
away
from
safety
again
not
until
the
up
and
there
no
more
reason
for
her
to
be
in
danger
the
major
said
remotely
i
shall
have
to
arrange
for
more
than
that
i
shall
put
you
in
touch
with
your
father
by
telephone
you
will
explain
to
him
in
detail
exactly
how
the
repair
of
your
apparatus
is
planned
i
understand
that
the
gyros
can
be
duplicated
more
quickly
by
the
method
you
have
worked
out
joe
said
yes
sir
the
balancing
of
the
gyros
can
which
was
the
longest
single
job
but
anything
can
be
made
quicker
the
second
time
the
patterns
for
the
castings
are
all
made
and
the
bugs
worked
out
of
the
production
process
you
will
explain
that
to
your
father
said
the
major
heavily
your
father
plant
will
begin
to
duplicate
these
ah
pilot
gyros
at
once
meanwhile
your
ah
work
crew
will
start
to
repair
the
one
that
is
here
yes
sir
and
said
the
major
i
am
sending
you
to
the
pushpot
airfield
i
intend
to
scatter
the
targets
the
saboteurs
might
aim
at
you
are
one
of
them
your
crew
is
another
from
time
to
time
you
will
confer
with
them
and
verify
their
work
if
any
of
them
should
be
disposed
of
you
will
be
able
to
instruct
others
it
really
the
other
way
about
sir
objected
joe
the
chief
and
haney
are
pretty
good
and
mike
got
brains
the
major
moved
impatiently
i
am
looking
at
this
from
a
security
standpoint
he
said
i
am
trying
to
make
it
plainly
useless
to
attack
the
gyros
again
duplicates
will
be
in
production
at
your
father
plant
there
will
be
three
men
repairing
the
smashed
ones
there
will
be
another
man
in
another
place
and
this
will
be
you
who
can
instruct
new
workmen
in
the
repair
procedure
if
anything
should
happen
thus
there
will
have
to
be
three
separate
successful
coups
if
the
pilot
gyros
are
not
to
be
ready
when
the
platform
needs
them
saboteurs
might
try
one
possibly
two
but
i
think
they
will
look
for
another
weak
spot
to
attack
joe
did
not
like
the
idea
of
being
moved
away
he
wanted
to
be
on
the
job
repairing
the
device
that
was
primarily
his
responsibility
besides
he
had
a
feeling
about
sally
if
she
were
in
danger
he
wanted
to
be
on
hand
about
sally
sir
sally
said
the
major
tiredly
is
going
to
have
to
restrict
herself
to
the
point
where
she
feel
that
jail
would
be
preferable
but
she
will
see
the
need
for
it
she
will
be
guarded
a
good
deal
more
carefully
than
before
and
you
may
not
know
it
but
she
has
been
guarded
rather
well
joe
saw
sally
smiling
ruefully
at
him
what
the
major
had
said
was
unpleasant
but
he
was
right
this
was
one
of
those
arrangements
that
nobody
likes
an
irritating
uncomfortable
disappointing
necessity
but
such
necessities
are
a
part
of
every
actual
achievement
the
difference
between
things
that
get
done
and
things
that
do
get
done
is
often
merely
the
difference
between
patience
and
impatience
with
tedious
details
this
arrangement
would
mean
that
joe
could
see
sally
very
often
it
would
mean
that
the
chief
and
haney
and
mike
would
do
the
actual
work
of
getting
the
gyros
ready
it
would
take
all
the
glamour
out
of
joe
contribution
these
deprivations
should
be
necessary
but
they
were
all
right
sir
said
joe
gloomily
when
do
i
go
over
to
the
field
right
away
said
the
major
tonight
then
he
added
detachedly
officially
the
excuse
for
your
presence
there
will
be
that
you
have
been
useful
in
uncovering
sabotage
methods
you
have
after
all
through
you
a
number
of
planes
that
would
have
been
blown
up
have
now
had
their
booby
traps
removed
i
know
you
do
not
claim
credit
for
the
fact
but
it
is
an
excuse
for
keeping
you
where
i
want
you
to
be
for
another
reason
entirely
so
it
will
be
assumed
that
you
are
at
the
pushpot
field
for
inspection
the
major
nodded
dismissal
with
an
indefinable
air
of
irony
and
joe
went
unhappily
out
of
his
office
he
telephoned
his
father
at
length
his
father
did
not
share
joe
disappointment
at
being
removed
to
a
place
of
safety
he
undertook
to
begin
the
castings
for
an
entire
new
set
of
pilot
gyros
at
once
a
little
later
sally
came
out
of
her
father
office
i
sorry
joe
he
grinned
unhappily
so
am
i
do
feel
very
heroic
but
if
this
is
what
has
to
be
done
to
get
the
platform
out
of
the
shed
and
on
the
way
up
it
what
has
to
be
done
i
suppose
i
can
phone
you
you
can
said
sally
and
you
better
they
had
talked
a
long
time
that
afternoon
very
satisfyingly
and
without
any
cares
at
all
neither
could
have
remembered
much
of
what
had
been
said
it
probably
was
not
in
importance
but
now
there
seemed
to
be
a
very
great
deal
of
other
similar
conversation
urgently
needing
to
be
gone
through
i
call
you
said
joe
then
somebody
approached
to
take
him
to
the
pushpot
airfield
they
separated
very
formally
under
the
eyes
of
the
impersonal
security
officer
who
would
drive
joe
to
his
destination
it
was
a
tedious
journey
through
the
darkness
this
particular
security
officer
was
not
companionable
he
was
one
of
those
conscientious
people
who
think
that
if
they
keep
their
mouths
shut
it
will
make
up
for
their
inability
to
keep
their
eyes
open
socially
he
treated
joe
as
if
he
were
a
highly
suspect
person
it
could
be
guessed
that
he
treated
everybody
that
way
joe
went
to
sleep
in
the
car
he
was
only
when
he
arrived
and
he
did
bother
to
rouse
himself
completely
when
he
was
shown
to
a
cubbyhole
in
the
barracks
he
went
to
bed
making
a
note
to
buy
himself
some
clothes
especially
fresh
linen
in
the
morning
then
he
knew
nothing
until
he
was
awaked
in
the
early
morning
by
what
sounded
exactly
like
the
crack
of
doom
it
was
not
however
the
crack
of
doom
when
joe
stared
out
the
window
by
the
head
of
his
cot
he
saw
dawn
breaking
over
the
landing
field
there
were
low
featureless
structures
silhouetted
against
the
sunrise
as
the
crimson
light
grew
brighter
joe
realized
that
the
angular
shapes
were
hangars
improbable
crane
poles
loomed
above
them
one
was
in
motion
handling
something
he
could
not
make
out
but
the
noise
that
had
awakened
him
was
less
now
it
seemed
to
circle
overhead
and
it
had
an
angry
droning
buzzing
quality
that
was
not
natural
in
any
motor
he
had
ever
heard
before
joe
shivered
standing
at
the
window
it
was
cold
and
dank
in
the
dawn
light
at
this
altitude
but
he
wanted
to
know
what
that
completely
unbelievable
roar
had
been
a
crane
beam
by
the
hangars
tilted
down
slowly
and
then
lifted
as
if
released
of
a
great
weight
the
light
was
growing
slowly
brighter
joe
saw
something
on
the
ground
rather
it
was
not
quite
on
the
ground
it
rested
on
something
on
the
ground
suddenly
that
unholy
uproar
began
again
something
moved
it
ran
heavily
out
from
the
masking
dark
of
the
hangars
it
picked
up
speed
it
acquired
a
reasonable
velocity
forty
or
fifty
miles
an
hour
as
it
scuttled
over
the
dimly
lighted
field
it
made
a
din
like
all
the
boiler
factories
in
the
world
and
all
the
backfiring
motors
in
creation
trying
to
drown
each
other
noise
out
and
all
of
them
being
very
successful
it
was
a
pushpot
joe
recognized
it
with
incredulity
it
was
one
of
those
utterly
ungainly
creations
that
were
built
around
one
half
of
the
sidewall
of
the
shed
in
shape
its
upper
part
was
like
the
top
half
of
a
loaf
of
bread
in
motion
here
it
rested
on
some
sort
of
wheeled
vehicle
and
it
was
reared
up
like
an
indignant
caterpillar
and
a
flame
squirted
out
of
its
tail
with
coy
and
frolicsome
flirtings
from
side
to
side
the
pushpot
lifted
from
the
vehicle
on
which
it
rode
and
the
vehicle
put
on
speed
and
got
away
from
under
it
with
frantic
agility
the
vehicle
swerved
to
one
side
and
joe
stared
with
amazed
eyes
at
the
pushpot
some
twenty
feet
aloft
it
had
a
flat
underside
and
a
topside
that
still
looked
to
him
like
the
rounded
top
half
of
a
loaf
of
bread
it
hung
in
the
air
at
an
angle
of
about
degrees
and
it
howled
like
a
dragon
joe
was
getting
his
metaphors
mixed
by
this
time
and
it
swung
and
wobbled
and
slowly
gained
altitude
and
then
suddenly
it
seemed
to
get
the
knack
of
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
it
started
to
circle
around
and
then
it
began
abruptly
to
climb
skyward
until
it
began
to
climb
it
looked
heavy
and
clumsy
and
wholly
unimpressive
but
when
it
climbed
it
really
moved
joe
found
his
head
out
the
window
craning
up
to
look
at
it
its
unearthly
din
took
on
the
indignant
quality
of
an
irritated
beehive
but
it
climbed
it
went
up
without
grace
but
with
astonishing
speed
and
it
was
huge
but
it
became
lost
in
the
dawn
sky
while
joe
still
gaped
joe
flung
on
his
clothes
he
went
out
the
door
through
resonant
empty
corridors
hunting
for
somebody
to
tell
him
something
he
blundered
into
a
mess
hall
there
were
many
tables
but
the
chairs
around
them
were
pushed
back
as
if
used
and
then
left
behind
by
people
in
a
hurry
to
be
somewhere
else
there
were
exactly
two
people
still
visible
over
in
a
corner
another
din
like
the
wailing
of
a
baby
volcano
with
a
toothache
it
began
and
moved
and
went
through
the
series
of
changes
that
ended
in
a
climbing
droning
hum
another
another
the
launching
of
pushpots
for
their
morning
flight
was
evidently
getting
well
under
way
joe
hesitated
in
the
nearly
empty
mess
hall
then
he
recognized
the
two
seated
figures
they
were
the
pilot
and
respectively
of
the
fateful
plane
that
had
brought
him
to
bootstrap
he
went
over
to
their
table
the
pilot
nodded
the
grinned
both
still
wore
bandages
on
their
hands
which
would
account
for
their
remaining
here
fancy
seeing
you
said
the
cheerfully
welcome
to
the
hotel
de
gink
but
do
tell
me
you
going
to
fly
a
pushpot
i
had
figured
on
it
admitted
joe
are
you
perish
forbid
said
the
amiably
i
tried
it
once
for
the
devil
of
it
those
things
fly
with
the
grace
of
a
lady
elephant
on
ice
skates
did
you
by
any
chance
notice
that
they
have
got
any
wings
and
did
you
notice
where
their
control
surfaces
were
joe
shook
his
head
he
saw
the
remnants
of
ham
and
eggs
and
coffee
he
was
hungry
there
was
the
uproar
to
be
expected
of
a
banshee
in
pain
another
pushpot
was
taking
off
how
do
i
get
breakfast
he
asked
the
pointed
to
a
chair
he
rapped
sharply
on
a
drinking
glass
a
door
opened
he
pointed
at
joe
and
the
door
closed
breakfast
coming
up
said
the
look
i
know
you
joe
kenmore
i
brick
talley
and
this
is
captain
no
less
than
captain
thomas
walton
impressed
very
much
said
joe
he
sat
down
what
about
the
control
surfaces
on
pushpots
they
in
the
jet
blast
said
the
now
identified
as
brick
talley
like
the
v
two
rockets
when
the
germans
made
vanes
in
the
exhaust
blast
no
kidding
landing
and
skidding
in
on
their
tails
like
they
do
they
have
speed
enough
to
give
wing
flaps
a
grip
on
the
air
even
if
they
had
wings
to
put
wing
flaps
on
those
dinkuses
are
things
to
have
bad
dreams
about
again
a
door
opened
and
a
man
in
uniform
with
an
apron
in
front
came
marching
in
with
a
tray
there
was
tomato
juice
and
ham
and
eggs
and
coffee
he
served
joe
briskly
and
marched
out
again
that
hotel
de
gink
service
said
talley
no
wasted
motion
no
sloppy
civilities
he
was
about
to
eat
that
himself
he
gave
it
to
you
and
now
he
cook
himself
a
double
portion
of
everything
what
are
you
doing
here
anyhow
joe
shrugged
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
neither
be
wise
nor
creditable
to
say
that
he
been
sent
here
to
split
up
a
target
at
which
saboteurs
might
shoot
i
guess
i
attached
for
rations
he
observed
there
be
orders
along
about
me
presently
i
suppose
then
i
know
what
it
all
about
he
fell
to
on
his
breakfast
the
thunderous
noises
of
the
pushpots
taking
off
made
the
mess
hall
quiver
joe
said
between
mouthfuls
funny
way
for
anything
to
take
off
riding
on
it
looked
like
a
truck
it
is
a
truck
said
talley
a
truck
fifty
of
them
specially
made
to
serve
as
undercarriages
so
pushpot
pilots
can
practice
the
pushpots
are
really
only
expected
to
work
once
you
know
joe
nodded
they
are
to
take
off
talley
explained
not
in
theory
they
hang
on
to
the
platform
and
heave
they
go
up
with
it
pushing
when
they
get
it
as
high
as
they
can
they
shoot
their
jatos
let
go
and
come
bumbling
back
home
so
they
have
to
practice
getting
back
home
and
landing
for
practicing
it
does
matter
how
they
get
aloft
when
they
get
down
a
big
straddle
truck
on
caterpillar
treads
picks
them
up
they
land
in
the
doggonedest
places
sometimes
and
brings
back
then
a
crane
heaves
them
up
on
a
truck
and
they
do
it
all
over
again
joe
considered
while
he
ate
it
made
sense
the
function
of
the
pushpots
was
to
serve
as
the
first
booster
stage
of
a
rocket
together
they
would
lift
the
platform
off
the
ground
and
get
it
as
high
as
their
jet
motors
would
take
it
traveling
east
at
the
topmost
speed
they
could
manage
then
they
fire
their
jatos
simultaneously
and
in
doing
that
they
be
acting
as
the
second
booster
stage
of
a
rocket
then
their
work
would
be
done
and
their
only
remaining
purpose
would
be
to
get
their
pilots
back
to
the
ground
alive
while
the
platform
on
its
own
third
stage
shot
out
to
space
so
said
talley
since
their
pilots
need
to
practice
landings
the
trucks
get
them
off
the
ground
they
go
up
to
fifty
thousand
feet
just
to
give
their
oxygen
tanks
a
chance
to
conk
out
on
them
then
they
barge
around
up
there
a
while
the
advanced
trainees
shoot
off
a
jato
at
top
speed
it
gauged
to
build
them
up
to
the
speed
they
give
the
platform
and
then
if
they
come
out
of
that
and
get
back
down
to
ground
safely
they
uncross
their
fingers
a
merry
life
those
guys
lead
when
a
man
made
ten
complete
flights
he
retires
one
flight
a
week
thereafter
to
keep
in
practice
only
until
the
big
day
for
the
platform
those
guys
sweat
is
it
that
bad
the
pilot
grunted
the
talley
spread
out
his
hands
it
is
that
bad
every
so
often
one
of
them
comes
down
untidily
something
the
matter
with
the
motors
they
got
a
little
too
much
power
maybe
sometimes
occasionally
they
explode
jet
motors
asked
joe
explode
that
news
a
strictly
special
feature
said
talley
drily
exclusive
with
pushpots
for
the
platform
they
run
and
run
and
run
on
test
nothing
happens
but
occasionally
one
blows
up
in
flight
once
it
happened
warming
up
that
was
a
mess
the
field
been
losing
two
pilots
a
week
lately
more
it
does
sound
exactly
reasonable
said
joe
slowly
he
put
a
last
forkful
in
his
mouth
it
also
inconvenient
said
talley
for
the
pilots
the
pilot
walton
opened
his
mouth
it
be
sabotage
he
said
curtly
if
there
was
any
way
to
do
it
four
pilots
killed
this
week
he
lapsed
into
silence
again
joe
considered
he
frowned
a
pushpot
outside
the
building
hysterically
bellowed
its
way
across
the
runway
and
its
noise
changed
and
it
was
aloft
it
went
spiraling
up
and
up
joe
stirred
his
coffee
there
were
thin
shoutings
outside
a
screaming
whistling
noise
a
crash
something
metallic
shrieked
and
died
then
silence
talley
the
looked
sick
then
he
said
correction
it
been
five
pushpots
exploded
and
five
pilots
killed
this
week
it
getting
a
little
bit
serious
he
looked
sharply
at
joe
better
drink
your
coffee
before
you
go
look
you
wo
want
to
afterward
he
was
right
joe
saw
the
crashed
pushpot
half
an
hour
later
he
found
that
his
ostensible
assignment
to
the
airfield
for
the
investigation
of
sabotage
was
quaintly
taken
at
face
value
there
a
young
lieutenant
solemnly
escorted
him
to
the
spot
where
the
pushpot
had
landed
only
ten
feet
from
a
hangar
wall
the
impact
had
carried
parts
of
the
pushpot
five
feet
into
the
soil
and
the
splash
effect
had
caved
in
the
hangar
there
been
a
fire
which
had
been
put
out
the
ungainly
flying
thing
was
twisted
and
torn
entrails
of
steel
tubing
were
revealed
the
plastic
cockpit
cover
was
shattered
there
were
only
grisly
stains
where
the
pilot
had
been
the
motor
had
exploded
the
jet
motor
and
jet
motors
do
not
explode
but
this
one
had
it
had
burst
from
within
and
the
turbine
vanes
of
the
compressor
section
were
revealed
twisted
intolerably
where
the
barrel
of
the
motor
was
ripped
away
the
jagged
edges
of
the
tear
testified
to
the
violence
of
the
internal
explosion
joe
looked
wise
and
felt
ill
the
young
lieutenant
very
politely
looked
away
as
joe
face
showed
how
he
felt
but
of
course
there
were
the
orders
that
said
he
was
a
sabotage
expert
and
joe
felt
angrily
that
he
was
sailing
under
false
colors
he
did
know
anything
about
sabotage
he
believed
that
he
was
probably
the
least
qualified
of
anybody
that
security
had
ever
empowered
to
look
into
methods
of
destruction
yet
in
a
sense
that
very
fact
was
an
advantage
a
man
may
be
set
to
work
to
contrive
methods
of
sabotage
another
man
may
be
trained
to
counter
him
the
training
of
the
second
man
is
essentially
a
study
of
how
the
first
man
mind
works
then
it
can
be
guessed
what
this
saboteur
will
think
and
do
but
such
a
trained
security
man
will
often
be
badly
handicapped
if
he
comes
upon
the
sabotage
methods
of
a
second
man
an
entirely
different
saboteur
who
thinks
in
a
new
fashion
the
security
man
may
be
hampered
in
dealing
with
the
second
man
sabotage
just
because
he
knows
too
much
about
the
thinking
of
the
first
joe
went
off
and
scowled
at
a
wall
while
the
young
lieutenant
waited
hopefully
nearby
he
was
in
a
false
position
but
he
could
see
that
there
was
something
odd
here
there
was
a
sort
of
pattern
in
the
way
the
other
sabotage
incidents
had
been
planned
it
was
hard
to
pick
out
but
it
was
there
joe
thought
of
the
trick
of
a
plane
during
its
major
overhaul
and
then
arming
the
traps
at
a
later
date
a
private
plane
had
been
fitted
to
deliver
proximity
rockets
in
when
the
transport
ship
flew
past
there
was
the
explosion
of
the
cargo
parcel
which
was
supposed
to
contain
requisition
forms
and
stationery
and
the
attempt
to
smash
the
entire
platform
by
getting
an
atomic
bomb
into
a
plane
and
having
a
saboteur
shoot
the
crew
and
then
deliver
the
bomb
at
the
shed
in
an
officially
harmless
aircraft
the
common
element
in
all
those
sabotage
tricks
was
actually
clear
enough
but
joe
was
used
to
thinking
in
such
terms
he
did
know
though
that
there
was
a
pattern
in
those
devices
which
did
not
exist
in
the
blowing
up
of
jet
motors
from
inside
he
scowled
and
scowled
racking
his
brains
while
the
young
lieutenant
watched
respectfully
waiting
for
joe
to
have
an
inspiration
had
joe
known
it
the
lieutenant
was
deeply
impressed
by
his
attempt
at
concentration
on
the
problem
it
had
not
been
major
holt
intention
for
joe
to
consider
when
joe
temporarily
gave
up
the
young
lieutenant
eagerly
showed
him
over
the
whole
field
and
all
its
workings
in
another
pushpot
fell
screaming
from
the
skies
that
made
six
pushpots
and
six
pilots
for
this
week
two
today
the
things
had
no
wings
they
had
no
gliding
angle
pointed
up
they
could
climb
unbelievably
while
their
engines
functioned
they
could
be
controlled
after
a
fashion
but
they
were
not
aircraft
in
any
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
they
were
engines
with
fuel
tanks
and
controls
in
their
exhaust
blast
when
their
engines
failed
they
were
so
much
junk
falling
out
of
the
sky
joe
happened
to
see
the
second
crash
and
he
did
go
to
noon
mess
at
all
he
had
any
appetite
instead
he
gloomily
let
himself
be
packed
full
of
irrelevant
information
by
the
young
lieutenant
who
considered
that
since
joe
had
been
sent
by
security
to
look
into
sabotage
he
must
be
given
every
possible
opportunity
to
evaluate
that
would
be
the
word
the
young
lieutenant
would
use
the
situation
but
all
the
time
that
joe
followed
him
about
his
mind
fumbled
with
a
hunch
the
idea
was
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
thinking
in
sabotage
and
if
you
could
solve
it
you
could
outguess
the
saboteur
but
the
trouble
was
to
figure
out
the
similarity
he
felt
existed
in
say
a
private
plane
shooting
rockets
and
overhaul
mechanics
planting
booby
traps
and
faked
shippers
getting
bombs
on
planes
and
come
to
think
of
it
there
was
braun
braun
was
the
key
braun
had
been
an
honest
man
with
an
honest
loyalty
to
the
united
states
which
had
given
him
refuge
but
he
had
been
blackmailed
into
accepting
a
container
of
atomic
death
to
be
released
in
the
shed
radioactive
cobalt
did
not
belong
in
the
shed
that
was
the
key
to
the
pattern
of
sabotage
braun
was
not
to
use
any
natural
thing
that
belonged
in
the
shed
he
was
to
be
only
the
means
by
which
something
extraneous
and
deadly
was
to
have
been
introduced
that
was
it
somebody
was
devising
ingenious
ways
to
get
destructive
devices
into
places
where
they
did
not
belong
but
where
they
would
be
effective
rockets
bombs
even
radioactive
cobalt
dust
all
were
perfectly
means
of
destruction
the
minds
that
planned
those
tricks
said
in
effect
these
things
will
destroy
how
can
we
get
them
to
where
they
will
destroy
something
it
was
a
strict
pattern
but
the
pushpot
sabotage
and
joe
was
sure
it
was
nothing
else
was
not
that
sort
of
thing
making
motors
explode
motors
do
explode
one
could
put
bombs
in
them
there
was
room
the
explosions
joe
had
seen
looked
as
if
they
centered
in
the
fire
basket
technically
the
combustion
area
behind
the
compressor
and
before
the
drive
vanes
a
jet
motor
whirled
its
front
vanes
compressed
air
and
a
flame
burned
furiously
in
the
compressed
air
which
swelled
enormously
and
poured
out
past
other
vanes
that
took
power
from
it
to
drive
the
compressor
the
excess
of
blast
poured
out
astern
in
a
flame
driving
the
ship
but
one
could
put
a
bomb
in
a
fire
basket
the
temperature
would
melt
anything
but
the
refractory
alloys
of
which
a
jet
motor
has
to
be
built
a
bomb
placed
there
would
explode
the
instant
a
motor
was
started
it
could
resist
until
the
pushpot
took
off
it
could
this
was
a
different
kind
of
sabotage
there
was
a
different
mind
at
work
in
the
afternoon
joe
watched
the
landings
while
the
young
lieutenant
followed
him
patiently
about
a
pushpot
landing
was
quite
unlike
the
landing
of
any
other
thing
it
came
flying
down
with
incredible
clumsiness
making
an
uproar
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
landing
speed
pushpots
came
in
with
their
tail
ends
low
crudely
and
cruelly
clumsy
in
their
handling
they
had
no
wings
or
fins
they
had
to
be
balanced
by
their
jet
blasts
they
had
to
be
steered
the
same
way
when
a
jet
motor
conked
out
there
was
no
control
the
pushpot
fell
he
carefully
watched
one
landing
now
it
came
down
low
and
swung
in
toward
the
field
and
seemed
to
reach
its
stern
down
tentatively
to
slide
on
the
earth
and
the
flame
of
its
exhaust
scorched
the
field
and
it
hesitated
pointing
up
at
an
ever
steeper
angle
and
it
touched
and
its
nose
tilted
forward
and
leaped
up
as
the
jet
roared
more
loudly
and
then
touched
again
the
goal
was
for
pushpots
to
touch
ground
finally
with
the
whole
weight
of
the
flying
monstrosity
supported
by
the
vertical
thrust
of
the
jet
and
while
it
was
moving
forward
at
the
lowest
possible
rate
of
speed
when
that
goal
was
achieved
they
flopped
solidly
flat
slid
a
few
feet
on
their
metal
bellies
and
lay
still
some
hit
hard
and
tried
to
dig
into
the
earth
with
their
blunt
noses
joe
finally
saw
one
touch
with
no
forward
speed
at
all
it
seemed
to
try
to
settle
down
vertically
as
a
rocket
takes
off
that
one
fell
over
backward
and
wallowed
with
its
belly
plates
in
the
air
before
it
rolled
over
on
its
side
and
rocked
there
the
last
of
a
flight
touched
down
and
flopped
and
the
memory
of
the
wreckage
had
been
overlaid
by
these
other
sights
and
joe
could
think
of
his
next
meal
without
aversion
when
it
was
time
he
went
doggedly
back
to
the
mess
hall
there
was
a
sort
of
itchy
feeling
in
his
mind
he
knew
something
he
did
know
he
knew
there
was
something
in
his
memory
that
he
could
recall
talley
and
walton
were
again
at
mess
joe
went
to
their
table
talley
looked
at
him
inquiringly
yes
i
saw
both
crashes
said
joe
gloomily
and
i
did
want
any
lunch
it
was
sabotage
though
only
it
was
different
in
kind
it
was
different
in
principle
from
the
other
tricks
but
i
ca
figure
out
what
it
is
mmmmmm
said
talley
amiably
you
learn
something
if
you
could
talk
to
the
resistance
fighters
and
saboteurs
in
europe
the
poles
were
wonderful
at
it
they
had
one
chap
who
could
get
at
the
tank
cars
that
took
aviation
gasoline
from
the
refinery
to
the
various
nazi
airfields
he
used
to
dump
some
chemical
compound
just
a
tiny
bit
into
each
carload
of
gas
it
looked
all
right
smelled
all
right
and
worked
all
right
but
at
odd
moments
hitler
planes
would
crash
the
valves
would
stick
and
the
engine
conk
out
joe
stared
at
him
and
it
was
just
as
simple
as
that
he
saw
the
nazis
lost
a
lot
of
planes
that
way
said
talley
those
that
did
crash
from
stuck
valves
in
flight
they
had
to
have
their
valves
reground
lost
flying
time
wonderful
and
when
the
nazis
did
uncover
the
trick
they
had
to
every
drop
of
aviation
gas
they
had
joe
said
that
it
that
it
and
is
what
then
joe
said
disgustedly
surely
it
the
trick
of
loading
bottles
with
explosive
gas
too
excuse
me
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
hurried
out
he
found
a
phone
booth
and
got
the
shed
and
then
the
security
office
and
at
long
last
major
holt
the
major
tone
was
curt
yes
joe
the
three
men
from
the
affair
of
the
lake
were
tracked
this
morning
when
they
were
cornered
they
tried
to
fight
i
am
afraid
we
get
no
information
from
them
if
that
what
you
wanted
to
know
the
major
manner
seemed
to
disapprove
of
joe
as
expressing
curiosity
his
words
meant
of
course
that
the
three
murderers
had
been
fatally
shot
joe
said
carefully
that
was
what
i
called
about
sir
i
think
found
out
something
about
the
pushpots
how
they
made
to
crash
but
my
hunch
needs
to
be
checked
the
major
said
briefly
tell
me
joe
said
all
the
tricks
but
one
that
were
used
on
the
plane
i
came
on
were
the
same
kind
of
trick
they
were
all
arrangements
for
getting
regular
destructive
items
bombs
or
rockets
or
whatever
where
they
could
explode
and
smash
things
the
saboteurs
were
adding
destructive
items
to
various
states
of
things
but
there
was
one
trick
that
was
different
yes
said
the
major
on
the
telephone
putting
explosive
gas
in
the
bottles
said
joe
painstakingly
was
adding
a
new
gadget
to
a
situation
it
was
changing
something
that
was
already
there
the
saboteurs
took
something
that
belonged
in
a
plane
and
changed
it
they
did
not
put
something
new
into
a
plane
or
a
situation
that
did
belong
there
it
was
a
special
kind
of
thinking
you
see
sir
the
major
to
do
him
justice
had
the
gift
of
listening
he
waited
the
pushpots
said
joe
very
carefully
naturally
have
their
fuel
stored
in
different
tanks
in
different
places
as
airplanes
do
the
pilots
switch
on
one
tank
or
another
just
like
plane
pilots
in
the
underground
storage
and
fueling
pits
where
all
the
fuel
for
the
pushpots
is
kept
in
bulk
there
are
different
tanks
too
naturally
at
the
fuel
pump
the
attendant
can
draw
on
any
of
those
underground
tanks
he
chooses
the
major
said
curtly
obviously
what
of
it
the
pushpot
motors
explode
said
joe
and
they
should
no
bomb
could
be
gotten
into
them
without
going
off
the
instant
they
started
and
they
do
blow
that
way
i
make
a
guess
sir
that
one
of
the
underground
storage
tanks
just
one
contains
doctored
fuel
guessing
that
as
separate
tanks
in
a
pushpot
are
filled
up
one
by
one
is
filled
from
a
particular
underground
storage
tank
that
contains
doctored
fuel
the
rest
will
have
normal
fuel
and
the
pushpot
is
going
to
crash
when
that
tank
and
only
that
tank
is
used
major
holt
was
very
silent
you
see
sir
said
joe
uneasily
the
pushpots
could
be
fueled
a
hundred
times
over
with
perfectly
good
fuel
and
then
one
tank
in
one
of
them
would
explode
when
drawn
on
there
be
no
pattern
in
the
explosions
major
holt
said
coldly
of
course
i
see
it
would
need
only
one
tank
of
doctored
fuel
to
be
delivered
to
the
airfield
and
it
need
not
be
used
for
weeks
and
there
would
be
no
trace
in
the
wreckage
after
the
fire
you
are
telling
me
there
is
one
underground
storage
tank
in
which
the
fuel
is
highly
explosive
it
is
plausible
i
will
have
it
checked
immediately
he
hung
up
and
joe
went
back
to
his
meal
he
felt
uneasy
there
could
be
any
way
to
make
a
jet
motor
explode
unless
you
fed
it
explosive
fuel
then
there
could
be
any
way
to
stop
it
and
then
after
the
wreck
had
burned
there
could
be
any
way
to
prove
it
was
really
sabotage
but
the
feeling
of
having
reported
only
a
guess
was
not
too
satisfying
joe
ate
gloomily
he
did
pay
much
attention
to
talley
he
had
that
dogged
uncomfortable
feeling
a
man
has
when
he
knows
he
does
qualify
as
an
expert
but
feels
that
he
hit
on
something
the
experts
have
missed
half
an
hour
after
the
evening
mess
near
sunset
a
security
officer
wearing
a
uniform
hunted
up
joe
at
the
airfield
major
holt
sent
me
over
to
bring
you
back
to
the
shed
he
said
politely
if
you
do
mind
said
joe
with
equal
politeness
i
check
that
he
went
to
the
phone
booth
in
the
barracks
he
got
major
holt
on
the
wire
and
major
holt
had
sent
anybody
to
get
him
so
joe
stayed
in
the
telephone
booth
on
orders
while
the
major
did
some
fast
telephoning
it
was
comforting
to
know
he
had
a
pistol
in
his
pocket
and
it
was
frustrating
not
to
be
allowed
to
try
to
capture
the
fake
security
officer
himself
the
idea
of
murdering
joe
had
not
been
given
up
and
he
have
liked
to
take
part
personally
in
protecting
himself
but
it
was
much
more
important
for
the
fake
security
man
to
be
captured
than
for
joe
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
attempting
it
himself
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
fake
officer
started
his
getaway
the
instant
joe
went
to
check
on
his
orders
the
officer
knew
they
be
found
faked
it
had
not
been
practical
for
him
to
shoot
joe
down
where
he
was
there
were
too
many
people
around
for
this
murderer
to
have
a
chance
at
a
getaway
but
he
did
get
away
at
that
twenty
minutes
later
while
joe
still
waited
fretfully
in
the
phone
booth
the
phone
bell
rang
and
major
holt
was
again
on
the
wire
and
this
time
joe
was
instructed
to
come
back
to
the
shed
he
had
exact
orders
whom
to
come
with
and
they
had
orders
which
identified
them
to
joe
some
eight
miles
from
the
airfield
it
was
just
dusk
joe
came
upon
a
wrecked
car
with
motorcycle
security
guards
working
on
it
they
stopped
joe
escort
joe
phone
call
had
set
off
an
alarm
a
plane
had
spotted
this
car
tearing
away
from
the
airfield
and
motorcyclists
were
guided
in
pursuit
by
the
plane
when
it
would
stop
when
the
fake
security
officer
in
it
tried
to
shoot
his
way
clear
the
plane
strafed
him
so
he
was
dead
and
his
car
was
a
wreck
and
the
motorcycle
men
were
trying
to
get
some
useful
information
from
his
body
and
the
car
joe
went
to
the
major
house
in
the
area
the
major
looked
even
more
tired
than
before
but
he
nodded
approvingly
at
joe
sally
was
there
too
and
she
regarded
joe
with
a
look
which
was
a
good
deal
warmer
than
her
father
you
did
very
well
said
the
major
detachedly
i
do
have
too
high
an
opinion
of
the
brains
of
anybody
your
age
joe
when
you
are
my
age
you
wo
either
but
whether
you
have
brains
or
simply
luck
you
are
turning
out
to
be
very
useful
joe
said
i
getting
security
conscious
sir
i
want
to
stay
alive
the
major
regarded
him
with
irony
i
was
thinking
of
the
fact
that
when
you
worked
out
the
matter
of
the
doctored
pushpot
fuel
you
did
not
try
to
be
a
hero
and
prove
it
yourself
you
referred
it
to
me
that
was
the
proper
procedure
you
could
have
been
killed
investigating
it
clear
that
the
saboteurs
would
be
pleased
to
have
a
good
chance
to
murder
you
and
your
suspicions
might
never
have
reached
me
they
were
correct
by
the
way
one
storage
tank
underground
was
of
doctored
fuel
rather
more
important
another
full
not
yet
drawn
on
the
major
went
on
without
apparent
cordiality
it
seems
probable
that
if
this
particular
sabotage
trick
had
not
been
detected
it
seems
likely
that
on
the
platform
all
or
most
of
the
pushpots
would
have
been
fueled
to
explode
at
some
time
after
the
platform
was
aloft
and
before
it
could
possibly
get
out
to
space
joe
felt
queer
the
major
was
telling
him
in
effect
that
he
might
have
kept
the
platform
from
crashing
on
it
was
a
good
but
upsetting
sensation
it
was
still
more
important
to
joe
that
the
platform
get
out
to
space
than
that
he
be
credited
with
saving
it
and
it
was
not
reassuring
to
hear
that
it
might
have
been
wrecked
your
reasoning
added
the
major
coldly
was
soundly
based
it
seems
certain
that
there
is
not
one
central
authority
directing
all
the
sabotage
against
the
platform
there
are
probably
several
sabotage
organizations
all
acting
independently
and
probably
hating
each
other
but
all
hating
the
platform
more
joe
blinked
he
had
thought
of
that
it
was
disheartening
it
will
really
be
bad
said
the
major
if
they
ever
yes
sir
said
joe
but
i
called
you
back
from
the
airfield
the
major
told
him
without
warmth
to
say
that
you
have
done
a
good
job
i
have
talked
to
washington
naturally
you
deserve
a
reward
i
doing
all
right
sir
said
joe
awkwardly
i
want
to
see
the
platform
go
up
and
stay
up
the
major
nodded
impatiently
naturally
but
ah
one
of
the
men
selected
and
trained
for
the
crew
of
the
platform
has
been
ah
taken
ill
in
strict
confidence
because
of
sabotage
it
has
been
determined
to
close
in
the
platform
and
get
it
aloft
at
the
earliest
possible
instant
even
if
its
interior
arrangements
are
incomplete
so
ah
in
view
of
your
usefulness
i
said
to
washington
that
i
believed
the
greatest
reward
you
could
be
offered
was
ah
to
be
trained
as
an
alternate
crew
member
to
take
this
place
if
he
does
not
recover
in
time
the
room
seemed
to
reel
around
joe
then
he
gulped
and
said
yes
sir
i
mean
that
right
i
mean
i
rather
have
that
than
all
the
money
in
the
world
very
well
the
major
turned
to
leave
the
room
you
stay
here
be
guarded
a
good
deal
more
closely
than
before
and
take
instructions
but
you
understand
that
you
are
still
only
an
alternate
for
a
crew
member
the
odds
are
definitely
against
your
going
that
that
all
right
sir
said
joe
unsteadily
that
quite
all
right
the
major
went
out
joe
stood
still
trying
to
realize
what
all
this
might
mean
to
him
then
sally
stirred
you
might
say
thanks
joe
her
eyes
were
shining
but
she
looked
proud
too
i
put
it
in
dad
head
that
that
was
what
you
like
better
than
anything
else
she
told
him
if
i
ca
go
up
in
the
platform
myself
and
i
ca
i
wanted
you
to
because
i
knew
you
wanted
to
she
smiled
at
him
as
he
tried
incoherently
to
talk
with
a
quiet
maternal
patience
she
led
him
out
on
the
porch
of
her
father
house
and
sat
there
and
listened
to
him
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
realized
that
she
was
humoring
him
then
he
stopped
short
and
looked
at
her
suspiciously
he
found
that
in
his
enthusiastic
gesticulations
he
had
been
gesticulating
with
hand
as
well
as
his
own
i
guess
i
pretty
crazy
he
said
ruefully
shooting
off
my
mouth
about
myself
up
there
in
space
you
pretty
decent
to
stand
me
the
way
i
am
sally
he
paused
then
he
said
humbly
i
plain
lucky
but
knowing
you
and
having
you
like
me
reasonably
much
is
pretty
lucky
too
she
looked
at
him
noncommittally
he
added
painfully
and
not
only
because
you
spoke
to
your
father
and
told
him
just
the
right
thing
either
you
sort
of
swell
sally
she
let
out
her
breath
then
she
grinned
at
him
that
the
difference
between
us
joe
she
told
him
to
me
what
you
just
said
is
the
most
important
thing
anybody
said
tonight
the
world
turned
over
on
its
axis
with
unfailing
regularity
and
nights
followed
mornings
and
mornings
followed
nights
according
to
precedent
one
man
turned
up
in
bootstrap
with
radiation
burns
but
he
had
not
offered
himself
for
check
over
at
the
hospital
he
was
found
dead
in
his
lodging
since
nobody
else
appeared
to
have
suffered
any
burns
at
all
it
was
assumed
that
he
was
the
messenger
who
had
brought
the
radioactive
cobalt
to
braun
who
also
had
been
doomed
by
possession
of
the
deadly
stuff
but
who
had
broken
the
chain
of
fatality
by
not
dumping
it
free
into
the
air
of
the
shed
under
the
circumstances
then
work
on
the
platform
was
resumed
and
three
times
in
each
hours
fleets
of
busses
rolled
out
of
bootstrap
carrying
men
to
work
in
the
shed
and
rolled
back
again
loaded
with
men
who
had
just
stopped
working
there
trucks
carried
materials
to
the
shed
and
doors
opened
in
the
great
dome
eastern
wall
and
the
trucks
went
in
and
unloaded
then
the
trucks
went
out
of
the
same
doors
and
trundled
back
for
more
materials
in
the
shed
shining
plates
of
metal
swung
aloft
and
welding
torches
glittered
in
the
maze
of
joists
and
upright
pipes
that
still
covered
the
monster
shape
each
day
it
was
a
little
more
nearly
complete
in
a
separate
guarded
workshop
by
a
sidewall
the
chief
and
haney
and
mike
the
midget
labored
mightily
to
accomplish
the
preposterous
they
grew
lean
and
from
fatigue
and
short
of
temper
and
ever
more
fanatical
and
security
men
moved
about
in
seeming
uselessness
but
vigilance
there
were
changes
though
the
assembly
line
of
pushpots
grew
shorter
and
the
remaining
monstrosities
around
the
sidewall
were
plainly
near
to
completion
there
came
a
day
indeed
when
only
five
ungainly
objects
remained
on
that
line
and
even
they
were
completely
plated
in
and
needed
only
a
finishing
touch
it
was
at
this
time
that
more
crates
and
parcels
arrived
from
the
kenmore
precision
tool
plant
and
joe
dropped
his
schoolroomlike
instruction
course
in
space
flight
for
work
of
greater
immediate
need
he
and
his
allies
worked
twice
around
the
clock
to
assemble
the
replaced
parts
with
the
repaired
elements
of
the
pilot
gyros
they
grew
groggy
from
the
desperate
need
both
for
speed
and
for
absolute
accuracy
but
they
put
the
complex
device
together
and
adjusted
it
and
surveyed
the
result
through
eyes
and
were
too
weary
to
rejoice
then
joe
threw
a
switch
and
the
reconstituted
pilot
gyro
assembly
began
to
hum
quietly
and
the
humming
rose
to
a
whine
and
the
whine
went
deliberately
up
the
scale
until
it
ceased
to
be
audible
at
all
presently
a
dial
announced
the
impossible
and
they
gazed
at
a
device
that
seemed
to
be
doing
nothing
whatever
the
gyros
appeared
quite
motionless
they
spun
with
such
incredible
precision
that
it
was
not
possible
to
detect
that
they
moved
a
hairbreadth
and
the
whole
complex
device
looked
very
simple
and
useless
but
the
four
of
them
gazed
at
it
now
that
it
worked
with
a
sudden
passionate
satisfaction
joe
moved
a
control
and
the
axis
of
the
device
moved
smoothly
to
a
new
place
and
stayed
there
he
moved
the
control
again
and
it
moved
to
another
position
and
stayed
there
and
to
another
and
another
and
another
then
the
chief
took
joe
place
and
under
his
hand
the
seemingly
static
disks
which
were
actually
spinning
at
forty
thousand
revolutions
per
minute
turned
obediently
and
without
any
appearance
of
the
spectacular
then
haney
worked
the
controls
and
mike
put
the
device
through
its
paces
mike
left
the
gyros
spinning
so
that
the
main
axis
pointed
at
the
sun
invisible
beyond
the
shed
roof
and
then
all
four
of
them
watched
it
took
minutes
for
this
last
small
test
to
show
its
results
but
visibly
and
inexorably
the
pilot
gyros
followed
the
unseen
sun
and
they
would
have
resisted
with
a
force
of
very
many
tons
any
attempt
to
move
them
aside
by
so
little
as
of
a
second
of
arc
which
would
mean
something
like
one
of
a
right
angle
and
these
pilot
gyros
would
control
the
main
gyros
with
just
this
precision
and
after
the
platform
was
out
in
space
could
hold
the
platform
itself
with
the
steadiness
needed
for
astronomical
observation
past
achievement
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
pilot
gyros
in
a
word
were
ready
for
installation
joe
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
were
not
beautiful
to
look
at
they
were
begrimed
from
head
to
toe
and
their
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
they
were
exhausted
to
the
point
where
they
did
not
even
notice
any
longer
that
they
were
weary
and
their
mental
processes
were
not
at
all
normal
so
that
they
were
quarrelsome
and
arbitrary
and
arrogant
to
the
men
with
the
trailer
who
came
almost
reverently
to
move
their
work
they
went
jealously
with
the
thing
they
had
rebuilt
and
they
were
rude
to
engineers
and
construction
workers
and
supervisors
and
they
shouted
angrily
at
each
other
as
it
was
hoisted
up
a
shaft
that
had
been
left
in
the
platform
for
its
entrance
and
they
were
very
far
from
tactful
as
they
watched
with
hot
anxious
eyes
as
it
was
bolted
into
place
it
would
be
welded
later
but
first
it
was
tried
out
and
it
moved
the
main
gyros
they
weighed
many
times
what
the
pilot
gyros
did
but
even
when
they
were
spinning
the
pilot
gyros
stirred
them
of
course
the
linkage
to
the
fabric
of
the
shed
had
to
be
broken
for
this
test
or
the
gyros
would
have
twisted
the
giant
upon
its
support
and
all
the
scaffolding
around
it
would
have
been
broken
and
the
men
on
it
killed
but
the
gyros
worked
they
visibly
and
unquestionably
worked
they
controlled
the
gigantic
wheels
that
would
steer
the
platform
in
its
and
later
would
swing
it
to
receive
the
cargo
rockets
coming
up
from
earth
the
pilot
instrument
worked
there
was
no
vibration
in
its
steering
apparatus
the
platform
was
ready
for
space
then
the
chief
yawned
and
his
eyes
glazed
as
he
stood
in
the
huge
gyro
room
and
haney
knees
wobbled
and
he
sat
down
and
was
instantly
asleep
then
joe
vaguely
saw
somebody
it
was
major
holt
holding
mike
in
his
arms
as
if
mike
were
a
baby
mike
would
have
resented
it
furiously
if
he
had
been
awake
and
then
suddenly
joe
did
know
what
was
going
on
around
him
either
there
was
a
definite
hiatus
in
his
consciousness
he
came
back
to
awareness
very
slowly
he
was
and
for
a
long
time
he
only
knew
contentedly
that
his
job
was
finished
then
slowly
he
realized
that
he
was
in
a
bunk
in
one
of
the
platform
sleeping
cabins
and
the
inflated
cover
that
was
sally
contribution
to
the
platform
held
him
very
gently
in
place
somehow
it
was
infinitely
soothing
and
he
had
an
extraordinary
sensation
of
peacefulness
and
relaxation
and
fulfillment
the
pilot
gyros
were
finished
and
in
position
his
responsibility
to
them
was
ended
and
he
had
slept
the
clock
around
three
times
he
slept
for
hours
he
was
starving
sally
had
evidently
constituted
herself
a
watch
over
joe
as
he
slept
because
she
faced
him
immediately
when
he
went
groggily
out
of
the
cabin
to
look
for
a
place
to
wash
he
was
still
covered
with
the
grime
of
past
labor
and
he
had
been
allowed
to
sleep
with
only
his
shoes
removed
he
was
not
an
attractive
sight
but
sally
regarded
him
with
an
approval
that
her
tone
belied
you
can
get
a
shower
she
told
him
firmly
and
then
i
have
some
breakfast
for
you
fresh
clothes
are
waiting
too
joe
said
peacefully
the
gyros
are
finished
and
they
work
do
i
know
demanded
sally
go
get
washed
and
come
back
for
breakfast
the
chief
and
haney
and
mike
are
already
awake
and
because
of
the
four
of
you
they
been
able
to
advance
the
platform
time
to
just
two
days
off
it
leaked
out
and
now
it
official
and
you
made
it
possible
this
was
a
slight
exaggeration
but
it
was
pardonable
because
of
partiality
for
joe
he
went
groggily
into
the
special
shower
arrangement
in
the
platform
in
orbit
there
would
be
no
gravity
so
a
tub
bath
was
unthinkable
the
shower
cabinet
was
a
cubbyhole
with
handgrips
on
all
four
sides
and
straps
into
which
one
could
slip
his
feet
when
joe
turned
handles
needle
sprays
sprang
at
him
from
all
sides
and
simultaneously
a
ventilator
fan
began
to
run
when
in
space
that
fan
could
draw
out
what
would
otherwise
become
an
inchoate
mixture
of
air
and
quite
weightless
in
space
a
man
might
drown
in
his
own
shower
bath
without
the
fan
the
apparatus
for
collecting
the
water
again
was
complex
but
joe
did
think
about
that
at
the
moment
he
considered
ruefully
that
however
convenient
this
system
might
be
out
in
the
platform
orbit
it
left
something
to
be
desired
on
earth
but
there
were
clean
clothes
waiting
when
he
came
out
he
dressed
and
felt
brand
new
and
utterly
peaceful
and
rested
and
it
seemed
to
him
very
much
like
the
way
he
had
often
felt
on
a
new
spring
morning
it
was
very
very
good
then
he
smelled
coffee
and
became
ravenous
there
were
the
others
in
the
platform
kitchen
sitting
in
the
chairs
that
had
straps
on
them
so
the
crew
need
float
about
because
of
weightlessness
there
was
an
argument
in
progress
the
chief
grinned
at
joe
mike
the
midget
looked
absorbed
haney
was
thinking
something
out
rather
painfully
sally
was
busy
at
the
platform
very
special
stove
she
had
ham
and
eggs
and
pancakes
ready
for
joe
to
eat
gentlemen
she
said
you
are
about
to
eat
the
first
meal
ever
cooked
in
a
space
ship
and
like
it
she
served
them
and
sat
companionably
down
with
them
all
but
her
eyes
were
very
warm
when
she
looked
at
joe
leavin
aside
what
we
were
arguin
about
said
the
chief
blissfully
sally
here
mind
if
i
call
you
sally
she
says
the
guys
have
given
our
job
the
works
and
they
say
it
a
better
job
than
they
designed
take
a
bow
joe
sally
said
firmly
when
the
technical
journals
are
through
talking
about
the
job
you
did
you
all
four
be
famous
for
technique
and
improvements
on
standard
practices
which
said
the
chief
sarcastically
is
gon
na
make
us
feel
fine
when
we
back
to
welding
and
stuff
no
more
welding
sally
told
him
not
on
this
job
the
closed
in
they
started
to
take
down
the
scaffolding
the
chief
looked
startled
haney
asked
laying
off
men
yet
not
you
sally
assured
him
definitely
not
you
you
four
have
the
very
top
security
rating
there
is
i
think
you
the
only
four
people
in
the
world
my
father
is
sure
ca
be
reached
somehow
to
make
you
harm
the
platform
mike
said
abruptly
yeah
the
major
thought
he
had
headaches
before
now
he
really
got
mike
had
seemed
to
be
listening
he
acted
as
if
he
were
feverishly
absorbing
the
feel
of
being
inside
the
platform
not
as
a
workman
building
it
but
as
a
man
whose
proper
habitat
it
would
become
but
joe
suddenly
realized
that
his
comment
was
exact
there
been
plenty
of
sabotage
to
prevent
the
platform
from
reaching
completion
but
now
it
was
ready
to
take
off
in
two
days
if
it
was
to
be
stopped
it
would
have
to
be
stopped
within
hours
by
people
with
plenty
of
resources
who
for
their
own
evil
ends
needed
it
to
be
stopped
these
last
two
days
would
contain
the
most
desperate
most
completely
ruthless
attempts
at
destruction
that
could
possibly
be
made
and
major
holt
had
to
handle
them
but
the
four
at
table
five
with
sally
were
peculiarly
relaxed
the
matter
they
handled
had
been
conspicuous
perhaps
but
it
was
still
only
one
of
thousands
that
had
to
be
accomplished
before
the
platform
could
take
off
but
they
had
the
infinitely
restful
feeling
of
a
job
well
done
no
more
welding
said
haney
meditatively
and
our
job
on
the
gyros
finished
what
are
we
gon
na
do
the
chief
said
forcefully
me
i
gon
na
sweep
floors
or
something
but
i
sure
gon
na
stick
around
and
watch
the
joe
said
nothing
he
looked
at
sally
she
became
very
busy
making
certain
the
others
did
not
want
more
to
eat
after
a
long
time
joe
said
with
very
careful
casualness
come
to
think
of
it
i
was
getting
loaded
up
with
astrogation
theory
when
i
had
to
stop
and
pitch
in
on
the
gyros
how
that
sick
crew
member
sally
i
would
know
answered
sally
unconvincingly
have
some
more
coffee
joe
made
his
face
go
completely
expressionless
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
sally
had
said
that
his
chances
looked
bad
for
making
the
crew
of
the
platform
when
it
went
out
to
space
but
sally
had
ways
of
knowing
things
she
would
be
sure
to
keep
informed
on
a
matter
like
that
because
she
was
wearing
joe
ring
and
it
would
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
discouragement
to
keep
her
from
finding
out
good
news
to
tell
him
she
did
have
any
good
news
so
it
must
be
bad
joe
drank
his
coffee
trying
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
known
all
along
he
was
going
to
make
the
crew
he
started
late
to
learn
the
things
a
crew
member
ought
to
know
he
stopped
at
the
most
crucial
part
of
his
training
to
work
on
the
gyros
which
were
more
crucial
still
he
slept
a
day
and
a
half
the
platform
would
take
off
in
hours
he
tried
to
reason
carefully
that
it
was
common
sense
to
use
a
man
who
was
fully
trained
from
the
beginning
for
a
place
in
the
crew
rather
than
a
latecomer
like
himself
but
it
was
easy
to
take
mike
the
midget
said
suddenly
i
got
a
hunch
shoot
it
said
the
chief
amiably
i
got
a
hunch
i
know
what
kind
of
sabotage
will
be
tried
next
and
when
said
mike
the
others
looked
at
him
all
but
joe
who
stared
at
the
wall
there
has
been
one
set
of
guys
trying
to
smash
the
platform
said
mike
excitedly
there
been
four
or
five
joe
found
a
gang
sabotaging
the
pushpots
that
did
think
like
the
gang
that
blackmailed
braun
and
the
gang
that
tried
to
kill
us
up
at
red
canyon
may
be
another
there
could
be
others
fascists
and
commies
and
nationalists
and
crackpots
of
all
kinds
and
they
all
know
they
got
to
work
fast
even
if
they
have
to
help
each
other
get
it
haney
growled
i
buy
what
you
said
so
far
said
the
chief
sure
those
will
all
pile
in
everything
they
got
at
the
last
minute
they
even
pull
together
to
smash
the
platform
and
then
each
other
afterward
but
what
they
do
an
when
this
time
they
try
outright
violence
said
mike
coldly
instead
of
sneaking
they
try
something
really
rough
for
sneaking
one
as
good
as
another
but
for
really
rough
stuff
there
just
one
time
when
the
platform
has
got
plenty
of
guys
around
ready
to
fight
for
it
the
chief
whistled
softly
you
mean
time
which
one
the
first
one
possible
said
mike
briefly
after
every
shift
things
will
get
tighter
so
my
guess
is
the
next
shift
if
they
can
and
if
one
gang
starts
something
the
others
will
have
to
jump
right
in
you
see
that
made
sense
one
attempt
at
actual
violence
defeated
would
create
a
rigidity
of
defense
that
would
make
others
impossible
if
a
successful
attempt
at
violent
sabotage
was
to
be
made
the
efforts
of
all
groups
would
have
to
be
timed
to
the
first
or
abandoned
i
could
uh
set
up
a
sort
of
smoke
screen
said
mike
we
fake
we
going
to
smash
something
and
let
those
saboteurs
find
it
out
they
see
it
as
a
chance
to
do
their
stuff
with
us
to
run
interference
for
sally
does
your
father
trust
us
sally
nodded
he
does
talk
very
cordially
but
he
trusts
you
okay
said
mike
you
tell
him
private
that
i
setting
up
something
tricky
he
can
laugh
off
anything
his
security
guys
report
that
mixed
up
in
joe
see
that
he
gets
the
whole
picture
beforehand
but
he
ai
to
tell
anybody
not
that
something
is
getting
framed
up
right
i
ask
him
said
sally
he
is
pretty
desperate
he
sure
some
frantic
assault
on
the
platform
will
be
made
but
we
tip
him
in
plenty
of
time
said
mike
with
authority
in
time
for
him
to
play
along
but
not
for
a
leak
to
spoil
things
okay
i
make
the
bargain
sally
assured
him
if
it
can
be
made
mike
nodded
he
drained
his
coffee
cup
and
slipped
down
from
his
chair
come
on
chief
haney
he
led
them
out
of
the
room
joe
fiddled
with
his
spoon
a
moment
and
then
said
the
crewman
i
was
to
have
subbed
for
if
he
did
get
well
he
did
did
he
sally
answered
reluctantly
joe
said
measuredly
well
then
that
that
i
guess
it
will
be
all
right
for
me
to
stick
around
and
watch
the
sally
eyes
were
misty
of
course
it
will
joe
i
so
sorry
joe
grinned
but
even
to
himself
his
face
seemed
like
a
mask
into
each
life
some
rain
must
fall
let
go
out
and
see
what
been
accomplished
since
i
went
to
sleep
all
right
they
went
out
of
the
platform
together
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
floor
of
the
shed
it
was
plain
that
the
stage
had
been
set
for
stirring
events
the
top
five
or
six
levels
of
scaffolding
had
already
been
removed
and
more
of
the
girders
and
pipes
were
coming
down
in
bundles
on
lines
from
giraffelike
cranes
there
were
some
trucks
in
view
too
giants
of
the
kind
that
carry
concrete
through
city
streets
they
were
pouring
a
doughy
white
paste
into
huge
buckets
that
carried
it
aloft
where
it
vanished
into
the
mouths
of
tubes
that
seemed
to
replace
the
scaffolding
along
the
platform
sides
lining
the
rockets
said
sally
in
a
subdued
voice
joe
watched
he
knew
about
this
too
it
had
been
controversial
for
a
time
after
the
pushpots
and
their
jatos
had
served
as
the
first
two
stages
of
a
aggregation
the
platform
carried
rocket
fuel
as
the
third
stage
but
the
platform
was
a
highly
special
ballistic
problem
it
would
take
off
almost
horizontally
a
great
advantage
in
fueling
matters
this
was
practical
simply
because
the
platform
could
be
lifted
far
beyond
effective
air
resistance
and
already
have
considerable
speed
before
its
own
rockets
flared
moreover
it
was
not
a
space
ship
in
the
sense
of
needing
rockets
for
landing
purposes
it
would
land
not
ever
and
again
there
was
the
fact
that
men
would
be
riding
in
it
that
ruled
out
the
use
of
and
and
acceleration
it
had
to
make
use
of
a
long
period
of
relatively
slow
acceleration
rather
than
a
brief
terrific
surge
of
power
so
its
very
special
rockets
had
been
designed
as
the
answer
they
were
rockets
though
solid
fuels
had
been
long
abandoned
for
missiles
but
they
were
entirely
unlike
other
drives
the
pasty
white
compound
being
hauled
aloft
was
a
refractory
compound
with
which
the
rocket
tubes
would
be
lined
with
the
solid
fuel
filling
the
center
the
tubes
themselves
were
thin
steel
absurdly
thin
but
wound
with
wire
under
tension
to
provide
strength
against
bursting
like
rifle
cannon
when
the
fuel
was
fired
it
would
be
at
the
muzzle
end
of
the
rocket
tube
and
the
fuel
would
burn
forward
at
so
many
inches
per
second
the
refractory
lining
would
resist
the
rocket
blast
for
a
certain
time
and
then
crumble
away
crumbling
the
refractory
particles
would
be
hurled
astern
and
so
serve
as
reaction
mass
when
the
steel
outer
tubes
were
exposed
they
would
melt
and
be
additional
reaction
mass
in
effect
as
the
rocket
fuel
was
exhausted
the
tubes
that
contained
it
dissolved
into
their
own
blast
and
added
to
the
accelerating
thrust
even
as
they
diminished
the
amount
of
mass
to
be
accelerated
then
the
quantity
of
fuel
burned
could
diminish
the
tubes
could
grow
smaller
so
the
rate
of
speed
gain
would
remain
constant
under
the
highly
special
conditions
of
this
particular
occasion
there
was
a
notable
gain
in
efficiency
over
a
rocket
design
for
one
item
the
platform
would
certainly
have
no
use
for
fuel
pumps
and
fuel
tanks
once
it
was
in
its
orbit
in
this
way
it
would
have
them
their
equivalent
in
mass
would
have
been
used
to
gain
velocity
and
when
the
platform
finally
rode
in
space
it
would
have
expended
every
ounce
of
the
driving
apparatus
used
to
get
it
there
now
the
rocket
tubes
were
being
lined
and
loaded
the
time
to
was
growing
short
indeed
joe
watched
a
while
and
turned
away
he
felt
very
good
because
finished
his
job
and
lived
up
to
the
responsibility
he
had
but
he
felt
very
bad
because
he
had
an
outside
chance
to
be
one
of
the
first
men
ever
to
make
a
real
space
journey
and
now
it
was
gone
he
resent
the
decision
against
him
if
it
had
been
put
up
to
him
probably
have
made
the
same
hard
decision
himself
but
it
hurt
to
have
had
even
a
crazy
hope
taken
away
sally
said
trying
hard
to
interest
him
these
rockets
hold
an
awful
lot
of
fuel
joe
and
it
better
than
scientists
thought
a
chemical
fuel
could
ever
be
yes
said
joe
said
sally
urgently
it
fits
in
with
the
pushpots
having
pressurized
cockpits
rockets
like
that
could
be
used
on
the
ground
the
fumes
would
be
poisonous
but
joe
only
nodded
in
agreement
he
was
apathetic
he
was
uninterested
he
was
still
thinking
of
that
lost
trip
in
space
he
realized
that
sally
was
watching
his
face
joe
she
said
unhappily
i
wish
you
would
look
like
that
i
all
right
he
told
her
you
act
as
if
you
did
care
about
anything
she
protested
and
you
do
i
all
right
he
repeated
i
like
to
go
outside
somewhere
she
said
abruptly
but
after
what
happened
up
at
the
lake
i
must
would
you
like
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
shed
if
you
want
to
he
agreed
without
enthusiasm
he
followed
when
she
went
to
a
doorway
with
a
security
guard
beside
it
in
the
sidewall
she
flashed
her
pass
and
the
guard
let
them
through
they
began
to
walk
up
an
inclined
endless
curving
ramp
it
was
between
the
inner
and
outer
skins
of
the
shed
there
had
to
be
two
skins
because
the
shed
was
too
big
to
be
ventilated
properly
and
the
hot
desert
sunshine
on
one
side
would
have
made
weather
inside
there
have
been
a
motion
of
the
air
in
the
enclosed
space
and
minor
whirlwinds
and
there
could
even
be
miniature
thunderclouds
and
lightning
joe
remembered
reading
that
such
things
had
happened
in
a
shed
built
for
zeppelins
before
he
was
born
they
came
upon
an
open
gallery
and
there
was
a
security
man
looking
down
at
the
floor
and
the
platform
he
had
a
very
good
view
of
all
that
went
on
they
went
around
another
long
circuit
of
the
slanting
gallery
dimly
lighted
with
small
electric
bulbs
they
came
to
a
second
gallery
and
saw
the
platform
again
there
was
another
guard
here
they
were
halfway
up
the
globular
wall
now
and
were
visibly
suspended
over
emptiness
the
view
of
the
platform
was
impressive
there
were
an
astonishing
number
of
rocket
tubes
being
fastened
to
the
outside
of
that
huge
object
three
giant
cranes
working
together
hoisted
a
tube
to
the
last
remaining
level
of
scaffolding
and
men
swarmed
on
it
and
fastened
it
to
the
swelling
hull
as
soon
as
it
was
fast
other
men
hurried
into
it
with
the
white
pasty
stuff
to
line
it
from
end
to
end
the
tubes
would
nearly
hide
the
structure
they
were
designed
to
propel
but
all
be
burned
away
when
it
reached
its
destination
wonderful
is
it
asked
sally
hopefully
joe
looked
and
said
without
warmth
it
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
anybody
ever
even
tried
to
do
which
was
true
enough
but
the
zest
of
it
had
unreasonably
departed
for
joe
for
the
time
being
his
disappointment
was
new
halfway
around
again
sally
opened
a
door
and
joe
was
almost
surprised
out
of
his
lethargy
here
was
a
watching
post
on
the
outside
of
the
monstrous
there
were
two
guards
here
with
machine
guns
under
canvas
hoods
their
duties
were
tedious
but
necessary
they
watched
the
desert
from
this
height
it
stretched
out
for
miles
and
bootstrap
could
be
seen
as
a
series
of
white
specks
far
away
with
hills
behind
it
ultimately
sally
and
joe
came
to
the
very
top
of
the
shed
into
the
open
air
from
here
the
steep
plating
curved
down
and
away
in
every
direction
the
sunshine
was
savagely
bright
and
shining
but
there
was
a
breeze
and
here
there
was
a
considerable
expanse
fenced
in
almost
an
acre
it
seemed
there
were
small
buildings
with
innumerable
antennae
of
every
possible
shape
for
the
reception
of
every
conceivable
wave
length
there
were
three
radar
bowl
reflectors
turning
restlessly
to
scan
the
horizon
and
a
fourth
which
went
back
and
forth
revolving
to
scan
the
sky
itself
sally
told
joe
that
in
the
very
middle
where
there
was
a
shed
with
a
domelike
roof
which
metal
there
was
a
radar
that
could
spot
a
plane
within
three
feet
vertically
and
horizontally
at
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
with
greater
distances
in
proportion
there
were
guns
down
in
pits
so
their
muzzles
would
interfere
with
the
radar
there
were
enough
guns
to
defend
the
shed
against
anything
one
could
imagine
and
there
are
jet
planes
overhead
too
said
sally
dad
asked
to
have
them
reinforced
and
two
new
wings
of
jet
fighters
landed
yesterday
at
a
field
somewhere
over
yonder
there
are
plenty
of
guards
the
platform
was
guarded
as
no
object
in
all
history
had
ever
been
guarded
it
was
ironic
that
it
had
to
be
protected
so
because
it
was
actually
the
only
hope
of
escape
from
atomic
war
but
that
was
why
some
people
hated
the
platform
and
their
hatred
had
made
it
seem
obviously
an
item
of
national
defense
ironically
that
was
the
reason
the
money
had
been
provided
for
its
construction
but
the
greatest
irony
of
all
was
that
its
most
probable
immediate
usefulness
would
be
the
help
it
would
give
in
making
nuclear
experiments
that
were
safe
enough
to
make
on
earth
that
was
pure
irony
because
if
those
experiments
were
successful
they
should
mean
that
everybody
in
the
world
would
in
time
become
rich
beyond
envy
but
joe
could
react
to
the
fact
he
was
drained
and
empty
of
emotion
because
his
job
was
done
and
he
lost
a
very
flimsy
hope
to
be
one
of
the
platform
first
crew
he
did
really
feel
better
until
late
that
night
when
suddenly
he
realized
that
life
was
real
and
life
was
earnest
because
a
panting
man
was
trying
to
strangle
joe
with
his
bare
hands
joe
was
hampered
in
his
because
a
large
number
of
battling
figures
trampled
over
him
and
his
antagonist
together
they
were
underneath
the
platform
and
joe
expected
to
be
blown
to
bits
any
second
joe
sat
on
the
porch
of
major
holt
quarters
in
the
area
next
to
the
shed
it
was
about
and
dark
but
there
was
a
moon
and
joe
had
come
to
realize
that
his
personal
disappointment
was
only
his
personal
disappointment
and
that
he
had
any
right
to
make
a
nuisance
of
himself
about
it
therefore
he
did
talk
about
the
thing
nearest
in
his
mind
but
something
else
that
was
next
nearest
or
farther
away
still
yet
with
the
shed
filling
up
a
full
quarter
of
the
sky
and
a
gibbous
moon
from
the
horizon
it
was
not
natural
for
a
young
man
like
joe
to
speak
purely
of
earthly
things
it
come
he
said
yearningly
staring
at
the
moon
if
the
platform
gets
up
day
after
tomorrow
it
going
to
take
time
to
ferry
up
the
equipment
it
ought
to
have
but
still
somebody
ought
to
land
on
the
moon
before
too
long
he
added
absorbedly
once
the
platform
is
fully
equipped
it
wo
take
many
rocket
pay
loads
to
refill
a
ship
tanks
at
the
platform
before
it
can
head
on
out
mathematically
a
rocket
ship
that
could
leave
the
platform
with
full
fuel
tanks
should
have
fuel
to
reach
the
moon
and
land
on
it
and
take
off
again
and
return
to
the
platform
the
mathematical
fact
had
a
peculiar
nagging
flavor
when
a
dream
is
subjected
to
statistical
analysis
and
the
report
is
in
its
favor
a
dreamer
satisfaction
is
always
diluted
by
a
subconscious
feeling
that
the
report
is
only
part
of
the
dream
everybody
worries
a
little
when
a
cherished
dream
shows
a
likelihood
of
coming
true
some
people
take
firm
steps
to
stop
things
right
there
so
a
romantic
daydream
wo
be
spoiled
by
transmutation
into
prosaic
fact
but
joe
said
doggedly
twenty
ferry
trips
to
pile
up
fuel
and
the
ship
should
be
able
to
refuel
and
go
on
out
and
then
somebody
will
step
out
on
the
moon
he
was
disappointed
now
he
would
be
the
one
to
do
it
but
somebody
would
you
might
try
for
the
ferry
service
said
sally
uneasily
i
will
said
joe
grimly
but
i
wo
be
hoping
too
much
after
all
there
are
astronomers
and
physics
sharks
and
such
things
who
be
glad
to
learn
to
run
rockets
in
order
to
practice
their
specialties
out
of
atmosphere
sally
said
mournfully
i
ca
seem
to
say
anything
to
make
you
feel
better
but
you
do
said
joe
he
added
grandiloquently
but
for
your
unflagging
faith
in
me
i
would
not
have
the
courage
to
bear
the
burdens
of
everyday
life
she
stamped
her
foot
stop
it
all
right
but
he
said
quietly
you
are
a
good
kid
sally
you
know
it
not
too
bright
of
me
to
mourn
she
drew
a
deep
breath
that
better
now
i
want
there
was
a
gangling
figure
walking
down
the
concrete
path
between
the
trim
monotonous
cottages
that
were
officers
quarters
at
the
shed
joe
said
sharply
that
haney
what
he
doing
here
he
called
haney
haney
manner
took
on
purpose
he
came
across
the
grass
the
lawns
around
the
officers
quarters
contained
the
only
grass
in
twenty
miles
hiya
said
haney
uncomfortably
he
spoke
politely
to
sally
hiya
uh
you
want
to
get
in
on
the
party
joe
what
kind
the
party
mike
was
talkin
about
said
haney
he
set
it
up
he
wants
me
to
get
you
and
a
kinda
uh
undercover
to
major
holt
joe
stirred
sally
said
hospitably
sit
down
you
noticed
that
my
father
gave
you
full
security
clearance
so
you
can
go
anywhere
haney
perched
awkwardly
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
yeah
that
helped
with
the
party
it
how
i
got
here
as
far
as
that
goes
mike
on
top
of
the
world
shoot
it
said
joe
he
been
pretty
bitter
about
things
said
haney
carefully
he
been
sayin
that
little
guys
like
him
ought
to
be
the
spacemen
there
half
a
dozen
other
little
guys
been
working
on
the
platform
too
they
can
get
in
cracks
an
buck
rivets
an
so
on
useful
he
had
all
hopped
up
on
the
fact
that
the
platform
coulda
been
finished
months
ago
if
it
been
built
for
them
an
they
could
get
to
the
moon
an
back
while
guys
could
an
so
on
remember
i
remember
said
sally
they
all
been
beefin
about
it
explained
haney
people
know
how
they
feel
so
today
mike
went
and
talked
to
one
or
two
of
an
they
started
actin
mysterious
passin
messages
back
an
forth
an
so
on
little
guys
actin
important
security
guys
would
notice
much
take
a
guy
mike
size
serious
unless
you
know
him
then
the
same
as
anybody
else
so
the
security
guys
did
pay
any
attention
to
him
but
some
other
guys
did
some
special
other
guys
they
saw
those
little
fellas
actin
like
they
were
cookin
up
somethin
fancy
an
they
bit
bit
asked
sally
they
got
curious
so
mike
an
his
gang
got
confidential
an
going
to
have
help
sabotagin
the
platform
when
the
next
shift
changes
the
midgets
gettin
even
for
bein
laughed
at
see
they
pretending
their
plan
is
that
when
the
platform
sabotaged
not
smashed
but
just
messed
up
so
it
ca
take
off
the
big
brass
will
let
take
a
ferry
rocket
up
in
a
hurry
an
get
it
in
orbit
an
use
it
for
a
platform
until
the
big
platform
can
be
mended
an
sent
up
once
they
up
there
there
no
use
tryin
to
stop
the
big
platform
so
it
can
go
ahead
joe
said
dubiously
i
think
i
see
mike
and
his
gang
of
little
guys
are
bein
saps
on
purpose
if
anybody
goin
to
pull
some
fast
stuff
next
shift
change
that
the
time
everybody
got
to
last
chance
mike
and
his
gang
do
know
what
gon
na
happen
but
they
sure
know
when
they
invitin
the
real
saboteurs
to
make
fools
of
and
what
happen
joe
said
drily
the
logical
thing
would
be
to
feel
sorry
for
the
big
guys
who
think
they
smarter
than
mike
said
haney
deadly
serious
mike
story
is
there
half
a
dozen
rocket
tubes
already
loaded
they
goin
to
fire
those
rockets
between
shifts
the
platform
gets
shoved
off
its
base
an
maybe
dented
and
so
on
mike
gang
say
they
got
the
figures
to
prove
they
can
go
up
in
a
ferry
rocket
an
be
a
platform
and
the
big
brass
wo
have
any
choice
but
to
let
sally
said
i
do
think
they
know
how
the
big
brass
thinks
haney
and
joe
said
together
no
and
joe
added
mike
not
crazy
he
knows
better
but
it
a
good
story
for
somebody
who
does
know
mike
haney
said
in
indignation
i
came
out
here
to
ask
the
major
to
help
us
the
chief
gettin
a
gang
together
too
there
some
indians
of
his
tribe
that
work
here
we
can
count
on
them
for
plenty
of
rough
stuff
and
there
joe
and
me
the
point
is
that
mike
stunt
makes
it
certain
that
everything
busts
loose
at
a
time
we
can
know
in
advance
if
the
major
gives
us
a
free
hand
and
then
in
the
last
five
minutes
takes
his
own
measures
so
they
ca
leak
out
ahead
of
time
and
tip
off
the
gangs
we
want
to
get
we
oughta
knock
off
all
the
expert
saboteurs
who
know
the
weak
spots
in
the
platform
for
instance
those
who
know
that
thermite
in
the
gyros
would
mess
everything
up
all
over
again
joe
said
quietly
but
major
holt
has
to
be
told
well
in
advance
about
all
this
that
absolute
yeah
agreed
haney
but
also
he
has
got
to
keep
quiet
not
tell
anybody
else
there
been
too
many
leaks
already
about
too
many
things
you
know
that
joe
said
sally
see
if
you
can
get
your
father
to
come
here
and
talk
haney
right
not
in
his
office
right
here
sally
got
up
and
went
inside
the
house
she
came
back
with
an
uneasy
expression
on
her
face
he
coming
but
i
could
very
well
tell
him
what
was
wanted
and
i
not
sure
he
going
to
be
in
a
mood
to
listen
when
the
major
arrived
he
was
definitely
not
in
a
mood
to
listen
he
was
a
harried
man
and
he
was
keyed
up
to
the
limit
by
the
multiplied
strain
due
to
the
imminence
of
the
platform
he
came
back
to
his
house
from
a
grim
conference
on
exactly
the
subject
of
how
to
make
preparations
against
any
possible
sabotage
incidents
and
ran
into
a
proposal
to
stimulate
them
he
practically
exploded
even
if
provocation
should
be
given
to
saboteurs
to
lure
them
into
showing
their
hands
this
was
no
time
for
it
and
if
it
were
it
would
be
security
business
it
should
not
be
meddled
in
by
amateurs
joe
said
grimly
i
do
mean
to
be
disrespectful
sir
but
there
a
point
you
missed
it
is
thinkable
that
you
be
able
to
prevent
something
from
being
tried
at
a
time
the
saboteurs
pick
they
got
just
so
much
time
left
and
they
use
it
but
mike
plan
would
offer
them
a
diversion
under
cover
of
which
they
could
pull
their
own
stuff
and
besides
that
you
know
your
office
leaks
you
could
set
up
a
trick
like
this
through
security
methods
and
for
a
third
fact
this
is
the
one
sort
of
thing
no
saboteur
would
expect
from
your
security
organization
we
caught
the
saboteurs
at
the
pushpot
field
by
guessing
at
a
new
sort
of
thinking
for
sabotage
here
a
chance
to
catch
the
saboteurs
who
work
their
heads
off
in
the
next
hours
or
so
by
using
a
new
sort
of
thinking
for
security
major
holt
was
not
an
easy
man
to
get
along
with
at
any
time
and
this
was
the
worst
of
all
times
to
differ
with
him
but
he
did
think
straight
he
stared
furiously
at
joe
growing
crimson
with
anger
at
being
argued
with
but
after
he
had
stared
a
full
minute
the
angry
flush
went
slowly
away
then
he
nodded
abruptly
there
you
have
a
point
he
said
curtly
i
do
like
it
but
it
is
a
point
it
would
be
completely
the
reverse
of
anything
my
antagonists
could
possibly
expect
so
i
accept
the
suggestion
now
let
us
make
the
arrangements
he
settled
down
for
a
quick
comprehensive
detailed
plan
in
careful
consultation
with
haney
joe
worked
it
out
the
point
was
that
the
major
part
was
to
be
done
in
completely
unorthodox
fashion
he
would
take
measures
to
mesh
his
actions
with
those
of
mike
the
chief
haney
and
joe
each
action
the
major
took
and
each
order
he
gave
he
would
attend
to
personally
his
actions
would
be
restricted
to
the
last
five
minutes
or
less
before
time
his
orders
would
be
given
individually
to
individuals
and
under
no
circumstances
would
he
transmit
any
order
through
anybody
else
in
every
instance
his
order
would
be
devised
to
mean
nothing
intelligible
to
its
recipient
until
the
time
came
for
obedience
it
was
not
an
easy
scheme
for
the
major
to
bind
himself
to
it
ran
counter
to
every
principle
of
military
thinking
save
one
which
was
that
it
was
a
good
idea
to
outguess
the
enemy
at
the
end
he
said
detachedly
this
is
distinctly
irregular
it
is
as
irregular
as
anything
could
possibly
be
but
that
is
why
i
have
agreed
to
it
it
will
be
at
least
unexpected
coming
from
me
then
he
smiled
without
mirth
and
nodded
to
joe
and
to
haney
and
went
striding
away
down
the
concrete
walk
to
where
his
car
waited
haney
left
a
moment
later
to
carry
the
list
of
arrangements
to
the
chief
and
to
mike
and
joe
went
into
the
shed
to
do
his
part
there
was
little
difference
in
the
appearance
of
the
shed
by
night
in
the
daytime
there
were
long
rows
of
windows
in
the
roof
which
let
in
a
vague
dusky
inadequate
twilight
at
night
those
windows
were
shuttered
this
meant
that
the
shadows
were
a
little
sharper
and
the
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
a
trifle
more
abrupt
all
other
changes
that
joe
could
see
were
the
normal
ones
due
to
the
taking
down
of
scaffolding
and
the
fastening
up
of
rocket
tubes
it
was
clear
that
the
shape
of
the
platform
proper
would
be
obscure
when
all
its
rocket
tubes
were
fast
in
place
joe
went
to
look
at
the
last
pushpots
and
they
were
ready
to
be
taken
over
to
their
own
field
for
their
flight
test
before
use
there
were
extras
anyhow
beyond
the
number
needed
to
lift
the
platform
he
found
himself
considering
the
obvious
fact
that
after
the
platform
was
aloft
they
would
be
used
to
launch
the
ferry
rockets
too
then
he
moved
toward
the
center
of
the
shed
a
whole
level
of
scaffolding
came
apart
and
its
separate
elements
were
bundled
together
as
he
watched
slings
lowered
the
bundles
down
to
waiting
trucks
which
would
carry
them
elsewhere
there
were
mixing
trucks
still
pouring
out
their
white
paste
for
the
lining
of
the
rocket
tubes
and
their
product
went
up
and
vanished
into
the
gaping
mouths
of
the
giant
pipes
presently
joe
went
into
the
maze
of
piers
under
the
space
platform
itself
he
came
to
the
temporary
stairs
he
had
reason
to
remember
he
nodded
to
the
two
guards
there
i
want
to
take
another
look
at
that
gadget
we
installed
he
said
one
of
the
guards
said
major
holt
said
to
pass
you
any
time
he
ascended
and
went
along
the
curious
corridor
it
had
handgrips
on
the
walls
so
a
man
could
pull
himself
along
it
when
there
was
no
weight
and
went
to
the
engine
room
he
heard
voices
they
were
speaking
a
completely
unintelligible
language
he
tensed
then
the
chief
grinned
at
him
amiably
he
was
in
the
engine
room
and
with
him
were
no
fewer
than
eight
men
of
his
own
coppery
complexion
here
some
friends
of
mine
he
explained
and
joe
shook
hands
with
men
who
were
named
charley
spotted
dog
and
sam
fatbelly
and
luther
red
cow
and
other
exotic
things
the
chief
said
exuberantly
major
holt
told
the
guards
to
let
me
pass
in
some
indian
friends
so
i
took
my
gang
on
a
guided
tour
of
the
platform
none
of
had
ever
been
inside
before
and
i
heard
you
talking
indian
said
joe
you
gon
na
hear
some
more
said
the
chief
we
the
first
war
party
of
my
tribe
in
my
grandpa
woulda
thought
respectable
joe
found
it
difficult
to
restrain
a
smile
the
chief
took
him
off
to
one
side
fella
he
said
kindly
it
bothers
you
this
business
because
it
ai
organized
that
what
this
world
needs
joe
everything
figured
out
by
slide
rules
an
such
it
civilized
but
it
ai
human
what
everybody
oughta
be
is
a
connoisseur
of
chaos
like
me
quit
an
get
outside
and
pick
up
that
security
guy
the
major
was
gon
na
send
to
meet
you
he
gave
joe
an
amiable
shove
and
rejoined
his
fellow
mohawks
each
of
whom
joe
noticed
suddenly
had
somewhere
on
his
person
a
stillson
wrench
or
a
reasonable
facsimile
to
serve
as
a
substitute
tomahawk
they
grinned
at
him
as
he
departed
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
of
narrow
wooden
steps
there
was
a
third
security
man
he
greeted
joe
major
holt
told
me
to
pick
you
up
he
observed
joe
walked
to
one
side
with
him
major
holt
had
promised
to
send
a
man
to
meet
joe
at
this
place
with
orders
to
take
instructions
from
joe
joe
said
curtly
you
to
snag
as
many
security
men
as
you
can
place
them
more
or
less
out
of
sight
under
the
platform
here
and
tell
them
to
turn
off
their
and
wait
no
matter
what
happens
they
to
wait
right
here
until
they
needed
right
here
he
looked
harassedly
around
him
the
security
man
nodded
and
moved
casually
away
this
was
close
timing
something
made
joe
look
up
he
saw
the
catwalk
gallery
nearly
overhead
the
expected
guard
was
there
haney
though
was
with
him
there
was
nothing
else
in
sight
not
yet
but
haney
was
on
the
job
joe
saw
a
security
man
step
out
of
sight
in
the
scaffolding
he
saw
his
own
assigned
security
man
speak
to
another
who
wandered
casually
toward
the
platform
base
minutes
passed
only
joe
could
have
noticed
because
he
was
watching
for
it
there
were
eight
or
nine
security
men
posted
within
call
they
had
their
turned
off
and
would
be
subject
only
to
his
orders
if
an
emergency
arose
gongs
began
to
ring
all
around
the
edge
of
the
shed
they
set
up
a
horrendous
clanging
this
was
not
an
alarm
but
simply
the
notice
of
time
there
was
a
marked
change
in
the
noises
overhead
a
crane
pulled
back
hammerings
dwindled
and
stopped
there
were
the
sounds
of
pipes
combined
to
form
the
scaffolds
being
taken
apart
for
removal
a
of
pipe
touched
the
floor
and
stayed
there
the
motor
stopped
its
operator
stepped
down
to
the
floor
and
headed
for
the
exit
hoists
descended
and
men
moved
across
the
floor
other
men
scrambled
down
ladders
the
floor
became
dotted
with
figures
moving
toward
the
doors
through
which
men
went
out
to
get
on
the
busses
for
bootstrap
nothing
happened
more
long
minutes
passed
the
shift
brought
out
by
the
busses
was
going
through
the
process
in
the
incoming
screen
room
joe
knew
that
major
holt
had
within
the
past
five
minutes
gathered
together
a
bunch
of
armed
security
men
to
be
available
for
anything
that
might
turn
up
the
men
doing
the
normal
screening
were
shorthanded
in
consequence
the
floor
next
to
the
exits
became
crowded
but
the
central
area
of
the
floor
was
cleared
one
truck
was
stalled
at
the
truck
doors
its
driver
ground
the
starter
insistently
suddenly
there
was
a
yell
away
up
on
the
platform
then
there
was
a
shot
its
echoes
rang
horribly
in
the
resonant
interior
of
the
shed
joe
own
special
security
man
hurried
to
him
his
face
tense
what
about
that
hold
everything
said
joe
grimly
that
taken
care
of
it
was
that
was
mike
gang
miniature
humans
popping
out
of
hiding
to
offer
battle
with
missiles
carefully
prepared
beforehand
against
their
alleged
associates
in
sabotage
one
of
the
associates
had
drawn
a
gun
and
fired
but
mike
gang
had
help
out
of
small
air
locks
devised
to
make
the
platform
skin
accessible
to
its
crew
on
every
side
provided
they
wore
space
suits
men
appeared
the
security
man
under
his
shoulder
made
a
buzzing
sound
he
reached
for
it
forget
it
snapped
joe
that
not
for
you
you
got
your
orders
stay
here
there
was
a
sudden
growling
uproar
where
men
were
crowding
to
get
out
of
the
shed
thick
billowing
smoke
appeared
there
was
a
crashing
explosion
the
men
eddied
and
milled
crazily
the
motor
of
the
stalled
truck
caught
it
moved
toward
the
door
which
opened
swinging
up
and
high
two
trucks
came
roaring
in
they
raced
for
the
platform
and
as
they
raced
inside
their
camouflaged
loads
clattered
off
and
men
showed
instead
the
guards
by
the
doorway
began
to
shoot
that
what
we
got
to
stop
snapped
joe
he
began
to
run
his
pistol
out
there
was
suddenly
a
small
army
gathered
by
his
orders
which
materialized
in
the
dim
space
under
the
platform
it
raced
to
guard
against
this
evidently
invasion
the
harsh
tearing
rattle
of
a
machine
gun
sounded
from
somewhere
high
up
joe
knew
what
it
was
mike
whole
scheme
had
been
intended
to
force
all
sabotage
efforts
to
take
place
at
a
single
instant
part
of
the
preparation
was
authority
for
haney
to
drag
in
two
machine
guns
from
an
outer
and
mount
them
to
cover
the
interior
of
the
shed
when
the
general
attack
began
those
machine
guns
were
shooting
at
the
trucks
splinters
sprang
up
from
the
floor
then
abruptly
one
of
the
trucks
vanished
in
a
monstrous
actinic
flash
of
flame
and
a
roar
so
horrible
that
it
was
not
sound
but
pure
concussion
the
other
truck
keeled
over
and
crashed
from
the
blast
but
did
not
explode
men
jumped
from
it
there
must
have
been
screamed
orders
but
joe
could
hear
nothing
at
all
he
only
saw
men
waving
their
arms
and
others
seized
things
from
the
toppled
load
and
rushed
toward
him
and
he
began
to
shoot
as
he
ran
to
meet
them
now
belatedly
the
sirens
of
the
shed
screamed
their
alarm
and
choppy
yappings
set
up
as
the
siren
wails
rose
in
pitch
over
by
the
exit
pistols
cracked
something
fell
with
a
ghastly
crash
not
ten
feet
from
where
joe
ran
it
was
a
man
body
toppled
from
somewhere
high
up
on
the
structure
that
was
the
most
important
thing
in
all
the
world
a
barbaric
war
whoop
sounded
among
the
echoes
of
other
tumult
a
security
man
shot
and
one
of
the
running
figures
toppled
and
slid
his
burden
which
must
certainly
be
a
bomb
rolling
ridiculously
there
had
been
two
trucks
that
plunged
through
the
door
they
had
raced
for
the
spaces
under
the
platform
at
the
exact
time
when
the
floor
would
be
clear
because
all
work
had
stopped
under
the
platform
the
trucks
were
to
have
been
detonated
at
the
very
least
they
would
have
rent
and
torn
it
horribly
they
might
have
broken
its
back
and
surely
one
truck
should
have
made
it
but
there
should
not
have
been
machine
guns
ready
trained
to
shoot
now
the
load
of
desperate
men
from
the
overturned
survivor
scurried
for
the
platform
with
parts
of
its
cargo
if
they
could
fight
their
way
inside
the
platform
they
could
blast
its
hull
open
or
demolish
its
controls
or
shatter
its
air
pumps
and
its
gyros
and
turn
its
air
tanks
into
sieves
anything
that
could
be
damaged
would
delay
the
and
so
expose
the
platform
to
further
and
perhaps
more
successful
attack
there
were
more
pistol
shots
a
group
of
men
fought
their
way
out
of
the
incoming
screening
rooms
and
raced
for
the
center
of
the
shed
later
it
would
be
found
they
had
slabs
of
explosive
inside
their
garments
and
detonation
caps
to
set
them
off
somewhere
another
door
opened
and
security
men
came
out
with
flickering
pistols
major
holt
leading
them
he
had
started
out
to
fight
off
the
attack
but
he
was
bound
to
be
too
late
joe
followers
were
trying
to
take
care
of
that
the
scuttling
men
from
the
incoming
rooms
were
major
holt
first
prey
they
were
shot
as
they
ran
joe
stumbled
and
fell
and
he
heard
guns
crackling
as
he
scrambled
up
he
pitched
into
a
running
figure
that
snarled
as
joe
hit
him
and
then
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
this
was
under
the
platform
and
in
the
middle
of
confusion
many
times
confounded
joe
caught
a
wrist
that
held
a
gun
he
knew
his
assailant
had
a
bomb
slung
over
one
shoulder
and
right
now
had
one
hand
free
for
combat
joe
instinctively
tried
to
batter
his
enemy
with
his
own
pistol
instead
of
pushing
the
muzzle
against
the
man
body
and
pulling
the
trigger
he
struck
a
flailing
blow
and
his
hand
and
the
weapon
struck
a
metal
brace
the
blow
cut
his
knuckles
and
paralyzed
his
fingers
despairingly
he
felt
the
pistol
slipping
from
his
grasp
then
his
assailant
brought
up
his
knee
viciously
but
it
hit
joe
thigh
instead
of
his
groin
and
joe
flung
his
weight
furiously
forward
and
they
toppled
to
the
ground
together
there
was
fighting
all
around
him
the
machine
guns
rasped
again
there
was
a
burst
of
fire
the
panicked
men
by
the
exit
tried
to
surge
out
through
the
swinging
doors
but
the
tracers
marked
a
line
they
must
not
cross
they
checked
once
a
gun
flashed
so
close
by
joe
eyes
that
it
blinded
him
and
once
somebody
fell
over
both
himself
and
his
antagonist
who
writhed
like
an
eel
possessed
of
desperate
strength
past
belief
joe
could
really
know
only
his
private
part
in
the
struggle
down
in
the
murky
tangle
of
the
scaffold
base
but
there
was
fighting
up
on
the
platform
itself
a
savagely
grinning
mohawk
wrestled
furiously
with
a
man
on
one
of
the
rocket
tubes
an
incendiary
device
in
the
pocket
ignited
and
it
flamed
and
he
screamed
as
it
burned
its
way
out
of
his
garments
the
mohawk
flung
the
man
fiercely
clear
to
crash
horribly
on
the
floor
and
then
kicked
the
incendiary
off
it
fell
after
the
man
and
hit
and
burst
and
it
was
thermite
which
surrounded
itself
with
a
column
of
acrid
smoke
from
seared
wood
blocks
there
was
fighting
by
the
exit
doors
there
was
an
ululating
uproar
in
the
incoming
screening
room
and
a
war
whoop
from
the
top
of
the
platform
a
saboteur
tried
to
crawl
into
an
entrance
and
he
got
his
head
and
shoulders
in
but
a
indian
held
his
forehead
still
and
chopped
down
with
the
side
of
his
hand
on
that
neck
underneath
the
platform
was
panting
chaos
with
pistol
shots
and
struggles
everywhere
the
force
joe
had
gathered
fought
valiantly
but
four
invaders
got
to
the
foot
of
the
wooden
steps
where
there
were
two
guards
then
there
were
only
two
saboteurs
left
to
scramble
desperately
up
the
steps
over
the
dead
guards
bodies
and
head
toward
the
platform
door
but
the
chief
appeared
swinging
a
stillson
he
let
it
go
precisely
like
a
skillfully
flung
tomahawk
and
leaped
down
sixteen
steps
squarely
onto
the
body
of
the
other
man
a
gun
flashed
but
then
there
was
only
squirming
struggle
on
the
floor
mike
the
midget
inside
the
platform
found
one
bloodied
panting
sobbing
man
who
somehow
had
gotten
inside
and
mike
brought
down
a
spanner
from
a
ladder
step
and
swarmed
upon
his
victim
and
hit
him
again
and
then
stayed
on
guard
until
somebody
arrived
who
was
big
enough
to
carry
the
saboteur
away
and
all
this
while
joe
struggled
with
only
one
man
it
was
a
horrible
struggle
because
the
man
had
a
bomb
and
he
might
manage
to
set
it
off
or
it
might
go
off
of
itself
it
was
a
ghastly
struggle
because
the
man
had
the
strength
and
desperation
of
a
maniac
and
practiced
the
tactics
joe
pounded
the
hand
that
held
the
gun
upon
the
floor
and
it
hit
something
and
exploded
smokily
and
fell
clear
but
that
made
things
worse
while
struggling
to
kill
joe
with
the
revolver
his
antagonist
had
had
only
five
fingers
with
which
to
gouge
out
joe
eyes
or
tear
away
his
ears
or
rend
his
flesh
but
with
no
pistol
he
had
ten
and
he
fought
like
a
wild
beast
he
even
breathed
like
an
animal
he
began
to
pant
thick
guttural
pantings
that
had
the
quality
of
hellish
hate
and
then
there
was
a
surging
of
bodies
major
holt
reserve
was
arriving
very
late
in
the
center
of
the
shed
and
then
a
struggling
group
trampled
all
over
the
pair
who
squirmed
and
fought
on
the
ground
and
a
heavy
boot
jammed
down
joe
head
and
he
felt
teeth
sink
in
his
throat
they
dug
into
his
flesh
worrying
and
tearing
joe
used
his
knee
in
a
frenzy
of
revulsion
used
his
knee
as
the
other
man
had
tried
to
use
his
in
the
first
instant
of
battle
the
man
beneath
him
screamed
as
an
animal
would
scream
and
joe
jerked
his
bleeding
throat
free
in
hysterical
horror
he
pounded
his
antagonist
head
on
the
floor
until
the
man
went
limp
and
then
he
heard
a
grim
voice
saying
quit
it
or
you
get
your
head
blown
off
quit
it
and
joe
panted
it
about
time
you
guys
got
here
this
man
came
in
on
that
truck
watch
out
for
that
bomb
he
got
slung
on
him
the
incoming
shift
had
a
messy
job
to
do
it
was
accomplished
only
because
security
men
abruptly
took
over
the
work
of
gang
bosses
and
all
ordinary
labor
on
the
platform
was
put
aside
until
normal
operations
were
again
possible
even
that
would
not
have
been
feasible
but
for
the
the
security
men
wore
as
the
situation
was
sorted
out
it
was
explained
to
them
and
they
relayed
the
news
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
curiosity
of
those
who
worked
under
them
no
work
no
explanation
it
produced
immediate
and
satisfactory
all
around
there
had
been
four
separate
and
independent
attempts
to
wreck
the
platform
at
the
same
time
one
was
of
course
the
plan
of
those
sympathetic
characters
who
had
volunteered
to
help
mike
and
his
gang
win
the
status
of
spacemen
by
firing
the
platform
rockets
there
were
not
many
of
them
and
they
had
lost
heavily
they
had
thermite
bombs
to
destroy
the
platform
vitals
ultimately
the
survivors
talked
freely
if
morosely
and
that
was
that
there
had
been
a
particularly
ungifted
attempt
to
cause
panic
in
the
incoming
shift
in
the
rooms
where
its
members
were
screened
before
admission
to
work
somebody
had
tried
to
establish
complete
confusion
there
by
firing
revolver
shots
in
the
crowd
expecting
the
workers
to
break
through
to
the
floor
and
assigned
gentlemen
with
slabs
of
explosive
to
get
to
the
platform
with
them
the
gentlemen
with
the
explosives
had
run
into
major
holt
security
reserve
and
they
got
nowhere
the
creators
of
panic
with
revolver
shots
were
finally
rescued
from
their
and
more
or
less
scraped
up
from
the
floor
they
were
in
very
bad
shape
and
carted
off
to
be
patched
up
for
questioning
the
members
of
this
group
had
been
impractical
idealists
and
besides
some
of
them
had
lost
their
nerve
as
was
evidenced
by
the
discovery
of
abandoned
explosives
and
detonators
in
the
locker
room
and
men
room
of
the
shed
the
most
dangerous
attempt
was
of
course
that
perfectly
planned
and
assault
which
had
been
merely
carried
out
at
its
original
time
without
either
being
hastened
or
delayed
by
mike
activities
that
plan
had
been
beautifully
contrived
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
successful
but
for
the
bullets
from
the
gallery
and
the
fight
joe
followers
put
up
underneath
the
platform
the
exact
instant
when
the
whole
shed
would
be
most
nearly
empty
had
been
fixed
upon
and
three
separate
units
had
worked
in
perfect
timing
there
been
the
man
in
the
stalled
truck
he
delayed
his
exit
from
the
shed
to
the
precise
fraction
of
a
second
to
get
the
doors
open
at
the
perfect
instant
the
trucks
had
raced
in
at
the
exact
second
when
they
were
most
certain
to
get
underneath
the
platform
and
detonate
their
cargoes
there
been
a
perfect
diversion
planned
for
that
too
smoke
bombs
and
explosions
in
the
outgoing
screening
rooms
had
created
real
panic
and
but
for
joe
order
for
his
to
be
turned
off
would
have
drawn
every
security
man
on
duty
to
that
spot
mike
trick
then
had
brought
some
saboteurs
into
the
open
but
had
merely
happened
to
coincide
with
the
most
dangerous
and
coup
of
all
however
it
was
due
to
his
trick
that
the
platform
was
not
now
a
wreck
there
was
also
another
break
that
was
sheer
coincidence
it
was
a
discovery
that
could
not
possibly
have
turned
up
save
in
a
situation
of
pure
chaos
artificially
induced
joe
had
had
to
react
in
a
personal
and
vengeful
way
to
the
manner
in
which
his
especial
antagonist
had
fought
him
one
expects
a
man
to
fight
fair
by
instinct
and
to
turn
to
fouls
if
he
does
in
desperation
only
but
joe
personal
opponent
had
tried
a
single
fair
trick
it
was
as
if
he
never
heard
of
a
fist
blow
but
only
of
murder
and
mayhem
joe
felt
an
individual
enmity
toward
him
joe
did
consider
himself
the
most
urgent
of
the
injured
when
doctors
and
nurses
took
up
the
work
of
patching
but
sally
was
there
to
help
and
she
went
deathly
pale
when
she
saw
his
bloodstained
throat
she
dragged
him
quickly
to
a
doctor
and
the
doctor
looked
at
joe
and
dropped
everything
else
but
it
was
too
serious
the
antiseptics
hurt
and
the
stitching
was
unpleasant
but
joe
was
more
worried
by
the
knowledge
that
sally
was
standing
there
and
suffering
for
him
when
he
got
up
from
the
emergency
operating
table
the
doctor
nodded
grimly
to
him
that
was
close
said
the
doctor
whoever
chewed
you
was
working
for
your
jugular
vein
and
he
was
halfway
through
the
wall
when
he
stopped
a
fraction
of
an
inch
more
and
he
have
had
you
thanks
said
joe
his
neck
felt
clumsy
with
bandages
and
when
he
tried
to
turn
his
head
the
stitches
hurt
sally
hand
trembled
in
his
when
she
led
him
away
i
did
think
i
ever
dislike
anybody
so
much
said
joe
angrily
as
i
did
that
man
while
he
was
chewing
my
throat
we
were
trying
to
kill
each
other
of
course
but
confound
it
people
do
bite
did
you
kill
him
asked
sally
in
a
shaky
voice
not
that
i
mind
i
would
have
hated
the
thought
ordinarily
but
joe
halted
there
was
a
row
of
stretchers
not
too
long
at
that
in
the
space
he
looked
down
at
the
unconscious
man
fought
him
there
he
is
he
said
irritably
i
banged
him
pretty
hard
i
like
to
hate
anybody
but
the
way
he
fought
sally
teeth
chattered
suddenly
she
called
to
one
of
the
security
men
standing
guard
by
the
stretchers
i
think
my
father
is
going
to
want
to
talk
to
him
she
said
unsteadily
do
let
him
be
taken
away
to
the
hospital
until
dad
knows
please
she
started
away
her
face
and
her
hand
what
the
matter
demanded
joe
said
sally
in
an
indescribable
tone
that
had
a
suggestion
of
heartbreak
she
went
into
her
father
office
alone
she
came
out
again
with
him
and
her
father
looked
completely
stricken
miss
ross
his
secretary
was
with
him
too
her
face
was
like
a
mask
of
marble
she
had
always
been
a
plain
woman
a
gloomy
one
a
morbid
one
but
at
the
new
and
horrible
look
on
her
face
joe
turned
his
eyes
away
then
sally
was
crying
beside
him
and
he
put
his
arm
clumsily
around
her
and
let
her
sob
on
his
shoulder
completely
puzzled
he
did
find
out
until
later
what
the
trouble
was
the
man
who
tried
so
earnestly
to
kill
him
was
miss
ross
fiancé
she
had
met
this
man
during
a
vacation
as
a
government
secretary
and
he
was
a
refugee
with
an
exotic
charm
that
would
have
fascinated
a
much
more
personable
and
beautiful
woman
than
miss
ross
they
had
a
whirlwind
romance
he
confided
to
her
his
terror
of
emissaries
from
his
native
country
who
might
kill
him
and
of
course
she
was
more
fascinated
still
when
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
accepted
his
proposal
then
just
two
weeks
before
her
assignment
to
the
space
platform
project
he
vanished
miss
ross
was
desperate
and
lovesick
one
day
her
telephone
rang
and
his
anguished
voice
told
her
he
been
abducted
and
if
she
told
the
police
he
would
be
tortured
to
death
he
begged
her
not
to
do
anything
to
cause
him
more
torment
than
was
already
his
she
been
trying
to
keep
him
alive
ever
since
once
when
she
bring
herself
to
carry
out
an
order
she
been
given
with
threats
of
torment
to
him
if
she
failed
she
received
a
human
finger
in
the
mail
and
a
scrawled
and
note
which
cried
out
of
unspeakable
torment
and
begged
her
not
to
doom
him
to
more
so
miss
ross
who
was
major
holt
secretary
and
one
of
his
most
trusted
assistants
had
been
giving
information
to
one
group
of
saboteurs
all
the
while
she
was
the
most
dangerous
security
leak
in
the
whole
platform
project
but
her
fiancé
was
a
captive
he
was
the
head
of
that
group
of
saboteurs
he
made
love
to
her
and
proposed
to
her
merely
to
prepare
her
to
supply
the
information
he
wanted
he
needed
only
to
write
a
sufficiently
agonized
note
or
gasp
tormented
pleas
on
a
telephone
to
get
what
he
wanted
incidentally
he
still
had
all
his
fingers
when
joe
knocked
him
cold
sally
had
recognized
him
as
the
subject
of
a
snapshot
she
once
seen
miss
ross
crying
over
miss
ross
had
hidden
it
hastily
and
told
her
it
was
someone
she
had
once
loved
now
dead
and
this
inadvertent
disclosure
that
miss
ross
was
the
security
leak
the
major
had
never
had
a
clue
to
could
only
have
come
about
through
such
confusion
as
mike
had
instigated
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
joe
had
organized
but
joe
learned
those
facts
only
later
at
the
moment
there
was
still
the
platform
to
be
gotten
aloft
and
there
was
plenty
of
work
to
do
there
were
two
small
rips
in
the
plating
caused
by
fragments
of
the
exploded
truck
there
were
some
bullet
holes
the
platform
could
resist
small
meteorites
at
miles
a
second
but
a
projectile
could
puncture
it
those
scars
of
battle
had
to
be
welded
shut
the
rest
of
the
scaffolding
had
to
come
down
and
the
rest
of
the
rocket
tubes
had
to
be
affixed
and
there
was
cleaning
up
to
be
done
these
things
occupied
the
shift
that
came
on
at
the
time
of
the
multiple
sabotage
assaults
at
first
the
work
was
ragged
but
the
policy
of
turning
the
security
men
into
news
broadcasters
worked
well
after
all
the
platform
was
a
construction
job
and
the
men
who
worked
on
it
were
not
softies
most
of
them
had
seen
men
killed
before
before
the
shift
was
half
over
a
definite
work
rhythm
was
evident
men
had
begun
to
take
an
even
greater
pride
in
the
thing
they
had
built
because
it
had
been
assailed
and
not
destroyed
and
the
job
was
almost
over
sally
went
back
to
her
father
quarters
to
try
to
sleep
joe
stayed
in
the
shed
his
throat
was
painful
enough
so
that
he
did
want
to
go
to
bed
until
he
was
genuinely
tired
and
he
was
thoroughly
wrought
up
mike
the
midget
had
gone
peacefully
to
sleep
again
curled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
outgoing
screening
room
his
fellow
midgets
talked
satisfiedly
among
themselves
presently
to
show
their
superiority
to
mere
pitched
battles
two
of
them
brought
out
a
miniature
pack
of
cards
and
started
a
card
game
while
they
waited
for
a
bus
to
take
them
back
to
bootstrap
the
chief
indian
associates
loafed
comfortably
while
waiting
for
the
same
busses
later
they
would
put
in
for
overtime
and
get
it
haney
mourned
that
he
had
been
remote
from
the
scene
of
action
and
was
merely
responsible
for
the
presence
and
placing
and
firing
of
the
machine
guns
that
had
certainly
kept
the
platform
from
being
blown
up
from
below
it
seemed
that
nothing
else
would
happen
to
bother
anybody
but
there
was
one
thing
more
that
thing
happened
just
two
hours
before
it
was
time
for
the
shift
to
change
once
again
and
when
normal
work
was
back
in
progress
in
the
shed
everything
seemed
fully
organized
and
serene
everything
in
the
shed
had
settled
down
and
nothing
had
happened
outside
there
was
ample
exterior
protection
of
course
but
the
system
had
had
anything
to
do
for
a
very
long
time
men
at
radar
screens
were
bored
and
sleepy
from
sheer
inactivity
and
silence
pilots
in
jet
planes
two
miles
and
five
miles
and
eight
miles
high
had
long
since
grown
weary
of
the
splendid
view
below
them
after
all
one
can
get
very
used
to
late
slanting
moonlight
on
cloud
masses
far
underneath
and
bright
and
stars
overhead
so
the
thing
was
well
timed
a
canadian
station
noticed
the
pip
on
its
radar
screen
first
the
radar
observer
was
puzzled
by
it
it
could
have
been
a
meteor
and
the
canadian
observer
at
first
thought
it
was
but
it
was
going
quite
fast
enough
and
it
lasted
too
long
it
was
traveling
six
hundred
miles
an
hour
and
it
was
headed
due
south
at
sixty
thousand
feet
the
speed
could
have
been
within
reason
provided
it
did
stay
constant
but
it
did
there
was
something
traveling
south
at
eleven
miles
a
minute
or
better
a
mile
in
seconds
it
did
slow
it
did
drop
the
canadian
radarman
debated
painfully
he
stopped
his
companion
from
the
reading
of
a
magazine
article
about
chinchilla
breeding
in
the
home
he
showed
him
the
pip
still
headed
south
and
almost
at
the
limit
of
this
radar
instrument
range
they
discussed
the
thing
dubiously
they
decided
to
report
it
they
had
a
little
trouble
getting
the
call
through
the
night
operators
were
sleepy
because
of
the
difficulty
of
making
the
call
the
radarmen
became
obstinate
and
insisted
on
putting
it
through
they
reported
to
ottawa
that
some
object
flying
at
sixty
thousand
feet
and
six
hundred
miles
an
hour
was
crossing
canada
headed
for
the
united
states
there
was
a
further
time
loss
somebody
in
authority
had
to
be
awakened
and
somebody
had
to
decide
that
a
further
report
was
justified
then
the
trick
had
to
be
accomplished
and
a
sleepy
man
in
a
bathrobe
and
slippers
listened
and
said
sleepily
oh
of
course
you
tell
the
americans
it
only
neighborly
and
padded
back
to
his
bed
to
go
to
sleep
again
then
he
waked
up
suddenly
and
began
to
sweat
he
realized
that
this
might
be
the
beginning
of
atomic
war
so
he
set
phone
bells
to
jangling
furiously
all
over
canada
and
jet
planes
began
to
boom
in
the
darkness
but
there
was
only
one
object
in
the
sky
over
the
dakotas
it
went
higher
it
went
to
seventy
thousand
feet
and
then
eighty
how
this
was
managed
is
not
completely
known
because
there
are
still
some
details
of
that
flight
that
have
never
been
completely
explained
but
certainly
jatos
flared
briefly
at
some
point
and
the
object
reached
ninety
thousand
feet
where
a
jet
motor
would
certainly
be
useless
and
then
almost
certainly
rockets
flared
once
more
and
well
south
of
the
dakotas
it
started
down
in
a
trajectory
like
that
of
an
artillery
shell
but
with
considerably
higher
speed
than
most
artillery
shells
achieve
it
was
at
about
this
time
that
the
siren
in
the
shed
began
its
choppy
hiccoughing
series
of
notes
the
news
from
canada
arrived
as
a
matter
of
fact
some
thirty
seconds
after
the
radar
screen
around
the
platform
gave
its
warning
then
there
was
no
hesitation
or
delay
at
all
men
were
already
tumbling
out
of
bed
at
three
airfields
buckling
helmets
and
hoping
their
oxygen
tanks
would
function
properly
then
the
radars
atop
the
shed
itself
picked
up
the
moving
speck
and
small
flames
began
to
rise
from
the
ground
and
go
streaking
away
in
the
darkness
in
astonishing
numbers
the
covers
of
the
guns
at
the
top
of
the
shed
slid
aside
miles
away
jet
planes
shot
skyward
and
newly
wakened
pilots
looked
at
their
instruments
and
swore
unbelievingly
at
the
speed
they
were
told
the
plunging
object
was
making
the
jet
pilots
gave
their
motors
everything
they
could
take
but
it
did
look
good
the
planes
of
the
jet
umbrella
over
the
shed
stopped
cruising
and
sprinted
and
they
were
the
only
ones
likely
to
get
in
front
of
the
object
in
time
inside
the
shed
the
siren
howled
dismally
and
all
the
security
men
were
snapping
radar
alarm
all
out
radar
alarm
all
out
and
men
were
moving
fast
too
some
came
down
from
the
platform
on
hoists
dropping
with
reckless
speed
to
the
floor
level
some
wait
for
a
turn
at
that
they
slid
down
one
upright
swung
around
the
crosspiece
on
the
level
below
and
slid
down
another
vertical
pipe
for
a
minute
or
more
it
looked
as
if
the
scaffolds
oozed
black
droplets
which
slid
down
its
pipes
but
the
drops
were
men
the
floor
became
speckled
and
spotted
with
dots
running
for
its
exits
the
siren
ceased
its
wailing
and
its
noise
went
down
and
down
in
pitch
until
it
was
a
baritone
moan
that
dropped
to
bass
and
ceased
then
there
was
no
sound
but
the
men
moving
to
get
out
of
the
shed
there
were
trucks
too
those
that
had
been
loading
with
dismantled
scaffolding
roared
for
the
doors
to
get
out
and
away
some
men
jumped
on
board
as
they
passed
the
exit
doors
swung
up
to
let
them
go
but
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
shed
at
that
there
was
no
noise
but
a
few
fleeing
trucks
and
the
murmur
which
was
the
voices
of
the
security
men
hurrying
the
work
crew
out
there
was
less
to
hear
than
went
on
ordinarily
and
it
was
a
long
distance
across
the
floor
of
the
shed
joe
stood
with
his
fists
clenched
absurdly
this
could
only
be
an
air
attack
an
air
attack
could
only
mean
an
attack
and
if
there
was
an
atom
bomb
dropped
on
the
shed
there
be
no
use
getting
outside
it
would
be
merely
a
fission
bomb
it
would
be
a
hell
bomb
a
bomb
which
used
the
kind
of
bomb
that
shattered
hiroshima
only
as
a
primer
for
the
real
explosive
nobody
could
hope
to
get
beyond
the
radius
of
its
destruction
before
it
hit
joe
heard
himself
raging
he
thought
of
sally
she
be
in
the
range
of
annihilation
too
and
joe
knew
such
fury
and
hatred
because
of
sally
that
he
forgot
everything
else
he
did
run
he
could
escape
he
could
fight
back
but
because
he
hated
he
had
to
do
something
to
defy
he
found
himself
moving
toward
the
platform
his
jaws
clenched
it
was
pure
blind
instinctive
defiance
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
have
that
reaction
men
running
toward
the
sidewall
exits
began
to
get
out
of
breath
from
their
running
they
slowed
presently
they
stopped
they
scowled
and
raged
like
joe
some
of
them
looked
with
burning
eyes
up
at
the
roof
of
the
shed
though
their
thoughts
went
on
beyond
it
the
security
guards
repeated
radar
alarm
all
out
radar
alarm
all
out
someone
snarled
nuts
to
that
joe
saw
a
man
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
himself
he
was
walking
deliberately
back
to
the
platform
somebody
else
was
headed
back
too
very
peculiarly
almost
all
the
men
on
the
floor
had
ceased
to
run
they
began
to
gather
in
little
groups
they
knew
flight
was
useless
they
talked
briefly
profanely
here
and
there
men
started
disgustedly
back
toward
the
platform
their
lips
moved
in
expressions
of
furious
scorn
their
scorn
was
of
themselves
there
was
a
gathering
of
men
about
the
base
of
the
framework
that
still
partly
veiled
the
platform
they
tended
to
face
outward
angrily
and
to
clench
their
fists
then
somebody
started
an
engine
a
man
began
to
climb
furiously
back
to
where
he
had
been
at
work
quite
unreasonably
other
men
followed
him
hammers
began
defiantly
and
enragedly
to
sound
the
work
crew
in
the
shed
went
defiantly
and
furiously
back
to
work
a
clamor
was
set
up
that
was
almost
the
normal
working
noise
it
was
the
only
possible
way
in
which
those
men
could
express
the
raging
contempt
they
felt
for
those
who
would
destroy
the
thing
they
worked
on
but
there
were
some
other
men
who
could
do
more
there
were
three
levels
of
jet
planes
above
the
shed
and
they
could
dive
the
highest
one
got
first
to
the
line
along
which
the
missile
from
an
unknown
place
was
plunging
toward
the
shed
that
plane
steadied
on
a
collision
course
and
let
go
its
wing
load
of
rockets
it
peeled
off
and
got
out
of
the
way
seconds
later
the
others
from
the
jet
umbrella
were
arriving
a
tiny
spray
of
rockets
blazed
furiously
toward
the
invisible
thing
from
the
heights
other
planes
and
yet
others
came
hurtling
to
the
line
their
radars
briskly
computed
for
them
there
were
more
rockets
the
thing
with
more
than
the
speed
of
an
artillery
shell
plunged
into
a
miniature
hail
of
rockets
they
flamed
viciously
half
a
dozen
a
dozen
explosions
that
were
pure
futility
then
there
was
an
explosion
that
was
not
nobody
saw
it
because
its
puny
detonation
was
instantly
wiped
out
in
a
blaze
of
such
incredible
incandescence
that
the
aluminum
paint
on
jet
planes
still
miles
away
was
scorched
and
blistered
instantly
the
light
of
that
flare
was
seen
for
hundreds
of
miles
the
sound
later
on
was
heard
farther
still
and
the
desert
vegetation
miles
below
the
hell
bomb
showed
signs
of
searing
when
the
morning
came
but
the
thing
from
the
north
was
vaporized
utterly
some
miles
from
its
target
the
damage
it
did
was
negligible
the
work
on
the
preparation
for
the
platform
went
on
when
the
signal
sounded
inside
the
shed
nobody
paid
any
attention
they
were
too
busy
on
the
day
of
the
there
were
a
number
of
curious
from
the
completion
of
the
space
platform
there
was
a
very
small
country
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
which
determined
desperately
to
risk
its
existence
on
the
success
of
the
platform
flight
it
had
to
choose
between
abject
submission
to
a
powerful
neighbor
or
the
possibility
of
a
revolution
in
which
its
neighbor
troops
would
take
on
the
semblance
of
citizens
for
purposes
if
the
platform
got
aloft
it
could
defy
its
neighbor
and
in
a
grim
gamble
it
did
there
was
also
a
fight
in
the
united
nations
wherein
the
platform
was
denounced
and
a
certain
block
of
associated
countries
issued
an
ultimatum
threatening
to
bolt
the
international
organization
if
the
platform
went
aloft
and
again
there
had
to
be
a
grim
gamble
if
the
platform
did
not
take
to
space
and
so
furnish
ultimately
a
guarantee
of
peace
the
united
nations
would
face
the
alternatives
of
becoming
a
military
alliance
for
atomic
war
or
something
less
than
an
international
debating
society
of
course
there
were
less
significant
results
there
were
already
fourteen
popular
songs
ready
for
broadcast
orchestrated
and
rehearsed
with
singers
ready
to
saturate
the
ears
of
the
listening
public
they
ranged
from
got
a
warship
in
the
which
was
more
or
less
jingoistic
to
a
melody
entitled
have
a
moon
just
for
us
the
latter
tune
had
been
stolen
from
a
hit
of
four
years
before
which
in
turn
had
been
stolen
from
a
hit
of
six
years
before
that
and
it
had
been
stolen
from
a
still
earlier
bit
of
bach
so
it
was
a
rather
pretty
melody
and
of
course
there
was
a
motion
picture
epic
in
color
and
with
musical
numbers
champing
in
its
film
cans
for
simultaneous
showings
in
eight
different
key
cities
it
was
titled
the
and
three
separate
endings
had
been
filmed
of
which
the
appropriate
one
would
of
course
be
used
in
the
eight
separate
world
one
ending
had
the
platform
fail
due
to
sabotage
and
the
hero
played
by
an
actor
who
had
interrupted
his
seventh
honeymoon
to
play
the
part
splendidly
prepared
to
build
it
all
over
again
the
second
ending
closed
with
the
platform
headed
for
alpha
centaurus
which
was
hardly
the
intention
of
anybody
outside
of
filmdom
the
third
ending
was
secret
but
it
was
said
that
executives
had
cried
like
babies
when
it
was
thrown
on
preview
screens
these
of
course
were
merely
sidelights
they
were
not
very
important
in
the
shed
there
work
went
on
at
a
feverish
rate
although
there
was
no
longer
any
construction
work
to
be
done
in
theory
therefore
the
members
of
welders
and
and
and
electrical
and
other
unions
should
have
retired
gracefully
to
bootstrap
members
of
and
rigging
and
wrecking
and
other
assorted
unions
should
have
been
gathered
together
in
far
cities
screened
by
security
and
brought
to
bootstrap
and
paid
overtime
to
pull
up
flooring
and
unbolt
and
jack
out
the
proper
sections
of
the
shed
eastern
wall
but
if
there
had
been
anything
of
that
sort
tried
it
would
have
produced
bloodshed
the
men
who
built
the
platform
were
going
to
see
it
depart
this
earth
or
else
they
never
have
a
second
chance
it
would
work
the
first
time
or
it
would
work
at
all
so
the
platform
was
made
ready
for
its
by
the
men
who
had
made
it
a
gigantic
section
two
full
gores
of
the
shed
wall
was
unbolted
in
two
pieces
and
each
piece
thrust
outward
at
the
top
and
bottom
so
that
they
were
offset
from
the
rest
of
the
huge
there
were
hundreds
of
wheels
at
their
bottom
which
for
the
first
time
touched
the
sixteen
lines
of
rails
laid
with
unbelievable
solidity
around
the
outside
of
the
shed
and
then
the
monstrous
sections
were
rolled
aside
a
vast
opening
resulted
and
morning
sunlight
smote
for
the
first
time
mankind
very
first
space
craft
joe
saw
the
sunlight
strike
and
his
first
sensation
was
of
disappointment
the
normal
shape
of
the
platform
was
ungainly
but
now
it
was
practically
hidden
by
the
rockets
which
would
consume
themselves
in
their
firing
also
the
floor
of
the
shed
looked
strange
it
was
littered
with
the
clumsy
shapes
of
pushpots
trucked
to
this
place
in
an
unending
stream
all
night
long
a
very
young
lieutenant
from
the
pushpot
airfield
hunted
up
joe
and
assured
him
that
every
drop
of
fuel
in
every
pushpot
tanks
had
been
tested
twice
once
in
the
storage
tanks
and
again
in
the
pushpots
joe
thanked
him
very
politely
there
was
no
longer
any
scaffolding
there
were
no
trucks
left
except
two
gigantic
cranes
which
could
handle
the
pushpots
like
so
many
toys
and
the
effect
of
sunlight
pouring
into
the
shed
seemed
strange
indeed
outside
there
were
carpenters
hammering
professionally
upon
a
hasty
grandstand
of
timber
most
of
the
carpenters
would
have
been
handier
with
rivet
guns
or
welding
torches
but
it
would
have
been
indiscreet
to
comment
as
fast
as
a
final
timber
was
spiked
in
place
somebody
hastily
wound
it
with
very
tawdry
bunting
men
were
stringing
wires
to
the
grandstand
and
other
men
were
setting
up
television
and
movie
cameras
two
security
men
grimly
stood
by
each
camera
amid
a
glittering
miscellany
of
microphones
joe
was
lucky
or
perhaps
sally
pulled
wires
anyhow
the
two
of
them
had
a
vantage
point
for
which
many
other
people
would
have
paid
astonishing
sums
they
waited
where
the
circular
ramp
between
the
two
skins
of
the
shed
was
broken
by
the
removal
of
the
doorway
they
were
halfway
up
the
curve
of
the
shed
roof
at
the
edge
of
the
great
opening
and
they
could
see
everything
from
the
pushpot
pilots
as
they
were
checked
into
their
contraptions
to
the
sedate
arrival
of
the
big
brass
at
the
grandstand
below
there
was
a
reverberant
humming
from
the
shed
now
it
might
have
been
the
humming
of
wind
blowing
across
its
open
section
joe
and
sally
saw
a
grim
knot
of
security
men
escorting
four
crew
members
to
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
that
led
up
to
a
lower
door
joe
had
reason
to
remember
that
door
and
watched
them
enter
and
close
the
air
lock
behind
them
then
the
security
men
pulled
away
the
wooden
stairs
and
hauled
them
completely
away
there
were
a
very
few
highly
trusted
men
making
final
inspections
of
the
platform
exterior
one
of
them
was
nearly
on
a
level
with
joe
and
sally
other
men
were
already
lowering
themselves
down
on
ropes
that
they
later
jerked
free
but
this
last
man
on
top
did
a
very
human
thing
when
he
finished
his
to
the
last
least
detail
he
pulled
something
out
of
his
hip
pocket
it
was
a
tobacco
can
full
of
black
paint
there
was
a
brush
with
it
he
painted
his
name
on
the
silvery
plates
of
the
platform
adams
and
satisfiedly
began
his
descent
to
the
ground
his
name
would
go
up
with
the
platform
and
be
visible
for
uncounted
generations
if
all
went
well
he
reached
the
ground
and
walked
away
contented
the
cranes
began
their
task
each
one
reached
down
deliberately
and
picked
up
a
pushpot
they
swung
the
pushpots
to
vertical
positions
and
presented
them
precisely
to
the
platform
side
they
clung
there
ridiculously
magnetic
grapples
of
course
joe
and
sally
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
in
the
wall
could
see
the
heads
of
the
pushpot
pilots
in
their
plastic
domes
music
blared
from
behind
the
grandstand
the
seats
were
being
filled
but
naturally
the
least
important
personages
were
arriving
first
there
were
women
in
costumes
to
which
they
had
given
infinite
thought
and
nobody
looked
at
them
except
other
women
there
was
khaki
there
were
gray
business
suits
men
these
who
had
done
the
behind
the
platform
design
then
black
broadcloth
politicians
past
question
there
is
nothing
less
impressive
from
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
than
a
man
in
black
broadcloth
walking
on
the
ground
there
were
men
in
uniforms
which
were
not
of
the
united
states
armed
forces
they
ran
heavily
to
medals
which
glittered
there
were
more
arrivals
and
more
and
more
the
newsreel
and
tv
cameras
nosed
around
the
cranes
worked
methodically
they
dipped
and
deftly
picked
up
a
thing
shaped
like
the
top
half
of
a
loaf
of
bread
they
swung
that
metal
thing
to
the
platform
side
each
time
it
clung
fast
like
a
snail
or
slug
to
the
surface
on
which
it
crawls
many
pushpots
clung
even
to
the
rocket
tubes
the
same
tubes
that
would
presently
burn
away
and
vanish
so
joe
and
sally
saw
the
pushpots
in
a
new
aspect
blunt
metal
slugs
with
gaping
mouths
which
were
their
air
scoops
the
tinny
music
from
below
cut
off
somebody
began
an
oration
the
men
who
had
built
the
platform
were
not
interested
in
fine
phrases
but
this
event
was
broadcast
everywhere
and
some
people
might
possibly
tune
to
the
channels
that
carried
the
speakers
and
their
orations
rather
than
the
channels
that
showed
the
huge
bleak
obscured
shape
of
the
monster
that
was
headed
either
for
empty
space
or
pure
disaster
the
speaker
stopped
and
another
took
his
place
then
another
one
man
spoke
for
less
than
a
minute
and
the
stands
went
wild
but
the
one
who
followed
made
splendid
gestures
he
talked
and
talked
and
talked
the
cranes
cleaned
up
the
last
of
the
waiting
pushpots
and
the
platform
itself
was
practically
invisible
the
cranes
backed
off
and
went
away
clanking
the
orator
raised
his
voice
it
made
small
echoes
in
the
vast
cavern
that
was
the
shed
somebody
plucked
the
speaker
arm
he
ended
abruptly
and
sat
down
wiping
his
forehead
with
a
huge
blue
handkerchief
there
was
a
roar
a
pushpot
had
started
its
motor
another
roar
another
one
by
one
the
multitude
of
clustering
objects
added
to
the
din
in
the
open
a
single
jet
was
appalling
here
the
noise
became
a
sound
which
was
no
longer
a
sound
it
became
a
tumult
which
by
pure
volume
ceased
to
be
anything
one
ears
could
understand
it
reached
a
peak
and
held
there
then
abruptly
all
the
motors
slackened
in
unison
and
then
roared
more
loudly
the
group
controls
within
the
platform
were
being
tested
three
four
five
times
the
tumult
faded
to
the
merely
unbearable
and
went
up
to
full
volume
again
joe
felt
sally
plucking
at
his
arm
he
turned
and
saw
a
jet
underbelly
very
close
and
its
wings
it
was
climbing
straight
up
then
he
saw
another
jet
plane
streaking
for
the
great
dome
open
door
it
moved
with
incredible
velocity
it
jerked
upward
and
climbed
over
the
shed
curve
and
was
gone
but
there
were
others
and
others
and
others
these
were
the
fighter
ships
of
the
guard
for
months
on
end
they
had
flown
above
the
shed
protecting
it
now
they
were
going
aloft
to
relieve
the
present
watchers
they
were
rising
to
spread
out
as
an
interceptor
screen
for
hundreds
of
miles
in
every
direction
in
case
somebody
should
be
so
foolish
as
to
try
again
the
exploit
of
the
night
before
they
would
not
see
the
monster
in
the
shed
again
so
in
a
single
line
which
reached
to
the
horizon
they
made
this
roaring
run
for
the
one
last
glimpse
which
was
their
right
joe
saw
tiny
specks
come
streaking
down
out
of
the
sky
to
queue
up
for
this
privileged
view
of
the
platform
before
it
rose
suddenly
they
were
gone
and
joe
felt
that
tingling
sense
of
pride
which
never
comes
from
the
sensation
of
sharing
in
mere
power
or
splendor
or
pompous
might
but
is
so
certain
when
the
human
touch
modifies
magnificence
and
then
the
roaring
of
the
pushpot
engines
achieved
an
utterly
impossible
volume
the
whole
interior
of
the
shed
was
misty
now
but
shining
in
the
morning
light
and
the
platform
moved
at
first
it
was
a
mere
stirring
it
turned
ever
so
slightly
to
one
side
pivoting
on
the
ways
that
had
supported
it
during
building
it
turned
back
and
to
the
other
side
the
vapor
thickened
from
each
jet
motor
a
blast
of
flame
poured
down
and
the
moisture
in
the
earth
was
turning
into
steam
and
stray
into
acrid
smoke
the
platform
turned
precisely
and
exactly
back
to
its
original
position
and
heart
pounded
in
his
throat
because
he
knew
that
the
turning
had
been
done
with
the
gyros
and
they
had
been
handled
by
the
pilot
gyros
for
which
he
was
responsible
then
the
platform
moved
again
it
lifted
by
inches
and
swayed
forward
it
checked
and
lurched
again
and
went
staggering
toward
the
great
opening
before
it
a
part
of
its
base
gouged
a
deep
furrow
in
the
earthen
floor
the
noise
increased
from
the
incredible
to
the
inconceivable
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
thunders
since
time
began
had
returned
to
bellow
because
the
platform
moved
and
it
floated
and
bumped
out
of
the
shed
it
staggered
toward
the
east
its
keel
was
perhaps
at
this
point
as
much
as
three
feet
above
the
ground
but
the
jet
motors
cast
up
blinding
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
and
even
those
afoot
could
not
be
sure
there
was
confusion
the
smoke
and
vapor
splashed
out
in
every
possible
direction
joe
saw
frantic
movement
and
he
realized
that
the
uniforms
and
the
frock
coats
were
scrambling
to
escape
the
fumes
the
specks
which
were
men
seemed
to
run
the
frock
coats
ran
the
brighter
specks
which
were
women
ran
gasping
and
choking
from
the
smoke
one
stout
figure
toppled
scrambled
up
and
scuttled
frantically
for
safety
but
the
platform
was
in
motion
now
it
was
a
hundred
yards
beyond
the
shed
wall
two
hundred
three
it
slowly
gathered
speed
a
from
the
shed
it
was
definitely
clear
of
the
ground
it
left
a
trail
of
scorched
burnt
desert
behind
it
moved
almost
swiftly
now
two
miles
from
the
shed
it
was
fifteen
feet
above
the
earth
three
miles
and
a
clear
strip
of
sunlight
showed
beneath
it
and
it
was
still
accelerating
at
four
miles
and
five
and
six
it
was
aloft
climbing
with
seemingly
infinite
slowness
with
all
the
hundreds
of
straining
thrusting
clumsy
pushpots
clinging
to
it
and
pushing
it
ever
ahead
and
upward
it
went
smoothly
toward
the
east
it
continued
to
gain
speed
it
did
not
seem
to
dip
toward
the
horizon
at
all
it
went
on
and
on
dwindling
from
a
giant
to
a
spot
and
then
to
a
little
dark
speck
in
the
sky
that
still
went
on
and
on
until
even
joe
could
not
pretend
to
himself
that
he
still
saw
it
even
then
there
was
probably
a
tiny
droning
noise
in
the
air
but
nobody
who
had
watched
the
could
possibly
hear
it
then
joe
looked
at
sally
and
she
at
him
and
joe
was
grinning
like
an
ape
with
excitement
and
relief
and
triumph
which
was
at
once
his
own
and
that
of
all
his
dreams
sally
eyes
were
shining
and
exultant
she
hugged
him
in
purest
exuberance
crying
that
the
space
platform
was
up
was
up
was
up
at
sundown
they
were
waiting
on
the
porch
of
the
major
quarters
behind
the
shed
the
major
was
there
and
haney
and
the
chief
and
mike
and
joe
the
major
whole
look
had
changed
he
seemed
to
have
shrunk
and
he
looked
more
tired
than
any
man
should
ever
be
allowed
to
get
but
his
job
was
done
and
the
reaction
was
enough
to
explain
everything
he
sat
in
an
easy
chair
with
a
glass
beside
him
and
he
looked
as
if
nothing
on
earth
could
make
him
move
a
finger
but
nevertheless
he
was
waiting
sally
came
out
with
a
tray
she
gravely
passed
around
the
glasses
and
the
cakes
that
went
with
them
then
she
sat
down
on
the
porch
steps
beside
joe
she
looked
at
him
and
nodded
in
friendly
fashion
and
joe
was
inordinately
approving
of
sally
but
he
felt
awkward
at
showing
it
too
plainly
in
her
father
presence
mike
said
defiantly
but
still
it
woulda
been
easier
to
get
it
up
there
if
it
been
built
for
guys
like
me
nobody
contradicted
him
he
was
right
anyhow
every
one
of
them
felt
too
much
relaxed
and
relieved
to
enter
into
argument
haney
said
dreamily
everything
broke
right
everything
they
got
in
a
jet
stream
like
they
expected
and
it
gave
three
hundred
miles
extra
they
were
eight
miles
up
when
the
pushpots
fired
their
jatos
an
twelve
miles
up
when
the
pushpots
let
go
they
musta
near
broke
their
pilots
necks
when
they
caught
their
motors
again
and
the
platform
rockets
fired
just
right
makin
flames
a
mile
long
an
they
were
goin
then
what
were
they
makin
who
cares
asked
the
chief
peacefully
plenty
six
hundred
from
the
pushpots
murmured
haney
frowning
an
three
hundred
from
the
jet
stream
and
then
there
was
the
jatos
that
all
let
go
at
once
an
then
there
was
eight
hundred
from
the
earth
rotatin
they
had
ten
per
cent
of
their
rockets
unfired
when
they
got
into
their
orbit
said
mike
authoritatively
they
were
two
thousand
miles
up
when
they
passed
over
india
and
now
they
four
thousand
miles
up
and
the
orbit
stable
this
is
their
third
round
is
it
will
be
said
the
chief
joe
and
sally
sat
watching
the
west
the
space
platform
went
around
the
earth
from
west
to
east
like
earth
natural
moon
but
because
of
its
speed
it
would
rise
in
the
west
and
set
in
the
east
six
times
in
every
hours
major
holt
spoke
suddenly
the
austerity
had
gone
out
of
his
manner
with
his
energy
he
said
quietly
you
four
you
gave
me
the
worst
scare
ever
had
in
my
life
but
do
you
realize
that
that
sabotage
attempt
with
the
two
of
explosive
do
you
realize
that
they
have
gotten
the
platform
if
it
had
been
for
that
crazy
trick
you
four
planned
and
the
precautions
we
took
because
of
it
joe
said
depreciatingly
it
was
just
luck
that
they
happened
to
pick
the
same
time
and
that
haney
was
up
there
with
those
at
the
right
moment
it
was
good
luck
but
it
was
luck
the
major
said
effortfully
there
are
people
called
accident
prones
accidents
happen
all
around
them
and
nobody
knows
why
you
four
perhaps
joe
especially
are
not
accident
prones
you
seem
to
be
something
antithetic
to
accidents
i
would
hesitate
to
credit
your
usefulness
to
your
brains
especially
joe
brains
i
have
known
him
too
long
but
ah
washington
does
not
look
at
it
in
exactly
the
same
way
sally
touched
joe
warningly
but
her
face
was
very
bright
and
proud
joe
felt
queer
joe
said
the
major
tiredly
was
an
alternate
for
membership
in
the
platform
crew
but
for
penicillin
or
something
of
the
sort
that
made
a
sick
man
get
well
quickly
joe
would
be
up
there
in
the
orbit
now
his
ah
record
in
the
instruction
he
did
take
was
satisfactory
and
ah
all
four
of
you
were
very
useful
in
the
last
stages
of
the
building
of
the
platform
again
joe
especially
his
ah
with
higher
authorities
has
produced
ah
very
favorable
comments
so
it
is
felt
that
he
should
have
some
recognition
all
of
you
of
course
but
joe
especially
so
joe
felt
himself
going
white
joe
said
the
major
is
to
be
offered
an
appointment
as
skipper
of
a
ferry
rocket
carrying
supplies
and
crew
reliefs
to
the
platform
his
rocket
will
carry
a
crew
of
four
including
himself
his
ah
recommendations
for
membership
in
his
crew
will
have
considerable
weight
there
was
a
buzzing
in
joe
ears
he
wanted
to
cry
and
to
dance
and
especially
right
then
he
would
have
liked
very
much
to
kiss
sally
it
would
have
been
the
only
really
appropriate
way
to
express
his
emotions
mike
said
in
a
fierce
strained
voice
joe
i
can
do
anything
a
big
elephant
of
a
guy
can
do
and
i
only
use
a
quarter
of
the
grub
and
air
you
got
to
take
me
joe
you
got

slowly
sally
turned
her
face
away
from
joe
and
looked
up
then
they
all
saw
it
a
telescope
maybe
would
have
shown
it
as
the
thing
they
worked
on
and
fought
for
but
it
did
look
like
that
to
the
naked
eye
it
was
just
a
tiny
speck
of
incandescence
gliding
with
grave
deliberation
across
the
sky
it
was
a
sliver
of
sunlight
moving
as
they
watched
there
were
a
good
many
millions
of
people
watching
it
just
then
as
it
floated
aloft
in
emptiness
to
some
it
meant
peace
and
hope
and
confidence
of
a
serene
old
age
and
a
life
worth
living
for
their
children
and
their
children
children
to
some
it
was
a
fascinating
technical
achievement
to
a
few
it
meant
that
if
wars
had
ended
and
turmoil
was
no
longer
the
norm
of
life
on
earth
this
thing
would
be
their
destruction
but
it
meant
something
to
everybody
in
the
world
to
the
people
who
had
been
unable
to
do
anything
to
help
it
except
to
pray
for
it
perhaps
it
meant
most
of
all
