recollections

a

scotland
prefatory
note
the
journals
written
by
dorothy
wordsworth
and
her
reminiscences
of
tours
made
with
her
brother
are
more
interesting
to
posterity
than
her
letters
a
few
fragments
from
her
grasmere
journal
were
included
by
the
late
bishop
of
lincoln
in
the
of
his
uncle
published
in
the
of
a
tour
made
in
in
were
edited
in
full
by
the
late
principal
shairp
in
the
year
third
edition
in
i
included
in
my
of
william
most
of
the
journal
written
at
alfoxden
much
of
that
referring
to
hamburg
and
the
greater
part
of
the
longer
grasmere
journal
some
extracts
from
the
journal
of
a
tour
on
the
continent
made
in
and
of
a
similar
one
written
by
wordsworth
as
well
as
short
records
of
subsequent
visits
to
scotland
and
to
the
isle
of
man
were
printed
in
the
same
volume
none
of
these
however
were
given
in
their
entirety
nor
is
it
desirable
now
to
print
them
except
in
the
case
of
the
of
a
tour
made
in
in
all
the
journals
contain
numerous
trivial
details
which
bear
ample
witness
to
the
plain
living
and
high
thinking
of
the
wordsworth
household
and
in
this
edition
samples
of
these
details
are
given
but
there
is
no
need
to
record
all
the
cases
in
which
the
sister
wrote
i
mended
william
shirts
or
william
gathered
sticks
or
i
went
in
search
of
eggs
etc
etc
in
all
cases
however
in
which
a
sentence
or
paragraph
or
several
sentences
and
paragraphs
in
the
journals
are
left
out
the
omission
is
indicated
by
means
of
asterisks
nothing
is
omitted
of
any
literary
or
biographical
value
some
persons
may
think
that
too
much
has
been
recorded
others
that
everything
should
have
been
printed
as
to
this
posterity
must
judge
i
think
that
many
in
future
years
will
value
these
journals
not
only
as
a
record
of
the
relations
existing
between
wordsworth
and
his
sister
his
wife
her
family
and
his
friends
but
also
as
an
illustration
of
the
remarkable
literary
brotherhood
and
sisterhood
of
the
period
coming
now
to
details
i
i
do
not
know
of
any
journal
written
at
racedown
and
i
do
not
think
that
dorothy
kept
one
while
she
and
her
brother
lived
in
dorsetshire
in
july
they
took
up
their
residence
at
alfoxden
but
so
far
as
is
known
it
was
not
till
the
of
january
that
dorothy
began
to
write
a
journal
of
her
own
and
her
brother
life
at
that
place
it
was
continued
uninterruptedly
till
thursday
may
it
gives
numerous
details
as
to
the
visits
of
coleridge
to
alfoxden
and
the
wordsworths
visits
to
him
at
as
well
as
of
the
circumstances
under
which
several
of
their
poems
were
composed
many
sentences
in
the
journal
present
a
curious
resemblance
to
words
and
phrases
which
occur
in
the
poems
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
as
brother
and
sister
made
use
of
the
same
some
of
wordsworth
own
verses
having
been
written
by
him
in
his
sister
journal
the
copartnery
may
have
extended
to
more
than
the
common
use
of
the
same
ms
the
archaic
spellings
which
occur
in
this
journal
are
retained
but
inaccuracies
such
as
bartelmy
for
bartholemew
crewkshank
for
cruikshank
are
corrected
in
the
edition
of
the
words
were
printed
as
written
in
but
it
is
one
thing
to
reproduce
the
text
of
a
journal
or
the
of
a
poet
and
quite
another
to
reproduce
the
incorrect
spellings
of
his
sister
ii
from
the
journal
of
the
days
spent
at
hamburg
in
when
the
wordsworths
were
on
their
way
to
goslar
and
coleridge
to
ratzeburg
only
a
few
extracts
are
given
dating
from
september
to
october
of
that
year
these
explain
themselves
of
the
grasmere
journals
much
more
is
given
and
a
great
deal
that
was
omitted
from
the
first
volume
of
the
of
in
is
now
printed
to
many
readers
this
will
be
by
far
the
most
interesting
section
of
all
dorothy
wordsworth
writings
it
not
only
contains
exquisite
descriptions
of
grasmere
and
its
district
a
most
felicitous
record
of
the
changes
of
the
seasons
and
the
progress
of
the
year
details
as
to
flower
and
tree
bird
and
beast
mountain
and
lake
but
it
casts
a
flood
of
light
on
the
circumstances
under
which
her
poems
were
composed
it
also
discloses
much
as
to
the
doings
of
the
wordsworth
household
of
the
visits
of
coleridge
and
others
while
it
vividly
illustrates
the
peasant
life
of
westmoreland
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
what
i
have
seen
of
this
journal
extends
from
may
to
december
and
from
october
to
january
it
is
here
printed
in
four
sections
vii
when
the
late
principal
shairp
edited
the
of
a
tour
made
in
in
he
inserted
an
elaborate
and
valuable
introduction
with
a
few
explanatory
and
topographical
notes
with
the
consent
of
shairp
and
of
the
principal
son
sheriff
shairp
many
of
them
are
now
reproduced
with
the
initials
appended
as
some
notes
were
needed
at
these
places
and
i
could
only
have
slightly
varied
the
statements
of
fact
it
seemed
better
for
the
reader
and
more
respectful
to
the
memory
of
such
a
wordsworthian
as
the
late
principal
was
to
record
them
as
his
i
cordially
thank
shairp
and
her
son
for
their
kindness
in
this
matter
it
should
be
added
that
dorothy
wordsworth
archaic
spelling
of
many
of
the
names
of
places
such
as
lanerk
ulswater
strath
eyer
loch
ketterine
inversneyde
are
retained
these
recollections
of
the
tour
made
in
scotland
were
not
all
written
down
at
the
time
during
the
journey
many
of
them
were
afterthoughts
the
alfoxden
and
grasmere
journals
were
diaries
in
the
sense
that
except
when
the
contrary
is
stated
they
were
written
down
day
by
day
but
certain
portions
of
the
scottish
journal
suggest
either
that
they
were
entirely
written
after
the
return
to
grasmere
or
were
then
considerably
expanded
i
have
not
seen
the
original
dorothy
transcribed
it
in
full
for
her
friend
clarkson
commencing
the
work
in
and
finishing
it
on
may
see
vol
ii
this
transcript
i
have
seen
it
is
the
only
one
now
traceable
it
should
be
mentioned
that
dorothy
wordsworth
was
often
quite
incorrect
in
her
dates
both
as
to
the
day
of
the
week
and
the
month
minute
accuracy
on
these
points
did
not
count
for
much
at
that
time
and
very
often
a
mistake
in
the
date
of
one
entry
in
her
journal
brought
with
it
a
long
series
of
future
errors
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
grasmere
journal
and
to
the
record
of
the
continental
tour
of
many
friends
and
students
of
wordsworth
regretted
the
long
delay
in
the
publication
of
the
tour
made
in
scotland
in
in
the
of
the
of
samuel
we
find
the
following
i
do
indeed
regret
that
wordsworth
has
printed
only
fragments
of
his
sister
journal
it
is
most
excellent
and
ought
to
have
been
published
entire
it
will
always
hold
a
place
of
honour
in
itinerary
literature
it
possesses
a
singular
charm
and
has
abiding
interest
not
only
as
a
record
of
travel
but
also
as
a
mirror
of
scottish
life
and
character
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
viii
the
journal
of
a
mountain
ramble
by
william
and
dorothy
wordsworth
in
november
calls
for
no
special
remark
the
ramble
was
from
grasmere
by
rydal
and
kirkstone
pass
to
patterdale
and
ullswater
thence
to
the
top
of
place
fell
at
the
foot
of
which
wordsworth
thought
of
buying
and
did
afterwards
buy
a
small
property
near
the
lake
thence
to
yanworth
returning
to
grasmere
by
kirkstone
again
the
story
of
this
ramble
written
by
dorothy
was
afterwards
incorporated
in
part
by
william
wordsworth
in
his
prose
of
the
scenery
of
the
another
curious
instance
of
their
literary
copartnery
ix
in
the
poet
his
wife
and
sister
along
with
and
monkhouse
and
miss
horrocks
a
sister
of
monkhouse
spent
more
than
three
months
on
the
continent
they
left
lambeth
on
the
of
july
and
returned
to
london
in
november
starting
from
dover
on
july
they
went
by
brussels
to
cologne
up
the
rhine
to
switzerland
were
joined
by
henry
crabb
robinson
at
lucerne
crossed
over
to
the
italian
lakes
visited
milan
came
back
to
switzerland
and
passed
through
france
to
paris
where
they
spent
a
month
dorothy
wordsworth
wrote
a
minute
and
very
careful
journal
of
this
tour
taking
notes
at
the
time
and
extending
them
on
her
return
to
westmoreland
wordsworth
kept
a
shorter
record
of
the
same
journey
crabb
robinson
also
wrote
a
diary
of
it
wordsworth
recorded
and
idealised
his
tour
in
a
series
of
poems
named
by
him
memorials
of
a
tour
on
the
continent
very
few
of
which
were
written
on
the
spot
and
when
in
the
of
rydal
mount
he
set
to
work
upon
them
it
is
evident
that
he
consulted
and
made
frequent
use
of
the
two
family
journals
particularly
the
one
written
by
his
sister
in
a
letter
to
clarkson
from
coblentz
dated
july
dorothy
said
journals
we
shall
have
in
abundance
for
all
except
my
brother
and
monkhouse
keep
a
journal
mine
is
nothing
but
notes
unintelligible
to
any
one
but
myself
i
look
forward
however
to
many
a
pleasant
hour
employment
at
rydal
mount
in
filling
up
the
chasms
the
originals
of
these
two
journals
still
exist
and
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
the
jottings
taken
at
the
time
by
the
wife
or
the
extended
journal
afterwards
written
by
the
sister
is
the
more
admirable
both
as
a
record
of
travel
and
as
a
commentary
on
the
poet
work
dorothy
is
nearly
as
long
as
her
recollections
of
the
scottish
tour
of
extracts
from
both
journals
were
published
in
the
library
edition
of
the
poems
in
and
in
the
of
william
in
but
these
were
limited
to
passages
illustrative
of
the
poems
it
is
not
expedient
to
print
either
journal
in
full
there
are
however
so
many
passages
of
interest
and
beauty
in
each
presenting
a
vivid
picture
of
the
towns
and
countries
through
which
the
wordsworths
passed
and
of
the
style
of
continental
travelling
in
those
days
that
it
seems
desirable
to
insert
more
numerous
extracts
from
them
than
those
which
have
been
already
printed
they
will
be
found
to
illustrate
much
of
the
state
of
things
in
germany
switzerland
italy
and
france
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
century
while
they
afford
an
interesting
contrast
to
that
which
meets
the
eye
of
the
traveller
and
ministers
to
his
wants
at
the
present
day
in
the
pages
extracted
from
journal
alone
it
is
such
passages
that
have
in
the
main
been
selected
in
october
robinson
was
a
visitor
at
rydal
mount
and
after
reading
over
the
journals
of
and
dorothy
wordsworth
he
wrote
thus
in
his
i
read
part
of
miss
and
also
journal
in
switzerland
they
put
mine
to
shame
they
had
adopted
a
plan
of
journalising
which
could
not
fail
to
render
the
account
amusing
and
informing
in
particular
frequently
described
as
in
a
panorama
the
objects
around
her
and
these
were
written
on
the
spot
and
i
recollect
her
often
sitting
on
the
grass
not
aware
of
what
kind
of
employment
she
had
now
it
is
evident
that
a
succession
of
such
pictures
must
represent
the
face
of
the
country
their
journals
were
alike
abundant
in
observation
in
which
the
writers
showed
an
enviable
faculty
and
were
sparing
of
reflections
which
ought
rather
to
be
excited
by
than
obtruded
in
a
book
of
travels
i
think
i
shall
profit
on
some
future
occasion
by
the
hint
i
have
taken
footnote
perhaps
the
most
interesting
entry
in
henry
crabb
robinson
journal
of
the
tour
is
the
following
june
i
made
some
cheap
purchases
if
anything
can
be
cheap
again
in
november
robinson
wrote
finished
wordsworth
journal
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
felt
more
humble
than
in
reading
it
it
is
so
superior
to
my
own
she
saw
so
much
more
than
i
did
though
we
were
side
by
side
during
a
great
part
of
the
time
robinson
advised
dorothy
wordsworth
to
publish
her
journal
of
this
continental
tour
and
she
replied
to
him
may
your
advice
respecting
my
continental
journal
is
i
am
sure
very
good
provided
it
were
worth
while
to
make
a
book
of
it
provided
i
do
so
and
provided
it
were
my
wish
but
it
is
not
better
i
say
another
tour
and
write
the
journal
on
a
different
plan
in
recopying
it
i
should
as
you
advise
omit
considerable
portions
of
the
description
but
observe
my
object
is
not
to
make
a
book
but
to
leave
to
my
niece
a
memorial
of
those
few
interesting
months
of
our
lives
x
in
dorothy
wordsworth
went
with
joanna
hutchinson
to
scotland
for
change
of
air
and
scene
she
wrote
of
this
journey
i
had
for
years
promised
joanna
to
go
with
her
to
edinburgh
that
was
her
object
but
we
planned
a
little
tour
up
the
forth
to
stirling
thence
by
to
glasgow
from
dumbarton
to
rob
roy
cave
by
steam
stopping
at
tarbet
thence
in
a
cart
to
inverary
back
again
to
glasgow
down
loch
fyne
and
up
the
clyde
thence
on
the
coach
to
lanark
and
from
lanark
to
moffat
in
a
cart
there
we
stopped
two
days
my
companion
being
an
invalid
and
she
fancied
the
waters
might
cure
her
but
a
which
nobody
frequents
is
never
in
order
and
we
were
glad
to
leave
moffat
crossing
the
wild
country
again
in
a
cart
to
the
banks
of
the
river
esk
we
returned
to
edinburgh
for
the
sake
of
warm
baths
we
were
three
weeks
in
lodgings
at
edinburgh
joanna
had
much
of
that
sort
of
pleasure
which
one
has
in
first
seeing
a
foreign
country
and
in
our
travels
whether
on
the
outside
of
a
coach
on
the
deck
of
a
steamboat
or
in
whatever
way
we
got
forward
she
was
always
cheerful
never
complaining
of
bad
fare
bad
inns
or
anything
else
it
was
a
short
excursion
but
was
memorialised
in
the
usual
way
by
dorothy
ever
ready
pen
xi
in
the
following
year
wordsworth
and
his
wife
left
lee
priory
for
a
little
tour
in
flanders
and
holland
as
he
phrased
it
in
a
letter
to
john
kenyon
he
wrote
may
we
shall
go
to
dover
with
a
view
to
embark
for
ostend
unless
detained
by
similar
obstacles
from
ostend
we
mean
to
go
to
ghent
to
antwerp
breda
utrecht
amsterdam
to
rotterdam
by
haarlem
the
hague
and
leyden
thence
to
antwerp
by
another
route
and
perhaps
shall
return
by
mechlin
brussels
lille
and
ypres
to
calais
or
direct
to
ostend
as
we
came
we
hope
to
be
landed
in
england
within
a
month
we
shall
hurry
through
london
homewards
where
we
are
naturally
anxious
already
to
be
having
left
rydal
mount
so
far
back
as
february
the
extracts
taken
from
mary
wordsworth
journal
show
how
far
they
conformed
to
and
how
far
they
departed
from
their
original
plan
of
travel
in
them
will
be
found
the
same
directness
and
simplicity
the
same
vividness
of
touch
as
are
seen
in
her
journal
of
the
longer
tour
taken
in
xii
in
dorothy
wordsworth
went
to
the
isle

called
me
into

observe
a
singular
appearance
about

a

within

one
star
only

of
the
pattering
shower
and
the
gusts
of

very
grand

when
nothing
remained
of

a
burthen
of
large
rotten
boughs
blown
down
by

the
sun
shone
clear

all
at
once
a
heavy
blackness
hung
over
the

the
trees
almost
and
the
ground
seemed
in
motion
with
the
multitudes
of
dancing
leaves
which
made
a
rustling
sound
distinct
from
that
of

still
the
asses
pastured
in
quietness
under
the
hollies
undisturbed
by

forerunners
of

walked

nearly
to

after

a
very
clear
afternoon
we
lay
sidelong
upon
the
turf
and
gazed
on
the
landscape
till
it
melted
into
more
than
natural
loveliness
the
sea
very
uniform
of
a
pale
greyish
blue
only
one
distant
bay
bright
and
blue
as
a
sky
had
there
been
a

sailing
up
it
a
perfect
image
of
delight
walked
to
the
top
of
a
high
hill
to
see
a
fortification
again
sat
down
to
feed
upon
the
prospect
a
magnificent
scene
spread
out
for
even
minute
inspection
though
so
extensive
that
the
mind
is
afraid
to
calculate
its
bounds
a
winter
prospect
shows
every
cottage
every
farm
and
the
forms
of
distant
trees
such
as
in
summer
have
no
distinguishing
mark
on
our
return
jupiter
and
venus
before
us
while
the
twilight
still
overpowered
the
light
of
the
moon
we
were
reminded
that
she
was
shining
bright
above
our
heads
by
our
faint
shadows
going
before
us
we
had
seen
her
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
melting
into

sky

the

moving

nothing

leaf

elbe
crowded
with
vessels
of
all
nations
landed
at
the
boom
house
where
we
were
received
by
porters
ready
to
carry
our
luggage
to
any
part
of
the
town
william
went
to
seek
lodgings
and
the
rest
of
the
party
guarded
the
luggage
two
boats
were
about
to
depart
an
elegant
english
carriage
was
placed
in
one
and
presently
a
very
pretty
woman
conducted
by
a
gentleman
seated
herself
in
it
and
they
rowed
off
the
other
contained
a
medley
crew
of
all
ages
there
was
an
old
woman
with
a
blue
cap
trimmed
with
broad
silver
lace
and
tied
under
her
chin
she
had
a
short
coloured
cloak
etc
while
we
stood
in
the
street
which
was
open
on
one
side
to
the
elbe
i
was
much
amused
by
the
various
employments
and
dresses
of
the
people
who
passed
before
us
there
were
dutch
women
with
immense
straw
bonnets
with
flat
crowns
and
rims
in
the
shape
of
oyster
shells
without
trimming
or
with
only
a
plain
riband
round
the
crown
and
literally
as
large
as
a
umbrella
hamburgher
girls
with
white
caps
with
broad
overhanging
borders
crimped
and
stiff
and
long
lappets
of
riband
hanoverians
with
round
borders
showing
all
the
face
and
standing
upright
a
profusion
of
riband
with
large
straw
hats
in
the
shape
of
an
inverted
bowl
or
white
handkerchiefs
tied
round
the
head
like
a
bishop
mitre
jackets
the
most
common
often
the
petticoat
and
jacket
of
different
colours
the
ladies
without
hats
in
dresses
of
all
fashions
soldiers
with
red
coats
and
immense
cocked
hats
the
men
little
differing
from
the
english
except
that
they
have
generally
a
pipe
in
their
mouths
after
waiting
about
an
hour
we
saw
wm
appear
two
porters
carried
our
luggage
upon
a
sort
of
wheelbarrow
and
we
were
conducted
through
dirty
streets
to
an
inn
where
with
great
difficulty
and
after
long
seeking
lodgings
had
been
procured
for
us
breakfasted
with
mons
de
loutre
chester
and
i
went
to
the
promenade
people
of
all
ranks
and
in
various
dresses
walking
backwards
and
forwards
ladies
with
small
baskets
hanging
on
their
arms
long
shawls
of
various
colours
thrown
over
their
shoulders
the
women
of
the
lower
order
dressed
with
great
modesty
went
to
the
french
theatre
in
the
evening
the
piece
a
mixture
of
dull
declamation
and
unmeaning
rant
the
ballet
unintelligible
to
us
as
the
story
was
carried
on
in
singing
the
body
of
the
house
very
imperfectly
lighted
which
has
a
good
effect
in
bringing
out
the
stage
but
the
acting
was
not
very
amusing
william
went
in
the
boat
to
harburgh
in
our
road
to
the
boat
we
looked
into
one
of
the
large
churches
service
was
just
ended
the
audience
appeared
to
be
simply
composed
of
singing
boys
dressed
in
large
cocked
hats
and
a
few
old
women
who
sat
in
the
aisles
met
many
girls
with
white
caps
carrying
black
in
their
hands
coleridge
went
to
ratzeberg
at
five
in
the
diligence
chester
accompanied
me
towards
altona
the
streets
wide
and
pleasant
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
immense
crowds
of
people
walking
for
pleasure
and
many
passing
and
repassing
passed
through
a
nest
of
jews
were
invited
to
view
an
exhibition
of
waxwork
the
theatres
open
and
the
attended
the
walks
very
pleasing
between
hamburgh
and
altona
a
large
piece
of
ground
planted
with
trees
and
intersected
by
gravel
walks
music
cakes
fruit
carriages
and
of
all
descriptions
a
very
good
view
of
the
shipping
and
of
altona
and
the
town
and
spires
of
hamburgh
i
could
not
but
remark
how
much
the
prospect
would
have
suffered
by
one
of
our
english
canopies
of
coal
smoke
the
ground
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
elbe
appears
marshy
there
are
many
little
canals
or
lines
of
water
while
the
sun
was
yet
shining
pleasantly
we
were
obliged
to
blink
perpetually
to
turn
our
eyes
to
the
church
clock
the
gates
are
shut
at
six
and
there
is
no
admittance
into
the
city
after
that
time
this
idea
deducts
much
from
the
pleasure
of
an
evening
walk
you
are
haunted
by
it
long
before
the
time
has
elapsed
dined
with
klopstock
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
his
brother
the
poet
a
venerable
old
man
retaining
the
liveliness
and
alertness
of
youth
though
he
evidently
can
not
be
very
far
from
the
grave
the
party
talked
with
much
interest
of
the
french
comedy
and
seemed
fond
of
music
the
poet
and
his
lady
were
obliged
to
depart
soon
after
six
he
sustained
an
animated
conversation
with
william
during
the
whole
afternoon
poor
old
man
i
could
not
look
upon
him
the
benefactor
of
his
country
the
father
of
german
poetry
without
emotion
during
my
residence
in
hamburgh
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
a
quarrel
in
the
streets
but
once
and
that
was
so
trifling
that
it
would
scarcely
have
been
noticed
in
england
in
the
shops
except
the
established
booksellers
and
stationers
i
have
constantly
observed
a
disposition
to
cheat
and
take
advantage
of
our
ignorance
of
the
language
and
money
william
and
i
set
forward
at
twelve
to
altona
the
elbe
in
the
vicinity
of
hamburgh
is
so
divided
and
spread
out
that
the
country
looks
more
like
a
plain
overflowed
by
heavy
rain
than
the
bed
of
a
great
river
we
went
about
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
altona
the
roads
dry
and
sandy
and
a
causeway
for
the
houses
on
the
banks
of
the
elbe
chiefly
of
brick
seemed
very
warm
and
well
built
the
small
cottage
houses
seemed
to
have
little
gardens
and
all
the
gentlemen
houses
were
surrounded
by
gardens
quaintly
disposed
in
beds
and
curious
knots
with
gravel
walks
and
bending
poplars
the
view
of
the
elbe
and
the
spreading
country
must
be
very
interesting
in
a
fine
sunset
there
is
a
want
of
some
atmospherical
irradiation
to
give
a
richness
to
the
view
on
returning
home
we
were
accosted
by
the
first
beggar
whom
we
have
seen
since
our
arrival
at
hamburgh
sought
coleridge
at
the
bookseller
and
went
to
the
promenade
all
the
hamburghers
full
of
admiral
nelson
victory
called
at
a
baker
shop
put
two
shillings
into
the
baker
hands
for
which
i
was
to
have
had
four
small
rolls
he
gave
me
two
i
let
him
understand
that
i
was
to
have
four
and
with
this
view
i
took
one
shilling
from
him
pointed
to
it
and
to
two
loaves
and
at
the
same
time
offering
it
to
him
again
i
took
up
two
others
in
a
savage
manner
he
half
knocked
the
rolls
out
of
my
hand
and
when
i
asked
him
for
the
other
shilling
he
refused
to
return
it
and
would
neither
suffer
me
to
take
bread
nor
give
me
back
my
money
and
on
these
terms
i
quitted
the
shop
i
am
informed
that
it
is
the
boast
and
glory
of
these
people
to
cheat
strangers
that
when
a
feat
of
this
kind
is
successfully
performed
the
man
goes
from
the
shop
into
his
house
and
triumphantly
relates
it
to
his
wife
and
family
the
hamburgher
shopkeepers
have
three
sorts
of
weights
and
a
great
part
of
their
skill
as
shopkeepers
consists
in
calculating
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
buyer
and
suiting
him
with
scales
accordingly
the
grand
festival
of
the
hamburghers
dedicated
to
saint
michael
observed
with
solemnity
but
little
festivity
perhaps
this
might
be
partly
owing
to
the
raininess
of
the
evening
in
the
morning
the
churches
were
opened
very
early
christopher
was
quite
full
between
eight
and
nine
it
is
a
large
building
immense
without
either
grandeur
or
beauty
built
of
brick
and
with
few
windows
there
are
some
pictures
one
of
the
saint
fording
the
river
with
christ
upon
his
back
a
giant
figure
which
amused
me
not
a
little
walked
with
coleridge
and
chester
upon
the
promenade
we
took
places
in
the
morning
in
the
brunswick
coach
for
wednesday
coleridge
and
chester
went
to
ratzeberg
at
seven
in
the
morning
william
and
i
set
forward
at
eleven
with
an
intention
of
going
to
blankenese
the
buildings
all
seem
solid
and
warm
in
themselves
but
still
they
look
cold
from
their
nakedness
of
trees
they
are
generally
newly
built
and
placed
in
gardens
which
are
planted
in
front
with
poplars
and
low
shrubs
but
the
possessors
seem
to
have
no
prospective
view
to
a
shelter
for
their
children
they
do
not
plant
behind
their
houses
all
the
buildings
of
this
character
are
near
the
road
which
runs
at
different
distances
from
the
edge
of
the
bank
which
rises
from
the
river
this
bank
is
generally
steep
scattered
over
with
trees
which
are
either
not
of
ancient
growth
or
from
some
cause
do
not
thrive
but
serve
very
well
to
shelter
and
often
conceal
the
more
humble
dwellings
which
are
close
to
the
sandy
bank
of
the
river
we
saw
many
carriages
in
one
of
them
was
klopstock
the
poet
there
are
many
inns
and
by
the
roadside
we
went
to
a
pretty
village
or
nest
of
houses
about
a
league
from
blankenese
and
beyond
to
a
large
open
field
enclosed
on
one
side
with
oak
trees
through
which
winds
a
pleasant
gravel
walk
on
the
other
it
is
open
to
the
river
when
we
were
within
about
a
mile
and
a
half
or
two
miles
of
altona
we
turned
out
of
the
road
to
go
down
to
the
river
and
pursued
our
way
along
the
path
that
leads
from
house
to
house
these
houses
are
low
never
more
than
two
storeys
high
built
of
brick
or
a
mixture
of
brick
and
wood
and
thatched
or
tiled
they
have
all
which
are
painted
frequently
a
grey
light
green
but
always
painted
we
were
astonished
at
the
excessive
neatness
which
we
observed
in
the
arrangement
of
everything
within
these
houses
they
have
all
window
curtains
as
white
as
snow
the
floors
of
all
that
we
saw
were
perfectly
clean
and
the
brass
vessels
as
bright
as
a
mirror
i
imagine
these
houses
are
chiefly
inhabited
by
sailors
pilots
and
others
whose
business
is
upon
the
water

after
a
flood

my

was
easier
the

looked
to
me
i
knew
not
why
dull
and
melancholy
and
the
weltering
on
the
shores
seemed
a
heavy
sound
i
walked
as
long
as
i
could

description

startled
but
called
from
my
reverie
by
a
noise
as
of
a
child
paddling
without
shoes
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
lamb
close
to
me
it
approached
nearer

nearer

if
to

me
and
stood
a
long
time

soft
green

heavy
rain
the

calm
and
very
beautiful
those
parts
of
the
water
which

perfectly
unruffled
lay
like
green
islands
of
various
shapes
william
and
i
walked
to
ambleside
to
seek
lodgings
for
no
letters
no
papers
it
was
a
very
cold
cheerless
evening
john
had
been
fishing
in
langdale
and
was
gone
to
bed
a
very
tall
woman
tall
much
beyond
the
measure
of
tall
women
called
at
the
door
she
had
on
a
very
long
brown
cloak
and
a
very
white
cap
without
bonnet
her
face
was
excessively
brown
but
it
had
plainly
once
been
fair
she
led
a
little
child
about
two
years
old
by
the
hand
and
said
her
husband
who
was
a
tinker
was
gone
before
with
the
other
children
i
gave
her
a
piece
of
bread
afterwards
on
my
way
to
ambleside
beside
the
bridge
at
rydale
i
saw
her
husband
sitting
by
the
roadside
his
two
asses
feeding
beside
him
and
the
two
young
children
at
play
upon
the
grass
the
man
did
not
beg
i
passed
on
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
further
i
saw
two
boys
before
me
one
about
the
other
about
years
old
at
play
chasing
a
butterfly
they
were
wild
figures
not
very
ragged
but
without
shoes
and
stockings
the
hat
of
the
elder
was
wreathed
round
with
yellow
flowers
the
younger
whose
hat
was
only
a
rimless
crown
had
stuck
it
round
with
laurel
leaves
they
continued
at
play
till
i
drew
very
near
and
then
they
addressed
me
with
the
begging
cant
and
the
whining
voice
of
sorrow
i
said
i
served
your
mother
this
morning
the
boys
were
so
like
the
woman
who
had
called
at
that
i
could
not
be
mistaken
o
says
the
elder
you
could
not
serve
my
mother
for
she
dead
and
my
father
on
at
the
next
town
he
a
potter
i
persisted
in
my
assertion
and
that
i
would
give
them
nothing
says
the
elder
let
away
and
away
they
flew
like
lightning
they
had
however
sauntered
so
long
in
their
road
that
they
did
not
reach
ambleside
before
me
and
i
saw
them
go
up
to
matthew
harrison
house
with
their
wallet
upon
the
elder
shoulder
and
creeping
with
a
beggar
complaining
foot
on
my
return
through
ambleside
i
met
in
the
street
the
mother
driving
her
asses
in
the
two
panniers
of
one
of
which
were
the
two
little
children
whom
she
was
chiding
and
threatening
with
a
wand
which
she
used
to
drive
on
her
asses
while
the
little
things
hung
in
wantonness
over
the
edge
the
woman
had
told
me
in
the
morning
that
she
was
of
scotland
which
her
accent
fully
proved
but
that
she
had
lived
i
think
at
wigtoun
that
they
could
not
keep
a
house
and
so
they
travelled

heard
a
strange
sound
in
the

we
were
floating
on

water
it
in

wood
but
it
must
have
been
above
it

presently
we
saw
a
raven
very
high
above
us
it
called
out
and
the
dome
of
the
sky
seemed
to
echo
the
sound
it
called
again
and
again
as
it
flew
onwards
and
the
mountains
gave
back
the
sound
seeming
as
if
from
their
centre
a
musical
answering
to
the
bird
hoarse
voice
we
heard
both
the
call
of
the
bird

the

not
tinged

autumnal
yellow

softened

of

my
brothers
came
home

at
we
drank
tea
immediately
after
by
candlelight
it
was
a
lovely
moonlight
night
we
talked
much
about
a
house
on
helvellyn
the
moonlight
shone
only
upon
the
village
it
did
not
eclipse
the
village
lights
and
the
sound
of
dancing
and
merriment
came
along
the
still
air
i
walked
with
coleridge
and
wm
up
the
lane
and
by
the
church
and
then
lingered
with
coleridge
in
the
garden
john
and
wm
were
both
gone
to

and
all
the
lights
out
coleridge
and
john

a
funeral
at

about
men
and
women
bread

talked
sensibly
and
cheerfully
about

was
neatly
lettered
and
painted
black
and
covered
with
a
decent
cloth
they
set
the
corpse
down
at
the
door
and
while
we
stood
within
the
threshold
the
men
with
their
hats
off
sang
with
decent
and
solemn
countenances
a
verse
of
a
funeral
psalm
the
corpse
was
then
borne
down
the
hill
and
they
sang
till
they
had
passed

affected
to
tears
while
we
stood
in
the
house
the
coffin
lying
before
me
there
were
no
near
kindred
no
children
when
we
got
out
of
the
dark
house
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
prospect
looked
as
divinely
beautiful
as
i
ever
saw
it
it
seemed
more
sacred
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
and
yet
more
allied
to
human
life
the
green
fields
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
churchyard
were
as
green
as
possible
and
with
the
brightness
of
the
sunshine
looked
quite
gay
i
thought
she
was
going
to
a
quiet
spot
and
i
could
not
help
weeping
very
much
when
we
came
to
the
bridge

began
to
sing
again
and
stopped
during
four
lines
before
they
entered

grand
the
lichens

now
coming
out
afresh
i
carried
home
a
collection
in

afternoon
we
had
a
pleasant
conversation
about
the
manners
of
the
rich
avarice
inordinate
desires
and
the
effeminacy
unnaturalness
and
unworthy
objects
of

the
moonlight
lay
upon

hills
like
snow
very
rainy
all
the
morning
wm
walked
to
ambleside
after
dinner
i
went
with
him
part
of
the
way
he
talked
much
about
the
object
of
his
essay
for
the
second
volume
of
l
b
amos
cottle
death
in
the
when
william
and
i
returned
from
accompanying
jones
we
met
an
old
man
almost
double
he
had
on
a
coat
thrown
over
his
shoulders
above
his
waistcoat
and
coat
under
this
he
carried
a
bundle
and
had
an
apron
on
and
a
his
face
was
interesting
he
had
dark
eyes
and
a
long
nose
john
who
afterwards
met
him
at
wytheburn
took
him
for
a
jew
he
was
of
scotch
parents
but
had
been
born
in
the
army
he
had
had
a
wife
and
she
was
a
good
woman
and
it
pleased
god
to
bless
us
with
ten
children
all
these
were
dead
but
one
of
whom
he
had
not
heard
for
many
years
a
sailor
his
trade
was
to
gather
leeches
but
now
leeches
were
scarce
and
he
had
not
strength
for
it
he
lived
by
begging
and
was
making
his
way
to
carlisle
where
he
should
buy
a
few
godly
books
to
sell
he
said
leeches
were
very
scarce
partly
owing
to
this
dry
season
but
many
years
they
have
been
scarce
he
supposed
it
owing
to
their
being
much
sought
after
that
they
did
not
breed
fast
and
were
of
slow
growth
leeches
were
formerly
per
they
are
now
he
had
been
hurt
in
driving
a
cart
his
leg
broken
his
body
driven
over
his
skull
fractured
he
felt
no
pain
till
he
recovered
from
his
first
insensibility
it
was

late
in
the
evening
when
the
light
was

was

we
heard
the
wind
everywhere
about
us
as
we
went
along
the
lane
but
the
walls
sheltered
us
john
green
house
looked
pretty
under
silver
how
as
we
were
going
along
we
were
stopped
at
once
at
the
distance
perhaps
of
yards
from
our
favourite
birch
tree
it
was
yielding
to
the
gusty
wind
with
all
its
tender
twigs
the
sun
shone
upon
it
and
it
glanced
in
the
wind
like
a
flying
sunshiny
shower
it
was
a
tree
in
shape
with
stem
and
branches
but
it
was
like
a
spirit
of
water
the
sun
went
in
and
it
resumed
its
purplish
appearance
the
twigs
still
yielding
to
the
wind
but
not
so
visibly
to
us
the
other
birch
trees
that
were
near
it
looked
bright
and
cheerful
but
it
was
a
creature
by
its
own
self
among
them
we
went
through
the
wood
it
became
fair
there
was
a
rainbow
which
spanned
the
lake
from
the
to
the
foot
of
bainriggs
the
village
looked
populous

beautiful
catkins
are
coming
out

trees
budding
the
alder
with

we
came
home

i
went
in
to
set
her
right
about
this
and
sate
a
while
with
her
she
talked
about
thomas
having
sold
his
land
i
says
she
said
many
a
time
he
not
come
fra
london
to
buy
our
land
however
then
she
told
me
with
what
pains
and
industry

had
made
up
their
taxes

how
they
all
got
up
at

and
that
they
had
paid
off
a
hundred
pounds
of
the
interest
she
said
she
used
to
take
much
pleasure
in
the
cattle
and
sheep
o
how
pleased
i
used
to
be
when
they
fetched
them
down
and
when
i
had
been
a
bit
poorly
i
would
gang
out
upon
a
hill
and
look
fields
and
see
them
and
it
used
to
do
me
so
much
good
you

very
ill

fair
face

william

went
to
find
him
moonlight
but
it
rained
he
had
been
surprised
and
terrified
by
a
sudden
rushing
of
winds
which
seemed
to
bring
earth
sky
and
lake
together
as
if
the
whole
were
going
to
enclose
him
in

was
glad
he
was

speaking
of
our
walk
on
sunday
evening

november
i
forgot
to
notice
one
most
impressive
sight
it
was
the
moon
and
the
moonlight
seen
through
hurrying
driving
clouds
immediately
behind
the
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
on
the
forest
side
every
tooth
and
every
edge
of
rock
was
visible
and
the
man
stood
like
a
giant
watching
from
the
roof
of
a
lofty
castle
the
hill
seemed
perpendicular
from
the
darkness
below
it
it
was
a
sight
that
i
could
call
to
mind
at
any
time
it
was
so
distinct
it
was
a
showery
morning
and
threatened
to
be
a
wettish
day
but
the
sun
shone
once
or
twice
we
were
engaged
to
lloyd
and
wm
and
mary
were
determined
to
go
that
it
might
be
over
i
accompanied
them
to
the
thorn
beside
rydale
water
i
parted
from
them
first
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
they
called
me
back

rained
a
little
and
rained
afterwards
all
the
afternoon
i
baked
bread
and
wrote
to
sara
hutchinson
and
coleridge
i
passed
a
pleasant
evening
but
the
wind
roared
so
and
it
was
such
a
storm
that
i
was
afraid
for
them
they
came
in
at
nine
no
worse
for
their
walk
and
cheerful
blooming

happy
olliff
called
before
wm
was
up
to

this
afternoon

into
easedale
to
gather

to
fetch

very
fine
beautiful
sunshiny
morning
wm
worked
a
while
at
chaucer
then
we
set
forward
to
walk
into
easedale
we
walked
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
flat
field
which
makes
the
second
course
of
easedale
with
that
beautiful
rock
in
the
field
beside
us
and
all
the
rocks
and
the
woods
and
the
mountains
enclosing
us
round
the
sun
was
shining
among
them
the
snow
thinly
scattered
upon
the
tops
of
the
mountains
in
the
afternoon
we
sate
by
the
fire
i
read
chaucer
aloud
and
mary
read
the
first
canto
of
fairy
after
tea
mary
and
i
walked
to
ambleside
for
letters
it
was
a
sober
starlight
evening
the
stars
not
shining
as
it
were
with
all
their
brightness
when
they
were
visible
and
sometimes
hiding
themselves
behind
small
greying
clouds
that
passed
soberly
along
we
opened
letter
at
door
we
thought
we
saw
that
he
wrote
in
good
spirits
so
we
came
happily
homewards
where
we
arrived
hours
after
we
left
home
it
was
a
sad
melancholy
letter
and
prevented
us
all
from
sleeping
morning
we
rose
by
candlelight
a
showery
unpleasant
morning
after
a
downright
rainy
night
we
determined
however
to
go
to
keswick
if
possible
and
we
set
off
a
little
after
when
we
were
upon
the
raise
it
snowed
very
much
and
the
whole
prospect
closed
in
upon
us
like
a
moorland
valley
upon
a
moor
very
wild
but
when
we
were
at
the
top
of
the
raise
we
saw
the
mountains
before
us
the
sun
shone
upon
them
here
and
there
and
wytheburn
vale
though
wild
looked
soft
the
day
went
on
cheerfully
and
pleasantly
now
and
then
a
hail
shower
attacked
us
but
we
kept
up
a
good
heart
for
mary
is
a
famous
jockey
we
reached
greta
hall
at
about
one
met
in

mary
why
ca
i
be
his
mamma
ca
he

more
mammas
than

no
says
what
for
because
they
do
not
love
and
mothers
do
what
is
the
difference
between
mothers
and
mammas
looking
at
his
sleeves
mothers
wear
sleeves
like
this
pulling
his
own
tight
down
and
mammas
pulling
them
up
and
making
a
bustle
about
his
shoulders
so
we
parted
from
them
at
it
was
a
little
of
the
dusk
when
we
set
off
cotton
mills
lighted
up
the
first
star
at
nadel
fell
but
it
was
never
dark
we
rode
very
briskly
snow
upon
the
raise
reached
home
at
seven
william
at
work
with
chaucer
god
of

latish
i
wrote
a

to

a
dullish
rainyish
morning
wm
at

with

i
read

worked
at

and
the
till
he
was
tired

i
read
and
william
writing
out
his
alteration
of
chaucer
and
when
i
had
finished
a
letter
to
mary
and
i
walked
into
easedale
and
backwards
and
forwards
in
that
large
field
under
george
rawson
white
cottage
we
had
intended
gathering
mosses
and
for
that
purpose
we
turned
into
the
green
lane
behind
the
tailor
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
the
mosses
the
river
came
galloping
past
the
church
as
fast
as
it
could
come
and
when
we
got
into
easedale
we
saw
churn
milk
force
like
a
broad
stream
of
snow
at
the
little
we
stopped
to
look
at
the
company
of
rivers
which
came
hurrying
down
the
vale
this
way
and
that
it
was
a
valley
of
streams
and
islands
with
that
great
waterfall
at
the
head
and
lesser
falls
in
different
parts
of
the
mountains
coming
down
to
these
rivers
we
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
lesser
falls
but
we
could
not
see
them
we
walked
backwards
and
forwards
till
all
distant
objects
except
the
white
shape
of
the
waterfall
and
the
lines
of
the
mountains
were
gone
we
had
the
crescent
moon
when
we
went
out
and
at
our
return
there
were
a
few
stars
that
shone
dimly
but
it
was
a
grey
cloudy
night
we
walked
into
easedale
to
gather
mosses
and
then
we
went
up
the
gill
beyond
that
little
waterfall
it
was
a
wild
scene
of
crag
and
mountain
one
craggy
point
rose
above
the
rest
irregular
and
rugged
and
very
impressive
it
was
we
were
very
unsuccessful
in
our
search
after
mosses
just
when
the
evening
was
closing
in
clarkson
came
to
the
door
it
was
a
fine
frosty
evening
we
played
at
cards
snow
upon
the
ground
all
looked
cheerful
and
bright
helm
crag
rose
very
bold
and
craggy
a
being
by
itself
and
behind
it
was
the
large
ridge
of
mountain
smooth
as
marble
and
snow
white
all
the
mountains
looked
like
solid
stone
on
our
left
going
from
grasmere
white
moss
and
nab
scar
the
snow
hid
all
the
grass
and
all
signs
of
vegetation
and
the
rocks
showed
themselves
boldly
everywhere
and
seemed
more
stony
than
rock
or
stone
the
birches
on
the
crags
beautiful
red
brown
and
glittering
the
ashes
glittering
spears
with
their
upright
stems
the
hips
very
beautiful
and
so
good
and
dear
coleridge
i
ate
twenty
for

the
night
and
still
snowing
ambleside
looked
excessively
beautiful
as
we
came
out
like
a
village
in
another
country
and
the
light
cheerful
mountains
were
seen
in
the
long
distance
as
bright
and
as
clear
as
at
with
the
blue
sky
above
them
we
heard
waterfowl
calling
out
by
the
lake
side
jupiter

very
glorious
above
the
ambleside
hills
and

large
star
hung
over

corner
of
the
hills

the
opposite
side
of
rydale

bright
red
mosses
green
i
wrote
to
coleridge

snowed
all

was
a
very
deep
snow
the
brooms
were
very
beautiful
arched
feathers
with
wiry
stalks
pointed
to
the
end
smaller
and
smaller
they
waved
gently
with
the
weight
of
the
snow
being
the
shortest
day
mary
walked
to
ambleside
for
letters
it
was
a
wearisome
walk
for
the
snow
lay
deep
upon
the
roads
and
it
was
beginning
to
thaw
i
stayed
at
home
wm
sate
beside
me
and
read
he
was
in
good
spirits
and
full
of
hope
of
what
he
should
do
with
it
he
went
to
meet
mary
and
they
brought
four
letters
two
from
coleridge
one
from
sara
and
one
from
france
coleridge
were
melancholy
letters
he
had
been
very
we
were
made
very
unhappy
wm
wrote
to
him
and
directed
the
letter
into
somersetshire
i
finished
it
after
tea
in
the
afternoon
mary
and
i
ironed
wm
composed
a
few
lines
of
we
talked
about
lamb
tragedy
as
we
went
down
the
white
moss
we
stopped
a
long
time
in
going
to
watch
a
little
bird
with
a
breast
a
white
cross
or
t
upon
its
wings
and
a
brownish
back
with
faint
stripes
it
began
to
pick
upon
the
road
at
the
distance
of
four
yards
from
us
and
advanced
nearer
and
nearer
till
it
came
within
the
length
of
stick
without
any
apparent
fear
of
us
as
we
came
up
the
white
moss
we
met
an
old
man
who
i
saw
was
a
beggar
by
his
two
bags
hanging
over
his
shoulder
but
from
half
laziness
half
indifference
and
wanting
to
him
if
he
would
speak
i
let
him
pass
he
said
nothing
and
my
heart
smote
me
i
turned
back
and
said
you
are
begging
ay
says
he
i
gave
him
something
william
judging
from
his
appearance
joined
in
i
suppose
you
were
a
sailor
ay
he
replied
i
have
been
years
at
sea
of
them
on
board
a
under
sir
hugh
palmer
why
have
you
not
a
pension
i
have
no
pension
but
i
could
have
got
into
greenwich
hospital
but
all
my
officers
are
dead
he
was
years
of
age
had
a
freshish
colour
in
his
cheeks
grey
hair
a
decent
hat
with
a
binding
round
the
edge
the
hat
worn
brown
and
glossy
his
shoes
were
small
thin
shoes
low
in
the
quarters
pretty
good
they
had
belonged
to
a
gentleman
his
coat
was
frock
shaped
coming
over
his
thighs
it
had
been
joined
up
at
the
seams
behind
with
paler
blue
to
let
it
out
and
there
were
three
patches
of
darker
blue
behind
where
the
buttons
had
been
his
breeches
were
either
of
fustian
or
grey
cloth
with
strings
hanging
down
whole
and
tight
he
had
a
checked
shirt
on
and
a
small
coloured
handkerchief
tied
round
his
neck
his
bags
were
hung
over
each
shoulder
and
lay
on
each
side
of
him
below
his
breast
one
was
brownish
and
of
coarse
stuff
the
other
was
white
with
meal
on
the
outside
and
his
blue
waistcoat
was
whitened
with
meal
we
overtook
old
fleming
at
rydale
leading
his
little
grandchild
along
the
slippery
road
the
same
face
seemed
to
be
natural
to
them
both
the
old
man
and
the
little
child
and
they
went
hand
in
hand
the
grandfather
cautious
yet
looking
proud
of
his
charge
he
had
two
patches
of
new
cloth
at
the
of
his
faded
coat
like
eyes
at
each
shoulder
not
worn
elsewhere
i
found
mary
at
home
in
her
all
her
clothes
being
put
up
we
were
very
sad
about
coleridge
we
stopped
to
look
at
the
stone
seat
at
the
top
of
the
hill
there
was
a
white
cushion
upon
it
round
at
the
edge
like
a
cushion
and
the
rock
behind
looked
soft
as
velvet
of
a
vivid
green
and
so
tempting
the
snow
too
looked
as
soft
as
a
down
cushion
a
young
foxglove
like
a
star
in
the
centre
there
were
a
few
green
lichens
about
it
and
a
few
withered
brackens
of
fern
here
and
there
upon
the
ground
near
all
else
was
a
thick
snow
no
footmark
to
it
not
the
foot
of
a
sheep
we
sate
snugly
round
the
fire
i
read
to
them
the
tale
of
constance
and
the
syrian
monarch
in
the
of
also
some
of
the
mary
wrote
out
the
tales
from
chaucer
for
coleridge
william
worked
at
ruined
and
made
himself
very
ill
a
broken
soldier
came
to
beg
in
the
morning
afterwards
a
tall
woman
dressed
somewhat
in
a
tawdry
style
with
a
long
checked
muslin
apron
a
beaver
hat
and
throughout
what
are
called
good
clothes
her
daughter
had
gone
before
with
a
soldier
and
his
wife
she
had
buried
her
husband
at
whitehaven
and
was
going
back
into
cheshire
still
a
thaw
mary
and
i
sate
comfortably
round
the
fire
in
the
evening
and
read
chaucer
thoughts
of
last
year
i
took
out
my
old
journal
we
received
a
letter
from
coleridge
his
letter
made
us
uneasy
about
him
i
was
glad
i
was
not
by
myself
when
i
received
it
we
walked
to
rydale
grasmere
lake
a
beautiful
image
of
stillness
clear
as
glass
reflecting
all
things
the
wind
was
up
and
the
waters
sounding
the
lake
of
a
rich
purple
the
fields
a
soft
yellow
the
island
the
copses
the
mountains
purple
the
church
and
buildings
how
quiet
they
were
poor
coleridge
sara
and
dear
little
derwent
here
last
year
at
this
time
after
tea
we
sate
by
the
fire
comfortably

a
fine
soft
beautiful
mild
day
with
gleams
of
sunshine
william
went
to
take
in
his
boat
i
sate
in
john
grove
a
little
while
mary
came
home
mary
wrote
some
lines
of
the
third
part
of
his
poem
which
he
brought
to
read
to
us
when
we
came
home
of
william
mary
and
i
set
off
on
foot
to
keswick
we
carried
some
cold
mutton
in
our
pockets
and
dined
at
john
stanley
where
they
were
making
christmas
pies
the
sun
shone
but
it
was
coldish
we
parted
from
wm
upon
the
raise
he
joined
us
opposite
sara
rock
he
was
busy
in
composition
and
sate
down
upon
the
wall
we
did
not
see
him
again
till
we
arrived
at
john
stanley
there
we
roasted
apples
in
the
room
after
we
had
left
john
stanley
wm
discovered
that
he
had
lost
his
gloves
he
turned
back
but
they
were
gone
wm
rested
often
once
he
left
his
spenser
and
mary
turned
back
for
it
and
found
it
upon
the
bank
where
we
had
last
rested
we
reached
greta
hall
at
about
past
the
children
and
well
after
tea
message
came
from
wilkinson
who
had
passed
us
on
the
road
inviting
wm
to
sup
at
the
oak
he
went
met
a
young
man
a
predestined
marquis
called
johnston
he
spoke
to
him
familiarly
of
the
b
he
had
seen
a
copy
presented
by
the
queen
to
harcourt
said
he
saw
them
everywhere
and
wondered
they
did
not
sell
we
all
went
weary
to
bed
a
fine
morning
a
thin
fog
upon
the
hills
which
soon
disappeared
the
sun
shone
wilkinson
went
with
us
to
the
top
of
the
hill
we
turned
out
of
the
road
at
the
second
mile
stone
and
passed
a
pretty
cluster
of
houses
at
the
foot
of
john
vale
the
houses
were
among
tall
trees
partly
of
scotch
fir
and
some
naked
forest
trees
we
crossed
a
bridge
just
below
these
houses
and
the
river
winded
sweetly
along
the
meadows
our
road
soon
led
us
along
the
sides
of
dreary
bare
hills
but
we
had
a
glorious
prospect
to
the
left
of
saddleback
covered
with
snow
and
underneath
the
comfortable
white
houses
and
the
village
of
threlkeld
these
houses
and
the
village
want
trees
about
them
skiddaw
was
behind
us
and
dear
coleridge
desert
home
as
we
ascended
the
hills
it
grew
very
cold
and
slippery
luckily
the
wind
was
at
our
backs
and
helped
us
on
a
sharp
hail
shower
gathered
at
the
head
of
martindale
and
the
view
upwards
was
very
grand
wild
cottages
seen
through
the
hurrying
the
wind
drove
and
eddied
about
and
about
and
the
hills
looked
large
and
swelling
through
the
storm
we
thought
of
coleridge
o
the
bonny
nooks
and
windings
and
curlings
of
the
beck
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
steep
green
mossy
banks
we
dined
at
the
on
porridge
with
a
second
course
of
christmas
pies
we
were
well
received
by
the
landlady
and
her
little
jewish
daughter
was
glad
to
see
us
again
the
husband
a
very
handsome
man
while
we
were
eating
our
dinner
a
traveller
came
in
he
had
walked
over
kirkstone
that
morning
we
were
much
amused
by
the
curiosity
of
the
landlord
and
landlady
to
learn
who
he
was
and
by
his
mysterious
manner
of
letting
out
a
little
bit
of
his
errand
and
yet
telling
nothing
he
had
business
further
up
in
the
vale
he
left
them
with
this
piece
of
information
to
work
upon
and
i
doubt
not
they
discovered
who
he
was
and
all
his
business
before
the
next
day
at
that
hour
the
woman
told
us
of
the
riches
of
a
walker
formerly
of
grasmere
we
said
what
does
he
do
nothing
for
his
relations
he
has
a
sickly
sister
at
grasmere
why
said
the
man
i
daresay
if
they
had
any
sons
to
put
forward
he
would
do
it
for
them
but
he
has
children
of
his
own
his
fortune
is
above
and
he
has
two
children
the
landlord
went
about
a
mile
and
a
half
with
us
to
put
us
in
the
right
way
the
road
was
often
very
slippery
the
wind
high
and
it
was
nearly
dark
before
we
got
into
the
right
road
i
was
often
obliged
to
crawl
on
all
fours
and
mary
fell
many
a
time
a
stout
young
man
whom
we
met
on
the
hills
and
who
knew
clarkson
very
kindly
set
us
into
the
right
road
and
we
inquired
again
near
some
houses
and
were
directed
by
a
miserable
looking
woman
who
had
been
fetching
water
to
go
down
a
miry
lane
we
soon
got
into
the
main
road
and
reached
clarkson
at
tea
time
mary
spent
the
next
day
with
us
and
we
walked
on
dunmallet
before
dinner
but
it
snowed
a
little
the
day
following
being
new
year
eve
we
accompanied
mary
to
howtown
bridge
v
dorothy
wordsworth
journal
written
at
grasmere
from
january
to
july
extracts
from
dorothy
wordsworth
journal
from
january
to
july
year
we
walked
wm
and
i
towards
martindale
it
snowed
all
day
we
walked
near
to
dalemain
in
the
snow
sunday
mary
brought
us
letters
from
sara
and
coleridge
and
we
went
with
her
homewards
to
parted
at
the
stile
on
the
pooley
side
thomas
wilkinson
dined
with
us
and
stayed
supper
i
do
not
recollect
how
the
rest
of
our
time
was
spent
exactly
we
had
a
very
sharp
frost
which
broke
on
friday
the
january
or
rather
on
the
morning
of
saturday
on
sunday
the
we
went
to
meet
mary
it
was
a
mild
gentle
thaw
she
stayed
with
us
till
friday
january
on
thursday
we
dined
at
myers
and
on
friday
we
parted
from
mary
before
our
parting
we
sate
under
a
wall
in
the
sun
near
a
cottage
above
stainton
bridge
the
field
in
which
we
sate
sloped
downwards
to
a
nearly
level
meadow
round
which
the
emont
flowed
in
a
small
as
at
lochleven
the
opposite
bank
is
woody
steep
as
a
wall
but
not
high
and
above
that
bank
the
fields
slope
gently
and
irregularly
down
to
it
these
fields
are
surrounded
by
tall
hedges
with
trees
among
them
and
there
are
clumps
or
grovelets
of
tall
trees
here
and
there
sheep
and
cattle
were
in
the
fields
dear
mary
there
we
parted
from
her
i
daresay
as
often
as
she
passes
that
road
she
will
turn
in
at
the
gate
to
look
at
this
sweet
prospect
there
was
a
barn
and
i
think
two
or
three
cottages
to
be
seen
among
the
trees
and
slips
of
lawn
and
irregular
fields
during
our
stay
at
clarkson
we
walked
every
day
except
that
stormy
thursday
we
dined
at
thomas
wilkinson
on
friday
the
and
walked
to
penrith
for
mary
the
trees
were
covered
with
grasses
and
trees
and
hedges
beautiful
a
glorious
sunset
frost
keener
than
ever
next
day
thaw
clarkson
amused
us
with
many
stories
of
her
family
and
of
persons
whom
she
had
known
i
wish
i
had
set
them
down
as
i
heard
them
when
they
were
fresh
in
my
memory
clarkson
knew
a
clergyman
and
his
wife
who
brought
up
ten
children
upon
a
curacy
sent
two
sons
to
college
and
he
left
when
he
died
the
wife
was
very
generous
gave
food
and
drink
to
all
poor
people
she
had
a
passion
for
feeding
animals
she
killed
a
pig
with
feeding
it
over
much
when
it
was
dead
she
said
to
be
sure
it
a
great
loss
but
i
thank
god
it
did
not
die
the
cheshire
word
for
starved
her
husband
was
very
fond
of
playing
and
used
to
play
whenever
he
could
get
anybody
to
play
with
him
she
had
played
much
in
her
youth
and
was
an
excellent
player
but
her
husband
knew
nothing
of
this
till
one
day
she
said
to
him
you
fond
of
come
play
with
me
he
was
surprised
she
told
him
she
had
kept
it
to
herself
while
she
had
a
young
family
to
attend
to
but
that
now
she
would
play
with
him
so
they
began
to
play
and
played
every
night
told
us
many
pleasant
stories
his
journey
from
london
to
wisbeck
on
foot
when
a
schoolboy
knife
and
stick
postboy
the
white
horse
sleeping
at
the
turnpike
gate
snoring
the
turnpike
man
clock
ticking
the
burring
story
the
story
of
the
mastiff
by
men
at
wisbeck
footnote
this
refers
probably
to
loch
leven
in
argyll
but
its
point
is
not
obvious
and
dorothy
wordsworth
had
not
then
been
in
ed
on
saturday
january
we
left
eusemere
at
in
the
morning
i
behind
wm
clarkson
on
his
galloway
the
morning
not
very
promising
the
wind
cold
the
mountains
large
and
dark
but
only
thinly
streaked
with
snow
a
strong
wind
we
dined
in
grisdale
on
ham
bread
and
milk
we
parted
from
at
one
it
rained
all
the
way
home
we
struggled
with
the
wind
and
often
rested
as
we
went
along
a
hail
shower
met
us
before
we
reached
the
tarn
and
the
way
often
was
difficult
over
the
snow
but
at
the
tarn
the
view
closed
in
we
saw
nothing
but
mists
and
snow
and
at
first
the
ice
on
the
tarn
below
us
cracked
and
split
yet
without
water
a
dull
grey
white
we
lost
our
path
and
could
see
the
tarn
no
longer
we
made
our
way
out
with
difficulty
guided
by
a
heap
of
stones
which
we
well
remembered
we
were
afraid
of
being
bewildered
in
the
mists
till
the
darkness
should
overtake
us
we
were
long
before
we
knew
that
we
were
in
the
right
track
but
thanks
to
william
skill
we
knew
it
long
before
we
could
see
our
way
before
us
there
was
no
footmark
upon
the
snow
either
of
man
or
beast
we
saw
four
sheep
before
we
had
left
the
snow
region
the
vale
of
grasmere
when
the
mists
broke
away
looked
soft
and
grave
of
a
yellow
hue
it
was
dark
before
we
reached
home
o
how
happy
and
comfortable
we
felt
ourselves
sitting
by
our
own
fire
when
we
had
got
off
our
wet
clothes
we
talked
about
the
lake
of
como
read
the
description
looked
about
us
and
felt
that
we
were
happy
footnote
a
galloway
ed
we
went
into
the
orchard
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
laid
out
the
situation
for
our
new
room
and
sauntered
a
while
wm
walked
in
the
morning
i
wrote
to

tired
with
composition
we
are
going
to

i
am
ready
and
waiting
by
the
kitchen

we
set
forward
intending
to
go
into
easedale
but
the
wind
being
loudish
and
blowing
down
easedale
we
walked
under
silver
how
for
a
shelter
we
went
a
little
beyond
the
syke
then
up
to
john
grove
where
the
storm
of
thursday
has
made
sad
ravages
two
of
the
finest
trees
are
uprooted
one
lying
with
the
turf
about
its
root
as
if
the
whole
together
had
been
pared
by
a
knife
the
other
is
a
larch
several
others
are
blown
aside
one
is
snapped
in
two
we
gathered
together
a
faggot
wm
had
tired
himself
with
working
we
received
a
letter
from
mary
with
an
account
of
arrival
in
london
i
wrote
to
mary
before
bedtime
wm
wrote
out
part
of
his
poem
and
endeavoured
to
alter
it

so
made
himself
ill

and
asked
us
to
tea
we
stayed
in
the
house
till
the
sun
shone
more
dimly
and
we
thought
the
afternoon
was
closing
in
but
though
the
calmness
of
the
lake
was
gone
with
the
bright
sunshine
yet
it
was
delightfully
pleasant
we
found
no
letter
from
coleridge
one
from
sara
which
we
sate
upon
the
wall
to
read
a
sweet
long
letter
with
a
most
interesting
account
of
patrick
we
cooked
no
dinner
sate
a
while
by
the
fire
and
then
drank
tea
at
frank
raty
as
we
went
past
the
nab
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
youngest
child
amongst
them
running
about
by
itself
with
a
canny
round
fat
face
and
rosy
cheeks

closed
the
letters
up
to

we
sate
by

were

painful

to

past

in

that
sweet
mood

downright
rain
a
wet
night
wm
wrote
an
epitaph
and
altered
one
that
he
wrote
when
he
was
a
boy
it
cleared
up
after
dinner
we
were
both
in
miserable
spirits
and
very
doubtful
about
keeping
our
engagements
to
the
olliffs
we
walked
first
within
view
of
rydale
then
to
lowthwaite
then
we
went
to
olliff
we
talked
a
while
wm
was
tired
we
then
played
at
cards
came
home
in
the
rain
very
dark
came
with
a
lantern
wm
out
of
spirits
and
tired
he
called
at
past
to
know
the
hour
wm
was
very
unwell
worn
out
with
his
bad
night
rest
i
read
to
him
to
endeavour
to
make
him
sleep
then
i
came
into
the
other
room
and
i
read
the
first
book
of
after
dinner
we
walked
to
ambleside
a
letter
from
coleridge
we
were
sad
as
we
could
be
wm
wrote
to
him
we
talked
about
wm
going
to
london
it
was
a
mild
afternoon
there
was
an
unusual
softness
in
the
prospects
as
we
went
a
rich
yellow
upon
the
fields
and
a
soft
grave
purple
on
the
waters
when
we
returned
many
stars
were
out
the
clouds
were
moveless
and
the
sky
soft

behind
jupiter
at
least
call
him
but
william
says
we
always
call
the
largest
star
jupiter
when
we
came
home
we
both
wrote
to
i
was
stupefied
january
a
cold
dark
morning
william
chopped
wood
i
brought
it
in
a
basket
he
asked
me
to
set
down
the
story
of
barbara
wilkinson
turtle
dove
barbara
is
an
old
maid
she
had
two
turtle
doves
one
of
them
died
the
first
year
i
think
the
other
continued
to
live
alone
in
its
cage
for
nine
years
but
for
one
whole
year
it
had
a
companion
and
daily
visitor
a
little
mouse
that
used
to
come
and
feed
with
it
and
the
dove
would
carry
it
and
cover
it
over
with
its
wings
and
make
a
loving
noise
to
it
the
mouse
though
it
did
not
testify
equal
delight
in
the
dove
company
was
yet
at
perfect
ease
the
poor
mouse
disappeared
and
the
dove
was
left
solitary
till
its
death
it
died
of
a
short
sickness
and
was
buried
under
a
tree
with
funeral
ceremony
by
barbara
and
her
maidens
and
one
or
two
others
on
wm
worked
at
all
the
morning
he
kept
the
dinner
waiting
till
four
he
was
much
tired
wm
had
slept
very
ill
he
was
tired
we
walked
round
the
two
lakes
grasmere
was
very
soft
and
rydale
was
extremely
beautiful
from
the
western
side
nab
scar
was
just
topped
by
a
cloud
which
cutting
it
off
as
high
as
it
could
be
cut
off
made
the
mountain
look
uncommonly
lofty
we
sate
down
a
long
time
with
different
plans
i
always
love
to
walk
that
way
because
it
is
the
way
i
first
came
to
rydale
and
grasmere
and
because
our
dear
coleridge
did
also
when
i
came
with
and
years
ago
it
was
just
at
sunset
there
was
a
rich
yellow
light
on
the
waters
and
the
islands
were
reflected
there
it
was
grave
and
soft
but
not
perfectly
calm
william
says
it
was
much
such
a
day
as
when
coleridge
came
with
the
sun
shone
out
before
we
reached
grasmere
we
sate
by
the
roadside
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
close
to
mary
dear
name
which
she
had
cut
herself
upon
the
stone
wm
cut
at
it
with
his
knife
to
make
it
plainer
we
amused
ourselves
for
a
long
time
in
watching
the
breezes
some
as
if
they
came
from
the
bottom
of
the
lake
spread
in
a
circle
brushing
along
the
surface
of
the
water
and
growing
more
delicate
as
it
were
thinner
and
of
a
colour
till
they
died
away
others
spread
out
like
a
peacock
tail
and
some
went
right
forward
this
way
and
that
in
all
directions
the
lake
was
still
where
these
breezes
were
not
but
they
made
it
all
alive
i
found
a
strawberry
blossom
in
a
rock
the
little
slender
flower
had
more
courage
than
the
green
leaves
for
were
but
half
expanded
and
half
grown
but
the
blossom
was
spread
full
out
i
uprooted
it
rashly
and
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
committing
an
outrage
so
i
planted
it
again
it
will
have
but
a
stormy
life
of
it
but
let
it
live
if
it
can
we
found
calvert
here
i
brought
a
handkerchief
full
of
mosses
which
i
placed
on
the
chimneypiece
when
calvert
was
gone
he
dined
with
us
and
carried
away
the
encyclopædias
after
they
were
gone
i
spent
some
time
in
trying
to
reconcile
myself
to
the
change
and
in
rummaging
out
and
arranging
some
other
books
in
their
places
one
good
thing
is
this
there
is
a
nice
elbow
place
for
and
he
may
sit
for
the
picture
of
john
bunyan
any
day
simpson
drank
tea
with
us

our
rent

hard
at

tired
himself
there
was
a
purplish
light
upon
olliff
house
which
made
me
look
to
the
other
side
of
the
vale
when
i
saw
a
strange
stormy
mist
coming
down
the
side
of
silver
how
of
a
reddish
purple
colour
it
soon
came
on
a
heavy
rain
a
box
with
books
came
from
london
i
sate
by
bedside
and
read
in
pleasures
of
to
him
which
came
in
the
box
he
could
not
fall
asleep
wm
went
into
the
orchard
after
breakfast
to
chop
wood
we
walked
into
easedale
walked
backwards
and
forwards
between
goody
bridge
and
butterlip
how
william
wished
to
break
off
composition
but
was
unable
and
so
did
himself
harm
the
sun
shone
but
it
was
cold
william
worked
at
after
tea
i
read
aloud
the
eleventh
book
of
we
were
much
impressed
and
also
melted
into
tears
the
papers
came
in
soon
after
i
had
laid
aside
the
book
a
good
thing
for
my
wm
a
rainy
morning
we
walked
to
rydale
for
letters
found
one
from
cookson
and
mary
it
snowed
upon
the
hills
we
sate
down
on
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
white
moss
sate
by
the
fire
in
the
evening
wm
tired
and
did
not
compose
he
went
to
bed
soon
and
could
not
sleep
i
wrote
to
mary
sent
off
the
letter
by
fletcher
wrote
also
to
coleridge
read
wm
to
sleep
after
dinner
and
read
to
him
in
bed
till
past
one
wm
thought
a
little
about
read
smollet
life
a
cold
snowy
morning
snow
and
hail
showers
we
did
not
walk
wm
cut
wood
a
little
sate
up
late
at
two
very
affecting
letters
from
coleridge
resolved
to
try
another
climate
i
was
stopped
in
my
writing
and
made
ill
by
the
letters
wrote
again
after
tea
and
translated
two
or
three
of
lessing
a
fine
clear
frosty
morning
the
eaves
drop
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
all
day
long
the
ground
thinly
covered
with
snow
the
road
black
rocks
black
before
night
the
island
was
quite
green
the
sun
had
melted
all
the
snow
wm
working
at
his
poem
we
sate
by
the
fire
and
did
not
walk
but
read
thinking
it
done
but
could
find
fault
with
one
part
of
it
it
was
uninteresting
and
must
be
altered
poor
morning
february
it
was
very
windy
and
rained
hard
all
the
morning
william
worked
at
his
poem
and
i
read
a
little
in
lessing
and
the
grammar
a
chaise
came
past
after
dinner
we
set
off
at
about
past
we
went
towards
rydale
for
letters
it
was
a
the
rain
had
been
so
cold
that
it
hardly
melted
the
snow
we
stopped
at
park
to
get
some
straw
round
wm
shoes
the
young
mother
was
sitting
by
a
bright
wood
fire
with
her
youngest
child
upon
her
lap
and
the
other
two
sate
on
each
side
of
the
chimney
the
light
of
the
fire
made
them
a
beautiful
sight
with
their
innocent
countenances
their
rosy
cheeks
and
glossy
curling
hair
we
sate
and
talked
about
poor
ellis
and
our
journey
over
the
hawes
before
we
had
come
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
we
met
our
patient
friend
with
his
little
wooden
box
at
his
back
where
are
you
going
said
he
to
rydale
for
letters
i
have
two
for
you
in
my
box
we
lifted
up
the
lid
and
there
they
lay
poor
fellow
he
straddled
and
pushed
on
with
all
his
might
but
we
outstripped
him
far
away
when
we
had
turned
back
with
our
letters
i
could
not
help
comparing
lots
with
him
he
goes
at
that
slow
pace
every
morning
and
after
having
wrought
a
hard
day
work
returns
at
night
however
weary
he
may
be
takes
it
all
quietly
and
though
perhaps
he
neither
feels
thankfulness
nor
pleasure
when
he
eats
his
supper
and
has
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
falling
asleep
in
bed
yet
i
daresay
he
neither
murmurs
nor
thinks
it
hard
he
seems
mechanised
to
labour
we
broke
the
seal
of
coleridge
letters
and
i
had
light
enough
just
to
see
that
he
was
not
ill
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
at
the
top
of
the
white
moss
i
took
it
to
my
bosom
a
safer
place
for
it
the
sight
was
wild
there
was
a
strange
mountain
lightness
when
we
were
at
the
top
of
the
white
moss
i
have
often
observed
it
there
in
the
evenings
being
between
the
two
valleys
there
is
more
of
the
sky
there
than
any
other
place
it
has
a
strange
effect
sometimes
along
with
the
obscurity
of
evening
or
night
it
seems
almost
like
a
peculiar
sort
of
light
there
was
not
much
wind
till
we
came
to
john
grove
then
it
roared
right
out
of
the
grove
all
the
trees
were
tossing
about
coleridge
letter
somewhat
damped
us
it
spoke
with
less
confidence
about
france
wm
wrote
to
him
the
other
letter
was
from
montagu
with
wm
was
very
unwell
tired
when
he
had
written
he
went
to
bed
and
left
me
to
write
to
montagu
and
calvert
and
coleridge
i
had
written
in
his
letter
to
coleridge
we
wrote
to
calvert
to
beg
him
not
to
fetch
us
on
sunday
wm
left
me
with
a
little
peat
fire
it
grew
less
i
wrote
on
and
was
starved
at
i
went
to
put
my
letters
under
fletcher
door
i
never
felt
such
a
cold
night
there
was
a
strong
wind
and
it
froze
very
hard
i
gathered
together
all
the
clothes
i
could
find
for
i
durst
not
go
into
the
pantry
for
fear
of
waking
at
first
when
i
went
to
bed
i
seemed
to
be
warm
i
suppose
because
the
cold
air
which
i
had
just
left
no
longer
touched
my
body
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
mistaken
i
could
not
sleep
from
sheer
cold
i
had
baked
pies
and
bread
in
the
morning
coleridge
letter
contained
prescriptions
the
moon
came
out
suddenly
when
we
were
at
john
grove
and
a
star
or
two
besides
wm
had
slept
better
he
fell
to
work
and
made
himself
unwell
we
did
not
walk
a
funeral
came
by
of
a
poor
woman
who
had
drowned
herself
some
say
because
she
was
hardly
treated
by
her
husband
others
that
he
was
a
very
decent
respectable
man
and
but
an
indifferent
wife
however
this
was
she

only
been
married
to
him
last
whitsuntide
and
had
had
very
indifferent
health
ever
since
she
had
got
up
in
the
night
and
drowned
herself
in
the
pond
she
had
requested
to
be
buried
beside
her
mother

so

was
brought
in

hearse

was
followed
by
some
very
men
on
horseback
her
sister

in
a
chaise
and
some
others
with
her
and
a
cart
full
of
women

their
mothers
poor
body
has
been
little
thought
of
by
any
body
else
we
did
a
little
of
lessing
i
attempted
a
fable
but
my
head
ached
my
bones
were
sore
with
the
cold
of
the
day
before
and
i
was
downright
stupid
we
went
to
bed
but
not
till
wm
had
tired
himself
a
very
snowy
morning
i
was
writing
out
the
poem
as
we
hoped
for
a
final
writing
we
read
the
first
part
and
were
delighted
with
it
but
wm
afterwards
got
to
some
ugly
place
and
went
to
bed
tired
out
a
wild
moonlight
night
wm
sadly
tired
and
working
at
we
made
up
a
good
fire
after
dinner
and
wm
brought
his
mattress
out
and
lay
down
on
the
floor
i
read
to
him
the
life
of
ben
jonson
and
some
short
poems
of
his
which
were
too
interesting
for
him
and
would
not
let
him
go
to
sleep
i
had
begun
with
fletcher
but
he
was
too
dull
for
me
fuller
says
in
his
of
speaking
of
his
plays
if
his
latter
be
not
so
spriteful
and
vigorous
as
his
first
pieces
all
that
are
old
and
all
who
desire
to
be
old
should
excuse
him
therein
he
says
he
beheld
between
shakespeare
and
jonson
and
compares
shakespeare
to
an
english
jonson
to
a
great
spanish
galleon
there
is
one
affecting
line
in
jonson
epitaph
on
his
first
daughter
here
lies
to
each
her
parents
ruth
mary
the
daughter
of
their
youth
at
six
months
end
she
parted
hence
in
safety
of
her
innocence
two
beggars
i
continued
to
read
to
wm
we
were
much
delighted
with
the
poem
of
wm
rose
better
i
was
cheerful
and
happy
he
got
to
work
again
footnote
by
ben
ed
a
very
fine
bright
clear
hard
frost
wm
working
again
i
recopied
but
poor
wm
all
the
time
at
work
in
the
afternoon
a
poor
woman
came
she
said
to
beg
but
she
has
been
used
to
go
for
she
has
often
come
here
her
father
lived
to
the
age
of
she
is
a
woman
of
strong
bones
with
a
complexion
that
has
been
beautiful
and
remained
very
fresh
last
year
but
now
she
looks
broken
and
her
little
boy
a
pretty
little
fellow
and
whom
i
have
loved
for
the
sake
of
basil
looks
thin
and
pale
i
observed
this
to
her
aye
says
she
we
have
all
been
our
house
was
nearly
unroofed
in
the
storm
and
we
lived
in
it
so
for
more
than
a
week
the
child
wears
a
ragged
drab
coat
and
a
fur
cap
poor
little
fellow
i
think
he
seems
scarcely
at
all
grown
since
the
first
time
i
saw
him
william
was
with
me
when
we
met
him
in
a
lane
going
to
skelwith
bridge
he
looked
very
pretty
he
was
walking
lazily
in
the
deep
narrow
lane
overshadowed
with
the
hedgerows
his
meal
poke
hung
over
his
shoulder
he
said
he
was
going
a
laiting
poor
creature
he
now
wears
the
same
coat
he
had
on
at
that
time
when
the
woman
was
gone
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
we
are
not
half
thankful
enough
that
we
are
placed
in
that
condition
of
life
in
which
we
are
we
do
not
so
often
bless
god
for
this
as
we
wish
for
this
that
etc
etc
we
have
not
however
to
reproach
ourselves
with
ever
breathing
a
murmur
this
woman
was
but
a
common
case
the
snow
still
lies
upon
the
ground
just
at
the
closing
in
of
the
day
i
heard
a
cart
pass
the
door
and
at
the
same
time
the
dismal
sound
of
a
crying
infant
i
went
to
the
window
and
had
light
enough
to
see
that
a
man
was
driving
a
cart
which
seemed
not
to
be
very
full
and
that
a
woman
with
an
infant
in
her
arms
was
following
close
behind
and
a
dog
close
to
her
it
was
a
wild
and
melancholy
sight
wm
rubbed
his
tables
after
candles
were
lighted
and
we
sate
a
long
time
with
the
windows
unclosed
and
almost
finished
writing
but
poor
wm
wore
himself
out
and
me
out
with
labour
we
had
an
affecting
conversation
went
to
bed
at
it
snowed
a
little
this
morning
still
at
work
at
altering
and
refitting
we
did
not
walk
though
it
was
a
very
fine
day
we
received
a
present
of
eggs
and
milk
from
janet
dockeray
and
just
before
she
went
the
little
boy
from
the
hill
brought
us
a
letter
from
sara
and
one
from
the
frenchman
in
london
i
wrote
to
sara
after
tea
and
wm
took
out
his
old
newspapers
and
the
new
ones
came
in
soon
after
we
sate
after
i
had
finished
the
letter
talking
and
wm
read
parts
of
his
aloud
to
me
a
fine
morning
the
sun
shines
out
but
it
has
been
a
hard
frost
in
the
night
there
are
some
little
snowdrops
that
are
afraid
to
put
their
white
heads
quite
out
and
a
few
blossoms
of
hepatica
that
are
wm
left
me
at
work
altering
some
passages
of
and
went
into
the
orchard
the
fine
day
pushed
him
on
to
resolve
and
as
soon
as
i
had
read
a
letter
to
him
which
i
had
just
received
from
clarkson
he
said
he
would
go
to
penrith
so
molly
was
despatched
for
the
horse
i
worked
hard
got
the
writing
finished
and
all
quite
trim
i
wrote
to
clarkson
and
put
up
some
letters
for
mary
and
off
he
went
in
his
blue
spencer
and
a
pair
of
new
pantaloons
fresh
from
london
i
then
sate
over
the
fire
reading
ben
jonson
and
other
things
before
sunset
i
put
on
my
shawl
and
walked
out
the
mountains
were
spotted
with
rich
sunlight
a
palish
buffish
colour
i
stood
at
the
and
when
i
came
in
view
of
rydale
i
cast
a
long
look
upon
the
mountains
beyond
they
were
very
white
but
i
concluded
that
wm
would
have
a
very
safe
passage
over
kirkstone
and
i
was
quite
easy
about
him
after
dinner
a
little
before
sunset
i
walked
out
about
yards
above
rock
i
met
a
carman
a
highlander
i
suppose
with
four
carts
the
first
three
belonging
to
himself
the
last
evidently
to
a
man
and
his
family
who
had
joined
company
with
him
and
who
i
guessed
to
be
potters
the
carman
was
cheering
his
horses
and
talking
to
a
little
lass
about
ten
years
of
age
who
seemed
to
make
him
her
companion
she
ran
to
the
wall
and
took
up
a
large
stone
to
support
the
wheel
of
one
of
his
carts
and
ran
on
before
with
it
in
her
arms
to
be
ready
for
him
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
and
there
was
something
uncommonly
impressive
in
the
lightness
and
joyousness
of
her
manner
her
business
seemed
to
be
all
pleasure
pleasure
in
her
own
motions
and
the
man
looked
at
her
as
if
he
too
was
pleased
and
spoke
to
her
in
the
same
tone
in
which
he
spoke
to
his
horses
there
was
a
wildness
in
her
whole
figure
not
the
wildness
of
a
mountain
lass
but
of
the
road
lass
a
traveller
from
her
birth
who
had
wanted
neither
food
nor
clothes
her
mother
followed
the
last
cart
with
a
lovely
child
perhaps
about
a
year
old
at
her
back
and
a
girl
about
fifteen
years
old
walked
beside
her
all
the
children
were
like
the
mother
she
had
a
very
fresh
complexion
but
she
was
blown
with
fagging
up
the
steep
hill
and
with
what
she
carried
her
husband
was
helping
the
horse
to
drag
the
cart
up
by
pushing
it
with
his
shoulder
i
reached
home
and
read
german
till
about
i
wrote
to
coleridge
went
to
bed
at
about
i
slept
badly
for
my
thoughts
were
full
of
wm
it
snowed
a
good
deal
and
was
terribly
cold
after
dinner
it
was
fair
but
i
was
obliged
to
run
all
the
way
to
the
foot
of
the
white
moss
to
get
the
least
bit
of
warmth
into
me
i
found
a
letter
from
he
was
much
better
this
was
very
satisfactory
but
his
letter
was
not
an
answer
to
wm
which
i
expected
a
letter
from
annette
i
got
tea
when
i
reached
home
and
then
set
on
reading
german
i
wrote
part
of
a
letter
to
coleridge
went
to
bed
and
slept
badly
a
fine
morning
but
i
had
persuaded
myself
not
to
expect
i
believe
because
i
was
afraid
of
being
disappointed
i
ironed
all
day
he
came
just
at
tea
time
had
only
seen
mary
for
a
couple
of
hours
between
eamont
bridge
and
hartshorn

he
had
had
a
difficult
journey
over
kirkstone
and
came
home
by
threlkeld
we
spent
a
sweet
evening
he
was
better
had
altered
we
went
to
bed
pretty
soon
graham
said
he
wished
wm
had
been
with
him
the
other
day
he
was
riding
in
a
and
he
heard
a
strange
cry
that
he
could
not
understand
the
sound
continued
and
he
called
to
the
chaise
driver
to
stop
it
was
a
little
girl
that
was
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
burst
she
had
got
up
behind
the
chaise
and
her
cloak
had
been
caught
by
the
wheel
and
was
jammed
in
and
it
hung
there
she
was
crying
after
it
poor
thing
graham
took
her
into
the
chaise
and
her
cloak
was
released
from
the
wheel
but
the
child
misery
did
not
cease
for
her
cloak
was
torn
to
rags
it
had
been
a
miserable
cloak
before
but
she
had
no
other
and
it
was
the
greatest
sorrow
that
could
befall
her
her
name
was
alice
fell
she
had
no
parents
and
belonged
to
the
next
town
at
the
next
town
left
money
with
some
respectable
people
in
the
town
to
buy
her
a
new
cloak

rapid
flow

at

of

how
long
it
had
been
perched
on

voice

while

the

brighter

the
woods

frosty
sunny
morning

sitting
in
the
open
field
upon
his
pack
of
rags
the
old
ragman
that
i
know
his
coat
is
of
scarlet
in
a
thousand
patches
when
i
came
home
molly
had
shook
the
carpet
and
cleaned
everything
upstairs
when
i
see
her
so
happy
in
her
work
and
exulting
in
her
own
importance
i
often
think
of
that
affecting
expression
which
she
made
use
of
to
me
one
evening
lately
talking
of
her
good
luck
in
being
in
this
house
aye
mistress
them
low
laid

have
been
proud
creatures
could
they
but

be
my
doom
i
was
tired
when

how
glad
i

after

about
an
hour
i
gave
him
his
dinner
we
sate
talking
and
happy
he
brought
two
new
stanzas
of
a
soft
rain
and
mist
we
walked
to
rydale
for
letters
the
vale
looked
very
beautiful
in
excessive
simplicity
yet
at
the
same
time
in
uncommon
obscurity
the
church
stood
alone
mountains
behind
the
meadows
looked
calm
and
rich
bordering
on
the
still
lake
nothing
else
to
be
seen
but
lake
and
island
on
friday
evening
the
moon
hung
over
the
northern
side
of
the
highest
point
of
silver
how
like
a
gold
ring
snapped
in
two
and
shaven
off
at
the
ends
within
this
ring
lay
the
circle
of
the
round
moon
as
distinctly
to
be
seen
as
ever
the
enlightened
moon
is
william
had
observed
the
same
appearance
at
keswick
perhaps
at
the
very
same
moment
hanging
over
the
newland
fells
sent
off
a
letter
to
mary
also
to
coleridge
and
sara
and
rewrote
in
the
evening
the
alterations
of
which
we
sent
off
at
the
same
time
william
was
reading
in
ben
jonson
he
read
me
a
beautiful
poem
on
love
we
sate
by
the
fire
in
the
evening
and
read
over
william
worked
a
little
and
altered
it
in
a
few
places
wm
read
in
ben
jonson
in
the
morning
i
read
a
little
german
we
then
walked
to
rydale
no
letters
they
are
slashing
away
in
benson
wood
william
has
since
tea
been
talking
about
publishing
the
yorkshire
wolds
poem
with
a
fine
morning
william
worked
at
the
poem
of
singing
just
as
we
were
sitting
down
to
dinner
we
heard
clarkson
voice
i
ran
down
william
followed
he
was
so
finely
mounted
that
william
was
more
intent
upon
the
horse
than
the
rider
an
offence
easily
forgiven
for
clarkson
was
as
proud
of
it
himself
as
he
well
could
be
footnote
first
published
in
under
the
title
of
sailor
ed
a
very
fine
morning
we
went
to
see
clarkson
off
the
sun
shone
while
it
rained
and
the
stones
of
the
walls
and
the
pebbles
on
the
road
glittered
like
silver
william
finished
his
poem
of
singing
in
the
meantime
i
read
the
remainder
of
lessing
in
the
evening
after
tea
william
wrote
he
went
to
bed
tired
with
a
wakeful
mind
and
a
weary
body
it
was
as
cold
as
ever
it
has
been
all
winter
very
hard
frost
william
finished
and
then
wrote
the
poem
of
beggar
taken
from
a
woman
whom
i
had
seen
in
may
now
nearly
two
years
ago
when
john
and
he
were
at
gallow
hill
i
sate
with
him
at
intervals
all
the
morning
took
down
his
stanzas
etc
after
tea
i
read
to
william
that
account
of
the
little
boy
belonging
to
the
tall
woman
and
an
unlucky
thing
it
was
for
he
could
not
escape
from
those
very
words
and
so
he
could
not
write
the
poem
he
left
it
unfinished
and
went
tired
to
bed
in
our
walk
from
rydale
he
had
got
warmed
with
the
subject
and
had
half
cast
the
poem
william
got
up
at
nine
but
before
he
rose
he
had
finished
beggar
and
while
we
were
at
breakfast
he
wrote
the
poem
a
he
ate
not
a
morsel
but
sate
with
his
shirt
neck
unbuttoned
and
his
waistcoat
open
while
he
did
it
the
thought
first
came
upon
him
as
we
were
talking
about
the
pleasure
we
both
always
felt
at
the
sight
of
a
butterfly
i
told
him
that
i
used
to
chase
them
a
little
but
that
i
was
afraid
of
brushing
the
dust
off
their
wings
and
did
not
catch
them
he
told
me
how
he
used
to
kill
all
the
white
ones
when
he
went
to
school
because
they
were
frenchmen
i
wrote
it
down
and
the
other
poems
and
i
read
them
all
over
to
him
william
began
to
try
to
alter
and
tired
himself
we
sate
reading
the
poems
and
i
read
a
little
german
during
absence
a
sailor
who
was
travelling
from
liverpool
to
whitehaven
called
he
was
faint
and
pale
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
a
young
man
very
well
dressed
we
sate
by
the
kitchen
fire
talking
with
him
for
two
hours
he
told
us
interesting
stories
of
his
life
his
name
was
isaac
chapel
he
had
been
at
sea
since
he
was
years
old

was
by

to
the
coast
of
guinea
he
had
been
on
board
a
slave
ship
the
captain
name

where
one
man
had
been
killed
a
boy

to
lodge
with
the
pigs
and
was
half
eaten

to
watch
in
the
hot
sun
till
he
dropped
down
dead

had
been
away
in
north
america
and
had
travelled
thirty
days
among
the
indians
where
he
had
been
well
treated
he
had
twice
swam
from
a
king
ship
in
the
night
and
escaped
he
said
he
would

now

to
wait
in
england
to
appear
against
captain
maxwell
o
he
a
rascal

wo
you
then
i
ca
help
it
he
was
excessively
like
my
brother
john
william
went
up
into
the
orchard
and
wrote
a
part
of
emigrant
after
dinner
i
read
him
to
sleep
i
read
spenser
we
walked
to
look
at
rydale
the
moon
was
a
good
height
above
the
mountains
she
seemed
far
distant
in
the
sky
there
were
two
stars
beside
her
that
twinkled
in
and
out
and
seemed
almost
like
butterflies
in
motion
and
lightness
they
looked
to
be
far
nearer
to
us
than
the
moon
william
went
up
into
the
orchard
and
finished
the
poem
i
went
and
sate
with
and
walked
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
orchard
till
dinner
time
he
read
me
his
poem
i
read
to
him
and
my
beloved
slept
a
sweet
evening
as
it
had
been
a
sweet
day
and
i
walked
quietly
along
the
side
of
rydale
lake
with
quiet
thoughts
the
hills
and
the
lake
were
still
the
owls
had
not
begun
to
hoot
and
the
little
birds
had
given
over
singing
i
looked
before
me
and
saw
a
red
light
upon
silver
how
as
if
coming
out
of
the
vale
below
there
was
a
light
of
most
strange
birth
a
light
that
came
out
of
the
earth
and
spread
along
the
dark
thus
i
was
going
on
when
i
saw
the
shape
of
my
beloved
in
the
road
at
a
little
distance
we
turned
back
to
see
the
light
but
it
was
fading
almost
gone
the
owls
hooted
when
we
sate
on
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
white
moss
the
sky
broke
more
and
more
and
we
saw
the
moon
now
and
then
john
gill
passed
us
with
his
cart
we
sate
on
when
we
came
in
sight
of
our
own
dear
grasmere
the
vale
looked
fair
and
quiet
in
the
moonshine
the
church
was
there
and
all
the
cottages
there
were
huge
clouds
in
the
sky
that
threw
large
masses
of
shade
upon
some
of
the
mountains
we
walked
backwards
and
forwards
between
home
and
olliff
till
i
was
tired
william
kindled
and
began
to
write
the
poem
we
carried
cloaks
into
the
orchard
and
sate
a
while
there
i
left
him
and
he
nearly
finished
the
poem
i
was
tired
to
death
and
went
to
bed
before
him
he
came
down
to
me
and
read
the
poem
to
me
in
bed
a
sailor
begged
here
going
to
glasgow
he
spoke
cheerfully
in
a
sweet
tone
rydale
vale
was
full
of
life
and
motion
the
wind
blew
briskly
and
the
lake
was
covered
all
over
with
bright
silver
waves
that
were
there
each
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
then
others
rose
up
and
took
their
place
as
fast
as
they
went
away
the
rocks
glittered
in
the
sunshine
the
crows
and
the
ravens
were
busy
and
the
thrushes
and
little
birds
sang
i
went
through
the
fields
and
sate
for
an
hour
afraid
to
pass
a
cow
the
cow
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
the
cow
and
whenever
i
stirred
the
cow
gave
over
eating
a
parcel
came
in
from
birmingham
with
lamb
play
for
us
and
for
c
as
we
came
along
ambleside
vale
in
the
twilight
it
was
a
grave
evening
there
was
something
in
the
air
that
compelled
me
to
various
thoughts
the
hills
were
large
closed
in
by
the
sky
night
was
come
on
and
the
moon
was
overcast
but
as
i
climbed
the
moss
the
moon
came
out
from
behind
a
mountain
mass
of
black
clouds
o
the
unutterable
darkness
of
the
sky
and
the
earth
below
the
moon
and
the
glorious
brightness
of
the
moon
itself
there
was
a
vivid
sparkling
streak
of
light
at
this
end
of
rydale
water
but
the
rest
was
very
dark
and
loughrigg
fell
and
silver
how
were
white
and
bright
as
if
they
were
covered
with
hoar
frost
the
moon
retired
again
and
appeared
and
disappeared
several
times
before
i
reached
home
once
there
was
no
moonlight
to
be
seen
but
upon
the
and
the
promontory
of
the
island
where
it
stands
that
needs
must
be
a
holy
place
etc
etc
i
had
many
very
exquisite
feelings
and
when
i
saw
this
lofty
building
in
the
waters
among
the
dark
and
lofty
hills
with
that
bright
soft
light
upon
it
it
made
me
more
than
half
a
poet
i
was
tired
when
i
reached
home
and
could
not
sit
down
to
reading
i
tried
to
write
verses
but
alas
i
gave
up
expecting
william
and
went
soon
to
bed
a
very
rainy
morning
i
went
up
into
the
lane
to
collect
a
few
green
mosses
to
make
the
chimney
gay
against
my
darling
return
poor
i
did
not
wish
for
or
expect
him
it
rained
so
coleridge
came
in
his
eyes
were
a
little
swollen
with
the
wind
i
was
much
affected
by
the
sight
of
him
he
seemed
william
came
in
soon
after
coleridge
went
to
bed
late
and
william
and
i

covered
with
snow
william
and
coleridge

a
little
talk
about

over
a
leaf

a
beautiful
spring

and

william
walked
down
with
calvert
and
repeated
his
verses
to
them
we
came
to
eusemere
coleridge
walked
with
us
to
threlkeld
the
ground
covered
with
snow
walked
to
wilkinson
and
sent
for
letters
the
woman
brought
me
one
from
william
and
mary
it
was
a
sharp
windy
night
thomas
wilkinson
came
with
me
to
barton
and
questioned
me
like
a
catechiser
all
the
way
every
question
was
like
the
snapping
of
a
little
thread
about
my
heart
i
was
so
full
of
thought
of
my
letter
and
other
things
i
was
glad
when
he
left
me
then
i
had
time
to
look
at
the
moon
while
i
was
thinking
my
own
thoughts
the
moon
travelled
through
the
clouds
tinging
them
yellow
as
she
passed
along
with
two
stars
near
her
one
larger
than
the
other
these
stars
grew
and
diminished
as
they
passed
from
or
went
into
the
clouds
at
this
time
william
as
i
found
the
next
day
was
riding
by
himself
between
middleham
and
barnard
castle
waked
me
from
sleep
with
a
letter
from
coleridge
i
walked
along
the
lake
side
the
air
was
become
still
the
lake
was
of
a
bright
slate
colour
the
hills
darkening
the
bays
shot
into
the
low
fading
shores
sheep
resting
all
things
quiet
when
i
returned
was
come
the
surprise
shot
through
me
it
was
a
threatening
misty
morning
but
mild
we
set
off
after
dinner
from
eusemere
clarkson
went
a
short
way
with
us
but
turned
back
the
wind
was
furious
and
we
thought
we
must
have
returned
we
first
rested
in
the
large
boathouse
then
under
a
furze
bush
opposite
clarkson
saw
the
plough
going
in
the
field
the
wind
seized
our
breath
the
lake
was
rough
there
was
a
boat
by
itself
floating
in
the
middle
of
the
bay
below
water
millock
we
rested
again
in
the
water
millock
lane
the
hawthorns
are
black
and
green
the
birches
here
and
there
greenish
but
there
is
yet
more
of
purple
to
be
seen
on
the
twigs
we
got
over
into
a
field
to
avoid
some
cows
people
working
a
few
primroses
by
the
roadside
woodsorrel
flower
the
anemone
scentless
violets
strawberries
and
that
starry
yellow
flower
which
calls
pile
wort
when
we
were
in
the
woods
beyond
gowbarrow
park
we
saw
a
few
daffodils
close
to
the
we
fancied
that
the
sea
had
floated
the
seeds
ashore
and
that
the
little
colony
had
so
sprung
up
but
as
we
went
along
there
were
more
and
yet
more
and
at
last
under
the
boughs
of
the
trees
we
saw
that
there
was
a
long
belt
of
them
along
the
shore
about
the
breadth
of
a
country
turnpike
road
i
never
saw
daffodils
so
beautiful
they
grew
among
the
mossy
stones
about
and
above
them
some
rested
their
heads
upon
these
stones
as
on
a
pillow
for
weariness
and
the
rest
tossed
and
reeled
and
danced
and
seemed
as
if
they
verily
laughed
with
the
wind
that
blew
upon
them
over
the
lake
they
looked
so
gay
ever
glancing
ever
changing
this
wind
blew
directly
over
the
lake
to
them
there
was
here
and
there
a
little
knot
and
a
few
stragglers
higher
up
but
they
were
so
few
as
not
to
disturb
the
simplicity
unity
and
life
of
that
one
busy
highway
we
rested
again
and
again
the
bays
were
stormy
and
we
heard
the
waves
at
different
distances
and
in
the
middle
of
the
water
like
the
sea
all
was
cheerless
and
gloomy
so
we
faced
the
storm
at
dobson
i
was
very
kindly
treated
by
a
young
woman
the
landlady
looked
sour
but
it
is
her
way
william
was
sitting
by
a
good
fire
when
i
came
downstairs
he
soon
made
his
way
to
the
library
piled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
window
he
brought
out
a
volume
of
enfield
another
miscellany
and
an
odd
volume
of
congreve
plays
we
had
a
glass
of
warm
rum
and
water
we
enjoyed
ourselves
and
wished
for
mary
it
rained
and
blew
when
we
went
to
bed
when
i
undrew
curtains
in
the
morning
i
was
much
affected
by
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
and
the
change
the
sun
shone
the
wind
had
passed
away
the
hills
looked
cheerful
the
river
was
very
bright
as
it
flowed
into
the
lake
the
church
rises
up
behind
a
little
knot
of
rocks
the
steeple
not
so
high
as
an
ordinary
house
trees
in
a
row
in
the
garden
under
the
wall
the
valley
is
at
first
broken
by
little
woody
knolls
that
make
retiring
places
fairy
valleys
in
the
vale
the
river
winds
along
under
these
hills
travelling
not
in
a
bustle
but
not
slowly
to
the
lake
we
saw
a
fisherman
in
the
flat
meadow
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
he
came
towards
us
and
threw
his
line
over
the
bridge
it
is
a
bridge
of
a
heavy
construction
almost
bending
inwards
in
the
middle
but
it
is
grey
and
there
is
a
look
of
ancientry
in
the
architecture
of
it
that
pleased
me
as
we
go
on
the
vale
opens
out
more
into
one
vale
with
somewhat
of
a
cradle
bed
cottages
with
groups
of
trees
on
the
side
of
the
hills
we
passed
a
pair
of
twin
children
two
years
old
sate
on
the
next
bridge
which
we
crossed
a
single
arch
we
rested
again
upon
the
turf
and
looked
at
the
same
bridge
we
observed
arches
in
the
water
occasioned
by
the
large
stones
sending
it
down
in
two
streams
a
sheep
came
plunging
through
the
river
stumbled
up
the
bank
and
passed
close
to
us
it
had
been
frightened
by
an
insignificant
little
dog
on
the
other
side
its
fleece
dropped
a
glittering
shower
under
its
belly
primroses
by
the
pile
wort
that
shone
like
stars
of
gold
in
the
sun
violets
strawberries
retired
and
among
the
grass
when
we
came
to
the
foot
of
brothers
water
i
left
william
sitting
on
the
bridge
and
went
along
the
path
on
the
right
side
of
the
lake
through
the
wood
i
was
delighted
with
what
i
saw
the
water
under
the
boughs
of
the
bare
old
trees
the
simplicity
of
the
mountains
and
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
path
there
was
one
grey
cottage
i
repeated
as
i
walked
along
i
hung
over
the
gate
and
thought
i
could
have
stayed
for
ever
when
i
returned
i
found
william
writing
a
poem
descriptive
of
the
sights
and
sounds
we
saw
and
heard
there
was
the
gentle
flowing
of
the
stream
the
glittering
lively
lake
green
fields
without
a
living
creature
to
be
seen
on
them
behind
us
a
flat
pasture
with
cattle
feeding
to
our
left
the
road
leading
to
the
hamlet
no
smoke
there
the
sun
shone
on
the
bare
roofs
the
people
were
at
work
ploughing
harrowing
and
sowing
a
dog
barking
now
and
then
cocks
crowing
birds
twittering
the
snow
in
patches
at
the
top
of
the
highest
hills
yellow
palms
purple
and
green
twigs
on
the
birches
ashes
with
their
glittering
stems
quite
bare
the
hawthorn
a
bright
green
with
black
stems
under
the
oak
the
moss
of
the
oak
glossy
we
went
on
passed
two
sisters
at
work
they
first
passed
us
one
with
two
pitchforks
in
her
hand
the
other
had
a
spade
we
had
come
to
talk
with
them
they
laughed
long
after
we
were
gone
perhaps
half
in
wantonness
half
boldness
william
finished
his
poem
before
we
got
to
the
foot
of
kirkstone
there
were
hundreds
of
cattle
in
the
vale
there
we
ate
our
dinner
the
walk
up
kirkstone
was
very
interesting
the
becks
among
the
rocks
were
all
alive
william
showed
me
the
little
mossy
streamlet
which
he
had
before
loved
when
he
saw
its
bright
green
track
in
the
snow
the
view
above
ambleside
very
beautiful
there
we
sate
and
looked
down
on
the
green
vale
we
watched
the
crows
at
a
little
distance
from
us
become
white
as
silver
as
they
flew
in
the
sunshine
and
when
they
went
still
further
they
looked
like
shapes
of
water
passing
over
the
green
fields
the
whitening
of
ambleside
church
is
a
great
deduction
from
the
beauty
of
it
seen
from
this
point
we
called
at
the
luffs
the
roddingtons
there
did
not
go
in
and
went
round
by
the
fields
i
pulled
off
my
stockings
intending
to
wade
the
beck
but
i
was
obliged
to
put
them
on
and
we
climbed
over
the
wall
at
the
bridge
the
post
passed
us
no
letters
rydale
lake
was
in
its
own
evening
brightness
the
island
and
points
distinct
jane
ashburner
came
up
to
us
when
we
were
sitting
upon
the
wall
the
garden
looked
pretty
in
the
as
we
went
up
the
vale

in
the
garden

the
morning

little

still
the
sheep
on

reflected
in
the
water
like
the
we
saw
in
gowbarrow
park
we
walked
after
tea
by
moonlight
i
had
been
in
bed
in
the
afternoon
and
william
had
slept
in
his
chair
we
walked
towards
rydale
backwards
and
forwards
below
olliff
the
village
was
beautiful
in
the
moonlight
helm
crag
we
observed
very
distinct
the
dead
hedge
round
benson
field
bound
together
at
the
top
by
an
interlacing
of
ash
sticks
which
made
a
chain
of
silver
when
we
faced
the
moon
a
letter
from
and
also
one
from
i
saw
a
robin
chasing
a
scarlet
butterfly
this
morning
again
a
mild
grey
morning
with
rising
vapours
we
sate
in
the
orchard
william
wrote
the
poem
on
robin
and
the
william
met
me
at
rydale
with
the
conclusion
of
the
poem
of
the
robin
i
read
it
to
him
in
bed
we
left
out
some
lines

was
quite
out
of
spirits
and
went
into
the
orchard
when
i
came
in
he
had
finished
the
poem
it
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
the
sun
shone
upon
the
level
fields
and
they
grew
greener
beneath
the
eye
houses
village
all
cheerful
people
at
work
we
sate
in
the
orchard
and
repeated
and
other
poems
just
when
william
came
to
a
well
or
trough
which
there
is
in
lord
darlington
park
he
began
to
write
that
poem
of
interrupted
in
going
through
the
town
of
staindrop
finished
it
about
miles
and
a
half
beyond
staindrop
he
did
not
feel
the
jogging
of
the
horse
while
he
was
writing
but
when
he
had
done
he
felt
the
effect
of
it
and
his
fingers
were
cold
with
his
gloves
his
horse
fell
with
him
on
the
other
side
of
helens
auckland
so
much
for
it
was
written
coming
from
middleham
on
monday
april
on
tuesday
when
we
were
sitting
after
tea
coleridge
came
to
the
door
i
startled
him
with
my
voice
came
up
fatigued
but
i
afterwards
found
he
looked
well
william
was
not
well
and
i
was
in
low
spirits
william
and
i
sauntered
a
little
in
the
garden
coleridge
came
to
us
and
repeated
the
verses
he
wrote
to
sara
i
was
affected
with
them
and
in
miserable
spirits
the
sunshine
the
green
fields
and
the
fair
sky
made
me
sadder
even
the
little
happy
sporting
lambs
seemed
but
sorrowful
to
me
the
pile
wort
spread
out
on
the
grass
a
thousand
shiny
stars
the
primroses
were
there
and
the
remains
of
a
few
daffodils
the
well
which
we
cleaned
out
last
night
is
still
but
a
little
muddy
pond
though
full
of
water
read
ferguson
life
and
a
poem
or
two
footnote
can
these
verses
have
been
the
first
draft
of
an
in
its
earliest
and
afterwards
abandoned
form
it
is
said
to
have
been
written
on
april
ed
a
fine
mild
morning
we
walked
into
easedale
the
sun
shone
coleridge
talked
of
his
plan
of
sowing
the
laburnum
in
the
woods
the
waters
were
high
for
there
had
been
a
great
quantity
of
rain
in
the
night
i
was
tired
and
sate
under
the
shade
of
a
holly
tree
that
grows
upon
a
rock
and
looked
down
the
stream
i
then
went
to
the
single
holly
behind
that
single
rock
in
the
field
and
sate
upon
the
grass
till
they
came
from
the
waterfall
i
saw
them
there
and
heard
william
flinging
stones
into
the
river
whose
roaring
was
loud
even
where
i
was
when
they
returned
william
was
repeating
the
poem
i
have
thoughts
that
are
fed
by
the
sun
it
had
been
called
to
his
mind
by
the
dying
away
of
the
stunning
of
the
waterfall
when
he
got
behind
a
stone
april
it
being
a
beautiful
morning
we
set
off
at
intending
to
stay
out
of
doors
all
the
morning
we
went
towards
rydale
and
before
we
got
to
tom
dawson
we
determined
to
go
under
nab
scar
thither
we
went
the
sun
shone
and
we
were
lazy
coleridge
pitched
upon
several
places
to
sit
down
upon
but
we
could
not
be
all
of
one
mind
respecting
sun
and
shade
so
we
pushed
on
to
the
foot
of
the
scar
it
was
very
grand
when
we
looked
up
very
stony
here
and
there
a
budding
tree
william
observed
that
the
umbrella
yew
tree
that
breasts
the
wind
had
lost
its
character
as
a
tree
and
had
become
something
like
to
solid
wood
coleridge
and
i
pushed
on
before
we
left
william
sitting
on
the
stones
feasting
with
silence
and
coleridge
and
i
sat
down
upon
a
rocky
seat
a
couch
it
might
be
under
the
bower
of
william
eglantine
andrew
broom
he
was
below
us
and
we
could
see
him
he
came
to
us
and
repeated
his
poems
while
we
sate
beside
him
upon
the
ground
he
had
made
himself
a
seat
in
the
crumbling
ground
afterwards
we
lingered
long
looking
into
the
vales
ambleside
vale
with
the
copses
the
village
under
the
hill
and
the
green
fields
rydale
with
a
lake
all
alive
and
glittering
yet
but
little
stirred
by
breezes
and
our
dear
grasmere
making
a
little
round
lake
of
own
with
never
a
house
never
a
green
field
but
the
copses
and
the
bare
hills
enclosing
it
and
the
river
flowing
out
of
it
above
rose
the
coniston
fells
in
their
own
shape
and
colour
not
man
hills
but
all
for
themselves
the
sky
and
the
clouds
and
a
few
wild
creatures
went
to
search
for
something
new
we
saw
him
climbing
up
towards
a
rock
he
called
us
and
we
found
him
in
a
bower
the
sweetest
that
was
ever
seen
the
rock
on
one
side
is
very
high
and
all
covered
with
ivy
which
hung
loosely
about
and
bore
bunches
of
brown
berries
on
the
other
side
it
was
higher
than
my
head
we
looked
down
on
the
ambleside
vale
that
seemed
to
wind
away
from
us
the
village
lying
under
the
hill
the
island
was
reflected
beautifully
about
this
bower
there
is
ivy
holly
hawthorn
grasses
and
flowers
and
a
carpet
of
moss
above
at
the
top
of
the
rock
there
is
another
spot
it
is

that
grew
there
and
just
looked
out
on
the
road
from
its
own
sheltered
bower
the
clouds
moved
as
william
observed
in
one
regular
body
like
a
multitude
in
motion
a
sky
all
clouds
over
not
one
cloud
on
our
return
it
broke
a

out

at
the

he
came
home
and
said
his
loins

that
when
i
was
a
child
i
would
not
have
pulled
a
strawberry
blossom
i
left
him
and
wrote
out
manciple
at
dinner
time
he
came
in
with
the

but
it
was
not
quite
finished
and
it
kept
him
long
off
his
dinner
it
is
now
done
he
is
working
at
he
promised
me
he
would
get
his
tea
and
do
no
more
but
i
have
got
mine
an
hour
and
a
quarter
and
he
has
scarcely
begun
his
we
have
let
the
bright
sun
go
down
without
walking
now
a
heavy
shower
comes
on
and
i
guess
we
shall
not
walk
at
all
i

lines
to
coleridge
then
we
walked
backwards
and
forwards
between
our
house
and
olliff
we
called
upon
hutchinson
and
bell
addison
william
left
me
sitting
on

stone
when

corrected
the
chaucers
but
i
could
not

after
i
had
written
down
which
william
finished
this
morning
luff
called
he
was
very
lame
limped
into
the
kitchen
he
came
on
a
little
pony
we
then
went
to
grove
sate
a
while
at
first
afterwards
william
lay
and
i
lay
in
the
trench
under
the
fence
he
with
his
eyes
shut
and
listening
to
the
waterfalls
and
the
birds
there
was
no
one
waterfall
above
another
it
was
a
sound
of
waters
in
the
air
the
voice
of
the
air
william
heard
me
breathing
and
rustling
now
and
then
but
we
both
lay
still
and
unseen
by
one
another
he
thought
that
it
would
be
so
sweet
thus
to
lie
in
the
grave
to
hear
the
peaceful
sounds
of
the
earth
and
just
to
know
that
our
dear
friends
were
near
the
lake
was
still
there
was
a
boat
out
silver
how
reflected
with
delicate
purple
and
yellowish
hues
as
i
have
seen
spar
lambs
on
the
island
and
running
races
together
by
the
in
the
round
field
near
us
the
copses
greenish
hawthorns
green
cottages
smoking
as
i
lay
down
on
the
grass
i
observed
the
glittering
silver
line
on
the
ridge
of
the
backs
of
the
sheep
owing
to
their
situation
respecting
the
sun
which
made
them
look
beautiful
but
with
something
of
strangeness
like
animals
of
another
kind
as
if
belonging
to
a
more
splendid
world
i
got
mullins
and
pansies
april
we
came
into
the
orchard
directly
after
breakfast
and
sate
there
the
lake
was
calm
the
day
cloudy
two
fishermen
by
the
lake
side
william
began
to
write
the
poem
of
walked
backwards
and
forwards
with
william
he
repeated
his
poem
to
me
then
he
got
to
work
again
and
would
not
give
over
he
had
not
finished
his
dinner
till
after
dinner
we
took
up
the
fur
gown
into
the
hollins
above
we
found
a
sweet
seat
and
thither
we
will
often
go
we
spread
the
gown
put
on
each
a
cloak
and
there
we
lay
william
fell
asleep
he
had
a
bad
headache
owing
to
his
having
been
disturbed
the
night
before
with
reading
letter
i
did
not
sleep
but
lay
with
eyes
looking
at
the
prospect
as
on
a
vision
almost
i
was
so
resigned
to
it
loughrigg
fell
was
the
most
distant
hill
then
came
the
lake
slipping
in
between
the
copses
above
the
copse
the
round
swelling
field
nearer
to
me
a
wild
intermixture
of
rocks
trees
and
patches
of
grassy
ground
when
we
turned
the
corner
of
our
little
shelter
we
saw
the
church
and
the
whole
vale
it
is
a
blessed
place
the
birds
were
about
us
on
all
sides
skobbies
robins
and
crows
now
and
then
flew
over
our
heads
as
we
were
warned
by
the
sound
of
the
beating
of
the
air
above
we
stayed
till
the
light
of
day
was
going
and
the
little
birds
had
begun
to
settle
their
singing
but
there
was
a
thrush
not
far
off
that
seemed
to
sing
louder
and
clearer
than
the
thrushes
had
sung
when
it
was
quite
day
we
came
in
at
got
tea
wrote
to
coleridge
and
i
wrote
to
clarkson
part
of

that

curiously
used
in
the
lake

a
woman
there
once
told
me
that
ruskin
was
very
much
resigned
to
his
own
ed
may
rose
not
till
a
heavenly
morning
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
we
went
into
the
garden
and
sowed
the
scarlet
beans
about
the
house
it
was
a
clear
sky
i
sowed
the
flowers
william
helped
me
we
then
went
and
sate
in
the
orchard
till
dinner
time
it
was
very
hot
william
wrote
we
planned
a
shed
for
the
sun
was
too
much
for
us
after
dinner
we
went
again
to
our
old
in
the
hollins
under
the
rock
we
first
lay
under
the
holly
where
we
saw
nothing
but
the
holly
tree
and
a
budding
elm
tree
mossed
with
the
sky
above
our
heads
but
that
holly
tree
had
a
beauty
about
it
more
than
its
own
knowing
as
we
did
when
we
arose
when
the
sun
had
got
low
enough
we
went
to
the
rock
shade
oh
the
overwhelming
beauty
of
the
vale
below
greener
than
green
two
ravens
flew
high
high
in
the
sky
and
the
sun
shone
upon
their
bellies
and
their
wings
long
after
there
was
none
of
his
light
to
be
seen
but
a
little
space
on
the
top
of
loughrigg
fell
heard
the
cuckoo
this
first
of
may
we
went
down
to
tea
at
and
returned
after
tea
the
landscape
was
fading
sheep
and
lambs
quiet
among
the
rocks
we
walked
towards
king
and
backwards
and
forwards
the
sky
was
perfectly
cloudless
it
is
often
so
three
solitary
stars

william
went
to
bed
nervous
and
jaded
in
the
extreme
he
rose
refreshed
i
wrote
out
leech
for
him
which
he
had
begun
the
night
before
and
of
which
he
wrote
several
stanzas
in
bed
this
morning
they
started
to
walk
to
wytheburn
it
was
very
hot
we
rested
several
times
by
the
way
read
and
repeated
leech
we
saw
coleridge
on
the
wytheburn
side
of
the
water
he
crossed
the
beck
to
us
simpson
was
fishing
there
william
and
i
ate
luncheon
and
then
went
on
towards
the
waterfall
it
is
a
glorious
wild
solitude
under
that
lofty
purple
crag
it
stood
upright
by
itself
its
own
self
and
its
shadow
below
one
mass
all
else
was
sunshine
we
went
on
further
a
bird
at
the
top
of
the
crag
was
flying
round
and
round
and
looked
in
thinness
and
transparency
shape
and
motion
like
a
moth
we
climbed
the
hill
but
looked
in
vain
for
a
shade
except
at
the
foot
of
the
great
waterfall
we
came
down
and
rested
upon
a
rock
rising
out
of
the
bed
of
the
river
there
we
lay
ate
our
dinner
and
stayed
there
till
about
four
or
later
william
and
coleridge
repeated
and
read
verses
i
drank
a
little
brandy
and
water
and
was
in
heaven
the
stag
horn
is
very
beautiful
and
fresh
springing
upon
the
fells
mountain
ashes
green
we
drank
tea
at
a
farm
house
we
parted
from
coleridge
at
sara
crag
after
having
looked
for
the
letters
which
carved
in
the
morning
i
missed
them
all
william
deepened
the
x
with
we
sate
afterwards
on
the
wall
seeing
the
sun
go
down
and
the
reflections
in
the
still
water
looked
well
and
parted
from
us
cheerfully
hopping
upon
the
side
stones
on
the
raise
we
met
a
woman
with
two
little
girls
one
in
her
arms
the
other
about
four
years
old
walking
by
her
side
a
pretty
little
thing
but
young
as
she
was
she
walked
carefully
with
them
alas
too
young
for
such
cares
and
such
travels
the
mother
when
we
accosted
her
told
us
how
her
husband
had
left
her
and
gone
off
with
another
woman
and
how
she
them
then
her
fury
kindled
and
her
eyes
rolled
about
she
changed
again
to
tears
she
was
a
cockermouth
woman
thirty
years
of
age
a
child
at
cockermouth
when
i
was
i
was
moved
and
gave
her
a
shilling

the
auld

arms

rested
often

upon
the
bridges

about
ten
we
went
soon
to
bed
i
repeated
verses
to
william
while
he
was
in

was
soothed
and

left
him

spot
over
and

twilight
and
walked
till

the
old
moon
in
her
arms

not
so
plain
to
be

well
so
feeling
himself
strong

little
birds

more
than

busy
with
their
voices

at
heart

side
william
pulled
ivy
with
beautiful
berries
i
put
it
over
the
sate
in
the
orchard
the
hour
before
dinner
coldish
in
the
evening
we
were
sitting
at
the
table
writing
when
we
were
roused
by
coleridge
voice
below
he
had
walked
looked
palish
but
was
not
much
tired
we
sate
up
till
one
all
together
then
william
went
to
bed
and
i
sate
with
in
the
where
he
slept
till
a
quarter
past
two
wrote
to
the
day
was
very
cold
with
snow
showers
coleridge
had
intended
going
in
the
morning
to
keswick
but
the
cold
and
showers
hindered
him
we
went
with
him
after
tea
as
far
as
the
plantations
by
the
roadside
descending
to
wytheburn
he
did
not
look
well
when
we
parted
from
him
a
very
cold
morning
hail
and
snow
showers
all
day
we
went
to
brothers
wood
intending
to
get
plants
and
to
go
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
to
the
foot
we
did
go
a
part
of
the
way
but
there
was
no
pleasure
in
stepping
along
that
difficult
sauntering
road
in
this
ungenial
weather
we
turned
again
and
walked
backwards
and
forwards
in
brothers
wood
william
tired
himself
with
seeking
an
epithet
for
the
cuckoo
i
sate
a
while
upon
my
last
summer
seat
the
mossy
stone
william
unoccupied
beside
me
and
the
space
between
where
coleridge
has
so
often
lain
the
oak
trees
are
just
putting
forth
yellow
knots
of
leaves
the
ashes
with
their
flowers
passing
away
and
leaves
coming
out
the
blue
hyacinth
is
not
quite
full
blown
gowans
are
coming
out
marsh
marigolds
in
full
glory
the
little
star
plant
a
star
without
a
flower
we
took
home
a
great
load
of
gowans
and
planted
them
about
the
orchard
after
dinner
i
worked
bread
then
came
and
mended
stockings
beside
william
he
fell
asleep
after
tea
i
walked
to
rydale
for
letters
it
was
a
strange
night
the
hills
were
covered
over
with
a
slight
covering
of
hail
or
snow
just
so
as
to
give
them
a
hoary
winter
look
with
the
black
rocks
the
woods
looked
miserable
the
coppices
green
as
grass
which
looked
quite
unnatural
and
they
seemed
half
shrivelled
up
as
if
they
shrank
from
the
air
o
thought
i
what
a
beautiful
thing
god
has
made
winter
to
be
by
stripping
the
trees
and
letting
us
see
their
shapes
and
forms
what
a
freedom
does
it
seem
to
give
to
the
storms
there
were
several
new
flowers
out
but
i
had
no
pleasure
in
looking
at
them
i
walked
as
fast
as
i
could
back
again
with
my
letter
from
h
met
william
at
the
top
of
white
moss
near
ten
when
we
came
in

nervous
after

very
cold

cheerless
morning

the

a

want

we
went
into
the
orchard
after
i
had
written
to
then
on
to
olliff
intake
the
columbine
was
growing
upon
the
rocks
here
and
there
a
solitary
plant
sheltered
and
shaded
by
the
tufts
and
bowers
of
trees
it
is
a
graceful
slender
creature
a
female
seeking
retirement
and
growing
freest
and
most
graceful
where
it
is
most
alone
i
observed
that
the
more
shaded
plants
were
always
the
tallest
a
short
note
and
gooseberries
from
coleridge
we
walked
upon
the
turf
near
john
grove
it
was
a
lovely
night
the
clouds
of
the
western
sky
reflected
a
saffron
light
upon
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
all
was
still
we
went
to
look
at
rydale
there
was
an
alpine
red
upon
the
tops
of
the
mountains
this
was
gone
when
we
came
in
view
of
the
lake
but
we
saw
the
lake
from
a
new
and
most
beautiful
point
of
view
between
two
little
rocks
and
behind
a
small
ridge
that
had
concealed
it
from
us
this
white
moss
a
place
made
for
all
kinds
of
beautiful
works

and
nature

above

in
the
morning
we
observed
that
the
scarlet
beans
were
drooping
in
the
leaves
in
great
numbers
owing
we
guess
to
an
insect
yesterday
an
old
man
called
a
man
above
seventy
years
of
age
he
said
he
had
been
a
soldier
that
his
wife
and
children
had
died
in
jamaica
he
had
a
beggar
wallet
over
his
shoulders
a
coat
of
shreds
and
patches
altogether
of
a
drab
colour
he
was
tall
and
though
his
body
was
bent
he
had
the
look
of
one
used
to
have
been
upright
i
talked
a
while
and
then
gave
him
a
piece
of
cold
bacon
and
some
money
said
he
you
a
fine
woman
i
could
not
help
smiling
i
suppose
he
meant
you
a
kind
woman
afterwards
a
woman
called
travelling
to
glasgow
after
dinner
we
went
into
frank
field
crawled
up
the
little
glen
and
planned
a
seat
found
a
beautiful
purple
fungus
in

after

and
we
watched
the
little
birds
as
we
sate
at
the
door
of
the
the
oak
copses
are
brown
as
in
autumn
with
the
late
frosts
we
have
been
reading
the

and
some
of
the
writings
of

is
now
sleeping
with
the
window
open
lying
on
the

the
thrush
is
singing
there
are
i
do
believe
a
thousand
buds
on
the
honeysuckle
tree
all
small
and
far
from
blowing
save
one
that
is
retired
behind
the
twigs
close
to
the
wall
and
as
snug
as

john

is
very
beautiful
blended
with

yesterday
morning
william
walked
as
far
as
the
swan
with
aggy
fisher
who
was
going
to
attend
upon
goan
dying
infant
she
said
there
are
many
heavier
crosses
than
the
death
of
an
infant
and
went
on
there
was
a
woman
in
this
vale
who
buried
four
children
in
one
year
and
i
have
heard
her
say
when
many
years
were
gone
by
that
she
had
more
pleasure
in
thinking
of
those
four
than
of
her
living
children
for
as
children
get
up
and
have
families
of
their
own
their
duty
to
their
parents
out
and
she
could
trip
lightly
by
the
graves
of
those
who
died
when
they
were
young
as
she
went
to
church
on
a
sunday
a
very
affecting
letter
came
from
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
window
reading
milton
to
william
i
answered
this
letter
before
i
went
to
bed
a
fine
showery
morning
i
made
both
pies
and
bread
but
we
first
walked
into
easedale
and
sate
under
the
oak
trees
upon
the
mossy
stones
there
were
one
or
two
slight
showers
the
gowans
were
flourishing
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
the
strawberry
flower
hanging
over
the
brook
all
things
soft
and
green
in
the
afternoon
william
sate
in
the
orchard
i
went
there
was
tired
and
fell
asleep
william
began
a
letter
to
john
wilson
a
showery
morning
we
were
writing
the
letter
to
john
wilson
when
ellen
came
after
dinner
i
walked
into
john
intake
with
ellen
he
brought
us
letters
from
coleridge
clarkson
and
sara
hutchinson
i
wrote
to
mary
this
morning
sent
the
indolence
poem
copied
the
letter
to
john
wilson
and
wrote
to
my
brother
richard
and
coleridge
in
the
evening
i
walked
with
ellen
to
butterlip
how
it
was
a
very
sweet
evening
there
was
the
cuckoo
and
the
little
birds
the
copses
still
injured
but
the
trees
in
general
looked
most
soft
and
beautiful
in
tufts
i
went
with
ellen
in
the
morning
to
rydale
falls
ellen
and
i
rode
to
windermere
we
had
a
fine
sunny
day
neither
hot
nor
cold
i
mounted
the
horse
at
the
quarry
we
had
no
difficulties
or
delays
but
at
the
gates
i
was
enchanted
with
some
of
the
views
from
the
high
ray
the
view
is
very
delightful
rich
and
festive
water
and
wood
houses
groves
hedgerows
green
fields
and
mountains
white
houses
large
and
small
we
passed
two
or
three
statesmen
houses
the
curwens
shrubberies
looked
pitiful
enough
under
the
native
trees
we
put
up
our
horses
ate
our
dinner
by
the
and
walked
up
to
the
station
we
went
to
the
island
walked
round
it
and
crossed
the
lake
with
our
horse
in
the
ferry
the
shrubs
have
been
cut
away
in
some
parts
of
the
island
i
observed
to
the
boatman
that
i
did
not
think
it
improved
he
replied
we
think
it
is
for
one
could
hardly
see
the
house
before
it
seems
to
me
to
be
however
no
better
than
it
was
they
have
made
no
natural
glades
it
is
merely
a
lawn
with
a
few
miserable
young
trees
standing
as
if
they
were
there
are
no
sheep
no
cattle
upon
these
lawns
it
is
neither
one
thing
nor
another
neither
natural
nor
wholly
cultivated
and
artificial
which
it
was
before
and
that
great
house
mercy
upon
us
if
it
be
concealed
it
would
be
well
for
all
who
are
not
pained
to
see
the
pleasantest
of
earthly
spots
deformed
by
man
but
it
be
covered
even
the
tallest
of
our
old
oak
trees
would
not
reach
to
the
top
of
it
when
we
went
into
the
boat
there
were
two
men
standing
at
the
one
seemed
to
be
about
sixty
a
man
with
a
jolly
red
face
he
looked
as
if
he
might
have
lived
many
years
in
curwen
house
he
wore
a
blue
jacket
and
trousers
as
the
people
who
live
close
by
windermere
particularly
at
the
places
of
chief
resort
he
looked
significantly
at
our
boatman
just
as
we
were
rowing
off
and
said
thomas
mind
you
take
the
directions
off
that
cask
you
know
what
i
mean
it
will
serve
as
a
blind
for
them
know
it
was
a
blind
business
both
for
you
and
the
coachman
and
all
of
us
mind
you
take
off
the
directions
wink
as
good
as
a
nod
with
some
folks
and
then
he
turned
round
looking
at
his
companion
with
an
air
of
and
deep
insight
into
unknown
things
i
could
hardly
help
laughing
outright
at
him
the
laburnums
blossom
freely
at
the
island
and
in
the
shrubberies
on
the
shore
they
are
blighted
everywhere
else
roses
of
various
sorts
now
out
the
brooms
were
in
full
glory
everywhere
veins
of
gold
among
the
copses
the
hawthorns
in
the
valley
fading
away
beautiful
upon
the
hills
we
reached
home
at
three
after
tea
william
went
out
and
walked
and
wrote
that
poem
the
sun
has
long
been
set
etc
he
walked
on
our
own
path
and
wrote
the
lines
he
called
me
into
the
orchard
and
there
repeated
them
to
me
the
hawthorns
on
the
mountain
sides
like
orchards
in
blossom
coleridge
came
in
with
a
sack
full
of
books
and
a
branch
of
mountain
ash
he
had
been
attacked
by
a
cow
he
came
over
by
grisdale
a
furious
wind
a
rainy
morning
coleridge
set
off
before
dinner
we
went
with
him
to
the
raise
but
it
rained
so
we
went
no
further
sheltered
under
a
wall
he
would
be
sadly
wet
for
a
furious
shower
came
on
just
when
we
parted
a
fine
morning
sunshiny
and
bright
but
with
rainy
clouds
william
has
been
altering
the
poem
to
mary
this
morning
i
wrote
out
poems
for
our
journey
simpson
came
when
we
were
in
the
orchard
in
the
morning
and
brought
us
a
beautiful
drawing
which
he
had
done
in
the
evening
we
walked
first
on
our
own
path
it
was
a
silent
night
the
stars
were
out
by
ones
and
twos
but
no
cuckoo
no
little
birds
the
air
was
not
warm
and
we
have
observed
that
since
tuesday
when
william
wrote
the
sun
has
long
been
set
that
we
have
had
no
birds
singing
after
the
evening
is
fairly
set
in
we
walked
to
our
new
view
of
rydale
but
it
put
on
a
sullen
face
there
was
an
owl
hooting
in
bainrigg
its
first
halloo
was
so
like
a
human
shout
that
i
was
surprised
when
it
gave
its
second
call
tremulous
and
lengthened
out
to
find
that
the
shout
had
come
from
an
owl
the
full
moon
not
quite
full
was
among
a
company
of
shady
island
clouds
and
the
sky
bluer
about
it
than
the
natural
sky
blue
william
observed
that
the
full
moon
above
a
dark
fir
grove
is
a
fine
image
of
the
descent
of
a
superior
being
there
was
a
shower
which
drove
us
into
john
grove
before
we
had
quitted
our
favourite
path
we
walked
upon
john
path
before
we
went
to
view
rydale
william
wrote
to
mary
and
sara
about
leech
and
wrote
to
both
of
them
in
one
and
to
coleridge
also
i
walked
with
william
on
our
own
path
we
were
driven
away
by
the
horses
that
go
on
the
commons
then
we
went
to
look
at
rydale
walked
a
little
in
the
fir
grove
went
again
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
came
home
a
mild
and
sweet
night
william
stayed
behind
me
i
threw
him
the
cloak
out
of
the
window
the
moon
overcast
he
sate
a
few
minutes
in
the
orchard
came
in
sleepy
and
hurried
to
bed
i
carried
him
his
bread
and
butter
a
sweet
grey
mild
morning
the
birds
sing
soft
and
low
william
has
not
slept
all
night
it
wants
only
ten
minutes
of
ten
and
he
is
in
bed
yet
after
william
rose
we
went
and
sate
in
the
orchard
till
dinner
time
we
walked
a
long
time
in
the
evening
upon
our
favourite
path
the
owls
hooted
the
night
hawk
sang
to
itself
incessantly
but
there
were
no
little
birds
no
thrushes
i
left
william
writing
a
few
lines
about
the
night
hawk
and
other
images
of
the
evening
and
went
to
seek
for
letters
we
walked
towards
rydale
for
letters
one
from
mary
we
went
up
into
rydale
woods
and
read
it
there
we
sate
near
the
old
wall
which
fenced
a
hazel
grove
which
william
said
was
exactly
like
the
filbert
grove
at
middleham
it
is
a
beautiful
spot
a
sloping
or
rather
steep
piece
of
ground
with
hazels
growing
tall
and
erect
in
clumps
at
distances
almost
seeming
regular
as
if
they
had
been
planted
i
wrote
to
mary
after
dinner
while
william
sate
in
the
orchard
i
spoke
of
the
little
birds
keeping
us
company
and
william
told
me
that
that
very
morning
a
bird
had
perched
upon
his
leg
he
had
been
lying
very
still
and
had
watched
this
little
creature
it
had
come
under
the
bench
where
he
was
sitting
he
thoughtlessly
stirred
himself
to
look
further
at
it
and
it
flew
on
to
the
apple
tree
above
him
it
was
a
little
young
creature
that
had
just
left
its
nest
equally
unacquainted
with
man
and
unaccustomed
to
struggle
against
the
storms
and
winds
while
it
was
upon
the
apple
tree
the
wind
blew
about
the
stiff
boughs
and
the
bird
seemed
bemazed
and
not
strong
enough
to
strive
with
it
the
swallows
come
to
the
window
as
if
wishing
to
build
but
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
have
courage
for
it
but
i
believe
they
will
build
in
my
room
window
they
twitter
and
make
a
bustle
and
a
little
cheerful
song
hanging
against
the
panes
of
glass
with
their
soft
white
bellies
close
to
the
glass
and
their
forked
tails
they
swim
round
and
round
and
again
they
come
i
do
not
now
see
the
brownness
that
was
in
the
coppices
the
bower
hawthorn
blossoms
passed
away
those
on
the
hills
are
a
faint
white
the
wild
is
coming
out
and
the
wild
roses
i
have
seen
no
yet
foxgloves
are
now
frequent
when
i
came
home
i
found
william
at
work
attempting
to
alter
a
stanza
in
the
poem
on
our
going
for
mary
which
i
convinced
him
did
not
need
altering
we
sate
in
the
house
after
dinner
in
the
evening
walked
on
our
favourite
path
a
short
letter
from
coleridge
william
added
a
little
to
the
ode
he
is
writing
footnote
doubtless
the
intimations
of
ed
when
we
were
sitting
after
breakfast
luff
came
in
he
had
rode
over
the
fells
he
brought
news
about
lord
intention
to
pay
all
debts
and
a
letter
from
clarkson
he
saw
our
garden
was
astonished
at
the
scarlet
beans
etc
etc
etc
when
he
was
gone
we
wrote
to
coleridge
and
my
brother
richard
about
the
affair
william
determined
to
go
to
eusemere
on
monday
the
swallows
were
very
busy
under
my
window
this
morning
coleridge
when
he
was
last
here
told
us
that
for
many
years
there
being
no
quaker
meeting
at
keswick
a
single
old
quaker
woman
used
to
go
regularly
alone
every
sunday
to
attend
the
and
there
used
to
sit
and
perform
her
worship
alone
in
that
beautiful
place
among
those
fir
trees
in
that
spacious
vale
under
the
great
mountain
skiddaw
on
thursday
morning
miss
hudson
of
workington
called
she
said
i
sow
flowers
in
the
parks
several
miles
from
home
and
my
mother
and
i
visit
them
and
watch
them
how
they
grow
this
may
show
that
botanists
may
be
often
deceived
when
they
find
rare
flowers
growing
far
from
houses
this
was
a
very
ordinary
young
woman
such
as
in
any
town
in
the
north
of
england
one
may
find
a
score
i
sate
up
a
while
after
william
he
then
called
me
down
to
him
i
was
writing
to
mary
i
read
churchill
returned
again
to
my
writing
and
did
not
go
to
bed
till
he
called
to
me
the
shutters
were
closed
but
i
heard
the
birds
singing
there
was
our
own
thrush
shouting
with
an
impatient
shout
so
it
sounded
to
me
the
morning
was
still
the
twittering
of
the
little
birds
was
very
gloomy
the
owls
had
hooted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
now
the
cocks
were
crowing
it
was
near
daylight
i
put
out
my
candle
and
went
to
bed
we
were
in
the
orchard
a
great
part
of
the
morning
after
tea
we
walked
upon
our
own
path
for
a
long
time
we
talked
sweetly
together
about
the
disposal
of
our
riches
we
lay
upon
the
sloping
turf
earth
and
sky
were
so
lovely
that
they
melted
our
very
hearts
the
sky
to
the
north
was
of
a
chastened
yet
rich
yellow
fading
into
pale
blue
and
streaked
and
scattered
over
with
steady
islands
of
purple
melting
away
into
shades
of
pink
it
was
like
a
vision
to
me
i
walked
to
rydale
i
waited
long
for
the
post
lying
in
the
field
and
looking
at
the
distant
mountains
looking
and
listening
to
the
river
i
met
the
post
letters
from
montagu
and
richard
i
hurried
back
forwarded
these
to
william
and
wrote
to
montagu
when
i
came
home
i
wrote
to
my
brother
christopher
i
could
settle
to
nothing
i
read
the
night
and
began
you
like
a
sunshiny
morning
i
walked
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
sate
under
a
wall
near
john
grove
facing
the
sun
i
read
a
scene
or
two
in
you
like
coleridge
and
leslie
came
just
as
i
had
lain
down
after
dinner
brought
me
william
letter
he
had
got
well
to
eusemere
coleridge
and
i
accompanied
leslie
to
the
it
was
a
sullen
coldish
evening
no
sunshine
but
after
we
had
parted
from
leslie
a
light
came
out
suddenly
that
repaid
us
for
all
it
fell
only
upon
one
hill
and
the
island
but
it
arrayed
the
grass
and
trees
in
brightness
i
cooked
coleridge
supper
we
sate
up
till
one
i
went
with
half
way
up
the
raise
it
was
a
cool
morning
william
came
in
just
when
had
left
me
it
was
a
mild
rainy
evening
we
sate
together
talking
till
the
first
dawning
of
day
a
happy
time
i
went
just
before
tea
into
the
garden
i
looked
up
at
my
swallow
nest
and
it
was
gone
it
had
fallen
down
poor
little
creatures
they
could
not
themselves
be
more
distressed
than
i
was
i
went
upstairs
to
look
at
the
ruins
they
lay
in
a
large
heap
upon
the
window
ledge
these
swallows
had
been
ten
days
employed
in
building
this
nest
and
it
seemed
to
be
almost
finished
i
had
watched
them
early
in
the
morning
in
the
day
many
and
many
a
time
and
in
the
evenings
when
it
was
almost
dark
i
had
seen
them
sitting
together
side
by
side
in
their
unfinished
nest
both
morning
and
night
when
they
first
came
about
the
window
they
used
to
hang
against
the
panes
with
their
white
bellies
and
their
forked
tails
looking
like
fish
but
then
they
fluttered
and
sang
their
own
little
twittering
song
as
soon
as
the
nest
was
broad
enough
a
sort
of
ledge
for
them
they
sate
both
mornings
and
evenings
but
they
did
not
pass
the
night
there
i
watched
them
one
morning
when
william
was
at
eusemere
for
more
than
an
hour
every
now
and
then
there
was
a
motion
in
their
wings
a
sort
of
tremulousness
and
they
sang
a
low
song
to
one
another
it
is
now
eight
i
will
go
and
see
if
my
swallows
are
on
their
nest
yes
there
they
are
side
by
side
both
looking
down
into
the
garden
i
have
been
out
on
purpose
to
see
their
faces
i
knew
by
looking
at
the
window
that
they
were
there
coleridge
and
william
came
in
at
about
eleven
they
talked
till
after
twelve
we
met
an
old
man
between
the
raise
and
lewthwaites
he
wore
a
rusty
but
untorn
hat
an
excellent
blue
coat
waistcoat
and
breeches
and
good
mottled
worsted
stockings
his
beard
was
very
thick
and
grey
of
a
fortnight
growth
we
guessed
it
was
a
regular
beard
like
grey
his
bundle
contained
sheffield
ware
william
said
to
him
after
we
had
asked
him
what
his
business
was

are
a
very
old
man
aye
i
am
i
joined
in
have
you
any
children
children
yes

i
have
children
and
and
great
i
have
a
great
a
fine
lass
thirteen
years
old
i
then
said
wo
they
take
care
of
you
he
replied
much
offended
thank
god
i
can
take
care
of
myself
he
said
he
had
been
a
servant
of
the
marquis
of
granby
o
he
was
a
good
man
he
in
heaven
i
hope
he
is
he
then
told
us
how
he
shot
himself
at
bath
that
he
was
with
him
in
germany
and
travelled
with
him
everywhere
he
was
a
famous
boxer
sir
and
then
he
told
us
a
story
of
his
fighting
with
his
farmer
he
used
always
to
call
me
bland
and
sharp
then
every
now
and
then
he
broke
out
he
was
a
good
man
when
we
were
travelling
he
never
asked
at
the
as
it
might
be
there
pointing
to
the
swan
what
we
were
to
pay
but
he
would
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
give
them
what
he
liked
and
when
he
came
out
of
the
house
he
would
say
now
they
would
have
charged
me
a
shilling
or
tenpence
god
help
them
poor
creatures
i
asked
him
again
about
his
children
how
many
he
had
says
he
i
can
not
tell
you
i
suppose
he
confounded
children
and
together
i
have
one
daughter
that
keeps
a
at
skipton
in
craven
she
teaches
flowering
and
marking
and
another
that

a
at
ingleton
i
brought
up
my
family
under
the
marquis
he
was
familiar
with
all
parts
of
yorkshire
he
asked
us
where
we
lived
at
grasmere
the
bonniest
dale
in
all
england
says
the
old
man
i
bought
a
pair
of
slippers
from
him
and
we
sate
together
by
the
when
we
parted
i
tried
to
lift
his
bundle
and
it
was
almost
more
than
i
could
do
after
tea
i
wrote
to
coleridge
and
closed
up
my
letter
to
we
went
soon
to
bed
a
weight
of
children
a
poor
man
blessing
a
very
rainy
morning
i
left
william
and
wrote
a
short
letter
to
and
to
coleridge
and
transcribed
the
alterations
in
leech
william
finished
leech
a
very
sweet
morning
william
stayed
some
time
in
the
orchard
i
copied
out
leech
for
coleridge
and
for
us
wrote
to
clarkson
and
coleridge
we
set
off
towards
rydale
for
letters
the
rain
met
us
at
the
top
of
the
white
moss
and
it
came
on
very
heavily
afterwards
it
drove
past
nab
scar
in
a
substantial
shape
as
if
going
to
grasmere
was
as
far
as
it
could
go
the
swallows
have
completed
their
beautiful
nest
walked
on
the
white
moss
well
for
them
children
are
in
bed
when
they
shine
when
i
was
coming
home
a
passed
with
a
little
girl
behind
in
a
patched
ragged
cloak
in
the
afternoon
after
we
had
talked
a
little
william
fell
asleep
i
read
the
then
i
went
to
bed
but
did
not
sleep
the
swallows
stole
in
and
out
of
their
nest
and
sate
there
quite
still
they
sung
low
for
two
minutes
or
more
at
a
time
just
like
a
muffled
robin
william
was
looking
at
when
i
got
up
he
arranged
it
and
after
tea
i
wrote
it
out
lines
the
moon
was
behind
william
hurried
me
out
in
hopes
that
i
should
see
her
we
walked
first
to
the
top
of
the
hill
to
see
rydale
it
was
dark
and
dull
but
our
own
vale
was
very
solemn
the
shape
of
helm
crag
was
quite
distinct
though
black
we
walked
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
white
moss
path
there
was
a
white
brightness
on
the
lake
the
wyke
cottage
right
at
the
foot
of
silver
how
out
but
not
so
numerous
as
last
night
o
beautiful
place
dear
mary
william
the
hour
is
come
i
must
prepare
to
go
the
swallows
i
must
leave
them
the
wall
the
garden
the
roses
all
dear
creatures
they
sang

william
and
i
set
forward
to
keswick
on
our
road
to
gallow
hill
we
had
a
pleasant
ride
though
the
day
was
showery
coleridge
met
us
at
sara
rock
we
had
been
told
by
a
handsome
man
an
inhabitant
of
wytheburn
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
and
who
seemed
by
the
bye
much
pleased
with
his
companion
that
was
waiting
for
us
we
reached
keswick
against
we
called
at
calvert
on
the
saturday
evening
on
monday
july
we
went
to
eusemere
coleridge
walked
with
us
six
or
seven
miles
he
was
not
well
and
we
had
a
melancholy
parting
after
having
sate
together
in
silence
by
the
we
turned
aside
to
explore
the
country
near
and
had
a
new
and
delightful
walk
the
valley
which
is
subject
to
the
decaying
mansion
that
stands
at
its
head
seems
to
join
its
testimony
to
that
of
the
house
to
the
falling
away
of
the
family
greatness
and
the
hedges
are
in
bad
condition
the
land
wants
draining
and
is
overrun
with
brackens
yet
there
is
a
something
everywhere
that
tells
of
its
former
possessors
the
trees
are
left
scattered
about
as
if
intended
to
be
like
a
park
and
these
are
very
interesting
standing
as
they
do
upon
the
sides
of
the
steep
hills
that
slope
down
to
the
bed
of
the
river
a
little
stream
that
spreads
out
to
a
considerable
breadth
at
the
village
of
dacre
a
little
above
dacre
we
came
into
the
right
road
to
clarkson
after
having
walked
through
woods
and
fields
never
exactly
knowing
whether
we
were
right
or
wrong
we
learnt
however
that
we
had
saved
we
sate
down
by
the
to
rest
and
saw
some
swallows
flying
about
and
under
the
bridge
and
two
little
schoolboys
were
loitering
among
the
scars
seeking
after
their
nests
we
reached
clarkson
at
about
eight
after
a
sauntering
walk
having
lingered
and
loitered
and
sate
down
together
that
we
might
be
alone
and
were
just
come
from
luff
we
spent
tuesday
the
of
july
at
eusemere
and
on
wednesday
morning
the
we
walked
to
emont
bridge
and
mounted
the
coach
between
bird
nest
and
hartshorn
tree
at
greta
bridge
the
sun
shone
cheerfully
and
a
glorious
ride
we
had
over
gaterly
moor
every
building
was
bathed
in
golden
light
the
trees
were
more
bright
than
earthly
trees
and
we
saw
round
us
miles
beyond
miles
darlington
spire
etc
etc
we
reached
leeming
lane
at
about
nine
supped
comfortably
and
enjoyed
our
fire
on
thursday
morning
at
a
little
before
seven
being
the
july
we
got
into
a
and
went
to
thirsk
to
breakfast
we
were
well
treated
but
when
the
landlady
understood
that
we
were
going
to
off
and
leave
our
luggage
behind
she
threw
out
some
saucy
words
in
our
hearing
the
day
was
very
hot
and
we
rested
often
and
long
before
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
hambledon
hills
and
while
we
were
climbing
them
still
oftener
we
were
almost
overpowered
with
thirst
when
i
heard
the
trickling
of
a
little
stream
of
water
i
was
before
william
and
i
stopped
till
he
came
up
to
me
we
sate
a
long
time
by
this
water
and
climbed
the
hill
slowly
i
was
footsore
the
sun
shone
hot
the
little
scotch
cattle
panted
and
tossed
fretfully
about
the
view
was
hazy
and
we
could
see
nothing
from
the
top
of
the
hill
but
an
undistinct
country
full
of
trees
but
the
buildings
towns
and
houses
were
lost
we
stopped
to
examine
that
curious
stone
then
walked
along
the
flat
common
arrived
very
hungry
at
rivaux
nothing
to
eat
at
the
millers
as
we
expected
but
at
an
exquisitely
neat
we
got
some
boiled
milk
and
bread
this
strengthened
us
and
i
went
down
to
look
at
the
ruins
thrushes
were
singing
cattle
feeding
among
hillocks
about
the
ruins
the
hillocks
were
scattered
over
with
of
wild
roses
and
other
shrubs
and
covered
with
wild
flowers
i
could
have
stayed
in
this
solemn
quiet
spot
till
evening
without
a
thought
of
moving
but
william
was
waiting
for
me
so
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
went
away
we
walked
upon
duncombe
terrace
and
looked
down
upon
the
abbey
it
stands
in
a
larger
valley
among
a
brotherhood
of
valleys
of
different
length
and
breadth
all
woody
and
running
up
into
the
hills
in
all
directions
we
reached
helmsly
just
at
dusk
we
had
a
beautiful
view
of
the
castle
from
the
top
of
the
hill
and
slept
at
a
very
nice
inn
and
were
well
treated
floors
as
smooth
as
ice
on
friday
morning
july
we
walked
to
kirby
met
people
coming
to
helmsly
fair
were
misdirected
and
walked
a
mile
out
of
our
way
a
beautiful
view
above
pickering
met
mary
and
sara
seven
miles
from
sheltered
from
the
rain
beautiful
glen
spoiled
by
the
large
house
sweet
church
and
churchyard
arrived
at
gallow
hill
at
seven
evening
sara
tom
and
i
rode
up
bedale
mary
sara
and
i
went
to
scarborough
and
we
walked
in
the
abbey
pasture
and
to
wykeham
and
on
monday
the
we
went
off
with
mary
in
a
we
had
an
interesting
ride
over
the
wolds
though
it
rained
all
the
way
single
thorn
bushes
were
scattered
about
on
the
turf
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
a
little
hut
swelling
grounds
and
sometimes
a
single
tree
or
a
clump
of
trees
we
passed
through
one
or
two
little
villages
embosomed
in
tall
trees
after
we
had
parted
from
mary
there
were
gleams
of
sunshine
but
with
showers
we
saw
beverley
in
a
heavy
rain
and
yet
were
much
pleased
with
the
beauty
of
the
town
saw
the
minster
a
pretty
clean
building
but
injured
very
much
with
grecian
architecture
the
country
between
beverley
and
hull
very
rich
but
miserably
flat
brick
houses
windmills
houses
again
dull
and
endless
hull
a
frightful
dirty
brickhousey
tradesmanlike
rich
vulgar
place
yet
the
river
though
the
shores
are
so
low
that
they
can
hardly
be
seen
looked
beautiful
with
the
evening
lights
upon
it
and
boats
moving
about
we
walked
a
long
time
and
returned
to
our
dull
but
quiet
evening
one
to
supper
market
day
streets
dirty
very
rainy
did
not
leave
hull
till
four
and
left
barton
at
about
six
rained
all
the
way
almost
a
beautiful
village
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
with
trees
a
gentleman
house
converted
into
a
lady
we
left
lincoln
on
wednesday
morning
july
at
six
it
rained
heavily
and
we
could
see
nothing
but
the
antientry
of
some
of
the
buildings
as
we
passed
along
the
night
before
however
we
had
seen
enough
to
make
us
regret
this
the
minster
stands
at
the
edge
of
a
hill
overlooking
an
immense
plain
the
country
very
flat
as
we
went
along
the
day
mended
we
went
to
see
the
outside
of
the
minster
while
the
passengers
were
dining
at
peterborough
the
west
end
very
grand
on
thursday
morning
we
arrived
in
london
wm
left
me
at
the
sun
after
various
troubles
and
disasters
we
left
london
on
saturday
morning
at
five
or
six
the
of
july
we
mounted
the
dover
coach
at
charing
cross
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
the
city
paul
with
the
river
and
a
multitude
of
little
boats
made
a
most
beautiful
sight
as
we
crossed
westminster
bridge
the
houses
were
not
overhung
by
their
cloud
of
smoke
and
they
were
spread
out
endlessly
yet
the
sun
shone
so
brightly
with
such
a
fierce
light
that
there
was
even
something
like
the
purity
of
one
of
nature
own
grand
spectacles

p
ed
we
rode
on
cheerfully
now
with
the
paris
diligence
before
us
now
behind
we
walked
up
the
steep
hills
a
beautiful
prospect
everywhere
till
we
even
reached
dover
at
first
the
rich
populous
woody
country
about
london
then
the
river
thames
ships
sailing
chalk
cliffs
trees
little
villages
afterwards
canterbury
situated
on
a
plain
rich
and
woody
but
the
city
and
cathedral
disappointed
me
hop
grounds
on
each
side
of
the
road
some
miles
from
canterbury
then
we
came
to
a
common
the
race
ground
an
elevated
plain
villages
among
trees
in
the
bed
of
a
valley
at
our
right
and
rising
above
this
valley
green
hills
scattered
over
with
wood
neat
gentlemen
houses
one
white
house
almost
hid
with
green
trees
which
we
longed
for
and
the
parson
house
as
neat
a
place
as
could
be
which
would
just
have
suited
coleridge
no
doubt
we
may
have
found
one
for
tom
hutchinson
and
sara
and
a
good
farm
too
we
halted
at
a
house
fruit
carts
under
the
shade
of
trees
seats
for
guests
a
tempting
place
to
the
weary
traveller
still
as
we
went
along
the
country
was
beautiful
and
hilly
with
cottages
lurking
under
the
hills
and
their
little
plots
of
hop
ground
like
vineyards
it
was
a
bad
hop
year
a
woman
on
the
top
of
the
coach
said
to
me
it
is
a
sad
thing
for
the
poor
people
for
the
is
the
woman
harvest
there
is
employment
about
the
hops
for
women
and
children
we
saw
the
castle
of
dover
and
the
sea
beyond
four
or
five
miles
before
we
reached
it
we
looked
at
it
through
a
long
vale
the
castle
being
upon
an
eminence
as
it
seemed
at
the
end
of
this
vale
which
opened
to
the
sea
the
country
now
became
less
fertile
but
near
dover
it
seemed
more
rich
again
many
buildings
stand
on
the
flat
fields
sheltered
with
tall
trees
there
is
one
old
chapel
that
might
have
been
there
just
in
the
same
state
in
which
it
now
is
when
this
vale
was
as
retired
and
as
little
known
to
travellers
as
our
own
cumberland
mountain
wilds
thirty
years
ago
there
was
also
a
very
old
building
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
which
had
a
strange
effect
among
the
many
new
ones
that
are
springing
up
everywhere
it
seemed
odd
that
it
could
have
kept
itself
pure
in
its
ancientry
among
so
many
upstarts
it
was
near
dark
when
we
reached
dover
we
were
told
that
a
packet
was
about
to
sail
so
we
went
down
to
the
in
had
our
luggage
examined
etc
and
then
we
drank
tea
with
the
honourable
knox
and
his
tutor
we
arrived
at
calais
at
four
on
sunday
morning
the
of
july
we
stayed
in
the
vessel
till
seven
then
william
went
for
letters
at
about
eight
or
nine
we
found
out
annette
and
chez
madame
avril
dans
la
rue
de
la
tête
we
lodged
opposite
two
ladies
in
tolerably
rooms
but
badly
furnished
the
weather
was
very
hot
we
walked
by
the
almost
every
evening
with
annette
and
caroline
or
william
and
i
alone
i
had
a
bad
cold
and
could
not
bathe
at
first
but
william
did
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
as
we
walked
upon
the
sands
when
the
tide
was
low
perhaps
a
hundred
people
bathing
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
us
and
we
had
delightful
walks
after
the
heat
of
the
day
was
passed
seeing
far
off
in
the
west
the
coast
of
england
like
a
cloud
crested
with
dover
castle
which
was
but
like
the
summit
of
the
cloud
the
evening
star
and
the
glory
of
the
sky
the
reflections
in
the
water
were
more
beautiful
than
the
sky
itself
purple
waves
brighter
than
precious
stones
for
ever
melting
away
upon
the
sands
the
fort
a
wooden
building
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
at
calais
when
the
evening
twilight
was
coming
on
and
we
could
not
see
anything
of
the
building
but
its
shape
which
was
far
more
distinct
than
in
perfect
daylight
seemed
to
be
reared
upon
pillars
of
ebony
between
which
pillars
the
sea
was
seen
in
the
most
beautiful
colours
that
can
be
conceived
nothing
in
romance
was
ever
half
so
beautiful
now
came
in
view
as
the
evening
star
sunk
down
and
the
colours
of
the
west
faded
away
the
two
lights
of
england
lighted
up
by
englishmen
in
our
country
to
warn
vessels
off
rocks
or
sands
these
we
used
to
see
from
the
pier
when
we
could
see
no
other
distant
objects
but
the
clouds
the
sky
and
the
sea
itself
all
was
dark
behind
the
town
of
calais
seemed
deserted
of
the
light
of
heaven
but
there
was
always
light
and
life
and
joy
upon
the
sea
one
night
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
had
been
very
hot
and
william
and
i
walked
alone
together
upon
the
pier
the
sea
was
gloomy
for
there
was
a
blackness
over
all
the
sky
except
when
it
was
overspread
with
lightning
which
often
revealed
to
us
a
distant
vessel
near
as
the
waves
roared
and
broke
against
the
pier
and
they
were
interfused
with
greenish
fiery
light
the
more
distant
sea
always
black
and
gloomy
it
was
also
beautiful
on
the
calm
hot
night
to
see
the
little
boats
row
out
of
harbour
with
wings
of
fire
and
the
sail
boats
with
the
fiery
track
which
they
cut
as
they
went
along
and
which
closed
up
after
them
with
a
hundred
thousand
sparkles
and
streams
of
light
caroline
was
delighted

the
next
day
was
very
hot
we
bathed
and
sate
upon
the
dover
cliffs
and
looked
upon
france
with
many
a
melancholy
and
tender
thought
we
could
see
the
shores
almost
as
plain
as

after

are
coming
this
forced
me
from
the
bed
where
i
lay
and
i
moved
i
knew
not
how
straight
forward
faster
than
my
strength
could
carry
me
till
i
met
my
beloved
william
and
fell
upon
his
bosom
he
and
john
hutchinson
led
me
to
the
house
and
there
i
stayed
to
welcome
my
dear
mary
as
soon
as
we
had
breakfasted
we
departed
it
rained
when
we
set
off
poor
mary
was
much
agitated
when
she
parted
from
her
brothers
and
sisters
and
her
home
nothing
particular
occurred
till
we
reached
kirby
we
had
sunshine
and
showers
pleasant
talk
love
and
cheerfulness
we
were
obliged
to
stay
two
hours
at
while
the
horses
were
feeding
we
wrote
a
few
lines
to
sara
and
then
walked
out
the
sun
shone
and
we
went
to
the
churchyard
after
we
had
put
a
letter
into
the
for
the
we
sauntered
about
and
read
the
there
was
one
to
the
memory
of
five
children
who
had
all
died
within
five
years
and
the
longest
lived
had
only
lived
four
years
footnote
it
may
not
be
a
too
trivial
detail
to
note
that
coleridge
an
appeared
in
morning
on
wordsworth
marriage
ed
we
left
kirby
at
about
two
there
is
not
much
variety
of
prospect
from
to
helmsley
but
the
country
is
very
pleasant
being
rich
and
woody
and
helmsley
itself
stands
very
sweetly
at
the
foot
of
the
rising
grounds
of
duncombe
park
which
is
scattered
over
with
tall
woods
and
lifting
itself
above
the
common
buildings
of
the
town
stands
helmsley
castle
now
a
ruin
formerly
inhabited
by
the
gay
duke
of
buckingham
every
foot
of
the
road
was
of
itself
interesting
to
us
for
we
had
travelled
along
it
on
foot
william
and
i
when
we
went
to
fetch
our
dear
mary
and
had
sate
upon
the
turf
by
the
roadside
more
than
once
before
we
reached
helmsley
our
driver
told
us
that
he
could
not
take
us
any
further
so
we
stopped
at
the
same
inn
where
we
had
slept
before
my
heart
danced
at
the
sight
of
its
cleanly
outside
bright
yellow
walls
casements
overshadowed
with
jasmine
and
its
low
double
front
mary
and
i
warmed
ourselves
at
the
kitchen
fire
we
then
walked
into
the
garden
and
looked
over
a
gate
up
to
the
old
ruin
which
stands
at
the
top
of
the
mount
and
round
about
it
the
moats
are
grown
up
into
soft
green
cradles
hollows
surrounded
with
green
grassy
hillocks
and
these
are
overshadowed
by
old
trees
chiefly
ashes
i
prevailed
upon
william
to
go
up
with
me
to
the
ruins
the
sun
shone
it
was
warm
and
very
pleasant
one
part
of
the
castle
seems
to
be
inhabited
there
was
a
man
mowing
nettles
in
the
open
space
which
had
most
likely
once
been
the
there
is
one
gateway
exceedingly
beautiful
children
were
playing
upon
the
sloping
ground
we
came
home
by
the
street
after
about
an
hour
delay
we
set
forward
again
had
an
excellent
driver
who
opened
the
gates
so
dexterously
that
the
horses
never
stopped
mary
was
very
much
delighted
with
the
view
of
the
castle
from
the
point
where
we
had
seen
it
before
i
was
pleased
to
see
again
the
little
path
which
we
had
walked
upon
the
gate
i
had
climbed
over
and
the
road
down
which
we
had
seen
the
two
little
boys
drag
a
log
of
wood
and
a
team
of
horses
struggle
under
the
weight
of
a
great
load
of
timber
we
had
felt
compassion
for
the
poor
horses
that
were
under
the
governance
of
oppression
and
drivers
and
for
the
poor
boys
who
seemed
of
an
age
to
have
been
able
to
have
dragged
the
log
of
wood
merely
out
of
the
love
of
their
own
activity
but
from
poverty
and
bad
food
they
panted
for
weakness
and
were
obliged
to
fetch
their
father
from
the
town
to
help
them
duncombe
house
looks
well
from
the
road
a
large
building
though
i
believe
only
of
the
original
design
are
completed
we
rode
down
a
very
steep
hill
to
rivaux
valley
with
woods
all
round
us
we
stopped
upon
the
bridge
to
look
at
the
abbey
and
again
when
we
had
crossed
it
dear
mary
had
never
seen
a
ruined
abbey
before
except
whitby
we
recognised
the
cottages
houses
and
the
little
valleys
as
we
went
along
we
walked
up
a
long
hill
the
road
carrying
us
up
the
cleft
or
valley
with
woody
hills
on
each
side
of
us
when
we
went
to
i
had
walked
down
the
valley
alone
william
followed
me
before
we
had
crossed
the
hambledon
hill
and
reached
the
point
overlooking
yorkshire
it
was
quite
dark
we
had
not
wanted
however
fair
prospects
before
us
as
we
drove
along
the
flat
plain
of
the
high
hill
far
far
off
from
us
in
the
western
sky
we
saw
shapes
of
castles
ruins
among
groves
a
great
spreading
wood
rocks
and
single
trees
a
minster
with
its
tower
unusually
distinct
minarets
in
another
quarter
and
a
round
grecian
temple
also
the
colours
of
the
sky
of
a
bright
grey
and
the
forms
of
a
sober
grey
with
a
dome
as
we
descended
the
hill
there
was
no
distinct
view
but
of
a
great
space
only
near
us
we
saw
the
wild
and
as
the
people
say
bottomless
tarn
in
the
hollow
at
the
side
of
the
hill
it
seemed
to
be
made
visible
to
us
only
by
its
own
light
for
all
the
hill
about
us
was
dark
before
we
reached
thirsk
we
saw
a
light
before
us
which
we
at
first
thought
was
the
moon
then
but
when
we
drove
into
the
it
proved
a
large
bonfire
with
lads
dancing
round
it
which
is
a
sight
i
dearly
love
the
inn
was
like
an
illuminated
house
every
room
full
we
asked
the
cause
and
were
told
by
the
girl
that
it
was
john
bell
birthday
that
he
had
heired
his
estate
the
landlady
was
very
civil
she
did
not
recognise
the
despised
we
rode
on
in
the
dark
and
reached
leeming
lane
at
eleven
the
next
morning
we
set
off
at
about
eight
it
was
a
cheerful
sunny
morning
we
had
a
few
showers
but
when
we
came
to
the
green
fields
of
wensley
the
sun
shone
upon
them
all
and
the
ure
in
its
many
windings
glittered
as
it
flowed
along
under
the
green
slopes
of
middleham
castle
mary
looked
about
for
her
friend
place
and
thought
she
had
him
sure
on
the
contrary
side
of
the
vale
from
that
on
which
we
afterwards
found
he
lived
we
went
to
a
new
built
house
at
leyburn
the
same
village
where
william
and
i
had
dined
on
our
road
to
grasmere
two
years
and
ago
but
not
the
same
house
the
landlady
was
very
civil
giving
us
cake
and
wine
but
the
horses
being
out
we
were
detained
at
least
two
hours
and
did
not
set
off
till
two
we
paid
for
miles
to
sedbergh
but
the
landlady
did
not
encourage
us
to
hope
to
get
beyond
hawes
when
we
passed
through
the
village
of
wensley
my
heart
melted
away
with
dear
recollections
the
bridge
the
little
waterspout
the
steep
hill
the
church
they
are
among
the
most
vivid
of
my
own
inner
visions
for
they
were
the
first
objects
that
i
saw
after
we
were
left
to
ourselves
and
had
turned
our
whole
hearts
to
grasmere
as
a
home
in
which
we
were
to
rest
the
vale
looked
most
beautiful
each
way
to
the
left
the
bright
silver
stream
inlaid
the
flat
and
very
green
meadows
winding
like
a
serpent
to
the
right
we
did
not
see
it
so
far
it
was
lost
among
trees
and
little
hills
i
could
not
help
observing
as
we
went
along
how
much
more
varied
the
prospects
of
wensley
dale
are
in
the
summer
time
than
i
could
have
thought
possible
in
the
winter
this
seemed
to
be
in
great
measure
owing
to
the
trees
being
in
leaf
and
forming
groves
and
screens
and
thence
little
openings
upon
recesses
and
concealed
retreats
which
in
winter
only
made
a
part
of
the
one
great
vale
the
beauty
of
the
summer
time
here
as
much
excels
that
of
the
winter
as
the
variety
owing
to
the
excessive
greenness
of
the
fields
and
the
trees
in
leaf
half
concealing
and
where
they
do
not
conceal
softening
the
hard
bareness
of
the
limey
white
roofs
one
of
our
horses
seemed
to
grow
a
little
restive
as
we
went
through
the
first
village
a
long
village
on
the
side
of
a
hill
it
grew
worse
and
worse
and
at
last
we
durst
not
go
on
any
longer
we
walked
a
while
and
then
the
post
boy
was
obliged
to
take
the
horse
out
and
go
back
for
another
we
seated
ourselves
again
snugly
in
the
the
wind
struggled
about
us
and
rattled
the
window
and
gave
a
gentle
motion
to
the
chaise
but
we
were
warm
and
at
our
ease
within
our
station
was
at
the
top
of
a
hill
opposite
bolton
castle
the
ure
flowing
beneath
william
has
since
written
a
sonnet
on
this
our
imprisonment
hard
was
thy
durance
poor
queen
mary
compared
with
ours
footnote
this
sonnet
was
not
thought
worthy
of
being
ed
we
had
a
sweet
ride
till
we
came
to
a
on
the
side
of
a
hill
where
we
alighted
and
walked
down
to
see
the
waterfalls
the
sun
was
not
set
and
the
woods
and
fields
were
spread
over
with
the
yellow
light
of
evening
which
made
their
greenness
a
thousand
times
more
green
there
was
too
much
water
in
the
river
for
the
beauty
of
the
falls
and
even
the
banks
were
less
interesting
than
in
winter
nature
had
entirely
got
the
better
in
her
struggles
against
the
giants
who
first
cast
the
mould
of
these
works
for
indeed
it
is
a
place
that
did
not
in
winter
remind
one
of
god
but
one
could
not
help
feeling
as
if
there
had
been
the
agency
of
some
mortal
instruments
which
nature
had
been
struggling
against
without
making
a
perfect
conquest
there
was
something
so
wild
and
new
in
this
feeling
knowing
as
we
did
in
the
inner
man
that
god
alone
had
laid
his
hand
upon
it
that
i
could
not
help
regretting
the
want
of
it
besides
it
is
a
pleasure
to
a
real
lover
of
nature
to
give
winter
all
the
glory
he
can
for
summer
make
its
own
way
and
speak
its
own
praises
we
saw
the
pathway
which
william
and
i
took
at
the
close
of
evening
the
path
leading
to
the
rabbit
warren
where
we
lost
ourselves
sloe
farm
with
its
holly
hedges
was
lost
among
the
green
hills
and
hedgerows
in
general
but
we
found
it
out
and
were
glad
to
look
at
it
again
william
left
us
to
seek
the
waterfalls
at
our
return
to
the
inn
we
found
new
horses
and
a
new
driver
and
we
went
on
nicely
to
hawes
where
we
arrived
before
it
was
quite
dark
we
rose
at
six
a
rainy
morning
there
was
a
very
fine
view
about
a
mile
from
hawes
where
we
crossed
a
bridge
bare
and
very
green
fields
with
cattle
a
glittering
stream
cottages
a
few
trees
and
high
hills
the
sun
shone
now
before
we
got
upon
the
bare
hills
there
was
a
hunting
lodge
on
our
right
exactly
like
greta
hill
with
fir
plantations
about
it
we
were
very
fortunate
in
the
day
gleams
of
sunshine
passing
clouds
that
travelled
with
their
shadows
below
them
mary
was
much
pleased
with
garsdale
it
was
a
dear
place
to
william
and
me
we
noted
well
the
garsdale
hall
where
we
had
baited
and
afterwards
the
mountain
which
had
been
adorned
by
jupiter
in
his
glory
when
we
were
here
before
it
was
midday
when
we
reached
sedbergh
and
market
day
we
were
in
the
same
room
where
we
had
spent
the
evening
together
in
our
road
to
grasmere
we
had
a
pleasant
ride
to
kendal
where
we
arrived
at
two
the
day
favoured
us
and
i
went
to
see
the
house
where
dear
sara
had
lived
i
am
always
glad
to
see
staveley
it
is
a
place
i
dearly
love
to
think
of
the
first
mountain
village
that
i
came
to
with
william
when
we
first
began
our
pilgrimage
together
nothing
particular
occurred
till
we
reached
ings
chapel
the
door
was
open
and
we
went
in
it
is
a
neat
little
place
with
a
marble
floor
and
marble
communion
table
with
a
painting
over
it
of
the
last
supper
and
moses
and
aaron
on
each
side
the
woman
told
us
that
they
had
painted
them
as
near
as
they
could
by
the
dresses
as
they
are
described
in
the
bible
and
gay
enough
they
are
the
marble
had
been
sent
by
richard
bateman
from
leghorn
the
woman
told
us
that
a
man
had
been
at
her
house
a
few
days
before
who
told
her
he
had
helped
to
bring
it
down
the
red
sea
and
she
believed
him
gladly
we
arrived
at
grasmere
at
about
six
on
wednesday
evening
the
of
october
i
can
not
describe
what
i
felt
we
went
by
candle
light
into
the
garden
and
were
astonished
at
the
growth
of
the
brooms
portugal
laurels
etc
etc
etc
the
next
day
thursday
we
unpacked
the
boxes
on
friday
mary
and
i
walked
first
upon
the
and
then
in
john
grove
then
in
view
of
rydale
the
first
walk
that
i
had
taken
with
my
sister
a
beautiful
day
we
walked
to
the
easedale
hills
to
hunt
waterfalls
william
and
mary
left
me
sitting
on
a
stone
on
the
solitary
mountains
and
went
to
easedale
tarn
the
approach
to
the
tarn
is
very
beautiful
we
expected
to
have
found
coleridge
at
home
but
he
did
not
come
till
after
dinner
he
was
well
but
did
not
look
so
we
walked
with
coleridge
to
rydale
set
forwards
with
him
towards
keswick
and
he
prevailed
us
to
go
on
we
consented
not
being
at
home
the
day
was
delightful
we
went
in
the
evening
to
calvert
moonlight
stayed

came
home
mary
and
william
returned
to
coleridge
before
we
reached

i
had
a
pleasant
walk
the
day

very
bright
the
people
busy
getting
in
their
corn

thirteen
of
our
neighbours
to

gone
to
keswick
mary
went
with
him
to
the
top
of
the
raise
she
is
returned
and
is
now
sitting
near
me
by
the
fire
it
is
a
breathless
grey
day
that
leaves
the
golden
woods
of
autumn
quiet
in
their
own
tranquillity
stately
and
beautiful
in
their
decaying
the
lake
is
a
perfect
mirror
william

william
and
went
to
keswick
mary
and
i
walked
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
looked
at
rydale
i
was
much
affected
when
i
stood
upon
the
second
bar
of
sara
gate
the
lake
was
perfectly
still
the
sun
shone
on
hill
and
vale
the
distant
birch
trees
looked
like
large
golden
flowers
nothing
else
in
colour
was
distinct
and
separate
but
all
the
beautiful
colours
seemed
to
be
melted
into
one
another
and
joined
together
in
one
mass
so
that
there
were
no
differences
though
an
endless
variety
when
one
tried
to
find
it
out
the
fields
were
of
one
sober
yellow
brown
footnote

should
have
been

delightful
that
it
made
my
very
heart
long
to
be
out
of
doors
and
see
and
feel
the
beauty
of
the
autumn
in
freedom
the
trees
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
are
of
a
yellow
brown
but
there
are
one
or
two
trees
opposite
our
windows
an
ash
tree
for
instance
quite
green
as
in
spring
the
fields
are
of
their
winter
colour
but
the
island
is
as
green
as
ever
it
was
william
is
writing
out
his
stanzas
from
ariosto
the
evening
is
quiet
poor
coleridge
sara
is
at
keswick
i
hope
i
have
read
one
canto
of
ariosto
christmas
eve
william
is
now
sitting
by
me
at
ten
i
have
been
repeating
some
of
his
sonnets
to
him
listening
to
his
own
repeating
reading
some
of
milton
and
the
and
it
is
a
quick
keen
frost
coleridge
came
this
morning
with
wedgwood
we
all
turned
out
one
by
one
to
meet
him
he
looked
well
we
had
to
tell
him
of
the
birth
of
his
little
girl
born
yesterday
morning
at
six
william
went
with
them
to
wytheburn
in
the
chaise
and
and
i
met
on
the
raise
it
was
not
an
unpleasant
morning
the
sun
shone
now
and
then
and
there
was
no
wind
but
all
things
looked
cheerless
and
distinct
no
meltings
of
sky
into
mountains
the
mountains
like
stone
work
wrought
up
with
huge
hammers
last
sunday
was
as
mild
a
day
as
i
ever
remember
mary
and
i
went
round
the
lakes
there
were
flowers
of
various
kinds
the
topmost
bell
of
a
foxglove
geraniums
daisies
a
buttercup
in
the
water
but
this
i
saw
two
or
three
days
before
small
yellow
flowers
i
do
not
know
their
name
in
the
turf
a
large
bunch
of
strawberry
blossoms
it
is
christmas
day
saturday
december
i
am
years
of
age
it
is
a
dull
frosty
day
on
thursday
december
i
went
to
keswick
william
rode
before
me
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
nearest
there
we
parted
close
to
a
little
watercourse
which
was
then
noisy
with
water
but
on
my
return
a
dry
channel
we
stopped
our
horse
close
to
the
ledge
opposite
a
tuft
of
primroses
three
flowers
in
full
blossom
and
a
bud
they
reared
themselves
up
among
the
green
moss
we
debated
long
whether
we
should
pluck
them
and
at
last
left
them
to
live
out
their
day
which
i
was
right
glad
of
at
my
return
the
sunday
following
for
there
they
remained
uninjured
either
by
cold
or
wet
i
stayed
at
keswick
over
new
year
day
and
returned
on
sunday
the
january
william
was
alarmed
at
my
long
delay
and
came
to
within
three
miles
of
keswick
coleridge
stayed
with
us
till
tuesday
january
and
i
walked
with
him
to
ambleside
we
parted
with
him
at
the
turning
of
the
lane
he
going
on
horseback
to
the
top
of
kirkstone
on
thursday
returned
and
on
friday
the
he
and
sara
went
to
keswick
accompanied
them
to
the
foot
of
wytheburn
it
was
a
gentle
day
and
when
william
and
i
returned
home
just
before
sunset
it
was
a
heavenly
evening
a
soft
sky
was
among
the
hills
and
a
summer
sunshine
above
and
blending
with
this
sky
for
it
was
more
like
sky
than
clouds
the
turf
looked
warm
and
soft
january
i
lay
in
bed
to
have
a
drench
of
sleep
till
one
worked
all
day
ominously
cold
january
a
very
cold
day
but
the
blackness
of
the
cold
made
us
slow
to
put
forward
and
we
did
not
walk
at
all
mary
read
the
prologue

recollections
of
a
tour
made
in
scotland
william
and
i
parted
from
mary
on
sunday
afternoon
august
and
william
coleridge
and
i
left
keswick
on
monday
morning
the
at
twenty
minutes
after
eleven
the
day
was
very
hot
we
walked
up
the
hills
and
along
all
the
rough
road
which
made
our
walking
half
the
day
journey
travelled
under
the
foot
of
carrock
a
mountain
covered
with
stones
on
the
lower
part
above
it
is
very
rocky
but
sheep
pasture
there
we
saw
several
where
there
seemed
to
be
no
grass
to
tempt
them
passed
the
foot
of
grisdale
and
mosedale
both
pastoral
valleys
narrow
and
soon
terminating
in
the
mountains
green
with
scattered
trees
and
houses
and
each
a
beautiful
stream
at
grisdale
our
horse
backed
upon
a
steep
bank
where
the
road
was
not
fenced
just
above
a
pretty
mill
at
the
foot
of
the
valley
and
we
had
a
second
threatening
of
a
disaster
in
crossing
a
narrow
bridge
between
the
two
dales
but
this
was
not
the
fault
of
either
man
or
horse
slept
at
younghusband
hesket
newmarket
in
the
evening
walked
to
caldbeck
falls
a
delicious
spot
in
which
to
breathe
out
a
day
limestone
rocks
hanging
trees
pools
and
caves
and
caldrons
which
have
been
honoured
with
fairy
names
and
no
doubt
continue
in
the
fancy
of
the
neighbourhood
to
resound
with
fairy
revels
august
passed
rose
castle
upon
the
caldew
an
ancient
building
of
red
stone
with
sloping
gardens
an
ivied
gateway
velvet
lawns
old
garden
walls
trim
with
stately
and
luxuriant
flowers
we
walked
up
to
the
house
and
stood
some
minutes
watching
the
swallows
that
flew
about
restlessly
and
flung
their
shadows
upon
the
sunbright
walls
of
the
old
building
the
shadows
glanced
and
twinkled
interchanged
and
crossed
each
other
expanded
and
shrunk
up
appeared
and
disappeared
every
instant
as
i
observed
to
william
and
coleridge
seeming
more
like
living
things
than
the
birds
themselves
dined
at
carlisle
the
town
in
a
bustle
with
the
assizes
so
many
strange
faces
known
in
former
times
and
recognised
that
it
half
seemed
as
if
i
ought
to
know
them
all
and
together
with
the
noise
the
fine
ladies
they
put
me
into
confusion
this
day
hatfield
was
condemned
i
stood
at
the
door
of
the
gaoler
house
where
he
was
william
entered
the
house
and
coleridge
saw
him
i
fell
into
conversation
with
a
debtor
who
told
me
in
a
dry
way
that
he
was
far
and
another
man
observed
to
william
that
we
might
learn
from
hatfield
fate
not
to
meddle
with
pen
and
ink
we
gave
a
shilling
to
my
companion
whom
we
found
out
to
be
a
friend
of
the
family
a
with
my
brother
john
in
captain
wordsworth
ship
walked
upon
the
city
walls
which
are
broken
down
in
places
and
crumbling
away
and
most
disgusting
from
filth
the
city
and
neighbourhood
of
carlisle
disappointed
me
the
banks
of
the
river
quite
flat
and
though
the
holms
are
rich
there
is
not
much
beauty
in
the
vale
from
the
want
of
trees
at
least
to
the
eye
of
a
person
coming
from
england
and
i
scarcely
know
how
but
to
me
the
holms
had
not
a
look
there
was
something
townish
in
their
appearance
a
dulness
in
their
strong
deep
green
to
longtown
not
very
interesting
except
from
the
long
views
over
the
flat
country
the
road
rough
chiefly
newly
mended
reached
longtown
after
sunset
a
town
of
brick
houses
belonging
chiefly
to
the
graham
family
being
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
not
long
it
had
been
better
called
crosstown
there
are
several
shops
and
it
is
not
a
very
small
place
but
i
could
not
meet
with
a
silver
thimble
and
bought
a
brass
one
slept
at
the
graham
arms
a
large
inn
here
as
everywhere
else
the
people
seemed
utterly
insensible
of
the
enormity
of
hatfield
offences
the
ostler
told
william
that
he
was
quite
a
gentleman
paid
every
one
genteelly
etc
etc
he
and
mary
had
walked
together
to
gretna
green
a
heavy
rain
came
on
when
they
were
there
a
returned
chaise
happened
to
pass
and
the
driver
would
have
taken
them
up
but
hope
carriage
was
to
be
sent
for
he
did
not
choose
to
accept
the
offer
august
left
longtown
after
breakfast
about
half
a
mile
from
the
town
a
guidepost
and
two
roads
to
edinburgh
and
glasgow
we
took
the
road
to
glasgow
here
saw
a
specimen
of
the
luxuriance
of
the
as
it
grows
in
scotland
it
was
in
the
enclosed
plantations
perhaps
sheltered
by
them
these
plantations
appeared
to
be
not
well
grown
for
their
age
the
trees
were
stunted
afterwards
the
road
treeless
over
a
common
the
solway
moss
here
and
there
an
hut
with
its
peat
stack
a
scanty
growing
willow
hedge
round
the
perhaps
the
cow
pasturing
near
a
little
lass
watching
it
the
dreary
waste
cheered
by
the
endless
singing
of
larks
we
enter
scotland
by
crossing
the
river
sark
on
the
scotch
side
of
the
bridge
the
ground
is
unenclosed
pasturage
it
was
very
green
and
scattered
over
with
that
yellow
flowered
plant
which
we
call
grunsel
the
hills
heave
and
swell
prettily
enough
cattle
feeding
a
few
corn
fields
near
the
river
at
the
top
of
the
hill
opposite
is
springfield
a
village
built
by
sir
william
maxwell
a
dull
uniformity
in
the
houses
as
is
usual
when
all
built
at
one
time
or
belonging
to
one
individual
each
just
big
enough
for
two
people
to
live
in
and
in
which
a
family
large
or
small
as
it
may
happen
is
crammed
there
the
marriages
are
performed
further
on
though
almost
contiguous
is
gretna
green
upon
a
hill
and
among
trees
this
sounds
well
but
it
is
a
dreary
place
the
stone
houses
dirty
and
miserable
with
broken
windows
there
is
a
pleasant
view
from
the
churchyard
over
solway
firth
to
the
cumberland
mountains
dined
at
annan
on
our
left
as
we
travelled
along
appeared
the
solway
firth
and
the
mountains
beyond
but
the
near
country
dreary
those
houses
by
the
roadside
which
are
built
of
stone
are
comfortless
and
dirty
but
we
peeped
into
a
clay
biggin
that
was
very
canny
and
i
daresay
will
be
as
warm
as
a
swallow
nest
in
winter
the
town
of
annan
made
me
think
of
france
and
germany
many
of
the
houses
large
and
gloomy
the
size
of
them
outrunning
the
comforts
one
thing
which
was
like
germany
pleased
me
the
shopkeepers
express
their
calling
by
some
device
or
painting
have
biscuits
loaves
cakes
painted
on
their
blacksmiths
horses
shoes
iron
tools
etc
etc
and
so
on
through
all
trades
reached
dumfries
at
about
nine
met
crowds
of
people
on
the
road
and
every
one
had
a
smile
for
us
and
our
car
the
inn
was
a
large
house
and
tolerably
comfortable
rogers
and
his
sister
whom
we
had
seen
at
our
own
cottage
at
grasmere
a
few
days
before
had
arrived
there
that
same
afternoon
on
their
way
to
the
highlands
but
we
did
not
see
them
till
the
next
morning
and
only
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
august
went
to
the
churchyard
where
burns
is
buried
a
bookseller
accompanied
us
he
showed
us
the
outside
of
burns
house
where
he
had
lived
the
last
three
years
of
his
life
and
where
he
died
it
has
a
mean
appearance
and
is
in
a
bye
situation
whitewashed
dirty
about
the
doors
as
almost
all
scotch
houses
are
flowering
plants
in
the
windows
went
on
to
visit
his
grave
he
lies
at
a
corner
of
the
churchyard
and
his
second
son
francis
wallace
beside
him
there
is
no
stone
to
mark
the
spot
but
a
hundred
guineas
have
been
collected
to
be
expended
on
some
sort
of
monument
there
said
the
bookseller
pointing
to
a
pompous
monument
there
lies
i
have
forgotten
his
name
a
remarkably
clever
man
he
was
an
attorney
and
hardly
ever
lost
a
cause
he
undertook
burns
made
many
a
lampoon
upon
him
and
there
they
rest
as
you
see
we
looked
at
the
grave
with
melancholy
and
painful
reflections
repeating
to
each
other
his
own
verses
is
there
a
man
whose
judgment
clear
can
others
teach
the
course
to
steer
yet
runs
himself
life
mad
career
wild
as
the
wave
here
let
him
pause
and
through
a
tear
survey
this
grave
the
poor
inhabitant
below
was
quick
to
learn
and
wise
to
know
and
keenly
felt
the
friendly
glow
and
softer
flame
but
thoughtless
follies
laid
him
low
and
stain
his
name
the
churchyard
is
full
of
and
expensive
monuments
in
all
sorts
of
fantastic
shapes
etc
in
speaking
of
gretna
green
i
forgot
to
mention
that
we
visited
the
churchyard
the
church
is
like
a
huge
house
indeed
so
are
all
the
churches
with
a
steeple
not
a
square
tower
or
spire
a
sort
of
thing
more
like
a
chimney
than
a
church
of
england
steeple
in
abundance
few
verses
yet
there
were
some
no
texts
over
the
graves
of
married
women
the
maiden
name
instead
of
that
of
the
husband
spouse
instead
of
wife
and
the
place
of
abode
preceded
by
in
instead
of
of
when
our
guide
had
left
us
we
turned
again
to
burns
house
burns
was
gone
to
spend
some
time
by
the
with
her
children
we
spoke
to
the
at
the
door
who
invited
us
forward
and
we
sate
down
in
the
parlour
the
walls
were
coloured
with
a
blue
wash
on
one
side
of
the
fire
was
a
mahogany
desk
opposite
to
the
window
a
clock
and
over
the
desk
a
print
from
the
saturday
which
burns
mentions
in
one
of
his
letters
having
received
as
a
present
the
house
was
cleanly
and
neat
in
the
inside
the
stairs
of
stone
scoured
white
the
kitchen
on
the
right
side
of
the
passage
the
parlour
on
the
left
in
the
room
above
the
parlour
the
poet
died
and
his
son
after
him
in
the
same
room
the
servant
told
us
she
had
lived
five
years
with
burns
who
was
now
in
great
sorrow
for
the
death
of
wallace
she
said
that
burns
youngest
son
was
at
christ
hospital
we
were
glad
to
leave
dumfries
which
is
no
agreeable
place
to
them
who
do
not
love
the
bustle
of
a
town
that
seems
to
be
rising
up
to
wealth
we
could
think
of
little
else
but
poor
burns
and
his
moving
about
on
that
unpoetic
ground
in
our
road
to
brownhill
the
next
stage
we
passed
ellisland
at
a
little
distance
on
our
right
his
farmhouse
we
might
there
have
had
more
pleasure
in
looking
round
if
we
had
been
nearer
to
the
spot
but
there
is
no
thought
surviving
in
connexion
with
burns
daily
life
that
is
not
travelled
through
the
vale
of
nith
here
little
like
a
vale
it
is
so
broad
with
irregular
hills
rising
up
on
each
side
in
outline
resembling
the
valances
of
a
bed
there
is
a
great
deal
of
arable
land
the
corn
ripe
trees
here
and
there
plantations
clumps
coppices
and
a
newness
in
everything
so
much
of
the
gorse
and
broom
rooted
out
that
you
wonder
why
it
is
not
all
gone
and
yet
there
seems
to
be
almost
as
much
gorse
and
broom
as
corn
and
they
grow
one
among
another
you
know
not
how
crossed
the

very
pleasant

the

with
woody
banks
left
the
nith
about
a
mile
and
a
half
and
reached
brownhill
a
lonely
inn
where
we
slept
the
view
from
the
windows
was
pleasing
though
some
travellers
might
have
been
disposed
to
quarrel
with
it
for
its
general
nakedness
yet
there
was
abundance
of
corn
it
is
an
open
country
open
yet
all
over
hills
at
a
little
distance
were
many
cottages
among
trees
that
looked
very
pretty
brownhill
is
about
seven
or
eight
miles
from
ellisland
i
fancied
to
myself
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
parlour
that
burns
might
have
caroused
there
for
most
likely
his
rounds
extended
so
far
and
this
thought
gave
a
melancholy
interest
to
the
smoky
walls
it
was
as
pretty
a
room
as
a
thoroughly
dirty
one
could
be
a
square
parlour
painted
green
but
so
covered
over
with
smoke
and
dirt
that
it
looked
not
unlike
green
seen
through
black
gauze
there
were
three
windows
looking
three
ways
a
buffet
ornamented
with
a
superfine
largeish
with
gilt
ornaments
spreading
far
and
wide
the
glass
spotted
with
dirt
some
ordinary
alehouse
pictures
and
above
the
a
print
in
a
much
better
style
as
william
guessed
taken
from
a
painting
by
sir
joshua
reynolds
of
some
lady
of
quality
in
the
character
of
euphrosyne
ay
said
the
seeing
that
we
looked
at
it
there
many
travellers
would
give
a
deal
for
that
it
more
admired
than
any
in
the
house
we
could
not
but
smile
for
the
rest
were
such
as
may
be
found
in
the
basket
of

william
and
i
walked
out
after
dinner
coleridge
was
not
well
and
slept
upon
the
carriage
cushions
we
made
our
way
to
the
cottages
among
the
little
hills
and
knots
of
wood
and
then
saw
what
a
delightful
country
this
part
of
scotland
might
be
made
by
planting
forest
trees
the
ground
all
over
heaves
and
swells
like
a
sea
but
for
miles
there
are
neither
trees
nor
hedgerows
only
mound
fences
and
tracts
or
slips
of
corn
potatoes
clover
with
hay
between
and
barren
land
but
near
the
cottages
many
hills
and
hillocks
covered
with
wood
we
passed
some
fine
trees
and
paused
under
the
shade
of
one
close
by
an
old
mansion
that
seemed
from
its
neglected
state
to
be
inhabited
by
farmers
but
i
must
say
that
many
of
the
gentlemen
houses
which
we
have
passed
in
scotland
have
an
air
of
neglect
and
even
of
desolation
it
was
a
beech
in
the
full
glory
of
complete
and
perfect
growth
very
tall
with
one
thick
stem
mounting
to
a
considerable
height
which
was
split
into
four
thighs
as
coleridge
afterwards
called
them
each
in
size
a
fine
tree
passed
another
mansion
now
tenanted
by
a
schoolmaster
many
boys
playing
upon
the
lawn
i
can
not
take
leave
of
the
country
which
we
passed
through
without
mentioning
that
we
saw
the
cumberland
mountains
within
half
a
mile
of
ellisland
house
the
last
view
we
had
of
them
drayton
has
prettily
described
the
connexion
which
this
neighbourhood
has
with
ours

these
lines
recurred
to
william
memory
and
we
talked
of
burns
and
of
the
prospect
he
must
have
had
perhaps
from
his
own
door
of
skiddaw
and
his
companions
indulging
ourselves
in
the
fancy
that
we
have
been
personally
known
to
each
other
and
he
have
looked
upon
those
objects
with
more
pleasure
for
our
sakes
we
talked
of
children
and
family
then
at
the
foot
of
skiddaw
and
our
own
john
a
few
miles
behind
it
while
the
grave
of
burns
son
which
we
had
just
seen
by
the
side
of
his
father
and
some
stories
heard
at
dumfries
respecting
the
dangers
his
surviving
children
were
exposed
to
filled
us
with
melancholy
concern
which
had
a
kind
of
connexion
with
ourselves
in
recollection
of
this
william
long
afterwards
wrote
the
following
address
to
the

of

august
open
country
for
a
considerable
way
passed
through
the
village
of
thornhill
built
by
the
duke
of
oueensberry
the
so
small
that
they
might
have
been
built
to
stamp
a
character
of
insolent
pride
on
his
own
huge
mansion
of
drumlanrigg
which
is
full
in
view
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
nith
this
mansion
is
indeed
very
large
but
to
us
it
appeared
like
a
gathering
together
of
little
things
the
roof
is
broken
into
a
hundred
pieces
cupolas
in
the
shape
of
casters
conjuror
balls
cups
and
the
like
the
situation
would
be
noble
if
the
woods
had
been
left
standing
but
they
have
been
cut
down
not
long
ago
and
the
hills
above
and
below
the
house
are
quite
bare
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
drumlanrigg
is
a
turnpike
gate
at
the
top
of
a
hill
we
left
our
car
with
the
man
and
turned
aside
into
a
field
where
we
looked
down
upon
the
nith
which
runs
far
below
in
a
deep
and
rocky
channel
the
banks
woody
the
view
pleasant
down
the
river
towards
thornhill
an
open
country
corn
fields
pastures
and
scattered
trees
returned
to
the
turnpike
house
a
cold
spot
upon
a
common
black
cattle
feeding
close
to
the
door
our
road
led
us
down
the
hill
to
the
side
of
the
nith
and
we
travelled
along
its
banks
for
some
miles
here
were
clay
cottages
perhaps
every
half
or
quarter
of
a
mile
the
bed
of
the
stream
rough
with
rocks
banks
irregular
now
woody
now
bare
here
a
patch
of
broom
there
of
corn
then
of
pasturage
and
hills
green
or
heathy
above
we
were
to
have
given
our
horse
meal
and
water
at
a
in
one
of
the
hamlets
we
passed
through
but
missed
the
house
for
as
is
common
in
scotland
it
was
without
a
travelled
on
still
beside
the
nith
till
we
came
to
a
turnpike
house
which
stood
rather
high
on
the
and
from
the
door
we
looked
a
long
way
up
and
down
the
river
the
air
coldish
the
wind
strong
we
asked
the
turnpike
man
to
let
us
have
some
meal
and
water
he
had
no
meal
but
luckily
we
had
part
of
a
feed
of
corn
brought
from
keswick
and
he
procured
some
hay
at
a
neighbouring
house
in
the
meantime
i
went
into
the
house
where
was
an
old
man
with
a
grey
plaid
over
his
shoulders
reading
a
newspaper
on
the
shelf
lay
a
volume
of
the
scotch
encyclopædia
a
history
of
england
and
some
other
books
the
old
man
was
a
caller
by
the
way
the
man
of
the
house
came
back
and
we
began
to
talk
he
was
very
intelligent
had
travelled
all
over
england
scotland
and
ireland
as
a
gentleman
servant
and
now
lived
alone
in
that
lonesome
place
he
said
he
was
tired
of
his
bargain
for
he
feared
he
should
lose
by
it
and
he
had
indeed
a
troublesome
office
for
without
number
were
passing
by
and
the
drivers
seemed
to
do
their
utmost
to
cheat
him
there
is
always
something
peculiar
in
the
house
of
a
man
living
alone
this
was
but
yet
nothing
seemed
wanting
for
comfort
though
a
female
who
had
travelled
half
as
far
would
have
needed
fifty
other
things
he
had
no
other
meat
or
drink
in
the
house
but
oat
bread
and
cheese
the
cheese
was
made
with
the
addition
of
seeds
and
some
skimmed
milk
he
gave
us
of
his
bread
and
cheese
and
milk
which
proved
to
be
sour
we
had
yet
ten
or
eleven
miles
to
travel
and
no
food
with
us
william
lay
under
the
wind
in
a
below
the
house
being
not
well
enough
to
partake
of
the
milk
and
bread
coleridge
gave
our
host
a
pamphlet
the
crisis
of
the
sugar
colonies
he
was
well
acquainted
with
burns
poems
there
was
a
politeness
and
a
manly
freedom
in
this
man
manners
which
pleased
me
very
much
he
told
us
that
he
had
served
a
gentleman
a
captain
in
the
army
he
did
not
know
who
he
was
for
none
of
his
relations
had
ever
come
to
see
him
but
he
used
to
receive
many
letters
that
he
had
lived
near
dumfries
till
they
would
let
him
stay
no
longer
he
made
such
havoc
with
the
game
his
whole
delight
from
morning
till
night
and
the
long
year
through
was
in
field
sports
he
would
be
on
his
feet
the
worst
days
in
winter
and
wade
through
snow
up
to
the
middle
after
his
game
if
he
had
company
he
was
in
tortures
till
they
were
gone
he
would
then
throw
off
his
coat
and
put
on
an
old
jacket
not
worth
he
drank
his
bottle
of
wine
every
day
and
two
if
he
had
better
sport
than
usual
ladies
sometimes
came
to
stay
with
his
wife
and
he
often
carried
them
out
in
an
irish
and
if
they
vexed
him
he
would
choose
the
dirtiest
roads
possible
and
spoil
their
clothes
by
jumping
in
and
out
of
the
car
and
treading
upon
them
but
for
all
that
and
so
he
ended
all
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
a
clever
fellow
and
he
liked
him
well
he
would
have
ten
or
a
dozen
hares
in
the
larder
at
once
he
half
maintained
his
family
with
game
and
he
himself
was
very
fond
of
eating
of
the
spoil
unusual
with
true
sportsmen
the
man
gave
us
an
account
of
his
farm
where
he
had
lived
which
was
so
cheap
and
pleasant
that
we
thought
we
should
have
liked
to
have
had
it
ourselves
soon
after
leaving
the
turnpike
house
we
turned
up
a
hill
to
the
right
the
road
for
a
little
way
very
steep
bare
hills
with
sheep
after
ascending
a
little
while
we
heard
the
murmur
of
a
stream
far
below
us
and
saw
it
flowing
downwards
on
our
left
towards
the
nith
and
before
us
between
steep
green
hills
coming
along
a
winding
valley
the
simplicity
of
the
prospect
impressed
us
very
much
there
was
a
single
cottage
by
the
brook
side
the
dell
was
not
heathy
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
think
of
peter
bell
highland
girl
we
now
felt
indeed
that
we
were
in
scotland
there
was
a
natural
peculiarity
in
this
place
in
the
scenes
of
the
nith
it
had
not
been
the
same
as
england
but
yet
not
simple
naked
scotland
the
road
led
us
down
the
hill
and
now
there
was
no
room
in
the
vale
but
for
the
river
and
the
road
we
had
sometimes
the
stream
to
the
right
sometimes
to
the
left
the
hills
were
pastoral
but
we
did
not
see
many
sheep
green
smooth
turf
on
the
left
no
ferns
on
the
right
the
grew
in
abundance
of
the
most
exquisite
colour
it
covered
a
whole
or
it
was
in
streams
and
patches
we
travelled
along
the
vale
without
appearing
to
ascend
for
some
miles
all
the
reaches
were
beautiful
in
exquisite
proportion
the
hills
seeming
very
high
from
being
so
near
to
us
it
might
have
seemed
a
valley
which
nature
had
kept
to
herself
for
pensive
thoughts
and
tender
feelings
but
that
we
were
reminded
at
every
turning
of
the
road
of
something
beyond
by
the
which
were
travelling
towards
us
though
these
carts
broke
in
upon
the
tranquillity
of
the
glen
they
added
much
to
the
picturesque
effect
of
the
different
views
which
indeed
wanted
nothing
though
perfectly
bare
houseless
and
treeless
after
some
time
our
road
took
us
upwards
towards
the
end
of
the
valley
now
the
steeps
were
heathy
all
around
just
as
we
began
to
climb
the
hill
we
saw
three
boys
who
came
down
the
cleft
of
a
brow
on
our
left
one
carried
a
and
the
hats
of
all
were
braided
with
honeysuckles
they
ran
after
one
another
as
wanton
as
the
wind
i
can
not
express
what
a
character
of
beauty
those
few
honeysuckles
in
the
hats
of
the
three
boys
gave
to
the
place
what
bower
could
they
have
come
from
we
walked
up
the
hill
met
two
travellers
the
woman
barefoot
our
little
lads
before
they
had
gone
far
were
joined
by
some
of
their
companions
all
without
shoes
and
stockings
they
told
us
they
lived
at
wanlockhead
the
village
above
pointing
to
the
top
of
the
hill
they
went
to
school
and
learned
latin
virgil
and
some
of
them
greek
homer
but
when
coleridge
began
to
inquire
further
off
they
ran
poor
things
i
suppose
afraid
of
being
examined
when
after
a
steep
ascent
we
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
we
saw
a
village
about
half
a
mile
before
us
on
the
side
of
another
hill
which
rose
up
above
the
spot
where
we
were
after
a
descent
a
sort
of
valley
or
hollow
nothing
grew
upon
this
ground
or
the
hills
above
or
below
but
heather
yet
round
about
the
village
which
consisted
of
a
great
number
of
huts
all
alike
and
all
thatched
with
a
few
larger
slated
houses
among
them
and
a
single
one
of
a
considerable
size
were
a
hundred
patches
of
cultivated
ground
potatoes
oats
hay
and
grass
we
were
struck
with
the
sight
of
haycocks
fastened
down
with
aprons
sheets
pieces
of
sacking
as
we
supposed
to
prevent
the
wind
from
blowing
them
away
we
afterwards
found
that
this
practice
was
very
general
in
scotland
every
cottage
seemed
to
have
its
little
plot
of
ground
fenced
by
a
ridge
of
earth
this
plot
contained
two
or
three
different
divisions
kail
potatoes
oats
hay
the
houses
all
standing
in
lines
or
never
far
apart
the
cultivated
ground
was
all
together
also
and
made
a
very
strange
appearance
with
its
many
greens
among
the
dark
brown
hills
neither
tree
nor
shrub
growing
yet
the
grass
and
the
potatoes
looked
greener
than
elsewhere
owing
to
the
bareness
of
the
neighbouring
hills
it
was
indeed
a
wild
and
singular
spot
to
use
a
woman
illustration
like
a
collection
of
patchwork
made
of
pieces
as
they
might
have
chanced
to
have
been
cut
by
the
only
just
smoothed
to
fit
each
other
the
different
sorts
of
produce
being
in
such
a
multitude
of
plots
and
those
so
small
and
of
such
irregular
shapes
add
to
the
strangeness
of
the
village
itself
that
we
had
been
climbing
upwards
though
gently
for
many
miles
and
for
the
last
mile
and
a
half
up
a
steep
ascent
and
did
not
know
of
any
village
till
we
saw
the
boys
who
had
come
out
to
play
the
air
was
very
cold
and
one
could
not
help
thinking
what
it
must
be
in
winter
when
those
hills
now
red
brown
should
have
their
three
months
covering
of
snow
the
village
as
we
guessed
is
inhabited
by
miners
the
mines
belong
to
the
duke
of
queensberry
the
road
to
the
village
down
which
the
lads
scampered
away
was
straight
forward
i
must
mention
that
we
met
just
after
we
had
parted
from
them
another
little
fellow
about
six
years
old
carrying
a
bundle
over
his
shoulder
he
seemed
poor
and
half
starved
and
was
scratching
his
fingers
which
were
covered
with
the
itch
he
was
a
miner
son
and
lived
at
wanlockhead
did
not
go
to
school
but
this
was
probably
on
account
of
his
youth
i
mention
him
because
he
seemed
to
be
a
proof
that
there
was
poverty
and
wretchedness
among
these
people
though
we
saw
no
other
symptom
of
it
and
afterwards
we
met
scores
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
same
village
our
road
turned
to
the
right
and
we
saw
at
the
distance
of
less
than
a
mile
a
tall
upright
building
of
grey
stone
with
several
men
standing
upon
the
roof
as
if
they
were
looking
out
over
battlements
it
stood
beyond
the
village
upon
higher
ground
as
if
presiding
over
it
a
kind
of
enchanter
castle
which
it
might
have
been
a
place
where
don
quixote
would
have
gloried
in
when
we
drew
nearer
we
saw
coming
out
of
the
side
of
the
building
a
large
machine
or
lever
in
appearance
like
a
great
as
we
supposed
for
raising
water
out
of
the
mines
it
heaved
upwards
once
in
half
a
minute
with
a
slow
motion
and
seemed
to
rest
to
take
breath
at
the
bottom
its
motion
being
accompanied
with
a
sound
between
a
groan
and
jike
there
would
have
been
something
in
this
object
very
striking
in
any
place
as
it
was
impossible
not
to
invest
the
machine
with
some
faculty
of
intellect
it
seemed
to
have
made
the
first
step
from
brute
matter
to
life
and
purpose
showing
its
progress
by
great
power
william
made
a
remark
to
this
effect
and
coleridge
observed
that
it
was
like
a
giant
with
one
idea
at
all
events
the
object
produced
a
striking
effect
in
that
place
where
everything
was
in
unison
with
it
particularly
the
building
itself
which
was
and
with
the
figures
upon
it
resembled
much
one
of
the
fortresses
in
the
wooden
cuts
of
bunyan
after
ascending
a
considerable
way
we
began
to
descend
again
and
now
we
met
a
team
of
horses
dragging
an
immense
tree
to
the
lead
mines
to
repair
or
add
to
the
building
and
presently
after
we
came
to
a
cart
with
another
large
tree
and
one
horse
left
in
it
right
in
the
middle
of
the
highway
we
were
a
little
out
of
humour
thinking
we
must
wait
till
the
team
came
back
there
were
men
and
boys
without
number
all
staring
at
us
after
a
little
consultation
they
set
their
shoulders
to
the
cart
and
with
a
good
heave
all
at
once
they
moved
it
and
we
passed
along
these
people
were
decently
dressed
and
their
manners
decent
there
was
no
hooting
or
impudent
laughter
leadhills
another
mining
village
was
the
place
of
our
destination
for
the
night
and
soon
after
we
had
passed
the
cart
we
came
in
sight
of
it
this
village
and
the
mines
belong
to
lord
hopetoun
it
has
more
stone
houses
than
wanlockhead
one
large
old
mansion
and
a
considerable
number
of
old
trees
beeches
i
believe
the
trees
told
of
the
coldness
of
the
climate
they
were
more
brown
than
green
far
browner
than
the
ripe
grass
of
the
little
here
as
at
wanlockhead
were
haycocks
and
in
every
possible
variety
of
shape
but
i
suppose
from
the
irregularity
of
the
ground
it
looked
far
less
artificial
indeed
i
should
think
that
a
painter
might
make
several
beautiful
pictures
in
this
village
it
straggles
down
both
sides
of
a
mountain
glen
as
i
have
said
there
is
a
large
mansion
there
is
also
a
stone
building
that
looks
like
a
school
and
the
houses
are
single
or
in
clusters
or
rows
as
it
may
chance
we
passed
a
inn
the
hopetoun
arms
but
the
house
of
otto
a
widow
had
been
recommended
to
us
with
high
encomiums
we
did
not
then
understand
scotch
inns
and
were
not
quite
satisfied
at
first
with
our
accommodations
but
all
things
were
smoothed
over
by
degrees
we
had
a
fire
lighted
in
our
dirty
parlour
tea
came
after
a
reasonable
waiting
and
the
fire
with
the
gentle
aid
of
twilight
burnished
up
the
room
into
cheerful
comfort
coleridge
was
weary
but
william
and
i
walked
out
after
tea
we
talked
with
one
of
the
miners
who
informed
us
that
the
building
which
we
had
supposed
to
be
a
school
was
a
library
belonging
to
the
village
he
said
they
had
got
a
book
into
it
a
few
weeks
ago
which
had
cost
thirty
pounds
and
that
they
had
all
sorts
of
books
what
have
you
shakespeare
yes
we
have
that
and
we
found
on
further
inquiry
that
they
had
a
large
library
of
long
standing
that
lord
hopetoun
had
subscribed
liberally
to
it
and
that
gentlemen
who
came
with
him
were
in
the
habit
of
making
larger
or
smaller
donations
each
man
who
had
the
benefit
of
it
paid
a
small
sum
monthly
i
think
about
fourpence
the
man
we
talked
with
spoke
much
of
the
comfort
and
quiet
in
which
they
lived
one
among
another
he
made
use
of
a
noticeable
expression
saying
that
they
were
very
peaceable
people
considering
they
lived
so
much
wages
were
about
thirty
pounds
a
year
they
had
land
for
potatoes
warm
houses
plenty
of
coals
and
only
six
hours
work
each
day
so
that
they
had
leisure
for
reading
if
they
chose
he
said
the
place
was
healthy
that
the
inhabitants
lived
to
a
great
age
and
indeed
we
saw
no
appearance
of
in
their
countenances
but
it
is
not
common
for
people
working
in
lead
mines
to
be
healthy
and
i
have
since
heard
that
it
is
a
healthy
place
however
this
may
be
they
are
unwilling
to
allow
it
for
the
landlady
the
next
morning
when
i
said
to
her
you
have
a
cold
climate
replied
ay
but
it
is
we
inquired
of
the
man
respecting
the
large
mansion
he
told
us
that
it
was
built
as
we
might
see
in
the
form
of
an
h
and
belonged
to
the
hopetouns
and
they
took
their
title
from
thence
and
that
part
of
it
was
used
as
a
chapel
we
went
close
to
it
and
were
a
good
deal
amused
with
the
building
itself
standing
forth
in
bold
contradiction
of
the
story
which
i
daresay
every
man
of
leadhills
tells
and
every
man
believes
that
it
is
in
the
shape
of
an
h
it
is
but
half
an
h
and
one
must
be
very
accommodating
to
allow
it
even
much
for
the
legs
are
far
too
short
footnote
there
is
some
mistake
here
the
hopetoun
title
was
not
taken
from
any
place
in
the
leadhills
much
less
from
the
house
shaped
like
an
we
visited
the
a
plot
of
land
not
very
small
crowded
with
graves
and
upright
the
village
and
the
dell
it
was
now
the
closing
in
of
evening
women
and
children
were
gathering
in
the
linen
for
the
night
which
was
bleaching
by
the
the
graves
overgrown
with
grass
such
as
by
industrious
culture
had
been
raised
up
about
the
houses
but
there
were
bunches
of
heather
here
and
there
and
with
the
that
grew
among
the
grass
the
small
plot
of
ground
had
a
beautiful
and
wild
appearance
william
left
me
and
i
went
to
a
shop
to
purchase
some
thread
the
woman
had
none
that
suited
me
but
she
would
send
a
lad
to
the
other
shop
in
the
meantime
i
sat
with
the
mother
and
was
much
pleased
with
her
manner
and
conversation
she
had
an
excellent
fire
and
her
cottage
though
very
small
looked
comfortable
and
cleanly
but
remember
i
saw
it
only
by
firelight
she
confirmed
what
the
man
had
told
us
of
the
quiet
manner
in
which
they
lived
and
indeed
her
house
and
fireside
seemed
to
need
nothing
to
make
it
a
cheerful
happy
spot
but
health
and
good
humour
there
was
a
bookishness
a
certain
formality
in
this
language
which
was
very
remarkable
she
had
a
dark
complexion
dark
eyes
and
wore
a
very
white
cap
much
over
her
face
which
gave
her
the
look
of
a
french
woman
and
indeed
afterwards
the
women
on
the
roads
frequently
reminded
us
of
french
women
partly
from
the
extremely
white
caps
of
the
elder
women
and
still
more
perhaps
from
a
certain
gaiety
and
appearance
in
their
dress
in
general
white
are
very
common
and
you
rarely
meet
a
young
girl
with
either
hat
or
cap
they
buckle
up
their
hair
often
in
a
graceful
manner
i
returned
to
the
inn
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
speak
with
the
landlady
she
had
made
a
hundred
hesitations
when
i
told
her
we
wanted
three
beds
at
last
she
confessed
she
three
beds
and
showed
me
into
a
parlour
which
looked
damp
and
cold
but
she
assured
me
in
a
tone
that
showed
she
was
unwilling
to
be
questioned
further
that
all
beds
were
well
aired
i
sat
a
while
by
the
kitchen
fire
with
the
landlady
and
began
to
talk
to
her
but
much
as
i
had
heard
in
her
praise
for
the
shopkeeper
had
told
me
she
was
a
varra
discreet
woman
i
can
not
say
that
her
manners
pleased
me
much
but
her
servant
made
amends
for
she
was
as
pleasant
and
cheerful
a
lass
as
was
ever
seen
and
when
we
asked
her
to
do
anything
she
answered
oh
yes
with
a
merry
smile
and
almost
ran
to
get
us
what
we
wanted
she
was
about
sixteen
years
old
wore
shoes
and
stockings
and
had
her
hair
tucked
up
with
a
comb
the
servant
at
brownhill
was
a
wench
barefoot
and
i
examined
the
kitchen
round
about
it
was
crowded
with
furniture
drawers
cupboards
pictures
pans
and
pots
arranged
without
order
except
that
the
plates
were
on
shelves
and
the
hung
in
rows
these
were
very
clean
but
floors
passages
staircase
everything
else
dirty
there
were
two
beds
in
recesses
in
the
wall
above
one
of
them
i
noticed
a
shelf
with
some
books
it
made
me
think
of
chaucer
clerke
of
oxenforde
liever
had
he
at
his
bed
head
twenty
books
clothed
in
black
and
red
they
were
baking
which
they
cut
into
quarters
and
over
the
fire
and
before
it
there
was
a
suspiciousness
about
otto
almost
like
she
was
very
jealous
of
any
inquiries
that
might
appear
to
be
made
with
the
faintest
idea
of
a
comparison
between
leadhills
and
any
other
place
except
the
advantage
was
evidently
on
the
side
of
leadhills
we
had
nice
honey
to
breakfast
when
ready
to
depart
we
learned
that
we
might
have
seen
the
library
which
we
had
not
thought
of
till
it
was
too
late
and
we
were
very
sorry
to
go
away
without
seeing
it
august
left
leadhills
at
nine
regretting
much
that
we
could
not
stay
another
day
that
we
might
have
made
more
minute
inquiries
respecting
the
manner
of
living
of
the
miners
and
been
able
to
form
an
estimate
from
our
own
observation
of
the
degree
of
knowledge
health
and
comfort
that
there
was
among
them
the
air
was
keen
and
cold
we
might
have
supposed
it
to
be
three
months
later
in
the
season
and
two
hours
earlier
in
the
day
the
landlady
had
not
lighted
us
a
fire
so
i
was
obliged
to
get
myself
toasted
in
the
kitchen
and
when
we
set
off
i
put
on
both
grey
cloak
and
spencer
our
road
carried
us
down
the
valley
and
we
soon
lost
sight
of
leadhills
for
the
valley
made
a
turn
almost
immediately
and
we
saw
two
miles
perhaps
before
us
the
glen
sloped
somewhat
rapidly
heathy
bare
no
hut
or
house
passed
by
a
shepherd
who
was
sitting
upon
the
ground
reading
with
the
book
on
his
knee
screened
from
the
wind
by
his
plaid
while
a
flock
of
sheep
were
feeding
near
him
among
the
rushes
and
coarse
grass
for
as
we
descended
we
came
among
lands
where
grass
grew
with
the
heather
travelled
through
several
reaches
of
the
glen
which
somewhat
resembled
the
valley
of
menock
on
the
other
side
of
wanlockhead
but
it
was
not
near
so
beautiful
the
forms
of
the
mountains
did
not
melt
so
exquisitely
into
each
other
and
there
was
a
coldness
and
if
i
may
so
speak
a
want
of
simplicity
in
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
heather
was
poor
not
covering
a
whole
not
in
luxuriant
streams
and
beds
interveined
with
rich
verdure
but
patchy
and
stunted
with
here
and
there
coarse
grass
and
rushes
but
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
a
spot
that
impressed
us
very
much
at
the
lower
end
of
this
new
reach
of
the
vale
was
a
decayed
tree
beside
a
decayed
cottage
the
vale
spreading
out
into
a
level
area
which
was
one
large
field
without
fence
and
without
division
of
a
dull
yellow
colour
the
vale
seemed
to
partake
of
the
desolation
of
the
cottage
and
to
participate
in
its
decay
and
yet
the
spot
was
in
its
nature
so
dreary
that
one
would
rather
have
wondered
how
it
ever
came
to
be
tenanted
by
man
than
lament
that
it
was
left
to
waste
and
solitude
yet
the
encircling
hills
were
so
exquisitely
formed
that
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
anything
more
lovely
than
this
place
would
have
been
if
the
valley
and
had
been
interspersed
with
trees
cottages
green
fields
and
hedgerows
but
all
was
desolate
the
one
large
field
which
filled
up
the
area
of
the
valley
appeared
as
i
have
said
in
decay
and
seemed
to
retain
the
memory
of
its
connexion
with
man
in
some
way
analogous
to
the
ruined
building
for
it
was
as
much
of
a
field
as
king
best
pasture
scattered
over
with
his
fattest
cattle
we
went
on
looking
before
us
the
place
losing
nothing
of
its
hold
upon
our
minds
when
we
discovered
a
woman
sitting
right
in
the
middle
of
the
field
alone
wrapped
up
in
a
grey
cloak
or
plaid
she
sat
motionless
all
the
time
we
looked
at
her
which
might
be
nearly
half
an
hour
we
could
not
conceive
why
she
sat
there
for
there
were
neither
sheep
nor
cattle
in
the
field
her
appearance
was
very
melancholy
in
the
meantime
our
road
carried
us
nearer
to
the
cottage
though
we
were
crossing
over
the
hill
to
the
left
leaving
the
valley
below
us
and
we
perceived
that
a
part
of
the
building
was
inhabited
and
that
what
we
had
supposed
to
be
blasted
tree
was
eight
trees
four
of
which
were
entirely
blasted
the
others
partly
so
and
round
about
the
place
was
a
little
potato
and
cabbage
garth
fenced
with
earth
no
doubt
that
woman
had
been
an
inhabitant
of
the
cottage
however
this
might
be
there
was
so
much
obscurity
and
uncertainty
about
her
and
her
figure
agreed
so
well
with
the
desolation
of
the
place
that
we
were
indebted
to
the
chance
of
her
being
there
for
some
of
the
most
interesting
feelings
that
we
had
ever
had
from
natural
objects
connected
with
man
in
dreary
solitariness
we
had
been
advised
to
go
along
the
road
which
would
have
carried
us
down
the
vale
but
we
met
some
travellers
who
recommended
us
to
climb
the
hill
and
go
by
the
village
of
crawfordjohn
as
being
much
nearer
we
had
a
long
hill
and
after
having
reached
the
top
steep
and
bad
roads
so
we
continued
to
walk
for
a
considerable
way
the
air
was
cold
and
clear
the
sky
blue
we
walked
cheerfully
along
in
the
sunshine
each
of
us
alone
only
william
had
the
charge
of
the
horse
and
car
so
he
sometimes
took
a
ride
which
did
but
poorly
recompense
him
for
the
trouble
of
driving
i
never
travelled
with
more
cheerful
spirits
than
this
day
our
road
was
along
the
side
of
a
high
moor
i
can
always
walk
over
a
moor
with
a
light
foot
i
seem
to
be
drawn
more
closely
to
nature
in
such
places
than
anywhere
else
or
rather
i
feel
more
strongly
the
power
of
nature
over
me
and
am
better
satisfied
with
myself
for
being
able
to
find
enjoyment
in
what
unfortunately
to
many
persons
is
either
dismal
or
insipid
this
moor
however
was
more
than
commonly
interesting
we
could
see
a
long
way
and
on
every
side
of
us
were
larger
or
smaller
tracts
of
cultivated
land
some
were
extensive
farms
yet
in
so
large
a
waste
they
did
but
look
small
with
barns
others
like
little
cottages
with
enough
to
feed
a
cow
and
supply
the
family
with
vegetables
in
looking
at
these
farms
we
had
always
one
feeling
why
did
the
plough
stop
there
why
might
not
they
as
well
have
carried
it
twice
as
far
there
were
no
hedgerows
near
the
farms
and
very
few
trees
as
we
were
passing
along
we
saw
an
old
man
the
first
we
had
seen
in
a
highland
bonnet
walking
with
a
staff
at
a
very
slow
pace
by
the
edge
of
one
of
the
moorland
he
wore
a
grey
plaid
and
a
dog
was
by
his
side
there
was
a
scriptural
solemnity
in
this
man
figure
a
sober
simplicity
which
was
most
impressive
scotland
is
the
country
above
all
others
that
i
have
seen
in
which
a
man
of
imagination
may
carve
out
his
own
pleasures
there
are
so
many
solitudes
and
the
employments
of
the
people
are
so
immediately
connected
with
the
places
where
you
find
them
and
their
dresses
so
simple
so
much
alike
yet
from
their
being
folding
garments
admitting
of
an
endless
variety
and
falling
often
so
gracefully
after
some
time
we
descended
towards
a
broad
vale
passed
one
sheltered
by
fir
trees
with
a
burn
close
to
it
children
playing
linen
bleaching
the
vale
was
open
pastures
and
unfenced
the
land
poor
the
village
of
crawfordjohn
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
a
long
way
before
us
to
the
left
asked
about
our
road
of
a
man
who
was
driving
a
cart
he
told
us
to
go
through
the
village
then
along
some
fields
and
we
should
come
to
a
herd
house
by
the
burn
side
the
highway
was
right
through
the
vale
unfenced
on
either
side
the
people
of
the
village
who
were
making
hay
all
stared
at
us
and
our
carriage
we
inquired
the
road
of
a
man
dressed
in
a
shabby
black
coat
at
work
in
one
of
the
hay
fields
he
looked
like
the
minister
of
the
place
and
when
he
spoke
we
felt
assured
that
he
was
so
for
he
was
not
sparing
of
hard
words
which
however
he
used
with
great
propriety
and
he
spoke
like
one
who
had
been
accustomed
to
dictate
our
car
wanted
mending
in
the
wheel
and
we
asked
him
if
there
was
a
blacksmith
in
the
village
yes
he
replied
but
when
we
showed
him
the
wheel
he
told
william
that
he
might
mend
it
himself
without
a
blacksmith
and
he
would
put
him
in
the
way
so
he
fetched
hammer
and
nails
and
gave
his
directions
which
william
obeyed
and
repaired
the
damage
entirely
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
the
priest
who
did
not
offer
to
lend
any
assistance
himself
not
as
if
he
would
not
have
been
willing
in
case
of
need
but
as
if
it
were
more
natural
for
him
to
dictate
and
because
he
thought
it
more
fit
that
william
should
do
it
himself
he
spoke
much
about
the
propriety
of
every
man
lending
all
the
assistance
in
his
power
to
travellers
and
with
some
ostentation
of
here
i
observed
a
honeysuckle
and
some
flowers
growing
in
a
garden
the
first
i
had
seen
in
scotland
it
is
a
pretty
village
but
must
be
very
cold
in
winter
it
stands
on
a
hillside
and
the
vale
itself
is
very
high
ground
unsheltered
by
trees
left
the
village
behind
us
and
our
road
led
through
arable
ground
for
a
considerable
way
on
which
were
growing
very
good
crops
of
corn
and
potatoes
our
friend
accompanied
us
to
show
us
the
way
and
coleridge
and
he
had
a
scientific
conversation
concerning
the
uses
and
properties
of
lime
and
other
manures
he
seemed
to
be
a
man
somewhat
pedantic
in
his
manners
but
this
might
be
only
the
difference
between
scotch
and
english
footnote
probably
the
rev
john
aird
minister
of
the
parish
j
soon
after
he
had
parted
from
us
we
came
upon
a
stony
rough
road
over
a
black
moor
and
presently
to
the
herd
house
by
the
burn
side
we
could
hardly
cross
the
burn
over
which
was
the
only
road
to
the
cottage
in
england
there
would
have
been
or
a
bridge
but
the
scotch
need
not
be
afraid
of
wetting
their
bare
feet
the
hut
had
its
little
fenced
with
earth
there
was
no
other
enclosure
but
the
common
heathy
with
coarse
grass
travelled
along
the
common
for
some
miles
before
we
joined
the
great
road
from
longtown
to
glasgow
saw
on
the
bare
at
a
distance
sometimes
a
solitary
farm
now
and
then
a
plantation
and
one
very
large
wood
with
an
appearance
of
richer
ground
above
but
it
was
so
very
high
we
could
not
think
it
possible
having
descended
considerably
the
common
was
no
longer
of
a
brown
heath
colour
but
grass
with
rushes
was
its
chief
produce
there
was
sometimes
a
solitary
hut
no
enclosures
except
the
and
sheep
pasturing
in
flocks
with
tending
them
i
remember
one
boy
in
particular
he
had
no
hat
on
and
only
had
a
grey
plaid
wrapped
about
him
it
is
nothing
to
describe
but
on
a
bare
moor
alone
with
his
sheep
standing
as
he
did
in
utter
quietness
and
silence
there
was
something
uncommonly
impressive
in
his
appearance
a
solemnity
which
recalled
to
our
minds
the
old
man
in
the
we
passed
many
people
who
were
mowing
or
raking
the
grass
of
the
common
it
was
little
better
than
rushes
but
they
did
not
mow
straight
forward
only
here
and
there
where
it
was
the
best
in
such
a
place
had
an
uncommon
appearance
to
us
after
a
long
descent
we
came
to
some
plantations
which
were
not
far
from
douglas
mill
the
country
for
some
time
had
been
growing
into
cultivation
and
now
it
was
a
wide
vale
with
large
tracts
of
corn
trees
in
clumps
no
hedgerows
which
always
make
a
country
look
bare
and
unlovely
for
my
part
i
was
better
pleased
with
the
desert
places
we
had
left
behind
though
no
doubt
the
inhabitants
of
this
place
think
it
a
varra
bonny
spot
for
the
scotch
are
always
pleased
with
their
own
abode
be
it
what
it
may
and
afterwards
at
edinburgh
when
we
were
talking
with
a
bookseller
of
our
travels
he
observed
that
it
was
a
fine
country
near
douglas
mill
douglas
mill
is
a
single
house
a
large
inn
being
one
of
the
regular
stages
between
longtown
and
glasgow
and
therefore
a
fair
specimen
of
the
best
of
the
country
inns
of
scotland
as
soon
as
our
car
stopped
at
the
door
we
felt
the
difference
at
an
english
inn
of
this
size
a
waiter
or
the
master
or
mistress
would
have
been
at
the
door
immediately
but
we
remained
some
time
before
anybody
came
then
a
barefooted
lass
made
her
appearance
but
she
only
looked
at
us
and
went
away
the
mistress
a
remarkably
handsome
woman
showed
us
into
a
large
parlour
we
ordered
and
i
finished
my
letter
to
mary
writing
on
the
same
on
which
william
had
written
to
me
two
years
before
after
dinner
william
and
i
sat
by
a
little
in
the
garden
we
had
left
leadhills
and
wanlockhead
far
above
us
and
now
were
come
into
a
warmer
climate
but
there
was
no
richness
in
the
face
of
the
country
the
shrubs
looked
cold
and
poor
and
yet
there
were
some
very
fine
trees
within
a
little
distance
of
douglas
mill
so
that
the
reason
perhaps
why
the
few
low
shrubs
and
trees
which
were
growing
in
the
gardens
seemed
to
be
so
unluxuriant
might
be
that
there
being
no
hedgerows
the
general
appearance
of
the
country
was
naked
and
i
could
not
help
seeing
the
same
coldness
where
perhaps
it
did
not
exist
in
itself
to
any
great
degree
for
the
corn
crops
are
abundant
and
i
should
think
the
soil
is
not
bad
while
we
were
sitting
at
the
door
two
of
the
landlady
children
came
out
the
elder
a
boy
about
six
years
old
was
running
away
from
his
little
brother
in
petticoats
the
ostler
called
out
sandy
tak
your
wee
brither
wi
you
another

the
window
sawny
dinna

your

the
mother
then
came
alexander
tak
your
wee
brother
by
the
hand
alexander
obeyed
and
the
two
went
off
in
peace
together
we
were
charged
eightpence
for
hay
at
this
inn
another
symptom
of
our
being
in
scotland
left
douglas
mill
at
about
three
travelled
through
an
open
corn
country
the
tracts
of
corn
large
and
unenclosed
we
often
passed
women
or
children
who
were
watching
a
single
cow
while
it
fed
upon
the
slips
of
grass
between
the
corn
william
asked
a
strong
woman
about
thirty
years
of
age
who
looked
like
the
mistress
of
a
family
i
suppose
moved
by
some
sentiment
of
compassion
for
her
being
so
employed
if
the
cow
would
eat
the
corn
if
it
were
left
to
itself
she
smiled
at
his
simplicity
it
is
indeed
a
melancholy
thing
to
see
a
woman
thus
waiting
as
it
were
body
and
soul
devoted
to
the
poor
beast
yet
even
this
is
better
than
working
in
a
manufactory
the
day
through
we
came
to
a
moorish
tract
saw
before
us
the
hills
of
loch
lomond
ben
lomond
and
another
distinct
each
by
itself
not
far
from
the
roadside
were
some
benches
placed
in
rows
in
the
middle
of
a
large
field
with
a
sort
of
covered
shed
like
a
but
much
more
like
those
boxes
which
the
italian
in
london
use
we
guessed
that
it
was
a
pulpit
or
tent
for
preaching
and
were
told
that
a
sect
met
there
occasionally
who
held
that
toleration
was
unscriptural
and
would
have
all
religions
but
their
own
exterminated
i
have
forgotten
what
name
the
man
gave
to
this
sect
we
could
not
learn
that
it
differed
in
any
other
respect
from
the
church
of
scotland
travelled
for
some
miles
along
the
open
country
which
was
all
without
hedgerows
sometimes
arable
sometimes
moorish
and
often
whole
tracts
covered
with
grunsel
there
was
one
field
which
one
might
have
believed
had
been
sown
with
grunsel
it
was
so
regularly
covered
with
it
a
large
square
field
upon
a
slope
its
boundary
marked
to
our
eyes
only
by
the
termination
of
the
bright
yellow
contiguous
to
it
were
other
fields
of
the
same
size
and
shape
one
of
clover
the
other
of
potatoes
all
equally
regular
crops
the
oddness
of
this
appearance
the
grunsel
being
uncommonly
luxuriant
and
the
field
as
yellow
as
gold
made
william
laugh
coleridge
was
melancholy
upon
it
observing
that
there
was
land
enough
wasted
to
rear
a
healthy
child
footnote

we
left
behind
us
considerably
to
the
right
a
single
high
mountain
i
have
forgotten

it
long
in

before
us
the

now
made
a

lanerk
in
sight
long
before

was
somewhat
disappointed
with
the
first
view
of

clyde

banks

swelling
and
varied

a
poverty
in

appearance

from

want

crossed
the

ascended
towards

stands
upon

we
were
within
about

mile
of

william
parted
from
coleridge

me
to
go
to
the
celebrated
waterfalls
coleridge
did
not
attempt
to
drive
the
horse
but
led
him
all
the
way
we
inquired
for
the
best
inn
and
were
told
that
the
new
inn
was
the
best
but
that
they
had
very
genteel
apartments
at
the
black
bull
and
made
less
charges
and
the
black
bull
was
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
so
we
thought
we
would
stop
there
as
the
horse
was
obstinate
and
weary
but
when
we
came
to
the
black
bull
we
had
no
wish
to
enter
the
apartments
for
it
seemed
the
abode
of
dirt
and
poverty
yet
it
was
a
large
building
the
town
showed
a
sort
of
french
face
and
would
have
done
much
more
had
it
not
been
for
the
true
british
tinge
of
the
doors
and
windows
dirty
the
shops
dull
the
women
too
seemed
to
be
very
dirty
in
their
dress
the
town
itself
is
not
ugly
the
houses
are
of
grey
stone
the
streets
not
very
narrow

the
decent

were
conducted
into

been
drinking
the
tables
were
unwiped

the
smell

offensive

the
evening
sun
was
now
sending
a
glorious
light
through
the

ran
from

the

were
of

were
almost
like

was
unwell

my

told
me
she
would
go
with
me
to
the
porter
lodge
where
i
might
be
admitted
i
was
grieved
to
hear
that
the

of

were
shut
up
in
a
gentleman
grounds
and
to
be
viewed
only
by
means
of
lock

much
however
as
the
pure
feeling
with
which
one
would
desire
to
visit
such
places
is
disturbed
by
useless
impertinent
or
even
unnecessary
interference
with
nature
yet
when
i
was
there
the
next
morning
i
seemed
to
feel
it
a
less
disagreeable
thing
than
in
smaller
and
more
delicate
spots
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
my
guide
a
sensible
little
girl
answered
my
inquiries
very
prettily
she
was
eight
years
old
read
in
the
collection
a
book
which
all
the
scotch
children
whom
i
have
questioned
read
in
i
found
it
was
a
collection
of
hymns
she
could
repeat
several
of
watts
we
passed
through
a
great
part
of
the
town
then
turned
down
a
steep
hill
and
came
in

of
a
long
range
of
cotton
mills
the
largest
and
loftiest
i
had
ever
seen
climbed
upwards

us
along

had
been
there

could
enter

by

the

i
did
not
venture
to
go
in

i
had
no
hope
of
meeting
william
i
had
a
delicious
walk
alone
through
the

the
sound
of
the
water
was
very
solemn
and
even
the
cotton
mills
in
the
fading
light
of
evening
had
somewhat
of
the
majesty
and
stillness
of
the
natural
objects
it
was
nearly
dark

after
he
had
left
us
he
had
taken
a
wrong
road
and
while
looking
about
to
set
himself
right
had
met
with
a
barefooted
boy
who
said
he
would
go
with
him
the
little
fellow
carried
him
by
a
wild
path
to
the
upper
of
the
falls
the
boniton
linn
and
coming
down
unexpectedly
upon
it
he
was
exceedingly
affected
by
the
solemn
grandeur
of
the
place
this
fall
is
not
much
admired
or
spoken
of
by
travellers
you
have
never
a
full
breast
view
of
it
it
does
not
make
a
complete
place
an
abode
of
its
own
as
a
perfect
waterfall
seems
to
me
to
do
but
the
river
down
which
you
look
through
a
long
vista
of
steep
and
rocks
the
roaring
of
the
waterfall
and
the
solemn
evening
lights
must
have
been
most
impressive
one
of
the
rocks
on
the
near
bank
even
in
broad
daylight
as
we
saw
it
the
next
morning
is
exactly
like
the
fractured
arch
of
an
abbey
with
the
lights
and
shadows
of
evening
upon
it
the
resemblance
must
have
been
much
more
striking
william
guide
was
a
pretty
boy
and
he
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
him
just
as
they
were
quitting
the
waterfall
william
mind
being
full
of
the
majesty
of
the
scene
the
little
fellow
pointed
to
the
top
of
a
rock
there
a
fine
there
ay
said
william
but
there
are
no
slaes
upon
it
which
was
true
enough
but
i
suppose
the
child
remembered
the
slaes
of
another
summer
though
as
he
said
he
was
but
half
seven
years
old
namely
six
and
a
half
he
conducted
william
to
the
other
fall
and
as
they
were
going
along
a
narrow
path
they
came
to
a
small
cavern
where
william
lost
him
and
looking
about
saw
his
pretty
figure
in
a
sort
of
natural
niche
fitted
for
a
statue
from
which
the
boy
jumped
out
laughing
delighted
with
the
success
of
his
trick
william
told
us
a
great
deal
about
him
while
he
sat
by
the
fire
and
of
the
pleasure
of
his
walk
often
repeating
i
wish
you
had
been
with
me
having
no
change
he
gave
the
boy
sixpence
which
was
certainly
if
he
had
formed
any
expectations
at
all
far
beyond
them
but
he
received
it
with
the
utmost
indifference
without
any
remark
of
surprise
or
pleasure
most
likely
he
did
not
know
how
many
halfpence
he
could
get
for
it
and
twopence
would
have
pleased
him
more
my
little
girl
was
delighted
with
the
sixpence
i
gave
her
and
said
she
would
buy
a
book
with
it
on
monday
morning
what
a
difference
between
the
manner
of
living
and
education
of
boys
and
of
girls
among
the
lower
classes
of
people
in
towns
she
had
never
seen
the
falls
of
the
clyde
nor
had
ever
been
further
than
the
porter
lodge
the
boy
i
daresay
knew
every
in
every
accessible
rock
as
well
as
the
fine
slae
bushes
and
the
nut
trees
august
the
morning
was
very
hot
a
morning
to
tempt
us
to
linger
by
the
i
wished
to
have
had
the
day
before
us
expecting
so
much
from
what
william
had
seen
but
when
we
went
there
i
did
not
desire
to
stay
longer
than
till
the
hour
which
we
had
prescribed
to
ourselves
for
it
was
a
rule
not
to
be
broken
in
upon
that
the
person
who
conducted
us
to
the
falls
was
to
remain
by
our
side
till
we
chose
to
depart
we
left
our
inn
immediately
after
breakfast
the
lanes
were
full
of
people
going
to
church
many
of
the
women
wore
long
scarlet
cardinals
and
were
without
hats
they
brought
to
my
mind
the
women
of
goslar
as
they
used
to
go
to
church
in
their
silver
or
gold
caps
with
their
long
cloaks
black
or
coloured
the
banks
of
the
clyde
from
lanerk
to
the
falls
rise
immediately
from
the
river
they
are
lofty
and
steep
and
covered
with
wood
the
road
to
the
falls
is
along
the
top
of
one
of
the
banks
and
to
the
left
you
have
a
prospect
of
the
open
country
corn
fields
and
scattered
houses
to
the
right
over
the
river
the
country
spreads
out
as
it
were
into
a
plain
covered
over
with
hills
no
one
hill
much
higher
than
another
but
hills
all
over
there
were
endless
pastures
overgrown
with
broom
and
scattered
trees
without
hedges
or
fences
of
any
kind
and
no
distinct
footpaths
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
lasses
in
gay
dresses
running
like
cattle
among
the
broom
making
their
way
straight
forward
towards
the
river
here
and
there
as
it
might
chance
they
waded
across
the
stream
and
when
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
opposite
bank
sat
down
by
the
about
half
a
mile
from
the
town
to
put
on
their
shoes
and
cotton
stockings
which
they
brought
tied
up
in
the
porter
lodge
is
about
a
mile
from
lanerk
and
the
lady
house
for
the
whole
belongs
to
a
lady
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
is
upon
a
hill
at
a
little
distance
we
walked
after
we
had
entered
the
private
grounds
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
along
a
gravel
then
came
to
a
little
side
gate
which
opened
upon
a
narrow
gravel
path
under
trees
and
in
a
minute
and
a
half
or
less
were
directly
opposite
to
the
great
waterfall
i
was
much
affected
by
the
first
view
of
it
the
majesty
and
strength
of
the
water
for
i
had
never
before
seen
so
large
a
cataract
struck
me
with
astonishment
which
died
away
giving
place
to
more
delightful
feelings
though
there
were
some
buildings
that
i
could
have
wished
had
not
been
there
though
at
first
unnoticed
the
chief
of
them
was
a
neat
white
house
very
near
to
the
waterfall
william
and
coleridge
however
were
in
a
better
and
perhaps
wiser
humour
and
did
not
dislike
the
house
indeed
it
was
a
very
place
with
a
garden
leaving
the
green
fields
free
and
open
this
house
is
on
the
side
of
the
river
opposite
to
the
grand
house
and
the
the
waterfall
cora
linn
is
composed
of
two
falls
with
a
sloping
space
which
to
be
about
twenty
yards
between
but
is
much
more
the
basin
which
receives
the
fall
is
enclosed
by
noble
rocks
with
trees
chiefly
hazels
birch
and
ash
growing
out
of
their
sides
whenever
there
is
any
hold
for
them
and
a
magnificent
it
is
for
such
a
river
i
think
more
grand
than
the
falls
themselves

after
having
stayed
some
time
we
returned
by
the
same
footpath
into
the
main
and
soon
came
upon
what
william
calls
an
gravel
walk
from
which
we
had
different
views
of
the
linn
we
sat
upon
a
bench
placed
for
the
sake
of
one
of
these
views
whence
we
looked
down
upon
the
waterfall
and
over
the
open
country
and
saw
a
ruined
tower
called
wallace
tower
which
stands
at
a
very
little
distance
from
the
fall
and
is
an
interesting
object
a
lady
and
gentleman
more
expeditious
tourists
than
ourselves
came
to
the
spot
they
left
us
at
the
seat
and
we
found
them
again
at
another
station
above
the
falls
coleridge
who
is
always
enough
to
enter
into
conversation
with
anybody
whom
he
meets
in
his
way
began
to
talk
with
the
gentleman
who
observed
that
it
was
a
waterfall
coleridge
was
delighted
with
the
accuracy
of
the
epithet
particularly
as
he
had
been
settling
in
his
own
mind
the
precise
meaning
of
the
words
grand
majestic
sublime
and
had
discussed
the
subject
with
william
at
some
length
the
day
before
yes
sir
says
coleridge
it
a
majestic
waterfall
sublime
and
beautiful
replied
his
friend
poor
coleridge
could
make
no
answer
and
not
very
desirous
to
continue
the
conversation
came
to
us
and
related
the
story
laughing
heartily
the
distance
from
one
linn
to
the
other
may
be
half
a
mile
or
more
along
the
same
walk
we
came
to
a
of
which
the
little
girl
had
the
key
she
said
it
was
called
the
because
it
was
lined
with
fog
namely
moss
on
the
outside
it
resembled
some
of
the
huts
in
the
prints
belonging
to
captain
cook
voyages
and
within
was
like
a
scooped
out
it
was
circular
with
a
roof
a
seat
all
round
fixed
to
the
wall
and
a
table
in
the
middle
seat
wall
roof
and
table
all
covered
with
moss
in
the
neatest
manner
possible
it
was
as
snug
as
a
bird
nest
i
wish
we
had
such
a
one
at
the
top
of
our
orchard
only
a
great
deal
smaller
we
afterwards
found
that
huts
of
the
same
kind
were
common
in
the
of
scotland
but
we
never
saw
any
that
were
so
beautifully
wrought
as
this
it
had
however
little
else
to
recommend
it
the
situation
being
chosen
without
judgment
there
was
no
prospect
from
it
nor
was
it
a
place
of
seclusion
and
retirement
for
it
stood
close
to
the
gravel
walk
we
wished
we
could
have
shoved
it
about
a
hundred
yards
further
on
when
we
arrived
at
a
bench
which
was
also
close
to
the
walk
for
just
below
the
bench
the
walk
elbowing
out
into
a
circle
there
was
a
beautiful
spring
of
clear
water
which
we
could
see
rise
up
continually
at
the
bottom
of
a
round
stone
basin
full
to
the
brim
the
water
gushing
out
at
a
little
outlet
and
passing
away
under
the
walk
a
reason
was
wanted
for
placing
the
hut
where
it
is
what
a
good
one
would
this
little
spring
have
furnished
for
bringing
it
hither
along
the
whole
of
the
path
were
openings
at
intervals
for
views
of
the
river
but
as
almost
always
happens
in
gentlemen
grounds
they
were
injudiciously
managed
you
were
prepared
for
a
dead
stand
by
a
parapet
a
painted
seat
or
some
other
device
we
stayed
some
time
at
the
boniton
fall
which
has
one
great
advantage
over
the
other
falls
that
it
is
at
the
termination
of
the
and
we
see
no
traces
of
the
yet
except
under
some
accidental
circumstances
such
as
a
sunset
like
that
of
the
preceding
evening
it
is
greatly
inferior
to
the
cora
linn
we
returned
to
the
inn
to
dinner
the
landlord
set
the
first
dish
upon
the
table
as
is
common
in
england
and
we
were
well
waited
upon
this
first
dish
was
true
scottish
a
boiled
sheep
head
with
the
hair
singed
off
coleridge
and
i
ate
heartily
of
it
we
had
barley
broth
in
which
the
sheep
head
had
been
boiled
a
party
of
tourists
whom
we
had
met
in
the
drove
from
the
door
while
we
were
waiting
for
dinner
i
guess
they
were
fresh
from
england
for
they
had
stuffed
the
pockets
of
their
carriage
with
bundles
of
heather
roots
and
all
just
as
if
scotland
grew
no
heather
but
on
the
banks
of
the
clyde
they
passed
away
with
their
treasure
towards
loch
lomond
a
party
of
boys
dressed
all
alike
in
blue
very
neat
were
standing
at
the
we
conjectured
they
were
charity
scholars
but
found
on
inquiry
that
they
were
apprentices
to
the
cotton
factory
we
were
told
that
they
were
well
instructed
in
reading
and
writing
we
had
seen
in
the
morning
a
flock
of
girls
dressed
in
grey
coming
out
of
the
factory
probably
apprentices
also
after
dinner
set
off
towards
hamilton
but
on
foot
for
we
had
to
turn
aside
to
the
cartland
rocks
and
our
car
was
to
meet
us
on
the
road
a
guide
attended
us
who
might
almost
in
size
and
certainly
in
activity
have
been
compared
with
william
companion
who
hid
himself
in
the
niche
of
the
cavern
his
method
of
walking
and
very
quick
step
soon
excited
our
attention
i
could
hardly
keep
up
with
him
he
paddled
by
our
side
just
reaching
to
my
shoulder
like
a
little
dog
with
his
long
snout
pushed
before
him
for
he
had
an
enormous
nose
and
walked
with
his
head
foremost
i
said
to
him
how
quick
you
walk
he
replied
was
quick
walking
and
when
i
asked
him
what
he
called
so
he
said
five
miles
an
hour
and
then
related
in
how
many
hours
he
had
lately
walked
from
lanerk
to
edinburgh
done
some
errands
and
returned
to
lanerk
i
have
forgotten
the
particulars
but
it
was
a
very
short
time
and
added
that
he
had
an
old
father
who
could
walk
at
the
rate
of
four
miles
an
hour
for
miles
any
day
and
had
never
had
an
hour
sickness
in
his
life
then
said
i
he
has
not
drunk
much
strong
liquor
yes
enough
to
drown
him
from
his
eager
manner
of
uttering
this
i
inferred
that
he
himself
was
a
drinker
and
the
man
who
met
us
with
the
car
told
william
that
he
gained
a
great
deal
of
money
as
an
but
spent
it
all
in
tippling
he
had
been
a
but
could
not
bear
the
confinement
on
account
of
a
weakness
in
his
chest
the
neighbourhood
of
lanerk
is
exceedingly
pleasant
we
came
to
a
sort
of
district
of
glens
or
little
valleys
that
cleave
the
hills
leaving
a
cheerful
open
country
above
them
with
no
superior
hills
but
an
undulating
surface
our
guide
pointed
to
the
situation
of
the
cartland
crags
we
were
to
cross
a
narrow
valley
and
walk
down
on
the
other
side
and
then
we
should
be
at
the
spot
but
the
little
fellow
made
a
sharp
turn
down
a
footpath
to
the
left
saying
we
must
have
some
conversation
here
he
paddled
on
with
his
small
pawing
feet
till
we
came
right
opposite
to
a
gentleman
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
when
he
halted
repeating
some
words
i
have
forgotten
what
which
were
taken
up
by
the
most
distinct
echo
i
ever
heard
this
is
saying
little
it
was
the
most
distinct
echo
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
it
shouted
the
names
of
our
fireside
friends
in
the
very
tone
in
which
william
and
coleridge
spoke
but
it
seemed
to
make
a
joke
of
me
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
my
own
voice
it
was
so
shrill
and
pert
exactly
as
if
some
one
had
been
mimicking
it
very
successfully
with
an
intention
of
making
me
ridiculous
i
wished
joanna
had
been
there
to
laugh
for
the
echo
is
an
excellent
laugher
and
would
have
almost
made
her
believe
that
it
was
a
true
story
which
william
has
told
of
her
and
the
mountains
we
turned
back
crossed
the
valley
went
through
the
orchard
and
plantations
belonging
to
the
gentleman
house
by
the
bye
we
observed
to
our
guide
that
the
echo
must
bring
many
troublesome
visitors
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
owner
of
that
house
oh
no
said
he
he
glories
in
much
company
he
was
a
native
of
that
neighbourhood
had
made
a
moderate
fortune
abroad
purchased
an
estate
built
the
house
and
raised
the
plantations
and
further
had
made
a
convenient
walk
through
his
woods
to
the
cartland
crags
the
house
was
modest
and
neat
and
though
not
adorned
in
the
best
taste
and
though
the
plantations
were
of
fir
we
looked
at
it
with
great
pleasure
there
was
such
true
liberality
and
in
leaving
his
orchard
path
open
and
his
walks
unobstructed
by
gates
i
hope
this
goodness
is
not
often
abused
by
plunderers
of
the
which
were
hung
with
tempting
apples
close
to
the
path
at
the
termination
of
the
little
valley
we
descended
through
a
wood
along
a
very
steep
path
to
a
muddy
stream
running
over
limestone
rocks
turned
up
to
the
left
along
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
soon
we
were
closed
in
by
rocks
on
each
side
they
were
very
lofty
of
limestone
trees
starting
out
of
them
high
and
low
overhanging
the
stream
or
shooting
up
towards
the
sky
no
place
of
the
kind
could
be
more
beautiful
if
the
stream
had
been
clear
but
it
was
of
a
muddy
yellow
colour
had
it
been
a
large
river
one
might
have
got
the
better
of
the
unpleasantness
of
the
muddy
water
in
the
grandeur
of
its
roaring
the
boiling
up
of
the
foam
over
the
rocks
or
the
obscurity
of
its
pools
we
had
been
told
that
the
cartland
crags
were
better
worth
going
to
see
than
the
falls
of
the
clyde
i
did
not
think
so
but
i
have
seen
rocky
dells
resembling
this
before
with
clear
water
instead
of
that
muddy
stream
and
never
saw
anything
like
the
falls
of
the
clyde
it
would
be
a
delicious
spot
to
have
near
one
house
one
would
linger
out
many
a
day
in
the
cool
shade
of
the
caverns
and
the
stream
would
soothe
one
by
its
murmuring
still
being
an
old
friend
one
would
not
love
it
the
less
for
its
homely
face
even
we
as
we
passed
along
could
not
help
stopping
for
a
long
while
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
lazy
foam
for
ever
in
motion
and
never
moved
away
in
a
still
place
of
the
water
covering
the
whole
surface
of
it
with
streaks
and
lines
and
circles
wild
marjoram
grew
upon
the
rocks
in
great
perfection
and
beauty
our
guide
gave
me
a
bunch
and
said
he
should
come
hither
to
collect
a
store
for
tea
for
the
winter
and
that
it
was
varra
halesome
he
drank
none
else
we
walked
perhaps
half
a
mile
along
the
bed
of
the
river
but
it
might
to
be
much
further
than
it
was
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
the
path
and
the
sharp
and
many
turnings
of
the
glen
passed
two
of
wallace
caves
there
is
scarce
a
noted
glen
in
scotland
that
has
not
a
cave
for
wallace
or
some
other
hero
before
we
left
the
river
the
rocks
became
less
lofty
turned
into
a
wood
through
which
was
a
convenient
path
upwards
met
the
owner
of
the
house
and
the
and
thanked
him
for
the
pleasure
which
he
had
provided
for
us
and
other
travellers
by
making
such
pretty
pathways
it
was
four
when
we
reached
the
place
where
the
car
was
waiting
we
were
anxious
to
be
off
as
we
had
fifteen
miles
to
go
but
just
as
we
were
seating
ourselves
we
found
that
the
cushions
were
missing
william
was
forced
to
go
back
to
the
town
a
mile
at
least
and
coleridge
and
i
waited
with
the
car
it
rained
and
we
had
some
fear
that
the
evening
would
be
wet
but
the
rain
soon
ceased
though
the
sky
continued
gloomy
an
unfortunate
circumstance
for
we
had
to
travel
through
a
beautiful
country
and
of
that
sort
which
is
most
set
off
by
sunshine
and
pleasant
weather
travelled
through
the
vale
or
of
the
clyde
as
it
is
called
for
ten
or
eleven
miles
having
the
river
on
our
right
we
had
fine
views
both
up
and
down
the
river
for
the
first
three
or
four
miles
our
road
being
not
close
to
it
but
above
its
banks
along
the
open
country
which
was
here
occasionally
intersected
by
hedgerows
left
our
car
in
the
road
and
turned
down
a
field
to
the
fall
of
stonebyres
another
of
the
falls
of
the
clyde
which
i
had
not
heard
spoken
of
therefore
it
gave
me
the
more
pleasure
we
saw
it
from
the
top
of
the
bank
of
the
river
at
a
little
distance
it
has
not
the
imposing
majesty
of
cora
linn
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
left
to
itself
a
grand
solitude
in
the
heart
of
a
populous
country
we
had
a
prospect
above
and
below
it
of
cultivated
grounds
with
houses
hills
but
the
river
banks
were
lonesome
steep
and
woody
with
rocks
near
the
fall
a
little
further
on
came
more
into
company
with
the
river
sometimes
we
were
close
to
it
sometimes
above
it
but
always
at
no
great
distance
and
now
the
vale
became
more
interesting
and
amusing
it
is
very
populous
with
villages
hamlets
single
cottages
or
embosomed
in
orchards
and
scattered
over
with
gentlemen
houses
some
of
them
very
ugly
tall
and
obtrusive
others
neat
and
comfortable
we
seemed
now
to
have
got
into
a
country
where
poverty
and
riches
were
shaking
hands
together
pears
and
apples
of
which
the
crop
was
abundant
hung
over
the
road
often
growing
in
orchards
unfenced
or
there
might
be
bunches
of
broom
along
the
in
an
interrupted
line
that
looked
like
a
hedge
till
we
came
to
it
and
saw
the
gaps
bordering
on
these
fruitful
orchards
perhaps
would
be
a
patch
its
chief
produce
being
gorse
or
broom
there
was
nothing
like
a
moor
or
common
anywhere
but
small
plots
of
uncultivated
ground
were
left
high
and
low
among
the
potatoes
corn
cabbages
which
grew
intermingled
now
among
trees
now
bare
the
trough
of
the
clyde
is
indeed
a
singular
and
very
interesting
region
it
is
somewhat
like
the
upper
part
of
the
vale
of
nith
but
above
the
nith
is
much
less
cultivated
ground
without
hedgerows
or
orchards
or
anything
that
looks
like
a
rich
country
we
met
crowds
of
people
coming
from
the
kirk
the
lasses
were
gaily
dressed
often
in
white
gowns
coloured
satin
bonnets
and
coloured
silk
handkerchiefs
and
generally
with
their
shoes
and
stockings
in
a
bundle
hung
on
their
arm
before
we
left
the
river
the
vale
became
much
less
interesting
resembling
a
poor
english
country
the
fields
being
large
and
unluxuriant
hedges
it
had
been
dark
long
before
we
reached
hamilton
and
william
had
some
difficulty
in
driving
the
tired
horse
through
the
town
at
the
inn
they
hesitated
about
being
able
to
give
us
beds
the
house
being
lights
at
every
window
we
were
rather
alarmed
for
our
accommodations
during
the
rest
of
the
tour
supposing
the
house
to
be
filled
with
but
they
were
in
general
only
regular
travellers
for
out
of
the
main
road
from
town
to
town
we
saw
scarcely
a
carriage
and
the
inns
were
empty
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
treatment
we
met
with
at
this
inn
except
the
lazy
impertinence
of
the
waiter
it
was
a
townish
place
with
a
great
larder
set
out
the
house
throughout
dirty
august
immediately
after
breakfast
walked
to
the
duke
of
hamilton
house
to
view
the
chiefly
the
famous
picture
of
daniel
in
the
lions
den
by
rubens
it
is
a
large
building
without
grandeur
a
heavy
lumpish
mass
after
the
fashion
of
the
hopetoun
h
only
five
times
the
size
and
with
longer
legs
which
makes
it
gloomy
we
entered
the
gate
passed
the
porter
lodge
where
we
saw
nobody
and
stopped
at
the
front
door
as
william
had
done
two
years
before
with
sir
william
rush
family
we
were
met
by
a
little
man
shabbily
dressed
out
of
livery
who
we
found
was
the
porter
after
scanning
us
over
he
told
us
that
we
ought
not
to
have
come
to
that
door
we
said
we
were
sorry
for
the
mistake
but
as
one
of
our
party
had
been
there
two
years
before
and
was
admitted
by
the
same
entrance
we
had
supposed
it
was
the
regular
way
after
many
hesitations
and
having
kept
us
five
minutes
waiting
in
the
large
hall
while
he
went
to
consult
with
the
housekeeper
he
informed
us
that
we
could
not
be
admitted
at
that
time
the
housekeeper
being
unwell
but
that
we
might
return
in
an
hour
he
then
conducted
us
through
long
gloomy
passages
to
an
obscure
door
at
the
corner
of
the
house
we
asked
if
we
might
be
permitted
to
walk
in
the
park
in
the
meantime
and
he
told
us
that
this
would
not
be
agreeable
to
the
duke
family
we
returned
to
the
inn
discontented
enough
but
resolved
not
to
waste
an
hour
if
there
were
anything
else
in
the
neighbourhood
worth
seeing
the
waiter
told
us
there
was
a
curious
place
called
baroncleugh
with
gardens
cut
out
in
rocks
and
we
determined
to
go
thither
we
had
to
walk
through
the
town
which
may
be
about
as
large
as
penrith
and
perhaps
a
mile
further
along
a
dusty
turnpike
road
the
morning
was
hot
sunny
and
windy
and
we
were
half
tired
before
we
reached
the
place
but
were
amply
repaid
for
our
trouble
footnote
the
house
belonging
to
the
earls
of
hopetoun
at
leadhills
not
that
which
bears
this
name
about
twelve
miles
from
j
the
general
face
of
the
country
near
hamilton
is
much
in
the
ordinary
english
style
not
very
hilly
with
hedgerows
corn
fields
and
stone
houses
the
clyde
is
here
an
open
river
with
low
banks
and
the
country
spreads
out
so
wide
that
there
is
no
appearance
of
a
regular
vale
baroncleugh
is
in
a
beautiful
deep
glen
through
which
runs
the
river
avon
a
stream
that
falls
into
the
clyde
the
house
stands
very
sweetly
in
complete
retirement
it
has
its
gardens
and
terraces
one
above
another
with
flights
of
steps
between
and
cut
in
fantastic
shapes
and
and
still
below
apples
and
pears
were
hanging
in
abundance
on
the
branches
of
large
old
trees
which
grew
intermingled
with
the
natural
wood
elms
beeches
even
to
the
water
edge
the
whole
place
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
taste
of
our
ancestors
and
the
yews
and
hollies
are
shaven
as
nicely
and
the
gravel
walks
and
kept
in
as
exact
order
as
if
the
spirit
of
the
first
architect
of
the
terraces
still
presided
over
them
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
is
left
in
its
natural
wildness
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
higher
up
but
the
deep
dell
its
steep
banks
being
covered
with
fine
trees
a
beautiful
relief
or
contrast
to
the
garden
which
is
one
of
the
most
elaborate
old
things
ever
seen
a
little
hanging
garden
of
babylon
i
was
sorry
to
hear
that
the
owner
of
this
sweet
place
did
not
live
there
always
he
had
built
a
small
thatched
house
to
eke
out
the
old
one
it
was
a
neat
dwelling
with
no
false
ornaments
we
were
exceedingly
sorry
to
quit
this
spot
which
is
left
to
nature
and
past
times
and
should
have
liked
to
have
pursued
the
glen
further
up
we
were
told
that
there
was
a
ruined
castle
and
the
walk
itself
must
be
very
delightful
but
we
wished
to
reach
glasgow
in
good
time
and
had
to
go
again
to
hamilton
house
returned
to
the
town
by
a
much
shorter
road
and
were
very
angry
with
the
waiter
for
not
having
directed
us
to
it
but
he
was
too
great
a
man
to
speak
three
words
more
than
he
could
help
we
stopped
at
the
proper
door
of
the
duke
house
and
seated
ourselves
humbly
upon
a
bench
waiting
the
pleasure
of
the
porter
who
after
a
little
time
informed
us
that
we
could
not
be
admitted
giving
no
reason
whatever
when
we
got
to
the
inn
we
could
just
gather
from
the
waiter
that
it
was
not
usual
to
refuse
admittance
to
strangers
but
that
was
all
he
could
not
or
would
not
help
us
so
we
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
which
mortified
us
for
i
had
wished
much
to
see
the
picture
william
vowed
that
he
would
write
that
very
night
to
lord
archibald
hamilton
stating
the
whole
matter
which
he
did
from
glasgow
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
the
park
though
as
we
were
not
allowed
to
walk
there
we
saw
but
little
of
it
it
looked
pleasant
as
all
parks
with
fine
trees
must
be
but
as
it
seemed
to
be
only
a
large
nearly
level
plain
it
could
not
be
a
particularly
beautiful
park
though
it
borders
upon
the
clyde
and
the
avon
runs
i
believe
through
it
after
leaving
the
solitude
of
the
glen
of
baroncleugh
quitted
hamilton
at
about
eleven
there
is
nothing
interesting
between
hamilton
and
glasgow
till
we
came
to
bothwell
castle
a
few
miles
from
hamilton
the
country
is
cultivated
but
not
rich
the
fields
large
a
perfect
contrast
to
the
huddling
together
of
hills
and
trees
corn
and
pasture
grounds
cottages
orchards
broom
and
gorse
but
chiefly
broom
that
had
amused
us
so
much
the
evening
before
in
passing
through
the
trough
of
the
clyde
a
native
of
scotland
would
not
probably
be
satisfied
with
the
account
i
have
given
of
the
trough
of
the
clyde
for
it
is
one
of
the
most
celebrated
scenes
in
scotland
we
certainly
received
less
pleasure
from
it
than
we
had
expected
but
it
was
plain
that
this
was
chiefly
owing
to
the
unfavourable
circumstances
under
which
we
saw
it
a
gloomy
sky
and
a
cold
blighting
wind
it
is
a
very
beautiful
district
yet
there
as
in
all
the
other
scenes
of
scotland
celebrated
for
their
fertility
we
found
something
which
gave
us
a
notion
of
barrenness
of
what
was
not
altogether
genial
the
new
fir
and
larch
plantations
here
as
in
almost
every
other
part
of
scotland
contributed
not
a
little
to
this
effect
crossed
the
clyde
not
far
from
hamilton
and
had
the
river
for
some
miles
at
a
distance
from
us
on
our
left
but
after
having
gone
it
might
be
three
miles
we
came
to
a
porter
lodge
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
where
we
were
to
turn
to
bothwell
castle
which
is
in
lord
douglas
grounds
the
woman
who
keeps
the
gate
brought
us
a
book
in
which
we
wrote
down
our
names
went
about
half
a
mile
before
we
came
to
the
came
to
a
large
range
of
stables
where
we
were
to
leave
the
car
but
there
was
no
one
to
unyoke
the
horse
so
william
was
obliged
to
do
it
himself
a
task
which
he
performed
very
awkwardly
being
then
new
to
it
we
saw
the
ruined
castle
embosomed
in
trees
passed
the
house
and
soon
found
ourselves
on
the
edge
of
a
steep
brow
immediately
above
and
overlooking
the
course
of
the
river
clyde
through
a
deep
hollow
between
woods
and
green
steeps
we
had
approached
at
right
angles
from
the
main
road
to
the
place
over
a
flat
and
had
seen
nothing
before
us
but
a
nearly
level
country
terminated
by
distant
slopes
the
clyde
hiding
himself
in
his
deep
bed
it
was
exceedingly
delightful
to
come
thus
unexpectedly
upon
such
a
beautiful
region
the
castle
stands
nobly
overlooking
the
clyde
when
we
came
up
to
it
i
was
hurt
to
see
that
had
taken
place
of
the
natural
overgrowings
of
the
ruin
the
scattered
stones
and
wild
plants
it
is
a
large
and
grand
pile
of
red
freestone
harmonizing
perfectly
with
the
rocks
of
the
river
from
which
no
doubt
it
has
been
hewn
when
i
was
a
little
accustomed
to
the
unnaturalness
of
a
modern
garden
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
excessive
beauty
and
luxuriance
of
some
of
the
plants
particularly
the
clematis
and
a
creeping
plant
without
flowers
which
scrambled
up
the
castle
wall
along
with
the
ivy
and
spread
its
branches
so
lavishly
that
it
seemed
to
be
in
its
natural
situation
and
one
could
not
help
thinking
that
though
not
among
the
ruins
of
this
country
it
must
somewhere
have
its
natural
abode
in
such
places
if
bothwell
castle
had
not
been
close
to
the
douglas
mansion
we
should
have
been
disgusted
with
the
possessor
miserable
conception
of
adorning
such
a
venerable
ruin
but
it
is
so
very
near
to
the
house
that
of
necessity
the
must
have
extended
beyond
it
and
perhaps
the
neatness
of
a
shaven
lawn
and
the
complete
desolation
natural
to
a
ruin
might
have
made
an
unpleasing
contrast
and
besides
being
within
the
precincts
of
the
and
so
very
near
to
the
modern
mansion
of
a
noble
family
it
has
forfeited
in
some
degree
its
independent
majesty
and
becomes
a
tributary
to
the
mansion
its
solitude
being
interrupted
it
has
no
longer
the
same
command
over
the
mind
in
sending
it
back
into
past
times
or
excluding
the
ordinary
feelings
which
we
bear
about
us
in
daily
life
we
had
then
only
to
regret
that
the
castle
and
house
were
so
near
to
each
other
and
it
was
impossible
to
regret
it
for
the
ruin
presides
in
state
over
the
river
far
from
city
or
town
as
if
it
might
have
had
a
peculiar
privilege
to
preserve
its
memorials
of
past
ages
and
maintain
its
own
character
and
independence
for
centuries
to
come
we
sat
upon
a
bench
under
the
high
trees
and
had
beautiful
views
of
the
different
reaches
of
the
river
above
and
below
on
the
opposite
bank
which
is
finely
wooded
with
elms
and
other
trees
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
priory
built
upon
a
rock
and
rock
and
ruin
are
so
blended
together
that
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
one
from
the
other
nothing
can
be
more
beautiful
than
the
little
remnants
of
this
holy
place
elm
trees
for
we
were
near
enough
to
distinguish
them
by
their
branches
grow
out
of
the
walls
and
overshadow
a
small
but
very
elegant
window
it
can
scarcely
be
conceived
what
a
grace
the
castle
and
priory
impart
to
each
other
and
the
river
clyde
flows
on
smooth
and
unruffled
below
seeming
to
my
thoughts
more
in
harmony
with
the
sober
and
stately
images
of
former
times
than
if
it
had
roared
over
a
rocky
channel
forcing
its
sound
upon
the
ear
it
blended
gently
with
the
warbling
of
the
smaller
birds
and
chattering
of
the
larger
ones
that
had
made
their
nests
in
the
ruins
in
this
fortress
the
chief
of
the
english
nobility
were
confined
after
the
battle
of
bannockburn
if
a
man
is
to
be
a
prisoner
he
scarcely
could
have
a
more
pleasant
place
to
solace
his
captivity
but
i
thought
that
for
close
confinement
i
should
prefer
the
banks
of
a
lake
or
the
the
greatest
charm
of
a
brook
or
river
is
in
the
liberty
to
pursue
it
through
its
windings
you
can
then
take
it
in
whatever
mood
you
like
silent
or
noisy
sportive
or
quiet
the
beauties
of
a
brook
or
river
must
be
sought
and
the
pleasure
is
in
going
in
search
of
them
those
of
a
lake
or
of
the
sea
come
to
you
of
themselves
these
rude
warriors
cared
little
perhaps
about
either
and
yet
if
one
may
judge
from
the
writings
of
chaucer
and
from
the
old
romances
more
interesting
passions
were
connected
with
natural
objects
in
the
days
of
chivalry
than
now
though
going
in
search
of
scenery
as
it
is
called
had
not
then
been
thought
of
i
had
heard
nothing
of
bothwell
castle
at
least
nothing
that
i
remembered
therefore
perhaps
my
pleasure
was
greater
compared
with
what
i
received
elsewhere
than
others
might
feel
at
our
return
to
the
stables
we
found
an
inferior
groom
who
helped
william
to
yoke
the
horse
and
was
very
civil
we
grew
hungry
before
we
had
travelled
many
miles
and
seeing
a
large
it
was
in
a
walled
court
some
yards
from
the
road
coleridge
got
off
the
car
to
inquire
if
we
could
dine
there
and
was
told
we
could
have
nothing
but
eggs
it
was
a
miserable
place
very
like
a
french
house
indeed
we
observed
in
almost
every
part
of
scotland
except
edinburgh
that
we
were
reminded
ten
times
of
france
and
germany
for
once
of
england
saw
nothing
remarkable
after
leaving
bothwell
except
the
first
view
of
glasgow
at
some
miles
distance
terminated
by
the
mountains
of
loch
lomond
the
suburbs
of
glasgow
extend
very
far
houses
on
each
side
of
the
highway
all
ugly
and
the
inhabitants
dirty
the
roads
are
very
wide
and
everything
seems
to
tell
of
the
neighbourhood
of
a
large
town
we
were
annoyed
by
carts
and
dirt
and
the
road
was
full
of
people
who
all
noticed
our
car
in
one
way
or
other
the
children
often
sent
a
hooting
after
us
wearied
completely
we
at
last
reached
the
town
and
were
glad
to
walk
leading
the
car
to
the
first
decent
inn
which
was
luckily
not
far
from
the
end
of
the
town
william
who
gained
most
of
his
from
ostlers
had
been
informed
of
this
house
by
the
ostler
at
hamilton
it
proved
quiet
and
tolerably
cheap
a
new
building
the
saracen
head
i
shall
never
forget
how
glad
i
was
to
be
landed
in
a
little
quiet
for
my
head
was
beating
with
the
noise
of
carts
which
we
had
left
and
the
wearisomeness
of
the
disagreeable
objects
near
the
highway
but
with
my
first
pleasant
sensations
also
came
the
feeling
that
we
were
not
in
an
english
inn
partly
from
its
appearance
which
is
common
in
scotland
for
in
general
the
deal
wainscots
and
doors
are
unpainted
and
partly
from
the
dirtiness
of
the
floors
having
dined
william
and
i
walked
to
the
and
after
much
seeking
found
out
a
quiet
wherein
to
sit
down
and
read
our
letter
we
then
walked
a
considerable
time
in
the
streets
which
are
perhaps
as
handsome
as
streets
can
be
which
derive
no
particular
effect
from
their
situation
in
connexion
with
natural
advantages
such
as
rivers
sea
or
hills
the
trongate
an
old
street
is
very
picturesque
high
houses
with
an
intermixture
of
gable
fronts
towards
the
street
the
new

built
of
fine
stone
in
the
best
style
of
the
very
best
london
streets
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
but
not
being
of
brick
they
are
greatly
superior
one
thing
must
strike
every
stranger
in
his
first
walk
through
glasgow
an
appearance
of
business
and
bustle
but
no
coaches
or
gentlemen
carriages
during
all
the
time
we
walked
in
the
streets
i
only
saw
three
carriages
and
these
were
travelling
chaises
i
also
could
not
but
observe
a
want
of
cleanliness
in
the
appearance
of
the
lower
orders
of
the
people
and
a
dulness
in
the
dress
and
outside
of
the
whole
mass
as
they
moved
along
we
returned
to
the
inn
before
it
was
dark
i
had
a
bad
headache
and
was
tired
and
we
all
went
to
bed
soon
august
a
cold
morning
walked
to
the
a
large
field
bordering
on
the
clyde
the
banks
of
which
are
perfectly
flat
and
the
general
face
of
the
country
is
nearly
so
in
the
neighbourhood
of
glasgow
this
field
the
whole
summer
through
is
covered
with
women
of
all
ages
children
and
young
girls
spreading
out
their
linen
and
watching
it
while
it
bleaches
the
scene
must
be
very
cheerful
on
a
fine
day
but
it
rained
when
we
were
there
and
though
there
was
linen
spread
out
in
all
parts
and
great
numbers
of
women
and
girls
were
at
work
yet
there
would
have
been
many
more
on
a
fine
day
and
they
would
have
appeared
happy
instead
of
stupid
and
cheerless
in
the
middle
of
the
field
is
a
whither
the
inhabitants
of
this
large
town
rich
and
poor
send
or
carry
their
linen
to
be
washed
there
are
two
very
large
rooms
with
each
a
cistern
in
the
middle
for
hot
water
and
all
round
the
rooms
are
benches
for
the
women
to
set
their
tubs
upon
both
the
rooms
were
crowded
with
washers
there
might
be
a
hundred
or
two
or
even
three
for
it
is
not
easy
to
form
an
accurate
notion
of
so
great
a
number
however
the
rooms
were
large
and
they
were
both
full
it
was
amusing
to
see
so
many
women
arms
head
and
face
all
in
motion
all
busy
in
an
ordinary
household
employment
in
which
we
are
accustomed
to
see
at
the
most
only
three
or
four
women
employed
in
one
place
the
women
were
very
civil
i
learnt
from
them
the
regulations
of
the
house
but
i
have
forgotten
the
particulars
the
substance
of
them
is
that
so
much
is
to
be
paid
for
each
tub
of
water
so
much
for
a
tub
and
the
privilege
of
washing
for
a
day
and
so
much
to
the
general
overlookers
of
the
linen
when
it
is
left
to
be
bleached
an
old
man
and
woman
have
this
office
who
were
walking
about
two
melancholy
figures

glasgow
j
the
shops
at
glasgow
are
large
and
like
london
shops
and
we
passed
by
the
largest
i
ever
saw
you
look
across
the
piazza
of
the
exchange
and
see
to
the
end
of
the
where
there
is
a
circular
window

width
of
the
room
perhaps
there
might
be
thirty
gentlemen
sitting
on
the
circular
bench
of
the
window
each
reading
a
newspaper
they
had
the
appearance
of
figures
in
a
fantoccine
or
men
seen
at
the
extremity
of
the
diminished
into
puppets
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
see
the
high
church
both
william
and
i
were
tired
and
it
rained
very
hard
after
we
had
left
the
besides
i
am
less
eager
to
walk
in
a
large
town
than
anywhere
else
so
we
put
it
off
and
i
have
since
repented
of
my
irresolution
dined
and
left
glasgow
at
about
three
in
a
heavy
rain
we
were
obliged
to
ride
through
the
streets
to
keep
our
feet
dry
and
in
spite
of
the
rain
every
person
as
we
went
along
stayed
his
steps
to
look
at
us
indeed
we
had
the
pleasure
of
spreading
smiles
from
one
end
of
glasgow
to
the
other
for
we
travelled
the
whole
length
of
the
town
a
set
of
schoolboys
perhaps
there
might
be
eight
with
satchels
over
their
shoulders
and
except
one
or
two
without
shoes
and
stockings
yet
very
well
dressed
in
jackets
and
trousers
like
children
followed
us
in
great
delight
admiring
the
car
and
longing
to
jump
up
at
last
though
we
were
seated
they
made
several
attempts
to
get
on
behind
and
they
looked
so
pretty
and
wild
and
at
the
same
time
so
modest
that
we
wished
to
give
them
a
ride
and
there
being
a
little
hill
near
the
end
of
the
town
we
got
off
and
four
of
them
who
still
remained
the
rest
having
dropped
into
their
homes
by
the
way
took
our
places
and
indeed
i
would
have
walked
two
miles
willingly
to
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
so
happy
when
they
were
to
ride
no
longer
they
scampered
away
laughing
and
rejoicing
new
houses
are
rising
up
in
great
numbers
round
glasgow
houses
and
new
plantations
chiefly
of
fir
the
fields
are
frequently
enclosed
by
hedgerows
but
there
is
no
richness
nor
any
particular
beauty
for
some
miles
the
first
object
that
interested
us
was
a
gentleman
house
upon
a
green
plain
or
holm
almost
close
to
the
clyde
sheltered
by
tall
trees
a
quiet
modest
mansion
and
though
being
an
old
building
and
no
other
house
near
it
or
in
connexion
with
it
and
standing
upon
the
level
field
which
belonged
to
it
its
own
domain
the
whole
scene
together
brought
to
our
minds
an
image
of
the
retiredness
and
sober
elegance
of
a
nunnery
but
this
might
be
owing
to
the
greyness
of
the
afternoon
and
our
having
come
immediately
from
glasgow
and
through
a
country
which
till
now
had
either
had
a
townish
taint
or
at
best
little
of
rural
beauty
while
we
were
looking
at
the
house
we
overtook
a
who
like
many
others
began
to
talk
about
our
car
we
alighted
to
walk
up
a
hill
and
continuing
the
conversation
the
man
told
us
with
something
like
a
national
pride
that
it
belonged
to
a
scotch
lord
lord
semple
he
added
that
a
little
further
on
we
should
see
a
much
finer
prospect
as
fine
a
one
as
ever
we
had
seen
in
our
lives
accordingly
when
we
came
to
the
top
of
the
hill
it
opened
upon
us
most
magnificently
we
saw
the
clyde
now
a
stately
winding
away
mile
after
mile
spotted
with
boats
and
ships
each
side
of
the
river
hilly
the
right
populous
with
single
houses
and
villages
dunglass
castle
upon
a
promontory
the
whole
view
terminated
by
the
rock
of
dumbarton
at
five
or
six
miles
distance
which
stands
by
itself
without
any
hills
near
it
like
a
we
travelled
for
some
time
near
the
river
passing
through
clusters
of
houses
which
seemed
to
owe
their
existence
rather
to
the
wealth
of
the
river
than
the
land
for
the
banks
were
mostly
bare
and
the
soil
appeared
poor
even
near
the
water
the
left
side
of
the
river
was
generally
uninhabited
and
moorish
yet
there
are
some
beautiful
spots
for
instance
a
nobleman
house
where
the
fields
and
trees
were
rich
and
in
combination
with
the
river
looked
very
lovely
as
we
went
along
william
and
i
were
reminded
of
the
views
upon
the
thames
in
kent
which
though
greatly
superior
in
richness
and
softness
are
much
inferior
in
grandeur
not
far
from
dumbarton
we
passed
under
some
rocky
hills
which
were
so
like
some
of
the
hills
near
grasmere
that
we
could
have
half
believed
they
were
the
same
arrived
at
dumbarton
before
it
was
dark
having
pushed
on
briskly
that
we
might
have
start
of
a
traveller
at
the
inn
who
was
following
us
as
fast
as
he
could
in
a
gig
every
front
room
was
full
and
we
were
afraid
we
should
not
have
been
admitted
they
put
us
into
a
little
parlour
dirty
and
smelling
of
liquors
the
table
uncleaned
and
not
a
chair
in
its
place
we
were
glad
however
of
our
sorry
accommodations

no

erskine
house
the
seat
of
lord
blantyre
while
tea
was
preparing
we
lolled
at
our
ease
and
though
the
overlooked
the
and
at
our
entrance
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
but
gloom
and
unloveliness
yet
while
i
lay
stretched
upon
the
carriage
cushions
on
three
chairs
i
discovered
a
little
side
peep
which
was
enough
to
set
the
mind
at
work
it
was
no
more
than
a
smoky
vessel
lying
at
anchor
with
its
bare
masts
a
clay
hut
and
the
shelving
bank
of
the
river
with
a
green
pasture
above
perhaps
you
will
think
that
there
is
not
much
in
this
as
i
describe
it
it
is
true
but
the
effect
produced
by
these
simple
objects
as
they
happened
to
be
combined
together
with
the
gloom
of
the
evening
was
exceedingly
wild
our
room
was
parted
by
a
slender
partition
from
a
large
in
which
were
a
number
of
officers
and
their
wives
who
after
the
first
hour
never
ceased
singing
dancing
laughing
or
loud
talking
the
ladies
sang
some
pretty
songs
a
great
relief
to
us
we
went
early
to
bed
but
poor
coleridge
could
not
sleep
for
the
noise
at
the
street
door
he
lay
in
the
parlour
below
stairs
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
in
the
best
inns
of
scotland
to
have
beds
in
the
august
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
william
and
i
walked
towards
the
castle
a
short
mile
from
the
town
we
overtook
two
young
men
who
on
our
asking
the
road
offered
to
conduct
us
though
it
might
seem
it
was
not
easy
to
miss
our
way
for
the
rock
rises
singly
by
itself
from
the
plain
on
which
the
town
stands
the
rock
of
dumbarton
is
very
grand
when
you
are
close
to
it
but
at
a
little
distance
under
an
ordinary
sky
and
in
open
day
it
is
not
grand
but
curiously
wild
the
castle
and
fortifications
add
little
effect
to
the
general
view
of
the
rock
especially
since
the
building
of
a
modern
house
which
is
and
consequently
jars
wherever
it
is
seen
with
the
natural
character
of
the
place
there
is
a
path
up
to
the
house
but
it
being
low
water
we
could
walk
round
the
rock
which
we
resolved
to
do
on
that
side
next
the
town
green
grass
grows
to
a
considerable
height
up
the
rock
but
wherever
the
river
borders
upon
it
it
is
naked
stone
i
never
saw
rock
in
nobler
masses
or
more
deeply
stained
by
time
and
weather
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
for
it
is
in
the
very
eye
of
and
of
mountain
winds
and
water
winds
it
is
of
all
colours
but
a
rusty
yellow
predominates
as
we
walked
along
we
could
not
but
look
up
continually
and
the
mass
above
being
on
every
side
so
huge
it
appeared
more
wonderful
than
when
we
saw
the
whole
together
we
sat
down
on
one
of
the
large
stones
which
lie
scattered
near
the
base
of
the
rock
with
growing
amongst
them
above
our
heads
the
rock
was
perpendicular
for
a
considerable
height
nay
as
it
seemed
to
the
very
top
and
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
a
few
sheep
two
of
them
rams
with
twisted
horns
stood
as
if
on
the
over
the
wide
country
at
the
same
time
we
saw
a
sentinel
in
his
red
coat
walking
backwards
and
forwards
between
us
and
the
sky
with
his
firelock
over
his
shoulder
the
sheep
i
suppose
owing
to
our
being
accustomed
to
see
them
in
similar
situations
appeared
to
retain
their
real
size
while
on
the
contrary
the
soldier
seemed
to
be
diminished
by
the
distance
till
he
almost
looked
like
a
puppet
moved
with
wires
for
the
pleasure
of
children
or
an
eight
years
old
drummer
in
his
stiff
manly
dress
beside
a
company
of
grenadiers
i
had
never
before
perhaps
thought
of
sheep
and
men
in
soldiers
dresses
at
the
same
time
and
here
they
were
brought
together
in
a
strange
fantastic
way
as
will
be
easily
conceived
the
fearlessness
and
stillness
of
those
quiet
creatures
on
the
brow
of
the
rock
pursuing
their
natural
occupations
contrasted
with
the
restless
and
apparently
unmeaning
motions
of
the
dwarf
soldier
added
not
a
little
to
the
general
effect
of
this
place
which
is
that
of
wild
singularity
and
the
whole
was
aided
by
a
blustering
wind
and
a
gloomy
sky
coleridge
joined
us
and
we
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
rock
the
road
to
a
considerable
height
is
through
a
narrow
cleft
in
which
a
flight
of
steps
is
hewn
the
steps
nearly
fill
the
cleft
and
on
each
side
the
rocks
form
a
high
and
irregular
wall
it
is
almost
like
a
long
sloping
cavern
only
that
it
is
roofed
by
the
sky
we
came
to
the
barracks
soldiers
wives
were
hanging
out
linen
upon
the
rails
while
the
wind
beat
about
them
furiously
there
was
nothing
which
it
could
set
in
motion
but
the
garments
of
the
women
and
the
linen
upon
the
rails
the
grass
for
we
had
now
come
to
green
grass
was
close
and
smooth
and
not
one
pile
an
inch
above
another
and
neither
tree
nor
shrub
the
standard
pole
stood
erect
without
a
flag
the
rock
has
two
summits
one
much
broader
and
higher
than
the
other
when
we
were
near
to
the
top
of
the
lower
eminence
we
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
a
little
garden
of
flowers
and
vegetables
belonging
to
the
soldiers
there
are
three
distinct
and
very
noble
prospects
the
first
up
the
clyde
towards
glasgow
dunglass
castle
seen
on
its
promontory
boats
sloops
hills
and
many
buildings
the
second
down
the
river
to
the
sea
greenock
and
and
the
distant
mountains
at
the
entrance
of
loch
long
and
the
third
extensive
and
distant
view
is
up
the
leven
which
here
falls
into
the
clyde
to
the
mountains
of
loch
lomond
the
distant
mountains
in
all
these
views
were
obscured
by
mists
and
dingy
clouds
but
if
the
grand
outline
of
any
one
of
the
views
can
be
seen
it
is
sufficient
recompense
for
the
trouble
of
climbing
the
rock
of
dumbarton
the
soldier
who
was
our
guide
told
us
that
an
old
ruin
which
we
came
to
at
the
top
of
the
higher
eminence
had
been
a
an
inconvenient
station
though
certainly
a
glorious
place
for
wind
perhaps
if
it
really
had
been
a
it
was
only
for
the
use
of
the
garrison
we
looked
over
cannons
on
the
and
saw
in
an
open
field
below
the
yeomanry
cavalry
exercising
while
we
could
hear
from
the
town
which
was
full
of
soldiers
dumbarton
drums
beat
bonny
o
yet
while
we
stood
upon
this
eminence
rising
up
so
far
as
it
does
inland
and
having
the
habitual
old
english
feeling
of
our
own
security
as
islanders
we
could
not
help
looking
upon
the
fortress
in
spite
of
its
cannon
and
soldiers
and
the
rumours
of
invasion
as
set
up
against
the
hostilities
of
wind
and
weather
rather
than
for
any
other
warfare
on
our
return
we
were
invited
into
the
about
down
the
rock
where
we
were
shown
a
large
rusty
sword
which
they
called
wallace
sword
and
a
trout
boxed
up
in
a
well
close
by
where
they
said
he
had
been
confined
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
for
the
pleasure
of
the
soldiers
who
were
anxious
that
we
should
see
him
we
took
some
pains
to
spy
him
out
in
his
black
den
and
at
last
succeeded
it
was
pleasing
to
observe
how
much
interest
the
poor
soldiers
though
themselves
probably
new
to
the
place
seemed
to
attach
to
this
antiquated
inhabitant
of
their
garrison
when
we
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
rock
along
the
same
road
by
which
we
had
ascended
we
made
our
way
over
the
rough
stones
left
bare
by
the
tide
round
the
bottom
of
the
rock
to
the
point
where
we
had
set
off
this
is
a
wild
and
melancholy
walk
on
a
blustering
cloudy
day
the
naked
bed
of
the
river
scattered
over
with
grey
swampy
fields
on
the
other
shore
flying
overhead
the
high
rock
perpendicular
and
bare
we
came
to
two
very
large
fragments
which
had
fallen
from
the
main
rock
coleridge
thought
that
one
of
them
was
as
large
as
william
and
i
did
not
but
it
is
impossible
to
judge
accurately
we
probably
without
knowing
it
compared
them
with
the
whole
mass
from
which
they
had
fallen
which
from
its
situation
we
consider
as
one
rock
or
stone
and
there
is
no
object
of
the
kind
for
comparison
with
the
when
we
leave
the
shore
of
the
clyde
grass
begins
to
show
itself
on
the
rock
go
a
considerable
way
still
under
the
rock
along
a
flat
field
and
pass
immediately
below
the
white
house
which
wherever
seen
looks
so
ugly
footnote
a
rock
in
borrowdale
ed
left
dumbarton
at
about
eleven
the
sky
was
cheerless
and
the
air
ungenial
which
we
regretted
as
we
were
going
to
loch
lomond
and
wished
to
greet
the
first
of
the
scottish
lakes
with
our
cheerfullest
and
best
feelings
crossed
the
leven
at
the
end
of
dumbarton
and
when
we
looked
behind
had
a
pleasing
view
of
the
town
bridge
and
rock
but
when
we
took
in
a
reach
of
the
river
at
the
distance
of
perhaps
half
a
mile
the
swamp
ground
being
so
near
a
town
and
not
in
its
natural
wildness
but
seemingly
half
cultivated
with
houses
here
and
there
gave
us
an
idea
of
extreme
poverty
of
soil
or
that
the
inhabitants
were
either
indolent
or
miserable
we
had
to
travel
four
miles
on
the
banks
of
the
water
of
leven
before
we
should
come
to
loch
lomond
having
expected
a
grand
river
from
so
grand
a
lake
we
were
disappointed
for
it
appeared
to
me
not
to
be
very
much
larger
than
the
emont
and
is
not
near
so
beautiful
but
we
must
not
forget
that
the
day
was
cold
and
gloomy
near
dumbarton
it
is
like
a
river
in
a
flat
country
or
under
the
influence
of
tides
but
a
little
higher
up
it
resembles
one
of
our
rivers
flowing
through
a
vale
of
no
extreme
beauty
though
prettily
wooded
the
hills
on
each
side
not
very
high
sloping
backwards
from
the
bed
of
the
vale
which
is
neither
very
narrow
nor
very
wide
the
prospect
terminated
by
ben
lomond
and
other
mountains
the
vale
is
populous
but
looks
as
if
it
were
not
inhabited
by
cultivators
of
the
earth
the
houses
are
chiefly
of
stone
often
in
rows
by
the
they
stand
pleasantly
but
have
a
tradish
look
as
if
they
might
have
been
from
glasgow
we
saw
many
but
no
other
symptom
of
a
manufactory
except
something
in
the
houses
that
was
not
rural
and
a
want
of
independent
comforts
perhaps
if
the
river
had
been
glittering
in
the
sun
and
the
smoke
of
the
cottages
rising
in
distinct
volumes
towards
the
sky
as
i
have
seen
in
the
vale
or
basin
below
pillsden
in
dorsetshire
when
every
cottage
hidden
from
the
eye
pointed
out
its
by
an
upright
wreath
of
white
smoke
the
whole
scene
might
have
excited
ideas
of
perfect
cheerfulness
here
as
on
the
nith
and
much
more
than
in
the
trough
of
the
clyde
a
great
portion
of
the
ground
was
uncultivated
but
the
hills
being
less
wild
the
river
more
stately
and
the
ground
not
heaved
up
so
irregularly
and
tossed
about
the
imperfect
cultivation
was
the
more
to
be
lamented
particularly
as
there
were
so
many
houses
near
the
river
in
a
small
enclosure
by
the
wayside
is
a
pillar
erected
to
the
memory
of
smollett
who
was
born
in
a
village
at
a
little
distance
which
we
could
see
at
the
same
time
and
where
i
believe
some
of
the
family
still
reside
there
is
a
long
latin
inscription
which
coleridge
translated
for
my
benefit
the
latin
is
miserably
bad
as
coleridge
said
such
as
poor
smollett
who
was
an
excellent
scholar
would
have
been
ashamed
of
footnote
the
inscription
on
the
pillar
was
written
by
professor
george
stuart
of
edinburgh
john
ramsay
of
ochtertyre
and
samuel
johnson
for
johnson
share
in
the
work
see
croker
boswell
p
j
before
we
came
to
loch
lomond
the
vale
widened
and
became
less
populous
we
climbed
over
a
wall
into
a
large
field
to
have
a
better
front
view
of
the
lake
than
from
the
road
this
view
is
very
much
like
that
from
clarkson
windows
the
mountain
in
front
resembles
hallan
indeed
is
almost
the
same
but
ben
lomond
is
not
seen
standing
in
such
majestic
company
as
helvellyn
and
the
meadows
are
less
beautiful
than
ulswater
the
reach
of
the
lake
is
very
magnificent
you
see
it
as
ulswater
is
seen
beyond
the
promontory
of
old
church
winding
away
behind
a
large
woody
island
that
looks
like
a
promontory
the
outlet
of
the
lake
we
had
a
distinct
view
of
it
in
the
field
is
very
insignificant
the
bulk
of
the
river
is
frittered
away
by
small
alder
bushes
as
i
recollect
i
do
not
remember
that
it
was
reedy
but
the
ground
had
a
swampy
appearance
and
here
the
vale
spreads
out
wide
and
shapeless
as
if
the
river
were
born
to
no
inheritance
had
no
sheltering
cradle
no
hills
of
its
own
as
we
have
seen
this
does
not
continue
long
it
flows
through
a
distinct
though
not
a
magnificent
vale
but
having
lost
the
pastoral
character
which
it
had
in
the
youthful
days
of
smollett
if
the
description
in
his
ode
to
his
native
stream
be
a
faithful
one
it
is
less
interesting
than
it
was
then
the
road
carried
us
sometimes
close
to
the
lake
sometimes
at
a
considerable
distance
from
it
over
moorish
grounds
or
through
enclosures
we
had
the
lake
on
our
right
which
is
here
so
wide
that
the
opposite
hills
not
being
high
are
cast
into
insignificance
and
we
could
not
distinguish
any
buildings
near
the
water
if
any
there
were
it
is
however
always
delightful
to
travel
by
a
lake
of
clear
waters
if
you
see
nothing
else
but
a
very
ordinary
country
but
we
had
some
beautiful
distant
views
one
in
particular
down
the
high
road
through
a
vista
of
trees
and
the
near
shore
was
frequently
very
pleasing
with
its
gravel
banks
bendings
and
small
bays
in
one
part
it
was
bordered
for
a
considerable
way
by
irregular
groups
of
forest
trees
or
single
stragglers
which
although
not
large
seemed
old
their
branches
were
stunted
and
knotty
as
if
they
had
been
striving
with
storms
and
had
half
yielded
to
them
under
these
trees
we
had
a
variety
of
pleasing
views
across
the
lake
and
the
very
rolling
over
the
road
and
looking
at
its
smooth
and
beautiful
surface
was
itself
a
pleasure
it
was
as
smooth
as
a
gravel
walk
and
of
the
bluish
colour
of
some
of
the
roads
among
the
lakes
of
the
north
of
england
passed
no
very
remarkable
place
till
we
came
to
sir
james
house
which
stands
upon
a
large
flat
woody
peninsula
looking
towards
ben
lomond
there
must
be
many
beautiful
walks
among
the
copses
of
the
peninsula
and
delicious
views
over
the
water
but
the
general
surface
of
the
country
is
poor
and
looks
as
if
it
ought
to
be
rich
and
well
peopled
for
it
is
not
mountainous
nor
had
we
passed
any
hills
which
a
cumbrian
would
dignify
with
the
name
of
mountains
there
was
many
a
little
plain
or
hill
covered
with
poor
heath
or
broom
without
trees
where
one
should
have
liked
to
see
a
cottage
in
a
bower
of
wood
with
its
patch
of
corn
and
potatoes
and
a
green
field
with
a
hedge
to
keep
it
warm
as
we
advanced
we
perceived
less
of
the
coldness
of
poverty
the
hills
not
having
so
large
a
space
between
them
and
the
lake
the
surface
of
the
hills
being
in
its
natural
state
is
always
beautiful
but
where
there
is
only
a
half
cultivated
and
half
peopled
soil
near
the
banks
of
a
lake
or
river
the
idea
is
forced
upon
one
that
they
who
do
live
there
have
not
much
of
cheerful
enjoyment
but
soon
we
came
to
just
such
a
place
as
we
had
wanted
to
see
the
road
was
close
to
the
water
and
a
hill
bare
rocky
or
with
scattered
copses
rose
above
it
a
deep
shade
hung
over
the
road
where
some
little
boys
were
at
play
we
expected
a
of
some
sort
and
when
we
came
nearer
saw
three
or
four
thatched
huts
under
the
trees
and
at
the
same
moment
felt
that
it
was
a
paradise
we
had
before
seen
the
lake
only
as
one
wide
plain
of
water
but
here
the
portion
of
it
which
we
saw
was
bounded
by
a
high
and
steep
heathy
and
woody
island
opposite
which
did
not
appear
like
an
island
but
the
main
shore
and
framed
out
a
little
oblong
lake
apparently
not
so
broad
as
with
one
small
island
covered
with
trees
resembling
some
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
holms
of
windermere
and
only
a
narrow
river
breadth
from
the
shore
this
was
a
place
where
we
should
have
liked
to
have
lived
and
the
only
one
we
had
seen
near
loch
lomond
how
delightful
to
have
a
little
shed
concealed
under
the
branches
of
the
fairy
island
the
cottages
and
the
island
might
have
been
made
for
the
pleasure
of
each
other
it
was
but
like
a
natural
garden
the
distance
was
so
small
nay
one
could
not
have
forgiven
any
one
living
there
not
compelled
to
daily
labour
if
he
did
not
connect
it
with
his
dwelling
by
some
feeling
of
domestic
attachment
like
what
he
has
for
the
orchard
where
his
children
play
i
thought
what
a
place
for
william
he
might
row
himself
over
with
twenty
strokes
of
the
oars
escaping
from
the
business
of
the
house
and
as
safe
from
intruders
with
his
boat
anchored
beside
him
as
if
he
had
locked
himself
up
in
the
strong
tower
of
a
castle
we
were
unwilling
to
leave
this
sweet
spot
but
it
was
so
simple
and
therefore
so
rememberable
that
it
seemed
almost
as
if
we
could
have
carried
it
away
with
us
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
small
lake
enclosed
by
trees
at
the
ends
and
by
the
and
opposite
by
the
island
a
steep
bank
on
which
the
purple
heath
was
seen
under
low
oak
a
group
of
houses
by
trees
and
a
bending
road
there
was
one
remarkable
tree
an
old
larch
with
hairy
branches
which
sent
out
its
main
stem
horizontally
across
the
road
an
object
that
seemed
to
have
been
singled
out
for
injury
where
everything
else
was
lovely
and
thriving
tortured
into
that
shape
by
storms
which
one
might
have
thought
could
not
have
reached
it
in
that
sheltered
place
we
were
now
entering
into
the
highlands
i
believe
luss
is
the
place
where
we
were
told
that
country
begins
but
at
these
cottages
i
would
have
gladly
believed
that
we
were
there
for
it
was
like
a
new
region
the
huts
were
after
the
highland
fashion
and
the
boys
who
were
playing
wore
the
highland
dress
and
philabeg
on
going
into
a
new
country
i
seem
to
myself
to
waken
up
and
afterwards
it
surprises
me
to
remember
how
much
alive
i
have
been
to
the
distinctions
of
dress
household
arrangements
etc
and
what
a
spirit
these
little
things
give
to
wild
barren
or
ordinary
places
the
cottages
are
within
about
two
miles
of
luss
came
in
view
of
several
islands
but
the
lake
being
so
very
wide
we
could
see
little
of
their
peculiar
beauties
and
they
being
large
hardly
looked
like
islands
passed
another
gentleman
house
which
stands
prettily
in
a
bay
and
soon
after
reached
luss
where
we
intended
to
lodge
on
seeing
the
outside
of
the
inn
we
were
glad
that
we
were
to
have
such
pleasant
quarters
it
is
a
white
house
by
the
but
there
was
not
much
promise
of
hospitality
when
we
stopped
at
the
door
no
person
came
out
till
we
had
shouted
a
considerable
time
a
barefooted
lass
showed
me
and
again
my
hopes
revived
the
house
was
clean
for
a
scotch
inn
and
the
view
very
pleasant
to
the
lake
over
the
top
of
the
village
a
cluster
of
thatched
houses
among
trees
with
a
large
chapel
in
the
midst
of
them
like
most
of
the
scotch
kirks
which
we
had
seen
this
building
resembles
a
big
house
but
it
is
a
much
more
pleasing
building
than
they
generally
are
and
has
one
of
our
rustic
belfries
not
unlike
that
at
ambleside
with
two
bells
hanging
in
the
open
air
we
chose
one
of
the
back
rooms
to
sit
in
being
more
snug
and
they
looked
upon
a
very
sweet
prospect
a
stream
tumbling
down
a
cleft
or
glen
on
the
rocky
coppice
ground
a
rural
lane
such
as
we
have
from
house
to
house
at
grasmere
and
a
few
we
had
a
poor
dinner
and
sour
ale
but
as
long
as
the
people
were
civil
we
were
contented
footnote
camstraddan
house
and
j
coleridge
was
not
well
so
he
did
not
stir
out
but
william
and
i
walked
through
the
village
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
when
i
came
close
to
the
houses
i
could
not
but
regret
a
want
of
loveliness
correspondent
with
the
beauty
of
the
situation
and
the
appearance
of
the
village
at
a
little
distance
not
a
single
ornamented
garden
we
saw
potatoes
and
cabbages
but
never
a
honeysuckle
yet
there
were
wild
gardens
as
beautiful
as
any
that
ever
man
cultivated
overgrowing
the
roofs
of
some
of
the
cottages
flowers
and
creeping
plants
how
elegant
were
the
wreaths
of
the
bramble
that
had
built
its
own
bower
upon
the
riggins
in
several
parts
of
the
village
therefore
we
had
chiefly
to
regret
the
want
of
gardens
as
they
are
symptoms
of
leisure
and
comfort
or
at
least
of
no
painful
industry
here
we
first
saw
houses
without
windows
the
smoke
coming
out
of
the
open
the
chimneys
were
like
stools
with
four
legs
a
hole
being
left
in
the
roof
for
the
smoke
and
over
that
a
slate
placed
upon
four
sticks
sometimes
the
whole
leaned
as
if
it
were
going
to
fall
the
fields
close
to
luss
lie
flat
to
the
lake
and
a
river
as
large
as
our
stream
near
the
church
at
grasmere
flows
by
the
end
of
the
village
being
the
same
which
comes
down
the
glen
behind
the
inn
it
is
very
much
like
our
stream
beds
of
blue
pebbles
upon
the
shores
we
walked
towards
the
head
of
the
lake
and
from
a
large
pasture
field
near
luss
a
gentle
eminence
had
a
very
interesting
view
back
upon
the
village
and
the
lake
and
islands
beyond
we
then
perceived
that
luss
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
spacious
bay
and
that
close
to
it
lay
another
small
one
within
the
larger
where
the
boats
of
the
inhabitants
were
lying
at
anchor
a
beautiful
natural
harbour
the
islands
as
we
look
down
the
water
are
seen
in
great
beauty
the
same
that
framed
out
the
little
peaceful
lake
which
we
had
passed
in
the
morning
towers
above
the
rest
the
lake
is
very
wide
here
and
the
opposite
shores
not
being
lofty
the
chief
part
of
the
permanent
beauty
of
this
view
is
among
the
islands
and
on
the
near
shore
including
the
low
promontories
of
the
bay
of
luss
and
the
village
and
we
saw
it
under
its
dullest
aspect
the
air
cold
the
sky
gloomy
without
a
glimpse
of
sunshine
on
a
splendid
evening
with
the
light
of
the
sun
diffused
over
the
whole
islands
distant
hills
and
the
broad
expanse
of
the
lake
with
its
creeks
bays
and
little
slips
of
water
among
the
islands
it
must
be
a
glorious
sight
up
the
lake
there
are
no
islands
ben
lomond
terminates
the
view
without
any
other
large
mountains
no
clouds
were
upon
it
therefore
we
saw
the
whole
size
and
form
of
the
mountain
yet
it
did
not
appear
to
me
so
large
as
skiddaw
does
from
continued
our
walk
a
considerable
way
towards
the
head
of
the
lake
and
went
up
a
high
hill
but
saw
no
other
reach
of
the
water
the
hills
on
the
luss
side
become
much
steeper
and
the
lake
having
narrowed
a
little
above
luss
was
no
longer
a
very
wide
lake
where
we
lost
sight
of
it
came
to
a
bark
hut
by
the
shores
and
sate
for
some
time
under
the
shelter
of
it
while
we
were
here
a
poor
woman
with
a
little
child
by
her
side
begged
a
penny
of
me
and
asked
where
she
could
find
quarters
in
the
village
she
was
a
travelling
beggar
a
native
of
scotland
had
often
heard
of
that
water
but
was
never
there
before
this
appearance
while
the
wind
was
rustling
about
us
and
the
waves
breaking
at
our
feet
was
very
melancholy
the
waters
looked
wide
the
hills
many
and
dark
and
far
off
no
house
but
at
luss
i
thought
what
a
dreary
waste
must
this
lake
be
to
such
poor
creatures
struggling
with
fatigue
and
poverty
and
unknown
ways
we
ordered
tea
when
we
reached
the
inn
and
desired
the
girl
to
light
us
a
fire
she
replied
i
dinna
ken
whether
she
gie
fire
meaning
her
mistress
we
told
her
we
did
not
wish
her
mistress
to
give
fire
we
only
desired
her
to
let
make
it
and
we
would
pay
for
it
the
girl
brought
in
the
but
no
fire
and
when
i
asked
if
she
was
coming
to
light
it
she
said
her
mistress
was
not
varra
willing
to
gie
fire
at
last
however
on
our
insisting
upon
it
the
fire
was
lighted
we
got
tea
by
candlelight
and
spent
a
comfortable
evening
i
had
seen
the
landlady
before
we
went
out
for
as
had
been
usual
in
all
the
country
inns
there
was
a
demur
respecting
beds
notwithstanding
the
house
was
empty
and
there
were
at
least
spare
beds
her
countenance
corresponded
with
the
unkindness
of
denying
us
a
fire
on
a
cold
night
for
she
was
the
most
cruel
and
woman
i
ever
saw
she
was
overgrown
with
fat
and
was
sitting
with
her
feet
and
legs
in
a
tub
of
water
for
the
dropsy
probably
brought
on
by
the
sympathy
which
i
felt
and
expressed
for
her
on
seeing
her
in
this
wretched
condition
for
her
legs
were
swollen
as
thick
as
seemed
to
produce
no
effect
and
i
was
obliged
after
five
minutes
conversation
to
leave
the
affair
of
the
beds
undecided
coleridge
had
some
talk
with
her
daughter
a
smart
lass
in
a
cotton
gown
with
a
bandeau
round
her
head
without
shoes
and
stockings
she
told
coleridge
with
some
pride
that
she
had
not
spent
all
her
time
at
luss
but
was
then
fresh
from
glasgow
it
came
on
a
very
stormy
night
the
wind
rattled
every
window
in
the
house
and
it
rained
heavily
william
and
coleridge
had
bad
beds
in
a
room
in
the
garrets
though
there
were
empty
rooms
on
the
first
floor
and
they
were
disturbed
by
a
drunken
man
who
had
come
to
the
inn
when
we
were
gone
to
sleep
august
we
were
glad
when
we
awoke
to
see
that
it
was
a
fine
morning
the
sky
was
bright
blue
with
clouds
the
hills
cheerful
lights
and
shadows
vivid
and
distinct
the
village
looked
exceedingly
beautiful
this
morning
from
the
garret
windows
the
stream
glittering
near
it
while
it
flowed
under
trees
through
the
level
fields
to
the
lake
after
breakfast
william
and
i
went
down
to
the
the
roads
were
as
dry
as
if
no
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
which
added
to
the
pure
cheerfulness
of
the
appearance
of
the
village
and
even
of
the
distant
prospect
an
effect
which
i
always
seem
to
perceive
from
clearly
bright
roads
for
they
are
always
brightened
by
rain
after
a
storm
but
when
we
came
among
the
houses
i
regretted
even
more
than
last
night
because
the
contrast
was
greater
the
slovenliness
and
dirt
near
the
doors
and
could
not
but
remember
with
pain
from
the
contrast
the
cottages
of
somersetshire
covered
with
roses
and
myrtle
and
their
small
gardens
of
herbs
and
flowers
while
lingering
by
the
shore
we
began
to
talk
with
a
man
who
offered
to
row
us
to
but
the
sky
began
to
darken
and
the
wind
being
high
we
doubted
whether
we
should
venture
therefore
made
no
engagement
he
offered
to
sell
me
some
thread
pointing
to
his
cottage
and
added
that
many
english
ladies
carried
thread
away
from
luss
presently
after
coleridge
joined
us
and
we
determined
to
go
to
the
island
i
was
sorry
that
the
man
who
had
been
talking
with
us
was
not
our
boatman
william
by
some
chance
had
engaged
another
we
had
two
rowers
and
a
strong
boat
so
i
felt
myself
bold
though
there
was
a
great
chance
of
a
high
wind
the
nearest
point
of
is
not
perhaps
more
than
a
mile
and
a
quarter
from
luss
we
did
not
land
there
but
rowed
round
the
end
and
landed
on
that
side
which
looks
towards
our
favourite
cottages
and
their
own
island
which
wherever
seen
is
still
their
own
it
rained
a
little
when
we
landed
and
i
took
my
cloak
which
afterwards
served
us
to
sit
down
upon
in
our
road
up
the
hill
when
the
day
grew
much
finer
with
gleams
of
sunshine
this
island
belongs
to
sir
james
colquhoun
who
has
made
a
convenient
road
that
winds
gently
to
the
top
of
it
we
had
not
climbed
far
before
we
were
stopped
by
a
sudden
burst
of
prospect
so
singular
and
beautiful
that
it
was
like
a
flash
of
images
from
another
world
we
stood
with
our
backs
to
the
hill
of
the
island
which
we
were
ascending
and
which
shut
out
ben
lomond
entirely
and
all
the
upper
part
of
the
lake
and
we
looked
towards
the
foot
of
the
lake
scattered
over
with
islands
without
beginning
and
without
end
the
sun
shone
and
the
distant
hills
were
visible
some
through
sunny
mists
others
in
gloom
with
patches
of
sunshine
the
lake
was
lost
under
the
low
and
distant
hills
and
the
islands
lost
in
the
lake
which
was
all
in
motion
with
travelling
fields
of
light
or
dark
shadows
under
rainy
clouds
there
are
many
hills
but
no
commanding
eminence
at
a
distance
to
confine
the
prospect
so
that
the
land
seemed
endless
as
the
water
what
i
had
heard
of
loch
lomond
or
any
other
place
in
great
britain
had
given
me
no
idea
of
anything
like
what
we
beheld
it
was
an
outlandish
scene
we
might
have
believed
ourselves
in
north
america
the
islands
were
of
every
possible
variety
of
shape
and
surface
hilly
and
level
large
and
small
bare
rocky
pastoral
or
covered
with
wood
immediately
under
my
eyes
lay
one
large
flat
island
bare
and
green
so
flat
and
low
that
it
scarcely
appeared
to
rise
above
the
water
with
straggling
and
a
single
hut
upon
one
of
its
promontories
for
it
was
of
a
very
irregular
shape
though
perfectly
flat
another
its
next
neighbour
and
still
nearer
to
us
was
covered
over
with
heath
and
the
surface
undulating
with
flat
or
sloping
banks
towards
the
water
and
hollow
places
valleys
behind
these
two
islands
with
where
we
were
standing
were
intermingled
with
the
water
i
might
say
interbedded
and
interveined
with
it
in
a
manner
that
was
exquisitely
pleasing
there
were
bays
innumerable
straits
or
passages
like
calm
rivers
landlocked
lakes
and
to
the
main
water
stormy
promontories
the
solitary
hut
on
the
flat
green
island
seemed
unsheltered
and
desolate
and
yet
not
wholly
so
for
it
was
but
a
broad
river
breadth
from
the
covert
of
the
wood
of
the
other
island
near
to
these
is
a
miniature
an
islet
covered
with
trees
on
which
stands
a
small
ruin
that
looks
like
the
remains
of
a
religious
house
it
is
overgrown
with
ivy
and
were
it
not
that
the
arch
of
a
window
or
gateway
may
be
distinctly
seen
it
would
be
difficult
to
believe
that
it
was
not
a
tuft
of
trees
growing
in
the
shape
of
a
ruin
rather
than
a
ruin
overshadowed
by
trees
when
we
had
walked
a
little
further
we
saw
below
us
on
the
nearest
large
island
where
some
of
the
wood
had
been
cut
down
a
hut
which
we
conjectured
to
be
a
bark
hut
it
appeared
to
be
on
the
shore
of
a
little
forest
lake
enclosed
by
where
we
were
and
the
woody
island
on
which
the
hut
stands
beyond
we
had
the
same
intricate
view
as
before
and
could
discover
dumbarton
rock
with
its
double
head
there
being
a
mist
over
it
it
had
a
appearance
as
i
observed
to
william
and
coleridge
something
like
the
tor
of
glastonbury
from
the
dorsetshire
hills
right
before
us
on
the
flat
island
mentioned
before
were
several
small
single
trees
or
shrubs
growing
at
different
distances
from
each
other
close
to
the
shore
but
some
optical
delusion
had
detached
them
from
the
land
on
which
they
stood
and
they
had
the
appearance
of
so
many
little
vessels
sailing
along
the
coast
of
it
i
mention
the
circumstance
because
with
the
ghostly
image
of
dumbarton
castle
and
the
ambiguous
ruin
on
the
small
island
it
was
much
in
the
character
of
the
scene
which
was
throughout
magical
and
enchanting
a
new
world
in
its
great
permanent
outline
and
composition
and
changing
at
every
moment
in
every
part
of
it
by
the
effect
of
sun
and
wind
and
mist
and
shower
and
cloud
and
the
blending
lights
and
deep
shades
which
took
the
place
of
each
other
traversing
the
lake
in
every
direction
the
whole
was
indeed
a
strange
mixture
of
soothing
and
restless
images
of
images
inviting
to
rest
and
others
hurrying
the
fancy
away
into
an
activity
still
more
pleasing
than
repose
yet
intricate
and
homeless
that
is
without
lasting
for
the
mind
as
the
prospect
was
there
was
no
perplexity
we
had
still
a
guide
to
lead
us
forward
wherever
we
looked
it
was
a
delightful
feeling
that
there
was
something
beyond
meanwhile
the
sense
of
quiet
was
never
lost
sight
of
the
little
peaceful
lakes
among
the
islands
might
make
you
forget
that
the
great
water
loch
lomond
was
so
near
and
yet
are
more
beautiful
because
you
know
that
it
is
so
they
have
their
own
bays
and
creeks
sheltered
within
a
shelter
when
we
had
ascended
to
the
top
of
the
island
we
had
a
view
up
to
ben
lomond
over
the
long
broad
water
without
spot
or
rock
and
looking
backwards
saw
the
islands
below
us
as
on
a
map
this
view
as
may
be
supposed
was
not
nearly
so
interesting
as
those
we
had
seen
before
we
hunted
out
all
the
houses
on
the
shore
which
were
very
few
there
was
the
village
of
luss
the
two
gentlemen
houses
our
favourite
cottages
and
here
and
there
a
hut
but
i
do
not
recollect
any
and
on
the
opposite
shore
not
a
single
dwelling
the
whole
scene
was
a
combination
of
natural
wildness
loveliness
beauty
and
barrenness
or
rather
bareness
yet
not
comfortless
or
cold
but
the
whole
was
beautiful
we
were
too
far
off
the
more
distant
shore
to
distinguish
any
particular
spots
which
we
might
have
regretted
were
not
better
cultivated
and
near
luss
there
was
no
want
of
houses
after
we
had
left
the
island
having
been
so
much
taken
with
the
beauty
of
the
bark
hut
and
the
little
lake
by
which
it
appeared
to
stand
we
desired
the
boatman
to
row
us
through
it
and
we
landed
at
the
hut
walked
upon
the
island
for
some
time
and
found
out
sheltered
places
for
cottages
there
were
several
woodmen
huts
which
with
some
scattered
and
others
in
irregular
knots
that
made
a
delicious
murmuring
in
the
wind
added
greatly
to
the
romantic
effect
of
the
scene
they
were
built
in
the
form
of
a
cone
from
the
ground
like
savages
huts
the
door
being
just
large
enough
for
a
man
to
enter
with
stooping
straw
beds
were
raised
on
logs
of
wood
tools
lying
about
and
a
forked
bough
of
a
tree
was
generally
suspended
from
the
roof
in
the
middle
to
hang
a
kettle
upon
it
was
a
place
that
might
have
been
just
visited
by
new
settlers
i
thought
of
ruth
and
her
dreams
of
romantic
love
and
then
he
said
how
sweet
it
were
a
fisher
or
a
hunter
there
a
gardener
in
the
shade
still
wandering
with
an
easy
mind
to
build
a
household
fire
and
find
a
home
in
every
glade
footnote

stanza
ed
we
found
the
main
lake
very
stormy
when
we
had
left
the
shelter
of
the
islands
and
there
was
again
a
threatening
of
rain
but
it
did
not
come
on
i
wanted
much
to
go
to
the
old
ruin
but
the
boatmen
were
in
a
hurry
to
be
at
home
they
told
us
it
had
been
a
stronghold
built
by
a
man
who
lived
there
alone
and
was
used
to
swim
over
and
make
depredations
on
the
shore
that
nobody
could
ever
lay
hands
on
him
he
was
such
a
good
swimmer
but
at
last
they
caught
him
in
a
net
the
men
pointed
out
to
us
an
island
belonging
to
sir
james
colquhoun
on
which
were
a
great
quantity
of
deer
arrived
at
the
inn
at
about
twelve
and
prepared
to
depart
immediately
we
should
have
gone
with
great
regret
if
the
weather
had
been
warmer
and
the
inn
more
comfortable
when
we
were
leaving
the
door
a
party
with
smart
carriage
and
servants
drove
up
and
i
observed
that
the
people
of
the
house
were
just
as
slow
in
their
attendance
upon
them
as
on
us
with
one
single
horse
and
outlandish
hibernian
vehicle
when
we
had
travelled
about
two
miles
the
lake
became
considerably
narrower
the
hills
rocky
covered
with
copses
or
bare
rising
more
immediately
from
the
bed
of
the
water
and
therefore
we
had
not
so
often
to
regret
the
want
of
inhabitants
passed
by
or
saw
at
a
distance
sometimes
a
single
cottage
or
two
or
three
together
but
the
whole
space
between
luss
and
tarbet
is
a
solitude
to
the
eye
we
were
reminded
of
ulswater
but
missed
the
pleasant
farms
and
the
mountains
were
not
so
interesting
we
had
not
seen
them
in
companies
or
brotherhoods
rising
one
above
another
at
a
long
distance
ben
lomond
stood
alone
opposite
to
us
majestically
overlooking
the
lake
yet
there
was
something
in
this
mountain
which
disappointed
me
a
want
of
massiveness
and
simplicity
perhaps
from
the
top
being
broken
into
three
distinct
stages
the
road
carried
us
over
a
bold
promontory
by
a
steep
and
high
ascent
and
we
had
a
long
view
of
the
lake
pushing
itself
up
in
a
narrow
line
through
an
avenue
of
mountains
terminated
by
the
mountains
at
the
head
of
the
lake
of
which
ben
lui
if
i
do
not
mistake
is
the
most
considerable
the
afternoon
was
showery
and
misty
therefore
we
did
not
see
this
prospect
so
distinctly
as
we
could
have
wished
but
there
was
a
grand
obscurity
over
it
which
might
make
the
mountains
appear
more
numerous
i
have
said
so
much
of
this
lake
that
i
am
tired
myself
and
i
fear
i
must
have
tired
my
friends
we
had
a
pleasant
journey
to
tarbet
more
than
half
of
it
on
foot
for
the
road
was
hilly
and
after
we
had
climbed
one
small
hill
we
were
not
desirous
to
get
into
the
car
again
seeing
another
before
us
and
our
path
was
always
delightful
near
the
lake
and
frequently
through
woods
when
we
were
within
about
half
a
mile
of
tarbet
at
a
sudden
turning
looking
to
the
left
we
saw
a
very
mountain
amongst
other
smooth
ones
the
rocks
on
the
summit
distinct
in
shape
as
if
they
were
buildings
raised
up
by
man
or
uncouth
images
of
some
strange
creature
we
called
out
with
one
voice
what
we
wanted
alluding
to
the
uniformity
of
the
of
the
lake
for
the
last
five
or
six
miles
as
we
conjectured
this
singular
mountain
was
the
famous
cobbler
near
arrochar
tarbet
was
before
us
in
the
recess
of
a
deep
large
bay
under
the
shelter
of
a
hill
when
we
came
up
to
the
village
we
had
to
inquire
for
the
inn
there
being
no
signboard
it
was
a
white
house
the
best
in
the
place
we
were
conducted
into
a
that
might
make
any
travellers
happy
a
square
room
with
windows
on
each
side
looking
one
way
towards
the
mountains
and
across
the
lake
to
ben
lomond
the
other
there
was
a
pretty
stone
house
before
towards
the
lake
some
huts
scattered
trees
two
or
three
green
fields
with
hedgerows
and
a
little
brook
making
its
way
towards
the
lake
the
fields
are
almost
flat
and
screened
on
that
side
nearest
the
head
of
the
lake
by
a
hill
which
pushing
itself
out
forms
the
bay
of
tarbet
and
towards
the
foot
by
a
gentle
slope
and
trees
the
lake
is
narrow
and
ben
lomond
shuts
up
the
prospect
rising
directly
from
the
water
we
could
have
believed
ourselves
to
be
by
the
side
of
ulswater
at
glenridden
or
in
some
other
of
the
inhabited
retirements
of
that
lake
we
were
in
a
sheltered
place
among
mountains
it
was
not
an
open
joyous
bay
with
a
cheerful
populous
village
like
luss
but
a
pastoral
and
retired
spot
with
a
few
single
dwellings
the
people
of
the
inn
stared
at
us
when
we
spoke
without
giving
us
an
answer
immediately
which
we
were
at
first
disposed
to
attribute
to
coarseness
of
manners
but
found
afterwards
that
they
did
not
understand
us
at
once
erse
being
the
language
spoken
in
the
family
nothing
but
salt
meat
and
eggs
for
dinner
no
potatoes
the
house
smelt
strongly
of
herrings
which
were
hung
to
dry
over
the
kitchen
fire
walked
in
the
evening
towards
the
head
of
the
lake
the
road
was
steep
over
the
hill
and
when
we
had
reached
the
top
of
it
we
had
long
views
up
and
down
the
water
passed
a
troop
of
women
who
were
resting
themselves
by
the
roadside
as
if
returning
from
their
day
labour
amongst
them
was
a
man
who
had
walked
with
us
a
considerable
way
in
the
morning
and
told
us
he
was
just
come
from
america
where
he
had
been
for
some
years
was
going
to
his
own
home
and
should
return
to
america
he
spoke
of
emigration
as
a
glorious
thing
for
them
who
had
money
poor
fellow
i
do
not
think
that
he
had
brought
much
back
with
him
for
he
had
worked
his
passage
over
i
much
suspected
that
a
bundle
which
he
carried
upon
a
stick
tied
in
a
contained
his
all
he
was
almost
blind
he
said
as
were
many
of
the
crew
he
intended
crossing
the
lake
at
the
ferry
but
it
was
stormy
and
he
thought
he
should
not
be
able
to
get
over
that
day
i
could
not
help
smiling
when
i
saw
him
lying
by
the
roadside
with
such
a
company
about
him
not
like
a
wayfaring
man
but
seeming
as
much
at
home
and
at
his
ease
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
out
of
his
hut
among
them
and
they
had
been
neighbours
all
their
lives
passed
one
pretty
house
a
large
thatched
dwelling
with
but
the
prospect
above
and
below
was
solitary
the
sun
had
long
been
set
before
we
returned
to
the
inn
as
travellers
we
were
glad
to
see
the
moon
over
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
but
it
was
a
cloudy
night
without
any
peculiar
beauty
or
solemnity
after
tea
we
made
inquiries
respecting
the
best
way
to
go
to
loch
ketterine
the
landlord
could
give
but
little
information
and
nobody
seemed
to
know
anything
distinctly
of
the
place
though
it
was
but
ten
miles
off
we
applied
to
the
who
waited
on
us
she
was
a
young
woman
dressed
in
a
white
her
hair
fastened
up
by
a
comb
and
without
shoes
and
stockings
when
we
asked
her
about
the
trossachs
she
could
give
us
no
information
but
on
our
saying
do
you
know
loch
ketterine
she
answered
with
a
smile
i
know
that
loch
for
i
was
bred
and
born
there
after
much
difficulty
we
learned
from
her
that
the
trossachs
were
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
and
that
by
the
way
we
were
to
go
we
should
come
upon
them
at
the
head
should
have
to
travel
ten
miles
to
the
foot
of
the
water
and
that
there
was
no
inn
by
the
way
the
girl
spoke
english
very
distinctly
but
she
had
few
words
and
found
it
difficult
to
understand
us
she
did
not
much
encourage
us
to
go
because
the
roads
were
bad
and
it
was
a
long
way
and
there
was
no
for
the
like
of
us
we
determined
however
to
venture
and
throw
ourselves
upon
the
hospitality
of
some
cottager
or
gentleman
we
desired
the
landlady
to
roast
us
a
couple
of
fowls
to
carry
with
us
there
are
always
plenty
of
fowls
at
the
doors
of
a
scotch
inn
and
eggs
are
as
regularly
brought
to
table
at
breakfast
as
bread
and
butter
footnote
this
distinction
between
the
foot
and
head
is
not
very
clear
what
is
meant
is
this
they
would
have
to
travel
the
whole
length
of
the
lake
from
the
west
to
the
east
end
of
it
before
they
came
to
the
trossachs
the
pass
leading
away
from
the
east
end
of
the
j
august
we
did
not
set
off
till
between
ten
and
eleven
much
too
late
for
a
long
day
journey
our
boatman
lived
at
the
pretty
white
house
which
we
saw
from
the
windows
we
called
at
his
door
by
the
way
and
even
when
we
were
near
the
house
the
outside
looked
comfortable
but
within
i
never
saw
anything
so
miserable
from
dirt
and
dirt
alone
it
reminded
one
of
the
house
of
a
decayed
weaver
in
the
suburbs
of
a
large
town
with
a
sickly
wife
and
a
large
family
but
william
says
it
was
far
worse
that
it
was
quite
hottentotish
after
long
waiting
and
many
clumsy
preparations
we
got
ourselves
seated
in
the
boat
but
we
had
not
floated
five
yards
before
we
perceived
that
if
any
of
the
party
and
there
was
a
little
highland
woman
who
was
going
over
the
water
with
us
the
boatman
his
helper
and
ourselves
should
stir
but
a
few
inches
leaning
to
one
side
or
the
other
the
boat
would
be
full
in
an
instant
and
we
at
the
bottom
besides
it
was
very
leaky
and
the
woman
was
employed
to
lade
out
the
water
continually
it
appeared
that
this
crazy
vessel
was
not
the
own
and
that
was
lying
in
a
bay
at
a
little
distance
he
said
he
would
take
us
to
it
as
fast
as
possible
but
i
was
so
much
frightened
i
would
gladly
have
given
up
the
whole
day
journey
indeed
not
one
of
us
would
have
attempted
to
cross
the
lake
in
that
boat
for
a
thousand
pounds
we
reached
the
larger
boat
in
safety
after
coasting
a
considerable
way
near
the
shore
but
just
as
we
were
landing
william
dropped
the
bundle
which
contained
our
food
into
the
water
the
fowls
were
no
worse
but
some
sugar
ground
coffee
and
seemed
to
be
entirely
spoiled
we
gathered
together
as
much
of
the
coffee
and
sugar
as
we
could
and
tied
it
up
and
again
trusted
ourselves
to
the
lake
the
sun
shone
and
the
air
was
calm
luckily
it
had
been
so
while
we
were
in
the
crazy
boat
we
had
rocks
and
woods
on
each
side
of
us
or
bare
hills
seldom
a
single
cottage
and
there
was
no
rememberable
place
till
we
came
opposite
to
a
waterfall
of
no
inconsiderable
size
that
appeared
to
drop
directly
into
the
lake
close
to
it
was
a
hut
which
we
were
told
was
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
was
a
pretty
farm
under
the
mountains
beside
a
river
the
cultivated
grounds
lying
all
together
and
sloping
towards
the
lake
from
the
mountain
hollow
down
which
the
river
came
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
how
beautiful
these
spots
appeared
after
moving
on
so
long
between
the
solitary
steeps
we
went
a
considerable
way
further
and
landed
at
rob
roy
caves
which
are
in
fact
no
caves
but
some
fine
rocks
on
the
brink
of
the
lake
in
the
crevices
of
which
a
man
might
hide
himself
cunningly
enough
the
water
is
very
deep
below
them
and
the
hills
above
steep
and
covered
with
wood
the
little
highland
woman
who
was
in
size
about
a
match
for
our
guide
at
lanerk
accompanied
us
hither
there
was
something
very
gracious
in
the
manners
of
this
woman
she
could
scarcely
speak
five
english
words
yet
she
gave
me
whenever
i
spoke
to
her
as
many
intelligible
smiles
as
i
had
needed
english
words
to
answer
me
and
helped
me
over
the
rocks
in
the
most
obliging
manner
she
had
left
the
boat
out
of
to
us
or
for
her
own
amusement
she
had
never
seen
these
caves
before
but
no
doubt
had
heard
of
them
the
tales
of
rob
roy
exploits
being
told
familiarly
round
the
ingles
hereabouts
for
this
neighbourhood
was
his
home
we
landed
at
inversneyde
the
by
the
waterfall
and
were
not
sorry
to
part
with
our
boatman
who
was
a
coarse
man
and
speaking
of
the
french
uttered
the
basest
and
most
cowardly
sentiments
his
helper
a
youth
fresh
from
the
isle
of
skye
was
innocent
of
this
fault
and
though
but
a
bad
rower
was
a
far
better
companion
he
could
not
speak
a
word
of
english
and
sang
a
plaintive
gaelic
air
in
a
low
tone
while
he
plied
his
oar
the
stood
on
the
bank
a
few
yards
above
the
where
the
boat
lies
it
is
a
small
hut
under
a
steep
wood
and
a
few
yards
to
the
right
looking
towards
the
hut
is
the
waterfall
the
fall
is
not
very
high
but
the
stream
is
considerable
as
we
could
see
by
the
large
black
stones
that
were
lying
bare
but
the
rains
if
they
had
reached
this
place
had
had
little
effect
upon
the
waterfall
its
noise
was
not
so
great
as
to
form
a
contrast
with
the
stillness
of
the
bay
into
which
it
falls
where
the
boat
and
house
and
waterfall
itself
seemed
all
sheltered
and
protected
the
highland
woman
was
to
go
with
us
the
two
first
miles
of
our
journey
she
led
us
along
a
bye
a
shorter
way
up
the
hill
from
the
there
is
a
considerable
settling
in
the
hills
that
border
loch
lomond
at
the
passage
by
which
we
were
to
cross
to
loch
ketterine
ben
lomond
terminating
near
the
is
on
the
same
side
of
the
water
with
it
and
about
three
miles
above
tarbet
we
had
to
climb
right
up
the
hill
which
is
very
steep
and
when
close
under
it
seemed
to
be
high
but
we
soon
reached
the
top
and
when
we
were
there
had
lost
sight
of
the
lake
and
now
our
road
was
over
a
moor
or
rather
through
a
wide
moorland
hollow
having
gone
a
little
way
we
saw
before
us
at
the
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
a
very
large
stone
building
a
singular
structure
with
a
high
wall
round
it
naked
hill
above
and
neither
field
nor
tree
near
but
the
moor
was
not
overgrown
with
heath
merely
but
grey
grass
such
as
cattle
might
pasture
upon
we
could
not
conjecture
what
this
building
was
it
appeared
as
if
it
had
been
built
strong
to
defend
it
from
storms
but
for
what
purpose
william
called
out
to
us
that
we
should
observe
that
place
well
for
it
was
exactly
like
one
of
the
spittals
of
the
alps
built
for
the
reception
of
travellers
and
indeed
i
had
thought
it
must
be
so
before
he
spoke
this
building
from
its
singular
structure
and
appearance
made
the
place
which
is
itself
in
a
country
like
scotland
nowise
remarkable
take
a
character
of
unusual
wildness
and
desolation
this
when
we
first
came
in
view
of
it
and
afterwards
when
we
had
passed
it
and
looked
back
three
pyramidal
mountains
on
the
opposite
side
of
loch
lomond
terminated
the
view
which
under
certain
accidents
of
weather
must
be
very
grand
our
highland
companion
had
not
english
enough
to
give
us
any
information
concerning
this
strange
building
we
could
only
get
from
her
that
it
was
a
large
house
which
was
plain
enough
we
walked
about
a
mile
and
a
half
over
the
moor
without
seeing
any
other
dwelling
but
one
hut
by
the
with
a
and
a
enclosure
for
potatoes
then
we
came
to
several
clusters
of
houses
even
hamlets
they
might
be
called
but
where
there
is
any
land
belonging
to
the
highland
huts
there
are
so
many
near
which
differ
in
no
respect
from
the
except
that
they
send
out
no
smoke
that
one
house
looks
like
two
or
three
near
these
houses
was
a
considerable
quantity
of
cultivated
ground
potatoes
and
corn
and
the
people
were
busy
making
hay
in
the
hollow
places
of
the
open
vale
and
all
along
the
sides
of
the
becks
it
was
a
pretty
sight
altogether
men
and
women
dogs
the
little
running
streams
with
linen
bleaching
near
them
and
cheerful
sunny
hills
and
rocks
on
every
side
we
passed
by
one
patch
of
potatoes
that
a
florist
might
have
been
proud
of
no
ever
looked
more
gay
than
this
square
plot
of
ground
on
the
waste
common
the
flowers
were
in
very
large
bunches
and
of
an
extraordinary
size
and
of
every
conceivable
shade
of
colouring
from
to
deep
purple
it
was
pleasing
in
that
place
where
perhaps
was
never
yet
a
flower
cultivated
by
man
for
his
own
pleasure
to
see
these
blossoms
grow
more
gladly
than
elsewhere
making
a
summer
garden
near
the
mountain
dwellings
at
one
of
the
clusters
of
houses
we
parted
with
our
companion
who
had
insisted
on
bearing
my
bundle
while
she
stayed
with
us
i
often
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
with
her
and
seeing
a
small
tarn
before
us
was
reminded
of
the
pleasure
of
fishing
and
the
manner
of
living
there
and
asked
her
what
sort
of
food
was
eaten
in
that
place
if
they
lived
much
upon
fish
or
had
mutton
from
the
hills
she
looked
earnestly
at
me
and
shaking
her
head
replied
oh
yes
eat
fish
no
papists
eat
everything
the
tarn
had
one
small
island
covered
with
wood
the
stream
that
runs
from
it
falls
into
loch
ketterine
which
after
we
had
gone
a
little
beyond
the
tarn
we
saw
at
some
distance
before
us
pursued
the
road
a
mountain
till
we
came
to
a
corner
of
what
seemed
the
head
of
the
lake
and
there
sate
down
completely
tired
and
hopeless
as
to
the
rest
of
our
journey
the
road
ended
at
the
shore
and
no
houses
were
to
be
seen
on
the
opposite
side
except
a
few
widely
parted
huts
and
on
the
near
side
was
a
trackless
heath
the
land
at
the
head
of
the
lake
was
but
a
continuation
of
the
common
we
had
come
along
and
was
covered
with
heather
intersected
by
a
few
straggling
coleridge
and
i
were
faint
with
hunger
and
could
go
no
further
till
we
had
refreshed
ourselves
so
we
ate
up
one
of
our
fowls
and
drank
of
the
water
of
loch
ketterine
but
william
could
not
be
easy
till
he
had
examined
the
coast
so
he
left
us
and
made
his
way
along
the
moor
across
the
head
of
the
lake
coleridge
and
i
as
we
sate
had
what
seemed
to
us
but
a
dreary
prospect
a
waste
of
unknown
ground
which
we
guessed
we
must
travel
over
before
it
was
possible
for
us
to
find
a
shelter
we
saw
a
long
way
down
the
lake
it
was
all
moor
on
the
near
side
on
the
other
the
hills
were
steep
from
the
water
and
there
were
large
but
no
cheerful
green
fields
and
no
road
that
we
could
see
we
knew
however
that
there
must
be
a
road
from
house
to
house
but
the
whole
lake
appeared
a
solitude
neither
boats
islands
nor
houses
no
grandeur
in
the
hills
nor
any
loveliness
in
the
shores
when
we
first
came
in
view
of
it
we
had
said
it
was
like
a
barren
ulswater
ulswater
dismantled
of
its
grandeur
and
cropped
of
its
lesser
beauties
when
i
had
swallowed
my
dinner
i
hastened
after
william
and
coleridge
followed
me
walked
through
the
heather
with
some
labour
for
perhaps
half
a
mile
and
found
william
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
small
eminence
whence
we
saw
the
real
head
of
the
lake
which
was
pushed
up
into
the
vale
a
considerable
way
beyond
the
promontory
where
we
now
sate
the
view
up
the
lake
was
very
pleasing
resembling
thirlemere
below
armath
there
were
rocky
promontories
and
woody
islands
and
what
was
most
cheering
to
us
a
neat
white
house
on
the
opposite
shore
but
we
could
see
no
boats
so
in
order
to
get
to
it
we
should
be
obliged
to
go
round
the
head
of
the
lake
a
long
and
weary
way
after
coleridge
came
up
to
us
while
we
were
debating
whether
we
should
turn
back
or
go
forward
we
espied
a
man
on
horseback
at
a
little
distance
with
a
boy
following
him
on
foot
no
doubt
a
welcome
sight
and
we
hailed
him
we
should
have
been
glad
to
have
seen
either
man
woman
or
child
at
this
time
but
there
was
something
uncommon
and
interesting
in
this
man
appearance
which
would
have
fixed
our
attention
wherever
we
had
met
him
he
was
a
complete
highlander
in
dress
figure
and
face
and
a
very
man
hardy
and
vigorous
though
past
his
prime
while
he
stood
waiting
for
us
in
his
bonnet
and
plaid
which
never
look
more
graceful
than
on
horseback
i
forgot
our
errand
and
only
felt
glad
that
we
were
in
the
highlands
william
accosted
him
with
sir
do
you
speak
english
he
replied
a
little
he
spoke
however
sufficiently
well
for
our
purpose
and
very
distinctly
as
all
the
highlanders
do
who
learn
english
as
a
foreign
language
but
in
a
long
conversation
they
want
words
he
informed
us
that
he
himself
was
going
beyond
the
trossachs
to
callander
that
no
boats
were
kept
to
let
but
there
were
two
gentlemen
houses
at
this
end
of
the
lake
one
of
which
we
could
not
yet
see
it
being
hidden
from
us
by
a
part
of
the
hill
on
which
we
stood
the
other
house
was
that
which
we
saw
opposite
to
us
both
the
gentlemen
kept
boats
and
probably
might
be
able
to
spare
one
of
their
servants
to
go
with
us
after
we
had
asked
many
questions
which
the
highlander
answered
with
patience
and
courtesy
he
parted
from
us
going
along
a
sort
of
which
a
if
he
once
get
into
it
need
not
lose
if
he
be
careful
when
he
was
gone
we
again
debated
whether
we
should
go
back
to
tarbet
or
throw
ourselves
upon
the
mercy
of
one
of
the
two
gentlemen
for
a
night
lodging
what
we
had
seen
of
the
main
body
of
the
lake
made
us
little
desire
to
see
more
of
it
the
highlander
upon
the
naked
heath
in
his
highland
dress
upon
his
horse
with
the
boy
following
him
was
worth
it
all
but
after
a
little
while
we
resolved
to
go
on
ashamed
to
shrink
from
an
adventure
pursued
the
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
other
gentleman
house
which
stood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
vale
a
little
above
the
lake
it
was
a
white
house
no
trees
near
it
except
a
new
plantation
of
firs
but
the
fields
were
green
sprinkled
over
with
and
the
brook
which
comes
down
the
valley
and
falls
into
the
lake
ran
through
them
it
was
like
a
farm
in
a
mountain
vale
and
yet
very
pleasing
after
the
depressing
prospect
which
had
been
before
us
our
road
was
rough
and
not
easy
to
be
kept
it
was
between
five
and
six
when
we
reached
the
brook
side
where
coleridge
and
i
stopped
and
william
went
up
towards
the
house
which
was
in
a
field
where
about
half
a
dozen
people
were
at
work
he
addressed
himself
to
one
who
appeared
like
the
master
and
all
drew
near
him
staring
at
william
as
nobody
could
have
stared
but
out
of
sheer
rudeness
except
in
such
a
lonely
place
he
told
his
tale
and
inquired
about
boats
there
were
no
boats
and
no
lodging
nearer
than
callander
ten
miles
beyond
the
foot
of
the
lake
a
laugh
was
on
every
face
when
william
said
we
were
come
to
see
the
trossachs
no
doubt
they
thought
we
had
better
have
stayed
at
our
own
homes
william
endeavoured
to
make
it
appear
not
so
very
foolish
by
informing
them
that
it
was
a
place
much
celebrated
in
england
though
perhaps
little
thought
of
by
them
and
that
we
only
differed
from
many
of
our
countrymen
in
having
come
the
wrong
way
in
consequence
of
an
erroneous
direction
after
a
little
time
the
gentleman
said
we
should
be
accommodated
with
such
beds
as
they
had
and
should
be
welcome
to
rest
in
their
house
if
we
pleased
william
came
back
for
coleridge
and
me
the
men
all
stood
at
the
door
to
receive
us
and
now
their
behaviour
was
perfectly
courteous
we
were
conducted
into
the
house
by
the
same
man
who
had
directed
us
hither
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
afterwards
we
learned
that
he
was
the
father
of
our
hostess
he
showed
us
into
a
room
begged
we
would
sit
at
our
ease
walk
out
or
do
just
as
we
pleased
it
was
a
large
square
deal
wainscoted
room
the
wainscot
black
with
age
yet
had
never
been
painted
it
did
not
look
like
an
english
room
and
yet
i
do
not
know
in
what
it
differed
except
that
in
england
it
is
not
common
to
see
so
large
and
a
room
so
there
were
two
or
three
large
tables
and
a
few
old
chairs
of
different
sorts
as
if
they
had
been
picked
up
one
did
not
know
how
at
sales
or
had
belonged
to
different
rooms
of
the
house
ever
since
it
was
built
we
sat
perhaps
of
an
hour
and
i
was
about
to
carry
down
our
wet
coffee
and
sugar
and
ask
leave
to
boil
it
when
the
mistress
of
the
house
entered
a
tall
woman
neatly
dressed
in
a
gown
with
a
white
handkerchief
tied
round
her
head
she
spoke
to
us
in
a
very
pleasing
manner
begging
permission
to
make
tea
for
us
an
offer
which
we
thankfully
accepted
encouraged
by
the
sweetness
of
her
manners
i
went
to
dry
my
feet
by
the
kitchen
fire
she
lent
me
a
pair
of
stockings
and
behaved
to
me
with
the
utmost
attention
and
kindness
she
carried
the
into
the
room
herself
leaving
me
to
make
tea
and
set
before
us
cheese
and
butter
and
barley
cakes
these
cakes
are
as
thin
as
our
but
instead
of
being
crisp
are
soft
and
leathery
yet
we
being
hungry
and
the
butter
delicious
ate
them
with
great
pleasure
but
when
the
same
bread
was
set
before
us
afterwards
we
did
not
like
it
after
tea
william
and
i
walked
out
we
amused
ourselves
with
watching
the
highlanders
at
work
they
went
leisurely
about
everything
and
whatever
was
to
be
done
all
followed
old
men
and
young
and
little
children
we
were
driven
into
the
house
by
a
shower
which
came
on
with
the
evening
darkness
and
the
people
leaving
their
work
paused
at
the
same
time
i
was
pleased
to
see
them
a
while
after
sitting
round
a
blazing
fire
in
the
kitchen
father
and
master
and
man
and
the
mother
with
her
little
child
on
her
knee
when
i
had
been
there
before
tea
i
had
observed
what
a
contrast
there
was
between
the
mistress
and
her
kitchen
she
did
not
differ
in
appearance
from
an
english
country
lady
but
her
kitchen
roof
walls
and
floor
of
mud
was
all
black
alike
yet
now
with
the
light
of
a
bright
fire
upon
so
many
happy
countenances
the
whole
room
made
a
pretty
sight
we
heard
the
company
laughing
and
talking
long
after
we
were
in
bed
indeed
i
believe
they
never
work
till
they
are
tired
the
children
could
not
speak
a
word
of
english
they
were
very
shy
at
first
but
after
i
had
caressed
the
eldest
and
given
her
a
red
leather
purse
with
which
she
was
delighted
she
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
hung
about
me
changing
her
looks
for
pretty
smiles
her
mother
lamented
they
were
so
far
from
school
they
should
be
obliged
to
send
the
children
down
into
the
lowlands
to
be
taught
reading
and
english
callander
the
nearest
town
was
twenty
miles
from
them
and
it
was
only
a
small
place
they
had
their
groceries
from
glasgow
she
said
that
at
callander
was
their
nearest
church
but
sometimes
got
a
preaching
at
the
garrison
in
explaining
herself
she
informed
us
that
the
large
building
which
had
puzzled
us
in
the
morning
had
been
built
by
government
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
dukes
of
montrose
for
the
defence
of
his
domains
against
the
attacks
of
rob
roy
i
will
not
answer
for
the
truth
of
this
perhaps
it
might
have
been
built
for
this
purpose
and
as
a
check
on
the
highlands
in
general
certain
it
is
however
that
it
was
a
garrison
soldiers
used
to
be
constantly
stationed
there
and
have
only
been
withdrawn
within
the
last
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
macfarlane
attended
me
to
my
room
she
said
she
hoped
i
should
be
able
to
sleep
upon
blankets
and
said
they
were
fresh
from
the
fauld
footnote
she
means
that
they
stop
work
before
they
are
ed
august
before
i
rose
macfarlane
came
into
my
room
to
see
if
i
wanted
anything
and
told
me
she
should
send
the
servant
up
with
a
basin
of
whey
saying
we
make
very
good
whey
in
this
country
indeed
i
thought
it
the
best
i
had
ever
tasted
but
i
can
not
tell
how
this
should
be
for
they
only
make
cheeses
i
asked
her
for
a
little
bread
and
milk
for
our
breakfast
but
she
said
it
would
be
no
trouble
to
make
tea
as
she
must
make
it
for
the
family
so
we
all
breakfasted
together
the
cheese
was
set
out
as
before
with
plenty
of
butter
and
and
fresh
baked
oaten
cakes
which
no
doubt
were
made
for
us
they
had
been
kneaded
with
cream
and
were
excellent
all
the
party
pressed
us
to
eat
and
were
very
jocose
about
the
necessity
of
helping
out
their
coarse
bread
with
butter
and
they
themselves
ate
almost
as
much
butter
as
bread
in
talking
of
the
french
and
the
present
times
their
language
was
what
most
people
would
call
jacobinical
they
spoke
much
of
the
oppressions
endured
by
the
highlanders
further
up
of
the
absolute
impossibility
of
their
living
in
any
comfort
and
of
the
cruelty
of
laying
so
many
restraints
on
emigration
then
they
spoke
with
animation
of
the
attachment
of
the
clans
to
their
lairds
the
laird
of
this
place
glengyle
where
we
live
could
have
commanded
so
many
men
who
would
have
followed
him
to
the
death
and
now
there
are
none
left
it
appeared
that
macfarlane
and
his
wife
brother
macalpine
farmed
the
place
inclusive
of
the
whole
vale
upwards
to
the
mountains
and
the
mountains
themselves
under
the
lady
of
glengyle
the
mother
of
the
young
laird
a
minor
it
was
a
speaking
of
another
neighbouring
laird
they
said
he
had
gone
like
the
rest
of
them
to
edinburgh
left
his
lands
and
his
own
people
spending
his
money
where
it
brought
him
not
any
esteem
so
that
he
was
of
no
value
either
at
home
or
abroad
we
mentioned
rob
roy
and
the
eyes
of
all
glistened
even
the
lady
of
the
house
who
was
very
diffident
and
no
great
talker
exclaimed
he
was
a
good
man
rob
roy
he
had
been
dead
only
about
eighty
years
had
lived
in
the
next
farm
which
belonged
to
him
and
there
his
bones
were
laid
he
was
a
famous
swordsman
having
an
arm
much
longer
than
other
men
he
had
a
greater
command
with
his
sword
as
a
proof
of
the
length
of
his
arm
they
told
us
that
he
could
garter
his
tartan
stockings
below
the
knee
without
stooping
and
added
a
dozen
different
stories
of
single
combats
which
he
had
fought
all
in
perfect
merely
to
prove
his
prowess
i
daresay
they
had
stories
of
this
kind
which
would
hardly
have
been
exhausted
in
the
long
evenings
of
a
whole
december
week
rob
roy
being
as
famous
here
as
ever
robin
hood
was
in
the
forest
of
sherwood
also
robbed
from
the
rich
giving
to
the
poor
and
defending
them
from
oppression
they
tell
of
his
confining
the
factor
of
the
duke
of
montrose
in
one
of
the
islands
of
loch
ketterine
after
having
taken
his
money
from
him
the
duke
rents
in
open
day
while
they
were
sitting
at
table
he
was
a
formidable
enemy
of
the
duke
but
being
a
small
laird
against
a
greater
was
overcome
at
last
and
forced
to
resign
all
his
lands
on
the
braes
of
loch
lomond
including
the
caves
which
we
visited
on
account
of
the
money
he
had
taken
from
the
duke
and
could
not
repay
footnote
there
is
a
mistake
here
his
bones
were
laid
about
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
from
thence
in
balquhidder
kirkyard
but
it
was
under
the
belief
that
his
grave
is
near
the
head
of
loch
ketterine
in
one
of
those
burial
grounds
of
neglected
and
desolate
appearance
which
the
traveller
meets
with
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
that
the
poem
on
roy
was
j
when
breakfast
was
ended
the
mistress
desired
the
person
whom
we
took
to
be
her
husband
to
return
thanks
he
said
a
short
grace
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
all
went
off
to
their
work
we
saw
them
about
the
door
following
one
another
like
a
flock
of
sheep
with
the
children
after
whatever
job
they
were
engaged
in
macfarlane
told
me
she
would
show
me
the
of
the
lairds
of
glengyle
and
took
me
to
a
square
enclosure
like
a
pinfold
with
a
stone
ball
at
every
corner
we
had
noticed
it
the
evening
before
and
wondered
what
it
could
be
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
planting
as
they
call
plantations
which
was
enclosed
for
the
preservation
of
the
trees
therefore
we
had
to
climb
over
a
high
wall
it
was
a
dismal
spot
containing
four
or
five
graves
overgrown
with
long
grass
nettles
and
brambles
against
the
wall
was
a
marble
monument
to
the
memory
of
one
of
the
lairds
of
whom
they
spoke
with
veneration
some
english
verses
were
inscribed
upon
the
marble
purporting
that
he
had
been
the
father
of
his
clan
a
brave
and
good
man
when
we
returned
to
the
house
she
said
she
would
show
me
what
curious
feathers
they
had
in
their
country
and
brought
out
a
bunch
carefully
wrapped
up
in
paper
on
my
asking
her
what
bird
they
came
from
oh
she
replied
it
is
a
great
beast
we
conjectured
it
was
an
eagle
and
from
her
description
of
its
ways
and
the
manner
of
destroying
it
we
knew
it
was
so
she
begged
me
to
accept
of
some
of
the
feathers
telling
me
that
some
ladies
wore
them
in
their
heads
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
gift
which
i
shall
preserve
in
memory
of
her
kindness
and
simplicity
of
manners
and
the
highland
solitude
where
she
lived
we
took
leave
of
the
family
with
regret
they
were
handsome
healthy
and
people
it
was
ten
when
we
departed
we
had
learned
that
there
was
a
kept
at
three
miles
distance
and
if
the
man
was
at
home
he
would
row
us
down
the
lake
to
the
trossachs
our
walk
was
mostly
through
along
a
upon
which
narrow
carts
might
travel
passed
that
white
house
which
had
looked
at
us
with
such
a
friendly
face
when
we
were
on
the
other
side
it
stood
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
with
green
pastures
below
it
plots
of
corn
and
and
behind
a
rocky
steep
covered
with
wood
it
was
a
very
pretty
place
but
the
morning
being
cold
and
dull
the
opposite
shore
appeared
dreary
near
to
the
white
house
we
passed
by
another
of
those
little
pinfold
squares
which
we
knew
to
be
a
it
was
in
a
sloping
green
field
among
woods
and
within
sound
of
the
beating
of
the
water
against
the
shore
if
there
were
but
a
gentle
breeze
to
stir
it
i
thought
if
i
lived
in
that
house
and
my
ancestors
and
kindred
were
buried
there
i
should
sit
many
an
hour
under
the
walls
of
this
plot
of
earth
where
all
the
household
would
be
gathered
together
we
found
the
ferryman
at
work
in
the
field
above
his
hut
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
go
with
us
but
being
wet
and
hungry
we
begged
that
he
would
let
us
sit
by
his
fire
till
we
had
refreshed
ourselves
this
was
the
first
genuine
highland
hut
we
had
been
in
we
entered
by
the
the
being
within
at
right
angles
to
the
outer
door
the
woman
was
distressed
that
she
had
a
bad
fire
but
she
heaped
up
some
dry
peats
and
heather
and
blowing
it
with
her
breath
in
a
short
time
raised
a
blaze
that
scorched
us
into
comfortable
feelings
a
small
part
of
the
smoke
found
its
way
out
of
the
hole
of
the
chimney
the
rest
through
the
open
one
of
which
was
within
the
recess
of
the
fireplace
and
made
a
frame
to
a
little
picture
of
the
restless
lake
and
the
opposite
shore
seen
when
the
outer
door
was
open
the
woman
of
the
house
was
very
kind
whenever
we
asked
her
for
anything
it
seemed
a
fresh
pleasure
to
her
that
she
had
it
for
us
she
always
answered
with
a
sort
of
softening
down
of
the
scotch
exclamation
hoot
ho
yes
ye
get
that
and
hied
to
her
cupboard
in
the
spence
we
were
amused
with
the
phrase
ye
get
that
in
the
highlands
which
appeared
to
us
as
if
it
came
from
a
perpetual
feeling
of
the
difficulty
with
which
most
things
are
procured
we
got
oatmeal
butter
bread
and
milk
made
some
porridge
and
then
departed
it
was
rainy
and
cold
with
a
strong
wind
coleridge
was
afraid
of
the
cold
in
the
boat
so
he
determined
to
walk
down
the
lake
pursuing
the
same
road
we
had
come
along
there
was
nothing
very
interesting
for
the
first
three
or
four
miles
on
either
side
of
the
water
to
the
right
uncultivated
heath
or
poor
and
to
the
left
a
scattering
of
meadow
ground
patches
of
corn
and
here
and
there
a
cottage
the
wind
fell
and
it
began
to
rain
heavily
on
this
william
wrapped
himself
in
the
plaid
and
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
till
we
came
to
a
place
where
i
could
not
help
rousing
him
we
were
rowing
down
that
side
of
the
lake
which
had
hitherto
been
little
else
than
a
moorish
ridge
after
turning
a
rocky
point
we
came
to
a
bay
closed
in
by
rocks
and
steep
woods
chiefly
of
birch
the
lake
was
elsewhere
ruffled
but
at
the
entrance
of
this
bay
the
breezes
sunk
and
it
was
calm
a
small
island
was
near
and
the
opposite
shore
covered
with
wood
looked
soft
through
the
misty
rain
william
rubbing
his
eyes
for
he
had
been
asleep
called
out
that
he
hoped
i
had
not
let
him
pass
by
anything
that
was
so
beautiful
as
this
and
i
was
glad
to
tell
him
that
it
was
but
the
beginning
of
a
new
land
after
we
had
left
this
bay
we
saw
before
us
a
long
reach
of
woods
and
rocks
and
rocky
points
that
promised
other
bays
more
beautiful
than
what
we
had
passed
the
ferryman
was
a
fellow
and
rowed
very
industriously
following
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
shore
he
was
delighted
with
the
pleasure
we
expressed
continually
repeating
how
pleasant
it
would
have
been
on
a
fine
day
i
believe
he
was
attached
to
the
lake
by
some
sentiment
of
pride
as
his
own
domain
his
being
almost
the
only
boat
upon
it
which
made
him
seeing
we
were
willing
gazers
take
far
more
pains
than
an
ordinary
boatman
he
would
often
say
after
he
had
compassed
the
turning
of
a
point
this
is
a
bonny
part
and
he
always
chose
the
bonniest
with
greater
skill
than
our
and
picturesque
travellers
places
screened
from
the
winds
that
was
the
first
point
the
rest
followed
of
course
richer
growing
trees
rocks
and
banks
and
curves
which
the
eye
delights
in
the
second
bay
we
came
to
differed
from
the
rest
the
hills
retired
a
short
space
from
the
lake
leaving
a
few
level
fields
between
on
which
was
a
cottage
embosomed
in
trees
the
bay
was
defended
by
rocks
at
each
end
and
the
hills
behind
made
a
shelter
for
the
cottage
the
only
dwelling
i
believe
except
one
on
this
side
of
loch
ketterine
we
now
came
to
steeps
that
rose
directly
from
the
lake
and
passed
by
a
place
called
in
the
gaelic
the
den
of
the
ghosts
which
reminded
us
of
lodore
it
is
a
rock
or
mass
of
rock
with
a
stream
of
large
black
stones
like
the
naked
or
bed
of
a
torrent
down
the
side
of
it
start
out
of
the
rock
in
every
direction
and
cover
the
hill
above
further
than
we
could
see
the
water
of
the
lake
below
was
very
deep
black
and
calm
our
delight
increased
as
we
advanced
till
we
came
in
view
of
the
termination
of
the
lake
seeing
where
the
river
issues
out
of
it
through
a
narrow
chasm
between
the
hills
footnote
goblins
j
here
i
ought
to
rest
as
we
rested
and
attempt
to
give
utterance
to
our
pleasure
but
indeed
i
can
impart
but
little
of
what
we
felt
we
were
still
on
the
same
side
of
the
water
and
being
immediately
under
the
hill
within
a
considerable
bending
of
the
shore
we
were
enclosed
by
hills
all
round
as
if
we
had
been
upon
a
smaller
lake
of
which
the
whole
was
visible
it
was
an
entire
solitude
and
all
that
we
beheld
was
the
perfection
of
loveliness
and
beauty
we
had
been
through
many
solitary
places
since
we
came
into
scotland
but
this
place
differed
as
much
from
any
we
had
seen
before
as
if
there
had
been
nothing
in
common
between
them
no
thought
of
dreariness
or
desolation
found
entrance
here
yet
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
water
wood
rocks
and
heather
and
bare
mountains
above
we
saw
the
mountains
by
glimpses
as
the
clouds
passed
by
them
and
were
not
disposed
to
regret
with
our
boatman
that
it
was
not
a
fine
day
for
the
near
objects
were
not
concealed
from
us
but
softened
by
being
seen
through
the
mists
the
lake
is
not
very
wide
here
but
appeared
to
be
much
narrower
than
it
really
is
owing
to
the
many
promontories
which
are
pushed
so
far
into
it
that
they
are
much
more
like
islands
than
promontories
we
had
a
longing
desire
to
row
to
the
outlet
and
look
up
into
the
narrow
passage
through
which
the
river
went
but
the
point
where
we
were
to
land
was
on
the
other
side
so
we
bent
our
course
right
across
and
just
as
we
came
in
sight
of
two
huts
which
have
been
built
by
lady
perth
as
a
shelter
for
those
who
visit
the
trossachs
coleridge
hailed
us
with
a
shout
of
triumph
from
the
door
of
one
of
them
exulting
in
the
glory
of
scotland
the
huts
stand
at
a
small
distance
from
each
other
on
a
high
and
perpendicular
rock
that
rises
from
the
bed
of
the
lake
a
road
which
has
a
very
wild
appearance
has
been
cut
through
the
rock
yet
even
here
among
these
bold
precipices
the
feeling
of
excessive
beautifulness
overcomes
every
other
while
we
were
upon
the
lake
on
every
side
of
us
were
bays
within
bays
often
more
like
tiny
lakes
or
pools
than
bays
and
these
not
in
long
succession
only
but
all
round
some
almost
on
the
broad
breast
of
the
water
the
promontories
shot
out
so
far
after
we
had
landed
we
walked
along
the
road
to
the
uppermost
of
the
huts
where
coleridge
was
standing
from
the
door
of
this
hut
we
saw
benvenue
opposite
to
us
a
high
mountain
but
clouds
concealed
its
top
its
side
rising
directly
from
the
lake
is
covered
with
to
a
great
height
and
seamed
with
innumerable
channels
of
torrents
but
now
there
was
no
water
in
them
nothing
to
break
in
upon
the
stillness
and
repose
of
the
scene
nor
do
i
recollect
hearing
the
sound
of
water
from
any
side
the
wind
being
fallen
and
the
lake
perfectly
still
the
place
was
all
eye
and
completely
satisfied
the
sense
and
the
heart
above
and
below
us
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
were
rocks
knolls
and
hills
which
wherever
anything
could
grow
and
that
was
everywhere
between
the
rocks
were
covered
with
trees
and
heather
the
trees
did
not
in
any
place
grow
so
thick
as
an
ordinary
wood
yet
i
think
there
was
never
a
bare
space
of
twenty
yards
it
was
more
like
a
natural
forest
where
the
trees
grow
in
groups
or
singly
not
hiding
the
surface
of
the
ground
which
instead
of
being
green
and
mossy
was
of
the
richest
purple
the
heather
was
indeed
the
most
luxuriant
i
ever
saw
it
was
so
tall
that
a
child
of
ten
years
old
struggling
through
it
would
often
have
been
buried
head
and
shoulders
and
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
colour
near
or
at
a
distance
seen
under
the
trees
is
not
to
be
conceived
but
if
i
were
to
go
on
describing
for
evermore
i
should
give
but
a
faint
and
very
often
a
false
idea
of
the
different
objects
and
the
various
combinations
of
them
in
this
most
intricate
and
delicious
place
besides
i
tired
myself
out
with
describing
at
loch
lomond
so
i
will
hasten
to
the
end
of
my
tale
this
reminds
me
of
a
sentence
in
a
little
pamphlet
written
by
the
minister
of
callander
descriptive
of
the
environs
of
that
place
after
having
taken
up
at
least
six
pages
with
the
trossachs
he
concludes
thus
in
a
word
the
trossachs
beggar
all
description
a
conclusion
in
which
everybody
who
has
been
there
will
agree
with
him
i
believe
the
word
trossachs
signifies
many
hills
it
is
a
name
given
to
all
the
eminences
at
the
foot
of
loch
ketterine
and
about
half
a
mile
beyond
we
left
the
hut
retracing
the
few
yards
of
road
which
we
had
climbed
our
boat
lay
at
anchor
under
the
rock
in
the
last
of
all
the
compartments
of
the
lake
a
small
oblong
pool
almost
shut
up
within
itself
as
several
others
had
appeared
to
be
by
jutting
points
of
rock
the
termination
of
a
long
of
the
water
pushed
up
between
the
steps
of
the
main
shore
where
the
huts
stand
and
a
broad
promontory
which
with
its
hillocks
and
points
and
lesser
promontories
occupies
the
centre
of
the
foot
of
the
lake
a
person
sailing
through
the
lake
up
the
middle
of
it
would
just
as
naturally
suppose
that
the
outlet
was
here
as
on
the
other
side
and
so
it
might
have
been
with
the
most
trifling
change
in
the
disposition
of
the
ground
for
at
the
end
of
this
slip
of
water
the
lake
is
confined
only
by
a
gentle
rising
of
a
few
yards
towards
an
opening
between
the
hills
a
narrow
pass
or
valley
through
which
the
river
might
have
flowed
the
road
is
carried
through
this
valley
which
only
differs
from
the
lower
part
of
the
vale
of
the
lake
in
being
excessively
narrow
and
without
water
it
is
enclosed
by
mountains
rocky
mounds
hills
and
hillocks
scattered
over
with
and
covered
with
dutch
myrtle
and
heather
even
surpassing
what
we
had
seen
before
our
mother
eve
had
no
fairer
though
a
more
diversified
garden
to
tend
than
we
found
within
this
little
close
valley
it
rained
all
the
time
but
the
mists
and
calm
air
made
us
ample
amends
for
a
wetting
at
the
opening
of
the
pass
we
climbed
up
a
low
eminence
and
had
an
unexpected
prospect
suddenly
before
us
another
lake
small
compared
with
loch
ketterine
though
perhaps
four
miles
long
but
the
misty
air
concealed
the
end
of
it
the
transition
from
the
solitary
wildness
of
loch
ketterine
and
the
narrow
valley
or
pass
to
this
scene
was
very
delightful
it
was
a
gentle
place
with
lovely
open
bays
one
small
island
corn
fields
woods
and
a
group
of
cottages
this
vale
seemed
to
have
been
made
to
be
tributary
to
the
comforts
of
man
loch
ketterine
for
the
lonely
delight
of
nature
and
kind
spirits
delighting
in
beauty
the
sky
was
grey
and
heavy
floating
mists
on
the
which
softened
the
objects
and
where
we
lost
sight
of
the
lake
it
appeared
so
near
to
the
sky
that
they
almost
touched
one
another
giving
a
visionary
beauty
to
the
prospect
while
we
overlooked
this
quiet
scene
we
could
hear
the
stream
rumbling
among
the
rocks
between
the
lakes
but
the
mists
concealed
any
glimpse
of
it
which
we
might
have
had
this
small
lake
is
called
loch
achray
we
returned
of
course
by
the
same
road
our
guide
repeated
over
and
over
again
his
lamentations
that
the
day
was
so
bad
though
we
had
often
told
him
not
indeed
with
much
hope
that
he
would
believe
us
that
we
were
glad
of
it
as
we
walked
along
he
pulled
a
leafy
twig
from
a
and
after
smelling
it
gave
it
to
me
saying
how
sweet
and
halesome
it
was
and
that
it
was
pleasant
and
very
halesome
on
a
fine
summer
morning
to
sail
under
the
banks
where
the
birks
are
growing
this
reminded
me
of
the
old
scotch
songs
in
which
you
continually
hear
of
the
the
birks
common
as
birches
are
in
the
north
of
england
i
believe
their
sweet
smell
is
a
thing
unnoticed
among
the
peasants
we
returned
again
to
the
huts
to
take
a
farewell
look
we
had
shared
our
food
with
the
ferryman
and
a
traveller
whom
we
had
met
here
who
was
going
up
the
lake
and
wished
to
lodge
at
the
so
we
offered
him
a
place
in
the
boat
coleridge
chose
to
walk
we
took
the
same
side
of
the
lake
as
before
and
had
much
delight
in
visiting
the
bays
over
again
but
the
evening
began
to
darken
and
it
rained
so
heavily
before
we
had
gone
two
miles
that
we
were
completely
wet
it
was
dark
when
we
landed
and
on
entering
the
house
i
was
sick
with
cold
the
good
woman
had
provided
according
to
her
promise
a
better
fire
than
we
had
found
in
the
morning
and
indeed
when
i
sate
down
in
the
of
her
smoky
biggin
i
thought
i
had
never
been
more
comfortable
in
my
life
coleridge
had
been
there
long
enough
to
have
a
pan
of
coffee
boiling
for
us
and
having
put
our
clothes
in
the
way
of
drying
we
all
sate
down
thankful
for
a
shelter
we
could
not
prevail
upon
the
man
of
the
house
to
draw
near
the
fire
though
he
was
cold
and
wet
or
to
suffer
his
wife
to
get
him
dry
clothes
till
she
had
served
us
which
she
did
though
most
willingly
not
very
expeditiously
a
cumberland
man
of
the
same
rank
would
not
have
had
such
a
notion
of
what
was
fit
and
right
in
his
own
house
or
if
he
had
one
would
have
accused
him
of
servility
but
in
the
highlander
it
only
seemed
like
politeness
however
erroneous
and
painful
to
us
naturally
growing
out
of
the
dependence
of
the
inferiors
of
the
clan
upon
their
laird
he
did
not
however
refuse
to
let
his
wife
bring
out
the
at
our
request
she
keeps
a
dram
as
the
phrase
is
indeed
i
believe
there
is
scarcely
a
lonely
house
by
the
wayside
in
scotland
where
travellers
may
not
be
accommodated
with
a
dram
we
asked
for
sugar
butter
and
milk
and
with
a
smile
and
a
stare
more
of
kindness
than
wonder
she
replied
ye
get
that
bringing
each
article
separately
we
caroused
our
cups
of
coffee
laughing
like
children
at
the
strange
atmosphere
in
which
we
were
the
smoke
came
in
gusts
and
spread
along
the
walls
and
above
our
heads
in
the
chimney
where
the
hens
were
roosting
like
light
clouds
in
the
sky
we
laughed
and
laughed
again
in
spite
of
the
smarting
of
our
eyes
yet
had
a
quieter
pleasure
in
observing
the
beauty
of
the
beams
and
rafters
gleaming
between
the
clouds
of
smoke
they
had
been
crusted
over
and
varnished
by
many
winters
till
where
the
firelight
fell
upon
them
they
were
as
glossy
as
black
rocks
on
a
sunny
day
cased
in
ice
when
we
had
eaten
our
supper
we
sate
about
half
an
hour
and
i
think
i
had
never
felt
so
deeply
the
blessing
of
a
hospitable
welcome
and
a
warm
fire
the
man
of
the
house
repeated
from
time
to
time
that
we
should
often
tell
of
this
night
when
we
got
to
our
homes
and
interposed
praises
of
this
his
own
lake
which
he
had
more
than
once
when
we
were
returning
in
the
boat
ventured
to
say
was
bonnier
than
loch
lomond
our
companion
from
the
trossachs
who
it
appeared
was
an
edinburgh
going
during
the
vacation
on
a
pedestrian
tour
to
john
groat
house
was
to
sleep
in
the
barn
with
william
and
coleridge
where
the
man
said
he
had
plenty
of
dry
hay
i
do
not
believe
that
the
hay
of
the
highlands
is
often
very
dry
but
this
year
it
had
a
better
chance
than
usual
wet
or
dry
however
the
next
morning
they
said
they
had
slept
comfortably
when
i
went
to
bed
the
mistress
desiring
me
to
go
ben
attended
me
with
a
candle
and
assured
me
that
the
bed
was
dry
though
not
sic
as
i
had
been
used
to
it
was
of
chaff
there
were
two
others
in
the
room
a
cupboard
and
two
chests
on
one
of
which
stood
the
milk
in
wooden
vessels
covered
over
i
should
have
thought
that
milk
so
kept
could
not
have
been
sweet
but
the
cheese
and
butter
were
good
the
walls
of
the
whole
house
were
of
stone
unplastered
it
consisted
of
three
apartments
the
at
one
end
the
kitchen
or
house
in
the
middle
and
the
spence
at
the
other
end
the
rooms
were
divided
not
up
to
the
rigging
but
only
to
the
beginning
of
the
roof
so
that
there
was
a
free
passage
for
light
and
smoke
from
one
end
of
the
house
to
the
other
i
went
to
bed
some
time
before
the
family
the
door
was
shut
between
us
and
they
had
a
bright
fire
which
i
could
not
see
but
the
light
it
sent
up
among
the
varnished
rafters
and
beams
which
crossed
each
other
in
almost
as
intricate
and
fantastic
a
manner
as
i
have
seen
the
of
a
large
withered
by
the
depth
of
the
shade
above
produced
the
most
beautiful
effect
that
can
be
conceived
it
was
like
what
i
should
suppose
an
underground
cave
or
temple
to
be
with
a
dripping
or
moist
roof
and
the
moonlight
entering
in
upon
it
by
some
means
or
other
and
yet
the
colours
were
more
like
melted
gems
i
lay
looking
up
till
the
light
of
the
fire
faded
away
and
the
man
and
his
wife
and
child
had
crept
into
their
bed
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
i
did
not
sleep
much
but
passed
a
comfortable
night
for
my
bed
though
hard
was
warm
and
clean
the
unusualness
of
my
situation
prevented
me
from
sleeping
i
could
hear
the
waves
beat
against
the
shore
of
the
lake
a
little
syke
close
to
the
door
made
a
much
louder
noise
and
when
i
sate
up
in
my
bed
i
could
see
the
lake
through
an
open
at
the
bed
head
add
to
this
it
rained
all
night
i
was
less
occupied
by
remembrance
of
the
trossachs
beautiful
as
they
were
than
the
vision
of
the
highland
hut
which
i
could
not
get
out
of
my
head
i
thought
of
the
fairyland
of
spenser
and
what
i
had
read
in
romance
at
other
times
and
then
what
a
feast
would
it
be
for
a
