i
take
it
you
failed
to
win
the
hundred
pounds
sir
dedication
to
helen
cooke
wilson
chapter
one
at
in
our
paris
apartment
i
had
finished
the
honourable
george
performing
those
final
touches
that
make
the
difference
between
a
man
well
turned
out
and
a
man
merely
dressed
in
the
main
i
was
not
dissatisfied
his
dress
waistcoats
it
is
true
no
longer
permit
the
inhalation
of
anything
like
a
full
breath
and
his
collars
clasp
too
closely
i
have
always
held
that
a
collar
may
provide
quite
ample
room
for
the
throat
without
sacrifice
of
smartness
if
the
depth
be
at
least
two
and
one
quarter
inches
and
it
is
no
secret
to
either
the
honourable
george
or
our
intimates
that
i
have
never
approved
his
fashion
of
beard
a
reddish
enveloping
brushlike
affair
never
nicely
enough
trimmed
i
prefer
indeed
no
beard
at
all
but
he
stubbornly
refuses
to
shave
possessing
a
difficult
chin
still
i
repeat
he
was
not
nearly
impossible
as
he
now
left
my
hands
dining
with
the
americans
he
remarked
as
i
conveyed
the
hat
gloves
and
stick
to
him
in
their
proper
order
yes
sir
i
replied
and
might
i
suggest
sir
that
your
choice
be
a
grilled
undercut
or
something
simple
bearing
in
mind
the
undoubted
effects
of
upon
one
s
complexion
the
hard
truth
is
that
after
even
a
very
little
lobster
the
honourable
george
has
a
way
of
coming
out
in
spots
a
single
oyster
patty
too
will
often
spot
him
quite
all
over
what
cheek
decide
that
for
myself
he
retorted
with
a
lame
effort
at
dignity
which
he
was
unable
to
sustain
his
eyes
fell
from
mine
besides
i
m
almost
quite
certain
that
the
last
time
it
was
the
melon
wretched
things
melons
then
as
if
to
divert
me
he
rather
fussily
refused
the
correct
evening
stick
i
had
chosen
for
him
and
seized
a
knobby
bit
of
thornwood
suitable
only
for
moor
and
upland
work
and
brazenly
quite
discarded
the
gloves
feel
a
silly
fool
wearing
gloves
when
there
s
no
reason
he
exclaimed
pettishly
quite
so
sir
i
replied
freezing
instantly
now
don
t
play
the
juggins
he
retorted
let
me
be
comfortable
and
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
i
stand
to
win
a
hundred
quid
this
very
i
dare
say
i
replied
the
sum
was
more
than
needed
but
i
had
cause
to
be
thus
cynical
from
the
american
johnny
with
the
eyebrows
he
went
on
with
a
quite
pathetic
enthusiasm
we
re
to
play
their
american
game
of
poker
drawing
poker
as
they
call
it
i
ve
watched
them
play
for
near
a
fortnight
it
s
beastly
simple
one
has
only
to
know
when
to
a
hundred
pounds
yes
sir
and
if
one
loses
he
flashed
me
a
look
so
deucedly
queer
that
it
fair
chilled
me
i
fancy
you
ll
be
even
more
interested
than
i
if
i
lose
he
remarked
in
tones
of
a
curious
evenness
that
were
somehow
rather
deadly
the
words
seemed
pregnant
with
meaning
but
before
i
could
weigh
them
i
heard
him
noisily
descending
the
stairs
it
was
only
then
i
recalled
having
noticed
that
he
had
not
changed
to
his
varnished
boots
having
still
on
his
feet
the
doggish
and
battered
pair
he
most
favoured
it
was
a
trick
of
his
to
evade
me
with
them
i
did
for
them
each
day
all
that
human
could
do
but
they
were
things
no
sensitive
gentleman
would
endure
with
evening
dress
i
was
glad
to
reflect
that
doubtless
only
americans
would
observe
them
so
began
the
final
hours
of
a
of
july
in
paris
that
must
ever
be
memorable
my
own
birthday
it
is
also
chosen
by
the
french
as
one
on
which
to
celebrate
with
carnival
some
one
of
those
regrettable
events
in
their
own
distressing
past
to
begin
with
the
day
was
marked
first
of
all
by
the
breezing
in
of
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
brother
of
the
honourable
george
on
his
way
to
england
from
the
engadine
more
peppery
than
usual
had
his
lordship
been
his
grayish
in
angry
upheaval
and
his
inflamed
words
exploding
quite
all
over
the
place
so
that
the
honourable
george
and
i
had
both
perceived
it
to
be
no
time
for
admitting
our
recent
financial
reverse
at
the
gaming
tables
of
ostend
on
the
contrary
we
had
gamely
affirmed
the
last
quarter
s
allowance
to
be
practically
untouched
a
desperate
stand
indeed
but
there
was
that
in
his
lordship
s
manner
to
urge
us
to
it
though
even
so
he
appeared
to
be
not
more
than
half
deceived
no
good
greening
me
he
exploded
to
both
of
us
tell
in
a
flash
gambling
or
a
woman
milliner
dancing
person
what
what
guilty
faces
both
of
you
know
you
too
well
my
word
what
what
again
we
stoutly
protested
while
his
lordship
on
the
hearthrug
rocked
in
his
boots
and
glared
the
honourable
george
gamely
rattled
some
loose
coin
of
the
baser
sort
in
his
pockets
and
tried
in
return
for
a
glare
of
innocence
foully
aspersed
i
dare
say
he
fell
short
of
it
his
histrionic
gifts
are
but
meagre
fools
quite
fools
both
of
you
exploded
his
lordship
anew
and
make
it
worse
no
longer
young
fools
young
and
a
fool
people
make
excuses
say
fool
yes
but
so
young
but
old
and
a
fool
not
a
word
to
say
what
what
silly
rot
at
he
clutched
his
with
frenzied
hands
he
seemed
to
comb
them
to
a
more
bristling
rage
dare
say
you
ll
both
come
croppers
not
surprise
me
silly
old
george
course
course
hoped
better
of
ruggles
though
ruggles
different
from
old
george
got
a
brain
but
can
t
use
it
have
old
george
wed
to
a
charwoman
presently
hope
she
ll
be
a
worker
need
to
be
support
you
both
what
what
i
mean
to
say
he
was
coming
it
pretty
thick
since
he
could
not
have
forgotten
that
each
time
i
had
warned
him
so
he
could
hasten
to
save
his
brother
from
distressing
m√©salliances
i
refer
to
the
affair
with
the
and
to
the
later
entanglement
with
a
brixton
milliner
encountered
informally
under
the
portico
of
a
theatre
in
charing
cross
road
but
he
was
in
no
mood
to
concede
that
i
had
thus
far
shown
a
scrupulous
care
in
these
emergencies
peppery
he
was
indeed
he
gathered
hat
and
stick
glaring
indignantly
at
each
of
them
and
then
at
us
greened
me
fair
haven
t
you
about
money
quite
so
quite
so
not
hear
from
you
then
till
next
quarter
no
telegraphing
no
begging
letters
shouldn
t
a
bit
know
what
to
make
of
them
plenty
you
got
to
last
say
so
he
laughed
villainously
here
morning
said
he
and
was
out
old
nevil
been
annoyed
by
something
said
the
honourable
george
after
a
long
silence
know
the
old
boy
too
well
always
tell
when
he
s
been
annoyed
rather
wish
he
hadn
t
so
we
had
come
to
the
night
of
this
memorable
day
and
to
the
honourable
george
s
departure
on
his
mysterious
words
about
the
hundred
pounds
left
alone
i
began
to
meditate
profoundly
it
was
the
closing
of
a
day
i
had
seen
dawn
with
the
keenest
misgiving
having
had
reason
to
believe
it
might
be
fraught
with
significance
if
not
disaster
to
myself
the
year
before
a
gypsy
at
epsom
had
solemnly
warned
me
that
a
great
change
would
come
into
my
life
on
or
before
my
fortieth
birthday
to
this
i
might
have
paid
less
heed
but
for
its
disquieting
confirmation
on
a
later
day
at
a
psychic
parlour
in
edgware
road
proceeding
there
in
company
with
my
eldest
a
and
surfaceman
on
the
northern
he
being
uncertain
about
the
derby
winner
for
that
year
i
was
told
by
the
person
for
a
trifle
of
two
shillings
that
i
was
soon
to
cross
water
and
to
meet
many
strange
adventures
true
later
events
proved
her
to
have
been
psychically
unsound
as
to
the
derby
winner
so
that
my
who
was
out
two
pounds
ten
thereby
threatened
to
have
an
action
against
her
yet
her
reference
to
myself
had
confirmed
the
words
of
the
gypsy
so
it
will
be
plain
why
i
had
been
anxious
the
whole
of
this
birthday
for
one
thing
i
had
gone
on
the
streets
as
little
as
possible
though
i
should
naturally
have
done
that
for
the
behaviour
of
the
french
on
this
bank
holiday
of
theirs
is
repugnant
in
the
extreme
to
the
sane
english
point
of
view
i
mean
their
frivolous
public
dancing
and
marked
conversational
levity
indeed
in
their
soberest
moments
they
have
too
little
of
british
weight
their
men
are
apparently
turned
out
not
by
menservants
but
by
modistes
i
will
not
say
their
women
are
without
a
gift
for
wearing
gowns
and
their
chefs
have
unquestionably
got
at
the
inner
meaning
of
food
but
as
a
people
at
large
they
would
never
do
with
us
even
their
language
is
not
based
on
reason
i
have
had
occasion
for
example
to
acquire
their
word
for
bread
which
is
as
if
that
were
not
wild
enough
they
mispronounce
it
atrociously
yet
for
years
these
people
have
been
separated
from
us
only
by
a
narrow
strip
of
water
by
keeping
close
to
our
rooms
then
i
had
thought
to
evade
what
of
evil
might
have
been
in
store
for
me
on
this
day
another
evening
i
might
have
ventured
abroad
to
a
cinema
palace
but
this
was
no
time
for
daring
and
i
took
a
further
precaution
of
locking
our
doors
then
indeed
i
had
no
misgiving
save
that
inspired
by
the
last
words
of
the
honourable
george
in
the
event
of
his
losing
the
game
of
poker
i
was
to
be
even
more
concerned
than
he
yet
how
could
evil
come
to
me
even
should
the
american
do
him
in
the
eye
rather
frightfully
in
truth
i
had
not
the
faintest
belief
that
the
honourable
george
would
win
the
game
he
fancies
himself
a
though
why
he
should
god
knows
at
bridge
with
him
every
hand
is
a
i
need
not
say
more
also
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
american
would
be
a
person
not
accustomed
to
losing
there
was
that
about
him
more
than
once
i
had
deplored
this
rather
bohemian
taste
of
the
honourable
george
which
led
him
to
associate
with
americans
as
readily
as
with
persons
of
his
own
class
and
especially
had
i
regretted
his
intimacy
with
the
family
in
question
several
times
i
had
observed
them
on
the
occasion
of
bearing
messages
from
the
honourable
george
usually
his
acceptance
of
an
invitation
to
dine
too
obviously
they
were
rather
a
handful
i
mean
to
say
they
were
people
who
could
perhaps
matter
in
their
own
wilds
but
they
would
never
do
with
us
their
leader
with
whom
the
honourable
george
had
consented
to
game
this
evening
was
a
tall
person
with
a
narrow
dark
face
marked
with
heavy
black
brows
that
were
rather
tremendous
in
their
effect
when
he
did
not
smile
almost
at
my
first
meeting
him
i
divined
something
of
the
public
man
in
his
bearing
a
suggestion
perhaps
of
the
confirmed
orator
a
notion
in
which
i
was
somehow
further
set
by
the
gesture
with
which
he
swept
back
his
carelessly
falling
forelock
i
was
not
surprised
then
to
hear
him
referred
to
as
the
in
some
unexplained
manner
the
honourable
george
who
is
never
as
reserved
in
public
as
i
could
wish
him
to
be
had
chummed
up
with
this
person
at
one
of
the
and
had
thereafter
been
almost
quite
too
pally
with
him
and
with
the
very
curious
other
members
of
his
family
the
name
being
floud
the
wife
might
still
be
called
youngish
a
bit
florid
in
type
plumpish
with
yellow
hair
though
to
this
a
stain
had
been
applied
leaving
it
in
deficient
consonance
with
her
eyebrows
these
shading
grayish
eyes
that
crackled
with
determination
rather
on
the
large
side
she
was
forcible
of
speech
and
manner
yet
curiously
eager
i
had
at
once
detected
for
the
exactly
correct
thing
in
dress
and
deportment
the
remaining
member
of
the
family
was
a
male
cousin
of
the
senator
his
senior
evidently
by
half
a
score
of
years
since
i
took
him
to
have
reached
the
late
fifties
cousin
egbert
he
was
called
and
it
was
at
once
apparent
to
me
that
he
had
been
most
direly
subjugated
by
the
woman
whom
he
addressed
with
great
respect
as
mrs
rather
a
seamed
and
drooping
chap
he
was
with
mild
eyes
like
a
porcelain
doll
s
a
mournfully
drooped
gray
moustache
and
a
grayish
jumble
of
hair
i
early
remarked
his
hunted
look
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
timid
and
he
was
beyond
measure
such
were
the
impressions
i
had
been
able
to
glean
of
these
altogether
queer
people
during
the
fortnight
since
the
honourable
george
had
so
lawlessly
taken
them
up
lodged
they
were
in
an
hotel
among
the
most
expensive
situated
near
what
would
have
been
our
trafalgar
square
and
i
later
recalled
that
i
had
been
most
interestedly
studied
by
the
mrs
effie
on
each
of
the
few
occasions
i
appeared
there
i
mean
to
say
she
would
not
be
above
putting
to
me
intimate
questions
concerning
my
term
of
service
with
the
honourable
george
augustus
the
precise
nature
of
the
duties
i
performed
for
him
and
even
the
exact
sum
of
my
honourarium
on
the
last
occasion
she
had
remarked
and
too
well
i
recall
a
strange
glitter
in
her
competent
eyes
you
are
just
the
man
needed
by
poor
cousin
egbert
there
you
could
make
something
of
him
look
at
the
way
he
s
tied
that
cravat
after
all
i
ve
said
to
the
person
referred
to
here
shivered
noticeably
stroked
his
chin
in
a
manner
enabling
him
to
conceal
the
cravat
and
affected
nervously
to
be
taken
with
a
sight
in
the
street
below
in
some
embarrassment
i
withdrew
conscious
of
a
cold
speculative
scrutiny
bent
upon
me
by
the
woman
if
i
have
seemed
tedious
in
my
recital
of
the
known
facts
concerning
these
extraordinary
north
american
natives
it
will
i
am
sure
be
forgiven
me
in
the
light
of
those
tragic
developments
about
to
ensue
meantime
let
me
be
pictured
as
reposing
in
fancied
security
from
all
evil
predictions
while
i
awaited
the
return
of
the
honourable
george
i
was
only
too
certain
he
would
come
suffering
from
an
acute
acid
dyspepsia
for
i
had
seen
lobster
in
his
shifty
eyes
as
he
left
me
but
beyond
this
i
apprehended
nothing
poignant
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
meditating
profoundly
upon
our
situation
frankly
it
was
not
good
i
had
done
my
best
to
cheer
the
honourable
george
but
since
our
brief
sojourn
at
ostend
and
despite
the
almost
continuous
hospitality
of
the
americans
he
had
been
having
to
put
it
bluntly
an
awful
hump
at
ostend
despite
my
remonstrance
he
had
staked
and
lost
the
major
portion
of
his
quarter
s
allowance
in
testing
a
system
at
the
wheel
which
had
been
warranted
by
the
person
who
sold
it
to
him
in
london
to
break
any
bank
in
a
day
s
play
he
had
meant
to
pause
but
briefly
at
ostend
for
little
more
than
a
test
of
the
system
then
proceed
to
monte
carlo
where
his
proposed
terrific
winnings
would
occasion
less
alarm
to
the
managers
yet
at
ostend
the
system
developed
such
grave
faults
in
the
first
hour
of
play
that
we
were
forced
to
lay
up
in
paris
to
economize
for
myself
i
had
entertained
doubts
of
the
system
from
the
moment
of
its
purchase
for
it
seemed
awfully
certain
to
me
that
the
vendor
would
have
used
it
himself
instead
of
parting
with
it
for
a
couple
of
quid
he
being
in
plain
need
of
fresh
linen
and
smarter
boots
to
say
nothing
of
the
quite
impossible
he
wore
the
night
we
met
him
in
a
cab
shelter
near
covent
garden
but
the
honourable
george
had
not
listened
to
me
he
insisted
the
chap
had
made
it
all
enormously
clear
that
those
mathematical
johnnies
never
valued
money
for
its
own
sake
and
that
we
should
presently
be
as
right
as
two
sparrows
in
a
crate
fearfully
annoyed
i
was
at
the
d√©nouement
for
now
we
were
in
paris
rather
meanly
lodged
in
a
dingy
hotel
on
a
narrow
street
leading
from
what
with
us
might
have
been
piccadilly
circus
our
rooms
were
rather
a
good
height
with
a
carved
cornice
and
plaster
enrichments
but
the
furnishings
were
musty
and
the
general
air
depressing
notwithstanding
the
effect
of
a
few
good
mantel
ornaments
which
i
have
long
made
it
a
rule
to
carry
with
me
then
had
come
the
meeting
with
the
americans
glad
i
was
to
reflect
that
this
had
occurred
in
paris
instead
of
london
that
sort
of
thing
gets
about
so
even
from
paris
i
was
not
a
little
fearful
that
news
of
his
mixing
with
this
raffish
set
might
get
to
the
ears
of
his
lordship
either
at
the
town
house
or
at
true
his
lordship
is
not
with
his
brother
but
that
is
small
reason
for
affronting
the
pride
of
a
family
that
attained
its
earldom
in
the
fourteenth
century
indeed
the
family
had
become
important
quite
long
before
this
time
the
first
having
been
beheaded
by
no
less
a
personage
than
william
the
conqueror
as
i
learned
in
one
of
the
many
hours
i
have
been
privileged
to
browse
in
the
library
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
in
my
long
term
of
service
with
the
honourable
george
beginning
almost
from
the
time
my
mother
nursed
him
i
have
endeavoured
to
keep
him
up
to
his
class
combating
a
certain
laxness
that
has
hampered
him
and
most
stubborn
he
is
and
wilful
at
games
he
is
almost
quite
a
duffer
i
once
got
him
to
play
outside
left
on
a
hockey
eleven
and
he
excited
much
comment
some
of
which
was
of
a
favourable
nature
but
he
cares
little
for
hunting
or
shooting
and
though
it
is
scarce
a
matter
to
be
gossiped
of
he
loathes
cricket
perhaps
i
have
disclosed
enough
concerning
him
although
the
have
quite
almost
always
married
the
right
people
the
honourable
george
was
beyond
question
born
queer
again
in
the
matter
of
marriage
he
was
difficult
his
lordship
having
married
early
into
a
family
of
poor
lifes
was
now
long
a
widower
and
meaning
to
remain
so
he
had
been
especially
concerned
that
the
honourable
george
should
contract
a
proper
alliance
hence
our
constant
worry
lest
he
prove
too
susceptible
out
of
his
class
more
than
once
had
he
shamefully
funked
his
fences
there
was
the
distressing
instance
of
the
honourable
agatha
cradleigh
quite
all
that
could
be
desired
of
family
and
dower
she
was
years
old
a
bit
faded
though
still
eager
with
the
rather
immensely
high
forehead
and
long
thin
slightly
curved
cradleigh
nose
the
honourable
george
at
his
lordship
s
peppery
urging
had
at
last
consented
to
a
betrothal
and
our
troubles
for
a
time
promised
to
be
over
but
it
came
to
precisely
nothing
i
gathered
it
might
have
been
because
she
wore
beads
on
her
gown
and
was
interested
in
uplift
work
or
that
she
bred
canaries
these
birds
being
loathed
by
the
honourable
george
with
remarkable
intensity
though
it
might
equally
have
been
that
she
still
mourned
a
deceased
fianc√©
of
her
early
girlhood
a
curate
i
believe
whose
faded
letters
she
had
preserved
and
would
read
to
the
honourable
george
at
intimate
moments
weeping
bitterly
the
while
whatever
may
have
been
his
fancied
objection
that
is
the
time
we
disappeared
and
were
not
heard
of
for
near
a
twelvemonth
wondering
now
i
was
how
we
should
last
until
the
next
quarter
s
allowance
we
always
had
lasted
but
each
time
it
was
a
different
way
the
honourable
george
at
a
crisis
of
this
sort
invariably
spoke
of
entering
trade
and
had
actually
talked
of
selling
pointing
out
to
me
that
even
certain
rulers
of
europe
had
frankly
entered
this
trade
as
agents
it
might
have
proved
remunerative
had
he
known
anything
of
but
i
was
more
than
glad
he
did
not
for
i
have
always
considered
machinery
to
be
unrefined
much
i
preferred
that
he
be
a
company
promoter
or
something
of
that
sort
in
the
city
knowing
about
bonds
and
debentures
as
many
of
the
best
of
our
families
are
not
above
doing
it
seemed
all
he
could
do
with
propriety
having
failed
in
examinations
for
the
army
and
the
church
and
being
incurably
hostile
to
politics
which
he
declared
silly
rot
sharply
at
midnight
i
aroused
myself
from
these
gloomy
thoughts
and
breathed
a
long
sigh
of
relief
both
gipsy
and
psychic
expert
had
failed
in
their
prophecies
with
a
lightened
heart
i
set
about
the
preparations
i
knew
would
be
needed
against
the
honourable
george
s
return
strong
in
my
conviction
that
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
resist
lobster
i
made
ready
his
hot
with
its
solution
of
and
put
the
absorbent
close
by
together
with
his
his
and
his
knitted
scarcely
was
all
ready
when
i
heard
his
step
he
greeted
me
curtly
on
entering
swiftly
averting
his
face
as
i
took
his
stick
hat
and
but
i
had
seen
the
worst
at
one
glance
the
honourable
george
was
more
than
spotted
he
was
splotchy
it
was
as
bad
as
that
lobster
oysters
i
made
bold
to
remark
but
he
affected
not
to
have
heard
and
proceeded
rapidly
to
disrobe
he
accepted
the
without
demur
pulling
a
blanket
well
about
his
shoulders
complaining
of
the
water
s
temperature
and
demanding
three
of
the
not
what
you
think
at
all
he
then
said
it
was
that
cursed
jelly
always
puts
me
this
way
and
you
quite
well
know
yes
sir
to
be
sure
i
answered
gravely
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
noting
that
he
looked
quite
a
little
foolish
too
well
he
knew
i
could
not
be
deceived
and
even
now
i
could
surmise
that
the
lobster
had
been
supported
by
sherry
how
many
times
have
i
not
explained
to
him
that
sherry
has
double
the
tonic
vinosity
of
any
other
wine
and
may
not
be
tampered
with
by
the
sensitive
but
he
chose
at
present
to
make
light
of
it
almost
as
if
he
were
chaffing
above
his
knowledge
of
some
calamity
some
book
johnny
says
a
chap
is
either
a
fool
or
a
physician
at
forty
he
remarked
drawing
the
blanket
more
closely
about
him
i
should
hardly
rank
you
as
a
harley
street
consultant
sir
i
swiftly
retorted
which
was
slanging
him
enormously
because
he
had
turned
forty
i
mean
to
say
there
was
but
one
thing
he
could
take
me
as
meaning
him
to
be
since
at
forty
i
considered
him
no
physician
but
at
least
i
had
not
been
too
blunt
the
touch
about
the
harley
street
consultant
being
rather
neat
i
thought
yet
not
too
subtle
for
him
he
now
demanded
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
for
a
time
smoked
in
silence
i
could
see
that
his
mind
worked
painfully
stiffish
lot
those
americans
he
said
at
last
they
do
so
many
things
one
doesn
t
do
i
answered
and
their
brogue
is
not
what
one
could
call
is
it
now
how
often
they
say
i
guess
i
fancy
they
must
say
it
a
score
of
times
in
a
i
fancy
they
do
sir
i
agreed
i
fancy
that
johnny
with
the
eyebrows
will
say
it
even
i
fancy
so
sir
i
fancy
i
ve
counted
it
well
up
to
i
fancy
you
re
quite
right
and
the
chap
guesses
when
he
awfully
well
knows
too
that
s
the
essential
rabbit
he
said
i
guess
i
ve
got
you
beaten
to
a
pulp
when
i
fancy
he
wasn
t
guessing
at
all
i
mean
to
say
i
swear
he
knew
it
you
lost
the
game
of
drawing
poker
i
asked
coldly
though
i
knew
he
had
carried
little
to
lose
i
lost
he
began
i
observed
he
was
strangely
embarrassed
he
strangled
over
his
pipe
and
began
anew
i
said
that
to
play
the
game
soundly
you
ve
only
to
know
when
to
bluff
studied
it
out
myself
and
jolly
well
right
i
was
too
as
far
as
i
went
but
there
s
further
to
go
in
the
silly
game
i
hadn
t
observed
that
to
play
it
greatly
one
must
also
know
when
one
s
opponent
is
really
sir
oh
really
quite
important
i
assure
you
more
important
than
one
would
have
believed
watching
their
silly
ways
you
fancy
a
chap
s
bluffing
when
he
s
doing
nothing
of
the
sort
i
d
enormously
have
liked
to
know
it
before
we
played
things
would
have
been
so
awfully
different
for
us
he
broke
off
curiously
paused
then
added
for
different
for
me
sir
his
words
seemed
gruesome
they
seemed
open
to
some
vaguely
sinister
interpretation
but
i
kept
myself
steady
we
live
and
learn
sir
i
said
lightly
enough
some
of
us
learn
too
late
he
replied
increasingly
ominous
i
take
it
you
failed
to
win
the
hundred
pounds
sir
illustration
i
take
it
you
failed
to
win
the
hundred
pounds
sir
i
have
the
hundred
pounds
i
won
it
by
again
he
evaded
my
eye
played
indeed
sir
said
i
you
jolly
well
won
t
believe
that
for
now
as
he
had
the
hundred
pounds
i
couldn
t
fancy
what
the
deuce
and
all
he
meant
by
such
prattle
i
was
half
afraid
he
might
be
having
me
on
as
i
have
known
him
do
now
and
again
when
he
fancied
he
could
get
me
i
fearfully
wanted
to
ask
questions
again
i
saw
the
dark
absorbed
face
of
the
gipsy
as
he
studied
my
future
rotten
shift
life
is
now
murmured
the
honourable
george
quite
as
if
he
had
forgotten
me
if
i
d
have
but
put
through
that
monte
carlo
affair
i
dare
say
i
d
have
chucked
the
whole
business
gone
to
south
africa
perhaps
and
set
up
a
mine
or
a
plantation
shouldn
t
have
come
back
just
cut
off
and
to
this
mess
but
no
capital
can
t
do
things
without
capital
where
these
american
johnnies
have
the
pull
of
us
do
anything
nearly
do
what
they
jolly
well
like
to
no
sense
to
money
stuff
that
runs
blind
look
at
the
silly
beggars
that
have
it
on
he
went
quite
alarmingly
with
his
tirade
almost
as
violent
he
was
as
an
chap
i
once
heard
ranting
when
i
went
with
my
to
a
meeting
of
the
north
brixton
radical
club
quite
like
an
anarchist
he
was
presently
he
quieted
after
a
long
pull
at
his
pipe
he
regarded
me
with
an
entire
change
of
manner
well
i
knew
something
was
coming
coming
swift
as
a
rocketing
woodcock
word
for
word
i
put
down
our
incredible
speeches
you
are
going
out
to
america
yes
sir
north
or
south
sir
north
i
fancy
somewhere
on
the
west
coast
ohio
omaha
one
of
those
indian
perhaps
indiana
or
the
yellowstone
valley
the
chap
s
a
sort
of
the
chap
sir
eyebrow
chap
money
no
end
mines
lumber
domestic
animals
that
sort
of
beg
pardon
sir
i
m
to
go
chap
s
wife
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
would
have
you
to
do
for
the
funny
sad
beggar
so
he
s
won
you
won
you
in
a
game
of
drawing
poker
another
man
would
have
done
as
well
but
the
creature
was
keen
for
you
great
strength
of
character
determined
sort
hope
you
won
t
think
i
didn
t
play
soundly
but
it
s
not
a
forthright
game
think
they
re
bluffing
when
they
aren
t
when
they
are
you
mayn
t
think
it
so
far
as
hiding
one
s
intentions
it
s
a
most
rottenly
immoral
game
low
animal
cunning
that
sort
of
do
i
understand
i
was
the
stake
sir
i
controlled
myself
to
say
the
heavens
seemed
bursting
about
my
head
ultimately
lost
you
were
by
the
very
trifling
margin
of
superiority
that
a
hand
known
as
a
club
flush
bears
over
another
hand
consisting
of
three
of
the
eights
not
quite
all
of
them
you
understand
only
three
and
two
other
quite
meaningless
i
could
but
stammer
piteously
i
fear
i
heard
myself
make
a
wretched
failure
of
words
that
crowded
to
my
lips
but
it
s
quite
simple
i
tell
you
i
dare
say
i
could
show
it
you
in
a
moment
if
you
ve
cards
in
your
thank
you
sir
i
ll
not
trouble
you
i
m
certain
it
was
simple
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
exactly
the
game
was
played
for
knew
you
d
not
understand
at
once
my
word
it
was
not
too
bally
simple
if
i
won
i
d
a
hundred
pounds
if
i
lost
i
d
to
give
you
up
to
them
but
still
to
receive
a
hundred
pounds
i
suspect
the
johnny
s
conscience
pricked
him
thought
you
were
worth
a
hundred
pounds
and
guessed
all
the
time
he
could
do
me
awfully
in
the
eye
with
his
poker
quite
set
they
were
on
having
you
eyebrow
chap
seemed
to
think
it
a
jolly
good
wheeze
she
didn
t
though
quite
off
her
head
at
having
you
for
that
glum
one
who
does
himself
so
dazed
i
was
to
be
sure
scarce
comprehending
the
calamity
that
had
befallen
us
am
i
to
understand
sir
that
i
am
now
in
the
service
of
the
americans
stupid
of
course
of
course
explained
clearly
haven
t
i
about
the
club
flush
and
the
three
eights
only
three
of
them
mind
you
if
the
other
one
had
been
in
my
hand
i
d
have
done
him
as
narrow
a
squeak
as
that
but
i
lost
and
you
may
be
certain
i
lost
gamely
as
a
gentleman
should
no
laughing
matter
but
i
laughed
with
them
except
the
funny
sad
one
he
was
worried
and
made
no
secret
of
it
they
were
good
enough
to
say
i
took
my
loss
like
a
dead
more
of
it
followed
but
always
the
same
ever
he
came
back
to
the
sickening
concise
point
that
i
was
to
go
out
to
the
american
wilderness
with
these
grotesque
folk
who
had
but
the
most
elementary
notions
of
what
one
does
and
what
one
does
not
do
always
he
concluded
with
his
boast
that
he
had
taken
his
loss
like
a
dead
sport
he
became
vexed
at
last
by
my
painful
efforts
to
understand
how
precisely
the
dreadful
thing
had
come
about
but
neither
could
i
endure
more
i
fled
to
my
room
he
had
tried
again
to
impress
upon
me
that
three
eights
are
but
slightly
inferior
to
the
flush
of
clubs
i
faced
my
glass
my
ordinary
smooth
full
face
seemed
to
have
shrivelled
the
marks
of
my
anguish
were
upon
me
vainly
had
i
locked
myself
in
the
gipsy
s
warning
had
borne
its
evil
fruit
sold
i
d
been
even
as
once
the
poor
blackamoors
were
sold
into
american
bondage
i
recalled
one
of
their
pathetic
in
which
the
wretches
were
wont
to
make
light
of
their
lamentable
estate
a
thing
i
had
often
heard
sung
by
a
black
with
a
banjo
on
the
pier
at
brighton
not
a
genuine
black
only
dyed
for
the
moment
he
was
but
i
had
never
lost
the
plaintive
quality
of
the
verses
away
down
south
in
michigan
where
i
was
so
happy
and
so
gay
twas
there
i
mowed
the
cotton
and
the
cane
how
poignantly
the
simple
words
came
back
to
me
a
slave
day
after
day
mowing
his
owner
s
cotton
and
cane
plucking
the
maize
from
the
savannahs
yet
happy
and
gay
should
i
be
equal
to
this
spirit
the
honourable
george
had
lost
so
i
his
pawn
must
also
submit
like
a
dead
sport
how
little
i
then
dreamed
what
adventures
what
adversities
what
ignominies
yes
and
what
triumphs
were
to
be
mine
in
those
back
blocks
of
north
america
i
saw
but
a
bleak
wilderness
a
distressing
contact
with
people
who
never
for
a
moment
would
do
with
us
i
shuddered
i
despaired
and
outside
the
windows
gay
paris
laughed
and
sang
in
the
dance
ever
unheeding
my
plight
chapter
two
in
that
first
sleep
how
often
do
we
dream
that
our
calamity
has
been
only
a
dream
it
was
so
in
my
first
moments
of
awakening
vestiges
of
some
grotesquely
hideous
nightmare
remained
with
me
wearing
the
shackles
of
the
slave
i
had
been
mowing
the
corn
under
the
fierce
sun
that
beats
down
upon
the
american
savannahs
sickeningly
then
a
wind
of
memory
blew
upon
me
and
i
was
alive
to
my
situation
nor
was
i
forgetful
of
the
plight
in
which
the
honourable
george
would
now
find
himself
he
is
as
good
as
lost
when
not
properly
looked
after
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
he
is
a
simple
trusting
incompetent
duffer
if
ever
there
was
one
even
in
so
rudimentary
a
matter
as
he
is
like
a
mariner
i
mean
to
say
like
a
chap
in
a
boat
on
the
ocean
who
doesn
t
know
what
sails
to
pull
up
nor
how
to
steer
the
silly
rudder
one
rather
feels
exactly
that
about
him
and
now
he
was
bound
to
go
seedy
beyond
description
like
the
time
at
mentone
when
he
dreamed
a
system
for
playing
the
little
horses
after
which
for
a
fortnight
i
was
obliged
to
nurse
a
invalid
in
order
that
we
might
last
over
till
next
remittance
day
the
havoc
he
managed
to
wreak
among
his
belongings
in
that
time
would
scarce
be
believed
should
i
set
it
down
not
even
a
single
boot
properly
treed
and
his
appearance
when
i
was
enabled
to
recover
him
my
client
having
behaved
most
handsomely
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
for
spain
being
such
that
i
passed
him
in
the
hotel
lounge
without
even
a
nod
with
trousers
from
his
one
suit
of
boating
flannels
a
blazered
golfing
waistcoat
his
best
with
the
wide
braid
a
and
a
with
his
beard
more
than
discursive
as
one
might
say
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
if
i
disclose
this
thing
it
is
only
that
my
fears
for
him
may
be
comprehended
when
i
pictured
him
being
permanently
out
of
hand
meditating
thus
bitterly
i
had
but
finished
dressing
when
i
was
startled
by
a
knock
on
my
door
and
by
the
entrance
to
my
summons
of
the
elder
and
more
subdued
floud
he
of
the
drooping
mustaches
and
the
mournful
eyes
of
pale
blue
one
glance
at
his
attire
brought
freshly
to
my
mind
the
atrocious
difficulties
of
my
new
situation
i
may
be
credited
or
not
but
combined
with
tan
boots
and
wretchedly
fitting
trousers
of
a
purple
hue
he
wore
a
black
revealing
far
far
too
much
of
a
blue
satin
made
cravat
on
which
was
painted
a
cluster
of
tiny
white
flowers
lilies
of
the
valley
i
should
say
unbelievably
above
this
monstrous
m√©lange
was
a
rather
bowler
hat
hardly
repressing
a
shudder
i
bowed
whereupon
he
advanced
solemnly
to
me
and
put
out
his
hand
to
cover
the
embarrassing
situation
tactfully
i
extended
my
own
and
we
actually
shook
hands
although
the
clasp
was
limply
quite
formal
how
do
you
do
ruggles
he
began
i
bowed
again
but
speech
failed
me
she
sent
me
over
to
get
you
he
went
on
he
uttered
the
word
she
with
such
profound
awe
that
i
knew
he
could
mean
none
other
than
effie
it
was
most
extraordinary
but
i
dare
say
only
what
was
to
have
been
expected
from
persons
of
this
sort
in
any
club
or
among
gentlemen
at
large
it
is
customary
to
allow
one
at
least
hours
for
the
payment
of
one
s
gambling
debts
yet
there
i
was
being
collected
by
the
winner
at
so
early
an
hour
as
seven
if
i
had
been
a
note
instead
of
myself
i
fancy
it
would
have
been
quite
the
same
these
americans
would
most
indecently
have
sent
for
their
winnings
before
the
honourable
george
had
awakened
one
would
have
thought
they
had
expected
him
to
refuse
payment
of
me
after
losing
me
the
night
before
how
little
they
seemed
to
realize
that
we
were
both
intending
to
be
dead
sportsmen
very
good
sir
i
said
but
i
trust
i
may
be
allowed
to
brew
the
honourable
george
his
tea
before
leaving
i
d
hardly
like
to
trust
to
him
alone
with
it
yes
sir
he
said
so
respectfully
that
it
gave
me
an
odd
feeling
take
your
time
ruggles
i
don
t
know
as
i
am
in
any
hurry
on
my
own
account
it
s
only
account
of
i
trust
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
reporting
this
person
s
speeches
i
am
making
an
earnest
effort
to
set
them
down
word
for
word
in
all
their
terrific
peculiarities
i
mean
to
say
i
would
not
be
held
accountable
for
his
phrasing
and
if
i
corrected
his
speech
as
of
course
the
tendency
is
our
identities
might
become
confused
i
hope
this
will
be
understood
when
i
report
him
as
saying
things
in
ways
one
doesn
t
word
them
i
mean
to
say
that
it
should
not
be
thought
that
i
would
say
them
in
this
way
if
it
chanced
that
i
were
saying
the
same
things
in
my
proper
person
i
fancy
this
should
now
be
plain
very
well
sir
i
said
if
it
was
me
he
went
on
i
wouldn
t
want
you
a
little
bit
but
it
s
her
she
s
got
her
mind
made
up
to
do
the
right
thing
and
have
us
all
be
somebody
and
when
she
makes
her
mind
up
he
hesitated
and
studied
the
ceiling
for
some
seconds
believe
me
he
continued
mrs
effie
is
some
wildcat
yes
sir
some
wildcat
i
repeated
believe
bill
he
said
again
quaintly
addressing
me
by
a
name
not
my
own
believe
me
she
d
fight
a
rattlesnake
and
give
it
the
first
two
again
let
it
be
recalled
that
i
put
down
this
extraordinary
speech
exactly
as
i
heard
it
i
thought
to
detect
in
it
that
grotesque
exaggeration
with
which
the
americans
so
distressingly
embellish
their
humour
i
mean
to
say
it
could
hardly
have
been
meant
in
all
seriousness
so
far
as
my
researches
have
extended
the
rattlesnake
is
an
invariably
poisonous
reptile
fancy
giving
one
so
downright
an
advantage
as
the
first
two
bites
or
even
one
bite
although
i
believe
the
thing
does
not
in
fact
bite
at
all
but
does
one
down
with
its
forked
tongue
of
which
there
is
an
excellent
drawing
in
my
little
volume
inquire
within
useful
yes
sir
i
replied
somewhat
at
a
loss
quite
so
sir
i
just
thought
i
d
wise
you
up
thank
you
sir
i
said
for
his
intention
beneath
the
weird
jargon
was
somehow
benevolent
and
if
you
ll
be
good
enough
to
wait
until
i
have
taken
tea
to
the
honourable
george
how
is
the
judge
this
morning
he
broke
in
the
judge
sir
i
was
at
a
loss
until
he
gestured
toward
the
room
of
the
honourable
george
the
judge
yes
ain
t
he
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
something
but
no
sir
not
at
all
then
what
do
you
call
him
honourable
for
if
he
ain
t
a
judge
or
something
well
sir
it
s
done
sir
i
explained
but
i
fear
he
was
unable
to
catch
my
meaning
for
a
moment
later
the
honourable
george
hearing
our
voices
had
thrown
a
boot
smartly
against
the
door
he
was
addressing
him
as
judge
and
thereafter
continued
to
do
so
nor
did
the
honourable
george
seem
to
make
any
moment
of
being
thus
miscalled
i
served
the
ceylon
tea
together
with
biscuits
and
marmalade
the
while
our
caller
chatted
nervously
he
had
it
appeared
procured
his
own
breakfast
while
on
his
way
to
us
i
got
to
have
my
ham
and
eggs
of
a
morning
he
confided
but
she
won
t
let
me
have
anything
at
that
hotel
but
a
continental
breakfast
which
is
nothing
but
coffee
and
toast
and
some
of
that
there
sauce
you
re
eating
she
says
when
i
m
on
the
continent
i
got
to
eat
a
continental
breakfast
because
that
s
the
smart
thing
to
do
and
not
stuff
myself
like
i
was
on
the
ranch
but
i
got
that
game
beat
both
ways
from
the
jack
i
duck
out
every
morning
before
she
s
up
i
found
a
place
where
you
can
get
regular
ham
and
regular
ham
and
eggs
murmured
the
honourable
george
french
ham
and
eggs
is
a
joke
they
put
a
slice
of
boiled
ham
in
a
little
dish
slosh
a
couple
of
eggs
on
it
and
tuck
the
dish
into
the
oven
a
few
minutes
say
they
won
t
ever
believe
that
back
in
red
gap
when
i
tell
it
but
i
found
this
here
little
place
where
they
do
it
right
account
of
americans
having
made
trouble
so
much
over
the
other
way
but
mind
you
don
t
let
on
to
her
he
warned
me
suddenly
certainly
not
sir
i
said
trust
me
to
be
discreet
all
right
then
maybe
we
ll
get
on
better
than
what
i
thought
we
would
i
was
looking
for
trouble
with
you
the
way
she
s
been
talking
about
what
you
d
do
for
i
trust
matters
will
be
pleasant
sir
i
replied
i
can
be
pushed
just
so
far
he
curiously
warned
me
and
no
farther
not
by
any
man
that
wears
yes
sir
i
said
again
wondering
what
the
wearing
of
hair
might
mean
to
this
process
of
pushing
him
and
feeling
rather
absurdly
glad
that
my
own
face
is
smoothly
shaven
you
ll
find
ruggles
fairish
enough
after
you
ve
got
used
to
his
ways
put
in
the
honourable
george
all
right
judge
and
remember
it
wasn
t
my
doings
said
my
new
employer
rising
and
pulling
down
to
his
ears
his
fearful
bowler
hat
and
now
we
better
report
to
her
before
she
does
a
over
here
you
can
pack
your
grip
later
in
the
day
he
added
to
me
pack
my
grip
yes
sir
i
said
numbly
for
i
was
on
the
tick
of
leaving
the
honourable
george
helpless
in
bed
in
a
voice
that
i
fear
was
broken
i
spoke
of
clothes
for
the
day
s
wear
which
i
had
laid
out
for
him
the
night
before
he
waved
a
hand
bravely
at
us
and
sank
back
into
his
pillow
as
my
new
employer
led
me
forth
there
had
been
barely
a
glance
between
us
to
betoken
the
dreadfulness
of
the
moment
at
our
door
i
was
pleased
to
note
that
a
taximetre
cab
awaited
us
i
had
acutely
dreaded
a
walk
through
the
streets
even
of
paris
with
my
new
employer
garbed
as
he
was
the
blue
satin
cravat
of
itself
would
have
been
bound
to
insure
us
more
attention
than
one
would
care
for
i
fear
we
were
both
somewhat
moody
during
the
short
ride
each
of
us
seemed
to
have
matters
of
weight
to
reflect
upon
only
upon
reaching
our
destination
did
my
companion
brighten
a
bit
for
a
fare
of
five
francs
forty
centimes
he
gave
the
driver
a
piece
and
waited
for
no
change
i
always
get
around
them
that
way
he
said
with
an
expression
of
the
brightest
cunning
she
used
to
have
the
laugh
on
me
because
i
got
so
much
counterfeit
money
handed
to
me
now
i
don
t
take
any
change
at
yes
sir
i
said
quite
right
there
s
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat
he
added
as
we
ascended
to
the
floud
s
though
why
his
mind
should
have
flown
to
this
brutal
sport
if
it
be
a
sport
was
quite
beyond
me
at
the
door
he
paused
and
hissed
at
me
remember
no
matter
what
she
says
if
you
treat
me
white
i
ll
treat
you
and
before
i
could
frame
any
suitable
response
to
this
puzzling
announcement
he
had
opened
the
door
and
pushed
me
in
almost
before
i
could
remove
my
cap
seated
at
the
table
over
coffee
and
rolls
was
effie
her
face
brightened
as
she
saw
me
then
froze
to
disapproval
as
her
glance
rested
upon
him
i
was
to
know
as
cousin
egbert
i
saw
her
capable
mouth
set
in
a
straight
line
of
determination
you
did
your
very
worst
didn
t
you
she
began
but
sit
down
and
eat
your
breakfast
he
ll
soon
change
she
turned
to
me
now
ruggles
i
hope
you
understand
the
situation
and
i
m
sure
i
can
trust
you
to
take
no
nonsense
from
him
you
see
plainly
what
you
ve
got
to
do
i
let
him
dress
to
suit
himself
this
morning
so
that
you
could
know
the
worst
at
once
take
a
good
look
at
him
shoes
coat
hat
that
dreadful
cravat
i
call
this
a
right
pretty
necktie
mumbled
her
victim
over
a
crust
of
toast
she
had
poured
coffee
for
him
you
hear
that
she
asked
me
i
bowed
sympathetically
what
does
he
look
like
she
insisted
just
tell
him
for
his
own
good
but
this
i
could
not
do
true
enough
during
our
short
ride
he
had
been
reminding
me
of
one
of
a
pair
of
comedians
i
had
once
seen
in
a
this
of
course
was
not
a
thing
one
could
say
i
dare
say
madam
he
could
be
smartened
up
a
bit
if
i
might
take
him
to
some
shop
and
burn
the
things
he
s
got
on
she
broke
in
not
this
here
necktie
interrupted
cousin
egbert
rather
stubbornly
it
was
give
to
me
by
jeff
tuttle
s
littlest
girl
last
christmas
and
this
here
prince
albert
coat
what
s
the
matter
of
it
i
d
like
to
know
it
come
right
from
the
one
price
clothing
store
at
red
gap
and
it
s
plenty
good
to
go
to
funerals
in
and
then
to
a
with
him
went
on
effie
who
had
paid
no
heed
to
his
outburst
get
him
done
right
for
her
relative
continued
to
nibble
nervously
at
a
bit
of
toast
i
ve
done
something
with
him
myself
she
said
watching
him
narrowly
at
first
he
insisted
on
having
the
whole
for
breakfast
but
i
put
my
foot
down
and
now
he
s
satisfied
with
the
continental
breakfast
that
goes
to
show
he
has
something
in
him
if
we
can
only
bring
it
something
in
him
indeed
yes
madam
i
assented
and
cousin
egbert
turning
to
me
winked
heavily
i
want
him
to
look
like
some
one
she
resumed
and
i
think
you
re
the
man
can
make
him
if
you
re
firm
with
him
but
you
ll
have
to
be
firm
because
he
s
full
of
tricks
and
if
he
starts
any
rough
stuff
just
come
to
quite
so
madam
i
said
but
i
felt
i
was
blushing
with
shame
at
hearing
one
of
my
own
sex
so
slanged
by
a
woman
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
with
us
and
yet
there
was
something
about
this
woman
something
weirdly
authoritative
she
showed
rather
well
in
the
morning
light
her
gray
eyes
crackling
as
she
talked
she
was
wearing
a
most
elaborate
peignoir
and
of
course
she
should
not
have
worn
the
diamonds
it
seemed
almost
too
much
like
the
morning
hour
of
a
stage
favourite
but
still
one
felt
that
when
she
talked
one
would
do
well
to
listen
hereupon
cousin
egbert
startled
me
once
more
won
t
you
set
up
and
have
something
with
us
ruggles
he
asked
me
i
looked
away
affecting
not
to
have
heard
and
could
feel
effie
scowling
at
him
he
coughed
into
his
cup
and
sprayed
coffee
well
over
himself
his
intention
had
been
obvious
in
the
main
though
exactly
what
he
had
meant
by
setting
up
i
couldn
t
fancy
as
if
i
had
been
a
performing
poodle
the
moment
s
embarrassment
was
well
covered
by
effie
who
again
renewed
her
instructions
and
from
an
escritoire
brought
me
a
sheaf
of
the
pretentiously
printed
sheets
which
the
french
use
in
place
of
our
banknotes
you
will
spare
no
expense
she
directed
and
don
t
let
me
see
him
again
until
he
looks
like
some
one
try
to
have
him
back
here
by
five
some
very
smart
friends
of
ours
are
coming
for
i
won
t
drink
tea
at
that
outlandish
hour
for
any
one
said
cousin
egbert
rather
snappishly
you
will
at
least
refuse
it
like
a
man
of
the
world
i
hope
she
replied
icily
and
he
drooped
submissive
once
more
you
see
she
added
to
me
quite
so
madam
i
said
and
resolved
to
be
firm
and
thorough
with
cousin
egbert
in
a
way
i
was
put
upon
my
mettle
i
swore
to
make
him
look
like
some
one
moreover
i
now
saw
that
his
threats
of
rebellion
to
me
had
been
pure
swank
i
had
in
turn
but
to
threaten
to
report
him
to
this
woman
and
he
would
be
as
clay
in
my
hands
i
presently
had
him
tucked
into
a
closed
taxicab
muttering
expostulations
and
protests
to
which
i
paid
not
the
least
heed
during
my
strolls
i
had
observed
in
what
would
have
been
regent
street
at
home
a
rather
shop
with
an
english
name
and
to
this
i
now
proceeded
with
my
charge
i
am
afraid
i
rather
hustled
him
across
the
pavement
and
into
the
shop
not
knowing
what
tricks
he
might
be
up
to
and
not
until
he
was
well
to
the
back
did
i
attempt
to
explain
myself
to
the
who
had
followed
us
to
him
i
then
gave
details
of
my
charge
s
escape
from
a
burning
hotel
the
previous
night
which
accounted
for
his
extraordinary
garb
of
the
moment
he
having
been
obliged
to
accept
the
loan
of
garments
that
neither
fitted
him
nor
harmonized
with
one
another
i
mean
to
say
i
did
not
care
to
have
the
chap
suspect
we
would
don
tan
boots
a
and
bowler
hat
except
under
the
most
tremendous
compulsion
cousin
egbert
stared
at
me
open
mouthed
during
this
recital
but
the
was
only
too
readily
convinced
as
indeed
who
would
not
have
been
and
called
an
intelligent
assistant
to
relieve
our
distress
with
his
help
i
swiftly
selected
an
outfit
that
was
not
half
bad
for
garments
there
was
a
black
snug
at
the
waist
moderately
broad
at
the
shoulders
closing
with
two
buttons
its
skirt
sharply
cut
away
from
the
lower
button
and
reaching
to
the
bend
of
the
knee
the
lapels
were
of
course
and
joined
the
collar
with
a
triangular
notch
it
is
a
coat
of
immense
character
when
properly
worn
and
i
was
delighted
to
observe
in
the
trying
on
that
cousin
egbert
filled
it
rather
smartly
moreover
he
submitted
more
meekly
than
i
had
hoped
the
trousers
i
selected
were
of
gray
cloth
faintly
striped
the
waistcoat
being
of
the
same
material
as
the
coat
relieved
at
the
by
an
edging
of
white
with
the
boots
i
had
rather
more
trouble
as
he
refused
to
wear
the
patent
leathers
that
i
selected
together
with
the
pearl
gray
spats
until
i
grimly
requested
the
telephone
assistant
to
put
me
through
to
the
hotel
desiring
to
speak
to
mrs
senator
floud
this
brought
him
around
although
muttering
and
i
had
less
trouble
with
shirts
collars
and
cravats
i
chose
a
shirt
of
white
piqu√©
a
wing
collar
with
small
tabs
and
a
pearl
ascot
then
in
a
cabinet
i
superintended
cousin
egbert
s
change
of
raiment
we
clashed
again
in
the
matter
of
which
i
was
astounded
to
observe
he
did
not
possess
he
insisted
that
he
had
never
worn
them
garters
he
called
them
and
never
would
if
he
were
shot
for
it
so
i
decided
to
be
content
with
what
i
had
already
gained
by
dint
of
urging
and
threatening
i
at
length
achieved
my
and
was
more
than
a
little
pleased
with
my
effect
as
was
the
after
i
had
tied
the
pearl
ascot
and
adjusted
a
quiet
of
my
own
choosing
now
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
growled
my
charge
seizing
his
bowler
hat
and
edging
off
by
no
means
i
said
coldly
the
hat
if
you
please
he
gave
it
up
rebelliously
and
i
had
again
to
threaten
him
with
the
telephone
before
he
would
submit
to
a
with
a
moderate
bell
and
broad
brim
surveying
this
in
the
glass
however
he
became
perceptibly
reconciled
it
was
plain
that
he
rather
fancied
it
though
as
yet
he
wore
it
consciously
and
would
turn
his
head
slowly
and
painfully
as
if
his
neck
were
stiffened
having
chosen
the
proper
gloves
i
was
i
repeat
more
than
pleased
with
this
severely
simple
scheme
of
black
white
and
gray
i
felt
i
had
been
wise
to
resist
any
tendency
to
colour
even
to
the
most
delicate
of
pastel
tints
my
last
selection
was
a
smartish
malacca
stick
the
ideal
stick
for
town
wear
which
i
thrust
into
the
defenceless
hands
of
my
client
and
now
sir
i
said
firmly
it
is
but
a
step
to
a
barber
s
stop
where
english
is
and
ruefully
he
accompanied
me
i
dare
say
that
by
that
time
he
had
discovered
that
i
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
for
during
his
hour
in
the
barber
s
chair
he
did
not
once
rebel
openly
only
at
times
would
he
roll
his
eyes
to
mine
in
dumb
appeal
there
was
in
them
something
of
the
utter
confiding
helplessness
i
had
noted
in
the
eyes
of
an
old
setter
at
when
i
had
been
called
upon
to
assist
the
undergardener
in
chloroforming
him
i
mean
to
say
the
dog
had
jolly
well
known
something
terrible
was
being
done
to
him
yet
his
eyes
seemed
to
say
he
knew
it
must
be
all
for
the
best
and
that
he
trusted
us
it
was
this
look
i
caught
as
i
gave
directions
about
the
trimming
of
the
hair
and
especially
when
i
directed
that
something
radical
should
be
done
to
the
long
grayish
moustache
that
fell
to
either
side
of
his
chin
in
the
form
of
a
horseshoe
i
myself
was
puzzled
by
this
difficulty
but
the
barber
solved
it
rather
neatly
i
thought
after
a
whispered
consultation
with
me
he
snipped
a
bit
off
each
end
and
then
stoutly
waxed
the
whole
affair
until
the
ends
stood
stiffly
out
with
distinct
military
implications
i
shall
never
forget
and
indeed
i
was
not
a
little
touched
by
the
look
of
quivering
anguish
in
the
eyes
of
my
client
when
he
first
beheld
this
novel
effect
and
yet
when
we
were
once
more
in
the
street
i
could
not
but
admit
that
the
change
was
worth
all
that
it
had
cost
him
in
suffering
strangely
he
now
looked
like
some
one
especially
after
i
had
persuaded
him
to
a
carnation
for
his
buttonhole
i
can
not
say
that
his
carriage
was
all
that
it
should
have
been
and
he
was
still
conscious
of
his
smart
attire
but
i
nevertheless
felt
a
distinct
thrill
of
pride
in
my
own
work
and
was
eager
to
reveal
him
to
effie
in
his
new
guise
but
first
he
would
have
luncheon
dinner
he
called
it
and
i
was
not
averse
to
this
for
i
had
put
in
a
long
and
trying
morning
i
went
with
him
to
the
little
restaurant
where
americans
had
made
so
much
trouble
about
ham
and
eggs
and
there
he
insisted
that
i
should
join
him
in
chops
and
potatoes
and
ale
i
thought
it
only
proper
then
to
point
out
to
him
that
there
was
certain
differences
in
our
walks
of
life
which
should
be
more
or
less
denoted
by
his
manner
of
addressing
me
among
other
things
he
should
not
address
me
as
ruggles
nor
was
it
customary
for
a
valet
to
eat
at
the
same
table
with
his
master
he
seemed
much
interested
in
these
distinctions
and
thereupon
addressed
me
as
colonel
which
was
of
course
quite
absurd
but
this
i
could
not
make
him
see
thereafter
i
may
say
that
he
called
me
impartially
either
colonel
or
it
was
a
situation
that
i
had
never
before
been
obliged
to
meet
and
i
found
it
trying
in
the
extreme
he
was
a
chap
who
seemed
ready
to
pal
up
with
any
one
and
i
could
not
but
recall
the
strange
assertion
i
had
so
often
heard
that
in
america
one
never
knows
who
is
one
s
superior
fancy
that
it
would
never
do
with
us
i
could
only
determine
to
be
on
my
guard
our
luncheon
done
he
consented
to
accompany
me
to
the
hotel
of
the
honourable
george
whence
i
wished
to
remove
my
belongings
i
should
have
preferred
to
go
alone
but
i
was
too
fearful
of
what
he
might
do
to
himself
or
his
clothes
in
my
absence
we
found
the
honourable
george
still
in
bed
as
i
had
feared
he
had
it
seemed
been
unable
to
discover
his
collar
studs
which
though
i
had
placed
them
in
a
fresh
shirt
for
him
he
had
carelessly
covered
with
a
blanket
begging
cousin
egbert
to
be
seated
in
my
room
i
did
a
few
of
the
more
obvious
things
required
by
my
late
master
you
d
leave
me
here
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
he
said
reproachfully
which
i
thought
almost
quite
a
little
unjust
i
mean
to
say
it
had
all
been
his
own
doing
he
having
lost
me
in
the
game
of
drawing
poker
so
why
should
he
row
me
about
it
now
i
silently
laid
out
the
shirt
once
more
you
might
have
told
me
where
i
m
to
find
my
brown
tweeds
and
the
body
again
he
was
addressing
me
as
if
i
had
voluntarily
left
him
without
notice
but
i
observed
that
he
was
still
mildly
speckled
from
the
night
before
so
i
handed
him
the
and
went
to
pack
my
own
box
cousin
egbert
i
found
sitting
as
i
had
left
him
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
carefully
holding
his
hat
stick
and
gloves
and
staring
into
the
wall
he
had
promised
me
faithfully
not
to
fumble
with
his
cravat
and
evidently
he
had
not
once
stirred
i
packed
my
box
swiftly
my
grip
as
he
called
it
and
we
were
presently
off
once
more
without
another
sight
of
the
honourable
george
who
was
to
join
us
at
tea
i
could
hear
him
moving
about
using
rather
language
but
i
lacked
heart
for
further
speech
with
him
at
the
moment
an
hour
later
in
the
floud
i
had
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
displaying
to
effie
the
happy
changes
i
had
been
able
to
effect
in
my
charge
posing
him
i
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
chamber
she
came
at
once
and
drew
a
long
breath
as
she
surveyed
him
from
varnished
boots
spats
and
coat
to
which
he
still
wore
he
leaned
rather
well
on
his
stick
the
hand
to
his
hip
the
elbow
out
while
the
other
hand
lightly
held
his
gloves
a
moment
she
looked
then
gave
a
low
cry
of
wonder
and
delight
so
that
i
felt
repaid
for
my
trouble
indeed
as
she
faced
me
to
thank
me
i
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
dimmed
wonderful
she
exclaimed
now
he
looks
like
some
one
and
i
distinctly
perceived
that
only
just
in
time
did
she
repress
an
impulse
to
grasp
me
by
the
hand
under
the
circumstances
i
am
not
sure
that
i
wouldn
t
have
overlooked
the
lapse
had
she
yielded
to
it
wonderful
she
said
again
illustration
wonderful
now
he
looks
like
some
one
hereupon
cousin
egbert
much
embarrassed
leaned
his
stick
against
the
wall
the
stick
fell
and
in
reaching
down
for
it
his
hat
fell
and
in
reaching
for
that
he
dropped
his
gloves
but
i
soon
restored
him
to
order
and
he
was
safely
seated
where
he
might
be
studied
in
further
detail
especially
as
to
his
moustaches
which
i
had
considered
rather
the
supreme
touch
he
looks
exactly
like
some
clubman
exclaimed
effie
her
relative
growled
as
if
he
were
quite
ready
to
savage
her
like
a
man
about
town
she
murmured
who
would
have
thought
he
had
it
in
him
until
you
brought
it
out
i
knew
then
that
we
two
should
understand
each
other
the
slight
tension
was
here
relieved
by
two
of
the
hotel
servants
who
brought
tea
things
at
a
nod
from
effie
i
directed
the
laying
out
of
these
at
that
moment
came
the
other
floud
he
of
the
eyebrows
and
a
cousin
cub
called
elmer
who
i
understood
studied
art
i
became
aware
that
they
were
both
suddenly
engaged
and
silenced
by
the
sight
of
cousin
egbert
i
caught
their
amazed
stares
and
then
terrifically
they
broke
into
gales
of
laughter
the
cub
threw
himself
on
a
couch
waving
his
feet
in
the
air
and
holding
his
middle
as
if
he
d
suffered
a
sudden
acute
dyspepsia
while
the
elder
threw
his
head
back
and
shrieked
hysterically
cousin
egbert
merely
glared
at
them
and
endeavouring
to
stroke
his
moustache
succeeded
in
unwaxing
one
side
of
it
so
that
it
once
more
hung
limply
down
his
chin
whereat
they
renewed
their
boorishness
the
elder
floud
was
now
quite
dangerously
purple
and
the
cub
on
the
couch
was
shrieking
no
matter
how
dark
the
clouds
remember
she
is
still
your
stepmother
or
words
to
some
such
silly
effect
as
that
how
it
might
have
ended
i
hardly
dare
conjecture
perhaps
cousin
egbert
would
presently
have
roughed
them
but
a
knock
sounded
and
it
became
my
duty
to
open
our
door
upon
other
guests
women
mostly
americans
in
paris
that
sort
of
thing
i
served
the
tea
amid
their
babble
the
honourable
george
was
shown
up
a
bit
later
having
done
to
himself
quite
all
i
thought
he
might
in
the
matter
of
dress
in
spite
of
serious
discrepancies
in
his
attire
however
i
saw
that
effie
meant
to
lionize
him
tremendously
with
vast
ceremony
he
was
presented
to
her
guests
the
honourable
george
augustus
brother
of
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
the
women
fluttered
about
him
rather
though
he
behaved
moodily
and
at
the
first
opportunity
fell
to
the
tea
and
cakes
quite
wholeheartedly
in
spite
of
my
aversion
to
the
american
wilderness
i
felt
a
bit
of
professional
pride
in
reflecting
that
my
first
day
in
this
new
service
was
about
to
end
so
auspiciously
yet
even
in
that
moment
being
as
yet
unfamiliar
with
the
room
s
lesser
furniture
i
stumbled
slightly
against
a
hassock
hid
from
me
by
the
tray
i
carried
a
cup
of
tea
was
lost
though
my
recovery
was
quick
too
late
i
observed
that
the
hitherto
cousin
egbert
was
in
range
of
my
clumsiness
there
goes
tea
all
over
my
new
pants
he
said
in
a
high
pained
voice
sorry
indeed
sir
said
i
a
ready
napkin
in
hand
let
me
dry
it
sir
yes
sir
i
fancy
quite
so
sir
said
he
i
most
truly
would
have
liked
to
shake
him
smartly
for
this
i
saw
that
my
work
was
cut
out
for
me
among
these
americans
from
whom
at
their
best
one
expects
so
little
chapter
three
as
i
brisked
out
of
bed
the
following
morning
at
six
i
could
not
but
wonder
rather
nervously
what
the
day
might
have
in
store
for
me
i
was
obliged
to
admit
that
what
i
was
in
for
looked
a
bit
thick
as
i
opened
my
door
i
heard
stealthy
footsteps
down
the
hall
and
looked
out
in
time
to
observe
cousin
egbert
entering
his
own
room
it
was
not
this
that
startled
me
he
would
have
been
abroad
i
knew
for
the
ham
and
eggs
that
were
forbidden
him
yet
i
stood
aghast
for
with
the
of
tweeds
i
had
selected
the
day
before
he
had
worn
his
i
am
aware
that
these
things
i
relate
of
him
may
not
be
credited
i
can
only
put
them
down
in
all
sincerity
i
hastened
to
him
and
removed
the
thing
from
his
head
i
fear
it
was
not
with
the
utmost
deference
for
i
have
my
human
moments
it
s
not
done
sir
i
protested
he
saw
that
i
was
offended
all
right
sir
he
replied
meekly
but
how
was
i
to
know
i
thought
it
kind
of
set
me
he
referred
to
it
as
a
hat
i
knew
then
that
i
should
find
myself
overlooking
many
things
in
him
he
was
not
a
person
one
could
be
stern
with
and
i
even
promised
that
effie
should
not
be
told
of
his
offence
he
promising
in
turn
never
again
to
stir
abroad
without
first
submitting
himself
to
me
and
agreeing
also
to
wear
from
that
day
forth
i
saw
indeed
that
diplomacy
might
work
wonders
with
him
at
breakfast
in
the
during
which
cousin
egbert
earned
warm
praise
from
effie
for
his
lack
of
appetite
he
winking
violently
at
me
during
this
i
learned
that
i
should
be
expected
to
accompany
him
to
a
certain
art
gallery
which
corresponds
to
our
british
museum
i
was
a
bit
surprised
indeed
to
learn
that
he
largely
spent
his
days
there
and
was
accustomed
to
make
notes
of
the
various
objects
of
interest
i
insisted
explained
effie
that
he
should
absorb
all
the
culture
he
could
on
his
trip
abroad
so
i
got
him
a
notebook
in
which
he
puts
down
his
impressions
and
i
must
say
he
s
done
fine
some
of
his
remarks
are
so
good
that
when
he
gets
home
i
may
have
him
read
a
paper
before
our
onwards
and
upwards
cousin
egbert
wriggled
modestly
at
this
and
said
shucks
which
i
took
to
be
a
term
of
deprecation
you
needn
t
pretend
said
effie
just
let
ruggles
here
look
over
some
of
the
notes
you
have
made
and
she
handed
me
a
notebook
of
ruled
paper
in
which
there
was
a
deal
of
writing
i
glanced
as
bidden
at
one
or
two
of
the
paragraphs
and
confess
that
i
too
was
amazed
at
the
fluency
and
insight
displayed
along
lines
in
which
i
should
have
thought
the
man
entirely
uninformed
this
choice
work
represents
the
first
or
formative
period
of
the
master
began
one
note
but
distinctly
foreshadows
that
later
method
which
made
him
at
once
the
hope
and
despair
of
his
contemporaries
in
the
portrait
of
the
artist
by
himself
we
have
a
canvas
that
well
repays
patient
study
since
here
is
displayed
in
its
full
flower
that
ruthless
realism
happily
attenuated
by
a
superbly
subtle
delicacy
of
brush
work
it
was
really
quite
amazing
and
i
perceived
for
the
first
time
that
cousin
egbert
must
be
a
diamond
in
the
rough
as
the
saying
has
it
i
felt
indeed
that
i
would
be
very
pleased
to
accompany
him
on
one
of
his
instructive
strolls
through
this
gallery
for
i
have
always
been
of
a
studious
habit
and
anxious
to
improve
myself
in
the
fine
arts
you
see
asked
effie
when
i
had
perused
this
fragment
and
yet
folks
back
home
would
tell
you
that
he
s
just
a
cousin
egbert
here
coughed
alarmingly
no
matter
she
continued
he
ll
show
them
that
he
s
got
something
in
him
mark
my
quite
so
madam
i
said
and
i
shall
consider
it
a
privilege
to
be
present
when
he
further
prosecutes
his
art
you
may
keep
him
out
till
she
continued
i
m
shopping
this
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
i
shall
motor
to
have
tea
in
the
boy
with
the
senator
and
nevil
presently
then
my
charge
and
i
set
out
for
what
i
hoped
was
to
be
a
peaceful
and
instructive
day
among
objects
of
art
though
first
i
was
obliged
to
escort
him
to
a
hatter
s
and
glover
s
to
remedy
some
minor
discrepancies
in
his
attire
he
was
very
pleased
when
i
permitted
him
to
select
his
own
hat
i
was
safe
in
this
as
the
shop
was
really
artists
in
gentlemen
s
headwear
and
carried
only
shapes
i
observed
that
were
confined
to
exclusive
firms
so
as
to
insure
their
being
worn
by
the
right
set
as
to
gloves
and
a
stick
he
was
again
rather
pettish
and
had
to
be
set
right
with
some
firmness
he
declared
he
had
lost
his
stick
and
gloves
of
the
previous
day
i
discovered
later
that
he
had
presented
them
to
the
lift
attendant
but
i
soon
convinced
him
that
he
would
not
be
let
to
appear
without
these
adjuncts
to
a
gentleman
s
toilet
then
having
once
more
stood
by
at
the
barber
s
while
he
was
shaved
and
his
moustaches
firmly
waxed
anew
i
saw
that
he
was
fit
at
last
for
his
art
studies
the
barber
this
day
suggested
curling
the
moustaches
with
a
heated
iron
but
at
this
my
charge
fell
into
so
unseemly
a
rage
that
i
deemed
it
wise
not
to
insist
he
indeed
bluntly
threatened
a
nameless
violence
to
the
barber
if
he
were
so
much
as
touched
with
the
iron
and
revealed
an
altogether
shocking
gift
for
profanity
saying
loudly
i
ll
be
dashed
if
you
will
i
mean
to
say
i
have
written
dashed
for
what
he
actually
said
but
at
length
i
had
him
once
more
quieted
now
sir
i
said
when
i
had
got
him
from
the
barber
s
shop
to
the
barber
s
manifest
relief
i
fancy
we
ve
time
to
do
a
few
objects
of
art
before
luncheon
i
ve
the
book
here
for
your
comments
i
added
quite
so
he
replied
and
led
me
at
a
rapid
pace
along
the
street
in
what
i
presumed
was
the
direction
of
the
art
museum
at
the
end
of
a
few
blocks
he
paused
at
one
of
those
public
houses
that
disgracefully
line
the
streets
of
the
french
capital
i
mean
to
say
that
chairs
and
tables
are
set
out
upon
the
pavement
in
the
most
brazen
manner
and
occupied
by
the
populace
who
there
drink
their
silly
beverages
and
idle
away
their
time
after
scanning
the
score
or
so
of
persons
present
even
at
so
early
an
hour
as
ten
of
the
morning
he
fell
into
one
of
the
iron
chairs
at
one
of
the
iron
tables
and
motioned
me
to
another
at
his
side
when
i
had
seated
myself
he
said
beer
to
the
waiter
who
appeared
and
held
up
two
fingers
now
look
at
here
he
resumed
to
me
this
is
a
good
place
to
do
about
four
pages
of
art
and
then
we
can
go
out
and
have
some
recreation
seeing
that
i
was
puzzled
he
added
this
way
you
take
that
notebook
and
write
in
it
out
of
this
here
other
book
till
i
think
you
ve
done
enough
then
i
ll
tell
you
to
and
while
i
was
still
bewildered
he
drew
from
an
inner
pocket
a
small
volume
which
i
took
from
him
and
saw
to
be
entitled
one
hundred
masterpieces
of
the
open
her
about
the
middle
he
directed
and
pick
out
something
that
begins
good
like
here
the
true
will
stand
entranced
you
got
to
write
it
because
i
guess
you
can
write
faster
than
what
i
can
i
ll
tell
her
i
dictated
to
you
get
a
hustle
on
now
so
s
we
can
get
through
write
down
about
four
pages
of
that
stunned
i
was
for
a
moment
at
his
audacity
too
plainly
i
saw
through
his
deception
each
day
doubtless
he
had
come
to
a
low
place
of
this
sort
and
copied
into
the
notebook
from
the
printed
volume
but
sir
i
protested
why
not
at
least
go
to
the
gallery
where
these
art
objects
are
stored
copy
the
notes
there
if
that
must
be
i
don
t
know
where
the
darned
place
is
he
confessed
i
did
start
for
it
the
first
day
but
i
run
into
a
punch
and
judy
show
in
a
little
park
and
i
just
couldn
t
get
away
from
it
it
was
so
comical
with
all
the
french
kids
hollering
their
heads
off
at
it
anyway
what
s
the
use
i
d
rather
set
here
in
front
of
this
saloon
where
everything
is
it
s
very
extraordinary
sir
i
said
wondering
if
i
oughtn
t
to
cut
off
to
the
hotel
and
warn
effie
so
that
she
might
do
a
heated
foot
to
him
as
he
had
once
expressed
it
well
i
guess
i
ve
got
my
rights
as
well
as
anybody
he
insisted
i
ll
be
pushed
just
so
far
and
no
farther
not
if
i
never
get
any
more
cultured
than
a
and
now
you
better
go
on
and
write
or
i
ll
be
dashed
if
i
ll
ever
wear
another
thing
you
tell
me
he
had
a
most
bitter
and
dangerous
expression
on
his
face
so
i
thought
best
to
humour
him
once
more
accordingly
i
set
about
writing
in
his
notebook
from
the
volume
of
criticism
he
had
supplied
change
a
word
now
and
then
and
skip
around
here
and
there
he
suggested
as
i
wrote
so
s
it
ll
sound
more
like
quite
so
sir
i
said
and
continued
to
transcribe
from
the
printed
page
i
was
beginning
the
fifth
page
in
the
notebook
being
in
the
midst
of
an
enthusiastic
description
of
the
bit
of
statuary
entitled
the
winged
victory
when
i
was
startled
by
a
wild
yell
in
my
ear
cousin
egbert
had
leaped
to
his
feet
and
now
danced
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
waving
his
stick
and
hat
high
in
the
air
and
shouting
incoherently
at
once
we
attracted
the
most
undesirable
attention
from
the
loungers
about
us
the
waiters
and
the
in
the
street
many
of
whom
stopped
at
once
to
survey
my
charge
with
the
liveliest
interest
it
was
then
i
saw
that
he
had
merely
wished
to
attract
the
attention
of
some
one
passing
in
a
cab
half
a
block
down
the
boulevard
i
saw
a
man
likewise
waving
excitedly
standing
erect
in
the
cab
to
do
so
the
cab
thereupon
turned
sharply
came
back
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
crossed
over
to
us
and
the
occupant
alighted
he
was
an
american
as
one
might
have
fancied
from
his
behaviour
a
tall
person
wearing
a
drooping
moustache
after
the
former
style
of
cousin
egbert
supplemented
by
an
imperial
he
wore
a
suit
of
black
which
had
evidently
received
no
proper
attention
from
the
day
he
purchased
it
under
a
folded
collar
he
wore
a
narrow
cravat
tied
in
a
bowknot
and
in
the
bosom
of
his
white
shirt
there
sparkled
a
diamond
such
as
might
have
come
from
a
collection
of
this
much
i
had
time
to
notice
as
he
neared
us
cousin
egbert
had
not
ceased
to
shout
nor
had
he
paid
the
least
attention
to
my
tugs
at
his
coat
when
the
cab
s
occupant
descended
to
the
pavement
they
fell
upon
each
other
and
did
for
some
moments
a
wild
dance
such
as
i
imagine
they
might
have
seen
the
red
indians
of
western
america
perform
most
savagely
they
punched
each
other
calling
out
in
the
meantime
well
old
horse
and
who
d
ever
expected
to
see
you
here
darn
your
old
skin
their
actual
phrases
be
it
remembered
the
crowd
i
was
glad
to
note
fell
rapidly
away
many
of
them
shrugging
their
shoulders
in
a
way
the
french
have
and
even
the
waiters
about
us
quickly
lost
interest
in
the
pair
as
if
they
were
hardened
to
the
sight
of
americans
greeting
one
another
the
two
were
still
saying
well
well
rather
breathlessly
but
had
become
a
bit
more
coherent
jeff
tuttle

exclaimed
cousin
egbert

the
other

the

smart
blows

cousin

the
other

yesterday
say
what
you
all
rigged
out
like
that
for
and
what
you

to
your
face
cousin
egbert
here
turned
to
me
in
some
embarrassment
colonel
ruggles
shake
hands
with
my
friend
jeff
tuttle
from
the
state
of
pleased
to
meet
you
colonel
said
the
other
before
i
could
explain
that
i
had
no
military
title
whatever
never
having
in
fact
served
our
king
even
in
the
ranks
he
shook
my
hand
warmly
any
friend
of
floud
s
is
all
right
with
me
he
assured
me
what
s
the
matter
with
having
a
drink
say
listen
here
i
wouldn
t
have
to
be
blinded
and
backed
into
it
said
cousin
egbert
enigmatically
i
thought
but
as
they
sat
down
i
too
seated
myself
something
within
me
had
sounded
a
warning
as
well
as
i
know
it
now
i
knew
then
in
my
inmost
soul
that
i
should
summon
effie
before
matters
went
farther
beer
is
all
i
know
how
to
say
suggested
cousin
egbert
leave
that
to
me
said
his
new
friend
masterfully
where
s
the
boy
here
boy
that
s
french
for
he
explained
i
ve
had
to
pick
up
a
lot
of
their
cousin
egbert
looked
at
him
admiringly
good
old
jeff
he
said
simply
he
glanced
aside
to
me
for
a
second
with
downright
hostility
then
turned
back
to
his
friend
something
tells
me
jeff
that
this
is
going
to
be
the
first
happy
day
i
ve
had
since
i
crossed
the
state
line
i
ve
been
pestered
to
death
jeff
what
with
effie
after
me
to
improve
myself
so
s
i
can
be
a
social
credit
to
her
back
in
red
gap
and
learn
to
wear
clothes
and
go
without
my
breakfast
and
attend
art
galleries
if
you
d
stand
by
me
i
d
throw
her
down
good
and
hard
right
now
but
you
know
what
she
is
i
sure
do
put
in
tuttle
so
fervently
that
i
knew
he
spoke
the
truth
that
woman
can
bite
through
nails
but
here
s
your
drink
maybe
it
will
cheer
you
extraordinary
i
mean
to
say
biting
through
nails
three
rousing
cheers
exclaimed
cousin
egbert
with
more
animation
than
i
had
ever
known
him
display
here
s
looking
at
you
colonel
said
his
friend
to
me
whereupon
i
partook
of
the
drink
not
wishing
to
offend
him
decidedly
he
was
not
vogue
his
hat
was
remarkable
being
of
a
black
felt
with
high
crown
and
a
wide
and
flopping
brim
across
his
waistcoat
was
a
of
heavy
links
with
a
weighty
charm
consisting
of
a
sculptured
gold
horse
in
full
gallop
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
with
us
here
george
he
immediately
called
to
the
waiter
for
they
had
quickly
drained
their
glasses
tell
the
bartender
three
more
by
gosh
but
that
s
good
after
the
way
i
ve
been
held
me
too
said
cousin
egbert
i
didn
t
know
how
to
say
it
in
the
reverend
held
me

continued
the
tuttle
person

glass
of
native

i
says

and
then
stay
on
that
spot
i
may
want
well
well
said
cousin
egbert
again
as
if
the
meeting
were
still
incredible
you
old
responded
the
other
affectionately
the
cigars
were
brought
and
i
felt
constrained
to
light
one
the
state
of
washington
needn
t
ever
get
nervous
over
the
prospect
of
losing
me
said
the
tuttle
person
biting
off
the
end
of
his
cigar
i
gathered
at
once
that
the
americans
have
actually
named
one
of
our
colonies
washington
after
the
rebel
george
washington
though
one
would
have
thought
that
the
indelicacy
of
this
would
have
been
only
too
apparent
but
then
i
recalled
as
well
the
city
where
their
parliament
assembles
washington
doubtless
the
initials
indicate
that
it
was
named
in
honour
of
another
member
of
this
notorious
family
i
could
not
but
reflect
how
shocked
our
king
would
be
to
learn
of
this
effrontery
cousin
egbert
who
had
been
for
some
moments
moving
his
lips
without
sound
here
spoke
i
m
going
to
try
it
myself
he
said
here
charley
he
made
me
right
off
he
continued
as
the
waiter
disappeared
say
jeff
i
bet
i
could
have
learned
a
lot
of
this
language
if
i
d
had
some
one
like
you
well
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
the
accent
replied
the
other
with
a
modesty
which
i
could
detect
was
assumed
more
acutely
than
ever
was
i
conscious
of
a
psychic
warning
to
separate
these
two
and
i
resolved
to
act
upon
it
with
the
utmost
diplomacy
the
third
whiskey
and
soda
was
served
us
three
rousing
cheers
said
cousin
egbert
here
s
looking
at
you
said
the
other
and
i
drank
when
my
glass
was
drained
i
arose
briskly
and
said
i
think
we
should
be
getting
along
now
sir
if
tuttle
will
be
good
enough
to
excuse
they
both
stared
at
me
yes
sir
i
fancy
not
sir
said
cousin
egbert
stop
your
kidding
you
fat
rascal
said
the
other
old
bill
means
all
right
said
cousin
egbert
so
don
t
let
him
irritate
you
bill
s
our
new
hired
man
he
s
all
right
just
let
him
talk
can
t
he
talk
setting
down
asked
the
other
does
he
have
to
stand
up
every
time
he
talks
ain
t
that
a
good
chair
he
demanded
of
me
here
take
mine
and
to
my
great
embarrassment
he
arose
and
offered
me
his
chair
in
such
a
manner
that
i
felt
moved
to
accept
it
thereupon
he
took
the
chair
i
had
vacated
and
beamed
upon
us
now
that
we
re
all
together
once
more
i
would
suggest
a
bit
of
refreshment
boy
i
fancy
so
sir
said
cousin
egbert
dreamily
contemplating
me
as
the
order
was
served
i
was
conscious
even
then
that
he
seemed
to
be
studying
my
attire
with
a
critical
eye
and
indeed
he
remarked
as
if
to
himself
what
a
coat
i
was
rather
shocked
by
this
for
my
suit
was
quite
a
decent
that
had
become
too
snug
for
the
honourable
george
some
two
years
before
yet
something
warned
me
to
ignore
the
comment
three
rousing
cheers
he
said
as
the
drink
was
served
here
s
looking
at
you
said
the
tuttle
person
and
again
i
drank
with
them
against
my
better
judgment
wondering
if
i
might
escape
long
enough
to
be
put
through
to
floud
on
the
telephone
too
plainly
the
situation
was
rapidly
getting
out
of
hand
and
yet
i
hesitated
the
tuttle
person
under
an
exterior
geniality
was
rather
abrupt
and
moreover
i
now
recalled
having
observed
a
person
much
like
him
in
manner
and
attire
in
a
certain
cinema
drama
of
the
far
wild
west
he
had
been
a
constable
or
sheriff
in
the
piece
and
had
subdued
a
band
of
armed
border
ruffians
with
only
a
small
pocket
pistol
i
thought
it
as
well
not
to
cross
him
when
they
had
drunk
each
one
again
said
well
well
you
old
maverick
said
cousin
egbert
you
dashed
old
horned
toad
responded
his
friend
what
s
the
matter
with
a
little
snack
not
a
thing
on
earth
my
appetite
ain
t
been
so
powerful
craving
since
heck
was
a
these
were
their
actual
words
though
it
may
not
be
believed
the
tuttle
person
now
approached
his
cabman
who
had
waited
beside
the
curb
say
frank
he
began
ally
restorong
and
this
he
supplemented
with
a
crude
but
informing
pantomime
of
one
eating
cousin
egbert
was
already
seated
in
the
cab
and
i
could
do
nothing
but
follow
ally
restorong
commanded
our
new
friend
in
a
louder
tone
and
the
cabman
with
an
explosion
of
understanding
drove
rapidly
off
it
s
a
genuine
wonder
to
me
how
you
learned
the
language
so
quick
said
cousin
egbert
it
s
all
in
the
accent
protested
the
other
i
occupied
a
narrow
seat
in
the
front
facing
me
in
the
back
seat
they
lolled
easily
and
smoked
their
cigars
down
the
thronged
boulevard
we
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
and
were
passing
presently
before
an
immense
gray
edifice
which
i
recognized
as
the
louvre
from
its
illustration
on
the
cover
of
cousin
egbert
s
art
book
he
himself
regarded
it
with
interest
though
i
fancy
he
did
not
recognize
it
for
waving
his
cigar
toward
it
he
announced
to
his
friend
the
public
his
friend
surveyed
the
building
with
every
sign
of
approval
that
carnegie
is
a
hot
sport
all
right
he
declared
warmly
i
ll
bet
that
shack
set
him
back
three
rousing
cheers
said
cousin
egbert
without
point
that
i
could
detect
we
now
crossed
their
thames
over
what
would
have
been
westminster
bridge
i
fancy
and
were
presently
bowling
through
a
sort
of
battersea
part
of
the
city
the
streets
grew
quite
narrow
and
the
shops
smaller
and
i
found
myself
wondering
not
without
alarm
what
sort
of
restaurant
our
abrupt
friend
had
chosen
three
rousing
cheers
said
cousin
egbert
from
time
to
time
with
almost
childish
delight
debouching
from
a
narrow
street
again
into
what
the
french
term
a
boulevard
we
halted
before
what
was
indeed
a
restaurant
for
several
tables
were
laid
on
the
pavement
before
the
door
but
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
anything
but
a
nice
place
au
rendezvous
des
cochers
fideles
read
the
announcement
on
the
flap
of
the
awning
and
truly
enough
it
was
a
low
resort
frequented
by
cabbies
the
of
faithful
along
the
curb
half
a
score
of
horses
were
eating
from
their
bags
while
their
drivers
lounged
before
the
place
eating
drinking
and
conversing
excitedly
in
their
grotesque
jargon
we
descended
in
spite
of
the
repellent
aspect
of
the
place
and
our
driver
went
to
the
foot
of
the
line
where
he
fed
his
own
horse
cousin
egbert
already
at
one
of
the
tables
was
rapping
smartly
for
a
waiter
what
s
the
matter
with
having
just
one
little
one
before
grub
asked
the
tuttle
person
as
we
joined
him
he
had
a
most
curious
fashion
of
speech
i
mean
to
say
when
he
suggested
anything
whatsoever
he
invariably
wished
to
know
what
might
be
the
matter
with
it
demanded
cousin
egbert
of
the
serving
person
who
now
appeared
and
ask
your
driver
to
have
one
he
then
urged
his
friend
the
latter
hereupon
addressed
the
cabman
who
had
now
come
up
take
something
he
demanded
and
the
cabman
appeared
to
accept
your
friends
take
something
too
he
demanded
further
with
a
gesture
that
embraced
all
the
cabmen
present
and
these
too
appeared
to
accept
with
the
utmost
cordiality
you
re
a
wonder
jeff
said
cousin
egbert
you
talk
it
like
a
it
come
natural
to
me
said
the
fellow
and
it
s
a
good
thing
too
if
you
know
a
little
french
you
can
go
all
over
europe
without
a
bit
of
inside
the
place
was
all
activity
for
many
cabmen
were
now
accepting
the
proffered
hospitality
and
calling
votry
santy
to
their
host
who
seemed
much
pleased
then
to
my
amazement
cousin
egbert
insisted
that
our
cabman
should
sit
at
table
with
us
i
trust
i
have
as
little
foolish
pride
as
most
people
but
this
did
seem
like
crowding
it
on
a
bit
thick
in
fact
it
looked
rather
dicky
i
was
glad
to
remember
that
we
were
in
what
seemed
to
be
the
foreign
quarter
of
the
town
where
it
was
probable
that
no
one
would
recognize
us
the
drink
came
though
our
cabman
refused
the
whiskey
and
secured
a
bottle
of
native
wine
three
rousing
cheers
said
cousin
egbert
as
we
drank
once
more
and
added
as
an
afterthought
what
a
beautiful
world
we
live
in
bring
dinner
said
the
tuttle
person
to
the
cabman
who
thereupon
spoke
at
length
in
his
native
tongue
to
the
waiter
by
this
means
we
secured
a
soup
that
was
not
half
bad
and
presently
a
stew
of
mutton
which
cousin
egbert
declared
was
some
to
my
astonishment
i
ate
heartily
even
in
such
raffish
surroundings
in
fact
i
found
myself
pigging
it
with
the
rest
of
them
with
coffee
cigars
were
brought
from
the
tobacconist
s
each
cabman
present
accepting
one
our
own
man
was
plainly
feeling
a
vast
pride
in
his
party
and
now
circulated
among
his
fellows
with
an
account
of
our
merits
this
is
what
i
call
life
said
the
tuttle
person
leaning
back
in
his
chair
i
m
coming
right
back
here
every
day
declared
cousin
egbert
happily
what
s
the
matter
with
a
little
drive
to
see
some
objects
of
interest
inquired
his
friend
not
art
galleries
insisted
cousin
egbert
and
not
churches
said
his
friend
every
day
s
been
sunday
with
me
long
and
not
clothing
stores
said
cousin
egbert
firmly
the
colonel
here
is
awful
fussy
about
my
clothes
he
added
is
heh
inquired
his
friend
how
do
you
like
this
hat
of
mine
he
asked
turning
to
me
it
was
that
sudden
i
nearly
fluffed
the
catch
but
recovered
myself
in
time
i
should
consider
it
a
hat
of
sound
wearing
properties
sir
i
said
he
took
it
off
examined
it
carefully
and
replaced
it
so
far
so
good
he
said
gravely
but
why
be
fussy
about
clothes
when
god
has
given
you
only
one
life
to
live
don
t
argue
about
religion
warned
cousin
egbert
i
always
like
to
see
people
well
dressed
sir
i
said
because
it
makes
such
a
difference
in
their
he
slapped
his
thigh
fiercely
my
gosh
that
s
true
he
s
got
you
there
i
never
thought
of
he
makes
me
wear
these
on
my
ankles
said
cousin
egbert
bitterly
extending
one
foot
what
s
the
matter
of
taking
a
little
drive
to
see
some
objects
of
interest
said
his
friend
not
art
galleries
said
cousin
egbert
firmly
we
said
that
before
and
not
and
not
gents
furnishing
you
said
that
well
you
said
not
churches
well
what
s
the
matter
with
taking
a
little
drive
not
art
galleries
insisted
cousin
egbert
the
thing
seemed
interminable
i
mean
to
say
they
went
about
the
circle
as
before
it
looked
to
me
as
if
they
were
having
a
bit
of
a
spree
we
ll
have
one
last
drink
said
the
tuttle
person
no
said
cousin
egbert
firmly
not
another
drop
don
t
you
see
the
condition
poor
bill
here
is
in
to
my
amazement
he
was
referring
to
me
candidly
he
was
attempting
to
convey
the
impression
that
i
had
taken
a
drop
too
much
the
other
regarded
me
intently
pickled
he
said
always
affects
him
that
way
said
cousin
egbert
he
s
got
no
head
for
beg
pardon
sir
i
said
wishing
to
explain
but
this
i
was
not
let
to
do
don
t
start
anything
like
that
here
broke
in
the
tuttle
person
the
police
wouldn
t
stand
for
it
just
keep
quiet
and
remember
you
re
among
yes
sir
quite
so
sir
said
i
being
somewhat
puzzled
by
these
strange
words
i
was
merely
look
out
jeff
warned
cousin
egbert
interrupting
me
he
s
a
devil
when
he
have
you
got
a
knife
demanded
the
other
suddenly
i
fancy
so
sir
i
answered
and
produced
from
my
waistcoat
pocket
the
small
affair
i
have
long
carried
this
he
quickly
seized
from
me
you
can
keep
your
gun
he
remarked
but
you
can
t
be
trusted
with
this
in
your
condition
i
ain
t
afraid
of
a
gun
but
i
am
afraid
of
a
knife
you
could
have
backed
me
off
the
board
any
time
with
this
didn
t
i
tell
you
asked
cousin
egbert
beg
pardon
sir
i
began
for
this
was
drawing
it
quite
too
thick
but
again
he
interrupted
me
we
d
better
get
him
away
from
this
place
right
off
he
said
a
drive
in
the
fresh
air
might
fix
him
suggested
cousin
egbert
he
s
as
good
a
scout
as
you
want
to
know
when
he
s
hereupon
calling
our
waiting
cabman
they
both
to
my
embarrassment
assisted
me
to
the
vehicle
ally
caffy
directed
the
tuttle
person
and
we
were
driven
off
to
the
raised
hats
of
the
remaining
cabmen
through
many
long
quiet
streets
i
wouldn
t
have
had
this
happen
for
anything
said
cousin
egbert
indicating
me
lucky
i
got
that
knife
away
from
him
said
the
other
to
this
i
thought
it
best
to
remain
silent
it
being
plain
that
the
men
were
both
well
along
so
to
say
the
cab
now
approached
an
open
square
from
which
issued
discordant
blasts
of
music
one
glance
showed
it
to
be
a
street
fair
i
prayed
that
we
might
pass
it
but
my
companions
hailed
it
with
delight
and
at
once
halted
the
cabby
ally
caffy
on
the
corner
directed
the
tuttle
person
and
once
more
we
were
seated
at
an
iron
table
with
whiskey
and
soda
ordered
before
us
was
the
street
fair
in
all
its
silly
activity
there
were
many
tinselled
booths
at
which
games
of
chance
or
marksmanship
were
played
or
at
which
articles
of
ornament
or
household
decoration
were
displayed
for
sale
and
about
these
were
throngs
of
french
idling
away
their
afternoon
in
that
mad
pursuit
of
pleasure
which
is
so
characteristic
of
this
race
in
the
centre
of
the
place
was
a
carrousel
from
which
came
the
blare
of
a
steam
orchestrion
playing
the
marseillaise
one
of
their
popular
songs
from
where
i
sat
i
could
perceive
the
circle
of
gaudily
painted
beasts
that
revolved
about
this
musical
atrocity
a
fashion
of
horses
seemed
to
predominate
but
there
was
also
an
ostrich
a
bearded
frenchman
being
astride
this
bird
for
the
moment
a
zebra
a
lion
and
a
gaudily
emblazoned
giraffe
i
shuddered
as
i
thought
of
the
evil
possibilities
that
might
be
suggested
to
my
two
companions
by
this
affair
for
the
moment
i
was
pleased
to
note
that
they
had
forgotten
my
supposed
indisposition
yet
another
equally
absurd
complication
ensued
when
the
drink
arrived
say
don
t
your
friend
ever
loosen
up
asked
the
tuttle
person
of
cousin
egbert
tighter
than
dick
s
hatband
replied
the
latter
and
then
some
he
ain
t
bought
once
say
bo
he
continued
to
me
as
i
was
striving
to
divine
the
drift
of
these
comments
have
i
got
my
fingers
crossed
or
not
seeing
that
he
held
one
hand
behind
him
i
thought
to
humour
him
by
saying
i
fancy
so
he
means
yes
said
cousin
egbert
the
other
held
his
hand
before
me
with
the
first
two
fingers
spread
wide
apart
you
lost
he
said
how
s
that
we
stuck
him
the
first
rattle
out
of
the
good
work
said
cousin
egbert
you
re
stuck
for
this
round
he
added
to
me
three
rousing
cheers
i
readily
perceived
that
they
meant
me
to
pay
the
score
which
i
accordingly
did
though
i
at
once
suspected
the
fairness
of
the
game
i
mean
to
say
if
my
opponent
had
been
a
trickster
he
could
easily
have
rearranged
his
fingers
to
defeat
me
before
displaying
them
i
do
not
say
it
was
done
in
this
instance
i
am
merely
pointing
out
that
it
left
open
a
way
to
trickery
i
mean
to
say
one
would
wish
to
be
assured
of
his
opponent
s
social
standing
before
playing
this
game
extensively
no
sooner
had
we
finished
the
drink
than
the
tuttle
person
said
to
me
i
ll
give
you
one
chance
to
get
even
i
ll
guess
your
fingers
this
accordingly
i
put
one
hand
behind
me
and
firmly
crossed
the
fingers
fancying
that
he
would
guess
them
to
be
uncrossed
instead
of
which
he
called
out
crossed
and
i
was
obliged
to
show
them
in
that
wise
though
as
before
pointed
out
i
could
easily
have
defeated
him
by
uncrossing
them
before
revealing
my
hand
i
mean
to
say
it
is
not
on
the
face
of
it
a
game
one
would
care
to
play
with
casual
acquaintances
and
i
questioned
even
then
in
my
own
mind
its
prevalence
in
the
states
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
may
say
that
in
my
later
life
in
the
states
i
could
find
no
trace
of
it
and
now
believe
it
to
have
been
a
pure
invention
on
the
part
of
the
tuttle
person
i
mean
to
say
i
later
became
convinced
that
it
was
properly
speaking
not
a
game
at
all
again
they
were
hugely
delighted
at
my
loss
and
rapped
smartly
on
the
table
for
more
drink
and
now
to
my
embarrassment
i
discovered
that
i
lacked
the
money
to
pay
for
this
round
as
they
would
call
it
beg
pardon
sir
said
i
discreetly
to
cousin
egbert
but
if
you
could
let
me
have
a
bit
of
change
a
or
so
to
my
surprise
he
regarded
me
coldly
and
shook
his
head
emphatically
in
the
negative
not
me
he
said
i
ve
been
had
too
often
you
re
a
good
smooth
talker
and
you
may
be
all
right
but
i
can
t
take
a
chance
at
my
time
of
what
s
he
want
now
asked
the
other
the
old
story
said
cousin
egbert
come
off
and
left
his
purse
on
the
hatrack
or
out
in
the
woodshed
some
this
was
the
height
of
absurdity
for
i
had
said
nothing
of
the
sort
i
was
looking
for
something
like
that
said
the
other
i
never
make
a
mistake
in
faces
you
got
a
watch
there
haven
t
you
yes
sir
i
said
and
laid
on
the
table
my
silver
english
with
albert
they
both
fell
to
examining
this
with
interest
and
presently
the
tuttle
person
spoke
up
excitedly
well
darn
my
skin
if
he
ain
t
got
a
genuine
double
gazottz
how
did
you
come
by
this
my
man
he
demanded
sharply
it
came
from
my
sir
i
explained
six
years
ago
as
security
for
a
trifling
he
sounds
honest
enough
said
the
tuttle
person
to
cousin
egbert
yes
but
maybe
it
ain
t
a
regular
double
gazottz
said
the
latter
the
market
is
flooded
with
no
sir
i
can
t
be
fooled
on
them
boys
insisted
the
other
blindfold
me
and
i
could
pick
a
double
gazottz
out
every
time
i
m
going
to
take
a
chance
on
it
whereupon
the
fellow
pocketed
my
watch
and
from
his
wallet
passed
me
a
note
of
the
french
money
which
i
was
astounded
to
observe
was
for
the
equivalent
of
four
pounds
or
one
hundred
francs
as
the
french
will
have
it
i
ll
advance
that
much
on
it
he
said
but
don
t
ask
for
another
cent
until
i
ve
had
it
thoroughly
gone
over
by
a
plumber
it
may
have
moths
in
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
chap
was
quite
off
his
head
for
the
watch
was
worth
not
more
than
ten
shillings
at
the
most
though
what
a
double
gazottz
might
be
i
could
not
guess
however
i
saw
it
would
be
wise
to
appear
to
accept
the
loan
and
tendered
the
note
in
payment
of
the
score
when
i
had
secured
the
change
i
sought
to
intimate
that
we
should
be
leaving
i
thought
even
the
street
fair
would
be
better
for
us
than
this
rapid
consumption
of
stimulants
i
bet
he
d
go
without
buying
said
cousin
egbert
no
he
wouldn
t
said
the
other
he
knows
what
s
customary
in
a
case
like
this
he
s
just
a
little
embarrassed
wait
and
see
if
i
ain
t
at
which
they
both
sat
and
stared
at
me
in
silence
for
some
moments
until
at
last
i
ordered
more
drink
as
i
saw
was
expected
of
me
he
wants
the
cabman
to
have
one
with
him
said
cousin
egbert
whereat
the
other
not
only
beckoned
our
cabby
to
join
us
but
called
to
two
labourers
who
were
passing
and
also
induced
the
waiter
who
served
us
to
join
in
the
he
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
tough
friends
said
cousin
egbert
as
we
all
drank
though
he
well
knew
i
had
extended
none
of
these
invitations
acts
like
a
drunken
sailor
soon
as
he
gets
a
little
money
said
the
other
three
rousing
cheers
replied
cousin
egbert
and
to
my
great
chagrin
he
leaped
to
his
feet
seized
one
of
the
navvies
about
the
waist
and
there
on
the
public
pavement
did
a
crude
dance
with
him
to
the
strain
of
the
marseillaise
from
the
steam
orchestrion
not
only
this
but
when
the
music
had
ceased
he
traded
hats
with
the
navvy
securing
a
most
shocking
affair
in
place
of
the
new
one
and
as
they
parted
he
presented
the
fellow
with
the
gloves
and
stick
i
had
purchased
for
him
that
very
morning
as
i
stared
aghast
at
this
the
navvy
with
his
new
hat
at
an
angle
and
twirling
the
stick
proceeded
down
the
street
with
mincing
steps
and
exaggerated
airs
of
gentility
to
the
applause
of
the
entire
crowd
including
cousin
egbert
this
ain
t
quite
the
hat
i
want
he
said
as
he
returned
to
us
but
the
day
is
young
i
ll
have
other
chances
and
with
the
help
of
the
window
as
a
mirror
he
adjusted
the
unmentionable
thing
with
affectations
of
great
nicety
he
always
was
a
dressy
old
scoundrel
remarked
the
tuttle
person
and
then
as
the
music
came
to
us
once
more
he
continued
say
let
s
go
over
to
the
rodeo
they
got
some
likely
looking
broncs
over
arm
in
arm
accordingly
they
crossed
the
street
and
proceeded
to
the
carrousel
first
warning
the
cabby
and
myself
to
stay
by
them
lest
harm
should
come
to
us
what
now
ensued
was
perhaps
their
most
remarkable
behaviour
at
the
day
at
the
time
i
could
account
for
it
only
by
the
liquor
they
had
consumed
but
later
experience
in
the
states
convinced
me
that
they
were
at
times
consciously
spoofing
i
mean
to
say
it
was
quite
too
absurd
their
seriously
believing
what
they
seemed
to
believe
the
carrousel
being
at
rest
when
we
approached
they
gravely
examined
each
one
of
the
painted
wooden
effigies
looking
into
such
of
the
mouths
as
were
open
and
cautiously
feeling
the
forelegs
of
the
different
mounts
keeping
up
an
elaborate
pretence
the
while
that
the
beasts
were
real
and
that
they
were
in
danger
of
being
kicked
one
absurdly
painted
horse
they
agreed
would
be
the
most
difficult
to
ride
examining
his
mouth
they
disputed
as
to
his
age
and
called
the
cabby
to
have
his
opinion
of
the
thing
s
fetlocks
warning
each
other
to
beware
of
his
rearing
the
cabby
who
was
doubtless
also
intoxicated
made
an
equal
pretence
of
the
beast
s
realness
and
indulged
i
gathered
in
various
criticisms
of
its
legs
at
great
length
i
think
he
s
right
remarked
the
tuttle
person
when
the
cabby
had
finished
it
s
a
bad
case
of
splints
the
leg
would
be
blistered
if
i
had
i
wouldn
t
give
him
corral
room
said
cousin
egbert
he
s
a
bad
actor
look
at
his
eye
whoa
there
you
would
would
you
here
he
made
a
pretence
that
the
beast
had
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
he
s
a
what
did
i
tell
you
keep
him
away
i
ll
take
that
out
of
him
said
the
tuttle
person
i
ll
show
him
who
s
his
you
ain
t
never
going
to
try
to
ride
him
jeff
think
of
the
wife
and
little
ones
you
know
me
no
horse
never
stepped
out
from
under
me
yet
i
ll
not
only
ride
him
but
i
ll
put
a
silver
dollar
in
each
stirrup
and
give
you
a
thousand
for
each
one
i
lose
and
a
thousand
for
every
time
i
touch
cousin
egbert
here
began
to
plead
tearfully
don
t
do
it
jeff
come
on
around
here
there
s
a
big
roan
around
here
that
will
be
safe
as
a
church
for
you
let
that
pinto
alone
they
ought
to
be
arrested
for
having
him
but
the
other
seemed
obdurate
start
her
up
professor
when
i
give
the
word
he
called
to
the
proprietor
and
handed
him
one
of
the
french
banknotes
play
it
all
out
he
directed
as
this
person
gasped
with
amazement
cousin
egbert
then
proceeded
to
the
head
of
the
beast
you
ll
have
to
blind
him
he
said
sure
replied
the
other
and
with
loud
and
profane
cries
to
the
animal
they
bound
a
handkerchief
about
his
eyes
i
can
tell
he
s
going
to
be
a
twister
warned
cousin
egbert
i
better
ear
him
and
to
my
increased
amazement
he
took
one
of
the
beast
s
leather
ears
between
his
teeth
and
held
it
tightly
then
with
soothing
words
to
the
supposedly
dangerous
animal
the
tuttle
person
mounted
him
let
him
go
he
called
to
cousin
egbert
who
released
the
ear
from
between
his
teeth
wait
called
the
latter
we
re
all
going
with
you
whereupon
he
insisted
that
the
cabby
and
i
should
enter
a
sort
of
directly
in
the
rear
i
felt
a
silly
fool
but
i
saw
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
cousin
egbert
himself
mounted
a
horse
he
had
called
a
blue
roan
waved
his
hand
to
the
proprietor
who
switched
a
lever
the
marseillaise
blared
forth
and
the
platform
began
to
revolve
as
we
moved
the
tuttle
person
whisked
the
handkerchief
from
off
the
eyes
of
his
mount
and
with
loud
shrill
cries
began
to
beat
the
sides
of
its
head
with
his
soft
hat
bobbing
about
in
his
saddle
moreover
as
if
the
beast
were
most
unruly
and
like
to
dismount
him
cousin
egbert
joined
in
the
yelling
i
am
sorry
to
say
and
lashed
his
beast
as
if
he
would
overtake
his
companion
the
cabman
also
became
excited
and
shouted
his
utmost
apparently
in
the
way
of
encouragement
strange
to
say
i
presume
on
account
of
the
motion
i
felt
the
thing
was
becoming
infectious
and
was
absurdly
moved
to
join
in
the
shouts
restraining
myself
with
difficulty
i
could
distinctly
imagine
we
were
in
the
hunting
field
and
riding
the
tails
off
the
hounds
as
one
might
say
in
view
of
what
was
later
most
unjustly
alleged
of
me
i
think
it
as
well
to
record
now
that
though
i
had
partaken
freely
of
the
stimulants
since
our
meeting
with
the
tuttle
person
i
was
not
intoxicated
nor
until
this
moment
had
i
felt
even
the
slightest
elation
now
however
i
did
begin
to
feel
conscious
of
a
mild
exhilaration
and
to
be
aware
that
i
was
viewing
the
behaviour
of
my
companions
with
a
sort
of
superior
but
amused
tolerance
i
can
account
for
this
only
by
supposing
that
the
swift
revolutions
of
the
carrousel
had
in
some
occult
manner
intensified
or
consummated
as
one
might
say
the
effect
of
my
previous
potations
i
mean
to
say
the
continued
swirling
about
gave
me
a
frothy
feeling
that
was
not
unpleasant
as
the
contrivance
came
to
rest
cousin
egbert
ran
to
the
tuttle
person
who
had
dismounted
and
warmly
shook
his
hand
as
did
the
cabby
i
certainly
thought
he
had
you
there
once
jeff
said
cousin
egbert
of
all
the
twisters
i
ever
saw
that
outlaw
is
the
wanted
to
roll
me
said
the
other
but
i
learned
him
it
may
not
be
credited
but
at
this
moment
i
found
myself
examining
the
beast
and
saying
he
s
crocked
himself
up
sir
he
s
gone
tender
at
the
i
knew
perfectly
it
must
be
understood
that
this
was
silly
and
yet
i
further
added
i
fancy
he
s
picked
up
a
i
mean
to
say
it
was
the
most
utter
rot
pretending
seriously
that
way
you
come
away
said
cousin
egbert
next
thing
you
ll
be
thinking
you
can
ride
him
i
did
in
truth
experience
an
earnest
craving
for
more
of
the
revolutions
and
said
as
much
adding
that
i
rode
at
twelve
stone
let
him
break
his
neck
if
he
wants
to
urged
the
tuttle
person
it
wouldn
t
be
right
replied
cousin
egbert
not
in
his
condition
let
s
see
if
we
can
t
find
something
gentle
for
him
not
the
roan
i
found
she
ain
t
how
about
that
pheasant
it
s
an
ostrich
sir
i
corrected
him
as
indeed
it
most
distinctly
was
though
at
my
words
they
both
indulged
in
loud
laughter
affecting
to
consider
that
i
had
misnamed
the
creature
ostrich
they
shouted
poor
old
bill
he
thinks
it
s
an
ostrich
quite
so
sir
i
said
pleasantly
but
firmly
determining
not
to
be
hoaxed
again
don
t
drivel
that
way
said
the
tuttle
person
leave
it
to
the
driver
jeff
maybe
he
ll
believe
said
cousin
egbert
almost
sadly
whereupon
the
other
addressed
the
cabby
hey
frank
he
began
and
continued
with
some
french
words
among
which
i
caught
ally
caffy
foomer
and
something
that
sounded
much
like
kafoozleum
at
which
the
cabby
spoke
at
some
length
in
his
native
language
concerning
the
ostrich
when
he
had
done
the
tuttle
person
turned
to
me
with
a
superior
frown
now
i
guess
you
re
satisfied
he
remarked
you
heard
what
frank
said
it
s
an
arabian
muffin
of
course
i
was
perfectly
certain
that
the
chap
had
said
nothing
of
the
sort
but
i
resolved
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
so
i
merely
said
yes
sir
my
error
it
was
only
at
first
glance
that
it
seemed
to
be
an
come
along
said
cousin
egbert
i
won
t
let
him
ride
anything
he
can
t
guess
the
name
of
it
wouldn
t
be
right
to
his
well
what
s
that
then
demanded
the
other
pointing
full
at
the
giraffe
it
s
a
bally
sir
i
replied
divining
that
i
should
be
wise
not
to
seem
too
obvious
in
naming
the
beast
well
well
so
it
is
exclaimed
the
tuttle
person
delightedly
he
s
got
the
eye
with
him
this
time
said
cousin
egbert
admiringly
he
s
sure
a
wonder
said
the
other
that
thing
had
me
fooled
i
thought
at
first
it
was
a
russian
mouse
well
let
him
ride
it
then
said
cousin
egbert
and
i
was
practically
lifted
into
the
saddle
by
the
pair
of
them
one
moment
said
cousin
egbert
can
t
you
see
the
poor
thing
has
a
sore
throat
wait
till
i
fix
and
forthwith
he
removed
his
spats
and
in
another
moment
had
buckled
them
securely
high
about
the
throat
of
the
giraffe
it
will
be
seen
that
i
was
not
myself
when
i
say
that
this
performance
did
not
shock
me
as
it
should
have
done
though
i
was
of
course
less
entertained
by
it
than
were
the
remainder
of
our
party
and
a
circle
of
the
french
lower
classes
that
had
formed
about
us
give
him
his
head
let
s
see
what
time
you
can
make
shouted
cousin
egbert
as
the
affair
began
once
more
to
revolve
i
saw
that
both
my
companions
held
opened
watches
in
their
hands
it
here
becomes
difficult
for
me
to
be
lucid
about
the
succeeding
events
of
the
day
i
was
conscious
of
a
mounting
exhilaration
as
my
beast
swept
me
around
the
circle
and
of
a
marked
impatience
with
many
of
the
proprieties
of
behaviour
that
ordinarily
with
me
matter
enormously
i
swung
my
cap
and
joyously
urged
my
strange
steed
to
a
faster
pace
being
conscious
of
loud
applause
each
time
i
passed
my
companions
for
certain
lapses
of
memory
thereafter
i
must
wholly
blame
this
insidious
motion
for
example
though
i
believed
myself
to
be
still
mounted
and
whirling
indeed
i
was
strongly
aware
of
the
motion
i
found
myself
seated
again
at
the
corner
public
house
and
rapping
smartly
for
drink
which
i
paid
for
i
was
feeling
remarkably
fit
and
suffered
only
a
mild
wonder
that
i
should
have
left
the
carrousel
without
observing
it
having
drained
my
glass
i
then
remember
asking
cousin
egbert
if
he
would
consent
to
change
hats
with
the
cabby
which
he
willingly
did
it
was
a
of
some
strange
hard
material
brightly
glazed
although
many
unjust
things
were
said
of
me
later
this
is
the
sole
incident
of
the
day
which
causes
me
to
admit
that
i
might
have
taken
a
glass
too
much
especially
as
i
undoubtedly
praised
cousin
egbert
s
appearance
when
the
exchange
had
been
made
and
was
heard
to
wish
that
we
might
all
have
hats
so
smart
it
was
directly
after
this
that
young
elmer
the
art
student
invited
us
to
his
studio
though
i
had
not
before
remarked
his
presence
and
can
not
recall
now
where
we
met
him
the
occurrence
in
the
studio
however
was
entirely
natural
i
wished
to
please
my
friends
and
made
no
demur
whatever
when
asked
to
don
the
things
a
trouserish
affair
of
sheep
s
wool
which
they
called
chapps
a
flannel
shirt
of
blue
they
knotted
a
scarlet
handkerchief
around
my
neck
and
a
white
hat
with
four
indentations
in
the
crown
such
as
one
may
see
worn
in
the
cinema
dramas
by
and
other
desperadoes
when
they
had
strapped
around
my
waist
a
large
pistol
in
a
leather
jacket
i
considered
the
effect
picturesque
in
the
extreme
and
my
friends
were
loud
in
their
approval
of
it
i
repeat
it
was
an
occasion
when
it
would
have
been
boorish
in
me
to
refuse
to
meet
them
halfway
i
even
told
them
an
excellent
wheeze
i
had
long
known
which
i
thought
they
might
not
have
heard
it
runs
why
is
charing
cross
because
the
strand
runs
into
i
mean
to
say
this
is
comic
providing
one
enters
wholly
into
the
spirit
of
it
as
there
is
required
a
certain
nimbleness
of
mind
to
get
the
point
as
one
might
say
in
the
present
instance
some
needed
element
was
lacking
for
they
actually
drew
aloof
from
me
and
conversed
in
low
tones
among
themselves
pointedly
ignoring
me
i
repeated
the
thing
to
make
sure
they
should
see
it
whereat
i
heard
cousin
egbert
say
better
not
irritate
him
he
ll
get
mad
if
we
don
t
laugh
after
which
they
burst
into
laughter
so
extravagant
that
i
knew
it
to
be
feigned
hereupon
feeling
quite
drowsy
i
resolved
to
have
forty
winks
and
with
due
apologies
reclined
upon
the
couch
where
i
drifted
into
a
refreshing
slumber
later
i
inferred
that
i
must
have
slept
for
some
hours
i
was
awakened
by
a
light
flashed
in
my
eyes
and
beheld
cousin
egbert
and
the
tuttle
person
the
latter
wishing
to
know
how
late
i
expected
to
keep
them
up
i
was
on
my
feet
at
once
with
apologies
but
they
instantly
hustled
me
to
the
door
down
a
flight
of
steps
through
a
and
into
the
waiting
cab
it
was
then
i
noticed
that
i
was
wearing
the
curious
hat
of
the
american
but
when
i
would
have
gone
back
to
leave
it
and
secure
my
own
they
protested
vehemently
wishing
to
know
if
i
had
not
given
them
trouble
enough
that
day
in
the
cab
i
was
still
somewhat
drowsy
but
gathered
that
my
companions
had
left
me
to
dine
and
attend
a
public
with
the
cubbish
art
student
they
had
not
seemed
to
need
sleep
and
were
still
wakeful
for
they
sang
from
time
to
time
and
cousin
egbert
lifted
the
cabby
s
hat
which
he
still
wore
bowing
to
imaginary
throngs
along
the
street
who
were
supposed
to
be
applauding
him
i
at
once
became
at
the
thought
of
effie
s
feelings
when
she
should
discover
him
to
be
in
this
state
and
was
on
the
point
of
suggesting
that
he
seek
another
apartment
for
the
night
when
the
cab
pulled
up
in
front
of
our
own
hotel
though
i
protest
that
i
was
now
entirely
recovered
from
any
effect
that
the
alcohol
might
have
had
upon
me
it
was
not
until
this
moment
that
i
most
horribly
discovered
myself
to
be
in
the
full
s
regalia
i
had
donned
in
the
studio
in
a
spirit
of
pure
frolic
i
mean
to
say
i
had
never
intended
to
wear
the
things
beyond
the
door
and
could
not
have
been
hired
to
do
so
what
was
my
amazement
then
to
find
my
companions
laboriously
lifting
me
from
the
cab
in
this
impossible
tenue
i
objected
vehemently
but
little
good
it
did
me
get
a
policeman
if
he
starts
any
of
that
rough
stuff
said
the
tuttle
person
and
in
sheer
horror
of
a
scandal
i
subsided
while
one
on
either
side
they
hustled
me
through
the
hotel
lounge
happily
vacant
of
every
one
but
a
tariff
manager
and
into
the
lift
and
now
i
perceived
that
they
were
once
more
pretending
to
themselves
that
i
was
in
a
bad
way
from
drink
though
i
could
not
at
once
suspect
the
full
iniquity
of
their
design
as
we
reached
our
own
floor
one
of
them
still
seeming
to
support
me
on
either
side
they
began
loud
and
excited
admonitions
to
me
to
be
still
to
come
along
as
quickly
as
possible
to
stop
singing
and
not
to
shoot
i
mean
to
say
i
was
entirely
quiet
i
was
coming
along
as
quickly
as
they
would
let
me
i
had
not
sung
and
did
not
wish
to
shoot
yet
they
persisted
in
making
this
loud
ado
over
my
supposed
intoxication
aimlessly
as
i
thought
until
the
door
of
the
floud
opened
and
effie
appeared
in
the
hallway
at
this
they
redoubled
their
absurd
violence
with
me
and
by
dint
of
tripping
me
they
actually
made
it
appear
that
i
was
scarce
able
to
walk
nor
do
i
imagine
that
the
costume
i
wore
was
any
testimonial
to
my
sobriety
now
we
got
him
safe
panted
cousin
egbert
pushing
open
the
door
of
my
room
get
his
gun
first
warned
the
tuttle
person
and
this
being
taken
from
me
i
was
unceremoniously
shoved
inside
what
does
all
this
mean
demanded
effie
coming
rapidly
down
the
hall
where
have
you
been
till
this
time
of
night
i
bet
it
s
your
fault
jeff
tuttle
you
ve
been
getting
him
they
were
both
voluble
with
denials
of
this
and
though
i
could
scarce
believe
my
ears
they
proceeded
to
tell
a
story
that
laid
the
blame
entirely
on
me
no
ma
am
mis
effie
began
the
tuttle
person
it
ain
t
that
way
at
all
you
wrong
me
if
ever
a
man
was
you
just
seen
what
state
he
was
in
didn
t
you
asked
cousin
egbert
in
tones
of
deep
injury
do
you
want
to
take
another
look
at
him
and
he
made
as
if
to
push
the
door
farther
open
upon
me
don
t
do
it
don
t
get
him
started
again
warned
the
tuttle
person
i
ve
had
trouble
enough
with
that
man
i
seen
it
coming
this
morning
said
cousin
egbert
when
we
was
at
the
art
gallery
he
had
a
kind
of
wild
look
in
his
eyes
and
i
says
right
then
there
s
a
man
ought
to
be
watched
and
well
one
thing
led
to
another
look
at
this
hat
he
made
me
wear
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
i
should
trade
hats
with
some
i
was
coming
along
from
looking
at
two
or
three
good
churches
broke
in
the
tuttle
person
when
i
seen
here
having
a
kind
of
a
with
this
man
because
of
him
insisting
he
must
ride
a
kangaroo
or
something
on
a
and
wanting
to
ride
an
ostrich
with
him
and
then
when
we
got
him
quieted
down
a
little
nothing
would
do
him
but
he
s
got
to
be
a
cowboy
you
seen
his
clothes
didn
t
you
and
of
course
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
addie
and
the
girls
but
i
seen
here
was
in
trouble
so
i
stayed
right
by
him
and
between
us
we
got
the
maniac
he
s
one
of
them
should
never
touch
liquor
said
cousin
egbert
it
makes
a
demon
of
i
got
his
knife
away
from
him
early
in
the
game
said
the
other
i
don
t
suppose
i
got
to
wear
this
cabman
s
hat
just
because
he
told
me
to
have
i
demanded
cousin
egbert
and
here
i
d
been
looking
forward
to
a
quiet
day
seeing
some
objects
of
interest
came
from
the
other
after
i
got
my
tooth
pulled
that
and
me
with
a
tooth
too
that
nearly
drove
me
out
of
my
mind
said
cousin
egbert
suddenly
i
could
not
see
effie
but
she
had
evidently
listened
to
this
outrageous
tale
with
more
or
less
belief
though
not
wholly
credulous
you
men
have
both
been
drinking
yourselves
she
said
shrewdly
we
had
to
take
a
little
he
made
us
declared
the
tuttle
person
brazenly
he
got
so
he
insisted
on
our
taking
something
every
time
he
did
added
cousin
egbert
and
anyway
i
didn
t
care
so
much
with
this
tooth
of
mine
aching
like
it
you
come
right
out
with
me
and
around
to
that
dentist
i
went
to
this
morning
said
the
tuttle
person
you
ll
suffer
all
night
if
you
don
maybe
i
d
better
said
cousin
egbert
though
i
hate
to
leave
this
comfortable
hotel
and
go
out
into
the
night
air
i
ll
have
the
right
of
this
in
the
morning
said
effie
don
t
think
it
s
going
to
stop
here
at
this
my
door
was
pulled
to
and
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
frankly
i
am
aware
that
what
i
have
put
down
above
is
incredible
yet
not
a
single
detail
have
i
distorted
with
a
quite
devilish
ingenuity
they
had
fastened
upon
some
true
bits
i
had
suggested
the
change
of
hats
with
the
cabby
i
had
wished
to
ride
the
giraffe
and
the
tuttle
person
had
secured
my
knife
but
how
monstrously
untrue
of
me
was
the
impression
conveyed
by
these
isolated
facts
i
could
believe
now
quite
all
the
tales
i
had
ever
heard
of
the
queerness
of
americans
queerness
indeed
i
went
to
bed
resolving
to
let
the
morrow
take
care
of
itself
again
i
was
awakened
by
a
light
flashing
in
my
eyes
and
became
aware
that
cousin
egbert
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
was
reading
from
his
notebook
of
art
criticisms
with
something
of
an
oratorical
effect
through
the
curtains
i
could
see
that
dawn
was
breaking
cousin
egbert
was
no
longer
wearing
the
cabby
s
hat
it
was
now
the
flat
cap
of
the
paris
constable
or
policeman
chapter
four
the
sight
was
a
fair
crumpler
after
the
outrageous
slander
that
had
been
put
upon
me
by
this
elderly
inebriate
and
his
accomplice
i
sat
up
at
once
prepared
to
bully
him
down
a
bit
although
i
was
not
sure
that
i
engaged
his
attention
i
told
him
that
his
reading
could
be
very
well
done
without
and
that
he
might
take
himself
off
at
this
he
became
silent
and
regarded
me
solemnly
why
did
charing
cross
the
strand
because
three
rousing
cheers
said
he
of
course
he
had
the
wheeze
all
wrong
and
i
saw
that
he
should
be
in
bed
so
with
gentle
words
i
lured
him
to
his
own
chamber
here
with
a
quite
unexpected
perversity
he
accused
me
of
having
kept
him
up
the
night
long
and
begged
now
to
be
allowed
to
retire
this
he
did
with
muttered
complaints
of
my
behaviour
and
was
almost
instantly
asleep
i
concealed
the
constable
s
cap
in
one
of
his
boxes
for
i
feared
that
he
had
not
come
by
this
honestly
i
then
returned
to
my
own
room
where
for
a
long
time
i
meditated
profoundly
upon
the
situation
that
now
confronted
me
it
seemed
probable
that
i
should
be
shopped
by
effie
for
what
she
had
been
led
to
believe
was
my
rowdyish
behaviour
however
dastardly
the
injustice
to
me
it
was
a
solution
of
the
problem
that
i
saw
i
could
bring
myself
to
meet
with
considerable
philosophy
it
meant
a
return
to
the
quiet
service
of
the
honourable
george
and
that
i
need
no
longer
face
the
distressing
vicissitudes
of
life
in
the
back
blocks
of
unexplored
america
i
would
not
be
obliged
to
muddle
along
in
the
blind
fashion
of
the
last
two
days
feeling
a
frightful
fool
effie
would
surely
not
keep
me
on
and
that
was
all
about
it
i
had
merely
to
make
no
defence
of
myself
and
even
if
i
chose
to
make
one
i
was
not
certain
that
she
would
believe
me
so
cunning
had
been
the
accusations
against
me
with
that
tiny
thread
of
fact
which
i
make
no
doubt
has
so
often
enabled
historians
to
give
a
false
colouring
to
their
recitals
without
stating
downright
untruths
indeed
my
shameless
appearance
in
the
garb
of
a
cow
person
would
alone
have
cast
doubt
upon
the
truth
as
i
knew
it
to
be
then
suddenly
i
suffered
an
illumination
i
perceived
all
at
once
that
to
make
any
sort
of
defence
of
myself
would
not
be
cricket
i
mean
to
say
i
saw
the
proceedings
of
the
previous
day
in
a
new
light
it
is
well
known
that
i
do
not
hold
with
the
abuse
of
alcoholic
stimulants
and
yet
on
the
day
before
in
moments
that
i
now
confess
to
have
been
slightly
elevated
i
had
been
conscious
of
a
certain
feeling
of
fellowship
with
my
two
companions
that
was
rather
wonderful
though
obviously
they
were
not
university
men
they
seemed
to
belong
to
what
in
america
would
be
called
the
landed
gentry
and
yet
i
had
felt
myself
on
terms
of
undoubted
equality
with
them
it
may
be
believed
or
not
but
there
had
been
brief
spaces
when
i
forgot
that
i
was
a
gentleman
s
man
astoundingly
i
had
experienced
the
confident
ease
of
a
gentleman
among
his
equals
i
was
obliged
to
admit
now
that
this
might
have
been
a
mere
delusion
of
the
cup
and
yet
i
wondered
too
if
perchance
i
might
not
have
caught
something
of
that
american
spirit
of
equality
which
is
said
to
be
peculiar
to
republics
needless
to
say
i
had
never
believed
in
the
existence
of
this
spirit
but
had
considered
it
rather
a
ghastly
jest
having
been
a
reader
of
our
own
periodical
press
since
earliest
youth
i
mean
to
say
there
could
hardly
be
a
stable
society
in
which
one
had
no
superiors
because
in
that
case
one
would
not
know
who
were
one
s
inferiors
nevertheless
i
repeat
that
i
had
felt
a
most
novel
enlargement
of
myself
had
in
fact
felt
that
i
was
a
gentleman
among
gentlemen
using
the
word
in
its
strictly
technical
sense
and
so
vividly
did
this
conviction
remain
with
me
that
i
now
saw
any
defence
of
my
course
to
be
out
of
the
question
i
perceived
that
my
companions
had
meant
to
have
me
on
toast
from
the
first
i
mean
to
say
they
had
started
a
rag
with
me
a
bit
of
chaff
and
i
now
found
myself
rather
preposterously
enjoying
the
manner
in
which
they
had
chivied
me
i
mean
to
say
i
felt
myself
taking
it
as
one
gentleman
would
take
a
rag
from
other
gentlemen
not
as
a
bit
of
a
sneak
who
would
tell
the
truth
to
save
his
face
a
couple
of
chaffing
old
beggars
they
were
but
they
had
found
me
a
topping
dead
sportsman
of
their
own
sort
be
it
remembered
i
was
still
uncertain
whether
i
had
caught
something
of
that
alleged
american
spirit
or
whether
the
drink
had
made
me
feel
equal
at
least
to
americans
whatever
it
might
be
it
was
rather
great
and
i
was
prepared
to
face
effie
without
a
tremor
to
face
her
of
course
as
one
overtaken
by
a
weakness
for
spirits
when
the
bell
at
last
rang
i
donned
my
service
coat
and
assuming
a
look
of
profound
remorse
i
went
to
the
to
serve
the
morning
coffee
as
i
suspected
only
effie
was
present
i
believe
it
has
been
before
remarked
that
she
is
a
person
of
commanding
presence
with
a
manner
of
marked
determination
she
favoured
me
with
a
brief
but
chilling
glance
and
for
some
moments
thereafter
affected
quite
to
ignore
me
obviously
she
had
been
completely
greened
the
night
before
and
was
treating
me
with
a
proper
contempt
i
saw
that
it
was
no
use
grousing
at
fate
and
that
it
was
better
for
me
not
to
go
into
the
american
wilderness
since
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
i
was
prepared
to
accept
instant
dismissal
without
a
character
she
began
upon
me
however
after
her
first
cup
of
coffee
more
mildly
than
i
had
expected
ruggles
i
m
horribly
disappointed
in
not
more
so
than
i
myself
madam
i
replied
i
am
more
disappointed
she
continued
because
i
felt
that
cousin
egbert
had
something
in
him
something
in
him
yes
madam
i
murmured
sympathetically
and
that
you
were
the
man
to
bring
it
out
i
was
quite
hopeful
after
you
got
him
into
those
new
clothes
i
don
t
believe
any
one
else
could
have
done
it
and
now
it
turns
out
that
you
have
this
weakness
for
drink
not
only
that
but
you
have
a
mania
for
insisting
that
other
men
drink
with
you
think
of
those
two
poor
fellows
trailing
you
over
paris
yesterday
trying
to
save
you
from
i
shall
never
forget
it
madam
i
said
of
course
i
don
t
believe
that
jeff
tuttle
always
has
to
have
it
forced
on
him
jeff
tuttle
is
an
indian
but
cousin
egbert
is
different
you
tore
him
away
from
that
art
gallery
where
he
was
improving
his
mind
and
led
him
into
places
that
must
have
been
disgusting
to
him
all
he
wanted
was
to
study
the
world
s
masterpieces
in
canvas
and
marble
yet
you
put
a
cabman
s
hat
on
him
and
made
him
ride
an
antelope
or
whatever
the
thing
was
i
can
t
think
where
you
got
such
i
was
not
myself
i
can
only
say
that
i
seemed
to
be
subject
to
an
and
the
tuttle
person
was
one
of
their
indians
this
explained
so
much
about
him
you
don
t
look
like
a
periodical
souse
she
remarked
quite
so
but
you
must
be
a
wonder
when
you
do
start
the
point
is
am
i
doing
right
to
intrust
cousin
egbert
to
you
again
quite
so
it
seems
doubtful
if
you
are
the
person
to
develop
his
higher
against
my
better
judgment
i
here
felt
obliged
to
protest
that
i
had
always
been
given
the
highest
character
for
quietness
and
general
behaviour
and
that
i
could
safely
promise
that
i
should
be
guilty
of
no
further
lapses
of
this
kind
frankly
i
was
wishing
to
be
shopped
and
yet
i
could
not
resist
making
this
mild
defence
of
myself
such
i
have
found
to
be
the
way
of
human
nature
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
effie
was
more
than
half
persuaded
by
these
words
and
was
on
the
point
of
giving
me
another
trial
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
delighted
at
this
i
was
ready
to
give
up
all
americans
as
problems
one
too
many
for
me
and
yet
i
was
strangely
a
little
warmed
at
thinking
i
might
not
have
seen
the
last
of
cousin
egbert
whom
i
had
just
given
a
tuckup
you
shall
have
your
chance
she
said
at
last
and
just
to
show
you
that
i
m
not
narrow
you
can
go
over
to
the
sideboard
there
and
pour
yourself
out
a
little
one
it
ought
to
be
a
lifesaver
to
you
feeling
the
way
you
must
this
thank
you
madam
and
i
did
as
she
suggested
i
was
feeling
especially
fit
but
i
knew
that
i
ought
to
play
in
character
as
one
might
say
three
rousing
cheers
i
said
having
gathered
the
previous
day
that
this
was
a
popular
american
toast
she
stared
at
me
rather
oddly
but
made
no
comment
other
than
to
announce
her
departure
on
a
shopping
tour
her
bonnet
i
noted
was
quite
wrong
too
extremely
modish
it
was
accenting
its
own
lines
at
the
expense
of
a
face
to
which
less
attention
should
have
been
called
this
is
a
mistake
common
to
the
sex
however
they
little
dream
how
sadly
they
mock
and
betray
their
own
faces
nothing
i
think
is
more
pathetic
than
their
trustful
unconsciousness
of
the
tragedy
the
rather
plainish
face
under
the
contemptuous
structure
that
points
to
it
and
shrieks
derision
the
rather
plain
woman
who
knows
what
to
put
upon
her
head
is
a
woman
of
genius
i
have
seen
three
perhaps
i
now
went
to
the
room
of
cousin
egbert
i
found
him
awake
and
cheerful
but
disinclined
to
arise
it
was
hard
for
me
to
realize
that
his
simple
kindly
face
could
mask
the
guile
he
had
displayed
the
night
before
he
showed
no
sign
of
regret
for
the
false
light
in
which
he
had
placed
me
indeed
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
as
cheerful
and
independent
as
if
he
had
paid
for
a
park
chair
i
fancy
he
began
that
we
ought
to
spend
a
peaceful
day
indoors
the
trouble
with
these
foreign
parts
is
that
they
don
t
have
enough
home
life
if
it
isn
t
one
thing
it
s
sometimes
it
s
both
sir
i
said
and
he
saw
at
once
that
i
was
not
to
be
wheedled
thereupon
he
grinned
brazenly
at
me
and
demanded
what
did
she
say
well
sir
i
said
she
was
highly
indignant
at
me
for
taking
you
and
tuttle
into
public
houses
and
forcing
you
to
drink
liquor
but
she
was
good
enough
after
i
had
expressed
my
great
regret
and
promised
to
do
better
in
the
future
to
promise
that
i
should
have
another
chance
it
was
more
than
i
could
have
hoped
sir
after
the
outrageous
manner
in
which
i
he
grinned
again
at
this
and
in
spite
of
my
resentment
i
found
myself
grinning
with
him
i
am
aware
that
this
was
a
most
undignified
submission
to
the
injustice
he
had
put
upon
me
and
it
was
far
from
the
line
of
stern
rebuke
that
i
had
fully
meant
to
adopt
with
him
but
there
seemed
no
other
way
i
mean
to
say
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
m
glad
to
hear
you
talk
that
way
he
said
it
shows
you
may
have
something
in
you
after
all
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
learn
to
say
no
then
you
won
t
be
so
much
trouble
to
those
who
have
to
look
after
yes
sir
i
said
i
shall
try
then
i
ll
give
you
another
chance
he
said
sternly
i
mean
to
say
it
was
all
spoofing
the
way
we
talked
i
am
certain
he
knew
it
as
well
as
i
did
and
i
am
sure
we
both
enjoyed
it
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
think
it
shows
a
lack
of
dignity
to
unbend
in
this
manner
on
occasion
true
it
is
not
with
every
one
i
could
afford
to
do
so
but
cousin
egbert
seemed
to
be
an
exception
to
almost
every
rule
of
conduct
at
his
earnest
request
i
now
procured
for
him
another
carafe
of
iced
water
he
seemed
already
to
have
consumed
two
of
these
after
which
he
suggested
that
i
read
to
him
the
book
he
had
was
the
story
robinson
crusoe
and
i
began
a
chapter
which
describes
some
of
the
hero
s
adventures
on
his
lonely
island
cousin
egbert
i
was
glad
to
note
was
soon
sleeping
soundly
so
i
left
him
and
retired
to
my
own
room
for
a
bit
of
needed
rest
the
story
of
robinson
crusoe
is
one
in
which
many
interesting
facts
are
conveyed
regarding
life
upon
remote
islands
where
there
are
practically
no
modern
conveniences
and
one
is
put
to
all
sorts
of
crude
makeshifts
but
for
me
the
narrative
contains
too
little
dialogue
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
was
left
to
myself
a
period
of
peace
that
i
found
most
welcome
not
until
evening
did
i
meet
any
of
the
family
except
cousin
egbert
who
partook
of
some
light
nourishment
late
in
the
afternoon
then
it
was
that
effie
summoned
me
when
she
had
dressed
for
dinner
to
say
we
are
sailing
for
home
the
day
after
see
that
cousin
egbert
has
everything
he
the
following
day
was
a
busy
one
for
there
were
many
boxes
to
be
packed
against
the
morrow
s
sailing
and
much
shopping
to
do
for
cousin
egbert
although
he
was
much
against
this
it
s
all
nonsense
he
insisted
her
saying
all
that
truck
helps
to
finish
me
look
at
me
i
ve
been
in
europe
darned
near
four
months
and
i
can
t
see
that
i
m
a
lick
more
finished
than
when
i
left
red
gap
of
course
it
may
show
on
me
so
other
people
can
see
it
but
i
don
t
believe
it
does
at
nevertheless
i
bought
him
no
end
of
suits
and
smart
haberdashery
when
the
last
box
had
been
strapped
i
hastened
to
our
old
lodgings
on
the
chance
of
seeing
the
honourable
george
once
more
i
found
him
dejectedly
studying
an
ancient
copy
of
the
too
evidently
he
had
dined
that
night
in
a
costume
which
would
i
am
sure
have
offended
even
cousin
egbert
above
his
dress
trousers
he
wore
a
golfing
waistcoat
and
a
shooting
jacket
however
i
could
not
allow
myself
to
be
distressed
by
this
indeed
i
knew
that
worse
would
come
i
forebore
to
comment
upon
the
extraordinary
choice
of
garments
he
had
made
i
knew
it
was
quite
useless
from
any
word
that
he
let
fall
during
our
chat
he
might
have
supposed
himself
to
be
dressed
as
an
english
gentleman
should
be
he
bade
me
seat
myself
and
for
some
time
we
smoked
our
pipes
in
a
friendly
silence
i
had
feared
that
as
on
the
last
occasion
he
would
row
me
for
having
deserted
him
but
he
no
longer
seemed
to
harbour
this
unjust
thought
we
spoke
of
america
and
i
suggested
that
he
might
some
time
come
out
to
shoot
big
game
along
the
ohio
or
the
mississippi
he
replied
moodily
after
a
long
interval
that
if
he
ever
did
come
out
it
would
be
to
set
up
a
cattle
plantation
it
was
rather
agreed
that
he
would
come
should
i
send
for
him
can
t
sit
around
forever
waiting
for
old
nevil
s
toast
crumbs
said
he
we
chatted
for
a
time
of
home
politics
which
was
of
course
in
a
wretched
state
there
was
a
time
when
we
might
both
have
been
won
to
a
sane
and
reasoned
liberalism
but
the
present
government
was
coming
it
a
bit
too
thick
for
us
we
said
some
sharp
things
about
the
little
welsh
attorney
who
was
beginning
to
be
england
s
humiliation
then
it
was
time
for
me
to
go
the
moment
was
rather
awkward
for
the
honourable
george
to
my
great
embarrassment
pressed
upon
me
his
one
that
we
had
carried
during
all
our
travels
and
into
which
tidily
fitted
a
quart
flask
brandy
we
usually
carried
in
it
i
managed
to
accept
it
with
a
word
of
thanks
and
then
amazingly
he
shook
hands
twice
with
me
as
we
said
i
had
never
dreamed
he
could
be
so
greatly
affected
indeed
i
had
always
supposed
that
there
was
nothing
of
the
sentimentalist
about
him
so
the
honourable
george
and
i
were
definitely
apart
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
it
was
with
mingled
emotions
that
i
set
sail
next
day
for
the
foreign
land
to
which
i
had
been
exiled
by
a
turn
of
the
cards
not
only
was
i
off
to
a
wilderness
where
a
life
of
daily
adventure
was
the
normal
life
but
i
was
to
mingle
with
foreigners
who
promised
to
be
quite
almost
impossibly
queer
if
the
family
of
flouds
could
be
taken
as
a
sample
of
the
native
american
knowing
indians
like
the
tuttle
person
that
sort
of
thing
if
some
would
be
less
queer
others
would
be
even
more
queer
with
queerness
of
a
sort
to
tax
even
my
something
which
had
been
sorely
taxed
i
need
hardly
say
since
that
fatal
evening
when
the
honourable
george
s
intuitions
had
played
him
false
in
the
game
of
drawing
poker
i
was
not
the
first
of
my
countrymen
however
to
find
himself
in
desperate
straits
and
i
resolved
to
behave
as
england
expects
us
to
i
have
said
that
i
was
viewing
the
prospect
with
mingled
emotions
before
we
had
been
out
many
hours
they
became
so
mingled
that
having
crossed
the
channel
many
times
i
could
no
longer
pretend
to
ignore
their
true
nature
for
three
days
i
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
elements
and
it
was
then
i
discovered
a
certain
hardness
in
the
nature
of
cousin
egbert
which
i
had
not
before
suspected
it
was
only
by
speaking
in
the
sharpest
manner
to
him
that
i
was
able
to
secure
the
nursing
my
condition
demanded
i
made
no
doubt
he
would
actually
have
left
me
to
the
care
of
a
steward
had
i
not
been
firm
with
him
i
have
known
him
leave
my
bedside
for
an
hour
at
a
time
when
it
seemed
probable
that
i
would
pass
away
at
any
moment
and
more
than
once
when
i
summoned
him
in
the
night
to
administer
one
of
the
remedies
with
which
i
had
provided
myself
or
perhaps
to
question
him
if
the
ship
were
out
of
danger
he
exhibited
something
very
like
irritation
indeed
he
was
never
properly
impressed
by
my
suffering
and
at
times
when
he
would
answer
my
call
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
had
been
passing
idle
moments
in
the
or
elsewhere
quite
as
if
the
situation
were
an
ordinary
one
it
is
only
fair
to
say
however
that
toward
the
end
of
my
long
and
interesting
illness
i
had
quite
broken
his
spirit
and
brought
him
to
be
as
attentive
as
even
i
could
wish
by
the
time
i
was
able
with
his
assistance
to
go
upon
deck
again
he
was
bringing
me
nutritive
wines
and
jellies
without
being
told
and
so
attentive
did
he
remain
that
i
overheard
a
address
him
as
florence
nightingale
i
also
overheard
the
senator
tell
him
that
i
had
got
his
sheep
whatever
that
may
have
meant
a
sheep
or
a
goat
some
domestic
animal
yet
with
all
his
willingness
he
was
clumsy
in
his
handling
of
me
he
seemed
to
take
nothing
with
any
proper
seriousness
and
in
spite
of
my
sharpest
warning
he
would
never
wear
the
proper
clothes
so
that
i
always
felt
he
was
attracting
undue
attention
to
us
indeed
i
should
hardly
care
to
cross
with
him
again
and
this
i
told
him
straight
of
the
joys
of
concerning
which
the
boat
companies
speak
so
enthusiastically
in
their
folders
the
less
said
the
better
it
is
a
childish
mind
i
think
that
can
be
impressed
by
the
mere
wabbly
bulk
of
water
it
is
undoubtedly
tremendous
but
nothing
to
kick
up
such
a
row
about
the
truth
is
that
the
prospect
from
a
ship
s
deck
lacks
that
variety
which
one
may
enjoy
from
almost
any
english
hillside
one
sees
merely
water
and
that
s
all
about
it
it
will
be
understood
therefore
that
i
hailed
our
approach
to
the
shores
of
foreign
america
with
relief
if
not
with
enthusiasm
even
this
was
better
than
an
ocean
which
has
only
size
in
its
favour
and
has
been
quite
too
foolishly
overrated
we
were
soon
steaming
into
the
harbour
of
one
of
their
large
cities
chicago
i
had
fancied
it
to
be
until
the
chance
remark
of
an
american
who
looked
to
be
a
fellow
identified
it
as
new
york
i
was
much
annoyed
now
at
the
behaviour
of
cousin
egbert
who
burst
into
silly
cheers
at
the
slightest
excuse
a
passing
steamer
a
green
hill
or
a
rusty
statue
of
quite
ungainly
height
which
seemed
to
be
made
of
crude
iron
do
as
i
would
i
could
not
restrain
him
from
these
unseemly
shouts
i
could
not
help
contrasting
his
boisterousness
with
the
fine
reserve
which
for
example
the
honourable
george
would
have
maintained
under
these
circumstances
a
further
relief
it
was
therefore
when
we
were
on
the
dock
and
his
mind
was
diverted
to
other
matters
a
long
time
we
were
detained
by
customs
officials
who
seemed
rather
overwhelmed
by
the
gowns
and
millinery
of
effie
but
we
were
at
last
free
and
taken
through
the
streets
of
the
crude
new
american
city
of
new
york
to
a
hotel
overlooking
what
i
dare
say
in
their
simplicity
they
call
their
hyde
park
chapter
five
i
must
admit
that
at
this
inn
they
did
things
quite
nicely
doubtless
because
it
seemed
to
be
almost
entirely
staffed
by
foreigners
one
would
scarce
have
known
within
its
walls
that
one
had
come
out
to
north
america
nor
that
savage
wilderness
surrounded
one
on
every
hand
indeed
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
we
were
quite
at
the
edge
of
the
rough
western
frontier
for
in
but
one
night
s
journey
we
were
to
reach
the
american
mountains
to
visit
some
people
who
inhabited
a
camp
in
their
dense
wilds
a
bit
of
romantic
thrill
i
felt
in
this
adventure
for
we
should
encounter
i
inferred
people
of
the
hardy
pioneer
stock
that
has
pushed
the
american
civilization
such
as
it
is
ever
westward
i
pictured
the
stalwart
woodsman
axe
in
hand
braving
the
forest
to
fell
trees
for
his
rustic
home
while
at
night
the
red
savages
prowled
about
to
scalp
any
who
might
stray
from
the
blazing
campfire
on
the
day
of
our
landing
i
had
read
something
of
this
of
depredations
committed
by
their
indians
at
arizona
from
what
would
i
take
it
be
their
victoria
station
we
three
began
our
journey
in
one
of
the
pullman
night
coaches
the
senator
of
this
family
having
proceeded
to
their
home
settlement
of
red
gap
with
word
that
he
must
look
after
his
fences
referring
doubtless
to
those
about
his
cattle
plantation
as
our
train
moved
out
effie
summoned
me
for
a
serious
talk
concerning
the
significance
of
our
present
visit
not
of
the
wilderness
dangers
to
which
we
might
be
exposed
but
of
its
social
aspects
which
seemed
to
be
of
prime
importance
we
were
to
visit
i
learned
one
charles
of
boston
and
red
gap
he
being
a
person
who
mattered
enormously
coming
from
one
of
the
very
oldest
families
of
boston
a
port
on
their
east
coast
and
a
place
i
gathered
in
which
some
decent
attention
is
given
to
the
matter
of
who
has
been
one
s
family
a
bit
of
a
shock
it
was
to
learn
that
in
this
rough
land
they
had
their
castes
and
precedences
i
saw
i
had
been
right
to
suspect
that
even
a
crude
society
could
not
exist
without
its
rules
for
separating
one
s
superiors
from
the
lower
sorts
i
began
to
feel
at
once
more
at
home
and
i
attended
the
discourse
of
effie
with
close
attention
the
boston
person
in
one
of
those
irresponsibly
romantic
moments
that
sometimes
trap
the
best
of
us
had
married
far
beneath
him
espousing
the
simple
daughter
of
one
of
the
crude
families
of
red
gap
further
so
inattentive
to
details
had
he
been
he
had
neglected
to
secure
an
settlement
as
our
own
men
so
wisely
make
it
their
rule
to
do
and
was
now
suffering
a
painful
embarrassment
from
this
folly
for
the
controlling
the
rather
sizable
family
fortune
had
harshly
insisted
that
the
pair
reside
in
red
gap
permitting
no
more
than
an
occasional
summer
visit
to
his
native
boston
whose
inhabitants
she
affected
not
to
admire
of
course
the
poor
fellow
suffers
frightfully
explained
effie
shut
off
there
away
from
all
he
d
been
brought
up
to
but
good
has
come
of
it
for
his
presence
has
simply
done
wonders
for
us
before
he
came
our
social
life
was
too
awful
for
words
oh
a
practically
every
one
in
town
attended
our
dances
no
one
had
ever
told
us
any
better
the
bohemian
set
mingled
freely
with
the
very
oldest
families
oh
in
a
way
that
would
never
be
tolerated
in
london
society
i
m
sure
and
everything
so
crude
why
i
can
remember
when
no
one
thought
of
putting
doilies
under
the
no
tone
to
it
at
all
for
years
we
had
no
country
club
if
you
can
believe
that
and
even
now
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
charles
and
a
few
of
us
there
are
still
some
of
the
older
families
that
are
simply
sloppy
in
their
entertaining
and
promiscuous
the
trouble
i
ve
had
with
the
senator
and
cousin
egbert
the
flouds
are
an
old
family
i
suggested
wishing
to
understand
these
matters
deeply
the
flouds
she
answered
impressively
were
living
in
red
gap
before
the
spur
track
was
ever
run
out
to
the
canning
factory
and
i
guess
you
know
what
that
means
quite
so
madam
i
suggested
and
indeed
though
it
puzzled
me
a
bit
it
sounded
rather
tremendous
as
meaning
with
us
something
like
since
the
battle
of
hastings
but
as
i
say
charles
at
once
gave
us
a
glimpse
of
the
better
things
thanks
to
him
the
bohemian
set
and
the
north
side
set
are
now
fairly
distinct
the
scraps
we
ve
had
with
that
bohemian
set
he
has
a
real
genius
for
leadership
charles
has
but
i
know
he
often
finds
it
so
discouraging
getting
people
to
know
their
places
even
his
own
lysander
john
pettengill
but
you
ll
see
how
impossible
she
is
poor
old
soul
i
shouldn
t
talk
about
her
i
really
shouldn
t
awfully
good
heart
the
poor
old
dear
has
but
well
i
don
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
tell
you
the
exact
truth
in
plain
words
you
d
find
it
out
soon
enough
she
is
simply
a
confirmed
the
trial
she
s
been
and
is
to
poor
charles
almost
no
respect
for
any
of
the
higher
things
he
stands
for
and
temper
well
i
ve
heard
her
swear
at
him
till
you
d
have
thought
it
was
jeff
tuttle
packing
a
green
cayuse
for
the
first
time
words
talk
about
words
and
cousin
egbert
always
standing
in
with
her
he
s
been
another
awful
trial
refusing
to
play
tennis
at
the
country
club
or
to
take
up
golf
or
do
any
of
those
smart
things
though
i
got
him
a
beautiful
lot
of
sticks
but
no
when
he
isn
t
out
in
the
hills
he
d
rather
sit
down
in
that
back
room
at
the
silver
dollar
saloon
playing
cribbage
all
day
with
a
lot
of
drunken
loafers
but
i
m
so
hoping
that
will
be
changed
now
that
i
ve
made
him
see
there
are
better
things
in
life
don
t
you
really
think
he
s
another
man
to
an
extent
madam
i
dare
say
i
replied
cautiously
it
s
chiefly
what
i
got
you
for
she
went
on
and
then
in
a
general
way
you
will
give
tone
to
our
establishment
the
moment
i
saw
you
i
knew
you
could
be
an
influence
for
good
among
us
no
one
there
has
ever
had
anything
like
you
not
even
charles
he
s
tried
to
have
american
valets
but
you
never
can
get
them
to
understand
their
place
charles
finds
them
so
offensively
familiar
they
don
t
seem
to
realize
but
of
course
you
i
inclined
my
head
in
sympathetic
understanding
i
m
looking
forward
to
charles
meeting
you
i
guess
he
ll
be
a
little
put
out
at
our
having
you
but
there
s
no
harm
letting
him
see
i
m
to
be
reckoned
with
naturally
his
wife
millie
is
more
or
less
mentioned
as
a
social
leader
but
i
never
could
see
that
she
is
really
any
more
prominent
than
i
am
in
fact
last
year
after
our
bazaar
of
all
nations
our
pictures
in
costume
were
in
the
spokane
paper
as
red
gap
s
rival
society
queens
and
i
suppose
that
s
what
we
are
though
we
work
together
pretty
well
as
a
rule
still
i
must
say
having
you
puts
me
a
couple
of
notches
ahead
of
her
only
for
heaven
s
sake
keep
your
eye
on
cousin
egbert
i
shall
do
my
duty
madam
i
returned
thinking
it
all
rather
morbidly
interesting
these
weird
details
about
their
county
families
i
m
sure
you
will
she
said
at
parting
i
feel
that
we
shall
do
things
right
this
year
last
year
the
sunday
spokane
paper
used
to
have
nearly
a
column
under
the
heading
social
doings
of
red
gap
s
smart
this
year
we
ll
have
a
good
two
columns
if
i
don
t
miss
my
in
the
i
found
cousin
egbert
staring
gloomily
into
vacancy
as
one
might
say
the
reason
i
knew
being
that
he
had
vainly
pleaded
with
effie
to
be
allowed
to
spend
this
time
at
their
coney
island
which
is
a
sort
of
brighton
he
transferred
his
stare
to
me
but
it
lost
none
of
its
gloom
hell
begins
to
pop
said
he
referring
to
what
sir
i
rejoined
with
some
severity
for
i
have
never
held
with
profanity
referring
to
charles
belknap
hyphen
jackson
of
boston
said
he
the
greatest
little
that
ever
crossed
the
hills
with
a
bracelet
on
one
wrist
and
a
watch
on
the
other
and
a
eyeglass
and
a
gold
cigareet
case
and
key
chains
rings
bangles
and
jewellery
till
he
d
sink
like
lead
if
he
ever
fell
into
the
crick
with
all
that
metal
you
are
speaking
sir
about
a
person
who
matters
enormously
i
rebuked
him
if
i
hadn
t
been
afraid
of
getting
arrested
i
d
have
shot
him
long
it
s
not
done
sir
i
said
quite
horrified
by
his
rash
words
it
s
liable
to
be
he
insisted
i
bet
ma
pettengill
will
go
in
with
me
on
it
any
time
i
give
her
the
word
say
listen
there
s
one
good
the
confirmed
mixer
sir
for
i
remembered
the
term
the
best
ever
any
one
can
set
into
her
game
that
s
got
a
stack
of
he
uttered
this
with
deep
feeling
whatever
it
might
exactly
mean
i
can
be
pushed
just
so
far
he
insisted
sullenly
it
struck
me
then
that
he
should
perhaps
have
been
kept
longer
in
one
of
the
european
capitals
i
feared
his
brief
contact
with
those
refining
influences
had
left
him
less
polished
than
effie
seemed
to
hope
i
wondered
uneasily
if
he
might
not
cause
her
to
miss
her
guess
yet
i
saw
he
was
in
no
mood
to
be
reasoned
with
and
i
retired
to
my
bed
which
the
blackamoor
guard
had
done
out
here
i
meditated
profoundly
for
some
time
before
i
slept
morning
found
our
coach
shunted
to
a
siding
at
a
backwoods
settlement
on
the
borders
of
an
inland
sea
the
scene
was
wild
beyond
description
where
quite
almost
anything
might
be
expected
to
happen
though
i
was
a
bit
reassured
by
the
presence
of
a
number
of
persons
of
both
sexes
who
appeared
to
make
little
of
the
dangers
by
which
we
were
surrounded
i
mean
to
say
since
they
thus
took
their
women
into
the
wilds
so
freely
i
would
still
be
a
dead
sportsman
after
a
brief
wait
at
a
rude
quay
we
embarked
on
a
launch
and
steamed
out
over
the
water
mile
after
mile
we
passed
wooded
shores
that
sloped
up
to
mountains
of
prodigious
height
indeed
the
description
of
the
rocky
mountains
of
which
i
take
these
to
be
a
part
have
not
been
overdrawn
from
time
to
time
at
the
edge
of
the
primeval
forest
i
could
make
out
the
rude
shelters
of
hunter
and
trapper
who
braved
these
perils
for
the
sake
of
a
scanty
livelihood
for
their
hardy
wives
and
little
ones
cousin
egbert
beside
me
seemed
unimpressed
making
no
outcry
at
the
fearsome
wildness
of
the
scene
and
when
i
spoke
of
the
terrific
height
of
the
mountains
he
merely
admonished
me
to
quit
my
the
sole
interest
he
had
thus
far
displayed
was
in
the
title
of
our
craft
think
of
the
guy
s
imagination
naming
this
here
chafing
dish
the
said
he
but
i
was
impatient
of
levity
at
so
solemn
a
moment
and
promptly
rebuked
him
for
having
donned
a
cravat
that
i
had
warned
him
was
for
town
wear
alone
whereat
he
subsided
and
did
not
again
intrude
upon
me
far
ahead
at
length
i
could
descry
an
open
glade
at
the
forest
edge
and
above
this
i
soon
spied
floating
the
north
american
flag
or
national
emblem
it
is
of
course
known
to
us
that
the
natives
are
given
to
making
rather
a
silly
noise
over
this
flag
of
theirs
but
in
this
instance
the
pioneer
fighting
his
way
into
the
wilderness
and
hoisting
it
above
his
frontier
home
i
felt
strangely
indisposed
to
criticise
i
understood
that
he
could
be
greatly
cheered
by
the
flag
of
the
country
he
had
left
behind
we
now
neared
a
small
dock
from
which
two
ladies
brandished
handkerchiefs
at
us
and
were
presently
welcomed
by
them
i
had
no
difficulty
in
identifying
the
charles
a
lively
featured
brunette
of
neutral
tints
rather
stubby
as
to
figure
but
modishly
done
out
in
white
flannels
she
surveyed
us
interestedly
through
a
lorgnon
observing
which
effie
was
quick
with
her
own
i
surmised
that
neither
of
them
was
skilled
with
this
form
of
glass
which
must
really
be
raised
with
an
air
or
it
s
no
good
also
that
each
was
not
a
little
chagrined
to
note
that
the
other
possessed
one
nor
was
it
less
evident
that
the
other
lady
was
the
mother
of
i
mean
to
say
the
confirmed
mixer
an
elderly
person
of
immense
bulk
in
gray
heavy
boots
and
a
flowered
blouse
that
was
overwhelming
her
face
under
her
grayish
thatch
of
hair
was
broad
and
smiling
the
eyes
keen
the
mouth
wide
and
the
nose
rather
a
bit
blobby
although
at
every
point
she
was
far
from
vogue
she
impressed
me
not
unpleasantly
even
her
voice
a
magnificently
hoarse
rumble
was
primed
with
a
sort
of
uncouth
which
one
might
accept
in
the
states
of
course
it
would
never
do
with
us
i
fancied
i
could
at
once
detect
why
they
had
called
her
the
she
embraced
effie
with
an
air
of
being
about
to
strangle
the
woman
she
affectionately
wrung
the
hands
of
cousin
egbert
and
had
grasped
my
own
tightly
before
i
could
evade
her
not
having
looked
for
that
sort
of
thing
that
s
cousin
egbert
s
man
called
effie
but
even
then
the
powerful
creature
would
not
release
me
until
her
daughter
had
called
sharply
maw
don
t
you
hear
he
s
a
nevertheless
she
gave
my
hand
a
parting
shake
before
turning
to
the
others
glad
to
see
a
human
face
at
last
she
boomed
here
i
ve
been
a
month
in
this
dinky
hole
which
i
thought
strange
since
we
were
surrounded
by
league
upon
league
of
the
primal
wilderness
cooped
up
like
a
hen
in
a
barrel
she
added
in
tones
that
must
have
carried
well
out
over
the
lake
cousin
egbert
s
man
repeated
effie
a
little
ostentatiously
i
thought
poor
egbert
s
so
dependent
on
him
quite
helpless
without
cousin
egbert
muttered
sullenly
to
himself
as
he
assisted
me
with
the
bags
then
he
straightened
himself
to
address
them
won
him
in
a
game
of
he
remarked
quite
viciously
does
he
doll
up
like
that
all
the
time
demanded
the
mixer
or
has
he
just
come
from
a
masquerade
what
s
he
represent
anyway
and
these
words
when
i
had
taken
especial
pains
and
resorted
to
all
manner
of
threats
to
turn
him
smartly
out
in
the
of
a
pioneer
maw
cried
our
hostess
do
try
to
forget
that
dreadful
nickname
of
egbert
i
sure
will
if
he
keeps
his
disguise
on
she
rumbled
back
the
old
horned
toad
is
most
as
funny
as
really
i
mean
to
say
they
talked
most
amazingly
i
was
but
too
glad
when
they
moved
on
and
we
could
follow
with
the
bags
calls
her
maw
all
right
now
hissed
cousin
egbert
in
my
ear
but
when
that
begoshed
husband
of
hers
is
around
the
house
she
calls
her
his
tone
was
vastly
bitter
he
continued
to
mutter
sullenly
to
himself
a
way
he
had
until
we
had
disposed
of
the
luggage
and
i
was
laying
out
his
afternoon
and
evening
wear
in
one
of
the
small
detached
houses
to
which
we
had
been
assigned
nor
did
he
sink
his
grievance
on
the
arrival
of
the
mixer
a
few
moments
later
he
now
addressed
her
as
ma
and
asked
if
she
had
the
makings
which
puzzled
me
until
she
drew
from
the
pocket
of
her
skirt
a
small
cloth
sack
of
tobacco
and
some
bits
of
brown
paper
from
which
they
both
fashioned
cigarettes
the
smart
set
of
red
gap
is
holding
its
first
annual
meeting
for
the
election
of
officers
back
there
she
began
after
she
had
emitted
twin
jets
of
smoke
from
the
widely
separated
corners
of
her
set
mouth
i
say
you
know
where
s
hyphen
old
top
demanded
cousin
egbert
in
a
quite
vile
imitation
of
one
speaking
in
the
correct
manner
fishing
answered
the
mixer
with
a
grin
in
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
clothes
these
here
eastern
trout
won
t
notice
you
unless
you
dress
i
thought
this
strange
indeed
but
cousin
egbert
merely
grinned
in
his
turn
how
d
he
get
you
into
this
awfully
horrid
rough
place
he
next
demanded
made
him
this
or
red
gap
for
yours
i
says
the
two
weeks
in
new
york
wasn
t
so
bad
what
with
millie
and
me
getting
new
clothes
though
him
and
her
both
jumped
on
me
that
i
m
getting
too
gay
about
clothes
for
a
party
of
my
age
what
s
age
to
me
i
says
when
i
like
bright
colours
then
we
tried
his
in
boston
but
i
played
that
string
out
in
a
week
two
sisters
thin
noses
and
knitted
shawls
stick
around
in
the
back
parlour
talking
about
families
whether
it
was
aunt
lucy
s
abigail
or
the
concord
cousin
s
hester
that
married
an
adams
in
and
moved
out
west
to
buffalo
i
thought
first
i
could
liven
them
up
some
know
looked
like
it
would
help
a
lot
for
them
to
get
out
in
a
hack
and
get
a
few
shots
of
hooch
under
their
belts
stop
at
a
few
roadhouses
take
in
a
good
variety
show
get
em
to
feeling
good
understand
no
use
wouldn
t
start
darn
it
they
held
off
from
me
don
t
know
why
i
sure
wore
clothes
for
them
yes
sir
i
d
get
dressed
up
like
a
broken
arm
every
afternoon
and
say
i
got
one
sheath
skirt
black
and
white
striped
that
just
has
to
be
looked
at
never
phased
them
though
i
got
to
thinking
mebbe
it
was
because
i
made
my
own
smokes
instead
of
using
those
vegetable
cigarettes
of
jackson
s
or
maybe
because
i
d
get
parched
and
demand
a
slug
of
booze
before
supper
like
a
sunday
afternoon
all
the
time
when
you
eat
a
big
dinner
and
everybody
s
sleepy
and
mad
because
they
can
t
take
a
nap
and
have
to
set
around
and
play
a
few
church
tunes
on
the
organ
or
look
through
the
album
ain
t
that
right
don
t
it
fade
you
murmured
cousin
egbert
with
deep
feeling
and
little
lysander
my
only
grandson
poor
kid
getting
the
fidgets
because
they
try
to
make
him
talk
different
and
raise
hell
every
time
he
knocks
over
a
vase
or
busts
a
window
say
would
you
believe
it
they
wanted
to
keep
him
there
yes
sir
make
him
refined
not
for
me
his
father
s
about
all
he
can
survive
in
those
respects
i
says
what
do
you
think
wanted
to
let
his
hair
grow
so
he
d
have
curls
some
dames
yes
i
bet
they
d
have
give
the
kid
lovely
days
boston
may
be
all
for
grandfathers
i
says
not
for
grandsons
then
jackson
was
set
on
bar
harbor
and
i
had
to
be
firm
again
darn
it
that
man
is
always
making
me
be
firm
so
here
we
are
he
said
it
was
a
camp
and
that
sounded
good
but
my
lands
he
wears
his
full
evening
dress
suit
for
supper
every
night
and
you
had
ought
to
heard
him
go
on
one
day
when
the
patent
went
my
good
gosh
said
cousin
egbert
quite
simply
i
had
now
finished
laying
out
his
things
and
was
about
to
withdraw
is
he
always
like
that
suddenly
demanded
the
mixer
pointing
at
me
oh
bill
s
all
right
when
you
get
him
out
with
a
crowd
explained
the
other
bill
s
really
got
the
makings
of
one
fine
little
they
both
regarded
me
genially
it
was
vastly
puzzling
i
mean
to
say
i
was
at
a
loss
how
to
take
it
for
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
with
us
and
yet
i
felt
a
queer
confused
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
talk
absurd
though
it
may
seem
i
felt
there
might
come
moments
in
which
america
would
appear
almost
not
impossible
as
i
went
out
cousin
egbert
was
telling
her
of
paris
i
lingered
to
hear
him
disclose
that
all
frenchmen
have
m
for
their
first
initial
and
that
the
louer
family
must
be
one
of
their
wealthiest
the
name
a
louer
being
conspicuous
on
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
their
real
estate
this
family
he
said
must
be
like
the
rothschilds
of
course
the
poor
soul
was
absurdly
wrong
i
mean
to
say
the
letter
m
merely
indicates
monsieur
which
is
their
foreign
way
of
spelling
mister
while
a
louer
signifies
to
i
resolved
to
explain
this
to
him
at
the
first
opportunity
not
thinking
it
right
that
he
should
spread
such
gross
error
among
a
race
still
but
having
now
a
bit
of
time
to
myself
i
observed
the
construction
of
this
rude
homestead
a
dozen
or
more
detached
or
structures
of
the
native
log
yet
with
the
interiors
more
smartly
done
out
than
i
had
supposed
was
common
even
with
the
most
prosperous
of
their
scouts
and
trappers
i
suspected
a
false
idea
of
this
rude
life
had
been
given
by
the
cinema
dramas
i
mean
to
say
with
pianos
telephones
objects
of
art
and
servants
one
saw
that
these
woodsmen
were
not
primitive
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
the
butler
proved
to
be
a
genuine
blackamoor
a
waterman
he
informed
me
his
wife
also
a
black
being
the
cook
an
elderly
creature
of
the
utmost
gravity
of
bearing
he
brought
to
his
professional
duties
a
finish
a
dignity
a
manner
in
short
that
i
have
scarce
known
excelled
among
our
own
serving
people
and
a
creature
he
was
of
the
most
eventful
past
as
he
informed
me
at
our
first
encounter
as
a
slave
he
had
commanded
an
immensely
high
price
some
twenty
thousand
dollars
as
the
american
money
is
called
and
two
prominent
slaveholders
had
once
fought
a
duel
to
the
death
over
his
possession
not
many
he
assured
me
had
been
so
eagerly
sought
after
they
being
for
the
most
part
held
cheaper
common
black
trash
he
put
it
early
tiring
of
the
life
of
slavery
he
had
fled
to
the
wilds
and
for
some
years
led
a
desperate
band
of
outlaws
whose
crimes
soon
put
a
price
upon
his
head
he
spoke
frankly
and
with
considerable
regret
of
these
lawless
years
at
the
outbreak
of
the
american
war
however
with
a
reward
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
offered
for
his
body
he
had
boldly
surrendered
to
their
secretary
of
state
for
war
receiving
a
full
pardon
for
his
crimes
on
condition
that
he
assist
in
directing
the
military
operations
against
the
slaveholding
aristocracy
invaluable
he
had
been
in
this
service
i
gathered
two
generals
named
respectively
grant
and
sherman
having
repeatedly
assured
him
that
but
for
his
aid
they
would
more
than
once
in
sheer
despair
have
laid
down
their
swords
i
could
readily
imagine
that
after
these
years
of
strife
he
had
been
glad
to
embrace
the
peaceful
calling
in
which
i
found
him
engaged
he
was
as
i
have
intimated
a
person
of
lofty
demeanour
with
a
vein
of
high
seriousness
yet
he
would
unbend
at
moments
as
frankly
as
a
child
and
play
at
a
simple
game
of
chance
with
a
pair
of
dice
this
he
was
good
enough
to
teach
to
myself
and
gained
from
me
quite
a
number
of
shillings
that
i
chanced
to
have
for
his
consort
a
person
of
tremendous
bulk
named
clarice
he
showed
a
most
chivalric
consideration
and
even
what
i
might
have
mistaken
for
timidity
in
one
not
a
confessed
desperado
in
truth
he
rather
flinched
when
she
interrupted
our
chat
from
the
kitchen
doorway
by
roundly
calling
him
an
old
black
i
saw
that
his
must
indeed
be
a
complex
nature
from
this
encounter
i
chanced
upon
two
lads
who
seemed
to
present
the
marks
of
the
backwoods
life
as
i
had
conceived
it
strolling
up
a
woodland
path
i
discovered
a
tent
pitched
among
the
trees
before
it
a
smouldering
campfire
over
which
a
hung
the
two
lads
of
ten
years
or
so
rushed
from
the
tent
to
regard
me
both
attired
in
shirts
and
leggings
of
deerskin
profusely
fringed
after
the
manner
in
which
the
red
indians
decorate
their
outing
or
they
were
armed
with
sheath
knives
and
revolvers
and
the
taller
bore
a
rifle
howdy
stranger
exclaimed
this
one
and
the
other
repeated
the
simple
american
phrase
of
greeting
responding
in
kind
i
was
bade
to
seat
myself
on
a
fallen
log
which
i
did
for
some
moments
they
appeared
to
ignore
me
excitedly
discussing
an
adventure
of
the
night
before
and
addressing
each
other
as
dead
shot
and
hawk
eye
from
their
quaint
backwoods
speech
i
gathered
that
dead
shot
the
taller
lad
had
the
day
before
been
captured
by
a
band
of
hostile
redskins
who
would
have
burned
him
at
the
stake
but
for
the
happy
chance
that
the
chieftain
s
daughter
had
become
enamoured
of
him
and
cut
his
bonds
they
now
planned
to
return
to
the
encampment
at
nightfall
to
fetch
away
the
daughter
whose
name
was
white
fawn
and
cleaned
and
oiled
their
weapons
for
the
enterprise
dead
shot
was
vindictive
in
the
extreme
swearing
to
engage
the
chieftain
in
mortal
combat
and
to
cut
his
heart
out
the
same
chieftain
in
former
years
having
led
his
savage
band
against
the
forest
home
of
dead
shot
while
he
was
yet
too
young
to
defend
it
and
scalped
both
of
his
parents
i
was
a
mere
stripling
then
but
now
the
coward
will
feel
my
steel
he
coldly
declared
it
had
become
absurdly
evident
as
i
listened
that
the
whole
thing
was
but
spoofing
of
a
silly
sort
that
lads
of
this
age
will
indulge
in
for
i
had
seen
the
younger
one
take
his
seat
at
the
luncheon
table
but
now
they
spoke
of
a
raid
on
the
settlement
to
procure
grub
as
the
american
slang
for
food
has
it
bidding
me
stop
on
there
and
to
utter
the
cry
of
the
great
horned
owl
if
danger
threatened
they
stealthily
crept
toward
the
buildings
of
the
camp
presently
came
a
scream
followed
by
a
hoarse
shout
of
rage
a
second
later
the
two
dashed
by
me
into
the
dense
woods
hawk
eye
bearing
a
plucked
fowl
soon
waterman
panted
up
the
path
brandishing
a
barge
pole
and
demanding
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
the
marauders
as
he
had
apparently
for
the
moment
reverted
to
his
primal
african
savagery
i
deliberately
misled
him
by
indicating
a
false
direction
upon
which
he
went
off
muttering
the
most
frightful
threats
the
two
culprits
returned
put
their
fowl
in
the
pot
to
boil
and
swore
me
eternal
fidelity
for
having
saved
them
they
declared
i
should
thereafter
be
known
as
keen
knife
and
that
needing
a
service
i
might
call
upon
them
freely
dead
shot
never
forgets
a
friend
affirmed
the
taller
lad
whereupon
i
formally
shook
hands
with
the
pair
and
left
them
to
their
childish
devices
they
were
plotting
as
i
left
to
capture
that
nigger
as
they
called
him
and
put
him
to
death
by
slow
torture
but
i
was
now
shrewd
enough
to
suspect
that
i
might
still
be
far
from
the
western
frontier
of
america
the
evidence
had
been
cumulative
but
was
no
longer
questionable
i
mean
to
say
one
might
do
here
somewhat
after
the
way
of
our
own
people
at
a
country
house
in
the
shires
i
resolved
at
the
first
opportunity
to
have
a
look
at
a
good
map
of
our
late
colonies
late
in
the
afternoon
our
party
gathered
upon
the
small
dock
and
i
understood
that
our
host
now
returned
from
his
trouting
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
he
came
propelled
in
a
native
canoe
by
a
hairy
backwoods
person
quite
wretchedly
gotten
up
even
for
a
wilderness
our
host
himself
i
was
quick
to
observe
was
vogue
to
the
last
detail
with
a
sense
of
dress
and
equipment
that
can
never
be
acquired
having
to
be
born
in
one
as
he
stepped
from
his
frail
craft
i
saw
that
he
was
rather
slight
of
stature
dark
with
slender
moustaches
a
finely
sensitive
nose
and
eyes
of
an
almost
austere
repose
that
he
had
much
of
the
real
manner
was
at
once
apparent
he
greeted
the
flouds
and
his
own
family
with
just
that
faint
touch
of
easy
superiority
which
would
stamp
him
to
the
trained
eye
as
one
that
really
mattered
effie
beckoned
me
to
the
group
let
ruggles
take
your
things
cousin
egbert
s
man
she
was
saying
after
a
startled
glance
at
cousin
egbert
our
host
turned
to
regard
me
with
flattering
interest
for
a
moment
then
transferred
to
me
his
oddments
of
fishing
machinery
his
rod
his
creel
his
luncheon
hamper
landing
net
small
scales
ointment
for
warding
off
midges
a
jar
of
cold
cream
a
case
containing
smoked
glasses
a
rolled
map
a
camera
a
book
of
flies
as
i
was
stowing
these
he
explained
that
his
sport
had
been
wretched
no
fish
had
been
hooked
because
his
guide
had
not
known
where
to
find
them
i
here
glanced
at
the
backwoods
person
referred
to
and
at
once
did
not
like
the
look
in
his
eyes
he
winked
swiftly
at
cousin
egbert
who
coughed
rather
formally
let
ruggles
help
you
to
change
continued
effie
he
s
awfully
handy
poor
cousin
egbert
is
perfectly
helpless
now
without
so
i
followed
our
host
to
his
own
detached
hut
though
feeling
a
bit
queer
at
being
passed
about
in
this
manner
i
mean
to
say
as
if
i
were
a
basket
of
fruit
yet
i
found
it
a
grateful
change
to
be
serving
one
who
knew
our
respective
places
and
what
i
should
do
for
him
his
manner
of
speech
also
was
less
barbarous
than
that
of
the
others
suggesting
that
he
might
have
lived
among
our
own
people
a
fortnight
or
so
and
have
tried
earnestly
to
correct
his
deficiencies
in
fact
he
remarked
to
me
after
a
bit
i
fancy
i
talk
rather
like
one
of
yourselves
what
and
was
pleased
as
punch
when
i
assured
him
that
i
had
observed
this
he
questioned
me
at
length
regarding
my
association
with
the
honourable
george
and
the
houses
at
which
we
would
have
stayed
being
immensely
particular
about
names
and
titles
you
ll
find
us
vastly
different
here
he
said
with
a
sigh
as
i
held
his
coat
for
him
crude
i
may
say
in
truth
red
gap
where
my
interests
largely
confine
me
is
a
town
of
impossible
persons
you
ll
see
in
no
time
what
i
i
can
already
imagine
it
sir
i
said
sympathetically
it
s
not
for
want
of
example
he
added
scores
of
times
i
show
them
better
ways
but
they
re
eaten
up
with
commercialism
i
perceived
him
to
be
a
person
of
profound
and
interesting
views
and
it
was
with
regret
i
left
him
to
bully
cousin
egbert
into
evening
dress
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
he
will
never
wear
this
except
it
have
the
look
of
having
been
forced
upon
him
by
several
persons
of
superior
physical
strength
the
evening
passed
in
a
refined
manner
with
cards
and
music
the
latter
being
emitted
from
a
phonograph
which
i
was
asked
to
attend
to
and
upon
which
i
reproduced
many
of
their
quaint
north
american
folksongs
such
as
everybody
is
doing
it
which
has
a
rare
native
rhythm
at
ten
o
clock
it
being
noticed
by
the
three
playing
dummy
bridge
that
cousin
egbert
and
the
mixer
were
absent
i
accompanied
our
host
in
search
of
them
in
cousin
egbert
s
hut
we
found
them
seated
at
a
bare
table
playing
at
cards
a
game
called
i
learned
cousin
egbert
had
removed
his
coat
collar
and
cravat
and
his
sleeves
were
rolled
to
his
elbows
like
a
navvy
s
both
smoked
the
brown
paper
cigarettes
you
see
murmured
as
we
looked
in
upon
them
quite
so
sir
i
said
discreetly
the
mixer
regarded
her
with
some
annoyance
i
thought
run
off
to
bed
jackson
she
directed
we
re
busy
i
m
putting
a
nick
in
s
bank
our
host
turned
away
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
that
i
dare
say
might
have
offended
her
had
she
observed
it
but
she
was
now
speaking
to
cousin
egbert
who
had
stared
at
us
brazenly
ring
that
bell
for
the
coon
i
ll
split
a
bottle
of
scotch
with
it
queerly
occurred
to
me
that
she
made
this
monstrous
suggestion
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
to
annoy
chapter
six
there
are
times
when
all
nature
seems
to
smile
yet
when
to
the
sensitive
mind
it
will
be
faintly
brought
that
the
possibilities
are
quite
tremendously
otherwise
if
one
will
consider
them
pro
and
con
i
mean
to
say
one
often
suspects
things
may
happen
when
it
doesn
t
look
so
the
succeeding
three
days
passed
with
so
ordered
a
calm
that
little
would
any
but
a
profound
thinker
have
fancied
tragedy
to
lurk
so
near
their
placid
surface
effie
and
continued
to
plan
the
approaching
social
campaign
at
red
gap
cousin
egbert
and
the
mixer
continued
their
card
game
for
the
trifling
stake
of
a
shilling
a
game
or
two
bits
as
it
is
known
in
the
american
monetary
system
and
our
host
continued
his
recreation
each
morning
i
turned
him
out
in
the
smartest
of
fishing
costumes
and
each
evening
i
assisted
him
to
change
it
is
true
i
was
now
compelled
to
observe
at
these
times
a
certain
lofty
irritability
in
his
character
yet
i
more
than
half
fancied
this
to
be
queerly
assumed
in
order
to
inform
me
that
he
was
not
unaccustomed
to
services
such
as
i
rendered
him
there
was
that
about
him
i
mean
to
say
when
he
sharply
rebuked
me
for
clumsiness
or
cried
out
stupid
it
had
a
perfunctory
languor
as
if
meant
to
show
me
he
could
address
a
servant
in
what
he
believed
to
be
the
grand
manner
in
this
to
be
sure
he
was
so
oddly
wrong
that
the
pathos
of
it
quite
drowned
what
i
might
otherwise
have
felt
of
resentment
but
i
next
observed
that
he
was
sharp
in
the
same
manner
with
the
hairy
backwoods
person
who
took
him
to
fish
each
day
using
words
to
him
which
i
for
one
would
have
employed
had
i
thought
them
merited
only
after
the
gravest
hesitation
i
have
before
remarked
that
i
did
not
like
the
gleam
in
this
person
s
eyes
he
was
very
apparently
a
not
quite
nice
person
also
i
more
than
once
observed
him
to
wink
at
cousin
egbert
in
an
evil
manner
as
i
have
so
truly
said
how
close
may
tragedy
be
to
us
when
life
seems
most
correct
it
was
s
custom
to
raise
a
view
halloo
each
evening
when
he
returned
down
the
lake
so
that
we
might
gather
at
the
dock
to
oversee
his
landing
i
must
admit
that
he
disembarked
with
somewhat
the
manner
of
a
visiting
royalty
demanding
much
attention
and
assistance
with
his
impedimenta
undoubtedly
he
liked
to
be
looked
at
this
was
what
one
rather
felt
and
i
can
fancy
that
this
very
human
trait
of
his
had
in
a
manner
worn
upon
the
probably
undisciplined
nerves
of
the
backwoods
josser
had
in
fact
deprived
him
of
his
goat
as
the
native
people
have
it
be
this
as
it
may
we
gathered
at
the
dock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
of
our
stay
to
assist
at
the
return
as
the
native
log
craft
neared
the
dock
our
host
daringly
arose
to
a
graceful
kneeling
posture
in
the
bow
and
saluted
us
charmingly
the
woods
person
in
the
stern
wielding
his
single
oar
in
gloomy
silence
at
the
moment
a
most
poetic
image
occurred
to
me
that
he
was
like
a
dull
grim
figure
of
fate
that
fetches
us
low
at
the
moment
of
our
highest
seeming
i
mean
to
say
it
was
a
silly
thought
perhaps
yet
i
afterward
recalled
it
most
vividly
holding
his
creel
aloft
our
host
hailed
us
full
thanks
to
going
where
i
wished
and
paying
no
attention
to
silly
guides
he
beamed
upon
us
in
an
unquestionably
superior
manner
and
again
from
the
moody
figure
at
the
stern
i
intercepted
the
flash
of
a
wink
to
cousin
egbert
then
as
the
frail
craft
had
all
but
touched
the
dock
and
our
host
had
half
risen
there
was
a
sharp
dipping
of
the
thing
and
he
was
ejected
into
the
chilling
waters
where
he
almost
instantly
sank
there
were
loud
cries
of
alarm
from
all
including
the
woodsman
himself
who
had
kept
the
craft
upright
and
in
these
heartily
joined
the
moment
his
head
appeared
above
the
surface
calling
help
in
the
quite
loudest
of
tones
which
was
thoughtless
enough
as
we
were
close
at
hand
and
could
easily
have
heard
his
ordinary
speaking
voice
the
woods
person
now
stepped
to
the
dock
and
firmly
grasping
the
collar
of
the
drowning
man
hauled
him
out
with
but
little
effort
at
the
same
time
becoming
voluble
with
apologies
and
sympathy
the
rescued
man
however
was
quite
off
his
head
with
rage
and
bluntly
berated
the
fellow
for
having
tried
to
assassinate
him
indeed
he
put
forth
rather
a
torrent
of
execration
but
to
all
of
this
the
fellow
merely
repeated
his
crude
protestations
of
regret
and
astonishment
seeming
to
be
sincerely
grieved
that
his
intentions
should
have
been
doubted
from
his
friends
about
him
the
unfortunate
man
was
receiving
the
most
urgent
advice
to
seek
dry
garments
lest
he
perish
of
chill
whereupon
he
turned
abruptly
to
me
and
cried
well
stupid
don
t
you
see
the
state
that
fellow
has
put
me
in
what
are
you
doing
have
you
lost
your
wits
now
i
had
suffered
a
very
proper
alarm
and
solicitude
for
him
but
the
injustice
of
this
got
a
bit
on
me
i
mean
to
say
i
suddenly
felt
a
bit
of
temper
myself
though
to
be
sure
retaining
my
control
yes
sir
quite
so
sir
i
replied
smoothly
i
ll
have
you
right
as
rain
in
no
time
at
all
sir
and
started
to
conduct
him
off
the
dock
but
now
having
gone
a
little
distance
he
began
to
utter
the
most
violent
threats
against
the
woods
person
declaring
in
fact
he
would
pull
the
fellow
s
nose
however
i
restrained
him
from
rushing
back
as
i
subtly
felt
i
was
wished
to
do
and
he
at
length
consented
again
to
be
led
toward
his
hut
but
now
the
woods
person
called
out
you
re
forgetting
all
your
pretties
by
which
i
saw
him
to
mean
the
fishing
impedimenta
he
had
placed
on
the
dock
and
most
unreasonably
at
this
again
turned
upon
me
wishing
anew
to
be
told
if
i
had
lost
my
wits
and
directing
me
to
fetch
the
stuff
again
i
was
conscious
of
that
within
me
which
no
gentleman
s
man
should
confess
to
i
mean
to
say
i
felt
like
shaking
him
but
i
hastened
back
to
fetch
the
rod
the
creel
the
luncheon
hamper
the
midge
ointment
the
camera
and
other
articles
which
the
woods
fellow
handed
me
with
these
somewhat
awkwardly
carried
i
returned
to
our
still
turbulent
host
more
like
a
volcano
he
was
than
a
man
who
has
had
a
narrow
squeak
from
drowning
and
before
we
had
gone
a
dozen
feet
more
he
again
turned
and
declared
he
would
go
back
and
thrash
the
unspeakable
cad
within
an
inch
of
his
their
relative
sizes
rendering
an
attempt
of
this
sort
quite
too
unwise
i
was
conscious
of
renewed
irritation
toward
him
indeed
the
vulgar
words
oh
stow
that
piffle
swiftly
formed
in
the
back
of
my
mind
but
again
i
controlled
myself
as
the
chap
was
now
sneezing
violently
best
hurry
on
sir
i
said
with
exemplary
tact
one
might
contract
a
severe
from
such
a
wetting
and
further
endeavoured
to
sooth
him
while
i
started
ahead
to
lead
him
away
from
the
fellow
then
there
happened
that
which
fulfilled
my
direst
premonitions
looking
back
from
a
moment
of
calm
the
psychology
of
the
crisis
is
of
a
rudimentary
simplicity
enraged
beyond
measure
at
the
woods
person
yet
retained
a
fine
native
caution
which
counselled
him
to
attempt
no
violence
upon
that
offender
but
his
mental
tension
was
such
that
it
could
be
relieved
only
by
his
attacking
some
one
preferably
some
one
forbidden
to
retaliate
i
walked
there
temptingly
but
a
pace
ahead
of
him
after
my
word
of
advice
i
make
no
defence
of
my
own
course
i
am
aware
there
can
be
none
i
can
only
plead
that
i
had
already
been
vexed
not
a
little
by
his
unjust
accusations
of
stupidity
and
dismiss
with
as
few
words
as
possible
an
incident
that
will
ever
seem
to
me
quite
too
indecently
criminal
briefly
then
with
my
best
not
lower
yourself
sir
forgot
himself
and
i
forgot
myself
it
will
be
recalled
that
i
was
in
front
of
him
but
i
turned
rather
quickly
his
belongings
i
had
carried
were
widely
disseminated
instantly
there
were
wild
outcries
from
the
others
who
had
started
toward
the
main
or
living
house
he
s
killed
charles
i
heard
scream
then
came
the
rumble
of
the
mixer
jackson
kicked
him
first
they
ran
for
us
they
had
reached
us
while
our
host
was
down
even
while
my
fist
was
still
clenched
now
again
the
unfortunate
man
cried
help
as
his
wife
assisted
him
to
his
feet
send
for
an
officer
cried
she
the
man
s
an
anarchist
shouted
her
husband
nonsense
boomed
the
mixer
jackson
got
what
he
was
looking
for
do
it
myself
if
he
kicked
me
oh
maw
oh
mater
cried
her
daughter
tearfully
gee
he
done
it
in
one
punch
i
heard
cousin
egbert
say
with
what
i
was
aghast
to
suspect
was
admiration
effie
trembling
could
but
glare
at
me
and
gasp
mercifully
she
was
beyond
speech
for
the
moment
was
now
painfully
rubbing
his
right
eye
which
was
not
what
he
should
have
done
and
i
said
as
much
beg
pardon
sir
but
one
does
better
with
a
bit
of
raw
how
dare
you
you
great
hulking
brute
cried
his
wife
and
made
as
if
to
shield
her
husband
from
another
attack
from
me
which
i
submit
was
unjust
bill
s
right
said
cousin
egbert
casually
put
a
piece
of
raw
steak
on
it
gee
with
one
wallop
and
then
quite
strangely
for
a
moment
we
all
amiably
discussed
whether
cold
compresses
might
not
be
better
presently
our
host
was
led
off
by
his
wife
effie
followed
them
moaning
oh
oh
oh
in
the
keenest
distress
at
this
i
took
to
my
own
room
in
dire
confusion
making
no
doubt
i
would
presently
be
given
in
charge
and
left
to
languish
in
gaol
perhaps
given
six
months
hard
cousin
egbert
came
to
me
in
a
little
while
and
laughed
heartily
at
my
fear
that
anything
legal
would
be
done
he
also
made
some
compliments
on
the
neatness
of
the
blow
i
had
dealt
but
these
i
found
in
wretched
taste
and
was
begging
him
to
desist
when
the
mixer
entered
and
began
to
speak
much
in
the
same
strain
don
t
you
ever
dare
do
a
thing
like
that
again
she
warned
me
unless
i
got
a
ringside
seat
to
which
i
remained
severely
silent
for
i
felt
my
offence
should
not
be
made
light
of
three
rousing
cheers
exclaimed
cousin
egbert
whereat
the
two
most
unfeelingly
went
through
a
vivid
pantomime
of
cheering
our
host
i
understood
had
his
dinner
in
bed
that
night
and
throughout
the
evening
as
i
sat
solitary
in
remorse
came
the
mocking
strains
of
another
of
their
american
folksongs
with
the
refrain
you
made
me
what
i
am
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
i
conceived
it
to
be
the
mixer
and
cousin
egbert
who
did
this
and
considering
the
plight
of
our
host
i
thought
it
in
the
worst
possible
taste
i
had
raised
my
hand
against
the
one
american
i
had
met
who
was
at
all
times
vogue
and
not
only
this
for
i
now
recalled
a
certain
phrase
i
had
flung
out
as
i
stood
over
him
ranting
indeed
no
better
than
an
anarchist
a
phrase
which
showed
my
poor
culture
to
be
the
flimsiest
veneer
late
in
the
night
as
i
lay
looking
back
on
the
frightful
scene
i
recalled
with
wonder
a
swift
picture
of
cousin
egbert
caught
as
i
once
looked
back
to
the
dock
he
had
most
amazingly
shaken
the
woods
person
by
the
hand
quickly
but
with
marked
cordiality
and
yet
i
am
quite
certain
he
had
never
been
presented
to
the
fellow
promptly
the
next
morning
came
the
dreaded
summons
to
meet
effie
i
was
of
course
prepared
to
accept
instant
dismissal
without
a
character
if
indeed
i
were
not
to
be
given
in
charge
i
found
her
wearing
an
expression
of
the
utmost
sternness
erect
and
formidable
by
the
now
silent
phonograph
cousin
egbert
who
was
present
also
wore
an
expression
of
sternness
though
i
perceived
him
to
wink
at
me
i
really
don
t
know
what
we
re
to
do
with
you
ruggles
began
the
stricken
woman
and
so
done
out
she
plainly
was
that
i
at
once
felt
the
warmest
sympathy
for
her
as
she
continued
first
you
lead
poor
cousin
egbert
into
a
drunken
debauch
cousin
egbert
here
coughed
nervously
and
eyed
me
with
strong
condemnation
then
you
behave
like
a
murderer
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
at
this
i
saw
there
was
little
i
could
say
except
that
i
had
coarsely
given
way
to
the
brute
in
me
and
yet
i
knew
i
should
try
to
explain
i
dare
say
madam
it
may
have
been
because
was
quite
sober
at
the
unfortunate
of
course
charles
was
sober
the
idea
what
of
it
i
was
remembering
an
occasion
at
when
lord
ivor
cradleigh
behaved
toward
me
somewhat
as
did
last
night
and
when
my
own
deportment
was
quite
all
that
could
be
wished
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
it
was
because
his
lordship
was
how
shall
i
say
quite
far
gone
in
liquor
at
the
time
so
that
i
could
without
loss
of
dignity
pass
it
off
as
a
mere
prank
indeed
he
regarded
it
as
such
himself
performing
the
act
with
a
good
nature
that
i
found
quite
irresistible
and
i
am
certain
that
neither
his
lordship
nor
i
have
ever
thought
the
less
of
each
other
because
of
it
i
revert
to
this
merely
to
show
that
i
have
not
always
acted
in
a
ruffianly
manner
under
these
circumstances
it
seems
rather
to
depend
upon
how
the
thing
is
done
the
mood
of
the
performer
his
mental
state
had
been
pardon
me
quite
drunk
i
feel
that
the
outcome
would
have
been
happier
for
us
all
so
far
as
i
have
thought
along
these
lines
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
is
to
be
kicked
at
all
one
must
be
kicked
i
mean
to
say
with
a
certain
camaraderie
a
lightness
a
gayety
a
genuine
that
for
the
moment
expresses
itself
uncouthly
an
element
i
regret
to
say
that
was
conspicuously
lacking
from
the
brief
activities
of
i
never
heard
such
crazy
talk
responded
effie
and
really
i
never
saw
such
a
man
as
you
are
for
wanting
people
to
become
disgustingly
drunk
you
made
poor
cousin
egbert
and
jeff
tuttle
act
like
beasts
and
now
nothing
will
satisfy
you
but
that
charles
should
roll
in
the
gutter
such
dissipated
talk
i
never
did
hear
and
poor
charles
rarely
taking
anything
but
a
single
glass
of
wine
it
upsets
him
so
even
our
reception
punch
he
finds
too
stimulating
i
mean
to
say
the
woman
had
cleanly
missed
my
point
for
never
have
i
advocated
the
use
of
fermented
liquors
to
excess
but
i
saw
it
was
no
good
trying
to
tell
her
this
and
the
worst
of
it
she
went
rapidly
on
cousin
egbert
here
is
acting
stranger
than
i
ever
knew
him
to
act
he
swears
if
he
can
t
keep
you
he
ll
never
have
another
man
and
you
know
yourself
what
that
means
in
his
case
and
pettengill
saying
she
means
to
employ
you
herself
if
we
let
you
go
heaven
knows
what
the
poor
woman
can
be
thinking
of
oh
it
s
awful
and
everything
was
going
so
beautifully
of
course
charles
would
simply
never
be
brought
to
accept
an
apology
i
am
only
too
anxious
to
make
one
i
submitted
here
s
the
poor
fellow
now
said
cousin
egbert
almost
gleefully
and
our
host
entered
he
carried
a
patch
over
his
right
eye
and
was
not
attired
for
sport
on
the
lake
but
in
a
dark
morning
suit
of
quietly
beautiful
lines
that
i
thought
showed
a
fine
sense
of
the
situation
he
shot
me
one
superior
glance
from
his
left
eye
and
turned
to
effie
i
see
you
still
harbour
the
ruffian
i
ve
just
given
him
a
said
effie
plainly
ill
at
ease
and
he
says
it
was
all
because
you
were
sober
that
if
you
d
been
in
the
state
lord
ivor
cradleigh
was
the
time
it
happened
at
he
wouldn
t
have
done
anything
to
you
what
s
this
what
s
this
lord
ivor
cradleigh
the
man
seemed
to
be
curiously
interested
by
the
mere
names
in
spite
of
himself
his
lordship
was
at
for
the
shooting
i
suppose
this
most
amazingly
to
me
a
house
party
at
whitsuntide
sir
i
explained
ah
and
you
say
his
lordship
was
oh
quite
quite
in
his
cups
sir
if
i
might
explain
it
was
that
sir
its
being
done
under
circumstances
and
in
a
certain
entirely
genial
spirit
of
irritation
to
which
i
could
take
no
offence
sir
his
lordship
is
a
very
decent
sort
sir
i
ve
known
him
intimately
for
dear
dear
he
replied
too
bad
too
bad
and
i
dare
say
you
thought
me
out
of
temper
last
night
nothing
of
the
sort
you
should
have
taken
it
in
quite
the
same
spirit
as
you
did
from
lord
ivor
it
seemed
different
sir
i
said
firmly
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
of
putting
it
so
i
felt
quite
offended
by
your
manner
i
missed
from
it
at
the
most
critical
moment
as
one
might
say
a
certain
urbanity
that
i
found
in
his
lordship
well
well
well
it
s
too
bad
really
i
m
quite
aware
that
i
show
a
sort
of
brusqueness
at
times
but
mind
you
it
s
all
on
the
surface
had
you
known
me
as
long
as
you
ve
known
his
lordship
i
dare
say
you
d
have
noticed
the
same
rough
urbanity
in
me
as
well
i
rather
fancy
some
of
us
over
here
don
t
do
those
things
so
very
differently
a
few
of
us
at
i
m
glad
indeed
to
hear
it
sir
it
s
only
necessary
to
understand
that
there
is
a
certain
mood
in
which
one
really
can
not
permit
one
s
self
to
be
you
perceive
i
perfectly
perfectly
said
he
and
i
can
only
express
my
regret
that
you
should
have
mistaken
my
own
mood
which
i
am
confident
was
exactly
the
thing
his
lordship
might
have
i
gladly
accept
your
apology
sir
i
returned
quickly
as
i
should
have
accepted
his
lordship
s
had
his
manner
permitted
any
misapprehension
on
my
part
and
in
return
i
wish
to
apologize
most
contritely
for
the
phrase
i
applied
to
you
just
after
it
happened
sir
i
rarely
use
strong
language
but
i
remember
hearing
none
said
he
i
regret
to
say
sir
that
i
called
you
a
blighted
little
mug
you
needn
t
have
mentioned
it
he
replied
with
just
a
trace
of
sharpness
and
i
trust
that
in
future
i
am
sure
sir
that
in
future
you
will
give
me
no
occasion
to
misunderstand
your
intentions
no
more
than
would
his
lordship
i
added
as
he
raised
his
brows
thus
in
a
manner
wholly
unexpected
was
a
frightful
situation
eased
off
i
m
so
glad
it
s
settled
cried
effie
who
had
listened
almost
breathlessly
to
our
exchange
i
fancy
i
settled
it
as
cradleigh
would
have
eh
ruggles
and
the
man
actually
smiled
at
me
entirely
so
sir
said
i
if
only
it
doesn
t
get
out
said
effie
now
we
shouldn
t
want
it
known
in
red
gap
think
of
the
talk
certainly
rejoined
jauntily
we
are
all
here
above
gossip
about
an
affair
of
that
sort
i
am
sure
he
broke
off
and
looked
uneasily
at
cousin
egbert
who
coughed
into
his
hand
and
looked
out
over
the
lake
before
he
spoke
what
would
i
want
to
tell
a
thing
like
that
for
he
demanded
indignantly
as
if
an
accusation
had
been
made
against
him
but
i
saw
his
eyes
glitter
with
an
evil
light
an
hour
later
i
chanced
to
be
with
him
in
our
detached
hut
when
the
mixer
entered
what
happened
she
demanded
what
do
you
reckon
happened
returned
cousin
egbert
they
get
to
talking
about
lord
ivy
craddles
or
some
guy
and
before
we
know
it
belknap
hyphen
jackson
is
apologizing
to
bill
no
bellowed
the
mixer
sure
did
he
affirmed
cousin
egbert
here
they
grasped
each
other
s
arms
and
did
a
rude
native
dance
about
the
room
nor
did
they
desist
when
i
sought
to
explain
that
the
name
was
not
at
all
ivy
craddles
chapter
seven
now
once
more
it
seemed
that
for
a
time
i
might
lead
a
sanely
ordered
existence
not
for
long
did
i
hope
it
i
think
i
had
become
resigned
to
the
unending
series
of
shocks
that
seemed
to
compose
the
daily
life
in
north
america
few
had
been
my
peaceful
hours
since
that
fatal
evening
in
paris
and
the
shocks
had
become
increasingly
violent
when
i
tried
to
picture
what
the
next
might
be
i
found
myself
shuddering
for
the
present
like
a
stag
that
has
eluded
the
hounds
but
hears
their
distant
baying
i
lay
panting
in
momentary
security
gathering
breath
for
some
new
course
i
mean
to
say
one
couldn
t
tell
what
might
happen
next
again
and
again
i
found
myself
coming
all
over
frightened
wholly
restored
i
was
now
in
the
esteem
of
who
never
tired
of
discussing
with
me
our
own
life
and
people
indeed
he
was
quite
the
most
intelligent
foreigner
i
had
encountered
i
may
seem
to
exaggerate
in
the
american
fashion
but
i
doubt
if
a
single
one
of
the
others
could
have
named
the
counties
of
england
or
the
present
lord
mayor
of
london
our
host
was
not
like
that
also
he
early
gave
me
to
know
that
he
felt
quite
as
we
do
concerning
the
rebellion
of
our
american
colonies
holding
it
a
matter
for
the
deepest
regret
and
justly
proud
he
was
of
the
circumstance
that
at
the
time
of
that
rebellion
his
own
family
had
put
all
possible
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
traitorous
washington
to
be
sure
i
dare
say
he
may
have
boasted
a
bit
in
this
it
was
during
the
long
journey
across
america
which
we
now
set
out
upon
that
i
came
to
this
sympathetic
understanding
of
his
character
and
of
the
chagrin
he
constantly
felt
at
being
compelled
to
live
among
people
with
whom
he
could
have
as
little
sympathy
as
i
myself
had
this
journey
began
pleasantly
enough
and
through
the
farming
counties
of
philadelphia
ohio
and
chicago
was
not
without
interest
beyond
came
an
incredibly
large
region
much
like
the
steppes
of
siberia
i
fancy
vast
uninhabited
stretches
of
heath
and
down
with
but
here
and
there
some
rude
settlement
about
which
the
poor
peasants
would
eagerly
assemble
as
our
train
passed
through
i
could
not
wonder
that
our
own
travellers
have
always
spoken
so
disparagingly
of
the
american
civilization
it
is
a
country
that
would
never
do
with
us
although
we
lived
in
this
train
a
matter
of
nearly
four
days
i
fancy
not
a
single
person
dressed
for
dinner
as
one
would
on
shipboard
even
dined
in
a
though
he
wore
gloves
constantly
by
day
which
was
more
than
i
could
get
cousin
egbert
to
do
as
we
went
ever
farther
over
these
leagues
of
fen
and
fell
and
rolling
veldt
i
could
but
speculate
unquietly
as
to
what
sort
of
place
the
red
gap
must
be
a
residential
town
for
gentlemen
and
families
i
had
understood
with
a
little
colony
of
people
that
really
mattered
as
i
had
gathered
from
effie
and
yet
i
was
unable
to
divine
their
object
in
going
so
far
away
to
live
one
goes
to
distant
places
for
the
winter
sports
or
for
big
game
shooting
but
this
seemed
rather
grotesquely
perverse
little
did
i
then
dream
of
the
spiritual
agencies
that
were
to
insure
my
gradual
understanding
of
the
town
and
its
people
unsuspectingly
i
fronted
a
future
so
wildly
improbable
that
no
power
could
have
made
me
credit
it
had
it
then
been
foretold
by
the
most
rarely
endowed
gypsy
it
is
always
now
with
a
sort
of
terror
that
i
look
back
to
those
last
moments
before
my
destiny
had
unfolded
far
enough
to
be
actually
alarming
i
was
as
one
floating
in
fancied
security
down
the
calm
river
above
their
famous
niagara
falls
to
be
presently
dashed
without
warning
over
the
horrible
verge
i
mean
to
say
i
never
suspected
our
last
day
of
travel
arrived
we
were
now
in
a
roughened
and
most
untidy
welter
of
mountain
and
jungle
and
glen
with
violent
tarns
and
bleak
bits
of
moorland
that
had
all
too
evidently
never
known
the
calming
touch
of
the
landscape
gardener
a
region
moreover
peopled
by
a
much
more
lawless
appearing
peasantry
than
i
had
observed
back
in
the
chicago
counties
people
for
the
most
part
quite
wretchedly
gotten
up
and
distinctly
of
the
lower
or
working
classes
late
in
the
afternoon
our
train
wound
out
of
a
narrow
cutting
and
into
a
valley
that
broadened
away
on
every
hand
to
distant
mountains
beyond
doubt
this
prospect
could
in
a
loose
way
of
speaking
be
called
scenery
but
of
too
violent
a
character
it
was
for
cultivated
tastes
then
as
my
eye
caught
the
vague
outlines
of
a
settlement
or
village
in
the
midst
of
this
valley
cousin
egbert
who
also
looked
from
the
coach
window
amazed
me
by
crying
out
there
she
is
little
old
red
gap
the
fastest
growing
town
in
the
state
if
any
one
should
ask
yes
sir
i
ll
try
to
remember
sir
i
said
wondering
why
i
should
be
asked
this
garden
spot
of
the
world
he
added
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
to
which
i
made
no
response
for
this
was
too
preposterous
nearing
the
place
our
train
passed
an
immense
hoarding
erected
by
the
roadway
a
score
of
feet
high
i
should
say
and
at
least
a
dozen
times
as
long
upon
which
was
emblazoned
in
mammoth
red
letters
on
a
black
ground
your
eye
on
red
gap
at
either
end
of
this
lettering
was
painted
a
gigantic
staring
human
eye
regarding
this
monstrosity
with
startled
interest
i
heard
myself
addressed
by
the
sort
of
vulgarity
i
m
obliged
to
contend
with
said
he
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
toward
the
hoarding
indeed
the
thing
lacked
refinement
in
its
diction
while
the
painted
eyes
were
not
art
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
the
work
of
our
precious
chamber
of
commerce
he
added
though
i
pleaded
with
them
for
days
and
it
s
a
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
with
us
sir
i
said
it
s
what
one
has
to
expect
from
a
commercialized
bourgeoise
he
returned
bitterly
and
even
our
association
the
city
beautiful
of
which
i
was
president
helped
to
erect
the
thing
of
course
i
resigned
at
naturally
sir
the
colours
are
and
the
words
a
mere
blatant
boast
he
groaned
and
left
me
for
we
were
now
well
into
a
suburb
of
detached
villas
many
of
them
of
a
squalid
character
and
presently
we
had
halted
at
the
station
about
this
bleak
affair
was
the
usual
gathering
of
peasantry
and
the
common
people
villagers
agricultural
labourers
and
the
like
and
these
at
once
showed
a
tremendous
interest
in
our
party
many
of
them
hailing
various
members
of
us
with
a
quite
offensive
familiarity
of
course
bore
himself
through
this
with
a
proper
aloofness
as
did
his
wife
and
effie
but
i
heard
the
mixer
booming
salutations
right
and
left
it
was
cousin
egbert
however
who
most
embarrassed
me
by
the
freedom
of
his
manner
with
these
persons
he
shook
hands
warmly
with
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
and
these
hailed
him
with
rude
shouts
dealt
him
smart
blows
on
the
back
and
forming
a
circle
about
him
escorted
him
to
a
carriage
where
effie
and
i
awaited
him
here
the
driver
a
loutish
and
familiar
youth
also
seized
his
hand
and
with
some
crude
effect
of
oratory
shouted
to
the
crowd
what
s
the
matter
with
to
this
with
a
flourish
of
their
impossible
hats
they
quickly
responded
in
unison
he
s
all
right
accenting
the
first
word
terrifically
then
to
the
immense
relief
of
effie
and
myself
he
was
released
and
we
were
driven
quickly
off
from
the
raffish
set
through
their
regent
and
bond
streets
we
went
though
i
mean
to
say
they
were
on
an
unbelievably
small
or
village
scale
to
an
outlying
region
of
detached
villas
that
doubtless
would
be
their
john
s
wood
but
my
efforts
to
observe
closely
were
distracted
by
the
extraordinary
freedom
with
which
our
driver
essayed
to
chat
with
us
saying
he
guessed
we
were
glad
to
get
back
to
god
s
country
and
things
of
a
similar
intimate
nature
this
was
even
more
embarrassing
to
effie
than
it
was
to
me
since
she
more
than
once
felt
obliged
to
answer
the
fellow
with
a
feigned
cordiality
relieved
i
was
when
we
drew
up
before
the
town
house
of
the
flouds
set
well
back
from
the
driveway
in
a
faded
stretch
of
common
it
was
of
rather
a
garbled
architecture
with
the
tudor
late
gothic
and
french
renaissance
so
intermixed
that
one
was
puzzled
to
separate
the
periods
nor
was
the
result
so
vast
as
this
might
sound
hardly
would
the
thing
have
made
a
wing
of
the
manor
house
at
the
common
or
small
park
before
it
was
shielded
from
the
main
thoroughfare
by
a
fence
of
iron
palings
and
back
of
this
on
either
side
of
a
gravelled
walk
that
led
to
the
main
entrance
were
two
stags
not
badly
sculptured
from
metal
once
inside
i
began
to
suspect
that
my
position
was
going
to
be
more
than
a
bit
dicky
i
mean
to
say
it
was
not
an
establishment
in
our
sense
of
the
word
being
staffed
apparently
by
two
china
persons
who
performed
the
functions
of
cook
housemaids
footmen
butler
and
housekeeper
there
was
not
even
a
billiard
room
during
the
ensuing
hour
marked
by
the
arrival
of
our
luggage
and
the
unpacking
of
boxes
i
meditated
profoundly
over
the
difficulties
of
my
situation
in
a
wilderness
beyond
the
confines
of
civilization
i
would
undoubtedly
be
compelled
to
endure
the
hardships
of
the
pioneer
yet
for
the
present
i
resolved
to
let
no
inkling
of
my
dismay
escape
the
evening
meal
over
dinner
in
but
the
barest
technical
sense
i
sat
alone
in
my
own
room
meditating
thus
darkly
nor
was
i
at
all
cheered
by
the
voice
of
cousin
egbert
who
sang
in
his
own
room
adjoining
i
had
found
this
to
be
a
habit
of
his
and
his
songs
are
always
dolorous
to
the
last
degree
now
for
example
while
life
seemed
all
too
black
to
me
he
sang
a
favourite
of
his
the
pathetic
ballad
of
two
small
children
evidently
begging
in
a
business
thoroughfare
lone
and
weary
through
the
streets
we
wander
for
we
have
no
place
to
lay
our
head
not
a
friend
is
left
on
earth
to
shelter
us
for
both
our
parents
now
are
it
was
a
fair
crumpler
in
my
then
mood
it
made
me
wish
to
be
out
of
north
america
made
me
long
for
london
london
with
a
yellow
fog
and
its
greasy
pavements
where
one
knew
what
to
apprehend
i
wanted
him
to
stop
but
still
he
atrociously
sang
in
his
high
cracked
voice
dear
mother
died
when
we
were
both
young
and
father
built
for
us
a
home
but
now
he
s
killed
by
falling
timbers
and
we
are
left
here
all
i
dare
say
i
should
have
rushed
madly
into
the
night
had
there
been
another
verse
but
now
he
was
still
a
moment
later
however
he
entered
my
room
with
the
suggestion
that
i
stroll
about
the
village
streets
with
him
he
having
a
mission
to
perform
for
effie
i
had
already
heard
her
confide
this
to
him
he
was
to
proceed
to
the
office
of
their
newspaper
and
there
leave
with
the
press
chap
a
notice
of
our
arrival
which
from
day
to
day
she
had
been
composing
on
the
train
i
just
got
to
leave
this
here
piece
for
the
he
said
then
we
can
sasshay
up
and
down
for
a
while
and
meet
some
of
the
how
profoundly
may
our
whole
destiny
be
affected
by
the
mood
of
an
idle
moment
by
some
superficial
indecision
mere
fruit
of
a
transient
unrest
we
lightly
debate
we
hesitate
we
yawn
unconscious
of
the
brink
we
decline
a
suggested
course
then
lightly
accept
from
sheer
ennui
and
life
as
i
have
read
in
a
quite
meritorious
poem
is
never
the
same
it
was
thus
i
now
toyed
there
with
my
fate
in
my
hands
as
might
a
child
have
toyed
with
a
bauble
i
mean
to
say
i
was
looking
for
nothing
thick
she
s
wrote
a
very
fancy
piece
for
that
newspaper
cousin
egbert
went
on
handing
me
the
sheets
of
manuscript
idly
i
glanced
down
the
pages
yesterday
saw
the
return
to
red
gap
of
mrs
senator
james
knox
floud
and
egbert
floud
from
their
extensive
european
tour
it
began
farther
i
caught
vagrant
lines
salient
phrases
the
social
leader
of
our
north
side
set
planning
a
series
of
entertainments
for
the
approaching
social
season
that
promise
to
eclipse
all
previous
gayeties
of
red
gap
s
smart
set
holding
the
reins
of
social
leadership
with
a
firm
grasp
distinguished
for
her
social
graces
and
tact
as
a
hostess
their
palatial
home
on
ophir
avenue
the
scene
of
so
much
of
the
smart
social
life
that
has
distinguished
our
beautiful
it
left
me
rather
unmoved
from
my
depression
even
the
concluding
note
the
flouds
are
accompanied
by
their
english
manservant
secured
through
the
kind
offices
of
the
brother
of
his
lordship
earl
of
brinstead
the
english
peer
who
will
no
doubt
do
much
to
impart
to
the
coming
functions
that
air
of
smartness
which
distinguishes
the
highest
social
circles
of
london
paris
and
other
capitals
of
the
great
world
of
some
mess
of
words
that
observed
cousin
egbert
and
it
did
indeed
seem
to
be
rather
intimately
phrased
better
come
along
with
me
he
again
urged
there
was
a
moment
s
fateful
silence
then
quite
mechanically
i
arose
and
prepared
to
accompany
him
in
the
hall
below
i
handed
him
his
evening
stick
and
gloves
which
he
absently
took
from
me
and
we
presently
traversed
that
street
of
houses
much
in
the
fashion
of
the
floud
house
and
nearly
all
boasting
some
sculptured
bit
of
wild
life
on
their
terraces
it
was
a
calm
night
of
late
summer
all
nature
seemed
at
peace
i
looked
aloft
and
reflected
that
the
same
stars
were
shining
upon
the
civilization
i
had
left
so
far
behind
as
we
walked
i
lost
myself
in
musing
pensively
upon
this
curious
astronomical
fact
and
upon
the
further
vicissitudes
to
which
i
would
surely
be
exposed
i
compared
myself
whimsically
to
an
explorer
chap
who
has
ventured
among
a
tribe
of
natives
and
who
must
seem
to
adopt
their
weird
manners
and
customs
to
save
himself
from
their
fanatic
violence
from
this
i
was
aroused
by
cousin
egbert
who
with
sudden
dismay
regarding
his
stick
and
gloves
uttered
a
low
cry
of
anguish
and
thrust
them
into
my
hands
before
i
had
divined
his
purpose
you
ll
have
to
tote
them
there
things
he
swiftly
explained
i
forgot
where
i
i
demurred
sharply
but
he
would
not
listen
i
didn
t
mind
it
so
much
in
paris
and
europe
where
i
ain
t
so
very
well
known
but
my
good
gosh
man
this
is
my
home
town
you
ll
have
to
take
them
people
won
t
notice
it
in
you
so
much
you
being
a
foreigner
without
further
objection
i
wearily
took
them
finding
a
desperate
drollery
in
being
regarded
as
a
foreigner
whereas
i
was
simply
alone
among
foreigners
but
i
knew
that
cousin
egbert
lacked
the
subtlety
to
grasp
this
point
of
view
and
made
no
effort
to
lay
it
before
him
it
was
clear
to
me
then
i
think
that
he
would
forever
remain
socially
impossible
though
perhaps
no
bad
sort
from
a
mere
human
point
of
view
we
continued
our
stroll
turning
presently
from
this
residential
avenue
to
a
street
of
small
unlighted
shops
and
from
this
into
a
wider
and
brilliantly
lighted
thoroughfare
of
larger
shops
where
my
companion
presently
began
to
greet
native
acquaintances
and
now
once
more
he
affected
that
fashion
of
presenting
me
to
his
friends
that
i
had
so
deplored
in
paris
his
own
greeting
made
he
would
call
out
heartily
shake
hands
with
my
friend
colonel
ruggles
nor
would
he
heed
my
protests
at
this
so
that
in
sheer
desperation
i
presently
ceased
making
them
reflecting
that
after
all
we
were
encountering
the
street
classes
of
the
town
at
a
score
of
such
casual
meetings
i
was
thus
presented
for
he
seemed
to
know
quite
almost
every
one
and
at
times
there
would
be
a
group
of
natives
about
us
on
the
pavement
twice
we
went
into
saloons
as
they
rather
pretentiously
style
their
public
houses
where
cousin
egbert
would
stand
the
drinks
for
all
present
not
omitting
each
time
to
present
me
formally
to
the
in
all
these
instances
i
was
at
once
asked
what
i
thought
of
their
town
which
was
at
first
rather
embarrassing
as
i
was
confident
that
any
frank
disclosure
of
my
opinion
being
necessarily
hurried
might
easily
be
misunderstood
i
at
length
devised
a
conventional
formula
of
praise
which
although
feeling
a
frightful
fool
i
delivered
each
time
thereafter
thus
we
progressed
the
length
of
their
commercial
centre
the
incidents
varying
but
little
hello
you
old
shellback
when
did
you
come
off
the
trail
just
got
in
my
lands
but
it
s
good
to
be
back
billy
shake
hands
with
my
friend
colonel
i
mean
to
say
the
persons
were
not
all
named
billy
that
being
used
only
by
way
of
illustration
sometimes
they
would
be
called
doc
or
hank
or
al
or
nor
was
my
companion
invariably
called
and
were
also
epithets
much
in
favour
with
his
friends
at
the
end
of
this
street
we
at
length
paused
before
the
office
as
i
saw
of
the
red
gap
daily
and
cousin
egbert
entered
here
but
came
out
almost
at
once
henshaw
ain
t
there
and
she
said
i
got
to
be
sure
and
give
him
this
here
piece
personally
so
come
on
he
s
up
to
a
a
social
function
sir
i
asked
no
just
a
up
in
judge
ballard
s
front
yard
to
raise
money
for
new
uniforms
for
the
band
that
s
what
the
boy
said
in
but
would
it
not
be
highly
improper
for
me
to
appear
there
sir
i
at
once
objected
i
fear
it
s
not
done
shucks
he
insisted
don
t
talk
foolish
that
way
you
re
a
peach
of
a
little
mixer
all
right
come
on
everybody
goes
they
ll
even
let
me
in
i
can
give
this
here
piece
to
henshaw
and
then
we
ll
spend
a
little
money
to
help
the
my
misgivings
were
by
no
means
dispelled
yet
as
the
affair
seemed
to
be
public
rather
than
smart
i
allowed
myself
to
be
led
on
into
another
street
of
residences
we
turned
and
after
a
brisk
walk
i
was
able
to
identify
the
front
yard
of
which
my
companion
had
spoken
the
strains
of
an
orchestra
came
to
us
and
from
the
trees
and
shrubbery
gleamed
the
lights
of
paper
lanterns
i
could
discern
tents
and
marquees
a
throng
of
people
moving
among
them
nearer
i
observed
a
refreshment
pavilion
and
a
dancing
platform
reaching
the
gate
cousin
egbert
paid
for
us
an
entrance
fee
of
two
shillings
to
a
young
lady
in
gypsy
costume
whom
he
greeted
cordially
as
beryl
mae
not
omitting
to
present
me
to
her
as
colonel
ruggles
we
moved
into
the
thick
of
the
crowd
there
was
much
laughter
and
hearty
speech
and
it
at
once
occurred
to
me
that
cousin
egbert
had
been
right
it
would
not
be
an
assemblage
of
people
that
mattered
but
rather
of
small
tradesmen
artisans
and
the
like
with
whom
i
could
properly
mingle
my
companion
was
greeted
by
several
of
the
throng
to
whom
he
in
turn
presented
me
among
them
after
a
bit
to
a
slight
person
wearing
thick
whom
i
understood
to
be
the
pressman
we
were
in
search
of
nervous
of
manner
he
was
and
preoccupied
with
a
notebook
in
which
he
frantically
scribbled
items
from
time
to
time
yet
no
sooner
was
i
presented
to
him
than
he
began
a
quizzing
sort
of
conversation
with
me
that
lasted
near
a
i
should
say
very
interested
he
seemed
to
hear
of
my
previous
life
having
in
full
measure
that
na√Øve
curiosity
about
one
which
americans
take
so
little
pains
to
hide
like
the
other
natives
i
had
met
that
evening
he
was
especially
concerned
to
know
what
i
thought
of
red
gap
the
chat
was
not
at
all
unpleasant
as
he
seemed
to
be
a
person
and
it
was
not
without
regret
that
i
noted
the
approach
of
cousin
egbert
in
company
with
a
lady
in
oriental
garb
carrying
a
tambourine
mrs
ballard
allow
me
to
make
you
acquainted
with
my
friend
colonel
ruggles
thus
cousin
egbert
performed
his
ceremony
the
lady
grasped
my
hand
with
great
cordiality
you
men
have
monopolized
the
colonel
long
enough
she
began
with
a
large
coquetry
that
i
found
not
unpleasing
and
firmly
grasping
my
arm
she
led
me
off
in
the
direction
of
the
refreshment
pavilion
where
i
was
playfully
let
to
know
that
i
should
purchase
her
bits
of
refreshment
coffee
an
ice
things
of
that
sort
through
it
all
she
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
banter
from
time
to
time
presenting
me
to
other
women
young
and
old
who
happened
about
us
all
of
whom
betrayed
an
interest
in
my
personality
that
was
not
unflattering
even
from
this
commoner
sort
of
the
town
s
people
nor
would
my
new
friend
release
me
when
she
had
refreshed
herself
but
had
it
that
i
must
dance
with
her
i
had
now
to
confess
that
i
was
unskilled
in
the
native
american
folk
dances
which
i
had
observed
being
performed
whereupon
she
briskly
chided
me
for
my
backwardness
but
commanded
a
valse
from
the
musicians
and
this
we
danced
together
i
may
here
say
that
i
am
not
without
a
certain
finesse
on
the
and
i
rather
enjoyed
the
momentary
abandon
with
this
village
worthy
indeed
i
had
rather
enjoyed
the
whole
affair
though
i
felt
that
my
manner
was
gradually
marking
me
as
one
apart
from
the
natives
made
conscious
i
was
of
a
more
finished
a
suaver
formality
in
myself
the
ballard
i
had
met
came
at
length
to
be
by
way
of
tapping
me
coquettishly
with
her
tambourine
in
our
lighter
moments
also
my
presence
increasingly
drew
attention
more
and
more
of
the
village
belles
and
matrons
demanding
in
their
hearty
way
to
be
presented
to
me
indeed
the
society
was
vastly
more
enlivening
i
reflected
than
i
had
found
it
in
a
similar
walk
of
life
at
home
rather
regretfully
i
left
with
cousin
egbert
who
found
me
at
last
in
one
of
the
tents
having
my
palm
read
by
the
gypsy
young
person
who
had
taken
our
fees
at
the
gate
of
course
i
am
aware
that
she
was
probably
without
any
real
gifts
for
this
science
as
so
few
are
who
undertake
it
at
charity
bazaars
yet
she
told
me
not
a
few
things
that
were
significant
that
my
somewhat
cold
exterior
and
air
of
sternness
were
but
a
mask
to
shield
a
nature
that
i
possessed
great
firmness
of
character
and
was
fond
of
nature
she
added
peculiarly
at
the
last
i
see
trouble
ahead
but
you
are
not
to
be
downcast
the
skies
will
it
was
at
this
point
that
cousin
egbert
found
me
and
after
he
had
warned
the
young
woman
that
i
was
some
mixer
we
departed
not
until
we
had
reached
the
floud
home
did
he
discover
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
to
hand
the
effie
s
manuscript
dog
on
the
luck
said
he
in
his
quaint
tone
of
exasperation
here
i
ve
went
and
forgot
to
give
effie
s
piece
to
the
he
sighed
ruefully
well
s
another
and
so
the
die
was
cast
was
indeed
another
day
yet
i
fell
asleep
on
a
memory
of
the
evening
that
brought
me
a
sort
of
shamed
pleasure
that
i
had
falsely
borne
the
stick
and
gloves
of
cousin
egbert
i
knew
they
had
given
me
rather
an
air
chapter
eight
i
have
never
been
able
to
recall
the
precise
moment
the
next
morning
when
i
began
to
feel
a
strange
disquietude
but
the
opening
hours
of
the
day
were
marked
by
a
series
of
occurrences
slight
in
themselves
yet
so
cumulatively
ominous
that
they
seemed
to
lower
above
me
like
a
cloud
of
menace
looking
from
my
window
shortly
after
the
rising
hour
i
observed
a
paper
boy
pass
through
the
street
whistling
a
popular
melody
as
he
ran
up
to
toss
folded
journals
into
doorways
something
i
can
not
explain
went
through
me
even
then
some
premonition
of
disaster
slinking
furtively
under
my
casual
reflection
that
even
in
this
remote
wild
the
public
press
was
not
unknown
half
an
hour
later
the
telephone
rang
in
a
lower
room
and
i
heard
effie
speak
in
answer
an
unusual
note
in
her
voice
caused
me
to
listen
more
attentively
i
stepped
outside
my
door
to
some
one
she
was
expressing
amazement
doubt
and
quick
impatience
which
seemed
to
culminate
after
she
had
again
listened
in
a
piercing
cry
of
consternation
the
term
is
not
too
strong
evidently
by
the
unknown
speaker
she
had
been
first
puzzled
then
startled
then
horrified
and
now
as
her
anguished
cry
still
rang
in
my
ears
that
snaky
premonition
of
evil
again
writhed
across
my
consciousness
presently
i
heard
the
front
door
open
and
close
peering
into
the
hallway
below
i
saw
that
she
had
secured
the
newspaper
i
had
seen
dropped
her
own
door
now
closed
upon
her
i
waited
listening
intently
something
told
me
that
the
incident
was
not
closed
a
brief
interval
elapsed
and
she
was
again
at
the
telephone
excitedly
demanding
to
be
put
through
to
a
number
come
at
once
i
heard
her
cry
it
s
unspeakable
there
isn
t
a
moment
to
lose
come
as
you
are
hereupon
banging
the
receiver
into
its
place
with
frenzied
roughness
she
ran
halfway
up
the
stairs
to
shout
egbert
floud
egbert
floud
you
march
right
down
here
this
minute
sir
from
his
room
i
heard
an
alarmed
response
and
a
moment
later
knew
that
he
had
joined
her
the
door
closed
upon
them
but
high
words
reached
me
mostly
the
words
of
effie
they
were
though
i
could
detect
muffled
retorts
from
the
other
wondering
what
this
could
portend
i
noted
from
my
window
some
ten
minutes
later
the
hurried
arrival
of
the
the
husband
clenched
a
crumpled
newspaper
in
one
hand
and
both
he
and
his
wife
betrayed
signs
to
the
trained
eye
of
having
performed
hasty
toilets
for
this
early
call
as
the
door
of
the
closed
upon
them
there
ensued
a
terrific
outburst
carrying
a
rich
general
effect
of
astounded
rage
some
moments
the
sinister
chorus
continued
then
a
door
sharply
opened
and
i
heard
my
own
name
cried
out
by
effie
in
a
tone
that
caused
me
to
shudder
rapidly
descending
the
stairs
i
entered
the
room
to
face
the
excited
group
cousin
egbert
crouched
on
a
sofa
in
a
far
corner
like
a
hunted
beast
but
the
others
were
standing
and
all
glared
at
me
furiously
the
ladies
addressed
me
simultaneously
one
of
them
i
believe
asking
me
what
i
meant
by
it
and
the
other
demanding
how
dared
i
which
had
the
sole
effect
of
adding
to
my
bewilderment
nor
did
the
words
of
cousin
egbert
diminish
this
hello
bill
he
called
adding
with
a
sort
of
timid
bravado
don
t
you
let
em
bluff
you
not
for
a
minute
yes
and
it
was
probably
all
that
wretched
cousin
egbert
s
fault
in
the
first
place
snapped
almost
tearfully
say
listen
here
now
i
don
t
see
as
how
i
ve
done
anything
wrong
he
feebly
protested
bill
s
human
ain
t
he
answer
me
that
one
sees
it
all
this
from
in
bitter
and
judicial
tones
he
flung
out
his
hands
at
cousin
egbert
in
a
gesture
of
pitiless
scorn
i
dare
say
he
continued
that
poor
ruggles
was
merely
a
tool
in
his
hands
weak
possibly
but
not
may
i
inquire
i
made
bold
to
begin
but
effie
shut
me
off
brandishing
the
newspaper
before
me
read
it
she
commanded
in
hoarse
tragic
tones
there
she
added
pointing
at
monstrous
black
headlines
on
the
page
as
i
weakly
took
it
from
her
and
then
i
saw
there
before
them
divining
now
the
enormity
of
what
had
come
to
pass
i
controlled
myself
to
master
the
following
screed
red
gap
s
distinguished
visitor
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
of
london
and
paris
late
of
the
british
army
and
man
of
the
world
is
in
our
midst
for
an
indefinite
stay
being
at
present
the
honoured
house
guest
of
senator
and
james
knox
floud
who
returned
from
foreign
parts
on
the
flyer
yesterday
afternoon
colonel
ruggles
has
long
been
intimately
associated
with
the
family
of
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
and
especially
with
his
lordship
s
brother
the
honourable
george
augustus
with
whom
he
has
recently
been
sojourning
in
la
belle
france
in
a
brief
interview
which
the
colonel
genially
accorded
ye
scribe
he
expressed
himself
as
delighted
with
our
thriving
little
city
it
s
somewhat
a
town
if
i
ve
caught
your
american
slang
he
said
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
you
have
the
garden
spot
of
the
west
if
not
of
the
civilized
world
and
your
people
display
a
charm
that
must
be
i
dare
say
typically
american
altogether
i
am
enchanted
with
the
wonders
i
have
beheld
since
landing
at
your
new
york
particularly
with
the
habit
your
best
people
have
of
roughing
it
in
camps
like
that
of
among
the
mountains
of
new
york
where
i
was
most
pleasantly
entertained
by
himself
and
his
delightful
wife
the
length
of
my
stay
among
you
is
uncertain
though
i
have
been
pressed
by
the
flouds
with
whom
i
am
stopping
and
by
the
to
prolong
it
indefinitely
and
in
fact
to
identify
myself
to
an
extent
with
your
social
the
colonel
is
a
man
of
distinguished
appearance
with
the
seasoned
bearing
of
an
old
campaigner
and
though
at
moments
he
displays
that
cool
reserve
so
typical
of
the
english
gentleman
evidence
was
not
lacking
last
evening
that
he
can
unbend
on
occasion
at
the
lawn
f√™te
held
in
the
spacious
grounds
of
judge
ballard
where
a
myriad
japanese
lanterns
made
the
scene
a
veritable
fairyland
he
was
quite
the
most
notable
present
and
gayly
tripped
the
light
fantastic
toe
with
the
√©lite
of
red
gap
s
smart
set
there
assembled
from
his
cordial
manner
of
entering
into
the
spirit
of
the
affair
we
predict
that
colonel
ruggles
will
be
a
decided
acquisition
to
our
social
life
and
we
understand
that
a
series
of
recherch√©
entertainments
in
his
honour
has
already
been
planned
by
county
judge
ballard
who
took
the
distinguished
guest
under
her
wing
the
moment
he
appeared
last
evening
welcome
to
our
city
colonel
and
may
the
warm
hearts
of
red
gap
cause
you
to
forget
that
european
world
of
fashion
of
which
you
have
long
been
so
distinguished
an
ornament
in
a
sickening
silence
i
finished
the
thing
as
the
absurd
sheet
fell
from
my
nerveless
fingers
effie
cried
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
do
you
realize
the
dreadful
thing
you
ve
done
to
us
speechless
i
was
with
humiliation
unequal
even
to
protesting
that
i
had
said
nothing
of
the
sort
to
the
i
mean
to
say
he
had
wretchedly
twisted
my
harmless
words
have
you
nothing
to
say
for
yourself
demanded
also
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
i
glanced
at
her
husband
he
too
was
pale
with
anger
and
trembling
so
that
i
fancied
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
the
wretched
man
declared
effie
addressing
them
all
simply
can
t
realize
how
disgraceful
it
is
oh
we
shall
never
be
able
to
live
it
down
imagine
those
flippant
spokane
sheets
dressing
up
the
thing
hissed
speaking
for
the
first
time
imagine
their
blackguardly
humour
and
that
awful
cousin
egbert
broke
in
effie
pointing
a
desperate
finger
toward
him
think
of
the
he
ll
become
why
he
ll
simply
never
be
able
to
hold
up
his
head
say
you
listen
here
exclaimed
cousin
egbert
with
sudden
heat
never
you
mind
about
my
head
i
always
been
able
to
hold
up
my
head
any
time
i
felt
like
and
again
to
me
he
threw
out
don
t
you
let
em
bluff
you
bill
i
gave
him
a
notice
for
the
paper
explained
effie
plaintively
i
d
written
it
all
nicely
out
to
save
them
time
in
the
office
and
that
would
have
prevented
this
disgrace
but
he
never
gave
it
i
clean
forgot
it
declared
the
offender
what
with
one
thing
and
another
and
gassing
back
and
forth
with
some
o
the
boys
it
kind
of
went
out
o
my
meeting
our
best
people
actually
dancing
with
them
murmured
in
a
voice
vibrant
with
horror
my
dear
i
truly
am
so
sorry
for
you
people
entertained
him
delightfully
at
your
camp
murmured
effie
quickly
in
her
turn
with
a
gesture
toward
the
journal
oh
we
re
both
in
it
i
know
i
know
it
s
appalling
we
ll
never
be
able
to
live
it
down
said
effie
we
shall
have
to
go
away
can
t
you
imagine
what
jen
ballard
will
say
when
she
learns
the
truth
asked
the
other
bitterly
say
we
did
it
on
purpose
to
humiliate
her
and
just
as
all
our
little
scraps
were
being
smoothed
out
so
we
could
get
together
and
put
that
bohemian
set
in
its
place
oh
it
s
so
dreadful
on
the
verge
of
tears
she
seemed
and
scarcely
a
word
mentioned
of
our
own
return
when
i
d
taken
such
pains
with
the
notice
listen
here
said
cousin
egbert
brightly
i
ll
take
the
piece
down
now
and
he
can
print
it
in
his
paper
for
you
you
can
t
understand
she
replied
impatiently
i
casually
mentioned
our
having
brought
an
english
manservant
print
that
now
and
insult
all
our
best
people
who
received
him
pathetic
how
little
the
poor
chap
understands
sighed
no
sense
at
all
of
our
plight
naturally
naturally
a
series
of
entertainments
being
planned
in
his
honour
quavered
the
most
notable
present
echoed
effie
viciously
again
and
again
i
had
essayed
to
protest
my
innocence
only
to
provoke
renewed
outbursts
i
could
but
stand
there
with
what
dignity
i
retained
and
let
them
savage
me
cousin
egbert
now
spoke
again
shucks
what
s
all
the
fuss
just
because
i
took
bill
out
and
give
him
a
good
time
didn
t
you
say
yourself
in
that
there
very
piece
that
he
d
impart
to
coming
functions
an
air
of
smartiness
like
they
have
all
over
europe
didn
t
you
write
them
very
words
and
ain
t
he
already
done
it
the
very
first
night
he
gets
here
right
at
that
there
where
i
took
him
what
for
do
you
jump
on
me
then
i
took
him
and
he
done
it
he
done
it
good
bill
s
a
born
mixer
why
he
had
all
them
north
side
society
dames
stung
the
minute
i
flashed
him
after
him
quicker
than
hell
could
scorch
a
feather
run
out
from
under
their
hats
to
get
introduced
to
him
and
now
you
all
turn
on
me
like
a
passel
of
starved
he
finished
with
a
note
of
genuine
irritation
i
had
never
heard
in
his
voice
the
poor
creature
s
demented
remarked
pityingly
always
been
that
way
said
effie
hopelessly
contented
himself
with
a
mere
clicking
sound
of
commiseration
all
right
then
if
you
re
so
smart
continued
cousin
egbert
just
the
same
bill
here
is
the
most
popular
thing
in
the
whole
kulanche
valley
this
minute
so
all
i
got
to
say
is
if
you
want
to
play
this
here
society
game
you
better
stick
close
by
him
first
thing
you
know
some
o
them
other
dames
ll
have
him
won
from
you
that
mis
ballard
s
going
to
invite
him
to
supper
or
dinner
or
some
other
doings
right
away
i
heard
her
say
to
my
amazement
a
curious
and
prolonged
silence
greeted
this
amazing
tirade
the
three
at
length
were
regarding
each
other
almost
furtively
began
to
pace
the
floor
in
deep
thought
after
all
no
one
knows
except
ourselves
he
said
in
curiously
hushed
tones
at
last
of
course
it
s
one
way
out
of
a
dreadful
mess
observed
his
wife
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
of
the
british
army
said
effie
in
a
peculiar
tone
as
if
she
were
trying
over
a
song
it
may
indeed
be
the
best
way
out
of
an
impossible
situation
continued
musingly
otherwise
we
face
a
social
upheaval
that
might
leave
us
demoralized
for
years
say
nothing
of
making
us
a
laughingstock
with
the
rabble
in
fact
i
see
nothing
else
to
be
cousin
egbert
would
be
sure
to
spoil
it
all
again
objected
effie
glaring
at
him
no
danger
returned
the
other
with
his
superior
smile
being
quite
unable
to
realize
what
has
happened
he
will
be
equally
unable
to
realize
what
is
going
to
happen
we
may
speak
before
him
as
before
a
babe
in
arms
the
amenities
of
the
situation
are
forever
beyond
i
guess
i
always
been
able
to
hold
up
my
head
when
i
felt
like
it
put
in
cousin
egbert
now
again
both
sullen
and
puzzled
once
more
he
threw
out
his
encouragement
to
me
don
t
let
em
run
any
bluffs
bill
they
can
t
touch
you
and
they
know
touch
him
murmured
with
an
able
sneer
my
dear
what
a
trial
he
must
have
been
to
you
i
never
knew
he
s
as
bad
as
the
mater
and
such
hopes
i
had
of
him
in
paris
replied
effie
when
he
was
taking
up
art
and
dressing
for
dinner
and
everything
i
can
be
pushed
just
so
far
muttered
the
offender
darkly
there
was
now
a
ring
at
the
door
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
answering
and
received
two
notes
from
a
messenger
one
bore
the
address
of
floud
and
the
other
was
quite
astonishingly
to
myself
the
name
preceded
by
that
s
jen
ballard
s
stationery
cried
trust
her
not
to
lose
one
second
in
getting
busy
but
he
mustn
t
answer
the
door
that
way
exclaimed
her
husband
as
i
handed
effie
her
note
they
were
indeed
both
from
my
acquaintance
of
the
night
before
receiving
permission
to
read
my
own
i
found
it
to
be
a
dinner
invitation
for
the
following
friday
effie
looked
up
from
hers
it
s
all
too
true
she
announced
grimly
we
re
asked
to
dinner
and
she
earnestly
hopes
dear
colonel
ruggles
will
have
made
no
other
engagement
she
also
says
hasn
t
he
the
darlingest
english
accent
oh
isn
t
it
a
mess
you
see
how
right
i
am
said
i
guess
we
ve
got
to
go
through
with
it
conceded
effie
the
pushing
thing
that
ballard
woman
is
observed
her
friend
ruggles
exclaimed
addressing
me
with
sudden
decision
yes
listen
carefully
i
m
quite
serious
in
future
you
will
try
to
address
me
as
if
i
were
your
equal
ah
rather
you
will
try
to
address
me
as
if
you
were
equal
i
dare
say
it
will
come
to
you
easily
after
a
bit
of
practice
your
employers
will
wish
you
to
address
them
in
the
same
manner
you
will
cultivate
toward
us
a
manner
of
easy
friendliness
remember
i
m
entirely
serious
quite
as
if
you
were
one
of
us
you
must
try
to
be
in
short
the
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
that
wretched
has
foisted
upon
these
innocent
people
we
shall
thus
avert
a
most
humiliating
the
thing
fair
staggered
me
i
fell
weakly
into
the
chair
by
which
i
had
stood
for
the
first
time
in
a
not
uneventful
career
feeling
that
my
had
been
overtaxed
quite
right
he
went
on
be
seated
as
one
of
us
and
he
amazingly
proffered
me
his
cigarette
case
do
take
one
old
chap
he
insisted
as
i
weakly
waved
it
away
and
against
my
will
i
did
so
dare
say
you
ll
fancy
them
a
cigarette
especially
prescribed
for
he
now
held
a
match
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
smoke
never
have
i
been
in
less
humour
for
it
there
not
so
hard
is
it
you
see
we
re
getting
on
ain
t
i
always
said
bill
was
a
good
mixer
called
cousin
egbert
but
his
gaucherie
was
pointedly
ignored
now
continued
suppose
you
tell
us
in
a
chatty
friendly
way
just
what
you
think
about
this
regrettable
all
sat
forward
interestedly
but
i
met
what
i
supposed
were
your
villagers
i
said
your
small
tradesmen
your
artisans
clerks
and
the
like
i
d
no
idea
in
the
world
they
were
your
county
families
seemed
quite
a
bit
too
jolly
for
that
and
your
preposterous
quite
he
quizzed
me
rather
i
admit
but
he
made
it
vastly
different
your
pressmen
are
remarkable
that
thing
is
a
fair
but
surely
put
in
effie
you
could
see
that
judge
ballard
must
be
one
of
our
best
i
saw
she
was
a
goodish
sort
i
explained
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
one
would
meet
her
in
your
best
houses
and
when
she
spoke
of
entertaining
me
i
fancied
i
might
stroll
by
her
cottage
some
fair
day
and
be
asked
in
to
a
slice
from
one
of
her
own
loaves
and
a
dish
of
tea
there
was
that
about
mercy
exclaimed
both
ladies
adding
a
bit
maliciously
i
thought
oh
don
t
you
awfully
wish
she
could
hear
him
say
it
just
that
way
as
to
the
title
i
continued
mr
egbert
has
from
the
first
had
a
curious
american
tendency
to
present
me
to
his
many
friends
as
i
am
sure
he
means
as
little
by
it
as
when
he
calls
me
bill
which
i
have
often
reminded
him
is
not
a
name
of
oh
we
understand
the
poor
chap
is
a
social
incompetent
said
with
a
despairing
shrug
say
look
here
suddenly
exclaimed
cousin
egbert
a
new
heat
in
his
tone
what
i
call
bill
ain
t
a
marker
to
what
i
call
you
when
i
really
get
going
you
ought
to
hear
me
some
day
when
i
m
feeling
right
really
exclaimed
the
other
with
elaborate
sarcasm
yes
sir
surest
thing
you
know
i
could
call
you
a
lot
of
good
things
right
now
if
so
many
ladies
wasn
t
around
you
don
t
think
i
d
be
afraid
do
you
why
bill
there
had
you
licked
with
one
but
really
really
protested
the
other
with
a
helpless
shrug
to
the
ladies
who
were
gasping
with
dismay
you
ruffian
cried
his
wife
egbert
floud
said
effie
fiercely
you
will
apologize
to
charles
before
you
leave
this
room
the
idea
of
forgetting
yourself
that
way
apologize
at
once
oh
very
well
he
grumbled
i
apologize
like
i
m
made
but
he
added
quickly
with
even
more
irritation
only
don
t
you
get
the
idea
it
s
because
i
m
afraid
of
tush
tush
said
no
sir
i
apologize
but
it
ain
t
for
one
minute
because
i
m
afraid
of
your
bare
apology
is
ample
i
m
bound
to
accept
it
replied
the
other
a
bit
uneasily
i
thought
come
right
down
to
it
continued
cousin
egbert
i
ain
t
afraid
of
hardly
any
person
i
can
be
pushed
just
so
here
he
looked
significantly
at
effie
after
all
i
ve
tried
to
do
for
him
she
moaned
i
thought
he
had
something
in
darn
it
all
i
like
to
be
friendly
with
my
friends
he
bluntly
persisted
i
call
a
man
anything
that
suits
me
and
i
ain
t
ever
apologized
yet
because
i
was
afraid
i
want
all
parties
here
to
get
say
no
more
please
it
s
quite
understood
said
hastily
the
other
subsided
into
low
mutterings
i
trust
you
fully
understand
the
situation
ruggles
colonel
ruggles
he
continued
to
me
it
s
preposterous
but
plain
as
a
i
answered
i
can
only
regret
it
as
keenly
as
any
person
should
it
s
not
at
all
what
i
ve
been
accustomed
very
well
then
i
suggest
that
you
accompany
me
for
a
drive
this
afternoon
i
ll
call
for
you
with
the
trap
say
at
perhaps
suggested
his
wife
it
might
be
as
well
if
colonel
ruggles
were
to
come
to
us
as
a
she
was
regarding
me
with
a
gaze
that
was
frankly
speculative
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
retorted
effie
crisply
having
been
announced
as
our
house
guest
never
do
in
the
world
for
him
to
go
to
you
so
soon
we
must
be
careful
in
this
later
perhaps
my
briefly
the
ladies
measured
each
other
with
a
glance
could
it
be
i
asked
myself
that
they
were
sparring
for
the
possession
of
me
naturally
he
will
be
asked
about
everywhere
and
there
ll
be
loads
of
entertaining
to
do
in
of
course
returned
effie
and
i
d
never
think
of
putting
it
off
on
to
you
dear
when
we
re
wholly
to
blame
for
the
awful
that
s
so
thoughtful
of
you
dear
replied
her
friend
coldly
at
three
then
said
as
we
arose
i
shall
be
delighted
i
murmured
i
bet
you
won
t
said
cousin
egbert
sourly
he
wants
to
show
you
this
i
could
see
was
ignored
as
a
sheer
indecency
we
shall
have
to
get
a
reception
in
quick
said
effie
her
eyes
narrowed
in
calculation
i
don
t
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
remarked
cousin
egbert
again
as
if
to
himself
tearing
me
to
pieces
like
a
passel
of
wolves
the
left
hastily
not
deigning
him
a
glance
and
to
do
the
poor
soul
justice
i
believe
he
did
not
at
all
know
what
the
fuss
had
been
about
the
niceties
of
the
situation
were
beyond
him
dear
old
sort
though
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
i
knew
then
i
was
never
again
to
be
harsh
with
him
let
him
dress
as
he
would
say
he
asked
the
moment
we
were
alone
you
remember
that
thing
you
called
him
back
there
that
night
blighted
little
mug
was
it
it
s
best
forgotten
sir
i
said
well
sir
some
way
it
sounded
just
the
thing
to
call
him
it
sounded
bully
what
does
it
mean
so
far
was
his
darkened
mind
from
comprehending
that
i
in
a
foreign
land
among
a
weird
people
must
now
have
a
go
at
being
a
gentleman
and
that
if
i
fluffed
my
catch
we
should
all
be
gossipped
to
rags
alone
in
my
room
i
made
a
hasty
inventory
of
my
wardrobe
thanks
to
the
circumstance
that
the
honourable
george
despite
my
warning
had
for
several
years
refused
to
bant
it
was
rather
well
stocked
the
evening
clothes
were
irreproachable
so
were
the
frock
coat
and
a
morning
suit
of
waistcoats
there
were
a
number
showing
but
slight
wear
the
three
of
tweed
though
slightly
demoded
would
still
be
vogue
in
this
remote
spot
for
sticks
gloves
cravats
and
i
saw
that
i
should
be
compelled
to
levy
on
the
store
i
had
laid
in
for
cousin
egbert
and
i
happily
discovered
that
his
set
me
quite
effectively
also
in
a
casket
of
trifles
that
had
knocked
about
in
my
box
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
the
monocle
that
the
honourable
george
had
discarded
some
years
before
on
the
ground
that
it
was
bally
i
screwed
the
glass
into
my
eye
the
effect
was
tremendous
rather
a
lark
i
might
have
thought
it
but
for
the
false
military
title
that
was
rank
deception
and
i
have
always
regarded
any
sort
of
wrongdoing
as
detestable
perhaps
if
he
had
introduced
me
as
a
mere
subaltern
in
a
line
regiment
but
i
was
powerless
for
the
afternoon
s
drive
i
chose
the
smartest
of
the
a
carlsbad
hat
which
cousin
egbert
had
bitterly
resented
for
himself
and
for
a
light
weight
chesterfield
with
velvet
collar
which
although
the
cut
studiously
avoids
a
fitted
effect
is
yet
a
garment
that
intrigues
the
eye
when
carried
with
any
distinction
so
many
are
but
mere
wrappings
i
had
too
gloves
of
a
delicately
contrasting
tint
altogether
i
felt
i
had
turned
myself
out
well
and
this
i
found
to
be
the
verdict
of
effie
who
engaged
me
in
the
hall
to
say
that
i
was
to
have
anything
in
the
way
of
equipment
i
liked
to
ask
for
also
arriving
now
in
a
smart
trap
to
which
he
drove
two
cobs
tandem
was
at
once
impressed
and
made
me
compliments
upon
my
tenue
i
was
aware
that
i
appeared
not
badly
beside
him
i
mean
to
say
i
felt
that
i
was
vogue
in
the
finest
sense
of
the
word
effie
waved
us
a
farewell
from
the
doorway
and
i
was
conscious
that
from
several
houses
on
either
side
of
the
avenue
we
attracted
more
than
a
bit
of
attention
there
were
doors
opened
blinds
pushed
aside
faces
that
sort
of
thing
at
a
leisurely
pace
we
progressed
through
the
main
thoroughfares
that
we
created
a
sensation
especially
along
the
commercial
streets
where
my
host
halted
at
shops
to
order
goods
can
not
be
denied
furore
is
perhaps
the
word
i
mean
to
say
almost
quite
every
one
stared
rather
more
like
a
parade
it
was
than
i
could
have
wished
but
i
was
again
resolved
to
be
a
dead
sportsman
among
those
who
saluted
us
from
time
to
time
were
several
of
the
lesser
townsmen
to
whom
cousin
egbert
had
presented
me
the
evening
before
and
i
now
perceived
that
most
of
these
were
truly
persons
i
must
not
know
in
my
present
station
hodmen
grooms
that
sort
in
responding
to
the
often
florid
salutations
of
such
i
instilled
into
my
barely
perceptible
nod
a
certain
frigidity
that
i
trusted
might
be
informing
i
mean
to
say
having
now
a
position
to
keep
up
it
would
never
do
at
all
to
chatter
and
pal
about
loosely
as
cousin
egbert
did
when
we
had
done
a
fairish
number
of
streets
both
of
shops
and
villas
we
drove
out
a
winding
roadway
along
a
tarn
to
the
country
club
the
house
was
an
unpretentious
structure
of
native
wood
fronting
a
couple
of
tennis
courts
and
a
golf
links
but
although
it
was
not
a
soul
was
present
having
unlocked
the
door
my
host
suggested
refreshment
and
i
consented
to
partake
of
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
but
these
it
seemed
were
not
to
be
had
so
over
pegs
of
ginger
ale
found
in
an
we
sat
for
a
time
and
chatted
you
will
find
us
crude
ruggles
as
i
warned
you
my
host
observed
take
this
deserted
clubhouse
at
this
hour
it
tells
the
story
take
again
the
matter
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
so
simple
yet
no
one
ever
thinks
of
them
and
what
you
mean
by
a
biscuit
is
in
this
wretched
hole
spoken
of
as
a
i
thanked
him
for
the
item
resolving
to
add
it
to
my
list
of
curious
americanisms
already
i
had
begun
a
narrative
of
my
adventures
in
this
wild
land
a
thing
i
had
tentatively
entitled
alone
in
north
though
we
have
people
in
abundance
of
ample
means
he
went
on
you
will
regret
to
know
that
we
have
not
achieved
a
leisured
class
barely
once
in
a
fortnight
will
you
see
this
club
patronized
after
all
the
pains
i
took
in
its
organization
they
simply
haven
t
evolved
to
the
idea
yet
sometimes
i
have
moments
in
which
i
despair
of
their
ever
doing
as
usual
he
grew
depressed
when
speaking
of
social
red
gap
so
that
we
did
not
tarry
long
in
the
silent
place
that
should
have
been
quite
alive
with
people
smartly
having
their
tea
as
we
drove
back
he
touched
briefly
and
with
all
delicacy
on
our
changed
relations
what
made
me
only
too
glad
to
consent
to
it
he
said
is
the
sodden
depravity
of
that
floud
chap
really
he
s
a
menace
to
the
community
i
saw
from
the
degenerate
leer
on
his
face
this
morning
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
keep
silent
about
that
little
affair
of
ours
back
there
mark
my
words
he
ll
talk
and
fancy
how
embarrassing
had
you
continued
in
the
office
for
which
you
were
engaged
fancy
it
being
known
i
had
been
assaulted
by
a
you
see
what
i
mean
but
now
let
him
talk
his
vilest
what
is
it
a
mere
disagreement
between
two
gentlemen
generous
chaps
followed
by
mutual
apologies
a
mere
nothing
i
was
conscious
of
more
than
a
little
irritation
at
his
manner
of
speaking
of
cousin
egbert
but
this
in
my
new
character
i
could
hardly
betray
when
he
set
me
down
at
the
floud
house
thanks
for
the
i
said
then
with
an
easy
wave
of
the
hand
and
in
firm
tones
good
day
jackson
see
you
again
old
chap
i
had
nerved
myself
to
it
as
to
an
icy
tub
and
was
rewarded
by
a
glow
such
as
had
suffused
me
that
morning
in
paris
after
the
shameful
proceedings
with
cousin
egbert
and
the
indian
tuttle
i
mean
to
say
i
felt
again
that
wonderful
thrill
of
equality
quite
as
if
my
superiors
were
not
all
about
me
inside
the
house
effie
addressed
the
last
of
a
heap
of
invitations
for
an
early
reception
to
meet
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
they
read
chapter
nine
of
the
following
fortnight
i
find
it
difficult
to
write
coherently
i
found
myself
in
a
steady
whirl
of
receptions
luncheons
dinners
teas
and
assemblies
of
rather
a
pretentious
character
at
the
greater
number
of
which
i
was
obliged
to
appear
as
the
guest
of
honour
it
began
with
the
reception
of
floud
at
which
i
may
be
said
to
have
made
my
first
formal
bow
to
the
smarter
element
of
red
gap
followed
by
the
dinner
of
the
ballard
with
whom
i
had
formed
acquaintance
on
that
first
memorable
evening
i
was
during
this
time
like
a
babe
at
blind
play
with
a
set
of
chess
men
not
knowing
king
from
pawn
nor
one
rule
of
the
game
senator
floud
who
was
but
a
member
of
their
provincial
assembly
i
discovered
sought
an
early
opportunity
to
felicitate
me
on
my
changed
estate
though
he
seemed
not
a
little
amused
by
it
good
work
he
said
you
know
i
was
afraid
our
having
an
english
valet
would
put
me
in
bad
with
the
voters
this
fall
they
re
already
saying
i
wear
silk
stockings
since
i
ve
been
abroad
my
wife
did
buy
me
six
pair
but
i
ve
never
worn
any
shows
how
people
talk
though
and
even
now
they
ll
probably
say
i
m
making
up
to
the
british
army
but
it
s
better
than
having
a
valet
in
the
house
the
plain
people
would
never
stand
my
having
a
valet
and
i
know
i
thought
this
most
remarkable
that
his
constituency
should
resent
his
having
proper
house
service
american
politics
were
then
more
debased
than
even
we
of
england
had
dreamed
good
work
he
said
again
and
say
take
out
your
papers
become
one
of
us
be
a
citizen
nothing
better
than
an
american
citizen
on
god
s
green
earth
read
the
declaration
of
independence
here
from
a
bookcase
at
his
hand
he
reached
me
a
volume
read
and
reflect
my
man
become
a
citizen
of
a
country
where
true
worth
has
always
its
chance
and
one
may
hope
to
climb
to
any
heights
quite
like
an
advertisement
he
talked
but
i
read
their
declaration
finding
it
snarky
in
the
extreme
and
with
no
end
of
silly
rot
about
equality
in
no
way
at
all
did
it
solve
the
problems
by
which
i
had
been
so
suddenly
confronted
social
lines
in
the
town
seemed
to
have
been
drawn
by
no
rule
whatever
there
were
actually
tradesmen
who
seemed
to
matter
enormously
on
the
other
hand
there
were
those
of
undoubted
qualifications
like
pettengill
for
example
and
cousin
egbert
who
deliberately
chose
not
to
matter
and
mingled
as
freely
with
the
bohemian
set
as
they
did
with
the
county
families
thus
one
could
never
be
quite
certain
whom
one
was
meeting
there
was
the
tuttle
person
i
had
learned
from
effie
in
paris
that
he
was
an
indian
accounting
for
much
that
was
startling
in
his
behaviour
there
yet
despite
his
being
an
aborigine
i
now
learned
that
his
was
one
of
the
county
families
and
he
and
his
white
american
wife
were
guests
at
that
first
dinner
throughout
the
meal
both
cousin
egbert
and
he
winked
atrociously
at
me
whenever
they
could
catch
my
eye
there
was
again
an
english
person
calling
himself
hobbs
a
baker
to
whom
cousin
egbert
presented
me
full
of
delight
at
the
idea
that
as
compatriots
we
were
bound
to
be
congenial
yet
it
needed
only
a
glance
and
a
moment
s
listening
to
the
fellow
s
execrable
cockney
dialect
to
perceive
that
he
was
distinctly
and
i
was
immensely
relieved
upon
inquiry
to
learn
that
he
affiliated
only
with
the
bohemian
set
i
felt
a
marked
antagonism
between
us
at
that
first
meeting
the
fellow
eyed
me
with
frank
suspicion
and
displayed
a
taste
for
low
chaffing
which
i
felt
bound
to
rebuke
he
it
was
i
may
now
disclose
who
later
began
a
fashion
of
referring
to
me
as
lord
algy
which
i
found
in
the
worst
possible
taste
sets
himself
up
for
a
gentleman
does
he
he
ain
t
no
more
a
gentleman
than
wot
i
be
this
speech
of
his
reported
to
me
will
show
how
impossible
the
creature
was
he
was
simply
a
person
one
does
not
know
and
i
was
not
long
in
letting
him
see
it
and
there
was
the
woman
who
was
to
play
so
active
a
part
in
my
later
history
of
whom
it
will
be
well
to
speak
at
once
i
had
remarked
her
on
the
main
street
before
i
knew
her
identity
i
am
bound
to
say
she
stood
out
from
the
other
women
of
red
gap
by
reason
of
a
certain
dash
not
to
say
beauty
rather
above
medium
height
and
of
pleasingly
full
figure
her
face
was
piquantly
alert
with
eyes
of
a
peculiar
green
a
small
nose
the
least
bit
raised
a
lifted
chin
and
an
abundance
of
yellowish
hair
but
it
was
the
expertness
of
her
gowning
that
really
held
my
attention
at
that
first
view
and
the
fact
that
she
knew
what
to
put
on
her
head
for
the
most
part
the
ladies
i
had
met
were
well
enough
gotten
up
yet
looked
curiously
all
wrong
lacking
a
genius
for
harmony
of
detail
this
person
i
repeat
displayed
a
taste
that
was
faultless
a
knowledge
of
the
peculiar
needs
of
her
face
and
figure
that
was
unimpeachable
rather
with
regret
it
was
i
found
her
to
be
a
kenner
the
leader
of
the
bohemian
set
and
then
came
the
further
items
that
marked
her
as
one
that
could
not
be
taken
up
perhaps
a
summary
of
these
may
be
conveyed
when
i
say
that
she
had
long
been
known
as
klondike
kate
she
had
some
years
before
it
seemed
been
a
dancing
person
in
the
far
alaska
north
and
had
there
married
the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
resorts
in
which
she
disported
herself
a
man
who
had
accumulated
a
very
sizable
fortune
in
his
public
house
and
who
was
shot
to
death
by
one
of
his
patrons
who
had
alleged
unfairness
in
a
game
of
chance
the
widow
had
then
purchased
a
townhouse
in
red
gap
and
had
quickly
gathered
about
her
what
was
known
as
the
bohemian
set
the
county
families
of
course
refusing
to
know
her
after
that
first
brief
study
of
her
i
could
more
easily
account
for
the
undercurrents
of
bitterness
i
had
felt
in
red
gap
society
she
would
be
i
saw
a
dangerous
woman
in
any
situation
where
she
was
opposed
there
was
that
about
her
a
sort
of
daring
disregard
of
the
established
social
order
i
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
the
men
of
the
community
strongly
favoured
her
especially
the
younger
dancing
set
who
were
not
restrained
by
domestic
considerations
small
wonder
then
that
the
women
of
the
old
noblesse
as
i
may
call
them
were
outspokenly
bitter
in
their
comments
upon
her
this
i
discovered
when
i
attended
an
afternoon
meeting
of
the
ladies
onwards
and
upwards
club
which
i
had
been
told
would
be
devoted
to
a
study
of
the
english
lake
poets
and
where
it
having
been
discovered
that
i
read
rather
well
i
had
consented
to
favour
the
assembly
with
some
of
the
more
significant
bits
from
these
bards
the
meeting
i
regret
to
say
after
a
formal
enough
opening
was
diverted
from
its
original
purpose
the
time
being
occupied
in
a
quite
heated
discussion
of
a
dutch
supper
the
klondike
person
had
given
the
evening
before
the
same
having
been
attended
it
seemed
by
the
husbands
of
at
least
three
of
those
present
who
had
gone
incognito
as
it
were
at
no
time
during
the
ensuing
two
hours
was
there
a
moment
that
seemed
opportune
for
the
introduction
of
some
of
our
noblest
verse
and
so
by
often
painful
stages
did
my
education
progress
at
the
country
club
i
played
golf
with
jackson
at
social
affairs
i
appeared
with
the
flouds
i
played
bridge
i
danced
the
more
dignified
dances
and
though
there
was
no
proper
church
in
the
town
only
dissenting
chapels
methodist
presbyterian
and
such
outlandish
persuasions
i
attended
services
each
sabbath
and
more
than
once
had
tea
with
what
at
home
would
have
been
the
vicar
of
the
parish
it
was
now
when
i
had
begun
to
feel
a
bit
at
ease
in
my
queer
foreign
environment
that
broached
his
plan
for
amateur
theatricals
at
the
first
suggestion
of
this
i
was
immensely
taken
with
the
idea
suspecting
that
he
would
perhaps
present
hamlet
a
part
to
which
i
have
devoted
long
and
intelligent
study
and
to
which
i
feel
that
i
could
bring
something
which
has
not
yet
been
imparted
to
it
by
even
the
most
skilled
of
our
professional
actors
but
at
my
suggestion
of
this
informed
me
that
he
had
already
played
hamlet
himself
the
year
before
leaving
nothing
further
to
be
done
in
that
direction
and
he
wished
now
to
attempt
something
more
difficult
something
moreover
that
would
appeal
to
the
little
group
of
thinking
people
about
us
he
would
have
a
little
theatre
of
ideas
as
he
phrased
it
and
he
had
chosen
for
his
first
offering
a
play
entitled
ghosts
by
the
foreign
dramatist
ibsen
i
suspected
at
first
that
this
might
be
a
farce
where
a
supposititious
ghost
brings
about
absurd
predicaments
in
a
country
house
having
seen
something
along
these
lines
but
a
reading
of
the
thing
enlightened
me
as
to
its
character
which
to
put
it
bluntly
is
rather
thick
there
is
a
strain
of
immorality
running
through
it
which
i
believe
can
not
be
too
strongly
condemned
if
the
world
is
to
be
made
better
and
this
is
rendered
the
more
repugnant
to
people
by
the
fact
that
the
participants
are
persons
who
converse
in
quite
commonplace
language
such
as
one
may
hear
any
day
in
the
home
wrongdoing
is
surely
never
so
objectionable
as
when
it
is
indulged
in
by
common
people
and
talked
about
in
ordinary
language
and
the
language
of
this
play
is
not
stage
language
at
all
immorality
such
as
one
gets
in
shakespeare
is
of
so
elevated
a
character
that
one
accepts
it
the
language
having
a
grandeur
incomparably
above
what
any
person
was
ever
capable
of
in
private
life
being
always
elegant
and
unnatural
though
i
felt
this
strongly
i
was
in
no
position
to
urge
my
objections
and
at
length
consented
to
take
a
part
in
the
production
reflecting
that
the
people
depicted
were
really
foreigners
and
the
part
i
would
play
was
that
of
a
clergyman
whose
behaviour
throughout
is
above
reproach
for
himself
jackson
had
chosen
the
part
of
oswald
a
youth
who
goes
quite
dotty
at
the
last
for
reasons
which
are
better
not
talked
about
his
wife
was
to
play
the
part
of
a
who
was
rather
a
baggage
while
judge
ballard
was
to
enact
his
mother
i
may
say
in
passing
i
have
learned
that
the
plays
of
this
foreigner
are
largely
concerned
with
people
who
have
been
queer
at
one
time
or
another
so
that
one
s
parentage
is
often
uncertain
though
they
always
pay
for
it
by
going
off
in
the
head
before
the
final
curtain
i
mean
to
say
there
is
too
much
neighbourhood
scandal
in
them
there
remained
but
one
part
to
fill
that
of
the
father
of
the
an
uncouth
sort
of
quite
who
in
my
opinion
should
never
have
been
allowed
on
the
stage
at
all
since
no
moral
lesson
is
taught
by
him
it
was
in
the
casting
of
this
part
that
jackson
showed
himself
of
a
forgiving
nature
he
offered
it
to
cousin
egbert
saying
he
was
the
true
type
with
his
weak
dissolute
face
and
that
types
were
all
the
rage
in
theatricals
at
first
the
latter
heatedly
declined
the
honour
but
after
being
urged
and
browbeaten
for
three
days
by
effie
he
somewhat
sullenly
consented
being
shown
that
there
were
not
many
lines
for
him
to
learn
from
the
first
i
think
he
was
rendered
quite
miserable
by
the
ordeal
before
him
yet
he
submitted
to
the
rehearsals
with
a
rather
pathetic
desire
to
please
and
for
a
time
all
seemed
well
many
an
hour
found
him
mugging
away
at
the
book
earnestly
striving
to
memorize
the
part
or
as
he
quaintly
expressed
it
that
there
piece
they
want
me
to
but
as
the
day
of
our
performance
drew
near
it
became
evident
to
me
at
least
that
he
was
in
a
desperately
black
state
of
mind
as
best
i
could
i
cheered
him
with
words
of
praise
but
his
eye
met
mine
blankly
at
such
times
and
i
could
see
him
shudder
poignantly
while
waiting
the
moment
of
his
entrance
and
still
all
might
have
been
well
i
fancy
but
for
the
extremely
conscientious
views
of
jackson
in
the
matter
of
our
costuming
and
with
his
lines
fairly
learned
cousin
egbert
on
the
night
of
our
dress
rehearsal
was
called
upon
first
to
don
the
garb
of
the
foreign
carpenter
he
was
to
enact
the
same
involving
shorts
and
gray
woollen
hose
to
his
knees
at
which
he
protested
violently
so
far
as
i
could
gather
his
modesty
was
affronted
by
this
revelation
of
his
lower
legs
being
at
length
persuaded
to
this
sacrifice
he
next
submitted
his
face
to
jackson
who
adjusted
it
to
a
labouring
person
s
beard
and
eyebrows
crimsoning
the
cheeks
and
nose
heavily
with
and
crowning
all
with
an
unkempt
wig
the
result
i
am
bound
to
say
was
artistic
in
the
extreme
no
one
would
have
suspected
the
identity
of
cousin
egbert
and
i
had
hopes
that
he
would
feel
a
new
courage
for
his
part
when
he
beheld
himself
instead
however
after
one
quick
glance
into
the
glass
he
emitted
a
gasp
of
horror
that
was
most
eloquent
and
thereafter
refused
to
be
comforted
holding
himself
aloof
and
glaring
hideously
at
all
who
approached
him
rather
like
a
mad
dog
he
was
half
an
hour
later
when
all
was
ready
for
our
first
act
cousin
egbert
was
not
to
be
found
i
need
not
dwell
upon
the
annoyance
this
occasioned
nor
upon
how
a
substitute
in
the
person
of
our
hall
s
custodian
or
janitor
was
impressed
to
read
the
part
suffice
it
to
tell
briefly
that
cousin
egbert
costumed
and
bedizened
as
he
was
had
fled
not
only
the
theatre
but
the
town
as
well
search
for
him
on
the
morrow
was
unavailing
not
until
the
second
day
did
it
become
known
that
he
had
been
seen
at
daybreak
forty
miles
from
red
gap
goading
a
spent
horse
into
the
wilds
of
the
adjacent
mountains
our
informant
disclosed
that
one
side
of
his
face
was
still
bearded
and
that
he
had
kept
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
at
frequent
intervals
as
if
fearful
of
pursuit
something
of
his
frantic
state
may
also
be
gleaned
from
the
circumstance
that
the
horse
he
rode
was
one
he
had
found
hitched
in
a
side
street
near
the
hall
its
ownership
being
unknown
to
him
for
the
rest
it
may
be
said
that
our
performance
was
given
as
scheduled
announcement
being
made
of
the
sudden
illness
of
egbert
floud
and
his
part
being
read
from
the
book
in
a
rich
and
cultivated
voice
by
the
superintendent
of
the
high
school
our
efforts
were
received
with
respectful
attention
by
a
large
audience
among
whom
i
noted
many
of
the
bohemian
set
and
this
i
took
as
an
especial
tribute
to
our
merits
however
to
whom
i
mentioned
the
circumstance
was
pessimistic
i
fear
said
he
we
have
not
heard
the
last
of
it
i
am
sure
they
came
for
no
good
they
were
quite
orderly
in
their
behaviour
i
suggested
which
is
why
i
suspect
them
that
kenner
woman
hobbs
the
baker
the
others
of
their
set
they
re
not
thinking
people
i
dare
say
they
never
consider
social
problems
seriously
and
you
may
have
noticed
that
they
announce
an
amateur
minstrel
performance
for
a
week
hence
i
m
quite
convinced
that
they
mean
to
be
vulgar
to
the
last
extreme
there
has
been
so
much
talk
of
the
behaviour
of
the
wretched
floud
a
fellow
who
really
has
no
place
in
our
modern
civilization
he
should
be
compelled
to
remain
on
his
and
indeed
these
suspicions
proved
to
be
only
too
well
founded
that
which
followed
was
so
atrociously
personal
that
in
any
country
but
america
we
could
have
had
an
action
against
them
as
so
bitterly
said
when
all
was
over
our
boasted
liberty
has
degenerated
into
it
is
best
told
in
a
few
words
this
affair
of
the
minstrel
performance
which
i
understood
was
to
be
an
entertainment
wherein
the
participants
darkened
themselves
to
resemble
blackamoors
naturally
i
did
not
attend
it
being
agreed
that
the
best
people
should
signify
their
disapproval
by
staying
away
but
the
disgraceful
affair
was
recounted
to
me
in
all
its
details
by
more
than
one
of
the
large
audience
that
assembled
in
the
grand
first
part
there
seemed
to
have
been
little
that
was
flagrantly
insulting
to
us
although
in
their
exchange
of
conundrums
which
is
a
peculiar
feature
of
this
form
of
entertainment
certain
names
were
bandied
about
with
a
freedom
that
boded
no
good
it
was
in
the
that
the
poltroons
gave
free
play
to
their
vilest
fancies
our
piece
having
been
announced
as
ghosts
a
drama
for
thinking
people
this
part
was
entitled
on
their
programme
gloats
a
dram
for
drinking
people
a
transposition
that
should
perhaps
suffice
to
show
the
dreadful
lengths
to
which
they
went
yet
i
feel
that
the
thing
should
be
set
down
in
full
the
stage
was
set
as
our
own
had
been
but
it
would
scarce
be
credited
that
the
kenner
woman
in
male
attire
had
made
herself
up
in
a
curiously
accurate
resemblance
to
as
he
had
rendered
the
part
of
oswald
copying
not
alone
his
wig
moustache
and
fashion
of
speech
but
appearing
in
a
golfing
suit
which
was
recognized
by
those
present
as
actually
belonging
to
him
nor
was
this
the
worst
for
the
fellow
hobbs
had
copied
my
own
dress
and
and
persisted
in
speaking
in
an
exaggerated
manner
alleged
to
resemble
mine
this
of
course
was
the
most
shocking
bad
taste
and
while
it
was
quite
to
have
been
expected
of
hobbs
i
was
indeed
rather
surprised
that
the
entire
assembly
did
not
leave
the
auditorium
in
disgust
the
moment
they
perceived
his
base
intention
but
it
was
cousin
egbert
whom
they
had
chosen
to
rag
most
unmercifully
and
they
were
not
long
in
displaying
their
clumsy
attempts
at
humour
as
the
curtain
went
up
they
were
searching
for
him
affecting
to
be
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
their
audience
and
declaring
that
the
play
couldn
t
go
on
without
him
have
you
tried
all
the
saloons
asked
one
to
which
another
responded
yes
and
he
s
been
in
all
of
them
but
now
he
has
fled
the
sheriff
has
put
bloodhounds
on
his
trail
and
promises
to
have
him
here
dead
or
then
while
we
are
waiting
declared
the
character
supposed
to
represent
myself
i
will
tell
you
a
wheeze
whereupon
both
the
female
characters
fell
to
their
knees
shrieking
not
that
my
god
not
that
while
oswald
sneered
viciously
and
muttered
serves
me
right
for
leaving
to
show
the
infamy
of
the
thing
i
must
here
explain
that
at
several
social
gatherings
in
an
effort
which
i
still
believe
was
praiseworthy
i
had
told
an
excellent
wheeze
which
runs
have
you
heard
the
story
of
the
three
holes
in
the
ground
i
mean
to
say
i
would
ask
this
in
an
interested
manner
as
if
i
were
about
to
relate
the
anecdote
and
upon
being
answered
no
i
would
exclaim
with
mock
seriousness
well
well
well
this
had
gone
rippingly
almost
quite
every
time
i
had
favoured
a
company
with
it
hardly
any
one
of
my
hearers
failing
to
get
the
joke
at
a
second
telling
i
mean
to
say
the
three
holes
in
the
ground
being
three
wells
uttered
in
rapid
succession
of
course
if
one
doesn
t
see
it
at
once
or
finds
it
a
bit
subtle
it
s
quite
silly
to
attempt
to
explain
it
because
logically
there
is
no
adequate
explanation
it
is
merely
a
bit
of
nonsense
and
that
s
quite
all
to
it
but
these
boors
now
fell
upon
it
with
their
coarse
humour
the
fellow
hobbs
pretending
to
get
it
all
wrong
by
asking
if
they
had
heard
the
story
about
the
three
wells
and
the
others
replying
no
tell
us
the
hole
thing
which
made
utter
nonsense
of
it
whereupon
they
all
began
to
cry
well
well
well
at
each
other
until
interrupted
by
a
terrific
noise
in
the
wings
which
was
followed
by
the
entrance
of
the
supposed
cousin
egbert
a
part
enacted
by
the
who
had
conveyed
us
from
the
station
the
day
of
our
arrival
dragged
on
he
was
by
the
sheriff
and
two
of
the
town
constables
the
latter
being
armed
with
and
the
sheriff
holding
two
large
dogs
in
leash
the
character
himself
was
heavily
manacled
and
madly
rattled
his
chains
his
face
being
disguised
to
resemble
cousin
egbert
s
after
the
beard
had
been
adjusted
here
he
is
exclaimed
the
supposed
sheriff
the
dogs
ran
him
into
the
third
hole
left
by
the
and
we
lured
him
out
by
making
a
noise
like
sour
during
this
speech
i
am
told
the
character
snarled
continuously
and
tried
to
bite
his
captors
at
this
the
woman
who
had
so
deplorably
unsexed
herself
for
the
character
of
as
he
had
played
oswald
approached
the
prisoner
and
smartly
drew
forth
a
handful
of
his
beard
which
she
stuffed
into
a
pipe
and
proceeded
to
smoke
after
which
they
pretended
that
the
play
went
on
but
no
more
than
a
few
speeches
had
been
uttered
when
the
supposed
cousin
egbert
eluded
his
captors
and
emitting
a
loud
shriek
of
horror
leaped
headlong
through
the
window
at
the
back
of
the
stage
his
disappearance
being
followed
by
the
sounds
of
breaking
glass
as
he
was
supposed
to
fall
to
the
street
below
how
lovely
exclaimed
the
mimic
oswald
perhaps
he
has
broken
both
his
legs
so
he
can
t
run
off
any
more
at
which
the
fellow
hobbs
remarked
in
his
affected
tones
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
with
this
i
learned
aroused
much
laughter
the
idea
being
that
the
remark
had
been
one
which
i
am
supposed
to
make
in
private
life
though
i
dare
say
i
have
never
uttered
anything
remotely
like
it
the
fellow
is
quite
impossible
continued
the
spurious
oswald
with
a
doubtless
rather
clever
imitation
of
s
manner
if
he
is
killed
feed
him
to
the
goldfish
and
let
one
of
the
dogs
read
his
part
we
must
get
along
with
this
play
now
then
ah
why
did
i
ever
leave
boston
where
every
one
is
nice
and
proper
to
which
his
supposed
mother
replied
with
feigned
emotion
it
was
because
of
your
father
my
poor
boy
ah
what
i
had
to
endure
through
those
years
when
he
cursed
and
spoke
disrespectfully
of
our
city
scissors
and
white
aprons
he
would
cry
out
why
is
boston
but
i
bore
it
all
for
your
sake
and
now
you
too
are
smoking
you
will
go
the
same
but
promise
me
mother
returns
oswald
promise
me
if
i
ever
get
dusty
in
the
garret
that
lord
algy
here
will
tell
me
one
of
his
funny
wheezes
and
put
me
out
of
pain
you
could
not
bear
to
hear
me
knocking
boston
as
poor
father
did
and
i
feel
it
coming
already
my
has
bluffed
me
into
admitting
that
red
gap
has
a
right
to
be
on
the
same
map
with
boston
if
it
s
a
big
and
this
was
the
coarsely
wretched
buffoonery
that
refined
people
were
expected
to
sit
through
yet
worse
followed
for
at
their
climax
the
mimic
oswald
having
gone
quite
off
his
head
the
hobbs
person
still
with
the
preposterous
affectation
of
taking
me
off
in
speech
and
manner
was
persuaded
by
the
stricken
mother
to
sing
sing
that
dear
old
plantation
melody
from
london
she
cried
so
that
my
poor
boy
may
know
there
are
worse
things
than
and
all
this
witless
piffle
because
of
a
quite
natural
misunderstanding
of
mine
i
have
before
referred
to
what
i
supposed
was
an
american
plantation
melody
which
i
had
heard
a
black
sing
at
brighton
meaning
one
of
the
english
blacks
who
colour
themselves
for
the
purpose
but
on
reciting
the
lines
at
an
evening
affair
when
the
american
folksongs
were
under
discussion
i
was
told
that
it
could
hardly
have
been
written
by
an
american
at
all
but
doubtless
by
one
of
our
own
composers
who
had
taken
too
little
trouble
with
his
facts
i
mean
to
say
the
song
as
i
had
it
betrayed
misapprehensions
both
of
a
geographical
and
faunal
nature
but
i
am
certain
that
no
one
thought
the
worse
of
me
for
having
been
deceived
and
i
had
supposed
the
thing
forgotten
yet
now
what
did
i
hear
but
that
a
garbled
version
of
this
song
had
been
supposedly
sung
by
myself
the
hobbs
person
meantime
mincing
across
the
stage
and
gesturing
with
a
monocle
which
he
had
somehow
procured
the
words
being
quite
simply
away
down
south
in
michigan
where
i
was
a
slave
so
happy
and
so
gay
twas
there
i
mowed
the
cotton
and
the
cane
i
used
to
hunt
the
elephants
the
tigers
and
giraffes
and
the
alligators
at
the
break
of
day
but
the
blooming
injuns
prowled
about
my
cabin
every
night
so
i
d
take
me
down
my
banjo
and
i
d
play
and
i
d
sing
a
little
song
and
i
d
make
them
dance
with
glee
on
the
banks
of
the
ohio
far
i
mean
to
say
there
was
nothing
to
make
a
dust
about
even
if
the
song
were
not
of
a
true
american
origin
yet
i
was
told
that
the
creature
who
sang
it
received
hearty
applause
and
even
responded
to
an
encore
chapter
ten
i
need
hardly
say
that
this
public
ridicule
left
me
dazed
desperately
i
recalled
our
calm
and
orderly
england
where
such
things
would
not
be
permitted
there
we
are
born
to
our
stations
and
are
not
allowed
to
forget
them
we
matter
from
birth
or
we
do
not
matter
and
that
s
all
to
it
here
there
seemed
to
be
no
stations
to
which
one
was
born
the
effect
was
sheer
anarchy
and
one
might
ridicule
any
one
whomsoever
as
was
actually
said
in
that
snarky
manifesto
drawn
up
by
the
rebel
leaders
at
the
time
our
colonies
revolted
all
men
are
created
free
and
equal
than
which
absurdity
could
go
no
farther
yet
the
lower
middle
classes
seemed
to
behave
quite
as
if
it
were
true
and
now
through
no
fault
of
my
own
another
awkward
circumstance
was
threatening
to
call
further
attention
to
me
which
was
highly
undesirable
at
this
moment
when
the
cheap
hobbs
fellow
had
so
pointedly
singled
me
out
for
his
loathsome
buffoonery
some
ten
days
before
walking
alone
at
the
edge
of
town
one
calm
afternoon
where
i
might
commune
with
nature
of
which
i
have
always
been
fond
i
noted
an
humble
cot
in
the
kitchen
garden
of
which
there
toiled
a
youngish
woman
whom
i
at
once
recognized
as
a
person
who
did
occasional
charring
for
the
flouds
on
the
occasion
of
their
dinners
or
receptions
as
she
had
appeared
to
be
cheerful
and
competent
of
respectful
manners
and
a
quite
marked
intelligence
i
made
nothing
of
stopping
at
her
gate
for
a
moment
s
chat
feeling
a
quite
decided
relief
in
the
thought
that
here
was
one
with
whom
i
need
make
no
pretence
her
social
position
being
sharply
defined
we
spoke
of
the
day
s
heat
which
was
bland
of
the
vegetables
which
she
watered
with
a
lawn
hose
particularly
of
the
tomatoes
of
which
she
was
pardonably
proud
and
of
the
flowering
vine
which
shielded
her
piazza
from
the
sun
and
when
she
presently
and
with
due
courtesy
invited
me
to
enter
i
very
affably
did
so
finding
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
reposeful
and
her
conversation
of
a
character
that
i
could
approve
she
was
dressed
in
a
blue
print
gown
that
suited
her
no
end
the
sleeves
turned
back
over
her
capable
arms
her
brown
hair
was
arranged
with
scrupulous
neatness
her
face
was
pleasantly
flushed
from
her
agricultural
labours
and
her
blue
eyes
flashed
a
friendly
welcome
and
a
pleased
acknowledgment
of
the
compliments
i
made
her
on
the
garden
altogether
she
was
a
person
with
whom
i
at
once
felt
myself
at
ease
and
a
relief
i
confess
it
was
after
the
strain
of
my
high
social
endeavours
after
a
tour
of
the
garden
i
found
myself
in
the
cool
twilight
of
her
little
parlour
where
she
begged
me
to
be
seated
while
she
prepared
me
a
dish
of
tea
which
she
did
in
the
adjoining
kitchen
to
a
cheerful
accompaniment
of
song
quite
with
an
honest
unpretentious
glad
i
was
for
the
moment
to
forget
the
social
rancors
of
the
town
the
affronted
dignities
of
the
north
side
set
and
the
pernicious
activities
of
the
bohemians
for
here
all
was
of
a
simple
humanity
such
as
i
would
have
found
in
a
farmer
s
cottage
at
home
as
i
rested
in
the
parlour
i
could
not
but
approve
its
general
air
of
comfort
and
good
taste
its
clean
flowered
the
pair
of
stuffed
birds
on
the
mantel
the
comfortable
chairs
the
neat
carpet
the
pictures
and
on
a
stand
the
globe
of
goldfish
these
i
noted
with
an
especial
pleasure
for
i
have
always
found
an
intense
satisfaction
in
their
silent
companionship
of
the
pictures
i
noted
particularly
a
drawing
in
in
a
large
gold
frame
of
a
man
whom
i
divined
was
the
deceased
husband
of
my
hostess
there
was
also
a
spirited
reproduction
of
the
stag
at
bay
and
some
charming
coloured
prints
of
villagers
children
and
domestic
animals
in
their
lighter
moments
tea
being
presently
ready
i
genially
insisted
that
it
should
be
served
in
the
kitchen
where
it
had
been
prepared
though
to
this
my
hostess
at
first
stoutly
objected
declaring
that
the
room
was
in
no
suitable
state
but
this
was
a
mere
womanish
hypocrisy
as
the
place
was
spotless
orderly
and
in
fact
quite
meticulous
in
its
neatness
the
tea
was
astonishingly
excellent
so
few
americans
i
had
observed
having
the
faintest
notion
of
the
real
meaning
of
tea
and
i
was
offered
with
it
bread
and
butter
and
a
genuinely
satisfying
compote
of
plums
of
which
my
hostess
confessed
herself
the
fabricator
having
as
she
quaintly
phrased
the
thing
put
it
and
so
over
this
collation
we
chatted
for
quite
all
of
an
hour
the
lady
did
as
i
have
intimated
a
bit
of
charring
a
bit
of
plain
sewing
and
also
derived
no
small
revenue
from
her
vegetables
and
fruit
thus
managing
as
she
owned
the
of
the
premises
to
make
a
decent
living
for
herself
and
child
i
have
said
that
she
was
cheerful
and
competent
and
these
epithets
kept
returning
to
me
as
we
talked
her
husband
she
spoke
of
him
as
poor
judson
had
been
a
carter
and
fellow
decent
enough
i
dare
say
but
hardly
the
man
for
her
i
thought
after
studying
his
portrait
there
was
a
sort
of
foppish
weakness
in
his
face
and
indeed
his
going
seemed
to
have
worked
her
no
hardship
nor
to
have
left
any
incurable
sting
of
loss
three
cups
of
the
almost
perfect
tea
i
drank
as
we
talked
of
her
own
simple
affairs
and
of
the
town
at
large
and
at
length
of
her
child
who
awakened
noisily
from
slumber
in
an
adjacent
room
and
came
voraciously
to
partake
of
food
it
was
a
male
child
of
some
two
and
a
half
years
rather
suggesting
the
generous
of
the
mother
but
in
the
most
shocking
condition
a
thing
i
should
have
spoken
strongly
to
her
about
at
once
had
i
known
her
better
queer
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
woman
of
her
apparently
sound
judgment
should
let
her
offspring
reach
this
terrible
state
without
some
effort
to
alleviate
it
the
poor
thing
to
be
blunt
was
grossly
corpulent
legs
arms
body
and
face
being
wretchedly
fat
and
yet
she
now
fed
it
a
large
slice
of
bread
thickly
spread
with
butter
and
loaded
to
overflowing
with
the
fattening
sweet
banting
of
the
strictest
sort
was
of
course
what
it
needed
i
have
had
but
the
slightest
experience
with
children
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
this
if
its
figure
was
to
be
maintained
its
waistline
was
quite
impossible
and
its
eyes
as
it
owlishly
scrutinized
me
over
its
superfluous
food
showed
from
a
face
already
quite
as
puffy
as
the
honourable
george
s
i
did
indeed
venture
so
far
as
suggesting
that
food
at
untimely
hours
made
for
a
outline
but
to
my
surprise
the
mother
took
this
as
a
tribute
to
the
creature
s
grace
crying
yes
he
wuzzum
wuzzums
a
fatty
ole
sing
with
an
air
of
most
fatuous
pride
and
followed
this
by
announcing
my
name
to
it
with
concerned
precision
ruggums
it
exclaimed
promptly
getting
the
name
all
wrong
and
staring
at
me
with
cold
detachment
then
as
if
it
were
a
game
but
still
stuffing
itself
meanwhile
there
was
a
sort
of
horrid
fascination
in
the
sight
but
i
strove
as
well
as
i
could
to
keep
my
gaze
from
it
and
the
mother
and
i
again
talked
of
matters
at
large
i
come
now
to
speak
of
an
incident
which
made
this
quite
harmless
visit
memorable
and
entailed
unforeseen
consequences
of
an
almost
quite
serious
character
as
we
sat
at
tea
there
stalked
into
the
kitchen
a
nondescript
sort
of
dog
a
creature
of
fairish
size
of
a
rambling
structure
so
to
speak
coloured
a
puzzling
grayish
brown
with
underlying
hints
of
yellow
with
vast
drooping
ears
and
a
long
and
most
saturnine
countenance
quite
a
shock
it
gave
me
when
i
looked
up
to
find
the
beast
staring
at
me
with
what
i
took
to
be
the
most
hearty
disapproval
my
hostess
paused
in
silence
as
she
noted
my
glance
the
beast
then
approached
me
sniffed
at
my
boots
inquiringly
then
at
my
hands
with
increasing
animation
and
at
last
leaped
into
my
lap
and
had
licked
my
face
before
i
could
prevent
it
i
need
hardly
say
that
this
attention
was
embarrassing
and
most
distasteful
since
i
have
never
held
with
dogs
they
are
doubtless
well
enough
in
their
place
but
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
sentiment
about
them
that
is
silly
and
outside
the
hunting
field
the
most
finely
bred
of
them
are
too
apt
to
be
noisy
nuisances
when
i
say
that
the
beast
in
question
was
quite
an
american
dog
obviously
of
no
breeding
whatever
my
dismay
will
be
readily
imagined
rather
impulsively
i
confess
i
threw
him
to
the
floor
with
a
stern
begone
sir
whereat
he
merely
crawled
to
my
feet
and
whimpered
looking
up
into
my
eyes
with
a
most
horrid
and
sickening
air
of
devotion
hereupon
to
my
surprise
my
hostess
gayly
called
out
why
look
at
barker
he
s
actually
taken
up
with
you
right
away
and
him
usually
so
suspicious
of
strangers
only
yesterday
he
bit
an
agent
that
was
calling
with
silver
polish
to
sell
bit
him
in
the
leg
so
i
had
to
buy
some
from
the
poor
fellow
and
now
see
he
s
as
friendly
with
you
as
you
could
wish
they
do
say
that
dogs
know
when
people
are
all
right
look
at
him
trying
to
get
into
your
lap
and
indeed
the
beast
was
again
fawning
upon
me
in
the
most
abject
manner
licking
my
hands
and
seeming
to
express
for
me
some
hideous
admiration
seeing
that
i
repulsed
his
advances
none
too
gently
his
owner
called
to
him
down
barker
down
sir
get
out
she
continued
seeing
that
he
paid
her
no
attention
and
then
she
thoughtfully
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
to
a
safe
distance
where
she
held
him
he
nevertheless
continuing
to
regard
me
with
the
most
servile
affection
illustration
why
look
at
barker
he
s
actually
taken
up
with
you
right
away
and
him
usually
so
suspicious
of
strangers
ruggums
ruggums
ruggums
exploded
the
child
at
this
excitedly
waving
the
crust
of
its
bread
behave
barker
called
his
owner
again
the
gentleman
probably
doesn
t
want
you
climbing
all
over
the
remainder
of
my
visit
was
somewhat
marred
by
the
determination
of
barker
as
he
was
indeed
quite
seriously
called
to
force
his
monstrous
affections
upon
me
and
by
the
but
often
careless
efforts
of
his
mistress
to
restrain
him
she
indeed
appeared
to
believe
that
i
would
feel
immensely
pleased
at
these
tokens
of
his
liking
as
i
took
my
leave
after
sincere
expressions
of
my
pleasure
in
the
call
the
child
with
its
face
one
fearful
smear
of
jam
again
waved
its
crust
and
shouted
ruggums
while
the
dog
was
plainly
bent
on
departing
with
me
not
until
he
had
been
secured
by
a
rope
to
one
of
the
porch
stanchions
could
i
safely
leave
and
as
i
went
he
howled
dismally
after
violent
efforts
to
chew
the
detaining
rope
apart
i
finished
my
stroll
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
for
during
the
entire
hour
i
had
been
enabled
to
forget
the
manifold
cares
of
my
position
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
portrait
in
the
little
parlour
was
not
that
of
a
man
who
had
been
entirely
suited
to
this
worthy
and
energetic
young
woman
highly
deserving
she
seemed
and
when
i
knew
her
better
as
i
made
no
doubt
i
should
i
resolved
to
instruct
her
in
the
matter
of
a
more
suitable
diet
for
her
offspring
the
present
one
as
i
have
said
carrying
quite
too
large
a
preponderance
of
animal
fats
also
i
mused
upon
the
extraordinary
tolerance
she
accorded
to
the
but
too
demonstrative
barker
he
had
been
named
i
fancied
by
some
one
with
a
primitive
sense
of
humour
i
mean
to
say
he
might
have
been
facetiously
called
barker
because
he
actually
barked
a
bit
though
adding
the
mister
to
it
seemed
to
be
rather
forcing
the
poor
drollery
at
any
rate
i
was
glad
to
believe
i
should
see
little
of
him
in
his
free
state
and
yet
it
was
precisely
the
curious
fondness
of
this
brute
for
myself
that
now
added
to
my
embarrassments
on
two
succeeding
days
i
paused
briefly
at
judson
s
in
my
afternoon
strolls
finding
the
lady
as
wholesomely
reposeful
as
ever
in
her
effect
upon
my
nature
but
finding
the
unspeakable
dog
each
time
more
lavish
of
his
disgusting
affection
for
me
then
one
day
when
i
had
made
back
to
the
town
and
was
in
fact
traversing
the
main
commercial
thoroughfare
in
a
dignified
manner
i
was
made
aware
that
the
brute
had
broken
away
to
follow
me
close
at
my
heels
he
skulked
strong
words
hissed
under
my
breath
would
not
repulse
him
and
to
blows
i
durst
not
proceed
for
i
suddenly
divined
that
his
juxtaposition
to
me
was
exciting
amused
comment
among
certain
of
the
natives
who
observed
us
the
fellow
hobbs
in
the
doorway
of
his
was
especially
offensive
bursting
into
a
shout
of
boorish
laughter
and
directing
to
me
the
attention
of
a
nearby
group
of
loungers
who
likewise
professed
to
become
entertained
so
situated
i
was
of
course
obliged
to
affect
unconsciousness
of
the
awful
beast
and
he
was
presently
running
joyously
at
my
side
as
if
secure
in
my
approval
or
perhaps
his
brute
intelligence
divined
that
for
the
moment
i
durst
not
turn
upon
him
with
blows
nor
did
the
true
perversity
of
the
situation
at
once
occur
to
me
not
until
we
had
gained
one
of
the
residence
avenues
did
i
realize
the
significance
of
the
merriment
we
had
aroused
it
was
not
that
i
had
been
followed
by
a
random
cur
but
by
one
known
to
be
the
dog
of
the
lady
i
had
called
upon
i
mean
to
say
the
creature
had
advertised
my
acquaintance
with
his
owner
in
a
way
that
would
lead
base
minds
to
misconstrue
its
extent
thoroughly
maddened
by
this
thought
and
being
now
safely
beyond
close
observers
i
turned
upon
the
animal
to
give
it
a
hearty
drubbing
with
my
stick
but
it
drew
quickly
off
as
if
divining
my
intention
and
when
i
hurled
the
stick
at
it
retrieved
it
and
brought
it
to
me
quite
as
if
it
forgave
my
hostility
discovering
at
length
that
this
method
not
only
availed
nothing
but
was
bringing
faces
to
neighbouring
windows
and
that
it
did
not
the
slightest
good
to
speak
strongly
to
the
beast
i
had
perforce
to
accompany
it
to
its
home
where
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
its
owner
once
more
secure
it
firmly
with
the
rope
thus
far
a
trivial
annoyance
one
might
say
but
when
the
next
day
the
creature
bounded
up
to
me
as
i
escorted
homeward
two
ladies
from
the
onwards
and
upwards
club
leaping
upon
me
with
extravagant
manifestations
of
delight
and
trailing
a
length
of
gnawed
rope
it
will
be
seen
that
the
thing
was
little
short
of
serious
it
s
barker
exclaimed
one
of
the
ladies
regarding
me
brightly
at
a
cutlery
shop
i
then
bought
a
stout
chain
escorted
the
brute
to
his
home
and
saw
him
tethered
the
thing
was
rather
getting
on
me
the
following
morning
he
waited
for
me
at
the
floud
door
and
was
beside
himself
with
rapture
when
i
appeared
he
had
slipped
his
collar
and
once
more
i
saw
him
moored
each
time
i
had
apologized
to
judson
for
seeming
to
attract
her
pet
from
home
for
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
say
that
the
beast
was
highly
repugnant
to
me
and
least
of
all
could
i
intimate
that
his
public
devotion
to
me
would
be
seized
upon
by
the
coarser
village
wits
to
her
disadvantage
i
never
saw
him
so
fascinated
with
any
one
before
explained
the
lady
as
she
once
more
adjusted
his
leash
but
that
afternoon
as
i
waited
in
the
trap
for
jackson
before
the
the
beast
seemed
to
appear
from
out
the
earth
to
leap
into
the
trap
beside
me
after
a
rather
undignified
struggle
i
ejected
him
whereupon
he
followed
the
trap
madly
to
the
country
club
and
made
a
farce
of
my
golf
game
by
retrieving
the
ball
after
every
drive
this
time
i
learned
the
child
had
released
him
it
is
enough
to
add
that
for
those
remaining
days
until
the
present
the
unspeakable
creature
s
mad
infatuation
for
me
had
made
my
life
a
torment
to
say
nothing
of
its
being
a
matter
of
low
public
jesting
hardly
did
i
dare
show
myself
in
the
business
centres
for
as
surely
as
i
did
the
animal
found
me
and
crawled
to
fawn
upon
me
affecting
his
release
each
day
in
some
novel
manner
each
morning
i
looked
abroad
from
my
window
on
arising
more
than
likely
detecting
his
outstretched
form
on
the
walk
below
patiently
awaiting
my
appearance
and
each
night
i
was
liable
to
dreams
of
his
coming
upon
me
a
monstrous
creature
but
eager
tireless
resolute
determined
to
have
me
for
his
own
musing
desperately
over
this
impossible
state
of
affairs
i
was
now
surprised
to
receive
a
letter
from
the
wretched
cousin
egbert
sent
by
the
hand
of
the
tuttle
person
it
was
written
in
pencil
on
ruled
sheets
apparently
torn
from
a
cheap
notebook
quite
as
if
proper
pens
and
decent
stationery
were
not
to
be
had
and
ran
as
follows
dear
friend
bill
well
bill
i
know
god
hates
a
quitter
but
i
guess
i
got
a
streak
of
yellow
in
me
wider
than
the
comstock
lode
i
was
kicking
at
my
stirrups
even
before
i
seen
that
bunch
of
whiskers
and
when
i
took
a
flash
of
them
and
seen
he
was
intending
i
should
go
out
before
folks
without
any
regular
pants
on
i
says
i
can
be
pushed
just
so
far
well
bill
i
beat
it
like
a
bat
out
of
hell
as
i
guess
you
know
by
this
time
and
i
would
like
to
seen
them
catch
me
as
i
had
a
good
bronc
if
you
know
whose
bronc
it
was
tell
him
i
will
make
it
all
the
bronc
will
be
all
right
when
he
rests
up
some
well
bill
i
am
here
on
the
ranche
where
everything
is
nice
and
i
would
never
come
back
unless
certain
parties
agree
to
do
what
is
right
i
would
not
speak
pieces
that
way
for
the
president
of
the
if
he
ask
me
to
on
his
bended
knees
well
bill
i
wish
you
would
come
out
here
yourself
where
everything
is
nice
you
can
t
tell
what
that
bunch
of
crazies
would
be
wanting
you
to
do
next
thing
with
false
whiskers
and
no
right
pants
i
would
tell
them
i
can
be
pushed
just
so
far
and
now
i
will
go
out
to
the
ranche
with
for
some
time
where
things
are
well
bill
if
you
will
come
out
jeff
tuttle
will
bring
you
wednesday
when
he
comes
with
more
grub
and
you
will
find
everything
nice
i
have
told
jeff
to
bring
you
so
no
more
at
present
with
kind
regards
and
hoping
to
see
you
here
soon
your
true
friend
floud
effie
said
she
would
broaden
me
out
maybe
she
did
because
i
felt
pretty
flat
ha
ha
truth
to
tell
this
wild
suggestion
at
once
appealed
to
me
i
had
an
impulse
to
withdraw
for
a
season
from
the
social
whirl
to
seek
repose
among
the
glens
and
gorges
of
this
cattle
plantation
and
there
try
to
adjust
myself
more
intelligently
to
my
strange
new
environment
in
the
meantime
i
hoped
something
might
happen
to
the
dog
of
judson
or
he
might
perhaps
in
my
absence
outlive
his
curious
mania
for
me
effie
whom
i
now
consulted
after
reading
the
letter
of
cousin
egbert
proved
to
be
in
favour
of
my
going
to
him
to
make
one
last
appeal
to
his
higher
nature
if
only
he
d
stick
out
there
in
the
brush
where
he
belongs
i
d
let
him
stay
she
explained
but
he
won
t
stick
he
gets
tired
after
awhile
and
drops
in
perhaps
on
the
very
night
when
we
re
entertaining
some
of
the
best
people
at
dinner
and
of
course
we
re
obliged
to
have
him
though
he
s
dropped
whatever
manners
i
ve
taught
him
and
picked
up
his
old
rough
talk
and
he
eats
until
you
wonder
how
he
can
it
s
awful
sometimes
i
ve
wondered
if
it
couldn
t
be
adenoids
there
s
a
lot
of
talk
about
those
just
now
some
very
select
people
have
them
and
perhaps
they
re
what
kept
him
back
and
made
him
so
hopelessly
low
in
his
tastes
but
i
just
know
he
d
never
go
to
a
doctor
about
them
for
heaven
s
sake
use
what
influence
you
have
to
get
him
back
here
and
to
take
his
rightful
place
in
i
had
a
profound
conviction
that
he
would
never
take
his
rightful
place
in
society
be
it
the
fault
of
adenoids
or
whatever
that
low
passion
of
his
for
being
pally
with
all
sorts
made
it
seem
that
his
sense
of
values
must
have
been
at
fault
from
birth
and
yet
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
abandon
him
utterly
for
as
i
have
intimated
something
in
the
fellow
s
nature
appealed
to
me
i
accordingly
murmured
my
sympathy
discreetly
and
set
about
preparations
for
my
journey
feeling
instinctively
that
cousin
egbert
would
not
now
be
dressing
for
dinner
i
omitted
evening
clothes
from
my
box
including
only
a
and
one
of
tweeds
which
i
fancied
would
do
me
well
enough
but
no
sooner
was
my
box
packed
than
the
tuttle
person
informed
me
that
i
could
take
no
box
whatever
it
appeared
that
all
luggage
would
be
strapped
to
the
backs
of
animals
and
thus
transported
even
so
when
i
had
reduced
myself
to
one
park
and
a
small
bundle
of
necessary
adjuncts
i
was
told
that
the
must
be
left
behind
it
appeared
there
would
be
no
golf
and
so
quite
early
one
morning
i
started
on
this
curious
pilgrimage
from
what
was
called
a
feed
corral
in
a
low
part
of
the
town
here
the
tuttle
person
had
assembled
a
of
a
animals
the
luggage
being
adjusted
to
their
backs
by
himself
and
two
assistants
all
using
language
of
the
most
disgraceful
character
throughout
the
process
the
tuttle
person
i
had
half
expected
to
appear
garbed
in
his
native
dress
effie
had
once
more
referred
to
that
indian
jeff
tuttle
but
he
wore
instead
as
did
his
two
assistants
the
outing
or
lounge
suit
of
the
western
desperado
nor
though
i
listened
closely
could
i
hear
him
exclaim
ugh
ugh
in
moments
of
emotional
stress
as
my
reading
had
informed
me
that
the
indian
frequently
does
the
two
assistants
fellows
bore
the
curious
american
names
of
hank
and
buck
and
furiously
chewed
the
tobacco
plant
at
all
times
after
betraying
a
momentary
interest
in
my
smart
they
paid
me
little
attention
at
which
i
was
well
pleased
for
their
manners
were
often
repellent
and
their
abrupt
direct
fashion
of
speech
quite
disconcerting
the
tuttle
person
welcomed
me
heartily
and
himself
adjusted
the
saddle
to
my
mount
expressing
the
hope
that
i
would
get
my
fill
of
scenery
and
volunteering
the
information
that
my
destination
was
one
sleep
away
chapter
eleven
although
fond
of
rural
surroundings
and
always
interested
in
nature
the
adventure
in
which
i
had
become
involved
is
not
one
i
can
recommend
to
a
person
of
refined
tastes
i
found
it
little
enough
to
my
own
taste
even
during
the
first
two
hours
of
travel
when
we
kept
to
the
beaten
thoroughfare
for
the
sun
was
hot
the
dust
stifling
and
the
language
with
which
the
were
berated
coarse
in
the
extreme
yet
from
this
plain
roadway
and
a
country
of
rolling
down
and
heather
which
was
at
least
not
terrifying
our
leader
the
tuttle
person
swerved
all
at
once
into
an
untried
jungle
in
what
at
the
moment
i
supposed
to
be
a
fit
of
following
a
narrow
path
that
led
up
a
fearsomely
slanted
incline
among
trees
and
boulders
of
granite
thrown
about
in
the
greatest
disorder
he
was
followed
however
by
the
and
by
the
two
so
that
i
soon
saw
the
new
course
must
be
intended
the
mountains
were
now
literally
quite
everywhere
some
higher
than
others
but
all
of
a
rough
appearance
and
uninviting
in
the
extreme
the
narrow
path
moreover
became
more
and
more
difficult
and
seemed
altogether
quite
insane
with
its
twistings
and
fearsome
declivities
one
s
first
thought
was
that
at
least
a
bit
of
might
have
been
put
upon
it
but
there
was
no
sign
of
this
throughout
our
toilsome
day
nor
did
i
once
observe
a
rustic
seat
along
the
way
although
i
saw
an
abundance
of
suitable
nooks
for
these
needless
to
say
in
all
england
there
is
not
an
estate
so
poorly
kept
up
there
being
no
halt
made
for
luncheon
i
began
to
look
forward
to
but
what
was
my
dismay
to
observe
that
this
hour
also
passed
unnoted
not
until
night
was
drawing
upon
us
did
our
caravan
halt
beside
a
tarn
and
here
i
learned
that
we
would
sup
and
sleep
although
it
was
distressing
to
observe
how
remote
we
were
from
proper
surroundings
there
was
no
shelter
and
no
modern
conveniences
not
even
a
or
there
was
of
course
no
central
heating
and
no
electricity
for
one
s
so
that
one
s
clothing
must
become
quite
disreputable
for
want
of
pressing
also
the
informal
manner
of
cooking
and
eating
was
not
what
i
had
been
accustomed
to
and
the
idea
of
sleeping
publicly
on
the
bare
ground
was
repugnant
in
the
extreme
i
mean
to
say
there
was
no
truly
it
was
a
coarser
type
of
wilderness
than
that
which
i
had
encountered
near
new
york
city
the
animals
being
unladen
were
fitted
with
a
species
of
leather
bracelet
about
their
forefeet
and
allowed
to
stray
at
their
will
a
fire
was
built
and
coarse
food
made
ready
it
is
hardly
a
thing
to
speak
of
but
their
manner
of
preparing
tea
was
utterly
depraved
the
leaves
being
flung
into
a
tin
of
boiling
water
and
allowed
to
the
result
was
something
that
i
imagine
etchers
might
use
in
making
lines
upon
their
metal
plates
but
for
my
day
s
fast
i
should
have
been
unequal
to
this
or
to
the
crude
output
of
their
yet
i
was
indeed
glad
that
no
sign
of
my
dismay
had
escaped
me
for
the
hank
and
buck
as
i
discovered
had
given
unusual
care
to
the
repast
on
my
account
and
i
should
not
have
liked
to
seem
unappreciative
quite
by
accident
i
overheard
the
honest
fellows
quarrelling
about
an
oversight
they
had
it
seemed
left
the
behind
each
was
bitterly
blaming
the
other
for
this
seeming
to
feel
that
the
meal
could
not
go
forward
i
had
not
to
be
told
that
they
would
not
ordinarily
carry
for
their
own
use
and
that
the
forgotten
utensils
must
have
been
meant
solely
for
my
comfort
accordingly
when
the
quarrel
was
at
its
highest
i
broke
in
upon
it
protesting
that
the
oversight
was
of
no
consequence
and
that
i
was
quite
prepared
to
roughen
it
with
them
in
the
best
of
good
fellowship
they
were
unable
to
conceal
their
chagrin
at
my
having
overheard
them
and
slunk
off
abashed
to
the
it
was
plain
that
under
their
repellent
exteriors
they
concealed
veins
of
the
finest
chivalry
and
i
took
pains
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
to
put
them
at
their
ease
asking
them
many
questions
about
their
wild
life
of
the
dangers
of
the
jungle
by
which
we
were
surrounded
the
most
formidable
it
seemed
was
not
the
grizzly
bear
of
which
i
had
read
but
an
animal
quaintly
called
the
which
lurks
about
such
as
ours
and
is
often
known
to
attack
man
in
its
search
for
tinned
milk
of
which
it
is
inordinately
fond
the
spoor
of
one
of
these
beasts
had
been
detected
near
our
campfire
by
the
called
buck
and
he
now
told
us
of
it
though
having
at
first
resolved
to
be
silent
rather
than
alarm
us
as
we
carried
a
supply
of
the
animal
s
favourite
food
i
was
given
two
of
the
tins
with
instructions
to
hurl
them
quickly
at
any
that
might
approach
during
the
night
my
companions
arming
themselves
in
a
similar
manner
it
appears
that
the
beast
has
tushes
similar
in
shape
to
tin
openers
with
which
it
deftly
bites
into
any
tins
of
milk
that
may
be
thrown
at
it
the
person
called
hank
had
once
escaped
with
his
life
only
by
means
of
a
tin
of
milk
which
had
caught
on
the
sabrelike
tushes
of
the
animal
pursuing
him
thus
rendering
him
harmless
and
easy
of
capture
needless
to
say
i
was
greatly
interested
in
this
animal
of
the
quaint
name
and
resolved
to
remain
on
watch
during
the
night
in
the
hope
of
seeing
one
but
at
this
juncture
we
were
rejoined
by
the
tuttle
person
who
proceeded
to
recount
to
hank
and
buck
a
highly
coloured
version
of
my
regrettable
encounter
with
back
in
the
new
york
wilderness
whereat
they
both
lost
interest
in
the
and
greatly
embarrassed
me
with
their
congratulations
upon
this
lesser
matter
cousin
egbert
it
seemed
had
most
indiscreetly
talked
of
the
thing
which
was
now
a
matter
of
common
gossip
in
red
gap
thereafter
i
could
get
from
them
no
further
information
about
the
habits
of
the
nor
did
i
remain
awake
to
watch
for
one
as
i
had
resolved
to
the
fatigues
of
the
day
proving
too
much
for
me
but
doubtless
none
approached
during
the
night
as
the
two
tins
of
milk
with
which
i
was
armed
were
untouched
when
i
awoke
at
dawn
again
we
set
off
after
a
barbarous
breakfast
driving
our
laden
animals
ever
deeper
into
the
mountain
fastness
until
it
seemed
that
none
of
us
could
ever
emerge
for
i
had
ascertained
that
there
was
not
a
compass
in
the
party
there
was
now
a
certain
new
friendliness
in
the
manner
of
the
two
toward
me
born
it
would
seem
of
their
knowledge
of
my
assault
upon
and
i
was
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
receive
this
well
intentioned
though
it
was
i
mean
to
say
they
were
undoubtedly
of
the
and
of
course
one
must
remember
one
s
own
position
but
i
at
length
decided
to
be
quite
friendly
and
american
with
them
the
truth
must
be
told
that
i
was
now
feeling
in
quite
a
bit
of
a
funk
and
should
have
welcomed
any
friendship
offered
me
i
even
found
myself
remembering
with
rather
a
pensive
tolerance
the
attentions
of
barker
though
doubtless
back
in
red
gap
i
should
have
found
them
as
loathsome
as
ever
my
hump
was
due
i
made
no
doubt
first
to
my
precarious
position
in
the
wilderness
but
more
than
that
to
my
anomalous
social
position
for
it
seemed
to
me
now
that
i
was
neither
fish
nor
fowl
i
was
no
longer
a
gentleman
s
man
the
familiar
boundaries
of
that
office
had
been
swept
away
on
the
other
hand
i
was
most
emphatically
not
the
gentleman
i
had
set
myself
up
to
be
and
i
was
weary
of
the
pretence
the
friendliness
of
these
uncouth
companions
then
proved
doubly
welcome
for
with
them
i
could
conduct
myself
in
a
natural
manner
happily
forgetting
my
former
limitations
and
my
present
quite
fictitious
dignities
i
even
found
myself
talking
to
them
of
cricket
as
we
rode
telling
them
i
had
once
hit
an
eight
fully
run
out
it
was
and
not
an
overthrow
though
i
dare
say
it
meant
little
to
them
i
also
took
pains
to
describe
to
them
the
correct
method
of
brewing
tea
which
they
promised
thereafter
to
observe
though
this
i
fear
they
did
from
mere
politeness
our
way
continued
adventurously
upward
until
when
we
began
an
equally
adventurous
descent
through
a
jungle
of
pine
trees
not
a
few
of
which
would
have
done
credit
to
one
of
our
own
parks
though
there
were
of
course
too
many
of
them
here
to
be
at
all
effective
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
from
a
scenic
standpoint
everything
through
which
we
had
passed
was
overdone
mountains
rocks
streams
trees
all
sounding
a
characteristic
american
note
of
exaggeration
then
at
last
we
came
to
the
wilderness
abode
of
cousin
egbert
a
rude
hut
of
native
logs
it
was
set
in
this
highland
glen
beside
a
tarn
from
afar
we
descried
its
smoke
and
presently
in
the
doorway
observed
cousin
egbert
himself
who
waved
cheerfully
at
us
his
appearance
gave
me
a
shock
quite
aware
of
his
inclination
to
laxness
i
was
yet
unprepared
for
his
present
state
never
indeed
have
i
seen
a
man
so
badly
turned
out
too
evidently
unshaven
since
his
disappearance
he
was
gotten
up
in
a
faded
flannel
shirt
open
at
the
neck
and
without
the
sign
of
cravat
a
pair
of
overalls
also
faded
and
quite
wretchedly
spotty
and
boots
of
the
most
shocking
description
yet
in
spite
of
this
dreadful
tenue
he
greeted
me
without
embarrassment
and
indeed
with
a
kind
of
artless
pleasure
truly
the
man
was
impossible
and
when
i
observed
the
placard
he
had
allowed
to
remain
on
the
waistband
of
his
overalls
boastfully
alleging
their
indestructibility
my
sympathies
flew
back
to
effie
there
was
a
cartoon
emblazoned
on
this
placard
depicting
the
futile
efforts
of
two
teams
of
stout
horses
each
attached
to
a
leg
of
the
garment
to
wrench
it
in
twain
i
mean
to
say
one
might
be
reduced
to
overalls
but
this
blatant
emblem
was
not
a
thing
any
gentleman
need
have
retained
and
again
observing
his
footgear
i
was
glad
to
recall
that
i
had
included
a
plentiful
supply
of
in
my
scanty
luggage
three
of
the
were
now
unladen
their
burden
of
provisions
being
piled
beside
the
door
while
cousin
egbert
chatted
gayly
with
the
and
the
indian
tuttle
after
which
these
three
took
their
leave
being
madly
bent
it
appeared
upon
penetrating
still
farther
into
the
wilderness
to
another
cattle
farm
then
left
alone
with
cousin
egbert
i
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
strictly
speaking
he
had
no
establishment
not
only
were
there
no
servants
but
there
were
no
drains
no
no
no
scullery
no
central
heating
no
electric
wiring
his
hut
consisted
of
but
a
single
room
and
this
without
a
floor
other
than
the
packed
earth
while
the
appointments
were
such
as
in
any
civilized
country
would
have
indicated
the
direst
poverty
two
beds
of
the
rudest
description
stood
in
opposite
corners
and
one
end
of
the
room
was
almost
wholly
occupied
by
a
stone
fireplace
of
primitive
construction
over
which
the
owner
now
hovered
in
certain
feats
of
cookery
thanks
to
my
famished
state
i
was
in
no
mood
to
criticise
his
efforts
which
he
presently
set
forth
upon
the
rough
deal
table
in
a
hearty
but
quite
inelegant
manner
the
meal
i
am
bound
to
say
was
more
than
welcome
to
my
now
indiscriminating
palate
though
at
a
less
urgent
moment
i
should
doubtless
have
found
the
bread
soggy
and
the
beans
a
pernicious
mass
there
was
a
stew
of
venison
however
which
only
the
most
skilful
hands
could
have
bettered
though
how
the
man
had
obtained
a
deer
was
beyond
me
since
it
was
evident
he
possessed
no
shooting
or
costume
as
to
the
tea
i
made
bold
to
speak
my
mind
and
succeeded
in
brewing
some
for
myself
throughout
the
repast
cousin
egbert
was
constantly
attentive
to
my
needs
and
was
more
cheerful
of
demeanour
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
the
hunted
look
about
his
eyes
which
had
heretofore
always
distinguished
him
was
now
gone
and
he
bore
himself
like
a
free
man
yes
sir
he
said
as
we
smoked
over
the
remains
of
the
meal
you
stay
with
me
and
i
ll
give
you
one
swell
little
time
i
ll
do
the
cooking
and
between
whiles
we
can
sit
right
here
and
play
cribbage
day
in
and
day
out
you
can
get
a
taste
of
real
life
without
i
saw
then
if
never
before
that
his
deeper
nature
would
not
be
aroused
doubtless
my
passing
success
with
him
in
paris
had
marked
the
very
highest
stage
of
his
spiritual
development
i
did
not
need
to
be
told
now
that
he
had
left
off
forever
nor
did
i
waste
words
in
trying
to
recall
him
to
his
better
self
indeed
for
the
moment
i
was
too
overwhelmed
by
fatigue
even
to
remonstrate
about
his
wretched
and
i
early
fell
asleep
on
one
of
the
beds
while
he
was
still
engaged
in
washing
the
metal
dishes
upon
which
we
had
eaten
singing
the
while
the
doleful
ballad
of
rosalie
the
prairie
it
seemed
but
a
moment
later
that
i
awoke
for
cousin
egbert
was
again
busy
among
the
dishes
but
i
saw
that
another
day
had
come
and
his
song
had
changed
to
one
equally
sad
but
quite
different
in
the
hazel
dell
my
nellie
s
sleeping
he
sang
though
in
a
low
voice
and
quite
cheerfully
indeed
his
entire
repertoire
of
ballads
was
confined
to
the
saddest
themes
chiefly
of
desirable
maidens
taken
off
untimely
either
by
disease
or
accident
besides
rosalie
the
prairie
flower
there
was
lovely
annie
lisle
over
whom
the
willows
waved
and
earthly
music
could
not
waken
another
named
sweet
alice
ben
bolt
lying
in
the
churchyard
and
still
another
lily
dale
who
was
pictured
neath
the
trees
in
the
flowery
vale
with
the
wild
rose
blossoming
o
er
the
little
green
grave
his
face
was
indeed
sad
as
he
rendered
these
woful
ballads
and
yet
his
voice
and
manner
were
of
the
cheeriest
and
i
dare
say
he
sang
without
reference
to
their
real
tragedy
it
was
a
school
of
american
balladry
quite
at
variance
with
the
cheerful
optimism
of
those
i
had
heard
from
the
phonograph
where
the
persons
are
not
dead
at
all
but
are
gayly
calling
upon
one
another
to
come
on
and
do
a
folkdance
or
hear
a
band
or
crawl
under
things
of
that
sort
as
cousin
egbert
bent
over
a
frying
pan
in
which
ham
was
cooking
he
crooned
softly
in
the
hazel
dell
my
nellie
s
sleeping
nellie
loved
so
long
while
my
lonely
lonely
watch
i
m
keeping
nellie
lost
and
i
could
attribute
his
choice
only
to
that
natural
perversity
which
prompted
him
always
to
do
the
wrong
thing
for
surely
this
affecting
verse
was
not
meant
to
be
sung
at
such
a
moment
attempting
to
arise
i
became
aware
that
the
two
days
journey
had
left
me
sadly
lame
and
wayworn
also
that
my
face
was
burned
from
the
sun
and
that
i
had
been
awakened
too
soon
fortunately
i
had
with
me
a
shilling
jar
of
ridley
s
society
complexion
food
the
wonder
which
i
applied
to
my
face
with
cooling
results
and
i
then
felt
able
to
partake
of
a
bit
of
the
breakfast
which
cousin
egbert
now
brought
to
my
bedside
the
ham
was
of
course
not
cooked
correctly
and
the
tea
was
again
a
mere
corrosive
but
so
anxious
was
my
host
to
please
me
that
i
refrained
from
any
criticism
though
at
another
time
i
should
have
told
him
straight
what
i
thought
of
such
cookery
when
we
had
both
eaten
i
slept
again
to
the
accompaniment
of
another
sad
song
and
the
muted
rattle
of
the
pans
as
cousin
egbert
did
the
scullery
work
and
it
was
long
past
the
luncheon
hour
when
i
awoke
still
lame
from
the
saddle
but
greatly
refreshed
it
was
now
that
another
blow
befell
me
for
upon
arising
and
searching
through
my
kit
i
discovered
that
my
razors
had
been
left
behind
by
any
thinking
man
the
effect
of
this
oversight
will
be
instantly
perceived
already
low
in
spirits
the
prospect
of
going
unshaven
could
but
aggravate
my
funk
i
surrendered
to
the
wave
of
homesickness
that
swept
over
me
i
wanted
london
again
london
with
its
yellow
fog
and
greasy
pavements
i
wished
to
buy
cockles
off
a
barrow
i
longed
for
toasted
crumpets
and
most
of
all
i
longed
for
my
old
rightful
station
longed
to
turn
out
a
gentleman
longed
for
the
honourable
george
and
our
peaceful
if
sometimes
precarious
existence
among
people
of
the
right
sort
the
continued
shocks
since
that
fateful
night
of
the
cards
had
told
upon
me
i
knew
now
that
i
had
not
been
meant
for
adventure
yet
here
i
had
turned
up
in
the
most
savage
of
lands
after
leading
a
life
of
dishonest
pretence
in
a
station
to
which
i
had
not
been
born
and
for
i
knew
not
how
many
days
i
should
not
be
able
to
shave
my
face
but
here
again
a
ferment
stirred
in
my
blood
some
electric
thrill
of
anarchy
which
had
come
from
association
with
these
americans
a
strange
lawless
impulse
toward
their
quite
absurd
ideals
of
equality
a
monstrous
ambition
to
be
in
myself
some
one
that
mattered
instead
of
that
pretended
colonel
ruggles
who
i
now
recalled
was
promised
to
bridge
at
the
home
of
judge
ballard
where
he
would
talk
of
hunting
in
the
shires
of
the
royal
enclosure
at
ascot
of
hurlingham
and
ranleigh
of
cowes
in
june
of
the
excellence
of
the
converts
at
no
doubt
it
was
a
sort
of
madness
now
seized
me
consequent
upon
the
lack
of
shaving
utensils
i
wondered
desperately
if
there
was
a
true
place
for
me
in
this
life
i
had
tasted
their
equality
that
day
of
debauch
in
paris
but
obviously
the
sensation
could
not
permanently
be
maintained
upon
spirits
perhaps
i
might
obtain
a
post
in
a
bank
i
might
become
a
even
a
pressman
these
moody
and
unwholesome
thoughts
were
clouding
my
mind
as
i
surveyed
myself
in
the
wrinkled
mirror
which
had
seemed
to
suffice
the
uncritical
cousin
egbert
for
his
toilet
it
hung
between
the
portrait
of
a
champion
crouching
in
position
and
the
calendar
advertisement
of
a
brewery
which
as
i
could
not
fancy
cousin
egbert
being
in
the
least
concerned
about
the
day
of
the
month
had
too
evidently
been
hung
on
his
wall
because
of
the
coloured
lithograph
of
a
blond
creature
in
theatrical
undress
who
smirked
most
immorally
studying
the
curiously
wavy
effect
this
glass
produced
upon
my
face
i
chanced
to
observe
in
a
corner
of
the
frame
a
printed
card
with
the
heading
take
courage
to
my
surprise
the
thing
when
i
had
read
it
capped
my
black
musings
upon
my
position
in
a
rather
uncanny
way
briefly
it
recited
the
humble
beginnings
of
a
score
or
more
of
the
world
s
notable
figures
demosthenes
was
the
son
of
a
cutler
it
began
horace
was
the
son
of
a
shopkeeper
virgil
s
father
was
a
porter
cardinal
wolsey
was
the
son
of
a
butcher
shakespeare
the
son
of
a
followed
the
obscure
parentage
of
such
persons
as
milton
napoleon
columbus
cromwell
even
mohammed
was
noted
as
a
shepherd
and
though
it
seemed
rather
questionable
taste
to
include
in
the
list
one
whose
religion
as
to
family
life
was
rather
scandalous
more
to
the
point
was
the
citation
of
various
americans
who
had
sprung
from
humble
beginnings
lincoln
johnson
grant
garfield
edison
it
is
true
that
there
was
not
apparently
a
gentleman
s
servant
among
them
they
were
boatmen
tailors
artisans
of
sorts
but
the
combined
effect
was
rather
overwhelming
from
the
first
moment
of
my
encountering
the
american
social
system
it
seemed
i
had
been
by
way
of
becoming
a
rabid
anarchist
that
is
one
feeling
that
he
might
become
a
gentleman
regardless
of
his
birth
and
here
were
the
disconcerting
facts
concerning
a
score
of
notables
to
confirm
me
in
my
heresy
it
was
not
a
thing
to
be
spoken
lightly
of
in
loose
discussion
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
at
this
moment
i
coldly
questioned
the
soundness
of
our
british
system
the
vital
marrow
of
which
is
to
teach
that
there
is
a
difference
between
men
and
men
to
be
sure
it
will
have
been
seen
that
i
was
not
myself
having
for
a
quarter
year
been
subjected
to
a
series
of
nervous
shocks
and
having
had
my
mind
contaminated
moreover
by
being
brought
into
daily
contact
with
this
unthinking
american
equality
in
the
person
of
cousin
egbert
who
i
make
bold
to
assert
had
never
for
one
instant
since
his
doubtless
obscure
birth
considered
himself
the
superior
of
any
human
being
whatsoever
this
much
i
advance
for
myself
in
extenuation
of
my
lawless
imaginings
but
of
them
i
can
abate
no
jot
it
was
all
at
once
clear
to
me
monstrous
as
it
may
seem
that
nature
and
the
british
empire
were
at
variance
in
their
decrees
and
that
somehow
a
system
was
base
which
taught
that
one
man
is
necessarily
inferior
to
another
i
dare
say
it
was
a
sort
of
poisonous
intoxication
that
i
should
all
at
once
declare
his
lordship
tenth
earl
of
brinstead
and
marmaduke
ruggles
are
two
men
one
has
made
an
acceptable
peer
and
one
an
acceptable
valet
yet
the
twain
are
equal
and
the
system
which
has
made
one
inferior
socially
to
the
other
is
false
and
bad
and
can
not
for
a
moment
i
repeat
i
saw
myself
a
gentleman
in
the
making
a
clear
fairway
without
bunkers
from
tee
to
green
meeting
my
equals
with
a
friendly
eye
and
then
the
illumining
shock
for
i
unconsciously
added
to
myself
regarding
my
inferiors
with
a
kindly
it
was
there
i
caught
myself
so
much
a
part
of
the
system
was
i
that
although
i
could
readily
conceive
a
society
in
which
i
had
no
superiors
i
could
not
picture
one
in
which
i
had
not
inferiors
the
same
poison
that
ran
in
the
veins
of
their
lordships
ran
also
in
the
veins
of
their
servants
i
was
indeed
it
appeared
hopelessly
inoculated
again
i
read
the
card
horace
was
the
son
of
a
shopkeeper
but
i
made
no
doubt
that
after
he
became
a
popular
and
successful
writer
of
latin
verse
he
looked
down
upon
his
own
father
only
could
it
have
been
otherwise
i
thought
had
he
been
born
in
this
fermenting
america
to
no
station
whatever
and
left
to
achieve
his
rightful
one
so
i
mused
thus
licentiously
until
one
clear
conviction
possessed
me
that
i
would
no
longer
pretend
to
the
social
superiority
of
one
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
i
would
concede
no
inferiority
in
myself
but
i
would
not
again
before
red
gap
s
county
families
vaunt
myself
as
other
than
i
was
that
this
was
more
than
a
vagrant
fancy
on
my
part
will
be
seen
when
i
aver
that
suddenly
strangely
alarmingly
i
no
longer
cared
that
i
was
unshaven
and
must
remain
so
for
an
untold
number
of
days
i
welcomed
the
unhandsome
stubble
that
now
projected
itself
upon
my
face
i
curiously
wished
all
at
once
to
be
as
badly
gotten
up
as
cousin
egbert
with
as
little
thought
for
my
station
in
life
i
would
no
longer
refrain
from
doing
things
because
they
were
not
my
own
taste
would
be
the
law
it
was
at
this
moment
that
cousin
egbert
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
four
trout
from
the
stream
nearby
though
how
he
had
managed
to
snare
them
i
could
not
think
since
he
possessed
no
correct
equipment
for
angling
i
fancy
i
rather
overwhelmed
him
by
exclaiming
hello
since
never
before
had
i
addressed
him
in
any
save
a
formal
fashion
and
it
is
certain
i
embarrassed
him
by
my
next
proceeding
which
was
to
grasp
his
hand
and
shake
it
heartily
an
action
that
i
could
explain
no
more
than
he
except
that
the
violence
of
my
was
still
upon
me
and
required
an
outlet
he
grinned
amiably
then
regarded
me
with
a
shrewd
eye
and
demanded
if
i
had
been
drinking
this
i
said
i
am
drunk
with
this
and
held
the
card
up
to
him
but
when
he
took
it
interestedly
he
merely
read
the
obverse
side
which
i
had
not
observed
until
now
go
to
epstein
s
for
everything
you
wear
it
said
in
large
type
and
added
the
square
deal
mammoth
they
carry
a
nice
stock
he
said
still
a
bit
puzzled
by
my
tone
though
i
generally
trade
at
the
red
i
turned
the
card
over
for
him
and
he
studied
the
list
of
notables
though
from
a
point
of
view
peculiarly
his
own
i
don
t
see
he
began
what
right
they
got
to
rake
up
all
that
stuff
about
people
that
s
dead
and
gone
who
cares
what
their
folks
was
and
he
added
horace
was
the
son
of
a
shopkeeper
horace
who
plainly
the
matter
did
not
excite
him
and
i
saw
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
convey
to
him
what
the
items
had
meant
to
me
i
mean
to
say
i
m
glad
to
be
here
with
you
i
said
i
knew
you
d
like
it
he
answered
everything
is
nice
america
is
some
country
i
said
she
is
she
is
he
answered
and
now
you
can
bile
up
a
pot
of
tea
in
your
own
way
while
i
clean
these
here
fish
for
i
made
the
tea
i
regret
to
say
there
was
not
a
tea
cozy
in
the
place
indeed
the
linen
silver
and
general
table
equipment
were
sadly
deficient
but
in
my
reckless
mood
i
made
no
comment
your
tea
smells
good
but
it
ain
t
got
no
kick
to
it
he
observed
over
his
first
cup
when
i
drench
my
insides
with
tea
i
sort
of
want
it
to
take
a
and
still
i
made
no
effort
to
set
him
right
i
now
saw
that
in
all
true
essentials
he
did
not
need
me
to
set
him
right
for
so
uncouth
a
person
he
was
strangely
commendable
and
worthy
as
we
sipped
our
tea
in
companionable
silence
i
busy
with
my
new
and
disturbing
thoughts
a
long
shout
came
to
us
from
the
outer
distance
cousin
egbert
brightened
i
m
darned
if
that
ain
t
ma
pettengill
he
exclaimed
she
s
rid
over
from
the
we
rushed
to
the
door
and
in
the
distance
riding
down
upon
us
at
terrific
speed
i
indeed
beheld
the
mixer
a
moment
later
she
reigned
in
her
horse
before
us
and
hoarsely
rumbled
her
greetings
i
had
last
seen
her
at
a
formal
dinner
where
she
was
rather
formidably
done
out
in
black
velvet
and
diamonds
now
she
appeared
in
a
startling
tenue
of
khaki
and
flannel
shirt
with
one
of
the
hats
even
at
the
moment
of
greeting
her
i
could
not
but
reflect
how
shocked
our
dear
queen
would
be
at
the
sight
of
this
riding
habit
she
dismounted
with
hearty
explanations
of
how
she
had
left
her
and
ridden
over
to
visit
having
heard
from
the
tuttle
person
that
we
were
here
cousin
egbert
took
her
horse
and
she
entered
the
hut
where
to
my
utter
amazement
she
at
once
did
a
feminine
thing
though
from
her
garb
one
at
a
little
distance
might
have
thought
her
a
man
a
portly
florid
carelessly
attired
man
she
made
at
once
for
the
wrinkled
mirror
where
after
anxiously
scanning
her
burned
face
for
an
instant
she
produced
powder
and
puff
from
a
pocket
of
her
shirt
and
daintily
powdered
her
generous
blob
of
a
nose
having
achieved
this
to
her
apparent
satisfaction
she
unrolled
a
bundle
she
had
carried
at
her
saddle
and
donned
a
riding
skirt
buttoning
it
about
the
waist
and
smoothing
down
its
folds
before
i
could
retire
there
now
she
boomed
as
if
some
satisfying
finality
had
been
brought
about
such
was
the
mixer
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
with
us
and
yet
i
suddenly
saw
that
she
like
cousin
egbert
was
strangely
commendable
and
worthy
i
mean
to
say
i
no
longer
felt
it
was
my
part
to
set
her
right
in
any
of
the
social
niceties
some
curious
change
had
come
upon
me
i
knew
then
that
i
should
no
longer
resist
america
chapter
twelve
with
a
curious
friendly
glow
upon
me
i
set
about
helping
cousin
egbert
in
the
preparation
of
our
evening
meal
a
work
from
which
owing
to
the
number
and
apparent
difficulty
of
my
suggestions
he
presently
withdrew
leaving
me
in
entire
charge
it
is
quite
true
that
i
have
pronounced
views
as
to
the
preparation
and
serving
of
food
and
i
dare
say
i
embarrassed
the
worthy
fellow
without
at
all
meaning
to
do
so
for
too
many
of
his
culinary
efforts
betray
the
fumbling
touch
of
the
amateur
and
as
i
worked
over
the
open
fire
doing
the
trout
to
a
turn
stirring
the
beans
and
perfecting
the
stew
with
deft
touches
of
seasoning
i
worded
to
myself
for
the
first
time
a
most
severe
indictment
against
the
north
american
cookery
based
upon
my
observations
across
the
continent
and
my
experience
as
a
in
red
gap
i
saw
that
it
would
never
do
with
us
and
that
it
ought
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
be
uplifted
even
then
while
our
guest
chattered
gossip
of
the
town
over
her
brown
paper
cigarettes
i
felt
the
stirring
of
an
impulse
to
teach
americans
how
to
do
themselves
better
at
table
for
the
moment
of
course
i
was
hampered
by
lack
of
equipment
there
was
not
even
a
fish
slice
in
the
establishment
but
even
so
i
brewed
proper
tea
and
was
able
to
impart
to
the
simple
viands
a
touch
of
distinction
which
they
had
lacked
under
cousin
egbert
s
manipulation
as
i
served
the
repast
cousin
egbert
produced
a
bottle
of
the
brown
american
whiskey
at
which
we
pegged
a
bit
before
sitting
to
table
three
rousing
cheers
said
he
and
the
mixer
responded
with
happy
days
as
on
that
former
occasion
the
draught
of
spirits
flooded
my
being
with
a
vast
consciousness
of
personal
worth
and
of
good
feeling
toward
my
companions
with
a
true
insight
i
suddenly
perceived
that
one
might
belong
to
the
great
lower
in
america
and
still
matter
in
the
truest
correctest
sense
of
the
term
as
we
fell
hungrily
to
the
food
the
mixer
did
not
fail
to
praise
my
cooking
of
the
trout
and
she
and
cousin
egbert
were
presently
lamenting
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
a
meal
in
red
gap
at
this
i
boldly
spoke
up
declaring
that
american
cookery
lacked
constructive
imagination
making
only
the
barest
use
of
its
magnificent
opportunities
following
certain
beaten
and
roads
with
a
slavish
stupidity
we
nearly
had
a
good
restaurant
said
the
mixer
a
frenchman
came
and
showed
us
a
little
flash
of
form
but
he
only
lasted
a
month
because
he
got
homesick
he
had
half
the
people
in
town
going
there
for
dinner
too
to
get
away
from
their
chinamen
and
after
i
spent
a
lot
of
money
fixing
the
place
up
for
him
i
recalled
the
establishment
on
the
main
street
though
i
had
not
known
that
our
guest
was
its
owner
vacant
it
was
now
and
looking
quite
as
if
the
bailiffs
had
been
in
he
couldn
t
cook
ham
and
eggs
proper
suggested
cousin
egbert
i
tried
him
three
times
and
every
time
he
done
something
french
to
em
that
nobody
had
ought
to
do
to
ham
and
hereupon
i
ventured
to
assert
that
a
nationalism
would
prove
the
ruin
of
any
chef
outside
his
own
country
there
must
be
a
certain
breadth
of
treatment
a
blending
of
the
best
features
of
different
schools
one
must
know
english
and
french
methods
and
yet
be
a
slave
to
neither
one
must
even
know
american
cookery
and
be
prepared
to
adapt
its
or
so
undoubted
excellencies
from
this
i
ventured
further
into
a
general
criticism
of
the
dinners
i
had
eaten
at
red
gap
s
smartest
houses
too
profuse
they
were
i
said
and
too
little
satisfying
in
any
one
feature
too
many
courses
constructed
as
i
had
observed
after
photographs
printed
in
the
back
pages
of
women
s
magazines
doubtless
they
possessed
a
certain
artistic
value
as
sights
for
the
eye
but
considered
as
food
they
were
devoid
of
any
inner
meaning
bill
s
right
said
cousin
egbert
warmly
mrs
effie
she
gets
up
about
nine
of
them
pictures
with
nuts
and
grated
eggs
and
scrambled
tomatoes
all
over
em
and
nobody
knowing
what
s
what
and
even
when
you
strike
one
that
tastes
good
they
s
only
a
dab
of
it
and
you
mustn
t
ask
for
any
more
when
i
go
out
to
dinner
what
i
want
is
to
have
em
say
pass
up
your
plate
floud
for
another
piece
of
the
steak
and
some
potatoes
and
have
some
more
squash
and
help
yourself
to
the
quince
that
s
how
it
had
ought
to
be
but
i
keep
eatin
these
here
little
plates
of
things
and
waiting
for
the
real
stuff
and
first
thing
i
know
i
get
a
spoonful
of
coffee
in
something
like
you
put
eye
medicine
into
and
i
know
it
s
all
over
last
time
i
was
out
i
hid
up
a
dish
of
these
here
salted
almuns
under
a
fern
and
et
the
whole
lot
from
time
to
time
kind
of
absent
like
it
helped
some
but
it
wasn
t
same
here
put
in
the
mixer
saturating
half
a
slice
of
bread
in
the
sauce
of
the
stew
i
can
t
afford
to
act
otherwise
than
like
i
am
a
lady
at
one
of
them
dinners
but
the
minute
i
m
home
i
beat
it
for
the
icebox
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
to
be
socially
elegant
but
we
hadn
t
ought
to
let
it
contaminate
our
food
none
and
even
at
that
new
york
hotel
this
summer
you
had
to
make
trouble
to
get
fed
proper
i
wanted
strawberry
shortcake
and
what
do
you
reckon
they
dealt
me
a
thing
looking
like
a
marble
palace
sponge
cake
and
whipped
cream
with
a
few
red
spots
in
between
well
long
as
we
re
friends
here
together
i
may
say
that
i
raised
hell
until
i
had
the
chef
himself
up
and
told
him
exactly
what
to
do
biscuit
dough
baked
and
prized
apart
and
buttered
strawberries
with
sugar
on
em
in
between
and
on
top
and
plenty
of
regular
cream
well
after
three
days
trying
he
finally
managed
to
get
simple
he
just
couldn
t
believe
i
meant
it
at
first
and
kept
building
on
the
whipped
cream
and
the
thing
cost
eight
dollars
but
you
can
bet
he
had
me
even
then
the
bonehead
smarty
had
sweetened
the
cream
and
grated
nutmeg
into
it
i
give
up
and
if
you
can
t
get
right
food
in
new
york
how
can
you
expect
to
here
and
jackson
the
idiot
has
just
fired
the
only
real
cook
in
red
gap
yes
sir
he
s
let
the
coons
go
it
come
out
that
waterman
had
sneaked
out
that
suit
of
his
golf
clothes
that
kate
kenner
wore
in
the
minstrel
show
so
he
fired
them
both
and
now
i
got
to
support
em
because
as
long
as
we
re
friends
here
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
i
egged
the
coon
on
to
do
i
saw
that
she
was
referring
to
the
black
and
his
wife
whom
i
had
met
at
the
new
york
camp
though
it
seemed
quaint
to
me
that
they
should
be
called
coons
which
is
i
take
it
a
diminutive
for
raccoon
a
species
of
ground
game
to
be
found
in
america
truth
to
tell
i
enjoyed
myself
immensely
at
this
simple
but
satisfying
meal
feeling
myself
one
with
these
homely
people
and
i
was
sorry
when
we
had
finished
that
was
some
little
dinner
itself
said
the
mixer
as
she
rolled
a
cigarette
and
now
you
boys
set
still
while
i
do
up
the
nor
would
she
allow
either
of
us
to
assist
her
in
this
work
when
she
had
done
cousin
egbert
proceeded
to
mix
hot
toddies
from
the
whiskey
and
we
gathered
about
the
table
before
the
open
fire
now
we
ll
have
a
nice
home
evening
said
the
mixer
and
to
my
great
embarrassment
she
began
at
once
to
speak
to
myself
a
strong
man
like
him
has
got
no
business
becoming
a
social
butterfly
she
remarked
to
cousin
egbert
oh
bill
s
all
right
insisted
the
latter
as
he
had
done
so
many
times
before
he
s
all
right
so
far
but
let
him
go
on
for
a
year
or
so
and
he
won
t
be
a
darned
bit
better
than
what
jackson
is
mark
my
words
just
a
social
butterfly
wearing
funny
clothes
and
attending
afternoon
well
i
don
t
say
you
ain
t
right
said
cousin
egbert
thoughtfully
that
s
one
reason
i
got
him
out
here
where
everything
is
nice
what
with
speaking
pieces
like
an
actor
i
was
afraid
they
d
have
him
making
more
kinds
of
a
fool
of
himself
than
what
jackson
does
him
being
a
foreigner
and
his
mind
kind
o
running
on
what
clothes
a
man
had
ought
to
hereupon
so
flushed
was
i
with
the
good
feeling
of
the
occasion
i
told
them
straight
that
i
had
resolved
to
quit
being
colonel
ruggles
of
the
british
army
and
associate
of
the
nobility
that
i
had
determined
to
forget
all
class
distinctions
and
to
become
one
of
themselves
plain
simple
and
unpretentious
it
is
true
that
i
had
consumed
two
of
the
hot
grogs
but
my
mind
was
clear
enough
and
both
my
companions
applauded
this
resolution
if
he
can
just
get
his
mind
off
clothes
for
a
bit
he
might
amount
to
something
said
cousin
egbert
and
it
will
scarcely
be
credited
but
at
the
moment
i
felt
actually
grateful
to
him
for
this
admission
we
ll
think
about
his
case
said
the
mixer
taking
her
own
second
toddy
whereupon
the
two
fell
to
talking
of
other
things
chiefly
of
their
cattle
plantations
and
the
price
of
which
then
seemed
to
be
six
and
one
half
though
what
this
meant
i
had
no
notion
also
i
gathered
that
the
mixer
at
her
own
had
been
watching
her
calves
marked
with
her
monogram
though
i
would
never
have
credited
her
with
so
much
sentiment
when
the
retiring
hour
came
cousin
egbert
and
i
prepared
to
take
our
blankets
outside
to
sleep
but
the
mixer
would
have
none
of
this
the
last
time
i
slept
in
here
she
remarked
mice
was
crawling
over
me
all
night
so
you
keep
your
shack
and
i
ll
bed
down
outside
i
ain
t
afraid
of
mice
understand
but
i
don
t
like
to
feel
their
feet
on
my
and
to
my
great
dismay
though
cousin
egbert
took
it
calmly
enough
she
took
a
roll
of
blankets
and
made
a
crude
pallet
on
the
ground
outside
under
a
spreading
pine
tree
i
take
it
she
was
that
sort
the
least
i
could
do
was
to
secure
two
tins
of
milk
from
our
larder
and
place
them
near
her
cot
in
case
of
some
lurking
though
i
said
nothing
of
this
not
wishing
to
alarm
her
needlessly
inside
the
hut
cousin
egbert
and
i
partook
of
a
final
toddy
before
retiring
he
was
unusually
thoughtful
and
i
had
difficulty
in
persuading
him
to
any
conversation
thus
having
noted
a
bearskin
before
my
bed
i
asked
him
if
he
had
killed
the
animal
no
said
he
shortly
i
wouldn
t
lie
for
a
bear
as
small
as
as
he
was
again
silent
i
made
no
further
approaches
to
him
from
my
first
sleep
i
was
awakened
by
a
long
booming
yell
from
our
guest
outside
cousin
egbert
and
i
reached
the
door
at
the
same
time
i
ve
got
it
bellowed
the
mixer
and
we
went
out
to
her
in
the
chill
night
she
sat
up
with
the
blankets
muffled
about
her
we
start
bill
in
that
restaurant
she
began
it
come
to
me
in
a
flash
i
judge
he
s
got
the
right
ideas
and
waterman
and
his
wife
can
cook
for
bully
exclaimed
cousin
egbert
i
was
thinking
he
ought
to
have
a
gents
furnishing
store
on
account
of
his
mind
running
to
dress
but
you
got
the
best
i
ll
stake
him
to
the
rent
she
put
in
and
i
ll
stake
him
to
the
rest
exclaimed
cousin
egbert
delightedly
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
suddenly
saw
myself
a
licensed
victualler
i
ll
call
it
the
united
states
grill
i
said
suddenly
as
if
by
inspiration
three
rousing
cheers
for
the
grill
shouted
cousin
egbert
to
the
surrounding
hills
and
repairing
to
the
hut
he
brought
out
hot
toddies
with
which
we
drank
success
to
the
new
enterprise
for
a
i
dare
say
we
discussed
details
there
in
the
cold
night
not
seeing
that
it
was
quite
preposterously
bizarre
returning
to
the
hut
at
last
cousin
egbert
declared
himself
so
chilled
that
he
must
have
another
toddy
before
retiring
and
although
i
was
already
feeling
myself
the
equal
of
any
american
i
consented
to
join
him
just
before
retiring
again
my
attention
centred
a
second
time
upon
the
bearskin
before
my
bed
and
forgetting
that
i
had
already
inquired
about
it
i
demanded
of
him
if
he
had
killed
the
animal
sure
said
he
killed
it
with
one
shot
just
as
it
was
going
to
claw
me
it
was
an
awful
big
morning
found
the
three
of
us
engrossed
with
the
new
plan
and
by
the
time
our
guest
rode
away
after
luncheon
the
thing
was
well
forward
and
i
had
the
mixer
s
order
upon
her
estate
agent
at
red
gap
for
admission
to
the
vacant
premises
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
between
games
of
cribbage
cousin
egbert
and
i
discussed
the
venture
and
it
was
now
that
i
began
to
foresee
a
certain
difficulty
how
i
asked
myself
would
the
going
into
trade
of
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
be
regarded
by
those
who
had
been
his
social
sponsors
in
red
gap
i
mean
to
say
would
not
effie
and
the
feel
that
i
had
played
them
false
had
i
not
given
them
the
right
to
believe
that
i
should
continue
during
my
stay
in
their
town
to
be
one
whom
their
county
families
would
consider
rather
a
personage
it
was
idle
indeed
for
me
to
deny
that
my
personality
as
well
as
my
assumed
origin
and
social
position
abroad
had
conferred
a
sort
of
prestige
upon
my
sponsors
that
on
my
account
in
short
the
north
side
set
had
been
newly
armed
in
its
battle
with
the
bohemian
set
and
they
relied
upon
my
continued
influence
how
then
could
i
face
them
with
the
declaration
that
i
meant
to
become
a
tradesman
should
i
be
doing
a
caddish
thing
i
wondered
putting
the
difficulty
to
cousin
egbert
he
dismissed
it
impatiently
by
saying
oh
shucks
in
truth
i
do
not
believe
he
comprehended
it
in
the
least
but
then
it
was
that
i
fell
upon
my
inspiration
i
might
take
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
from
the
north
side
set
but
i
would
give
them
another
and
bigger
notable
in
his
place
this
should
be
none
other
than
the
honourable
george
whom
i
would
now
summon
a
fortnight
before
i
had
received
a
rather
snarky
letter
from
him
demanding
to
know
how
long
i
meant
to
remain
in
north
america
and
disclosing
that
he
was
in
a
wretched
state
for
want
of
some
one
to
look
after
him
and
he
had
even
hinted
that
in
the
event
of
my
continued
absence
he
might
himself
come
out
to
america
and
fetch
me
back
his
quarter
s
allowance
would
i
knew
be
due
in
a
fortnight
and
my
letter
would
reach
him
therefore
before
some
adventurer
had
sold
him
a
system
for
beating
the
french
games
of
chance
and
my
letter
would
be
compelling
i
would
make
it
a
summons
he
could
not
resist
thus
when
i
met
the
reproachful
gaze
of
the
and
of
effie
i
should
be
able
to
tell
them
i
go
from
you
but
i
leave
you
a
better
man
in
my
with
the
honourable
george
augustus
next
earl
of
brinstead
as
their
house
guest
i
made
no
doubt
that
the
north
side
set
would
at
once
prevail
as
it
never
had
before
the
bohemian
set
losing
at
once
such
of
its
members
as
really
mattered
who
would
of
course
be
sensible
of
the
tremendous
social
importance
of
the
honourable
george
yet
there
came
moments
in
which
i
would
again
find
myself
in
no
end
of
a
funk
foreseeing
difficulties
of
an
insurmountable
character
at
such
times
cousin
egbert
strove
to
cheer
me
with
all
sorts
of
assurances
and
to
divert
my
mind
he
took
me
upon
excursions
of
the
roughest
sort
into
the
surrounding
jungle
in
search
either
of
fish
or
ground
game
after
three
days
of
this
my
became
almost
a
total
ruin
particularly
as
to
the
trousers
so
that
i
was
glad
to
borrow
a
pair
of
overalls
such
as
cousin
egbert
wore
they
were
a
tidy
fit
but
having
resolved
not
to
resist
america
any
longer
i
donned
them
without
even
removing
the
advertising
placard
with
my
stubble
of
beard
it
will
be
understood
that
i
now
appeared
as
one
of
their
hearty
western
americans
of
the
roughest
type
which
was
almost
quite
a
little
odd
considering
my
former
principles
cousin
egbert
i
need
hardly
say
was
immensely
pleased
with
my
changed
appearance
and
remarked
that
i
was
sure
a
live
he
also
heartened
me
in
the
matter
of
the
possible
disapproval
of
which
he
had
divined
was
the
essential
rabbit
in
my
moodiness
i
admit
the
guy
uses
beautiful
language
he
conceded
and
probably
he
s
in
education
but
jest
the
same
he
ain
t
the
whole
seven
pillars
of
the
house
of
wisdom
not
by
a
long
shot
if
he
gets
fancy
with
you
sock
him
again
you
done
it
so
far
was
the
worthy
fellow
from
divining
the
intimate
niceties
involved
in
my
giving
up
a
social
career
for
trade
nor
could
he
properly
estimate
the
importance
of
my
plan
to
summon
the
honourable
george
to
red
gap
merely
remarking
that
the
judge
was
all
right
and
a
good
mixer
and
that
the
boys
would
give
him
a
swell
time
our
return
journey
to
red
gap
was
made
in
company
with
the
indian
tuttle
and
the
two
hank
and
buck
all
of
whom
professed
themselves
glad
to
meet
me
again
and
they
too
were
wildly
enthusiastic
at
hearing
from
cousin
egbert
of
my
proposed
business
venture
needless
to
say
they
were
of
a
class
that
would
bother
itself
little
with
any
question
of
social
propriety
involved
in
my
entering
trade
and
they
were
loud
in
their
promises
of
future
patronage
at
this
i
again
felt
some
misgiving
for
i
meant
the
united
states
grill
to
possess
an
atmosphere
of
quiet
refinement
calculated
to
appeal
to
particular
people
that
really
mattered
and
yet
it
was
plain
that
keeping
a
public
house
i
must
be
prepared
to
entertain
agricultural
labourers
and
members
of
the
lower
or
working
classes
for
a
time
i
debated
having
an
ordinary
for
such
as
these
where
they
could
be
shut
away
from
my
selecter
patrons
but
eventually
decided
upon
a
tariff
that
would
be
prohibitive
to
all
but
desirable
people
the
rougher
or
bohemian
element
being
required
to
spring
an
extra
shilling
would
doubtless
seek
other
places
for
two
days
we
again
filed
through
mountain
gorges
of
a
most
awkward
character
reaching
red
gap
at
dusk
for
this
i
was
rather
grateful
not
only
because
of
my
beard
and
the
overalls
but
on
account
of
a
hat
of
the
most
shocking
description
which
cousin
egbert
had
pressed
upon
me
when
my
own
was
lost
in
a
glen
i
was
willing
to
roughen
it
in
all
with
these
worthy
americans
but
i
knew
that
to
those
who
had
remarked
my
careful
taste
in
dress
my
present
appearance
would
seem
almost
a
little
singular
i
would
rather
i
did
not
shock
them
to
this
extent
yet
when
our
animals
had
been
left
in
their
corral
or
rude
enclosure
i
found
it
would
be
ungracious
to
decline
the
hospitality
of
my
new
friends
who
wished
to
drink
to
the
success
of
the
grill
and
so
i
accompanied
them
to
several
public
houses
though
with
the
shocking
hat
pulled
well
down
over
my
face
also
as
the
dinner
hour
passed
i
consented
to
dine
with
them
at
the
establishment
of
a
chinese
where
we
sat
on
high
stools
at
a
counter
and
were
served
ham
and
eggs
and
some
of
the
simpler
american
foods
the
meal
being
over
i
knew
that
we
ought
to
cut
off
home
directly
but
cousin
egbert
again
insisted
upon
visiting
and
i
had
no
mind
to
leave
him
particularly
as
he
was
growing
more
and
more
bitter
in
my
behalf
against
i
had
a
doubtless
absurd
fear
that
he
would
seek
the
gentleman
out
and
do
him
a
mischief
though
for
the
moment
he
was
merely
urging
me
to
do
this
it
would
he
asserted
vastly
entertain
the
indian
tuttle
and
the
if
i
were
to
come
upon
and
savage
him
without
warning
or
at
least
with
only
a
paltry
excuse
which
he
seemed
proud
of
having
devised
you
go
up
to
the
guy
he
insisted
very
polite
you
understand
and
ask
him
what
day
this
is
if
he
says
it
s
tuesday
sock
but
it
is
tuesday
i
said
sure
he
replied
that
s
where
the
joke
comes
of
course
this
was
the
crudest
sort
of
american
humour
and
not
to
be
given
a
moment
s
serious
thought
so
i
redoubled
my
efforts
to
detach
him
from
our
honest
but
noisy
friends
and
presently
had
the
satisfaction
of
doing
so
by
pleading
that
i
must
be
up
early
on
the
morrow
and
would
also
require
his
assistance
at
parting
to
my
embarrassment
he
insisted
on
leading
the
group
in
a
cheer
what
s
the
matter
with
ruggles
they
loudly
demanded
in
unison
following
the
query
swiftly
with
he
s
all
right
the
he
being
eloquently
emphasized
but
at
last
we
were
away
from
them
and
off
into
the
darker
avenue
to
my
great
relief
remembering
my
garb
i
might
be
a
living
wire
as
cousin
egbert
had
said
but
i
was
keenly
aware
that
his
overalls
and
hat
would
rather
convey
the
impression
that
i
was
what
they
call
in
the
states
a
bad
person
from
a
bitter
creek
to
my
further
relief
the
floud
house
was
quite
dark
as
we
approached
and
let
ourselves
in
cousin
egbert
however
would
enter
the
flood
it
with
light
and
seat
himself
in
an
with
his
feet
lifted
to
a
sofa
he
then
raised
his
voice
in
a
ballad
of
an
infant
that
had
perished
rendering
it
most
tearfully
the
refrain
being
empty
is
the
cradle
baby
s
gone
apprehensive
at
this
i
stole
softly
up
the
stairs
and
had
but
reached
the
door
of
my
own
room
when
i
heard
effie
below
i
could
fancy
the
chilling
gaze
which
she
fastened
upon
the
singer
and
i
heard
her
coldly
demand
where
are
your
feet
whereupon
the
plaintive
voice
of
cousin
egbert
arose
to
me
just
below
my
i
mean
to
say
he
had
taken
the
thing
as
a
quiz
in
anatomy
rather
than
as
the
rebuke
it
was
meant
to
be
as
i
closed
my
door
i
heard
him
add
that
he
could
be
pushed
just
so
far
chapter
thirteen
having
written
and
posted
my
letter
to
the
honourable
george
the
following
morning
i
summoned
conceiving
it
my
first
duty
to
notify
him
and
effie
of
my
trade
intentions
i
also
requested
cousin
egbert
to
be
present
since
he
was
my
business
sponsor
all
being
gathered
at
the
floud
house
including
i
told
them
straight
that
i
had
resolved
to
abandon
my
social
career
brilliant
though
it
had
been
and
to
enter
trade
quite
as
one
of
their
americans
they
all
gasped
a
bit
at
my
first
words
as
i
had
quite
expected
them
to
do
but
what
was
my
surprise
when
i
went
on
to
announce
the
nature
of
my
enterprise
to
find
them
not
a
little
intrigued
by
it
and
to
discover
that
in
their
view
i
should
not
in
the
least
be
lowering
myself
capital
capital
exclaimed
and
the
ladies
emitted
little
exclamations
of
similar
import
at
last
said
we
shall
have
a
place
with
tone
to
it
the
hall
above
will
be
splendid
for
our
dinner
dances
and
now
we
can
have
smart
luncheons
and
afternoon
and
a
orchestra
and
suppers
said
effie
only
put
in
thoughtfully
he
will
of
course
be
compelled
to
use
discretion
about
his
patrons
the
rabble
of
course
he
broke
off
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
which
although
not
pointedly
seemed
to
indicate
cousin
egbert
who
once
more
wore
the
hunted
look
about
his
eyes
and
who
sat
by
uneasily
i
saw
him
wince
some
people
s
money
is
just
as
good
as
other
people
s
if
you
come
right
down
to
it
he
muttered
and
bill
is
out
for
the
coin
besides
we
all
got
to
eat
ain
t
we
smiled
deprecatingly
and
again
waved
his
hand
as
if
there
were
no
need
for
words
that
rowdy
bohemian
set
began
effie
but
i
made
bold
to
interrupt
there
might
i
said
be
awkward
moments
but
i
had
no
doubt
that
i
should
be
able
to
meet
them
with
a
flawless
tact
meantime
for
the
ultimate
confusion
of
the
bohemian
set
of
red
gap
i
had
to
announce
that
the
honourable
george
augustus
would
presently
be
with
us
with
him
as
a
member
of
the
north
side
set
i
pointed
out
it
was
not
possible
to
believe
that
any
desirable
members
of
the
bohemian
set
would
longer
refuse
to
affiliate
with
the
smartest
people
my
announcement
made
quite
all
the
sensation
i
had
anticipated
indeed
arose
quickly
and
grasped
me
by
the
hand
echoing
the
honourable
george
augustus
brother
of
the
earl
of
brinstead
with
little
shivers
of
ecstasy
in
his
voice
while
the
ladies
pealed
their
excitement
incoherently
with
really
really
and
actually
coming
to
red
gap
the
brother
of
a
lord
then
almost
at
once
i
detected
curiously
cold
glances
being
darted
at
each
other
by
the
ladies
of
course
we
will
be
only
too
glad
to
put
him
up
said
quickly
but
my
dear
he
will
of
course
come
to
us
first
put
in
effie
afterward
to
be
sure
it
s
so
important
that
he
should
receive
a
favourable
impression
responded
that
s
exactly
why
effie
came
back
with
not
a
little
obvious
warmth
here
caught
my
eye
i
dare
say
ruggles
and
i
can
be
depended
upon
to
decide
a
minor
matter
like
that
he
said
the
ladies
both
broke
in
at
this
rather
sputteringly
but
cousin
egbert
silenced
them
shake
dice
for
him
he
said
poker
dice
three
throws
aces
how
shockingly
vulgar
hissed
even
if
there
were
no
other
reason
for
his
coming
to
us
remarked
her
husband
coldly
there
are
certain
unfortunate
associations
which
ought
to
make
his
entertainment
here
quite
if
you
re
calling
me
unfortunate
associations
remarked
cousin
egbert
you
want
to
get
it
out
of
your
head
right
off
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
the
judge
and
i
get
along
fine
together
i
told
him
when
i
was
in
paris
and
europe
to
look
me
up
the
first
thing
if
ever
he
come
here
and
he
said
he
sure
would
the
judge
is
some
mixer
believe
me
the
judge
echoed
the
in
deep
disgust
you
come
right
down
to
it
i
bet
a
cookie
he
stays
just
where
i
tell
him
to
stay
insisted
cousin
egbert
the
evident
conviction
of
his
tone
alarmed
his
hearers
who
regarded
each
other
with
pained
speculation
right
where
i
tell
him
to
stay
and
no
place
else
insisted
cousin
egbert
sensing
the
impression
he
had
made
but
this
is
too
monstrous
said
jackson
regarding
me
imploringly
the
honourable
george
i
admitted
has
been
known
to
do
unexpected
things
and
there
have
been
times
when
he
was
not
as
sensitive
as
i
could
wish
to
the
demands
of
his
caste
bill
is
stalling
he
knows
darned
well
the
judge
is
a
mixer
broke
in
cousin
egbert
somewhat
to
my
embarrassment
nor
did
any
reply
occur
to
me
there
was
a
moment
s
awkward
silence
during
which
i
became
sensitive
to
a
radical
change
in
the
attitude
which
these
people
bore
to
cousin
egbert
they
shot
him
looks
of
furtive
but
unmistakable
respect
and
effie
remarked
almost
with
tenderness
we
must
admit
that
cousin
egbert
has
a
certain
way
with
i
dare
say
floud
and
i
can
adjust
the
matter
satisfactorily
to
all
remarked
and
with
a
jaunty
affection
of
he
opened
his
cigarette
case
to
cousin
egbert
i
ain
t
made
up
my
mind
yet
where
i
ll
have
him
stay
announced
the
latter
too
evidently
feeling
his
newly
acquired
importance
i
may
have
him
stay
one
place
then
again
i
may
have
him
stay
another
i
can
t
decide
things
like
that
and
here
the
matter
was
preposterously
left
the
aspirants
for
this
social
honour
patiently
bending
their
knees
to
the
erstwhile
despised
cousin
egbert
and
the
latter
being
visibly
puffed
up
by
rather
awkward
stages
they
came
again
to
a
discussion
of
the
united
states
grill
the
name
of
course
might
be
thought
flamboyant
suggested
delicately
but
i
have
determined
i
said
no
longer
to
resist
america
and
so
i
can
think
of
no
name
more
your
determination
he
answered
bears
rather
sinister
implications
one
may
be
vanquished
by
america
as
i
have
been
one
may
even
submit
but
surely
one
may
always
resist
a
little
may
not
one
one
need
not
abjectly
surrender
one
s
finest
convictions
need
one
oh
shucks
put
in
cousin
egbert
petulantly
what
s
the
use
of
all
that
one
stuff
bill
wants
a
good
american
name
for
his
place
me
i
first
thought
the
bon
ton
eating
house
would
be
kind
of
a
nice
name
for
it
but
as
soon
as
he
said
the
united
states
grill
i
knew
it
was
a
better
one
it
sounds
kind
of
grand
and
here
made
deprecating
clucks
but
not
too
directly
toward
cousin
egbert
and
my
choice
of
a
name
was
not
further
criticised
i
went
on
to
assure
them
that
i
should
have
an
establishment
quietly
smart
rather
than
noisily
elegant
and
that
i
made
no
doubt
the
place
would
give
a
new
tone
to
red
gap
whereat
they
all
expressed
themselves
as
immensely
pleased
and
our
little
conference
came
to
an
end
in
company
with
cousin
egbert
i
now
went
to
examine
the
premises
i
was
to
take
over
there
was
a
spacious
corner
room
lighted
from
the
front
and
side
which
would
adapt
itself
well
to
the
decorative
scheme
i
had
in
mind
the
kitchen
with
its
ranges
i
found
would
be
almost
quite
suitable
for
my
purpose
requiring
but
little
alteration
but
the
large
room
was
of
course
atrociously
impossible
in
the
american
fashion
with
unsightly
walls
the
floors
covered
with
american
cloth
of
a
garish
pattern
and
the
small
oblong
tables
and
flimsy
chairs
vastly
uninviting
as
to
the
gross
ideals
of
the
former
tenant
i
need
only
say
that
he
had
made
as
i
now
learned
a
window
display
of
foods
quite
after
the
manner
of
a
draper
s
window
moulds
of
custard
set
in
a
row
flanked
on
either
side
by
pies
as
the
natives
call
their
tarts
with
perhaps
a
roast
fowl
or
ham
in
the
centre
artistic
vulgarity
could
of
course
go
little
beyond
this
but
almost
as
offensive
were
the
abundant
pathetically
remaining
in
place
coffee
like
mother
used
to
make
read
one
impertinently
intimate
this
professing
a
familiarity
with
one
s
people
that
would
never
do
with
us
try
our
boston
baked
beans
pleaded
another
quite
abjectly
and
several
others
quite
indelicately
stated
the
prices
at
which
different
dishes
might
be
had
irish
stew
cents
philadelphia
capon
cents
fried
chicken
maryland
cents
new
york
fancy
broil
indeed
the
poor
chap
seemed
to
have
been
possessed
by
a
geographical
mania
finding
it
difficult
to
submit
the
simplest
viands
without
crediting
them
to
distant
towns
or
provinces
upon
cousin
egbert
s
remarking
that
these
bedizened
placards
would
come
in
handy
i
took
pains
to
explain
to
him
just
how
different
the
united
states
grill
would
be
the
walls
would
be
done
in
deep
red
the
floor
would
be
covered
with
a
heavy
turkey
carpet
of
the
same
tone
the
present
crude
electric
lighting
fixtures
must
be
replaced
with
indirect
lighting
from
the
ceiling
and
electric
candlesticks
for
the
tables
the
latter
would
be
massive
and
of
stained
oak
my
general
being
red
and
brown
the
chairs
would
be
of
the
same
style
comfortable
chairs
in
which
patrons
would
be
tempted
to
linger
the
windows
would
be
heavily
draped
in
a
word
the
place
would
have
atmosphere
not
the
loud
and
blaring
elegance
which
i
had
observed
in
the
smartest
of
new
york
establishments
with
shrieking
decorations
and
tables
jammed
together
but
an
atmosphere
of
distinction
which
though
subtle
would
yet
impress
and
hodmen
carters
in
short
the
native
cousin
egbert
i
fear
was
not
properly
impressed
with
my
plan
for
he
looked
longingly
at
the
yet
he
made
the
most
loyal
pretence
to
this
effect
even
when
i
explained
further
that
i
should
probably
have
no
printed
menu
which
i
have
always
regarded
as
the
ultimate
vulgarity
in
a
place
where
there
are
any
proper
relations
between
patrons
and
steward
he
made
one
wistful
timid
reference
to
the
try
our
merchant
s
lunch
for
cents
after
which
he
gave
in
entirely
particularly
when
i
explained
that
ham
and
eggs
in
the
best
manner
would
be
forthcoming
at
his
order
even
though
no
placard
vaunted
them
or
named
their
price
advertising
one
s
ability
to
serve
ham
and
eggs
i
pointed
out
to
him
would
be
quite
like
advertising
that
one
was
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
after
this
he
meekly
enough
accompanied
me
to
his
bank
where
he
placed
a
thousand
pounds
to
my
credit
adding
that
i
could
go
as
much
farther
as
i
liked
whereupon
i
set
in
motion
the
machinery
for
decorating
and
furnishing
the
place
with
particular
attention
to
silver
linen
china
and
glassware
all
of
which
i
was
resolved
should
have
an
air
of
its
own
nor
did
i
neglect
to
seek
out
the
pair
of
blacks
and
enter
into
an
agreement
with
them
to
assist
in
staffing
my
place
i
had
feared
that
the
male
black
might
have
resolved
to
return
to
his
adventurous
life
of
outlawry
after
leaving
the
employment
of
but
i
found
him
peacefully
inclined
and
entirely
willing
to
accept
service
with
me
while
his
wife
upon
whom
i
would
depend
for
much
of
the
actual
cooking
was
wholly
enthusiastic
admiring
especially
my
of
reds
i
observed
at
once
that
her
almost
exclusive
notion
of
preparing
food
was
to
fry
it
but
i
made
no
doubt
that
i
would
be
able
to
broaden
her
scope
since
there
are
of
course
things
that
one
simply
does
not
fry
the
male
black
or
raccoon
at
first
alarmed
me
not
a
little
by
reason
of
threats
he
made
against
on
account
of
having
been
shopped
he
nursed
an
intention
so
he
informed
me
of
putting
in
the
boots
of
his
late
employer
and
so
bringing
evil
upon
him
either
by
disease
or
violence
but
in
this
i
discouraged
him
smartly
apprising
him
that
the
would
doubtless
be
among
our
most
desirable
patrons
whereupon
his
wife
promised
for
him
that
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
was
a
native
of
formidable
bulk
and
her
menacing
glare
at
her
consort
as
she
made
this
promise
gave
me
instant
confidence
in
her
power
to
control
him
desperate
fellow
though
he
was
later
in
the
day
at
the
door
of
the
silversmith
s
cousin
egbert
hailed
the
pressman
i
had
met
on
the
evening
of
my
arrival
and
insisted
that
i
impart
to
him
the
details
of
my
venture
the
chap
seemed
vastly
interested
and
his
sheet
the
following
morning
published
the
following
the
delmonico
of
the
west
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
of
london
and
paris
for
the
past
two
months
a
social
favourite
in
red
gap
s
select
north
side
set
has
decided
to
cast
his
lot
among
us
and
will
henceforth
be
reckoned
as
one
of
our
leading
business
men
the
plan
of
the
colonel
is
nothing
less
than
to
give
red
gap
a
truly
√©lite
and
recherch√©
restaurant
after
the
best
models
of
london
and
paris
to
which
purpose
he
will
devote
a
considerable
portion
of
his
ample
means
the
establishment
will
occupy
the
roomy
corner
store
of
the
pettengill
block
and
orders
have
already
been
placed
for
its
decoration
and
furnishing
which
will
be
sumptuous
beyond
anything
yet
seen
in
our
thriving
metropolis
in
speaking
of
his
enterprise
yesterday
the
colonel
remarked
with
a
sly
twinkle
in
his
eye
demosthenes
was
the
son
of
a
cutler
cromwell

a

i
trust
that
in
this

of

it
will
not

my

to

of
a
restaurant
that
will
be
a
credit
to
the
fastest
growing
town
in
the
state
you
americans
have
continued
the
colonel
in
his
dry
inimitable
manner
a
bewildering
variety
of
foodstuffs
but
i
trust
i
may
be
forgiven
for
saying
that
you
have
used
too
little
constructive
imagination
in
the
cooking
of
it
in
the
one
matter
of
tea
for
example
i
have
been
obliged
to
figure
in
some
episodes
that
were
profoundly
regrettable
again
amid
the
profusion
of
fresh
vegetables
and
meats
you
are
becoming
a
nation
of
tinned
food
eaters
or
canned
food
as
you
prefer
to
call
it
this
i
need
hardly
say
adds
to
your
cost
of
living
and
also
makes
you
liable
to
one
of
the
most
dreaded
of
modern
diseases
a
disease
whose
rise
can
be
traced
to
the
rise
of
the
industry
your
tin
openers
rasp
into
the
tin
with
the
result
that
a
fine
sawdust
of
metal
must
drop
into
the
contents
and
so
enter
the
human
system
the
result
is
perhaps
negligible
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
but
that
it
is
not
universally
so
is
proved
by
the
prevalence
of
appendicitis
not
orange
or
grape
pips
as
was
so
long
believed
but
the
deadly
fine
rain
of
metal
shavings
must
be
held
responsible
for
this
scourge
i
need
hardly
say
that
at
the
united
states
grill
no
tinned
food
will
be
this
latest
discovery
of
the
colonel
s
is
important
if
true
be
that
as
it
may
his
restaurant
will
fill
a
want
and
will
doubtless
prove
to
be
an
important
factor
in
the
social
gayeties
of
our
smart
set
due
notice
of
its
opening
will
be
given
in
the
news
and
doubtless
in
the
advertising
columns
of
this
journal
again
i
was
brought
to
marvel
at
a
peculiarity
of
the
american
press
a
certain
childish
eagerness
for
marvels
and
grotesque
wonders
i
had
given
but
passing
thought
to
my
remarks
about
appendicitis
and
its
relation
to
the
american
habit
nor
on
reading
the
chap
s
screed
did
they
impress
me
as
being
fraught
with
vital
interest
to
thinking
people
in
truth
i
was
more
concerned
with
the
comparison
of
myself
to
a
restaurateur
of
the
crude
new
city
of
new
york
which
might
belittle
rather
than
distinguish
me
i
suspected
but
what
was
my
astonishment
to
perceive
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
that
i
had
created
rather
a
sensation
with
attending
newspaper
publicity
which
although
bizarre
enough
i
am
bound
to
say
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
consideration
in
which
i
afterward
came
to
be
held
by
the
more
persons
of
red
gap
busied
with
the
multitude
of
details
attending
my
installation
i
was
called
upon
by
another
press
chap
representing
a
spokane
sheet
who
wished
me
to
elaborate
my
views
concerning
the
most
probable
cause
of
appendicitis
which
i
found
myself
able
to
do
with
some
eloquence
reciting
among
other
details
that
even
though
the
metal
dust
might
be
of
an
almost
microscopic
fineness
it
could
still
do
a
mischief
to
one
s
appendix
the
press
chap
appeared
wholly
receptive
to
my
views
and
after
securing
details
of
my
plan
to
smarten
red
gap
with
a
restaurant
of
real
distinction
he
asked
so
civilly
for
a
photographic
portrait
of
myself
that
i
was
unable
to
refuse
him
the
thing
was
a
snap
taken
of
me
one
morning
at
by
higgins
the
butler
as
i
stood
by
his
lordship
s
saddle
mare
it
was
not
by
any
means
the
best
likeness
i
have
had
but
there
was
a
rather
effective
bit
of
background
disclosing
the
driveway
and
the
fa√ßade
of
the
east
wing
this
episode
i
had
forgotten
when
on
the
following
sunday
i
found
the
thing
emblazoned
across
a
page
of
the
spokane
sheet
under
a
shrieking
headline
can
opener
blamed
for
a
secondary
heading
ran
famous
british
sportsman
and
bon
vivant
advances
novel
accompanying
this
was
a
print
of
the
photograph
entitled
colonel
marmaduke
ruggles
with
his
favourite
hunter
at
his
english
country
although
the
article
made
suitable
reference
to
myself
and
my
enterprise
it
was
devoted
chiefly
to
a
discussion
of
my
theory
and
was
supplemented
by
a
rather
snarky
statement
signed
by
a
physician
declaring
it
to
be
nonsense
i
thought
the
fellow
might
have
chosen
his
words
with
more
care
but
again
dismissed
the
matter
from
my
mind
yet
this
was
not
to
be
the
last
of
it
in
due
time
came
a
new
york
sheet
with
a
most
extraordinary
page
titled
englishman
learns
cause
of
appendicitis
read
the
heading
in
large
muddy
type
below
was
the
photograph
of
myself
now
entitled
sir
marmaduke
ruggles
and
his
favourite
but
this
was
only
one
of
the
illustrations
from
the
upper
corner
a
gigantic
hand
wielding
a
rained
a
voluminous
spray
of
metal
presumably
upon
a
cowering
wretch
in
the
lower
corner
who
was
quite
plainly
all
in
there
were
tables
of
statistics
showing
the
increase
side
by
side
of
appendicitis
and
the
industry
a
matter
to
which
i
had
devoted
said
the
print
years
of
research
before
announcing
my
discovery
followed
statements
from
half
a
dozen
distinguished
surgeons
each
signed
autographically
all
but
one
rather
bluntly
disagreeing
with
me
insisting
that
the
cuts
cleanly
and
if
not
man
s
best
friend
should
at
least
be
considered
one
of
the
triumphs
of
civilization
the
only
exception
announced
that
he
was
at
present
conducting
laboratory
experiments
with
a
view
to
testing
my
theory
and
would
disclose
his
results
in
due
time
meantime
he
counselled
the
public
to
be
not
unduly
alarmed
of
the
further
flood
of
these
screeds
which
continued
for
the
better
part
of
a
year
i
need
not
speak
they
ran
the
gamut
from
serious
leaders
in
medical
journals
to
paid
ridicule
of
my
theory
in
advertisements
printed
by
the
persons
and
i
have
to
admit
that
in
the
end
the
public
returned
to
a
full
confidence
in
its
tinned
foods
but
that
is
beside
the
point
which
was
that
red
gap
had
become
intensely
interested
in
the
united
states
grill
and
to
this
i
was
not
averse
though
i
would
rather
i
had
been
regarded
as
one
of
their
plain
common
sort
instead
of
the
fictitious
colonel
which
cousin
egbert
s
stupidity
had
foisted
upon
the
town
the
sir
marmaduke
ruggles
and
his
favourite
hunter
had
been
especially
repugnant
to
my
finer
taste
particularly
as
it
was
seized
upon
by
the
cheap
fellow
hobbs
for
some
of
his
coarsest
humour
he
more
than
once
referring
to
that
detestable
cur
of
judson
s
who
had
quickly
resumed
his
allegiance
to
me
as
my
hunting
the
other
tradesmen
of
the
town
i
am
bound
to
say
exhibited
a
friendly
interest
in
my
venture
which
was
always
welcome
and
often
helpful
even
one
of
my
competitors
showed
himself
to
be
a
dead
sport
by
coming
to
me
from
time
to
time
with
hints
and
advice
he
was
an
entirely
worthy
person
who
advertised
his
restaurant
as
bert
s
go
to
bert
s
place
for
a
square
meal
was
his
favoured
line
in
the
public
prints
he
also
i
regret
to
say
made
a
practice
of
displaying
cooked
foods
in
his
the
window
carrying
the
line
in
enamelled
letters
tables
reserved
for
of
course
between
such
an
establishment
and
my
own
there
could
be
little
in
common
and
i
was
obliged
to
reject
a
placard
which
he
offered
me
reading
no
checks
cashed
this
means
you
although
he
and
cousin
egbert
warmly
advised
that
i
display
it
in
a
conspicuous
place
some
of
them
dead
beats
in
the
north
side
set
will
put
you
sideways
if
you
don
t
warned
the
latter
but
i
held
firmly
to
the
line
of
quiet
refinement
which
i
had
laid
down
and
explained
that
i
could
allow
no
such
inconsiderate
mention
of
money
to
be
obtruded
upon
the
notice
of
my
guests
i
would
devise
some
subtler
protection
against
the
dead
in
the
matter
of
music
however
i
was
pleased
to
accept
the
advice
of
cousin
egbert
get
one
of
them
musical
pianos
that
you
put
a
nickel
in
he
counselled
me
and
this
i
did
together
with
an
assorted
repertoire
of
selections
both
classical
and
popular
the
latter
consisting
chiefly
of
the
ragging
time
songs
to
which
the
native
americans
perform
their
folkdances
and
now
as
the
date
of
my
opening
drew
near
i
began
to
suspect
that
its
social
values
might
become
a
bit
complicated
for
example
approached
me
in
confidence
to
know
if
she
might
reserve
all
the
tables
in
my
establishment
for
the
opening
evening
remarking
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
put
the
correct
social
cachet
upon
the
place
at
once
which
would
be
achieved
by
her
inviting
only
the
desirable
people
though
she
was
all
for
settling
the
matter
at
once
something
prompted
me
to
take
it
under
consideration
the
same
evening
effie
approached
me
with
a
similar
suggestion
remarking
that
she
would
gladly
take
it
upon
herself
to
see
that
the
occasion
was
unmarred
by
the
presence
of
those
one
would
not
care
to
meet
in
one
s
own
home
again
i
was
somewhat
to
her
annoyance
the
following
morning
i
was
sought
by
judge
ballard
with
the
information
that
much
would
depend
upon
my
opening
and
if
the
matter
were
left
entirely
in
her
hands
she
would
be
more
than
glad
to
insure
its
success
of
her
also
i
begged
a
day
s
consideration
suspecting
then
that
i
might
be
compelled
to
ask
these
three
social
leaders
to
unite
amicably
as
patronesses
of
an
affair
that
was
bound
to
have
a
supreme
social
significance
but
as
i
still
meditated
profoundly
over
the
complication
late
that
afternoon
overlooking
in
the
meanwhile
an
electrician
who
was
busy
with
my
shaded
candlesticks
i
was
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
the
leader
of
the
bohemian
set
the
klondike
person
of
whom
i
have
spoken
again
i
was
compelled
to
observe
that
she
was
quite
the
most
smartly
gowned
woman
in
red
gap
and
that
she
marvellously
knew
what
to
put
on
her
head
she
coolly
surveyed
my
decorations
and
such
of
the
furnishings
as
were
in
place
before
addressing
me
i
wish
to
engage
one
of
your
best
tables
she
began
for
your
opening
night
the
tenth
isn
t
it
this
large
one
in
the
corner
will
do
nicely
there
will
be
eight
of
us
your
place
really
won
t
be
half
bad
if
your
food
is
at
all
the
creature
spoke
with
a
sublime
effrontery
quite
as
if
she
had
not
helped
a
few
weeks
before
to
ridicule
all
that
was
best
in
red
gap
society
yet
there
was
that
about
her
which
prevented
me
from
rebuking
her
even
by
the
faintest
shade
in
my
manner
more
than
this
i
suddenly
saw
that
the
bohemian
set
would
be
a
factor
in
my
trade
which
i
could
not
afford
to
ignore
while
i
affected
to
consider
her
request
she
tapped
the
toe
of
a
small
boot
with
a
correctly
rolled
umbrella
lifting
her
chin
rather
attractively
meanwhile
to
survey
my
freshly
done
ceiling
i
may
say
here
that
the
effect
of
her
was
most
compelling
and
i
could
well
understand
the
bitterness
with
which
the
ladies
of
the
onwards
and
upwards
society
had
gossiped
her
to
rags
incidently
this
was
the
first
correctly
rolled
umbrella
saving
my
own
that
i
had
seen
in
north
america
i
shall
be
pleased
i
said
to
reserve
this
table
for
you
eight
places
i
believe
you
said
she
left
me
as
a
duchess
might
have
she
was
that
sort
i
felt
almost
quite
unequal
to
her
and
the
die
was
cast
i
faced
each
of
the
three
ladies
who
had
previously
approached
me
with
the
declaration
that
i
was
a
licensed
victualler
bound
to
serve
all
who
might
apply
that
while
i
was
keenly
sensitive
to
the
social
aspects
of
my
business
it
was
yet
a
business
and
i
must
therefore
be
in
supreme
control
in
justice
to
myself
i
could
not
exclusively
entertain
any
faction
of
the
north
side
set
nor
even
the
set
in
its
entirety
in
each
instance
i
added
that
i
could
not
debar
from
my
tables
even
such
members
of
the
bohemian
set
as
conducted
themselves
in
a
seemly
manner
it
was
a
difficult
situation
calling
out
all
my
tact
yet
i
faced
it
with
a
firmness
which
was
later
to
react
to
my
advantage
in
ways
i
did
not
yet
dream
of
so
engrossed
for
a
month
had
i
been
with
furnishers
decorators
char
persons
and
others
that
the
time
of
the
honourable
george
s
arrival
drew
on
quite
before
i
realized
it
a
brief
and
still
snarky
note
had
apprised
me
of
his
intention
to
come
out
to
north
america
whereupon
i
had
all
but
forgotten
him
until
a
telegram
from
chicago
or
one
of
those
places
had
warned
me
of
his
imminence
this
i
displayed
to
cousin
egbert
who
much
pleased
with
himself
declared
that
the
honourable
george
should
be
taken
to
the
floud
home
directly
upon
his
arrival
i
meant
to
rope
him
in
there
on
the
start
he
confided
to
me
but
i
let
on
i
wasn
t
decided
yet
just
to
keep
em
stirred
up
effie
she
butters
me
up
with
soft
words
every
day
of
my
life
and
that
jackson
lad
has
offered
me
about
ten
thousand
of
them
vegetable
cigarettes
but
i
ll
have
to
throw
him
down
he
s
the
human
flivver
put
him
in
a
car
of
dressed
beef
and
he
d
freeze
it
between
here
and
spokane
yes
sir
you
could
cut
his
ear
off
and
it
wouldn
t
bleed
i
ain
t
going
to
run
the
judge
against
no
such
proposition
like
of
course
the
poor
chap
was
speaking
his
own
backwoods
metaphor
as
i
am
quite
sure
he
would
have
been
incapable
of
mutilating
or
even
of
imprisoning
him
in
a
goods
van
of
beef
i
mean
to
say
it
was
merely
his
way
of
speaking
and
was
not
to
be
taken
at
all
literally
as
a
result
of
his
ensuing
call
upon
the
pressman
the
sheet
of
the
following
morning
contained
word
of
the
honourable
george
s
coming
the
facts
being
not
garbled
more
than
was
usual
with
this
chap
red
gap
s
notable
guest
en
route
for
our
thriving
metropolis
is
a
personage
no
less
distinguished
than
the
honourable
george
augustus
only
brother
and
next
in
line
of
succession
to
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
the
british
peer
of
london
england
our
noble
visitor
will
be
the
house
guest
of
senator
and
floud
at
their
palatial
residence
on
ophir
avenue
where
he
will
be
extensively
entertained
particularly
by
our
esteemed
egbert
floud
with
whom
he
recently
hobnobbed
during
the
latter
s
stay
in
paris
france
his
advent
will
doubtless
prelude
a
season
of
unparalleled
gayety
particularly
as
egbert
floud
assures
us
that
the
judge
as
he
affectionately
calls
him
is
sure
some
if
this
be
true
the
gentleman
has
selected
a
community
where
his
talent
will
find
ample
scope
and
we
bespeak
for
his
lordship
a
hearty
welcome
chapter
fourteen
i
must
do
cousin
egbert
the
justice
to
say
that
he
showed
a
due
sense
of
his
responsibility
in
meeting
the
honourable
george
by
general
consent
the
honour
had
seemed
to
fall
to
him
both
the
and
effie
rather
timidly
conceding
his
claim
that
the
distinguished
guest
would
prefer
it
so
indeed
cousin
egbert
had
been
loudly
arrogant
in
the
matter
speaking
largely
of
his
european
intimacy
with
the
judge
until
as
he
confided
to
me
he
had
them
all
bisoned
or
i
believe
buffaloed
is
the
term
he
used
referring
to
the
animal
that
has
been
swept
from
the
american
savannahs
at
all
events
no
one
further
questioned
his
right
to
be
at
the
station
when
the
honourable
george
arrived
and
for
the
first
time
almost
since
his
own
homecoming
he
got
himself
up
with
some
attention
to
detail
if
left
to
himself
i
dare
say
he
would
have
donned
and
but
at
my
suggestion
he
chose
his
smartest
and
i
took
pains
to
see
that
the
minor
details
of
hat
boots
hose
gloves
were
studiously
correct
without
being
at
all
assertive
for
my
own
part
i
was
also
at
some
pains
with
my
attire
going
consciously
a
bit
further
with
details
than
cousin
egbert
thinking
it
best
the
honourable
george
should
at
once
observe
a
change
in
my
bearing
and
social
consequence
so
that
nothing
in
his
manner
toward
me
might
embarrassingly
publish
our
former
relations
the
stick
gloves
and
monocle
would
achieve
this
for
the
moment
and
once
alone
i
meant
to
tell
him
straight
that
all
was
over
between
us
as
master
and
man
we
having
passed
out
of
each
other
s
lives
in
that
respect
if
necessary
i
meant
to
read
to
him
certain
passages
from
the
declaration
of
independence
and
to
show
him
the
fateful
little
card
i
had
found
which
would
acquaint
him
i
made
no
doubt
with
the
great
change
that
had
come
upon
me
after
which
our
intimacy
would
rest
solely
upon
the
mutual
esteem
which
i
knew
to
exist
between
us
i
mean
to
say
it
would
never
have
done
for
one
moment
at
home
but
finding
ourselves
together
in
this
wild
and
lawless
country
we
would
neither
of
us
try
to
resist
america
but
face
each
other
as
one
equal
native
to
another
waiting
on
the
station
platform
with
cousin
egbert
he
confided
to
the
loungers
there
that
he
was
come
to
meet
his
friend
judge
basingwell
whereat
all
betrayed
a
friendly
interest
though
they
were
not
at
all
persons
that
mattered
being
of
the
class
who
each
day
went
down
as
they
put
it
to
see
number
six
go
there
was
thus
a
rather
tense
air
of
expectancy
when
the
train
pulled
in
from
one
of
the
pullman
night
coaches
emerged
the
honourable
george
preceded
by
a
blackamoor
or
raccoon
bearing
bags
and
bundles
and
followed
by
another
uniformed
raccoon
and
a
white
guard
also
bearing
bags
and
bundles
and
all
betraying
a
marked
anxiety
one
glance
at
the
honourable
george
served
to
confirm
certain
fears
i
had
suffered
regarding
his
appearance
topped
by
a
cap
in
an
inferior
state
of
preservation
he
wore
the
jacket
of
a
once
possible
doubtless
but
now
demoded
and
a
blazered
golfing
waistcoat
striking
for
its
poisonous
greens
trousers
from
an
outing
suit
that
i
myself
had
discarded
after
it
came
to
me
and
boots
of
an
entirely
shocking
character
of
his
cravat
i
have
not
the
heart
to
speak
but
i
may
mention
that
all
his
garments
were
quite
horrid
with
wrinkles
and
seemed
to
have
been
slept
in
repeatedly
cousin
egbert
at
once
rushed
forward
to
greet
his
guest
while
i
busied
myself
in
receiving
the
wishing
to
have
our
guest
effaced
from
the
scene
and
secluded
with
all
possible
speed
there
were
three
battered
handbags
two
rolls
of
travelling
rugs
a
a
a
pair
of
binoculars
a
a
a
a
portfolio
of
correspondence
materials
a
camera
a
some
of
these
lacking
either
strap
or
handle
the
attendants
all
emitted
hearty
sighs
of
relief
when
these
articles
had
been
deposited
upon
the
platform
without
being
told
i
divined
that
the
honourable
george
had
greatly
worried
them
during
the
long
journey
with
his
fretful
demands
for
service
and
i
tipped
them
handsomely
while
he
was
still
engaged
with
cousin
egbert
and
the
latter
s
friends
to
whom
he
was
being
presented
at
last
observing
me
he
came
forward
but
halted
on
surveying
the
luggage
and
screamed
hoarsely
to
the
last
attendant
who
was
now
boarding
the
train
the
latter
vanished
but
reappeared
as
the
train
moved
off
with
two
more
articles
a
vacuum
and
a
tin
of
charcoal
biscuits
the
absence
of
which
had
been
swiftly
detected
by
their
owner
it
was
at
that
moment
that
one
of
the
loungers
nearby
made
a
peculiar
observation
gee
said
he
to
a
native
beside
him
it
must
take
an
awful
lot
of
trouble
to
be
an
at
the
moment
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
pregnant
with
meaning
though
doubtless
it
was
because
i
had
so
long
been
a
resident
of
the
north
american
wilds
again
the
honourable
george
approached
me
and
grasped
my
hand
before
certain
details
of
my
attire
and
i
fancy
a
certain
change
in
my
bearing
attracted
his
notice
perhaps
it
was
the
single
glass
his
grasp
of
my
hand
relaxed
and
he
rubbed
his
eyes
as
if
dazed
from
a
blow
but
i
was
able
to
carry
the
situation
off
quite
nicely
under
cover
of
the
confusion
attending
his
many
bags
and
bundles
being
helped
also
at
the
moment
by
the
deeply
humiliating
discovery
of
a
certain
omission
from
his
attire
i
could
not
at
first
believe
my
eyes
and
was
obliged
to
look
again
and
again
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
honourable
george
was
wearing
a
single
spat
i
cried
out
at
this
pointing
i
fancy
in
a
most
undignified
manner
so
terrific
had
been
the
shock
of
it
and
what
was
my
amazement
to
hear
him
say
but
i
only
one
you
silly
how
could
i
wear
em
both
when
the
other
was
lost
in
that
bally
they
put
me
in
on
shipboard
no
bigger
than
a
and
he
had
too
plainly
crossed
north
america
in
this
shocking
state
glad
i
was
then
that
was
not
present
the
others
i
dare
say
considered
it
a
mere
freak
of
fashion
as
quickly
as
i
could
i
hustled
him
into
the
waiting
carriage
piling
his
luggage
about
him
to
the
best
advantage
and
hurrying
cousin
egbert
after
him
as
rapidly
as
i
could
though
the
latter
as
on
the
occasion
of
my
own
arrival
halted
our
departure
long
enough
to
present
the
honourable
george
to
the
driver
judge
shake
hands
with
my
friend
eddie
adding
as
the
ceremony
was
performed
eddie
keeps
a
good
team
any
time
you
want
a
sure
judge
remarked
the
driver
cordially
just
call
up
main
any
time
any
friend
of
s
can
have
anything
they
want
night
or
whereupon
he
climbed
to
his
box
and
we
at
last
drove
away
the
honourable
george
had
continued
from
the
moment
of
our
meeting
to
glance
at
me
in
a
peculiar
fashion
he
seemed
fascinated
and
yet
unequal
to
a
straight
look
at
me
he
was
undoubtedly
dazed
as
i
could
discern
from
his
absent
manner
of
opening
the
tin
of
charcoal
biscuits
and
munching
one
i
mean
to
say
it
was
too
obviously
a
mere
mechanical
impulse
i
say
he
remarked
to
cousin
egbert
who
was
beaming
fondly
at
him
how
strange
it
all
is
it
s
quite
the
little
town
in
the
state
said
cousin
egbert
but
what
makes
it
grow
so
silly
fast
demanded
the
other
enterprise
and
industries
answered
cousin
egbert
loftily
nothing
to
make
a
dust
about
remarked
the
honourable
george
staring
glassily
at
the
main
business
thoroughfare
i
ve
seen
larger
towns
scores
of
you
ain
t
begun
to
see
this
town
yet
responded
cousin
egbert
loyally
and
he
called
to
the
driver
has
he
eddie
sure
he
ain
t
said
the
driver
person
genially
wait
till
he
sees
the
new
waterworks
and
the
factory
is
he
one
of
your
gentleman
drivers
demanded
the
honourable
george
and
why
a
blind
factory
oh
eddie
s
good
people
all
right
answered
the
other
and
the
factory
turns
out
blinds
and
why
turn
them
out
he
left
this
and
continued
he
s
like
that
american
johnny
in
london
that
drives
his
own
coach
to
brighton
yes
ripping
idea
gentleman
driver
but
i
say
you
know
i
ll
sit
on
the
box
with
him
pull
up
a
bit
old
son
to
my
consternation
the
driver
chap
halted
and
before
i
could
remonstrate
the
honourable
george
had
mounted
to
the
box
beside
him
thankful
i
was
we
had
left
the
main
street
though
in
the
residence
avenue
where
the
change
was
made
we
attracted
far
more
attention
than
was
desirable
didn
t
i
tell
you
he
was
some
mixer
demanded
cousin
egbert
of
me
but
i
was
too
sickened
to
make
any
suitable
response
the
honourable
george
s
possession
of
a
single
spat
was
now
flaunted
as
it
were
in
the
face
of
red
gap
s
best
families
how
foreign
it
all
is
he
repeated
turning
back
to
us
yet
with
only
his
for
me
but
the
american
johnny
in
london
had
a
much
smarter
coach
than
this
and
better
animals
too
you
re
not
up
to
his
class
yet
old
thing
that
pinto
on
the
off
side
remarked
the
driver
can
outrun
anything
in
this
town
for
fun
money
or
marbles
called
the
honourable
george
to
us
why
marbles
silly
things
it
s
all
bally
strange
and
why
do
your
villagers
stare
so
some
little
mixer
all
right
all
right
murmured
cousin
egbert
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
as
we
drew
up
at
the
floud
home
and
yet
one
of
them
guys
back
there
called
him
a
typical
britisher
you
bet
i
shut
him
up
quick
saying
a
thing
like
that
about
a
plumb
stranger
i
d
a
mixed
it
with
him
right
there
except
i
thought
it
was
better
to
have
things
nice
and
not
start
something
the
minute
the
judge
got
with
all
possible
speed
i
hurried
the
party
indoors
for
already
faces
were
appearing
at
the
windows
of
neighbouring
houses
effie
who
met
us
allowed
her
glare
at
cousin
egbert
i
fancy
to
affect
the
cordiality
of
her
greeting
to
the
honourable
george
at
least
she
seemed
to
be
quite
as
dazed
as
he
and
there
was
a
moment
of
constraint
before
he
went
on
up
to
the
room
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
once
safely
within
the
room
i
contrived
a
moment
alone
with
him
and
removed
his
single
spat
not
too
gently
i
fear
for
the
nervous
strain
since
his
arrival
had
told
upon
me
you
have
reason
to
be
thankful
i
said
that
was
not
present
to
witness
they
cost
seven
and
six
he
muttered
regarding
the
one
spat
wistfully
but
why
mr
of
boston
and
red
gap
i
returned
sternly
he
does
himself
perfectly
to
think
he
might
have
seen
you
in
this
rowdyish
state
and
i
hastened
to
seek
a
presentable
from
his
bags
everything
is
so
strange
he
muttered
again
quite
helplessly
and
why
the
mural
decoration
at
the
edge
of
the
settlement
why
keep
one
s
eye
upon
it
why
should
they
do
such
things
i
say
it
s
all
quite
monstrous
you
i
saw
that
indeed
he
was
quite
done
for
with
amazement
so
i
ran
him
a
bath
and
procured
him
a
dish
of
tea
he
rambled
oddly
at
moments
of
things
the
guard
on
the
had
told
him
of
north
america
of
niagara
falls
and
missouri
and
other
objects
of
interest
he
was
still
almost
quite
a
bit
dotty
when
i
was
obliged
to
leave
him
for
an
appointment
with
the
raccoon
and
his
wife
to
discuss
the
menu
of
my
opening
dinner
but
cousin
egbert
who
had
rejoined
us
was
listening
sympathetically
as
i
left
the
two
were
pegging
it
from
a
bottle
of
hunting
sherry
which
the
honourable
george
had
carried
in
his
i
was
about
to
warn
him
that
he
would
come
out
spotted
but
instantly
i
saw
that
there
must
be
an
end
to
such
surveillance
i
could
not
manage
an
enterprise
of
the
magnitude
of
the
united
states
grill
and
yet
have
an
eye
to
his
meat
and
drink
i
resolved
to
let
spots
come
as
they
would
on
all
hands
i
was
now
congratulated
by
members
of
the
north
side
set
upon
the
i
had
played
in
adding
the
honourable
george
to
their
number
not
only
did
it
promise
to
reunite
certain
warring
factions
in
the
north
side
set
itself
but
it
truly
bade
fair
to
disintegrate
the
bohemian
set
wrung
my
hand
that
afternoon
begging
me
to
inform
the
honourable
george
that
he
would
call
on
the
morrow
to
pay
his
respects
judge
ballard
besought
me
to
engage
him
for
an
early
dinner
and
effie
it
is
needless
to
say
after
recovering
from
the
shock
of
his
arrival
which
she
attributed
to
cousin
egbert
s
want
of
taste
thanked
me
with
a
wealth
of
genuine
emotion
only
by
slight
degrees
then
did
it
fall
to
be
noticed
that
the
honourable
george
did
not
hold
himself
to
be
too
strictly
bound
by
our
social
conventions
as
to
whom
one
should
be
pally
with
thus
on
the
morrow
at
the
hour
when
the
called
he
was
regrettably
absent
on
what
cousin
egbert
called
a
with
the
driver
person
he
had
met
the
day
before
nor
did
they
return
until
after
the
callers
had
waited
the
better
part
of
two
hours
cousin
egbert
as
usual
received
the
blame
for
this
yet
neither
of
the
nor
effie
dared
to
upbraid
him
being
presented
to
the
callers
i
am
bound
to
say
that
the
honourable
george
showed
himself
to
be
immensely
impressed
by
whom
i
had
never
beheld
more
perfectly
vogue
in
all
his
appointments
he
became
in
fact
rather
moody
in
the
presence
of
this
subtle
niceness
of
detail
being
made
conscious
i
dare
say
of
his
own
sloppy
rumpled
cravat
and
shocking
boots
and
despite
s
amiable
efforts
to
draw
him
into
talk
about
hunting
in
the
shires
and
our
county
society
at
home
i
began
to
fear
that
they
would
not
hit
it
off
together
the
honourable
george
did
however
consent
to
drive
with
his
caller
the
following
day
and
i
relied
upon
the
tandem
to
recall
him
to
his
better
self
but
when
the
callers
had
departed
he
became
quite
almost
plaintive
to
me
i
say
you
know
i
shan
t
be
wanted
to
pal
up
much
with
that
chap
shall
i
i
mean
to
say
he
wears
so
many
clothes
they
make
me
writhe
as
if
i
wore
them
myself
it
won
t
do
you
i
told
him
very
firmly
that
this
was
piffle
of
the
most
wretched
sort
that
his
caller
wore
but
the
prescribed
number
of
garments
each
vogue
to
the
last
note
and
that
he
was
a
person
whom
one
must
know
he
responded
pettishly
that
he
vastly
preferred
the
gentleman
driver
with
whom
he
had
spent
the
afternoon
and
as
he
was
now
calling
cousin
egbert
jolly
chaps
with
no
swank
he
insisted
we
drove
quite
almost
everywhere
waterworks
cemetery
factory
you
know
i
thought
blind
factory
was
some
of
their
bally
american
slang
for
the
shop
of
a
chap
who
made
eyeglasses
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
nothing
of
the
kind
they
saw
up
timbers
there
quite
all
over
the
place
and
nail
them
up
again
into
articles
it
s
all
quite
nor
was
his
account
of
his
drive
with
the
following
day
a
bit
more
reassuring
he
wouldn
t
stop
again
at
the
factory
where
i
wished
to
see
the
timbers
being
sawed
and
nailed
but
drove
me
to
a
country
club
which
was
not
in
the
country
and
wasn
t
a
club
not
a
human
there
not
even
a
barman
fancy
a
club
of
that
sort
but
he
took
me
to
his
own
house
for
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
and
there
it
wasn
t
so
rotten
rather
a
i
think
she
is
bally
old
booming
grenadier
topping
sort
no
end
of
fun
we
palled
up
immensely
and
i
quite
forgot
the
jackson
chap
till
it
was
time
for
him
to
drive
me
back
to
these
diggings
rather
sulky
he
was
i
fancy
uppish
sort
told
him
the
old
one
was
quite
like
old
caroline
dowager
duchess
of
clewe
but
couldn
t
tell
if
it
pleased
him
seemed
to
like
it
and
seemed
not
to
rather
uncertain
asked
him
why
the
people
of
the
settlement
pronounced
his
name
belknap
hyphen
jackson
and
that
seemed
to
make
him
snarky
again
i
mean
to
say
names
with
hyphen
marks
in
em
i
d
never
heard
the
hyphen
pronounced
before
but
everything
is
so
strange
he
said
only
the
lowest
classes
did
it
as
a
form
of
coarse
wit
and
that
he
was
wasting
himself
here
wouldn
t
stay
another
day
if
it
were
not
for
family
reasons
queer
sort
of
wheeze
to
say
hyphen
in
a
chap
s
name
as
if
it
were
a
word
when
it
wasn
t
at
all
the
old
girl
though
bellower
she
is
perfectly
familiar
with
cattle
all
that
sort
of
thing
sent
away
the

sherry
and
had

bring
whiskey
and
soda
the
hyphen
chap
fidgeted
a
good
bit
nervous
sort
i
take
it
looked
through
a
score
of
magazines
i
dare
say
when
he
found
we
didn
t
notice
him
much
turned
the
leaves
too
fast
to
see
anything
though
made
noises
and
coughed
that
sort
of
thing
fine
old

daughter
hyphen
chap

wife
tried
to
talk
too
some
rot
about
the
season
being
well
on
here
and
was
there
a
good
deal
of
society
in
london
and
would
i
be
free
for
dinner
on
the
ninth
silly
chatter
old

talked
sense
cattle
mines
timber
blind

that
kind
of
thing
shall
see
her
often
not
the
hyphen
chap
though
too
much
like
one
of
those
bond
street
vague
misgivings
here
beset
me
as
to
the
value
of
the
honourable
george
to
the
north
side
set
nor
could
i
feel
at
all
reassured
on
the
following
day
when
effie
held
an
afternoon
reception
in
his
honour
that
he
should
be
unaware
of
the
event
s
importance
was
to
be
expected
for
as
yet
i
had
been
unable
to
get
him
to
take
the
red
gap
social
crisis
seriously
at
the
hour
when
he
should
have
been
dressed
and
ready
i
found
him
playing
at
cribbage
with
cousin
egbert
in
the
latter
s
apartment
and
to
my
dismay
he
insisted
upon
finishing
the
rubber
although
guests
were
already
arriving
even
when
the
game
was
done
he
flatly
refused
to
dress
suitably
declaring
that
his
should
be
entirely
acceptable
to
these
rough
frontier
people
and
he
consented
to
go
down
at
all
only
on
condition
that
cousin
egbert
would
accompany
him
thereafter
for
an
hour
the
two
of
them
drank
tea
uncomfortably
as
often
as
it
was
given
them
and
while
the
honourable
george
undoubtedly
made
his
impression
i
could
not
but
regret
that
he
had
so
few
conversational
graces
how
different
i
reflected
had
been
my
own
entr√©e
into
this
county
society
as
well
as
i
might
i
again
carried
off
the
day
for
the
honourable
george
endeavouring
from
time
to
time
to
put
him
at
his
ease
yet
he
breathed
an
unfeigned
sigh
of
relief
when
the
last
guest
had
left
and
he
could
resume
his
cribbage
with
cousin
egbert
but
he
had
received
one
impression
of
which
i
was
glad
an
impression
of
my
own
altered
social
quality
for
i
had
graced
the
occasion
with
an
urbanity
which
was
as
far
beyond
him
as
it
must
have
been
astonishing
it
was
now
that
he
began
to
take
seriously
what
i
had
told
him
of
my
business
enterprise
so
many
of
the
guests
having
mentioned
it
to
him
in
terms
of
the
utmost
enthusiasm
after
my
first
accounts
to
him
he
had
persisted
in
referring
to
it
as
a
a
sort
of
place
where
schoolboys
would
exchange
their
halfpence
for
toffy
and
marbles
now
he
demanded
to
be
shown
the
premises
and
was
at
once
duly
impressed
both
with
their
quiet
elegance
and
my
own
business
acumen
how
it
had
all
come
about
and
why
i
should
be
addressed
as
colonel
ruggles
and
treated
as
a
person
of
some
importance
in
the
community
i
dare
say
he
has
never
comprehended
to
this
day
as
i
had
planned
to
do
i
later
endeavoured
to
explain
to
him
that
in
north
america
persons
were
almost
quite
equal
to
one
another
being
born
so
but
at
this
he
told
me
not
to
be
silly
and
continued
to
regard
my
rise
as
an
insoluble
part
of
the
strangeness
he
everywhere
encountered
even
after
i
added
that
demosthenes
was
the
son
of
a
cutler
that
cardinal
wolsey
s
father
had
been
a
pork
butcher
and
that
garfield
had
worked
on
a
i
found
him
quite
hopeless
chaps
go
dotty
talkin
that
piffle
was
his
comment
at
another
time
i
dare
say
i
should
have
been
rather
distressed
over
this
inability
of
the
honourable
george
to
comprehend
and
adapt
himself
to
the
peculiarities
of
american
life
as
readily
as
i
had
done
but
just
now
i
was
quite
too
taken
up
with
the
details
of
my
opening
to
give
it
the
deeper
consideration
it
deserved
in
fact
there
were
moments
when
i
confessed
to
myself
that
i
did
not
care
tuppence
about
it
such
was
the
strain
upon
my
executive
faculties
when
decorators
and
furnishers
had
done
their
work
when
the
choice
carpet
was
laid
when
the
kitchen
and
table
equipments
were
completed
to
the
last
detail
and
when
the
lighting
was
artistically
correct
there
was
still
the
matter
of
service
as
to
this
i
conceived
and
carried
out
what
i
fancy
was
rather
a
brilliant
stroke
which
was
nothing
less
than
to
eliminate
the
fellow
hobbs
as
a
social
factor
of
even
the
bohemian
set
in
contracting
with
him
for
my
bread
and
rolls
i
took
an
early
opportunity
of
setting
the
chap
in
his
place
as
indeed
it
was
not
difficult
to
do
when
he
had
observed
the
splendid
scale
on
which
i
was
operating
at
our
second
interview
he
was
removing
his
hat
and
addressing
me
as
while
i
have
found
that
i
can
quite
gracefully
place
myself
on
a
level
with
the
american
there
is
a
serving
type
of
our
own
people
to
which
i
shall
eternally
feel
superior
the
hobbs
fellow
was
of
this
sort
having
undeniably
the
soul
of
a
lackey
in
addition
to
jobbing
his
bread
and
rolls
i
engaged
him
as
pantry
man
and
took
on
such
members
of
his
numerous
family
as
were
competent
his
wife
was
to
assist
my
raccoon
cook
in
the
kitchen
three
of
his
sons
were
to
serve
as
waiters
and
his
youngest
a
lad
in
his
teens
i
installed
as
vestiare
garbing
him
in
a
smart
uniform
and
posting
him
to
relieve
my
gentleman
patrons
of
their
hats
and
a
daughter
was
similarly
installed
as
maid
and
the
two
achieved
an
effect
of
smartness
unprecedented
in
red
gap
an
effect
to
which
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
community
responded
instantly
in
other
establishments
it
was
the
custom
for
patrons
to
hang
their
garments
on
often
under
a
printed
warning
that
the
proprietor
would
disclaim
responsibility
in
case
of
loss
in
the
one
known
as
bert
s
place
indeed
the
warning
was
positively
vulgar
watch
your
of
course
that
sort
of
coarseness
would
have
been
impossible
in
my
own
place
as
another
important
detail
i
had
taken
over
from
judson
her
stock
of
jellies
and
compotes
which
i
had
found
to
be
of
a
most
excellent
character
and
had
ordered
as
much
more
as
she
could
manage
to
produce
together
with
cut
flowers
from
her
garden
for
my
tables
she
herself
being
a
young
woman
of
the
most
pleasing
capabilities
had
done
a
bit
of
charring
for
me
and
was
now
to
be
in
charge
of
the
glassware
linen
and
silver
i
had
found
her
indeed
highly
sympathetic
with
my
highest
aims
and
not
a
few
of
her
suggestions
as
to
management
proved
to
be
entirely
sound
her
unspeakable
dog
continued
his
quite
objectionable
advances
to
me
at
every
opportunity
in
spite
of
my
hitting
him
about
rather
when
i
could
do
so
unobserved
but
the
sinister
interpretation
that
might
be
placed
upon
this
by
the
was
now
happily
answered
by
the
circumstance
of
her
being
in
my
employment
her
child
i
regret
to
say
was
still
grossly
overfed
seldom
having
its
face
free
from
jam
or
other
smears
it
persisted
moreover
in
twisting
my
name
into
ruggums
which
i
found
not
a
little
embarrassing
the
night
of
my
opening
found
me
calmly
awaiting
the
triumph
that
was
due
me
as
some
one
has
said
of
napoleon
i
had
won
my
battle
in
my
tent
before
the
firing
of
a
single
shot
i
mean
to
say
i
had
looked
so
conscientiously
after
details
even
to
assuring
myself
that
cousin
egbert
and
the
honourable
george
would
appear
in
evening
dress
my
last
act
having
been
to
coerce
each
of
them
into
purchasing
varnished
boots
the
former
submitting
meekly
enough
though
the
honourable
george
insisted
it
was
a
silly
fuss
at
seven
o
clock
having
devoted
a
final
inspection
to
the
kitchen
where
the
female
raccoon
was
well
on
with
the
dinner
and
having
noted
that
the
members
of
my
staff
were
in
their
places
i
gave
a
last
pleased
survey
of
my
with
its
smartly
equipped
tables
gleaming
in
the
softened
light
from
my
shaded
candlesticks
truly
it
was
a
scene
of
refined
elegance
such
as
red
gap
had
never
before
witnessed
within
its
own
confines
and
i
had
seen
to
it
that
the
dinner
as
well
would
mark
an
epoch
in
the
lives
of
these
simple
but
worthy
people
not
a
heavy
nor
a
cloying
repast
would
they
find
indeed
the
bare
simplicity
of
my
menu
had
it
been
previously
disclosed
would
doubtless
have
disappointed
more
than
one
of
my
patronesses
but
each
item
had
been
perfected
to
an
extent
never
achieved
by
them
their
weakness
had
ever
been
to
serve
a
profusion
of
neutral
dishes
pleasing
enough
to
the
eye
but
unedifying
except
as
a
spectacle
i
mean
to
say
as
food
it
was
noncommittal
it
failed
to
intrigue
i
should
serve
only
a
thin
soup
a
fish
small
birds
two
vegetables
a
salad
a
sweet
and
a
savoury
but
each
item
would
prove
worthy
of
the
profoundest
consideration
in
the
matter
of
thin
soup
for
example
the
local
practice
was
to
serve
a
fluid
of
which
beyond
the
circumstance
that
it
was
warmish
and
slightly
tinted
nothing
of
interest
could
ever
be
ascertained
my
own
thin
soup
would
be
a
revelation
to
them
again
in
the
matter
of
fish
this
course
with
the
hostesses
of
red
gap
had
seemed
to
be
merely
an
excuse
for
a
pause
i
had
truly
sympathized
with
cousin
egbert
s
bitter
complaint
they
hand
you
a
dab
of
something
about
the
size
of
a
with
two
strings
of
for
the
first
time
then
the
fish
course
in
red
gap
was
to
be
an
event
an
abundant
portion
of
native
fish
with
a
lobster
sauce
which
i
had
carried
out
to
its
highest
power
my
birds
hot
from
the
oven
would
be
food
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
my
vegetables
cooked
with
a
zealous
attention
and
my
sweet
immensely
appealing
without
being
pretentiously
spectacular
and
for
what
i
believed
to
be
quite
the
first
time
in
the
town
good
coffee
would
be
served
disheartening
indeed
had
been
the
various
attenuations
of
coffee
which
had
been
imposed
upon
me
in
my
brief
career
as
a
among
these
people
not
one
among
them
had
possessed
the
genius
to
master
an
acceptable
decoction
of
the
berry
the
bald
simplicity
of
the
correct
formula
being
doubtless
incredible
to
them
the
blare
of
a
motor
horn
aroused
me
from
this
musing
and
from
that
moment
i
had
little
time
for
meditation
until
the
evening
as
the
recorded
the
next
morning
had
gone
down
into
my
patrons
arrived
in
groups
couples
or
singly
almost
faster
than
i
could
seat
them
the
hobbs
lad
as
vestiare
would
halt
them
for
hats
and
wraps
during
which
pause
they
would
emit
subdued
cries
of
surprise
and
delight
at
my
beautifully
toned
ensemble
after
which
as
they
walked
to
their
tables
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
they
were
properly
impressed
effie
escorted
by
the
honourable
george
and
cousin
egbert
was
among
the
early
arrivals
the
senator
being
absent
from
town
at
a
sitting
of
the
house
these
were
quickly
followed
by
the
and
the
mixer
resplendent
in
purple
satin
and
diamonds
all
being
at
one
of
my
large
tables
so
that
the
honourable
george
sat
between
and
effie
though
he
at
first
made
a
somewhat
undignified
essay
to
seat
himself
next
the
mixer
needless
to
say
all
were
in
evening
dress
though
the
honourable
george
had
fumbled
grossly
with
his
cravat
and
rumpled
his
shirt
nor
had
he
submitted
to
having
his
beard
trimmed
as
i
had
warned
him
to
do
as
for
i
had
never
beheld
him
more
truly
vogue
in
every
detail
and
his
slightly
austere
manner
in
any
red
gap
gathering
had
never
set
him
better
both
and
effie
wielded
their
lorgnons
upon
the
later
comers
thus
giving
their
table
quite
an
air
judge
ballard
who
had
come
to
be
one
of
my
staunchest
adherents
occupied
an
adjacent
table
with
her
family
party
and
two
or
three
of
the
younger
dancing
set
the
indian
tuttle
with
his
wife
and
two
daughters
were
also
among
the
early
comers
and
i
could
not
but
marvel
anew
at
the
red
man
s
histrionic
powers
in
almost
quite
correct
evening
attire
and
entirely
decorous
in
speech
and
gesture
he
might
readily
have
been
thought
some
one
that
mattered
had
he
not
at
an
early
opportunity
caught
my
eye
and
winked
with
a
sly
significance
quite
almost
every
one
of
the
north
side
set
was
present
imparting
to
my
room
a
general
air
of
distinguished
smartness
and
in
addition
there
were
not
a
few
of
what
had
called
the
rabble
persons
of
no
social
value
to
be
sure
but
honest
folk
small
tradesmen
and
the
like
these
plain
people
i
may
say
i
took
especial
pains
to
welcome
and
put
at
their
ease
for
i
had
resolved
in
effect
to
be
one
of
them
after
the
manner
prescribed
by
their
declaration
thing
with
quite
all
of
them
i
chatted
easily
a
moment
or
two
expressing
the
hope
that
they
would
be
well
pleased
with
their
entertainment
i
noted
while
thus
engaged
that
eyed
me
with
frank
and
superior
cynicism
but
this
affected
me
quite
not
at
all
and
i
took
pains
to
point
my
indifference
chatting
with
increased
urbanity
with
the
two
hank
and
buck
who
had
entered
rather
uncertainly
not
in
evening
dress
to
be
sure
but
in
decent
black
as
befitted
their
stations
when
i
had
prevailed
upon
them
to
surrender
their
hats
to
the
vestiare
and
had
seated
them
at
a
table
for
two
they
informed
me
in
hoarse
undertones
that
they
were
prepared
to
put
a
bet
down
on
every
card
from
soda
to
hock
so
that
i
at
first
suspected
they
had
thought
me
conducting
a
gaming
establishment
but
ultimately
gathered
that
they
were
merely
expressing
a
cordial
determination
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
there
then
entered
somewhat
to
my
uneasiness
the
klondike
woman
and
her
party
being
almost
the
last
it
will
be
understood
that
they
created
no
little
sensation
as
she
led
them
down
the
thronged
room
to
her
table
she
was
wearing
an
evening
gown
of
lustrous
black
with
the
apparently
simple
lines
that
are
so
baffling
to
any
but
the
expert
maker
with
a
black
picture
hat
that
suited
her
no
end
i
saw
more
than
one
matron
of
the
north
side
set
stiffen
in
her
seat
while
and
effie
turned
upon
her
the
chilling
broadside
of
their
lorgnons
merely
drew
himself
up
austerely
the
three
other
women
of
her
party
flutterers
rather
did
little
but
set
off
their
hostess
the
four
men
were
of
a
youngish
sort
chaps
in
banks
chemists
assistants
that
sort
of
thing
who
were
constantly
to
be
seen
in
her
train
they
were
especially
reprobated
by
the
matrons
of
the
correct
set
by
reason
of
their
deliberately
choosing
to
ally
themselves
with
the
bohemian
set
acutely
feeling
the
antagonism
aroused
by
this
group
i
was
momentarily
discouraged
in
a
design
i
had
half
formed
of
using
my
undoubted
influence
to
unite
the
warring
social
factions
of
red
gap
even
as
bismarck
had
once
brought
the
warring
prussian
states
together
in
a
federated
germany
i
began
to
see
that
the
klondike
woman
would
forever
prove
unacceptable
to
the
north
side
set
the
cliques
would
unite
against
her
even
if
one
should
find
in
her
a
spirit
of
reconciliation
which
i
supremely
doubted
the
bustle
having
in
a
measure
subsided
i
gave
orders
for
the
soup
to
be
served
at
the
same
time
turning
the
current
into
the
electric
pianoforte
i
had
wished
for
this
opening
number
something
attractive
yet
dignified
which
would
in
a
manner
of
speaking
symbolize
an
occasion
to
me
at
least
highly
momentous
to
this
end
i
had
chosen
handel
s
celebrated
largo
and
at
the
first
strains
of
this
highly
meritorious
composition
i
knew
that
i
had
chosen
surely
i
am
sure
the
piece
was
indelibly
engraved
upon
the
minds
of
those
many
who
were
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
realizing
that
a
thin
soup
may
be
made
a
thing
to
take
seriously
nominally
i
occupied
a
seat
at
the
table
with
the
and
effie
though
i
apprehended
having
to
be
more
or
less
up
and
down
in
the
direction
of
my
staff
having
now
seated
myself
to
soup
i
was
for
the
first
time
made
aware
of
the
curious
behaviour
of
the
honourable
george
disregarding
his
own
soup
which
was
of
itself
unusual
with
him
he
was
staring
straight
ahead
with
a
curious
intensity
a
half
turn
of
my
head
was
enough
he
sat
facing
the
klondike
woman
as
i
again
turned
a
bit
i
saw
that
under
cover
of
her
animated
converse
with
her
table
companions
she
was
at
intervals
allowing
her
very
effective
eyes
to
rest
as
if
absently
upon
him
i
may
say
now
that
a
curious
chill
seized
me
bringing
with
it
a
sudden
psychic
warning
that
all
was
not
going
to
be
as
it
should
be
some
calamity
impended
the
man
was
quite
apparently
fascinated
staring
with
a
fixed
hypnotic
intensity
that
had
already
been
noted
by
his
companions
on
either
side
with
a
word
about
the
soup
shot
quickly
and
directly
at
him
i
managed
to
divert
his
gaze
but
his
eyes
had
returned
even
before
the
spoon
had
gone
once
to
his
lips
the
second
time
there
was
a
soup
stain
upon
his
already
rumpled
shirt
front
presently
it
became
only
too
horribly
certain
that
the
man
was
out
of
himself
for
when
the
fish
course
was
served
he
remained
serenely
unconscious
that
none
of
the
lobster
sauce
accompanied
his
own
portion
it
was
a
rich
sauce
and
the
almost
immediate
effect
of
upon
his
complexion
being
only
too
well
known
to
me
i
had
directed
that
his
fish
should
be
served
without
it
though
i
had
fully
expected
him
to
row
me
for
it
and
perhaps
create
a
scene
the
circumstance
of
his
blindly
attacking
the
unsauced
fish
was
eloquent
indeed
the
and
effie
were
now
plainly
alarmed
and
somewhat
feverishly
sought
to
engage
his
attention
with
the
result
only
that
he
snapped
monosyllables
at
them
without
removing
his
gaze
from
its
mark
and
the
woman
was
now
too
obviously
pluming
herself
upon
the
effect
she
had
achieved
upon
us
all
she
flashed
an
amused
consciousness
of
her
power
yet
with
a
fine
affectation
of
quite
ignoring
us
i
was
here
obliged
to
leave
the
table
to
oversee
the
serving
of
the
wine
returning
after
an
interval
to
find
the
situation
unchanged
save
that
the
woman
no
longer
glanced
at
the
honourable
george
such
were
her
tactics
having
enmeshed
him
she
confidently
left
him
to
complete
his
own
undoing
i
had
returned
with
the
serving
of
the
small
birds
observing
his
own
before
him
the
honourable
george
wished
to
be
told
why
he
had
not
been
served
with
fish
and
only
with
difficulty
could
be
convinced
that
he
had
partaken
of
this
of
course
in
public
places
one
must
expect
to
come
into
contact
with
persons
of
that
sort
remarked
effie
something
should
be
done
about
it
observed
and
they
both
murmured
creature
though
it
was
plain
that
the
honourable
george
had
little
notion
to
whom
they
referred
observing
however
that
the
woman
no
longer
glanced
at
him
he
fell
to
his
bird
somewhat
as
indeed
did
all
my
guests
from
every
side
i
could
hear
eager
approval
of
the
repast
which
was
now
being
supplemented
at
most
of
the
tables
by
a
sound
wine
of
the
burgundy
type
which
i
had
recommended
or
by
a
dry
champagne
meantime
the
electric
pianoforte
played
steadily
through
a
repertoire
that
had
progressed
from
the
largo
to
more
vivacious
pieces
of
the
american
folkdance
school
as
was
said
in
the
press
the
following
day
gayety
and
reigned
supreme
and
one
and
all
felt
that
it
was
indeed
good
to
be
through
the
sweet
and
the
savoury
the
dinner
progressed
the
latter
proving
to
be
a
novelty
that
the
hostesses
of
red
gap
thereafter
slavishly
copied
and
with
the
advent
of
the
coffee
ensued
a
noticeable
relaxation
people
began
to
visit
one
another
s
tables
and
there
was
a
blithe
undercurrent
of
praise
for
my
efforts
to
smarten
the
town
s
public
dining
the
klondike
woman
i
fancy
was
the
first
to
light
a
cigarette
though
quickly
followed
by
the
ladies
of
her
party
and
effie
after
a
period
of
futile
glaring
at
her
through
the
lorgnons
seemed
to
make
their
resolves
simultaneously
and
forthwith
themselves
lighted
cigarettes
of
course
it
s
done
in
the
smart
english
restaurants
murmured
as
he
assisted
the
ladies
to
their
lights
thereupon
judge
ballard
farther
down
the
room
began
to
smoke
what
i
believe
was
her
first
cigarette
which
proved
to
be
a
signal
for
other
ladies
of
the
onwards
and
upwards
society
to
do
the
same
ballard
being
their
president
it
occurred
to
me
that
these
ladies
were
grimly
bent
on
showing
the
klondike
woman
that
they
could
trifle
quite
as
gracefully
as
she
with
the
lesser
vices
of
bohemia
or
perhaps
they
wished
to
demonstrate
to
the
younger
dancing
men
in
her
train
that
the
north
side
set
was
not
desolately
austere
in
its
recreation
the
honourable
george
i
regret
to
say
produced
a
smelly
pipe
which
he
would
have
lighted
but
at
a
shocked
and
cold
glance
from
me
he
put
it
by
and
allowed
the
mixer
to
roll
him
one
of
the
yellow
paper
cigarettes
from
a
sack
of
tobacco
which
she
had
produced
from
some
secret
recess
of
her
costume
cousin
egbert
had
been
excitedly
happy
throughout
the
meal
and
now
paid
me
a
quaint
compliment
upon
the
food
some
eats
bill
he
called
to
me
i
got
to
hand
it
to
you
though
what
precisely
it
was
he
wished
to
hand
me
i
never
ascertained
for
the
mixer
at
that
moment
claimed
my
attention
with
a
compliment
of
her
own
that
said
she
is
the
only
dinner
i
ve
eaten
for
a
long
time
that
was
composed
entirely
of
this
hour
succeeding
the
repast
i
found
quite
entirely
agreeable
more
than
one
person
that
mattered
assuring
me
that
i
had
assisted
red
gap
to
a
notable
advance
in
the
finest
and
correctest
sense
of
the
word
and
it
was
with
a
very
definite
regret
that
i
beheld
my
guests
departing
returning
to
our
table
from
a
group
of
these
who
had
called
me
to
make
their
adieus
i
saw
that
a
most
regrettable
incident
had
occurred
nothing
less
than
the
formal
presentation
of
the
honourable
george
to
the
klondike
woman
and
the
mixer
had
appallingly
done
it
everything
is
so
strange
here
i
heard
him
saying
as
i
passed
their
table
and
the
woman
echoed
everything
while
her
glance
enveloped
him
with
a
curious
effect
of
appraisal
the
others
of
her
party
were
making
much
of
him
i
could
see
quite
as
if
they
had
preposterous
designs
of
wresting
him
from
the
north
side
set
to
be
one
of
themselves
and
effie
affected
to
ignore
the
meeting
stared
into
vacancy
with
a
quite
shocked
expression
as
if
vandals
had
desecrated
an
altar
in
his
presence
cousin
egbert
having
drawn
off
one
of
his
newly
purchased
boots
during
the
dinner
was
now
replacing
it
with
audible
groans
but
i
caught
his
joyous
comment
a
moment
later
didn
t
i
tell
you
the
judge
was
some
mixer
mixing
indeed
snapped
the
ladies
a
later
the
historic
evening
had
come
to
an
end
the
last
guest
had
departed
and
all
of
my
staff
save
judson
and
her
male
child
these
i
begged
to
escort
to
their
home
since
the
way
was
rather
far
and
dark
the
child
incautiously
left
in
the
kitchen
at
the
mercy
of
the
female
black
had
with
criminal
stupidity
been
stuffed
with
food
traces
of
almost
every
course
of
the
dinner
being
apparent
upon
its
puffy
countenance
being
now
in
a
stupor
from
overfeeding
i
was
obliged
to
lug
the
thing
over
my
shoulder
i
resolved
to
warn
the
mother
at
an
early
opportunity
of
the
perils
of
an
unrestricted
diet
although
the
deluded
creature
seemed
actually
to
glory
in
its
corpulence
i
discovered
when
halfway
to
her
residence
that
the
thing
was
still
tightly
clutching
the
gnawed
of
a
fowl
which
was
spotting
the
shoulder
of
my
smartest
the
mother
however
was
so
ingenuously
delighted
with
my
success
and
so
full
of
prattle
concerning
my
future
triumphs
that
i
forbore
to
instruct
her
at
this
time
i
may
say
that
of
all
my
staff
she
had
betrayed
the
most
intelligent
understanding
of
my
ideals
and
i
bade
her
with
a
strong
conviction
that
she
would
greatly
assist
me
in
the
future
she
also
promised
that
barker
should
thereafter
be
locked
in
a
cellar
at
such
times
as
she
was
serving
me
returning
through
the
town
i
heard
strains
of
music
from
the
establishment
known
as
bert
s
place
and
was
shocked
on
staring
through
his
show
window
to
observe
the
honourable
george
and
cousin
egbert
waltzing
madly
with
the
hank
and
buck
to
the
strains
of
a
mechanical
piano
the
honourable
george
had
exchanged
his
for
his
partner
s
hat
which
came
down
over
his
ears
in
a
most
regrettable
manner
i
thought
it
best
not
to
intrude
upon
their
coarse
amusement
and
went
on
to
the
grill
to
see
that
all
was
safe
for
the
night
returning
from
my
inspection
some
later
i
came
upon
the
two
cousin
egbert
in
the
lead
the
honourable
george
behind
him
they
greeted
me
somewhat
boisterously
but
i
saw
that
they
were
now
content
to
return
home
and
to
bed
as
they
walked
somewhat
mincingly
i
noticed
that
they
were
in
their
hose
carrying
their
varnished
boots
in
either
hand
of
the
honourable
george
who
still
wore
the
s
hat
i
began
now
to
have
the
gravest
doubts
there
had
been
an
evil
light
in
the
eyes
of
the
klondike
woman
and
her
bohemian
cohorts
as
they
surveyed
him
as
he
preceded
me
i
heard
him
murmur
ecstatically
sush
is
chapter
fifteen
launched
now
upon
a
business
venture
that
would
require
my
unremitting
attention
if
it
were
to
prosper
it
may
be
imagined
that
i
had
little
leisure
for
the
social
vagaries
of
the
honourable
george
shocking
as
these
might
be
to
one
s
finer
tastes
and
yet
on
the
following
morning
i
found
time
to
tell
him
what
to
put
it
quite
bluntly
i
gave
him
beans
for
his
loose
behaviour
the
previous
evening
in
publicly
ogling
and
meeting
as
an
equal
one
whom
one
didn
t
know
to
my
amazement
instead
of
being
heartily
ashamed
of
his
licentiousness
i
found
him
recalcitrant
stubborn
as
a
mule
he
was
and
with
a
low
animal
cunning
that
i
had
never
given
him
credit
for
demosthenes
was
the
son
of
a
cutler
said
he
and
napoleon
worked
on
a
what
didn
t
you
say
so
yourself
you
juggins
what
fancy
there
being
upper
and
lower
classes
among
natives
what
rot
and
i
like
north
america
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
straight
i
m
going
to
take
it
horrified
by
these
reckless
words
i
could
only
say
noblesse
oblige
meaning
to
convey
that
whatever
the
north
americans
did
the
next
earl
of
brinstead
must
not
meet
persons
one
doesn
t
know
whereat
he
rejoined
tartly
that
i
was
to
stow
that
piffle
being
now
quite
alarmed
i
took
the
further
time
to
call
upon
believing
that
he
if
any
one
could
recall
the
honourable
george
to
his
better
nature
he
too
was
shocked
as
i
had
been
and
at
first
would
have
put
the
blame
entirely
upon
the
shoulders
of
cousin
egbert
but
at
this
i
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
honourable
george
had
too
often
shown
a
regrettable
fondness
for
the
society
of
persons
that
did
not
matter
especially
females
and
i
cited
the
case
of
the
and
the
brixton
millinery
person
with
either
of
whom
he
would
have
allied
himself
in
marriage
had
not
his
lordship
intervened
was
quite
properly
horrified
at
these
revelations
has
he
no
sense
of
noblesse
oblige
he
demanded
at
which
i
quoted
the
result
of
my
own
use
of
this
phrase
to
the
unfortunate
man
quite
too
plain
it
was
that
noblesse
oblige
would
never
stop
him
from
yielding
to
his
baser
impulses
we
must
be
tactful
then
remarked
without
appearing
to
oppose
him
we
must
yet
show
him
who
is
really
who
in
red
gap
we
shall
let
him
see
that
we
have
standards
which
must
be
as
rigidly
adhered
to
as
those
of
an
older
civilization
i
fancy
it
can
be
privately
i
fancied
not
yet
i
forbore
to
say
this
or
to
prolong
the
painful
interview
particularly
as
i
was
due
at
the
united
states
grill
the
of
that
morning
had
done
me
handsomely
declaring
my
opening
to
have
been
a
social
event
long
to
be
remembered
and
describing
the
costumes
of
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
smartly
gowned
matrons
quite
as
if
it
had
been
an
assembly
ball
my
task
now
was
to
see
that
the
grill
was
kept
to
the
high
level
of
its
opening
both
as
a
social
ganglion
if
one
may
use
the
term
and
as
a
place
to
which
the
public
would
ever
turn
for
food
that
mattered
for
my
first
luncheon
the
raccoons
had
prepared
under
my
direction
a
pie
in
addition
to
which
i
offered
a
thick
soup
and
a
pudding
of
high
nutritive
value
to
my
pleased
astonishment
the
crowd
at
midday
was
quite
all
that
my
staff
could
serve
several
of
the
hobbs
brood
being
at
school
and
the
luncheon
was
received
with
every
sign
of
approval
by
the
business
persons
who
sat
to
it
not
only
were
there
drapers
chemists
and
but
solicitors
and
barristers
bankers
and
estate
agents
and
all
quite
eager
with
their
praise
of
my
fare
to
each
of
these
i
explained
that
i
should
give
them
but
few
things
but
that
these
would
be
food
in
the
finest
sense
of
the
word
adding
that
the
fault
of
the
american
school
lay
in
attempting
a
profusion
of
dishes
none
of
which
in
consequence
could
be
raised
to
its
highest
power
so
sound
was
my
theory
and
so
nicely
did
my
luncheon
demonstrate
it
that
i
was
engaged
on
the
spot
to
provide
the
banquet
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
the
president
of
which
rather
seriously
proposed
that
it
now
be
made
a
monthly
affair
since
they
would
no
longer
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
hotel
caterer
whose
ambition
ran
inversely
to
his
skill
indeed
after
the
pudding
i
was
this
day
asked
to
become
a
member
of
the
body
and
i
now
felt
that
i
was
indubitably
one
of
them
america
and
i
had
taken
each
other
as
seriously
as
could
be
desired
more
than
once
during
the
afternoon
i
wondered
rather
painfully
what
the
honourable
george
might
be
doing
i
knew
that
he
had
been
promised
to
a
meeting
of
the
onwards
and
upwards
club
through
the
influence
of
effie
where
it
had
been
hoped
that
he
would
give
a
talk
on
country
life
in
england
at
least
she
had
hinted
to
them
that
he
might
do
this
though
i
had
known
from
the
beginning
that
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
and
had
merely
hoped
that
he
would
appear
for
a
dish
of
tea
and
stay
quiet
which
was
as
much
as
the
north
side
set
could
expect
of
him
induced
to
speak
i
was
quite
certain
he
would
tell
them
straight
that
country
life
in
england
was
silly
rot
and
that
was
all
to
it
now
not
having
seen
him
during
the
day
i
could
but
hope
that
he
had
attended
the
gathering
in
suitable
afternoon
attire
and
that
he
would
have
divined
that
the
s
hat
did
not
coordinate
with
this
at
while
i
was
still
concerned
over
the
possible
misadventures
of
the
honourable
george
my
first
patrons
for
tea
began
to
arrive
for
i
had
let
it
be
known
that
i
should
specialize
in
this
toasted
crumpets
there
were
and
muffins
and
a
tea
cake
rich
with
plums
and
tea
i
need
not
say
which
was
all
that
tea
could
be
several
tables
were
filled
with
prominent
ladies
of
the
north
side
set
who
were
loud
in
their
exclamations
of
delight
especially
at
the
finished
smartness
of
my
service
for
it
was
perhaps
now
that
the
profoundly
serious
thought
i
had
given
to
my
silver
linen
and
glassware
showed
to
best
advantage
i
suspect
that
this
was
the
first
time
many
of
my
guests
had
encountered
a
tea
cozy
since
from
that
day
they
began
to
be
prevalent
in
red
gap
homes
also
my
wagon
containing
the
crumpets
muffins
tea
cake
jam
and
which
i
now
used
for
the
first
time
created
a
veritable
sensation
there
was
an
agreeable
hum
of
chatter
from
these
early
comers
when
i
found
myself
welcoming
judge
ballard
and
half
a
dozen
members
of
the
onwards
and
upwards
club
all
of
them
wearing
what
i
made
out
to
be
a
baffled
look
from
these
i
presently
managed
to
gather
that
their
guest
of
honour
for
the
afternoon
had
simply
not
appeared
and
that
the
meeting
after
awaiting
him
for
two
hours
had
dissolved
in
some
resentment
the
time
having
been
spent
chiefly
in
an
unflattering
dissection
of
the
klondike
woman
s
behaviour
the
evening
before
he
is
a
naughty
man
to
disappoint
us
so
cruelly
declared
judge
ballard
of
the
honourable
george
but
the
coquetry
of
it
was
feigned
to
cover
a
very
real
irritation
i
made
haste
with
possible
excuses
i
said
that
he
might
be
ill
or
that
important
letters
in
that
day
s
post
might
have
detained
him
i
knew
he
had
been
astonishingly
well
that
morning
also
that
he
loathed
letters
and
almost
practically
never
received
any
but
something
had
to
be
said
a
naughty
naughty
fellow
repeated
ballard
and
the
members
of
her
party
echoed
it
they
had
looked
forward
rather
pathetically
i
saw
to
hearing
about
country
life
in
england
from
one
who
had
lived
it
i
was
now
drawn
to
greet
the
who
entered
and
to
the
pleasure
of
winning
their
hearty
approval
for
the
perfection
of
my
arrangements
as
the
wife
presently
joined
ballard
s
group
the
husband
called
me
to
his
table
and
disclosed
that
almost
the
worst
might
be
feared
of
the
honourable
george
he
was
at
that
moment
it
appeared
with
a
rabble
of
and
members
of
the
lower
class
gathered
at
a
stockade
at
the
edge
of
town
where
various
native
horses
fresh
from
the
wilderness
were
being
taught
to
be
ridden
the
wretched
floud
is
with
him
continued
my
informant
also
the
tuttle
chap
who
continues
to
be
received
by
our
best
people
in
spite
of
my
remonstrances
and
he
yells
quite
like
a
demon
when
one
of
the
riders
is
thrown
i
passed
as
quickly
as
i
could
the
spectacle
was
of
course
i
make
allowances
for
s
ignorance
of
our
standards
it
was
nothing
short
of
disgusting
a
man
of
his
position
consorting
with
the
herd
he
told
me
no
longer
ago
than
this
morning
i
said
that
he
was
going
to
take
up
he
said
with
bitter
emphasis
you
should
see
what
he
has
on
a
cowboy
hat
and
chapps
and
the
very
lowest
of
them
are
calling
him
judge
he
flunked
a
meeting
of
the
onwards
and
upwards
society
i
added
i
know
i
know
and
who
could
have
expected
it
in
one
of
his
lineage
at
this
very
moment
he
should
be
conducting
himself
as
one
of
his
class
can
you
wonder
at
my
impatience
with
the
west
here
at
an
hour
when
our
social
life
should
be
in
evidence
when
all
trade
should
be
forgotten
i
am
the
only
man
in
the
town
who
shows
himself
in
a
and
over
there
debasing
himself
with
our
commonest
sort
all
at
once
i
saw
that
i
myself
must
bear
the
brunt
of
this
scandal
i
had
brought
hither
the
honourable
george
promising
a
personage
who
would
for
once
and
all
unify
the
north
side
set
and
perhaps
disintegrate
its
rival
i
had
been
felicitated
upon
my
and
now
it
seemed
i
had
come
a
cropper
but
i
resolved
not
to
give
up
and
said
as
much
now
to
i
may
be
blamed
for
bringing
him
among
you
but
trust
me
if
things
are
really
as
bad
as
they
seem
i
ll
get
him
off
again
i
ll
not
let
myself
be
bowled
by
such
a
silly
lob
as
that
trust
me
to
devote
profound
thought
to
this
we
all
have
every
confidence
in
you
he
assured
me
but
don
t
be
too
severe
all
at
once
with
the
chap
he
might
recover
a
sane
balance
even
i
shall
use
discretion
i
assured
him
but
if
it
proves
that
i
have
fluffed
my
catch
rely
upon
me
to
use
extreme
red
gap
needs
your
best
effort
he
replied
in
a
voice
that
brimmed
with
feeling
at
my
rush
being
over
i
repaired
to
the
neighbourhood
where
the
honourable
george
had
been
reported
the
stockade
now
contained
only
a
of
the
untaught
horses
but
across
the
road
from
it
was
a
public
house
or
saloon
from
which
came
unmistakable
sounds
of
carousing
it
was
an
unsavoury
place
frequented
only
by
cattle
and
horse
persons
the
proprietor
being
an
abandoned
character
named
spilmer
who
had
once
done
a
patron
to
death
in
a
drunken
quarrel
only
slight
legal
difficulties
had
been
made
for
him
however
it
having
been
pleaded
that
he
acted
in
and
the
creature
had
at
once
resumed
his
trade
as
publican
there
was
even
public
sympathy
for
him
at
the
time
on
the
ground
that
he
possessed
a
blind
mother
though
i
have
never
been
able
to
see
that
this
should
have
been
a
factor
in
adjudging
him
i
paused
now
before
the
low
place
imagining
i
could
detect
the
tones
of
the
honourable
george
high
above
the
chorus
that
came
out
to
me
deciding
that
in
any
event
it
would
not
become
me
to
enter
a
resort
of
this
stamp
i
walked
slowly
back
toward
the
more
reputable
part
of
town
and
was
presently
rewarded
by
seeing
the
crowd
emerge
it
was
led
i
saw
by
the
honourable
george
the
was
still
down
upon
his
ears
and
to
my
horror
he
had
come
upon
the
public
thoroughfare
with
his
legs
encased
in
the
chapps
a
species
of
leathern
pantalettes
covered
with
goat
s
wool
a
garment
which
i
need
not
say
no
gentleman
should
be
seen
abroad
in
as
worn
by
the
in
their
daily
toil
they
are
only
just
possible
being
as
far
from
true
vogue
as
anything
well
could
be
accompanying
him
were
cousin
egbert
the
indian
tuttle
the
hank
and
buck
and
three
or
four
others
of
the
same
rough
stamp
unobtrusively
i
followed
them
to
our
main
thoroughfare
deeply
humiliated
by
the
atrocious
spectacle
the
honourable
george
was
making
of
himself
only
to
observe
them
turn
into
another
public
house
entitled
the
family
liquor
store
where
it
seemed
only
too
certain
since
the
bearing
of
all
was
highly
animated
that
they
would
again
carouse
at
once
seeing
my
duty
i
boldly
entered
finding
them
aligned
against
the
american
bar
and
clamouring
for
drink
my
welcome
was
heartfelt
even
enthusiastic
almost
every
one
of
them
beginning
to
regale
me
with
incidents
of
the
afternoon
s
the
honourable
george
it
seemed
had
himself
briefly
mounted
one
of
the
animals
having
fallen
into
the
belief
that
the
did
not
try
earnestly
enough
to
stay
on
their
mounts
i
gathered
that
one
experience
had
dissuaded
him
from
this
opinion
that
there
little
paint
horse
observed
cousin
egbert
genially
stepped
out
from
under
the
judge
the
prettiest
you
ever
he
sure
did
remarked
the
honourable
george
with
a
palpable
effort
to
speak
the
american
brogue
a
most
flighty
beast
he
was
nerves
all
gone
i
dare
say
a
hopeless
and
then
when
i
would
have
rebuked
him
for
so
shamefully
disappointing
the
ladies
of
the
onwards
and
upwards
society
he
began
to
tell
me
of
the
public
house
he
had
just
left
i
say
you
know
that
spilmer
chap
he
s
a
genuine
murderer
he
let
me
hold
the
weapon
with
which
he
did
it
and
he
has
blind
relatives
dependent
upon
him
or
something
of
that
sort
otherwise
i
fancy
they
d
have
sent
him
to
the
gallows
and
by
gad
he
s
a
witty
scoundrel
what
looking
at
his
sign
leaving
the
settlement
it
reads
last
chance
but
entering
the
settlement
it
reads
first
last
chance
and
first
chance
for
a
peg
do
you
see
what
i
mean
i
tried
it
out
walked
both
ways
under
the
sign
and
looked
up
it
worked
perfectly
enter
the
settlement
first
chance
leave
the
settlement
last
do
you
see
what
i
mean
suggestive
what
witty
you
d
never
have
expected
that
to
be
so
subtle
our
own
murderers
aren
t
that
way
i
say
it
s
a
tremendous
wheeze
i
wonder
the
don
t
take
it
up
it
s
better
than
the
blind
factory
though
the
chap
s
mother
or
something
is
blind
what
ho
but
that
s
silly
to
be
sure
one
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
other
i
say
have
another
you
chaps
i
ve
not
felt
so
fit
in
ages
i
m
going
to
take
up
america
plainly
it
was
no
occasion
to
use
serious
words
to
the
man
he
slapped
his
companions
smartly
on
their
backs
and
was
slapped
in
turn
by
all
of
them
one
or
two
of
them
called
him
an
old
horse
not
only
was
i
doing
no
good
for
the
north
side
set
but
i
had
felt
obliged
to
consume
two
glasses
of
spirits
that
i
did
not
wish
so
i
discreetly
withdrew
as
i
went
the
honourable
george
was
again
telling
them
that
he
was
going
in
for
north
america
and
cousin
egbert
was
calling
three
rousing
cheers
thus
luridly
began
i
may
say
a
scandal
that
was
to
be
in
its
dreadful
effects
far
from
feeling
a
proper
shame
on
the
following
day
the
honourable
george
was
as
pleased
as
punch
with
himself
declaring
his
intention
of
again
consorting
with
the
cattle
and
horse
persons
and
very
definitely
declining
an
invitation
to
play
at
golf
with
golf
he
spluttered
you
do
it
and
then
you
ve
directly
to
do
it
all
over
again
i
mean
to
say
one
gets
nowhere
a
silly
game
what
wishing
to
be
in
no
manner
held
responsible
for
his
vicious
pursuits
i
that
day
removed
my
diggings
from
the
floud
home
to
chambers
in
the
pettengill
block
above
the
grill
where
i
did
myself
quite
nicely
with
decent
mantel
ornaments
some
vivacious
prints
of
cathedrals
and
a
few
good
books
having
for
one
of
the
hobbs
lads
who
seemed
rather
teachable
i
must
admit
however
that
i
was
frequently
obliged
to
address
him
more
sharply
than
one
should
ever
address
one
s
servant
my
theory
having
always
been
that
a
serving
person
should
be
treated
quite
as
if
he
were
a
gentleman
temporarily
performing
menial
duties
but
there
was
that
strain
of
lowness
in
all
the
hobbses
which
often
forbade
this
a
blending
of
servility
with
more
or
less
skilfully
dissembled
impertinence
which
i
dare
say
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
our
serving
people
removed
now
from
the
immediate
and
more
intimate
effects
of
the
honourable
george
s
digressions
i
was
privileged
for
days
at
a
time
to
devote
my
attention
exclusively
to
my
enterprise
it
had
thriven
from
the
beginning
and
after
a
month
i
had
so
perfected
the
minor
details
of
management
that
everything
was
right
as
rain
in
my
catering
i
continued
to
steer
a
middle
course
between
the
british
school
of
plain
roast
and
boiled
and
a
too
often
piffling
french
complexity
seeking
to
retain
the
desirable
features
of
each
my
luncheons
for
the
tradesmen
rather
held
to
a
cut
from
the
joint
with
vegetables
and
a
suitable
sweet
while
in
my
dinners
i
relaxed
a
bit
into
somewhat
imaginative
salads
and
entr√©es
for
the
i
constantly
strove
to
provide
some
appetizing
novelty
often
i
confess
sacrificing
nutrition
to
mere
sightliness
in
view
of
my
almost
exclusive
feminine
patronage
yet
never
carrying
this
to
an
undignified
extreme
as
a
result
of
my
sound
judgment
in
red
gap
began
that
winter
to
be
done
almost
entirely
in
my
place
there
might
be
small
informal
affairs
at
home
but
for
dinners
of
any
pretension
the
hostesses
of
the
north
side
set
came
to
me
relying
almost
quite
entirely
upon
my
taste
in
the
selection
of
the
menu
although
at
first
i
was
required
to
employ
unlimited
tact
in
dissuading
them
from
strange
and
laboured
concoctions
whose
photographs
they
fetched
me
from
their
women
s
magazines
i
at
length
converted
them
from
this
unwholesome
striving
for
novelty
and
laid
the
foundations
for
that
sound
scheme
of
gastronomy
which
distinguishes
this
town
in
the
state
if
not
in
the
west
of
america
it
was
during
these
early
months
i
ought
perhaps
to
say
that
i
rather
distinguished
myself
in
the
matter
of
a
relish
which
i
compounded
one
day
when
there
was
a
cold
round
of
beef
for
luncheon
little
dreaming
of
the
magnitude
of
the
moment
i
brought
together
english
mustard
and
the
american
tomato
catsup
in
proportions
which
for
reasons
that
will
be
made
obvious
i
do
not
here
disclose
together
with
three
other
and
lesser
condiments
whose
identity
also
must
remain
a
secret
serving
this
with
my
cold
joint
i
was
rather
amazed
at
the
sensation
it
created
my
patrons
clamoured
for
it
repeatedly
and
a
barrister
wished
me
to
prepare
a
flask
of
it
for
use
in
his
home
the
following
day
it
was
again
demanded
and
other
requests
were
made
for
private
supplies
while
by
the
end
of
the
week
my
relish
had
become
rather
famous
followed
a
suggestion
from
judson
as
she
overlooked
my
preparation
of
it
one
day
from
her
own
task
of
polishing
the
glassware
put
it
on
the
market
said
she
and
at
once
i
felt
the
inspiration
of
her
idea
to
her
i
entrusted
the
formula
i
procured
a
quantity
of
suitable
flasks
while
in
her
own
home
she
compounded
the
stuff
and
filled
them
having
no
mind
to
claim
credit
not
my
own
i
may
now
say
that
this
rather
remarkable
woman
also
evolved
the
idea
of
the
label
including
the
name
which
was
pasted
upon
the
bottles
when
our
product
was
launched
ruggles
international
relish
she
had
named
it
after
a
moment
s
thought
below
was
a
print
of
my
face
taken
from
an
excellent
photographic
portrait
followed
by
a
brief
summary
of
the
article
s
unsurpassed
excellence
together
with
a
list
of
the
viands
for
which
it
was
commended
as
the
international
relish
is
now
a
matter
of
history
the
demand
for
it
having
spread
as
far
east
as
chicago
and
those
places
i
may
add
that
it
was
this
capable
woman
again
who
devised
the
large
placard
for
hoardings
in
which
a
but
glowing
in
evening
dress
rebukes
the
blackamoor
who
has
served
his
dinner
for
not
having
at
once
placed
ruggles
international
relish
upon
the
table
the
genial
annoyance
of
the
diner
and
the
apologetic
concern
of
the
black
are
excellently
depicted
by
the
artist
for
the
original
drawing
of
which
i
paid
a
stiffish
price
to
the
leading
artist
fellow
of
spokane
this
now
adorns
the
wall
of
my
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
had
been
free
during
these
months
from
annoyance
and
chagrin
at
the
manner
in
which
the
honourable
george
was
conducting
himself
in
the
beginning
it
was
hoped
both
by
and
myself
that
he
might
do
no
worse
than
merely
consort
with
the
rougher
element
of
the
town
i
mean
to
say
we
suspected
that
the
apparent
charm
of
the
raffish
might
suffice
to
keep
him
from
any
notorious
alliance
with
the
dreaded
bohemian
set
so
long
as
he
abstained
from
this
he
might
still
be
received
at
our
best
homes
despite
his
regrettable
fondness
for
low
company
even
when
he
brought
the
murderer
spilmer
to
dine
with
him
at
my
place
the
thing
was
condoned
as
a
freakish
grotesquerie
in
one
who
of
unassailable
social
position
might
well
afford
to
stoop
momentarily
i
must
say
that
the
murderer
a
brute
of
husky
voice
and
quite
lacking
a
forehead
conducted
himself
on
this
occasion
with
an
entirely
decent
restraint
of
manner
quite
in
contrast
to
the
honourable
george
who
betrayed
an
expansively
na√Øve
pride
in
his
guest
seeming
to
wish
the
world
to
know
of
the
event
between
them
they
consumed
a
fair
bottle
of
the
relish
indeed
the
honourable
george
was
inordinately
fond
of
this
as
a
result
of
which
he
would
often
come
out
quite
spotty
again
cousin
egbert
was
another
who
became
so
addicted
to
it
that
his
fondness
might
well
have
been
called
a
vice
both
he
and
the
honourable
george
would
drench
quite
every
course
with
the
sauce
and
cousin
egbert
with
that
explicit
directness
which
distinguished
his
character
would
frankly
sop
his
in
it
or
even
sip
it
with
a
as
i
have
intimated
in
spite
of
the
honourable
george
s
affiliations
with
the
of
what
i
may
call
red
gap
s
east
end
he
had
not
yet
publicly
identified
himself
with
the
klondike
woman
and
her
bohemian
set
in
consequence
of
which
let
him
dine
and
wine
a
spilmer
as
he
would
there
was
yet
hope
that
he
would
not
alienate
himself
from
the
north
side
set
at
intervals
during
the
early
months
of
his
sojourn
among
us
he
accepted
dinner
invitations
at
the
grill
from
our
social
leaders
in
fact
after
the
launching
of
the
international
relish
i
know
of
none
that
he
declined
but
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
moved
but
in
this
higher
circle
on
one
occasion
too
he
appeared
in
the
trousers
of
a
of
tweeds
instead
of
his
dress
trousers
and
with
tan
boots
the
trousers
to
be
sure
were
of
a
sombre
hue
but
the
brown
boots
were
quite
too
dreadfully
unmistakable
after
this
i
may
say
that
i
looked
for
anything
and
my
worst
fears
were
soon
confirmed
it
began
as
the
vaguest
sort
of
gossip
the
honourable
george
it
was
said
had
been
a
guest
at
one
of
the
klondike
woman
s
evening
affairs
the
rumour
crystallized
he
had
been
asked
to
meet
the
bohemian
set
at
a
dutch
supper
and
had
gone
he
had
lingered
until
a
late
hour
dancing
the
american
folkdances
for
which
he
had
shown
a
surprising
adaptability
and
conducting
himself
generally
as
the
next
earl
of
brinstead
should
not
have
done
he
had
repeated
his
visit
repairing
to
the
woman
s
house
both
afternoon
and
evening
he
had
become
a
constant
visitor
he
had
spoken
regrettably
of
the
dulness
of
a
meeting
of
the
onwards
and
upwards
society
which
he
had
attended
he
was
in
the
woman
s
toils
with
gossip
of
this
sort
there
was
naturally
much
indignation
and
yet
the
leaders
of
the
north
side
set
were
so
delicately
placed
that
there
was
every
reason
for
concealing
it
they
redoubled
their
attentions
to
the
unfortunate
man
seeking
to
leave
him
not
an
unoccupied
evening
or
afternoon
such
was
the
gravity
of
the
crisis
alone
remained
finely
judicial
the
situation
is
of
the
gravest
character
he
confided
to
me
but
we
must
be
wary
the
day
isn
t
lost
so
long
as
he
doesn
t
appear
publicly
in
the
creature
s
train
for
the
present
we
have
only
unverified
rumour
as
a
man
about
town
may
feel
free
to
consort
with
vicious
companions
and
still
maintain
his
proper
standing
deplore
it
as
all
people
must
under
present
social
conditions
he
is
undoubtedly
free
to
lead
what
is
called
a
double
life
we
can
only
such
was
the
state
of
the
public
mind
be
it
understood
up
to
the
time
of
the
notorious
and
scandalous
defection
of
this
obsessed
creature
an
occasion
which
i
can
not
recall
without
shuddering
and
which
inspired
me
to
a
course
that
was
later
to
have
the
most
inexplicable
and
consequences
theatrical
plays
had
been
numerous
with
us
during
the
season
with
the
natural
result
of
many
suppers
being
given
by
those
who
attended
among
them
the
north
side
leaders
and
frequently
the
klondike
woman
with
her
following
on
several
of
these
occasions
moreover
the
latter
brought
as
supper
guests
certain
representatives
of
the
theatrical
profession
both
male
and
female
she
apparently
having
a
wide
acquaintance
with
such
persons
that
this
sort
of
thing
increased
her
unpopularity
with
the
north
side
set
will
be
understood
when
i
add
that
now
and
then
her
guests
would
be
of
undoubted
respectability
in
their
private
lives
as
theatrical
persons
often
are
and
such
as
our
smartest
hostesses
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
entertain
to
counteract
this
effect
now
broached
to
me
a
plan
of
undoubted
merit
which
was
nothing
less
than
to
hold
an
afternoon
reception
at
his
home
in
honour
of
the
world
s
greatest
pianoforte
artist
who
was
presently
to
give
a
recital
in
red
gap
i
ve
not
met
the
chap
myself
he
began
but
i
knew
his
secretary
and
travelling
companion
quite
well
in
a
happier
day
in
boston
the
recital
here
will
be
saturday
evening
which
means
that
they
will
remain
here
on
sunday
until
the
evening
train
east
i
shall
suggest
to
my
friend
that
his
employer
to
while
away
the
tedium
of
the
sunday
might
care
to
look
in
upon
me
in
the
afternoon
and
meet
a
few
of
our
best
people
nothing
boring
of
course
i
ve
no
doubt
he
will
arrange
it
i
ve
written
him
to
portland
where
they
now
rather
a
card
that
will
be
i
instantly
cried
rather
better
class
than
entertaining
strolling
indeed
the
merit
of
the
proposal
rather
overwhelmed
me
it
would
be
dignified
and
yet
spectacular
it
would
show
the
klondike
woman
that
we
chose
to
have
contact
only
with
artists
of
acknowledged
pre√´minence
and
that
such
were
quite
willing
to
accept
our
courtesies
i
had
hopes
too
that
the
honourable
george
might
be
aroused
to
advantages
which
he
seemed
bent
upon
casting
to
the
american
winds
a
week
later
joyously
informed
me
that
the
great
artist
had
consented
to
accept
his
hospitality
there
would
be
light
refreshments
with
which
i
was
charged
i
suggested
tea
in
the
russian
manner
which
he
applauded
and
everything
dainty
in
the
way
of
food
he
warned
me
nothing
common
nothing
heavy
some
of
those
tiny
lettuce
sandwiches
a
bit
of
caviare
macaroons
nothing
gross
a
decanter
of
dry
sherry
perhaps
a
few
of
the
lightest
wafers
things
that
cultivated
persons
may
trifle
with
things
not
repugnant
to
the
artist
i
promised
my
profoundest
consideration
to
these
matters
and
it
occurs
to
me
he
thoughtfully
added
that
this
may
be
a
time
for
to
silence
the
slurs
upon
himself
that
are
becoming
so
common
i
shall
beg
him
to
meet
our
guest
at
his
hotel
and
escort
him
to
my
place
a
note
to
my
friend
the
bearer
the
honourable
george
augustus
brother
of
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
will
take
great
pleasure
in
escorting
to
my
home
you
get
the
idea
not
bad
again
i
applauded
resolving
that
for
once
the
honourable
george
would
be
suitably
attired
even
if
i
had
to
bully
him
and
so
was
launched
what
promised
to
be
red
gap
s
most
notable
social
event
of
the
season
the
honourable
george
being
consulted
promised
after
a
rather
sulky
hesitation
to
act
as
the
great
artist
s
escort
though
he
persisted
in
referring
to
him
as
that
piano
johnny
and
betrayed
a
suspicion
that
was
merely
bent
upon
getting
him
to
perform
without
price
but
no
cried
i
should
never
think
of
anything
so
indelicate
as
asking
him
to
play
my
own
piano
will
be
tightly
closed
and
i
dare
say
removed
to
another
at
this
the
honourable
george
professed
to
wonder
why
the
chap
was
desired
if
he
wasn
t
to
perform
all
hair
and
bad
english
silly
brutes
when
they
don
t
play
he
declared
in
the
end
however
as
i
have
said
he
consented
to
act
as
he
was
wished
to
cousin
egbert
who
was
present
at
this
interview
took
somewhat
the
same
view
as
the
honourable
george
even
asserting
that
he
should
not
attend
the
recital
he
don
t
sing
he
don
t
dance
he
don
t
recite
just
plays
the
piano
that
ain
t
any
kind
of
a
show
for
folks
to
set
up
a
whole
evening
for
he
protested
bitterly
and
he
went
on
to
mention
various
theatrical
pieces
which
he
had
considered
worthy
among
them
i
recall
being
one
entitled
the
two
johns
which
he
regretted
not
having
witnessed
for
several
years
and
another
called
ben
hur
which
was
better
than
all
the
piano
players
alive
he
declared
but
with
the
honourable
george
enlisted
both
and
i
considered
the
opinions
of
cousin
egbert
to
be
quite
wholly
negligible
saturday
s
in
its
advance
notice
of
the
recital
announced
that
the
of
boston
and
red
gap
would
entertain
the
artist
on
the
following
afternoon
at
their
palatial
home
in
the
pettengill
addition
where
a
select
few
of
the
north
side
set
had
been
invited
to
meet
him
himself
was
as
a
man
uplifted
he
constantly
revised
and
his
invitation
list
he
sought
me
out
each
day
to
suggest
subtle
changes
in
the
very
artistic
menu
i
had
prepared
for
the
affair
his
last
touch
was
to
supplement
the
decanter
of
sherry
with
a
bottle
of
vodka
about
the
caviare
he
worried
quite
fearfully
until
it
proved
upon
arrival
to
be
fresh
and
of
prime
quality
my
man
the
hobbs
boy
had
under
my
instructions
pressed
and
smarted
the
honourable
george
s
suit
for
afternoon
wear
the
carriage
was
engaged
saturday
night
it
was
tremendously
certain
that
no
hitch
could
occur
to
mar
the
affair
we
had
left
no
detail
to
chance
the
recital
itself
was
quite
all
that
could
have
been
expected
but
underneath
the
enthusiastic
applause
there
ran
even
a
more
intense
fervour
among
those
fortunate
ones
who
were
to
meet
the
artist
on
the
morrow
knew
himself
to
be
a
hero
he
was
elaborately
cool
he
smiled
tolerantly
at
intervals
and
undoubtedly
applauded
with
the
least
hint
of
languid
proprietorship
in
his
manner
he
was
heard
to
speak
of
the
artist
by
his
first
name
the
klondike
woman
and
many
of
her
bohemian
set
were
prominently
among
those
present
and
sustained
glances
of
pitying
triumph
from
those
members
of
the
north
side
set
so
soon
to
be
distinguished
above
her
the
morrow
dawned
auspiciously
very
cloudy
with
smartish
drives
of
wind
and
rain
confined
to
the
dingy
squalor
of
his
hotel
how
gladly
would
the
artist
it
was
felt
seek
the
refined
cheer
of
one
of
our
best
homes
where
he
would
be
enlivened
by
an
hour
or
so
of
contact
with
our
most
cultivated
people
telephoned
me
with
increasing
frequency
as
the
hour
drew
near
nervously
seeming
to
dread
that
i
would
have
overlooked
some
detail
of
his
refined
refreshments
or
that
i
would
not
have
them
at
his
house
on
time
he
telephoned
often
to
the
honourable
george
to
be
assured
that
the
carriage
with
its
escort
would
be
prompt
he
telephoned
repeatedly
to
the
driver
chap
to
impress
upon
him
the
importance
of
his
mission
his
guests
began
to
arrive
even
before
i
had
decked
his
sideboard
with
what
was
i
have
no
hesitation
in
declaring
the
most
superbly
dainty
buffet
collation
that
red
gap
had
ever
beheld
the
atmosphere
at
once
became
tense
with
expectation
at
three
o
clock
the
host
announced
from
the
telephone
has
started
from
the
floud
the
guests
thrilled
and
hushed
the
careless
chatter
of
new
arrivals
remained
heroically
at
the
telephone
having
demanded
to
be
put
through
to
the
hotel
he
was
flushed
with
excitement
a
score
of
minutes
later
he
announced
with
an
effort
to
control
his
voice
they
have
left
the
hotel
they
are
on
the
the
guests
stiffened
in
their
seats
some
of
them
nervously
and
for
no
apparent
reason
exchanged
chairs
with
others
some
late
arrivals
bustled
in
and
were
immediately
awed
to
the
same
electric
silence
of
waiting
placed
the
sherry
decanter
where
the
vodka
bottle
had
been
and
the
vodka
bottle
where
the
sherry
decanter
had
been
the
effect
is
better
he
remarked
and
went
to
stand
where
he
could
view
the
driveway
the
moments
passed
at
such
crises
which
i
need
not
say
have
been
plentiful
in
my
life
i
have
always
known
that
i
possessed
an
immense
reserve
of
coolness
seldom
have
i
ever
been
so
much
as
slightly
flustered
now
i
was
calmness
itself
and
the
knowledge
brought
me
no
little
satisfaction
as
i
noted
the
rather
painful
distraction
of
our
host
the
moments
passed
long
heavy
silent
moments
our
host
ascended
trippingly
to
an
upper
floor
whence
he
could
see
farther
down
the
drive
the
guests
held
themselves
in
smiling
readiness
our
host
descended
and
again
took
up
his
post
at
a
lower
window
the
moments
passed
stilled
leaden
moments
the
silence
had
become
intolerable
our
host
jiggled
on
his
feet
some
of
the
guests
made
a
pretence
of
little
conversational
flurries
that
second
movement
oh
exquisitely
rendered
no
one
has
ever
read
chopin
so
divinely
how
his
family
must
idolize
him
they
say
that
exquisite
concerto
hasn
t
he
the
most
stunning
hair
those
staccato
passages
left
me
actually
limp
i
m
starting
myrtle
in
tuesday
to
take
of
professor
gluckstein
she
wants
to
take
stenography
but
i
tell
her
did
you
think
the
preludes
were
just
the
tiniest
bit
idealized
i
always
say
if
one
has
one
s
music
and
one
s
books
of
course
he
must
be
very
fond
of
music
such
were
the
hushed
tentative
fragments
i
caught
the
moments
passed
went
to
the
telephone
what
but
they
re
not
here
very
strange
they
should
have
been
here
half
an
hour
ago
send
some
one
yes
at
in
the
ensuing
silence
he
repaired
to
the
buffet
and
drank
a
glass
of
vodka
quite
distraught
he
was
the
moments
passed
again
several
guests
exchanged
seats
with
other
guests
it
seemed
to
be
a
device
for
relieving
the
strain
once
more
there
were
scattering
efforts
at
normal
talk
myrtle
is
a
strange
girl
a
creature
of
moods
i
call
her
she
wanted
to
act
in
the
moving
pictures
until
papa
bought
the
car
and
she
knows
every
one
of
the
new
tango
steps
but
i
tell
her
a
few
lessons
in
cooking
wouldn
t
beryl
mae
is
just
the
same
puzzling
child
one
thing
one
day
and
another
thing
the
next
a
mere
bundle
of
nerves
and
so
sensitive
if
you
say
the
least
little
thing
to
her
if
we
could
only
get
ling
wong
back
this
jap
boy
is
always
threatening
to
leave
if
the
men
don
t
get
up
to
breakfast
on
time
or
if
gertie
makes
fudge
in
his
kitchen
of
an
afternoon
our
boy
sends
all
his
wages
to
his
uncle
in
china
but
i
simply
can
t
get
him
to
say
dinner
is
he
just
slides
in
and
says
all
right
you
come
it
s
very
annoying
but
i
always
tell
the
family
remember
what
a
time
we
had
with
the
swede
i
mean
to
say
things
were
becoming
rapidly
impossible
the
moments
passed
again
telephoned
you
did
send
a
man
after
them
send
some
one
after
him
then
yes
at
once
he
poured
himself
another
peg
of
the
vodka
silence
fell
again
the
waiting
was
terrific
we
had
endured
an
hour
of
it
and
but
little
more
was
possible
to
any
sensitive
human
organism
all
at
once
as
if
the
very
last
possible
moment
of
silence
had
passed
the
conversation
broke
loudly
and
generally
and
did
you
notice
that
slimpsy
thing
she
wore
last
night
indecent
if
you
ask
me
with
not
a
petticoat
under
it
i
ll
be
bound
always
wears
shoes
twice
too
small
for
her
what
men
can
see
in
her
how
they
can
endure
that
perpetual
smirk
they
were
at
last
discussing
the
klondike
woman
and
whatever
had
befallen
our
guest
of
honour
i
knew
that
those
present
would
never
regain
their
first
awe
of
the
occasion
it
was
now
unrestrained
gabble
the
second
hour
passed
quickly
enough
the
latter
half
of
it
being
enlivened
by
the
buffet
collation
which
elicited
many
compliments
upon
my
ingenuity
and
good
taste
quite
almost
every
guest
partook
of
a
glass
of
the
vodka
they
chattered
of
everything
but
music
i
dare
say
it
being
thought
graceful
to
ignore
the
afternoon
s
disaster
had
sunk
into
a
mood
of
sullen
desperation
he
drained
the
vodka
bottle
perhaps
the
liquor
brought
him
something
of
the
chill
russian
fatalism
he
was
dignified
but
sodden
with
a
depression
that
seemed
to
blow
from
the
bleak
siberian
steppes
his
wife
was
already
receiving
the
adieus
of
their
guests
she
was
smouldering
ominously
uncertain
where
the
blame
lay
but
certain
there
was
blame
criminal
blame
i
could
read
as
much
in
her
narrowed
eyes
as
she
tried
for
aplomb
with
her
guests
my
own
leave
i
took
unobtrusively
i
knew
our
strangely
missing
guest
was
to
depart
by
the
train
and
i
strolled
toward
the
station
a
block
away
i
halted
waiting
it
had
been
a
time
of
waiting
the
moments
passed
i
heard
the
whistle
of
the
approaching
train
at
the
same
moment
i
was
startled
by
the
approach
of
a
team
that
i
took
to
be
running
away
i
saw
it
was
the
carriage
of
the
pierce
chap
and
that
he
was
driving
with
the
most
abandoned
recklessness
his
passengers
were
the
honourable
george
cousin
egbert
and
our
missing
guest
the
great
artist
as
they
passed
me
seemed
to
feel
a
vast
delight
in
his
wild
ride
he
was
cheering
on
the
driver
he
waved
his
arms
and
himself
shouted
to
the
maddened
horses
the
carriage
drew
up
to
the
station
with
the
train
and
the
three
descended
the
artist
hurriedly
shook
hands
in
the
warmest
manner
with
his
companions
including
the
pierce
chap
who
had
driven
them
he
beckoned
to
his
secretary
who
was
waiting
with
his
bags
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
coach
and
as
the
train
pulled
out
he
waved
frantically
to
the
three
he
kissed
his
hand
to
them
looking
far
out
as
the
train
gathered
momentum
again
and
again
he
kissed
his
hand
to
the
trio
it
was
too
much
the
strain
of
the
afternoon
had
told
even
upon
my
own
iron
nerves
i
felt
unequal
at
that
moment
to
the
simplest
inquiry
and
plainly
the
situation
was
not
one
to
attack
in
haste
i
mean
to
say
it
was
too
pregnant
with
meaning
i
withdrew
rapidly
from
the
scene
feeling
the
need
for
rest
and
silence
as
i
walked
i
meditated
profoundly
chapter
sixteen
from
the
innocent
lips
of
cousin
egbert
the
following
morning
there
fell
a
tale
of
such
depravity
that
i
found
myself
with
difficulty
giving
it
credit
at
ten
o
clock
while
i
still
mused
pensively
over
the
events
of
the
previous
day
he
entered
the
grill
in
search
of
breakfast
as
had
lately
become
his
habit
i
greeted
him
with
perceptible
restraint
not
knowing
what
guilt
might
be
his
but
his
manner
to
me
was
so
unconsciously
genial
that
i
at
once
acquitted
him
of
any
complicity
in
whatever
base
doings
had
been
forward
he
took
his
accustomed
seat
with
a
pleasant
word
to
me
i
waited
feeling
a
mite
off
this
morning
he
began
account
of
a
lot
of
truck
i
eat
yesterday
i
guess
i
ll
just
take
something
kind
of
dainty
tell
clarice
to
cook
me
up
a
nice
little
steak
with
plenty
of
fat
on
it
and
some
fried
potatoes
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
few
waffles
to
come
the
judge
he
wouldn
t
get
up
yet
he
looked
kind
of
mottled
and
anguished
but
i
guess
he
ll
pull
around
all
right
i
had
the
chink
take
him
up
about
a
gallon
of
strong
tea
say
listen
here
the
judge
ain
t
so
awful
much
of
a
stayer
is
he
burning
with
curiosity
i
was
to
learn
what
he
could
tell
me
of
the
day
before
yet
i
controlled
myself
to
the
calmest
of
leisurely
questioning
in
order
not
to
alarm
him
it
was
too
plain
that
he
had
no
realization
of
what
had
occurred
it
was
always
the
way
with
him
i
had
noticed
events
the
most
momentous
might
culminate
furiously
about
his
head
but
he
never
knew
that
anything
had
happened
the
honourable
george
i
began
was
with
you
yesterday
perhaps
he
ate
something
he
shouldn
he
did
he
did
he
done
it
repeatedly
he
et
pretty
near
as
much
of
that
sauerkraut
and
frankfurters
as
the
piano
guy
himself
did
and
that
s
some
tribute
believe
me
bill
some
tribute
the
piano
guy
i
murmured
quite
casually
and
say
listen
here
that
guy
is
all
right
if
anybody
should
ask
you
you
talk
about
your
mixers
this
was
a
bit
puzzling
for
of
course
i
had
never
talked
about
my
i
shouldn
t
a
bit
know
how
to
go
on
i
ventured
another
query
where
was
it
this
mixing
and
that
sort
of
thing
took
place
why
up
at
mis
kenner
s
where
we
was
having
a
little
party
frankfurters
and
sauerkraut
and
beer
my
stars
but
that
steak
looks
good
i
m
feeling
better
his
food
was
before
him
and
he
attacked
it
with
no
end
of
spirit
tell
me
quite
all
about
it
i
amiably
suggested
and
after
a
moment
s
hurried
devotion
to
the
steak
he
slowed
up
a
bit
to
talk
well
listen
here
now
the
judge
says
to
me
when
eddie
pierce
comes
he
says
look
in
at
mis
kenner
s
this
afternoon
if
you
got
nothing
else
on
i
fancy
it
will
repay
just
like
that
well
i
says
all
right
judge
i
fancy
i
will
i
fancy
i
ain
t
got
anything
else
on
i
says
and
i
m
always
glad
to
go
there
i
says
because
no
matter
what
they
re
always
saying
about
this
here
bohemian
stuff
kate
kenner
is
one
good
scout
take
it
from
me
so
in
a
little
while
i
slicked
up
some
and
went
on
around
to
her
house
then
hitched
outside
i
seen
eddie
pierce
s
hack
and
i
says
my
lands
that
s
a
funny
thing
i
says
i
thought
the
judge
was
going
to
haul
this
here
piano
guy
out
to
the
jackson
place
where
he
could
while
away
the
tejum
like
jackson
said
and
now
it
looks
as
if
they
was
here
or
mebbe
it
s
just
eddie
himself
that
has
fancied
to
look
in
not
having
anything
else
well
so
anyway
i
go
up
on
the
stoop
and
knock
and
when
i
get
in
the
parlour
there
the
piano
guy
is
and
the
judge
and
eddie
pierce
too
eddie
helping
the
jap
around
with
frankfurters
and
sauerkraut
and
beer
and
one
thing
and
another
besides
them
was
about
a
dozen
of
mis
kenner
s
own
particular
friends
all
of
em
good
scouts
let
me
tell
you
and
everybody
laughing
and
gassing
back
and
forth
and
cutting
up
and
having
a
good
time
all
around
well
so
as
soon
as
they
seen
me
everybody
says
oh
here
comes
good
old
and
all
like
that
and
they
introduced
me
to
the
piano
guy
who
gets
up
to
shake
hands
with
me
and
spills
his
beer
off
the
chair
arm
on
to
the
wife
of
eddie
fosdick
in
the
farmers
and
merchants
national
and
so
i
sat
down
and
et
with
em
and
had
a
few
steins
of
beer
and
everybody
had
a
good
time
all
the
wonderful
man
appeared
to
believe
that
he
had
told
me
quite
all
of
interest
concerning
this
monstrous
festivity
he
surveyed
the
mutilated
remnant
of
his
steak
and
said
i
guess
clarice
might
as
well
fry
me
a
few
eggs
i
m
feeling
a
lot
i
directed
that
this
be
done
musing
upon
the
dreadful
menu
he
had
recited
and
recalling
the
exquisite
finish
of
the
collation
i
myself
had
prepared
sausages
to
be
sure
have
their
place
and
beer
as
well
but
sauerkraut
i
have
never
been
able
to
regard
as
an
at
all
possible
food
for
persons
that
really
matter
germans
to
be
sure
discreetly
i
renewed
my
inquiry
i
dare
say
the
honourable
george
was
in
good
form
i
suggested
well
he
et
a
lot
him
and
the
piano
guy
was
bragging
which
could
eat
the
most
i
was
unable
to
restrain
a
shudder
at
the
thought
of
this
revolting
contest
the
piano
guy
beat
him
out
though
he
d
been
at
the
palace
hotel
for
three
meals
and
i
guess
his
appetite
was
right
and
afterward
well
it
was
like
jackson
said
this
lad
wanted
to
while
away
the
tejum
of
a
sunday
afternoon
and
so
he
whiled
it
that
s
all
purty
soon
mis
kenner
set
down
to
the
piano
and
sung
some
coon
songs
that
tickled
him
most
to
death
and
then
she
got
to
playing
ragtime
say
believe
me
bill
when
she
starts
in
on
that
rag
stuff
she
can
make
a
piano
simply
stutter
itself
to
death
illustration
mis
kenner
set
down
to
the
piano
and
sung
some
coon
songs
that
tickled
him
most
to
death
well
at
that
the
piano
guy
says
it
s
great
stuff
and
so
he
sets
down
himself
to
try
it
and
he
catches
on
pretty
good
i
ll
say
that
for
him
so
we
got
to
dancing
while
he
plays
for
us
only
he
don
t
remember
the
tunes
good
and
has
to
fake
a
lot
then
he
makes
mis
kenner
play
again
while
he
dances
with
mis
fosdick
that
he
spilled
the
beer
on
and
after
that
we
had
some
more
beer
and
this
guy
et
another
plate
of
kraut
and
a
few
sausages
and
mis
kenner
sings
the
robert
lee
and
a
couple
more
good
ones
and
the
guy
played
some
more
ragtime
himself
trying
to
get
the
tunes
right
and
then
he
played
some
fancy
pieces
that
he
d
practised
up
on
and
we
danced
some
and
had
a
few
more
beers
with
everybody
laughing
and
cutting
up
and
having
a
nice
home
afternoon
well
the
piano
guy
enjoyed
himself
every
minute
if
anybody
asks
you
being
lit
up
like
a
main
chandelier
they
made
him
feel
like
he
was
one
of
their
own
folks
you
certainly
got
to
hand
it
to
him
for
being
one
little
good
mixer
talk
about
whiling
away
the
tejum
he
done
it
all
right
all
right
he
whiled
away
so
much
tejum
there
he
darned
near
missed
his
train
eddie
pierce
kept
telling
him
what
time
it
was
only
he
d
keep
asking
mis
kenner
to
play
just
one
more
rag
and
at
last
we
had
to
just
shoot
him
into
his
fur
overcoat
while
he
was
kissing
all
the
women
on
their
hands
and
we
d
have
missed
the
train
at
that
if
eddie
hadn
t
poured
the
leather
into
them
skates
of
his
all
the
way
down
to
the
he
just
did
make
it
and
he
told
the
judge
and
eddie
and
me
that
he
ain
t
had
such
a
good
time
since
he
left
home
i
kind
of
hated
to
see
him
he
here
attacked
the
eggs
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
freshening
of
his
remarkable
appetite
and
as
yet
be
it
noted
i
had
detected
no
consciousness
on
his
part
that
a
foul
betrayal
of
confidence
had
been
committed
i
approached
the
point
the
were
rather
expecting
him
you
know
my
impression
was
that
the
honourable
george
had
been
sent
to
escort
him
to
the
well
that
s
what
i
thought
too
but
i
guess
the
judge
forgot
it
or
mebbe
he
thinks
the
guy
will
mix
in
better
with
mis
kenner
s
crowd
anyway
there
they
was
and
it
probably
didn
t
make
any
difference
to
the
guy
himself
he
likely
thought
he
could
while
away
the
tejum
there
as
well
as
he
could
while
it
any
place
all
of
them
being
such
good
scouts
and
the
judge
has
certainly
got
a
case
on
mis
kenner
so
mebby
she
asked
him
to
drop
in
with
any
friend
of
his
she
s
got
him
and
broke
to
all
he
visibly
groped
for
an
illumining
phrase
he
he
just
looks
at
the
simple
words
fell
upon
my
ears
with
a
sickening
finality
he
just
looks
at
i
had
seen
him
just
look
at
the
and
at
the
brixton
milliner
all
too
fearfully
i
divined
their
preposterous
significance
beyond
question
a
black
infamy
had
been
laid
bare
but
i
made
no
effort
to
convey
its
magnitude
to
my
guileless
informant
as
i
left
him
he
was
mildly
bemoaning
his
own
lack
of
skill
on
the
pianoforte
darned
if
i
don
t
wish
i
d
a
took
some
lessons
on
the
piano
myself
like
that
guy
done
it
certainly
does
help
to
while
away
the
tejum
when
you
got
friends
in
for
the
afternoon
but
then
i
was
just
a
likely
i
couldn
t
have
learned
the
notes
it
was
a
later
that
i
was
called
to
the
telephone
to
listen
to
the
anguished
accents
of
have
you
heard
it
he
called
i
answered
that
i
had
the
man
is
a
paranoiac
he
should
be
at
once
confined
in
an
asylum
for
the
criminal
i
shall
row
him
fiercely
about
it
never
fear
i
ve
not
seen
him
but
the
creature
should
be
watched
he
may
do
harm
to
himself
or
to
some
innocent
person
they
they
run
wild
they
kill
they
burn
set
fire
to
buildings
that
sort
of
thing
i
tell
you
none
of
us
is
the
situation
i
answered
has
even
more
shocking
possibilities
but
i
ve
an
idea
i
shall
be
equal
to
it
if
the
worst
seems
to
be
imminent
i
shall
adopt
extreme
i
closed
the
interview
it
was
too
painful
i
wished
to
summon
all
my
powers
of
deliberation
to
my
amazement
who
should
presently
appear
among
my
throng
of
luncheon
patrons
but
the
honourable
george
i
will
not
say
that
he
slunk
in
but
there
was
an
unaccustomed
diffidence
in
his
bearing
he
did
not
meet
my
eye
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
perceive
that
he
had
no
wish
to
engage
my
notice
as
he
sought
a
vacant
table
i
observed
that
he
was
spotted
quite
profusely
and
his
luncheon
order
was
of
the
simplest
straight
i
went
to
him
he
winced
a
bit
i
thought
as
he
saw
me
approach
but
then
he
apparently
resolved
to
brass
it
out
for
he
glanced
full
at
me
with
a
terrific
assumption
of
bravado
and
at
once
began
to
give
me
beans
about
my
service
your
bally
tea
shop
running
down
what
louts
for
waiters
cloddish
louts
disgraceful
my
word
slow
beggars
take
a
year
to
do
you
a
rasher
and
a
bit
of
toast
what
to
this
absurd
tirade
i
replied
not
a
word
but
stood
silently
regarding
him
i
dare
say
my
gaze
was
of
the
most
chilling
character
and
steady
he
endured
it
but
a
moment
his
eyes
fell
his
bravado
vanished
he
fumbled
with
the
cutlery
quite
abashed
he
was
come
your
explanation
i
said
curtly
divining
that
the
moment
was
one
in
which
to
adopt
a
tone
with
him
he
wriggled
a
bit
crumpling
a
roll
with
panic
fingers
come
come
i
commanded
his
face
brightened
though
with
an
intention
most
obviously
false
he
coughed
a
cough
of
pure
deception
not
only
were
his
eyes
averted
from
mine
but
they
were
glassed
to
an
uncanny
degree
the
fingers
wrought
piteously
at
the
now
plastic
roll
my
word
the
chap
was
taken
bad
had
to
be
seen
to
what
revived
i
mean
to
say
all
piano
johnnies
that
way
nervous
wrecks
what
spells
spells
man
spells
come
come
i
said
crisply
the
glassed
eyes
were
those
of
one
hypnotized
in
the
carriage
to
the
hyphen
chap
s
place
to
be
sure
fainting
spell
weak
heart
what
no
stimulants
about
passing
house
perhaps
have
stimulants

tablets
er
beer
things
of
that
sort
lead
him
in
revive
him
quite
well
presently
but
not
well
enough
to
go
on
couldn
t
let
a
piano
johnny
die
on
our
hands
what
inquest
evidence
witnesses
all
that
silly
rot
save
his
life
what
presence
of
mind
kind
hearts
what
humanity
do
as
much
for
any
chap
not
let
him
die
like
a
dog
in
the
gutter
what
get
no
credit
though
his
curiously
mechanical
utterance
trailed
off
to
be
lost
in
a
mere
husky
murmur
the
glassy
stare
was
still
at
my
wall
i
have
in
the
course
of
my
eventful
career
had
occasion
to
mark
the
varying
degrees
of
plausibility
with
which
men
speak
untruths
but
never
i
confidently
aver
have
i
beheld
one
lie
with
so
piteous
a
futility
the
art
and
i
dare
say
with
diplomat
chaps
and
that
sort
it
may
properly
be
called
an
art
demands
as
its
very
essence
that
the
speaker
seem
to
be
himself
convinced
of
the
truth
of
that
which
he
utters
and
the
honourable
george
in
his
youth
mentioned
for
the
foreign
office
i
turned
away
the
exhibition
was
quite
too
indecent
i
left
him
to
mince
at
his
meagre
fare
as
i
glanced
his
way
at
odd
moments
thereafter
he
would
be
muttering
feverishly
to
himself
i
mean
to
say
he
no
longer
himself
he
presently
made
his
way
to
the
street
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
he
had
in
truth
the
dazed
manner
of
one
stupefied
by
some
powerful
narcotic
i
wondered
pityingly
when
i
should
again
behold
him
if
it
might
be
that
his
poor
wits
were
bedevilled
past
mending
my
period
of
uncertainty
was
all
too
brief
some
two
hours
later
full
into
the
tide
of
our
afternoon
shopping
throng
there
issued
a
spectacle
that
removed
any
lingering
doubt
of
the
unfortunate
man
s
plight
in
the
rather
smart
of
the
klondike
woman
driven
by
the
person
herself
rode
the
honourable
george
full
in
the
startled
gaze
of
many
of
our
best
people
he
advertised
his
defection
from
all
that
makes
for
a
sanely
governed
stability
in
our
social
organism
he
had
gone
flagrantly
over
to
the
bohemian
set
i
could
detect
that
his
eyes
were
still
glassy
but
his
head
was
erect
he
seemed
to
flaunt
his
shame
and
the
guilty
partner
of
his
downfall
drove
with
an
affectation
of
easy
carelessness
yet
with
a
lift
of
the
chin
which
though
barely
perceptible
had
all
the
effect
of
binding
the
prisoner
to
her
chariot
wheels
a
prisoner
moreover
whom
it
was
plain
she
meant
to
parade
to
the
last
ignominious
degree
she
drove
leisurely
and
in
the
little
infrequent
curt
turns
of
her
head
to
address
her
companion
she
contrived
to
instill
so
finished
an
effect
of
boredom
that
she
must
have
goaded
to
frenzy
any
matron
of
the
north
side
set
who
chanced
to
observe
her
as
more
than
one
of
them
did
thrice
did
she
halt
along
our
main
thoroughfare
for
bits
of
shopping
a
mere
running
into
of
shops
or
to
the
doors
of
them
where
she
could
issue
verbal
orders
the
while
she
surveyed
her
waiting
and
drugged
captive
with
a
certain
but
insolence
at
these
moments
for
i
took
pains
to
overlook
the
shocking
scene
the
honourable
george
followed
her
with
eyes
no
longer
glassed
the
eyes
of
helpless
infatuation
he
looks
at
her
cousin
egbert
had
said
he
had
told
it
all
and
told
it
well
the
equipage
graced
our
street
upon
one
paltry
excuse
or
another
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
the
woman
being
minded
that
none
of
us
should
longer
question
her
supremacy
over
the
next
and
eleventh
earl
of
brinstead
not
for
another
hour
did
the
effects
of
the
sensation
die
out
among
tradesmen
and
the
street
crowds
it
was
like
waves
that
recede
but
gradually
they
talked
they
stopped
to
talk
they
passed
on
talking
they
hissed
vivaciously
they
rose
to
exclamations
i
mean
to
say
there
was
no
end
of
a
gabbling
row
about
it
there
was
in
my
mind
no
longer
any
room
for
hesitation
the
quite
harshest
of
extreme
measures
must
be
at
once
adopted
before
all
was
too
late
i
made
my
way
to
the
telegraph
office
it
was
not
a
time
for
correspondence
by
post
afterward
i
had
myself
put
through
by
telephone
to
with
his
sensitive
nature
he
had
stopped
in
all
day
although
still
averse
to
appearing
publicly
he
now
consented
to
meet
me
at
my
chambers
late
that
evening
the
whole
town
is
seething
with
indignation
he
called
to
me
it
was
disgraceful
i
shall
come
at
ten
we
rely
upon
again
i
saw
that
he
was
concerned
solely
with
his
humiliation
as
a
host
not
yet
had
he
divined
that
the
deluded
honourable
george
might
go
to
the
unspeakable
length
of
a
matrimonial
alliance
with
the
woman
who
had
enchained
him
and
as
to
his
own
disaster
he
was
less
than
accurate
when
he
said
that
the
whole
town
was
seething
with
indignation
the
members
of
the
north
side
set
to
be
sure
were
seething
furiously
but
a
flippant
element
of
the
baser
sort
was
quite
openly
rejoicing
as
at
the
time
of
that
most
slanderous
minstrel
performance
it
was
said
that
the
bohemian
set
had
again
if
i
have
caught
the
phrase
put
a
thing
over
upon
the
north
side
set
many
persons
of
low
taste
seemed
quite
to
enjoy
the
dreadful
affair
and
the
members
of
the
bohemian
set
naturally
throughout
the
day
had
been
quite
coarsely
beside
themselves
with
glee
little
they
knew
i
reflected
what
power
i
could
wield
nor
that
i
had
already
set
in
motion
its
deadly
springs
little
did
the
woman
dream
flaunting
her
triumph
up
and
down
our
main
business
thoroughfare
that
one
who
watched
her
there
had
but
to
raise
his
hand
to
wrest
the
victim
from
her
toils
little
did
she
now
dream
that
he
would
stop
at
no
half
measures
i
mean
to
say
she
would
never
think
i
could
bowl
her
out
as
easy
as
buying
cockles
off
a
barrow
at
the
hour
for
our
conference
arrived
at
my
chambers
muffled
in
an
ulster
and
with
a
soft
hat
well
over
his
face
i
gathered
that
he
had
not
wished
to
be
observed
i
feel
that
this
is
a
crisis
he
began
as
he
gloomily
shook
my
hand
where
is
our
boasted
culture
if
outrages
like
this
are
permitted
for
the
first
time
i
understand
how
these
western
communities
have
in
the
past
resorted
to
mob
violence
public
feeling
is
already
running
high
against
the
creature
and
her
unspeakable
i
met
this
outburst
with
the
serenity
of
one
who
holds
the
winning
cards
in
his
hand
and
begged
him
to
be
seated
thereupon
i
disclosed
to
him
the
weakly
susceptible
nature
of
the
honourable
george
reciting
the
incidents
of
the
and
the
brixton
milliner
i
added
that
now
as
before
i
should
not
hesitate
to
preserve
the
family
honour
a
dreadful
thing
indeed
he
murmured
if
that
adventuress
should
trap
him
into
a
marriage
imagine
her
one
day
a
countess
of
brinstead
but
suppose
the
fellow
prove
stubborn
suppose
his
infatuation
dulls
all
his
finer
instincts
i
explained
that
the
honourable
george
while
he
might
upon
the
spur
of
the
moment
commit
a
folly
was
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
that
he
was
i
believed
quite
incapable
of
a
grand
passion
i
mean
to
say
he
always
forgot
them
after
a
few
days
more
like
a
child
staring
into
he
was
rapidly
forgetting
one
desired
object
in
the
presence
of
others
i
added
that
i
had
adopted
the
extremest
measures
thereupon
perceiving
that
i
had
something
in
my
sleeve
as
the
saying
is
my
caller
besought
me
to
confide
in
him
without
a
word
i
handed
him
a
copy
of
my
cable
message
sent
that
afternoon
to
his
lordship
your
immediate
presence
required
to
prevent
a
monstrous
he
brightened
as
he
read
it
you
actually
mean
to
say
he
began
his
lordship
i
explained
will
at
once
understand
the
nature
of
what
is
threatened
he
knows
moreover
that
i
would
not
alarm
him
without
cause
he
will
come
at
once
and
the
honourable
george
will
be
told
what
his
lordship
has
never
failed
he
tells
him
what
perfectly
and
that
s
quite
all
to
it
the
poor
chap
will
be
my
caller
was
profoundly
stirred
coming
here
to
red
gap
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
actually
coming
here
my
god
this
is
wonderful
he
paused
he
seemed
to
moisten
his
dry
lips
he
began
once
more
and
now
his
voice
trembled
with
emotion
he
will
need
a
place
to
stay
our
hotel
is
impossible
had
you
thought
he
glanced
at
me
appealingly
i
dare
say
i
replied
that
his
lordship
will
be
pleased
to
have
you
put
him
up
you
would
do
him
quite
you
mean
it
seriously
that
would
be
oh
inexpressible
he
would
be
our
house
guest
the
earl
of
brinstead
i
fancy
that
would
silence
a
few
of
these
serpent
tongues
that
are
wagging
so
venomously
but
before
his
coming
i
insisted
there
must
be
no
word
of
his
arrival
the
honourable
george
would
know
the
meaning
of
it
and
the
woman
though
i
suspect
now
that
she
is
only
making
a
show
of
him
might
go
on
to
the
bitter
end
they
must
suspect
i
had
merely
thought
of
a
brief
and
dignified
notice
in
our
press
he
began
quite
wistfully
but
if
you
think
it
might
defeat
our
ends
it
must
wait
until
he
has
glorious
he
exclaimed
it
will
be
even
more
of
a
blow
to
he
began
to
murmur
as
if
reading
from
a
journal
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
is
visiting
for
a
few
days
it
will
surely
be
as
much
as
a
few
days
perhaps
a
week
or
more
is
visiting
for
a
few
days
the
of
boston
and
red
he
seemed
to
regard
the
printed
words
better
still
the
of
boston
and
red
gap
are
for
a
few
days
entertaining
as
their
honoured
house
guest
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
yes
that
s
he
arose
and
impulsively
clasped
my
hand
ruggles
dear
old
chap
i
shan
t
know
at
all
how
to
repay
you
the
bohemian
set
such
as
are
possible
will
be
bound
to
come
over
to
us
there
will
be
left
of
it
but
one
unprincipled
woman
and
she
wretched
and
an
outcast
she
has
made
me
absurd
i
shall
grind
her
under
my
heel
the
east
room
shall
be
prepared
for
his
lordship
he
shall
breakfast
there
if
he
wishes
i
fancy
he
ll
find
us
rather
more
like
himself
than
he
suspects
he
shall
see
that
we
have
ideals
that
are
not
half
he
wrung
my
hand
again
his
eyes
were
misty
with
gratitude
chapter
seventeen
three
days
later
came
the
satisfying
answer
to
my
cable
message
damn
sailing
glad
i
was
he
had
used
the
cable
in
a
letter
there
would
doubtless
have
been
still
other
words
improper
to
a
peer
of
england
thereafter
bore
himself
with
a
dignity
quite
tremendous
even
for
him
graciously
aloof
he
was
as
one
carrying
an
inner
light
we
hold
them
in
the
hollow
of
our
hand
said
he
and
both
his
wife
and
himself
took
pains
on
our
own
thoroughfare
to
cut
the
honourable
george
dead
though
i
dare
say
the
poor
chap
never
at
all
noticed
it
they
spoke
of
him
as
a
remittance
man
the
black
sheep
of
a
noble
family
they
mentioned
sympathetically
the
trouble
his
vicious
ways
had
been
to
his
brother
the
earl
indeed
so
mysteriously
important
were
they
in
allusions
of
this
sort
that
i
was
obliged
to
caution
them
lest
they
let
out
the
truth
as
it
was
there
ran
through
the
town
an
undercurrent
of
puzzled
suspicion
it
was
intimated
that
we
had
something
in
our
sleeves
whether
this
tension
was
felt
by
the
honourable
george
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
i
dare
say
not
as
he
is
being
seldom
aware
of
anything
beyond
his
own
immediate
sensations
but
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
klondike
woman
had
divined
some
menace
in
our
attitude
of
marked
indifference
her
own
manner
when
it
could
be
observed
grew
increasingly
defiant
if
that
were
possible
the
alliance
of
the
honourable
george
with
the
bohemian
set
had
become
of
course
a
public
scandal
after
the
day
of
his
appearance
in
her
trap
and
after
his
betrayal
of
the
had
been
gossiped
to
rags
he
no
longer
troubled
himself
to
pretend
any
esteem
whatever
for
the
north
side
set
scarce
a
day
passed
but
he
appeared
in
public
as
the
woman
s
escort
he
flagrantly
performed
her
commissions
and
at
their
questionable
bohemian
gatherings
with
their
beer
and
sausages
and
that
sort
of
thing
he
was
the
gayest
of
that
gay
mad
set
indeed
of
his
old
associates
cousin
egbert
quite
almost
alone
seemed
to
find
him
any
longer
desirable
and
him
i
had
no
heart
to
caution
knowing
that
i
should
only
wound
without
enlightening
him
he
being
entirely
impervious
to
even
these
cruder
aspects
of
class
distinction
i
dare
say
he
would
have
considered
the
marriage
of
the
honourable
george
as
no
more
than
the
marriage
of
one
of
his
companions
i
mean
to
say
he
is
a
dear
old
sort
and
i
should
never
fail
to
defend
him
in
the
most
disheartening
of
his
vagaries
but
he
is
undeniably
insensitive
to
what
one
does
and
does
not
do
the
conviction
ran
let
me
repeat
that
we
had
another
pot
of
broth
on
the
fire
i
gleaned
as
much
from
the
mixer
she
being
one
of
the
few
others
besides
cousin
egbert
in
whose
liking
the
honourable
george
had
not
terrifically
descended
she
made
it
a
point
to
address
me
on
the
subject
over
a
dish
of
tea
at
the
grill
one
afternoon
choosing
a
table
sufficiently
remote
from
my
other
feminine
guests
who
doubtless
at
their
own
tables
discussed
the
same
complication
i
was
indeed
glad
that
we
were
remote
from
other
occupied
tables
because
in
the
course
of
her
remarks
she
quite
forcefully
uttered
an
oath
which
i
thought
it
as
well
not
to
have
known
that
i
cared
to
tolerate
in
my
lady
patrons
as
to
what
jackson
feels
about
the
way
it
was
handed
out
to
him
that
sunday
she
bluntly
declared
i
don
t
care
a
the
oath
quite
dazed
me
for
a
moment
although
i
had
been
warned
that
she
would
use
language
on
occasion
what
i
do
care
about
she
went
on
briskly
is
that
i
won
t
have
this
girl
pestered
by
jackson
or
by
you
or
by
any
man
that
wears
hair
why
jackson
talks
so
silly
about
her
sometimes
you
d
think
she
was
a
bad
woman
and
he
keeps
hinting
about
something
he
s
going
to
put
over
till
i
can
hardly
keep
my
hands
off
him
i
just
know
some
day
he
ll
make
me
forget
i
m
a
lady
now
take
it
from
me
bill
if
you
re
setting
in
with
him
don
t
start
anything
you
can
t
really
she
was
quite
fierce
about
it
i
mean
to
say
the
glitter
in
her
eyes
made
me
recall
what
cousin
egbert
had
said
of
effie
her
being
quite
entirely
willing
to
take
on
a
rattlesnake
and
give
it
the
advantage
of
the
first
two
assaults
somewhat
flustered
i
was
yet
i
hastened
to
assure
her
that
whatever
steps
i
might
feel
obliged
to
take
for
the
protection
of
the
honourable
george
they
would
involve
nothing
at
all
unfair
to
the
lady
in
question
well
they
better
hadn
t
she
resumed
threateningly
that
girl
had
a
hard
time
all
right
but
listen
here
she
s
as
right
as
a
church
she
couldn
t
fool
me
a
minute
if
she
wasn
t
don
t
you
suppose
i
been
around
and
around
quite
some
just
because
she
likes
to
have
a
good
time
and
outdresses
these
dames
here
is
that
any
reason
they
should
get
out
their
hammers
ain
t
she
earned
some
right
to
a
good
time
tell
me
after
being
married
when
she
was
a
silly
kid
to
kenner
the
swine
and
god
bless
the
trigger
finger
of
the
man
that
bumped
him
off
as
for
the
poor
old
judge
don
t
worry
i
like
the
old
boy
but
kate
kenner
won
t
do
anything
more
than
make
a
monkey
of
him
just
to
spite
jackson
and
his
band
of
lady
knockers
marry
him
say
get
me
right
bill
i
ll
put
it
as
delicate
as
i
can
the
judge
is
too
darned
far
from
being
a
mental
giant
for
i
dare
say
she
would
have
slanged
me
for
another
but
for
the
constant
strain
of
keeping
her
voice
down
as
it
was
she
boomed
up
now
and
again
in
a
way
that
reduced
to
listening
silence
the
ladies
at
several
distant
tables
as
to
the
various
points
she
had
raised
i
was
somewhat
confused
about
the
honourable
george
for
example
he
was
to
be
sure
no
mental
giant
but
one
occupying
his
position
is
not
required
to
be
indeed
in
the
class
to
which
he
was
born
one
well
knows
that
a
mental
giant
would
be
quite
as
distressingly
bizarre
as
any
other
freak
i
regretted
not
having
retorted
this
to
her
for
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
she
had
gone
it
rather
strong
with
her
poor
old
i
mean
to
say
it
was
almost
quite
a
little
bit
raw
for
a
native
american
to
adopt
this
patronizing
tone
toward
one
of
us
and
yet
i
found
that
my
esteem
for
the
mixer
had
increased
rather
than
diminished
by
reason
of
her
plucky
defence
of
the
klondike
woman
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
designing
creature
was
worth
a
defence
but
i
could
only
admire
the
valour
that
made
it
also
i
found
food
for
profound
meditation
in
the
mixer
s
assertion
that
the
woman
s
sole
aim
was
to
make
a
monkey
of
the
honourable
george
if
she
were
right
a
m√©salliance
need
not
be
feared
at
which
thought
i
felt
a
great
relief
that
she
should
achieve
the
lesser
and
perhaps
equally
easy
feat
with
the
poor
chap
was
a
calamity
that
would
be
i
fancied
endured
by
his
lordship
with
a
serene
fortitude
curiously
enough
as
i
went
over
the
mixer
s
tirade
point
by
point
i
found
in
myself
an
inexplicable
loss
of
animus
toward
the
klondike
woman
i
will
not
say
i
was
moved
to
sympathy
for
her
but
doubtless
that
strange
ferment
of
equality
stirred
me
toward
her
with
something
less
than
the
indignation
i
had
formerly
felt
perhaps
she
was
an
entirely
worthy
creature
in
that
case
i
merely
wished
her
to
be
taught
that
one
must
not
look
too
far
above
one
s
station
even
in
america
in
so
serious
an
affair
as
matrimony
with
all
my
heart
i
should
wish
her
a
worthy
mate
of
her
own
class
and
i
was
glad
indeed
to
reflect
upon
the
truth
of
my
assertion
to
the
mixer
that
no
unfair
advantage
would
be
taken
of
her
his
lordship
would
remove
the
honourable
george
from
her
toils
a
made
monkey
perhaps
but
no
husband
again
that
day
did
i
listen
to
a
defence
of
this
woman
and
from
a
source
whence
i
could
little
have
expected
it
meditating
upon
the
matter
i
found
myself
staring
at
judson
as
she
polished
some
glassware
in
the
pantry
as
always
the
worthy
woman
made
a
pleasing
picture
in
her
neat
print
gown
from
staring
at
her
rather
absently
i
caught
myself
reflecting
that
she
was
one
of
the
few
women
whose
hair
is
always
perfectly
coiffed
i
mean
to
say
no
matter
what
the
press
of
her
occupation
it
never
goes
here
and
there
from
the
hair
my
meditative
eye
still
rather
absently
i
believe
descended
her
quite
good
figure
to
her
boots
thereupon
my
gaze
ceased
to
be
absent
they
were
not
boots
they
were
bronzed
slippers
with
high
heels
and
metal
buckles
and
of
a
character
so
distinctive
that
i
instantly
knew
they
had
once
before
been
impressed
upon
my
vision
swiftly
my
mind
identified
them
they
had
been
worn
by
the
klondike
woman
on
the
occasion
of
a
dinner
at
the
grill
in
conjunction
with
a
gown
to
match
and
a
bluish
scarf
all
combining
to
achieve
an
immense
effect
my
assistant
hummed
at
her
task
unconscious
of
my
scrutiny
i
recall
that
i
coughed
slightly
before
disclosing
to
her
that
my
attention
had
been
attracted
to
her
slippers
she
took
the
reference
lightly
affecting
as
the
sex
will
to
belittle
any
prized
possession
in
the
face
of
masculine
praise
i
have
seen
them
before
i
ventured
she
gives
me
all
of
hers
i
haven
t
had
to
buy
shoes
since
baby
was
born
she
gives
me
lots
of
things
stockings
and
things
she
likes
me
to
have
i
didn
t
know
you
knew
years
i
m
there
once
a
week
to
give
the
house
a
good
going
over
that
jap
of
hers
is
the
limit
dust
till
you
can
t
rest
and
when
i
clean
he
just
i
mused
upon
this
the
woman
was
already
giving
half
her
time
to
superintending
two
assistants
in
the
preparation
of
the
international
relish
her
work
is
too
much
in
addition
to
your
own
i
suggested
me
work
too
hard
not
in
a
thousand
years
i
do
all
right
for
you
don
t
i
it
was
true
she
was
anything
but
a
slacker
i
more
nearly
approached
my
real
objection
a
woman
in
your
position
i
began
can
t
be
too
careful
as
to
the
associations
she
forms
i
had
meant
to
go
on
but
found
it
quite
absurdly
impossible
my
assistant
set
down
the
glass
she
had
and
quite
venomously
brandished
her
towel
at
me
so
that
s
it
she
began
and
almost
could
get
no
farther
for
mere
sputtering
i
mean
to
say
i
had
long
recognized
that
she
possessed
character
but
never
had
i
suspected
that
she
would
have
so
inadequate
a
control
of
her
temper
so
that
s
it
she
sputtered
again
and
i
thought
you
were
too
decent
to
join
in
that
talk
about
a
woman
just
because
she
s
young
and
wears
pretty
clothes
and
likes
to
go
out
i
m
astonished
at
you
i
really
am
i
thought
you
were
more
of
a
man
she
broke
off
scowling
at
me
most
furiously
feeling
all
at
once
rather
a
fool
i
sought
to
conciliate
her
i
have
joined
in
no
talk
i
said
i
merely
suggested
but
she
shut
me
off
sharply
and
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
i
can
pick
out
my
associates
in
this
town
without
any
outside
help
the
idea
that
girl
is
just
as
nice
a
person
as
ever
walked
the
earth
and
nobody
ever
said
she
wasn
t
except
those
frumpy
old
cats
that
hate
her
good
looks
because
the
men
all
like
old
cats
i
echoed
wishing
to
rebuke
this
violence
of
epithet
but
she
would
have
none
of
me
nasty
old
she
insisted
with
even
more
violence
and
went
on
to
an
almost
quite
blasphemous
absurdity
a
prince
in
his
palace
wouldn
t
be
any
too
good
for
her
tut
tut
i
said
greatly
shocked
tut
nothing
she
retorted
fiercely
a
regular
prince
in
his
palace
that
s
what
she
deserves
there
isn
t
a
single
man
in
this
town
that
s
good
enough
to
pick
up
her
glove
and
she
knows
it
too
she
s
carrying
on
with
your
silly
englishman
now
but
it
s
just
to
pay
those
old
cats
back
in
their
own
coin
she
ll
carry
on
with
him
yes
but
marry
good
heavens
and
earth
marriage
is
serious
with
this
novel
conclusion
she
seized
another
glass
and
began
to
wipe
it
viciously
she
glared
at
me
seeming
to
believe
that
she
had
closed
the
interview
but
i
couldn
t
stop
in
some
curious
way
she
had
stirred
me
rather
out
of
myself
but
not
about
the
klondike
woman
nor
about
the
honourable
george
i
began
most
illogically
i
admit
to
rage
inwardly
about
another
matter
you
have
other
associates
i
exclaimed
quite
violently
those
i
know
quite
all
about
it
that
hank
and
buck
they
come
here
on
the
chance
of
seeing
you
they
bring
you
boxes
of
candy
they
bring
you
little
presents
twice
they
ve
escorted
you
home
at
night
when
you
quite
well
knew
i
was
only
too
glad
to
do
it
i
felt
my
temper
most
curiously
running
away
with
me
ranting
about
things
i
hadn
t
meant
to
at
all
i
looked
for
another
outburst
from
her
but
to
my
amazement
she
flashed
me
a
smile
with
a
most
enigmatic
look
back
of
it
she
tossed
her
head
but
resumed
her
wiping
of
the
glass
with
a
certain
demureness
she
spoke
almost
meekly
they
re
very
old
friends
and
i
m
sure
they
always
act
right
i
don
t
see
anything
wrong
in
it
even
if
buck
edwards
has
shown
me
a
good
deal
of
but
this
very
meekness
of
hers
seemed
to
arouse
all
the
violence
in
my
nature
i
won
t
have
it
i
said
you
have
no
right
to
receive
presents
from
men
i
tell
you
i
won
t
have
it
you
ve
no
right
haven
t
i
she
suddenly
said
in
the
most
curious
cool
little
voice
her
eyes
falling
before
mine
haven
t
i
i
didn
t
it
was
quite
chilling
her
tone
and
manner
i
was
cool
in
an
instant
things
seemed
to
mean
so
much
more
than
i
had
supposed
they
did
i
mean
to
say
it
was
a
fair
crumpler
she
paused
in
her
wiping
of
the
glass
but
did
not
regard
me
i
was
horribly
moved
to
go
to
her
but
coolly
remembered
that
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
i
trust
i
have
said
enough
i
remarked
with
entirely
recovered
dignity
you
have
she
said
i
mean
i
won
t
have
such
things
i
said
i
hear
you
she
said
and
fell
again
to
her
work
i
thereupon
investigated
an
and
found
enough
matter
for
complaint
against
the
hobbs
boy
to
enable
me
to
manage
a
dignified
withdrawal
to
the
rear
the
remarkable
creature
was
humming
again
as
i
left
i
stood
in
the
back
door
of
the
grill
giving
upon
the
alley
where
i
mused
rather
excitedly
here
i
was
presently
interrupted
by
the
dog
barker
for
weeks
now
i
had
been
relieved
of
his
odious
attentions
by
the
very
curious
circumstance
that
he
had
transferred
them
to
the
honourable
george
not
all
my
kicks
and
cuffs
and
beatings
had
sufficed
one
whit
to
repulse
him
he
had
kept
after
me
fawned
upon
me
in
spite
of
them
and
then
on
a
day
he
had
suddenly
with
glad
cries
become
enamoured
of
the
honourable
george
waiting
for
him
at
doors
following
him
hanging
upon
his
every
look
and
the
honourable
george
had
rather
fancied
the
beast
and
made
much
of
him
and
yet
this
animal
is
reputed
by
poets
and
that
sort
of
thing
to
be
man
s
best
friend
faithfully
sharing
his
good
fortune
and
his
bad
staying
by
his
side
to
the
bitter
end
even
refusing
to
leave
his
body
when
he
has
perished
starving
there
with
a
dauntless
fidelity
how
chagrined
the
weavers
of
these
tributes
would
have
been
to
observe
the
fickle
nature
of
the
beast
in
question
for
weeks
he
had
hardly
deigned
me
a
glance
it
had
been
a
relief
to
be
sure
but
what
a
sickening
disclosure
of
the
cur
s
trifling
inconstancy
even
now
though
he
sniffed
hungrily
at
the
open
door
he
paid
me
not
the
least
attention
me
whom
he
had
once
idolized
i
slipped
back
to
the
and
procured
some
slices
of
beef
that
were
far
too
good
for
him
he
fell
to
them
with
only
a
perfunctory
acknowledgment
of
my
agency
in
procuring
them
why
i
thought
you
hated
him
suddenly
said
the
voice
of
his
owner
she
had
tiptoed
to
my
side
i
do
i
said
quite
savagely
but
the
unspeakable
beast
can
t
be
left
to
starve
can
he
i
felt
her
eyes
upon
me
but
would
not
turn
suddenly
she
put
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
patting
it
rather
curiously
as
she
might
have
soothed
her
child
when
i
did
turn
she
was
back
at
her
task
she
was
humming
again
nor
did
she
glance
my
way
quite
certainly
she
was
no
longer
conscious
that
i
stood
about
she
had
quite
forgotten
me
i
could
tell
as
much
from
her
manner
such
i
reflected
with
an
unaccustomed
cynicism
is
the
light
inconsequence
of
women
and
yet
i
still
experienced
a
curiously
thrilling
determination
to
protect
her
from
her
own
good
nature
in
the
matter
of
her
associates
at
a
later
and
cooler
moment
of
the
day
i
reflected
upon
her
defence
of
the
klondike
woman
a
prince
in
his
palace
not
too
good
for
her
no
doubt
she
had
meant
me
to
take
these
remarkable
words
quite
seriously
it
was
amazing
i
thought
with
what
seriousness
the
lower
classes
of
the
country
took
their
dogma
of
equality
and
with
what
na√Øve
confidence
they
relied
upon
us
to
accept
it
equality
in
north
america
was
indeed
praiseworthy
i
had
already
given
it
the
full
weight
of
my
approval
and
meant
to
live
by
it
but
at
home
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
the
crude
moral
worth
of
the
klondike
woman
might
be
all
that
her
two
defenders
had
alleged
and
indeed
i
felt
again
that
strange
little
thrill
of
almost
sympathy
for
her
as
one
who
had
been
unjustly
aspersed
but
i
could
only
resolve
that
i
would
be
no
party
to
any
unfair
plan
of
opposing
her
the
honourable
george
must
be
saved
from
her
trifling
as
well
as
from
her
serious
designs
if
such
she
might
have
but
so
far
as
i
could
influence
the
process
it
should
cause
as
little
chagrin
as
possible
to
the
offender
this
much
the
mixer
and
my
charwoman
had
achieved
with
me
indeed
quite
hopeful
i
was
that
when
the
creature
had
been
set
right
as
to
what
was
due
one
of
our
oldest
and
proudest
families
she
would
find
life
entirely
pleasant
among
those
of
her
own
station
she
seemed
to
have
a
good
heart
as
the
day
of
his
lordship
s
arrival
drew
near
became
increasingly
concerned
about
the
precise
manner
of
his
reception
and
the
details
of
his
entertainment
despite
my
best
assurances
that
no
especially
profound
thought
need
be
given
to
either
his
lordship
being
quite
that
sort
fussy
enough
in
his
own
way
but
hardly
formal
or
pretentious
his
prospective
host
after
many
consultations
with
me
at
length
allowed
himself
to
be
dissuaded
from
meeting
his
lordship
in
correct
afternoon
garb
of
and
consenting
at
my
urgent
suggestion
to
a
mere
of
tweeds
with
a
hat
and
a
suitable
rough
day
stick
again
in
the
matter
of
the
menu
for
his
lordship
s
initial
dinner
which
we
had
determined
might
well
be
tendered
him
at
my
establishment
both
husband
and
wife
were
rather
keen
for
an
elaborate
repast
of
many
courses
feeling
that
anything
less
would
be
doing
insufficient
honour
to
their
illustrious
guest
but
i
at
length
convinced
them
that
i
quite
knew
what
his
lordship
would
prefer
a
vegetable
soup
an
abundance
of
boiled
mutton
with
potatoes
a
thick
pudding
a
bit
of
scientifically
correct
cheese
and
a
jug
of
beer
rather
trying
they
were
at
my
first
mention
of
this
a
dinner
quite
without
finesse
to
be
sure
but
eminently
nutritive
and
only
their
certainty
that
i
knew
his
lordship
s
ways
made
them
give
in
the
affair
was
to
be
confined
to
the
family
his
lordship
the
only
guest
this
being
thought
discreet
for
the
night
of
his
arrival
in
view
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
his
mission
had
hoped
against
hope
that
the
mixer
might
not
be
present
and
even
so
late
as
the
day
of
his
lordship
s
arrival
he
was
cheered
by
word
that
she
might
be
compelled
to
keep
her
bed
with
a
neuralgia
to
the
afternoon
train
i
accompanied
him
in
his
new
finding
him
not
a
little
distressed
because
the
chauffeur
a
native
of
the
town
had
stoutly
and
with
some
not
nice
words
i
gathered
refused
to
wear
the
smart
uniform
which
his
employer
had
provided
i
would
have
shopped
the
fellow
in
an
instant
he
confided
to
me
had
it
been
at
any
other
time
he
was
most
impertinent
but
as
usual
here
i
am
at
the
mercy
of
circumstances
we
couldn
t
well
subject
brinstead
to
those
loathsome
public
we
waited
in
the
usual
throng
of
the
leisured
who
are
so
na√Øvely
pleased
at
the
passage
of
a
train
i
found
myself
picturing
their
childish
wonder
had
they
guessed
the
identity
of
him
we
were
there
to
meet
even
as
the
train
appeared
made
a
last
moan
of
complaint
mrs
pettengill
he
observed
dejectedly
is
about
the
house
again
and
i
fear
will
be
quite
well
enough
to
be
with
us
this
for
a
moment
i
almost
quite
disapproved
of
the
fellow
i
mean
to
say
he
was
vogue
and
all
that
and
no
doubt
had
been
wretchedly
mistreated
but
after
all
the
mixer
was
not
one
to
be
wished
ill
to
a
moment
later
i
was
contrasting
the
quiet
arrival
of
his
lordship
with
the
clamour
and
confusion
that
had
marked
the
advent
among
us
of
the
honourable
george
he
carried
but
one
bag
and
attracted
no
attention
whatever
from
the
station
loungers
while
i
have
never
known
him
be
entirely
vogue
in
his
appointments
his
lordship
carries
off
a
and
his
hat
with
a
certain
manner
which
the
honourable
george
was
never
known
to
achieve
even
in
the
days
when
i
groomed
him
the
grayish
rather
aggressive
looking
first
caught
my
eye
and
a
moment
later
i
had
taken
his
hand
at
the
same
time
took
his
bag
and
with
a
trepidation
so
obvious
that
his
lordship
may
perhaps
have
been
excusable
for
a
momentary
misapprehension
i
mean
to
say
he
instantly
and
crisply
directed
to
go
forward
to
the
luggage
van
and
recover
his
box
a
bit
awkward
it
was
to
be
sure
but
i
speedily
took
the
situation
in
hand
by
formally
presenting
the
two
men
covering
the
palpable
embarrassment
of
the
host
by
explaining
to
his
lordship
the
astounding
ingenuity
of
the
american
luggage
system
by
the
time
i
had
deprived
him
of
his
check
and
convinced
him
that
his
box
would
be
admirably
recovered
by
a
person
delegated
to
that
service
again
in
form
was
apologizing
to
him
for
the
squalid
character
of
the
station
and
for
the
hardships
he
must
be
prepared
to
endure
in
a
crude
western
village
here
again
the
host
was
annoyed
by
having
to
call
repeatedly
to
his
mechanician
in
order
to
detach
him
from
a
gossiping
group
of
loungers
he
came
smoking
a
quite
fearfully
bad
cigar
and
took
his
place
at
the
wheel
entirely
without
any
suitable
deference
to
his
employer
his
lordship
during
the
ride
rather
pointedly
surveyed
me
being
impressed
i
dare
say
by
something
in
my
appearance
and
manner
quite
new
to
him
doubtless
i
had
been
feeling
equal
for
so
long
that
the
thing
was
to
be
noticed
in
my
manner
he
made
no
comment
upon
me
however
indeed
almost
the
only
time
he
spoke
during
our
passage
was
to
voice
his
astonishment
at
not
having
been
able
to
procure
the
london
at
the
along
the
way
his
host
made
clucking
noises
of
sympathy
at
this
he
had
he
said
already
warned
his
lordship
that
america
was
still
crude
crude
of
course
what
what
exclaimed
his
lordship
but
naturally
they
d
have
the
i
dare
say
the
beggars
were
too
lazy
to
look
it
out
laziness
what
what
we
ve
a
job
teaching
them
to
know
their
places
ventured
moodily
regarding
the
back
of
his
chauffeur
which
somehow
contrived
to
be
eloquent
with
disrespect
for
him
my
word
what
rot
rejoined
his
lordship
i
saw
that
he
had
arrived
in
one
of
his
peppery
moods
i
fancy
he
could
not
have
recited
a
multiplication
table
without
becoming
fanatically
assertive
about
it
that
was
his
way
i
doubt
if
he
had
ever
condescended
to
have
an
opinion
what
might
have
been
opinions
came
out
on
him
like
a
rash
in
form
of
the
most
violent
convictions
what
rot
not
to
know
their
places
when
they
must
know
them
he
snappishly
added
quite
so
quite
so
his
host
hastened
to
assure
him
a
dashed
fine
big
country
you
have
was
his
only
other
observation
indeed
indeed
murmured
his
host
mildly
i
had
rather
dreaded
the
oath
which
his
lordship
is
prone
to
use
lightly
reaching
the
house
his
lordship
was
shown
to
the
apartment
prepared
for
him
tea
will
be
served
in
half
an
hour
your
er
brinstead
announced
his
host
cordially
although
seemingly
at
a
loss
how
to
address
him
quite
so
what
what
tea
of
course
of
course
why
wouldn
t
it
be
meantime
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
have
a
word
with
ruggles
at
softly
and
politely
withdrew
at
once
alone
with
his
lordship
i
thought
it
best
to
acquaint
him
instantly
with
the
change
in
my
circumstances
touching
lightly
upon
the
matter
of
my
now
being
an
equal
with
rather
most
of
the
north
americans
he
listened
with
exemplary
patience
to
my
brief
recital
and
was
good
enough
to
felicitate
me
assure
you
glad
to
hear
it
glad
no
end
worthy
fellow
always
knew
it
and
equal
of
course
of
course
take
up
their
equality
by
all
means
if
you
take
em
up
themselves
curious
lot
of
beggars
and
putting

but
don
t

it
myself
if
i
could
england

i
gasped

t
argue

firebrands

nothing
safe
pouring
their
beastly

no

no
dash

em
proper
i
he
was
working
himself
into
no
end
of
a
state
i
sought
to
divert
him
about
the
honourable
george
sir
i
ventured
what
s
the
silly
ass
up
to
now
dancing
girl
got
him
yes
how
he
does
it
i
can
t
think
no
looks
no
manner
no
way
with
women
can
t
stand
him
myself
how
ever
can
they
frightful
bore
old
george
is
well
well
man
i
m
waiting
tell
me
tell
me
tell
me
briefly
i
disclosed
to
him
that
his
brother
had
entangled
himself
with
a
young
person
who
had
indeed
been
a
dancing
girl
or
a
bit
like
that
in
the
province
of
alaska
that
at
the
time
of
my
cable
there
was
strong
reason
to
believe
she
would
stop
at
nothing
even
marriage
but
that
i
had
since
come
to
suspect
that
she
might
be
bent
only
on
making
a
fool
of
her
victim
she
being
although
an
honest
enough
character
rather
inclined
to
levity
and
without
proper
respect
for
established
families
i
hinted
briefly
at
the
social
warfare
of
which
she
had
been
a
storm
centre
i
said
again
remembering
the
warm
words
of
the
mixer
and
of
my
charwoman
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
her
character
was
without
blemish
all
at
once
i
was
feeling
preposterously
sorry
for
the
creature
his
lordship
listened
though
with
a
of
interruptions
alaska
dancing
girl
silly
nothing
but
snow
and
mines
in
or
again
make
a
fool
of
old
george
what
silly
piffle
already
done
it
himself
what
what
waste
her
time
and
if
she
wasn
t
keen
to
marry
him
had
i
called
him
across
the
ocean
to
intervene
in
a
vulgar
village
squabble
about
social
precedence
social
precedence
silly
rot
i
insisted
that
his
brother
should
be
seen
to
one
couldn
t
tell
what
the
woman
might
do
her
audacity
was
tremendous
even
for
an
american
to
this
he
listened
more
patiently
dare
say
you
re
right
you
don
t
go
off
your
head
easily
i
ll
rag
him
proper
now
i
m
here
always
knew
the
ass
would
make
a
silly
marriage
if
he
could
yes
yes
i
ll
break
it
up
quick
enough
i
say
i
ll
break
it
up
proper
dancers
and
that
sort
dangerous
but
i
know
their
a
summons
to
tea
below
interrupted
him
hungry
my
word
hardly
dared
eat
in
that
tinned
stuff
all
about
one
appendicitis
american
journal
some
colonel
chap
found
it
out
hunting
sort
looked
a
fool
beside
his
silly
horse
but
seemed
to
know
took
no
chances
said
the
slays
its
thousands
rot
no
doubt
perhaps
i
led
him
below
hardly
daring
at
the
moment
to
confess
my
own
responsibility
for
his
fears
another
time
i
thought
we
might
chat
of
it
with
his
wife
and
the
mixer
awaited
us
his
lordship
was
presented
and
i
excused
myself
mrs
pettengill
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
had
been
the
host
s
speech
of
presentation
to
the
mixer
how
do
do
earl
i
m
right
glad
to
meet
you
had
been
the
mixer
s
acknowledgment
together
with
a
hearty
grasp
of
the
hand
i
saw
his
lordship
s
face
brighten
what
ho
he
cried
with
the
first
cheerfulness
he
had
exhibited
and
the
mixer
still
vigorously
pumping
his
hand
had
replied
same
here
with
a
vast
smile
of
good
nature
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
at
least
were
quite
going
to
get
each
other
as
americans
say
come
right
in
and
set
down
in
the
parlour
she
was
saying
at
the
last
i
don
t
eat
between
meals
like
you
english
folks
are
always
doing
but
i
ll
take
a
shot
of
hooch
with
the
stood
back
not
a
little
distressed
they
seemed
to
publish
that
their
guest
was
being
torn
from
them
a
shot
of
hooch
observed
his
lordship
i
dare
say
your
shooting
over
here
is
absolutely
keener
sport
than
our
popping
at
driven
birds
what
what
chapter
eighteen
at
a
latish
seven
when
the
grill
had
become
nicely
filled
with
a
representative
crowd
the
arrived
with
his
lordship
the
latter
had
not
dressed
and
i
was
able
to
detect
that
doubtless
noting
his
guest
s
attire
at
the
last
moment
had
hastily
changed
back
to
a
of
his
own
also
i
noted
the
absence
of
the
mixer
and
wondered
how
the
host
had
contrived
to
eliminate
her
on
this
point
he
found
an
opportunity
to
enlighten
me
before
taking
his
seat
mark
my
words
that
old
devil
is
up
to
something
he
darkly
said
and
i
saw
that
he
was
genuinely
put
about
for
not
often
does
he
fall
into
strong
language
after
pushing
herself
forward
with
his
lordship
all
through
in
the
most
brazen
manner
she
announces
that
she
has
a
previous
dinner
engagement
and
can
t
be
with
us
i
m
as
well
pleased
to
have
her
absent
of
course
but
i
d
pay
handsomely
to
know
what
her
little
game
is
imagine
her
not
dining
with
the
earl
of
brinstead
when
she
had
the
chance
that
shows
something
s
wrong
i
don
t
like
it
i
tell
you
she
s
capable
of
i
mused
upon
this
the
mixer
was
undoubtedly
capable
of
things
especially
things
concerning
her
and
yet
i
could
imagine
no
opening
for
her
at
the
present
moment
and
said
as
much
and
i
was
glad
to
observe
did
not
share
her
husband
s
evident
worry
she
had
entered
the
place
plumingly
as
it
were
sweeping
the
length
of
the
room
before
his
lordship
with
quite
all
the
manner
her
somewhat
stubby
figure
could
carry
off
seated
she
became
at
once
vivacious
chatting
to
his
lordship
brightly
and
continuously
raking
the
room
the
while
with
her
lorgnon
half
a
dozen
ladies
of
the
north
side
set
were
with
parties
at
other
tables
i
saw
she
was
immensely
stimulated
by
the
circumstance
that
these
friends
were
unaware
of
her
guest
s
identity
i
divined
that
before
the
evening
was
over
she
would
contrive
to
disclose
it
his
lordship
responded
but
dully
to
her
animated
chat
he
is
never
less
urbane
than
when
hungry
and
i
took
pains
to
have
his
favourite
soup
served
quite
almost
at
once
this
he
fell
upon
i
may
say
that
he
has
always
a
hearty
manner
of
attacking
his
soup
not
infrequently
he
makes
noises
he
did
so
on
this
occasion
i
mean
to
say
there
was
no
finesse
i
hovered
near
anxious
that
the
service
should
be
without
flaw
his
head
bent
slightly
over
his
plate
i
saw
a
spoonful
of
soup
ascending
with
precision
toward
his
lips
but
curiously
it
halted
in
then
fell
back
his
lordship
s
eyes
had
become
fixed
upon
some
one
back
of
me
at
once
too
i
noted
looks
of
consternation
upon
the
faces
of
the
the
hostess
freezing
in
the
very
midst
of
some
choice
phrase
she
had
smilingly
begun
i
turned
quickly
it
was
the
klondike
person
radiant
in
the
costume
of
black
and
the
black
hat
she
moved
down
the
hushed
room
with
chin
eyes
straight
ahead
and
narrowed
to
but
a
faint
offended
consciousness
of
the
staring
crowd
it
was
well
done
it
was
superior
i
am
able
to
judge
those
things
reaching
a
table
the
second
but
one
from
the
s
she
relaxed
finely
from
the
austere
note
of
her
progress
and
turned
to
her
companions
with
a
pretty
and
quite
perfect
confusion
as
to
which
chair
she
might
occupy
quite
awfully
these
companions
were
the
mixer
overwhelming
in
black
velvet
and
diamonds
and
cousin
egbert
uncomfortable
enough
looking
but
as
correctly
enveloped
in
evening
dress
as
he
could
ever
manage
by
himself
his
cravat
had
been
tied
many
times
and
needed
it
once
more
they
were
seated
by
the
raccoon
with
quite
all
his
impressiveness
of
manner
they
faced
the
party
yet
seemed
unconscious
of
its
presence
cousin
egbert
with
a
bored
manner
which
i
am
certain
he
achieved
only
with
tremendous
effort
scanned
my
simple
menu
the
mixer
settled
herself
with
a
vast
air
of
comfort
and
arranged
various
about
her
on
the
table
between
them
the
klondike
woman
sat
with
a
restraint
that
would
actually
not
have
one
of
our
own
women
she
did
not
look
about
her
hands
were
still
her
head
was
up
at
former
times
with
her
own
set
she
had
been
wont
to
exhibit
a
rather
defiant
vivacity
now
she
did
not
challenge
finely
eloquently
there
pervaded
her
a
reserve
that
seemed
almost
to
exhale
a
fragrance
but
of
course
that
is
silly
rot
i
mean
to
say
she
drew
the
attention
without
visible
effort
she
only
waited
the
earl
of
brinstead
as
we
all
saw
had
continued
to
stare
thrice
slowly
arose
the
spoon
of
soup
for
mere
animal
habit
was
strong
upon
him
yet
at
a
certain
elevation
it
each
time
fell
slowly
back
he
was
acting
like
a
mechanical
toy
then
the
mixer
caught
his
eye
and
nodded
crisply
he
bobbed
in
response
what
ho
the
dowager
he
exclaimed
and
that
time
the
soup
was
successfully
resumed
poor
old
mater
sighed
his
hostess
she
s
constantly
taking
up
people
one
does
you
know
in
these
queer
western
jolly
old
thing
awfully
good
sort
said
his
lordship
but
his
eyes
were
not
on
the
mixer
terribly
then
i
recalled
the
honourable
george
s
behaviour
at
that
same
table
the
night
he
had
first
viewed
this
klondike
person
his
lordship
was
staring
in
much
the
same
fashion
yet
i
was
relieved
to
observe
that
the
woman
this
time
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
interest
she
had
aroused
in
the
case
of
the
honourable
george
who
had
frankly
ogled
her
for
the
poor
chap
has
ever
lacked
the
finer
shades
in
these
matters
she
had
not
only
been
aware
of
it
but
had
deliberately
played
upon
it
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
she
had
shown
herself
to
be
a
creature
of
blandishments
more
than
once
she
had
permitted
her
eyes
to
rest
upon
him
with
that
peculiarly
womanish
gaze
which
although
superficially
of
a
blank
innocence
is
yet
and
even
shoots
little
fine
arrows
of
questions
from
its
ambuscade
but
now
she
was
ignoring
his
lordship
as
utterly
as
she
did
the
to
be
sure
she
may
later
have
been
in
some
way
informed
that
his
eyes
were
seeking
her
but
never
once
i
am
sure
did
she
descend
to
even
a
veiled
challenge
of
his
glance
or
betray
the
faintest
discreet
consciousness
of
it
and
this
i
was
indeed
glad
to
note
in
her
clearly
she
must
know
where
to
draw
the
line
permitting
herself
a
malicious
laxity
with
a
younger
brother
which
she
would
not
have
the
presumption
to
essay
with
the
holder
of
the
title
pleased
i
was
i
say
to
detect
in
her
this
proper
respect
for
his
lordship
s
position
it
showed
her
to
be
not
all
unworthy
the
dinner
proceeded
his
lordship
being
good
enough
to
compliment
me
on
the
fare
which
i
knew
was
done
to
his
liking
yet
even
in
the
very
presence
of
the
boiled
mutton
his
eyes
were
too
often
upon
his
neighbour
when
he
behaved
thus
in
the
presence
of
a
dish
of
mutton
i
had
not
to
be
told
that
he
was
strongly
moved
i
uneasily
recalled
now
that
he
had
once
been
a
bit
of
a
dog
himself
i
mean
to
say
there
was
talk
in
the
countryside
though
of
course
it
had
died
out
a
score
of
years
ago
i
thought
it
as
well
however
that
he
be
told
almost
immediately
that
the
person
he
honoured
with
his
glance
was
no
other
than
the
one
he
had
come
to
subtract
his
unfortunate
brother
from
the
dinner
progressed
somewhat
jerkily
because
of
his
lordship
s
inattention
through
the
pudding
and
cheese
to
coffee
never
had
i
known
his
lordship
behave
so
languidly
in
the
presence
of
food
he
cared
for
his
hosts
ate
even
less
they
were
worried
however
could
simply
no
longer
contain
within
herself
the
secret
of
their
guest
s
identity
with
excuses
to
the
deaf
ears
of
his
lordship
she
left
to
address
a
friend
at
a
distant
table
she
addressed
others
at
other
tables
leaving
a
flutter
of
sensation
in
her
wake
having
lighted
one
of
his
cigarettes
endeavoured
to
engross
his
lordship
with
an
account
of
their
last
election
of
officers
to
the
country
club
his
lordship
was
not
properly
attentive
to
this
indeed
with
his
hostess
gone
he
no
longer
made
any
pretence
of
concealing
his
interest
in
the
other
table
i
saw
him
catch
the
eye
of
the
mixer
and
astonishingly
intercepted
from
her
a
swift
but
most
egregious
wink
one
moment
said
his
lordship
to
the
host
must
pay
my
respects
to
the
dowager
what
what
jolly
old
muggins
yes
and
he
was
gone
i
heard
the
mixer
s
amazing
presentation
speech
mrs
kenner
floud
his
lordship
say
listen
here
is
your
right
name
brinstead
or
basingwell
like
your
brother
s
the
klondike
person
acknowledged
the
thing
with
a
faintly
gracious
nod
it
carried
an
air
despite
the
slightness
of
it
cousin
egbert
was
more
cordial
pleased
to
meet
you
lord
said
he
and
grasped
the
newcomer
s
hand
come
on
set
in
with
us
and
have
some
coffee
and
a
cigar
here
jeff
bring
the
lord
a
good
cigar
we
was
just
talking
about
you
that
minute
how
do
you
like
our
town
say
this
here
kulanche
valley
i
lost
the
rest
his
lordship
had
seated
himself
at
his
own
table
writhed
acutely
he
was
lighting
a
second
cigarette
the
first
not
yet
a
quarter
consumed
at
once
the
four
began
to
be
thick
as
thieves
though
it
was
apparent
his
lordship
had
eyes
only
for
the
woman
coffee
was
brought
his
lordship
lighted
his
cigar
and
now
the
word
had
so
run
from
that
all
eyes
were
drawn
to
this
table
she
had
created
her
sensation
and
it
had
become
all
at
once
more
of
one
than
she
had
thought
from
judge
ballard
s
table
i
caught
her
glare
at
her
unconscious
mother
it
was
not
the
way
one
s
daughter
should
regard
one
in
public
presently
contriving
to
pass
the
table
again
i
noted
that
cousin
egbert
had
changed
his
form
of
address
have
some
brandy
with
your
coffee
earl
here
jeff
bring
earl
and
all
of
us
some
i
divined
the
monstrous
truth
that
he
supposed
himself
to
be
calling
his
lordship
by
his
first
name
and
he
in
turn
must
have
understood
my
shocked
glance
of
rebuke
for
a
bit
later
with
glad
relief
in
his
tones
he
was
addressing
his
lordship
as
cap
and
myself
he
had
given
the
rank
of
colonel
the
klondike
person
in
the
beginning
finely
maintained
her
reserve
only
at
the
last
did
she
descend
to
vivacity
or
the
use
of
her
eyes
this
later
laxness
made
me
wonder
if
after
all
she
would
feel
bound
to
pay
his
lordship
the
respect
he
was
wont
to
command
from
her
class
you
and
poor
george
are
rather
alike
i
overheard
except
that
he
uses
the
single
what
and
you
use
the
double
hasn
t
he
any
right
to
use
the
double
what
yet
and
what
does
it
mean
anyway
tell
what
what
demanded
his
lordship
a
bit
puzzled
but
that
s
it
what
do
you
say
what
what
for
it
can
t
do
you
any
what
what
but
i
mean
to
say
you
re
having
me
on
my
word
you
are
spoofing
i
mean
to
say
what
what
to
be
sure
chaffing
lot
you
are
he
laughed
he
was
behaving
almost
with
levity
but
poor
old
george
is
so
much
younger
than
you
you
must
make
allowances
i
again
caught
her
saying
and
his
lordship
replied
not
at
all
not
at
all
matter
of
a
years
barely
a
nine
and
a
few
months
younger
what
rot
chaffing
really
it
was
a
bit
thick
the
creature
saying
poor
old
george
quite
as
if
he
were
something
in
an
institution
having
to
be
wheeled
about
in
a
with
rugs
and
glad
i
was
when
the
trio
gave
signs
of
departure
it
was
woman
s
craft
dictating
it
i
dare
say
she
had
made
her
effect
and
knew
when
to
go
of
course
we
shall
have
to
talk
over
my
dreadful
designs
on
your
poor
old
george
said
the
amazing
woman
intently
regarding
his
lordship
at
parting
leave
it
to
me
said
he
with
a
scarcely
veiled
significance
well
see
you
again
cap
said
cousin
egbert
warmly
i
ll
take
you
around
to
meet
some
of
the
boys
we
ll
see
you
have
a
good
what
ho
his
lordship
replied
cordially
the
klondike
person
flashed
him
one
enigmatic
look
then
turned
to
precede
her
companions
again
down
the
thronged
room
she
swept
with
that
faintly
offended
half
consciousness
of
some
staring
rabble
at
hand
that
concerned
her
not
at
all
her
alert
feminine
foes
i
am
certain
read
no
slightest
trace
of
amusement
in
her
unwavering
lowered
glance
so
easily
she
could
have
been
crude
here
enduring
his
ignominious
solitude
to
the
limit
of
his
powers
had
joined
his
wife
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
they
had
taken
the
unfortunate
development
with
what
grace
they
could
his
lordship
had
dropped
in
upon
them
quite
informally
charming
man
that
he
was
of
course
he
would
quickly
break
up
the
disgraceful
affair
beginning
at
once
they
would
doubtless
entertain
for
him
in
a
quiet
way
at
the
deserted
table
his
lordship
now
relieved
a
certain
sickening
apprehension
that
had
beset
me
what
what
quite
right
to
call
me
out
here
shan
t
forget
it
dangerous
creature
that
badly
needed
i
was
can
t
think
why
you
waited
so
long
anything
might
have
happened
to
old
george
break
it
up
proper
though
never
do
at
all
impossible
person
for
him
quite
i
saw
they
had
indeed
taken
no
pains
to
hide
the
woman
s
identity
from
him
nor
their
knowledge
of
his
reason
for
coming
out
to
the
states
though
with
wretchedly
low
taste
they
had
done
this
chaffingly
yet
it
was
only
too
plain
that
his
lordship
now
realized
what
had
been
the
profound
gravity
of
the
situation
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
he
meant
to
end
it
without
any
nonsense
silly
ass
old
george
though
he
added
as
the
approached
how
a
creature
like
that
could
ever
have
fancied
him
what
what
his
hosts
were
profuse
in
their
apologies
for
having
so
thoughtlessly
run
away
from
his
lordship
they
carried
it
off
rather
well
they
were
keen
for
sitting
at
the
table
once
more
as
the
other
observant
diners
were
lingering
on
but
his
lordship
would
have
none
of
this
stuffy
place
said
he
best
be
getting
and
so
reluctantly
they
led
him
down
the
gauntlet
of
widened
eyes
even
so
the
tenth
earl
of
brinstead
had
dined
publicly
with
them
more
than
repaid
they
were
for
the
slight
the
honourable
george
had
put
upon
them
in
the
affair
of
the
pianoforte
artist
an
hour
later
had
me
on
by
telephone
his
voice
was
not
a
little
worried
i
say
is
his
lordship
the
earl
subject
to
spells
of
any
sort
we
were
in
the
library
where
i
was
showing
him
some
photographic
views
of
dear
old
boston
and
right
over
a
superb
print
of
our
public
library
he
seemed
to
lose
consciousness
might
it
be
a
stroke
or
do
you
think
it
s
just
a
healthy
sleep
and
shall
i
venture
to
shake
him
how
would
he
take
that
or
should
i
merely
cover
him
with
a
travelling
rug
it
would
be
so
dreadful
if
anything
happened
when
he
s
been
with
us
such
a
little
i
knew
his
lordship
he
has
the
gift
of
sleeping
quite
informally
when
his
attention
is
not
too
closely
engaged
i
suggested
that
the
host
set
his
musical
phonograph
in
motion
on
some
one
of
the
more
audible
selections
as
i
heard
no
more
from
him
that
night
i
dare
say
my
plan
worked
our
town
as
may
be
imagined
buzzed
with
transcendent
gossip
on
the
morrow
the
disclosed
at
last
that
the
of
boston
and
red
gap
were
quietly
entertaining
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
though
since
the
evening
before
this
had
been
news
to
hardly
any
one
nor
need
it
be
said
that
a
viciously
fermenting
element
in
the
gossip
concerned
the
apparently
cordial
meeting
of
his
lordship
with
the
klondike
person
an
encounter
that
had
been
watched
with
jealous
eyes
by
more
than
one
matron
of
the
north
side
set
it
was
even
intimated
that
if
his
lordship
had
come
to
put
the
creature
in
her
place
he
had
chosen
a
curious
way
to
set
about
it
also
there
were
hard
words
uttered
of
the
by
effie
and
severe
blame
put
upon
myself
because
his
lordship
had
not
come
out
to
the
flouds
but
the
brinsteads
have
always
stopped
with
us
before
she
went
about
saying
as
if
there
had
been
a
quite
long
succession
of
them
i
mean
to
say
only
the
honourable
george
had
stopped
on
with
them
unless
indeed
the
woman
actually
counted
me
as
one
between
herself
and
i
understood
there
ensued
early
that
morning
by
telephone
a
passage
of
virulent
acidity
effie
being
heard
by
cousin
egbert
to
say
bluntly
that
she
would
get
even
undoubtedly
she
did
not
share
the
annoyance
of
the
at
certain
eccentricities
now
developed
by
his
lordship
which
made
him
at
times
a
trying
house
guest
that
first
morning
he
arose
at
five
sharp
a
custom
of
his
which
i
deeply
regretted
not
having
warned
his
host
about
discovering
quite
no
one
about
he
had
ventured
abroad
in
search
of
breakfast
finding
it
at
length
in
the
eating
establishment
known
as
bert
s
place
in
company
with
milk
persons
and
others
of
a
common
sort
thereafter
he
had
tramped
furiously
about
the
town
and
its
environs
for
some
hours
at
last
encountering
cousin
egbert
who
escorted
him
to
the
floud
home
for
his
first
interview
with
the
honourable
george
the
latter
received
his
lordship
in
bed
so
cousin
egbert
later
informed
me
he
had
left
the
two
together
whereupon
for
an
hour
there
were
heard
quite
all
over
the
house
words
of
the
most
explosive
character
cousin
egbert
much
alarmed
at
the
passionate
beginning
of
the
interview
suspected
they
might
do
each
other
a
mischief
and
for
some
moments
hovered
about
with
the
aim
if
need
be
of
preserving
human
life
but
as
the
uproar
continued
evenly
he
at
length
concluded
they
would
do
no
more
than
talk
the
outcome
proving
the
accuracy
of
his
surmise
effie
meantime
saw
her
opportunity
and
seized
it
with
a
cool
readiness
which
i
have
often
remarked
in
her
distressed
beyond
measure
at
the
strange
absence
of
his
guest
had
communicated
with
me
by
telephone
several
times
without
result
not
until
near
noon
was
i
able
to
give
him
any
light
effie
had
then
called
me
to
know
what
his
lordship
preferred
for
luncheon
replying
that
cold
beef
pickles
and
beer
were
his
usual
fancy
i
hastened
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
only
to
find
that
effie
had
been
before
me
she
says
came
the
annoyed
voice
of
the
host
that
the
dear
earl
dropped
in
for
a
chat
with
his
brother
and
has
most
delightfully
begged
her
to
give
him
luncheon
she
says
he
will
doubtless
wish
to
drive
with
them
this
afternoon
but
i
had
already
planned
to
drive
him
myself
to
the
country
club
and
about
the
woman
is
i
must
say
for
god
s
sake
can
t
you
do
something
i
was
obliged
to
tell
him
straight
that
the
thing
was
beyond
me
though
i
promised
to
recover
his
guest
promptly
should
any
opportunity
occur
the
latter
did
not
however
drive
with
the
flouds
that
afternoon
he
was
observed
walking
abroad
with
cousin
egbert
and
it
was
later
reported
by
persons
of
unimpeachable
veracity
that
they
had
been
seen
to
enter
the
klondike
person
s
establishment
evening
drew
on
without
further
news
but
then
certain
elated
members
of
the
bohemian
set
made
it
loosely
known
that
they
were
that
evening
to
dine
informally
at
their
leader
s
house
to
meet
his
lordship
it
seemed
a
bit
extraordinary
to
me
yet
i
could
not
but
rejoice
that
he
should
thus
adopt
the
peaceful
methods
of
diplomacy
for
the
extrication
of
his
brother
now
telephoning
to
know
if
i
had
heard
this
report
canard
he
styled
it
i
confirmed
it
and
remarked
that
his
lordship
was
undoubtedly
by
way
of
bringing
strong
pressure
to
bear
on
the
woman
but
i
had
expected
him
to
meet
a
few
people
here
this
evening
cried
the
host
pathetically
i
was
then
obliged
to
tell
him
that
the
brinsteads
for
centuries
had
been
bluntly
averse
to
meeting
a
few
people
it
seemed
to
run
in
the
blood
the
bohemian
dinner
although
quite
informal
was
said
to
have
been
highly
enjoyed
by
all
including
the
honourable
george
who
was
among
those
present
as
well
as
cousin
egbert
the
latter
gossiped
briefly
of
the
affair
the
following
day
sure
the
cap
had
a
good
time
all
right
he
said
of
course
he
ain
t
the
mixer
the
judge
is
but
he
livens
up
quite
some
now
and
then
talks
like
a
bunch
of
firecrackers
going
off
all
to
once
don
t
he
funny
guy
i
walked
with
him
to
the
jacksons
about
twelve
or
one
he
s
going
back
to
mis
kenner
s
house
today
he
says
it
ll
take
a
lot
of
talking
back
and
forth
to
get
this
thing
settled
right
and
it
s
got
to
be
right
he
says
he
seen
that
right
he
paused
as
if
to
meditate
profoundly
if
you
was
to
ask
me
though
i
d
say
she
had
him
just
like
that
he
held
an
open
hand
toward
me
then
tightly
clenched
it
suspecting
he
might
spread
absurd
gossip
of
this
sort
i
explained
carefully
to
him
that
his
lordship
had
indeed
at
once
perceived
her
to
be
a
dangerous
woman
and
that
he
was
now
taking
his
own
cunning
way
to
break
off
the
distressing
affair
between
her
and
his
brother
he
listened
patiently
but
seemed
wedded
to
some
monstrous
view
of
his
own
them
dames
of
that
there
north
side
set
better
watch
out
he
remarked
ominously
first
thing
they
know
what
that
kate
kenner
ll
hand
them
they
can
make
a
lemonade
out
of
i
could
make
but
little
of
this
save
its
general
import
which
was
of
course
quite
shockingly
preposterous
i
found
myself
wishing
to
be
sure
that
his
lordship
had
been
able
to
accomplish
his
mission
to
north
america
without
appearing
to
meet
the
person
as
a
social
equal
as
i
feared
indeed
that
a
wrong
impression
of
his
attitude
would
be
gained
by
the
undiscerning
public
it
might
have
been
better
i
was
almost
quite
certain
had
he
adopted
a
stern
and
even
brutal
method
at
the
outset
instead
of
the
circuitous
and
diplomatic
shared
this
view
with
me
i
should
hate
dreadfully
to
have
his
lordship
s
reputation
suffer
for
this
he
confided
to
me
the
first
week
dragged
to
its
close
in
this
regrettable
fashion
oftener
than
not
his
hosts
caught
no
glimpse
of
his
lordship
throughout
the
day
the
smart
trap
and
the
tandem
team
were
constantly
ready
but
he
had
not
yet
been
driven
abroad
by
his
host
each
day
he
alleged
the
necessity
of
conferring
with
the
woman
dangerous
creature
my
word
but
dangerous
he
would
announce
takes
no
end
of
managing
do
it
though
do
it
proper
take
a
high
hand
with
her
can
t
have
silly
old
george
in
a
mess
own
brother
what
what
time
needed
though
not
with
you
at
dinner
if
you
don
t
mind
creature
has
a
way
of
picking
up
things
not
half
but
each
day
met
him
with
pressing
offers
of
such
entertainment
as
the
town
afforded
three
times
he
had
been
obliged
to
postpone
the
informal
evening
affair
for
a
few
smart
people
yet
though
patient
he
was
determined
reluctantly
at
last
he
abandoned
the
design
of
driving
his
guest
about
in
the
trap
but
he
insistently
put
forward
the
he
would
drive
it
himself
they
would
spend
pleasant
hours
going
about
the
country
his
lordship
continued
elusive
to
myself
he
confided
that
his
host
was
a
nagger
awfully
nagging
sort
yes
doesn
t
know
the
strain
i
m
under
getting
this
silly
affair
straight
country
interesting
no
doubt
what
what
but
my
word
saw
nothing
but
country
coming
out
country
quite
all
about
miles
and
miles
both
sides
of
the
metals
seen
enough
country
seen
too
my
word
enough
of
both
what
what
yet
it
seemed
that
on
the
saturday
after
his
arrival
he
could
no
longer
decently
put
off
his
insistent
host
he
consented
to
accompany
him
in
the
rotten
judging
it
was
on
the
part
of
he
should
have
listened
to
me
they
departed
after
luncheon
the
host
at
the
wheel
i
had
his
account
of
such
following
events
as
i
did
not
myself
observe
our
country
club
he
observed
early
in
the
drive
no
one
there
of
course
you
d
never
believe
the
trouble
i
ve
had
jolly
good
club
replied
his
lordship
drive
back
that
back
that
way
it
appeared
would
take
them
by
the
detached
villa
of
the
klondike
person
stop
here
directed
his
lordship
shan
t
detain
you
a
this
was
at
of
a
fair
afternoon
i
am
able
to
give
but
the
bare
facts
yet
i
must
assume
that
the
emotions
of
as
he
waited
there
during
the
ensuing
two
hours
were
of
a
quite
distressing
nature
as
much
was
intimated
by
several
observant
townspeople
who
passed
him
he
was
said
to
be
distrait
to
be
smoking
his
cigarettes
furiously
at
his
lordship
reappeared
with
apparent
solicitude
he
escorted
the
klondike
person
fetchingly
gowned
in
a
street
costume
of
the
latest
mode
they
chatted
gayly
to
the
car
hope
i
ve
not
kept
you
waiting
old
chap
said
his
lordship
genially
time
slips
by
one
so
you
two
met
of
course
course
he
bestowed
his
companion
in
the
tonneau
and
ensconced
himself
beside
her
drive
said
he
to
your
goods
shops
draper
s
chemist
s
where
was
it
to
the
central
market
responded
the
lady
in
tones
then
to
the
red
front
store
and
to
that
dear
little
japanese
shop
if
he
doesn
t
mind
mind
course
not
course
not
are
you
warm
let
me
fasten
the
i
confess
to
have
felt
a
horrid
fascination
for
this
moment
as
i
was
able
to
reconstruct
it
from
s
impassioned
words
it
was
by
way
of
being
one
of
those
scenes
we
properly
loathe
yet
morbidly
can
not
resist
overlooking
if
opportunity
offers
into
the
flood
tide
of
our
saturday
shopping
throng
swept
the
car
and
its
remarkably
assembled
occupants
the
street
fair
gasped
the
woman
s
former
parade
of
the
honourable
george
had
been
as
nothing
to
this
exposure
poor
jackson
s
face
was
a
study
declared
the
mixer
to
me
later
i
dare
say
it
was
still
a
study
when
my
own
turn
came
to
observe
it
the
car
halted
before
the
shops
that
had
been
designated
the
klondike
person
dispatched
her
commissions
in
a
superbly
leisured
manner
attentively
accompanied
by
the
earl
of
brinstead
bearing
packages
for
her
at
the
wheel
stared
straight
ahead
i
am
told
he
bore
himself
with
dignity
even
when
some
of
our
more
ingenuous
citizens
paused
to
converse
with
him
concerning
his
new
he
is
even
said
to
have
managed
a
smile
when
his
passengers
returned
i
have
it
exclaimed
his
lordship
now
deuced
good
plan
go
to
that
ruggles
place
for
a
jolly
fat
tea
no
end
of
a
spree
what
what
it
is
said
that
on
three
occasions
in
turning
his
car
and
traversing
the
short
block
to
the
grill
the
owner
escaped
disastrous
collision
with
other
vehicles
only
by
the
narrowest
possible
margin
he
may
have
courted
something
of
the
sort
i
dare
say
he
was
desperate
join
us
of
course
said
his
lordship
as
he
assisted
his
companion
to
alight
again
i
am
told
the
host
managed
to
illumine
his
refusal
with
a
smile
he
would
take
no
tea
the
doctor
s
orders
the
surprising
pair
entered
at
the
height
of
my
and
were
served
to
an
accompaniment
of
stares
from
the
ladies
present
to
this
they
appeared
oblivious
being
intent
upon
their
conference
his
lordship
was
amiable
to
a
degree
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
he
had
found
the
woman
even
more
dangerous
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
he
was
being
forced
to
play
a
deep
game
with
her
and
was
meeting
guile
with
guile
he
had
i
suspected
found
his
poor
brother
far
deeper
in
than
any
of
us
had
thought
doubtless
he
had
written
compromising
letters
that
must
be
secured
letters
she
would
hold
at
a
price
and
yet
i
had
never
before
had
excuse
to
believe
his
lordship
possessed
the
diplomatic
temperament
i
reflected
that
i
must
always
have
misread
him
he
was
deep
after
all
not
until
the
two
left
did
i
learn
that
awaited
them
with
his
car
he
loitered
about
in
adjacent
doorways
quite
like
a
hired
fellow
he
was
passionately
smoking
more
cigarettes
than
were
good
for
him
i
escorted
my
guests
to
the
car
took
his
seat
with
but
one
glance
at
me
yet
it
was
eloquent
of
all
the
ignominy
that
had
been
heaped
upon
him
home
i
think
said
the
lady
when
they
were
well
seated
she
said
it
charmingly
home
repeated
his
lordship
are
you
quite
protected
by
the
robe
an
incautious
pedestrian
at
the
next
crossing
narrowly
escaped
being
run
down
he
shook
a
fist
at
the
vanishing
car
and
uttered
a
stream
of
oaths
so
vile
that
he
would
instantly
have
been
taken
up
in
any
city
half
an
hour
later
called
me
he
got
out
with
that
fiend
he
s
staying
on
there
but
my
god
can
nothing
be
done
his
lordship
is
playing
a
most
desperate
game
i
hastened
to
assure
him
he
s
meeting
difficulties
she
must
have
her
dupe
s
letters
in
her
possession
blackmail
i
dare
say
best
leave
his
lordship
free
he
s
a
deep
he
presumed
far
this
afternoon
only
the
man
s
position
saved
him
with
me
his
voice
seemed
choked
with
anger
then
remotely
faint
as
distant
cannonading
a
rumble
reached
me
it
was
hoarse
laughter
of
the
mixer
perhaps
in
another
room
the
electric
telephone
has
been
perfected
in
the
states
to
a
marvellous
delicacy
of
response
i
now
found
myself
observing
effie
who
had
been
among
the
absorbed
onlookers
while
the
pair
were
at
their
tea
she
having
occupied
a
table
with
judge
ballard
and
martingale
deeply
immersed
in
thought
she
had
been
scarce
replying
to
her
companions
her
eyes
had
narrowed
in
a
way
i
well
knew
when
she
reviewed
the
social
field
still
absorbed
she
was
when
cousin
egbert
entered
accompanied
by
the
honourable
george
the
latter
had
seen
but
little
of
his
brother
since
their
first
stormy
interview
but
he
had
also
seen
little
of
the
klondike
woman
his
spirits
however
had
seemed
quite
undashed
he
rarely
missed
his
tea
now
as
they
seated
themselves
they
were
joined
quickly
by
effie
who
engaged
her
relative
in
earnest
converse
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
begged
a
favour
she
kept
a
hand
on
his
arm
she
urged
presently
seeming
to
have
achieved
her
purpose
she
left
them
and
i
paused
to
greet
the
pair
i
guess
that
there
effie
is
awful
silly
remarked
cousin
egbert
enigmatically
no
sir
she
can
t
ever
tell
how
the
cat
is
going
to
nor
would
he
say
more
though
he
most
elatedly
held
a
secret
with
this
circumstance
i
connected
the
announcement
in
monday
s
that
mrs
senator
floud
would
on
that
evening
entertain
at
dinner
the
members
of
red
gap
s
bohemian
set
including
kate
kenner
the
guest
of
honour
being
his
lordship
the
earl
of
brinstead
at
present
visiting
in
this
city
covers
it
added
would
be
laid
for
i
saw
that
cousin
egbert
would
have
been
made
the
ambassador
to
conduct
what
must
have
been
a
business
of
some
delicacy
among
the
members
of
the
north
side
set
the
report
occasioned
the
wildest
alarm
and
yet
so
staunch
were
known
to
be
the
principles
of
effie
that
but
few
accused
her
of
downright
treachery
it
seemed
to
be
felt
that
she
was
but
lending
herself
to
the
furtherance
of
some
deep
design
of
his
lordship
s
blackmail
the
recovery
of
compromising
letters
the
avoidance
of
legal
proceedings
these
were
hinted
at
for
myself
i
suspected
that
she
had
merely
misconstrued
the
seeming
cordiality
of
his
lordship
toward
the
woman
and
at
the
expense
of
the
had
sought
the
honour
of
entertaining
him
if
to
do
that
she
must
entertain
the
woman
well
and
good
she
was
not
one
to
funk
her
fences
with
the
game
in
sight
consulting
me
as
to
the
menu
for
her
dinner
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
the
vegetable
soup
boiled
mutton
thick
pudding
and
cheese
which
i
recommended
though
she
pleaded
at
length
for
a
chance
to
use
the
new
fish
set
and
for
a
complicated
salad
portrayed
in
her
latest
woman
s
magazine
covered
with
grated
nuts
it
was
in
the
illustration
i
was
able
however
to
convince
her
that
his
lordship
would
regard
grated
nuts
as
silly
from
i
learned
by
telephone
during
these
days
being
sensitive
he
stopped
in
almost
quite
continuously
that
effie
had
profusely
explained
to
his
wife
about
the
dinner
of
course
my
dear
i
couldn
t
have
the
presumption
to
ask
you
and
your
husband
to
sit
at
table
with
the
creature
even
if
he
did
think
it
all
right
to
drive
her
about
town
on
a
shopping
trip
but
i
thought
we
ought
to
do
something
to
make
the
dear
earl
s
visit
one
to
be
remembered
he
s
appreciative
i
m
sure
you
understand
just
how
things
are
in
reciting
this
speech
to
me
essayed
to
simulate
the
tone
and
excessive
manner
of
a
woman
gushing
falsely
the
fellow
was
quite
bitter
about
it
i
sometimes
think
i
ll
give
up
he
concluded
god
only
knows
what
things
are
coming
to
it
began
to
seem
even
to
me
that
they
were
coming
a
bit
thick
but
i
knew
that
his
lordship
was
a
determined
man
he
was
of
the
bulldog
breed
that
has
made
old
england
what
it
is
i
mean
to
say
i
knew
he
would
put
the
woman
in
her
place
chapter
nineteen
echoes
of
the
monday
night
dinner
reached
me
the
following
day
the
affair
had
passed
off
pleasantly
enough
the
members
of
the
bohemian
set
conducting
themselves
quite
as
persons
who
mattered
with
the
exception
of
the
klondike
woman
herself
who
i
gathered
had
descended
to
a
mood
of
most
indecorous
liveliness
considering
who
the
guest
of
honour
was
she
had
not
only
played
and
sung
those
noisy
native
folksongs
of
hers
but
she
had
it
seemed
conducted
herself
with
a
certain
facetious
familiarity
toward
his
lordship
every
now
and
then
said
cousin
egbert
my
principal
informant
she
d
whirl
in
and
josh
the
cap
all
over
the
place
about
them
funny
whiskers
he
wears
she
told
him
out
and
out
he
d
just
got
to
lose
shocking
rudeness
i
exclaimed
oh
sure
sure
he
agreed
yet
without
indignation
and
the
cap
just
hated
her
for
it
you
could
tell
that
by
the
way
he
looked
at
her
oh
he
hates
her
something
terrible
he
just
can
t
bear
the
sight
of
naturally
enough
i
observed
though
there
had
been
an
undercurrent
to
his
speech
that
i
thought
almost
quite
a
little
odd
his
accents
were
queerly
placed
had
i
not
known
him
too
well
i
should
have
thought
him
trying
to
be
deep
i
recalled
his
other
phrases
that
effie
was
seeing
which
way
a
cat
would
leap
and
that
the
klondike
person
would
hand
the
ladies
of
the
north
side
set
a
lemon
squash
i
put
them
all
down
as
childish
prattle
and
said
as
much
to
the
mixer
later
in
the
day
as
she
had
a
dish
of
tea
at
the
grill
yes
s
right
she
observed
that
earl
just
hates
the
sight
of
her
can
t
bear
to
look
at
her
a
but
she
too
intoned
the
thing
queerly
he
s
putting
pressure
to
bear
on
her
i
said
pressure
said
the
mixer
and
then
hum
very
dryly
with
this
news
however
it
was
plain
as
a
that
things
were
going
badly
with
his
lordship
s
effort
to
release
the
honourable
george
from
his
entanglement
the
woman
doubtless
with
his
compromising
letters
would
be
holding
out
for
a
stiffish
price
she
would
think
them
worth
no
end
and
plainly
again
his
lordship
had
thrown
off
his
mask
was
unable
longer
to
conceal
his
aversion
for
her
this
to
be
sure
was
more
in
accordance
with
his
character
as
i
had
long
observed
it
if
he
hated
her
it
was
like
him
to
show
it
when
he
looked
at
her
i
mean
he
was
quite
like
that
with
almost
any
one
i
hoped
however
that
diplomacy
might
still
save
us
all
sorts
of
a
nasty
row
to
my
relief
when
the
pair
appeared
for
tea
that
afternoon
a
sight
no
longer
causing
the
least
sensation
i
saw
that
his
lordship
must
have
returned
to
his
first
or
diplomatic
manner
doubtless
he
still
hated
her
but
one
would
little
have
suspected
it
from
his
manner
of
looking
at
her
i
mean
to
say
he
looked
at
her
another
way
the
opposite
way
in
fact
he
was
being
subtle
in
the
extreme
i
fancied
it
must
have
been
her
wretched
levity
regarding
his
beard
that
had
goaded
him
into
the
exhibitions
of
hatred
noted
by
cousin
egbert
and
the
mixer
unquestionably
his
lordship
may
be
goaded
in
no
time
if
one
deliberately
sets
about
it
at
the
time
doubtless
he
had
sliced
a
drive
or
two
as
one
might
say
but
now
he
was
back
in
form
again
i
confess
i
was
not
a
little
sorry
for
the
creature
seeing
her
there
so
smartly
taken
in
by
his
effusive
manner
he
was
having
her
on
in
the
most
obvious
way
and
she
poor
dupe
taking
it
all
quite
seriously
prime
it
was
though
considering
the
creature
s
designs
and
i
again
marvelled
that
in
all
the
years
of
my
association
with
his
lordship
i
had
never
suspected
what
a
topping
sort
he
could
be
at
this
game
his
mask
was
now
perfect
it
recalled
indeed
cousin
egbert
s
simple
but
telling
phrase
about
the
honourable
george
he
looks
at
her
it
could
now
have
been
said
of
his
lordship
with
the
utmost
significance
to
any
but
those
in
the
know
and
so
began
quite
as
had
the
first
the
second
week
of
his
lordship
s
stay
among
us
knowing
he
had
booked
a
return
from
cooks
i
fancied
that
results
of
some
sort
must
soon
ensue
the
pressure
he
was
putting
on
the
woman
must
begin
to
tell
and
this
was
the
extreme
of
the
encouragement
i
was
able
to
offer
the
both
he
and
his
wife
were
of
course
in
a
bit
of
a
state
nor
could
i
blame
them
with
an
earl
for
house
guest
they
must
be
content
with
but
a
glimpse
of
him
at
odd
moments
rather
a
barren
honour
they
were
finding
it
his
lordship
s
conferences
with
the
woman
were
unabated
when
not
secluded
with
her
at
her
own
establishment
he
would
be
abroad
with
her
in
her
trap
or
in
the
car
of
the
owner
however
no
longer
drove
his
car
he
had
never
taken
another
chance
and
well
i
knew
these
activities
of
his
lordship
s
were
being
basely
misconstrued
by
the
gossips
the
cap
is
certainly
some
queener
remarked
cousin
egbert
which
perhaps
reflected
the
view
of
the
deceived
public
at
this
time
the
curious
term
implying
that
his
lordship
was
by
way
of
being
a
bit
of
a
dog
but
calm
i
remained
under
these
aspersions
counting
upon
a
vindication
of
his
lordship
s
methods
when
he
should
have
got
the
woman
where
he
wished
her
i
remained
i
repeat
serenely
confident
that
a
signal
triumph
would
presently
crown
his
lordship
s
subtly
planned
attack
and
then
at
midweek
i
was
rudely
shocked
to
the
suspicion
that
all
might
not
be
going
well
with
his
plan
i
had
not
seen
the
pair
for
a
day
and
when
they
did
appear
for
their
tea
i
instantly
detected
a
profound
change
in
their
mutual
bearing
his
lordship
still
looked
at
the
woman
but
the
raillery
of
their
past
meetings
had
gone
too
plainly
something
momentous
had
occurred
even
the
woman
was
serious
had
they
fought
to
the
last
stand
would
she
have
been
too
much
for
him
i
mean
to
say
was
the
honourable
george
cooked
i
now
recalled
that
i
had
observed
an
almost
similar
change
in
the
latter
s
manner
his
face
wore
a
look
of
wildest
gloom
that
might
have
been
mitigated
perhaps
by
a
proper
trimming
of
his
beard
but
even
then
it
would
have
been
remarked
by
those
who
knew
him
well
i
divined
i
repeat
that
something
momentous
had
now
occurred
and
that
the
honourable
george
was
one
not
least
affected
by
it
rather
a
sleepless
night
i
passed
wondering
fearfully
if
after
all
his
lordship
would
have
been
unable
to
extricate
the
poor
chap
from
this
sordid
entanglement
had
the
creature
held
out
for
too
much
had
she
refused
to
compromise
would
there
be
one
of
those
appalling
legal
things
which
our
best
families
so
often
suffer
what
if
the
victim
were
to
cut
off
home
nor
was
my
trepidation
allayed
by
the
cryptic
remark
of
judson
as
i
passed
her
at
her
tasks
in
the
pantry
that
morning
a
prince
in
his
palace
not
too
good
that
s
what
i
said
she
shot
the
thing
at
me
with
a
manner
suspiciously
near
to
flippancy
i
sternly
demanded
her
meaning
i
mean
what
i
mean
she
retorted
shutting
her
lips
upon
it
in
a
definite
way
she
has
well
enough
i
knew
the
import
of
her
uncivil
speech
but
i
resolved
not
to
bandy
words
with
her
because
in
my
position
it
would
be
undignified
because
further
of
an
unfortunate
effect
she
has
upon
my
temper
at
such
times
she
s
being
terrible
careful
about
associates
she
presently
went
on
with
a
most
irritating
effect
of
addressing
only
herself
nothing
at
all
but
just
dukes
and
earls
and
lords
day
in
and
day
out
too
often
when
the
woman
seems
to
wish
it
she
contrives
to
get
me
in
motion
as
the
american
saying
is
and
it
is
deeply
to
be
regretted
i
replied
with
dignity
that
other
persons
must
say
less
of
themselves
if
put
to
well
she
knew
what
i
meant
despite
my
previous
clear
warning
she
had
more
than
once
accepted
small
gifts
from
the
hank
and
buck
and
had
even
been
seen
brazenly
in
public
with
them
at
a
cinema
palace
one
of
a
more
suspicious
nature
than
i
might
have
guessed
that
she
conducted
herself
thus
for
the
specific
purpose
of
enraging
me
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
no
nature
could
be
more
free
than
mine
from
vulgar
jealousy
and
i
spoke
now
from
the
mere
wish
that
she
should
more
carefully
guard
her
reputation
as
before
she
exhibited
a
surprising
meekness
under
this
rebuke
though
i
uneasily
wondered
if
there
might
not
be
guile
beneath
it
can
i
help
it
she
asked
if
they
like
to
show
me
attentions
i
guess
i
m
a
free
she
lifted
her
head
to
observe
a
glass
she
had
polished
her
eyes
were
curiously
lighted
she
had
this
way
of
embarrassing
me
and
invariably
moreover
she
aroused
all
that
is
evil
in
my
nature
against
the
two
especially
the
buck
one
actually
on
another
occasion
professing
admiration
for
his
wavy
chestnut
hair
i
saw
now
that
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
of
the
fellow
i
took
up
another
matter
that
baby
of
yours
is
too
horribly
fat
i
said
suddenly
i
had
long
meant
to
put
this
to
her
it
s
too
fat
it
eats
too
much
to
my
amazement
the
creature
was
transformed
into
a
vixen
it
it
too
fat
you
call
my
boy
it
and
say
he
s
too
fat
don
t
you
dare
what
does
a
creature
like
you
know
of
babies
why
you
wouldn
t
even
know
but
the
thing
was
too
painful
let
her
angry
words
be
forgotten
suffice
to
say
she
permitted
herself
to
cry
out
things
that
might
have
given
grave
offence
to
one
less
certain
of
himself
than
i
rather
chilled
i
admit
i
was
by
her
frenzied
outburst
i
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
instantly
that
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
criticism
of
her
offspring
must
be
led
up
to
rather
perhaps
couched
in
less
direct
phrases
than
i
had
chosen
fearful
i
was
that
she
would
burst
into
another
torrent
of
rage
but
to
my
amazement
she
all
at
once
smiled
what
a
fool
i
am
she
exclaimed
kidding
me
were
you
trying
to
make
me
mad
about
the
baby
well
i
ll
give
you
good
you
did
it
yes
sir
i
never
would
have
thought
you
had
a
kidding
streak
in
you
old
little
you
know
me
i
retorted
and
quickly
withdrew
for
i
was
then
more
embarrassed
than
ever
and
besides
there
were
other
and
graver
matters
forward
to
depress
and
occupy
me
in
my
fitful
sleep
of
the
night
before
i
had
dreamed
vividly
that
i
saw
the
honourable
george
being
dragged
shackled
to
the
altar
i
trust
i
am
not
superstitious
but
the
vision
had
remained
with
me
in
all
its
tormenting
detail
a
veiled
woman
had
grimly
awaited
him
as
he
struggled
with
his
uniformed
captors
i
mean
to
say
he
was
being
hustled
along
by
two
constables
that
day
let
me
now
put
down
was
to
be
a
day
of
the
most
fearful
shocks
that
a
man
of
rather
sensitive
nervous
organism
has
ever
been
called
upon
to
endure
there
are
now
lines
in
my
face
that
i
make
no
doubt
showed
then
for
the
first
time
and
it
was
a
day
that
dragged
interminably
so
that
i
became
fair
off
my
head
with
the
suspense
of
it
feeling
that
at
any
moment
the
worst
might
happen
for
hours
i
saw
no
one
with
whom
i
could
consult
once
i
was
almost
moved
to
call
up
so
intolerable
was
the
menacing
uncertainty
but
this
i
knew
bordered
on
hysteria
and
i
restrained
the
impulse
with
an
iron
will
but
i
wretchedly
longed
for
a
sight
of
cousin
egbert
or
the
mixer
or
even
of
the
honourable
george
some
one
to
assure
me
that
my
horrid
dream
of
the
night
before
had
been
a
baseless
fabric
as
the
saying
is
the
very
absence
of
these
people
and
of
his
lordship
was
in
itself
ominous
nervously
i
kept
to
a
post
at
one
of
my
windows
where
i
could
survey
the
street
and
here
at
i
sustained
my
first
shock
terrific
it
was
his
lordship
had
emerged
from
the
chemist
s
across
the
street
he
paused
a
moment
as
if
to
recall
his
next
mission
then
walked
briskly
off
and
this
is
what
i
had
been
stupefied
to
note
he
was
clean
shaven
the
brinstead
were
gone
whiskers
that
had
been
worn
in
precisely
that
fashion
by
a
tremendous
line
of
the
earls
of
brinstead
and
the
tenth
of
his
line
had
abandoned
them
as
well
i
thought
could
he
have
defaced
the
brinstead
arms
it
was
plain
as
a
indeed
the
woman
had
our
family
at
her
mercy
and
she
would
show
no
mercy
my
heart
sank
as
i
pictured
the
honourable
george
in
her
toils
my
dream
had
been
prophetic
then
i
reflected
that
this
very
circumstance
of
his
lordship
s
having
pandered
to
her
lawless
whim
about
his
beard
would
go
to
show
he
had
not
yet
given
up
the
fight
if
the
thing
were
hopeless
i
knew
he
would
have
seen
her
dashed
before
he
would
have
relinquished
it
there
plainly
was
still
hope
for
poor
george
indeed
his
lordship
might
well
have
planned
some
splendid
coup
this
defacement
would
be
a
part
of
his
strategy
suffered
in
anguish
for
his
ultimate
triumph
quite
cheered
i
became
at
the
thought
i
still
scanned
the
street
crowd
for
some
one
who
could
acquaint
me
with
developments
i
must
have
missed
but
then
a
moment
later
came
the
call
by
telephone
of
i
answered
it
though
with
little
hope
than
to
hear
more
of
his
unending
complaints
about
his
lordship
s
negligence
startled
instantly
i
was
however
for
his
voice
was
stranger
than
i
had
known
it
even
in
moments
of
his
acutest
distress
hoarse
it
was
and
his
words
alarming
but
hardly
intelligible
heard
my
god
heard
my
god
marriage
marriage
god
but
here
he
broke
off
into
the
most
appalling
laughter
the
laughter
of
a
chained
patient
in
a
hardly
could
i
endure
it
and
grateful
i
was
when
i
heard
the
line
close
even
when
he
attempted
vocables
he
had
sounded
quite
like
an
inferior
record
on
a
phonographic
machine
but
i
had
heard
enough
to
leave
me
aghast
beyond
doubt
now
the
very
worst
had
come
upon
our
family
his
lordship
s
tremendous
sacrifice
would
have
been
all
in
vain
marriage
the
honourable
george
was
done
for
better
had
it
been
the
i
bitterly
reflected
her
father
had
at
least
been
a
curate
thankful
enough
i
now
was
for
the
rush
i
could
distract
myself
from
the
appalling
disaster
that
day
i
took
rather
more
than
my
accustomed
charge
of
the
serving
i
chatted
with
our
business
chaps
recommending
the
joint
in
the
highest
terms
drawing
corks
seeing
that
the
relish
was
abundantly
stocked
at
every
table
i
was
striving
to
forget
judson
alone
persisted
in
reminding
me
of
the
impending
scandal
a
prince
in
his
palace
she
would
maliciously
murmur
as
i
encountered
her
i
think
she
must
have
observed
that
i
was
bitter
for
she
at
last
spoke
quite
amiably
of
our
morning
s
you
certainly
got
my
goat
she
said
in
the
quaint
american
fashion
telling
me
little
was
too
fat
you
had
me
going
there
for
a
minute
thinking
you
meant
it
the
creature
s
name
was
albert
yet
she
persisted
in
calling
it
because
the
child
itself
would
thus
falsely
declare
its
name
upon
being
questioned
having
in
some
strange
manner
gained
this
impression
it
was
another
matter
i
meant
to
bring
to
her
attention
but
at
this
crisis
i
had
no
heart
for
it
my
crowd
left
i
was
again
alone
to
muse
bitterly
upon
our
plight
still
i
scanned
the
street
hoping
for
a
sight
of
cousin
egbert
who
i
fancied
would
be
informed
as
to
the
wretched
details
instead
now
i
saw
the
honourable
george
he
walked
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
thoroughfare
his
manner
of
dejection
precisely
what
i
should
have
expected
followed
closely
as
usual
he
was
by
the
judson
cur
a
spirit
of
desperate
mockery
seized
me
i
called
to
judson
who
was
gathering
glasses
from
a
table
i
indicated
the
pair
mr
barker
i
said
is
dogging
his
i
mean
to
say
i
uttered
the
words
in
the
most
solemn
manner
little
the
woman
knew
that
one
may
often
be
moved
in
the
most
distressing
moments
to
a
jest
of
this
sort
she
laughed
heartily
being
of
quick
discernment
and
thus
jauntily
did
i
carry
my
knowledge
of
the
lowering
cloud
but
i
permitted
myself
no
further
sallies
of
that
sort
i
stayed
expectantly
by
the
window
and
i
dare
say
my
bearing
would
have
deceived
the
most
alert
i
was
steadily
calm
the
situation
called
precisely
for
that
the
hours
sped
darkly
and
my
fears
mounted
in
sheer
desperation
at
length
i
had
myself
put
through
to
to
my
astonishment
he
seemed
quite
revived
though
in
a
state
of
feverish
gayety
he
fair
bubbled
just
leaving
this
moment
with
his
lordship
to
gather
up
some
friends
we
meet
at
your
place
yes
yes
all
the
uncertainty
is
past
better
set
up
that
largest
table
rather
a
almost
more
confusing
it
was
than
his
former
message
which
had
been
confined
to
calls
upon
his
maker
and
to
maniac
laughter
was
he
i
wondered
merely
making
the
best
of
it
had
he
resolved
to
be
a
dead
sportsman
a
few
moments
later
he
discharged
his
lordship
at
my
door
and
drove
rapidly
on
only
a
question
of
time
it
is
when
he
will
be
had
heavily
for
damages
due
to
his
reckless
driving
his
lordship
bustled
in
with
a
cheerfulness
that
staggered
me
he
too
was
gay
almost
debonair
a
gardenia
was
in
his
lapel
he
was
vogue
to
the
last
detail
in
a
gray
that
had
all
the
style
essentials
almost
it
seemed
as
if
three
valets
had
been
needed
to
groom
him
he
briskly
rubbed
his
hands
biggest
table
people
tea
that
sort
of

to
my
acute
distress
he
here
thumbed
me
in
the
ribs
and
laughed
again
was
he
too
i
wondered
madly
resolved
to
be
a
dead
sportsman
in
the
face
of
the
unavoidable
i
sought
to
edge
in
a
discreet
word
of
condolence
for
i
knew
that
between
us
there
need
be
no
pretence
i
know
you
did
your
best
sir
i
observed
and
i
was
never
quite
free
of
a
fear
that
the
woman
would
prove
too
many
for
us
i
trust
the
honourable
george
but
i
had
said
as
much
as
he
would
let
me
he
interrupted
me
with
his
thumb
again
and
on
his
face
was
what
in
a
lesser
person
i
should
unhesitatingly
have
called
a
leer
you
dog
you
woman
prove
too
many
for
us
what
what
dare
say
you
knew
what
to
expect
silly
old
george
though
how
she
could
ever
have
fancied
the
juggins
i
was
about
to
remark
that
the
creature
had
of
course
played
her
game
from
entirely
sordid
motives
and
i
should
doubtless
have
ventured
to
applaud
the
game
spirit
in
which
he
was
taking
the
blow
but
before
i
could
shape
my
phrases
on
this
delicate
ground
effie
the
senator
and
cousin
egbert
arrived
they
somewhat
formally
had
the
air
of
being
expected
all
of
them
rushed
upon
his
lordship
with
an
excessive
manner
apparently
they
were
all
to
be
dead
sportsmen
together
and
then
effie
called
me
aside
you
can
do
me
a
favour
she
began
about
the
wedding
breakfast
and
reception
dear
kate
s
place
is
so
small
it
wouldn
t
do
there
will
be
a
crush
of
course
i
ve
had
the
loveliest
idea
for
it
our
own
house
you
know
how
delighted
we
d
be
the
earl
has
been
so
charming
and
everything
has
turned
out
so
splendidly
oh
i
d
love
to
do
them
this
little
parting
kindness
use
your
influence
like
a
good
fellow
won
t
you
when
the
thing
is
suggested
only
too
gladly
i
responded
sick
at
heart
and
she
returned
to
the
group
well
i
knew
her
motive
she
was
by
way
of
getting
even
with
the
as
cousin
egbert
in
his
american
fashion
would
put
it
she
was
trying
to
pass
them
a
bison
but
i
was
willing
enough
she
should
house
the
dreadful
affair
the
more
private
the
better
thought
i
a
moment
later
s
car
appeared
at
my
door
now
discharging
the
klondike
woman
effusively
escorted
by
the
mixer
and
by
the
latter
at
least
i
had
thought
would
show
more
principle
but
she
had
buckled
atrociously
quite
as
had
her
husband
who
had
quickly
almost
merrily
followed
them
there
was
increased
gayety
as
they
seated
themselves
about
the
large
table
a
silly
noise
of
pretended
felicitation
over
a
calamity
that
not
even
the
tenth
earl
of
brinstead
had
been
able
to
avert
and
then
beckoned
me
aside
i
want
your
help
old
chap
in
case
it
s
needed
he
began
the
wedding
breakfast
and
reception
i
said
quite
cynically
you
ve
thought
of
it
good
her
own
place
is
far
too
small
crowd
of
course
and
it
s
rather
proper
at
our
place
too
his
lordship
having
been
our
house
guest
you
see
use
what
influence
you
have
the
affair
will
be
rather
widely
commented
on
even
the
new
york
papers
i
dare
count
upon
me
i
answered
blandly
even
as
i
had
promised
effie
disgusted
i
was
let
them
maul
each
other
about
over
the
wretched
they
could
all
be
dead
sports
if
they
chose
but
i
was
now
firmly
resolved
that
for
myself
i
should
make
not
a
bit
of
pretence
the
creature
might
trick
poor
george
into
a
marriage
but
i
for
one
would
not
affect
to
regard
it
as
other
than
a
blight
upon
our
house
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
hoping
that
the
victim
himself
might
have
cut
off
to
unknown
parts
when
i
saw
him
enter
by
the
other
members
of
the
party
he
was
hailed
with
cries
of
delight
though
his
own
air
was
finely
honest
being
dejected
in
the
extreme
he
was
dressed
as
regrettably
as
usual
this
time
in
parts
of
two
as
he
joined
those
at
the
table
i
constrained
myself
to
serve
the
champagne
senator
floud
arose
with
a
brimming
glass
my
friends
he
began
in
his
manner
let
us
remember
that
red
gap
s
loss
is
england
s
gain
to
the
future
countess
of
brinstead
to
my
astonishment
this
appalling
breach
of
good
taste
was
received
with
the
loudest
applause
nor
was
his
lordship
the
least
clamorous
of
them
i
mean
to
say
the
chap
had
as
good
as
wished
that
his
lordship
would
directly
pop
off
it
was
beyond
me
i
walked
to
the
farthest
window
and
stood
a
long
time
gazing
pensively
out
i
wished
to
be
away
from
that
false
show
but
they
noticed
my
absence
at
length
and
called
to
me
monstrously
i
was
desired
to
drink
to
the
happiness
of
the
groom
i
thought
they
were
pressing
me
too
far
but
as
they
quite
gabbled
now
with
their
tea
and
things
i
hoped
to
pass
it
off
the
senator
however
seemed
to
fasten
me
with
his
eye
as
he
proposed
the
toast
to
the
happy
man
i
drank
perforce
a
body
would
think
bill
was
drinking
to
the
judge
remarked
cousin
egbert
in
a
high
voice
eh
i
said
startled
to
this
outburst
by
his
strange
words
good
old
george
exclaimed
his
lordship
owe
it
all
to
the
old
juggins
what
what
the
klondike
person
spoke
i
heard
her
voice
as
a
bell
pealing
through
breakers
at
sea
i
mean
to
say
i
was
now
fair
dazed
not
to
old
george
said
she
to
old
ruggles
to
old
ruggles
promptly
cried
the
senator
and
they
drank
muddled
indeed
i
was
again
in
my
eventful
career
i
felt
myself
tremble
i
knew
not
what
i
should
say
any
being
quite
gone
i
had
received
a
crumpler
of
some
sort
but
what
my
sleeve
was
touched
i
turned
blindly
as
in
a
nightmare
the
hobbs
cub
who
was
my
vestiare
was
handing
me
our
evening
paper
i
took
it
from
him
staring
staring
until
my
knees
grew
weak
across
the
page
in
clarion
type
rang
the
unbelievable
words
british
peer
wins
american
bride
his
lordship
tenth
earl
of
brinstead
to
wed
one
of
red
gap
s
fairest
daughters
my
hands
so
shook
that
in
quick
subterfuge
i
dropped
the
sheet
then
stooped
for
it
trusting
to
control
myself
before
i
again
raised
my
face
mercifully
the
others
were
diverted
by
the
journal
it
was
seized
from
me
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
incredible
words
read
aloud
by
each
in
turn
they
jested
of
it
amazing
chaps
your
pressmen
thus
the
tenth
earl
of
brinstead
while
i
pinched
myself
viciously
to
bring
back
my
lost
aplomb
speedy
beggars
what
what
never
knew
it
myself
till
last
night
she
would
and
she
wouldn
i
think
you
knew
said
the
lady
stricken
as
i
was
i
noted
that
she
eyed
him
rather
strangely
quite
as
if
she
felt
some
decent
respect
for
him
marriage
is
serious
boomed
the
mixer
don
t
blame
her
don
t
blame
her
swear
i
don
t
returned
his
lordship
few
days
to
think
it
over
quite
right
quite
right
got
to
know
their
own
minds
my
word
while
their
attention
was
thus
mercifully
diverted
from
me
my
own
world
by
painful
degrees
resumed
its
stability
i
mean
to
say
i
am
not
the
fainting
sort
but
if
i
were
then
i
should
have
keeled
over
at
my
first
sight
of
that
journal
but
now
i
merely
recovered
my
glass
of
champagne
and
drained
it
rather
pigged
it
a
bit
i
fancy
badly
needing
a
stimulant
i
was
to
be
sure
they
now
discussed
details
the
ceremony
that
sort
of
thing
before
a
registrar
quickest
way
said
his
lordship
nonsense
church
of
course
rumbled
the
mixer
very
arbitrarily
quite
so
then
assented
his
lordship
get
me
the
rector
of
the
parish
a
vicar
a
curate
something
of
that
then
the
breakfast
and
reception
suggested
effie
with
a
meaning
glance
at
me
before
she
turned
to
the
lady
of
course
dearest
your
own
tiny
nest
would
never
hold
your
host
of
friends
i
ve
never
noticed
said
the
other
quickly
it
s
always
seemed
big
enough
she
added
in
pensive
tones
and
with
downcast
eyes
oh
not
large
enough
by
half
put
in
most
charming
little
but
worlds
too
small
for
all
your
with
a
glance
at
me
he
narrowed
his
eyes
in
friendly
calculation
i
m
somewhat
puzzled
myself
suppose
we
see
what
the
capable
ruggles
has
to
let
ruggles
suggest
something
by
all
means
cried
effie
i
mean
to
say
they
both
quite
thought
they
knew
what
i
would
suggest
but
it
was
nothing
of
the
sort
the
situation
had
entirely
changed
quite
another
sort
of
thing
it
was
quickly
i
resolved
to
fling
them
both
aside
i
too
would
be
a
dead
sportsman
i
was
about
to
suggest
i
remarked
that
my
place
here
is
the
only
one
at
all
suitable
for
the
breakfast
and
reception
i
can
promise
that
the
affair
will
go
off
the
two
had
looked
up
with
such
radiant
expectation
at
my
opening
words
and
were
so
plainly
in
a
state
at
my
conclusion
that
i
dare
say
the
future
countess
of
brinstead
at
once
knew
what
she
flashed
them
a
look
then
eyed
me
with
quick
understanding
great
she
exclaimed
in
a
hearty
american
manner
then
that
s
settled
she
continued
briskly
as
both
and
effie
would
have
interposed
ruggles
shall
do
everything
take
it
off
our
shoulders
ices
flowers
the
invitation
list
will
need
great
care
of
course
remarked
with
a
quite
savage
glance
at
me
but
you
just
called
him
the
capable
ruggles
insisted
the
fianc√©e
we
shall
leave
it
all
to
him
how
many
will
you
ask
ruggles
her
eyes
flicked
from
mine
to
quite
almost
every
one
i
answered
firmly
fine
she
said
ripping
said
his
lordship
his
lordship
will
of
course
wish
a
best
man
suggested
i
should
be
only
too
glad
you
re
going
to
suggest
ruggles
again
cried
the
lady
just
the
man
for
it
you
re
quite
right
why
we
owe
it
all
to
ruggles
don
t
we
she
here
beamed
upon
his
lordship
wore
an
expression
of
the
keenest
disrelish
of
course
course
replied
his
lordship
dashed
good
man
ruggles
owe
it
all
to
him
what
what
i
fancy
in
the
cordial
excitement
of
the
moment
he
was
quite
sincere
as
to
her
ladyship
i
am
to
this
day
unable
to
still
a
faint
suspicion
that
she
was
having
me
on
true
she
owed
it
all
to
me
but
i
hadn
t
a
bit
meant
it
and
well
she
knew
it
subtle
she
was
i
dare
say
but
bore
me
no
malice
though
she
was
not
above
setting
back
a
pace
or
two
each
time
he
moved
up
a
final
toast
was
drunk
and
my
guests
drifted
out
again
glared
savagely
at
me
as
he
went
but
effie
rather
outglared
him
even
i
should
hardly
have
cared
to
face
her
at
that
moment
and
i
was
still
in
a
high
state
of
muddle
it
was
all
beyond
me
had
his
lordship
i
wondered
too
seriously
taken
my
careless
words
about
american
equality
of
course
i
had
meant
them
to
apply
only
to
those
stopping
on
in
the
states
cousin
egbert
lingered
to
the
last
rather
with
a
troubled
air
of
wishing
to
consult
me
when
i
at
length
came
up
with
him
he
held
the
journal
before
me
indicating
lines
in
the
article
relict
of
an
alaskan
capitalist
now
for
some
years
one
of
red
gap
s
social
read
that
there
he
commanded
grimly
then
with
a
terrific
earnestness
i
had
never
before
remarked
in
him
say
listen
here
i
better
go
round
right
off
and
mix
it
up
with
that
fresh
guy
what
s
he
hinting
around
at
by
that
there
word
relict
why
say
she
was
married
to
him
i
hastily
corrected
his
preposterous
interpretation
of
the
word
much
to
his
relief
i
was
still
in
my
precious
state
of
muddle
judson
took
occasion
to
flounce
by
me
in
her
work
of
clearing
the
table
a
prince
in
his
palace
she
taunted
i
laughed
in
a
lofty
manner
why
you
poor
thing
i
ve
known
it
all
for
some
days
i
said
well
i
must
say
you
re
the
deep
one
if
you
did
never
letting
on
she
was
unable
to
repress
a
glance
of
admiration
at
me
as
she
moved
off
i
stood
where
she
had
left
me
meditating
profoundly
chapter
twenty
two
days
later
at
high
noon
was
solemnized
the
marriage
of
his
lordship
to
the
woman
who
without
a
bit
meaning
it
i
had
so
curiously
caused
to
enter
his
life
the
day
was
for
myself
so
crowded
with
emotions
that
it
returns
in
rather
a
jumble
patches
of
incidents
little
floating
clouds
of
memory
some
meaningless
and
one
at
least
to
be
significant
to
my
last
day
the
ceremony
was
had
in
our
most
nearly
smart
church
it
was
only
a
methodist
church
but
i
took
pains
to
assure
myself
that
a
ceremony
performed
by
its
curate
would
be
legal
i
still
seem
to
hear
the
organ
strains
of
the
voice
that
breathed
through
eden
as
we
neared
the
altar
also
the
mixer
s
rumbling
whisper
about
a
lost
handkerchief
which
she
apparently
found
herself
needing
at
that
moment
the
responses
of
bride
and
groom
were
unhesitating
even
firm
her
ladyship
i
thought
had
never
appeared
to
better
advantage
than
in
the
lustreless
gown
she
had
chosen
as
always
she
had
finely
known
what
to
put
on
her
head
senator
floud
despite
s
suggestion
of
himself
for
the
office
had
been
selected
to
give
away
the
bride
as
the
saying
is
he
performed
his
function
with
dignity
though
i
recall
being
seized
with
horror
when
the
moment
came
almost
certain
i
am
he
restrained
himself
with
difficulty
from
making
a
sort
of
a
speech
the
church
was
thronged
i
had
seen
to
that
i
had
told
her
ladyship
that
i
should
ask
quite
almost
every
one
and
this
i
had
done
squarely
in
the
face
of
s
pleading
that
discretion
be
used
for
a
great
white
light
as
one
might
say
had
now
suffused
me
i
had
seen
that
the
moment
was
come
when
the
warring
factions
of
red
gap
should
be
reunited
a
bismarck
i
felt
myself
indeed
that
i
acted
ably
was
later
to
be
seen
even
for
the
wedding
breakfast
which
occurred
directly
after
the
ceremony
i
had
shown
myself
a
dictator
in
the
matter
of
guests
covers
were
laid
in
my
room
for
seventy
and
among
these
were
included
not
only
the
members
of
the
north
side
set
and
the
entire
bohemian
set
but
many
worthy
persons
not
hitherto
socially
existent
yet
who
had
been
friends
or
of
the
bride
i
am
persuaded
to
confess
that
in
a
few
of
these
instances
i
was
not
above
a
snarky
little
wish
to
correct
the
social
horizon
of
to
make
it
more
broadly
accord
as
i
may
say
with
the
spirit
of
american
equality
for
which
their
forefathers
bled
and
died
on
the
battlefields
of
boston
new
york
and
vicksburg
not
the
least
of
my
reward
then
was
to
see
his
eyebrows
more
than
once
eloquently
raise
as
when
the
hank
and
buck
appeared
in
suits
of
decent
black
or
when
the
driver
chap
pierce
entered
with
his
quite
obscure
mother
on
his
arm
or
a
few
other
cattle
and
horse
persons
with
whom
the
honourable
george
had
palled
up
during
his
process
of
going
in
for
america
this
laxity
i
felt
that
the
earl
of
brinstead
and
his
bride
could
amply
afford
while
for
myself
i
had
soundly
determined
that
red
gap
should
henceforth
be
without
i
mean
to
say
having
frankly
taken
up
america
i
was
at
last
resolved
to
do
it
if
i
could
not
take
up
the
whole
of
it
i
would
not
take
up
a
part
quite
instinctively
i
had
chosen
the
slogan
of
our
chamber
of
commerce
don
t
knock
boost
and
boost
rudely
worded
though
it
is
i
had
seen
it
to
be
sound
in
spirit
these
thoughts
ran
in
my
mind
during
the
smart
repast
that
now
followed
insidiously
i
wrought
among
the
guests
to
amalgamate
into
one
friendly
whole
certain
elements
that
had
hitherto
been
hostile
the
bohemian
set
was
not
segregated
almost
my
first
inspiration
had
been
to
scatter
its
members
widely
among
the
conservative
pillars
of
the
north
side
set
left
in
one
group
i
had
known
they
would
plume
themselves
quite
intolerably
over
the
signal
triumph
of
their
leader
perhaps
in
the
american
speech
start
widely
scattered
they
became
mere
parts
of
the
whole
i
was
seeking
to
achieve
the
banquet
progressed
gayly
to
its
finish
toasts
were
drunk
no
end
all
of
them
proposed
by
senator
floud
who
toward
the
last
kept
almost
constantly
on
his
feet
from
the
bride
and
groom
he
expanded
geographically
through
red
gap
the
kulanche
valley
the
state
of
washington
and
the
united
states
to
the
british
empire
not
omitting
the
honourable
george
who
i
noticed
called
for
the
relish
and
consumed
quite
almost
an
entire
bottle
during
the
meal
also
i
was
proposed
through
whose
lifelong
friendship
for
the
illustrious
groom
this
meeting
of
hearts
and
hands
has
been
so
happily
brought
her
ladyship
s
eyes
rested
briefly
upon
mine
as
her
lips
touched
the
glass
to
this
they
conveyed
the
unspeakable
rather
a
fool
i
felt
and
unable
to
look
away
until
she
released
me
she
had
been
wondrously
quiet
through
it
all
not
dazed
in
the
least
as
might
have
been
looked
for
in
one
of
her
lowly
station
thus
prodigiously
elevated
and
not
feverishly
gay
as
might
also
have
been
anticipated
simple
and
quiet
she
was
showing
a
complete
but
perfectly
controlled
awareness
of
her
position
for
the
first
time
then
i
think
i
did
envision
her
as
the
countess
of
brinstead
she
was
going
to
carry
it
off
perhaps
quite
as
well
as
even
i
could
have
wished
his
lordship
s
chosen
mate
to
do
i
observed
her
look
at
his
lordship
with
those
strange
lights
in
her
eyes
as
if
only
half
realizing
yet
wholly
believing
all
that
he
believed
and
once
at
the
height
of
the
gayety
i
saw
her
reach
out
to
touch
his
sleeve
furtively
swiftly
and
so
gently
he
never
knew
it
occurred
to
me
there
were
things
about
the
woman
we
had
taken
too
little
trouble
to
know
i
wondered
what
old
memories
might
be
coming
to
her
now
what
staring
faces
might
obtrude
what
old
perhaps
hated
voices
might
be
sounding
to
her
what
of
remembered
hurts
and
heartaches
might
newly
echo
back
to
make
her
flinch
and
wonder
if
she
dreamed
she
touched
the
sleeve
again
as
it
might
have
been
in
protection
from
them
her
eyes
narrowed
her
gaze
fixed
it
queerly
occurred
to
me
that
his
lordship
might
find
her
as
difficult
to
know
as
we
had
and
yet
would
keep
always
trying
more
than
we
had
to
be
sure
i
mean
to
say
she
was
no
gabbler
the
responses
to
the
senator
s
toasts
increased
in
volume
his
final
flight
i
recall
involved
terms
like
our
of
the
british
isles
and
introduced
a
figure
of
speech
about
hands
across
the
sea
which
i
thought
striking
indeed
the
applause
aroused
by
this
was
noisy
in
the
extreme
a
number
of
the
cattle
and
horse
persons
including
the
redskin
tuttle
emitting
a
shrill
concerted
yipping
which
though
it
would
never
have
done
with
us
seemed
somehow
not
out
of
place
in
north
america
although
i
observed
to
make
gestures
of
extreme
repugnance
while
it
lasted
there
ensued
a
rather
flurried
wishing
of
happiness
to
the
pair
a
novel
sight
it
was
the
most
austere
matrons
of
the
north
side
set
vying
for
places
in
the
line
that
led
past
them
i
found
myself
trying
to
analyze
the
inner
emotions
of
some
of
them
i
best
knew
as
they
fondly
greeted
the
now
radiant
countess
of
brinstead
but
that
way
madness
lay
as
shakespeare
has
so
aptly
said
of
another
matter
i
recalled
though
the
comment
of
cousin
egbert
who
stood
near
me
don
t
them
dames
stand
the
gaff
noble
it
was
quite
true
they
were
heroic
i
recalled
then
his
other
quaint
prophecy
that
her
ladyship
would
hand
them
a
bottle
of
lemonade
as
is
curiously
usual
with
this
simple
soul
he
had
gone
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
the
throng
dwindled
to
the
more
intimate
friends
among
those
who
lingered
were
the
and
effie
quite
solicitous
they
were
for
the
dear
countess
as
they
rather
defiantly
called
her
to
one
another
casually
mentioned
in
my
hearing
that
he
had
been
asked
to
for
the
shooting
effie
who
also
heard
swiftly
remarked
that
she
would
doubtless
run
over
in
the
spring
the
dear
earl
was
so
insistent
they
rather
glared
at
each
other
but
in
truth
his
lordship
had
insisted
that
quite
almost
every
one
should
come
and
stop
on
with
him
of
course
course
what
what
jolly
party
no
end
of
fun
that
sort
of
thing
know
she
ll
like
her
old
friends
best
wouldn
t
be
keen
for
the
creature
if
she
d
not
have
em
all
have
em
all
capital
by
jove
to
be
sure
it
was
a
manner
of
speaking
born
of
the
expansive
good
feeling
of
the
moment
yet
i
believe
cousin
egbert
was
the
only
invited
one
to
decline
he
did
so
with
evident
distress
at
having
to
refuse
i
like
your
little
woman
a
whole
lot
he
observed
to
his
lordship
but
europe
is
too
kind
of
uncomfortable
for
me
keeps
me
upset
all
the
time
what
with
all
the
foreigners
and
one
thing
and
another
but
listen
here
cap
you
pack
the
little
woman
back
once
in
a
while
just
to
give
us
a
flash
at
her
we
ll
give
you
both
a
good
what
ho
returned
his
lordship
of
course
course
fancy
we
d
like
it
vastly
what
what
yes
sir
i
fancy
you
would
too
and
rather
startlingly
cousin
egbert
seized
her
ladyship
and
kissed
her
heartily
whereupon
her
ladyship
kissed
the
fellow
in
return
yes
sir
i
dare
say
i
fancy
you
would
he
called
back
a
bit
nervously
as
he
left
drove
the
party
to
the
station
feeling
i
am
sure
that
he
scored
over
effie
though
he
was
obliged
to
include
the
mixer
from
whom
her
ladyship
bluntly
refused
to
be
separated
i
inferred
that
she
must
have
found
the
time
and
seclusion
in
which
to
weep
a
bit
on
the
mixer
s
shoulder
the
waist
of
the
latter
s
purple
satin
gown
was
quite
spotty
at
the
height
of
her
ladyship
s
eyes
on
this
occasion
drove
his
car
with
the
greatest
solicitude
proceeding
more
slowly
than
i
had
ever
known
him
do
as
i
attended
to
certain
luggage
details
at
the
station
he
was
regretting
to
his
lordship
that
they
had
not
had
a
longer
time
at
the
country
club
the
day
it
was
exhibited
look
a
bit
after
silly
old
george
said
his
lordship
to
me
at
parting
chap
s
dotty
i
dare
say
talking
about
a
plantation
of
apple
trees
now
for
his
old
age
that
sort
of
thing
be
something
new
in
a
fortnight
though
like
him
of
course
course
her
ladyship
closed
upon
my
hand
with
a
remarkable
vigour
of
grip
we
owe
it
all
to
you
she
said
again
with
dancing
eyes
then
her
eyes
steadied
queerly
maybe
you
won
t
be
know
i
shan
i
fancy
i
rather
growled
it
stupidly
feeling
i
was
not
rising
to
the
occasion
knew
his
lordship
wouldn
t
rest
till
he
had
you
where
he
wanted
you
glad
he
s
got
and
curiously
i
felt
a
bit
of
a
glad
little
squeeze
in
my
throat
for
her
i
groped
for
something
light
something
american
you
are
some
countess
i
at
last
added
in
a
silly
way
what
what
said
his
lordship
but
i
had
caught
her
eyes
they
brimmed
with
understanding
with
the
going
of
that
train
all
life
seemed
to
go
i
mean
to
say
things
all
at
once
became
flat
i
turned
to
the
dull
station
give
you
a
lift
old
chap
said
again
he
was
cordial
so
firmly
had
i
kept
the
reins
of
the
whole
affair
in
my
grasp
such
prestige
he
knew
it
would
give
me
he
dared
not
broach
his
grievance
some
american
phrase
of
cousin
egbert
s
ran
in
my
mind
i
had
put
a
buffalo
on
him
thank
you
i
said
i
m
needing
a
bit
of
a
stretch
and
a
i
wished
to
walk
that
i
might
the
better
meditate
with
one
does
not
sufficiently
meditate
a
block
up
from
the
station
i
was
struck
by
the
sight
of
the
honourable
george
plodding
solitary
down
that
low
street
he
was
heeled
as
usual
by
the
judson
cur
he
came
to
the
spilmer
public
house
and
for
a
moment
stared
up
quite
still
at
the
last
chance
on
its
chaffing
signboard
then
he
wheeled
abruptly
and
entered
i
was
moved
to
follow
him
but
i
knew
it
would
never
do
he
would
row
me
about
the
service
of
the
grill
something
of
that
sort
i
dare
say
he
had
fancied
her
ladyship
as
keenly
as
one
of
his
volatile
nature
might
but
i
knew
him
back
on
our
street
the
festival
atmosphere
still
lingered
groups
of
recent
guests
paused
to
discuss
the
astounding
event
the
afternoon
paper
was
being
scanned
by
many
of
them
an
account
of
the
wedding
was
its
feature
as
they
say
i
had
no
heart
for
that
but
on
the
second
page
my
eye
caught
a
minor
item
a
special
meeting
of
the
ladies
onwards
and
upwards
club
is
called
for
afternoon
at
two
sharp
at
the
residence
of
percy
hailey
martingale
for
the
transaction
of
important
one
could
fancy
i
thought
what
the
meeting
would
discuss
nor
was
i
wrong
for
i
may
here
state
that
the
evening
paper
of
the
following
day
disclosed
that
her
ladyship
the
countess
of
brinstead
had
unanimously
been
elected
to
a
life
honorary
membership
in
the
club
back
in
the
grill
i
found
the
work
of
clearing
the
tables
well
advanced
and
very
soon
its
aspect
of
calm
waiting
was
restored
surveying
it
i
reflected
that
one
might
well
wonder
if
aught
momentous
had
indeed
so
lately
occurred
here
a
motley
day
it
had
been
i
passed
into
the
linen
and
glass
pantry
judson
polishing
my
glassware
burst
into
tears
at
my
approach
frankly
stanching
them
with
her
towel
i
saw
it
to
be
a
mere
overflow
of
the
meaningless
emotion
that
women
stock
so
abundantly
on
the
occasion
of
a
wedding
she
is
an
almost
intensely
feminine
person
as
can
be
seen
at
once
by
any
one
who
understands
women
in
a
goods
box
in
the
passage
beyond
i
noted
her
nipper
fast
asleep
a
mammoth
clasped
to
its
fat
chest
i
debated
putting
this
abuse
to
her
once
more
but
feared
the
moment
was
not
propitious
she
dried
her
eyes
and
smiled
again
a
prince
in
his
palace
she
murmured
inanely
she
thought
first
he
was
going
to
be
as
funny
as
the
other
one
then
she
found
he
wasn
t
i
liked
him
too
i
didn
t
blame
her
a
bit
he
s
one
of
that
kind
his
bark
s
worse
than
his
bite
and
to
think
you
knew
all
the
time
what
was
coming
off
my
but
you
re
the
i
saw
no
reason
to
stultify
myself
by
denying
this
i
mean
to
say
if
she
thought
it
let
her
the
last
thing
yesterday
she
gave
me
this
i
had
already
noted
the
very
becoming
dull
blue
house
gown
she
wore
quite
with
an
air
she
carried
it
to
be
sure
it
was
not
suitable
to
her
duties
the
excitements
of
the
day
i
suppose
had
rendered
me
a
bit
sterner
than
is
my
wont
perhaps
a
little
authoritative
a
handsome
gown
i
replied
icily
but
one
would
hardly
choose
it
for
the
work
you
are
rubbish
she
retorted
plainly
i
wanted
to
look
nice
i
had
to
go
in
there
lots
of
times
and
i
wanted
to
be
dressed
for
why
may
i
ask
i
was
all
at
once
uncomfortably
curious
why
the
boys
are
coming
for
me
they
re
going
to
take
home
then
we
re
all
going
to
the
movies
they
ve
got
a
new
bill
at
the
bijou
and
buck
edwards
especially
wants
me
to
see
it
one
of
the
cowboys
in
it
that
does
some
star
riding
looks
just
like
buck
wavy
chestnut
hair
buck
himself
is
one
of
the
best
riders
in
the
whole
the
woman
seemed
to
have
some
fiendish
power
to
enrage
me
as
she
prattled
thus
her
eyes
demurely
on
the
glass
she
dried
i
felt
a
deep
flush
mantle
my
brow
she
could
never
have
dreamed
that
she
had
this
malign
power
but
she
was
now
at
least
to
suspect
it
your
edwards
i
began
calmly
enough
may
be
like
the
cinema
actor
the
two
may
be
as
like
each
other
as
makes
no
difference
but
you
are
not
i
was
aware
that
the
latter
phrase
was
heated
where
i
had
merely
meant
it
to
be
impressive
dignified
firmness
had
been
the
line
i
intended
but
my
rage
was
mounting
she
stared
at
me
astonished
beyond
words
she
was
if
i
can
read
human
expressions
i
am
she
snapped
at
last
you
are
not
i
repeated
stepping
a
bit
toward
her
i
was
conscious
of
a
bit
of
the
rowdy
in
my
manner
but
i
seemed
powerless
to
prevent
it
all
my
culture
was
again
but
the
flimsiest
veneer
i
am
too
she
again
said
though
plainly
dismayed
no
i
quite
thundered
it
i
dare
say
no
no
no
no
the
nipper
cried
out
from
his
box
not
until
later
did
it
occur
to
me
that
he
had
considered
himself
to
be
addressed
in
angry
tones
no
no
i
thundered
again
i
couldn
t
help
myself
though
silly
rot
i
call
it
now
and
then
to
my
horror
the
mother
herself
began
to
weep
i
will
she
sobbed
i
will
i
will
i
will
no
no
i
insisted
and
i
found
myself
seizing
her
shoulders
not
knowing
if
i
mightn
t
shake
her
smartly
so
had
the
woman
got
me
and
still
i
kept
shouting
my
senseless
no
no
at
which
the
nipper
was
now
yelling
she
struggled
her
best
as
i
clutched
her
but
i
seemed
to
have
the
strength
of
a
dozen
men
the
woman
was
nothing
in
my
grasp
and
my
arms
were
taking
their
blind
rage
out
on
her
secure
i
held
her
and
presently
she
no
longer
struggled
and
i
was
curiously
no
longer
angry
but
found
myself
soothing
her
in
many
strange
ways
i
mean
to
say
the
passage
between
us
had
fallen
to
be
of
the
very
shockingly
most
sentimental
character
you
are
so
masterful
she
panted
i
ll
have
my
own
way
i
threatened
i
ve
told
you
often
oh
you
re
so
domineering
she
murmured
i
dare
say
i
am
a
bit
that
way
i
ll
show
you
who
s
to
be
master
but
i
never
dreamed
you
meant
this
she
answered
true
i
had
most
brutally
taken
her
by
surprise
i
could
easily
see
how
expecting
nothing
of
the
faintest
sort
she
had
been
rudely
shocked
i
meant
it
all
along
i
said
firmly
from
the
very
first
and
now
again
she
spoke
in
almost
awed
tones
of
my
i
have
never
believed
in
that
excessive
intuition
which
is
so
widely
boasted
for
woman
i
never
dreamed
of
it
she
said
again
and
added
mrs
kenner
and
i
were
talking
about
this
dress
only
last
night
and
i
said
i
never
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
she
broke
off
with
sudden
inconsequence
as
women
will
we
had
now
to
quiet
the
nipper
in
his
box
i
saw
even
then
that
domineering
though
i
may
be
i
should
probably
never
care
to
bring
the
child
s
condition
to
her
notice
again
there
was
something
about
her
something
volcanic
in
her
femininity
i
knew
it
would
never
do
better
let
the
thing
continue
to
be
a
monstrosity
i
might
unnoticed
of
course
snatch
a
bun
from
its
grasp
now
and
then
our
evening
rush
came
and
went
quite
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
may
have
been
rather
absent
reflecting
pensively
i
mean
to
say
i
had
at
times
considered
this
alliance
as
a
dawning
possibility
but
never
had
i
meant
to
be
sudden
only
for
the
woman
s
remarkably
stubborn
obtuseness
i
dare
say
the
understanding
might
have
been
deferred
to
a
more
suitable
moment
and
arranged
in
a
calm
and
orderly
manner
but
the
die
was
cast
like
his
lordship
i
had
chosen
an
american
bride
taken
her
by
storm
and
carried
her
off
her
feet
before
she
knew
it
we
english
are
often
that
way
at
ten
o
clock
we
closed
the
grill
upon
a
day
that
had
been
historic
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
i
shouldered
the
sleeping
nipper
he
still
passionately
clutched
the
and
for
some
reason
i
felt
averse
to
depriving
him
of
it
even
though
it
would
mean
a
spotty
strangely
enough
we
talked
but
little
in
our
walk
it
seemed
rather
too
tremendous
to
talk
of
when
i
gave
the
child
into
her
arms
at
the
door
it
had
become
half
awake
ruggums
it
muttered
sleepily
ruggums
echoed
the
mother
and
again
very
softly
in
the
still
night
ruggums
ruggums
that
in
the
few
months
since
that
rather
agreeable
night
i
have
acquired
the
title
of
red
gap
s
social
dictator
can
not
be
denied
more
than
one
person
of
discernment
may
now
be
heard
to
speak
of
my
reign
though
this
of
course
is
coming
it
a
bit
thick
the
removal
by
his
lordship
of
one
who
despite
her
sterling
qualities
had
been
a
source
of
discord
left
the
social
elements
of
the
town
in
a
state
of
the
wildest
disorganization
and
having
for
myself
acquired
a
remarkable
prestige
from
my
intimate
association
with
the
affair
i
promptly
seized
the
reins
and
drew
the
scattered
forces
together
first
at
an
early
day
i
sought
an
interview
with
and
effie
and
told
them
straight
precisely
why
i
had
played
them
both
false
in
the
matter
of
the
wedding
breakfast
with
the
honour
granted
to
either
of
them
i
explained
i
had
foreseen
another
era
of
cliques
divisions
and
acrimony
therefore
i
had
done
the
thing
myself
as
a
measure
of
peace
flatly
then
i
declared
my
intention
of
reconciling
all
those
formerly
opposed
elements
and
of
creating
a
society
in
red
gap
that
would
be
a
social
union
in
the
finest
sense
of
the
word
i
said
that
contact
with
their
curious
american
life
had
taught
me
that
their
equality
should
be
more
than
a
name
and
that
especially
in
the
younger
settlements
a
certain
relaxation
from
the
rigid
requirements
of
an
older
order
is
not
only
unavoidable
but
vastly
to
be
desired
i
meant
to
say
if
we
were
going
to
be
americans
it
was
silly
rot
trying
to
be
english
at
the
same
time
i
pointed
out
that
their
former
social
leaders
had
ever
been
inspired
by
the
idea
of
exclusion
the
soul
of
their
leadership
had
been
to
cast
others
out
and
that
the
campaign
i
planned
was
to
be
one
of
inclusion
even
to
the
extent
of
bohemians
and
i
believed
to
be
in
the
finest
harmony
with
their
north
american
theory
of
human
association
it
might
be
thought
a
na√Øve
theory
i
said
but
so
long
as
they
had
chosen
it
i
should
staunchly
abide
by
it
i
added
what
i
dare
say
they
did
not
believe
that
the
position
of
leader
was
not
one
i
should
cherish
for
any
other
reason
than
the
public
good
that
when
one
better
fitted
might
appear
they
would
find
me
the
first
to
rejoice
i
need
not
say
that
i
was
interrupted
frequently
and
acridly
during
this
harangue
but
i
had
given
them
both
a
buffalo
and
well
they
knew
it
and
i
worked
swiftly
from
that
moment
i
gave
the
following
week
the
first
of
a
series
of
subscription
balls
in
the
dancing
hall
above
the
grill
and
both
and
effie
early
enrolled
themselves
as
patronesses
even
after
i
had
made
it
plain
that
i
alone
should
name
the
guests
the
success
of
the
affair
was
all
i
could
have
wished
red
gap
had
become
a
social
unit
nor
was
appreciation
for
my
leadership
wanting
there
will
be
malcontents
i
foresee
and
from
the
informed
inner
circles
i
learn
that
i
have
already
been
slightingly
spoken
of
as
a
foreigner
wielding
a
sceptre
over
americans
but
i
have
the
support
of
quite
all
who
really
matter
and
i
am
confident
these
rebellions
may
be
put
down
by
tact
alone
it
is
too
well
understood
by
those
who
know
me
that
i
have
equality
for
my
watchword
i
mean
to
say
at
the
next
ball
of
the
series
i
may
even
see
that
the
fellow
hobbs
has
a
card
if
i
can
become
assured
that
he
has
quite
freed
himself
from
certain
debasing
of
his
native
country
this
to
be
sure
is
an
extreme
case
because
the
fellow
is
that
type
of
our
serving
class
to
whom
equality
is
unthinkable
they
must
from
their
centuries
of
servility
look
either
up
or
down
and
i
scarce
know
in
which
attitude
they
are
more
offensive
to
our
american
point
of
view
still
i
mean
to
be
broad
even
hobbs
shall
have
his
chance
with
us
it
is
late
june
ruggles
and
i
are
comfortably
installed
in
her
enlarged
and
repaired
house
we
have
a
on
a
stretch
of
her
and
the
thrives
under
the
care
of
the
japanese
agricultural
labourer
i
have
employed
already
i
have
discharged
more
than
half
my
debt
to
cousin
egbert
who
exclaims
oh
shucks
each
time
i
make
him
a
payment
he
and
the
honourable
george
remain
pally
no
end
and
spend
much
of
their
abundant
leisure
at
cousin
egbert
s
modest
country
house
at
times
when
they
are
in
town
they
rather
consort
with
street
persons
but
such
is
the
breadth
of
our
social
scheme
that
i
shall
never
exclude
them
from
our
gayeties
though
it
is
true
that
more
often
than
not
they
decline
to
be
present
ruggles
i
may
say
is
a
lady
of
quite
amazing
capacities
combined
strangely
with
the
commonest
feminine
weaknesses
she
has
acute
business
judgment
at
most
times
yet
would
fly
at
me
in
a
rage
if
i
were
to
say
what
i
think
of
the
nipper
s
appalling
grossness
quite
naturally
i
do
not
push
my
unquestioned
mastery
to
this
extreme
there
are
other
matters
in
which
i
amusedly
let
her
have
her
way
though
she
fondly
reminds
me
almost
daily
of
my
brutal
on
one
point
i
have
just
been
obliged
to
assert
this
she
came
running
to
me
with
a
suggestion
for
economizing
in
the
manufacture
of
the
relish
she
had
devised
a
cheaper
formula
but
i
was
firm
so
long
as
the
inventor
s
face
is
on
that
flask
i
said
its
contents
shall
not
be
debased
a
tuppence
my
name
and
face
will
guarantee
its
she
gave
in
nicely
merely
declaring
that
i
needn
t
growl
like
one
of
their
bears
with
a
painful
foot
at
my
carefully
mild
suggestion
she
has
just
brought
the
nipper
in
from
where
he
was
cattying
the
young
fowls
much
to
their
detriment
but
she
is
now
heaping
compote
upon
a
slice
of
thickly
buttered
bread
for
him
glancing
meanwhile
at
our
evening
newspaper
ruggums
always
has
his
awful
own
way
doesn
t
ums
she
remarks
to
the
nipper
deeply
ignoring
this
i
resume
my
elocutionary
studies
of
the
declaration
of
independence
for
i
should
say
that
a
signal
honour
of
a
municipal
character
has
just
been
done
me
a
committee
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
has
invited
me
to
participate
in
their
exercises
on
an
early
day
in
july
the
fourth
i
fancy
when
they
celebrate
the
issuance
of
this
famous
document
i
have
been
asked
to
read
it
preceding
a
patriotic
address
to
be
made
by
senator
floud
i
accepted
with
the
utmost
pleasure
and
now
on
my
porch
have
begun
trying
it
out
for
the
proper
voice
effects
its
substance
i
need
not
say
is
already
familiar
to
me
the
nipper
is
horribly
gulping
at
its
food
jam
smears
quite
all
about
its
countenance
ruggles
glances
over
her
journal
how
would
you
like
it
she
suddenly
demands
if
i
went
around
town
like
these
english
women
burning
churches
and
houses
of
parliament
and
cutting
up
fine
oil
paintings
how
would
that
suit
your
grouchy
highness
this
is
not
england
i
answer
shortly
that
sort
of
thing
would
never
do
with
my
but
isn
t
he
the
fierce
old
ruggums
she
cries
in
affected
alarm
to
the
now
nipper
once
more
i
take
up
the
declaration
of
independence
it
lends
itself
rather
well
to
reciting
i
feel
that
my
voice
is
going
to
carry
the
end
