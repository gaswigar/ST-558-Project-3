i
miriam
left
the
gaslit
hall
and
went
slowly
upstairs
the
march
twilight
lay
upon
the
landings
but
the
staircase
was
almost
dark
the
top
landing
was
quite
dark
and
silent
there
was
no
one
about
it
would
be
quiet
in
her
room
she
could
sit
by
the
fire
and
be
quiet
and
think
things
over
until
eve
and
harriett
came
back
with
the
parcels
she
would
have
time
to
think
about
the
journey
and
decide
what
she
was
going
to
say
to
the
fraulein
her
new
saratoga
trunk
stood
solid
and
gleaming
in
the
firelight
it
would
be
taken
away
and
she
would
be
gone
the
room
would
be
altogether
harriett
s
it
would
never
have
its
old
look
again
she
evaded
the
thought
and
moved
clumsily
to
the
nearest
window
the
outline
of
the
round
bed
and
the
shapes
of
the
on
either
side
of
the
bend
of
the
drive
were
just
visible
there
was
no
escape
for
her
thoughts
in
this
direction
the
sense
of
all
she
was
leaving
stirred
uncontrollably
as
she
stood
looking
down
into
the
garden
out
in
the
road
beyond
the
invisible
came
the
rumble
of
wheels
the
gate
creaked
and
the
wheels
crunched
up
the
drive
slurring
and
stopping
under
the
window
it
was
the
thursday
afternoon
the
one
that
was
always
in
tune
it
was
early
she
drew
back
from
the
window
as
the
bass
chords
began
thumping
gently
in
the
darkness
it
was
better
that
it
should
come
now
than
later
on
at
dinnertime
she
could
get
over
it
alone
up
here
she
went
down
the
length
of
the
room
and
knelt
by
the
fireside
with
one
hand
on
the
so
that
she
could
get
up
noiselessly
and
be
lighting
the
gas
if
anyone
came
in
the
organ
was
playing
the
wearin
o
the
it
had
begun
that
tune
during
the
last
term
at
school
in
the
summer
it
made
her
think
of
rounders
in
the
hot
school
garden
in
the
large
green
room
all
the
class
shouting
gather
roses
while
ye
may
hot
afternoons
in
the
shady
north
room
the
sound
of
turning
pages
the
hum
of
the
garden
beyond
the
meetings
in
the
sixth
form
study
lilla
with
her
black
hair
and
the
specks
of
bright
amber
in
the
brown
of
her
eyes
talking
about
she
stirred
the
fire
the
windows
were
quite
dark
the
flames
shot
up
and
shadows
darted
that
summer
which
still
seemed
near
to
her
was
going
to
fade
and
desert
her
leaving
nothing
behind
it
would
belong
to
a
world
which
would
go
on
without
her
taking
no
heed
there
would
still
be
blissful
days
but
she
would
not
be
in
them
there
would
be
no
more
silent
sunny
mornings
with
all
the
day
ahead
and
nothing
to
do
and
no
end
anywhere
to
anything
no
more
sitting
at
the
open
window
in
the
reading
lecky
and
darwin
and
bound
contemporary
reviews
with
roses
waiting
in
the
garden
to
be
worn
in
the
afternoon
and
eve
and
harriett
somewhere
about
washing
blouses
or
copying
waltzes
from
the
library
packet
no
more
harriett
looking
in
at
the
end
of
the
morning
rushing
her
off
to
the
new
grand
piano
to
play
the
mikado
and
the
holy
family
duets
the
would
go
on
but
she
would
not
be
there
it
would
begin
in
may
again
there
would
be
a
white
twinkling
figure
coming
quickly
along
the
pathway
between
the
rows
of
every
saturday
afternoon
why
had
he
come
to
tea
every
sunday
never
missing
a
single
sunday
all
the
winter
why
did
he
say
play
abide
with
me
play
abide
with
me
yesterday
if
he
didn
t
care
what
was
the
good
of
being
so
quiet
and
saying
nothing
why
didn
t
he
say
don
t
go
or
when
are
you
coming
back
eve
said
he
looked
perfectly
miserable
there
was
nothing
to
look
forward
to
now
but
governessing
and
old
age
perhaps
miss
gilkes
was
right
get
rid
of
men
and
muddles
and
have
things
just
ordinary
and
be
happy
make
up
your
mind
to
be
happy
you
can
be
happy
without
anyone
to
think
about
wearing
that
large
cameo
brooch
long
white
hands
and
that
quiet
little
laugh
the
had
reached
its
last
tune
in
the
midst
of
the
final
flourish
of
notes
the
door
flew
open
miriam
got
quickly
to
her
feet
and
felt
for
matches
harriett
came
in
waggling
a
thin
brown
paper
parcel
did
you
hear
the
intermezzo
what
a
dim
religious
we
got
your
old
miriam
took
the
parcel
and
subsided
on
to
the
hearthrug
looking
with
a
new
curiosity
at
harriett
s
little
round
firelit
face
smiling
tightly
beneath
the
rim
of
her
hard
felt
hat
and
the
bright
silk
bow
beneath
her
chin
a
footstep
sounded
on
the
landing
and
there
was
a
gentle
tap
on
the
open
door
oh
come
in
eve
bring
some
matches
are
the
collars
piquet
harry
no
they
hadn
t
got
piquet
but
they
re
the
plain
shape
you
like
you
may
thank
us
they
didn
t
send
you
things
with
little
rujabiba
eve
came
slenderly
down
the
room
and
miriam
saw
with
relief
that
her
outdoor
things
were
off
as
the
gas
flared
up
she
drew
comfort
from
her
scarlet
serge
dress
and
the
soft
crimson
cheek
and
white
brow
of
the
profile
raised
towards
the
flaring
jet
what
are
things
like
downstairs
she
said
staring
into
the
fire
i
don
t
know
said
eve
she
sighed
thoughtfully
and
sank
into
a
carpet
chair
under
the
gas
bracket
miriam
glanced
at
her
troubled
eyes
pater
s
only
just
come
in
i
think
things
are
pretty
rotten
declared
harriett
from
the
hearthrug
isn
t
it
ghastly
for
all
of
us
miriam
felt
treacherously
outspoken
it
was
a
relief
to
be
going
away
she
knew
that
this
sense
of
relief
made
her
able
to
speak
it
s
never
knowing
that
s
so
awful
perhaps
he
ll
get
some
more
money
presently
and
things
ll
go
on
again
fancy
mother
having
it
always
ever
since
we
were
don
t
all
right
i
won
t
tell
you
the
words
he
said
how
he
put
it
about
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
money
for
my
miriam
s
mind
went
back
to
the
phrase
and
her
mother
s
agonised
face
she
felt
utterly
desolate
in
the
warm
room
i
wish
got
brains
chirped
harriett
poking
the
fire
with
the
toe
of
her
boot
so
you
have
more
than
oh
you
know
i
girls
that
things
are
as
absolutely
ghastly
this
time
as
they
can
possibly
be
and
that
something
must
be
done
but
you
know
it
s
perfectly
fearful
to
face
that
old
school
when
it
comes
to
the

into

fire
and
began
to

gentle
scale

her
tiny
blue
and

knee

things

things

there

miriam
pursed
her
lips
to
a
tight
bunch
and
sat
twisting
her
long
thickish
fingers
eve
stood
up
in
her
tears
her
smile
and
the
curves
of
her
mouth
were
unchanged
by
her
weeping
and
the
crimson
had
spread
and
deepened
a
little
in
the
long
oval
of
her
face
miriam
watched
the
changing
crimson
her
eyes
went
to
and
fro
between
it
and
the
neatly
pinned
masses
of
brown
hair
i
m
going
to
get
some
hot
water
said
eve
and
we
ll
make
ourselves
miriam
watched
her
as
she
went
down
the
long
room
the
great
oval
of
dark
hair
the
narrow
neck
the
narrow
back
tight
plump
little
hands
hanging
in
profile
white
with
a
purple
pad
near
the
wrist
when
miriam
woke
the
next
morning
she
lay
still
with
closed
eyes
she
had
dreamed
that
she
had
been
standing
in
a
room
in
the
german
school
and
the
staff
had
crowded
round
her
looking
at
her
they
had
dreadful
eyes
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
hostesses
she
remembered
eyes
she
had
seen
in
trains
and
buses
eyes
from
the
old
school
they
came
and
stood
and
looked
at
her
and
saw
her
as
she
was
without
courage
without
funds
or
good
clothes
or
beauty
without
charm
or
interest
without
even
the
skill
to
play
a
part
they
looked
at
her
with
loathing
board
and
lodging
privilege
to
attend
masters
lectures
and
laundry
only
that
was
all
she
had
thought
of
and
clutched
at
all
along
since
first
she
read
the
fraulein
s
letter
her
keep
and
the
chance
of
learning
and
germany
germany
das
deutsche
vaterland
germany
all
woods
and
mountains
and
tenderness
hermann
and
dorothea
in
the
dusk
of
a
happy
village
and
it
would
really
be
those
women
expecting
things
of
her
they
would
be
so
affable
at
first
she
had
been
through
it
a
million
times
all
her
life
all
eternity
they
would
smile
those
hateful
women
s
smiles
smirks
smiles
as
if
everybody
were
agreed
about
everything
she
loathed
women
they
always
smiled
all
the
teachers
had
at
school
all
the
girls
but
lilla
eve
did
maddeningly
sometimes
mother
it
was
the
only
funny
horrid
thing
about
her
harriett
didn
t
harriett
laughed
she
was
strong
and
hard
somehow
pater
knew
how
hateful
all
the
world
of
women
were
and
despised
them
he
never
included
her
with
them
or
only
sometimes
when
she
pretended
or
he
didn
t
understand
someone
was
saying
hi
a
gurgling
muffled
shout
a
long
way
off
she
opened
her
eyes
it
was
bright
morning
she
saw
the
twist
of
harriett
s
body
lying
across
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
a
gasp
she
flung
herself
over
her
own
side
harry
old
harry
jolly
old
harry
had
remembered
the
grand
ceremonial
in
a
moment
her
own
head
hung
her
long
hair
flinging
back
on
to
the
floor
her
eyes
gazing
across
the
bed
at
the
reversed
snub
of
harriett
s
face
it
was
flushed
in
the
midst
of
the
wiry
hair
which
stuck
out
all
round
it
but
did
not
reach
the
floor
hi
they
gurgled
solemnly
hi
hi
shaking
their
heads
from
side
to
side
then
their
four
frilled
hands
came
down
and
they
flumped
out
of
the
high
bed
they
performed
an
uproarious
toilet
it
seemed
so
safe
up
there
in
the
bright
bare
room
miriam
s
luggage
had
been
removed
it
was
away
somewhere
in
the
house
far
away
and
unreal
and
unfelt
as
her
parents
somewhere
downstairs
and
the
servants
away
in
the
basement
getting
breakfast
and
sarah
and
eve
always
incredible
getting
quietly
up
in
the
next
room
nothing
was
real
but
getting
up
with
old
harriett
in
this
old
room
she
revelled
in
harriett
s
delicate
buffoonery
voluntary
incongruity
she
quoted
to
herself
as
she
watched
her
the
titles
of
some
of
the
books
on
harriett
s
shelf
ungava
a
tale
of
the
north
grimm
s
fairy
tales
john
halifax
swiss
family
robinson
made
her
laugh
the
curtained
recesses
of
the
long
room
stretched
away
into
space
she
went
about
dimpling
and
responding
singing
and
masquerading
as
her
large
hands
did
their
work
she
intoned
the
titles
on
her
own
shelf
as
a
response
to
the
quiet
swearing
and
jesting
accompanying
harriett
s
occupations
the
voyage
of
the
beeeeeeagle
she
sang
scott
s
poetical
villette
longfellow
holy
bible
apocrypha
egmont
binks
squealed
harriett
daintily
yink
grink
books
she
responded
in
a
low
tone
and
flushed
as
if
she
had
given
harriett
an
affectionate
hug
my
rotten
books
she
would
come
back
and
read
all
her
books
more
carefully
she
had
packed
some
she
could
not
remember
which
and
why
binks
she
said
and
it
was
quite
easy
for
them
to
crowd
together
at
the
little
harriett
was
standing
in
her
little
faded
red
moirette
petticoat
and
a
blue
flannelette
brushing
her
wiry
hair
miriam
reflected
that
she
need
no
longer
hate
her
for
the
set
of
her
clothes
round
her
hips
she
caught
sight
of
her

faded
jersey
and
stiff
shapeless
black
petticoat
in
the
mirror
harriett
s
hinde
s
lay
on
the
her
own
still
lifted
the
skin
of
her
forehead
in
suffused
puckerings
against
the
shank
of
each
pin
unperceived
she
eyed
the
tiny
stiff
plait
of
hair
which
stuck
out
almost
horizontally
from
the
nape
of
harriett
s
neck
and
watched
her
combing
out
the
fringe
standing
stubbily
out
along
her
forehead
and
extending
like
a
thickset
hedge
midway
across
the
crown
of
her
head
where
it
stopped
abruptly
against
the
longer
strands
which
strained
over
her
poll
and
disappeared
into
the
plait
your
old
wool
ll
be
just
right
in
germany
remarked
harriett
you
ought
to
do
it
in
basket
plaits
like
i
wish
i
could
i
can
t
think
how
she
does
ike
spect
it
s
easy
but
you
re
all
right
anyhow
it
s
no
good
bothering
when
you
re
you
re
miriam
looked
sharply
round
go
on
you
re
not
you
don
t
know
granny
said
you
ll

a
bonny
woman
and
sarah
thinks
you

got
the
best
shape
face
and
the
best
complexion
of
any
of
us
and
cook
was
simply
crying
her
eyes
out
last
night
and
said
you
were
the
light
of
the
house
with
your
happy
pretty
face
and
mother
said
you
re
much
too
attractive
to
go
about
alone
and
that
s
partly
why
pater
s
going
with
you
to
hanover
silly
you
re
not
plain
she
gasped
miriam
s
amazement
silenced
her
she
stood
back
from
the
mirror
she
could
not
look
into
it
until
harriett
had
gone
the
phrases
she
had
just
heard
rang
in
her
head
without
meaning
but
she
knew
she
would
remember
all
of
them
she
went
on
doing
her
hair
with
downcast
eyes
she
had
seen
harriett
vividly
and
had
longed
to
crush
her
in
her
arms
and
kiss
her
little
round
cheeks
and
the
snub
of
her
nose
then
she
wanted
her
to
be
gone
presently
harriett
took
up
a
brooch
and
skated
down
the
room
she
carolled
don
t
be
long
and
disappeared
i
m
pretty
murmured
miriam
planting
herself
in
front
of
the
i
m
pretty
they
like
me
they
me
why
didn
t
i
know
she
did
not
look
into
the
mirror
they
all
like
me
the
sound
of
the
came
clanging
up
through
the
house
she
hurried
to
her
side
of
the
curtained
recess
hanging
there
were
her
old
red
stockinette
jersey
and
her
blue
skirt
never
again
just
once
more
she
could
change
afterwards
her
brown
heavy
best
dress
with
puffed
and
gauged
sleeves
and
thick
gauged
and
gathered
boned
bodice
was
in
her
hand
she
hung
it
once
more
on
its
peg
and
quickly
put
on
her
old
things
the
jersey
was
shiny
with
wear
you
darling
old
things
she
muttered
as
her
arms
slipped
down
the
sleeves
the
door
of
the
next
room
opened
quietly
and
she
heard
sarah
and
eve
go
decorously
downstairs
she
waited
until
their
footsteps
had
died
away
and
then
went
very
slowly
down
the
first
flight
fastening
her
belt
she
stopped
at
the
landing
window
tucking
the
frayed
end
of
the
petersham
under
the
frame
of
the
buckle
they
were
all
downstairs
liking
her
she
could
not
face
them
she
was
too
excited
and
too
shy
she
had
never
once
thought
of
their
feeling
her
going
away
saying
goodbye
to
each
one
all
minding
and
sorry
even
the
servants
she
glanced
fearfully
out
into
the
garden
seeing
nothing
someone
called
up
from
the
doorway
mim
my
how
surprised
bart
had
been
when
he
discovered
that
they
themselves
never
knew
whose
voice
it
was
of
all
four
of
them
unless
you
saw
the
person
but
yours
is
really
richer
it
was
cheek
to
say
that
mimm
my
suddenly
she
longed
to
be
gone
to
have
it
all
over
and
be
gone
she
heard
the
of
harriett
s
wooden
heeled
slippers
across
the
tiled
hall
she
glanced
down
the
well
of
the
staircase
harriett
was
mightily
swinging
the
bell
scattering
a
little
spray
of
notes
at
each
end
of
her
swing
with
a
frightened
face
miriam
crept
back
up
the
stairs
violently
slamming
the
bedroom
door
i
m
i
m
she
shouted
and
ran
downstairs
chapter
ii
the
crossing
was
over
they
were
arriving
the
movement
of
the
little
steamer
that
had
collected
the
passengers
from
the
drove
the
raw
air
against
miriam
s
face
in
her
tired
brain
the
grey
river
and
the
flat
misty
shores
slid
constantly
into
a
vision
of
the
gaslit
at
home
the
large
clear
glowing
fire
the
sounds
of
the
family
voices
every
effort
to
obliterate
the
picture
brought
back
again
the
moment
that
had
come
at
the
as
they
all
sat
silent
for
an
instant
with
downcast
eyes
and
she
had
suddenly
longed
to
go
on
for
ever
just
sitting
there
with
them
all
now
in
the
boat
she
wanted
to
be
free
for
the
strange
grey
river
and
the
grey
shores
but
the
home
scenes
recurred
relentlessly
again
and
again
she
went
through
the
last
moments
the
goodbyes
the
unexpected
convulsive
force
of
her
mother
s
arms
her
own
dreadful
inability
to
give
any
answering
embrace
she
could
not
remember
saying
a
single
word
there
had
been
a
feeling
that
came
like
a
tide
carrying
her
away
eager
and
dumb
and
remorseful
she
had
gone
out
of
the
house
and
into
the
cab
with
sarah
and
then
had
come
the
long
sitting
in
the
train
talk
about
something
sarah
sitting
opposite
and
her
unchanged
voice
saying
what
shall
we
talk
about
and
then
a
long
waiting
and
the
brown
leather
strap
swinging
against
the
yellow
grained
door
the
smell
of
dust
and
the
dirty
wooden
flooring
with
the
noise
of
the
wheels
underneath
going
to
the
swinging
tune
of
one
of
heller
s
sleepless
the
train
had
made
her
sway
with
its
movements
how
still
sarah
seemed
to
sit
fixed
in
the
old
life
nothing
had
come
but
strange
cruel
emotions
after
the
suburban
train
nothing
was
distinct
until
the
warm
snowflakes
were
drifting
against
her
face
through
the
cold
darkness
on
harwich
quay
then
after
what
seemed
like
a
great
loop
of
time
spent
going
helplessly
up
a
gangway
towards
the
world
she
had
stood
face
to
face
with
the
pale
polite
stewardess
in
her
cabin
i
had
better
have
a
lemon
cut
in
two
she
had
said
feeling
suddenly
stifled
with
fear
for
hours
she
had
lain
despairing
watching
the
slowly
swaying
walls
of
her
cabin
or
sinking
with
closed
eyes
through
invertebrate
dipping
spaces
before
each
releasing
paroxysm
she
told
herself
this
is
like
death
one
day
i
shall
die
it
will
be
like
she
supposed
there
would
be
breakfast
soon
on
shore
a
firm
room
and
a
teapot
and
cups
and
saucers
cold
and
exhaustion
would
come
to
an
end
she
would
be
talking
to
her
father
he
was
standing
near
her
with
the
dutchman
who
had
helped
her
off
the
boat
and
looked
after
her
luggage
the
dutchman
was
listening
deferentially
miriam
saw
the
strong
dark
blue
beam
of
his
eyes
very
good
very
good
she
heard
him
say
fine
education
in
german
both
men
were
smoking
cigars
she
wanted
to
draw
herself
upright
and
shake
out
her
clothes
select
she
heard
excellent
staff
of
masters
daughters
of
pater
is
trying
to
make
the
dutchman
think
i
am
being
taken
as
a
pupil
to
a
finishing
school
in
she
thought
of
her
lonely
pilgrimage
to
the
west
end
agency
of
her
humiliating
interview
of
her
acceptance
of
the
post
the
excitements
and
misgivings
she
had
had
of
her
sudden
challenge
of
them
all
that
evening
after
dinner
and
their
dismay
and
remonstrance
and
reproaches
of
her
fear
and
determination
in
insisting
and
carrying
her
point
and
making
them
begin
to
be
interested
in
her
plan
but
she
shared
her
father
s
satisfaction
in
impressing
the
dutchman
she
knew
that
she
was
at
one
with
him
in
that
she
glanced
at
him
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
playing
the
role
of
the
english
gentleman
poor
dear
it
was
what
he
had
always
wanted
to
be
he
had
sacrificed
everything
to
the
idea
of
being
a
person
of
leisure
and
well
after
all
it
was
true
in
a
way
he
was
and
he
had
she
knew
always
wanted
her
to
be
the
same
and
she
going
to
finish
her
education
abroad
in
germany
they
were
nearing
a
little
low
quay
backed
by
a
tremendous
hoarding
announcing
in
black
letters
sunlight
did
you
see
pater
did
you
they
were
walking
rapidly
along
the
quay
did
you
see
sunlight
she
listened
to
his
slightly
scuffling
stride
at
her
side
glancing
up
she
saw
his
face
excited
and
important
he
was
not
listening
he
was
being
an
english
gentleman
emerging
from
the
dutch
railway
station
sunlight
she
shouted
pater
he
glanced
down
at
her
and
smiled
condescendingly
ah
yes
he
admitted
with
a
laugh
there
were
dutch
faces
for
miriam
men
women
and
children
coming
towards
her
with
sturdy
gait
they
re
talking
dutch
they
re
all
talking
the
foreign
voices
the
echoes
in
the
little
narrow
street
the
flat
waterside
effect
of
the
sounds
the
bright
clearness
she
had
read
of
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
the
others
come
here
she
told
herself
pitying
them
all
they
had
an
english
breakfast
at
the
victoria
hotel
and
went
out
and
hurried
about
the
little
streets
they
bought
cigars
and
rode
through
the
town
on
a
little
tramway
presently
they
were
in
a
train
watching
the
dutch
landscape
go
by
one
level
stretch
succeeded
another
miriam
wanted
to
go
out
alone
under
the
grey
sky
and
walk
over
the
flat
fields
shut
in
by
poplars
she
looked
at
the
dykes
and
the
windmills
with
indifferent
eyes
but
her
desire
for
the
flat
meadows
grew
late
at
night
seated
opposite
her
sleeping
companion
rushing
towards
the
german
city
she
began
to
think
it
was
a
fool
s
errand
to
undertake
to
go
to
the
german
school
and
teach
to
be
going
there
with
nothing
to
give
the
moment
would
come
when
there
would
be
a
class
sitting
round
a
table
waiting
for
her
to
speak
she
imagined
one
of
the
rooms
at
the
old
school
full
of
scornful
girls
how
was
english
taught
how
did
you
begin
english
grammar
in
german
her
heart
beat
in
her
throat
she
had
never
thought
of
that
the
rules
of
english
grammar
parsing
and
analysis
prefixes
and
suffixes
gerundial
infinitive
it
was
too
late
to
look
anything
up
perhaps
there
would
be
a
class
the
german
lessons
at
school
had
been
dreadfully
good
fraulein
s
grave
face
her
perfect
knowledge
of
every
rule
her
clear
explanations
in
english
her
examples
all
these
things
were
there
in
english
grammar
and
she
had
undertaken
to
teach
them
and
could
not
even
speak
german
monsieur
had
talked
french
all
the
time
dictees
lectures
le
conscrit
waterloo
la
maison
deserte
his
careful
voice
reading
on
and
on
until
the
room
she
must
do
that
for
her
german
girls
read
english
to
them
and
make
them
happy
but
first
there
must
be
verbs
there
had
been
cahiers
of
them
first
second
third
conjugation
it
was
impudence
an
impudent
invasion
the
dreadful
clever
foreign
school
they
would
laugh
at
her
she
began
to
repeat
the
english
alphabet
she
doubted
whether
faced
with
a
class
she
could
reach
the
end
without
a
mistake
she
reached
z
and
went
on
to
the
parts
of
speech
there
would
be
a
moment
when
she
must
have
an
explanation
with
the
fraulein
perhaps
she
could
tell
her
that
she
found
the
teaching
was
beyond
her
scope
and
then
find
a
place
somewhere
as
a
servant
she
remembered
things
she
had
heard
about
german
servants
that
whenever
they
even
dusted
a
room
they
cleaned
the
windows
and
on
sundays
they
waited
at
lunch
in
muslin
dresses
and
afterwards
went
to
balls
she
feared
even
the
german
servants
would
despise
her
they
had
never
been
allowed
into
the
kitchen
at
home
except
when
there
was
she
had
never
made
a
bed
in
her
life
a
shop
but
that
would
mean
knowing
german
and
being
quick
at
giving
change
impossible
perhaps
she
could
find
some
english
people
in
hanover
who
would
help
her
there
was
an
english
colony
she
knew
and
an
english
church
but
that
would
be
like
going
back
that
must
not
happen
she
would
rather
stay
abroad
on
any
terms
away
from
england
english
people
she
had
scented
something
a
sort
of
confidence
everywhere
in
her
hours
in
holland
the
brisk
manner
of
the
german
railway
officials
and
the
serene
assurance
of
the
travelling
germans
she
had
seen
confirmed
her
impression
away
out
here
the
sense
of
imminent
catastrophe
that
had
shadowed
all
her
life
so
far
had
disappeared
even
here
in
this
dim
carriage
with
disgrace
ahead
she
felt
that
there
was
freedom
somewhere
at
hand
whatever
happened
she
would
hold
to
that
she
glanced
up
at
her
small
leather
handbag
lying
in
the
rack
and
thought
of
the
solid
money
in
her
purse
shillings
it
was
a
large
sum
and
she
was
to
have
more
as
she
needed
she
glanced
across
at
the
pale
face
with
its
point
of
reddish
beard
the
long
white
hands
laid
one
upon
the
other
on
the
crossed
knees
he
had
given
her
shillings
and
there
was
her
fare
and
his
and
his
return
fare
and
her
new
trunk
and
all
the
things
she
had
needed
it
must
be
the
end
of
taking
money
from
him
she
was
grown
up
she
was
the
one
she
must
manage
with
a
false
position
ahead
and
after
a
short
space
disaster
she
must
get
along
the
peaceful
dutch
fields
came
to
her
mind
they
looked
so
secure
they
had
passed
by
too
soon
we
have
always
been
in
a
false
position
she
pondered
always
lying
and
pretending
and
keeping
up
a
show
never
daring
to
tell
anybody
did
she
want
to
tell
anybody
to
come
out
into
the
open
and
be
helped
and
have
things
arranged
for
her
and
do
things
like
other
people
no
no
miriam
always
likes
to
be
different
society
is
no
boon
to
those
not
dreadful
things
and
the
girls
laughing
together
about
them
what
did
they
really
mean
society
is
no
boon
to
those
not
sociable
on
her
in
ellen
sharpe
s
ellen
handed
it
to
her
going
upstairs
and
had
chanted
the
words
out
to
the
others
and
smiled
her
smile
she
had
not
asked
her
to
write
her
name
was
it
unsociable
to
dislike
so
many
of
the
girls
ellen
s
people
were
in
the
indian
her
thoughts
hesitated
sivvle
something
grand
all
the
grand
girls
were
horrid
somehow
mean
and
sly
sivvle
of
course
civil
miriam
groaned
she
was
a
governess
now
someone
would
ask
her
that
question
she
would
ask
pater
before
he
went
no
she
would
not
if
only
he
would
answer
a
question
simply
and
not
with
a
superior
air
as
if
he
had
invented
the
thing
he
was
telling
about
she
felt
she
had
a
right
to
all
the
knowledge
there
was
without
fuss
oh
without
fuss
without
fuss
and
emotion
i
unsociable
i
suppose
she
mused
she
could
not
think
of
anyone
who
did
not
offend
her
i
don
t
like
men
and
i
loathe
women
i
am
a
misanthrope
so
s
pater
he
despises
women
and
can
t
get
on
with
men
we
are
different
it
s
us
him
and
me
he
s
failed
us
because
he
s
different
and
if
he
weren
t
we
should
be
like
other
people
everything
in
the
railway
responded
and
agreed
like
other
people
horrible
she
thought
of
the
fathers
of
girls
she
knew
the
poole
girls
for
instance
they
were
to
be
independent
trained
and
certificated
she
envied
that
but
her
envy
vanished
when
she
remembered
how
heartily
she
had
agreed
when
sarah
called
them
sharp
and
poole
was
a
business
man
common
trade
if
pater
had
kept
to
grandpa
s

miriam
was
practising
on
the
piano
in
the
larger
of
the
two
english
bedrooms
two
other
pianos
were
sounding
in
the
house
one
across
the
landing
and
the
other
in
the
saal
where
herr
kapellmeister
bossenberger
was
giving
a
the
rest
of
the
girls
were
gathered
in
the
large
schoolroom
under
the
care
of
mademoiselle
for
saturday
s
it
was
the
last
hour
of
the
week
s
work
presently
there
would
be
a
great
gonging
the
pianos
would
cease
fraulein
s
voice
would
sound
up
through
the
house
anziehen

there
would
be
the

dinner
the
saturday
afternoon
to
be
written
and
then
until
monday
holiday
freedom
to
read
and
to
talk
english
and
idle
and
there
was
a
new
arrival
in
the
house
ulrica
hesse
had
come
miriam
had
seen
her
there
had
been
three
large
leather
trunks
in
the
hall
and
a
girl
with
a
smooth
pure
oval
of
pale
face
standing
wrapped
in
dark
furs
gazing
about
her
with
eyes
for
which
miriam
had
no
word
liquid
limpid
no
pools
great
round
deeps
she
had
felt
about
for
something
to
express
them
as
she
went
upstairs
with
her
roll
of
music
fraulein
pfaff
who
had
seemed
to
hover
and
smile
about
the
girl
as
if
half
afraid
to
speak
to
her
had
put
out
a
hand
for
miriam
and
said
almost
deprecatingly
ach
mm
dies
ist
unser
the
girl
s
thin
fingers
had
come
out
of
her
furs
and
fastened
convulsively
like
cold
throbbing
claws
on
to
the
breadth
of
miriam
s
hand
unsere
englische
lehrerin
our
teacher
from
england
smiled
fraulein
lehrerin
breathed
the
girl
something
flinched
behind
her
great
eyes
the
fingers
relaxed
and
miriam
feeling
within
her
a
beginning
of
response
had
gone
upstairs
as
she
reached
the
upper
landing
she
began
to
distinguish
against
the
clangour
of
chromatic
passages
assailing
the
house
from
the
echoing
saal
the
gentle
tones
of
the
nearer
piano
the
one
in
the
larger
german
bedroom
opposite
the
front
room
for
which
she
was
bound
she
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
listened
a
little
swaying
melody
came
out
to
her
muted
by
the
closed
door
her
grasp
on
the
roll
of
music
slackened
a
radiance
came
for
a
moment
behind
the
gravity
of
her
face
then
the
careful
unstumbling
repetition
of
a
difficult
passage
drew
her
attention
to
the
performer
her
arms
dropped
to
her
sides
and
she
passed
on
it
was
little
bergmann
the
youngest
girl
in
the
school
her
playing
on
the
bad
old
piano
in
the
dark
in
the
basement
had
prepared
miriam
for
the
difference
between
the
performance
of
these
german
girls
and
nearly
all
the
she
had
heard
it
was
the
morning
after
her
arrival
she
had
been
unpacking
and
had
taken
on
the
advice
of
mademoiselle
her
heavy
boots
and
outdoor
things
down
to
the
basement
room
she
had
opened
the
door
on
emma
sitting
at
the
piano
in
her
blue
and
buff
check
stuff
dress
miriam
had
expected
her
to
turn
her
head
and
stop
playing
but
as
arms
full
she
closed
the
door
with
her
shoulders
the
child
s
profile
remained
unconcerned
she
noticed
the
head
the
thick
creamy
neck
that
seemed
bare
with
its
absence
of
and
the
soft
frill
of
tucker
stitched
right
on
to
the
dress
the
thick
cable
of
hair
reaching
just
beyond
the
rim
of
the
music
stool
the
points
of
the
little
slippers
gleaming
as
they
worked
the
pedals
the
serene
eyes
steadily
following
the
music
she
played
on
and
miriam
recognised
a
quality
she
had
only
heard
occasionally
at
concerts
and
in
the
playing
of
one
of
the
music
teachers
at
school
she
had
stood
amazed
pretending
to
be
fumbling
for
empty
pegs
as
this
child
of
fourteen
went
her
way
to
the
end
of
her
page
then
miriam
had
ventured
to
interrupt
and
to
ask
her
about
the
hanging
arrangements
and
the
child
had
risen
and
speaking
soft
south
german
had
suggested
and
poked
about
amongst
the
garments
and
shown
a
motherly
solicitude
over
the
disposal
of
miriam
s
things
miriam
noted
the
easy
range
of
the
child
s
voice
how
smoothly
it
slid
from
birdlike
queries
and
chirpings
to
the
consoling
tones
of
the
lower
register
it
seemed
to
leave
undisturbed
the
chin
and
cheeks
and
the
full
unpouting
lips
that
lay
quietly
one
upon
the
other
before
she
spoke
and
opened
flexibly
but
somehow
hardly
moved
to
her
speech
and
afterwards
closed
again
gradually
until
they
lay
softly
blossoming
as
before
emma
had
gathered
up
her
music
when
the
clothes
were
arranged
sighing
and
lamenting
gently
ware
ich
nur
zu
hause
how
happy
one
was
at
home
her
little
voice
filled
with
tears
and
her
cheeks
flushed
haypie
haypie
to
home
she
complained
as
she
slid
her
music
into
its
case
where
all
so
good
so
nice
so
beautiful
and
they
had
gone
side
by
side
up
the
dark
uncarpeted
stone
stairs
leading
from
the
basement
to
the
hall
up
emma
had
given
miriam
a
shy
firm
hug
and
then
gone
decorously
up
the
remainder
of
the
flight
the
sense
of
that
sudden
little
embrace
recurred
often
to
miriam
during
the
course
of
the
first
day
it
was
unlike
any
contact
she
had
known
more
motherly
than
her
mother
s
neither
of
her
sisters
could
have
embraced
her
like
that
she
did
not
know
that
a
human
form
could
bring
such
a
sense
of
warm
nearness
that
human
contours
could
be
eloquent
or
anyone
so
sweetly
daring
that
first
evening
at
waldstrasse
there
had
been
a
performance
that
had
completed
the
transformation
of
miriam
s
english
ideas
of
she
had
caught
the
word
vorspielen
being
bandied
about
the
long
and
had
gathered
that
there
was
to
be
an
informal
playing
of
pieces
before
fraulein
pfaff
she
welcomed
the
event
it
relieved
her
from
the
burden
of
being
in
high
focus
the
relief
had
come
as
soon
as
she
took
her
place
at
the
gaslit
table
no
eye
seemed
to
notice
her
the
english
girls
having
sat
out
two
with
her
had
ceased
the
observation
which
had
made
the
long
silence
of
the
earlier
repasts
only
less
embarrassing
than
fraulein
s
questions
about
england
the
four
germans
who
had
neither
stared
nor
even
appeared
aware
of
her
existence
talked
cheerfully
across
the
table
in
a
general
exchange
that
included
tall
fraulein
pfaff
smiling
her
miriam
provisionally
called
it
behind
the
as
chairman
the
six
girls
grouped
as
it
were
towards
their
chief
a
athletic
looking
australian
with
hot
brown
slightly
eyes
sitting
as
opposite
fraulein
joined
occasionally
in
solo
and
chorus
and
miriam
noted
with
relief
a
unanimous
atrocity
of
accent
in
their
enviable
fluency
rapid
commentary
and
wordless
located
still
more
clearly
the
english
quarter
animation
flowed
and
flowed
miriam
safely
ignored
scarcely
heeding
but
warmed
and
almost
happy
basked
she
munched
her
black
bread
and
butter
liberally
smeared
with
the
rich
savoury
paste
of
liver
sausage
and
drank
her
sweet
weak
tea
and
knew
that
she
was
very
tired
sleepy
and
tired
she
glanced
from
her
place
next
to
emma
bergmann
and
on
fraulein
s
left
hand
down
the
table
to
where
mademoiselle
sat
next
the
martins
in
similar
relation
to
the
mademoiselle
preceding
her
up
through
the
quiet
house
carrying
the
jugs
of
hot
water
had
been
her
first
impression
on
her
arrival
the
previous
night
she
had
turned
when
they
reached
the
attic
with
its
high
uncurtained
windows
and
box
beds
and
standing
on
the
one
strip
of
matting
in
her
grey
wincey
dress
with
its
neat
triple
row
of
black
ribbon
velvet
near
the
hem
had
shown
miriam
eyes
smiling
from
a
little
triangular
face
under
a
pouf
of
soft
dark
hair
and
said
voila
miriam
had
never
imagined
anything
in
the
least
like
her
she
had
said
oh
thank
you
and
taken
the
jug
and
had
hurriedly
and
silently
got
to
bed
weighed
down
by
wonders
they
had
begun
to
talk
in
the
dark
miriam
had
reaped
sweet
comfort
in
learning
that
this
seemingly
unreal
creature
who
was
she
soon
perceived
not
educated
as
she
understood
education
was
the
resident
french
governess
was
seventeen
years
old
and
a
protestant
such
close
quarters
with
a
french
girl
was
bewildering
enough
had
she
been
a
roman
catholic
miriam
felt
she
could
not
have
endured
her
proximity
she
was
evidently
a
special
kind
of
french
girl
a
protestant
from
east
france
besanon
besanon
miriam
had
tried
the
pretty
word
over
until
unexpectedly
she
had
fallen
asleep
they
had
risen
hurriedly
in
the
cold
march
gloom
and
miriam
had
not
spoken
to
her
since
there
she
sat
dainty
and
quiet
and
fresh
white
frillings
shone
now
at
the
neck
and
sleeves
of
her
little
grey
dress
she
looked
a
clean
and
clear
miniature
against
the
general
dauby
effect
of
the
english
girls
poor
though
miriam
was
sure
perhaps
as
poor
as
she
she
felt
glad
as
she
watched
her
gentle
wistfulness
that
she
would
be
upstairs
in
that
great
bare
attic
again
in
repose
her
face
looked
pinched
there
was
something
about
the
nose
and
mouth
miriam
mused
john
gilpin
s
wife
how
sleepy
she
was
the
conversation
was
growing
boisterous
she
took
courage
to
raise
her
head
towards
the
range
of
girls
opposite
to
her
those
quite
near
to
her
she
could
not
scrutinise
some
influence
coming
to
her
from
these
german
girls
prevented
her
risking
with
them
any
meeting
of
the
eyes
that
was
not
brought
about
by
direct
speech
but
she
felt
them
she
felt
emma
bergmann
s
warm
plump
presence
close
at
her
side
and
liked
to
take
food
handed
by
her
she
was
conscious
of
the
pink
bulb
of
minna
blum
s
nose
shining
just
opposite
to
her
and
of
the
way
the
light
caught
the
blond
sheen
of
her
exquisitely
coiled
hair
as
she
turned
her
always
smiling
face
and
responded
to
the
louder
remarks
with
oh
thou
god
or
is
it
possible
how
charming
or
what
in
life
dost
thou
say
rascal
next
to
her
was
the
faint
glare
of
elsa
speier
s
silent
sallowness
her
nimbus
of
pallid
hair
was
the
lowest
point
in
the
range
of
figures
across
the
table
she
darted
quick
glances
at
one
and
another
without
moving
her
head
and
miriam
felt
that
her
pale
eyes
fully
met
would
be
cunning
and
malicious
after
elsa
the
english
began
with
judy
miriam
guessed
when
she
heard
her
ask
for
brodchen
that
she
was
scotch
she
sat
slightly
askew
and
ate
eagerly
stooping
over
her
plate
with
smiling
mouth
and
downcast
face
unless
spoken
to
she
did
not
speak
but
she
laughed
often
a
harsh
involuntary
laugh
immediately
followed
by
a
drowning
flush
when
she
was
not
flushed
her
eyelashes
shone
bright
black
against
the
unstained
white
above
her
she
had
coarse
fuzzy
hair
miriam
decided
that
she
was
negligible
next
to
judy
were
the
martins
they
were
as
english
as
they
could
be
she
felt
she
must
have
noticed
them
a
good
deal
at
breakfast
and
without
knowing
it
her
eyes
after
one
glance
at
the
merino
dresses
with
hard
white
collars
and
cuffs
came
back
to
her
plate
as
from
a
familiar
picture
she
still
saw
them
sitting
very
upright
side
by
side
with
the
front
strands
of
their
hair
strained
smoothly
back
tied
just
on
the
crest
of
the
head
with
brown
ribbon
and
going
down
in
rats
to
join
the
rest
of
their
hair
which
hung
straight
and
flat
down
their
backs
the
elder
was
dark
with
thick
shoulders
and
heavy
features
her
large
expressionless
rich
brown
eyes
flashed
slowly
and
reflected
the
light
they
gave
miriam
a
slight
feeling
of
nausea
she
felt
she
knew
what
her
hands
were
like
without
looking
at
them
the
younger
was
thin
and
pale
and
slightly
she
had
pale
eyes
cold
like
a
fish
thought
miriam
they
both
had
deep
hollow
voices
when
she
glanced
again
they
were
watching
the
australian
with
their
four
strange
eyes
and
laughing
german
phrases
at
her
go
on
gertrude
are
you
gertrude
how
do
you
miriam
had
not
yet
dared
to
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
australian
her
eyes
at
had
cut
like
sharp
steel
turning
however
towards
the
danger
zone
without
risking
the
coming
of
its
presiding
genius
within
the
focus
of
her
glasses
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
jimmie
sitting
back
in
her
chair
tall
and
plump
and
neat
and
shaking
with
giggles
miriam
wondered
at
the
high
peak
of
hair
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
stared
at
her
pearly
little
teeth
there
was
something
funny
about
her
mouth
even
when
she
strained
it
wide
it
was
narrow
and
tiny
rabbity
she
raised
a
short
arm
and
began
patting
her
peak
of
hair
with
a
tiny
hand
which
showed
a
small
onyx
seal
ring
on
the
little
finger
ask
judy
she
giggled
in
a
fruity
squeak

her

tea

the
detail

stylish

and
its
shiny
black
leather
belt
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
dark
background
made
by
the
folding
doors
but
the
dreadful
outline
of
her
shoulders
was
visible
the
squarish
oval
of
her
face
shone
out
the
wide

from

the
wiry
black
hair

that
someone

though
someone
named
hermann
did
she
was
vaguely
shocked
and
interested
after
tea
the
great
doors
were
thrown
open
and
the
girls
filed
into
the
saal
it
was
a
large
high
room
furnished
like
a
enough
settees
and
easy
chairs
to
accommodate
more
than
all
the
girls
the
polished
floor
was
uncarpeted
save
for
an
archipelago
of
mats
and
rugs
in
the
wide
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
chandelier
a
grand
piano
was
pushed
against
the
wall
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
between
the
farthest
of
the
three
high
french
windows
and
the
shining
pillar
of
porcelain
stove
the
high
room
the
bright
light
the
plentiful
mirrors
the
long
sweep
of
lace
curtains
the
many
faces
the
girls
seemed
so
much
more
numerous
scattered
here
than
they
had
when
collected
in
the
schoolroom
brought
miriam
the
sense
of
the
misery
of
social
occasions
she
wondered
whether
the
girls
were
nervous
she
was
glad
that
music
lessons
were
no
part
of
her
remuneration
she
thought
of
dreadful
experiences
of
playing
before
people
the
very
first
time
at
home
when
she
had
played
a
duet
with
eve
eve
playing
a
little
running
melody
in
the
treble
her
own
part
a
page
of
minims
the
minims
had
swollen
until
she
could
not
see
whether
they
were
lines
or
spaces
and
her
fingers
had
been
so
weak
after
the
first
unexpectedly
loud
note
that
she
could
hardly
make
any
sound
eve
had
said
louder
and
her
fingers
had
suddenly
stiffened
and
she
had
worked
them
from
her
elbows
like
sticks
at
the
end
of
her
trembling
wrists
and
hands
eve
had
noticed
her
dreadful
movements
and
resented
being
elbowed
she
had
heard
nothing
then
but
her
hard
loud
minims
till
the
end
and
then
as
she
stood
dizzily
up
someone
had
said
she
had
a
nice
firm
touch
and
she
had
pushed
her
angry
way
from
the
piano
across
the
hearthrug
she
should
always
remember
the
clear
mass
of
the
fire
and
the
bottle
of
green
chartreuse
warming
on
the
blue
and
cream
tiles
there
were
probably
only
two
or
three
guests
but
the
room
had
seemed
full
of
people
stupid
people
who
had
made
her
play
how
angry
she
had
been
with
eve
for
noticing
her
discomfiture
and
with
the
forgotten
guest
for
her
silly
remark
she
knew
she
had
simply
poked
the
piano
then
there
had
been
the
annual
school
concert
all
the
girls
almost
unrecognisable
with
fear
she
had
learnt
her
pieces
by
heart
for
those
occasions
and
played
them
through
with
trembling
limbs
and
burning
eyes
alternately
thumping
with
stiff
fingers
and
feeling
her
whole
hand
faint
from
the
wrist
on
to
the
notes
which
fumbled
and
slurred
into
each
other
almost
soundlessly
until
the
thumping
began
again
at
the
musical
evenings
organised
by
eve
as
a
winter
to
the
she
had
both
played
and
sung
hoping
each
time
afresh
to
be
able
to
reproduce
the
effects
which
came
so
easily
when
she
was
alone
or
only
with
eve
but
she
could
not
discover
the
secret
of
getting
rid
of
her
nervousness
only
twice
had
she
succeeded
at
the
last
school
concert
when
she
had
been
too
miserable
to
be
nervous
and
strood
had
told
her
she
did
him
credit
and
once
she
had
sung
chanson
de
florian
in
a
way
that
had
astonished
her
own
listening
ear
the
notes
had
laughed
and
thrilled
out
into
the
air
and
come
back
to
her
from
the
wall
behind
the
piano
the
day
before
the
tennis
tournament
the
girls
were
all
settling
down
to
fancy
work
the
hands
of
the
martins
were
already
jerking
crochet
needles
faces
were
bending
over
fine
embroideries
and
minna
blum
had
trundled
a
mounted
into
the
brighter
light
miriam
went
to
the
schoolroom
and
fetched
from
her
the
piece
of
canvas
partly
covered
with
red
and
black
wool
in
diamond
pattern
that
was
her
utmost
experience
of
fancy
work
as
she
returned
she
half
saw
fraulein
pfaff
sitting
as
if
enthroned
on
a
chair
in
front
of
the
centremost
of
the
mirrors
filling
the
wall
spaces
between
the
long
french
windows
signal
to
her
to
come
to
that
side
of
the
room
timorously
ignoring
the
signal
she
got
herself
into
a
little
low
chair
in
the
shadow
of
the
swing
door
and
was
spreading
out
her
on
her
knee
when
the
vorspielen
began
emma
bergmann
was
playing
the
single
notes
of
the
opening
of
chopin
s
fifteenth
nocturne
fell
pensively
into
the
waiting
room
miriam
her
fatigue
forgotten
slid
to
a
featureless
freedom
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
light
with
which
the
room
was
filled
grew
brighter
and
clearer
she
felt
that
she
was
looking
at
nothing
and
yet
was
aware
of
the
whole
room
like
a
picture
in
a
dream
fear
left
her
the
human
forms
all
round
her
lost
their
power
they
grew
suffused
and
dim
the
pensive
swing
of
the
music
changed
to
urgency
and
emphasis
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
it
did
not
come
from
the
candlelit
corner
where
the
piano
was
it
came
from
everywhere
it
carried
her
out
of
the
house
out
of
the
world
it
hastened
with
her
on
and
on
towards
great
brightness
everything
was
growing
brighter
and
brighter
gertrude
goldring
the
australian
was
making
noises
with
her
hands
like
inflated
paper
bags
being
popped
miriam
clutched
her
and
threaded
it
she
drew
the
wool
through
her
canvas
one
three
five
three
one
and
longed
for
the
piano
to
begin
again
clara
bergmann
followed
miriam
watched
her
as
she
took
her
place
at
the
piano
how
square
and
stout
she
looked
and
old
careworn
like
a
woman
of
forty
she
had
high
square
shoulders
and
high
square
hips
brow
was
low
and
her
face
thin
and
broad
and
flat
her
eyes
were
like
the
eyes
of
a
dog
and
her
mouth
long
and
straight
until
it
went
steadily
down
at
the
corners
she
wore
a
large
fringe
like
harriett
s
and
a
thin
coil
of
hair
filled
the
nape
of
her
neck
she
played
without
music
her
face
lifted
boldly
the
notes
rang
out
in
a
prelude
of
unfinished
phrases
the
kind
miriam
noted
that
had
so
annoyed
her
father
in
what
he
called
music
she
felt
it
was
going
to
be
a
brilliant
piece
fireworks
execution
style
and
sat
up
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
clara
s
hands
can
you
see
the
hands
she
remembered
having
heard
someone
say
at
a
concert
how
easily
they
moved
clara
still
sat
back
her
face
raised
to
the
light
the
notes
rang
out
like
as
her
hands
dropped
with
an
easy
fling
and
sprang
back
and
dropped
again
what
loose
wrists
she
must
have
thought
miriam
the
clarion
notes
ceased
there
was
a
pause
clara
threw
back
her
head
a
faint
smile
flickered
over
her
face
her
hands
fell
gently
and
the
music
came
again
pianissimo
swinging
in
an
even
rhythm
it
flowed
from
those
clever
hands
a
theme
with
a
gentle
steady
throbbing
undertow
miriam
dropped
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
have
been
listening
long
that
wonderful
light
was
coming
again
she
had
forgotten
her
sewing
when
presently
she
saw
slowly
circling
fading
and
clearing
first
its
edge
and
then
for
a
moment
the
whole
thing
dripping
dripping
as
it
circled
a
she
recognised
it
instantly
she
had
seen
it
somewhere
as
a
child
in
devonshire
and
never
thought
of
it
since
and
there
it
was
she
heard
the
soft
swish
and
drip
of
the
water
and
the
low
humming
of
the
wheel
how
beautiful
it
was
fading
she
held
it
it
returned
clearer
this
time
and
she
could
feel
the
cool
breeze
it
made
and
sniff
the
fresh
earthy
scent
of
it
the
scent
of
the
moss
and
the
weeds
shining
and
dripping
on
its
huge
rim
her
heart
filled
she
felt
a
little
tremor
in
her
throat
all
at
once
she
knew
that
if
she
went
on
listening
to
that
humming
wheel
and
feeling
the
freshness
of
the
air
she
would
cry
she
pulled
herself
together
and
for
a
while
saw
only
a
vague
radiance
in
the
room
and
the
dim
forms
grouped
about
she
could
not
remember
which
was
which
all
seemed
good
and
dear
to
her
the
trumpet
notes
had
come
back
and
in
a
few
moments
the
music
ceased
someone
was
closing
the
great
doors
from
inside
the
schoolroom
as
the
side
behind
which
she
was
sitting
swung
slowly
to
she
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
crack
of
four
boys
with
heads
sitting
at
the
long
table
the
gas
was
out
and
the
room
was
dim
but
a
in
the
centre
of
the
table
cast
its
light
on
their
bowed
heads
the
playing
of
the
two
martins
brought
back
the
familiar
feeling
of
english
solomon
the
elder
one
sat
at
her
beethoven
sonata
an
adagio
movement
with
a
patch
of
dull
crimson
on
the
pallor
of
the
cheek
she
presented
to
the
room
but
she
played
with
a
heavy
fervour
preserving
throughout
the
characteristic
marching
staccato
of
the
bass
and
gave
unstinted
value
to
the
shading
of
each
phrase
she
made
miriam
feel
nervous
at
first
and
then
as
she
went
triumphantly
forward
and
let
herself
go
so
tremendously
thought
miriam
in
the
heavy
fortissimos
a
little
ashamed
of
such
expression
coming
from
english
hands
the
feeling
of
shame
lingered
as
the
younger
sister
followed
with
a
spirited
vivace
her
pallor
remained
unstained
but
her
thin
lips
were
set
and
her
hard
eyes
were
harder
she
played
with
determined
nonchalance
and
an
extraordinarily
facile
rapidity
and
miriam
s
uneasiness
changed
insensibly
to
the
conviction
that
these
girls
were
learning
in
germany
not
to
be
ashamed
of
playing
with
all
the
things
she
had
heard
strood
who
had
as
the
school
prospectus
declared
been
educated
in
leipzig
preach
and
implore
style
expression
phrasing
light
and
shade
these
girls
were
learning
picking
up
from
these
wonderful
germans
they
did
not
do
it
quite
like
them
though
they
did
not
think
only
about
the
music
they
thought
about
themselves
too
miriam
believed
she
could
do
it
as
the
germans
did
she
wanted
to
get
her
own
music
and
play
it
as
she
had
always
dimly
known
it
ought
to
be
played
and
hardly
ever
dared
perhaps
that
was
how
it
was
with
the
english
they
knew
but
they
did
not
dare
no
the
two
she
had
just
heard
playing
were
she
felt
sure
imitating
something
but
hers
would
be
no
imitation
she
would
play
as
she
wanted
to
one
day
in
this
german
atmosphere
she
wished
now
she
were
going
to
have
lessons
she
had
in
fact
had
a
lesson
but
she
wanted
to
be
alone
and
to
play
or
perhaps
with
someone
in
the
next
room
listening
perhaps
she
would
not
have
even
the
chance
of
practising
minna
rippled
through
a
chopin
valse
that
made
miriam
think
of
an
apple
orchard
in
bloom
against
a
blue
sky
and
was
followed
by
jimmie
who
played
the
spring
song
with
slightly
swaying
body
and
little
hands
that
rose
and
fell
one
against
the
other
and
reminded
miriam
of
the
finger
game
of
her
childhood
fly
away
jack
fly
away
she
played
very
sweetly
and
surely
except
that
now
and
again
it
was
as
if
the
music
caught
its
breath
jimmie
s
lied
brought
the
piano
solos
to
an
end
and
fraulein
pfaff
after
a
little
speech
of
criticism
and
general
encouragement
asked
to
miriam
s
intense
delight
for
the
singing
millie
was
called
for
millie
came
out
of
a
corner
she
was
out
of
miriam
s
range
at
and
appeared
to
her
now
for
the
first
time
as
a
tall
in
a
blue
serge
frock
plainly
made
with
long
plain
sleeves
at
the
end
of
which
appeared
two
large
hands
shining
red
and
shapeless
with
chilblains
she
attracted
miriam
at
once
with
the
and
of
her
complexion
her
firm
chubby
and
her
wide
gaze
her
face
shone
in
the
room
even
her
hair
done
just
like
the
martins
but
fluffy
where
theirs
was
flat
and
shiny
seemed
to
give
out
light
though
it
was
her
figure
was
straight
and
flat
and
she
moved
thought
miriam
as
though
she
had
no
feet
she
sang
with
careful
precision
as
to
the
accents
of
her
german
in
a
high
breathy
effortless
soprano
a
little
song
about
a
child
and
a
bouquet
of
garden
flowers
the
younger
martin
in
a
strong
hard
jolting
voice
sang
of
a
linden
tree
her
pale
thin
cheeks
herr

smiled
fraulein
at
the
end
of
this
performance
the
vorspielen
was
brought
to
an
end
by
gertrude
goldring
s
song
clara
bergmann
sat
down
to
accompany
her
and
miriam
roused
herself
for
a
double
listening
there
would
be
clara
s
opening
and
clara
s
accompaniment
and
some
wonderful
song
the
australian
stood
well
away
from
the
piano
her
shoulders
thrown
back
and
her
eyes
upon
the
wall
opposite
her
there
was
no
prelude
piano
and
voice
rang
out
together
single
notes
which
the
voice
took
and
sustained
with
an
expressive
power
which
was
beyond
anything
in
miriam
s
experience
not
a
note
was
quite
true
the
unerring
falseness
of
pitch
was
as
startling
as
the
quality
of
the
voice
the
great
wavering
shouts
slurring
now
above
now
below
the
mark
amazed
miriam
out
of
all
shyness
she
sat
up
frankly
gazing
how
dare
she
she
hasn
t
an
atom
of
ear
how
ghastly
her
thoughts
exclaimed
as
the
shouts
went
on
the
longer
sustained
notes
presently
reminded
her
of
something
it
was
like
something
she
had
heard
in
the
interval
between
the
verses
while
the
sounds
echoed
in
the
mind
she
remembered
the
cry
hand
to
mouth
of
a
london
dustman
then
she
lost
everything
in
the
story
of
the
sultan
s
daughter
and
the
young
asra
and
when
the
fullest
applause
of
the
evening
was
going
to
gertrude
s
song
she
did
not
withhold
her
share
anna
the
only
servant
miriam
had
seen
so
far
an
enormous
woman
whose
face
apart
from
the
small
eyes
seemed
all
bony
structure
miriam
noted
in
a
phrase
borrowed
from
some
unremembered
reading
brought
in
a
tray
filled
with
cups
of
milk
a
basket
of
white
rolls
and
a
pile
of
little
plates
gertrude
took
the
tray
and
handed
it
about
the
room
as
miriam
took
her
cup
chose
a
roll
deposited
it
on
a
plate
and
succeeded
in
abstracting
the
plate
from
the
pile
neatly
without
fumbling
she
felt
that
for
the
moment
gertrude
was
prepared
to
tolerate
her
she
did
not
desire
this
in
the
least
but
when
the
deep
harsh
voice
fell
against
her
from
the
bending
australian
she
responded
to
the
wie
gefallt
s
ihnen
with
an
upturned
smile
and
a
warm
sehr
gut
it
gratified
her
to
discover
that
she
could
at
the
end
of
this
one
day
understand
or
at
the
worst
gather
the
drift
of
all
she
heard
both
of
german
and
french
her
english
was
all
right
at
least
if
she
chose
pater
had
always
been
worrying
about
slang
and
careless
pronunciation
none
of
them
ever
said
cut
in
half
or
very
unique
or
ho
sale
or
she
was
awfully
slangy
herself
she
and
harriett
were
in
their
thoughts
as
well
as
their
words
but
she
had
no
provincialisms
no
londonisms
she
could
be
the
purest
oxford
english
there
was
something
at
any
rate
to
give
her
german
girls
she
could
say
there
are
no
rules
for
english
pronunciation
but
what
is
usual
at
the
university
of
oxford
is
decisive
for
cultured
people
decisive
for
cultured
she
must
remember
that
for
the
class
na
was
sticken
sie
da
miss
henderson
it
was
fraulein
pfaff
miriam
who
had
as
yet
hardly
spoken
to
her
did
not
know
whether
to
stand
or
to
remain
seated
she
half
rose
and
then
fraulein
pfaff
took
the
chair
near
her
and
miriam
sat
down
stiff
with
fear
she
could
not
remember
the
name
of
the
thing
she
was
making
she
flushed
and
fumbled
thought
of
and
the
little
objects
of
which
she
had
made
so
many
hanging
to
the
mirror
by
ribbons
haunted
her
but
that
was
not
it
she
smoothed
out
her
work
as
if
to
show
it
to
fraulein
na
na
came
the
delicate
caustic
voice
was
wird
das
wohl
sein
then
she
remembered
it
s
for
a
she
said
surely
she
need
not
venture
on
german
with
fraulein
yet
ein
nadelkissen
corrected
fraulein
das
wird
niedlich
aussehen
she
remarked
quietly
and
then
in
english
you
like
music
miss
henderson
oh
yes
said
miriam
with
a
pounce
in
her
voice
you
play
the
piano
a
you
must
keep
up
your
practice
then
while
you
are
with
us
you
must
have
time
for
fraulein
pfaff
rose
and
moved
away
the
girls
were
arranging
the
chairs
in
two
rows
plates
and
cups
were
collected
and
carried
away
it
dawned
on
miriam
that
they
were
going
to
have
prayers
what
a
on
her
evening
everything
had
been
so
bright
and
exciting
so
far
obviously
they
had
prayers
every
night
she
felt
exceedingly
uncomfortable
she
had
never
seen
prayers
in
a
it
had
been
nothing
at
school
all
the
girls
standing
in
the
rows
of
voices
saying
adsum
then
a
collect
and
the
lord
s
prayer
a
huge
bible
appeared
on
a
table
in
front
of
fraulein
s
chair
miriam
found
herself
ranged
with
the
girls
sitting
in
an
attentive
hush
there
was
a
quiet
slow
turning
of
pages
and
then
a
long
indrawn
sigh
and
fraulein
s
clear
low
even
voice
very
gentle
not
caustic
now
but
with
something
about
it
und
da
kamen
die
apostel
zu
ihm
miriam
had
a
moment
of
revolt
she
would
not
sit
there
and
let
a
woman
read
the
bible
at
her
and
in
that
smarmy
way
in
spirit
she
rose
and
marched
out
of
the
room
as
the
english
bound
to
suffer
all
things
or
go
home
she
sat
on
presently
her
ear
was
charmed
by
fraulein
s
slow
clear
enunciation
her
pure
unaspirated
north
german
it
seemed
to
suit
the
narrative
and
the
narrative
was
new
vivid
and
real
in
this
new
tongue
she
saw
presently
the
little
group
of
figures
talking
by
the
lake
and
was
sorry
when
fraulein
s
voice
ceased
solomon
martin
was
at
the
piano
someone
handed
miriam
a
shabby
little
hymnbook
she
fluttered
the
leaves
all
the
hymns
appeared
to
have
a
little
verse
under
each
ordinary
verse
in
small
print
it
was
in
english
she
read
she
fumbled
for
the
and
then
her
cheeks
flamed
with
shame
moody
and
she
was
incredulous
but
there
it
was
clearly
enough
what
was
such
a
thing
doing
here
finishing
school
for
the
daughters
of
gentlemen
she
had
never
had
such
a
thing
in
her
hands
before
fraulein
could
not
know
she
glanced
at
her
but
fraulein
s
cavernous
mouth
was
serenely
open
and
the
voices
of
the
girls
sang
heartily
whenhy
cometh
whenhy
to
his
these
girls
germany
that
piano
what
did
the
english
girls
think
had
anyone
said
anything
were
they
chapel
fearfully
she
told
them
over
no
judy
might
be
and
the
martins
perhaps
but
not
gertrude
nor
jimmie
nor
millie
how
did
it
happen
what
was
the
german
church
luther
lutheran
she
longed
for
the
end
she
glanced
through
the
book
frightful
frightful
words
and
choruses
the
girls
were
getting
on
to
their
knees
oh
dear
every
night
her
elbows
sank
into
soft
red
plush
she
was
to
have
time
for
practising
and
that
english
lesson
the
first
oxford
decisive
for
educated
people
fraulein
s
calm
voice
came
almost
in
a
whisper
vater
unser
der
du
bist
im
himmel
and
the
murmuring
voices
of
the
girls
followed
her
miriam
went
to
bed
content
wrapped
in
music
the
theme
of
carlo
s
solo
recurred
again
and
again
and
every
time
it
brought
something
of
the
wonderful
light
the
sense
of
going
forward
and
forward
through
space
she
fell
asleep
somewhere
outside
the
world
no
sooner
was
she
asleep
than
a
voice
was
saying
bonjour
meece
and
her
eyes
opened
on
daylight
and
mademoiselle
s
little
form
minuetting
towards
her
down
the
single
strip
of
matting
her
hair
hanging
in
short
ringlets
when
released
fell
forward
round
her
neck
as
she
bowed
the
slightest
dainty
inclination
from
side
to
side
against
the
swaying
of
her
dance
she
was
smiling
her
little
sprite
smile
miriam
loved
her
a
great
plaque
of
sunlight
lay
across
the
miriam
was
too
happy
to
trouble
about
her
imminent
trial
she
reflected
that
it
was
quite
possible
and
would
be
free
none
of
the
visiting
masters
came
except
sometimes
herr
bossenberger
for
that
much
she
had
learned
from
mademoiselle
and
after
all
the
class
she
had
so
dreaded
had
dwindled
to
just
these
four
girls
little
emma
and
the
three
girls
they
probably
knew
all
the
rules
and
beginnings
it
would
be
just
reading
and
so
on
it
would
not
be
so
terrible
four
sensible
girls
and
besides
they
had
accepted
her
it
did
not
seem
anything
extraordinary
to
them
that
she
should
teach
them
and
they
did
not
dislike
her
of
that
she
felt
sure
she
could
not
say
this
for
even
one
of
the
english
girls
but
the
german
girls
did
not
dislike
her
she
felt
at
ease
sitting
amongst
them
and
was
glad
she
was
there
and
not
at
the
english
end
of
the
table
down
here
hemmed
in
by
the
bergmanns
with
emma
s
little
form
her
sounds
movements
and
warmth
her
little
quiet
friendliness
planted
between
herself
and
the
english
with
the
apparently
unobservant
minna
and
elsa
across
the
way
she
felt
safe
she
felt
fairly
sure
those
german
eyes
did
not
criticise
her
perhaps
she
suggested
to
herself
they
thought
a
good
deal
of
english
people
in
general
and
then
they
were
in
the
minority
only
four
of
them
it
was
evidently
a
school
for
english
girls
as
much
as
anything
strange
what
an
adventure
for
all
those
english
girls
to
be
just
boarders
miriam
wondered
how
she
would
feel
sitting
there
as
an
english
boarder
among
the
martins
and
gertrude
millie
jimmie
and
judy
it
would
mean
being
friendly
with
them
finally
she
ensconced
herself
amongst
her
germans
feeling
additionally
secure
fraulein
had
spent
many
years
in
england
perhaps
that
explained
the
breakfast
of
oatmeal
porridge
piled
plates
of
thick
stirabout
thickly
sprinkled
with
pale
very
sweet
powdery
brown
sugar
and
the
eggs
to
follow
with
rolls
and
butter
miriam
wondered
how
fraulein
felt
towards
the
english
girls
she
wondered
whether
fraulein
liked
the
english
girls
best
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
little
spurts
of
conversation
that
came
at
intervals
as
the
table
grew
more
and
more
dismantled
she
was
there
safely
there
what
a
perfectly
stupendous
thing
weird
and
stupendous
she
told
herself
the
sunlight
poured
over
her
and
her
companions
from
the
great
windows
behind
fraulein
pfaff
when
breakfast
was
over
and
the
girls
were
clearing
the
table
fraulein
went
to
one
of
the
great
windows
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
hands
on
the
hasp
of
the
innermost
of
the
double
frames
balde
balde
miriam
heard
her
murmur
werden
wir
offnen
soon
soon
we
may
open
obviously
then
they
had
had
the
windows
shut
all
the
winter
miriam
standing
in
the
corner
near
the
companion
window
wondering
what
she
was
supposed
to
do
and
watching
the
girls
with
an
air
as
nearly
as
she
could
manage
of
indulgent
condescension
saw
without
turning
the
figure
at
the
window
gracefully
tall
with
a
curious
dignified
effect
about
the
skirt
that
swept
from
the
small
pointed
bodice
reminding
her
of
illustrations
of
heroines
of
serials
in
old
numbers
of
the
girls
own
the
dress
was
of
dark
blue
velvet
very
much
rubbed
and
faded
miriam
liked
the
effect
liked
something
about
the
clear
profile
the
sallow
hollow
cheeks
the
same
heavy
bonyness
that
anna
the
servant
had
but
finer
and
redeemed
by
the
wide
eye
that
was
so
strange
she
glanced
fearfully
at
its
unconsciousness
and
tried
to
find
words
for
the
quick
youthfulness
of
those
steady
eyes
fraulein
moved
away
into
the
little
room
opening
from
the
schoolroom
and
some
of
the
girls
joined
her
there
miriam
turned
to
the
window
she
looked
down
into
a
little
square
of
garden
it
was
gravelled
nearly
all
over
not
a
blade
of
grass
was
to
be
seen
a
narrow
little
border
of
bare
brown
mould
joined
the
gravel
to
the
high
walls
in
the
centre
was
a
little
domed
patch
of
earth
and
there
a
chestnut
tree
stood
great
bulging
buds
were
shining
whitely
from
each
twig
the
girls
seemed
to
be
gathering
in
the
room
behind
her
settling
down
round
the
table
mademoiselle
s
voice
sounded
from
the
head
of
the
table
where
fraulein
had
lately
been
it
must
be
thought
miriam
the
weekly
mending
mademoiselle
had
told
her
of
mademoiselle
was
superintending
miriam
listened
this
was
a
sort
of
french
lesson
they
all
sat
round
and
did
their
mending
together
in
french
darning
must
be
quite
different
done
like
that
she
reflected
jimmie
s
voice
came
rounded
and
giggling
oh
mademoiselle
j
ai
une
pardong
pum
de
terre
je
she
poked
three
fingers
through
the
toe
of
her
stocking
veux
dire
veux
dire
qu
vous
me
racontez
la
scolded
mademoiselle
miriam
envied
her
air
of
authority
boum
bong
came
gertrude
s
great
voice
from
the
door
rebuked
mademoiselle
how
dare
she
thought
miriam
with
a
picture
before
her
eyes
of
the
little
thing
with
the
wistful
frugal
mouth
and
nose
na
miss
henderson
it
was
fraulein
s
voice
from
within
the
little
room
minna
was
holding
the
door
open
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
dismissed
by
fraulein
with
a
smiling
recommendation
to
go
and
practise
in
the
saal
miriam
had
run
upstairs
for
her
music
it
s
all
right
i
m
all
right
i
shall
be
able
to
do
it
she
said
to
herself
as
she
ran
the
ordeal
was
past
she
was
she
had
learned
to
talk
english
with
the
german
girls
at
table
during
walks
whenever
she
found
herself
with
them
excepting
on
saturdays
and
sundays
and
she
was
to
read
with
the
four
for
an
hour
three
times
a
week
there
had
been
no
mention
of
grammar
or
study
in
any
sense
she
understood
she
had
had
a
moment
of
tremor
when
fraulein
had
said
in
her
slow
clear
english
i
leave
you
to
your
pupils
miss
henderson
and
with
that
had
gone
out
and
shut
the
door
the
moment
she
had
dreaded
had
come
this
was
germany
there
was
no
escape
her
desperate
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
volume
on
the
table
bound
in
brilliant
blue
cloth
she
got
it
into
her
shaking
hands
it
was
she
felt
she
could
have
shouted
in
her
relief
a
treatise
on
the
morse
code
would
not
have
surprised
her
she
had
heard
that
such
things
were
studied
at
school
abroad
and
that
german
children
knew
the
names
and
worse
than
that
the
meaning
of
the
names
of
the
streets
in
the
city
of
london
but
this
book
that
she
and
harriett
had
banished
and
wanted
to
burn
in
their
early
teens
together
with
sandford
and
you
are
reading
misunderstood
she
faltered
glancing
at
the
four
politely
waiting
girls
it
was
minna
who
answered
her
in
her
husky
eager
voice
d
ja
d
ja
she
responded
na
ich
meine
we
read
so
sweet
and
beautiful
book
not
oh
said
miriam
yes
and
then
eagerly
you
all
like
it
do
you
clara
and
elsa
agreed
unenthusiastically
emma
at
her
elbow
made
a
little
despairing
gesture
i
can
t
english
she
moaned
gently
too
miriam
tested
their
reading
the
class
had
begun
nothing
had
happened
it
was
all
right
they
each
dutifully
and
with
extreme
carefulness
read
a
short
passage
miriam
sat
blissfully
back
it
was
incredible
the
class
was
going
on
the
chestnut
tree
budded
approval
from
the
garden
she
gravely
corrected
their
accents
the
girls
were
respectful
they
appeared
to
be
interested
they
vied
with
each
other
to
get
exact
sounds
and
they
presently
delighted
miriam
by
telling
her
they
could
understand
her
english
much
better
than
that
of
her
predecessor
so
cleare
so
cleare
they
chimed
and
then
they
all
five
seemed
to
be
talking
at
once
the
little
room
was
full
of
broken
english
of
miriam
s
interpolated
corrections
it
was
going
succeeding
this
was
her
class
she
hoped
fraulein
was
listening
outside
she
probably
was
heads
of
foreign
schools
did
she
remembered
madame
beck
in
but
if
she
was
not
she
hoped
they
would
tell
her
about
being
able
to
understand
the
new
english
teacher
so
well
oh
i
am
haypie
emma
was
saying
with
adoring
eyes
on
miriam
and
her
two
arms
outflung
on
the
table
miriam
recoiled
this
would
not
do
they
must
not
all
talk
at
once
and
go
on
like
this
minna
s
whole
face
was
aflame
she
sat
up
stiffly
adjusted
her
and
desperately
ordered
the
reading
to
begin
again
at
minna
they
all
subsided
and
minna
s
careful
face
the
others
sat
back
and
attended
miriam
watched
minna
judicially
and
hoped
she
looked
like
a
teacher
she
knew
her
disguised
her
and
none
of
these
girls
knew
she
was
only
seventeen
and
a
half
sorrowg
minna
was
saying
hesitating
miriam
had
not
heard
the
preceding
word
once
more
the
whole
sentence
she
said
with
quiet
gravity
and
then
as
minna
reached
the
word
thorough
she
corrected
and
spent
five
minutes
showing
her
how
to
get
over
the
redoubtable
they
all
experimented
and
exclaimed
they
had
never
been
shown
that
it
was
just
a
matter
of
getting
the
tongue
between
the
teeth
miriam
herself
had
only
just
discovered
it
she
speculated
as
to
how
long
it
would
take
her
to
deliver
them
up
to
fraulein
pfaff
with
this
notorious
removed
she
was
astonished
herself
at
the
mechanical
simplicity
of
the
cure
how
stupid
people
must
be
not
to
discover
these
things
minna
s
voice
went
on
she
would
let
her
read
a
page
she
began
to
wonder
rather
blankly
what
she
was
to
do
to
fill
up
the
hour
after
they
had
all
read
a
page
she
had
just
reached
the
conclusion
that
they
must
do
some
sort
of
writing
when
fraulein
pfaff
came
and
still
affable
and
smiling
had
ushered
the
girls
to
their
mending
and
sent
miriam
off
to
the
saal
as
she
flew
upstairs
for
her
music
saying
i
m
all
right
i
can
do
it
all
right
she
was
that
her
provisional
success
with
her
class
had
very
little
to
do
with
her
bounding
joy
that
success
had
not
so
much
given
her
anything
to
be
glad
about
it
had
rather
removed
an
obstacle
of
gladness
which
was
waiting
to
break
forth
she
was
going
to
stay
on
that
was
the
point
she
would
stay
in
this
wonderful
she
came
singing
down
through
the
quiet
house
the
sunlight
poured
from
bedroom
windows
through
open
doors
she
reached
the
quiet
saal
here
stood
the
great
piano
its
keyboard
open
under
the
light
of
the
french
window
opposite
the
door
through
which
she
came
behind
the
great
closed
swing
doors
the
girls
were
talking
over
their
raccommodage
miriam
paid
not
even
need
to
try
to
ignore
them
she
felt
strong
and
independent
she
would
play
to
herself
she
would
play
something
she
knew
perfectly
a
grieg
lyric
or
a
movement
from
a
beethoven
sonata
on
this
gorgeous
piano
and
let
herself
go
and
listen
that
was
music
not
playing
things
but
listening
to
beethoven
it
must
be
beethoven
grieg
was
different
acquired
like
those
strange
green
figs
pater
had
brought
from
tarring
beethoven
had
always
been
real
it
was
all
growing
clearer
and
clearer
she
chose
the
first
part
of
the
first
movement
of
the
sonata
pathetique
that
she
knew
she
could
play
faultlessly
it
was
the
last
thing
she
had
learned
and
she
had
never
grown
weary
of
practising
slowly
through
its
long
bars
of
chords
she
had
played
it
at
her
last
dear
old
stroodie
walking
up
and
down
the
long
steady
the
bass
grip
the
chords
then
standing
at
her
side
and
saying
in
the
thin
light
sneery
part
of
his
voice
you
can
you
ve
got
hands
like
umbrellas
and
showing
her
how
easily
she
could
stretch
two
notes
beyond
his
own
span
and
then
marching
away
as
she
played
and
crying
out
to
her
standing
under
the
high
windows
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
let
it
go
let
it
go
and
she
had
almost
forgotten
her
wretched
self
almost
heard
the
music
she
felt
for
the
pedals
lifted
her
hands
a
span
above
the
piano
as
clara
had
done
and
came
down
true
and
clean
on
to
the
opening
chord
the
full
rich
tones
of
the
piano
echoed
from
all
over
the
room
and
some
metal
object
far
away
from
her
hummed
the
dominant
she
held
the
chord
for
its
full
term
should
she
play
any
more
she
had
confessed
herself
just
that
minor
chord
anyone
hearing
it
would
know
more
than
she
could
ever
tell
them
her
whole
being
beat
out
the
rhythm
as
she
waited
for
the
end
of
the
phrase
to
insist
on
what
already
had
been
said
as
it
came
she
found
herself
sitting
back
slackening
the
muscles
of
her
arms
and
of
her
whole
body
and
ready
to
swing
forward
into
the
rising
storm
of
her
page
she
did
not
need
to
follow
the
notes
on
the
music
stand
her
fingers
knew
them
grave
and
happy
she
sat
with
unseeing
eyes
listening
for
the
first
time
at
the
end
of
the
page
she
was
sitting
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
aware
of
fraulein
standing
between
the
open
swing
doors
with
gertrude
s
face
showing
over
her
shoulder
its
amazement
changing
to
a
smile
as
fraulein
s
quietly
repeated
prachtvoll
prachtvoll
came
across
the
room
miriam
after
a
hasty
smile
sat
straining
her
eyes
as
widely
as
possible
so
that
the
tears
should
not
fall
she
glared
at
the
volume
in
front
of
her
turning
the
pages
she
was
glad
that
the
heavy
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
the
room
she
blinked
she
thought
they
would
not
notice
only
one
tear
fell
and
that
was
from
the
left
eye
towards
the
wall
you
are
a
real
musician
miss
henderson
said
fraulein
advancing
every
other
day
or
so
miriam
found
she
could
get
an
hour
on
a
bedroom
piano
and
always
on
a
saturday
morning
during
she
rediscovered
all
the
pieces
she
had
already
learned
she
went
through
them
one
by
one
eagerly
slurring
over
difficulties
pressing
on
getting
their
effect
listening
and
discovering
it
s
i
want
she
told
herself
when
she
had
reached
the
end
of
her
collection
beginning
to
attach
a
meaning
to
the
familiar
word
then
she
set
to
work
she
restricted
herself
to
the
pathetique
always
omitting
the
first
page
which
she
knew
so
well
and
practised
mechanically
slowly
meaninglessly
with
neither
pedalling
nor
expression
page
by
page
until
a
movement
was
perfect
then
when
the
mood
came
she
played
and
listened
she
soon
discovered
she
could
not
always
play
even
the
things
she
knew
perfectly
and
she
began
to
understand
the
fury
that
had
seized
her
when
her
mother
and
a
woman
here
and
there
had
taken
for
granted
one
should
play
when
asked
and
coldly
treated
her
refusal
as
showing
lack
of
courtesy
ah
she
said
aloud
as
this
realisation
came
of
course
you
can
only
play
when
you
said
she
to
herself
like
a
bird
she
sang
once
or
twice
very
quietly
in
those
early
weeks
but
she
gave
that
up
she
had
a
whole
sheaf
of
songs
with
her
but
after
that
first
vorspielen
they
seemed
to
have
lost
their
meaning
one
by
one
she
looked
them
through
her
dear
old
venetian
song
beauty
s
eyes
an
old
garden
she
hesitated
over
that
and
hummed
it
through
best
of
all
in
old
madrid
the
vocal
score
of
the
mikado
her
little
chanson
de
florian
and
a
score
of
others
she
blushed
at
her
collection
the
chanson
de
florian
might
perhaps
hold
its
own
at
a
vorspielen
sung
by
bertha
martin
perhaps
the
remainder
of
her
songs
excepting
a
little
bound
volume
of
sterndale
bennett
she
put
away
at
the
bottom
of
her
saratoga
trunk
meanwhile
there
were
songs
being
learned
by
herr
bossenberger
s
pupils
for
which
she
listened
hungrily
schubert
grieg
brahms
she
would
always
during
those
early
weeks
sacrifice
her
practising
to
listen
from
the
schoolroom
to
a
pupil
singing
in
the
saal
the
morning
of
ulrica
hesse
s
arrival
was
one
of
the
mornings
when
she
could
she
was
sitting
happy
in
the
large
english
bedroom
listening
it
was
late
she
was
beginning
to
wonder
why
the
gonging
did
not
come
when
the
door
opened
it
was
millie
in
her
with
her
hair
loose
and
a
towel
over
her
arm
oh
bitte
miss
henderson
will
you
please
go
down
to
frau
krause
fraulein
pfaff
says
she
said
her
baby
face
full
of
responsibility
miriam
rose
uneasily
what
might
this
be
frau
krause
she
asked
oh
yes
it
s
haarwaschen
said
millie
anxiously
evidently
determined
to
wait
until
miriam
recognised
her
duty
where
said
miriam
aghast
oh
in
the
basement
i
go
frau
krause
s
waiting
will
you
come
oh
well
i
suppose
so
mumbled
miriam
coming
to
the
door
as
the
child
turned
to
go
all
right
said
millie
i
m
going
down
do
make
haste
miss
henderson
will
you
all
right
said
miriam
going
back
into
the
room
collecting
her
music
she
went
incredulously
upstairs
this
was
school
with
a
vengeance
this
was
it
was
abominable
fraulein
pfaff
indeed
ordering
her
miriam
to
go
downstairs
and
have
her
hair
washed
by
frau
krause
without
any
warning
someone
should
have
told
her
and
let
her
choose
her
hair
was
clean
sarah
had
always
done
it
miriam
s
throat
contracted
she
would
not
go
down
frau
krause
should
not
touch
her
she
reached
the
attics
their
door
was
open
and
there
was
mademoiselle
in
her
little
alpaca
towelling
her
head
her
face
came
up
flushed
and
gay
miriam
was
too
angry
to
note
till
afterwards
how
pretty
she
had
looked
with
her
hair
like
that
ah
c
est
le
grand
lavage
sang
mademoiselle
oui
said
miriam
surlily
what
could
she
do
she
imagined
the
whole
school
waiting
downstairs
to
see
her
come
down
to
be
done
should
she
go
down
and
decline
explain
to
fraulein
pfaff
she
hated
her
vindictively
her
calm
message
treating
me
like
a
she
saw
the
horse
smile
and
heard
the
caustic
voice
it
s
sickening
she
muttered
whisking
her
from
its
nail
and
seizing
a
towel
mademoiselle
was
piling
up
her
damp
hair
before
the
little
mirror
slowly
miriam
made
her
journey
to
the
basement
minna
and
elsa
were
brushing
out
their
long
hair
with
their
door
open
a
strong
sweet
perfume
came
from
the
room
the
basement
hall
was
dark
save
for
the
patch
of
light
coming
from
the
open
kitchen
door
in
the
patch
stood
a
low
table
and
a
kitchen
chair
on
the
table
which
was
shining
wet
and
smeary
with
soap
stood
a
huge
basin
out
over
the
basin
flew
a
long
tail
of
hair
and
miriam
s
anxious
eyes
found
millie
standing
in
the
further
gloom
twisting
and
wringing
no
one
else
was
to
be
seen
perhaps
it
was
all
over
she
was
too
late
then
a
second
basin
held
in
coarse
red
hands
appeared
round
the
kitchen
door
and
in
a
moment
a
woman
large
and
coarse
with
the
sleeves
of
her
blue
and
white
cotton
dress
rolled
back
and
a
great
teapot
of
pale
nasturtium
coloured
hair
shining
above
the
third
of
miriam
s
bony
german
faces
had
emerged
and
plumped
her
steaming
basin
down
upon
the
table
soap
and
horrid
pudding
basins
of
steaming
water
miriam
s
hair
had
never
been
washed
with
anything
but
cantharides
and
on
a
tiny
special
sponge
in
full
horror
oh
she
said
in
a
low
vague
voice
it
doesn
t
matter
about
gun
tak
fr
n
snapped
the
woman
briskly
miriam
gave
herself
up
gooten
mawgen
frau
krause
said
millie
s
polite
departing
voice
miriam
s
outraged
head
hung
over
the
steaming
basin
her
hair
spread
round
it
like
a
tent
frilling
out
over
the
table
for
a
moment
she
thought
that
the
nausea
which
had
seized
her
as
she
surrendered
would
the
next
instant
make
flight
imperative
then
her
amazed
ears
caught
the
sharp
bump
crack
of
an
eggshell
against
the
rim
of
the
basin
followed
by
a
further
brisk
crackling
just
above
her
she
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
as
the
egg
descended
with
a
cold
slither
upon
her
incredulous
skull
tears
came
to
her
eyes
as
she
gave
beneath
the
onslaught
of
two
hugely
enveloping
vigorously
drubbing
hands
sh
ham
poo
gasped
her
mind
the
drubbing
went
relentlessly
on
miriam
steadied
her
head
against
it
and
gradually
warmth
and
ease
began
to
return
to
her
shivering
clenched
body
her
hair
was
gathered
into
the
steaming
basin
dipped
and
rinsed
and
spread
a
comforting
compress
warm
with
the
water
over
her
head
there
was
more
drubbing
more
dipping
and
rinsing
the
second
basin
was
from
the
kitchen
and
after
a
final
rinse
in
its
fresh
warm
water
miriam
found
herself
standing
up
with
a
twisted
tail
of
wet
hair
hanging
down
over
her
cape
of
damp
towel
glowing
and
hungry
thank
you
she
said
timidly
to
frau
krause
s
bustling
presence
gun
tak
fr
n
said
frau
krause
disappearing
into
the
kitchen
miriam
gave
her
hair
a
preliminary
drying
gathered
her
together
and
went
upstairs
from
the
schoolroom
came
unmistakable
sounds
they
were
evidently
at
dinner
she
hurried
to
her
attic
what
she
to
do
with
her
hair
she
rubbed
it
desperately
fancy
being
landed
with
hair
like
that
in
the
middle
of
the
day
she
could
not
possibly
go
down
she
must
fraulein
pfaff
would
expect
her
to
and
would
be
disgusted
if
she
were
not
quick
she
towelled
frantically
at
the
short
strands
round
her
forehead
despairingly
screwed
them
into
hinde
s
and
towelled
at
the
rest
what
had
the
other
girls
done
if
only
she
could
look
into
the
schoolroom
before
going
down
it
was
awful
what
should
she
do
she
caught
sight
of
a
brush
on
mademoiselle
s
bed
mademoiselle
had
put
hers
up
she
had
seen
her
of
course
easy
enough
for
her
little
fluffy
clouds
she
could
do
nothing
with
her
straight
wet
lumps
she
began
to
brush
it
out
it
separated
into
thin
tails
which
flipped
tiny
drops
of
moisture
against
her
hands
as
she
brushed
her
arms
ached
her
face
flared
with
her
exertions
she
was
ravenous
she
must
manage
somehow
and
go
down
she
braided
the
long
strands
and
fastened
their
cold
mass
with
extra
hairpins
then
she
unfastened
the
hinde
s
two
tendrils
flopped
limply
against
her
forehead
she
combed
them
out
they
fell
in
a
curtain
of
streaks
to
her
nose
feverishly
she
divided
them
draped
them
somehow
back
into
the
rest
of
her
hair
and
fastened
them
oh
she
breathed
my
it
was
all
she
could
do
short
of
gas
and
curling
tongs
even
the
candle
was
taken
away
in
the
daytime
it
was
cold
and
bleak
upstairs
her
wet
hair
lay
in
a
heavy
mass
against
her
burning
head
she
was
painfully
hungry
she
went
down
the
snarling
rattle
of
the
coffee
mill
sounded
out
into
the
hall
several
voices
were
speaking
together
as
she
entered
fraulein
pfaff
was
not
there
gertrude
goldring
was
grinding
the
coffee
the
girls
were
sitting
round
the
table
in
easy
attitudes
and
had
the
effect
of
holding
a
council
emma
her
elbows
on
the
table
her
little
face
bunched
with
scorn
put
out
a
motherly
arm
and
set
a
chair
for
miriam
jimmie
had
flung
some
friendly
remark
as
she
came
in
miriam
did
not
hear
what
she
said
but
smiled
responsively
she
wanted
to
get
quietly
to
her
place
and
look
round
there
was
evidently
something
in
the
air
they
all
seemed
preoccupied
perhaps
no
one
would
notice
how
awful
she
looked
you
re
not
the
only
one
my
dear
she
said
to
herself
in
her
mother
s
voice
no
she
replied
in
person
but
no
one
will
be
looking
so
perfectly
frightful
as
i
say
do
they
know
you
re
down
said
gertrude
hospitably
as
the
boiling
water
snored
on
to
the
coffee
emma
rushed
to
the
lift
and
rattled
the
panel
anna
she
ordered
meece
hendshon
suppe
oh
thanks
said
miriam
in
general
she
could
not
meet
anyone
s
eye
the
coffee
cups
were
being
slid
up
to
gertrude
s
end
of
the
table
and
rapidly
filled
by
her
gertrude
of
course
she
noticed
had
contrived
to
look
dashing
and
smart
her
hair
with
the
exception
of
some
wild
ends
that
hung
round
her
face
was
screwed
loosely
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
transfixed
with
a
hair
ornament
like
a
japanese
indian
no
maori
that
was
it
she
looked
like
a
new
zealander
clara
and
minna
had
fastened
up
theirs
with
combs
and
ribbons
and
looked
decent
frauish
though
thought
miriam
judy
wore
a
plait
without
her
fuzzy
cloud
she
looked
exactly
like
a
country
servant
a
farmhouse
servant
she
drank
her
coffee
noisily
and
furtively
she
looked
extraordinary
thought
miriam
and
took
comfort
the
martins
brown
bows
appeared
on
their
necks
instead
of
cresting
their
improved
them
miriam
thought
what
regular
features
they
had
bertha
looked
like
a
youth
like
a
musician
her
hair
was
loosened
a
little
at
the
sides
shading
the
corners
of
her
forehead
and
adding
to
its
height
it
shone
like
marble
high
and
straight
emma
s
hair
hung
round
her
like
a
shawl
lisbeth
gretchen
what
was
that
lovely
german
name
hild
brunhilde
talk
had
begun
again
miriam
hoped
they
had
not
noticed

said
jimmie
judicially
sitting
forward
with
her
plump
hands
clasped
on
the
table
her
pinnacle
of
hair
looked
exactly
as
usual
oh
miriam
tried
to
make
a
picture
of
a
classic
knot
in
her
mind
if
one
have
classic
head
one
can
have
classic
knot
scolded
clara
who

how
they
hated

the

at

fancy
calling
her
lily
miriam
did
not
like
it
she
had
known
at
once
none
of
the
teachers
at
school
had
been
called
by
their
christian
names
there
had
been
old

the
elfkin
and
dear
donnikin

and
good
old
kingie
and
all
of
them
but
no

oh

so
there
had
sally
but
then
sally
was
couldn
t
have
been
anything
else
never
could
have
held
a
position
of
any
sort
they
ought
not
to
call
fraulein
pfaff
that
it
was
somehow
nasty
did
the
english
girls
do
it
ought
she
to
have
said
anything
mademoiselle
did
not
seem
at
all
shocked
where
was
fraulein
pfaff
all
this
time
perhaps
somewhere
hidden
away
in
her
rooms
being
done
by
frau
krause
fancy
telling
them
all
to
alter
the
way
they
did
their
hair
everyone
was
writing
saturday
letters
mademoiselle
and
the
germans
with
compressed
lips
and
fine
careful
evenly
moving
the
english
scrawling
and
scraping
and
dashing
their
pens
at
all
angles
and
careless
eager
faces
an
almost
unbroken
silence
seemed
the
order
of
the
earlier
part
of
a
saturday
afternoon
the
room
was
very
still
save
for
the
slight
movements
of
the
writers
at
intervals
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
little
chorus
of
pens
clara
still
smouldering
sitting
at
the
window
end
of
the
room
looked
now
and
again
gloomily
out
into
the
garden
miriam
did
not
want
to
write
letters
she
sat
pen
in
hand
and
in
front
of
her
feeling
that
she
loved
the
atmosphere
of
these
saturday
afternoons
this
was
her
second
she
had
been
in
the
school
a
fortnight
the
first
saturday
she
had
spent
writing
to
her
mother
a
long
letter
for
everyone
to
read
full
of
first
impressions
and
enclosing
a
slangy
almost
affectionate
little
note
for
harriett
in
her
general
letter
she
had
said
if
you
want
to
think
of
something
jolly
think
of
me
she
had
hesitated
over
that
sentence
when
she
considered
especially
the
midday
meal
but
on
the
whole
she
had
decided
to
let
it
stand
this
afternoon
she
felt
it
was
truer
she
was
beginning
to
belong
to
the
house
she
did
not
want
to
write
letters
but
just
to
sit
revelling
in
the
sense
of
this
room
full
of
quietly
occupied
girls
in
the
first
hours
of
the
weekly
holiday
she
thought
of
strange
ulrica
somewhere
upstairs
and
felt
quite
one
of
the
old
gang
ages
she
had
known
all
these
girls
she
was
not
afraid
of
them
at
all
she
would
not
be
afraid
of
them
any
more
emma
bergmann
across
the
table
raised
a
careworn
face
from
her
two
lines
of
large
neat
lettering
and
caught
her
eye
she
put
up
her
hands
on
either
side
of
her
mouth
as
if
for
shouting
she
articulated
silently
in
her
curious
lipless
way
mein
liebes
liebes
miriam
smiled
timidly
and
sternly
began
fumbling
at
her
week
s
letters
one
from
eve
full
of
congratulations
and
recommendations
keep
up
your
music
my
dear
said
the
conclusion
and
don
t
mind
that
little
german
girl
being
fond
of
you
it
is
impossible
to
be
too
fond
of
people
if
you
keep
it
all
on
a
high
level
and
a
scrawl
from
harriett
pure
slang
from
beginning
to
end
both
these
letters
and
an
earlier
one
from
her
mother
had
moved
her
to
tears
and
longing
when
they
came
she
them
now
unmoved
and
felt
aloof
from
the
things
they
suggested
it
did
not
seem
imperative
to
respond
to
them
at
once
she
folded
them
together
if
only
she
could
bring
them
all
for
a
minute
into
this
room
the
wonderful
germany
that
she
had
achieved
if
they
could
even
come
to
the
door
and
look
in
she
did
not
in
the
least
want
to
go
back
she
wanted
them
to
come
to
her
and
taste
germany
to
see
all
that
went
on
in
this
wonderful
house
to
see
pretty
german
emma
adoring
her
to
hear
the
music
that
was
everywhere
all
the
week
that
went
like
a
garland
in
and
out
of
everything
to
hear
her
play
by
accident
and
acknowledge
the
difference
in
her
playing
oh
yes
besides
seeing
them
all
she
wanted
them
to
hear
her
play
she
must
stay
she
glanced
round
the
room
it
was
here
somehow
somewhere
in
this
roomful
of
girls
centring
in
the
germans
at
her
end
of
the
table
reflected
on
to
the
english
group
something
of
that
influence
that
had
made
her
play
it
was
in
the
sheen
on
minna
s
hair
in
emma
s
schoolgirlishness
somehow
in
clara
s
anger
it
was
here
here
and
she
was
in
it
she
must
pretend
to
be
writing
letters
or
someone
might
speak
to
her
she
would
hate
anyone
who
challenged
her
at
this
moment
jimmie
might
it
was
just
the
kind
of
thing
jimmie
would
do
her
eyes
were
always
roving
round
there
were
a
lot
of
people
like
that
it
was
all
right
when
you
wanted
anything
or
to
to
create
a
diversion
when
everybody
was
quarrelling
but
at
the
wrong
times
it
was
awful
the
radnors
and
pooles
were
like
that
she
could
have
killed
them
often
hullo
mim
they
would
say
wake
up
or
what
s
the
row
and
if
you
asked
why
they
would
laugh
and
tell
you
you
looked
like
a
dying
duck
in
a
thunderstorm
it
was
all
right
no
one
had
noticed
her
or
if
either
of
the
germans
had
they
would
not
think
like
that
they
would
understand
she
believed
in
a
way
they
would
understand
at
the
worst
they
would
look
at
you
as
if
they
were
somehow
with
you
and
say
something
sentimental
sie
hat
heimweh
or
something
like
that
minna
would
minna
s
blue
eyes
behind
her
pink
nose
would
be
quite
real
and
alive
ein
blatt
she
dipped
her
pen
and
wrote
ein
blatt
aus
ein
blatt
aus
sommerlichen
tagen
that
thing
they
had
begun
last
saturday
afternoon
and
gone
on
and
on
with
until
she
had
hated
the
sound
of
the
words
how
did
it
go
on
ein
blatt
aus
sommerlichen
tagen
she
breathed
in
a
half
whisper
minna
heard
and
without
looking
up
from
her
writing
quietly
repeated
the
verse
her
voice
rose
and
trembled
slightly
on
the
last
line
oh
chuck
it
minna
groaned
bertha
martin
tchookitt
repeated
minna
absently
and
went
on
with
her
writing
miriam
was
scribbling
down
the
words
as
quickly
as
she
could
ein

ich
nahm
es
so
im
wandern
mit

es
einst
mir

she
was
not
sure
it
was
perfectly
lovely
she
read
it
through
translating
stumblingly
a
leaf
from
summery
days
i
took
it
with
me
on
my
way
so
that
it
might
remind
me
how
loud
the
nightingale
had
sung
how
green
the
wood
i
had
passed
with
a
pang
she
felt
it
was
true
that
summer
ended
in
dead
leaves
but
she
had
no
leaf
nothing
to
remind
her
of
her
summer
days
they
were
all
past
and
she
had
nothing
not
the
smallest
thing
the
two
little
bunches
of
flowers
she
had
put
away
in
her
desk
had
all
crumbled
together
and
she
could
not
tell
which
was
which
there
was
nothing
else
but
the
things
she
had
told
eve
and
perhaps
eve
had
forgotten
there
was
nothing
there
were
the
names
in
her
birthday
book
she
had
forgotten
them
she
would
look
at
them
she
flushed
she
would
look
at
them
sometime
when
mademoiselle
was
not
there
the
room
was
waking
up
from
its
people
were
moving
about
she
would
not
write
it
was
not
worth
while
beginning
she
took
a
fresh
sheet
of
and
copied
her
verse
spacing
it
carefully
with
a
wide
margin
all
round
so
that
it
came
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
page
it
would
soon
be
wie
grun
der
she
remembered
one
wood
the
only
one
she
could
remember
there
were
no
woods
at
barnes
or
at
the
seaside
only
that
wood
at
the
very
beginning
someone
carrying
harriett
and
green
green
the
brightest
she
had
ever
seen
and
anemones
everywhere
she
could
see
them
distinctly
at
this
moment
she
wanted
to
put
her
face
down
into
the
green
among
the
anemones
she
could
not
remember
how
she
got
there
or
the
going
home
but
just
standing
there
the
green
and
the
flowers
and
something
in
her
ear
buzzing
and
frightening
her
and
making
her
cry
and
somebody
poking
a
large
finger
into
the
buzzing
ear
and
making
it
very
hot
and
sore
the
afternoon
sitting
had
broken
up
the
table
was
empty
emma
in
raptures
near
the
window
was
calling
to
the
other
germans
minna
came
and
chirruped
too
there
was
a
sound
of
dull
scratching
on
the
window
then
a
little
burst
of
admiration
from
emma
and
minna
together
miriam
looked
round
in
emma
s
hand
shone
a
small
antique
watch
encrusted
with
jewels
at
her
side
was
the
new
girl
miriam
saw
a
filmy
black
dress
and
above
it
a
pallid
face
what
was
it
like
it
was
like
like
like
jasmine
that
was
it
jasmine
and
out
of
the
jasmine
face
the
great
gaze
she
had
met
in
the
morning
turned
upon
the
growing
group
of
girls
examining
the
watch
chapter
iv
miriam
paid
her
first
visit
to
a
german
church
the
next
day
her
third
sunday
of
the
first
sunday
now
so
far
off
she
could
remember
nothing
but
sitting
in
a
chair
in
the
saal
trying
to
read
les
travailleurs
de
la
mer
seas
and
a
sunburnt
youth
striding
down
a
desolate
lane
in
a
storm
and
the
beginning
of
they
had
been
kept
indoors
all
day
by
the
rain
the
second
sunday
they
had
all
gone
in
the
evening
to
the
english
church
with
fraulein
pfaff
chairs
with
a
ledge
for
books
placed
very
close
together
and
scrooping
on
the
stone
floor
with
the
movements
of
the
congregation
a
little
gathering
of
english
people
they
seemed
very
dear
for
a
moment
what
was
it
about
them
that
was
so
attractive
that
gave
them
their
air
of
refinement
then
as
she
watched
their
faces
as
they
sang
she
felt
that
she
knew
all
these
women
the
way
with
little
personal
differences
they
would
talk
the
way
they
would
smile
and
take
things
for
granted
and
the
men
standing
there
in
their
overcoats
why
were
they
there
what
were
they
doing
what
were
their
thoughts
she
pressed
as
against
a
barrier
nothing
came
to
her
from
these
unconscious
forms
they
seemed
so
untroubled
probably
they
were
all
conservatives
that
was
part
of
their
they
would
all
disapprove
of
gladstone
get
up
into
the
pulpit
and
say
gladstone
very
loud
and
watch
the
result
gladstone
was
a
radical
pull
everything
up
by
the
pater
was
always
angry
and
sneery
about
him
where
were
the
radicals
somewhere
very
far
away
the
conservatives
made
them
thump
tubs
no
wonder
she
decided
she
must
be
a
radical
certainly
she
did
not
belong
to
these
refined
english
women
or
men
she
was
quite
sure
of
that
seeing
them
gathered
together
english
in
this
foreign
town
but
then
radicals
were
probably
chapel
it
would
be
best
to
stay
with
the
germans
yes
she
would
stay
there
was
a
woman
sitting
in
the
endmost
chair
just
across
the
aisle
in
line
with
them
she
had
a
pale
face
and
looked
worn
and
the
effect
of
refinement
made
on
miriam
by
the
congregation
seemed
to
radiate
from
her
there
was
a
large
ostrich
feather
fastened
by
a
gleaming
buckle
against
the
side
of
her
silky
beaver
hat
it
swept
miriam
found
the
word
during
the
psalms
back
over
her
hair
miriam
glancing
at
her
again
and
again
felt
that
she
would
like
to
be
near
her
watch
her
and
touch
her
and
find
out
the
secret
of
her
effect
but
not
talk
to
her
never
talk
to
her
she
too
sad
and
alone
though
miriam
knew
her
to
be
would
have
her
way
of
smiling
and
taking
things
for
granted
the
sermon
came
miriam
sat
chafing
through
it
one
angry
glance
towards
the
pulpit
had
shown
her
a
pale
face
she
checked
her
thoughts
she
felt
they
would
be
too
savage
would
rend
her
unendurably
she
tried
not
to
listen
she
felt
the
preacher
was
dealing
out
pastoral
she
tried
to
give
her
mind
elsewhere
but
the
sound
of
the
voice
unconvinced
and
unconvincing
threatened
her
again
and
again
with
a
tide
of
furious
resentment
she
fidgeted
and
felt
for
thoughts
and
tried
to
compose
her
face
to
a
semblance
of
serenity
it
would
not
do
to
sit
scowling
here
amongst
her
pupils
with
fraulein
pfaff
s
eye
commanding
her
profile
from
the
end
of
the
pew
just
behind
the
air
was
gassy
and
close
her
feet
were
cold
the
gentle
figure
across
the
aisle
was
sitting
very
still
with
folded
hands
and
grave
eyes
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
pulpit
of
course
miriam
had
known
it
she
would
think
over
the
sermon
afterwards
the
voice
in
the
pulpit
had
dropped
miriam
glanced
up
the
figure
faced
about
and
intoned
rapidly
the
congregation
rose
for
a
moment
rustling
and
rustling
subsided
again
a
hymn
was
given
out
they
rose
again
and
sang
it
was
lead
kindly
chilly
and
feverish
and
weary
miriam
listened
the
encircling
glooo
om
cardinal
newman
coming
back
from
italy
in
a
ship
in
the
end
he
had
gone
over
to
rome
high
altars
candles
incense
safety
and
warmth
from
far
away
a
radiance
seemed
to
approach
and
to
send
out
a
breath
that
touched
and
stirred
the
stuffy
air
the
imploring
voices
sang
on
poor
cold
english
things
miriam
suddenly
became
aware
of
emma
bergmann
standing
at
her
side
with
open
shaking
with
laughter
she
glanced
sternly
at
her
mastering
a
sympathetic
convulsion
emma
looked
so
sweet
standing
there
shaking
and
suffused
her
blue
eyes
were
full
of
tears
miriam
wanted
to
giggle
too
she
longed
to
know
what
had
amused
her
just
the
fact
of
their
all
standing
suddenly
there
together
she
dared
not
join
her
no
more
giggling
as
she
and
harriett
had
giggled
she
would
not
even
be
able
afterwards
to
ask
her
what
it
was
sitting
on
this
third
sunday
morning
in
the
dim
schloss
kirche
the
waldstrasse
pew
was
in
one
of
its
darkest
spaces
and
immediately
under
the
shadow
of
a
deeply
overhanging
gallery
miriam
understood
poor
emma
s
confessed
hysteria
over
the
abruptly
alternating
kneelings
and
standings
risings
and
sittings
of
an
anglican
congregation
here
there
was
no
need
to
be
on
the
watch
for
the
next
move
the
service
droned
quietly
and
slowly
on
miriam
paid
no
heed
to
it
she
sat
in
the
comforting
darkness
the
unobserving
germans
were
all
round
her
the
english
girls
tailed
away
invisibly
into
the
distant
obscurity
fraulein
pfaff
was
not
there
nor
mademoiselle
she
was
alone
with
the
school
she
felt
safe
for
a
while
and
derived
solace
from
the
reflection
that
there
would
always
be
church
if
she
were
a
governess
all
her
life
there
would
be
church
there
was
a
little
sting
of
guilt
in
the
thought
it
would
be
practising
deception
to
despise
it
all
to
hate
the
minister
and
the
choir
and
the
congregation
and
yet
to
come
running
she
could
imagine
herself
all
her
life
running
at
least
in
her
mind
weekly
to
some
church
working
her
fingers
into
their
gloves
and
pretending
to
take
everything
for
granted
and
to
be
just
like
everybody
else
and
really
thinking
only
of
getting
into
a
quiet
pew
and
ceasing
to
pretend
it
was
wrong
to
use
church
like
that
she
was
wrong
all
wrong
it
couldn
t
be
helped
who
was
there
who
could
help
her
she
imagined
herself
going
to
a
clergyman
and
saying
she
was
bad
and
wanted
to
be
good
even
crying
he
would
be
kind
and
would
pray
and
smile
and
she
would
be
told
to
listen
to
sermons
in
the
right
spirit
she
could
never
do
that
there
she
felt
she
was
on
solid
ground
listening
to
sermons
was
wrong
people
ought
to
refuse
to
be
preached
at
by
these
men
trying
to
listen
to
them
made
her
more
furious
than
anything
she
could
think
of
more
base
in
submitting
those
men
s
sermons
were
worse
than
women
s
smiles
just
as
insincere
at
any
rate
and
you
could
get
away
from
the
smiles
make
it
plain
you
did
not
agree
and
that
things
were
not
simple
and
settled
but
you
could
not
stop
a
sermon
it
was
so
unfair
the
service
might
be
lovely
if
you
did
not
listen
to
the
words
and
then
the
man
got
up
and
went
on
and
on
from
unsound
premises
until
your
brain
was
sick
droning
on
and
on
and
getting
more
and
more
pleased
with
himself
and
emphatic
and
nothing
behind
it
as
often
as
not
you
could
pick
out
the
logical
fallacy
if
you
took
the
trouble
preachers
knew
no
more
than
anyone
else
you
could
see
by
their
faces
sheeps
faces
what
a
terrible
life
and
wives
and
children
in
the
homes
taking
them
for
granted
certainly
it
was
wrong
to
listen
to
sermons
stultifying
unless
they
were
intellectual
lectures
like
brough
s
that
was
as
bad
because
they
were
not
sermons
either
kind
was
bad
and
ought
not
to
be
allowed
a
homily
sermons
homilies
a
quiet
homily
might
be
something
rather
nice
and
have
not
sounding
brass
and
tinkling
cymbal
caritas
i
have
i
am
sure
fraulein
pfaff
would
listen
she
would
smile
afterwards
and
talk
about
a
schone
predigt
certainly
if
she
should
ask
about
the
sermon
everything
would
come
out
then
what
would
be
the
good
fraulein
would
not
understand
it
would
be
better
to
pretend
she
could
not
think
of
any
woman
who
would
understand
and
she
would
be
obliged
to
live
somewhere
she
must
pretend
to
somebody
she
wanted
to
go
on
to
see
the
spring
but
must
she
always
be
pretending
would
it
always
be
that
living
with
exasperating
women
who
did
not
understand
pretending
grimacing
were
german
women
the
same
she
wished
she
could
tell
eve
the
things
she
was
beginning
to
feel
about
women
these
english
girls
were
just
the
same
millie
sweet
lovely
millie
how
she
wished
she
had
never
spoken
to
her
never
said
are
you
fond
of
crochet
millie
saying
you
must
know
all
my
people
and
then
telling
her
a
list
of
names
and
describing
all
her
family
she
had
been
so
pleased
for
the
first
moment
it
had
made
her
feel
suddenly
happy
to
hear
an
english
voice
talking
familiarly
to
her
in
the
saal
and
then
at
the
end
of
a
few
moments
she
had
known
she
never
wanted
to
hear
anything
more
of
millie
and
her
people
it
seemed
strange
that
this
girl
talking
about
her
brothers
hobbies
and
the
colour
of
her
sister
s
hair
was
the
millie
she
had
first
seen
the
night
of
the
vorspielen
with
the
madonna
face
and
no
feet
millie
was
smug
millie
would
smile
when
she
was
a
little
older
and
she
would
go
respectfully
to
church
all
her
life
miriam
had
felt
a
horror
even
of
the
millie
had
been
tidying
during
their
conversation
and
millie
had
gone
upstairs
she
knew
feeling
that
they
had
begun
to
be
friends
and
would
be
different
the
next
time
they
met
it
was
her
own
fault
what
had
made
her
speak
to
her
she
was
like
that
eve
had
told
her
she
got
excited
and
interested
in
people
and
then
wanted
to
throw
them
up
it
was
not
true
she
did
not
want
to
throw
them
up
she
wanted
them
to
leave
her
alone
she
had
not
been
excited
about
millie
it
was
ulrica
ulrica
ulrica
ulrica
sitting
up
at
breakfast
with
her
lovely
head
and
her
great
eyes
her
thin
fingers
peeling
an
egg
she
had
made
them
all
look
so
ulrica
was
different
was
she
yes
ulrica
was
different
ulrica
peeling
an
egg
and
she
afterwards
like
a
mad
thing
had
gone
into
the
saal
and
talked
to
millie
in
a
vulgar
familiar
way
no
doubt
and
that
had
led
to
that
dreadful
talk
with
gertrude
gertrude
s
voice
sounding
suddenly
behind
her
as
she
stood
looking
out
of
the
saal
window
and
their
talk
she
wished
gertrude
had
not
told
her
about
hugo
wieland
and
the
skating
she
was
sure
she
would
not
have
liked
erica
wieland
she
was
glad
she
had
left
she
was
my
chum
gertrude
had
said
and
he
taught
us
all
the
outside
edge
and
taught
me
it
was
funny
improper
that
these
schoolgirls
should
go
skating
with
other
girls
brothers
she
had
been
so
afraid
of
gertrude
that
she
had
pretended
to
be
interested
and
had
joked
with
her
she
miss
henderson
the
governess
had
said
knowingly
let
s
see
he
s
the
one
isn
t
he
gertrude
had
said
with
a
sort
of
winking
grimace
they
were
singing
a
hymn
the
people
near
her
had
not
moved
nobody
had
moved
the
whole
church
was
sitting
down
singing
a
hymn
what
wonderful
people
like
a
sort
of
everybody
sitting
about
not
sitting
up
to
the
table
happy
and
comfortable
emma
had
found
her
place
and
handed
her
a
big
with
the
score
there
was
time
for
miriam
to
read
the
first
line
and
recognise
the
original
of
now
thank
we
all
our
god
before
the
singing
had
reached
the
third
syllable
she
hung
over
the
book
nun
dank
et
al
le
now
thank
all
god
she
read
that
first
line
again
and
felt
how
much
better
the
thing
was
without
the
we
and
the
what
a
perfect
phrase
the
hymn
rolled
on
and
she
recognised
that
it
was
the
tune
she
knew
the
hard
square
tune
she
and
eve
had
called
it
and
harriett
used
to
mark
time
to
it
in
jerks
a
jerk
to
each
syllable
with
a
twisted
tip
just
under
the
book
ledge
with
her
left
hand
towards
miriam
but
sung
as
these
germans
sang
it
it
did
not
jerk
at
all
it
did
not
sound
like
a
proclamation
or
an
order
it
was
somehow
everyday
the
notes
seemed
to
hold
her
up
this
was
luther
germany
the
reformation
solid
and
quiet
she
glanced
up
and
then
hung
more
closely
over
her
book
it
was
the
windows
that
made
the
schloss
kirche
so
dark
one
movement
of
her
head
showed
her
that
all
the
windows
within
sight
were
dark
with
rich
colour
and
there
was
oak
everywhere
great
shelves
and
galleries
and
juttings
of
dark
wood
great
carved
masses
and
a
high
dim
roof
and
strange
spaces
of
light
twilight
and
light
like
moonlight
and
people
not
many
people
a
troop
a
little
army
under
the
high
roof
with
the
great
shadows
all
about
them
nun
danket
alle
there
was
nothing
to
object
to
in
that
everybody
could
say
that
everybody
fraulein
gertrude
all
these
little
figures
in
the
church
the
whole
world
now
thank
all
god
emma
and
marie
were
chanting
on
either
side
of
her
immediately
behind
her
sounded
the
quavering
voice
of
an
old
woman
they
all
felt
it
she
must
remember
that
think
of
it
every
day
chapter
v
during
those
early
days
miriam
realised
that
as
she
knew
it
the
planned
days
the
regular
unvarying
succession
of
lessons
and
preparations
had
no
place
in
this
new
world
even
the
masters
lessons
coming
in
from
outside
and
making
a
kind
of
framework
of
appointments
over
the
otherwise
fortuitously
occupied
days
were
she
soon
found
not
always
securely
calculable
herr
kapellmeister
bossenberger
would
be
heard
booming
and
intoning
in
the
hall
unexpectedly
at
all
hours
he
could
be
heard
all
over
the
house
miriam
had
never
seen
him
but
she
noticed
that
great
haste
was
always
made
to
get
a
pupil
to
the
saal
and
that
he
taught
impatiently
he
shouted
and
corrected
and
mimicked
only
millie
s
singing
apparently
he
left
untouched
you
could
hear
her
lilting
away
through
her
little
high
songs
as
serenely
as
she
did
at
vorspielen
miriam
was
at
once
sure
that
he
found
his
task
of
teaching
these
girls
an
extremely
tiresome
one
probably
most
teachers
found
teaching
tiresome
but
there
was
something
peculiar
and
new
to
her
in
herr
bossenberger
s
attitude
she
tried
to
account
for
it
german
men
despised
women
why
did
they
teach
them
anything
at
all
the
same
impression
the
sense
of
a
tuition
came
to
her
from
the
lectures
of
herr
winter
and
herr
schraub
herr
winter
a
thin
tall
man
with
shabby
hair
and
bony
hands
whose
veins
stood
up
in
knots
drummed
on
the
table
as
he
taught
botany
and
geography
the
girls
sat
round
bookless
and
politely
attentive
and
seemed
the
germans
at
least
to
remember
all
the
facts
for
which
he
appealed
during
the
last
few
minutes
of
his
hour
miriam
could
never
recall
anything
but
his
weary
withered
face
herr
schraub
the
teacher
of
history
was
she
felt
almost
openly
contemptuous
of
his
class
he
would
begin
lecturing
almost
before
he
was
inside
the
door
he
taught
from
a
book
sitting
with
downcast
eyes
his
round
red
mass
of
face
expressionless
save
for
the
bristling
spikes
of
his
tiny
moustache
and
the
rapid
movements
of
his
tight
rounded
little
lips
persistently
averted
from
his
pupils
for
the
last
few
minutes
of
his
time
he
would
ironically
his
eyes
fixed
ahead
of
him
at
a
point
on
the
table
snap
questions
indicating
his
aim
with
a
tapping
finger
going
round
the
table
like
a
dealer
at
cards
surely
the
girls
must
detest
him
the
germans
made
no
modification
of
their
polite
attentiveness
amongst
the
english
only
gertrude
and
the
martins
found
any
answers
for
him
miriam
proud
of
history
essays
and
the
full
marks
she
had
generally
claimed
for
them
had
no
memory
for
facts
and
dates
but
she
made
up
her
mind
that
were
she
ever
so
prepared
with
a
correct
reply
nothing
should
drag
from
her
any
response
to
these
military
tappings
fraulein
presided
over
these
lectures
from
the
corner
of
the
sofa
out
of
range
of
the
eye
of
the
teacher
and
horrified
miriam
by
voicelessly
prompting
the
girls
whenever
she
could
there
was
no
kind
of
preparation
for
these
lessons
miriam
mused
over
the
difference
between
the
bearing
of
these
men
and
that
of
the
masters
she
remembered
and
tried
to
find
words
what
was
it
had
her
masters
been
more
respectful
than
these
germans
were
she
felt
they
had
but
it
was
not
only
that
she
recalled
the
men
she
remembered
teaching
week
by
week
through
all
the
years
she
had
known
them
the
little
literature
master
an
albino
a
friend
of
browning
reading
reading
to
them
as
if
it
were
worth
while
as
if
they
were
equals
interested
friends
that
had
never
struck
her
at
the
time
but
it
was
true
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
felt
a
schoolgirl
or
being
talked
down
to
dear
stroodie
the
and
monsieur
old
whitehaired
monsieur
dearest
of
all
she
could
hear
his
gentle
voice
pleading
with
them
on
behalf
of
his
treasures
the
with
his
keen
friendly
blue
eye
the
briefless
barrister
who
had
taught
them
arithmetic
in
a
baritone
voice
laughing
all
the
time
but
really
wanting
them
to
get
on
what
was
it
she
missed
was
it
that
her
old
teachers
were
gentlemen
and
these
germans
were
not
she
pondered
over
this
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
whole
attitude
of
the
englishman
and
of
monsieur
her
one
frenchman
towards
her
sex
was
different
from
that
of
these
germans
it
occurred
to
her
once
in
a
flash
during
these
puzzled
musings
that
the
lessons
she
had
had
at
school
would
not
have
been
given
more
zestfully
more
as
if
it
were
worth
while
had
she
and
her
schoolfellows
been
boys
here
she
could
not
feel
that
the
teaching
was
grave
enough
the
masters
felt
the
importance
of
what
they
taught
she
felt
that
they
were
formal
reverently
formal
pompous
she
called
it
towards
the
facts
that
they
flung
out
down
the
long
schoolroom
table
but
that
the
relationship
of
their
pupils
to
these
facts
seemed
a
matter
of
less
indifference
to
them
she
began
to
recognise
now
with
a
glow
of
gratitude
that
her
own
teachers
those
who
were
enthusiastic
about
their
subjects
the
albino
her
dear
monsieur
with
his
classic
french
prose
a
young
woman
who
had
taught
them
logic
and
the
beginning
of
psychology
that
strange
new
subject
were
at
least
as
enthusiastic
about
getting
her
and
her
mates
awake
and
into
relationship
with
something
they
cared
somehow
she
recalled
the
albino
his
face
and
voice
generally
separated
from
his
class
by
a
book
held
vertically
close
to
his
left
eye
while
he
blocked
the
right
eye
with
his
free
hand
his
faintly
wheezy
tones
bleating
triumphantly
out
at
the
end
of
a
passage
from
the
ring
and
the
book
as
he
lowered
his
volume
and
bent
beaming
towards
them
all
his
right
eye
still
blocked
for
response
miss
donne
her
skimpy
skirt
powdered
with
chalk
explaining
a
syllogism
from
the
blackboard
turning
quietly
to
them
her
face
all
aglow
her
chalky
hands
gently
pressed
together
do
you
does
anyone
monsieur
spoiling
them
sharpening
their
pencils
letting
them
cheat
over
their
pages
of
rules
knowing
quite
well
that
each
learned
only
one
and
directing
his
questioning
accordingly
monsieur

over
the
things
he
read
to
them
repeating
passages
wandering
from
his
subject
making
allusions
here
and
there
and
all
of
them
she
at
any
rate
and
lilla
she
knew
often
in
paradise
how
rich
and
friendly
and
helpful
they
all
seemed
she
began
to
wonder
whether
hers
had
been
in
some
way
a
specially
good
school
things
had
mattered
there
somehow
the
girls
had
been
made
to
feel
they
mattered
she
remembered
even
old
stroodie
the
least
attached
member
of
the
staff
asking
her
suddenly
once
in
the
middle
of
a
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
her
life
and
a
day
when
the
artistic
who
was
a
connection
by
marriage
of
holman
hunt
s
and
had
met
ruskin
miriam
knew
several
times
had
gone
from
girl
to
girl
round
the
collected
fifth
and
sixth
forms
asking
them
each
what
they
would
best
like
to
do
in
life
miriam
had
answered
at
once
with
a
conviction
born
that
moment
that
she
wanted
to
write
a
it
irritated
her
when
she
remembered
during
these
reflections
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
give
to
fraulein
pfaff
s
public
questioning
any
intelligible
account
of
the
school
she
might
at
least
have
told
her
of
the
connection
with
ruskin
and
browning
and
holman
hunt
whereas
her
muddled
replies
had
led
fraulein
to
decide
that
her
school
had
been
a
kind
of
high
she
knew
it
had
not
been
this
she
felt
there
was
something
questionable
about
a
high
school
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
her
school
had
been
very
good
pater
had
seen
to
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
he
had
steered
and
seen
to
there
had
been
a
school
they
might
have
gone
to
higher
up
the
hill
where
one
learned
needlework
even
in
the
first
class
as
they
called
it
instead
of
the
sixth
form
as
at
her
school
and
calisthenics
instead
of
drilling
and
something
called
elocution
where
the
girls
were
it
was
an
expensive
school
had
the
teachers
there
taught
the
girls
as
if
they
had
no
minds
perhaps
that
school
was
more
like
the
one
she
found
herself
in
now
she
wondered
and
wondered
what
was
she
going
to
do
with
her
life
after
all
these
years
at
the
good
school
she
began
bit
by
bit
to
understand
her
agony
on
the
day
of
leaving
it
was
there
she
belonged
she
ought
to
go
back
and
go
on
one
day
she
lay
twisted
and
convulsed
face
downwards
on
her
bed
at
the
thought
that
she
could
never
go
back
and
begin
if
only
she
could
really
begin
now
knowing
what
she
wanted
she
would
talk
now
with
those
teachers
isn
t
it
all
wonderful
aren
t
things
wonderful
tell
me
some
more
she
felt
sure
that
if
she
could
go
back
things
would
get
clear
she
would
talk
and
think
and
understand
she
did
not
linger
over
that
it
threatened
a
storm
whose
results
would
be
visible
she
wondered
what
the
other
girls
were
doing
lilla
she
had
heard
nothing
of
her
since
that
last
term
she
would
write
to
her
one
day
perhaps
perhaps
not
she
would
have
to
tell
her
that
she
was
a
governess
lilla
would
think
that
very
funny
and
would
not
care
for
her
now
that
she
was
so
old
and
worried
woven
through
her
retrospective
appreciations
came
a
doubt
she
wondered
whether
after
all
her
school
had
been
right
whether
it
ought
to
have
treated
them
all
so
seriously
if
she
had
gone
to
the
other
school
she
was
sure
she
would
never
have
heard
of
the
aesthetic
movement
or
felt
troubled
about
the
state
of
ireland
and
india
perhaps
she
would
have
grown
up
a
churchwoman
and
never
she
could
only
think
that
somehow
she
must
be
different
that
a
sprinkling
of
the
girls
collected
in
that
school
were
different
too
the
school
she
decided
was
new
modern
ruskin
most
of
the
girls
perhaps
had
not
been
affected
by
it
but
some
had
she
had
the
thought
stirred
her
she
had
it
was
mysterious
was
it
the
school
or
herself
herself
to
begin
with
if
she
had
been
brought
up
differently
it
could
not
she
felt
sure
have
made
her
very
different
for
long
nor
taught
her
to
be
affable
to
smile
that
smile
she
hated
so
the
school
had
done
something
to
her
it
had
not
gone
against
the
things
she
found
in
herself
she
wondered
once
or
twice
during
these
early
weeks
what
she
would
have
been
like
if
she
had
been
brought
up
with
these
german
girls
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
their
lives
was
only
too
plain
all
but
emma
she
had
been
astounded
to
discover
had
already
a
complete
outfit
of
to
which
they
were
now
adding
fine
embroideries
and
laces
all
could
cook
minna
had
startled
her
one
day
by
exclaiming
with
lit
face
ach
ich
koche
so
gern
oh
i
am
so
frightfully
fond
of
cooking
and
they
were
placid
and
serene
secure
in
a
kind
of
security
miriam
had
never
met
before
they
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
least
afraid
of
the
future
she
envied
that
their
eyes
and
their
hands
were
serene
they
would
have
houses
and
things
they
could
do
and
understand
always
how
they
must
want
to
begin
she
mused
what
a
prison
school
must
seem
she
thought
of
their
comfortable
german
homes
of
ruling
and
shopping
and
directing
and
being
looked
up
to
german
husbands
that
thought
she
shirked
emma
in
particular
she
could
not
contemplate
in
relation
to
a
german
husband
in
any
case
one
day
these
girls
would
be
as
clara
looked
now
they
would
look
like
the
german
women
on
the
boulevards
and
in
the
shops
in
the
end
she
ceased
to
wonder
that
the
german
masters
dealt
out
their
wares
to
these
girls
so
superciliously
and
yet
german
music
a
line
of
german
poetry
a
sudden
light
on
clara
s
face
there
was
one
other
teacher
a
swiss
and
some
sort
of
minister
she
supposed
as
everyone
called
him
the
herr
pastor
she
wondered
whether
he
was
in
any
sense
the
spiritual
adviser
of
the
school
and
regarded
him
with
provisional
suspicion
she
had
seen
him
once
sitting
short
and
very
black
and
white
at
the
head
of
the
schoolroom
table
his
black
beard
and
dark
eyes
as
he
sat
with
his
back
to
the
window
made
his
face
gleam
like
a
mask
he
had
spoken
very
rapidly
as
he
told
the
girls
the
of
some
poet
the
time
that
was
not
taken
up
by
the
masters
and
the
regular
succession
of
rich
and
savoury
meals
wastefully
plentiful
they
seemed
to
miriam
was
filled
in
by
fraulein
pfaff
with
occupations
devised
apparently
from
hour
to
hour
on
a
master
s
morning
the
girls
collected
in
the
schoolroom
one
by
one
as
they
finished
their
and
dusting
on
other
days
the
time
immediately
after
breakfast
was
full
of
uncertainty
and
surmise
judging
from
the
interchange
between
the
four
bedrooms
whose
doors
were
always
open
during
this
bustling
interval
miriam
listening
apprehensively
as
she
did
her
share
of
work
on
the
top
floor
gathered
that
the
lack
of
any
planned
programme
was
a
standing
annoyance
to
the
english
girls
millie
still
imperfectly
acclimatised
carrying
out
her
duties
in
a
large
bibbed
apron
was
plaintive
about
it
in
her
conscientious
german
nearly
every
morning
the
martins
when
the
sense
of
fraulein
as
providence
was
strong
upon
them
made
their
beds
vindictively
rapping
out
sarcasms
to
be
alternately
mocked
and
giggled
at
by
jimmie
who
was
generally
heard
as
the
gusts
subsided
dispensing
the
comforting
assurance
that
it
wouldn
t
last
for
ever
miriam
once
heard
even
judy
grumbling
to
herself
in
a
mumbling
undertone
as
she
carried
the
lower
landing
s
collective
wasche
upstairs
to
the
back
attic
to
await
the
quarterly
waschfrau
the
german
side
of
the
landing
was
uncritical
on
free
mornings
the
germans
had
one
preoccupation
it
was
generally
betrayed
by
emma
in
a
loud
excited
whisper
aimed
across
the
landing
gehen
wir
zu
kreipe
do
we
go
to
kreipe
s
kreipe
kreipe
minna
and
clara
would
chorus
devoutly
from
their
respective
rooms
gertrude
on
these
occasions
always
had
an
air
of
knowledge
and
would
sometimes
prophesy
to
what
extent
fraulein
did
confide
in
the
girl
and
how
much
was
due
to
her
experience
of
the
elder
woman
s
habit
of
mind
miriam
could
never
determine
but
her
prophecies
were
always
fulfilled
fraulein
who
generally
went
to
the
basement
kitchen
from
the
would
be
heard
on
the
landing
towards
the
end
of
the
busy
rallying
and
criticising
the
housemaids
in
her
gentle
caustic
voice
she
never
came
to
the
top
floor
miriam
and
mademoiselle
who
agreed
in
accomplishing
their
duties
with
great
despatch
and
spending
any
spare
time
sitting
in
their
jackets
on
their
respective
beds
reading
or
talking
would
listen
for
her
departure
there
was
always
a
moment
when
they
knew
that
the
excitement
was
over
and
the
landing
stricken
into
certainty
then
mademoiselle
would
flit
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
demand
leaning
over
the
balustrade
eh
bien
eh
bien
and
someone
would
retail
directions
sometimes
anna
would
appear
in
her
short
chequered
cotton
dress
shawled
and
with
her
market
basket
on
her
arm
and
would
summon
gertrude
alone
or
with
solomon
martin
to
fraulein
s
room
opposite
the
saal
on
the
ground
floor
the
appearance
of
anna
was
the
signal
for
bounding
anticipations
it
nearly
always
meant
a
holiday
and
an
expedition
during
the
cold
weeks
after
miriam
s
arrival
there
were
no
expeditions
and
very
commonly
uncertainty
was
prolonged
by
a
provisional
distribution
of
the
ten
girls
between
the
kitchen
and
the
five
pianos
in
this
case
neither
she
nor
mademoiselle
received
any
instructions
mademoiselle
would
go
to
the
saal
with
needlework
generally
the
lighter
household
mending
the
saal
piano
at
practising
time
was
allotted
to
the
pupil
to
whom
the
next
music
lesson
was
due
and
mademoiselle
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
time
installed
either
awaiting
the
possible
arrival
of
herr
bossenberger
or
presiding
over
his
lessons
when
he
came
miriam
events
would
watch
her
disappear
unconcernedly
through
the
folding
doors
every
time
with
fresh
wonder
she
did
not
want
to
take
her
place
though
it
would
have
meant
listening
to
herr
bossenberger
s
teaching
and
a
quiet
alcove
of
freedom
from
the
apprehensive
uncertainty
that
hung
over
so
many
of
her
hours
it
seemed
to
her
odd
not
quite
the
thing
to
have
a
third
person
in
the
room
at
a
music
lesson
she
tried
to
imagine
a
lesson
being
given
to
herself
under
these
conditions
the
thought
was
complete
insensibility
to
music
her
eyes
bent
on
her
work
the
quick
movements
of
her
small
thin
hands
the
darting
gleam
of
her
thimble
the
dry
way
she
had
of
clearing
her
throat
a
gesture
that
was
an
accentuation
of
the
slightly
metallic
quality
of
her
voice
and
expressed
for
miriam
in
sound
that
curious
sense
of
circumspect
frugality
she
was
growing
to
realise
as
characteristic
of
mademoiselle
s
face
in
repose
the
saal
doors
closed
the
little
door
leading
into
the
hall
became
the
centre
of
miriam
s
attention
before
long
sometimes
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
this
door
would
open
and
the
day
become
eventful
she
had
already
taken
clara
with
emma
to
make
a
third
three
times
to
her
masseuse
sitting
for
half
an
hour
in
a
room
above
a
chemist
s
shop
so
stuffy
beyond
anything
in
her
experience
that
she
had
carried
away
nothing
but
the
sense
of
its
odours
a
dim
picture
of
clara
in
a
wrapper
and
the
shocked
impression
of
the
resounding
thwackings
undergone
by
her
emma
was
paying
a
series
of
visits
to
the
dentist
and
might
appear
at
the
schoolroom
door
with
frightened
eyes
holding
it
open
hendchen
ich
muss
zum
miriam
dreaded
these
excursions
the
first
time
miriam
had
accompanied
her
emma
had
had
miriam
assailed
by
a
loud
scream
followed
by
the
peremptory
voices
of
two
fiercely
moustached
operators
one
of
whom
seemed
to
be
holding
emma
in
the
chair
had
started
from
her
sofa
in
the
background
brutes
she
had
declared
and
reached
the
voluble
in
unintelligible
german
to
find
emma
serenely
emerging
from
unconsciousness
once
she
had
taken
gertrude
to
the
dentist
another
dentist
an
elderly
man
practising
in
a
in
a
room
with
high
sash
windows
the
lower
sashes
filled
with
stained
glass
there
had
been
a
driving
march
wind
and
gertrude
with
a
shawl
round
her
face
had
battled
gallantly
along
shouting
through
her
shawl
miriam
had
made
out
nothing
clearly
but
the
fact
that
the
dentist
s
wife
had
a
title
in
her
own
right
gertrude
had
gone
through
her
trial
prolonged
by
some
slight
complication
without
an
anesthetic
in
alternations
of
tense
silence
and
great
gusts
of
her
hacking
laughter
miriam
sitting
strained
in
the
far
background
near
a
screen
covered
with
a
mass
of
strange
embroideries
wondered
how
she
really
felt
that
she
realised
with
a
vision
of
gertrude
going
on
through
life
in
smart
costumes
one
would
never
know
the
thing
miriam
dreaded
most
acutely
was
a
visit
with
minna
to
her
aurist
she
learned
with
horror
that
minna
was
obliged
every
few
months
to
submit
to
a
series
of
small
operations
at
the
hands
of
the
tall
man
with
large
clear
impersonal
eyes
who
carried
on
his
practice
high
up
in
a
great
block
of
buildings
in
a
small
faded
room
with
coarse
curtains
at
its
smudgy
windows
the
character
of
his
surroundings
added
a
great
deal
to
her
abhorrence
of
his
attentions
to
minna
the
room
was
densely
saturated
with
an
odour
which
she
guessed
to
be
that
of
stale
it
seemed
so
tangible
in
the
room
that
she
looked
about
at
first
for
visible
signs
of
its
presence
it
was
like
an
invisible
fog
and
seemed
to
affect
her
breathing
coming
and
going
upon
the
dense
staleness
of
the
room
and
pervading
the
immediate
premises
was
a
strange
savoury
pungency
miriam
could
not
at
first
identify
it
but
as
the
visits
multiplied
and
she
noticed
the
same
odour
standing
in
faint
patches
here
and
there
about
the
stairways
and
corridors
of
the
block
it
dawned
upon
her
that
it
must
be
onions
onions
freshly
frying
but
with
a
quality
of
accumulated
richness
that
she
could
not
explain
but
the
fact
of
the
dominating
kitchen
side
by
side
with
the
made
her
speculate
she
imagined
the
doctor
s
wife
probably
in
that
kitchen
a
bony
north
german
woman
she
saw
the
man
at
his
meals
and
imagined
his
slippers
there
were
dingy
books
in
the
room
where
minna
started
and
moaned
she
compared
this
entourage
with
her
recollection
of
her
one
visit
to
an
oculist
in
harley
street
his
stately
house
the
exquisite
freshness
of
his
appointments
and
his
person
stood
out
now
the
english
she
assured
herself
were
more
refined
than
the
germans
even
the
local
doctor
at
barnes
whose
effect
upon
her
mother
s
perpetual
upon
eve
s
nerves
and
sarah
s
mysterious
indigestion
was
so
impermanent
that
the
very
sound
of
his
name
exasperated
her
had
something
about
him
that
she
failed
entirely
to
find
in
this
german
something
she
could
respect
she
wondered
whether
the
professional
classes
in
germany
were
all
like
this
specialist
and
living
in
this
way
minna
s
parents
she
knew
were
paying
large
fees
these
dreaded
expeditions
brought
a
compensation
her
liking
for
minna
grew
with
each
visit
she
wondered
at
her
here
she
was
with
her
nose
and
her
ear
she
was
subject
to
rheumatism
too
it
would
always
miriam
reflected
be
doctor
s
treatment
for
her
she
wondered
at
her
perpetual
cheerfulness
she
saw
her
with
a
pang
of
pity
going
through
life
with
her
illnesses
capped
in
defiance
of
all
the
care
she
bestowed
on
her
person
with
her
disconcerting
nose
a
nose
she
reflected
that
would
do
splendidly
for
charades
on
several
occasions
a
little
contingent
selected
from
the
pianos
and
kitchen
had
appeared
in
the
schoolroom
and
settled
down
to
read
german
with
fraulein
miriam
had
been
despatched
to
a
piano
after
these
readings
the
of
sweet
soup
or
chocolate
soup
or
perhaps
glasses
of
sweet
syrup
and
biscuits
were
if
fraulein
were
safely
out
of
earshot
voluble
indignation
meetings
if
she
were
known
to
be
in
the
room
beyond
the
little
schoolroom
lunch
was
taken
in
silence
except
for
gertrude
s
sallies
cheerful
generalisations
from
minna
or
jimmie
and
grudging
murmurs
of
response
on
the
mornings
of
fraulein
s
german
readings
the
school
never
went
to
kreipe
s
going
to
kreipe
s
miriam
perceived
was
a
sign
of
fair
weather
they
had
been
twice
since
her
coming
sitting
at
a
little
table
with
the
bergmanns
near
the
window
and
overlooking
the
full
flood
of
the
georgstrasse
miriam
felt
a
keen
renewal
of
the
sense
of
being
abroad
here
she
sat
in
the
little
enclosure
of
this
upper
room
above
a
shopful
of
strange
delikatessen
securely
adrift
behind
her
she
felt
not
home
but
the
german
school
where
she
belonged
here
they
all
sat
free
germany
was
all
around
them
they
were
in
the
midst
of
it
fraulein
pfaff
seemed
far
away
how
strange
of
her
to
send
them
there
she
glanced
towards
the
two
tables
of
english
girls
in
the
centre
of
the
room
wondering
whether
they
felt
as
she
did
they
had
come
to
germany
they
were
sharing
it
with
her
it
must
he
changing
them
they
must
be
different
for
having
come
they
would
all
go
back
she
supposed
but
they
would
not
be
the
same
as
those
who
had
never
come
she
was
sure
they
felt
something
of
this
they
were
sitting
about
in
easy
attitudes
how
english
they
all
looked
for
a
moment
she
wanted
to
go
and
sit
with
them
just
sit
with
them
rejoice
in
being
abroad
in
having
got
away
she
imagined
all
their
people
looking
in
and
seeing
them
so
thoroughly
at
home
in
this
little
german
restaurant
free
from
home
influences
in
a
little
world
of
their
own
she
felt
a
pang
of
response
as
she
heard
their
confidently
raised
voices
she
could
see
they
were
all
even
judy
a
little
excited
they
chaffed
each
other
gertrude
had
taken
everyone
s
choice
between
coffee
and
chocolate
and
given
an
order
orders
for
schocolade
were
heard
from
all
over
the
room
there
were
only
women
there
wonderful
german
women
in
twos
and
threes
ladies
out
shopping
miriam
supposed
she
managed
intermittently
to
watch
three
or
four
of
them
and
wondered
what
kind
of
conversation
made
them
so
emphatic
whether
it
was
because
they
held
themselves
so
well
and
spoke
out
that
everything
they
said
seemed
so
important
she
had
never
seen
women
with
so
much
decision
in
their
bearing
she
found
herself
drawing
herself
up
she
heard
german
laughter
about
the
room
the
sounds
excited
her
and
she
watched
eagerly
for
laughing
faces
they
were
different
the
laughter
sounded
differently
and
the
laughing
faces
were
different
the
eyes
were
expressionless
as
they
laughed
or
evil
they
had
that
same
knowing
way
of
laughing
as
though
everything
were
settled
but
they
did
not
pretend
to
be
refined
as
englishwomen
did
they
had
the
same
horridness
but
they
were
jolly
they
could
shout
if
they
liked
three
cups
of
chocolate
each
supporting
a
little
hillock
of
solid
cream
arrived
at
her
table
clara
ordered
cakes
at
the
first
sip
taken
with
lips
that
slid
helplessly
on
the
surprisingly
thick
rim
of
her
cup
miriam
renounced
all
the
beverages
she
had
ever
known
as
unworthy
she
chose
a
eclair
clara
and
emma
ate
cakes
that
seemed
to
be
alternate
slices
of
cream
and
very
spongy
cake
and
then
followed
emma
s
lead
with
an
open
tartlet
on
which
plump
green
gooseberries
stood
in
a
thick
brown
syrup
during
dinner
fraulein
pfaff
went
the
round
of
the
table
with
questions
as
to
what
had
been
consumed
at
kreipe
s
the
whole
of
the
table
on
her
right
confessed
to
one
kuchen
with
their
chocolate
in
each
case
she
smiled
gravely
and
required
the
cake
to
be
described
the
meaning
of
the
pilgrimage
of
enquiry
came
to
miriam
when
fraulein
reached
gertrude
and
beamed
affectionately
in
response
to
her
careless
schokolade
und
ein
miriam
and
the
bergmanns
were
alone
in
their
excesses
even
walks
were
incalculable
excepting
on
saturdays
when
at
noon
anna
turned
out
the
schoolrooms
then
unless
to
miriam
s
great
satisfaction
it
rained
and
they
had
a
little
festival
shut
in
in
holiday
mood
in
the
saal
the
girls
playing
and
singing
anna
loudly
obliterating
the
next
door
and
the
secure
harbour
of
sunday
ahead
they
went
methodically
out
and
promenaded
the
streets
of
hanover
for
an
hour
these
saturday
walks
were
a
recurring
humiliation
if
they
had
occurred
daily
some
crisis
she
felt
sure
would
have
arisen
for
her
the
little
party
would
file
out
under
the
leadership
of
gertrude
fraulein
pfaff
smiling
parting
directions
adjuring
them
to
come
back
safe
and
happy
to
the
beehive
and
stabbing
at
them
all
the
while
miriam
felt
with
her
keen
eye
through
the
high
doorway
that
pierced
the
high
wall
and
then
charge
down
the
street
gertrude
alone
having
been
in
hanover
and
under
fraulein
pfaff
s
care
since
her
ninth
year
was
instructed
as
to
the
detail
of
their
tour
and
she
swung
striding
on
ahead
the
ends
of
her
long
fur
boa
flying
out
in
the
march
wind
making
a
flourishing
scrollwork
round
her
hounding
form
the
martins
and
with
hard
cloth
jackets
and
hard
felt
hats
and
short
thick
pelerines
almost
running
on
either
side
jimmie
millie
and
judy
hard
behind
miriam
s
joyous
sense
of
emergence
and
her
longing
to
go
leisurely
and
alone
along
these
wonderful
streets
to
go
on
and
on
at
first
and
presently
to
look
had
to
give
way
to
the
necessity
of
keeping
gertrude
and
her
companions
in
sight
on
they
went
relentlessly
through
the
saturday
throng
along
the
great
georgstrasse
a
foreign
paradise
with
its
great
bright
cafes
and
the
strange
promising
detail
of
its
shops
tantalisingly
half
seen
she
hated
too
the
discomfort
of
walking
thus
at
this
pace
through
streets
along
pavements
in
her
winter
clothes
they
hampered
her
horribly
her
heavy
length
coat
made
her
too
warm
and
bumped
against
her
as
she
hurried
along
the
little
fur
pelerine
which
redeemed
its
plainness
tickled
her
neck
and
she
felt
the
outline
of
her
stiff
hat
like
a
board
against
her
uneasy
forehead
her
inflexible
boots
soon
tired
her
but
these
things
she
could
have
endured
they
were
not
the
main
source
of
her
trouble
she
could
have
renounced
the
delights
all
round
her
made
terms
with
the
discomforts
and
looked
for
alleviations
but
it
was
during
these
walks
that
she
began
to
perceive
that
she
was
making
in
a
way
she
had
not
at
all
anticipated
a
complete
failure
of
her
role
of
english
teacher
the
three
weeks
haphazard
curriculum
had
brought
only
one
repetition
of
her
english
lesson
in
the
smaller
schoolroom
and
excepting
at
meals
when
whatever
conversation
there
was
was
general
and
polyglot
she
was
never
in
the
house
alone
with
her
german
pupils
the
cessation
of
the
fixed
readings
arranged
with
her
that
first
day
by
fraulein
pfaff
did
not
in
face
of
the
general
absence
of
method
at
all
disturb
her
mademoiselle
s
classes
had
she
discovered
except
for
the
weekly
mending
long
since
lapsed
altogether
these
walks
she
soon
realised
were
supposed
to
be
her
and
her
pupils
opportunity
no
doubt
fraulein
pfaff
believed
that
they
represented
so
many
hours
of
english
conversation
and
they
did
not
it
was
cheating
pure
and
simple
she
thought
of
parents
of
the
probable
prospectus
french
and
english
her
growing
conviction
and
the
distress
of
it
were
confirmed
each
week
by
a
spectacle
she
could
not
escape
and
was
rapidly
growing
to
hate
just
in
front
of
her
and
considerably
behind
the
flying
van
her
full
wincey
skirt
billowing
out
beneath
what
seemed
to
miriam
a
dreadfully
thin
little
stockinette
jacket
trotted
mademoiselle
one
hand
to
the
plain
brim
of
her
large
french
hat
and
obviously
conversational
with
either
minna
and
elsa
or
clara
and
emma
on
either
side
of
her
generally
it
was
minna
and
elsa
minna
brisk
and
trim
and
decorous
as
to
her
neat
plaid
skirt
however
hurried
and
elsa
showing
her
distress
by
the
frequent
twisting
of
one
or
other
of
her
ankles
which
looked
to
miriam
like
sticks
above
her
shoes
mademoiselle
s
broad
flapped
as
her
head
turned
from
one
companion
to
the
other
sometimes
miriam
caught
the
mocking
tinkle
of
her
laughter
that
all
three
were
interested
too
miriam
gathered
from
the
fact
that
they
could
not
always
be
relied
upon
to
follow
gertrude
the
little
party
had
returned
one
day
in
two
separate
groups
fortunately
meeting
before
the
waldstrasse
gate
was
reached
owing
to
mademoiselle
s
failure
to
keep
gertrude
in
sight
there
was
no
doubt
too
that
the
medium
of
their
intercourse
was
french
for
mademoiselle
s
knowledge
of
german
had
not
for
all
her
six
months
at
the
school
got
beyond
a
few
simple
and
badly
managed
words
and
phrases
miriam
felt
that
this
french
girl
was
perfectly
carrying
out
fraulein
pfaff
s
design
she
talked
to
her
pupils
made
them
talk
the
girls
were
amused
and
happy
and
were
picking
up
french
it
was
admirable
and
it
was
wonderful
to
miriam
because
she
felt
quite
sure
that
mademoiselle
had
no
clear
idea
in
her
own
mind
that
she
was
carrying
out
any
design
at
all
that
irritated
miriam
mademoiselle
liked
talking
to
her
girls
miriam
was
beginning
to
know
that
she
did
not
want
to
talk
to
her
girls
almost
from
the
first
she
had
begun
to
know
it
she
felt
sure
that
if
fraulein
pfaff
had
been
invisibly
present
at
any
one
of
her
solitary
conversational
encounters
with
these
german
girls
she
would
have
been
judged
and
condemned
elsa
speier
had
been
the
worst
miriam
could
see
as
she
thought
of
her
the
angle
of
the
high
garden
wall
of
a
corner
house
in
waldstrasse
and
above
it
a
blossoming
almond
tree
how
lovely
that
tree
is
she
had
said
she
remembered
trying
hard
to
talk
and
to
make
her
talk
and
making
no
impression
upon
the
girl
she
remembered
monosyllables
and
the
pallid
averted
face
and
elsa
s
dreadful
ankles
she
had
walked
along
intent
and
indifferent
and
presently
she
had
felt
a
sort
of
irritation
rise
through
her
struggling
and
then
further
on
in
the
walk
she
could
not
remember
how
it
had
arisen
there
was
a
moment
when
elsa
had
said
with
unmoved
averted
face
hurriedly
my
fazzer
is
offitser
and
it
seemed
to
miriam
as
if
this
were
the
answer
to
everything
she
had
tried
to
say
to
her
remark
about
the
and
everything
else
and
then
she
felt
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
between
them
they
were
both
quite
silent
everything
seemed
settled
miriam
s
mind
called
up
a
picture
of
a
man
in
a
saxon
blue
uniform
all
voice
and
no
brains
and
going
to
take
to
gardening
in
his
old
age
and
longed
to
tell
elsa
of
her
contempt
for
all
military
men
clearly
she
felt
elsa
s
and
elsa
s
mother
s
feeling
towards
herself
elsa
s
mother
had
thin
ankles
too
and
was
like
elsa
intent
and
cold
and
dead
she
could
imagine
elsa
in
society
now
hard
and
thin
and
glittery
she
would
be
stylish
military
men
s
women
always
were
the
girl
had
avoided
being
with
her
during
walks
since
then
and
they
never
voluntarily
addressed
one
another
minna
and
the
bergmanns
had
talked
to
her
minna
responded
to
everything
she
said
in
her
eager
husky
voice
not
because
she
was
interested
miriam
felt
but
because
she
was
polite
and
it
had
tired
her
once
or
twice
dreadfully
to
go
on
making
conversation
with
minna
she
had
wanted
to
like
being
with
these
three
she
felt
she
could
give
them
something
it
made
her
full
of
solicitude
to
glance
at
either
of
them
at
her
side
she
had
longed
to
feel
at
home
with
them
and
to
teach
them
things
worth
teaching
they
seemed
pitiful
in
some
way
like
children
in
her
hands
she
did
not
know
how
to
begin
all
her
efforts
and
their
efforts
left
them
just
as
pitiful
each
occasion
left
her
more
puzzled
and
helpless
now
and
again
she
thought
there
was
going
to
be
a
change
she
would
feel
a
stirring
of
animation
in
her
companions
then
she
would
discover
that
someone
was
being
discussed
generally
one
of
the
girls
or
perhaps
they
were
beginning
to
tell
her
something
about
fraulein
pfaff
or
talking
about
food
these
topics
made
her
feel
ill
at
ease
at
once
things
were
going
wrong
it
was
not
to
discuss
such
things
that
they
were
together
out
in
the
air
in
the
wonderful
streets
and
boulevards
of
hanover
she
would
grow
cold
and
constrained
and
the
conversation
would
drop
and
then
suddenly
within
a
day
or
so
of
each
other
dreadful
things
had
happened
the
first
had
come
on
the
second
occasion
of
her
going
with
minna
to
see
dieckel
minna
as
they
were
walking
quietly
along
together
had
suddenly
begun
in
a
broken
english
which
soon
turned
to
shy
fluent
animated
german
to
tell
about
a
friend
an
a
man
miriam
gathered
missing
many
links
in
her
amazement
in
a
shop
the
chemist
s
shop
where
her
parents
dealt
in
the
little
country
town
in
pomerania
which
was
her
home
minna
was
so
altered
looked
so
radiantly
happy
whilst
she
talked
about
this
man
that
miriam
had
wanted
to
put
out
a
hand
and
touch
her
afterwards
she
could
recall
the
sound
of
her
voice
as
it
was
at
that
moment
with
its
yearning
and
its
promise
and
its
absolute
confidence
minna
was
so
certain
of
her
happiness
at
the
end
of
each
hurried
little
phrase
her
voice
sounded
like
a
chord
like
three
strings
sounding
at
once
on
some
strange
instrument
and
soon
afterwards
emma
had
told
her
very
gravely
with
clara
walking
a
little
aloof
her
doglike
eyes
shining
as
she
gazed
into
the
distance
of
a
most
beautiful
man
with
a
brown
moustache
with
whom
clara
was
in
love
he
was
there
in
the
town
in
hanover
a
treating
clara
s
thin
short
hair
even
emma
had
a
he
had
a
very
vulgar
surname
too
vulgar
to
be
spoken
it
was
breathed
against
miriam
s
shoulder
in
the
miriam
was
begged
to
forget
it
at
once
and
to
remember
only
the
beautiful
little
name
that
preceded
it
at
the
time
she
had
timidly
responded
to
all
these
stories
and
had
felt
glad
that
the
confidences
had
come
to
her
mademoiselle
she
knew
had
never
received
them
but
after
these
confidences
there
were
no
more
serious
attempts
at
general
conversation
miriam
felt
ashamed
of
her
share
in
the
hairdresser
and
the
chemist
emma
s
jungling
might
possibly
be
a
student
she
grieved
over
the
things
that
she
felt
were
lying
neglected
things
in
general
she
felt
sure
she
ought
to
discuss
with
the
girls
improving
the
world
leaving
it
better
than
you
found
it
the
importance
of
life
sleeping
and
dreaming
that
life
was
beauty
and
waking
and
finding
it
was
duty
making
things
better
reforming
being
a
reformer
pater
always
said
young
people
always
wanted
to
reform
the
universe
perhaps
it
was
so
and
nothing
could
be
done
clearly
she
was
not
the
one
to
do
anything
she
could
do
nothing
even
with
these
girls
and
she
was
nearly
eighteen
once
or
twice
she
wondered
whether
they
ever
had
thoughts
about
things
she
felt
they
must
if
only
she
were
not
shy
if
she
had
a
different
manner
she
would
find
out
she
knew
she

the

and
as
soon
as

she
began
talking
in
a
gentle
decisive
voice

for

both

and

enough
to

intently
miriam
tried
to
remember
the

of

of

jimmie
fraulein
raised
her
voice
slightly
still
smiling
miriam
heard
her
own

and
stiffened

and
our

the

fraulein
s
voice
had
thickened
and
grown
caressing
perhaps
no
one
was
in
trouble
ulrica
bowed
her
startled
eyes
and
the
outline
of
her
pale
face
remained
unchanged
still
gentle
and
fraulein
reached
judy
and
the
germans
all
was
well

in

judy
s
downcast
crimson
face
began
to
recover
its
normal
clear
flush
and
the
germans
joined
in
the
general
rejoicing
they
were
to
go
miriam
gathered
in
the
afternoon
to
the
baths
she
had
never
been
to
a
public
baths
she
wished
fraulein
could
know
there
were
two
bathrooms
in
the
house
at
barnes
and
then
wondered
whether
in
german
baths
one
was
left
to
oneself
or
whether
there
too
there
would
be
some
woman
superintending
fraulein
jested
softly
on
about
her
children
and
their
bath
gertrude
and
jimmie
recalled
incidents
of
former
bathings
the
stories
went
on
until
breakfast
had
prolonged
itself
into
a
sitting
of
happy
adventurers
the
room
was
very
warm
and
clara
at
her
corner
sat
with
an
outstretched
arm
nearly
touching
fraulein
pfaff
who
was
sitting
forward
glowing
and
shedding
the
light
of
her
dark
young
eyes
on
each
in
turn
there
were
many
elbows
on
the
table
judy
s
head
was
raised
and
easy
miriam
noticed
that
the
whiteness
of
her
neck
was
whiter
than
those
strange
bright
patches
where
her
eyelashes
shone
ulrica
s
eyes
went
from
face
to
face
as
she
listened
and
miriam
fed
upon
the
outlines
of
her
head
she
wished
she
could
place
her
hands
on
either
side
of
its
slenderness
and
feel
the
delicate
skull
and
gaze
undisturbed
into
the
eyes
fraulein
pfaff
rose
at
last
from
the
table
na

she
smiled
holding
her
arms
out
to
them
all
she
turned
to
the
nearest
window
die

she
cried
in
quivering
tones
die

up
with
windows
up
with
hearts
her
hands
struggled
with
the
hasp
of
the
outer
frame
the
girls
crowded
round
as
the
lattices
swung
wide
the
air
poured
in
miriam
stood
in
a
vague
crowd
seeing
nothing
she
felt
the
movement
of
her
own
breathing
and
the
cool
streaming
of
the
air
through
her
nostrils
she
felt
comely
and
strong
that
s
a
thrush
she
heard
bertha
martin
say
as
a
chattering
flew
across
a
distant
garden
and
fraulein
s
reply
know
you
children
what
the
thrush
says
know
you
and
minna
s
eager
voice
sounding
out
into
the
open
d

and
voices
imitating

breathed
clara
in
a
low
miriam
found
herself
with
her
hands
on
the
doors
leading
into
the
saal
pushing
them
gently
why
not
everything
had
changed
everything
was
good
the
great
doors
gave
the
sunlight
streamed
from
behind
her
into
the
quiet
saal
she
went
along
the
pathway
it
made
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
voices
from
the
schoolroom
came
softly
far
away
she
went
to
the
centre
window
and
pushing
aside
its
heavy
curtains
saw
for
the
first
time
that
it
had
no
second
pane
like
the
others
but
led
directly
into
a
sort
of
open
in
front
and
leading
by
a
wooden
stairway
down
to
the
garden
plot
up
the
railing
of
the
stairway
and
over
the
entrance
of
the
a
creeping
plant
was
putting
out
tiny
leaves
it
was
in
shadow
but
the
sun
caught
the
sharply
peaked
gable
of
the
and
on
the
left
the
tops
of
the
high
shrubs
lining
the
pathway
leading
to
the
wooden
door
and
the
great
balls
finishing
the
high
stone
gateway
shone
yellow
with
sunlit
lichen
she
heard
the
schoolroom
windows
close
and
the
girls
clearing
away
the
breakfast
things
and
escaped
upstairs
singing
before
she
had
finished
her
duties
a
summons
came
jimmie
brought
the
message
panting
as
she
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
hurry

hendy
she
gasped

one
of
the
distinguished

my
dear
what

miriam
began
apprehensively
as
she
turned
to
go
oh

she
tried
to
laugh
ingratiatingly
tell
me
what
you
mean
jimmie
turned
and
raised
a
plump
hand
with
a
little
finger
and
a
dangle
of
handkerchief
you
re
a
my
dear
you
re
in

specials

old
i
ll
come
in
a
second
said
miriam
adjusting
hairpins
she
was
to
read
goethe
with
fraulein
pfaff
fraulein
knew
she
would
be
one
of
the
few
who
would
do
for
a
goethe
reading
she
reached
the
little
room
smiling
with
happiness
here
she
is
was
fraulein
s
greeting
the
little
group
ulrica
minna
and
solomon
martin
were
sitting
about
informally
in
the
sunlit
window
space
minna
and
solomon
had
needlework
ulrica
was
gazing
out
into
the
garden
miriam
sank
into
the
remaining
wicker
chair
and
gave
herself
up
fraulein
began
to
read
as
she
did
at
prayers
slowly
almost
below
her
breath
but
so
clearly
that
miriam
could
distinguish
each
word
and
her
face
shone
as
she
bent
over
her
book
it
was
a
poem
in
blank
verse
with
long
undulating
lines
miriam
paid
no
heed
to
the
sense
she
heard
nothing
but
the
even
swing
the
slight
rising
and
falling
of
the
clear
low
tones
she
felt
once
more
the
opening
of
the
schoolroom
window
she
saw
the
little
brown
and
the
sun
shining
on
the
woodwork
of
its
porch
summer
coming
summer
coming
in
germany
she
drew
a
long
breath
the
poem
was
telling
of
someone
getting
away
out
of
a
room
out
of
narrow
conversation
to
a
plain
of
a
white
pathway
winding
through
the
green
minna
put
down
her
sewing
and
turned
her
kind
blue
eyes
to
fraulein
pfaff
s
face
ulrica
sat
drooping
her
head
bent
her
great
eyes
veiled
her
hands
entwined
on
her
lap
the
little
pathway
led
to
a
wood
the
wide
landscape
disappeared
fraulein
s
voice
ceased
she
handed
the
book
to
ulrica
indicating
the
place
and
ulrica
read
her
voice
sounded
a
higher
pitch
than
fraulein
s
it
sounded
out
rich
and
full
and
liquid
and
seemed
to
shake
her
slight
body
and
echo
against
the
walls
of
her
face
it
filled
the
room
with
a
despairing
ululation
fraulein
seemed
by
contrast
to
have
been
whispering
piously
in
a
corner
listening
to
the
beseeching
tones
hearing
no
words
miriam
wished
that
the
eyes
could
be
raised
when
the
reading
ceased
to
hers
and
that
she
could
go
and
put
her
hands
about
the
beautiful
head
scarcely
touching
it
and
say
it
is
all
right
i
will
stay
with
you
she
watched
the
little
hand
that
was
not
engaged
with
the
book
and
lay
abandoned
outstretched
listless
and
shining
on
her
knee
solomon
s
needle
snapped
she
frowned
and
roused
herself
heavily
to
secure
another
from
the
basket
on
the
floor
at
her
side
miriam
flashing
hatred
at
her
caught
fraulein
s
fascinating
gaze
fixed
on
ulrica
and
saw
it
hastily
turn
to
an
indulgent
smile
as
the
eyes
became
conscious
moving
for
a
moment
without
reaching
her
in
the
direction
of
her
own
low
chair
a
tap
came
at
the
door
and
anna
s
flat
tones
like
a
voluble
mechanical
doll
announced
a
postal
official
waiting
in
the
hall
for
ulrica
with
a
package
ein
packet
wailed
ulrica
rising
her
hands
trembling
her
great
eyes
radiant
fraulein
sent
her
off
with
solomon
to
superintend
the
signing
and
payments
and
give
help
with
the
unpacking
the
little
heiress
she
said
devoutly
with
her
wide
smile
as
she
returned
from
the
door
oh
said
miriam
politely
sie
nun
miss
henderson
concluded
fraulein
handing
her
the
book
and
indicating
the
passage
ulrica
had
just
read
nun
sie
she
repeated
brightly
and
minna
drew
her
chair
a
little
nearer
making
a
small
group
schiller
she
saw
at
the
top
of
the
page
and
the
title
of
the
poem
der
miriam
laid
the
book
on
the
end
of
her
knee
and
leaning
over
it
read
nervously
her
tones
reassured
her
she
noticed
that
she
read
very
slowly
breaking
up
the
rhythm
into
sentences
and
authoritatively
as
if
she
were
recounting
an
experience
of
her
own
she
knew
at
first
that
she
was
reading
like
a
cultured
person
and
that
fraulein
would
recognise
this
at
once
she
knew
that
the
perfect
assurance
of
her
pronunciation
would
make
it
seem
that
she
understood
every
word
but
soon
these
feelings
gave
way
to
the
sense
half
grasped
of
the
serpentine
path
winding
and
mounting
through
a
wood
of
a
glimpse
of
a
distant
valley
of
flocks
and
villages
and
of
her
unity
with
fraulein
and
minna
seeing
and
feeling
all
these
things
together
she
finished
the
passage
fraulein
quietly
commended
her
reading
and
minna
said
something
about
her
earnestness
miss
henderson
is
always
a
little
earnest
said
fraulein
affectionately
are
you
dressed
hendy
miriam
who
had
sat
up
in
her
bath
when
the
drumming
came
at
the
door
answered
sleepily
no
i
shan
t
be
a
don
t
you
want
to
see
the
diving
all
jimmie
s
fingers
seemed
to
be
playing
exercises
against
the
panels
miriam
wished
she
would
restrain
them
and
leave
her
alone
she
did
not
in
the
least
wish
to
see
the
diving
i
shan
t
be
a
minute
she
shouted
crossly
and
let
her
shoulders
sink
once
more
under
the
comforting
water
it
was
the
first
warm
water
she
had
encountered
since
that
night
when
mademoiselle
had
carried
the
jugs
upstairs
her
soap
so
characterless
in
the
chilly
morning
basin
lathered
freely
in
the
warmth
and
was
fragrant
in
the
steamy
air
when
jimmie
s
knocking
came
she
was
dreaming
blissfully
of
baths
with
harriett
the
dissipated
baths
of
the
last
six
months
between
tea
and
dinner
with
a
theatre
or
a
dance
ahead
harriett
her
hair
strained
tightly
into
a
white
crocheted
net
her
snub
face
shining
through
the
thick
steam
tubbing
and
jesting
at
the
wide
end
of
the
huge
porcelain
bath
herself
at
the
narrow
end
commanding
the
taps
under
the
beams
of
the
gasjets
and
those
wonderful
summer
bathings
when
they
had
come
in
from
long
in
the
sun
filled
the
bath
with
cold
water
and
sat
in
the
silence
of
broad
daylight
immersed
to
the
neck
confronting
each
other
seeing
no
sign
of
anything
she
could
recognise
as
a
towel
she
pulled
at
a
huge
drapery
hanging
like
a
counterpane
in
front
of
a
coil
of
pipes
extending
to
the
ceiling
the
pipes
were
too
hot
to
touch
and
the
heavy
drapery
was
more
than
warm
and
obviously
meant
for
drying
purposes
sitting
wrapped
in
its
folds
dizzy
and
oppressed
she
longed
for
the
flourish
of
a
rough
towel
and
a
window
open
at
the
top
she
could
see
no
ventilation
of
any
kind
in
her
white
cell
by
the
time
her
heavy
outdoor
things
were
on
she
was
faint
with
exhaustion
and
hurried
down
the
corridor
towards
the
shouts
and
splashings
echoing
in
the
great
open
she
was
just
in
time
to
see
a
figure
in
scarlet
and
white
standing
out
on
the
high
gallery
at
the
end
of
a
projecting
board
which
broke
the
little
white
balustrade
throw
up
its
arms
and
leap
out
and
flash
its
joined
hands
pointed
downwards
towards
the
water
its
white
feet
sweeping
up
like
the
tail
of
a
swooping
bird
cleave
the
green
water
and
disappear
the
huge
bath
was
empty
of
bathers
and
smoothly
rippling
save
where
the
flying
body
had
cleaved
it
and
left
wavelets
and
bubbles
the
girls
most
of
them
in
their
outdoor
things
were
gathered
in
a
little
group
near
the
marble
steps
leading
down
into
the
water
farthest
from
where
the
diver
had
dropped
stirring
and
exclaiming
as
miriam
was
approaching
them
a
head
came
cleanly
up
out
of
the
water
near
the
steps
and
she
recognised
the
strong
jaw
and
gleaming
teeth
of
gertrude
she
neither
spluttered
nor
shook
her
head
her
eyes
were
wide
and
smiling
and
her
raucous
laugh
rang
out
above
the
applause
of
the
group
of
girls
miriam
paused
under
the
overhanging
gallery
her
eyes
went
incredulously
up
to
the
it
seemed
impossible
and
all
that
distance
above
the
water
her
gaze
was
drawn
to
the
flicking
of
the
curtain
of
one
of
the
little
compartments
lining
the
gallery
hullo
hendy
let
me
get
into
my
gertrude
stood
before
her
dripping
and
smiling
however
on
earth
did
you
do
it
said
miriam
gazing
incredulously
at
the
ruddy
wet
face
gertrude
s
smile
broadened
go
on
she
said
shaking
the
drops
from
her
chin
it
s
all
in
the
day
s
in
the
hard
clear
light
miriam
saw
that
the
teeth
that
looked
so
gleaming
and
strong
in
the
distance
were
slightly
ribbed
and
fluted
and
had
serrated
edges
large
stoppings
showed
like
shadows
behind
the
thin
shells
of
the
upper
front
ones
even
gertrude
might
be
ill
one
day
but
she
would
never
be
ill
and
sad
and
helpless
that
was
clear
from
the
neat
way
she
plunged
in
through
her
curtains
miriam
s
eyes
went
back
to
the
row
of
little
curtained
recesses
in
the
gallery
the
drapery
that
had
flapped
was
now
half
withdrawn
the
light
from
the
glass
roof
fell
upon
the
top
of
a
head
flung
back
and
shaking
its
mane
of
hair
the
profile
was
invisible
but
the
sheeny
hair
rippled
in
thick
gilded
waves
almost
to
the
floor
how
hateful
of
her
thought
miriam
how
beautiful
i
should
be
just
the
same
if
i
had
hair
like
that
that
s
germany
lohengrin
she
stood
adoring
stay
and
talk
while
i
get
on
my
togs
came
gertrude
s
voice
from
behind
her
curtains
miriam
glanced
towards
the
marble
steps
the
little
group
had
disappeared
she
turned
helplessly
towards
gertrude
s
curtains
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
to
her
she
was
filled
with
apprehension
i
wonder
what
we
shall
do
she
presently
murmured
i
don

gasped
gertrude
towelling
miriam
waited
for
the
prophecy
old
lahmann
s
back
from
geneva
came
the
harsh
panting
voice
pastor

repeated
miriam
none

on
miriam
dimly
wishing
that
she
might
be
released

i
saw

s
the
billows
of
gold
hair
in
the
gallery
were
being
piled
up
by
two
little
hands
white
and
plump
like
eve
s
but
with
quick
clever
irritating
movements
and
a
thin
sweet
voice
began
singing
du

miriam
lost
interest
in
the
vision
they
were
all
the
same
men
liked
creatures
like
that
she
could

miriam

on

eagerly

her
consoling
tones

clara

kom
the
child
linked
arms
with
her
and
pulled
miriam
towards
the
corridor
once
out
of
sight
under
the
gallery
she
slipped
her
arm
round
miriam
s
waist
oh

darling

one

what

said
miriam
half
turning
as
the
girl
s
warm
lips
brushed
the
angle
of
her
jaw
yes
we
ll
go
home
come
the
corridor
was
almost
airless
she
longed
to
get
out
into
the
open
they
found
minna
at
a
table
in
the
entrance
hall
her
head
propped
on
her
hand
snoring
gently
clara
sat
near
her
with
closed
eyes
as
the
little
party
of
four
making
its
way
home
cleansed
and
hungry
united
and
happy
stood
for
a
moment
on
a
island
across
a
wide
open
space
minna
with
her
eager
smile
said
gazing
oh
i
would
like
a
glass
miriam
saw
very
distinctly
the
clear
sunlight
on
the
boles
of
the
trees
showing
every
ridge
and
shade
of
colour
as
it
had
done
on
the
peaked
porch
in
the
morning
the
girls
closed
in
on
her
during
the
moment
of
disgust
which
postponed
her
response
dear
hendchen
we
are
alone
just
we
nice
four
just
only
one
most
little
small
glass
just
one
kind
best
hendchen
she
heard
she
pushed
her
way
through
the
little
group
pretending
to
ignore
their
pleadings
and
to
look
for
obstacles
to
their
passage
to
the
opposite
curb
she
felt
her
disgust
was
absurd
and
was
asking
herself
why
the
girls
should
not
have
their
beer
she
would
like
to
watch
them
she
knew
these
little
german
serenely
happy
at
their
bier
table
on
this
bright
afternoon
they
closed
in
on
her
again
emma
in
the
gutter
in
front
of
her
she
felt
arms
and
hands
and
the
pleading
voices
besieged
her
again
emma
s
upturned
tragic
face
her
usually
motionless
lips
a
beseeching
tunnel
her
chin
and
throat
moving
to
her
ardent
words
made
miriam
laugh
it
disgusting
no
no
she
said
hastily
backing
away
from
them
to
the
end
of
the
island
of
course
not
come
along
don
t
be
the
elder
girls
gave
in
emma
kept
up
a
little
solo
of
reproach
hanging
on
miriam
s
arm
very
strict
cold
english
no
bier
i
want
to
home
i
have
bier
to
home
until
they
were
in
sight
of
the
high
walls
of
waldstrasse
pastor
lahmann
gave
a
french
lesson
the
next
afternoon
sur
l
eau
si
beau
this
refrain
threatening
for
the
third
time
three
or
four
of
the
girls
led
by
bertha
martin
supplied
it
in
a
subdued
singsong
without
waiting
for
pastor
lahmann
s
slow
voice
miriam
had
scarcely
attended
to
his
discourse
he
had
begun
in
flat
easy
tones
describing
his
visit
to
geneva
the
snowclad
mountains
the
quiet
lake
the
spring
flowers
his
words
brought
her
no
vision
and
her
mind
wandered
half
tethered
but
when
he
began
reading
the
poem
she
sank
into
the
rhythm
and
turned
towards
him
and
fixed
expectant
eyes
upon
his
face
his
expression
disturbed
her
why
did
he
read
with
that
she
felt
sure
that
he
felt
they
were
young
ladies
demoiselles
jeunes
she
wanted
to
tell
him
she
was
nothing
of
the
kind
and
take
the
book
from
him
and
show
him
how
to
read
his
eyes
soft
and
brown
were
the
eyes
of
a
child
she
noticed
that
the
lower
portion
of
his
flat
white
cheeks
looked
broader
than
the
upper
without
giving
an
effect
of
squareness
of
jaw
then
the
rhythm
took
her
again
and
with
the
second
sur
l
eau
si
beau
she
saw
a
very
blue
lake
and
a
little
boat
with
lateen
sails
and
during
the
third
verse
began
to
forget
the
lifeless
voice
as
the
murmured
refrain
came
from
the
girls
there
was
a
slight
movement
in
fraulein
s
miriam
did
not
turn
her
eyes
from
pastor
lahmann
s
face
to
look
at
her
but
half
expected
that
at
the
end
of
the
next
verse
her
low
clear
devout
tones
would
be
heard
joining
in
part
way
through
the
verse
with
a
startling
sweep
of
draperies
against
the
leather
covering
of
the
sofa
fraulein
stood
up
and
towered
extraordinarily
tall
at
pastor
lahmann
s
right
hand
her
eyes
were
wide
miriam
thought
she
had
never
seen
anyone
look
so
pale
she
was
speaking
very
quickly
in
german
pastor
lahmann
rose
and
faced
her
miriam
had
just
grasped
the
fact
that
she
was
taking
the
french
master
to
task
for
reading
poetry
to
his
pupils
and
heard
pastor
lahmann
slowly
and
politely
enquire
of
her
whether
she
or
he
were
conducting
the
lesson
when
the
two
voices
broke
out
together
fraulein
s
fiercely
voluble
and
the
herr
pastor
s
voluble
and
mocking
and
polite
the
two
voices
continued
as
he
made
his
way
bowing
gravely
down
the
far
side
of
the
table
to
the
saal
doors
here
he
turned
for
a
moment
and
his
face
shone
black
and
white
against
the
dark
panelling
na
kinder
crooned
fraulein
gently
when
he
had
disappeared
a
walk
a
walk
in
the
beautiful
sunshine
make
ready
my
sainted
uncle
laughed
bertha
as
they
trooped
down
the
basement
stairs
oh
my
stars
you
see
her
eyes
ja
wuthend
i
wonder
the
poor
little
man
wasn
t
burnt
hurry
up
madshuns
we
ll
have
a
ripping
walk
we
ll
see
if
we
can
go
does
this
sort
of
thing
often
happen
asked
miriam
finding
herself
bending
over
a
at
gertrude
s
side
gertrude
turned
and
winked
at
her
only
what
an
awful
temper
she
must
have
pursued
miriam
gertrude
laughed
breakfast
the
next
morning
was
a
gay
feast
the
mood
which
had
seized
the
girls
at
the
lavishly
decked
awaiting
them
on
their
return
from
their
momentous
walk
the
day
before
still
held
them
they
all
had
come
in
feeling
a
little
apprehensive
and
fraulein
behind
her
had
met
them
with
the
fullest
expansion
of
smiling
indulgence
miriam
had
yet
seen
after
tea
she
had
suggested
an
evening
s
entertainment
and
had
permitted
the
english
girls
to
act
charades
for
miriam
it
was
an
evening
of
pure
delight
at
the
end
of
the
first
charade
when
the
girls
were
standing
at
a
loss
in
the
hall
she
made
a
timid
suggestion
it
was
enthusiastically
welcomed
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
she
was
allowed
to
take
the
lead
she
found
herself
making
up
scene
after
scene
surrounded
by
eager
faces
she
wondered
whether
her
raised
voice
as
she
disposed
of
proffered
suggestions
no
that
wouldn
t
be
clear
is
the
thing
we
ve
got
to
bring
out
could
be
heard
by
fraulein
sitting
waiting
with
the
germans
under
the
lowered
lights
in
the
saal
and
she
felt
fraulein
s
eye
on
her
as
she
plunged
from
the
hall
into
the
dim
schoolroom
rapidly
arranging
effects
in
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
long
table
which
had
been
turned
round
and
pushed
alongside
the
windows
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
dreaming
alone
in
the
schoolroom
near
the
closed
door
of
the
little
room
whence
the
scenes
were
lit
she
felt
herself
in
a
vast
space
the
ceilings
and
walls
seemed
to
disappear
she
wanted
a
big
scene
something
quiet
and
serious
quite
different
from
the
fussy
little
absurdities
they
had
been
rushing
through
all
the
evening
a
statue
one
of
the
germans
you
think
of
something
this
time
she
said
pushing
the
group
of
girls
out
into
the
hall
ulrica
she
must
manage
to
bring
in
ulrica
without
giving
her
anything
to
do
just
to
have
her
to
look
at
the
height
of
darkened
room
above
her
rose
to
a
sky
an
animated
discussion
led
by
bertha
martin
was
going
on
in
the
hall
they
had
chosen
it
would
be
a
catch
fraulein
was
always
calling
them
her
bienenkorb
and
the
girls
would
guess
bienenkorb
and
not
discover
that
they
were
meant
to
say
the
english
word
the
old
things
can
t
possibly
get
it
it
ll
be
a
lark
just
for
the
end
said
jimmie
miriam
announced
radiantly
they
d
hate
a
sell
we
ll
have
that
ll
be
awfully
long
four
bits
altogether
if
they
don
t
guess
from
the
syllables
objected
solomon
wearily
rapidly
planning
farcical
scenes
for
the
syllables
she
carried
her
tired
troupe
to
a
vague
appreciation
of
the
final
tableau
for
ulrica
shrouding
the
last
syllable
beyond
recognition
she
sent
a
messenger
to
the
audience
through
the
hall
door
of
the
saal
to
beg
for
ulrica
ulrica
came
serenely
wondering
her
great
eyes
alight
with
her
evening
s
enjoyment
and
was
induced
by
miriam
you
ve
only
to
stand
and
look
to
mount
the
schoolroom
table
in
the
dimness
and
standing
with
her
hands
on
the
back
of
a
draped
chair
to
gaze
down
at
romeo
s
upturned
face
bertha
martin
s
pale
profile
with
her
fair
hair
drawn
back
and
tied
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
a
loose
cloak
round
her
shoulders
would
it
was
agreed
make
the
best
presentation
of
a
youth
they
could
contrive
and
miriam
arranged
her
turning
her
upturned
face
so
that
the
audience
would
catch
its
clear
outline
but
at
the
last
minute
urged
by
solomon
s
disapproval
of
the
scene
bertha
withdrew
miriam
put
on
the
cloak
lifted
its
collar
to
hide
her
hair
and
standing
with
her
back
to
the
audience
flung
up
her
hands
towards
ulrica
as
the
gas
behind
the
little
schoolroom
door
was
turned
slowly
up
standing
motionless
gazing
at
the
pale
oval
face
bending
gravely
towards
her
from
the
gloom
she
felt
for
a
moment
the
radiance
of
stars
above
her
and
heard
the
rustle
of
leaves
then
the
guessing
voices
broke
from
the
saal
ach
ach
wie
schon
romeo
that
is
beautifoll
romeo
who
is
our
romeo
and
fraulein
s
smiling
singing
affectionate
voice
who
is
romeo
the
rascal
taking
the
top
flight
three
stairs
at
a
time
miriam
reached
the
garret
first
and
began
running
about
the
room
at
a
quick
trot
with
her
fists
closed
arms
doubled
and
elbows
back
the
high
garret
looked
wonderfully
friendly
and
warm
in
the
light
of
her
single
candle
it
seemed
full
of
approving
voices
perhaps
one
day
she
would
go
on
the
stage
eve
always
said
so
people
always
liked
her
if
she
let
herself
go
she
would
let
herself
go
more
in
future
at
waldstrasse
it
was
so
jolly
being
at
waldstrasse
qu
que
vous
avez
appealed
mademoiselle
laughing
at
the
door
with
open
face
miriam
continued
her
trot
mademoiselle
put
the
candle
down
on
the
and
began
to
run
too
in
little
quick
dancing
steps
her
wincey
skirt
bellowing
out
all
round
her
their
shadows
bobbed
and
darted
swelling
and
shrinking
on
the
plaster
walls
soon
breathless
mademoiselle
sank
down
on
the
side
of
her
bed
panting
and
volleying
raillery
and
broken
tinkles
of
laughter
at
miriam
standing
goosestepping
on
the
strip
of
matting
with
an
open
umbrella
held
high
over
her
head
recovering
breath
she
began
to
lament
miriam
had
not
during
the
whole
evening
of
dressing
up
seen
the
martins
summer
hats
they
were
wonderful
shutting
her
umbrella
miriam
went
to
her
drawer
it
would
be
impossible
absolutely
impossible
to
imagine
hats
more
beautiful
miriam
sat
on
her
own
bed
punctuating
through
a
comb
mademoiselle
persisted
non
ecoutez
the
hats
were
of
a
pale
straw
the
colour
of
pepper
bee
responded
the
comb
on
a
short
low
wheeze
and
the
trimmings
ah
of
a
charm
that
no
one
could
beem
squeaked
the
comb
stalks
of
barley
of
a
perfect
naturalness
and
the
flowers
poppies
of
a
beauty
beeem
oh
oh
vraiment
mademoiselle
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
and
put
her
fingers
to
her
ears
miriam
began
playing
very
softly
the
march
of
the
men
of
harlech
and
got
to
her
feet
and
went
marching
gently
round
the
room
near
the
walls
sitting
up
mademoiselle
listened
presently
she
rounded
her
eyes
and
pointed
with
one
finger
to
the
dim
roof
of
the
attic
les
toiles
d
araignees
auront
peur
she
whispered
miriam
ceased
playing
and
her
eyes
went
up
to
the
little
window
frames
high
in
the
wall
farthest
away
from
the
island
made
by
their
two
little
beds
and
the
matting
and
toilet
chests
and
scarcely
visible
in
the
flickering
and
came
back
to
mademoiselle
s
face
les
toiles
d
araignees
she
breathed
straining
her
eyes
to
their
utmost
size
they
gazed
at
each
other
les
toiles
mademoiselle
s
laughter
came
first
they
sat
holding
each
other
s
eyes
shaken
with
laughter
until
mademoiselle
said
sighing
brokenly
et
c
est
la
cloche
qui
va
sonner
as
they
undressed
she
went
on
talking
the
night
comes
the
black
night
we
must
sleep
we
must
sleep
in
peace
we
are
safe
we
are
protected
nous
craignons
dieu
n
est
ce
pas
miriam
was
shocked
to
find
her
at
her
elbow
in
her
nightgown
speaking
very
gravely
she
looked
for
a
moment
into
the
serious
eyes
challenging
her
own
the
mouth
was
frugally
compressed
oh
yes
said
miriam
stiffly
they
blew
out
the
candle
when
the
bell
sounded
and
got
into
bed
miriam
imagined
the
martins
regular
features
under
their
barley
and
poppy
trimmed
hats
she
knew
exactly
the
kind
of
english
hat
it
would
be
they
were
certainly
not
pretty
hats
she
wondered
at
mademoiselle
s
french
eyes
being
so
impressed
she
knew
they
must
be
hats
with
very
narrow
brims
the
trimming
coming
nearly
to
the
edge
and
solomon
s
she
felt
sure
inclined
to
be
mademoiselle
was
talking
about
translated
english
books
she
had
read
miriam
was
glad
of
her
thin
voice
piercing
the
darkness
she
did
not
want
to
sleep
she
loved
the
day
that
had
gone
and
the
one
that
was
coming
she
saw
the
room
again
as
it
had
been
when
mademoiselle
had
looked
up
towards
the
toiles
d
araignees
she
had
never
thought
of
there
being
cobwebs
up
there
now
she
saw
them
dangling
in
corners
high
up
near
those
mysterious
windows
unnoticed
looking
down
on
her
and
mademoiselle
fraulein
pfaff
s
cobwebs
they
were
hers
now
had
been
hers
through
cold
dark
nights
mademoiselle
was
asking
her
if
she
knew
a
most
charming
english
book
la
premiere
priere
de
jessica
oh
oh
the
most
beautiful
book
it
would
be
possible
to
an
indrawn
breath
le
secret
de
lady
yes
responded
miriam
sleepily
after
the
gay
breakfast
miriam
found
herself
alone
in
the
schoolroom
listening
inadvertently
to
a
conversation
going
on
apparently
in
fraulein
pfaff
s
room
beyond
the
little
schoolroom
the
voices
were
low
but
she
knew
neither
of
them
nor
could
she
distinguish
words
the
sound
of
the
voices
boxed
in
filling
a
little
space
shut
off
from
the
great
empty
hall
made
the
house
seem
very
still
the
saal
was
empty
the
girls
were
upstairs
at
their
housework
miriam
restlessly
rising
early
had
done
her
share
before
breakfast
she
took
harriett
s
last
letter
from
her
pocket
and
fumbled
the
disarranged
leaves
for
the
conclusion
we
are
sending
you
out
two
blouses
don
t
you
think
you
re
lucky
miriam
glanced
out
at
the
young
chestnut
leaves
drooping
in
tight
pleats
from
black
twigs
real
grand
proper
blouses
the
first
you
ve
ever
had
and
a
skirt
to
wear
them
with
won
t
you
be
within
an
inch
of
your
life
mother
got
them
at
grigg
s
one
is
squashed
strawberry
with
a
sort
of
little
design
in
black
going
over
it
but
not
too
much
awfully
smart
and
the
other
is
a
sort
of
buffy
one
zephyr
the
other
cotton
and
the
skirt
is
a
sort
of
mixey
pepper
and
salt
with
lumps
in
the
weaving
you
know
how
i
mean
something
like
our
prawn
dresses
only
lighter
and
much
more
refined
the
duffer
is
going
to
join
the
he
was
at
the
pooles
dance
i
was
simply
flabbergasted
he
s
a
the
little
german
garden
was
disappearing
from
miriam
s
eyes
it
was
cruel
cruel
that
she
was
not
going
to
wear
her
blouses
at
home
at
the
with
harriett
it
was
all
beginning
again
after
all
the
spring
and
tennis
and
presently
boating
things
were
going
on
the
smash
had
not
come
why
had
she
not
stayed
just
one
more
spring
how
silly
and
hurried
she
had
been
and
there
at
home
in
the
garden
lilac
was
quietly
coming
out
and
syringa
and
guelder
roses
and
may
and
laburnum
and
everything
and
she
had
run
away
proud
of
herself
despising
them
all
and
had
turned
herself
into
miss
henderson
and
no
one
would
ever
know
who
she
was
perhaps
the
blouses
would
make
a
difference
it
must
be
extraordinary
to
have
blouses
slommucky
untidy
and
slommucky
lilla
s
mother
had
called
them
and
perhaps
they
would
not
fit
her
one
of
the
voices
rose
to
a
sawing
like
the
shrill
whir
of
wood
being
cut
by
machinery
a
derisive
laugh
broke
into
the
strange
sound
it
was
fraulein
pfaff
s
laughter
and
was
followed
by
her
voice
thinner
and
shriller
and
higher
than
the
other
miriam
listened
what
could
be
going
on
both
voices
were
almost
screaming
together
one
against
the
other
it
was
like
mad
women
a
door
broke
open
on
a
shriek
miriam
bounded
to
the
schoolroom
door
and
opened
it
in
time
to
see
anna
lurch
shouting
and
screaming
part
way
down
the
basement
stairs
she
turned
leaning
with
her
back
against
the
wall
her
eyes
sawing
with
fists
in
the
direction
of
fraulein
who
stood
laughing
in
her
doorway
after
one
glance
miriam
recoiled
they
had
not
seen
her
ja
screamed
fraulein
sie
konnen
ihre
paar
groschen
haben
ihre
paar
groschen
ihre
paar
groschen
and
then
the
two
voices
shrieked
incoherently
together
until
fraulein
s
door
slammed
to
and
anna
s
voice
shouting
and
swearing
died
away
towards
the
basement
miriam
had
crept
back
to
the
schoolroom
window
she
stood
shivering
trying
to
forget
the
taunting
words
and
the
cruel
laughter
you
can
have
your
ha
pence
poor
anna
her
poor
wages
her
bony
face
gertrude
looked
in
i
say
henderson
come
on
down
and
help
me
pack
up
lunch
we
re
all
going
to
hoddenheim
for
the
day
the
whole
family
come
for
the
day
the
day
ja
lily
s
miriam
stood
looking
at
her
laughing
face
and
listening
to
her
hoarse
whispering
voice
gertrude
turned
and
went
downstairs
miriam
followed
her
cold
and
sick
and
shivering
and
presently
glad
to
be
her
assistant
as
she
bustled
about
the
empty
kitchen
upstairs
the
other
girls
were
getting
ready
for
the
outing
starting
out
along
the
dusty
roadway
leading
from
the
railway
station
to
the
little
town
of
hoddenheim
through
the
hot
sunshine
miriam
was
already
weary
and
fearful
of
the
hours
that
lay
ahead
they
would
bring
tests
and
opportunities
for
fraulein
to
see
all
her
incapability
fraulein
had
thrown
her
thick
gauze
veil
back
over
her
large
hat
and
was
walking
with
short
footsteps
quickly
along
the
centre
of
the
roadway
throwing
out
exclamations
of
delight
calling
to
the
girls
in
a
singing
voice
to
cast
away
the
winter
to
fill
their
lungs
fill
their
hearts
with
spring
she
rallied
them
to
observation
miriam
could
not
remember
having
seen
men
working
in
fields
they
troubled
her
they
looked
up
with
strange
eyes
she
wished
they
were
not
there
she
wanted
the
fields
to
be
still
and
smaller
still
green
fields
and
orchards
woods
they
passed
a
farmyard
and
stopped
in
a
cluster
at
the
gate
there
was
a
moment
of
relief
for
her
here
she
could
look
easily
at
the
scatter
of
poultry
and
the
little
pigs
trotting
and
grunting
about
the
yard
she
talked
to
the
nearest
german
girl
of
these
and
of
the
calves
standing
in
the
shelter
of
a
rick
carefully
repeating
the
english
names
as
her
eyes
reached
the
rick
she
found
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
was
it
hay
or
straw
what
was
the
difference
she
dreaded
the
day
more
and
more
fraulein
passed
on
leading
the
way
down
the
road
with
emma
the
girls
straggled
after
her
making
some
remark
to
minna
miriam
secured
her
companionship
and
dropped
a
little
behind
the
group
minna
gave
her
one
eager
beam
from
behind
her
nose
which
was
shining
rosily
in
the
clear
air
and
they
walked
silently
along
side
by
side
bringing
up
the
rear
voices
and
the
scrabble
of
feet
along
the
roadway
sounded
ahead
miriam
noticed
large
rounded
puffs
of
white
cloud
standing
up
sharp
and
still
upon
the
horizon
cottages
began
to
appear
at
the
roadside
standing
and
moving
in
the
soft
air
was
the
strong
sour
smell
of
baking
schwarzbrot
a
big
woman
came
from
a
dark
cottage
and
stood
motionless
in
the
low
doorway
watching
them
with
kindly
body
miriam
glanced
at
her
face
her
eyes
were
small
and
expressionless
like
anna
s
presently
they
were
in
a
narrow
street
miriam
s
footsteps
hurried
she
almost
cried
aloud
the
facades
of
the
dwellings
passing
slowly
on
either
hand
were
higher
here
and
there
one
rose
to
a
high
peak
pierced
geometrically
with
tiny
windows
the
street
widening
out
ahead
showed
an
open
cobbled
space
and
at
every
angle
stood
high
quiet
peaked
houses
their
faces
shining
warm
cream
and
patterned
with
windows
they
overtook
the
others
drawn
up
in
the
roadway
before
a
long
low
wooden
house
miriam
had
time
to
see
little
gilded
figures
standing
out
in
niches
in
rows
all
along
the
facade
and
rows
of
scrollwork
dimly
painted
as
she
stood
still
a
moment
with
beating
heart
behind
the
group
she
heard
fraulein
talking
in
english
of
councillors
and
centuries
and
assumed
for
a
moment
as
fraulein
s
eye
passed
her
a
look
of
intelligence
then
they
had
all
moved
on
together
deeper
into
the
town
she
clung
to
minna
talking
at
random
did
she
like
hoddenheim
and
minna
responded
to
the
full
helping
her
talking
earnestly
and
emphatically
about
food
and
the
sunshine
isolating
the
two
of
them
and
they
all
reached
the
cobbled
open
space
and
stood
still
and
the
peaked
houses
stood
all
round
them
you
like
germany
miss
henderson
miriam
turned
a
radiant
face
to
fraulein
pfaff
s
table
and
made
some
movement
with
her
lips
i
think
you
have
something
of
the
german
in
she
has
she
has
said
minna
from
the
little
arbour
where
she
sat
with
millie
she
is
not
they
had
eaten
their
lunch
at
a
little
group
of
arboured
tables
at
the
back
of
an
old
wooden
inn
fraulein
had
talked
history
to
those
nearest
to
her
and
sat
back
at
last
with
her
gauze
veil
in
place
tall
and
still
in
her
arbour
sighing
happily
now
and
again
and
making
her
little
sounds
of
affectionate
raillery
as
the
girls
finished
their
coffee
and
jested
and
giggled
together
across
their
tables
you
have
beautiful
old
towns
and
villages
in
england
said
fraulein
yawning
slightly
yes
but
not
anything
like
oh
gertrude
that
isn
t
true
we
then
they
re
hidden
from
view
my
dear
mill
not
visible
to
the
naked
eye
laughed
gertrude
tell
us
my
millie
encouraged
fraulein
say
what
you
have
in
mind
perhaps
gairtrud
does
not
know
the
english
towns
and
villages
as
well
as
you
the
german
girls
attended
eagerly
i
can
t
tell
you
the
names
of
the
places
said
millie
but
i
have
seen
there
was
a
pause
gertrude
smiled
but
made
no
further
response
peectures
murmured
minna
peectures
always
are
beautiful
all
towns
are
beautiful
perhaps
not
there
may
he
bits
perhaps
blurted
miriam
but
not
whole
towns
and
nothing
anywhere
a
bit
like
hoddenheim
i
m
perfectly
oh
well
not
the
complained
millie
but
just
as
beautiful
more
of
course
there
are
bertha
there
must
well
millicent
pressed
fraulein
more
beautiful
and
why
beauty
is
what
you
see
and
is
not
for
everyone
the
same
it
is
an
de
so
you
must
tell
us
why
to
you
the
old
towns
of
england
are
more
beautiful
than
the
old
towns
of
germany
it
is
because
you
prefair
them
they
are
your
towns
it
is
quite
natural
you
should
prefair
it
isn
t
only
that
well
our
country
is
older
than
germany
besides
it
t
my
blessed
it
is
gertrude
our
oh

stirred
heavily
and
looked
up
flushing
her
eyes
avoiding
the
german
arbours
na
solemn
laughed
fraulein
pfaff
oh

of
course

a
queer
mixture
but

just
the
very
thing
that
makes
you
know
you
re
it
doesn
t
me
what
is
english
towns
looking
like
said
elsa
speier
no
one
seemed
ready
to
take
up
this
challenge
like
other
towns
i
suppose
laughed
jimmie
our
millie
is
glad
to
be
in
germany
ruled
fraulein
rising
she
and
i
agree
i
go
most
gladly
to
england
gairtrud

neither
english
nor
german
perhaps
she
looks
down
upon
us
of
course
i
do
roared
gertrude
crossing
her
knees
and
tilting
her
chair
what
do
you
think
was
denkt
ihr
i
am
a
a
still
we
of
the
wild
are
the
better
ah
we
end
then
with
a
quotation
from
our
dear
schiller
come
what
s
that
from
miriam
asked
of
gertrude
as
they
wandered
up
the
garden
the
magnificent
thing
play
we
saw
it
last
i
don
t
believe
she
really
cares
for
it
a
bit
was
miriam
s
mental
comment
her
heart
was
warm
towards
millie
looking
so
outlandish
with
her
english
vicarage
air
in
this
little
german
with
her
strange
love
of
germany
of
course
there
wasn
t
anything
a
bit
like
germany
in
england
so
silly
to
make
comparisons
comparisons
are
perfectly
true
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
street
through
a
long
low
roomful
of
men
drinking
at
little
tables
heavy
clouds
of
smoke
hung
and
moved
in
the
air
and
mingled
with
the
steady
odour
of
german
food
braten
onion
and
beer
and
rich
sour
bread
a
tinkling
melody
supported
by
rhythmic
bass
notes
that
seemed
to
thump
the
wooden
floor
came
from
a
large
musical
box
the
dark
rafters
ran
low
just
above
them
faces
glanced
towards
them
as
they
all
filed
avertedly
through
the
room
there
were
two
or
three
guttural
greetings
n
morgen
meine
damen
a
large
limber
woman
met
them
in
the
front
room
with
their
bill
and
stood
talking
to
fraulein
as
the
girls
straggled
out
into
the
sunshine
she
was
wearing
a
neat
check
dress
and
a
large
blue
apron
and
her
haggard
face
was
lit
with
radiantly
kind
strong
dark
eyes
miriam
envied
her
she
would
like
to
pour
out
beer
for
those
simple
men
and
dispense
their
food
quietly
and
busily
no
need
to
speak
to
them
or
be
clever
they
would
like
her
care
and
would
understand
meine
damen
hurt
her
she
was
not
dame
was
fraulein
elsa
millie
was
millie
would
condescend
to
these
men
without
feeling
uncomfortable
she
could
see
millie
at
village
teas
the
girls
looked
very
small
as
they
stood
in
groups
about
the
roadway
their
clothes
their
funny
confidence
being
so
sure
of
themselves
what
was
it
what
were
they
so
sure
of
there
was
nothing
and
she
was
afraid
of
them
all
even
of
minna
and
emma
sometimes
they
trailed
minna
once
more
safely
at
her
side
slowly
on
through
the
streets
of
the
peaked
and
gabled
carved
and
cobbled
town
it
came
nearer
to
her
than
barnes
nearer
even
than
the
old
first
house
she
had
kissed
the
morning
they
came
away
the
garden
the
river
the
woods
they
turned
aside
and
up
a
little
mounting
street
and
filed
into
a
churchyard
fraulein
tried
and
opened
the
great
carved
doorway
of
the
church
incense
they
were
going
into
a
roman
catholic
church
how
easy
it
was
just
to
walk
in
why
had
one
never
done
it
before
there
was
one
at
roehampton
but
it
would
be
different
in
england
pas
convenable
she
heard
mademoiselle
say
just
behind
her
non
je
connais
ces
je
vous
promets
vraiment
j
en
ai
peur
elsa
responded
with
excited
enquiries
they
all
trooped
quietly
in
and
the
great
doors
closed
behind
them
vraiment
j
ai
peur
whispered
mademoiselle
miriam
saw
a
point
of
red
light
shining
like
a
ruby
far
ahead
in
the
gloom
she
went
round
the
church
with
fraulein
pfaff
and
minna
and
was
shown
stations
and
chapels
altars
hung
with
offerings
a
dusty
madonna
an
alcove
railed
off
and
fitted
with
an
iron
chandelier
furnished
with
spikes
filled
up
its
height
by
a
solid
mass
of
waxen
drippings
banners
and
paintings
and
artificial
flowers
rich
dark
carvings
she
looked
at
everything
and
spoke
once
or
twice
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
a
roman
catholic
church
she
said
and
how
superstitious
when
they
came
upon
crutches
and
staves
hanging
behind
a
reredos
and
all
the
time
she
breathed
the
incense
and
felt
the
dimness
around
her
and
going
up
and
up
and
brooding
high
up
presently
they
were
joined
by
a
priest
he
took
them
into
a
little
room
unlocking
a
heavy
door
which
clanged
to
after
them
opening
out
behind
one
of
the
chapels
one
side
of
the
room
was
lined
with
an
oaken
cupboard
je
miriam
escaped
mademoiselle
s
neighbourhood
and
got
into
an
angle
between
the
frosted
window
and
the
plaster
wall
the
air
was
still
and
musty
the
floor
was
of
stone
the
ceiling
low
and
white
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
but
the
oaken
cupboard
the
priest
was
showing
a
cross
so
crusted
with
jewels
that
the
mounting
was
invisible
miriam
saw
it
as
he
lifted
it
from
its
wrappings
in
the
cupboard
it
seemed
familiar
to
her
she
did
not
wish
to
see
it
more
closely
to
touch
it
she
stood
as
thing
after
thing
was
taken
from
the
cupboard
waiting
in
her
corner
for
the
moment
when
they
must
leave
now
and
again
she
stepped
forward
and
appeared
to
look
smiled
and
murmured
faint
sounds
from
the
town
came
up
now
and
again
the
minutes
were
passing
soon
they
must
go
she
wanted
to
stay
more
than
she
had
ever
wanted
anything
in
her
life
she
wanted
to
stay
in
this
little
musty
room
behind
the
quiet
dim
church
in
this
little
town
at
sunset
they
stood
on
a
hill
outside
the
town
and
looked
across
at
it
lying
up
its
own
hillside
its
buildings
peaking
against
the
sky
they
counted
the
rich
green
copper
cupolas
and
sighed
and
exulted
over
the
whole
picture
the
coloured
sky
the
coloured
town
the
shimmering
of
the
trees
making
their
way
along
the
outskirts
of
the
town
towards
the
station
in
the
fading
light
they
met
a
little
troop
of
men
and
women
coming
quietly
along
the
roadway
they
were
all
dressed
in
black
they
looked
at
the
girls
with
strange
mild
eyes
and
filled
miriam
with
fear
presently
the
girls
crossed
a
little
high
bridge
over
a
stream
and
from
the
crest
of
the
bridge
beyond
a
garden
a
terraced
building
came
into
sight
it
was
dotted
with
women
dressed
in
black
one
of
the
figures
rose
and
waved
a
handkerchief
wave
children
said
fraulein
s
trembling
voice
wave
and
the
girls
collected
in
a
little
group
on
the
crest
of
the
bridge
and
waved
with
raised
arms
ghastly
isn
t
it
said
gertrude
glancing
at
miriam
as
they
moved
on
miriam
was
cold
with
apprehension
are
they
mad
she
whispered
for
a
week
the
whole
of
the
housework
and
cooking
was
done
by
the
girls
under
the
superintendence
of
gertrude
who
seemed
to
be
all
over
the
house
acting
as
forewoman
to
little
gangs
of
workers
miriam
took
but
a
small
part
in
the
work
minna
was
paying
long
visits
to
the
aurist
every
day
but
she
shared
the
depleted
table
and
knew
that
the
whole
school
was
taking
part
in
weathering
the
storm
of
fraulein
s
that
had
broken
first
upon
anna
she
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
gertrude
flushed
and
downcast
confronting
fraulein
s
reproachful
voice
upon
the
stairs
and
one
day
in
the
basement
she
heard
ulrica
tearfully
refuse
to
clean
her
own
boots
and
saw
fraulein
stand
before
her
bowing
and
smiling
and
with
the
girls
gathered
round
herself
brush
and
polish
the
slender
boots
she
was
glad
to
get
away
with
minna
her
blouses
came
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
she
carried
them
upstairs
her
hands
took
them
incredulously
from
their
wrappages
the
squashed
strawberry
lay
at
the
top
soft
warm
clear
covered
with
a
black
arabesque
of
tiny
leaves
and
tendrils
it
was
compactly
folded
showing
only
its
collar
shoulders
and
breast
she
laid
it
on
her
bed
side
by
side
with
its
buff
companion
and
shook
out
the
underlying
skirt
how
sweet
of
them
to
send
her
the
things
she
felt
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
stood
at
her
small
with
the
skirt
against
her
body
and
the
blouses
held
in
turn
above
it
they
both
went
perfectly
with
the
light
skirt
she
unfolded
them
and
shook
them
out
and
held
them
up
at
arms
length
by
the
shoulder
seams
her
heart
sank
they
were
not
in
the
least
like
anything
she
had
ever
worn
they
had
no
shape
they
were
square
and
the
sleeves
were
like
bags
she
turned
them
about
and
remembered
the
shapeliness
of
the
stockinette
jerseys
smocked
and
small
and
clinging
that
she
had
worn
at
school
if
these
were
blouses
then
she
would
never
be
able
to
wear
blouses
they
re
so
flountery
she
said
frowning
at
them
she
tried
on
the
one
it
startled
her
with
its
brightness
it
s
no
good
it
s
no
good
she
said
as
her
hands
fumbled
for
the
fastenings
there
was
a
hook
at
the
neck
that
was
all
frightful
she
fastened
it
and
the
collar
set
in
a
soft
roll
but
came
down
in
front
to
the
base
of
her
neck
the
rest
of
the
blouse
stuck
out
all
round
her
it
s
got
no
cut
they
couldn
t
have
looked
at
she
turned
helplessly
about
using
her
frowning
and
despairing
presently
she
saw
harriett
s
quizzical
eyes
and
laughed
woefully
tweaking
at
the
outstanding
margin
of
the
material
it
s
all
very
well
she
murmured
angrily
but
it
s
all
i
ve
she
wished
sarah
were
there
sarah
would
do
something
alter
it
or
something
she
heard
her
encouraging
voice
saying
you
haven
t
half
got
it
on
yet
it
ll
be
all
she
unfastened
her
black
skirt
crammed
the
flapping
margin
within
its
band
and
put
on
the
beaded
black
stuff
belt
the
blouse
bulged
back
and
front
shapelessly
and
seemed
to
be
one
with
the
shapeless
sleeves
which
ended
in
hard
loose
bands
riding
untrimmed
about
her
wrists
with
the
movements
of
her
hands
it
s
like
a
nightdress
she
said
wrathfully
and
dragged
the
fulnesses
down
all
round
under
her
skirt
it
looked
better
so
in
front
but
as
she
turned
with
raised
it
came
riding
up
at
the
side
and
back
with
the
movement
of
her
arm
minna
was
calling
to
her
from
the
stairs
she
went
on
to
the
landing
to
answer
her
and
found
her
on
the
top
flight
dressed
to
go
out
ach
she
whispered
as
miriam
drew
back
jetzt
mag
ich
sie
leiden
i
like
she
ran
back
to
her
room
there
was
no
time
to
change
she
fixed
a
brooch
in
the
collar
to
make
it
come
a
little
higher
at
the
join
going
downstairs
she
saw
pastor
lahmann
hanging
up
his
hat
in
the
hall
his
childish
eyes
came
up
as
her
step
sounded
on
the
lower
flight
miriam
was
amazed
to
see
him
standing
there
as
though
nothing
had
happened
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
smiling
at
him
until
his
face
lit
up
with
an
answering
smile
bonjour
miriam
did
not
answer
and
he
disappeared
into
the
saal
she
went
on
downstairs
listening
to
his
voice
repeating
his
words
over
and
over
in
her
mind
jimmie
was
sweeping
the
basement
floor
with
a
duster
tied
round
her
hair
hullo
mother
bunch
she
laughed
it
weird
isn
t
it
not
a
bit
the
kind
i
meant
to
the
blouse
is
all
right
my
dear
but
it
s
all
round
your
ears
and
you
ve
got
all
the
fulness
in
the
wrong
place
there
bless
the
woman
you
ve
got
no
drawstring
and
you
must
pin
it
at
the
back
and
haven
t
you
got
a
proper
leather
belt
minna
and
miriam
ambled
gently
along
together
miriam
had
discarded
her
little
fur
pelerine
and
her
jacket
bulged
loosely
over
the
thin
fabric
of
her
blouse
she
breathed
in
the
air
and
felt
it
playing
over
her
breast
and
neck
she
drew
deep
breaths
as
they
went
slowly
along
under
the
waldstrasse
and
looked
up
again
and
again
at
the
leaves
brilliant
opaque
green
against
white
plaster
with
sharp
black
shadows
behind
them
or
brilliant
transparent
green
on
the
hard
blue
sky
she
felt
that
the
scent
of
them
must
be
visible
every
breath
she
drew
was
like
a
long
yawning
sigh
she
felt
the
easy
expansion
of
her
body
under
her
heavy
jacket
perhaps
i
won
t
have
any
more
fitted
bodices
she
mused
and
was
back
for
a
moment
in
the
stale
little
of
the
barnes
dressmaker
she
remembered
deeply
breathing
in
the
odour
of
fabrics
and
dust
and
dankness
and
cracking
her
newly
fitted
lining
at
the
pinholes
and
saying
it
is
too
tight
there
i
can
t
go
like
that
but
you
never
want
to
go
like
that
my
dear
child
old
miss
ottridge
had
laughed
readjusting
the
pins
just
breathe
in
your
ordinary
way
there
see
that
s
perhaps
lilla
s
mother
was
right
about
blouses
perhaps
they
were
she
remembered
phrases
she
had
heard
about
people
s
figures
falling
abroad
the
sprawl
that
would
come
early
to
her
as
she
was
so
old
and
worried
perhaps
that
was
why
one
had
to
wear
boned
bodices
and
never
breathe
in
gulps
of
air
like
this
it
was
as
if
all
the
worry
were
being
taken
out
of
her
temples
she
felt
her
eyes
grow
strong
and
clear
a
coolness
flowed
through
her
obstructed
only
where
she
felt
the
heavy
pad
of
hair
pinned
to
the
back
of
her
head
the
line
of
her
hat
the
hot
line
of
compression
round
her
waist
and
the
confinement
of
her
inflexible
boots
they
were
approaching
the
georgstrasse
with
its
width
and
its
shops
and
cafes
and
pedestrians
an
officer
in
pale
blue
prussian
uniform
passed
by
flashing
a
single
hard
preoccupied
glance
at
each
of
them
in
turn
his
eyes
seemed
to
miriam
like
opaque
blue
glass
she
could
not
remember
such
eyes
in
england
they
began
to
walk
more
quickly
miriam
listened
abstractedly
to
minna
s
anticipations
of
three
days
at
a
friend
s
house
when
she
would
visit
her
parents
at
the
end
of
the
week
minna
s
parents
her
home
on
the
outskirts
of
a
little
town
its
garden
their
little
carriage
the
spring
the
beautiful
country
seemed
unreal
and
her
efforts
to
respond
and
be
interested
felt
like
a
sort
of
treachery
to
her
present
bliss
everybody
even
docile
minna
always
seemed
to
want
to
talk
about
something
else
suddenly
she
was
aware
that
minna
was
asking
her
whether
if
it
was
decided
that
she
should
leave
school
at
the
end
of
the
term
she
miriam
would
come
and
live
with
her
miriam
beamed
incredulously
minna
with
her
eyes
on
the
pavement
and
hurrying
along
explained
that
she
was
alone
at
home
that
she
had
never
made
friends
her
mother
always
wanted
her
to
make
friends
but
she
could
not
that
her
parents
would
be
so
delighted
that
she
she
wanted
miriam
you
you
are
so
different
so
reasonable
i
could
live
with
minna
s
garden
her
secure
country
house
her
rich
parents
no
worries
nothing
particular
to
do
seemed
for
a
moment
to
miriam
the
solution
and
continuation
of
all
the
gay
day
there
would
be
the
rest
of
the
term
increasing
spring
and
summer
fraulein
divested
of
all
mystery
and
fear
and
then
freedom
with
minna
she
glanced
at
minna
the
cheerful
pink
face
and
the
pink
bulb
of
nose
came
round
to
her
and
in
an
excited
undertone
she
murmured
something
about
the
apotheker
i
should
love
to
come
simply
love
it
said
miriam
enthusiastically
feeling
that
she
would
not
entirely
give
up
the
idea
yet
she
would
not
shut
off
the
offered
refuge
it
would
be
a
plan
to
have
in
reserve
she
had
been
daunted
as
minna
murmured
by
a
picture
of
minna
and
herself
in
that
remote
garden
she
receiving
confidences
about
the
apotheker
no
one
else
there
the
waldstrasse
household
blotted
out
herself
and
minna
finding
pretexts
day
after
day
to
visit
the
chemist
s
in
the
little
town
miriam
almost
ran
home
from
seeing
minna
into
the
three
o
clock
train
dear
beautiful
beautiful
hanover
the
sunlight
blazed
from
the
streets
everything
shone
bright
confident
shops
happy
german
cafes
moved
quickly
by
as
she
fled
along
sympathetic
eyes
answered
hers
she
almost
laughed
once
or
twice
when
she
met
an
eye
and
thought
how
funny
she
must
look
tearing
along
with
her
long
thick
black
jacket
bumping
against
her
she
would
leave
it
off
and
go
out
in
a
blouse
and
her
long
black
lace
scarf
she
imagined
harriett
at
her
side
harriett
s
long
scarf
and
longed
to
do
the
crab
walk
for
a
moment
or
the
halfpenny
dip
she
did
them
in
her
mind
she
heard
the
sound
of
her
boot
soles
tapping
the
shining
pavement
as
she
hurried
along
she
would
write
a
short
note
to
her
mother
a
girl
about
my
own
age
with
very
wealthy
parents
who
wants
a
companion
and
enclose
a
note
for
eve
or
harriett
eve
imagine
me
in
pomerania
my
dear
and
tell
her
about
the
coffee
parties
and
the
skating
and
the
sleighing
and
minna
s
german
christmasses
she
saw
minna
s
departing
face
leaning
from
the
carriage
window
its
new
gay
boldness
i
shall
no
more
when
we
are
at
home
call
you
miss
when
she
got
back
to
waldstrasse
she
found
anna
s
successor
newly
arrived
cleaning
the
neglected
front
doorstep
her
lean
yellow
face
looked
a
vacant
response
to
miriam
s
enquiry
for
fraulein
pfaff
ist
fraulein
zu
hause
she
repeated
the
girl
shook
her
head
vaguely
how
quiet
the
house
seemed
the
girls
after
a
morning
spent
in
turning
out
the
kitchen
for
the
reception
of
the
new
were
out
for
a
long
ramble
including
mit
until
the
empty
house
spread
round
her
and
towered
above
her
as
she
took
off
her
things
in
the
basement
and
the
schoolroom
yawned
bright
and
empty
as
she
reached
the
upper
hall
she
hesitated
by
the
door
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
she
would
play
on
the
saal
piano
i
m
not
a
lehrerin
i
m
not

hummed
as
she
collected
her
music
she
would
bring
her
songs
too
i
m
going
to

erain
eeya
she
hummed
swinging
herself
round
the
great
door
into
the
saal
pastor
lahmann
was
standing
near
one
of
the
windows
the
rush
of
her
entry
carried
her
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
he
met
her
there
smiling
quietly
she
stared
easily
and
comfortably
up
into
his
great
mild
eyes
went
into
them
as
they
remained
quietly
and
gently
there
receiving
her
presently
he
said
in
a
soft
low
tone
you
are
vairy
happy
miriam
moved
her
eyes
from
his
face
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
into
the
little
sunlit
the
sense
of
the
outline
of
his
shoulders
and
his
comforting
black
mannishness
so
near
to
her
brought
her
almost
to
tears
fiercely
she
fixed
the
sunlit
oh
i
m
she
said
not
is
it
possible
i
think
life
is
perfectly
she
moved
awkwardly
to
a
little
chiffonier
and
put
down
her
music
on
its
marble
top
he
came
safely
following
her
and
stood
near
again
you
do
not
like
the
life
of
the
school
oh
i
don
t
you
are
from
the
country
miriam
fumbled
with
her
music
was
she
one
sees
that
at
once
you
come
from
the
miriam
glanced
at
his
solid
white
profile
as
he
stood
with
hands
clasped
near
her
music
on
the
chiffonier
she
noticed
again
that
strange
flatness
of
the
lower
part
of
the
face
i
too
am
from
the
land
i
grew
up
on
a
farm
i
love
the
land
and
think
to
return
to
it
to
have
my
little
strip
when
i
am
free
when
my
boys
have
done
their
schooling
i
shall
go
he
turned
towards
her
and
miriam
smiled
into
the
soft
brown
eyes
and
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
my
grandfather
was
a
ah
that
does
not
surprise
me
but
what
a
very
english
expression
is
it
well
it
sounds
so
to
us
we
swiss
are
very
i
think
i
m
a
pastor
lahmann
lifted
his
chin
and
laughed
softly
you
are
a
vairy
ambitious
young
pastor

eagerly
listening
into
the
brown
eyes
that
came
round
to
meet
hers

little
wife
are
great
miriam
seemed
to
gaze
long
at
a
pallid
rounded
man
with
smiling
eyes
she
saw
a
garden
and
fields
a
firelit
interior
a
little
woman
smiling
and
busy
and
agreeable
moving
quickly
about
and
pastor
lahmann
presiding
it
filled
her
with
fury
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
a
world
of
little
tame
things
to
be
summoned
by
little
men
to
be
wives
she
must
make
him
see
that
she
did
not
even
recognise
such
a
thing
as
a
she
felt
her
gaze
growing
fixed
and
moved
to
withdraw
it
and
herself
why
do
you
wear
glasses
mademoiselle
the
voice
was
full
of
sympathetic
wistfulness
i
have
a
severe
myopic
astigmatism
she
announced
gathering
up
her
music
and
feeling
the
words
as
little
hammers
on
the
newly
seen
pallid
rounded
face
dear
me
i
wonder
whether
the
glasses
are
really
necessary
may
i
look
at
them
i
know
something
of
miriam
detached
her
tightly
fitting
and
having
given
them
up
stood
with
her
music
in
hand
anxiously
watching
half
her
vision
gone
with
her
glasses
she
saw
only
a
dim
knowledge
near
at
hand
going
perhaps
to
help
her
you
wear
them
always
for
how
long
poor
child
poor
child
and
you
must
have
passed
through
all
your
schooling
with
those
lame
lame
eyes
let
me
see
the
eyes
turn
a
little
to
the
light
standing
near
and

scrutinised
her
vague
gaze

smiling
voice
sounded
from
the
little
door
pastor
lahmann
stepped
back
miriam
was
pleased
at
the
thought
of
being
grouped
with
him
in
the
eyes
of
fraulein
pfaff
as
she
took
her
glasses
from
his
outstretched
hand
she
felt
that
fraulein
would
recognise
that
they
had
established
a
kind
of
friendliness
she
halted
for
a
moment
at
the
door
adjusting
her
glasses
amiably
uncertain
feeling
for
something
to
say
pastor
lahmann
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
examining
his
nails
fraulein
at
the
window
was
twitching
a
curtain
into
place
she
turned
and
drove
miriam
from
the
room
with
speechless
waiting
eyes
the
sunlight
was
streaming
across
the
hall
it
seemed
gay
and
pastor
lahmann
had
made
her
forget
she
was
a
governess
he
had
treated
her
as
a
girl
fraulein
s
eyes
had
spoiled
it
fraulein
was
angry
about
it
for
some
extraordinary
reason

miss
fraulein
pfaff
s
words
broke
the
silence
accompanying
the
servant
s
progress
from
gertrude
whose
she
had
first
seized
to
miriam
more
than
down
the
table
startled
into
observation
miriam
saw
the
of
her
neighbour
whisked
dripping
from
its
plate
to
the
uppermost
of
marie
s
pile
and
emma
shrinking
back
with
a
horrified
face
against
jimmie
who
was
leaning
forward
entranced
with
watching
the
whole
table
was
watching
marie
having
secured
emma
s
plate
to
the
base
of
her
pile
clutched
miriam
s
spoon
miriam
moved
sideways
as
the
spoon
swept
up
saw
the
desperate
hard
lean
face
bend
towards
her
for
a
moment
as
her
plate
was
seized
heard
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
from
fraulein
and
little
sounds
from
all
round
the
table
marie
had
passed
on
to
clara
clara
received
her
with
plate
and
spoon
held
firmly
together
and
motioned
her
before
she
would
relinquish
them
to
place
her
load
upon
the
shelf
of
the
lift
miriam
felt
she
was
in
disgrace
with
the
whole
table
she
sat
flaring
rapidly
framing
phrase
after
phrase
for
the
lips
of
her
judges
slow
and
awkward
never
has
her
wits
about
her
don

let
her
do
it
miss

why
should
fraulein
fix
upon
to
teach
her
common
servants
struggling
through
her
resentment
was
pride
in
the
fact
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
handle
presently
she
sat
refusing
absolutely
to
accept
the
judgment
silently
assailing
her
on
all
hands
you
are
not
very
domesticated
miss
no
responded
miriam
quietly
in
joy
and
fear
fraulein
gave
a
short
laugh
goaded
miriam
plunged
forward
we
were
never
even
allowed
in
the

at

brought
up
like

miriam

whole

was
on
fire
and
your

and
your

echoed
through
and
through
her
holding
back
her
tears
she
looked
full
at
fraulein
and
met
the
brown
eyes
she
met
them
until
they
turned
away
and
fraulein
broke
into
smiling
generalities
conversation
was
released
all
round
the
table
emphatic
undertones

her
from

simply
i

mused
miriam
calmly
on
the
declining
tide
of
her
wrath
pretending
to
be
occupied
with
those
about
her
she
sat
examining
the
look
fraulein

viii
walking
along
a
narrow
muddy
causeway
by
a
little
river
overhung
with
willows
girls
ahead
of
her
in
single
file
and
girls
in
single
file
behind
miriam
drearily
recognised
that
it
was
june
the
month
of
roses
she
thought
and
looked
out
across
the
flat
green
fields
it
was
not
easy
to
walk
along
the
slippery
pathway
on
one
side
was
the
little
grey
river
on
the
other
long
wet
grass
repelling
and
depressing
not
far
ahead
was
the
roadway
which
led
she
supposed
to
the
farm
where
they
were
to
drink
new
milk
she
would
have
to
walk
with
someone
when
they
came
to
the
road
and
talk
she
wondered
whether
this
early
morning
walk
would
come
now
every
day
her
heart
sank
at
the
thought
it
had
been
too
hot
during
the
last
few
days
for
any
going
out
at
midday
and
she
had
hoped
that
the
strolling
in
the
garden
sitting
about
under
the
chestnut
tree
and
in
the
little
wooden
garden
room
off
the
saal
had
taken
the
place
of
walks
for
the
summer
she
had
got
up
reluctantly
at
the
surprise
of
the
very
early
gonging
mademoiselle
had
guessed
it
would
be
a
pausing
in
the
bright
light
of
the
top
landing
as
mademoiselle
ran
downstairs
she
had
seen
through
the
landing
window
the
deep
peak
of
a
distant
gable
casting
an
unfamiliar
shadow
a
shadow
sloping
the
wrong
way
a
morning
shadow
she
remembered
the
first
time
the
only
time
she
had
noticed
such
a
shadow
getting
up
very
early
one
morning
while
harriett
and
all
the
household
were
still
asleep
and
how
she
had
stopped
dressing
and
gazed
at
it
as
it
stood
there
cool
and
quiet
and
alone
across
the
mellow
face
of
a
neighbouring
stone
porch
had
suddenly
been
glad
that
she
was
alone
and
had
wondered
why
that
shadowed
was
more
beautiful
than
all
the
summer
things
she
knew
and
felt
at
that
moment
that
nothing
could
touch
or
trouble
her
again
she
could
not
find
anything
of
that
feeling
in
the
early
day
outside
hanover
she
was
hemmed
in
and
the
fields
were
so
sad
she
could
not
bear
to
look
at
them
the
sun
had
disappeared
since
they
came
out
the
sky
was
grey
and
low
and
it
seemed
warmer
already
than
it
had
been
in
the
midday
sun
during
the
last
few
days
one
of
the
girls
on
ahead
hummed
the
refrain
of
a

miriam
felt
very
near
the
end
of
endurance
elsa
speier
who
was
just
behind
her
became
her
inevitable
companion
when
they
reached
the
roadway
a
farmhouse
appeared
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
miriam
s
sense
of
her
duties
closed
in
on
her
trying
not
to
see
elsa
s
elaborate
clothes
and
the
profile
in
which
she
could
find
no
meaning
no
hope
no
rest
she
spoke
to
her
do
you
like
milk
elsa
she
said
cheerfully
elsa
began
swinging
her
parasol
if
i
like
milk
she
repeated
presently
and
flashed
mocking
eyes
in
miriam
s
direction
despair
touched
miriam
s
heart
some
people
don
t
she
said
elsa
hummed
and
swung
her
parasol
why
should
i
like
milk
she
stated
the
muddy
farmyard
lying
back
from
the
roadway
and
below
it
was
steamy
and
choking
with
odours
miriam
who
had
imagined
a
cool
dairy
and
cold
milk
frothing
in
pans
felt
a
loathing
as
warmth
came
to
her
fingers
from
the
glass
she
held
most
of
the
girls
were
busily
sipping
she
raised
her
glass
once
towards
her
lips
snuffed
a
warm
reek
and
turned
away
towards
the
edge
of
the
group
to
pour
out
the
contents
of
her
glass
unseen
upon
the
earth
passing
languidly
up
through
the
house
after
breakfast
unable
to
decide
to
spend
her
saturday
morning
as
usual
at
a
piano
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
miriam
went
wondering
in
response
to
a
quiet
call
from
fraulein
pfaff
into
the
large
room
shared
by
the
bergmanns
and
ulrica
hesse
explaining
that
clara
was
now
to
take
possession
of
the
half
of
elsa
speier
s
room
that
had
been
left
empty
by
minna
poor
minna
now
with
her
good
parents
seeking
health
in
the
swiss
mountains
schooldays
at
an
end
at
an
end
at
an
end
she
repeated
mournfully
fraulein
explained
that
clara
s
third
of
the
large
room
would
now
be
miriam
s
miriam
stood
incredulous
at
her
side
as
she
indicated
a
large
empty
chest
of
drawers
a
white
covered
bed
in
a
deep
corner
away
from
the
window
a
small
drawer
in
the
and
five
pegs
in
a
large
french
wardrobe
emma
was
going
very
gravely
about
the
room
collecting
her
and
things
for
she
flung
one
ecstatic
glance
at
miriam
as
she
went
away
with
these
i
shall
hold
you
responsible
here
amongst
these
dear
children
miss
henderson
fluted
fraulein
quietly
gathering
up
a
few
last
things
of
minna
s
collected
on
the
bed
our
dear
ulrica
and
our
little
emma
she
smiled
passing
out
leaving
miriam
standing
in
the
wonderful
room
my
goodney
she
breathed
gathering
gently
clenched
fists
close
to
her
person
she
stood
for
a
few
moments
she
felt
like
a
visitor
embroidered
toilet
covers
polished
furniture
gold
and
cream
crockery
lace
curtains
white
beds
the
large
screen
cutting
off
her
third
of
the
room
then
she
rushed
headlong
upstairs
a
member
of
the
downstairs
landing
to
collect
her
belongings
on
the
landing
just
outside
the
door
of
the
garret
bedroom
stood
a
huge
wicker
travelling
basket
a
clumsy
umbrella
with
a
large
knobby
handle
like
a
man
s
umbrella
lay
on
the
top
of
it
partly
covering
a
large
pair
of
goloshes
she
was
tired
and
very
warm
by
the
time
everything
was
arranged
in
her
new
quarters
taking
a
last
look
round
she
caught
the
eye
of
eve
s
photograph
gazing
steadily
at
her
from
the
chest
of
drawers
it
would
be
quite
easy
now
that
this
had
happened
to
write
and
tell
them
that
the
pomerania
plan
had
come
to
nothing
evidently
fraulein
approved
of
her
after
all
in
the
schoolroom
she
found
the
party
gathered
round
the
table
at
its
head
sat
mademoiselle
her
arms
flung
out
upon
the
table
and
her
face
buried
against
them
cheer
up

said
jimmie
as
miriam
took
an
empty
chair
between
gertrude
and
the
martins
timidly
meeting
gertrude
s
eye
miriam
received
her
watched
her
eyebrows
flicker
faintly
up
and
the
little
despairing
shrug
she
gave
as
she
went
on
with
her
mending
ah

emma
consolingly
from

near
the
window

snuffling
and

the

interrogated
as
she
recovered
them

mademoiselle
her
suffused
little
face
came
up
for
a
moment
towards
solomon
she
met
miriam
s
gaze
as
if
she
did
not
see
her

demandez
pourquoi

ne

head
sank
again
and
her
little
grey
form
jerked
sharply
as
she
sobbed

mademoiselle
ventured

martin
oon
bertha
came
millie
s
correcting
voice
and
miriam
s
interest
changed
to
excited
thoughts
of
fraulein
not
hating
her
and
choosing
mademoiselle
to
sleep
with
the
servant
a
new
servant
the
things
on
the
landing
mademoiselle
refusing
to
share
a
room
with
a
married
woman
she
felt
about
round
this
idea
as
millie
s
prim
clear
voice
went
on
her
eyes
clutched
at
mademoiselle
begging
to
understand
she
gazed
at
the
little
head
fine
little
tendrils
frilling
along
the
edge
of
her
hair
her
little
hard
grey
shape
all
miserable
and
ashamed
it
was
dreadful
miriam
felt
she
could
not
bear
it
she
turned
away
it
was
a
strange
new
thought
that
anyone
should
object
to
being
with
a
married
woman
would
she
object
or
harriett
not
unless
it
were
suggested
to
them
was
there
some
special
refinement
in
this
french
girl
that
none
of
them
understood
why
should
it
be
refined
to
object
to
share
a
room
with
a
married
woman
a
cold
shadow
closed
in
on
miriam
s
mind
i
don
t
care
said
millie
almost
quickly
with
a
crimson
face
it
s
a
special
occasion
i
think
mademoiselle
ought
to
complain
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
should
write
home
it
s
not
right
fraulein
has
no
right
to
make
her
sleep
with
a
why
can

the
servant
sleep
in
one
of
the
back
attics

mademoiselle

to
bite
into

oh

she
gathered
herself
up
and
escaped
into
the
little
schoolroom

the
heat
grew
intense
the
air
was
more
and
more
oppressive
as
the
day
went
on
clara
fainted
suddenly
just
after
dinner
and
fraulein
holding
a
little
discourse
on
clothing
and
an
enquiry
into
wardrobes
gave
a
general
permission
for
the
reduction
of
garments
to
the
minimum
and
sent
everyone
to
rest
uncorseted
until
promising
a
walk
to
the
woods
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
there
was
a
sense
of
adventure
in
the
house
it
was
as
if
it
were
being
besieged
it
gave
miriam
confidence
to
approach
fraulein
for
permission
to
rearrange
her
trunk
in
the
basement
she
let
fraulein
understand
that
her
removal
was
not
complete
that
there
were
things
to
do
before
she
could
be
properly
settled
in
her
new
room
certainly
miss
henderson
you
are
quite
free
said
fraulein
instantly
as
the
girls
trooped
upstairs
miriam
knew
she
wanted
to
avoid
an
afternoon
shut
up
with
emma
and
ulrica
and
she
did
not
in
the
least
want
to
lie
down
it
seemed
to
her
a
very
extraordinary
thing
to
do
it
surprised
and
disturbed
her
it
suggested
illness
and
weakness
she
could
not
remember
having
lain
down
in
the
daytime
there
had
been
that
fortnight
in
the
old
room
at
home
with
harriett
and
new
books
coming
and
games
and
sarah
reading
the
song
of
hiawatha
and
their
being
allowed
to
choose
their
pudding
she
could
not
remember
feeling
had
she
ever
felt
ill
colds
and
bilious
attacks
she
remembered
with
triumph
a
group
of
days
of
pain
two
years
ago
she
had
forgotten
bewilderment
and
pain
her
mother
s
constant
presence
everything
the
light
everywhere
the
leaves
standing
out
along
the
tops
of
hedgerows
as
she
drove
with
her
mother
telling
her
of
pain
and
she
alone
in
the
midst
of
it
for
always
pride
long
moments
of
deep
pride
eve
and
sarah
congratulating
her
eve
stupid
and
laughing
the
new
bearing
of
the
servants
lily
belton
s
horrible
talks
fading
away
to
nothing
fraulein
had
left
her
and
gone
to
her
room
every
door
and
window
on
the
ground
floor
stood
wide
excepting
that
leading
to
fraulein
s
little
double
rooms
she
wondered
what
the
rooms
were
like
and
felt
sorry
for
fraulein
tall
and
gaunt
moving
about
in
them
alone
alone
with
her
own
dark
eyes
curtains
hanging
motionless
at
the
windows
was
it
really
bad
to
the
english
girls
except
millie
and
solomon
all
had
small
waists
she
wished
she
knew
she
placed
her
large
hands
round
her
waist
drawing
in
her
breath
she
could
almost
make
them
meet
it
was
to
feel
them
pulling
her
arms
from
their
sockets
dragging
her
shoulders
down
throwing
out
her
chest
to
spray
canful
after
canful
through
a
great
wide
rose
sprinkling
her
ankles
sometimes
and
to
grow
so
warm
that
she
would
not
feel
the
heat
bella
lyndon
had
never
worn
stays
playing
rounders
so
splendidly
lying
on
the
grass
between
the
games
with
her
arms
under
her
head
simply
disgusting
someone
had
said
who
a
disgusted
face
nearly
all
the
girls
detested
bella
going
through
the
hall
on
her
way
down
to
the
basement
she
heard
the
english
voices
sounding
quietly
out
into
the
afternoon
from
the
rooms
above
flat
and
tranquil
they
sounded
bertha
and
jimmie
she
heard
gertrude
s
undertones
quiet
words
from
millie
she
felt
she
would
like
a
corner
in
the
english
room
for
the
afternoon
a
book
and
an
occasional
remark
mr
barnes
of
new
york
she
would
not
be
able
to
read
her
three
yellow
books
in
the
german
bedroom
she
felt
at
the
moment
glad
to
be
robbed
of
them
it
would
be
much
better
of
course
there
was
no
sound
from
the
german
rooms
she
pictured
sleeping
faces
it
was
cooler
in
the
basement
but
even
there
the
air
seemed
stiff
and
dusty
with
the
heat
why
did
the
hanging
garments
remind
her
of
all
saints
church
and
mr
brough
she
must
tell
harriett
that
in
her
letter
that
day
they
suddenly
decided
to
help
in
the
church
decorations
she
remembered
the
smell
of
the
soot
on
the
holly
as
they
had
cut
and
hacked
at
it
in
the
cold
garden
and
harriett
overturning
the
heavy
wheelbarrow
on
the
way
to
church
and
how
they
had
not
laughed
because
they
both
felt
solemn
and
then
there
had
just
been
the
three
anwyl
girls
and
anwyl
and
scarr
and
brough
in
the
all
being
silly
about
birdy
anwyl
roasting
chestnuts
and
how
silly
and
affected
they
were
when
a
piece
of
holly
stuck
in
her
skirt
coming
up
the
basement
stairs
in
response
to
the
miriam
thought
there
were
visitors
in
the
hall
and
hesitated
then
there
was
pastor
lahmann
s
profile
disappearing
towards
the
door
and
fraulein
patting
and
dismissing
two
of
his
boys
his
face
looked
white
and
clear
and
firm
and
undisturbed
miriam
wanted
to
arrest
him
and
ask
him
something
what
he
thought
of
the
weather
he
looked
so
different
from
her
memory
of
him
in
the
saal
two
saturdays
ago
two
weeks
four
classes
she
must
have
missed
why
why
was
she
missing
pastor
lahmann
s
classes
how
had
it
happened
perhaps
she
would
see
him
in
class
again
perhaps
next
week
the
other
visitors
proved
to
be
the
bergmanns
in
new
dresses
miriam
gazed
at
clara
as
she
went
down
the
schoolroom
to
her
corner
of
the
table
she
looked
like
a
hostess
it
seemed
absurd
to
see
her
sit
down
to
tea
as
a
the
dress
was
a
fine
black
muslin
stamped
all
over
with
tiny
patches
of
mauve
it
was
cut
to
the
base
of
the
neck
and
came
to
a
point
in
front
where
the
soft
white
ruching
was
fastened
with
a
large
cameo
brooch
clara
s
pallid
worried
face
had
grown
more
placid
during
the
hot
inactive
days
and
her
hard
mouth
looked
patient
and
determined
and
responsible
she
seemed
quite
independent
of
her
surroundings
miriam
found
herself
again
and
again
consulting
her
calm
face
her
presence
haunted
miriam
throughout
emma
was
sweet
pink
and
bright
after
her
rest
in
a
bright
light
brown
muslin
dress
dotted
with
white
spots
funny
german
dresses
thought
miriam
funny
and
old
her
mind
hovered
and
wondered
over
these
german
dresses
did
she
like
them
or
not
something
about
them
she
glanced
at
elsa
sitting
opposite
in
the
dull
faint
electric
blue
with
black
lace
sleeves
she
had
worn
since
the
warm
weather
set
in
even
ulrica
thin
and
straight
now
like
a
pole
in
a
tight
flat
dress
of
saffron
muslin
sprigged
with
brown
leaves
seemed
to
be
included
in
something
that
made
all
these
german
dresses
utterly
different
from
anything
the
english
girls
could
have
worn
what
was
it
it
was
crowned
by
the
bergmanns
dresses
it
had
begun
in
a
summer
dress
of
minna
s
black
with
a
tiny
spot
and
a
heavy
ruche
round
the
hem
she
thought
she
liked
it
it
seemed
to
set
the
full
tide
of
summer
round
the
table
more
than
the
things
of
the
english
girls
and
yet
the
dresses
were
ugly
and
the
english
girls
dresses
were
not
that
they
were
nothing
plain
cottons
and
zephyrs
with
lace
tuckers
no
ruches
it
was
something
somehow
in
the
ruches
the
ruches
and
the
little
peaks
of
neck
a
faint
scent
of
camphor
came
from
the
martins
across
the
way
sitting
in
their
cool
creased
check
cotton
dresses
they
still
kept
to
their
hard
white
collars
and
cuffs
as
tea
went
on
miriam
found
her
eyes
drawn
back
and
back
again
to
these
newly
unpacked
dresses
and
when
conversation
broke
after
moments
of
stillness
shadowy
foliage
the
still
hot
garden
the
sunbaked
wooden
room
beyond
the
sunny
saal
the
light
pouring
through
three
rooms
and
bright
along
the
table
it
was
to
the
martins
check
dresses
that
she
glanced
it
was
intensely
hot
but
the
strain
had
gone
out
of
the
day
the
feeling
of
just
bearing
up
against
the
heat
and
getting
through
the
day
had
gone
they
all
sat
round
which
was
which
miriam
met
eye
after
eye
how
beautiful
they
all
were
looking
out
from
faces
and
meeting
hers
and
her
eyes
came
back
unembarrassed
to
her
cup
her
solid
butterbrot
and
the
sunlit
angle
of
the
garden
wall
and
the
bit
of
tree
just
over
fraulein
pfaff
s
shoulder
she
tried
to
meet
mademoiselle
s
eyes
she
felt
sure
their
eyes
could
meet
she
wondered
intensely
what
was
in
elsa
s
mind
behind
her
faint
hard
blue
dress
she
wanted
to
hear
mademoiselle
s
voice
mademoiselle
was
almost
invisible
in
her
corner
near
the
door
the
new
housekeeper
was
sitting
at
her
side
very
upright
and
close
to
the
table
once
or
twice
she
felt
fraulein
s
look
she
sustained
it
and
glowed
happily
under
it
without
meeting
it
she
referred
back
contentedly
to
it
after
hearing
herself
laugh
out
once
just
as
she
would
do
at
home
once
or
twice
she
forgot
for
a
moment
where
she
was
the
way
the
light
shone
on
the
housekeeper
s
hair
bright
brown
and
plastered
flatly
down
on
either
side
of
her
bright
face
and
the
curves
of
her
chocolate
and
white
striped
cotton
bodice
reminded
her
sharply
of
something
she
had
seen
once
something
that
had
charmed
her
it
was
in
the
hair
against
the
hard
white
of
the
forehead
and
the
flat
broad
cheeks
with
the
hard
clear
crimson
colouring
nearly
covering
them
something
in
the
way
she
sat
standing
out
against
the
others
judy
on
her
left
hand
with
almost
the
same
colouring
looked
small
and
gentle
and
refined
tea
was
over
fraulein
decided
against
a
walk
and
they
all
trooped
into
the
saal
no
programme
was
suggested
they
all
sat
about
unoccupied
there
was
no
centre
fraulein
pfaff
was
one
of
them
the
little
group
near
her
in
the
shady
half
of
the
sunlit
was
as
quietly
easy
as
those
who
sat
far
back
in
the
saal
miriam
had
got
into
a
low
chair
near
the
saal
doors
whence
she
could
see
across
the
room
through
the
window
through
the
gap
between
the
houses
across
the
way
to
the
afternoon
country
its
colours
gleamed
a
soft
confusion
of
tones
under
the
for
a
while
she
sat
with
her
eyes
on
fraulein
s
thin
profile
clean
and
cool
and
dry
in
the
intense
heat
she
must
be
looking
out
towards
the
ulrica
sat
drooped
on
a
low
chair
near
her
knees
sweet
beautiful
head
the
weight
of
her
soft
curved
mouth
seemed
too
much
for
the
delicate
angles
of
her
face
and
it
drooped
faintly
breaking
their
sharp
lines
miriam
wished
all
the
world
could
see
her
presently
ulrica
raised
her
head
as
elsa
and
clara
broke
into
words
and
laughter
near
her
and
her
drooping
lips
flattened
gently
back
into
their
place
in
the
curve
of
her
face
she
gazed
out
through
the
doorway
of
the
with
her
great
despairing
eyes
the
housekeeper
was
rather
like
a
dutch
doll
but
that
was
not
it
the
sun
had
set
miriam
had
found
a
little
thin
volume
of
german
poetry
in
her
pocket
she
sat
fumbling
the
leaves
she
felt
the
touch
of
her
limp
straightening
hair
upon
her
forehead
it
did
not
matter
twilight
would
soon
come
and
but
it
must
have
been
beginning
to
get
like
that
at
perhaps
the
weather
would
get
even
hotter
she
must
do
something
about
her
hair
if
only
she
could
wear
it
turned
straight
back
there
was
a
stirring
in
the
room
beautiful
forms
rose
and
stood
and
spoke
and
moved
about
someone
went
to
the
door
it
opened
gently
with
a
peaceful
sound
on
to
the
quiet
hall
and
footsteps
ran
upstairs
two
figures
going
out
from
the
saal
passed
in
front
of
the
two
still
sitting
quietly
grouped
in
the
light
of
the
they
were
challenged
as
they
passed
and
turned
soft
profiles
and
stood
talking
behind
the
voices
flutings
single
notes
broken
phrases
long
undisturbed
warblings
came
from
the
garden
clara
was
at
the
piano
tall
behind
her
stood
millie
s
gracious
shapeless
as
millie
s
voice
climbing
carefully
up
and
down
the
even
stages
of
solveig
s
song
reached
the
second
verse
miriam
tried
to
separate
the
music
from
the
words
the
words
were
wrong
she
half
saw
a
fair
woman
with
a
great
crown
of
plaited
hair
and
very
broad
shoulders
singing
the
song
in
the
hanover
in
norwegian
she
remembered
the
moment
of
taking
her
eyes
away
from
the
singer
and
the
platform
and
feeling
the
crowded
room
and
the
airlessness
and
then
the
song
going
steadily
on
from
note
to
note
as
she
listened
no
trills
and
no
tune
saying
something
it
stood
in
the
air
all
the
audience
were
saying
it
and
then
the
woman
had
sung
the
second
verse
as
though
it
was
something
about
herself
tragically
tragic
muse
it
was
not
her
song
standing
there
in
the
velvet
dress
she
stopped
it
from
going
on
there
was
nothing
but
the
movement
of
the
lace
round
her
shoulders
and
chest
her
expanded
neck
quivering
and
the
pressure
in
her
voice
and
then
there
had
been
herr
bossenberger
hammering
and
shouting
it
out
in
the
saal
with
millie
and
everything
in
the
schoolroom
even
the
dust
on
the
standing
out
clearer
and
clearer
as
he
bellowed
slowly
along
and
then
she
had
got
to
know
that
everybody
knew
about
it
it
was
a
famous
song
there
were
people
singing
it
everywhere
in
german
and
french
and
english
a
girl
singing
about
her
lover
it
was
not
that
even
if
people
sang
it
like
that
if
a
real
girl
had
ever
sung
something
like
that
that
was
not
what
she
meant
the
winter
may
pass
yes
that
was
all
right
and
mountains
with
green
slopes
and
narrow
torrents
and
a
voice
going
strongly
out
and
ceasing
and
all
the
sky
filled
with
the
sound
and
the
song
going
on
walking
along
thinking
to
itself
she
looked
about
as
millie
s
voice
ceased
trembling
on
the
last
high
note
she
hoped
no
one
would
hum
the
refrain
there
was
no
one
there
who
knew
anything
about
it
judy
judy
knew
perhaps
judy
would
never
hum
or
sing
anything
if
she
did
it
would
be
terrible
she
knew
so
much
perhaps
judy
knew
everything
she
was
sitting
on
the
low
sill
of
the
window
behind
the
piano
sewing
steel
beads
on
to
a
shot
silk
waistband
held
very
close
to
her
eyes
minna
could
minna
might
be
sitting
in
her
plaid
dress
on
the
with
her
embroidery
her
smooth
hair
polished
with
humming
solveig
s
song
the
housekeeper
brought
in
the
milk
and
rolls
and
went
away
downstairs
again
the
cold
milk
was
very
refreshing
but
the
room
grew
stifling
as
they
all
sat
round
near
the
little
centre
table
with
the
french
window
nearly
closed
shutting
off
the
and
garden
everybody
in
turn
seemed
to
be
saying
ik
kenne
meine
tasse
sie
ist
bertha
had
begun
it
holding
up
her
white
glass
of
milk
as
she
took
it
from
the
tray
and
exactly
imitating
the
housekeeper
s
voice
platt
deutsch
ja
clara
had
said
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
no
more
to
be
said
about
the
housekeeper
at
prayers
when
they
were
all
saying
vater
unser
she
heard
jimmie
murmur
ik
kenne
meine
fraulein
pfaff
came
upstairs
behind
the
girls
and
ordered
silence
as
they
went
to
their
rooms
hear
all
children
she
said
in
german
in
the
quiet
clear
even
tone
with
which
she
had
just
read
prayers
no
one
to
speak
to
her
neighbour
no
one
to
whisper
or
bustle
nor
to
brush
her
hair
but
each
to
compose
her
mind
and
go
quietly
to
her
rest
thus
acting
the
so
great
heat
shall
injure
none
of
us
and
peaceful
sleep
will
come
do
you
hear
children
answering
voices
came
from
the
bedrooms
she
entered
each
room
shifting
screens
opening
each
window
for
a
few
moments
leaving
each
door
wide
each
her
little
corner
she
said
in
miriam
s
room
fresh
water
set
for
the
morning
the
heavens
are
all
round
us
my
little
ones
have
no
gently
sighing
and
moaning
ulrica
moved
about
in
her
corner
emma
dropped
a
slipper
and
muttered
consolingly
thankfully
miriam
listened
to
fraulein
s
short
deprecating
footsteps
pacing
up
and
down
the
landing
she
was
safe
from
the
dreadful
challenge
of
conversation
with
her
pupils
she
felt
hemmed
in
in
the
stifling
room
with
the
landing
full
of
girls
all
round
her
she
wanted
to
push
away
her
screen
push
up
the
hot
white
ceiling
she
wished
she
could
be
safely
upstairs
with
mademoiselle
and
the
height
of
the
garret
above
her
head
it
could
not
possibly
be
hotter
up
there
than
in
this
stifling
room
with
its
draperies
and
furniture
and
gas
fraulein
came
in
very
soon
and
turned
out
the
light
with
a
formal
greeting
for
a
while
after
all
the
lights
were
out
she
continued
pacing
up
and
down
across
the
landing
someone
began
to
sneeze
rapidly
sneeze
after
sneeze
ach

muttered
emma
sleepily
for
several
minutes
the
sneezing
went
on
sighs
and
impatient
movements
sounded
here
and
there
ruhig

ruhig
millie
shall
soon
sleep
peacefully
as
miriam
could
not
remember
hearing
fraulein
pfaff
go
away
when
she
woke
in
the
darkness
feeling
unendurably
oppressed
she
flung
her
sheet
aside
and
turned
her
pillow
over
and
pushed
her
frilled
sleeves
to
her
elbows
how
energetic
i
am
she
thought
and
lay
tranquil
there
was
not
a
sound
i
shall
never
be
able
to
sleep
down
here
it
s
too
awful
she
murmured
and
puffed
and
shifted
her
head
on
the
pillow
the
may

the
may

the
winter

pass
the
academy
a
picture
in
very
bright
colours
a
woman
sitting
by
the
roadside
with
a
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
a
red
skirt
and
red
cheeks
and
bright
green
country
behind
her
people
moving
about
on
the
shiny
floor
someone
just
behind
saying
that
is
these
are
the
the
woman
in
the
picture
was
like
the
housekeeper
a
brilliant
light
flashed
into
the
room
lightning
how
strange
the
room
looked
the
screens
had
been
moved
the
walls
and
corners
and
little
beds
had
looked
like
daylight
someone
was
talking
across
the
landing
emma
was
awake
another
flash
came
and
movements
and
cries
emma
screamed
aloud
sitting
up
in
bed
ach
gott
clara
she
screamed
cries
came
from
the
next
room
a
match
was
struck
across
the
landing
and
voices
sounded
gertrude
was
in
the
room
lighting
the
gas
and
clara
tugging
down
the
blind
emma
was
sitting
with
her
hands
pressed
to
her
eyes
quickly
gasping
ach
clara
mein
gott
ach
gott
on
ulrica
s
bed
nothing
was
visible
but
a
mound
of
bedclothes
the
whole
landing
was
astir
fraulein
s
voice
called
up
urgently
from
below
miriam
was
the
last
to
reach
the
schoolroom
the
girls
were
drawn
up
on
either
side
of
the
gaslit
room
leaving
the
shuttered
windows
clear
she
moved
to
take
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
in
front
of
the
saal
doors
na
said
fraulein
sharply
from
the
not
there
in
full
current
her
voice
shook
miriam
drew
the
chair
to
the
end
of
the
room
of
figures
and
sat
down
next
to
solomon
martin
the
wind
rushed
through
the
garden
the
thunder
rattled
across
the
sky
oh
clara
fraulein
nein
gasped
emma
she
was
sitting
opposite
between
clara
and
jimmie
with
flushed
face
and
eyes
strained
wide
twisting
her
linked
hands
against
her
knees
jimmie
patted
her
wrist
it
s
all
right
emmchen
she
muttered
cheerfully
nein
christina
jerked
fraulein
sharply
i
will
not
have
that
to
touch
the
flesh
you
understand
all
that
you
know
all
such
immodesty
miriam
leaned
forward
and
glanced
fraulein
was
sitting
very
upright
on
the
sofa
in
a
shapeless
black
cloak
with
her
hands
clasped
on
her
breast
near
her
was
ulrica
in
her
trailing
white
her
face
pressed
against
the
back
of
the
sofa
in
the
far
corner
the
other
side
of
fraulein
sat
gertrude
in
her
grey
ulster
her
knees
comfortably
crossed
a
quilted
scarlet
silk
sticking
out
under
the
hem
of
her
ulster
the
thunder
crashed
and
pounded
just
above
them
everyone
started
and
exclaimed
emma
flung
her
arms
up
across
her
face
and
sat
back
in
her
chair
with
a
hooting
cry
from
the
sofa
came
a
hidden
sobbing
and
gasping
ach
himmel
ach
herr
ach
du
gott
miriam
wished
they
could
see
the
lightning
and
be
prepared
for
the
crashes
if
she
were
alone
she
would
watch
for
the
flashes
and
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
after
each
flash
the
shock
of
the
sound
was
intolerable
to
her
once
it
had
broken
she
drank
in
the
tumult
joyfully
she
sat
tense
and
miserable
longing
to
get
to
bed
she
wondered
whether
it
would
be
of
any
use
to
explain
to
fraulein
that
they
would
be
safer
in
their
iron
bedsteads
than
anywhere
in
the
house
she
tried
to
distract
her
thoughts
fancy
jimmie
s
name
being
christina
it
suited
her
exactly
sitting
there
in
her
little
striped
with
its
toby
frill
how
harriett
would
scream
if
she
could
see
them
all
sitting
round
but
she
and
harriett
had
once
lain
very
quiet
and
frightened
in
a
storm
by
the
sea
the
thunder
and
lightning
had
come
together
and
someone
had
looked
in
and
said
there
won
t
be
another
like
that
my
boots
i
should
hope
not
harriett
had
said
for
a
while
it
seemed
as
though
cannon
balls
were
being
thumped
down
and
rumbled
about
on
the
floor
above
then
came
another
deafening
crash
jimmie
laughed
and
put
up
her
hand
to
her
as
if
to
see
whether
it
was
still
there
outcries
came
from
all
over
the
room
after
the
first
shock
which
had
made
her
sit
up
sharply
and
draw
herself
convulsively
together
miriam
found
herself
turning
towards
solomon
martin
who
had
also
stirred
and
sat
forward
their
eyes
met
full
and
consulted
solomon
s
lips
were
compressed
her
perspiring
face
was
alight
and
determined
miriam
felt
that
she
looked
for
long
into
those
steady
oily
brown
eyes
when
they
both
relaxed
she
sat
back
catching
a
sympathetic
challenging
flash
from
gertrude
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
felt
proud
and
easy
let
it
bang
she
said
to
herself
i
must
think
of
doors
suddenly
banging
that
never
makes
me
jumpy
and
she
sat
easily
breathing
fraulein
had
said
something
in
german
in
a
panting
voice
and
bertha
had
stood
up
and
said
i
ll
get
the
bible
ei

shouted
clara
stay
only
here
stay
only

nein

mein

fraulein
sadly
it
s
really
perfectly
all
right
fraulein
said
bertha
getting
quietly
to
the
door
as
fraulein
opened
the
great
book
on
her
knees
the
rain
hissed
down
into
the
garden
gott
sei
dank
she
said
in
a
clear
childlike
voice
it
dot
besser
wenn
da
regnet
enquired
the
housekeeper
looking
round
the
room
she
began
vigorously
wiping
her
face
and
neck
with
the
skirt
of
the
short
cotton
jacket
she
wore
over
her
red
petticoat
ulrica
broke
into
steady
weeping
fraulein
read
psalms
ejaculating
the
short
phrases
as
if
they
were
petitions
with
a
pause
between
each
when
the
thunder
came
she
raised
her
voice
against
it
and
read
more
rapidly
as
the
storm
began
to
abate
a
little
party
of
english
went
to
the
kitchen
and
brought
back
milk
and
biscuits
and
jam
you
will
be
asleep
miss
miriam
started
at
the
sound
of
ulrica
s
wailing
whisper
fraulein
had
only
just
gone
she
had
been
sitting
on
the
end
of
emma
s
bed
talking
quietly
of
and
now
emma
was
asleep
ulrica
s
corner
had
been
perfectly
quiet
miriam
had
been
lying
listening
to
the
steady
swishing
of
the
rain
against
the
chestnut
leaves
no
what
is
it
oh
most
wonderful
ich

good
gute

ach
wie
empfindlich
bin
ich
wie
empfindlich
miriam
lay
thinking
of
how
she
and
harriett
on
their
confirmation
morning
had
met
the
vicar
in
the
upper
richmond
road
having
gone
out
contrary
to
the
desire
expressed
by
him
at
his
last
preparation
class
and
how
he
had
stopped
and
greeted
them
she
had
tried
to
look
vague
and
sad
and
to
murmur
something
in
spite
of
the
bull
in
her
cheek
and
had
suddenly
noticed
as
they
stood
grouped
that
harriett
s
little
hat
was
askew
and
her
brown
eye
underneath
it
was
glaring
fixedly
at
the
vicar
above
the
little
knob
in
her
cheek
and
how
they
somehow
got
away
and
went
gently
reeling
and
colliding
moaning
and
gasping
down
the
road
out
of
hearing
early
next
morning
judy
came
in
to
tell
emma
and
ulrica
to
get
up
at
once
and
come
and
help
the
housekeeper
make
the
rooms
tidy
and
prepare
breakfast
miriam
lay
motionless
while
emma
unfolded
and
arranged
the
screens
then
she
gazed
at
the
ceiling
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
tranquil
and
unchallenged
while
others
moved
busily
about
two
separate
sudden
and
resounding
garglings
almost
startled
her
to
thought
but
she
resisted
and
presently
she
was
alone
in
the
strange
room
she
supposed
it
must
be
cooler
after
the
storm
she
felt
strong
and
languid
she
could
feel
the
shape
and
weight
of
each
limb
sounds
came
to
her
with
perfect
distinctness
the
sounds
downstairs
and
a
conversation
across
the
landing
little
faint
marks
that
human
beings
were
making
on
the
great
wide
stillness
the
stillness
that
brooded
along
her
white
ceiling
and
all
round
her
and
right
out
through
the
world
the
faint
scent
of
her
reached
her
from
the
distant
she
felt
that
her
short
sleep
must
have
been
perfect
that
it
had
carried
her
down
and
down
into
the
heart
of
tranquillity
where
she
still
lay
awake
and
drinking
as
if
at
a
source
cool
streams
seemed
to
be
flowing
in
her
brain
through
her
heart
through
every
vein
her
breath
was
like
a
live
cool
stream
flowing
through
her
she
remembered
that
she
had
dreamed
her
favourite
dream
floating
through
clouds
and
above
treetops
and
villages
she
had
almost
brushed
the
treetops
that
had
been
the
happiest
moment
and
had
caught
sight
of
a
circular
seat
round
the
trunk
of
a
large
old
tree
and
a
group
of
white
cottages
she
stirred
her
hands
seemed
warm
on
her
cool
chest
and
the
warmth
of
her
body
sent
up
a
faint
pleasant
sense
of
personality
it
s
me
she
said
and
smiled
look
here
you
d
better
get
up
my
dear
she
murmured
she
wanted
to
have
the
whole
world
in
and
be
reconciled
but
she
knew
that
if
anyone
came
she
would
contract
and
the
expression
of
her
face
would
change
and
they
would
hate
her
or
be
indifferent
she
knew
that
if
she
even
moved
she
would
be
changed
get
she
listened
for
a
while
to
two
voices
across
the
landing
millie
s
thick
and
plaintive
with
her
and
bertha
s
thin
and
cold
and
level
and
reassuring
bertha
s
voice
was
like
the
morning
clean
and
cool
then
she
got
up
and
shut
the
door
the
sky
was
a
vivid
grey
against
its
dark
background
the
tops
of
heavy
masses
of
cloud
were
standing
up
just
above
the
of
the
houses
beyond
the
neighbouring
gardens
the
trees
and
the
grey
roofs
and
the
faces
of
the
houses
were
staringly
bright
they
were
absolutely
stiff
nothing
was
moving
there
were
no
shadows
a
soft
distant
rumble
of
thunder
came
as
she
was
dressing
the
storm
was
still
going
on
what
an
extraordinary
time
of
day
for
thunder
the
excitement
was
not
over
they
were
still
a
besieged
party
all
staying
at
the
bienenkorb
together
how
beautiful
it
sounded
rumbling
away
over
the
country
in
the
morning
when
she
had
finished
struggling
with
her
long
thick
hair
and
put
the
hairpins
into
the
solid
coil
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
tied
the
stout
doubled
plait
at
her
neck
she
put
on
the
blouse
the
mirror
was
lower
and
twice
as
large
as
the
one
in
the
garret
larger
than
the
one
she
had
shared
with
harriett
how
jolly
i
look
she
thought
jolly
and
big
somehow
mother
would
like
me
this
morning
i
pinky
red
and
yellow
hair
but
i
haven
t
got
a
german
expression
and
i
don
t
smile
like
a
german
she
smiled
silly
doll
never
mind
i
look
jolly
she
looked
gravely
into
her
eyes
there
s
something
about
my
her
face
grew
wistful
it
isn
t
vain
to
like
it
it
s
something
it
isn
t
me
it
s
something
i
am
somehow
oh
stay
she
said
do
be
like
that
she
sighed
and
turned
away
saying
in
harriett
s
voice
oo
crumbs
this
is
no
place
for
the
sky
seen
from
the
was
darker
still
there
were
no
massed
clouds
nothing
but
a
hard
even
dark
and
away
through
the
gap
the
distant
country
was
bright
like
a
little
painted
scene
on
the
horizon
the
hard
dark
sky
shut
down
at
intervals
thunder
rumbled
evenly
far
away
miriam
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
it
was
the
morning
saal
lay
in
a
hot
sultry
twilight
the
air
in
the
was
heavy
and
damp
she
stood
with
her
hands
gathered
against
her
how
perfectly
magnificent
she
murmured
gazing
out
through
the
hard
to
where
the
brightly
coloured
world
lay
in
a
strip
and
ended
on
the
hard
sky
yes
yes
came
a
sad
low
voice
at
her
side
for
a
second
miriam
did
not
turn
she
drank
in
the
quiet
yes
yes
the
hard
fixed
scene
seemed
to
move
who
loved
it
too
the
dark
sky
and
the
storm
then
she
focussed
her
companion
who
was
standing
a
little
behind
her
and
gazed
at
fraulein
she
hardly
saw
her
she
seemed
still
to
see
the
outdoor
picture
fraulein
made
a
movement
towards
her
and
then
she
saw
for
a
moment
the
strange
grave
young
look
in
her
eyes
fraulein
had
looked
at
her
in
that
moment
as
an
equal
it
was
as
if
they
had
embraced
each
other
then
fraulein
said
sadly
you
like
the
miss
fraulein
sighed
looking
out
across
the
country
we
are
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
she
murmured
come
to
your
breakfast
my
child
she
chided
smiling
there
was
no
church
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sky
lifted
they
all
went
to
the
woods
in
their
summer
dresses
and
hats
they
had
permission
to
carry
their
gloves
and
elsa
speier
s
parasol
and
lace
scarf
hung
from
her
wrist
the
sky
was
growing
higher
and
lighter
but
there
was
no
sun
they
entered
the
dark
woods
by
a
little
pathway
and
for
a
while
there
was
a
strip
of
sky
above
their
heads
but
presently
the
trees
grew
tall
and
dense
the
sky
was
shut
out
and
their
footsteps
and
voices
began
to
echo
about
them
as
they
straggled
along
grouping
and
regrouping
as
the
pathway
widened
and
narrowed
gathering
their
skirts
clear
of
the
wet
undergrowth
they
crossed
a
roadway
and
two
carriage
loads
of
men
and
women
talking
and
laughing
and
shouting
with
shining
red
faces
passed
swiftly
by
one
close
behind
the
other
beyond
the
roadway
the
great
trees
towered
up
in
a
sort
of
twilight
there
were
no
flowers
here
but
bright
fungi
shone
here
and
there
about
the
roots
of
the
trees
and
they
all
stood
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
tinkling
of
a
little
stream
pathways
led
away
in
all
directions
it
was
growing
lighter
there
were
faint
chequers
of
light
and
shade
about
them
as
they
walked
the
forest
was
growing
golden
all
round
them
lifting
and
opening
gold
and
green
clearer
and
clearer
there
were
bright
jewelled
patches
in
amongst
the
trees
the
boles
of
the
trees
shone
out
sharp
grey
and
silver
and
flaked
with
sharp
green
leaves
away
and
away
until
they
melted
into
a
mist
of
leafage
singing
sounded
suddenly
away
in
the
wood
a
sudden
strong
shouting
of
men
s
voices
singing
together
like
one
voice
in
four
parts
four
shouts
in
one
sound

between
the
two
exclamatory
shouts
the
echo
rang
through
the
woods
and
the
listening
girls
heard
the
sharp
drip
drip
and
murmur
of
the
little
stream
near
by
then
the
voices
swung
on
into
the
song
strongly
interwoven
swelling
and
lifting
dropping
to
a
soft
even
staccato
and
swelling
strongly

there
was
a
faint
distant
sound
of
crackling

and
the
echo
of
talking
and
laughter

chapter
ix
the
next
afternoon
they
all
drove
in
a
high
wide
brake
with
an
awning
five
miles
out
into
the
country
to
have
tea
at
a
the
inn
appeared
at
last
standing
back
from
the
wide
roadway
along
which
they
had
come
and
long
and
low
and
with
overhanging
eaves
close
against
the
forest
they
pulled
up
and
pastor
lahmann
dropped
the
steps
and
got
out
miriam
who
was
sitting
next
to
the
door
felt
that
the
long
sitting
in
two
rows
confronted
in
the
hard
afternoon
light
bumped
and
shaken
and
teased
with
the
crunchings
and
slitherings
of
the
wheels
the
grinding
and
squeaking
of
the
brake
had
made
them
all
enemies
she
had
sat
tense
and
averted
seeing
the
general
greenery
feeling
that
the
cool
flowing
air
might
be
great
happiness
conscious
of
each
form
and
each
voice
of
the
insincerity
of
the
exclamations
and
the
babble
of
conversation
that
struggled
above
the
noise
of
their
going
half
seeing
pastor
lahmann
opposite
to
her
a
little
insincerely
smiling
man
in
an
alpaca
suit
and
a
soft
felt
hat
she
got
down
the
steps
without
his
assistance
with
whom
should
she
take
refuge
no
minna
there
were
long
tables
and
little
round
tables
standing
about
under
the
trees
in
front
of
the
inn
some
students
in
polytechnik
uniform
were
leaning
out
of
an
upper
window
the
landlord
came
out
everyone
was
out
of
the
brake
and
standing
about
tall
fraulein
was
taking
short
padding
steps
towards
the
a
strong
grip
came
on
miriam
s
arm
and
she
was
propelled
rapidly
along
towards
the
farther
greenery
gertrude
was
talking
to
her
in
loud
rallying
tones
asking
questions
in
german
and
answering
them
herself
miriam
glanced
round
at
her
face
it
was
crimson
and
quivering
with
laughter
the
strong
laughter
and
her
strong
features
seemed
to
hide
the
peculiar
roughness
of
her
skin
and
coarseness
of
her
hair
they
made
the
round
of
one
of
the
long
tables
when
they
were
on
the
far
side
gertrude
said
i
think
you
ll
see
a
friend
of
mine
d
you
mean
erica
s
brother
there
s
his
chum
anyhow
at

oh
i
hah

eh
happy
thought
of
lily
s
to
bring
us
miriam
pondered
distressed
you
must
tell
me
which
it
is
if
we
see
their
party
was
taking
possession
of
a
long
table
near
by
returning
to
her
voluble
talk
gertrude
steered
miriam
towards
them
as
they
settled
round
the
table
under
the
quiet
trees
the
first
part
of
the
waltz
movement
of
weber
s
invitation
sounded
out
through
the
upper
window
the
brilliant
tuneless
passages
bounding
singly
up
the
piano
flowing
down
entwined
were
shaped
by
an
iron
rhythm
everyone
stirred
smiles
broke
fraulein
lifted
her
head
until
her
chin
was
high
smiled
slowly
until
the
fullest
width
was
reached
and
made
a
little
chiding
sound
in
her
throat
pastor
lahmann
laughed
with
raised
eyebrows
ah
la
valse
les
the
window
was
empty
the
assault
settled
into
a
waltz
as
the
waiter
finished
clattering
down
a
circle
of
cups
and
saucers
in
front
of
fraulein
the
unseen
iron
hands
dropped
tenderly
into
the
central
melody
of
the
waltz
the
notes
no
longer
bounded
and
leaped
but
went
dreaming
along
in
an
even
slow
swinging
movement
it
seemed
to
miriam
that
the
sound
of
a
sea
was
in
them
and
the
wind
and
the
movement
of
distant
trees
and
the
shedding
and
pouring
of
faraway
moonlight
one
by
one
delicately
and
quietly
the
young
men
s
voices
dropped
in
and
the
sea
and
the
wind
and
the
trees
and
the
pouring
moonlight
came
near
when
the
music
ceased
miriam
hoped
she
had
not
been
gazing
at
the
window
it
frightened
and
disgusted
her
to
see
that
all
the
girls
seemed
to
be
sitting
up
and
being
bright
affected
she
could
hardly
believe
it
she
flushed
with
shame
fast
horrid
perfect
strangers
it
was
terrible
it
spoilt
everything
sitting
up
like
that
and
grimacing
it
was
different
for
gertrude
how
happy
gertrude
must
be
she
was
sitting
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
laughing
out
across
the
table
about
something
millie
was
not
being
horrid
she
looked
just
as
usual
pudgy
and
babyish
and
surprised
and
half
resentful
it
was
her
eyebrows
miriam
began
looking
at
eyebrows
there
was
a
sudden
silence
all
round
the
table
standing
at
fraulein
s
side
was
a
young
student
holding
his
peaked
cap
in
his
hand
and
bowing
with
downcast
eyes
above
his
pallid
scarred
face
his
hair
stood
upright
he
bowed
at
the
end
of
each
phrase
miriam
s
heart
bounded
in
anticipation
would
fraulein
let
them
dance
after
tea
on
the
grass
but
fraulein
with
many
smiles
and
kind
words
denied
the
young
man
s
formally
repeated
pleadings
they
finished
tea
to
the
strains
of
a
funeral
march
they
were
driving
swiftly
along
through
the
twilight
the
warm
scents
of
the
woods
stood
across
the
roadway
they
breathed
them
in
sitting
at
the
forward
end
of
the
brake
miriam
could
turn
and
see
the
shining
of
the
road
and
the
edges
of
the
high
woods
underneath
the
awning
faces
were
growing
dim
warm
at
her
side
was
emma
emma
s
hand
was
on
her
arm
under
a
mass
of
fern
and
grasses
voices
quivered
and
laughed
miriam
looked
again
and
again
at
pastor
lahmann
sitting
almost
opposite
to
her
next
to
fraulein
pfaff
she
could
look
at
him
more
easily
than
at
either
of
the
girls
she
felt
that
only
he
could
feel
the
beauty
of
the
evening
exactly
as
she
did
several
times
she
met
and
quietly
contemplated
his
dark
eyes
she
felt
that
there
was
someone
in
those
eyes
who
was
neither
tiresome
nor
tame
she
was
looking
at
someone
to
whom
those
boys
and
that
dead
wife
were
nothing
at
first
he
had
met
her
eyes
formally
then
with
obvious
embarrassment
and
at
last
simply
and
gravely
she
felt
easy
and
happy
in
this
communion
dimly
she
was
conscious
that
it
sustained
her
it
gave
her
dignity
and
poise
she
thought
that
its
meaning
must
if
she
observed
it
at
all
be
quite
obvious
to
fraulein
and
must
reveal
her
to
her
presently
her
eyes
were
drawn
to
meet
fraulein
s
and
she
read
there
a
disgust
and
a
loathing
such
as
she
had
never
seen
the
woods
receded
the
beauty
dropped
out
of
them
the
crunching
of
the
wheels
sounded
out
suddenly
what
was
the
good
of
the
of
grimacing
people
miriam
wanted
to
stop
it
and
get
out
and
stroll
home
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
with
the
quiet
man
haben
die
damen
veilleicht
ein
rad
verloren
a
deep
voice
on
the
steps
of
the
brake
have
the
ladies
lost
a
wheel
perhaps
miriam
translated
helplessly
to
herself
during
a
general
outbreak
of
laughter
in
a
moment
a
brake
overtook
them
and
drove
alongside
in
the
twilight
the
drivers
whipped
up
their
horses
the
two
vehicles
raced
and
rumbled
along
keeping
close
together
fraulein
called
to
their
driver
to
desist
the
students
slackened
down
too
and
began
singing
at
random
one
against
the
other
those
on
the
near
side
standing
up
and
bowing
and
laughing
a
bouquet
of
fern
fronds
came
in
over
judy
s
head
missing
the
awning
and
falling
against
clara
s
knees
she
rose
and
flung
it
back
and
then
everyone
seemed
to
be
standing
up
and
laughing
and
throwing
they
drove
home
slowly
side
by
side
shouting
and
singing
and
throwing
warm
blinding
masses
of
fragrant
grass
came
from
the
students
brake
and
were
thrown
to
and
fro
through
the
darkness
lit
by
the
lamps
of
the
two
carriages
chapter
x
towards
the
end
of
june
there
were
frequent
excursions
into
all
the
gatherings
at
waldstrasse
the
outside
world
came
like
a
presence
it
removed
the
sense
of
pressure
of
being
confronted
and
challenged
everything
that
was
said
seemed
to
be
incidental
to
it
like
remarks
dropped
in
a
low
tone
between
individuals
at
a
great
conference
miriam
wondered
again
and
again
whether
her
companions
shared
this
sense
with
her
sometimes
when
they
were
all
sitting
together
she
longed
to
ask
to
find
out
to
get
some
public
acknowledgment
of
the
magic
that
lay
over
everything
at
times
it
seemed
as
if
could
they
all
be
still
for
a
moment
it
must
take
shape
it
was
everywhere
in
the
food
in
the
fragrance
rising
from
the
opened
lid
of
the
in
all
the
needful
unquestioned
movements
the
requests
the
handings
and
thanks
the
going
from
room
to
room
the
partings
and
assemblings
it
hung
about
the
fabrics
and
fittings
of
the
house
overwhelmingly
it
came
in
through
oblongs
of
window
giving
on
to
stairways
going
upstairs
in
the
light
pouring
in
from
some
uncurtained
window
she
would
cease
for
a
moment
to
breathe
whenever
she
found
herself
alone
she
began
to
sing
softly
when
she
was
with
others
a
head
drooped
or
lifted
the
movement
of
a
hand
the
light
falling
along
the
detail
of
a
profile
could
fill
her
with
happiness
it
made
companionship
a
perpetual
question
at
rare
moments
there
would
come
a
tingling
from
head
to
foot
a
faint
buzzing
at
her
lips
and
at
the
tip
of
each
finger
at
these
moments
she
could
raise
her
eyes
calmly
to
those
about
her
and
drink
in
the
fact
of
their
presence
see
them
all
with
perfect
distinctness
but
without
distinguishing
one
from
the
other
she
wanted
to
say
isn
t
it
extraordinary
do
you
realise
she
felt
that
if
only
she
could
make
her
meaning
clear
all
difficulties
must
vanish
outside
in
the
open
going
forward
to
some
goal
through
sunny
mornings
gathering
at
inns
wading
through
the
scented
undergrowth
of
the
woods
she
would
dream
of
the
secure
return
to
waldstrasse
their
own
beleaguered
place
she
saw
it
opening
out
warm
and
familiar
back
and
back
to
the
strange
beginning
in
the
winter
they
would
be
there
again
singing
one
morning
she
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
change
the
term
was
coming
to
an
end
there
was
to
be
a
going
away
the
girls
were
talking
about
going
to
norderney
hendy
jimmie
said
suddenly
ah
she
responded
mysteriously
for
the
rest
of
that
day
she
sat
contracted
and
fearful
you
shall
write
and
enquire
of
your
good
parents
what
they
would
have
you
do
you
shall
tell
them
that
the
german
pupils
return
all
to
their
homes
that
the
english
pupils
go
for
a
happy
holiday
to
the
oh
yes
said
miriam
conversationally
with
trembling
breath
it
is
of
course
evident
that
since
you
will
have
no
duties
to
perform
i
can
not
support
the
expense
of
your
travelling
and
your
oh
no
of
course
not
said
miriam
her
hands
pressed
against
her
knee
she
sat
shivering
in
the
warm
dim
saal
shaded
by
the
close
it
looked
as
she
had
seen
it
with
her
father
for
the
first
time
and
fraulein
sitting
near
seemed
to
be
once
more
in
the
heavy
panniered
blue
velvet
dress
she
waited
stiff
and
ugly
till
fraulein
secure
and
spoke
softly
again
you
think
my
child
you
shall
like
the
profession
of
a
teacher
oh
yes
said
miriam
from
the
midst
of
a
tingling
flush
i
think
you
have
many
qualities
that
make
the
teacher
you
are
earnest
and
grave
sometimes
perhaps
overgrave
for
your
years
but
you
have
a
serious
fault
which
must
be
corrected
if
you
wish
to
succeed
in
your
miriam
tried
to
pull
her
features
into
an
easy
enquiring
seriousness
a
darkness
was
threatening
her
you
have
a
most
unfortunate
without
relaxing
miriam
quivered
she
felt
the
blood
mount
to
her
head
you
must
adopt
a
quite
quite
different
manner
your
influence
is
i
think
good
a
good
english
influence
in
its
most
general
effect
but
it
is
too
slightly
so
and
of
too
much
indirection
you
must
exert
it
yourself
in
a
manner
more
alive
you
must
make
it
your
aim
that
you
shall
have
a
responsible
influence
a
direct
personal
influence
you
have
too
much
of
chill
and
formality
it
makes
a
stiffness
that
i
am
willing
to
believe
you
do
not
miriam
felt
a
faint
dizziness
if
you
should
fail
to
become
more
genial
more
simple
and
natural
as
to
your
bearing
you
will
neither
make
yourself
understood
nor
will
you
be
loved
by
your
no
responded
miriam
assuming
an
air
of
puzzled
and
interested
consideration
of
fraulein
s
words
she
was
recovering
she
must
get
to
the
end
of
the
interview
and
get
away
and
find
the
answer
far
away
beneath
her
fear
and
indignation
fraulein
was
answered
she
must
get
away
and
say
the
answer
to
herself
to
truly
fulfil
the
most
serious
role
of
the
teacher
you
must
enter
into
the
personality
of
each
pupil
and
must
sympathise
with
the
struggles
of
each
one
upon
the
path
on
which
our
feet
are
set
efforts
to
good
kindliness
and
thought
for
others
must
be
encouraged
the
teacher
shall
he
sunshine
human
sunshine
encouraging
all
effort
and
all
lovely
things
in
the
personality
of
the
fraulein
rose
and
stood
tall
then
her
decorous
footsteps
began
miriam
had
hardly
listened
to
her
last
words
she
felt
tears
of
anger
rising
and
tried
to
smile
i
shall
say
now
no
more
but
when
you
shall
hear
from
your
good
parents
we
can
further
discuss
our
fraulein
was
at
the
door
fraulein
left
the
saal
by
the
small
door
and
miriam
felt
her
way
to
the
schoolroom
the
girls
were
gathering
there
ready
for
a
walk
some
were
in
the
hall
and
fraulein
s
voice
was
giving
instructions
machen

schnell
miss
henderson
she
called
fraulein
had
never
before
called
to
her
like
that
it
had
always
been
as
if
she
did
not
see
her
but
assumed
her
ready
to
fall
in
with
the
general
movements
now
it
was
fraulein
calling
to
her
as
she
might
do
to
gertrude
or
solomon
there
was
no
hurried
whisper
from
jimmie
telling
her
to
fly
for
her
ja
fraulein
she
cried
gaily
and
blundered
towards
the
basement
stairs
mademoiselle
was
standing
averted
at
the
head
of
them
miriam
glanced
at
her
her
face
was
red
and
swollen
with
crying
the
sight
amazed
miriam
she
considered
the
swollen
suffusion
under
the
large
black
hat
as
she
ran
downstairs
she
hoped
mademoiselle
did
not
see
her
glance
mademoiselle
standing
there
all
disfigured
and
blotchy
about
something
it
was
nothing
it
couldn
t
be
anything
if
anyone
were
dead
she
would
not
be
standing
there
it
was
just
some
silly
prim
french
quirk
her
dignity
someone
had
been
grossiere
and
there
she
stood
in
her
black
hat
and
black
cotton
gloves
hurriedly
putting
on
her
hat
and
long
lace
scarf
she
decided
that
she
would
not
change
her
shoes
somewhere
out
in
the
sunshine
a
piped
out
the
air
of

glanced
at
the
frosted
barred
window
through
which
the
dim
light
came
into
the
the
piping
notes
out
of
tune
wrongly
emphasised
slurring
one
into
the
other
followed
her
across
the
dark
basement
hall
and
came
faintly
to
her
as
she
went
slowly
upstairs
there
was
no
hurry
everyone
was
talking
busily
in
the
hall
drowning
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
she
had
forgotten
her
gloves
she
went
back
into
the
cool
grey
musty
rooms
a
little
crack
in
an
upper
pane
shone
like
a
gold
thread
the
piped
as
she
stooped
to
gather
up
her
gloves
from
the
floor
she
felt
the
cold
stone
firm
and
secure
under
her
hand
and
the
house
stood
up
all
round
her
with
its
rooms
and
the
light
lying
along
stairways
and
passages
and
outside
the
bright
hot
sunshine
and
the
roadways
leading
in
all
directions
out
into
germany
how
could
fraulein
possibly
think
she
could
afford
to
go
to
norderney
they
would
all
go
things
would
go
on
she
could
not
go
there
nor
back
to
england
it
was
cruel
just
torture
and
worry
again
with
the
bright
house
all
round
her
the
high
rooms
the
dark
old
pianos
strange
old
garret
the
unopened
door
beyond
it
no
help
anywhere
as
they
walked
she
laughed
and
talked
with
the
girls
responding
excitedly
to
all
that
was
said
they
walked
along
a
broad
and
almost
empty
boulevard
in
two
rows
of
four
and
five
abreast
with
mademoiselle
and
judy
bringing
up
the
rear
the
talk
was
general
and
there
was
much
laughter
it
was
the
kind
of
interchange
that
arose
when
they
were
all
together
and
there
was
anything
in
the
air
the
kind
that
miriam
most
disliked
she
joined
in
it
feverishly
it
s
perfectly
natural
that
they
should
all
be
excited
about
the
holidays
she
told
herself
stifling
her
thoughts
but
it
must
not
go
too
far
they
wanted
to
be
jolly
if
i
could
be
jolly
too
they
would
like
me
i
must
not
be
a
wet
blanket
mademoiselle
s
voice
was
not
heard
miriam
felt
that
the
steering
of
the
conversation
might
fall
to
anyone
mademoiselle
was
extinguished
she
must
exert
her
influence
presently
she
forgot
mademoiselle
s
presence
altogether
they
were
all
walking
along
very
quickly
if
she
were
going
to
norderney
with
the
english
girls
she
must
be
on
easy
terms
with
them
ah
ha
somebody
was
saying
said
miriam
in
response
came
another
voice
trilled
bertha
martin
gently
you
mean
said
miriam

you
hendy

a
swinging

children
giggled
jimmie
millie
looked
pensively
about
her
with
vague
disapproval
her
eyebrows
were
up
it
seemed
as
if
anything
might
happen
as
if
at
any
moment
they
might
all
begin
running
in
different
directions
my
dear
brats

bertha

ah

miriam
saw
her
companions
looking
across
the
boulevard
following
their
eyes
she
found
the
figure
of
pastor
lahmann
walking
swiftly
bag
in
hand
in
the
direction
of
an
opening
into
a
side
street
ah
she
cried
gaily
voila
monsieur
courrez
mademoiselle
at
once
she
felt
that
it
was
cruel
to
draw
attention
to
mademoiselle
when
she
was
dumpy
and
upset
what
a
fool
i
am
she
moaned
in
her
mind
why
can
t
i
say
the
right
thing
ce

said
mademoiselle
qui
fait
les
the
group
walked
on
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
bertha
martin
was
swinging
her
left
foot
out
across
the
curb
with
each
step
giving
her
right
heel
a
little
twirl
to
keep
her
balance
you
are
very
clever
said
mademoiselle
still
in
french
but
you
will
never
make
a
prima
hulloh
breathed
jimmie
she
s
perking
isn
t
she
said
miriam
feeling
that
she
was
throwing
away
the
last
shred
of
her
dignity
what
was
the
matter
she
continued
trying
to
escape
from
her
confusion
mademoiselle
s
instant
response
to
her
cry
at
the
sight
of
pastor
lahmann
rang
in
her
ears
she
blushed
to
the
soles
of
her
feet
how
could
mademoiselle
misunderstand
her
insane
remark
what
did
she
mean
what
did
she
really
think
of
her
just
kind
old
lahmann
walking
along
there
in
the
outside
world
did
not
want
to
stop
him
he
was
a
sort
of
kinsman
for
mademoiselle
that
was
what
she
had
meant
oh
why
couldn
t
she
get
away
from
all
these
girls
indeed
and
again
she
saw
the
hurrying
figure
which
had
disappeared
leaving
the
boulevard
with
its
usual
effect
of
a
great
strange
ocean
he
could
have
brought
help
and
comfort
to
all
of
them
if
he
had
seen
them
and
stopped
pastor
lahmann
lahmann
perhaps
she
would
not
see
him
again
perhaps
he
could
tell
her
what
she
ought
to
do
oh
my
dear
jimmie
was
saying
didn
t
you
know
a
fearful
mademoiselle
s
laughter
tinkled
out
from
the
rear
a
row
fearful
jimmie
s
face
came
round
under
her
white
sailor
hat
that
sat
slightly
tilted
on
the
peak
of
her
hair
what
about
something
about
a
letter
or
something
or
some
letters
or
something
i
don
t
know
something
she
took
out
of
the
it
was
unlocked
or
something
and
ulrica
saw
her
told
lily
goodness
breathed
miriam
yes
and
lily
had
her
in
her
room
and
ulrica
and
poor
little
petite
couldn
t
deny
it
ulrica
said
she
did
nothing
but
cry
and
cry
she
s
been
crying
all
the
morning
poor
little
why
did
she
want
to
take
anything
out
of
the
box
oh
i
don
t
know
there
was
a
fearful
row
anyhow
ulrica
said
lily
talked
like
a
clergyman
wie

i
don
t
know
ulrica
said
she
was
a
letter
don
t
but
she
can

read
german
or
don
t
know
ask
me
it
is
what
s
extraordinary
asked
bertha
from
the
far
side
of
jimmie
petite
and
that
what
did
the
kiddy
oh
my
dear
don
t
ask
me
to
explain
the
peculiarities
of
the
french
yes
but
all
the
letters
in
the
would
be
english
or
german
as
hendy
bertha
glanced
at
miriam
miriam
flushed
she
could
not
discuss
mademoiselle
with
two
of
the
girls
at
once
rum
go
said
bertha
you
re
right
my
son
it
s
rum
it
s
all
over
now
anyhow
there
s
no
accounting
for
tastes
poor
old
miriam
woke
in
the
moonlight
she
saw
mademoiselle
s
face
as
it
had
looked
at
pale
and
cruel
silent
and
very
old
someone
had
said
she
had
been
in
fraulein
s
room
again
all
the
afternoon
fraulein
had
spoken
to
her
once
or
twice
during
tea
she
had
answered
coolly
and
eagerly
disgusting
like
a
child
that
had
been
whipped
and
forgiven
how
could
fraulein
dare
to
forgive
anybody
she
lay
motionless
the
night
was
cool
the
screens
had
not
been
moved
she
felt
that
the
door
was
shut
after
a
while
she
began
in
imagination
a
conversation
with
eve
you
see
the
trouble
she
said
and
saw
eve
s
downcast
believing
admiring
sympathetic
face
fraulein
talked
to
me
about
manner
she
simply
wanted
me
to
grimace
know
be
like
other
eve
laughed
yes
i
you
see
well
if
you
wanted
to
stay
why
couldn
t
you
i
simply
couldn
t
you
know
how
people
but
you
can
act
so
but
you
can
t
keep
it
why
not
there
you
are
you
see
you
always
go
i
mean
i
think
it
would
be
simply
lovely
if
i
were
clever
like
you
i
should
do
it
all
the
time
be
simply
always
gushing
and
charming
then
she
reminded
eve
of
the
day
they
had
walked
up
the
lane
to
the
heath
talking
over
all
the
manners
they
would
like
to
have
and
how
sarah
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
supper
had
caricatured
the
one
they
had
chosen
of
course
you
overdid
it
she
concluded
and
eve
crimsoned
and
said
oh
yes
i
know
it
was
my
fault
but
you
could
have
begun
all
over
again
in
germany
and
been
quite
yes
i
know
i
thought
about
that
but
if
you
knew
as
much
of
the
world
as
i
do
eve
stared
showing
a
faint
resentment
miriam
thought
of
eve
s
many
suitors
of
her
six
months
betrothal
of
her
lifelong
peacemaking
her
experiment
in
being
governess
to
the
two
children
of
an
artist
a
little
boy
threatening
her
with
a
knife
yes
but
i
mean
if
you
had
been
i
know
smiled
eve
confidently
you
mean
if
i
were
you
go
on
i
know
explain
old
well
i
mean
of
course
if
you
are
a
governess
in
a
school
you
be
jolly
and
charming
you
can
t
be
idiotic
or
anything
i
did
think
about
it
don
t
tell
anybody
but
i
thought
for
a
little
while
i
might
go
into
a
family
one
of
the
girls
families
the
german
girls
and
begin
having
a
german
manner
two
of
the
girls
asked
me
one
of
them
was
ill
and
went
away
that
pomeranian
one
i
told
you
about
well
then
i
didn
t
tell
you
about
that
little
one
and
her
sister
they
asked
me
to
go
to
them
for
the
holidays
the
youngest
said
it
was
absurd
you
shall
marry
my
bruzzer
he
is
mairchant
very
welty
absurd
you
probably
have
away
from
that
d
you
think
so
yes
you
would
have
been
a
regular
german
fat
and
jolly
and
i
know
my
dear
i
thought
about
it
you
may
imagine
i
wondered
if
i
why
didn
t
you
try
why
not
why
was
she
not
going
to
try
eve
would
she
was
sure
in
her
place
why
not
grimace
and
be
very
bright
and
animated
until
the
end
of
the
term
and
then
go
and
stay
with
the
bergmanns
for
two
months
and
be
as
charming
as
she
could
her
heart
sank
she
imagined
a
house
everyone
kind
and
blond
and
smiling
emma
s
big
tall
brother
smiling
and
joking
and
liking
her
she
would
laugh
and
pretend
and
flirt
like
the
pooles
and
make
up
to
him
and
it
would
be
lovely
for
a
little
while
then
she
would
offend
someone
she
would
offend
everyone
but
emma
and
get
tired
and
cross
and
lose
her
temper
stare
at
them
all
as
they
said
the
things
everybody
said
the
things
she
hated
and
she
would
sit
glowering
and
suddenly
refuse
to
allow
the
women
to
be
familiar
with
her
she
tried
to
see
the
brother
more
clearly
she
looked
at
the
screen
the
bergmanns
house
would
be
full
of
german
furniture
at
the
end
of
a
week
every
bit
of
it
would
reproach
her
she
tried
to
imagine
him
without
the
house
and
the
family
not
talking
or
joking
or
pretending
alone
and
sad
despising
his
family
needing
her
he
loved
forests
and
music
he
had
a
great
strong
solid
voice
and
was
strong
and
sure
about
everything
and
she
need
never
worry
any
more
seit
ich
ihn
gesehen
glaub
ich
blind
zu
there
would
be
a
garden
and
german
springs
and
summers
and
sunsets
and
strong
kind
arms
and
a
shoulder
she
would
grow
so
happy
no
one
would
recognise
her
as
the
same
person
she
would
wear
a
band
of
velvet
ribbon
round
her
hair
and
look
at
the
no
good
she
could
never
get
out
to
that
never
she
could
not
pretend
long
enough
everything
would
be
at
an
end
long
before
there
was
any
chance
of
her
turning
into
a
happy
german
woman
certainly
with
a
german
man
she
would
be
angry
at
once
she
thought
of
the
men
she
had
seen
in
the
streets
in
cafes
and
gardens
the
masters
in
the
school
photographs
in
the
girls
albums
they
had
all
offended
her
at
once
something
in
their
bearing
and
manner
blind
and
impudent
she
thought
of
the
interview
she
had
witnessed
between
ulrica
and
her
cousin
the
cousin
coming
up
from
the
estate
in
erfurth
arriving
in
a
carriage
fraulein
s
manner
her
smiles
and
hints
ulrica
standing
in
the
saal
in
her
sprigged
saffron
muslin
dress
with
bent
head
the
cousin
s
condescending
laughing
voice
it
would
never
do
for
her
to
go
into
a
german
home
she
must
not
say
anything
about
the
chance
of
going
to
the
bergmanns
even
to
eve
she
imagined
eve
sitting
listening
in
the
window
space
in
the
bow
that
was
carpeted
with
linoleum
to
look
like
parquet
flooring
beyond
them
lay
the
length
of
the
turkey
carpet
darkening
away
under
the
long
and
the
large
epergne
made
her
feel
guilty
and
shifting
guilty
from
the
beginning
of
things
you
see
eve
i
thought
counting
it
all
up
that
if
i
came
home
it
would
cost
less
than
going
to
norderney
and
that
all
the
expense
of
my
going
to
germany
and
coming
back
is
less
than
what
it
would
have
cost
to
keep
me
at
home
for
the
five
months
i
ve
been
there
i
wish
you
d
tell
everybody
she
turned
about
in
bed
her
head
was
growing
fevered
she
conjured
up
a
vision
of
the
backs
of
the
books
in
the
bookcase
in
the
at
home
iliad
and
odyssey
people
going
over
the
sea
in
boats
and
someone
doing
embroidery
that
little
picture
of
hector
and
andromache
in
the
corner
of
a
page
he
in
armour
she
in
a
trailing
dress
holding
up
her
baby
both
silly
she
wished
she
had
read
more
carefully
she
could
not
remember
anything
in
lecky
or
darwin
that
would
tell
her
what
to

motley
s

of
the

and
the

of
the

she
held
to
the
memory
of
these
two
books
something
was
coming
from
them
to
her
she
handled
the
shiny
brown
back
of
motley
s
rise
and
felt
the
hard
graining
of
the
chronicles
there
were
green
trees
outside
in
the
moonlight
in
luther
s
germany
trees
and
fields
and
german
towns
and
then

she
breathed
more
easily
her
eyes
opened
serenely
tranquil
moonlight
lay
across
the
room
it
surprised
her
like
a
sudden
hand
stroking
her
brow
it
seemed
to
feel
for
her
heart
if
she
gave
way
to
it
her
thoughts
would
go
perhaps
she
ought
to
watch
it
and
let
her
thoughts
go
it
passed
over
her
trouble
like
her
mother
did
when
she
said
don

go
so
deeply
into
everything

running
quickly
downstairs
clearing
her
throat
to
sing
but
mother
did
not
know
she
had
no

power
she
could
not
help
because
she
did
not

the
moonlight
was
sad
and
hesitating
miriam
closed
her
eyes
again

pinning
up
that
notice
on

why
is
luther
like
a
dyspeptic
blackbird
because
the
diet
of
worms
did
not
agree
with
him
and
then
leaving
the

on

going
home

some

they
pinned
up
that
notice
on
a
roman
catholic
church
and
all
the
priests
looked
at
them
and
behind
the
priests
were
torture
and
dark
places
luther
looking
up
to

saying
you
couldn

your

his

perspired

wooden
german
house
and
rome
waiting
to
kill
them
darwin
had
come
since
then
there
were
people
distinguished
minds
who
thought
darwin
was
true
no
god
no
creation
the
struggle
for
existence
fighting
fighting
fighting
everybody
groping
and
fighting
fraulein
some
said
it
was
true
some
not
they
could
not
both
be
right
it
was
probably
true
only
people
thought
it
was
not
it
was
true
just
that
monkeys
fighting
but
who
began
it
who
made
fraulein
tough
leathery
monkey
then
nothing
matters
just
one
little
short
life
a
few
more
years
shall
roll
a
few
more
seasons

there
was
a
better
one
than
that
not
so
swift
to
its
close
ebbs
out
life
s
little
day
earth
s
joys
grow
dim
its
glories
fade

and
decay

around
i
brough
quoted
milton
in
a
sermon
and
said
he
was
a
materialist
pater
said
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
say
brough
was
a
man
she
couldn
t
imagine
how
he
stayed
in
the
church
she
hoped
he
hated
that
sickening
sickening
idiot
humbug
eve
meek
with
silly
long
hair
divinely
smiling
adam
was
like
a
german
english
too
impudent
bombastic
creature
a
sort
of
man
who
would
call
his
wife
my
there
was
a
hymn
that
even
pater
liked
the
tune

like

flights
of
shining
steps
shallow
and
very
wide
going
up
and
up
and
growing
fainter
and
fainter
and
far
away
at
the
top
a
faint
old
face
with
great
rays
shooting
out
all
round
it
the
picture
in
the
large
pilgrim
s
god
in
heaven
i
belong
to
apollyon
a
horror
with
expressionless
eyes
darting
out
little
spiky
flames
if
only
it
would
come
now
instead
of
waiting
until
the
end
she
clasped
her
hands
closely
one
in
the
other
they
felt
large
and
strong
she
stopped
her
thoughts
and
stared
for
a
long
while
at
the
faint
light
in
the
room
it
s
physically
impossible
someone
had
said
the
only
hell
thinkable
is
remorse
remorse
sighing
impatiently
she
turned
about
and
sighed
again
breathing
deeply
and
rattling
and
feeling
very
hungry
there
will
be
breakfast
even
for
me
if
they
knew
me
they
would
not
give
me
breakfast
no
one
would
i
should
be
in
a
little
room
and
one
after
another
would
come
and
be
reproachful
and
shocked
and
then
they
would
go
away
and
be
happy
and
forget
sarah
would
come
whatever
it
was
sarah
would
come
she
read
the
bible
and
marked
pieces
but
she
would
rush
in
without
saying
anything
with
a
red
face
and
bang
down
a
plate
of
melon
what
did
god
do
about
people
like
sarah
perhaps
apollyon
could
be
made
to
come
at
once
sweeping
in
like
a
large
bat
be
torn
to
bits
those
men
at
that
college
said
he
had
come
to
them
they
swore
one
after
the
other
and
the
devil
came
in
through
one
of
the
carved
windows
and
carried
one
of
them
away
i
have
my
doubts
pater
s
face
laughing
i
have
my
doubts
ooof
she
flung
off
the
outer
covering
and
felt
the
strong
movements
of
her
limbs
hang
hang
damn
if
there
s
no
god
there
s
no
devil
and
everything
goes
on
fraulein
goes
on
having
her
school
what
does
she
really
think
out
in
the
world
people
don
t
think
they
grimace
is
there
anywhere
where
there
are
no
people
be
a
gipsy
there
are
always
people
what
a
perfect
morning
what
a
perfect
morning
miriam
kept
telling
herself
trying
to
see
into
the
garden
there
was
a
bowl
of
irises
on
the
it
made
everything
seem
strange
there
had
never
been
flowers
on
the
table
before
there
was
also
a
great
dish
of
pumpernickel
besides
the
usual
food
fraulein
had
enjoined
silence
the
silence
made
the
impression
of
the
irises
stay
she
hoped
it
might
be
a
new
rule
she
glanced
at
fraulein
two
or
three
times
she
was
pallid
white
her
face
looked
thinner
than
usual
and
her
eyes
larger
and
keener
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
anyone
miriam
wondered
whether
she
were
thinking
about
cancer
her
face
looked
as
it
had
done
when
once
or
twice
she
had
said
ich
bin
so
bange
vor
she
hoped
not
perhaps
it
was
the
problem
of
evil
perhaps
she
had
thought
of
it
when
she
put
the
irises
on
the
table
she
gazed
at
them
the
flummery
petals
against
the
palm
of
her
hand
fraulein
seemed
cancelled
there
was
no
need
to
feel
she
was
not
thinking
of
any
of
them
miriam
found
herself
looking
at
high
grey
stone
basins
with
ornamental
stems
like
and
large
square
fluted
pedestals
filled
with
geraniums
and
calceolarias
they
had
stood
in
the
sunshine
at
the
corners
of
the
lawn
in
her
grandmother
s
garden
she
could
remember
nothing
else
but
the
scent
of
a
greenhouse
and
its
steamy
panes
over
her
head
lemon
thyme
and
scented
geranium
how
lovely
it
would
be
at
the
end
of
the
day
fraulein
would
feel
happy
then
or
did
elderly
people
fear
cancer
all
the
time
it
was
a
great
mistake
you
should
leave
things
to
nature
you
were
more
likely
to
have
things
if
you
thought
about
them
but
fraulein
would
think
and
worry
alone
with
herself
with
her
great
dark
eyes
and
bony
forehead
and
thin
pale
cheeks
always
alone
and
just
cancer
coming
i
shall
be
like
that
one
day
an
old
teacher
and
cancer
coming
it
was
silly
to
forget
all
about
it
and
see
granny
s
calceolarias
in
the
sun
all
that
had
to
come
to
an
end
to
forget
was
like
putting
off
repentance
those
who
did
not
put
it
off
saw
when
the
great
waters
came
a
shining
figure
coming
to
them
through
the
flood
if
they
did
not
they
were
like
the
man
in
a
his
mouth
hanging
open
no
teeth
and
skinny
hands
playing
cards
on
his
after
fraulein
settled
a
mending
party
at
the
of
the
schoolroom
table
she
sent
no
emissary
but
was
waiting
herself
in
the
schoolroom
when
they
came
down
she
hovered
about
putting
them
into
their
places
and
enquiring
about
the
work
of
each
one
she
arranged
miriam
and
the
germans
at
the
saal
end
of
the
table
for
an
english
lesson
mademoiselle
was
not
there
fraulein
herself
took
the
head
of
the
table
once
more
she
enjoined
silence
the
whole
table
seemed
waiting
for
miriam
to
begin
her
lesson
the
three
or
four
readings
they
had
done
during
the
term
alone
in
the
little
room
had
brought
them
through
about
a
third
of
the
volume
hoarsely
whispering
then
violently
clearing
her
throat
and
speaking
suddenly
in
a
very
loud
tone
miriam
bade
them
resume
the
story
they
read
and
she
corrected
them
in
hoarse
whispers
no
one
appeared
to
be
noticing
a
steady
breeze
coming
through
the
open
door
of
the
flowed
past
them
and
along
the
table
but
miriam
sat
stifling
with
beating
temples
she
had
no
thoughts
now
and
again
in
correcting
a
simple
word
she
was
not
sure
that
she
had
given
the
right
english
rendering
behind
her
distress
two
impressions
went
to
and
fro
fraulein
and
the
raccommodage
party
sitting
in
judgment
and
the
whole
roomful
waiting
for
cancer
very
gently
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
fraulein
dismissed
the
germans
to
practise
herr
schraub
was
coming
at
eleven
miriam
supposed
she
was
free
until
then
and
went
upstairs
on
the
landing
she
met
mademoiselle
coming
downstairs
with
mending
bossy
coming
she
said
feverishly
in
french
are
you
going
to
the
saal
mademoiselle
stood
contemplating
her
i
ve
just
been
giving
an
english
lesson
oh
mon
dieu
she
proceeded
mademoiselle
still
looked
gravely
and
quietly
miriam
was
passing
on
mademoiselle
turned
and
said
hurriedly
in
a
low
voice
elsa
says

a
fool

oh
smiled
miriam
you
think
they
do
not
speak
of

hein

jimmie
says

she
laughed
in
saying
that
gertrude
too
thinks
you
are
a
fool
oh

say
things
if
i
should
tell

said
miriam
heavily
moving
on
everyone
all
say

i
tell

whispered
mademoiselle
turning
her
head
as
she
went
on
downstairs
miriam
ran
into
the
empty
tearing
open
a
envelope
there
was
a
long
letter
from
eve
a
folded
from
mother
her
heart
beat
rapidly
thick
straight
rain
was
seething
down
into
the
garden
come

say
to
mademoiselle

she
little
mademoiselle
poor
little
beast
leaving
seems
like
it
she

been
packing

because

business
oh

some
story
of

and
mademoiselle

going
with
her
and
we
re
all
to
take
solemn
leave
and
she
s
not
coming
back
next
term
come
mademoiselle
radiantly
rosy
under
her
large
black
french
hat
wearing
her
stockinette
jacket
and
grey
dress
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
schoolroom
table
the
girls
were
all
assembled
and
the
door
into
the
hall
was
open
the
housekeeper
was
laughing
and
shouting
and
imitating
the
puffing
of
a
train
mademoiselle
stood
smiling
beside
her
with
downcast
eyes
opposite
them
was
gertrude
with
thin
white
face
blue
lips
and
hotly
blazing
eyes
fixed
on
mademoiselle
she
stood
easily
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
she
must
have
an
appalling
headache
thought
miriam
mademoiselle
began
shaking
hands
i
say
mademoiselle
began
jimmie
quietly
and
hurriedly
in
her
lame
french
as
she
took
her
hand
have
you
got
another
place
a
place
i
mean
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
term
petite
next
term
we
want
to
know
about
your
but
i
remain
now
with
my
parents
till
my
petite
fancy
never
telling
exclamations
clustered
round
from
all
over
the
room
why

i
tell
we
didn
t
even
know
you
were
engaged
but
of
course
certainly
i
marry
i
know
quite
well
who
is
to
marry
the
room
was
taking
leave
of
mademoiselle
almost
in
silence
the
english
were
standing
together
miriam
heard
their
voices
dieu
m
selle
dieu
m
selle
one
after
the
other
and
saw
hands
and
wrists
move
vigorously
up
and
down
the
germans
were
commenting
ah
she
is
engaged
ah
what
ah
the
rascal
hor
mal
miriam
dreaded
her
turn
mademoiselle
was
coming
near
so
cheap
and
with
her
hard
grey
dress
and
her
cheap
jacket
with
the
hat
hiding
her
hair
and
making
her
look
skinny
and
old
she
was
a
more
dreadful
stranger
than
she
had
been
at
first
miriam
wished
she
could
stay
she
could
not
let
anyone
go
away
like
this
they
would
not
meet
again
and
mademoiselle
was
going
away
detesting
her
and
them
all
going
away
in
disgrace
and
not
minding
and
going
to
be
married
all
the
time
there
had
been
that
waiting
for
her
she
was
smiling
now
and
showing
her
babyish
teeth
how
could
jimmie
hold
her
by
the
shoulders
venez
mon
enfant
venez
a
l
instant
called
fraulein
from
the
hall
mademoiselle
made
her
hard
little
sound
with
her
throat
why
doesn
t
she
go
thought
miriam
as
mademoiselle
ran
down
the
room
adieu
adieu
evaireeboddie
alla
are
all
here
jimmie
answered
and
fraulein
came
to
the
table
and
stood
leaning
for
a
moment
upon
one
hand
the
door
opened
and
the
housekeeper
shone
hard
and
bright
in
the
doorway
wasche
angekommen
na
gut
responded
fraulein
quietly
the
housekeeper
disappeared
fraulein
looks
like
a
dead
body
thought
miriam
apprehension
overtook
her
there
s
going
to
be
some
silly
i
shall
speak
in
english
because
the
most
that
i
shall
say
concerns
the
english
members
of
this
household
and
its
heavy
seriousness
will
be
by
those
who
are
not
english
sufficiently
miriam
flushed
struggling
for
she
determined
not
to
listen
damn
devil
she
exhorted
herself
humbugging
creature
she
felt
the
blood
throbbing
in
her
face
and
her
eyes
and
looked
at
no
one
she
was
conscious
that
little
movements
and
sounds
came
from
the
germans
but
she
heard
nothing
but
fraulein
s
voice
which
had
ceased
it
had
been
the
tone
she
used
at
prayers
oh
lord
bother
damnation
she
reiterated
in
her
discomfiture
the
words
echoing
through
her
mind
seemed
to
cut
a
way
of
escape
that
dear
child
smiled
fraulein
s
voice
who
has
just
left
us
came
under
this
roof
nearly
a
year
ago
she
came
a
tender
girl
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
oh
goodness
from
the
house
of
her
pious
parents
fromme
eltern
fromme
fraulein
breathed
these
words
slowly
out
and
a
deep
sigh
came
from
one
of
the
germans
to
reside
with
us
she
came
in
the
most
perfect
confidence
with
the
aim
to
complete
her
own
simple
education
the
pious
and
simple
nurture
of
a
protestant
french
girl
and
with
the
aim
also
to
remove
for
a
period
something
of
the
burden
lying
upon
the
shoulders
of
those
dear
parents
in
the
upbringing
of
herself
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
and
then
to
leave
home
and
be
married
how
easy
how
easy
honourably
honourably
she
has
fulfilled
each
and
every
duty
laid
upon
her
as
institutrice
in
this
establishment
sufficient
to
indicate
this
fulfilment
of
duty
is
the
fact
that
she
was
happy
and
that
she
made
happy
others
fraulein
s
voice
dropped
to
its
lowest
note
and
grew
fuller
in
tone
would
that
i
could
here
complete
what
i
have
to
say
of
the
sojourn
of
little
aline
ducorroy
under
this
roof
but
that
i
can
not
do
that
i
can
not
do
it
has
been
the
experience
of
this
pure
and
gentle
soul
to
come
under
this
roof
in
contact
with
things
not
fraulein
s
voice
had
become
breathless
and
shaking
both
her
hands
sought
the
support
of
the
table
this
poor
child
has
had
unwillingly
to
suffer
the
fact
of
associating
with
those
not
ach
fraulein
what
you
say
ejaculated
clara
in
the
silence
the
leaves
of
the
chestnut
tree
tapped
one
against
the
other
miriam
listened
to
them
there
must
be
a
little
breeze
blowing
across
the
garden
why
had
she
not
noticed
it
before
were
they
all
hearing
it
with
those
not
here
in
this
my
miriam
s
heart
began
to
beat
angrily
she
has
been
forced
here
in
this
school
to
hear
talking
fraulein
s
voice
thickened
of
men
manner
geschichten
here
manner
fraulein
s
voice
rang
out
down
the
table
she
bent
forward
so
that
the
light
from
both
the
windows
behind
her
fell
sharply
across
her
shoulders
and
along
the
top
of
her
head
there
was
no
condemnation
miriam
felt
in
those
broad
grey
shoulders
they
were
innocent
but
the
head
shining
and
flat
the
wide
parting
the
sleekness
of
the
hair
falling
thinly
and
flatly
away
from
it
angry
dreadful
skull
she
writhed
away
from
it
she
would
not
look
any
more
she
felt
her
neck
was
swelling
her
fraulein
whispered
low
here
in
my
school
here
standing
round
this
table
are
those
who
talk
of
men
young
girls
who
talk
of
while
fraulein
waited
trembling
several
of
the
girls
began
to
snuffle
and
sob
is
there
can
there
be
in
the
world
anything
that
is
more
base
more
vile
more
impure
is
there
is

miriam
wished
she
knew
who
was
crying
she
tried
to
fix
her
thoughts
on
a
hole
in
the
it
could
be
darned
it
could
he
you
are
brought
here
together
each
and
all
of
you
here
together
in
the
time
of
your
youth
it
is
it
should
be
for
you
the
most
beautiful
occasion
can
you
find
anything
more
terrible
than
that
such
occasion
where
all
may
work
and
influence
each
other
for
all
life
in
purity
and
goodness
that
such
occasion
should
be
used
impurely
like
a
dawn
like
a
dawn
for
purity
should
be
the
life
of
a
maiden
calm
and
pure
and
with
holy
miriam
repeated
these
words
in
her
mind
trying
to
dwell
on
the
beauty
of
fraulein
s
middle
tones
and
the
day
shall
come
i
shall
wish
for
all
of
you
that
the
sanctity
of
a
home
shall
be
within
your
hands
what
then
shall
be
the
shame
what
the
regret
of
those
who
before
the
coming
of
that
sacred
time
did
think
thoughts
of
men
did
speak
of
them
shame
whispered
fraulein
amidst
the
sobbing
girls
with
the
thoughts
of
those
who
have
this
impure
nature
i
can
do
nothing
for
them
it
is
freely
to
acknowledge
this
evil
in
the
heart
and
to
pray
that
the
heart
may
be
changed
and
made
clean
but
a
thing
i
can
do
and
i
do
i
will
have
no
more
of
this
talking
in
my
school
i
will
have
no
more
do
you
hear
all
do
you
hear
she
struck
the
table
with
both
fists
and
brandished
them
in
she
sneered
i
know
know
who
are
the
culprits
i
have
always
she
gasped
it
shall
cease
these
talks
this
vile
talk
of
men
do
you
understand
it
shall
cease
i
will
not
have
it
the
school
shall
be
clean
from
pupil
to
pupil
from
room
to
room
every
day
every
hour
shameless
she
screamed
shameless
ah
i
know
i
know
she
stood
with
her
arms
folded
swaying
and
gave
a
little
laugh
you
think
to
deceive
me
you
do
not
deceive
me
i
know
i
have
known
and
i
shall
know
this
school
is
mine
mine
my
place
i
will
have
it
as
i
will
have
it
that
is
clear
and
plain
and
you
all
shall
help
me
i
shall
say
no
more
but
i
shall
know
what
to
mechanically
miriam
went
downstairs
with
the
rest
of
the
party
with
the
full
force
of
her
nerves
she
resisted
the
echoes
of
fraulein
s
onslaught
refusing
to
think
of
anything
she
had
said
and
blotting
out
her
image
every
time
it
rose
the
essential
was
that
she
would
be
dismissed
as
mademoiselle
had
been
dismissed
that
was
the
upshot
of
it
all
for
her
fraulein
was
a
mad
silly
pious
female
who
would
send
her
away
and
go
on
glowering
over
the
bible
she
would
have
to
go
go
in
a
sort
of
disgrace
the
girls
were
talking
all
round
her
excitedly
she
despised
them
for
showing
that
they
were
disturbed
by
fraulein
s
despotic
nonsense
as
they
reached
the
basement
she
remembered
the
letter
crushed
in
her
hand
and
sat
down
on
the
last
step
to
glance
through
it
dearest
mim
i
have
a
wonderful
piece
of
news
for
you
i
wonder
what
you
will
say
it
is
about
harriett
she
has
asked
me
to
tell
you
as
she
does
not
like
to
write
about
it
with
steady
hands
miriam
turned
the
sheets
reading
a
phrase
here
and
there
regularly
in
the
seat
behind
us
at
all
saints
for
months
saw
her
with
the
pooles
at
a
concert
at
the
assembly
rooms
and
made
up
his
mind
then
the
moment
he
saw
her
joined
the
they
won
the
double
handicap
a
beautiful
slazenger
racquet
only
just
over
sixteen
for
years
of
course
mother
says
it
s
just
a
little
foolish
nonsense
but
i
am
not
sure
that
she
really
thinks
so
gerald
took
me
into
his
confidence
made
a
solemn
call
suited
to
each
other
rather
a
long
melancholy
face
they
look
such
a
contrast
the
big
canadian
railway
not
exactly
a
clerk
something
rather
above
that
to
do
with
making
drafts
of
things
and
so
on
very
sweet
and
charming
my
own
young
days
that
i
have
reached
the
great
age
of
resident
post
in
the
country
two
little
girls
we
think
it
very
good
pay
i
shall
go
in
september
plenty
of
time
that
you
should
come
home
for
the
long
holidays
we
are
all
looking
forward
to
it
the
your
name
as
a
holiday
member
the
american
tournament
in
august
harry
was
the
youngest
lady
member
like
you
of
course
harry
could
not
let
you
come
without
knowing
find
somebody
travelling
through
fraulein
pfaff
expect
to
see
you
looking
like
a
with
a
string
tied
round
its
waist
all
the
dwarf
roses
in
bloom
hardly
any
strawberries
we
shall
see
you
soon
everybody
miriam
got
up
and
swung
the
letter
above
her
head
like
a
she
looked
about
her
like
a
stranger
everything
was
as
it
had
been
the
day
she
came
the
little
cramped
basement
hall
the
strange
german
girls
small
and
old
looking
poking
about
amongst
the
baskets
she
hardly
knew
them
she
passed
amongst
them
with
her
eyes
wide
the
little
seemed
full
of
bright
light
she
saw
everyone
at
once
clearly
all
the
english
girls
were
there
she
knew
every
line
of
each
of
them
they
were
her
old
friends
they
knew
her
looking
at
none
of
them
she
felt
she
embraced
them
all
closely
and
that
they
knew
it
they
shone
they
were
beautiful
she
wanted
to
cry
aloud
she
was
english
and
free
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
german
school
baskets
at
her
feet
made
her
pick
her
way
solomon
was
kneeling
at
one
sorting
and
handing
out
at
a
little
table
under
the
window
millie
stood
jotting
pencil
notes
on
a
judy
was
at
her
side
the
others
were
grouped
about
the
piano
gertrude
sat
on
the
keyboard
her
legs
dangling
miriam
plumped
down
on
a
full
basket
hullo
hendy
old
chap
look
all
right
miriam
looked
fearlessly
up
at
the
faces
that
were
turned
towards
her
again
she
seemed
to
see
all
of
them
at
once
the
circle
of
her
vision
seemed
huge
it
was
as
if
the
confining
rim
of
her
glasses
were
gone
and
she
saw
equally
from
eyes
that
seemed
to
fill
her
face
she
drew
all
their
eyes
to
her
they
were
waiting
for
her
to
speak
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
they
stood
there
lifeless
she
had
drawn
all
their
meaning
and
all
their
happiness
into
herself
she
could
do
as
she
wished
with
them
their
poor
little
lives
they
stood
waiting
for
some
word
from
her
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
caught
the
flash
of
gertrude
s
swinging
steel
buckles
wasn
t
fraulein
angry
she
said
carelessly
someone
pushed
the
door
to
sly
old
fancy

miriam
i

and

looked

her
little
plaintive
frown
miriam

her
pout
and
her
slightly
raised
eyebrows
at
the
frosted
window

the
school
for
the
holidays

miriam
gazing
at
her
so
would
i
any
mortal
millie
s
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
then
why
don
t
ye

said
judy
with
gentle
gruffness
the
house
was
shut
up
for
the
night
miriam
looked
up
at
the
clock
dizzily
as
she
drank
the
last
of
her
coffee
it
marked
eleven
fraulein
had
told
her
to
be
ready
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
her
hands
felt
large
and
shaky
and
her
feet
were
cold
the
room
was
stifling
bare
and
brown
in
the
gaslight
she
left
it
and
crept
through
the
hall
where
her
trunk
stood
and
up
the
creaking
stairs
she
turned
up
the
gas
emma
lay
asleep
with
red
eyelids
and
cheeks
miriam
did
not
look
at
ulrica
hurriedly
and
desolately
she
packed
her
bag
she
was
going
home
she
had
achieved
nothing
fraulein
had
made
not
the
slightest
effort
to
keep
her
she
was
just
nothing
again
with
her
saratoga
trunk
and
her
harriett
had
achieved
harriett
she
was
just
going
home
with
nothing
to
say
for
herself
the
carriage
is
here
my
child
make
miriam
pushed
things
hurriedly
into
her
bag
fraulein
had
gone
downstairs
she
was
ready
she
looked
numbly
round
the
room
emma
looked
very
far
away
she
turned
out
the
gas
the
dim
light
from
the
landing
shone
into
the
room
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
looking
back
the
room
seemed
to
be
empty
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
in
it
but
the
black
screen
standing
round
the
bed
that
was
no
longer
hers
she
murmured
and
hurried
downstairs
in
the
hall
fraulein
began
to
talk
at
once
talking
until
they
were
seated
side
by
side
in
the
dark
cab
then
miriam
gazed
freely
at
the
pale
profile
shining
at
her
side
poor
fraulein
pfaff
getting
old
fraulein
began
to
ask
about
miriam
s
plans
for
the
future
miriam
answered
as
to
an
equal
elaborating
a
little
account
of
circumstances
at
home
and
the
doings
of
her
sisters
as
she
spoke
she
felt
that
fraulein
envied
her
her
youth
and
her
family
at
home
in
england
and
she
raised
her
voice
a
little
and
laughed
easily
and
moved
crossing
her
knees
in
the
cab
she
used
sentimental
german
words
about
harriett
a
description
of
her
that
might
have
applied
to
emma
little
emphatic
tender
epithets
came
to
her
from
the
conversations
of
the
girls
fraulein
praised
her
german
warmly
and
asked
question
after
question
about
the
house
and
garden
at
barnes
and
presently
of
her
mother
i
can
t
talk
about
her
said
miriam
shortly
that
is
english
murmured
fraulein
she
s
such
a
little
thing
said
miriam
smaller
than
any
of
presently
fraulein
laid
her
gloved
hand
on
miriam
s
gloved
one
you
and
i
have
i
think
much
in
miriam
froze
and
looked
at
the
slowly
swinging
by
along
the
boulevard
much
will
have
happened
in
england
whilst
you
have
been
here
with
us
said
fraulein
eagerly
they
reached
a
street
shuttered
darkness
where
the
shops
were
and
here
and
there
the
yellow
flare
of
a
cafe
she
strained
her
eyes
to
see
the
faces
and
forms
of
men
and
women
breathing
more
quickly
as
she
watched
the
characteristic
german
gait
there
was
the
station
her
trunk
was
weighed
and
registered
there
was
something
to
pay
she
handed
her
purse
to
fraulein
and
stood
gazing
at
the
uniformed
man
ruddy
and
clear
hard
blue
eyes
and
hard
clean
clear
yellow
moustaches
decisive
untroubled
movements
passengers
were
walking
briskly
about
and
laughing
and
shouting
remarks
to
each
other
the
train
stood
waiting
for
her
the
ringing
of
an
enormous
bell
brought
her
hands
to
her
ears
fraulein
gently
propelled
her
up
the
three
steps
into
a
compartment
marked
damen
coupe
it
smelt
of
biscuits
and
wine
a
man
with
a
booming
voice
came
to
examine
her
ticket
he
stood
bending
under
the
central
light
uttering
sturdy
german
words
miriam
drank
them
in
without
understanding
he
left
the
carriage
very
empty
the
great
bell
was
ringing
again
fraulein
standing
on
the
top
step
pressed
both
her
hands
and
murmured
words
of
farewell
leb
wohl
mein
kind
gott
segne
fraulein
she
said
stiffly
shaking
hands
the
door
was
shut
with
a
slam
the
light
seemed
to
go
down
miriam
glanced
at
it
half
the
dull
green
muslin
shade
had
slipped
over
the
the
carriage
seemed
dark
the
platform
outside
was
very
bright
fraulein
had
disappeared
the
train
was
high
above
the
platform
politely
smiling
miriam
scrambled
to
the
window
the
platform
was
moving
the
large
bright
station
moving
away
fraulein
s
wide
smile
was
creasing
and
caverning
under
her
hat
from
which
the
veil
was
thrown
back
standing
at
the
window
miriam
smiled
sharply
fraulein
s
form
flowed
slowly
away
with
the
platform
groups
passed
by
smiling
and
waving
miriam
sat
down
she
leaped
up
to
lean
from
the
window
the
platform
had
disappeared
