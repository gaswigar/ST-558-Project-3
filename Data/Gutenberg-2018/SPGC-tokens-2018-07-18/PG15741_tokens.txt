chapter
i
the
invitations
are
sent
down
the
long
avenue
that
led
from
the
house
to
the
great
entrance
gate
came
the
little
colonel
on
her
pony
it
was
a
sweet
white
way
that
morning
filled
with
the
breath
of
the
locusts
white
overhead
where
the
giant
trees
locked
branches
to
make
an
arch
of
bloom
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
and
white
underneath
where
the
fallen
blossoms
lay
like
scattered
snowflakes
along
the
path
everybody
in
lloydsboro
valley
knew
locust
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
places
in
all
kentucky
they
were
fond
of
saying
and
every
visitor
to
the
valley
was
taken
past
the
great
entrance
gate
to
admire
the
long
rows
of
stately
old
trees
and
the
great
stone
house
at
the
end
whose
pillars
gleamed
white
through
the
virginia
creeper
that
nearly
covered
it
everybody
knew
old
colonel
lloyd
too
the
owner
of
the
place
he
also
was
often
pointed
out
to
the
summer
visitors
some
people
called
attention
to
him
because
he
was
an
old
confederate
soldier
who
had
given
his
good
right
arm
to
the
cause
he
loved
some
because
they
thought
he
resembled
napoleon
and
others
because
they
had
some
amusing
tale
to
tell
of
the
eccentric
things
he
had
said
or
done
nearly
every
one
who
pointed
out
the
imposing
figure
which
was
clad
always
in
white
duck
or
linen
in
the
summer
and
wrapped
in
a
picturesque
military
cape
in
winter
added
the
remark
and
he
is
the
little
colonel
grandfather
to
be
the
grandfather
of
such
an
attractive
little
bunch
of
mischief
as
lloyd
sherman
was
when
she
first
came
to
the
valley
was
a
distinction
of
which
any
man
might
well
be
proud
and
colonel
lloyd
proud
of
it
he
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
she
had
inherited
his
lordly
manner
his
hot
temper
and
imperious
ways
it
pleased
him
that
people
had
given
her
his
title
of
colonel
on
account
of
the
resemblance
to
himself
she
had
outgrown
it
somewhat
since
she
had
first
been
nicknamed
the
little
colonel
then
she
was
only
a
spoiled
baby
of
five
but
now
his
pride
in
her
was
even
greater
since
she
had
grown
into
a
womanly
little
maid
of
eleven
he
was
proud
of
her
delicate
beauty
of
her
dainty
ways
and
all
her
little
schoolgirl
accomplishments
she
is
like
those
who
have
gone
before
he
used
to
say
to
himself
sometimes
pacing
slowly
back
and
forth
under
the
locusts
and
the
branches
above
would
nod
to
each
other
as
if
they
understood
they
whispered
in
the
soft
lisping
language
of
the
leaves
know
she
like
amanthis
and
we
were
here
when
you
brought
her
home
a
bride
she
like
amanthis
like
amanthis
under
the
blossoms
rode
the
little
colonel
all
in
white
herself
this
may
morning
except
the
little
napoleon
hat
of
black
velvet
set
jauntily
over
her
short
light
hair
into
the
cockade
she
had
stuck
a
spray
of
locust
blossoms
and
as
she
rode
slowly
along
she
fastened
a
bunch
of
them
behind
each
ear
of
her
pony
whose
coat
was
as
soft
and
black
as
the
velvet
of
her
hat
tarbaby
she
called
him
partly
because
he
was
so
black
and
partly
because
that
was
the
name
of
her
favourite
uncle
remus
story
there
she
exclaimed
when
the
flowers
were
fastened
to
her
satisfaction
yo
lookin
mighty
fine
this
mawnin
tarbaby
maybe
take
you
visitin
aftah
i
been
to
the
and
mailed
these
lettahs
you
did
know
that
judge
moore
place
is
open
for
the
summah
did
you
and
that
all
the
family
came
out
well
they
did
and
if
bobby
moore
is
ovah
to
my
house
by
the
time
we
get
back
home
we
go
ovah
to
bobby
as
she
spoke
she
passed
through
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
and
turned
into
the
public
road
a
wide
pike
with
a
railroad
track
on
one
side
of
it
and
a
on
the
other
two
minutes
brisk
canter
brought
her
to
another
gate
one
that
had
been
closed
all
winter
and
one
that
she
was
greatly
interested
in
because
it
led
to
judge
house
judge
moore
was
rob
grandfather
and
she
and
rob
had
played
together
every
summer
since
she
could
remember
the
wide
white
gate
was
standing
open
now
and
she
drew
rein
peering
anxiously
in
she
hoped
for
the
sight
of
a
familiar
freckled
face
or
the
sound
of
a
welcoming
whoop
but
it
was
so
still
everywhere
that
all
she
saw
was
the
squirrels
playing
hide
and
seek
in
the
around
the
house
and
all
she
heard
was
the
fearless
cry
pewee
pewee
of
a
little
bird
perched
in
a
tree
overarching
the
gate
it
balanced
itself
on
the
limb
leaning
over
and
cocking
its
bright
eyes
at
her
as
if
admiring
the
sight
what
it
saw
was
a
slender
girl
of
eleven
taller
than
most
children
of
that
age
and
more
graceful
there
was
a
colour
in
her
cheek
like
the
delicate
pink
of
a
wild
rose
and
the
big
hazel
eyes
had
a
roguish
twinkle
in
them
as
they
looked
out
fearlessly
on
the
world
from
under
the
little
napoleon
hat
with
its
nodding
cockade
of
locust
blossoms
there
nobody
in
sight
tarbaby
said
the
little
colonel
and
there
is
time
to
go
in
befo
we
been
to
the
so
we
might
as
well
be
travellin
on
she
was
turning
slowly
away
when
down
the
pike
behind
her
came
the
quick
beat
of
a
horse
hoofs
and
a
shrill
whistle
a
boy
was
riding
toward
her
as
fast
as
his
big
gray
horse
could
carry
him
he
was
riding
bareback
straight
and
lithe
as
a
young
indian
his
cap
pushed
to
the
back
of
his
head
he
snatched
it
off
with
a
flourish
as
he
came
within
speaking
distance
of
the
little
colonel
his
freckled
face
all
ashine
with
pleasure
hello
lloyd
he
called
i
was
just
going
to
your
house
and
i
was
looking
for
you
bobby
she
answered
as
informally
as
if
it
were
only
yesterday
they
had
parted
instead
of
eight
months
before
come
and
go
down
to
the
with
me
i
must
take
these
lettahs
all
right
said
rob
wheeling
the
gray
horse
around
beside
the
black
pony
and
smiling
broadly
as
he
looked
down
into
the
little
welcoming
eyes
you
do
know
how
good
it
feels
to
get
back
to
the
country
again
lloyd
i
could
hardly
wait
for
school
to
close
when
think
about
the
fish
waiting
for
me
out
here
in
the
creek
and
the
wild
strawberries
getting
ripe
and
the
horses
just
spoiling
to
be
exercised
it
was
more
than
i
could
stand
what
have
you
been
doing
all
winter
oh
the
same
old
things
school
and
music
lessons
and
good
times
in
the
evenin
with
mothah
and
papa
jack
and
grandfathah
as
they
jogged
along
side
by
side
the
little
colonel
chatting
gaily
of
all
that
had
happened
since
their
last
meeting
rob
kept
casting
curious
glances
at
her
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
lloyd
sherman
he
demanded
finally
you
look
so
so
there
was
such
a
puzzled
expression
in
his
sharp
gray
eyes
that
the
little
colonel
laughed
then
her
hand
flew
up
to
her
head
do
you
see
i
had
my
hair
cut
i
had
to
beg
and
beg
befo
mothah
and
papa
jack
would
let
me
have
it
done
but
it
was
so
long
away
below
my
waist
and
a
bothah
it
had
to
be
brushed
and
plaited
a
dozen
times
a
day
i
do
like
it
that
way
it
is
a
bit
becoming
said
rob
with
the
frankness
of
old
comradeship
you
look
like
a
boy
why
it
is
as
short
as
mine
i
do
care
answered
lloyd
her
eyes
flashing
dangerously
comfortable
this
way
and
grandfathah
likes
it
he
says
he
got
his
little
colonel
back
again
now
and
he
sent
to
town
for
this
napoleon
hat
like
the
ones
i
used
to
weah
when
i
was
a
little
thing
when
you
were
a
little
thing
laughed
rob
teasingly
what
do
you
think

missy
you
head
and
shoulders
shorter
than
i
am
i
eleven
yeahs
old

moore
answered
the
little
colonel
with
such
dignity
that
rob
wished

spoken
i

eleven
last
week
that
was
one
of
my
birthday

my

way
about

good
time
bobby
rob
whirled
his
cap
around
his
head
with
a
jolly
for
you
before
he
answered
more
politely
thank
you
lloyd
you
can
count
on
me
for
my
part
i
be
on
hand
every
time
you
turn
around
if
you
want
me
who
all
coming
for
answer
lloyd
held
up
the
three
letters
she
was
carrying
and
let
him
see
the
first
address
written
in
sherman
flowing
hand
eugenia
forbes
york
well
who
is
she
he
asked
reading
it
aloud
eugenia
is
a
sort
of
cousin
of
mine
explained
lloyd
at
least
her
fathah
and
my
fathah
are
related
in
some
way
i
used
to
know
her
when
we
lived
in
new
york
but
i
have
seen
her
since
we
left
i
was
five
then
and
she
was
seven
so
she
must
be
neahly
thirteen
yeahs
old
now
when
we
played
togethah
she
would
scream
and
if
i
did
give
up
to
her
in
everything
and
as
i
had
a
bad
tempah
too
we
were
always
fussin
she
was
dreadfully
spoiled
i
nevah
how
my
hand
bled
one
day
when
she
bit
it
or
how
she
clawed
my
face
till
it
looked
as
if
a
tigah
had
scratched
it
then
what
did
you
do
asked
rob
with
a
grin
he
had
experimented
with
lloyd
temper
himself
in
the
past
i
believe
that
that
was
the
time
i
pounded
her
on
the
back
with
my
little
red
chair
answered
lloyd
laughing
at
the
recollection
or
maybe
it
was
the
time
i
banged
her
ovah
the
head
with
a
toy
teakettle
i
remembah
i
did
both
those
bad
things
and
that
we
were
always
in
trouble
whenevah
we
were
togethah
i
did
want
mothah
to
invite
her
but
she
said
she
felt
that
we
ought
to
eugenia
mothah
is
dead
she
died
three
yeahs
ago
and
since
then
she
been
kept
in
a
school
most
of
the
time
when
she
not
away
at
school
she
stays
in
some
big
hotel
with
her
fathah
eithah
in
new
york
or
at
some
summah
resort
he
is
always
so
busy
there
no
one
to
pay
any
attention
to
her
but
her
maid
they
are
very
wealthy
and
eugenia
has
had
the
best
of
everything
so
long
that
i
afraid
she
find
the
valley
dreadfully
poah
and
poky
i
imagine
she
stuck
up
too
she
used
to
be
and
she
always
had
her
own
way
about
everything
number
one
does
sound
very
inviting
said
rob
with
a
sour
grimace
who
is
your
number
two
lloyd
held
out
the
second
envelope
joyce
ware
plainsville
i
nevah
saw
her
said
lloyd
but
i
feel
as
if
we
had
always
been
old
friends
her
mothah
and
mine
used
to
go
to
school
togethah
heah
in
lloydsboro
valley
at
the
girls
college
and
they
written
to
each
othah
once
a
month
for
fifteen
yeahs
ware
is
a
widow
now
and
they
have
ha
times
for
they
are
poah
and
she
has
foah
children
youngah
than
joyce
but
joyce
has
had
lots
of
things
that
neithah
eugenia
nor
i
have
had
last
yeah
her
cousin
kate
took
her
abroad
with
her
and
she
studied
french
and
she
had
lots
of
beautiful
times
where
they
spent
the
wintah
in
france
ware
sent
some
of
the
lettahs
to
mothah
that
joyce
wrote
one
was
about
a
christmas
tree
that
they
gave
to
thirty
little
peasant
children
and
so
many
queer
things
happened
behind
a
gate
that
they
called
the
of
the
giant
scissahs
because
there
was
a
pair
of
enormous
scissahs
hanging
ovah
it
you
know
oh
it
was
just
like
a
fairy
tale
all
the
things
that
joyce
did
when
she
was
in
touraine
how
old
is
she
interrupted
rob
just
eugenia
age
i
believe
and
she
must
be
an
interestin
sort
of
girl
for
she
draws
beautifully
mothah
says
that
her
sketches
are
fine
and
that
joyce
will
be
a
real
artist
when
she
is
grown
number
two
is
all
right
said
rob
with
an
approving
nod
next
the
little
colonel
held
out
the
third
envelope
one
flew
east
and
one
flew
west
so
i
this
will
fly
into
the
cuckoo
nest
said
rob
as
he
read
the
address
elizabeth
lloyd
lewis
jaynes
why
that
just
what
mothah
calls
the
place
cried
the
little
colonel

the
way

builds
its
nest

weave
a
few
twigs

of
way
and
nevah

a
bit
if

poah
little
young

nest
they
seem
to
think
that

is
the
kind
of
a
home

the
little
black
pony
was
off
like
an
arrow
toward
locust
with
the
big
gray
horse
thundering
hard
at
its
heels
the
dust
flew
dogs
barked
and
chickens
ran
squawking
across
the
road
out
of
the
way
heads
were
thrust
out
of
the
windows
as
the
two
vanished
up
the
dusty
pike
and
an
old
graybeard
loafing
in
front
of
the
corner
grocery
gave
an
amused
chuckle
beats
all
how
them
two
do
get
over
the
ground
he
said
they
ride
like
tarn
and
i
bet
a
quarter
there
nothing
on
earth
that
either
of
are
afraid
of
a
little
while
later
the
three
white
envelopes
were
jogging
sociably
along
side
by
side
in
a
on
their
way
to
louisville
but
their
course
did
not
lie
together
long
in
the
city
they
were
separated
and
sent
on
their
different
ways
like
three
white
to
bid
the
guests
make
ready
for
the
little
house
party
chapter
ii
one
flew
into
the
cuckoo
nest
the
letter
for
jaynes
reached
the
end
of
its
journey
first
it
was
much
of
a
only
an
old
case
of
set
up
in
one
corner
of
a
store
a
man
riding
over
from
the
nearest
town
twice
a
week
brought
the
on
horseback
so
few
letters
found
their
way
into
this
particular
bag
that
squire
jaynes
who
kept
the
store
and
felt
a
personal
interest
in
every
envelope
that
passed
through
his
hands
miss
elizabeth
lloyd
lewis
he
spelled
aloud
examining
the
address
through
his
spectacles
with
a
critical
squint
now
who
under
the
canopy
might
be
there
was
no
one
in
the
store
to
answer
the
question
but
an
overgrown
boy
who
had
stopped
to
get
his
father
weekly
paper
he
sat
on
the
counter
dangling
his
big
bare
feet
against
a
and
catching
flies
in
his
sunburned
hands
while
he
waited
for
the
mail
to
be
opened
the
squire
peered
inquiringly
at
him
over
the
spectacles
jake
he
asked
ever
hear
tell
of
a
miss
elizabeth
lloyd
lewis
up
this
way
wy
sure
drawled
the
boy
that
betty
the
appletons
betty
you
know
she
that
little
orphan
they
up
i
worked
there
a
while
this
spring
hump
grunted
the
squire
slipping
the
letter
into
the
marked
a
if

it
is
i

all
about
her
precious
little
bringing

very
near
after
all
fourth
or
fifth
cousins
to
her
father
or
something
like
that
they
all

and
her
father
made
some
arrangement
with
them
before
he
died
left
a
little
money
to
pay
her
board
they
say
but
i
heard
she
works
just
the
same
as
if
she
was
living
on
charity
that
the
truth
said
jake
she
does
talk
about
bringin
up
she
does
get
any
of
it
appleton
has
her
hands
so
full
of
for
farm
hands
and
all
that

tend
to
her
own
children

alone

else
it
betty
that
to
be
bringin
up
the
little
appletons
i
glad
there
somebody
takes
enough
interest
in
the
child
to
write
to
her
continued
the
gossipy
old
squire
who
often
talked
to
himself
when
he
could
find
no
other
audience
i
wonder
who
it
is
lloydsboro
valley
it
postmarked
wish
she
happen
down
here
i
ask
her
who
it
from
jake
got
up
dragged
his
bare
feet
across
the
floor
and
leaned
lazily
on
the
counter
as
he
reached
for
his
paper
little
betty
will
be
mighty
proud
to
get
a
real
shore
letter
all
for
herself
i
never
got
one
in
my
life
i
take
it
up
to
her
squire
if
you
say
so
i
goin
by
the
appletons
on
my
way
home
reckon
you
might
as
well
answered
the
old
man
giving
a
final
close
scrutiny
before
handing
it
to
the
boy
it
might
lie
here
all
week
in
case
none
of
them
happened
to
come
to
the
store
and
it
looks
as
if
it
might
be
important
jake
slipped
the
letter
into
the
band
of
his
straw
hat
and
slouched
lazily
out
of
the
store
an
old
sorrel
horse
whinnied
as
he
stepped
up
to
untie
it
jake
mounted
and
rode
off
slowly
his
bare
feet
dangling
far
below
the
stirrups
it
was
two
miles
to
the
appleton
farm
down
a
hot
dusty
road
and
he
took
his
time
in
going
well
for
little
betty
that
she
did
not
know
what
wonderful
surprise
was
on
its
way
to
her
or
she
would
have
been
in
a
fever
of
impatience
for
the
letter
to
arrive
it
had
been
a
tiresome
day
for
the
child
up
before
five
in
her
bare
little
room
in
the
west
gable
busy
with
morning
chores
until
breakfast
was
ready
she
had
earned
a
rest
long
before
the
little
colonel
day
had
begun
afterward
she
had
helped
with
the
breakfast
dishes
and
had
taken
her
turn
at
the
in
the
thumping
the
heavy
dasher
up
and
down
in
the
cedar
churn
until
her
arms
ached
but
it
was
cool
and
pleasant
down
in
the
with
the
water
trickling
out
in
a
ceaseless
on
the
cold
stones
she
dabbled
her
fingers
in
the
spring
for
a
long
time
when
the
churning
was
done
wishing
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
sit
there
and
listen
to
the
secrets
it
was
trying
to
tell
surely
it
must
have
learned
a
great
many
on
its
underground
way
among
the
roots
of
things
and
all
else
that
lies
hidden
in
the
earth
but
she
could
not
loiter
long
there
was
the
to
set
for
the
hungry
and
after
the
dinner
was
over
more
dishes
to
then
there
were
some
towels
to
iron
it
was
two
before
her
work
was
all
done
and
she
had
time
to
go
up
to
her
little
room
in
the
west
gable
the
sun
poured
in
through
the
shutterless
windows
so
fiercely
that
she
did
not
stay
long
only
long
enough
to
put
on
a
clean
apron
and
brush
her
curly
hair
as
she
stood
in
front
of
the
little
it
was
such
a
tiny
mirror
that
she
could
see
only
a
part
of
her
face
at
a
time
when
her
big
brown
eyes
wistful
and
questioning
as
a
fawn
were
reflected
in
it
there
was
no
room
for
the
sensitive
little
mouth
or
if
she
stood
on
tiptoe
so
that
she
could
see
her
plump
round
chin
dimpled
cheeks
and
white
teeth
the
eyes
were
left
out
and
she
could
see
no
more
of
her
inquisitive
little
nose
than
lay
below
the
big
freckle
in
the
middle
of
it
hastily
tying
back
her
curls
with
a
bow
of
brown
ribbon
she
slipped
on
her
apron
and
ran
buttoning
it
as
she
went
she
was
free
now
to
do
as
she
pleased
until
once
out
of
the
house
she
walked
slowly
along
through
the
shady
orchard
swinging
her
sunbonnet
by
the
strings
after
the
orchard
came
the
long
leafy
lane
with
its
double
rows
of
and
then
the
gate
at
the
end
leading
into
the
public
highway
as
she
slipped
her
hand
around
the
post
to
unfasten
the
chain
that
held
the
gate
little
bare
feet
came
pattering
behind
her
and
a
shrill
voice
called
wait
betty
wait
a
minute
it
was
davy
appleton
little
lamb
they
called
him
and
betty
shadow
and
because
everywhere
she
went
there
was
davy
just
at
her
heels
all
the
appleton
children
were
boys
three
younger
and
two
older
than
davy
whose
last
birthday
cake
should
have
had
eight
candles
if
there
had
been
any
celebration
of
the
event
but
there
never
had
been
a
birthday
cake
with
candles
on
it
on
the
appleton
table
it
would
have
been
considered
a
foolish
waste
of
time
and
money
and
birthdays
came
and
went
sometimes
without
the
children
knowing
that
they
had
passed
davy
was
a
queer
little
fellow
he
tagged
along
after
betty
switching
at
the
grass
with
a
whip
he
carried
never
saying
a
word
after
that
first
eager
call
for
her
to
wait
the
two
never
tired
of
each
other
he
was
content
to
follow
and
ask
no
questions
for
he
had
learned
long
ago
to
look
twice
before
he
spoke
once
as
he
caught
up
with
her
at
the
gate
he
did
not
even
ask
where
she
was
going
knowing
that
he
would
find
out
in
due
time
if
he
only
followed
far
enough
he
did
not
have
to
follow
far
betty
led
the
way
across
the
road
to
a
plain
little
wooden
church
set
back
in
a
grove
of
behind
the
church
was
a
graveyard
where
they
often
strolled
on
summer
afternoons
through
the
tangle
of
grass
and
weeds
and
myrtle
vines
to
read
the
names
on
the
tombstones
and
smell
the
pinks
and
lilies
that
struggled
up
year
after
year
above
the
neglected
mounds
but
that
was
not
their
errand
a
little
red
bookcase
inside
the
church
was
the
attraction
betty
had
only
lately
discovered
it
although
it
had
stood
for
years
on
a
back
bench
in
a
cobwebby
corner
it
held
all
that
was
left
of
a
scattered
library
that
had
been
in
use
two
generations
before
queer
little
books
they
were
and
musty
smelling
but
to
little
betty
hungry
for
something
new
they
seemed
a
veritable
she
had
found
that
no
key
barred
her
way
into
this
little
red
of
a
bookcase
and
a
board
propped
against
the
wall
under
the
window
outside
gave
her
an
easy
entrance
into
the
church
here
she
came
day
after
day
when
her
work
was
done
to
pore
over
the
musty
old
volumes
of
tales
forgotten
long
ago
in
betty
little
room
under
the
roof
at
home
was
a
pile
of
handsomely
bound
books
lying
on
a
chest
beside
her
mother
bible
they
were
twelve
in
all
and
had
come
in
several
different
christmas
boxes
and
each
one
had
betty
name
on
the
with
the
date
of
the
christmas
on
which
it
happened
to
be
sent
underneath
was
always
written
from
your
loving
godmother
elizabeth
lloyd
sherman
excepting
a
few
and
some
census
reports
they
were
the
only
books
in
the
appleton
house
betty
guarded
them
like
a
little
dragon
they
were
the
only
things
she
owned
that
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
touch
even
davy
when
he
was
permitted
to
look
at
the
wonderful
pictures
in
her
arabian
nights
or
pilgrim
progress
or
mother
goose
had
to
sit
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
while
she
carefully
turned
the
leaves
besides
these
three
there
was
alice
in
wonderland
and
æsop
fables
there
was
robinson
crusoe
and
little
women
and
two
volumes
of
fairy
tales
in
green
and
gold
with
a
gorgeous
peacock
on
the
cover
eugene
field
poems
had
come
in
the
last
box
with
riley
songs
of
childhood
and
kipling
jungle
tales
twelve
beautiful
books
all
of
sherman
giving
and
they
were
like
twelve
great
windows
to
betty
opening
into
a
new
strange
world
far
away
from
the
experiences
of
her
life
she
had
read
them
over
and
over
so
many
times
that
she
always
knew
what
was
coming
next
even
before
she
turned
the
page
and
she
had
read
them
to
the
other
children
so
many
times
that
they
too
knew
them
almost
by
heart
the
little
books
in
the
proved
poor
reading
sometimes
after
such
entertainment
so
many
of
them
were
about
unnaturally
good
children
who
never
did
wrong
and
unnaturally
bad
children
who
never
did
right
at
the
end
there
was
always
the
word
moral
in
big
capital
letters
as
if
the
readers
were
supposed
to
be
too
blind
to
find
it
for
themselves
and
it
had
to
be
put
directly
across
the
path
for
them
to
stumble
over
betty
laughed
at
them
sometimes
but
she
touched
the
little
books
with
reverent
fingers
when
she
remembered
how
old
they
were
and
how
long
ago
their
first
childish
readers
laid
them
aside
the
hands
that
had
held
them
first
had
years
before
grown
tired
and
wrinkled
and
old
and
had
been
lying
for
a
generation
under
the
myrtle
and
lilies
of
the
churchyard
outside
many
an
afternoon
she
had
spent
perched
in
the
high
window
with
her
feet
drawn
up
under
her
on
the
sill
reading
aloud
to
davy
who
lay
outside
on
the
grass
staring
up
at
the
sky
davy
short
fat
legs
could
not
climb
from
the
board
to
the
and
since
this
little
mahomet
could
not
come
to
the
mountain
betty
had
to
carry
the
mountain
to
him
the
reading
was
slow
work
sometimes
davy
mind
like
his
legs
could
not
climb
as
far
as
betty
and
she
usually
had
to
stop
at
the
bottom
of
every
page
to
explain
something
often
he
fell
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
most
interesting
part
and
then
betty
read
on
to
herself
with
nothing
to
break
the
stillness
around
her
but
the
buzzing
of
the
wasps
as
they
darted
angrily
in
and
out
of
the
open
window
above
her
head
betty
had
read
nearly
an
hour
and
davy
eyelids
were
beginning
to
flutter
drowsily
when
they
heard
the
slow
thud
of
a
horse
hoofs
in
the
thick
dust
of
the
road
betty
stopped
reading
to
listen
and
davy
sat
up
to
look
it
jake
he
announced
recognising
the
boy
who
had
helped
his
father
with
the
ploughing
hope
he
wo
see
us
said
betty
in
a
low
tone
drawing
in
her
head
we
are
not
hurting
anything
but
maybe
some
of
the
church
people
would
like
it
if
they
knew
i
climbed
in
at
the
window
they
might
think
it
was
respectful
he
looking
this
way
said
davy
who
had
stood
up
for
a
better
view
but
squatted
down
again
at
betty
command
illustration
oh
run
and
get
it
quick
davy
she
cried
it
was
too
late
jake
had
recognised
davy
shock
of
yellow
hair
and
called
out
hello
where
betty
somewhere
around
here
i
bet
anything
or
you
would
be
here
i
got
a
letter
for
her
at
that
betty
leaned
so
far
out
of
the
window
that
she
nearly
lost
her
balance
and
toppled
over
oh
run
and
get
it
quick
davy
she
cried
the
little
bare
feet
twinkled
through
the
grass
to
meet
the
old
sorrel
horse
and
two
brown
hands
were
held
up
to
receive
the
letter
but
jake
preferred
to
deliver
the
important
document
himself
here
you
are
he
said
riding
alongside
the
window
and
dropping
the
letter
into
her
eager
hands
oh
you
jake
she
cried
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
christmas
was
coming
i
never
got
a
letter
in
my
life
except
in
my
christmas
boxes
my
godmother
always
writes
to
me
then
and
this
must
be
from
her
too
yes
it
is
i
know
her
handwriting
if
jake
expected
her
to
tear
it
open
instantly
and
share
the
news
with
him
before
she
had
examined
every
inch
of
the
big
square
envelope
he
was
disappointed
the
old
sorrel
had
carried
him
out
of
sight
before
she
had
finished
cutting
it
open
with
a
pin
then
she
spread
the
letter
out
on
her
knees
drawing
a
long
breath
of
pleasure
as
the
faintest
odour
of
violets
floated
up
from
the
paper
with
its
dainty
monogram
at
the
top
davy
waited
in
silence
watching
a
flush
spread
over
betty
face
as
she
read
her
breath
came
short
and
her
heart
beat
fast
oh
davy
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
wondering
tone
what
do
you
think
it
is
an
invitation
to
a
house
party
at
locust
lloyd
sherman
house
party
oh
it
like
a
lovely
lovely
fairy
tale
with
me
for
the
princess
i
never
travelled
on
the
cars
since
i
was
old
enough
to
remember
it
and
they
sent
passes
for
me
to
go
i
never
had
any
girls
to
play
with
in
all
my
life
and
now
there
will
be
two
besides
lloyd
and
oh
davy
best
of
all
i
see
my
beautiful
beautiful
godmother
i
shall
be
there
a
whole
month
and
she
knew
my
mamma
and
was
her
dearest
friend
i
have
seen
her
since
i
was
a
baby
when
she
came
to
my
christening
and
of
course
i
ca
remember
anything
about
that
davy
listened
to
her
raptures
without
saying
anything
for
awhile
then
he
set
aside
his
usual
custom
and
asked
a
question
why
are
you
crying
he
demanded
there
a
tear
running
down
the
side
of
your
nose
is
there
asked
betty
brushing
it
away
with
the
back
of
her
hand
i
did
know
it
maybe
it
because
i
am
so
glad
it
seems
as
if
i
was
going
back
to
my
own
family
to
somebody
who
really
belongs
to
you
more
than
just
fourth
cousins
you
know
a
godmother
must
be
the
next
best
thing
to
a
real
mother
you
see
davy
because
it
a
mother
that
god
gives
you
to
take
the
place
of
your
own
when
she
is
gone
oh
hurry
home
and
tell
cousin
hetty
slipping
from
the
to
the
floor
she
carried
the
book
she
had
been
reading
back
to
its
corner
in
the
little
red
bookcase
and
shut
it
up
with
the
musty
volumes
inside
then
she
walked
slowly
down
the
narrow
aisle
of
the
little
between
its
double
rows
of
narrow
pews
as
she
reached
the
altar
extending
in
front
of
the
pulpit
she
slipped
to
her
knees
a
moment
her
sunbonnet
had
fallen
back
from
her
tousled
curls
and
the
late
afternoon
sun
streamed
across
her
shining
little
face
thank
you
god
came
in
a
happy
whisper
from
the
depths
of
a
glad
little
heart
it
the
nicest
surprise
you
ever
sent
me
and
i
much
obliged
then
betty
stood
up
and
put
on
her
sunbonnet
the
next
moment
she
had
scrambled
over
the
sill
pulled
the
window
down
after
her
and
walked
down
the
slanting
board
to
the
ground
catching
davy
by
the
hand
and
swinging
it
back
and
forth
as
they
ran
she
went
skipping
across
the
road
regardless
of
the
dust
down
the
lane
they
went
between
the
rows
of
across
the
orchard
and
up
the
path
somehow
the
world
had
never
before
seemed
half
so
beautiful
to
betty
as
it
did
now
the
may
skies
had
never
been
quite
so
blue
or
the
afternoon
sunshine
so
heavenly
golden
she
sang
as
she
went
swinging
davy
warm
little
hand
in
hers
it
was
only
one
of
mother
goose
old
melodies
but
she
sang
it
as
a
bird
sings
for
sheer
gladness
gay
go
up
and
gay
go
down
to
ring
the
bells
of
london
town
chapter
iii
one
flew
east
the
new
york
letter
reached
the
hotel
while
eugenia
was
out
in
the
park
with
her
maid
and
the
brought
it
to
her
on
a
salver
with
several
others
as
she
was
stepping
into
the
elevator
to
go
up
to
her
room
here
take
my
gloves
eliot
she
exclaimed
tossing
them
to
the
maid
and
beginning
to
tear
open
the
envelopes
as
soon
as
her
hands
were
free
eliot
a
plain
woman
with
a
patient
face
and
slow
gait
picked
up
the
gloves
and
followed
her
young
mistress
down
the
corridor
eugenia
dashed
into
her
throwing
herself
into
a
big
armchair
regardless
of
the
fact
that
she
was
crushing
the
roses
in
her
pretty
new
hat
as
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
high
back
three
of
the
letters
which
she
opened
so
eagerly
were
from
the
girls
who
had
been
her
best
friends
at
she
had
been
away
from
riverdale
seminary
only
a
week
but
already
she
was
homesick
to
go
back
the
school
was
a
very
select
one
and
the
rules
were
rigid
but
eugenia
had
known
no
other
home
for
three
years
in
the
great
hotel
where
she
was
now
she
saw
her
father
only
in
the
evenings
and
during
breakfast
and
she
always
rebelled
when
she
had
to
go
back
to
it
in
vacation
there
was
so
little
she
could
do
that
she
really
enjoyed
there
was
a
stupid
round
of
drives
and
walks
shopping
and
piano
practice
and
after
that
nothing
but
to
mope
and
fret
and
worry
poor
eliot
at
school
there
was
always
the
excitement
of
evading
some
rule
or
breaking
it
without
being
caught
and
if
there
was
no
joke
in
prospect
to
giggle
over
there
was
the
memory
of
one
just
passed
to
make
them
laugh
and
then
there
were
always
mollie
and
fay
and
kit
keller
dear
old
kell
ready
to
laugh
or
cry
or
lark
with
her
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
as
it
suited
her
mood
only
seven
days
of
vacation
had
passed
but
to
eugenia
it
seemed
an
age
since
the
four
had
walked
back
and
forth
across
the
school
campus
with
their
arms
around
each
other
waiting
for
the
that
was
to
drive
them
to
the
station
the
others
were
not
so
sorry
to
go
for
they
would
be
in
the
midst
of
their
families
mollie
was
to
go
to
the
mountains
with
all
the
members
of
her
household
fay
to
an
island
in
the
lawrence
where
her
family
had
their
summer
home
and
kell
was
going
on
a
long
yachting
trip
maybe
to
the
bermudas
it
would
be
september
before
they
all
met
again
for
eugenia
there
was
nothing
in
prospect
but
lonely
days
at
the
waldorf
until
her
father
could
find
time
to
take
her
down
to
the
seashore
for
a
few
weeks
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
when
she
laid
down
the
three
letters
after
twice
reading
the
one
signed
for
ever
your
devoted
old
chum
kell
it
had
been
full
of
the
good
times
she
was
having
at
home
eugenia
looked
around
the
elegantly
furnished
room
with
a
discontented
sigh
no
girl
in
the
school
had
as
much
spending
money
as
herself
or
as
wealthy
and
as
indulgent
a
father
and
yet
just
at
that
moment
she
felt
herself
the
poorest
child
in
new
york
there
was
one
thing
she
lacked
that
even
the
poorest
beggar
had
she
thought
bitterly
companionship
in
a
listless
sort
of
way
she
picked
up
the
remaining
letter
postmarked
lloydsboro
valley
and
began
to
read
it
eliot
who
was
busy
in
the
adjoining
room
heard
an
excited
exclamation
and
then
the
call
oh
eliot
eliot
come
here
quick
she
was
stooping
over
the
bed
inspecting
some
clean
clothes
that
had
been
sent
in
from
the
laundry
before
she
could
straighten
herself
up
to
answer
the
call
her
elbows
were
seized
from
behind
and
eugenia
began
waltzing
her
around
backwards
at
a
rate
that
made
her
head
spin
dance
you
giddy
old
thing
cried
eugenia
whoop
and
make
a
noise
and
act
as
if
you
are
glad
we
are
going
to
get
out
of
our
cage
next
week
i
invited
to
a
house
party
we
are
to
spend
a
whole
month
in
a
not
a
hotel
we
going
to
be
part
of
a
real
live
family
in
a
real
sure
enough
home
in
an
old
southern
mansion
goodness
gracious
miss
eugenia
panted
eliot
as
she
staggered
into
a
chair
and
settled
her
cap
on
her
head
you
scared
me
out
of
me
five
wits
you
were
that
sudden
in
your
movements
i
thought
for
a
bit
as
you
had
gone
stark
mad
you
gave
me
quite
a
turn
you
did
eugenia
laughed
i
had
to
let
off
steam
in
some
way
she
said
and
really
eliot
you
ca
imagine
how
glad
i
am
they
cousins
of
papa
you
know
the
shermans
are
i
used
to
know
lloyd
when
they
lived
in
new
york
we
played
together
every
day
and
fussed
my
eyes
how
we
fussed
but
that
was
before
she
could
talk
plain
and
she
must
be
eleven
now
for
she
about
two
years
younger
than
i
am
perching
herself
on
the
bed
among
piles
of
snowy
linen
eugenia
clasped
her
hands
around
her
knees
and
began
to
tell
all
she
could
remember
of
the
little
colonel
because
there
was
no
one
else
to
confide
in
she
confided
in
the
maid
patient
old
eliot
listened
to
much
family
history
that
did
not
interest
her
and
which
she
immediately
forgot
and
to
many
girlish
rhapsodies
over
cousin
elizabeth
whom
eugenia
declared
was
the
dearest
thing
that
ever
drew
the
breath
of
life
as
eugenia
talked
on
idly
rocking
herself
back
and
forth
on
the
bed
eliot
sorted
the
linen
with
deft
fingers
laying
some
of
it
away
in
drawers
sweet
with
dainty
sachets
and
putting
some
aside
that
needed
a
stitch
or
two
presently
as
she
listened
she
found
herself
taking
more
interest
in
the
country
place
that
eugenia
described
than
in
anything
she
had
heard
of
since
she
said
to
her
dear
little
cottage
home
in
england
she
began
to
hope
that
forbes
would
consent
to
accepting
the
invitation
and
expressed
that
wish
to
eugenia
why
of
course
i
am
going
exclaimed
eugenia
in
surprise
whether
papa
wants
me
to
or
not
i
shall
answer
cousin
elizabeth
letter
this
very
minute
and
accept
the
invitation
before
he
comes
home
then
if
he
makes
a
fuss
it
will
be
too
late
and
i
can
tease
him
into
a
good
humour
bouncing
off
the
bed
she
went
back
to
the
and
sat
down
at
her
desk
when
that
letter
was
written
carefully
and
in
her
best
style
she
dashed
off
three
notes
in
an
almost
unreadable
scrawl
to
mollie
and
fay
and
kell
telling
them
of
her
invitation
and
the
delight
it
gave
her
then
she
wandered
back
to
the
bedroom
where
eliot
sat
mending
and
wandered
restlessly
around
the
room
how
slow
the
time
goes
she
exclaimed
pausing
in
front
of
the
mantel
two
hours
until
papa
will
be
here
i
want
to
tell
him
about
it
and
ask
for
some
more
money
i
need
an
extra
allowance
for
this
visit
there
was
a
little
dresden
clock
on
the
mantel
two
cupids
holding
up
a
flower
basket
from
which
swung
a
spray
of
roses
that
formed
the
pendulum
two
long
hours
she
fumed
scowling
at
the
clock
hurry
up
you
old
she
cried
catching
up
the
fragile
little
timepiece
and
shaking
it
until
the
pendulum
rattled
against
the
cupids
plump
legs
i
ca
bear
to
wait
for
things
but
life
is
mostly
waiting
miss
said
eliot
with
a
solemn
shake
of
her
head
you
find
that
out
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
we
wait
for
this
and
we
wait
for
that
and
first
thing
we
know
the
years
are
gone
and
we
are
standing
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
waiting
for
death
to
lift
us
in
eugenia
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
with
a
little
scream
stop
talking
like
that
eliot
she
cried
i
wo
listen
and
i
wo
spend
my
life
waiting
in
that
way
you
may
if
you
want
to
running
back
to
her
she
banged
the
door
behind
her
to
shut
out
the
sound
of
eliot
voice
the
next
hour
she
spent
by
the
window
looking
down
on
the
shifting
scenes
of
the
streets
below
the
noisy
new
york
streets
spread
out
like
a
giant
before
her
then
it
began
to
grow
dark
and
lights
twinkled
here
and
there
and
great
letters
of
flame
appeared
as
by
magic
across
the
fronts
of
buildings
and
on
the
electric
arches
spanning
the
streets
eliot
came
and
drew
the
curtains
and
a
glance
at
the
little
cupids
told
her
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
i
wear
my
buttercup
dress
eliot
said
eugenia
when
her
black
hair
had
been
carefully
brushed
and
plaited
in
two
long
braids
it
always
makes
my
eyes
look
so
big
and
dark
somehow
and
brings
out
the
colour
in
my
lips
and
cheeks
you
are
a
young
one
to
be
noticing
such
things
as
that
said
eliot
under
her
breath
she
wanted
to
say
it
aloud
but
she
only
pursed
her
lips
together
as
she
got
out
the
dress
eugenia
had
asked
for
it
was
of
some
soft
clinging
material
of
the
same
sunny
yellow
that
buttercups
wear
and
eugenia
knew
very
well
how
becoming
it
was
to
her
brunette
style
of
beauty
after
she
was
dressed
she
spun
around
before
the
until
she
heard
her
father
step
in
the
hall
although
she
had
been
so
impatient
for
his
coming
she
said
nothing
about
the
invitation
from
locust
until
they
had
gone
down
to
dinner
and
were
seated
in
the
great
together
she
knew
that
that
was
not
the
way
mollie
or
fay
or
kell
would
have
done
any
one
of
them
would
have
rushed
at
her
father
the
moment
he
came
in
sight
and
would
have
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
poured
out
the
whole
story
but
eugenia
had
never
felt
on
such
intimate
terms
with
her
father
she
admired
him
extremely
and
thought
he
was
the
handsomest
man
she
had
ever
seen
but
her
love
for
him
was
of
a
selfish
kind
so
long
as
he
indulged
her
and
never
opposed
her
will
she
was
a
most
dutiful
little
daughter
but
as
soon
as
his
wishes
crossed
hers
she
pouted
and
sulked
to
her
surprise
he
made
no
objection
to
her
accepting
the
invitation
to
the
house
party
except
to
say
do
you
think
you
are
a
little
selfish
to
want
to
run
off
and
leave
me
alone
when
scarcely
seen
you
all
winter
then
he
laughed
outright
as
she
made
a
saucy
little
grimace
in
answer
he
would
miss
her
very
much
when
she
was
gone
for
she
was
a
bright
little
thing
and
amused
him
but
he
had
a
feeling
of
relief
as
well
to
think
that
a
month
of
her
vacation
would
be
pleasantly
occupied
she
had
been
so
discontented
away
from
her
little
friends
after
dinner
they
strolled
into
an
alcove
screened
from
the
hall
by
great
pots
of
palms
and
sat
down
to
listen
to
the
music
and
watch
the
people
passing
back
and
forth
it
was
a
gay
scene
ladies
in
elaborate
evening
gowns
passed
out
with
their
escorts
to
the
opera
or
waited
for
the
carriages
that
were
to
take
them
later
to
balls
or
receptions
everywhere
there
was
the
gleam
of
white
shoulders
the
nodding
of
jewelled
aigrettes
the
flashing
of
diamond
tiaras
above
it
all
rose
the
odour
of
flowers
the
hum
of
voices
and
the
music
of
violins
forbes
smiling
through
eyelids
at
this
passing
of
vanity
fair
looked
down
at
eugenia
she
was
leaning
forward
in
a
picturesque
pose
against
the
arm
of
her
chair
the
light
fell
softly
on
her
pale
yellow
gown
and
her
dusky
hair
the
red
lips
were
parted
in
a
smile
as
she
watched
the
pretty
pageant
and
there
was
a
bright
colour
in
her
cheeks
forbes
was
proud
of
his
handsome
little
daughter
he
admired
her
ease
of
manner
and
boasted
that
she
was
as
under
all
circumstances
as
any
grown
woman
he
knew
it
pleased
him
to
have
his
friends
predict
that
she
would
be
a
brilliant
social
success
he
was
doing
everything
in
his
power
to
make
her
that
and
yet
sometimes
a
vague
fear
crossed
his
mind
that
she
was
growing
cold
and
selfish
sometimes
she
seemed
far
too
old
and
for
a
child
of
her
age
he
sighed
as
he
looked
at
her
they
were
sitting
so
near
each
other
that
his
hand
rested
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
yet
he
felt
that
they
had
grown
widely
apart
in
their
long
absences
what
are
you
thinking
about
eugenia
he
asked
suddenly
she
turned
with
a
little
start
oh
i
had
forgotten
that
you
were
there
she
exclaimed
i
was
thinking
of
locust
and
how
glad
i
would
be
to
get
away
from
this
tiresome
place
it
such
a
bore
to
do
the
same
thing
night
after
night
and
always
watch
the
same
kind
of
people
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
but
she
did
not
see
it
she
had
turned
back
to
her
in
which
he
had
no
part
happy
little
of
what
was
to
come
with
the
coming
june
chapter
iv
one
flew
west
out
in
the
village
of
plainsville
kansas
the
rain
was
running
in
torrents
down
the
gables
of
the
little
brown
house
where
the
ware
family
lived
it
had
rained
all
day
a
cold
steady
pour
until
the
world
outside
had
taken
on
the
appearance
of
early
march
instead
of
late
may
holland
and
mary
and
the
baby
they
called
him
baby
still
although
he
was
nearly
four
were
playing
menagerie
in
the
corners
of
the
they
had
a
tent
made
of
the
and
some
sheets
and
the
growling
and
roaring
that
went
on
inside
was
something
terrific
it
made
no
difference
to
the
little
mother
placidly
sewing
by
the
last
rays
of
daylight
at
one
of
the
western
windows
but
the
noise
grated
on
joyce
mood
joyce
had
finished
setting
the
and
while
she
waited
for
the
potatoes
to
boil
she
stood
with
her
face
pressed
against
the
kitchen
window
looking
gloomily
out
into
the
back
yard
it
was
not
a
cheerful
outlook
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
high
board
alley
fence
with
a
broken
leaning
against
it
the
old
stable
and
a
scraggy
dripping
the
yard
was
full
of
puddles
and
still
the
rain
splashed
on
the
sight
made
joyce
want
to
cry
if
i
was
at
home
she
said
to
herself
i
should
think
that
i
am
homesick
for
i
feel
the
way
i
did
that
day
up
in
monsieur
in
the
old
french
garden
then
i
was
tired
of
france
and
everything
foreign
and
would
have
given
all
i
owned
to
be
back
in
america
now
i
am
here
with
mother
and
the
children
but
still
i
am
as
unhappy
and
dissatisfied
as
i
was
then
i
wonder
why
it
had
been
less
than
a
year
since
joyce
had
had
that
wonderful
winter
in
touraine
with
her
cousin
kate
but
it
seemed
such
a
long
long
time
ago
in
looking
back
upon
it
she
had
settled
down
into
the
common
humdrum
round
of
duties
so
completely
that
sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
been
away
at
all
that
she
must
have
dreamed
that
year
into
her
life
or
read
about
it
as
happening
to
some
other
girl
as
she
stood
with
her
face
pressed
against
the
the
noise
in
the
suddenly
ceased
and
mary
came
into
the
kitchen
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
menagerie
i
tired
of
being
a
lion
she
said
wiping
her
flushed
little
face
with
the
sleeve
of
her
apron
and
shaking
back
her
funny
little
tails
of
hair
tied
with
red
ribbon
that
were
always
bobbing
forward
over
her
shoulders
i
roared
till
my
throat
is
sore
and
i
hungry
is
supper
most
ready
sister
joyce
glanced
at
the
clock
it
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
she
answered
and
returned
to
her
survey
of
the
back
yard
i
wish
that
we
were
going
to
have
dumplings
for
supper
said
holland
and
turkey
and
sausages
do
you
mary
he
snuffed
hungrily
at
the
saucepan
on
the
stove
no
said
mary
pausing
thoughtfully
as
if
considering
a
weighty
matter
i
rather
have
ice
cream
and
chocolate
cake
if
i
had
a
witch
with
a
wand
that
what
i
wish
for
supper
would
you
sister
joyce
turned
away
from
the
window
and
lifted
the
lid
from
the
kettle
in
which
the
stew
was
bubbling
i
do
know
she
said
gazing
dreamily
into
the
depths
of
the
savoury
stew
if
i
had
that
old
witch
with
a
wand
that
you
are
always
talking
about
i
not
stop
simply
with
something
to
eat
i
would
wish
myself
back
in
tours
with
madame
sweeping
down
to
dinner
in
her
red
velvet
gown
and
the
shining
on
the
cut
glass
and
silver
i
wish
for
dinner
to
be
served
elegantly
in
courses
as
henri
did
it
there
every
night
and
i
hear
old
monsieur
making
his
little
jokes
over
the
walnuts
and
wine
and
afterward
there
would
be
any
dishes
for
me
to
wash
as
there
are
here
and
at
bedtime
marie
would
come
with
my
candle
and
untie
my
slippers
and
brush
my
hair
oh
it
so
nice
to
be
waited
on
you
know
how
i
miss
it
sometimes
it
is
horrid
to
be
poor
mary
and
holland
listened
in
flattering
silence
they
had
great
respect
for
their
old
sister
who
had
been
across
seas
and
visited
old
chateaux
where
kings
and
queens
once
lived
she
was
the
only
child
in
plainsville
who
could
boast
the
distinction
of
having
been
abroad
and
there
was
a
glamour
about
it
that
enchanted
them
they
were
never
tired
of
hearing
of
her
adventures
it
horrid
to
be
poor
she
said
again
clapping
the
lid
on
the
kettle
i
hate
to
live
in
a
little
house
and
spoil
my
hands
with
dust
and
and
do
the
same
things
year
in
and
year
out
joyce
stopped
suddenly
wishing
that
she
could
unsay
that
last
speech
for
the
little
mother
had
come
into
the
kitchen
in
time
to
hear
it
there
was
a
pained
expression
on
her
face
i
am
afraid
my
bird
of
passage
will
never
be
satisfied
with
the
little
home
nest
again
she
said
sadly
oh
mother
i
did
mean
it
as
bad
as
it
sounds
truly
i
did
cried
joyce
you
know
that
usually
i
am
as
contented
as
a
cricket
but
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
it
must
be
the
weather
just
then
there
was
a
stamping
on
the
porch
outside
and
the
violent
flapping
of
an
umbrella
to
rid
it
of
the
raindrops
clinging
to
it
jack
shouted
mary
rushing
to
the
door
with
holland
and
the
baby
tagging
at
her
heels
a
letter
for
joyce
they
called
in
chorus
the
next
instant
all
straggling
back
after
the
oldest
brother
as
he
bore
it
triumphantly
into
the
kitchen
from
lloydsboro
valley
announced
joyce
and
ware
face
lighted
up
with
one
of
her
rare
smiles
ah
i
knew
it
was
coming
she
said
and
i
am
sure
it
will
prove
an
antidote
for
your
blues
i
had
a
letter
from
the
same
place
last
week
and
i
been
in
the
secret
ever
since
what
secret
demanded
mary
her
eyes
round
with
curiosity
and
jack
echoed
the
question
that
joyce
was
to
be
invited
to
a
house
party
in
june
back
in
old
kentucky
home
the
invitation
is
from
one
of
my
old
school
friends
there
were
three
of
us
she
went
on
in
answer
to
the
look
of
eager
interest
in
mary
eyes
three
girls
who
grew
up
together
joyce
allen
your
sister
is
named
for
her
elizabeth
lloyd
and

little
daughters

the
same
dear
old
valley
where
we
played
together
and
grew
up
together
and
learned
to
love
each
other
like
sisters
i
hope
they
will
become
as
dear
friends
as
we
were
joyce
looked
up
from
her
letter
her
face
aglow
with
joyful
surprise
oh
mother
she
cried
do
you
really
mean
it
is
it
possible
that
i
am
to
go
how
can
you
afford
it
ware
motioned
toward
the
envelope
lying
at
joyce
feet
look
again
she
said
and
you
will
find
that
sherman
has
sent
a
pass
as
for
the
clothes
well
your
with
a
wand
has
come
to
the
rescue
again
cousin
kate
gasped
joyce
ware
nodded
what
would
you
think
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
there
has
been
a
box
hidden
away
in
my
closet
for
nearly
a
week
waiting
for
this
letter
which
i
knew
was
on
its
way
and
inside
are
the
very
things
you
need
to
complete
your
summer
outfit
there
is
a
new
hat
for
one
thing
and
material
for
several
very
pretty
dresses
mary
danced
up
and
down
her
hair
ribbons
bobbing
over
her
shoulders
and
her
face
ashine
as
she
cried
oh
sister
is
it
lovely
i
so
glad
i
so
glad
i
so
glad
but
joyce
stood
with
her
face
suddenly
grown
serious
and
her
lips
trembling
her
little
sister
unselfish
delight
made
her
conscience
hurt
putting
her
arms
around
her
mother
neck
she
hid
her
face
against
her
shoulder
oh
mother
she
sobbed
i
do
deserve
it
all
here
i
been
so
fretful
and
discontented
all
day
thinking
never
be
any
good
times
any
more
and
that
there
was
nothing
but
work
ahead
of
me
and
all
the
time
this
beautiful
surprise
was
on
its
way
i
do
deserve
for
it
to
be
mine
it
ought
to
be
mary
she
never
frets
over
things
ware
looked
down
into
mary
face
still
with
the
thought
of
her
sister
pleasure
and
said
mary
is
to
have
a
little
slice
of
this
too
i
wonder
what
she
will
say
when
she
sees
a
certain
pink
parasol
that
i
saw
in
that
box
and
a
white
sash
with
pink
rosebuds
on
it
and
slippers
that
i
sure
would
fit
anything
else
in
the
house
but
her
own
wigglesome
little
feet
mary
hands
came
together
ecstatically
with
a
oh
then
she
clasped
her
mother
around
the
knees
demanding
breathlessly
anything
for
holland
in
that
box
yes
anything
for
jack
yes
anything
for
the
baby
ware
nodded
and
you
another
nod
then
there
is
a
single
word
in
the
dictionary
good
enough
to
fit
screamed
mary
excitedly
spinning
around
and
around
in
the
kitchen
floor
until
the
red
ribbons
stood
out
at
right
angles
from
her
head
there
is
a
single
word
holland
we
just
have
to
at
that
she
gave
a
long
shriek
that
seemed
to
go
through
the
roof
like
a
needle
holland
and
the
baby
joined
in
each
trying
to
make
a
louder
noise
than
the
other
their
eyes
were
tightly
shut
their
mouths
wide
open
and
their
faces
red
to
bursting
there
there
children
exclaimed
ware
laughingly
as
they
stopped
to
take
breath
the
neighbours
will
think
that
the
house
is
on
fire
we
have
a
policeman
after
us
if
you
make
such
a
noise
the
kettle
is
boiling
over
cried
holland
and
joyce
flew
to
the
rescue
jack
went
to
change
his
wet
clothes
and
the
three
smaller
children
trotted
back
and
forth
pushing
chairs
to
the
table
and
helping
to
carry
in
the
supper
many
a
bedraggled
that
evening
looked
out
from
under
his
dripping
umbrella
as
he
neared
the
little
brown
house
cheered
by
a
babel
of
happy
voices
the
lamplight
streaming
across
the
wet
pavement
drew
his
gaze
to
a
window
whose
blinds
had
not
been
closed
and
the
picture
lingered
pleasantly
in
his
memory
for
many
a
day
it
was
the
ware
family
at
supper
and
afterward
when
the
dishes
had
been
cleared
away
there
was
another
picture
to
shine
out
into
the
wet
night
the
children
unpacking
the
box
that
jack
had
dragged
out
of
its
mary
paraded
jubilantly
around
the
room
in
her
new
slippers
the
rosebud
sash
tied
around
her
gingham
apron
the
pink
parasol
held
high
above
her
head
and
her
face
such
a
picture
of
delight
that
one
could
not
look
at
her
without
smiling
too
illustration
she
sorted
the
ribbons
and
examined
the
gloves
even
the
baby
sat
up
an
hour
after
his
bedtime
to
take
part
in
the
unusual
excitement
the
prospect
of
joyce
seeing
the
old
valley
seemed
to
have
unlocked
a
door
into
the
little
mother
memory
story
after
story
she
brought
out
to
entertain
them
of
the
things
that
had
happened
when
she
was
a
little
schoolgirl
before
sorrow
and
worry
and
work
had
come
to
make
her
tired
and
sad
while
she
entertained
them
joyce
brought
a
bureau
drawer
from
her
bedroom
and
propping
it
on
two
chairs
began
looking
over
its
contents
she
sorted
the
ribbons
and
examined
the
gloves
counted
the
handkerchiefs
and
inspected
the
stockings
dividing
everything
into
three
piles
one
pile
was
pronounced
suitable
to
take
on
the
visit
one
good
enough
to
wear
at
home
after
another
renovating
and
one
altogether
past
wearing
it
a
sort
of
day
of
judgment
said
jack
who
was
watching
the
performance
with
interest
you
separating
the
sheep
from
the
goats
only
there
three
divisions
here
white
sheep
black
sheep
and
goats
i
love
for
such
days
to
come
said
mary
falling
upon
the
third
pile
and
bearing
it
away
as
her
lawful
spoils
for
i
always
get
all
the
goats
now
my
dolls
can
set
up
a
milliner
shop
and
store
with
all
this
stuff
that
joyce
has
thrown
away
you
may
take
my
new
umbrella
with
you
if
you
want
it
joyce
said
jack
i
have
used
it
half
a
dozen
times
since
i
got
it
christmas
and
you
will
want
to
put
on
style
in
kentucky
your
old
one
is
good
enough
for
me
to
use
out
here
in
plainsville
do
you
want
my
blue
spotted
necktie
sister
asked
holland
leaning
against
her
and
looking
up
into
her
face
with
an
anxious
little
pucker
on
his
forehead
it
the
best
one
i
got
but
you
may
take
it
if
you
want
to
and
maybe
began
mary
hesitatingly
she
stopped
an
instant
a
little
struggle
evidently
going
on
in
her
mind
then
she
began
again
bravely
yes
i
lend
it
to
you
if
you
want
it
you
may
take
my
new
rosebud
sash
there
a
queer
little
lump
came
into
joyce
throat
as
she
thanked
the
children
for
their
generous
offers
she
accepted
the
umbrella
but
refused
the
spotted
tie
and
rosebud
sash
to
the
evident
relief
of
their
owners
who
wanted
to
be
generous
but
were
glad
to
be
able
to
keep
the
part
of
their
wardrobes
they
most
admired
it
more
than
doubles
the
pleasure
does
it
mamma
said
joyce
to
have
everybody
take
so
much
interest
in
your
having
a
good
time
i
wonder
if
the
other
girls
are
having
as
much
fun
out
of
planning
for
their
visit
as
i
am
i
doubt
it
answered
ware
elizabeth
is
an
orphan
you
know
and
eugenia
forbes
with
all
her
wealth
is
practically
homeless
for
there
is
little
in
either
a
or
a
big
hotel
joyce
looked
around
on
the
cheerful
little
group
gathered
near
the
lamp
and
a
sudden
mist
blurred
her
sight
at
thought
of
leaving
them
she
would
not
have
exchanged
the
little
brown
house
and
what
it
held
just
then
for
a
king
palace
outside
in
the
of
the
night
the
rain
beat
against
the
like
some
poor
beggar
imploring
to
come
in
and
inside
it
was
so
cosy
and
bright
with
the
warmth
and
cheer
of
and
that
joyce
was
not
sure
after
all
that
she
could
leave
such
a
shelter
even
to
be
a
guest
at
the
little
colonel
house
party
chapter
betty
reaches
the
house
beautiful
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
while
the
dew
was
still
on
the
meadows
that
betty
fared
forth
on
her
pilgrimage
the
old
farm
wagon
that
was
to
take
her
to
the
railroad
station
two
miles
away
was
drawn
up
to
the
door
before
five
davy
proudly
held
the
reins
while
his
father
carried
betty
trunk
poor
shabby
little
old
leather
trunk
it
was
not
half
full
for
there
had
been
small
preparation
for
this
visit
betty
had
carefully
folded
the
few
gingham
dresses
she
possessed
and
the
new
blue
and
white
lawn
bought
for
her
to
wear
to
church
there
were
several
stitches
to
be
taken
in
her
plain
cotton
and
a
button
to
be
sewed
on
her
only
white
ruffled
apron
that
was
all
that
she
could
do
to
make
herself
ready
except
to
put
her
and
handkerchiefs
smoothly
into
a
little
box
that
had
once
held
toilet
soap
betty
felt
rich
in
ribbons
to
tie
up
her
bonnie
brown
hair
for
there
were
three
bows
the
colour
of
her
curls
and
two
of
red
and
one
of
delicate
blue
the
last
was
to
wear
with
the
new
lawn
and
in
order
to
keep
it
fresh
and
fine
it
lay
wrapped
in
all
week
between
the
times
of
its
sunday
wearings
and
the
handkerchiefs
well
six
of
them
were
plain
and
white
and
two
had
pictures
stamped
in
the
corners
one
told
the
story
of
red
ridinghood
and
the
other
had
scenes
from
cinderella
outlined
in
blue
they
had
been
davy
present
to
her
the
christmas
before
and
he
had
bought
them
at
squire
jaynes
store
with
his
own
precious
pennies
that
was
all
that
betty
had
intended
to
put
into
her
trunk
but
when
they
were
in
there
was
still
so
much
room
that
she
decided
to
take
her
books
and
several
of
her
chief
treasures
they
will
be
safer
she
said
to
herself
and
she
filled
a
box
with
cotton
in
which
to
pack
some
of
her
breakable
keepsakes
she
had
hesitated
some
time
about
taking
her
an
old
ledger
on
whose
blank
pages
she
had
written
many
verses
she
hardly
dared
call
them
poetry
and
yet
they
were
dear
to
her
because
they
were
the
outpourings
of
her
lonely
little
heart
all
the
children
knew
that
she
made
up
rhymes
but
only
davy
had
any
knowledge
of
the
old
ledger
he
could
not
understand
all
the
verses
she
read
to
him
about
the
wild
flowers
and
life
and
death
and
time
but
they
jingled
pleasantly
in
his
ears
and
he
made
an
attentive
listener
i
take
it
she
decided
at
last
slipping
some
loose
pages
in
between
the
covers
i
may
want
to
write
something
at
locust
she
paused
long
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
about
her
godmother
picture
that
hung
there
in
a
little
frame
of
pine
cones
i
do
know
whether
to
take
it
or
not
she
said
to
davy
looking
up
lovingly
at
the
madonna
of
her
dreams
whose
sweet
face
had
been
her
last
greeting
at
night
and
first
welcome
on
waking
for
several
years
i
hate
to
leave
it
behind
but
i
have
my
real
godmother
to
look
at
while
i
gone
and
it
seem
so
nice
to
have
this
picture
here
to
smile
at
me
when
i
get
back
as
if
she
was
glad
i
come
home
i
believe
i
leave
it
it
was
a
solemn
moment
when
betty
climbed
into
the
wagon
after
her
trunk
had
been
lifted
in
at
the
back
and
perched
herself
on
the
high
spring
seat
beside
davy
and
his
father
the
other
children
were
drawn
up
in
a
line
along
the
porch
to
watch
her
go
she
wore
one
of
her
dresses
of
dark
blue
gingham
and
her
white
sunbonnet
but
the
familiar
little
figure
had
taken
on
a
new
interest
to
them
they
regarded
her
as
some
sort
of
a
venturesome
columbus
about
to
launch
on
a
wild
voyage
of
discovery
none
of
them
had
ever
been
beyond
jaynes
in
their
journeyings
and
the
youngest
had
not
seen
even
that
much
of
the
outside
world
betty
herself
could
not
remember
having
been
on
a
longer
trip
than
to
livermore
a
village
ten
miles
away
there
was
an
excited
flutter
in
her
throat
as
the
wagon
started
forward
with
a
jolt
and
she
realised
that
now
she
was
looking
her
last
on
safe
familiar
scenes
and
breaking
loose
from
all
safe
familiar
landmarks
she
cried
again
looking
back
at
the
little
group
on
the
porch
with
tears
in
her
eyes
they
called
in
a
noisy
chorus
repeating
the
call
like
a
brood
of
clacking
guineas
until
the
wagon
passed
out
of
sight
down
the
lane
the
road
turned
at
the
church
betty
leaned
forward
for
one
more
look
at
the
window
on
whose
sill
she
had
passed
so
many
happy
afternoons
reading
to
davy
the
board
was
still
leaning
against
the
house
where
she
had
propped
it
dear
old
church
she
said
softly
to
herself
they
drove
around
the
corner
of
the
little
neglected
graveyard
where
the
headstones
gleamed
white
in
the
morning
sunshine
above
the
dark
glossy
green
of
the
myrtle
vines
how
peaceful
and
quiet
it
seemed
the
dew
still
shone
in
tiny
beads
on
the
cobwebs
spun
across
the
grass
a
spicy
smell
of
cedar
boughs
floated
across
the
road
to
them
and
a
dove
called
somewhere
in
the
distant
woodlands
as
they
passed
a
wild
rose
hung
over
the
gray
pickets
of
the
straggling
old
fence
and
waved
a
spray
of
pale
pink
blossoms
to
them
she
whispered
turning
for
one
more
look
at
the
familiar
headstones
they
were
like
old
friends
she
had
wandered
among
them
so
often
one
held
her
gaze
an
instant
with
its
marble
hand
pointing
the
place
in
a
marble
book
in
which
was
carved
one
text
how
often
she
had
spelled
the
words
pointing
out
the
deeply
carven
letters
to
davy
ye
also
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
the
headstones
knew
she
was
going
away
and
would
miss
her
she
said
to
them
too
nodding
the
white
sunbonnet
gravely
it
seemed
a
solemn
thing
to
start
on
such
a
journey
after
leaving
the
church
there
was
only
one
more
place
to
bid
and
that
was
the
schoolhouse
sitting
through
its
lonely
vacation
time
in
a
deserted
playground
gone
to
weeds
there
was
no
time
to
spare
at
the
station
appleton
tied
the
horses
and
hurried
to
have
betty
trunk
checked
the
shriek
of
the
locomotive
coming
down
the
track
made
betty
turn
cold
it
was
like
a
great
demon
thundering
toward
her
davy
edged
closer
to
her
moved
by
the
strange
surroundings
to
ask
a
question
say
betty
ai
you
afraid
yes
she
confessed
squeezing
the
warm
little
hand
in
her
own
which
had
suddenly
seemed
to
turn
to
ice
my
heart
is
going
like
a
scared
wild
rabbit
but
i
keep
saying
over
and
over
to
myself
what
the
python
said
do
you
remember
in
kaa
hunting
brave
heart
and
a
courteous
tongue
said
he
they
shall
carry
thee
far
through
the
jungle
manling
it
ca
be
such
a
very
big
jungle
that
i
going
into
and
godmother
will
meet
me
in
a
few
hours
do
forget
me
davy
while
i
gone
she
stooped
to
give
the
little
fellow
a
hug
and
a
kiss
on
each
dimpled
cheek
for
the
train
had
stopped
and
appleton
was
waiting
to
shake
hands
and
lift
her
up
the
steps
betty
stumbled
into
the
first
vacant
seat
she
saw
and
sat
up
primly
afraid
to
glance
behind
her
in
her
lap
tightly
clasped
by
both
hands
she
held
a
little
basket
of
brown
willow
it
had
two
handles
and
a
lid
with
double
flaps
she
carried
it
because
she
had
no
her
lunch
was
in
that
her
pass
five
nickels
and
the
red
ridinghood
handkerchief
you
can
let
that
be
a
sort
of
warning
to
you
said
appleton
at
parting
not
to
get
into
conversation
with
strangers
red
ridinghood
never
would
have
got
into
trouble
if
she
had
stopped
to
tell
the
wolf
all
she
knew
remembering
this
warning
betty
sat
up
very
straight
at
first
and
held
the
basket
handles
in
such
a
tight
grasp
that
her
fingers
ached
but
after
the
conductor
had
looked
at
her
pass
and
smiled
kindly
into
the
appealing
little
face
under
the
white
sunbonnet
she
felt
more
at
ease
and
began
to
look
shyly
about
her
somebody
grandmother
was
in
the
seat
in
front
of
her
such
a
fat
old
lady
that
betty
felt
sure
she
could
not
be
a
wolf
in
disguise
and
watched
her
with
neighbourly
interest
she
fell
to
wondering
about
her
where
she
lived
and
where
she
was
going
and
what
she
had
in
her
many
bags
boxes
and
satchels
things
were
not
half
so
strange
as
she
had
expected
them
to
be
the
and
and
whizzing
past
the
windows
were
exactly
like
the
ones
she
had
left
at
home
more
than
once
a
meadow
full
of
daisies
gleaming
on
her
sight
like
drifts
of
summer
snow
made
her
think
of
the
lower
pasture
at
home
where
she
had
waded
through
them
the
day
before
even
the
people
who
came
on
the
cars
at
the
stations
along
the
way
looked
like
the
people
she
saw
at
church
every
week
and
betty
soon
began
to
feel
very
much
at
home
after
awhile
the
train
stopped
at
a
junction
where
she
had
to
wait
several
hours
to
make
connection
with
the
louisville
train
but
even
that
did
not
turn
out
to
be
a
bad
experience
as
she
had
feared
for
the
old
lady
waited
too
and
she
was
as
anxious
to
find
a
friend
as
betty
was
so
it
was
not
long
until
the
two
were
talking
together
as
sociably
as
two
old
neighbours
and
they
ate
their
lunch
together
with
so
many
exchanges
of
confidences
that
they
were
both
surprised
when
betty
train
came
puffing
along
they
had
not
imagined
the
time
could
fly
so
fast
at
parting
they
kissed
each
other
as
if
they
had
always
been
friends
and
betty
climbed
into
the
car
with
a
warm
glow
in
her
heart
at
having
found
such
unexpected
pleasantness
along
the
way
it
was
silly
of
me
to
have
been
so
frightened
she
thought
the
world
is
a
jungle
after
all
and
we
are
just
as
apt
to
meet
the
grandmothers
as
the
wolves
when
we
go
travelling
she
was
mixing
kaa
experience
with
red
in
her
thought
but
it
made
no
difference
the
conclusion
she
reached
was
a
comfortable
one
so
she
leaned
back
in
her
seat
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
journey
without
any
foolish
fears
little
by
little
the
motion
of
the
train
had
its
effect
the
white
sunbonnet
nodded
nearer
and
nearer
toward
the
cushioned
back
of
the
seat
the
brown
eyes
drooped
drowsily
and
in
a
few
minutes
betty
was
sound
asleep
that
was
the
last
she
knew
of
the
trip
that
she
had
settled
herself
to
enjoy
for
when
she
awoke
the
brakeman
was
calling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
people
were
beginning
to
reach
up
to
the
racks
overhead
for
their
bundles
there
was
a
general
uprising
of
the
passengers
the
crowd
pushed
toward
the
door
carrying
the
startled
child
with
them
as
they
surged
down
the
aisle
and
all
at
once
as
she
stepped
off
the
train
she
found
herself
in
the
depths
of
her
dreaded
jungle
it
was
so
confusing
she
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
the
roar
and
clang
of
a
great
city
smote
on
her
ears
as
she
stood
in
the
big
union
depot
helpless
bewildered
and
as
lost
as
a
stray
kitten
in
the
midst
of
that
noisy
pushing
crowd
sharp
elbows
jostled
her
this
way
and
that
strange
faces
streamed
past
her
by
thousands
it
seemed
how
could
anybody
find
anybody
else
in
such
a
whirlpool
of
people
hunting
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
seemed
nothing
in
comparison
to
finding
her
godmother
in
such
a
crowd
betty
stood
looking
around
her
helplessly
in
the
middle
of
the
overpowering
din
of
whistles
and
bells
and
the
thunder
of
wheels
on
the
cobblestones
outside
that
moment
she
would
have
given
anything
she
owned
to
be
safely
back
on
the
quiet
farm
the
big
brown
eyes
in
the
depths
of
the
sunbonnet
filled
with
tears
but
she
resolutely
winked
them
back
whispering
the
python
words
a
brave
heart
and
a
courteous
tongue
manling
but
she
could
not
stop
the
frightened
thumping
in
her
breast
and
of
what
use
was
a
courteous
tongue
when
nobody
would
stop
to
listen
she
wondered
what
had
happened
to
make
a
whole
city
full
of
people
in
such
a
desperate
hurry
two
tears
splashed
down
on
the
brown
willow
and
then
no
telling
what
would
have
happened
next
had
not
the
jungle
opened
without
waiting
for
a
brave
heart
and
a
courteous
tongue
on
part
coming
toward
her
all
in
dainty
gray
and
white
was
a
lady
she
would
have
recognised
anywhere
that
face
that
had
been
the
madonna
of
her
dreams
both
waking
and
sleeping
since
the
first
night
it
had
kept
its
smiling
vigil
above
her
little
bed
could
belong
to
no
one
but
her
beautiful
godmother
with
a
glad
little
cry
of
recognition
she
sprang
forward
catching
one
slim
hand
in
hers
the
white
sunbonnet
fell
back
the
brown
eyes
looked
out
from
a
tangle
of
dusky
curls
with
a
world
of
loving
admiration
in
their
depths
and
the
next
instant
betty
was
folded
in
sherman
arms
joyce
allen
she
exclaimed
all
over
again
joyce
own
little
daughter
i
would
have
known
you
anywhere
dear
i
think
even
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
even
in
such
an
outlandish
costume
was
what
she
had
started
to
say
she
had
seen
betty
as
the
child
stepped
off
the
train
but
had
not
given
her
a
second
glance
as
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
little
guest
she
had
come
to
meet
would
travel
in
a
sunbonnet
but
betty
was
blissfully
unconscious
of
her
appearance
as
they
crossed
the
city
to
a
suburban
depot
she
was
so
interested
in
the
mysteries
of
the
on
which
they
rode
so
absorbed
by
the
great
they
passed
and
so
amazed
by
the
city
sights
and
sounds
on
every
hand
that
she
was
not
conscious
of
the
fact
that
she
even
had
a
head
it
might
have
been
bald
for
all
she
was
concerned
about
the
covering
of
it
the
little
colonel
was
waiting
in
the
carriage
at
the
depot
when
sherman
and
betty
stepped
off
the
train
at
lloydsboro
valley
rob
moore
had
come
down
too
curious
for
a
glimpse
at
the
first
arrival
he
grinned
at
the
expression
of
surprise
and
dismay
on
the
little
face
as
her
glance
fell
on
betty
was
it
that
her
little
guest
had
no
hat
she
wondered
or
was
it
because
no
one
in
the
cuckoo
nest
had
ever
taught
her
any
better
than
to
go
travelling
in
such
style
and
carrying
a
little
willow
basket
too
how
odd
and
countrified
she
looked
but
lloyd
was
too
ladylike
to
show
her
disappointment
she
climbed
out
of
the
carriage
and
greeted
betty
as
graciously
as
her
mother
had
done
then
straightway
she
forgot
her
annoyance
for
the
sweet
friendliness
of
the
little
face
smiling
up
into
hers
was
irresistible
does
the
valley
look
as
you
thought
it
would
elizabeth
asked
sherman
as
the
carriage
rolled
homeward
past
handsome
suburban
homes
with
closely
cut
lawns
and
trimly
kept
paths
no
said
betty
hesitatingly
you
see
i
thought
you
lived
in
the
country
and
i
suppose
it
is
a
sort
of
country
but
not
the
kind
that
i
live
in
here
everything
is
pruned
and
raked
until
it
looks
as
if
it
had
just
had
its
hair
parted
smoothly
in
the
middle
and
its
tied
at
home
there
is
so
much
underbrush
and
such
a
tangle
of
weeds
and
high
grass
and
briers
that
the
yards
look
as
if
they
forgotten
to
comb
their
hair
when
they
got
up
and
had
gone
around
all
day
with
it
hanging
down
their
backs
in
snarls
the
little
colonel
laughed
the
newcomer
had
amusing
fancies
at
any
rate
and
there
the
same
difference
in
everything
else
continued
betty
the
same
difference
that
there
was
between
cinderella
pumpkin
and
her
gilded
coach
it
was
a
pumpkin
all
the
time
only
it
looked
different
after
it
was
bewitched
and
do
you
know
she
said
with
a
charming
little
burst
of
confidence
that
made
lloyd
heart
warm
toward
her
i
began
to
feel
bewitched
myself
from
the
first
moment
that
godmother
spoke
to
me
she
called
me
elizabeth
and
at
home
i
am
just
plain
betty
oh
i
think
it
is
perfectly
beautiful
to
have
a
godmother
she
looked
shyly
up
at
the
face
above
her
with
such
a
winning
smile
that
sherman
drew
her
toward
her
with
a
quick
hug
and
kiss
lloyd
gave
a
little
wriggle
of
satisfaction
i
glad
you
come
she
cried
so
completely
won
by
betty
artlessness
that
she
forgot
her
first
impression
heah
we
are
at
locust
she
said
as
they
drove
into
the
long
avenue
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
trees
when
they
were
all
in
bloom
it
was
like
a
picture
it
is
like
a
picture
now
i
think
said
betty
gazing
up
at
the
giant
branches
overheard
that
seemed
to
be
waving
a
welcome
there
was
a
listening
expression
on
her
face
as
if
she
understood
their
leafy
whisperings
lloyd
and
her
mother
exchanged
glances
and
after
that
she
was
disturbed
by
no
word
until
the
carriage
stopped
they
understood
her
silent
pleasure
in
the
great
trees
that
they
themselves
had
learned
to
look
upon
as
old
friends
at
the
house
betty
leaned
forward
for
an
admiring
glance
at
the
tall
white
pillars
all
wreathed
and
festooned
in
their
green
lacework
of
vines
oh
i
know
this
place
she
cried
it
is
in
my
progress
where
christian
stopped
awhile
on
his
way
to
the
city
of
the
shining
ones
it
is
the
house
beautiful
what
odd
fancies
you
have
exclaimed
lloyd
stepping
out
of
the
carriage
as
she
spoke
but
it
is
dear
of
you
to
give
the
place
such
a
sweet
name
come
on
up
and
see
your
room
after
you
have
rested
awhile
i
take
you
all
over
the
house
as
they
went
down
the
wide
airy
hall
betty
had
a
glimpse
of
the
through
the
open
doors
in
a
confused
way
she
noticed
mirrors
and
statuary
and
portraits
handsome
old
furniture
and
rare
pieces
of
but
one
thing
caught
her
attention
so
that
she
stood
a
moment
in
admiration
it
was
a
large
harp
whose
gracefully
curving
frame
gleamed
through
the
shadowy
room
like
burnished
gold
fair
and
tall
it
stood
as
if
its
strings
had
just
been
swept
by
some
of
the
shining
ones
beyond
who
were
a
part
of
the
pilgrim
dream
what
did
you
say
asked
lloyd
hearing
her
cry
of
admiration
and
looking
back
to
see
betty
standing
in
the
open
door
with
clasped
hands
oh
that
is
grandmothah
harp
i
am
learning
to
play
on
it
to
please
grandfathah
i
teach
you
some
chords
while
you
are
heah
if
you
want
me
to
come
on
at
the
landing
where
the
stairs
turned
betty
stopped
again
for
there
was
a
great
casement
window
looking
out
into
a
and
under
it
a
cosy
cushioned
where
some
one
had
evidently
been
reading
there
were
books
and
magazines
scattered
all
among
the
pillows
heah
is
yo
room
cried
lloyd
throwing
open
a
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
leading
the
way
in
betty
followed
her
sunbonnet
in
her
hand
and
looked
around
her
like
one
in
a
dream
she
had
never
imagined
a
room
could
be
so
beautiful
if
lloyd
could
have
known
what
a
contrast
it
was
to
the
bare
little
west
gable
at
the
cuckoo
nest
she
could
have
better
understood
the
wonder
in
betty
face
my
room
is
pink
and
eugenia
green
and
joyce
blue
explained
lloyd
mothah
thought
you
would
like
this
white
and
gold
one
best
it
like
a
daisy
field
before
betty
could
express
her
admiration
sherman
came
in
with
an
old
coloured
woman
whom
she
called
mom
beck
and
who
she
told
betty
had
been
her
own
nurse
as
well
as
lloyd
and
she
is
anxious
to
see
you
added
sherman
for
she
remembers
your
mamma
so
well
many
a
time
she
helped
dress
her
when
she
was
a
little
girl
no
larger
than
you
and
came
home
with
me
for
a
visit
she
bring
you
some
milk
or
iced
tea
and
fix
your
bath
when
you
are
ready
for
it
we
are
going
to
leave
you
now
for
a
little
while
and
see
if
you
ca
have
a
nice
little
nap
it
has
been
a
long
tiresome
journey
and
you
need
the
rest
more
than
you
realise
left
to
herself
betty
undressed
and
lay
down
as
she
had
been
bidden
her
eyes
were
tired
and
she
closed
them
sleepily
but
they
would
not
stay
shut
she
was
obliged
to
open
them
for
another
peep
at
the
dear
little
white
with
its
crystal
candlesticks
that
looked
like
twisted
icicles
and
she
must
see
that
darling
little
again
and
all
the
dainty
toilet
articles
of
gold
and
ivory
then
she
could
not
resist
another
glance
at
the
white
angora
rugs
lying
on
the
dark
polished
floor
and
the
white
screen
before
her
with
sprays
of
goldenrod
painted
across
it
looking
as
natural
as
if
they
had
grown
there
once
she
got
up
and
pattered
across
the
room
in
her
nightgown
to
sit
a
moment
before
the
little
in
the
corner
and
handle
all
its
dainty
furnishings
of
gold
and
there
were
thin
white
curtains
at
the
windows
held
back
by
broad
bands
of
yellow
ribbon
they
stirred
softly
with
every
passing
breeze
and
fluttered
and
fluttered
until
by
and
by
watching
them
betty
eyelids
fluttered
too
and
she
closed
them
drowsily
while
she
slept
she
dreamed
that
she
was
back
in
the
cuckoo
nest
again
in
her
bare
little
room
in
the
gable
and
that
a
great
white
and
yellow
daisy
stood
over
her
shaking
her
by
the
shoulder
and
telling
her
that
it
was
time
to
go
down
and
wash
the
breakfast
dishes
then
the
broad
white
petals
began
to
fall
off
one
by
one
and
it
was
davy
face
in
the
centre
no
whose
was
it
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
looked
again
to
find
her
godmother
standing
in
the
door
it
is
time
to
dress
for
dinner
little
girl
she
called
gaily
do
you
need
any
help
no
thank
you
answered
betty
sitting
up
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
lloyd
going
past
the
door
in
a
fresh
white
muslin
and
pink
ribbons
shall
i
wear
my
best
dress
godmother
asked
betty
or
would
it
be
better
to
save
it
for
sunday
let
me
see
it
said
sherman
helping
her
to
take
it
out
of
the
little
trunk
oh
you
better
wear
it
i
think
we
may
have
company
what
she
saw
in
that
trunk
set
her
to
thinking
her
most
godmotherly
thoughts
the
wax
tapers
were
all
lighted
in
each
silver
candelabra
when
betty
went
down
the
stairs
looking
fresh
and
sweet
as
a
wildflower
in
her
dress
and
ribbons
of
blue
when
she
slipped
into
the
long
lloyd
was
playing
on
the
harp
over
her
hung
the
portrait
of
a
beautiful
young
girl
also
standing
beside
a
harp
she
was
dressed
in
white
and
she
wore
a
june
rose
in
her
hair
and
another
at
her
throat
betty
walked
over
and
looked
up
at
the
picture
long
and
earnestly
that
my
grandmothah
amanthis
said
lloyd
pausing
in
her
song
and
that
the
way
she
looked
the
first
time
grandfathah
evah
saw
her
and
heah
uncle
tom
in
his
soldier
clothes
and
this
is
that
was
such
a
belle
in
the
days
of
clay
and
webstah
she
led
the
way
around
the
room
introducing
betty
to
all
the
old
family
portraits
with
interesting
tales
about
each
one
then
she
went
back
to
her
harp
and
betty
sat
down
in
front
of
the
first
picture
again
you
belong
to
me
too
in
a
way
thought
betty
looking
up
at
it
if
you
are
my
godmother
mother
then
you
are
my
amanthis
and
i
love
you
because
you
are
so
beautiful
the
harp
thrilled
on
the
fair
face
of
the
portrait
seemed
to
smile
back
at
her
and
in
some
vague
sweet
way
betty
felt
that
she
had
come
back
to
her
own
and
had
been
welcomed
home
to
the
house
beautiful
chapter
vi
the
enchanted
necklace
several
days
after
betty
arrival
the
little
colonel
went
into
her
mother
room
with
a
troubled
face
mothah
she
said
anxiously
what
are
we
goin
to
do
about
the
lawn
fête
at
anna
moore
this
afternoon
elizabeth
has
a
thing
to
weah
but
that
lawn
dress
that
she
has
put
on
every
evenin
since
she
came
and
it
is
fresh
enough
i
ca
lend
her
anything
because
i
not
quite
as
tall
as
she
is
and
my
clothes
would
be
too
short
what
is
she
goin
to
do
ah
that
is
my
secret
little
daughter
answered
sherman
with
a
smile
what
do
you
suppose
i
spent
that
hot
morning
in
town
for
the
day
after
she
came

six
trips

it
to
get
some
clothes
made
for

asked
lloyd
a
little
expression
of
doubt
showed
in
the
anxious
pucker
of
her
forehead
but
mothah
she
is
awfully
proud
if
she
is
poah
are
you
afraid
of
hurtin
her
feelin
there
are
a
great
many
ways
of
giving
gifts
little
daughter
if
i
provided
her
with
clothes
in
a
way
to
make
her
feel
that
i
thought
hers
were
too
mean
to
be
worn
in
my
house
and
that
i
was
ashamed
to
have
a
guest
of
mine
present
such
an
appearance
that
would
naturally
hurt
her
pride
but
i
have
thought
of
a
way

her

you
will
call
her

a
few
minutes
i
will

lloyd
hung
over
the
banister
in
the
upper
hall
until
she
heard
a
whispered
ready
then
she
called
come
up
heah
elizabeth
mothah
wants
us
a
minute
in
yo
room
sherman
was
sitting
by
an
open
window
with
some
sewing
in
her
lap
when
lloyd
and
betty
skipped
into
the
white
and
gold
room
betty
had
a
book
in
her
hand
with
her
finger
between
the
closed
pages
to
keep
the
place
illustration
betty
began
the
story
elizabeth
said
sherman
do
you
remember
the
story
of
the
enchanted
necklace
that
was
in
a
book
of
fairy
tales
i
sent
you
once
oh
yes
cried
betty
that
is
one
of
my
favourite
stories
i
have
read
it
twenty
times
i
am
sure
and
told
it
to
davy
until
he
almost
knows
it
by
heart
i
wish
you
would
tell
it
to
lloyd
please
she
has
never
heard
it
and
i
want
to
illustrate
it
for
her
after
awhile
the
little
girl
willingly
dropped
down
into
a
big
chair
full
of
cushions
and
with
her
finger
still
marking
the
place
in
the
book
betty
began
the
story
once
upon
a
time
near
a
castle
in
a
lonely
wood
there
lived
an
orphan
maiden
named
olga
she
would
have
been
all
alone
in
the
world
had
it
not
been
for
an
old
woman
who
befriended
her
this
woman
was
an
old
and
lived
in
a
humble
thatched
cottage
near
the
castle
she
had
taken
pity
on
olga
when
the
little
orphan
was
a
helpless
baby
and
so
kind
had
she
always
been
that
olga
had
grown
to
maidenhood
without
feeling
the
lack
of
father
mother
brother
or
sister
in
all
ways
the
old
flax
spinner
had
taken
their
places
every
morning
olga
carried
water
from
the
spring
gathered
the
wild
fruits
of
the
woods
and
spread
the
linen
on
the
grass
to
bleach
this
she
did
to
help
the
old
woman
for
she
had
a
good
and
grateful
heart
as
well
as
a
beautiful
face
one
day
as
olga
was
wandering
by
the
spring
searching
for
watercresses
the
young
prince
of
the
castle
rode
by
on
his
prancing
charger
a
plume
waved
in
his
hat
and
a
shining
silver
bugle
hung
from
his
shoulder
for
he
had
been
following
the
chase
he
was
thirsty
and
tired
and
asked
for
a
drink
but
there
was
no
cup
from
which
to
dip
the
water
from
the
spring
but
olga
caught
the
drops
as
they
bubbled
out
from
the
spring
holding
it
in
the
hollow
of
her
beautiful
white
hands
and
reaching
up
to
where
he
sat
offered
him
the
sparkling
water
so
gracefully
was
it
done
that
the
prince
was
charmed
by
her
lovely
face
and
modest
manner
and
baring
his
head
when
he
had
slaked
his
thirst
he
touched
the
white
hands
with
his
lips
before
he
rode
away
he
asked
her
name
and
where
she
lived
the
next
day
a
courier
in
scarlet
and
gold
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
and
invited
olga
to
the
castle
princesses
and
royal
ladies
from
all
over
the
realm
were
to
be
entertained
there
seven
days
and
seven
nights
every
night
a
grand
ball
was
to
be
given
and
olga
was
summoned
to
each
of
the
balls
it
was
on
account
of
her
pleasing
manner
and
her
great
beauty
that
she
had
been
bidden
the
old
curtsied
low
to
the
courier
and
promised
that
olga
should
be
at
the
castle
without
fail
good
dame
cried
olga
when
the
courier
had
gone
tell
me
why
thou
didst
make
such
a
promise
when
thou
knowest
full
well
this
gown
of
tow
is
all
i
own
wouldst
have
me
stand
before
the
prince
in
beggar
garb
better
to
bide
at
home
for
aye
than
be
put
to
shame
before
such
guests
done
my
child
the
old
dame
said
shalt
wear
a
court
robe
of
the
finest
years
have
i
toiled
to
give
it
thee
but
that
is
naught
i
loved
thee
as
my
own
then
the
old
dame
went
into
an
inner
room
and
pricked
herself
with
her
spindle
until
a
great
red
drop
of
her
heart
blood
fell
into
her
trembling
hand
with
witchery
of
words
she
blew
upon
it
and
rolled
it
in
her
palm
and
muttering
turned
and
turned
and
turned
it
and
as
the
spell
was
laid
upon
it
it
shrivelled
it
into
a
tiny
round
ball
like
a
seed
and
she
strung
it
on
to
a
thread
where
were
many
others
like
it
seventy
times
seven
was
the
number
of
beads
on
this
strange
rosary
then
she
laid
it
away
until
the
time
when
it
should
be
needed
when
the
night
of
the
first
ball
rolled
around
olga
combed
her
long
golden
hair
and
twined
it
with
a
wreath
of
snowy
and
then
she
stood
before
the
old
dame
in
her
dress
of
tow
to
her
wonderment
and
grief
she
saw
the
old
had
no
silken
robe
in
waiting
only
a
string
of
beads
which
she
clasped
around
olga
white
throat
each
bead
in
the
necklace
looked
like
a
little
shrivelled
seed
and
olga
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
of
disappointment
me
and
all
will
be
well
said
the
old
dame
thou
reachest
the
castle
gate
clasp
one
bead
in
thy
fingers
and
say
for
love
sweet
sake
in
my
hour
of
need
blossom
and
deck
me
little
seed
right
royally
shalt
thou
be
clad
thou
hast
been
a
good
daughter
to
me
and
thus
i
reward
thee
but
remember
carefully
the
charm
only
to
the
magic
words
for
love
sweet
sake
will
the
necklace
give
up
its
treasures
if
thou
shouldst
forget
then
must
thou
be
doomed
alway
to
bear
thy
gown
of
tow
so
olga
sped
on
her
way
through
the
forest
until
she
came
to
the
castle
gate
there
she
paused
and
grasping
a
bead
of
the
strange
necklace
between
her
fingers
repeated
the
old
dame
charm
love
sweet
sake
in
my
hour
of
need
blossom
and
deck
me
little
seed
immediately
the
bead
burst
with
a
little
puff
as
if
a
seed
pod
had
snapped
asunder
a
faint
perfume
surrounded
her
rare
and
subtle
as
if
it
had
been
blown
across
from
some
flower
of
eden
olga
looked
down
and
found
herself
enveloped
in
a
robe
of
such
delicate
texture
that
it
seemed
soft
as
a
rose
leaf
and
as
airy
as
the
pink
clouds
that
sometimes
float
across
the
sunset
the
in
her
hair
had
become
a
coronal
of
opals
when
she
entered
the
great
ballroom
the
prince
of
the
castle
started
up
from
his
throne
in
amazement
never
before
had
he
seen
such
a
vision
of
loveliness
said
he
rose
of
paradise
hath
found
a
soul
and
drifted
earthward
to
blossom
here
and
all
that
night
he
had
eyes
for
none
but
her
the
next
night
olga
started
again
to
the
castle
in
her
dress
of
tow
and
at
the
gate
she
grasped
the
second
bead
in
her
fingers
repeating
the
charm
this
time
the
pale
yellow
of
the
daffodils
seemed
to
have
woven
itself
into
a
cloth
of
gold
for
her
adorning
it
was
like
a
shimmer
of
moonbeams
and
her
hair
held
the
diamond
flashings
of
a
hundred
tiny
stars
that
night
the
prince
paid
her
so
many
compliments
and
singled
her
out
so
often
to
bestow
his
favours
that
olga
head
was
turned
she
tossed
it
proudly
and
quite
scorned
the
thought
of
the
humble
cottage
which
had
given
her
shelter
so
long
the
next
day
when
she
had
returned
to
her
gown
of
tow
and
was
no
longer
a
haughty
court
lady
but
only
olga
the
maiden
she
repined
at
her
lot
frowning
she
carried
the
water
from
the
spring
frowning
she
gathered
the
cresses
and
plucked
the
woodland
fruit
and
then
she
sat
all
day
by
the
spring
refusing
to
spread
the
linen
on
the
grass
to
bleach
she
was
discontented
with
the
old
life
of
toil
and
pouted
crossly
because
duties
called
her
when
she
wanted
to
do
nothing
but
sit
idly
dreaming
of
the
gay
court
scenes
in
which
she
had
taken
a
bright
brief
part
the
old
fingers
trembled
as
she
spun
when
she
saw
the
frowns
for
she
had
given
of
her
heart
blood
to
buy
happiness
for
the
maiden
she
loved
and
well
she
knew
there
can
be
no
happiness
where
frowns
abide
she
felt
that
her
years
of
sacrifice
had
been
in
vain
that
night
outside
the
castle
gate
olga
paused
she
had
forgotten
the
charm
the
day
discontent
had
darkened
her
memory
as
storm
clouds
darken
the
sky
but
she
grasped
her
necklace
imperiously
me
at
once
she
cried
in
a
haughty
tone
me
more
beautifully
than
mortal
maid
was
ever
clad
before
so
that
i
may
find
favour
in
the
prince
sight
and
become
the
bride
of
the
castle
i
would
that
i
were
done
for
ever
with
the
spindle
and
the
distaff
but
the
moon
went
under
a
cloud
and
the
wind
began
to
moan
around
the
turrets
the
black
night
hawks
in
the
forests
flapped
their
wings
warningly
and
the
black
bats
flitted
low
around
her
head
me
at
once
she
cried
angrily
stamping
her
foot
and
jerking
at
the
necklace
but
the
string
broke
and
the
beads
went
rolling
away
in
the
darkness
in
every
direction
and
were
lost
all
but
one
which
she
held
clasped
in
her
hand
then
olga
wept
at
the
castle
gate
wept
outside
in
the
night
and
the
darkness
in
her
beggar
garb
of
tow
but
after
awhile
through
her
sobbing
stole
the
answering
sob
of
the
night
wind
it
seemed
to
say
never
a
heart
can
come
to
harm
if
the
lips
but
speak
the
old
dame
charm
the
voice
of
the
night
wind
sounded
so
much
like
the
voice
of
the
old
that
olga
was
startled
and
looked
around
wonderingly
then
suddenly
she
seemed
to
see
the
little
thatched
cottage
and
the
bent
form
of
the
lonely
old
woman
at
the
wheel
all
the
years
in
which
the
good
dame
had
befriended
her
seemed
to
rise
up
in
a
row
and
out
of
each
one
called
a
thousand
kindnesses
as
with
one
voice
canst
thou
forget
us
olga
we
were
done
for
thee
for
love
sweet
sake
and
that
alone
then
was
olga
sorry
and
ashamed
that
she
had
been
so
proud
and
forgetful
and
she
wept
again
the
tears
seemed
to
clear
her
vision
for
now
she
saw
plainly
that
through
no
power
of
her
own
could
she
wrest
strange
favours
from
fortune
only
the
power
of
the
old
charm
could
make
them
hers
she
remembered
it
then
and
holding
fast
to
the
one
bead
in
her
hand
she
repeated
humbly
love
sweet
sake
in
my
hour
of
need
blossom
and
deck
me
little
seed
lo
as
the
words
left
her
lips
the
moon
shone
out
from
behind
the
clouds
above
the
dark
forest
there
was
a
fragrance
of
lilies
all
about
her
and
a
gossamer
gown
floated
around
her
whiter
than
the
whiteness
of
the
fairest
lily
it
was
fine
like
the
finest
lace
that
the
weave
and
softer
than
the
softest
ermine
of
the
snow
on
her
long
golden
hair
gleamed
a
coronet
of
pearls
so
beautiful
so
dazzling
was
she
as
she
entered
the
castle
door
that
the
prince
came
down
to
meet
her
and
kneeling
kissed
her
hand
and
claimed
her
as
his
bride
then
came
the
bishop
in
his
mitre
and
led
her
to
the
throne
and
before
them
all
the
maiden
was
married
to
the
prince
and
made
the
princess
olga
then
until
the
seven
days
and
seven
nights
were
done
the
revels
lasted
in
the
castle
and
in
the
merriment
the
old
was
again
forgotten
her
kindness
of
the
past
her
loneliness
in
the
present
had
no
part
in
the
thoughts
of
the
princess
olga
but
the
beads
that
had
rolled
away
into
the
darkness
buried
themselves
in
the
earth
and
took
root
and
sprang
up
there
at
the
castle
gate
they
bloomed
a
strange
strange
flower
for
on
every
stem
hung
a
row
of
little
bleeding
hearts
one
day
the
princess
olga
seeing
them
from
her
window
went
down
to
them
in
wonderment
do
you
here
she
cried
for
in
her
lonely
forest
life
she
had
learned
all
speech
of
bird
and
beast
and
plant
bloom
for
love
sweet
sake
they
answered
have
sprung
from
the
old
gift
the
necklace
thou
didst
break
and
scatter
from
her
heart
best
blood
she
gave
it
and
her
heart
still
bleeds
to
think
she
is
forgotten
then
they
began
to
tell
the
story
of
the
old
dame
sacrifices
all
the
seventy
times
seven
that
she
had
made
for
the
sake
of
the
maiden
and
olga
grieved
as
she
listened
that
she
could
have
been
so
ungrateful
then
she
brought
the
prince
to
listen
to
the
story
of
the
strange
strange
flowers
and
when
he
had
heard
together
they
went
to
the
lowly
cottage
and
fetched
the
old
to
the
castle
there
to
live
out
all
her
days
and
still
the
flowers
that
we
call
bleeding
hearts
bloom
on
by
cottage
walls
and
castle
gardens
reminding
us
how
often
is
through
hearts
that
bleed
for
love
sweet
sake
we
reach
our
happiness
betty
came
to
the
end
of
the
story
and
paused
smiling
while
the
little
colonel
who
had
listened
with
one
arm
around
her
mother
neck
waited
for
what
was
to
follow
sherman
took
up
a
little
box
that
had
been
lying
in
her
lap
under
the
sewing
and
lifted
something
out
of
the
jeweller
cotton
it
contained
elizabeth
she
asked
motioning
the
child
toward
her
do
you
suppose
the
princess
olga
necklace
was
anything
like
this
what
she
held
up
was
a
string
of
little
gold
beads
oh
they
are
almost
like
mine
cried
lloyd
fingering
them
admiringly
before
betty
realised
what
was
coming
she
found
them
clasped
on
her
neck
and
sherman
was
saying
it
is
made
out
of
my
blood
by
any
means
and
it
will
not
lead
you
to
any
prince
charming
but
it
is
my
privilege
as
godmother
to
lay
a
spell
on
them
let
see
how
it
will
work
go
over
to
that
little
trunk
of
yours
in
the
corner
dear
and
lay
your
hand
on
it
now
shut
your
eyes
while
you
repeat
charm
and
see
what
will
happen
delighted
by
this
dramatising
of
the
old
tale
betty
scrambled
to
her
feet
ran
across
the
room
and
laid
her
hand
on
top
of
the
shabby
little
leather
trunk
shutting
her
eyes
so
tight
that
her
nose
wrinkled
up
like
a
kitten
while
her
mouth
smiled
broadly
she
repeated
the
rhyme
for
love
sweet
sake
in
my
hour
of
need
blossom
and
deck
me
little
seed
as
she
opened
her
eyes
lloyd
obeying
a
whisper
from
her
mother
threw
back
the
lid
of
the
trunk
all
that
betty
could
utter
as
she
looked
within
was
a
cry
of
surprise
there
inside
lay
a
pile
of
light
summer
dresses
some
white
and
the
rest
in
as
many
tints
of
pale
pinks
and
blues
and
buffs
and
lilacs
as
could
be
found
in
a
bunch
of
fresh
sweet
peas
below
were
glimpses
of
linen
and
lace
and
embroidery
and
in
the
top
tray
two
pretty
hats
one
trimmed
simply
with
rosettes
of
ribbon
the
other
a
leghorn
with
a
wreath
of
one
look
into
betty
face
was
enough
reward
for
sherman
it
was
ample
return
for
all
the
trouble
she
had
taken
what
was
the
money
expended
and
the
discomforts
of
that
tiresome
morning
that
she
shopped
in
town
or
the
many
trips
to
the
dressmaker
compared
to
the
rapture
in
betty
shining
eyes
sherman
had
never
seen
such
happiness
or
heard
such
a
gladness
in
a
voice
as
when
betty
cried
out
oh
godmother
are
you
a
witch
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
i
thought
i
was
coming
to
an
ordinary
house
party
and
i
walked
straight
into
a
real
live
fairy
tale
oh
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
never
never
never
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
godmother
neck
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
presently
leaving
betty
to
gloat
over
her
treasures
by
herself
lloyd
followed
sherman
out
of
the
room
now
i
see
what
you
meant
mothah
she
said
about
the
different
ways
of
givin
things
it
hurt
anybody
pride
if
you
make
them
feel
that
you
give
it
for
sweet
sake
that
was
a
beautiful
way
you
did
it
mothah
and
i
never
it
chapter
vii
bits
from
betty
diary
the
locusts
june
this
morning
when
i
sat
down
at
my
to
finish
a
letter
to
davy
i
found
this
little
blank
book
bound
in
white
kid
with
my
initials
on
the
back
in
gold
letters
when
i
first
came
godmother
heard
me
wishing
that
i
could
put
a
slice
of
my
good
times
away
in
a
box
every
day
and
save
it
to
take
home
and
enjoy
afterward
as
people
do
sometimes
after
christmases
and
weddings
so
she
has
given
me
this
pretty
white
book
and
every
day
while
i
am
in
this
house
beautiful
i
shall
write
something
in
it
with
this
darling
little
pen
even
if
i
should
live
to
be
a
grandmother
i
am
sure
i
shall
never
be
too
old
to
enjoy
reading
the
account
of
what
we
did
at
this
house
party
so
far
i
am
the
only
guest
the
others
will
be
here
in
a
few
days
they
have
so
much
farther
to
travel
than
i
had
cousin
hetty
would
say
that
i
am
eating
my
white
bread
now
for
it
is
nothing
but
play
from
morning
until
night
at
first
it
seemed
so
strange
no
beds
to
make
no
dishes
to
wash
no
churning
to
do
i
like
the
evenings
best
of
all
then
we
sit
on
the
porch
in
the
twilight
and
godmother
talks
about
mamma
i
never
knew
anything
about
her
before
for
i
was
so
little
when
she
died
but
now
she
seems
so
real
to
me
and
so
sweet
then
we
go
into
the
long
and
the
wax
tapers
are
lighted
godmother
says
she
always
intends
to
use
in
that
room
because
it
would
spoil
some
of
its
quaint
charm
to
use
modern
lights
and
she
plays
on
the
piano
and
lloyd
on
the
harp
lloyd
is
only
learning
and
godmother
does
seem
to
think
much
of
her
playing
but
to
me
the
music
they
make
seems
almost
heavenly
they
forget
that
the
only
music
that
i
am
used
to
hearing
except
what
the
birds
make
is
pumped
out
of
the
wheezy
little
organ
at
church
i
could
sit
up
all
night
to
listen
to
them
it
makes
me
feel
so
strange
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
describe
it
as
if
i
were
away
off
from
everything
and
high
up
where
it
is
wide
and
open
and
where
the
stars
are
it
makes
me
want
to
write
all
sorts
of
beautiful
thoughts
come
to
me
that
i
can
put
into
words
but
they
are
like
when
i
get
to
the
place
with
my
rhyme
where
i
saw
them
shining
they
are
still
beyond
my
reach
june
rob
moore
came
over
and
he
and
lloyd
and
i
went
fishing
we
carried
our
lunch
with
us
and
ate
it
on
a
big
rock
that
sticks
up
like
a
sort
of
island
in
the
middle
of
the
creek
we
had
to
take
off
our
shoes
and
stockings
to
wade
out
to
it
and
after
we
got
there
the
rock
was
hardly
big
enough
to
hold
the
basket
and
all
of
us
comfortably
we
had
to
hold
fast
with
one
hand
and
grab
for
our
sandwiches
with
the
other
it
was
lots
of
fun
for
rob
and
lloyd
kept
saying
such
funny
things
that
we
laughed
all
the
time
i
do
know
how
it
happened
but
we
got
to
laughing
so
hard
that
lloyd
choked
on
a
piece
of
chicken
we
began
pounding
her
on
the
back
to
help
her
get
her
breath
and
all
of
a
sudden
off
we
went
from
the
rock
into
the
creek
kersplash
it
was
deep
enough
to
hurt
us
but
we
did
look
so
funny
when
we
stood
up
as
wet
as
three
frogs
and
wiped
the
water
out
of
our
eyes
we
laughed
so
hard
we
could
scarcely
fish
the
basket
out
of
the
creek
and
wade
to
shore
the
basket
was
the
only
thing
we
caught
except
a
turtle
rob
got
that
and
lloyd
made
him
let
it
go
again
of
course
our
tumble
into
the
water
ended
the
fishing
for
for
we
all
had
to
hurry
home
for
dry
clothes
but
rob
came
back
again
in
the
afternoon
and
he
and
lloyd
have
been
giving
me
my
first
lesson
in
june
joyce
came
on
the
noon
train
she
has
the
blue
room
across
the
hall
from
mine
it
suits
her
for
she
is
a
blonde
like
lloyd
but
her
hair
does
curl
any
it
is
just
soft
and
wavy
and
hangs
in
two
long
braids
below
her
waist
her
eyes
are
gray
with
long
dark
lashes
and
while
she
is
exactly
pretty
she
has
a
face
that
you
like
to
keep
looking
at
it
is
so
bright
and
jolly
as
if
she
was
always
thinking
funny
things
and
having
a
good
time
all
to
herself
she
came
all
the
way
alone
and
did
mind
it
a
bit
although
she
had
to
change
cars
twice
and
was
all
night
on
the
she
brought
a
in
her
satchel
that
is
almost
full
of
pictures
she
drew
on
the
train
there
is
one
that
is
so
funny
it
is
the
head
of
an
old
man
gone
to
sleep
with
his
mouth
open
she
wrote
under
that
one
as
others
see
us
then
she
drew
two
cunning
babies
playing
in
the
aisle
she
called
that
innocence
abroad
there
are
ever
so
many
more
that
godmother
says
are
really
clever
and
remarkably
well
done
for
a
girl
of
thirteen
i
thought
they
were
perfect
it
did
take
long
to
get
acquainted
with
joyce
she
has
been
here
only
a
part
of
a
day
and
already
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
her
always
june
it
was
nearly
six
yesterday
when
eugenia
came
godmother
and
lloyd
drove
down
to
the
station
to
meet
her
but
joyce
and
i
walked
up
and
down
under
the
locusts
wondering
what
she
would
be
like
we
could
hardly
wait
for
the
carriage
to
come
we
were
so
eager
to
know
i
could
tell
what
it
was
about
her
but
somehow
when
she
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
and
shook
hands
with
us
she
made
me
feel
awkward
and
shy
and
out
of
place
maybe
it
was
because
she
had
such
a
manner
and
seemed
so
although
she
is
only
joyce
age
then
she
spoke
in
such
a
superior
sort
of
way
to
her
maid
when
she
ordered
her
to
follow
with
the
satchels
they
went
straight
to
the
green
room
to
dress
for
dinner
and
joyce
and
i
locked
arms
again
and
strolled
down
to
the
gate
joyce
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
her
i
told
her
that
i
would
be
thankful
to
the
end
of
time
that
i
got
here
first
seeing
her
arrive
in
such
a
stylish
travelling
suit
gloves
and
knox
hat
and
carrying
such
a
handsome
leather
bag
opened
my
eyes
to
the
way
i
must
have
looked
when
i
came
it
tickled
joyce
the
way
i
described
myself
travelling
in
a
sunbonnet
and
carrying
my
belongings
in
an
willow
basket
she
gave
my
chin
a
soft
nip
and
kissed
rue
on
each
cheek
and
said
you
funny
little
bettykins
as
if
it
made
any
difference
to
your
friends
what
you
wore
i
told
her
i
believed
it
would
make
a
difference
to
eugenia
and
she
thought
too
that
maybe
it
might
then
i
told
her
i
believed
that
was
why
godmother
gave
me
the
enchanted
necklace
before
she
came
so
that
i
would
feel
uncomfortable
joyce
had
not
heard
about
the
necklace
so
i
showed
her
my
gold
beads
and
told
her
their
story
she
thought
it
was
lovely
of
godmother
to
make
the
fairy
tale
come
true
but
she
advised
me
not
to
tell
eugenia
girls
who
always
travel
in
private
cars
and
have
everything
they
wish
for
she
said
ca
understand
what
it
means
to
be
poor
then
she
told
me
about
a
box
that
her
cousin
kate
had
sent
her
and
how
good
it
made
everybody
in
the
little
brown
house
feel
when
it
came
june
we
had
the
grandest
surprise
this
morning
lloyd
came
up
to
the
house
soon
after
breakfast
on
tarbaby
leading
her
mother
riding
horse
a
graceful
little
bay
mare
behind
her
came
one
of
the
coloured
men
leading
two
ponies
so
that
we
could
all
have
a
ride
the
bay
mare
was
for
eugenia
who
is
a
fine
horsewoman
she
learned
in
a
new
york
the
ponies
were
for
joyce
and
me
sherman
had
them
sent
out
from
louisville
after
he
went
away
for
us
to
use
all
the
time
we
are
here
one
of
the
ponies
is
named
calico
because
he
is
marked
so
queerly
his
hair
grows
in
such
funny
little
streaks
and
stripes
and
patches
that
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
painted
that
way
on
purpose
he
was
a
clown
pony
in
a
circus
one
time
and
is
supposed
to
know
a
lot
of
tricks
joyce
wanted
him
because
he
is
so
gentle
and
she
had
never
ridden
any
before
she
did
mind
his
ridiculous
looks
so
lad
fell
to
my
share
a
pretty
brown
one
that
is
as
easy
as
a
after
the
old
that
i
am
used
to
bouncing
around
on
at
home
they
were
all
ready
to
start
so
we
went
galloping
down
to
judge
after
rob
and
the
five
of
us
raced
all
over
the
valley
till
nearly
it
was
grand
the
dust
flew
and
people
ran
to
the
windows
when
we
went
by
as
if
we
had
been
a
circus
we
did
have
a
sort
of
circus
when
we
passed
by
taylor
grove
a
butchers
union
had
come
out
from
town
for
a
big
picnic
and
they
had
a
brass
band
with
them
it
struck
up
a
waltz
just
as
we
reached
the
grove
and
joyce
pony
calico
began
turning
around
and
around
as
if
he
had
lost
his
senses
joyce
screamed
and
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
frightened
almost
to
death
until
rob
called
out
that
calico
was
dancing
and
for
her
to
hang
on
and
see
what
he
would
do
what
he
did
was
to
stand
on
his
hind
legs
and
dump
joyce
off
into
the
middle
of
the
road
she
sat
there
in
the
dust
too
astonished
to
move
until
rob
helped
her
up
and
then
they
both
leaned
against
the
fence
to
laugh
at
antics
he
was
so
funny
he
kept
up
his
performances
until
the
music
stopped
then
he
walked
over
to
rob
and
held
up
his
fore
foot
to
shake
hands
as
if
he
wanted
to
be
congratulated
the
music
of
the
band
seemed
to
have
brought
back
all
his
old
tricks
to
his
memory
i
did
suppose
that
joyce
would
mount
him
again
but
she
did
rob
called
to
the
men
and
asked
them
please
not
to
play
again
until
we
were
out
of
hearing
and
we
rode
off
june
i
do
believe
that
i
could
ever
love
eugenia
very
dearly
because
she
makes
me
feel
uncomfortable
so
often
she
has
a
way
of
looking
down
on
you
that
would
rile
anybody
but
she
is
a
fascinating
sort
of
girl
when
she
wants
to
be
friendly
and
entertaining
we
have
been
in
her
room
all
morning
listening
to
her
talk
it
must
be
grand
to
live
in
one
of
the
biggest
hotels
in
the
world
and
see
all
the
sights
she
sees
i
imagine
it
is
a
sort
of
a
palace
she
showed
us
the
picture
of
her
three
best
friends
at
school
it
is
in
a
big
silver
locket
set
with
sapphires
and
hangs
over
a
corner
of
her
mirror
we
heard
a
great
deal
of
them
this
morning
she
seems
to
think
more
of
that
mollie
and
fay
and
kell
than
she
does
of
her
father
it
is
funny
that
when
you
are
with
eugenia
you
ca
help
feeling
the
same
way
she
does
about
what
she
telling
that
it
is
right
to
break
the
rules
and
skip
recitations
and
torment
the
teachers
and
play
jokes
on
the
girls
not
in
their
set
she
seems
to
have
a
great
influence
over
lloyd
i
do
believe
godmother
would
like
it
if
she
knew
how
much
already
lloyd
has
promised
to
tease
her
father
and
mother
into
letting
her
go
to
new
york
next
fall
to
enter
eugenia
school
she
told
us
that
it
is
very
select
and
said
you
know
sometimes
schools
that
advertise
themselves
as
being
awfully
select
are
no
better
than
those
horrid
public
schools
for
they
take
anybody
who
applies
no
matter
how
common
they
are
joyce
asked
her
why
she
called
public
schools
horrid
and
she
answered
in
such
a
disgusted
patronising
way
oh
nobody
who
anybody
would
go
to
a
public
school
that
made
joyce
mad
and
she
told
her
that
she
went
to
one
and
that
she
was
proud
of
it
that
where
she
lived
public
schools
were
considered
better
than
the
private
ones
they
had
better
teachers
and
more
progressive
methods
and
she
said
she
would
give
up
the
plainsville
high
school
for
all
the
select
seminaries
in
new
york
then
eugenia
drawled
in
a
bored
tone
oh
you
well
maybe
would
being
from
the
west
you
know
i
always
heard
it
spoken
of
out
there
as
wild
and
woolly
and
i
suppose
it
is
all
a
matter
of
taste
then
she
gave
a
provoking
little
laugh
and
began
to
hum
a
tune
as
if
public
schools
and
people
who
went
to
them
were
too
common
for
her
to
think
about
joyce
looked
out
of
the
window
with
a
sort
of
expression
and
said
something
in
french
of
course
i
understand
it
but
she
told
me
afterward
that
it
was
a
proverb
about
the
opinion
of
a
wise
fool
eugenia
was
so
astonished
she
did
not
know
that
joyce
can
speak
french
she
has
a
way
of
using
it
herself
all
the
time
when
she
talks
she
is
always
throwing
in
a
french
word
or
sentence
that
lloyd
and
i
understand
joyce
laughed
about
it
to
me
the
first
day
she
came
and
said
eugenia
is
just
as
apt
to
use
the
wrong
word
as
the
right
one
this
was
the
first
time
that
joyce
had
spoken
french
and
eugenia
was
so
surprised
she
could
help
showing
it
and
asked
her
why
she
had
never
said
anything
before
in
that
language
joyce
told
her
that
her
teacher
never
allowed
her
to
mix
the
languages
she
said
it
was
in
bad
taste
to
do
so
in
speaking
to
people
who
only
understood
one
that
it
seemed
affected
or
as
if
the
person
wanted
to
show
off
how
much
she
knew
then
that
made
eugenia
mad
and
she
asked
her
in
a
spiteful
way
if
it
was
a
public
school
teacher
that
told
her
that
and
said
she
know
that
they
taught
french
out
west
joyce
said
yes
that
they
did
but
that
of
course
a
year
abroad
was
quite
a
help
and
that
before
she
left
france
they
told
her
that
her
accent
was
quite
parisian
that
took
the
wind
out
of
eugenia
sails
she
did
not
know
that
joyce
had
been
abroad
she
is
crazy
to
go
herself
but
that
is
the
one
thing
that
her
father
will
not
humour
her
in
he
says
that
she
must
wait
until
she
is
older
and
he
has
time
to
go
with
her
himself
all
her
friends
have
been
and
it
seemed
to
mortify
her
that
joyce
was
ahead
of
her
there
she
has
put
on
any
airs
with
joyce
since
although
she
still
does
with
me
this
is
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
to
write
in
my
good
times
book
but
i
have
put
it
in
to
explain
why
we
have
paired
off
as
we
have
joyce
and
i
go
together
now
and
eugenia
and
lloyd
eugenia
flatters
her
all
the
time
and
never
says
hateful
things
to
her
as
she
does
to
us
and
lloyd
thinks
that
eugenia
is
perfection
some
letters
came
this
afternoon
a
whole
handful
for
eugenia
written
on
handsome
linen
paper
and
sealed
with
pretty
monogram
seals
i
had
a
letter
too
the
first
one
since
i
have
been
here
it
was
from
davy
and
printed
in
big
tipsy
letters
that
straggled
all
over
the
page
there
were
only
a
few
lines
but
i
knew
how
long
the
little
fellow
must
have
worked
over
them
gripping
the
pencil
tight
in
his
hard
little
fist
i
was
so
proud
of
it
davy
first
letter
that
i
passed
it
around
for
the
girls
to
see
lloyd
and
joyce
were
interested
and
amused
and
laughed
as
i
had
done
over
the
dear
crooked
letters
but
eugenia
was
in
one
of
her
high
and
mighty
moods
and
she
only
lifted
those
black
eyebrows
in
that
indifferent
way
of
hers
and
tossed
it
back
what
awfully
queer
she
said
i
did
know
that
anybody
ever
wrote
on
ruled
paper
nowadays
but
servants
eliot
always
does
but
it
so
common
to
use
it
you
know
i
could
hardly
keep
the
tears
back
to
have
her
make
fun
of
poor
little
davy
letter
for
a
few
minutes
i
was
so
homesick
that
i
wished
i
was
back
with
davy
in
the
plain
old
farmhouse
where
it
does
make
any
difference
whether
there
are
lines
on
your
paper
or
not
or
any
such
silly
things
as
that
everybody
uses
ruled
paper
there
for
that
matter
because
squire
jaynes
does
sell
any
other
kind
what
difference
does
it
make
anyhow
i
should
like
to
know
i
went
off
to
my
own
room
with
the
letter
and
joyce
followed
me
and
found
me
crying
she
made
a
face
out
of
the
window
at
eugenia
and
told
me
never
to
mind
what
anybody
said
there
was
a
big
wide
world
outside
of
eugenia
set
with
its
silly
airs
and
graces
and
sensible
people
made
fun
of
them
then
she
offered
to
illustrate
my
answer
to
letter
and
drew
a
picture
of
calico
and
lad
at
the
top
of
the
page
and
lloyd
parrot
at
the
bottom
that
reminded
me
to
tell
him
some
funny
things
the
parrot
had
said
and
in
writing
them
i
got
over
my
homesickness
eugenia
has
a
crest
on
her
paper
because
some
one
of
her
almost
back
to
noah
was
a
lord
but
it
does
make
her
remember
to
act
like
a
lady
she
ought
to
be
made
to
learn
the
lines
that
were
in
my
once
kind
hearts
are
more
than
coronets
and
simple
faith
than
norman
blood
chapter
viii
the
gypsy
there
had
fallen
a
pause
in
the
round
of
after
a
week
of
picnics
and
lawn
fêtes
and
tennis
tournaments
there
came
a
day
for
which
no
special
entertainment
had
been
planned
it
was
a
hot
morning
and
the
girls
were
out
under
the
trees
betty
in
the
swing
with
a
book
in
her
lap
as
usual
joyce
on
a
near
by
making
a
sketch
of
her
and
eugenia
swinging
idly
in
a
hammock
the
little
colonel
had
been
swinging
with
her
but
something
had
called
her
to
the
house
and
a
deep
silence
fell
on
the
little
group
after
her
departure
betty
lost
in
her
book
and
joyce
intent
on
her
sketch
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
but
presently
eugenia
sat
up
in
the
hammock
and
gave
her
pillow
an
impatient
thump
illustration
glad
that
i
do
have
to
live
in
the
country
the
year
round
whew
how
deadly
stupid
it
is
here
she
exclaimed
i
glad
that
i
do
have
to
live
in
the
country
the
year
round
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
see
i
turn
to
a
vegetable
in
a
little
while
and
strike
root
i
wish
something
exciting
would
happen
for
i
bored
stiff
betty
looked
up
from
her
story
in
astonishment
why
i
think
it
is
lovely
here
she
cried
i
never
get
tired
of
locust
in
a
hundred
years
eugenia
smiled
a
pitying
amused
sort
of
smile
that
brought
a
flush
to
betty
cheek
there
was
a
tinge
of
a
sneer
in
it
that
seemed
to
say
oh
you
poor
thing
of
course
like
it
you
have
never
known
any
better
betty
eyes
went
back
to
her
book
again
eugenia
thrusting
one
little
foot
from
a
mass
of
pink
ruffles
gave
an
impatient
push
against
the
ground
with
the
toe
of
her
slipper
which
set
the
hammock
to
swinging
violently
she
yawned
discontently
i
wish
that
we
could
go
down
to
the
gypsy
camp
that
we
passed
yesterday
so
do
i
agreed
joyce
it
looked
so
picturesque
with
the
tents
and
the
white
covered
wagons
and
that
old
crone
bending
over
the
i
know
a
woman
at
home
who
had
her
fortune
told
by
a
gypsy
and
every
single
thing
that
was
told
her
came
true
i
wonder
how
they
can
tell
said
eugenia
by
the
lines
in
their
hands
it
is
as
plain
as
the
alphabet
to
some
people
they
can
tell
how
long
you
going
to
live
whether
you
be
married
or
not
and
what
sort
of
a
future
you
to
have
they
say
that
there
are
some
lines
in
your
hand
that
mean
wealth
and
some
health
and
there
are
stars
for
success
and
crosses
for
losses
and
all
sorts
of
signs
oh
how
interesting
cried
betty
again
pausing
in
her
story
and
spreading
out
her
little
brown
hands
to
examine
them
eugenia
held
up
one
of
her
slim
palms
and
studied
it
intently
tracing
the
lines
with
a
tapering
white
forefinger
here
a
star
in
my
hand
she
cried
excitedly
and
all
sorts
of
queer
lines
and
marks
that
i
never
noticed
before
i
wonder
which
is
the
marriage
line
oh
girls
i
just
wild
to
have
my
fortune
told
ride
down
to
the
camp
before
lunch
costs
too
much
said
joyce
holding
her
sketch
off
at
arm
length
and
studying
the
effect
through
eyes
rob
moore
said
that
his
brother
edward
went
over
to
the
camp
with
a
party
several
nights
ago
and
they
had
to
pay
a
dollar
apiece
that
bars
me
out
for
dollars
grow
on
bushes
at
my
house
besides
bob
said
his
brother
said
that
they
are
not
real
gypsies
the
people
around
here
think
they
are
a
set
of
strolling
horse
thieves
mister
edward
says
that
the
old
woman
looks
like
a
florida
cracker
and
talks
like
one
too
but
she
vows
that
she
is
the
seventh
daughter
of
a
seventh
daughter
and
was
born
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
that
settles
it
cried
eugenia
i
am
going
she
turned
the
sparkling
rings
on
her
finger
and
watched
them
reflect
the
light
as
she
spoke
we
all
go
it
will
be
my
treat
i
have
touched
my
allowance
since
i
been
here
and
papa
gave
me
ten
dollars
more
than
usual
this
month
there
is
any
place
to
spend
money
here
but
at
the
grocery
and
meat
shop
and
it
burning
a
hole
in
my
purse
only
four
dollars
for
all
of
us
that
is
very
much
only
four
dollars
thought
betty
lifting
startled
eyes
and
thinking
of
the
five
nickels
with
which
she
had
set
forth
on
her
journey
it
seemed
a
fortune
say
that
you
will
go
insisted
eugenia
i
think
you
mean
things
if
you
do
for
it
will
give
me
more
pleasure
to
take
you
than
anything
i
can
possibly
think
of
yes
i
be
glad
to
go
said
joyce
it
is
awfully
sweet
of
you
to
stand
treat
eugenia
i
think
so
too
exclaimed
betty
adding
her
thanks
joyce
rose
gathering
up
her
sketching
materials
are
you
going
to
the
house
asked
eugenia
then
ask
lloyd
if
she
wo
send
word
to
alec
to
saddle
the
ponies
and
tell
her
we
want
her
to
take
a
short
ride
with
us
before
lunch
do
say
where
we
are
going
we
surprise
her
all
right
answered
joyce
moving
off
down
the
path
and
joyce
called
eugenia
after
her
please
tell
eliot
to
brush
my
hat
and
put
some
new
laces
in
my
boots
i
be
there
by
the
time
the
ponies
are
at
the
house
do
you
think
it
will
be
fun
she
added
turning
to
betty
when
they
were
left
alone
in
the
rôle
of
lady
bountiful
she
felt
very
friendly
and
gracious
yes
indeed
cried
betty
i
think
it
will
be
perfectly
lovely
it
is
so
generous
of
you
eugenia
to
spend
so
much
for
our
pleasure
oh
that
nothing
answered
eugenia
loftily
plenty
more
where
that
came
from
on
the
way
to
the
house
joyce
met
sherman
driving
toward
her
in
a
do
you
want
to
drive
down
to
the
with
me
she
asked
there
is
room
for
one
more
joyce
shook
her
head
and
walked
on
singing
gaily
over
her
shoulder
other
fish
to
fry
so
it
ca
be
i
thank
you
kindly
eugenia
elizabeth
do
either
of
you
want
to
go
sherman
asked
stopping
the
beside
the
hammock
no
i
believe
not
thank
you
said
eugenia
languidly
it
so
hot
this
morning
betty
mouth
and
eyes
both
opened
in
astonishment
at
the
excuse
eugenia
gave
and
her
godmother
smiled
at
the
sight
well
elizabeth
she
said
playfully
i
see
that
you
are
not
going
to
leave
me
in
the
lurch
i
knew
that
i
would
have
to
go
begging
far
for
company
oh
i
love
to
go
godmother
cried
betty
if
it
was
only
any
other
time
but
i
just
been
invited
to
ride
over
to
the
gypsy
camp
with
the
girls
to
the
gypsy
camp
echoed
sherman
in
surprise
why
are
you
going
there
to
have
our
fortunes
told
answered
the
unsuspicious
child
adding
gratefully
is
it
good
of
eugenia
she
is
going
to
pay
for
all
of
us
a
smothered
exclamation
broke
from
eugenia
lips
and
she
darted
an
angry
look
at
betty
there
was
a
shadow
of
annoyance
on
face
as
she
saw
it
but
you
must
go
there
she
said
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
disappoint
you
but
i
could
think
for
a
moment
of
allowing
lloyd
to
go
there
they
are
a
rough
low
set
of
people
gamblers
and
horse
thieves
it
would
be
proper
for
you
little
girls
to
go
near
them
i
intended
to
mention
the
matter
to
lloyd
when
i
first
heard
that
they
had
camped
in
the
valley
and
tell
her
to
avoid
taking
you
on
any
of
the
roads
leading
to
the
camp
but
i
forgot
it
until
you
had
ridden
away
it
would
have
worried
me
all
the
time
you
were
out
had
i
not
known
that
lloyd
is
a
discreet
child
for
her
age
and
she
heard
so
much
said
about
them
when
they
were
here
last
summer
i
have
never
thought
to
mention
it
since
that
first
day
i
sorry
said
eugenia
i
had
set
my
heart
on
having
my
fortune
told
sherman
tapped
the
wheel
of
the
with
the
lash
of
her
whip
and
sat
considering
presently
she
said
of
course
there
is
any
truth
in
the
fortunes
they
tell
one
person
knows
just
as
much
about
the
future
as
another
but
i
am
sorry
for
your
disappointment
for
i
know
at
your
age
such
things
are
entertaining
how
would
it
do
for
me
to
call
at
miss
allison
macintyre
while
i
am
out
and
ask
her
to
come
up
to
dinner
she
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
knows
enough
about
palmistry
to
tell
some
very
interesting
fortunes
she
can
amuse
young
people
better
than
any
one
i
ever
knew
her
two
nephews
malcolm
and
keith
macintyre
came
out
from
louisville
for
a
short
visit
yesterday
and
i
invite
them
too
they
are
jolly
boys
and
i
sure
you
will
find
them
far
more
entertaining
than
any
of
the
gypsies
what
do
you
say
to
that
plan
will
it
make
up
for
the
disappointment
yes
indeed
answered
betty
and
eugenia
smiled
her
approval
for
she
had
heard
lloyd
talk
about
the
macintyre
boys
and
had
been
hoping
to
see
them
but
when
sherman
had
driven
on
she
turned
to
betty
with
an
angry
face
tattletale
she
said
in
a
sneering
tone
why
did
you
go
and
spoil
everything
if
you
had
kept
still
we
could
have
gone
and
nobody
would
have
been
the
wiser
now
it
will
be
no
end
of
trouble
to
get
there
without
her
finding
it
out
you
do
mean
that
you
are
going
after
all
that
godmother
has
said
cried
betty
with
a
look
of
horror
in
her
big
brown
eyes
why
a
wild
arab
would
treat
his
host
with
such
disrespect
as
that
after
eaten
his
salt
eugenia
black
eyes
flashed
dangerously
yes
miss
prunes
and
prisms
i
am
going
i
do
care
what
you
say
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
have
my
fortune
told
by
the
seventh
daughter
of
a
seventh
daughter
that
was
born
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
ca
make
me
change
it
again
it
is
foolish
of
cousin
elizabeth
to
be
so
particular
and
i
am
going
to
do
as
i
please
i
always
do
at
home
no
matter
what
papa
says
i
never
had
to
mind
anybody
all
my
life
and
i
certainly
not
begin
it
now
that
i
am
in
my
teens
it
is
all
nonsense
about
it
not
being
proper
for
us
to
go
to
the
camp
cousin
elizabeth
is
mighty
nice
and
sweet
but
she
an
old
fogy
to
talk
that
way
and
she
need
think
she
has
stopped
me
i
may
not
get
there
but
i
go
to
that
camp
before
i
go
back
to
new
york
if
it
the
last
thing
i
do
she
sprang
out
of
the
hammock
and
walked
haughtily
down
the
path
her
head
held
high
and
her
pink
ruffles
switching
angrily
from
side
to
side
betty
followed
at
a
safe
distance
reaching
the
house
in
time
to
see
joyce
and
lloyd
come
down
ready
for
their
ride
she
would
have
made
some
excuse
to
stay
at
home
if
she
thought
that
eugenia
intended
to
carry
out
her
plans
at
once
but
thinking
she
would
surely
not
attempt
it
until
a
later
day
she
mounted
with
the
others
and
started
down
the
avenue
at
the
gate
as
they
turned
into
the
public
road
they
spied
a
noisy
little
cavalcade
racing
down
the
pike
toward
them
rob
moore
led
the
charge
and
two
strangers
were
following
hard
behind
it
the
macintyre
boys
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
then
half
turning
in
her
saddle
to
explain
to
the
girls
it
malcolm
and
keith
you
like
them
they
stayed
out
heah
with
their
grandmothah
one
whole
wintah
and
they
used
to
come
up
to
house
lots
you
remembah
i
told
you
them
they
bought
that
pet
beah
from
a
tramp
and
neahly
frightened
me
to
death
at
their
valentine
pahty
i
went
into
a
dahk
room
where
it
was
tied
up
and
did
know
it
was
theah
till
it
stood
up
on
its
hind
feet
and
came
at
me
i
neahly
lost
my
mind
i
was
so
sca
oh
yes
cried
joyce
i
saw
their
pictures
all
dressed
up
like
little
knights
when
they
were
in
the
tableaux
she
surveyed
them
with
great
interest
as
the
cloud
of
dust
they
were
raising
rapidly
drew
nearer
which
one
was
it
ran
away
with
you
in
a
and
nearly
let
the
locomotive
run
over
you
asked
betty
that
was
keith
the
youngest
one
he
is
on
the
black
hawse
and
which
one
gave
you
the
silver
arrow
asked
eugenia
malcolm
answered
the
little
colonel
putting
up
her
hand
to
feel
the
little
pin
that
fastened
her
sailor
collar
oh
she
got
it
on
now
exclaimed
eugenia
turning
to
laugh
over
her
shoulder
at
the
other
girls
see
how
red
her
face
is
i
believe
he
is
her
it
no
such
a
thing
cried
the
little
colonel
angrily
eugenia
forbes
you
are
the
biggest
goose
i
evah
saw
mothah
says
it
silly
for
children
to
talk
about
havin
we
are
just
good
friends
it
is
silly
insisted
eugenia
i
have
two
sweethearts
who
send
me
flowers
and
candy
and
write
me
notes
and
they
are
just
as
jealous
of
each
other
as
they
can
be
then
i
be
ashamed
to
brag
of
it
cried
the
little
colonel
angry
that
her
mother
opinion
had
been
so
flatly
contradicted
but
there
was
no
time
for
a
quarrel
the
boys
had
come
up
with
them
and
lloyd
had
to
make
the
necessary
introductions
eugenia
thought
she
had
never
seen
two
handsomer
boys
or
any
one
with
more
courtly
manners
and
as
malcolm
rode
along
beside
her
she
wished
that
mollie
and
fay
and
kell
could
see
her
knightly
escort
joyce
and
keith
followed
and
betty
and
rob
brought
up
the
rear
the
little
colonel
led
the
way
at
the
station
she
turned
saying
which
way
do
you
all
want
to
go
have
you
ever
been
down
by
the
gypsy
camp
asked
malcolm
we
boys
passed
that
way
a
little
while
ago
and
they
were
playing
on
banjos
and
dancing
and
having
a
fine
old
time
it
quite
a
sight
oh
yes
let
go
cried
eugenia
i
wild
to
see
it
and
have
my
fortune
told
joyce
and
i
were
talking
about
it
a
little
while
before
we
started
you
want
to
go
do
you
joyce
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
what
that
she
answered
to
the
gypsy
camp
of
course
i
thought
that
that
was
where
we
had
decided
to
go
when
we
started
she
had
been
in
the
house
when
sherman
had
discussed
the
matter
with
eugenia
and
betty
and
was
wholly
unconscious
that
there
was
any
objection
to
their
going
i
afraid
mothah
might
not
want
us
to
go
said
lloyd
maybe
it
would
be
bettah
to
wait
until
anothah
day
and
ask
her
rob
and
betty
had
fallen
a
little
behind
the
others
having
spied
a
bunch
of
clovers
and
rob
had
dismounted
to
pick
them
so
they
did
not
hear
the
discussion
that
followed
lloyd
was
not
willing
to
go
without
her
mother
permission
remembering
what
had
been
said
about
the
camp
the
previous
summer
but
eugenia
had
her
way
as
she
usually
did
her
influence
over
lloyd
was
growing
stronger
every
day
busily
talking
with
rob
as
they
followed
along
betty
did
not
notice
where
they
were
going
until
the
strumming
of
a
banjo
and
loud
singing
drew
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
were
almost
upon
the
gypsy
camp
oh
we
must
go
in
here
she
called
in
alarm
seeing
that
the
other
girls
were
dismounting
and
the
boys
were
hitching
their
ponies
along
the
fence
why
asked
joyce
pausing
in
the
act
of
springing
from
the
saddle
godmother
said
we
must
not
an
hour
ago
she
said
it
was
a
proper
place
for
us
and
that
she
would
think
for
a
moment
of
allowing
lloyd
to
come
when
she
saw
that
we
were
disappointed
she
planned
an
entertainment
for
us
and
we
agreed
to
it
both
of
us
eugenia
and
eugenia
knows
she
did
there
were
some
very
curious
glances
exchanged
in
the
little
group
and
the
boys
drew
to
one
side
leaving
the
girls
to
settle
the
matter
between
them
eugenia
darted
a
glance
at
betty
that
would
have
withered
her
if
it
could
for
goodness
sake
do
make
such
an
everlasting
fuss
about
nothing
she
exclaimed
come
on
it
will
be
all
right
but
eugenia
interrupted
lloyd
if
mothah
said
i
could
go
that
settles
it
she
did
tell
you
did
she
asked
eugenia
no
but
if
she
told
you
it
is
just
the
same
but
she
did
tell
me
persisted
eugenia
grown
desperate
to
carry
out
her
own
wishes
and
not
stopping
at
the
truth
i
tell
you
how
it
was
putting
an
arm
around
lloyd
she
drew
her
aside
it
is
all
imagination
she
protested
in
a
low
tone
i
never
saw
such
a
little
silly
for
making
mountains
out
of
she
is
such
a
that
she
would
look
behind
her
if
a
fly
buzzed
now
you
know
lloyd
that
as
particular
as
i
am
i
would
think
of
going
anywhere
that
was
proper
any
more
than
your
mother
would
i
take
the
responsibility
i
sure
i
am
old
enough
and
it
all
right
for
us
to
go
when
three
big
boys
are
with
us
the
others
could
not
hear
what
passed
between
the
two
eugenia
coaxed
and
wheedled
and
sneered
by
turns
and
finally
lloyd
yielded
and
they
all
started
in
all
but
betty
she
waited
in
the
lane
alone
riding
up
and
down
up
and
down
for
ages
it
seemed
to
her
waiting
for
them
to
come
back
in
reality
it
was
not
quite
an
hour
that
she
kept
her
solitary
vigil
in
the
lane
as
she
rode
back
and
forth
she
could
catch
glimpses
of
eugenia
pink
dress
inside
the
tent
where
they
were
all
gathered
around
the
old
now
and
then
she
heard
voices
and
laughter
and
it
gave
her
such
a
lonely
feeling
that
she
could
scarcely
keep
back
the
tears
she
knew
that
the
others
thought
she
was
fussy
and
overparticular
and
that
helped
to
make
her
thoroughly
uncomfortable
the
fretful
wail
of
a
sick
baby
sounded
at
intervals
from
the
tent
the
had
stopped
on
their
arrival
it
was
nearly
noon
when
the
six
children
came
straggling
out
of
the
tent
i
would
have
missed
it
for
anything
said
eugenia
triumphantly
betty
was
a
goose
not
to
go
was
she
why
betty
she
told
me
my
whole
past
and
even
described
the
three
girls
i
go
with
at
school
i
am
to
have
a
long
life
and
lots
of
money
and
to
be
married
twice
and
she
told
me
to
beware
of
a
fleshy
dark
person
with
black
eyes
who
is
jealous
of
me
and
will
try
to
do
me
harm
what
did
she
tell
you
joyce
asked
betty
eagerly
feeling
that
she
had
missed
the
great
opportunity
of
her
life
for
lifting
the
veil
that
hid
her
future
she
said
that
i
had
been
across
a
big
body
of
water
and
was
going
again
but
the
rest
was
a
lot
of
stuff
that
i
did
believe
and
remember
she
did
give
me
a
dollar
worth
of
fortune
complained
rob
not
by
a
long
shot
he
had
paid
his
own
way
and
now
thought
regretfully
of
the
two
circuses
to
which
the
squandered
dollar
might
have
admitted
him
let
not
tell
anybody
we
been
here
suggested
eugenia
as
they
started
homeward
it
will
make
it
so
much
more
romantic
to
keep
it
a
secret
we
can
wait
and
see
what
comes
true
and
tell
each
other
years
afterward
but
i
always
tell
mothah
everything
cried
the
little
colonel
in
surprise
she
would
enjoy
hearing
the
funny
fortunes
the
old
woman
told
us
and
i
suah
if
she
knew
how
sick
that
poah
baby
is
she
send
it
something
she
is
always
helpin
poah
people
but
i
have
a
special
reason
for
keeping
it
a
secret
urged
eugenia
promise
not
to
say
anything
about
it
for
awhile
anyhow
wait
till
i
am
ready
to
go
home
why
asked
lloyd
with
a
puzzled
expression
she
afraid
for
godmother
to
know
said
betty
unable
to
control
her
tongue
any
longer
and
still
smarting
with
the
recollection
of
some
of
the
things
with
which
eugenia
had
answered
her
refusal
to
go
into
the
camp
with
them
it
is
no
such
a
thing
cried
eugenia
it
was
all
right
for
us
to
go
and
i
a
private
reason
of
my
own
for
not
saying
anything
about
it
for
awhile
it
is
a
very
little
thing
to
ask
and
i
sure
that
as
a
guest
of
lloyd
it
is
a
very
little
thing
for
her
to
do
to
respect
my
wishes
that
much
oh
of
course
if
you
put
it
that
way
said
lloyd
i
not
say
anything
about
it
till
you
tell
me
that
i
can
you
boys
do
mind
promising
either
do
you
asked
eugenia
flashing
a
smile
of
her
black
eyes
at
each
one
in
turn
cross
your
hearts
she
cried
laughing
as
they
gave
their
promise
and
swear
truly
blackly
bluely
lay
me
down
and
cut
me
in
twoly
that
you
wo
tell
joyce
laughingly
followed
the
boys
example
and
eugenia
gave
a
significant
smile
toward
betty
riding
on
alone
in
dignified
silence
then
it
is
all
right
she
exclaimed
loud
enough
for
her
to
hear
that
is
if
miss
does
feel
it
her
duty
to
run
and
tell
betty
was
too
angry
to
make
any
answer
she
rode
on
with
her
cheeks
burning
and
her
head
held
high
sherman
was
sitting
in
the
wide
cool
hall
when
the
little
party
stopped
at
the
steps
the
boys
had
ridden
down
the
avenue
too
and
dismounted
to
speak
to
her
i
have
left
invitations
for
you
all
to
come
to
dinner
she
said
as
malcolm
and
keith
came
up
to
shake
hands
your
aunt
allison
has
consented
to
play
for
us
have
you
ever
had
your
fortune
told
rob
you
are
to
come
too
yes
once
answered
rob
cautiously
catching
a
warning
look
from
eugenia
it
was
very
satisfactory
though
and
i
be
glad
to
try
it
again
such
a
flush
had
spread
over
the
little
colonel
face
that
sherman
noticed
it
i
am
afraid
you
have
ridden
too
far
in
this
noonday
heat
little
daughter
she
said
you
better
go
and
bathe
your
face
the
boys
took
their
leave
and
lloyd
escaped
from
her
mother
watchful
eyes
to
follow
her
advice
when
she
came
down
to
lunch
the
flush
was
gone
from
her
cheeks
but
there
was
an
uncomfortable
pricking
of
her
conscience
that
stayed
with
her
all
that
afternoon
and
deepened
steadily
after
miss
allison
arrival
chapter
ix
her
sacred
promise
the
began
immediately
after
dinner
miss
allison
sat
one
side
of
a
screen
and
one
by
one
the
palms
were
thrust
through
a
narrow
opening
for
her
to
examine
sherman
sat
beside
her
so
neither
of
them
saw
the
amused
glances
the
children
exchanged
behind
the
screen
whenever
her
prophecies
contradicted
what
the
old
gypsy
had
told
them
i
can
judge
of
your
chief
characteristics
by
your
hands
she
said
and
it
is
wonderful
how
much
palmistry
reveals
in
that
way
but
i
shall
have
to
draw
on
my
imagination
for
your
future
fortunes
this
she
did
in
such
a
bright
amusing
way
that
screams
of
laughter
went
up
from
behind
the
screen
and
the
hands
she
held
often
shook
with
merriment
not
having
had
the
experience
of
the
gypsy
tent
betty
awaited
her
turn
with
more
interest
than
the
others
and
thrust
her
little
brown
hand
through
the
opening
half
afraid
she
wondered
what
secrets
it
would
tell
miss
allison
who
in
addition
to
all
the
pleasant
complimentary
things
she
had
told
had
added
some
very
plain
truths
eugenia
hand
she
said
showed
its
owner
to
be
extravagant
and
wilful
malcolm
vain
and
overbearing
keith
disorderly
and
rob
lacking
in
judgment
miss
allison
held
betty
hand
a
moment
not
certain
to
whom
it
belonged
although
she
might
have
guessed
considering
how
brown
and
hardened
by
work
it
was
too
sensitive
and
too
imaginative
by
far
she
said
but
i
like
this
little
hand
it
will
always
be
faithful
in
little
things
as
well
as
big
and
will
keep
its
promises
to
the
utmost
it
is
a
hand
that
can
be
trusted
betty
face
shone
what
miss
allison
had
said
pleased
her
more
than
the
fortune
which
followed
although
it
foretold
a
long
life
full
of
as
many
interesting
happenings
as
if
she
had
aladdin
wonderful
lamp
to
use
as
she
chose
she
looked
at
her
hand
with
a
new
interest
after
she
had
withdrawn
it
from
the
screen
and
keith
found
her
studying
it
again
after
the
was
done
and
the
others
had
gone
into
the
eugenia
sat
at
the
piano
lloyd
twanged
on
the
harp
while
joyce
tuned
her
mandolin
and
malcolm
his
banjo
rob
lolled
in
an
open
window
listening
and
beating
time
with
both
feet
sherman
and
miss
allison
were
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
wide
porch
where
the
moonlight
was
stealing
through
the
vines
and
shimmering
on
the
floor
it
was
on
the
porch
steps
that
keith
found
betty
looking
at
her
hands
again
as
they
lay
spread
out
on
her
lap
and
studying
their
lines
by
moonlight
he
sat
down
beside
her
how
does
your
aunt
allison
know
she
asked
without
looking
up
it
seems
like
some
sort
of
witches
work
to
me
the
way
she
guessed
things
about
the
rest
of
you
and
i
suppose
it
just
as
true
what
she
said
about
me
at
least
the
part
about
being
too
sensitive
and
imaginative
is
true
i
know
cousin
hetty
says
i
go
about
with
my
head
in
the
clouds
half
the
time
i
would
love
to
think
that
the
other
part
is
true
too
she
said
it
in
such
a
sweet
solemn
sort
of
a
way
as
if
she
laid
some
kind
of
a
spell
on
my
hand
that
was
not
to
be
broken
will
keep
its
promises
to
the
utmost
she
said
and
i
feel
that
it
will
have
to
do
it
now
just
because
she
said
so
that
is
aunt
allison
way
answered
keith
nobody
knows
how
much
she
has
helped
malcolm
and
me
by
giving
us
these
and
expecting
us
to
live
up
to
them
he
touched
a
little
badge
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
as
he
spoke
it
was
a
tiny
flower
of
white
enamel
with
a
little
diamond
in
the
centre
like
a
drop
of
dew
what
is
that
for
asked
betty
curiously
i
have
been
wondering
why
you
and
your
brother
both
wear
them
aunt
allison
gave
them
to
us
she
calls
us
her
two
little
knights
and
this
is
the
badge
of
our
knighthood
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
it
began
one
time
when
we
were
out
at
grandmother
all
winter
we
gave
a
benefit
for
a
little
tramp
who
came
very
near
being
burned
to
death
in
a
cabin
on
the
place
we
had
tableaux
you
know
and
malcolm
and
i
were
knights
in
one
of
them
oh
i
know
interrupted
betty
eagerly
i
seen
your
picture
taken
in
that
costume
and
it
is
lovely
and
then
aunt
allison
explained
all
about
king
arthur
and
his
round
table
and
gave
us
the
motto
pure
speak
truth
right
the
wrong
honour
the
king
else
wherefore
born
betty
repeated
it
softly
how
lovely
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
tone
all
the
instruments
were
going
now
in
the
harp
mandolin
piano
and
banjo
and
the
music
floated
out
sweetly
on
the
night
air
to
the
earnest
little
couple
on
the
steps
and
the
music
and
the
moonlight
and
betty
sympathetic
little
face
made
it
easy
for
keith
to
grow
confidential
just
then
and
speak
of
things
that
usually
make
boys
shy
he
told
her
of
his
ambition
to
live
up
to
his
knightly
motto
and
of
some
of
his
boyish
efforts
to
right
the
wrong
in
the
big
world
about
him
and
all
that
he
hoped
to
do
when
he
was
grown
and
was
free
to
use
the
money
his
grandfather
had
left
him
i
wish
i
could
be
a
knight
sighed
betty
to
herself
moved
to
large
ambitions
by
the
boy
words
and
discontented
with
her
own
small
sphere
how
manly
he
looked
in
the
moonlight
his
handsome
face
aglow
with
the
thought
of
his
noble
purposes
it
funny
said
keith
looking
down
at
her
you
the
only
person
that
i
ever
talked
to
about
such
things
but
aunt
allison
you
seem
to
understand
in
the
same
way
that
she
does
i
believe
you
have
made
a
good
knight
yourself
if
you
had
lived
in
those
days
because
that
is
one
of
the
things
they
had
to
vow
to
keep
a
promise
to
the
utmost
betty
smiled
happily
but
made
no
answer
rob
joined
them
just
then
and
they
fell
to
talking
of
childish
things
again
games
and
pets
and
things
they
had
done
and
places
they
had
been
next
morning
in
her
good
times
book
betty
carefully
wrote
every
word
she
could
remember
that
keith
had
said
the
evening
before
about
knights
and
knightly
deeds
it
was
a
that
she
loved
to
think
about
miss
allison
had
invited
them
all
to
a
picnic
at
the
old
mill
on
the
following
day
they
were
to
go
in
the
afternoon
and
come
back
by
moonlight
it
was
not
quite
four
when
sherman
stepped
into
the
carriage
at
the
door
followed
by
eliot
with
an
armful
of
wraps
which
might
be
needed
later
in
the
evening
every
spare
inch
of
the
carriage
was
packed
with
things
for
the
picnic
a
huge
lunch
hamper
stood
on
the
front
seat
beside
the
coachman
and
he
could
scarcely
find
room
for
his
feet
for
the
big
freezer
of
that
took
up
so
much
space
rugs
cushions
and
were
tucked
in
at
every
corner
and
sherman
held
joyce
mandolin
in
her
lap
oh
girls
she
called
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
and
looking
up
at
the
second
story
windows
can
i
trust
one
of
you
to
post
the
letter
that
i
have
left
on
the
hall
table
two
bright
faces
appeared
at
the
same
instant
at
different
windows
and
two
voices
called
in
the
same
breath
one
answering
yes
godmother
and
the
other
yes
cousin
elizabeth
i
would
take
it
myself
said
sherman
if
i
were
going
past
the
but
i
have
to
drive
a
roundabout
way
to
the
ross
place
to
get
some
berries
i
engaged
for
the
picnic
it
is
very
important
that
the
letter
should
go
on
mail
train
and
if
one
of
you
will
drop
it
in
the
box
as
you
go
by
i
be
so
much
obliged
yes
i
do
it
answered
each
girl
again
almost
in
the
same
breath
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
to
them
sherman
told
alec
to
drive
on
the
ponies
already
saddled
and
bridled
were
waiting
in
front
of
the
house
the
girls
were
to
ride
by
the
macintyre
place
and
escort
miss
allison
carriage
to
the
and
had
promised
to
be
there
at
four
but
the
hall
clock
struck
the
hour
before
the
last
dress
was
buttoned
and
the
last
ribbon
tied
do
you
heah
that
cried
the
little
colonel
in
a
panic
of
haste
as
the
musical
chime
sounded
through
the
house
it
will
nevah
do
to
keep
miss
allison
waitin
come
on
she
exclaimed
adding
as
she
flew
through
the
upper
hall
the
last
one
down
the
stairs
is
a
monkey
i
not
it
shrieked
joyce
racing
past
her
i
not
it
echoed
betty
darting
ahead
of
them
both
and
reaching
the
ponies
first
eugenia
last
she
is
the
monkey
cried
joyce
cheerfully
looking
back
with
a
laugh
as
she
began
to
untie
calico
eugenia
switched
her
skirts
disdainfully
through
the
hall
and
mounted
in
dignified
disgust
you
elegant
i
must
say
she
exclaimed
scornfully
i
play
such
a
kid
game
nevertheless
she
dashed
down
the
avenue
at
the
top
of
her
speed
when
joyce
called
out
tantalisingly
the
last
one
through
the
gate
is
a
jibbering
ornithorhynchus
in
her
zeal
not
to
be
dubbed
such
a
title
for
the
rest
of
the
day
as
a
jibbering
ornithorhynchus
betty
urged
lad
along
until
she
nearly
bounced
out
of
her
saddle
and
the
letter
lay
on
the
hall
table
forgotten
by
both
the
girls
who
had
promised
to
post
it
it
was
a
devious
way
to
the
ruins
of
the
old
stone
mill
down
unfrequented
roads
through
meadow
gates
and
over
a
narrow
pasture
lot
then
up
a
little
hill
and
into
a
cool
beech
woods
where
the
peace
of
the
summer
reigned
unbroken
piloted
by
lloyd
they
reached
the
place
just
as
sherman
drove
in
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
woods
the
vacant
windows
of
the
old
mill
seemed
staring
in
surprise
at
the
gay
party
gathering
on
the
hill
above
it
although
it
should
have
been
accustomed
to
all
kinds
of
picnics
by
this
time
considering
the
number
of
generations
it
had
watched
them
come
and
go
nobody
could
tell
how
long
it
had
been
since
the
mill
wheel
turned
its
last
round
and
the
miller
ground
his
last
grist
but
if
the
stones
could
babble
secrets
like
the
little
spring
trickling
down
the
rocky
bank
they
would
have
had
many
an
interesting
tale
to
tell
of
all
that
had
happened
in
their
hearing
there
were
many
names
and
initials
carved
in
the
bark
of
the
old
malcolm
found
his
father
and
mother
on
one
as
he
wandered
around
with
eugenia
and
set
to
work
to
cut
his
own
underneath
eugenia
seated
herself
on
a
rock
near
by
to
watch
him
keith
and
rob
and
the
other
boys
who
had
been
invited
to
the
picnic
busied
themselves
by
dragging
up
sticks
and
logs
for
a
big
bonfire
the
girls
began
a
game
of
i
spy
behind
the
great
rock
where
the
columbines
clambered
in
the
spring
and
spread
their
blossoms
like
butterflies
poised
on
an
airy
stem
come
on
eugenia
they
called
but
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
what
the
girls
called
a
young
ladified
air
and
turned
to
malcolm
with
a
coquettish
glance
of
her
big
black
eyes
i
know
whose
initials
you
are
going
to
cut
with
yours
she
said
whose
asked
malcolm
digging
away
at
a
capital
oh
i
not
tell
but
i
know
well
enough
there
only
one
that
you
cut
you
know
you
need
be
so
sure
about
that
said
malcolm
loftily
i
know
plenty
of
names
that
i
would
mind
cutting
here
in
this
tree
with
mine
with
a
heart
around
them
like
the
ones
on
this
tree
she
asked
pointing
to
a
rude
carving
on
the
trunk
against
which
she
leaned
yes
with
a
heart
around
them
he
repeated
but
there
only
one
name
you
would
carve
that
way
and
put
an
through
it
she
said
meaningly
at
any
rate
a
silver
arrow
oh
maybe
you
think
i
have
seen
her
wear
it
and
blush
when
i
teased
her
about
it
malcolm
went
on
cutting
without
an
answer
he
had
admired
eugenia
more
than
any
girl
he
had
ever
seen
but
somehow
this
speech
jarred
on
him
it
did
not
seem
exactly
ladylike
for
her
to
insist
on
twitting
him
in
such
a
personal
way
about
his
friendship
for
the
little
colonel
would
never
have
done
such
a
thing
he
felt
quite
sure
for
a
moment
he
half
wished
that
it
was
lloyd
sitting
on
the
rock
beside
him
but
eugenia
could
be
very
entertaining
when
she
chose
and
she
was
trying
her
best
now
to
make
an
agreeable
impression
on
this
handsome
boy
who
seemed
so
fond
of
lloyd
she
wanted
to
be
first
in
his
attentions
and
as
usual
she
had
her
way
i
told
you
so
she
cried
presently
as
a
large
capital
l
appeared
under
malcolm
initials
i
knew
you
just
could
help
making
an
l
and
the
next
one
will
be
an
i
not
done
yet
he
said
with
a
smiling
at
her
and
added
two
more
lines
changing
the
l
to
an
an
expression
of
pleasure
flashed
across
her
face
as
he
outlined
an
f
next
to
it
it
would
be
something
to
tell
mollie
and
fay
and
kell
next
time
she
wrote
that
the
handsomest
boy
in
kentucky
as
she
enthusiastically
described
him
to
them
with
the
manners
of
a
sir
philip
sidney
had
left
the
record
of
his
attachment
for
her
where
all
might
read
she
gave
him
another
smile
from
under
her
long
black
eyelashes
and
then
looked
down
with
a
blush
he
added
the
heart
to
the
inscription
then
and
pierced
it
with
an
arrow
while
these
two
played
at
a
game
that
older
children
had
played
before
them
for
many
a
generation
as
the
scarred
old
bore
silent
witness
on
every
hand
the
game
of
i
spy
went
on
uproariously
behind
the
columbine
rock
the
bonfire
blazed
higher
and
higher
it
lighted
the
cool
depths
of
the
darkening
woods
and
sent
dancing
shadows
across
the
deep
ravines
and
presently
the
picnic
feast
was
spread
near
by
and
part
of
the
supper
was
cooked
over
its
coals
it
was
by
its
weird
light
that
the
charades
were
played
when
the
feast
had
been
cleared
away
miss
allison
arranged
them
the
actors
were
all
little
negroes
the
funniest
blackest
little
pickaninnies
that
ever
sung
a
song
or
danced
a
double
shuffle
it
sylvia
gibbs
family
explained
miss
allison
to
the
girls
our
circle
of
king
daughters
had
them
under
its
wing
all
winter
or
they
would
have
starved
when
i
discovered
what
heathen
they
were
i
turned
missionary
and
taught
them
an
hour
every
sunday
afternoon
they
will
do
anything
for
me
now
and
are
such
clever
little
mimics
that
i
know
they
can
act
the
charades
charmingly
besides
they
will
give
us
a
afterward
and
sing
for
us
like
nightingales
while
miss
allison
marshalled
her
flock
of
little
darkies
behind
the
great
rock
sherman
called
the
children
to
seat
themselves
in
a
semicircle
on
the
and
rugs
in
front
this
is
to
be
a
guessing
contest
she
explained
as
she
passed
a
card
and
pencil
to
each
guest
there
must
be
no
talking
and
no
comparing
notes
as
each
syllable
is
acted
write
down
the
word
you
think
is
meant
the
one
who
guesses
the
most
charades
wins
the
prize
stir
the
bonfire
alec
now
all
ready
miss
allison
came
out
in
front
of
her
audience
this
word
is
the
name
of
a
favourite
book
she
announced
it
consists
of
two
words
the
first
word
is
in
three
syllables
the
second
in
two
they
will
be
given
in
five
separate
acts
every
eye
watched
intently
as
three
little
coloured
boys
came
out
from
behind
the
rock
and
went
through
the
scene
of
a
highway
robbery
little
jim
gibbs
his
white
teeth
and
gleaming
eyeballs
making
his
face
seem
as
black
as
night
by
contrast
strode
out
with
a
high
silk
hat
a
baggy
umbrella
and
an
old
he
was
evidently
intended
to
represent
a
lonely
traveller
for
as
he
sauntered
along
in
front
of
the
audience
two
other
boys
of
the
gibbs
family
sprang
out
of
the
bushes
in
the
background
with
white
cloth
masks
over
their
faces
one
carried
a
dark
lantern
and
the
other
a
toy
pistol
which
he
held
at
jim
head
they
proceeded
to
go
through
the
traveller
pockets
stealing
watch
purse
and
umbrella
after
that
they
took
to
their
heels
leaving
the
poor
despoiled
traveller
looking
mournfully
at
his
empty
pockets
which
were
turned
wrong
side
out
steal
wrote
eugenia
on
her
card
although
she
could
think
of
no
book
beginning
with
that
name
thieves
wrote
rob
and
any
one
looking
over
the
shoulders
of
the
group
would
have
seen
several
cards
which
bore
the
same
word
but
more
which
their
puzzled
owners
had
left
blank
betty
tapped
her
teeth
a
moment
with
a
pencil
and
then
triumphantly
wrote
rob
the
next
act
showed
a
hastily
constructed
house
made
of
a
and
heavy
roofing
paper
doors
and
windows
had
been
roughly
outlined
in
charcoal
in
front
a
swinging
announced
it
as
the
traveller
rest
and
offered
refreshment
within
for
man
and
beast
inn
wrote
betty
quickly
guessing
the
second
syllable
she
was
sure
of
the
whole
word
now
but
the
majority
of
the
children
sat
with
their
pencils
in
their
mouths
unable
to
think
of
any
word
that
would
fit
in
place
beside
the
one
already
written
oh
this
is
easy
said
betty
to
herself
writing
the
name
robinson
crusoe
after
the
last
act
as
the
of
little
pickaninnies
seated
in
an
old
skiff
which
had
been
dragged
up
from
the
mill
stream
for
that
purpose
took
up
a
piece
of
and
began
to
betty
was
the
only
one
who
had
guessed
it
the
next
charade
was
easier
every
one
wrote
music
on
his
card
after
the
two
acts
in
which
plaintive
floated
up
from
the
rocks
and
the
gibbs
family
were
taken
all
but
jim
who
in
the
high
silk
hat
he
had
worn
before
took
the
part
of
doctor
if
they
are
all
as
easy
as
this
thought
betty
i
can
surely
take
one
of
the
prizes
and
she
waited
eagerly
for
the
next
word
in
the
first
act
gibbs
came
out
with
an
envelope
in
her
hands
and
all
of
a
sudden
betty
heart
gave
a
guilty
thump
as
she
thought
of
the
letter
she
and
eugenia
had
left
lying
on
the
hall
table
they
had
forgotten
their
promise
but
it
is
eugenia
fault
every
bit
as
much
as
it
is
mine
she
thought
looking
across
the
semicircle
where
eugenia
sat
serenely
unconscious
of
forgotten
promises
she
just
as
much
to
blame
as
i
am
oh
well
i
mail
it
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
her
conscience
kept
troubling
her
your
godmother
asked
if
she
could
trust
you
and
she
said
it
was
important
you
know
you
promised
there
time
yet
to
slip
away
and
post
that
letter
before
the
mail
train
goes
by
but
betty
would
not
listen
to
her
conscience
she
resolutely
turned
her
attention
to
the
charades
until
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
hear
miss
allison
voice
saying
i
like
this
little
hand
it
will
keep
a
promise
to
the
utmost
then
keith
conversation
of
the
night
before
came
back
to
her
about
his
motto
and
his
badge
but
more
than
all
the
thought
of
being
worthy
of
her
godmother
trust
in
her
impelled
her
to
keep
her
promise
it
was
a
hard
struggle
that
went
on
in
the
little
girl
mind
just
then
from
the
puzzled
glances
around
her
she
was
sure
that
she
was
the
only
one
who
had
guessed
all
the
charades
correctly
therefore
she
stood
the
best
chance
of
winning
the
first
prize
and
she
wanted
it
oh
how
she
wanted
it
for
sherman
had
said
that
it
was
a
book
and
yet
her
sacred
promise
if
she
kept
it
she
would
lose
her
only
chance
it
was
twilight
in
the
woods
and
it
would
be
dark
before
she
could
get
back
to
the
it
would
be
right
to
ask
any
one
else
to
go
with
her
and
miss
the
chance
of
winning
the
prize
too
still
there
was
that
promise
and
it
must
be
kept
to
the
utmost
all
these
thoughts
went
on
swaying
her
first
to
one
decision
and
then
another
she
half
rose
from
the
rug
where
she
was
sitting
then
dropped
down
again
it
seemed
hardly
fair
that
eugenia
should
not
share
the
responsibility
yet
she
knew
her
too
well
to
ask
her
to
go
back
to
the
house
with
her
several
times
she
started
up
and
then
sank
back
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
finally
she
walked
over
to
a
fence
corner
on
the
other
side
of
the
bonfire
where
the
stood
the
ponies
were
hitched
below
in
the
ravine
so
intently
was
the
group
above
watching
the
charades
that
no
one
saw
her
when
she
scrambled
down
the
steep
path
leading
into
the
ravine
and
began
untying
lad
climbing
into
the
saddle
she
gave
one
regretful
look
at
the
party
she
was
leaving
behind
her
and
resolutely
turned
his
head
toward
home
it
was
lighter
out
in
the
open
when
they
had
left
the
shelter
of
the
woods
and
she
guided
the
pony
down
the
hill
across
the
pasture
and
through
the
gate
glad
that
she
did
not
have
to
go
all
the
way
in
darkness
lad
knowing
that
he
was
going
home
dashed
down
the
road
choosing
his
own
direction
when
the
lonely
highway
branched
he
knew
the
way
better
than
his
little
rider
she
looked
around
her
thinking
how
long
the
way
seemed
when
she
had
to
travel
it
all
by
herself
she
was
riding
faster
than
she
had
ever
ridden
before
and
yet
it
seemed
hours
since
she
had
left
the
mill
when
she
at
last
reached
the
great
gate
with
the
avenue
of
locusts
stretching
beyond
it
springing
off
the
pony
when
it
stopped
at
the
steps
she
rushed
into
the
hall
snatched
the
letter
from
the
table
and
ran
out
again
only
pausing
for
a
hasty
glance
at
the
clock
mom
beck
who
had
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
the
quick
step
on
the
porch
and
the
wild
dash
out
again
feared
that
something
was
amiss
and
came
running
to
the
door
what
undah
the
sun
is
the
mattah
honey
she
called
but
betty
was
far
down
the
avenue
and
never
paused
to
look
back
lad
turned
away
from
home
was
not
so
willing
to
run
now
and
betty
could
hear
the
train
whistling
up
the
road
it
was
the
seven
mail
train
oh
lad
hurry
she
urged
dear
good
old
lad
hurry
i
so
afraid
we
wo
get
there
in
time
lad
looked
around
at
her
and
stopped
still
in
the
road
the
train
whistled
nearer
guiding
the
pony
to
the
fence
betty
stood
up
and
broke
a
switch
from
an
overhanging
tree
i
hate
to
do
it
you
poor
old
fellow
she
said
but
i
must
you
get
to
the
in
time
urged
along
by
the
switch
and
her
tearful
pleadings
lad
broke
into
a
run
and
brought
up
at
the
just
as
the
postmistress
was
locking
the
oh
miss
mattie
sounded
an
anxious
little
voice
at
the
delivery
window
is
it
too
late
to
send
this
letter
sherman
said
it
must
go
if
possible
on
this
train
it
a
close
shave
my
dear
said
miss
mattie
reaching
out
to
take
the
letter
eagerly
thrust
through
the
bars
i
a
few
minutes
late
anyhow
and
there
barely
time
to
stamp
it
and
slip
it
in
so
she
acted
while
she
spoke
so
that
with
the
last
word
she
had
turned
the
key
a
coloured
porter
who
stood
waiting
caught
up
the
bag
and
hurried
across
the
road
to
the
railroad
station
the
train
came
thundering
down
the
track
and
he
jumped
across
in
front
of
the
locomotive
betty
watched
until
she
saw
the
tossed
aboard
and
then
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
thankfulness
well
she
exclaimed
to
lad
in
a
relieved
tone
that
done
we
too
late
for
the
charades
but
maybe
we
get
back
to
the
mill
in
time
for
the
it
would
have
been
quite
dark
by
the
time
she
reached
the
again
if
it
had
not
been
that
the
moon
was
beginning
to
rise
and
cast
a
faint
whiteness
over
the
dusky
fields
she
could
not
remember
which
way
to
turn
the
first
time
she
passed
that
way
she
had
paid
no
attention
to
direction
but
had
followed
heedlessly
after
lloyd
the
second
time
the
pony
had
shot
by
so
fast
that
she
had
had
no
time
to
consider
now
he
stood
still
not
caring
which
way
she
chose
so
long
as
he
had
to
travel
away
from
his
stall
and
it
must
be
to
the
left
she
said
in
bewilderment
after
a
hesitation
and
slowly
turned
in
that
direction
but
she
had
taken
the
wrong
way
she
went
on
and
on
wondering
why
she
did
not
come
to
a
gate
when
the
road
suddenly
turned
into
a
narrow
wagon
track
with
dark
on
each
side
there
was
not
a
house
or
a
human
being
in
sight
the
moon
was
not
high
enough
yet
to
dispel
much
of
the
gloom
of
the
twilight
and
bullbats
were
circling
overhead
dipping
so
low
at
times
that
once
they
almost
brushed
her
face
oh
i
lost
she
whispered
with
trembling
lips
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
rustling
of
the
high
corn
and
out
of
it
limped
a
big
burly
negro
he
had
a
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
a
dog
skulked
at
his
heels
betty
nearly
screamed
in
her
terror
at
this
sudden
appearance
she
knew
at
a
glance
that
the
fellow
must
be
limping
tige
one
of
the
worst
characters
in
the
county
he
had
just
served
a
third
term
in
the
penitentiary
and
she
had
heard
mom
beck
say
that
nobody
in
the
valley
would
draw
an
easy
breath
while
limping
tige
was
loose
a
cold
fear
seized
the
child
and
such
a
weakness
numbed
her
trembling
hands
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
the
bridle
wheeling
the
pony
so
suddenly
that
she
almost
lost
her
balance
she
gave
him
a
cut
with
the
switch
that
sent
him
flying
back
over
the
road
he
had
come
at
the
top
of
his
speed
now
every
bush
and
every
tree
and
every
fence
corner
seemed
to
hold
some
nameless
terror
for
her
and
even
her
lips
were
cold
and
blue
with
fear
at
the
she
had
another
fright
as
something
big
and
black
loomed
up
in
the
moonlight
ahead
of
her
oh
what
is
it
she
moaned
so
frightened
that
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
the
next
glance
showed
her
that
it
was
some
one
coming
toward
her
on
horseback
and
then
a
cheery
whistling
reassured
her
nobody
could
be
very
dangerous
she
knew
who
could
go
along
the
road
whistling
my
old
kentucky
home
in
such
a
happy
fashion
it
was
keith
who
had
come
to
hunt
for
her
they
had
missed
her
when
the
charades
were
over
and
finding
her
pony
gone
too
thought
that
she
must
have
been
taken
suddenly
ill
and
had
slipped
away
quietly
in
order
not
to
disturb
the
pleasure
of
the
others
keith
had
offered
to
ride
up
to
locust
and
see
what
was
the
matter
and
his
surprise
showed
itself
in
his
rapid
questioning
when
he
met
her
riding
wildly
away
from
the
place
where
she
had
seen
limping
tige
it
did
not
take
long
for
him
to
learn
the
whole
story
of
her
lonely
ride
and
the
fright
she
had
had
for
his
questions
were
fired
with
such
directness
of
aim
that
truthful
betty
could
not
dodge
them
and
you
missed
it
all
the
charades
and
the
chance
of
taking
the
prize
and
came
all
the
way
back
by
yourself
just
to
post
a
letter
when
you
did
know
the
way
he
exclaimed
again
as
they
drew
in
sight
of
the
old
mill
well
i
call
that
pretty
plucky
for
a
girl
i
did
want
to
confessed
betty
but
there
was
anything
else
to
do
it
was
a
sacred
promise
you
know
and
i
had
to
keep
it
to
the
utmost
they
jogged
along
in
silence
side
by
side
a
moment
longer
then
as
the
bonfire
at
the
old
mill
flared
into
sight
keith
looked
down
at
the
tired
little
figure
on
the
pony
beside
him
betty
he
said
with
a
gleam
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
you
a
chapter
x
found
out
what
makes
everybody
so
snarly
this
morning
asked
joyce
looking
around
on
the
circle
of
moody
faces
the
four
girls
had
been
lounging
in
hammocks
and
chairs
under
the
trees
for
several
hours
and
in
all
that
time
scarcely
a
civil
word
had
been
spoken
there
is
any
reason
why
we
should
be
cross
joyce
went
on
it
a
glorious
day
we
had
a
delicious
breakfast
and
a
good
ride
and
there
is
the
party
at
sally
fairfax
to
look
forward
to
but
in
spite
of
it
all
i
feel
so
mean
and
cross
that
i
want
to
scratch
somebody
betty
looked
up
from
her
book
and
laughed
i
do
feel
snarly
but
i
been
wondering
ever
since
breakfast
what
had
happened
to
make
you
all
out
of
sorts
lloyd
looks
as
if
she
had
been
eating
sour
pickles
and
eugenia
has
snapped
at
everybody
who
has
spoken
to
her
this
morning
that
a
story
exclaimed
eugenia
tartly
with
such
a
frown
that
lloyd
began
singing
in
a
tantalising
tone
crosspatch
draw
the
latch
sit
by
the
fire
and
spin
oh
hush
up
exclaimed
eugenia
crossly
why
lloyd
said
sherman
coming
up
just
then
in
time
to
hear
lloyd
song
and
eugenia
answer
you
are
surely
not
teasing
one
of
your
guests
i
am
surprised
to
every
one
astonishment
lloyd
flopped
over
in
the
hammock
and
covering
her
face
with
her
arm
began
to
cry
what
is
the
matter
little
daughter
asked
sherman
in
alarm
sitting
down
in
the
hammock
beside
her
and
stroking
the
short
soft
hair
soothingly
she
had
never
known
lloyd
to
be
so
sensitive
to
a
slight
reproof
mother
did
mean
to
scold
her
little
girl
i
was
only
surprised
to
hear
you
saying
anything
unpleasant
to
a
guest
of
yours
have
said
it
too
sobbed
the
little
colonel
if
had
been
so
mean
to
you
all
mawnin
she
been
so
hateful
and
cross
i
have
cried
eugenia
you
began
it
and
you
have
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
ever
since
we
came
out
here
and
joyce
has
kept
nagging
at
me
too
you
both
made
me
feel
so
miserable
and
unhappy
that
i
wish
never
set
eyes
on
you
and
your
horrid
old
kentucky
here
to
sherman
still
greater
surprise
eugenia
fumbled
for
her
handkerchief
and
began
mopping
up
the
tears
that
were
streaming
down
her
face
really
girls
i
am
distressed
exclaimed
sherman
is
there
anything
serious
the
matter
that
you
have
been
quarrelling
about
or
are
you
only
ill
and
nervous
i
nevah
was
so
mizzible
in
all
my
life
said
lloyd
my
throat
is
soah
and
my
eyes
ache
and
i
ca
help
cryin
if
anybody
looks
at
me
that
just
the
way
i
feel
said
eugenia
still
dabbing
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
my
head
aches
besides
i
think
we
are
all
three
taking
bad
colds
said
joyce
from
her
hammock
i
have
reached
the
crying
stage
yet
but
i
fast
on
the
way
toward
it
betty
will
be
the
only
one
able
to
go
to
the
party
and
our
dresses
are
pretty
sherman
looked
from
one
flushed
face
to
another
with
a
puzzled
expression
i
do
know
what
to
think
she
said
but
if
i
were
not
sure
that
you
have
been
no
place
where
you
possibly
could
have
been
exposed
i
should
be
afraid
that
you
are
all
taking
the
measles
doctor
fuller
told
me
the
other
day
that
there
are
several
children
in
the
gypsy
camp
down
with
it
and
one
poor
little
baby
had
died
it
have
proper
attention
why
what
is
the
matter
girls
sherman
paused
having
seen
a
startled
glance
pass
from
lloyd
to
eugenia
surely
you
have
been
near
any
of
those
people
have
you
passed
them
on
the
road
or
met
them
at
the
station
at
any
time
there
was
a
long
pause
in
which
nobody
answered
and
in
which
betty
could
hear
her
heart
beat
fast
lloyd
answer
me
insisted
sherman
wo
me
sobbed
the
little
colonel
she
made
us
all
not
to
tell
eugenia
face
turned
pale
but
she
lifted
her
head
defiantly
as
sherman
turned
to
her
calling
her
name
what
is
the
trouble
child
you
surely
did
go
to
the
camp
that
morning
when
i
warned
you
not
to
yes
we
did
answered
eugenia
a
little
frightened
now
by
the
expression
of
sherman
face
but
still
defiant
when
was
it
about
a
week
ago
i
think
i
do
remember
exactly
it
been
nine
days
said
betty
counting
her
fingers
i
remember
it
because
it
was
the
day
before
the
picnic
at
the
old
mill
and
there
was
a
sick
baby
in
the
tent
when
we
went
in
to
have
our
fortunes
told
added
joyce
it
lay
in
the
old
woman
lap
all
the
time
she
held
my
hand
and
it
kept
turning
its
head
from
side
to
side
and
fretting
in
a
weak
little
voice
as
if
it
did
have
strength
to
cry
hard
that
must
have
been
the
poor
little
thing
that
died
and
you
all
went
into
that
tent
and
all
let
that
old
woman
hold
your
hands
asked
sherman
looking
around
from
one
to
another
with
a
distressed
face
no
mothah
cried
the
little
colonel
betty
did
go
and
she
tried
to
keep
us
from
goin
she
said
you
would
like
it
a
loving
smile
of
unspoken
approval
that
made
betty
heart
glow
with
pleasure
lighted
sherman
face
for
an
instant
then
she
turned
to
the
others
well
i
send
for
doctor
fuller
immediately
if
it
proves
to
be
the
measles
we
will
turn
the
house
into
a
hospital
at
once
if
the
old
saying
is
true
that
misery
loves
company
then
you
ought
to
be
a
contented
quartette
oh
i
already
had
the
measles
said
betty
quickly
two
years
ago
then
i
glad
that
you
will
not
have
to
suffer
for
the
disobedience
of
the
others
answered
her
godmother
it
has
brought
its
own
punishment
this
time
so
i
not
add
a
scolding
i
leave
the
measles
if
what
it
turns
out
to
be
to
preach
you
a
sermon
on
the
text
sure
your
sin
will
find
you
out
sally
fairfax
welcomed
no
guests
from
locust
that
night
at
her
party
for
the
doctor
made
his
visit
and
pronounced
his
verdict
no
parties
for
many
a
long
day
lloyd
and
eugenia
and
joyce
had
the
measles
and
nobody
would
want
betty
to
come
for
fear
of
the
contagion
sherman
and
eliot
and
mom
beck
went
from
one
darkened
room
to
another
with
hot
lemonade
and
betty
was
left
to
roam
about
the
place
by
herself
once
she
slipped
into
the
where
the
costumes
were
laid
out
in
readiness
beside
the
dainty
little
hats
joyce
was
patterned
after
a
pale
blue
and
eugenia
a
scarlet
poppy
lloyd
looked
like
a
pink
hyacinth
and
betty
a
daffodil
it
too
bad
mourned
betty
tilting
the
graceful
daffodil
blossom
of
a
hat
on
her
brown
curls
and
admiring
it
in
the
mirror
got
the
measles
and
this
is
so
sweet
it
a
pity
not
to
wear
it
somewhere
late
that
evening
she
heard
the
little
colonel
grumbling
well
this
is
a
house
pahty
suah
enough
i
must
say
heah
we
are
in
the
house
and
heah
we
stay
and
miss
all
the
fun
i
do
like
this
kind
of
a
house
pahty
nevah
mine
honey
said
mom
beck
it
not
be
as
bad
as
you
think
the
measles
is
done
broke
out
on
you
beautiful
as
thick
as
hops
but
i
hate
this
dahk
room
wailed
the
little
colonel
and
it
so
poky
and
tiahsome
and
i
am
so
hot
and
i
ache
all
ovah
then
betty
heard
sherman
go
into
the
room
and
the
fretting
ceased
as
her
cool
hand
stroked
the
hot
little
forehead
and
her
voice
began
a
slumber
song
it
was
the
white
seal
lullaby
hush
thee
my
baby
the
night
is
behind
us
and
black
are
the
waters
that
sparkled
so
green
how
often
she
had
read
it
in
her
jungle
book
but
she
had
no
idea
how
beautiful
it
was
until
she
heard
it
as
her
godmother
was
singing
it
there
was
the
slow
restful
swinging
motion
of
the
waves
in
that
music
the
coolness
of
the
deep
green
seas
how
quickly
it
took
away
the
fever
and
the
aching
and
left
the
healing
of
sleep
in
its
wake
billow
meets
billow
there
soft
be
thy
pillow
oh
weary
wee
flipperling
curl
at
thy
ease
the
storm
shall
not
wake
thee
nor
shark
overtake
thee
asleep
in
the
arms
of
the
slow
swinging
seas
betty
in
her
room
across
the
hall
leaned
her
head
against
the
and
looked
out
into
the
darkness
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
oh
she
whispered
with
a
quivering
lip
if
i
only
had
a
mother
to
sing
to
me
like
that
i
would
mind
having
the
measles
or
anything
else
the
worst
was
over
in
a
few
days
and
then
two
cots
were
carried
into
eugenia
room
for
lloyd
and
joyce
to
occupy
during
the
day
the
windows
still
had
to
be
kept
darkened
but
the
girls
managed
to
find
a
great
deal
to
amuse
themselves
with
they
would
not
have
fared
so
well
had
it
not
been
for
betty
many
an
hour
she
spent
in
the
dim
room
when
the
summer
was
calling
to
her
on
every
breeze
to
come
out
in
its
sunshine
and
be
glad
in
its
cheer
many
a
game
of
checkers
she
played
with
the
exacting
invalids
when
she
longed
to
be
riding
over
the
country
on
lad
and
she
read
aloud
by
the
single
ray
of
light
admitted
through
the
shutters
and
told
stories
until
her
voice
was
husky
it
fun
is
it
said
eugenia
one
day
when
they
were
waiting
for
their
lunch
to
be
brought
up
i
am
always
wondering
what
is
coming
next
for
cousin
elizabeth
has
never
missed
a
day
sending
up
some
surprise
with
our
meals
it
is
a
continual
we
be
dreadfully
spoiled
said
joyce
like
a
little
boy
at
home
that
i
know
he
insists
on
keeping
christmas
the
year
around
as
he
is
the
only
child
and
they
give
him
the
moon
if
they
could
reach
it
they
let
him
hang
up
his
stocking
every
night
and
every
morning
there
is
a
present
in
it
for
him
cousin
elizabeth
is
spoiling
us
just
the
same
way
said
eugenia
those
little
souvenir
spoons
she
sent
up
with
the
chocolate
yesterday
are
perfect
darlings
i
think
the
world
of
mine
i
wonder
what
the
surprise
will
be
said
lloyd
as
the
jingling
of
silver
and
tinkling
of
ice
in
glasses
sounded
on
the
stairs
i
know
said
betty
running
to
open
the
door
for
the
procession
of
tray
bearers
it
is
conundrum
salad
i
helped
godmother
make
it
eliot
mom
beck
and
the
housemaid
entered
in
solemn
file
each
bearing
a
tray
containing
a
simple
lunch
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
fancy
plate
containing
a
pile
of
crisp
green
lettuce
is
that
a
dainty
dish
to
set
before
the
king
exclaimed
joyce
examining
her
conundrum
salad
oh
girls
how
that
did
fool
me
i
could
have
sworn
that
those
were
real
lettuce
leaves
and
they
are
only
paper
but
what
a
clever
imitation
and
what
a
lot
of
conundrums
written
inside
see
if
you
can
guess
this
one
cried
eugenia
is
it
funny
and
she
read
a
clever
one
that
set
them
all
to
thinking
there
was
much
laughter
when
they
finally
had
to
give
it
up
and
she
told
them
the
answer
now
listen
to
this
said
lloyd
next
and
then
it
was
joyce
turn
and
the
lunch
was
eaten
in
the
midst
of
much
laughing
and
many
bright
remarks
that
the
salad
called
forth
you
would
think
that
having
measles
was
so
funny
said
betty
when
the
trays
had
been
carried
out
if
you
had
had
it
the
way
i
did
it
was
in
the
middle
of
harvest
so
nobody
had
time
to
take
care
of
me
cousin
hetty
had
so
much
to
do
that
she
could
come
many
times
a
day
to
wait
on
me
she
just
look
in
the
door
and
ask
if
i
wanted
anything
and
hurry
away
again
my
little
room
in
the
west
gable
was
hot
the
sun
beat
against
it
all
afternoon
and
the
water
in
the
pitcher
would
stay
cool
sometimes
i
cry
till
my
throat
ached
wishing
that
i
had
a
mother
to
sit
beside
me
and
put
her
cool
hands
against
my
face
and
rub
my
back
when
it
ached
and
sing
me
to
sleep
and
after
i
got
better
and
my
appetite
began
to
come
back
i
lie
and
watch
the
door
for
hours
it
seemed
to
me
waiting
for
cousin
hetty
to
come
up
with
my
meals
i
think
of
all
sorts
of
dainty
things
that
i
had
read
about
until
my
mouth
watered
then
when
she
came
maybe
there
would
be
nothing
but
a
cup
of
tea
slopped
all
over
the
saucer
and
a
piece
of
burnt
toast
or
maybe
it
would
be
a
bowl
of
soup
half
cold
or
too
salty
poor
cousin
hetty
was
so
busy
she
could
bother
to
fix
things
for
me
i
could
help
crying
when
she
gone
be
so
disappointed
but
the
worst
thing
of
all
was
what
davy
did
one
day
he
wanted
to
be
kind
and
nice
and
do
something
for
me
so
he
went
off
to
the
pond
and
sat
there
on
the
hot
sunny
bank
all
morning
trying
to
catch
me
a
fish
to
everybody
surprise
he
did
catch
one
about
eleven
a
little
catfish
and
came
running
straight
up
to
my
room
with
it
in
his
dirty
little
hands
he
smelled
so
fishy
i
could
scarcely
stand
it
for
it
was
the
day
i
felt
the
very
worst
but
he
did
know
that
he
climbed
up
on
the
bed
with
it
and
held
it
almost
under
my
nose
for
me
to
see
he
was
so
happy
that
his
dirty
little
face
was
all
one
big
smile
he
kept
saying
as
he
dangled
it
around
he
pretty
betty
i
ketched
him
i
ketched
him
for
you
you
sick
ugh
i
can
smell
that
fish
yet
i
smelled
it
all
afternoon
for
he
took
it
to
have
it
cleaned
and
cooked
about
one
he
came
back
after
i
had
had
my
lunch
and
there
he
had
it
on
a
plate
fried
up
into
a
crisp
i
could
have
swallowed
any
of
it
to
save
me
but
i
could
disappoint
the
little
fellow
when
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
please
me
so
i
had
to
ask
him
to
leave
it
and
told
him
maybe
i
would
feel
more
like
eating
after
i
had
slept
awhile
so
he
went
out
perfectly
satisfied
and
i
lay
there
growing
sicker
every
minute
from
the
smell
of
that
fried
fish
at
last
i
gathered
up
strength
enough
to
throw
it
out
of
the
window
to
the
cat
but
the
plate
still
smelled
of
it
and
nobody
came
in
to
take
it
away
until
after
dark
cousin
hetty
was
dreadfully
worried
when
she
found
that
davy
had
been
in
my
room
but
he
did
take
the
measles
and
that
was
the
only
time
i
saw
him
while
i
was
sick
i
was
alone
all
the
time
you
ca
imagine
how
doleful
it
was
to
stay
in
that
hot
dark
room
all
day
by
myself
you
poor
little
bettykins
sighed
joyce
sympathetically
it
too
bad
you
ca
have
the
measles
all
over
again
with
us
here
at
the
house
party
it
really
is
a
bit
bad
now
i
am
enjoying
it
immensely
as
she
spoke
there
was
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
in
the
avenue
and
a
moment
later
a
shrill
whistle
sounded
under
the
window
hello
measles
shouted
a
merry
voice
it
rob
exclaimed
lloyd
hello
yourself
she
called
back
laughingly
come
in
and
have
some
wo
you
no
thank
you
he
answered
you
are
too
generous
but
i
say
lloyd
let
down
a
basket
or
something
wo
you
i
got
a
surprise
here
for
you
all
take
the
betty
said
lloyd
excitedly
pointing
to
a
fancy
little
basket
made
of
braided
sweet
grass
and
tied
with
many
bows
my
is
in
the
closet
you
can
let
it
down
by
that
if
you
tie
it
to
the
handles
a
moment
later
betty
smiling
face
appeared
at
the
window
and
the
basket
was
lowered
to
the
boy
on
the
horse
below
i
ca
reach
it
without
standing
up
on
the
saddle
called
rob
whoa
there
ben
easy
old
boy
with
feet
wide
apart
to
balance
himself
rob
carefully
dropped
something
from
the
basket
he
carried
on
his
arm
to
the
one
that
betty
dangled
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
one
for
you
too
betty
the
girls
heard
him
say
but
he
had
cantered
off
down
the
avenue
before
they
discovered
what
it
was
he
had
left
for
them
betty
carefully
drew
the
basket
in
fearful
lest
the
rope
might
slip
for
the
surprise
was
heavy
as
she
landed
it
safely
and
turned
the
basket
over
on
the
floor
out
rolled
four
fat
little
puppies
what
darlings
cried
lloyd
springing
off
her
cot
to
catch
up
one
of
the
plump
little
things
as
it
sprawled
toward
her
on
its
awkward
paws
they
are
so
much
alike
we
never
be
able
to
tell
them
apart
unless
we
tie
different
coloured
ribbons
on
them
i
going
to
name
mine
bob
after
robby
he
gave
them
to
us
let
name
them
all
that
said
betty
we
be
taking
them
away
to
different
places
soon
so
it
will
not
make
any
difference
the
suggestion
was
received
with
applause
and
eugenia
sent
eliot
to
her
trunk
for
a
piece
of
pale
green
ribbon
i
going
to
have
my
necktie
match
my
room
she
said
we
all
do
that
too
said
joyce
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
four
bobs
were
frisking
clumsily
over
the
floor
in
their
respective
bows
of
pink
yellow
blue
and
green
they
afforded
the
girls
entertainment
all
that
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
there
was
another
surprise
in
the
starlight
when
it
was
dark
enough
for
the
blinds
and
shutters
to
be
all
thrown
open
in
their
rooms
they
heard
a
carriage
coming
down
the
avenue
it
too
stopped
under
the
window
and
in
a
moment
they
recognised
the
twang
of
malcolm
banjo
and
miss
allison
guitar
a
serenade
called
eugenia
what
a
good
alto
voice
keith
has
it
was
an
old
college
tune
that
rose
on
the
air
miss
allison
had
parodied
the
words
of
the
peanut
song
any
fellow
that
has
any
and
giveth
his
neighbour
none
he
have
any
of
measles
when
his
are
gone
oh
that
will
be
joyful
joyful
oh
that
will
be
joyful
when
his
are
gone
then
they
sang
my
love
is
like
the
red
red
rose
and
pop
goes
the
weasel
the
queen
got
the
measles
they
were
all
silly
little
ditties
but
the
personal
allusions
made
them
interesting
to
the
girls
and
there
was
a
storm
of
applause
from
the
upper
windows
after
each
one
sherman
brought
out
cake
and
lemonade
to
the
serenaders
and
the
girls
hung
out
of
the
windows
as
far
as
they
dared
to
see
what
was
going
on
below
if
we
only
had
gone
to
that
horrid
old
gypsy
camp
lamented
the
little
colonel
we
might
be
down
there
now
having
a
share
of
the
good
time
what
you
all
laughing
at
she
called
it
is
simply
maddening
to
be
up
here
and
listen
to
you
and
not
know
malcolm
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
to
sing
teasingly
thou
art
so
near
and
yet
so
far
adding
never
mind
lloyd
we
come
again
and
bring
a
travelling
show
with
us
look
out
for
us
early
in
the
morning
before
it
begins
to
get
hot
what
do
you
suppose
those
boys
are
going
to
do
asked
eugenia
as
lloyd
drew
in
her
head
and
the
carriage
rolled
off
the
serenaders
still
singing
i
have
the
faintest
idea
there
nothing
to
do
but
wait
and
see
although
the
question
was
asked
several
times
that
evening
before
bedtime
and
the
girls
amused
themselves
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
guessing
what
kind
of
a
travelling
show
was
to
be
brought
by
for
their
entertainment
not
one
of
them
thought
of
it
again
next
morning
the
doctor
had
decided
that
their
eyes
were
well
enough
to
bear
the
light
and
at
his
visit
threw
open
several
of
the
blinds
sherman
drove
down
to
the
station
and
mom
beck
went
to
the
servants
cottage
only
eliot
was
left
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
invalids
and
she
had
been
invited
to
bring
her
sewing
and
listen
to
a
story
that
betty
was
reading
aloud
they
had
grown
very
fond
of
patient
old
eliot
for
she
had
been
the
kindest
and
best
of
nurses
in
their
illness
the
girls
were
all
lounging
around
the
room
in
wrappers
each
with
her
own
particular
bob
in
her
lap
the
reading
had
gone
on
for
about
half
an
hour
when
eliot
sewing
suddenly
slid
from
her
lap
to
the
floor
and
a
queer
rattle
in
her
throat
made
every
one
look
up
in
alarm
at
first
they
thought
that
she
must
be
having
some
kind
of
a
fit
her
hands
were
thrown
up
her
mouth
dropped
open
there
was
a
look
of
wild
terror
in
her
staring
eyes
and
her
face
was
deathly
pale
it
was
terrifying
to
see
a
grown
woman
seem
so
frightened
she
was
pointing
to
the
door
and
as
their
eyes
followed
her
shaking
finger
they
forgot
her
fear
in
their
own
fright
there
standing
on
its
hind
legs
in
the
door
was
an
enormous
bear
taller
than
any
man
they
had
ever
seen
its
mouth
was
open
and
a
long
red
tongue
hung
out
between
its
gleaming
teeth
trailing
behind
him
was
a
heavy
rope
that
showed
that
he
had
broken
away
from
some
place
of
confinement
illustration
there
was
one
wild
scream
after
another
there
was
one
wild
scream
after
another
as
the
girls
sprang
up
spilling
the
four
bobs
out
of
their
laps
to
the
floor
eugenia
rolled
under
the
bed
in
such
mad
haste
that
she
bumped
her
head
against
the
footboard
crying
in
an
imploring
tone
as
she
disappeared
oh
eat
me
do
eat
me
joyce
scrambled
up
on
a
high
chest
of
drawers
and
from
there
to
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
where
she
sat
panting
and
looking
down
at
the
bear
who
seemed
surprised
at
his
reception
after
one
frightened
scream
betty
buried
her
head
in
a
sofa
pillow
like
a
little
ostrich
and
made
no
attempt
to
escape
she
seemed
glued
to
her
chair
the
little
colonel
who
had
stumbled
over
all
of
the
four
bobbies
in
her
confusion
and
fallen
on
top
of
them
as
she
tried
to
scramble
up
from
her
knees
gave
one
more
startled
look
at
the
intruder
and
then
sprang
up
with
an
angry
cry
it
that
old
tramp
beah
that
belongs
to
malcolm
and
keith
she
exclaimed
in
a
great
passion
the
girls
had
never
seen
her
in
such
a
fury
get
out
of
heah
mistah
she
shrieked
stamping
her
foot
and
scowling
darkly
this
is
the
second
time
you
have
neahly
frightened
me
to
death
get
out
of
heah
i
say
or
i
break
every
bone
in
yo
body
she
had
been
so
startled
by
eliot
appearance
and
then
the
general
outcry
that
her
nervousness
passed
into
a
rage
picking
up
the
book
that
betty
had
been
reading
she
hurled
it
at
the
astonished
bear
with
all
her
force
eliot
followed
next
and
the
pillows
from
the
bed
and
sofa
next
she
tore
off
her
slippers
and
sent
them
flying
against
the
brown
furry
back
now
turned
toward
her
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
such
a
shower
of
spools
and
needles
scissors
buttons
and
wearing
apparel
old
bruin
dropped
on
all
fours
and
ambled
out
of
the
doorway
just
as
lloyd
caught
up
the
water
pitcher
a
panting
little
coloured
boy
met
him
on
the
stairs
and
caught
up
the
rope
trailing
behind
him
he
wo

miss
lloyd
he
called
assuringly
he
to
mistah
keith
an
mistah

toreckly

them
now
the
beah
ai

to
hurt
you
oh
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
beah
answered
lloyd
but
i
hate
to
be
surprised
it
came
walkin
in
on
us
so
easy
that
i
did
have
time
to
see
that
it
was
only
an
old
tame
beah
it
stood
up
on
its
hind
legs
lookin
twice
as
big
as
usual
and
when
everybody
screamed
and
carried
on
so
i
did
know
what
i
was
doin
as
soon
as
i
realised
that
it
was
the
boys
pet
i
was
afraid
but
it
made
me
mad
to
be
startled
that
way
and
that
the
second
time
it
has
happened
is
he
gone
asked
eugenia
poking
her
head
slowly
out
from
under
the
bed
like
a
cautious
turtle
yes
wash
has
him
answered
the
little
colonel
laughing
hysterically
now
that
her
temper
had
spent
itself
you
girls
look
too
funny
for
any
use
come
down
off
your
perch
on
that
wardrobe
joyce
it
was
only
an
old
pet
that
the
boys
bought
from
a
tramp
one
time
they
keep
it
up
at
the
home
that
macintyre
founded
for
little
waifs
and
strays
i
that
is
what
malcolm
meant
by
a
travellin
show
i
might
have
thought
of
that
for
they
are
always
makin
it
show
off
its
tricks
eliot
had
found
her
voice
by
this
time
and
was
sitting
limply
back
in
her
chair
with
her
hand
over
her
heart
if
that
is
their
travelling
show
she
said
weakly
i
wish
they
choose
another
road
i
was
that
scared
i
could
have
spoken
a
word
if
my
life
had
depended
on
it
and
all
the
time
i
was
trying
my
hardest
to
scream
i
thought
it
was
a
wild
beast
that
had
walked
in
from
the
woods
to
devour
us
all
but
eliot
said
the
little
colonel
still
laughing
you
know
we
do
have
wild
beasts
in
these
woods
nowadays
there
has
been
any
for
yeahs
and
yeahs
but
eliot
shook
her
head
doubtfully
and
when
the
boys
came
up
with
a
banjo
and
french
harp
to
put
the
bear
through
his
performances
she
watched
the
dancing
at
a
respectful
distance
she
was
not
at
all
sure
about
her
safety
after
that
as
long
as
she
was
in
sight
of
the
kentucky
woods
she
could
not
be
convinced
that
all
sorts
of
ravenous
beasts
were
not
lurking
in
their
shadows
and
would
not
have
been
surprised
at
any
time
to
have
met
a
live
indian
in
and
feathers
eugenia
frenzied
wail
became
a
byword
and
for
many
days
one
had
only
to
say
oh
eat
me
to
start
a
peal
of
laughter
chapter
xi
some
stories
and
a
poem
what
is
the
worst
thing
you
evah
did
in
yo
life
joyce
asked
the
little
colonel
it
was
the
first
day
after
their
recovery
from
the
measles
that
the
girls
had
been
allowed
to
go
and
they
were
trying
to
amuse
themselves
in
the
library
time
had
dragged
for
the
last
and
lloyd
question
was
welcomed
with
interest
um
i
do
know
answered
joyce
half
closing
her
eyes
as
she
tried
to
remember
i
done
so
many
bad
things
that
i
have
been
ashamed
of
afterward
that
i
can
hardly
tell
which
is
the
worst
one
of
the
meanest
things
i
ever
did
was
when
i
was
too
small
to
know
how
cruel
it
was
it
was
so
long
ago
that
i
could
not
talk
plainly
but
i
remember
distinctly
what
a
stifling
hot
day
it
was
mamma
had
been
packing
her
furs
away
for
the
summer
in
you
know
how
horridly
those
camphor
things
smell
i
hung
over
her
and
asked
questions
every
time
she
moved
she
told
me
how
the
lay
eggs
in
the
furs
if
they
are
not
protected
and
showed
me
an
old
muff
that
she
had
found
in
the
attic
which
was
so
badly
that
it
had
to
be
thrown
away
i
watched
her
lay
the
little
balls
all
among
the
furs
and
then
tie
them
up
in
linen
bags
and
pack
them
away
in
a
chest
it
happened
that
i
had
an
old
cat
named
muff
and
as
soon
as
mamma
had
gone
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
pack
her
away
in
camphor
balls
so
i
put
her
into
an
old
with
a
handful
of
suffocating
and
tied
her
up
tight
she
mewed
and
scratched
at
a
terrible
rate
but
i
tugged
away
at
the
heavy
lid
of
the
chest
until
i
got
it
open
and
then
pop
went
poor
old
muff
in
with
the
other
furs
luckily
mamma
found
an
astrakhan
cape
several
hours
later
that
she
had
overlooked
and
went
back
to
the
attic
to
put
it
into
the
chest
or
the
poor
cat
would
have
smothered
when
she
raised
the
lid
there
was
that
squirming
around
as
if
it
were
alive
it
frightened
her
so
that
she
jumped
back
and
dropped
the
lid
and
then
stood
screaming
for
bridget
i
did
know
what
had
startled
her
and
she
did
not
know
that
i
had
any
connection
with
it
for
i
stood
looking
on
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
with
my
thumb
in
my
mouth
when
bridget
came
and
saw
the
squirming
and
bumping
around
she
said
an
it
bewitched
them
furs
is
and
i
not
be
afther
touching
wid
a
pole
i
run
call
the
next
dure
so
she
put
her
head
out
at
the
attic
window
and
screamed
for
dennis
and
dennis
thought
the
house
was
on
fire
and
came
running
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
he
untied
the
and
turned
it
upside
down
with
a
hard
shake
and
of
course
out
bounced
poor
old
muff
in
a
shower
of
nearly
smothered
from
being
shut
up
so
long
with
that
stifling
odour
she
was
sick
all
day
and
bridget
said
that
it
was
a
lucky
thing
that
cats
have
nine
lives
or
she
could
have
gotten
over
it
i
cried
because
they
had
let
her
out
and
said
i
did
want
the
nasty
moths
to
spoil
my
kitty
fur
and
mamma
laughed
so
hard
that
she
sat
right
down
on
the
attic
floor
then
she
took
me
in
her
lap
and
explained
how
muff
took
care
of
her
own
fur
and
did
not
need
to
be
packed
away
in
the
that
makes
me
think
of
a
scrape
that
lloyd
and
i
got
into
said
eugenia
when
she
lived
in
new
york
we
had
seen
a
mattress
sent
away
from
the
house
to
be
renovated
and
had
asked
the
nurse
all
sorts
of
questions
about
it
we
concluded
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
renovate
the
mattress
of
one
of
our
so
we
ripped
one
end
open
and
pulled
out
all
the
cotton
and
excelsior
it
was
stuffed
with
and
burned
it
in
the
nursery
grate
then
we
began
to
look
around
the
house
for
something
to
refill
it
with
down
in
the
library
was
a
beautiful
fur
rug
i
do
remember
what
kind
of
a
wild
beast
it
was
made
from
i
was
so
little
then
you
know
but
papa
was
very
proud
of
it
for
he
had
killed
the
animal
himself
out
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
had
had
the
skin
made
into
a
rug
as
a
souvenir
of
that
hunting
trip
it
had
the
head
left
on
it
and
we
were
a
little
afraid
of
that
head
the
glass
eyes
glared
so
savagely
and
the
teeth
were
so
sharp
in
its
open
jaws
but
the
fur
was
long
and
soft
and
thick
and
we
decided
to
shear
off
a
little
to
stuff
our
mattress
with
we
thought
it
would
take
much
so
i
took
the
nurse
scissors
and
we
slipped
down
into
the
library
with
the
empty
the
beast
eyes
seemed
to
look
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
was
afraid
to
touch
it
until
lloyd
put
a
sofa
pillow
over
its
head
and
sat
down
on
it
then
i
began
to
shear
off
a
little
near
the
tail
where
i
thought
it
would
show
much
but
the
mattress
did
fill
up
very
fast
so
i
kept
on
shearing
a
little
farther
and
a
little
farther
here
a
patch
and
there
a
patch
until
i
had
taken
a
great
streak
out
of
the
middle
of
the
back
and
the
rug
was
ruined
what
did
your
father
say
asked
joyce
oh
he
was
furious
he
said
a
child
ought
to
know
better
than
to
do
a
thing
like
that
and
if
she
did
she
should
be
taught
but
mamma
would
let
him
touch
me
and
only
scolded
the
nurse
for
not
watching
me
more
closely
now
it
is
betty
turn
said
joyce
when
the
giggling
that
followed
eugenia
tale
had
subsided
what
mischief
did
you
get
into
betty
before
she
could
reply
there
was
a
step
in
the
hall
a
tap
at
the
open
door
and
a
pleasant
voice
said
good
morning
young
ladies
oh
it
is
the
minister
wife
brewster
whispered
lloyd
jumping
up
from
the
sofa
and
going
forward
to
greet
her
there
was
no
need
of
introductions
for
the
girls
had
met
the
old
lady
several
times
mothah
is
heah
brewster
said
lloyd
she
went
to
town
this
mawnin
on
the
early
train
but
we
are
lookin
fo
her
to
come
on
this
next
train
and
we
are
just
dyin
fo
company
wo
you
come
in
an
wait
please
involuntarily
on
her
arrival
the
girls
stopped
lolling
in
their
chairs
and
sat
up
straight
with
their
hands
folded
primly
in
their
laps
brewster
had
an
air
of
quiet
dignity
that
always
made
people
want
to
be
on
their
best
behaviour
before
her
every
one
in
the
valley
was
fond
of
the
minister
wife
but
most
people
stood
in
awe
of
her
and
considered
the
turn
of
their
sentences
and
the
pitch
of
their
voices
when
talking
to
her
she
never
had
a
pin
awry
her
gray
hair
was
always
as
smooth
as
a
brush
could
make
it
and
every
breadth
of
her
skirts
always
fell
in
straight
precise
folds
from
to
there
was
never
a
wrinkle
or
a
spot
but
the
little
colonel
felt
no
awe
she
had
discovered
that
under
that
prim
exterior
was
a
heart
thoroughly
in
sympathy
with
all
her
childish
joys
and
griefs
and
in
consequence
the
two
had
become
warm
friends
lloyd
stood
beside
the
where
she
had
seated
brewster
and
waved
a
big
fan
so
vigorously
that
the
fluttered
and
a
lock
of
gray
hair
was
blown
out
of
place
and
straggled
across
the
placid
brow
we
were
tellin
each
othah
about
some
of
the
worst
things
we
evah
did
in
ou
lives
brewster
said
lloyd
wo
you
tell
us
about
some
of
the
things
you
did
when
you
were
a
naughty
little
girl
brewster
laughed
few
people
would
have
remembered
that
she
had
ever
been
a
little
girl
and
only
the
little
colonel
would
have
dared
to
intimate
that
she
had
been
a
naughty
one
for
she
was
one
of
those
dignified
persons
who
look
as
if
they
had
always
been
proper
and
grown
up
that
is
a
long
time
ago
to
look
back
to
dear
she
began
i
was
very
strictly
brought
up
and
the
training
of
my
conscience
began
so
early
that
i
was
always
a
good
child
in
the
main
i
think
i
was
more
timid
than
my
brothers
and
sisters
which
may
account
for
some
of
my
goodness
and
for
the
most
daring
deed
i
ever
did
i
was
punished
so
severely
that
it
had
a
restraining
effect
on
me
ever
after
what
was
that
asked
lloyd
with
such
an
air
of
interest
that
brewster
looking
around
on
the
listening
faces
was
beguiled
into
telling
it
it
was
when
we
lived
in
a
little
new
england
village
and
i
was
about
eight
years
old
although
i
was
a
very
quiet
child
i
dearly
loved
company
and
always
felt
a
delicious
thrill
of
excitement
when
i
heard
that
the
dorcas
sewing
society
was
to
be
entertained
at
our
house
or
that
some
one
was
coming
to
tea
mother
thought
that
growing
children
should
eat
only
the
simplest
most
wholesome
dishes
so
usually
we
had
very
frugal
fare
but
on
state
occasions
a
great
many
tempting
goodies
were
set
out
i
remember
that
we
always
had
spiced
buns
and
tarts
and
a
certain
kind
of
plum
marmalade
that
mother
had
great
skill
in
making
it
was
highly
praised
by
every
one
but
it
was
not
alone
for
these
things
that
i
was
in
a
state
of
complete
happiness
from
the
time
the
company
arrived
until
they
departed
i
enjoyed
listening
to
every
word
that
was
said
an
hour
before
the
guests
began
to
arrive
i
would
station
myself
at
the
window
to
watch
for
them
i
loved
to
see
the
ladies
stepping
primly
down
the
garden
path
in
their
best
gowns
between
the
stiff
borders
of
box
and
privet
stopping
to
admire
mother
hollyhocks
or
laburnum
bushes
children
were
seen
and
not
heard
in
those
days
and
as
soon
as
they
had
been
ushered
into
the
guest
chamber
where
they
laid
aside
their
wraps
and
had
seated
themselves
in
the
parlour
i
used
to
carry
my
little
stool
in
and
sit
down
in
one
corner
to
listen
one
autumn
it
happened
that
for
several
reasons
mother
had
had
no
invited
company
for
weeks
i
was
hungry
for
some
of
the
tarts
and
marmalade
that
i
knew
would
appear
if
the
guests
would
only
arrive
and
one
night
a
plan
came
into
my
head
that
seemed
to
me
so
clever
that
i
could
hardly
wait
for
morning
to
come
in
order
that
i
might
carry
it
out
mother
sent
me
on
an
errand
to
the
village
store
next
day
and
on
the
way
i
stopped
at
the
doctor
house
i
could
scarcely
reach
the
great
brass
knocker
on
the
front
door
but
when
i
did
standing
on
tiptoe
it
sent
such
a
loud
clamour
through
the
house
that
my
heart
jumped
up
in
my
throat
and
i
was
minded
to
run
away
but
before
i
could
do
that
the
doctor
wife
opened
the
door
i
made
my
best
courtesy
that
mother
had
carefully
taught
me
and
then
was
so
embarrassed
i
could
not
lift
my
eyes
from
the
ground
when
i
spoke
my
voice
sounded
so
meek
and
shy
and
high
up
in
the
air
that
i
scarcely
recognised
it
as
mine
mayfair
please
come
to
tea
i
said
then
i
courtesied
again
and
hurried
off
while
mayfair
was
calling
after
me
to
tell
my
mother
that
it
gave
her
great
pleasure
to
accept
her
invitation
but
you
see
it
was
mother
invitation
i
did
say
says
please
come
to
tea
i
just
asked
them
to
come
of
my
own
accord
in
a
fit
of
reckless
daring
and
then
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
i
invited
nearly
all
the
dorcas
society
and
what
happened
asked
the
little
colonel
eagerly
brewster
laughed
at
the
remembrance
such
a
contagious
hearty
laugh
that
her
shook
i
never
said
a
word
about
it
at
home
but
next
day
a
little
while
before
sundown
i
went
to
the
window
to
watch
for
them
mother
who
had
been
busy
all
day
boiling
cider
and
making
sat
down
with
her
knitting
to
rest
a
few
minutes
before
supper
she
said
she
was
tired
and
that
she
would
not
cook
much
that
mush
and
milk
would
be
enough
she
could
imagine
what
had
happened
when
all
the
ladies
appeared
and
she
sent
me
to
open
the
door
while
she
hurried
to
change
her
dress
i
followed
the
usual
programme
invited
them
into
the
to
lay
aside
their
wraps
and
mantles
and
then
gave
them
seats
in
the
parlour
mother
was
puzzled
when
she
came
in
and
saw
them
with
their
bonnets
off
for
she
supposed
when
she
saw
them
coming
down
the
path
that
they
were
a
committee
from
the
dorcas
society
on
some
business
but
presently
one
of
the
ladies
patted
me
on
the
head
and
complimented
my
pretty
manners
in
delivering
the
invitation
to
tea
if
a
piece
of
the
sky
had
fallen
mother
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
it
then
she
only
smiled
and
made
a
pleasant
answer
i
began
to
feel
very
comfortable
and
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
success
of
my
little
plan
presently
she
excused
herself
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
her
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
or
even
a
glance
of
reproach
she
bade
me
run
across
the
street
and
ask
my
aunt
rachel
and
her
daughter
milly
to
come
over
at
once
and
help
her
prepare
for
the
unexpected
guests
they
were
both
of
them
quick
capable
women
and
fine
housekeepers
and
around
as
they
expressed
it
in
such
a
marvellous
way
that
at
the
proper
time
the
customary
feast
was
spread
it
did
look
so
good
i
walked
around
the
table
my
mouth
watering
as
i
looked
at
the
tarts
and
marmalade
and
spiced
buns
and
all
the
other
tempting
dishes
mother
watched
me
do
it
and
then
just
before
she
invited
the
ladies
out
to
the
table
she
sent
me
off
to
bed
without
a
morsel
to
eat
not
even
a
spoonful
of
mush
and
milk
i
lay
in
an
adjoining
room
listening
to
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
and
the
ladylike
hum
of
conversation
and
knew
that
the
good
things
were
slowly
but
surely
disappearing
and
that
i
could
not
have
a
taste
i
was
so
hungry
and
disappointed
that
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
that
disappointment
and
the
lecture
which
followed
next
morning
was
punishment
enough
and
you
may
be
sure
that
that
was
the
last
time
i
ever
invited
my
mother
friends
on
my
own
responsibility
brewster
paused
amid
the
girls
laughing
exclamations
and
just
then
sherman
came
in
from
the
train
hot
and
dusty
and
her
arms
full
of
little
packages
come
on
up
to
my
room
with
me
she
said
to
brewster
who
was
a
frequent
and
familiar
visitor
at
locust
do
take
her
away
begged
the
little
colonel
she
is
entertaining
us
my
turn
now
laughed
sherman
and
the
two
ladies
went
once
more
leaving
the
girls
to
the
task
of
providing
their
own
amusement
was
that
a
picture
said
joyce
when
brewster
had
left
the
room
ca
you
just
see
it
that
quaint
little
girl
in
her
dress
going
from
door
to
door
with
her
courtesies
and
her
invitations
and
afterward
all
the
ladies
coming
down
the
path
between
the
rows
of
hollyhocks
i
love
to
draw
that
picture
if
i
could
try
it
urged
the
girls
so
warmly
that
joyce
went
for
her
drawing
material
betty
watched
her
spread
her
paper
on
the
library
table
i
believe
that
i
could
put
that
story
into
rhyme
she
said
after
a
few
minutes
of
silent
thought
i
can
feel
it
humming
in
my
head
oh
i
did
know
that
you
could
write
poetry
exclaimed
lloyd
try
it
now
and
see
what
you
can
do
you
write
the
poem
and
joyce
will
illustrate
it
i
have
to
be
by
myself
when
i
write
and
i
never
know
how
long
it
will
take
it
is
like
making
butter
sometimes
it
will
come
in
a
few
minutes
and
sometimes
i
have
to
churn
away
for
hours
begin
anyhow
insisted
the
girls
and
in
a
few
minutes
betty
slipped
away
to
her
room
at
they
teased
her
to
show
them
what
she
had
written
but
she
had
only
a
few
lines
completed
and
would
not
let
them
see
even
the
paper
on
which
she
had
been
scribbling
after
lunch
the
others
went
to
their
rooms
to
write
letters
and
sleep
awhile
but
she
went
back
to
her
task
joyce
picture
did
not
turn
out
to
her
satisfaction
and
she
tore
it
up
but
betty
did
her
work
over
and
over
rewriting
each
line
many
times
when
they
were
all
dressed
for
dinner
she
did
not
appear
finally
joyce
went
to
see
what
kept
her
so
long
she
found
her
bending
over
the
paper
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
eyes
shining
it
is
done
she
cried
writing
the
last
word
with
a
flourish
but
i
had
any
idea
it
was
so
late
i
thought
i
had
been
up
here
only
a
few
minutes
some
of
the
rhymes
just
twist
into
shape
but
i
think
they
fit
now
i
going
to
take
it
down
and
show
it
to
the
girls
while
you
dress
cried
joyce
catching
up
the
paper
and
running
off
with
it
although
betty
knew
the
time
was
short
and
she
ought
to
hurry
she
could
not
resist
stealing
to
the
banister
and
leaning
over
to
hear
how
it
sounded
when
her
godmother
who
was
sitting
in
the
lower
hall
with
lloyd
and
eugenia
read
it
aloud
jemima
araminta
knew
whenever
company
sat
round
the
frugal
board
they
had
plum
marmalade
for
tea
and
spiced
buns
and
toothsome
tarts
and
divers
sweets
beside
were
set
to
tempt
the
appetite
with
good
housewifely
pride
while
walking
out
one
day
it
chanced
she
fell
sore
a
wicked
thought
in
her
small
mind
did
tempt
her
more
and
more
at
all
the
neighbours
doors
she
paused
demure
and
shy
was
she
with
downcast
eyes
she
courtesied
and
said
come
to
next
day
along
the
garden
path
just
as
the
sun
went
down
a
score
of
ladies
primly
walked
each
in
her
sabbath
gown
surprised
her
mother
heard
them
say
dear
child
so
shy
is
she
what
pretty
manners
she
did
have
when
asking
us
to
tea
jemima
now
remembers
well
they
once
had
company
preserves
and
buns
and
toothsome
tarts
when
a
taste
had
she
for
supperless
to
bed
that
night
she
went
severely
chid
no
more
the
neighbours
to
invite
save
at
her
mother
bid
bravo
little
girl
cried
sherman
while
the
girls
clapped
loudly
have
you
anything
else
with
you
that
you
have
written
if
you
have
bring
it
down
with
you
when
you
come
yes
godmother
answered
betty
over
the
banister
blushing
until
she
could
feel
her
cheeks
burn
she
was
all
at
the
thought
of
her
godmother
seeing
her
verses
she
wanted
her
to
see
them
and
yet
she
take
down
her
old
ledger
for
them
all
to
read
and
criticise
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
eugenia
read
her
verses
on
friendship
and
there
was
one
about
dead
hopes
that
she
felt
none
of
them
would
understand
they
might
even
laugh
at
it
several
minutes
went
by
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
when
she
went
she
had
put
the
old
ledger
back
into
her
trunk
and
carried
only
one
of
the
loose
leaves
in
her
hands
i
show
the
others
to
godmother
sometime
when
we
are
alone
she
said
to
herself
as
she
went
shyly
up
to
the
group
waiting
for
her
here
is
one
i
called
she
said
her
cheeks
flaming
with
embarrassment
there
are
four
verses
sherman
took
it
and
glancing
down
the
lines
read
aloud
the
little
poem
commencing
oh
peaceful
night
thou
shadowy
queen
who
rules
the
realms
of
shade
thy
throne
is
on
the
heaven
arch
thy
crown
of
stars
is
made
oh
betty
that
splendid
cried
the
girls
in
chorus
how
could
you
think
of
it
it
is
remarkably
good
for
a
little
girl
of
twelve
said
sherman
glancing
over
the
last
verses
again
but
i
am
not
surprised
your
mother
wrote
some
beautiful
things
she
scribbled
verses
all
the
time
oh
i
did
know
that
cried
betty
how
i
wish
i
could
see
some
of
them
you
shall
my
dear
i
have
an
old
portfolio
in
the
library
full
of
such
things
poems
that
she
wrote
and
pictures
that
joyce
mother
drew
caricatures
of
the
professors
the
little
pen
and
ink
sketches
of
the
places
in
the
valley
we
loved
the
best
i
get
them
out
for
you
after
dinner
you
will
all
be
interested
in
them
especially
in
a
journal
they
kept
for
me
one
summer
when
i
was
at
the
seashore
one
kept
a
record
of
all
that
happened
in
the
valley
during
my
absence
and
the
other
illustrated
it
dinner
is
ready
now
said
lloyd
jumping
up
as
the
maid
opened
the
door
as
they
all
rose
to
go
in
sherman
lingered
a
moment
in
the
hall
to
take
the
paper
from
betty
hand
will
you
give
me
this
little
poem
dear
she
asked
slipping
an
arm
around
the
child
waist
i
am
very
proud
of
my
little
the
world
will
hear
from
you
some
day
if
you
keep
on
singing
just
do
your
bravest
and
best
and
it
will
be
glad
to
listen
to
your
music
she
stooped
and
kissed
betty
lightly
on
the
forehead
it
was
as
if
she
had
set
the
seal
of
her
approval
upon
her
and
to
be
approved
by
her
beautiful
godmother
ah
that
meant
more
to
the
devoted
little
heart
than
any
one
could
dream
far
more
even
than
if
she
had
been
made
the
proud
laureate
of
a
queen
chapter
xii
a
party
they
were
all
sitting
on
the
porch
looking
out
between
the
tall
white
pillars
into
the
sultry
june
darkness
the
light
from
the
hall
lamp
streamed
across
the
steps
where
the
four
bobs
rolled
and
tumbled
around
over
each
other
but
except
for
that
one
broad
path
of
light
they
could
see
nothing
there
was
not
even
starlight
how
hot
and
still
it
is
said
sherman
there
does
seem
to
be
a
leaf
stirring
and
there
not
a
star
in
sight
i
think
it
will
surely
storm
before
morning
betty
said
joyce
your
queen
who
rules
the
realms
of
has
forgotten
to
put
on
her
crown
now
if
i
could
write
poetry
like
some
people
i
know
i
would
write
an
ode
to
night
and
compare
it
to
a
stack
of
black
cats
it
would
sound
so
pretty
as
your
description
but
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
well
cats
or
queens
it
does
make
any
difference
what
you
call
it
said
the
little
colonel
it
the
stupidest
night
i
evah
saw
i
wish
something
would
happen
it
seems
ages
since
we
have
done
anything
lively
now
that
we
are
ovah
the
measles
it
wastin
time
to
be
heah
so
poky
and
stupid
what
can
we
do
mothah
let
tell
ghost
stories
said
sherman
who
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
in
a
short
time
and
wanted
to
keep
the
girls
occupied
until
then
i
know
a
fine
one
she
began
sinking
her
voice
to
a
creepy
undertone
that
made
the
girls
cast
uneasy
glances
behind
them
it
all
about
a
haunted
house
that
has
clanking
chains
in
the
cellar
and
muffled
footsteps
and
icy
fingers
that
you
by
the
throat
on
the
stairs
as
the
clock
tolls
the
midnight
hour
ugh
how
good
and
spooky
said
joyce
with
a
little
shiver
i
love
that
kind
they
drew
their
chairs
around
sherman
to
listen
so
interested
in
the
story
that
two
of
the
bobs
rolled
over
each
other
and
off
the
high
porch
and
nobody
noticed
their
whining
presently
in
the
most
thrilling
part
of
her
story
sherman
paused
and
pointed
impressively
down
the
avenue
what
is
it
ghosts
shrieked
the
little
colonel
her
teeth
chattering
and
in
such
haste
to
throw
herself
into
her
mother
arms
that
her
chair
turned
over
with
a
bang
it
is
a
party
answered
sherman
laughing
but
it
is
certainly
the
most
affair
that
i
ever
saw
down
the
long
avenue
toward
them
came
a
wavering
line
of
masked
figures
they
had
square
heads
and
great
round
holes
for
eyes
and
the
candle
that
each
one
carried
flashed
across
a
hideous
grinning
face
whose
mouth
and
nose
had
been
drawn
with
burnt
cork
the
leader
of
this
strange
procession
was
a
veritable
giant
the
goliath
of
all
the
ghosts
for
he
loomed
up
above
them
to
nearly
twice
the
height
of
the
tallest
one
in
the
line
it
took
two
sheets
to
cover
him
one
flapped
about
his
long
thin
legs
and
one
swung
from
his
shoulders
swaying
from
side
to
side
as
he
moved
noiselessly
along
with
gigantic
strides
oh
mothah
it
awful
whispered
the
little
colonel
clinging
around
sherman
neck
it
is
almost
enough
to
frighten
one
she
replied
but
they
are
all
friends
of
yours
lloyd
for
instance
the
giant
is
nobody
but
your
good
friend
and
playfellow
robby
moore
on
stilts
and
somewhere
in
that
bunch
of
little
tots
at
the
tail
end
of
the
procession
are
those
funny
little
cassidy
twins
bethel
and
ethel
they
begged
so
hard
to
be
allowed
to
come
that
their
mother
at
last
consented
although
they
are
only
six
years
old
she
said
she
would
dress
up
in
a
sheet
and
herself
and
come
with
them
to
see
that
nothing
happened
to
them
so
i
suppose
she
is
somewhere
in
the
line
i
was
told
that
everybody
in
the
neighbourhood
was
coming
old
people
as
well
as
children
but
i
leave
you
to
find
out
for
yourself
as
the
fun
of
a
party
like
this
is
in
the
guessing
they
will
unmask
before
they
go
home
the
procession
glided
on
in
silence
until
it
reached
the
house
and
then
ranged
itself
in
a
long
line
in
front
of
the
group
on
the
porch
there
are
whispered
joyce
i
counted
them
is
that
one
at
the
end
funny
that
one
in
a
tied
at
the
top
and
his
hands
sticking
out
of
the
slits
at
the
sides
like
fishes
fins
almost
sure
that
it
is
keith
i
could
tell
if
i
could
only
see
his
hands
but
he
has
white
stockings
drawn
over
them
the
figures
began
waving
to
and
fro
faster
and
faster
until
they
were
all
drawn
into
a
weird
uncanny
dance
in
which
each
one
flapped
or
writhed
or
swayed
back
and
forth
as
he
pleased
in
ghostly
silence
the
movements
of
the
ones
in
the
were
the
most
comical
and
the
little
audience
on
the
porch
laughed
until
they
could
only
gasp
and
hold
their
sides
at
a
signal
from
the
tall
leader
the
sheeted
party
suddenly
divided
half
of
the
masked
faces
grinning
on
one
side
of
the
steps
and
half
going
to
the
other
then
an
auction
began
one
side
being
sold
to
the
other
the
bidding
was
all
in
pantomime
and
they
all
looked
so
much
alike
that
nobody
knew
whom
he
was
bidding
for
or
to
whom
he
was
knocked
down
the
giant
was
the
auctioneer
at
last
each
bidder
was
provided
with
a
partner
and
two
by
two
they
all
went
gravely
up
the
steps
to
shake
hands
with
sherman
and
the
girls
every
one
spoke
in
an
assumed
voice
and
recognition
was
almost
impossible
the
girls
talked
with
every
one
in
turn
but
rob
and
keith
were
the
only
boys
they
had
recognised
when
the
signal
for
unmasking
was
given
and
little
bethel
cassidy
was
the
only
girl
they
knew
her
queer
little
lisp
cake
and
sherbet
were
brought
out
and
great
was
astonishment
when
masks
were
slipped
off
and
the
jerked
away
from
the
wearers
rumpled
hair
to
keith
disgust
he
found
that
the
partner
whom
he
had
bid
for
energetically
thinking
it
was
sally
fairfax
was
only
his
brother
malcolm
and
malcolm
teased
him
all
evening
by
quoting
aloud
some
of
the
complimentary
speeches
keith
had
whispered
to
him
under
cover
of
their
disguises
oh
gracious
roared
malcolm
it
was
funny
keith
fanning
me
with
one
of
those
stubby
little
fins
of
his
and
making
complimentary
speeches
about
my
eyes
told
me
he
would
know
them
anywhere
and
he
spouted
poetry
he
did
added
malcolm
doubling
up
with
another
laugh
oh
it
was
good
hi
buddy
chucking
keith
under
the
chin
are
you
of
the
same
opinion
still
ai
they
pretty
eyes
so
blue
and
tender
aw
hush
growled
keith
in
a
shamefaced
sort
of
way
adding
in
a
savage
undertone
i
make
eyes
of
if
you
do
stop
that
was
not
the
only
odd
assortment
of
partners
for
miss
allison
had
bid
for
plump
little
cassidy
thinking
it
was
one
of
the
boys
in
her
sunday
school
class
and
one
little
maid
of
seven
found
that
an
old
bachelor
uncle
had
fallen
to
her
lot
you
see
we
made
a
wholesale
affair
of
it
said
miss
allison
to
eugenia
we
drove
around
the
neighbourhood
in
two
big
wagonettes
and
picked
up
whole
families
at
a
time
it
is
the
jolliest
surprise
i
ever
saw
answered
eugenia
looking
all
around
at
the
little
groups
laughing
and
talking
over
their
refreshments
it
is
hard
to
tell
which
are
having
the
best
time
the
children
or
the
grown
people
they
are
all
mixed
up
together
as
she
spoke
the
buzz
of
voices
ceased
for
there
was
a
sudden
blinding
flash
of
lightning
and
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
that
made
the
windows
rattle
the
storm
which
sherman
had
predicted
would
come
before
morning
had
crept
up
unnoticed
and
caught
them
unawares
come
inside
cried
sherman
as
with
a
furious
rush
and
roar
the
wind
swept
across
them
banging
window
shutters
whirling
leaves
and
gravel
in
their
faces
and
lashing
the
trees
until
they
were
bent
almost
double
another
blinding
glare
of
lightning
followed
with
such
a
crash
of
thunder
that
eugenia
put
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
screamed
and
betty
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
hurry
cried
sherman
i
am
afraid
that
some
of
these
flying
shingles
or
whatever
they
are
will
hurt
some
one
it
is
almost
a
cyclone
breathless
and
excited
they
all
hurried
into
the
house
and
banged
the
great
front
door
in
the
face
of
the
storm
the
children
tumbled
into
the
the
smaller
ones
huddling
in
a
frightened
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
until
the
fury
of
the
storm
was
over
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
with
bated
breath
after
each
vivid
flash
of
lightning
for
the
terrific
crash
that
always
followed
and
listen
to
the
wind
outside
as
it
fought
with
the
sturdy
now
and
then
a
limb
snapped
in
the
fierce
struggle
and
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
loud
crackling
noise
i
hope
there
will
be
enough
of
a
roof
left
over
our
heads
to
shelter
us
said
sherman
as
bricks
from
the
chimney
tops
began
rolling
down
the
roof
and
falling
to
the
ground
below
with
heavy
thuds
we
expected
to
start
home
about
this
time
miss
allison
was
saying
we
ordered
the
wagonettes
to
come
back
for
us
at
ten
but
it
looks
now
as
if
we
are
for
the
night
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
downpour
it
the
clatter
of
the
rain
on
the
tin
roof
of
the
porch
answered
sherman
speaking
at
the
top
of
her
voice
in
order
to
be
heard
above
the
deafening
din
of
the
rain
and
wind
for
nearly
half
an
hour
they
sat
waiting
for
the
storm
to
pass
several
games
were
proposed
but
none
of
the
children
wanted
to
play
they
seemed
to
feel
more
comfortable
when
they
were
snuggled
up
close
against
some
grown
person
or
holding
some
elderly
protecting
hand
but
gradually
the
lightning
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
the
thunder
went
growling
away
in
the
distance
although
the
rain
kept
steadily
on
sherman
called
for
some
music
in
the
and
while
miss
allison
and
cassidy
played
the
liveliest
duets
they
knew
the
children
drifted
out
into
the
hall
and
over
the
house
as
they
pleased
most
of
the
older
boys
and
girls
sat
on
the
stairs
in
groups
of
twos
and
threes
while
from
the
upper
hall
the
scurry
of
feet
and
the
singsong
cry
that
london
bridge
was
falling
down
showed
what
the
little
ones
were
playing
it
was
after
eleven
when
the
wagonettes
came
rumbling
up
to
the
door
the
rain
had
stopped
and
a
few
stars
were
beginning
to
struggle
through
the
clouds
how
cold
and
damp
it
is
exclaimed
sherman
as
she
stepped
out
on
the
front
porch
the
thermometer
must
have
fallen
twenty
degrees
since
you
came
you
will
all
need
wraps
of
some
kind
wait
till
i
can
get
you
some
shawls
and
things
no
indeed
every
one
protested
we
will
wrap
up
in
our
sheets
again
we
do
not
need
anything
else
there
was
a
laughing
scrimmage
over
the
pile
of
sheets
that
had
been
thrown
hastily
into
one
corner
of
the
hall
when
the
party
ran
in
out
of
the
storm
nearly
all
the
masks
and
were
put
on
again
too
so
that
the
party
broke
up
in
laughing
confusion
nobody
recognised
his
neighbour
or
knew
who
he
was
bumping
against
as
he
hurried
up
to
bid
his
perplexed
hostess
good
night
with
a
great
cracking
of
whips
and
creaking
of
wheels
the
spectral
party
drove
off
to
the
tune
of
ladies
we
going
to
leave
you
now
far
down
the
road
the
chorus
came
floating
back
to
the
listeners
on
the
porch
merrily
we
roll
along
roll
along
roll
along
was
it
funny
yawned
lloyd
as
she
went
sleepily
up
the
stairs
but
oh
i
so
tiahed
i
believe
if
they
had
stayed
much
longah
have
fallen
ovah
in
a
heap
on
the
flo
all
the
lights
were
out
and
the
girls
were
nearly
undressed
when
they
were
surprised
to
hear
one
of
the
wagonettes
coming
back
a
frantic
clang
of
the
knocker
on
the
front
door
brought
them
all
to
the
windows
oh
mrs
sherman
cried
an
agonised
voice
out
of
the
darkness
that
they
recognised
as
cassidy
are
the
twins
here
bethel
and
ethel
we
ca
find
them
anywhere
i
was
sure
that
i
lifted
them
into
the
wagonette
myself
but
every
one
was
so
disguised
that
i
must
have
mistaken
somebody
else
children
for
mine
they
are
not
in
either
wagonette
added
rob
moore
voice
we
never
thought
to
count
noses
until
we
reached
the
cassidy
place
and
then
we
found
they
were
missing
hastily
slipping
into
a
wrapper
sherman
ran
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
opened
the
front
door
plump
little
cassidy
was
standing
there
wringing
her
hands
oh
tell
me
that
they
are
not
here
she
cried
did
you
see
them
when
you
were
locking
up
the
house
after
we
left
then
i
know
they
lost
they
must
have
slipped
away
from
the
porch
before
the
storm
came
up
and
were
playing
outside
somewhere
when
we
all
ran
inside
and
shut
the
door
oh
my
babies
she
wailed
if
they
were
out
in
all
that
awful
storm
it
has
killed
them
i
know
oh
why
did
i
do
such
a
foolish
thing
as
to
bring
them
they
were
too
little
to
come
i
knew
that
but
they
begged
so
hard
and
they
looked
so
cute
in
those
little
ruffled
that
i
had
the
heart
to
refuse
oh
what
shall
i
do
they
must
be
somewhere
about
the
house
said
sherman
with
such
decision
that
cassidy
was
comforted
and
began
wiping
her
eyes
come
in
and
help
me
search
maybe
they
slipped
when
the
other
children
were
playing
and
went
to
sleep
in
some
dark
corner
come
on
boys
light
up
the
house
from
attic
to
cellar
and
see
who
will
be
first
to
find
them
it
will
be
a
game
of
hunt
the
twins
instead
of
hunt
the
slipper
then
and
and
in
my
lady
chamber
went
a
strange
procession
for
nearly
every
one
was
still
draped
in
sheet
and
into
closets
behind
screens
in
all
the
corners
and
under
all
the
beds
they
looked
keith
remembering
the
sad
story
of
ginevra
even
lifted
the
lid
of
every
chest
and
trunk
in
the
linen
room
poor
little
cassidy
followed
wringing
her
hands
and
sobbing
that
she
knew
that
they
had
been
shut
outside
in
the
storm
and
the
night
suddenly
when
they
had
been
all
over
the
house
for
the
third
time
she
caught
up
a
lamp
and
ran
out
in
the
dark
like
some
poor
mad
creature
calling
oh
bethel
oh
my
little
ethel
do
you
hear
your
mother
by
this
time
the
servants
quarters
were
aroused
and
sherman
now
really
alarmed
called
for
walker
and
alec
to
bring
lanterns
the
lawn
was
a
wreck
strewn
with
leaves
and
fallen
limbs
and
pieces
of
broken
flower
urns
that
had
been
overturned
by
the
wind
the
searchers
stumbled
over
them
as
they
waded
through
the
wet
grass
looking
in
every
nook
and
corner
where
it
was
possible
for
a
child
to
have
strayed
but
their
search
was
in
vain
never
a
trace
did
they
find
of
the
lost
twins
stay
in
the
house
girls
said
sherman
as
she
caught
up
the
trail
of
her
wrapper
and
ran
out
to
follow
the
flickering
lanterns
and
cassidy
frantic
cries
it
might
give
you
your
death
of
cold
to
expose
yourselves
so
soon
after
the
measles
as
they
stood
in
the
door
watching
the
wavering
lights
lloyd
exclaimed
the
puppies
are
gone
too
i
wonder
where
they
can
be
maybe
they
were
left
outside
in
the
storm
when
we
all
ran
indoors
in
such
a
hurry
maybe
the
twins
were
playing
with
them
she
leaned
out
of
the
door
peering
into
the
night
heah
bob
she
called
snapping
her
fingers
and
whistling
the
shrill
signal
she
always
gave
when
she
fed
them
there
was
no
response
from
the
darkness
outside
and
she
turned
indoors
repeating
the
whistle
and
calling
heah
bob
heah
puppy
come
to
yo
miss
in
answer
there
was
a
stir
under
the
low
persian
couch
in
the
library
then
a
whine
and
an
inquiring
little
nose
was
thrust
through
the
heavy
knotted
fringe
that
draped
the
lower
part
of
the
couch
the
next
instant
lloyd
bob
came
sprawling
joyously
toward
her
his
pink
bow
cocked
rakishly
over
one
ear
lloyd
dropped
on
her
knees
and
lifting
the
fringe
looked
under
then
she
gave
an
excited
scream
heah
they
are
she
called
i
found
them
heah
the
twins
and
all
the
bobs
they
found
called
joyce
running
out
on
the
porch
and
shouting
the
news
until
the
searchers
farthest
from
the
house
heard
and
ran
joyfully
back
they
found
lloyd
found
them
who
ever
would
have
thought
of
squeezing
into
such
a
place
as
that
said
miss
allison
as
she
came
running
in
out
of
breath
i
started
to
look
under
that
couch
twice
but
it
was
so
low
i
thought
they
possibly
have
crawled
under
besides
some
one
was
sitting
on
it
all
evening
and
they
surely
would
have
been
seen
if
they
had
attempted
it
rob
and
malcolm
lifted
the
couch
and
set
it
aside
and
there
curled
up
on
two
fat
sofa
cushions
with
the
puppies
beside
them
lay
the
twins
fast
asleep
great
beads
of
perspiration
stood
on
their
foreheads
and
trickled
down
their
dimpled
faces
their
hair
curled
in
little
wet
rings
all
over
their
heads
and
their
chubby
arms
and
necks
were
red
with
prickly
heat
it
is
a
wonder
that
they
were
smothered
cried
cassidy
taking
them
up
in
her
arms
and
waking
them
with
her
tearful
kisses
oh
did
you
hide
away
from
mother
precious
she
asked
reproachfully
as
bethel
eyes
opened
with
a
dazed
stare
at
the
crowd
of
faces
around
her
she
leaned
her
head
heavily
on
her
mother
shoulder
for
she
was
not
fully
awake
and
clung
around
her
neck
with
both
arms
finally
in
answer
to
the
chorus
of
questions
that
came
from
all
sides
she
roused
enough
to
answer
it
lightened
that
why
we
hid
mammy
chloe
thed
if
you
go
get
in
a
dark
plathe
on
a
pile
of
featheths
no
lightnin

thithter
took
a

and

under
the
thofa
and
shut
our
eyeth
tight
we
wath
hot
she
added
gravely
and
tho
wath
the
puppieth
but
the
lightnin
could
get
uth
the
laugh
that
went
up
from
the
amused
listeners
aroused
both
the
twins
so
thoroughly
that
they
joined
in
without
knowing
what
they
were
laughing
about
then
alec
and
walker
carried
them
triumphantly
on
their
shoulders
to
the
wagonette
and
once
more
the
party
started
homeward
this
time
they
moved
off
without
singing
but
from
the
gate
came
back
three
cheers
for
the
twins
then
three
cheers
for
the
little
colonel
who
had
found
them
once
started
to
cheering
somebody
proposed
three
for
the
party
and
so
lustily
did
they
give
them
that
an
old
rooster
awakening
from
sleep
as
the
wheels
creaked
by
thought
it
the
call
of
some
giant
chanticleer
and
promptly
crowed
an
answering
challenge
that
was
echoed
by
every
cock
in
the
valley
chapter
xiii
more
measles
it
seemed
to
betty
that
that
night
would
never
end
it
was
after
midnight
before
the
house
grew
quiet
then
whenever
she
closed
her
eyes
she
could
see
those
ghostly
figures
dancing
before
her
in
a
long
white
wavering
line
after
awhile
she
gave
up
the
attempt
to
sleep
and
lay
with
her
eyes
wide
open
staring
into
the
darkness
alert
and
quivering
at
the
slightest
sound
i
do
know
what
makes
me
so
nervous
she
thought
i
feel
as
if
i
should
fly
and
the
dark
seems
so
horrible
as
if
it
was
full
of
creepy
crawling
things
with
horns
and
claws
a
beetle
boomed
against
the
window
striking
the
pane
with
a
heavy
thud
she
drew
the
sheet
over
her
head
and
shivered
maybe
if
i
read
awhile
it
would
make
me
sleepy
she
thought
and
slipping
softly
out
of
bed
she
groped
her
way
across
the
room
in
the
dark
to
the
lighting
a
candle
in
one
of
the
crystal
candlesticks
that
always
reminded
her
of
twisted
icicles
she
put
it
on
a
stand
beside
her
bed
the
light
flickered
unsteadily
but
she
piled
the
pillows
up
behind
her
and
settled
herself
to
read
it
was
a
new
book
that
she
was
greatly
interested
in
and
before
long
she
was
so
deep
in
the
story
that
she
never
noticed
how
the
time
was
flying
instead
of
bringing
sleep
to
her
eyes
it
seemed
to
drive
it
farther
and
farther
away
the
candle
burned
lower
and
lower
but
she
never
noticed
it
and
read
on
by
its
unsteady
light
until
she
heard
the
hall
clock
strike
four
the
candle
was
flickering
in
its
socket
and
the
june
dawn
was
beginning
to
streak
the
sky
her
eyes
smarted
and
burned
and
ached
with
a
dull
throbbing
pain
she
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
then
and
slept
so
heavily
that
she
did
not
hear
the
noises
of
the
awakening
household
once
sherman
came
to
the
door
and
peeped
in
but
finding
her
asleep
tiptoed
out
again
it
was
nearly
noon
when
she
awoke
feeling
as
tired
as
when
she
went
to
bed
she
dressed
languidly
and
went
but
was
so
unlike
her
usually
sunny
self
that
sherman
watched
her
anxiously
late
in
the
afternoon
she
sent
for
doctor
fuller
and
a
general
wail
went
up
when
he
announced
what
was
the
matter
with
her
more
measles
sherman
he
said
cheerfully
well
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
house
party
i
ever
heard
of
you
seem
to
be
exceedingly
partial
to
this
one
line
of
amusements
it
is
fair
for
betty
to
have
it
exclaimed
joyce
when
she
would
go
to
the
camp
and
she
had
it
before
it
just
too
bad
we
all
have
to
be
mighty
good
to
her
said
the
little
colonel
for
she
was
so
sweet
about
amusing
us
we
take
turns
reading
to
her
and
entertaining
her
for
she
stayed
hours
with
us
in
that
dark
room
when
she
could
have
been
outdoors
enjoying
herself
that
is
probably
the
reason
she
is
laid
up
now
answered
the
doctor
she
should
have
kept
entirely
away
from
you
but
she
had
had
one
case
explained
sherman
and
we
never
dreamed
of
her
having
another
poor
little
thing
i
hope
this
will
be
light
she
had
a
hard
time
before
so
we
must
make
a
regular
frolic
of
this
girls
well
no
madam
at
least
not
for
several
days
said
the
doctor
gravely
and
you
must
be
extremely
careful
about
her
eyes
they
seem
to
be
badly
affected
and
i
must
warn
you
that
they
are
really
in
danger
they
told
betty
that
afterward
thinking
it
would
stop
her
crying
when
everything
else
failed
to
do
so
if
she
realised
how
necessary
it
was
for
her
not
to
inflame
them
with
her
tears
usually
she
was
a
sensible
little
body
obedient
to
the
slightest
suggestion
but
now
she
lay
curled
up
in
a
disconsolate
little
heap
in
bed
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
oh
i
do
want
to
have
the
measles
she
sobbed
catching
her
breath
in
great
gasps
oh
i
do
to
my
dear
little
girl
do
let
it
distress
you
so
begged
sherman
leaning
over
and
tenderly
wiping
the
flushed
little
face
it
will
not
be
any
worse
for
you
than
for
the
other
girls
and
in
a
few
days
when
you
feel
better
we
are
going
to
have
all
sorts
of
sport
out
of
it
the
girls
are
planning
now
what
they
shall
do
to
make
up
to
you
for
this
disappointment
they
feel
as
if
they
are
to
blame
for
bringing
this
illness
upon
you
by
their
disobedience
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
bad
it
makes
them
feel
to
have
you
take
it
to
heart
so
bitterly
but
even
that
failed
to
stop
her
tears
and
presently
sherman
went
out
into
the
hall
where
the
girls
were
waiting
for
her
there
is
some
reason
for
all
this
distress
that
i
am
unable
to
discover
she
said
joyce
maybe
if
you
would
go
in
and
talk
to
her
you
might
find
out
she
must
be
lots
worse
than
we
were
whispered
eugenia
to
lloyd
as
the
high
shrill
voice
so
unlike
betty
usual
tones
went
on
complainingly
in
the
next
room
hush
warned
lloyd
she
telling
joyce
what
the
matter
is
the
words
came
out
to
them
distinctly
she
was
speaking
with
a
nervous
quickness
as
if
her
fever
had
almost
reached
delirium
i
was
trying
to
dig
one
of
those
roads
wailed
betty
in
a
high
querulous
voice
one
that
would
last
for
ever
do
you
know
like
the
one
they
built
for
tusitala
you
know
do
you
she
insisted
feverishly
but
joyce
had
to
acknowledge
that
she
had
never
heard
of
it
and
betty
cried
again
because
she
felt
too
nervous
and
ill
to
explain
there
there
never
mind
said
joyce
soothingly
thinking
that
betty
mind
was
wandering
you
can
tell
me
all
about
it
when
you
get
well
but
i
want
you
to
know
sobbed
betty
with
all
the
unreasoning
impatience
of
a
sick
child
it
is
all
in
my
times
book
i
cut
it
out
of
an
old
just
after
i
came
and
the
piece
is
inside
the
cover
of
that
little
white
and
gold
book
in
the
read
it
wo
you
then
you
will
understand
joyce
took
the
slip
of
paper
to
the
window
and
glanced
rapidly
along
the
lines
no
read
it
aloud
demanded
betty
fretfully
i
want
to
hear
it
too
it
is
such
a
sweet
story
and
i
read
it
over
every
day
to
help
me
remember
sherman
and
the
girls
sitting
outside
the
door
leaned
forward
to
listen
as
joyce
read
aloud
the
newspaper
clipping
that
betty
counted
among
her
chief
treasures
this
is
what
they
heard
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
remembering
the
great
love
of
his
highness
tusitala
and
his
loving
care
when
we
were
in
prison
and
sore
distressed
we
have
prepared
him
an
enduring
present
this
road
which
we
have
dug
for
ever
in
a
island
thousands
of
miles
from
the
mainland
and
unconnected
with
the
world
by
cable
stands
this
inscription
it
was
set
up
at
the
corner
of
a
new
road
cut
through
a
tropical
jungle
and
bears
at
its
head
the
title
of
this
article
signed
by
the
names
of
ten
prominent
chiefs
this
is
the
story
of
the
road
and
why
it
was
built
some
years
ago
a
scotchman
broken
in
health
and
expecting
an
early
death
sought
out
this
lonely
spot
because
here
the
climate
was
favourable
to
the
disease
from
which
he
suffered
he
settled
here
for
what
remained
to
him
of
life
he
bought
an
estate
of
several
hundred
acres
and
threw
himself
earnestly
into
the
life
of
the
natives
of
the
island
there
was
great
division
among
the
many
chiefs
and
prolonged
warfare
very
soon
the
chiefs
found
that
this
alien
from
a
strange
land
was
their
best
friend
they
began
coming
to
him
for
counsel
and
invited
him
to
their
most
important
conferences
though
he
did
not
bear
that
name
he
became
a
missionary
to
them
he
was
their
hero
and
they
loved
and
trusted
him
because
he
tried
to
lead
them
aright
they
had
never
had
such
a
friend
and
so
it
came
about
that
when
the
wars
ceased
the
chiefs
of
both
sides
called
him
by
a
name
of
their
own
and
made
him
one
of
their
own
number
thus
conferring
upon
him
the
highest
honour
within
their
power
but
many
of
the
chiefs
were
still
in
prison
because
of
their
political
views
or
deeds
and
in
constant
danger
of
being
put
to
death
their
sole
friend
was
the
scotchman
whom
they
called
tusitala
he
visited
them
comforted
them
repeated
passages
from
the
history
of
christ
to
them
and
busied
himself
incessantly
to
effect
their
release
at
length
he
obtained
their
freedom
and
then
glowing
with
gratitude
in
despite
of
age
decrepitude
and
loss
of
strength
they
started
directly
for
the
estate
of
their
benefactor
and
there
in
the
terrible
heat
they
laboured
for
weeks
in
building
him
a
road
which
they
knew
he
had
long
desired
love
conquered
weakness
and
they
did
not
cease
their
toil
until
their
handiwork
which
they
called
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
was
finished
not
long
after
this
the
white
chief
suddenly
died
at
the
news
the
native
chiefs
flocked
from
all
parts
of
the
island
to
the
house
and
took
charge
of
the
body
they
kissed
his
hand
as
they
came
in
and
all
night
sat
in
silence
about
him
one
of
them
a
feeble
old
man
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
the
body
of
his
benefactor
and
cried
out
between
his
sobs
i
am
only
a
poor
black
man
and
ignorant
yet
i
am
not
afraid
to
come
and
take
the
last
look
of
my
dead
friend
face
behold
tusitala
is
dead
we
were
in
prison
and
he
cared
for
us
the
day
was
no
longer
than
his
kindness
who
is
there
so
great
as
tusitala
who
is
there
more
what
is
your
love
to
his
love
so
the
chiefs
took
their
friend
to
the
top
of
a
steep
mountain
which
he
had
loved
and
there
buried
him
it
was
a
mighty
task
the
civilised
world
mourns
the
great
author
the
name
of
robert
louis
stevenson
is
lastingly
inwrought
into
english
literature
but
the
samoans
mourn
in
his
loss
a
brother
who
outdid
all
others
in
and
so
long
as
the
island
in
the
pacific
exists
tusitala
will
be
gratefully
remembered
not
because
he
was
so
greatly
gifted
but
because
he
was
a
good
man
the
phrase
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
is
a
gospel
in
itself
the
day
is
not
longer
than
his
kindness
is
a
new
beatitude
fame
dies
and
honours
perish
but
is
immortal
footnotes
footnote
editorial
in
old
copy
of
joyce
finished
and
looked
up
inquiringly
she
still
did
not
see
what
connection
the
road
could
have
with
betty
distress
over
the
measles
now
do
you
see
asked
betty
tremulously
it
is
for
godmother
that
i
wanted
to
build
that
road
for
ever
since
i
came
she
has
been
like
tusitala
to
me
day
is
no
longer
than
her
kindness
oh
joyce
nobody
knows
how
good
she
has
been
to
me
then
between
her
sobs
she
told
joyce
again
the
story
of
the
gold
beads
and
the
many
things
her
godmother
had
done
to
make
her
visit
a
continual
delight
sherman
outside
the
door
felt
her
eyes
grow
dim
and
her
cheeks
wet
as
the
child
babbled
on
reciting
a
long
list
of
little
kindnesses
that
she
had
treasured
in
her
memory
and
that
her
godmother
had
either
done
unconsciously
or
had
forgotten
long
ago
it
showed
how
hungry
the
poor
little
heart
had
been
that
such
trifles
could
make
it
brim
over
with
gratitude
she
wiped
her
eyes
more
than
once
as
the
voice
went
on
of
course
i
could
dig
a
road
like
those
chiefs
did
and
she
have
wanted
one
even
if
i
could
but
i
thought
maybe
i
could
leave
a
memory
behind
me
when
this
beautiful
visit
is
done
that
would
be
like
a
smooth
white
road
you
know
remembering
things
is
like
looking
back
over
a
road
at
least
it
always
seemed
that
way
to
me
and
the
unpleasant
things
that
have
happened
are
like
the
stones
and
rocks
that
we
stumble
over
but
if
there
have
been
any
unpleasant
things
to
remember
then
we
can
look
back
and
see
it
stretched
out
behind
us
all
smooth
and
white
and
shining
so
i
tried
from
the
very
first
of
my
visit
to
leave
nothing
behind
me
for
her
memory
to
stumble
over
not
a
frown
a
cross
word
or
a
single
disobedience
that
why
i
would
go
with
you
that
day
to
have
my
fortune
told
it
would
have
spoiled
my
of
the
loving
heart
and
put
a
stone
in
it
that
would
always
have
made
godmother
sorry
when
she
thought
of
my
visit
that
why
i
came
back
from
the
picnic
at
the
old
mill
and
missed
the
charades
it
would
have
spoiled
the
road
if
i
had
kept
my
promise
kept
it
to
the
utmost
and
now
after
all
the
days
i
have
tried
so
hard
it
is
going
to
be
spoiled
because
i
gone
and
got
sick
be
so
much
care
and
trouble
that
the
memory
road
will
be
all
spoiled
my
of
the
loving
heart
betty
was
so
exhausted
by
this
time
that
she
was
not
crying
any
longer
but
now
and
then
a
long
sob
shook
the
little
body
from
head
to
foot
joyce
not
knowing
what
to
say
slipped
away
and
went
out
into
the
hall
so
that
is
the
cause
of
the
child
distress
whispered
sherman
bless
her
little
heart
now
i
found
out
what
is
the
matter
maybe
i
can
succeed
in
quieting
her
what
she
said
to
comfort
her
the
girls
never
knew
for
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
they
stole
away
to
their
own
rooms
but
presently
they
heard
the
white
seal
lullaby
sung
softly
within
she
had
taken
betty
in
her
arms
and
was
rocking
her
as
tenderly
as
she
had
rocked
the
little
colonel
while
she
sang
oh
hush
thee
my
baby
the
night
is
behind
us
when
betty
fell
asleep
it
was
in
the
embrace
of
something
far
more
comforting
and
restful
than
the
arms
of
the
seas
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
since
she
could
remember
she
felt
what
it
was
to
be
folded
fast
in
the
that
she
had
always
longed
for
chapter
xiv
a
long
night
oh
is
it
awful
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
in
a
shocked
tone
and
with
such
a
look
of
horror
in
her
face
that
eugenia
leaned
forward
to
listen
lloyd
was
speaking
to
joyce
on
the
porch
just
outside
of
the
library
window
where
eugenia
sat
reading
what
is
awful
asked
eugenia
her
curiosity
aroused
by
the
expression
of
the
girls
faces
sh
whispered
lloyd
warningly
as
she
tiptoed
to
the
window
and
sat
down
on
the
broad
low
sill
i
am
afraid
betty
will
hear
us
talking
about
her
the
doctor
has
just
been
here
and
he
says
oh
eugenia
it
is
too
terrible
to
tell
he
says
he
is
afraid
that
betty
is
going
the
tears
stood
in
the
little
colonel
eyes
you
know
that
people
do
lose
their
sight
sometimes
when
they
have
the
measles
and
her
eyes
have
been
the
worst
part
of
it
from
the
start
the
night
before
the
measles
broke
out
on
her
she
read
till
nearly
morning
by
because
she
was
restless
and
could
go
to
sleep
of
course
that
made
them
worse
echoed
eugenia
closing
her
own
eyes
a
moment
on
the
bright
summer
world
without
and
feeling
a
chill
run
over
her
as
she
realised
what
black
dungeon
walls
those
five
letters
could
build
around
a
life
was
the
doctor
sure
lloyd
ca
something
be
done
of
he
was
i
heard
him
tell
mothah
that
he
give
up
fighting
for
her
sight
as
long
as
there
was
a
shadow
of
a
chance
to
save
it
but
he
advised
her
to
send
for
an
oculist
to
consult
with
him
and
she
just
now
telephoned
to
the
city
for
one
does
betty
know
it
she
knows
that
there
is
dangah
of
her
losing
her
sight
and
is
so
hahd
to
be
quiet
and
patient
eugenia
laid
down
her
book
feeling
faint
and
sick
for
a
long
time
after
lloyd
and
joyce
had
left
her
she
sat
idly
playing
with
the
curtain
cord
thinking
over
what
they
had
told
her
presently
she
tiptoed
to
her
room
she
stood
a
moment
outside
betty
door
listening
for
betty
was
talking
to
eliot
and
she
wanted
to
hear
what
a
person
with
such
a
prospect
staring
her
in
the
face
would
have
to
say
there
are
lots
of
beautiful
things
in
the
world
to
think
about
eliot
betty
was
saying
bravely
in
her
sweet
cheery
little
voice
when
you
lived
in
the
country
and
have
all
the
big
outdoors
to
remember
now
while
i
so
hot
i
love
to
count
up
all
the
cool
things
i
can
remember
i
like
to
pretend
that
i
down
in
the
orchard
way
early
in
the
morning
with
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
through
the
and
the
dewdrops
shining
on
every
blade
of
grass
oh
it
smells
so
fresh
and
sweet
and
delicious
now
i
in
the
and
the
tall
green
corn
is
rustling
in
the
wind
and
the
climb
up
every
stalk
and
shake
the
dew
out
of
their
purple
bells
now
i
can
hear
the
bucket
splash
down
in
the
well
and
come
up
cold
and
dripping
and
now
i
dabbling
my
fingers
in
the
spring
down
in
the
old
stone
spring
house
and
standing
on
the
cold
wet
rocks
in
my
bare
feet
and
there
the
winter
mornings
eliot
when
the
trees
are
covered
with
sleet
till
every
twig
twinkles
like
a
diamond
and
the
frost
on
the
oh
if
i
could
only
lay
my
face
against
the
cold
glass
now
how
good
it
would
feel
eugenia
could
bear
no
more
she
turned
away
from
the
door
and
meeting
sherman
on
the
threshold
of
her
room
threw
herself
into
her
arms
sobbing
oh
cousin
elizabeth
i
ca
stand
it
if
betty
goes
blind
it
will
be
all
my
fault
she
never
would
have
had
the
measles
if
it
had
been
for
me
but
i
would
go
and
i
made
the
others
go
too
and
when
betty
refused
i
was
so
mean
and
hateful
to
her
oh
cousin
elizabeth
what
can
i
do
sherman
drew
eugenia
into
her
room
and
comforted
her
the
best
she
could
but
her
own
heart
was
heavy
she
knew
that
doctor
fuller
had
little
hope
of
saving
betty
sight
that
knowledge
threw
a
shadow
over
the
entire
household
the
great
oculist
came
and
gravely
shook
his
head
over
the
case
there
is
one
chance
that
she
may
see
again
he
said
one
in
a
hundred
that
is
all
now
if
she
could
have
a
trained
nurse
who
could
watch
her
eyes
constantly
and
follow
directions
to
the
letter
she
shall
have
anything
interrupted
sherman
everything
that
would
help
in
the
smallest
degree
and
it
would
be
best
not
to
let
the
child
know
he
continued
it
would
probably
excite
her
and
above
all
things
that
must
be
guarded
against
but
betty
lying
with
bandaged
eyes
caught
a
whisper
felt
the
suppressed
sympathy
in
the
atmosphere
as
one
feels
the
tingle
of
electricity
in
the
air
before
a
storm
and
began
to
guess
the
truth
when
the
trained
nurse
came
and
gave
such
careful
attention
to
the
treatment
of
her
eyes
she
was
sure
of
it
but
she
said
nothing
of
her
suspicions
and
they
thought
she
had
none
one
day
lloyd
came
into
the
room
with
a
newspaper
in
her
hand
eugenia
and
joyce
followed
softly
lloyd
tried
to
speak
calmly
but
there
was
a
suppressed
excitement
in
her
voice
as
she
exclaimed
betty
i
got
the
loveliest
thing
to
show
you
mothah
said
i
might
be
the
one
to
tell
i
so
glad
and
proud
i
do
know
what
to
do
you
know
that
little
poem
that
you
gave
to
mothah
called
well
she
sent
it
away
to
an
editah
and
he
has
published
it
in
this
papah
with
yo
name
at
the
bottom
elizabeth
lloyd
lewis
now
are
you
stuck
up
we
are
all
so
proud
of
you
we
do
know
what
to
do
betty
stretched
out
one
trembling
hand
for
the
paper
and
involuntarily
the
other
went
up
to
her
eyes
to
push
away
the
bandages
let
me
see
it
she
cried
eagerly
but
the
thrill
of
gladness
in
her
voice
died
in
a
pitiful
little
note
of
despair
as
she
whispered
brokenly
oh
i
forgot
i
ca
see
but
the
next
instant
her
hand
was
groping
for
the
paper
again
where
is
it
she
asked
let
me
feel
it
anyway
oh
to
think
that
something
i
have
written
has
really
been
published
where
is
it
lloyd
put
my
hand
on
the
spot
please
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
how
glad
and
thankful
i
have
always
wanted
to
write
always
hoped
that
some
day
after
i
had
tried
years
and
years
i
might
be
able
to
do
something
good
enough
to
be
published
but
to
have
it
come
now
while
i
am
a
little
girl
her
voice
sunk
almost
to
a
whisper
oh
lloyd
you
do
know
how
wonderful
it
seems
to
me
she
was
trembling
so
that
the
paper
shook
in
her
hands
where
is
it
she
asked
again
feeling
blindly
over
the
page
there
said
lloyd
placing
the
little
groping
finger
on
a
spot
at
the
head
of
a
column
there
is
the
word
and
heah
guiding
her
fingers
down
the
page
heah
is
yo
name
if
i
were
you
i
be
so
stuck
up
i
would
speak
to
common
people
that
ca
have
verses
published
in
the
papah
but
oh
if
you
could
it
betty
words
came
in
choking
little
gasps
she
paused
a
moment
and
turned
her
face
away
swallowing
hard
then
she
went
on
more
calmly
was
it
queer
that
i
should
have
written
about
night
just
before
mine
begun
that
the
only
thing
i
shall
ever
have
published
should
be
called
that
my
long
long
night
but
there
are
no
stars
in
this
night
lloyd
it
awful
to
think
you
always
be
in
the
dark
lloyd
turned
with
a
startled
glance
to
the
other
girls
i
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
stammered
yes
you
do
insisted
betty
what
you
been
trying
to
keep
from
me
all
of
you
that
i
am
always
going
to
be
she
ended
the
sentence
with
a
little
shiver
and
choking
with
sobs
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
at
a
sign
from
the
nurse
lloyd
slipped
away
and
ran
to
her
mother
room
she
found
eugenia
already
there
with
her
head
buried
in
sherman
lap
oh
it
almost
broke
my
heart
she
was
saying
to
see
those
poor
little
fingers
groping
over
the
paper
feeling
for
the
poem
that
she
could
see
and
she
said
so
pitifully
long
long
night
there
are
no
stars
in
this
night
and
to
think
it
all
my
fault
oh
it
is
just
killing
me
i
could
hardly
sleep
last
night
for
thinking
of
it
and
when
i
did
i
had
a
dreadful
nightmare
i
dreamed
that
i
was
in
a
great
going
from
stall
to
stall
trying
to
buy
something
but
i
had
forgotten
what
it
was
i
wanted
a
horrid
grinning
little
dwarf
with
great
fangs
in
his
jaw
like
a
tusks
followed
me
everywhere
carrying
my
purse
i
stand
awhile
in
front
of
every
stall
trying
to
remember
what
it
was
i
come
for
and
when
i
thought
awhile
i
cry
out
i
know
what
i
want
give
me
my
own
way
it
is
my
own
way
that
i
want
everybody
in
the
market
would
stop
to
listen
and
the
man
behind
the
counter
would
say
unless
you
can
pay
the
price
then
that
horrible
dwarf
would
step
up
grinning
his
old
tusks
showing
all
hideous
and
yellow
and
say
is
the
price
give
her
her
own
way
here
is
the
price
let
the
whole
world
see
the
price
that
she
has
paid
for
her
own
way
betty
eyes
is
the
price
betty
beautiful
brown
eyes
and
then
he
would
hold
them
out
in
his
ugly
knotted
hand
and
they
would
look
up
at
me
so
reproachfully
that
i
would
scream
and
tear
my
hair
i
do
know
how
many
times
i
had
to
go
through
that
scene
in
my
sleep
but
when
i
got
up
this
morning
i
was
as
tired
as
if
i
had
been
running
all
night
and
every
place
i
turn
i
can
see
that
hideous
old
hand
thrust
out
at
me
with
betty
brown
eyes
in
it
i
never
insist
on
having
my
own
way
again
there
was
no
time
for
sherman
to
comfort
eugenia
then
for
betty
needed
her
and
in
answer
to
the
nurse
summons
she
hurried
away
to
soothe
the
child
sorely
distressed
by
this
turn
that
the
house
party
had
taken
go
out
on
the
ponies
for
awhile
she
said
as
she
left
the
three
girls
sitting
disconsolately
on
the
floor
go
out
and
get
some
of
this
summer
sunshine
into
your
faces
and
voices
so
that
you
can
bring
it
back
to
elizabeth
she
will
need
all
that
you
can
bring
her
poor
child
so
instead
of
brooding
over
your
own
feelings
think
of
something
that
you
can
do
to
cheer
her
up
in
a
little
while
there
was
a
clatter
of
ponies
hoofs
down
the
avenue
and
sherman
sitting
by
the
window
in
betty
room
waved
her
hand
to
eugenia
joyce
and
the
little
colonel
as
they
rode
away
they
were
gone
all
morning
and
when
they
came
back
the
june
sunshine
had
done
its
work
their
faces
were
bright
and
smiling
and
they
giggled
continuously
as
they
bumped
into
each
other
running
up
the
stairs
betty
door
was
open
and
to
their
surprise
they
heard
a
little
laugh
as
they
stopped
to
peep
in
she
was
lying
back
among
the
pillows
with
bandaged
eyes
but
there
was
a
smile
on
her
lips
come
in
girls
she
cried
godmother
and
i
are
making
alphabet
rhymes
we
started
at
a
and
have
been
taking
turns
she
has
just
made
a
good
one
is
a
portly
and
proud
pugnaciously
prattling
what
the
rest
of
it
godmother
you
tell
them
i
have
forgotten
but
sherman
rhyme
was
broken
short
in
an
astonished
exclamation
as
her
glance
fell
on
the
little
colonel
why
lloyd
sherman
she
cried
what
have
you
been
doing
your
dress
is
torn
to
tatters
and
you
are
so
dirty
and
dusty
that
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
you
are
my
child
the
little
colonel
screwed
herself
around
to
look
at
the
back
of
her
which
was
torn
into
a
dozen
ragged
strips
and
fluttered
behind
her
in
long
fringes
there
was
a
tear
on
the
shoulder
and
a
hole
in
the
elbow
of
her
sleeve
reckon
i
must
have
toah
it
gettin
through
a
bobwiah
fence
she
answered
cheerfully
but
look
at
eugenia
she
as
much
of
a
sight
as
i
am
with
her
hair
hangin
all
in
her
eyes
like
an
ole
witch
and
that
scratch
across
her
face
and
her
stockings
full
of
burrs
joyce
is
nearly
as
bad
cried
eugenia
both
hair
ribbons
gone
the
heel
lost
off
one
shoe
grass
stains
on
her
dress
and
her
face
red
as
a
turkey
gobbler
from
running
so
fast
where
you
all
been
and
what
have
you
been
doing
demanded
sherman
so
emphatically
that
with
much
giggling
and
exclaiming
they
all
began
to
talk
at
once
we
met
the
boys
ovah
on
the
pike
began
the
little
colonel
malcolm
and
keith
and
robby
and
we
were
all
ridin
along
as
polite
as
anything
when
the
boys
began
to
tell
about
the
good
times
they
used
to
have
playin
indian
but
first
interrupted
joyce
keith
told
about
the
time
they
tied
his
little
cousin
ginger
to
a
tree
in
the
woods
and
left
her
there
until
it
was
so
dark
she
nearly
had
a
spasm
yes
said
eugenia
and
i
said
what
a
pity
it
was
that
we
were
too
old
to
play
indian
that
i
had
had
the
blues
all
day
and
felt
that
nothing
would
do
me
so
much
good
as
to
get
out
some
place
where
nobody
could
hear
and
yell
and
carry
on
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
malcolm
said
that
just
for
once
supposing
we
pretend
like
we
were
ten
years
old
instead
of
thirteen
and
pitch
in
and
have
a
good
ripping
tearing
old
game
of
indian
it
was
away
up
the
pike
where
there
was
nothing
in
sight
but
a
few
farmhouses
scattered
along
the
road
and
it
seem
as
if
it
would
make
any
difference
so
we
said
we
would
first
thing
i
knew
broke
in
joyce
robby
moore
gave
an
outlandish
right
in
my
ear
that
nearly
deafened
me
and
grabbed
me
by
my
hair
yelling
he
was
going
to
tomahawk
me
and
i
saw
eugenia
go
sailing
up
the
road
as
fast
as
her
horse
could
carry
her
with
keith
after
her
swinging
on
to
those
two
long
black
braids
of
hers
you
see
lloyd
had
the
advantage
of
us
with
her
short
hair
they
could
scalp
her
so
easily
but
malcolm
chased
after
her
like
all
possessed
maybe
you
think
it
was
excitin
said
the
little
colonel
i
felt
like
a
real
suah
indian
was
aftah
me
and
i
screeched
bloody
murdah
till
you
could
have
heard
me
almost
to
the
old
mill
i
should
say
she
did
giggled
joyce
the
way
tarbaby
got
over
the
ground
was
something
to
remember
and
the
way
lloyd
yelled
would
have
made
a
wild
coyote
take
to
its
heels
just
as
we
got
in
sight
of
the
we
met
one
of
those
big
full
of
chickens
and
ducks
and
things
you
know
how
funny
they
always
look
with
so
many
bills
and
legs
and
tails
sticking
through
the
slats
well
the
horses
shied
as
we
went
dashing
up
to
them
and
first
thing
we
knew
they
had
backed
that
wagon
into
a
ditch
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
one
of
the
coops
went
off
the
top
into
the
ditch
you
never
saw
anything
madder
than
that
old
huckster
interrupted
eugenia
he
jumped
down
off
the
wagon
and
came
up
to
us
with
a
big
whip
in
his
hands
scolding
as
cross
as
two
sticks
but
he
stay
angry
with
those
boys
they
were
so
polite
and
apologised
and
said
if
they
had
done
anything
wrong
they
wanted
to
make
it
right
they
offered
to
pay
for
the
coop
if
it
was
broken
and
got
off
their
horses
to
help
him
lift
it
on
to
the
wagon
again
but
when
they
took
hold
of
it
three
chickens
flopped
out
of
the
broken
side
and
went
squawking
across
the
fields
it
was
funny
laughed
lloyd
there
they
went
legs
stretching
wings
flapping
lickety
split
it
made
me
think
of
papa
jack
story
about
the
old
witch
ran
she
flew
she
ran
she
flew
we
all
told
the
old
huckstah
we
help
him
catch
them
and
that
why
we
got
so
dirty
illustration
we
caught
the
chickens
and
brought
them
back
oh
such
a
chase
added
joyce
through
fences
over
ploughed
fields
and
into
blackberry
briers
that
is
how
we
got
so
scratched
and
torn
but
we
caught
the
chickens
and
brought
them
back
with
feathers
flying
and
with
them
squawking
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
what
fun
it
must
have
been
said
betty
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
you
then
and
i
wish
i
could
see
you
now
you
must
be
wrecks
they
are
not
pretty
sights
i
can
assure
you
said
sherman
laughing
in
spite
of
her
disapproval
i
astonished
that
you
would
make
such
a
commotion
on
a
public
road
and
i
afraid
i
would
have
to
lecture
you
a
little
if
i
were
not
sure
that
you
would
never
do
it
again
run
along
now
and
make
yourselves
presentable
for
lunch
and
first
thing
you
do
look
in
your
mirrors
you
not
be
charmed
sure
one
little
two
little
three
little
indians
sang
betty
as
they
skipped
out
of
the
room
hand
in
hand
and
joyce
whispered
in
the
hall
how
can
she
be
so
cheerful
she
the
bravest
little
thing
i
ever
saw
they
learned
the
secret
of
her
cheerfulness
next
time
they
went
to
her
room
she
turned
to
them
with
a
wistful
little
smile
sadder
somehow
than
tears
saying
godmother
has
helped
me
to
find
some
stars
in
my
long
night
girls
she
told
me
about
milton
i
did
know
before
that
he
was
blind
when
he
wrote
lost
and
she
told
me
about
fanny
crosby
too
the
blind
hymnwriter
whose
hymns
have
helped
so
many
people
and
are
sung
all
over
the
world
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
the
doctor
ca
save
my
sight
i
do
as
they
did
it
like
dropping
the
curtains
on
the
outside
darkness
when
night
comes
on
godmother
says
and
turning
up
the
lights
and
stirring
the
fire
and
making
it
so
bright
and
cheerful
and
sweet
inside
that
you
forget
how
dark
it
is
outdoors
and
maybe
if
i
can
do
that
and
think
all
the
time
about
the
beautiful
things
i
have
seen
and
read
i
can
make
up
stories
some
day
as
they
did
their
poems
and
hymns
i
will
write
fairy
tales
that
the
children
will
love
to
listen
to
and
ask
to
hear
over
and
over
again
i
know
i
can
do
it
for
the
ones
i
made
for
davy
he
likes
best
of
all
i
never
hope
to
write
stories
that
grown
people
would
be
interested
in
and
love
as
they
love
tusitala
but
just
to
be
the
children
and
to
write
stories
that
they
would
listen
to
long
after
i
am
dead
and
gone
why
would
be
worth
living
for
even
if
i
never
saw
the
light
again
and
godmother
thinks
i
can
do
it
i
know
you
can
assented
lloyd
warmly
and
we
copy
them
for
you
and
send
them
away
to
be
put
into
books
joyce
asked
betty
would
you
mind
reading
that
little
newspaper
clipping
to
the
girls
about
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
i
want
them
to
know
about
it
too
she
did
not
know
that
they
had
already
heard
it
listening
outside
her
door
with
heavy
hearts
and
troubled
faces
and
when
joyce
had
found
it
and
again
read
it
aloud
she
told
them
the
story
of
the
memory
road
that
she
was
trying
to
leave
behind
her
it
will
be
harder
to
do
now
that
i
am
blind
she
said
at
the
last
for
i
ca
help
being
a
care
and
a
trouble
to
everybody
everywhere
i
go
now
but
godmother
says
people
wo
mind
that
much
if
i
only
be
pleasant
and
cheerful
about
my
misfortune
and
not
let
it
cast
its
shadow
on
other
lives
any
more
than
i
can
help
i
have
said
anything
about
it
yet
to
her
but
if
there
is
enough
money
in
the
bank
that
papa
left
to
educate
me
with
i
want
to
go
to
a
school
for
the
blind
and
learn
to
read
those
queer
raised
letters
and
to
do
everything
for
myself
then
i
not
be
such
a
trouble
to
everybody
but
how
can
you
be
cheerful
and
pleasant
and
go
on
that
way
for
a
whole
lifetime
asked
eugenia
with
a
shiver
you
may
live
to
be
an
old
old
woman
oh
eugenia
exclaimed
joyce
in
a
shocked
undertone
do
remind
the
poor
little
thing
of
of
that
i
know
answered
betty
her
smile
all
gone
now
and
her
lip
trembling
sometimes
when
i
think
of
that
it
so
awful
that
i
can
hardly
stand
it
but
it
will
be
only
a
day
at
a
time
and
if
i
can
manage
to
get
through
them
one
by
one
and
keep
my
courage
up
to
the
end
it
will
be
all
right
afterward
you
know
for
there
is
no
night
the
nurse
read
me
that
yesterday
out
of
revelation
that
the
only
thing
that
comforts
me
sometimes
she
repeated
it
in
a
soft
whisper
turning
her
face
away
there
be
night
chapter
xv
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
joyce
sat
with
her
elbows
on
her
and
her
chin
in
her
hands
gazing
thoughtfully
into
the
mirror
she
had
just
come
from
betty
room
and
the
child
patient
cheerfulness
in
the
face
of
the
dark
future
that
threatened
her
had
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
dear
little
betty
she
said
to
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
what
a
beautiful
memory
of
her
we
will
all
carry
away
with
us
there
is
a
single
thing
i
would
want
to
forget
about
her
she
will
be
leaving
each
one
of
us
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
to
look
back
on
and
it
like
the
work
of
the
old
samoan
chiefs
too
built
to
last
for
ever
it
frightens
me
to
think
that
what
i
done
is
going
to
be
remembered
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
but
that
is
what
sherman
said
memories
we
dig
into
our
souls
will
go
with
us
into
if
i
should
die
right
now
what
a
lot
of
things
i
would
want
people
to
forget
about
me
especially
the
family
i
been
so
mean
to
jack
and
so
selfish
with
mary
i
going
to
begin
the
minute
i
get
back
to
the
little
brown
house
to
start
to
make
a
memory
road
for
everybody
that
i
need
not
be
ashamed
of
when
i
lie
then
she
gave
a
shamefaced
little
glance
at
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
no
that
putting
it
off
too
long
that
is
one
of
my
worst
habits
i
begin
this
minute
and
write
that
letter
to
mamma
that
i
have
been
putting
off
all
week
and
i
take
time
to
make
it
interesting
and
write
all
the
little
things
that
i
know
she
wants
to
hear
about
and
i
not
be
so
snappish
with
eugenia
and
make
her
feel
that
she
was
most
to
blame
about
our
getting
the
measles
i
taken
a
mean
sort
of
pleasure
in
doing
it
before
poor
thing
she
seems
to
feel
dreadfully
bad
about
it
and
there
no
use
my
adding
anything
to
her
distress
and
joyce
jumping
up
took
out
her
writing
materials
and
sat
down
at
her
desk
at
the
same
moment
the
little
colonel
was
hanging
around
the
door
waiting
for
sherman
who
sat
in
the
room
until
betty
fell
asleep
there
was
a
lingering
tenderness
in
lloyd
kiss
as
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
mother
neck
and
though
no
word
was
spoken
sherman
knew
that
lloyd
had
taken
betty
little
sermon
to
heart
where
is
eugenia
dear
she
asked
she
has
gone
to
her
room
i
think
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
her
she
has
seemed
so
miserable
and
unhappy
since
all
this
happened
the
poor
child
has
nearly
made
herself
ill
worrying
about
it
across
the
hall
eugenia
had
thrown
herself
down
on
her
bed
and
was
staring
out
of
the
windows
she
saw
nothing
of
the
summer
skies
outside
or
any
of
all
that
outdoor
brightness
her
gaze
was
turned
inward
on
herself
i
wish
i
could
begin
at
the
beginning
and
do
it
all
over
all
my
life
she
thought
somehow
i
always
thought
it
rather
smart
to
say
and
do
exactly
as
i
pleased
to
be
the
ringleader
in
all
the
mischief
and
make
the
teachers
dread
me
and
have
the
girls
afraid
of
me
but
betty
makes
you
look
at
things
so
differently
i
give
anything
got
to
have
people
remember
me
as
they
will
her
what
must
papa
think
of
me
i
all
he
got
and
he
is
so
good
to
me
oh
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
never
been
born
every
day
i
lived
i
left
a
whole
road
full
of
stones
for
somebody
to
jolt
over
poor
old
eliot
think
of
me
as
anything
else
than
an
imp
of
selfishness
for
i
always
making
it
hard
for
her
and
she
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
she
has
feelings
as
well
as
i
have
even
if
she
is
a
servant
and
now
betty
eyes
she
turned
over
on
the
bed
face
downward
and
began
to
cry
it
was
just
then
that
sherman
tapped
at
the
door
for
almost
an
hour
lloyd
could
hear
the
low
murmur
of
voices
going
on
inside
the
room
and
knew
that
eugenia
was
hearing
now
what
she
had
always
most
sorely
needed
a
sympathetic
motherly
talk
if
she
could
have
had
that
loving
advice
those
straightforward
words
of
warning
long
ago
how
much
they
might
have
done
for
the
motherless
child
as
it
was
that
hour
opened
eugenia
eyes
to
many
things
and
awakened
a
desire
to
grow
more
like
the
gentle
woman
beside
her
sweet
and
sincere
unselfish
and
helpful
great
was
forbes
surprise
one
day
when
he
opened
a
letter
from
eugenia
in
the
at
the
waldorf
to
find
that
it
covered
eight
pages
and
was
blistered
in
several
places
as
if
she
had
dropped
a
tear
or
two
as
she
wrote
usually
she
had
a
favour
to
ask
when
she
wrote
and
scrawled
only
a
page
or
two
but
this
told
the
story
of
blindness
her
own
part
in
the
affair
and
all
that
she
had
learned
about
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
the
newspaper
clipping
that
betty
had
treasured
was
enclosed
that
he
might
read
for
himself
the
story
of
tusitala
that
had
left
such
an
impression
on
her
the
letter
touched
him
as
nothing
had
done
for
years
and
he
read
it
a
second
time
while
he
was
going
up
to
his
office
on
the
elevated
then
at
while
he
waited
in
his
for
lunch
to
be
served
he
took
it
out
and
read
it
again
all
that
busy
day
between
the
demands
that
business
made
on
him
and
once
even
in
the
midst
of
dictating
to
his
typewriter
his
thoughts
kept
turning
to
that
island
in
the
southern
seas
where
tusitala
road
gleams
white
under
the
tropic
sun
he
had
met
robert
louis
stevenson
once
the
of
story
and
he
well
understood
the
influence
of
that
noble
life
over
the
old
chiefs
who
called
him
brother
the
words
that
eugenia
had
quoted
in
her
letter
rang
in
his
ears
all
day
every
way
he
turned
dies
and
honours
perish
but
is
he
seemed
to
hear
them
when
a
poor
woman
came
into
his
office
asking
for
a
position
for
her
son
they
stopped
the
curt
refusal
on
his
lips
and
caused
him
to
take
half
an
hour
of
his
precious
time
to
help
her
he
heard
them
again
when
a
case
was
reported
to
him
of
a
man
living
in
one
of
his
who
could
not
pay
his
rent
because
he
was
too
ill
to
work
and
could
not
hope
to
recover
in
his
present
surroundings
the
stifling
heat
of
the
crowded
tenement
was
killing
him
in
his
weakened
condition
he
was
slowly
sinking
under
his
burden
of
debt
and
worry
and
the
thought
that
his
helpless
family
was
almost
starving
and
would
be
left
uncared
for
when
he
died
forbes
turned
away
with
an
impatient
frown
from
his
report
but
that
voice
from
far
samoa
seemed
to
speak
again
it
was
tusitala
and
again
he
saw
the
road
dug
to
last
for
ever
in
the
white
light
of
the
tropic
skies
he
sat
with
his
head
on
his
hand
a
moment
and
then
slowly
reaching
for
his
filled
out
a
blank
signed
it
and
sealed
it
in
an
envelope
pushing
it
toward
his
astonished
collector
he
said
here
miller
take
that
down
to
wiggins
and
tell
him
i
said
to
pick
up
himself
and
family
and
go
down
to
the
seashore
for
a
couple
of
weeks
it
will
put
them
all
on
their
feet
again
to
get
out
of
that
place
into
the
salt
air
and
wait
a
minute
miller
as
the
collector
moved
off
take
him
a
receipt
for
two
months
rent
miller
walked
away
speechless
with
astonishment
but
he
had
found
his
tongue
by
the
time
he
got
back
he
went
into
the
private
office
hat
in
hand
and
waited
patiently
until
forbes
looked
up
well
wiggins
says
to
tell
you
sir
that
he
will
write
to
you
but
if
you
excuse
me
sir
for
meddling
in
what
is
none
of
my
business
i
like
you
to
know
before
then
what
a
little
heaven
on
earth
you
have
made
in
that
wiggins
was
so
weak
he
could
hardly
sit
up
and
he
cried
for
pure
joy
at
the
thought
of
getting
away
he
says
he
knows
it
will
save
his
life
he
kept
wringing
my
hand
over
and
over
and
saying
is
just
the
money
and
all
that
it
will
do
for
me
in
the
way
of
unloading
me
of
that
debt
and
getting
my
strength
back
but
it
the
kindness
of
it
miller
the
heavenly
kindness
of
it
doing
all
this
for
me
as
if
he
had
been
my
brother
thank
you
miller
said
forbes
waving
him
hastily
aside
and
turning
again
to
his
letters
he
seemed
impatient
but
there
was
a
glow
in
his
heart
that
made
the
world
seem
pleasanter
all
day
on
his
way
home
he
stopped
at
a
jeweller
and
selected
a
little
ring
it
was
only
a
simple
twist
of
gold
tied
in
a
lover
knot
but
inside
he
had
them
engrave
the
word
tusitala
and
ordered
it
sent
to
the
hotel
that
evening
late
that
night
it
was
brought
up
to
his
room
where
he
sat
writing
a
letter
to
eugenia
he
had
just
finished
the
paragraph
i
am
sending
you
by
this
mail
a
sort
of
talisman
maybe
the
daily
sight
of
it
on
your
finger
will
be
a
helpful
reminder
of
that
noble
life
that
shall
never
be
forgotten
while
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
endures
it
is
so
easy
to
forget
to
take
time
to
be
kind
i
find
it
so
in
my
daily
rush
of
business
i
shall
carry
your
letter
with
me
as
a
reminder
tell
your
little
friend
betty
so
the
ripple
she
started
will
circle
farther
than
she
ever
dreamed
how
queer
for
me
to
be
saying
anything
like
that
to
eugenia
he
thought
how
much
she
must
have
changed
to
be
able
to
write
me
the
letter
she
did
he
opened
the
box
and
took
out
the
little
ring
as
he
turned
it
around
on
the
tip
of
his
finger
he
remembered
that
it
was
almost
time
for
her
to
be
coming
home
the
house
party
would
soon
be
at
an
end
hardly
worth
while
to
send
it
to
her
he
thought
she
will
be
coming
home
so
soon
when
we
are
down
at
the
seashore
i
will
give
it
to
her
the
letter
she
had
written
him
lay
open
on
the
table
before
him
that
letter
blotted
with
penitent
tears
had
brought
a
new
tenderness
into
his
heart
for
her
it
had
revealed
a
different
eugenia
from
the
one
he
had
been
accustomed
to
thinking
of
as
his
little
daughter
somehow
she
seemed
nearer
and
dearer
than
she
had
ever
done
before
and
he
wanted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
tell
her
so
the
next
instant
the
thought
flashed
across
his
mind
well
why
not
this
is
the
time
i
have
arranged
to
take
my
vacation
and
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
my
going
down
to
kentucky
after
her
jack
sherman
is
always
urging
me
to
visit
locust
and
i
give
the
child
a
surprise
she
dislikes
to
travel
with
only
eliot
eugenia
knew
nothing
of
the
telegram
her
cousin
elizabeth
received
next
morning
so
several
days
later
she
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
when
she
saw
her
father
spring
out
of
the
carriage
in
front
of
the
house
and
come
bounding
up
the
steps
between
the
white
pillars
of
the
porch
tall
handsome
smiling
he
came
toward
her
his
arms
outstretched
and
after
one
amazed
glance
she
ran
into
them
crying
oh
papa
papa
i
so
glad
i
could
do
without
my
little
girl
any
longer
he
said
i
had
to
come
for
her
sherman
came
out
just
then
with
the
warmest
of
welcomes
and
eugenia
rushed
for
a
moment
to
tell
betty
about
her
surprise
and
to
hurry
joyce
and
lloyd
down
to
greet
her
father
i
am
going
to
begin
all
over
again
now
she
said
to
herself
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
i
be
as
good
and
sweet
to
him
as
he
deserves
i
let
him
see
how
proud
i
am
of
him
too
it
queer
but
somehow
i
really
love
him
better
since
i
have
thought
so
much
about
betty
memory
roads
well
i
shall
certainly
try
my
best
from
now
on
to
leave
a
happy
one
behind
for
him
he
gave
her
the
ring
that
night
the
little
golden
lover
knot
with
the
name
of
tusitala
engraved
inside
to
remind
her
always
of
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
that
she
might
leave
in
the
world
after
her
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
his
arm
around
her
they
talked
long
and
freely
together
as
they
had
never
done
before
once
he
looked
at
her
with
a
quizzical
little
smile
i
never
realised
until
he
said
how
old
you
are
or
how
companionable
you
can
be
but
we
always
be
good
chums
after
this
wo
we
yes
she
answered
giving
his
ear
a
playful
tweak
and
mischievously
imitating
his
tone
and
manner
and
i
never
realised
until
how
young
you
are
or
how
companionable
can
be
i
believe
that
if
you
been
at
this
house
party
from
the
beginning
you
have
been
playing
with
us
by
this
time
like
bobby
and
the
other
boys
i
must
show
this
ring
to
the
girls
she
said
presently
when
they
heard
sherman
coming
back
then
she
hesitated
her
eyes
sparkling
with
the
pleasure
of
a
sudden
thought
oh
papa
i
like
to
give
lloyd
and
joyce
and
betty
each
a
ring
like
mine
to
help
them
remember
you
know
and
as
a
souvenir
of
the
house
party
do
you
think
that
would
be
nice
i
have
scarcely
touched
my
allowance
this
month
could
we
go
to
the
city
and
get
them
yes
i
think
so
answered
her
father
we
ask
cousin
elizabeth
about
the
trains
early
next
morning
forbes
and
eugenia
went
into
the
city
on
their
little
excursion
and
scarcely
had
they
gone
when
a
telegram
arrived
from
sherman
saying
he
would
be
home
on
the
noon
train
the
little
colonel
went
dashing
around
the
house
from
one
room
to
another
calling
out
the
news
in
the
greatest
excitement
have
you
heard
it
papa
jack
comin
grandfathah
is
goin
to
stay
several
weeks
longah
but
papa
jack
comin
on
the
noon
train
some
one
else
came
on
that
noon
train
some
one
whom
doctor
fuller
met
in
his
buggy
and
took
immediately
up
to
locust
it
was
the
oculist
who
had
been
there
before
lloyd
was
so
excited
over
her
father
arrival
that
she
scarcely
noticed
they
were
in
the
house
and
she
never
knew
when
they
gravely
made
their
examination
of
betty
eyes
and
as
gravely
went
away
again
but
late
that
afternoon
eugenia
and
her
father
driving
up
from
the
station
were
surprised
to
see
a
cloud
of
dust
whirling
rapidly
down
the
road
toward
them
as
they
came
nearer
they
saw
that
tarbaby
was
in
the
centre
of
it
and
on
his
bare
back
perched
the
little
colonel
the
hot
june
sun
beating
down
on
her
bare
head
and
red
face
as
she
came
within
calling
distance
she
waved
her
arms
frantically
to
stop
the
carriage
and
shrieked
out
at
the
top
of
her
voice
papa
jack
home
and
oh
eugenia
can
the
carriage
stopped
and
eugenia
leaned
out
eagerly
i
could
wait
for
you
to
get
home
cried
the
little
colonel
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
train
whistle
i
jumped
on
tarbaby
without
a
saddle
or
anything
and
just
down
heah
to
tell
you
of
she
use
her
eyes
much
fo
a
long
time
and
will
have
to
weah
a
shade
weeks
but
when
they
tested
her
eyes
she
and
she
is
goin
to
be
blind
eugenia
gave
a
great
deep
sigh
of
thankfulness
and
leaned
limply
back
in
the
carriage
oh
papa
she
exclaimed
you
ca
imagine
what
a
relief
it
is
to
hear
that
i
felt
so
much
to
blame
that
now
it
seems
as
if
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
off
from
me
they
were
having
a
jubilee
in
betty
room
when
eugenia
and
her
father
reached
the
house
sherman
told
them
so
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
called
them
to
come
on
up
and
join
in
it
it
was
a
very
quiet
jubilee
the
doctor
had
insisted
on
that
but
the
unspoken
joy
of
the
little
face
on
the
pillow
made
happiness
in
every
heart
it
was
the
first
time
that
forbes
had
seen
betty
she
was
lying
with
her
brown
curls
tossed
back
on
the
pillows
her
eyes
still
bandaged
but
the
smile
on
the
little
mouth
was
one
of
the
sweetest
gladdest
things
he
had
ever
seen
involuntarily
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
softly
on
the
forehead
who
is
it
asked
betty
reaching
out
a
wondering
little
hand
eugenia
father
lloyd
calls
me
cousin
carl
answered
forbes
taking
the
groping
fingers
in
his
and
i
think
that
the
little
betty
that
everybody
is
so
fond
of
might
call
me
that
too
i
be
glad
to
cousin
carl
said
the
child
bashfully
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
warm
and
steadfast
friendship
eugenia
waited
until
later
when
her
father
and
sherman
had
left
the
room
before
she
opened
her
packages
hold
fast
all
i
give
you
she
exclaimed
gaily
tossing
a
tiny
white
box
into
joyce
lap
and
another
into
lloyd
but
the
third
one
she
opened
and
taking
out
the
ring
it
held
slipped
it
on
betty
finger
they
are
all
like
the
one
papa
gave
me
she
said
and
have
name
inside
to
help
me
remember
the
memory
roads
that
betty
told
us
about
it
will
remind
me
of
more
than
that
said
betty
gratefully
when
she
and
the
girls
had
expressed
their
thanks
in
a
chorus
of
delighted
exclamations
it
will
remind
me
of
the
happiest
day
in
my
life
this
is
the
first
ring
i
ever
owned
she
added
turning
it
proudly
on
her
finger
i
wish
i
could
see
it
then
with
a
gladness
in
her
voice
that
thrilled
her
listeners
but
i
see
it
some
day
oh
girls
you
could
know
you
could
possibly
imagine
how
much
that
means
to
me
unless
you
been
shut
up
as
i
have
in
this
awful
darkness
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
eugenia
stooped
over
and
gave
her
a
quick
impulsive
kiss
well
your
blindness
did
some
good
betty
she
said
speaking
hurriedly
and
with
very
red
cheeks
it
made
me
see
how
hateful
and
selfish
i
always
been
and
i
never
going
to
be
so
mean
again
to
anybody
as
i
was
to
you
i
trying
to
dig
a
road
like
tusitala
and
i
never
would
have
thought
of
it
if
it
had
been
for
you
with
that
she
turned
hastily
and
running
across
the
hall
to
her
own
room
shut
the
door
behind
her
with
a
bang
chapter
xvi
a
feast
of
lanterns
the
first
week
of
july
had
come
to
an
end
and
with
it
came
the
end
of
the
house
party
oh
deah
croaked
the
little
colonel
like
a
dismal
raven
as
she
waited
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
for
the
girls
to
finish
dressing
this
is
the
mawnin
well
all
go
racin
down
to
breakfast
togethah
glad
that
betty
is
goin
away
for
a
while
longah
if
you
all
had
to
leave
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
so
lonesome
that
i
could
stand
it
i
am
glad
too
said
betty
groping
her
way
slowly
out
of
her
room
with
a
green
shade
over
her
eyes
her
long
night
was
nearly
over
now
although
it
would
be
several
months
before
she
would
be
allowed
to
read
her
godmother
had
written
to
appleton
saying
that
she
wanted
to
keep
betty
with
her
until
her
eyes
were
stronger
and
the
child
had
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
when
she
received
permission
to
stay
never
dreaming
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
ever
saw
the
nest
again
this
is
the
time
we
ever
ride
together
sighed
joyce
as
she
mounted
calico
after
breakfast
oh
it
has
been
such
fun
lloyd
and
i
enjoyed
this
little
clown
pony
more
than
i
can
ever
tell
he
is
the
dearest
ugliest
little
beast
that
ever
wore
a
halter
and
i
never
forget
him
as
long
as
i
live
and
this
is
the
last
time
we
can
go
galloping
out
of
this
gate
together
and
see
the
boys
coming
up
the
road
to
meet
us
cried
eugenia
there
they
are
all
three
of
them
oh
they
have
heard
the
news
yet
i
going
to
dash
on
ahead
and
tell
them
eugenia
news
was
that
she
was
going
abroad
with
her
father
in
the
fall
it
had
all
been
arranged
since
he
came
to
locust
finding
that
business
required
one
of
the
members
of
his
firm
to
spend
a
month
in
england
he
telegraphed
back
to
the
office
that
he
would
go
i
do
know
which
is
the
most
excited
over
the
prospect
myself
or
my
maid
said
eugenia
to
the
boys
poor
old
eliot
is
simply
wild
with
delight
at
the
thought
of
seeing
her
home
and
family
again
and
i
am
nearly
as
much
upset
as
she
is
we
to
be
gone
five
or
six
months
papa
says
that
while
we
are
over
there
we
might
as
well
go
the
rounds
so
maybe
we
spend
christmas
in
france
in
the
same
place
that
joyce
did
what
time
do
you
leave
locust
asked
malcolm
on
the
ten
train
i
think
joyce
is
going
with
us
part
of
the
way
as
papa
has
to
make
a
trip
to
louis
before
we
go
back
to
new
york
and
which
way
are
you
all
going
now
asked
keith
the
others
had
joined
them
and
the
seven
ponies
were
standing
in
a
ring
in
the
middle
of
the
road
their
noses
almost
touching
we
going
down
to
your
house
answered
joyce
to
bid
your
grandmother
macintyre
and
miss
allison
they
have
been
so
good
to
us
all
the
time
we
have
been
here
your
aunt
allison
has
done
so
much
to
entertain
us
and
as
for
your
grandmother
i
could
begin
to
tell
you
how
she
cheered
us
up
when
we
had
the
measles
there
was
something
from
her
every
day
fruit
and
flowers
and
wine
jellies
and
messages
one
of
my
sweetest
memories
of
kentucky
will
be
of
your
beautiful
grandmother
instantly
both
the
boys
lifted
their
hats
in
acknowledgment
but
keith
exclaimed
in
boyish
impatience
oh
pshaw
i
thought
we
were
all
going
over
to
the
mill
this
morning
the
last
time
you
know
there
no
need
of
your
going
down
to
bid
them
when
we
see
you
at
but
lloyd
stopped
him
with
a
finger
on
her
lip
and
a
threatening
shake
of
her
head
come
on
she
cried
starting
tarbaby
down
the
road
at
full
gallop
we
ca
stand
heah
in
the
road
all
day
keith
dashed
after
her
laying
a
detaining
hand
on
her
bridle
when
he
reached
her
side
what
the
matter
miss
savage
he
asked
what
do
you
mean
by
shaking
your
head
at
me
in
that
way
ca
you
keep
a
secret
she
demanded
crossly
you
know
well
enough
we
want
to
surprise
the
girls
oh
i
forgot
he
exclaimed
clapping
a
hand
over
his
mouth
they
are
not
to
know
a
thing
about
it
until
time
to
light
the
lanterns
she
said
severely
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
rude
indeed
for
them
not
to
make
a
call
at
yo
house
this
mawnin
even
if
you
all
are
comin
up
oh
i
say
lloyd
leave
a
little
piece
of
me
please
he
begged
in
a
meek
voice
at
least
enough
to
help
wind
up
the
house
party
say
you
forgive
me
he
insisted
clasping
his
hands
together
and
looking
at
her
with
such
a
comical
expression
that
she
could
not
help
laughing
the
last
time
it
the
last
time
they
said
it
as
they
stopped
once
more
for
the
mail
at
the
little
as
they
turned
regretfully
homeward
as
they
went
down
the
long
avenue
in
the
shade
of
the
friendly
old
locusts
they
said
it
again
when
they
wandered
four
abreast
and
arm
in
arm
about
the
place
for
a
farewell
glance
at
every
nook
and
corner
where
they
had
romped
and
played
in
the
five
weeks
just
gone
even
when
the
words
were
not
wailed
out
disconsolately
by
one
of
them
and
echoed
by
the
others
the
thought
that
each
thing
they
were
doing
was
for
the
last
time
went
with
them
like
a
mournful
undercurrent
did
you
ever
have
a
day
fly
by
as
fast
as
this
one
asked
joyce
that
afternoon
looking
up
from
the
trunk
that
mom
beck
was
helping
her
to
pack
here
it
is
nearly
six
and
i
have
been
down
to
the
i
wanted
one
more
swing
on
the
swing
before
i
dressed
for
dinner
it
like
flying
to
go
sailing
through
the
air
across
the
ravine
on
that
that
covers
the
there
wo
be
time
now
said
the
little
colonel
casting
an
anxious
look
toward
the
front
windows
if
the
girls
had
not
been
so
busily
occupied
they
might
have
noticed
how
she
had
been
manoeuvring
for
some
time
to
keep
them
away
from
the
front
windows
she
even
took
them
down
the
back
stairs
when
they
were
ready
for
dinner
with
the
excuse
that
she
wanted
them
to
see
the
hamper
in
which
joyce
puppy
was
to
travel
eugenia
bob
was
to
be
left
at
locust
until
after
she
had
made
her
trip
abroad
joyce
had
a
fresh
blue
satin
ribbon
packed
away
in
her
satchel
to
tie
around
her
bob
neck
just
before
reaching
home
oh
girls
she
exclaimed
do
you
know
that
those
children
are
going
to
be
delighted
when
this
fat
little
dumpling
comes
rolling
out
of
the
hamper
they
will
all
grab
for
him
at
once
and
mary
will
be
so
tickled
she
will
squeal
she
always
does
when
she
is
excited
and
it
is
funny
i
wish
i
could
hear
her
do
it
this
blessed
minute
somehow
i
can
hardly
wait
to
see
them
all
now
although
i
do
want
to
leave
locust
one
bit
i
have
had
a
good
time
mom
beck
came
out
just
then
to
tell
them
that
dinner
was
waiting
and
lloyd
hurried
them
through
the
back
hall
again
although
she
herself
ran
to
the
front
door
and
looked
out
before
she
took
her
seat
at
the
table
it
was
a
merry
meal
for
papa
jack
told
his
best
stories
and
cousin
carl
as
they
all
called
forbes
now
recalled
his
funniest
jokes
to
make
the
children
forget
how
near
they
had
come
to
the
parting
hour
and
when
the
dessert
was
brought
on
they
sang
a
duet
they
had
learned
when
together
at
which
every
one
laughed
until
the
tears
stood
in
their
eyes
while
they
lingered
at
the
table
alec
and
walker
and
mom
beck
and
all
the
servants
on
the
place
who
could
lend
a
hand
were
turning
the
lawn
into
they
had
been
busy
for
several
hours
putting
up
strings
of
lanterns
and
now
they
were
lighting
them
row
after
row
big
lanterns
and
little
lanterns
round
ones
and
square
of
every
size
colour
and
shape
lit
up
the
darkness
of
the
summer
night
huge
red
dragons
swung
between
the
white
pillars
of
the
porch
luminous
fish
and
beasts
and
birds
hanging
from
the
shrubs
and
trees
on
the
lawn
set
every
bough
while
all
through
the
grass
and
all
through
the
flower
beds
the
flashing
of
hundreds
of
tiny
fairy
lamps
made
it
seem
as
if
the
were
holding
carnival
there
were
tents
pitched
on
the
lawn
and
tables
set
out
here
and
there
and
every
tent
was
brilliant
with
festoons
of
light
and
every
table
had
a
canopy
fringed
with
flaming
balls
of
ruby
and
emerald
and
amber
but
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
whole
dazzling
scene
was
the
old
locust
avenue
strung
from
top
to
bottom
with
lights
the
trees
seemed
suddenly
to
have
burst
into
bloom
with
stars
when
all
down
that
long
arch
from
entrance
gate
to
mansion
shone
the
soft
glow
of
a
myriad
welcoming
lanterns
illustration
let
all
sit
down
on
the
steps
let
all
sit
down
on
the
steps
and
enjoy
it
before
the
people
begin
to
come
said
the
little
colonel
after
the
first
burst
of
surprise
and
enthusiastic
admiration
was
over
everybody
in
the
valley
will
be
heah
in
a
little
bit
to
say
to
you
all
and
we
told
to
come
early
because
your
train
leaves
so
soon
even
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
turning
in
at
the
gate
and
the
band
in
the
arbour
began
tuning
their
violins
it
was
not
long
before
the
place
was
gay
with
many
voices
and
people
were
streaming
back
and
forth
over
the
lawn
and
porches
grown
people
as
well
as
children
were
there
all
who
had
been
at
the
party
all
who
had
entertained
the
girls
in
any
way
and
all
who
had
been
friends
of
betty
mother
and
joyce
in
their
girlhood
after
awhile
when
the
guests
were
being
served
with
refreshments
under
the
canopies
on
the
lawn
forbes
looked
around
for
betty
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
at
first
but
presently
he
stumbled
over
her
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
porch
with
her
shade
pulled
over
her
eyes
it
too
bad
you
ca
enjoy
it
like
the
rest
of
us
he
said
sympathetically
i
am
enjoying
it
with
all
my
heart
cousin
carl
protested
betty
i
have
raised
my
shade
half
a
dozen
times
and
taken
a
quick
glance
around
and
the
music
is
so
sweet
and
everybody
comes
up
and
says
nice
things
to
me
i
would
be
perfectly
happy
if
i
did
keep
thinking
that
this
is
the
last
of
our
good
times
together
and
in
a
little
while
i
shall
have
to
say
to
eugenia
and
joyce
you
know
i
never
knew
any
girls
before
she
added
confidentially
and
you
ca
imagine
how
much
i
have
enjoyed
them
come
walk
down
to
the
gate
with
me
said
forbes
presently
i
have
something
to
tell
you
she
lifted
her
shade
an
instant
as
they
started
down
the
long
arch
of
light
and
gave
one
quick
glance
down
the
entire
way
is
it
glorious
she
exclaimed
it
looks
as
if
it
might
be
the
road
to
the
city
of
the
shining
ones
then
with
a
sigh
she
dropped
her
shade
and
slipping
her
hand
into
his
let
him
lead
her
as
she
walked
along
with
closed
eyes
you
are
an
appreciative
little
puss
he
said
smiling
as
they
walked
on
under
the
glowing
arch
hand
in
hand
he
told
her
that
he
was
coming
back
for
her
in
the
fall
that
eugenia
wanted
her
to
go
abroad
with
them
and
that
he
thought
such
an
arrangement
would
be
good
for
both
the
girls
good
for
eugenia
because
otherwise
she
would
often
be
left
for
days
at
a
time
with
only
eliot
for
a
companion
when
he
was
away
on
business
good
for
betty
since
she
could
be
enjoying
the
advantages
of
travel
at
a
time
when
she
could
not
be
using
her
eyes
to
study
you
shall
see
abbotsford
he
said
and
burns
country
and
go
to
shakespeare
home
and
you
shall
coach
among
the
english
lakes
where
wordsworth
learned
to
write
then
there
is
rome
on
her
seven
hills
you
know
and
the
canals
of
venice
and
the
dutch
windmills
and
the
black
forest
you
shall
hear
the
legends
of
all
the
historic
rivers
you
cross
and
mountains
you
climb
and
listen
to
the
music
of
the
norwegian
waterfalls
do
you
think
it
will
help
you
to
be
a
better
for
the
children
some
day
my
little
you
see
your
godmother
has
been
telling
me
some
of
your
secrets
and
showing
me
some
of
your
poems
and
stories
what
do
you
say
betty
will
you
go
will
i
go
cried
betty
joyfully
holding
his
hand
tight
in
both
her
own
and
pressing
it
lovingly
to
her
cheek
oh
cousin
carl
you
might
as
well
ask
me
if
i
would
go
to
heaven
if
a
big
strong
angel
had
come
down
on
purpose
to
carry
me
up
oh
is
everybody
so
good
to
me
i
ca
understand
it
they
had
reached
the
gate
and
were
turning
to
walk
back
to
the
house
forbes
laid
his
hand
on
the
brown
curly
head
with
a
fatherly
touch
i
tell
you
some
day
he
said
when
there
is
more
time
it
is
all
because
of
that
road
you
discovered
little
one
that
road
of
the
loving
heart
i
do
wear
a
ring
as
eugenia
does
to
remind
me
of
it
but
been
carrying
the
inspiration
of
it
in
my
memory
ever
since
she
wrote
me
all
that
you
had
taught
her
about
it
they
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
together
under
the
locusts
that
arched
their
boughs
above
them
the
band
was
playing
softly
and
betty
uplifted
by
the
music
the
lights
and
the
good
fortune
in
store
for
her
could
hardly
believe
that
her
feet
were
touching
the
earth
she
seemed
to
be
floating
along
in
some
sort
of
dreamland
the
old
feeling
swept
over
her
that
always
came
with
the
music
of
the
harp
it
was
as
if
she
were
away
off
from
everything
her
head
among
the
stars
and
strange
beautiful
thoughts
that
she
had
no
words
for
danced
on
ahead
like
shining
joyce
was
the
first
to
share
her
good
fortune
and
while
she
was
telling
it
eugenia
came
up
with
another
joyful
announcement
we
are
going
to
tours
she
cried
and
across
the
loire
to
symphorien
where
joyce
stayed
all
winter
and
we
see
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
and
little
jules
who
lives
there
i
am
so
glad
said
joyce
you
must
get
madame
greville
to
show
you
everything
the
kiosk
in
the
old
garden
where
we
had
our
thanksgiving
barbecue
the
where
we
shut
up
the
goats
that
day
when
they
chewed
the
cushions
of
the
to
pieces
and
the
room
where
we
had
the
christmas
tree
and
the
laurel
hedges
in
bloom
oh
i
so
glad
you
going
to
see
them
all
what
that
asked
the
little
colonel
coming
up
behind
them
and
then
betty
told
her
too
only
think
lloyd
sherman
she
added
giving
her
a
rapturous
hug
if
it
had
been
for
you
it
never
would
have
happened
it
all
because
you
had
this
delightful
house
party
and
invited
me
to
come
here
comes
macintyre
interrupted
joyce
in
a
low
tone
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
fine
and
soft
and
fluffy
as
that
beautiful
white
hair
of
hers
it
looks
like
a
crimped
i
would
mind
being
a
grandmother
if
i
could
look
like
that
she
came
up
smiling
and
beckoned
the
girls
to
follow
her
i
want
to
show
you
something
comical
she
said
i
just
discovered
it
she
led
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
porch
and
there
standing
in
a
row
were
six
little
darkies
so
black
that
their
faces
scarcely
showed
against
the
black
background
of
the
night
only
their
rolling
white
eyeballs
and
gleaming
teeth
could
be
seen
distinctly
they
are
allison
protégés
she
said
sylvia
gibbs
children
you
know
they
are
always
on
the
outskirts
of
all
the
festivities
when
they
think
they
can
pick
up
any
crumbs
in
the
way
of
refreshments
but
they
have
some
good
excuse
to
give
for
coming
you
may
be
sure
oh
they
are
the
children
who
acted
the
charades
at
the
old
mill
picnic
said
eugenia
drawing
nearer
get
them
to
talk
if
you
can
macintyre
please
do
except
for
a
broader
grin
in
token
that
they
heard
questions
they
were
as
unresponsive
as
six
little
black
kittens
and
keith
coming
up
just
then
was
sent
to
find
miss
allison
they
always
talk
for
auntie
he
said
she
is
over
in
one
of
the
tents
and
i
go
get
her
keith
was
right
miss
allison
proved
the
key
that
unlocked
every
little
red
tongue
and
they
answered
her
questions
glibly
we
don
brought
sumpin
to
miss
stammered
tildy
shyly
she
got
a
chicken
