conclusion
chapter
one
the
millionaire
and
the
waiter
yes
sir
jules
the
celebrated
head
waiter
of
the
grand
babylon
was
bending
formally
towards
the
alert
man
who
had
just
entered
the
and
dropped
into
a
in
the
corner
by
the
conservatory
it
was
on
a
particularly
sultry
june
night
and
dinner
was
about
to
be
served
at
the
grand
babylon
men
of
all
sizes
ages
and
nationalities
but
every
one
alike
arrayed
in
faultless
evening
dress
were
dotted
about
the
large
dim
apartment
a
faint
odour
of
flowers
came
from
the
conservatory
and
the
tinkle
of
a
fountain
the
waiters
commanded
by
jules
moved
softly
across
the
thick
oriental
rugs
balancing
their
trays
with
the
dexterity
of
jugglers
and
receiving
and
executing
orders
with
that
air
of
profound
importance
of
which
only
really
waiters
have
the
secret
the
atmosphere
was
an
atmosphere
of
serenity
and
repose
characteristic
of
the
grand
babylon
it
seemed
impossible
that
anything
could
occur
to
mar
the
peaceful
aristocratic
monotony
of
existence
in
that
establishment
yet
on
that
night
was
to
happen
the
mightiest
upheaval
that
the
grand
babylon
had
ever
known
yes
sir
repeated
jules
and
this
time
there
was
a
shade
of
august
disapproval
in
his
voice
it
was
not
usual
for
him
to
have
to
address
a
customer
twice
oh
said
the
alert
man
looking
up
at
length
beautifully
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
the
great
jules
he
allowed
his
grey
eyes
to
twinkle
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
expression
on
the
waiter
s
face
bring
me
an
angel
pardon
sir
bring
me
an
angel
kiss
and
be
good
enough
to
lose
no
if
it
s
an
american
drink
i
fear
we
don
t
keep
it
the
voice
of
jules
fell
icily
distinct
and
several
men
glanced
round
uneasily
as
if
to
deprecate
the
slightest
disturbance
of
their
calm
the
appearance
of
the
person
to
whom
jules
was
speaking
however
reassured
them
somewhat
for
he
had
all
the
look
of
that
expert
the
travelled
englishman
who
can
differentiate
between
one
hotel
and
another
by
instinct
and
who
knows
at
once
where
he
may
make
a
fuss
with
propriety
and
where
it
is
advisable
to
behave
exactly
as
at
the
club
the
grand
babylon
was
a
hotel
in
whose
one
behaved
as
though
one
was
at
one
s
club
i
didn
t
suppose
you
did
keep
it
but
you
can
mix
it
i
guess
even
in
this
this
isn
t
an
american
hotel
the
calculated
insolence
of
the
words
was
cleverly
masked
beneath
an
accent
of
humble
submission
the
alert
man
sat
up
straight
and
gazed
placidly
at
jules
who
was
pulling
his
famous
red
get
a
liqueur
glass
he
said
half
curtly
and
half
with
tolerance
pour
into
it
equal
quantities
of
maraschino
cream
and
crême
de
menthe
don
t
stir
it
don
t
shake
it
bring
it
to
me
and
i
say
tell
the
sir
tell
the
to
make
a
note
of
the
recipe
as
i
shall
probably
want
an
angel
kiss
every
evening
before
dinner
so
long
as
this
weather
i
will
send
the
drink
to
you
sir
said
jules
distantly
that
was
his
parting
shot
by
which
he
indicated
that
he
was
not
as
other
waiters
are
and
that
any
person
who
treated
him
with
disrespect
did
so
at
his
own
peril
a
few
minutes
later
while
the
alert
man
was
tasting
the
angel
kiss
jules
sat
in
conclave
with
miss
spencer
who
had
charge
of
the
bureau
of
the
grand
babylon
this
bureau
was
a
fairly
large
chamber
with
two
sliding
glass
partitions
which
overlooked
the
and
the
only
a
small
portion
of
the
clerical
work
of
the
great
hotel
was
performed
there
the
place
served
chiefly
as
the
lair
of
miss
spencer
who
was
as
well
known
and
as
important
as
jules
himself
most
modern
hotels
have
a
male
clerk
to
superintend
the
bureau
but
the
grand
babylon
went
its
own
way
miss
spencer
had
been
bureau
clerk
almost
since
the
grand
babylon
had
first
raised
its
massive
chimneys
to
heaven
and
she
remained
in
her
place
despite
the
vagaries
of
other
hotels
always
admirably
dressed
in
plain
black
silk
with
a
small
diamond
brooch
immaculate
and
frizzed
yellow
hair
she
looked
now
just
as
she
had
looked
an
indefinite
number
of
years
ago
her
age
none
knew
it
save
herself
and
perhaps
one
other
and
none
cared
the
gracious
and
alluring
contours
of
her
figure
were
irreproachable
and
in
the
evenings
she
was
a
useful
ornament
of
which
any
hotel
might
be
innocently
proud
her
knowledge
of
bradshaw
of
steamship
services
and
the
programmes
of
theatres
and
was
unrivalled
yet
she
never
travelled
she
never
went
to
a
theatre
or
a
she
seemed
to
spend
the
whole
of
her
life
in
that
official
lair
of
hers
imparting
information
to
guests
telephoning
to
the
various
departments
or
engaged
in
intimate
conversations
with
her
special
friends
on
the
staff
as
at
present
who
s
number
jules
asked
this
lady
miss
spencer
examined
her
ledgers
mr
theodore
racksole
new
i
thought
he
must
be
a
new
yorker
said
jules
after
a
brief
significant
pause
but
he
talks
as
good
english
as
you
or
me
says
he
wants
an
angel
kiss
maraschino
and
cream
if
you
please
every
night
i
ll
see
he
doesn
t
stop
here
too
miss
spencer
smiled
grimly
in
response
the
notion
of
referring
to
theodore
racksole
as
a
new
yorker
appealed
to
her
sense
of
humour
a
sense
in
which
she
was
not
entirely
deficient
she
knew
of
course
and
she
knew
that
jules
knew
that
this
theodore
racksole
must
be
the
unique
and
only
theodore
racksole
the
third
richest
man
in
the
united
states
and
therefore
probably
in
the
world
nevertheless
she
ranged
herself
at
once
on
the
side
of
jules
just
as
there
was
only
one
racksole
so
there
was
only
one
jules
and
miss
spencer
instinctively
shared
the
latter
s
indignation
at
the
spectacle
of
any
person
whatsoever
millionaire
or
emperor
presuming
to
demand
an
angel
kiss
that
unrespectable
concoction
of
maraschino
and
cream
within
the
precincts
of
the
grand
babylon
in
the
world
of
hotels
it
was
currently
stated
that
next
to
the
proprietor
there
were
three
gods
at
the
grand
babylon
jules
the
head
waiter
miss
spencer
and
most
powerful
of
all
rocco
the
renowned
chef
who
earned
two
thousand
a
year
and
had
a
chalet
on
the
lake
of
lucerne
all
the
great
hotels
in
northumberland
avenue
and
on
the
thames
embankment
had
tried
to
get
rocco
away
from
the
grand
babylon
but
without
success
rocco
was
well
aware
that
even
he
could
rise
no
higher
than
the
maître
hotel
of
the
grand
babylon
which
though
it
never
advertised
itself
and
didn
t
belong
to
a
limited
company
stood
an
easy
first
among
the
hotels
of
europe
first
in
expensiveness
first
in
exclusiveness
first
in
that
mysterious
quality
known
as
style
situated
on
the
embankment
the
grand
babylon
despite
its
noble
proportions
was
somewhat
dwarfed
by
several
colossal
neighbours
it
had
but
three
hundred
and
fifty
rooms
whereas
there
are
two
hotels
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
with
six
hundred
and
four
hundred
rooms
respectively
on
the
other
hand
the
grand
babylon
was
the
only
hotel
in
london
with
a
genuine
separate
entrance
for
royal
visitors
constantly
in
use
the
grand
babylon
counted
that
day
wasted
on
which
it
did
not
entertain
at
the
lowest
a
german
prince
or
the
maharajah
of
some
indian
state
when
felix
babylon
after
whom
and
not
with
any
reference
to
london
s
nickname
the
hotel
was
christened
when
felix
babylon
founded
the
hotel
in
he
had
set
himself
to
cater
for
royalty
and
that
was
the
secret
of
his
triumphant
eminence
the
son
of
a
rich
swiss
hotel
proprietor
and
financier
he
had
contrived
to
established
a
connection
with
the
officials
of
several
european
courts
and
he
had
not
spared
money
in
that
respect
sundry
kings
and
not
a
few
princesses
called
him
felix
and
spoke
familiarly
of
the
hotel
as
felix
s
and
felix
had
found
that
this
was
very
good
for
trade
the
grand
babylon
was
managed
accordingly
the
note
of
its
policy
was
discretion
always
discretion
and
quietude
simplicity
remoteness
the
place
was
like
a
palace
incognito
there
was
no
gold
sign
over
the
roof
not
even
an
explanatory
word
at
the
entrance
you
walked
down
a
small
side
street
off
the
strand
you
saw
a
plain
brown
building
in
front
of
you
with
two
mahogany
swing
doors
and
an
official
behind
each
the
doors
opened
noiselessly
you
entered
you
were
in
felix
s
if
you
meant
to
be
a
guest
you
or
your
courier
gave
your
card
to
miss
spencer
upon
no
consideration
did
you
ask
for
the
tariff
it
was
not
good
form
to
mention
prices
at
the
grand
babylon
the
prices
were
enormous
but
you
never
mentioned
them
at
the
conclusion
of
your
stay
a
bill
was
presented
brief
and
void
of
dry
details
and
you
paid
it
without
a
word
you
met
with
a
stately
civility
that
was
all
no
one
had
originally
asked
you
to
come
no
one
expressed
the
hope
that
you
would
come
again
the
grand
babylon
was
far
above
such
manoeuvres
it
defied
competition
by
ignoring
it
and
consequently
was
nearly
always
full
during
the
season
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
that
annoyed
the
grand
its
back
up
so
to
speak
it
was
to
be
compared
with
or
to
be
mistaken
for
an
american
hotel
the
grand
babylon
was
resolutely
opposed
to
american
methods
of
eating
drinking
and
lodging
but
especially
american
methods
of
drinking
the
resentment
of
jules
on
being
requested
to
supply
mr
theodore
racksole
with
an
angel
kiss
will
therefore
be
appreciated
anybody
with
mr
theodore
racksole
asked
jules
continuing
his
conversation
with
miss
spencer
he
put
a
scornful
stress
on
every
syllable
of
the
guest
s
name
miss
racksole
she
s
in
no
jules
paused
and
stroked
his
left
whisker
as
it
lay
on
his
gleaming
white
collar
she
s
where
he
queried
with
a
peculiar
emphasis
no
i
couldn
t
help
it
there
was
no
other
room
with
a
bathroom
and
on
that
miss
spencer
s
voice
had
an
appealing
tone
of
excuse
why
didn
t
you
tell
mr
theodore
racksole
and
miss
racksole
that
we
were
unable
to
accommodate
them
because
babs
was
within
only
three
people
in
the
wide
world
ever
dreamt
of
applying
to
mr
felix
babylon
the
playful
but
mean
abbreviation
babs
those
three
were
jules
miss
spencer
and
rocco
jules
had
invented
it
no
one
but
he
would
have
had
either
the
wit
or
the
audacity
to
do
so
you
d
better
see
that
miss
racksole
changes
her
room
jules
said
after
another
pause
leave
it
to
me
i
ll
fix
it
au
revoir
it
s
three
minutes
to
eight
i
shall
take
charge
of
the
myself
and
jules
departed
rubbing
his
fine
white
hands
slowly
and
meditatively
it
was
a
trick
of
his
to
rub
his
hands
with
a
strange
roundabout
motion
and
the
action
denoted
that
some
unusual
excitement
was
in
the
air
at
eight
o
clock
precisely
dinner
was
served
in
the
immense
salle
manger
that
chaste
yet
splendid
apartment
of
white
and
gold
at
a
small
table
near
one
of
the
windows
a
young
lady
sat
alone
her
frocks
said
paris
but
her
face
unmistakably
said
new
york
it
was
a
and
bewitching
face
the
face
of
a
woman
thoroughly
accustomed
to
doing
exactly
what
she
liked
when
she
liked
how
she
liked
the
face
of
a
woman
who
had
taught
hundreds
of
gilded
young
men
the
true
art
of
fetching
and
carrying
and
who
by
twenty
years
or
so
of
parental
spoiling
had
come
to
regard
herself
as
the
feminine
equivalent
of
the
tsar
of
all
the
russias
such
women
are
only
made
in
america
and
they
only
come
to
their
full
bloom
in
europe
which
they
imagine
to
be
a
continent
created
by
providence
for
their
diversion
the
young
lady
by
the
window
glanced
disapprovingly
at
the
menu
card
then
she
looked
round
the
and
while
admiring
the
diners
decided
that
the
room
itself
was
rather
small
and
plain
then
she
gazed
through
the
open
window
and
told
herself
that
though
the
thames
by
twilight
was
passable
enough
it
was
by
no
means
level
with
the
hudson
on
whose
shores
her
father
had
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
country
cottage
then
she
returned
to
the
menu
and
with
a
pursing
of
lovely
lips
said
that
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
to
eat
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
it
was
mr
racksole
the
intrepid
millionaire
who
had
dared
to
order
an
angel
kiss
in
the
of
the
grand
babylon
nella
her
proper
name
was
helen
smiled
at
her
parent
cautiously
reserving
to
herself
the
right
to
scold
if
she
should
feel
so
inclined
you
always
are
late
father
she
said
only
on
a
holiday
he
added
what
is
there
to
eat
then
let
s
have
it
i
m
hungry
i
m
never
so
hungry
as
when
i
m
being
seriously
consommé
britannia
she
began
to
read
out
from
the
menu
saumon
d
ecosse
sauce
genoise
aspics
de
homard
oh
heavens
who
wants
these
horrid
messes
on
a
night
like
this
but
nella
this
is
the
best
cooking
in
europe
he
protested
say
father
she
said
with
seeming
irrelevance
had
you
forgotten
it
s
my
birthday
have
i
ever
forgotten
your
birthday
o
most
costly
daughter
on
the
whole
you
ve
been
a
most
satisfactory
dad
she
answered
sweetly
and
to
reward
you
i
ll
be
content
this
year
with
the
cheapest
birthday
treat
you
ever
gave
me
only
i
ll
have
it
well
he
said
with
the
patience
the
readiness
for
any
surprise
of
a
parent
whom
nella
had
thoroughly
trained
what
is
it
it
s
this
let
s
have
filleted
steak
and
a
bottle
of
bass
for
dinner
it
will
be
simply
exquisite
i
shall
love
but
my
dear
nella
he
exclaimed
steak
and
beer
at
felix
s
it
s
impossible
moreover
young
women
still
under
can
not
be
permitted
to
drink
i
said
steak
and
bass
and
as
for
being
shall
be
going
in
miss
racksole
set
her
small
white
teeth
there
was
a
gentle
cough
jules
stood
over
them
it
must
have
been
out
of
a
pure
spirit
of
adventure
that
he
had
selected
this
table
for
his
own
services
usually
jules
did
not
personally
wait
at
dinner
he
merely
hovered
observant
like
a
captain
on
the
bridge
during
the
mate
s
watch
regular
frequenters
of
the
hotel
felt
themselves
honoured
when
jules
attached
himself
to
their
tables
theodore
racksole
hesitated
one
second
and
then
issued
the
order
with
a
fine
air
of
carelessness
filleted
steak
for
two
and
a
bottle
of
it
was
the
bravest
act
of
theodore
racksole
s
life
and
yet
at
more
than
one
previous
crisis
a
high
courage
had
not
been
lacking
to
him
it
s
not
in
the
menu
sir
said
jules
the
imperturbable
never
mind
get
it
we
want
very
good
jules
walked
to
the
and
merely
affecting
to
look
behind
came
immediately
back
again
mr
rocco
s
compliments
sir
and
he
regrets
to
be
unable
to
serve
steak
and
bass
mr
rocco
questioned
racksole
lightly
mr
rocco
repeated
jules
with
firmness
and
who
is
mr
rocco
mr
rocco
is
our
chef
jules
had
the
expression
of
a
man
who
is
asked
to
explain
who
shakespeare
was
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
it
seemed
incredible
that
theodore
racksole
the
ineffable
racksole
who
owned
a
thousand
miles
of
railway
several
towns
and
sixty
votes
in
congress
should
be
defied
by
a
waiter
or
even
by
a
whole
hotel
yet
so
it
was
when
europe
s
effete
back
is
against
the
wall
not
a
regiment
of
millionaires
can
turn
its
flank
jules
had
the
calm
expression
of
a
strong
man
sure
of
victory
his
face
said
you
beat
me
once
but
not
this
time
my
new
york
friend
as
for
nella
knowing
her
father
she
foresaw
interesting
events
and
waited
confidently
for
the
steak
she
did
not
feel
hungry
and
she
could
afford
to
wait
excuse
me
a
moment
nella
said
theodore
racksole
quietly
i
shall
be
back
in
about
two
seconds
and
he
strode
out
of
the
salle
à
manger
no
one
in
the
room
recognized
the
millionaire
for
he
was
unknown
to
london
this
being
his
first
visit
to
europe
for
over
twenty
years
had
anyone
done
so
and
caught
the
expression
on
his
face
that
man
might
have
trembled
for
an
explosion
which
should
have
blown
the
entire
grand
babylon
into
the
thames
jules
retired
strategically
to
a
corner
he
had
fired
it
was
the
antagonist
s
turn
a
long
and
varied
experience
had
taught
jules
that
a
guest
who
embarks
on
the
subjugation
of
a
waiter
is
almost
always
lost
the
waiter
has
so
many
advantages
in
such
a
contest
chapter
two
how
mr
racksole
obtained
his
dinner
nevertheless
there
are
men
with
a
confirmed
habit
of
getting
their
own
way
even
as
guests
in
an
exclusive
hotel
and
theodore
racksole
had
long
since
fallen
into
that
useful
practice
except
when
his
only
daughter
helen
motherless
but
girl
chose
to
think
that
his
way
crossed
hers
in
which
case
theodore
capitulated
and
fell
back
but
when
theodore
and
his
daughter
happened
to
be
going
one
and
the
same
road
which
was
pretty
often
then
heaven
alone
might
help
any
obstacle
that
was
so
as
to
stand
in
their
path
jules
great
and
observant
man
though
he
was
had
not
noticed
the
terrible
projecting
chins
of
both
father
and
daughter
otherwise
it
is
possible
he
would
have
reconsidered
the
question
of
the
steak
and
bass
theodore
racksole
went
direct
to
the
of
the
hotel
and
entered
miss
spencer
s
sanctum
i
want
to
see
mr
babylon
he
said
without
the
delay
of
an
miss
spencer
leisurely
raised
her
flaxen
head
i
am
afraid
she
began
the
usual
formula
it
was
part
of
her
daily
duty
to
discourage
guests
who
desired
to
see
mr
babylon
no
no
said
racksole
quickly
i
don
t
want
any
i
m
this
is
business
if
you
had
been
the
ordinary
hotel
clerk
i
should
have
slipped
you
a
couple
of
sovereigns
into
your
hand
and
the
thing
would
have
been
done
as
you
are
not
as
you
are
obviously
above
bribes
i
merely
say
to
you
i
must
see
mr
babylon
at
once
on
an
affair
of
the
utmost
urgency
my
name
is
racksole
theodore
of
new
york
questioned
a
voice
at
the
door
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
the
millionaire
turned
sharply
and
saw
a
rather
short
man
with
a
bald
head
a
grey
beard
a
long
and
frock
coat
attached
to
a
minute
silver
chain
and
blue
eyes
that
seemed
to
have
the
transparent
innocence
of
a
maid
s
there
is
only
one
said
theodore
racksole
succinctly
you
wish
to
see
me
the
suggested
you
are
mr
felix
babylon
the
man
bowed
at
this
moment
i
wish
to
see
you
more
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
said
racksole
i
am
consumed
and
burnt
up
with
a
desire
to
see
you
mr
babylon
i
only
want
a
few
minutes
quiet
chat
i
fancy
i
can
settle
my
business
in
that
with
a
gesture
mr
babylon
invited
the
millionaire
down
a
side
corridor
at
the
end
of
which
was
mr
babylon
s
private
room
a
miracle
of
louis
xv
furniture
and
tapestry
like
most
unmarried
men
with
large
incomes
mr
babylon
had
tastes
of
a
highly
expensive
sort
the
landlord
and
his
guest
sat
down
opposite
each
other
theodore
racksole
had
met
with
the
usual
millionaire
s
luck
in
this
adventure
for
mr
babylon
made
a
practice
of
not
allowing
himself
to
be
interviewed
by
his
guests
however
distinguished
however
wealthy
however
pertinacious
if
he
had
not
chanced
to
enter
miss
spencer
s
office
at
that
precise
moment
and
if
he
had
not
been
impressed
in
a
somewhat
peculiar
way
by
the
physiognomy
of
the
millionaire
not
all
mr
racksole
s
american
energy
and
ingenuity
would
have
availed
for
a
confabulation
with
the
owner
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
that
night
theodore
racksole
however
was
ignorant
that
a
mere
accident
had
served
him
he
took
all
the
credit
to
himself
i
read
in
the
new
york
papers
some
months
ago
theodore
started
without
even
a
clearing
of
the
throat
that
this
hotel
of
yours
mr
babylon
was
to
be
sold
to
a
limited
company
but
it
appears
that
the
sale
was
not
carried
it
was
not
answered
mr
babylon
frankly
and
the
reason
was
that
the
between
the
proposed
company
and
myself
wished
to
make
a
large
secret
profit
and
i
declined
to
be
a
party
to
such
a
profit
they
were
firm
i
was
firm
and
so
the
affair
came
to
the
agreed
price
was
satisfactory
may
i
ask
what
the
price
was
are
you
a
buyer
mr
racksole
are
you
a
seller
mr
babylon
i
am
said
babylon
on
terms
the
price
was
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
including
the
leasehold
and
goodwill
but
i
sell
only
on
the
condition
that
the
buyer
does
not
transfer
the
property
to
a
limited
company
at
a
higher
i
will
put
one
question
to
you
mr
babylon
said
the
millionaire
what
have
your
profits
averaged
during
the
last
four
years
thousand
pounds
per
i
buy
said
theodore
racksole
smiling
contentedly
and
we
will
if
you
please
exchange
on
the
you
come
quickly
to
a
resolution
mr
racksole
but
perhaps
you
have
been
considering
this
question
for
a
long
time
on
the
contrary
racksole
looked
at
his
watch
i
have
been
considering
it
for
six
felix
babylon
bowed
as
one
thoroughly
accustomed
to
eccentricity
of
wealth
the
beauty
of
being
racksole
continued
is
that
you
needn
t
trouble
about
preliminary
explanations
you
mr
babylon
probably
know
all
about
me
i
know
a
good
deal
about
you
we
can
take
each
other
for
granted
without
reference
really
it
is
as
simple
to
buy
an
hotel
or
a
railroad
as
it
is
to
buy
a
watch
provided
one
is
equal
to
the
precisely
agreed
mr
babylon
smiling
shall
we
draw
up
the
little
informal
contract
there
are
details
to
be
thought
of
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
can
not
have
dined
yet
and
might
prefer
to
deal
with
minor
questions
after
i
have
not
dined
said
the
millionaire
with
emphasis
and
in
that
connexion
will
you
do
me
a
favour
will
you
send
for
mr
rocco
you
wish
to
see
him
i
do
said
the
millionaire
and
added
about
my
rocco
is
a
great
man
murmured
mr
babylon
as
he
touched
the
bell
ignoring
the
last
words
my
compliments
to
mr
rocco
he
said
to
the
page
who
answered
his
summons
and
if
it
is
quite
convenient
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
here
for
a
what
do
you
give
rocco
racksole
inquired
two
thousand
a
year
and
the
treatment
of
an
i
shall
give
him
the
treatment
of
an
ambassador
and
three
you
will
be
wise
said
felix
babylon
at
that
moment
rocco
came
into
the
room
very
softly
a
man
of
forty
thin
with
long
thin
hands
and
an
inordinately
long
brown
silky
moustache
rocco
said
felix
babylon
let
me
introduce
mr
theodore
racksole
of
new
sharmed
said
rocco
bowing
ze
ze
vat
you
call
it
millionaire
exactly
racksole
put
in
and
continued
quickly
mr
rocco
i
wish
to
acquaint
you
before
any
other
person
with
the
fact
that
i
have
purchased
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
if
you
think
well
to
afford
me
the
privilege
of
retaining
your
services
i
shall
be
happy
to
offer
you
a
remuneration
of
three
thousand
a
tree
you
said
and
now
mr
rocco
will
you
oblige
me
very
much
by
ordering
a
plain
beefsteak
and
a
bottle
of
bass
to
be
served
by
jules
i
particularly
desire
jules
at
table
no
in
the
in
ten
minutes
from
now
and
will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
lunching
with
me
mr
rocco
gasped
bowed
muttered
something
in
french
and
departed
five
minutes
later
the
buyer
and
seller
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
had
each
signed
a
curt
document
scribbled
out
on
the
hotel
felix
babylon
asked
no
questions
and
it
was
this
heroic
absence
of
curiosity
of
surprise
on
his
part
that
more
than
anything
else
impressed
theodore
racksole
how
many
hotel
proprietors
in
the
world
racksole
asked
himself
would
have
let
that
and
bass
go
by
without
a
word
of
comment
from
what
date
do
you
wish
the
purchase
to
take
effect
asked
babylon
oh
said
racksole
lightly
it
doesn
t
matter
shall
we
say
from
night
as
you
will
i
have
long
wished
to
retire
and
now
that
the
moment
has
come
and
so
dramatically
i
am
ready
i
shall
return
to
switzerland
one
can
not
spend
much
money
there
but
it
is
my
native
land
i
shall
be
the
richest
man
in
he
smiled
with
a
kind
of
sad
amusement
i
suppose
you
are
fairly
well
off
said
racksole
in
that
easy
familiar
style
of
his
as
though
the
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
besides
what
i
shall
receive
from
you
i
have
half
a
million
then
you
will
be
nearly
a
millionaire
felix
babylon
nodded
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
sir
said
racksole
in
the
tone
of
a
judge
addressing
a
barrister
nine
hundred
thousand
pounds
expressed
in
francs
will
sound
very
nice
in
of
course
to
you
mr
racksole
such
a
sum
would
be
poverty
now
if
one
might
guess
at
your
own
wealth
felix
babylon
was
imitating
the
other
s
freedom
i
do
not
know
to
five
millions
or
so
what
i
am
worth
said
racksole
with
sincerity
his
tone
indicating
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
give
the
information
if
it
were
in
his
power
you
have
had
anxieties
mr
racksole
still
have
them
i
am
now
in
london
with
my
daughter
in
order
to
get
rid
of
them
for
a
is
the
purchase
of
hotels
your
notion
of
relaxation
then
racksole
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
a
change
from
railroads
he
laughed
ah
my
friend
you
little
know
what
you
have
oh
yes
i
do
returned
racksole
i
have
bought
just
the
first
hotel
in
the
that
is
true
that
is
true
babylon
admitted
gazing
meditatively
at
the
antique
persian
carpet
there
is
nothing
anywhere
like
my
hotel
but
you
will
regret
the
purchase
mr
racksole
it
is
no
business
of
mine
of
course
but
i
can
not
help
repeating
that
you
will
regret
the
i
never
then
you
will
begin
very
soon
perhaps
why
do
you
say
that
because
the
grand
babylon
is
the
grand
babylon
you
think
because
you
control
a
railroad
or
an
or
a
line
of
steamers
therefore
you
can
control
anything
but
no
not
the
grand
babylon
there
is
something
about
the
grand
babylon
he
threw
up
his
hands
servants
rob
you
of
of
course
i
suppose
i
lose
a
hundred
pounds
a
week
in
that
way
but
it
is
not
that
i
mean
it
is
the
guests
the
guests
are
too
too
distinguished
the
great
ambassadors
the
great
financiers
the
great
nobles
all
the
men
that
move
the
world
put
up
under
my
roof
london
is
the
centre
of
everything
and
my
hotel
your
hotel
is
the
centre
of
london
once
i
had
a
king
and
a
dowager
empress
staying
here
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
a
great
honour
mr
babylon
but
wherein
lies
the
difficulty
mr
racksole
was
the
grim
reply
what
has
become
of
your
shrewdness
that
shrewdness
which
has
made
your
fortune
so
immense
that
even
you
can
not
calculate
it
do
you
not
perceive
that
the
roof
which
habitually
shelters
all
the
force
all
the
authority
of
the
world
must
necessarily
also
shelter
nameless
and
numberless
plotters
schemers
and
workers
of
mischief
the
thing
is
as
clear
as
day
and
as
dark
as
night
mr
racksole
i
never
know
by
whom
i
am
surrounded
i
never
know
what
is
going
forward
only
sometimes
i
get
hints
glimpses
of
strange
acts
and
strange
secrets
you
mentioned
my
servants
they
are
almost
all
good
servants
skilled
competent
but
what
are
they
besides
for
anything
i
know
my
fourth
chef
may
be
an
agent
of
some
european
government
for
anything
i
know
my
invaluable
miss
spencer
may
be
in
the
pay
of
a
court
dressmaker
or
a
frankfort
banker
even
rocco
may
be
someone
else
in
addition
to
that
makes
it
all
the
more
interesting
remarked
theodore
racksole
what
a
long
time
you
have
been
father
said
nella
when
he
returned
to
table
no
in
the
salle
à
manger
only
twenty
minutes
my
but
you
said
two
seconds
there
is
a
well
you
see
i
had
to
wait
for
the
steak
to
did
you
have
much
trouble
in
getting
my
birthday
treat
no
trouble
but
it
didn
t
come
quite
as
cheap
as
you
what
do
you
mean
father
only
that
i
ve
bought
the
entire
hotel
but
don
t
father
you
always
were
a
delicious
parent
shall
you
give
me
the
hotel
for
a
birthday
present
no
i
shall
run
it
as
an
amusement
by
the
way
who
is
that
chair
for
he
noticed
that
a
third
cover
had
been
laid
at
the
table
that
is
for
a
friend
of
mine
who
came
in
about
five
minutes
ago
of
course
i
told
him
he
must
share
our
steak
he
ll
be
here
in
a
may
i
respectfully
inquire
his
name
dimmock
christian
name
reginald
profession
english
companion
to
prince
aribert
of
posen
i
met
him
when
i
was
in
st
petersburg
with
cousin
hetty
last
fall
oh
here
he
is
mr
dimmock
this
is
my
dear
father
he
has
succeeded
with
the
theodore
racksole
found
himself
confronted
by
a
very
young
man
with
deep
black
eyes
and
a
fresh
boyish
expression
they
began
to
talk
jules
approached
with
the
steak
racksole
tried
to
catch
the
waiter
s
eye
but
could
not
the
dinner
proceeded
oh
father
cried
nella
what
a
lot
of
mustard
you
have
taken
have
i
he
said
and
then
he
happened
to
glance
into
a
mirror
on
his
left
hand
between
two
windows
he
saw
the
reflection
of
jules
who
stood
behind
his
chair
and
he
saw
jules
give
a
slow
significant
ominous
wink
to
mr
dimmock
christian
name
reginald
he
examined
his
mustard
in
silence
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
helped
himself
rather
plenteously
to
mustard
chapter
three
at
three
mr
reginald
dimmock
proved
himself
despite
his
extreme
youth
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
and
of
experiences
and
a
practised
talker
conversation
between
him
and
nella
racksole
seemed
never
to
flag
they
chattered
about
st
petersburg
and
the
ice
on
the
neva
and
the
tenor
at
the
opera
who
had
been
exiled
to
siberia
and
the
quality
of
russian
tea
and
the
sweetness
of
russian
champagne
and
various
other
aspects
of
muscovite
existence
russia
exhausted
nella
lightly
outlined
her
own
doings
since
she
had
met
the
young
man
in
the
tsar
s
capital
and
this
recital
brought
the
topic
round
to
london
where
it
stayed
till
the
final
piece
of
steak
was
eaten
theodore
racksole
noticed
that
mr
dimmock
gave
very
meagre
information
about
his
own
movements
either
past
or
future
he
regarded
the
youth
as
a
typical
of
courts
and
wondered
how
he
had
obtained
his
post
of
companion
to
prince
aribert
of
posen
and
who
prince
aribert
of
posen
might
be
the
millionaire
thought
he
had
once
heard
of
posen
but
he
wasn
t
sure
he
rather
fancied
it
was
one
of
those
small
nondescript
german
states
of
which
of
the
subjects
are
palace
officials
and
the
rest
burners
or
innkeepers
until
the
meal
was
nearly
over
racksole
said
little
perhaps
his
thoughts
were
too
busy
with
jules
wink
to
mr
dimmock
but
when
ices
had
been
followed
by
coffee
he
decided
that
it
might
be
as
well
in
the
interests
of
the
hotel
to
discover
something
about
his
daughter
s
friend
he
never
for
an
instant
questioned
her
right
to
possess
her
own
friends
he
had
always
left
her
in
the
most
amazing
liberty
relying
on
her
inherited
good
sense
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
but
quite
apart
from
the
wink
he
was
struck
by
nella
s
attitude
towards
mr
dimmock
an
attitude
in
which
an
amiable
scorn
was
blended
with
an
evident
desire
to
propitiate
and
please
nella
tells
me
mr
dimmock
that
you
hold
a
confidential
position
with
prince
aribert
of
posen
said
racksole
you
will
pardon
an
american
s
ignorance
but
is
prince
aribert
a
reigning
prince
what
i
believe
you
call
in
europe
a
prince
regnant
his
highness
is
not
a
reigning
prince
nor
ever
likely
to
be
answered
dimmock
the
grand
ducal
throne
of
posen
is
occupied
by
his
highness
s
nephew
the
grand
duke
nephew
cried
nella
with
astonishment
why
not
dear
lady
but
prince
aribert
is
surely
very
young
the
prince
by
one
of
those
vagaries
of
chance
which
occur
sometimes
in
the
history
of
families
is
precisely
the
same
age
as
the
grand
duke
the
late
grand
duke
s
father
was
twice
married
hence
this
youthfulness
on
the
part
of
an
how
delicious
to
be
the
uncle
of
someone
as
old
as
yourself
but
i
suppose
it
is
no
fun
for
prince
aribert
i
suppose
he
has
to
be
frightfully
respectful
and
obedient
and
all
that
to
his
nephew
the
grand
duke
and
my
serene
master
are
like
brothers
at
present
of
course
prince
aribert
is
nominally
heir
to
the
throne
but
as
no
doubt
you
are
aware
the
grand
duke
will
shortly
marry
a
near
relative
of
the
emperor
s
and
should
there
be
a
family
mr
dimmock
stopped
and
shrugged
his
straight
shoulders
the
grand
duke
he
went
on
without
finishing
the
last
sentence
would
much
prefer
prince
aribert
to
be
his
successor
he
really
doesn
t
want
to
marry
between
ourselves
strictly
between
ourselves
he
regards
marriage
as
rather
a
bore
but
of
course
being
a
german
grand
duke
he
is
bound
to
marry
he
owes
it
to
his
country
to
how
large
is
posen
asked
racksole
bluntly
father
nella
interposed
laughing
you
shouldn
t
ask
such
inconvenient
questions
you
ought
to
have
guessed
that
it
isn
t
etiquette
to
inquire
about
the
size
of
a
german
i
am
sure
said
dimmock
with
a
polite
smile
that
the
grand
duke
is
as
much
amused
as
anyone
at
the
size
of
his
territory
i
forget
the
exact
acreage
but
i
remember
that
once
prince
aribert
and
myself
walked
across
it
and
back
again
in
a
single
then
the
grand
duke
can
not
travel
very
far
within
his
own
dominions
you
may
say
that
the
sun
does
set
on
his
empire
it
does
said
dimmock
unless
the
weather
is
cloudy
nella
put
in
is
the
grand
duke
content
always
to
stay
at
home
on
the
contrary
he
is
a
great
traveller
much
more
so
than
prince
aribert
i
may
tell
you
what
no
one
knows
at
present
outside
this
hotel
that
his
royal
highness
the
grand
duke
with
a
small
suite
will
be
here
in
london
asked
nella
in
this
hotel
oh
how
lovely
that
is
why
your
humble
servant
is
here
a
sort
of
advance
but
i
understood
racksole
said
that
you
were
er
attached
to
prince
aribert
the
i
am
prince
aribert
will
also
be
here
the
grand
duke
and
the
prince
have
business
about
important
investments
connected
with
the
grand
duke
s
marriage
settlement
in
the
highest
quarters
you
for
so
discreet
a
person
thought
racksole
you
are
fairly
then
he
said
aloud
shall
we
go
out
on
the
terrace
as
they
crossed
the
jules
stopped
mr
dimmock
and
handed
him
a
letter
just
come
sir
by
messenger
said
jules
nella
dropped
behind
for
a
second
with
her
father
leave
me
alone
with
this
boy
a
little
there
s
a
dear
parent
she
whispered
in
his
ear
i
am
a
mere
cypher
an
obedient
nobody
racksole
replied
pinching
her
arm
surreptitiously
treat
me
as
such
use
me
as
you
like
i
will
go
and
look
after
my
hotel
and
soon
afterwards
he
disappeared
nella
and
mr
dimmock
sat
together
on
the
terrace
sipping
iced
drinks
they
made
a
handsome
couple
bowered
amid
plants
which
blossomed
at
the
command
of
a
chelsea
wholesale
florist
people
who
passed
by
remarked
privately
that
from
the
look
of
things
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
romance
in
that
conversation
perhaps
there
was
but
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
character
of
nella
racksole
would
have
been
necessary
in
order
to
predict
what
precise
form
that
romance
would
take
jules
himself
served
the
liquids
and
at
ten
o
clock
he
brought
another
note
entreating
a
thousand
pardons
reginald
dimmock
after
he
had
glanced
at
the
note
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
urgent
business
for
his
serene
master
uncle
of
the
grand
duke
of
posen
he
asked
if
he
might
fetch
mr
racksole
or
escort
miss
racksole
to
her
father
but
miss
racksole
said
gaily
that
she
felt
no
need
of
an
escort
and
should
go
to
bed
she
added
that
her
father
and
herself
always
endeavoured
to
be
independent
of
each
other
just
then
theodore
racksole
had
found
his
way
once
more
into
mr
babylon
s
private
room
before
arriving
there
however
he
had
discovered
that
in
some
mysterious
manner
the
news
of
the
change
of
proprietorship
had
worked
its
way
down
to
the
lowest
strata
of
the
hotel
s
cosmos
the
corridors
hummed
with
it
and
even
were
to
be
seen
discussing
the
thing
just
as
though
it
mattered
to
them
have
a
cigar
mr
racksole
said
the
urbane
mr
babylon
and
a
mouthful
of
the
oldest
cognac
in
all
in
a
few
minutes
these
two
were
talking
eagerly
rapidly
felix
babylon
was
astonished
at
racksole
s
capacity
for
absorbing
the
details
of
hotel
management
and
as
for
racksole
he
soon
realized
that
felix
babylon
must
be
a
prince
of
hotel
managers
it
had
never
occurred
to
racksole
before
that
to
manage
an
hotel
even
a
large
hotel
could
be
a
specially
interesting
affair
or
that
it
could
make
any
excessive
demands
upon
the
brains
of
the
manager
but
he
came
to
see
that
he
had
underrated
the
possibilities
of
an
hotel
the
business
of
the
grand
babylon
was
enormous
it
took
racksole
with
all
his
genius
for
organization
exactly
half
an
hour
to
master
the
details
of
the
hotel
and
the
was
but
one
branch
of
activity
amid
scores
and
not
a
very
large
one
at
that
the
machinery
of
checking
supplies
and
of
establishing
a
mean
ratio
between
the
raw
stuff
received
in
the
kitchen
and
the
number
of
meals
served
in
the
salle
à
manger
and
the
private
rooms
was
very
complicated
and
delicate
when
racksole
had
grasped
it
he
at
once
suggested
some
improvements
and
this
led
to
a
long
theoretical
discussion
and
the
discussion
led
to
digressions
and
then
felix
babylon
in
a
moment
of
yawned
racksole
looked
at
the
gilt
clock
on
the
high
mantelpiece
great
scott
he
said
it
s
three
o
clock
mr
babylon
accept
my
apologies
for
having
kept
you
up
to
such
an
absurd
i
have
not
spent
so
pleasant
an
evening
for
many
years
you
have
let
me
ride
my
hobby
to
my
heart
s
content
it
is
i
who
should
racksole
rose
i
should
like
to
ask
you
one
question
said
babylon
have
you
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
hotels
before
never
said
racksole
then
you
have
missed
your
vocation
you
could
have
been
the
greatest
of
all
you
would
have
been
greater
than
me
and
i
am
unequalled
though
i
keep
only
one
hotel
and
some
men
have
half
a
dozen
mr
racksole
why
have
you
never
run
an
hotel
heaven
knows
he
laughed
but
you
flatter
me
mr
i
flatter
you
do
not
know
me
i
flatter
no
one
except
perhaps
now
and
then
an
exceptionally
distinguished
guest
in
which
case
i
give
suitable
instructions
as
to
the
speaking
of
distinguished
guests
i
am
told
that
a
couple
of
german
princes
are
coming
here
that
is
does
one
do
anything
does
one
receive
them
formally
stand
bowing
in
the
or
anything
of
that
sort
not
necessarily
not
unless
one
wishes
the
modern
hotel
proprietor
is
not
like
an
innkeeper
of
the
middle
ages
and
even
princes
do
not
expect
to
see
him
unless
something
should
happen
to
go
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
the
grand
duke
of
posen
and
prince
aribert
have
both
honoured
me
by
staying
here
before
i
have
never
even
set
eyes
on
them
you
will
find
all
arrangements
have
been
they
talked
a
little
longer
and
then
racksole
said
good
night
let
me
see
you
to
your
room
the
lifts
will
be
closed
and
the
place
will
be
deserted
as
for
myself
i
sleep
here
and
mr
babylon
pointed
to
an
inner
door
no
thanks
said
racksole
let
me
explore
my
own
hotel
unaccompanied
i
believe
i
can
discover
my
when
he
got
fairly
into
the
passages
racksole
was
not
so
sure
that
he
could
discover
his
own
room
the
number
was
but
he
had
forgotten
whether
it
was
on
the
first
or
second
floor
travelling
in
a
lift
one
is
unconscious
of
floors
he
passed
several
but
he
could
see
no
glint
of
a
staircase
in
all
respecting
hotels
staircases
have
gone
out
of
fashion
and
though
hotel
architects
still
continue
for
old
sakes
sake
to
build
staircases
they
are
tucked
away
in
remote
corners
where
their
presence
is
not
likely
to
offend
the
eye
of
a
spoiled
and
cosmopolitan
public
the
hotel
seemed
vast
uncanny
deserted
an
electric
light
glowed
here
and
there
at
long
intervals
on
the
thick
carpets
racksole
s
feet
made
no
sound
and
he
wandered
at
ease
to
and
fro
rather
amused
rather
struck
by
the
peculiar
senses
of
night
and
mystery
which
had
suddenly
come
over
him
he
fancied
he
could
hear
a
thousand
snores
peacefully
descending
from
the
upper
realms
at
length
he
found
a
staircase
a
very
dark
and
narrow
one
and
presently
he
was
on
the
first
floor
he
soon
discovered
that
the
numbers
of
the
rooms
on
this
floor
did
not
get
beyond
seventy
he
encountered
another
staircase
and
ascended
to
the
second
floor
by
the
decoration
of
the
walls
he
recognized
this
floor
as
his
proper
home
and
as
he
strolled
through
the
long
corridor
he
whistled
a
low
meditative
whistle
of
satisfaction
he
thought
he
heard
a
step
in
the
transverse
corridor
and
instinctively
he
obliterated
himself
in
a
recess
which
held
a
and
a
chair
he
did
hear
a
step
peeping
cautiously
out
he
perceived
what
he
had
not
perceived
previously
that
a
piece
of
white
ribbon
had
been
tied
round
the
handle
of
the
door
of
one
of
the
bedrooms
then
a
man
came
round
the
corner
of
the
transverse
corridor
and
racksole
drew
back
it
was
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
slouch
hat
over
his
eyes
but
in
other
respects
attired
as
usual
racksole
at
that
instant
remembered
with
a
special
vividness
what
felix
babylon
had
said
to
him
at
their
first
interview
he
wished
he
had
brought
his
revolver
he
didn
t
know
why
he
should
feel
the
desirability
of
a
revolver
in
a
london
hotel
of
the
most
unimpeachable
fair
fame
but
he
did
feel
the
desirability
of
such
an
instrument
of
attack
and
defence
he
privately
decided
that
if
jules
went
past
his
recess
he
would
take
him
by
the
throat
and
in
that
attitude
put
a
few
plain
questions
to
this
highly
dubious
waiter
but
jules
had
stopped
the
millionaire
made
another
cautious
observation
jules
with
infinite
gentleness
was
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
to
which
the
white
ribbon
was
attached
the
door
slowly
yielded
and
jules
disappeared
within
the
room
after
a
brief
interval
the
jules
reappeared
closed
the
door
as
softly
as
he
had
opened
it
removed
the
ribbon
returned
upon
his
steps
and
vanished
down
the
transverse
corridor
this
is
quaint
said
racksole
quaint
to
a
degree
it
occurred
to
him
to
look
at
the
number
of
the
room
and
he
stole
towards
it
well
i
m
d
d
he
murmured
wonderingly
the
number
was
his
daughter
s
room
he
tried
to
open
it
but
the
door
was
locked
rushing
to
his
own
room
no
he
seized
one
of
a
pair
of
revolvers
the
kind
that
are
made
for
millionaires
and
followed
after
jules
down
the
transverse
corridor
at
the
end
of
this
corridor
was
a
window
the
window
was
open
and
jules
was
innocently
gazing
out
of
the
window
ten
silent
strides
and
theodore
racksole
was
upon
him
one
word
my
friend
the
millionaire
began
carelessly
waving
the
revolver
in
the
air
jules
was
indubitably
startled
but
by
an
admirable
exercise
of
he
recovered
possession
of
his
faculties
in
a
second
sir
said
jules
i
just
want
to
be
informed
what
the
deuce
you
were
doing
in
no
a
moment
i
had
been
requested
to
go
there
was
the
calm
response
you
are
a
liar
and
not
a
very
clever
one
that
is
my
daughter
s
room
now
out
with
it
before
i
decide
whether
to
shoot
you
or
throw
you
into
the
excuse
me
sir
no
is
occupied
by
a
i
advise
you
that
it
is
a
serious
error
of
judgement
to
contradict
me
my
friend
don
t
do
it
again
we
will
go
to
the
room
together
and
you
shall
prove
that
the
occupant
is
a
gentleman
and
not
my
impossible
sir
said
jules
scarcely
that
said
racksole
and
he
took
jules
by
the
sleeve
the
millionaire
knew
for
a
certainty
that
nella
occupied
no
for
he
had
examined
the
room
with
her
and
himself
seen
that
her
trunks
and
her
maid
and
herself
had
arrived
there
in
safety
now
open
the
door
whispered
racksole
when
they
reached
i
must
that
is
just
what
you
mustn
t
do
open
it
no
doubt
you
have
your
confronted
by
the
revolver
jules
readily
obeyed
yet
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
as
though
he
would
not
be
responsible
for
this
outrage
against
the
decorum
of
hotel
life
racksole
entered
the
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
a
visitor
who
insists
on
seeing
you
sir
said
jules
and
fled
mr
reginald
dimmock
still
in
evening
dress
and
smoking
a
cigarette
rose
hurriedly
from
a
table
hello
my
dear
mr
racksole
this
is
an
unexpected
ah
where
is
my
daughter
this
is
her
did
i
catch
what
you
said
mr
racksole
i
venture
to
remark
that
this
is
miss
racksole
s
my
good
sir
answered
dimmock
you
must
be
mad
to
dream
of
such
a
thing
only
my
respect
for
your
daughter
prevents
me
from
expelling
you
forcibly
for
such
an
extraordinary
a
small
spot
down
the
bridge
of
the
millionaire
s
nose
turned
suddenly
white
with
your
permission
he
said
in
a
low
calm
voice
i
will
examine
the
and
the
just
listen
to
me
a
moment
dimmock
urged
in
a
milder
tone
i
ll
listen
to
you
afterwards
my
young
friend
said
racksole
and
he
proceeded
to
search
the
and
the
without
any
result
whatever
lest
my
attitude
might
be
open
to
misconstruction
mr
dimmock
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
have
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
my
daughter
who
is
as
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
as
any
woman
i
ever
met
but
since
you
entered
it
there
have
been
one
or
two
rather
mysterious
occurrences
in
this
hotel
that
is
feeling
a
draught
of
air
on
his
shoulder
racksole
turned
to
the
window
for
instance
he
added
i
perceive
that
this
window
is
broken
badly
broken
and
from
the
outside
now
how
could
that
have
occurred
if
you
will
kindly
hear
reason
mr
racksole
said
dimmock
in
his
best
diplomatic
manner
i
will
endeavour
to
explain
things
to
you
i
regarded
your
first
question
to
me
when
you
entered
my
room
as
being
offensively
put
but
i
now
see
that
you
had
some
he
smiled
politely
i
was
passing
along
this
corridor
about
eleven
o
clock
when
i
found
miss
racksole
in
a
difficulty
with
the
hotel
servants
miss
racksole
was
retiring
to
rest
in
this
room
when
a
large
stone
which
must
have
been
thrown
from
the
embankment
broke
the
window
as
you
see
apart
from
the
discomfort
of
the
broken
window
she
did
not
care
to
remain
in
the
room
she
argued
that
where
one
stone
had
come
another
might
follow
she
therefore
insisted
on
her
room
being
changed
the
servants
said
that
there
was
no
other
room
available
with
a
and
attached
and
your
daughter
made
a
point
of
these
matters
i
at
once
offered
to
exchange
apartments
with
her
she
did
me
the
honour
to
accept
my
offer
our
respective
belongings
were
moved
and
that
is
all
miss
racksole
is
at
this
moment
i
trust
asleep
in
no
theodore
racksole
looked
at
the
young
man
for
a
few
seconds
in
silence
there
was
a
faint
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
racksole
loudly
someone
pushed
open
the
door
but
remained
standing
on
the
mat
it
was
nella
s
maid
in
a
miss
racksole
s
compliments
and
a
thousand
excuses
but
a
book
of
hers
was
left
on
the
mantelshelf
in
this
room
she
can
not
sleep
and
wishes
to
mr
dimmock
i
tender
my
apologies
my
formal
apologies
said
racksole
when
the
girl
had
gone
away
with
the
book
good
pray
don
t
mention
it
said
dimmock
suavely
and
bowed
him
out
chapter
four
entrance
of
the
prince
nevertheless
sundry
small
things
weighed
on
racksole
s
mind
first
there
was
jules
wink
then
there
was
the
ribbon
on
the
and
jules
visit
to
no
and
the
broken
window
broken
from
the
outside
racksole
did
not
forget
that
the
time
was
he
slept
but
little
that
night
but
he
was
glad
that
he
had
bought
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
it
was
an
acquisition
which
seemed
to
promise
fun
and
diversion
the
next
morning
he
came
across
mr
babylon
early
i
have
emptied
my
private
room
of
all
personal
papers
said
babylon
and
it
is
now
at
your
disposal
i
purpose
if
agreeable
to
yourself
to
stay
on
in
the
hotel
as
a
guest
for
the
present
we
have
much
to
settle
with
regard
to
the
completion
of
the
purchase
and
also
there
are
things
which
you
might
want
to
ask
me
also
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
not
anxious
to
leave
the
old
place
with
too
much
suddenness
it
will
be
a
wrench
to
i
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
stay
said
the
millionaire
but
it
must
be
as
my
guest
not
as
the
guest
of
the
you
are
very
as
for
wishing
to
consult
you
no
doubt
i
shall
have
need
to
do
so
but
i
must
say
that
the
show
seems
to
run
ah
said
babylon
thoughtfully
i
have
heard
of
hotels
that
run
themselves
if
they
do
you
may
be
sure
that
they
obey
the
laws
of
gravity
and
run
downwards
you
will
have
your
hands
full
for
example
have
you
yet
heard
about
miss
spencer
no
said
racksole
what
of
her
she
has
mysteriously
vanished
during
the
night
and
nobody
appears
to
be
able
to
throw
any
light
on
the
affair
her
room
is
empty
her
boxes
gone
you
will
want
someone
to
take
her
place
and
that
someone
will
not
be
very
easy
to
h
m
racksole
said
after
a
pause
hers
is
not
the
only
post
that
falls
vacant
a
little
later
the
millionaire
installed
himself
in
the
late
owner
s
private
room
and
rang
the
bell
i
want
jules
he
said
to
the
page
while
waiting
for
jules
racksole
considered
the
question
of
miss
spencer
s
disappearance
good
morning
jules
was
his
cheerful
greeting
when
the
imperturbable
waiter
arrived
good
morning
take
a
thank
you
we
have
met
before
this
morning
yes
sir
at
rather
strange
about
miss
spencer
s
departure
is
it
not
suggested
racksole
it
is
remarkable
you
are
aware
of
course
that
mr
babylon
has
transferred
all
his
interests
in
this
hotel
to
me
i
have
been
informed
to
that
effect
i
suppose
you
know
everything
that
goes
on
in
the
hotel
jules
as
the
head
waiter
sir
it
is
my
business
to
keep
a
general
eye
on
you
speak
very
good
english
for
a
foreigner
for
a
foreigner
sir
i
am
an
englishman
a
hertfordshire
man
born
and
bred
perhaps
my
name
has
misled
you
sir
i
am
only
called
jules
because
the
head
waiter
of
any
really
hotel
must
have
either
a
french
or
an
italian
i
see
said
racksole
i
think
you
must
be
rather
a
clever
person
that
is
not
for
me
to
say
how
long
has
the
hotel
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
your
services
a
little
over
twenty
that
is
a
long
time
to
be
in
one
place
don
t
you
think
it
s
time
you
got
out
of
the
rut
you
are
still
young
and
might
make
a
reputation
for
yourself
in
another
and
wider
racksole
looked
at
the
man
steadily
and
his
glance
was
steadily
returned
you
aren
t
satisfied
with
me
sir
to
be
frank
jules
i
think
i
think
you
er
wink
too
much
and
i
think
that
it
is
regrettable
when
a
head
waiter
falls
into
a
habit
of
taking
white
ribbons
from
the
handles
of
bedroom
doors
at
three
in
the
jules
started
slightly
i
see
how
it
is
sir
you
wish
me
to
go
and
one
pretext
if
i
may
use
the
term
is
as
good
as
another
very
well
i
can
t
say
that
i
m
surprised
it
sometimes
happens
that
there
is
incompatibility
of
temper
between
a
hotel
proprietor
and
his
head
waiter
and
then
unless
one
of
them
goes
the
hotel
is
likely
to
suffer
i
will
go
mr
racksole
in
fact
i
had
already
thought
of
giving
the
millionaire
smiled
appreciatively
what
wages
do
you
require
in
lieu
of
notice
it
is
my
intention
that
you
leave
the
hotel
within
an
i
require
no
wages
in
lieu
of
notice
sir
i
would
scorn
to
accept
anything
and
i
will
leave
the
hotel
in
fifteen
then
you
have
my
good
wishes
and
my
admiration
so
long
as
you
keep
out
of
my
racksole
got
up
sir
and
thank
by
the
way
jules
it
will
be
useless
for
you
to
apply
to
any
other
european
hotel
for
a
post
because
i
shall
take
measures
which
will
ensure
the
rejection
of
any
such
without
discussing
the
question
whether
or
not
there
aren
t
at
least
half
a
dozen
hotels
in
london
alone
that
would
jump
for
joy
at
the
chance
of
getting
me
answered
jules
i
may
tell
you
sir
that
i
shall
retire
from
my
really
you
will
turn
your
brains
to
a
different
no
sir
i
shall
take
rooms
in
albemarle
street
or
jermyn
street
and
just
be
content
to
be
a
i
have
saved
some
twenty
thousand
pounds
a
mere
trifle
but
sufficient
for
my
needs
and
i
shall
now
proceed
to
enjoy
it
pardon
me
for
troubling
you
with
my
personal
affairs
and
that
afternoon
racksole
went
with
felix
babylon
first
to
a
firm
of
solicitors
in
the
city
and
then
to
a
stockbroker
in
order
to
carry
out
the
practical
details
of
the
purchase
of
the
hotel
i
mean
to
settle
in
england
said
racksole
as
they
were
coming
back
it
is
the
only
country
and
he
stopped
the
only
country
the
only
country
where
you
can
invest
money
and
spend
money
with
a
feeling
of
security
in
the
united
states
there
is
nothing
worth
spending
money
on
nothing
to
buy
in
france
or
italy
there
is
no
real
but
surely
you
are
a
true
american
questioned
babylon
i
am
a
true
american
said
racksole
but
my
father
who
began
by
being
a
bedmaker
at
an
oxford
college
and
ultimately
made
ten
million
dollars
out
of
iron
in
pittsburg
my
father
took
the
wise
precaution
of
having
me
educated
in
england
i
had
my
three
years
at
oxford
like
any
son
of
the
upper
middle
class
it
did
me
good
it
has
been
worth
more
to
me
than
many
successful
speculations
it
taught
me
that
the
english
language
is
different
from
and
better
than
the
american
language
and
that
there
is
something
i
haven
t
yet
found
out
exactly
what
in
english
life
that
americans
will
never
get
why
he
added
in
the
united
states
we
still
bribe
our
judges
and
our
newspapers
and
we
talk
of
the
eighteenth
century
as
though
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
world
yes
i
shall
transfer
my
securities
to
london
i
shall
build
a
house
in
park
lane
and
i
shall
buy
some
immemorial
country
seat
with
a
history
as
long
as
the
and
railroad
and
i
shall
calmly
and
gradually
settle
down
d
you
know
i
am
rather
a
man
for
a
millionaire
and
of
a
social
disposition
and
yet
i
haven
t
six
real
friends
in
the
whole
of
new
york
city
think
of
that
and
i
said
babylon
have
no
friends
except
the
friends
of
my
boyhood
in
lausanne
i
have
spent
thirty
years
in
england
and
gained
nothing
but
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
english
language
and
as
much
gold
coin
as
would
fill
a
rather
large
these
two
plutocrats
breathed
a
simultaneous
sigh
talking
of
gold
coin
said
racksole
how
much
money
should
you
think
jules
has
contrived
to
amass
while
he
has
been
with
you
oh
babylon
smiled
i
should
not
like
to
guess
he
has
had
unique
opportunities
should
you
consider
twenty
thousand
an
extraordinary
sum
under
the
circumstances
not
at
all
has
he
been
confiding
in
you
somewhat
i
have
dismissed
you
have
dismissed
him
why
not
there
is
no
reason
why
not
but
i
have
felt
inclined
to
dismiss
him
for
the
past
ten
years
and
never
found
courage
to
do
it
was
a
perfectly
simple
proceeding
i
assure
you
before
i
had
done
with
him
i
rather
liked
the
miss
spencer
and
jules
both
gone
in
one
day
mused
felix
babylon
and
no
one
to
take
their
places
said
racksole
and
yet
the
hotel
continues
its
way
but
when
racksole
reached
the
grand
babylon
he
found
that
miss
spencer
s
chair
in
the
bureau
was
occupied
by
a
stately
and
imperious
girl
dressed
becomingly
in
black
heavens
nella
he
cried
going
to
the
bureau
what
are
you
doing
here
i
am
taking
mis
spencer
s
place
i
want
to
help
you
with
your
hotel
dad
i
fancy
i
shall
make
an
excellent
hotel
clerk
i
have
arranged
with
a
miss
selina
smith
one
of
the
typists
in
the
office
to
put
me
up
to
all
the
tips
and
tricks
and
i
shall
do
very
but
look
here
helen
racksole
we
shall
have
the
whole
of
london
talking
about
this
thing
the
greatest
of
all
american
heiresses
a
hotel
clerk
and
i
came
here
for
quiet
and
rest
i
suppose
it
was
for
the
sake
of
quiet
and
rest
that
you
bought
the
hotel
papa
you
would
insist
on
the
steak
he
retorted
get
out
of
this
on
the
here
i
am
here
to
stay
said
nella
and
deliberately
laughed
at
her
parent
just
then
the
face
of
a
man
of
about
thirty
years
appeared
at
the
bureau
window
he
was
very
very
aristocratic
in
his
pose
and
he
seemed
rather
angry
he
looked
fixedly
at
nella
and
started
back
ach
he
exclaimed
you
yes
your
highness
it
is
indeed
i
father
this
is
his
serene
highness
prince
aribert
of
posen
one
of
our
most
esteemed
you
know
my
name
fräulein
the
murmured
in
german
certainly
prince
nella
replied
sweetly
you
were
plain
count
steenbock
last
spring
in
paris
doubtless
travelling
incognito
silence
he
entreated
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
his
forehead
went
as
white
as
paper
chapter
five
what
occurred
to
reginald
dimmock
in
another
moment
they
were
all
three
talking
quite
nicely
and
with
at
any
rate
an
appearance
of
being
natural
prince
aribert
became
suave
even
deferential
to
nella
and
more
friendly
towards
nella
s
father
than
their
respective
positions
demanded
the
latter
amused
himself
by
studying
this
sprig
of
royalty
the
first
with
whom
he
had
ever
come
into
contact
he
decided
that
the
young
fellow
was
personable
enough
had
no
frills
on
him
and
would
make
an
exceptionally
good
commercial
traveller
for
a
firm
such
was
theodore
racksole
s
preliminary
estimate
of
the
man
who
might
one
day
be
the
reigning
grand
duke
of
posen
it
occurred
to
nella
and
she
smiled
at
the
idea
that
the
bureau
of
the
hotel
was
scarcely
the
correct
place
in
which
to
receive
this
august
young
man
there
he
stood
with
his
head
through
the
bureau
window
negligently
leaning
against
the
woodwork
just
as
though
he
were
a
stockbroker
or
the
manager
of
a
new
york
burlesque
company
is
your
highness
travelling
quite
alone
she
asked
by
a
series
of
accidents
i
am
he
said
my
equerry
was
to
have
met
me
at
charing
cross
but
he
failed
to
do
so
i
can
not
imagine
mr
dimmock
questioned
racksole
yes
dimmock
i
do
not
remember
that
he
ever
missed
an
appointment
before
you
know
him
he
has
been
here
he
dined
with
us
last
night
said
racksole
on
nella
s
invitation
he
added
maliciously
but
we
have
seen
nothing
of
him
i
know
however
that
he
has
engaged
the
state
apartments
and
also
a
suite
adjoining
the
state
apartments
no
that
is
so
isn
t
it
nella
yes
papa
she
said
having
first
demurely
examined
a
ledger
your
highness
would
doubtless
like
to
be
conducted
to
your
room
apartments
i
then
nella
laughed
deliberately
at
the
prince
and
said
i
don
t
know
who
is
the
proper
person
to
conduct
you
and
that
s
a
fact
the
truth
is
that
papa
and
i
are
rather
raw
yet
in
the
hotel
line
you
see
we
only
bought
the
place
last
you
have
bought
the
hotel
exclaimed
the
prince
that
s
so
said
racksole
and
felix
babylon
has
gone
he
is
going
if
he
has
not
already
ah
i
see
said
the
prince
this
is
one
of
your
american
strokes
you
have
bought
to
sell
again
is
that
not
it
you
are
on
your
holidays
but
you
can
not
resist
making
a
few
thousands
by
way
of
relaxation
i
have
heard
of
such
we
sha
n
t
sell
again
prince
until
we
are
tired
of
our
bargain
sometimes
we
tire
very
quickly
and
sometimes
we
don
t
it
depends
eh
what
racksole
broke
off
suddenly
to
attend
to
a
servant
in
livery
who
had
quietly
entered
the
bureau
and
was
making
urgent
mysterious
signs
to
him
if
you
please
sir
the
man
by
frantic
gestures
implored
mr
theodore
racksole
to
come
out
pray
don
t
let
me
detain
you
mr
racksole
said
the
prince
and
therefore
the
proprietor
of
the
grand
babylon
departed
after
the
servant
with
a
queer
curt
little
bow
to
prince
aribert
mayn
t
i
come
inside
said
the
prince
to
nella
immediately
the
millionaire
had
gone
impossible
prince
nella
laughed
the
rule
against
visitors
entering
this
bureau
is
frightfully
how
do
you
know
the
rule
is
so
strict
if
you
only
came
into
possession
last
night
i
know
because
i
made
the
rule
myself
this
morning
your
but
seriously
miss
racksole
i
want
to
talk
to
do
you
want
to
talk
to
me
as
prince
aribert
or
as
the
friend
the
acquaintance
whom
i
knew
in
paris
last
year
as
the
friend
dear
lady
if
i
may
use
the
and
you
are
sure
that
you
would
not
like
first
to
be
conducted
to
your
apartments
not
yet
i
will
wait
till
dimmock
comes
he
can
not
fail
to
be
here
then
we
will
have
tea
served
in
father
s
private
room
the
proprietor
s
private
room
you
good
he
said
nella
talked
through
a
telephone
and
rang
several
bells
and
behaved
generally
in
a
manner
calculated
to
prove
to
princes
and
to
whomever
it
might
concern
that
she
was
a
young
woman
of
business
instincts
and
training
and
then
she
stepped
down
from
her
chair
of
office
emerged
from
the
bureau
and
preceded
by
two
menials
led
prince
aribert
to
the
louis
xv
chamber
in
which
her
father
and
felix
babylon
had
had
their
long
confabulation
on
the
previous
evening
what
do
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
she
asked
her
companion
as
she
poured
out
for
him
a
second
cup
of
tea
the
prince
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
he
took
the
proffered
cup
and
being
a
young
man
of
sane
healthy
instincts
he
could
think
of
nothing
for
the
moment
except
her
loveliness
nella
was
indeed
beautiful
that
afternoon
the
beauty
of
even
the
most
beautiful
woman
ebbs
and
flows
from
hour
to
hour
nella
s
this
afternoon
was
at
the
flood
vivacious
alert
imperious
and
yet
ineffably
sweet
she
seemed
to
radiate
the
very
joy
and
exuberance
of
life
i
have
forgotten
he
said
you
have
forgotten
that
is
surely
very
wrong
of
you
you
gave
me
to
understand
that
it
was
something
terribly
important
but
of
course
i
knew
it
couldn
t
be
because
no
man
and
especially
no
prince
ever
discussed
anything
really
important
with
a
recollect
miss
racksole
that
this
afternoon
here
i
am
not
the
you
are
count
steenbock
is
that
it
he
started
for
you
only
he
said
unconsciously
lowering
his
voice
miss
racksole
i
particularly
wish
that
no
one
here
should
know
that
i
was
in
paris
last
an
affair
of
state
she
smiled
an
affair
of
state
he
replied
soberly
even
dimmock
doesn
t
know
it
was
strange
that
we
should
be
fellow
guests
at
that
quiet
hotel
strange
but
delightful
i
shall
never
forget
that
rainy
afternoon
that
we
spent
together
in
the
museum
of
the
trocadéro
let
us
talk
about
about
the
rain
or
the
museum
i
shall
never
forget
that
afternoon
he
repeated
ignoring
the
lightness
of
her
question
nor
i
she
murmured
corresponding
to
his
mood
you
too
enjoyed
it
he
said
eagerly
the
sculptures
were
magnificent
she
replied
hastily
glancing
at
the
ceiling
ah
so
they
were
tell
me
miss
racksole
how
did
you
discover
my
i
must
not
say
she
answered
that
is
my
secret
do
not
seek
to
penetrate
it
who
knows
what
horrors
you
might
discover
if
you
probed
too
far
she
laughed
but
she
laughed
alone
the
prince
remained
pensive
as
it
were
brooding
i
never
hoped
to
see
you
again
he
said
why
not
one
never
sees
again
those
whom
one
wishes
to
as
for
me
i
was
perfectly
convinced
that
we
should
meet
why
because
i
always
get
what
i
then
you
wanted
to
see
me
again
certainly
you
interested
me
extremely
i
have
never
met
another
man
who
could
talk
so
well
about
sculpture
as
the
count
do
you
really
always
get
what
you
want
miss
racksole
of
that
is
because
your
father
is
so
rich
i
suppose
oh
no
it
isn
t
she
said
it
s
simply
because
i
always
do
get
what
i
want
it
s
got
nothing
to
do
with
father
at
but
mr
racksole
is
extremely
wealthy
wealthy
isn
t
the
word
count
there
is
no
word
it
s
positively
awful
the
amount
of
dollars
poor
papa
makes
and
the
worst
of
it
is
he
can
t
help
it
he
told
me
once
that
when
a
man
had
made
ten
millions
no
power
on
earth
could
stop
those
ten
millions
from
growing
into
twenty
and
so
it
continues
i
spend
what
i
can
but
i
can
t
come
near
coping
with
it
and
of
course
papa
is
no
use
whatever
at
and
you
have
no
mother
who
told
you
i
had
no
mother
she
asked
quietly
i
er
inquired
about
you
he
said
with
equal
candour
and
humility
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
you
never
hoped
to
see
me
again
yes
in
spite
of
how
funny
she
said
and
lapsed
into
a
meditative
silence
yours
must
be
a
wonderful
existence
said
the
prince
i
envy
you
envy
me
what
my
father
s
wealth
no
he
said
your
freedom
and
your
i
have
no
responsibilities
she
remarked
pardon
me
he
said
you
have
and
the
time
is
coming
when
you
will
feel
i
m
only
a
girl
she
murmured
with
sudden
simplicity
as
for
you
count
surely
you
have
sufficient
responsibilities
of
your
own
i
he
said
sadly
i
have
no
responsibilities
i
am
a
nobody
a
serene
highness
who
has
to
pretend
to
be
very
important
always
taking
immense
care
never
to
do
anything
that
a
serene
highness
ought
not
to
do
bah
but
if
your
nephew
prince
eugen
were
to
die
would
you
not
come
to
the
throne
and
would
you
not
then
have
these
responsibilities
which
you
so
much
desire
eugen
die
said
prince
aribert
in
a
curious
tone
impossible
he
is
the
perfection
of
health
in
three
months
he
will
be
married
no
i
shall
never
be
anything
but
a
serene
highness
the
most
despicable
of
god
s
but
what
about
the
state
secret
which
you
mentioned
is
not
that
a
responsibility
ah
he
said
that
is
over
that
belongs
to
the
past
it
was
an
accident
in
my
dull
career
i
shall
never
be
count
steenbock
who
knows
she
said
by
the
way
is
not
prince
eugen
coming
here
day
mr
dimmock
told
us
see
answered
the
prince
standing
up
and
bending
over
her
i
am
going
to
confide
in
you
i
don
t
know
why
but
i
don
t
betray
state
secrets
she
warned
him
smiling
into
his
face
but
just
then
the
door
of
the
room
was
unceremoniously
opened
go
right
in
said
a
voice
sharply
it
was
theodore
racksole
s
two
men
entered
bearing
a
prone
form
on
a
stretcher
and
racksole
followed
them
nella
sprang
up
racksole
stared
to
see
his
daughter
i
didn
t
know
you
were
in
here
nell
here
to
the
two
men
out
why
exclaimed
nella
gazing
fearfully
at
the
form
on
the
stretcher
it
s
mr
dimmock
it
is
her
father
acquiesced
he
s
dead
he
added
laconically
i
d
have
broken
it
to
you
more
gently
had
i
known
your
pardon
there
was
a
pause
dimmock
dead
prince
aribert
whispered
under
his
breath
and
he
kneeled
down
by
the
side
of
the
stretcher
what
does
this
mean
the
poor
fellow
was
just
walking
across
the
quadrangle
towards
the
portico
when
he
fell
down
a
commissionaire
who
saw
him
says
he
was
walking
very
quickly
at
first
i
thought
it
was
sunstroke
but
it
couldn
t
have
been
though
the
weather
certainly
is
rather
warm
it
must
be
heart
disease
but
anyhow
he
s
dead
we
did
what
we
could
i
ve
sent
for
a
doctor
and
for
the
police
i
suppose
there
ll
have
to
be
an
theodore
racksole
stopped
and
in
an
awkward
solemn
silence
they
all
gazed
at
the
dead
youth
his
features
were
slightly
drawn
and
his
eyes
closed
that
was
all
he
might
have
been
asleep
my
poor
dimmock
exclaimed
the
prince
his
voice
broken
and
i
was
angry
because
the
lad
did
not
meet
me
at
charing
cross
are
you
sure
he
is
dead
father
nella
said
you
d
better
go
away
nella
was
racksole
s
only
reply
but
the
girl
stood
still
and
began
to
sob
quietly
on
the
previous
night
she
had
secretly
made
fun
of
reginald
dimmock
she
had
deliberately
set
herself
to
get
information
from
him
on
a
topic
in
which
she
happened
to
be
specially
interested
and
she
had
got
it
laughing
the
while
at
his
youthful
crudities
his
vanity
his
transparent
cunning
his
absurd
airs
she
had
not
liked
him
she
had
even
distrusted
him
and
decided
that
he
was
not
nice
but
now
as
he
lay
on
the
stretcher
these
things
were
forgotten
she
went
so
far
as
to
reproach
herself
for
them
such
is
the
strange
commanding
power
of
death
oblige
me
by
taking
the
poor
fellow
to
my
apartments
said
the
prince
with
a
gesture
to
the
attendants
surely
it
is
time
the
doctor
racksole
felt
suddenly
at
that
moment
he
was
nothing
but
a
mere
hotel
proprietor
with
an
awkward
affair
on
his
hands
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
he
wished
he
had
never
bought
the
grand
babylon
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
prince
aribert
theodore
racksole
a
doctor
and
an
inspector
of
police
were
in
the
prince
s
they
had
just
come
from
an
in
which
lay
the
mortal
remains
of
reginald
dimmock
well
said
racksole
glancing
at
the
doctor
the
doctor
was
a
big
man
with
keen
quizzical
eyes
it
is
not
heart
disease
said
the
doctor
not
heart
disease
then
what
is
it
asked
the
prince
i
may
be
able
to
answer
that
question
after
the
said
the
doctor
i
certainly
can
t
answer
it
now
the
symptoms
are
unusual
to
a
the
inspector
of
police
began
to
write
in
a
chapter
six
in
the
gold
room
at
the
grand
babylon
a
great
ball
was
given
that
night
in
the
gold
room
a
huge
saloon
attached
to
the
hotel
though
scarcely
part
of
it
and
certainly
less
exclusive
than
the
hotel
itself
theodore
racksole
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
except
that
it
was
an
entertainment
offered
by
a
mr
and
mrs
sampson
levi
to
their
friends
who
mr
and
mrs
sampson
levi
were
he
did
not
know
nor
could
anyone
tell
him
anything
about
them
except
that
mr
sampson
levi
was
a
prominent
member
of
that
part
of
the
stock
exchange
familiarly
called
the
kaffir
circus
and
that
his
wife
was
a
stout
lady
with
an
aquiline
nose
and
many
diamonds
and
that
they
were
very
rich
and
very
hospitable
theodore
racksole
did
not
want
a
ball
in
his
hotel
that
evening
and
just
before
dinner
he
had
almost
a
mind
to
issue
a
decree
that
the
gold
room
was
to
be
closed
and
the
ball
forbidden
and
mr
and
mrs
sampson
levi
might
name
the
amount
of
damages
suffered
by
them
his
reasons
for
such
a
course
were
threefold
first
he
felt
depressed
and
uneasy
second
he
didn
t
like
the
name
of
sampson
levi
and
third
he
had
a
desire
to
show
these
plutocrats
that
their
wealth
was
nothing
to
him
that
they
could
not
do
what
they
chose
with
theodore
racksole
and
that
for
two
pins
theodore
racksole
would
buy
them
up
and
the
whole
kaffir
circus
to
boot
but
something
warned
him
that
though
such
a
proceeding
might
be
tolerated
in
america
that
land
of
freedom
it
would
never
be
tolerated
in
england
he
felt
instinctively
that
in
england
there
are
things
you
can
t
do
and
that
this
particular
thing
was
one
of
them
so
the
ball
went
forward
and
neither
mr
nor
mrs
sampson
levi
had
ever
the
least
suspicion
what
a
narrow
escape
they
had
had
of
looking
very
foolish
in
the
eyes
of
the
thousand
or
so
guests
invited
by
them
to
the
gold
room
of
the
grand
babylon
that
evening
the
gold
room
of
the
grand
babylon
was
built
for
a
ballroom
a
balcony
supported
by
arches
faced
with
gilt
and
ran
around
it
and
from
this
vantage
men
and
maidens
and
chaperons
who
could
not
or
would
not
dance
might
survey
the
scene
everyone
knew
this
and
most
people
took
advantage
of
it
what
everyone
did
not
know
what
no
one
knew
was
that
higher
up
than
the
balcony
there
was
a
little
barred
window
in
the
end
wall
from
which
the
hotel
authorities
might
keep
a
watchful
eye
not
only
on
the
dancers
but
on
the
occupants
of
the
balcony
itself
it
may
seem
incredible
to
the
uninitiated
that
the
guests
at
any
social
gathering
held
in
so
gorgeous
and
renowned
an
apartment
as
the
gold
room
of
the
grand
babylon
should
need
the
observation
of
a
watchful
eye
yet
so
it
was
strange
matters
and
unexpected
faces
had
been
descried
from
the
little
window
and
more
than
one
european
detective
had
kept
vigil
there
with
the
most
eminently
satisfactory
results
at
eleven
o
clock
theodore
racksole
afflicted
by
vexation
of
spirit
found
himself
gazing
idly
through
the
little
barred
window
nella
was
with
him
together
they
had
been
wandering
about
the
corridors
of
the
hotel
still
strange
to
them
both
and
it
was
quite
by
accident
that
they
had
lighted
upon
the
small
room
which
had
a
surreptitious
view
of
mr
and
mrs
sampson
levi
s
ball
except
for
the
light
of
the
chandelier
of
the
the
little
cubicle
was
in
darkness
nella
was
looking
through
the
window
her
father
stood
behind
i
wonder
which
is
mrs
sampson
levi
nella
said
and
whether
she
matches
her
name
wouldn
t
you
love
to
have
a
name
like
that
father
something
that
people
could
take
hold
of
instead
of
racksole
the
sound
of
violins
and
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
rose
gently
up
to
them
umphl
said
theodore
curse
those
evening
papers
he
added
inconsequently
but
with
sincerity
father
you
re
very
horrid
what
have
the
evening
papers
been
doing
well
my
young
madame
they
ve
got
me
in
for
one
and
you
for
another
and
they
re
manufacturing
mysteries
like
fun
it
s
young
dimmock
s
death
that
has
started
well
father
you
surely
didn
t
expect
to
keep
yourself
out
of
the
papers
besides
as
regards
newspapers
you
ought
to
be
glad
you
aren
t
in
new
york
just
fancy
what
the
dear
old
herald
would
have
made
out
of
a
little
transaction
like
yours
of
last
that
s
true
assented
racksole
but
it
ll
be
all
over
new
york
morrow
morning
all
the
same
the
worst
of
it
is
that
babylon
has
gone
off
to
why
don
t
know
sudden
fancy
i
guess
for
his
native
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
none
only
i
feel
sort
of
lonesome
i
feel
i
want
someone
to
lean
up
against
in
running
this
father
if
you
have
that
feeling
you
must
be
getting
yes
he
sighed
i
admit
it
s
unusual
with
me
but
perhaps
you
haven
t
grasped
the
fact
nella
that
we
re
in
the
middle
of
a
rather
queer
you
mean
about
poor
mr
dimmock
partly
dimmock
and
partly
other
things
first
of
all
that
miss
spencer
or
whatever
her
wretched
name
is
mysteriously
disappears
then
there
was
the
stone
thrown
into
your
bedroom
then
i
caught
that
rascal
jules
conspiring
with
dimmock
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
then
your
precious
prince
aribert
arrives
without
any
suite
which
i
believe
is
a
most
peculiar
and
wicked
thing
for
a
prince
to
do
and
moreover
i
find

very
intimate
terms

and

is
to
be
an
inquest

and
his
suite

were
expected
here
for
dinner

to
turn
up
at
all
prince
eugen

has
not
and
uncle
aribert
is
in
a
deuce
of
a
stew
about
him
and
telegraphing
all
over
europe
altogether
things
are
working
up
pretty
do
you
really
think
dad
there
was
anything
between
jules
and
poor
mr
dimmock
think
i
know
i
tell
you
i
saw
that
scamp
give
dimmock
a
wink
last
night
at
dinner
that
might
have
meant
well
so
you
caught
that
wink
did
you
dad
why
did
you
of
course
dad
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
the
millionaire
grunted
look
here
father
nella
whispered
suddenly
and
pointed
to
the
balcony
immediately
below
them
who
s
that
she
indicated
a
man
with
a
bald
patch
on
the
back
of
his
head
who
was
propping
himself
up
against
the
railing
of
the
balcony
and
gazing
immovable
into
the
well
who
is
it
isn
t
it
jules
gemini
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
it
is
perhaps
mr
jules
is
a
guest
of
mrs
sampson
guest
or
no
guest
he
goes
out
of
this
hotel
even
if
i
have
to
throw
him
out
theodore
racksole
disappeared
without
another
word
and
nella
followed
him
but
when
the
millionaire
arrived
on
the
balcony
floor
he
could
see
nothing
of
jules
neither
there
nor
in
the
itself
saying
no
word
aloud
but
quietly
whispering
wicked
expletives
he
searched
everywhere
in
vain
and
then
at
last
by
tortuous
stairways
and
corridors
returned
to
his
original
post
of
observation
that
he
might
survey
the
place
anew
from
the
vantage
ground
to
his
surprise
he
found
a
man
in
the
dark
little
room
watching
the
scene
of
the
ball
as
intently
as
he
himself
had
been
doing
a
few
minutes
before
hearing
footsteps
the
man
turned
with
a
start
it
was
jules
the
two
exchanged
glances
in
the
half
light
for
a
second
good
evening
mr
racksole
said
jules
calmly
i
must
apologize
for
being
force
of
habit
i
suppose
said
theodore
racksole
drily
just
so
i
fancied
i
had
forbidden
you
to
this
hotel
i
thought
your
order
applied
only
to
my
professional
capacity
i
am
here
as
the
guest
of
mr
and
mrs
sampson
in
your
new
rôle
of
eh
but
i
don
t
allow
up
here
my
for
being
up
here
i
have
already
then
having
apologized
you
had
better
depart
that
is
my
disinterested
advice
to
good
night
and
i
say
mr
jules
if
mr
and
mrs
sampson
levi
or
any
other
hebrews
or
christians
should
again
invite
you
to
my
hotel
you
will
oblige
me
by
declining
the
invitation
you
ll
find
that
will
be
the
safest
course
for
good
night
before
midnight
struck
theodore
racksole
had
ascertained
that
the
of
mr
and
mrs
sampson
levi
though
a
somewhat
lengthy
one
contained
no
reference
to
any
such
person
as
jules
he
sat
up
very
late
to
be
precise
he
sat
up
all
night
he
was
a
man
who
by
dint
of
training
could
comfortably
dispense
with
sleep
when
he
felt
so
inclined
or
when
circumstances
made
such
a
course
advisable
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
room
and
cogitated
as
few
people
beside
theodore
racksole
could
cogitate
at
he
took
a
stroll
round
the
business
part
of
his
premises
and
watched
the
supplies
come
in
from
covent
garden
from
smithfield
from
billingsgate
and
from
other
strange
places
he
found
the
proceedings
of
the
kitchen
department
quite
interesting
and
made
mental
notes
of
things
that
he
would
have
altered
of
men
whose
wages
he
would
increase
and
men
whose
wages
he
would
reduce
at
he
happened
to
be
standing
near
the
luggage
lift
and
witnessed
the
descent
of
vast
quantities
of
luggage
and
its
disappearance
into
a
carter
paterson
van
whose
luggage
is
that
he
inquired
peremptorily
the
luggage
clerk
with
an
aggrieved
expression
explained
to
him
that
it
was
the
luggage
of
nobody
in
particular
that
it
belonged
to
various
guests
and
was
bound
for
various
destinations
that
it
was
in
fact
expressed
luggage
despatched
in
advance
and
that
a
similar
quantity
of
it
left
the
hotel
every
morning
about
that
hour
theodore
racksole
walked
away
and
breakfasted
upon
one
cup
of
tea
and
half
a
slice
of
toast
at
ten
o
clock
he
was
informed
that
the
inspector
of
police
desired
to
see
him
the
inspector
had
come
he
said
to
superintend
the
removal
of
the
body
of
reginald
dimmock
to
the
mortuary
adjoining
the
place
of
inquest
and
a
suitable
vehicle
waited
at
the
back
entrance
of
the
hotel
the
inspector
had
also
brought
subpoenas
for
himself
and
prince
aribert
of
posen
and
the
commissionaire
to
attend
the
inquest
i
thought
mr
dimmock
s
remains
were
removed
last
night
said
racksole
wearily
no
sir
the
fact
is
the
van
was
engaged
on
another
the
inspector
gave
the
least
hint
of
a
professional
smile
and
racksole
disgusted
told
him
curtly
to
go
and
perform
his
duties
in
a
few
minutes
a
message
came
from
the
inspector
requesting
mr
racksole
to
be
good
enough
to
come
to
him
on
the
first
floor
racksole
went
in
the
where
the
body
of
reginald
dimmock
had
originally
been
placed
were
the
inspector
and
prince
aribert
and
two
policemen
well
said
racksole
after
he
and
the
prince
had
exchanged
bows
then
he
saw
a
coffin
laid
across
two
chairs
i
see
a
coffin
has
been
obtained
he
remarked
quite
right
he
approached
it
it
s
empty
he
observed
unthinkingly
just
so
said
the
inspector
the
body
of
the
deceased
has
disappeared
and
his
serene
highness
prince
aribert
informs
me
that
though
he
has
occupied
a
room
immediately
opposite
on
the
other
side
of
the
corridor
he
can
throw
no
light
on
the
indeed
i
can
not
said
the
prince
and
though
he
spoke
with
sufficient
calmness
and
dignity
you
could
see
that
he
was
deeply
pained
even
distressed
well
i
m
murmured
racksole
and
stopped
chapter
seven
nella
and
the
prince
it
appeared
impossible
to
theodore
racksole
that
so
cumbrous
an
article
as
a
corpse
could
be
removed
out
of
his
hotel
with
no
trace
no
hint
no
clue
as
to
the
time
or
the
manner
of
the
performance
of
the
deed
after
the
first
feeling
of
surprise
racksole
grew
coldly
and
severely
angry
he
had
a
mind
to
dismiss
the
entire
staff
of
the
hotel
he
personally
examined
the
the
chambermaids
and
all
other
persons
who
by
chance
might
or
ought
to
know
something
of
the
affair
but
without
avail
the
corpse
of
reginald
dimmock
had
vanished
utterly
disappeared
like
a
fleshless
spirit
of
course
there
were
the
police
but
theodore
racksole
held
the
police
in
sorry
esteem
he
acquainted
them
with
the
facts
answered
their
queries
with
a
patient
weariness
and
expected
nothing
whatever
from
that
quarter
he
also
had
several
interviews
with
prince
aribert
of
posen
but
though
the
prince
was
suavity
itself
and
beyond
doubt
genuinely
concerned
about
the
fate
of
his
dead
attendant
yet
it
seemed
to
racksole
that
he
was
keeping
something
back
that
he
hesitated
to
say
all
he
knew
racksole
with
characteristic
insight
decided
that
the
death
of
reginald
dimmock
was
only
a
minor
event
which
had
occurred
as
it
were
on
the
fringe
of
some
far
more
profound
mystery
and
therefore
he
decided
to
wait
with
his
eyes
very
wide
open
until
something
else
happened
that
would
throw
light
on
the
business
at
the
moment
he
took
only
one
measure
he
arranged
that
the
theft
of
dimmock
s
body
should
not
appear
in
the
newspapers
it
is
astonishing
how
well
a
secret
can
be
kept
when
the
possessors
of
the
secret
are
handled
with
the
proper
mixture
of
firmness
and
persuasion
racksole
managed
this
very
neatly
it
was
a
complicated
job
and
his
success
in
it
rather
pleased
him
at
the
same
time
he
was
conscious
of
being
temporarily
worsted
by
an
unknown
group
of
schemers
in
which
he
felt
convinced
that
jules
was
an
important
item
he
could
scarcely
look
nella
in
the
eyes
the
girl
had
evidently
expected
him
to
unmask
this
conspiracy
at
once
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
millionaire
s
magic
wand
she
was
thoroughly
accustomed
in
the
land
of
her
birth
to
seeing
him
achieve
impossible
feats
over
there
he
was
a
boss
men
trembled
before
his
name
when
he
wished
a
thing
to
happen
well
it
happened
if
he
desired
to
know
a
thing
he
just
knew
it
but
here
in
london
theodore
racksole
was
not
quite
the
same
theodore
racksole
he
dominated
new
york
but
london
for
the
most
part
seemed
not
to
take
much
interest
in
him
and
there
were
certainly
various
persons
in
london
who
were
capable
of
snapping
their
fingers
at
him
at
theodore
racksole
neither
he
nor
his
daughter
could
get
used
to
that
fact
as
for
nella
she
concerned
herself
for
a
little
with
the
ordinary
business
of
the
bureau
and
watched
the
incomings
and
outgoings
of
prince
aribert
with
a
kindly
interest
she
perceived
what
her
father
had
failed
to
perceive
that
his
highness
had
assumed
an
attitude
of
reserve
merely
to
hide
the
secret
distraction
and
dismay
which
consumed
him
she
saw
that
the
poor
fellow
had
no
settled
plan
in
his
head
and
that
he
was
troubled
by
something
which
so
far
he
had
confided
to
nobody
it
came
to
her
knowledge
that
each
morning
he
walked
to
and
fro
on
the
victoria
embankment
alone
and
apparently
with
no
object
on
the
third
morning
she
decided
that
driving
exercise
on
the
embankment
would
be
good
for
her
health
and
thereupon
ordered
a
carriage
and
issued
forth
arrayed
in
a
miraculous
gown
near
blackfriars
bridge
she
met
the
prince
and
the
carriage
was
drawn
up
by
the
pavement
good
morning
prince
she
greeted
him
are
you
mistaking
this
for
hyde
park
he
bowed
and
smiled
i
usually
walk
here
in
the
mornings
he
said
you
surprise
me
she
returned
i
thought
i
was
the
only
person
in
london
who
preferred
the
embankment
with
this
view
of
the
river
to
the
dustiness
of
hyde
park
i
can
t
imagine
how
it
is
that
london
will
never
take
exercise
anywhere
except
in
that
ridiculous
park
now
if
they
had
central
park
i
think
the
embankment
is
the
finest
spot
in
all
london
he
said
she
leaned
a
little
out
of
the
landau
bringing
her
face
nearer
to
his
i
do
believe
we
are
kindred
spirits
you
and
i
she
murmured
and
then
au
revoir
prince
one
moment
miss
his
quick
tones
had
a
note
of
entreaty
i
am
in
a
hurry
she
fibbed
i
am
not
merely
taking
exercise
this
morning
you
have
no
idea
how
busy
we
ah
then
i
will
not
trouble
you
but
i
leave
the
grand
babylon
do
you
she
said
then
will
your
highness
do
me
the
honour
of
lunching
with
me
today
in
father
s
room
father
will
be
out
he
is
having
a
day
in
the
city
with
some
stockbroking
i
shall
be
charmed
said
the
prince
and
his
face
showed
that
he
meant
it
nella
drove
off
if
the
lunch
was
a
success
that
result
was
due
partly
to
rocco
and
partly
to
nella
the
prince
said
little
beyond
what
the
ordinary
rules
of
the
conversational
game
demanded
his
hostess
talked
much
and
talked
well
but
she
failed
to
rouse
her
guest
when
they
had
had
coffee
he
took
a
rather
formal
leave
of
her
prince
she
said
but
i
thought
that
is
no
i
didn
t
you
thought
i
wished
to
discuss
something
with
you
i
did
but
i
have
decided
that
i
have
no
right
to
burden
your
mind
with
my
but
suppose
suppose
i
wish
to
be
burdened
that
is
your
good
sit
down
she
said
abruptly
and
tell
me
everything
mind
everything
i
adore
almost
before
he
knew
it
he
was
talking
to
her
rapidly
eagerly
why
should
i
weary
you
with
my
confidences
he
said
i
don
t
know
i
can
not
tell
but
i
feel
that
i
must
i
feel
that
you
will
understand
me
better
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
and
yet
why
should
you
understand
me
again
i
don
t
know
miss
racksole
i
will
disclose
to
you
the
whole
trouble
in
a
word
prince
eugen
the
hereditary
grand
duke
of
posen
has
disappeared
four
days
ago
i
was
to
have
met
him
at
ostend
he
had
affairs
in
london
he
wished
me
to
come
with
him
i
sent
dimmock
on
in
front
and
waited
for
eugen
he
did
not
arrive
i
telegraphed
back
to
cologne
his
last
and
i
learned
that
he
had
left
there
in
accordance
with
his
programme
i
learned
also
that
he
had
passed
through
brussels
it
must
have
been
between
brussels
and
the
railway
station
at
ostend
quay
that
he
disappeared
he
was
travelling
with
a
single
equerry
and
the
equerry
too
has
vanished
i
need
not
explain
to
you
miss
racksole
that
when
a
person
of
the
importance
of
my
nephew
contrives
to
get
lost
one
must
proceed
cautiously
one
can
not
advertise
for
him
in
the
london
times
such
a
disappearance
must
be
kept
secret
the
people
at
posen
and
at
berlin
believe
that
eugen
is
in
london
here
at
this
hotel
or
rather
they
did
so
believe
but
this
morning
i
received
a
cypher
telegram
from
from
his
majesty
the
emperor
a
very
peculiar
telegram
asking
when
eugen
might
be
expected
to
return
to
posen
and
requesting
that
he
should
go
first
to
berlin
that
telegram
was
addressed
to
myself
now
if
the
emperor
thought
that
eugen
was
here
why
should
he
have
caused
the
telegram
to
be
addressed
to
me
i
have
hesitated
for
three
days
but
i
can
hesitate
no
longer
i
must
myself
go
to
the
emperor
and
acquaint
him
with
the
i
suppose
you
ve
just
got
to
keep
straight
with
him
nella
was
on
the
point
of
saying
but
she
checked
herself
and
substituted
the
emperor
is
your
chief
is
he
not
first
among
equals
you
call
his
majesty
is
our
said
aribert
quietly
why
do
you
not
take
immediate
steps
to
inquire
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
your
royal
nephew
she
asked
simply
the
affair
seemed
to
her
just
then
so
plain
and
straightforward
because
one
of
two
things
may
have
happened
either
eugen
may
have
been
in
plain
language
abducted
or
he
may
have
had
his
own
reasons
for
changing
his
programme
and
keeping
in
the
background
out
of
reach
of
telegraph
and
post
and
what
sort
of
reasons
do
not
ask
me
in
the
history
of
every
family
there
are
passages
he
stopped
and
what
was
prince
eugen
s
object
in
coming
to
london
aribert
hesitated
money
he
said
at
length
as
a
family
we
are
very
poor
poorer
than
anyone
in
berlin
prince
aribert
nella
said
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
looked
at
him
out
of
eyes
his
pale
thin
distinguished
face
held
her
gaze
as
if
by
some
fascination
there
could
be
no
mistaking
this
man
for
anything
else
but
a
prince
if
you
will
he
said
prince
eugen
is
the
victim
of
a
you
think
so
i
am
perfectly
convinced
of
but
why
what
can
be
the
object
of
a
plot
against
him
that
is
a
point
of
which
you
should
know
more
than
me
she
remarked
drily
ah
perhaps
perhaps
he
said
but
dear
miss
racksole
why
are
you
so
sure
there
are
several
reasons
and
they
are
connected
with
mr
dimmock
did
you
ever
suspect
your
highness
that
that
poor
young
man
was
not
entirely
loyal
to
you
he
was
absolutely
loyal
said
the
prince
with
all
the
earnestness
of
conviction
a
thousand
pardons
but
he
was
miss
racksole
if
any
other
than
yourself
made
that
assertion
i
would
consign
them
to
the
deepest
dungeon
in
posen
she
laughed
lightly
and
she
told
him
of
the
incidents
which
had
occurred
in
the
night
preceding
his
arrival
in
the
hotel
do
you
mean
miss
racksole
that
there
was
an
understanding
between
poor
dimmock
and
this
fellow
jules
there
was
an
impossible
your
highness
the
man
who
wishes
to
probe
a
mystery
to
its
root
never
uses
the
word
impossible
but
i
will
say
this
for
young
mr
dimmock
i
think
he
repented
and
i
think
that
it
was
because
he
repented
that
he
er
died
so
suddenly
and
that
his
body
was
spirited
why
has
no
one
told
me
these
things
before
aribert
exclaimed
princes
seldom
hear
the
truth
she
said
he
was
astonished
at
her
coolness
her
firmness
of
assertion
her
air
of
complete
acquaintance
with
the
world
miss
racksole
he
said
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
it
i
have
never
in
my
life
met
a
woman
like
you
may
i
rely
on
your
sympathy
your
support
my
support
prince
but
how
i
do
not
know
he
replied
but
you
could
help
me
if
you
would
a
woman
when
she
has
brain
always
has
more
brain
than
a
ah
she
said
ruefully
i
have
no
brains
but
i
do
believe
i
could
help
what
prompted
her
to
make
that
assertion
she
could
not
have
explained
even
to
herself
but
she
made
it
and
she
had
a
suspicion
a
it
would
be
justified
though
by
what
means
through
what
good
fortune
was
still
a
mystery
to
her
go
to
berlin
she
said
i
see
that
you
must
do
that
you
have
no
alternative
as
for
the
rest
we
shall
see
something
will
occur
i
shall
be
here
my
father
will
be
here
you
must
count
us
as
your
he
kissed
her
hand
when
he
left
and
afterwards
when
she
was
alone
she
kissed
the
spot
his
lips
had
touched
again
and
again
now
thinking
the
matter
out
in
the
calmness
of
solitude
all
seemed
strange
unreal
uncertain
to
her
were
conspiracies
actually
possible
nowadays
did
queer
things
actually
happen
in

did
they

night

she
said

about
their
interview
chapter
eight
arrival
and
departure
of
the
baroness
on
the
following
morning
just
before
lunch
a
lady
accompanied
by
a
maid
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
luggage
came
to
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
she
was
a
plump
little
old
lady
with
white
hair
and
an
fashioned
bonnet
and
she
had
a
quaint
simple
smile
of
surprise
at
everything
in
general
nevertheless
she
gave
the
impression
of
belonging
to
some
aristocracy
though
not
the
english
aristocracy
her
tone
to
her
maid
whom
she
addressed
in
broken
english
the
girl
being
apparently
english
was
distinctly
insolent
with
the
calm
unconscious
insolence
peculiar
to
a
certain
type
of
continental
nobility
the
name
on
the
lady
s
card
ran
thus
baroness
zerlinski
she
desired
rooms
on
the
third
floor
it
happened
that
nella
was
in
the
bureau
on
the
third
floor
madam
questioned
nella
in
her
best
clerkly
manner
i
did
say
on
de
tird
floor
said
the
plump
little
old
lady
we
have
accommodation
on
the
second
i
wish
to
be
high
up
out
of
de
dust
and
in
de
light
explained
the
baroness
we
have
no
suites
on
the
third
floor
never
mind
no
mattaire
have
you
not
two
rooms
that
communicate
nella
consulted
her
books
rather
awkwardly
numbers
and
or
is
it
and
the
little
old
lady
remarked
quickly
and
then
bit
her
lip
i
beg
your
pardon
i
should
have
said
and
at
the
moment
nella
regarded
the
baroness
s
correction
of
her
figures
as
a
curious
chance
but
afterwards
when
the
baroness
had
ascended
in
the
lift
the
thing
struck
her
as
somewhat
strange
perhaps
the
baroness
zerlinski
had
stayed
at
the
hotel
before
for
the
sake
of
convenience
an
index
of
visitors
to
the
hotel
was
kept
and
the
index
extended
back
for
thirty
years
nella
examined
it
but
it
did
not
contain
the
name
of
zerlinski
then
it
was
that
nella
began
to
imagine
what
had
swiftly
crossed
her
mind
when
first
the
baroness
presented
herself
at
the
bureau
that
the
features
of
the
baroness
were
remotely
familiar
to
her
she
thought
not
that
she
had
seen
the
old
lady
s
face
before
but
that
she
had
seen
somewhere
some
time
a
face
of
a
similar
cast
it
occurred
to
nella
to
look
at
the
almanach
de
gotha
that
record
of
all
the
mazes
of
continental
blue
blood
but
the
almanach
de
gotha
made
no
reference
to
any
barony
of
zerlinski
nella
inquired
where
the
baroness
meant
to
take
lunch
and
was
informed
that
a
table
had
been
reserved
for
her
in
the
and
she
at
once
decided
to
lunch
in
the
room
herself
seated
in
a
corner
by
a
pillar
she
could
survey
all
the
guests
and
watch
each
group
as
it
entered
or
left
presently
the
baroness
appeared
dressed
in
black
with
a
tiny
lace
shawl
despite
the
june
warmth
very
stately
very
quaint
and
gently
smiling
nella
observed
her
intently
the
lady
ate
heartily
working
without
haste
and
without
delay
through
the
elaborate
menu
of
the
luncheon
nella
noticed
that
she
had
beautiful
white
teeth
then
a
remarkable
thing
happened
a
cream
puff
was
served
to
the
baroness
by
way
of
sweets
and
nella
was
astonished
to
see
the
little
lady
remove
the
top
and
with
a
spoon
quietly
take
something
from
the
interior
which
looked
like
a
piece
of
folded
paper
no
one
who
had
not
been
watching
with
the
eye
of
a
lynx
would
have
noticed
anything
extraordinary
in
the
action
indeed
the
chances
were
nine
hundred
and
to
one
that
it
would
pass
unheeded
but
unfortunately
for
the
baroness
it
was
the
thousandth
chance
that
happened
nella
jumped
up
and
walking
over
to
the
baroness
said
to
her
i
m
afraid
that
the
tart
is
not
quite
nice
your
thanks
it
is
delightful
said
the
baroness
coldly
her
smile
had
vanished
who
are
you
i
thought
you
were
de
bureau
my
father
is
the
owner
of
this
hotel
i
thought
there
was
something
in
the
tart
which
ought
not
to
have
been
nella
looked
the
baroness
full
in
the
face
the
piece
of
folded
paper
to
which
a
little
cream
had
attached
itself
lay
under
the
edge
of
a
plate
no
the
baroness
smiled
her
simple
smile
nella
departed
she
had
noticed
one
trifling
thing
besides
the
paper
namely
that
the
baroness
could
pronounce
the
english
th
sound
if
she
chose
that
afternoon
in
her
own
room
nella
sat
meditating
at
the
window
for
long
time
and
then
she
suddenly
sprang
up
her
eyes
brightening
i
know
she
exclaimed
clapping
her
hands
it
s
miss
spencer
disguised
why
didn
t
i
think
of
that
before
her
thoughts
ran
instantly
to
prince
aribert
perhaps
i
can
help
him
she
said
to
herself
and
gave
a
little
sigh
she
went
down
to
the
office
and
inquired
whether
the
baroness
had
given
any
instructions
about
dinner
she
felt
that
some
plan
must
be
formulated
she
wanted
to
get
hold
of
rocco
and
put
him
in
the
rack
she
knew
now
that
rocco
the
unequalled
was
also
concerned
in
this
mysterious
affair
the
baroness
zerlinski
has
left
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
said
the
attendant
but
she
only
arrived
this
the
baroness
s
maid
said
that
her
mistress
had
received
a
telegram
and
must
leave
at
once
the
baroness
paid
the
bill
and
went
away
in
a
where
to
the
trunks
were
labelled
for
perhaps
it
was
instinct
perhaps
it
was
the
mere
spirit
of
adventure
but
that
evening
nella
was
to
be
seen
of
all
men
on
the
steamer
for
ostend
which
leaves
dover
at
she
told
no
one
of
her
intentions
not
even
her
father
who
was
not
in
the
hotel
when
she
left
she
had
scribbled
a
brief
note
to
him
to
expect
her
back
in
a
day
or
two
and
had
posted
this
at
dover
the
steamer
was
the
marie
henriette
a
large
and
luxurious
boat
whose
on
deck
vie
with
the
glories
of
the
cunard
and
white
star
liners
one
of
these
the
best
was
evidently
occupied
for
every
curtain
of
its
windows
was
carefully
drawn
nella
did
not
hope
that
the
baroness
was
on
board
it
was
quite
possible
for
the
baroness
to
have
caught
the
eight
o
clock
steamer
and
it
was
also
possible
for
the
baroness
not
to
have
gone
to
ostend
at
all
but
to
some
other
place
in
an
entirely
different
direction
nevertheless
nella
had
a
faint
hope
that
the
lady
who
called
herself
zerlinski
might
be
in
that
curtained
stateroom
and
throughout
the
smooth
moonlit
voyage
she
never
once
relaxed
her
observation
of
its
doors
and
its
windows
the
maria
henriette
arrived
in
ostend
harbour
punctually
at
in
the
morning
there
was
the
usual
heterogeneous
gesticulating
crowd
on
the
quay
nella
kept
her
post
near
the
door
of
the
and
at
length
she
was
rewarded
by
seeing
it
open
four
englishmen
issued
from
it
from
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
nella
saw
that
they
had
spent
the
voyage
in
it
would
not
be
too
much
to
say
that
she
was
distinctly
annoyed
she
pretended
to
be
annoyed
with
circumstances
but
really
she
was
annoyed
with
nella
racksole
at
two
in
the
morning
without
luggage
without
any
companionship
and
without
a
plan
of
campaign
she
found
herself
in
a
strange
foreign
port
a
port
of
evil
repute
possessing
some
of
the
hotels
in
europe
she
strolled
on
the
quay
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
she
saw
the
smoke
of
another
steamer
in
the
offing
she
inquired
from
an
official
what
that
steamer
might
be
and
was
told
that
it
was
the
eight
o
clock
from
dover
which
had
broken
down
put
into
calais
for
some
slight
necessary
repairs
and
was
arriving
at
its
destination
nearly
four
hours
late
her
mercurial
spirits
rose
again
a
minute
ago
she
was
regarding
herself
as
no
better
than
a
ninny
engaged
in
a
chase
now
she
felt
that
after
all
she
had
been
very
sagacious
and
cunning
she
was
morally
sure
that
she
would
find
the
zerlinski
woman
on
this
second
steamer
and
she
took
all
the
credit
to
herself
in
advance
such
is
human
nature
the
steamer
seemed
interminably
slow
in
coming
into
harbour
nella
walked
on
the
digue
for
a
few
minutes
to
watch
it
the
better
the
town
was
silent
and
almost
deserted
it
had
a
false
and
sinister
aspect
she
remembered
tales
which
she
had
heard
of
this
glittering
resort
which
in
the
season
holds
more
scoundrels
than
any
place
in
europe
save
only
monte
carlo
she
remembered
that
the
gilded
adventurers
of
every
nation
under
the
sun
forgathered
there
either
for
business
or
pleasure
and
that
some
of
the
most
wonderful
crimes
of
the
latter
half
of
the
century
had
been
schemed
and
matured
in
that
haunt
of
cosmopolitan
iniquity
when
the
second
steamer
arrived
nella
stood
at
the
end
of
the
gangway
close
to
the
the
first
person
to
step
on
shore
was
not
the
baroness
zerlinski
but
miss
spencer
herself
nella
turned
aside
instantly
hiding
her
face
and
miss
spencer
carrying
a
small
bag
hurried
with
assured
footsteps
to
the
custom
house
it
seemed
as
if
she
knew
the
port
of
ostend
fairly
well
the
moon
shone
like
day
and
nella
had
full
opportunity
to
observe
her
quarry
she
could
see
now
quite
plainly
that
the
baroness
zerlinski
had
been
only
miss
spencer
in
disguise
there
was
the
same
gait
the
same
movement
of
the
head
and
of
the
hips
the
white
hair
was
easily
to
be
accounted
for
by
a
wig
and
the
wrinkles
by
a
paint
brush
and
some
grease
paints
miss
spencer
whose
hair
was
now
its
old
accustomed
yellow
got
through
the
custom
house
without
difficulty
and
nella
saw
her
call
a
closed
carriage
and
say
something
to
the
driver
the
vehicle
drove
off
nella
jumped
into
the
next
carriage
an
open
one
that
came
up
follow
that
carriage
she
said
succinctly
to
the
driver
in
french
bien
madame
the
driver
whipped
up
his
horse
and
the
animal
shot
forward
with
a
terrific
clatter
over
the
cobbles
it
appeared
that
this
driver
was
quite
accustomed
to
following
other
carriages
now
i
am
fairly
in
for
it
said
nella
to
herself
she
laughed
unsteadily
but
her
heart
was
beating
with
an
extraordinary
thump
for
some
time
the
pursued
vehicle
kept
well
in
front
it
crossed
the
town
nearly
from
end
to
end
and
plunged
into
a
maze
of
small
streets
far
on
the
south
side
of
the
kursaal
then
gradually
nella
s
equipage
began
to
overtake
it
the
first
carriage
stopped
with
a
jerk
before
a
tall
dark
house
and
miss
spencer
emerged
nella
called
to
her
driver
to
stop
but
he
determined
to
be
in
at
the
death
was
engaged
in
whipping
his
horse
and
he
completely
ignored
her
commands
he
drew
up
triumphantly
at
the
tall
dark
house
just
at
the
moment
when
miss
spencer
disappeared
into
it
the
other
carriage
drove
away
nella
uncertain
what
to
do
stepped
down
from
her
carriage
and
gave
the
driver
some
money
at
the
same
moment
a
man
reopened
the
door
of
the
house
which
had
closed
on
miss
spencer
i
want
to
see
miss
spencer
said
nella
impulsively
she
couldn
t
think
of
anything
else
to
say
miss
spencer
yes
she
s
just
it
s
i
suppose
said
the
man
i
guess
so
said
nella
and
she
walked
past
him
into
the
house
she
was
astonished
at
her
own
audacity
miss
spencer
was
just
going
into
a
room
off
the
narrow
hall
nella
followed
her
into
the
apartment
which
was
shabbily
furnished
in
the
belgian
style
well
miss
spencer
she
greeted
the
former
baroness
zerlinski
i
guess
you
didn
t
expect
to
see
me
you
left
our
hotel
very
suddenly
this
afternoon
and
you
left
it
very
suddenly
a
few
days
ago
and
so
i
ve
just
called
to
make
a
few
to
do
the
lady
justice
miss
spencer
bore
the
surprising
ordeal
very
well
she
did
not
flinch
she
betrayed
no
emotion
the
sole
sign
of
perturbation
was
in
her
hurried
breathing
you
have
ceased
to
be
the
baroness
zerlinski
nella
continued
may
i
sit
down
certainly
sit
down
said
miss
spencer
copying
the
girl
s
tone
you
are
a
fairly
smart
young
woman
that
i
will
say
what
do
you
want
weren
t
my
books
all
straight
your
books
were
all
straight
i
haven
t
come
about
your
books
i
have
come
about
the
murder
of
reginald
dimmock
the
disappearance
of
his
corpse
and
the
disappearance
of
prince
eugen
of
posen
i
thought
you
might
be
able
to
help
me
in
some
investigations
which
i
am
miss
spencer
s
eyes
gleamed
and
she
stood
up
and
moved
swiftly
to
the
mantelpiece
you
may
be
a
yankee
but
you
re
a
fool
she
said
she
took
hold
of
the
don
t
ring
that
bell
if
you
value
your
life
said
nella
if
what
miss
spencer
remarked
if
you
value
your
life
said
nella
calmly
and
with
the
words
she
pulled
from
her
pocket
a
very
neat
and
dainty
little
revolver
chapter
nine
two
women
and
the
revolver
you
you
re
only
doing
that
to
frighten
me
stammered
miss
spencer
in
a
low
quavering
voice
am
i
nella
replied
as
firmly
as
she
could
though
her
hand
shook
violently
with
excitement
could
miss
spencer
but
have
observed
it
am
i
you
said
just
now
that
i
might
be
a
yankee
girl
but
i
was
a
fool
well
i
am
a
yankee
girl
as
you
call
it
and
in
my
country
if
they
don
t
teach
in

at
least
a
lot
of
girls
who
can
handle
a
revolver

happen
to
be
one
of
them
i
tell
you
that
if
you
ring
that
bell
you
will
most
of
this
was
simple
bluff
on
nella
s
part
and
she
trembled
lest
miss
spencer
should
perceive
that
it
was
simple
bluff
happily
for
her
miss
spencer
belonged
to
that
order
of
women
who
have
every
sort
of
courage
except
physical
courage
miss
spencer
could
have
withstood
successfully
any
moral
trial
but
persuade
her
that
her
skin
was
in
danger
and
she
would
succumb
nella
at
once
divined
this
useful
fact
and
proceeded
accordingly
hiding
the
strangeness
of
her
own
sensations
as
well
as
she
could
you
had
better
sit
down
now
said
nella
and
i
will
ask
you
a
few
and
miss
spencer
obediently
sat
down
rather
white
and
trying
to
screw
her
lips
into
a
formal
smile
why
did
you
leave
the
grand
babylon
that
night
nella
began
her
examination
putting
on
a
stern
expression
i
had
orders
to
miss

miss
spencer
showed
a
sign
of
tears
nella
fingered
the
revolver
and
put
it
at
full
cock
well
she
repeated
why
did
he
want
you
to
leave
she
was
tremendously
surprised
at
her
own
coolness
and
somewhat
pleased
with
it
too
i
can
t
tell
you
i
can
t
tell
you

just
got
to
nella

in
a
terrible

tone

some
sort
of
business

money
and

mr
dimmock
in
this
business
i
fancy

miss
racksole
i

that
i
did
your
husband
and
mr
dimmock
have
a
quarrel
that
night
in
room
they
had
some
and
the
result
of
that
was
that
you
came
to
ostend
instantly
yes
i
suppose
and
what
were
you
to
do
in
ostend
what
were
your
instructions
from
this
husband
of
yours
miss
spencer
s
head
dropped
on
her
arms
on
the
table
which
separated
her
from
nella
and
she
appeared
to
sob
violently
have
pity
on
me
she
murmured
i
can
t
tell
you
any
why
he
d
kill
me
if
he
you
re
wandering
from
the
subject
observed
nella
coldly
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
warn
you
let
me
tell
you
plainly
i
ve
got
the
best
reasons
for
being
desperate
and
if
anything
happens
to
you
i
shall
say
i
did
it
in
now
what
were
you
to
do
in
ostend
i
shall
die
for
this
anyhow
whined
miss
spencer
and
then
with
a
sort
of
fierce
despair
i
had
to
keep
watch
on
prince
where
in
this
house
miss
spencer
nodded
and
looking
up
nella
could
see
the
traces
of
tears
in
her
face
then
prince
eugen
was
a
prisoner
some
one
had
captured
him
at
the
instigation
of
jules
yes
if
you
must
have
why
was
it
necessary
for
you
specially
to
come
to
ostend
oh
tom
trusts
me
you
see
i
know
ostend
before
i
took
that
place
at
the
grand
babylon
i
had
travelled
over
europe
and
tom
knew
that
i
knew
a
thing
or
why
did
you
take
the
place
at
the
grand
babylon
because
tom
told
me
to
he
said
i
should
be
useful
to
him
is
your
husband
an
anarchist
or
something
of
that
kind
miss
spencer
i
don
t
know
i
d
tell
you
in
a
minute
if
i
knew
but
he
s
one
of
those
that
keep
themselves
to
do
you
know
if
he
has
ever
committed
a
murder
never
said
miss
spencer
with
righteous
repudiation
of
the
mere
idea
but
mr
dimmock
was
murdered
he
was
poisoned
if
he
had
not
been
poisoned
why
was
his
body
stolen
it
must
have
been
stolen
to
prevent
inquiry
to
hide
traces
tell
me
about
i
take
my
dying
oath
said
miss
spencer
standing
up
a
little
way
from
the
table
i
take
my
dying
oath
i
didn
t
know
mr
dimmock
was
dead
till
i
saw
it
in
the
you
swear
you
had
no
suspicion
of
it
i
swear
i
hadn
nella
was
inclined
to
believe
the
statement
the
woman
and
the
girl
looked
at
each
other
in
the
tawdry
frowsy
room
miss
spencer
nervously
patted
her
yellow
hair
into
shape
as
if
gradually
recovering
her
composure
and
equanimity
the
whole
affair
seemed
like
a
dream
to
nella
a
disturbing
sinister
nightmare
she
was
a
little
uncertain
what
to
say
she
felt
that
she
had
not
yet
got
hold
of
any
very
definite
information
where
is
prince
eugen
now
she
asked
at
length
i
don
t
know
he
isn
t
in
this
house
no
ah
we
will
see
they
took
him
away
miss
who
took
him
away
some
of
your
husband
s
friends
some
of
his
then
there
is
a
gang
of
you
a
gang
of
us
a
gang
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
miss
spencer
quavered
oh
but
you
must
know
smiled
nella
calmly
you
can
t
possibly
be
so
innocent
as
all
that
mrs
tom
jackson
you
can
t
play
games
with
me
you
ve
just
got
to
remember
that
i
m
what
you
call
a
yankee
girl
there
s
one
thing
that
i
mean
to
find
out
within
the
next
five
minutes
and
that
is
how
your
charming
husband
kidnapped
prince
eugen
and
why
he
kidnapped
him
let
us
begin
with
the
second
question
you
have
evaded
it
miss
spencer
looked
into
nella
s
face
and
then
her
eyes
dropped
and
her
fingers
worked
nervously
with
the
tablecloth
how
can
i
tell
you
she
said
when
i
don
t
know
you
ve
got
the
hand
of
me
and
you
re
tormenting
me
for
your
own
she
wore
an
expression
of
persecuted
innocence
did
mr
tom
jackson
want
to
get
some
money
out
of
prince
eugen
money
not
he
tom
s
never
short
of
but
i
mean
a
lot
of
money
tens
of
thousands
hundreds
of
thousands
tom
never
wanted
money
from
anyone
said
miss
spencer
doggedly
then
had
he
some
reason
for
wishing
to
prevent
prince
eugen
from
coming
to
london
perhaps
he
had
i
don
t
know
if
you
kill
me
i
don
t
nella
stopped
to
reflect
then
she
raised
the
revolver
it
was
a
mechanical
unintentional
sort
of
action
and
certainly
she
had
no
intention
of
using
the
weapon
but
strange
to
say
miss
spencer
again
cowered
before
it
even
at
that
moment
nella
wondered
that
a
woman
like
miss
spencer
could
be
so
simple
as
to
think
the
revolver
would
actually
be
used
having
absolutely
no
physical
cowardice
herself
nella
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
imagining
that
other
people
could
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
bodily
fear
still
she
saw
her
advantage
and
used
it
relentlessly
and
with
as
much
theatrical
gesture
as
she
could
command
she
raised
the
revolver
till
it
was
level
with
miss
spencer
s
face
and
suddenly
a
new
queer
feeling
took
hold
of
her
she
knew
that
she
would
indeed
use
that
revolver
now
if
the
miserable
woman
before
her
drove
her
too
far
she
felt
afraid
afraid
of
herself
she
was
in
the
grasp
of
a
savage
primeval
instinct
in
a
flash
she
saw
miss
spencer
dead
at
her
feet
the
police
a
court
of
justice
the
scaffold
it
was
horrible
speak
she
said
hoarsely
and
miss
spencer
s
face
went
whiter
tom
did
say
the
woman
whispered
rapidly
awesomely
that
if
prince
eugen
got
to
london
it
would
upset
his
what
scheme
what
scheme
answer
heaven
help
me
i
don
t
miss
spencer
sank
into
a
chair
he
said
mr
dimmock
had
turned
tail
and
he
should
have
to
settle
him
and
then
rocco
rocco
what
about
rocco
nella
could
scarcely
hear
herself
her
grip
of
the
revolver
tightened
miss
spencer
s
eyes
opened
wider
she
gazed
at
nella
with
a
glassy
stare
don
t
ask
me
it
s
death
her
eyes
were
fixed
as
if
in
horror
it
is
said
nella
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
seemed
to
her
to
issue
from
the
lips
of
some
third
person
it
s
death
repeated
miss
spencer
and
gradually
her
head
and
shoulders
sank
back
and
hung
loosely
over
the
chair
nella
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
revulsion
the
woman
had
surely
fainted
dropping
the
revolver
she
ran
round
the
table
she
was
herself
again
feminine
sympathetic
the
old
nella
she
felt
immensely
relieved
that
this
had
happened
but
at
the
same
instant
miss
spencer
sprang
up
from
the
chair
like
a
cat
seized
the
revolver
and
with
a
wild
movement
of
the
arm
flung
it
against
the
window
it
crashed
through
the
glass
exploding
as
it
went
and
there
was
a
tense
silence
i
told
you
that
you
were
a
fool
remarked
miss
spencer
slowly
coming
here
like
a
sort
of
female
jack
sheppard
and
trying
to
get
the
best
of
me
we
are
on
equal
terms
now
you
frightened
me
but
i
knew
i
was
a
cleverer
woman
than
you
and
that
in
the
end
if
i
kept
on
long
enough
i
should
win
now
it
will
be
my
dumbfounded
and
overcome
with
a
miserable
sense
of
the
truth
of
miss
spencer
s
words
nella
stood
still
the
idea
of
her
colossal
foolishness
swept
through
her
like
a
flood
she
felt
almost
ashamed
but
even
at
this
juncture
she
had
no
fear
she
faced
the
woman
bravely
her
mind
leaping
about
in
search
of
some
plan
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
a
bribe
an
enormous
bribe
i
admit
you
ve
won
she
said
but
i
ve
not
finished
yet
just
miss
spencer
folded
her
arms
and
glanced
at
the
door
smiling
bitterly
you
know
my
father
is
a
millionaire
perhaps
you
know
that
he
is
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
world
if
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
not
to
reveal
anything
that
you
ve
told
me
what
will
you
take
to
let
me
go
free
what
sum
do
you
suggest
asked
miss
spencer
carelessly
twenty
thousand
pounds
said
nella
promptly
she
had
begun
to
regard
the
affair
as
a
business
operation
miss
spencer
s
lip
curled
a
hundred
again
miss
spencer
s
lip
curled
well
say
a
million
i
can
rely
on
my
father
and
so
may
you
think
you
are
worth
a
million
to
him
i
do
said
nella
and
you
think
we
could
trust
you
to
see
that
it
was
paid
of
course
you
and
we
should
not
suffer
afterwards
in
any
way
i
would
give
you
my
word
and
my
father
s
bah
exclaimed
miss
spencer
how
do
you
know
i
wouldn
t
let
you
go
free
for
nothing
you
are
only
a
rash
silly
i
know
you
wouldn
t
i
can
read
your
face
too
you
are
right
miss
spencer
replied
slowly
i
wouldn
t
i
wouldn
t
let
you
go
for
all
the
dollars
in
nella
felt
cold
down
the
spine
and
sat
down
again
in
her
chair
a
draught
of
air
from
the
broken
window
blew
on
her
cheek
steps
sounded
in
the
passage
the
door
opened
but
nella
did
not
turn
round
she
could
not
move
her
eyes
from
miss
spencer
s
there
was
a
noise
of
rushing
water
in
her
ears
she
lost
consciousness
and
slipped
limply
to
the
ground
chapter
ten
at
sea
it
seemed
to
nella
that
she
was
being
rocked
gently
in
a
vast
cradle
which
swayed
to
and
fro
with
a
motion
at
once
slow
and
incredibly
gentle
this
sensation
continued
for
some
time
and
there
was
added
to
it
the
sound
of
a
quick
quiet
muffled
beat
soft
exhilarating
breezes
wafted
her
forward
in
spite
of
herself
and
yet
she
remained
in
a
delicious
calm
she
wondered
if
her
mother
was
kneeling
by
her
side
whispering
some
lullaby
in
her
childish
ears
then
strange
colours
swam
before
her
eyes
her
eyelids
wavered
and
at
last
she
awoke
for
a
few
moments
her
gaze
travelled
to
and
fro
in
a
vain
search
for
some
clue
to
her
surroundings
was
aware
of
nothing
except
sense
of
repose
and
a
feeling
of
relief
that
some
mighty
and
fatal
struggle
was
over
she
cared
not
whether
she
had
conquered
or
suffered
defeat
in
the
struggle
of
her
soul
with
some
other
soul
it
was
finished
done
with
and
the
consciousness
of
its
conclusion
satisfied
and
contented
her
gradually
her
brain
recovering
from
its
obsession
began
to
grasp
the
phenomena
of
her
surroundings
and
she
saw
that
she
was
on
a
yacht
and
that
the
yacht
was
moving
the
motion
of
the
cradle
was
the
smooth
rolling
of
the
vessel
the
beat
was
the
beat
of
its
screw
the
strange
colours
were
the
cloud
tints
thrown
by
the
sun
as
it
rose
over
a
distant
and
receding
shore
in
the
wake
of
the
yacht
her
mother
s
lullaby
was
the
crooned
song
of
the
man
at
the
wheel
nella
all
through
her
life
had
had
many
experiences
of
yachting
from
the
waters
of
the
river
hudson
to
those
bluer
tides
of
the
mediterranean
sea
she
had
yachted
in
all
seasons
and
all
weathers
she
loved
the
water
and
now
it
seemed
deliciously
right
and
proper
that
she
should
be
on
the
water
again
she
raised
her
head
to
look
round
and
then
let
it
sink
back
she
was
fatigued
enervated
she
desired
only
solitude
and
calm
she
had
no
care
no
anxiety
no
responsibility
a
hundred
years
might
have
passed
since
her
meeting
with
miss
spencer
and
the
memory
of
that
meeting
appeared
to
have
faded
into
the
remotest
background
of
her
mind
it
was
a
small
yacht
and
her
practised
eye
at
once
told
that
it
belonged
to
the
highest
aristocracy
of
pleasure
craft
as
she
reclined
in
the
it
did
not
occur
to
her
at
that
moment
to
speculate
as
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
had
led
her
therein
she
examined
all
visible
details
of
the
vessel
the
deck
was
as
white
and
smooth
as
her
own
hand
and
the
seams
ran
along
its
length
like
blue
veins
all
the
from
the
band
round
the
slender
funnel
to
the
concave
surface
of
the
binnacle
shone
like
gold
the
tapered
masts
stretched
upwards
at
a
rakish
angle
and
the
rigging
seemed
like
spun
silk
no
sails
were
set
the
yacht
was
under
steam
and
doing
about
seven
or
eight
knots
she
judged
that
it
was
a
boat
of
a
hundred
tons
or
so
probably
and
not
more
than
two
or
three
years
old
no
one
was
to
be
seen
on
deck
except
the
man
at
the
wheel
this
man
wore
a
blue
jersey
but
there
was
neither
name
nor
initial
on
the
jersey
nor
was
there
a
name
on
the
white
lashed
to
the
main
rigging
nor
on
the
polished
dinghy
which
hung
on
the
starboard
davits
she
called
to
the
man
and
called
again
in
a
feeble
voice
but
the
steerer
took
no
notice
of
her
and
continued
his
quiet
song
as
though
nothing
else
existed
in
the
universe
save
the
yacht
the
sea
the
sun
and
himself
then
her
eyes
swept
the
outline
of
the
land
from
which
they
were
hastening
and
she
could
just
distinguish
a
lighthouse
and
a
great
white
irregular
dome
which
she
recognized
as
the
kursaal
at
ostend
that
gorgeous
rival
of
the
gaming
palace
at
monte
carlo
so
she
was
leaving
ostend
the
rays
of
the
sun
fell
on
her
caressingly
like
a
restorative
all
around
the
water
was
changing
from
wonderful
greys
and
dark
blues
to
still
more
wonderful
pinks
and
translucent
unearthly
greens
the
magic
kaleidoscope
of
dawn
was
going
forward
in
its
accustomed
way
regardless
of
the
vicissitudes
of
mortals
here
and
there
in
the
distance
she
descried
a
sail
the
brown
sail
of
some
ostend
returning
home
after
a
night
s
trawling
then
the
beat
of
paddles
caught
her
ear
and
a
steamer
blundered
past
wallowing
clumsily
among
the
waves
like
a
tortoise
it
was
the
swallow
from
london
she
could
see
some
of
its
passengers
leaning
curiously
over
the
a
girl
in
a
mackintosh
signalled
to
her
and
mechanically
she
answered
the
salute
with
her
arm
the
officer
of
the
bridge
of
the
swallow
hailed
the
yacht
but
the
man
at
the
wheel
offered
no
reply
in
another
minute
the
swallow
was
nothing
but
a
blot
in
the
distance
nella
tried
to
sit
straight
in
the
but
she
found
herself
unable
to
do
so
throwing
off
the
rug
which
covered
her
she
discovered
that
she
had
been
tied
to
the
chair
by
means
of
a
piece
of
broad
webbing
instantly
she
was
alert
awake
angry
she
knew
that
her
perils
were
not
over
she
felt
that
possibly
they
had
scarcely
yet
begun
her
lazy
contentment
her
dreamy
sense
of
peace
and
repose
vanished
utterly
and
she
steeled
herself
to
meet
the
dangers
of
a
grave
and
difficult
situation
just
at
that
moment
a
man
came
up
from
below
he
was
a
man
of
forty
or
so
clad
in
irreproachable
blue
with
a
peaked
yachting
cap
he
raised
the
cap
politely
good
morning
he
said
beautiful
sunrise
isn
t
it
the
clever
and
calculated
insolence
of
his
tone
cut
her
like
a
lash
as
she
lay
bound
in
the
chair
like
all
people
who
have
lived
easy
and
joyous
lives
in
those
fair
regions
where
gold
smoothes
every
crease
and
law
keeps
a
tight
hand
on
disorder
she
found
it
hard
to
realize
that
there
were
other
regions
where
gold
was
useless
and
law
without
power
hours
ago
she
would
have
declared
it
impossible
that
such
an
experience
as
she
had
suffered
could
happen
to
anyone
she
would
have
talked
airily
about
civilization
and
the
nineteenth
century
and
progress
and
the
police
but
her
experience
was
teaching
her
that
human
nature
remains
always
the
same
and
that
beneath
the
thin
crust
of
security
on
which
we
good
citizens
exist
the
dark
and
secret
forces
of
crime
continue
to
move
just
as
they
did
in
the
days
when
you
couldn
t
go
from
cheapside
to
chelsea
without
being
set
upon
by
thieves
her
experience
was
in
a
fair
way
to
teach
her
this
lesson
better
than
she
could
have
learnt
it
even
in
the
bureaux
of
the
detective
police
of
paris
london
and
st
petersburg
good
morning
the
man
repeated
and
she
glanced
at
him
with
a
sullen
angry
gaze
you
she
exclaimed
you
mr
thomas
jackson
if
that
is
your
name
loose
me
from
this
chair
and
i
will
talk
to
her
eyes
flashed
as
she
spoke
and
the
contempt
in
them
added
mightily
to
her
beauty
mr
thomas
jackson
otherwise
jules
erstwhile
head
waiter
at
the
grand
babylon
considered
himself
a
connoisseur
in
feminine
loveliness
and
the
vision
of
nella
racksole
smote
him
like
an
exquisite
blow
with
pleasure
he
replied
i
had
forgotten
that
to
prevent
you
from
falling
i
had
secured
you
to
the
chair
and
with
a
quick
movement
he
unfastened
the
band
nella
stood
up
quivering
with
fiery
annoyance
and
scorn
now
she
said
fronting
him
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
you
fainted
he
replied
imperturbably
perhaps
you
don
t
the
man
offered
her
a
with
a
characteristic
gesture
nella
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
in
spite
of
herself
that
the
fellow
had
distinction
an
air
of
breeding
no
one
would
have
guessed
that
for
twenty
years
he
had
been
an
hotel
waiter
his
long
lithe
figure
and
easy
careless
carriage
seemed
to
be
the
figure
and
carriage
of
an
aristocrat
and
his
voice
was
quiet
restrained
and
authoritative
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
being
carried
off
in
this
yacht
of
it
is
not
my
yacht
he
said
but
that
is
a
minor
detail
as
to
the
more
important
matter
forgive
me
that
i
remind
you
that
only
a
few
hours
ago
you
were
threatening
a
lady
in
my
house
with
a
then
it
was
your
house
why
not
may
i
not
possess
a
house
he
smiled
i
must
request
you
to
put
the
yacht
about
at
once
instantly
and
take
me
she
tried
to
speak
firmly
ah
he
said
i
am
afraid
that
s
impossible
i
didn
t
put
out
to
sea
with
the
intention
of
returning
at
once
in
the
last
words
he
gave
a
faint
imitation
of
her
tone
when
i
do
get
back
she
said
when
my
father
gets
to
know
of
this
affair
it
will
be
an
exceedingly
bad
day
for
you
mr
but
supposing
your
father
doesn
t
hear
of
it
what
supposing
you
never
get
back
do
you
mean
then
to
have
my
murder
on
your
conscience
talking
of
murder
he
said
you
came
very
near
to
murdering
my
friend
miss
spencer
at
least
so
she
tells
is
miss
spencer
on
board
nella
asked
seeing
perhaps
a
faint
ray
of
hope
in
the
possible
presence
of
a
woman
miss
spencer
is
not
on
board
there
is
no
one
on
board
except
you
and
myself
and
a
small
crew
a
very
discreet
crew
i
may
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
you
must
take
your
own
thanks
for
the
permission
he
said
i
will
send
you
up
some
he
went
to
the
saloon
stairs
and
whistled
and
a
negro
boy
appeared
with
a
tray
of
chocolate
nella
took
it
and
without
the
slightest
hesitation
threw
it
overboard
mr
jackson
walked
away
a
few
steps
and
then
returned
you
have
spirit
he
said
and
i
admire
spirit
it
is
a
rare
she
made
no
reply
why
did
you
mix
yourself
up
in
my
affairs
at
all
he
went
on
again
she
made
no
reply
but
the
question
set
her
thinking
why
had
she
mixed
herself
up
in
this
mysterious
business
it
was
quite
at
variance
with
the
usual
methods
of
her
gay
and
butterfly
existence
to
meddle
at
all
with
serious
things
had
she
acted
merely
from
a
desire
to
see
justice
done
and
wickedness
punished
or
was
it
the
desire
of
adventure
or
was
it
perhaps
the
desire
to
be
of
service
to
his
serene
highness
prince
aribert
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
that
you
are
in
this
fix
jules
continued
i
didn
t
bring
you
into
it
you
brought
yourself
into
it
you
and
your
father
you
have
been
moving
along
at
a
pace
which
is
rather
too
that
remains
to
be
seen
she
put
in
coldly
it
does
he
admitted
and
i
repeat
that
i
can
t
help
admiring
you
that
is
when
you
aren
t
interfering
with
my
private
affairs
that
is
a
proceeding
which
i
have
never
tolerated
from
anyone
not
even
from
a
millionaire
nor
even
from
a
beautiful
he
bowed
i
will
tell
you
what
i
propose
to
do
i
propose
to
escort
you
to
a
place
of
safety
and
to
keep
you
there
till
my
operations
are
concluded
and
the
possibility
of
interference
entirely
removed
you
spoke
just
now
of
murder
what
a
crude
notion
that
was
of
yours
it
is
only
the
amateur
who
practises
murder
what
about
reginald
dimmock
she
interjected
quickly
he
paused
gravely
reginald
dimmock
he
repeated
i
had
imagined
his
was
a
case
of
heart
disease
let
me
send
you
up
some
more
chocolate
i
m
sure
you
re
i
will
starve
before
i
touch
your
food
she
said
gallant
creature
he
murmured
and
his
eyes
roved
over
her
face
her
superb
supercilious
beauty
overcame
him
ah
he
said
what
a
wife
you
would
make
he
approached
nearer
to
her
you
and
i
miss
racksole
your
beauty
and
wealth
and
my
brains
we
could
conquer
the
world
few
men
are
worthy
of
you
but
i
am
one
of
the
few
listen
you
might
do
worse
marry
me
i
am
a
great
man
i
shall
be
greater
i
adore
you
marry
me
and
i
will
save
your
life
all
shall
be
well
i
will
begin
again
the
past
shall
be
as
though
there
had
been
no
this
is
somewhat
sudden
jules
she
said
with
biting
contempt
did
you
expect
me
to
be
conventional
he
retorted
i
love
granted
she
said
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
then
what
will
occur
to
your
present
wife
my
present
wife
yes
miss
spencer
as
she
is
she
told
you
i
was
her
husband
incidentally
she
she
isn
perhaps
she
isn
t
but
nevertheless
i
think
i
won
t
marry
nella
stood
like
a
statue
of
scorn
before
him
he
went
still
nearer
to
her
give
me
a
kiss
then
one
kiss
i
won
t
ask
for
more
one
kiss
from
those
lips
and
you
shall
go
free
men
have
ruined
themselves
for
a
kiss
i
coward
she
ejaculated
coward
he
repeated
coward
am
i
then
i
ll
be
a
coward
and
you
shall
kiss
me
whether
you
will
or
he
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
as
she
shrank
back
from
his
lustrous
eyes
with
an
involuntary
scream
a
figure
sprang
out
of
the
dinghy
a
few
feet
away
with
a
single
blow
neatly
directed
to
mr
jackson
s
ear
mr
jackson
was
stretched
senseless
on
the
deck
prince
aribert
of
posen
stood
over
him
with
a
revolver
it
was
probably
the
greatest
surprise
of
mr
jackson
s
whole
life
don
t
be
alarmed
said
the
prince
to
nella
my
being
here
is
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
and
i
will
explain
it
as
soon
as
i
have
finished
with
this
nella
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
but
she
noticed
the
revolver
in
the
prince
s
hand
why
she
remarked
that
s
my
it
is
he
said
and
i
will
explain
that
the
man
at
the
wheel
gave
no
heed
whatever
to
the
scene
chapter
eleven
the
court
pawnbroker
mr
sampson
levi
wishes
to
see
you
these
words
spoken
by
a
servant
to
theodore
racksole
aroused
the
millionaire
from
a
reverie
which
had
been
the
reverse
of
pleasant
the
fact
was
and
it
is
necessary
to
insist
on
it
that
mr
racksole
owner
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
was
by
no
means
in
a
state
of
satisfaction
a
mystery
had
attached
itself
to
his
hotel
and
with
all
his
acumen
and
knowledge
of
things
in
general
he
was
unable
to
solve
that
mystery
he
laughed
at
the
fruitless
efforts
of
the
police
but
he
could
not
honestly
say
that
his
own
efforts
had
been
less
barren
the
public
was
talking
for
after
all
the
disappearance
of
poor
dimmock
s
body
had
got
noised
abroad
in
an
indirect
sort
of
way
and
theodore
racksole
did
not
like
the
idea
of
his
impeccable
hotel
being
the
subject
of
sinister
rumours
he
wondered
grimly
what
the
public
and
the
sunday
newspapers
would
say
if
they
were
aware
of
all
the
other
phenomena
not
yet
common
property
of
miss
spencer
s
disappearance
of
jules
strange
visits
and
of
the
of
prince
eugen
of
posen
theodore
racksole
had
worried
his
brain
without
result
he
had
conducted
an
elaborate
private
investigation
without
result
and
he
had
spent
a
certain
amount
of
money
without
result
the
police
said
that
they
had
a
clue
but
racksole
remarked
that
it
was
always
the
business
of
the
police
to
have
a
clue
that
they
seldom
had
more
than
a
clue
and
that
a
clue
without
some
sequel
to
it
was
a
pretty
stupid
business
the
only
sure
thing
in
the
whole
affair
was
that
a
cloud
rested
over
his
hotel
his
beautiful
new
toy
the
finest
of
its
kind
the
cloud
was
not
interfering
with
business
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
cloud
and
he
fiercely
resented
its
presence
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
he
fiercely
resented
his
inability
to
dissipate
it
mr
sampson
levi
wishes
to
see
you
sir
the
servant
repeated
having
received
no
sign
that
his
master
had
heard
him
so
i
hear
said
racksole
does
he
want
to
see
me
personally
he
asked
for
you
perhaps
it
is
rocco
he
wants
to
see
about
a
menu
or
something
of
that
kind
i
will
inquire
sir
and
the
servant
made
a
move
to
withdraw
stop
racksole
commanded
suddenly
desire
mr
sampson
levi
to
step
this
the
great
stockbroker
of
the
kaffir
circus
entered
with
a
simple
unassuming
air
he
was
a
rather
short
florid
man
dressed
like
a
typical
hebraic
financier
with
too
much
and
too
little
waistcoat
in
his
fat
hand
he
held
a
cane
and
an
absolutely
new
silk
hat
for
it
was
friday
and
mr
levi
purchased
a
new
hat
every
friday
of
his
life
holiday
times
only
excepted
he
breathed
heavily
and
sniffed
through
his
nose
a
good
deal
as
though
he
had
just
performed
some
herculean
physical
labour
he
glanced
at
the
american
millionaire
with
an
expression
in
which
a
slight
embarrassment
might
have
been
detected
but
at
the
same
time
his
round
red
face
disclosed
a
certain
frank
admiration
and
good
nature
mr
racksole
i
believe
mr
theodore
racksole
proud
to
meet
you
such
were
the
first
words
of
mr
sampson
levi
in
form
they
were
the
greeting
of
a
but
strangely
enough
theodore
racksole
liked
their
tone
he
said
to
himself
that
here
precisely
where
no
one
would
have
expected
to
find
one
was
an
honest
man
good
day
said
racksole
briefly
to
what
do
i
owe
the
pleasure
i
expect
your
time
is
limited
answered
sampson
levi
anyhow
mine
is
and
so
i
ll
come
straight
to
the
point
mr
racksole
i
m
a
plain
man
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
a
gentleman
or
any
nonsense
of
that
kind
i
m
a
stockbroker
that
s
what
i
am
and
i
don
t
care
who
knows
it
the
other
night
i
had
a
ball
in
this
hotel
it
cost
me
a
couple
of
thousand
and
odd
pounds
and
by
the
way
i
wrote
out
a
cheque
for
your
bill
this
morning
i
don
t
like
balls
but
they
re
useful
to
me
and
my
little
wife
likes
em
and
so
we
give
em
now
i
ve
nothing
to
say
against
the
hotel
management
as
regards
that
ball
it
was
very
decently
done
very
decently
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
why
did
you
have
a
private
detective
among
my
guests
a
private
detective
exclaimed
racksole
somewhat
surprised
at
this
charge
yes
mr
sampson
levi
said
firmly
fanning
himself
in
his
chair
and
gazing
at
theodore
racksole
with
the
direct
earnest
expression
of
a
man
having
a
grievance
yes
a
private
detective
it
s
a
small
matter
i
know
and
i
dare
say
you
think
you
ve
got
a
right
as
proprietor
of
the
show
to
do
what
you
like
in
that
line
but
i
ve
just
called
to
tell
you
that
i
object
i
ve
called
as
a
matter
of
principle
i
m
not
angry
it
s
the
principle
of
the
my
dear
mr
levi
said
racksole
i
assure
you
that
having
let
the
gold
room
to
a
private
individual
for
a
private
entertainment
i
should
never
dream
of
doing
what
you
straight
asked
mr
sampson
levi
using
his
own
picturesque
language
straight
said
racksole
smiling
there
was
a
gent
present
at
my
ball
that
i
didn
t
ask
i
ve
got
a
wonderful
memory
for
faces
and
i
know
several
fellows
asked
me
afterwards
what
he
was
doing
there
i
was
told
by
someone
that
he
was
one
of
your
waiters
but
i
didn
t
believe
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
grand
babylon
it
s
not
quite
my
style
of
tavern
but
i
don
t
think
you
d
send
one
of
your
own
waiters
to
watch
my
guests
unless
of
course
you
sent
him
as
a
waiter
and
this
chap
didn
t
do
any
waiting
though
he
did
his
share
of
perhaps
i
can
throw
some
light
on
this
mystery
said
racksole
i
may
tell
you
that
i
was
already
aware
that
man
had
attended
your
ball
how
did
you
get
to
know
by
pure
chance
mr
levi
and
not
by
inquiry
that
man
was
a
former
waiter
at
this
hotel
the
head
waiter
in
fact
jules
no
doubt
you
have
heard
of
not
i
said
mr
levi
positively
ah
said
racksole
i
was
informed
that
everyone
knew
jules
but
it
appears
not
well
be
that
as
it
may
previously
to
the
night
of
your
ball
i
had
dismissed
jules
i
had
ordered
him
never
to
enter
the
babylon
again
but
on
that
evening
i
encountered
him
here
not
in
the
gold
room
but
in
the
hotel
itself
i
asked
him
to
explain
his
presence
and
he
stated
he
was
your
guest
that
is
all
i
know
of
the
matter
mr
levi
and
i
am
extremely
sorry
that
you
should
have
thought
me
capable
of
the
enormity
of
placing
a
private
detective
among
your
this
is
perfectly
satisfactory
to
me
mr
sampson
levi
said
after
a
pause
i
only
wanted
an
explanation
and
i
ve
got
it
i
was
told
by
some
pals
of
mine
in
the
city
i
might
rely
on
mr
theodore
racksole
going
straight
to
the
point
and
i
m
glad
they
were
right
now
as
to
that
feller
jules
i
shall
make
my
own
inquiries
as
to
him
might
i
ask
you
why
you
dismissed
him
i
don
t
know
why
i
dismissed
you
don
t
know
oh
come
now
i
m
only
asking
because
i
thought
you
might
be
able
to
give
me
a
hint
why
he
turned
up
uninvited
at
my
ball
sorry
if
i
m
too
not
at
all
mr
levi
but
i
really
don
t
know
i
only
sort
of
felt
that
he
was
a
suspicious
character
i
dismissed
him
on
instinct
as
it
were
see
without
answering
this
question
mr
levi
asked
another
if
this
jules
is
such
a
person
he
said
how
could
the
feller
hope
to
come
to
my
ball
without
being
recognized
give
it
up
said
racksole
promptly
well
i
ll
be
moving
on
was
mr
sampson
levi
s
next
remark
good
day
and
thank
ye
i
suppose
you
aren
t
doing
anything
in
kaffirs
mr
racksole
smiled
a
negative
i
thought
not
said
levi
well
i
never
touch
american
rails
myself
and
so
i
reckon
we
sha
n
t
come
across
each
other
good
good
day
said
racksole
politely
following
mr
sampson
levi
to
the
door
with
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
mr
levi
stopped
and
gazing
at
theodore
racksole
with
a
shrewd
quizzical
expression
remarked
strange
things
been
going
on
here
lately
eh
the
two
men
looked
very
hard
at
each
other
for
several
seconds
yes
racksole
assented
know
anything
about
them
well
no
not
exactly
said
mr
levi
but
i
had
a
fancy
you
and
i
might
be
useful
to
each
other
i
had
a
kind
of
fancy
to
that
come
back
and
sit
down
again
mr
levi
racksole
said
attracted
by
the
evident
straightforwardness
of
the
man
s
tone
now
how
can
we
be
of
service
to
each
other
i
flatter
myself
i
m
something
of
a
judge
of
character
especially
financial
character
and
i
tell
you
if
you
ll
put
your
cards
on
the
table
i
ll
do
ditto
with
agreed
said
mr
sampson
levi
i
ll
begin
by
explaining
my
interest
in
your
hotel
i
have
been
expecting
to
receive
a
summons
from
a
certain
prince
eugen
of
posen
to
attend
him
here
and
that
summons
hasn
t
arrived
it
appears
that
prince
eugen
hasn
t
come
to
london
at
all
now
i
could
have
taken
my
dying
davy
that
he
would
have
been
here
yesterday
at
the
why
were
you
so
sure
question
for
question
said
levi
let
s
clear
the
ground
first
mr
racksole
why
did
you
buy
this
hotel
that
s
a
conundrum
that
s
been
puzzling
a
lot
of
our
fellows
in
the
city
for
some
days
past
why
did
you
buy
the
grand
babylon
and
what
is
the
next
move
to
be
there
is
no
next
move
answered
racksole
candidly
and
i
will
tell
you
why
i
bought
the
hotel
there
need
be
no
secret
about
it
i
bought
it
because
of
a
and
then
theodore
racksole
gave
this
little
jew
whom
he
had
begun
to
respect
a
faithful
account
of
the
transaction
with
mr
felix
babylon
i
suppose
he
added
you
find
a
difficulty
in
appreciating
my
state
of
mind
when
i
did
the
not
a
bit
said
mr
levi
i
once
bought
an
electric
launch
on
the
thames
in
a
very
similar
way
and
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
purchases
i
ever
made
then
it
s
a
simple
accident
that
you
own
this
hotel
at
the
present
moment
a
simple
accident
all
because
of
a
beefsteak
and
a
bottle
of
um
grunted
mr
sampson
levi
stroking
his
triple
chin
to
return
to
prince
eugen
racksole
resumed
i
was
expecting
his
highness
here
the
state
apartments
had
been
prepared
for
him
he
was
due
on
the
very
afternoon
that
young
dimmock
died
but
he
never
came
and
i
have
not
heard
why
he
has
failed
to
arrive
nor
have
i
seen
his
name
in
the
papers
what
his
business
was
in
london
i
don
t
i
will
tell
you
said
mr
sampson
levi
he
was
coming
to
arrange
a
a
state
loan
no
a
private
whom
from
from
me
sampson
levi
you
look
surprised
if
you
d
lived
in
london
a
little
longer
you
d
know
that
i
was
just
the
person
the
prince
would
come
to
perhaps
you
aren
t
aware
that
down
throgmorton
street
way
i
m
called
the
court
pawnbroker
because
i
arrange
loans
for
the
minor
princes
of
europe
i
m
a
stockbroker
but
my
real
business
is
financing
some
of
the
little
courts
of
europe
now
i
may
tell
you
that
the
hereditary
prince
of
posen
particularly
wanted
a
million
and
he
wanted
it
by
a
certain
date
and
he
knew
that
if
the
affair
wasn
t
fixed
up
by
a
certain
time
here
he
wouldn
t
be
able
to
get
it
by
that
certain
date
that
s
why
i
m
surprised
he
isn
t
in
what
did
he
need
a
million
for
debts
answered
sampson
levi
laconically
his
own
but
he
isn
t
thirty
years
of
age
what
of
that
he
isn
t
the
only
european
prince
who
has
run
up
a
million
of
debts
in
a
dozen
years
to
a
prince
the
thing
is
as
easy
as
eating
a
and
why
has
he
taken
this
sudden
resolution
to
liquidate
them
because
the
emperor
and
the
lady
s
parents
won
t
let
him
marry
till
he
has
done
so
and
quite
right
too
he
s
got
to
show
a
clean
sheet
or
the
princess
anna
of
will
never
be
princess
of
posen
even
now
the
emperor
has
no
idea
how
much
prince
eugen
s
debts
amount
to
if
he
had
but
would
not
the
emperor
know
of
this
proposed
loan
not
necessarily
at
once
it
could
be
so
managed
twig
mr
sampson
levi
laughed
i
ve
carried
these
little
affairs
through
before
after
marriage
it
might
be
allowed
to
leak
out
and
you
know
the
princess
anna
s
fortune
is
pretty
big
now
mr
racksole
he
added
abruptly
changing
his
tone
where
do
you
suppose
prince
eugen
has
disappeared
to
because
if
he
doesn
t
turn
up
he
can
t
have
that
million
day
is
the
last
day
the
money
will
be
appropriated
elsewhere
of
course
i
m
not
alone
in
this
business
and
my
friends
have
something
to
you
ask
me
where
i
think
prince
eugen
has
disappeared
to
i
then
you
think
it
s
a
disappearance
sampson
levi
nodded
putting
two
and
two
together
he
said
i
do
the
dimmock
business
is
very
peculiar
very
peculiar
indeed
dimmock
was
a
relation
of
the
posen
family
twig
scarcely
anyone
knows
that
he
was
made
secretary
and
companion
to
prince
aribert
just
to
keep
him
in
the
domestic
circle
his
mother
was
an
irishwoman
whose
misfortune
was
that
she
was
too
beautiful
twig
mr
sampson
levi
always
used
this
extraordinary
word
when
he
was
in
a
communicative
mood
my
belief
is
that
dimmock
s
death
has
something
to
do
with
the
disappearance
of
prince
eugen
the
only
thing
that
passes
me
is
this
why
should
anyone
want
to
make
prince
eugen
disappear
the
poor
little
prince
hasn
t
an
enemy
in
the
world
if
he
s
been
copped
as
they
say
why
has
he
been
copped
it
won
t
do
anyone
any
won
t
it
repeated
racksole
with
a
sudden
flash
what
do
you
mean
asked
mr
levi
i
mean
this
suppose
some
other
european
pauper
prince
was
anxious
to
marry
princess
anna
and
her
fortune
wouldn
t
that
prince
have
an
interest
in
stopping
this
loan
of
yours
to
prince
eugen
wouldn
t
he
have
an
interest
in
causing
prince
eugen
to
disappear
at
any
rate
for
a
time
sampson
levi
thought
hard
for
a
few
moments
mr
theodore
racksole
he
said
at
length
i
do
believe
you
have
hit
on
chapter
twelve
rocco
and
room
no
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
the
interview
just
described
had
occurred
in
the
morning
racksole
was
visited
by
another
idea
and
he
said
to
himself
that
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
before
the
conversation
with
mr
sampson
levi
had
continued
for
a
considerable
time
and
the
two
men
had
exchanged
various
notions
and
agreed
to
meet
again
but
the
theory
that
reginald
dimmock
had
probably
been
a
traitor
to
his
family
a
traitor
whose
repentance
had
caused
his
death
had
not
been
thoroughly
discussed
the
talk
had
tended
rather
to
continental
politics
with
a
view
to
discovering
what
princely
family
might
have
an
interest
in
the
temporary
disappearance
of
prince
eugen
now
as
racksole
considered
in
detail
the
particular
affair
of
reginald
dimmock
deceased
he
was
struck
by
one
point
especially
to
wit
why
had
dimmock
and
jules
manoeuvred
to
turn
nella
racksole
out
of
room
no
on
that
first
night
that
they
had
so
manoeuvred
that
the
broken
was
not
a
mere
accident
racksole
felt
perfectly
sure
he
had
felt
perfectly
sure
all
along
but
the
significance
of
the
facts
had
not
struck
him
it
was
plain
to
him
now
that
there
must
be
something
of
extraordinary
and
peculiar
importance
about
room
no
after
lunch
he
wandered
quietly
upstairs
and
looked
at
room
no
that
is
to
say
he
looked
at
the
outside
of
it
it
happened
to
be
occupied
but
the
guest
was
leaving
that
evening
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
there
could
be
no
object
in
gazing
blankly
at
the
outside
of
a
room
yet
he
gazed
then
he
wandered
quickly
down
again
to
the
next
floor
and
in
passing
along
the
corridor
of
that
floor
he
stopped
and
with
an
involuntary
gesture
stamped
his
foot
great
scott
he
said
i
ve
got
hold
of
something
no
is
exactly
over
the
state
he
went
to
the
bureau
and
issued
instructions
that
no
was
not
to
be
to
anyone
until
further
orders
at
the
bureau
they
gave
him
nella
s
note
which
ran
thus
dearest
papa
i
am
going
away
for
a
day
or
two
on
the
trail
of
a
clue
if
i
m
not
back
in
three
days
begin
to
inquire
for
me
at
ostend
till
then
leave
me
your
sagacious
daughter
nell
these
few
words
in
nella
s
large
scrawling
hand
filled
one
side
of
the
paper
at
the
bottom
was
a
he
turned
over
and
read
the
sentence
underlined
keep
an
eye
on
i
wonder
what
the
little
creature
is
up
to
he
murmured
as
he
tore
the
letter
into
small
fragments
and
threw
them
into
the
basket
then
without
any
delay
he
took
the
lift
down
to
the
basement
with
the
object
of
making
a
preliminary
inspection
of
rocco
in
his
lair
he
could
scarcely
bring
himself
to
believe
that
this
suave
and
stately
gentleman
this
enthusiast
of
gastronomy
was
concerned
in
the
machinations
of
jules
and
other
rascals
unknown
nevertheless
from
habit
he
obeyed
his
daughter
giving
her
credit
for
a
certain
amount
of
perspicuity
and
cleverness
the
kitchens
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
are
one
of
the
wonders
of
europe
only
three
years
before
the
events
now
under
narration
felix
babylon
had
had
them
newly
installed
with
every
device
and
patent
that
the
ingenuity
of
two
continents
could
supply
they
covered
nearly
an
acre
of
superficial
space
they
were
walled
and
floored
from
end
to
end
with
tiles
and
marble
which
enabled
them
to
be
washed
down
every
morning
like
the
deck
of
a
visitors
were
sometimes
taken
to
see
the
machine
the
patent
the
a
contrivance
of
felix
babylon
s
own
the
the
system
of
connected
and
other
amazing
phenomena
of
the
department
sometimes
if
they
were
fortunate
they
might
also
see
the
artist
who
sculptured
ice
into
forms
of
men
and
beasts
for
table
ornaments
or
the
first
in
london
or
the
man
who
daily
invented
fresh
designs
for
pastry
and
blancmanges
twelve
chefs
pursued
their
labours
in
those
kitchens
helped
by
ninety
assistant
chefs
and
a
further
army
of
unconsidered
menials
over
all
these
was
rocco
supreme
and
unapproachable
along
the
suite
of
kitchens
rocco
had
an
apartment
of
his
own
wherein
he
thought
out
those
magnificent
combinations
those
marvellous
feats
of
succulence
and
originality
which
had
given
him
his
fame
visitors
never
caught
a
glimpse
of
rocco
in
the
kitchens
though
sometimes
on
a
special
night
he
would
stroll
nonchalantly
through
the
like
the
great
man
he
was
to
receive
the
compliments
of
the
hotel
habitués
people
of
insight
who
recognized
his
uniqueness
theodore
racksole
s
sudden
and
unusual
appearance
in
the
kitchen
caused
a
little
stir
he
nodded
to
some
of
the
chefs
but
said
nothing
to
anyone
merely
wandering
about
amid
the
maze
of
copper
utensils
and
workers
at
length
he
saw
rocco
surrounded
by
several
admiring
chefs
rocco
was
bending
over
a
partridge
which
lay
on
a
blue
dish
he
plunged
a
long
fork
into
the
back
of
the
bird
and
raised
it
in
the
air
with
his
left
hand
in
his
right
he
held
a
long
glittering
he
was
giving
one
of
his
exhibitions
of
carving
in
four
swift
unerring
delicate
perfect
strokes
he
cleanly
severed
the
limbs
of
the
partridge
it
was
a
wonderful
achievement
how
wondrous
none
but
the
really
skilful
carver
can
properly
appreciate
the
chefs
emitted
a
hum
of
applause
and
rocco
long
lean
and
graceful
retired
to
his
own
apartment
racksole
followed
him
rocco
sat
in
a
chair
one
hand
over
his
eyes
he
had
not
noticed
theodore
racksole
what
are
you
doing
rocco
the
millionaire
asked
smiling
ah
exclaimed
rocco
starting
up
with
an
apology
pardon
i
was
inventing
a
new
mayonnaise
which
i
shall
need
for
a
certain
menu
next
do
you
invent
these
things
without
materials
then
questioned
racksole
certainly
i
do
dem
in
my
mind
i
tink
dem
why
should
i
want
materials
i
know
all
flavours
i
tink
and

and
tink
and
it
is
done
i
write
down

give
the
recipe
to
my
best
chef
dere

are
i
need
not

great
composers

racksole
it

rocco
added
gravely
heard
about
jules
said
racksole
abruptly
jules
yes

s
been
arrested
in
ostend
the
millionaire
continued
lying
cleverly
at
a
venture
they
say
that
he
and
several
others
are
implicated
in
a
murder
case
the
murder
of
reginald
truly
drawled
rocco
scarcely
hiding
a
yawn
his
indifference
was
so
superb
so
gorgeous
that
racksole
instantly
divined
that
it
was
assumed
for
the
occasion
it
seems
that
after
all
the
police
are
good
for
something
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
them
to
be
worth
their
salt
there
is
to
be
a
thorough
and
systematic
search
of
the
hotel
racksole
went
on
i
have
mentioned
it
to
you
to
warn
you
that
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
the
search
is
of
course
merely
a
matter
of
form
you
will
not
object
to
the
detectives
looking
through
your
rooms
certainly
not
and
rocco
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
shall
ask
you
to
say
nothing
about
this
to
anyone
said
racksole
the
news
of
jules
arrest
is
quite
private
to
myself
the
papers
know
nothing
of
it
you
comprehend
rocco
smiled
in
his
grand
manner
and
rocco
s
master
thereupon
went
away
racksole
was
very
well
satisfied
with
the
little
conversation
it
was
perhaps
dangerous
to
tell
a
series
of
mere
lies
to
a
clever
fellow
like
rocco
and
racksole
wondered
how
he
should
ultimately
explain
them
to
this
great
if
his
and
nella
s
suspicions
should
be
unfounded
and
nothing
came
of
them
nevertheless
rocco
s
manner
a
strange
elusive
something
in
the
man
s
eyes
had
nearly
convinced
racksole
that
he
was
somehow
implicated
in
jules
schemes
and
probably
in
the
death
of
reginald
dimmock
and
the
disappearance
of
prince
eugen
of
posen
that
night
or
rather
about
one
the
next
morning
when
the
last
noises
of
the
hotel
s
life
had
died
down
racksole
made
his
way
to
room
on
the
second
floor
he
locked
the
door
on
the
inside
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
place
square
foot
by
square
foot
every
now
and
then
some
creak
or
other
sound
startled
him
and
he
listened
intently
for
a
few
seconds
the
bedroom
was
furnished
in
the
ordinary
splendid
style
of
bedrooms
at
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
and
in
that
respect
called
for
no
remark
what
most
interested
racksole
was
the
flooring
he
pulled
up
the
thick
oriental
carpet
and
peered
along
every
plank
but
could
discover
nothing
unusual
then
he
went
to
the
and
finally
to
the
bathroom
both
of
which
opened
out
of
the
main
room
but
in
neither
of
these
smaller
chambers
was
he
any
more
successful
than
in
the
bedroom
itself
finally
he
came
to
the
bath
which
was
enclosed
in
a
panelled
casing
of
polished
wood
after
the
manner
of
baths
some
baths
have
a
cupboard
beneath
the
taps
with
a
door
at
the
side
but
this
one
appeared
to
have
none
he
tapped
the
panels
but
not
a
single
one
of
them
gave
forth
that
curious
hollow
sound
which
usually
betokens
a
secret
place
idly
he
turned
the
of
the
bath
and
the
water
began
to
rush
in
he
turned
off
the
and
turned
on
the
and
as
he
did
so
his
knee
which
was
pressing
against
the
panelling
slipped
forward
the
panelling
had
given
way
and
he
saw
that
one
large
panel
was
hinged
from
the
inside
and
caught
with
a
hasp
also
on
the
inside
a
large
space
within
the
casing
of
the
end
of
the
bath
was
thus
revealed
before
doing
anything
else
racksole
tried
to
repeat
the
trick
with
the
but
he
failed
it
would
not
work
again
nor
could
he
in
any
way
perceive
that
there
was
any
connection
between
the
rod
of
the
and
the
hasp
of
the
panel
racksole
could
not
see
into
the
cavity
within
the
casing
and
the
electric
light
was
fixed
and
could
not
be
moved
about
like
a
candle
he
felt
in
his
pockets
and
fortunately
discovered
a
box
of
matches
aided
by
these
he
looked
into
the
cavity
and
saw
nothing
nothing
except
a
rather
large
hole
at
the
far
end
some
three
feet
from
the
casing
with
some
difficulty
he
squeezed
himself
through
the
open
panel
and
took
a
posture
within
there
he
struck
a
match
and
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
thing
that
in
striking
the
box
being
half
open
he
set
fire
to
all
the
matches
and
was
half
smothered
in
the
atrocious
stink
of
phosphorus
which
resulted
one
match
burned
clear
on
the
floor
of
the
cavity
and
rubbing
his
eyes
racksole
picked
it
up
and
looked
down
the
hole
which
he
had
previously
descried
it
was
a
hole
apparently
bottomless
and
about
eighteen
inches
square
the
curious
part
about
the
hole
was
that
a
hung
down
it
when
he
saw
that
racksole
smiled
the
smile
of
a
happy
man
the
match
went
out
should
he
make
a
long
journey
perhaps
to
some
distant
corner
of
the
hotel
for
a
fresh
box
of
matches
or
should
he
attempt
to
descend
that
in
the
dark
he
decided
on
the
latter
course
and
he
was
the
more
strongly
moved
thereto
as
he
could
now
distinguish
a
faint
a
very
faint
tinge
of
light
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
with
infinite
care
he
compressed
himself
into
the
hole
and
descended
the
latter
at
length
he
arrived
on
firm
ground
perspiring
but
quite
safe
and
quite
excited
he
saw
now
that
the
tinge
of
light
came
through
a
small
hole
in
the
wood
he
put
his
eye
to
the
wood
and
found
that
he
had
a
fine
view
of
the
state
bathroom
and
through
the
door
of
the
state
bathroom
into
the
state
bedroom
at
the
massive
washstand
in
the
state
bedroom
a
man
was
visible
bending
over
some
object
which
lay
thereon
the
man
was
rocco
chapter
thirteen
in
the
state
bedroom
it
was
of
course
plain
to
racksole
that
the
peculiar
passageway
which
he
had
at
great
personal
inconvenience
discovered
between
the
bathroom
of
no
and
the
state
bathroom
on
the
floor
below
must
have
been
specially
designed
by
some
person
or
persons
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
a
nefarious
watch
upon
the
occupants
of
the
state
suite
of
apartments
it
was
a
means
of
communication
at
once
simple
and
ingenious
at
that
moment
he
could
not
be
sure
of
the
precise
method
employed
for
it
but
he
surmised
that
the
casing
of
the
waterpipes
had
been
used
as
a
well
while
space
for
the
pipes
themselves
had
been
found
in
the
thickness
of
the
ample
brick
walls
of
the
grand
babylon
the
through
which
he
now
had
a
view
of
the
bedroom
was
a
very
minute
one
and
probably
would
scarcely
be
noticed
from
the
exterior
one
thing
he
observed
concerning
it
namely
that
it
had
been
made
for
a
man
somewhat
taller
than
himself
he
was
obliged
to
stand
on
tiptoe
in
order
to
get
his
eye
in
the
correct
position
he
remembered
that
both
jules
and
rocco
were
distinctly
above
the
average
height
also
that
they
were
both
thin
men
and
could
have
descended
the
well
with
comparative
ease
theodore
racksole
though
not
stout
was
a
man
with
large
bones
these
things
flashed
through
his
mind
as
he
gazed
spellbound
at
the
mysterious
movements
of
rocco
the
door
between
the
bathroom
and
the
bedroom
was
wide
open
and
his
own
situation
was
such
that
his
view
embraced
a
considerable
portion
of
the
bedroom
including
the
whole
of
the
immense
and
bedstead
but
not
including
the
whole
of
the
marble
washstand
he
could
see
only
half
of
the
washstand
and
at
intervals
rocco
passed
out
of
sight
as
his
lithe
hands
moved
over
the
object
which
lay
on
the
marble
at
first
theodore
racksole
could
not
decide
what
this
object
was
but
after
a
time
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
position
and
the
light
he
made
it
out
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
or
rather
to
be
more
exact
racksole
could
discern
the
legs
of
a
man
on
that
half
of
the
table
which
was
visible
to
him
involuntarily
he
shuddered
as
the
conviction
forced
itself
upon
him
that
rocco
had
some
unconscious
human
being
helpless
on
that
cold
marble
surface
the
legs
never
moved
therefore
the
hapless
creature
was
either
asleep
or
under
the
influence
of
an
anaesthetic
or
horrible
thought
dead
racksole
wanted
to
call
out
to
stop
by
some
means
or
other
the
dreadful
midnight
activity
which
was
proceeding
before
his
astonished
eyes
but
fortunately
he
restrained
himself
on
the
washstand
he
could
see
certain
utensils
and
instruments
which
rocco
used
from
time
to
time
the
work
seemed
to
racksole
to
continue
for
interminable
hours
and
then
at
last
rocco
ceased
gave
a
sign
of
satisfaction
whistled
several
bars
from
cavalleria
rusticana
and
came
into
the
where
he
took
off
his
coat
and
very
quietly
washed
his
hands
as
he
stood
calmly
and
leisurely
wiping
those
long
fingers
of
his
he
was
less
than
four
feet
from
racksole
and
the
millionaire
trembled
holding
his
breath
lest
rocco
should
detect
his
presence
behind
the
woodwork
but
nothing
happened
and
rocco
returned
unsuspectingly
to
the
bedroom
racksole
saw
him
place
some
sort
of
white
flannel
garment
over
the
prone
form
on
the
table
and
then
lift
it
bodily
on
to
the
great
bed
where
it
lay
awfully
still
the
hidden
watcher
was
sure
now
that
it
was
a
corpse
upon
which
rocco
had
been
exercising
his
mysterious
and
sinister
functions
but
whose
corpse
and
what
functions
could
this
be
a
west
end
hotel
racksole
s
own
hotel
in
the
very
heart
of
london
the
city
in
the
world
it
seemed
incredible
impossible
yet
so
it
was
once
more
he
remembered
what
felix
babylon
had
said
to
him
and
realized
the
truth
of
the
saying
anew
the
proprietor
of
a
vast
and
complicated
establishment
like
the
grand
babylon
could
never
know
a
tithe
of
the
extraordinary
and
queer
occurrences
which
happened
daily
under
his
very
nose
the
atmosphere
of
such
a
caravanserai
must
necessarily
be
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
problems
apparently
inexplicable
nevertheless
racksole
thought
that
fate
was
carrying
things
with
rather
a
high
hand
when
she
permitted
his
chef
to
spend
the
night
hours
over
a
man
s
corpse
in
his
state
bedroom
this
sacred
apartment
which
was
supposed
to
be
occupied
only
by
individuals
of
royal
blood
racksole
would
not
have
objected
to
a
certain
amount
of
mystery
but
he
decidedly
thought
that
there
was
a
little
too
much
mystery
here
for
his
taste
he
thought
that
even
felix
babylon
would
have
been
surprised
at
this
the
electric
chandelier
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
was
not
lighted
only
the
two
lights
on
either
side
of
the
washstand
were
switched
on
and
these
did
not
sufficiently
illuminate
the
features
of
the
man
on
the
bed
to
enable
racksole
to
see
them
clearly
in
vain
the
millionaire
strained
his
eyes
he
could
only
make
out
that
the
corpse
was
probably
that
of
a
young
man
just
as
he
was
wondering
what
would
be
the
best
course
of
action
to
pursue
he
saw
rocco
with
a
black
box
in
his
hand
then
the
chef
switched
off
the
two
electric
lights
and
the
state
bedroom
was
in
darkness
in
that
swift
darkness
racksole
heard
rocco
spring
on
to
the
bed
another
moments
of
suspense
and
there
was
a
blinding
flash
of
white
which
endured
for
several
seconds
and
showed
rocco
standing
like
an
evil
spirit
over
the
corpse
the
black
box
in
one
hand
and
a
burning
piece
of
aluminium
wire
in
the
other
the
aluminium
wire
burnt
out
and
darkness
followed
blacker
than
before
rocco
had
photographed
the
corpse
by
flashlight
but
the
dazzling
flare
which
had
disclosed
the
features
of
the
dead
man
to
the
insensible
lens
of
the
camera
had
disclosed
them
also
to
theodore
racksole
the
dead
man
was
reginald
dimmock
stung
into
action
by
this
discovery
racksole
tried
to
find
the
exit
from
his
place
of
concealment
he
felt
sure
that
there
existed
some
way
out
into
the
state
bathroom
but
he
sought
for
it
fruitlessly
groping
with
both
hands
and
feet
then
he
decided
that
he
must
ascend
the
ladder
make
haste
for
the
corridor
and
intercept
rocco
when
he
left
the
state
apartments
it
was
a
painful
and
difficult
business
to
ascend
that
thin
and
yielding
ladder
in
such
a
confined
space
but
racksole
was
managing
it
very
nicely
and
had
nearly
reached
the
top
when
by
some
untoward
freak
of
chance
the
ladder
broke
above
his
weight
and
he
slipped
ignominiously
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
wooden
tube
smothering
an
excusable
curse
racksole
crouched
baffled
then
he
saw
that
the
force
of
his
fall
had
somehow
opened
a
at
his
feet
he
squeezed
through
pushed
open
another
tiny
door
and
in
another
second
stood
in
the
state
bathroom
he
was
dishevelled
perspiring
rather
bewildered
but
he
was
there
in
the
next
second
he
had
resumed
absolute
command
of
all
his
faculties
strange
to
say
he
had
moved
so
quietly
that
rocco
had
apparently
not
heard
him
he
stepped
noiselessly
to
the
door
between
the
bathroom
and
the
bedroom
and
stood
there
in
silence
rocco
had
switched
on
again
the
lights
over
the
washstand
and
was
busy
with
his
utensils
racksole
deliberately
coughed
chapter
fourteen
rocco
answers
some
questions
rocco
turned
round
with
the
swiftness
of
a
startled
tiger
and
gave
theodore
racksole
one
long
piercing
glance
d
n
said
rocco
with
as
pure
an
accent
and
intonation
as
racksole
himself
could
have
accomplished
the
most
extraordinary
thing
about
the
situation
was
that
at
this
juncture
theodore
racksole
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
was
so
dumbfounded
by
the
affair
and
especially
by
rocco
s
absolute
and
sublime
calm
that
both
speech
and
thought
failed
him
i
give
in
said
rocco
from
the
moment
you
entered
this
cursed
hotel
i
was
afraid
of
you
i
told
jules
i
was
afraid
of
you
i
knew
there
would
be
trouble
with
a
man
of
your
kidney
and
i
was
right
confound
it
i
tell
you
i
give
in
i
know
when
i
m
beaten
i
ve
got
no
revolver
and
no
weapons
of
any
kind
i
surrender
do
what
you
and
with
that
rocco
sat
down
on
a
chair
it
was
magnificently
done
only
a
truly
great
man
could
have
done
it
rocco
actually
kept
his
dignity
for
answer
racksole
walked
slowly
into
the
vast
apartment
seized
a
chair
and
dragging
it
up
to
rocco
s
chair
sat
down
opposite
to
him
thus
they
faced
each
other
their
knees
almost
touching
both
in
evening
dress
on
rocco
s
right
hand
was
the
bed
with
the
corpse
of
reginald
dimmock
on
racksole
s
right
hand
and
a
little
behind
him
was
the
marble
washstand
still
littered
with
rocco
s
implements
the
electric
light
shone
on
rocco
s
left
cheek
leaving
the
other
side
of
his
face
in
shadow
racksole
tapped
him
on
the
knee
twice
so
you
re
another
englishman
masquerading
as
a
foreigner
in
my
hotel
racksole
remarked
by
way
of
commencing
the
interrogation
i
m
not
answered
rocco
quietly
i
m
a
citizen
of
the
united
the
deuce
you
are
racksole
exclaimed
yes
i
was
born
at
west
orange
new
jersey
new
york
state
i
call
myself
an
italian
because
it
was
in
italy
that
i
first
made
a
name
as
a
chef
at
rome
it
is
better
for
a
great
chef
like
me
to
be
a
foreigner
imagine
a
great
chef
named
elihu
rucker
you
can
t
imagine
it
i
changed
my
nationality
for
the
same
reason
that
my
friend
and
colleague
jules
otherwise
mr
jackson
changed
so
jules
is
your
friend
and
colleague
is
he
he
was
but
from
this
moment
he
is
no
longer
i
began
to
disapprove
of
his
methods
no
less
than
a
week
ago
and
my
disapproval
will
now
take
active
will
it
said
racksole
i
calculate
it
just
won
t
mr

be

an
abrupt
it
is
possible
sighed
rocco
in
the
meantime
i
ll
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
for
my
own
private
satisfaction
you
ve
acknowledged
that
the
game
is
up
and
you
may
as
well
answer
them
with
as
much
candour
as
you
feel
yourself
capable
of
see
i
see
replied
rocco
calmly
but
i
guess
i
can
t
answer
all
questions
i
ll
do
what
i
well
said
racksole
clearing
his
throat
what
s
the
scheme
all
about
tell
me
in
a
not
in
a
thousand
words
it
isn
t
my
secret
you
why
was
poor
little
dimmock
poisoned
the
millionaire
s
voice
softened
as
he
looked
for
an
instant
at
the
corpse
of
the
unfortunate
young
man
i
don
t
know
said
rocco
i
don
t
mind
informing
you
that
i
objected
to
that
part
of
the
business
i
wasn
t
made
aware
of
it
till
after
it
was
done
and
then
i
tell
you
it
got
my
dander
up
you
mean
to
say
you
don
t
know
why
dimmock
was
done
to
death
i
mean
to
say
i
couldn
t
see
the
sense
of
it
of
course
he
er
died
because
he
sort
of
cried
off
the
scheme
having
previously
taken
a
share
of
it
i
don
t
mind
saying
that
much
because
you
probably
guessed
it
for
yourself
but
i
solemnly
state
that
i
have
a
conscientious
objection
to
then
it
was
murder
it
was
a
kind
of
murder
rocco
admitted
who
did
it
unfair
question
said
rocco
who
else
is
in
this
precious
scheme
besides
jules
and
yourself
don
t
know
on
my
well
then
tell
me
this
what
have
you
been
doing
to
dimmock
s
body
how
long
were
you
in
that
bathroom
rocco
parried
with
sublime
impudence
don
t
question
me
mr
rucker
said
theodore
racksole
i
feel
very
much
inclined
to
break
your
back
across
my
knee
therefore
i
advise
you
not
to
irritate
me
what
have
you
been
doing
to
dimmock
s
body
i
ve
been
embalming
em
balming
certainly
richardson
s
system
of
arterial
fluid
injection
as
improved
by
myself
you
weren
t
aware
that
i
included
the
art
of
embalming
among
my
accomplishments
nevertheless
it
is
but
why
asked
racksole
more
mystified
than
ever
why
should
you
trouble
to
embalm
the
poor
chap
s
corpse
can
t
you
see
doesn
t
it
strike
you
that
corpse
has
to
be
taken
care
of
it
contains
or
rather
it
did
contain
very
serious
evidence
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
to
the
police
it
may
be
necessary
to
move
it
about
from
place
to
place
a
corpse
can
t
be
hidden
for
long
a
corpse
betrays
itself
one
couldn
t
throw
it
in
the
thames
for
it
would
have
been
found
inside
twelve
hours
one
couldn
t
bury
it
it
wasn
t
safe
the
only
thing
was
to
keep
it
handy
and
movable
ready
for
emergencies
i
needn
t
inform
you
that
without
embalming
you
can
t
keep
a
corpse
handy
and
movable
for
more
than
four
or
five
days
it
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
won
t
keep
and
so
it
was
suggested
that
i
should
embalm
it
and
i
did
mind
you
i
still
objected
to
the
murder
but
i
couldn
t
go
back
on
a
colleague
you
understand
you
do
understand
that
don
t
you
well
here
you
are
and
here
it
is
and
that
s
rocco
leaned
back
in
his
chair
as
though
he
had
said
everything
that
ought
to
be
said
he
closed
his
eyes
to
indicate
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
conversation
was
also
closed
theodore
racksole
stood
up
i
hope
said
rocco
suddenly
opening
his
eyes
i
hope
you
ll
call
in
the
police
without
any
delay
it
s
getting
late
and
i
don
t
like
going
without
my
night
s
where
do
you
suppose
you
ll
get
a
night
s
rest
racksole
asked
in
the
cells
of
course
haven
t
i
told
you
i
know
when
i
m
beaten
i
m
not
so
blind
as
not
to
be
able
to
see
that
there
s
at
any
rate
a
prima
facie
case
against
me
i
expect
i
shall
get
off
with
a
year
or
two
s
imprisonment
as
accessory
after
the
fact
i
think
that
s
what
they
call
it
anyhow
i
shall
be
in
a
position
to
prove
that
i
am
not
implicated
in
the
murder
of
this
unfortunate
he
pointed
with
a
strange
scornful
gesture
of
his
elbow
to
the
bed
and
now
shall
we
go
everyone
is
asleep
but
there
will
be
a
policeman
within
call
of
the
watchman
in
the
portico
i
am
at
your
service
let
us
go
down
together
mr
racksole
i
give
you
my
word
to
go
stay
a
moment
said
theodore
racksole
curtly
there
is
no
hurry
it
won
t
do
you
any
harm
to
forego
another
hour
s
sleep
especially
as
you
will
have
no
work
to
do
i
have
one
or
two
more
questions
to
put
to
well
rocco
murmured
with
an
air
of
tired
resignation
as
if
to
say
what
must
be
must
where
has
dimmock
s
corpse
been
during
the
last
three
or
four
days
since
he
died
oh
answered
rocco
apparently
surprised
at
the
simplicity
of
the
question
it
s
been
in
my
room
and
one
night
it
was
on
the
roof
once
it
went
out
of
the
hotel
as
luggage
but
it
came
back
the
next
day
as
a
case
of
demerara
sugar
i
forget
where
else
it
has
been
but
it
s
been
kept
perfectly
safe
and
treated
with
every
and
who
contrived
all
these
manoeuvres
asked
racksole
as
calmly
as
he
could
i
did
that
is
to
say
i
invented
them
and
i
saw
that
they
were
carried
out
you
see
the
suspicions
of
your
police
obliged
me
to
be
particularly
and
who
carried
them
out
ah
that
would
be
telling
tales
but
i
don
t
mind
assuring
you
that
my
accomplices
were
innocent
accomplices
it
is
absurdly
easy
for
a
man
like
me
to
impose
on
underlings
absurdly
what
did
you
intend
to
do
with
the
corpse
ultimately
racksole
pursued
his
inquiry
with
immovable
countenance
who
knows
said
rocco
twisting
his
beautiful
moustache
that
would
have
depended
on
several
things
on
your
police
for
instance
but
probably
in
the
end
we
should
have
restored
this
mortal
clay
again
he
jerked
his
elbow
to
the
man
s
sorrowing
do
you
know
who
the
relatives
are
certainly
don
t
you
if
you
don
t
i
need
only
hint
that
dimmock
had
a
prince
for
his
it
seems
to
me
said
racksole
with
cold
sarcasm
that
you
behaved
rather
clumsily
in
choosing
this
bedroom
as
the
scene
of
your
not
at
all
said
rocco
there
was
no
other
apartment
so
suitable
in
the
whole
hotel
who
would
have
guessed
that
anything
was
going
on
here
it
was
the
very
place
for
i
guessed
said
racksole
succinctly
yes
you
guessed
mr
racksole
but
i
had
not
counted
on
you
you
are
the
only
smart
man
in
the
business
you
are
an
american
citizen
and
i
hadn
t
reckoned
to
have
to
deal
with
that
class
of
apparently
i
frightened
you
this
afternoon
not
in
the
you
were
not
afraid
of
a
search
i
knew
that
no
search
was
intended
i
knew
that
you
were
trying
to
frighten
me
you
must
really
credit
me
with
a
little
sagacity
and
insight
mr
racksole
immediately
you
began
to
talk
to
me
in
the
kitchen
this
afternoon
i
felt
you
were
on
the
track
but
i
was
not
frightened
i
merely
decided
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
that
i
must
act
quickly
i
did
act
quickly
but
it
seems
not
quickly
enough
i
grant
that
your
rapidity
exceeded
mine
let
us
go
downstairs
i
rocco
rose
and
moved
towards
the
door
with
an
instinctive
action
racksole
rushed
forward
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
no
tricks
said
racksole
you
re
in
my
custody
and
don
t
forget
rocco
turned
on
his
employer
a
look
of
gentle
dignified
scorn
have
i
not
informed
you
he
said
that
i
have
the
intention
of
going
quietly
racksole
felt
almost
ashamed
for
the
moment
it
flashed
across
him
that
a
man
can
be
great
even
in
crime
what
an
ineffable
fool
you
were
said
racksole
stopping
him
at
the
threshold
with
your
talents
your
unique
talents
to
get
yourself
mixed
up
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
you
are
ruined
and
by
jove
you
were
a
great
man
in
your
own
mr
racksole
said
rocco
very
quickly
that
is
the
truest
word
you
have
spoken
this
night
i
was
a
great
man
in
my
own
line
and
i
am
an
ineffable
fool
alas
he
brought
his
long
arms
to
his
sides
with
a
thud
why
did
you
do
it
i
was
fascinated
fascinated
by
jules
he
too
is
a
great
man
we
had
great
opportunities
here
in
the
grand
babylon
it
was
a
great
game
it
was
worth
the
candle
the
prizes
were
enormous
you
would
admit
these
things
if
you
knew
the
facts
perhaps
some
day
you
will
know
them
for
you
are
a
fairly
clever
person
at
getting
to
the
root
of
a
matter
yes
i
was
blinded
and
now
you
are
not
ruined
not
ruined
afterwards
in
a
few
years
i
shall
come
up
again
a
man
of
genius
like
me
is
never
ruined
till
he
is
dead
genius
is
always
forgiven
i
shall
be
forgiven
suppose
i
am
sent
to
prison
when
i
emerge
i
shall
be
no
i
shall
be
rocco
the
great
rocco
and
half
the
hotels
in
europe
will
invite
me
to
join
let
me
tell
you
as
man
to
man
that
you
have
achieved
your
own
degradation
there
is
no
i
know
it
said
rocco
let
us
racksole
was
distinctly
and
notably
impressed
by
this
man
by
this
master
spirit
to
whom
he
was
to
have
paid
a
salary
at
the
rate
of
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
he
even
felt
sorry
for
him
and
so
side
by
side
the
captor
and
the
captured
they
passed
into
the
vast
deserted
corridor
of
the
hotel
rocco
stopped
at
the
grating
of
the
first
lift
it
will
be
locked
said
racksole
we
must
use
the
stairs
but
i
have
a
key
i
always
carry
one
said
rocco
and
he
pulled
one
out
of
his
pocket
and
unfastening
the
iron
screen
pushed
it
open
racksole
smiled
at
his
readiness
and
aplomb
after
you
said
rocco
bowing
in
his
finest
manner
and
racksole
stepped
into
the
lift
with
the
swiftness
of
lighting
rocco
pushed
forward
the
iron
screen
which
locked
itself
automatically
theodore
racksole
was
hopelessly
a
prisoner
within
the
lift
while
rocco
stood
free
in
the
corridor
mr
racksole
he
remarked
suavely
bowing
again
lower
than
before
i
hate
to
take
a
mean
advantage
of
you
in
this
fashion
but
really
you
must
allow
that
you
have
been
very
simple
you
are
a
clever
man
as
i
have
already
said
up
to
a
certain
point
it
is
past
that
point
that
my
own
cleverness
comes
in
again
after
all
i
shall
have
no
rest
but
perhaps
even
that
will
be
better
that
sleeping
in
a
police
cell
if
you
make
a
great
noise
you
may
wake
someone
and
ultimately
get
released
from
this
lift
but
i
advise
you
to
compose
yourself
and
wait
till
morning
it
will
be
more
dignified
for
the
third
time
and
with
that
rocco
without
hastening
walked
down
the
corridor
and
so
out
of
sight
racksole
said
never
a
word
he
was
too
disgusted
with
himself
to
speak
he
clenched
his
fists
and
put
his
teeth
together
and
held
his
breath
in
the
silence
he
could
hear
the
dwindling
sound
of
rocco
s
footsteps
on
the
thick
carpet
it
was
the
greatest
blow
of
racksole
s
life
the
next
morning
the
guests
of
the
grand
babylon
were
aroused
by
a
rumour
that
by
some
accident
the
millionaire
proprietor
of
the
hotel
had
remained
all
night
locked
up
in
the
lift
it
was
also
stated
that
rocco
had
quarrelled
with
his
new
master
and
incontinently
left
the
place
a
duchess
said
that
rocco
s
departure
would
mean
the
ruin
of
the
hotel
whereupon
her
husband
advised
her
not
to
talk
nonsense
as
for
racksole
he
sent
a
message
for
the
detective
in
charge
of
the
dimmock
affair
and
bravely
told
him
the
happenings
of
the
previous
night
the
narration
was
a
decided
ordeal
to
a
man
of
racksole
s
temperament
a
strange
story
commented
detective
marshall
and
he
could
not
avoid
a
smile
the
climax
was
unfortunate
but
you
have
certainly
got
some
valuable
racksole
said
nothing
i
myself
have
a
clue
added
the
detective
when
your
message
arrived
i
was
just
coming
up
to
see
you
i
want
you
to
accompany
me
to
a
certain
spot
not
far
from
here
will
you
come
now
at
once
with
pleasure
said
racksole
at
that
moment
a
page
entered
with
a
telegram
racksole
opened
it
read
please
come
instantly
nella
hôtel
wellington
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
can
t
come
he
said
to
the
detective
i
m
going
to
to
ostend
yes
but
really
mr
racksole
protested
the
detective
my
business
is
so
s
mine
said
racksole
in
ten
minutes
he
was
on
his
way
to
victoria
station
chapter
fifteen
end
of
the
yacht
adventure
we
must
now
return
to
nella
racksole
and
prince
aribert
of
posen
on
board
the
yacht
without
a
name
the
prince
s
first
business
was
to
make
jules
otherwise
mr
tom
jackson
perfectly
secure
by
means
of
several
pieces
of
rope
although
mr
jackson
had
been
stunned
into
a
complete
unconsciousness
and
there
was
a
contused
wound
under
his
ear
no
one
could
say
how
soon
he
might
not
come
to
himself
and
get
very
violent
so
the
prince
having
tied
his
arms
and
legs
made
him
fast
to
a
stanchion
i
hope
he
won
t
die
said
nella
he
looks
very
the
mr
jacksons
of
this
world
said
prince
aribert
sententiously
never
die
till
they
are
hung
by
the
way
i
wonder
how
it
is
that
no
one
has
interfered
with
us
perhaps
they
are
discreetly
afraid
of
my
revolver
of
your
revolver
i
both
he
and
nella
glanced
up
at
the
imperturbable
steersman
who
kept
the
yacht
s
head
straight
out
to
sea
by
this
time
they
were
about
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
belgian
shore
addressing
him
in
french
the
prince
ordered
the
sailor
to
put
the
yacht
about
and
make
again
for
ostend
harbour
but
the
fellow
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
summons
the
prince
raised
the
revolver
with
the
idea
of
frightening
the
steersman
and
then
the
man
began
to
talk
rapidly
in
a
mixture
of
french
and
flemish
he
said
that
he
had
received
jules
strict
orders
not
to
interfere
in
any
way
no
matter
what
might
happen
on
the
deck
of
the
yacht
he
was
the
captain
of
the
yacht
and
he
had
to
make
for
a
certain
english
port
the
name
of
which
he
could
not
divulge
he
was
to
keep
the
vessel
at
full
steam
ahead
under
any
and
all
circumstances
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
big
a
very
strong
and
a
very
determined
man
and
the
prince
was
at
a
loss
what
course
of
action
to
pursue
he
asked
several
more
questions
but
the
only
effect
of
them
was
to
render
the
man
taciturn
and
in
vain
prince
aribert
explained
that
miss
nella
racksole
daughter
of
millionaire
racksole
had
been
abducted
by
mr
tom
jackson
in
vain
he
flourished
the
revolver
threateningly
the
surly
but
courageous
captain
said
merely
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
he
had
instructions
and
he
should
carry
them
out
he
sarcastically
begged
to
remind
his
interlocutor
that
he
was
the
captain
of
the
yacht
it
won
t
do
to
shoot
him
i
suppose
said
the
prince
to
nella
i
might
bore
a
hole
into
his
leg
or
something
of
that
it
s
rather
risky
and
rather
hard
on
the
poor
captain
with
his
extraordinary
sense
of
duty
said
nella
and
besides
the
whole
crew
might
turn
on
us
no
we
must
think
of
something
i
wonder
where
the
crew
is
said
the
prince
just
then
mr
jackson
prone
and
bound
on
the
deck
showed
signs
of
recovering
from
his
swoon
his
eyes
opened
and
he
gazed
vacantly
around
at
length
he
caught
sight
of
the
prince
who
approached
him
with
the
revolver
well
in
view
it
s
you
is
it
he
murmured
faintly
what
are
you
doing
on
board
who
s
tied
me
up
like
this
see
here
replied
the
prince
i
don
t
want
to
have
any
arguments
but
this
yacht
must
return
to
ostend
at
once
where
you
will
be
given
up
to
the
really
snarled
mr
tom
jackson
shall
i
then
he
called
out
in
french
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
hi
andré
let
these
two
be
put
off
in
the
it
was
a
peculiar
situation
certain
of
nothing
but
the
possession
of
nella
s
revolver
the
prince
scarcely
knew
whether
to
carry
the
argument
further
and
with
stronger
measures
or
to
accept
the
situation
with
as
much
dignity
as
the
circumstances
would
permit
let
us
take
the
dinghy
said
nella
we
can
row
ashore
in
an
he
felt
that
she
was
right
to
leave
the
yacht
in
such
a
manner
seemed
somewhat
ignominious
and
it
certainly
involved
the
escape
of
that
profound
villain
mr
thomas
jackson
but
what
else
could
be
done
the
prince
and
nella
constituted
one
party
on
the
vessel
they
knew
their
own
strength
but
they
did
not
know
the
strength
of
their
opponents
they
held
the
hostile
ringleader
bound
and
captive
but
this
man
had
proved
himself
capable
of
giving
orders
and
even
to
gag
him
would
not
help
them
if
the
captain
of
the
yacht
persisted
in
his
obstinate
course
moreover
there
was
a
distinct
objection
to
promiscuous
shooting
the
prince
felt
that
there
was
no
knowing
how
promiscuous
shooting
might
end
we
will
take
the
dinghy
said
the
prince
quickly
to
the
captain
a
bell
rang
below
and
a
sailor
and
the
negro
boy
appeared
on
deck
the
pulsations
of
the
screw
grew
less
rapid
the
yacht
stopped
the
dinghy
was
lowered
as
the
prince
and
nella
prepared
to
descend
into
the
little
mr
tom
jackson
addressed
nella
all
bound
as
he
lay
he
said
i
shall
see
you
again
never
in
another
moment
they
were
in
the
dinghy
and
the
dinghy
was
adrift
the
yacht
s
screw
churned
the
water
and
the
beautiful
vessel
slipped
away
from
them
as
it
receded
a
figure
appeared
at
the
stem
it
was
mr
thomas
jackson
he
had
been
released
by
his
minions
he
held
a
white
handkerchief
to
his
ear
and
offered
a
calm
enigmatic
smile
to
the
two
forlorn
but
victorious
occupants
of
the
dinghy
jules
had
been
defeated
for
once
in
his
life
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
just
to
say
that
he
had
been
manoeuvred
men
like
jules
are
incapable
of
being
defeated
it
was
characteristic
of
his
luck
that
now
in
the
very
hour
when
he
had
been
caught
in
a
serious
crime
against
society
he
should
be
effecting
a
leisurely
escape
an
escape
which
left
no
clue
behind
the
sea
was
utterly
calm
and
blue
in
the
morning
sun
the
dinghy
rocked
itself
lazily
in
the
swell
of
the
yacht
s
departure
as
the
mist
cleared
away
the
outline
of
the
shore
became
more
distinct
and
it
appeared
as
if
ostend
was
distant
scarcely
a
cable
s
length
the
white
dome
of
the
great
kursaal
glittered
in
the
pale
turquoise
sky
and
the
smoke
of
steamers
in
the
harbour
could
be
plainly
distinguished
on
the
offing
was
a
crowd
of
fishing
luggers
returning
with
the
night
s
catch
the
could
be
counted
on
the
distant
beach
everything
seemed
perfectly
normal
it
was
difficult
for
either
nella
or
her
companion
to
realize
that
anything
extraordinary
had
happened
within
the
last
hour
yet
there
was
the
yacht
not
a
mile
off
to
prove
to
them
that
something
very
extraordinary
had
in
fact
happened
the
yacht
was
no
vision
nor
was
that
sinister
watching
figure
at
its
stern
a
vision
either
i
suppose
jules
was
too
surprised
and
too
feeble
to
inquire
how
i
came
to
be
on
board
his
yacht
said
the
prince
taking
the
oars
oh
how
did
you
asked
nella
her
face
lighting
up
really
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
part
of
the
i
must
begin
at
the
beginning
and
it
will
take
some
time
answered
the
prince
had
we
not
better
postpone
the
recital
till
we
get
ashore
i
will
row
and
you
shall
talk
said
nella
i
want
to
know
he
smiled
happily
at
her
but
gently
declined
to
yield
up
the
oars
is
it
not
sufficient
that
i
am
here
he
said
it
is
sufficient
yes
she
replied
but
i
want
to
with
a
long
easy
stroke
he
was
pulling
the
dinghy
shorewards
she
sat
in
the
there
is
no
rudder
he
remarked
so
you
must
direct
me
keep
the
boat
s
head
on
the
lighthouse
the
tide
seems
to
be
running
in
strongly
that
will
help
us
the
people
on
shore
will
think
that
we
have
only
been
for
a
little
early
morning
will
you
kindly
tell
me
how
it
came
about
that
you
were
able
to
save
my
life
prince
she
said
save
your
life
miss
racksole
i
didn
t
save
your
life
i
merely
knocked
a
man
you
saved
my
life
she
repeated
that
villain
would
have
stopped
at
nothing
i
saw
it
in
his
then
you
were
a
brave
woman
for
you
showed
no
fear
of
his
admiring
gaze
rested
full
on
her
for
a
moment
the
oars
ceased
to
move
she
gave
a
gesture
of
impatience
it
happened
that
i
saw
you
last
night
in
your
carriage
he
said
the
fact
is
i
had
not
had
the
audacity
to
go
to
berlin
with
my
story
i
stopped
in
ostend
to
see
whether
i
could
do
a
little
detective
work
on
my
own
account
it
was
a
piece
of
good
luck
that
i
saw
you
i
followed
the
carriage
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
i
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
as
you
entered
that
awful
house
i
knew
that
jules
had
something
to
do
with
that
house
i
guessed
what
you
were
doing
i
was
afraid
for
you
fortunately
i
had
surveyed
the
house
pretty
thoroughly
there
is
an
entrance
to
it
at
the
back
from
a
narrow
lane
i
made
my
way
there
i
got
into
the
yard
at
the
back
and
i
stood
under
the
window
of
the
room
where
you
had
the
interview
with
miss
spencer
i
heard
everything
that
was
said
it
was
a
courageous
enterprise
on
your
part
to
follow
miss
spencer
from
the
grand
babylon
to
ostend
well
i
dared
not
force
an
entrance
lest
i
might
precipitate
matters
too
suddenly
and
involve
both
of
us
in
a
difficulty
i
merely
kept
watch
ah
miss
racksole
you
were
magnificent
with
miss
spencer
as
i
say
i
could
hear
every
word
for
the
window
was
slightly
open
i
felt
that
you
needed
no
assistance
from
me
and
then
she
cheated
you
with
a
trick
and
the
revolver
came
flying
through
the
window
i
picked
it
up
i
thought
it
would
probably
be
useful
there
was
a
silence
i
did
not
guess
at
first
that
you
had
fainted
i
thought
that
you
had
escaped
when
i
found
out
the
truth
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
intervene
there
were
two
men
both
desperate
besides
miss
spencer
who
was
the
other
man
asked
nella
i
do
not
know
it
was
dark
they
drove
away
with
you
to
the
harbour
again
i
followed
i
saw
them
carry
you
on
board
before
the
yacht
weighed
anchor
i
managed
to
climb
unobserved
into
the
dinghy
i
lay
down
full
length
in
it
and
no
one
suspected
that
i
was
there
i
think
you
know
the
was
the
yacht
all
ready
for
sea
the
yacht
was
all
ready
for
sea
the
captain
fellow
was
on
the
bridge
and
steam
was
then
they
expected
me
how
could
that
be
they
expected
some
one
i
do
not
think
they
expected
did
the
second
man
go
on
board
he
helped
to
carry
you
along
the
gangway
but
he
came
back
again
to
the
carriage
he
was
the
and
no
one
else
saw
the
business
the
quay
was
deserted
you
see
the
last
steamer
had
arrived
for
the
there
was
a
brief
silence
and
then
nella
ejaculated
under
her
breath
truly
it
is
a
wonderful
world
and
it
was
a
wonderful
world
for
them
though
scarcely
perhaps
in
the
sense
which
nella
racksole
had
intended
they
had
just
emerged
from
a
highly
disconcerting
experience
among
other
minor
inconveniences
they
had
had
no
breakfast
they
were
out
in
the
sea
in
a
tiny
boat
neither
of
them
knew
what
the
day
might
bring
forth
the
man
at
least
had
the
most
serious
anxieties
for
the
safety
of
his
royal
nephew
and
yet
and
yet
neither
of
them
wished
that
that
voyage
of
the
little
boat
on
the
summer
tide
should
come
to
an
end
each
perhaps
unconsciously
had
a
vague
desire
that
it
might
last
for
ever
he
lazily
pulling
she
directing
his
course
at
intervals
by
a
movement
of
her
distractingly
pretty
head
how
was
this
condition
of
affairs
to
be
explained
well
they
were
both
young
they
both
had
superb
health
and
all
the
ardour
of
youth
and
they
were
together
the
boat
was
very
small
indeed
her
face
was
scarcely
a
yard
from
his
she
in
his
eyes
surrounded
by
the
glamour
of
beauty
and
vast
wealth
he
in
her
eyes
surrounded
by
the
glamour
of
masculine
intrepidity
and
the
brilliance
of
a
throne
but
all
voyages
come
to
an
end
either
at
the
shore
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
at
length
the
dinghy
passed
between
the
stone
jetties
of
the
harbour
the
prince
rowed
to
the
nearest
steps
tied
up
the
boat
and
they
landed
it
was
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
a
day
of
gorgeous
sunlight
had
opened
few
people
were
about
at
that
early
hour
and
now
what
next
said
the
prince
i
must
take
you
to
an
i
am
in
your
hands
she
acquiesced
with
a
smile
which
sent
the
blood
racing
through
his
veins
he
perceived
now
that
she
was
tired
and
overcome
suffering
from
a
sudden
and
natural
reaction
at
the
hôtel
wellington
the
prince
told
the
sleepy
that
they
had
come
by
the
early
train
from
bruges
and
wanted
breakfast
at
once
it
was
absurdly
early
but
a
common
english
sovereign
will
work
wonders
in
any
belgian
hotel
and
in
a
very
brief
time
nella
and
the
prince
were
breakfasting
on
the
verandah
of
the
hotel
upon
chocolate
that
had
been
specially
and
hastily
brewed
for
them
i
never
tasted
such
excellent
chocolate
claimed
the
prince
the
statement
was
wildly
untrue
for
the
hôtel
wellington
is
not
celebrated
for
its
chocolate
nevertheless
nella
replied
enthusiastically
nor
then
there
was
a
silence
and
nella
feeling
possibly
that
she
had
been
too
ecstatic
remarked
in
a
very
tone
i
must
telegraph
to
papa
thus
it
was
that
theodore
racksole
received
the
telegram
which
drew
him
away
from
detective
marshall
chapter
sixteen
the
woman
with
the
red
hat
there
is
one
thing
prince
that
we
have
just
got
to
settle
straight
off
said
theodore
racksole
they
were
all
three
seated
racksole
his
daughter
and
prince
aribert
round
a
dinner
table
in
a
private
room
at
the
hôtel
wellington
racksole
had
duly
arrived
by
the
afternoon
boat
and
had
been
met
on
the
quay
by
the
other
two
they
had
dined
early
and
racksole
had
heard
the
full
story
of
the
adventures
by
sea
and
land
of
nella
and
the
prince
as
to
his
own
adventure
of
the
previous
night
he
said
very
little
merely
explaining
with
as
little
detail
as
possible
that
dimmock
s
body
had
come
to
light
what
is
that
asked
the
prince
in
answer
to
racksole
s
remark
we
have
got
to
settle
whether
we
shall
tell
the
police
at
once
all
that
has
occurred
or
whether
we
shall
proceed
on
our
own
responsibility
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
which
course
we
ought
to
pursue
every
consideration
of
prudence
points
to
the
advisability
of
taking
the
police
into
our
confidence
and
leaving
the
matter
entirely
in
their
oh
papa
nella
burst
out
in
her
pouting
impulsive
way
you
surely
can
t
think
of
such
a
thing
why
the
fun
has
only
just
do
you
call
last
night
fun
questioned
racksole
gazing
at
her
solemnly
yes
i
do
she
said
promptly
well
i
don
t
was
the
millionaire
s
laconic
response
but
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
situation
in
the
lift
do
you
not
think
we
might
investigate
a
little
further
said
the
prince
judiciously
as
he
cracked
a
walnut
just
a
little
further
and
then
if
we
fail
to
accomplish
anything
there
would
still
be
ample
opportunity
to
consult
the
police
how
do
you
suggest
we
should
begin
asked
racksole
well
there
is
the
house
which
miss
racksole
so
intrepidly
entered
last
evening
he
gave
her
the
homage
of
an
admiring
glance
you
and
i
mr
racksole
might
examine
that
abode
in
certainly
we
might
do
we
might
do
too
for
example
we
might
shoot
someone
or
get
ourselves
mistaken
for
burglars
if
we
outstepped
the
law
it
would
be
no
excuse
for
us
that
we
had
been
acting
in
a
good
true
said
the
prince
nevertheless
he
stopped
nevertheless
you
have
a
distaste
for
bringing
the
police
into
the
business
you
want
the
hunt
all
to
yourself
you
are
on
fire
with
the
ardour
of
the
chase
is
not
that
it
accept
the
advice
of
an
older
man
prince
and
sleep
on
this
affair
i
have
little
fancy
for
nocturnal
escapades
two
nights
together
as
for
you
nella
off
with
you
to
bed
the
prince
and
i
will
have
a
yarn
over
such
fluids
as
can
be
obtained
in
this
papa
she
said
you
are
perfectly
horrid
perhaps
i
am
he
said
decidedly
i
am
very
cross
with
you
for
coming
over
here
all
alone
it
was
monstrous
if
i
didn
t
happen
to
be
the
most
foolish
of
parents
there
it
s
nine
o
clock
the
prince
i
am
sure
will
excuse
if
nella
had
not
really
been
very
tired
prince
aribert
might
have
been
the
witness
of
a
but
stubborn
conflict
between
the
millionaire
and
his
spirited
offspring
as
it
was
nella
departed
with
surprising
docility
and
the
two
men
were
left
alone
now
said
racksole
suddenly
changing
his
tone
i
fancy
that
after
all
i
m
your
man
for
a
little
amateur
investigation
and
if
i
must
speak
the
exact
truth
i
think
that
to
sleep
on
this
affair
would
be
about
the
very
worst
thing
we
could
do
but
i
was
anxious
to
keep
nella
out
of
harm
s
way
at
any
rate
till
she
is
a
very
difficult
creature
to
manage
prince
and
i
may
warn
you
he
laughed
grimly
that
if
we
do
succeed
in
doing
anything
we
shall
catch
it
from
her
ladyship
in
the
morning
are
you
ready
to
take
that
risk
i
am
the
prince
smiled
but
miss
racksole
is
a
young
lady
of
quite
remarkable
she
is
said
racksole
drily
i
wish
sometimes
she
had
i
have
the
highest
admiration
for
miss
racksole
said
the
prince
and
he
looked
miss
racksole
s
father
full
in
the
face
you
honour
us
prince
racksole
observed
let
us
come
to
business
am
i
right
in
assuming
that
you
have
a
reason
for
keeping
the
police
out
of
this
business
if
it
can
possibly
be
done
yes
said
the
prince
and
his
brow
clouded
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
my
poor
nephew
has
involved
himself
in
some
scrape
that
he
would
wish
not
to
be
then
you
do
not
believe
that
he
is
the
victim
of
foul
play
i
do
and
the
reason
if
i
may
ask
it
mr
racksole
we
speak
in
confidence
is
it
not
so
some
years
ago
my
foolish
nephew
had
an
affair
an
affair
with
a
feminine
star
of
the
berlin
stage
for
anything
i
know
the
lady
may
have
been
the
very
pattern
of
her
sex
but
where
a
reigning
prince
is
concerned
scandal
can
not
be
avoided
in
such
a
matter
i
had
thought
that
the
affair
was
quite
at
an
end
since
my
nephew
s
betrothal
to
princess
anna
of
is
shortly
to
be
announced
but
yesterday
i
saw
the
lady
to
whom
i
have
referred
driving
on
the
digue
the
coincidence
of
her
presence
here
with
my
nephew
s
disappearance
is
too
extraordinary
to
be
but
how
does
this
theory
square
with
the
murder
of
reginald
dimmock
it
does
not
square
with
it
my
idea
is
that
the
murder
of
poor
dimmock
and
the
disappearance
of
my
nephew
are
entirely
unconnected
unless
indeed
this
berlin
actress
is
playing
into
the
hands
of
the
murderers
i
had
not
thought
of
then
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
propose
to
enter
the
house
which
miss
racksole
entered
last
night
and
to
find
out
something
i
concur
said
racksole
i
shall
heartily
enjoy
it
but
let
me
tell
you
prince
and
pardon
me
for
speaking
bluntly
your
surmise
is
incorrect
i
would
wager
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
prince
eugen
has
been
what
grounds
have
you
for
being
so
sure
ah
said
racksole
that
is
a
long
story
let
me
begin
by
asking
you
this
are
you
aware
that
your
nephew
prince
eugen
owes
a
million
of
money
a
million
of
money
cried
prince
aribert
astonished
it
is
impossible
nevertheless
he
does
said
racksole
calmly
then
he
told
him
all
he
had
learnt
from
mr
sampson
levi
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
racksole
ended
prince
aribert
made
no
reply
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
racksole
insisted
merely
that
eugen
is
ruined
even
if
he
is
not
at
all
racksole
returned
with
cheerfulness
not
at
all
we
shall
see
about
that
the
special
thing
that
i
want
to
know
just
now
from
you
is
this
has
any
previous
application
ever
been
made
for
the
hand
of
the
princess
anna
yes
last
year
the
king
of
bosnia
sued
for
it
but
his
proposal
was
why
because
my
nephew
was
considered
to
be
a
more
suitable
match
for
not
because
the
personal
character
of
his
majesty
of
bosnia
is
scarcely
of
the
brightest
no
unfortunately
it
is
usually
impossible
to
consider
questions
of
personal
character
when
a
royal
match
is
then
if
for
any
reason
the
marriage
of
princess
anna
with
your
nephew
was
frustrated
the
king
of
bosnia
would
have
a
fair
chance
in
that
quarter
he
would
the
political
aspect
of
things
would
be
perfectly
thanks
said
racksole
i
will
wager
another
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
someone
in
bosnia
i
don
t
accuse
the
king
himself
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
business
the
methods
of
balkan
politicians
have
always
been
let
us
where
to
this
precious
house
of
nella
s
but
surely
it
is
too
early
so
it
is
said
racksole
and
we
shall
want
a
few
things
too
for
instance
a
dark
lantern
i
think
i
will
go
out
and
forage
for
a
and
a
revolver
suggested
prince
aribert
does
it
mean
revolvers
the
millionaire
laughed
it
may
come
to
here
you
are
then
my
friend
said
racksole
and
he
pulled
one
out
of
his
hip
pocket
and
yours
i
said
the
prince
i
have
your
daughter
the
deuce
you
have
murmured
racksole
to
himself
it
was
then
half
past
nine
they
decided
that
it
would
be
impolitic
to
begin
their
operations
till
after
midnight
there
were
three
hours
to
spare
let
us
go
and
see
the
gambling
racksole
suggested
we
might
encounter
the
berlin
the
suggestion
in
the
first
instance
was
not
made
seriously
but
it
appeared
to
both
men
that
they
might
do
worse
than
spend
the
intervening
time
in
the
gorgeous
saloon
of
the
kursaal
where
in
the
season
as
much
money
is
won
and
lost
as
at
monte
carlo
it
was
striking
ten
o
clock
as
they
entered
the
rooms
there
was
a
large
company
present
a
company
which
included
some
of
the
most
notorious
persons
in
europe
in
that
multifarious
assemblage
all
were
equal
the
electric
light
shone
coldly
and
impartially
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
on
the
fool
and
the
knave
on
the
european
and
the
asiatic
as
usual
women
monopolized
the
best
places
at
the
tables
the
scene
was
familiar
enough
to
prince
aribert
who
had
witnessed
it
frequently
at
monaco
but
theodore
racksole
had
never
before
entered
any
european
gaming
palace
he
had
only
the
haziest
idea
of
the
rules
of
play
and
he
was
at
once
interested
for
some
time
they
watched
the
play
at
the
table
which
happened
to
be
nearest
to
them
racksole
never
moved
his
lips
with
his
eyes
glued
on
the
table
and
ears
open
for
every
remark
of
the
players
and
the
croupier
he
took
his
first
lesson
in
roulette
he
saw
a
mere
youth
win
fifteen
thousand
francs
which
were
stolen
in
the
most
barefaced
manner
by
a
rouged
girl
scarcely
older
than
the
youth
he
saw
two
old
gamesters
stake
their
coins
and
lose
and
walk
quietly
out
of
the
place
he
saw
the
bank
win
fifty
thousand
francs
at
a
single
turn
this
is
rather
good
fun
he
said
at
length
but
the
stakes
are
too
small
to
make
it
really
exciting
i
ll
try
my
luck
just
for
the
experience
i
m
bound
to
why
asked
the
prince
because
i
always
do
in
games
of
chance
racksole
answered
with
gay
confidence
it
is
my
fate
then
you
must
remember
i
shall
be
a
beginner
and
you
know
the
tyro
s
in
ten
minutes
the
croupier
of
that
table
was
obliged
to
suspend
operations
pending
the
arrival
of
a
further
supply
of
coin
what
did
i
tell
you
said
racksole
leading
the
way
to
another
table
further
up
the
room
a
hundred
curious
glances
went
after
him
one
old
woman
whose
gay
attire
suggested
a
false
youthfulness
begged
him
in
french
to
stake
a
piece
for
her
she
offered
him
the
coin
he
took
it
and
gave
her
a
note
in
exchange
she
clutched
the
crisp
rustling
paper
and
with
hysterical
haste
scuttled
back
to
her
own
table
at
the
second
table
there
was
a
considerable
air
of
excitement
in
the
forefront
of
the
players
was
a
woman
in
a
evening
dress
of
black
silk
and
a
large
red
picture
hat
her
age
appeared
to
be
about
eight
she
had
dark
eyes
full
lips
and
a
distinctly
jewish
nose
she
was
handsome
but
her
beauty
was
of
that
forbidding
sinister
order
which
is
often
called
junoesque
this
woman
was
the
centre
of
attraction
people
said
to
each
other
that
she
had
won
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
that
day
at
the
table
you
were
right
prince
aribert
whispered
to
theodore
racksole
that
is
the
berlin
the
deuce
she
is
has
she
seen
you
will
she
know
you
she
would
probably
know
me
but
she
hasn
t
looked
up
keep
behind
her
then
i
propose
to
find
her
a
little
by
dint
of
a
diplomacy
racksole
manoeuvred
himself
into
a
seat
opposite
to
the
lady
in
the
red
hat
the
fame
of
his
success
at
the
other
table
had
followed
him
and
people
regarded
him
as
a
serious
and
formidable
player
in
the
first
turn
the
lady
put
a
thousand
francs
on
double
zero
racksole
put
a
hundred
on
number
nineteen
and
a
thousand
on
the
odd
numbers
nineteen
won
racksole
received
four
thousand
four
hundred
francs
nine
times
in
succession
racksole
backed
number
nineteen
and
the
odd
numbers
nine
times
the
lady
backed
double
zero
nine
times
racksole
won
and
the
lady
lost
the
other
players
perceiving
that
the
affair
had
resolved
itself
into
a
duel
stood
back
for
the
most
part
and
watched
those
two
prince
aribert
never
stirred
from
his
position
behind
the
great
red
hat
the
game
continued
racksole
lost
trifles
from
time
to
time
but
nine
hundredths
of
the
luck
was
with
him
as
an
english
spectator
at
the
table
remarked
he
couldn
t
do
when
midnight
struck
the
lady
in
the
red
hat
was
reduced
to
a
thousand
francs
then
she
fell
into
a
winning
vein
for
half
an
hour
but
at
one
o
clock
her
resources
were
exhausted
of
the
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
which
she
was
reputed
to
have
had
early
in
the
evening
racksole
held
about
ninety
thousand
and
the
bank
had
the
rest
it
was
a
calamity
for
the
juno
of
the
red
hat
she
jumped
up
stamped
her
foot
and
hurried
from
the
room
at
a
discreet
distance
racksole
and
the
prince
pursued
her
it
might
be
well
to
ascertain
her
movements
said
racksole
outside
in
the
glare
of
the
great
arc
lights
and
within
sound
of
the
surf
which
beats
always
at
the
very
foot
of
the
kursaal
the
juno
of
the
red
hat
summoned
a
fiacre
and
drove
rapidly
away
racksole
and
the
prince
took
an
open
carriage
and
started
in
pursuit
they
had
not
however
travelled
more
than
half
a
mile
when
prince
aribert
stopped
the
carriage
and
bidding
racksole
get
out
paid
the
driver
and
dismissed
him
i
feel
sure
i
know
where
she
is
going
he
explained
and
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
follow
on
you
mean
she
is
making
for
the
scene
of
last
night
s
affair
said
racksole
exactly
we
shall
what
you
call
kill
two
birds
with
one
prince
aribert
s
guess
was
correct
the
lady
s
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
where
nella
racksole
and
miss
spencer
had
had
their
interview
on
the
previous
evening
and
the
lady
vanished
into
the
building
just
as
the
two
men
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
street
instead
of
proceeding
along
that
street
the
prince
led
racksole
to
the
lane
which
gave
on
to
the
backs
of
the
houses
and
he
counted
the
houses
as
they
went
up
the
lane
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
burglariously
climbed
over
a
wall
and
crept
with
infinite
caution
up
a
long
narrow
piece
of
ground
half
garden
half
paved
yard
till
they
crouched
under
a
window
a
window
which
was
shielded
by
curtains
but
which
had
been
left
open
a
little
listen
said
the
prince
in
his
lightest
whisper
they
are
who
the
berlin
lady
and
miss
spencer
i
m
sure
it
s
miss
spencer
s
racksole
boldly
pushed
the
french
window
a
little
wider
open
and
put
his
ear
to
the
aperture
through
which
came
a
beam
of
yellow
light
take
my
place
he
whispered
to
the
prince
they
re
talking
german
you
ll
understand
silently
they
exchanged
places
under
the
window
and
the
prince
listened
intently
then
you
refuse
miss
spencer
s
visitor
was
saying
there
was
no
answer
from
miss
spencer
not
even
a
thousand
francs
i
tell
you
i
ve
lost
the
whole
again
no
answer
then
i
ll
tell
the
whole
story
the
lady
went
on
in
an
angry
rush
of
words
i
did
what
i
promised
to
do
i
enticed
him
here
and
you
ve
got
him
safe
in
your
vile
cellar
poor
little
man
and
you
won
t
give
me
a
paltry
thousand
you
have
already
had
your
the
words
were
miss
spencer
s
they
fell
cold
and
calm
on
the
night
air
i
want
another
i
haven
t
then
we
ll
prince
aribert
heard
a
rustle
of
flying
skirts
then
another
movement
a
door
banged
and
the
beam
of
light
through
the
aperture
of
the
window
suddenly
disappeared
he
pushed
the
window
wide
open
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
apparently
empty
now
for
that
lantern
of
yours
he
said
eagerly
to
theodore
racksole
after
he
had
translated
to
him
the
conversation
of
the
two
women
racksole
produced
the
dark
lantern
from
the
capacious
pocket
of
his
dust
coat
and
lighted
it
the
ray
flashed
about
the
ground
what
is
it
exclaimed
prince
aribert
with
a
swift
cry
pointing
to
the
ground
the
lantern
threw
its
light
on
a
perpendicular
grating
at
their
feet
through
which
could
be
discerned
a
cellar
they
both
knelt
down
and
peered
into
the
subterranean
chamber
on
a
broken
chair
a
young
man
sat
listlessly
with
closed
eyes
his
head
leaning
heavily
forward
on
his
chest
in
the
feeble
light
of
the
lantern
he
had
the
livid
and
ghastly
appearance
of
a
corpse
who
can
it
be
said
racksole
it
is
eugen
was
the
prince
s
low
answer
chapter
seventeen
the
release
of
prince
eugen
eugen
prince
aribert
called
softly
at
the
sound
of
his
own
name
the
young
man
in
the
cellar
feebly
raised
his
head
and
stared
up
at
the
grating
which
separated
him
from
his
two
rescuers
but
his
features
showed
no
recognition
he
gazed
in
an
aimless
vague
silly
manner
for
a
few
seconds
his
eyes
blinking
under
the
glare
of
the
lantern
and
then
his
head
slowly
drooped
again
on
to
his
chest
he
was
dressed
in
a
dark
tweed
travelling
suit
and
racksole
observed
that
one
sleeve
the
left
was
torn
across
the
upper
part
of
the
cuff
and
that
there
were
stains
of
dirt
on
the
left
shoulder
a
soiled
linen
collar
which
had
lost
all
its
starch
and
was
half
unbuttoned
partially
encircled
the
captive
s
neck
his
brown
boots
were
unlaced
a
cap
a
handkerchief
a
portion
of
a
and
a
few
gold
coins
lay
on
the
floor
racksole
flashed
the
lantern
into
the
corners
of
the
cellar
but
he
could
discover
no
other
furniture
except
the
chair
on
which
the
hereditary
prince
of
posen
sat
and
a
small
deal
table
on
which
were
a
plate
and
a
cup
eugen
cried
prince
aribert
once
more
but
this
time
his
forlorn
nephew
made
no
response
whatever
and
then
aribert
added
in
a
low
voice
to
racksole
perhaps
he
can
not
see
us
but
he
must
surely
recognize
your
voice
said
racksole
in
a
hard
gloomy
tone
there
was
a
pause
and
the
two
men
above
ground
looked
at
each
other
hesitatingly
each
knew
that
they
must
enter
that
cellar
and
get
prince
eugen
out
of
it
and
each
was
somehow
afraid
to
take
the
next
step
thank
god
he
is
not
dead
said
aribert
he
may
be
worse
than
dead
racksole
replied
worse
than
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
he
may
be
come
aribert
almost
shouted
with
a
sudden
access
of
energy
a
wild
impulse
for
action
and
snatching
the
lantern
from
racksole
he
rushed
into
the
dark
room
where
they
had
heard
the
conversation
of
miss
spencer
and
the
lady
in
the
red
hat
for
a
moment
racksole
did
not
stir
from
the
threshold
of
the
window
come
prince
aribert
repeated
and
there
was
an
imperious
command
in
his
utterance
what
are
you
afraid
of
i
don
t
know
said
racksole
feeling
stupid
and
queer
i
don
t
then
he
marched
heavily
after
prince
aribert
into
the
room
on
the
mantelpiece
were
a
couple
of
candles
which
had
been
blown
out
and
in
a
mechanical
unthinking
way
racksole
lighted
them
and
the
two
men
glanced
round
the
room
it
presented
no
peculiar
features
it
was
just
an
ordinary
room
rather
small
rather
mean
rather
shabby
with
an
ugly
wallpaper
and
ugly
pictures
in
ugly
frames
thrown
over
a
chair
was
a
man
s
jacket
the
door
was
closed
prince
aribert
turned
the
knob
but
he
could
not
open
it
it
s
locked
he
said
evidently
they
know
we
re
nonsense
said
racksole
brusquely
how
can
they
know
and
taking
hold
of
the
knob
he
violently
shook
the
door
and
it
opened
i
told
you
it
wasn
t
locked
he
added
and
this
small
success
of
opening
the
door
seemed
to
steady
the
man
it
was
a
curious
psychological
effect
this
terrorizing
for
it
amounted
to
that
of
two
courageous
men
by
the
mere
apparition
of
a
helpless
creature
in
a
cellar
gradually
they
both
recovered
from
it
the
next
moment
they
were
out
in
the
passage
which
led
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
the
front
door
stood
open
they
looked
into
the
street
up
and
down
but
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
the
street
lighted
by
three
only
seemed
strangely
sinister
and
mysterious
she
has
gone
that
s
clear
said
racksole
meaning
the
woman
with
the
red
hat
and
miss
spencer
after
her
do
you
think
questioned
aribert
no
she
would
stay
she
would
never
dare
to
leave
let
us
find
the
cellar
the
cellar
steps
were
happily
not
difficult
to
discover
for
in
moving
a
pace
backwards
prince
aribert
had
a
narrow
escape
of
precipitating
himself
to
the
bottom
of
them
the
lantern
showed
that
they
were
built
on
a
curve
silently
racksole
resumed
possession
of
the
lantern
and
went
first
the
prince
close
behind
him
at
the
foot
was
a
short
passage
and
in
this
passage
crouched
the
figure
of
a
woman
her
eyes
threw
back
the
rays
of
the
lantern
shining
like
a
cat
s
at
midnight
then
as
the
men
went
nearer
they
saw
that
it
was
miss
spencer
who
barred
their
way
she
seemed
half
to
kneel
on
the
stone
floor
and
in
one
hand
she
held
what
at
first
appeared
to
be
a
dagger
but
which
proved
to
be
nothing
more
romantic
than
a
rather
long
i
heard
you
i
heard
you
she
exclaimed
get
back
you
mustn
t
come
there
was
a
desperate
and
dangerous
look
on
her
face
and
her
form
shook
with
scarcely
controlled
passionate
energy
now
see
here
miss
spencer
racksole
said
calmly
i
guess
we
ve
had
enough
of
this
fandango
you
d
better
get
up
and
clear
out
or
we
ll
just
have
to
drag
you
he
went
calmly
up
to
her
the
lantern
in
his
hand
without
another
word
she
struck
the
knife
into
his
arm
and
the
lantern
fell
extinguished
racksole
gave
a
cry
rather
of
angry
surprise
than
of
pain
and
retreated
a
few
steps
in
the
darkness
they
could
still
perceive
the
glint
of
her
eyes
i
told
you
you
mustn
t
come
here
the
woman
said
now
get
racksole
positively
laughed
it
was
a
queer
laugh
but
he
laughed
and
he
could
not
help
it
the
idea
of
this
woman
this
bureau
clerk
stopping
his
progress
and
that
of
prince
aribert
by
means
of
a
knife
aroused
his
sense
of
humour
he
struck
a
match
relighted
the
candle
and
faced
miss
spencer
once
more
i
ll
do
it
again
she
said
with
a
note
of
hard
resolve
oh
no
you
won
t
my
girl
said
racksole
and
he
pulled
out
his
revolver
cocked
it
raised
his
hand
put
down
that
plaything
of
yours
he
said
firmly
no
she
answered
i
shall
she
pressed
her
lips
together
i
shall
shoot
he
repeated
one
two
bang
bang
he
had
fired
twice
purposely
missing
her
miss
spencer
never
blenched
racksole
was
tremendously
surprised
and
he
would
have
been
a
thousandfold
more
surprised
could
he
have
contrasted
her
behaviour
now
with
her
abject
terror
on
the
previous
evening
when
nella
had
threatened
her
you
ve
got
a
bit
of
pluck
he
said
but
it
won
t
help
you
why
won
t
you
let
us
pass
as
a
matter
of
fact
pluck
was
just
what
she
had
not
really
she
had
merely
subordinated
one
terror
to
another
she
was
desperately
afraid
of
racksole
s
revolver
but
she
was
much
more
afraid
of
something
else
why
won
t
you
let
us
pass
i
daren
t
she
said
with
a
plaintive
tremor
tom
put
me
in
that
was
all
the
men
could
see
tears
running
down
her
poor
wrinkled
face
theodore
racksole
began
to
take
off
his
light
overcoat
i
see
i
must
take
my
coat
off
to
you
he
said
and
he
almost
smiled
then
with
a
quick
movement
he
threw
the
coat
over
miss
spencer
s
head
and
flew
at
her
seizing
both
her
arms
while
prince
aribert
assisted
her
struggles
ceased
she
was
beaten
that
s
all
right
said
racksole
i
could
never
have
used
that
revolver
to
mean
business
with
it
of
they
carried
her
unresisting
upstairs
and
on
to
the
upper
floor
where
they
locked
her
in
a
bedroom
she
lay
in
the
bed
as
if
exhausted
now
for
my
poor
eugen
said
prince
aribert
don
t
you
think
we
d
better
search
the
house
first
racksole
suggested
it
will
be
safer
to
know
just
how
we
stand
we
can
t
afford
any
ambushes
or
things
of
that
kind
you
the
prince
agreed
and
they
searched
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
but
found
no
one
then
having
locked
the
front
door
and
the
french
window
of
the
they
proceeded
again
to
the
cellar
here
a
new
obstacle
confronted
them
the
cellar
door
was
of
course
locked
there
was
no
sign
of
a
key
and
it
appeared
to
be
a
heavy
door
they
were
compelled
to
return
to
the
bedroom
where
miss
spencer
was
incarcerated
in
order
to
demand
the
key
of
the
cellar
from
her
she
still
lay
without
movement
on
the
bed
tom
s
got
it
she
replied
faintly
to
their
question
tom
s
got
it
i
swear
to
you
he
took
it
for
then
how
do
you
feed
your
prisoner
racksole
asked
sharply
through
the
grating
she
answered
both
men
shuddered
they
felt
she
was
speaking
the
truth
for
the
third
time
they
went
to
the
cellar
door
in
vain
racksole
thrust
himself
against
it
he
could
do
no
more
than
shake
it
let
s
try
both
together
said
prince
aribert
now
there
was
a
crack
again
said
prince
aribert
there
was
another
crack
and
then
the
upper
hinge
gave
way
the
rest
was
easy
over
the
wreck
of
the
door
they
entered
prince
eugen
s
prison
the
captive
still
sat
on
his
chair
the
terrific
noise
and
bustle
of
breaking
down
the
door
seemed
not
to
have
aroused
him
from
his
lethargy
but
when
prince
aribert
spoke
to
him
in
german
he
looked
at
his
uncle
will
you
not
come
with
us
eugen
said
prince
aribert
you
needn
t
stay
here
any
longer
you
leave
me
alone
was
the
strange
reply
leave
me
alone
what
do
you
want
we
are
here
to
get
you
out
of
this
scrape
said
aribert
gently
racksole
stood
aside
who
is
that
fellow
said
eugen
sharply
that
is
my
friend
mr
racksole
an
englishman
or
rather
i
should
say
an
american
to
whom
we
owe
a
great
deal
come
and
have
supper
i
won
t
answered
eugen
doggedly
i
m
waiting
here
for
her
you
didn
t
think
anyone
had
kept
me
here
did
you
against
my
will
i
tell
you
i
m
waiting
for
her
she
said
she
d
who
is
she
aribert
asked
humouring
him
she
why
you
know
i
forgot
of
course
you
don
t
know
you
mustn
t
ask
don
t
pry
uncle
aribert
she
was
wearing
a
red
i
ll
take
you
to
her
my
dear
prince
aribert
put
his
hands
on
the
other
s
shoulder
but
eugen
shook
him
off
violently
stood
up
and
then
sat
down
again
aribert
looked
at
racksole
and
they
both
looked
at
prince
eugen
the
latter
s
face
was
flushed
and
racksole
observed
that
the
left
pupil
was
more
dilated
than
the
right
the
man
started
muttered
odd
fragmentary
scraps
of
sentences
now
grumbling
now
whining
his
mind
is
unhinged
racksole
whispered
in
english
hush
said
prince
aribert
he
understands
but
prince
eugen
took
no
notice
of
the
brief
colloquy
we
had
better
get
him
upstairs
somehow
said
racksole
yes
aribert
assented
eugen
the
lady
with
the
red
hat
the
lady
you
are
waiting
for
is
upstairs
she
has
sent
us
down
to
ask
you
to
come
up
won
t
you
come
himmel
the
poor
fellow
exclaimed
with
a
kind
of
weak
anger
why
did
you
not
say
this
before
he
rose
staggered
towards
aribert
and
fell
headlong
on
the
floor
he
had
swooned
the
two
men
raised
him
carried
him
up
the
stone
steps
and
laid
him
with
infinite
care
on
a
sofa
he
lay
breathing
queerly
through
the
nostrils
his
eyes
closed
his
fingers
contracted
every
now
and
then
a
convulsion
ran
through
his
frame
one
of
us
must
fetch
a
doctor
said
prince
aribert
i
will
said
racksole
at
that
moment
there
was
a
quick
curt
rap
on
the
french
window
and
both
racksole
and
the
prince
glanced
round
startled
a
girl
s
face
was
pressed
against
the
large
it
was
nella
s
racksole
unfastened
the
catch
and
she
entered
i
have
found
you
she
said
lightly
you
might
have
told
me
i
couldn
t
sleep
i
inquired
from
the
if
you
had
retired
and
they
said
no
so
i
slipped
out
i
guessed
where
you
racksole
interrupted
her
with
a
question
as
to
what
she
meant
by
this
escapade
but
she
stopped
him
with
a
careless
gesture
what
s
this
she
pointed
to
the
form
on
the
sofa
that
is
my
nephew
prince
eugen
said
aribert
hurt
she
inquired
coldly
i
hope
he
is
ill
said
racksole
his
brain
is
nella
began
to
examine
the
unconscious
prince
with
the
expert
movements
of
a
girl
who
had
passed
through
the
best
hospital
course
to
be
obtained
in
new
york
he
has
got
brain
fever
she
said
that
is
all
but
it
will
be
enough
do
you
know
if
there
is
a
bed
anywhere
in
this
remarkable
house
chapter
eighteen
in
the
he
must
on
no
account
be
moved
said
the
dark
little
belgian
doctor
whose
eyes
seemed
to
peer
so
quizzically
through
his
spectacles
and
he
said
it
with
much
positiveness
that
pronouncement
rather
settled
their
plans
for
them
it
was
certainly
a
professional
triumph
for
nella
who
previous
to
the
doctor
s
arrival
had
told
them
the
very
same
thing
considerable
argument
had
passed
before
the
doctor
was
sent
for
prince
aribert
was
for
keeping
the
whole
affair
a
deep
secret
among
their
three
selves
theodore
racksole
agreed
so
far
but
he
suggested
further
that
at
no
matter
what
risk
they
should
transport
the
patient
over
to
england
at
once
racksole
had
an
idea
that
he
should
feel
safer
in
that
hotel
of
his
and
better
able
to
deal
with
any
situation
that
might
arise
nella
scorned
the
idea
in
her
quality
of
an
amateur
nurse
she
assured
them
that
prince
eugen
was
much
more
seriously
ill
than
either
of
them
suspected
and
she
urged
that
they
should
take
absolute
possession
of
the
house
and
keep
possession
till
prince
eugen
was
convalescent
but
what
about
the
spencer
female
racksole
had
said
keep
her
where
she
is
keep
her
a
prisoner
and
hold
the
house
against
all
comers
if
jules
should
come
back
simply
defy
him
to
enter
that
is
all
there
are
two
of
you
so
you
must
keep
an
eye
on
the
former
occupiers
if
they
return
and
on
miss
spencer
while
i
nurse
the
patient
but
first
you
must
send
for
a
doctor
prince
aribert
had
said
alarmed
will
it
not
be
necessary
to
make
some
awkward
explanation
to
the
doctor
not
at
all
she
replied
why
should
it
be
in
a
place
like
ostend
doctors
are
far
too
discreet
to
ask
questions
they
see
too
much
to
retain
their
curiosity
besides
do
you
want
your
nephew
to
die
both
the
men
were
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
girl
s
sagacious
grasp
of
the
situation
and
it
came
about
that
they
began
to
obey
her
like
subordinates
she
told
her
father
to
sally
forth
in
search
of
a
doctor
and
he
went
she
gave
prince
aribert
certain
other
orders
and
he
promptly
executed
them
by
the
evening
of
the
following
day
everything
was
going
smoothly
the
doctor
came
and
departed
several
times
and
sent
medicine
and
seemed
fairly
optimistic
as
to
the
issue
of
the
illness
an
old
woman
had
been
induced
to
come
in
and
cook
and
clean
miss
spencer
was
kept
out
of
sight
on
the
attic
floor
pending
some
decision
as
to
what
to
do
with
her
and
no
one
outside
the
house
had
asked
any
questions
the
inhabitants
of
that
particular
street
must
have
been
accustomed
to
strange
behaviour
on
the
part
of
their
neighbours
unaccountable
appearances
and
disappearances
strange
flittings
and
arrivals
this
and
active
trio
racksole
nella
and
prince
aribert
might
have
been
the
lawful
and
accustomed
tenants
of
the
house
for
any
outward
evidence
to
the
contrary
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
prince
eugen
was
distinctly
and
seriously
worse
nella
had
sat
up
with
him
the
previous
night
and
throughout
the
day
her
father
had
spent
the
morning
at
the
hotel
and
prince
aribert
had
kept
watch
the
two
men
were
never
absent
from
the
house
at
the
same
time
and
one
of
them
always
did
duty
as
sentinel
at
night
on
this
afternoon
prince
aribert
and
nella
sat
together
in
the
patient
s
bedroom
the
doctor
had
just
left
theodore
racksole
was
downstairs
reading
the
new
york
herald
the
prince
and
nella
were
near
the
window
which
looked
on
to
the
it
was
a
queer
shabby
little
bedroom
to
shelter
the
august
body
of
a
european
personage
like
prince
eugen
of
posen
curiously
enough
both
nella
and
her
father
ardent
democrats
though
they
were
had
been
somehow
impressed
by
the
royalty
and
importance
of
the
prince
impressed
as
they
had
never
been
by
aribert
they
had
both
felt
that
here
under
their
care
was
a
species
of
individuality
quite
new
to
them
and
different
from
anything
they
had
previously
encountered
even
the
gestures
and
tones
of
his
delirium
had
an
air
of
abrupt
yet
condescending
command
an
imposing
mixture
of
suavity
and
haughtiness
as
for
nella
she
had
been
first
struck
by
the
beautiful
e
over
a
crown
on
the
sleeves
of
his
linen
and
by
the
signet
ring
on
his
pale
emaciated
hand
after
all
these
trifling
outward
signs
are
at
least
as
effective
as
others
of
deeper
but
less
obtrusive
significance
the
racksoles
too
duly
marked
the
attitude
of
prince
aribert
to
his
nephew
it
was
at
once
paternal
and
reverential
it
disclosed
clearly
that
prince
aribert
continued
in
spite
of
everything
to
regard
his
nephew
as
his
sovereign
lord
and
master
as
a
being
surrounded
by
a
natural
and
inevitable
pomp
and
awe
this
attitude
at
the
beginning
seemed
false
and
unreal
to
the
americans
it
seemed
to
them
to
be
assumed
but
gradually
they
came
to
perceive
that
they
were
mistaken
and
that
though
america
might
have
cast
out
the
monarchial
superstition
nevertheless
that
superstition
had
vigorously
survived
in
another
part
of
the
world
you
and
mr
racksole
have
been
extraordinarily
kind
to
me
said
prince
aribert
very
quietly
after
the
two
had
sat
some
time
in
silence
why
how
she
asked
unaffectedly
we
are
interested
in
this
affair
ourselves
you
know
it
began
at
our
hotel
you
mustn
t
forget
that
i
don
t
he
said
i
forget
nothing
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
i
have
led
you
into
a
strange
entanglement
why
should
you
and
mr
racksole
be
here
you
who
are
supposed
to
be
on
a
holiday
hiding
in
a
strange
house
in
a
foreign
country
subject
to
all
sorts
of
annoyances
and
all
sorts
of
risks
simply
because
i
am
anxious
to
avoid
scandal
to
avoid
any
sort
of
talk
in
connection
with
my
misguided
nephew
it
is
nothing
to
you
that
the
hereditary
prince
of
posen
should
be
liable
to
a
public
disgrace
what
will
it
matter
to
you
if
the
throne
of
posen
becomes
the
of
europe
i
really
don
t
know
prince
nella
smiled
roguishly
but
we
americans
have
a
habit
of
going
right
through
with
anything
we
have
ah
he
said
who
knows
how
this
thing
will
end
all
our
trouble
our
anxieties
our
watchfulness
may
come
to
nothing
i
tell
you
that
when
i
see
eugen
lying
there
and
think
that
we
can
not
learn
his
story
until
he
recovers
i
am
ready
to
go
mad
we
might
be
arranging
things
making
matters
smooth
preparing
for
the
future
if
only
we
knew
knew
what
he
can
tell
us
i
tell
you
that
i
am
ready
to
go
mad
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
miss
racksole
i
would
kill
but
why
she
questioned
supposing
that
is
that
anything
could
happen
to
me
which
it
can
because
i
have
dragged
you
into
this
he
replied
gazing
at
her
it
is
nothing
to
you
you
are
only
being
how
do
you
know
it
is
nothing
to
me
prince
she
asked
him
quickly
just
then
the
sick
man
made
a
convulsive
movement
and
nella
flew
to
the
bed
and
soothed
him
from
the
head
of
the
bed
she
looked
over
at
prince
aribert
and
he
returned
her
bright
excited
glance
she
was
in
her
with
a
large
white
belgian
apron
tied
over
it
large
dark
circles
of
fatigue
and
sleeplessness
surrounded
her
eyes
and
to
the
prince
her
cheek
seemed
hollow
and
thin
her
hair
lay
thick
over
the
temples
half
covering
the
ears
aribert
gave
no
answer
to
her
query
merely
gazed
at
her
with
melancholy
intensity
i
think
i
will
go
and
rest
she
said
at
last
you
will
know
all
about
the
sleep
well
he
said
as
he
softly
opened
the
door
for
her
and
then
he
was
alone
with
eugen
it
was
his
turn
that
night
to
watch
for
they
still
some
strange
sudden
visit
or
onslaught
or
move
of
one
kind
or
another
from
jules
racksole
slept
in
the
parlour
on
the
ground
floor
nella
had
the
front
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
miss
spencer
was
immured
in
the
attic
the
lady
had
been
singularly
quiet
and
incurious
taking
her
food
from
nella
and
asking
no
questions
the
old
woman
went
at
nights
to
her
own
abode
in
the
purlieus
of
the
harbour
hour
after
hour
aribert
sat
silent
by
his
nephew
s
attending
mechanically
to
his
wants
and
every
now
and
then
gazing
hard
into
the
vacant
anguished
face
as
if
trying
to
extort
from
that
mask
the
secrets
which
it
held
aribert
was
tortured
by
the
idea
that
if
he
could
have
only
half
an
hour
s
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
rational
speech
with
prince
eugen
all
might
be
cleared
up
and
put
right
and
by
the
fact
that
that
rational
talk
was
absolutely
impossible
on
eugen
s
part
until
the
fever
had
run
its
course
as
the
minutes
crept
on
to
midnight
the
watcher
made
nervous
by
the
intense
electrical
atmosphere
which
seems
always
to
surround
a
person
who
is
dangerously
ill
grew
more
and
more
a
prey
to
vague
and
terrible
apprehensions
his
mind
dwelt
hysterically
on
the
most
fatal
possibilities
he
wondered
what
would
occur
if
by
any
eugen
should
die
in
that
bed
how
he
would
explain
the
affair
to
posen
and
to
the
emperor
how
he
would
justify
himself
he
saw
himself
being
tried
for
murder
sentenced
him
a
prince
of
the
blood
led
to
the
scaffold
a
scene
unparalleled
in
europe
for
over
a
century
then
he
gazed
anew
at
the
sick
man
and
thought
he
saw
death
in
every
drawn
feature
of
that
agonized
face
he
could
have
screamed
aloud
his
ears
heard
a
peculiar
resonant
boom
he
started
it
was
nothing
but
the
city
clock
striking
twelve
but
there
was
another
sound
a
mysterious
shuffle
at
the
door
he
listened
then
jumped
from
his
chair
nothing
now
nothing
but
still
he
felt
drawn
to
the
door
and
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
interval
he
went
and
opened
it
his
heart
beating
furiously
nella
lay
in
a
heap
on
the
door
mat
she
was
fully
dressed
but
had
apparently
lost
consciousness
he
clutched
at
her
slender
body
picked
her
up
carried
her
to
the
chair
by
the
and
laid
her
in
it
he
had
forgotten
all
about
eugen
what
is
it
my
angel
he
whispered
and
then
he
kissed
her
kissed
her
twice
he
could
only
look
at
her
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
to
succour
her
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
and
sighed
where
am
i
she
asked
vaguely
in
a
tremulous
tone
as
she
recognized
him
is
it
you
did
i
do
anything
silly
did
i
faint
what
has
happened
were
you
ill
he
questioned
anxiously
he
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
holding
her
hand
tight
i
saw
jules
by
the
side
of
my
bed
she
murmured
i
m
sure
i
saw
him
he
laughed
at
me
i
had
not
undressed
i
sprang
up
frightened
but
he
had
gone
and
then
i
ran
downstairs
to
you

dreaming
he
soothed
her
was
i
you
must
have
been
i
have
not
heard
a
sound
no
one
could
have
entered
but
if
you
like
i
will
wake
mr
perhaps
i
was
dreaming
she
admitted
how
foolish
you
were
he
said
still
unconsciously
holding
her
hand
they
gazed
at
each
other
she
smiled
at
him
you
kissed
me
she
said
suddenly
and
he
blushed
red
and
stood
up
before
her
why
did
you
kiss
me
ah
miss
racksole
he
murmured
hurrying
the
words
out
forgive
me
it
is
unforgivable
but
forgive
me
i
was
overpowered
by
my
feelings
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
why
did
you
kiss
me
she
repeated
because
nella
i
love
you
i
have
no
right
to
say
why
have
you
no
right
to
say
it
if
eugen
dies
i
shall
owe
a
duty
to
posen
i
shall
be
its
well
she
said
calmly
with
an
adorable
confidence
papa
is
worth
forty
millions
would
you
not
abdicate
ah
he
gave
a
low
cry
will
you
force
me
to
say
these
things
i
could
not
shirk
my
duty
to
posen
and
the
reigning
prince
of
posen
can
only
marry
a
but
prince
eugen
will
live
she
said
positively
and
if
he
lives
then
i
shall
be
free
i
would
renounce
all
my
rights
to
make
you
mine
if
if
if
what
prince
if
you
would
deign
to
accept
my
am
i
then
rich
enough
nella
he
bent
down
to
her
then
there
was
a
crash
of
breaking
glass
aribert
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
in
the
starlit
gloom
he
could
see
that
a
ladder
had
been
raised
against
the
back
of
the
house
he
thought
he
heard
footsteps
at
the
end
of
the
garden
it
was
jules
he
exclaimed
to
nella
and
without
another
word
rushed
upstairs
to
the
attic
the
attic
was
empty

mysteriously
vanished

royalty
at
the
grand
babylon
the
royal
apartments
at
the
grand
babylon
are
famous
in
the
world
of
hotels
and
indeed
elsewhere
as
being
in
their
own
way
unsurpassed
some
of
the
palaces
of
germany
and
in
particular
those
of
the
mad
ludwig
of
bavaria
may
possess
rooms
and
saloons
which
outshine
them
in
gorgeous
luxury
and
the
mere
wild
extravagance
of
wealth
but
there
is
nothing
anywhere
even
on
eighth
avenue
new
york
which
can
fairly
be
called
more
complete
more
perfect
more
enticing
or
not
least
important
more
comfortable
the
suite
consists
of
six
chambers
the
the
saloon
or
audience
chamber
the
the
yellow
where
royalty
receives
its
friends
the
library
and
the
state
bedroom
to
the
last
of
which
we
have
already
been
introduced
the
most
important
and
most
impressive
of
these
is
of
course
the
audience
chamber
an
apartment
fifty
feet
long
by
forty
feet
broad
with
a
superb
outlook
over
the
thames
the
shot
tower
and
the
higher
signals
of
the
western
railway
the
decoration
of
this
room
is
mainly
in
the
german
taste
since
four
out
of
every
six
of
its
royal
occupants
are
of
teutonic
blood
but
its
chief
glory
is
its
french
ceiling
a
masterpiece
by
fragonard
taken
bodily
from
a
certain
famous
palace
on
the
loire
the
walls
are
of
panelled
oak
with
an
dado
of
arras
cloth
imitated
from
unique
continental
examples
the
carpet
woven
in
one
piece
is
an
antique
specimen
of
the
finest
turkish
work
and
it
was
obtained
a
bargain
by
felix
babylon
from
an
impecunious
roumanian
prince
the
silver
candelabra
now
fitted
with
electric
light
came
from
the
rhine
and
each
had
a
separate
history
the
royal
chair
it
is
not
etiquette
to
call
it
a
throne
though
it
amounts
to
a
throne
was
looted
by
napoleon
from
an
austrian
city
and
bought
by
felix
babylon
at
the
sale
of
a
french
collector
at
each
corner
of
the
room
stands
a
gigantic
grotesque
vase
of
german
faïence
of
the
sixteenth
century
these
were
presented
to
felix
babylon
by
william
the
first
of
germany
upon
the
conclusion
of
his
first
incognito
visit
to
london
in
connection
with
the
french
trouble
of
there
is
only
one
picture
in
the
audience
chamber
it
is
a
portrait
of
the
luckless
but
noble
dom
pedro
emperor
of
the
brazils
given
to
felix
babylon
by
dom
pedro
himself
it
hangs
there
solitary
and
sublime
as
a
reminder
to
kings
and
princes
that
empires
may
pass
away
and
greatness
fall
a
certain
prince
who
was
occupying
the
suite
during
the
jubilee
of
when
the
grand
babylon
had
seven
persons
of
royal
blood
under
its
roof
sent
a
curt
message
to
felix
that
the
portrait
must
be
removed
felix
respectfully
declined
to
remove
it
and
the
prince
left
for
another
hotel
where
he
was
robbed
of
two
thousand
pounds
worth
of
jewellery
the
royal
audience
chamber
of
the
grand
babylon
if
people
only
knew
it
is
one
of
the
sights
of
london
but
it
is
never
shown
and
if
you
ask
the
hotel
servants
about
its
wonders
they
will
tell
you
only
foolish
facts
concerning
it
as
that
the
turkey
carpet
costs
fifty
pounds
to
clean
and
that
one
of
the
great
vases
is
cracked
across
the
pedestal
owing
to
the
rough
treatment
accorded
to
it
during
a
riotous
game
of
blind
man
s
buff
played
one
night
by
four
young
princesses
a
balkan
king
and
his
in
one
of
the
window
recesses
of
this
magnificent
apartment
on
a
certain
afternoon
in
late
july
stood
prince
aribert
of
posen
he
was
faultlessly
dressed
in
the
conventional
of
english
civilization
with
a
gardenia
in
his
and
the
indispensable
crease
down
the
front
of
the
trousers
he
seemed
to
be
fairly
amused
and
also
to
expect
someone
for
at
frequent
intervals
he
looked
rapidly
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
door
behind
the
royal
chair
at
last
a
little
wizened
stooping
old
man
with
a
distinctly
german
cast
of
countenance
appeared
through
the
door
and
laid
some
papers
on
a
small
table
by
the
side
of
the
chair
ah
hans
my
old
friend
said
aribert
approaching
the
old
man
i
must
have
a
little
talk
with
you
about
one
or
two
matters
how
do
you
find
his
royal
highness
the
old
man
saluted
military
fashion
not
very
well
your
highness
he
answered
i
ve
been
valet
to
your
highness
s
nephew
since
his
majority
and
i
was
valet
to
his
royal
father
before
him
but
i
never
saw
he
stopped
and
threw
up
his
wrinkled
hands
deprecatingly
you
never
saw
what
aribert
smiled
affectionately
on
the
old
fellow
you
could
perceive
that
these
two
so
sharply
differentiated
in
rank
had
been
intimate
in
the
past
and
would
be
intimate
again
do
you
know
my
prince
said
the
old
man
that
we
are
to
receive
the
financier
sampson
levi
is
that
his
name
in
the
audience
chamber
surely
if
i
may
humbly
suggest
the
library
would
have
been
good
enough
for
a
financier
one
would
have
thought
so
agreed
prince
aribert
but
perhaps
your
master
has
a
special
reason
tell
me
he
went
on
changing
the
subject
quickly
how
came
it
that
you
left
the
prince
my
nephew
at
ostend
and
returned
to
posen
his
orders
prince
and
old
hans
who
had
had
a
wide
experience
of
royal
whims
and
knew
half
the
secrets
of
the
courts
of
europe
gave
aribert
a
look
which
might
have
meant
anything
he
sent
me
back
on
an
an
errand
your
and
you
were
to
rejoin
him
here
just
so
highness
and
i
did
rejoin
him
here
although
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
begun
to
fear
that
i
might
never
see
my
master
the
prince
has
been
very
ill
in
ostend
so
i
have
gathered
hans
responded
drily
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
his
highness
is
not
yet
perfectly
not
yet
we
despaired
of
his
life
hans
at
one
time
but
thanks
to
an
excellent
constitution
he
came
safely
through
the
we
must
take
care
of
him
your
yes
indeed
said
aribert
solemnly
his
life
is
very
precious
to
at
that
moment
eugen
hereditary
prince
of
posen
entered
the
audience
chamber
he
was
pale
and
languid
and
his
uniform
seemed
to
be
a
trouble
to
him
his
hair
had
been
slightly
ruffled
and
there
was
a
look
of
uneasiness
almost
of
alarmed
unrest
in
his
fine
dark
eyes
he
was
like
a
man
who
is
afraid
to
look
behind
him
lest
he
should
see
something
there
which
ought
not
to
be
there
but
at
the
same
time
here
beyond
doubt
was
royalty
nothing
could
have
been
more
striking
than
the
contrast
between
eugen
a
sick
man
in
the
shabby
house
at
ostend
and
this
prince
eugen
in
the
royal
apartments
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
surrounded
by
the
luxury
and
pomp
which
modern
civilization
can
offer
to
those
born
in
high
places
all
the
desperate
episode
of
ostend
was
now
hidden
passed
over
it
was
supposed
never
to
have
occurred
it
existed
only
like
a
secret
shame
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
had
witnessed
it
prince
eugen
had
recovered
at
any
rate
he
was
convalescent
and
he
had
been
removed
to
london
where
he
took
up
again
the
dropped
thread
of
his
princely
life
the
lady
with
the
red
hat
the
incorruptible
and
savage
miss
spencer
the
unscrupulous
and
brilliant
jules
the
dark
damp
cellar
the
horrible
little
bedroom
these
things
were
over
thanks
to
prince
aribert
and
the
racksoles
he
had
emerged
from
them
in
safety
he
was
able
to
resume
his
public
and
official
career
the
emperor
had
been
informed
of
his
safe
arrival
in
london
after
an
unavoidable
delay
in
ostend
his
name
once
more
figured
in
the
court
chronicle
of
the
newspapers
in
short
everything
was
smothered
over
only
only
jules
rocco
and
miss
spencer
were
still
at
large
and
the
body
of
reginald
dimmock
lay
buried
in
the
domestic
mausoleum
of
the
palace
at
posen
and
prince
eugen
had
still
to
interview
mr
sampson
levi
that
various
matters
lay
heavy
on
the
mind
of
prince
eugen
was
beyond
question
he
seemed
to
have
withdrawn
within
himself
despite
the
extraordinary
experiences
through
which
he
had
recently
passed
events
which
called
aloud
for
explanations
and
confidence
between
the
nephew
and
the
uncle
he
would
say
scarcely
a
word
to
prince
aribert
any
allusion
however
direct
to
the
days
at
ostend
was
ignored
by
him
with
more
or
less
ingenuity
and
prince
aribert
was
really
no
nearer
a
full
solution
of
the
mystery
of
jules
plot
than
he
had
been
on
the
night
when
he
and
racksole
visited
the
gaming
tables
at
ostend
eugen
was
well
aware
that
he
had
been
kidnapped
through
the
agency
of
the
woman
in
the
red
hat
but
doubtless
ashamed
at
having
been
her
dupe
he
would
not
proceed
in
any
way
with
the
of
the
matter
you
will
receive
in
this
room
eugen
aribert
questioned
him
yes
was
the
answer
given
pettishly
why
not
even
if
i
have
no
proper
retinue
here
surely
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
hold
audience
in
a
proper
manner
hans
you
can
the
old
valet
promptly
disappeared
aribert
the
hereditary
prince
continued
when
they
were
alone
in
the
chamber
you
think
i
am
my
dear
eugen
said
prince
aribert
startled
in
spite
of
himself
don
t
be
i
say
you
think
i
am
mad
you
think
that
that
attack
of
brain
fever
has
left
its
permanent
mark
on
me
well
perhaps
i
am
mad
who
can
tell
god
knows
that
i
have
been
through
enough
lately
to
drive
me
aribert
made
no
reply
as
a
matter
of
strict
fact
the
thought
had
crossed
his
mind
that
eugen
s
brain
had
not
yet
recovered
its
normal
tone
and
activity
this
speech
of
his
nephew
s
however
had
the
effect
of
immediately
restoring
his
belief
in
the
latter
s
entire
sanity
he
felt
convinced
that
if
only
he
could
regain
his
nephew
s
confidence
the
old
brotherly
confidence
which
had
existed
between
them
since
the
years
when
they
played
together
as
boys
all
might
yet
be
well
but
at
present
there
appeared
to
be
no
sign
that
eugen
meant
to
give
his
confidence
to
anyone
the
young
prince
had
come
up
out
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
but
some
of
the
valley
s
shadow
had
clung
to
him
and
it
seemed
he
was
unable
to
dissipate
it
by
the
way
said
eugen
suddenly
i
must
reward
these
racksoles
i
suppose
i
am
indeed
grateful
to
them
if
i
gave
the
girl
a
bracelet
and
the
father
a
thousand
guineas
how
would
that
meet
the
case
my
dear
eugen
exclaimed
aribert
aghast
a
thousand
guineas
do
you
know
that
theodore
racksole
could
buy
up
all
posen
from
end
to
end
without
making
himself
a
pauper
a
thousand
guineas
you
might
as
well
offer
him
then
what
must
i
offer
nothing
except
your
thanks
anything
else
would
be
an
insult
these
are
no
ordinary
hotel
can
t
i
give
the
little
girl
a
bracelet
prince
eugen
gave
a
sinister
laugh
aribert
looked
at
him
steadily
no
he
said
why
did
you
kiss
her
that
night
asked
prince
eugen
carelessly
kiss
whom
said
aribert
blushing
and
angry
despite
his
most
determined
efforts
to
keep
calm
and
unconcerned
the
racksole
when
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
prince
eugen
that
night
in
ostend
when
i
was
you
thought
i
was
in
a
delirium
perhaps
i
was
but
somehow
i
remember
that
with
extraordinary
distinctness
i
remember
raising
my
head
for
a
fraction
of
an
instant
and
just
in
that
fraction
of
an
instant
you
kissed
her
oh
uncle
aribert
listen
eugen
for
god
s
sake
i
love
nella
racksole
i
shall
marry
you
there
was
a
long
pause
and
then
eugen
laughed
ah
he
said
they
all
talk
like
that
to
start
with
i
have
talked
like
that
myself
dear
uncle
it
sounds
nice
and
it
means
in
this
case
it
means
everything
eugen
said
aribert
quietly
some
accent
of
determination
in
the
latter
s
tone
made
eugen
rather
more
serious
you
can
t
marry
her
he
said
the
emperor
won
t
permit
a
morganatic
the
emperor
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
i
shall
renounce
my
rights
i
shall
become
a
plain
in
which
case
you
will
have
no
fortune
to
speak
but
my
wife
will
have
a
fortune
knowing
the
sacrifices
which
i
shall
have
made
in
order
to
marry
her
she
will
not
hesitate
to
place
that
fortune
in
my
hands
for
our
mutual
use
said
aribert
stiffly
you
will
decidedly
be
rich
mused
eugen
as
his
ideas
dwelt
on
theodore
racksole
s
reputed
wealth
but
have
you
thought
of
this
he
asked
and
his
mild
eyes
glowed
again
in
a
sort
of
madness
have
you
thought
that
i
am
unmarried
and
might
die
at
any
moment
and
then
the
throne
will
descend
to
you
to
you
aribert
the
throne
will
never
descend
to
me
eugen
said
aribert
softly
for
you
will
live
you
are
thoroughly
convalescent
you
have
nothing
to
it
is
the
next
seven
days
that
i
fear
said
eugen
the
next
seven
days
why
i
do
not
know
but
i
fear
them
if
i
can
survive
them
mr
sampson
levi
sire
hans
announced
in
a
loud
tone
chapter
twenty
mr
sampson
levi
bids
prince
eugen
good
morning
prince
eugen
started
i
will
see
him
he
said
with
a
gesture
to
hans
as
if
to
indicate
that
mr
sampson
levi
might
enter
at
once
i
beg
one
moment
first
said
aribert
laying
a
hand
gently
on
his
nephew
s
arm
and
giving
old
hans
a
glance
which
had
the
effect
of
precipitating
that
admirably
trained
servant
through
the
doorway
what
is
it
asked
prince
eugen
crossly
why
this
sudden
seriousness
don
t
forget
that
i
have
an
appointment
with
mr
sampson
levi
and
must
not
keep
him
waiting
someone
said
that
punctuality
is
the
politeness
of
eugen
said
aribert
i
wish
you
to
be
as
serious
as
i
am
why
can
not
we
have
faith
in
each
other
i
want
to
help
you
i
have
helped
you
you
are
my
titular
sovereign
but
on
the
other
hand
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
uncle
i
have
the
honour
to
be
the
same
age
as
you
and
to
have
been
your
companion
from
youth
up
give
me
your
confidence
i
thought
you
had
given
it
me
years
ago
but
i
have
lately
discovered
that
you
had
your
secrets
even
then
and
now
since
your
illness
you
are
still
more
what
do
you
mean
aribert
said
eugen
in
a
tone
which
might
have
been
either
inimical
or
friendly
what
do
you
want
to
say
well
in
the
first
place
i
want
to
say
that
you
will
not
succeed
with
the
estimable
mr
sampson
shall
i
not
said
eugen
lightly
how
do
you
know
what
my
business
is
with
him
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
know
you
will
never
get
that
million
pounds
out
of
prince
eugen
gasped
and
then
swallowed
his
excitement
who
has
been
talking
what
million
his
eyes
wandered
uneasily
round
the
room
ah
he
said
pretending
to
laugh
i
see
how
it
is
i
have
been
chattering
in
my
delirium
you
mustn
t
take
any
notice
of
that
aribert
when
one
has
a
fever
one
s
ideas
become
grotesque
and
you
never
talked
in
your
delirium
aribert
replied
at
least
not
about
yourself
i
knew
about
this
projected
loan
before
i
saw
you
in
who
told
you
demanded
eugen
fiercely
then
you
admit
that
you
are
trying
to
raise
a
loan
i
admit
nothing
who
told
you
theodore
racksole
the
millionaire
these
rich
men
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
they
form
a
coterie
closer
than
any
coterie
of
ours
eugen
and
far
more
powerful
they
talk
and
in
talking
they
rule
the
world
these
millionaires
they
are
the
real
curse
them
said
eugen
yes
perhaps
so
but
let
me
return
to
your
case
imagine
my
shame
my
disgust
when
i
found
that
racksole
could
tell
me
more
about
your
affairs
than
i
knew
myself
happily
he
is
a
good
fellow
one
can
trust
him
otherwise
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
do
something
desperate
when
i
discovered
that
all
your
private
history
was
in
his
hands
eugen
let
us
come
to
the
point
why
do
you
want
that
million
is
it
actually
true
that
you
are
so
deeply
in
debt
i
have
no
desire
to
improve
the
occasion
i
merely
and
what
if
i
do
owe
a
million
said
prince
eugen
with
assumed
valour
oh
nothing
my
dear
eugen
nothing
only
it
is
rather
a
large
sum
to
have
scattered
in
ten
years
is
it
not
how
did
you
manage
it
don
t
ask
me
aribert
i
ve
been
a
fool
but
i
swear
to
you
that
the
woman
whom
you
call
the
lady
in
the
red
hat
is
the
last
of
my
follies
i
am
about
to
take
a
wife
and
become
a
respectable
then
the
engagement
with
princess
anna
is
an
accomplished
fact
practically
so
as
soon
as
i
have
settled
with
levi
all
will
be
smooth
aribert
i
wouldn
t
lose
anna
for
the
imperial
throne
she
is
a
good
and
pure
woman
and
i
love
her
as
a
man
might
love
an
and
yet
you
would
deceive
her
as
to
your
debts
eugen
not
her
but
her
absurd
parents
and
perhaps
the
emperor
they
have
heard
rumours
and
i
must
set
those
rumours
at
rest
by
presenting
to
them
a
clean
i
am
glad
you
have
been
frank
with
me
eugen
said
prince
aribert
but
i
will
be
plain
with
you
you
will
never
marry
the
princess
and
why
said
eugen
supercilious
again
because
her
parents
will
not
permit
it
because
you
will
not
be
able
to
present
a
clean
sheet
to
them
because
this
sampson
levi
will
never
lend
you
a
explain
i
propose
to
do
so
you
were
kidnapped
it
is
a
horrid
word
but
we
must
use
it
in
do
you
know
why
i
suppose
because
that
vile
old
woman
and
her
accomplices
wanted
to
get
some
money
out
of
me
fortunately
thanks
to
you
they
didn
not
at
all
said
aribert
they
wanted
no
money
from
you
they
knew
well
enough
that
you
had
no
money
they
knew
you
were
the
naughty
schoolboy
among
european
princes
with
no
sense
of
responsibility
or
of
duty
towards
your
kingdom
shall
i
tell
you
why
they
kidnapped
you
when
you
have
done
abusing
me
my
dear
they
kidnapped
you
merely
to
keep
you
out
of
england
for
a
few
days
merely
to
compel
you
to
fail
in
your
appointment
with
sampson
levi
and
it
appears
to
me
that
they
succeeded
assuming
that
you
don
t
obtain
the
money
from
levi
is
there
another
financier
in
all
europe
from
whom
you
can
get
it
on
such
strange
security
as
you
have
to
offer
possibly
there
is
not
said
prince
eugen
calmly
but
you
see
i
shall
get
it
from
sampson
levi
levi
promised
it
and
i
know
from
other
sources
that
he
is
a
man
of
his
word
he
said
that
the
money
subject
to
certain
formalities
would
be
available
till
till
till
the
end
of
and
it
is
now
the
end
of
well
what
is
a
month
he
is
only
too
glad
to
lend
the
money
he
will
get
excellent
interest
how
on
earth
have
you
got
into
your
sage
old
head
this
notion
of
a
plot
against
me
the
idea
is
ridiculous
a
plot
against
me
what
for
have
you
ever
thought
of
bosnia
asked
aribert
coldly
what
of
bosnia
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
king
of
bosnia
is
naturally
under
obligations
to
austria
to
whom
he
owes
his
crown
austria
is
anxious
for
him
to
make
a
good
influential
well
let
he
is
going
to
he
is
going
to
marry
the
princess
not
while
i
live
he
made
overtures
there
a
year
ago
and
was
yes
but
he
will
make
overtures
again
and
this
time
he
will
not
be
rebuffed
oh
eugen
can
t
you
see
that
this
plot
against
you
is
being
engineered
by
some
persons
who
know
all
about
your
affairs
and
whose
desire
is
to
prevent
your
marriage
with
princess
anna
only
one
man
in
europe
can
have
any
motive
for
wishing
to
prevent
your
marriage
with
princess
anna
and
that
is
the
man
who
means
to
marry
her
eugen
went
very
pale
then
aribert
do
you
mean
to
convey
to
me
that
my
detention
in
ostend
was
contrived
by
the
agents
of
the
king
of
bosnia
i
with
a
view
to
stopping
my
negotiations
with
sampson
levi
and
so
putting
an
end
to
the
possibility
of
my
marriage
with
anna
aribert
nodded
you
are
a
good
friend
to
me
aribert
you
mean
well
but
you
are
mistaken
you
have
been
worrying
about
have
you
forgotten
about
reginald
dimmock
i
remember
you
said
that
he
had
i
said
nothing
of
the
sort
i
said
that
he
had
been
assassinated
that
was
part
of
it
my
poor
pooh
said
eugen
i
don
t
believe
he
was
assassinated
and
as
for
sampson
levi
i
will
bet
you
a
thousand
marks
that
he
and
i
come
to
terms
this
morning
and
that
the
million
is
in
my
hands
before
i
leave
aribert
shook
his
head
you
seem
to
be
pretty
sure
of
mr
levi
s
character
have
you
had
much
to
do
with
him
before
well
eugen
hesitated
a
second
a
little
what
young
man
in
my
position
hasn
t
had
something
to
do
with
mr
sampson
levi
at
one
time
or
another
i
haven
t
said
aribert
you
you
are
a
he
rang
a
silver
bell
hans
i
will
receive
mr
sampson
whereupon
aribert
discreetly
departed
and
prince
eugen
sat
down
in
the
great
velvet
chair
and
began
to
look
at
the
papers
which
hans
had
previously
placed
upon
the
table
good
morning
your
royal
highness
said
sampson
levi
bowing
as
he
entered
i
trust
your
royal
highness
is
moderately
thanks
returned
the
prince
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
had
as
much
to
do
with
people
of
royal
blood
as
any
plain
man
in
europe
sampson
levi
had
never
yet
learned
how
to
be
at
ease
with
these
exalted
individuals
during
the
first
few
minutes
of
an
interview
afterwards
he
resumed
command
of
himself
and
his
faculties
but
at
the
beginning
he
was
invariably
flustered
scarlet
of
face
and
inclined
to
perspiration
we
will
proceed
to
business
at
once
said
prince
eugen
will
you
take
a
seat
mr
levi
i
thank
your
royal
now
as
to
that
loan
which
we
had
already
practically
arranged
a
million
i
think
it
was
said
the
prince
airily
a
million
levi
acquiesced
toying
with
his
enormous
watch
chain
everything
is
now
in
order
here
are
the
papers
and
i
should
like
to
finish
the
matter
up
at
exactly
your
highness
but
but
what
you
months
ago
expressed
the
warmest
satisfaction
at
the
security
though
i
am
quite
prepared
to
admit
that
the
security
is
of
rather
an
unusual
nature
you
also
agreed
to
the
rate
of
interest
it
is
not
everyone
mr
levi
who
can
lend
out
a
million
at
per
cent
and
in
ten
years
the
whole
amount
will
be
paid
back
i
er
i
believe
i
informed
you
that
the
fortune
of
princess
anna
who
is
about
to
accept
my
hand
will
ultimately
amount
to
something
like
fifty
millions
of
marks
which
is
over
two
million
pounds
in
your
english
prince
eugen
stopped
he
had
no
fancy
for
talking
in
this
confidential
manner
to
financiers
but
he
felt
that
circumstances
demanded
it
you
see
it
s
like
this
your
royal
highness
began
mr
sampson
levi
in
his
homely
english
idiom
it
s
like
this
i
said
i
could
keep
that
bit
of
money
available
till
the
end
of
june
and
you
were
to
give
me
an
interview
here
before
that
date
not
having
heard
from
your
highness
and
not
knowing
your
highness
s
address
though
my
german
agents
made
every
inquiry
i
concluded
that
you
had
made
other
arrangements
money
being
so
cheap
this
last
few
i
was
unfortunately
detained
at
ostend
said
prince
eugen
with
as
much
haughtiness
as
he
could
assume
by
by
important
business
i
have
made
no
other
arrangements
and
i
shall
have
need
of
the
million
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
pay
it
to
my
london
bankers
i
m
very
sorry
said
mr
sampson
levi
with
a
tremendous
and
dazzling
air
of
politeness
which
surprised
even
himself
but
my
syndicate
has
now
lent
the
money
elsewhere
it
s
in
south
america
i
don
t
mind
telling
your
highness
that
we
ve
lent
it
to
the
chilean
hang
the
chilean
government
mr
levi
exclaimed
the
prince
and
he
went
white
i
must
have
that
million
it
was
an
it
was
an
arrangement
i
admit
said
mr
sampson
levi
but
your
highness
broke
the
there
was
a
long
silence
do
you
mean
to
say
began
the
prince
with
tense
calmness
that
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
let
me
have
that
million
i
could
let
your
highness
have
a
million
in
a
couple
of
years
the
prince
made
a
gesture
of
annoyance
mr
levi
he
said
if
you
do
not
place
the
money
in
my
hands
you
will
ruin
one
of
the
oldest
of
reigning
families
and
incidentally
you
will
alter
the
map
of
europe
you
are
not
keeping
faith
and
i
had
relied
on
pardon
me
your
highness
said
little
levi
rising
in
resentment
it
is
not
i
who
have
not
kept
faith
i
beg
to
repeat
that
the
money
is
no
longer
at
my
disposal
and
to
bid
your
highness
good
and
mr
sampson
levi
left
the
audience
chamber
with
an
awkward
aggrieved
bow
it
was
a
scene
characteristic
of
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
overfed
commonplace
pursy
little
man
who
had
been
born
in
a
brixton
villa
and
whose
highest
idea
of
pleasure
was
a
sunday
up
the
river
in
an
expensive
electric
launch
confronting
and
utterly
routing
in
a
hotel
belonging
to
an
american
millionaire
the
representative
of
a
race
of
men
who
had
fingered
every
page
of
european
history
for
centuries
and
who
still
in
their
native
castles
were
surrounded
with
every
outward
circumstance
of
pomp
and
power
aribert
said
prince
eugen
a
little
later
you
were
right
it
is
all
over
i
have
only
one
refuge
you
don
t
mean
aribert
stopped
dumbfounded
yes
i
do
he
said
quickly
i
can
manage
it
so
that
it
will
look
like
an
chapter
the
return
of
félix
babylon
on
the
evening
of
prince
eugen
s
fateful
interview
with
mr
sampson
levi
theodore
racksole
was
wandering
somewhat
aimlessly
and
uneasily
about
the
entrance
hall
and
adjacent
corridors
of
the
grand
babylon
he
had
returned
from
ostend
only
a
day
or
two
previously
and
had
endeavoured
with
all
his
might
to
forget
the
affair
which
had
carried
him
there
to
regard
it
in
fact
as
done
with
but
he
found
himself
unable
to
do
so
in
vain
he
remarked
under
his
breath
that
there
were
some
things
which
were
best
left
alone
if
his
experience
as
a
manipulator
of
markets
a
contriver
of
gigantic
schemes
in
new
york
had
taught
him
anything
at
all
it
should
surely
have
taught
him
that
yet
he
could
not
feel
reconciled
to
such
a
position
the
mere
presence
of
the
princes
in
his
hotel
roused
the
fighting
instincts
of
this
man
who
had
never
in
his
whole
career
been
beaten
he
had
as
it
were
taken
up
arms
on
their
side
and
if
the
princes
of
posen
would
not
continue
their
own
battle
nevertheless
he
theodore
racksole
wanted
to
continue
it
for
them
to
a
certain
extent
of
course
the
battle
had
been
won
for
prince
eugen
had
been
rescued
from
an
extremely
difficult
and
dangerous
position
and
the
enemy
consisting
of
jules
rocco
miss
spencer
and
perhaps
others
had
been
put
to
flight
but
that
he
conceived
was
not
enough
it
was
very
far
from
being
enough
that
the
criminals
for
criminals
they
decidedly
were
should
still
be
at
large
he
regarded
as
an
absurd
anomaly
and
there
was
another
point
he
had
said
nothing
to
the
police
of
all
that
had
occurred
he
disdained
the
police
but
he
could
scarcely
fail
to
perceive
that
if
the
police
should
by
accident
gain
a
clue
to
the
real
state
of
the
case
he
might
be
placed
rather
awkwardly
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
it
amounted
to
a
misdemeanour
to
conceal
as
much
as
he
had
concealed
he
asked
himself
for
the
thousandth
time
why
he
had
adopted
a
policy
of
concealment
from
the
police
why
he
had
become
in
any
way
interested
in
the
posen
matter
and
why
at
this
present
moment
he
should
be
so
anxious
to
prosecute
it
further
to
the
first
two
questions
he
replied
rather
lamely
that
he
had
been
influenced
by
nella
and
also
by
a
natural
spirit
of
adventure
to
the
third
he
replied
that
he
had
always
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
things
through
and
was
now
actuated
by
a
mere
childish
obstinate
desire
to
carry
this
one
through
moreover
he
was
splendidly
conscious
of
his
perfect
ability
to
carry
it
through
one
additional
impulse
he
had
though
he
did
not
admit
it
to
himself
being
by
nature
adverse
to
big
words
and
that
was
an
abstract
love
of
justice
the
s
instinct
for
helping
the
right
side
to
conquer
even
when
grave
risks
must
thereby
be
run
with
no
corresponding
advantage
he
was
turning
these
things
over
in
his
mind
as
he
walked
about
the
vast
hotel
on
that
evening
of
the
last
day
in
july
the
society
papers
had
been
stating
for
a
week
past
that
london
was
empty
but
in
spite
of
the
society
papers
london
persisted
in
seeming
to
be
just
as
full
as
ever
the
grand
babylon
was
certainly
not
as
crowded
as
it
had
been
a
month
earlier
but
it
was
doing
a
very
passable
business
at
the
close
of
the
season
the
gay
butterflies
of
the
social
community
have
a
habit
of
hovering
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
big
hotels
before
they
flutter
away
to
castle
and
meadow
and
moor
lake
and
stream
the
great
in
the
portico
were
well
filled
by
old
and
gentlemen
engaged
in
enjoying
the
varied
delights
of
liqueurs
cigars
and
the
full
moon
which
floated
so
serenely
above
the
thames
here
and
there
a
pretty
woman
on
the
arm
of
a
cavalier
in
immaculate
attire
swept
her
train
as
she
turned
to
and
fro
in
the
promenade
of
the
terrace
waiters
and
uniformed
commissionaires
and
doorkeepers
moved
noiselessly
about
at
short
intervals
the
chief
of
the
doorkeepers
blew
his
shrill
whistle
and
hansoms
drove
up
with
tinkling
bell
to
take
away
a
pair
of
butterflies
to
some
place
of
amusement
or
boredom
occasionally
a
private
carriage
drawn
by
expensive
and
horses
put
the
hansoms
to
shame
by
its
mere
outward
glory
it
was
a
hot
night
a
night
for
the
summer
woods
and
save
for
the
vehicles
there
was
no
rapid
movement
of
any
kind
it
seemed
as
though
the
world
the
world
that
is
to
say
of
the
grand
babylon
was
fully
engaged
in
the
solemn
processes
of
digestion
and
even
the
long
row
of
the
embankment
stretching
right
and
left
scarcely
trembled
in
the
still
warm
caressing
air
the
stars
overhead
looked
down
with
many
blinkings
upon
the
enormous
pile
of
the
grand
babylon
and
the
moon
regarded
it
with
bland
and
changeless
face
what
they
thought
of
it
and
its
inhabitants
can
not
unfortunately
be
recorded
what
theodore
racksole
thought
of
the
moon
can
be
recorded
he
thought
it
was
a
nuisance
it
somehow
fascinated
his
gaze
with
its
silly
stare
and
so
interfered
with
his
complex
meditations
he
glanced
round
at
the
dressed
and
satisfied
people
his
guests
his
customers
they
appeared
to
ignore
him
absolutely
probably
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
them
had
the
least
idea
that
this
tall
spare
man
with
the
hair
and
the
thin
firm
resolute
face
who
wore
his
evening
clothes
with
such
careless
ease
was
the
sole
proprietor
of
the
grand
babylon
and
possibly
the
richest
man
in
europe
as
has
already
been
stated
racksole
was
not
a
celebrity
in
england
the
guests
of
the
grand
babylon
saw
merely
a
restless
male
person
whose
restlessness
was
rather
a
disturber
of
their
quietude
but
with
whom
to
judge
by
his
countenance
it
would
be
inadvisable
to
remonstrate
therefore
theodore
racksole
continued
his
perambulations
unchallenged
and
kept
saying
to
himself
i
must
do
but
what
he
could
think
of
no
course
to
pursue
at
last
he
walked
straight
through
the
hotel
and
out
at
the
other
entrance
and
so
up
the
little
unassuming
side
street
into
the
roaring
torrent
of
the
narrow
and
crowded
strand
he
jumped
on
a
putney
bus
and
paid
his
fair
to
putney
fivepence
and
then
finding
that
the
humble
occupants
of
the
vehicle
stared
at
the
spectacle
of
a
man
in
evening
dress
but
without
a
dustcoat
he
jumped
off
again
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
the
conductor
jerked
a
thumb
towards
him
and
winked
at
the
passengers
as
who
should
say
there
goes
a
he
went
into
a
tobacconist
s
shop
and
asked
for
a
cigar
the
shopman
mildly
inquired
what
price
what
are
the
best
you
ve
got
asked
theodore
racksole
five
shillings
each
sir
said
the
man
promptly
give
me
a
penny
one
was
theodore
racksole
s
laconic
request
and
he
walked
out
of
the
shop
smoking
the
penny
cigar
it
was
a
new
sensation
for
him
he
was
inhaling
the
aromatic
odours
of
eugène
rimmel
s
establishment
for
the
sale
of
scents
when
a
gentleman
walking
slowly
in
the
opposite
direction
accosted
him
with
a
quiet
good
evening
mr
the
millionaire
did
not
at
first
recognize
his
interlocutor
who
wore
a
travelling
overcoat
and
was
carrying
a
handbag
then
a
slight
pleased
smile
passed
over
his
features
and
he
held
out
his
hand
well
mr
babylon
he
greeted
the
other
of
all
persons
in
the
wide
world
you
are
the
man
i
would
most
have
wished
to
you
flatter
me
said
the
little
anglicized
swiss
no
i
don
t
answered
racksole
it
isn
t
my
custom
any
more
than
it
s
yours
i
wanted
to
have
a
real
good
long
yarn
with
you
and
lo
here
you
are
where
have
you
sprung
from
from
lausanne
said
felix
babylon
i
had
finished
my
duties
there
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
i
felt
homesick
i
felt
the
nostalgia
of
london
and
so
i
came
over
just
as
you
see
and
he
raised
the
handbag
for
racksole
s
notice
one
toothbrush
one
razor
two
slippers
eh
he
laughed
i
was
wondering
as
i
walked
along
where
i
should
stay
me
felix
babylon
homeless
in
i
should
advise
you
to
stay
at
the
grand
babylon
racksole
laughed
back
it
is
a
good
hotel
and
i
know
the
proprietor
rather
expensive
is
it
not
said
babylon
to
you
sir
answered
racksole
the
inclusive
terms
will
be
exactly
half
a
crown
a
week
do
you
accept
i
accept
said
babylon
and
added
you
are
very
good
mr
they
strolled
together
back
to
the
hotel
saying
nothing
in
particular
but
feeling
very
content
with
each
other
s
company
many
customers
asked
felix
babylon
very
tolerable
said
racksole
assuming
as
much
of
the
air
of
the
professional
hotel
proprietor
as
he
could
i
think
i
may
say
in
the
storekeeper
s
phrase
that
if
there
is
any
business
about
i
am
doing
it
the
people
are
all
on
the
terrace
in
the
portico
it
s
so
confoundedly
hot
and
the
consumption
of
ice
is
simply
enormous
nearly
as
large
as
it
would
be
in
new
in
that
case
said
babylon
politely
let
me
offer
you
another
but
i
have
not
finished
this
that
is
just
why
i
wish
to
offer
you
another
one
a
cigar
such
as
yours
my
good
friend
ought
never
to
be
smoked
within
the
precincts
of
the
grand
babylon
not
even
by
the
proprietor
of
the
grand
babylon
and
especially
when
all
the
guests
are
assembled
in
the
portico
the
fumes
of
it
would
ruin
any
theodore
racksole
laughingly
lighted
the
rothschild
havana
which
babylon
gave
him
and
they
entered
the
hotel
arm
in
arm
but
no
sooner
had
they
mounted
the
steps
than
little
felix
became
the
object
of
numberless
greetings
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
highly
popular
among
his
quondam
guests
at
last
they
reached
the
managerial
room
where
babylon
was
regaled
on
a
chicken
and
racksole
assisted
him
in
the
consumption
of
a
bottle
of
heidsieck
monopole
carte
d
or
this
chicken
is
almost
perfectly
grilled
said
babylon
at
length
it
is
a
credit
to
the
house
but
why
my
dear
racksole
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
did
you
quarrel
with
rocco
then
you
have
heard
heard
my
dear
friend
it
was
in
every
newspaper
on
the
continent
some
journals
prophesied
that
the
grand
babylon
would
have
to
close
its
doors
within
half
a
year
now
that
rocco
had
deserted
it
but
of
course
i
knew
better
i
knew
that
you
must
have
a
good
reason
for
allowing
rocco
to
depart
and
that
you
must
have
made
arrangements
in
advance
for
a
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
not
made
arrangements
in
advance
said
theodore
racksole
a
little
ruefully
but
happily
we
have
found
in
our
second
an
artist
inferior
only
to
rocco
himself
that
however
was
mere
good
surely
said
babylon
it
was
indiscreet
to
trust
to
mere
good
fortune
in
such
a
serious
matter
i
didn
t
trust
to
mere
good
fortune
i
didn
t
trust
to
anything
except
rocco
and
he
deceived
but
why
did
you
quarrel
with
him
i
didn
t
quarrel
with
him
i
found
him
embalming
a
corpse
in
the
state
bedroom
one
night
you
what
babylon
almost
screamed
i
found
him
embalming
a
corpse
in
the
state
bedroom
repeated
racksole
in
his
quietest
tones
the
two
men
gazed
at
each
other
and
then
racksole
replenished
babylon
s
glass
tell
me
said
babylon
settling
himself
deep
in
an
easy
chair
and
lighting
a
cigar
and
racksole
thereupon
recounted
to
him
the
whole
of
the
posen
episode
with
every
circumstantial
detail
so
far
as
he
knew
it
it
was
a
long
and
complicated
recital
and
occupied
about
an
hour
during
that
time
little
felix
never
spoke
a
word
scarcely
moved
a
muscle
only
his
small
eyes
gazed
through
the
bluish
haze
of
smoke
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
tinkled
midnight
time
for
whisky
and
soda
said
racksole
and
got
up
as
if
to
ring
the
bell
but
babylon
waved
him
back
you
have
told
me
that
this
sampson
levi
had
an
audience
of
prince
eugen
but
you
have
not
told
me
the
result
of
that
audience
said
babylon
because
i
do
not
yet
know
it
but
i
shall
doubtless
know
in
the
meantime
i
feel
fairly
sure
that
levi
declined
to
produce
prince
eugen
s
required
million
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
money
was
lent
h
m
mused
babylon
and
then
carelessly
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
at
that
arrangement
for
spying
through
the
bathroom
of
the
state
why
are
you
not
surprised
oh
said
babylon
it
is
such
an
obvious
dodge
so
easy
to
carry
out
as
for
me
i
took
special
care
never
to
involve
myself
in
these
affairs
i
knew
they
existed
i
somehow
felt
that
they
existed
but
i
also
felt
that
they
lay
outside
my
sphere
my
business
was
to
provide
board
and
lodging
of
the
most
sumptuous
kind
to
those
who
didn
t
mind
paying
for
it
and
i
did
my
business
if
anything
else
went
on
in
the
hotel
under
the
rose
i
long
determined
to
ignore
it
unless
it
should
happen
to
be
brought
before
my
notice
and
it
never
was
brought
before
my
notice
however
i
admit
that
there
is
a
certain
pleasurable
excitement
in
this
kind
of
affair
and
doubtless
you
have
experienced
i
have
said
racksole
simply
though
i
believe
you
are
laughing
at
by
no
means
babylon
replied
now
what
if
i
may
ask
the
question
is
going
to
be
your
next
step
that
is
just
what
i
desire
to
know
myself
said
theodore
racksole
well
said
babylon
after
a
pause
let
us
begin
in
the
first
place
it
is
possible
you
may
be
interested
to
hear
that
i
happened
to
see
jules
you
did
racksole
remarked
with
much
calmness
where
well
it
was
early
this
morning
in
paris
just
before
i
left
there
the
meeting
was
quite
accidental
and
jules
seemed
rather
surprised
at
meeting
me
he
respectfully
inquired
where
i
was
going
and
i
said
that
i
was
going
to
switzerland
at
that
moment
i
thought
i
was
going
to
switzerland
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
after
all
i
should
be
happier
there
and
that
i
had
better
turn
back
and
not
see
london
any
more
however
i
changed
my
mind
once
again
and
decided
to
come
on
to
london
and
accept
the
risks
of
being
miserable
there
without
my
hotel
then
i
asked
jules
whither
he
was
bound
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
off
to
constantinople
being
interested
in
a
new
french
hotel
there
i
wished
him
good
luck
and
we
constantinople
eh
said
racksole
a
highly
suitable
place
for
him
i
should
but
babylon
resumed
i
caught
sight
of
him
where
at
charing
cross
a
few
minutes
before
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
mr
jules
had
not
gone
to
constantinople
after
all
he
did
not
see
me
or
i
should
have
suggested
to
him
that
in
going
from
paris
to
constantinople
it
is
not
usual
to
travel
via
the
cheek
of
the
fellow
exclaimed
theodore
racksole
the
gorgeous
and
colossal
cheek
of
the
fellow
chapter
in
the
wine
cellars
of
the
grand
babylon
do
you
know
anything
of
the
antecedents
of
this
jules
asked
theodore
racksole
helping
himself
to
whisky
nothing
whatever
said
babylon
until
you
told
me
i
don
t
think
i
was
aware
that
his
true
name
was
thomas
jackson
though
of
course
i
knew
that
it
was
not
jules
i
certainly
was
not
aware
that
miss
spencer
was
his
wife
but
i
had
long
suspected
that
their
relations
were
somewhat
more
intimate
than
the
nature
of
their
respective
duties
in
the
hotel
absolutely
demanded
all
that
i
do
know
of
jules
he
will
always
be
called
jules
is
that
he
gradually
by
some
mysterious
personal
force
acquired
a
prominent
position
in
the
hotel
decidedly
he
was
the
cleverest
and
most
intellectual
waiter
i
have
ever
known
and
he
was
specially
skilled
in
the
difficult
task
of
retaining
his
own
dignity
while
not
interfering
with
that
of
other
people
i
m
afraid
this
information
is
a
little
too
vague
to
be
of
any
practical
assistance
in
the
present
what
is
the
present
difficulty
racksole
queried
with
a
simple
air
i
should
imagine
that
the
present
difficulty
is
to
account
for
the
man
s
presence
in
that
is
easily
accounted
for
said
racksole
how
do
you
suppose
he
is
anxious
to
give
himself
up
to
justice
or
that
the
chains
of
habit
bind
him
to
the
hotel
neither
said
racksole
jules
is
going
to
have
another
try
that
s
another
try
at
what
at
prince
eugen
either
at
his
life
or
his
liberty
most
probably
the
former
this
time
almost
certainly
the
former
he
has
guessed
that
we
are
somewhat
handicapped
by
our
anxiety
to
keep
prince
eugen
s
predicament
quite
quiet
and
he
is
taking
advantage
of
that
fact
as
he
already
is
fairly
rich
on
his
own
admission
the
reward
which
has
been
offered
to
him
must
be
enormous
and
he
is
absolutely
determined
to
get
it
he
has
several
times
recently
proved
himself
to
be
a
daring
fellow
unless
i
am
mistaken
he
will
shortly
prove
himself
to
be
still
more
but
what
can
he
do
surely
you
don
t
suggest
that
he
will
attempt
the
life
of
prince
eugen
in
this
hotel
why
not
if
reginald
dimmock
fell
on
mere
suspicion
that
he
would
turn
out
unfaithful
to
the
conspiracy
why
not
prince
eugen
but
it
would
be
an
unspeakable
crime
and
do
infinite
harm
to
the
hotel
true
racksole
admitted
smiling
little
felix
babylon
seemed
to
brace
himself
for
the
grasping
of
his
monstrous
idea
how
could
it
possibly
be
done
he
asked
at
length
dimmock
was
yes
but
you
had
rocco
here
then
and
rocco
was
in
the
plot
it
is
conceivable
that
rocco
could
have
managed
it
barely
conceivable
but
without
rocco
i
can
not
think
it
possible
i
can
not
even
think
that
jules
would
attempt
it
you
see
in
a
place
like
the
grand
babylon
as
probably
i
needn
t
point
out
to
you
food
has
to
pass
through
so
many
hands
that
to
poison
one
person
without
killing
perhaps
fifty
would
be
a
most
delicate
operation
moreover
prince
eugen
unless
he
has
changed
his
habits
is
always
served
by
his
own
attendant
old
hans
and
therefore
any
attempt
to
tamper
with
a
cooked
dish
immediately
before
serving
would
be
hazardous
in
the
granted
said
racksole
the
wine
however
might
be
more
easily
got
at
had
you
thought
of
that
i
had
not
babylon
admitted
you
are
an
ingenious
theorist
but
i
happen
to
know
that
prince
eugen
always
has
his
wine
opened
in
his
own
presence
no
doubt
it
would
be
opened
by
hans
therefore
the
wine
theory
is
not
tenable
my
i
do
not
see
why
said
racksole
i
know
nothing
of
wine
as
an
expert
and
i
very
seldom
drink
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
bottle
of
wine
might
be
tampered
with
while
it
was
still
in
the
cellar
especially
if
there
was
an
accomplice
in
the
you
think
then
that
you
are
not
yet
rid
of
all
your
conspirators
i
think
that
jules
might
still
have
an
accomplice
within
the
and
that
a
bottle
of
wine
could
be
opened
and
recorked
without
leaving
any
trace
of
the
operation
babylon
was
a
trifle
sarcastic
i
don
t
see
the
necessity
of
opening
the
bottle
in
order
to
poison
the
wine
said
racksole
i
have
never
tried
to
poison
anybody
by
means
of
a
bottle
of
wine
and
i
don
t
lay
claim
to
any
natural
talent
as
a
poisoner
but
i
think
i
could
devise
several
ways
of
managing
the
trick
of
course
i
admit
i
may
be
entirely
mistaken
as
to
jules
ah
said
felix
babylon
the
wine
cellars
beneath
us
are
one
of
the
wonders
of
london
i
hope
you
are
aware
mr
racksole
that
when
you
bought
the
grand
babylon
you
bought
what
is
probably
the
finest
stock
of
wines
in
england
if
not
in
europe
in
the
valuation
i
reckoned
them
at
sixty
thousand
pounds
and
i
may
say
that
i
always
took
care
that
the
cellars
were
properly
guarded
even
jules
would
experience
a
serious
difficulty
in
breaking
into
the
cellars
without
the
connivance
of
the
and
the
is
or
was
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
have
not
yet
inspected
my
wines
smiled
racksole
i
have
never
given
them
a
thought
once
or
twice
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
make
a
tour
of
the
hotel
but
i
omitted
the
cellars
in
my
impossible
my
dear
fellow
said
babylon
amused
at
such
a
confession
to
him
a
great
connoisseur
and
lover
of
fine
wines
almost
incredible
but
really
you
must
see
them
if
i
may
i
will
accompany
why
not
racksole
suggested
calmly
it
is
very
late
hubbard
will
have
gone
to
and
may
i
ask
who
is
hubbard
i
remember
the
name
but
hubbard
is
the
of
the
grand
babylon
said
felix
with
a
certain
emphasis
a
sedate
man
of
forty
he
has
the
keys
of
the
cellars
he
knows
every
bottle
of
every
bin
its
date
its
qualities
its
value
and
he
s
a
teetotaler
hubbard
is
a
curiosity
no
wine
can
leave
the
cellars
without
his
knowledge
and
no
person
can
enter
the
cellars
without
his
knowledge
at
least
that
is
how
it
was
in
my
time
babylon
added
we
will
wake
him
said
racksole
but
it
is
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
babylon
protested
never
mind
that
is
if
you
consent
to
accompany
me
a
cellar
is
the
same
by
night
as
by
day
therefore
why
not
now
babylon
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
you
wish
he
agreed
with
his
indestructible
politeness
and
now
to
find
this
mr
hubbard
with
his
key
of
the
cupboard
said
racksole
as
they
walked
out
of
the
room
together
although
the
hour
was
so
late
the
hotel
was
not
of
course
closed
for
the
night
a
few
guests
still
remained
about
in
the
public
rooms
and
a
few
fatigued
waiters
were
still
in
attendance
one
of
these
latter
was
despatched
in
search
of
the
singular
mr
hubbard
and
it
fortunately
turned
out
that
this
gentleman
had
not
actually
retired
though
he
was
on
the
point
of
doing
so
he
brought
the
keys
to
mr
racksole
in
person
and
after
he
had
had
a
little
chat
with
his
former
master
the
proprietor
and
the
proprietor
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
proceeded
on
their
way
to
the
cellars
these
cellars
extend
over
or
rather
under
quite
half
the
superficial
areas
of
the
whole
hotel
the
longitudinal
half
which
lies
next
to
the
strand
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
ground
slopes
sharply
from
the
strand
to
the
river
the
grand
babylon
is
so
to
speak
deeper
near
the
strand
than
it
is
near
the
thames
towards
the
thames
there
is
below
the
entrance
level
a
basement
and
a
towards
the
strand
there
is
basement
and
the
huge
wine
cellars
beneath
all
after
descending
the
four
flights
of
the
service
stairs
and
traversing
a
long
passage
running
parallel
with
the
kitchen
the
two
found
themselves
opposite
a
door
which
on
being
unlocked
gave
access
to
another
flight
of
stairs
at
the
foot
of
this
was
the
main
entrance
to
the
cellars
outside
the
entrance
was
the
for
the
ascension
of
delicious
fluids
to
the
upper
floors
and
opposite
mr
hubbard
s
little
office
there
was
electric
light
everywhere
babylon
who
as
being
most
accustomed
to
them
held
the
bunch
of
keys
opened
the
great
door
and
then
they
were
in
the
first
cellar
the
first
of
a
suite
of
five
racksole
was
struck
not
only
by
the
icy
coolness
of
the
place
but
also
by
its
vastness
babylon
had
seized
a
portable
electric
handlight
attached
to
a
long
wire
which
lay
handy
and
waving
it
about
disclosed
the
dimensions
of
the
place
by
that
flashing
illumination
the
subterranean
chamber
looked
unutterably
weird
and
mysterious
with
its
rows
of
numbered
bins
stretching
away
into
the
distance
till
the
radiance
was
reduced
to
the
occasional
far
gleam
of
the
light
on
the
shoulder
of
a
bottle
then
babylon
switched
on
the
fixed
electric
lights
and
theodore
racksole
entered
upon
a
conducted
tour
of
what
was
quite
the
most
interesting
part
of
his
own
property
to
see
the
innocent
enthusiasm
of
felix
babylon
for
these
stores
of
exhilarating
liquid
was
what
is
called
in
the
north
a
sight
for
sair
een
he
displayed
to
racksole
s
bewildered
gaze
in
their
due
order
all
the
wines
of
three
continents
nay
of
four
for
the
superb
and
luscious
constantia
wine
of
cape
colony
was
not
wanting
in
that
most
catholic
collection
of
vintages
beginning
with
the
unsurpassed
products
of
burgundy
he
continued
with
the
clarets
of
médoc
bordeaux
and
sauterne
then
to
the
champagnes
of
ay
hautvilliers
and
pierry
then
to
the
hocks
and
moselles
of
germany
and
the
brilliant
imitation
champagnes
of
main
neckar
and
naumburg
then
to
the
famous
and
adorable
tokay
of
hungary
and
all
the
austrian
varieties
of
french
wines
including
carlowitz
and
somlauer
then
to
the
dry
sherries
of
spain
including
purest
manzanilla
and
amontillado
and
vino
de
pasto
then
to
the
wines
of
malaga
both
sweet
and
dry
and
all
the
spanish
reds
from
catalonia
including
the
dark
tent
so
often
used
sacramentally
then
to
the
renowned
port
of
oporto
then
he
proceeded
to
the
italian
cellar
and
descanted
upon
the
excellence
of
barolo
from
piedmont
of
chianti
from
tuscany
of
orvieto
from
the
roman
states
of
the
tears
of
christ
from
naples
and
the
commoner
marsala
from
sicily
and
so
on
to
an
extent
and
with
a
fullness
of
detail
which
can
not
be
rendered
here
at
the
end
of
the
suite
of
cellars
there
was
a
glazed
door
which
as
could
be
seen
gave
access
to
a
supplemental
and
smaller
cellar
an
apartment
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
square
anything
special
in
there
asked
racksole
curiously
as
they
stood
before
the
door
and
looked
within
at
the
seined
ends
of
bottles
ah
exclaimed
babylon
almost
smacking
his
lips
therein
lies
the
cream
of
the
best
champagne
i
suppose
said
racksole
yes
said
babylon
the
best
champagne
is
there
a
very
special
sillery
as
exquisite
as
you
will
find
anywhere
but
i
see
my
friend
that
you
fall
into
the
common
error
of
putting
champagne
first
among
wines
that
distinction
belongs
to
burgundy
you
have
old
burgundy
in
that
cellar
mr
racksole
which
cost
me
how
much
do
you
think
eighty
pounds
a
bottle
probably
it
will
never
be
drunk
he
added
with
a
sigh
it
is
too
expensive
even
for
princes
and
yes
it
will
said
racksole
quickly
you
and
i
will
have
a
bottle
up
then
continued
babylon
still
riding
his
there
is
a
sample
of
the
rhine
wine
dated
which
caused
such
a
sensation
at
the
vienna
exhibition
of
there
is
also
a
singularly
glorious
persian
wine
from
shiraz
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
seen
elsewhere
also
there
is
an
unrivalled
vintage
of
greatest
of
all
modern
burgundies
if
i
remember
right
prince
eugen
invariably
has
a
bottle
when
he
comes
to
stay
here
it
is
not
on
the
hotel
wine
list
of
course
and
only
a
few
customers
know
of
it
we
do
not
precisely
hawk
it
about
the
indeed
said
racksole
let
us
go
they
entered
the
stone
apartment
rendered
almost
sacred
by
the
preciousness
of
its
contents
and
racksole
looked
round
with
a
strangely
intent
and
curious
air
at
the
far
side
was
a
grating
through
which
came
a
feeble
light
what
is
that
asked
the
millionaire
sharply
that
is
merely
a
ventilation
grating
good
ventilation
is
absolutely
looks
broken
doesn
t
it
racksole
suggested
and
then
putting
a
finger
quickly
on
babylon
s
shoulder
there
s
someone
in
the
cellar
can
t
you
hear
breathing
down
there
behind
that
bin
the
two
men
stood
tense
and
silent
for
a
while
listening
under
the
ray
of
the
single
electric
light
in
the
ceiling
half
the
cellar
was
involved
in
gloom
at
length
racksole
walked
firmly
down
the
central
between
the
bins
and
turned
to
the
corner
at
the
right
come
out
you
villain
he
said
in
a
low
vicious
tone
and
dragged
up
a
cowering
figure
he
had
expected
to
find
a
man
but
it
was
his
own
daughter
nella
racksole
upon
whom
he
had
laid
angry
hands
chapter
further

in
the

well
father
nella
greeted
her
astounded
parent
you
should
make
sure
that
you
have
got
hold
of
the
right
person
before
you
use
all
that
terrible
muscular
force
of
yours
i
do
believe
you
have
broken
my
shoulder
she
rubbed
her
shoulder
with
a
comical
expression
of
pain
and
then
stood
up
before
the
two
men
the
skirt
of
her
dark
grey
dress
was
torn
and
dirty
and
the
usually
trim
nella
looked
as
though
she
had
been
shot
down
a
canvas
mechanically
she
smoothed
her
frock
and
gave
a
straightening
touch
to
her
hair
good
evening
miss
racksole
said
felix
babylon
bowing
formally
this
is
an
unexpected
felix
s
manners
never
deserted
him
upon
any
occasion
whatever
may
i
inquire
what
you
are
doing
in
my
wine
cellar
nella
racksole
said
the
millionaire
a
little
stiffly
he
was
certainly
somewhat
annoyed
at
having
mistaken
his
daughter
for
a
criminal
moreover
he
hated
to
be
surprised
and
upon
this
occasion
he
had
been
surprised
beyond
any
ordinary
surprise
lastly
he
was
not
at
all
pleased
that
nella
should
be
observed
in
that
strange
predicament
by
a
stranger
i
will
tell
you
said
nella
i
had
been
reading
rather
late
in
my
room
the
night
was
so
close
i
heard
big
ben
strike
twelve
and
then
i
put
the
book
down
and
went
out
on
to
the
balcony
of
my
window
for
a
little
fresh
air
before
going
to
bed
i
leaned
over
the
balcony
very
quietly
you
will
remember
that
i
am
on
the
third
floor
now
and
looked
down
below
into
the
little
sunk
yard
which
separates
the
wall
of
the
hotel
from
salisbury
lane
i
was
rather
astonished
to
see
a
figure
creeping
across
the
yard
i
knew
there
was
no
entrance
into
the
hotel
from
that
yard
and
besides
it
is
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
below
the
level
of
the
street
so
i
watched
the
figure
went
close
up
against
the
wall
and
disappeared
from
my
view
i
leaned
over
the
balcony
as
far
as
i
dared
but
i
couldn
t
see
him
i
could
hear
him
what
could
you
hear
questioned
racksole
sharply
it
sounded
like
a
sawing
noise
said
nella
and
it
went
on
for
quite
a
long
time
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
should
think
a
rasping
sort
of
why
on
earth
didn
t
you
come
and
warn
me
or
someone
else
in
the
hotel
asked
racksole
oh
i
don
t
know
dad
she
replied
sweetly
i
had
got
interested
in
it
and
i
thought
i
would
see
it
out
myself
well
as
i
was
saying
babylon
she
continued
addressing
her
remarks
to
felix
with
a
dazzling
smile
that
noise
went
on
for
quite
a
long
time
at
last
it
stopped
and
the
figure
reappeared
from
under
the
wall
crossed
the
yard
climbed
up
the
opposite
wall
by
some
means
or
other
and
so
over
the
railings
into
salisbury
lane
i
felt
rather
relieved
then
because
i
knew
he
hadn
t
actually
broken
into
the
hotel
he
walked
down
salisbury
lane
very
slowly
a
policeman
was
just
coming
up
goodnight
officer
i
heard
him
say
to
the
policeman
and
he
asked
him
for
a
match
the
policeman
supplied
the
match
and
the
other
man
lighted
a
cigarette
and
proceeded
further
down
the
lane
by
cricking
your
neck
from
my
window
mr
babylon
you
can
get
a
glimpse
of
the
embankment
and
the
river
i
saw
the
man
cross
the
embankment
and
lean
over
the
river
wall
where
he
seemed
to
be
talking
to
some
one
he
then
walked
along
the
embankment
to
westminster
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
i
waited
a
minute
or
two
for
him
to
come
back
but
he
didn
t
come
back
and
so
i
thought
it
was
about
time
i
began
to
make
inquiries
into
the
affair
i
went
downstairs
instantly
and
out
of
the
hotel
through
the
quadrangle
into
salisbury
lane
and
i
looked
over
those
railings
there
was
a
ladder
on
the
other
side
by
which
it
was
perfectly
easy
once
you
had
got
over
the
railings
to
climb
down
into
the
yard
i
was
horribly
afraid
lest
someone
might
walk
up
salisbury
lane
and
catch
me
in
the
act
of
negotiating
those
railings
but
no
one
did
and
i
surmounted
them
with
no
worse
damage
than
a
torn
skirt
i
crossed
the
yard
on
tiptoe
and
i
found
that
in
the
wall
close
to
the
ground
and
almost
exactly
under
my
window
there
was
an
iron
grating
about
one
foot
by
fourteen
inches
i
suspected
as
there
was
no
other
ironwork
near
that
the
mysterious
visitor
must
have
been
sawing
at
this
grating
for
private
purposes
of
his
own
i
gave
it
a
good
shake
and
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
that
a
good
part
of
it
came
off
in
my
hand
leaving
just
enough
room
for
a
person
to
creep
through
i
decided
that
i
would
creep
through
and
now
wish
i
hadn
t
i
don
t
know
mr
babylon
whether
you
have
ever
tried
to
creep
through
a
small
hole
with
a
skirt
on
have
you
i
have
not
had
that
pleasure
said
little
felix
bowing
again
and
absently
taking
up
a
bottle
which
lay
to
his
hand
well
you
are
fortunate
the
imperturbable
nella
resumed
for
quite
three
minutes
i
thought
i
should
perish
in
that
grating
dad
with
my
shoulder
inside
and
the
rest
of
me
outside
however
at
last
by
the
most
amazing
and
agonizing
efforts
i
pulled
myself
through
and
fell
into
this
extraordinary
cellar
more
dead
than
alive
then
i
wondered
what
i
should
do
next
should
i
wait
for
the
mysterious
visitor
to
return
and
stab
him
with
my
pocket
scissors
if
he
tried
to
enter
or
should
i
raise
an
alarm
first
of
all
i
replaced
the
broken
grating
then
i
struck
a
match
and
i
saw
that
i
had
got
landed
in
a
wilderness
of
bottles
the
match
went
out
and
i
hadn
t
another
one
so
i
sat
down
in
the
corner
to
think
i
had
just
decided
to
wait
and
see
if
the
visitor
returned
when
i
heard
footsteps
and
then
voices
and
then
you
came
in
i
must
say
i
was
rather
taken
aback
especially
as
i
recognized
the
voice
of
mr
babylon
you
see
i
didn
t
want
to
frighten
you
if
i
had
bobbed
up
from
behind
the
bottles
and
said
booh
you
would
have
had
a
serious
shock
i
wanted
to
think
of
a
way
of
breaking
my
presence
gently
to
you
but
you
saved
me
the
trouble
dad
was
i
really
breathing
so
loudly
that
you
could
hear
me
the
girl
ended
her
strange
recital
and
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
in
the
cellar
racksole
merely
nodded
an
affirmative
to
her
concluding
question
well
nell
my
girl
said
the
millionaire
at
length
we
are
much
obliged
for
your
gymnastic
efforts
very
much
obliged
but
now
i
think
you
had
better
go
off
to
bed
there
is
going
to
be
some
serious
trouble
here
i
ll
lay
my
last
dollar
on
that
but
if
there
is
to
be
a
burglary
i
should
so
like
to
see
it
dad
nella
pleaded
i
ve
never
seen
a
burglar
caught
this
isn
t
a
burglary
my
dear
i
calculate
it
s
something
far
worse
than
a
what
she
cried
murder
arson
dynamite
plot
how
perfectly
splendid
mr
babylon
informs
me
that
jules
is
in
london
said
racksole
quietly
jules
she
exclaimed
under
her
breath
and
her
tone
changed
instantly
to
the
utmost
seriousness
switch
off
the
light
quick
springing
to
the
switch
she
put
the
cellar
in
darkness
what
s
that
for
said
her
father
if
he
comes
back
he
would
see
the
light
and
be
frightened
away
said
nella
that
wouldn
t
do
at
it
wouldn
t
miss
racksole
said
babylon
and
there
was
in
his
voice
a
note
of
admiration
for
the
girl
s
sagacity
which
racksole
heard
with
high
paternal
pride
listen
nella
said
the
latter
drawing
his
daughter
to
him
in
the
profound
gloom
of
the
cellar
we
fancy
that
jules
may
be
trying
to
tamper
with
a
certain
bottle
of
wine
a
bottle
which
might
possibly
be
drunk
by
prince
eugen
now
do
you
think
that
the
man
you
saw
might
have
been
jules
i
hadn
t
previously
thought
of
him
as
being
jules
but
immediately
you
mentioned
the
name
i
somehow
knew
that
he
was
yes
i
am
sure
it
was
well
just
hear
what
i
have
to
say
there
is
no
time
to
lose
if
he
is
coming
at
all
he
will
be
here
very
soon
and
you
can
racksole
explained
what
he
thought
jules
tactics
might
be
he
proposed
that
if
the
man
returned
he
should
not
be
interfered
with
but
merely
watched
from
the
other
side
of
the
glass
door
you
want
as
it
were
to
catch
mr
jules
alive
said
babylon
who
seemed
rather
taken
aback
at
this
novel
method
of
dealing
with
criminals
surely
he
added
it
would
be
simpler
and
easier
to
inform
the
police
of
your
suspicion
and
to
leave
everything
to
my
dear
fellow
said
racksole
we
have
already
gone
much
too
far
without
the
police
to
make
it
advisable
for
us
to
call
them
in
at
this
somewhat
advanced
stage
of
the
proceedings
besides
if
you
must
know
it
i
have
a
particular
desire
to
capture
the
scoundrel
myself
i
will
leave
you
and
nella
here
since
nella
insists
on
seeing
everything
and
i
will
arrange
things
so
that
once
he
has
entered
the
cellar
jules
will
not
get
out
of
it
again
at
any
rate
through
the
grating
you
had
better
place
yourselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
door
in
the
big
cellar
you
will
be
in
a
position
to
observe
from
there
i
will
skip
off
at
once
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
take
note
of
what
the
fellow
does
if
he
has
any
accomplices
within
the
hotel
we
shall
probably
be
able
by
that
means
to
discover
who
the
accomplice
lighting
a
match
and
shading
it
with
his
hands
racksole
showed
them
both
out
of
the
little
cellar
now
if
you
lock
this
glass
door
on
the
outside
he
can
t
escape
this
way
the
panes
of
glass
are
too
small
and
the
woodwork
too
stout
so
if
he
comes
into
the
trap
you
two
will
have
the
pleasure
of
actually
seeing
him
frantically
writhe
therein
without
any
personal
danger
but
perhaps
you
d
better
not
show
in
another
moment
felix
babylon
and
nella
were
left
to
themselves
in
the
darkness
of
the
cellar
listening
to
the
receding
footfalls
of
theodore
racksole
but
the
sound
of
these
footfalls
had
not
died
away
before
another
sound
greeted
their
ears
the
grating
of
the
small
cellar
was
being
removed
i
hope
your
father
will
be
in
time
whispered
felix
hush
the
girl
warned
him
and
they
stooped
side
by
side
in
tense
silence
a
man
cautiously
but
very
neatly
wormed
his
body
through
the
aperture
of
the
grating
the
watchers
could
only
see
his
form
indistinctly
in
the
darkness
then
being
fairly
within
the
cellar
he
walked
without
the
least
hesitation
to
the
electric
switch
and
turned
on
the
light
it
was
unmistakably
jules
and
he
knew
the
geography
of
the
cellar
very
well
babylon
could
with
difficulty
repress
a
start
as
he
saw
this
bold
and
unscrupulous
moving
with
such
an
air
of
assurance
and
determination
about
the
precious
cellar
jules
went
directly
to
a
small
bin
which
was
numbered
and
took
there
from
the
topmost
bottle
the
prince
eugen
s
wine
babylon
exclaimed
under
his
breath
jules
neatly
and
quickly
removed
the
seal
with
an
instrument
which
he
had
clearly
brought
for
the
purpose
he
then
took
a
little
flat
box
from
his
pocket
which
seemed
to
contain
a
sort
of
black
salve
rubbing
his
finger
in
this
he
smeared
the
top
of
the
neck
of
the
bottle
with
it
just
where
the
cork
came
against
the
glass
in
another
instant
he
had
deftly
replaced
the
seal
and
restored
the
bottle
to
its
position
he
then
turned
off
the
light
and
made
for
the
aperture
when
he
was
way
through
nella
exclaimed
he
will
escape
after
all
dad
has
not
had
time
we
must
stop
but
babylon
that
embodiment
of
caution
forcibly
but
nevertheless
politely
restrained
this
yankee
girl
whom
he
deemed
so
rash
and
imprudent
and
before
she
could
free
herself
the
lithe
form
of
jules
had
disappeared
chapter
the
bottle
of
wine
as
regards
theodore
racksole
who
was
to
have
caught
his
man
from
the
outside
of
the
cellar
he
made
his
way
as
rapidly
as
possible
from
the
up
to
the
ground
floor
out
of
the
hotel
by
the
quadrangle
through
the
quadrangle
and
out
into
the
top
of
salisbury
lane
now
owing
to
the
vastness
of
the
structure
of
the
grand
babylon
the
mere
distance
thus
to
be
traversed
amounted
to
a
little
short
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
as
it
included
a
number
of
stairs
about
two
dozen
turnings
and
several
passages
which
at
that
time
of
night
were
in
darkness
more
or
less
complete
racksole
could
not
have
been
expected
to
accomplish
the
journey
in
less
than
five
minutes
as
a
matter
of
fact
six
minutes
had
elapsed
before
he
reached
the
top
of
salisbury
lane
because
he
had
been
delayed
nearly
a
minute
by
some
questions
addressed
to
him
by
a
muddled
and
guest
who
had
got
lost
in
the
corridors
as
everybody
knows
there
is
a
sharp
short
bend
in
salisbury
lane
near
the
top
racksole
ran
round
this
at
good
racing
speed
but
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
run
straight
up
against
the
very
policeman
who
had
not
long
before
so
courteously
supplied
jules
with
a
match
the
policeman
seemed
to
be
scarcely
in
so
pliant
a
mood
just
then
hullo
he
said
his
naturally
suspicious
nature
being
doubtless
aroused
by
the
spectacle
of
a
bareheaded
man
in
evening
dress
running
violently
down
the
lane
what
s
this
where
are
you
for
in
such
a
hurry
and
he
forcibly
detained
theodore
racksole
for
a
moment
and
scrutinized
his
face
now
officer
said
racksole
quietly
none
of
your
larks
if
you
please
i
ve
no
time
to
beg
your
pardon
sir
the
policeman
remarked
though
hesitatingly
and
not
quite
with
good
temper
and
racksole
was
allowed
to
proceed
on
his
way
the
millionaire
s
scheme
for
trapping
jules
was
to
get
down
into
the
little
sunk
yard
by
means
of
the
ladder
and
then
to
secrete
himself
behind
some
convenient
abutment
of
brickwork
until
mr
tom
jackson
should
have
got
into
the
cellar
he
therefore
nimbly
surmounted
the
railings
the
railings
of
his
own
hotel
and
was
gingerly
descending
the
ladder
when
lo
a
rough
hand
seized
him
by
the
and
with
a
ferocious
jerk
urged
him
backwards
the
fact
was
theodore
racksole
had
counted
without
the
policeman
that
guardian
of
the
peace
mistrusting
racksole
s
manner
quietly
followed
him
down
the
lane
the
sight
of
the
millionaire
climbing
the
railings
had
put
him
on
his
mettle
and
the
result
was
the
ignominious
capture
of
racksole
in
vain
theodore
expostulated
explained
anathematized
only
one
thing
would
satisfy
the
stolid
policeman
namely
that
racksole
should
return
with
him
to
the
hotel
and
there
establish
his
identity
if
racksole
then
proved
to
be
racksole
owner
of
the
grand
babylon
well
and
good
the
policeman
promised
to
apologize
so
theodore
had
no
alternative
but
to
accept
the
suggestion
to
prove
his
identity
was
of
course
the
work
of
only
a
few
minutes
after
which
racksole
annoyed
but
cool
as
ever
returned
to
his
railings
while
the
policeman
went
off
to
another
part
of
his
beat
where
he
would
be
likely
to
meet
a
comrade
and
have
a
chat
in
the
meantime
our
friend
jules
sublimely
unconscious
of
the
altercation
going
on
outside
and
of
the
special
risk
which
he
ran
was
of
course
actually
in
the
cellar
which
he
had
reached
before
racksole
got
to
the
railings
for
the
first
time
it
was
indeed
a
happy
chance
for
jules
that
his
exit
from
the
cellar
coincided
with
the
period
during
which
racksole
was
absent
from
the
railings
as
racksole
came
down
the
lane
for
the
second
time
he
saw
a
figure
walking
about
fifty
yards
in
front
of
him
towards
the
embankment
instantly
he
divined
that
it
was
jules
and
that
the
policeman
had
thrown
him
just
too
late
he
ran
and
jules
hearing
the
noise
of
pursuit
ran
also
the
was
fleet
he
made
direct
for
a
certain
spot
in
the
embankment
wall
and
to
the
intense
astonishment
of
racksole
jumped
clean
over
the
wall
as
it
seemed
into
the
river
is
he
so
desperate
as
to
commit
suicide
racksole
exclaimed
as
he
ran
but
a
second
later
the
puff
and
snort
of
a
steam
launch
told
him
that
jules
was
not
quite
driven
to
suicide
as
the
millionaire
crossed
the
embankment
roadway
he
saw
the
funnel
of
the
launch
move
out
from
under
the
it
swerved
into
midstream
and
headed
towards
london
bridge
there
was
a
silent
mist
over
the
river
racksole
was
helpless
although
racksole
had
now
been
twice
worsted
in
a
contest
of
wits
within
the
precincts
of
the
grand
babylon
once
by
rocco
and
once
by
jules
he
could
not
fairly
blame
himself
for
the
present
miscarriage
of
his
miscarriage
due
to
the
meddlesomeness
of
an
extraneous
person
combined
with
pure
he
did
not
therefore
permit
the
accident
to
interfere
with
his
sleep
that
night
on
the
following
day
he
sought
out
prince
aribert
between
whom
and
himself
there
now
existed
a
feeling
of
unmistakable
frank
friendship
and
disclosed
to
him
the
happenings
of
the
previous
night
and
particularly
the
tampering
with
the
bottle
of
i
believe
you
dined
with
prince
eugen
last
night
i
did
and
curiously
enough
we
had
a
bottle
of
an
admirable
wine
of
which
eugen
is
passionately
and
you
will
dine
with
him
most
probably
will
i
fear
be
our
last
day
here
eugen
wishes
to
return
to
posen
early
has
it
struck
you
prince
said
racksole
that
if
jules
had
succeeded
in
poisoning
your
nephew
he
would
probably
have
succeeded
also
in
poisoning
you
i
had
not
thought
of
it
laughed
aribert
but
it
would
seem
so
it
appears
that
so
long
as
he
brings
down
his
particular
quarry
jules
is
careless
of
anything
else
that
may
be
accidentally
involved
in
the
destruction
however
we
need
have
no
fear
on
that
score
now
you
know
the
bottle
and
you
can
destroy
it
at
but
i
do
not
propose
to
destroy
it
said
racksole
calmly
if
prince
eugen
asks
for
to
be
served
as
he
probably
will
i
propose
that
that
precise
bottle
shall
be
served
to
him
and
to
then
you
would
poison
us
in
spite
of
ourselves
scarcely
racksole
smiled
my
notion
is
to
discover
the
accomplices
within
the
hotel
i
have
already
inquired
as
to
the
hubbard
now
does
it
not
occur
to
you
as
extraordinary
that
on
this
particular
day
mr
hubbard
should
be
ill
in
bed
hubbard
i
am
informed
is
suffering
from
an
attack
of
stomach
poisoning
which
has
supervened
during
the
night
he
says
that
he
does
not
know
what
can
have
caused
it
his
place
in
the
wine
cellars
will
be
taken
by
his
assistant
a
mere
youth
but
to
all
appearances
a
fairly
smart
youth
i
need
not
say
that
we
shall
keep
an
eye
on
that
one
moment
prince
aribert
interrupted
i
do
not
quite
understand
how
you
think
the
poisoning
was
to
have
been
the
bottle
is
now
under
examination
by
an
expert
who
has
instructions
to
remove
as
little
as
possible
of
the
stuff
which
jules
put
on
the
rim
of
the
mouth
of
it
it
will
be
secretly
replaced
in
its
bin
during
the
day
my
idea
is
that
by
the
mere
action
of
pouring
out
the
wine
takes
up
some
of
the
poison
which
i
deem
to
be
very
strong
and
thus
becomes
fatal
as
it
enters
the
but
surely
the
servant
in
attendance
would
wipe
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
very
carelessly
perhaps
and
moreover
he
would
be
extremely
unlikely
to
wipe
off
all
the
stuff
some
of
it
has
been
ingeniously
placed
just
on
the
inside
edge
of
the
rim
besides
suppose
he
forgot
to
wipe
the
bottle
prince
eugen
is
always
served
at
dinner
by
hans
it
is
an
honour
which
the
faithful
old
fellow
reserves
for
but
suppose
hans
racksole
stopped
hans
an
accomplice
my
dear
racksole
the
suggestion
is
wildly
that
night
prince
aribert
dined
with
his
august
nephew
in
the
superb
of
the
royal
apartments
hans
served
the
dishes
being
brought
to
the
door
by
other
servants
aribert
found
his
nephew
despondent
and
taciturn
on
the
previous
day
when
after
the
futile
interview
with
sampson
levi
prince
eugen
had
despairingly
threatened
to
commit
suicide
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
look
like
an
accident
aribert
had
compelled
him
to
give
his
word
of
honour
not
to
do
so
what
wine
will
your
royal
highness
take
asked
old
hans
in
his
soothing
tones
when
the
soup
was
served
sherry
was
prince
eugen
s
curt
order
and
afterwards
said
hans
aribert
looked
up
quickly
no
not
i
ll
try
sillery
said
prince
eugen
i
think
i
ll
have
hans
after
all
he
said
it
suits
me
better
than
the
famous
and
unsurpassable
burgundy
was
served
with
the
roast
old
hans
brought
it
tenderly
in
its
wicker
cradle
inserted
the
corkscrew
with
mathematical
precision
and
drew
the
cork
which
he
offered
for
his
master
s
inspection
eugen
nodded
and
told
him
to
put
it
down
aribert
watched
with
intense
interest
he
could
not
for
an
instant
believe
that
hans
was
not
the
very
soul
of
fidelity
and
yet
despite
himself
racksole
s
words
had
caused
him
a
certain
uneasiness
at
that
moment
prince
eugen
murmured
across
the
table
aribert
i
withdraw
my
promise
observe
that
i
withdraw
aribert
shook
his
head
emphatically
without
removing
his
gaze
from
hans
the
servant
perfunctorily
dusted
his
napkin
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
of
and
poured
out
a
glass
aribert
trembled
from
head
to
foot
eugen
took
up
the
glass
and
held
it
to
the
light
don
t
drink
it
said
aribert
very
quietly
it
is
poisoned
exclaimed
prince
eugen
poisoned
sire
exclaimed
old
hans
with
an
air
of
profound
amazement
and
concern
and
he
seized
the
glass
impossible
sire
i
myself
opened
the
bottle
no
one
else
has
touched
it
and
the
cork
was
i
tell
you
it
is
poisoned
aribert
repeated
your
highness
will
pardon
an
old
man
said
hans
but
to
say
that
this
wine
is
poison
is
to
say
that
i
am
a
murderer
i
will
prove
to
you
that
it
is
not
poisoned
i
will
drink
and
he
raised
the
glass
to
his
trembling
lips
in
that
moment
aribert
saw
that
old
hans
at
any
rate
was
not
an
accomplice
of
jules
springing
up
from
his
seat
he
knocked
the
glass
from
the
aged
servitor
s
hands
and
the
fragments
of
it
fell
with
a
light
tinkling
crash
partly
on
the
table
and
partly
on
the
floor
the
prince
and
the
servant
gazed
at
one
another
in
a
distressing
and
terrible
silence
there
was
a
slight
noise
and
aribert
looked
aside
he
saw
that
eugen
s
body
had
slipped
forward
limply
over
the
left
arm
of
his
chair
the
prince
s
arms
hung
straight
and
lifeless
his
eyes
were
closed
he
was
unconscious
hans
murmured
aribert
hans
what
is
this
chapter
the
steam
launch
mr
tom
jackson
s
notion
of
making
good
his
escape
from
the
hotel
by
means
of
a
steam
launch
was
an
excellent
one
so
far
as
it
went
but
theodore
racksole
for
his
part
did
not
consider
that
it
went
quite
far
enough
theodore
racksole
opined
with
peculiar
glee
that
he
now
had
a
tangible
and
definite
clue
for
the
catching
of
the
grand
babylon
s
he
knew
nothing
of
the
port
of
london
but
he
happened
to
know
a
good
deal
of
the
far
more
complicated
though
somewhat
smaller
port
of
new
york
and
he
was
sure
there
ought
to
be
no
extraordinary
difficulty
in
getting
hold
of
jules
steam
launch
to
those
who
are
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
it
the
river
thames
and
its
docks
from
london
bridge
to
gravesend
seems
a
vast
and
uncharted
wilderness
of
craft
a
wilderness
in
which
it
would
be
perfectly
easy
to
hide
even
a
successfully
to
such
people
the
idea
of
looking
for
a
steam
launch
on
the
river
would
be
about
equivalent
to
the
idea
of
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
but
the
fact
is
there
are
hundreds
of
men
between
st
katherine
s
wharf
and
blackwall
who
literally
know
the
thames
as
the
suburban
householder
knows
his
who
can
recognize
thousands
of
ships
and
put
a
name
to
them
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
who
are
informed
as
to
every
movement
of
vessels
on
the
great
stream
who
know
all
the
captains
all
the
engineers
all
the
lightermen
all
the
pilots
all
the
licensed
watermen
and
all
the
unlicensed
scoundrels
from
the
tower
to
gravesend
and
a
lot
further
by
these
experts
of
the
thames
the
slightest
unusual
event
on
the
water
is
noticed
and
discussed
a
wherry
can
not
change
hands
but
they
will
guess
shrewdly
upon
the
price
paid
and
the
intentions
of
the
new
owner
with
regard
to
it
they
have
a
habit
of
watching
the
river
for
the
mere
interest
of
the
sight
and
they
talk
about
everything
like
housewives
gathered
of
an
evening
round
the
cottage
door
if
the
first
mate
of
a
castle
liner
gets
the
sack
they
will
be
able
to
tell
you
what
he
said
to
the
captain
what
the
old
man
said
to
him
and
what
both
said
to
the
board
and
having
finished
off
that
affair
they
will
cheerfully
turn
to
discussing
whether
bill
stevens
sank
his
barge
outside
the
west
indian
by
accident
or
on
purpose
theodore
racksole
had
no
satisfactory
means
of
identifying
the
steam
launch
which
carried
away
mr
tom
jackson
the
sky
had
clouded
over
soon
after
midnight
and
there
was
also
a
slight
mist
and
he
had
only
been
able
to
make
out
that
it
was
a
low
craft
about
sixty
feet
long
probably
painted
black
he
had
personally
kept
a
watch
all
through
the
night
on
vessels
going
upstream
and
during
the
next
morning
he
had
a
man
to
take
his
place
who
warned
him
whenever
a
steam
launch
went
towards
westminster
at
noon
after
his
conversation
with
prince
aribert
he
went
down
the
river
in
a
hired
as
far
as
the
custom
house
and
poked
about
everywhere
in
search
of
any
vessel
which
could
by
any
possibility
be
the
one
he
was
in
search
of
but
he
found
nothing
he
was
therefore
tolerably
sure
that
the
mysterious
launch
lay
somewhere
below
the
custom
house
at
the
custom
house
stairs
he
landed
and
asked
for
a
very
high
official
an
official
inferior
only
to
a
commissioner
whom
he
had
entertained
once
in
new
york
and
who
had
met
him
in
london
on
business
at
lloyd
s
in
the
large
but
dingy
office
of
this
great
man
a
long
conversation
took
place
a
conversation
in
which
racksole
had
to
exercise
a
certain
amount
of
persuasive
power
and
which
ultimately
ended
in
the
high
official
ringing
his
bell
desire
mr
hazell
room
no
to
speak
to
me
said
the
official
to
the
boy
who
answered
the
summons
and
then
turning
to
racksole
i
need
hardly
repeat
my
dear
mr
racksole
that
this
is
strictly
agreed
of
course
said
racksole
mr
hazell
entered
he
was
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
dressed
in
blue
serge
with
a
pale
keen
face
a
brown
moustache
and
a
rather
handsome
brown
beard
mr
hazell
said
the
high
official
let
me
introduce
you
to
mr
theodore
racksole
you
will
doubtless
be
familiar
with
his
name
mr
hazell
he
went
on
to
racksole
is
one
of
our
outdoor
staff
what
we
call
an
examining
officer
just
now
he
is
doing
night
duty
he
has
a
boat
on
the
river
and
a
couple
of
men
and
the
right
to
board
and
examine
any
craft
whatever
what
mr
hazell
and
his
crew
don
t
know
about
the
thames
between
here
and
gravesend
isn
t
glad
to
meet
you
sir
said
racksole
simply
and
they
shook
hands
racksole
observed
with
satisfaction
that
mr
hazell
was
entirely
at
his
ease
now
hazell
the
high
official
continued
mr
racksole
wants
you
to
help
in
a
little
private
expedition
on
the
river
i
will
give
you
a
night
s
leave
i
sent
for
you
partly
because
i
thought
you
would
enjoy
the
affair
and
partly
because
i
think
i
can
rely
on
you
to
regard
it
as
entirely
unofficial
and
not
to
talk
about
it
you
understand
i
dare
say
you
will
have
no
cause
to
regret
having
obliged
mr
i
think
i
grasp
the
situation
said
hazell
with
a
slight
smile
and
by
the
way
added
the
high
official
although
the
business
is
unofficial
it
might
be
well
if
you
wore
your
official
overcoat
see
decidedly
said
hazell
i
should
have
done
so
in
any
and
now
mr
hazell
said
racksole
will
you
do
me
the
pleasure
of
lunching
with
me
if
you
agree
i
should
like
to
lunch
at
the
place
you
usually
so
it
came
to
pass
that
theodore
racksole
and
george
hazell
outdoor
clerk
in
the
customs
lunched
together
at
thomas
s
in
the
city
of
london
upon
and
coffee
the
millionaire
soon
discovered
that
he
had
got
hold
of
a
man
and
a
person
of
much
insight
tell
me
said
hazell
when
they
had
reached
the
cigarette
stage
are
the
magazine
writers
anything
like
correct
what
do
you
mean
asked
racksole
mystified
well
you
re
a
millionaire
one
of
the
best
i
believe
one
often
sees
articles
on
and
interviews
with
millionaires
which
describe
their
private
railroad
cars
their
steam
yachts
on
the
hudson
their
marble
stables
and
so
on
and
so
on
do
you
happen
to
have
those
things
i
have
a
private
car
on
the
new
york
central
and
i
have
a
two
thousand
ton
though
it
isn
t
on
the
hudson
it
happens
just
now
to
be
on
east
river
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
the
stables
of
my
uptown
place
are
fitted
with
racksole
laughed
ah
said
hazell
now
i
can
believe
that
i
am
lunching
with
a
millionaire
it
s
strange
how
facts
like
those
unimportant
in
themselves
appeal
to
the
imagination
you
seem
to
me
a
real
millionaire
now
you
ve
given
me
some
personal
information
i
ll
give
you
some
in
return
i
earn
three
hundred
a
year
and
perhaps
sixty
pounds
a
year
extra
for
overtime
i
live
by
myself
in
two
rooms
in
muscovy
court
i
ve
as
much
money
as
i
need
and
i
always
do
exactly
what
i
like
outside
office
as
regards
the
office
i
do
as
little
work
as
i
can
on
principle
it
s
a
fight
between
us
and
the
commissioners
who
shall
get
the
best
they
try
to
do
us
down
and
we
try
to
do
them
down
it
s
pretty
even
on
the
whole
all
s
fair
in
war
you
know
and
there
ain
t
no
ten
commandments
in
a
government
racksole
laughed
can
you
get
off
this
afternoon
he
asked
certainly
said
hazell
i
ll
get
one
of
my
pals
to
sign
on
for
me
and
then
i
shall
be
well
said
racksole
i
should
like
you
to
come
down
with
me
to
the
grand
babylon
then
we
can
talk
over
my
little
affair
at
length
and
may
we
go
on
your
boat
i
want
to
meet
your
that
will
be
all
right
hazell
remarked
my
two
men
are
the
idlest
most
chaps
you
ever
saw
they
eat
too
much
and
they
have
an
enormous
appetite
for
beer
but
they
know
the
river
and
they
know
their
business
and
they
will
do
anything
within
the
fair
game
if
they
are
paid
for
it
and
aren
t
asked
to
that
night
just
after
dark
theodore
racksole
embarked
with
his
new
friend
george
hazell
in
one
of
the
customs
wherries
manned
by
a
crew
of
two
men
both
the
later
freemen
of
the
river
a
distinction
which
carries
with
it
certain
privileges
unfamiliar
to
the
mere
landsman
it
was
a
cloudy
and
oppressive
evening
not
a
star
showing
to
illumine
the
slow
tide
now
just
past
its
flood
the
vast
forms
of
steamers
at
anchor
chiefly
those
of
the
general
steam
navigation
and
the
aberdeen
line
heaved
themselves
high
out
of
the
water
straining
sluggishly
at
their
mooring
buoys
on
either
side
the
naked
walls
of
warehouses
rose
like
grey
precipices
from
the
stream
holding
forth
quaint
arms
of
to
the
west
the
tower
bridge
spanned
the
river
with
its
formidable
arch
and
above
that
its
suspended
footpath
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
earth
down
towards
the
east
and
the
pool
of
london
a
forest
of
funnels
and
masts
was
dimly
outlined
against
the
sinister
sky
huge
barges
each
steered
by
a
single
man
at
the
end
of
a
pair
of
giant
oars
lumbered
and
swirled
at
all
angles
occasionally
a
tug
snorted
busily
past
flashing
its
red
and
green
signals
and
dragging
an
unwieldy
tail
of
barges
in
its
wake
then
a
margate
passenger
steamer
its
electric
lights
gleaming
from
every
porthole
swerved
round
to
anchor
with
its
load
of
two
thousand
fatigued
excursionists
over
everything
brooded
an
air
of
mystery
a
spirit
and
feeling
of
strangeness
remoteness
and
the
inexplicable
as
the
broad
flat
little
boat
bobbed
its
way
under
the
shadow
of
enormous
hulks
beneath
stretched
hawsers
and
past
buoys
covered
with
green
slime
racksole
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
was
in
the
very
heart
of
london
the
most
prosaic
city
in
the
world
he
had
a
queer
idea
that
almost
anything
might
happen
in
this
seeming
waste
of
waters
at
this
weird
hour
of
ten
o
clock
it
appeared
incredible
to
him
that
only
a
mile
or
two
away
people
were
sitting
in
theatres
applauding
farces
and
that
at
cannon
street
station
a
few
yards
off
other
people
were
calmly
taking
the
train
to
various
highly
respectable
suburbs
whose
names
he
was
gradually
learning
he
had
the
uplifting
sensation
of
being
in
another
world
which
comes
to
us
sometimes
amid
surroundings
violently
different
from
our
usual
surroundings
the
most
ordinary
noises
of
men
calling
of
a
chain
running
through
a
slot
of
a
distant
siren
translated
themselves
to
his
ears
into
terrible
and
haunting
sounds
full
of
portentous
significance
he
looked
over
the
side
of
the
boat
into
the
brown
water
and
asked
himself
what
frightful
secrets
lay
hidden
in
its
depth
then
he
put
his
hand
into
his
and
touched
the
stock
of
his
colt
revolver
that
familiar
substance
comforted
him
the
oarsmen
had
instructions
to
drop
slowly
down
to
the
pool
as
the
wide
reach
below
the
tower
is
called
these
two
men
had
not
been
previously
informed
of
the
precise
object
of
the
expedition
but
now
that
they
were
safely
afloat
hazell
judged
it
expedient
to
give
them
some
notion
of
it
we
expect
to
come
across
a
rather
suspicious
steam
launch
he
said
my
friend
here
is
very
anxious
to
get
a
sight
of
her
and
until
he
has
seen
her
nothing
definite
can
be
what
sort
of
a
craft
is
she
sir
asked
the
stroke
oar
a
man
who
seemed
absolutely
incapable
of
any
serious
exertion
i
don
t
know
racksole
replied
but
as
near
as
i
can
judge
she
s
about
sixty
feet
in
length
and
painted
black
i
fancy
i
shall
recognize
her
when
i
see
not
much
to
go
by
that
exclaimed
the
other
man
curtly
but
he
said
no
more
he
as
well
as
his
mate
had
received
from
theodore
racksole
one
english
sovereign
as
a
kind
of
preliminary
fee
and
an
english
sovereign
will
do
a
lot
towards
silencing
the
natural
sarcastic
tendencies
and
free
speech
of
a
thames
waterman
there
s
one
thing
i
noticed
said
racksole
suddenly
and
i
forgot
to
tell
you
of
it
mr
hazell
her
screw
seemed
to
move
with
a
rather
irregular
lame
sort
of
both
watermen
burst
into
a
laugh
oh
said
the
fat
rower
i
know
what
you
re
after
sir
it
s
jack
everett
s
launch
commonly
called
squirm
she
s
got
a
propeller
and
one
blade
is
broken
off
ay
that
s
it
sure
enough
agreed
the
man
in
the
bows
and
if
it
s
her
you
want
i
seed
her
lying
up
against
cherry
gardens
pier
this
very
let
us
go
to
cherry
gardens
pier
by
all
means
as
soon
as
possible
racksole
said
and
the
boat
swung
across
stream
and
then
began
to
creep
down
by
the
right
bank
feeling
its
way
past
wharves
many
of
which
even
at
that
hour
were
still
busy
with
their
cranes
that
descended
empty
into
the
bellies
of
ships
and
came
up
full
as
the
two
watermen
gingerly
manoeuvred
the
boat
on
the
ebbing
tide
hazell
explained
to
the
millionaire
that
the
squirm
was
one
of
the
most
notorious
craft
on
the
river
it
appeared
that
when
anyone
had
a
nefarious
or
underhand
scheme
afoot
which
necessitated
river
work
everett
s
launch
was
always
available
for
a
suitable
monetary
consideration
the
squirm
had
got
itself
into
a
thousand
scrapes
and
out
of
those
scrapes
again
with
safety
if
not
precisely
with
honour
the
river
police
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
it
and
the
chief
marvel
about
the
whole
thing
was
that
old
everett
the
owner
had
never
yet
been
seriously
compromised
in
any
illegal
escapade
not
once
had
the
officer
of
the
law
been
able
to
prove
anything
definite
against
the
proprietor
of
the
squirm
though
several
of
its
quondam
hirers
were
at
that
very
moment
in
various
of
her
majesty
s
prisons
throughout
the
country
latterly
however
the
launch
with
its
damaged
propeller
which
everett
consistently
refused
to
have
repaired
had
acquired
an
evil
reputation
even
among
and
this
fraternity
had
gradually
come
to
abandon
it
for
less
easily
recognizable
craft
your
friend
mr
tom
jackson
said
hazell
to
racksole
committed
an
error
of
discretion
when
he
hired
the
squirm
a
scoundrel
of
his
experience
and
calibre
ought
certainly
to
have
known
better
than
that
you
can
not
fail
to
get
a
clue
by
this
time
the
boat
was
approaching
cherry
gardens
pier
but
unfortunately
a
thin
had
swept
over
the
river
and
objects
could
not
be
discerned
with
any
clearness
beyond
a
distance
of
thirty
yards
as
the
customs
boat
scraped
down
past
the
pier
all
its
occupants
strained
eyes
for
a
glimpse
of
the
mysterious
launch
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
it
the
boat
continued
to
float
idly
the
men
resting
on
their
oars
then
they
narrowly
escaped
bumping
a
large
norwegian
sailing
vessel
at
anchor
with
her
stem
pointing
this
ship
they
passed
on
the
port
side
just
as
they
got
clear
of
her
bowsprit
the
fat
man
cried
out
excitedly
there
s
her
nose
and
he
put
the
boat
about
and
began
to
pull
back
against
the
tide
and
surely
the
missing
squirm
was
comfortably
anchored
on
the
starboard
quarter
of
the
norwegian
ship
hidden
neatly
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
the
men
pulled
very
quietly
alongside
chapter
the
night
chase
and
the
mudlark
i
ll
board
her
to
start
with
said
hazell
whispering
to
racksole
i
ll
make
out
that
i
suspect
they
ve
got
dutiable
goods
on
board
and
that
will
give
me
a
chance
to
have
a
good
look
at
dressed
in
his
official
overcoat
and
peaked
cap
he
stepped
rather
jauntily
as
racksole
thought
on
to
the
low
deck
of
the
launch
anyone
aboard
racksole
heard
him
cry
out
and
a
woman
s
voice
answered
i
m
a
customs
examining
officer
and
i
want
to
search
the
launch
hazell
shouted
and
then
disappeared
down
into
the
little
saloon
amidships
and
racksole
heard
no
more
it
seemed
to
the
millionaire
that
hazell
had
been
gone
hours
but
at
length
he
returned
can
t
find
anything
he
said
as
he
jumped
into
the
boat
and
then
privately
to
racksole
there
s
a
woman
on
board
looks
as
if
she
might
coincide
with
your
description
of
miss
spencer
steam
s
up
but
there
s
no
engineer
i
asked
where
the
engineer
was
and
she
inquired
what
business
that
was
of
mine
and
requested
me
to
get
through
with
my
own
business
and
clear
off
seems
rather
a
smart
sort
i
poked
my
nose
into
everything
but
i
saw
no
sign
of
any
one
else
perhaps
we
d
better
pull
away
and
lie
near
for
a
bit
just
to
see
if
anything
queer
you
re
quite
sure
he
isn
t
on
board
racksole
asked
quite
said
hazell
positively
i
know
how
to
search
a
vessel
see
this
and
he
handed
to
racksole
a
sort
of
steel
skewer
about
two
feet
long
with
a
wooden
handle
that
he
said
is
one
of
the
customs
aids
to
i
suppose
it
wouldn
t
do
to
go
on
board
and
carry
off
the
lady
racksole
suggested
doubtfully
well
hazell
began
with
equal
doubtfulness
as
for
that
where
s
e
orf
it
was
the
man
in
the
bows
who
interrupted
hazell
following
the
direction
of
the
man
s
finger
both
hazell
and
racksole
saw
with
more
or
less
distinctness
a
dinghy
slip
away
from
the
forefoot
of
the
norwegian
vessel
and
disappear
downstream
into
the
mist
it
s
jules
i
ll
swear
cried
racksole
after
him
men
ten
pounds
apiece
if
we
overtake
him
lay
down
to
it
now
boys
said
hazell
and
the
heavy
customs
boat
shot
out
in
pursuit
this
is
going
to
be
a
lark
racksole
remarked
depends
on
what
you
call
a
lark
said
hazell
it
s
not
much
of
a
lark
tearing
down
midstream
like
this
in
a
fog
you
never
know
when
you
mayn
t
be
in
kingdom
come
with
all
these
barges
knocking
around
i
expect
that
chap
hid
in
the
dinghy
when
he
first
caught
sight
of
us
and
then
slipped
his
painter
as
soon
as
i
d
the
boat
was
moving
at
a
rapid
pace
with
the
tide
steering
was
a
matter
of
luck
and
instinct
more
than
anything
else
every
now
and
then
hazell
who
held
the
lines
was
obliged
to
jerk
the
boat
s
head
sharply
round
to
avoid
a
barge
or
an
anchored
vessel
it
seemed
to
racksole
that
vessels
were
anchored
all
over
the
stream
he
looked
about
him
anxiously
but
for
a
long
time
he
could
see
nothing
but
mist
and
vague
nautical
forms
then
suddenly
he
said
quietly
enough
we
re
on
the
right
road
i
can
see
him
ahead
we
re
gaining
on
in
another
minute
the
dinghy
was
plainly
visible
not
twenty
yards
away
and
the
sculler
sculling
frantically
now
was
unmistakably
jules
jules
in
a
light
tweed
suit
and
a
bowler
hat
you
were
right
hazell
said
this
is
a
lark
i
believe
i
m
getting
quite
excited
it
s
more
exciting
than
playing
the
trombone
in
an
orchestra
i
ll
run
him
down
eh
and
then
we
can
drag
the
chap
in
from
the
racksole
nodded
but
at
that
moment
a
barge
with
her
red
sails
set
stood
out
of
the
fog
clean
across
the
bows
of
the
customs
boat
which
narrowly
escaped
instant
destruction
when
they
got
clear
and
the
usual
interchange
of
calm
nonchalant
swearing
was
over
the
dinghy
was
barely
to
be
discerned
in
the
mist
and
the
fat
man
was
breathing
in
such
a
manner
that
his
sighs
might
almost
have
been
heard
on
the
banks
racksole
wanted
violently
to
do
something
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
he
could
only
sit
supine
by
hazell
s
side
in
the
gradually
they
began
again
to
overtake
the
dinghy
whose
crew
was
evidently
tiring
as
they
came
up
hand
over
fist
the
dinghy
s
nose
swerved
aside
and
the
tiny
craft
passed
down
a
between
two
anchored
mineral
barges
which
lay
black
and
deserted
about
fifty
yards
from
the
surrey
shore
to
starboard
said
racksole
no
man
hazell
replied
we
can
t
get
through
there
he
s
bound
to
come
out
below
it
s
only
a
feint
i
ll
keep
our
nose
straight
and
they
went
on
the
fat
man
pounding
away
with
a
face
which
glistened
even
in
the
thick
gloom
it
was
an
empty
dinghy
which
emerged
from
between
the
two
barges
and
went
drifting
and
revolving
down
towards
greenwich
the
fat
man
gasped
a
word
to
his
comrade
and
the
customs
boat
stopped
dead
e
s
all
right
said
the
man
in
the
bows
if
it
s
im
you
want
e
s
on
one
o
them
barges
so
you
ve
only
got
to
step
on
and
take
im
that
s
all
said
a
voice
out
of
the
depths
of
the
nearest
barge
and
it
was
the
voice
of
jules
otherwise
known
as
mr
tom
jackson
ear
im
said
the
fat
man
smiling
e
s
a
good
un
e
is
but
if
i
was
you
mr
hazell
or
you
sir
i
shouldn
t
step
on
to
that
barge
so
quick
as
all
they
backed
the
boat
under
the
stem
of
the
nearest
barge
and
gazed
upwards
it
s
all
right
said
racksole
to
hazell
i
ve
got
a
revolver
how
can
i
clamber
up
there
yes
i
dare
say
you
ve
got
a
revolver
all
right
hazell
replied
sharply
but
you
mustn
t
use
it
there
mustn
t
be
any
noise
we
should
have
the
river
police
down
on
us
in
a
twinkling
if
there
was
a
revolver
shot
and
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
me
if
an
inquiry
was
held
the
commissioners
wouldn
t
take
any
official
notice
of
the
fact
that
my
superior
officer
had
put
me
on
to
this
job
and
i
should
be
requested
to
leave
the
have
no
fear
on
that
score
said
racksole
i
shall
of
course
take
all
it
wouldn
t
matter
how
much
responsibility
you
took
hazell
retorted
you
wouldn
t
put
me
back
into
the
service
and
my
career
would
be
at
an
but
there
are
other
careers
said
racksole
who
was
really
anxious
to
lame
his
by
means
of
a
bullet
there
are
other
the
customs
is
my
career
said
hazell
so
let
s
have
no
shooting
we
ll
wait
about
a
bit
he
can
t
escape
you
can
have
my
skewer
if
you
like
and
he
gave
racksole
his
searching
instrument
and
you
can
do
what
you
please
provided
you
do
it
neatly
and
don
t
make
a
row
over
for
a
few
moments
the
four
men
were
passive
in
the
boat
surrounded
by
swirling
mist
with
black
water
beneath
them
and
towering
above
them
a
barge
with
a
desperate
and
resourceful
man
on
board
suddenly
the
mist
parted
and
shrivelled
away
in
patches
as
though
before
the
breath
of
some
monster
the
sky
was
visible
it
was
a
clear
sky
and
the
moon
was
shining
the
transformation
was
just
one
of
those
meteorological
which
happen
most
frequently
on
a
great
river
that
s
a
sight
better
said
the
fat
man
at
the
same
moment
a
head
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
barge
it
was
jules
face
dark
sinister
and
leering
is
it
mr
racksole
in
that
boat
he
inquired
calmly
because
if
so
let
mr
racksole
step
up
mr
racksole
has
caught
me
and
he
can
have
me
for
the
asking
here
i
he
stood
up
to
his
full
height
on
the
barge
tall
against
the
night
sky
and
all
the
occupants
of
the
boat
could
see
that
he
held
firmly
clasped
in
his
right
hand
a
short
dagger
now
mr
racksole
you
ve
been
after
me
for
a
long
time
he
continued
here
i
am
why
don
t
you
step
up
if
you
haven
t
got
the
pluck
yourself
persuade
someone
else
to
step
up
in
your
place
the
same
fair
treatment
will
be
accorded
to
and
jules
laughed
a
low
penetrating
laugh
he
was
in
the
midst
of
this
laugh
when
he
lurched
suddenly
forward
what
r
you
doing
of
aboard
my
barge
off
you
goes
it
was
a
boy
s
small
shrill
voice
that
sounded
in
the
night
a
ragged
boy
s
small
form
had
appeared
silently
behind
jules
and
two
small
arms
with
a
vicious
shove
precipitated
him
into
the
water
he
fell
with
a
fine
gurgling
splash
it
was
at
once
obvious
that
swimming
was
not
among
jules
accomplishments
he
floundered
wildly
and
sank
when
he
reappeared
he
was
dragged
into
the
customs
boat
rope
was
produced
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
man
lay
ignominiously
bound
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
the
aid
of
a
mudlark
a
mere
barge
boy
who
probably
had
no
more
right
on
the
barge
than
jules
himself
racksole
had
won
his
game
for
the
first
time
for
several
weeks
the
millionaire
experienced
a
sensation
of
equanimity
and
satisfaction
he
leaned
over
the
prostrate
form
of
jules
hazell
s
professional
skewer
in
his
hand
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
now
asked
hazell
we
ll
row
up
to
the
landing
steps
in
front
of
the
grand
babylon
he
shall
be
well
lodged
at
my
hotel
i
promise
jules
spoke
no
word
before
racksole
parted
company
with
the
customs
man
that
night
jules
had
been
safely
transported
into
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
and
the
two
watermen
had
received
their
apiece
you
will
sleep
here
said
the
millionaire
to
mr
george
hazell
it
is
with
pleasure
said
hazell
the
next
morning
he
found
a
sumptuous
breakfast
awaiting
him
and
in
his
was
a
bank
of
england
note
for
a
hundred
pounds
but
though
he
did
not
hear
of
them
till
much
later
many
things
had
happened
before
hazell
consumed
that
sumptuous
breakfast
chapter
the
confession
of
mr
tom
jackson
it
happened
that
the
small
bedroom
occupied
by
jules
during
the
years
he
was
at
the
grand
babylon
had
remained
empty
since
his
sudden
dismissal
by
theodore
racksole
no
other
had
been
formally
appointed
in
his
place
and
indeed
the
absence
of
one
man
even
the
unique
jules
could
scarcely
have
been
noticed
in
the
enormous
staff
of
a
place
like
the
grand
babylon
the
functions
of
a
are
generally
more
ornamental
spectacular
and
morally
impressive
than
useful
and
it
was
so
at
the
great
hotel
on
the
embankment
racksole
accordingly
had
the
excellent
idea
of
transporting
his
prisoner
with
as
much
secrecy
as
possible
to
this
empty
bedroom
there
proved
to
be
no
difficulty
in
doing
so
jules
showed
himself
perfectly
amenable
to
a
show
of
superior
force
racksole
took
upstairs
with
him
an
old
commissionaire
who
had
been
attached
to
the
outdoor
service
of
the
hotel
for
many
years
a
haired
man
wiry
as
a
terrier
and
strong
as
a
mastiff
entering
the
bedroom
with
jules
whose
hands
were
bound
he
told
the
commissionaire
to
remain
outside
the
door
jules
bedroom
was
quite
an
ordinary
apartment
though
perhaps
slightly
superior
to
the
usual
accommodation
provided
for
servants
in
the
caravanserais
of
the
west
end
it
was
about
fourteen
by
twelve
it
was
furnished
with
a
bedstead
a
small
wardrobe
a
small
washstand
and
and
two
chairs
there
were
two
hooks
behind
the
door
a
strip
of
carpet
by
the
bed
and
some
cheap
ornaments
on
the
iron
mantelpiece
there
was
also
one
electric
light
the
window
was
a
little
square
one
high
up
from
the
floor
and
it
looked
on
the
inner
quadrangle
the
room
was
on
the
top
storey
the
eighth
and
from
it
you
had
a
view
sheer
to
the
ground
twenty
feet
below
ran
a
narrow
cornice
about
a
foot
wide
three
feet
or
so
above
the
window
another
and
wider
cornice
jutted
out
and
above
that
was
the
high
steep
roof
of
the
hotel
though
you
could
not
see
it
from
the
window
as
racksole
examined
the
window
and
the
outlook
he
said
to
himself
that
jules
could
not
escape
by
that
exit
at
any
rate
he
gave
a
glance
up
the
chimney
and
saw
that
the
flue
was
far
too
small
to
admit
a
man
s
body
then
he
called
in
the
commissionaire
and
together
they
bound
jules
firmly
to
the
bedstead
allowing
him
however
to
lie
down
all
the
while
the
captive
never
opened
his
mouth
merely
smiled
a
smile
of
disdain
finally
racksole
removed
the
ornaments
the
carpet
the
chairs
and
the
hooks
and
wrenched
away
the
switch
of
the
electric
light
then
he
and
the
commissionaire
left
the
room
and
racksole
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
you
will
keep
watch
here
he
said
to
the
commissionaire
through
the
night
you
can
sit
on
this
chair
don
t
go
to
sleep
if
you
hear
the
slightest
noise
in
the
room
blow
your
i
will
arrange
to
answer
the
signal
if
there
is
no
noise
do
nothing
whatever
i
don
t
want
this
talked
about
you
understand
i
shall
trust
you
you
can
trust
but
the
servants
will
see
me
here
when
they
get
up
said
the
commissionaire
with
a
faint
smile
and
they
will
be
pretty
certain
to
ask
what
i
m
doing
of
up
here
what
shall
i
say
to
em
you
ve
been
a
soldier
haven
t
you
asked
racksole
i
ve
seen
three
campaigns
sir
was
the
reply
and
with
a
gesture
of
pardonable
pride
the
fellow
pointed
to
the
medals
on
his
breast
well
supposing
you
were
on
sentry
duty
and
some
meddlesome
person
in
camp
asked
you
what
you
were
doing
what
should
you
say
i
should
tell
him
to
clear
off
or
take
the
consequences
and
pretty
quick
do
that
morning
then
if
necessary
said
racksole
and
departed
it
was
then
about
one
o
clock
the
millionaire
retired
to
bed
not
his
own
bed
but
a
bed
on
the
seventh
storey
he
did
not
however
sleep
very
long
shortly
after
dawn
he
was
wide
awake
and
thinking
busily
about
jules
he
was
indeed
very
curious
to
know
jules
story
and
he
determined
if
the
thing
could
be
done
at
all
by
persuasion
or
otherwise
to
extract
it
from
him
with
a
man
of
theodore
racksole
s
temperament
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
and
at
six
o
clock
as
the
bright
morning
sun
brought
gaiety
into
the
window
he
dressed
and
went
upstairs
again
to
the
eighth
storey
the
commissionaire
sat
stolid
but
alert
on
his
chair
and
at
the
sight
of
his
master
rose
and
saluted
anything
happened
racksole
asked
nothing
servants
say
anything
only
a
dozen
or
so
of
em
are
up
yet
sir
one
of
em
asked
what
i
was
playing
at
and
so
i
told
her
i
was
looking
after
a
bull
bitch
and
a
litter
of
pups
that
you
was
very
particular
about
good
said
racksole
as
he
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
the
room
all
was
exactly
as
he
had
left
it
except
that
jules
who
had
been
lying
on
his
back
had
somehow
turned
over
and
was
now
lying
on
his
face
he
gazed
silently
scowling
at
the
millionaire
racksole
greeted
him
and
ostentatiously
took
a
revolver
from
his
and
laid
it
on
the
then
he
seated
himself
on
the
by
the
side
of
the
revolver
his
legs
dangling
an
inch
or
two
above
the
floor
i
want
to
have
a
talk
to
you
jackson
he
began
you
can
talk
to
me
as
much
as
you
like
said
jules
i
shan
t
interfere
you
may
bet
on
i
should
like
you
to
answer
some
that
s
different
said
jules
i
m
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
while
i
m
tied
up
like
this
you
may
bet
on
that
it
will
pay
you
to
be
reasonable
said
racksole
i
m
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
while
i
m
tied
i
ll
unfasten
your
legs
if
you
like
racksole
suggested
politely
then
you
can
sit
up
it
s
no
use
you
pretending
you
ve
been
uncomfortable
because
i
know
you
haven
t
i
calculate
you
ve
been
treated
very
handsomely
my
son
there
you
are
and
he
loosened
the
lower
extremities
of
his
prisoner
from
their
bonds
now
i
repeat
you
may
as
well
be
reasonable
you
may
as
well
admit
that
you
ve
been
fairly
beaten
in
the
game
and
act
accordingly
i
was
determined
to
beat
you
by
myself
without
the
police
and
i
ve
done
you
ve
done
yourself
retorted
jules
you
ve
gone
against
the
law
if
you
d
had
any
sense
you
wouldn
t
have
meddled
you
d
have
left
everything
to
the
police
they
d
have
muddled
about
for
a
year
or
two
and
then
done
nothing
who
s
going
to
tell
the
police
now
are
you
are
you
going
to
give
me
up
to
em
and
say
here
i
ve
caught
him
for
you
if
you
do
they
ll
ask
you
to
explain
several
things
and
then
you
ll
look
foolish
one
crime
doesn
t
excuse
another
and
you
ll
find
that
with
unerring
insight
jules
had
perceived
exactly
the
difficulty
of
racksole
s
position
and
it
was
certainly
a
difficulty
which
racksole
did
not
attempt
to
minimize
to
himself
he
knew
well
that
it
would
have
to
be
faced
he
did
not
however
allow
jules
to
guess
his
thoughts
meanwhile
he
said
calmly
to
the
other
you
re
here
and
my
prisoner
you
ve
committed
a
variegated
assortment
of
crimes
and
among
them
is
murder
you
are
due
to
be
hung
you
know
that
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
call
in
the
police
at
all
it
will
be
perfectly
easy
for
me
to
finish
you
off
as
you
deserve
myself
i
shall
only
be
carrying
out
justice
and
robbing
the
hangman
of
his
fee
precisely
as
i
brought
you
into
the
hotel
i
can
take
you
out
again
a
few
days
ago
you
borrowed
or
stole
a
steam
yacht
at
ostend
what
you
have
done
with
it
i
don
t
know
nor
do
i
care
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
my
daughter
had
a
narrow
escape
of
being
murdered
on
your
steam
yacht
now
i
have
a
steam
yacht
of
my
own
suppose
i
use
it
as
you
used
yours
suppose
i
smuggle
you
on
to
it
steam
out
to
sea
and
then
ask
you
to
step
off
it
into
the
ocean
one
night
such
things
have
been
done
such
things
will
be
done
again
if
i
acted
so
i
should
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
had
relieved
society
from
the
incubus
of
a
but
you
won
t
jules
murmured
no
said
racksole
steadily
i
won
t
if
you
behave
yourself
this
morning
but
i
swear
to
you
that
if
you
don
t
i
will
never
rest
till
you
are
dead
police
or
no
police
you
don
t
know
theodore
i
believe
you
mean
it
jules
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
surprised
interest
as
though
he
had
discovered
something
of
importance
i
believe
i
do
racksole
resumed
now
listen
at
the
best
you
will
be
given
up
to
the
police
at
the
worst
i
shall
deal
with
you
myself
with
the
police
you
may
have
a
chance
you
may
get
off
with
twenty
years
penal
servitude
because
though
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
you
murdered
reginald
dimmock
it
would
be
a
little
difficult
to
prove
the
case
against
you
but
with
me
you
would
have
no
chance
whatever
i
have
a
few
questions
to
put
to
you
and
it
will
depend
on
how
you
answer
them
whether
i
give
you
up
to
the
police
or
take
the
law
into
my
own
hands
and
let
me
tell
you
that
the
latter
course
would
be
much
simpler
for
me
and
i
would
take
it
too
did
i
not
feel
that
you
were
a
very
clever
and
exceptional
man
did
i
not
have
a
sort
of
sneaking
admiration
for
your
detestable
skill
and
you
think
then
that
i
am
clever
said
jules
you
are
right
i
am
i
should
have
been
much
too
clever
for
you
if
luck
had
not
been
against
me
you
owe
your
victory
not
to
skill
but
to
that
is
what
the
vanquished
always
say
waterloo
was
a
bit
of
pure
luck
for
the
english
no
doubt
but
it
was
waterloo
all
the
jules
yawned
elaborately
what
do
you
want
to
know
he
inquired
with
politeness
first
and
foremost
i
want
to
know
the
names
of
your
accomplices
inside
this
i
have
no
more
said
jules
rocco
was
the
don
t
begin
by
lying
to
me
if
you
had
no
accomplice
how
did
you
contrive
that
one
particular
bottle
of
should
be
served
to
his
highness
prince
eugen
then
you
discovered
that
in
time
did
you
said
jules
i
was
afraid
so
let
me
explain
that
that
needed
no
accomplice
the
bottle
was
topmost
in
the
bin
and
naturally
it
would
be
taken
moreover
i
left
it
sticking
out
a
little
further
than
the
you
did
not
arrange
then
that
hubbard
should
be
taken
ill
the
night
before
last
i
had
no
idea
said
jules
that
the
excellent
hubbard
was
not
enjoying
his
accustomed
tell
me
said
racksole
who
or
what
is
the
origin
of
your
vendetta
against
the
life
of
prince
eugen
i
had
no
vendetta
against
the
life
of
prince
eugen
said
jules
at
least
not
to
begin
with
i
merely
undertook
for
a
consideration
to
see
that
prince
eugen
did
not
have
an
interview
with
a
certain
mr
sampson
levi
in
london
before
a
certain
date
that
was
all
it
seemed
simple
enough
i
had
been
engaged
in
far
more
complicated
transactions
before
i
was
convinced
that
i
could
manage
it
with
the
help
of
rocco
and
em
and
miss
is
that
woman
your
wife
she
would
like
to
be
he
sneered
please
don
t
interrupt
i
had
completed
my
arrangements
when
you
so
inconsiderately
bought
the
hotel
i
don
t
mind
admitting
now
that
from
the
very
moment
when
you
came
across
me
that
night
in
the
corridor
i
was
secretly
afraid
of
you
though
i
scarcely
admitted
the
fact
even
to
myself
then
i
thought
it
safer
to
shift
the
scene
of
our
operations
to
ostend
i
had
meant
to
deal
with
prince
eugen
in
this
hotel
but
i
decided
then
to
intercept
him
on
the
continent
and
i
despatched
miss
spencer
with
some
instructions
troubles
never
come
singly
and
it
happened
that
just
then
that
fool
dimmock
who
had
been
in
the
swim
with
us
chose
to
prove
refractory
the
slightest
hitch
would
have
upset
everything
and
i
was
obliged
to
to
clear
him
off
the
scene
he
wanted
to
back
out
he
had
a
bad
attack
of
conscience
and
violent
measures
were
essential
i
regret
his
untimely
decease
but
he
brought
it
on
himself
well
everything
was
going
serenely
when
you
and
your
brilliant
daughter
apparently
determined
to
meddle
turned
up
again
among
us
at
ostend
only
four
hours
however
had
to
elapse
before
the
date
which
had
been
mentioned
to
me
by
my
employers
i
kept
poor
little
eugen
for
the
allotted
time
and
then
you
managed
to
get
hold
of
him
i
do
not
deny
that
you
scored
there
though
according
to
my
original
instructions
you
scored
too
late
the
time
had
passed
and
so
so
far
as
i
knew
it
didn
t
matter
a
pin
whether
prince
eugen
saw
mr
sampson
levi
or
not
but
my
employers
were
still
uneasy
they
were
uneasy
even
after
little
eugen
had
lain
ill
in
ostend
for
several
weeks
it
appears
that
they
feared
that
even
at
that
date
an
interview
between
prince
eugen
and
mr
sampson
levi
might
work
harm
to
them
so
they
applied
to
me
again
this
time
they
wanted
prince
eugen
to
be
em
finished
off
entirely
they
offered
high
what
terms
i
had
received
fifty
thousand
pounds
for
the
first
job
of
which
rocco
had
half
rocco
was
also
to
be
made
a
member
of
a
certain
famous
european
order
if
things
went
right
that
was
what
he
coveted
far
more
than
the
money
the
vain
fellow
for
the
second
job
i
was
offered
a
hundred
thousand
a
tolerably
large
sum
i
regret
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
earn
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
asked
racksole
by
this
calm
confession
in
spite
of
his
previous
knowledge
that
you
were
offered
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
poison
prince
eugen
you
put
it
rather
crudely
said
jules
in
reply
i
prefer
to
say
that
i
was
offered
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
if
prince
eugen
should
die
within
a
reasonable
and
who
were
your
damnable
employers
that
honestly
i
do
not
you
know
i
suppose
who
paid
you
the
first
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
who
promised
you
the
hundred
well
said
jules
i
know
vaguely
i
know
that
he
came
via
vienna
from
em
bosnia
my
impression
was
that
the
affair
had
some
bearing
direct
or
indirect
on
the
projected
marriage
of
the
king
of
bosnia
he
is
a
young
monarch
scarcely
out
of
political
as
it
were
and
doubtless
his
ministers
thought
that
they
had
better
arrange
his
marriage
for
him
they
tried
last
year
and
failed
because
the
princess
whom
they
had
in
mind
had
cast
her
sparkling
eyes
on
another
prince
that
prince
happened
to
be
prince
eugen
of
posen
the
ministers
of
the
king
of
bosnia
knew
exactly
the
circumstances
of
prince
eugen
they
knew
that
he
could
not
marry
without
liquidating
his
debts
and
they
knew
that
he
could
only
liquidate
his
debts
through
this
jew
sampson
levi
unfortunately
for
me
they
ultimately
wanted
to
make
too
sure
of
prince
eugen
they
were
afraid
he
might
after
all
arrange
his
marriage
without
the
aid
of
mr
sampson
levi
and
so
well
you
know
the
rest
it
is
a
pity
that
the
poor
little
innocent
king
of
bosnia
can
t
have
the
princess
of
his
ministers
then
you
think
that
the
king
himself
had
no
part
in
this
abominable
crime
i
think
decidedly
i
am
glad
of
that
said
racksole
simply
and
now
the
name
of
your
immediate
he
was
merely
an
agent
he
called
himself
sleszak
but
i
imagine
that
that
wasn
t
his
real
name
i
don
t
know
his
real
name
an
old
man
he
often
used
to
be
found
at
the
hôtel
ritz
mr
sleszak
and
i
will
meet
said
racksole
not
in
this
world
said
jules
quickly
he
is
dead
i
heard
only
last
night
just
before
our
little
there
was
a
silence
it
is
well
said
racksole
at
length
prince
eugen
lives
despite
all
plots
after
all
justice
is
mr
racksole
is
here
but
he
can
see
no
one
the
words
came
from
behind
the
door
and
the
voice
was
the
commissionaire
s
racksole
started
up
and
went
towards
the
door
nonsense
was
the
curt
reply
in
feminine
tones
move
aside
the
door
opened
and
nella
entered
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
oh
dad
she
exclaimed
i
ve
only
just
heard
you
were
in
the
hotel
we
looked
for
you
everywhere
come
at
once
prince
eugen
is
dying
then
she
saw
the
man
sitting
on
the
bed
and
stopped
later
when
jules
was
alone
again
he
remarked
to
himself
i
may
get
that
hundred
chapter
the
state
bedroom
once
more
when
immediately
after
the
episode
of
the
bottle
of
in
the
state
prince
aribert
and
old
hans
found
that
prince
eugen
had
sunk
in
an
unconscious
heap
over
his
chair
both
the
former
thought
at
the
first
instant
that
eugen
must
have
already
tasted
the
poisoned
wine
but
a
moment
s
reflection
showed
that
this
was
not
possible
if
the
hereditary
prince
of
posen
was
dying
or
dead
his
condition
was
due
to
some
other
agency
than
the
aribert
bent
over
him
and
a
powerful
odour
from
the
man
s
lips
at
once
disclosed
the
cause
of
the
disaster
it
was
the
odour
of
laudanum
indeed
the
smell
of
that
sinister
drug
seemed
now
to
float
heavily
over
the
whole
table
across
aribert
s
mind
there
flashed
then
the
true
explanation
prince
eugen
taking
advantage
of
aribert
s
attention
being
momentarily
diverted
and
yielding
to
a
sudden
impulse
of
despair
had
decided
to
poison
himself
and
had
carried
out
his
intention
on
the
spot
the
laudanum
must
have
been
already
in
his
pocket
and
this
fact
went
to
prove
that
the
unfortunate
prince
had
previously
contemplated
such
a
proceeding
even
after
his
definite
promise
aribert
remembered
now
with
painful
vividness
his
nephew
s
words
i
withdraw
my
promise
observe
that
i
withdraw
it
must
have
been
instantly
after
the
utterance
of
that
formal
withdrawal
that
eugen
attempted
to
destroy
himself
it
s
laudanum
hans
aribert
exclaimed
rather
helplessly
surely
his
highness
has
not
taken
poison
said
hans
it
is
impossible
i
fear
it
is
only
too
possible
said
the
other
it
s
laudanum
what
are
we
to
do
quick
man
his
highness
must
be
roused
prince
he
must
have
an
emetic
we
had
better
carry
him
to
the
they
did
and
laid
him
on
the
great
bed
and
then
aribert
mixed
an
emetic
of
mustard
and
water
and
administered
it
but
without
any
effect
the
sufferer
lay
motionless
with
every
muscle
relaxed
his
skin
was
to
the
touch
and
the
eyelids
showed
that
the
pupils
were
painfully
contracted
go
out
and
send
for
a
doctor
hans
say
that
prince
eugen
has
been
suddenly
taken
ill
but
that
it
isn
t
serious
the
truth
must
never
be
he
must
be
roused
sire
hans
said
again
as
he
hurried
from
the
room
aribert
lifted
his
nephew
from
the
bed
shook
him
pinched
him
flicked
him
cruelly
shouted
at
him
dragged
him
about
but
to
no
avail
at
length
he
desisted
from
mere
physical
fatigue
and
laid
the
prince
back
again
on
the
bed
every
minute
that
elapsed
seemed
an
hour
alone
with
the
unconscious
organism
in
the
silence
of
the
great
stately
chamber
under
the
cold
yellow
glare
of
the
electric
lights
aribert
became
a
prey
to
the
most
despairing
thoughts
the
tragedy
of
his
nephew
s
career
forced
itself
upon
him
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
an
early
and
shameful
death
had
all
along
been
inevitable
for
this
unhappy
child
of
a
historic
throne
a
little
good
fortune
and
his
character
so
evenly
balanced
between
right
and
wrong
might
have
followed
the
proper
path
and
eugen
might
have
figured
at
any
rate
with
dignity
on
the
european
stage
but
now
it
appeared
that
all
was
over
the
last
stroke
played
and
in
this
disaster
aribert
saw
the
ruin
of
his
own
hopes
for
aribert
would
have
to
occupy
his
nephew
s
throne
and
he
felt
instinctively
that
nature
had
not
cut
him
out
for
a
throne
by
a
natural
impulse
he
inwardly
rebelled
against
the
prospect
of
monarchy
monarchy
meant
so
much
for
which
he
knew
himself
to
be
entirely
unfitted
it
meant
a
political
marriage
which
means
a
forced
marriage
a
union
against
inclination
and
then
what
of
nella
nella
hans
returned
i
have
sent
for
the
nearest
doctor
and
also
for
a
specialist
he
said
good
said
aribert
i
hope
they
will
then
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
card
take
this
yourself
to
miss
racksole
if
she
is
out
of
the
hotel
ascertain
where
she
is
and
follow
her
understand
it
is
of
the
first
hans
bowed
and
departed
for
the
second
time
and
aribert
was
alone
again
he
gazed
at
eugen
and
made
another
frantic
attempt
to
rouse
him
from
the
deadly
stupor
but
it
was
useless
he
walked
away
to
the
window
through
the
opened
casement
he
could
hear
the
tinkle
of
passing
hansoms
on
the
embankment
below
whistles
of
and
the
hoot
of
steam
tugs
on
the
river
the
world
went
on
as
usual
it
appeared
it
was
an
absurd
world
he
desired
nothing
better
than
to
abandon
his
princely
title
and
live
as
a
plain
man
the
husband
of
the
finest
woman
on
earth
but
now
pah
how
selfish
he
was
to
be
thinking
of
himself
when
eugen
lay
dying
yet
nella
the
door
opened
and
a
man
entered
who
was
obviously
the
doctor
a
few
curt
questions
and
he
had
grasped
the
essentials
of
the
case
oblige
me
by
ringing
the
bell
prince
i
shall
want
some
hot
water
and
an
man
and
a
who
wants
a
nurse
said
a
voice
and
nella
came
quietly
in
i
am
a
nurse
she
added
to
the
doctor
and
at
your
the
next
two
hours
were
a
struggle
between
life
and
death
the
first
doctor
a
specialist
who
followed
him
nella
prince
aribert
and
old
hans
formed
as
it
were
a
league
to
save
the
dying
man
none
else
in
the
hotel
knew
the
real
seriousness
of
the
case
when
a
prince
falls
ill
and
especially
by
his
own
act
the
precise
truth
is
not
issued
broadcast
to
the
universe
according
to
official
intelligence
a
prince
is
never
seriously
ill
until
he
is
dead
such
is
statecraft
the
worst
feature
of
prince
eugen
s
case
was
that
emetics
proved
futile
neither
of
the
doctors
could
explain
their
failure
but
it
was
only
too
apparent
the
league
was
reduced
to
helplessness
at
last
the
great
specialist
from
manchester
square
gave
it
out
that
there
was
no
chance
for
prince
eugen
unless
the
natural
vigour
of
his
constitution
should
prove
capable
of
throwing
off
the
poison
unaided
by
scientific
assistance
as
a
drunkard
can
sleep
off
his
potion
everything
had
been
tried
even
to
artificial
respiration
and
the
injection
of
hot
coffee
having
emitted
this
pronouncement
the
great
specialist
from
manchester
square
left
it
was
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
by
one
of
those
strange
and
futile
coincidences
which
sometimes
startle
us
by
their
subtle
significance
the
specialist
met
theodore
racksole
and
his
captive
as
they
were
entering
the
hotel
neither
had
the
least
suspicion
of
the
other
s
business
in
the
state
bedroom
the
small
group
of
watchers
surrounded
the
bed
the
slow
minutes
filed
away
in
dreary
procession
another
hour
passed
then
the
figure
on
the
bed
hitherto
so
motionless
twitched
and
moved
the
lips
parted
there
is
hope
said
the
doctor
and
administered
a
stimulant
which
was
handed
to
him
by
nella
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
patient
had
regained
consciousness
for
the
ten
thousandth
time
in
the
history
of
medicine
a
sound
constitution
had
accomplished
a
miracle
impossible
to
the
accumulated
medical
skill
of
centuries
in
due
course
the
doctor
left
saying
that
prince
eugen
was
on
the
high
road
to
recovery
and
promising
to
come
again
within
a
few
hours
morning
had
dawned
nella
drew
the
great
curtains
and
let
in
a
flood
of
sunlight
old
hans
overcome
by
fatigue
dozed
in
a
chair
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
the
reaction
had
been
too
much
for
him
nella
and
prince
aribert
looked
at
each
other
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
about
themselves
yet
each
knew
what
the
other
had
been
thinking
they
clasped
hands
with
a
perfect
understanding
their
brief
had
been
of
the
silent
kind
and
it
was
silent
now
no
word
was
uttered
a
shadow
had
passed
from
over
them
but
only
their
eyes
expressed
relief
and
joy
aribert
the
faint
call
came
from
the
bed
aribert
went
to
the
bedside
while
nella
remained
near
the
window
what
is
it
eugen
he
said
you
are
better
you
think
so
murmured
the
other
i
want
you
to
forgive
me
for
all
this
aribert
i
must
have
caused
you
an
intolerable
trouble
i
did
it
so
clumsily
that
is
what
annoys
me
laudanum
was
a
feeble
expedient
but
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
i
daren
t
ask
anyone
for
advice
i
was
obliged
to
go
out
and
buy
the
stuff
for
myself
it
was
all
very
awkward
but
thank
goodness
it
has
not
been
what
do
you
mean
eugen
you
are
better
in
a
day
or
so
you
will
be
perfectly
i
am
dying
said
eugen
quietly
do
not
be
deceived
i
die
because
i
wish
to
die
it
is
bound
to
be
so
i
know
by
the
feel
of
my
heart
in
a
few
hours
it
will
be
over
the
throne
of
posen
will
be
yours
aribert
you
will
fill
it
more
worthily
than
i
have
done
don
t
let
them
know
over
there
that
i
poisoned
myself
swear
hans
to
secrecy
swear
the
doctors
to
secrecy
and
breathe
no
word
yourself
i
have
been
a
fool
but
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
known
that
i
was
also
a
coward
perhaps
it
is
not
cowardice
perhaps
it
is
courage
after
all
courage
to
cut
the
knot
i
could
not
have
survived
the
disgrace
of
any
revelations
aribert
and
revelations
would
have
been
sure
to
come
i
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
but
i
am
ready
to
pay
for
it
we
of
posen
we
always
pay
everything
except
our
debts
ah
those
debts
had
it
not
been
for
those
i
could
have
faced
her
who
was
to
have
been
my
wife
to
have
shared
my
throne
i
could
have
hidden
my
past
and
begun
again
with
her
help
i
really
could
have
begun
again
but
fate
has
been
against
me
always
always
by
the
way
what
was
that
plot
against
me
aribert
i
forget
i
his
eyes
closed
there
was
a
sudden
noise
old
hans
had
slipped
from
his
chair
to
the
floor
he
picked
himself
up
dazed
and
crept
shamefacedly
out
of
the
room
aribert
took
his
nephew
s
hand
nonsense
eugen
you
are
dreaming
you
will
be
all
right
soon
pull
yourself
all
because
of
a
million
the
sick
man
moaned
one
miserable
million
english
pounds
the
national
debt
of
posen
is
fifty
millions
and
i
the
prince
of
posen
couldn
t
borrow
one
if
i
could
have
got
it
i
might
have
held
my
head
up
again
aribert
who
is
that
girl
aribert
looked
up
nella
was
standing
silent
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
her
eyes
moist
she
came
round
to
the
bedside
and
put
her
hand
on
the
patient
s
heart
scarcely
could
she
feel
its
pulsation
and
to
aribert
her
eyes
expressed
a
sudden
despair
at
that
moment
hans
the
room
and
beckoned
to
her
i
have
heard
that
herr
racksole
has
returned
to
the
hotel
he
whispered
and
that
he
has
captured
that
man
jules
who
they
say
is
such
a
several
times
during
the
night
nella
inquired
for
her
father
but
could
gain
no
knowledge
of
his
whereabouts
now
at
six
in
the
morning
a
rumour
had
mysteriously
spread
among
the
servants
of
the
hotel
about
the
happenings
of
the
night
before
how
it
had
originated
no
one
could
have
determined
but
it
had
originated
where
is
my
father
nella
asked
of
hans
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
pointed
upwards
somewhere
at
the
top
they
nella
almost
ran
out
of
the
room
her
interruption
of
the
interview
between
jules
and
theodore
racksole
has
already
been
described
as
she
came
downstairs
with
her
father
she
said
again
prince
eugen
is
dying
but
i
think
you
can
save
i
exclaimed
theodore
yes
she
repeated
positively
i
will
tell
you
what
i
want
you
to
do
and
you
must
do
chapter
theodore
is
called
to
the
rescue
as
nella
passed
downstairs
from
the
top
storey
with
her
father
the
lifts
had
not
yet
begun
to
work
she
drew
him
into
her
own
room
and
closed
the
door
what
s
this
all
about
he
asked
somewhat
mystified
and
even
alarmed
by
the
extreme
seriousness
of
her
face
dad
the
girl
began
you
are
very
rich
aren
t
you
very
very
rich
she
smiled
anxiously
timidly
he
did
not
remember
to
have
seen
that
expression
on
her
face
before
he
wanted
to
make
a
facetious
reply
but
checked
himself
yes
he
said
i
am
you
ought
to
know
that
by
this
how
soon
could
you
realize
a
million
pounds
a
million
what
he
cried
even
he
was
staggered
by
her
calm
reference
to
this
gigantic
sum
what
on
earth
are
you
driving
at
a
million
pounds
i
said
that
is
to
say
five
million
dollars
how
soon
could
you
realize
as
much
as
that
oh
he
answered
in
about
a
month
if
i
went
about
it
neatly
enough
i
could
unload
as
much
as
that
in
a
month
without
scaring
wall
street
and
other
places
but
it
would
want
some
useless
she
exclaimed
couldn
t
you
do
it
quicker
if
you
really
had
to
if
i
really
had
to
i
could
fix
it
in
a
week
but
it
would
make
things
lively
and
i
should
lose
on
the
couldn
t
you
she
persisted
couldn
t
you
go
down
this
morning
and
raise
a
million
somehow
if
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
he
hesitated
look
here
nella
he
said
what
is
it
you
ve
got
up
your
sleeve
just
answer
my
question
dad
and
try
not
to
think
that
i
m
a
stark
staring
i
rather
expect
i
could
get
a
million
this
morning
even
in
london
but
it
would
cost
pretty
dear
it
might
cost
me
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
there
would
be
the
dickens
of
an
upset
in
new
york
a
sort
of
grand
universal
slump
in
my
why
should
new
york
know
anything
about
it
why
should
new
york
know
anything
about
it
he
repeated
my
girl
when
anyone
borrows
a
million
sovereigns
the
whole
world
knows
about
it
do
you
reckon
that
i
can
go
up
to
the
governors
of
the
bank
of
england
and
say
look
here
lend
theodore
racksole
a
million
for
a
few
weeks
and
he
ll
give
you
an
iou
and
a
covering
note
on
stocks
but
you
could
get
it
she
asked
again
if
there
s
a
million
in
london
i
guess
i
could
handle
it
he
replied
well
dad
and
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
you
ve
just
got
to
go
out
and
fix
it
see
it
s
for
me
i
ve
never
asked
you
for
anything
really
big
before
but
i
do
now
and
i
want
it
so
he
stared
at
her
i
award
you
the
prize
he
said
at
length
you
deserve
it
for
colossal
and
immense
coolness
now
you
can
tell
me
the
true
inward
meaning
of
all
this
rigmarole
what
is
it
i
want
it
for
prince
eugen
she
began
at
first
hesitatingly
with
pauses
he
s
ruined
unless
he
can
get
a
million
to
pay
off
his
debts
he
s
dreadfully
in
love
with
a
princess
and
he
can
t
marry
her
because
of
this
her
parents
wouldn
t
allow
it
he
was
to
have
got
it
from
sampson
levi
but
he
arrived
too
late
owing
to
i
know
all
about
that
perhaps
more
than
you
do
but
i
don
t
see
how
it
affects
you
or
the
point
is
this
dad
nella
continued
he
s
tried
to
commit
suicide
he
s
so
hipped
yes
real
suicide
he
took
laudanum
last
night
it
didn
t
kill
him
straight
off
he
s
got
over
the
first
shock
but
he
s
in
a
very
weak
state
and
he
means
to
die
and
i
truly
believe
he
will
die
now
if
you
could
let
him
have
that
million
dad
you
would
save
his
nella
s
item
of
news
was
a
considerable
and
disconcerting
surprise
to
racksole
but
he
hid
his
feelings
fairly
well
i
haven
t
the
least
desire
to
save
his
life
nell
i
don
t
overmuch
respect
your
prince
eugen
i
ve
done
what
i
could
for
him
but
only
for
the
sake
of
seeing
fair
play
and
because
i
object
to
conspiracies
and
secret
murders
it
s
a
different
thing
if
he
wants
to
kill
himself
what
i
say
is
let
him
who
is
responsible
for
his
being
in
debt
to
the
tune
of
a
million
pounds
he
s
only
got
himself
and
his
bad
habits
to
thank
for
that
i
suppose
if
he
does
happen
to
peg
out
the
throne
of
posen
will
go
to
prince
aribert
and
a
good
thing
too
aribert
is
worth
twenty
of
his
that
s
just
it
dad
she
said
eagerly
following
up
her
chance
i
want
you
to
save
prince
eugen
just
because
aribert
prince
aribert
doesn
t
wish
to
occupy
the
throne
he
d
much
prefer
not
to
have
much
prefer
not
to
have
it
don
t
talk
nonsense
if
he
s
honest
with
himself
he
ll
admit
that
he
ll
be
jolly
glad
to
have
it
thrones
are
in
his
blood
so
to
you
are
wrong
father
and
the
reason
is
this
if
prince
aribert
ascended
the
throne
of
posen
he
would
be
compelled
to
marry
a
well
a
prince
ought
to
marry
a
but
he
doesn
t
want
to
he
wants
to
give
up
all
his
royal
rights
and
live
as
a
subject
he
wants
to
marry
a
woman
who
isn
t
a
is
she
rich
her
father
is
said
the
girl
oh
dad
can
t
you
guess
he
he
loves
her
head
fell
on
theodore
s
shoulder
and
she
began
to
cry
the
millionaire
whistled
a
very
high
note
nell
he
said
at
length
and
you
do
you
sort
of
cling
to
him
dad
she
answered
you
are
stupid
do
you
imagine
i
should
worry
myself
like
this
if
i
didn
t
she
smiled
through
her
tears
she
knew
from
her
father
s
tone
that
she
had
accomplished
a
victory
it
s
a
mighty
queer
arrangement
theodore
remarked
but
of
course
if
you
think
it
ll
be
of
any
use
you
had
better
go
down
and
tell
your
prince
eugen
that
that
million
can
be
fixed
up
if
he
really
needs
it
i
expect
there
ll
be
decent
security
or
sampson
levi
wouldn
t
have
mixed
himself
up
in
thanks
dad
don
t
come
with
me
i
may
manage
better
she
gave
a
formal
little
curtsey
and
disappeared
racksole
who
had
the
talent
so
necessary
to
millionaires
of
attending
to
several
matters
at
once
the
large
with
the
small
went
off
to
give
orders
about
the
breakfast
and
the
remuneration
of
his
assistant
of
the
evening
before
mr
george
hazell
he
then
sent
an
invitation
to
mr
felix
babylon
s
room
asking
that
gentleman
to
take
breakfast
with
him
after
he
had
related
to
babylon
the
history
of
jules
capture
and
had
a
long
discussion
with
him
upon
several
points
of
hotel
management
and
especially
as
to
the
guarding
of
racksole
put
on
his
hat
sallied
forth
into
the
strand
hailed
a
hansom
and
was
driven
to
the
city
the
order
and
nature
of
his
operations
there
were
too
complex
and
technical
to
be
described
here
when
nella
returned
to
the
state
bedroom
both
the
doctor
and
the
great
specialist
were
again
in
attendance
the
two
physicians
moved
away
from
the
bedside
as
she
entered
and
began
to
talk
quietly
together
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
a
curious
case
said
the
specialist
yes
of
course
as
you
say
it
s
a
neurotic
temperament
that
s
at
the
bottom
of
the
trouble
when
you
ve
got
that
and
a
vigorous
constitution
working
one
against
the
other
the
results
are
apt
to
be
distinctly
curious
do
you
consider
there
is
any
hope
sir
charles
if
i
had
seen
him
when
he
recovered
consciousness
i
should
have
said
there
was
hope
frankly
when
i
left
last
night
or
rather
this
morning
i
didn
t
expect
to
see
the
prince
alive
again
let
alone
conscious
and
able
to
talk
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
game
he
ought
to
get
over
the
shock
to
the
system
with
perfect
ease
and
certainty
but
i
don
t
think
he
will
i
don
t
think
he
wants
to
and
moreover
i
think
he
is
still
under
the
influence
of
suicidal
mania
if
he
had
a
razor
he
would
cut
his
throat
you
must
keep
his
strength
up
inject
if
necessary
i
will
come
in
this
afternoon
i
am
due
now
at
st
james
s
and
the
specialist
hurried
away
with
an
elaborate
bow
and
a
few
hasty
words
of
polite
reassurances
to
prince
aribert
when
he
had
gone
prince
aribert
took
the
other
doctor
aside
forget
everything
doctor
he
said
except
that
i
am
one
man
and
you
are
another
and
tell
me
the
truth
shall
you
be
able
to
save
his
highness
tell
me
the
there
is
no
truth
was
the
doctor
s
reply
the
future
is
not
in
our
hands
but
you
are
hopeful
yes
or
the
doctor
looked
at
prince
aribert
no
he
said
shortly
i
am
not
i
am
never
hopeful
when
the
patient
is
not
on
my
you
mean
i
mean
that
his
royal
highness
has
no
desire
to
live
you
must
have
observed
only
too
well
said
aribert
and
you
are
aware
of
the
cause
aribert
nodded
an
affirmative
but
can
not
remove
it
no
said
aribert
he
felt
a
touch
on
his
sleeve
it
was
nella
s
finger
with
a
gesture
she
beckoned
him
towards
the
if
you
choose
she
said
when
they
were
alone
prince
eugen
can
be
saved
i
have
arranged
you
have
arranged
it
he
bent
over
her
almost
with
an
air
of
alarm
go
and
tell
him
that
the
million
pounds
which
is
so
necessary
to
his
happiness
will
be
forthcoming
tell
him
that
it
will
be
forthcoming
today
if
that
will
be
any
satisfaction
to
but
what
do
you
mean
by
this
nella
i
mean
what
i
say
aribert
and
she
sought
his
hand
and
took
it
in
hers
just
what
i
say
if
a
million
pounds
will
save
prince
eugen
s
life
it
is
at
his
but
how
how
have
you
managed
it
by
what
miracle
my
father
she
replied
softly
will
do
anything
that
i
ask
him
do
not
let
us
waste
time
go
and
tell
eugen
it
is
arranged
that
all
will
be
well
go
but
we
can
not
accept
this
this
enormous
this
incredible
favour
it
is
aribert
she
said
quickly
remember
you
are
not
in
posen
holding
a
court
reception
you
are
in
england
and
you
are
talking
to
an
american
girl
who
has
always
been
in
the
habit
of
having
her
own
the
prince
threw
up
his
hands
and
went
back
in
to
the
bedroom
the
doctor
was
at
a
table
writing
out
a
prescription
aribert
approached
the
bedside
his
heart
beating
furiously
eugen
greeted
him
with
a
faint
fatigued
smile
eugen
he
whispered
listen
carefully
to
me
i
have
news
with
the
assistance
of
friends
i
have
arranged
to
borrow
that
million
for
you
it
is
quite
settled
and
you
may
rely
on
it
but
you
must
get
better
do
you
hear
me
eugen
almost
sat
up
in
bed
tell
me
i
am
not
delirious
he
exclaimed
of
course
you
aren
t
aribert
replied
but
you
mustn
t
sit
up
you
must
take
care
of
who
will
lend
the
money
eugen
asked
in
a
feeble
happy
whisper
never
mind
you
shall
hear
later
devote
yourself
now
to
getting
the
change
in
the
patient
s
face
was
extraordinary
his
mind
seemed
to
have
put
on
an
entirely
different
aspect
the
doctor
was
startled
to
hear
him
murmur
a
request
for
food
as
for
aribert
he
sat
down
overcome
by
the
turmoil
of
his
own
thoughts
till
that
moment
he
felt
that
he
had
never
appreciated
the
value
and
the
marvellous
power
of
mere
money
of
the
lucre
which
philosophers
pretend
to
despise
and
men
sell
their
souls
for
his
heart
almost
burst
in
its
admiration
for
that
extraordinary
nella
who
by
mere
personal
force
had
raised
two
men
out
of
the
deepest
slough
of
despair
to
the
blissful
heights
of
hope
and
happiness
these
he
said
to
himself
what
a
race
by
the
afternoon
eugen
was
noticeably
and
distinctly
better
the
physicians
puzzled
for
the
third
time
by
the
progress
of
the
case
announced
now
that
all
danger
was
past
the
tone
of
the
announcement
seemed
to
aribert
to
imply
that
the
fortunate
issue
was
due
wholly
to
unrivalled
medical
skill
but
perhaps
aribert
was
mistaken
anyhow
he
was
in
a
most
charitable
mood
and
prepared
to
forgive
anything
nella
he
said
a
little
later
when
they
were
by
themselves
again
in
the
what
am
i
to
say
to
you
how
can
i
thank
you
how
can
i
thank
your
father
you
had
better
not
thank
my
father
she
said
dad
will
affect
to
regard
the
thing
as
a
purely
business
transaction
as
of
course
it
is
as
for
me
you
can
you
can
well
kiss
me
she
said
there
are
you
sure
you
ve
formally
proposed
to
me
mon
prince
ah
nell
he
exclaimed
putting
his
arms
round
her
again
be
mine
that
is
all
i
want
you
ll
find
she
said
that
you
ll
want
dad
s
consent
too
will
he
make
difficulties
he
could
not
nell
not
with
you
better
ask
him
she
said
sweetly
a
moment
later
racksole
himself
entered
the
room
going
on
all
right
he
enquired
pointing
to
the
bedroom
excellently
the
lovers
answered
together
and
they
both
blushed
ah
said
racksole
then
if
that
s
so
and
you
can
spare
a
minute
i
ve
something
to
show
you
chapter
thirty
conclusion
i
ve
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
prince
racksole
began
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
room
and
also
as
i
said
something
to
show
you
will
you
come
to
my
room
we
will
talk
there
first
the
whole
hotel
is
humming
with
with
pleasure
said
aribert
glad
his
highness
prince
eugen
is
recovering
racksole
said
urged
by
considerations
of
politeness
ah
as
to
that
aribert
began
if
you
don
t
mind
we
ll
discuss
that
later
prince
racksole
interrupted
him
they
were
in
the
proprietor
s
private
room
i
want
to
tell
you
all
about
last
night
racksole
resumed
about
my
capture
of
jules
and
my
examination
of
him
this
and
he
launched
into
a
full
account
of
the
whole
thing
down
to
the
least
details
you
see
he
concluded
that
our
suspicions
as
to
bosnia
were
tolerably
correct
but
as
regards
bosnia
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
surer
i
feel
that
nothing
can
be
done
to
bring
their
criminal
politicians
to
and
as
to
jules
what
do
you
propose
to
do
come
this
way
said
racksole
and
led
aribert
to
another
room
a
sofa
in
this
room
was
covered
with
a
linen
cloth
racksole
lifted
the
cloth
he
could
never
deny
himself
a
dramatic
moment
and
disclosed
the
body
of
a
dead
man
it
was
jules
dead
but
without
a
scratch
or
mark
on
him
i
have
sent
for
the
police
not
a
street
constable
but
an
official
from
scotland
yard
said
racksole
how
did
this
happen
aribert
asked
amazed
and
startled
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
was
safely
immured
in
the
so
he
was
racksole
replied
i
went
up
there
this
afternoon
chiefly
to
take
him
some
food
the
commissionaire
was
on
guard
at
the
door
he
had
heard
no
noise
nothing
unusual
yet
when
i
entered
the
room
jules
was
gone
he
had
by
some
means
or
other
loosened
his
fastenings
he
had
then
managed
to
take
the
door
off
the
wardrobe
he
had
moved
the
bed
in
front
of
the
window
and
by
pushing
the
wardrobe
door
three
parts
out
of
the
window
and
lodging
the
inside
end
of
it
under
the
rail
at
the
head
of
the
bed
he
had
provided
himself
with
a
sort
of
insecure
platform
outside
the
window
all
this
he
did
without
making
the
least
sound
he
must
then
have
got
through
the
window
and
stood
on
the
little
platform
with
his
fingers
he
would
just
be
able
to
reach
the
outer
edge
of
the
wide
cornice
under
the
roof
of
the
hotel
by
main
strength
of
arms
he
had
swung
himself
on
to
this
cornice
and
so
got
on
to
the
roof
proper
he
would
then
have
the
run
of
the
whole
roof
at
the
side
of
the
building
facing
salisbury
lane
there
is
an
iron
escape
which
runs
right
down
from
the
ridge
of
the
roof
into
a
little
sunk
yard
level
with
the
cellars
jules
must
have
thought
that
his
escape
was
accomplished
but
it
unfortunately
happened
that
one
rung
in
the
iron
had
rusted
rotten
through
being
badly
painted
it
gave
way
and
jules
not
expecting
anything
of
the
kind
fell
to
the
ground
that
was
the
end
of
all
his
cleverness
and
as
racksole
ceased
speaking
he
replaced
the
linen
cloth
with
a
gesture
from
which
reverence
was
not
wholly
absent
when
the
grave
had
closed
over
the
dark
and
tempestuous
career
of
tom
jackson
once
the
pride
of
the
grand
babylon
there
was
little
trouble
for
the
people
whose
adventures
we
have
described
miss
spencer
that
faithful
slave
and
attendant
of
a
brilliant
scoundrel
was
never
heard
of
again
possibly
to
this
day
she
survives
a
mystery
to
her
in
the
pension
of
some
cheap
foreign
house
as
for
rocco
he
certainly
was
heard
of
again
several
years
after
the
events
set
down
it
came
to
the
knowledge
of
felix
babylon
that
the
unrivalled
rocco
had
reached
buenos
aires
and
by
his
culinary
skill
was
there
making
the
fortune
of
a
new
and
splendid
hotel
babylon
transmitted
the
information
to
theodore
racksole
and
racksole
might
had
he
chosen
have
put
the
forces
of
the
law
in
motion
against
him
but
racksole
seeing
that
everything
pointed
to
the
fact
that
rocco
was
now
pursuing
his
vocation
honestly
decided
to
leave
him
alone
the
one
difficulty
which
racksole
experienced
after
the
demise
of
jules
and
it
was
a
difficulty
which
he
had
of
course
anticipated
was
connected
with
the
police
the
police
very
properly
wanted
to
know
things
they
desired
to
be
informed
what
racksole
had
been
doing
in
the
dimmock
affair
between
his
first
visit
to
ostend
and
his
sending
for
them
to
take
charge
of
jules
dead
body
and
racksole
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
tell
them
everything
beyond
question
he
had
transgressed
the
laws
of
england
and
possibly
also
the
laws
of
belgium
and
the
moral
excellence
of
his
motives
in
doing
so
was
of
course
in
the
eyes
of
legal
justice
no
excuse
for
such
conduct
the
inquest
upon
jules
aroused
some
bother
and
about
separate
and
distinct
rumours
in
the
end
however
a
compromise
was
arrived
at
racksole
s
first
aim
was
to
pacify
the
inspector
whose
clue
which
by
the
way
was
a
false
one
he
had
so
curtly
declined
to
follow
up
that
done
the
rest
needed
only
tact
and
patience
he
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
authorities
that
he
had
acted
in
a
perfectly
honest
spirit
though
with
a
high
hand
and
that
substantial
justice
had
been
done
also
he
subtly
indicated
that
if
it
came
to
the
point
he
should
defy
them
to
do
their
worst
lastly
he
was
able
through
the
medium
of
the
united
states
ambassador
to
bring
certain
soothing
influences
to
bear
upon
the
situation
one
afternoon
a
fortnight
after
the
recovery
of
the
hereditary
prince
of
posen
aribert
who
was
still
staying
at
the
grand
babylon
expressed
a
wish
to
hold
converse
with
the
millionaire
prince
eugen
accompanied
by
hans
and
some
court
officials
whom
he
had
sent
for
had
departed
with
immense
éclat
armed
with
the
comfortable
million
to
arrange
formally
for
his
betrothal
touching
the
million
eugen
had
given
satisfactory
personal
security
and
the
money
was
to
be
paid
off
in
fifteen
years
you
wish
to
talk
to
me
prince
said
racksole
to
aribert
when
they
were
seated
together
in
the
former
s
room
i
wish
to
tell
you
replied
aribert
that
it
is
my
intention
to
renounce
all
my
rights
and
titles
as
a
royal
prince
of
posen
and
to
be
known
in
future
as
count
hartz
a
rank
to
which
i
am
entitled
through
my
mother
also
that
i
have
a
private
income
of
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
a
château
and
a
town
house
in
posen
i
tell
you
this
because
i
am
here
to
ask
the
hand
of
your
daughter
in
marriage
i
love
her
and
i
am
vain
enough
to
believe
that
she
loves
me
i
have
already
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
she
has
consented
we
await
your
you
honour
us
prince
said
racksole
with
a
slight
smile
and
in
more
ways
than
one
may
i
ask
your
reason
for
renouncing
your
princely
titles
simply
because
the
idea
of
a
morganatic
marriage
would
be
as
repugnant
to
me
as
it
would
be
to
yourself
and
to
that
is
the
prince
laughed
i
suppose
it
has
occurred
to
you
that
ten
thousand
pounds
per
annum
for
a
man
in
your
position
is
a
somewhat
small
income
nella
is
frightfully
extravagant
i
have
known
her
to
spend
sixty
thousand
dollars
in
a
single
year
and
have
nothing
to
show
for
it
at
the
end
why
she
would
ruin
you
in
twelve
nella
must
reform
her
ways
aribert
said
if
she
is
content
to
do
so
racksole
went
on
well
and
good
i
in
her
name
and
my
own
i
thank
you
said
aribert
gravely
and
the
millionaire
continued
so
that
she
may
not
have
to
reform
too
fiercely
i
shall
settle
on
her
absolutely
with
reversion
to
your
children
if
you
have
any
a
lump
sum
of
fifty
million
dollars
that
is
to
say
ten
million
pounds
in
sound
selected
railway
stock
i
reckon
that
is
about
half
my
fortune
nella
and
i
have
always
shared
aribert
made
no
reply
the
two
men
shook
hands
in
silence
and
then
it
happened
that
nella
entered
the
room
that
night
after
dinner
racksole
and
his
friend
felix
babylon
were
walking
together
on
the
terrace
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
felix
had
begun
the
conversation
i
suppose
racksole
he
had
said
you
aren
t
getting
tired
of
the
grand
babylon
why
do
you
ask
because
i
am
getting
tired
of
doing
without
it
a
thousand
times
since
i
sold
it
to
you
i
have
wished
i
could
undo
the
bargain
i
can
t
bear
idleness
will
you
sell
i
might
said
racksole
i
might
be
induced
to
what
will
you
take
my
friend
asked
felix
what
i
gave
was
the
quick
answer
eh
felix
exclaimed
i
sell
you
my
hotel
with
jules
with
rocco
with
miss
spencer
you
go
and
lose
all
those
three
inestimable
servants
and
then
offer
me
the
hotel
without
them
at
the
same
price
it
is
the
little
man
laughed
heartily
at
his
own
wit
nevertheless
he
added
we
will
not
quarrel
about
the
price
i
accept
your
and
so
was
brought
to
a
close
the
complex
chain
of
events
which
had
begun
when
theodore
racksole
ordered
a
steak
and
a
bottle
of
bass
at
the
table
d
hôte
of
the
grand
babylon
hôtel
