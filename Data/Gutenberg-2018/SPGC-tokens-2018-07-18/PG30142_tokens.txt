introduction
i
wrote
little
brother
in
a
fury
between
may
and
july
exactly
eight
weeks
from
the
day
i
thought
it
up
to
the
day
i
finished
it
alice
to
whom
this
book
is
dedicated
had
to
put
up
with
me
clacking
out
the
final
chapter
at
in
our
hotel
in
rome
where
we
were
celebrating
our
anniversary
i
always
dreamed
of
having
a
book
just
materialize
fully
formed
and
come
pouring
out
of
my
fingertips
no
sweat
and
fuss
but
it
was
nearly
as
much
fun
as
i
thought
it
would
be
there
were
days
when
i
wrote
words
hunching
over
my
keyboard
in
airports
on
subways
in
taxis
anywhere
i
could
type
the
book
was
trying
to
get
out
of
my
head
no
matter
what
and
i
missed
so
much
sleep
and
so
many
meals
that
friends
started
to
ask
if
i
was
unwell
when
my
dad
was
a
young
university
student
in
the
he
was
one
of
the
few
counterculture
people
who
thought
computers
were
a
good
thing
for
most
young
people
computers
represented
the
of
society
university
students
were
reduced
to
numbers
on
a
punchcard
each
bearing
the
legend
do
not
bend
spindle
fold
or
mutilate
prompting
some
of
the
students
to
wear
pins
that
said
i
am
a
student
do
not
bend
spindle
fold
or
mutilate
me
computers
were
seen
as
a
means
to
increase
the
ability
of
the
authorities
to
regiment
people
and
bend
them
to
their
will
when
i
was
a
the
world
seemed
like
it
was
just
going
to
get
more
free
the
berlin
wall
was
about
to
come
down
computers
which
had
been
geeky
and
weird
a
few
years
before
were
everywhere
and
the
modem
i
used
to
connect
to
local
bulletin
board
systems
was
now
connecting
me
to
the
entire
world
through
the
internet
and
commercial
online
services
like
genie
my
lifelong
fascination
with
activist
causes
went
into
overdrive
as
i
saw
how
the
main
difficulty
in
activism
organizing
was
getting
easier
by
leaps
and
bounds
i
still
remember
the
first
time
i
switched
from
mailing
out
a
newsletter
with
addresses
to
using
a
database
with
in
the
soviet
union
communications
tools
were
being
used
to
bring
information
and
revolution
to
the
corners
of
the
largest
authoritarian
state
the
earth
had
ever
seen
but
years
later
things
are
very
different
the
computers
i
love
are
being
used
to
spy
on
us
control
us
snitch
on
us
the
national
security
agency
has
illegally
wiretapped
the
entire
usa
and
gotten
away
with
it
car
rental
companies
and
mass
transit
and
traffic
authorities
are
watching
where
we
go
sending
us
automated
tickets
finking
us
out
to
busybodies
cops
and
bad
guys
who
gain
illicit
access
to
their
databases
the
transport
security
administration
maintains
a
list
of
people
who
never
been
convicted
of
any
crime
but
who
are
nevertheless
considered
too
dangerous
to
fly
the
list
contents
are
secret
the
rule
that
makes
it
enforceable
is
secret
the
criteria
for
being
added
to
the
list
are
secret
it
has
on
it
and
us
senators
and
decorated
veterans
actual
war
heroes
the
year
olds
i
know
understand
to
a
nicety
just
how
dangerous
a
computer
can
be
the
authoritarian
nightmare
of
the
has
come
home
for
them
the
seductive
little
boxes
on
their
desks
and
in
their
pockets
watch
their
every
move
corral
them
in
systematically
depriving
them
of
those
new
freedoms
i
had
enjoyed
and
made
such
good
use
of
in
my
young
adulthood
what
more
kids
were
clearly
being
used
as
for
a
new
kind
of
technological
state
that
all
of
us
were
on
our
way
to
a
world
where
taking
a
picture
was
either
piracy
in
a
movie
theater
or
museum
or
even
a
starbucks
or
terrorism
in
a
public
place
but
where
we
could
be
photographed
tracked
and
logged
hundreds
of
times
a
day
by
every
dictator
cop
bureaucrat
and
a
world
where
any
measure
including
torture
could
be
justified
just
by
waving
your
hands
and
shouting
terrorism
terrorism
until
all
dissent
fell
silent
we
do
have
to
go
down
that
road
if
you
love
freedom
if
you
think
the
human
condition
is
dignified
by
privacy
by
the
right
to
be
left
alone
by
the
right
to
explore
your
weird
ideas
provided
you
do
hurt
others
then
you
have
common
cause
with
the
kids
whose
and
cell
phones
are
being
used
to
lock
them
up
and
follow
them
around
if
you
believe
that
the
answer
to
bad
speech
is
more
speech
not
censorship
then
you
have
a
dog
in
the
fight
if
you
believe
in
a
society
of
laws
a
land
where
our
rulers
have
to
tell
us
the
rules
and
have
to
follow
them
too
then
you
part
of
the
same
struggle
that
kids
fight
when
they
argue
for
the
right
to
live
under
the
same
bill
of
rights
that
adults
have
this
book
is
meant
to
be
part
of
the
conversation
about
what
an
information
society
means
does
it
mean
total
control
or
liberty

not
just
a
noun
it
a
verb
it
something

family
you
can
use
those
ideas
to
defeat
censorship
and
get
onto
the
free
internet
even
if
your
government
employer
or
school
does
want
you
to
making
stuff
the
folks
at
instructables
have
put
up
some
killer
howtos
for
building

technology

of

great
britain
i
a
canadian
and
i
lived
in
lots
of
places
including
san
francisco
the
setting
for
little
brother
and
now
i
live
in
london
england
with
my
wife
alice
and
our
little
daughter
poesy
i
lived
here
off
and
on
for
five
years
now
and
though
i
love
it
to
tiny
pieces
there
one
thing
that
always
bugged
me
my
books
are
available
here
some
stores
carried
them
as
special
items
imported
from
the
usa
but
it
was
published
by
a
british
publisher
that
changed
harpercollins
uk
has
bought
the
british
rights
to
this
book
along
with
my
next
young
adult
novel
for
the
win
and
they
publishing
it
just
a
few
months
after
the
us
edition
on
november
the
day
after
i
get
back
from
my
honeymoon
update
november
and
it
on
shelves
now
the
harpercollins
edition
a
knockout
too
i
so
glad
about
this
i
could
bust
honestly
not
just
because
they
finally
selling
my
books
in
my
adopted
homeland
but
because
raising
a
daughter
here
and
the
surveillance
and
control
mania
in
this
country
is
starting
to
scare
me
bloodless
it
seems
like
the
entire
police
and
governance
system
in
britain
has
fallen
in
love
with
fingerprinting
and
everyone
on
the
off
chance
that
someday
you
might
do
something
wrong
in
early
the
head
of
scotland
yard
seriously
proposed
taking
dna
from
who
display
offending
traits
because
they
probably
grow
up
to
be
criminals
the
next
week
the
london
police
put
up
posters
asking
us
all
to
turn
in
people
who
seem
to
be
taking
pictures
of
the
ubiquitous
cctv
because
anyone
who
pays
too
much
attention
to
the
surveillance
machine
is
probably
a
terrorist
america
is
the
only
country
that
lost
its
mind
this
decade
britain
right
there
in
the
nuthouse
with
it
dribbling
down
its
shirt
front
and
pointing
its
finger
at
the
invisible
bogeymen
and
screaming
until
it
gets
its
meds

the
copyright
thing
the
creative
commons
license
at
the
top
of
this
file
probably
tipped
you
off
to
the
fact
that
i
got
some
pretty
unorthodox
views
about
copyright
here
what
i
think
of
it
in
a
nutshell
a
little
goes
a
long
way
and
more
than
that
is
too
much
i
like
the
fact
that
copyright
lets
me
sell
rights
to
my
publishers
and
film
studios
and
so
on
it
nice
that
they
ca
just
take
my
stuff
without
permission
and
get
rich
on
it
without
cutting
me
in
for
a
piece
of
the
action
i
in
a
pretty
good
position
when
it
comes
to
negotiating
with
these
companies
i
got
a
great
agent
and
a
decade
experience
with
copyright
law
and
licensing
including
a
stint
as
a
delegate
at
wipo
the
un
agency
that
makes
the
world
copyright
treaties
what
more
there
just
not
that
many
of
these
negotiations
even
if
i
sell
fifty
or
a
hundred
different
editions
of
little
brother
which
would
put
it
in
top
millionth
of
a
percentile
for
fiction
that
still
only
a
hundred
negotiations
which
i
could
just
about
manage
i
the
fact
that
fans
who
want
to
do
what
readers
have
always
done
are
expected
to
play
in
the
same
system
as
all
these
hotshot
agents
and
lawyers
it
just
to
say
that
an
elementary
school
classroom
should
have
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
at
a
giant
global
publisher
before
they
put
on
a
play
based
on
one
of
my
books
it
ridiculous
to
say
that
people
who
want
to
loan
their
electronic
copy
of
my
book
to
a
friend
need
to
get
a
to
do
so
loaning
books
has
been
around
longer
than
any
publisher
on
earth
and
it
a
fine
thing
i
recently
saw
neil
gaiman
give
a
talk
at
which
someone
asked
him
how
he
felt
about
piracy
of
his
books
he
said
hands
up
in
the
audience
if
you
discovered
your
favorite
writer
for
free
because
someone
loaned
you
a
copy
or
because
someone
gave
it
to
you
now
hands
up
if
you
found
your
favorite
writer
by
walking
into
a
store
and
plunking
down
cash
overwhelmingly
the
audience
said
that
they
discovered
their
favorite
writers
for
free
on
a
loan
or
as
a
gift
when
it
comes
to
my
favorite
writers
there
no
boundaries
i
buy
every
book
they
publish
just
to
own
it
sometimes
i
buy
two
or
three
to
give
away
to
friends
who
read
those
books
i
pay
to
see
them
live
i
buy
with
their
on
them
i
a
customer
for
life
neil
went
on
to
say
that
he
was
part
of
the
tribe
of
readers
the
tiny
minority
of
people
in
the
world
who
read
for
pleasure
buying
books
because
they
love
them
one
thing
he
knows
about
everyone
who
downloads
his
books
on
the
internet
without
permission
is
that
they
they
people
who
love
books
people
who
study
the
habits
of
have
discovered
something
curious
the
biggest
pirates
are
also
the
biggest
spenders
if
you
pirate
music
all
night
long
chances
are
you
one
of
the
few
people
left
who
also
goes
to
the
record
store
remember
those
during
the
day
you
probably
go
to
concerts
on
the
weekend
and
you
probably
check
music
out
of
the
library
too
if
you
a
member
of
the
tribe
you
do
lots
of
that
has
to
do
with
music
from
singing
in
the
shower
to
paying
for
vinyl
bootlegs
of
rare
eastern
european
covers
of
your
favorite
band
same
with
books
i
worked
in
new
bookstores
used
bookstores
and
libraries
i
hung
out
in
pirate
ebook
bookwarez
places
online
i
a
stone
used
bookstore
junkie
and
i
go
to
book
fairs
for
fun
and
you
know
what
it
the
same
people
at
all
those
places
book
fans
who
do
lots
of
everything
that
has
to
do
with
books
i
buy
weird
fugly
pirate
editions
of
my
favorite
books
in
china
because
they
weird
and
fugly
and
look
great
next
to
the
eight
or
nine
other
editions
that
i
paid
for
of
the
same
books
i
check
books
out
of
the
library
google
them
when
i
need
a
quote
carry
dozens
around
on
my
phone
and
hundreds
on
my
laptop
and
have
at
this
writing
more
than
of
them
in
storage
lockers
in
london
los
angeles
and
toronto
if
i
could
loan
out
my
physical
books
without
giving
up
possession
of
them
i
the
fact
that
i
can
do
so
with
digital
files
is
not
a
bug
it
a
feature
and
a
damned
fine
one
it
embarrassing
to
see
all
these
writers
and
musicians
and
artists
bemoaning
the
fact
that
art
just
got
this
wicked
new
feature
the
ability
to
be
shared
without
losing
access
to
it
in
the
first
place
it
like
watching
restaurant
owners
crying
down
their
shirts
about
the
new
free
lunch
machine
that
feeding
the
world
starving
people
because
it
force
them
to
reconsider
their
yes
that
gon
na
be
tricky
but
let
not
lose
sight
of
the
main
attraction
free
lunches
universal
access
to
human
knowledge
is
in
our
grasp
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
case
that
not
enough
for
you
here
my
pitch
on
why
giving
away
ebooks
makes
sense
at
this
time
and
place
giving
away
ebooks
gives
me
artistic
moral
and
commercial
satisfaction
the
commercial
question
is
the
one
that
comes
up
most
often
how
can
you
give
away
free
ebooks
and
still
make
money
for
me
for
pretty
much
every
writer
the
big
problem
is
piracy
it
obscurity
thanks
to
tim
for
this
great
aphorism
of
all
the
people
who
failed
to
buy
this
book
today
the
majority
did
so
because
they
never
heard
of
it
not
because
someone
gave
them
a
free
copy
in
science
fiction
sell
half
a
million
copies
in
a
world
where
attend
the
san
diego
comic
con
alone
you
got
to
figure
that
most
of
the
people
who
like
science
fiction
and
related
geeky
stuff
like
comics
games
linux
and
so
on
just
do
really
buy
books
i
more
interested
in
getting
more
of
that
wider
audience
into
the
tent
than
making
sure
that
everyone
who
in
the
tent
bought
a
ticket
to
be
there
ebooks
are
verbs
not
nouns
you
copy
them
it
in
their
nature
and
many
of
those
copies
have
a
destination
a
person
they
intended
for
a
transfer
from
one
person
to
another
embodying
a
personal
recommendation
between
two
people
who
trust
each
other
enough
to
share
bits
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
authors
should
dream
of
the
proverbial
sealing
of
the
deal
by
making
my
books
available
for
free
i
make
it
easy
for
people
who
love
them
to
help
other
people
love
them
what
more
i
do
see
ebooks
as
substitute
for
paper
books
for
most
people
it
not
that
the
screens
are
good
enough
either
if
you
anything
like
me
you
already
spend
every
hour
you
can
get
in
front
of
the
screen
reading
text
but
the
more
you
are
the
less
likely
you
are
to
be
reading
works
on
those
screens
that
because
people
do
more
things
with
their
computers
we
run
im
and
email
and
we
use
the
browser
in
a
million
diverse
ways
we
have
games
running
in
the
background
and
endless
opportunities
to
tinker
with
our
music
libraries
the
more
you
do
with
your
computer
the
more
likely
it
is
that
you
be
interrupted
after
five
to
seven
minutes
to
do
something
else
that
makes
the
computer
extremely
poorly
suited
to
reading
works
off
of
unless
you
have
the
iron
of
a
monk
the
good
news
for
writers
is
that
this
means
that
ebooks
on
computers
are
more
likely
to
be
an
enticement
to
buy
the
printed
book
which
is
after
all
cheap
easily
had
and
easy
to
use
than
a
substitute
for
it
you
can
probably
read
just
enough
of
the
book
off
the
screen
to
realize
you
want
to
be
reading
it
on
paper
so
ebooks
sell
print
books
every
writer
i
heard
of
who
tried
giving
away
ebooks
to
promote
paper
books
has
come
back
to
do
it
again
that
the
commercial
case
for
doing
free
ebooks
now
onto
the
artistic
case
it
the
century
copying
stuff
is
never
ever
going
to
get
any
harder
than
it
is
today
or
if
it
does
it
be
because
civilization
has
collapsed
at
which
point
we
have
other
problems
hard
drives
are
going
to
get
bulkier
more
expensive
or
less
capacious
networks
wo
get
slower
or
harder
to
access
if
you
not
making
art
with
the
intention
of
having
it
copied
you
not
really
making
art
for
the
century
there
something
charming
about
making
work
you
do
want
to
be
copied
in
the
same
way
that
it
nice
to
go
to
a
pioneer
village
and
see
the
blacksmith
shoeing
a
horse
at
his
traditional
forge
but
it
hardly
you
know
i
a
science
fiction
writer
it
my
job
to
write
about
the
future
on
a
good
day
or
at
least
the
present
art
that
not
supposed
to
be
copied
is
from
the
past
finally
let
look
at
the
moral
case
copying
stuff
is
natural
it
how
we
learn
copying
our
parents
and
the
people
around
us
my
first
story
written
when
i
was
six
was
an
excited
of
star
wars
which
i
just
seen
in
the
theater
now
that
the
internet
the
world
most
efficient
copying
machine
is
pretty
much
everywhere
our
copying
instinct
is
just
going
to
play
out
more
and
more
there
no
way
i
can
stop
my
readers
and
if
i
tried
i
be
a
hypocrite
when
i
was
i
was
making
photocopying
stories
and
generally
copying
in
every
way
i
could
imagine
if
the
internet
had
been
around
then
i
have
been
using
it
to
copy
as
much
as
i
possibly
could
there
no
way
to
stop
it
and
the
people
who
try
end
up
doing
more
harm
than
piracy
ever
did
the
record
industry
ridiculous
holy
war
against
more
than
music
fans
sued
and
counting
exemplifies
the
absurdity
of
trying
to
get
the
out
of
the
swimming
pool
if
the
choice
is
between
allowing
copying
or
being
a
frothing
bully
lashing
out
at
anything
he
can
reach
i
choose
the
former
donations
and
a
word
to
teachers
and
librarians
every
time
i
put
a
book
online
for
free
i
get
emails
from
readers
who
want
to
send
me
donations
for
the
book
i
appreciate
their
generous
spirit
but
i
not
interested
in
cash
donations
because
my
publishers
are
really
important
to
me
they
contribute
immeasurably
to
the
book
improving
it
introducing
it
to
audience
i
could
never
reach
helping
me
do
more
with
my
work
i
have
no
desire
to
cut
them
out
of
the
loop
but
there
has
to
be
some
good
way
to
turn
that
generosity
to
good
use
and
i
think
i
found
it
here
the
deal
there
are
lots
of
teachers
and
librarians
who
love
to
get
of
this
book
into
their
kids
hands
but
do
have
the
budget
for
it
teachers
in
the
us
spend
around
out
of
pocket
each
on
classroom
supplies
that
their
budgets
wo
stretch
to
cover
which
is
why
i
sponsor
a
classroom
at
ivanhoe
elementary
in
my
old
neighborhood
in
los
angeles
you
can
adopt
a
class
yourself
here
http
there
are
generous
people
who
want
to
send
some
cash
my
way
to
thank
me
for
the
free
ebooks
i
proposing
that
we
put
them
together
if
you
a
teacher
or
librarian
and
you
want
a
free

of
little

freelittlebrother

your

and
the

http
by
my
fantastic

olga
nunes
so
that
potential

the
electronic
edition
of
little

and
you
want
to
donate
something
to
say
thanks
go
to

and
find
a
teacher
or
librarian
you
want
to
support
then
go
to
amazon
or
your

electronic
bookseller

to
the
classroom

the
receipt
feel
free
to
delete
your
address
and
other
personal
info
first
to
freelittlebrother
so
that
olga
can
mark
that
copy
as
sent
if
you
do
want
to
be
publicly
acknowledged
for
your
generosity
let
us
know
and
we
keep
you
anonymous
otherwise
we
thank
you
on
the
donate
page
i
have
no
idea
if
this
will
end
up
with
hundreds
dozens
or
just
a
few
copies
going
out
but
i
have
high
hopes
dedication
for
alice
who
makes
me
whole
quotes
a
rousing
tale
of
rebellion
as
necessary
and
dangerous
as

scott
westerfeld
author
of
uglies
and
extras
i
can
talk
about
little
brother
in
terms
of
its
bravura
political
speculation
or
its
brilliant
uses
of
technology
each
of
which
make
this
book
a
but
at
the
end
of
it
all
i
haunted
by
the
universality
of
marcus
and
struggle
an
experience
any
teen
today
is
going
to
grasp
the
moment
when
you
choose
what
your
life
will
mean
and
how
to
achieve
it
steven
c
gould
author
of
jumper
and
reflex
i
recommend
little
brother
over
pretty
much
any
book
i
read
this
year
and
i
want
to
get
it
into
the
hands
of
as
many
smart
year
olds
male
and
female
as
i
can
because
i
think
it
change
lives
because
some
kids
maybe
just
a
few
wo
be
the
same
after
they
read
it
maybe
they
change
politically
maybe
technologically
maybe
it
just
be
the
first
book
they
loved
or
that
spoke
to
their
inner
geek
maybe
they
want
to
argue
about
it
and
disagree
with
it
maybe
they
want
to
open
their
computer
and
see
what
in
there
i
do
know
it
made
me
want
to
be
again
right
now
and
reading
it
for
the
first
time
and
then
go
out
and
make
the
world
better
or
stranger
or
odder
it
a
wonderful
important
book
in
a
way
that
renders
its
flaws
pretty
much
meaningless

not

coincidentally
cory

best
novel

john

war
it
about
growing
up

where
things
have
kept
going
on
the
way
they
been
going
and
it
about
hacking
as
a
habit
of
mind
but
mostly
it
about
growing
up
and
changing
and
looking
at
the
world
and
asking
what

can
do

brian
k
vaughn
author
of
y
the
last
man
little
brother
sounds
an
optimistic
warning
it
extrapolates
from
current
events
to
remind
us
of
the
threats
to
liberty
but
it
also
notes
that
liberty
ultimately
resides
in
our
individual
attitudes
and
actions
in
our
increasingly
authoritarian
world
i
especially
hope
that
teenagers
and
young
adults
will
read
it
and
then
persuade
their
peers
parents
and
teachers
to
follow
suit

about
the
bookstore
dedications
every
chapter
of
this
file
has
been
dedicated
to
a
different
bookstore
and
in
each
case
it
a
store
that
i
love
a
store
that
helped
me
discover
books
that
opened
my
mind
a
store
that
helped
my
career
along
the
stores
did
pay
me
anything
for
this
i
have
even
told
them
about
it
but
it
seems
like
the
right
thing
to
do
after
all
i
hoping
that
you
read
this
ebook
and
decide
to
buy
the
paper
book
so
it
only
makes
sense
to
suggest
a
few
places
you
can
pick
it
up
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
bakkaphoenix
books
in
toronto
canada
bakka
is
the
oldest
science
fiction
bookstore
in
the
world
and
it
made
me
the
mutant
i
am
today
i
wandered
in
for
the
first
time
around
the
age
of
and
asked
for
some
recommendations
tanya
huff
yes
tanya
huff
but
she
was
a
famous
writer
back
then
took
me
back
into
the
used
section
and
pressed
a
copy
of
beam
piper
little
fuzzy
into
my
hands
and
changed
my
life
forever
by
the
time
i
was
i
was
working
at
bakka
i
took
over
from
tanya
when
she
retired
to
write
full
time
and
i
learned
lessons
about
how
and
why
people
buy
books
i
think
every
writer
should
work
at
a
bookstore
and
plenty
of
writers
have
worked
at
bakka
over
the
years
for
the
anniversary
of
the
store
they
put
together
an
anthology
of
stories
by
bakka

included

i
a
senior
at
cesar
chavez
high
in
san
francisco
sunny
mission
district
and
that
makes
me
one
of
the
most
surveilled
people
in
the
world
my
name
is
marcus
yallow
but
back
when
this
story
starts
i
was
going
by
pronounced
winston
pronounced
unless
you
a
clueless
disciplinary
officer
who
far
enough
behind
the
curve
that
you
still
call
the
internet
the
information
superhighway
i
know
just
such
a
clueless
person
and
his
name
is
fred
benson
one
of
three
at
cesar
chavez
he
a
sucking
chest
wound
of
a
human
being
but
if
you
going
to
have
a
jailer
better
a
clueless
one
than
one
who
really
on
the
ball
marcus
yallow
he
said
over
the
pa
one
friday
morning
the
pa
is
very
good
to
begin
with
and
when
you
combine
that
with
benson
habitual
mumble
you
get
something
that
sounds
more
like
someone
struggling
to
digest
a
bad
burrito
than
a
school
announcement
but
human
beings
are
good
at
picking
their
names
out
of
audio
confusion
it
a
survival
trait
i
grabbed
my
bag
and
folded
my
laptop
shut
i
did
want
to
blow
my
downloads
and
got
ready
for
the
inevitable
report
to
the
administration
office
immediately
my
social
studies
teacher
ms
galvez
rolled
her
eyes
at
me
and
i
rolled
my
eyes
back
at
her
the
man
was
always
coming
down
on
me
just
because
i
go
through
school
firewalls
like
wet
kleenex
spoof
the
software
and
nuke
the
snitch
chips
they
track
us
with
galvez
is
a
good
type
anyway
never
holds
that
against
me
especially
when
i
helping
get
with
her
webmail
so
she
can
talk
to
her
brother
who
stationed
in
iraq
my
boy
darryl
gave
me
a
smack
on
the
ass
as
i
walked
past
i
known
darryl
since
we
were
still
in
diapers
and
escaping
from
and
i
been
getting
him
into
and
out
of
trouble
the
whole
time
i
raised
my
arms
over
my
head
like
a
prizefighter
and
made
my
exit
from
social
studies
and
began
the
to
the
office
i
was
halfway
there
when
my
phone
went
that
was
another
phones
are
muy
prohibido
at
chavez
high
but
why
should
that
stop
me
i
ducked
into
the
toilet
and
shut
myself
in
the
middle
stall
the
furthest
stall
is
always
grossest
because
so
many
people
head
straight
for
it
hoping
to
escape
the
smell
and
the
squick
the
smart
money
and
good
hygiene
is
down
the
middle
i
checked
the
phone
my
home
pc
had
sent
it
an
email
to
tell
it
that
there
was
something
new
up
on
harajuku
fun
madness
which
happens
to
be
the
best
game
ever
invented
i
grinned
spending
fridays
at
school
was
teh
suck
anyway
and
i
was
glad
of
the
excuse
to
make
my
escape
i
ambled
the
rest
of
the
way
to
benson
office
and
tossed
him
a
wave
as
i
sailed
through
the
door
if
it
is
he
said
fredrick
benson
social
security
number
date
of
birth
august
mother
maiden
name
di
bona
hometown
petaluma
is
a
lot
taller
than
me
i
a
runty
while
he
stands
and
his
college
basketball
days
are
far
enough
behind
him
that
his
chest
muscles
have
turned
into
saggy
that
were
painfully
obvious
through
his
freebie
he
always
looks
like
he
about
to
your
ass
and
he
really
into
raising
his
voice
for
dramatic
effect
both
these
start
to
lose
their
efficacy
with
repeated
application
sorry
nope
i
said
i
never
heard
of
this
character
of
yours
he
said
spelling
it
out
again
he
gave
me
a
hairy
eyeball
and
waited
for
me
to
wilt
of
course
it
was
my
handle
and
had
been
for
years
it
was
the
identity
i
used
when
i
was
posting
on
where
i
was
making
my
contributions
to
the
field
of
applied
security
research
you
know
like
sneaking
out
of
school
and
disabling
the
on
my
phone
but
he
did
know
that
this
was
my
handle
only
a
small
number
of
people
did
and
i
trusted
them
all
to
the
end
of
the
earth
um
not
ringing
any
bells
i
said
i
done
some
pretty
cool
stuff
around
school
using
that
handle
i
was
very
proud
of
my
work
on
killers
and
if
he
could
link
the
two
identities
i
be
in
trouble
no
one
at
school
ever
called
me
or
even
winston
not
even
my
pals
it
was
marcus
or
nothing
benson
settled
down
behind
his
desk
and
tapped
his
nervously
on
his
blotter
he
did
this
whenever
things
started
to
go
bad
for
him
poker
players
call
stuff
like
this
a
tell
something
that
let
you
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
other
guy
head
i
knew
benson
tells
backwards
and
forwards
marcus
i
hope
you
realize
how
serious
this
is
i
will
just
as
soon
as
you
explain
what
this
is
sir
i
always
say
sir
to
authority
figures
when
i
messing
with
them
it
my
own
tell
he
shook
his
head
at
me
and
looked
down
another
tell
any
second
now
he
was
going
to
start
shouting
at
me
listen
kiddo
it
time
you
came
to
grips
with
the
fact
that
we
know
about
what
you
been
doing
and
that
we
not
going
to
be
lenient
about
it
you
going
to
be
lucky
if
you
not
expelled
before
this
meeting
is
through
do
you
want
to
graduate
mr
benson
you
still
have
explained
what
the
problem
is
he
slammed
his
hand
down
on
the
desk
and
then
pointed
his
finger
at
me
the
mr
yallow
is
that
you
been
engaged
in
criminal
conspiracy
to
subvert
this
school
security
system
and
you
have
supplied
security
countermeasures
to
your
fellow
students
you
know
that
we
expelled
graciella
uriarte
last
week
for
using
one
of
your
devices
uriarte
had
gotten
a
bad
rap
she
bought
a
from
a
near
the
street
bart
station
and
it
had
set
off
the
countermeasures
in
the
school
hallway
not
my
doing
but
i
felt
for
her
and
you
think
i
involved
in
that
we
have
reliable
intelligence
indicating
that
you
are
again
he
spelled
it
out
and
i
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
figured
out
that
the
was
an
i
and
the
was
an
we
know
that
this
character
is
responsible
for
the
theft
of
last
year
standardized
tests
that
actually
had
been
me
but
it
was
a
sweet
hack
and
it
was
kind
of
flattering
to
hear
it
attributed
to
me
and
therefore
liable
for
several
years
in
prison
unless
you
cooperate
with
me
you
have
intelligence
i
like
to
see
it
he
glowered
at
me
your
attitude
is
going
to
help
you
if
there
evidence
sir
i
think
you
should
call
the
police
and
turn
it
over
to
them
it
sounds
like
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
and
i
would
want
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
proper
investigation
by
the
duly
constituted
authorities
you
want
me
to
call
the
police
and
my
parents
i
think
that
would
be
for
the
best
we
stared
at
each
other
across
the
desk
he
clearly
expected
me
to
fold
the
second
he
dropped
the
bomb
on
me
i
do
fold
i
have
a
trick
for
staring
down
people
like
benson
i
look
slightly
to
the
left
of
their
heads
and
think
about
the
lyrics
to
old
irish
folk
songs
the
kinds
with
three
hundred
verses
it
makes
me
look
perfectly
composed
and
unworried
the
wing
was
on
the
bird
and
the
bird
was
on
the
egg
and
the
egg
was
in
the
nest
and
the
nest
was
on
the
leaf
and
the
leaf
was
on
the
twig
and
the
twig
was
on
the
branch
and
the
branch
was
on
the
limb
and
the
limb
was
in
the
tree
and
the
tree
was
in
the
bog
the
bog
down
in
the
the
rattlin
bog
the
bog
down
in
the
you
can
return
to
class
now
he
said
i
call
on
you
once
the
police
are
ready
to
speak
to
you
are
you
going
to
call
them
now
the
procedure
for
calling
in
the
police
is
complicated
i
hoped
that
we
could
settle
this
fairly
and
quickly
but
since
you
insist
i
can
wait
while
you
call
them
is
all
i
said
i
do
mind
he
tapped
his
ring
again
and
i
braced
for
the
blast
he
yelled
get
the
hell
out
of
my
office
you
miserable
little
i
got
out
keeping
my
expression
neutral
he
was
going
to
call
the
cops
if
he
had
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
police
with
he
would
have
called
them
in
the
first
place
he
hated
my
guts
i
figured
he
heard
some
unverified
gossip
and
hoped
to
spook
me
into
confirming
it
i
moved
down
the
corridor
lightly
and
sprightly
keeping
my
gait
even
and
measured
for
the
cameras
these
had
been
installed
only
a
year
before
and
i
loved
them
for
their
sheer
idiocy
beforehand
we
had
cameras
covering
nearly
every
public
space
in
school
but
a
court
ruled
that
was
unconstitutional
so
benson
and
a
lot
of
other
paranoid
school
administrators
had
spent
our
textbook
dollars
on
these
idiot
cameras
that
were
supposed
to
be
able
to
tell
one
person
walk
from
another
yeah
right
i
got
back
to
class
and
sat
down
again
ms
galvez
warmly
welcoming
me
back
i
unpacked
the
school
machine
and
got
back
into
classroom
mode
the
schoolbooks
were
the
snitchiest
technology
of
them
all
logging
every
keystroke
watching
all
the
network
traffic
for
suspicious
keywords
counting
every
click
keeping
track
of
every
fleeting
thought
you
put
out
over
the
net
we
gotten
them
in
my
junior
year
and
it
only
took
a
couple
months
for
the
shininess
to
wear
off
once
people
figured
out
that
these
free
laptops
worked
for
the
man
and
showed
a
parade
of
obnoxious
ads
to
boot
they
suddenly
started
to
feel
very
heavy
and
burdensome
cracking
my
schoolbook
had
been
easy
the
crack
was
online
within
a
month
of
the
machine
showing
up
and
there
was
nothing
to
it
just
download
a
dvd
image
burn
it
stick
it
in
the
schoolbook
and
boot
it
while
holding
down
a
bunch
of
different
keys
at
the
same
time
the
dvd
did
the
rest
installing
a
whole
bunch
of
hidden
programs
on
the
machine
programs
that
would
stay
hidden
even
when
the
board
of
ed
did
its
daily
remote
integrity
checks
of
the
machines
every
now
and
again
i
had
to
get
an
update
for
the
software
to
get
around
the
board
latest
tests
but
it
was
a
small
price
to
pay
to
get
a
little
control
over
the
box
i
fired
up
imparanoid
the
secret
instant
messenger
that
i
used
when
i
wanted
to
have
an
discussion
right
in
the
middle
of
class
darryl
was
already
logged
in
the
game
afoot
something
big
is
going
down
with
harajuku
fun
madness
dude
you
in
no
freaking
way
if
i
get
caught
ditching
a
third
time
i
expelled
man
you
know
that
we
go
after
school
you
got
lunch
and
then
right
that
two
hours
plenty
of
time
to
run
down
this
clue
and
get
back
before
anyone
misses
us
i
get
the
whole
team
out
harajuku
fun
madness
is
the
best
game
ever
made
i
know
i
already
said
that
but
it
bears
repeating
it
an
arg
an
alternate
reality
game
and
the
story
goes
that
a
gang
of
japanese
discovered
a
miraculous
healing
gem
at
the
temple
in
harajuku
which
is
basically
where
cool
japanese
teenagers
invented
every
major
subculture
for
the
past
ten
years
they
being
hunted
by
evil
monks
the
yakuza
aka
the
japanese
mafia
aliens
parents
and
a
rogue
artificial
intelligence
they
slip
the
players
coded
messages
that
we
have
to
decode
and
use
to
track
down
clues
that
lead
to
more
coded
messages
and
more
clues
imagine
the
best
afternoon
you
ever
spent
prowling
the
streets
of
a
city
checking
out
all
the
weird
people
funny
and
funky
shops
now
add
a
scavenger
hunt
to
that
one
that
requires
you
to
research
crazy
old
films
and
songs
and
teen
culture
from
around
the
world
and
across
time
and
space
and
it
a
competition
with
the
winning
team
of
four
taking
a
grand
prize
of
ten
days
in
tokyo
chilling
on
harajuku
bridge
geeking
out
in
akihabara
and
taking
home
all
the
astro
boy
merchandise
you
can
eat
except
that
he
called
atom
boy
in
japan
that
harajuku
fun
madness
and
once
you
solved
a
puzzle
or
two
you
never
look
back
no
man
just
no
no
do
even
ask
i
need
you
you
the
best
i
got
i
swear
i
get
us
in
and
out
without
anyone
knowing
it
you
know
i
can
do
that
right
i
know
you
can
do
it
so
you
in
hell
no
come
on
darryl
you
not
going
to
your
deathbed
wishing
you
spent
more
study
periods
sitting
in
school
i
not
going
to
go
to
my
deathbed
wishing
i
spent
more
time
playing
args
either
yeah
but
do
you
think
you
might
go
to
your
wishing
you
spent
more
time
with
vanessa
pak
van
was
part
of
my
team
she
went
to
a
private
girl
school
in
the
east
bay
but
i
knew
she
ditch
to
come
out
and
run
the
mission
with
me
darryl
has
had
a
crush
on
her
literally
for
years
even
before
puberty
endowed
her
with
many
lavish
gifts
darryl
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
mind
sad
really
you
suck
you
coming
he
looked
at
me
and
shook
his
head
then
he
nodded
i
winked
at
him
and
set
to
work
getting
in
touch
with
the
rest
of
my
team
i
was
always
into
arging
i
have
a
dark
secret
i
used
to
be
a
larper
larping
is
live
action
role
playing
and
it
just
about
what
it
sounds
like
running
around
in
costume
talking
in
a
funny
accent
pretending
to
be
a
or
a
vampire
or
a
medieval
knight
it
like
capture
the
flag
in
with
a
bit
of
drama
club
thrown
in
and
the
best
games
were
the
ones
we
played
in
scout
camps
out
of
town
in
sonoma
or
down
on
the
peninsula
those
epics
could
get
pretty
hairy
with
hikes
epic
battles
with
swords
casting
spells
by
throwing
beanbags
and
shouting
fireball
and
so
on
good
fun
if
a
little
goofy
not
nearly
as
geeky
as
talking
about
what
your
elf
planned
on
doing
as
you
sat
around
a
table
loaded
with
diet
coke
cans
and
painted
miniatures
and
more
physically
active
than
going
into
a
in
front
of
a
massively
multiplayer
game
at
home
the
thing
that
got
me
into
trouble
were
the
in
the
hotels
whenever
a
science
fiction
convention
came
to
town
some
larper
would
convince
them
to
let
us
run
a
couple
of
at
the
con
piggybacking
on
their
rental
of
the
space
having
a
bunch
of
enthusiastic
kids
running
around
in
costume
lent
color
to
the
event
and
we
got
to
have
a
ball
among
people
even
more
socially
deviant
than
us
the
problem
with
hotels
is
that
they
have
a
lot
of
in
them
too
and
not
just
people
normal
people
from
states
that
begin
and
end
with
vowels
on
holidays
and
sometimes
those
people
misunderstand
the
nature
of
a
game
let
just
leave
it
at
that
ok
class
ended
in
ten
minutes
and
that
did
leave
me
with
much
time
to
prepare
the
first
order
of
business
were
those
pesky
cameras
like
i
said
they
started
out
as
cameras
but
those
had
been
ruled
unconstitutional
as
far
as
i
know
no
court
has
yet
determined
whether
these
are
any
more
legal
but
until
they
do
we
stuck
with
them
gait
is
a
fancy
word
for
the
way
you
walk
people
are
pretty
good
at
spotting
gaits
next
time
you
on
a
camping
trip
check
out
the
bobbing
of
the
flashlight
as
a
distant
friend
approaches
you
chances
are
you
can
identify
him
just
from
the
movement
of
the
light
the
characteristic
way
it
bobs
up
and
down
that
tells
our
monkey
brains
that
this
is
a
person
approaching
us
gait
recognition
software
takes
pictures
of
your
motion
tries
to
isolate
you
in
the
pics
as
a
silhouette
and
then
tries
to
match
the
silhouette
to
a
database
to
see
if
it
knows
who
you
are
it
a
biometric
identifier
like
fingerprints
or
but
it
got
a
lot
more
collisions
than
either
of
those
a
biometric
collision
is
when
a
measurement
matches
more
than
one
person
only
you
have
your
fingerprint
but
you
share
your
gait
with
plenty
other
people
not
exactly
of
course
your
personal
walk
is
yours
and
yours
alone
the
problem
is
your
walk
changes
based
on
how
tired
you
are
what
the
floor
is
made
of
whether
you
pulled
your
ankle
playing
basketball
and
whether
you
changed
your
shoes
lately
so
the
system
kind
of
your
profile
looking
for
people
who
walk
kind
of
like
you
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
walk
kind
of
like
you
what
more
it
easy
not
to
walk
kind
of
like
you
just
take
one
shoe
off
of
course
you
always
walk
like
in
that
case
so
the
cameras
will
eventually
figure
out
that
it
still
you
which
is
why
i
prefer
to
inject
a
little
randomness
into
my
attacks
on
i
put
a
handful
of
gravel
into
each
shoe
cheap
and
effective
and
no
two
steps
are
the
same
plus
you
get
a
great
reflexology
foot
massage
in
the
process
i
kid
reflexology
is
about
as
scientifically
useful
as
the
cameras
used
to
set
off
an
alert
every
time
someone
they
did
recognize
stepped
onto
campus
this
did
work
the
alarm
went
off
every
ten
minutes
when
the
mailman
came
by
when
a
parent
dropped
in
when
the
went
to
work
fixing
up
the
basketball
court
when
a
student
showed
up
wearing
new
shoes
so
now
it
just
tries
to
keep
track
of
who
where
and
when
if
someone
leaves
by
the
during
classes
their
gait
is
checked
to
see
if
it
matches
any
student
gait
and
if
it
does
ring
the
alarm
chavez
high
is
ringed
with
gravel
walkways
i
like
to
keep
a
couple
handsful
of
rocks
in
my
just
in
case
i
silently
passed
darryl
ten
or
fifteen
pointy
little
bastards
and
we
both
loaded
our
shoes
class
was
about
to
finish
up
and
i
realized
that
i
still
had
checked
the
harajuku
fun
madness
site
to
see
where
the
next
clue
was
i
been
a
little
on
the
escape
and
had
bothered
to
figure
out
where
we
were
escaping
i
turned
to
my
schoolbook
and
hit
the
keyboard
the
we
used
was
supplied
with
the
machine
it
was
a
spyware
version
of
internet
explorer
microsoft
crashware
turd
that
no
one
under
the
age
of
used
voluntarily
i
had
a
copy
of
firefox
on
the
usb
drive
built
into
my
watch
but
that
was
enough
the
schoolbook
ran
windows
an
antique
operating
system
designed
to
give
school
administrators
the
illusion
that
they
controlled
the
programs
their
students
could
run
but
is
its
own
worst
enemy
there
are
a
lot
of
programs
that
does
want
you
to
be
able
to
shut
down
keyloggers
censorware
and
these
programs
run
in
a
special
mode
that
makes
them
invisible
to
the
system
you
ca
quit
them
because
you
ca
even
see
they
there
any
program
whose
name
starts
with
sys
is
invisible
to
the
operating
system
it
does
show
up
on
listings
of
the
hard
drive
nor
in
the
process
monitor
so
my
copy
of
firefox
was
called
sys
firefox
and
as
i
launched
it
it
became
invisible
to
windows
and
so
invisible
to
the
network
snoopware
now
i
had
an
indie
browser
running
i
needed
an
indie
network
connection
the
school
network
logged
every
click
in
and
out
of
the
system
which
was
bad
news
if
you
were
planning
on
surfing
over
to
the
harajuku
fun
madness
site
for
some
fun
the
answer
is
something
ingenious
called
tor
the
onion
router
an
onion
router
is
an
internet
site
that
takes
requests
for
and
passes
them
onto
other
onion
routers
and
on
to
other
onion
routers
until
one
of
them
finally
decides
to
fetch
the
page
and
pass
it
back
through
the
layers
of
the
onion
until
it
reaches
you
the
traffic
to
the
is
encrypted
which
means
that
the
school
ca
see
what
you
asking
for
and
the
layers
of
the
onion
do
know
who
they
working
for
there
are
millions
of
nodes
the
program
was
set
up
by
the
us
office
of
naval
research
to
help
their
people
get
around
the
censorware
in
countries
like
syria
and
china
which
means
that
it
perfectly
designed
for
operating
in
the
confines
of
an
average
american
high
school
tor
works
because
the
school
has
a
finite
blacklist
of
naughty
addresses
we
are
allowed
to
visit
and
the
addresses
of
the
nodes
change
all
the
time
no
way
could
the
school
keep
track
of
them
all
firefox
and
tor
together
made
me
into
the
invisible
man
impervious
to
board
of
ed
snooping
free
to
check
out
the
harajuku
fm
site
and
see
what
was
up
there
it
was
a
new
clue
like
all
harajuku
fun
madness
clues
it
had
a
physical
online
and
mental
component
the
online
component
was
a
puzzle
you
had
to
solve
one
that
required
you
to
research
the
answers
to
a
bunch
of
obscure
questions
this
batch
included
a
bunch
of
questions
on
the
plots
in
dojinshi
those
are
comic
books
drawn
by
fans
of
manga
japanese
comics
they
can
be
as
big
as
the
official
comics
that
inspire
them
but
they
a
lot
weirder
with
crossover
and
sometimes
really
silly
songs
and
action
lots
of
love
stories
of
course
everyone
loves
to
see
their
favorite
toons
hook
up
i
have
to
solve
those
riddles
later
when
i
got
home
they
were
easiest
to
solve
with
the
whole
team
downloading
tons
of
dojinshi
files
and
scouring
them
for
answers
to
the
puzzles
i
just
finished
all
the
clues
when
the
bell
rang
and
we
began
our
escape
i
surreptitiously
slid
the
gravel
down
the
side
of
my
short
boots
blundstones
from
australia
great
for
running
and
climbing
and
the
easy
laceless
design
makes
them
convenient
at
the
that
are
everywhere
now
we
also
had
to
evade
physical
surveillance
of
course
but
that
gets
easier
every
time
they
add
a
new
layer
of
physical
snoopery
all
the
bells
and
whistles
lull
our
beloved
faculty
into
a
totally
false
sense
of
security
we
surfed
the
crowd
down
the
hallways
heading
for
my
favorite
we
were
halfway
along
when
darryl
hissed
crap
i
forgot
i
got
a
library
book
in
my
bag
you
kidding
me
i
said
and
hauled
him
into
the
next
bathroom
we
passed
library
books
are
bad
news
every
one
of
them
has
an
arphid
radio
frequency
id
tag
glued
into
its
binding
which
makes
it
possible
for
the
librarians
to
check
out
the
books
by
waving
them
over
a
reader
and
lets
a
library
shelf
tell
you
if
any
of
the
books
on
it
are
out
of
place
but
it
also
lets
the
school
track
where
you
are
at
all
times
it
was
another
of
those
legal
loopholes
the
courts
would
let
the
schools
track
with
arphids
but
they
could
track
and
use
the
school
records
to
tell
them
who
was
likely
to
be
carrying
which
library
book
i
had
a
little
faraday
pouch
in
my
bag
these
are
little
wallets
lined
with
a
mesh
of
copper
wires
that
effectively
block
radio
energy
silencing
arphids
but
the
pouches
were
made
for
neutralizing
id
cards
and
transponders
not
books
like
introduction
to
physics
i
groaned
the
book
was
the
size
of
a
dictionary
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
the
largest
internet
bookseller
in
the
world
amazon
is
a
store
where
you
can
get
practically
any
book
ever
published
along
with
practically
everything
else
from
laptops
to
where
they
elevated
recommendations
to
a
high
art
where
they
allow
customers
to
directly
communicate
with
each
other
where
they
are
constantly
inventing
new
and
better
ways
of
connecting
books
with
readers
amazon
has
always
treated
me
like
gold
the
founder
jeff
bezos
even
posted
a
for
my
first
novel
and
i
shop
there
like
crazy
looking
at
my
spreadsheets
it
appears
that
i
buy
something
from
amazon
approximately
every
amazon
in
the
process
of
reinventing
what
it
means
to
be
a
bookstore
in
the
century
and
i
ca
think
of
a
better
group
of
people
to
be
facing
down
that
thorny
set
of
problems
amazon
http
i
thinking
of
majoring
in
physics
when
i
go
to
berkeley
darryl
said
his
dad
taught
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
which
meant
he
get
free
tuition
when
he
went
and
there
never
been
any
question
in
darryl
household
about
whether
he
go
fine
but
could
you
research
it
online
my
dad
said
i
should
read
it
besides
i
did
plan
on
committing
any
crimes
today
skipping
school
is
a
crime
it
an
infraction
they
totally
different
what
are
we
going
to
do
marcus
well
i
ca
hide
it
so
i
going
to
have
to
nuke
it
killing
arphids
is
a
dark
art
no
merchant
wants
malicious
customers
going
for
a
walk
around
the
and
leaving
behind
a
bunch
of
lobotomized
merchandise
that
is
missing
its
invisible
so
the
manufacturers
have
refused
to
implement
a
kill
signal
that
you
can
radio
to
an
arphid
to
get
it
to
switch
off
you
can
reprogram
arphids
with
the
right
box
but
i
hate
doing
that
to
library
books
it
not
exactly
tearing
pages
out
of
a
book
but
it
still
bad
since
a
book
with
a
reprogrammed
arphid
ca
be
shelved
and
ca
be
found
it
just
becomes
a
needle
in
a
haystack
that
left
me
with
only
one
option
nuking
the
thing
literally
seconds
in
a
microwave
will
do
in
pretty
much
every
arphid
on
the
market
and
because
the
arphid
would
answer
at
all
when
d
checked
it
back
in
at
the
library
they
just
print
a
fresh
one
for
it
and
recode
it
with
the
book
catalog
info
and
it
would
end
up
clean
and
neat
back
on
its
shelf
all
we
needed
was
a
microwave
give
it
another
two
minutes
and
the
teacher
lounge
will
be
empty
i
said
darryl
grabbed
his
book
at
headed
for
the
door
forget
it
no
way
i
going
to
class
i
snagged
his
elbow
and
dragged
him
back
come
on
d
easy
now
it
be
fine
the
maybe
you
were
listening
marcus
if
i
get
busted
once
i
am
you
hear
that
you
wo
get
caught
i
said
the
one
place
a
teacher
would
be
after
this
period
was
the
lounge
we
go
in
the
back
way
the
lounge
had
a
little
kitchenette
off
to
one
side
with
its
own
entrance
for
teachers
who
just
wanted
to
pop
in
and
get
a
cup
of
joe
the
microwave
which
always
reeked
of
popcorn
and
spilled
soup
was
right
in
there
on
top
of
the
miniature
fridge
darryl
groaned
i
thought
fast
look
the
bell
if
you
go
to
study
hall
now
you
get
a
better
not
to
show
at
all
at
this
point
i
can
infiltrate
and
exfiltrate
any
room
on
this
campus
you
seen
me
do
it
i
keep
you
safe
bro
he
groaned
again
that
was
one
of
darryl
tells
once
he
starts
groaning
he
ready
to
give
in
let
roll
i
said
and
we
took
off
it
was
flawless
we
skirted
the
classrooms
took
the
back
stairs
into
the
basement
and
came
up
the
front
stairs
right
in
front
of
the
teachers
lounge
not
a
sound
came
from
the
door
and
i
quietly
turned
the
knob
and
dragged
darryl
in
before
silently
closing
the
door
the
book
just
barely
fit
in
the
microwave
which
was
looking
even
less
sanitary
than
it
had
the
last
time
i
popped
in
here
to
use
it
i
conscientiously
wrapped
it
in
paper
towels
before
i
set
it
down
man
teachers
are
i
hissed
darryl
white
faced
and
tense
said
nothing
the
arphid
died
in
a
shower
of
sparks
which
was
really
quite
lovely
though
not
nearly
as
pretty
as
the
effect
you
get
when
you
nuke
a
frozen
grape
which
has
to
be
seen
to
be
believed
now
to
exfiltrate
the
campus
in
perfect
anonymity
and
make
our
escape
darryl
opened
the
door
and
began
to
move
out
me
on
his
heels
a
second
later
he
was
standing
on
my
toes
elbows
jammed
into
my
chest
as
he
tried
to
into
the
kitchen
we
just
left
get
back
he
whispered
urgently
quick
it
charles
charles
walker
and
i
do
get
along
we
in
the
same
grade
and
we
known
each
other
as
long
as
i
known
darryl
but
that
where
the
resemblance
ends
charles
has
always
been
big
for
his
age
and
now
that
he
playing
football
and
on
the
juice
he
even
bigger
he
got
anger
management
problems
i
lost
a
to
him
in
the
third
grade
and
he
managed
to
keep
from
getting
in
trouble
over
them
by
becoming
the
most
active
snitch
in
school
it
a
bad
combination
a
bully
who
also
snitches
taking
great
pleasure
in
going
to
the
teachers
with
whatever
infractions
he
found
benson
charles
charles
liked
to
let
on
that
he
had
some
kind
of
unspecified
bladder
problem
which
gave
him
a
excuse
to
prowl
the
hallways
at
chavez
looking
for
people
to
fink
on
the
last
time
charles
had
caught
some
dirt
on
me
it
had
ended
with
me
giving
up
larping
i
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
by
him
again
what
he
doing
he
coming
this
way
is
what
he
doing
darryl
said
he
was
shaking
ok
i
said
ok
time
for
emergency
countermeasures
i
got
my
phone
out
i
planned
this
well
in
advance
charles
would
never
get
me
again
i
emailed
my
server
at
home
and
it
got
into
motion
a
few
seconds
later
charles
phone
spazzed
out
spectacularly
i
had
tens
of
thousands
of
simultaneous
random
calls
and
text
messages
sent
to
it
causing
every
chirp
and
ring
it
had
to
go
off
and
keep
on
going
off
the
attack
was
accomplished
by
means
of
a
botnet
and
for
that
i
felt
bad
but
it
was
in
the
service
of
a
good
cause
botnets
are
where
infected
computers
spend
their
afterlives
when
you
get
a
worm
or
a
virus
your
computer
sends
a
message
to
a
chat
channel
on
irc
the
internet
relay
chat
that
message
tells
the
botmaster
the
guy
who
deployed
the
worm
that
the
computers
are
there
ready
to
do
his
bidding
botnets
are
supremely
powerful
since
they
can
comprise
thousands
even
hundreds
of
thousands
of
computers
scattered
all
over
the
internet
connected
to
juicy
connections
and
running
on
fast
home
pcs
those
pcs
normally
function
on
behalf
of
their
owners
but
when
the
botmaster
calls
them
they
rise
like
zombies
to
do
his
bidding
there
are
so
many
infected
pcs
on
the
internet
that
the
price
of
hiring
an
hour
or
two
on
a
botnet
has
crashed
mostly
these
things
work
for
spammers
as
cheap
distributed
spambots
filling
your
mailbox
with
for
or
with
new
viruses
that
can
infect
you
and
recruit
your
machine
to
join
the
botnet
i
just
rented
seconds
time
on
three
thousand
pcs
and
had
each
of
them
send
a
text
message
or
call
to
charles
phone
whose
number
i
extracted
from
a
sticky
note
on
benson
desk
during
one
fateful
needless
to
say
charles
phone
was
not
equipped
to
handle
this
first
the
smses
filled
the
memory
on
his
phone
causing
it
to
start
choking
on
the
routine
operations
it
needed
to
do
things
like
manage
the
ringer
and
log
all
those
incoming
calls
bogus
return
numbers
did
you
know
that
it
to
fake
the
return
number
on
a
caller
id
there
are
about
fifty
ways
of
doing
it
just
google
spoof
caller
id
charles
stared
at
it
dumbfounded
and
jabbed
at
it
furiously
his
thick
eyebrows
knotting
and
wiggling
as
he
struggled
with
the
demons
that
had
possessed
his
most
personal
of
devices
the
plan
was
working
so
far
but
he
was
doing
what
he
was
supposed
to
be
doing
next
he
was
supposed
to
go
find
some
place
to
sit
down
and
try
to
figure
out
how
to
get
his
phone
back
darryl
shook
me
by
the
shoulder
and
i
pulled
my
eye
away
from
the
crack
in
the
door
what
he
doing
darryl
whispered
i
totaled
his
phone
but
he
just
staring
at
it
now
instead
of
moving
on
it
was
going
to
be
easy
to
reboot
that
thing
once
the
memory
was
totally
filled
it
would
have
a
hard
time
loading
the
code
it
needed
to
delete
the
bogus
messages
and
there
was
no
for
texts
on
his
phone
so
he
have
to
manually
delete
all
of
the
thousands
of
messages
darryl
shoved
me
back
and
stuck
his
eye
up
to
the
door
a
moment
later
his
shoulders
started
to
shake
i
got
scared
thinking
he
was
panicking
but
when
he
pulled
back
i
saw
that
he
was
laughing
so
hard
that
tears
were
streaming
down
his
cheeks
galvez
just
totally
busted
him
for
being
in
the
halls
during
class
for
having
his
phone
out
you
should
have
seen
her
tear
into
him
she
was
really
enjoying
it
we
shook
hands
solemnly
and
snuck
back
out
of
the
corridor
down
the
stairs
around
the
back
out
the
door
past
the
fence
and
out
into
the
glorious
sunlight
of
afternoon
in
the
mission
valencia
street
had
never
looked
so
good
i
checked
my
watch
and
yelped
let
move
the
rest
of
the
gang
is
meeting
us
at
the
in
twenty
minutes
van
spotted
us
first
she
was
blending
in
with
a
group
of
korean
tourists
which
is
one
of
her
favorite
ways
of
camouflaging
herself
when
she
ditching
school
ever
since
the
truancy
moblog
went
live
our
world
is
full
of
nosy
shopkeepers
and
pecksniffs
who
take
it
upon
themselves
to
snap
our
piccies
and
put
them
on
the
net
where
they
can
be
perused
by
school
administrators
she
came
out
of
the
crowd
and
bounded
toward
us
darryl
has
had
a
thing
for
van
since
forever
and
she
sweet
enough
to
pretend
she
does
know
it
she
gave
me
a
hug
and
then
moved
onto
darryl
giving
him
a
quick
sisterly
kiss
on
the
cheek
that
made
him
go
red
to
the
tops
of
his
ears
the
two
of
them
made
a
funny
pair
darryl
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
though
he
wears
it
well
and
he
got
a
kind
of
pink
complexion
that
goes
red
in
the
cheeks
whenever
he
runs
or
gets
excited
he
been
able
to
grow
a
beard
since
we
were
but
thankfully
he
started
shaving
after
a
brief
period
known
to
our
gang
as
the
lincoln
years
and
he
tall
very
very
tall
like
basketball
player
tall
meanwhile
van
is
half
a
head
shorter
than
me
and
skinny
with
straight
black
hair
that
she
wears
in
crazy
elaborate
braids
that
she
researches
on
the
net
she
got
pretty
coppery
skin
and
dark
eyes
and
she
loves
big
glass
rings
the
size
of
radishes
which
click
and
clack
together
when
she
dances
where
jolu
she
said
how
are
you
van
darryl
asked
in
a
choked
voice
he
always
ran
a
step
behind
the
conversation
when
it
came
to
van
i
great
how
your
every
little
thing
oh
she
was
a
bad
bad
person
darryl
nearly
fainted
jolu
saved
him
from
social
disgrace
by
showing
up
just
then
in
an
oversize
leather
baseball
jacket
sharp
sneakers
and
a
meshback
cap
advertising
our
favorite
mexican
masked
wrestler
el
santo
junior
jolu
is
jose
luis
torrez
the
completing
member
of
our
foursome
he
went
to
a
catholic
school
in
the
outer
richmond
so
it
was
easy
for
him
to
get
out
but
he
always
did
no
one
exfiltrated
like
our
jolu
he
liked
his
jacket
because
it
hung
down
low
which
was
pretty
stylish
in
parts
of
the
city
and
covered
up
all
his
catholic
school
crap
which
was
like
a
for
nosy
jerks
with
the
truancy
moblog
bookmarked
on
their
phones
who
ready
to
go
i
asked
once
we
all
said
hello
i
pulled
out
my
phone
and
showed
them
the
map
i
downloaded
to
it
on
the
bart
near
as
i
can
work
out
we
wan
na
go
up
to
the
nikko
again
then
one
block
past
it
to
then
left
up
toward
van
ness
somewhere
in
there
we
should
find
the
wireless
signal
van
made
a
face
that
a
nasty
part
of
the
tenderloin
i
could
argue
with
her
that
part
of
san
francisco
is
one
of
the
weird
bits
you
go
in
through
the
hilton
front
entrance
and
it
all
touristy
stuff
like
the
turnaround
and
family
restaurants
go
through
to
the
other
side
and
you
in
the
where
every
tracked
out
transvestite
hooker
pimp
hissing
drug
dealer
and
cracked
up
homeless
person
in
town
was
concentrated
what
they
bought
and
sold
none
of
us
were
old
enough
to
be
a
part
of
though
there
were
plenty
of
hookers
our
age
plying
their
trade
in
the
look
on
the
bright
side
i
said
the
only
time
you
want
to
go
up
around
there
is
broad
daylight
none
of
the
other
players
are
going
to
go
near
it
until
tomorrow
at
the
earliest
this
is
what
we
in
the
arg
business
call
a
head
start
jolu
grinned
at
me
you
make
it
sound
like
a
good
thing
he
said
beats
eating
uni
i
said
we
going
to
talk
or
we
going
to
win
van
said
after
me
she
was
the
most
hardcore
player
in
our
group
she
took
winning
very
very
seriously
we
struck
out
four
good
friends
on
our
way
to
decode
a
clue
win
the
game
and
lose
everything
we
cared
about
forever
the
physical
component
of
today
clue
was
a
set
of
gps
coordinates
there
were
coordinates
for
all
the
major
cities
where
harajuku
fun
madness
was
played
where
we
find
a
wifi
signal
that
signal
was
being
deliberately
jammed
by
another
nearby
wifi
point
that
was
hidden
so
that
it
could
be
spotted
by
conventional
wifinders
little
that
told
you
when
you
were
within
range
of
someone
open
which
you
could
use
for
free
we
have
to
track
down
the
location
of
the
hidden
access
point
by
measuring
the
strength
of
the
visible
one
finding
the
spot
where
it
was
most
mysteriously
weakest
there
we
find
another
clue
last
time
it
had
been
in
the
special
of
the
day
at
anzu
the
swanky
sushi
restaurant
in
the
nikko
hotel
in
the
tenderloin
the
nikko
was
owned
by
japan
airlines
one
of
harajuku
fun
madness
sponsors
and
the
staff
had
all
made
a
big
fuss
over
us
when
we
finally
tracked
down
the
clue
they
given
us
bowls
of
miso
soup
and
made
us
try
uni
which
is
sushi
made
from
sea
urchin
with
the
texture
of
very
runny
cheese
and
a
smell
like
very
runny
but
it
tasted
good
or
so
darryl
told
me
i
was
going
to
eat
that
stuff
i
picked
up
the
wifi
signal
with
my
phone
wifinder
about
three
blocks
up
just
before
hyde
street
in
front
of
a
dodgy
asian
massage
parlor
with
a
red
blinking
closed
sign
in
the
window
the
network
name
was
harajukufm
so
we
knew
we
had
the
right
spot
if
it
in
there
i
not
going
darryl
said
you
all
got
your
wifinders
i
said
darryl
and
van
had
phones
with
wifinders
while
jolu
being
too
cool
to
carry
a
phone
bigger
than
his
pinky
finger
had
a
separate
little
directional
fob
ok
fan
out
and
see
what
we
see
you
looking
for
a
sharp
drop
off
in
the
signal
that
gets
worse
the
more
you
move
along
it
i
took
a
step
backward
and
ended
up
standing
on
someone
toes
a
female
voice
said
oof
and
i
spun
around
worried
that
some
was
going
to
stab
me
for
breaking
her
heels
instead
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
another
kid
my
age
she
had
a
shock
of
bright
pink
hair
and
a
sharp
face
with
big
sunglasses
that
were
practically
goggles
she
was
dressed
in
striped
tights
beneath
a
black
granny
dress
with
lots
of
little
japanese
decorer
toys
safety
pinned
to
it
anime
characters
old
world
leaders
emblems
from
foreign
she
held
up
a
camera
and
snapped
a
picture
of
me
and
my
crew
cheese
she
said
you
on
candid
no
way
i
said
you
would
i
will
she
said
i
will
send
this
photo
to
truant
watch
in
thirty
seconds
unless
you
four
back
off
from
this
clue
and
let
me
and
my
friends
here
run
it
down
you
can
come
back
in
one
hour
and
it
be
all
yours
i
think
that
more
than
fair
i
looked
behind
her
and
noticed
three
other
girls
in
similar
garb
one
with
blue
hair
one
with
green
and
one
with
purple
who
are
you
supposed
to
be
the
popsicle
squad
we
the
team
that
going
to
kick
your
team
ass
at
harajuku
fun
madness
she
said
and
i
the
one
who
this
about
to
upload
your
photo
and
get
you
in
much
behind
me
i
felt
van
start
forward
her
school
was
notorious
for
its
brawls
and
i
was
pretty
sure
she
was
ready
to
knock
this
chick
block
off
then
the
world
changed
forever
we
felt
it
first
that
sickening
lurch
of
the
cement
under
your
feet
that
every
californian
knows
instinctively
my
first
inclination
as
always
was
to
get
away
when
in
trouble
or
in
doubt
run
in
circles
scream
and
shout
but
the
fact
was
we
were
already
in
the
safest
place
we
could
be
not
in
a
building
that
could
fall
in
on
us
not
out
toward
the
middle
of
the
road
where
bits
of
falling
cornice
could
brain
us
earthquakes
are
eerily
quiet
at
first
anyway
but
this
was
quiet
this
was
loud
an
incredible
roaring
sound
that
was
louder
than
anything
i
ever
heard
before
the
sound
was
so
punishing
it
drove
me
to
my
knees
and
i
was
the
only
one
darryl
shook
my
arm
and
pointed
over
the
buildings
and
we
saw
it
then
a
huge
black
cloud
rising
from
the
northeast
from
the
direction
of
the
bay
there
was
another
rumble
and
the
cloud
of
smoke
spread
out
that
spreading
black
shape
we
all
grown
up
seeing
in
movies
someone
had
just
blown
up
something
in
a
big
way
there
were
more
rumbles
and
more
tremors
heads
appeared
at
windows
up
and
down
the
street
we
all
looked
at
the
mushroom
cloud
in
silence
then
the
sirens
started
i
heard
sirens
like
these
before
they
test
the
civil
defense
sirens
at
noon
on
tuesdays
but
i
only
heard
them
go
off
unscheduled
in
old
war
movies
and
video
games
the
kind
where
someone
is
bombing
someone
else
from
above
air
raid
sirens
the
wooooooo
sound
made
it
all
less
real
report
to
shelters
immediately
it
was
like
the
voice
of
god
coming
from
all
places
at
once
there
were
speakers
on
some
of
the
electric
poles
something
i
never
noticed
before
and
they
all
switched
on
at
once
report
to
shelters
immediately
shelters
we
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
what
shelters
the
cloud
was
rising
steadily
spreading
out
was
it
nuclear
were
we
breathing
in
our
last
breaths
the
girl
with
the
pink
hair
grabbed
her
friends
and
they
tore
ass
downhill
back
toward
the
bart
station
and
the
foot
of
the
hills
report
to
shelters
immediately
there
was
screaming
now
and
a
lot
of
running
around
tourists
you
can
always
spot
the
tourists
they
the
ones
who
think
california
warm
and
spend
their
san
francisco
holidays
freezing
in
shorts
and
scattered
in
every
direction
we
should
go
darryl
hollered
in
my
ear
just
barely
audible
over
the
shrieking
of
the
sirens
which
had
been
joined
by
traditional
police
sirens
a
dozen
sfpd
cruisers
screamed
past
us
report
to
shelters
immediately
down
to
the
bart
station
i
hollered
my
friends
nodded
we
closed
ranks
and
began
to
move
quickly
downhill

ca

we
passed
a
lot
of
people
in
the
road
on
the
way
to
the
powell
street
bart
they
were
running
or
walking
and
silent
or
shouting
and
panicked
homeless
people
cowered
in
doorways
and
watched
it
all
while
a
tall
black
tranny
hooker
shouted
at
two
mustached
young
men
about
something
the
closer
we
got
to
the
bart
the
worse
the
press
of
bodies
became
by
the
time
we
reached
the
stairway
down
into
the
station
it
was
a
a
huge
brawl
of
people
trying
to
crowd
their
way
down
a
narrow
staircase
i
had
my
face
crushed
up
against
someone
back
and
someone
else
was
pressed
into
my
back
darryl
was
still
beside
me
he
was
big
enough
that
he
was
hard
to
shove
and
jolu
was
right
behind
him
kind
of
hanging
on
to
his
waist
i
spied
vanessa
a
few
yards
away
trapped
by
more
people
screw
you
i
heard
van
yell
behind
me
pervert
get
your
hands
off
of
me
i
strained
around
against
the
crowd
and
saw
van
looking
with
disgust
at
an
older
guy
in
a
nice
suit
who
was
kind
of
smirking
at
her
she
was
digging
in
her
purse
and
i
knew
what
she
was
digging
for
do
mace
him
i
shouted
over
the
din
you
get
us
all
too
at
the
mention
of
the
word
mace
the
guy
looked
scared
and
kind
of
melted
back
though
the
crowd
kept
him
moving
forward
up
ahead
i
saw
someone
a
lady
in
a
hippie
dress
falter
and
fall
she
screamed
as
she
went
down
and
i
saw
her
thrashing
to
get
up
but
she
could
the
crowd
pressure
was
too
strong
as
i
neared
her
i
bent
to
help
her
up
and
was
nearly
knocked
over
her
i
ended
up
stepping
on
her
stomach
as
the
crowd
pushed
me
past
her
but
by
then
i
do
think
she
was
feeling
anything
i
was
as
scared
as
i
ever
been
there
was
screaming
everywhere
now
and
more
bodies
on
the
floor
and
the
press
from
behind
was
as
relentless
as
a
bulldozer
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
on
my
feet
we
were
in
the
open
concourse
where
the
turnstiles
were
it
was
hardly
any
better
here
the
enclosed
space
sent
the
voices
around
us
echoing
back
in
a
roar
that
made
my
head
ring
and
the
smell
and
feeling
of
all
those
bodies
made
me
feel
a
claustrophobia
i
never
known
i
was
prone
to
people
were
still
cramming
down
the
stairs
and
more
were
squeezing
past
the
turnstiles
and
down
the
escalators
onto
the
platforms
but
it
was
clear
to
me
that
this
was
going
to
have
a
happy
ending
want
to
take
our
chances
up
top
i
said
to
darryl
yes
hell
yes
he
said
this
is
vicious
i
looked
to
vanessa
there
was
no
way
she
hear
me
i
managed
to
get
my
phone
out
and
i
texted
her
we
getting
out
of
here
i
saw
her
feel
the
vibe
from
her
phone
then
look
down
at
it
and
then
back
at
me
and
nod
vigorously
darryl
meanwhile
had
clued
jolu
in
the
plan
darryl
shouted
in
my
ear
we
going
to
have
to
go
back
i
shouted
back
pointing
at
the
remorseless
crush
of
bodies
it
impossible
he
said
it
just
going
to
get
more
impossible
the
longer
we
wait
he
shrugged
van
worked
her
way
over
to
me
and
grabbed
hold
of
my
wrist
i
took
darryl
and
darryl
took
jolu
by
the
other
hand
and
we
pushed
out
it
was
easy
we
moved
about
three
inches
a
minute
at
first
then
slowed
down
even
more
when
we
reached
the
stairway
the
people
we
passed
were
none
too
happy
about
us
shoving
them
out
of
the
way
either
a
couple
people
swore
at
us
and
there
was
a
guy
who
looked
like
he
have
punched
me
if
he
been
able
to
get
his
arms
loose
we
passed
three
more
crushed
people
beneath
us
but
there
was
no
way
i
could
have
helped
them
by
that
point
i
was
even
thinking
of
helping
anyone
all
i
could
think
of
was
finding
the
spaces
in
front
of
us
to
move
into
of
darryl
mighty
straining
on
my
wrist
of
my
on
van
behind
me
we
popped
free
like
champagne
corks
an
eternity
later
blinking
in
the
grey
smoky
light
the
air
raid
sirens
were
still
blaring
and
the
sound
of
emergency
vehicles
sirens
as
they
tore
down
market
street
was
even
louder
there
was
almost
no
one
on
the
streets
anymore
just
the
people
trying
hopelessly
to
get
underground
a
lot
of
them
were
crying
i
spotted
a
bunch
of
empty
benches
usually
staked
out
by
skanky
winos
and
pointed
toward
them
we
moved
for
them
the
sirens
and
the
smoke
making
us
duck
and
hunch
our
shoulders
we
got
as
far
as
the
benches
before
darryl
fell
forward
we
all
yelled
and
vanessa
grabbed
him
and
turned
him
over
the
side
of
his
shirt
was
stained
red
and
the
stain
was
spreading
she
tugged
his
shirt
up
and
revealed
a
long
deep
cut
in
his
pudgy
side
someone
freaking
him
in
the
crowd
jolu
said
his
hands
clenching
into
fists
christ
that
vicious
darryl
groaned
and
looked
at
us
then
down
at
his
side
then
he
groaned
and
his
head
went
back
again
vanessa
took
off
her
jean
jacket
and
then
pulled
off
the
cotton
hoodie
she
was
wearing
underneath
it
she
wadded
it
up
and
pressed
it
to
darryl
side
take
his
head
she
said
to
me
keep
it
elevated
to
jolu
she
said
get
his
feet
up
roll
up
your
coat
or
something
jolu
moved
quickly
vanessa
mother
is
a
nurse
and
she
had
first
aid
training
every
summer
at
camp
she
loved
to
watch
people
in
movies
get
their
first
aid
wrong
and
make
fun
of
them
i
was
so
glad
to
have
her
with
us
we
sat
there
for
a
long
time
holding
the
hoodie
to
darryl
side
he
kept
insisting
that
he
was
fine
and
that
we
should
let
him
up
and
van
kept
telling
him
to
shut
up
and
lie
still
before
she
kicked
his
ass
what
about
calling
jolu
said
i
felt
like
an
idiot
i
whipped
my
phone
out
and
punched
the
sound
i
got
was
even
a
busy
signal
it
was
like
a
whimper
of
pain
from
the
phone
system
you
do
get
sounds
like
that
unless
there
three
million
people
all
dialing
the
same
number
at
once
who
needs
botnets
when
you
got
terrorists
what
about
wikipedia
jolu
said
no
phone
no
data
i
said
what
about
them
darryl
said
and
pointed
at
the
street
i
looked
where
he
was
pointing
thinking
i
see
a
cop
or
an
paramedic
but
there
was
no
one
there
it
ok
buddy
you
just
rest
i
said
no
you
idiot
what
about
the
cops
in
the
cars
there
he
was
right
every
five
seconds
a
cop
car
an
ambulance
or
a
firetruck
zoomed
past
they
could
get
us
some
help
i
was
such
an
idiot
come
on
then
i
said
let
get
you
where
they
can
see
you
and
flag
one
down
vanessa
did
like
it
but
i
figured
a
cop
was
going
to
stop
for
a
kid
waving
his
hat
in
the
street
not
that
day
they
just
might
stop
if
they
saw
darryl
bleeding
there
though
i
argued
briefly
with
her
and
darryl
settled
it
by
lurching
to
his
feet
and
dragging
himself
down
toward
market
street
the
first
vehicle
that
screamed
past
an
ambulance
did
even
slow
down
neither
did
the
cop
car
that
went
past
nor
the
firetruck
nor
the
next
three
darryl
was
in
good
shape
he
was
and
panting
van
sweater
was
soaked
in
blood
i
was
sick
of
cars
driving
right
past
me
the
next
time
a
car
appeared
down
market
street
i
stepped
right
out
into
the
road
waving
my
arms
over
my
head
shouting
the
car
slewed
to
a
stop
and
only
then
did
i
notice
that
it
was
a
cop
car
ambulance
or
it
was
a
jeep
like
an
armored
hummer
only
it
did
have
any
military
insignia
on
it
the
car
skidded
to
a
stop
just
in
front
of
me
and
i
jumped
back
and
lost
my
balance
and
ended
up
on
the
road
i
felt
the
doors
open
near
me
and
then
saw
a
confusion
of
booted
feet
moving
close
by
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
bunch
of
guys
in
coveralls
holding
big
bulky
rifles
and
wearing
hooded
gas
masks
with
tinted
i
barely
had
time
to
register
them
before
those
rifles
were
pointed
at
me
i
never
looked
down
the
barrel
of
a
gun
before
but
everything
you
heard
about
the
experience
is
true
you
freeze
where
you
are
time
stops
and
your
heart
thunders
in
your
ears
i
opened
my
mouth
then
shut
it
then
very
slowly
i
held
my
hands
up
in
front
of
me
the
faceless
eyeless
armed
man
above
me
kept
his
gun
very
level
i
did
even
breathe
van
was
screaming
something
and
jolu
was
shouting
and
i
looked
at
them
for
a
second
and
that
was
when
someone
put
a
coarse
sack
over
my
head
and
cinched
it
tight
around
my
windpipe
so
quick
and
so
fiercely
i
barely
had
time
to
gasp
before
it
was
locked
on
me
i
was
pushed
roughly
but
dispassionately
onto
my
stomach
and
something
went
twice
around
my
wrists
and
then
tightened
up
as
well
feeling
like
baling
wire
and
biting
cruelly
i
cried
out
and
my
own
voice
was
muffled
by
the
hood
i
was
in
total
darkness
now
and
i
strained
my
ears
to
hear
what
was
going
on
with
my
friends
i
heard
them
shouting
through
the
muffling
canvas
of
the
bag
and
then
i
was
being
impersonally
hauled
to
my
feet
by
my
wrists
my
arms
wrenched
up
behind
my
back
my
shoulders
screaming
i
stumbled
some
then
a
hand
pushed
my
head
down
and
i
was
inside
the
hummer
more
bodies
were
roughly
shoved
in
beside
me
guys
i
shouted
and
earned
a
hard
thump
on
my
head
for
my
trouble
i
heard
jolu
respond
then
felt
the
thump
he
was
dealt
too
my
head
rang
like
a
gong
hey
i
said
to
the
soldiers
hey
listen
we
just
high
school
students
i
wanted
to
flag
you
down
because
my
friend
was
bleeding
someone
stabbed
him
i
had
no
idea
how
much
of
this
was
making
it
through
the
muffling
bag
i
kept
talking
listen
this
is
some
kind
of
misunderstanding
we
got
to
get
my
friend
to
a
hospital
someone
went
upside
my
head
again
it
felt
like
they
used
a
baton
or
something
it
was
harder
than
anyone
had
ever
hit
me
in
the
head
before
my
eyes
swam
and
watered
and
i
literally
could
breathe
through
the
pain
a
moment
later
i
caught
my
breath
but
i
did
say
anything
i
learned
my
lesson
who
were
these
clowns
they
were
wearing
insignia
maybe
they
were
terrorists
i
never
really
believed
in
terrorists
before
i
mean
i
knew
that
in
the
abstract
there
were
terrorists
somewhere
in
the
world
but
they
did
really
represent
any
risk
to
me
there
were
millions
of
ways
that
the
world
could
kill
me
starting
with
getting
run
down
by
a
drunk
burning
his
way
down
valencia
that
were
infinitely
more
likely
and
immediate
than
terrorists
terrorists
killed
a
lot
fewer
people
than
bathroom
falls
and
accidental
electrocutions
worrying
about
them
always
struck
me
as
about
as
useful
as
worrying
about
getting
hit
by
lightning
sitting
in
the
back
of
that
hummer
my
head
in
a
hood
my
hands
lashed
behind
my
back
lurching
back
and
forth
while
the
bruises
swelled
up
on
my
head
terrorism
suddenly
felt
a
lot
riskier
the
car
rocked
back
and
forth
and
tipped
uphill
i
gathered
we
were
headed
over
nob
hill
and
from
the
angle
it
seemed
we
were
taking
one
of
the
steeper
routes
i
guessed
powell
street
now
we
were
descending
just
as
steeply
if
my
mental
map
was
right
we
were
heading
down
to
fisherman
wharf
you
could
get
on
a
boat
there
get
away
that
fit
with
the
terrorism
hypothesis
why
the
hell
would
terrorists
kidnap
a
bunch
of
high
school
students
we
rocked
to
a
stop
still
on
a
downslope
the
engine
died
and
then
the
doors
swung
open
someone
dragged
me
by
my
arms
out
onto
the
road
then
shoved
me
stumbling
down
a
paved
road
a
few
seconds
later
i
tripped
over
a
steel
staircase
bashing
my
shins
the
hands
behind
me
gave
me
another
shove
i
went
up
the
stairs
cautiously
not
able
to
use
my
hands
i
got
up
the
third
step
and
reached
for
the
fourth
but
it
was
there
i
nearly
fell
again
but
new
hands
grabbed
me
from
in
front
and
dragged
me
down
a
steel
floor
and
then
forced
me
to
my
knees
and
locked
my
hands
to
something
behind
me
more
movement
and
the
sense
of
bodies
being
shackled
in
alongside
of
me
groans
and
muffled
sounds
laughter
then
a
long
timeless
eternity
in
the
muffled
gloom
breathing
my
own
breath
hearing
my
own
breath
in
my
ears
i
actually
managed
a
kind
of
sleep
there
kneeling
with
the
circulation
cut
off
to
my
legs
my
head
in
canvas
twilight
my
body
had
squirted
a
year
supply
of
adrenalin
into
my
bloodstream
in
the
space
of
minutes
and
while
that
stuff
can
give
you
the
strength
to
lift
cars
off
your
loved
ones
and
leap
over
tall
buildings
the
payback
always
a
bitch
i
woke
up
to
someone
pulling
the
hood
off
my
head
they
were
neither
rough
nor
careful
just
impersonal
like
someone
at
mcdonald
putting
together
burgers
the
light
in
the
room
was
so
bright
i
had
to
squeeze
my
eyes
shut
but
slowly
i
was
able
to
open
them
to
slits
then
cracks
then
all
the
way
and
look
around
we
were
all
in
the
back
of
a
truck
a
big
i
could
see
the
at
regular
intervals
down
the
length
but
the
back
of
this
truck
had
been
turned
into
some
kind
of
mobile
steel
desks
lined
the
walls
with
banks
of
slick
displays
climbing
above
them
on
articulated
arms
that
let
them
be
repositioned
in
a
halo
around
the
operators
each
desk
had
a
gorgeous
in
front
of
it
festooned
with
knobs
for
adjusting
every
millimeter
of
the
sitting
surface
as
well
as
height
pitch
and
yaw
then
there
was
the
jail
part
at
the
front
of
the
truck
furthest
away
from
the
doors
there
were
steel
rails
bolted
into
the
sides
of
the
vehicle
and
attached
to
these
steel
rails
were
the
prisoners
i
spotted
van
and
jolu
right
away
darryl
might
have
been
in
the
remaining
dozen
shackled
up
back
here
but
it
was
impossible
to
say
many
of
them
were
slumped
over
and
blocking
my
view
it
stank
of
sweat
and
fear
back
there
vanessa
looked
at
me
and
bit
her
lip
she
was
scared
so
was
i
so
was
jolu
his
eyes
rolling
crazily
in
their
sockets
the
whites
showing
i
was
scared
what
more
i
had
to
piss
like
a
i
looked
around
for
our
captors
i
avoided
looking
at
them
up
until
now
the
same
way
you
do
look
into
the
dark
of
a
closet
where
your
mind
has
conjured
up
a
you
do
want
to
know
if
you
right
but
i
had
to
get
a
better
look
at
these
jerks
who
kidnapped
us
if
they
were
terrorists
i
wanted
to
know
i
did
know
what
a
terrorist
looked
like
though
tv
shows
had
done
their
best
to
convince
me
that
they
were
brown
arabs
with
big
beards
and
knit
caps
and
loose
cotton
dresses
that
hung
down
to
their
ankles
not
so
our
captors
they
could
have
been
cheerleaders
on
the
super
bowl
they
looked
in
a
way
i
could
exactly
define
good
short
neat
haircuts
that
were
quite
military
they
came
in
white
and
brown
male
and
female
and
smiled
freely
at
one
another
as
they
sat
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
truck
joking
and
drinking
coffees
out
of
these
were
from
afghanistan
they
looked
like
tourists
from
nebraska
i
stared
at
one
a
young
white
woman
with
brown
hair
who
barely
looked
older
than
me
kind
of
cute
in
a
scary
way
if
you
stare
at
someone
long
enough
they
eventually
look
back
at
you
she
did
and
her
face
slammed
into
a
totally
different
configuration
dispassionate
even
robotic
the
smile
vanished
in
an
instant
hey
i
said
look
i
do
understand
what
going
on
here
but
i
really
need
to
take
a
leak
you
know
she
looked
right
through
me
as
if
she
had
heard
i
serious
if
i
do
get
to
a
can
soon
i
going
to
have
an
ugly
accident
it
going
to
get
pretty
smelly
back
here
you
know
she
turned
to
her
colleagues
a
little
huddle
of
three
of
them
and
they
held
a
low
conversation
i
could
hear
over
the
fans
from
the
computers
she
turned
back
to
me
hold
it
for
another
ten
minutes
then
you
each
get
a
i
do
think
i
got
another
ten
minutes
in
me
i
said
letting
a
little
more
urgency
than
i
was
really
feeling
creep
into
my
voice
seriously
lady
it
now
or
never
she
shook
her
head
and
looked
at
me
like
i
was
some
kind
of
pathetic
loser
she
and
her
friends
conferred
some
more
then
another
one
came
forward
he
was
older
in
his
early
thirties
and
pretty
big
across
the
shoulders
like
he
worked
out
he
looked
like
he
was
chinese
or
korean
even
van
ca
tell
the
difference
sometimes
but
with
that
bearing
that
said
in
a
way
i
could
put
my
finger
on
he
pulled
his
aside
to
let
me
see
the
hardware
strapped
there
i
recognized
a
pistol
a
tazer
and
a
can
of
either
mace
or
before
he
let
it
fall
again
no
trouble
he
said
none
i
agreed
he
touched
something
at
his
belt
and
the
shackles
behind
me
let
go
my
arms
dropping
suddenly
behind
me
it
was
like
he
was
wearing
batman
utility
belt
wireless
remotes
for
shackles
i
guessed
it
made
sense
though
you
would
want
to
lean
over
your
prisoners
with
all
that
deadly
hardware
at
their
they
might
grab
your
gun
with
their
teeth
and
pull
the
trigger
with
their
tongues
or
something
my
hands
were
still
lashed
together
behind
me
by
the
plastic
strapping
and
now
that
i
was
supported
by
the
shackles
i
found
that
my
legs
had
turned
into
lumps
of
cork
while
i
was
stuck
in
one
position
long
story
short
i
basically
fell
onto
my
face
and
kicked
my
legs
weakly
as
they
went
trying
to
get
them
under
me
so
i
could
rock
up
to
my
feet
the
guy
jerked
me
to
my
feet
and
i
to
the
very
back
of
the
truck
to
a
little
there
i
tried
to
spot
darryl
on
the
way
back
but
he
could
have
been
any
of
the
five
or
six
slumped
people
or
none
of
them
in
you
go
the
guy
said
i
jerked
my
wrists
take
these
off
please
my
fingers
felt
like
purple
sausages
from
the
hours
of
bondage
in
the
plastic
cuffs
the
guy
did
move
look
i
said
trying
not
to
sound
sarcastic
or
angry
it
was
easy
look
you
either
cut
my
wrists
free
or
you
going
to
have
to
aim
for
me
a
toilet
visit
is
not
a
experience
someone
in
the
truck
sniggered
the
guy
did
like
me
i
could
tell
from
the
way
his
jaw
muscles
ground
around
man
these
people
were
wired
tight
he
reached
down
to
his
belt
and
came
up
with
a
very
nice
set
of
he
flicked
out
a
knife
and
sliced
through
the
plastic
cuffs
and
my
hands
were
my
own
again
thanks
i
said
he
shoved
me
into
the
bathroom
my
hands
were
useless
like
lumps
of
clay
on
the
ends
of
my
wrists
as
i
wiggled
my
fingers
limply
they
tingled
then
the
tingling
turned
to
a
burning
feeling
that
almost
made
me
cry
out
i
put
the
seat
down
dropped
my
pants
and
sat
down
i
did
trust
myself
to
stay
on
my
feet
as
my
bladder
cut
loose
so
did
my
eyes
i
wept
crying
silently
and
rocking
back
and
forth
while
the
tears
and
snot
ran
down
my
face
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
sobbing
i
covered
my
mouth
and
held
the
sounds
in
i
did
want
to
give
them
the
satisfaction
finally
i
was
peed
out
and
cried
out
and
the
guy
was
pounding
on
the
door
i
cleaned
my
face
as
best
as
i
could
with
wads
of
toilet
paper
stuck
it
all
down
the
john
and
flushed
then
looked
around
for
a
sink
but
only
found
a
of
covered
in
lists
of
the
it
worked
on
i
rubbed
some
into
my
hands
and
stepped
out
of
the
john
what
were
you
doing
in
there
the
guy
said
using
the
facilities
i
said
he
turned
me
around
and
grabbed
my
hands
and
i
felt
a
new
pair
of
plastic
cuffs
go
around
them
my
wrists
had
swollen
since
the
last
pair
had
come
off
and
the
new
ones
bit
cruelly
into
my
tender
skin
but
i
refused
to
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
crying
out
he
shackled
me
back
to
my
spot
and
grabbed
the
next
person
down
who
i
saw
now
was
jolu
his
face
puffy
and
an
ugly
bruise
on
his
cheek
are
you
ok
i
asked
him
and
my
friend
with
the
utility
belt
abruptly
put
his
hand
on
my
forehead
and
shoved
hard
bouncing
the
back
of
my
head
off
the
truck
metal
wall
with
a
sound
like
a
clock
striking
one
no
talking
he
said
as
i
struggled
to
refocus
my
eyes
i
did
like
these
people
i
decided
right
then
that
they
would
pay
a
price
for
all
this
one
by
one
all
the
prisoners
went
to
the
can
and
came
back
and
when
they
were
done
my
guard
went
back
to
his
friends
and
had
another
cup
of
coffee
they
were
drinking
out
of
a
big
cardboard
urn
of
starbucks
i
saw
and
they
had
an
indistinct
conversation
that
involved
a
fair
bit
of
laughter
then
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
truck
opened
and
there
was
fresh
air
not
smoky
the
way
it
had
been
before
but
tinged
with
ozone
in
the
slice
of
outdoors
i
saw
before
the
door
closed
i
caught
that
it
was
dark
out
and
raining
with
one
of
those
san
francisco
drizzles
that
part
mist
the
man
who
came
in
was
wearing
a
military
uniform
a
us
military
uniform
he
saluted
the
people
in
the
truck
and
they
saluted
him
back
and
that
when
i
knew
that
i
was
a
prisoner
of
some
terrorists
i
was
a
prisoner
of
the
united
states
of
america
they
set
up
a
little
screen
at
the
end
of
the
truck
and
then
came
for
us
one
at
a
time
unshackling
us
and
leading
us
to
the
back
of
the
truck
as
close
as
i
could
work
it
counting
seconds
off
in
my
head
one
hippopotami
two
hippopotami
the
interviews
lasted
about
seven
minutes
each
my
head
throbbed
with
dehydration
and
caffeine
withdrawal
i
was
third
brought
back
by
the
woman
with
the
severe
haircut
up
close
she
looked
tired
with
bags
under
her
eyes
and
grim
lines
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
thanks
i
said
automatically
as
she
unlocked
me
with
a
remote
and
then
dragged
me
to
my
feet
i
hated
myself
for
the
automatic
politeness
but
it
had
been
drilled
into
me
she
did
twitch
a
muscle
i
went
ahead
of
her
to
the
back
of
the
truck
and
behind
the
screen
there
was
a
single
folding
chair
and
i
sat
in
it
two
of
them
severe
haircut
woman
and
utility
belt
man
looked
at
me
from
their
ergonomic
they
had
a
little
table
between
them
with
the
contents
of
my
wallet
and
backpack
spread
out
on
it
hello
marcus
severe
haircut
woman
said
we
have
some
questions
for
you
am
i
under
arrest
i
asked
this
was
an
idle
question
if
you
not
under
arrest
there
are
limits
on
what
the
cops
can
and
ca
do
to
you
for
starters
they
ca
hold
you
forever
without
arresting
you
giving
you
a
phone
call
and
letting
you
talk
to
a
lawyer
and
was
i
ever
going
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
what
this
for
she
said
holding
up
my
phone
the
screen
was
showing
the
error
message
you
got
if
you
kept
trying
to
get
into
its
data
without
giving
the
right
password
it
was
a
bit
of
a
rude
message
an
animated
hand
giving
a
certain
universally
recognized
gesture
because
i
liked
to
customize
my
gear
am
i
under
arrest
i
repeated
they
ca
make
you
answer
any
questions
if
you
not
under
arrest
and
when
you
ask
if
you
under
arrest
they
have
to
answer
you
it
the
rules
you
being
detained
by
the
department
of
homeland
security
the
woman
snapped
am
i
under
arrest
you
going
to
be
more
cooperative
marcus
starting
right
now
she
did
say
or
else
but
it
was
implied
i
would
like
to
contact
an
attorney
i
said
i
would
like
to
know
what
i
been
charged
with
i
would
like
to
see
some
form
of
identification
from
both
of
you
the
two
agents
exchanged
looks
i
think
you
should
really
reconsider
your
approach
to
this
situation
severe
haircut
woman
said
i
think
you
should
do
that
right
now
we
found
a
number
of
suspicious
devices
on
your
person
we
found
you
and
your
confederates
near
the
site
of
the
worst
terrorist
attack
this
country
has
ever
seen
put
those
two
facts
together
and
things
do
look
very
good
for
you
marcus
you
can
cooperate
or
you
can
be
very
very
sorry
now
what
is
this
for
you
think
i
a
terrorist
i
seventeen
years
old
just
the
right
age
al
qaeda
loves
recruiting
impressionable
idealistic
kids
we
googled
you
you
know
you
posted
a
lot
of
very
ugly
stuff
on
the
public
internet
i
would
like
to
speak
to
an
attorney
i
said
severe
haircut
lady
looked
at
me
like
i
was
a
bug
you
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
you
been
picked
up
by
the
police
for
a
crime
you
need
to
get
past
that
you
are
being
detained
as
a
potential
enemy
combatant
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
if
i
were
you
i
be
thinking
very
hard
about
how
to
convince
us
that
you
are
not
an
enemy
combatant
very
hard
because
there
are
dark
holes
that
enemy
combatants
can
disappear
into
very
dark
deep
holes
holes
where
you
can
just
vanish
forever
are
you
listening
to
me
young
man
i
want
you
to
unlock
this
phone
and
then
decrypt
the
files
in
its
memory
i
want
you
to
account
for
yourself
why
were
you
out
on
the
street
what
do
you
know
about
the
attack
on
this
city
i
not
going
to
unlock
my
phone
for
you
i
said
indignant
my
phone
memory
had
all
kinds
of
private
stuff
on
it
photos
emails
little
hacks
and
mods
i
installed
that
private
stuff
what
have
you
got
to
hide
i
got
the
right
to
my
privacy
i
said
and
i
want
to
speak
to
an
attorney
this
is
your
last
chance
kid
honest
people
do
have
anything
to
hide
i
want
to
speak
to
an
attorney
my
parents
would
pay
for
it
all
the
faqs
on
getting
arrested
were
clear
on
this
point
just
keep
asking
to
see
an
attorney
no
matter
what
they
say
or
do
there
no
good
that
comes
of
talking
to
the
cops
without
your
lawyer
present
these
two
said
they
were
cops
but
if
this
was
an
arrest
what
was
it
in
hindsight
maybe
i
should
have
unlocked
my
phone
for
them
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
barnes
and
noble
a
us
national
chain
of
bookstores
as
america
bookstores
were
vanishing
barnes
and
noble
started
to
build
these
gigantic
temples
to
reading
all
across
the
land
stocking
tens
of
thousands
of
titles
the
mall
bookstores
and
spinner
racks
had
stocked
a
small
fraction
of
that
and
keeping
long
hours
that
were
convenient
to
families
working
people
and
others
potential
readers
the
b

stores
kept
the
careers
of
many
writers
afloat
stocking

that
smaller
stores
could
possibly
afford
to
keep
on
their
limited
shelves
b

has
always
had
strong
community
outreach
programs
and
i
done
some
of
my
signings
at

including
the
great
events
at
the
sadly
departed

after

awards
took
place
and
the
b
n
in
chicago
that
hosted
the
event
after
the
nebs
a
few
years
later
best
of
all
is
that
b

geeky
buyers
really
get
it
when
it
comes
to
science
fiction
comics
and
manga
games
and
similar
titles
they
passionate
and
knowledgeable
about
the
field
and
it
shows
in
the
excellent
selection
on
display
at
the
stores
barnes
and
noble
nationwide
http
they
and
me
and
left
me
there
a
long
time
later
the
truck
started
to
move
rolling
downhill
and
then
i
was
hauled
back
to
my
feet
i
immediately
fell
over
my
legs
were
so
asleep
they
felt
like
blocks
of
ice
all
except
my
knees
which
were
swollen
and
tender
from
all
the
hours
of
kneeling
hands
grabbed
my
shoulders
and
feet
and
i
was
picked
up
like
a
sack
of
potatoes
there
were
indistinct
voices
around
me
someone
crying
someone
cursing
i
was
carried
a
short
distance
then
set
down
and
to
another
railing
my
knees
would
support
me
anymore
and
i
pitched
forward
ending
up
twisted
on
the
ground
like
a
pretzel
straining
against
the
chains
holding
my
wrists
then
we
were
moving
again
and
this
time
it
was
like
driving
in
a
truck
the
floor
beneath
me
rocked
gently
and
vibrated
with
heavy
diesel
engines
and
i
realized
i
was
on
a
ship
my
stomach
turned
to
ice
i
was
being
taken
off
america
shores
to
somewhere
and
who
the
hell
knew
where
that
was
i
been
scared
before
but
this
thought
me
left
me
paralyzed
and
wordless
with
fear
i
realized
that
i
might
never
see
my
parents
again
and
i
actually
tasted
a
little
vomit
burn
up
my
throat
the
bag
over
my
head
closed
in
on
me
and
i
could
barely
breathe
something
that
was
compounded
by
the
weird
position
i
was
twisted
into
but
mercifully
we
were
on
the
water
for
very
long
it
felt
like
an
hour
but
i
know
now
that
it
was
a
mere
fifteen
minutes
and
then
i
felt
us
docking
felt
footsteps
on
the
decking
around
me
and
felt
other
prisoners
being
unshackled
and
carried
or
led
away
when
they
came
for
me
i
tried
to
stand
again
but
could
and
they
carried
me
again
impersonally
roughly
when
they
took
the
hood
off
again
i
was
in
a
cell
the
cell
was
old
and
crumbled
and
smelled
of
sea
air
there
was
one
window
high
up
and
rusted
bars
guarded
it
it
was
still
dark
outside
there
was
a
blanket
on
the
floor
and
a
little
metal
toilet
without
a
seat
set
into
the
wall
the
guard
who
took
off
my
hood
grinned
at
me
and
closed
the
solid
steel
door
behind
him
i
gently
massaged
my
legs
hissing
as
the
blood
came
back
into
them
and
into
my
hands
eventually
i
was
able
to
stand
and
then
to
pace
i
heard
other
people
talking
crying
shouting
i
did
some
shouting
too
jolu
darryl
vanessa
other
voices
on
the
took
up
the
cry
shouting
out
names
too
shouting
out
obscenities
the
nearest
voices
sounded
like
drunks
losing
their
minds
on
a
maybe
i
sounded
like
that
too
guards
shouted
at
us
to
be
quiet
and
that
just
made
everyone
yell
louder
eventually
we
were
all
howling
screaming
our
heads
off
screaming
our
throats
raw
why
not
what
did
we
have
to
lose
the
next
time
they
came
to
question
me
i
was
filthy
and
tired
thirsty
and
hungry
severe
haircut
lady
was
in
the
new
questioning
party
as
were
three
big
guys
who
moved
me
around
like
a
cut
of
meat
one
was
black
the
other
two
were
white
though
one
might
have
been
hispanic
they
all
carried
guns
it
was
like
a
benneton
ad
crossed
with
a
game
of
they
taken
me
from
my
cell
and
chained
my
wrists
and
ankles
together
i
paid
attention
to
my
surroundings
as
we
went
i
heard
water
outside
and
thought
that
maybe
we
were
on
alcatraz
it
was
a
prison
after
all
even
if
it
had
been
a
tourist
attraction
for
generations
the
place
where
you
went
to
see
where
al
capone
and
his
gangster
contemporaries
did
their
time
but
i
been
to
alcatraz
on
a
school
trip
it
was
old
and
rusted
medieval
this
place
felt
like
it
dated
back
to
world
war
two
not
colonial
times
there
were
on
stickers
and
placed
on
each
of
the
and
numbers
but
other
than
that
there
was
no
way
to
tell
who
or
what
might
be
behind
them
the
interrogation
room
was
modern
with
fluorescent
lights
ergonomic
chairs
not
for
me
though
i
got
a
folding
plastic
and
a
big
wooden
table
a
mirror
lined
one
wall
just
like
in
the
cop
shows
and
i
figured
someone
or
other
must
be
watching
from
behind
it
severe
haircut
lady
and
her
friends
helped
themselves
to
coffees
from
an
urn
on
a
i
could
have
torn
her
throat
out
with
my
teeth
and
taken
her
coffee
just
then
and
then
set
a
styrofoam
cup
of
water
down
next
to
me
without
unlocking
my
wrists
from
behind
my
back
so
i
could
reach
it
hardy
har
har
hello
marcus
severe
haircut
woman
said
how
your
doing
today
i
did
say
anything
this
is
as
bad
as
it
gets
you
know
she
said
this
is
as
as
it
gets
from
now
on
even
once
you
tell
us
what
we
want
to
know
even
if
that
convinces
us
that
you
were
just
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
you
a
marked
man
now
we
be
watching
you
everywhere
you
go
and
everything
you
do
you
acted
like
you
got
something
to
hide
and
we
do
like
that
it
pathetic
but
all
my
brain
could
think
about
was
that
phrase
convince
us
that
you
were
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
this
was
the
worst
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
me
i
had
never
ever
felt
this
bad
or
this
scared
before
those
words
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
those
six
words
they
were
like
a
lifeline
dangling
before
me
as
i
thrashed
to
stay
on
the
surface
hello
marcus
she
snapped
her
fingers
in
front
of
my
face
over
here
marcus
there
was
a
little
smile
on
her
face
and
i
hated
myself
for
letting
her
see
my
fear
marcus
it
can
be
a
lot
worse
than
this
this
is
the
worst
place
we
can
put
you
not
by
a
damned
sight
she
reached
down
below
the
table
and
came
out
with
a
briefcase
which
she
snapped
open
from
it
she
withdrew
my
phone
my
arphid
my
wifinder
and
my
memory
keys
she
set
them
down
on
the
table
one
after
the
other
here
what
we
want
from
you
you
unlock
the
phone
for
us
today
if
you
do
that
you
get
outdoor
and
bathing
privileges

a
shower
and
you
be
allowed
to
walk
around

the
exercise
yard

you
to
decrypt
the
data
on
these
memory
sticks

that
and
you
get
to
eat
in
the
mess
hall
the
day
after
we
going
to
want
your
email
passwords
and
that
will
get
you
library
privileges
the
word
no
was
on
my
lips
like
a
burp
trying
to
come
up
but
it
would
come
why
is
what
came
out
instead
we
want
to
be
sure
that
you
what
you
seem
to
be
this
is
about
your
security
marcus
say
you
innocent
you
might
be
though
why
an
innocent
man
would
act
like
he
got
so
much
to
hide
is
beyond
me
but
say
you
are
you
could
have
been
on
that
bridge
when
it
blew
your
parents
could
have
been
your
friends
do
you
want
us
to
catch
the
people
who
attacked
your
home
it
funny
but
when
she
was
talking
about
my
getting
privileges
it
scared
me
into
submission
i
felt
like
i
done
to
end
up
where
i
was
like
maybe
it
was
partially
my
fault
like
i
could
do
something
to
change
it
but
as
soon
as
she
switched
to
this
bs
about
safety
and
security
my
spine
came
back
lady
i
said
you
talking
about
attacking
my
home
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
you
the
only
one
who
attacked
me
lately
i
thought
i
lived
in
a
country
with
a
constitution
i
thought
i
lived
in
a
country
where
i
had
you
talking
about
defending
my
freedom
by
tearing
up
the
bill
of
rights
a
flicker
of
annoyance
passed
over
her
face
then
went
away
so
melodramatic
marcus
no
one
attacked
you
you
been
detained
by
your
country
government
while
we
seek
details
on
the
worst
terrorist
attack
ever
perpetrated
on
our
nation
soil
you
have
it
within
your
power
to
help
us
fight
this
war
on
our
nation
enemies
you
want
to
preserve
the
bill
of
rights
help
us
stop
bad
people
from
blowing
up
your
city
now
you
have
exactly
thirty
seconds
to
unlock
that
phone
before
i
send
you
back
to
your
cell
we
have
lots
of
other
people
to
interview
today
she
looked
at
her
watch
i
rattled
my
wrists
rattled
the
chains
that
kept
me
from
reaching
around
and
unlocking
the
phone
yes
i
was
going
to
do
it
she
told
me
what
my
path
was
to
freedom
to
the
world
to
my
parents
and
that
had
given
me
hope
now
she
threatened
to
send
me
away
to
take
me
off
that
path
and
my
hope
had
crashed
and
all
i
could
think
of
was
how
to
get
back
on
it
so
i
rattled
my
wrists
wanting
to
get
to
my
phone
and
unlock
it
for
her
and
she
just
looked
at
me
coldly
checking
her
watch
the
password
i
said
finally
understanding
what
she
wanted
of
me
she
wanted
me
to
say
it
out
loud
here
where
she
could
record
it
where
her
pals
could
hear
it
she
did
want
me
to
just
unlock
the
phone
she
wanted
me
to
submit
to
her
to
put
her
in
charge
of
me
to
give
up
every
secret
all
my
privacy
the
password
i
said
again
and
then
i
told
her
the
password
god
help
me
i
submitted
to
her
will
she
smiled
a
little
prim
smile
which
had
to
be
her
equivalent
of
a
touchdown
dance
and
the
guards
led
me
away
as
the
door
closed
i
saw
her
bend
down
over
the
phone
and
key
the
password
in
i
wish
i
could
say
that
i
anticipated
this
possibility
in
advance
and
created
a
fake
password
that
unlocked
a
completely
innocuous
partition
on
my
phone
but
i
was
nearly
that
you
might
be
wondering
at
this
point
what
dark
secrets
i
had
locked
away
on
my
phone
and
memory
sticks
and
email
i
just
a
kid
after
all
the
truth
is
that
i
had
everything
to
hide
and
nothing
between
my
phone
and
my
memory
sticks
you
could
get
a
pretty
good
idea
of
who
my
friends
were
what
i
thought
of
them
all
the
goofy
things
we
done
you
could
read
the
transcripts
of
the
electronic
arguments
we
carried
out
and
the
electronic
reconciliations
we
arrived
at
you
see
i
do
delete
stuff
why
would
i
storage
is
cheap
and
you
never
know
when
you
going
to
want
to
go
back
to
that
stuff
especially
the
stupid
stuff
you
know
that
feeling
you
get
sometimes
where
you
sitting
on
the
subway
and
there
no
one
to
talk
to
and
you
suddenly
remember
some
bitter
fight
you
had
some
terrible
thing
you
said
well
it
usually
never
as
bad
as
you
remember
being
able
to
go
back
and
see
it
again
is
a
great
way
to
remind
yourself
that
you
not
as
horrible
a
person
as
you
think
you
are
darryl
and
i
have
gotten
over
more
fights
that
way
than
i
can
count
and
even
that
not
it
i
know
my
phone
is
private
i
know
my
memory
sticks
are
private
that
because
of
cryptography
message
scrambling
the
math
behind
crypto
is
good
and
solid
and
you
and
me
get
access
to
the
same
crypto
that
banks
and
the
national
security
agency
use
there
only
one
kind
of
crypto
that
anyone
uses
crypto
that
public
open
and
can
be
deployed
by
anyone
that
how
you
know
it
works
there
something
really
liberating
about
having
some
corner
of
your
life
that
that
no
one
gets
to
see
except
you
it
a
little
like
nudity
or
taking
a
dump
everyone
gets
naked
every
once
in
a
while
everyone
has
to
squat
on
the
toilet
there
nothing
shameful
deviant
or
weird
about
either
of
them
but
what
if
i
decreed
that
from
now
on
every
time
you
went
to
evacuate
some
solid
waste
you
have
to
do
it
in
a
glass
room
perched
in
the
middle
of
times
square
and
you
be
buck
naked
even
if
you
got
nothing
wrong
or
weird
with
your
body
and
how
many
of
us
can
say
that
you
have
to
be
pretty
strange
to
like
that
idea
most
of
us
would
run
screaming
most
of
us
would
hold
it
in
until
we
exploded
it
not
about
doing
something
shameful
it
about
doing
something
it
about
your
life
belonging
to
you
they
were
taking
that
from
me
piece
by
piece
as
i
walked
back
to
my
cell
that
feeling
of
deserving
it
came
back
to
me
i
broken
a
lot
of
rules
all
my
life
and
i
gotten
away
with
it
by
and
large
maybe
this
was
justice
maybe
this
was
my
past
coming
back
to
me
after
all
i
had
been
where
i
was
because
i
snuck
out
of
school
i
got
my
shower
i
got
to
walk
around
the
yard
there
was
a
patch
of
sky
overhead
and
it
smelled
like
the
bay
area
but
beyond
that
i
had
no
clue
where
i
was
being
held
no
other
prisoners
were
visible
during
my
exercise
period
and
i
got
pretty
bored
with
walking
in
circles
i
strained
my
ears
for
any
sound
that
might
help
me
understand
what
this
place
was
but
all
i
heard
was
the
occasional
vehicle
some
distant
conversations
a
plane
landing
somewhere
nearby
they
brought
me
back
to
my
cell
and
fed
me
a
half
a
pepperoni
pie
from
goat
hill
pizza
which
i
knew
well
up
on
potrero
hill
the
carton
with
its
familiar
graphic
and
phone
number
was
a
reminder
that
only
a
day
before
i
been
a
free
man
in
a
free
country
and
that
now
i
was
a
prisoner
i
worried
constantly
about
darryl
and
fretted
about
my
other
friends
maybe
they
been
more
cooperative
and
had
been
released
maybe
they
told
my
parents
and
they
were
frantically
calling
around
maybe
not
the
cell
was
fantastically
spare
empty
as
my
soul
i
fantasized
that
the
wall
opposite
my
bunk
was
a
screen
that
i
could
be
hacking
right
now
opening
the
i
fantasized
about
my
workbench
and
the
projects
there
the
old
cans
i
was
turning
into
a
ghetto
rig
the
aerial
photography
i
was
building
my
homebrew
laptop
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
there
i
wanted
to
go
home
and
have
my
friends
and
my
school
and
my
parents
and
my
life
back
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
go
where
i
wanted
to
go
not
be
stuck
pacing
and
pacing
and
pacing
they
took
my
passwords
for
my
usb
keys
next
those
held
some
interesting
messages
i
downloaded
from
one
online
discussion
group
or
another
some
chat
transcripts
things
where
people
had
helped
me
out
with
some
of
the
knowledge
i
needed
to
do
the
things
i
did
there
was
nothing
on
there
you
could
find
with
google
of
course
but
i
did
think
that
would
count
in
my
favor
i
got
exercise
again
that
afternoon
and
this
time
there
were
others
in
the
yard
when
i
got
there
four
other
guys
and
two
women
of
all
ages
and
racial
backgrounds
i
guess
lots
of
people
were
doing
things
to
earn
their
privileges
they
gave
me
half
an
hour
and
i
tried
to
make
conversation
with
the
most
of
the
other
prisoners
a
black
guy
about
my
age
with
a
short
afro
but
when
i
introduced
myself
and
stuck
my
hand
out
he
cut
his
eyes
toward
the
cameras
mounted
ominously
in
the
corners
of
the
yard
and
kept
walking
without
ever
changing
his
facial
expression
but
then
just
before
they
called
my
name
and
brought
me
back
into
the
building
the
door
opened
and
out
came
vanessa
i
never
been
more
glad
to
see
a
friendly
face
she
looked
tired
and
grumpy
but
not
hurt
and
when
she
saw
me
she
shouted
my
name
and
ran
to
me
we
hugged
each
other
hard
and
i
realized
i
was
shaking
then
i
realized
she
was
shaking
too
are
you
ok
she
said
holding
me
at
arms
length
i
ok
i
said
they
told
me
they
let
me
go
if
i
gave
them
my
passwords
they
keep
asking
me
questions
about
you
and
darryl
there
was
a
voice
blaring
over
the
loudspeaker
shouting
at
us
to
stop
talking
to
walk
but
we
ignored
it
answer
them
i
said
instantly
anything
they
ask
answer
them
if
it
get
you
out
how
are
darryl
and
jolu
i
have
seen
them
the
door
banged
open
and
four
big
guards
boiled
out
two
took
me
and
two
took
vanessa
they
forced
me
to
the
ground
and
turned
my
head
away
from
vanessa
though
i
heard
her
getting
the
same
treatment
plastic
cuffs
went
around
my
wrists
and
then
i
was
yanked
to
my
feet
and
brought
back
to
my
cell
no
dinner
came
that
night
no
breakfast
came
the
next
morning
no
one
came
and
brought
me
to
the
interrogation
room
to
extract
more
of
my
secrets
the
plastic
cuffs
did
come
off
and
my
shoulders
burned
then
ached
then
went
numb
then
burned
again
i
lost
all
feeling
in
my
hands
i
had
to
pee
i
could
undo
my
pants
i
really
really
had
to
pee
i
pissed
myself
they
came
for
me
after
that
once
the
hot
piss
had
cooled
and
gone
clammy
making
my
already
filthy
jeans
stick
to
my
legs
they
came
for
me
and
walked
me
down
the
long
hall
lined
with
doors
each
door
with
its
own
bar
code
each
bar
code
a
prisoner
like
me
they
walked
me
down
the
corridor
and
brought
me
to
the
interrogation
room
and
it
was
like
a
different
planet
when
i
entered
there
a
world
where
things
were
normal
where
everything
did
reek
of
urine
i
felt
so
dirty
and
ashamed
and
all
those
feelings
of
deserving
what
i
got
came
back
to
me
severe
haircut
lady
was
already
sitting
she
was
perfect
coifed
and
with
just
a
little
makeup
i
smelled
her
hair
stuff
she
wrinkled
her
nose
at
me
i
felt
the
shame
rise
in
me
well
you
been
a
very
naughty
boy
have
you
are
you
a
filthy
thing
shame
i
looked
down
at
the
table
i
could
bear
to
look
up
i
wanted
to
tell
her
my
email
password
and
get
gone
what
did
you
and
your
friend
talk
about
in
the
yard
i
barked
a
laugh
at
the
table
i
told
her
to
answer
your
questions
i
told
her
to
cooperate
so
do
you
give
the
orders
i
felt
the
blood
sing
in
my
ears
oh
come
on
i
said
we
play
a
together
it
called
harajuku
fun
madness
i
the
we
not
terrorists
we
high
school
students
i
do
give
her
orders
i
told
her
that
we
needed
to
be
with
you
so
that
we
could
clear
up
any
suspicion
and
get
out
of
here
she
did
say
anything
for
a
moment
how
is
darryl
i
said
who
darryl
you
picked
us
up
together
my
friend
someone
had
stabbed
him
in
the
powell
street
bart
that
why
we
were
up
on
the
surface
to
get
him
help
i
sure
he
fine
then
she
said
my
stomach
knotted
and
i
almost
threw
up
you
do
you
have
got
him
here
who
we
have
here
and
who
we
do
have
here
is
not
something
we
going
to
discuss
with
you
ever
that
not
something
you
going
to
know
marcus
you
seen
what
happens
when
you
do
cooperate
with
us
you
seen
what
happens
when
you
disobey
our
orders
you
been
a
little
cooperative
and
it
gotten
you
almost
to
the
point
where
you
might
go
free
again
if
you
want
to
make
that
possibility
into
a
reality
you
stick
to
answering
my
questions
i
did
say
anything
you
learning
that
good
now
your
email
passwords
please
i
was
ready
for
this
i
gave
them
everything
server
address
login
password
this
did
matter
i
did
keep
any
email
on
my
server
i
downloaded
it
all
and
kept
it
on
my
laptop
at
home
which
downloaded
and
deleted
my
mail
from
the
server
every
sixty
seconds
they
would
get
anything
out
of
my
mail
it
got
cleared
off
the
server
and
stored
on
my
laptop
at
home
back
to
the
cell
but
they
cut
loose
my
hands
and
they
gave
me
a
shower
and
a
pair
of
orange
prison
pants
to
wear
they
were
too
big
for
me
and
hung
down
low
on
my
hips
like
a
mexican
in
the
mission
that
where
the
look
comes
from
you
know
that
from
prison
i
tell
you
what
it
less
fun
when
it
not
a
fashion
statement
they
took
away
my
jeans
and
i
spent
another
day
in
the
cell
the
walls
were
scratched
cement
over
a
steel
grid
you
could
tell
because
the
steel
was
rusting
in
the
salt
air
and
the
grid
shone
through
the
green
paint
in
my
parents
were
out
that
window
somewhere
they
came
for
me
again
the
next
day
we
been
reading
your
mail
for
a
day
now
we
changed
the
password
so
that
your
home
computer
could
fetch
it
well
of
course
they
had
i
would
have
done
the
same
now
that
i
thought
of
it
we
have
enough
on
you
now
to
put
you
away
for
a
very
long
time
marcus
your
possession
of
these
articles
she
gestured
at
all
my
little
gizmos
and
the
data
we
recovered
from
your
phone
and
memory
sticks
as
well
as
the
subversive
material
we
no
doubt
find
if
we
raided
your
house
and
took
your
computer
it
enough
to
put
you
away
until
you
an
old
man
do
you
understand
that
i
did
believe
it
for
a
second
there
no
way
a
judge
would
say
that
all
this
stuff
constituted
any
kind
of
real
crime
it
was
free
speech
it
was
technological
tinkering
it
was
a
crime
but
who
said
that
these
people
would
ever
put
me
in
front
of
a
judge
we
know
where
you
live
we
know
who
your
friends
are
we
know
how
you
operate
and
how
you
think
it
dawned
on
me
then
they
were
about
to
let
me
go
the
room
seemed
to
brighten
i
heard
myself
breathing
short
little
breaths
we
just
want
to
know
one
thing
what
was
the
delivery
mechanism
for
the
bombs
on
the
bridge
i
stopped
breathing
the
room
darkened
again
what
there
were
ten
charges
on
the
bridge
all
along
its
length
they
were
in
they
been
placed
there
who
placed
them
there
and
how
did
they
get
there
what
i
said
it
again
this
is
your
last
chance
marcus
she
said
she
looked
sad
you
were
doing
so
well
until
now
tell
us
this
and
you
can
go
home
you
can
get
a
lawyer
and
defend
yourself
in
a
court
of
law
there
are
doubtless
extenuating
circumstances
that
you
can
use
to
explain
your
actions
just
tell
us
this
thing
and
you
gone
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
was
crying
and
i
did
even
care
sobbing
blubbering
i
have
idea
what
you
talking
she
shook
her
head
marcus
please
let
us
help
you
by
now
you
know
that
we
always
get
what
we
after
there
was
a
gibbering
sound
in
the
back
of
my
mind
they
were
i
pulled
myself
together
working
hard
to
stop
the
tears
listen
lady
this
is
nuts
you
been
into
my
stuff
you
seen
it
all
i
a
seventeen
year
old
high
school
student
not
a
terrorist
you
ca
seriously
think
marcus
have
you
figured
out
that
we
serious
yet
she
shook
her
head
you
get
pretty
good
grades
i
thought
you
be
smarter
than
that
she
made
a
flicking
gesture
and
the
guards
picked
me
up
by
the
armpits
back
in
my
cell
a
hundred
little
speeches
occurred
to
me
the
french
call
this
esprit
the
spirit
of
the
staircase
the
snappy
rebuttals
that
come
to
you
after
you
leave
the
room
and
slink
down
the
stairs
in
my
mind
i
stood
and
delivered
telling
her
that
i
was
a
citizen
who
loved
my
freedom
which
made
me
the
patriot
and
made
her
the
traitor
in
my
mind
i
shamed
her
for
turning
my
country
into
an
armed
camp
in
my
mind
i
was
eloquent
and
brilliant
and
reduced
her
to
tears
but
you
know
what
none
of
those
fine
words
came
back
to
me
when
they
pulled
me
out
the
next
day
all
i
could
think
of
was
freedom
my
parents
hello
marcus
she
said
how
are
you
feeling
i
looked
down
at
the
table
she
had
a
neat
pile
of
documents
in
front
of
her
and
her
ubiquitous
of
starbucks
beside
her
i
found
it
comforting
somehow
a
reminder
that
there
was
a
real
world
out
there
somewhere
beyond
the
walls
we
through
investigating
you
for
now
she
let
that
hang
there
maybe
it
meant
that
she
was
letting
me
go
maybe
it
meant
that
she
was
going
to
throw
me
in
a
pit
and
forget
that
i
existed
and
i
said
finally
and
i
want
you
to
impress
on
you
again
that
we
are
very
serious
about
this
our
country
has
experienced
the
worst
attack
ever
committed
on
its
soil
how
many
do
you
want
us
to
suffer
before
you
willing
to
cooperate
the
details
of
our
investigation
are
secret
we
wo
stop
at
anything
in
our
efforts
to
bring
the
perpetrators
of
these
heinous
crimes
to
justice
do
you
understand
that
yes
i
mumbled
we
are
going
to
send
you
home
today
but
you
are
a
marked
man
you
have
not
been
found
to
be
above
suspicion
we
only
releasing
you
because
we
done
questioning
you
for
now
but
from
now
on
you
to
us
we
will
be
watching
you
we
be
waiting
for
you
to
make
a
misstep
do
you
understand
that
we
can
watch
you
closely
all
the
time
yes
i
mumbled
good
you
will
never
speak
of
what
happened
here
to
anyone
ever
this
is
a
matter
of
national
security
do
you
know
that
the
death
penalty
still
holds
for
treason
in
time
of
war
yes
i
mumbled
good
boy
she
purred
we
have
some
papers
here
for
you
to
sign
she
pushed
the
stack
of
papers
across
the
table
to
me
little
with
sign
here
printed
on
them
had
been
stuck
throughout
them
a
guard
undid
my
cuffs
i
paged
through
the
papers
and
my
eyes
watered
and
my
head
swam
i
could
make
sense
of
them
i
tried
to
decipher
the
legalese
it
seemed
that
i
was
signing
a
declaration
that
i
had
been
voluntarily
held
and
submitted
to
voluntary
questioning
of
my
own
free
will
what
happens
if
i
do
sign
this
i
said
she
snatched
the
papers
back
and
made
that
flicking
gesture
again
the
guards
jerked
me
to
my
feet
wait
i
cried
please
i
sign
them
they
dragged
me
to
the
door
all
i
could
see
was
that
door
all
i
could
think
of
was
it
closing
behind
me
i
lost
it
i
wept
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
sign
the
papers
to
be
so
close
to
freedom
and
have
it
snatched
away
it
made
me
ready
to
do
anything
i
ca
count
the
number
of
times
i
heard
someone
say
oh
i
rather
die
than
do
i
said
it
myself
now
and
again
but
that
was
the
first
time
i
understood
what
it
really
meant
i
would
have
rather
died
than
go
back
to
my
cell
i
begged
as
they
took
me
out
into
the
corridor
i
told
them
i
sign
anything
she
called
out
to
the
guards
and
they
stopped
they
brought
me
back
they
sat
me
down
one
of
them
put
the
pen
in
my
hand
of
course
i
signed
and
signed
and
signed
my
jeans
and
were
back
in
my
cell
laundered
and
folded
they
smelled
of
detergent
i
put
them
on
and
washed
my
face
and
sat
on
my
cot
and
stared
at
the
wall
they
taken
everything
from
me
first
my
privacy
then
my
dignity
i
been
ready
to
sign
anything
i
would
have
signed
a
confession
that
said
i
assassinated
abraham
lincoln
i
tried
to
cry
but
it
was
like
my
eyes
were
dry
out
of
tears
they
got
me
again
a
guard
approached
me
with
a
hood
like
the
hood
i
been
put
in
when
they
picked
us
up
whenever
that
was
days
ago
weeks
ago
the
hood
went
over
my
head
and
cinched
tight
at
my
neck
i
was
in
total
darkness
and
the
air
was
stifling
and
stale
i
was
raised
to
my
feet
and
walked
down
corridors
up
stairs
on
gravel
up
a
gangplank
on
a
ship
steel
deck
my
hands
were
chained
behind
me
to
a
railing
i
knelt
on
the
deck
and
listened
to
the
thrum
of
the
diesel
engines
the
ship
moved
a
hint
of
salt
air
made
its
way
into
the
hood
it
was
drizzling
and
my
clothes
were
heavy
with
water
i
was
outside
even
if
my
head
was
in
a
bag
i
was
outside
in
the
world
moments
from
my
freedom
they
came
for
me
and
led
me
off
the
boat
and
over
uneven
ground
up
three
metal
stairs
my
wrists
were
unshackled
my
hood
was
removed
i
was
back
in
the
truck
severe
haircut
woman
was
there
at
the
little
desk
she
sat
at
before
she
had
a
ziploc
bag
with
her
and
inside
it
were
my
phone
and
other
little
devices
my
wallet
and
the
change
from
my
pockets
she
handed
them
to
me
wordlessly
i
filled
my
pockets
it
felt
so
weird
to
have
everything
back
in
its
familiar
place
to
be
wearing
my
familiar
clothes
outside
the
truck
back
door
i
heard
the
familiar
sounds
of
my
familiar
city
a
guard
passed
me
my
backpack
the
woman
extended
her
hand
to
me
i
just
looked
at
it
she
put
it
down
and
gave
me
a
wry
smile
then
she
mimed
zipping
up
her
lips
and
pointed
to
me
and
opened
the
door
it
was
daylight
outside
gray
and
drizzling
i
was
looking
down
an
alley
toward
cars
and
trucks
and
bikes
zipping
down
the
road
i
stood
transfixed
on
the
truck
top
step
staring
at
freedom
my
knees
shook
i
knew
now
that
they
were
playing
with
me
again
in
a
moment
the
guards
would
grab
me
and
drag
me
back
inside
the
bag
would
go
over
my
head
again
and
i
would
be
back
on
the
boat
and
sent
off
to
the
prison
again
to
the
endless
unanswerable
questions
i
barely
held
myself
back
from
stuffing
my
fist
in
my
mouth
then
i
forced
myself
to
go
down
one
stair
another
stair
the
last
stair
my
sneakers
crunched
down
on
the
crap
on
the
alley
floor
broken
glass
a
needle
gravel
i
took
a
step
another
i
reached
the
mouth
of
the
alley
and
stepped
onto
the
sidewalk
no
one
grabbed
me
i
was
free
then
strong
arms
threw
themselves
around
me
i
nearly
cried
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
secret
headquarters
in
los
angeles
my
favorite
comic
store
in
the
world
it
small
and
selective
about
what
it
stocks
and
every
time
i
walk
in
i
walk
out
with
three
or
four
collections
i
never
heard
of
under
my
arm
it
like
the
owners
dave
and
david
have
the
uncanny
ability
to
predict
exactly
what
i
looking
for
and
they
lay
it
out
for
me
seconds
before
i
walk
into
the
store
i
discovered
about
three
quarters
of
my
favorite
comics
by
wandering
into
shq
grabbing
something
interesting
sinking
into
one
of
the
comfy
chairs
and
finding
myself
transported
to
another
world
when
my
second
overclocked
came
out
they
worked
with
local
illustrator
martin
cenreda
to
do
a
free
based
on
printcrime
the
first
story
in
the
book

left

about
a
year
ago
and
of
all
the
things
i
miss

ca
but
it
was
van
and
she
crying
and
hugging
me
so
hard
i
could
breathe
i
did
care
i
hugged
her
back
my
face
buried
in
her
hair
you
ok
she
said
i
ok
i
managed
she
finally
let
go
of
me
and
another
set
of
arms
wrapped
themselves
around
me
it
was
jolu
they
were
both
there
he
whispered
you
safe
bro
in
my
ear
and
hugged
me
even
tighter
than
vanessa
had
when
he
let
go
i
looked
around
where
darryl
i
asked
they
both
looked
at
each
other
maybe
he
still
in
the
truck
jolu
said
we
turned
and
looked
at
the
truck
at
the
alley
end
it
was
a
nondescript
white
someone
had
already
brought
the
little
folding
staircase
inside
the
rear
lights
glowed
red
and
the
truck
rolled
backwards
towards
us
emitting
a
steady
eep
eep
eep
wait
i
shouted
as
it
accelerated
towards
us
wait
what
about
darryl
the
truck
drew
closer
i
kept
shouting
what
about
darryl
jolu
and
vanessa
each
had
me
by
an
arm
and
were
dragging
me
away
i
struggled
against
them
shouting
the
truck
pulled
out
of
the
alley
mouth
and
reversed
into
the
street
and
pointed
itself
downhill
and
drove
away
i
tried
to
run
after
it
but
van
and
jolu
would
let
me
go
i
sat
down
on
the
sidewalk
and
put
my
arms
around
my
knees
and
cried
i
cried
and
cried
and
cried
loud
sobs
of
the
sort
i
had
done
since
i
was
a
little
kid
they
would
stop
coming
i
could
stop
shaking
vanessa
and
jolu
got
me
to
my
feet
and
moved
me
a
little
ways
up
the
street
there
was
a
muni
bus
stop
with
a
bench
and
they
sat
me
on
it
they
were
both
crying
too
and
we
held
each
other
for
a
while
and
i
knew
we
were
crying
for
darryl
whom
none
of
us
ever
expected
to
see
again
we
were
north
of
chinatown
at
the
part
where
it
starts
to
become
north
beach
a
neighborhood
with
a
bunch
of
neon
strip
clubs
and
the
legendary
city
lights
counterculture
bookstore
where
the
beat
poetry
movement
had
been
founded
back
in
the
i
knew
this
part
of
town
well
my
parents
favorite
italian
restaurant
was
here
and
they
liked
to
take
me
here
for
big
plates
of
linguine
and
huge
italian
mountains
with
candied
figs
and
lethal
little
espressos
afterward
now
it
was
a
different
place
a
place
where
i
was
tasting
freedom
for
the
first
time
in
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
we
checked
our
pockets
and
found
enough
money
to
get
a
table
at
one
of
the
italian
restaurants
out
on
the
sidewalk
under
an
awning
the
pretty
waitress
lighted
a
with
a
barbeque
lighter
took
our
orders
and
went
inside
the
sensation
of
giving
orders
of
controlling
my
destiny
was
the
most
amazing
thing
i
ever
felt
how
long
were
we
in
there
i
asked
six
days
vanessa
said
i
got
five
jolu
said
i
did
count
what
did
they
do
to
you
vanessa
said
i
did
want
to
talk
about
it
but
they
were
both
looking
at
me
once
i
started
i
could
stop
i
told
them
everything
even
when
i
been
forced
to
piss
myself
and
they
took
it
all
in
silently
i
paused
when
the
waitress
delivered
our
sodas
and
waited
until
she
got
out
of
earshot
then
finished
in
the
telling
it
receded
into
the
distance
by
the
end
of
it
i
could
tell
if
i
was
embroidering
the
truth
or
if
i
was
making
it
all
seem
bad
my
memories
swam
like
little
fish
that
i
snatched
at
and
sometimes
they
wriggled
out
of
my
grasp
jolu
shook
his
head
they
were
hard
on
you
dude
he
said
he
told
us
about
his
stay
there
they
questioned
him
mostly
about
me
and
he
kept
on
telling
them
the
truth
sticking
to
a
plain
telling
of
the
facts
about
that
day
and
about
our
friendship
they
had
gotten
him
to
repeat
it
over
and
over
again
but
they
had
played
games
with
his
head
the
way
they
had
with
me
he
eaten
his
meals
in
a
with
a
bunch
of
other
people
and
been
given
time
in
a
tv
room
where
they
were
shown
last
year
blockbusters
on
video
vanessa
story
was
only
slightly
different
after
she
gotten
them
angry
by
talking
to
me
they
taken
away
her
clothes
and
made
her
wear
a
set
of
orange
prison
overalls
she
been
left
in
her
cell
for
two
days
without
contact
though
she
been
fed
regularly
but
mostly
it
was
the
same
as
jolu
the
same
questions
repeated
again
and
again
they
really
hated
you
jolu
said
really
had
it
in
for
you
why
i
could
imagine
why
then
i
remembered
can
cooperate
or
you
can
be
very
very
sorry
it
was
because
i
would
unlock
my
phone
for
them
that
first
night
that
why
they
singled
me
out
i
could
believe
it
but
there
was
no
other
explanation
it
had
been
sheer
vindictiveness
my
mind
reeled
at
the
thought
they
had
done
all
that
as
a
mere
punishment
for
defying
their
authority
i
had
been
scared
now
i
was
angry
those
bastards
i
said
softly
they
did
it
to
get
back
at
me
for
mouthing
off
jolu
swore
and
then
vanessa
cut
loose
in
korean
something
she
only
did
when
she
was
really
really
angry
i
going
to
get
them
i
whispered
staring
at
my
soda
i
going
to
get
them
jolu
shook
his
head
you
ca
you
know
you
ca
fight
back
against
that
none
of
us
much
wanted
to
talk
about
revenge
then
instead
we
talked
about
what
we
would
do
next
we
had
to
go
home
our
phones
batteries
were
dead
and
it
had
been
years
since
this
neighborhood
had
any
payphones
we
just
needed
to
go
home
i
even
thought
about
taking
a
taxi
but
there
was
enough
money
between
us
to
make
that
possible
so
we
walked
on
the
corner
we
pumped
some
quarters
into
a
san
francisco
chronicle
newspaper
box
and
stopped
to
read
the
front
section
it
had
been
five
days
since
the
bombs
went
off
but
it
was
still
all
over
the
front
cover
severe
haircut
woman
had
talked
about
the
bridge
blowing
up
and
i
just
assumed
that
she
was
talking
about
the
golden
gate
bridge
but
i
was
wrong
the
terrorists
had
blown
up
the
why
the
hell
would
they
blow
up
the
bay
bridge
i
said
the
golden
gate
is
the
one
on
all
the
postcards
even
if
you
never
been
to
san
francisco
chances
are
you
know
what
the
golden
gate
looks
like
it
that
big
orange
suspension
bridge
that
swoops
dramatically
from
the
old
military
base
called
the
presidio
to
sausalito
where
all
the
cutesy
towns
are
with
their
scented
candle
shops
and
art
galleries
it
picturesque
as
hell
and
it
practically
the
symbol
for
the
state
of
california
if
you
go
to
the
disneyland
california
adventure
park
there
a
replica
of
it
just
past
the
gates
with
a
monorail
running
over
it
so
naturally
i
assumed
that
if
you
were
going
to
blow
up
a
bridge
in
san
francisco
that
the
one
you
blow
they
probably
got
scared
off
by
all
the
cameras
and
stuff
jolu
said
the
national
guard
always
checking
cars
at
both
ends
and
there
all
those
suicide
fences
and
junk
all
along
it
people
have
been
jumping
off
the
golden
gate
since
it
opened
in
they
stopped
counting
after
the
thousandth
suicide
in
yeah
vanessa
said
plus
the
bay
bridge
actually
goes
somewhere
the
bay
bridge
goes
from
downtown
san
francisco
to
oakland
and
thence
to
berkeley
the
east
bay
townships
that
are
home
to
many
of
the
people
who
live
and
work
in
town
it
one
of
the
only
parts
of
the
bay
area
where
a
normal
person
can
afford
a
house
big
enough
to
really
stretch
out
in
and
there
also
the
university
and
a
bunch
of
light
industry
over
there
the
bart
goes
under
the
bay
and
connects
the
two
cities
too
but
it
the
bay
bridge
that
sees
most
of
the
traffic
the
golden
gate
was
a
nice
bridge
if
you
were
a
tourist
or
a
rich
retiree
living
out
in
wine
country
but
it
was
mostly
ornamental
the
bay
bridge
is
was
san
francisco
bridge
i
thought
about
it
for
a
minute
you
guys
are
right
i
said
but
i
do
think
that
all
of
it
we
keep
acting
like
terrorists
attack
landmarks
because
they
hate
landmarks
terrorists
do
hate
landmarks
or
bridges
or
airplanes
they
just
want
to
screw
stuff
up
and
make
people
scared
to
make
terror
so
of
course
they
went
after
the
bay
bridge
after
the
golden
gate
got
all
those
cameras
after
airplanes
got
all
and
i
thought
about
it
some
more
staring
blankly
at
the
cars
rolling
down
the
street
at
the
people
walking
down
the
sidewalks
at
the
city
all
around
me
terrorists
do
hate
airplanes
or
bridges
they
love
terror
it
was
so
obvious
i
could
believe
i
never
thought
of
it
before
i
guess
that
being
treated
like
a
terrorist
for
a
few
days
was
enough
to
clarify
my
thinking
the
other
two
were
staring
at
me
i
right
are
i
all
this
crap
all
the
and
id
checks
they
all
useless
are
they
they
nodded
slowly
worse
than
useless
i
said
my
voice
going
up
and
cracking
because
they
ended
up
with
us
in
prison
with
darryl
i
had
thought
of
darryl
since
we
sat
down
and
now
it
came
back
to
me
my
friend
missing
disappeared
i
stopped
talking
and
ground
my
jaws
together
we
have
to
tell
our
parents
jolu
said
we
should
get
a
lawyer
vanessa
said
i
thought
of
telling
my
story
of
telling
the
world
what
had
become
of
me
of
the
videos
that
would
no
doubt
come
out
of
me
weeping
reduced
to
a
groveling
animal
we
ca
tell
them
anything
i
said
without
thinking
what
do
you
mean
van
said
we
ca
tell
them
anything
i
repeated
you
heard
her
if
we
talk
they
come
back
for
us
they
do
to
us
what
they
did
to
darryl
you
joking
jolu
said
you
want
us
to
i
want
us
to
fight
back
i
said
i
want
to
stay
free
so
that
i
can
do
that
if
we
go
out
there
and
blab
they
just
say
that
we
kids
making
it
up
we
do
even
know
where
we
were
held
no
one
will
believe
us
then
one
day
they
come
for
us
i
telling
my
parents
that
i
was
in
one
of
those
camps
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
i
came
over
to
meet
you
guys
there
and
we
got
stranded
and
just
got
loose
today
they
said
in
the
papers
that
people
were
still
wandering
home
from
them
i
ca
do
that
vanessa
said
after
what
they
did
to
you
how
can
you
even
think
of
doing
that
it
happened
to
that
the
point
this
is
me
and
them
now
i
beat
them
i
get
darryl
i
not
going
to
take
this
lying
down
but
once
our
parents
are
involved
that
it
for
us
no
one
will
believe
us
and
no
one
will
care
if
we
do
it
my
way
people
will
care
what
your
way
jolu
said
what
your
plan
i
do
know
yet
i
admitted
give
me
until
tomorrow
morning
give
me
that
at
least
i
knew
that
once
they
kept
it
a
secret
for
a
day
it
would
have
to
be
a
secret
forever
our
parents
would
be
even
more
skeptical
if
we
suddenly
remembered
that
we
been
held
in
a
secret
prison
instead
of
taken
care
of
in
a
refugee
camp
van
and
jolu
looked
at
each
other
i
just
asking
for
a
chance
i
said
we
work
out
the
story
on
the
way
get
it
straight
give
me
one
day
just
one
day
the
other
two
nodded
glumly
and
we
set
off
downhill
again
heading
back
towards
home
i
lived
on
potrero
hill
vanessa
lived
in
the
north
mission
and
jolu
lived
in
noe
valley
three
wildly
different
neighborhoods
just
a
few
minutes
walk
from
one
another
we
turned
onto
market
street
and
stopped
dead
the
street
was
barricaded
at
every
corner
the
reduced
to
a
single
lane
and
parked
down
the
whole
length
of
market
street
were
big
nondescript
like
the
one
that
had
carried
us
hooded
away
from
the
ship
docks
and
to
chinatown
each
one
had
three
steel
steps
leading
down
from
the
back
and
they
buzzed
with
activity
as
soldiers
people
in
suits
and
cops
went
in
and
out
of
them
the
suits
wore
little
badges
on
their
lapels
and
the
soldiers
scanned
them
as
they
went
in
and
out
wireless
authorization
badges
as
we
walked
past
one
i
got
a
look
at
it
and
saw
the
familiar
logo
department
of
homeland
security
the
soldier
saw
me
staring
and
stared
back
hard
glaring
at
me
i
got
the
message
and
moved
on
i
peeled
away
from
the
gang
at
van
ness
we
clung
to
each
other
and
cried
and
promised
to
call
each
other
the
walk
back
to
potrero
hill
has
an
easy
route
and
a
hard
route
the
latter
taking
you
over
some
of
the
steepest
hills
in
the
city
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
see
car
chases
on
in
action
movies
with
cars
catching
air
as
they
soar
over
the
zenith
i
always
take
the
hard
way
home
it
all
residential
streets
and
the
old
victorian
houses
they
call
painted
ladies
for
their
gaudy
elaborate
and
front
gardens
with
scented
flowers
and
tall
grasses
housecats
stare
at
you
from
hedges
and
there
are
hardly
any
homeless
it
was
so
quiet
on
those
streets
that
it
made
me
wish
i
taken
the
route
through
the
mission
which
is
is
probably
the
best
word
for
it
loud
and
vibrant
lots
of
rowdy
drunks
and
angry
and
unconscious
junkies
and
also
lots
of
families
with
strollers
old
ladies
gossiping
on
stoops
lowriders
with
going
down
the
streets
there
were
hipsters
and
mopey
emo
and
even
a
couple
old
guys
with
pot
bellies
bulging
out
beneath
their
dead
kennedys
shirts
also
drag
queens
angry
gang
kids
graffiti
artists
and
bewildered
gentrifiers
trying
not
to
get
killed
while
their
investments
matured
i
went
up
goat
hill
and
walked
past
goat
hill
pizza
which
made
me
think
of
the
jail
i
been
held
in
and
i
had
to
sit
down
on
the
bench
out
front
of
the
restaurant
until
my
shakes
passed
then
i
noticed
the
truck
up
the
hill
from
me
a
nondescript
with
three
metal
steps
coming
down
from
the
back
end
i
got
up
and
got
moving
i
felt
the
eyes
watching
me
from
all
directions
i
hurried
the
rest
of
the
way
home
i
did
look
at
the
painted
ladies
or
the
gardens
or
the
housecats
i
kept
my
eyes
down
both
my
parents
cars
were
in
the
driveway
even
though
it
was
the
middle
of
the
day
of
course
dad
works
in
the
east
bay
so
he
be
stuck
at
home
while
they
worked
on
the
bridge
mom
well
who
knew
why
mom
was
home
they
were
home
for
me
even
before
i
finished
unlocking
the
door
it
had
been
jerked
out
of
my
hand
and
flung
wide
there
were
both
of
my
parents
looking
gray
and
haggard
and
staring
at
me
we
stood
there
in
frozen
tableau
for
a
moment
then
they
both
rushed
forward
and
dragged
me
into
the
house
nearly
tripping
me
up
they
were
both
talking
so
loud
and
fast
all
i
could
hear
was
a
wordless
roaring
gabble
and
they
both
hugged
me
and
cried
and
i
cried
too
and
we
just
stood
there
like
that
in
the
little
foyer
crying
and
making
until
we
ran
out
of
steam
and
went
into
the
kitchen
i
did
what
i
always
did
when
i
came
home
got
myself
a
glass
of
water
from
the
filter
in
the
fridge
and
dug
a
couple
cookies
out
of
the
biscuit
barrel
that
mom
sister
had
sent
us
from
england
the
normalcy
of
this
made
my
heart
stop
hammering
my
heart
catching
up
with
my
brain
and
soon
we
were
all
sitting
at
the
table
where
have
you
been
they
both
said
more
or
less
in
unison
i
had
given
this
some
thought
on
the
way
home
i
got
trapped
i
said
in
oakland
i
was
there
with
some
friends
doing
a
project
and
we
were
all
quarantined
for
five
days
yeah
i
said
yeah
it
was
really
bad
i
read
about
the
quarantines
in
the
chronicle
and
i
cribbed
shamelessly
from
the
quotes
they
published
yeah
everyone
who
got
caught
in
the
cloud
they
thought
we
had
been
attacked
with
some
kind
of
and
they
packed
us
into
shipping
containers
in
the
docklands
like
sardines
it
was
really
hot
and
sticky
not
much
food
either
christ
dad
said
his
fists
balling
up
on
the
table
dad
teaches
in
berkeley
three
days
a
week
working
with
a
few
grad
students
in
the
library
science
program
the
rest
of
the
time
he
consults
for
clients
in
city
and
down
the
peninsula
dotcoms
that
are
doing
various
things
with
archives
he
a
librarian
by
profession
but
he
been
a
real
radical
in
the
sixties
and
wrestled
a
little
in
high
school
i
seen
him
get
crazy
angry
now
and
again
i
even
made
him
that
angry
now
and
again
and
he
could
seriously
lose
it
when
he
was
hulking
out
he
once
threw
a
from
ikea
across
my
granddad
whole
lawn
when
it
fell
apart
for
the
fiftieth
time
while
he
was
assembling
it
barbarians
mom
said
she
been
living
in
america
since
she
was
a
teenager
but
she
still
comes
over
all
british
when
she
encounters
american
cops
airport
security
or
homelessness
then
the
word
is
barbarians
and
her
accent
comes
back
strong
we
been
to
london
twice
to
see
her
family
and
i
ca
say
as
it
felt
any
more
civilized
than
san
francisco
just
more
cramped
but
they
let
us
go
and
ferried
us
over
today
i
was
improvising
now
are
you
hurt
mom
said
hungry
sleepy
yeah
a
little
of
all
that
also
dopey
doc
sneezy
and
bashful
we
had
a
family
tradition
of
seven
dwarfs
jokes
they
both
smiled
a
little
but
their
eyes
were
still
wet
i
felt
really
bad
for
them
they
must
have
been
out
of
their
minds
with
worry
i
was
glad
for
a
chance
to
change
the
subject
i
totally
love
to
eat
i
order
a
pizza
from
goat
hill
dad
said
no
not
that
i
said
they
both
looked
at
me
like
i
sprouted
antennae
i
normally
have
a
thing
about
goat
hill
pizza
as
in
i
can
normally
eat
it
like
a
goldfish
eats
his
food
gobbling
until
it
either
runs
out
or
i
pop
i
tried
to
smile
i
just
do
feel
like
pizza
i
said
lamely
let
order
some
curry
ok
thank
heaven
that
san
francisco
is
central
mom
went
to
the
drawer
of
menus
more
normalcy
feeling
like
a
drink
of
water
on
a
dry
sore
throat
and
riffled
through
them
we
spent
a
couple
of
distracting
minutes
going
through
the
menu
from
the
halal
pakistani
place
on
valencia
i
settled
on
a
mixed
tandoori
grill
and
creamed
spinach
with
farmer
cheese
a
salted
mango
lassi
much
better
than
it
sounds
and
little
fried
pastries
in
sugar
syrup
once
the
food
was
ordered
the
questions
started
again
they
heard
from
van
jolu
and
darryl
families
of
course
and
had
tried
to
report
us
missing
the
police
were
taking
names
but
there
were
so
many
displaced
persons
that
they
were
going
to
open
files
on
anyone
unless
they
were
still
missing
after
seven
days
meanwhile
millions
of
sites
had
popped
up
on
the
net
a
couple
of
the
sites
were
old
myspace
clones
that
had
run
out
of
money
and
saw
a
new
lease
on
life
from
all
the
attention
after
all
some
venture
capitalists
had
missing
family
in
the
bay
area
maybe
if
they
were
recovered
the
site
would
attract
some
new
investment
i
grabbed
dad
laptop
and
looked
through
them
they
were
plastered
with
advertising
of
course
and
pictures
of
missing
people
mostly
grad
photos
wedding
pictures
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
pretty
ghoulish
i
found
my
pic
and
saw
that
it
was
linked
to
van
jolu
and
darryl
there
was
a
little
form
for
marking
people
found
and
another
one
for
writing
up
notes
about
other
missing
people
i
filled
in
the
fields
for
me
and
jolu
and
van
and
left
darryl
blank
you
forgot
darryl
dad
said
he
did
like
darryl
much
once
he
figured
out
that
a
couple
inches
were
missing
out
of
one
of
the
bottles
in
his
liquor
cabinet
and
to
my
enduring
shame
i
blamed
it
on
darryl
in
truth
of
course
it
had
been
both
of
us
just
fooling
around
trying
out
during
an
gaming
session
he
was
with
us
i
said
the
lie
tasted
bitter
in
my
mouth
oh
my
god
my
mom
said
she
squeezed
her
hands
together
we
just
assumed
when
you
came
home
that
you
all
been
together
no
i
said
the
lie
growing
no
he
was
supposed
to
meet
us
but
we
never
met
up
he
probably
just
stuck
over
in
berkeley
he
was
going
to
take
the
bart
over
mom
made
a
whimpering
sound
dad
shook
his
head
and
closed
his
eyes
do
you
know
about
the
bart
he
said
i
shook
my
head
i
could
see
where
this
was
going
i
felt
like
the
ground
was
rushing
up
to
me
they
blew
it
up
dad
said
the
bastards
blew
it
up
at
the
same
time
as
the
bridge
that
had
been
on
the
front
page
of
the
chronicle
but
then
a
bart
blowout
under
the
water
would
be
nearly
as
picturesque
as
the
images
of
the
bridge
hanging
in
tatters
and
pieces
over
the
bay
the
bart
tunnel
from
the
embarcadero
in
san
francisco
to
the
west
oakland
station
was
submerged
i
went
back
to
dad
computer
and
surfed
the
headlines
no
one
was
sure
but
the
body
count
was
in
the
thousands
between
the
cars
that
plummeted
feet
to
the
sea
and
the
people
drowned
in
the
trains
the
deaths
were
mounting
one
reporter
claimed
to
have
interviewed
an
identity
counterfeiter
who
helped
dozens
of
people
walk
away
from
their
old
lives
by
simply
vanishing
after
the
attacks
getting
new
id
made
up
and
slipping
away
from
bad
marriages
bad
debts
and
bad
lives
dad
actually
got
tears
in
his
eyes
and
mom
was
openly
crying
they
each
hugged
me
again
patting
me
with
their
hands
as
if
to
assure
themselves
that
i
was
really
there
they
kept
telling
me
they
loved
me
i
told
them
i
loved
them
too
we
had
a
weepy
dinner
and
mom
and
dad
had
each
had
a
couple
glasses
of
wine
which
was
a
lot
for
them
i
told
them
that
i
was
getting
sleepy
which
was
true
and
mooched
up
to
my
room
i
was
going
to
bed
though
i
needed
to
get
online
and
find
out
what
was
going
on
i
needed
to
talk
to
jolu
and
vanessa
i
needed
to
get
working
on
finding
darryl
i
crept
up
to
my
room
and
opened
the
door
i
had
seen
my
old
bed
in
what
felt
like
a
thousand
years
i
lay
down
on
it
and
reached
over
to
my
bedstand
to
grab
my
laptop
i
must
have
not
plugged
it
in
all
the
way
the
electrical
adapter
needed
to
be
jiggled
just
right
so
it
had
slowly
discharged
while
i
was
away
i
plugged
it
back
in
and
gave
it
a
minute
or
two
to
charge
up
before
trying
to
power
it
up
again
i
used
the
time
to
get
undressed
and
throw
my
clothes
in
the
trash
i
never
wanted
to
see
them
again
and
put
on
a
clean
pair
of
boxers
and
a
fresh
the
clothes
straight
out
of
my
drawers
felt
so
familiar
and
comfortable
like
getting
hugged
by
my
parents
i
powered
up
my
laptop
and
punched
a
bunch
of
pillows
into
place
behind
me
at
the
top
of
the
bed
i
scooched
back
and
opened
my
computer
lid
and
settled
it
onto
my
thighs
it
was
still
booting
and
man
those
icons
creeping
across
the
screen
looked
it
came
all
the
way
up
and
then
it
started
giving
me
more
warnings
i
checked
the
again
and
wiggled
it
and
they
went
away
the
was
really
flaking
out
in
fact
it
was
so
bad
that
i
could
actually
get
anything
done
every
time
i
took
my
hand
off
the
it
lost
contact
and
the
computer
started
to
complain
about
its
battery
i
took
a
closer
look
at
it
the
whole
case
of
my
computer
was
slightly
misaligned
the
seam
split
in
an
angular
gape
that
started
narrow
and
widened
toward
the
back
sometimes
you
look
at
a
piece
of
equipment
and
discover
something
like
this
and
you
wonder
was
it
always
like
that
maybe
you
just
never
noticed
but
with
my
laptop
that
was
possible
you
see
i
built
it
after
the
board
of
ed
issued
us
all
with
schoolbooks
there
was
no
way
my
parents
were
going
to
buy
me
a
computer
of
my
own
even
though
technically
the
schoolbook
did
belong
to
me
and
i
was
supposed
to
install
software
on
it
or
mod
it
i
had
some
money
saved
odd
jobs
christmases
and
birthdays
a
little
bit
of
judicious
ebaying
put
it
all
together
and
i
had
enough
money
to
buy
a
totally
crappy
machine
so
darryl
and
i
built
one
instead
you
can
buy
laptop
cases
just
like
you
can
buy
cases
for
desktop
pcs
though
they
a
little
more
specialized
than
plain
old
pcs
i
built
a
couple
pcs
with
darryl
over
the
years
scavenging
parts
from
craigslist
and
garage
sales
and
ordering
stuff
from
cheap
cheap
taiwanese
vendors
we
found
on
the
net
i
figured
that
building
a
laptop
would
be
the
best
way
to
get
the
power
i
wanted
at
the
price
i
could
afford
to
build
your
own
laptop
you
start
by
ordering
a
barebook
a
machine
with
just
a
little
hardware
in
it
and
all
the
right
slots
the
good
news
was
once
i
was
done
i
had
a
machine
that
was
a
whole
pound
lighter
than
the
dell
i
had
my
eye
on
ran
faster
and
cost
a
third
of
what
i
would
have
paid
dell
the
bad
news
was
that
assembling
a
laptop
is
like
building
one
of
those
ships
in
a
bottle
it
all
finicky
work
with
tweezers
and
magnifying
glasses
trying
to
get
everything
to
fit
in
that
little
case
unlike
a
pc
which
is
mostly
air
every
cubic
millimeter
of
space
in
a
laptop
is
spoken
for
every
time
i
thought
i
had
it
i
go
to
screw
the
thing
back
together
and
find
that
something
was
keeping
the
case
from
closing
all
the
way
and
it
be
back
to
the
drawing
board
so
i
knew
how
the
seam
on
my
laptop
was
supposed
to
look
when
the
thing
was
closed
and
it
was
supposed
to
look
like
this
i
kept
jiggling
the
but
it
was
hopeless
there
was
no
way
i
was
going
to
get
the
thing
to
boot
without
taking
it
apart
i
groaned
and
put
it
beside
the
bed
i
deal
with
it
in
the
morning
that
was
the
theory
anyway
two
hours
later
i
was
still
staring
at
the
ceiling
playing
back
movies
in
my
head
of
what
they
done
to
me
what
i
should
have
done
all
regrets
and
i
rolled
out
of
bed
it
had
gone
midnight
and
i
heard
my
parents
hit
the
sack
at
eleven
i
grabbed
the
laptop
and
cleared
some
space
on
my
desk
and
clipped
the
little
led
lamps
to
the
temples
of
my
magnifying
glasses
and
pulled
out
a
set
of
little
precision
screwdrivers
a
minute
later
i
had
the
case
open
and
the
keyboard
removed
and
i
was
staring
at
the
guts
of
my
laptop
i
got
a
can
of
compressed
air
and
blew
out
the
dust
that
the
fan
had
sucked
in
and
looked
things
over
something
was
right
i
could
put
my
finger
on
it
but
then
it
had
been
months
since
i
had
the
lid
off
this
thing
luckily
the
third
time
i
had
to
open
it
up
and
struggle
to
close
it
again
i
gotten
smart
i
taken
a
photo
of
the
guts
with
everything
in
place
i
had
been
totally
smart
at
first
i
just
left
that
pic
on
my
hard
drive
and
naturally
i
could
get
to
it
when
i
had
the
laptop
in
parts
but
then
i
printed
it
out
and
stuck
it
in
my
messy
drawer
of
papers
the
graveyard
where
i
kept
all
the
warranty
cards
and
diagrams
i
shuffled
them
they
seemed
messier
than
i
remembered
and
brought
out
my
photo
i
set
it
down
next
to
the
computer
and
kind
of
unfocused
my
eyes
trying
to
find
things
that
looked
out
of
place
then
i
spotted
it
the
ribbon
cable
that
connected
the
keyboard
to
the
was
connected
right
that
was
a
weird
one
there
was
no
torque
on
that
part
nothing
to
dislodge
it
in
the
course
of
normal
operations
i
tried
to
press
it
back
down
again
and
discovered
that
the
plug
was
just
badly
mounted
there
was
something
between
it
and
the
board
i
tweezed
it
out
and
shone
my
light
on
it
there
was
something
new
in
my
keyboard
it
was
a
little
chunk
of
hardware
only
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
thick
with
no
markings
the
keyboard
was
plugged
into
it
and
it
was
plugged
into
the
board
it
other
words
it
was
perfectly
situated
to
capture
all
the
keystrokes
i
made
while
i
typed
on
my
machine
it
was
a
bug
my
heart
thudded
in
my
ears
it
was
dark
and
quiet
in
the
house
but
it
was
a
comforting
dark
there
were
eyes
out
there
eyes
and
ears
and
they
were
watching
me
surveilling
me
the
surveillance
i
faced
at
school
had
followed
me
home
but
this
time
it
was
just
the
board
of
education
looking
over
my
shoulder
the
department
of
homeland
security
had
joined
them
i
almost
took
the
bug
out
then
i
figured
that
who
ever
put
it
there
would
know
that
it
was
gone
i
left
it
in
it
made
me
sick
to
do
it
i
looked
around
for
more
tampering
i
could
find
any
but
did
that
mean
there
had
been
any
someone
had
broken
into
my
room
and
planted
this
device
had
disassembled
my
laptop
and
reassembled
it
there
were
lots
of
other
ways
to
wiretap
a
computer
i
could
never
find
them
all
i
put
the
machine
together
with
numb
fingers
this
time
the
case
would
snap
shut
just
right
but
the
stayed
in
i
booted
it
up
and
set
my
fingers
on
the
keyboard
thinking
that
i
would
run
some
diagnostics
and
see
what
was
what
but
i
could
do
it
hell
maybe
my
room
was
wiretapped
maybe
there
was
a
camera
spying
on
me
now
i
been
feeling
paranoid
when
i
got
home
now
i
was
nearly
out
of
my
skin
it
felt
like
i
was
back
in
jail
back
in
the
interrogation
room
stalked
by
entities
who
had
me
utterly
in
their
power
it
made
me
want
to
cry
only
one
thing
for
it
i
went
into
the
bathroom
and
took
off
the
roll
and
replaced
it
with
a
fresh
one
luckily
it
was
almost
empty
already
i
unrolled
the
rest
of
the
paper
and
dug
through
my
parts
box
until
i
found
a
little
plastic
envelope
full
of
white
leds
i
scavenged
out
of
a
dead
i
punched
their
leads
through
the
cardboard
tube
carefully
using
a
pin
to
make
the
holes
then
got
out
some
wire
and
connected
them
all
in
series
with
little
metal
clips
i
twisted
the
wires
into
the
leads
for
a
battery
and
connected
the
battery
now
i
had
a
tube
ringed
with
directional
leds
and
i
could
hold
it
up
to
my
eye
and
look
through
it
i
built
one
of
these
last
year
as
a
science
fair
project
and
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
fair
once
i
showed
that
there
were
hidden
cameras
in
half
the
classrooms
at
chavez
high
pinhead
cost
less
than
a
good
restaurant
dinner
these
days
so
they
showing
up
everywhere
sneaky
store
clerks
put
them
in
changing
rooms
or
tanning
salons
and
get
pervy
with
the
hidden
footage
they
get
from
their
customers
sometimes
they
just
put
it
on
the
net
knowing
how
to
turn
a
roll
and
three
bucks
worth
of
parts
into
a
is
just
good
sense
this
is
the
simplest
way
to
catch
a
they
have
tiny
lenses
but
they
reflect
light
like
the
dickens
it
works
best
in
a
dim
room
stare
through
the
tube
and
slowly
scan
all
the
walls
and
other
places
someone
might
have
put
a
camera
until
you
see
the
glint
of
a
reflection
if
the
reflection
stays
still
as
you
move
around
that
a
lens
there
was
a
camera
in
my
room
not
one
i
could
detect
anyway
there
might
have
been
audio
bugs
of
course
or
better
cameras
or
nothing
at
all
can
you
blame
me
for
feeling
paranoid
i
loved
that
laptop
i
called
it
the
salmagundi
which
means
anything
made
out
of
spare
parts
once
you
get
to
naming
your
laptop
you
know
that
you
really
having
a
deep
relationship
with
it
now
though
i
felt
like
i
did
want
to
ever
touch
it
again
i
wanted
to
throw
it
out
the
window
who
knew
what
they
done
to
it
who
knew
how
it
had
been
tapped
i
put
it
in
a
drawer
with
the
lid
shut
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
it
was
late
and
i
should
be
in
bed
there
was
no
way
i
was
going
to
sleep
now
though
i
was
tapped
everyone
might
be
tapped
the
world
had
changed
forever
i
find
a
way
to
get
them
i
said
it
was
a
vow
i
knew
it
when
i
heard
it
though
i
never
made
a
vow
before
i
could
sleep
after
that
and
besides
i
had
an
idea
somewhere
in
my
closet
was
a
box
containing
one
xbox
universal
every
xbox
has
been
sold
way
below
cost
microsoft
makes
most
of
its
money
charging
games
companies
money
for
the
right
to
put
out
xbox
games
but
the
universal
was
the
first
xbox
that
microsoft
decided
to
give
away
entirely
for
free
last
christmas
season
there
been
poor
losers
on
every
corner
dressed
as
warriors
from
the
halo
series
handing
out
bags
of
these
as
fast
as
they
could
i
guess
it
worked
everyone
says
they
sold
a
whole
of
games
naturally
there
were
countermeasures
to
make
sure
you
only
played
games
from
companies
that
had
bought
licenses
from
microsoft
to
make
them
hackers
blow
through
those
countermeasures
the
xbox
was
cracked
by
a
kid
from
mit
who
wrote
a
book
about
it
and
then
the
went
down
and
then
the
xbox
portable
which
we
all
called
the
luggable
it
weighed
three
pounds
succumbed
the
universal
was
supposed
to
be
totally
bulletproof
the
high
school
kids
who
broke
it
were
brazilian
linux
hackers
who
lived
in
a
a
kind
of
squatter
slum
never
underestimate
the
determination
of
a
kid
who
is
and
once
the
brazilians
published
their
crack
we
all
went
nuts
on
it
soon
there
were
dozens
of
alternate
operating
systems
for
the
xbox
universal
my
favorite
was
paranoidxbox
a
flavor
of
paranoid
linux
paranoid
linux
is
an
operating
system
that
assumes
that
its
operator
is
under
assault
from
the
government
it
was
intended
for
use
by
chinese
and
syrian
dissidents
and
it
does
everything
it
can
to
keep
your
communications
and
documents
a
secret
it
even
throws
up
a
bunch
of
chaff
communications
that
are
supposed
to
disguise
the
fact
that
you
doing
anything
covert
so
while
you
receiving
a
political
message
one
character
at
a
time
paranoidlinux
is
pretending
to
surf
the
web
and
fill
in
questionnaires
and
flirt
in
meanwhile
one
in
every
five
hundred
characters
you
receive
is
your
real
message
a
needle
buried
in
a
huge
haystack
i
burned
a
paranoidxbox
dvd
when
they
first
appeared
but
i
never
gotten
around
to
unpacking
the
xbox
in
my
closet
finding
a
tv
to
hook
it
up
to
and
so
on
my
room
is
crowded
enough
as
it
is
without
letting
microsoft
crashware
eat
up
valuable
workspace
tonight
i
make
the
sacrifice
it
took
about
twenty
minutes
to
get
up
and
running
not
having
a
tv
was
the
hardest
part
but
eventually
i
remembered
that
i
had
a
little
overhead
lcd
projector
that
had
standard
tv
rca
connectors
on
the
back
i
connected
it
to
the
xbox
and
shone
it
on
the
back
of
my
door
and
got
paranoidlinux
installed
now
i
was
up
and
running
and
paranoidlinux
was
looking
for
other
xbox
universals
to
talk
to
every
xbox
universal
comes
with
wireless
for
multiplayer
gaming
you
can
connect
to
your
neighbors
on
the
wireless
link
and
to
the
internet
if
you
have
a
wireless
internet
connection
i
found
three
different
sets
of
neighbors
in
range
two
of
them
had
their
xbox
universals
also
connected
to
the
internet
paranoidxbox
loved
that
configuration
it
could
siphon
off
some
of
my
neighbors
internet
connections
and
use
them
to
get
online
through
the
gaming
network
the
neighbors
would
never
miss
the
packets
they
were
paying
for
internet
connections
and
they
were
exactly
doing
a
lot
of
surfing
at
the
best
part
of
all
this
is
how
it
made
me
in
control
my
technology
was
working
for
me
serving
me
protecting
me
it
was
spying
on
me
this
is
why
i
loved
technology
if
you
used
it
right
it
could
give
you
power
and
privacy
my
brain
was
really
going
now
running
like
there
were
lots
of
reasons
to
run
paranoidxbox
the
best
one
was
that
anyone
could
write
games
for
it
already
there
was
a
port
of
mame
the
multiple
arcade
machine
emulator
so
you
could
play
practically
any
game
that
had
ever
been
written
all
the
way
back
to
pong
games
for
the
apple
and
games
for
the
colecovision
games
for
the
nes
and
the
dreamcast
and
so
on
even
better
were
all
the
cool
multiplayer
games
being
built
specifically
for
paranoidxbox
totally
free
hobbyist
games
that
anyone
could
run
when
you
combined
it
all
you
had
a
free
console
full
of
free
games
that
could
get
you
free
internet
access
and
the
best
part
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
was
that
paranoidxbox
was
every
bit
that
went
over
the
air
was
scrambled
to
within
an
inch
of
its
life
you
could
wiretap
it
all
you
wanted
but
you
never
figure
out
who
was
talking
what
they
were
talking
about
or
who
they
were
talking
to
anonymous
web
email
and
im
just
what
i
needed
all
i
had
to
do
now
was
convince
everyone
i
knew
to
use
it
too
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
powell
books
the
legendary
city
of
books
in
portland
oregon
powell
is
the
largest
bookstore
in
the

endless
universe
of
papery
smells
and
towering
shelves

and
used

on
the
same
shelves

i
always
loved
and
every
time
i
stopped
in

had
a
veritable
mountain
of
my
books

they
been
incredibly
gracious
about
asking
me

believe
it
or
not
my
parents
made
me
go
to
school
the
next
day
i
only
fallen
into
feverish
sleep
at
three
in
the
morning
but
at
seven
the
next
day
my
dad
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
threatening
to
drag
me
out
by
the
ankles
i
managed
to
get
up
something
had
died
in
my
mouth
after
painting
my
eyelids
shut
and
into
the
shower
i
let
my
mom
force
a
piece
of
toast
and
a
banana
into
me
wishing
fervently
that
my
parents
would
let
me
drink
coffee
at
home
i
could
sneak
one
on
the
way
to
school
but
watching
them
sip
down
their
black
gold
while
i
was
around
the
house
getting
dressed
and
putting
my
books
in
my
bag
it
was
awful
i
walked
to
school
a
thousand
times
but
today
it
was
different
i
went
up
and
over
the
hills
to
get
down
into
the
mission
and
everywhere
there
were
trucks
i
saw
new
sensors
and
traffic
cameras
installed
at
many
of
the
someone
had
a
lot
of
surveillance
gear
lying
around
waiting
to
be
installed
at
the
first
opportunity
the
attack
on
the
bay
bridge
had
been
just
what
they
needed
it
all
made
the
city
seem
more
subdued
like
being
inside
an
elevator
embarrassed
by
the
close
scrutiny
of
your
neighbors
and
the
ubiquitous
cameras
the
turkish
coffee
shop
on
street
fixed
me
up
good
with
a
of
turkish
coffee
basically
turkish
coffee
is
mud
pretending
to
be
coffee
it
thick
enough
to
stand
a
spoon
up
in
and
it
has
way
more
caffeine
than
the
like
red
bull
take
it
from
someone
who
read
the
wikipedia
entry
this
is
how
the
ottoman
empire
was
won
maddened
horsemen
fueled
by
lethal
i
pulled
out
my
debit
card
to
pay
and
he
made
a
face
no
more
debit
he
said
huh
why
not
i
paid
for
my
coffee
habit
on
my
card
for
years
at
the
turk
he
used
to
hassle
me
all
the
time
telling
me
i
was
too
young
to
drink
the
stuff
and
he
still
refused
to
serve
me
at
all
during
school
hours
convinced
that
i
was
skipping
class
but
over
the
years
the
turk
and
me
have
developed
a
kind
of
gruff
understanding
he
shook
his
head
sadly
you
would
understand
go
to
school
kid
there
no
surer
way
to
make
me
want
to
understand
than
to
tell
me
i
wo
i
wheedled
him
demanding
that
he
tell
me
he
looked
like
he
was
going
to
throw
me
out
but
when
i
asked
him
if
he
thought
i
was
good
enough
to
shop
there
he
opened
up
the
security
he
said
looking
around
his
little
shop
with
its
tubs
of
dried
beans
and
seeds
its
shelves
of
turkish
groceries
the
government
they
monitor
it
all
now
it
was
in
the
papers
patriot
act
ii
the
congress
passed
it
yesterday
now
they
can
monitor
every
time
you
use
your
card
i
say
no
i
say
my
shop
will
not
help
them
spy
on
my
customers
my
jaw
dropped
you
think
it
no
big
deal
maybe
what
is
the
problem
with
government
knowing
when
you
buy
coffee
because
it
one
way
they
know
where
you
are
where
you
been
why
you
think
i
left
turkey
where
you
have
government
always
spying
on
the
people
is
no
good
i
move
here
twenty
years
ago
for
freedom
i
no
help
them
take
freedom
away
you
going
to
lose
so
many
sales
i
blurted
i
wanted
to
tell
him
he
was
a
hero
and
shake
his
hand
but
that
was
what
came
out
everyone
uses
debit
cards
maybe
not
so
much
anymore
maybe
my
customers
come
here
because
they
know
i
love
freedom
too
i
am
making
sign
for
window
maybe
other
stores
do
the
same
i
hear
the
aclu
will
sue
them
for
this
you
got
all
my
business
from
now
on
i
said
i
meant
it
i
reached
into
my
pocket
um
i
do
have
any
cash
though
he
pursed
his
lips
and
nodded
many
peoples
say
the
same
thing
is
you
give
today
money
to
the
aclu
in
two
minutes
the
turk
and
i
had
exchanged
more
words
than
we
had
in
all
the
time
i
been
coming
to
his
shop
i
had
no
idea
he
had
all
these
passions
i
just
thought
of
him
as
my
friendly
neighborhood
caffeine
dealer
now
i
shook
his
hand
and
when
i
left
his
store
i
felt
like
he
and
i
had
joined
a
team
a
secret
team
i
missed
two
days
of
school
but
it
seemed
like
i
had
missed
much
class
they
shut
the
school
on
one
of
those
days
while
the
city
scrambled
to
recover
the
next
day
had
been
devoted
it
seemed
to
mourning
those
missing
and
presumed
dead
the
newspapers
published
biographies
of
the
lost
personal
memorials
the
web
was
filled
with
these
capsule
obituaries
thousands
of
them
embarrassingly
i
was
one
of
those
people
i
stepped
into
the
schoolyard
not
knowing
this
and
then
there
was
a
shout
and
a
moment
later
there
were
a
hundred
people
around
me
pounding
me
on
the
back
shaking
my
hand
a
couple
girls
i
did
even
know
kissed
me
and
they
were
more
than
friendly
kisses
i
felt
like
a
rock
star
my
teachers
were
only
a
little
more
subdued
ms
galvez
cried
as
much
as
my
mother
had
and
hugged
me
three
times
before
she
let
me
go
to
my
desk
and
sit
down
there
was
something
new
at
the
front
of
the
classroom
a
camera
ms
galvez
caught
me
staring
at
it
and
handed
me
a
permission
slip
on
smeary
xeroxed
school
letterhead
the
board
of
the
san
francisco
unified
school
district
had
held
an
emergency
session
over
the
weekend
and
unanimously
voted
to
ask
the
parents
of
every
kid
in
the
city
for
permission
to
put
closed
circuit
television
cameras
in
every
classroom
and
corridor
the
law
said
they
could
force
us
to
go
to
school
with
cameras
all
over
the
place
but
it
did
say
anything
about
us
to
give
up
our
constitutional
rights
the
letter
said
that
the
board
were
sure
that
they
would
get
complete
compliance
from
the
city
parents
but
that
they
would
make
arrangements
to
teach
those
kids
whose
parents
objected
in
a
separate
set
of
unprotected
classrooms
why
did
we
have
cameras
in
our
classrooms
now
terrorists
of
course
because
by
blowing
up
a
bridge
terrorists
had
indicated
that
schools
were
next
somehow
that
was
the
conclusion
that
the
board
had
reached
anyway
i
read
this
note
three
times
and
then
i
stuck
my
hand
up
yes
marcus
ms
galvez
about
this
note
yes
marcus
is
the
point
of
terrorism
to
make
us
afraid
that
why
it
called
right
i
suppose
so
the
class
was
staring
at
me
i
was
the
best
student
in
school
but
i
did
like
a
good
debate
they
were
waiting
to
hear
what
i
say
next
so
are
we
doing
what
the
terrorists
want
from
us
do
they
win
if
we
act
all
afraid
and
put
cameras
in
the
classrooms
and
all
of
that
there
was
some
nervous
tittering
one
of
the
others
put
his
hand
up
it
was
charles
ms
galvez
called
on
him
putting
cameras
in
makes
us
safe
which
makes
us
less
afraid
safe
from
what
i
said
without
waiting
to
be
called
on
terrorism
charles
said
the
others
were
nodding
their
heads
how
do
they
do
that
if
a
suicide
bomber
rushed
in
here
and
blew
us
all
up
ms
galvez
marcus
is
violating
school
policy
we
not
supposed
to
make
jokes
about
terrorist
attacks
who
making
jokes
thank
you
both
of
you
ms
galvez
said
she
looked
really
unhappy
i
felt
kind
of
bad
for
hijacking
her
class
i
think
that
this
is
a
really
interesting
discussion
but
i
like
to
hold
it
over
for
a
future
class
i
think
that
these
issues
may
be
too
emotional
for
us
to
have
a
discussion
about
them
today
now
let
get
back
to
the
suffragists
shall
we
so
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
hour
talking
about
suffragists
and
the
new
lobbying
strategies
they
devised
for
getting
four
women
into
every
congresscritter
office
to
lean
on
him
and
let
him
know
what
it
would
mean
for
his
political
future
if
he
kept
on
denying
women
the
vote
it
was
normally
the
kind
of
thing
i
really
liked
little
guys
making
the
big
and
powerful
be
honest
but
today
i
could
concentrate
it
must
have
been
darryl
absence
we
both
liked
social
studies
and
we
would
have
had
our
schoolbooks
out
and
an
im
session
up
seconds
after
sitting
down
a
for
talking
about
the
lesson
i
burned
twenty
paranoidxbox
discs
the
night
before
and
i
had
them
all
in
my
bag
i
handed
them
out
to
people
i
knew
were
really
really
into
gaming
they
all
gotten
an
xbox
universal
or
two
the
year
before
but
most
of
them
had
stopped
using
them
the
games
were
really
expensive
and
not
a
lot
of
fun
i
took
them
aside
between
periods
at
lunch
and
study
hall
and
sang
the
praises
of
the
paranoidxbox
games
to
the
sky
free
and
fun
addictive
social
games
with
lots
of
cool
people
playing
them
from
all
over
the
world
giving
away
one
thing
to
sell
another
is
what
they
call
a
razor
blade
business
companies
like
gillette
give
you
free
handles
and
then
stiff
you
by
charging
you
a
small
fortune
for
the
blades
printer
cartridges
are
the
worst
for
that
the
most
expensive
champagne
in
the
world
is
cheap
when
compared
with
inkjet
ink
which
costs
all
of
a
penny
a
gallon
to
make
wholesale
businesses
depend
on
you
not
being
able
to
get
the
blades
from
someone
else
after
all
if
gillette
can
make
nine
bucks
on
a
replacement
blade
why
not
start
a
competitor
that
makes
only
four
bucks
selling
an
identical
blade
an
percent
profit
margin
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
makes
your
average
go
all
drooly
and
so
companies
like
microsoft
pour
a
lot
of
effort
into
making
it
hard
illegal
to
compete
with
them
on
the
blades
in
microsoft
case
every
xbox
has
had
countermeasures
to
keep
you
from
running
software
that
was
released
by
people
who
did
pay
the
microsoft
for
the
right
to
sell
xbox
programs
the
people
i
met
did
think
much
about
this
stuff
they
perked
up
when
i
told
them
that
the
games
were
unmonitored
these
days
any
online
game
you
play
is
filled
with
all
kinds
of
unsavory
sorts
first
there
are
the
pervs
who
try
to
get
you
to
come
out
to
some
remote
location
so
they
can
go
all
weird
and
silence
of
the
lambs
on
you
then
there
are
the
cops
who
are
pretending
to
be
gullible
kids
so
they
can
bust
the
pervs
worst
of
all
though
are
the
monitors
who
spend
all
their
time
spying
on
our
discussions
and
snitching
on
us
for
violating
their
terms
of
service
which
say
no
flirting
no
cussing
and
no
clear
or
masked
language
which
insultingly
refers
to
any
aspect
of
sexual
orientation
or
sexuality
i
no
but
i
a
seventeen
year
old
boy
sex
does
come
up
in
conversation
every
now
and
again
but
god
help
you
if
it
came
up
in
chat
while
you
were
gaming
it
was
a
real
no
one
monitored
the
paranoidxbox
games
because
they
were
run
by
a
company
they
were
just
games
that
hackers
had
written
for
the
hell
of
it
so
these
loved
the
story
they
took
the
discs
greedily
and
promised
to
burn
copies
for
all
of
their
friends
after
all
games
are
most
fun
when
you
playing
them
with
your
buddies
when
i
got
home
i
read
that
a
group
of
parents
were
suing
the
school
board
over
the
surveillance
cameras
in
the
classrooms
but
that
they
already
lost
their
bid
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction
against
them
i
do
know
who
came
up
with
the
name
xnet
but
it
stuck
you
hear
people
talking
about
it
on
the
muni
van
called
me
up
to
ask
me
if
i
heard
of
it
and
i
nearly
choked
once
i
figured
out
what
she
was
talking
about
the
discs
i
started
distributing
last
week
had
been
sneakernetted
and
copied
all
the
way
to
oakland
in
the
space
of
two
weeks
it
made
me
look
over
my
shoulder
like
i
broken
a
rule
and
now
the
dhs
would
come
and
take
me
away
forever
they
been
hard
weeks
the
bart
had
completely
abandoned
cash
fares
now
switching
them
for
arphid
contactless
cards
that
you
waved
at
the
turnstiles
to
go
through
they
were
cool
and
convenient
but
every
time
i
used
one
i
thought
about
how
i
was
being
tracked
someone
on
xnet
posted
a
link
to
an
electronic
frontier
foundation
white
paper
on
the
ways
that
these
things
could
be
used
to
track
people
and
the
paper
had
tiny
stories
about
little
groups
of
people
that
had
protested
at
the
bart
stations
i
used
the
xnet
for
almost
everything
now
i
set
up
a
fake
email
address
through
the
pirate
party
a
swedish
political
party
that
hated
internet
surveillance
and
promised
to
keep
their
mail
accounts
a
secret
from
everyone
even
the
cops
i
accessed
it
strictly
via
xnet
hopping
from
one
neighbor
internet
connection
to
the
next
staying
anonymous
i
hoped
all
the
way
to
sweden
i
was
using
anymore
if
benson
could
figure
it
out
anyone
could
my
new
handle
come
up
with
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
was
and
i
got
a
of
email
from
people
who
heard
in
chat
rooms
and
message
boards
that
i
could
help
them
troubleshoot
their
xnet
configurations
and
connections
i
missed
harajuku
fun
madness
the
company
had
suspended
the
game
indefinitely
they
said
that
for
security
reasons
they
did
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
hide
things
and
then
send
people
off
to
find
them
what
if
someone
thought
it
was
a
bomb
what
if
someone
put
a
bomb
in
the
same
spot
what
if
i
got
hit
by
lightning
while
walking
with
an
umbrella
ban
umbrellas
fight
the
menace
of
lightning
i
kept
on
using
my
laptop
though
i
got
a
feeling
when
i
used
it
whoever
had
wiretapped
it
would
wonder
why
i
did
use
it
i
figured
i
just
do
some
random
surfing
with
it
every
day
a
little
less
each
day
so
that
anyone
watching
would
see
me
slowly
changing
my
habits
not
doing
a
sudden
reversal
mostly
i
read
those
creepy
obits
all
those
thousands
of
my
friends
and
neighbors
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
truth
be
told
i
doing
less
and
less
homework
every
day
i
had
business
elsewhere
i
burned
new
stacks
of
paranoidxbox
every
day
fifty
or
sixty
and
took
them
around
the
city
to
people
i
heard
were
willing
to
burn
sixty
of
their
own
and
hand
them
out
to
their
friends
i
was
too
worried
about
getting
caught
doing
this
because
i
had
good
crypto
on
my
side
crypto
is
cryptography
or
secret
writing
and
it
been
around
since
roman
times
literally
augustus
caesar
was
a
big
fan
and
liked
to
invent
his
own
codes
some
of
which
we
use
today
for
scrambling
joke
punchlines
in
email
crypto
is
math
hard
math
i
not
going
to
try
to
explain
it
in
detail
because
i
do
have
the
math
to
really
get
my
head
around
it
either
look
it
up
on
wikipedia
if
you
really
want
but
here
the
cliff
notes
version
some
kinds
of
mathematical
functions
are
really
easy
to
do
in
one
direction
and
really
hard
to
do
in
the
other
direction
it
easy
to
multiply
two
big
prime
numbers
together
and
make
a
giant
number
it
really
really
hard
to
take
any
given
giant
number
and
figure
out
which
primes
multiply
together
to
give
you
that
number
that
means
that
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
way
of
scrambling
something
based
on
multiplying
large
primes
unscrambling
it
without
knowing
those
primes
will
be
hard
wicked
hard
like
a
trillion
years
of
all
the
computers
ever
invented
working
wo
be
able
to
do
it
there
are
four
parts
to
any
crypto
message
the
original
message
called
the
cleartext
the
scrambled
message
called
the
ciphertext
the
scrambling
system
called
the
cipher
and
finally
there
the
key
secret
stuff
you
feed
into
the
cipher
along
with
the
cleartext
to
make
ciphertext
it
used
to
be
that
crypto
people
tried
to
keep
all
of
this
a
secret
every
agency
and
government
had
its
own
ciphers
its
own
keys
the
nazis
and
the
allies
did
want
the
other
guys
to
know
how
they
scrambled
their
messages
let
alone
the
keys
that
they
could
use
to
descramble
them
that
sounds
like
a
good
idea
right
wrong
the
first
time
anyone
told
me
about
all
this
prime
factoring
stuff
i
immediately
said
no
way
that
bs
i
mean
it
hard
to
do
this
prime
factorization
stuff
whatever
you
say
it
is
but
it
used
to
be
impossible
to
fly
or
go
to
the
moon
or
get
a
with
more
than
a
few
kilobytes
of
storage
someone
have
invented
a
way
of
descrambling
the
messages
i
had
visions
of
a
hollow
mountain
full
of
national
security
agency
mathematicians
reading
every
email
in
the
world
and
snickering
in
fact
that
pretty
much
what
happened
during
world
war
ii
that
the
reason
that
life
is
more
like
castle
wolfenstein
where
i
spent
many
days
hunting
nazis
the
thing
is
ciphers
are
hard
to
keep
secret
there
a
lot
of
math
that
goes
into
one
and
if
they
widely
used
then
everyone
who
uses
them
has
to
keep
them
a
secret
too
and
if
someone
changes
sides
you
have
to
find
a
new
cipher
the
nazi
cipher
was
called
enigma
and
they
used
a
little
mechanical
computer
called
an
enigma
machine
to
scramble
and
unscramble
the
messages
they
got
every
sub
and
boat
and
station
needed
one
of
these
so
it
was
inevitable
that
eventually
the
allies
would
get
their
hands
on
one
when
they
did
they
cracked
it
that
work
was
led
by
my
personal
hero
a
guy
named
alan
turing
who
pretty
much
invented
computers
as
we
know
them
today
unfortunately
for
him
he
was
gay
so
after
the
war
ended
the
stupid
british
government
forced
him
to
get
shot
up
with
hormones
to
cure
his
homosexuality
and
he
killed
himself
darryl
gave
me
a
biography
of
turing
for
my
birthday
wrapped
in
twenty
layers
of
paper
and
in
a
recycled
batmobile
toy
he
was
like
that
with
presents
and
i
been
a
turing
junkie
ever
since
now
the
allies
had
the
enigma
machine
and
they
could
intercept
lots
of
nazi
which
should
have
been
that
big
a
deal
since
every
captain
had
his
own
secret
key
since
the
allies
did
have
the
keys
having
the
machine
should
have
helped
here
where
secrecy
hurts
crypto
the
enigma
cipher
was
flawed
once
turing
looked
hard
at
it
he
figured
out
that
the
nazi
cryptographers
had
made
a
mathematical
mistake
by
getting
his
hands
on
an
enigma
machine
turing
could
figure
out
how
to
crack
nazi
message
no
matter
what
key
it
used
that
cost
the
nazis
the
war
i
mean
do
get
me
wrong
that
good
news
take
it
from
a
castle
wolfenstein
veteran
you
would
want
the
nazis
running
the
country
after
the
war
cryptographers
spent
a
lot
of
time
thinking
about
this
the
problem
had
been
that
turing
was
smarter
than
the
guy
who
thought
up
enigma
any
time
you
had
a
cipher
you
were
vulnerable
to
someone
smarter
than
you
coming
up
with
a
way
of
breaking
it
and
the
more
they
thought
about
it
the
more
they
realized
that
can
come
up
with
a
security
system
that
he
ca
figure
out
how
to
break
but
can
figure
out
what
a
smarter
person
might
do
you
have
to
publish
a
cipher
to
know
that
it
works
you
have
to
tell
many
people
as
how
it
works
so
that
they
can
thwack
on
it
with
everything
they
have
testing
its
security
the
longer
you
go
without
anyone
finding
a
flaw
the
more
secure
you
are
which
is
how
it
stands
today
if
you
want
to
be
safe
you
do
use
crypto
that
some
genius
thought
of
last
week
you
use
the
stuff
that
people
have
been
using
for
as
long
as
possible
without
anyone
figuring
out
how
to
break
them
whether
you
a
bank
a
terrorist
a
government
or
a
teenager
you
use
the
same
ciphers
if
you
tried
to
use
your
own
cipher
there
be
the
chance
that
someone
out
there
had
found
a
flaw
you
missed
and
was
doing
a
turing
on
your
butt
deciphering
all
your
secret
messages
and
chuckling
at
your
dumb
gossip
financial
transactions
and
military
secrets
so
i
knew
that
crypto
would
keep
me
safe
from
eavesdroppers
but
i
was
ready
to
deal
with
histograms
i
got
off
the
bart
and
waved
my
card
over
the
turnstile
as
i
headed
up
to
the
street
station
as
usual
there
were
lots
of
weirdos
hanging
out
in
the
station
drunks
and
jesus
freaks
and
intense
mexican
men
staring
at
the
ground
and
a
few
gang
kids
i
looked
straight
past
them
as
i
hit
the
stairs
and
jogged
up
to
the
surface
my
bag
was
empty
now
no
longer
bulging
with
the
paranoidxbox
discs
i
been
distributing
and
it
made
my
shoulders
feel
light
and
put
a
spring
in
my
step
as
i
came
up
the
street
the
preachers
were
at
work
still
exhorting
in
spanish
and
english
about
jesus
and
so
on
the
counterfeit
sunglass
sellers
were
gone
but
they
been
replaced
by
guys
selling
robot
dogs
that
barked
the
national
anthem
and
would
lift
their
legs
if
you
showed
them
a
picture
of
osama
bin
laden
there
was
probably
some
cool
stuff
going
on
in
their
little
brains
and
i
made
a
mental
note
to
pick
a
couple
of
them
up
and
take
them
apart
later
was
pretty
new
in
toys
having
only
recently
made
the
leap
from
the
military
to
casinos
trying
to
find
cheats
to
law
enforcement
i
started
down
street
toward
potrero
hill
and
home
rolling
my
shoulders
and
smelling
the
burrito
smells
wafting
out
of
the
restaurants
and
thinking
about
dinner
i
do
know
why
i
happened
to
glance
back
over
my
shoulder
but
i
did
maybe
it
was
a
little
bit
of
subconscious
stuff
i
knew
i
was
being
followed
they
were
two
beefy
white
guys
with
little
mustaches
that
made
me
think
of
either
cops
or
the
gay
bikers
who
rode
up
and
down
the
castro
but
gay
guys
usually
had
better
haircuts
they
had
on
windbreakers
the
color
of
old
cement
and
with
their
waistbands
concealed
i
thought
of
all
the
things
a
cop
might
wear
on
his
waistband
of
the
that
dhs
guy
in
the
truck
had
worn
both
guys
were
wearing
bluetooth
headsets
i
kept
walking
my
heart
thumping
in
my
chest
i
been
expecting
this
since
i
started
i
been
expecting
the
dhs
to
figure
out
what
i
was
doing
i
took
every
precaution
but
woman
had
told
me
that
she
be
watching
me
she
told
me
i
was
a
marked
man
i
realized
that
i
been
waiting
to
get
picked
up
and
taken
back
to
jail
why
not
why
should
darryl
be
in
jail
and
not
me
what
did
i
have
going
for
me
i
had
even
had
the
guts
to
tell
my
parents
or
his
what
had
really
happened
to
us
i
quickened
my
steps
and
took
a
mental
inventory
i
did
have
anything
incriminating
in
my
bag
not
too
incriminating
anyway
my
schoolbook
was
running
the
crack
that
let
me
im
and
stuff
but
half
the
people
in
school
had
that
i
changed
the
way
i
encrypted
the
stuff
on
my
phone
now
i
have
a
fake
partition
that
i
could
turn
back
into
cleartext
with
one
password
but
all
the
good
stuff
was
hidden
and
needed
another
password
to
open
up
that
hidden
section
looked
just
like
random
junk
when
you
encrypt
data
it
becomes
indistinguishable
from
random
noise
and
they
never
even
know
it
was
there
there
were
no
discs
in
my
bag
my
laptop
was
free
of
incriminating
evidence
of
course
if
they
thought
to
look
hard
at
my
xbox
it
was
game
over
so
to
speak
i
stopped
where
i
was
standing
i
done
as
good
a
job
as
i
could
of
covering
myself
it
was
time
to
face
my
fate
i
stepped
into
the
nearest
burrito
joint
and
ordered
one
with
carnitas
shredded
pork
and
extra
salsa
might
as
well
go
down
with
a
full
stomach
i
got
a
bucket
of
horchata
too
an
rice
drink
that
like
watery
better
than
it
sounds
i
sat
down
to
eat
and
a
profound
calm
fell
over
me
i
was
about
to
go
to
jail
for
my
crimes
or
i
was
my
freedom
since
they
taken
me
in
had
been
just
a
temporary
holiday
my
country
was
not
my
friend
anymore
we
were
now
on
different
sides
and
i
known
i
could
never
win
the
two
guys
came
into
the
restaurant
as
i
was
finishing
the
burrito
and
going
up
to
order
some
churros
dough
with
cinnamon
sugar
for
dessert
i
guess
they
been
waiting
outside
and
got
tired
of
my
dawdling
they
stood
behind
me
at
the
counter
boxing
me
in
i
took
my
churro
from
the
pretty
granny
and
paid
her
taking
a
couple
of
quick
bites
of
the
dough
before
i
turned
around
i
wanted
to
eat
at
least
a
little
of
my
dessert
it
might
be
the
last
dessert
i
got
for
a
long
long
time
then
i
turned
around
they
were
both
so
close
i
could
see
the
zit
on
the
cheek
of
the
one
on
the
left
the
little
booger
up
the
nose
of
the
other
me
i
said
trying
to
push
past
them
the
one
with
the
booger
moved
to
block
me
sir
he
said
can
you
step
over
here
with
us
he
gestured
toward
the
restaurant
door
sorry
i
eating
i
said
and
moved
again
this
time
he
put
his
hand
on
my
chest
he
was
breathing
fast
through
his
nose
making
the
booger
wiggle
i
think
i
was
breathing
hard
too
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
over
the
hammering
of
my
heart
the
other
one
flipped
down
a
flap
on
the
front
of
his
windbreaker
to
reveal
a
sfpd
insignia
police
he
said
please
come
with
us
let
me
just
get
my
stuff
i
said
we
take
care
of
that
he
said
the
booger
one
stepped
right
up
close
to
me
his
foot
on
the
inside
of
mine
you
do
that
in
some
martial
arts
too
it
lets
you
feel
if
the
other
guy
is
shifting
his
weight
getting
ready
to
move
i
was
going
to
run
though
i
knew
i
could
outrun
fate
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
new
york
city
books
of
wonder
the
oldest
and
largest
kids
bookstore
in
manhattan
they
located
just
a
few
blocks
away
from
tor
books
offices
in
the
flatiron
building
and
every
time
i
drop
in
to
meet
with
the
tor
people
i
always
sneak
away
to
books
of
wonder
to
peruse
their
stock
of
new
used
and
rare
kids
books
i
a
heavy
collector
of
rare
editions
of
alice
in
wonderland
and
books
of
wonder
never
fails
to
excite
me
with
some
beautiful
alice
they
have
tons
of
events
for
kids
and
one
of
the
most
inviting
atmospheres
i
ever
experienced
at
a
bookstore
books
of
wonder
http
west
st
new
york
ny
usa
they
took
me
outside
and
around
the
corner
to
a
waiting
unmarked
police
car
it
was
like
anyone
in
that
neighborhood
would
have
had
a
hard
time
figuring
out
that
it
was
a
though
only
police
drive
big
crown
victorias
now
that
gas
had
hit
seven
bucks
a
gallon
what
more
only
cops
could
in
the
middle
of
van
ness
street
without
getting
towed
by
the
schools
of
predatory
that
circled
endlessly
ready
to
enforce
san
francisco
incomprehensible
parking
regulations
and
collect
a
bounty
for
kidnapping
your
car
booger
blew
his
nose
i
was
sitting
in
the
back
seat
and
so
was
he
his
partner
was
sitting
in
the
front
typing
with
one
finger
on
an
ancient
ruggedized
laptop
that
looked
like
fred
flintstone
had
been
its
original
owner
booger
looked
closely
at
my
id
again
we
just
want
to
ask
you
a
few
routine
questions
can
i
see
your
badges
i
said
these
guys
were
clearly
cops
but
it
could
hurt
to
let
them
know
i
knew
my
rights
booger
flashed
his
badge
at
me
too
fast
for
me
to
get
a
good
look
at
it
but
zit
in
the
front
seat
gave
me
a
long
look
at
his
i
got
their
division
number
and
memorized
the
badge
number
it
was
easy
is
also
the
way
hackers
write
leet
or
elite
they
were
both
being
very
polite
and
neither
of
them
was
trying
to
intimidate
me
the
way
that
the
dhs
had
done
when
i
was
in
their
custody
am
i
under
arrest
you
been
momentarily
detained
so
that
we
can
ensure
your
safety
and
the
general
public
safety
booger
said
he
passed
my
driver
license
up
to
zit
who
pecked
it
slowly
into
his
computer
i
saw
him
make
a
typo
and
almost
corrected
him
but
figured
it
was
better
to
just
keep
my
mouth
shut
is
there
anything
you
want
to
tell
me
marcus
do
they
call
you
marc
marcus
is
fine
i
said
booger
looked
like
he
might
be
a
nice
guy
except
for
the
part
about
kidnapping
me
into
his
car
of
course
marcus
anything
you
want
to
tell
me
like
what
am
i
under
arrest
you
not
under
arrest
right
now
booger
said
would
you
like
to
be
no
i
said
good
we
been
watching
you
since
you
left
the
bart
your
fast
pass
says
that
you
been
riding
to
a
lot
of
strange
places
at
a
lot
of
funny
hours
i
felt
something
let
go
inside
my
chest
this
was
about
the
xnet
at
all
then
not
really
they
been
watching
my
subway
use
and
wanted
to
know
why
it
had
been
so
freaky
lately
how
totally
stupid
so
you
guys
follow
everyone
who
comes
out
of
the
bart
station
with
a
funny
you
must
be
busy
not
everyone
marcus
we
get
an
alert
when
anyone
with
an
uncommon
ride
profile
comes
out
and
that
helps
us
assess
whether
we
want
to
investigate
in
your
case
we
came
along
because
we
wanted
to
know
why
a
kid
like
you
had
such
a
funny
ride
profile
now
that
i
knew
i
was
about
to
go
to
jail
i
was
getting
pissed
these
guys
had
no
business
spying
on
me
christ
the
bart
had
no
business
them
to
spy
on
me
where
the
hell
did
my
subway
pass
get
off
on
finking
me
out
for
having
a
nonstandard
ride
pattern
i
think
i
like
to
be
arrested
now
i
said
booger
sat
back
and
raised
his
eyebrow
at
me
really
on
what
charge
oh
you
mean
riding
public
transit
in
a
nonstandard
way
is
a
crime
zit
closed
his
eyes
and
scrubbed
them
with
his
thumbs
booger
sighed
a
sigh
look
marcus
we
on
your
side
here
we
use
this
system
to
catch
bad
guys
to
catch
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
maybe
you
a
drug
dealer
yourself
pretty
good
way
to
get
around
the
city
a
fast
pass
anonymous
what
wrong
with
anonymous
it
was
good
enough
for
thomas
jefferson
and
by
the
way
am
i
under
arrest
let
take
him
home
zit
said
we
can
talk
to
his
parents
i
think
that
a
great
idea
i
said
i
sure
my
parents
will
be
anxious
to
hear
how
their
tax
dollars
are
being
spent
i
pushed
it
too
far
booger
had
been
reaching
for
the
door
handle
but
now
he
whirled
on
me
all
hulked
out
and
throbbing
veins
why
do
you
shut
up
right
now
while
it
still
an
option
after
everything
that
happened
in
the
past
two
weeks
it
would
kill
you
to
cooperate
with
us
you
know
what
maybe
we
arrest
you
you
can
spend
a
day
or
two
in
jail
while
your
lawyer
looks
for
you
a
lot
can
happen
in
that
time
a
how
you
like
that
i
did
say
anything
i
been
giddy
and
angry
now
i
was
scared
witless
i
sorry
i
managed
hating
myself
again
for
saying
it
booger
got
in
the
front
seat
and
zit
put
the
car
in
gear
cruising
up
street
and
over
potrero
hill
they
had
my
address
from
my
id
mom
answered
the
door
after
they
rang
the
bell
leaving
the
chain
on
she
peeked
around
it
saw
me
and
said
marcus
who
are
these
men
police
booger
said
he
showed
her
his
badge
letting
her
get
a
good
look
at
it
not
whipping
it
away
the
way
he
had
with
me
can
we
come
in
mom
closed
the
door
and
took
the
chain
off
and
let
them
in
they
brought
me
in
and
mom
gave
the
three
of
us
one
of
her
looks
what
this
about
booger
pointed
at
me
we
wanted
to
ask
your
son
some
routine
questions
about
his
movements
but
he
declined
to
answer
them
we
felt
it
might
be
best
to
bring
him
here
is
he
under
arrest
mom
accent
was
coming
on
strong
good
old
mom

stripped
paint
i
shore

hyuck
she
said
in
a
broad
southern
accent
am
under
arrest
the
two
cops
exchanged
a
look
zit
took
the
fore
we
seem
to
have
gotten
off
to
a
bad
start
we
identified
your
son
as
someone
with
a
nonstandard
public
transit
usage
pattern
as
part
of
a
new
enforcement
program
when
we
spot
people
whose
travels
are
unusual
or
that
match
a
suspicious
profile

investigate

cup
of
tea
in
that
was
practically
like
making
them
shout
through
the
but
once
she
folded
her
arms
it
was
not
going
to
end
well
for
them
at
that
moment
i
wanted
to
go
and
buy
her
a
big
bunch
of
flowers
marcus
here
declined
to
tell
us
why
his
movements
had
been
what
they
were
are
you
saying
you
think
my
son
is
a
terrorist
because
of
how
he
rides
the
bus
terrorists
are
the
only
bad
guys
we
catch
this
way
zit
said
drug
dealers
gang
kids
even
shoplifters
smart
enough
to
hit
a
different
neighborhood
with
every
run
you
think
my
son
is
a
drug
dealer
we
not
saying
that
zit
began
mom
clapped
her
hands
at
him
to
shut
him
up
marcus
please
pass
me
your
backpack
i
did
mom
unzipped
it
and
looked
through
it
turning
her
back
to
us
first
officers
i
can
now
affirm
that
there
are
no
narcotics
explosives
or
shoplifted
gewgaws
in
my
son
bag
i
think
we
done
here
i
would
like
your
badge
numbers
before
you
go
please
booger
sneered
at
her
lady
the
aclu
is
suing
three
hundred
cops
on
the
sfpd
you
going
to
have
to
get
in
line
mom
made
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
then
chewed
me
out
for
eating
dinner
when
i
knew
that
she
been
making
falafel
dad
came
home
while
we
were
still
at
the
table
and
mom
and
i
took
turns
telling
him
the
story
he
shook
his
head
lillian
they
were
just
doing
their
jobs
he
was
still
wearing
the
blue
blazer
and
khakis
he
wore
on
the
days
that
he
was
consulting
in
silicon
valley
the
world
is
the
same
place
it
was
last
week
mom
set
down
her
teacup
drew
you
being
ridiculous
your
son
is
not
a
terrorist
his
use
of
the
public
transit
system
is
not
cause
for
a
police
investigation
dad
took
off
his
blazer
we
do
this
all
the
time
at
my
work
it
how
computers
can
be
used
to
find
all
kinds
of
errors
anomalies
and
outcomes
you
ask
the
computer
to
create
a
profile
of
an
average
record
in
a
database
and
then
ask
it
to
find
out
which
records
in
the
database
are
furthest
away
from
average
it
part
of
something
called
bayesian
analysis
and
it
been
around
for
centuries
now
without
it
we
could
do
so
you
saying
that
you
think
the
police
should
suck
as
hard
as
my
spam
filter
i
said
dad
never
got
angry
at
me
for
arguing
with
him
but
tonight
i
could
see
the
strain
was
running
high
in
him
still
i
could
resist
my
own
father
taking
the
police
side
i
saying
that
it
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
police
to
conduct
their
investigations
by
starting
with
and
then
following
it
up
with
where
a
human
being
actually
intervenes
to
see
why
the
abnormality
exists
i
do
think
that
a
computer
should
be
telling
the
police
whom
to
arrest
just
helping
them
sort
through
the
haystack
to
find
a
needle
but
by
taking
in
all
that
data
from
the
transit
system
they
the
i
said
that
a
gigantic
mountain
of
data
and
there
almost
nothing
worth
looking
at
there
from
the
police
point
of
view
it
a
total
waste
i
understand
that
you
do
like
that
this
system
caused
you
some
inconvenience
marcus
but
you
of
all
people
should
appreciate
the
gravity
of
the
situation
there
was
no
harm
done
was
there
they
even
gave
you
a
ride
home
threatened
to
send
me
to
jail
i
thought
but
i
could
see
there
was
no
point
in
saying
it
besides
you
still
have
told
us
where
the
blazing
hells
you
been
to
create
such
an
unusual
traffic
pattern
that
brought
me
up
short
i
thought
you
relied
on
my
judgment
that
you
did
want
to
spy
on
me
he
said
this
often
enough
do
you
really
want
me
to
account
for
every
trip
i
ever
taken
i
hooked
up
my
xbox
as
soon
as
i
got
to
my
room
i
bolted
the
projector
to
the
ceiling
so
that
it
could
shine
on
the
wall
over
my
bed
i
had
to
take
down
my
awesome
mural
of
punk
rock
handbills
i
taken
down
off
telephone
poles
and
glued
to
big
sheets
of
white
paper
i
powered
up
the
xbox
and
watched
as
it
came
onto
the
screen
i
was
going
to
email
van
and
jolu
to
tell
them
about
the
hassles
with
the
cops
but
as
i
put
my
fingers
to
the
keyboard
i
stopped
again
a
feeling
crept
over
me
one
not
unlike
the
feeling
i
had
when
i
realized
that
they
turned
poor
old
salmagundi
into
a
traitor
this
time
it
was
the
feeling
that
my
beloved
xnet
might
be
broadcasting
the
location
of
every
one
of
its
users
to
the
dhs
it
was
what
dad
had
said
ask
the
computer
to
create
a
profile
of
an
average
record
in
a
database
and
then
ask
it
to
find
out
which
records
in
the
database
are
furthest
away
from
average
the
xnet
was
secure
because
its
users
were
directly
connected
to
the
internet
they
hopped
from
xbox
to
xbox
until
they
found
one
that
was
connected
to
the
internet
then
they
injected
their
material
as
undecipherable
encrypted
data
no
one
could
tell
which
of
the
internet
packets
were
xnet
and
which
ones
were
just
plain
old
banking
and
and
other
encrypted
communication
you
could
find
out
who
was
tying
the
xnet
let
alone
who
was
using
the
xnet
but
what
about
dad
bayesian
statistics
i
played
with
bayesian
math
before
darryl
and
i
once
tried
to
write
our
own
better
spam
filter
and
when
you
filter
spam
you
need
bayesian
math
thomas
bayes
was
an
century
british
mathematician
that
no
one
cared
about
until
a
couple
hundred
years
after
he
died
when
computer
scientists
realized
that
his
technique
for
statistically
analyzing
mountains
of
data
would
be
for
the
modern
world
here
some
of
how
bayesian
stats
work
say
you
got
a
bunch
of
spam
you
take
every
word
that
in
the
spam
and
count
how
many
times
it
appears
this
is
called
a
word
frequency
histogram
and
it
tells
you
what
the
probability
is
that
any
bag
of
words
is
likely
to
be
spam
now
take
a
ton
of
email
that
not
spam
in
the
biz
they
call
that
ham
and
do
the
same
wait
until
a
new
email
arrives
and
count
the
words
that
appear
in
it
then
use
the
histogram
in
the
candidate
message
to
calculate
the
probability
that
it
belongs
in
the
spam
pile
or
the
ham
pile
if
it
turns
out
to
be
spam
you
adjust
the
spam
histogram
accordingly
there
are
lots
of
ways
to
refine
the
technique
looking
at
words
in
pairs
throwing
away
old
data
but
this
is
how
it
works
at
core
it
one
of
those
great
simple
ideas
that
seems
obvious
after
you
hear
about
it
it
got
lots
of
applications
you
can
ask
a
computer
to
count
the
lines
in
a
picture
and
see
if
it
more
like
a
dog
histogram
or
a
cat
histogram
it
can
find
porn
bank
fraud
and
flamewars
useful
stuff
and
it
was
bad
news
for
the
xnet
say
you
had
the
whole
internet
wiretapped
which
of
course
the
dhs
has
you
ca
tell
who
passing
xnet
packets
by
looking
at
the
contents
of
those
packets
thanks
to
crypto
what
you
do
is
find
out
who
is
sending
way
way
more
encrypted
traffic
out
than
everyone
else
for
a
normal
internet
surfer
a
session
online
is
probably
about
percent
cleartext
five
percent
ciphertext
if
someone
is
sending
out
percent
ciphertext
maybe
you
could
dispatch
the
equivalents
of
booger
and
zit
to
ask
them
if
they
terrorist
xnet
users
this
happens
all
the
time
in
china
some
smart
dissident
will
get
the
idea
of
getting
around
the
great
firewall
of
china
which
is
used
to
censor
the
whole
country
internet
connection
by
using
an
encrypted
connection
to
a
computer
in
some
other
country
now
the
party
there
ca
tell
what
the
dissident
is
surfing
maybe
it
porn
or
instructions
or
dirty
letters
from
his
girlfriend
in
the
philippines
or
political
material
or
good
news
about
scientology
they
do
have
to
know
all
they
have
to
know
is
that
this
guy
gets
way
more
encrypted
traffic
than
his
neighbors
at
that
point
they
send
him
to
a
forced
labor
camp
just
to
set
an
example
so
that
everyone
can
see
what
happens
to
so
far
i
was
willing
to
bet
that
the
xnet
was
under
the
dhs
radar
but
it
would
be
the
case
forever
and
after
tonight
i
was
sure
that
i
was
in
any
better
shape
than
a
chinese
dissident
i
was
putting
all
the
people
who
signed
onto
the
xnet
in
jeopardy
the
law
did
care
if
you
were
actually
doing
anything
bad
they
were
willing
to
put
you
under
the
microscope
just
for
being
statistically
abnormal
and
i
could
even
stop
it
now
that
the
xnet
was
running
it
had
a
life
of
its
own
i
was
going
to
have
to
fix
it
some
other
way
i
wished
i
could
talk
to
jolu
about
this
he
worked
at
an
internet
service
provider
called
pigspleen
net
that
had
hired
him
when
he
was
twelve
and
he
knew
way
more
about
the
net
than
i
did
if
anyone
knew
how
to
keep
our
butts
out
of
jail
it
would
be
him
luckily
van
and
jolu
and
i
were
planning
to
meet
for
coffee
the
next
night
at
our
favorite
place
in
the
mission
after
school
officially
it
was
our
weekly
harajuku
fun
madness
team
meeting
but
with
the
game
canceled
and
darryl
gone
it
was
pretty
much
just
a
weekly
supplemented
by
about
six
and
ims
a
day
that
went
are
you
ok
did
it
really
happen
it
would
be
good
to
have
something
else
to
talk
about
you
out
of
your
mind
vanessa
said
are
you
actually
totally
really
crazy
or
what
she
had
shown
up
in
her
girl
school
uniform
because
she
been
stuck
going
the
long
way
home
all
the
way
down
to
the
san
mateo
bridge
then
back
up
into
the
city
on
a
service
that
her
school
was
operating
she
hated
being
seen
in
public
in
her
gear
which
was
totally
sailor
moon
a
pleated
skirt
and
a
tunic
and
she
been
in
a
bad
mood
ever
since
she
turned
up
at
the
cafe
which
was
full
of
older
cooler
mopey
emo
art
students
who
snickered
into
their
lattes
when
she
turned
up
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
van
i
said
i
was
getting
exasperated
myself
school
was
unbearable
now
that
the
game
was
on
now
that
darryl
was
missing
all
day
long
in
my
classes
i
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
of
seeing
my
team
what
was
left
of
it
now
we
were
fighting
i
want
you
to
stop
putting
yourself
at
risk
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
my
neck
stood
up
sure
we
always
used
our
team
handles
at
team
meetings
but
now
that
my
handle
was
also
associated
with
my
xnet
use
it
scared
me
to
hear
it
said
aloud
in
a
public
place
do
use
that
name
in
public
anymore
i
snapped
van
shook
her
head
that
just
what
i
talking
about
you
could
end
up
going
to
jail
for
this
marcus
and
not
just
you
lots
of
people
after
what
happened
to
darryl
i
doing
this
for
darryl
art
students
swiveled
to
look
at
us
and
i
lowered
my
voice
i
doing
this
because
the
alternative
is
to
let
them
get
away
with
it
all
you
think
you
going
to
stop
them
you
out
of
your
mind
they
the
government
it
still
our
country
i
said
we
still
have
the
right
to
do
this
van
looked
like
she
was
going
to
cry
she
took
a
couple
of
deep
breaths
and
stood
up
i
ca
do
it
i
sorry
i
ca
watch
you
do
this
it
like
watching
a
in
slow
motion
you
going
to
destroy
yourself
and
i
love
you
too
much
to
watch
it
happen
she
bent
down
and
gave
me
a
fierce
hug
and
a
hard
kiss
on
the
cheek
that
caught
the
edge
of
my
mouth
take
care
of
yourself
marcus
she
said
my
mouth
burned
where
her
lips
had
pressed
it
she
gave
jolu
the
same
treatment
but
square
on
the
cheek
then
she
left
jolu
and
i
stared
at
each
other
after
she
gone
i
put
my
face
in
my
hands
dammit
i
said
finally
jolu
patted
me
on
the
back
and
ordered
me
another
latte
it
be
ok
he
said
you
think
van
of
all
people
would
understand
half
of
van
family
lived
in
north
korea
her
parents
never
forgot
that
they
had
all
those
people
living
under
a
crazy
dictator
not
able
to
escape
to
america
the
way
her
parents
had
jolu
shrugged
maybe
that
why
she
so
freaked
out
because
she
knows
how
dangerous
it
can
get
i
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
two
of
van
uncles
had
gone
to
jail
and
had
never
reappeared
yeah
i
said
so
how
come
you
were
on
xnet
last
night
i
was
grateful
for
the
distraction
i
explained
it
all
to
him
the
bayesian
stuff
and
my
fear
that
we
could
go
on
using
xnet
the
way
we
had
been
without
getting
nabbed
he
listened
thoughtfully
i
see
what
you
saying
the
problem
is
that
if
there
too
much
crypto
in
someone
internet
connection
they
stand
out
as
unusual
but
if
you
do
encrypt
you
make
it
easy
for
the
bad
guys
to
wiretap
you
yeah
i
said
i
been
trying
to
figure
it
out
all
day
maybe
we
could
slow
the
connection
down
spread
it
out
over
more
peoples
accounts
wo
work
he
said
to
get
it
slow
enough
to
vanish
into
the
noise
you
have
to
basically
shut
down
the
network
which
is
an
option
you
right
i
said
but
what
else
can
we
do
what
if
we
changed
the
definition
of
normal
and
that
was
why
jolu
got
hired
to
work
at
pigspleen
when
he
was
give
him
a
problem
with
two
bad
solutions
and
he
figure
out
a
third
totally
different
solution
based
on
throwing
away
all
your
assumptions
i
nodded
vigorously
go
on
tell
me
what
if
the
average
san
francisco
internet
user
had
a
more
crypto
in
his
average
day
on
the
internet
if
we
could
change
the
split
so
it
more
like
cleartext
to
ciphertext
then
the
users
that
supply
the
xnet
would
just
look
like
normal
but
how
do
we
do
that
people
just
do
care
enough
about
their
privacy
to
surf
the
net
through
an
encrypted
link
they
do
see
why
it
matters
if
eavesdroppers
know
what
they
googling
for
yeah
but
are
small
amounts
of
traffic
if
we
got
people
to
routinely
download
a
few
giant
encrypted
files
every
day
that
would
create
as
much
ciphertext
as
thousands
of
you
talking
about
indienet
i
said
you
got
it
he
said
indienet
all
lower
case
always
was
the
thing
that
made
pigspleen
net
into
one
of
the
most
successful
independent
isps
in
the
world
back
when
the
major
record
labels
started
suing
their
fans
for
downloading
their
music
a
lot
of
the
independent
labels
and
their
artists
were
aghast
how
can
you
make
money
by
suing
your
customers
pigspleen
founder
had
the
answer
she
opened
up
a
deal
for
any
act
that
wanted
to
work
with
their
fans
instead
of
fighting
them
give
pigspleen
a
license
to
distribute
your
music
to
its
customers
and
it
would
give
you
a
share
of
the
subscription
fees
based
on
how
popular
your
music
was
for
an
indie
artist
the
big
problem
is
piracy
it
obscurity
no
one
even
cares
enough
about
your
tunes
to
steal
it
worked
hundreds
of
independent
acts
and
labels
signed
up
with
pigspleen
and
the
more
music
there
was
the
more
fans
switched
to
getting
their
internet
service
from
pigspleen
and
the
more
money
there
was
for
the
artists
inside
of
a
year
the
isp
had
a
hundred
thousand
new
customers
and
now
it
had
a
million
more
than
half
the
broadband
connections
in
the
city
an
overhaul
of
the
indienet
code
has
been
on
my
plate
for
months
now
jolu
said
the
original
programs
were
written
really
fast
and
dirty
and
they
could
be
made
a
lot
more
efficient
with
a
little
work
but
i
just
have
had
the
time
one
of
the
items
has
been
to
encrypt
the
connections
just
because
trudy
likes
it
that
way
trudy
doo
was
the
founder
of
pigspleen
she
was
an
old
time
san
francisco
punk
legend
the
of
the
band
speedwhores
and
she
was
crazy
about
privacy
i
could
totally
believe
that
she
want
her
music
service
encrypted
on
general
principles
will
it
be
hard
i
mean
how
long
would
it
take
well
there
tons
of
crypto
code
for
free
online
of
course
jolu
said
he
was
doing
the
thing
he
did
when
he
was
digging
into
a
meaty
code
problem
getting
that
faraway
look
drumming
his
palms
on
the
table
making
the
coffee
slosh
into
the
saucers
i
wanted
to
laugh
everything
might
be
destroyed
and
crap
and
scary
but
jolu
would
write
that
code
can
i
help
he
looked
at
me
what
you
do
think
i
can
manage
it
what
i
mean
you
did
this
whole
xnet
thing
without
even
telling
me
without
talking
to
me
i
kind
of
thought
that
you
did
need
my
help
with
this
stuff
i
was
brought
up
short
what
i
said
again
jolu
was
looking
really
steamed
now
it
was
clear
that
this
had
been
eating
him
for
a
long
time
jolu
he
looked
at
me
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
furious
how
had
i
missed
this
god
i
was
such
an
idiot
sometimes
look
dude
it
not
a
big
deal
by
which
he
clearly
meant
that
it
was
a
really
big
deal
it
just
that
you
know
you
never
even
i
hate
the
dhs
darryl
was
my
friend
too
i
could
have
really
helped
with
it
i
wanted
to
stick
my
head
between
my
knees
listen
jolu
that
was
really
stupid
of
me
i
did
it
at
like
two
in
the
morning
i
was
just
crazy
when
it
was
happening
i
i
could
explain
it
yeah
he
was
right
and
that
was
the
problem
it
had
been
two
in
the
morning
but
i
could
have
talked
to
jolu
about
it
the
next
day
or
the
next
i
had
because
i
known
what
he
say
that
it
was
an
ugly
hack
that
i
needed
to
think
it
through
better
jolu
was
always
figuring
out
how
to
turn
my
am
ideas
into
real
code
but
the
stuff
that
he
came
out
with
was
always
a
little
different
from
what
i
come
up
with
i
wanted
the
project
for
myself
i
gotten
totally
into
being
i
sorry
i
said
at
last
i
really
really
sorry
you
totally
right
i
just
got
freaked
out
and
did
something
stupid
i
really
need
your
help
i
ca
make
this
work
without
you
you
mean
it
of
course
i
mean
it
i
said
you
the
best
coder
i
know
you
a
goddamned
genius
jolu
i
would
be
honored
if
you
help
me
with
this
he
drummed
his
fingers
some
more
it
just
you
know
you
the
leader
van
the
smart
one
darryl
was
he
was
your
the
guy
who
had
it
all
organized
who
watched
the
details
being
the
programmer
that
was
thing
it
felt
like
you
were
saying
you
did
need
me
oh
man
i
am
such
an
idiot
jolu
you
the
person
i
know
to
do
this
i
really
really
really
all
right
already
stop
fine
i
believe
you
we
all
really
screwed
up
right
now
so
yeah
of
course
you
can
help
we
can
probably
even
pay
you
i
got
a
little
budget
for
contract
programmers
really
no
one
had
ever
paid
me
for
writing
code
sure
you
probably
good
enough
to
be
worth
it
he
grinned
and
slugged
me
in
the
shoulder
jolu
really
most
of
the
time
which
is
why
he
freaked
me
out
so
much
i
paid
for
the
coffees
and
we
went
out
i
called
my
parents
and
let
them
know
what
i
was
doing
jolu
mom
insisted
on
making
us
sandwiches
we
locked
ourselves
in
his
room
with
his
computer
and
the
code
for
indienet
and
we
embarked
on
one
of
the
great
marathon
programming
sessions
once
jolu
family
went
to
bed
around
we
were
able
to
kidnap
the
up
to
his
room
and
go
iv
with
our
magic
coffee
bean
supply
if
you
never
programmed
a
computer
you
should
there
nothing
like
it
in
the
whole
world
when
you
program
a
computer
it
does
what
you
tell
it
to
do
it
like
designing
a
machine
any
machine
like
a
car
like
a
faucet
like
a
for
a
door
using
math
and
instructions
it
awesome
in
the
truest
sense
it
can
fill
you
with
awe
a
computer
is
the
most
complicated
machine
you
ever
use
it
made
of
billions
of
transistors
that
can
be
configured
to
run
any
program
you
can
imagine
but
when
you
sit
down
at
the
keyboard
and
write
a
line
of
code
those
transistors
do
what
you
tell
them
to
most
of
us
will
never
build
a
car
pretty
much
none
of
us
will
ever
create
an
aviation
system
design
a
building
lay
out
a
city
those
are
complicated
machines
those
things
and
they
to
the
likes
of
you
and
me
but
a
computer
is
like
ten
times
more
complicated
and
it
will
dance
to
any
tune
you
play
you
can
learn
to
write
simple
code
in
an
afternoon
start
with
a
language
like
python
which
was
written
to
give
an
easier
way
to
make
the
machine
dance
to
their
tune
even
if
you
only
write
code
for
one
day
one
afternoon
you
have
to
do
it
computers
can
control
you
or
they
can
lighten
your
work
if
you
want
to
be
in
charge
of
your
machines
you
have
to
learn
to
write
code
we
wrote
a
lot
of
code
that
night
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
borders
the
global
bookselling
giant
that
you
can
find
in
cities
all
over
the
world
i
never
forget
walking
into
the
gigantic
borders
on
orchard
road
in
singapore
and
discovering
a
shelf
loaded
with
my
novels
for
many
years
the
borders
in
oxford
street
in
london
hosted
pat
cadigan
monthly
science
fiction
evenings
where
local
and
visiting
authors
would
read
their
work
speak
about
science
fiction
and
meet
their
fans
when
i
in
a
strange
city
which
happens
a
lot
and
i
need
a
great
book
for
my
next
flight
there
always
seems
to
be
a
borders
brimming
with
great
choices
i
especially
partial
to
the
borders
on
union
square
in
san
francisco
borders
worldwide
http
i
was
the
only
one
who
got
screwed
up
by
the
histograms
there
are
lots
of
people
who
have
abnormal
traffic
patterns
abnormal
usage
patterns
abnormal
is
so
common
it
practically
normal
the
xnet
was
full
of
these
stories
and
so
were
the
newspapers
and
the
tv
news
husbands
were
caught
cheating
on
their
wives
wives
were
caught
cheating
on
their
husbands
kids
were
caught
sneaking
out
with
illicit
girlfriends
and
boyfriends
a
kid
who
had
told
his
parents
he
had
aids
got
caught
going
to
the
clinic
for
his
drugs
those
were
the
people
with
something
to
hide
not
guilty
people
but
people
with
secrets
there
were
even
more
people
with
nothing
to
hide
at
all
but
who
nevertheless
resented
being
picked
up
and
questioned
imagine
if
someone
locked
you
in
the
back
of
a
police
car
and
demanded
that
you
prove
that
you
a
terrorist
it
was
just
public
transit
most
drivers
in
the
bay
area
have
a
fastrak
pass
clipped
to
their
this
is
a
little
wallet
that
pays
your
tolls
for
you
when
you
cross
the
bridges
saving
you
the
hassle
of
sitting
in
a
line
for
hours
at
the
they
tripled
the
cost
of
using
cash
to
get
across
the
bridge
though
they
always
fudged
this
saying
that
fastrak
was
cheaper
not
that
anonymous
cash
was
more
expensive
whatever
holdouts
were
left
afterward
disappeared
after
the
number
of
was
reduced
to
just
one
per
so
that
the
cash
lines
were
even
longer
so
if
you
a
local
or
if
you
driving
a
rental
car
from
a
local
agency
you
got
a
fastrak
it
turns
out
that
are
the
only
place
that
your
fastrak
gets
read
though
the
dhs
had
put
fastrak
readers
all
over
town
when
you
drove
past
them
they
logged
the
time
and
your
id
number
building
an
perfect
picture
of
who
went
where
when
in
a
database
that
was
augmented
by
speeding
cameras
red
light
cameras
and
all
the
other
cameras
that
had
popped
up
like
mushrooms
no
one
had
given
it
much
thought
and
now
that
people
were
paying
attention
we
were
all
starting
to
notice
little
things
like
the
fact
that
the
fastrak
does
have
an
so
if
you
drove
a
car
you
were
just
as
likely
to
be
pulled
over
by
an
sfpd
cruiser
that
wanted
to
know
why
you
were
taking
so
many
trips
to
the
home
depot
lately
and
what
was
that
midnight
drive
up
to
sonoma
last
week
about
the
little
demonstrations
around
town
on
the
weekend
were
growing
fifty
thousand
people
marched
down
market
street
after
a
week
of
this
monitoring
i
could
care
less
the
people
who
occupied
my
city
did
care
what
the
natives
wanted
they
were
a
conquering
army
they
knew
how
we
felt
about
that
one
morning
i
came
down
to
breakfast
just
in
time
to
hear
dad
tell
mom
that
the
two
biggest
taxi
companies
were
going
to
give
a
discount
to
people
who
used
special
cards
to
pay
their
fares
supposedly
to
make
drivers
safer
by
reducing
the
amount
of
cash
they
carried
i
wondered
what
would
happen
to
the
information
about
who
took
which
cabs
where
i
realized
how
close
i
come
the
new
indienet
client
had
been
pushed
out
as
an
automatic
update
just
as
this
stuff
started
to
get
bad
and
jolu
told
me
that
percent
of
the
traffic
he
saw
at
pigspleen
was
now
encrypted
the
xnet
just
might
have
been
saved
dad
was
driving
me
nuts
though
you
being
paranoid
marcus
he
told
me
over
breakfast
one
day
as
i
told
him
about
the
guys
i
seen
the
cops
shaking
down
on
bart
the
day
before
dad
it
ridiculous
they
not
catching
any
terrorists
are
they
it
just
making
people
scared
they
may
not
have
caught
any
terrorists
yet
but
they
sure
getting
a
lot
of
scumbags
off
the
streets
look
at
the
drug
dealers
it
says
they
put
dozens
of
them
away
since
this
all
started
remember
when
those
druggies
robbed
you
if
we
do
bust
their
dealers
it
only
get
worse
i
been
mugged
the
year
before
they
been
pretty
civilized
about
it
one
skinny
guy
who
smelled
bad
told
me
he
had
a
gun
the
other
one
asked
me
for
my
wallet
they
even
let
me
keep
my
id
though
they
got
my
debit
card
and
fast
pass
it
had
still
scared
me
witless
and
left
me
paranoid
and
checking
my
shoulder
for
weeks
but
most
of
the
people
they
hold
up
are
doing
anything
wrong
dad
i
said
this
was
getting
to
me
my
own
father
it
crazy
for
every
guilty
person
they
catch
they
have
to
punish
thousands
of
innocent
people
that
just
not
good
innocent
guys
cheating
on
their
wives
drug
dealers
you
defending
them
but
what
about
all
the
people
who
died
if
you
do
have
anything
to
hide
so
you
would
mind
if
they
pulled
over
my
dad
histograms
had
proven
to
be
depressingly
normal
so
far
i
consider
it
my
duty
he
said
i
be
proud
it
would
make
me
feel
safer
easy
for
him
to
say
vanessa
did
like
me
talking
about
this
stuff
but
she
was
too
smart
about
it
for
me
to
stay
away
from
the
subject
for
long
we
get
together
all
the
time
and
talk
about
the
weather
and
school
and
stuff
and
then
somehow
i
be
back
on
this
subject
vanessa
was
cool
when
it
happened
she
did
hulk
out
on
me
again
but
i
could
see
it
upset
her
still
so
my
dad
says
consider
it
my
duty
can
you
freaking
it
i
mean
god
i
almost
told
him
then
about
going
to
jail
asking
him
if
he
thought
that
was
our
we
were
sitting
in
the
grass
in
dolores
park
after
school
watching
the
dogs
chase
frisbees
van
had
stopped
at
home
and
changed
into
an
old
for
one
of
her
favorite
brazilian
bands
carioca
the
forbidden
guy
from
rio
she
gotten
the
shirt
at
a
live
show
we
all
gone
to
two
years
before
sneaking
out
for
a
grand
adventure
down
at
the
cow
palace
and
she
sprouted
an
inch
or
two
since
so
it
was
tight
and
rode
up
her
tummy
showing
her
flat
little
belly
button
she
lay
back
in
the
weak
sun
with
her
eyes
closed
behind
her
shades
her
toes
wiggling
in
her
i
known
van
since
forever
and
when
i
thought
of
her
i
usually
saw
the
little
kid
i
known
with
hundreds
of
jangly
bracelets
made
out
of
soda
cans
who
played
the
piano
and
could
dance
to
save
her
life
sitting
out
there
in
dolores
park
i
suddenly
saw
her
as
she
was
she
was
totally
that
is
to
say
hot
it
was
like
looking
at
that
picture
of
a
vase
and
noticing
that
it
was
also
two
faces
i
could
see
that
van
was
just
van
but
i
could
also
see
that
she
was
hella
pretty
something
i
never
noticed
of
course
darryl
had
known
it
all
along
and
do
think
that
i
was
bummed
out
anew
when
i
realized
this
you
ca
tell
your
dad
you
know
she
said
you
put
us
all
at
risk
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
chest
was
rising
up
and
down
with
her
breath
which
was
distracting
in
a
really
embarrassing
way
yeah
i
said
glumly
but
the
problem
is
that
i
know
he
just
totally
full
of
it
if
you
pulled
my
dad
over
and
made
him
prove
he
was
a
terrorist
he
go
berserk
totally
he
hates
being
put
on
hold
when
he
calls
about
his
bill
being
locked
in
the
back
of
a
car
and
questioned
for
an
hour
would
give
him
an
aneurism
they
only
get
away
with
it
because
the
normals
feel
smug
compared
to
the
abnormals
if
everyone
was
getting
pulled
over
it
be
a
disaster
no
one
would
ever
get
anywhere
they
all
be
waiting
to
get
questioned
by
the
cops
total
gridlock
woah
van
you
are
a
total
genius
i
said
tell
me
about
it
she
said
she
had
a
lazy
smile
and
she
looked
at
me
through
eyes
almost
romantic
seriously
we
can
do
this
we
can
mess
up
the
profiles
easily
getting
people
pulled
over
is
easy
she
sat
up
and
pushed
her
hair
off
her
face
and
looked
at
me
i
felt
a
little
flip
in
my
stomach
thinking
that
she
was
really
impressed
with
me
it
the
arphid
cloners
i
said
they
totally
easy
to
make
just
flash
the
firmware
on
a
radio
shack
and
you
done
what
we
do
is
go
around
and
randomly
swap
the
tags
on
people
overwriting
their
fast
passes
and
fastraks
with
other
people
codes
that
make
skew
all
weird
and
screwy
and
make
everyone
look
guilty
then
total
gridlock
van
pursed
her
lips
and
lowered
her
shades
and
i
realized
she
was
so
angry
she
could
speak
good
bye
marcus
she
said
and
got
to
her
feet
before
i
knew
it
she
was
walking
away
so
fast
she
was
practically
running
van
i
called
getting
to
my
feet
and
chasing
after
her
van
wait
she
picked
up
speed
making
me
run
to
catch
up
with
her
van
what
the
hell
i
said
catching
her
arm
she
jerked
it
away
so
hard
i
punched
myself
in
the
face
you
psycho
marcus
you
going
to
put
all
your
little
xnet
buddies
in
danger
for
their
lives
and
on
top
of
it
you
going
to
turn
the
whole
city
into
terrorism
suspects
ca
you
stop
before
you
hurt
these
people
i
opened
and
closed
my
mouth
a
couple
times
van
not
the
problem
are
i
not
arresting
people
jailing
them
making
them
disappear
the
department
of
homeland
security
are
the
ones
doing
that
i
fighting
back
to
make
them
stop
how
by
making
it
worse
maybe
it
has
to
get
worse
to
get
better
van
is
that
what
you
were
saying
if
everyone
was
getting
pulled
over
that
not
what
i
meant
i
did
mean
you
should
get
everyone
arrested
if
you
want
to
protest
join
the
protest
movement
do
something
positive
did
you
learn
from
darryl
you
damned
right
i
did
i
said
losing
my
cool
i
learned
that
they
ca
be
trusted
that
if
you
not
fighting
them
you
helping
them
that
they
turn
the
country
into
a
prison
if
we
let
them
what
did
you
learn
van
to
be
scared
all
the
time
to
sit
tight
and
keep
your
head
down
and
hope
you
do
get
noticed
you
think
it
going
to
get
better
if
we
do
do
anything
this
is
as
as
it
going
to
it
will
only
get
worse
and
worse
from
now
on
you
want
to
help
darryl
help
me
bring
them
down
there
it
was
again
my
vow
not
to
get
darryl
free
but
to
bring
down
the
entire
dhs
that
was
crazy
even
i
knew
it
but
it
was
what
i
planned
to
do
no
question
about
it
van
shoved
me
hard
with
both
hands
she
was
strong
from
school
athletics
fencing
lacrosse
field
hockey
all
the
sports
and
i
ended
up
on
my
ass
on
the
disgusting
san
francisco
sidewalk
she
took
off
and
i
did
follow
the
important
thing
about
security
systems
is
how
they
work
it
how
they
fail
that
was
the
first
line
of
my
first
blog
post
on
open
revolt
my
xnet
site
i
was
writing
as
and
i
was
ready
to
go
to
war
maybe
all
the
automatic
screening
is
supposed
to
catch
terrorists
maybe
it
will
catch
a
terrorist
sooner
or
later
the
problem
is
that
it
catches
too
even
though
we
not
doing
anything
wrong
the
more
people
it
catches
the
more
brittle
it
gets
if
it
catches
too
many
people
it
dies
get
the
idea
i
pasted
in
my
howto
for
building
a
arphid
cloner
and
some
tips
for
getting
close
enough
to
people
to
read
and
write
their
tags
i
put
my
own
cloner
in
the
pocket
of
my
vintage
black
leather
motocross
jacket
with
the
armored
pockets
and
left
for
school
i
managed
to
clone
six
tags
between
home
and
chavez
high
it
was
war
they
wanted
it
was
war
they
get
if
you
ever
decide
to
do
something
as
stupid
as
build
an
automatic
terrorism
detector
here
a
math
lesson
you
need
to
learn
first
it
called
the
paradox
of
the
false
positive
and
it
a
doozy
say
you
have
a
new
disease
called
only
one
in
a
million
people
gets
you
develop
a
test
for
that
percent
accurate
i
mean
percent
of
the
time
it
gives
the
correct
result
true
if
the
subject
is
infected
and
false
if
the
subject
is
healthy
you
give
the
test
to
a
million
people
one
in
a
million
people
have
one
in
a
hundred
people
that
you
test
will
generate
a
false
positive
the
test
will
say
he
has
even
though
he
does
that
what
percent
accurate
means
one
percent
wrong
what
one
percent
of
one
million
one
in
a
million
people
has
if
you
test
a
million
random
people
you
probably
only
find
one
case
of
real
but
your
test
wo
identify
person
as
having
it
will
identify
people
as
having
it
your
percent
accurate
test
will
perform
with
percent
that
the
paradox
of
the
false
positive
when
you
try
to
find
something
really
rare
your
test
accuracy
has
to
match
the
rarity
of
the
thing
you
looking
for
if
you
trying
to
point
at
a
single
pixel
on
your
screen
a
sharp
pencil
is
a
good
pointer
the
is
a
lot
smaller
more
accurate
than
the
pixels
but
a
is
no
good
at
pointing
at
a
single
in
your
screen
for
that
you
need
a
pointer
a
test
that
one
atom
wide
or
less
at
the
tip
this
is
the
paradox
of
the
false
positive
and
here
how
it
applies
to
terrorism
terrorists
are
really
rare
in
a
city
of
twenty
million
like
new
york
there
might
be
one
or
two
terrorists
maybe
ten
of
them
at
the
outside
percent
one
of
a
percent
that
pretty
rare
all
right
now
say
you
got
some
software
that
can
sift
through
all
the
or
records
or
public
transit
records
or
records
in
the
city
and
catch
terrorists
percent
of
the
time
in
a
pool
of
twenty
million
people
a
percent
accurate
test
will
identify
two
hundred
thousand
people
as
being
terrorists
but
only
ten
of
them
are
terrorists
to
catch
ten
bad
guys
you
have
to
haul
in
and
investigate
two
hundred
thousand
innocent
people
guess
what
terrorism
tests
are
anywhere
to
percent
accurate
more
like
percent
accurate
even
percent
accurate
sometimes
what
this
all
meant
was
that
the
department
of
homeland
security
had
set
itself
up
to
fail
badly
they
were
trying
to
spot
incredibly
rare
events
a
person
is
a
terrorist
with
inaccurate
systems
is
it
any
wonder
we
were
able
to
make
such
a
mess
i
stepped
out
the
front
door
whistling
on
a
tuesday
morning
one
week
into
the
operation
false
positive
i
was
rockin
out
to
some
new
music
i
downloaded
from
the
xnet
the
night
before
lots
of
people
sent
little
digital
gifts
to
say
thank
you
for
giving
them
hope
i
turned
onto
street
and
carefully
took
the
narrow
stone
steps
cut
into
the
side
of
the
hill
as
i
descended
i
passed
mr
wiener
dog
i
do
know
mr
wiener
dog
real
name
but
i
see
him
nearly
every
day
walking
his
three
panting
wiener
dogs
up
the
staircase
to
the
little
parkette
squeezing
past
them
all
on
the
stairs
is
pretty
much
impossible
and
i
always
end
up
tangled
in
a
leash
knocked
into
someone
front
garden
or
perched
on
the
bumper
of
one
of
the
cars
parked
next
to
the
curb
mr
wiener
dog
is
clearly
someone
important
because
he
has
a
fancy
watch
and
always
wears
a
nice
suit
i
had
mentally
assumed
that
he
worked
down
in
the
financial
district
today
as
i
brushed
up
against
him
i
triggered
my
arphid
cloner
which
was
already
loaded
in
the
pocket
of
my
leather
jacket
the
cloner
sucked
down
the
numbers
off
his
and
his
his
passport
and
the
bills
in
his
wallet
even
as
it
was
doing
that
it
was
flashing
some
of
them
with
new
numbers
taken
from
other
people
i
brushed
against
it
was
like
switching
the
on
a
bunch
of
cars
but
invisible
and
instantaneous
i
smiled
apologetically
at
mr
wiener
dog
and
continued
down
the
stairs
i
stopped
at
three
of
the
cars
long
enough
to
swap
their
fastrak
tags
with
numbers
taken
off
of
all
the
cars
i
gone
past
the
day
before
you
might
think
i
was
being
a
little
aggro
here
but
i
was
cautious
and
conservative
compared
to
a
lot
of
the
xnetters
a
couple
girls
in
the
chemical
engineering
program
at
uc
berkeley
had
figured
out
how
to
make
a
harmless
substance
out
of
kitchen
products
that
would
trip
an
explosive
sniffer
they
had
a
merry
time
sprinkling
it
on
their
profs
briefcases
and
jackets
then
hiding
out
and
watching
the
same
profs
try
to
get
into
the
auditoriums
and
libraries
on
campus
only
to
get
by
the
new
security
squads
that
had
sprung
up
everywhere
other
people
wanted
to
figure
out
how
to
dust
envelopes
with
substances
that
would
test
positive
for
anthrax
but
everyone
else
thought
they
were
out
of
their
minds
luckily
it
did
seem
like
they
be
able
to
figure
it
out
i
passed
by
san
francisco
general
hospital
and
nodded
with
satisfaction
as
i
saw
the
huge
lines
at
the
front
doors
they
had
a
police
checkpoint
too
of
course
and
there
were
enough
xnetters
working
as
interns
and
cafeteria
workers
and
whatnot
there
that
everyone
badges
had
been
snarled
up
and
swapped
around
i
read
the
security
checks
had
tacked
an
hour
onto
everyone
work
day
and
the
unions
were
threatening
to
walk
out
unless
the
hospital
did
something
about
it
a
few
blocks
later
i
saw
an
even
longer
line
for
the
bart
cops
were
walking
up
and
down
the
line
pointing
people
out
and
calling
them
aside
for
questioning
and
they
kept
getting
sued
for
doing
this
but
it
did
seem
to
be
slowing
them
down
i
got
to
school
a
little
ahead
of
time
and
decided
to
walk
down
to
street
to
get
a
coffee
and
i
passed
a
police
checkpoint
where
they
were
pulling
over
cars
for
secondary
inspection
school
was
no
less
wild
the
security
guards
on
the
metal
detectors
were
also
wanding
our
school
ids
and
pulling
out
students
with
odd
movements
for
questioning
needless
to
say
we
all
had
pretty
weird
movements
needless
to
say
classes
were
starting
an
hour
or
more
later
classes
were
crazy
i
do
think
anyone
was
able
to
concentrate
i
overheard
two
teachers
talking
about
how
long
it
had
taken
them
to
get
home
from
work
the
day
before
and
planning
to
sneak
out
early
that
day
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
laughing
the
paradox
of
the
false
positive
strikes
again
sure
enough
they
let
us
out
of
class
early
and
i
headed
home
the
long
way
circling
through
the
mission
to
see
the
havoc
long
lines
of
cars
bart
stations
lined
up
around
the
blocks
people
swearing
at
atms
that
would
dispense
their
money
because
they
had
their
accounts
frozen
for
suspicious
activity
that
the
danger
of
wiring
your
checking
account
straight
into
your
fastrak
and
fast
pass
i
got
home
and
made
myself
a
sandwich
and
logged
into
the
xnet
it
had
been
a
good
day
people
from
all
over
town
were
crowing
about
their
successes
we
brought
the
city
of
san
francisco
to
a
standstill
the
confirmed
it
they
were
calling
it
the
dhs
gone
haywire
blaming
it
all
on
the
security
that
was
supposed
to
be
protecting
us
from
terrorism
the
business
section
of
the
san
francisco
chronicle
gave
its
whole
front
page
to
an
estimate
of
the
economic
cost
of
the
dhs
security
resulting
from
missed
work
hours
meetings
and
so
on
according
to
the
chronicle
economist
a
week
of
this
crap
would
cost
the
city
more
than
the
bay
bridge
bombing
had
the
best
part
dad
got
home
that
night
late
very
late
three
late
why
because
he
been
pulled
over
searched
questioned
then
it
happened
twice
twice
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
compass
inc
the
oldest
independent
bookstore
in
the
western
usa
they
got
stores
up
and
down
california
in
san
francisco
burlingame
mountain
view
and
palo
alto
but
coolest
of
all
is
that
they
run
a
killer
bookstore
in
the
middle
of
disneyland
downtown
disney
in
anaheim
i
a
stone
disney
park
freak
see
my
first
novel
down
and
out
in
the
magic
kingdom
if
you
do
believe
it
and
every
time
i
lived
in
california
i
bought
myself
an
annual
disneyland
pass
and
on
practically
every
visit
i
drop
by
compass
books
in
downtown
disney
they
stock
a
brilliant
selection
of
unauthorized
and
even
critical
books
about
disney
as
well
as
a
great
variety
of
kids
books
and
science
fiction
and
the
cafe
next
door
makes
a
mean
cappuccino
compass
inc
http
he
was
so
angry
i
thought
he
was
going
to
pop
you
know
i
said
i
only
seen
him
lose
his
cool
rarely
that
night
he
lost
it
more
than
he
ever
had
you
would
believe
it
this
cop
he
was
like
eighteen
years
old
and
he
kept
saying
sir
why
were
you
in
berkeley
yesterday
if
your
client
is
in
mountain
view
i
kept
explaining
to
him
that
i
teach
at
berkeley
and
then
he
say
thought
you
were
a
consultant
and
we
start
over
again
it
was
like
some
kind
of
sitcom
where
the
cops
have
been
taken
over
by
the
stupidity
ray
what
worse
was
he
kept
insisting
that
i
been
in
berkeley
today
as
well
and
i
kept
saying
no
i
had
been
and
he
said
i
had
been
then
he
showed
me
my
fastrak
billing
and
it
said
i
driven
the
san
mateo
bridge
three
times
that
day
that
not
all
he
said
and
drew
in
a
breath
that
let
me
know
he
was
really
steamed
they
had
information
about
where
i
been
places
that
have
a
toll
they
been
polling
my
pass
just
on
the
street
at
random
and
it
was
holy
crap
i
mean
they
spying
on
us
all
and
they
not
even
competent
i
drifted
down
into
the
kitchen
as
he
railed
there
and
now
i
was
watching
him
from
the
doorway
mom
met
my
eye
and
we
both
raised
our
eyebrows
as
if
to
say
going
to
say
told
you
so
to
him
i
nodded
at
her
she
could
use
her
spousular
powers
to
nullify
his
rage
in
a
way
that
was
out
of
my
reach
as
a
mere
filial
unit
drew
she
said
and
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
to
make
him
stop
stalking
back
and
forth
in
the
kitchen
waving
his
arms
like
a
what
he
snapped
i
think
you
owe
marcus
an
apology
she
kept
her
voice
even
and
level
dad
and
i
are
the
spazzes
in
the
household
mom
a
total
rock
dad
looked
at
me
his
eyes
narrowed
as
he
thought
for
a
minute
all
right
he
said
at
last
you
right
i
was
talking
about
competent
surveillance
these
guys
were
total
amateurs
i
sorry
son
he
said
you
were
right
that
was
ridiculous
he
stuck
his
hand
out
and
shook
my
hand
then
gave
me
a
firm
unexpected
hug
god
what
are
we
doing
to
this
country
marcus
your
generation
deserves
to
inherit
something
better
than
this
when
he
let
me
go
i
could
see
the
deep
wrinkles
in
his
face
lines
i
never
noticed
i
went
back
up
to
my
room
and
played
some
xnet
games
there
was
a
good
multiplayer
thing
a
clockwork
pirate
game
where
you
had
to
quest
every
day
or
two
to
wind
up
your
whole
crew
mainsprings
before
you
could
go
plundering
and
pillaging
again
it
was
the
kind
of
game
i
hated
but
could
stop
playing
lots
of
repetitive
quests
that
were
all
that
satisfying
to
complete
a
little
bit
of
combat
scrapping
to
see
who
would
captain
the
ship
and
not
that
many
cool
puzzles
that
you
had
to
figure
out
mostly
playing
this
kind
of
game
made
me
homesick
for
harajuku
fun
madness
which
balanced
out
running
around
in
the
real
world
figuring
out
online
puzzles
and
strategizing
with
your
team
but
today
it
was
just
what
i
needed
mindless
entertainment
my
poor
dad
i
done
that
to
him
he
been
happy
before
confident
that
his
tax
dollars
were
being
spent
to
keep
him
safe
i
destroyed
that
confidence
it
was
false
confidence
of
course
but
it
had
kept
him
going
seeing
him
now
miserable
and
broken
i
wondered
if
it
was
better
to
be
and
hopeless
or
to
live
in
a
fool
paradise
that
shame
the
shame
i
felt
since
i
gave
up
my
passwords
since
they
broken
me
returned
leaving
me
listless
and
wanting
to
just
get
away
from
myself
my
character
was
a
swabbie
on
the
pirate
ship
and
he
wound
down
while
i
been
offline
i
had
to
im
all
the
other
players
on
my
ship
until
i
found
one
willing
to
wind
me
up
that
kept
me
occupied
i
liked
it
actually
there
was
something
magic
about
a
total
stranger
doing
you
a
favor
and
since
it
was
the
xnet
i
knew
that
all
the
strangers
were
friends
in
some
sense
where
u
located
the
character
who
wound
me
up
was
called
lizanator
and
it
was
female
though
that
did
mean
that
it
was
a
girl
guys
had
some
weird
affinity
for
playing
female
characters
san
francisco
i
said
no
stupe
where
you
located
in
san
fran
why
you
a
pervert
that
usually
shut
down
that
line
of
conversation
of
course
every
gamespace
was
full
of
pedos
and
pervs
and
cops
pretending
to
be
and
though
i
sure
hoped
there
were
any
cops
on
the
xnet
an
accusation
like
that
was
enough
to
change
the
subject
nine
out
of
ten
times
mission
potrero
hill
noe
east
bay
just
wind
me
up
k
thx
she
stopped
winding
you
scared
safe
why
do
you
care
just
curious
i
was
getting
a
bad
vibe
off
her
she
was
clearly
more
than
just
curious
call
it
paranoia
i
logged
off
and
shut
down
my
xbox
dad
looked
at
me
over
the
table
the
next
morning
and
said
it
looks
like
it
going
to
get
better
at
least
he
handed
me
a
copy
of
the
open
to
the
third
page
a
department
of
homeland
security
spokesman
has
confirmed
that
the
san
francisco
office
has
requested
a
percent
budget
and
personnel
increase
from
dc
what
major
general
graeme
sutherland
the
commanding
officer
for
northern
california
dhs
operations
confirmed
the
request
at
a
press
conference
yesterday
noting
that
a
spike
in
suspicious
activity
in
the
bay
area
prompted
the
request
we
are
tracking
a
spike
in
underground
chatter
and
activity
and
believe
that
saboteurs
are
deliberately
manufacturing
false
security
alerts
to
undermine
our
efforts
my
eyes
crossed
no
freaking
way
these
false
alarms
are
potentially
chaff
intended
to
disguise
real
attacks
the
only
effective
way
of
combatting
them
is
to
step
up
staffing
and
analyst
levels
so
that
we
can
fully
investigate
every
lead
sutherland
noted
the
delays
experienced
all
over
the
city
were
unfortunate
and
committed
to
eliminating
them
i
had
a
vision
of
the
city
with
four
or
five
times
as
many
dhs
enforcers
brought
in
to
make
up
for
my
own
stupid
ideas
van
was
right
the
more
i
fought
them
the
worse
it
was
going
to
get
dad
pointed
at
the
paper
these
guys
may
be
fools
but
they
methodical
fools
they
just
keep
throwing
resources
at
this
problem
until
they
solve
it
it
tractable
you
know
mining
all
the
data
in
the
city
following
up
on
every
lead
they
catch
the
terrorists
i
lost
it
dad
are
you
to
they
talking
about
investigating
practically
every
person
in
the
city
of
san
francisco
yeah
he
said
that
right
they
catch
every
alimony
cheat
every
dope
dealer
every
and
every
terrorist
you
just
wait
this
could
be
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
this
country
tell
me
you
joking
i
said
i
beg
you
you
think
that
that
what
they
intended
when
they
wrote
the
constitution
what
about
the
bill
of
rights
the
bill
of
rights
was
written
before
he
said
he
was
awesomely
serene
convinced
of
his
rightness
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
is
fine
but
why
should
the
cops
be
allowed
to
mine
your
social
network
to
figure
out
if
you
hanging
out
with
gangbangers
and
terrorists
because
it
an
invasion
of
my
privacy
i
said
what
the
big
deal
would
you
rather
have
privacy
or
terrorists
agh
i
hated
arguing
with
my
dad
like
this
i
needed
a
coffee
dad
come
on
taking
away
our
privacy
is
catching
terrorists
it
just
inconveniencing
normal
people
how
do
you
know
it
not
catching
terrorists
where
are
the
terrorists
they
caught
i
sure
we
see
arrests
in
good
time
you
just
wait
dad
what
the
hell
has
happened
to
you
since
last
night
you
were
ready
to
go
nuclear
on
the
cops
for
pulling
you
over
do
use
that
tone
with
me
marcus
what
happened
since
last
night
is
that
i
had
the
chance
to
think
it
over
and
to
read
he
rattled
his
paper
the
reason
they
caught
me
is
that
the
bad
guys
are
actively
jamming
them
they
need
to
adjust
their
techniques
to
overcome
the
jamming
but
they
get
there
meanwhile
the
occasional
road
stop
is
a
small
price
to
pay
this
is
the
time
to
be
playing
lawyer
about
the
bill
of
rights
this
is
the
time
to
make
some
sacrifices
to
keep
our
city
safe
i
could
finish
my
toast
i
put
the
plate
in
the
dishwasher
and
left
for
school
i
had
to
get
out
of
there
the
xnetters
were
happy
about
the
stepped
up
police
surveillance
but
they
were
going
to
take
it
lying
down
someone
called
a
show
on
kqed
and
told
them
that
the
police
were
wasting
their
time
that
we
could
monkeywrench
the
system
faster
than
they
could
untangle
it
the
recording
was
a
top
xnet
download
that
night
this
is
california
live
and
we
talking
to
an
anonymous
caller
at
a
payphone
in
san
francisco
he
has
his
own
information
about
the
slowdowns
we
been
facing
around
town
this
week
caller
you
on
the
air
yeah
yo
this
is
just
the
beginning
you
know
i
mean
like
we
just
getting
started
let
them
hire
a
billion
pigs
and
put
a
checkpoint
on
every
corner
we
jam
them
all
and
like
all
this
crap
about
terrorists
we
not
terrorists
give
me
a
break
i
mean
really
we
jamming
up
the
system
because
we
hate
the
homeland
security
and
because
we
love
our
city
terrorists
i
ca
even
spell
jihad
peace
out
he
sounded
like
an
idiot
not
just
the
incoherent
words
but
also
his
gloating
tone
he
sounded
like
a
kid
who
was
indecently
proud
of
himself
he
a
kid
who
was
indecently
proud
of
himself
the
xnet
flamed
out
over
this
lots
of
people
thought
he
was
an
idiot
for
calling
in
while
others
thought
he
was
a
hero
i
worried
that
there
was
probably
a
camera
aimed
at
the
payphone
he
used
or
an
arphid
reader
that
might
have
sniffed
his
fast
pass
i
hoped
he
had
the
smarts
to
wipe
his
fingerprints
off
the
quarter
keep
his
hood
up
and
leave
all
his
arphids
at
home
but
i
doubted
it
i
wondered
if
he
get
a
knock
on
the
door
sometime
soon
the
way
i
knew
when
something
big
had
happened
on
xnet
was
that
i
suddenly
get
a
million
emails
from
people
who
wanted
to
know
about
the
latest
haps
it
was
just
as
i
was
reading
about
mr
that
my
mailbox
went
crazy
everyone
had
a
message
for
me
a
link
to
a
livejournal
on
the
xnet
one
of
the
many
anonymous
blogs
that
were
based
on
the
freenet
document
publishing
system
that
was
also
used
by
chinese
democracy
advocates
close
call
we
were
jamming
at
the
embarcadero
tonite
and
goofing
around
giving
everyone
a
new
car
key
or
door
key
or
fast
pass
or
fastrak
tossing
around
a
little
fake
gunpowder
there
were
cops
everywhere
but
we
were
smarter
than
them
we
there
pretty
much
every
night
and
we
never
get
caught
so
we
got
caught
tonight
it
was
a
stupid
mistake
we
got
sloppy
we
got
busted
it
was
an
undercover
who
caught
my
pal
and
then
got
the
rest
of
us
they
been
watching
the
crowd
for
a
long
time
and
they
had
one
of
those
trucks
nearby
and
they
took
four
of
us
in
but
missed
the
rest
the
truck
was
jammed
like
a
can
of
sardines
with
every
kind
of
person
old
young
black
white
rich
poor
all
suspects
and
there
were
two
cops
trying
to
ask
us
questions
and
the
undercovers
kept
bringing
in
more
of
us
most
people
were
trying
to
get
to
the
front
of
the
line
to
get
through
questioning
so
we
kept
on
moving
back
and
it
was
like
hours
in
there
and
really
hot
and
it
was
getting
more
crowded
not
less
at
like
they
changed
shifts
and
two
new
cops
came
in
and
bawled
out
the
two
cops
who
were
there
all
like
wtf
are
you
doing
anything
here
they
had
a
real
fight
and
then
the
two
old
cops
left
and
the
new
cops
sat
down
at
their
desks
and
whispered
to
each
other
for
a
while
then
one
cop
stood
up
and
started
shouting
everyone
just
go
home
jesus
christ
we
got
better
things
to
do
than
bother
you
with
more
questions
if
you
done
something
wrong
just
do
do
it
again
and
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
all
a
bunch
of
the
suits
got
really
pissed
which
was
hilarious
because
i
mean
ten
minutes
before
they
were
buggin
about
being
held
there
and
now
they
were
wicked
pissed
about
being
let
go
like
make
up
your
minds
we
split
fast
though
and
got
out
and
came
home
to
write
this
there
are
undercovers
everywhere
believe
if
you
jamming
be
and
get
ready
to
run
when
problems
happen
if
you
get
caught
try
to
wait
it
out
they
so
busy
they
maybe
just
let
you
go
we
made
them
that
busy
all
those
people
in
that
truck
were
there
because
we
jammed
them
so
jam
on
i
felt
like
i
was
going
to
throw
up
those
four
people
kids
i
never
met
they
nearly
went
away
forever
because
of
something
i
started
because
of
something
i
told
them
to
do
i
was
no
better
than
a
terrorist
the
dhs
got
their
budget
requisition
approved
the
president
went
on
tv
with
the
governor
to
tell
us
that
no
price
was
too
high
for
security
we
had
to
watch
it
the
next
day
in
school
at
assembly
my
dad
cheered
he
hated
the
president
since
the
day
he
was
elected
saying
he
was
any
better
than
the
last
guy
and
the
last
guy
had
been
a
complete
disaster
but
now
all
he
could
do
was
talk
about
how
decisive
and
dynamic
the
new
guy
was
you
have
to
take
it
easy
on
your
father
mom
said
to
me
one
night
after
i
got
home
from
school
she
been
working
from
home
as
much
as
possible
mom
a
freelance
relocation
specialist
who
helps
british
people
get
settled
in
in
san
francisco
the
uk
high
commission
pays
her
to
answer
emails
from
mystified
british
people
across
the
country
who
are
totally
confused
by
how
freaky
we
americans
are
she
explains
americans
for
a
living
and
she
said
that
these
days
it
was
better
to
do
that
from
home
where
she
did
have
to
actually
see
any
americans
or
talk
to
them
i
do
have
any
illusions
about
britain
america
may
be
willing
to
trash
its
constitution
every
time
some
jihadist
looks
at
us
but
as
i
learned
in
my
social
studies
independent
project
the
brits
do
even
a
constitution
they
got
laws
there
that
would
curl
the
hair
on
your
toes
they
can
put
you
in
jail
for
an
entire
year
if
they
really
sure
that
you
a
terrorist
but
do
have
enough
evidence
to
prove
it
now
how
sure
can
they
be
if
they
do
have
enough
evidence
to
prove
it
how
they
get
that
sure
did
they
see
you
committing
terrorist
acts
in
a
really
vivid
dream
and
the
surveillance
in
britain
makes
america
look
like
amateur
hour
the
average
londoner
is
photographed
times
a
day
just
walking
around
the
streets
every
license
plate
is
photographed
at
every
corner
in
the
country
everyone
from
the
banks
to
the
public
transit
company
is
enthusiastic
about
tracking
you
and
snitching
on
you
if
they
think
you
remotely
suspicious
but
mom
did
see
it
that
way
she
left
britain
halfway
through
high
school
and
she
never
felt
at
home
here
no
matter
that
she
married
a
boy
from
petaluma
and
raised
a
son
here
to
her
this
was
always
the
land
of
barbarians
and
britain
would
always
be
home
mom
he
just
wrong
you
of
all
people
should
know
that
everything
that
makes
this
country
great
is
being
flushed
down
the
toilet
and
he
going
along
with
it
have
you
noticed
that
they
have
any
dad
all
like
need
to
be
safe
but
he
needs
to
know
that
most
of
us
do
feel
safe
we
feel
endangered
all
the
time
i
know
this
all
marcus
believe
me
i
not
fan
of
what
been
happening
to
this
country
but
your
father
is
she
broke
off
when
you
did
come
home
after
the
attacks
he
thought
she
got
up
and
made
herself
a
cup
of
tea
something
she
did
whenever
she
was
uncomfortable
or
disconcerted
marcus
she
said
marcus
we
thought
you
were
dead
do
you
understand
that
we
were
mourning
you
for
days
we
were
imagining
you
blown
to
bits
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
dead
because
some
bastard
decided
to
kill
hundreds
of
strangers
to
make
some
point
that
sank
in
slowly
i
mean
i
understood
that
they
been
worried
lots
of
people
died
in
the
bombings
four
thousand
was
the
present
estimate
and
practically
everyone
knew
someone
who
did
come
home
that
day
there
were
two
people
from
my
school
who
had
disappeared
your
father
was
ready
to
kill
someone
anyone
he
was
out
of
his
mind
you
never
seen
him
like
this
i
never
seen
him
like
it
either
he
was
out
of
his
mind
he
just
sit
at
this
table
and
curse
and
curse
and
curse
vile
words
words
i
never
heard
him
say
one
day
the
third
day
someone
called
and
he
was
sure
it
was
you
but
it
was
a
wrong
number
and
he
threw
the
phone
so
hard
it
disintegrated
into
thousands
of
pieces
i
wondered
about
the
new
kitchen
phone
something
broke
in
your
father
he
loves
you
we
both
love
you
you
are
the
most
important
thing
in
our
lives
i
do
think
you
realize
that
do
you
remember
when
you
were
ten
when
i
went
home
to
london
for
all
that
time
do
you
remember
i
nodded
silently
we
were
ready
to
get
a
divorce
marcus
oh
it
does
matter
why
anymore
it
was
just
a
bad
patch
the
kind
of
thing
that
happens
when
people
who
love
each
other
stop
paying
attention
for
a
few
years
he
came
and
got
me
and
convinced
me
to
come
back
for
you
we
could
bear
the
thought
of
doing
that
to
you
we
fell
in
love
again
for
you
we
together
today
because
of
you
i
had
a
lump
in
my
throat
i
never
known
this
no
one
had
ever
told
me
so
your
father
is
having
a
hard
time
right
now
he
not
in
his
right
mind
it
going
to
take
some
time
before
he
comes
back
to
us
before
he
the
man
i
love
again
we
need
to
understand
him
until
then
she
gave
me
a
long
hug
and
i
noticed
how
thin
her
arms
had
gotten
how
saggy
the
skin
on
her
neck
was
i
always
thought
of
my
mother
as
young
pale
and
cheerful
peering
shrewdly
through
her
glasses
now
she
looked
a
little
like
an
old
woman
i
had
done
that
to
her
the
terrorists
had
done
that
to
her
the
department
of
homeland
security
had
done
that
to
her
in
a
weird
way
we
were
all
on
the
same
side
and
mom
and
dad
and
all
those
people
we
spoofed
were
on
the
other
side
i
could
sleep
that
night
mom
words
kept
running
through
my
head
dad
had
been
tense
and
quiet
at
dinner
and
we
barely
spoken
because
i
did
trust
myself
not
to
say
the
wrong
thing
and
because
he
was
all
wound
up
over
the
latest
news
that
al
qaeda
was
definitely
responsible
for
the
bombing
six
different
terrorist
groups
had
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
but
only
al
qaeda
internet
video
disclosed
information
that
the
dhs
said
they
had
disclosed
to
anyone
i
lay
in
bed
and
listened
to
a
radio
show
the
topic
was
sex
problems
with
this
gay
guy
who
i
normally
loved
to
listen
to
he
would
give
people
such
raw
advice
but
good
advice
and
he
was
really
funny
and
campy
tonight
i
could
laugh
most
of
the
callers
wanted
to
ask
what
to
do
about
the
fact
that
they
were
having
a
hard
time
getting
busy
with
their
partners
ever
since
the
attack
even
on
radio
i
could
get
away
from
the
topic
i
switched
the
radio
off
and
heard
a
purring
engine
on
the
street
below
my
bedroom
is
in
the
top
floor
of
our
house
one
of
the
painted
ladies
i
have
a
sloping
attic
ceiling
and
windows
on
both
sides
one
overlooks
the
whole
mission
the
other
looks
out
into
the
street
in
front
of
our
place
there
were
often
cars
cruising
at
all
hours
of
the
night
but
there
was
something
different
about
this
engine
noise
i
went
to
the
and
pulled
up
my
blinds
down
on
the
street
below
me
was
a
white
unmarked
van
whose
roof
was
festooned
with
radio
antennas
more
antennas
than
i
ever
seen
on
a
car
it
was
cruising
very
slowly
down
the
street
a
little
dish
on
top
spinning
around
and
around
as
i
watched
the
van
stopped
and
one
of
the
back
doors
popped
open
a
guy
in
a
dhs
uniform
i
could
spot
one
from
a
hundred
yards
now
stepped
out
into
the
street
he
had
some
kind
of
handheld
device
and
its
blue
glow
lit
his
face
he
paced
back
and
forth
first
scouting
my
neighbors
making
notes
on
his
device
then
heading
for
me
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
way
he
walked
looking
down
he
was
using
a
wifinder
the
dhs
was
scouting
for
xnet
nodes
i
let
go
of
the
blinds
and
dove
across
my
room
for
my
xbox
i
left
it
up
while
i
downloaded
some
cool
animations
one
of
the
xnetters
had
made
of
the
president
speech
i
yanked
the
plug
out
of
the
wall
then
scurried
back
to
the
window
and
cracked
the
blind
a
fraction
of
an
inch
the
guy
was
looking
down
into
his
wifinder
again
walking
back
and
forth
in
front
of
our
house
a
moment
later
he
got
back
into
his
van
and
drove
away
i
got
out
my
camera
and
took
as
many
pictures
as
i
could
of
the
van
and
its
antennas
then
i
opened
them
in
a
free
called
the
gimp
and
edited
out
everything
from
the
photo
except
the
van
erasing
my
street
and
anything
that
might
identify
me
i
posted
them
to
xnet
and
wrote
down
everything
i
could
about
the
vans
these
guys
were
definitely
looking
for
the
xnet
i
could
tell
now
i
really
could
sleep
nothing
for
it
but
to
play
pirates
there
be
lots
of
players
even
at
this
hour
the
real
name
for
pirates
was
clockwork
plunder
and
it
was
a
hobbyist
project
that
had
been
created
by
teenaged
freaks
from
finland
it
was
totally
free
to
play
and
offered
just
as
much
fun
as
any
of
the
services
like
ender
universe
and
middle
earth
quest
and
discworld
dungeons
i
logged
back
in
and
there
i
was
still
on
the
deck
of
the
zombie
charger
waiting
for
someone
to
wind
me
up
i
hated
this
part
of
the
game
hey
you
i
typed
to
a
passing
pirate
wind
me
up
he
paused
and
looked
at
me
y
should
i
we
on
the
same
team
plus
you
get
experience
points
what
a
jerk
where
are
you
located
san
francisco
this
was
starting
to
feel
familiar
where
in
san
francisco
i
logged
out
there
was
something
weird
going
on
in
the
game
i
jumped
onto
the
livejournals
and
began
to
crawl
from
blog
to
blog
i
got
through
half
a
dozen
before
i
found
something
that
froze
my
blood
livejournallers
love
quizzes
what
kind
of
hobbit
are
you
are
you
a
great
lover
what
planet
are
you
most
like
which
character
from
some
movie
are
you
what
your
emotional
type
they
fill
them
in
and
their
friends
fill
them
in
and
everyone
compares
their
results
harmless
fun
but
the
quiz
that
had
taken
over
the
blogs
of
the
xnet
that
night
was
what
scared
me
because
it
was
anything
but
harmless
what
your
sex
what
grade
are
you
in
what
school
do
you
go
to
where
in
the
city
do
you
live
the
quizzes
plotted
the
results
on
a
map
with
colored
pushpins
for
schools
and
neighborhoods
and
made
lame
recommendations
for
places
to
buy
pizza
and
stuff
but
look
at
those
questions
think
about
my
answers
male
chavez
high
potrero
hill
there
were
only
two
people
in
my
whole
school
who
matched
that
profile
most
schools
it
would
be
the
same
if
you
wanted
to
figure
out
who
the
xnetters
were
you
could
use
these
quizzes
to
find
them
all
that
was
bad
enough
but
what
was
worse
was
what
it
implied
someone
from
the
dhs
was
using
the
xnet
to
get
at
us
the
xnet
was
compromised
by
the
dhs
we
had
spies
in
our
midst
i
given
xnet
discs
to
hundreds
of
people
and
they
done
the
same
i
knew
the
people
i
gave
the
discs
to
pretty
well
some
of
them
i
knew
very
well
i
lived
in
the
same
house
all
my
life
and
i
made
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
friends
over
the
years
from
people
who
went
to
daycare
with
me
to
people
i
played
soccer
with
people
who
larped
with
me
people
i
met
clubbing
people
i
knew
from
school
my
arg
team
were
my
closest
friends
but
there
were
plenty
of
people
i
knew
and
trusted
enough
to
hand
an
xnet
disc
to
i
needed
them
now
i
woke
jolu
up
by
ringing
his
cell
phone
and
hanging
up
after
the
first
ring
three
times
in
a
row
a
minute
later
he
was
up
on
xnet
and
we
were
able
to
have
a
secure
chat
i
pointed
him
to
my
on
the
radio
vans
and
he
came
back
a
minute
later
all
freaked
out
you
sure
they
looking
for
us
in
response
i
sent
him
to
the
quiz
omg
we
doomed
no
it
not
that
bad
but
we
need
to
figure
out
who
we
can
trust
how
that
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
how
many
people
can
you
totally
vouch
for
like
trust
them
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
um
or
or
so
i
want
to
get
a
bunch
of
really
trustworthy
people
together
and
do
a
web
of
trust
thing
web
of
trust
is
one
of
those
cool
crypto
things
that
i
read
about
but
never
tried
it
was
a
nearly
foolproof
way
to
make
sure
that
you
could
talk
to
the
people
you
trusted
but
that
no
one
else
could
listen
in
the
problem
is
that
it
requires
you
to
physically
meet
with
the
people
in
the
web
at
least
once
just
to
get
started
i
get
it
sure
that
not
bad
but
how
you
going
to
get
everyone
together
for
the
that
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
how
can
we
do
it
without
getting
busted
jolu
typed
some
words
and
erased
them
typed
more
and
erased
them
darryl
would
know
i
typed
god
this
was
the
stuff
he
was
great
at
jolu
did
type
anything
then
how
about
a
party
he
typed
how
about
if
we
all
get
together
somewhere
like
we
teenagers
having
a
party
and
that
way
we
have
a
excuse
if
anyone
shows
up
asking
us
what
we
doing
there
that
would
totally
work
you
a
genius
jolu
i
know
it
and
you
going
to
love
this
i
know
just
where
to
do
it
too

what
would
you
do
if
you
found
out
you
had
a
spy
in
your
midst
you
could
denounce
him
put
him
up
against
the
wall
and
take
him
out
but
then
you
might
end
up
with
another
spy
in
your
midst
and
the
new
spy
would
be
more
careful
than
the
last
one
and
maybe
not
get
caught
quite
so
readily
here
a
better
idea
start
intercepting
the
spy
communications
and
feed
him
and
his
masters
misinformation
say
his
masters
instruct
him
to
gather
information
on
your
movements
let
him
follow
you
around
and
take
all
the
notes
he
wants
but
steam
open
the
envelopes
that
he
sends
back
to
hq
and
replace
his
account
of
your
movements
with
a
fictitious
one
if
you
want
you
can
make
him
seem
erratic
and
unreliable
so
they
get
rid
of
him
you
can
manufacture
crises
that
might
make
one
side
or
the
other
reveal
the
identities
of
other
spies
in
short
you
own
them
this
is
called
the
attack
and
if
you
think
about
it
it
pretty
scary
someone
who
your
communications
can
trick
you
in
any
of
a
thousand
ways
of
course
there
a
great
way
to
get
around
the
attack
use
crypto
with
crypto
it
does
matter
if
the
enemy
can
see
your
messages
because
he
ca
decipher
them
change
them
and
them
that
one
of
the
main
reasons
to
use
crypto
but
remember
for
crypto
to
work
you
need
to
have
keys
for
the
people
you
want
to
talk
to
you
and
your
partner
need
to
share
a
secret
or
two
some
keys
that
you
can
use
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
your
messages
so
that
get
locked
out
that
where
the
idea
of
public
keys
comes
in
this
is
a
little
hairy
but
it
so
unbelievably
elegant
too
in
public
key
crypto
each
user
gets
two
keys
they
long
strings
of
mathematical
gibberish
and
they
have
an
almost
magic
property
whatever
you
scramble
with
one
key
the
other
will
unlock
and
what
more
they
the
keys
that
can
do
this
if
you
can
unscramble
a
message
with
one
key
you
it
was
scrambled
with
the
other
and
so
you
take
either
one
of
these
keys
it
does
matter
which
one
and
you
just
it
you
make
it
a
total
you
want
anyone
in
the
world
to
know
what
it
is
for
obvious
reasons
they
call
this
your
public
key
the
other
key
you
hide
in
the
darkest
reaches
of
your
mind
you
protect
it
with
your
life
you
never
let
anyone
ever
know
what
it
is
that
called
your
private
key
duh
now
say
you
a
spy
and
you
want
to
talk
with
your
bosses
their
public
key
is
known
by
everyone
your
public
key
is
known
by
everyone
no
one
knows
your
private
key
but
you
no
one
knows
their
private
key
but
them
you
want
to
send
them
a
message
first
you
encrypt
it
with
your
private
key
you
could
just
send
that
message
along
and
it
would
work
pretty
well
since
they
would
know
when
the
message
arrived
that
it
came
from
you
how
because
if
they
can
decrypt
it
with
your
public
key
it
can
have
been
encrypted
with
your
private
key
this
is
the
equivalent
of
putting
your
seal
or
signature
on
the
bottom
of
a
message
it
says
i
wrote
this
and
no
one
else
no
one
could
have
tampered
with
it
or
changed
it
unfortunately
this
wo
actually
keep
your
message
a
that
because
your
public
key
is
really
well
known
it
has
to
be
or
you
be
limited
to
sending
messages
to
those
few
people
who
have
your
public
key
anyone
who
intercepts
the
message
can
read
it
they
ca
change
it
and
make
it
seem
like
it
came
from
you
but
if
you
do
want
people
to
know
what
you
saying
you
need
a
better
solution
so
instead
of
just
encrypting
the
message
with
your
private
key
you
encrypt
it
with
your
boss
public
key
now
it
been
locked
twice
the
first
lock
the
boss
public
key
only
comes
off
when
combined
with
your
boss
private
key
the
second
lock
your
private
key
only
comes
off
with
your
public
key
when
your
bosses
receive
the
message
they
unlock
it
with
both
keys
and
now
they
know
for
sure
that
a
you
wrote
it
and
b
that
only
they
can
read
it
it
very
cool
the
day
i
discovered
it
darryl
and
i
immediately
exchanged
keys
and
spent
months
cackling
and
rubbing
our
hands
as
we
exchanged
our
secret
messages
about
where
to
meet
after
school
and
whether
van
would
ever
notice
him
but
if
you
want
to
understand
security
you
need
to
consider
the
most
paranoid
possibilities
like
what
if
i
tricked
you
into
thinking
that
public
key
was
your
boss
public
key
you
encrypt
the
message
with
your
private
key
and
my
public
key
i
decrypt
it
read
it
it
with
your
boss
public
key
and
send
it
on
as
far
as
your
boss
knows
no
one
but
you
could
have
written
the
message
and
no
one
but
him
could
have
read
it
and
i
get
to
sit
in
the
middle
like
a
fat
spider
in
a
web
and
all
your
secrets
belong
to
me
now
the
easiest
way
to
fix
this
is
to
really
widely
advertise
your
public
key
if
it
easy
for
anyone
to
know
what
your
real
key
is
gets
harder
and
harder
but
you
know
what
making
things
is
just
as
hard
as
keeping
them
secret
think
about
it
how
many
billions
of
dollars
are
spent
on
shampoo
ads
and
other
crap
just
to
make
sure
that
as
many
people
know
about
something
that
some
advertiser
wants
them
to
know
there
a
cheaper
way
of
fixing
the
web
of
trust
say
that
before
you
leave
hq
you
and
your
bosses
sit
down
over
coffee
and
actually
tell
each
other
your
keys
no
more
you
absolutely
certain
whose
keys
you
have
because
they
were
put
into
your
own
hands
so
far
so
good
but
there
a
natural
limit
to
this
how
many
people
can
you
physically
meet
with
and
swap
keys
how
many
hours
in
the
day
do
you
want
to
devote
to
the
equivalent
of
writing
your
own
phone
book
how
many
of
those
people
are
willing
to
devote
that
kind
of
time
to
you
thinking
about
this
like
a
phonebook
helps
the
world
was
once
a
place
with
a
lot
of
phonebooks
and
when
you
needed
a
number
you
could
look
it
up
in
the
book
but
for
many
of
the
numbers
that
you
wanted
to
refer
to
on
a
given
day
you
would
either
know
it
by
heart
or
you
be
able
to
ask
someone
else
even
today
when
i
out
with
my
i
ask
jolu
or
darryl
if
they
have
a
number
i
looking
for
it
faster
and
easier
than
looking
it
up
online
and
they
more
reliable
too
if
jolu
has
a
number
i
trust
him
so
i
trust
the
number
too
that
called
transitive
trust
trust
that
moves
across
the
web
of
our
relationships
a
web
of
trust
is
a
bigger
version
of
this
say
i
meet
jolu
and
get
his
key
i
can
put
it
on
my
keyring
a
list
of
keys
that
i
signed
with
my
private
key
that
means
you
can
unlock
it
with
my
public
key
and
know
for
sure
that
me
or
someone
with
my
key
anyway
says
that
this
key
belongs
to
this
guy
so
i
hand
you
my
keyring
and
provided
that
you
trust
me
to
have
actually
met
and
verified
all
the
keys
on
it
you
can
take
it
and
add
it
to
your
keyring
now
you
meet
someone
else
and
you
hand
the
whole
ring
to
him
bigger
and
bigger
the
ring
grows
and
provided
that
you
trust
the
next
guy
in
the
chain
and
he
trusts
the
next
guy
in
his
chain
and
so
on
you
pretty
secure
which
brings
me
to
keysigning
parties
these
are
what
they
sound
like
a
party
where
everyone
gets
together
and
signs
everyone
else
keys
darryl
and
i
when
we
traded
keys
that
was
kind
of
a
party
one
with
only
two
sad
and
geeky
attendees
but
with
more
people
you
create
the
seed
of
the
web
of
trust
and
the
web
can
expand
from
there
as
everyone
on
your
keyring
goes
out
into
the
world
and
meets
more
people
they
can
add
more
and
more
names
to
the
ring
you
do
have
to
meet
the
new
people
just
trust
that
the
signed
key
you
get
from
the
people
in
your
web
is
valid
so
that
why
web
of
trust
and
parties
go
together
like
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
just
tell
them
it
a
party
invitational
only
i
said
tell
them
not
to
bring
anyone
along
or
they
wo
be
admitted
jolu
looked
at
me
over
his
coffee
you
joking
right
you
tell
people
that
and
they
bring
friends
argh
i
said
i
spent
a
night
a
week
at
jolu
these
days
keeping
the
code
up
to
date
on
indienet
pigspleen
actually
paid
me
a
sum
of
money
to
do
this
which
was
really
weird
i
never
thought
i
be
paid
to
write
code
so
what
do
we
do
we
only
want
people
we
really
trust
there
and
we
do
want
to
mention
why
until
we
got
everyone
keys
and
can
send
them
messages
in
secret
jolu
debugged
and
i
watched
over
his
shoulder
this
used
to
be
called
extreme
programming
which
was
a
little
embarrassing
now
we
just
call
it
programming
two
people
are
much
better
at
spotting
bugs
than
one
as
the
cliche
goes
with
enough
eyeballs
all
bugs
are
shallow
we
were
working
our
way
through
the
bug
reports
and
getting
ready
to
push
out
the
new
rev
it
all
in
the
background
so
our
users
did
really
need
to
do
anything
they
just
woke
up
once
a
week
or
so
with
a
better
program
it
was
pretty
freaky
to
know
that
the
code
i
wrote
would
be
used
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
what
do
we
do
man
i
do
know
i
think
we
just
have
to
live
with
it
i
thought
back
to
our
harajuku
fun
madness
days
there
were
lots
of
social
challenges
involving
large
groups
of
people
as
part
of
that
game
ok
you
right
but
let
at
least
try
to
keep
this
secret
tell
them
that
they
can
bring
a
maximum
of
one
person
and
it
has
to
be
someone
they
known
personally
for
a
minimum
of
five
years
jolu
looked
up
from
the
screen
hey
he
said
hey
that
would
totally
work
i
can
really
see
it
i
mean
if
you
told
me
not
to
bring
anyone
i
be
all
the
hell
does
he
think
he
is
but
when
you
put
it
that
way
it
sounds
like
some
awesome
stuff
i
found
a
bug
we
drank
some
coffee
i
went
home
and
played
a
little
clockwork
plunder
trying
not
to
think
about
with
nosy
questions
and
slept
like
a
baby
sutro
baths
are
san
francisco
authentic
fake
roman
ruins
when
it
opened
in
it
was
the
largest
indoor
bathing
house
in
the
world
a
huge
victorian
glass
solarium
filled
with
pools
and
tubs
and
even
an
early
water
slide
it
went
downhill
by
the
fifties
and
the
owners
torched
it
for
the
insurance
in
all
that
left
is
a
labyrinth
of
weathered
stone
set
into
the
sere
at
ocean
beach
it
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
roman
ruin
crumbled
and
mysterious
and
just
beyond
them
is
a
set
of
caves
that
let
out
into
the
sea
in
rough
tides
the
waves
rush
through
the
caves
and
over
the
ruins
they
even
been
known
to
suck
in
and
drown
the
occasional
tourist
ocean
beach
is
way
out
past
golden
gate
park
a
stark
cliff
lined
with
expensive
doomed
houses
plunging
down
to
a
narrow
beach
studded
with
jellyfish
and
brave
insane
surfers
there
a
giant
white
rock
that
juts
out
of
the
shallows
off
the
shore
that
called
seal
rock
and
it
used
to
be
the
place
where
the
sea
lions
congregated
until
they
were
relocated
to
the
more
environs
of
fisherman
wharf
after
dark
there
hardly
anyone
out
there
it
gets
very
cold
with
a
salt
spray
that
soak
you
to
your
bones
if
you
let
it
the
rocks
are
sharp
and
there
broken
glass
and
the
occasional
junkie
needle
it
is
an
awesome
place
for
a
party
bringing
along
the
tarpaulins
and
chemical
was
my
idea
jolu
figured
out
where
to
get
the
beer
his
older
brother
javier
had
a
buddy
who
actually
operated
a
whole
underage
drinking
service
pay
him
enough
and
he
back
up
to
your
secluded
party
spot
with
and
as
many
brews
as
you
wanted
i
blew
a
bunch
of
my
indienet
programming
money
and
the
guy
showed
up
right
on
time
a
good
hour
after
sunset
and
lugged
the
six
foam
out
of
his
pickup
truck
and
down
into
the
ruins
of
the
baths
he
even
brought
a
spare
chest
for
the
empties
you
kids
play
safe
now
he
said
tipping
his
cowboy
hat
he
was
a
fat
samoan
guy
with
a
huge
smile
and
a
scary
that
you
could
see
his
and
and
escaping
from
i
peeled
twenties
off
my
roll
and
handed
them
to
him
his
markup
was
percent
not
a
bad
racket
he
looked
at
my
roll
you
know
i
could
just
take
that
from
you
he
said
still
smiling
i
a
criminal
after
all
i
put
my
roll
in
my
pocket
and
looked
him
levelly
in
the
eye
i
been
stupid
to
show
him
what
i
was
carrying
but
i
knew
that
there
were
times
when
you
should
just
stand
your
ground
i
just
messing
with
you
he
said
at
last
but
you
be
careful
with
that
money
do
go
showing
it
around
thanks
i
said
homeland
security
get
my
back
though
his
smile
got
even
bigger
ha
they
not
even
real
those
peckerwoods
do
know
nothin
i
looked
over
at
his
truck
prominently
displayed
in
his
windscreen
was
a
fastrak
i
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
until
he
got
busted
you
got
girls
coming
tonight
that
why
you
got
all
the
beer
i
smiled
and
waved
at
him
as
though
he
was
walking
back
to
his
truck
which
he
should
have
been
doing
he
eventually
got
the
hint
and
drove
away
his
smile
never
faltered
jolu
helped
me
hide
the
coolers
in
the
rubble
working
with
little
white
led
torches
on
headbands
once
the
coolers
were
in
place
we
threw
little
white
led
keychains
into
each
one
so
it
would
glow
when
you
took
the
styrofoam
lids
off
making
it
easier
to
see
what
you
were
doing
it
was
a
moonless
night
and
overcast
and
the
distant
streetlights
barely
illuminated
us
i
knew
we
stand
out
like
blazes
on
an
infrared
scope
but
there
was
no
chance
that
we
be
able
to
get
a
bunch
of
people
together
without
being
observed
i
settle
for
being
dismissed
as
a
little
drunken
i
do
really
drink
much
there
been
beer
and
pot
and
ecstasy
at
the
parties
i
been
going
to
since
i
was
but
i
hated
smoking
though
i
quite
partial
to
a
hash
brownie
every
now
and
again
ecstasy
took
too
long
who
got
a
whole
weekend
to
get
high
and
come
down
and
beer
well
it
was
all
right
but
i
did
see
what
the
big
deal
was
my
favorite
was
big
elaborate
cocktails
the
kind
of
thing
served
in
a
ceramic
volcano
with
six
layers
on
fire
and
a
plastic
monkey
on
the
rim
but
that
was
mostly
for
the
theater
of
it
all
i
actually
like
being
drunk
i
just
do
like
being
hungover
and
boy
do
i
ever
get
hungover
though
again
that
might
have
to
do
with
the
kind
of
drinks
that
come
in
a
ceramic
volcano
but
you
ca
throw
a
party
without
putting
a
case
or
two
of
beer
on
ice
it
expected
it
loosens
things
up
people
do
stupid
things
after
too
many
beers
but
it
not
like
my
friends
are
the
kind
of
people
who
have
cars
and
people
do
stupid
things
no
matter
what
beer
or
grass
or
whatever
are
all
incidental
to
that
central
fact
jolu
and
i
each
cracked
beers
anchor
steam
for
him
a
bud
lite
for
me
and
clinked
the
bottles
together
sitting
down
on
a
rock
you
told
them
yeah
he
said
me
too
we
drank
in
silence
the
bud
lite
was
the
least
alcoholic
thing
in
the
i
need
a
clear
head
later
you
ever
get
scared
i
said
finally
he
turned
to
me
no
man
i
do
get
scared
i
always
scared
i
been
scared
since
the
minute
the
explosions
happened
i
so
scared
sometimes
i
do
want
to
get
out
of
bed
then
why
do
you
do
it
he
smiled
about
that
he
said
maybe
i
wo
not
for
much
longer
i
mean
it
been
great
helping
you
great
really
excellent
i
do
know
when
i
done
anything
so
important
but
marcus
bro
i
have
to
say
he
trailed
off
what
i
said
though
i
knew
what
was
coming
next
i
ca
do
it
forever
he
said
at
last
maybe
not
even
for
another
month
i
think
i
through
it
too
much
risk
the
dhs
you
ca
go
to
war
on
them
it
crazy
really
actually
crazy
you
sound
like
van
i
said
my
voice
was
much
more
bitter
than
i
intended
i
not
criticizing
you
man
i
think
it
great
that
you
got
the
bravery
to
do
this
all
the
time
but
i
have
got
it
i
ca
live
my
life
in
perpetual
terror
what
are
you
saying
i
saying
i
out
i
going
to
be
one
of
those
people
who
acts
like
it
all
ok
like
it
all
go
back
to
normal
some
day
i
going
to
use
the
internet
like
i
always
did
and
only
use
the
xnet
to
play
games
i
going
to
get
out
is
what
i
saying
i
wo
be
a
part
of
your
plans
anymore
i
did
say
anything
i
know
that
leaving
you
on
your
own
i
do
want
that
believe
me
i
much
rather
you
give
up
with
me
you
ca
declare
war
on
the
government
of
the
usa
it
not
a
fight
you
going
to
win
watching
you
try
is
like
watching
a
bird
fly
into
a
window
again
and
again
he
wanted
me
to
say
something
what
wanted
to
say
was
jolu
thanks
so
very
much
for
abandoning
me
do
you
forget
what
it
was
like
when
they
took
us
away
do
you
forget
what
the
country
used
to
be
like
before
they
took
it
over
but
that
not
what
he
wanted
me
to
say
what
he
wanted
me
to
say
was
i
understand
jolu
i
respect
your
choice
he
drank
the
rest
of
his
bottle
and
pulled
out
another
one
and
twisted
off
the
cap
there
something
else
he
said
what
i
was
going
to
mention
it
but
i
want
you
to
understand
why
i
have
to
do
this
jesus
jolu
i
hate
to
say
it
but
you
i
not
white
people
get
caught
with
cocaine
and
do
a
little
rehab
time
brown
people
get
caught
with
crack
and
go
to
prison
for
twenty
years
white
people
see
cops
on
the
street
and
feel
safer
brown
people
see
cops
on
the
street
and
wonder
if
they
about
to
get
searched
the
way
the
dhs
is
treating
you
the
law
in
this
country
has
always
been
like
that
for
us
it
was
so
unfair
i
did
ask
to
be
white
i
did
think
i
was
being
braver
just
because
i
white
but
i
knew
what
jolu
was
saying
if
the
cops
stopped
someone
in
the
mission
and
asked
to
see
some
id
chances
were
that
person
was
white
whatever
risk
i
ran
jolu
ran
more
whatever
penalty
i
pay
jolu
would
pay
more
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
said
you
do
have
to
say
anything
he
said
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
so
you
could
understand
i
could
see
people
walking
down
the
side
trail
toward
us
they
were
friends
of
jolu
two
mexican
guys
and
a
girl
i
knew
from
around
short
and
geeky
always
wearing
cute
black
buddy
holly
glasses
that
made
her
look
like
the
outcast
in
a
teen
movie
who
comes
back
as
the
big
success
jolu
introduced
me
and
gave
them
beers
the
girl
did
take
one
but
instead
produced
a
small
silver
flask
of
vodka
from
her
purse
and
offered
me
a
drink
i
took
a
swallow
warm
vodka
must
be
an
acquired
taste
and
complimented
her
on
the
flask
which
was
embossed
with
a
repeating
motif
of
parappa
the
rapper
characters
it
japanese
she
said
as
i
played
another
led
keyring
over
it
they
have
all
these
great
based
on
kids
games
totally
twisted
i
introduced
myself
and
she
introduced
herself
ange
she
said
and
shook
my
hand
with
hers
dry
warm
with
short
nails
jolu
introduced
me
to
his
pals
whom
he
known
since
computer
camp
in
the
fourth
grade
more
people
showed
up
five
then
ten
then
twenty
it
was
a
seriously
big
group
now
we
told
people
to
arrive
by
sharp
and
we
gave
it
until
to
see
who
all
would
show
up
about
three
quarters
were
jolu
friends
i
invited
all
the
people
i
really
trusted
either
i
was
more
discriminating
than
jolu
or
less
popular
now
that
he
told
me
he
was
quitting
it
made
me
think
that
he
was
less
discriminating
i
was
really
pissed
at
him
but
trying
not
to
let
it
show
by
concentrating
on
socializing
with
other
people
but
he
was
stupid
he
knew
what
was
going
on
i
could
see
that
he
was
really
bummed
good
ok
i
said
climbing
up
on
a
ruin
ok
hey
hello
a
few
people
nearby
paid
attention
to
me
but
the
ones
in
the
back
kept
on
chatting
i
put
my
arms
in
the
air
like
a
referee
but
it
was
too
dark
eventually
i
hit
on
the
idea
of
turning
my
led
keychain
on
and
pointing
it
at
each
of
the
talkers
in
turn
then
at
me
gradually
the
crowd
fell
quiet
i
welcomed
them
and
thanked
them
all
for
coming
then
asked
them
to
close
in
so
i
could
explain
why
we
were
there
i
could
tell
they
were
into
the
secrecy
of
it
all
intrigued
and
a
little
warmed
up
by
the
beer
so
here
it
is
you
all
use
the
xnet
it
no
coincidence
that
the
xnet
was
created
right
after
the
dhs
took
over
the
city
the
people
who
did
that
are
an
organization
devoted
to
personal
liberty
who
created
the
network
to
keep
us
safe
from
dhs
spooks
and
enforcers
jolu
and
i
had
worked
this
out
in
advance
we
were
going
to
cop
to
being
behind
it
all
not
to
anyone
it
was
way
too
risky
instead
we
put
it
out
that
we
were
merely
lieutenants
in
army
acting
to
organize
the
local
resistance
the
xnet
is
pure
i
said
it
can
be
used
by
the
other
side
just
as
readily
as
by
us
we
know
that
there
are
dhs
spies
who
use
it
now
they
use
social
engineering
hacks
to
try
to
get
us
to
reveal
ourselves
so
that
they
can
bust
us
if
the
xnet
is
going
to
succeed
we
need
to
figure
out
how
to
keep
them
from
spying
on
us
we
need
a
network
within
the
network
i
paused
and
let
this
sink
in
jolu
had
suggested
that
this
might
be
a
little
heavy
learning
that
you
about
to
be
brought
into
a
revolutionary
cell
now
i
not
here
to
ask
you
to
do
anything
active
you
do
have
to
go
out
jamming
or
anything
you
been
brought
here
because
we
know
you
cool
we
know
you
trustworthy
it
that
trustworthiness
i
want
to
get
you
to
contribute
tonight
some
of
you
will
already
be
familiar
with
the
web
of
trust
and
keysigning
parties
but
for
the
rest
of
you
i
run
it
down
quickly
which
i
did
now
what
i
want
from
you
tonight
is
to
meet
the
people
here
and
figure
out
how
much
you
can
trust
them
we
going
to
help
you
generate
and
share
them
with
each
other
this
part
was
tricky
asking
people
to
bring
their
own
laptops
would
have
worked
out
but
we
still
needed
to
do
something
hella
complicated
that
would
exactly
work
with
paper
and
pencil
i
held
up
a
laptop
jolu
and
i
had
rebuilt
the
night
before
from
the
ground
up
i
trust
this
machine
every
component
in
it
was
laid
by
our
own
hands
it
running
a
fresh
version
of
paranoidlinux
booted
off
of
the
dvd
if
there
a
trustworthy
computer
left
anywhere
in
the
world
this
might
well
be
it
i
got
a
loaded
here
you
come
up
here
and
give
it
some
random
input
mash
the
keys
wiggle
the
mouse
and
it
will
use
that
as
the
seed
to
create
a
random
and
private
key
for
you
which
it
will
display
on
the
screen
you
can
take
a
picture
of
the
private
key
with
your
phone
and
hit
any
key
to
make
it
go
away
forever
it
not
stored
on
the
disk
at
all
then
it
will
show
you
your
public
key
at
that
point
you
call
over
all
the
people
here
you
trust
and
who
trust
you
and
take
a
picture
of
the
screen
with
you
standing
next
to
it
so
they
know
whose
key
it
is
when
you
get
home
you
have
to
convert
the
photos
to
keys
this
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
work
i
afraid
but
you
only
have
to
do
it
once
you
have
to
be
about
typing
these
in
one
mistake
and
you
screwed
luckily
we
got
a
way
to
tell
if
you
got
it
right
beneath
the
key
will
be
a
much
shorter
number
called
the
once
you
typed
in
the
key
you
can
generate
a
fingerprint
from
it
and
compare
it
to
the
fingerprint
and
if
they
match
you
got
it
right
they
all
boggled
at
me
ok
so
i
asked
them
to
do
something
pretty
weird
it
true
but
still
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
the
university
bookstore
at
the
university
of
washington
whose
science
fiction
section
rivals
many
specialty
stores
thanks
to
the
dedicated
science
fiction
buyer
duane
wilkins
duane
a
real
science
fiction
fan
i
first
met
him
at
the
world
science
fiction
convention
in
toronto
in
and
it
shows
in
the
eclectic
and
informed
choices
on
display
at
the
store
one
great
predictor
of
a
great
bookstore
is
the
quality
of
the
shelf
review
the
little
bits
of
cardboard
stuck
to
the
shelves
with
generally
extolling
the
virtues
of
books
you
might
otherwise
miss
the
staff
at
the
university
bookstore
have
clearly
benefited
from
duane
tutelage
as
the
shelf
reviews
at
the
university
bookstore
are
second
to
none

jolu
stood
up
this
is
where
it
starts
guys
this
is
how
we
know
which
side
you
on
you
might
not
be
willing
to
take
to
the
streets
and
get
busted
for
your
beliefs
but
if
you
beliefs
this
will
let
us
know
it
this
will
create
the
web
of
trust
that
tells
us
who
in
and
who
out
if
we
ever
going
to
get
our
country
back
we
need
to
do
this
we
need
to
do
something
like
this
someone
in
the
audience
it
was
ange
had
a
hand
up
holding
a
beer
bottle
so
call
me
stupid
but
i
do
understand
this
at
all
why
do
you
want
us
to
do
this
jolu
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
back
at
him
it
had
all
seemed
so
obvious
when
we
were
organizing
it
the
xnet
is
just
a
way
to
play
free
games
it
the
last
open
communications
network
in
america
it
the
last
way
to
communicate
without
being
snooped
on
by
the
dhs
for
it
to
work
we
need
to
know
that
the
person
we
talking
to
is
a
snoop
that
means
that
we
need
to
know
that
the
people
we
sending
messages
to
are
the
people
we
think
they
are
that
where
you
come
in
you
all
here
because
we
trust
you
i
mean
really
trust
you
trust
you
with
our
lives
some
of
the
people
groaned
it
sounded
melodramatic
and
stupid
i
got
back
to
my
feet
when
the
bombs
went
off
i
said
then
something
welled
up
in
my
chest
something
painful
when
the
bombs
went
off
there
were
four
of
us
caught
up
by
market
street
for
whatever
reason
the
dhs
decided
that
made
us
suspicious
they
put
bags
over
our
heads
put
us
on
a
ship
and
interrogated
us
for
days
they
humiliated
us
played
games
with
our
minds
then
they
let
us
go
all
except
one
person
my
best
friend
he
was
with
us
when
they
picked
us
up
he
been
hurt
and
he
needed
medical
care
he
never
came
out
again
they
say
they
never
saw
him
they
say
that
if
we
ever
tell
anyone
about
this
they
arrest
us
and
make
us
disappear
forever
i
was
shaking
the
shame
the
goddamned
shame
jolu
had
the
light
on
me
oh
christ
i
said
you
people
are
the
first
ones
i
told
if
this
story
gets
around
you
can
bet
they
know
who
leaked
it
you
can
bet
they
come
knocking
on
my
door
i
took
some
more
deep
breaths
that
why
i
volunteered
on
the
xnet
that
why
my
life
from
now
on
is
about
fighting
the
dhs
with
every
breath
every
day
until
we
free
again
any
one
of
you
could
put
me
in
jail
now
if
you
wanted
to
ange
put
her
hand
up
again
we
not
going
to
rat
on
you
she
said
no
way
i
know
pretty
much
everyone
here
and
i
can
promise
you
that
i
do
know
how
to
know
who
to
trust
but
i
know
who
to
trust
old
people
our
parents
grownups
when
they
think
of
someone
being
spied
on
they
think
of
someone
a
bad
guy
when
they
think
of
someone
being
caught
and
sent
to
a
secret
prison
it
someone
someone
brown
someone
young
someone
foreign
they
forget
what
it
like
to
be
our
age
to
be
the
object
of
suspicion
the
how
many
times
have
you
gotten
on
the
bus
and
had
every
person
on
it
give
you
a
look
like
you
been
gargling
turds
and
skinning
puppies
what
worse
they
turning
into
adults
younger
and
younger
out
there
back
in
the
day
they
used
to
say
trust
anyone
over
i
say
trust
any
bastard
over
that
got
a
laugh
and
she
laughed
too
she
was
pretty
in
a
weird
horsey
way
with
a
long
face
and
a
long
jaw
i
not
really
kidding
you
know
i
mean
think
about
it
who
elected
these
who
let
them
invade
our
city
who
voted
to
put
the
cameras
in
our
classrooms
and
follow
us
around
with
creepy
spyware
chips
in
our
transit
passes
and
cars
it
was
a
we
may
be
dumb
we
may
be
young
but
we
not
scum
i
want
that
on
a
i
said
it
would
be
a
good
one
she
said
we
smiled
at
each
other
where
do
i
go
to
get
my
keys
she
said
and
pulled
out
her
phone
we
do
it
over
there
in
the
secluded
spot
by
the
caves
i
take
you
in
there
and
set
you
up
then
you
do
your
thing
and
take
the
machine
around
to
your
friends
to
get
photos
of
your
public
key
so
they
can
sign
it
when
they
get
home
i
raised
my
voice
oh
one
more
thing
jesus
i
ca
believe
i
forgot
this
those
photos
once
you
typed
in
the
the
last
thing
we
want
is
a
flickr
stream
full
of
pictures
of
all
of
us
conspiring
together
there
was
some
nervous
chuckling
then
jolu
turned
out
the
light
and
in
the
sudden
darkness
i
could
see
nothing
gradually
my
eyes
adjusted
and
i
set
off
for
the
cave
someone
was
walking
behind
me
ange
i
turned
and
smiled
at
her
and
she
smiled
back
luminous
teeth
in
the
dark
thanks
for
that
i
said
you
were
great
you
mean
what
you
said
about
the
bag
on
your
head
and
everything
i
meant
it
i
said
it
happened
i
never
told
anyone
but
it
happened
i
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
you
know
with
all
the
time
that
went
by
since
without
saying
anything
it
started
to
feel
like
a
bad
dream
it
was
real
though
i
stopped
and
climbed
up
into
the
cave
i
glad
i
finally
told
people
any
longer
and
i
might
have
started
to
doubt
my
own
sanity
i
set
up
the
laptop
on
a
dry
bit
of
rock
and
booted
it
from
the
dvd
with
her
watching
i
going
to
reboot
it
for
every
person
this
is
a
standard
paranoidlinux
disc
though
i
guess
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
hell
she
said
this
is
all
about
trust
right
yeah
i
said
trust
i
retreated
some
distance
as
she
ran
the
listening
to
her
typing
and
mousing
to
create
randomness
listening
to
the
crash
of
the
surf
listening
to
the
party
noises
from
over
where
the
beer
was
she
stepped
out
of
the
cave
carrying
the
laptop
on
it
in
huge
white
luminous
letters
were
her
public
key
and
her
fingerprint
and
email
address
she
held
the
screen
up
beside
her
face
and
waited
while
i
got
my
phone
out
cheese
she
said
i
snapped
her
pic
and
dropped
the
camera
back
in
my
pocket
she
wandered
off
to
the
revelers
and
let
them
each
get
pics
of
her
and
the
screen
it
was
festive
fun
she
really
had
a
lot
of
charisma
you
did
want
to
laugh
at
her
you
just
wanted
to
laugh
her
and
hell
it
funny
we
were
declaring
a
secret
war
on
the
secret
police
who
the
hell
did
we
think
we
were
so
it
went
through
the
next
hour
or
so
everyone
taking
pictures
and
making
keys
i
got
to
meet
everyone
there
i
knew
a
lot
of
them
some
were
my
invitees
and
the
others
were
friends
of
my
pals
or
my
pals
pals
we
should
all
be
buddies
we
were
by
the
time
the
night
was
out
they
were
all
good
people
once
everyone
was
done
jolu
went
to
make
a
key
and
then
turned
away
giving
me
a
sheepish
grin
i
was
past
my
anger
with
him
though
he
was
doing
what
he
had
to
do
i
knew
that
no
matter
what
he
said
he
always
be
there
for
me
and
we
been
through
the
dhs
jail
together
van
too
no
matter
what
that
would
bind
us
together
forever
i
did
my
key
and
did
the
around
the
gang
letting
everyone
snap
a
pic
then
i
climbed
up
on
the
high
spot
i
spoken
from
earlier
and
called
for
everyone
attention
so
a
lot
of
you
have
noted
that
there
a
vital
flaw
in
this
procedure
what
if
this
laptop
ca
be
trusted
what
if
it
secretly
recording
our
instructions
what
if
it
spying
on
us
what
if
and
i
ca
be
trusted
more
chuckles
a
little
warmer
than
before
more
beery
i
mean
it
i
said
if
we
were
on
the
wrong
side
this
could
get
all
of
us
all
of
into
a
heap
of
trouble
jail
maybe
the
chuckles
turned
more
nervous
so
that
why
i
going
to
do
this
i
said
and
picked
up
a
hammer
i
brought
from
my
dad
toolkit
i
set
the
laptop
down
beside
me
on
the
rock
and
swung
the
hammer
jolu
following
the
swing
with
his
keychain
light
crash
i
always
dreamt
of
killing
a
laptop
with
a
hammer
and
here
i
was
doing
it
it
felt
pornographically
good
and
bad
smash
the
fell
off
shattered
into
millions
of
pieces
exposing
the
keyboard
i
kept
hitting
it
until
the
keyboard
fell
off
exposing
the
motherboard
and
the
crash
i
aimed
square
for
the
hitting
it
with
everything
i
had
it
took
three
blows
before
the
case
split
exposing
the
fragile
media
inside
i
kept
hitting
it
until
there
was
nothing
bigger
than
a
cigarette
lighter
then
i
put
it
all
in
a
garbage
bag
the
crowd
was
cheering
wildly
loud
enough
that
i
actually
got
worried
that
someone
far
above
us
might
hear
over
the
surf
and
call
the
law
all
right
i
called
now
if
you
like
to
accompany
me
i
going
to
march
this
down
to
the
sea
and
soak
it
in
salt
water
for
ten
minutes
i
did
have
any
takers
at
first
but
then
ange
came
forward
and
took
my
arm
in
her
warm
hand
and
said
that
was
beautiful
in
my
ear
and
we
marched
down
to
the
sea
together
it
was
perfectly
dark
by
the
sea
and
treacherous
even
with
our
keychain
lights
slippery
sharp
rocks
that
were
difficult
enough
to
walk
on
even
without
trying
to
balance
six
pounds
of
smashed
electronics
in
a
plastic
bag
i
slipped
once
and
thought
i
was
going
to
cut
myself
up
but
she
caught
me
with
a
surprisingly
strong
grip
and
kept
me
upright
i
was
pulled
in
right
close
to
her
close
enough
to
smell
her
perfume
which
smelled
like
new
cars
i
love
that
smell
thanks
i
managed
looking
into
the
big
eyes
that
were
further
magnified
by
her
mannish
glasses
i
could
tell
what
color
they
were
in
the
dark
but
i
guessed
something
dark
based
on
her
dark
hair
and
olive
complexion
she
looked
mediterranean
maybe
greek
or
spanish
or
italian
i
crouched
down
and
dipped
the
bag
in
the
sea
letting
it
fill
with
salt
water
i
managed
to
slip
a
little
and
soak
my
shoe
and
i
swore
and
she
laughed
we
hardly
said
a
word
since
we
lit
out
for
the
ocean
there
was
something
magical
in
our
wordless
silence
at
that
point
i
had
kissed
a
total
of
three
girls
in
my
life
not
counting
that
moment
when
i
went
back
to
school
and
got
a
hero
welcome
that
not
a
gigantic
number
but
it
not
a
minuscule
one
either
i
have
reasonable
girl
radar
and
i
think
i
could
have
kissed
her
she
was
in
the
traditional
sense
but
there
something
about
a
girl
and
a
night
and
a
beach
plus
she
was
smart
and
passionate
and
committed
but
i
did
kiss
her
or
take
her
hand
instead
we
had
a
moment
that
i
can
only
describe
as
spiritual
the
surf
the
night
the
sea
and
the
rocks
and
our
breathing
the
moment
stretched
i
sighed
this
had
been
quite
a
ride
i
had
a
lot
of
typing
to
do
tonight
putting
all
those
keys
into
my
keychain
signing
them
and
publishing
the
signed
keys
starting
the
web
of
trust
she
sighed
too
let
go
i
said
yeah
she
said
back
we
went
it
was
a
good
night
that
night
jolu
waited
after
for
his
brother
friend
to
come
by
and
pick
up
his
coolers
i
walked
with
everyone
else
up
the
road
to
the
nearest
muni
stop
and
got
on
board
of
course
none
of
us
was
using
an
issued
muni
pass
by
that
point
xnetters
habitually
cloned
someone
else
muni
pass
three
or
four
times
a
day
assuming
a
new
identity
for
every
ride
it
was
hard
to
stay
cool
on
the
bus
we
were
all
a
little
drunk
and
looking
at
our
faces
under
the
bright
bus
lights
was
kind
of
hilarious
we
got
pretty
loud
and
the
driver
used
his
intercom
to
tell
us
to
keep
it
down
twice
then
told
us
to
shut
up
right
now
or
he
call
the
cops
that
set
us
to
giggling
again
and
we
disembarked
in
a
mass
before
he
did
call
the
cops
we
were
in
north
beach
now
and
there
were
lots
of
buses
taxis
the
bart
at
market
street
clubs
and
cafes
to
pull
apart
our
grouping
so
we
drifted
away
i
got
home
and
fired
up
my
xbox
and
started
typing
in
keys
from
my
phone
screen
it
was
dull
hypnotic
work
i
was
a
little
drunk
and
it
lulled
me
into
a
i
was
about
ready
to
nod
off
when
a
new
im
window
popped
up
herro
i
did
recognize
the
handle

wait
what

you

it
all
over
the
place
you
ever
hear
of
the
speedwhores
i
nearly
choked
that
was
trudy
doo
band
as
in
trudy
doo
the
woman
who
had
paid
me
and
jolu
to
update
the
indienet
code
yeah
i
heard
of
them
they
putting
on
a
huge
show
and
they
got
like
fifty
bands
signed
to
play
the
bill
going
to
set
up
on
the
tennis
courts
and
bring
out
their
own
amp
trucks
and
rock
out
all
night
i
felt
like
i
been
living
under
a
rock
how
had
i
missed
that
there
was
an
anarchist
bookstore
on
valencia
that
i
sometimes
passed
on
the
way
to
school
that
had
a
poster
of
an
old
revolutionary
named
emma
goldman
with
the
caption
if
i
ca
dance
i
do
want
to
be
a
part
of
your
revolution
i
been
spending
all
my
energies
on
figuring
out
how
to
use
the
xnet
to
organize
dedicated
fighters
so
they
could
jam
the
dhs
but
this
was
so
much
cooler
a
big
concert
i
had
no
idea
how
to
do
one
of
those
but
i
was
glad
someone
did
and
now
that
i
thought
of
it
i
was
damned
proud
that
they
were
using
the
xnet
to
do
it
the
next
day
i
was
a
zombie
ange
and
i
had
chatted
flirted
until
lucky
for
me
it
was
a
saturday
and
i
was
able
to
sleep
in
but
between
the
hangover
and
the
i
could
barely
put
two
thoughts
together
by
lunchtime
i
managed
to
get
up
and
get
my
ass
out
onto
the
streets
i
staggered
down
toward
the
turk
to
buy
my
coffee
these
days
if
i
was
alone
i
always
bought
my
coffee
there
like
the
turk
and
i
were
part
of
a
secret
club
on
the
way
i
passed
a
lot
of
fresh
graffiti
i
liked
mission
graffiti
a
lot
of
the
times
it
came
in
huge
luscious
murals
or
sarcastic
stencils
i
liked
that
the
mission
taggers
kept
right
on
going
under
the
nose
of
the
dhs
another
kind
of
xnet
i
supposed
they
must
have
all
kinds
of
ways
of
knowing
what
was
going
on
where
to
get
paint
what
cameras
worked
some
of
the
cameras
had
been
over
i
noticed
maybe
they
used
xnet
painted
in
letters
on
the
side
of
an
fence
were
the
drippy
words
do
trust
anyone
over
i
stopped
had
someone
left
my
party
last
night
and
come
here
with
a
can
of
paint
a
lot
of
those
people
lived
in
the
neighborhood
i
got
my
coffee
and
had
a
little
wander
around
town
i
kept
thinking
i
should
be
calling
someone
seeing
if
they
wanted
to
get
a
movie
or
something
that
how
it
used
to
be
on
a
lazy
saturday
like
this
but
who
was
i
going
to
call
van
was
talking
to
me
i
did
think
i
was
ready
to
talk
to
jolu
and
darryl
well
i
could
call
darryl
i
got
my
coffee
and
went
home
and
did
a
little
searching
around
on
the
xnet
blogs
these
anonablogs
were
untraceable
to
any
author
unless
that
author
was
stupid
enough
to
put
her
name
on
it
and
there
were
a
lot
of
them
most
of
them
were
apolitical
but
a
lot
of
them
were
they
talked
about
schools
and
the
unfairness
there
they
talked
about
the
cops
tagging
turned
out
there
been
plans
for
the
concert
in
the
park
for
weeks
it
had
hopped
from
blog
to
blog
turning
into
a
movement
without
my
noticing
and
the
concert
was
called
do
trust
anyone
over
well
that
explained
where
ange
got
it
it
was
a
good
slogan
monday
morning
i
decided
i
wanted
to
check
out
that
anarchist
bookstore
again
see
about
getting
one
of
those
emma
goldman
posters
i
needed
the
reminder
i
detoured
down
to
and
mission
on
my
way
to
school
then
up
to
valencia
and
across
the
store
was
shut
but
i
got
the
hours
off
the
door
and
made
sure
they
still
had
that
poster
up
as
i
walked
down
valencia
i
was
amazed
to
see
how
much
of
the
do
trust
anyone
over
stuff
there
was
half
the
shops
had
do
trust
merch
in
the
windows
lunchboxes
babydoll
tees
trucker
hats
the
hipster
stores
have
been
getting
faster
and
faster
of
course
as
new
memes
sweep
the
net
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
stores
have
gotten
better
at
putting
merch
in
the
windows
to
match
some
funny
little
youtube
of
a
guy
launching
himself
with
made
of
carbonated
water
would
land
in
your
inbox
on
monday
and
by
tuesday
you
be
able
to
buy
with
stills
from
the
video
on
it
but
it
was
amazing
to
see
something
make
the
leap
from
xnet
to
the
head
shops
distressed
designer
jeans
with
the
slogan
written
in
careful
high
school
ink
embroidered
patches
good
news
travels
fast
it
was
written
on
the
when
i
got
to
ms
galvez
social
studies
class
we
all
sat
at
our
desks
smiling
at
it
it
seemed
to
smile
back
there
was
something
profoundly
cheering
about
the
idea
that
we
could
all
trust
each
other
that
the
enemy
could
be
identified
i
knew
it
was
entirely
true
but
it
was
entirely
false
either
ms
galvez
came
in
and
patted
her
hair
and
set
down
her
schoolbook
on
her
desk
and
powered
it
up
she
picked
up
her
chalk
and
turned
around
to
face
the
board
we
all
laughed
but
we
laughed
she
turned
around
and
was
laughing
too
inflation
has
hit
the
nation
it
seems
how
many
of
you
know
where
this
phrase
comes
from
we
looked
at
each
other
hippies
someone
said
and
we
laughed
hippies
are
all
over
san
francisco
both
the
old
stoner
kinds
with
giant
skanky
beards
and
and
the
new
kind
who
are
more
into
and
maybe
playing
than
protesting
anything
well
yes
hippies
but
when
we
think
of
hippies
these
days
we
just
think
of
the
clothes
and
the
music
clothes
and
music
were
incidental
to
the
main
part
of
what
made
that
era
the
sixties
important
you
heard
about
the
civil
rights
movement
to
end
segregation
white
and
black
kids
like
you
riding
buses
into
the
south
to
sign
up
black
voters
and
protest
against
official
state
racism
california
was
one
of
the
main
places
where
the
civil
rights
leaders
came
from
we
always
been
a
little
more
political
than
the
rest
of
the
country
and
this
is
also
a
part
of
the
country
where
black
people
have
been
able
to
get
the
same
union
factory
jobs
as
white
people
so
they
were
a
little
better
off
than
their
cousins
in
the
southland
the
students
at
berkeley
sent
a
steady
stream
of
freedom
riders
south
and
they
recruited
them
from
information
tables
on
campus
at
bancroft
and
telegraph
avenue
you
probably
seen
that
there
are
still
tables
there
to
this
day
well
the
campus
tried
to
shut
them
down
the
president
of
the
university
banned
political
organizing
on
campus
but
the
civil
rights
kids
would
stop
the
police
tried
to
arrest
a
guy
who
was
handing
out
literature
from
one
of
these
tables
and
they
put
him
in
a
van
but
students
surrounded
the
van
and
refused
to
let
it
budge
they
would
let
them
take
this
kid
to
jail
they
stood
on
top
of
the
van
and
gave
speeches
about
the
first
amendment
and
free
speech
that
galvanized
the
free
speech
movement
that
was
the
start
of
the
hippies
but
it
was
also
where
more
radical
student
movements
came
from
black
power
groups
like
the
black
panthers
and
later
gay
rights
groups
like
the
pink
panthers
too
radical
women
groups
even
separatists
who
wanted
to
abolish
men
altogether
and
the
yippies
anyone
ever
hear
of
the
yippies
did
they
levitate
the
pentagon
i
said
i
once
seen
a
documentary
about
this
she
laughed
i
forgot
about
that
but
yes
that
was
them
yippies
were
like
very
political
hippies
but
they
were
serious
the
way
we
think
of
politics
these
days
they
were
very
playful
pranksters
they
threw
money
into
the
new
york
stock
exchange
they
circled
the
pentagon
with
hundreds
of
protestors
and
said
a
magic
spell
that
was
supposed
to
levitate
it
they
invented
a
fictional
kind
of
lsd
that
you
could
spray
onto
people
with
and
shot
each
other
with
it
and
pretended
to
be
stoned
they
were
funny
and
they
made
great
tv
one
yippie
a
clown
called
wavy
gravy
used
to
get
hundreds
of
protestors
to
dress
up
like
santa
claus
so
that
the
cameras
would
show
police
officers
arresting
and
dragging
away
santa
on
the
news
that
night
and
they
mobilized
a
lot
of
people
their
big
moment
was
the
democratic
national
convention
in
where
they
called
for
demonstrations
to
protest
the
vietnam
war
thousands
of
demonstrators
poured
into
chicago
slept
in
the
parks
and
picketed
every
day
they
had
lots
of
bizarre
stunts
that
year
like
running
a
pig
called
pigasus
for
the
presidential
nomination
the
police
and
the
demonstrators
fought
in
the
streets
they
done
that
many
times
before
but
the
chicago
cops
did
have
the
smarts
to
leave
the
reporters
alone
they
beat
up
the
reporters
and
the
reporters
retaliated
by
finally
showing
what
really
went
on
at
these
demonstrations
so
the
whole
country
watched
their
kids
being
really
savagely
beaten
down
by
the
chicago
police
they
called
it
a
riot
the
yippies
loved
to
say
trust
anyone
over
they
meant
that
people
who
were
born
before
a
certain
time
when
america
had
been
fighting
enemies
like
the
nazis
could
never
understand
what
it
meant
to
love
your
country
enough
to
refuse
to
fight
the
vietnamese
they
thought
that
by
the
time
you
hit
your
attitudes
would
be
frozen
and
you
could
ever
understand
why
the
kids
of
the
day
were
taken
to
the
streets
dropping
out
freaking
out
san
francisco
was
ground
zero
for
this
revolutionary
armies
were
founded
here
some
of
them
blew
up
buildings
or
robbed
banks
for
their
cause
a
lot
of
those
kids
grew
up
to
be
more
or
less
normal
while
others
ended
up
in
jail
some
of
the
university
dropouts
did
amazing
things
for
example
steve
jobs
and
steve
wozniak
who
founded
apple
computers
and
invented
the
pc
i
was
really
getting
into
this
i
knew
a
little
of
it
but
i
never
heard
it
told
like
this
or
maybe
it
had
never
mattered
as
much
as
it
did
now
suddenly
those
lame
solemn
street
demonstrations
did
seem
so
lame
after
all
maybe
there
was
room
for
that
kind
of
action
in
the
xnet
movement
i
put
my
hand
up
did
they
win
did
the
yippies
win
she
gave
me
a
long
look
like
she
was
thinking
it
over
no
one
said
a
word
we
all
wanted
to
hear
the
answer
they
did
lose
she
said
they
kind
of
imploded
a
little
some
of
them
went
to
jail
for
drugs
or
other
things
some
of
them
changed
their
tunes
and
became
yuppies
and
went
on
the
lecture
circuit
telling
everyone
how
stupid
they
been
talking
about
how
good
greed
was
and
how
dumb
they
been
but
they
did
change
the
world
the
war
in
vietnam
ended
and
the
kind
of
conformity
and
unquestioning
obedience
that
people
had
called
patriotism
went
out
of
style
in
a
big
way
black
rights
women
rights
and
gay
rights
came
a
long
way
chicano
rights
rights
for
disabled
people
the
whole
tradition
of
civil
liberties
was
created
or
strengthened
by
these
people
today
protest
movement
is
the
direct
descendant
of
those
struggles
i
ca
believe
you
talking
about
them
like
this
charles
said
he
was
leaning
so
far
in
his
seat
he
was
half
standing
and
his
sharp
skinny
face
had
gone
red
he
had
wet
large
eyes
and
big
lips
and
when
he
got
excited
he
looked
a
little
like
a
fish
ms
galvez
stiffened
a
little
then
said
go
on
charles
you
just
described
terrorists
actual
terrorists
they
blew
up
buildings
you
said
they
tried
to
destroy
the
stock
exchange
they
beat
up
cops
and
stopped
cops
from
arresting
people
who
were
breaking
the
law
they
attacked
us
ms
galvez
nodded
slowly
i
could
tell
she
was
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
handle
charles
who
really
seemed
like
he
was
ready
to
pop
charles
raises
a
good
point
the
yippies
were
foreign
agents
they
were
american
citizens
when
you
say
attacked
us
you
need
to
figure
out
who
and
are
when
it
your
fellow
countrymen
crap
he
shouted
he
was
on
his
feet
now
we
were
at
war
then
these
guys
were
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy
it
easy
to
tell
who
us
and
who
them
if
you
support
america
you
us
if
you
support
the
people
who
are
shooting
at
americans
you
does
anyone
else
want
to
comment
on
this
several
hands
shot
up
ms
galvez
called
on
them
some
people
pointed
out
that
the
reason
that
the
vietnamese
were
shooting
at
americans
is
that
the
americans
had
flown
to
vietnam
and
started
running
around
the
jungle
with
guns
others
thought
that
charles
had
a
point
that
people
should
be
allowed
to
do
illegal
things
everyone
had
a
good
debate
except
charles
who
just
shouted
at
people
interrupting
them
when
they
tried
to
get
their
points
out
ms
galvez
tried
to
get
him
to
wait
for
his
turn
a
couple
times
but
he
was
having
any
of
it
i
was
looking
something
up
on
my
schoolbook
something
i
knew
i
read
i
found
it
i
stood
up
ms
galvez
looked
expectantly
at
me
the
other
people
followed
her
gaze
and
went
quiet
even
charles
looked
at
me
after
a
while
his
big
wet
eyes
burning
with
hatred
for
me
i
wanted
to
read
something
i
said
it
short
are
instituted
among
men
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
it
and
to
institute
new
government
laying
its
foundation
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness

anyone
know
what
that
comes
from
a
bunch
of
people
chorused
the
declaration
of
independence
i
nodded
why
did
you
read
that
to
us
marcus
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
founders
of
this
country
said
that
governments
should
only
last
for
so
long
as
we
believe
that
they
working
for
us
and
if
we
stop
believing
in
them
we
should
overthrow
them
that
what
it
says
right
charles
shook
his
head
that
was
hundreds
of
years
ago
he
said
things
are
different
now
what
different
well
for
one
thing
we
do
have
a
king
anymore
they
were
talking
about
a
government
that
existed
because
some
old
jerk
believed
that
god
put
him
in
charge
and
killed
everyone
who
disagreed
with
him
we
have
a
democratically
elected
government
i
did
vote
for
them
i
said
so
that
gives
you
the
right
to
blow
up
a
building
what
who
said
anything
about
blowing
up
a
building
the
yippies
and
hippies
and
all
those
people
believed
that
the
government
no
longer
listened
to
them
look
at
the
way
people
who
tried
to
sign
up
voters
in
the
south
were
treated
they
were
beaten
up
arrested
some
of
them
were
killed
ms
galvez
said
she
held
up
her
hands
and
waited
for
charles
and
me
to
sit
down
we
almost
out
of
time
for
today
but
i
want
to
commend
you
all
on
one
of
the
most
interesting
classes
i
ever
taught
this
has
been
an
excellent
discussion
and
i
learned
much
from
you
all
i
hope
you
learned
from
each
other
too
thank
you
all
for
your
contributions
i
have
an
assignment
for
those
of
you
who
want
a
little
challenge
i
like
you
to
write
up
a
paper
comparing
the
political
response
to
the
and
civil
rights
movements
in
the
bay
area
to
the
present
day
civil
rights
responses
to
the
war
on
terror
three
pages
minimum
but
take
as
long
as
you
like
i
interested
to
see
what
you
come
up
with
the
bell
rang
a
moment
later
and
everyone
filed
out
of
the
class
i
hung
back
and
waited
for
ms
galvez
to
notice
me
yes
marcus
that
was
amazing
i
said
i
never
knew
all
that
stuff
about
the
sixties
the
seventies
too
this
place
has
always
been
an
exciting
place
to
live
in
politically
charged
times
i
really
liked
your
reference
to
the
declaration
that
was
very
clever
thanks
i
said
it
just
came
to
me
i
never
really
appreciated
what
those
words
all
meant
before
today
well
those
are
the
words
every
teacher
loves
to
hear
marcus
she
said
and
shook
my
hand
i
ca
wait
to
read
your
paper
i
bought
the
emma
goldman
poster
on
the
way
home
and
stuck
it
up
over
my
desk
tacked
over
a
vintage
poster
i
also
bought
a
never
trust
that
had
a
photoshop
of
grover
and
elmo
kicking
the
grownups
gordon
and
susan
off
sesame
street
it
made
me
laugh
i
later
found
out
that
there
had
already
been
about
six
photoshop
contests
for
the
slogan
online
in
places
like
fark
and
and
and
there
were
hundreds
of
pics
floating
around
to
go
on
whatever
merch
someone
churned
out
mom
raised
an
eyebrow
at
the
shirt
and
dad
shook
his
head
and
lectured
me
about
not
looking
for
trouble
i
felt
a
little
vindicated
by
his
reaction
ange
found
me
online
again
and
we
until
late
at
night
again
the
white
van
with
the
antennas
came
back
and
i
switched
off
my
xbox
until
it
had
passed
we
all
gotten
used
to
doing
that
ange
was
really
excited
by
this
party
it
looked
like
it
was
going
to
be
monster
there
were
so
many
bands
signed
up
they
were
talking
about
setting
up
a
for
the
secondary
acts
how
they
get
a
permit
to
blast
sound
all
night
in
that
park
there
houses
all
around
there
what
is
tell
me
more
of
your
woah
it
illegal
um
hello
worried
about
breaking
the
law
fair
point
lol
i
felt
a
little
premonition
of
nervousness
though
i
mean
i
was
taking
this
perfectly
awesome
girl
out
on
a
date
that
weekend
well
she
was
taking
me
technically
to
an
illegal
rave
being
held
in
the
middle
of
a
busy
neighborhood
it
was
bound
to
be
interesting
at
least
interesting
people
started
to
drift
into
dolores
park
through
the
long
saturday
afternoon
showing
up
among
the
ultimate
frisbee
players
and
the
some
of
them
played
frisbee
or
walked
dogs
it
was
really
clear
how
the
concert
was
going
to
work
but
there
were
a
lot
of
cops
and
undercovers
hanging
around
you
could
tell
the
undercovers
because
like
zit
and
booger
they
had
castro
haircuts
and
nebraska
physiques
tubby
guys
with
short
hair
and
untidy
mustaches
they
drifted
around
looking
awkward
and
uncomfortable
in
their
giant
shorts
and
shirts
that
hung
down
to
cover
the
chandelier
of
gear
hung
around
their
midriffs
dolores
park
is
pretty
and
sunny
with
palm
trees
tennis
courts
and
lots
of
hills
and
regular
trees
to
run
around
on
or
hang
out
on
homeless
people
sleep
there
at
night
but
that
true
everywhere
in
san
francisco
i
met
ange
down
the
street
at
the
anarchist
bookstore
that
had
been
my
suggestion
in
hindsight
it
was
a
totally
transparent
move
to
seem
cool
and
edgy
to
this
girl
but
at
the
time
i
would
have
sworn
that
i
picked
it
because
it
was
a
convenient
place
to
meet
up
she
was
reading
a
book
called
against
the
wall
when
i
got
there
nice
i
said
you
kiss
your
mother
with
that
mouth
your
mama
do
complain
she
said
actually
it
a
history
of
a
group
of
people
like
the
yippies
but
from
new
york
they
all
used
that
word
as
their
last
names
like
the
idea
was
to
have
a
group
out
there
making
news
but
with
a
totally
unprintable
name
just
to
screw
around
with
the
pretty
funny
really
she
put
the
book
back
on
the
shelf
and
now
i
wondered
if
i
should
hug
her
people
in
california
hug
to
say
hello
and
goodbye
all
the
time
except
when
they
do
and
sometimes
they
kiss
on
the
cheek
it
all
very
confusing
she
settled
it
for
me
by
grabbing
me
in
a
hug
and
tugging
my
head
down
to
her
kissing
me
hard
on
the
cheek
then
blowing
a
fart
on
my
neck
i
laughed
and
pushed
her
away
you
want
a
burrito
i
asked
is
that
a
question
or
a
statement
of
the
obvious
neither
it
an
order
i
bought
some
funny
stickers
that
said
this
phone
is
tapped
which
were
the
right
size
to
put
on
the
receivers
on
the
pay
phones
that
still
lined
the
streets
of
the
mission
it
being
the
kind
of
neighborhood
where
you
got
people
who
could
necessarily
afford
a
cellphone
we
walked
out
into
the
night
air
i
told
ange
about
the
scene
at
the
park
when
i
left
i
bet
they
have
a
hundred
of
those
trucks
parked
around
the
block
she
said
the
better
to
bust
you
with
um
i
looked
around
i
sort
of
hoped
that
you
would
say
something
like
there
no
chance
they
do
anything
about
it
i
do
think
that
really
the
idea
the
idea
is
to
put
a
lot
of
civilians
in
a
position
where
the
cops
have
to
decide
are
we
going
to
treat
these
ordinary
people
like
terrorists
it
a
little
like
the
jamming
but
with
music
instead
of
gadgets
you
jam
right
sometimes
i
forget
that
all
my
friends
do
know
that
marcus
and
are
the
same
person
yeah
a
little
i
said
this
is
like
jamming
with
a
bunch
of
awesome
bands
i
see
mission
burritos
are
an
institution
they
are
cheap
giant
and
delicious
imagine
a
tube
the
size
of
a
bazooka
shell
filled
with
spicy
grilled
meat
guacamole
salsa
tomatoes
refried
beans
rice
onions
and
cilantro
it
has
the
same
relationship
to
taco
bell
that
a
lamborghini
has
to
a
hot
wheels
car
there
are
about
two
hundred
mission
burrito
joints
they
all
heroically
ugly
with
uncomfortable
seats
minimal
decor
faded
mexican
tourist
office
posters
and
electrified
framed
jesus
and
mary
holograms
and
loud
mariachi
music
the
thing
that
distinguishes
them
mostly
is
what
kind
of
exotic
meat
they
fill
their
wares
with
the
really
authentic
places
have
brains
and
tongue
which
i
never
order
but
it
nice
to
know
it
there
the
place
we
went
to
had
both
brains
and
tongue
which
we
did
order
i
got
carne
asada
and
she
got
shredded
chicken
and
we
each
got
a
big
cup
of
horchata
as
soon
as
we
sat
down
she
unrolled
her
burrito
and
took
a
little
bottle
out
of
her
purse
it
was
a
little
aerosol
canister
that
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
unit
she
aimed
it
at
her
burrito
exposed
guts
and
misted
them
with
a
fine
red
oily
spray
i
caught
a
whiff
of
it
and
my
throat
closed
and
my
eyes
watered
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
to
that
poor
defenseless
burrito
she
gave
me
a
wicked
smile
i
a
spicy
food
addict
she
said
this
is
capsaicin
oil
in
a
mister
capsaicin
yeah
the
stuff
in
pepper
spray
this
is
like
pepper
spray
but
slightly
more
dilute
and
way
more
delicious
think
of
it
as
spicy
cajun
visine
if
it
helps
my
eyes
burned
just
thinking
of
it
you
kidding
i
said
you
are
so
not
going
to
eat
that
her
eyebrows
shot
up
that
sounds
like
a
challenge
sonny
you
just
watch
me
she
rolled
the
burrito
up
as
carefully
as
a
stoner
rolling
up
a
joint
tucking
the
ends
in
then
it
in
tinfoil
she
peeled
off
one
end
and
brought
it
up
to
her
mouth
poised
with
it
just
before
her
lips
right
up
to
the
time
she
bit
into
it
i
could
believe
that
she
was
going
to
do
it
i
mean
that
was
basically
an
weapon
she
just
slathered
on
her
dinner
she
bit
into
it
chewed
swallowed
gave
every
impression
of
having
a
delicious
dinner
want
a
bite
she
said
innocently
yeah
i
said
i
like
spicy
food
i
always
order
the
curries
with
four
chilies
next
to
them
on
the
menu
at
the
pakistani
places
i
peeled
back
more
foil
and
took
a
big
bite
big
mistake
you
know
that
feeling
you
get
when
you
take
a
big
bite
of
horseradish
or
wasabi
or
whatever
and
it
feels
like
your
sinuses
are
closing
at
the
same
time
as
your
windpipe
filling
your
head
with
trapped
air
that
tries
to
batter
its
way
out
through
your
watering
eyes
and
nostrils
that
feeling
like
steam
is
about
to
pour
out
of
your
ears
like
a
cartoon
character
this
was
a
lot
worse
this
was
like
putting
your
hand
on
a
hot
stove
only
it
not
your
hand
it
the
entire
inside
of
your
head
and
your
esophagus
all
the
way
down
to
your
stomach
my
entire
body
sprang
out
in
a
sweat
and
i
choked
and
choked
wordlessly
she
passed
me
my
horchata
and
i
managed
to
get
the
straw
into
my
mouth
and
suck
hard
on
it
gulping
down
half
of
it
in
one
go
so
there
a
scale
the
scoville
scale
that
we
use
to
talk
about
how
spicy
a
pepper
is
pure
capsaicin
is
about
million
scovilles
tabasco
is
about
pepper
spray
is
a
healthy
three
million
this
stuff
is
a
puny
about
as
hot
as
a
mild
scotch
bonnet
pepper
i
worked
up
to
it
in
about
a
year
some
of
the
real
hardcore
can
get
up
to
a
million
or
so
twenty
times
hotter
than
tabasco
that
pretty
freaking
hot
at
scoville
temperatures
like
that
your
brain
gets
totally
awash
in
endorphins
it
a
better
than
hash
and
it
good
for
you
i
was
getting
my
sinuses
back
now
able
to
breathe
without
gasping
of
course
you
get
a
ferocious
ring
of
fire
when
you
go
to
the
john
she
said
winking
at
me
yowch
you
are
insane
i
said
fine
talk
from
a
man
whose
hobby
is
building
and
smashing
laptops
she
said
touche
i
said
and
touched
my
forehead
want
some
she
held
out
her
mister
pass
i
said
quickly
enough
that
we
both
laughed
when
we
left
the
restaurant
and
headed
for
dolores
park
she
put
her
arm
around
my
waist
and
i
found
that
she
was
just
the
right
height
for
me
to
put
my
arm
around
her
shoulders
that
was
new
i
never
been
a
tall
guy
and
the
girls
i
dated
had
all
been
my
height
teenaged
girls
grow
faster
than
guys
which
is
a
cruel
trick
of
nature
it
was
nice
it
felt
nice
we
turned
the
corner
on
street
and
walked
up
toward
dolores
before
we
taken
a
single
step
we
could
feel
the
buzz
it
was
like
the
hum
of
a
million
bees
there
were
lots
of
people
streaming
toward
the
park
and
when
i
looked
toward
it
i
saw
that
it
was
about
a
hundred
times
more
crowded
than
it
had
been
when
i
went
to
meet
ange
that
sight
made
my
blood
run
hot
it
was
a
beautiful
cool
night
and
we
were
about
to
party
really
party
party
like
there
was
no
tomorrow
eat
drink
and
be
merry
for
tomorrow
we
die
without
saying
anything
we
both
broke
into
a
trot
there
were
lots
of
cops
with
tense
faces
but
what
the
hell
were
they
going
to
do
there
were
a
of
people
in
the
park
i
not
so
good
at
counting
crowds
the
papers
later
quoted
organizers
as
saying
there
were
people
the
cops
said
maybe
that
means
there
were
whatever
it
was
more
people
than
i
ever
stood
among
as
part
of
an
unscheduled
unsanctioned
event
we
were
among
them
in
an
instant
i
ca
swear
to
it
but
i
do
think
there
was
anyone
over
in
that
press
of
bodies
everyone
was
smiling
some
young
kids
were
there
or
and
that
made
me
feel
better
no
one
would
do
anything
too
stupid
with
kids
that
little
in
the
crowd
no
one
wanted
to
see
little
kids
get
hurt
this
was
just
going
to
be
a
glorious
spring
night
of
celebration
i
figured
the
thing
to
do
was
push
in
towards
the
tennis
courts
we
threaded
our
way
through
the
crowd
and
to
stay
together
we
took
each
other
hands
only
staying
together
did
require
us
to
intertwine
fingers
that
was
strictly
for
pleasure
it
was
very
pleasurable
the
bands
were
all
inside
the
tennis
courts
with
their
guitars
and
mixers
and
keyboards
and
even
a
drum
kit
later
on
xnet
i
found
a
flickr
stream
of
them
smuggling
all
this
stuff
in
piece
by
piece
in
gym
bags
and
under
their
coats
along
with
it
all
were
huge
speakers
the
kind
you
see
in
automotive
supply
places
and
among
them
a
stack
of
car
batteries
i
laughed
genius
that
was
how
they
were
going
to
power
their
stacks
from
where
i
stood
i
could
see
that
they
were
cells
from
a
hybrid
car
a
prius
someone
had
gutted
an
to
power
the
night
entertainment
the
batteries
continued
outside
the
courts
stacked
up
against
the
fence
tethered
to
the
main
stack
by
wires
threaded
through
the
i
counted
batteries
christ
those
things
weighed
a
ton
too
there
no
way
they
organized
this
without
email
and
wikis
and
mailing
lists
and
there
no
way
people
this
smart
would
have
done
that
on
the
public
internet
this
had
all
taken
place
on
the
xnet
i
bet
my
boots
on
it
we
just
kind
of
bounced
around
in
the
crowd
for
a
while
as
the
bands
tuned
up
and
conferred
with
one
another
i
saw
trudy
doo
from
a
distance
in
the
tennis
courts
she
looked
like
she
was
in
a
cage
like
a
pro
wrestler
she
was
wearing
a
torn
and
her
hair
was
in
long
fluorescent
pink
dreads
down
to
her
waist
she
was
wearing
army
camouflage
pants
and
giant
gothy
boots
with
steel
as
i
watched
she
picked
up
a
heavy
motorcycle
jacket
worn
as
a
catcher
mitt
and
put
it
on
like
armor
it
probably
was
armor
i
realized
i
tried
to
wave
to
her
to
impress
ange
i
guess
but
she
did
see
me
and
i
kind
of
looked
like
a
spazz
so
i
stopped
the
energy
in
the
crowd
was
amazing
you
hear
people
talk
about
vibes
and
energy
for
big
groups
of
people
but
until
you
experienced
it
you
probably
think
it
just
a
figure
of
speech
it
not
it
the
smiles
infectious
and
big
as
watermelons
on
every
face
everyone
bopping
a
little
to
an
unheard
rhythm
shoulders
rocking
rolling
walks
jokes
and
laughs
the
tone
of
every
voice
tight
and
excited
like
a
firework
about
to
go
off
and
you
ca
help
but
be
a
part
of
it
because
you
are
by
the
time
the
bands
kicked
off
i
was
utterly
stoned
on
the
opening
act
was
some
kind
of
serbian
which
i
could
figure
out
how
to
dance
to
i
know
how
to
dance
to
exactly
two
kinds
of
music
trance
shuffle
around
and
let
the
music
move
you
and
punk
bash
around
and
mosh
until
you
get
hurt
or
exhausted
or
both
the
next
act
was
oakland
backed
by
a
thrash
metal
band
which
is
better
than
it
sounds
then
some
pop
then
speedwhores
took
the
stage
and
trudy
doo
stepped
up
to
the
mic
my
name
is
trudy
doo
and
you
an
idiot
if
you
trust
me
i
thirty
two
and
it
too
late
for
me
i
lost
i
stuck
in
the
old
way
of
thinking
i
still
take
my
freedom
for
granted
and
let
other
people
take
it
away
from
me
you
the
first
generation
to
grow
up
in
gulag
america
and
you
know
what
your
freedom
is
worth
to
the
last
goddamned
cent
the
crowd
roared
she
was
playing
fast
little
skittery
nervous
chords
on
her
guitar
and
her
bass
player
a
huge
fat
girl
with
a
dykey
haircut
and
even
bigger
boots
and
a
smile
you
could
open
beer
bottles
with
was
laying
it
down
fast
and
hard
already
i
wanted
to
bounce
i
bounced
ange
bounced
with
me
we
were
sweating
freely
in
the
evening
which
reeked
of
perspiration
and
pot
smoke
warm
bodies
crushed
in
on
all
sides
of
us
they
bounced
too
do
trust
anyone
over
she
shouted
we
roared
we
were
one
big
animal
throat
roaring
do
trust
anyone
over
trust
anyone
over
do
trust
anyone
over
trust
anyone
over
do
trust
anyone
over
trust
anyone
over
she
banged
some
hard
chords
on
her
guitar
and
the
other
guitarist
a
little
pixie
of
a
girl
whose
face
bristled
with
piercings
jammed
in
going
up
high
past
the
twelfth
fret
it
our
goddamned
city
it
our
goddamned
country
no
terrorist
can
take
it
from
us
for
so
long
as
we
free
once
we
not
free
the
terrorists
win
take
it
back
take
it
back
you
young
enough
and
stupid
enough
not
to
know
that
you
ca
possibly
win
so
you
the
only
ones
who
can
lead
us
to
victory
it
back
take
it
back
we
roared
she
jammed
down
hard
on
her
guitar
we
roared
the
note
back
and
then
it
got
really
really
loud
i
danced
until
i
was
so
tired
i
could
dance
another
step
ange
danced
alongside
of
me
technically
we
were
rubbing
our
sweaty
bodies
against
each
other
for
several
hours
but
believe
it
or
not
i
totally
was
being
a
about
it
we
were
dancing
lost
in
the
godbeat
and
the
thrash
and
the
screaming
take
it
back
take
it
back
when
i
could
dance
anymore
i
grabbed
her
hand
and
she
squeezed
mine
like
i
was
keeping
her
from
falling
off
a
building
she
dragged
me
toward
the
edge
of
the
crowd
where
it
got
thinner
and
cooler
out
there
on
the
edge
of
dolores
park
we
were
in
the
cool
air
and
the
sweat
on
our
bodies
went
instantly
icy
we
shivered
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
my
waist
warm
me
she
commanded
i
did
need
a
hint
i
hugged
her
back
her
heart
was
an
echo
of
the
fast
beats
from
the
stage
breakbeats
now
fast
and
furious
and
wordless
she
smelled
of
sweat
a
sharp
tang
that
smelled
great
i
knew
i
smelled
of
sweat
too
my
nose
was
pointed
into
the
top
of
her
head
and
her
face
was
right
at
my
collarbone
she
moved
her
hands
to
my
neck
and
tugged
get
down
here
i
did
bring
a
stepladder
is
what
she
said
and
i
tried
to
smile
but
it
hard
to
smile
when
you
kissing
like
i
said
i
kissed
three
girls
in
my
life
two
of
them
had
never
kissed
anyone
before
one
had
been
dating
since
she
was
she
had
issues
none
of
them
kissed
like
ange
she
made
her
whole
mouth
soft
like
the
inside
of
a
ripe
piece
of
fruit
and
she
did
jam
her
tongue
in
my
mouth
but
slid
it
in
there
and
sucked
my
lips
into
her
mouth
at
the
same
time
so
it
was
like
my
mouth
and
hers
were
merging
i
heard
myself
moan
and
i
grabbed
her
and
squeezed
her
harder
slowly
gently
we
lowered
ourselves
to
the
grass
we
lay
on
our
sides
and
clutched
each
other
kissing
and
kissing
the
world
disappeared
so
there
was
only
the
kiss
my
hands
found
her
butt
her
waist
the
edge
of
her
her
warm
tummy
her
soft
navel
they
inched
higher
she
moaned
too
not
here
she
said
let
move
over
there
she
pointed
across
the
street
at
the
big
white
church
that
gives
mission
dolores
park
and
the
mission
its
name
holding
hands
moving
quickly
we
crossed
to
the
church
it
had
big
pillars
in
front
of
it
she
put
my
back
up
against
one
of
them
and
pulled
my
face
down
to
hers
again
my
hands
went
quickly
and
boldly
back
to
her
shirt
i
slipped
them
up
her
front
it
undoes
in
the
back
she
whispered
into
my
mouth
i
had
a
boner
that
could
cut
glass
i
moved
my
hands
around
to
her
back
which
was
strong
and
broad
and
found
the
hook
with
my
fingers
which
were
trembling
i
fumbled
for
a
while
thinking
of
all
those
jokes
about
how
bad
guys
are
at
undoing
bras
i
was
bad
at
it
then
the
hook
sprang
free
she
gasped
into
my
mouth
i
slipped
my
hands
around
feeling
the
wetness
of
her
armpits
which
was
sexy
and
not
at
all
gross
for
some
reason
and
then
brushed
the
sides
of
her
breasts
that
when
the
sirens
started
they
were
louder
than
anything
i
ever
heard
a
sound
like
a
physical
sensation
like
something
blowing
you
off
your
feet
a
sound
as
loud
as
your
ears
could
process
and
then
louder
disperse
immediately
a
voice
said
like
god
rattling
in
my
skull
this
is
an
illegal
gathering
disperse
immediately
the
band
had
stopped
playing
the
noise
of
the
crowd
across
the
street
changed
it
got
scared
angry
i
heard
a
click
as
the
pa
system
of
and
in
the
tennis
courts
powered
up
take
it
back
it
was
a
defiant
yell
like
a
sound
shouted
into
the
surf
or
screamed
off
a
cliff
take
it
back
the
crowd
a
sound
that
made
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
my
neck
stand
up
it
they
chanted
take
it
back
take
it
back
take
it
back
the
police
moved
in
in
lines
carrying
plastic
shields
wearing
darth
vader
helmets
that
covered
their
faces
each
one
had
a
black
truncheon
and
goggles
they
looked
like
soldiers
out
of
some
futuristic
war
movie
they
took
a
step
forward
in
unison
and
every
one
of
them
banged
his
truncheon
on
his
shield
a
cracking
noise
like
the
earth
splitting
another
step
another
crack
they
were
all
around
the
park
and
closing
in
now
disperse
immediately
the
voice
of
god
said
again
there
were
helicopters
overhead
now
no
floodlights
though
the
infrared
goggles
right
of
course
they
have
infrared
scopes
in
the
sky
too
i
pulled
ange
back
against
the
doorway
of
the
church
tucking
us
back
from
the
cops
and
the
choppers
take
it
back
the
pa
roared
it
was
trudy
doo
rebel
yell
and
i
heard
her
guitar
thrash
out
some
chords
then
her
drummer
playing
then
that
big
deep
bass
take
it
back
the
crowd
answered
and
they
boiled
out
of
the
park
at
the
police
lines
i
never
been
in
a
war
but
now
i
think
i
know
what
it
must
be
like
what
it
must
be
like
when
scared
kids
charge
across
a
field
at
an
opposing
force
knowing
what
coming
running
anyway
screaming
hollering
disperse
immediately
the
voice
of
god
said
it
was
coming
from
trucks
parked
all
around
the
park
trucks
that
had
swung
into
place
in
the
last
few
seconds
that
when
the
mist
fell
it
came
out
of
the
choppers
and
we
just
caught
the
edge
of
it
it
made
the
top
of
my
head
feel
like
it
was
going
to
come
off
it
made
my
sinuses
feel
like
they
were
being
punctured
with
it
made
my
eyes
swell
and
water
and
my
throat
close
pepper
spray
not
thousand
scovilles
a
million
and
a
half
they
gassed
the
crowd
i
did
see
what
happened
next
but
i
heard
it
over
the
sound
of
both
me
and
ange
choking
and
holding
each
other
first
the
choking
retching
sounds
the
guitar
and
drums
and
bass
crashed
to
a
halt
then
coughing
then
screaming
the
screaming
went
on
for
a
long
time
when
i
could
see
again
the
cops
had
their
scopes
up
on
their
foreheads
and
the
choppers
were
flooding
dolores
park
with
so
much
light
it
looked
like
daylight
everyone
was
looking
at
the
park
which
was
good
news
because
when
the
lights
went
up
like
that
we
were
totally
visible
what
do
we
do
ange
said
her
voice
was
tight
scared
i
did
trust
myself
to
speak
for
a
moment
i
swallowed
a
few
times
we
walk
away
i
said
that
all
we
can
do
walk
away
like
we
were
just
passing
by
down
to
dolores
and
turn
left
and
up
towards
street
like
we
just
passing
by
like
this
is
none
of
our
business
that
never
work
she
said
it
all
i
got
you
do
think
we
should
try
to
run
for
it
no
i
said
if
we
run
they
chase
us
maybe
if
we
walk
they
figure
we
have
done
anything
and
let
us
alone
they
have
a
lot
of
arrests
to
make
they
be
busy
for
a
long
time
the
park
was
rolling
with
bodies
people
and
adults
clawing
at
their
faces
and
gasping
the
cops
dragged
them
by
the
armpits
then
lashed
their
wrists
with
plastic
cuffs
and
tossed
them
into
the
trucks
like
ok
i
said
ok
she
said
and
that
just
what
we
did
walked
holding
hands
quickly
and
like
two
people
wanting
to
avoid
whatever
trouble
someone
else
was
making
the
kind
of
walk
you
adopt
when
you
want
to
pretend
you
ca
see
a
panhandler
or
do
want
to
get
involved
in
a
it
worked
we
reached
the
corner
and
turned
and
kept
going
neither
of
us
dared
to
speak
for
two
blocks
then
i
let
out
a
gasp
of
air
i
had
know
i
been
holding
in
we
came
to
street
and
turned
down
toward
mission
street
normally
that
a
pretty
scary
neighborhood
at
on
a
saturday
night
that
night
it
was
a
relief
same
old
druggies
and
hookers
and
dealers
and
drunks
no
cops
with
truncheons
no
gas
um
i
said
as
we
breathed
in
the
night
air
coffee
home
she
said
i
think

for
now
coffee
later
yeah
i
agreed
she
lived
up
in
hayes
valley
i
spotted
a
taxi
rolling
by
and
i
hailed
it
that
was
a
small
miracle
there
are
hardly
any
cabs
when
you
need
them
in
san
francisco

you
got

yeah
she
said
the

at
us
through
his
window

opened
the
back
door
so
he
would
take
off
good
night
i
said
she
put
her
hands
behind
my
head
and
pulled
my
face
toward
her
she
kissed
me
hard
on
the
mouth
nothing
sexual
in
it
but
somehow
more
intimate
for
that
good
night
she
whispered
in
my
ear
and
slipped
into
the
taxi
head
swimming
eyes
running
a
burning
shame
for
having
left
all
those
xnetters
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
dhs
and
the
sfpd
i
set

smiling

he
been
given
the
best
present

i
wanted
to
throw
my
schoolbook
on
the
floor
i
made
arrangements
to
meet
ange
at
a
cafe
in
her
neighborhood
after
school
i
jumped
on
the
bart
and
found
myself
sitting
behind
two
guys
in
suits
they
were
looking
at
the
san
francisco
chronicle
which
featured
a
on
the
youth
riot
in
mission
dolores
park
they
were
tutting
and
clucking
over
it
then
one
said
to
the
other
it
like
they
brainwashed
or
something
christ
were
we
ever
that
stupid
i
got
up
and
moved
to
another
seat
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
a
chain
of
gigantic
bookstores
spread
across
the
usa
i
first
encountered
while
staying
at
a
hotel
in
terre
haute
indiana
i
was
giving
a
speech
at
the
rose
hulman
institute
of
technology
later
that
day
the
store
was
next
to
my
hotel
and
i
really
needed
some
reading
material
i
been
on
the
road
for
a
solid
month
and
i
read
everything
in
my
suitcase
and
i
had
another
five
cities
to
go
before
i
headed
home
as
i
stared
intently
at
the
shelves
a
clerk
asked
me
if
i
needed
any
help
now
i
worked
at
bookstores
before
and
a
knowledgeable
clerk
is
worth
her
weight
in
gold
so
i
said
sure
and
started
to
describe
my
tastes
naming
authors
i
enjoyed
the
clerk
smiled
and
said
i
got
just
the
book
for
you
and
proceeded
to
take
down
a
copy
of
my
first
novel
down
and
out
in
the
magic
kingdom
i
busted
out
laughing
introduced
myself
and
had
an
absolutely
lovely
chat
about
science
fiction
that
almost
made
me
late
to
give
my
speech
http
they
total
whores
ange
said
spitting
the
word
out
in
fact
that
an
insult
to
hardworking
whores
everywhere
they
they
we
were
looking
at
a
stack
of
newspapers
we
picked
up
and
brought
to
the
cafe
they
all
contained
reporting
on
the
party
in
dolores
park
and
to
a
one
they
made
it
sound
like
a
drunken
druggy
orgy
of
kids
who
attacked
the
cops
described
the
cost
of
the
riot
and
included
the
cost
of
washing
away
the
residue
from
the
the
rash
of
asthma
attacks
that
clogged
the
city
emergency
rooms
and
the
cost
of
processing
the
eight
hundred
arrested
rioters
no
one
was
telling
our
side
well
the
xnet
got
it
right
anyway
i
said
i
saved
a
bunch
of
the
blogs
and
videos
and
photostreams
to
my
phone
and
i
showed
them
to
her
they
were
accounts
from
people
who
been
gassed
and
beaten
up
the
video
showed
us
all
dancing
having
fun
showed
the
peaceful
political
speeches
and
the
chant
of
take
it
back
and
trudy
doo
talking
about
us
being
the
only
generation
that
could
believe
in
fighting
for
our
freedoms
we
need
to
make
people
know
about
this
she
said
yeah
i
said
glumly
that
a
nice
theory
well
why
do
you
think
the
press
does
ever
publish
our
side
you
said
it
they
whores
yeah
but
whores
do
it
for
the
money
they
could
sell
more
papers
and
commercials
if
they
had
a
controversy
all
they
have
now
is
a
crime
controversy
is
much
bigger
ok
point
taken
so
why
do
they
do
it
well
reporters
can
barely
search
regular
blogs
let
alone
keep
track
of
the
xnet
it
not
as
if
that
a
real
place
to
be
yeah
she
said
well
we
can
fix
that
right
huh
write
it
all
up
put
it
in
one
place
with
all
the
links
a
single
place
where
you
can
go
that
intended
for
the
press
to
find
it
and
get
the
whole
picture
link
it
to
the
howtos
for
xnet
internet
users
can
get
to
the
xnet
provided
they
do
care
about
the
dhs
finding
out
what
they
been
surfing
you
think
it
work
well
even
if
it
does
it
something
positive
to
do
why
would
they
listen
to
us
anyway
who
would
listen
to
i
put
down
my
coffee
i
picked
up
my
phone
and
slipped
it
into
my
pocket
i
stood
up
turned
on
my
heel
and
walked
out
of
the
cafe
i
picked
a
direction
at
random
and
kept
going
my
face
felt
tight
the
blood
gone
into
my
stomach
which
churned
know
who
you
are
i
thought
know
who
is
that
was
it
if
ange
had
figured
it
out
the
dhs
had
too
i
was
doomed
i
had
known
that
since
they
let
me
go
from
the
dhs
truck
that
someday
they
come
and
arrest
me
and
put
me
away
forever
send
me
to
wherever
darryl
had
gone
it
was
all
over
she
nearly
tackled
me
as
i
reached
market
street
she
was
out
of
breath
and
looked
furious
what
the
is
your
problem
mister
i
shook
her
off
and
kept
walking
it
was
all
over
she
grabbed
me
again
stop
it
marcus
you
scaring
me
come
on
talk
to
me
i
stopped
and
looked
at
her
she
blurred
before
my
eyes
i
could
focus
on
anything
i
had
a
mad
desire
to
jump
into
the
path
of
a
muni
trolley
as
it
tore
past
us
down
the
middle
of
the
road
better
to
die
than
to
go
back
marcus
she
did
something
i
only
seen
people
do
in
the
movies
she
slapped
me
a
hard
crack
across
the
face
talk
to
me
dammit
i
looked
at
her
and
put
my
hand
to
my
face
which
was
stinging
hard
no
one
is
supposed
to
know
who
i
am
i
said
i
ca
put
it
any
more
simply
if
you
know
it
all
over
once
other
people
know
it
all
over
oh
god
i
sorry
look
i
only
know
because
well
because
i
blackmailed
jolu
after
the
party
i
stalked
you
a
little
trying
to
figure
out
if
you
were
the
nice
guy
you
seemed
to
be
or
a
secret
i
known
jolu
for
a
long
time
and
when
i
asked
him
about
you
he
gushed
like
you
were
the
second
coming
or
something
but
i
could
hear
that
there
was
something
he
was
telling
me
i
known
jolu
for
a
long
time
he
dated
my
older
sister
at
computer
camp
when
he
was
a
kid
i
have
some
really
good
dirt
on
him
i
told
him
i
go
public
with
it
if
he
did
tell
me
so
he
told
you
no
she
said
he
told
me
to
go
to
hell
then
i
told
him
something
about
me
something
i
never
told
anyone
else
what
she
looked
at
me
looked
around
looked
back
at
me
ok
i
wo
swear
you
to
secrecy
because
what
the
point
either
i
can
trust
you
or
i
ca
last
year
i
she
broke
off
last
year
i
stole
the
standardized
tests
and
published
them
on
the
net
it
was
just
a
lark
i
happened
to
be
walking
past
the
principal
office
and
i
saw
them
in
his
safe
and
the
door
was
hanging
open
i
ducked
into
his
office
there
were
six
sets
of
copies
and
i
just
put
one
into
my
bag
and
took
off
again
when
i
got
home
i
scanned
them
all
and
put
them
up
on
a
pirate
party
server
in
denmark
that
was
i
said
she
blushed
um
yeah
holy
crap
i
said
it
had
been
huge
news
the
board
of
education
said
that
its
no
child
left
behind
tests
had
cost
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
to
produce
and
that
they
have
to
spend
it
all
over
again
now
that
they
had
the
leak
they
called
it
the
news
had
speculated
endlessly
about
the
political
motivations
of
the
leaker
wondering
if
it
was
a
teacher
protest
or
a
student
or
a
thief
or
a
disgruntled
government
contractor
that
was
you
it
was
me
she
said
and
you
told
jolu
this
because
i
wanted
him
to
be
sure
that
i
would
keep
the
secret
if
he
knew
secret
then
he
have
something
he
could
use
to
put
me
in
jail
if
i
opened
my
trap
give
a
little
get
a
little
quid
pro
quo
like
in
silence
of
the
lambs
and
he
told
you
no
she
said
he
did
but
then
i
told
him
how
into
you
i
was
how
i
was
planning
to
totally
make
an
idiot
of
myself
and
throw
myself
at
you
he
told
me
i
could
think
of
anything
to
say
then
i
looked
down
at
my
toes
she
grabbed
my
hands
and
squeezed
them
i
sorry
i
squeezed
it
out
of
him
it
was
your
decision
to
tell
me
if
you
were
going
to
tell
me
at
all
i
had
no
business
no
i
said
now
that
i
knew
how
she
found
out
i
was
starting
to
calm
down
no
it
good
you
know
me
she
said
ol
me
ok
i
can
live
with
this
but
there
one
other
thing
what
there
no
way
to
say
this
without
sounding
like
a
jerk
so
i
just
say
it
people
who
date
each
other
or
whatever
it
is
we
doing
now
they
split
up
when
they
split
up
they
get
angry
at
each
other
sometimes
even
hate
each
other
it
really
cold
to
think
about
that
happening
between
us
but
you
know
we
got
to
think
about
it
i
solemnly
promise
that
there
is
nothing
you
could
ever
do
to
me
that
would
cause
me
to
betray
your
secret
nothing
screw
a
dozen
cheerleaders
in
my
bed
while
my
mother
watches
make
me
listen
to
britney
spears
rip
off
my
laptop
smash
it
with
hammers
and
soak
it
in
i
promise
nothing
ever
i
whooshed
out
some
air
um
i
said
now
would
be
a
good
time
to
kiss
me
she
said
and
turned
her
face
up
next
big
project
on
the
xnet
was
putting
together
the
ultimate
roundup
of
reports
of
the
do
trust
party
at
dolores
park
i
put
together
the
biggest
most
site
i
could
with
sections
showing
the
action
by
location
by
time
by
category
police
violence
dancing
aftermath
singing
i
uploaded
the
whole
concert
it
was
pretty
much
all
i
worked
on
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
the
next
night
and
the
next
my
mailbox
overflowed
with
suggestions
from
people
they
sent
me
dumps
off
their
phones
and
their
then
i
got
an
email
from
a
name
i
recognized
dr
eeevil
three
e
s
one
of
the
prime
maintainers
of
paranoidlinux
i
have
been
watching
your
xnet
experiment
with
great
interest
here
in
germany
we
have
much
experience
with
what
happens
with
a
government
that
gets
out
of
control
one
thing
you
should
know
is
that
every
camera
has
a
unique
noise
signature
that
can
be
used
to
later
connect
a
picture
with
a
camera
that
means
that
the
photos
you
republishing
on
your
site
could
potentially
be
used
to
identify
the
photographers
should
they
later
be
picked
up
for
something
else
luckily
it
not
hard
to
strip
out
the
signatures
if
you
care
to
there
a
utility
on
the
paranoidlinux
distro
you
using
that
does
this
it
called
photonomous
and
you
find
it
in
just
read
the
man
pages
for
documentation
it
simple
though
good
luck
with
what
you
doing
do
get
caught
stay
free
stay
paranoid
dr
eeevil
i
all
the
photos
i
posted
and
put
them
back
up
along
with
a
note
explaining
what
dr
eeevil
had
told
me
warning
everyone
else
to
do
the
same
we
all
had
the
same
basic
paranoidxbox
install
so
we
could
all
anonymize
our
pictures
there
was
anything
i
could
do
about
the
photos
that
had
already
been
downloaded
and
cached
but
from
now
on
we
be
smarter
that
was
all
the
thought
i
gave
the
matter
that
night
until
i
got
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
mom
had
the
radio
on
playing
the
npr
morning
news
arabic
news
agency
is
running
pictures
video
and
accounts
of
last
weekend
youth
riot
in
mission
dolores
park
the
announcer
said
as
i
was
drinking
a
glass
of
orange
juice
i
managed
not
to
spray
it
across
the
room
but
i
choke
a
little
reporters
claim
that
these
accounts
were
published
on
the
a
clandestine
network
used
by
students
and
sympathizers
in
the
bay
area
this
network
existence
has
long
been
rumored
but
today
marks
its
first
mainstream
mention
mom
shook
her
head
just
what
we
need
she
said
as
if
the
police
were
bad
enough
kids
running
around
pretending
to
be
guerrillas
and
giving
them
the
excuse
to
really
crack
down
the
xnet
weblogs
have
carried
hundreds
of
reports
and
multimedia
files
from
young
people
who
attended
the
riot
and
allege
that
they
were
gathered
peacefully
until
the
police
attacked
here
is
one
of
those
accounts
we
were
doing
was
dancing
i
brought
my
little
brother
bands
played
and
we
talked
about
freedom
about
how
we
were
losing
it
to
these
jerks
who
say
they
hate
terrorists
but
who
attack
us
though
we
not
terrorists
we
americans
i
think
they
hate
freedom
not
us
we
danced
and
the
bands
played
and
it
was
all
fun
and
good
and
then
the
cops
started
shouting
at
us
to
disperse
we
all
shouted
take
it
back
meaning
take
america
back
the
cops
gassed
us
with
pepper
spray
my
little
brother
is
twelve
he
missed
three
days
of
school
my
stupid
parents
say
it
was
my
fault
how
about
the
police
we
pay
them
and
they
supposed
to
protect
us
but
they
gassed
us
for
no
good
reason
gassed
us
like
they
gas
enemy
soldiers
similar
accounts
including
audio
and
video
can
be
found
on
website
and
on
the
xnet
you
can
find
directions
for
accessing
this
xnet
on
npr
homepage
dad
came
down
do
you
use
the
xnet
he
said
he
looked
intensely
at
my
face
i
felt
myself
squirm
it
for
i
said
that
what
most
people
use
it
for
it
just
a
wireless
network
it
what
everyone
did
with
those
free
xboxes
they
gave
away
last
year
he
glowered
at
me
games
marcus
you
do
realize
it
but
you
providing
cover
for
people
who
plan
on
attacking
and
destroying
this
country
i
do
want
to
see
you
using
this
xnet
not
anymore
do
i
make
myself
clear
i
wanted
to
argue
hell
i
wanted
to
shake
him
by
the
shoulders
but
i
did
i
looked
away
i
said
sure
dad
i
went
to
school
at
first
i
was
relieved
when
i
discovered
that
they
were
going
to
leave
mr
benson
in
charge
of
my
social
studies
class
but
the
woman
they
found
to
replace
him
was
my
worst
nightmare
she
was
young
just
about
or
and
pretty
in
a
wholesome
kind
of
way
she
was
blonde
and
spoke
with
a
soft
southern
accent
when
she
introduced
herself
to
us
as
mrs
andersen
that
set
off
alarm
bells
right
away
i
did
know
women
under
the
age
of
sixty
that
called
themselves
but
i
was
prepared
to
overlook
it
she
was
young
pretty
she
sounded
nice
she
would
be
she
was
under
what
circumstances
should
the
federal
government
be
prepared
to
suspend
the
bill
of
rights
she
said
turning
to
the
blackboard
and
writing
down
a
row
of
numbers
one
through
ten
never
i
said
not
waiting
to
be
called
on
this
was
easy
constitutional
rights
are
absolute
that
not
a
very
sophisticated
view
she
looked
at
her
marcus
for
example
say
a
policeman
conducts
an
improper
search
he
goes
beyond
the
stuff
specified
in
his
warrant
he
discovers
compelling
evidence
that
a
bad
guy
killed
your
father
it
the
only
evidence
that
exists
should
the
bad
guy
go
free
i
knew
the
answer
to
this
but
i
could
really
explain
it
yes
i
said
finally
but
the
police
should
conduct
improper
searches
wrong
she
said
the
proper
response
to
police
misconduct
is
disciplinary
action
against
the
police
not
punishing
all
of
society
for
one
cop
mistake
she
wrote
criminal
guilt
under
point
one
on
the
board
other
ways
in
which
the
bill
of
rights
can
be
superseded
charles
put
his
hand
up
shouting
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
very
good
she
consulted
the
seating
plan
charles
there
are
many
instances
in
which
the
first
amendment
is
not
absolute
let
list
some
more
of
those
charles
put
his
hand
up
again
endangering
a
law
enforcement
officer
yes
disclosing
the
identity
of
an
undercover
policeman
or
intelligence
officer
very
good
she
wrote
it
down
others
national
security
charles
said
not
waiting
for
her
to
call
on
him
again
libel
obscenity
corruption
of
minors
child
porn
recipes
mrs
andersen
wrote
these
down
fast
but
stopped
at
child
porn
child
porn
is
just
a
form
of
obscenity
i
was
feeling
sick
this
was
not
what
i
learned
or
believed
about
my
country
i
put
my
hand
up
yes
marcus
i
do
get
it
you
making
it
sound
like
the
bill
of
rights
is
optional
it
the
constitution
we
supposed
to
follow
it
absolutely
that
a
common
oversimplification
she
said
giving
me
a
fake
smile
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
it
to
be
a
living
document
that
was
revised
over
time
they
understood
that
the
republic
would
be
able
to
last
forever
if
the
government
of
the
day
could
govern
according
to
the
needs
of
the
day
they
never
intended
the
constitution
to
be
looked
on
like
religious
doctrine
after
all
they
came
here
fleeing
religious
doctrine
i
shook
my
head
what
no
they
were
merchants
and
artisans
who
were
loyal
to
the
king
until
he
instituted
policies
that
were
against
their
interests
and
enforced
them
brutally
the
religious
refugees
were
way
earlier
some
of
the
framers
were
descended
from
religious
refugees
she
said
and
the
bill
of
rights
is
supposed
to
be
something
you
pick
and
choose
from
what
the
framers
hated
was
tyranny
that
what
the
bill
of
rights
is
supposed
to
prevent
they
were
a
revolutionary
army
and
they
wanted
a
set
of
principles
that
everyone
could
agree
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
the
right
of
people
to
throw
off
their
oppressors
yes
yes
she
said
waving
at
me
they
believed
in
the
right
of
people
to
get
rid
of
their
kings
but
charles
was
grinning
and
when
she
said
that
he
smiled
even
wider
they
set
out
the
bill
of
rights
because
they
thought
that
having
absolute
rights
was
better
than
the
risk
that
someone
would
take
them
away
like
the
first
amendment
it
supposed
to
protect
us
by
preventing
the
government
from
creating
two
kinds
of
speech
allowed
speech
and
criminal
speech
they
did
want
to
face
the
risk
that
some
jerk
would
decide
that
the
things
that
he
found
unpleasant
were
illegal
she
turned
and
wrote
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
on
it
we
getting
a
little
ahead
of
the
lesson
but
you
seem
like
an
advanced
group
the
others
laughed
at
this
nervously
the
role
of
government
is
to
secure
for
citizens
the
rights
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
in
that
order
it
like
a
filter
if
the
government
wants
to
do
something
that
makes
us
a
little
unhappy
or
takes
away
some
of
our
liberty
it
ok
providing
they
doing
it
to
save
our
lives
that
why
the
cops
can
lock
you
up
if
they
think
you
a
danger
to
yourself
or
others
you
lose
your
liberty
and
happiness
to
protect
life
if
you
got
life
you
might
get
liberty
and
happiness
later
some
of
the
others
had
their
hands
up
does
that
mean
that
they
can
do
anything
they
want
if
they
say
it
to
stop
someone
from
hurting
us
in
the
future
yeah
another
kid
said
this
sounds
like
you
saying
that
national
security
is
more
important
than
the
constitution
i
was
so
proud
of
my
fellow
students
then
i
said
how
can
you
protect
freedom
by
suspending
the
bill
of
rights
she
shook
her
head
at
us
like
we
were
being
very
stupid
the
founding
fathers
and
spies
they
did
believe
in
absolute
freedom
not
when
it
threatened
the
republic
now
you
take
these
xnet
people
i
tried
hard
not
to
these
jammers
who
were
on
the
news
this
morning
after
this
city
was
attacked
by
people
who
declared
war
on
this
country
they
set
about
sabotaging
the
security
measures
set
up
to
catch
the
bad
guys
and
prevent
them
from
doing
it
again
they
did
this
by
endangering
and
inconveniencing
their
fellow
citizens
they
did
it
to
show
that
our
rights
were
being
taken
away
in
the
name
of
protecting
them
i
said
ok
i
shouted
god
she
had
me
so
steamed
they
did
it
because
the
government
was
treating
like
a
suspected
terrorist
so
they
wanted
to
prove
that
they
should
be
treated
like
terrorists
charles
shouted
back
so
they
acted
like
terrorists
so
they
committed
terrorism
i
boiled
oh
for
christ
sake
committed
terrorism
they
showed
that
universal
surveillance
was
more
dangerous
than
terrorism
look
at
what
happened
in
the
park
last
weekend
those
people
were
dancing
and
listening
to
music
how
is
terrorism
the
teacher
crossed
the
room
and
stood
before
me
looming
over
me
until
i
shut
up
marcus
you
seem
to
think
that
nothing
has
changed
in
this
country
you
need
to
understand
that
the
bombing
of
the
bay
bridge
changed
everything
thousands
of
our
friends
and
relatives
lie
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
this
is
a
time
for
national
unity
in
the
face
of
the
violent
insult
our
country
has
suffered
i
stood
up
i
had
enough
of
this
everything
has
changed
crapola
national
unity
the
whole
point
of
america
is
that
we
the
country
where
dissent
is
welcome
we
a
country
of
dissidents
and
fighters
and
university
dropouts
and
free
speech
people
i
thought
of
ms
galvez
last
lesson
and
the
thousands
of
berkeley
students
who
surrounded
the
when
they
tried
to
arrest
a
guy
for
distributing
civil
rights
literature
no
one
tried
to
stop
those
trucks
when
they
drove
away
with
all
the
people
who
been
dancing
in
the
park
i
did
try
i
was
running
away
maybe
everything
changed
i
believe
you
know
where
mr
benson
office
is
she
said
to
me
you
are
to
present
yourself
to
him
immediately
i
will
have
my
classes
disrupted
by
disrespectful
behavior
for
someone
who
claims
to
love
freedom
of
speech
you
certainly
willing
to
shout
down
anyone
who
disagrees
with
you
i
picked
up
my
schoolbook
and
my
bag
and
stormed
out
the
door
had
a
so
it
was
impossible
to
slam
or
i
would
have
slammed
it
i
went
fast
to
mr
benson
office
cameras
filmed
me
as
i
went
my
gait
was
recorded
the
arphids
in
my
student
id
broadcast
my
identity
to
sensors
in
the
hallway
it
was
like
being
in
jail
close
the
door
marcus
mr
benson
said
he
turned
his
screen
around
so
that
i
could
see
the
video
feed
from
the
social
studies
classroom
he
been
watching
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
that
was
teaching
it
was
she
told
us
that
the
constitution
did
matter
no
she
said
it
was
religious
doctrine
and
you
attacked
her
like
some
kind
of
fundamentalist
proving
her
point
marcus
you
of
all
people
should
understand
that
everything
changed
when
the
bridge
was
bombed
your
friend
darryl
do
you
say
a
goddamned
word
about
him
i
said
the
anger
bubbling
over
you
not
fit
to
talk
about
him
yeah
i
understand
that
everything
different
now
we
used
to
be
a
free
country
now
we
not
marcus
do
you
know
what
means
i
backed
down
he
could
expel
me
for
threatening
behavior
it
was
supposed
to
be
used
against
gang
kids
who
tried
to
intimidate
their
teachers
but
of
course
he
would
have
any
compunctions
about
using
it
on
me
yes
i
said
i
know
what
it
means
i
think
you
owe
me
an
apology
he
said
i
looked
at
him
he
was
barely
suppressing
his
sadistic
smile
a
part
of
me
wanted
to
grovel
it
wanted
to
beg
for
his
forgiveness
for
all
my
shame
i
tamped
that
part
down
and
decided
that
i
would
rather
get
kicked
out
than
apologize
governments
are
instituted
among
men
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the

that
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter

it

to
institute
new

laying

on
such
principles
and
organizing
its

in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
i
remembered
it
word
for
word
he
shook
his
head
remembering
things
is
the
same
as
understanding
them
sonny
he
bent
over
his
computer
and
made
some
clicks
his
printer
purred

handed
me

sheet
of
warm
board

that

http

san

ca

the
xnet
was
much
fun
in
the
middle
of
the
when
all
the
people
who
used
it
were
in
school
i
had
the
piece
of
paper
folded
in
the
back
pocket
of
my
jeans
and
i
threw
it
on
the
kitchen
table
when
i
got
home
i
sat
down
in
the
living
room
and
switched
on
the
tv
i
never
watched
it
but
i
knew
that
my
parents
did
the
tv
and
the
radio
and
the
newspapers
were
where
they
got
all
their
ideas
about
the
world
the
news
was
terrible
there
were
so
many
reasons
to
be
scared
american
soldiers
were
dying
all
over
the
world
not
just
soldiers
either
national
guardsmen
who
thought
they
were
signing
up
to
help
rescue
people
from
hurricanes
stationed
overseas
for
years
and
years
of
a
long
and
endless
war
i
flipped
around
the
news
networks
one
after
another
a
parade
of
officials
telling
us
why
we
should
be
scared
a
parade
of
photos
of
bombs
going
off
around
the
world
i
kept
flipping
and
found
myself
looking
at
a
familiar
face
it
was
the
guy
who
had
come
into
the
truck
and
spoken
to
woman
when
i
was
chained
up
in
the
back
wearing
a
military
uniform
the
caption
identified
him
as
major
general
graeme
sutherland
regional
commander
dhs
i
hold
in
my
hands
actual
literature
on
offer
at
the
concert
in
dolores
park
last
weekend
he
held
up
a
stack
of
pamphlets
there
been
lots
of
pamphleteers
there
i
remembered
wherever
you
got
a
group
of
people
in
san
francisco
you
got
pamphlets
i
want
you
to
look
at
these
for
a
moment
let
me
read
you
their
titles
without
the
consent
of
the
governed
a
citizen
guide
to
overthrowing
the
state
here
one
did
the
september
bombings
really
happen
and
another
how
to
use
their
security
against
them
this
literature
shows
us
the
true
purpose
of
the
illegal
gathering
on
saturday
night
this
was
merely
an
unsafe
gathering
of
thousands
of
people
without
proper
precaution
or
even
toilets
it
was
a
recruiting
rally
for
the
enemy
it
was
an
attempt
to
corrupt
children
into
embracing
the
idea
that
america
should
protect
herself
take
this
slogan
do
trust
anyone
over
what
better
way
to
ensure
that
no
considered
balanced
adult
discussion
is
ever
injected
into
your
message
than
to
exclude
adults
limiting
your
group
to
impressionable
young
people
when
police
came
on
the
scene
they
found
a
recruitment
rally
for
america
enemies
in
progress
the
gathering
had
already
disrupted
the
nights
of
hundreds
of
residents
in
the
area
none
of
whom
had
been
consulted
in
the
planning
of
this
all
night
rave
party
they
ordered
these
people
to
disperse
that
much
is
visible
on
all
the
video
and
when
the
revelers
turned
to
attack
them
egged
on
by
the
musicians
on
stage
the
police
subdued
them
using
crowd
control
techniques
the
arrestees
were
and
provocateurs
who
had
led
the
thousands
of
impressionistic
young
people
there
to
charge
the
police
lines
of
them
were
taken
into
custody
many
of
these
people
had
prior
offenses
more
than
of
them
had
outstanding
warrants
they
are
still
in
custody
ladies
and
gentlemen
america
is
fighting
a
war
on
many
fronts
but
nowhere
is
she
in
more
grave
danger
than
she
is
here
at
home
whether
we
are
being
attacked
by
terrorists
or
those
who
sympathize
with
them
a
reporter
held
up
a
hand
and
said
general
sutherland
surely
you
not
saying
that
these
children
were
terrorist
sympathizers
for
attending
a
party
in
a
park
of
course
not
but
when
young
people
are
brought
under
the
influence
of
our
country
enemies
it
easy
for
them
to
end
up
over
their
heads
terrorists
would
love
to
recruit
a
fifth
column
to
fight
the
war
on
the
home
front
for
them
if
these
were
my
children
i
be
gravely
concerned
another
reporter
chimed
in
surely
this
is
just
an
open
air
concert
general
they
were
hardly
drilling
with
rifles
the
general
produced
a
stack
of
photos
and
began
to
hold
them
up
these
are
pictures
that
officers
took
with
cameras
before
moving
in
he
held
them
next
to
his
face
and
paged
through
them
one
at
a
time
they
showed
people
dancing
really
rough
some
people
getting
crushed
or
stepped
on
then
they
moved
into
sex
stuff
by
the
trees
a
girl
with
three
guys
two
guys
necking
together
there
were
children
as
young
as
ten
years
old
at
this
event
a
deadly
cocktail
of
drugs
propaganda
and
music
resulted
in
dozens
of
injuries
it
a
wonder
there
were
any
deaths
i
switched
the
tv
off
they
made
it
look
like
it
had
been
a
riot
if
my
parents
thought
i
been
there
they
have
strapped
me
to
my
bed
for
a
month
and
only
let
me
out
afterward
wearing
a
tracking
collar
speaking
of
which
they
were
going
to
be
when
they
found
out
i
been
suspended
they
did
take
it
well
dad
wanted
to
ground
me
but
mom
and
i
talked
him
out
of
it
you
know
that
has
had
it
in
for
marcus
for
years
mom
said
the
last
time
we
met
him
you
cursed
him
for
an
hour
afterward
i
think
the
word
was
mentioned
repeatedly
dad
shook
his
head
disrupting
a
class
to
argue
against
the
department
of
homeland
security
it
a
social
studies
class
dad
i
said
i
was
beyond
caring
anymore
but
i
felt
like
if
mom
was
going
to
stick
up
for
me
i
should
help
her
out
we
were
talking
about
the
dhs
is
debate
supposed
to
be
healthy
look
son
he
said
he
taking
to
calling
me
son
a
lot
it
made
me
feel
like
he
stopped
thinking
of
me
as
a
person
and
switched
to
thinking
of
me
as
a
kind
of
larva
that
needed
to
be
guided
out
of
adolescence
i
hated
it
you
going
to
have
to
learn
to
live
with
the
fact
that
we
live
in
a
different
world
today
you
have
every
right
to
speak
your
mind
of
course
but
you
have
to
be
prepared
for
the
consequences
of
doing
so
you
have
to
face
the
fact
that
there
are
people
who
are
hurting
who
are
going
to
want
to
argue
the
finer
points
of
constitutional
law
when
their
lives
are
at
stake
we
in
a
lifeboat
now
and
once
you
in
the
lifeboat
no
one
wants
to
hear
about
how
mean
the
captain
is
being
i
barely
restrained
myself
from
rolling
my
eyes
i
been
assigned
two
weeks
of
independent
study
writing
one
paper
for
each
of
my
subjects
using
the
city
for
my
background
a
history
paper
a
social
studies
paper
an
english
paper
a
physics
paper
it
beats
sitting
around
at
home
watching
television
dad
looked
hard
at
me
like
he
suspected
i
was
up
to
something
then
nodded
i
said
goodnight
to
them
and
went
up
to
my
room
i
fired
up
my
xbox
and
opened
a
and
started
to
brainstorm
ideas
for
my
papers
why
not
it
really
was
better
than
sitting
around
at
home
i
ended
up
iming
with
ange
for
quite
a
while
that
night
she
was
sympathetic
about
everything
and
told
me
she
help
me
with
my
papers
if
i
wanted
to
meet
her
after
school
the
next
night
i
knew
where
her
school
was
she
went
to
the
same
school
as
van
and
it
was
all
the
way
over
in
the
east
bay
where
i
had
visited
since
the
bombs
went
i
was
really
excited
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
again
every
night
since
the
party
i
gone
to
bed
thinking
of
two
things
the
sight
of
the
crowd
charging
the
police
lines
and
the
feeling
of
the
side
of
her
breast
under
her
shirt
as
we
leaned
against
the
pillar
she
was
amazing
i
never
been
with
a
girl
as
aggressive
as
her
before
it
had
always
been
me
putting
the
moves
on
and
them
pushing
me
away
i
got
the
feeling
that
ange
was
as
much
of
a
as
i
was
it
was
a
tantalizing
notion
i
slept
soundly
that
night
with
exciting
dreams
of
me
and
ange
and
what
we
might
do
if
we
found
ourselves
in
a
secluded
spot
somewhere
the
next
day
i
set
out
to
work
on
my
papers
san
francisco
is
a
good
place
to
write
about
history
sure
it
there
from
the
gold
rush
to
the
wwii
shipyards
the
japanese
internment
camps
the
invention
of
the
pc
physics
the
exploratorium
has
the
coolest
exhibits
of
any
museum
i
ever
been
to
i
took
a
perverse
satisfaction
in
the
exhibits
on
soil
liquefaction
during
big
quakes
english
jack
london
beat
poets
science
fiction
writers
like
pat
murphy
and

social

the
free

cesar
chavez
gay
rights
feminism
movement
i
always
loved
just
learning
stuff
for
its
own
sake
just
to
be
smarter
about
the
world
around
me
i
could
do
that
just
by
walking
around
the
city
i
decided
i
do
an
english
paper
about
the
beats
first
city
lights
books
had
a
great
library
in
an
upstairs
room
where
alan
ginsberg
and
his
buddies
had
created
their
radical
druggy
poetry
the
one
we
read
in
english
class
was
and
i
would
never
forget
the
opening
lines
they
gave
me
shivers
down
my
back
i
saw
the
best
minds
of
my
generation
destroyed
by
madness
starving
hysterical
naked
dragging
themselves
through
the
negro
streets
at
dawn
looking
for
an
angry
fix
angelheaded
hipsters
burning
for
the
ancient
heavenly
connection
to
the
starry
dynamo
in
the
machinery
of
night
i
liked
the
way
he
ran
those
words
all
together
starving
hysterical
naked
i
knew
how
that
felt
and
best
minds
of
my
generation
made
me
think
hard
too
it
made
me
remember
the
park
and
the
police
and
the
gas
falling
they
busted
ginsberg
for
obscenity
over
howl
all
about
a
line
about
gay
sex
that
would
hardly
have
caused
us
to
blink
an
eye
today
it
made
me
happy
somehow
knowing
that
we
made
some
progress
that
things
had
been
even
more
restrictive
than
this
before
i
lost
myself
in
the
library
reading
these
beautiful
old
editions
of
the
books
i
got
lost
in
jack
kerouac
the
a
novel
i
been
meaning
to
read
for
a
long
time
and
a
clerk
who
came
up
to
check
on
me
nodded
approvingly
and
found
me
a
cheap
edition
that
he
sold
me
for
six
bucks
i
walked
into
chinatown
and
had
dim
sum
buns
and
noodles
with
that
i
had
previously
considered
to
be
pretty
hot
but
which
would
never
seem
anything
like
hot
ever
again
not
now
that
i
had
an
ange
special
as
the
day
wore
on
toward
the
afternoon
i
got
on
the
bart
and
switched
to
a
san
mateo
bridge
shuttle
bus
to
bring
me
around
to
the
east
bay
i
read
my
copy
of
the
and
dug
the
scenery
whizzing
past
the
is
a
novel
about
jack
kerouac
a
druggy
writer
who
goes
hitchhiking
around
america
working
crummy
jobs
howling
through
the
streets
at
night
meeting
people
and
parting
ways
hipsters
hobos
muggers
scumbags
and
angels
there
not
really
a
plot
kerouac
supposedly
wrote
it
in
three
weeks
on
a
long
roll
of
paper
stoned
out
of
his
mind
only
a
bunch
of
amazing
things
one
thing
happening
after
another
he
makes
friends
with
people
like
dean
moriarty
who
get
him
involved
in
weird
schemes
that
never
really
work
out
but
still
it
works
out
if
you
know
what
i
mean
there
was
a
rhythm
to
the
words
it
was
luscious
i
could
hear
it
being
read
aloud
in
my
head
it
made
me
want
to
lie
down
in
the
bed
of
a
pickup
truck
and
wake
up
in
a
dusty
little
town
somewhere
in
the
central
valley
on
the
way
to
la
one
of
those
places
with
a
gas
station
and
a
diner
and
just
walk
out
into
the
fields
and
meet
people
and
see
stuff
and
do
stuff
it
was
a
long
bus
ride
and
i
must
have
dozed
off
a
little
staying
up
late
iming
with
ange
was
hard
on
my
since
mom
still
expected
me
down
for
breakfast
i
woke
up
and
changed
buses
and
before
long
i
was
at
ange
school
she
came
bounding
out
of
the
gates
in
her
uniform
i
never
seen
her
in
it
before
it
was
kind
of
cute
in
a
weird
way
and
reminded
me
of
van
in
her
uniform
she
gave
me
a
long
hug
and
a
hard
kiss
on
the
cheek
hello
you
she
said
hiya
whatcha
reading
i
been
waiting
for
this
i
marked
the
passage
with
a
finger
listen
danced
down
the
streets
like
dingledodies
and
i
shambled
after
as
i
been
doing
all
my
life
after
people
who
interest
me
because
the
only
people
for
me
are
the
mad
ones
the
ones
who
are
mad
to
live
mad
to
talk
mad
to
be
saved
desirous
of
everything
at
the
same
time
the
ones
that
never
yawn
or
say
a
commonplace
thing
but
burn
burn
burn
like
fabulous
yellow
roman
candles
exploding
like
spiders
across
the
stars
and
in
the
middle
you
see
the
blue
centerlight
pop
and
everybody
goes
awww
she
took
the
book
and
read
the
passage
again
for
herself
wow
dingledodies
i
love
it
is
it
all
like
this
i
told
her
about
the
parts
i
read
walking
slowly
down
the
sidewalk
back
toward
the
once
we
turned
the
corner
she
put
her
arm
around
my
waist
and
i
slung
mine
around
her
shoulder
walking
down
the
street
with
a
girl
my
girlfriend
sure
why
not
talking
about
this
cool
book
it
was
heaven
made
me
forget
my
troubles
for
a
little
while
marcus
i
turned
around
it
was
van
in
my
subconscious
i
expected
this
i
knew
because
my
conscious
mind
was
remotely
surprised
it
was
a
big
school
and
they
all
got
out
at
the
same
time
i
had
spoken
to
van
in
weeks
and
those
weeks
felt
like
months
we
used
to
talk
every
day
hey
van
i
said
i
suppressed
the
urge
to
take
my
arm
off
of
ange
shoulders
van
seemed
surprised
but
not
angry
more
ashen
shaken
she
looked
closely
at
the
two
of
us
angela
hey
vanessa
ange
said
what
are
you
doing
here
i
came
out
to
get
ange
i
said
trying
to
keep
my
tone
neutral
i
was
suddenly
embarrassed
to
be
seen
with
another
girl
oh
van
said
well
it
was
nice
to
see
you
nice
to
see
you
too
vanessa
ange
said
swinging
me
around
marching
me
back
toward
the
you
know
her
ange
said
yeah
since
forever
was
she
your
girlfriend
what
no
no
way
we
were
just
friends
you
friends
i
felt
like
van
was
walking
right
behind
us
listening
in
though
at
the
pace
we
were
walking
she
would
have
to
be
jogging
to
keep
up
i
resisted
the
temptation
to
look
over
my
shoulder
for
as
long
as
possible
then
i
did
there
were
lots
of
girls
from
the
school
behind
us
but
no
van
she
was
with
me
and
and
darryl
when
we
were
arrested
we
used
to
arg
together
the
four
of
us
we
were
kind
of
best
friends
and
what
happened
i
dropped
my
voice
she
did
like
the
xnet
i
said
she
thought
we
would
get
into
trouble
that
i
get
other
people
into
trouble
and
that
why
you
stopped
being
friends
we
just
drifted
apart
we
walked
a
few
steps
you
were
you
know
friends
no
i
said
my
face
was
hot
i
felt
like
i
sounded
like
i
was
lying
even
though
i
was
telling
the
truth
ange
jerked
us
to
a
halt
and
studied
my
face
were
you
no
seriously
just
friends
darryl
and
her
well
not
quite
but
darryl
was
so
into
her
there
was
no
way
but
if
darryl
had
been
into
her
you
would
have
huh
no
ange
no
please
just
believe
me
and
let
it
go
vanessa
was
a
good
friend
and
we
not
anymore
and
that
upsets
me
but
i
was
never
into
her
that
way
all
right
she
slumped
a
little
ok
ok
i
sorry
i
do
really
get
along
with
her
is
all
we
never
gotten
along
in
all
the
years
we
known
each
other
oh
ho
i
thought
this
would
be
how
it
came
to
be
that
jolu
knew
her
for
so
long
and
i
never
met
her
she
had
some
kind
of
thing
with
van
and
he
did
want
to
bring
her
around
she
gave
me
a
long
hug
and
we
kissed
and
a
bunch
of
girls
passed
us
going
and
we
straightened
up
and
headed
for
the
ahead
of
us
walked
van
who
must
have
gone
past
while
we
were
kissing
i
felt
like
a
complete
jerk
of
course
she
was
at
the
stop
and
on
the
bus
and
we
did
say
a
word
to
each
other
and
i
tried
to
make
conversation
with
ange
all
the
way
but
it
was
awkward
the
plan
was
to
stop
for
a
coffee
and
head
to
ange
place
to
hang
out
and
study
take
turns
on
her
xbox
looking
at
the
xnet
ange
mom
got
home
late
on
tuesdays
which
was
her
night
for
yoga
class
and
dinner
with
her
girls
and
ange
sister
was
going
out
with
her
boyfriend
so
we
have
the
place
to
ourselves
i
been
having
pervy
thoughts
about
it
ever
since
we
made
the
plan
we
got
to
her
place
and
went
straight
to
her
room
and
shut
the
door
her
room
was
kind
of
a
disaster
covered
with
layers
of
clothes
and
notebooks
and
parts
of
pcs
that
would
dig
into
your
stocking
feet
like
caltrops
her
desk
was
worse
than
the
floor
piled
high
with
books
and
comics
so
we
ended
up
sitting
on
her
bed
which
was
ok
by
me
the
awkwardness
from
seeing
van
had
gone
away
somewhat
and
we
got
her
xbox
up
and
running
it
was
in
the
center
of
a
nest
of
wires
some
going
to
a
wireless
antenna
she
hacked
into
it
and
stuck
to
the
window
so
she
could
tune
in
the
neighbors
wifi
some
went
to
a
couple
of
old
laptop
screens
she
turned
into
standalone
monitors
balanced
on
stands
and
bristling
with
exposed
electronics
the
screens
were
on
both
bedside
tables
which
was
an
excellent
setup
for
watching
movies
or
iming
from
bed
she
could
turn
the
monitors
sidewise
and
lie
on
her
side
and
they
be
no
matter
which
side
she
lay
on
we
both
knew
what
we
were
really
there
for
sitting
side
by
side
propped
against
the
bedside
table
i
was
trembling
a
little
and
of
the
warmth
of
her
leg
and
shoulder
against
mine
but
i
needed
to
go
through
the
motions
of
logging
into
xnet
and
seeing
what
email
i
gotten
and
so
on
there
was
an
email
from
a
kid
who
liked
to
send
in
funny
videos
of
the
dhs
being
really
crazy
the
last
one
had
been
of
them
disassembling
a
baby
stroller
after
a
dog
had
shown
an
interest
in
it
taking
it
apart
with
screwdrivers
right
on
the
street
in
the
marina
while
all
these
rich
people
walked
past
staring
at
them
and
marveling
at
how
weird
it
was
i
linked
to
the
video
and
it
had
been
downloaded
like
crazy
he
hosted
it
on
the
internet
archive
alexandria
mirror
in
egypt
where
they
host
anything
for
free
so
long
as
you
put
it
under
the
creative
commons
license
which
let
anyone
remix
it
and
share
it
the
us
archive
which
was
down
in
the
presidio
only
a
few
minutes
away
had
been
forced
to
take
down
all
those
videos
in
the
name
of
national
security
but
the
alexandria
archive
had
split
away
into
its
own
organization
and
was
hosting
anything
that
embarrassed
the
usa
this
kid
his
handle
was
kameraspie
had
sent
me
an
even
better
video
this
time
around
it
was
at
the
doorway
to
city
hall
in
civic
center
a
huge
wedding
cake
of
a
building
covered
with
statues
in
little
archways
and
gilt
leaves
and
trim
the
dhs
had
a
secure
perimeter
around
the
building
and
kameraspie
video
showed
a
great
shot
of
their
checkpoint
as
a
guy
in
an
officer
uniform
approached
and
showed
his
id
and
put
his
briefcase
on
the
belt
it
was
all
ok
until
one
of
the
dhs
people
saw
something
he
did
like
on
the
he
questioned
the
general
who
rolled
his
eyes
and
said
something
inaudible
the
video
had
been
shot
from
across
the
street
apparently
with
a
homemade
concealed
zoom
lens
so
the
audio
was
mostly
of
people
walking
past
and
traffic
noises
the
general
and
the
dhs
guys
got
into
an
argument
and
the
longer
they
argued
the
more
dhs
guys
gathered
around
them
finally
the
general
shook
his
head
angrily
and
waved
his
finger
at
the
dhs
guy
chest
and
picked
up
his
briefcase
and
started
to
walk
away
the
dhs
guys
shouted
at
him
but
he
did
slow
his
body
language
really
said
i
am
totally
utterly
pissed
then
it
happened
the
dhs
guys
ran
after
the
general
kameraspie
slowed
the
video
down
here
so
we
could
see
in
the
general
his
face
all
like
no
freaking
way
are
you
about
to
tackle
me
then
changing
to
horror
as
three
of
the
giant
dhs
guards
slammed
into
him
knocking
him
sideways
then
catching
him
at
the
middle
like
a
football
tackle
the
general
middle
aged
steely
grey
hair
lined
and
dignified
face
went
down
like
a
sack
of
potatoes
and
bounced
twice
his
face
slamming
off
the
sidewalk
and
blood
starting
out
of
his
nose
the
dhs
the
general
strapping
him
at
ankles
and
wrists
the
general
was
shouting
now
really
shouting
his
face
purpling
under
the
blood
streaming
from
his
nose
legs
swished
by
in
the
tight
zoom
passing
pedestrians
looked
at
this
guy
in
his
uniform
getting
tied
up
and
you
could
see
from
his
face
that
this
was
the
worst
part
this
was
the
ritual
humiliation
the
removal
of
dignity
the
clip
ended
oh
my
dear
sweet
buddha
i
said
looking
at
the
screen
as
it
faded
to
black
starting
the
video
again
i
nudged
ange
and
showed
her
the
clip
she
watched
wordless
jaw
hanging
down
to
her
chest
post
that
she
said
post
that
post
that
post
that
post
that
i
posted
it
i
could
barely
type
as
i
wrote
it
up
describing
what
i
seen
adding
a
note
to
see
if
anyone
could
identify
the
military
man
in
the
video
if
anyone
knew
anything
about
this
i
hit
publish
we
watched
the
video
we
watched
it
again
my
email
pinged
i
totally
recognize
that
dude
you
can
find
his
bio
on
wikipedia
he
general
claude
geist
he
commanded
the
joint
un
peacekeeping
mission
in
haiti
i
checked
the
bio
there
was
a
picture
of
the
general
at
a
press
conference
and
notes
about
his
role
in
the
difficult
haiti
mission
it
was
clearly
the
same
guy
i
updated
the
post
theoretically
this
was
ange
and
my
chance
to
make
out
but
that
was
what
we
ended
up
doing
we
crawled
the
xnet
blogs
looking
for
more
accounts
of
the
dhs
searching
people
tackling
people
invading
them
this
was
a
familiar
task
the
same
thing
i
done
with
all
the
footage
and
accounts
from
the
riots
in
the
park
i
started
a
new
category
on
my
blog
for
this
abusesofauthority
and
filed
them
away
ange
kept
coming
up
with
new
search
terms
for
me
to
try
and
by
the
time
her
mom
got
home
my
new
category
had
seventy
posts
headlined
by
general
geist
city
hall
takedown
i
worked
on
my
beat
paper
all
the
next
day
at
home
reading
the
kerouac
and
surfing
the
xnet
i
was
planning
on
meeting
ange
at
school
but
i
totally
wimped
out
at
the
thought
of
seeing
van
again
so
i
texted
her
an
excuse
about
working
on
the
paper
there
were
all
kinds
of
great
suggestions
for
abusesofauthority
coming
in
hundreds
of
little
and
big
ones
pictures
and
audio
the
meme
was
spreading
it
spread
the
next
morning
there
were
even
more
someone
started
a
new
blog
called
abusesofauthority
that
collected
hundreds
more
the
pile
grew
we
competed
to
find
the
juiciest
stories
the
craziest
pictures
the
deal
with
my
parents
was
that
i
eat
breakfast
with
them
every
morning
and
talk
about
the
projects
i
was
doing
they
liked
that
i
was
reading
kerouac
it
had
been
a
favorite
book
of
both
of
theirs
and
it
turned
out
there
was
already
a
copy
on
the
bookcase
in
my
parents
room
my
dad
brought
it
down
and
i
flipped
through
it
there
were
passages
marked
up
with
pen
pages
notes
in
the
margin
my
dad
had
really
loved
this
book
it
made
me
remember
a
better
time
when
my
dad
and
i
had
been
able
to
talk
for
five
minutes
without
shouting
at
each
other
about
terrorism
and
we
had
a
great
breakfast
talking
about
the
way
that
the
novel
was
plotted
all
the
crazy
adventures
but
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
they
were
both
glued
to
the
radio
abuses
of
authority
it
the
latest
craze
on
san
francisco
notorious
xnet
and
it
captured
the
world
attention
called
the
movement
is
composed
of
brothers
who
watch
back
against
the
department

on
the

but
commentary
from
young

who
are
upset

has
been
fast
and
furious
most
notable
has
been
the
global

and
japan
and
broadcasters
around
the
world
have
aired
the
clip
on
news
the
issue
came
to
a
head
last
night
when
the
british
broadcasting
corporation
national
news
evening
program
ran
a
special
report
on
the
fact
that
no
american
broadcaster
or
news
agency
has
covered
this
story
commenters
on
the
bbc
website
noted
that
bbc
america
version
of
the
news
did
not
carry
the
report
they
brought
on
a
couple
of
interviews
british
media
watchdogs
a
swedish
pirate
party
kid
who
made
jeering
remarks
about
america
corrupt
press
a
retired
american
newscaster
living
in
tokyo
then
they
aired
a
short
clip
from
comparing
the
american
press
record
and
the
record
of
the
national
in
syria
i
felt
like
my
parents
were
staring
at
me
that
they
knew
what
i
was
doing
but
when
i
cleared
away
my
dishes
i
saw
that
they
were
looking
at
each
other
dad

holding
his
coffee
cup
so
hard
his
hands
were
shaking
mom
was
looking
at
him
they
trying
to
discredit
us
dad
said
finally
they
trying
to
sabotage
the
efforts
to
keep
us
safe
i
opened
my
mouth
but
my
mom
caught
my
eye
and
shook
her
head
instead
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
worked
on
my
kerouac
paper
once
i
heard
the
door
slam
twice
i
fired
up
my
xbox

politely

much
kerouac

that
day
hold
a
is
what
ange
said
as
we
sat
in
the
cafe
near
her
place
that
evening
i
was
keen
on
going
out
to
her
school
anymore
getting
stuck
on
a
bus
with
van
again
what
are
you
crazy

clockwork
plunder

pick
a
trading
post
where
there
no
pvp
allowed
and
name
a
time
you
can
login
from
here
pvp
is
combat
parts
of
clockwork
plunder
were
neutral
ground
which
meant
that
we
could
theoretically
bring
in
a
ton
of
noob
reporters
without
worrying
about
gamers
killing
them
in
the
middle
of
the
i
do
know
anything
about
press
conferences
oh
just
google
it
i
sure
someone
written
an
article
on
holding
a
successful
one
i
mean
if
the
president
can
manage
it
i
sure
you
can
he
looks
like
he
can
barely
tie
his
shoes
without
help
we
ordered
more
coffee
you
are
a
very
smart
woman
i
said
and
i
beautiful
she
said
that
too
i
said
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
the
national
canadian
megachain
i
was
working
at
bakka
the
independent
science
fiction
bookstore
when
chapters
opened
its
first
store
in
toronto
and
i
knew
that
something
big
was
going
on
right
away
because
two
of
our
smartest
customers
stopped
in
to
tell
me
that
they
been
hired
to
run
the
science
fiction
section
from
the
start
chapters
raised
the
bar
on
what
a
big
corporate
bookstore
could
be
extending
its
hours
adding
a
friendly
cafe
and
lots
of
seating
installing
terminals
and
stocking
the
most
amazing
variety
of
titles
http
i
blogged
the
even
before
i
sent
out
the
invitations
to
the
press
i
could
tell
that
all
these
writers
wanted
to
make
me
into
a
leader
or
a
general
or
a
supreme
guerrilla
commandant
and
i
figured
one
way
of
solving
that
would
be
to
have
a
bunch
of
xnetters
running
around
answering
questions
too
then
i
emailed
the
press
the
responses
ranged
from
puzzled
to
enthusiastic
only
the
fox
reporter
was
outraged
that
i
had
the
gall
to
ask
her
to
play
a
game
in
order
to
appear
on
her
tv
show
the
rest
of
them
seemed
to
think
that
it
would
make
a
pretty
cool
story
though
plenty
of
them
wanted
lots
of
tech
support
for
signing
onto
the
game
i
picked
after
dinner
mom
had
been
bugging
me
about
all
the
evenings
i
been
spending
out
of
the
house
until
i
finally
spilled
the
beans
about
ange
whereupon
she
came
over
all
misty
and
kept
looking
at
me
like
she
wanted
to
meet
ange
and
i
used
that
as
leverage
promising
to
bring
her
over
the
next
night
if
i
could
go
to
the
movies
with
ange
tonight
ange
mom
and
sister
were
out
again
they
were
real
which
left
me
and
ange
alone
in
her
room
with
her
xbox
and
mine
i
unplugged
one
of
her
bedside
screens
and
attached
my
xbox
to
it
so
that
we
could
both
login
at
once
both
xboxes
were
idle
logged
into
clockwork
plunder
i
was
pacing
it
going
to
be
fine
she
said
she
glanced
at
her
screen
patcheye
pete
market
has
players
in
it
now
we
picked
patcheye
pete
because
it
was
the
market
closest
to
the
village
square
where
new
players
spawned
if
the
reporters
were
already
clockwork
plunder
players
ha
then
that
where
they
show
up
in
my
blog
post
i
asked
people
generally
to
hang
out
on
the
route
between
patcheye
pete
and
the
and
direct
anyone
who
looked
like
a
disoriented
reporter
over
to
pete
what
the
hell
am
i
going
to
tell
them
you
just
answer
their
questions
and
if
you
do
like
a
question
ignore
it
someone
else
can
answer
it
it
be
fine
this
is
insane
this
is
perfect
marcus
if
you
want
to
really
screw
the
dhs
you
have
to
embarrass
them
it
not
like
you
going
to
be
able
to
them
your
only
weapon
is
your
ability
to
make
them
look
like
morons
i
flopped
on
the
bed
and
she
pulled
my
head
into
her
lap
and
stroked
my
hair
i
been
playing
around
with
different
haircuts
before
the
bombing
dying
it
all
kinds
of
funny
colors
but
since
i
gotten
out
of
jail
i
could
be
bothered
it
had
gotten
long
and
stupid
and
shaggy
and
i
gone
into
the
bathroom
and
grabbed
my
clippers
and
buzzed
it
down
to
half
an
inch
all
around
which
took
zero
effort
to
take
care
of
and
helped
me
to
be
invisible
when
i
was
out
jamming
and
cloning
arphids
i
opened
my
eyes
and
stared
into
her
big
brown
eyes
behind
her
glasses
they
were
round
and
liquid
and
expressive
she
could
make
them
bug
out
when
she
wanted
to
make
me
laugh
or
make
them
soft
and
sad
or
lazy
and
sleepy
in
a
way
that
made
me
melt
into
a
puddle
of
horniness
that
what
she
was
doing
right
now
i
sat
up
slowly
and
hugged
her
she
hugged
me
back
we
kissed
she
was
an
amazing
kisser
i
know
i
already
said
that
but
it
bears
repeating
we
kissed
a
lot
but
for
one
reason
or
another
we
always
stopped
before
it
got
too
heavy
now
i
wanted
to
go
farther
i
found
the
hem
of
her
and
tugged
she
put
her
hands
over
her
head
and
pulled
back
a
few
inches
i
knew
that
she
do
that
i
known
since
the
night
in
the
park
maybe
that
why
we
had
gone
farther
i
knew
i
could
rely
on
her
to
back
off
which
scared
me
a
little
but
i
was
scared
then
the
impending
the
fights
with
my
parents
the
international
attention
the
sense
that
there
was
a
movement
that
was
careening
around
the
city
like
a
wild
pinball
it
made
my
skin
tingle
and
my
blood
sing
and
she
was
beautiful
and
smart
and
clever
and
funny
and
i
was
falling
in
love
with
her
her
shirt
slid
off
her
arching
her
back
to
help
me
get
it
over
her
shoulders
she
reached
behind
her
and
did
something
and
her
bra
fell
away
i
stared
motionless
and
breathless
and
then
she
grabbed
shirt
and
pulled
it
over
my
head
grabbing
me
and
pulling
my
bare
chest
to
hers
we
rolled
on
the
bed
and
touched
each
other
and
ground
our
bodies
together
and
groaned
she
kissed
all
over
my
chest
and
i
did
the
same
to
her
i
could
breathe
i
could
think
i
could
only
move
and
kiss
and
lick
and
touch
we
dared
each
other
to
go
forward
i
undid
her
jeans
she
undid
mine
i
lowered
her
zipper
she
did
mine
and
tugged
my
jeans
off
i
tugged
off
hers
a
moment
later
we
were
both
naked
except
for
my
socks
which
i
peeled
off
with
my
toes
it
was
then
that
i
caught
sight
of
the
bedside
clock
which
had
long
ago
rolled
onto
the
floor
and
lay
there
glowing
up
at
us
crap
i
yelped
it
starts
in
two
minutes
i
could
freaking
believe
that
i
was
about
to
stop
what
i
was
about
to
stop
doing
when
i
was
about
to
stop
doing
it
i
mean
if
you
asked
me
marcus
you
are
about
to
get
laid
for
the
firstest
time
evar
will
you
stop
if
i
let
off
this
nuclear
bomb
in
the
same
room
as
you
the
answer
would
have
been
a
resounding
and
unequivocal
and
yet
we
stopped
for
this
she
grabbed
me
and
pulled
my
face
to
hers
and
kissed
me
until
i
thought
i
would
pass
out
then
we
both
grabbed
our
clothes
and
more
or
less
dressed
grabbing
our
keyboards
and
mice
and
heading
for
patcheye
pete
you
could
easily
tell
who
the
press
were
they
were
the
noobs
who
played
their
characters
like
staggering
drunks
weaving
back
and
forth
and
up
and
down
trying
to
get
the
hang
of
it
all
occasionally
hitting
the
wrong
key
and
offering
strangers
all
or
part
of
their
inventory
or
giving
them
accidental
hugs
and
kicks
the
xnetters
were
easy
to
spot
too
we
all
played
clockwork
plunder
whenever
we
had
some
spare
time
or
did
feel
like
doing
our
homework
and
we
had
pretty
characters
with
cool
weapons
and
on
the
keys
sticking
out
of
our
backs
that
would
cream
anyone
who
tried
to
snatch
them
and
leave
us
to
wind
down
when
i
appeared
a
system
status
message
displayed
has
entered
patcheye
pete
welcome
swabbie
we
offer
fair
trade
for
fine
booty
all
the
players
on
the
screen
froze
then
they
crowded
around
me
the
chat
exploded
i
thought
about
turning
on
my
and
grabbing
a
headset
but
seeing
how
many
people
were
trying
to
talk
at
once
i
realized
how
confusing
that
would
be
text
was
much
easier
to
follow
and
they
could
misquote
me
heh
heh
i
scouted
the
location
before
with
ange
it
was
great
campaigning
with
her
since
we
could
both
keep
each
other
wound
up
there
was
a
on
a
pile
of
boxes
of
that
i
could
stand
on
and
be
seen
from
anywhere
in
the
market
good
evening
and
thank
you
all
for
coming
my
name
is
and
i
not
the
leader
of
anything
all
around
you
are
xnetters
who
have
as
much
to
say
about
why
we
here
as
i
do
i
use
the
xnet
because
i
believe
in
freedom
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
i
use
xnet
because
the
dhs
has
turned
my
city
into
a
where
we
all
suspected
terrorists
i
use
xnet
because
i
think
you
ca
defend
freedom
by
tearing
up
the
bill
of
rights
i
learned
about
the
constitution
in
a
california
school
and
i
was
raised
to
love
my
country
for
its
freedom
if
i
have
a
philosophy
it
is
this
governments
are
instituted
among
men
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
it
and
to
institute
new
government
laying
its
foundation
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
i
did
write
that
but
i
believe
it
the
dhs
does
not
govern
with
my
consent
thank
you
i
written
this
the
day
before
bouncing
drafts
back
and
forth
with
ange
pasting
it
in
only
took
a
second
though
it
took
everyone
in
the
game
a
moment
to
read
it
a
lot
of
the
xnetters
cheered
big
showy
pirate
hurrah
s
with
raised
sabers
and
pet
parrots
squawking
and
flying
overhead
gradually
the
journalists
digested
it
too
the
chat
was
running
past
fast
so
fast
you
could
barely
read
it
lots
of
xnetters
saying
things
like
right
on
and
america
love
it
or
leave
it
and
dhs
go
home
and
america
out
of
san
francisco
all
slogans
that
had
been
big
on
the
xnet
blogosphere
this
is
priya
rajneesh
from
the
bbc
you
say
you
not
the
leader
of
any
movement
but
do
you
believe
there
is
a
movement
is
it
called
the
xnet
lots
of
answers
some
people
said
there
was
a
movement
some
said
there
was
and
lots
of
people
had
ideas
about
what
it
was
called
xnet
little
brothers
little
sisters
and
my
personal
favorite
the
united
states
of
america
they
were
really
cooking
i
let
them
go
thinking
of
what
i
could
say
once
i
had
it
i
typed
i
think
that
kind
of
answers
your
question
does
it
there
may
be
one
or
more
movements
and
they
may
be
called
xnet
or
not
i
doug
christensen
from
the
washington
internet
daily
what
do
you
think
the
dhs
should
be
doing
to
prevent
another
attack
on
san
francisco
if
what
they
doing
is
successful
more
chatter
lots
of
people
said
that
the
terrorists
and
the
government
were
the
same
either
literally
or
just
meaning
that
they
were
equally
bad
some
said
the
government
knew
how
to
catch
terrorists
but
preferred
not
to
because
war
presidents
got
i
do
know
i
typed
finally
i
really
do
i
ask
myself
this
question
a
lot
because
i
do
want
to
get
blown
up
and
i
do
want
my
city
to
get
blown
up
here
what
i
figured
out
though
if
it
the
dhs
job
to
keep
us
safe
they
failing
all
the
crap
they
done
none
of
it
would
stop
the
bridge
from
being
blown
up
again
tracing
us
around
the
city
taking
away
our
freedom
making
us
suspicious
of
each
other
turning
us
against
each
other
calling
dissenters
traitors
the
point
of
terrorism
is
to
terrify
us
the
dhs
terrifies
me
i
do
have
any
say
in
what
the
terrorists
do
to
me
but
if
this
is
a
free
country
then
i
should
be
able
to
at
least
say
what
my
own
cops
do
to
me
i
should
be
able
to
keep
them
from
terrorizing
me
i
know
that
not
a
good
answer
sorry
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
the
dhs
would
stop
terrorists
how
do
you
know
who
are
you
i
with
the
sydney
morning
herald
i
years
old
i
not
a
student
or
anything
even
so
i
figured
out
how
to
make
an
internet
that
they
ca
wiretap
i
figured
out
how
to
jam
their
technology
i
can
turn
innocent
people
into
suspects
and
turn
guilty
people
into
innocents
in
their
eyes
i
could
get
metal
onto
an
airplane
or
beat
a
list
i
figured
this
stuff
out
by
looking
at
the
web
and
by
thinking
about
it
if
i
can
do
it
terrorists
can
do
it
they
told
us
they
took
away
our
freedom
to
make
us
safe
do
you
feel
safe
in
australia
why
yes
i
do
the
pirates
all
laughed
more
journalists
asked
questions
some
were
sympathetic
some
were
hostile
when
i
got
tired
i
handed
my
keyboard
to
ange
and
let
her
be
for
a
while
it
did
really
feel
like
and
me
were
the
same
person
anymore
anyway
was
the
kind
of
kid
who
talked
to
international
journalists
and
inspired
a
movement
marcus
got
suspended
from
school
and
fought
with
his
dad
and
wondered
if
he
was
good
enough
for
his
girlfriend
by
i
had
enough
besides
my
parents
would
be
expecting
me
home
soon
i
logged
out
of
the
game
and
so
did
ange
and
we
lay
there
for
a
moment
i
took
her
hand
and
she
squeezed
hard
we
hugged
she
kissed
my
neck
and
murmured
something
what
i
said
i
love
you
she
said
what
you
want
me
to
send
you
a
telegram
wow
i
said
you
that
surprised
huh
no
um
it
just
i
was
going
to
say
that
to
you
sure
you
were
she
said
and
bit
the
tip
of
my
nose
it
just
that
i
never
said
it
before
i
said
so
i
was
working
up
to
it
you
still
have
said
it
you
know
do
think
i
have
noticed
we
girls
pick
upon
these
things
i
love
you
ange
carvelli
i
said
i
love
you
too
marcus
yallow
we
kissed
and
nuzzled
and
i
started
to
breathe
hard
and
so
did
she
that
when
her
mom
knocked
on
the
door
angela
she
said
i
think
it
time
your
friend
went
home
do
you
yes
mother
she
said
and
mimed
swinging
an
axe
as
i
put
my
socks
and
shoes
on
she
muttered
they
say
that
angela
she
was
such
a
good
girl
who
would
have
thought
it
all
the
time
she
was
in
the
back
yard
helping
her
mother
out
by
sharpening
that
hatchet
i
laughed
you
do
know
how
easy
you
have
it
there
is
my
folks
would
leave
us
alone
in
my
bedroom
until
she
said
checking
her
clock
crap
i
yelped
and
tied
my
shoes
go
she
said
run
and
be
free
look
both
ways
before
crossing
the
road
write
if
you
get
work
do
even
stop
for
a
hug
if
you
not
out
of
here
by
the
count
of
ten
there
going
to
be
mister
one
two
three
i
shut
her
up
by
leaping
onto
the
bed
landing
on
her
and
kissing
her
until
she
stopped
trying
to
count
satisfied
with
my
victory
i
pounded
down
the
stairs
my
xbox
under
my
arm
her
mom
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
we
only
met
a
couple
times
she
looked
like
an
older
taller
version
of
ange
ange
said
her
father
was
the
short
one
with
contacts
instead
of
glasses
she
seemed
to
have
tentatively
classed
me
as
a
good
guy
and
i
appreciated
it
good
night
mrs
carvelli
i
said
good
night
mr
yallow
she
said
it
was
one
of
our
little
rituals
ever
since
i
called
her
mrs
carvelli
when
we
first
met
i
found
myself
standing
awkwardly
by
the
door
yes
she
said
um
i
said
thanks
for
having
me
over
you
always
welcome
in
our
home
young
man
she
said
and
thanks
for
ange
i
said
finally
hating
how
lame
it
sounded
but
she
smiled
broadly
and
gave
me
a
brief
hug
you
very
welcome
she
said
the
whole
bus
ride
home
i
thought
over
the
thought
about
ange
naked
and
writhing
with
me
on
her
bed
thought
about
her
mother
smiling
and
showing
me
the
door
my
mom
was
waiting
up
for
me
she
asked
me
about
the
movie
and
i
gave
her
the
response
i
worked
out
in
advance
cribbing
from
the
review
it
had
gotten
in
the
as
i
fell
asleep
the
came
back
i
was
really
proud
of
it
it
had
been
so
cool
to
have
all
these
journos
show
up
in
the
game
to
have
them
listen
to
me
and
to
have
them
listen
to
all
the
people
who
believed
in
the
same
things
as
me
i
dropped
off
with
a
smile
on
my
lips
i
should
have
known
better
xnet
leader
i
could
get
metal
onto
an
airplane
dhs
does
have
my
consent
to
govern
xnet
kids
usa
out
of
san
francisco
those
were
the
headlines
everyone
sent
me
the
articles
to
blog
but
it
was
the
last
thing
i
wanted
to
do
i
blown
it
somehow
the
press
had
come
to
my
and
concluded
that
we
were
terrorists
or
terrorist
dupes
the
worst
was
the
reporter
on
fox
news
who
had
apparently
shown
up
anyway
and
who
devoted
a
commentary
to
us
talking
about
our
criminal
treason
her
killer
line
repeated
on
every
i
found
was
they
say
they
do
have
a
name
i
got
one
for
them
let
call
these
spoiled
children
they
do
the
terrorists
work
on
the
home
front
when
not
if
but
when
california
gets
attacked
again
these
brats
will
be
as
much
to
blame
as
the
house
of
saud
leaders
of
the
movement
denounced
us
as
fringe
elements
one
guy
went
on
tv
to
say
that
he
believed
we
had
been
fabricated
by
the
dhs
to
discredit
them
the
dhs
had
their
own
announcing
that
they
would
double
the
security
in
san
francisco
they
held
up
an
arphid
cloner
they
found
somewhere
and
demonstrated
it
in
action
using
it
to
stage
a
and
warned
everyone
to
be
on
their
alert
for
young
people
behaving
suspiciously
especially
those
whose
hands
were
out
of
sight
they
were
kidding
i
finished
my
kerouac
paper
and
started
in
on
a
paper
about
the
summer
of
love
the
summer
of
when
the
movement
and
the
hippies
converged
on
san
francisco
the
guys
who
founded
ben
and
jerry
old
hippies
themselves
had
founded
a
hippie
museum
in
the
haight
and
there
were
other
archives
and
exhibits
to
see
around
town
but
it
was
easy
getting
around
by
the
end
of
the
week
i
was
getting
frisked
an
average
of
four
times
a
day
cops
checked
my
id
and
questioned
me
about
why
i
was
out
in
the
street
carefully
eyeballing
the
letter
from
chavez
saying
that
i
was
suspended
i
got
lucky
no
one
arrested
me
but
the
rest
of
the
xnet
were
so
lucky
every
night
the
dhs
announced
more
arrests
ringleaders
and
operatives
of
xnet
people
i
did
know
and
had
never
heard
of
paraded
on
tv
along
with
the
arphid
sniffers
and
other
devices
that
had
been
in
their
pockets
they
announced
that
the
people
were
naming
names
compromising
the
xnet
network
and
that
more
arrests
were
expected
soon
the
name
was
often
heard
dad
loved
this
he
and
i
watched
the
news
together
him
gloating
me
shrinking
away
quietly
freaking
out
you
should
see
the
stuff
they
going
to
use
on
these
kids
dad
said
i
seen
it
in
action
they
get
a
couple
of
these
kids
and
check
out
their
friends
lists
on
im
and
the
on
their
phones
look
for
names
that
come
up
over
and
over
look
for
patterns
bringing
in
more
kids
they
going
to
unravel
them
like
an
old
sweater
i
canceled
ange
dinner
at
our
place
and
started
spending
even
more
time
there
ange
little
sister
tina
started
to
call
me
the
as
in
is
the
eating
dinner
with
me
tonight
i
liked
tina
all
she
cared
about
was
going
out
and
partying
and
meeting
guys
but
she
was
funny
and
utterly
devoted
to
ange
one
night
as
we
were
doing
the
dishes
she
dried
her
hands
and
said
conversationally
you
know
you
seem
like
a
nice
guy
marcus
my
sister
just
crazy
about
you
and
i
like
you
too
but
i
have
to
tell
you
something
if
you
break
her
heart
i
will
track
you
down
and
pull
your
scrotum
over
your
head
it
not
a
pretty
sight
i
assured
her
that
i
would
sooner
pull
my
own
scrotum
over
my
head
than
break
ange
heart
and
she
nodded
so
long
as
we
clear
on
that
your
sister
is
a
nut
i
said
as
we
lay
on
ange
bed
again
looking
at
xnet
blogs
that
is
pretty
much
all
we
did
fool
around
and
read
xnet
did
she
use
the
scrotum
line
on
you
i
hate
it
when
she
does
that
she
just
loves
the
word
you
know
it
nothing
personal
i
kissed
her
we
read
some
more
listen
to
this
she
said
police
project
four
to
six
arrests
this
weekend
in
what
they
say
will
be
the
largest
coordinated
raid
on
xnet
dissidents
to
date
i
felt
like
throwing
up
we
got
to
stop
this
i
said
you
know
there
are
people
who
are
doing
jamming
to
show
that
they
not
intimidated
is
that
just
i
think
it
brave
she
said
we
ca
let
them
scare
us
into
submission
what
no
ange
no
we
ca
let
hundreds
of
people
go
to
you
have
been
there
i
have
it
worse
than
you
think
it
worse
than
you
can
imagine
i
have
a
pretty
fertile
imagination
she
said
stop
it
ok
be
serious
for
a
second
i
wo
do
this
i
wo
send
those
people
to
jail
if
i
do
i
the
guy
that
van
thinks
i
am
marcus
i
being
serious
you
think
that
these
people
do
know
they
could
go
to
jail
they
believe
in
the
cause
you
believe
in
it
too
give
them
the
credit
to
know
what
they
getting
into
it
not
up
to
you
to
decide
what
risks
they
can
or
ca
take
it
my
responsibility
because
if
i
tell
them
to
stop
they
stop
i
thought
you
were
the
leader
i
not
of
course
i
not
but
i
ca
help
it
if
they
look
to
me
for
guidance
and
so
long
as
they
do
i
have
a
responsibility
to
help
them
stay
safe
you
see
that
right
all
i
see
is
you
getting
ready
to
cut
and
run
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble
i
think
you
afraid
they
going
to
figure
out
who
are
i
think
you
afraid
for
that
not
fair
i
said
sitting
up
pulling
away
from
her
really
who
the
guy
who
nearly
had
a
heart
attack
when
he
thought
that
his
secret
identity
was
out
that
was
different
i
said
this
is
about
me
you
know
it
is
why
are
you
being
like
this
why
are
like
this
she
said
why
are
willing
to
be
the
guy
who
was
brave
enough
to
get
all
this
started
this
is
brave
it
suicide
cheap
teenage
melodrama
do
call
me
that
what
why
not
i
put
my
shoes
on
i
picked
up
my
bag
i
walked
home
why
i
not
jamming
i
wo
tell
anyone
else
what
to
do
because
i
not
anyone
leader
no
matter
what
fox
news
thinks
but
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
plan
on
doing
if
you
think
that
the
right
thing
to
do
maybe
you
do
it
too
i
not
jamming
not
this
week
maybe
not
next
it
not
because
i
scared
it
because
i
smart
enough
to
know
that
i
better
free
than
in
prison
they
figured
out
how
to
stop
our
tactic
so
we
need
to
come
up
with
a
new
tactic
i
do
care
what
the
tactic
is
but
i
want
it
to
work
it
to
get
arrested
it
only
jamming
if
you
get
away
with
it
there
another
reason
not
to
jam
if
you
get
caught
they
might
use
you
to
catch
your
friends
and
their
friends
and
their
friends
they
might
bust
your
friends
even
if
they
not
on
xnet
because
the
dhs
is
like
a
maddened
bull
and
they
do
exactly
worry
if
they
got
the
right
guy
i
not
telling
you
what
to
do
but
the
dhs
is
dumb
and
we
smart
jamming
proves
that
they
ca
fight
terrorism
because
it
proves
that
they
ca
even
stop
a
bunch
of
kids
if
you
get
caught
it
makes
them
look
like
they
smarter
than
us
they
are
smarter
than
us
we
are
smarter
than
them
let
be
smart
let
figure
out
how
to
jam
them
no
matter
how
many
goons
they
put
on
the
streets
of
our
city
i
posted
it
i
went
to
bed
i
missed
ange
ange
and
i
did
speak
for
the
next
four
days
including
the
weekend
and
then
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
school
i
almost
called
her
a
million
times
written
a
thousand
unsent
emails
and
ims
now
i
was
back
in
social
studies
class
and
mrs
andersen
greeted
me
with
voluble
sarcastic
courtesy
asking
me
sweetly
how
my
holiday
had
been
i
sat
down
and
mumbled
nothing
i
could
hear
charles
snicker
she
taught
us
a
class
on
manifest
destiny
the
idea
that
the
americans
were
destined
to
take
over
the
whole
world
or
at
least
that
how
she
made
it
seem
and
seemed
to
be
trying
to
provoke
me
into
saying
something
so
she
could
throw
me
out
i
felt
the
eyes
of
the
class
on
me
and
it
reminded
me
of
and
the
people
who
looked
up
to
him
i
was
sick
of
being
looked
up
to
i
missed
ange
i
got
through
the
rest
of
the
day
without
anything
making
any
kind
of
mark
on
me
i
do
think
i
said
eight
words
finally
it
was
over
and
i
hit
the
doors
heading
for
the
gates
and
the
stupid
mission
and
my
pointless
house
i
was
barely
out
the
gate
when
someone
crashed
into
me
he
was
a
young
homeless
guy
maybe
my
age
maybe
a
little
older
he
wore
a
long
greasy
overcoat
a
pair
of
baggy
jeans
and
rotting
sneakers
that
looked
like
they
been
through
a
his
long
hair
hung
over
his
face
and
he
had
a
pubic
beard
that
straggled
down
his
throat
into
the
collar
of
a
knit
sweater
i
took
this
all
in
as
we
lay
next
to
each
other
on
the
sidewalk
people
passing
us
and
giving
us
weird
looks
it
seemed
that
he
crashed
into
me
while
hurrying
down
valencia
bent
over
with
the
burden
of
a
split
backpack
that
lay
beside
him
on
the
pavement
covered
in
tight
geometric
doodles
in
he
got
to
his
knees
and
rocked
back
and
forth
like
he
was
drunk
or
had
hit
his
head
sorry
buddy
he
said
did
see
you
you
hurt
i
sat
up
too
nothing
felt
hurt
um
no
it
he
stood
up
and
smiled
his
teeth
were
shockingly
white
and
straight
like
an
ad
for
an
orthodontic
clinic
he
held
his
hand
out
to
me
and
his
grip
was
strong
and
firm
i
really
sorry
his
voice
was
also
clear
and
intelligent
i
expected
him
to
sound
like
the
drunks
who
talked
to
themselves
as
they
roamed
the
mission
late
at
night
but
he
sounded
like
a
knowledgeable
bookstore
clerk
it
no
problem
i
said
he
stuck
out
his
hand
again
zeb
he
said
marcus
i
said
a
pleasure
marcus
he
said
hope
to
run
into
you
again
sometime
laughing
he
picked
up
his
backpack
turned
on
his
heel
and
hurried
away
i
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
home
in
a
bemused
fug
mom
was
at
the
kitchen
table
and
we
had
a
little
chat
about
nothing
at
all
the
way
we
used
to
do
before
everything
changed
i
took
the
stairs
up
to
my
room
and
flopped
down
in
my
chair
for
once
i
did
want
to
login
to
the
xnet
i
checked
in
that
morning
before
school
to
discover
that
my
note
had
created
a
gigantic
controversy
among
people
who
agreed
with
me
and
people
who
were
righteously
pissed
that
i
was
telling
them
to
back
off
from
their
beloved
sport
i
had
three
thousand
projects
i
been
in
the
middle
of
when
it
had
all
started
i
was
building
a
pinhole
camera
out
of
legos
i
been
playing
with
aerial
kite
photography
using
an
old
digital
camera
with
a
trigger
hacked
out
of
silly
putty
that
was
stretched
out
at
launch
and
slowly
snapped
back
to
its
original
shape
triggering
the
shutter
at
regular
intervals
i
had
a
vacuum
tube
amp
i
been
building
into
an
ancient
rusted
dented
tin
that
looked
like
an
archaeological
find
once
it
was
done
i
planned
to
build
in
a
dock
for
my
phone
and
a
set
of
speakers
out
of
cans
i
looked
over
my
workbench
and
finally
picked
up
the
pinhole
camera
methodically
snapping
legos
together
was
just
about
my
speed
i
took
off
my
watch
and
the
chunky
silver
ring
that
showed
a
monkey
and
a
ninja
squaring
off
to
fight
and
dropped
them
into
the
little
box
i
used
for
all
the
crap
i
load
into
my
pockets
and
around
my
neck
before
stepping
out
for
the
day
phone
wallet
keys
wifinder
change
batteries
retractable
cables
i
dumped
it
all
out
into
the
box
and
found
myself
holding
something
i
did
remember
putting
in
there
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
grey
and
soft
as
flannel
furry
at
the
edges
where
it
had
been
torn
away
from
some
larger
piece
of
paper
it
was
covered
in
the
tiniest
most
careful
handwriting
i
ever
seen
i
unfolded
it
and
held
it
up
the
writing
covered
both
sides
running
down
from
the
top
left
corner
of
one
side
to
a
crabbed
signature
at
the
bottom
right
corner
of
the
other
side
the
signature
read
simply
zeb
i
picked
it
up
and
started
to
read
dear
marcus
you
do
know
me
but
i
know
you
for
the
past
three
months
since
the
bay
bridge
was
blown
up
i
have
been
imprisoned
on
treasure
island
i
was
in
the
yard
on
the
day
you
talked
to
that
asian
girl
and
got
tackled
you
were
brave
good
on
you
i
had
a
burst
appendix
the
day
afterward
and
ended
up
in
the
infirmary
in
the
next
bed
was
a
guy
named
darryl
we
were
both
in
recovery
for
a
long
time
and
by
the
time
we
got
well
we
were
too
much
of
an
embarrassment
to
them
to
let
go
so
they
decided
we
must
really
be
guilty
they
questioned
us
every
day
you
been
through
their
questioning
i
know
imagine
it
for
months
darryl
and
i
ended
up
we
knew
we
were
bugged
so
we
only
talked
about
inconsequentialities
but
at
night
when
we
were
in
our
cots
we
would
softly
tap
out
messages
to
each
other
in
morse
code
i
knew
my
ham
radio
days
would
come
in
useful
sometime
at
first
their
questions
to
us
were
just
the
same
crap
as
ever
who
did
it
how
they
do
it
but
after
a
little
while
they
switched
to
asking
us
about
the
xnet
of
course
we
never
heard
of
it
that
did
stop
them
asking
darryl
told
me
that
they
brought
him
arphid
cloners
xboxes
all
kinds
of
technology
and
demanded
that
he
tell
them
who
used
them
where
they
learned
to
mod
them
darryl
told
me
about
your
games
and
the
things
you
learned
especially
the
dhs
asked
us
about
our
friends
who
did
we
know
what
were
they
like
did
they
have
political
feelings
had
they
been
in
trouble
at
school
with
the
law
we
call
the
prison
it
been
a
week
since
i
got
out
and
i
do
think
that
anyone
knows
that
their
sons
and
daughters
are
imprisoned
in
the
middle
of
the
bay
at
night
we
could
hear
people
laughing
and
partying
on
the
mainland
i
got
out
last
week
i
wo
tell
you
how
in
case
this
falls
into
the
wrong
hands
maybe
others
will
take
my
route
darryl
told
me
how
to
find
you
and
made
me
promise
to
tell
you
what
i
knew
when
i
got
back
now
that
i
done
that
i
out
of
here
like
last
year
one
way
or
another
i
leaving
this
country
screw
america
stay
strong
they
scared
of
you
kick
them
for
me
do
get
caught
zeb
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
as
i
finished
the
note
i
had
a
disposable
lighter
somewhere
on
my
desk
that
i
sometimes
used
to
melt
the
insulation
off
of
wires
and
i
dug
it
out
and
held
it
to
the
note
i
knew
i
owed
it
to
zeb
to
destroy
it
and
make
sure
no
one
else
ever
saw
it
in
case
it
might
lead
them
back
to
him
wherever
he
was
going
i
held
the
flame
and
the
note
but
i
could
do
it
darryl
with
all
the
crap
with
the
xnet
and
ange
and
the
dhs
i
almost
forgotten
he
existed
he
become
a
ghost
like
an
old
friend
who
moved
away
or
gone
on
an
exchange
program
all
that
time
they
been
questioning
him
demanding
that
he
rat
me
out
explain
the
xnet
the
jammers
he
been
on
treasure
island
the
abandoned
military
base
that
was
halfway
along
the
demolished
span
of
the
bay
bridge
he
been
so
close
i
could
have
swam
to
him
i
put
the
lighter
down
and
the
note
by
the
time
it
was
done
i
was
weeping
sobbing
it
all
came
back
to
me
the
lady
with
the
severe
haircut
and
the
questions
she
asked
and
the
reek
of
piss
and
the
stiffness
of
my
pants
as
the
urine
dried
them
into
coarse
canvas
marcus
my
door
was
ajar
and
my
mother
was
standing
in
it
watching
me
with
a
worried
look
how
long
had
she
been
there
i
armed
the
tears
away
from
my
face
and
snorted
up
the
snot
mom
i
said
hi
she
came
into
my
room
and
hugged
me
what
is
it
do
you
need
to
talk
the
note
lay
on
the
table
is
that
from
your
girlfriend
is
everything
all
right
she
given
me
an
out
i
could
just
blame
it
all
on
problems
with
ange
and
she
leave
my
room
and
leave
me
alone
i
opened
my
mouth
to
do
just
that
and
then
this
came
out
i
was
in
jail
after
the
bridge
blew
i
was
in
jail
for
that
whole
time
the
sobs
that
came
then
did
sound
like
my
voice
they
sounded
like
an
animal
noise
maybe
a
donkey
or
some
kind
of
big
cat
noise
in
the
night
i
sobbed
so
my
throat
burned
and
ached
with
it
so
my
chest
heaved
mom
took
me
in
her
arms
the
way
she
used
to
when
i
was
a
little
boy
and
she
stroked
my
hair
and
she
murmured
in
my
ear
and
rocked
me
and
gradually
slowly
the
sobs
dissipated
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
mom
got
me
a
glass
of
water
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
and
she
sat
in
my
desk
chair
and
i
told
her
everything
everything
well
most
of
it
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
san
francisco
booksmith
ensconced
in
the
storied
neighborhood
just
a
few
doors
down
from
the
ben
and
jerry
at
the
exact
corner
of
haight
and
ashbury
the
booksmith
folks
really
know
how
to
run
an
author
event
when
i
lived
in
san
francisco
i
used
to
go
down
all
the
time
to
hear
incredible
writers
speak
william
gibson
was
unforgettable
they
also
produce
little
trading
cards
for
each
author
i
have
two
from
my
own
appearances
there
booksmith
http
haight
san
francisco
ca
usa
at
first
mom
looked
shocked
then
outraged
and
finally
she
gave
up
altogether
and
just
let
her
jaw
hang
open
as
i
took
her
through
the
interrogation
pissing
myself
the
bag
over
my
head
darryl
i
showed
her
the
note
why
in
that
single
syllable
every
recrimination
i
dealt
myself
in
the
night
every
moment
that
i
lacked
the
bravery
to
tell
the
world
what
it
was
really
about
why
i
was
really
fighting
what
had
really
inspired
the
xnet
i
sucked
in
a
breath
they
told
me
i
go
to
jail
if
i
talked
about
it
not
just
for
a
few
days
forever
i
was
i
was
scared
mom
sat
with
me
for
a
long
time
not
saying
anything
then
what
about
darryl
father
she
might
as
well
have
stuck
a
knitting
needle
in
my
chest
darryl
father
he
must
have
assumed
that
darryl
was
dead
long
dead
and
was
he
after
the
dhs
has
held
you
illegally
for
three
months
would
they
ever
let
you
go
but
zeb
got
out
maybe
darryl
would
get
out
maybe
me
and
the
xnet
could
help
get
darryl
out
i
have
told
him
i
said
now
mom
was
crying
she
did
cry
easily
it
was
a
british
thing
it
made
her
little
hiccoughing
sobs
much
worse
to
hear
you
will
tell
him
she
managed
you
will
i
will
but
first
we
have
to
tell
your
father
dad
no
longer
had
any
regular
time
when
he
came
home
between
his
consulting
clients
who
had
lots
of
work
now
that
the
dhs
was
shopping
for
startups
on
the
peninsula
and
the
long
commute
to
berkeley
he
might
get
home
any
time
between
and
midnight
tonight
mom
called
him
and
told
him
he
was
coming
home
he
said
something
and
she
just
repeated
it
when
he
got
there
we
had
arranged
ourselves
in
the
living
room
with
the
note
between
us
on
the
coffee
table
it
was
easier
to
tell
the
second
time
the
secret
was
getting
lighter
i
did
embellish
i
did
hide
anything
i
came
clean
i
heard
of
coming
clean
before
but
i
never
understood
what
it
meant
until
i
did
it
holding
in
the
secret
had
dirtied
me
soiled
my
spirit
it
had
made
me
afraid
and
ashamed
it
had
made
me
into
all
the
things
that
ange
said
i
was
dad
sat
stiff
as
a
ramrod
the
whole
time
his
face
carved
of
stone
when
i
handed
him
the
note
he
read
it
twice
and
then
set
it
down
carefully
he
shook
his
head
and
stood
up
and
headed
for
the
front
door
where
are
you
going
mom
asked
alarmed
i
need
a
walk
was
all
he
managed
to
gasp
his
voice
breaking
we
stared
awkwardly
at
each
other
mom
and
me
and
waited
for
him
to
come
home
i
tried
to
imagine
what
was
going
on
in
his
head
he
been
such
a
different
man
after
the
bombings
and
i
knew
from
mom
that
what
had
changed
him
were
the
days
of
thinking
i
was
dead
he
come
to
believe
that
the
terrorists
had
nearly
killed
his
son
and
it
had
made
him
crazy
crazy
enough
to
do
whatever
the
dhs
asked
to
line
up
like
a
good
little
sheep
and
let
them
control
him
drive
him
now
he
knew
that
it
was
the
dhs
that
had
imprisoned
me
the
dhs
that
had
taken
san
francisco
children
hostage
in
it
made
perfect
sense
now
that
i
thought
of
it
of
course
it
had
been
treasure
island
where
i
been
kept
where
else
was
a
from
san
francisco
when
dad
came
back
he
looked
angrier
than
he
ever
had
in
his
life
you
should
have
told
me
he
roared
mom
interposed
herself
between
him
and
me
you
blaming
the
wrong
person
she
said
it
was
marcus
who
did
the
kidnapping
and
the
intimidation
he
shook
his
head
and
stamped
i
not
blaming
marcus
i
know
who
to
blame
me
me
and
the
stupid
dhs
get
your
shoes
on
grab
your
coats
where
are
we
going
to
see
darryl
father
then
we
going
to
barbara
stratford
place
i
knew
the
name
barbara
stratford
from
somewhere
but
i
could
remember
where
i
thought
that
maybe
she
was
an
old
friend
of
my
parents
but
i
could
exactly
place
her
meantime
i
was
headed
for
darryl
father
place
i
never
really
felt
comfortable
around
the
old
man
who
been
a
navy
radio
operator
and
ran
his
household
like
a
tight
ship
he
taught
darryl
morse
code
when
he
was
a
kid
which
i
always
thought
was
cool
it
was
one
of
the
ways
i
knew
that
i
could
trust
zeb
letter
but
for
every
cool
thing
like
morse
code
darryl
father
had
some
crazy
military
discipline
that
seemed
to
be
for
its
own
sake
like
insisting
on
hospital
corners
on
the
beds
and
shaving
twice
a
day
it
drove
darryl
up
the
wall
darryl
mother
had
liked
it
much
either
and
had
taken
off
back
to
her
family
in
minnesota
when
darryl
was
ten
darryl
spent
his
summers
and
christmases
there
i
was
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
car
and
i
could
see
the
back
of
dad
head
as
he
drove
the
muscles
in
his
neck
were
tense
and
kept
jumping
around
as
he
ground
his
jaws
mom
kept
her
hand
on
his
arm
but
no
one
was
around
to
comfort
me
if
only
i
could
call
ange
or
jolu
or
van
maybe
i
would
when
the
day
was
done
he
must
have
buried
his
son
in
his
mind
dad
said
as
we
whipped
up
through
the
hairpin
curves
leading
up
twin
peaks
to
the
little
cottage
that
darryl
and
his
father
shared
the
fog
was
on
twin
peaks
the
way
it
often
was
at
night
in
san
francisco
making
the
headlamps
reflect
back
on
us
each
time
we
swung
around
a
corner
i
saw
the
valleys
of
the
city
laid
out
below
us
bowls
of
twinkling
lights
that
shifted
in
the
mist
is
this
the
one
yes
i
said
this
is
it
i
had
been
to
darryl
in
months
but
i
spent
enough
time
here
over
the
years
to
recognize
it
right
off
the
three
of
us
stood
around
the
car
for
a
long
moment
waiting
to
see
who
would
go
and
ring
the
doorbell
to
my
surprise
it
was
me
i
rang
it
and
we
all
waited
in
silence
for
a
minute
i
rang
it
again
darryl
father
car
was
in
the
driveway
and
we
seen
a
light
burning
in
the
living
room
i
was
about
to
ring
a
third
time
when
the
door
opened
marcus
darryl
father
was
anything
like
i
remembered
him
unshaven
in
a
housecoat
and
bare
feet
with
long
toenails
and
red
eyes
he
gained
weight
and
a
soft
extra
chin
wobbled
beneath
the
firm
military
jaw
his
thin
hair
was
wispy
and
disordered
mr
glover
i
said
my
parents
crowded
into
the
door
behind
me
hello
ron
my
mother
said
ron
my
father
said
you
too
what
going
on
can
we
come
in
his
living
room
looked
like
one
of
those
they
show
about
abandoned
kids
who
spend
a
month
locked
in
before
they
rescued
by
the
neighbors
frozen
meal
boxes
empty
beer
cans
and
juice
bottles
moldy
cereal
bowls
and
piles
of
newspapers
there
was
a
reek
of
cat
piss
and
litter
crunched
underneath
our
feet
even
without
the
cat
piss
the
smell
was
incredible
like
a
toilet
the
couch
was
made
up
with
a
grimy
sheet
and
a
couple
of
greasy
pillows
and
the
cushions
had
a
dented
look
we
all
stood
there
for
a
long
silent
moment
embarrassment
overwhelming
every
other
emotion
darryl
father
looked
like
he
wanted
to
die
slowly
he
moved
aside
the
sheets
from
the
sofa
and
cleared
the
stacked
greasy
off
of
a
couple
of
the
chairs
carrying
them
into
the
kitchen
and
from
the
sound
of
it
tossing
them
on
the
floor
we
sat
gingerly
in
the
places
he
cleared
and
then
he
came
back
and
sat
down
too
i
sorry
he
said
vaguely
i
do
really
have
any
coffee
to
offer
you
i
having
more
groceries
delivered
tomorrow
so
i
running
low
ron
my
father
said
listen
to
us
we
have
something
to
tell
you
and
it
not
going
to
be
easy
to
hear
he
sat
like
a
statue
as
i
talked
he
glanced
down
at
the
note
read
it
without
seeming
to
understand
it
then
read
it
again
he
handed
it
back
to
me
he
was
trembling
he
darryl
is
alive
i
said
darryl
is
alive
and
being
held
prisoner
on
treasure
island
he
stuffed
his
fist
in
his
mouth
and
made
a
horrible
groaning
sound
we
have
a
friend
my
father
said
she
writes
for
the
an
investigative
reporter
that
where
i
knew
the
name
from
the
free
weekly
often
lost
its
reporters
to
bigger
daily
papers
and
the
internet
but
barbara
stratford
had
been
there
forever
i
had
a
dim
memory
of
having
dinner
with
her
when
i
was
a
kid
we
going
there
now
my
mother
said
will
you
come
with
us
ron
will
you
tell
her
darryl
story
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
breathed
deeply
dad
tried
to
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulders
but
mr
glover
shook
it
off
violently
i
need
to
clean
myself
up
he
said
give
me
a
minute
mr
glover
came
back
downstairs
a
changed
man
he
shaved
and
gelled
his
hair
back
and
had
put
on
a
crisp
military
dress
uniform
with
a
row
of
campaign
ribbons
on
the
breast
he
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
kind
of
gestured
at
it
i
do
have
much
clean
stuff
that
presentable
at
the
moment
and
this
seemed
appropriate
you
know
if
she
wanted
to
take
pictures
he
and
dad
rode
up
front
and
i
got
in
the
back
behind
him
up
close
he
smelled
a
little
of
beer
like
it
was
coming
through
his
pores
it
was
midnight
by
the
time
we
rolled
into
barbara
stratford
driveway
she
lived
out
of
town
down
in
mountain
view
and
as
we
sped
down
the
none
of
us
said
a
word
the
buildings
alongside
the
highway
streamed
past
us
this
was
a
different
bay
area
to
the
one
i
lived
in
more
like
the
suburban
america
i
sometimes
saw
on
tv
lots
of
freeways
and
subdivisions
of
identical
houses
towns
where
there
were
any
homeless
people
pushing
shopping
carts
down
the
sidewalk
there
were
even
sidewalks
mom
had
phoned
barbara
stratford
while
we
were
waiting
for
mr
glover
to
come
downstairs
the
journalist
had
been
sleeping
but
mom
had
been
so
wound
up
she
forgot
to
be
all
british
and
embarrassed
about
waking
her
up
instead
she
just
told
her
tensely
that
she
had
something
to
talk
about
and
that
it
had
to
be
in
person
when
we
rolled
up
to
barbara
stratford
house
my
first
thought
was
of
the
brady
bunch
place
a
low
ranch
house
with
a
brick
baffle
in
front
of
it
and
a
neat
perfectly
square
lawn
there
was
a
kind
of
abstract
tile
pattern
on
the
baffle
and
an
uhf
tv
antenna
rising
from
behind
it
we
wandered
around
to
the
entrance
and
saw
that
there
were
lights
on
inside
already
the
writer
opened
the
door
before
we
had
a
chance
to
ring
the
bell
she
was
about
my
parents
age
a
tall
thin
woman
with
a
nose
and
shrewd
eyes
with
a
lot
of
she
was
wearing
a
pair
of
jeans
that
were
hip
enough
to
be
seen
at
one
of
the
boutiques
on
valencia
street
and
a
loose
indian
cotton
blouse
that
hung
down
to
her
thighs
she
had
small
round
glasses
that
flashed
in
her
hallway
light
she
smiled
a
tight
little
smile
at
us
you
brought
the
whole
clan
i
see
she
said
mom
nodded
you
understand
why
in
a
minute
she
said
mr
glover
stepped
from
behind
dad
and
you
called
in
the
navy
all
in
good
time
we
were
introduced
one
at
a
time
to
her
she
had
a
firm
handshake
and
long
fingers
her
place
was
furnished
in
japanese
minimalist
style
just
a
few
precisely
proportioned
low
pieces
of
furniture
large
clay
pots
of
bamboo
that
brushed
the
ceiling
and
what
looked
like
a
large
rusted
piece
of
a
diesel
engine
perched
on
top
of
a
polished
marble
plinth
i
decided
i
liked
it
the
floors
were
old
wood
sanded
and
stained
but
not
filled
so
you
could
see
cracks
and
pits
underneath
the
varnish
i
liked
that
especially
as
i
walked
over
it
in
my
stocking
feet
i
have
coffee
on
she
said
who
wants
some
we
all
put
up
our
hands
i
glared
defiantly
at
my
parents
right
she
said
she
disappeared
into
another
room
and
came
back
a
moment
later
bearing
a
rough
bamboo
tray
with
a
thermos
jug
and
six
cups
of
precise
design
but
with
rough
sloppy
decorations
i
liked
those
too
now
she
said
once
she
poured
and
served
it
very
good
to
see
you
all
again
marcus
i
think
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
were
maybe
seven
years
old
as
i
recall
you
were
very
excited
about
your
new
video
games
which
you
showed
me
i
did
remember
it
at
all
but
that
sounded
like
what
i
been
into
at
seven
i
guessed
it
was
my
sega
dreamcast
she
produced
a
and
a
yellow
pad
and
a
pen
and
twirled
the
pen
i
here
to
listen
to
whatever
you
tell
me
and
i
can
promise
you
that
i
take
it
all
in
confidence
but
i
ca
promise
that
i
do
anything
with
it
or
that
it
going
to
get
published
the
way
she
said
it
made
me
realize
that
my
mom
had
called
in
a
pretty
big
favor
getting
this
lady
out
of
bed
friend
or
no
friend
it
must
be
kind
of
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
be
a
investigative
reporter
there
were
probably
a
million
people
who
would
have
liked
her
to
take
up
their
cause
mom
nodded
at
me
even
though
i
told
the
story
three
times
that
night
i
found
myself
this
was
different
from
telling
my
parents
different
from
telling
darryl
father
this
this
would
start
a
new
move
in
the
game
i
started
slowly
and
watched
barbara
take
notes
i
drank
a
whole
cup
of
coffee
just
explaining
what
arging
was
and
how
i
got
out
of
school
to
play
mom
and
dad
and
mr
glover
all
listened
intently
to
this
part
i
poured
myself
another
cup
and
drank
it
on
the
way
to
explaining
how
we
were
taken
in
by
the
time
i
run
through
the
whole
story
i
drained
the
pot
and
i
needed
a
piss
like
a
her
bathroom
was
just
as
stark
as
the
with
a
brown
organic
soap
that
smelled
like
clean
mud
i
came
back
in
and
found
the
adults
quietly
watching
me
mr
glover
told
his
story
next
he
did
have
anything
to
say
about
what
had
happened
but
he
explained
that
he
was
a
veteran
and
that
his
son
was
a
good
kid
he
talked
about
what
it
felt
like
to
believe
that
his
son
had
died
about
how
his
had
had
a
collapse
when
she
found
out
and
ended
up
in
a
hospital
he
cried
a
little
unashamed
the
tears
streaming
down
his
lined
face
and
darkening
the
collar
of
his
when
it
was
all
done
barbara
went
into
a
different
room
and
came
back
with
a
bottle
of
irish
whiskey
it
a
bushmills
year
old
aged
blend
she
said
setting
down
four
small
cups
none
for
me
it
has
been
sold
in
ten
years
i
think
this
is
probably
an
appropriate
time
to
break
it
out
she
poured
them
each
a
small
glass
of
the
liquor
then
raised
hers
and
sipped
at
it
draining
half
the
glass
the
rest
of
the
adults
followed
suit
they
drank
again
and
finished
the
glasses
she
poured
them
new
shots
all
right
she
said
here
what
i
can
tell
you
right
now
i
believe
you
not
just
because
i
know
you
lillian
the
story
sounds
right
and
it
ties
in
with
other
rumors
i
heard
but
i
not
going
to
be
able
to
just
take
your
word
for
it
i
going
to
have
to
investigate
every
aspect
of
this
and
every
element
of
your
lives
and
stories
i
need
to
know
if
there
anything
you
not
telling
me
anything
that
could
be
used
to
discredit
you
after
this
comes
to
light
i
need
everything
it
could
take
weeks
before
i
ready
to
publish
you
also
need
to
think
about
your
safety
and
this
darryl
safety
if
he
really
an
then
bringing
pressure
to
bear
on
the
dhs
could
cause
them
to
move
him
somewhere
much
further
away
think
syria
they
could
also
do
something
much
worse
she
let
that
hang
in
the
air
i
knew
she
meant
that
they
might
kill
him
i
going
to
take
this
letter
and
scan
it
now
i
want
pictures
of
the
two
of
you
now
and
later
we
can
send
out
a
photographer
but
i
want
to
document
this
as
thoroughly
as
i
can
tonight
too
i
went
with
her
into
her
office
to
do
the
scan
i
expected
a
stylish
computer
that
fit
in
with
her
decor
but
instead
her
was
crammed
with
pcs
big
monitors
and
a
scanner
big
enough
to
lay
a
whole
sheet
of
newsprint
on
she
was
fast
with
it
all
too
i
noted
with
some
approval
that
she
was
running
paranoidlinux
this
lady
took
her
job
seriously
the
computers
fans
set
up
an
effective
shield
but
even
so
i
closed
the
door
and
moved
in
close
to
her
um
barbara
yes
about
what
you
said
about
what
might
be
used
to
discredit
me
yes
what
i
tell
you
you
ca
be
forced
to
tell
anyone
else
right
in
theory
let
me
put
it
this
way
i
gone
to
jail
twice
rather
than
rat
out
a
source
ok
good
wow
jail
wow
i
took
a
deep
breath
you
heard
of
xnet
of
yes
i
oh
she
said
she
worked
the
scanner
and
flipped
the
note
over
to
get
the
reverse
she
was
scanning
at
some
unbelievable
resolution
dots
per
inch
or
higher
and
it
was
like
the
output
of
an
microscope
well
that
does
put
a
different
complexion
on
this
yeah
i
said
i
guess
it
does
your
parents
do
know
nope
and
i
do
know
if
i
want
them
to
that
something
you
going
to
have
to
work
out
i
need
to
think
about
this
can
you
come
by
my
office
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
what
this
means
exactly
do
you
have
an
xbox
universal
i
could
bring
over
an
installer
yes
i
sure
that
can
be
arranged
when
you
come
by
tell
the
receptionist
that
you
mr
brown
to
see
me
they
know
what
that
means
no
note
will
be
taken
of
you
coming
and
all
the
security
camera
footage
for
the
day
will
be
automatically
scrubbed
and
the
cameras
deactivated
until
you
leave
wow
i
said
you
think
like
i
do
she
smiled
and
socked
me
in
the
shoulder
kiddo
i
been
at
this
game
for
a
hell
of
a
long
time
so
far
i
managed
to
spend
more
time
free
than
behind
bars
paranoia
is
my
friend
i
was
like
a
zombie
the
next
day
in
school
i
totaled
about
three
hours
of
sleep
and
even
three
cups
of
the
turk
caffeine
mud
failed
to
my
brain
the
problem
with
caffeine
is
that
it
too
easy
to
get
acclimated
to
it
so
you
have
to
take
higher
and
higher
doses
just
to
get
above
normal
i
spent
the
night
thinking
over
what
i
had
to
do
it
was
like
running
though
a
maze
of
twisty
little
passages
all
alike
every
one
leading
to
the
same
dead
end
when
i
went
to
barbara
it
would
be
over
for
me
that
was
the
outcome
no
matter
how
i
thought
about
it
by
the
time
the
school
day
was
over
all
i
wanted
was
to
go
home
and
crawl
into
bed
but
i
had
an
appointment
at
the
down
on
the
waterfront
i
kept
my
eyes
on
my
feet
as
i
wobbled
out
the
gate
and
as
i
turned
into
street
another
pair
of
feet
fell
into
step
with
me
i
recognized
the
shoes
and
stopped
ange
she
looked
like
i
felt
and
with
sad
brackets
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
hi
there
she
said
surprise
i
gave
myself
french
leave
from
school
i
could
concentrate
anyway
um
i
said
shut
up
and
give
me
a
hug
you
idiot
i
did
it
felt
good
better
than
good
it
felt
like
i
amputated
part
of
myself
and
it
had
been
reattached
i
love
you
marcus
yallow
i
love
you
angela
carvelli
ok
she
said
breaking
it
off
i
liked
your
post
about
why
you
not
jamming
i
can
respect
it
what
have
you
done
about
finding
a
way
to
jam
them
without
getting
caught
i
on
my
way
to
meet
an
investigative
journalist
who
going
to
publish
a
story
about
how
i
got
sent
to
jail
how
i
started
xnet
and
how
darryl
is
being
illegally
held
by
the
dhs
at
a
secret
prison
on
treasure
island
oh
she
looked
around
for
a
moment
could
you
think
of
anything
you
know
ambitious
want
to
come
i
am
coming
yes
and
i
would
like
you
to
explain
this
in
detail
if
you
do
mind
after
all
the
this
one
told
as
we
walked
to
potrero
avenue
and
down
to
street
was
the
easiest
she
held
my
hand
and
squeezed
it
often
we
took
the
stairs
up
to
the
offices
two
at
a
time
my
heart
was
pounding
i
got
to
the
reception
desk
and
told
the
bored
girl
behind
it
i
here
to
see
barbara
stratford
my
name
is
mr
green
i
think
you
mean
mr
brown
yeah
i
said
and
blushed
mr
brown
she
did
something
at
her
computer
then
said
have
a
seat
barbara
will
be
out
in
a
minute
can
i
get
you
anything
coffee
we
both
said
in
unison
another
reason
to
love
ange
we
were
addicted
to
the
same
drug
the
receptionist
a
pretty
latina
woman
only
a
few
years
older
than
us
dressed
in
gap
styles
so
old
they
were
actually
kind
of
nodded
and
stepped
out
and
came
back
with
a
couple
of
cups
bearing
the
newspaper
masthead
we
sipped
in
silence
watching
visitors
and
reporters
come
and
go
finally
barbara
came
to
get
us
she
was
wearing
practically
the
same
thing
as
the
night
before
it
suited
her
she
quirked
an
eyebrow
at
me
when
she
saw
that
i
brought
a
date
hello
i
said
um
this
is
ms
brown
ange
said
extending
a
hand
oh
yeah
right
our
identities
were
supposed
to
be
a
secret
i
work
with
mr
green
she
elbowed
me
lightly
let
go
then
barbara
said
and
led
us
back
to
a
with
long
glass
walls
with
their
blinds
drawn
shut
she
set
down
a
tray
of
whole
foods
organic
oreo
clones
a
digital
recorder
and
another
yellow
pad
do
you
want
to
record
this
too
she
asked
had
actually
thought
of
that
i
could
see
why
it
would
be
useful
if
i
wanted
to
dispute
what
barbara
printed
though
still
if
i
could
trust
her
to
do
right
by
me
i
was
doomed
anyway
no
that
ok
i
said
right
let
go
young
lady
my
name
is
barbara
stratford
and
i
an
investigative
reporter
i
gather
you
know
why
i
here
and
i
curious
to
know
why
you
here
i
work
with
marcus
on
the
xnet
she
said
do
you
need
to
know
my
name
not
right
now
i
do
barbara
said
you
can
be
anonymous
if
you
like
marcus
i
asked
you
to
tell
me
this
story
because
i
need
to
know
how
it
plays
with
the
story
you
told
me
about
your
friend
darryl
and
the
note
you
showed
me
i
can
see
how
it
would
be
a
good
adjunct
i
could
pitch
this
as
the
origin
of
the
xnet
made
an
enemy
they
never
forget
that
sort
of
thing
but
to
be
honest
i
rather
not
have
to
tell
that
story
if
i
do
have
to
i
rather
have
a
nice
clean
tale
about
the
secret
prison
on
our
doorstep
without
having
to
argue
about
whether
the
prisoners
there
are
the
sort
of
people
likely
to
walk
out
the
doors
and
establish
an
underground
movement
bent
on
destabilizing
the
federal
government
i
sure
you
can
understand
that
i
did
if
the
xnet
was
part
of
the
story
some
people
would
say
see
they
need
to
put
guys
like
that
in
jail
or
they
start
a
riot
this
is
your
show
i
said
i
think
you
need
to
tell
the
world
about
darryl
when
you
do
that
it
going
to
tell
the
dhs
that
i
gone
public
and
they
going
to
go
after
me
maybe
they
figure
out
then
that
i
involved
with
the
xnet
maybe
they
connect
me
to
i
guess
what
i
saying
is
once
you
publish
about
darryl
it
all
over
for
me
no
matter
what
i
made
my
peace
with
that
as
good
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
she
said
right
well
that
settled
i
want
the
two
of
you
to
tell
me
everything
you
can
about
the
founding
and
operation
of
the
xnet
and
then
i
want
a
demonstration
what
do
you
use
it
for
who
else
uses
it
how
did
it
spread
who
wrote
the
software
everything
this
take
a
while
ange
said
i
got
a
while
barbara
said
she
drank
some
coffee
and
ate
a
fake
oreo
this
could
be
the
most
important
story
of
the
war
on
terror
this
could
be
the
story
that
topples
the
government
when
you
have
a
story
like
this
you
take
it
very
carefully
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
waterstone
the
national
uk
bookselling
chain
waterstone
is
a
chain
of
stores
but
each
one
has
the
feel
of
a
great
independent
store
with
tons
of
personality
great
stock
especially
audiobooks
and
knowledgeable
staff

http
so
we
told
her
i
found
it
really
fun
actually
teaching
people
how
to
use
technology
is
always
exciting
it
so
cool
to
watch
people
figure
out
how
the
technology
around
them
can
be
used
to
make
their
lives
better
ange
was
great
too
we
made
an
excellent
team
we
trade
off
explaining
how
it
all
worked
barbara
was
pretty
good
at
this
stuff
to
begin
with
of
course
it
turned
out
that
she
covered
the
crypto
wars
the
period
in
the
early
nineties
when
civil
liberties
groups
like
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
fought
for
the
right
of
americans
to
use
strong
crypto
i
dimly
knew
about
that
period
but
barbara
explained
it
in
a
way
that
made
me
get
it
unbelievable
today
but
there
was
a
time
when
the
government
classed
crypto
as
a
munition
and
made
it
illegal
for
anyone
to
export
or
use
it
on
national
security
grounds
get
that
we
used
to
have
illegal
in
this
country
the
national
security
agency
were
the
real
movers
behind
the
ban
they
had
a
crypto
standard
that
they
said
was
strong
enough
for
bankers
and
their
customers
to
use
but
not
so
strong
that
the
mafia
would
be
able
to
keep
its
books
secret
from
them
the
standard
was
said
to
be
practically
unbreakable
then
one
of
eff
millionaire
built
a
cracker
that
could
break
the
cipher
in
two
hours
still
the
nsa
argued
that
it
should
be
able
to
keep
american
citizens
from
possessing
secrets
it
could
pry
into
then
eff
dealt
its
in
they
represented
a
berkeley
mathematics
grad
student
called
dan
bernstein
in
court
bernstein
had
written
a
crypto
tutorial
that
contained
computer
code
that
could
be
used
to
make
a
cipher
stronger
than
millions
of
times
stronger
as
far
as
the
nsa
was
concerned
that
made
his
article
into
a
weapon
and
therefore
unpublishable
well
it
may
be
hard
to
get
a
judge
to
understand
crypto
and
what
it
means
but
it
turned
out
that
the
average
appeals
court
judge
is
real
enthusiastic
about
telling
grad
students
what
kind
of
articles
they
allowed
to
write
the
crypto
wars
ended
with
a
victory
for
the
good
guys
when
the
circuit
appellate
division
court
ruled
that
code
was
a
form
of
expression
protected
under
the
first
amendment
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
if
you
ever
bought
something
on
the
internet
or
sent
a
secret
message
or
checked
your
you
used
crypto
that
eff
legalized
good
thing
too
the
nsa
just
is
that
smart
anything
they
know
how
to
crack
you
can
be
sure
that
terrorists
and
mobsters
can
get
around
too
barbara
had
been
one
of
the
reporters
who
made
her
reputation
from
covering
the
issue
she
cut
her
teeth
covering
the
tail
end
of
the
civil
rights
movement
in
san
francisco
and
she
recognized
the
similarity
between
the
fight
for
the
constitution
in
the
real
world
and
the
fight
in
cyberspace
so
she
got
it
i
do
think
i
could
have
explained
this
stuff
to
my
parents
but
with
barbara
it
was
easy
she
asked
smart
questions
about
our
cryptographic
protocols
and
security
procedures
sometimes
asking
stuff
i
did
know
the
answer
to
sometimes
pointing
out
potential
breaks
in
our
procedure
we
plugged
in
the
xbox
and
got
it
online
there
were
four
open
wifi
nodes
visible
from
the
board
room
and
i
told
it
to
change
between
them
at
random
intervals
she
got
this
too
once
you
were
actually
plugged
into
the
xnet
it
was
just
like
being
on
the
internet
only
some
stuff
was
a
little
slower
and
it
was
all
anonymous
and
unsniffable
so
now
what
i
said
as
we
wound
down
i
talked
myself
dry
and
i
had
a
terrible
acid
feeling
from
the
coffee
besides
ange
kept
squeezing
my
hand
under
the
table
in
a
way
that
made
me
want
to
break
away
and
find
somewhere
private
to
finish
making
up
for
our
first
fight
now
i
do
journalism
you
go
away
and
i
research
all
the
things
you
told
me
and
try
to
confirm
them
to
the
extent
that
i
can
i
let
you
see
what
i
going
to
publish
and
i
let
you
know
when
it
going
to
go
live
i
prefer
that
you
talk
about
this
with
anyone
else
now
because
i
want
the
scoop
and
because
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
get
the
story
before
it
goes
all
muddy
from
press
speculation
and
dhs
spin
i
have
to
call
the
dhs
for
comment
before
i
go
to
press
but
i
do
that
in
a
way
that
protects
you
to
whatever
extent
possible
i
also
be
sure
to
let
you
know
before
that
happens
one
thing
i
need
to
be
clear
on
this
is
your
story
anymore
it
mine
you
were
very
generous
to
give
it
to
me
and
i
try
to
repay
the
gift
but
you
do
get
the
right
to
edit
anything
out
to
change
it
or
to
stop
me
this
is
now
in
motion
and
it
wo
stop
do
you
understand
that
i
had
thought
about
it
in
those
terms
but
once
she
said
it
it
was
obvious
it
meant
that
i
had
launched
and
i
would
be
able
to
recall
the
rocket
it
was
going
to
fall
where
it
was
aimed
or
it
would
go
off
course
but
it
was
in
the
air
and
could
be
changed
now
sometime
in
the
near
future
i
would
stop
being
marcus
i
would
be
a
public
figure
i
be
the
guy
who
blew
the
whistle
on
the
dhs
i
be
a
dead
man
walking
i
guess
ange
was
thinking
along
the
same
lines
because
she
gone
a
color
between
white
and
green
let
get
out
of
here
she
said
ange
mom
and
sister
were
out
again
which
made
it
easy
to
decide
where
we
were
going
for
the
evening
it
was
past
supper
time
but
my
parents
had
known
that
i
was
meeting
with
barbara
and
would
give
me
any
grief
if
i
came
home
late
when
we
got
to
ange
i
had
no
urge
to
plug
in
my
xbox
i
had
had
all
the
xnet
i
could
handle
for
one
day
all
i
could
think
about
was
ange
ange
ange
living
without
ange
knowing
ange
was
angry
with
me
ange
never
going
to
talk
to
me
again
ange
never
going
to
kiss
me
again
she
been
thinking
the
same
i
could
see
it
in
her
eyes
as
we
shut
the
door
to
her
bedroom
and
looked
at
each
other
i
was
hungry
for
her
like
you
hunger
for
dinner
after
not
eating
for
days
like
you
thirst
for
a
glass
of
water
after
playing
soccer
for
three
hours
straight
like
none
of
that
it
was
more
it
was
something
i
never
felt
before
i
wanted
to
eat
her
whole
devour
her
up
until
now
she
been
the
sexual
one
in
our
relationship
i
let
her
set
and
control
the
pace
it
was
amazingly
erotic
to
have
grab
and
take
off
my
shirt
drag
my
face
to
hers
but
tonight
i
could
hold
back
i
would
hold
back
the
door
clicked
shut
and
i
reached
for
the
hem
of
her
and
yanked
barely
giving
her
time
to
lift
her
arms
as
i
pulled
it
over
her
head
i
tore
my
own
shirt
over
my
head
listening
to
the
cotton
crackle
as
the
stitches
came
loose
her
eyes
were
shining
her
mouth
open
her
breathing
fast
and
shallow
mine
was
too
my
breath
and
my
heart
and
my
blood
all
roaring
in
my
ears
i
took
off
the
rest
of
our
clothes
with
equal
zest
throwing
them
into
the
piles
of
dirty
and
clean
laundry
on
the
floor
there
were
books
and
papers
all
over
the
bed
and
i
swept
them
aside
we
landed
on
the
unmade
bedclothes
a
second
later
arms
around
one
another
squeezing
like
we
would
pull
ourselves
right
through
one
another
she
moaned
into
my
mouth
and
i
made
the
sound
back
and
i
felt
her
voice
buzz
in
my
vocal
chords
a
feeling
more
intimate
than
anything
i
ever
felt
before
she
broke
away
and
reached
for
the
bedstand
she
yanked
open
the
drawer
and
threw
a
white
pharmacy
bag
on
the
bed
before
me
i
looked
inside
condoms
trojans
one
dozen
spermicidal
still
sealed
i
smiled
at
her
and
she
smiled
back
and
i
opened
the
box
i
thought
about
what
it
would
be
like
for
years
a
hundred
times
a
day
i
imagined
it
some
days
i
thought
of
practically
nothing
else
it
was
nothing
like
i
expected
parts
of
it
were
better
parts
of
it
were
lots
worse
while
it
was
going
on
it
felt
like
an
eternity
afterwards
it
seemed
to
be
over
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
afterwards
i
felt
the
same
but
i
also
felt
different
something
had
changed
between
us
it
was
weird
we
were
both
shy
as
we
put
our
clothes
on
and
puttered
around
the
room
looking
away
not
meeting
each
other
eyes
i
wrapped
the
condom
in
a
kleenex
from
a
box
beside
the
bed
and
took
it
into
the
bathroom
and
wound
it
with
toilet
paper
and
stuck
it
deep
into
the
when
i
came
back
in
ange
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
playing
with
her
xbox
i
sat
down
carefully
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
she
turned
to
face
me
and
smiled
we
were
both
worn
out
trembly
thanks
i
said
she
did
say
anything
she
turned
her
face
to
me
she
was
grinning
hugely
but
fat
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
i
hugged
her
and
she
grabbed
tightly
onto
me
you
a
good
man
marcus
yallow
she
whispered
thank
you
i
did
know
what
to
say
but
i
squeezed
her
back
finally
we
parted
she
was
crying
any
more
but
she
was
still
smiling
she
pointed
at
my
xbox
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
i
took
the
hint
i
picked
it
up
and
plugged
it
in
and
logged
in
same
old
same
old
lots
of
email
the
new
posts
on
the
blogs
i
read
streamed
in
spam
god
did
i
get
a
lot
of
spam
my
swedish
mailbox
was
repeatedly
used
as
the
return
address
for
spams
sent
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
internet
accounts
so
that
all
the
bounces
and
angry
messages
came
back
to
me
i
did
know
who
was
behind
it
maybe
the
dhs
trying
to
overwhelm
my
mailbox
maybe
it
was
just
people
pranking
the
pirate
party
had
pretty
good
filters
though
and
they
gave
anyone
who
wanted
it
gigabytes
of
email
storage
so
i
was
likely
to
be
drowned
any
time
soon
i
filtered
it
all
out
hammering
on
the
delete
key
i
had
a
separate
mailbox
for
stuff
that
came
in
encrypted
to
my
public
key
since
that
was
likely
to
be
and
possibly
sensitive
spammers
had
figured
out
that
using
public
keys
would
make
their
junk
mail
more
plausible
yet
so
for
now
this
worked
well
there
were
a
couple
dozen
encrypted
messages
from
people
in
the
web
of
trust
i
skimmed
them
links
to
videos
and
pics
of
new
abuses
from
the
dhs
horror
stories
about
rants
about
stuff
i
blogged
the
usual
then
i
came
to
one
that
was
only
encrypted
to
my
public
key
that
meant
that
no
one
else
could
read
it
but
i
had
no
idea
who
had
written
it
it
said
it
came
from
masha
which
could
either
be
a
handle
or
a
name
i
could
tell
which
you
do
know
me
but
i
know
you
i
was
arrested
the
day
that
the
bridge
blew
they
questioned
me
they
decided
i
was
innocent
they
offered
me
a
job
help
them
hunt
down
the
terrorists
who
killed
my
neighbors
it
sounded
like
a
good
deal
at
the
time
little
did
i
realize
that
my
actual
job
would
turn
out
to
be
spying
on
kids
who
resented
their
city
being
turned
into
a
police
state
i
infiltrated
xnet
on
the
day
it
launched
i
am
in
your
web
of
trust
if
i
wanted
to
spill
my
identity
i
could
send
you
email
from
an
address
you
trust
three
addresses
actually
i
totally
inside
your
network
as
only
another
can
be
some
of
the
email
you
gotten
has
been
carefully
chosen
misinformation
from
me
and
my
handlers
they
do
know
who
you
are
but
they
coming
close
they
continue
to
turn
people
to
compromise
them
they
mine
the
social
network
sites
and
use
threats
to
turn
kids
into
informants
there
are
hundreds
of
people
working
for
the
dhs
on
xnet
right
now
i
have
their
names
handles
and
keys
private
and
public
within
days
of
the
xnet
launch
we
went
to
work
on
exploiting
paranoidlinux
the
exploits
so
far
have
been
small
and
insubstantial
but
a
break
is
inevitable
once
we
have
a
break
you
dead
i
think
it
safe
to
say
that
if
my
handlers
knew
that
i
was
typing
this
my
ass
would
be
stuck
in
until
i
was
an
old
woman
even
if
they
do
break
paranoidlinux
there
are
poisoned
paranoidxbox
distros
floating
around
they
do
match
the
checksums
but
how
many
people
look
at
the
checksums
besides
me
and
you
plenty
of
kids
are
already
dead
though
they
do
know
it
all
that
remains
is
for
my
handlers
to
figure
out
the
best
time
to
bust
you
to
make
the
biggest
impact
in
the
media
that
time
will
be
sooner
not
later
believe
you
probably
wondering
why
i
telling
you
this
i
am
too
here
where
i
come
from
i
signed
up
to
fight
terrorists
instead
i
spying
on
americans
who
believe
things
that
the
dhs
does
like
not
people
who
plan
on
blowing
up
bridges
but
protestors
i
ca
do
it
anymore
but
neither
can
you
whether
or
not
you
know
it
like
i
say
it
only
a
matter
of
time
until
you
in
chains
on
treasure
island
that
not
if
that
when
so
i
through
here
down
in
los
angeles
there
are
some
people
they
say
they
can
keep
me
safe
if
i
want
to
get
out
i
want
to
get
out
i
will
take
you
with
me
if
you
want
to
come
better
to
be
a
fighter
than
a
martyr
if
you
come
with
me
we
can
figure
out
how
to
win
together
i
as
smart
as
you
believe
what
do
you
say
here
my
public
key
masha
when
in
trouble
or
in
doubt
run
in
circles
scream
and
shout
ever
hear
that
rhyme
it
not
good
advice
but
at
least
it
easy
to
follow
i
leapt
off
the
bed
and
paced
back
and
forth
my
heart
thudded
and
my
blood
sang
in
a
cruel
parody
of
the
way
i
felt
when
we
got
home
this
was
sexual
excitement
it
was
raw
terror
what
ange
said
what
i
pointed
at
the
screen
on
my
side
of
the
bed
she
rolled
over
and
grabbed
my
keyboard
and
scribed
on
the
touchpad
with
her
fingertip
she
read
in
silence
i
paced
this
has
to
be
lies
she
said
the
dhs
is
playing
games
with
your
head
i
looked
at
her
she
was
biting
her
lip
she
did
look
like
she
believed
it
you
think
sure
they
ca
beat
you
so
they
coming
after
you
using
xnet
yeah
i
sat
back
down
on
the
bed
i
was
breathing
fast
again
chill
out
she
said
it
just
here
she
never
took
my
keyboard
from
me
before
but
now
there
was
a
new
intimacy
between
us
she
hit
reply
and
typed
nice
try
she
was
writing
as
now
too
we
were
together
in
a
way
that
was
different
from
before
go
ahead
and
sign
it
we
see
what
she
says
i
did
know
if
that
was
the
best
idea
but
i
did
have
any
better
ones
i
signed
it
and
encrypted
it
with
my
private
key
and
the
public
key
masha
had
provided
the
reply
was
instant
i
thought
you
say
something
like
that
here
a
hack
you
have
thought
of
i
can
anonymously
tunnel
video
over
dns
here
are
some
links
to
clips
you
might
want
to
look
at
before
you
decide
i
full
of
it
these
people
are
all
recording
each
other
all
the
time
as
insurance
against
a
it
pretty
easy
to
snoop
off
them
as
they
snoop
on
each
other
masha
attached
was
for
a
little
program
that
appeared
to
do
exactly
what
masha
claimed
pull
video
over
the
domain
name
service
protocol
let
me
back
up
a
moment
here
and
explain
something
at
the
end
of
the
day
every
internet
protocol
is
just
a
sequence
of
text
sent
back
and
forth
in
a
prescribed
order
it
kind
of
like
getting
a
truck
and
putting
a
car
in
it
then
putting
a
motorcycle
in
the
car
trunk
then
attaching
a
bicycle
to
the
back
of
the
motorcycle
then
hanging
a
pair
of
rollerblades
on
the
back
of
the
bike
except
that
then
if
you
want
you
can
attach
the
truck
to
the
rollerblades
for
example
take
simple
mail
transport
protocol
or
smtp
which
is
used
for
sending
email
here
a
sample
conversation
between
me
and
my
mail
server
sending
a
message
to
myself
helo
hello
pleased
to
meet
you
mail
from
sender
ok
rcpt
to
recipient
ok
data
enter
mail
end
with
on
a
line
by
itself
when
in
trouble
or
in
doubt
run
in
circles
scream
and
shout
message
accepted
for
delivery
quit
closing
connection
connection
closed
by
foreign
host
this
conversation
grammar
was
defined
in
by
jon
postel
one
of
the
internet
heroic
forefathers
who
used
to
literally
run
the
most
important
servers
on
the
net
under
his
desk
at
the
university
of
southern
california
back
in
the
paleolithic
era
now
imagine
that
you
hooked
up
a
to
an
im
session
you
could
send
an
im
to
the
server
that
said
helo
and
it
would
reply
with
hello
pleased
to
meet
you
in
other
words
you
could
have
the
same
conversation
over
im
as
you
do
over
smtp
with
the
right
tweaks
the
whole
business
could
take
place
inside
of
a
chat
or
a
or
anything
else
this
is
called
tunneling
you
put
the
smtp
inside
a
chat
tunnel
you
could
then
put
the
chat
back
into
an
smtp
tunnel
if
you
wanted
to
be
really
weird
tunneling
the
tunnel
in
another
tunnel
in
fact
every
internet
protocol
is
susceptible
to
this
process
it
cool
because
it
means
that
if
you
on
a
network
with
only
web
access
you
can
tunnel
your
mail
over
it
you
can
tunnel
your
favorite
over
it
you
can
even
tunnel
xnet
which
itself
is
a
tunnel
for
dozens
of
protocols
over
it
domain
name
service
is
an
interesting
and
ancient
internet
protocol
dating
back
to
it
the
way
that
your
computer
converts
a
computer
name
like
to
the
ip
number
that
computers
actually
use
to
talk
to
each
other
over
the
net
like
it
generally
works
like
magic
even
though
it
got
millions
of
moving
parts
every
isp
runs
a
dns
server
as
do
most
governments
and
lots
of
private
operators
these
dns
boxes
all
talk
to
each
other
all
the
time
making
and
filling
requests
to
each
other
so
no
matter
how
obscure
the
name
is
you
feed
to
your
computer
it
will
be
able
to
turn
it
into
a
number
before
dns
there
was
the
hosts
file
believe
it
or
not
this
was
a
single
document
that
listed
the
name
and
address
of
single
connected
to
the
internet
every
computer
had
a
copy
of
it
this
file
was
eventually
too
big
to
move
around
so
dns
was
invented
and
ran
on
a
server
that
used
to
live
under
jon
postel
desk
if
the
cleaners
knocked
out
the
plug
the
entire
internet
lost
its
ability
to
find
itself
seriously
the
thing
about
dns
today
is
that
it
everywhere
every
network
has
a
dns
server
living
on
it
and
all
of
those
servers
are
configured
to
talk
to
each
other
and
to
random
people
all
over
the
internet
what
masha
had
done
was
figure
out
a
way
to
tunnel
a
system
over
dns
she
was
breaking
up
the
video
into
billions
of
pieces
and
hiding
each
of
them
in
a
normal
message
to
a
dns
server
by
running
her
code
i
was
able
to
pull
the
video
from
all
those
dns
servers
all
over
the
internet
at
incredible
speed
it
must
have
looked
bizarre
on
the
network
histograms
like
i
was
looking
up
the
address
of
every
computer
in
the
world
but
it
had
two
advantages
i
appreciated
at
once
i
was
able
to
get
the
video
with
blinding
speed
as
soon
as
i
clicked
the
first
link
i
started
to
receive
pictures
without
any
jitter
or
stuttering
and
i
had
no
idea
where
it
was
hosted
it
was
totally
anonymous
at
first
i
did
even
clock
the
content
of
the
video
i
was
totally
floored
by
the
cleverness
of
this
hack
streaming
video
from
dns
that
was
so
smart
and
weird
it
was
practically
gradually
what
i
was
seeing
began
to
sink
in
it
was
a
table
in
a
small
room
with
a
mirror
down
one
wall
i
knew
that
room
i
sat
in
that
room
while
woman
had
made
me
speak
my
password
aloud
there
were
five
comfortable
chairs
around
the
table
each
with
a
comfortable
person
all
in
dhs
uniform
i
recognized
major
general
graeme
sutherland
the
dhs
bay
area
commander
along
with
severe
haircut
the
others
were
new
to
me
they
all
watched
a
video
screen
at
the
end
of
the
table
on
which
there
was
an
infinitely
more
familiar
face
kurt
rooney
was
known
nationally
as
the
president
chief
strategist
the
man
who
returned
the
party
for
its
third
term
and
who
was
steaming
towards
a
fourth
they
called
him
ruthless
and
i
seen
a
news
report
once
about
how
tight
a
rein
he
kept
his
staffers
on
calling
them
iming
them
watching
their
every
motion
controlling
every
step
he
was
old
with
a
lined
face
and
pale
gray
eyes
and
a
flat
nose
with
broad
flared
nostrils
and
thin
lips
a
man
who
looked
like
he
was
smelling
something
bad
all
the
time
he
was
the
man
on
the
screen
he
was
talking
and
everyone
else
was
focused
on
his
screen
everyone
taking
notes
as
fast
as
they
could
type
trying
to
look
say
that
they
angry
with
authority
but
we
need
to
show
the
country
that
it
terrorists
not
the
government
that
they
need
to
blame
do
you
understand
me
the
nation
does
not
love
that
city
as
far
as
they
concerned
it
is
a
sodom
and
gomorrah
of
fags
and
atheists
who
deserve
to
rot
in
hell
the
only
reason
the
country
cares
what
they
think
in
san
francisco
is
that
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
been
blown
to
hell
by
some
islamic
terrorists
these
xnet
children
are
getting
to
the
point
where
they
might
start
to
be
useful
to
us
the
more
radical
they
get
the
more
the
rest
of
the
nation
understands
that
there
are
threats
everywhere
his
audience
finished
typing
we
can
control
that
i
think
severe
haircut
lady
said
our
people
in
the
xnet
have
built
up
a
lot
of
influence
the
manchurian
bloggers
are
running
as
many
as
fifty
blogs
each
flooding
the
chat
channels
linking
to
each
other
mostly
just
taking
the
party
line
set
by
this
but
they
already
shown
that
they
can
provoke
radical
action
even
when
is
putting
the
brakes
on
major
general
sutherland
nodded
we
have
been
planning
to
leave
them
underground
until
about
a
month
before
the
midterms
i
guessed
that
meant
the
elections
not
my
exams
that
per
the
original
plan
but
it
sounds
like
we
got
another
plan
for
the
midterms
rooney
said
of
course
but
you
should
all
probably
not
plan
on
traveling
for
the
month
before
cut
the
xnet
loose
now
as
soon
as
you
can
so
long
as
they
moderates
they
a
liability
keep
them
radical
the
video
cut
off
ange
and
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
looking
at
the
screen
ange
reached
out
and
started
the
video
again
we
watched
it
it
was
worse
the
second
time
i
tossed
the
keyboard
aside
and
got
up
i
am
of
being
scared
i
said
let
take
this
to
barbara
and
have
her
publish
it
all
put
it
all
on
the
net
let
them
take
me
away
at
least
i
know
what
going
to
happen
then
at
least
then
i
have
a
little
in
my
life
ange
grabbed
me
and
hugged
me
soothed
me
i
know
baby
i
know
it
all
terrible
but
you
focusing
on
the
bad
stuff
and
ignoring
the
good
stuff
you
created
a
movement
you
outflanked
the
jerks
in
the
white
house
the
crooks
in
dhs
uniforms
you
put
yourself
in
a
position
where
you
could
be
responsible
for
blowing
the
lid
off
of
the
entire
rotten
dhs
thing
sure
they
out
to
get
you
course
they
are
have
you
ever
doubted
it
for
a
moment
i
always
figured
they
were
but
marcus
do
know
who
you
think
about
that
all
those
people
money
guns
and
spies
and
you
a
seventeen
year
old
high
school
kid
you
still
beating
them
they
do
know
about
barbara
they
do
know
about
zeb
you
jammed
them
in
the
streets
of
san
francisco
and
humiliated
them
before
the
world
so
stop
moping
all
right
you
winning
they
coming
for
me
though
you
see
that
they
going
to
put
me
in
jail
forever
not
even
jail
i
just
disappear
like
darryl
maybe
worse
maybe
syria
why
leave
me
in
san
francisco
i
a
liability
as
long
as
i
in
the
usa
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
with
me
yeah
she
said
that
that
well
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
right
what
she
looked
pointedly
at
my
keyboard
i
could
see
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
no
you
out
of
your
mind
you
think
i
going
to
run
off
with
some
nut
off
the
internet
some
spy
you
got
a
better
idea
i
kicked
a
pile
of
her
laundry
into
the
air
whatever
fine
i
talk
to
her
some
more
you
talk
to
her
ange
said
you
tell
her
you
and
your
girlfriend
are
getting
out
what
shut
up
dickhead
you
think
you
in
danger
i
in
just
as
much
danger
marcus
it
called
guilt
by
association
when
you
go
i
go
she
had
her
jaw
thrust
out
at
a
mutinous
angle
you
and
i
we
together
now
you
have
to
understand
that
we
sat
down
on
the
bed
together
unless
you
do
want
me
she
said
finally
in
a
small
voice
you
kidding
me
right
do
i
look
like
i
kidding
there
no
way
i
would
voluntarily
go
without
you
ange
i
could
never
have
asked
you
to
come
but
i
ecstatic
that
you
offered
she
smiled
and
tossed
me
my
keyboard
email
this
masha
creature
let
see
what
this
chick
can
do
for
us
i
emailed
her
encrypting
the
message
waiting
for
a
reply
ange
nuzzled
me
a
little
and
i
kissed
her
and
we
necked
something
about
the
danger
and
the
pact
to
go
together
it
made
me
forget
the
awkwardness
of
having
sex
made
me
freaking
horny
as
hell
we
were
half
naked
again
when
masha
email
arrived
two
of
you
jesus
like
it
wo
be
hard
enough
already
i
do
get
to
leave
except
to
do
field
intelligence
after
a
big
xnet
hit
you
get
me
the
handlers
watch
my
every
move
but
i
go
off
the
leash
when
something
big
happens
with
xnetters
i
get
sent
into
the
field
then
you
do
something
big
i
get
sent
to
it
i
get
us
both
out
all
three
of
us
if
you
insist
make
it
fast
though
i
ca
send
you
a
lot
of
email
understand
they
watch
me
they
closing
in
on
you
you
do
have
a
lot
of
time
weeks
maybe
just
days
i
need
you
to
get
me
out
that
why
i
doing
this
in
case
you
wondering
i
ca
escape
on
my
own
i
need
a
big
xnet
distraction
that
your
department
do
fail
me
or
we
both
dead
your
girlie
too
masha
my
phone
rang
making
us
both
jump
it
was
my
mom
wanting
to
know
when
i
was
coming
home
i
told
her
i
was
on
my
way
she
did
mention
barbara
we
agreed
that
we
would
talk
about
any
of
this
stuff
on
the
phone
that
was
my
dad
idea
he
could
be
as
paranoid
as
me
i
have
to
go
i
said
our
parents
will
be
i
know
i
said
i
saw
what
happened
to
my
parents
when
they
thought
i
was
dead
knowing
that
i
a
fugitive
is
going
to
be
much
better
but
they
rather
i
be
a
fugitive
than
a
prisoner
that
what
i
think
anyway
once
we
disappear
barbara
can
publish
without
worrying
about
getting
us
into
trouble
we
kissed
at
the
door
of
her
room
not
one
of
the
hot
sloppy
numbers
we
usually
did
when
parting
ways
a
sweet
kiss
this
time
a
slow
kiss
a
goodbye
kind
of
kiss
bart
rides
are
introspective
when
the
train
rocks
back
and
forth
and
you
try
not
to
make
eye
contact
with
the
other
riders
and
you
try
not
to
read
the
ads
for
plastic
surgery
bail
bondsmen
and
aids
testing
when
you
try
to
ignore
the
graffiti
and
not
look
too
closely
at
the
stuff
in
the
carpeting
that
when
your
mind
starts
to
really
churn
and
churn
you
rock
back
and
forth
and
your
mind
goes
over
all
the
things
you
overlooked
plays
back
all
the
movies
of
your
life
where
you
no
hero
where
you
a
chump
or
a
sucker
your
brain
comes
up
with
theories
like
this
one
the
dhs
wanted
to
catch
what
better
way
than
to
lure
him
into
the
open
panic
him
into
leading
some
kind
of
big
public
xnet
event
would
that
be
worth
the
chance
of
a
compromising
video
leaking
your
brain
comes
up
with
stuff
like
that
even
when
the
train
ride
only
lasts
two
or
three
stops
when
you
get
off
and
you
start
moving
the
blood
gets
running
and
sometimes
your
brain
helps
you
out
again
sometimes
your
brain
gives
you
solutions
in
addition
to
problems

and
the
sophia
folks
emailed
me
in
advance
to
ask
me
to
drop
in
and
sign
their
stock
while
i
was
in
the
neighborhood
when
i
got
there
i
discovered
a
of
works
in
a
dizzying
array
of
languages
from
graphic
novels
to
thick
academic
treatises
presided
over
by
even
slapstick
staff
who
so
palpably
enjoyed
their
jobs
that
it
spread
to
every
customer
who
stepped
through
the
door

there
was
a
time
when
my
favorite
thing
in
the
world
was
putting
on
a
cape
and
hanging
out
in
hotels
pretending
to
be
an
invisible
vampire
whom
everyone
stared
at
it
complicated
and
not
nearly
as
weird
as
it
sounds
the
live
action
role
playing
scene
combines
the
best
aspects
of
d
d
with
drama
club
with
going
to
cons
i
understand
that
this
might
not
make
it
sound
as
appealing
to
you
as
it
was
to
me
when
i
was
the
best
games
were
the
ones
at
the
scout
camps
out
of
town
a
hundred
teenagers
boys
and
girls
fighting
the
friday
night
traffic
swapping
stories
playing
handheld
games
showing
off
for
hours
then
debarking
to
stand
in
the
grass
before
a
group
of
older
men
and
women
in
armor
dented
and
scarred
like
armor
must
have
been
in
the
old
days
not
like
it
portrayed
in
the
movies
but
like
a
soldier
uniform
after
a
month
in
the
bush
these
people
were
nominally
paid
to
run
the
games
but
you
did
get
the
job
unless
you
were
the
kind
of
person
who
do
it
for
free
they
have
already
divided
us
into
teams
based
on
the
questionnaires
we
filled
in
beforehand
and
we
get
our
team
assignments
then
like
being
called
up
for
baseball
sides
then
you
get
your
briefing
packages
these
were
like
the
briefings
the
spies
get
in
the
movies
here
your
identity
here
your
mission
here
the
secrets
you
know
about
the
group
from
there
it
was
time
for
dinner
roaring
fires
meat
popping
on
spits
tofu
sizzling
on
skillets
it
northern
california
a
vegetarian
option
is
not
optional
and
a
style
of
eating
and
drinking
that
can
only
be
described
as
quaffing
already
the
keen
kids
would
be
getting
into
character
my
first
game
i
was
a
wizard
i
had
a
bag
of
beanbags
that
represented
spells
when
i
threw
one
i
would
shout
the
name
of
the
spell
i
was
casting
fireball
magic
missile
cone
of
light
and
the
player
or
monster
i
threw
it
at
would
keel
over
if
i
connected
or
not
sometimes
we
had
to
call
in
a
ref
to
mediate
but
for
the
most
part
we
were
all
pretty
good
about
playing
fair
no
one
liked
a
dice
lawyer
by
bedtime
we
were
all
in
character
at
i
was
what
a
wizard
was
supposed
to
sound
like
but
i
could
take
my
cues
from
the
movies
and
novels
i
spoke
in
slow
measured
tones
keeping
my
face
composed
in
a
suitably
mystical
expression
and
thinking
mystical
thoughts
the
mission
was
complicated
retrieving
a
sacred
relic
that
had
been
stolen
by
an
ogre
who
was
bent
on
subjugating
the
people
of
the
land
to
his
will
it
did
really
matter
a
whole
lot
what
mattered
was
that
i
had
a
private
mission
to
capture
a
certain
kind
of
imp
to
serve
as
my
familiar
and
that
i
had
a
secret
nemesis
another
player
on
the
team
who
had
taken
part
in
a
raid
that
killed
my
family
when
i
was
a
boy
a
player
who
did
know
that
i
come
back
bent
on
revenge
somewhere
of
course
there
was
another
player
with
a
similar
grudge
against
me
so
that
even
as
i
was
enjoying
the
camaraderie
of
the
team
i
always
have
to
keep
an
eye
open
for
a
knife
in
the
back
poison
in
the
food
for
the
next
two
days
we
played
it
out
there
were
parts
of
the
weekend
that
were
like
some
that
were
like
wilderness
survival
exercises
some
that
were
like
solving
crossword
puzzles
the
had
done
a
great
job
and
you
really
got
to
be
friends
with
the
other
people
on
the
mission
darryl
was
the
target
of
my
first
murder
and
i
put
my
back
into
it
even
though
he
was
my
pal
nice
guy
shame
i
have
to
kill
him
i
fireballed
him
as
he
was
seeking
out
treasure
after
we
wiped
out
a
band
of
orcs
playing
with
each
orc
to
determine
who
would
prevail
in
combat
this
is
a
lot
more
exciting
than
it
sounds
it
was
like
summer
camp
for
drama
geeks
we
talked
until
late
at
night
in
tents
looked
at
the
stars
jumped
in
the
river
when
we
got
hot
slapped
away
mosquitos
became
best
friends
or
lifelong
enemies
i
do
know
why
charles
parents
sent
him
larping
he
was
the
kind
of
kid
who
really
enjoyed
that
kind
of
thing
he
was
more
the
type
oh
maybe
not
but
he
just
was
not
into
being
in
costume
in
the
woods
he
spent
the
whole
time
mooching
around
sneering
at
everyone
and
everything
trying
to
convince
us
all
that
we
were
having
the
good
time
we
all
felt
like
we
were
having
you
no
doubt
found
that
kind
of
person
before
the
kind
of
person
who
is
compelled
to
ensure
that
everyone
else
has
a
rotten
time
the
other
thing
about
charles
was
that
he
could
get
the
hang
of
simulated
combat
once
you
start
running
around
the
woods
and
playing
these
elaborate
games
it
easy
to
get
totally
adrenalized
to
the
point
where
you
ready
to
tear
out
someone
throat
this
is
not
a
good
state
to
be
in
when
you
carrying
a
prop
sword
club
pike
or
other
utensil
this
is
why
no
one
is
ever
allowed
to
hit
anyone
under
any
circumstances
in
these
games
instead
when
you
get
close
enough
to
someone
to
fight
you
play
a
quick
couple
rounds
of
with
modifiers
based
on
your
experience
armaments
and
condition
the
referees
mediate
disputes
it
quite
civilized
and
a
little
weird
you
go
running
after
someone
through
the
woods
catch
up
with
him
bare
your
teeth
and
sit
down
to
play
a
little
roshambo
but
it
works
and
it
keeps
everything
safe
and
fun
charles
could
really
get
the
hang
of
this
i
think
he
was
perfectly
capable
of
understanding
that
the
rule
was
no
contact
but
he
was
simultaneously
capable
of
deciding
that
the
rule
did
matter
and
that
he
was
going
to
abide
by
it
the
refs
called
him
on
it
a
bunch
of
times
over
the
weekend
and
he
kept
on
promising
to
stick
by
it
and
kept
on
going
back
he
was
one
of
the
bigger
kids
there
already
and
he
was
fond
of
accidentally
tackling
you
at
the
end
of
a
chase
not
fun
when
you
get
tackled
into
the
rocky
forest
floor
i
had
just
mightily
smote
darryl
in
a
little
clearing
where
he
been
and
we
were
having
a
little
laugh
over
my
extreme
sneakiness
he
was
going
to
go
monstering
killed
players
could
switch
to
playing
monsters
which
meant
that
the
longer
the
game
wore
on
the
more
monsters
there
were
coming
after
you
meaning
that
everyone
got
to
keep
on
playing
and
the
game
battles
just
got
more
and
more
epic
that
was
when
charles
came
out
of
the
woods
behind
me
and
tackled
me
throwing
me
to
the
ground
so
hard
that
i
could
breathe
for
a
moment
gotcha
he
yelled
i
only
knew
him
slightly
before
this
and
i
never
thought
much
of
him
but
now
i
was
ready
for
murder
i
climbed
slowly
to
my
feet
and
looked
at
him
his
chest
heaving
grinning
you
so
dead
he
said
i
totally
got
you
i
smiled
and
something
felt
wrong
and
sore
in
my
face
i
touched
my
upper
lip
it
was
bloody
my
nose
was
bleeding
and
my
lip
was
split
cut
on
a
root
i
into
when
he
tackled
me
i
wiped
the
blood
on
my
and
smiled
i
made
like
i
thought
that
it
was
all
in
fun
i
laughed
a
little
i
moved
towards
him
charles
was
fooled
he
was
already
backing
away
trying
to
fade
into
the
woods
darryl
moved
to
flank
him
i
took
the
other
flank
abruptly
he
turned
and
ran
darryl
foot
hooked
his
ankle
and
sent
him
sprawling
we
rushed
him
just
in
time
to
hear
a
ref
whistle
the
ref
had
seen
charles
foul
me
but
he
seen
charles
play
that
weekend
he
sent
charles
back
to
the
camp
entrance
and
told
him
he
was
out
of
the
game
charles
complained
mightily
but
to
our
satisfaction
the
ref
was
having
any
of
it
once
charles
had
gone
he
gave
both
a
lecture
too
telling
us
that
our
retaliation
was
no
more
justified
than
charles
attack
it
was
that
night
once
the
games
had
ended
we
all
got
hot
showers
in
the
scout
dorms
darryl
and
i
stole
charles
clothes
and
towel
we
tied
them
in
knots
and
dropped
them
in
the
urinal
a
lot
of
the
boys
were
happy
to
contribute
to
the
effort
of
soaking
them
charles
had
been
very
enthusiastic
about
his
tackles
i
wish
i
could
have
watched
him
when
he
got
out
of
his
shower
and
discovered
his
clothes
it
a
hard
decision
do
you
run
naked
across
the
camp
or
pick
apart
the
tight
knots
in
your
clothes
and
then
put
them
on
he
chose
nudity
i
probably
would
have
chosen
the
same
we
lined
up
along
the
route
from
the
showers
to
the
shed
where
the
packs
were
stored
and
applauded
him
i
was
at
the
front
of
the
line
leading
the
applause
the
scout
camp
weekends
only
came
three
or
four
times
a
year
which
left
darryl
and
me
and
lots
of
other
larpers
with
a
serious
larp
deficiency
in
our
lives
luckily
there
were
the
wretched
daylight
games
in
the
city
hotels
wretched
daylight
is
another
larp
rival
vampire
clans
and
vampire
hunters
and
it
got
its
own
quirky
rules
players
get
cards
to
help
them
resolve
combat
skirmishes
so
each
skirmish
involves
playing
a
little
hand
of
a
strategic
card
game
vampires
can
become
invisible
by
cloaking
themselves
crossing
their
arms
over
their
chests
and
all
the
other
players
have
to
pretend
they
do
see
them
continuing
on
with
their
conversations
about
their
plans
and
so
on
the
true
test
of
a
good
player
is
whether
you
honest
enough
to
go
on
spilling
your
secrets
in
front
of
an
invisible
rival
without
acting
as
though
he
was
in
the
room
there
were
a
couple
of
big
wretched
daylight
games
every
month
the
organizers
of
the
games
had
a
good
relationship
with
the
city
hotels
and
they
let
it
be
known
that
they
take
ten
unbooked
rooms
on
friday
night
and
fill
them
with
players
who
run
around
the
hotel
playing
wretched
daylight
in
the
corridors
around
the
pool
and
so
on
eating
at
the
hotel
restaurant
and
paying
for
the
hotel
wifi
they
close
the
booking
on
friday
afternoon
email
us
and
we
go
straight
from
school
to
whichever
hotel
it
was
bringing
our
knapsacks
sleeping
six
or
eight
to
a
room
for
the
weekend
living
on
playing
until
three
am
it
was
good
safe
fun
that
our
parents
could
get
behind
the
organizers
were
a
literacy
charity
that
ran
kids
writing
workshops
drama
workshops
and
so
on
they
had
been
running
the
games
for
ten
years
without
incident
everything
was
strictly
and
to
keep
the
organizers
from
getting
busted
on
some
kind
of
corruption
of
minors
rap
we
draw
between
ten
and
a
hundred
players
depending
on
the
weekend
and
for
the
cost
of
a
couple
movies
you
could
have
two
and
a
half
days
worth
of
solid
fun
one
day
though
they
lucked
into
a
block
of
rooms
at
the
monaco
a
hotel
in
the
tenderloin
that
catered
to
arty
older
tourists
the
kind
of
place
where
every
room
came
with
a
goldfish
bowl
where
the
lobby
was
full
of
beautiful
old
people
in
fine
clothes
showing
off
their
plastic
surgery
results
normally
the
mundanes
our
word
for
just
ignored
us
figuring
that
we
were
skylarking
kids
but
that
weekend
there
happened
to
be
an
editor
for
an
italian
travel
magazine
staying
and
he
took
an
interest
in
things
he
cornered
me
as
i
skulked
in
the
lobby
hoping
to
spot
the
of
my
rivals
and
swoop
in
on
him
and
draw
his
blood
i
was
standing
against
the
wall
with
my
arms
folded
over
my
chest
being
invisible
when
he
came
up
to
me
and
asked
me
in
accented
english
what
me
and
my
friends
were
doing
in
the
hotel
that
weekend
i
tried
to
brush
him
off
but
he
would
be
put
off
so
i
figured
i
just
make
something
up
and
he
go
away
i
did
imagine
that
he
print
it
i
really
did
imagine
that
it
would
get
picked
up
by
the
american
press
we
here
because
our
prince
has
died
and
so
we
had
to
come
in
search
of
a
new
ruler
a
prince
yes
i
said
getting
into
it
we
the
old
people
we
came
to
america
in
the
century
and
have
had
our
own
royal
family
in
the
wilds
of
pennsylvania
ever
since
we
live
simply
in
the
woods
we
do
use
modern
technology
but
the
prince
was
the
last
of
the
line
and
he
died
last
week
some
terrible
wasting
disease
took
him
the
young
men
of
my
clan
have
left
to
find
the
descendants
of
his
who
went
away
to
join
the
modern
people
in
the
time
of
my
grandfather
he
is
said
to
have
multiplied
and
we
will
find
the
last
of
his
bloodline
and
bring
them
back
to
their
rightful
home
i
read
a
lot
of
fantasy
novels
this
kind
of
thing
came
easily
to
me
we
found
a
woman
who
knew
of
these
descendants
she
told
us
one
was
staying
in
this
hotel
and
we
come
to
find
him
but
we
been
tracked
here
by
a
rival
clan
who
would
keep
us
from
bringing
home
our
prince
to
keep
us
weak
and
easy
to
dominate
thus
it
is
vital
we
keep
to
ourselves
we
do
not
talk
to
the
new
people
when
we
can
help
it
talking
to
you
now
causes
me
great
discomfort
he
was
watching
me
shrewdly
i
had
uncrossed
my
arms
which
meant
that
i
was
now
visible
to
rival
vampires
one
of
whom
had
been
slowly
sneaking
up
on
us
at
the
last
moment
i
turned
and
saw
her
arms
spread
hissing
at
us
vamping
it
up
in
high
style
i
threw
my
arms
wide
and
hissed
back
at
her
then
pelted
through
the
lobby
hopping
over
a
leather
sofa
and
deking
around
a
potted
plant
making
her
chase
me
i
scouted
an
escape
route
down
through
the
stairwell
to
the
basement
and
i
took
it
shaking
her
off
i
did
see
him
again
that
weekend
but
i
relate
the
story
to
some
of
my
fellow
larpers
who
embroidered
the
tale
and
found
lots
of
opportunities
to
tell
it
over
the
weekend
the
italian
magazine
had
a
staffer
who
done
her
master
degree
on
amish
communities
in
rural
pennsylvania
and
she
thought
we
sounded
awfully
interesting
based
on
the
notes
and
taped
interviews
of
her
boss
from
his
trip
to
san
francisco
she
wrote
a
fascinating
article
about
these
weird
juvenile
cultists
who
were
crisscrossing
america
in
search
of
their
prince
hell
people
will
print
anything
these
days
but
the
thing
was
stories
like
that
get
picked
up
and
republished
first
it
was
italian
bloggers
then
a
few
american
bloggers
people
across
the
country
reported
sightings
of
the
old
people
though
whether
they
were
making
it
up
or
whether
others
were
playing
the
same
game
i
did
know
it
worked
its
way
up
the
media
all
the
way
to
the
york
who
unfortunately
have
an
unhealthy
appetite
for
the
reporter
they
put
on
the
story
eventually
tracked
it
down
to
the
monaco
hotel
who
put
them
in
touch
with
the
larp
organizers
who
laughingly
spilled
the
whole
story
well
at
that
point
larping
got
a
lot
less
cool
we
became
known
as
the
nation
foremost
hoaxers
as
weird
pathological
liars
the
press
who
we
inadvertently
tricked
into
covering
the
story
of
the
old
people
were
now
interested
in
redeeming
themselves
by
reporting
on
how
unbelievably
weird
we
larpers
were
and
that
was
when
charles
let
everyone
in
school
know
that
darryl
and
i
were
the
biggest
larping
weenies
in
the
city
that
was
not
a
good
season
some
of
the
gang
did
mind
but
we
did
the
teasing
was
merciless
charles
led
it
i
find
plastic
fangs
in
my
bag
and
kids
i
passed
in
the
hall
would
go
bleh
bleh
like
a
cartoon
vampire
or
they
talk
with
fake
transylvanian
accents
when
i
was
around
we
switched
to
arging
pretty
soon
afterwards
it
was
more
fun
in
some
ways
and
it
was
a
lot
less
weird
every
now
and
again
though
i
missed
my
cape
and
those
weekends
in
the
hotel
the
opposite
of
esprit
is
the
way
that
life
embarrassments
come
back
to
haunt
us
even
after
they
long
past
i
could
remember
every
stupid
thing
i
ever
said
or
done
recall
them
with
clarity
any
time
i
was
feeling
low
i
naturally
start
to
remember
other
times
i
felt
that
way
a
of
humiliations
coming
one
after
another
to
my
mind
as
i
tried
to
concentrate
on
masha
and
my
impending
doom
the
old
people
incident
kept
coming
back
to
haunt
me
there
been
a
similar
sick
sinking
doomed
feeling
then
as
more
and
more
press
outlets
picked
up
the
story
as
the
likelihood
increased
of
someone
figuring
out
that
it
had
been
me
who
sprung
the
story
on
the
stupid
italian
editor
in
the
designer
jeans
with
crooked
seams
the
starched
collarless
shirt
and
the
oversized
glasses
there
an
alternative
to
dwelling
on
your
mistakes
you
can
learn
from
them
it
a
good
theory
anyway
maybe
the
reason
your
subconscious
dredges
up
all
these
miserable
ghosts
is
that
they
need
to
get
closure
before
they
can
rest
peacefully
in
humiliation
afterlife
my
subconscious
kept
visiting
me
with
ghosts
in
the
hopes
that
i
would
do
something
to
let
them
rest
in
peace
all
the
way
home
i
turned
over
this
memory
and
the
thought
of
what
i
would
do
about
masha
in
case
she
was
playing
me
i
needed
some
insurance
and
by
the
time
i
reached
my
house
to
be
swept
up
into
melancholy
hugs
from
mom
and
dad
i
had
it
the
trick
was
to
time
this
so
that
it
happened
fast
enough
that
the
dhs
could
prepare
for
it
but
with
a
long
enough
lead
time
that
the
xnet
would
have
time
to
turn
out
in
force
the
trick
was
to
stage
this
so
that
there
were
too
many
present
to
arrest
us
all
but
to
put
it
somewhere
that
the
press
could
see
it
and
the
grownups
so
the
dhs
would
just
gas
us
again
the
trick
was
to
come
up
with
something
with
the
media
friendliness
of
the
levitation
of
the
pentagon
the
trick
was
to
stage
something
that
we
could
rally
around
like
berkeley
students
refusing
to
let
one
of
their
number
be
taken
away
in
a
police
van
the
trick
was
to
put
the
press
there
ready
to
say
what
the
police
did
the
way
they
had
in
in
chicago
it
was
going
to
be
some
trick
i
cut
out
of
school
an
hour
early
the
next
day
using
my
customary
techniques
for
getting
out
not
caring
if
it
would
trigger
some
kind
of
new
dhs
checker
that
would
result
in
my
parents
getting
a
note
one
way
or
another
my
parents
last
problem
after
tomorrow
would
be
whether
i
was
in
trouble
at
school
i
met
ange
at
her
place
she
had
to
cut
out
of
school
even
earlier
but
she
just
made
a
big
deal
out
of
her
cramps
and
pretended
she
was
going
to
keel
over
and
they
sent
her
home
we
started
to
spread
the
word
on
xnet
we
sent
it
in
email
to
trusted
friends
and
immed
it
to
our
buddy
lists
we
roamed
the
decks
and
towns
of
clockwork
plunder
and
told
our
giving
everyone
enough
information
to
get
them
to
show
up
but
not
so
much
as
to
tip
our
hand
to
the
dhs
was
tricky
but
i
thought
i
had
just
the
right
balance
vampmob
tomorrow
if
you
a
goth
dress
to
impress
if
you
not
a
goth
find
a
goth
and
borrow
some
clothes
think
vampire
the
game
starts
at
sharp
sharp
be
there
and
ready
to
be
divided
into
teams
the
game
lasts
minutes
so
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
to
school
afterward
location
will
be
revealed
tomorrow
email
your
public
key
to
and
check
your
messages
at
for
the
update
if
that
too
early
for
you
stay
up
all
night
that
what
we
going
to
do
this
is
the
most
fun
you
will
have
all
year
guaranteed
believe
then
i
sent
a
short
message
to
masha
tomorrow
a
minute
later
she
emailed
back
i
thought
so
vampmob
huh
you
work
fast
wear
a
red
hat
travel
light
what
do
you
bring
along
when
you
go
fugitive
i
carried
enough
heavy
packs
around
enough
scout
camps
to
know
that
every
ounce
you
add
cuts
into
your
shoulders
with
all
the
crushing
force
of
gravity
with
every
step
you
take
it
not
just
one
ounce
it
one
ounce
that
you
carry
for
a
million
steps
it
a
ton
right
ange
said
smart
and
you
never
take
more
than
three
days
worth
of
clothes
either
you
can
rinse
stuff
out
in
the
sink
better
to
have
a
spot
on
your
than
a
suitcase
that
too
big
and
heavy
to
stash
under
a
she
pulled
out
a
ballistic
nylon
courier
bag
that
went
across
her
chest
between
her
breasts
something
that
made
me
get
a
little
sweaty
and
slung
diagonally
across
her
back
it
was
roomy
inside
and
she
set
it
down
on
the
bed
now
she
was
piling
clothes
next
to
it
i
figure
that
three
a
pair
of
pants
a
pair
of
shorts
three
changes
of
underwear
three
pairs
of
socks
and
a
sweater
will
do
it
she
dumped
out
her
gym
bag
and
picked
out
her
toiletries
i
have
to
remember
to
stick
my
toothbrush
in
tomorrow
morning
before
i
head
down
to
civic
center
watching
her
pack
was
impressive
she
was
ruthless
about
it
all
it
was
also
freaky
it
made
me
realize
that
the
next
day
i
was
going
to
go
away
maybe
for
a
long
time
maybe
forever
do
i
bring
my
xbox
she
asked
i
got
a
ton
of
stuff
on
the
notes
and
sketches
and
email
i
would
want
it
to
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
it
all
encrypted
i
said
that
standard
with
paranoidxbox
but
leave
the
xbox
behind
there
be
plenty
of
them
in
la
just
create
a
pirate
party
account
and
email
an
image
of
your
to
yourself
i
going
to
do
the
same
when
i
get
home
she
did
so
and
queued
up
the
email
it
was
going
to
take
a
couple
hours
for
all
the
data
to
squeeze
through
her
neighbor
wifi
network
and
wing
its
way
to
sweden
then
she
closed
the
flap
on
the
bag
and
tightened
the
compression
straps
she
had
something
the
size
of
a
slung
over
her
back
now
and
i
stared
admiringly
at
it
she
could
walk
down
the
street
with
that
under
her
shoulder
and
no
one
would
look
twice
she
looked
like
she
was
on
her
way
to
school
one
more
thing
she
said
and
went
to
her
bedside
table
and
took
out
the
condoms
she
took
the
strips
of
rubbers
out
of
the
box
and
opened
the
bag
and
stuck
them
inside
then
gave
me
a
slap
on
the
ass
now
what
i
said
now
we
go
to
your
place
and
do
your
stuff
it
time
i
met
your
parents
no
she
left
the
bag
amid
the
piles
of
clothes
and
junk
all
over
the
floor
she
was
ready
to
turn
her
back
on
all
of
it
walk
away
just
to
be
with
me
just
to
support
the
cause
it
made
me
feel
brave
too
mom
was
already
home
when
i
got
there
she
had
her
laptop
open
on
the
kitchen
table
and
was
answering
email
while
talking
into
a
headset
connected
to
it
helping
some
poor
yorkshireman
and
his
family
acclimate
to
living
in
louisiana
i
came
through
the
door
and
ange
followed
grinning
like
mad
but
holding
my
hand
so
tight
i
could
feel
the
bones
grinding
together
i
did
know
what
she
was
so
worried
about
it
was
like
she
was
going
to
end
up
spending
a
lot
of
time
hanging
around
with
my
parents
after
this
even
if
it
went
badly
mom
hung
up
on
the
yorkshireman
when
we
got
in
hello
marcus
she
said
giving
me
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
and
who

mom

is
my
mom
lillian
mom

up
and
gave
ange
a
hug
it
very
good
to
meet
you
darling
she
said
looking
her
over
from
top
to
bottom
ange
looked
pretty
acceptable
i
think
she
dressed
well
and
and
you
could
tell
how
smart
she
was
just
by
looking
at
her
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
mrs
yallow
she
said
she
sounded
very
confident
and
much
better
than
i
had
when
i
met
her
mom
it
lillian
love
she
said
she
was
taking
in
every
detail

pretty
acclimated
to
living
in
california

eat
anything
that

me
first
she
said
she
a
junkie
i
said
you
could
serve
her
old
tires
and
she
eat
if
she
could
smother
them
in
salsa
ange
socked
me
gently
in
the
shoulder
i
was
going
to
order
thai
mom
said
i
add
a
couple
of
their
dishes
to
the
order
ange
thanked
her
politely
and
mom
bustled
around
the
kitchen
getting
us
glasses
of
juice
and
a
plate
of
biscuits
and
asking
three
times
if
we
wanted
any
tea
i
squirmed
a
little
thanks
mom
i
said
we
going
to
go
upstairs
for
a
while
mom
eyes
narrowed
for
a
second
then
she
smiled
again
of
course
she
said
your
father
will
be
home
in
an
hour
we
eat
then
i
had
my
vampire
stuff
all
stashed
in
the
back
of
my
closet
i
let
ange
sort
through
it
while
i
went
through
my
clothes
i
was
only
going
as
far
as
la
they
had
stores
there
all
the
clothing
i
could
need

just
needed
to
get
together

or
four
favorite
tees
and
a
favorite
pair
of
jeans
a
tube
of
deodorant
a
roll
of
dental
floss

said

said

was
going
to
clean

bank
account

the
way
home
at
an
atm
i
got
maybe
five
hundred
saved
up

going
to
spend
it
on
she
said
ever
since
the
xnet
i
have
had
to
even
pay
any
service
charges
i
think
i
got
three
hundred
or
so
well
there
you
go
grab
it
on
the
way
to
civic
center
in
the
morning
i
had
a
big
i
used
when
i
was
hauling
lots
of
gear
around
town
it
was
less
conspicuous
than
my
camping
pack
ange
went
through
my
piles
mercilessly
and
culled
them
down
to
her
favorites
once
it
was
packed
and
under
my
bed
we
both
sat
down
we
going
to
have
to
get
up
really
early
tomorrow
she
said
yeah
big
day
the
plan
was
to
get
messages
out
with
a
bunch
of
fake
vampmob
locations
tomorrow
sending
people
out
to
secluded
spots
within
a
few
minutes
walk
of
civic
center
we
cut
out
a
stencil
that
just
said
vampmob
civic
center
that
we
would
at
those
spots
around
that
would
keep
the
dhs
from
locking
down
the
civic
center
before
we
got
there
i
had
the
mailbot
ready
to
send
out
the
messages
at
i
just
leave
my
xbox
running
when
i
went
out
how
long
she
trailed
off
that
what
i
been
wondering
too
i
said
it
could
be
a
long
time
i
suppose
but
who
knows
with
barbara
article
coming
out
i
queued
an
email
to
her
for
the
next
morning
too
and
all
maybe
we
be
heroes
in
two
weeks
maybe
she
said
and
sighed
i
put
my
arm
around
her
her
shoulders
were
shaking
i
terrified
i
said
i
think
that
it
would
be
crazy
not
to
be
terrified
yeah
she
said
yeah
mom
called
us
to
dinner
dad
shook
ange
hand
he
looked
unshaved
and
worried
the
way
he
had
since
we
gone
to
see
barbara
but
on
meeting
ange
a
little
of
the
old
dad
came
back
she
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
and
he
insisted
that
she
call
him
drew
dinner
was
actually
really
good
the
ice
broke
when
ange
took
out
her
mister
and
treated
her
plate
and
explained
about
scoville
units
dad
tried
a
forkful
of
her
food
and
went
reeling
into
the
kitchen
to
drink
a
gallon
of
milk
believe
it
or
not
mom
still
tried
it
after
that
and
gave
every
impression
of
loving
it
mom

an
undiscovered
spicy
food
prodigy

natural
before
she
left

the
mister

secret
was
cannibalism

walk
among
the
living
you
need
to
bite
as
many
other
vampires
as
you
can
in
order

two
hundred
invites

but
when
i
sat
bolt
upright
at
and
grabbed
my
xbox
there
were
replies
there
four
i
fed
the
addresses
to
the
bot
and
stole
out
of
the
house
i
descended
the
stairs
listening
to
my
father
snore
and
my
mom
rolling
over
in
their
bed
i
locked
the
door
behind
me
at
am
potrero
hill
was
as
quiet
as
the
countryside
there
were
some
distant
traffic
rumbles
and
once
a
car
crawled
past
me
i
stopped
at
an
atm
and
drew
out
in
twenties
rolled
them
up
and
put
a
around
them
and
stuck
the
roll
in
a
pocket
low
on
the
thigh
of
my
vampire
pants
i
was
wearing
my
cape
again
and
a
ruffled
shirt
and
tuxedo
pants
that
had
been
modded
to
have
enough
pockets
to
carry
all
my
little
bits
and
pieces
i
had
on
pointed
boots
with
buckles
and
i
teased
my
hair
into
a
black
dandelion
clock
around
my
head
ange
was
bringing
the
white
makeup
and
had
promised
to
do
my
eyeliner
and
black
why
the
hell
not
when
was
the
next
time
i
was
going
to
get
to
play
dressup
like
this
ange
met
me
in
front
of
her
house
she
had
her
backpack
on
too
and
fishnet
tights
a
ruffled
gothic
lolita
maid
dress
white
elaborate
kabuki
and
her
fingers
and
throat
dripped
with
silver
jewelry
you
look
we
said
to
each
other
in
unison
then
laughed
quietly
and
stole
off
through
the
streets
cans
in
our
pockets
as
i
surveyed
civic
center
i
thought
about
what
it
would
look
like
once
vampmobbers
converged
on
it
i
expected
them
in
ten
minutes
out
front
of
city
hall
already
the
big
plaza
teemed
with
commuters
who
neatly
sidestepped
the
homeless
people
begging
there
i
always
hated
civic
center
it
a
collection
of
huge
buildings
court
houses
museums
and
civic
buildings
like
city
hall
the
sidewalks
are
wide
the
buildings
are
white
in
the
tourist
guides
to
san
francisco
they
manage
to
photograph
it
so
that
it
looks
like
epcot
center
futuristic
and
austere
but
on
the
ground
it
grimy
and
gross
homeless
people
sleep
on
all
the
benches
the
district
is
empty
by
except
for
drunks
and
druggies
because
with
only
one
kind
of
building
there
there
no
legit
reason
for
people
to
hang
around
after
the
sun
goes
down
it
more
like
a
mall
than
a
neighborhood
and
the
only
businesses
there
are
and
liquor
stores
places
that
cater
to
the
families
of
crooks
on
trial
and
the
bums
who
make
it
their
nighttime
home
i
really
came
to
understand
all
of
this
when
i
read
an
interview
with
an
amazing
old
urban
planner
a
woman
called
jane
jacobs
who
was
the
first
person
to
really
nail
why
it
was
wrong
to
slice
cities
up
with
freeways
stick
all
the
poor
people
in
housing
projects
and
use
zoning
laws
to
tightly
control
who
got
to
do
what
where
jacobs
explained
that
real
cities
are
organic
and
they
have
a
lot
of
variety
rich
and
poor
white
and
brown
anglo
and
mex
retail
and
residential
and
even
industrial
a
neighborhood
like
that
has
all
kinds
of
people
passing
through
it
at
all
hours
of
the
day
or
night
so
you
get
businesses
that
cater
to
every
need
you
get
people
around
all
the
time
acting
like
eyes
on
the
street
you
encountered
this
before
you
go
walking
around
some
older
part
of
some
city
and
you
find
that
it
full
of
the
coolest
looking
stores
guys
in
suits
and
people
in
upscale
restaurants
and
funky
cafes
a
little
movie
theater
maybe
houses
with
elaborate
sure
there
might
be
a
starbucks
too
but
there
also
a
fruit
market
and
a
florist
who
appears
to
be
three
hundred
years
old
as
she
snips
carefully
at
the
flowers
in
her
windows
it
the
opposite
of
a
planned
space
like
a
mall
it
feels
like
a
wild
garden
or
even
a
woods
like
it
you
could
get
any
further
from
that
than
civic
center
i
read
an
interview
with
jacobs
where
she
talked
about
the
great
old
neighborhood
they
knocked
down
to
build
it
it
had
been
just
that
kind
of
neighborhood
the
kind
of
place
that
happened
without
permission
or
rhyme
or
reason
jacobs
said
that
she
predicted
that
within
a
few
years
civic
center
would
be
one
of
the
worst
neighborhoods
in
the
city
a
at
night
a
place
that
sustained
a
thin
crop
of
weedy
booze
shops
and
motels
in
the
interview
she
did
seem
very
glad
to
have
been
vindicated
she
sounded
like
she
was
talking
about
a
dead
friend
when
she
described
what
civic
center
had
become
now
it
was
rush
hour
and
civic
center
was
as
busy
as
it
could
be
the
civic
center
bart
also
serves
as
the
major
station
for
muni
trolley
lines
and
if
you
need
to
switch
from
one
to
another
that
where
you
do
it
at
there
were
thousands
of
people
coming
up
the
stairs
going
down
the
stairs
getting
into
and
out
of
taxis
and
on
and
off
buses
they
got
squeezed
by
dhs
checkpoints
by
the
different
civic
buildings
and
routed
around
aggressive
panhandlers
they
all
smelled
like
their
shampoos
and
colognes
fresh
out
of
the
shower
and
armored
in
their
work
suits
swinging
laptop
bags
and
briefcases
at
civic
center
was
business
central
and
here
came
the
vamps
a
couple
dozen
coming
down
van
ness
a
couple
dozen
coming
up
market
more
coming
from
the
other
side
of
market
more
coming
up
from
van
ness
they
slipped
around
the
side
of
the
buildings
wearing
the
white
and
the
black
eyeliner
black
clothes
leather
jackets
huge
stompy
boots
fishnet
fingerless
gloves
they
began
to
fill
up
the
plaza
a
few
of
the
business
people
gave
them
passing
glances
and
then
looked
away
not
wanting
to
let
these
weirdos
into
their
personal
realities
as
they
thought
about
whatever
crap
they
were
about
to
wade
through
for
another
eight
hours
the
vamps
milled
around
not
sure
when
the
game
was
on
they
pooled
together
in
large
groups
like
an
oil
spill
in
reverse
all
this
black
gathering
in
one
place
a
lot
of
them
sported
hats
bowlers
and
toppers
many
of
the
girls
were
in
elegant
gothic
lolita
maid
costumes
with
huge
platforms
i
tried
to
estimate
the
numbers
then
five
minutes
later
it
was
they
were
still
streaming
in
the
vamps
had
brought
friends
someone
grabbed
my
ass
i
spun
around
and
saw
ange
laughing
so
hard
she
had
to
hold
her
thighs
bent
double
look
at
them
all
man
look
at
them
all
she
gasped
the
square
was
twice
as
crowded
as
it
had
been
a
few
minutes
ago
i
had
no
idea
how
many
xnetters
there
were
but
easily
of
them
had
just
showed
up
to
my
little
party
christ
the
dhs
and
sfpd
cops
were
starting
to
mill
around
talking
into
their
radios
and
clustering
together
i
heard
a
siren
all
right
i
said
shaking
ange
by
the
arm
all
right
let
we
both
slipped
off
into
the
crowd
and
as
soon
as
we
encountered
our
first
vamp
we
both
said
loudly
bite
bite
bite
bite
bite
my
victim
was
a
stunned
but
cute
girl
with
drawn
on
her
hands
and
smudged
mascara
running
down
her
cheeks
she
said
crap
and
moved
away
acknowledging
that
i
gotten
her
the
call
of
bite
bite
bite
bite
bite
had
scrambled
the
other
nearby
vamps
some
of
them
were
attacking
each
other
others
were
moving
for
cover
hiding
out
i
had
my
victim
for
the
minute
so
i
skulked
away
using
mundanes
for
cover
all
around
me
the
cry
of
bite
bite
bite
bite
bite
and
shouts
and
laughs
and
curses
the
sound
spread
like
a
virus
through
the
crowd
all
the
vamps
knew
the
game
was
on
now
and
the
ones
who
were
clustered
together
were
dropping
like
flies
they
laughed
and
cussed
and
moved
away
clueing
the
vamps
that
the
game
was
on
and
more
vamps
were
arriving
by
the
second
it
was
time
to
bag
another
vamp
i
crouched
low
and
moved
through
the
legs
of
the
straights
as
they
headed
for
the
bart
stairs
they
jerked
back
with
surprise
and
swerved
to
avoid
me
i
had
my
eyes
on
a
set
of
black
platform
boots
with
steel
dragons
over
the
toes
and
so
i
was
expecting
it
when
i
came
face
to
face
with
another
vamp
a
guy
of
about
or
hair
gelled
straight
back
and
wearing
a
pvc
marilyn
manson
jacket
draped
with
necklaces
of
fake
tusks
carved
with
intricate
symbols
bite
bite
bite
he
began
when
one
of
the
mundanes
tripped
over
him
and
they
both
went
sprawling
i
leapt
over
to
him
and
shouted
bite
bite
bite
bite
bite
before
he
could
untangle
himself
again
more
vamps
were
arriving
the
suits
were
really
freaking
out
the
game
overflowed
the
sidewalk
and
moved
into
van
ness
spreading
up
toward
market
street
drivers
honked
the
trolleys
made
angry
i
heard
more
sirens
but
now
traffic
was
snarled
in
every
direction
it
was
freaking
bite
bite
bite
bite
bite
the
sound
came
from
all
around
me
there
were
so
many
vamps
there
playing
so
furiously
it
was
like
a
roar
i
risked
standing
up
and
looking
around
and
found
that
i
was
right
in
the
middle
of
a
giant
crowd
of
vamps
that
went
as
far
as
i
could
see
in
every
direction
bite
bite
bite
bite
bite
this
was
even
better
than
the
concert
in
dolores
park
that
had
been
angry
and
rockin
but
this
was
well
it
was
just
it
was
like
going
back
to
the
playground
to
the
epic
games
of
tag
we
play
on
lunch
breaks
when
the
sun
was
out
hundreds
of
people
chasing
each
other
around
the
adults
and
the
cars
just
made
it
more
fun
more
funny
that
what
it
was
it
was
we
were
all
laughing
now
but
the
cops
were
really
mobilizing
now
i
heard
helicopters
any
second
now
it
would
be
over
time
for
the
endgame
i
grabbed
a
vamp
endgame
when
the
cops
order
us
to
disperse
pretend
you
been
gassed
pass
it
on
what
did
i
just
say
the
vamp
was
a
girl
tiny
so
short
i
thought
she
was
really
young
but
she
must
have
been
or
from
her
face
and
the
smile
oh
that
wicked
she
said
what
did
i
say
endgame
when
the
cops
order
us
to
disperse
pretend
you
been
gassed
pass
it
on
what
did
i
just
say
right
i
said
pass
it
on
she
melted
into
the
crowd
i
grabbed
another
vamp
i
passed
it
on
he
went
off
to
pass
it
on
somewhere
in
the
crowd
i
knew
ange
was
doing
this
too
somewhere
in
the
crowd
there
might
be
infiltrators
fake
xnetters
but
what
could
they
do
with
this
knowledge
it
not
like
the
cops
had
a
choice
they
were
going
to
order
us
to
disperse
that
was
guaranteed
i
had
to
get
to
ange
the
plan
was
to
meet
at
the
founder
statue
in
the
plaza
but
reaching
it
was
going
to
be
hard
the
crowd
was
moving
anymore
it
was
like
the
mob
had
in
the
way
down
to
the
bart
station
on
the
day
the
bombs
went
off
i
struggled
to
make
my
way
through
it
just
as
the
pa
underneath
the
helicopter
switched
on
this
is
the
department
of
homeland
security
you
are
ordered
to
disperse
immediately
around
me
hundreds
of
vamps
fell
to
the
ground
clutching
their
throats
clawing
at
their
eyes
gasping
for
breath
it
was
easy
to
fake
being
gassed
we
all
had
plenty
of
time
to
study
the
footage
of
the
partiers
in
mission
dolores
park
going
down
under
the
clouds
disperse
immediately
i
fell
to
the
ground
protecting
my
pack
reaching
around
to
the
red
baseball
hat
folded
into
the
waistband
of
my
pants
i
jammed
it
on
my
head
and
then
grabbed
my
throat
and
made
horrendous
retching
noises
the
only
ones
still
standing
were
the
mundanes
the
salarymen
who
been
just
trying
to
get
to
their
jobs
i
looked
around
as
best
as
i
could
at
them
as
i
choked
and
gasped
this
is
the
department
of
homeland
security
you
are
ordered
to
disperse
immediately
disperse
immediately
the
voice
of
god
made
my
bowels
ache
i
felt
it
in
my
molars
and
in
my
femurs
and
my
spine
the
salarymen
were
scared
they
were
moving
as
fast
as
they
could
but
in
no
particular
direction
the
helicopters
seemed
to
be
directly
overhead
no
matter
where
you
stood
the
cops
were
wading
into
the
crowd
now
and
they
put
on
their
helmets
some
had
shields
some
had
gas
masks
i
gasped
harder
then
the
salarymen
were
running
i
probably
would
have
run
too
i
watched
a
guy
whip
a
jacket
off
and
wrap
it
around
his
face
before
heading
south
toward
mission
only
to
trip
up
and
go
sprawling
his
curses
joined
the
choking
sounds
this
was
supposed
to
happen
the
choking
was
just
supposed
to
freak
people
out
and
get
them
confused
not
panic
them
into
a
stampede
there
were
screams
now
screams
i
recognized
all
too
well
from
the
night
in
the
park
that
was
the
sound
of
people
who
were
scared
spitless
running
into
each
other
as
they
tried
like
hell
to
get
away
and
then
the
sirens
began
i
had
heard
that
sound
since
the
bombs
went
off
but
i
would
never
forget
it
it
sliced
through
me
and
went
straight
into
my
balls
turning
my
legs
into
jelly
on
the
way
it
made
me
want
to
run
away
in
a
panic
i
got
to
my
feet
red
cap
on
my
head
thinking
of
only
one
thing
ange
ange
and
the
founders
statue
everyone
was
on
their
feet
now
running
in
all
directions
screaming
i
pushed
people
out
of
my
way
holding
onto
my
pack
and
my
hat
heading
for
founders
statue
masha
was
looking
for
me
i
was
looking
for
ange
ange
was
out
there
i
pushed
and
cursed
elbowed
someone
someone
came
down
on
my
foot
so
hard
i
felt
something
go
and
i
shoved
him
so
he
went
down
he
tried
to
get
up
and
someone
stepped
on
him
i
shoved
and
pushed
then
i
reached
out
my
arm
to
shove
someone
else
and
strong
hands
grabbed
my
wrist
and
my
elbow
in
one
fluid
motion
and
brought
my
arm
back
around
behind
my
back
it
felt
like
my
shoulder
was
about
to
wrench
out
of
its
socket
and
i
instantly
doubled
over
hollering
a
sound
that
was
barely
audible
over
the
din
of
the
crowd
the
thrum
of
the
choppers
the
wail
of
the
sirens
i
was
brought
back
upright
by
the
strong
hands
behind
me
which
steered
me
like
a
marionette
the
hold
was
so
perfect
i
could
even
think
of
squirming
i
could
think
of
the
noise
or
the
helicopter
or
ange
all
i
could
think
of
was
moving
the
way
that
the
person
who
had
me
wanted
me
to
move
i
was
brought
around
so
that
i
was
with
the
person
it
was
a
girl
whose
face
was
sharp
and
by
a
giant
pair
of
sunglasses
over
the
sunglasses
a
mop
of
bright
pink
hair
spiked
out
in
all
directions
you
i
said
i
knew
her
she
taken
a
picture
of
me
and
threatened
to
rat
me
out
to
truant
watch
that
had
been
five
minutes
before
the
alarms
started
she
been
the
one
ruthless
and
cunning
we
both
run
from
that
spot
in
the
tenderloin
as
the
klaxon
sounded
behind
us
and
we
both
been
picked
up
by
the
cops
i
been
hostile
and
they
decided
that
i
was
an
enemy
she
masha
became
their
ally
hello
she
hissed
in
my
ear
close
as
a
lover
a
shiver
went
up
my
back
she
let
go
of
my
arm
and
i
shook
it
out
christ

said

minutes

it
there
we
doomed
the
gas
is
coming
down
in
two
minutes
in
case
you
missed
it
the
first
time
i
stopped
moving
i
do
go
without
ange
i
said
she
shrugged
suit
yourself
she
shouted
in
my
ear
your
funeral
she
began
to
push
through
the
crowd
moving
away
north
toward
downtown
i
continued
to
push
for
the
founders
statue
a
second
later
my
arm
was
back
in
the
terrible
lock
and
i
was
being
swung
around
and
propelled
forward
you
know
too
much
she
said
you
seen
my
face
you
coming
with
me
i
screamed
at
her
struggled
till
it
felt
like
my
arm
would
break
but
she
was
pushing
me
forward
my
sore
foot
was
agony
with
every
step
my
shoulder
felt
like
it
would
break
with
her
using
me
as
a
battering
ram
we
made
good
progress
through
the
crowd
the
whine
of
the
helicopters
changed
and
she
gave
me
a
harder
push
run
she
yelled
here
comes
the
gas
the
crowd
noise
changed
too
the
choking
sounds
and
scream
sounds
got
much
much
louder
i
heard
that
pitch
of
sound
before
we
were
back
in
the
park
the
gas
was
raining
down
i
held
my
breath
and
we
cleared
the
crowd
and
she
let
go
of
my
arm
i
shook
it
out
i
limped
as
fast
as
i
could
up
the
sidewalk
as
the
crowd
thinned
and
thinned
we
were
heading
towards
a
group
of
dhs
cops
with
riot
shields
and
helmets
and
masks
as
we
drew
near
them
they
moved
to
block
us
but
masha
held
up
a
badge
and
they
melted
away
like
she
was
obi
wan
kenobi
saying
these
are
the
droids
you
looking
for
you
goddamned
i
said
as
we
sped
up
market
street
we
have
to
go
back
for
ange
she
pursed
her
lips
and
shook
her
head
i
feel
for
you
buddy
i
have
seen
my
boyfriend
in
months
he
probably
thinks
i
dead
fortunes
of
war
we
go
back
for
your
ange
we
dead
if
we
push
on
we
have
a
chance
so
long
as
we
have
a
chance
she
has
a
chance
those
kids
are
all
going
to
gitmo
they
probably
take
a
few
hundred
in
for
questioning
and
send
the
rest
home
we
were
moving
up
market
street
now
past
the
strip
joints
where
the
little
encampments
of
bums
and
junkies
sat
stinking
like
open
toilets
masha
guided
me
to
a
little
alcove
in
the
shut
door
of
one
of
the
strip
places
she
stripped
off
her
jacket
and
turned
it
inside
out
the
lining
was
a
muted
stripe
pattern
and
with
the
jacket
seams
reversed
it
hung
differently
she
produced
a
wool
hat
from
her
pocket
and
pulled
it
over
her
hair
letting
it
form
a
jaunty
peak
then
she
took
out
some
remover
wipes
and
went
to
work
on
her
face
and
fingernails
in
a
minute
she
was
a
different
woman
wardrobe
change
she
said
now
you
lose
the
shoes
lose
the
jacket
lose
the
hat
i
could
see
her
point
the
cops
would
be
looking
very
carefully
at
anyone
who
looked
like
they
been
a
part
of
the
vampmob
i
ditched
the
hat
entirely
i
never
liked
ball
caps
then
i
jammed
the
jacket
into
my
pack
and
got
out
a
tee
with
a
picture
of
rosa
luxembourg
on
it
and
pulled
it
over
my
black
tee
i
let
masha
wipe
my
makeup
off
and
clean
my
nails
and
a
minute
later
i
was
clean
switch
off
your
phone
she
said
you
carrying
any
arphids
i
had
my
student
card
my
atm
card
my
fast
pass
they
all
went
into
a
silvered
bag
she
held
out
which
i
recognized
as
a
faraday
pouch
but
as
she
put
them
in
her
pocket
i
realized
i
just
turned
my
id
over
to
her
if
she
was
on
the
other
side
the
magnitude
of
what
had
just
happened
began
to
sink
in
in
my
mind
i
pictured
having
ange
with
me
at
this
point
ange
would
make
it
two
against
one
ange
would
help
me
see
if
there
was
something
amiss
if
masha
was
all
she
said
she
was
put
these
pebbles
in
your
shoes
before
you
put
them
on
it
ok
i
sprained
my
foot
no
gait
recognition
program
will
spot
me
now
she
nodded
once
one
pro
to
another
and
slung
her
pack
i
picked
up
mine
and
we
moved
the
total
time
for
the
changeover
was
less
than
a
minute
we
looked
and
walked
like
two
different
people
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
shook
her
head
come
on
she
said
we
have
to
make
our
rendezvous
do
think
of
running
either
you
got
two
choices
now
me
or
jail
they
be
analyzing
the
footage
from
that
mob
for
days
but
once
they
done
every
face
in
it
will
go
in
a
database
our
departure
will
be
noted
we
are
both
wanted
criminals
now
ï
got
us
off
market
street
on
the
next
block
swinging
back
into
the
tenderloin
i
knew
this
neighborhood
this
was
where
we
gone
hunting
for
an
open
wifi
back
on
the
day
playing
harajuku
fun
madness
where
are
we
going
i
said
we
about
to
catch
a
ride
she
said
shut
up
and
let
me
concentrate
we
moved
fast
and
sweat
streamed
down
my
face
from
under
my
hair
coursed
down
my
back
and
slid
down
the
crack
of
my
ass
and
my
thighs
my
foot
was
hurting
and
i
was
seeing
the
streets
of
san
francisco
race
by
maybe
for
the
last
time
ever
it
did
help
that
we
were
ploughing
straight
uphill
moving
for
the
zone
where
the
seedy
tenderloin
gives
way
to
the
nosebleed
values
of
nob
hill
my
breath
came
in
ragged
gasps
she
moved
us
mostly
up
narrow
alleys
using
the
big
streets
just
to
get
from
one
alley
to
the
next
we
were
just
stepping
into
one
such
alley
sabin
place
when
someone
fell
in
behind
us
and
said
freeze
right
there
it
was
full
of
evil
mirth
we
stopped
and
turned
around
at
the
mouth
of
the
alley
stood
charles
wearing
a
halfhearted
vampmob
outfit
of
black
and
jeans
and
white
hello
marcus
he
said
you
going
somewhere
he
smiled
a
huge
wet
grin
who
your
girlfriend
what
do
you
want
charles
well
i
been
hanging
out
on
that
traitorous
xnet
ever
since
i
spotted
you
giving
out
dvds
at
school
when
i
heard
about
your
vampmob
i
thought
i
go
along
and
hang
around
the
edges
just
to
see
if
you
showed
up
and
what
you
did
you
know
what
i
saw
i
said
nothing
he
had
his
phone
in
his
hand
pointed
at
us
recording
maybe
ready
to
dial
beside
me
masha
had
gone
still
as
a
board
i
saw
you
the
damned
thing
and
i
it
marcus
so
now
i
going
to
call
the
cops
and
we
going
to
wait
right
here
for
them
and
then
you
going
to
go
to
prison
for
a
long
long
time
masha
stepped
forward
stop
right
there
chickie
he
said
i
saw
you
get
him
away
i
saw
it
all
she
took
another
step
forward
and
snatched
the
phone
out
of
his
hand
reaching
behind
her
with
her
other
hand
and
bringing
it
out
holding
a
wallet
open
dhs
she
said
i
dhs
i
been
running
this
twerp
back
to
his
masters
to
see
where
he
went
i
doing
that
now
you
blown
it
we
have
a
name
for
that
we
call
it
of
national
security
you
about
to
hear
that
phrase
a
lot
more
often
charles
took
a
step
backward
his
hands
held
up
in
front
of
him
he
gone
even
paler
under
his
makeup
what
no
i
mean
i
did
know
i
was
trying
to
the
last
thing
we
need
is
a
bunch
of
high
school
junior
buddy
you
can
tell
it
to
the
judge
he
moved
back
again
but
masha
was
fast
she
grabbed
his
wrist
and
twisted
him
into
the
same
judo
hold
she
had
me
in
back
at
civic
center
her
hand
dipped
back
to
her
pockets
and
came
out
holding
a
strip
of
plastic
a
handcuff
strip
which
she
quickly
wound
around
his
wrists
that
was
the
last
thing
i
saw
as
i
took
off
running
i
made
it
as
far
as
the
other
end
of
the
alley
before
she
caught
up
with
me
tackling
me
from
behind
and
sending
me
sprawling
i
could
move
very
fast
not
with
my
hurt
foot
and
the
weight
of
my
pack
i
went
down
in
a
hard
and
skidded
grinding
my
cheek
into
the
grimy
asphalt
jesus
she
said
you
a
goddamned
idiot
you
did
that
did
you
my
heart
thudded
in
my
chest
she
was
on
top
of
me
and
slowly
she
let
me
up
do
i
need
to
cuff
you
marcus
i
got
to
my
feet
i
hurt
all
over
i
wanted
to
die
come
on
she
said
it
not
far
now
turned
out
to
be
a
moving
van
on
a
nob
hill
a
the
size
of
one
of
the
ubiquitous
dhs
trucks
that
still
turned
up
on
san
francisco
street
corners
bristling
with
antennas
this
one
though
said
three
guys
and
a
truck
moving
on
the
side
and
the
three
guys
were
very
much
in
evidence
trekking
in
and
out
of
a
tall
apartment
building
with
a
green
awning
they
were
carrying
crated
furniture
neatly
labeled
boxes
loading
them
one
at
a
time
onto
the
truck
and
carefully
packing
them
there
she
walked
us
around
the
block
once
apparently
unsatisfied
with
something
then
on
the
next
pass
she
made
with
the
man
who
was
watching
the
van
an
older
black
guy
with
a
and
heavy
gloves
he
had
a
kind
face
and
he
smiled
at
us
as
she
led
us
quickly
casually
up
the
truck
three
stairs
and
into
its
depth
under
the
big
table
he
said
we
left
you
some
space
there
the
truck
was
more
than
half
full
but
there
was
a
narrow
corridor
around
a
huge
table
with
a
quilted
blanket
thrown
over
it
and
wound
around
its
legs
masha
pulled
me
under
the
table
it
was
stuffy
and
still
and
dusty
under
there
and
i
suppressed
a
sneeze
as
we
scrunched
in
among
the
boxes
the
space
was
so
tight
that
we
were
on
top
of
each
other
i
did
think
that
ange
would
have
fit
in
there
bitch
i
said
looking
at
masha
shut
up
you
should
be
licking
my
boots
thanking
me
you
would
have
ended
up
in
jail
in
a
week
two
tops
not
syria
maybe
i
think
that
where
they
sent
the
ones
they
really
wanted
to
disappear
i
put
my
head
on
my
knees
and
tried
to
breathe
deeply
why
would
you
do
something
so
stupid
as
declaring
war
on
the
dhs
anyway
i
told
her
i
told
her
about
being
busted
and
i
told
her
about
darryl
she
patted
her
pockets
and
came
up
with
a
phone
it
was
charles
wrong
phone
she
came
up
with
another
phone
she
turned
it
on
and
the
glow
from
its
screen
filled
our
little
fort
after
fiddling
for
a
second
she
showed
it
to
me
it
was
the
picture
she
snapped
of
us
just
before
the
bombs
blew
it
was
the
picture
of
jolu
and
van
and
me
and
darryl
i
was
holding
in
my
hand
proof
that
darryl
had
been
with
us
minutes
before
we
all
gone
into
dhs
custody
proof
that
he
been
alive
and
well
and
in
our
company
you
need
to
give
me
a
copy
of
this
i
said
i
need
it
when
we
get
to
la
she
said
snatching
the
phone
back
once
you
been
briefed
on
how
to
be
a
fugitive
without
getting
both
our
asses
caught
and
shipped
to
syria
i
do
want
you
getting
rescue
ideas
about
this
guy
he
safe
enough
where
he
is
for
now
i
thought
about
trying
to
take
it
from
her
by
force
but
she
already
demonstrated
her
physical
skill
she
must
have
been
a
or
something
we
sat
there
in
the
dark
listening
to
the
three
guys
load
the
truck
with
box
after
box
tying
things
down
grunting
with
the
effort
of
it
i
tried
to
sleep
but
could
masha
had
no
such
problem
she
snored
there
was
still
light
shining
through
the
narrow
obstructed
corridor
that
led
to
the
fresh
air
outside
i
stared
at
it
through
the
gloom
and
thought
of
ange
my
ange
her
hair
brushing
her
shoulders
as
she
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
laughing
at
something
i
done
her
face
when
i
seen
her
last
falling
down
in
the
crowd
at
vampmob
all
those
people
at
vampmob
like
the
people
in
the
park
down
and
writhing
the
dhs
moving
in
with
truncheons
the
ones
who
disappeared
darryl
stuck
on
treasure
island
his
side
stitched
up
taken
out
of
his
cell
for
endless
rounds
of
questioning
about
the
terrorists
darryl
father
ruined
and
boozy
unshaven
washed
up
and
in
his
uniform
for
the
photos
weeping
like
a
little
boy
my
own
father
and
the
way
that
he
had
been
changed
by
my
disappearance
to
treasure
island
he
been
just
as
broken
as
darryl
father
but
in
his
own
way
and
his
face
when
i
told
him
where
i
been
that
was
when
i
knew
that
i
could
run
that
was
when
i
knew
that
i
had
to
stay
and
fight
masha
breathing
was
deep
and
regular
but
when
i
reached
with
glacial
slowness
into
her
pocket
for
her
phone
she
snuffled
a
little
and
shifted
i
froze
and
did
even
breathe
for
a
full
two
minutes
counting
one
hippopotami
two
hippopotami
slowly
her
breath
deepened
again
i
tugged
the
phone
free
of
her
one
millimeter
at
a
time
my
fingers
and
arm
trembling
with
the
effort
of
moving
so
slowly
then
i
had
it
a
little
shaped
thing
i
turned
to
head
for
the
light
when
i
had
a
flash
of
memory
charles
holding
out
his
phone
waggling
it
at
us
taunting
us
it
had
been
a
phone
silver
plastered
in
the
logos
of
a
dozen
companies
that
had
subsidized
the
cost
of
the
handset
through
the
phone
company
it
was
the
kind
of
phone
where
you
had
to
listen
to
a
commercial
every
time
you
made
a
call
it
was
too
dim
to
see
the
phone
clearly
in
the
truck
but
i
could
feel
it
were
those
company
decals
on
its
sides
yes
yes
i
had
just
stolen
phone
from
masha
i
turned
back
around
slowly
slowly
and
slowly
slowly
i
reached
back
into
her
pocket
phone
was
bigger
and
bulkier
with
a
better
camera
and
who
knew
what
else
i
been
through
this
once
before
that
made
it
a
little
easier
millimeter
by
millimeter
again
i
teased
it
free
of
her
pocket
stopping
twice
when
she
snuffled
and
twitched
i
had
the
phone
free
of
her
pocket
and
i
was
beginning
to
back
away
when
her
hand
shot
out
fast
as
a
snake
and
grabbed
my
wrist
hard
fingertips
grinding
away
at
the
small
tender
bones
below
my
hand
i
gasped
and
stared
into
masha
staring
eyes
you
are
such
an
idiot
she
said
conversationally
taking
the
phone
from
me
punching
at
its
keypad
with
her
other
hand
how
did
you
plan
on
unlocking
this
again
i
swallowed
i
felt
bones
grind
against
each
other
in
my
wrist
i
bit
my
lip
to
keep
from
crying
out
she
continued
to
punch
away
with
her
other
hand
is
this
what
you
thought
you
get
away
with
she
showed
me
the
picture
of
all
of
us
darryl
and
jolu
van
and
me
this
picture
i
did
say
anything
my
wrist
felt
like
it
would
shatter
maybe
i
should
just
delete
it
take
temptation
out
of
your
way
her
free
hand
moved
some
more
her
phone
asked
her
if
she
was
sure
and
she
had
to
look
at
it
to
find
the
right
button
that
when
i
moved
i
had
charles
phone
in
my
other
hand
still
and
i
brought
it
down
on
her
crushing
hand
as
hard
as
i
could
banging
my
knuckles
on
the
table
overhead
i
hit
her
hand
so
hard
the
phone
shattered
and
she
yelped
and
her
hand
went
slack
i
was
still
moving
reaching
for
her
other
hand
for
her
phone
with
her
thumb
still
poised
over
the
ok
key
her
fingers
spasmed
on
the
empty
air
as
i
snatched
the
phone
out
of
her
hand
i
moved
down
the
narrow
corridor
on
hands
and
knees
heading
for
the
light
i
felt
her
hands
slap
at
my
feet
and
ankles
twice
and
i
had
to
shove
aside
some
of
the
boxes
that
had
walled
us
in
like
a
pharaoh
in
a
tomb
a
few
of
them
fell
down
behind
me
and
i
heard
masha
grunt
again
the
rolling
truck
door
was
open
a
crack
and
i
dove
for
it
slithering
out
under
it
the
steps
had
been
removed
and
i
found
myself
hanging
over
the
road
sliding
headfirst
into
it
clanging
my
head
off
the
blacktop
with
a
thump
that
rang
my
ears
like
a
gong
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
holding
the
bumper
and
desperately
dragged
down
on
the
slamming
it
shut
masha
screamed
inside
i
must
have
caught
her
fingertips
i
felt
like
throwing
up
but
i
did
i
padlocked
the
truck
instead
chapter
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
the
tattered
cover
denver
legendary
independent
bookstore
i
happened
upon
the
tattered
cover
quite
by
accident
alice
and
i
had
just
landed
in
denver
coming
in
from
london
and
it
was
early
and
cold
and
we
needed
coffee
we
drove
in
aimless
circles
and
that
when
i
spotted
it
the
tattered
cover
sign
something
about
it
tingled
in
my
hindbrain
i
knew
i
heard
of
this
place
we
pulled
in
got
a
coffee
and
stepped
into
the
store
a
wonderland
of
dark
wood
homey
reading
nooks
and
miles
and
miles
of
bookshelves
the
tattered
cover
http
denver
co
usa
none
of
the
three
guys
were
around
at
the
moment
so
i
took
off
my
head
hurt
so
much
i
thought
i
must
be
bleeding
but
my
hands
came
away
dry
my
twisted
ankle
had
frozen
up
in
the
truck
so
that
i
ran
like
a
broken
marionette
and
i
stopped
only
once
to
cancel
the
on
masha
phone
i
turned
off
its
radio
both
to
save
battery
and
to
keep
it
from
being
used
to
track
me
and
set
the
sleep
timer
to
two
hours
the
longest
setting
available
i
tried
to
set
it
to
not
require
a
password
to
wake
from
sleep
but
that
required
a
password
itself
i
was
just
going
to
have
to
tap
the
keypad
at
least
once
every
two
hours
until
i
could
figure
out
how
to
get
the
photo
off
of
the
phone
i
would
need
a
charger
then
i
did
have
a
plan
i
needed
one
i
needed
to
sit
down
to
get
online
to
figure
out
what
i
was
going
to
do
next
i
was
sick
of
letting
other
people
do
my
planning
for
me
i
did
want
to
be
acting
because
of
what
masha
did
or
because
of
the
dhs
or
because
of
my
dad
or
because
of
ange
well
maybe
i
act
because
of
ange
that
would
be
just
fine
in
fact
i
just
been
slipping
downhill
taking
alleys
when
i
could
merging
with
the
tenderloin
crowds
i
did
have
any
destination
in
mind
every
few
minutes
i
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
nudged
one
of
the
keys
on
masha
phone
to
keep
it
from
going
asleep
it
made
an
awkward
bulge
unfolded
there
in
my
jacket
i
stopped
and
leaned
against
a
building
my
ankle
was
killing
me
where
was
i
anyway
at
hyde
street
in
front
of
a
dodgy
asian
massage
parlor
my
traitorous
feet
had
taken
me
right
back
to
the
beginning
taken
me
back
to
where
the
photo
on
masha
phone
had
been
taken
seconds
before
the
bay
bridge
blew
before
my
life
changed
forever
i
wanted
to
sit
down
on
the
sidewalk
and
bawl
but
that
would
solve
my
problems
i
had
to
call
barbara
stratford
tell
her
what
had
happened
show
her
the
photo
of
darryl
what
was
i
thinking
i
had
to
show
her
the
video
the
one
that
masha
had
sent
me
the
one
where
the
president
chief
of
staff
gloated
at
the
attacks
on
san
francisco
and
admitted
that
he
knew
when
and
where
the
next
attacks
would
happen
and
that
he
would
stop
them
because
they
help
his
man
get
that
was
a
plan
then
get
in
touch
with
barbara
give
her
the
documents
and
get
them
into
print
the
vampmob
had
to
have
really
freaked
people
out
made
them
think
that
we
really
were
a
bunch
of
terrorists
of
course
when
i
been
planning
it
i
had
been
thinking
of
how
good
a
distraction
it
would
be
not
how
it
would
look
to
some
nascar
dad
in
nebraska
i
call
barbara
and
i
do
it
smart
from
a
payphone
putting
my
hood
up
so
that
the
inevitable
cctv
would
get
a
photo
of
me
i
dug
a
quarter
out
of
my
pocket
and
polished
it
on
my
getting
the
fingerprints
off
it
i
headed
downhill
down
and
down
to
the
bart
station
and
the
payphones
there
i
made
it
to
the
stop
when
i
spotted
the
cover
of
the
week
stacked
in
a
high
pile
next
to
a
homeless
black
guy
who
smiled
at
me
go
ahead
and
read
the
cover
it
free
it
cost
you
fifty
cents
to
look
inside
though
the
headline
was
set
in
the
biggest
type
i
seen
since
inside
beneath
it
in
slightly
smaller
type
how
the
dhs
has
kept
our
children
and
friends
in
secret
prisons
on
our
doorstep
by
barbara
stratford
special
to
the
bay
guardian
the
newspaper
seller
shook
his
head
can
you
believe
that
he
said
right
here
in
san
francisco
man
the
government
theoretically
the
was
free
but
this
guy
appeared
to
have
cornered
the
local
market
for
copies
of
it
i
had
a
quarter
in
my
hand
i
dropped
it
into
his
cup
and
fished
for
another
one
i
did
bother
polishing
the
fingerprints
off
of
it
this
time
we
told
that
the
world
changed
forever
when
the
bay
bridge
was
blown
up
by
parties
unknown
thousands
of
our
friends
and
neighbors
died
on
that
day
almost
none
of
them
have
been
recovered
their
remains
are
presumed
to
be
resting
in
the
city
harbor
but
an
extraordinary
story
told
to
this
reporter
by
a
young
man
who
was
arrested
by
the
dhs
minutes
after
the
explosion
suggests
that
our
own
government
has
illegally
held
many
of
those
thought
dead
on
treasure
island
which
had
been
evacuated
and
declared
to
civilians
shortly
after
the
bombing
i
sat
down
on
a
bench
the
same
bench
i
noted
with
a
prickly
feeling
where
we
rested
darryl
after
escaping
from
the
bart
station
and
read
the
article
all
the
way
through
it
took
a
huge
effort
not
to
burst
into
tears
right
there
barbara
had
found
some
photos
of
me
and
darryl
goofing
around
together
and
they
ran
alongside
the
text
the
photos
were
maybe
a
year
old
but
i
looked
so
much
in
them
like
i
was
or
i
done
a
lot
of
growing
up
in
the
past
couple
months
the
piece
was
beautifully
written
i
kept
feeling
outraged
on
behalf
of
the
poor
kids
she
was
writing
about
then
remembering
that
she
was
writing
about
zeb
note
was
there
his
crabbed
handwriting
reproduced
in
large
a
of
the
newspaper
barbara
had
dug
up
more
info
on
other
kids
who
were
missing
and
presumed
dead
a
long
list
and
asked
how
many
had
been
stuck
there
on
the
island
just
a
few
miles
from
their
parents
doorsteps
i
dug
another
quarter
out
of
my
pocket
then
changed
my
mind
what
was
the
chance
that
barbara
phone
was
tapped
there
was
no
way
i
was
going
to
be
able
to
call
her
now
not
directly
i
needed
some
intermediary
to
get
in
touch
with
her
and
get
her
to
meet
me
somewhere
south
so
much
for
plans
what
i
really
really
needed
was
the
xnet
how
the
hell
was
i
going
to
get
online
my
phone
wifinder
was
blinking
like
crazy
there
was
wireless
all
around
me
but
i
did
have
an
xbox
and
a
tv
and
a
paranoidxbox
dvd
to
boot
from
wifi
wifi
everywhere
that
when
i
spotted
them
two
kids
about
my
age
moving
among
the
crowd
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
down
into
the
bart
what
caught
my
eye
was
the
way
they
were
moving
kind
of
clumsy
nudging
up
against
the
commuters
and
the
tourists
each
had
a
hand
in
his
pocket
and
whenever
they
met
one
another
eye
they
snickered
they
could
have
been
more
obvious
jammers
but
the
crowd
was
oblivious
to
them
being
down
in
that
neighborhood
you
expect
to
be
dodging
homeless
people
and
crazies
so
you
do
make
eye
contact
do
look
around
at
all
if
you
can
help
it
i
sidled
up
to
one
he
seemed
really
young
but
he
could
have
been
any
younger
than
me
hey
i
said
hey
can
you
guys
come
over
here
for
a
second
he
pretended
not
to
hear
me
he
looked
right
through
me
the
way
you
would
a
homeless
person
come
on
i
said
i
do
have
a
lot
of
time
i
grabbed
his
shoulder
and
hissed
in
his
ear
the
cops
are
after
me
i
from
xnet
he
looked
scared
now
like
he
wanted
to
run
away
and
his
friend
was
moving
toward
us
i
serious
i
said
just
hear
me
out
his
friend
came
over
he
was
taller
and
beefy
like
darryl
hey
he
said
something
wrong
his
friend
whispered
in
his
ear
the
two
of
them
looked
like
they
were
going
to
bolt
i
grabbed
my
copy
of
the
from
under
my
arm
and
rattled
it
in
front
of
them
just
turn
to
page
ok
they
did
they
looked
at
the
headline
the
photo
me
oh
dude
the
first
one
said
we
are
not
worthy
he
grinned
at
me
like
crazy
and
the
beefier
one
slapped
me
on
the
back
no
he
said
you
m
i
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
come
over
here
ok
i
brought
them
back
to
my
bench
i
noticed
that
there
was
something
old
and
brown
staining
the
sidewalk
underneath
it
darryl
blood
it
made
my
skin
pucker
up
we
sat
down
i
marcus
i
said
swallowing
hard
as
i
gave
my
real
name
to
these
two
who
already
knew
me
as
i
was
blowing
my
cover
but
the
had
already
made
the
connection
for
me
nate
the
small
one
said
liam
the
bigger
one
said
dude
it
is
an
honor
to
meet
you
you
like
our
hero
do
say
that
i
said
do
say
that
you
two
are
like
a
flashing
advertisement
that
says
am
jamming
please
put
my
ass
in
you
could
be
more
obvious
liam
looked
like
he
might
cry
do
worry
you
did
get
busted
i
give
you
some
tips
later
he
brightened
up
again
what
was
becoming
weirdly
clear
was
that
these
two
really
idolize
and
that
they
do
anything
i
said
they
were
grinning
like
idiots
it
made
me
uncomfortable
sick
to
my
stomach
listen
i
need
to
get
on
xnet
now
without
going
home
or
anywhere
near
home
do
you
two
live
near
here
i
do
nate
said
up
at
the
top
of
california
street
it
a
bit
of
a
walk
steep
hills
i
just
walked
all
the
way
down
them
masha
was
somewhere
up
there
but
still
it
was
better
than
i
had
any
right
to
expect
let
go
i
said
nate
loaned
me
his
baseball
hat
and
traded
jackets
with
me
i
did
have
to
worry
about
not
with
my
ankle
throbbing
the
way
it
was
i
limped
like
an
extra
in
a
cowboy
movie
nate
lived
in
a
huge
apartment
at
the
top
of
nob
hill
the
building
had
a
doorman
in
a
red
overcoat
with
gold
brocade
and
he
touched
his
cap
and
called
nate
mr
nate
and
welcomed
us
all
there
the
place
was
spotless
and
smelled
of
furniture
polish
i
tried
not
to
gawp
at
what
must
have
been
a
couple
million
bucks
worth
of
condo
my
dad
he
explained
he
was
an
investment
banker
lots
of
life
insurance
he
died
when
i
was
and
we
got
it
all
they
been
divorced
for
years
but
he
left
my
mom
as
beneficiary
from
the
window
you
could
see
a
stunning
view
of
the
other
side
of
nob
hill
all
the
way
down
to
fisherman
wharf
to
the
ugly
stub
of
the
bay
bridge
the
crowd
of
cranes
and
trucks
through
the
mist
i
could
just
make
out
treasure
island
looking
down
all
that
way
it
gave
me
a
crazy
urge
to
jump
i
got
online
with
his
xbox
and
a
huge
plasma
screen
in
the
living
room
he
showed
me
how
many
open
wifi
networks
were
visible
from
his
high
vantage
point
twenty
thirty
of
them
this
was
a
good
spot
to
be
an
xnetter
there
was
a
of
email
in
my
account
new
messages
since
ange
and
i
had
left
her
place
that
morning
lots
of
it
was
from
the
press
asking
for
followup
interviews
but
most
of
it
was
from
the
xnetters
people
who
seen
the
story
and
wanted
to
tell
me
that
they
do
anything
to
help
me
anything
i
needed
that
did
it
tears
started
to
roll
down
my
cheeks
nate
and
liam
exchanged
glances
i
tried
to
stop
but
it
was
no
good
i
was
sobbing
now
nate
went
to
an
oak
on
one
wall
and
swung
a
bar
out
of
one
of
its
shelves
revealing
gleaming
rows
of
bottles
he
poured
me
a
shot
of
something
golden
brown
and
brought
it
to
me
rare
irish
whiskey
he
said
mom
favorite
it
tasted
like
fire
like
gold
i
sipped
at
it
trying
not
to
choke
i
did
really
like
hard
liquor
but
this
was
different
i
took
several
deep
breaths
thanks
nate
i
said
he
looked
like
i
just
pinned
a
medal
on
him
he
was
a
good
kid
all
right
i
said
and
picked
up
the
keyboard
the
two
boys
watched
in
fascination
as
i
paged
through
my
mail
on
the
gigantic
screen
what
i
was
looking
for
first
and
foremost
was
email
from
ange
there
was
a
chance
that
she
just
gotten
away
there
was
always
that
chance
i
was
an
idiot
to
even
hope
there
was
nothing
from
her
i
started
going
through
the
mail
as
fast
as
i
could
picking
apart
the
press
requests
the
fan
mail
the
hate
mail
the
spam
and
that
when
i
found
it
a
letter
from
zeb
it
was
nice
to
wake
up
this
morning
and
find
the
letter
that
i
thought
you
would
destroy
in
the
pages
of
the
newspaper
not
nice
at
all
made
me
feel
hunted
but
i
come
to
understand
why
you
did
it
i
do
know
if
i
can
approve
of
your
tactics
but
it
easy
to
see
that
your
motives
were
sound
if
you
reading
this
that
means
that
there
a
good
chance
you
gone
underground
it
not
easy
i
been
learning
that
i
been
learning
a
lot
more

can
help
you
i
should
do
that
for
you
you
doing
what
you
can
for
me
even
if

not
doing
it

my
permission

the
run
and

or

by
our
friends

for
a
way
to
make
the
pain

do
what
they
tell
you
i
know
that
i

that
risk
for
you
wooooah
liam
breathed
duuuuude
i
wanted
to
smack
him
i
turned
to
say
something
awful
and
cutting
to
him
but
he
was
staring
at
me
with
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
looking
like
he
wanted
to
drop
to
his
knees
and
worship
me
can
i
just
say
nate
said
can
i
just
say
that
it
is
the
biggest
honor
of
my
entire
life
to
help
you
can
i
just
say
that
i
was
blushing
now
there
was
nothing
for
it
these
two
were
totally
even
though
i
was
any
kind
of
star
not
in
my
own
mind
at
least
can
you
guys
i
swallowed
can
i
have
some
privacy
here
they
slunk
out
of
the
room
like
bad
puppies
and
i
felt
like
a
tool
i
typed
fast
i
got
away
zeb
and
i
on
the
run
i
need
all
the
help
i
can
get
i
want
to
end
this
now
i
remembered
to
take
masha
phone
out
of
my
pocket
and
tickle
it
to
keep
it
from
going
to
sleep
they
let
me
use
the
shower
gave
me
a
change
of
clothes
a
new
backpack
with
half
their
earthquake
kit
in
it
energy
bars
medicine
hot
and
cold
packs
and
an
old
they
even
slipped
a
spare
xbox
universal
already
loaded
with
paranoidxbox
on
it
into
there
that
was
a
nice
touch
i
had
to
draw
the
line
at
a
flaregun
i
kept
on
checking
my
email
to
see
if
zeb
had
replied
i
answered
the
fan
mail
i
answered
the
mail
from
the
press
i
deleted
the
hate
mail
i
was
to
see
something
from
masha
but
chances
were
she
was
halfway
to
la
by
now
her
fingers
hurt
and
in
no
position
to
type
i
tickled
her
phone
again
they
encouraged
me
to
take
a
nap
and
for
a
brief
shameful
moment
i
got
all
paranoid
like
maybe
these
guys
were
thinking
of
turning
me
in
once
i
was
asleep
which
was
idiotic
they
could
have
turned
me
in
just
as
easily
when
i
was
awake
i
just
could
compute
the
fact
that
they
thought
of
me
i
had
known
intellectually
that
there
were
people
who
would
follow
i
met
some
of
those
people
that
morning
shouting
bite
bite
bite
and
vamping
it
up
at
civic
center
but
these
two
were
more
personal
they
were
just
nice
goofy
guys
they
coulda
been
any
of
my
friends
back
in
the
days
before
the
xnet
just
two
pals
who
palled
around
having
teenage
adventures
they
volunteered
to
join
an
army
my
army
i
had
a
responsibility
to
them
left
to
themselves
they
get
caught
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
they
were
too
trusting
guys
listen
to
me
for
a
second
i
have
something
serious
i
need
to
talk
to
you
about
they
almost
stood
at
attention
it
would
have
been
funny
if
it
was
so
scary
here
the
thing
now
that
you
helped
me
it
really
dangerous
if
you
get
caught
i
get
caught
they
get
anything
you
know
out
of
you
i
held
up
my
hand
to
forestall
their
protests
no
stop
you
have
been
through
it
everyone
talks
everyone
breaks
if
you
ever
caught
you
tell
them
everything
right
away
as
fast
as
you
can
as
much
as
you
can
they
get
it
all
eventually
anyway
that
how
they
work
but
you
wo
get
caught
and
here
why
you
not
jammers
anymore
you
are
retired
from
active
duty
you
a
i
fished
in
my
memory
for
vocabulary
words
culled
from
spy
thrillers
you
a
sleeper
cell
stand
down
go
back
to
being
normal
kids
one
way
or
another
i
going
to
break
this
thing
break
it
wide
open
end
it
or
it
will
get
me
finally
do
me
in
if
you
do
hear
from
me
within
hours
assume
that
they
got
me
do
whatever
you
want
then
but
for
the
next
three
days
and
forever
if
i
do
what
i
trying
to
do
stand
down
will
you
promise
me
that
they
promised
with
all
solemnity
i
let
them
talk
me
into
napping
but
made
them
swear
to
rouse
me
once
an
hour
i
have
to
tickle
masha
phone
and
i
wanted
to
know
as
soon
as
zeb
got
back
in
touch
with
me
the
rendezvous
was
on
a
bart
car
which
made
me
nervous
they
full
of
cameras
but
zeb
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
me
meet
him
in
the
last
car
of
a
certain
train
departing
from
powell
street
station
at
a
time
when
that
car
was
filled
with
the
press
of
bodies
he
sidled
up
to
me
in
the
crowd
and
the
good
commuters
of
san
francisco
cleared
a
space
for
him
the
hollow
that
always
surrounds
homeless
people
nice
to
see
you
again
he
muttered
facing
into
the
doorway
looking
into
the
dark
glass
i
could
see
that
there
was
no
one
close
enough
to
eavesdrop
not
without
some
kind
of
mic
rig
and
if
they
knew
enough
to
show
up
here
with
one
of
those
we
were
dead
anyway
you
too
brother
i
said
i
i
sorry
you
know
shut
up
do
be
sorry
you
were
braver
than
i
am
are
you
ready
to
go
underground
now
ready
to
disappear
about
that
yes
that
not
the
plan
oh
he
said
listen
ok
i
have
i
have
pictures
video
stuff
that
really
something
i
reached
into
my
pocket
and
tickled
masha
phone
i
bought
a
charger
for
it
in
union
square
on
the
way
down
and
had
stopped
and
plugged
it
in
at
a
cafe
for
long
enough
to
get
the
battery
up
to
four
out
of
five
bars
i
need
to
get
it
to
barbara
stratford
the
woman
from
the
but
they
going
to
be
watching
her
watching
to
see
if
i
show
up
you
do
think
that
they
be
watching
for
me
too
if
your
plan
involves
me
going
within
a
mile
of
that
woman
home
or
office
i
want
you
to
get
van
to
come
and
meet
me
did
darryl
ever
tell
you
about
van
the
girl
he
told
me
yes
he
told
me
you
do
think
they
be
watching
her
all
of
you
who
were
arrested
i
think
they
will
i
do
think
they
be
watching
her
as
hard
and
van
has
totally
clean
hands
she
never
cooperated
with
any
of
my
i
swallowed
with
my
projects
so
they
might
be
a
little
more
relaxed
about
her
if
she
calls
the
bay
guardian
to
make
an
appointment
to
explain
why
i
just
full
of
crap
maybe
they
let
her
keep
it
he
stared
at
the
door
for
a
long
time
you
know
what
happens
when
they
catch
us
again
it
was
a
question
i
nodded
are
you
sure
some
of
the
people
that
were
on
treasure
island
with
us
got
taken
away
in
helicopters
they
got
taken
there
are
countries
where
america
can
outsource
its
torture
countries
where
you
will
rot
forever
countries
where
you
wish
they
would
just
get
it
over
with
have
you
dig
a
trench
and
then
shoot
you
in
the
back
of
the
head
as
you
stand
over
it
i
swallowed
and
nodded
is
it
worth
the
risk
we
can
go
underground
for
a
long
long
time
here
someday
we
might
get
our
country
back
we
can
wait
it
out
i
shook
my
head
you
ca
get
anything
done
by
doing
nothing
it
our
they
taken
it
from
us
the
terrorists
who
attack
us
are
still
free
but
i
ca
go
underground
for
a
year
ten
years
my
whole
life
waiting
for
freedom
to
be
handed
to
me
freedom
is
something
you
have
to
take
for
yourself
that
afternoon
van
left
school
as
usual
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
bus
with
a
tight
knot
of
her
friends
laughing
and
joking
the
way
she
always
did
the
other
riders
on
the
bus
took
special
note
of
her
she
was
so
loud
and
besides
she
was
wearing
that
stupid
giant
floppy
hat
something
that
looked
like
a
piece
out
of
a
school
play
about
renaissance
sword
fighters
at
one
point
they
all
huddled
together
then
turned
away
to
look
out
the
back
of
the
bus
pointing
and
giggling
the
girl
who
wore
the
hat
now
was
the
same
height
as
van
and
from
behind
it
could
be
her
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
mousy
little
asian
girl
who
got
off
a
few
stops
before
the
bart
she
was
dressed
in
a
plain
old
school
uniform
and
looking
down
shyly
as
she
stepped
off
besides
at
that
moment
the
loud
korean
girl
let
out
a
whoop
and
her
friends
followed
along
laughing
so
loudly
that
even
the
bus
driver
slowed
down
twisted
in
his
seat
and
gave
them
a
dirty
look
van
hurried
away
down
the
street
with
her
head
down
her
hair
tied
back
and
dropped
down
the
collar
of
her
bubble
jacket
she
had
slipped
lifts
into
her
shoes
that
made
her
two
wobbly
awkward
inches
taller
and
had
taken
her
contacts
out
and
put
on
her
glasses
with
huge
lenses
that
took
up
half
her
face
although
i
been
waiting
in
the
for
her
and
knew
when
to
expect
her
i
hardly
recognized
her
i
got
up
and
walked
along
behind
her
across
the
street
trailing
by
half
a
block
the
people
who
passed
me
looked
away
as
quickly
as
possible
i
looked
like
a
homeless
kid
with
a
grubby
cardboard
sign
overcoat
huge
overstuffed
knapsack
with
over
its
rips
no
one
wants
to
look
at
a
because
if
you
meet
his
eye
he
might
ask
you
for
some
spare
change
i
walked
around
oakland
all
afternoon
and
the
only
person
who
spoken
to
me
was
a
jehovah
witness
and
a
scientologist
both
trying
to
convert
me
it
felt
gross
like
being
hit
on
by
a
pervert
van
followed
the
directions
i
written
down
carefully
zeb
had
passed
them
to
her
the
same
way
he
given
me
the
note
outside
school
bumping
into
her
as
she
waited
for
the
bus
apologizing
profusely
i
written
the
note
plainly
and
simply
just
laying
it
out
for
her
i
know
you
do
approve
i
understand
but
this
is
it
this
is
the
most
important
favor
i
ever
asked
of
you
please
please
she
come
i
knew
she
would
we
had
a
lot
of
history
van
and
i
she
did
like
what
had
happened
to
the
world
either
besides
an
evil
chuckling
voice
in
my
head
had
pointed
out
she
was
under
suspicion
now
that
barbara
article
was
out
we
walked
like
that
for
six
or
seven
blocks
looking
at
who
was
near
us
what
cars
went
past
zeb
told
me
about
trails
where
five
different
undercovers
traded
off
duties
following
you
making
it
nearly
impossible
to
spot
them
you
had
to
go
somewhere
totally
desolate
where
anyone
at
all
would
stand
out
like
a
sore
thumb
the
overpass
for
the
was
just
a
few
blocks
from
the
coliseum
bart
station
and
even
with
all
the
circling
van
did
it
did
take
long
to
reach
it
the
noise
from
overhead
was
nearly
deafening
no
one
else
was
around
not
that
i
could
tell
i
visited
the
site
before
i
suggested
it
to
van
in
the
note
taking
care
to
check
for
places
where
someone
could
hide
there
were
any
once
she
stopped
at
the
appointed
place
i
moved
quickly
to
catch
up
to
her
she
blinked
owlishly
at
me
from
behind
her
glasses
marcus
she
breathed
and
tears
swam
in
her
eyes
i
found
that
i
was
crying
too
i
make
a
really
rotten
fugitive
too
sentimental
she
hugged
me
so
hard
i
could
breathe
i
hugged
her
back
even
harder
then
she
kissed
me
not
on
the
cheek
not
like
a
sister
full
on
the
lips
a
hot
wet
steamy
kiss
that
seemed
to
go
on
forever
i
was
so
overcome
with
emotion
no
that
bull
i
knew
exactly
what
i
was
doing
i
kissed
her
back
then
i
stopped
and
pulled
away
nearly
shoved
her
away
van
i
gasped
oops
she
said
van
i
said
again
sorry
she
said
i
something
occurred
to
me
just
then
something
i
guess
i
should
have
seen
a
long
long
time
before
you
me
do
you
she
nodded
miserably
for
years
she
said
oh
god
darryl
all
these
years
so
in
love
with
her
and
the
whole
time
she
was
looking
at
me
secretly
wanting
me
and
then
i
ended
up
with
ange
ange
said
that
she
always
fought
with
van
and
i
was
running
around
getting
into
so
much
trouble
van
i
said
van
i
so
sorry
forget
it
she
said
looking
away
i
know
it
ca
be
i
just
wanted
to
do
that
once
just
in
case
i
never
she
bit
down
on
the
words
van
i
need
you
to
do
something
for
me
something
important
i
need
you
to
meet
with
the
journalist
from
the
bay
guardian
barbara
stratford
the
one
who
wrote
the
article
i
need
you
to
give
her
something
i
explained
about
masha
phone
told
her
about
the
video
that
masha
had
sent
me
what
good
will
this
do
marcus
what
the
point
van
you
were
right
at
least
partly
we
ca
fix
the
world
by
putting
other
people
at
risk
i
need
to
solve
the
problem
by
telling
what
i
know
i
should
have
done
that
from
the
start
should
have
walked
straight
out
of
their
custody
and
to
darryl
father
house
and
told
him
what
i
knew
now
though
i
have
evidence
this
stuff
it
could
change
the
world
this
is
my
last
hope
the
only
hope
for
getting
darryl
out
for
getting
a
life
that
i
do
spend
underground
hiding
from
the
cops
and
you
the
only
person
i
can
trust
to
do
this
why
me
you
kidding
right
look
at
how
well
you
handled
getting
here
you
a
pro
you
the
best
at
this
of
any
of
us

only
one
i
can
trust
that
why
you
why
not
your
friend
angie
she
said
the
name
without
any
inflection
at
all
like
it
was
a
block
of
cement
i
looked
down
i
thought
you
knew
they
arrested
her
she
in
gitmo
on
treasure
island
she
been
there
for
days
now
i
had
been
trying
not
to
think
about
this
not
to
think
about
what
might
be
happening
to
her
now
i
could
stop
myself
and
i
started
to
sob
i
felt
a
pain
in
my
stomach
like
i
been
kicked
and
i
pushed
my
hands
into
my
middle
to
hold
myself
in
i
folded
there
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
on
my
side
in
the
rubble
under
the
freeway
holding
myself
and
crying
van
knelt
down
by
my
side
give
me
the
phone
she
said
her
voice
an
angry
hiss
i
fished
it
out
of
my
pocket
and
passed
it
to
her
embarrassed
i
stopped
crying
and
sat
up
i
knew
that
snot
was
running
down
my
face
van
was
giving
me
a
look
of
pure
revulsion
you
need
to
keep
it
from
going
to
sleep
i
said
i
have
a
charger
here
i
rummaged
in
my
pack
i
had
slept
all
the
way
through
the
night
since
i
acquired
it
i
set
the
phone
alarm
to
go
off
every
minutes
and
wake
me
up
so
that
i
could
keep
it
from
going
to
sleep
do
fold
it
shut
either
and
the
video
that
harder
i
said
i
emailed
a
copy
to
myself
but
i
ca
get
onto
the
xnet
anymore
in
a
pinch
i
could
have
gone
back
to
nate
and
liam
and
used
their
xbox
again
but
i
did
want
to
risk
it
look
i
going
to
give
you
my
login
and
password
for
the
pirate
party

have
to
use
tor
to
access
it
homeland
security

bound
to
be
scanning
for

logging
into
mail

she
said
looking
a
little
surprised
i
trust
you
van
i
know
i
can
trust
you
she
shook
her
head
you
give
out
your
passwords

anymore
either
you

or
i
or
it
the
end
of
marcus
yallow
maybe
i
get
a
new
identity

i
do
think

think

guess

all
along
that
they
catch
me
some
day
she
looked
at
me
furious
now
what
a
waste
what
was
it
all
for
anyway
of
all
the
things
she
could
have
said
nothing
could
have
hurt
me
more
it
was
like
another
kick
in
the
stomach
what
a
waste
all
of
it
futile
darryl
and
ange
gone
i
might
never
see
my
family
again
and
still
homeland
security
had
my
city
and
my
country
caught
in
a
massive
irrational
shrieking
where
anything
could
be
done
in
the
name
of
stopping
terrorism
van
looked
like
she
was
waiting
for
me
to
say
something
but
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
she
left
me
there
zeb
had
a
pizza
for
me
when
i
got
back
home
to
the
tent
under
a
freeway
overpass
in
the
mission
that
he
staked
out
for
the
night
he
had
a
pup
tent
military
surplus
stenciled
with
san
francisco
local
homeless
coordinating
board
the
pizza
was
a
dominos
cold
and
clabbered
but
delicious
for
all
that
you
like
pineapple
on
your
pizza
zeb
smiled
condescendingly
at
me
freegans
ca
be
choosy
he
said
freegans
like
vegans
but
we
only
eat
free
food
free
food
he
grinned
again
you
know
food
from
the
free
food
store
you
stole
this
no
dummy
it
from
the
other
store
the
little
one
out
behind
the
store
made
of
blue
steel
kind
of
funky
smelling
you
got
this
out
of
the
garbage
he
flung
his
head
back
and
cackled
yes
indeedy
you
should
your
face
dude
it
ok
it
not
like
it
was
rotten
it
was
fresh
just
a
screwed
up
order
they
threw
it
out
in
the
box
they
sprinkle
rat
poison
over
everything
at
but
if
you
get
there
quick
you
you
should
see
what
grocery
stores
throw
out
wait
until
breakfast
i
going
to
make
you
a
fruit
salad
you
wo
believe
as
soon
as
one
strawberry
in
the
box
goes
a
little
green
and
fuzzy
the
whole
thing
is
out
i
tuned
him
out
the
pizza
was
fine
it
was
as
if
sitting
in
the
dumpster
would
infect
it
or
something
if
it
was
gross
that
was
only
because
it
came
from
domino
the
worst
pizza
in
town
i
never
liked
their
food
and
i
given
it
up
altogether
when
i
found
out
that
they
bankrolled
a
bunch
of
politicians
who
thought
that
global
warming
and
evolution
were
satanic
plots
it
was
hard
to
shake
the
feeling
of
grossness
though
but
there
another
way
to
look
at
it
zeb
had
showed
me
a
secret
something
i
had
anticipated
there
was
a
whole
hidden
world
out
there
a
way
of
getting
by
without
participating
in
the
system
freegans
huh
yogurt
too
he
said
nodding
vigorously
for
the
fruit
salad
they
throw
it
out
the
day
after
the
date
but
it
not
as
if
it
goes
green
at
midnight
it
yogurt
i
mean
it
basically
just
rotten
milk
to
begin
with
i
swallowed
the
pizza
tasted
funny
rat
poison
spoiled
yogurt
furry
strawberries
this
would
take
some
getting
used
to
i
ate
another
bite
actually
domino
pizza
sucked
a
little
less
when
you
got
it
for
free
liam
sleeping
bag
was
warm
and
welcoming
after
a
long
emotionally
exhausting
day
van
would
have
made
contact
with
barbara
by
now
she
have
the
video
and
the
picture
i
call
her
in
the
morning
and
find
out
what
she
thought
i
should
do
next
i
have
to
come
in
once
she
published
to
back
it
all
up
i
thought
about
that
as
i
closed
my
eyes
thought
about
what
it
would
be
like
to
turn
myself
in
the
cameras
all
rolling
following
the
infamous
into
one
of
those
big
columnated
buildings
in
civic
center
the
sound
of
the
cars
screaming
by
overhead
turned
into
a
kind
of
ocean
sound
as
i
drifted
away
there
were
other
tents
nearby
homeless
people
i
met
a
few
of
them
that
afternoon
before
it
got
dark
and
we
all
retreated
to
huddle
near
our
own
tents
they
were
all
older
than
me
rough
looking
and
gruff
none
of
them
looked
crazy
or
violent
though
just
like
people
who
had
bad
luck
or
made
bad
decisions
or
both
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
because
i
do
remember
anything
else
until
a
bright
light
was
shined
into
my
face
so
bright
it
was
blinding
that
him
said
a
voice
behind
the
light
bag
him
said
another
voice
one
i
heard
before
one
i
heard
over
and
over
again
in
my
dreams
lecturing
to
me
demanding
my
passwords
the
bag
went
over
my
head
quickly
and
was
cinched
so
tight
at
the
throat
that
i
choked
and
threw
up
my
freegan
pizza
as
i
spasmed
and
choked
hard
hands
bound
my
wrists
then
my
ankles
i
was
rolled
onto
a
stretcher
and
hoisted
then
carried
into
a
vehicle
up
a
couple
of
clanging
metal
steps
they
dropped
me
into
a
padded
floor
there
was
no
sound
at
all
in
the
back
of
the
vehicle
once
they
closed
the
doors
the
padding
deadened
everything
except
my
own
choking
well
hello
again
she
said
i
felt
the
van
rock
as
she
crawled
in
with
me
i
was
still
choking
trying
to
gasp
in
a
breath
vomit
filled
my
mouth
and
trickled
down
my
windpipe
we
wo
let
you
die
she
said
if
you
stop
breathing
we
make
sure
you
start
again
so
do
worry
about
it
i
choked
harder
i
sipped
at
air
some
was
getting
through
deep
wracking
coughs
shook
my
chest
and
back
dislodging
some
more
of
the
puke
more
breath
see
she
said
not
so
bad
welcome
home
we
got
somewhere
very
special
to
take
you
i
relaxed
onto
my
back
feeling
the
van
rock
the
smell
of
used
pizza
was
overwhelming
at
first
but
as
with
all
strong
stimuli
my
brain
gradually
grew
accustomed
to
it
filtered
it
out
until
it
was
just
a
faint
aroma
the
rocking
of
the
van
was
almost
comforting
that
when
it
happened
an
incredible
deep
calm
that
swept
over
me
like
i
was
lying
on
the
beach
and
the
ocean
had
swept
in
and
lifted
me
as
gently
as
a
parent
held
me
aloft
and
swept
me
out
onto
a
warm
sea
under
a
warm
sun
after
everything
that
had
happened
i
was
caught
but
it
did
matter
i
had
gotten
the
information
to
barbara
i
had
organized
the
xnet
i
had
won
and
if
i
had
won
i
had
done
everything
i
could
have
done
more
than
i
ever
thought
i
could
do
i
took
a
mental
inventory
as
i
rode
thinking
of
everything
that
i
had
accomplished
that
had
accomplished
the
city
the
country
the
world
was
full
of
people
who
would
live
the
way
dhs
wanted
us
to
live
we
fight
forever
they
could
jail
us
all
i
sighed
and
smiled
she
been
talking
all
along
i
realized
i
been
so
far
into
my
happy
place
that
she
just
gone
smart
kid
like
you
you
think
that
you
know
better
than
to
mess
with
us
we
had
an
eye
on
you
since
the
day
you
walked
out
we
would
have
caught
you
even
if
you
had
gone
crying
to
your
lesbo
journalist
traitor
i
just
do
get
it
we
had
an
understanding
you
and
me
we
rumbled
over
a
metal
plate
the
van
shocks
rocking
and
then
the
rocking
changed
we
were
on
water
heading
to
treasure
island
hey
ange
was
there
darryl
too
maybe
the
hood
did
come
off
until
i
was
in
my
cell
they
did
bother
with
the
cuffs
at
my
wrists
and
ankles
just
rolled
me
off
the
stretcher
and
onto
the
floor
it
was
dark
but
by
the
moonlight
from
the
single
tiny
high
window
i
could
see
that
the
mattress
had
been
taken
off
the
cot
the
room
contained
me
a
toilet
a
and
a
sink
and
nothing
else
i
closed
my
eyes
and
let
the
ocean
lift
me
i
floated
away
somewhere
far
below
me
was
my
body
i
could
tell
what
would
happen
next
i
was
being
left
to
piss
myself
again
i
knew
what
that
was
like
i
pissed
myself
before
it
smelled
bad
it
itched
it
was
humiliating
like
being
a
baby
but
i
survived
it
i
laughed
the
sound
was
weird
and
it
drew
me
back
into
my
body
back
to
the
present
i
laughed
and
laughed
i
had
the
worst
that
they
could
throw
at
me
and
i
survived
it
and
i
beaten
them
for
months
showed
them
up
as
chumps
and
despots
i
i
let
my
bladder
cut
loose
it
was
sore
and
full
anyway
and
no
time
like
the
present
the
ocean
swept
me
away
when
morning
came
two
efficient
impersonal
guards
cut
the
bindings
off
of
my
wrists
and
ankles
i
still
could
walk
when
i
stood
my
legs
gave
way
like
a
stringless
marionette
too
much
time
in
one
position
the
guards
pulled
my
arms
over
their
shoulders
and
me
down
the
familiar
corridor
the
bar
codes
on
the
doors
were
curling
up
and
dangling
now
attacked
by
the
salt
air
i
got
an
idea
ange
i
yelled
darryl
i
yelled
my
guards
yanked
me
along
faster
clearly
disturbed
but
not
sure
what
to
do
about
it
guys
it
me
marcus
stay
free
behind
one
of
the
doors
someone
sobbed
someone
else
cried
out
in
what
sounded
like
arabic
then
it
was
cacophony
a
thousand
different
shouting
voices
they
brought
me
to
a
new
room
it
was
an
old
with
the
still
present
in
the
mould
tiles
hello
severe
haircut
said
you
seem
to
have
had
an
eventful
morning
she
wrinkled
her
nose
pointedly
i
pissed
myself
i
said
cheerfully
you
should
try
it
maybe
we
should
give
you
a
bath
then
she
said
she
nodded
and
my
guards
carried
me
to
another
stretcher
this
one
had
restraining
straps
running
its
length
they
dropped
me
onto
it
and
it
was
and
soaked
through
before
i
knew
it
they
had
the
straps
across
my
shoulders
hips
and
ankles
a
minute
later
three
more
straps
were
tied
down
a
man
hands
grabbed
the
railings
by
my
head
and
released
some
catches
and
a
moment
later
i
was
tilted
down
my
head
below
my
feet
let
start
with
something
simple
she
said
i
craned
my
head
to
see
her
she
had
turned
to
a
desk
with
an
xbox
on
it
connected
to
an
tv
i
like
you
to
tell
me
your
login
and
password
for
your
pirate
party
email
please
i
closed
my
eyes
and
let
the
ocean
carry
me
off
the
beach
do
you
know
what
waterboarding
is
her
voice
reeled
me
in
you
get
strapped
down
like
this
and
we
pour
water
over
your
head
up
your
nose
and
down
your
mouth
you
ca
suppress
the
gag
reflex
they
call
it
a
simulated
execution
and
from
what
i
can
tell
from
this
side
of
the
room
that
a
fair
assessment
you
wo
be
able
to
fight
the
feeling
that
you
dying
i
tried
to
go
away
i
heard
of
waterboarding
this
was
it
real
torture
and
this
was
just
the
beginning
i
could
go
away
the
ocean
did
sweep
in
and
lift
me
there
was
a
tightness
in
my
chest
my
eyelids
fluttered
i
could
feel
clammy
piss
on
my
legs
and
clammy
sweat
in
my
hair
my
skin
itched
from
the
dried
puke
she
swam
into
view
above
me
let
start
with
the
login
she
said
i
closed
my
eyes
squeezed
them
shut
give
him
a
drink
she
said
i
heard
people
moving
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
held
it
the
water
started
as
a
trickle
a
ladleful
of
water
gently
poured
over
my
chin
my
lips
up
my
upturned
nostrils
it
went
back
into
my
throat
starting
to
choke
me
but
i
would
cough
would
gasp
and
suck
it
into
my
lungs
i
held
onto
my
breath
and
squeezed
my
eyes
harder
there
was
a
commotion
from
outside
the
room
a
sound
of
chaotic
boots
stamping
angry
outraged
shouts
the
dipper
was
emptied
into
my
face
i
heard
her
mutter
something
to
someone
in
the
room
then
to
me
she
said
just
the
login
marcus
it
a
simple
request
what
could
i
do
with
your
login
anyway
this
time
it
was
a
bucket
of
water
all
at
once
a
flood
that
did
stop
it
must
have
been
gigantic
i
could
help
it
i
gasped
and
aspirated
the
water
into
my
lungs
coughed
and
took
more
water
in
i
knew
they
would
kill
me
but
i
could
convince
my
body
of
that
in
every
fiber
of
my
being
i
knew
i
was
going
to
die
i
could
even
cry
the
water
was
still
pouring
over
me
then
it
stopped
i
coughed
and
coughed
and
coughed
but
at
the
angle
i
was
at
the
water
i
coughed
up
dribbled
back
into
my
nose
and
burned
down
my
sinuses
the
coughs
were
so
deep
they
hurt
hurt
my
ribs
and
my
hips
as
i
twisted
against
them
i
hated
how
my
body
was
betraying
me
how
my
mind
could
control
my
body
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
finally
the
coughing
subsided
enough
for
me
to
take
in
what
was
going
on
around
me
people
were
shouting
and
it
sounded
like
someone
was
scuffling
wrestling
i
opened
my
eyes
and
blinked
into
the
bright
light
then
craned
my
neck
still
coughing
a
little
the
room
had
a
lot
more
people
in
it
than
it
had
had
when
we
started
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
wearing
body
armor
helmets
and
visors
they
were
shouting
at
the
treasure
island
guards
who
were
shouting
back
necks
corded
with
veins
stand
down
one
of
the
said
stand
down
and
put
your
hands
in
the
air
you
are
under
arrest
severe
haircut
woman
was
talking
on
her
phone
one
of
the
body
armors
noticed
her
and
he
moved
swiftly
to
her
and
batted
her
phone
away
with
a
gloved
hand
everyone
fell
silent
as
it
sailed
through
the
air
in
an
arc
that
spanned
the
small
room
clattering
to
the
ground
in
a
shower
of
parts
the
silence
broke
and
the
moved
into
the
room
two
grabbed
each
of
my
torturers
i
almost
managed
a
smile
at
the
look
on
severe
haircut
face
when
two
men
grabbed
her
by
the
shoulders
turned
her
around
and
yanked
a
set
of
plastic
handcuffs
around
her
wrists
one
of
the
moved
forward
from
the
doorway
he
had
a
video
camera
on
his
shoulder
a
serious
rig
with
blinding
white
light
he
got
the
whole
room
circling
me
twice
while
he
got
me
i
found
myself
staying
perfectly
still
as
though
i
was
sitting
for
a
portrait
it
was
ridiculous
do
you
think
you
could
get
me
off
of
this
thing
i
managed
to
get
it
all
out
with
only
a
little
choking
two
more
body
armors
moved
up
to
me
one
a
woman
and
began
to
unstrap
me
they
flipped
their
visors
up
and
smiled
at
me
they
had
red
crosses
on
their
shoulders
and
helmets
beneath
the
red
crosses
was
another
insignia
chp
california
highway
patrol
they
were
state
troopers
i
started
to
ask
what
they
were
doing
there
and
that
when
i
saw
barbara
stratford
she
evidently
been
held
back
in
the
corridor
but
now
she
came
in
pushing
and
shoving
there

are
she
said
kneeling
beside
me
and
grabbing
me
in
the
longest
hardest
hug
of
my
life
that
when
i
knew
it
guantanamo
by
the
bay
was
in
the
hands
of
its
enemies

was
saved

and
barf
when
i
finished
barbara
was
in
tears
your
parents
she
began
i
felt
like
i
might
throw
up
again
god
my
poor
folks
what
they
must
have
gone
through
are
they
here
no
she
said
it
complicated
she
said
what
you
still
under
arrest
marcus
everyone
here
is
they
ca
just
sweep
in
and
throw
open
the
doors
everyone
here
is
going
to
have
to
be
processed
through
the
criminal
justice
system
it
could
take
well
it
could
take
months
i
going
to
have
to
stay
here
for
she
grabbed
my
hands
no
i
think
we
going
to
be
able
to
get
you
arraigned
and
released
on
bail
pretty
fast
but
pretty
fast
is
a
relative
term
i
would
expect
anything
to
happen
today
and
it
not
going
to
be
like
those
people
had
it
it
will
be
humane
there
will
be
real
food
no
interrogations
visits
from
your
family
just
because
the
dhs
is
out
it
does
mean
that
you
get
to
just
walk
out
of
here
what
happened
here
is
that
we
getting
rid
of
the
version
of
the
justice
system
they
instituted
and
replacing
it
with
the
old
system
the
system
with
judges
open
trials
and
lawyers
so
we
can
try
to
get
you
transferred
to
a
juvie
facility
on
the
mainland
but
marcus
those
places
can
be
really
rough
really
really
rough
this
might
be
the
best
place
for
you
until
we
get
you
bailed
out
bailed
out
of
course
i
was
a
criminal
i
had
been
charged
yet
but
there
were
bound
to
be
plenty
of
charges
they
could
think
of
it
was
practically
illegal
just
to
think
impure
thoughts
about
the
government
she
gave
my
hands
another
squeeze
it
sucks
but
this
is
how
it
has
to
be
the
point
is
it
the
governor
has
thrown
the
dhs
out
of
the
state
dismantled
every
checkpoint
the
attorney
general
has
issued
warrants
for
any
officers
involved
in
interrogations
and
secret
imprisonments
they
go
to
jail
marcus
and
it
because
of
what
you
did
i
was
numb
i
heard
the
words
but
they
hardly
made
sense
somehow
it
was
over
but
it
was
over
look
she
said
we
probably
have
an
hour
or
two
before
this
all
settles
down
before
they
come
back
and
put
you
away
again
what
do
you
want
to
do
walk
on
the
beach
get
a
meal
these
people
had
an
incredible
staff
room
we
raided
it
on
the
way
in
gourmet
all
the
way
at
last
a
question
i
could
answer
i
want
to
find
ange
i
want
to
find
darryl
i
tried
to
use
a
computer
i
found
to
look
up
their
but
it
wanted
a
password
so
we
were
reduced
to
walking
the
corridors
calling
out
their
names
behind
the
prisoners
screamed
back
at
us
or
cried
or
begged
us
to
let
them
go
they
did
understand
what
had
just
happened
could
see
their
former
guards
being
herded
onto
the
docks
in
plastic
handcuffs
taken
away
by
california
state
swat
teams
ange
i
called
over
the
din
ange
carvelli
darryl
glover
it
marcus
we
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
and
they
had
answered
i
felt
like
crying
they
been
shipped
overseas
they
were
in
syria
or
worse
i
never
see
them
again
i
sat
down
and
leaned
against
the
corridor
wall
and
put
my
face
in
my
hands
i
saw
severe
haircut
woman
face
saw
her
smirk
as
she
asked
me
for
my
login
she
had
done
this
she
would
go
to
jail
for
it
but
that
was
enough
i
thought
that
when
i
saw
her
again
i
might
kill
her
she
deserved
it
come
on
barbara
said
come
on
marcus
do
give
up
there
more
around
here
come
on
she
was
right
all
the
doors
we
passed
in
the
cellblock
were
old
rusting
things
that
dated
back
to
when
the
base
was
first
built
but
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
sagging
open
was
a
new
door
as
thick
as
a
dictionary
we
pulled
it
open
and
ventured
into
the
dark
corridor
within
there
were
four
more
here
doors
without
bar
codes
each
had
a
small
electronic
keypad
mounted
on
it
darryl
i
said
ange
marcus
it
was
ange
calling
out
from
behind
the
furthest
door
ange
my
ange
my
angel
ange
i
cried
it
me
it
me
oh
god
marcus
she
choked
out
and
then
it
was
all
sobs
i
pounded
on
the
other
doors
darryl
darryl
are
you
here
i
here
the
voice
was
very
small
and
very
hoarse
i
here
i
very
very
sorry
please
i
very
sorry
he
sounded
broken
shattered
it
me
d
i
said
leaning
on
his
door
it
marcus
it
over
they
arrested
the
guards
they
kicked
the
department
of
homeland
security
out
we
getting
trials
open
trials
and
we
get
to
testify
against
i
sorry
he
said
please
i
so
sorry
the
california
patrolmen
came
to
the
door
then
they
still
had
their
camera
rolling
ms
stratford
one
said
he
had
his
faceplate
up
and
he
looked
like
any
other
cop
not
like
my
savior
like
someone
come
to
lock
me
up
captain
sanchez
she
said
we
located
two
of
the
prisoners
of
interest
here
i
like
to
see
them
released
and
inspect
them
for
myself
we
do
have
access
codes
for
those
doors
yet
he
said
she
held
up
her
hand
that
was
the
arrangement
i
was
to
have
complete
access
to
this
facility
that
came
direct
from
the
governor
sir
we
are
budging
until
you
open
these
cells
her
face
was
perfectly
smooth
without
a
single
hint
of
give
or
flex
she
meant
it
the
captain
looked
like
he
needed
sleep
he
grimaced
i
see
what
i
can
do
he
said
they
did
manage
to
open
the
cells
finally
about
half
an
hour
later
it
took
three
tries
but
they
eventually
got
the
right
codes
entered
matching
them
to
the
arphids
on
the
id
badges
they
taken
off
the
guards
they
arrested
they
got
into
ange
cell
first
she
was
dressed
in
a
hospital
gown
open
at
the
back
and
her
cell
was
even
more
bare
than
mine
had
been
just
padding
all
over
no
sink
or
bed
no
light
she
emerged
blinking
into
the
corridor
and
the
police
camera
was
on
her
its
bright
lights
in
her
face
barbara
stepped
protectively
between
us
and
it
ange
stepped
tentatively
out
of
her
cell
shuffling
a
little
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
eyes
with
her
face
she
was
crying
but
that
was
it
they
drugged
me
she
said
when
i
would
stop
screaming
for
a
lawyer
that
when
i
hugged
her
she
sagged
against
me
but
she
squeezed
back
too
she
smelled
stale
and
sweaty
and
i
smelled
no
better
i
never
wanted
to
let
go
that
when
they
opened
darryl
cell
he
had
shredded
his
paper
hospital
gown
he
was
curled
up
naked
in
the
back
of
the
cell
shielding
himself
from
the
camera
and
our
stares
i
ran
to
him
d
i
whispered
in
his
ear
d
it
me
it
marcus
it
over
the
guards
have
been
arrested
we
going
to
get
bail
we
going
home
he
trembled
and
squeezed
his
eyes
shut
i
sorry
he
whispered
and
turned
his
face
away
they
took
me
away
then
a
cop
in
and
barbara
took
me
back
to
my
cell
and
locked
the
door
and
that
where
i
spent
the
night
i
do
remember
much
about
the
trip
to
the
courthouse
they
had
me
chained
to
five
other
prisoners
all
of
whom
had
been
in
for
a
lot
longer
than
me
one
only
spoke
arabic
he
was
an
old
man
and
he
trembled
the
others
were
all
young
i
was
the
only
white
one
once
we
had
been
gathered
on
the
deck
of
the
ferry
i
saw
that
nearly
everyone
on
treasure
island
had
been
one
shade
of
brown
or
another
i
had
only
been
inside
for
one
night
but
it
was
too
long
there
was
a
light
drizzle
coming
down
normally
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
make
me
hunch
my
shoulders
and
look
down
but
today
i
joined
everyone
else
in
craning
my
head
back
at
the
infinite
gray
sky
reveling
in
the
stinging
wet
as
we
raced
across
the
bay
to
the
they
took
us
away
in
buses
the
shackles
made
climbing
into
the
buses
awkward
and
it
took
a
long
time
for
everyone
to
load
no
one
cared
when
we
were
struggling
to
solve
the
geometry
problem
of
six
people
one
chain
narrow
we
were
just
looking
around
at
the
city
around
us
up
the
hill
at
the
buildings
all
i
could
think
of
was
finding
darryl
and
ange
but
neither
were
in
evidence
it
was
a
big
crowd
and
we
were
allowed
to
move
freely
through
it
the
state
troopers
who
handled
us
were
gentle
enough
but
they
were
still
big
armored
and
armed
i
kept
thinking
i
saw
darryl
in
the
crowd
but
it
was
always
someone
else
with
that
same
beaten
hunched
look
that
he
had
in
his
cell
he
was
the
only
broken
one
at
the
courthouse
they
marched
us
into
interview
rooms
in
our
shackle
group
an
aclu
lawyer
took
our
information
and
asked
us
a
few
questions
when
she
got
to
me
she
smiled
and
greeted
me
by
name
and
then
led
us
into
the
courtroom
before
the
judge
he
wore
an
actual
robe
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
good
mood
the
deal
seemed
to
be
that
anyone
who
had
a
family
member
to
post
bail
could
go
free
and
everyone
else
got
sent
to
prison
the
aclu
lawyer
did
a
lot
of
talking
to
the
judge
asking
for
a
few
more
hours
while
the
prisoners
families
were
rounded
up
and
brought
to
the
the
judge
was
pretty
good
about
it
but
when
i
realized
that
some
of
these
people
had
been
locked
up
since
the
bridge
blew
taken
for
dead
by
their
families
without
trial
subjected
to
interrogation
isolation
torture
i
wanted
to
just
break
the
chains
myself
and
set
everyone
free
when
i
was
brought
before
the
judge
he
looked
down
at
me
and
took
off
his
glasses
he
looked
tired
the
aclu
lawyer
looked
tired
the
bailiffs
looked
tired
behind
me
i
could
hear
a
sudden
buzz
of
conversation
as
my
name
was
called
by
the
bailiff
the
judge
rapped
his
gavel
once
without
looking
away
from
me
he
scrubbed
at
his
eyes
mr
yallow
he
said
the
prosecution
has
identified
you
as
a
flight
risk
i
think
they
have
a
point
you
certainly
have
more
shall
we
say
than
the
other
people
here
i
am
tempted
to
hold
you
over
for
trial
no
matter
how
much
bail
your
parents
are
prepared
to
post
my
lawyer
started
to
say
something
but
the
judge
silenced
her
with
a
look
he
scrubbed
at
his
eyes
do
you
have
anything
to
say
i
had
the
chance
to
run
i
said
last
week
someone
offered
to
take
me
away
get
me
out
of
town
help
me
build
a
new
identity
instead
i
stole
her
phone
escaped
from
our
truck
and
ran
away
i
turned
over
her
phone
which
had
evidence
about
my
friend
darryl
glover
on
it
to
a
journalist
and
hid
out
here
in
town
you
stole
a
phone
i
decided
that
i
could
run
that
i
had
to
face
justice
that
my
freedom
was
worth
anything
if
i
was
a
wanted
man
or
if
the
city
was
still
under
the
dhs
if
my
friends
were
still
locked
up
that
freedom
for
me
was
as
important
as
a
free
country
but
you
did
steal
a
phone
i
nodded
i
did
i
plan
on
giving
it
back
if
i
ever
find
the
young
woman
in
question
well
thank
you
for
that
speech
mr
yallow
you
are
a
very
well
spoken
young
man
he
glared
at
the
prosecutor
some
would
say
a
very
brave
man
too
there
was
a
certain
video
on
the
news
this
morning
it
suggested
that
you
had
some
legitimate
reason
to
evade
the
authorities
in
light
of
that
and
of
your
little
speech
here
i
will
grant
bail
but
i
will
also
ask
the
prosecutor
to
add
a
charge
of
misdemeanor
petty
theft
to
the
count
as
regards
the
matter
of
the
phone
for
this
i
expect
another
in
bail
he
banged
his
gavel
again
and
my
lawyer
gave
my
hand
a
squeeze
he
looked
down
at
me
again
and
his
glasses
he
had
dandruff
there
on
the
shoulders
of
his
robe
a
little
more
rained
down
as
his
glasses
touched
his
wiry
curly
hair
you
can
go
now
young
man
stay
out
of
trouble
i
turned
to
go
and
someone
tackled
me
it
was
dad
he
literally
lifted
me
off
my
feet
hugging
me
so
hard
my
ribs
creaked
he
hugged
me
the
way
i
remembered
him
hugging
me
when
i
was
a
little
boy
when
he
spin
me
around
and
around
in
hilarious
vomitous
games
of
airplane
that
ended
with
him
tossing
me
in
the
air
and
catching
me
and
squeezing
me
like
that
so
hard
it
almost
hurt
a
set
of
softer
hands
pried
me
gently
out
of
his
arms
mom
she
held
me
at
arm
length
for
a
moment
searching
my
face
for
something
not
saying
anything
tears
streaming
down
her
face
she
smiled
and
it
turned
into
a
sob
and
then
she
was
holding
me
too
and
dad
arm
encircled
us
both
when
they
let
go
i
managed
to
finally
say
something
darryl
his
father
met
me
somewhere
else
he
in
the
hospital
when
can
i
see
him
it
our
next
stop
dad
said
he
was
grim
he
does
he
stopped
they
say
he
be
ok
he
said
his
voice
was
choked
how
about
ange
her
mother
took
her
home
she
wanted
to
wait
here
for
you
but
i
understood
i
felt
full
of
understanding
now
for
how
all
the
families
of
all
the
people
who
been
locked
away
must
feel
the
courtroom
was
full
of
tears
and
hugs
and
even
the
bailiffs
could
stop
it
let
go
see
darryl
i
said
and
let
me
borrow
your
phone
i
called
ange
on
the
way
to
the
hospital
where
they
were
keeping
darryl
san
francisco
general
just
down
the
street
from
us
and
arranged
to
see
her
after
dinner
she
talked
in
a
hurried
whisper
her
mom
was
sure
whether
to
punish
her
or
not
but
ange
did
want
to
tempt
fate
there
were
two
state
troopers
in
the
corridor
where
darryl
was
being
held
they
were
holding
off
a
legion
of
reporters
who
stood
on
tiptoe
to
see
around
them
and
get
pictures
the
flashes
popped
in
our
eyes
like
strobes
and
i
shook
my
head
to
clear
it
my
parents
had
brought
me
clean
clothes
and
i
changed
in
the
back
seat
but
i
still
felt
gross
even
after
scrubbing
myself
in
the
bathrooms
some
of
the
reporters
called
my
name
oh
yeah
that
right
i
was
famous
now
the
state
troopers
gave
me
a
look
too
either
they
recognized
my
face
or
my
name
when
the
reporters
called
it
out
darryl
father
met
us
at
the
door
of
his
hospital
room
speaking
in
a
whisper
too
low
for
the
reporters
to
hear
he
was
in
civvies
the
jeans
and
sweater
i
normally
thought
of
him
wearing
but
he
had
his
service
ribbons
pinned
to
his
breast
he
sleeping
he
said
he
woke
up
a
little
while
ago
and
he
started
crying
he
could
stop
they
gave
him
something
to
help
him
sleep
he
led
us
in
and
there
was
darryl
his
hair
clean
and
combed
sleeping
with
his
mouth
open
there
was
white
stuff
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
had
a
room
and
in
the
other
bed
there
was
an
older
guy
in
his
i
realized
it
was
the
guy
i
been
chained
to
on
the
way
off
of
treasure
island
we
exchanged
embarrassed
waves
then
i
turned
back
to
darryl
i
took
his
hand
his
nails
had
been
chewed
to
the
quick
he
been
a
when
he
was
a
kid
but
he
kicked
the
habit
when
we
got
to
high
school
i
think
van
talked
him
out
of
it
telling
him
how
gross
it
was
for
him
to
have
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
all
the
time
i
heard
my
parents
and
darryl
dad
take
a
step
away
drawing
the
curtains
around
us
i
put
my
face
down
next
to

had
a
straggly
patchy
beard
that
reminded
me
of

going
to
be

snored
a
little
i
almost
said
i
love
you
a
phrase
i
only
said
to
one
ever
a
phrase
that
was
weird
to
say
to
another

in
the

just
gave

epilogue
this
chapter
is
dedicated
to
hudson
booksellers
the
booksellers
that
are
in
practically
every
airport
in
the
usa
most
of
the
hudson
stands
have
just
a
few
titles
though
those
are
often
surprisingly
diverse
but
the
big
ones
like
the
one
in
the
aa
terminal
at
chicago
are
as
good
as
any
neighborhood
store
it
takes
something
special
to
bring
a
personal
touch
to
an
airport
and
hudson
has
saved
my
mind
on
more
than
one
long
chicago
layover
hudson

http
barbara
called
me
at
the
office
on
july
weekend
i
was
the
only
one
who
come
into
work
on
the
holiday
weekend
but
i
was
the
only
one
whose
excuse
was
that
my
program
would
let
me
leave
town
in
the
end
they
convicted
me
of
stealing
masha
phone
can
you
believe
that
the
prosecution
had
done
a
deal
with
my
lawyer
to
drop
all
charges
related
to
electronic
terrorism
and
inciting
riots
in
exchange
for
my
pleading
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor
petty
theft
charge
i
got
three
months
in
a
program
with
a
house
for
juvenile
offenders
in
the
mission
i
slept
at
the
halfway
house
sharing
a
dorm
with
a
bunch
of
actual
criminals
gang
kids
and
druggie
kids
a
couple
of
real
nuts
during
the
day
i
was
free
to
go
out
and
work
at
my
job
marcus
they
letting
her
go
she
said
who
johnstone
carrie
johnstone
she
said
the
closed
military
tribunal
cleared
her
of
any
wrongdoing
the
file
is
sealed
she
being
returned
to
active
duty
they
sending
her
to
iraq
carrie
johnstone
was
severe
haircut
woman
name
it
came
out
in
the
preliminary
hearings
at
the
california
superior
court
but
that
was
just
about
all
that
came
out
she
would
say
a
word
about
who
she
took
orders
from
what
she
done
who
had
been
imprisoned
and
why
she
just
sat
perfectly
silent
day
after
day
in
the
courthouse
the
feds
meanwhile
had
blustered
and
shouted
about
the
governor
unilateral
illegal
of
the
treasure
island
facility
and
the
mayor
eviction
of
fed
cops
from
san
francisco
a
lot
of
those
cops
had
ended
up
in
state
prisons
along
with
the
guards
from
then
one
day
there
was
no
statement
from
the
white
house
nothing
from
the
state
capitol
and
the
next
day
there
was
a
dry
tense
held
jointly
on
the
steps
of
the
governor
mansion
where
the
head
of
the
dhs
and
the
governor
announced
their
understanding
the
dhs
would
hold
a
closed
military
tribunal
to
investigate
possible
errors
in
judgment
committed
after
the
attack
on
the
bay
bridge
the
tribunal
would
use
every
tool
at
its
disposal
to
ensure
that
criminal
acts
were
properly
punished
in
return
control
over
dhs
operations
in
california
would
go
through
the
state
senate
which
would
have
the
power
to
shut
down
inspect
or
all
homeland
security
in
the
state
the
roar
of
the
reporters
had
been
deafening
and
barbara
had
gotten
the
first
question
in
mr
governor
with
all
due
respect
we
have
incontrovertible
video
evidence
that
marcus
yallow
a
citizen
of
this
state
native
born
was
subjected
to
a
simulated
execution
by
dhs
officers
apparently
acting
on
orders
from
the
white
house
is
the
state
really
willing
to
abandon
any
pretense
of
justice
for
its
citizens
in
the
face
of
illegal
barbaric
her
voice
trembled
but
did
crack
the
governor
spread
his
hands
the
military
tribunals
will
accomplish
justice
if
mr
yallow
or
any
other
person
who
has
cause
to
fault
the
department
of
homeland
security
wants
further
justice
he
is
of
course
entitled
to
sue
for
such
damages
as
may
be
owing
to
him
from
the
federal
government
that
what
i
was
doing
over
twenty
thousand
civil
lawsuits
were
filed
against
the
dhs
in
the
week
after
the
governor
announcement
mine
was
being
handled
by
the
aclu
and
they
filed
motions
to
get
at
the
results
of
the
closed
military
tribunals
so
far
the
courts
were
pretty
sympathetic
to
this
but
i
had
expected
this
she
got
off
totally
the
press
release
does
say
much
a
thorough
examination
of
the
events
in
san
francisco
and
in
the
special
detention
center
on
treasure
island
it
is
the
finding
of
this
tribunal
that
ms
johnstone
actions
do
not
warrant
further
discipline
there
that
word
like
they
already
punished
her
i
snorted
i
dreamed
of
carrie
johnstone
nearly
every
night
since
i
was
released
from
i
seen
her
face
looming
over
mine
that
little
snarly
smile
as
she
told
the
man
to
give
me
a
drink
marcus
barbara
said
but
i
cut
her
off
it
fine
it
fine
i
going
to
do
a
video
about
this
get
it
out
over
the
weekend
mondays
are
big
days
for
viral
video
everyone
be
coming
back
from
the
holiday
weekend
looking
for
something
funny
to
forward
around
school
or
the
office
i
saw
a
shrink
twice
a
week
as
part
of
my
deal
at
the
halfway
house
once
i
gotten
over
seeing
that
as
some
kind
of
punishment
it
had
been
good
he
helped
me
focus
on
doing
constructive
things
when
i
was
upset
instead
of
letting
it
eat
me
up
the
videos
helped
i
have
to
go
i
said
swallowing
hard
to
keep
the
emotion
out
of
my
voice
take
care
of
yourself
marcus
barbara
said
ange
hugged
me
from
behind
as
i
hung
up
the
phone
i
just
read
about
it
online
she
said
she
read
a
million
newsfeeds
pulling
them
with
a
headline
reader
that
sucked
up
stories
as
fast
as
they
ended
up
on
the
wire
she
was
our
official
blogger
and
she
was
good
at
it
snipping
out
the
interesting
stories
and
throwing
them
online
like
a
short
order
cook
turning
around
breakfast
orders
i
turned
around
in
her
arms
so
that
i
was
hugging
her
from
in
front
truth
be
told
we
had
gotten
a
lot
of
work
done
that
day
i
was
allowed
to
be
out
of
the
halfway
house
after
dinner
time
and
she
could
visit
me
there
we
saw
each
other
around
the
office
but
there
were
usually
a
lot
of
other
people
around
which
kind
of
put
a
crimp
in
our
cuddling
being
alone
in
the
office
for
a
day
was
too
much
temptation
it
was
hot
and
sultry
too
which
meant
we
were
both
in
and
shorts
a
lot
of
contact
as
we
worked
next
to
each
other
i
going
to
make
a
video
i
said
i
want
to
release
it
today
good
she
said
let
do
it
ange
read
the
i
did
a
little
monologue
synched
over
that
famous
footage
of
me
on
the
eyes
wild
in
the
harsh
light
of
the
camera
tears
streaming
down
my
face
hair
matted
and
flecked
with
barf
this
is
me
i
am
on
a
waterboard
i
am
being
tortured
in
a
simulated
execution
the
torture
is
supervised
by
a
woman
called
carrie
johnstone
she
works
for
the
government
you
might
remember
her
from
this
video
i
cut
in
the
video
of
johnstone
and
kurt
rooney
that
johnstone
and
secretary
of
state
kurt
rooney
the
president
chief
strategist
the
nation
does
not
love
that
city
as
far
as
they
concerned
it
is
a
sodom
and
gomorrah
of
fags
and
atheists
who
deserve
to
rot
in
hell
the
only
reason
the
country
cares
what
they
think
in
san
francisco
is
that
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
been
blown
to
hell
by
some
islamic
terrorists
he
talking
about
the
city
where
i
live
at
last
count
of
my
neighbors
were
killed
on
the
day
he
talking
about
but
some
of
them
may
not
have
been
killed
some
of
them
disappeared
into
the
same
prison
where
i
was
tortured
some
mothers
and
fathers
children
and
lovers
brothers
and
sisters
will
never
see
their
loved
ones
again
because
they
were
secretly
imprisoned
in
an
illegal
jail
right
here
in
the
san
francisco
bay
they
were
shipped
overseas
the
records
were
meticulous
but
carrie
johnstone
has
the
encryption
keys
i
cut
back
to
carrie
johnstone
the
footage
of
her
sitting
at
the
board
table
with
rooney
laughing
i
cut
in
the
footage
of
johnstone
being
arrested
when
they
arrested
her
i
thought
we
get
justice
all
the
people
she
broke
and
disappeared
but
the
president
i
cut
to
a
still
of
him
laughing
and
playing
golf
on
one
of
his
many
holidays
and
his
chief
strategist
now
a
still
of
rooney
shaking
hands
with
an
infamous
terrorist
leader
who
used
to
be
on
our
side
intervened
they
sent
her
to
a
secret
military
tribunal
and
now
that
tribunal
has
cleared
her
somehow
they
saw
nothing
wrong
with
all
of
this
i
cut
in
a
photomontage
of
the
hundreds
of
shots
of
prisoners
in
their
cells
that
barbara
had
published
on
the
bay
guardian
site
the
day
we
were
released
we
elected
these
people
we
pay
their
salaries
they
supposed
to
be
on
our
side
they
supposed
to
defend
our
freedoms
but
these
people
a
series
of
shots
of
johnstone
and
the
others
who
been
sent
to
the
tribunal
betrayed
our
trust
the
election
is
four
months
away
that
a
lot
of
time
enough
for
you
to
go
out
and
find
five
of
your
neighbors
five
people
who
given
up
on
voting
because
their
choice
is
of
the
above
talk
to
your
neighbors
make
them
promise
to
vote
make
them
promise
to
take
the
country
back
from
the
torturers
and
thugs
the
people
who
laughed
at
my
friends
as
they
lay
fresh
in
their
graves
at
the
bottom
of
the
harbor
make
them
promise
to
talk
to
their
neighbors
most
of
us
choose
none
of
the
above
it
not
working
you
have
to
choose
choose
freedom
my
name
is
marcus
yallow
i
was
tortured
by
my
country
but
i
still
love
it
here
i
seventeen
years
old
i
want
to
grow
up
in
a
free
country
i
want
to
live
in
a
free
country
i
faded
out
to
the
logo
of
the
website
ange
had
built
it
with
help
from
jolu
who
got
us
all
the
free
hosting
we
could
ever
need
on
pigspleen
the
office
was
an
interesting
place
technically
we
were
called
coalition
of
voters
for
a
free
america
but
everyone
called
us
the
xnetters
the
organization
a
charitable
nonprofit
had
been
by
barbara
and
some
of
her
lawyer
friends
right
after
the
liberation
of
treasure
island
the
funding
was
kicked
off
by
some
tech
millionaires
who
could
believe
that
a
bunch
of
hacker
kids
had
kicked
the
dhs
ass
sometimes
they
ask
us
to
go
down
the
peninsula
to
sand
hill
road
where
all
the
venture
capitalists
were
and
give
a
little
presentation
on
xnet
technology
there
were
about
a
zillion
startups
who
were
trying
to
make
a
buck
on
the
xnet
whatever
i
did
have
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
and
i
got
a
desk
and
an
office
with
a
storefront
right
there
on
valencia
street
where
we
gave
away
paranoidxbox
cds
and
held
workshops
on
building
better
wifi
antennas
a
surprising
number
of
average
people
dropped
in
to
make
personal
donations
both
of
hardware
you
can
run
paranoidlinux
on
just
about
anything
not
just
xbox
universals
and
cash
money
they
loved
us
the
big
plan
was
to
launch
our
own
arg
in
september
just
in
time
for
the
election
and
to
really
tie
it
in
with
signing
up
voters
and
getting
them
to
the
polls
only
percent
of
americans
showed
up
at
the
polls
for
the
last
election
nonvoters
had
a
huge
majority
i
kept
trying
to
get
darryl
and
van
to
one
of
our
planning
sessions
but
they
kept
on
declining
they
were
spending
a
lot
of
time
together
and
van
insisted
that
it
was
totally
nonromantic
darryl
would
talk
to
me
much
at
all
though
he
sent
me
long
emails
about
just
about
everything
that
was
about
van
or
terrorism
or
prison
ange
squeezed
my
hand
god
i
hate
that
woman
she
said
i
nodded
just
one
more
rotten
thing
this
country
done
to
iraq
i
said
if
they
sent
her
to
my
town
i
probably
become
a
terrorist
you
did
become
a
terrorist
when
they
sent
her
to
your
town
so
i
did
i
said
are
you
going
to
ms
galvez
hearing
on
monday
totally
i
introduced
ange
to
ms
galvez
a
couple
weeks
before
when
my
old
teacher
invited
me
over
for
dinner
the
teacher
union
had
gotten
a
hearing
for
her
before
the
board
of
the
unified
school
district
to
argue
for
getting
her
old
job
back
they
said
that
fred
benson
was
coming
out
of
early
retirement
to
testify
against
her
i
was
looking
forward
to
seeing
her
again
do
you
want
to
go
get
a
burrito
totally
let
me
get
my
she
said
i
checked
my
email
one
more
time
my
pirateparty
email
which
still
got
a
dribble
of
messages
from
old
xnetters
who
had
found
my
coalition
of
voters
address
yet
the
latest
message
was
from
a
throwaway
email
address
from
one
of
the
new
brazilian
anonymizers
found
her
thanks
you
did
tell
me
she
was
so
who
from
i
laughed
zeb
i
said
remember
zeb
i
gave
him
masha
email
address
i
figured
if
they
both
underground
might
as
well
introduce
them
to
one
another
he
thinks
masha
is
give
the
guy
a
break
he
clearly
had
his
mind
warped
by
circumstances
and
you
me
yeah
was
your
mind
warped
by
circumstances
i
held
ange
out
at
arm
length
and
looked
her
up
and
down
and
up
and
down
i
held
her
cheeks
and
stared
through
her
glasses
into
her
big
mischievous
tilted
eyes
i
ran
my
fingers
through
her
hair
ange
i
never
thought
more
clearly
in
my
whole
life
she
kissed
me
then
and
i
kissed
her
back
and
it
was
some
time
before
we
went
out
for
that
burrito
afterword
by
bruce
schneier
i
a
security
technologist
my
job
is
making
people
secure
i
think
about
security
systems
and
how
to
break
them
then
how
to
make
them
more
secure
computer
security
systems
surveillance
systems
airplane
security
systems
and
voting
machines
and
rfid
chips
and
everything
else
cory
invited
me
into
the
last
few
pages
of
his
book
because
he
wanted
me
to
tell
you
that
security
is
fun
it
incredibly
fun
it
cat
and
mouse
who
can
outsmart
whom
hunter
versus
hunted
fun
i
think
it
the
most
fun
job
you
can
possibly
have
if
you
thought
it
was
fun
to
read
about
marcus
outsmarting
the
cameras
with
rocks
in
his
shoes
think
of
how
much
more
fun
it
would
be
if
you
were
the
first
person
in
the
world
to
think
of
that
working
in
security
means
knowing
a
lot
about
technology
it
might
mean
knowing
about
computers
and
networks
or
cameras
and
how
they
work
or
the
chemistry
of
bomb
detection
but
really
security
is
a
mindset
it
a
way
of
thinking
marcus
is
a
great
example
of
that
way
of
thinking
he
always
looking
for
ways
a
security
system
fails
i
bet
he
could
walk
into
a
store
without
figuring
out
a
way
to
shoplift
not
that
he
do
it
there
a
difference
between
knowing
how
to
defeat
a
security
system
and
actually
defeating
it
but
he
know
he
could
it
how
security
people
think
we
constantly
looking
at
security
systems
and
how
to
get
around
them
we
ca
help
it
this
kind
of
thinking
is
important
no
matter
what
side
of
security
you
on
if
you
been
hired
to
build
a
store
you
better
know
how
to
shoplift
if
you
designing
a
camera
system
that
detects
individual
gaits
you
better
plan
for
people
putting
rocks
in
their
shoes
because
if
you
do
you
not
going
to
design
anything
good
so
when
you
wandering
through
your
day
take
a
moment
to
look
at
the
security
systems
around
you
look
at
the
cameras
in
the
stores
you
shop
at
do
they
prevent
crime
or
just
move
it
next
door
see
how
a
restaurant
operates
if
you
pay
after
you
eat
why
do
more
people
just
leave
without
paying
pay
attention
at
airport
security
how
could
you
get
a
weapon
onto
an
airplane
watch
what
the
teller
does
at
a
bank
bank
security
is
designed
to
prevent
tellers
from
stealing
just
as
much
as
it
is
to
prevent
you
from
stealing
stare
at
an
anthill
insects
are
all
about
security
read
the
constitution
and
notice
all
the
ways
it
provides
people
with
security
against
government
look
at
traffic
lights
and
door
locks
and
all
the
security
systems
on
television
and
in
the
movies
figure
out
how
they
work
what
threats
they
protect
against
and
what
threats
they
do
how
they
fail
and
how
they
can
be
exploited
spend
enough
time
doing
this
and
you
find
yourself
thinking
differently
about
the
world
you
start
noticing
that
many
of
the
security
systems
out
there
do
actually
do
what
they
claim
to
and
that
much
of
our
national
security
is
a
waste
of
money
you
understand
privacy
as
essential
to
security
not
in
opposition
you
stop
worrying
about
things
other
people
worry
about
and
start
worrying
about
things
other
people
do
even
think
about
sometimes
you
notice
something
about
security
that
no
one
has
ever
thought
about
before
and
maybe
you
figure
out
a
new
way
to
break
a
security
system
it
was
only
a
few
years
ago
that
someone
invented
phishing
i
frequently
amazed
how
easy
it
is
to
break
some
pretty
security
systems
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
for
this
but
the
big
one
is
that
it
impossible
to
prove
that
something
is
secure
all
you
can
do
is
try
to
break
it
if
you
fail
you
know
that
it
secure
enough
to
keep
out
but
what
about
someone
who
smarter
than
you
anyone
can
design
a
security
system
so
strong
he
himself
ca
break
it
think
about
that
for
a
second
because
it
not
obvious
no
one
is
qualified
to
analyze
their
own
security
designs
because
the
designer
and
the
analyzer
will
be
the
same
person
with
the
same
limits
someone
else
has
to
analyze
the
security
because
it
has
to
be
secure
against
things
the
designers
did
think
of
this
means
that
all
of
us
have
to
analyze
the
security
that
other
people
design
and
surprisingly
often
one
of
us
breaks
it
marcus
exploits
are
that
kind
of
thing
happens
all
the
time
go
onto
the
net
and
look
up
bump
key
or
bic
pen
kryptonite
lock
you
find
a
couple
of
really
interesting
stories
about
seemingly
strong
security
defeated
by
pretty
basic
technology
and
when
that
happens
be
sure
to
publish
it
on
the
internet
somewhere
secrecy
and
security
are
the
same
even
though
it
may
seem
that
way
only
bad
security
relies
on
secrecy
good
security
works
even
if
all
the
details
of
it
are
public
and
publishing
vulnerabilities
forces
security
designers
to
design
better
security
and
makes
us
all
better
consumers
of
security
if
you
buy
a
kryptonite
bike
lock
and
it
can
be
defeated
with
a
bic
pen
you
not
getting
very
good
security
for
your
money
and
likewise
if
a
bunch
of
smart
kids
can
defeat
the
dhs
antiterrorist
technologies
then
it
not
going
to
do
a
very
good
job
against
real
terrorists
trading
privacy
for
security
is
stupid
enough
not
getting
any
actual
security
in
the
bargain
is
even
stupider
so
close
the
book
and
go
the
world
is
full
of
security
systems
hack
one
of
them

http
afterword
by
andrew
bunnie
huang
xbox
hacker
â
hackers
are
explorers
digital
pioneers
it
in
a
hacker
nature
to
question
conventions
and
be
tempted
by
intricate
problems
any
complex
system
is
sport
for
a
hacker
a
side
effect
of
this
is
the
hacker
natural
affinity
for
problems
involving
security
society
is
a
large
and
complex
system
and
is
certainly
not
off
limits
to
a
little
hacking
as
a
result
hackers
are
often
stereotyped
as
iconoclasts
and
social
misfits
people
who
defy
social
norms
for
the
sake
of
defiance
when
i
hacked
the
xbox
in
while
at
mit
i
doing
it
to
rebel
or
to
cause
harm
i
was
just
following
a
natural
impulse
the
same
impulse
that
leads
to
fixing
a
broken
ipod
or
exploring
the
roofs
and
tunnels
at
â
unfortunately
the
combination
of
not
complying
with
social
norms
and
knowing
things
like
how
to
read
the
arphid
on
your
credit
card
or
how
to
pick
locks
causes
some
people
to
fear
hackers
however
the
motivations
of
a
hacker
are
typically
as
simple
as
an
engineer
because
i
like
to
design
people
often
ask
me
did
you
hack
the
xbox
security
system
and
my
answer
is
simple
first
i
own
the
things
that
i
buy
if
someone
can
tell
me
what
i
can
and
run
on
my
hardware
then
i
own
it
second
because
there
a
system
of
sufficient
complexity
to
make
good
sport
it
was
a
great
diversion
from
the
late
nights
working
on
my
phd
â
i
was
lucky
the
fact
that
i
was
a
graduate
student
at
mit
when
i
hacked
the
xbox
legitimized
the
activity
in
the
eyes
of
the
right
people
however
the
right
to
hack
only
be
extended
to
academics
i
got
my
start
on
hacking
when
i
was
just
a
boy
in
elementary
school
taking
apart
every
electronic
appliance
i
could
get
my
hands
on
much
to
my
chagrin
my
reading
collection
included
books
on
model
rocketry
artillery
nuclear
weaponry
and
explosives
manufacture
books
that
i
borrowed
from
my
school
library
i
think
the
cold
war
influenced
the
reading
selection
in
public
schools
i
also
played
with
my
fair
share
of
fireworks
and
roamed
the
open
construction
sites
of
houses
being
raised
in
my
midwestern
neighborhood
while
not
the
wisest
of
things
to
do
these
were
important
experiences
in
my
coming
of
age
and
i
grew
up
to
be
a
free
thinker
because
of
the
social
tolerance
and
trust
of
my
community
â
current
events
have
not
been
so
kind
to
aspiring
hackers
little
brother
shows
how
we
can
get
from
where
we
are
today
to
a
world
where
social
tolerance
for
new
and
different
thoughts
dies
altogether
a
recent
event
highlights
exactly
how
close
we
are
to
crossing
the
line
into
the
world
of
little
brother
i
had
the
fortune
of
reading
an
early
draft
of
little
brother
back
in
november
fast
forward
two
months
to
the
end
of
january
when
boston
police
found
suspected
explosive
devices
and
shut
down
the
city
for
a
day
these
devices
turned
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
circuit
boards
with
flashing
leds
promoting
a
show
for
the
cartoon
network
the
artists
who
placed
this
urban
graffiti
were
taken
in
as
suspected
terrorists
and
ultimately
charged
with
felony
the
network
producers
had
to
shell
out
a
million
settlement
and
the
head
of
the
cartoon
network
resigned
over
the
have
the
terrorists
already
won
have
we
given
in
to
fear
such
that
artists
hobbyists
hackers
iconoclasts
or
perhaps
an
unassuming
group
of
kids
playing
harajuku
fun
madness
could
be
so
trivially
implicated
as
terrorists
there
is
a
term
for
this
dysfunction
it
is
called
an
autoimmune
disease
where
an
organism
defense
system
goes
into
overdrive
so
much
that
it
fails
to
recognize
itself
and
attacks
its
own
cells
ultimately
the
organism
right
now
america
is
on
the
verge
of
going
into
anaphylactic
shock
over
its
own
freedoms
and
we
need
to
inoculate
ourselves
against
this
technology
is
no
cure
for
this
paranoia
in
fact
it
may
enhance
the
paranoia
it
turns
us
into
prisoners
of
our
own
device
coercing
millions
of
people
to
strip
off
their
outer
garments
and
walk
barefoot
through
metal
detectors
every
day
is
no
solution
either
it
only
serves
to
remind
the
population
every
day
that
they
have
a
reason
to
be
afraid
while
in
practice
providing
only
a
flimsy
barrier
to
a
determined
adversary
the
truth
is
that
we
ca
count
on
someone
else
to
make
us
feel
free
and
come
and
save
us
the
day
our
freedoms
are
lost
to
paranoia
that
because
is
in
you
and
in
me
little
brother
is
a
reminder
that
no
matter
how
unpredictable
the
future
may
be
we
do
win
freedom
through
security
systems
cryptography
interrogations
and
spot
searches
we
win
freedom
by
having
the
courage
and
the
conviction
to
live
every
day
freely
and
to
act
as
a
free
society
no
matter
how
great
the
threats
are
on
the
horizon
be
like
step
out
the
door
and
dare
to
be
free
bibliography
no
writer
creates
from
scratch
we
all
engage
in
what
isaac
newton
called
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
we
borrow
plunder
and
remix
the
art
and
culture
created
by
those
around
us
and
by
our
literary
forebears
if
you
liked
this
book

there
are
plenty
of
sources
to
turn
to

at
your
local

hacking
is
a
great
subject
all
science
relies
on
telling
other
people
what
you
done
so
that
they
can
verify
it
learn
from
it
and
improve
on
it
and
hacking
is
all
about
that
process
so
there
plenty
published
on
the
subject
start
with
andrew
bunnie
huang

mechanisms
and
opened
the
way
for
all
the
subsequent
cool
hacks
for
the

in
telling
the
story
bunnie
has
also
created
a
kind

every

hammering
away
on

there
are
several
great
magazines
devoted
to
this
subject
but
the
two
best
ones
are

caution
you
