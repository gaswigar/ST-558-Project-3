with
very
profound
respect
this
work
is
dedicated
to
alexander

preface
to
the
few
who
love
me
and
whom
i
those
who
feel
rather
than
to
those
who
the
dreamers
and
those
who
put
faith
in
dreams
as
in
the
only
offer
this
book
of
truths
not
in
its
character
of
but
for
the
beauty
that
abounds
in
its
truth
constituting
it
true
to
these
i
present
the
composition
as
an
alone
us
say
as
a
romance
or
if
i
be
not
urging
too
lofty
a
claim
as
a
poem
i
here
propound
is
it
can
not
die
if
by
any
means
it
be
now
trodden
down
so
that
it
die
it
will
rise
again
to
the
life
nevertheless
it
is
as
a
poem
only
that
i
wish
this
work
to
be
judged
after
i
am
dead
eureka
an
essay
on
the
material
and
spiritual
universe
it
is
with
humility
really
is
with
a
sentiment
even
of
i
pen
the
opening
sentence
of
this
work
for
of
all
conceivable
subjects
i
approach
the
reader
with
the
most
most
most
most
august
what
terms
shall
i
find
sufficiently
simple
in
their
sublime
in
their
the
mere
enunciation
of
my
theme
i
design
to
speak
of
the
metaphysical
and
the
material
and
spiritual
universe
its
essence
its
origin
its
creation
its
present
condition
and
its
i
shall
be
so
rash
moreover
as
to
challenge
the
conclusions
and
thus
in
effect
to
question
the
sagacity
of
many
of
the
greatest
and
most
justly
reverenced
of
men
in
the
beginning
let
me
as
distinctly
as
possible
the
theorem
which
i
hope
to
whatever
the
mathematicians
may
assert
there
is
in
this
world
at
least
such
as
the
ruling
idea
which
throughout
this
volume
i
shall
be
continually
endeavoring
to
suggest
my
general
proposition
then
is
this
the
original
unity
of
the
first
thing
lies
the
secondary
cause
of
all
things
with
the
germ
of
their
inevitable
in
illustration
of
this
idea
i
propose
to
take
such
a
survey
of
the
universe
that
the
mind
may
be
able
really
to
receive
and
to
perceive
an
individual
impression
he
who
from
the
top
of
ætna
casts
his
eyes
leisurely
around
is
affected
chiefly
by
the
and
of
the
scene
only
by
a
rapid
whirling
on
his
heel
could
he
hope
to
comprehend
the
panorama
in
the
sublimity
of
its
but
as
on
the
summit
of
ætna
man
has
thought
of
whirling
on
his
heel
so
no
man
has
ever
taken
into
his
brain
the
full
uniqueness
of
the
prospect
and
so
again
whatever
considerations
lie
involved
in
this
uniqueness
have
as
yet
no
practical
existence
for
mankind
i
do
not
know
a
treatise
in
which
a
survey
of
the
the
word
in
its
most
comprehensive
and
only
legitimate
taken
at
all
it
may
be
as
well
here
to
mention
that
by
the
term
universe
wherever
employed
without
qualification
in
this
essay
i
mean
to
designate
utmost
conceivable
expanse
of
space
with
all
things
spiritual
and
material
that
can
be
imagined
to
exist
within
the
compass
of
that
in
speaking
of
what
is
ordinarily
implied
by
the
expression
universe
i
shall
take
a
phrase
of
the
universe
of
why
this
distinction
is
considered
necessary
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
but
even
of
treatises
on
the
really
limited
although
always
assumed
as
the
universe
of
i
know
none
in
which
a
survey
even
of
this
limited
universe
is
so
taken
as
to
warrant
deductions
from
its
the
nearest
approach
to
such
a
work
is
made
in
the
cosmos
of
alexander
von
humboldt
he
presents
the
subject
however
in
its
individuality
but
in
its
generality
his
theme
in
its
last
result
is
the
law
of
portion
of
the
merely
physical
universe
as
this
law
is
related
to
the
laws
of
portion
of
this
merely
physical
universe
his
design
is
simply
synœretical
in
a
word
he
discusses
the
universality
of
material
relation
and
discloses
to
the
eye
of
philosophy
whatever
inferences
have
hitherto
lain
hidden
this
universality
but
however
admirable
be
the
succinctness
with
which
he
has
treated
each
particular
point
of
his
topic
the
mere
multiplicity
of
these
points
occasions
necessarily
an
amount
of
detail
and
thus
an
involution
of
idea
which
precludes
all
of
impression
it
seems
to
me
that
in
aiming
at
this
latter
effect
and
through
it
at
the
if
nothing
better
offer
itself
the
mere
guesses
which
may
result
from
require
something
like
a
mental
gyration
on
the
heel
we
need
so
rapid
a
revolution
of
all
things
about
the
central
point
of
sight
that
while
the
minutiæ
vanish
altogether
even
the
more
conspicuous
objects
become
blended
into
one
among
the
vanishing
minutiæ
in
a
survey
of
this
kind
would
be
all
exclusively
terrestrial
matters
the
earth
would
be
considered
in
its
planetary
relations
alone
a
man
in
this
view
becomes
mankind
mankind
a
member
of
the
cosmical
family
of
intelligences
and
now
before
proceeding
to
our
subject
proper
let
me
beg
the
reader
s
attention
to
an
extract
or
two
from
a
somewhat
remarkable
letter
which
appears
to
have
been
found
corked
in
a
bottle
and
floating
on
the
ocean
well
described
by
the
nubian
geographer
ptolemy
hephestion
but
little
frequented
in
modern
days
unless
by
the
transcendentalists
and
some
other
divers
for
crotchets
the
date
of
this
letter
i
confess
surprises
me
even
more
particularly
than
its
contents
for
it
seems
to
have
been
written
in
the
year
thousand
eight
hundred
and
as
for
the
passages
i
am
about
to
transcribe
they
i
fancy
will
speak
for
themselves
do
you
know
my
dear
friend
says
the
writer
addressing
no
doubt
a
do
you
know
that
it
is
scarcely
more
than
eight
or
nine
hundred
years
ago
since
the
metaphysicians
first
consented
to
relieve
the
people
of
the
singular
fancy
that
there
exist
two
practicable
roads
to
believe
it
if
you
can
it
appears
however
that
long
long
ago
in
the
night
of
time
there
lived
a
turkish
philosopher
called
aries
and
surnamed
here
possibly
the
means
aristotle
the
best
names
are
wretchedly
corrupted
in
two
or
three
thousand
years
the
fame
of
this
great
man
depended
mainly
upon
his
demonstration
that
sneezing
is
a
natural
provision
by
means
of
which
thinkers
are
enabled
to
expel
superfluous
ideas
through
the
nose
but
he
obtained
a
scarcely
less
valuable
celebrity
as
the
founder
or
at
all
events
as
the
principal
propagator
of
what
was
termed
the
or
philosophy
he
started
with
what
he
maintained
to
be
axioms
or
truths
the
now
well
understood
fact
that
truths
are
really
does
not
make
in
the
slightest
degree
against
his
speculations
was
sufficient
for
his
purpose
that
the
truths
in
question
were
evident
at
all
from
axioms
he
proceeded
logically
to
results
his
most
illustrious
disciples
were
one
tuclid
a
geometrician
meaning
euclid
and
one
kant
a
dutchman
the
originator
of
that
species
of
transcendentalism
which
with
the
change
merely
of
a
c
for
a
k
now
bears
his
peculiar
name
well
aries
tottle
flourished
supreme
until
the
advent
of
one
hog
surnamed
the
ettrick
shepherd
who
preached
an
entirely
different
system
which
he
called
the
or
his
plan
referred
altogether
to
sensation
he
proceeded
by
observing
analyzing
and
classifying
as
they
were
somewhat
affectedly
arranging
them
into
general
laws
in
a
word
while
the
mode
of
aries
rested
on
that
of
hog
depended
on
and
so
great
was
the
admiration
excited
by
this
latter
system
that
at
its
first
introduction
aries
fell
into
general
disrepute
finally
however
he
recovered
ground
and
was
permitted
to
divide
the
empire
of
philosophy
with
his
more
modern
rival
savans
contenting
themselves
with
proscribing
all
competitors
past
present
and
to
come
putting
an
end
to
all
controversy
on
the
topic
by
the
promulgation
of
a
median
law
to
the
effect
that
the
aristotelian
and
baconian
roads
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
the
solo
possible
avenues
to
knowledge
baconian
you
must
know
my
dear
friend
adds
the
at
this
point
was
an
adjective
invented
as
equivalent
to
and
at
the
same
time
more
dignified
and
euphonious
now
i
do
assure
you
most
positively
the
that
i
represent
these
matters
fairly
and
you
can
easily
understand
how
restrictions
so
absurd
on
their
very
face
must
have
operated
in
those
days
to
retard
the
progress
of
true
science
which
makes
its
most
important
all
history
will
seemingly
intuitive
these
ancient
ideas
confined
investigation
to
crawling
and
i
need
not
suggest
to
you
that
crawling
among
varieties
of
locomotion
is
a
very
capital
thing
of
its
kind
because
the
tortoise
is
sure
of
foot
for
this
reason
must
we
clip
the
wings
of
the
eagles
for
many
centuries
so
great
was
the
infatuation
about
hog
especially
that
a
virtual
stop
was
put
to
all
thinking
properly
so
called
no
man
dared
utter
a
truth
for
which
he
felt
himself
indebted
to
his
soul
alone
it
mattered
not
whether
the
truth
was
even
demonstrably
such
for
the
dogmatizing
philosophers
of
that
epoch
regarded
only
by
which
it
professed
to
have
been
attained
the
end
with
them
was
a
point
of
no
moment
whatever
the
means
they
let
us
look
at
the
means
if
on
scrutiny
of
the
means
it
was
found
to
come
neither
under
the
category
hog
nor
under
the
category
aries
which
means
ram
why
then
the
savans
went
no
farther
but
calling
the
thinker
a
fool
and
branding
him
a
theorist
would
never
thenceforward
have
any
thing
to
do
either
with
or
with
his
truths
now
my
dear
friend
continues
the
it
can
not
be
maintained
that
by
the
crawling
system
exclusively
adopted
men
would
arrive
at
the
maximum
amount
of
truth
even
in
any
long
series
of
ages
for
the
repression
of
imagination
was
an
evil
not
to
be
counterbalanced
even
by
certainty
in
the
snail
processes
but
their
certainty
was
very
far
from
absolute
the
error
of
our
progenitors
was
quite
analogous
with
that
of
the
wiseacre
who
fancies
he
must
necessarily
see
an
object
the
more
distinctly
the
more
closely
he
holds
it
to
his
eyes
they
blinded
themselves
too
with
the
impalpable
titillating
scotch
snuff
of
and
thus
the
boasted
facts
of
the
were
by
no
means
always
point
of
little
importance
but
for
the
assumption
that
they
always
the
vital
taint
however
in
most
lamentable
fount
of
in
its
tendency
to
throw
power
and
consideration
into
the
hands
of
merely
perceptive
those
minnows
the
microscopical
diggers
and
pedlers
of
minute
for
the
most
part
in
physical
all
of
which
they
retailed
at
the
same
price
upon
the
highway
their
value
depending
it
was
supposed
simply
upon
the
of
their
without
reference
to
their
applicability
or
inapplicability
in
the
development
of
those
ultimate
and
only
legitimate
facts
called
law
than
the
persons
letter
goes
on
to
than
the
persons
thus
suddenly
elevated
by
the
philosophy
into
a
station
for
which
they
were
transferred
from
the
sculleries
into
the
parlors
of
its
pantries
into
its
these
individuals
a
more
more
intolerable
set
of
bigots
and
tyrants
never
existed
on
the
face
of
the
earth
their
creed
their
text
and
their
sermon
were
alike
the
one
word
for
the
most
part
even
of
this
one
word
they
knew
not
even
the
meaning
on
those
who
ventured
to
their
facts
with
the
view
of
putting
them
in
order
and
to
use
the
disciples
of
hog
had
no
mercy
whatever
all
attempts
at
generalization
were
met
at
once
by
the
words
theoretical
theory
theorist
to
be
brief
was
very
properly
resented
as
a
personal
affront
to
themselves
cultivating
the
natural
sciences
to
the
exclusion
of
metaphysics
the
mathematics
and
logic
many
of
these
and
lame
of
a
more
wretchedly
miserably
ignorant
in
view
of
all
the
comprehensible
objects
of
knowledge
than
the
veriest
unlettered
hind
who
proves
that
he
knows
something
at
least
in
admitting
that
he
knows
absolutely
nothing
nor
had
our
forefathers
any
better
right
to
talk
about
when
pursuing
in
blind
confidence
the
path
of
axioms
or
of
the
ram
at
innumerable
points
this
path
was
scarcely
as
straight
as
a
ram
the
simple
truth
is
that
the
aristotelians
erected
their
castles
upon
a
basis
far
less
reliable
than
air
no
such
things
as
axioms
ever
existed
or
can
possibly
exist
at
this
they
must
have
been
very
blind
indeed
not
to
see
or
at
least
to
suspect
for
even
in
their
own
day
many
of
their
axioms
had
been
abandoned
nihilo
nihil
for
example
and
a
thing
can
not
act
where
it
is
not
and
there
can
not
be
antipodes
and
darkness
can
not
proceed
from
these
and
numerous
similar
propositions
formerly
accepted
without
hesitation
as
axioms
or
undeniable
truths
were
even
at
the
period
of
which
i
speak
seen
to
be
altogether
untenable
absurd
in
these
people
then
to
persist
in
relying
upon
a
basis
as
immutable
whose
mutability
had
become
so
repeatedly
manifest
but
even
through
evidence
afforded
by
themselves
against
themselves
it
is
easy
to
convict
these
reasoners
of
the
grossest
is
easy
to
show
the
impalpability
of
their
axioms
in
general
i
have
now
lying
before
me
will
be
observed
that
we
still
proceed
with
the
i
have
now
lying
before
me
a
book
printed
about
a
thousand
years
ago
pundit
assures
me
that
it
is
decidedly
the
cleverest
ancient
work
on
its
topic
which
is
the
author
who
was
much
esteemed
in
his
day
was
one
miller
or
mill
and
we
find
it
recorded
of
him
as
a
point
of
some
importance
that
he
rode
a
whom
he
called
jeremy
bentham
let
us
glance
at
the
volume
itself
ah
ability
or
inability
to
conceive
says
mill
very
properly
is
no
to
be
received
as
a
criterion
of
axiomatic
now
that
this
is
a
palpable
truism
no
one
in
his
senses
will
deny
to
admit
the
proposition
is
to
insinuate
a
charge
of
variability
in
truth
itself
whose
very
title
is
a
synonym
of
the
steadfast
if
ability
to
conceive
be
taken
as
a
criterion
of
truth
then
a
truth
to
hume
would
very
seldom
be
a
truth
to
and
hundredths
of
what
is
undeniable
in
heaven
would
be
demonstrable
falsity
upon
earth
the
proposition
of
mill
then
is
sustained
i
will
not
grant
it
to
be
an
and
this
merely
because
i
am
showing
that
axioms
exist
but
with
a
distinction
which
could
not
have
been
cavilled
at
even
by
mill
himself
i
am
ready
to
grant
that
an
axiom
then
the
proposition
of
which
we
speak
has
the
fullest
right
to
be
considered
an
no
absolute
axiom
consequently
that
any
subsequent
proposition
which
shall
conflict
with
this
one
primarily
advanced
must
be
either
a
falsity
in
is
to
say
no
if
admitted
axiomatic
must
at
once
neutralize
both
itself
and
its
predecessor
and
now
by
the
logic
of
their
own
propounder
let
us
proceed
to
test
any
one
of
the
axioms
propounded
let
us
give
mill
the
fairest
of
play
we
will
bring
the
point
to
no
ordinary
issue
we
will
select
for
investigation
no
axiom
of
what
not
the
less
preposterously
because
only
impliedly
he
terms
his
secondary
if
a
positive
truth
by
definition
could
be
either
more
or
less
positively
a
truth
will
select
i
say
no
axiom
of
an
unquestionability
so
questionable
as
is
to
be
found
in
euclid
we
will
not
talk
for
example
about
such
propositions
as
that
two
straight
lines
can
not
enclose
a
space
or
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
any
one
of
its
parts
we
will
afford
the
logician
advantage
we
will
come
at
once
to
a
proposition
which
he
regards
as
the
acme
of
the
the
quintessence
of
axiomatic
undeniability
here
it
is
contradictions
can
not
be
is
can
not
cöexist
in
here
mill
means
for
instance
i
give
the
most
forcible
instance
a
tree
must
be
either
a
tree
or
a
it
can
not
be
at
the
same
time
a
tree
not
a
tree
which
is
quite
reasonable
of
itself
and
will
answer
remarkably
well
as
an
axiom
until
we
bring
it
into
collation
with
an
axiom
insisted
upon
a
few
pages
other
which
i
have
previously
we
test
it
by
the
logic
of
its
own
propounder
a
tree
mill
asserts
must
be
either
a
tree
or
a
very
well
now
let
me
ask
him
to
this
little
query
there
is
but
one
response
defy
any
man
living
to
invent
a
second
the
sole
answer
is
this
because
we
find
it
to
that
a
tree
can
be
any
thing
else
than
a
tree
or
not
a
this
i
repeat
is
mill
s
sole
answer
will
not
to
suggest
another
yet
by
his
own
showing
his
answer
is
clearly
no
answer
at
all
for
has
he
not
already
required
us
to
admit
an
that
ability
or
inability
to
conceive
is
no
to
be
taken
as
a
criterion
of
axiomatic
truth
thus
his
argumentation
is
at
sea
without
a
rudder
let
it
not
be
urged
that
an
exception
from
the
general
rule
is
to
be
made
in
cases
where
the
impossibility
to
conceive
is
so
peculiarly
great
as
when
we
are
called
upon
to
conceive
a
tree
a
tree
and
a
tree
let
no
attempt
i
say
be
made
at
urging
this
sotticism
for
in
the
first
place
there
are
no
of
impossibility
and
thus
no
one
impossible
conception
can
be
peculiarly
impossible
than
another
impossible
conception
the
second
place
mill
himself
no
doubt
after
thorough
deliberation
has
most
distinctly
and
most
rationally
excluded
all
opportunity
for
exception
by
the
emphasis
of
his
proposition
that
no
is
ability
or
inability
to
conceive
to
be
taken
as
a
criterion
of
axiomatic
truth
the
third
place
even
were
exceptions
admissible
at
all
it
remains
to
be
shown
how
any
exception
is
admissible
that
a
tree
can
be
both
a
tree
and
not
a
tree
is
an
idea
which
the
angels
or
the
devils
entertain
and
which
no
doubt
many
an
earthly
bedlamite
or
transcendentalist
now
i
do
not
quarrel
with
these
ancients
continues
the
on
account
of
the
transparent
frivolity
of
their
to
be
plain
was
baseless
worthless
and
fantastic
on
account
of
their
pompous
and
infatuate
proscription
of
all
roads
to
truth
than
the
two
narrow
and
crooked
one
of
creeping
and
the
other
of
which
in
their
ignorant
perversity
they
have
dared
to
confine
the
soul
which
loves
nothing
so
well
as
to
soar
in
those
regions
of
illimitable
intuition
which
are
utterly
incognizant
of
by
the
bye
my
dear
friend
is
it
not
an
evidence
of
the
mental
slavery
entailed
upon
those
bigoted
people
by
their
hogs
and
rams
that
in
spite
of
the
eternal
prating
of
their
savans
about
to
truth
none
of
them
fell
even
by
accident
into
what
we
now
so
distinctly
perceive
to
be
the
broadest
the
straightest
and
most
available
of
all
mere
great
majestic
highway
of
the
is
it
not
wonderful
that
they
should
have
failed
to
deduce
from
the
works
of
god
the
vitally
momentous
consideration
that
perfect
consistency
can
be
nothing
but
an
absolute
how
rapid
our
progress
since
the
late
announcement
of
this
proposition
by
its
means
investigation
has
been
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
and
given
as
a
duty
rather
than
as
a
task
to
the
the
true
the
men
of
ardent
imagination
these
speculate
theorize
are
the
you
not
fancy
the
shout
of
scorn
with
which
they
would
be
received
by
our
progenitors
were
it
possible
for
them
to
be
looking
over
my
shoulders
as
i
write
the
keplers
i
repeat
their
theories
are
merely
little
by
little
of
their
chaff
of
at
length
there
stands
apparent
an
unencumbered
consistency
which
the
most
stolid
it
a
be
an
absolute
and
an
unquestionable
i
have
often
thought
my
friend
that
it
must
have
puzzled
these
dogmaticians
of
a
thousand
years
ago
to
determine
even
by
which
of
their
two
boasted
roads
it
is
that
the
cryptographist
attains
the
solution
of
the
more
complicate
by
which
of
them
champollion
guided
mankind
to
those
important
and
innumerable
truths
which
for
so
many
centuries
have
lain
entombed
amid
the
phonetical
hieroglyphics
of
egypt
in
especial
would
it
not
have
given
these
bigots
some
trouble
to
determine
by
which
of
their
two
roads
was
reached
the
most
momentous
and
sublime
of
their
fact
of
newton
deduced
it
from
the
laws
of
kepler
kepler
admitted
that
these
laws
he
laws
whose
investigation
disclosed
to
the
greatest
of
british
astronomers
that
principle
the
basis
of
all
existing
physical
principle
in
going
behind
which
we
enter
at
once
the
nebulous
kingdom
of

yes
vital

kepler

to

he

he
been

to
point
out
either
the

route
by
which

alas
poor
ignorant
old
man
could
not
any
metaphysician
have
told
him
that
what
he
called
intuition
was
but
the
conviction
resulting
from
or
of
which
the
processes
were
so
shadowy
as
to
have
escaped
his
consciousness
eluded
his

to
his
capacity
of

how
great
a
pity
it
is
that
some
moral
philosopher
had
not
enlightened
him
about
all
this
how
it
would
have
comforted
him
on
his
to
know
that
instead
of
having
gone
intuitively
and
thus
unbecomingly
he
had
in
fact
proceeded
decorously
and

to
say
or
at

the
vast
halls
where
lay
gleaming
untended
and
hitherto
untouched
by
mortal
by
mortal
imperishable
and
priceless
secrets
of
the
universe
yes
kepler
was
essentially
a
but
this
title
of
so
much
sanctity
was
in
those
ancient
days
a
designation
of
supreme
contempt
it
is
only
that
men
begin
to
appreciate
that
divine
old
sympathize
with
the
prophetical
and
poetical
rhapsody
of
his
words
for
part
continues
the
unknown
correspondent
i
glow
with
a
sacred
fire
when
i
even
think
of
them
and
feel
that
i
shall
never
grow
weary
of
their
repetition
concluding
this
letter
let
me
have
the
real
pleasure
of
transcribing
them
once
again
care
not
whether
my
work
be
read
now
or
by
posterity
i
can
afford
to
wait
a
century
for
readers
when
god
himself
has
waited
six
thousand
years
for
an
observer
i
triumph
i
have
stolen
the
golden
secret
of
the
egyptians
i
will
indulge
my
sacred
here
end
my
quotations
from
this
very
unaccountable
and
perhaps
somewhat
impertinent
epistle
and
perhaps
it
would
be
folly
to
comment
in
any
respect
upon
the
chimerical
not
to
say
revolutionary
fancies
of
the
he
so
radically
at
war
with
the
and
opinions
of
this
age
let
us
proceed
then
to
our
legitimate
thesis
this
thesis
admits
a
choice
between
two
modes
of
discussion
may
or
beginning
at
our
own
point
of
the
earth
on
which
we
may
pass
to
the
other
planets
of
our
to
the
to
our
system
considered
thence
through
other
systems
indefinitely
outwards
or
commencing
on
high
at
some
point
as
definite
as
we
can
make
it
or
conceive
it
we
may
come
down
to
the
habitation
of
man
is
to
say
in
ordinary
essays
on
first
of
these
two
modes
is
with
certain
reservation
adopted
for
the
obvious
reason
that
astronomical
merely
and
principles
being
the
object
that
object
is
best
fulfilled
in
stepping
from
the
known
because
proximate
gradually
onward
to
the
point
where
all
certitude
becomes
lost
in
the
remote
for
my
present
purpose
however
of
enabling
the
mind
to
take
in
as
if
from
afar
and
at
one
glance
a
distinct
conception
of
the
is
clear
that
a
descent
to
small
from
the
outskirts
from
the
centre
if
we
could
establish
a
centre
the
end
from
the
beginning
if
we
could
fancy
a
beginning
would
be
the
preferable
course
but
for
the
difficulty
if
not
impossibility
of
presenting
in
this
course
to
the
unastronomical
a
picture
at
all
comprehensible
in
regard
to
such
considerations
as
are
involved
in
is
to
say
in
number
magnitude
and
distance
now
at
all
points
is
a
primary
feature
in
my
general
design
on
important
topics
it
is
better
to
be
a
good
deal
prolix
than
even
a
very
little
obscure
but
abstruseness
is
a
quality
appertaining
to
no
subject
all
are
alike
in
facility
of
comprehension
to
him
who
approaches
them
by
properly
graduated
steps
it
is
merely
because
a
here
and
there
is
heedlessly
left
unsupplied
in
our
road
to
the
differential
calculus
that
this
latter
is
not
altogether
as
simple
a
thing
as
a
sonnet
by
solomon
seesaw
by
way
of
admitting
then
no
for
misapprehension
i
think
it
advisable
to
proceed
as
if
even
the
more
obvious
facts
of
astronomy
were
unknown
to
the
reader
in
combining
the
two
modes
of
discussion
to
which
i
have
referred
i
propose
to
avail
myself
of
the
advantages
peculiar
to
very
especially
of
the
in
which
will
be
unavoidable
as
a
consequence
of
the
plan
commencing
with
a
descent
i
shall
reserve
for
the
return
upwards
those
indispensable
considerations
of
to
which
allusion
has
already
been
made
let
us
begin
then
at
once
with
that
merest
of
words
this
like
god
spirit
and
some
other
expressions
of
which
the
equivalents
exist
in
all
languages
is
by
no
means
the
expression
of
an
of
an
effort
at
one
it
stands
for
the
possible
attempt
at
an
impossible
conception
man
needed
a
term
by
which
to
point
out
the
of
this
cloud
behind
which
lay
forever
invisible
the
of
this
attempt
a
word
in
fine
was
demanded
by
means
of
which
one
human
being
might
put
himself
in
relation
at
once
with
another
human
being
and
with
a
certain
of
the
human
intellect
out
of
this
demand
arose
the
word
infinity
which
is
thus
the
representative
but
of
the
of
a
as
regards
infinity
now
infinity
of
often
hear
it
said
that
its
idea
is
admitted
by
the
acquiesced
account
of
the
greater
difficulty
which
attends
the
conception
of
a
but
this
is
merely
one
of
those
by
which
even
profound
thinkers
time
out
of
mind
have
occasionally
taken
pleasure
in
deceiving
the
quibble
lies
concealed
in
the
word
the
mind
we
are
told
entertains
the
idea
of
through
the
greater
which
it
finds
in
entertaining
that
of
now
were
the
proposition
but
fairly
its
absurdity
would
become
transparent
at
once
clearly
there
is
no
mere
in
the
case
the
assertion
intended
if
presented
to
its
intention
and
without
sophistry
would
run
thus
the
mind
admits
the
idea
of
limitless
through
the
greater
of
entertaining
that
of
limited
it
must
be
immediately
seen
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
two
statements
between
whose
respective
of
two
arguments
between
whose
respective
is
called
upon
to
decide
is
a
matter
of
two
conceptions
directly
conflicting
and
each
avowedly
impossible
one
of
which
the
is
supposed
to
be
capable
of
entertaining
on
account
of
the
greater
of
entertaining
the
other
the
choice
is
made
between
two
difficulties
is
merely
to
be
made
between
two
impossibilities
now
of
the
former
there
of
the
latter
none
as
our
impertinent
has
already
suggested
a
task
be
more
or
less
difficult
but
it
is
either
possible
or
not
possible
are
no
gradations
it
be
more
to
overthrow
the
andes
than
an
but
it
be
no
more
to
annihilate
the
matter
of
the
one
than
the
matter
of
the
other
a
man
may
jump
ten
feet
with
less
than
he
can
jump
twenty
but
the
of
his
leaping
to
the
moon
is
not
a
whit
less
than
that
of
his
leaping
to
the
since
all
this
is
undeniable
since
the
choice
of
the
mind
is
to
be
made
between
of
conception
since
one
impossibility
can
not
be
greater
than
another
and
since
thus
one
can
not
be
preferred
to
another
the
philosophers
who
not
only
maintain
on
the
grounds
mentioned
man
s
of
infinity
but
on
account
of
such
supposititious
idea
plainly
engaged
in
demonstrating
one
impossible
thing
to
be
possible
by
showing
how
it
is
that
some
one
other
impossible
too
this
it
will
be
said
is
nonsense
and
perhaps
it
is
i
think
it
very
capital
forego
all
claim
to
it
as
nonsense
of
mine
the
readiest
mode
however
of
displaying
the
fallacy
of
the
philosophical
argument
on
this
question
is
by
simply
adverting
to
a
respecting
it
which
has
been
hitherto
quite
fact
that
the
argument
alluded
to
both
proves
and
disproves
its
own
proposition
the
mind
is
impelled
say
the
theologians
and
others
to
admit
a
by
the
superior
difficulty
it
experiences
in
conceiving
cause
beyond
cause
without
the
quibble
as
before
lies
in
the
word
difficulty
what
is
it
employed
to
sustain
a
first
cause
and
what
is
a
first
cause
an
ultimate
termination
of
causes
and
what
is
an
ultimate
termination
of
causes
finite
thus
the
one
quibble
in
two
processes
by
god
knows
how
many
philosophers
is
made
to
support
now
finity
and
now
it
not
be
brought
to
support
something
besides
as
for
the
at
least
are
insupportable
dismiss
them
they
prove
in
the
one
case
is
the
identical
nothing
which
they
demonstrate
in
the
other
of
course
no
one
will
suppose
that
i
here
contend
for
the
absolute
impossibility
of
which
we
attempt
to
convey
in
the
word
my
purpose
is
but
to
show
the
folly
of
endeavoring
to
prove
infinity
itself
or
even
our
conception
of
it
by
any
such
blundering
ratiocination
as
that
which
is
ordinarily
employed
nevertheless
as
an
individual
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
that
conceive
infinity
and
am
convinced
that
no
human
being
can
a
mind
not
thoroughly
accustomed
to
the
introspective
analysis
of
its
own
it
is
true
often
deceive
itself
by
supposing
that
it
entertained
the
conception
of
which
we
speak
in
the
effort
to
entertain
it
we
proceed
step
beyond
fancy
point
still
beyond
point
and
so
long
as
we
the
effort
it
may
be
said
in
fact
that
we
are
to
the
formation
of
the
idea
designed
while
the
strength
of
the
impression
that
we
actually
form
or
have
formed
it
is
in
the
ratio
of
the
period
during
which
we
keep
up
the
mental
endeavor
but
it
is
in
the
act
of
discontinuing
the
fulfilling
as
we
think
the
putting
the
finishing
stroke
as
we
suppose
to
the
we
overthrow
at
once
the
whole
fabric
of
our
fancy
by
resting
upon
some
one
ultimate
and
therefore
definite
point
this
fact
however
we
fail
to
perceive
on
account
of
the
absolute
coincidence
in
time
between
the
settling
down
upon
the
ultimate
point
and
the
act
of
cessation
in
attempting
on
the
other
hand
to
frame
the
idea
of
a
space
we
merely
converse
the
processes
which
involve
the
impossibility
we
in
a
god
we
may
or
may
not
in
finite
or
in
infinite
space
but
our
belief
in
such
cases
is
more
properly
designated
as
and
is
a
matter
quite
distinct
from
that
belief
that
presupposes
the
mental
conception
the
fact
is
that
upon
the
enunciation
of
any
one
of
that
class
of
terms
to
which
infinity
class
representing
of
who
has
a
right
to
say
that
he
thinks
feels
himself
called
upon
to
entertain
a
conception
but
simply
to
direct
his
mental
vision
toward
some
given
point
in
the
intellectual
firmament
where
lies
a
nebula
never
to
be
resolved
to
solve
it
indeed
he
makes
no
effort
for
with
a
rapid
instinct
he
comprehends
not
only
the
impossibility
but
as
regards
all
human
purposes
the
of
its
solution
he
perceives
that
the
deity
has
not
it
to
be
solved
he
sees
at
once
that
it
lies
of
the
brain
of
man
and
even
if
not
exactly
it
lies
out
of
it
there
people
i
am
aware
who
busying
themselves
in
attempts
at
the
unattainable
acquire
very
easily
by
dint
of
the
jargon
they
emit
among
those
with
whom
darkness
and
depth
are
synonymous
a
kind
of
reputation
for
profundity
but
the
finest
quality
of
thought
is
its
and
with
some
little
equivocation
it
may
be
said
that
no
fog
of
the
mind
can
well
be
greater
than
that
which
extending
to
the
very
boundaries
of
the
mental
domain
shuts
out
even
these
boundaries
themselves
from
comprehension
it
will
now
be
understood
that
in
using
the
phrase
infinity
of
space
i
make
no
call
upon
the
reader
to
entertain
the
impossible
conception
of
an
infinity
i
refer
simply
to
the
conceivable
of
shadowy
and
fluctuating
domain
now
shrinking
now
swelling
in
accordance
with
the
vacillating
energies
of
the
imagination
the
universe
of
stars
has
always
been
considered
as
coincident
with
the
universe
proper
as
i
have
defined
it
in
the
commencement
of
this
discourse
it
has
been
always
either
directly
or
indirectly
least
since
the
dawn
of
intelligible
were
it
possible
for
us
to
attain
any
given
point
in
space
we
should
still
find
on
all
sides
of
us
an
interminable
succession
of
stars
this
was
the
untenable
idea
of
pascal
when
making
perhaps
the
most
successful
attempt
ever
made
at
periphrasing
the
conception
for
which
we
struggle
in
the
word
it
is
a
sphere
he
says
of
which
the
centre
is
everywhere
the
circumference
but
although
this
intended
definition
is
in
fact
definition
of
the
universe
of
we
may
accept
it
with
some
mental
reservation
as
a
definition
rigorous
enough
for
all
practical
purposes
of
the
universe
is
to
say
of
the
universe
of
this
latter
then
let
us
regard
as
sphere
of
which
the
centre
is
everywhere
the
circumference
in
fact
while
we
find
it
impossible
to
fancy
an
to
space
we
have
no
difficulty
in
picturing
to
ourselves
any
one
of
an
infinity
of
as
our
then
let
us
adopt
the
of
this
godhead
he
alone
is
not
alone
is
not
impious
who
ne
connaissons
says
the
baron
de
ne
connaissons
rien
de
la
nature
ou
de
l
essence
de
dieu
savoir
ce
qu
il
est
il
faut
être
dieu
we
know
absolutely
of
the
nature
or
essence
of
god
order
to
comprehend
what
he
is
we
should
have
to
be
god
should
have
to
be
god
ourselves
a
phrase
so
startling
as
this
yet
ringing
in
my
ears
i
nevertheless
venture
to
demand
if
this
our
present
ignorance
of
the
deity
is
an
ignorance
to
which
the
soul
is
condemned
by
at
least
the
him
as
is
to
say
as
distinction
which
for
all
intelligible
purposes
will
stand
well
instead
of
a
him
then
existing
as
spirit
let
us
content
ourselves
with
supposing
to
have
been
or
made
out
of
nothing
by
dint
of
his
some
point
of
space
which
we
will
take
as
a
some
period
into
which
we
do
not
pretend
to
inquire
but
at
all
events
immensely
him
then
again
let
us
suppose
to
have
been
this
is
a
vitally
momentous
epoch
in
our
considerations
is
it
that
we
are
alone
we
are
justified
in
supposing
to
have
been
primarily
and
solely
we
have
attained
a
point
where
only
can
aid
us
now
let
me
recur
to
the
idea
which
i
have
already
suggested
as
that
alone
which
we
can
properly
entertain
of
intuition
it
is
but
conviction
arising
from
those
inductions
or
deductions
of
which
the
processes
are
so
shadowy
as
to
escape
our
consciousness
elude
our
reason
or
defy
our
capacity
of
with
this
understanding
i
now
an
intuition
altogether
irresistible
although
inexpressible
forces
me
to
the
conclusion
that
what
god
originally
that
matter
which
by
dint
of
his
volition
he
first
made
from
his
spirit
or
from
nihility
have
been
nothing
but
matter
in
its
utmost
conceivable
state
this
will
be
found
the
sole
absolute
of
my
discourse
i
use
the
word
assumption
in
its
ordinary
sense
yet
i
maintain
that
even
this
my
primary
proposition
is
very
very
far
indeed
from
being
really
a
mere
assumption
nothing
was
ever
more
human
conclusion
was
ever
in
fact
more
rigorously
alas
the
processes
lie
out
of
the
human
all
events
are
beyond
the
utterance
of
the
human
tongue
let
us
now
endeavor
to
conceive
what
matter
must
be
when
or
if
in
its
absolute
extreme
of
here
the
reason
flies
at
once
to
a
particle
of
one
particle
therefore
form
and
void
particle
positively
a
particle
at
all
particle
absolutely
unique
individual
undivided
and
not
indivisible
only
because
he
who
it
by
dint
of
his
will
can
by
an
infinitely
less
energetic
exercise
of
the
same
will
as
a
matter
of
course
divide
it
then
is
all
that
i
predicate
of
the
originally
created
matter
but
i
propose
to
show
that
this
is
a
principle
abundantly
sufficient
to
account
for
the
constitution
the
existing
phænomena
and
the
plainly
inevitable
annihilation
of
at
least
the
material
the
willing
into
being
the
primordial
particle
has
completed
the
act
or
more
properly
the
of
creation
we
now
proceed
to
the
ultimate
purpose
for
which
we
are
to
suppose
the
particle
is
to
say
the
ultimate
purpose
so
far
as
our
considerations
enable
us
to
see
constitution
of
the
universe
from
it
the
particle
this
constitution
has
been
effected
by
the
originally
and
therefore
normally
into
the
abnormal
condition
of
an
action
of
this
character
implies
rëaction
a
diffusion
from
unity
under
the
conditions
involves
a
tendency
to
return
into
tendency
ineradicable
until
satisfied
but
on
these
points
i
will
speak
more
fully
hereafter
the
assumption
of
absolute
unity
in
the
primordial
particle
includes
that
of
infinite
divisibility
let
us
conceive
the
particle
then
to
be
only
not
totally
exhausted
by
diffusion
into
space
from
the
one
particle
as
a
centre
let
us
suppose
to
be
irradiated
all
immeasurable
but
still
to
definite
distances
in
the
previously
vacant
certain
inexpressibly
great
yet
limited
number
of
unimaginably
yet
not
infinitely
minute
atoms
now
of
these
atoms
thus
diffused
or
upon
diffusion
what
conditions
are
we
to
assume
but
to
infer
from
consideration
as
well
of
their
source
as
of
the
character
of
the
design
apparent
in
their
diffusion
being
their
source
and
from
the
character
of
the
design
manifested
in
their
diffusion
we
are
warranted
in
supposing
this
character
to
be
at
least
preserved
throughout
the
design
and
to
form
a
portion
of
the
design
itself
is
to
say
we
shall
be
warranted
in
conceiving
continual
differences
at
all
points
from
the
uniquity
and
simplicity
of
the
origin
but
for
these
reasons
shall
we
be
justified
in
imagining
the
atoms
heterogeneous
dissimilar
unequal
and
inequidistant
more
we
to
consider
no
two
atoms
as
at
their
diffusion
of
the
same
nature
or
of
the
same
form
or
of
the
same
size
after
fulfilment
of
their
diffusion
into
space
is
absolute
inequidistance
each
from
each
to
be
understood
of
all
of
them
in
such
arrangement
under
such
conditions
we
most
easily
and
immediately
comprehend
the
subsequent
most
feasible
carrying
out
to
completion
of
any
such
design
as
that
which
i
have
design
of
variety
out
of
out
of
out
of
out
of
a
word
the
utmost
possible
multiplicity
of
out
of
the
emphatically
irrelative
undoubtedly
therefore
we
be
warranted
in
assuming
all
that
has
been
mentioned
but
for
the
reflection
first
that
supererogation
is
not
presumable
of
any
divine
act
and
secondly
that
the
object
supposed
in
view
appears
as
feasible
when
some
of
the
conditions
in
question
are
dispensed
with
in
the
beginning
as
when
all
are
understood
immediately
to
exist
i
mean
to
say
that
some
are
involved
in
the
rest
or
so
instantaneous
a
consequence
of
them
as
to
make
the
distinction
inappreciable
difference
of
for
example
will
at
once
be
brought
about
through
the
tendency
of
one
atom
to
a
second
in
preference
to
a
third
on
account
of
particular
inequidistance
which
is
to
be
comprehended
as
inequidistances
between
centres
of
quantity
in
neighboring
atoms
of
different
matter
not
at
all
interfering
with
the
distribution
of
the
atoms
difference
of
too
is
easily
conceived
to
be
merely
a
result
of
differences
in
size
and
form
taken
more
or
less
conjointly
fact
since
the
of
the
particle
proper
implies
absolute
homogeneity
we
can
not
imagine
the
atoms
at
their
diffusion
differing
in
kind
without
imagining
at
the
same
time
a
special
exercise
of
the
divine
will
at
the
emission
of
each
atom
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
in
each
a
change
of
its
essential
nature
fantastic
an
idea
is
the
less
to
be
indulged
as
the
object
proposed
is
seen
to
be
thoroughly
attainable
without
such
minute
and
elaborate
interposition
we
perceive
therefore
upon
the
whole
that
it
would
be
supererogatory
and
consequently
unphilosophical
to
predicate
of
the
atoms
in
view
of
their
purposes
any
thing
more
than
of
at
their
dispersion
with
particular
inequidistance
after
other
differences
arising
at
once
out
of
these
in
the
very
first
processes
of
thus
establish
the
universe
on
a
purely
basis
of
course
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
assume
absolute
difference
even
of
form
among
the
atoms
more
than
absolute
particular
inequidistance
of
each
from
each
we
are
required
to
conceive
merely
that
no
atoms
are
of
similar
atoms
which
can
ever
approximate
until
their
inevitable
rëunition
at
the
end
although
the
immediate
and
perpetual
of
the
disunited
atoms
to
return
into
their
normal
unity
is
implied
as
i
have
said
in
their
abnormal
diffusion
still
it
is
clear
that
this
tendency
will
be
without
tendency
and
no
the
diffusive
energy
in
ceasing
to
be
exerted
shall
leave
the
tendency
free
to
seek
its
satisfaction
the
divine
act
however
being
considered
as
determinate
and
discontinued
on
fulfilment
of
the
diffusion
we
understand
at
once
a
other
words
a
tendency
of
the
disunited
atoms
to
return
into
but
the
diffusive
energy
being
withdrawn
and
the
rëaction
having
commenced
in
furtherance
of
the
ultimate
of
the
utmost
possible
design
is
now
in
danger
of
being
frustrated
in
detail
by
reason
of
that
very
tendency
to
return
which
is
to
effect
its
accomplishment
in
general
is
the
object
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
proximate
atoms
from
lapsing
through
the
now
satisfiable
the
fulfilment
of
any
ends
proposed
in
absolute
oneness
among
themselves
is
nothing
to
impede
the
aggregation
of
various
masses
at
various
points
of
space
other
words
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
accumulation
of
various
masses
each
absolutely
one
for
the
effectual
and
thorough
completion
of
the
general
design
we
thus
see
the
necessity
for
a
repulsion
of
limited
separative
which
on
withdrawal
of
the
diffusive
volition
shall
at
the
same
time
allow
the
approach
and
forbid
the
junction
of
the
atoms
suffering
them
infinitely
to
approximate
while
denying
them
positive
contact
in
a
word
having
the
to
a
certain
preventing
their
but
no
ability
to
interfere
with
their
in
any
respect
the
repulsion
already
considered
as
so
peculiarly
limited
in
other
regards
must
be
understood
let
me
repeat
as
having
power
to
prevent
absolute
coalition
up
to
a
certain
unless
we
are
to
conceive
that
the
appetite
for
unity
among
the
atoms
is
doomed
to
be
satisfied
we
are
to
conceive
that
what
had
a
beginning
is
to
have
no
conception
which
can
not
be
entertained
however
much
we
may
talk
or
dream
of
entertaining
are
forced
to
conclude
that
the
repulsive
influence
imagined
will
pressure
of
the
applied
but
never
and
in
no
degree
on
fulfilment
of
the
divine
purposes
such
collective
application
shall
be
naturally
to
a
force
which
at
that
ultimate
epoch
shall
be
the
superior
force
precisely
to
the
extent
required
and
thus
permit
the
universal
subsidence
into
the
inevitable
because
original
and
therefore
normal
conditions
here
to
be
reconciled
are
difficult
indeed
can
not
even
comprehend
the
possibility
of
their
conciliation
the
apparent
impossibility
is
brilliantly
suggestive
that
the
repulsive
something
actually
exists
man
neither
employs
nor
knows
a
force
sufficient
to
bring
two
atoms
into
contact
this
is
but
the
proposition
of
the
impenetrability
of
matter
all
experiment
philosophy
admits
it
the
of
the
necessity
for
its
have
endeavored
to
show
but
from
all
attempt
at
investigating
its
nature
have
religiously
abstained
this
on
account
of
an
intuitive
conviction
that
the
principle
at
issue
is
strictly
in
a
recess
impervious
to
our
present
involved
in
a
consideration
of
what
our
human
to
be
a
consideration
of
in
i
feel
in
a
word
that
here
the
god
has
interposed
and
here
only
because
here
and
here
only
the
knot
demanded
the
interposition
of
the
god
in
fact
while
the
tendency
of
the
diffused
atoms
to
return
into
unity
will
be
recognized
at
once
as
the
principle
of
the
newtonian
gravity
what
i
have
spoken
of
as
a
repulsive
influence
prescribing
limits
to
the
immediate
satisfaction
of
the
tendency
will
be
understood
as
which
we
have
been
in
the
practice
of
designating
now
as
heat
now
as
magnetism
now
as
displaying
our
ignorance
of
its
awful
character
in
the
vacillation
of
the
phraseology
with
which
we
endeavor
to
circumscribe
it
calling
it
merely
for
the
moment
electricity
we
know
that
all
experimental
analysis
of
electricity
has
given
as
an
ultimate
result
the
principle
or
seeming
principle
where
things
differ
is
electricity
apparent
and
it
is
presumable
that
they
differ
where
it
is
not
developed
at
least
if
not
apparent
now
this
result
is
in
the
fullest
keeping
with
that
which
i
have
reached
unempirically
the
design
of
the
repulsive
influence
i
have
maintained
to
be
that
of
preventing
immediate
unity
among
the
diffused
atoms
and
these
atoms
are
represented
as
different
each
from
each
is
their
as
was
the
essentiality
of
their
source
when
we
say
then
that
an
attempt
to
bring
any
two
of
these
atoms
together
would
induce
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
repulsive
influence
to
prevent
the
contact
we
may
as
well
use
the
strictly
convertible
sentence
that
an
attempt
to
bring
together
any
two
differences
will
result
in
a
development
of
electricity
all
existing
bodies
of
course
are
composed
of
these
atoms
in
proximate
contact
and
are
therefore
to
be
considered
as
mere
assemblages
of
more
or
fewer
differences
and
the
resistance
made
by
the
repulsive
spirit
on
bringing
together
any
two
such
assemblages
would
be
in
the
ratio
of
the
two
sums
of
the
differences
in
each
expression
which
when
reduced
is
equivalent
to
this
amount
of
electricity
developed
on
the
approximation
of
two
bodies
is
proportional
to
the
difference
between
the
respective
sums
of
the
atoms
of
which
the
bodies
are
that
two
bodies
are
absolutely
alike
is
a
simple
corollary
from
all
that
has
been
here
said
electricity
therefore
existing
always
is
whenever
bodies
but
only
when
bodies
of
appreciable
difference
are
brought
into
approximation
to
for
the
present
continuing
to
call
not
be
wrong
in
referring
the
various
physical
appearances
of
light
heat
and
magnetism
but
far
less
shall
we
be
liable
to
err
in
attributing
to
this
strictly
spiritual
principle
the
more
important
phænomena
of
vitality
consciousness
and
on
this
topic
however
i
need
pause
merely
to
suggest
that
these
phænomena
whether
observed
generally
or
in
detail
seem
to
proceed
least
in
the
ratio
of
the
discarding
now
the
two
equivocal
terms
gravitation
and
electricity
let
us
adopt
the
more
definite
expressions
and
the
former
is
the
body
the
latter
the
soul
the
one
is
the
material
the
other
the
spiritual
principle
of
the
universe
other
principles
phænomena
are
referable
to
one
or
to
the
other
or
to
both
combined
so
rigorously
is
this
the
thoroughly
demonstrable
is
it
that
attraction
and
repulsion
are
the
properties
through
which
we
perceive
the
other
words
by
which
matter
is
manifested
to
for
all
merely
argumentative
purposes
we
are
fully
justified
in
assuming
that
matter
only
as
attraction
and
attraction
and
repulsion
matter
being
no
conceivable
case
in
which
we
may
not
employ
the
term
matter
and
the
terms
attraction
and
repulsion
taken
together
as
equivalent
and
therefore
convertible
expressions
in
logic
i
said
just
now
that
what
i
have
described
as
the
tendency
of
the
diffused
atoms
to
return
into
their
original
unity
would
be
understood
as
the
principle
of
the
newtonian
law
of
gravity
and
in
fact
there
can
be
little
difficulty
in
such
an
understanding
if
we
look
at
the
newtonian
gravity
in
a
merely
general
view
as
a
force
impelling
matter
to
seek
matter
that
is
to
say
when
we
pay
no
attention
to
the
known
of
the
newtonian
force
the
general
coincidence
satisfies
us
but
upon
looking
closely
we
see
in
detail
much
that
appears
and
much
in
regard
to
which
no
coincidence
at
least
is
established
for
example
the
newtonian
gravity
when
we
think
of
it
in
certain
moods
does
seem
to
be
a
tendency
to
at
all
but
rather
a
tendency
of
all
bodies
in
all
phrase
apparently
expressive
of
a
tendency
to
diffusion
here
then
is
an
again
when
we
reflect
on
the
mathematical
governing
the
newtonian
tendency
we
see
clearly
that
no
coincidence
has
been
made
good
in
respect
of
the
at
least
between
gravitation
as
known
to
exist
and
that
seemingly
simple
and
direct
tendency
which
i
have
assumed
in
fact
i
have
attained
a
point
at
which
it
will
be
advisable
to
strengthen
my
position
by
reversing
my
processes
so
far
we
have
gone
on
from
an
abstract
consideration
of
as
that
quality
most
likely
to
have
characterized
the
original
action
of
god
let
us
now
see
whether
the
established
facts
of
the
newtonian
gravitation
may
not
afford
us
some
legitimate
inductions
what
does
the
newtonian
law
declare
all
bodies
attract
each
other
with
forces
proportional
to
their
quantities
of
matter
and
inversely
proportional
to
the
squares
of
their
distances
purposely
i
have
here
given
in
the
first
place
the
vulgar
version
of
the
law
and
i
confess
that
in
this
as
in
most
other
vulgar
versions
of
great
truths
we
find
little
of
a
suggestive
character
let
us
now
adopt
a
more
philosophical
phraseology
atom
of
every
body
attracts
every
other
atom
both
of
its
own
and
of
every
other
body
with
a
force
which
varies
inversely
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
between
the
attracting
and
attracted
indeed
a
flood
of
suggestion
bursts
upon
the
mind
but
let
us
see
distinctly
what
it
was
that
newton
to
the
grossly
irrational
definitions
of
prescribed
by
the
metaphysical
schools
he
was
forced
to
content
himself
with
showing
how
thoroughly
the
motions
of
an
imaginary
universe
composed
of
attracting
and
attracted
atoms
obedient
to
the
law
he
announced
coincide
with
those
of
the
actually
existing
universe
so
far
as
it
comes
under
our
observation
this
was
the
amount
of
his
is
to
say
this
was
the
amount
of
it
according
to
the
conventional
cant
of
the
his
successes
added
proof
multiplied
by
proof
as
a
sound
intellect
the
of
the
law
itself
persist
the
metaphysicians
had
not
been
strengthened
in
any
degree
proof
however
of
attraction
here
upon
earth
in
accordance
with
the
newtonian
theory
was
at
length
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
some
intellectual
grovellers
afforded
this
proof
arose
collaterally
and
incidentally
as
nearly
all
important
truths
have
arisen
out
of
an
attempt
to
ascertain
the
mean
density
of
the
earth
in
the
famous
maskelyne
cavendish
and
bailly
experiments
for
this
purpose
the
attraction
of
the
mass
of
a
mountain
was
seen
felt
measured
and
found
to
be
mathematically
consistent
with
the
immortal
theory
of
the
british
astronomer
but
in
spite
of
this
confirmation
of
that
which
needed
spite
of
the
corroboration
of
the
theory
by
the
ocular
and
physical
proof
spite
of
the
of
this
ideas
which
even
really
philosophical
men
can
not
help
imbibing
of
especially
the
ideas
of
it
which
ordinary
men
get
and
contentedly
maintain
are
to
have
been
derived
for
the
most
part
from
a
consideration
of
the
principle
as
they
find
it
in
the
planet
upon
which
they
now
to
what
does
so
partial
a
consideration
what
species
of
error
does
it
give
rise
on
the
earth
we
and
only
that
gravity
impels
all
bodies
towards
the
of
the
earth
no
man
in
the
common
walks
of
life
could
be
to
see
or
to
feel
anything
be
made
to
perceive
that
anything
anywhere
has
a
perpetual
gravitating
tendency
in
any
direction
than
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
yet
with
an
exception
hereafter
to
be
specified
it
is
a
fact
that
every
earthly
thing
not
to
speak
now
of
every
heavenly
thing
has
a
tendency
not
to
the
earth
s
centre
but
in
every
conceivable
direction
besides
now
although
the
philosophic
can
not
be
said
to
the
vulgar
in
this
matter
they
nevertheless
permit
themselves
to
be
influenced
without
knowing
it
by
the
of
the
vulgar
idea
although
the
pagan
fables
are
not
believed
says
bryant
in
his
very
erudite
mythology
yet
we
forget
ourselves
continually
and
make
inferences
from
them
as
from
existing
i
mean
to
assert
that
the
merely
of
gravity
as
we
experience
it
on
earth
beguiles
mankind
into
the
fancy
of
or
respecting
been
continually
biasing
towards
this
fancy
even
the
mightiest
although
imperceptibly
leading
them
away
from
the
real
characteristics
of
the
principle
thus
preventing
them
up
to
this
date
from
ever
getting
a
glimpse
of
that
vital
truth
which
lies
in
a
diametrically
opposite
the
principle
s
of
concentralization
or
of
and
this
vital
truth
is
as
the
of
the
phænomenon
let
me
now
repeat
the
definition
of
gravity
atom
of
every
body
attracts
every
other
atom
both
of
its
own
and
of
every
other
with
a
force
which
varies
inversely
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
of
the
attracting
and
attracted
atom
here
let
the
reader
pause
with
me
for
a
moment
in
contemplation
of
the
the
the
altogether
unimaginable
complexity
of
relation
involved
in
the
fact
that
atom
attracts
every
other
merely
in
this
fact
of
the
attraction
without
reference
to
the
law
or
mode
in
which
the
attraction
is
in
the
fact
that
each
atom
attracts
every
other
atom
in
a
wilderness
of
atoms
so
numerous
that
those
which
go
to
the
composition
of
a
exceed
probably
in
mere
point
of
number
all
the
stars
which
go
to
the
constitution
of
the
universe
had
we
discovered
simply
that
each
atom
tended
to
some
one
favorite
some
especially
attractive
should
still
have
fallen
upon
a
discovery
which
in
itself
would
have
sufficed
to
overwhelm
the
mind
what
is
it
that
we
are
actually
called
upon
to
comprehend
that
each
atom
with
the
most
delicate
movements
of
every
other
atom
and
with
each
and
with
all
at
the
same
time
and
forever
and
according
to
a
determinate
law
of
which
the
complexity
even
considered
by
itself
solely
is
utterly
beyond
the
grasp
of
the
imagination
of
man
if
i
propose
to
ascertain
the
influence
of
one
mote
in
a
sunbeam
upon
its
neighboring
mote
i
can
not
accomplish
my
purpose
without
first
counting
and
weighing
all
the
atoms
in
the
universe
and
defining
the
precise
positions
of
all
at
one
particular
moment
if
i
venture
to
displace
by
even
the
billionth
part
of
an
inch
the
microscopical
speck
of
dust
which
lies
now
upon
the
point
of
my
finger
what
is
the
character
of
that
act
upon
which
i
have
adventured
i
have
done
a
deed
which
shakes
the
moon
in
her
path
which
causes
the
sun
to
be
no
longer
the
sun
and
which
alters
forever
the
destiny
of
the
multitudinous
myriads
of
stars
that
roll
and
glow
in
the
majestic
presence
of
their
creator
such
as
rather
than
conclusions
or
even
considerations
of
the
intellect
i
repeat
such
as
these
are
such
as
we
can
alone
hope
profitably
to
entertain
in
any
effort
at
grasping
the
great
principle
but
now
such
such
a
of
the
marvellous
complexity
of
attraction
fairly
in
his
any
person
competent
of
thought
on
such
topics
as
these
set
himself
to
the
task
of
imagining
a
for
the
phænomena
condition
from
which
they
sprang
does
not
so
evident
a
brotherhood
among
the
atoms
point
to
a
common
parentage
does
not
a
sympathy
so
omniprevalent
so
ineradicable
and
so
thoroughly
irrespective
suggest
a
common
paternity
as
its
source
does
not
one
extreme
impel
the
reason
to
the
other
does
not
the
infinitude
of
division
refer
to
the
utterness
of
individuality
does
not
the
entireness
of
the
complex
hint
at
the
perfection
of
the
simple
it
is
that
the
atoms
as
we
see
them
are
divided
or
that
they
are
complex
in
their
that
they
are
inconceivably
divided
and
unutterably
complex
is
the
extremeness
of
the
conditions
to
which
i
now
allude
rather
than
to
the
conditions
themselves
in
a
word
is
it
not
because
the
atoms
were
at
some
remote
epoch
of
time
even
than
it
not
because
originally
and
therefore
normally
they
were
now
in
all
all
all
all
modes
of
all
relations
and
through
all
struggle
to
this
absolutely
this
irrelatively
this
unconditionally
some
person
may
here
demand
it
is
to
the
that
the
atoms
struggle
we
not
find
and
define
attraction
a
merely
general
tendency
to
a
centre
in
especial
do
not
atoms
which
you
describe
as
having
been
irradiated
from
a
at
once
rectilinearly
back
to
the
central
point
of
their
origin
i
reply
that
as
will
be
distinctly
shown
but
that
the
cause
of
their
so
doing
is
quite
irrespective
of
the
centre
they
all
tend
rectilinearly
towards
a
centre
because
of
the
sphereicity
with
which
they
have
been
irradiated
into
space
each
atom
forming
one
of
a
generally
uniform
globe
of
atoms
finds
more
atoms
in
the
direction
of
the
centre
of
course
than
in
any
other
and
in
that
direction
therefore
is
is
thus
impelled
because
the
centre
is
point
of
its
it
is
not
to
any
that
the
atoms
are
allied
it
is
not
any
either
in
the
concrete
or
in
the
abstract
to
which
i
suppose
them
bound
nothing
like
was
conceived
as
their
origin
their
source
lies
in
the
principle
is
their
lost
parent
they
seek
all
it
is
even
partially
to
be
found
thus
appeasing
in
some
measure
the
ineradicable
tendency
while
on
the
way
to
its
absolute
satisfaction
in
the
end
it
follows
from
all
this
that
any
principle
which
shall
be
adequate
to
account
for
the
or
of
the
attractive
force
in
general
will
account
for
this
law
in
particular
is
to
say
any
principle
which
will
show
why
the
atoms
should
tend
to
their
centre
of
with
forces
inversely
proportional
to
the
squares
of
the
distances
will
be
admitted
as
satisfactorily
accounting
at
the
same
time
for
the
tendency
according
to
the
same
law
of
these
atoms
each
to
each
the
tendency
to
the
centre
merely
the
tendency
each
to
each
and
not
any
tendency
to
a
centre
as
it
will
be
seen
also
that
the
establishment
of
my
propositions
would
involve
no
of
modification
in
the
terms
of
the
newtonian
definition
of
gravity
which
declares
that
each
atom
attracts
each
other
atom
and
so
forth
and
declares
this
merely
but
always
under
the
supposition
that
what
i
propose
be
in
the
end
admitted
it
seems
clear
that
some
error
might
occasionally
be
avoided
in
the
future
processes
of
science
were
a
more
ample
phraseology
adopted
instance
each
atom
tends
to
every
other
atom
with
a
force
general
result
being
a
tendency
of
all
with
a
similar
force
to
a
general
the
reversal
of
our
processes
has
thus
brought
us
to
an
identical
result
but
while
in
the
one
process
was
the
in
the
other
it
was
the
goal
in
commencing
the
former
journey
i
could
only
say
that
with
an
irresistible
intuition
i
simplicity
to
have
been
the
characteristic
of
the
original
action
of
god
ending
the
latter
i
can
only
declare
that
with
an
irresistible
intuition
i
perceive
unity
to
have
been
the
source
of
the
observed
phænomena
of
the
newtonian
gravitation
thus
according
to
the
schools
i
nothing
so
be
it
design
but
to
to
through
the
suggestion
i
am
proudly
aware
that
there
exist
many
of
the
most
profound
and
cautiously
discriminative
human
intellects
which
can
not
being
abundantly
content
with
to
these
to
my
is
no
mathematical
demonstration
which
bring
the
least
additional
of
the
great
which
i
have
truth
of
original
unity
as
the
the
principle
of
the
universal
for
my
part
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
speak
and
am
not
so
sure
that
my
heart
beats
and
that
my
soul
lives
the
rising
of
s
probability
that
as
yet
lies
in
the
do
not
pretend
to
be
one
thousandth
part
as
i
am
of
the
irretrievably
that
all
things
and
all
thoughts
of
things
with
all
their
ineffable
multiplicity
of
relation
sprang
at
once
into
being
from
the
primordial
and
irrelative
referring
to
the
newtonian
gravity
nichol
the
eloquent
author
of
the
architecture
of
the
heavens
says
in
truth
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
this
great
law
as
now
revealed
to
be
the
ultimate
or
simplest
and
therefore
the
universal
and
form
of
a
great
ordinance
the
mode
in
which
its
intensity
diminishes
with
the
element
of
distance
has
not
the
aspect
of
an
ultimate
which
always
assumes
the
simplicity
and
of
those
axioms
which
constitute
the
basis
of
now
it
is
quite
true
that
ultimate
principles
in
the
common
understanding
of
the
words
always
assume
the
simplicity
of
geometrical
as
for
there
is
no
such
thing
these
principles
are
clearly
ultimate
in
other
terms
what
we
are
in
the
habit
of
calling
principles
are
no
principles
properly
there
can
be
but
one
the
volition
of
god
we
have
no
right
to
assume
then
from
what
we
observe
in
rules
that
we
choose
foolishly
to
name
principles
anything
at
all
in
respect
to
the
characteristics
of
a
principle
proper
the
ultimate
principles
of
which
nichol
speaks
as
having
geometrical
simplicity
may
and
do
have
this
geometrical
turn
as
being
part
and
parcel
of
a
vast
geometrical
system
and
thus
a
system
of
simplicity
which
nevertheless
the
ultimate
principle
is
we
the
consummation
of
the
is
to
say
of
the
is
it
not
the
spiritual
capacity
of
god
i
quoted
nichol
s
remark
however
not
so
much
to
question
its
philosophy
as
by
way
of
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
while
all
men
have
admitted
principle
as
existing
behind
the
law
of
gravity
no
attempt
has
been
yet
made
to
point
out
what
this
principle
in
particular
we
except
perhaps
occasional
fantastic
efforts
at
referring
it
to
magnetism
or
mesmerism
or
swedenborgianism
or
transcendentalism
or
some
other
equally
delicious
of
the
same
species
and
invariably
patronized
by
one
and
the
same
species
of
people
the
great
mind
of
newton
while
boldly
grasping
the
law
itself
shrank
from
the
principle
of
the
law
the
more
fluent
and
comprehensive
at
least
if
not
the
more
patient
and
profound
sagacity
of
laplace
had
not
the
courage
to
attack
it
but
hesitation
on
the
part
of
these
two
astronomers
it
is
perhaps
not
so
very
difficult
to
understand
they
as
well
as
all
the
first
class
of
mathematicians
were
mathematicians
intellect
at
least
had
a
tone
what
lay
not
distinctly
within
the
domain
of
physics
or
of
mathematics
seemed
to
them
either
or
shadow
nevertheless
we
may
well
wonder
that
leibnitz
who
was
a
marked
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
these
respects
and
whose
mental
temperament
was
a
singular
admixture
of
the
mathematical
with
the
did
not
at
once
investigate
and
establish
the
point
at
issue
either
newton
or
laplace
seeking
a
principle
and
discovering
none
would
have
rested
contentedly
in
the
conclusion
that
there
was
absolutely
none
but
it
is
almost
impossible
to
fancy
of
leibnitz
that
having
exhausted
in
his
search
the
physical
dominions
he
would
not
have
stepped
at
once
boldly
and
hopefully
amid
his
old
familiar
haunts
in
the
kingdom
of
metaphysics
here
indeed
it
is
clear
that
he
have
adventured
in
search
of
the
treasure
he
did
not
find
it
after
all
was
perhaps
because
his
fairy
guide
imagination
was
not
sufficiently
or
to
direct
him
aright
i
observed
just
now
that
in
fact
there
had
been
certain
vague
attempts
at
referring
gravity
to
some
very
uncertain
these
attempts
however
although
considered
bold
and
justly
so
considered
looked
no
farther
than
to
the
merest
the
newtonian
law
its
has
never
to
my
knowledge
been
approached
in
the
way
of
an
effort
at
explanation
it
is
therefore
with
no
unwarranted
fear
of
being
taken
for
a
madman
at
the
outset
and
before
i
can
bring
my
propositions
fairly
to
the
eye
of
those
who
alone
are
competent
to
decide
upon
them
that
i
here
declare
the
of
the
law
of
gravity
to
be
an
exceedingly
simple
and
perfectly
explicable
is
to
say
when
we
make
our
advances
towards
it
in
just
gradations
and
in
the
true
we
regard
it
from
the
proper
point
of
view
whether
we
reach
the
idea
of
absolute
as
the
source
of
all
things
from
a
consideration
of
simplicity
as
the
most
probable
characteristic
of
the
original
action
of
god
we
arrive
at
it
from
an
inspection
of
the
universality
of
relation
in
the
gravitating
phænomena
whether
we
attain
it
as
a
result
of
the
mutual
corroboration
afforded
by
both
processes
the
idea
itself
if
entertained
at
all
is
entertained
in
inseparable
connection
with
another
of
the
condition
of
the
universe
of
stars
as
we
perceive
is
to
say
a
condition
of
immeasurable
through
space
now
a
connection
between
these
two
and
can
not
be
established
unless
through
the
entertainment
of
a
third
of
absolute
unity
being
taken
as
a
centre
then
the
existing
universe
of
stars
is
the
result
of
from
that
centre
now
the
laws
of
irradiation
are
they
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
they
belong
to
the
class
of
geometrical
we
say
of
them
they
are
are
to
demand
they
are
true
would
be
to
demand
why
the
axioms
are
true
upon
which
their
demonstration
is
based
is
demonstrable
strictly
speaking
but
anything
then
the
laws
in
question
are
demonstrated
but
these
do
they
declare
what
steps
does
it
proceed
outwardly
from
a
centre
from
a
centre
issues
by
irradiation
and
the
quantities
of
light
received
upon
any
given
plane
supposed
to
be
shifting
its
position
so
as
to
be
now
nearer
the
centre
and
now
farther
from
it
will
be
diminished
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
of
the
plane
from
the
luminous
body
are
increased
and
will
be
increased
in
the
same
proportion
as
these
squares
are
diminished
the
expression
of
the
law
may
be
thus
generalized
number
of
or
if
the
phrase
be
preferred
the
number
of
received
upon
the
shifting
plane
will
be
proportional
with
the
squares
of
the
distances
of
the
plane
generalizing
yet
again
we
may
say
that
the
irradiation
in
a
proportional
with
the
squares
of
the
distances
illustration
for
example
at
the
distance
b
from
the
luminous
centre
a
a
certain
number
of
particles
are
so
diffused
as
to
occupy
the
surface
b
then
at
double
the
is
to
say
at
will
be
so
much
farther
diffused
as
to
occupy
four
such
surfaces
treble
the
distance
or
at
d
they
will
be
so
much
farther
separated
as
to
occupy
nine
such
surfaces
at
quadruple
the
distance
or
at
e
they
will
have
become
so
scattered
as
to
spread
themselves
over
sixteen
such
so
on
forever
in
saying
generally
that
the
irradiation
proceeds
in
direct
proportion
with
the
squares
of
the
distances
we
use
the
term
irradiation
to
express
degree
of
the
as
we
proceed
outwardly
from
the
centre
conversing
the
idea
and
employing
the
word
concentralization
to
express
degree
of
the
drawing
as
we
come
back
toward
the
centre
from
an
outward
position
we
may
say
that
concentralization
proceeds
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
in
other
words
we
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
on
the
hypothesis
that
matter
was
originally
irradiated
from
a
centre
and
is
now
returning
to
it
the
concentralization
in
the
return
proceeds
as
we
know
the
force
of
gravitation
to
now
here
if
we
could
be
permitted
to
assume
that
concentralization
exactly
represented
the
of
the
tendency
to
the
the
one
was
exactly
proportional
to
the
other
and
that
the
two
proceeded
should
have
shown
all
that
is
required
the
sole
difficulty
existing
then
is
to
establish
a
direct
proportion
between
concentralization
and
the
of
concentralization
and
this
is
done
of
course
if
we
establish
such
proportion
between
irradiation
and
the
of
irradiation
a
very
slight
inspection
of
the
heavens
assures
us
that
the
stars
have
a
certain
general
uniformity
equability
or
equidistance
of
distribution
through
that
region
of
space
in
which
collectively
and
in
a
roughly
globular
form
they
are
situated
species
of
very
general
rather
than
absolute
equability
being
in
full
keeping
with
my
deduction
of
inequidistance
within
certain
limits
among
the
originally
diffused
atoms
as
a
corollary
from
the
evident
design
of
infinite
complexity
of
relation
out
of
irrelation
i
started
it
will
be
remembered
with
the
idea
of
a
generally
uniform
but
particularly
distribution
of
the
atoms
idea
i
repeat
which
an
inspection
of
the
stars
as
they
exist
confirms
but
even
in
the
merely
general
equability
of
distribution
as
regards
the
atoms
there
appears
a
difficulty
which
no
doubt
has
already
suggested
itself
to
those
among
my
readers
who
have
borne
in
mind
that
i
suppose
this
equability
of
distribution
effected
through
from
a
the
very
first
glance
at
the
idea
irradiation
forces
us
to
the
entertainment
of
the
hitherto
unseparated
and
seemingly
inseparable
idea
of
agglomeration
about
a
centre
with
dispersion
as
we
recede
from
idea
in
a
word
of
of
distribution
in
respect
to
the
matter
irradiated
now
i
have
elsewhere
observed
that
it
is
by
just
such
difficulties
as
the
one
now
in
protuberances
above
the
plane
of
the
reason
feels
her
way
if
at
all
in
her
search
for
the
true
by
the
peculiarity
presented
i
leap
at
once
to
secret
which
i
might
never
have
attained
for
the
peculiarity
and
the
inferences
which
its
mere
character
of
it
affords
me
in
the
rue
the
process
of
thought
at
this
point
may
be
thus
roughly
sketched
say
to
unity
as
i
have
explained
it
is
a
feel
it
diffusion
is
a
see
it
irradiation
by
which
alone
these
two
truths
are
reconciled
is
a
consequent
perceive
it
of
diffusion
first
deduced
and
then
corroborated
by
the
inspection
of
phænomena
is
also
a
fully
admit
it
so
far
all
is
clear
around
me
are
no
clouds
behind
which
great
secret
of
the
gravitating
possibly
lie
hidden
this
secret
lies
most
assuredly
and
there
but
a
cloud
in
view
i
should
be
driven
to
suspicion
of
that
and
now
just
as
i
say
this
there
actually
comes
a
cloud
into
view
this
cloud
is
the
seeming
impossibility
of
reconciling
my
truth
with
my
truth
of
i
say
now
behind
this
impossibility
is
to
be
found
what
i
i
do
not
say
impossibility
for
invincible
faith
in
my
truths
assures
me
that
it
is
a
mere
difficulty
after
i
go
on
to
say
with
unflinching
confidence
that
this
shall
be
solved
we
shall
find
up
in
the
process
of
the
key
to
the
secret
at
which
we
aim
that
we
shall
discover
possible
solution
of
the
difficulty
this
for
the
reason
that
were
there
two
one
would
be
be
be
contain
no
no
duplicate
key
can
be
needed
to
any
secret
of
nature
and
now
let
us
see
usual
notions
of
fact
our
distinct
notions
of
caught
merely
from
the
process
as
we
see
it
exemplified
in
here
there
is
a
outpouring
of
and
a
force
which
we
have
at
least
no
right
to
suppose
varies
at
now
in
any
such
irradiation
and
of
unvarying
regions
nearer
the
centre
must
be
always
more
crowded
with
the
irradiated
matter
than
the
regions
more
remote
but
i
have
assumed
such
irradiation
i
assumed
no
irradiation
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
such
an
assumption
would
have
involved
first
the
necessity
of
entertaining
a
conception
which
i
have
shown
no
man
entertain
and
which
as
i
will
more
fully
explain
hereafter
all
observation
of
the
firmament
conception
of
the
absolute
infinity
of
the
universe
of
would
have
involved
secondly
the
impossibility
of
understanding
a
is
existing
while
an
act
is
continued
no
rëaction
of
course
can
take
place
my
assumption
then
or
rather
my
inevitable
deduction
from
just
that
of
a
finally
let
me
now
describe
the
sole
possible
mode
in
which
it
is
conceivable
that
matter
could
have
been
diffused
through
space
so
as
to
fulfil
the
conditions
at
once
of
irradiation
and
of
generally
equable
distribution
for
convenience
of
illustration
let
us
imagine
in
the
first
place
a
hollow
sphere
of
glass
or
of
anything
else
occupying
the
space
throughout
which
the
universal
matter
is
to
be
thus
equally
diffused
by
means
of
irradiation
from
the
absolute
irrelative
unconditional
particle
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
sphere
now
a
certain
exertion
of
the
diffusive
power
presumed
to
be
the
divine
volition
other
words
a
certain
measure
is
the
quantity
of
is
to
say
the
number
of
emits
by
irradiation
this
certain
number
of
atoms
forcing
them
in
all
directions
outwardly
from
the
proximity
to
each
other
diminishing
as
they
finally
they
are
distributed
loosely
over
the
interior
surface
of
the
sphere
when
these
atoms
have
attained
this
position
or
while
proceeding
to
attain
it
a
second
and
inferior
exercise
of
the
same
a
second
and
inferior
force
of
the
same
in
the
same
is
to
say
by
irradiation
as
second
stratum
of
atoms
which
proceeds
to
deposit
itself
upon
the
first
the
number
of
atoms
in
this
case
as
in
the
former
being
of
course
the
measure
of
the
force
which
emitted
them
in
other
words
the
force
being
precisely
adapted
to
the
purpose
it
force
and
the
number
of
atoms
sent
out
by
the
force
being
when
this
second
stratum
has
reached
its
destined
while
approaching
third
still
inferior
exertion
of
the
force
or
a
third
inferior
force
of
a
similar
number
of
atoms
emitted
being
in
cases
the
measure
of
the
to
deposit
a
third
stratum
upon
the
second
so
on
until
these
concentric
strata
growing
gradually
less
and
less
come
down
at
length
to
the
central
point
and
the
diffusive
matter
simultaneously
with
the
diffusive
force
is
exhausted
we
have
now
the
sphere
filled
through
means
of
irradiation
with
atoms
equably
diffused
the
two
necessary
of
irradiation
and
of
equable
satisfied
and
by
the
process
in
which
the
possibility
of
their
simultaneous
satisfaction
is
conceivable
for
this
reason
i
confidently
expect
to
find
lurking
in
the
present
condition
of
the
atoms
as
distributed
throughout
the
sphere
the
secret
of
which
i
am
in
principle
of
the
of
the
newtonian
law
let
us
examine
then
the
actual
condition
of
the
atoms
they
lie
in
a
series
of
concentric
strata
they
are
equably
diffused
throughout
the
sphere
they
have
been
irradiated
into
these
states
the
atoms
being
distributed
the
greater
the
superficial
extent
of
any
of
these
concentric
strata
or
spheres
the
more
atoms
will
lie
upon
it
in
other
words
the
number
of
atoms
lying
upon
the
surface
of
any
one
of
the
concentric
spheres
is
directly
proportional
with
the
extent
of
that
surface
in
any
series
of
concentric
spheres
the
surfaces
are
directly
proportional
with
the
squares
of
the
distances
from
the
surfaces
of
spheres
are
as
the
squares
of
their
radii
therefore
the
number
of
atoms
in
any
stratum
is
directly
proportional
with
the
square
of
that
stratum
s
distance
from
the
centre
but
the
number
of
atoms
in
any
stratum
is
the
measure
of
the
force
which
emitted
that
is
to
say
is
with
the
force
therefore
the
force
which
irradiated
any
stratum
is
directly
proportional
with
the
square
of
that
stratum
s
distance
from
the
centre
generally
force
of
the
irradiation
has
been
directly
proportional
with
the
squares
of
the
now
rëaction
as
far
as
we
know
anything
of
it
is
action
conversed
the
principle
of
gravity
being
in
the
first
place
understood
as
the
rëaction
of
an
the
expression
of
a
desire
on
the
part
of
matter
while
existing
in
a
state
of
diffusion
to
return
into
the
unity
whence
it
was
diffused
and
in
the
second
place
the
mind
being
called
upon
to
determine
the
of
the
manner
in
which
it
would
naturally
be
manifested
in
other
words
being
called
upon
to
conceive
a
probable
law
or
for
the
return
could
not
well
help
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
this
law
of
return
would
be
precisely
the
converse
of
the
law
of
departure
that
such
would
be
the
case
any
one
at
least
would
be
abundantly
justified
in
taking
for
granted
until
such
time
as
some
person
should
suggest
something
like
a
plausible
reason
why
it
should
be
the
such
period
as
a
law
of
return
shall
be
imagined
which
the
intellect
can
consider
as
preferable
matter
then
irradiated
into
space
with
a
force
varying
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
might
be
supposed
to
return
towards
its
centre
of
irradiation
with
a
force
varying
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
and
i
have
already
shown
that
any
principle
which
will
explain
why
the
atoms
should
tend
according
to
any
law
to
the
general
centre
must
be
admitted
as
satisfactorily
explaining
at
the
same
time
why
according
to
the
same
law
they
should
tend
each
to
each
for
in
fact
the
tendency
to
the
general
centre
is
not
to
a
centre
as
such
but
because
of
its
being
a
point
in
tending
towards
which
each
atom
tends
most
directly
to
its
real
and
essential
centre
absolute
and
final
union
of
all
page
the
consideration
here
involved
presents
to
my
own
mind
no
embarrassment
this
fact
does
not
blind
me
to
the
possibility
of
its
being
obscure
to
those
who
may
have
been
less
in
the
habit
of
dealing
with
abstractions
upon
the
whole
it
may
be
as
well
to
look
at
the
matter
from
one
or
two
other
points
of
view
the
absolute
irrelative
particle
primarily
created
by
the
volition
of
god
must
have
been
in
a
condition
of
positive
or
wrongfulness
implies
right
is
positive
wrong
is
merely
the
negation
of
right
as
cold
is
the
negation
of
of
light
that
a
thing
may
be
wrong
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
some
other
thing
in
to
which
it
condition
which
it
fails
to
satisfy
some
law
which
it
violates
some
being
whom
it
aggrieves
if
there
be
no
such
being
law
or
condition
in
respect
to
which
the
thing
is
still
more
especially
if
no
beings
laws
or
conditions
exist
at
the
thing
be
wrong
and
consequently
must
be
any
deviation
from
normality
involves
a
tendency
to
return
into
it
a
difference
from
the
the
the
be
understood
as
effected
only
by
the
overcoming
a
difficulty
and
if
the
force
which
overcomes
the
difficulty
be
not
infinitely
continued
the
ineradicable
tendency
to
return
will
at
length
be
permitted
to
act
for
its
own
satisfaction
upon
withdrawal
of
the
force
the
tendency
acts
this
is
the
principle
of
rëaction
as
the
inevitable
consequence
of
finite
action
employing
a
phraseology
of
which
the
seeming
affectation
will
be
pardoned
for
its
expressiveness
we
may
say
that
rëaction
is
the
return
from
the
condition
of
it
is
and
ought
not
to
into
the
condition
of
it
was
originally
and
therefore
ought
to
let
me
add
here
that
the
force
of
rëaction
would
no
doubt
be
always
found
in
direct
proportion
with
the
the
ever
it
were
possible
to
measure
this
latter
consequently
the
greatest
of
all
conceivable
reactions
must
be
that
produced
by
the
tendency
which
we
now
tendency
to
return
into
the
the
primitive
gravity
then
be
the
strongest
of
idea
reached
and
abundantly
confirmed
by
induction
what
use
i
make
of
the
idea
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
the
atoms
now
having
been
diffused
from
their
normal
condition
of
unity
seek
to
return
not
to
any
particular
certainly
for
it
is
clear
that
if
upon
the
diffusion
the
whole
universe
of
matter
had
been
projected
collectively
to
a
distance
from
the
point
of
irradiation
the
atomic
tendency
to
the
general
centre
of
the
sphere
would
not
have
been
disturbed
in
the
least
atoms
would
not
have
sought
the
point
absolute
from
which
they
were
originally
impelled
it
is
merely
the
and
not
the
point
or
locality
at
which
this
condition
took
its
rise
that
these
atoms
seek
to
is
merely
condition
which
is
their
that
they
desire
but
they
seek
a
centre
it
will
be
said
and
a
centre
is
a
true
but
they
seek
this
point
not
in
its
character
of
for
were
the
whole
sphere
moved
from
its
position
they
would
seek
equally
the
centre
and
the
centre
would
be
a
point
because
it
so
happens
on
account
of
the
form
in
which
they
collectively
that
of
the
sphere
only
the
point
in
sphere
s
can
attain
their
true
object
unity
in
the
direction
of
the
centre
each
atom
perceives
more
atoms
than
in
any
other
direction
each
atom
is
impelled
towards
the
centre
because
along
the
straight
line
joining
it
and
the
centre
and
passing
on
to
the
circumference
beyond
there
lie
a
greater
number
of
atoms
than
along
any
other
straight
greater
number
of
objects
that
seek
it
the
individual
greater
number
of
tendencies
to
greater
number
of
satisfactions
for
its
own
tendency
to
a
word
because
in
the
direction
of
the
centre
lies
the
utmost
possibility
of
satisfaction
generally
for
its
own
individual
appetite
to
be
brief
the
unity
is
all
that
is
really
sought
and
if
the
atoms
to
seek
the
centre
of
the
sphere
it
is
only
impliedly
through
such
centre
happens
to
imply
to
include
or
to
involve
the
only
essential
centre
unity
but
account
this
implication
or
involution
there
is
no
possibility
of
practically
separating
the
tendency
to
unity
in
the
abstract
from
the
tendency
to
the
concrete
centre
thus
the
tendency
of
the
atoms
to
the
general
centre
to
all
practical
intents
and
for
all
logical
purposes
the
tendency
each
to
each
and
the
tendency
each
to
each
the
tendency
to
the
centre
and
the
one
tendency
may
be
assumed
the
other
whatever
will
apply
to
the
one
must
be
thoroughly
applicable
to
the
other
and
in
conclusion
whatever
principle
will
satisfactorily
explain
the
one
can
not
be
questioned
as
an
explanation
of
the
other
in
looking
carefully
around
me
for
rational
objection
to
what
i
have
advanced
i
am
able
to
discover
of
that
class
of
objections
usually
urged
by
the
doubters
for
doubt
s
sake
i
very
readily
perceive
and
proceed
to
dispose
of
them
in
order
it
may
be
said
first
the
proof
that
the
force
of
irradiation
in
the
case
described
is
directly
proportional
to
the
squares
of
the
distances
depends
upon
an
unwarranted
of
the
number
of
atoms
in
each
stratum
being
the
measure
of
the
force
with
which
they
are
i
reply
not
only
that
i
am
warranted
in
such
assumption
but
that
i
should
be
utterly
in
any
other
what
i
assume
is
simply
that
an
effect
is
the
measure
of
its
every
exercise
of
the
divine
will
will
be
proportional
to
that
which
demands
the
the
means
of
omnipotence
or
of
omniscience
will
be
exactly
adapted
to
its
purposes
neither
can
a
deficiency
nor
an
excess
of
cause
bring
to
pass
any
effect
had
the
force
which
irradiated
any
stratum
to
its
position
been
either
more
or
less
than
was
needed
for
the
is
to
say
not
to
the
to
its
position
that
stratum
could
not
have
been
irradiated
had
the
force
which
with
a
view
to
general
equability
of
distribution
emitted
the
proper
number
of
atoms
for
each
stratum
been
not
to
the
number
then
the
number
would
have
been
the
number
demanded
for
the
equable
distribution
the
second
supposable
objection
is
somewhat
better
entitled
to
an
answer
it
is
an
admitted
principle
in
dynamics
that
every
body
on
receiving
an
impulse
or
disposition
to
move
will
move
onward
in
a
straight
line
in
the
direction
imparted
by
the
impelling
force
until
deflected
or
stopped
by
some
other
force
how
then
it
may
be
asked
is
my
first
or
external
stratum
of
atoms
to
be
understood
as
discontinuing
their
movement
at
the
circumference
of
the
imaginary
glass
sphere
when
no
second
force
of
more
than
an
imaginary
character
appears
to
account
for
the
discontinuance
i
reply
that
the
objection
in
this
case
actually
does
arise
out
of
an
unwarranted
assumption
the
part
of
the
assumption
of
a
principle
in
dynamics
at
an
epoch
when
principles
in
exist
use
the
word
principle
of
course
in
the
objector
s
understanding
of
the
word
in
the
beginning
we
can
we
can
one
truly
ultimate
volition
of
god
the
primary
of
irradiation
from
have
been
independent
of
all
that
which
the
world
now
calls
principle
all
that
we
so
designate
is
but
a
consequence
of
the
rëaction
of
that
primary
act
say
act
for
the
creation
of
the
absolute
material
particle
is
more
properly
to
be
regarded
as
a
than
as
an
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
thus
we
must
regard
the
primary
act
as
an
act
for
the
establishment
of
what
we
now
call
but
this
primary
act
itself
is
to
be
considered
as
the
thought
of
god
is
to
be
understood
as
originating
the
proceeding
with
regulating
finally
as
being
withdrawn
from
it
upon
its
completion
commences
rëaction
and
through
rëaction
principle
as
we
employ
the
word
it
will
be
advisable
however
to
limit
the
application
of
this
word
to
the
two
results
of
the
discontinuance
of
the
divine
is
to
the
two
agents
and
every
other
natural
agent
depends
either
more
or
less
immediately
upon
these
two
and
therefore
would
be
more
conveniently
designated
as
it
may
be
objected
thirdly
that
in
general
the
peculiar
mode
of
distribution
which
i
have
suggested
for
the
atoms
is
an
hypothesis
and
nothing
now
i
am
aware
that
the
word
hypothesis
is
a
ponderous
grasped
immediately
if
not
lifted
by
all
very
diminutive
thinkers
upon
the
first
appearance
of
any
proposition
wearing
in
any
particular
the
garb
of
but
hypothesis
can
not
be
wielded
to
any
good
purpose
even
by
those
who
succeed
in
lifting
men
or
great
i
maintain
first
that
in
the
mode
described
is
it
conceivable
that
matter
could
have
been
diffused
so
as
to
fulfil
at
once
the
conditions
of
irradiation
and
of
generally
equable
distribution
i
maintain
secondly
that
these
conditions
themselves
have
been
imposed
upon
me
as
necessities
in
a
train
of
ratiocination
rigorously
logical
as
that
which
establishes
any
demonstration
in
and
i
maintain
thirdly
that
even
if
the
charge
of
hypothesis
were
as
fully
sustained
as
it
is
in
fact
unsustained
and
untenable
still
the
validity
and
indisputability
of
my
result
would
not
even
in
the
slightest
particular
be
disturbed
to
explain
newtonian
law
of
law
whose
existence
as
such
no
one
out
of
bedlam
law
whose
admission
as
such
enables
us
to
account
for
of
the
universal
law
which
merely
because
it
does
so
enable
us
to
account
for
these
phænomena
we
are
perfectly
willing
without
reference
to
any
other
considerations
to
admit
and
can
not
help
admitting
as
a
law
nevertheless
of
which
neither
the
principle
nor
the
of
the
principle
has
ever
yet
been
traced
by
the
human
law
in
short
which
neither
in
its
detail
nor
in
its
generality
has
been
found
susceptible
of
explanation
at
length
seen
to
be
at
every
point
thoroughly
explicable
provided
only
we
yield
our
assent
to
an
hypothesis
why
an
the
merest
an
hypothesis
for
whose
in
the
case
of
that
hypothesis
the
newtonian
law
shadow
of
reason
could
be
an
hypothesis
even
so
absolute
as
all
this
implies
would
enable
us
to
perceive
a
principle
for
the
newtonian
enable
us
to
understand
as
satisfied
conditions
so
ineffably
complex
and
seemingly
irreconcileable
as
those
involved
in
the
relations
of
which
gravity
tells
us
rational
being
so
expose
his
fatuity
as
to
call
even
this
absolute
hypothesis
an
hypothesis
any
indeed
he
were
to
persist
in
so
calling
it
with
the
understanding
that
he
did
so
simply
for
the
sake
of
consistency
but
what
is
the
true
state
of
our
present
case
what
is
not
only
that
it
is
an
hypothesis
which
we
are
required
in
order
to
admit
the
principle
at
issue
explained
but
that
it
a
logical
conclusion
which
we
are
requested
to
adopt
if
we
can
avoid
we
are
simply
invited
to
if
we
conclusion
of
so
accurate
a
logicality
that
to
dispute
it
would
be
the
doubt
its
validity
beyond
our
power
conclusion
from
which
we
see
no
mode
of
escape
turn
as
we
will
a
result
which
confronts
us
either
at
the
end
of
an
journey
from
the
phænomena
of
the
very
law
discussed
or
at
the
close
of
a
career
from
the
most
rigorously
simple
of
all
conceivable
assumption
in
a
word
of
simplicity
and
if
here
for
the
mere
sake
of
cavilling
it
be
urged
that
although
my
is
as
i
assert
the
assumption
of
absolute
simplicity
yet
simplicity
considered
merely
in
itself
is
no
axiom
and
that
only
deductions
from
axioms
are
is
thus
that
i
reply
every
other
science
than
logic
is
the
science
of
certain
concrete
relations
arithmetic
for
example
is
the
science
of
the
relations
of
of
the
relations
of
in
general
of
the
relations
of
quantity
in
whatever
can
be
increased
or
diminished
logic
however
is
the
science
of
relation
in
the
absolute
relation
considered
solely
in
itself
an
axiom
in
any
particular
science
other
than
logic
is
thus
merely
a
proposition
announcing
certain
concrete
relations
which
seem
to
be
too
obvious
for
when
we
say
for
instance
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
its
part
thus
again
the
principle
of
the
other
words
of
an
axiom
in
the
simply
of
now
it
is
clear
not
only
that
what
is
obvious
to
one
mind
may
not
be
obvious
to
another
but
that
what
is
obvious
to
one
mind
at
one
epoch
may
be
anything
but
obvious
at
another
epoch
to
the
same
mind
it
is
clear
moreover
that
what
is
obvious
even
to
the
majority
of
mankind
or
to
the
majority
of
the
best
intellects
of
mankind
may
be
to
either
majority
more
or
less
obvious
or
in
no
respect
obvious
at
all
it
is
seen
then
that
the
itself
is
susceptible
of
variation
and
of
course
that
axioms
are
susceptible
of
similar
change
being
mutable
the
truths
which
grow
out
of
them
are
necessarily
mutable
too
or
in
other
words
are
never
to
be
positively
depended
upon
as
truths
at
truth
and
immutability
are
one
it
will
now
be
readily
understood
that
no
axiomatic
idea
founded
in
the
fluctuating
principle
obviousness
of
possibly
be
so
reliable
a
basis
for
any
structure
erected
by
the
reason
as
whatever
it
is
wherever
we
can
find
it
or
it
be
practicable
to
find
it
anywhere
is
not
only
presents
to
the
understanding
of
relation
either
greater
or
less
to
be
considered
but
subjects
the
intellect
not
in
the
slightest
degree
to
the
necessity
of
even
looking
at
relation
at
if
such
an
idea
be
not
what
we
too
heedlessly
term
an
axiom
it
is
at
least
preferable
as
a
logical
basis
to
any
axiom
ever
propounded
or
to
all
imaginable
axioms
combined
such
precisely
is
the
idea
with
which
my
deductive
process
so
thoroughly
corroborated
by
induction
commences
my
is
but
to
sum
up
what
has
been
here
advanced
a
starting
point
i
have
taken
it
for
granted
simply
that
the
beginning
had
nothing
behind
it
or
before
it
was
a
beginning
in
it
was
a
beginning
and
nothing
different
from
a
short
that
this
beginning
which
it
if
this
be
a
mere
assumption
then
a
mere
assumption
let
it
be
to
conclude
this
branch
of
the
subject
am
fully
warranted
in
announcing
that
law
which
we
have
been
in
the
habit
of
calling
gravity
exists
on
account
of
matter
s
having
been
irradiated
at
its
origin
atomically
into
a
limited
sphere
of
space
from
one
individual
unconditional
irrelative
and
absolute
particle
proper
by
the
sole
process
in
which
it
was
possible
to
satisfy
at
the
same
time
the
two
conditions
irradiation
and
distribution
throughout
the
is
to
say
by
a
force
varying
in
direct
proportion
with
the
squares
of
the
distances
between
the
irradiated
atoms
respectively
and
the
particular
centre
of
limited
sphere
is
limited
i
prefer
tautology
to
a
chance
of
misconception
i
have
already
given
my
reasons
for
presuming
matter
to
have
been
diffused
by
a
determinate
rather
than
by
a
continuous
or
infinitely
continued
force
supposing
a
continuous
force
we
should
be
unable
in
the
first
place
to
comprehend
a
rëaction
at
all
and
we
should
be
required
in
the
second
place
to
entertain
the
impossible
conception
of
an
infinite
extension
of
matter
not
to
dwell
upon
the
impossibility
of
the
conception
the
infinite
extension
of
matter
is
an
idea
which
if
not
positively
disproved
is
at
least
not
in
any
respect
warranted
by
telescopic
observation
of
the
point
to
be
explained
more
fully
hereafter
and
this
empirical
reason
for
believing
in
the
original
finity
of
matter
is
unempirically
confirmed
for
example
for
the
moment
the
possibility
of
understanding
space
with
the
irradiated
is
to
say
admitting
as
well
as
we
can
for
argument
s
sake
that
the
succession
of
the
irradiated
atoms
had
absolutely
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
even
when
the
volition
of
god
had
been
withdrawn
from
them
and
thus
the
tendency
to
return
into
unity
permitted
abstractly
to
be
satisfied
this
permission
would
have
been
nugatory
and
valueless
and
of
no
effect
whatever
no
rëaction
could
have
taken
place
no
movement
toward
unity
could
have
been
made
no
law
of
gravity
could
have
obtained
to
explain
the
tendency
of
any
one
atom
to
any
one
other
as
the
inevitable
result
of
diffusion
from
the
normal
unity
what
is
the
same
thing
admit
any
given
atom
as
to
move
in
any
given
is
clear
that
since
there
is
an
of
atoms
on
all
sides
of
the
atom
proposing
to
move
it
never
can
actually
move
toward
the
satisfaction
of
its
tendency
in
the
direction
given
on
account
of
a
precisely
equal
and
counterbalancing
tendency
in
the
direction
diametrically
opposite
in
other
words
exactly
as
many
tendencies
to
unity
are
behind
the
hesitating
atom
as
before
it
for
it
is
a
mere
sotticism
to
say
that
one
infinite
line
is
longer
or
shorter
than
another
infinite
line
or
that
one
infinite
number
is
greater
or
less
than
another
number
that
is
infinite
thus
the
atom
in
question
must
remain
stationary
forever
under
the
impossible
circumstances
which
we
have
been
merely
endeavoring
to
conceive
for
argument
s
sake
there
could
have
been
no
aggregation
of
but
a
perpetually
atomic
and
inconsequential
universe
in
fact
view
it
as
we
will
the
whole
idea
of
unlimited
matter
is
not
only
untenable
but
impossible
and
preposterous
with
the
understanding
of
a
of
atoms
however
we
perceive
at
once
a
tendency
to
union
the
general
result
of
the
tendency
each
to
each
being
a
tendency
of
all
to
the
centre
the
process
of
condensation
or
approximation
commences
immediately
by
a
common
and
simultaneous
movement
on
withdrawal
of
the
divine
volition
the
approximations
or
atom
with
atom
being
subject
to
almost
infinite
variations
of
time
degree
and
condition
on
account
of
the
excessive
multiplicity
of
relation
arising
from
the
differences
of
form
assumed
as
characterizing
the
atoms
at
the
moment
of
their
quitting
the
particle
proper
as
well
as
from
the
subsequent
particular
inequidistance
each
from
each
what
i
wish
to
impress
upon
the
reader
is
the
certainty
of
there
arising
at
once
on
withdrawal
of
the
diffusive
force
or
divine
volition
out
of
the
condition
of
the
atoms
as
described
at
innumerable
points
throughout
the
universal
sphere
innumerable
agglomerations
characterized
by
innumerable
specific
differences
of
form
size
essential
nature
and
distance
each
from
each
the
development
of
repulsion
electricity
must
have
commenced
of
course
with
the
very
earliest
particular
efforts
at
unity
and
must
have
proceeded
constantly
in
the
ratio
of
is
to
say
that
of
or
again
of
heterogeneity
thus
the
two
principles
proper
and
material
and
the
each
other
in
the
strictest
fellowship
forever
thus
body
and
the
soul
walk
hand
in
if
now
in
fancy
we
select
of
the
agglomerations
considered
as
in
their
primary
stages
throughout
the
universal
sphere
and
suppose
this
incipient
agglomeration
to
be
taking
place
at
that
point
where
the
centre
of
our
sun
rather
where
it
exist
originally
for
the

perpetually
shifting

find
ourselves

and
borne

least
by
the
most
magnificent
of
the
nebular
cosmogony
of
laplace
cosmogony
is
far
too
comprehensive
a
term
for
what
he
really
is
the
constitution
of
our
solar
system
one
among
the
myriad
of
similar
systems
which
make
up
the
universe
universal
and
absolute
which
forms
the
subject
of
my
present
discourse
confining
himself
to
an
of
our
solar
system
with
its
comparatively
immediate
is
to
say
assuming
without
any
basis
whatever
either
deductive
or
of
what
i
have
been
just
endeavoring
to
place
upon
a
more
stable
basis
than
assumption
assuming
for
example
matter
as
diffused
without
pretending
to
account
for
the
diffusion
throughout
and
somewhat
beyond
the
space
occupied
by
our
in
a
state
of
heterogeneous
nebulosity
and
obedient
to
that
omniprevalent
law
of
gravity
at
whose
principle
he
ventured
to
make
no
guess
all
this
which
is
quite
true
although
he
had
no
logical
right
to
its
assumption
laplace
has
shown
dynamically
and
mathematically
that
the
results
in
such
case
necessarily
ensuing
are
those
and
those
alone
which
we
find
manifested
in
the
actually
existing
condition
of
the
system
itself
to
explain
us
conceive
particular
agglomeration
of
which
we
have
just
one
at
the
point
designated
by
our
sun
s
have
so
far
proceeded
that
a
vast
quantity
of
nebulous
matter
has
here
assumed
a
roughly
globular
form
its
centre
being
of
course
coincident
with
what
is
now
or
rather
was
originally
the
centre
of
our
sun
and
its
periphery
extending
out
beyond
the
orbit
of
neptune
the
most
remote
of
our
planets
other
words
let
us
suppose
the
diameter
of
this
rough
sphere
to
be
some
millions
of
miles
for
ages
this
mass
of
matter
has
been
undergoing
condensation
until
at
length
it
has
become
reduced
into
the
bulk
we
imagine
having
proceeded
gradually
of
course
from
its
atomic
and
imperceptible
state
into
what
we
understand
of
visible
palpable
or
otherwise
appreciable
nebulosity
now
the
condition
of
this
mass
implies
a
rotation
about
an
imaginary
rotation
which
commencing
with
the
absolute
incipiency
of
the
aggregation
has
been
ever
since
acquiring
velocity
the
very
first
two
atoms
which
met
approaching
each
other
from
points
not
diametrically
opposite
would
in
rushing
partially
past
each
other
form
a
nucleus
for
the
rotary
movement
described
how
this
would
increase
in
velocity
is
readily
seen
the
two
atoms
are
joined
by
others
aggregation
is
formed
the
mass
continues
to
rotate
while
condensing
but
any
atom
at
the
circumference
has
of
course
a
more
rapid
motion
than
one
nearer
the
centre
the
outer
atom
however
with
its
superior
velocity
approaches
the
centre
carrying
this
superior
velocity
with
it
as
it
goes
thus
every
atom
proceeding
inwardly
and
finally
attaching
itself
to
the
condensed
centre
adds
something
to
the
original
velocity
of
that
is
to
say
increases
the
rotary
movement
of
the
mass
let
us
now
suppose
this
mass
so
far
condensed
that
it
occupies
the
space
circumscribed
by
the
orbit
of
neptune
and
that
the
velocity
with
which
the
surface
of
the
mass
moves
in
the
general
rotation
is
precisely
that
velocity
with
which
neptune
now
revolves
about
the
sun
at
this
epoch
then
we
are
to
understand
that
the
constantly
increasing
centrifugal
force
having
gotten
the
better
of
the
centripetal
loosened
and
separated
the
exterior
and
least
condensed
stratum
or
a
few
of
the
exterior
and
least
condensed
strata
at
the
equator
of
the
sphere
where
the
tangential
velocity
predominated
so
that
these
strata
formed
about
the
main
body
an
independent
ring
encircling
the
equatorial
regions
as
the
exterior
portion
thrown
off
by
excessive
velocity
of
rotation
from
a
grindstone
would
form
a
ring
about
the
grindstone
but
for
the
solidity
of
the
superficial
material
were
this
caoutchouc
or
anything
similar
in
consistency
precisely
the
phænomenon
i
describe
would
be
presented
the
ring
thus
whirled
from
the
nebulous
mass
of
course
a
separate
ring
with
just
that
velocity
with
which
while
the
surface
of
the
mass
it
in
the
meantime
condensation
still
proceeding
the
interval
between
the
discharged
ring
and
the
main
body
continued
to
increase
until
the
former
was
left
at
a
vast
distance
from
the
latter
now
admitting
the
ring
to
have
possessed
by
some
seemingly
accidental
arrangement
of
its
heterogeneous
materials
a
constitution
nearly
uniform
then
this
ring
such
would
never
have
ceased
revolving
about
its
primary
but
as
might
have
been
anticipated
there
appears
to
have
been
enough
irregularity
in
the
disposition
of
the
materials
to
make
them
cluster
about
centres
of
superior
solidity
and
thus
the
annular
form
was
destroyed
no
doubt
the
band
was
soon
broken
up
into
several
portions
and
one
of
these
portions
predominating
in
mass
absorbed
the
others
into
itself
the
whole
settling
spherically
into
a
planet
that
this
latter
a
planet
continued
the
revolutionary
movement
which
characterized
it
while
a
ring
is
sufficiently
clear
and
that
it
took
upon
itself
also
an
additional
movement
in
its
new
condition
of
sphere
is
readily
explained
the
ring
being
understood
as
yet
unbroken
we
see
that
its
exterior
while
the
whole
revolves
about
the
parent
body
moves
more
rapidly
than
its
interior
when
the
rupture
occurred
then
some
portion
in
each
fragment
must
have
been
moving
with
greater
velocity
than
the
others
the
superior
movement
prevailing
must
have
whirled
each
fragment
is
to
say
have
caused
it
to
rotate
and
the
direction
of
the
rotation
must
of
course
have
been
the
direction
of
the
revolution
whence
it
arose
the
fragments
having
become
subject
to
the
rotation
described
must
in
coalescing
have
imparted
it
to
the
one
planet
constituted
by
their
planet
was
neptune
its
material
continuing
to
undergo
condensation
and
the
centrifugal
force
generated
in
its
rotation
getting
at
length
the
better
of
the
centripetal
as
before
in
the
case
of
the
parent
orb
a
ring
was
whirled
also
from
the
equatorial
surface
of
this
planet
this
ring
having
been
ununiform
in
its
constitution
was
broken
up
and
its
several
fragments
being
absorbed
by
the
most
massive
were
collectively
spherified
into
a
moon
subsequently
the
operation
was
repeated
and
a
second
moon
was
the
result
we
thus
account
for
the
planet
neptune
with
the
two
satellites
which
accompany
him
laplace
assumed
his
nebulosity
heterogeneous
merely
that
he
might
be
thus
enabled
to
account
for
the
breaking
up
of
the
rings
for
had
the
nebulosity
been
homogeneous
they
would
not
have
broken
i
reach
the
same
of
the
secondary
masses
immediately
resulting
from
the
from
an
consideration
of
their
general
in
throwing
off
a
ring
from
its
equator
the
sun
that
equilibrium
between
its
centripetal
and
centrifugal
forces
which
had
been
disturbed
in
the
process
of
condensation
but
as
this
condensation
still
proceeded
the
equilibrium
was
again
immediately
disturbed
through
the
increase
of
rotation
by
the
time
the
mass
had
so
far
shrunk
that
it
occupied
a
spherical
space
just
that
circumscribed
by
the
orbit
of
uranus
we
are
to
understand
that
the
centrifugal
force
had
so
far
obtained
the
ascendency
that
new
relief
was
needed
a
second
equatorial
band
was
consequently
thrown
off
which
proving
ununiform
was
broken
up
as
before
in
the
case
of
neptune
the
fragments
settling
into
the
planet
uranus
the
velocity
of
whose
actual
revolution
about
the
sun
indicates
of
course
the
rotary
speed
of
that
sun
s
equatorial
surface
at
the
moment
of
the
separation
uranus
adopting
a
rotation
from
the
collective
rotations
of
the
fragments
composing
it
as
previously
explained
now
threw
off
ring
after
ring
each
of
which
becoming
broken
up
settled
into
a
moon
moons
at
different
epochs
having
been
formed
in
this
manner
by
the
rupture
and
general
spherification
of
as
many
distinct
ununiform
rings
by
the
time
the
sun
had
shrunk
until
it
occupied
a
space
just
that
circumscribed
by
the
orbit
of
saturn
the
balance
we
are
to
suppose
between
its
centripetal
and
centrifugal
forces
had
again
become
so
far
disturbed
through
increase
of
rotary
velocity
the
result
of
condensation
that
a
third
effort
at
equilibrium
became
necessary
and
an
annular
band
was
therefore
whirled
off
as
twice
before
which
on
rupture
through
ununiformity
became
consolidated
into
the
planet
saturn
this
latter
threw
off
in
the
first
place
seven
uniform
bands
which
on
rupture
were
spherified
respectively
into
as
many
moons
but
subsequently
it
appears
to
have
discharged
at
three
distinct
but
not
very
distant
epochs
three
rings
whose
equability
of
constitution
was
by
apparent
accident
so
considerable
as
to
present
no
occasion
for
their
rupture
thus
they
continue
to
revolve
as
rings
i
use
the
phrase
accident
for
of
accident
in
the
ordinary
sense
there
was
of
course
nothing
term
is
properly
applied
only
to
the
result
of
indistinguishable
or
not
immediately
traceable
shrinking
still
farther
until
it
occupied
just
the
space
circumscribed
by
the
orbit
of
jupiter
the
sun
now
found
need
of
farther
effort
to
restore
the
counterbalance
of
its
two
forces
continually
disarranged
in
the
still
continued
increase
of
rotation
jupiter
accordingly
was
now
thrown
off
passing
from
the
annular
to
the
planetary
condition
and
on
attaining
this
latter
threw
off
in
its
turn
at
four
different
epochs
four
rings
which
finally
resolved
themselves
into
so
many
moons
still
shrinking
until
its
sphere
occupied
just
the
space
defined
by
the
orbit
of
the
asteroids
the
sun
now
discarded
a
ring
which
appears
to
have
had
centres
of
superior
solidity
and
on
breaking
up
to
have
separated
into
eight
fragments
no
one
of
which
so
far
predominated
in
mass
as
to
absorb
the
others
all
therefore
as
distinct
although
comparatively
small
planets
proceeded
to
revolve
in
orbits
whose
distances
each
from
each
may
be
considered
as
in
some
degree
the
measure
of
the
force
which
drove
them
asunder
the
orbits
nevertheless
being
so
closely
coincident
as
to
admit
of
our
calling
them
in
view
of
the
other
planetary
orbits
continuing
to
shrink
the
sun
on
becoming
so
small
as
just
to
fill
the
orbit
of
mars
now
discharged
this
course
by
the
process
repeatedly
described
having
no
moon
however
mars
could
have
thrown
off
no
ring
in
fact
an
epoch
had
now
arrived
in
the
career
of
the
parent
body
the
centre
of
the
system
the
of
its
nebulosity
which
is
the
of
its
density
and
which
again
is
the
of
its
condensation
out
of
which
latter
arose
the
constant
disturbance
of
by
this
period
have
attained
a
point
at
which
the
efforts
for
restoration
would
have
been
more
and
more
ineffectual
just
in
proportion
as
they
were
less
frequently
needed
thus
the
processes
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
would
everywhere
show
signs
of
the
planets
first
and
secondly
in
the
original
mass
we
must
not
fall
into
the
error
of
supposing
the
decrease
of
interval
observed
among
the
planets
as
we
approach
the
sun
to
be
in
any
respect
indicative
of
an
increase
of
frequency
in
the
periods
at
which
they
were
discarded
exactly
the
converse
is
to
be
understood
the
longest
interval
of
time
must
have
occurred
between
the
discharges
of
the
two
interior
the
shortest
between
those
of
the
two
exterior
planets
the
decrease
of
the
interval
of
space
is
nevertheless
the
measure
of
the
density
and
thus
inversely
of
the
condensation
of
the
sun
throughout
the
processes
detailed
having
shrunk
however
so
far
as
to
fill
only
the
orbit
of
our
earth
the
parent
sphere
whirled
from
itself
still
one
other
a
condition
so
nebulous
as
to
admit
of
this
body
s
discarding
in
its
turn
yet
another
which
is
our
moon
here
terminated
the
lunar
formations
finally
subsiding
to
the
orbits
first
of
venus
and
then
of
mercury
the
sun
discarded
these
two
interior
planets
neither
of
which
has
given
birth
to
any
moon
thus
from
his
original
to
speak
more
accurately
from
the
condition
in
which
we
first
considered
a
partially
spherified
nebular
mass
much
more
than
millions
of
miles
in
great
central
orb
and
origin
of
our
system
has
gradually
descended
by
condensation
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
gravity
to
a
globe
only
miles
in
diameter
but
it
by
no
means
follows
either
that
its
condensation
is
yet
complete
or
that
it
may
not
still
possess
the
capacity
of
whirling
from
itself
another
planet
i
have
here
outline
of
course
but
still
with
all
the
detail
necessary
for
view
of
the
nebular
theory
as
its
author
himself
conceived
it
from
whatever
point
we
regard
it
we
shall
find
it
it
is
by
far
too
beautiful
indeed
to
possess
truth
as
its
here
i
am
very
profoundly
serious
in
what
i
say
in
the
revolution
of
the
satellites
of
uranus
there
does
appear
something
seemingly
inconsistent
with
the
assumptions
of
laplace
but
that
inconsistency
can
invalidate
a
theory
constructed
from
a
million
of
intricate
consistencies
is
a
fancy
fit
only
for
the
fantastic
in
prophecying
confidently
that
the
apparent
anomaly
to
which
i
refer
will
sooner
or
later
be
found
one
of
the
strongest
possible
corroborations
of
the
general
hypothesis
i
pretend
to
no
especial
spirit
of
divination
it
is
a
matter
which
the
only
difficulty
seems
to
foresee
i
am
prepared
to
show
that
the
anomalous
revolution
of
the
satellites
of
uranus
is
a
simply
perspective
anomaly
arising
from
the
inclination
of
the
axis
of
the
planet
the
bodies
whirled
off
in
the
processes
described
would
exchange
it
has
been
seen
the
superficial
of
the
orbs
whence
they
originated
for
a
of
equal
velocity
about
these
orbs
as
distant
centres
and
the
revolution
thus
engendered
must
proceed
so
long
as
the
centripetal
force
or
that
with
which
the
discarded
body
gravitates
toward
its
parent
is
neither
greater
nor
less
than
that
by
which
it
was
discarded
that
is
than
the
centrifugal
or
far
more
properly
than
the
tangential
velocity
from
the
unity
however
of
the
origin
of
these
two
forces
we
might
have
expected
to
find
them
as
they
are
one
accurately
counterbalancing
the
other
it
has
been
shown
indeed
that
the
act
of
is
in
every
case
merely
an
act
for
the
preservation
of
the
counterbalance
after
referring
however
the
centripetal
force
to
the
omniprevalent
law
of
gravity
it
has
been
the
fashion
with
astronomical
treatises
to
seek
beyond
the
limits
of
mere
is
to
say
of
solution
of
the
phænomenon
of
tangential
velocity
this
latter
they
attribute
directly
to
a
god
the
force
which
carries
a
stellar
body
around
its
primary
they
assert
to
have
originated
in
an
impulse
given
immediately
by
the
is
the
childish
phraseology
the
finger
of
deity
itself
in
this
view
the
planets
fully
formed
are
conceived
to
have
been
hurled
from
the
divine
hand
to
a
position
in
the
vicinity
of
the
suns
with
an
impetus
mathematically
adapted
to
the
masses
or
attractive
capacities
of
the
suns
themselves
an
idea
so
grossly
unphilosophical
although
so
supinely
adopted
could
have
arisen
only
from
the
difficulty
of
otherwise
accounting
for
the
absolutely
accurate
adaptation
each
to
each
of
two
forces
so
seemingly
independent
one
of
the
other
as
are
the
gravitating
and
tangential
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
for
a
long
time
the
coincidence
between
the
moon
s
rotation
and
her
sidereal
matters
seemingly
far
more
independent
than
those
now
looked
upon
as
positively
miraculous
and
there
was
a
strong
disposition
even
among
astronomers
to
attribute
the
marvel
to
the
direct
and
continual
agency
of
in
this
case
it
was
said
had
found
it
necessary
to
interpose
specially
among
his
general
laws
a
set
of
subsidiary
regulations
for
the
purpose
of
forever
concealing
from
mortal
eyes
the
glories
or
perhaps
the
horrors
of
the
other
side
of
the
that
mysterious
hemisphere
which
has
always
avoided
and
must
perpetually
avoid
the
telescopic
scrutiny
of
mankind
the
advance
of
science
however
soon
to
the
philosophical
instinct
needed
the
one
movement
is
but
a
more
even
than
a
the
other
for
my
part
i
have
no
patience
with
fantasies
at
once
so
timorous
so
idle
and
so
awkward
they
belong
to
the
veriest
of
thought
that
nature
and
the
god
of
nature
are
distinct
no
thinking
being
can
long
doubt
by
the
former
we
imply
merely
the
laws
of
the
latter
but
with
the
very
idea
of
god
omnipotent
omniscient
we
entertain
also
the
idea
of
of
his
laws
with
him
there
being
neither
past
nor
him
all
being
we
not
insult
him
in
supposing
his
laws
so
contrived
as
not
to
provide
for
every
possible
contingency
rather
what
idea
we
have
of
possible
contingency
except
that
it
is
at
once
a
result
and
a
manifestation
of
his
laws
he
who
divesting
himself
of
prejudice
shall
have
the
rare
courage
to
think
absolutely
for
himself
can
not
fail
to
arrive
in
the
end
at
the
condensation
of
into
can
not
fail
of
reaching
the
conclusion
that
law
of
nature
is
dependent
at
all
points
upon
all
other
and
that
all
are
but
consequences
of
one
primary
exercise
of
the
divine
volition
such
is
the
principle
of
the
cosmogony
which
with
all
necessary
deference
i
here
venture
to
suggest
and
to
maintain
in
this
view
it
will
be
seen
that
dismissing
as
frivolous
and
even
impious
the
fancy
of
the
tangential
force
having
been
imparted
to
the
planets
immediately
by
the
finger
of
god
i
consider
this
force
as
originating
in
the
rotation
of
the
stars
rotation
as
brought
about
by
the
of
the
primary
atoms
towards
their
respective
centres
of
aggregation
as
the
consequence
of
the
law
of
gravity
law
as
but
the
mode
in
which
is
necessarily
manifested
the
tendency
of
the
atoms
to
return
into
imparticularity
tendency
to
return
as
but
the
inevitable
rëaction
of
the
first
and
most
sublime
of
act
by
which
a
god
and
alone
existing
became
all
things
at
once
through
dint
of
his
volition
while
all
things
were
thus
constituted
a
portion
of
god
the
radical
assumptions
of
this
discourse
suggest
to
me
and
in
fact
imply
certain
important
of
the
nebular
theory
as
given
by
laplace
the
efforts
of
the
repulsive
power
i
have
considered
as
made
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
contact
among
the
atoms
and
thus
as
made
in
the
ratio
of
the
approach
to
is
to
say
in
the
ratio
of
condensation
in
other
words
with
its
involute
phænomena
heat
light
and
magnetism
is
to
be
understood
as
proceeding
as
condensation
proceeds
and
of
course
inversely
as
density
proceeds
or
the
to
thus
the
sun
in
the
process
of
its
aggregation
must
soon
in
developing
repulsion
have
become
excessively
incandescent
and
we
can
perceive
how
the
operation
of
discarding
its
rings
must
have
been
materially
assisted
by
the
slight
incrustation
of
its
surface
consequent
on
cooling
any
common
experiment
shows
us
how
readily
a
crust
of
the
character
suggested
is
separated
through
heterogeneity
from
the
interior
mass
but
on
every
successive
rejection
of
the
crust
the
new
surface
would
appear
incandescent
as
before
and
the
period
at
which
it
would
again
become
so
far
encrusted
as
to
be
readily
loosened
and
discharged
may
well
be
imagined
as
exactly
coincident
with
that
at
which
a
new
effort
would
be
needed
by
the
whole
mass
to
restore
the
equilibrium
of
its
two
forces
disarranged
through
condensation
in
other
words
the
time
the
electric
influence
repulsion
has
prepared
the
surface
for
rejection
we
are
to
understand
that
the
gravitating
influence
attraction
is
precisely
ready
to
reject
it
here
then
as
everywhere
body
and
the
soul
walk
hand
in
see
page
these
ideas
are
empirically
confirmed
at
all
points
since
condensation
can
never
in
any
body
be
considered
as
absolutely
at
an
end
we
are
warranted
in
anticipating
that
whenever
we
have
an
opportunity
of
testing
the
matter
we
shall
find
indications
of
resident
luminosity
in
the
stellar
and
planets
as
well
as
suns
that
our
moon
is
strongly
we
see
at
her
every
total
eclipse
when
if
not
so
she
would
disappear
on
the
dark
part
of
the
satellite
too
during
her
phases
we
often
observe
flashes
like
our
own
auroras
and
that
these
latter
with
our
various
other
electrical
phænomena
without
reference
to
any
more
steady
radiance
must
give
our
earth
a
certain
appearance
of
luminosity
to
an
inhabitant
of
the
moon
is
quite
evident
in
fact
we
should
regard
all
the
phænomena
referred
to
as
mere
manifestations
in
different
moods
and
degrees
of
the
earth
s
condensation
if
my
views
are
tenable
we
should
be
prepared
to
find
the
newer
is
to
say
those
nearer
the
luminous
than
those
older
and
more
remote
the
extreme
brilliancy
of
venus
on
whose
dark
portions
during
her
phases
the
auroras
are
frequently
visible
does
not
seem
to
be
altogether
accounted
for
by
her
mere
proximity
to
the
central
orb
she
is
no
doubt
vividly
although
less
so
than
mercury
while
the
luminosity
of
neptune
may
be
comparatively
nothing
admitting
what
i
have
urged
it
is
clear
that
from
the
moment
of
the
sun
s
discarding
a
ring
there
must
be
a
continuous
diminution
both
of
his
heat
and
light
on
account
of
the
continuous
encrustation
of
his
surface
and
that
a
period
would
period
immediately
previous
to
a
new
a
decrease
of
both
light
and
heat
must
become
apparent
now
we
know
that
tokens
of
such
changes
are
distinctly
recognizable
on
the
melville
adduce
merely
one
out
of
a
hundred
find
traces
of
plants
that
never
could
have
flourished
without
immensely
more
light
and
heat
than
are
at
present
afforded
by
our
sun
to
any
portion
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
such
vegetation
referable
to
an
epoch
immediately
subsequent
to
the
of
venus
at
this
epoch
must
have
occurred
to
us
our
greatest
access
of
solar
influence
and
in
fact
this
influence
must
then
have
attained
its
maximum
out
of
view
of
course
the
period
when
the
earth
itself
was
period
of
its
mere
organization
again
know
that
there
exist
is
to
say
suns
whose
existence
we
determine
through
the
movements
of
others
but
whose
luminosity
is
not
sufficient
to
impress
us
are
these
suns
invisible
merely
on
account
of
the
length
of
time
elapsed
since
their
discharge
of
a
planet
and
yet
again
we
least
in
certain
for
the
sudden
appearances
of
suns
where
none
had
been
previously
suspected
by
the
hypothesis
that
having
rolled
with
encrusted
surfaces
throughout
the
few
thousand
years
of
our
astronomical
history
each
of
these
suns
in
whirling
off
a
new
secondary
has
at
length
been
enabled
to
display
the
glories
of
its
still
incandescent
interior
the
fact
of
the
proportional
increase
of
heat
as
we
descend
into
the
earth
i
need
of
course
do
nothing
more
than
refer
comes
in
the
strongest
possible
corroboration
of
all
that
i
have
said
on
the
topic
now
at
issue
in
speaking
not
long
ago
of
the
repulsive
or
electrical
influence
i
remarked
that
the
important
phænomena
of
vitality
consciousness
and
thought
whether
we
observe
them
generally
or
in
detail
seem
to
proceed
least
in
the
ratio
of
the
i
mentioned
too
that
i
would
recur
to
the
suggestion
this
is
the
proper
point
at
which
to
do
so
looking
at
the
matter
first
in
detail
we
perceive
that
not
merely
the
of
vitality
but
its
importance
consequence
and
elevation
of
character
keep
pace
very
closely
with
the
heterogeneity
or
complexity
of
the
animal
structure
looking
at
the
question
now
in
its
generality
and
referring
to
the
first
movements
of
the
atoms
towards
we
find
that
heterogeneousness
brought
about
directly
through
condensation
is
proportional
with
it
forever
we
thus
reach
the
proposition
that
importance
of
the
development
of
the
terrestrial
vitality
proceeds
equably
with
the
terrestrial
page
now
this
is
in
precise
accordance
with
what
we
know
of
the
succession
of
animals
on
the
earth
as
it
has
proceeded
in
its
condensation
superior
and
still
superior
races
have
appeared
is
it
impossible
that
the
successive
geological
revolutions
which
have
attended
at
least
if
not
immediately
caused
these
successive
elevations
of
vitalic
it
improbable
that
these
revolutions
have
themselves
been
produced
by
the
successive
planetary
discharges
from
the
other
words
by
the
successive
variations
in
the
solar
influence
on
the
earth
were
this
idea
tenable
we
should
not
be
unwarranted
in
the
fancy
that
the
discharge
of
yet
a
new
planet
interior
to
mercury
may
give
rise
to
yet
a
new
modification
of
the
terrestrial
modification
from
which
may
spring
a
race
both
materially
and
spiritually
superior
to
man
these
thoughts
impress
me
with
all
the
force
of
i
throw
them
out
of
course
merely
in
their
obvious
character
of
suggestion
the
nebular
theory
of
laplace
has
lately
received
far
more
confirmation
than
it
needed
at
the
hands
of
the
philosopher
compte
these
two
have
thus
together
to
be
sure
that
matter
at
any
period
actually
existed
as
described
in
a
state
of
nebular
diffusion
but
that
admitting
it
so
to
have
existed
throughout
the
space
and
much
beyond
the
space
now
occupied
by
our
solar
system
to
have
commenced
a
movement
towards
a
must
gradually
have
assumed
the
various
forms
and
motions
which
are
now
seen
in
that
system
to
obtain
a
demonstration
such
as
dynamical
and
mathematical
demonstration
as
far
as
demonstration
can
and
indeed
by
that
unprofitable
and
disreputable
tribe
the
professional
mere
madmen
who
deny
the
newtonian
law
of
gravity
on
which
the
results
of
the
french
mathematicians
are
demonstration
i
say
such
as
this
would
to
most
intellects
be
i
confess
that
it
is
so
to
the
validity
of
the
nebular
hypothesis
upon
which
the
demonstration
depends
that
the
demonstration
does
not
the
hypothesis
according
to
the
common
understanding
of
the
word
proof
i
admit
of
course
to
show
that
certain
existing
certain
established
be
even
mathematically
accounted
for
by
the
assumption
of
a
certain
hypothesis
is
by
no
means
to
establish
the
hypothesis
itself
in
other
words
show
that
certain
data
being
given
a
certain
existing
result
might
or
even
have
ensued
will
fail
to
prove
that
this
result
ensue
the
until
such
time
as
it
shall
be
also
shown
that
there
are
can
no
other
data
from
which
the
result
in
question
might
have
ensued
but
in
the
case
now
discussed
although
all
must
admit
the
deficiency
of
what
we
are
in
the
habit
of
terming
proof
still
there
are
many
intellects
and
those
of
the
loftiest
order
to
which
proof
could
bring
one
iota
of
additional
without
going
into
details
which
might
impinge
upon
the
of
metaphysics
i
may
as
well
here
observe
that
the
force
of
conviction
in
cases
such
as
this
will
always
with
the
be
proportional
to
the
amount
of
intervening
between
the
hypothesis
and
the
result
to
be
less
abstract
greatness
of
the
complexity
found
existing
among
cosmical
conditions
by
rendering
great
in
the
same
proportion
the
difficulty
of
accounting
for
all
these
conditions
strengthens
also
in
the
same
proportion
our
faith
in
that
hypothesis
which
does
in
such
manner
satisfactorily
account
for
them
as
complexity
can
well
be
conceived
greater
than
that
of
the
astronomical
conditions
so
no
conviction
can
be
mind
at
that
with
which
i
am
impressed
by
an
hypothesis
that
not
only
reconciles
these
conditions
with
mathematical
accuracy
and
reduces
them
into
a
consistent
and
intelligible
whole
but
is
at
the
same
time
the
hypothesis
by
means
of
which
the
human
intellect
has
been
ever
enabled
to
account
for
them
a
most
unfounded
opinion
has
become
latterly
current
in
gossiping
and
even
in
scientific
opinion
that
the
nebular
cosmogony
has
been
overthrown
this
fancy
has
arisen
from
the
report
of
late
observations
made
among
what
hitherto
have
been
termed
the
nebulæ
through
the
large
telescope
of
cincinnati
and
the
instrument
of
lord
rosse
certain
spots
in
the
firmament
which
presented
even
to
the
most
powerful
of
the
old
telescopes
the
appearance
of
nebulosity
or
haze
had
been
regarded
for
a
long
time
as
confirming
the
theory
of
laplace
they
were
looked
upon
as
stars
in
that
very
process
of
condensation
which
i
have
been
attempting
to
describe
thus
it
was
supposed
that
we
had
ocular
evidence
evidence
by
the
way
which
has
always
been
found
very
the
truth
of
the
hypothesis
and
although
certain
telescopic
improvements
every
now
and
then
enabled
us
to
perceive
that
a
spot
here
and
there
which
we
had
been
classing
among
the
nebulæ
was
in
fact
but
a
cluster
of
stars
deriving
its
nebular
character
only
from
its
immensity
of
it
was
thought
that
no
doubt
could
exist
as
to
the
actual
nebulosity
of
numerous
other
masses
the
of
the
nebulists
bidding
defiance
to
every
effort
at
segregation
of
these
latter
the
most
interesting
was
the
great
nebulæ
in
the
constellation
orion
this
with
innumerable
other
nebulæ
when
viewed
through
the
magnificent
modern
telescopes
has
become
resolved
into
a
simple
collection
of
stars
now
this
fact
has
been
very
generally
understood
as
conclusive
against
the
nebular
hypothesis
of
laplace
and
on
announcement
of
the
discoveries
in
question
the
most
enthusiastic
defender
and
most
eloquent
popularizer
of
the
theory
nichol
went
so
far
as
to
admit
the
necessity
of
abandoning
an
idea
which
had
formed
the
material
of
his
most
praiseworthy
book
of
the
architecture
of
the
a
letter
purporting
to
be
from
nichol
to
a
friend
in
america
went
the
rounds
of
our
newspapers
about
two
years
ago
i
think
admitting
the
necessity
to
which
i
refer
in
a
subsequent
lecture
however
appears
in
some
manner
to
have
gotten
the
better
of
the
necessity
and
does
not
quite
the
theory
although
he
seems
to
wish
that
he
could
sneer
at
it
as
a
purely
hypothetical
what
else
was
the
law
of
gravity
before
the
maskelyne
experiments
and
who
questioned
the
law
of
gravity
even
then
many
of
my
readers
will
no
doubt
be
inclined
to
say
that
the
result
of
these
new
investigations
at
least
a
strong
to
overthrow
the
hypothesis
while
some
of
them
more
thoughtful
will
suggest
that
although
the
theory
is
by
no
means
disproved
through
the
segregation
of
the
particular
nebulæ
alluded
to
still
a
to
segregate
them
with
such
telescopes
might
well
have
been
understood
as
a
triumphant
of
the
theory
this
latter
class
will
be
surprised
perhaps
to
hear
me
say
that
even
with
i
disagree
if
the
propositions
of
this
discourse
have
been
comprehended
it
will
be
seen
that
in
my
view
a
failure
to
segregate
the
nebulæ
would
have
tended
to
the
refutation
rather
than
to
the
confirmation
of
the
nebular
hypothesis
let
me
explain
newtonian
law
of
gravity
we
may
of
course
assume
as
demonstrated
this
law
it
will
be
remembered
i
have
referred
to
the
rëaction
of
the
first
divine
the
rëaction
of
an
exercise
of
the
divine
volition
temporarily
overcoming
a
difficulty
this
difficulty
is
that
of
forcing
the
normal
into
the
impelling
that
whose
originality
and
therefore
whose
rightful
condition
was
to
take
upon
itself
the
wrongful
condition
of
it
is
only
by
conceiving
this
difficulty
as
overcome
that
we
can
comprehend
a
rëaction
there
could
have
been
no
rëaction
had
the
act
been
infinitely
continued
so
long
as
the
act
no
rëaction
of
course
could
commence
in
other
words
no
could
take
we
have
considered
the
one
as
but
the
manifestation
of
the
other
but
gravitation
taken
place
therefore
the
act
of
creation
has
ceased
and
gravitation
has
long
ago
taken
place
therefore
the
act
of
creation
has
long
ago
ceased
we
can
no
more
expect
then
to
observe
primary
of
creation
and
to
these
primary
processes
the
condition
of
nebulosity
has
already
been
explained
to
belong
through
what
we
know
of
the
propagation
of
light
we
have
direct
proof
that
the
more
remote
of
the
stars
have
existed
under
the
forms
in
which
we
now
see
them
for
an
inconceivable
number
of
years
so
far
back
then
as
the
period
when
these
stars
underwent
condensation
must
have
been
the
epoch
at
which
the
processes
began
that
we
may
conceive
these
processes
then
as
still
going
on
in
the
case
of
certain
nebulæ
while
in
all
other
cases
we
find
them
thoroughly
at
an
end
we
are
forced
into
assumptions
for
which
we
have
really
basis
have
to
thrust
in
again
upon
the
revolting
reason
the
blasphemous
idea
of
special
have
to
suppose
that
in
the
particular
instances
of
these
nebulæ
an
unerring
god
found
it
necessary
to
introduce
certain
supplementary
improvements
of
the
general
retouchings
and
emendations
in
a
word
which
had
the
effect
of
deferring
the
completion
of
these
individual
stars
for
centuries
of
centuries
beyond
the
æra
during
which
all
the
other
stellar
bodies
had
time
not
only
to
be
fully
constituted
but
to
grow
hoary
with
an
unspeakable
old
age
of
course
it
will
be
immediately
objected
that
since
the
light
by
which
we
recognize
the
nebulæ
now
must
be
merely
that
which
left
their
surfaces
a
vast
number
of
years
ago
the
processes
at
present
observed
or
supposed
to
be
observed
are
in
fact
processes
now
actually
going
on
but
the
phantoms
of
processes
completed
long
in
the
as
i
maintain
all
these
processes
have
been
to
this
i
reply
that
neither
is
the
condition
of
the
condensed
stars
their
actual
condition
but
a
condition
completed
long
in
the
past
so
that
my
argument
drawn
from
the
condition
of
the
stars
and
the
nebulæ
is
in
no
manner
disturbed
moreover
those
who
maintain
the
existence
of
nebulæ
do
refer
the
nebulosity
to
extreme
distance
they
declare
it
a
real
and
not
merely
a
perspective
nebulosity
that
we
may
conceive
indeed
a
nebular
mass
as
visible
at
all
we
must
conceive
it
as
near
in
comparison
with
the
condensed
stars
brought
into
view
by
the
modern
telescopes
in
maintaining
the
appearances
in
question
then
to
be
really
nebulous
we
maintain
their
comparative
vicinity
to
our
point
of
view
thus
their
condition
as
we
see
them
now
must
be
referred
to
an
epoch
less
than
that
to
which
we
may
refer
the
condition
of
at
least
the
majority
of
the
a
word
should
astronomy
ever
demonstrate
a
nebula
in
the
sense
at
present
intended
i
should
consider
the
nebular
indeed
as
corroborated
by
the
as
thereby
irretrievably
overthrown
by
way
however
of
rendering
unto
cæsar
than
the
things
that
are
cæsar
s
let
me
here
remark
that
the
assumption
of
the
hypothesis
which
led
him
to
so
glorious
a
result
seems
to
have
been
suggested
to
laplace
in
great
measure
by
a
the
very
misconception
of
which
we
have
just
been
the
generally
prevalent
misunderstanding
of
the
character
of
the
nebulæ
so
these
he
supposed
to
be
in
reality
what
their
designation
implies
the
fact
is
this
great
man
had
very
properly
an
inferior
faith
in
his
own
merely
powers
in
respect
therefore
to
the
actual
existence
of
existence
so
confidently
maintained
by
his
telescopic
depended
less
upon
what
he
saw
than
upon
what
he
heard
it
will
be
seen
that
the
only
valid
objections
to
his
theory
are
those
made
to
its
hypothesis
what
suggested
to
what
it
suggests
to
its
propositions
rather
than
to
its
results
his
most
unwarranted
assumption
was
that
of
giving
the
atoms
a
movement
towards
a
centre
in
the
very
face
of
his
evident
understanding
that
these
atoms
in
unlimited
succession
extended
throughout
the
universal
space
i
have
already
shown
that
under
such
circumstances
there
could
have
occurred
no
movement
at
all
and
laplace
consequently
assumed
one
on
no
more
philosophical
ground
than
that
something
of
the
kind
was
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
what
he
intended
to
establish
his
original
idea
seems
to
have
been
a
compound
of
the
true
epicurean
atoms
with
the
false
nebulæ
of
his
contemporaries
and
thus
his
theory
presents
us
with
the
singular
anomaly
of
absolute
truth
deduced
as
a
mathematical
result
from
a
hybrid
datum
of
ancient
imagination
intertangled
with
modern
inacumen
laplace
s
real
strength
lay
in
fact
in
an
almost
miraculous
mathematical
instinct
this
he
relied
and
in
no
instance
did
it
fail
or
deceive
him
the
case
of
the
nebular
cosmogony
it
led
him
blindfolded
through
a
labyrinth
of
error
into
one
of
the
most
luminous
and
stupendous
temples
of
truth
let
us
now
fancy
for
the
moment
that
the
ring
first
thrown
off
by
the
is
to
say
the
ring
whose
constituted
not
in
fact
break
up
until
the
of
the
ring
out
of
which
uranus
arose
that
this
latter
ring
again
remained
perfect
until
the
discharge
of
that
out
of
which
sprang
saturn
that
this
latter
again
remained
entire
until
the
discharge
of
that
from
which
originated
so
on
let
us
imagine
in
a
word
that
no
dissolution
occurred
among
the
rings
until
the
final
rejection
of
that
which
gave
birth
to
mercury
we
thus
paint
to
the
eye
of
the
mind
a
series
of
cöexistent
concentric
circles
and
looking
as
well
at
as
at
the
processes
by
which
according
to
laplace
s
hypothesis
they
were
constructed
we
perceive
at
once
a
very
singular
analogy
with
the
atomic
strata
and
the
process
of
the
original
irradiation
as
i
have
described
it
is
it
impossible
that
on
measuring
the
respectively
by
which
each
successive
planetary
circle
was
thrown
is
to
say
on
measuring
the
successive
excesses
of
rotation
over
gravitation
which
occasioned
the
successive
should
find
the
analogy
in
question
more
decidedly
confirmed
it
improbable
that
we
should
discover
these
forces
to
have
in
the
original
to
the
squares
of
the
distances
our
solar
system
consisting
in
chief
of
one
sun
with
sixteen
planets
certainly
and
possibly
a
few
more
revolving
about
it
at
various
distances
and
attended
by
seventeen
moons
assuredly
but
probably
by
several
now
to
be
considered
as
of
the
innumerable
agglomerations
which
proceeded
to
take
place
throughout
the
universal
sphere
of
atoms
on
withdrawal
of
the
divine
volition
i
mean
to
say
that
our
solar
system
is
to
be
understood
as
affording
a
of
these
agglomerations
or
more
correctly
of
the
ulterior
conditions
at
which
they
arrived
if
we
keep
our
attention
fixed
on
the
idea
of
utmost
possible
as
the
omnipotent
design
and
on
the
precautions
taken
to
accomplish
it
through
difference
of
form
among
the
original
atoms
and
particular
inequidistance
we
shall
find
it
impossible
to
suppose
for
a
moment
that
even
any
two
of
the
incipient
agglomerations
reached
precisely
the
same
result
in
the
end
we
shall
rather
be
inclined
to
think
that
stellar
bodies
in
the
suns
planets
or
particularly
while
are
generally
similar
still
less
then
can
we
imagine
any
two
of
such
two
systems
having
more
than
a
general
resemblance
our
telescopes
at
this
point
thoroughly
confirm
our
deductions
taking
our
own
solar
system
then
as
merely
a
loose
or
general
type
of
all
we
have
so
far
proceeded
in
our
subject
as
to
survey
the
universe
under
the
aspect
of
a
spherical
space
throughout
which
dispersed
with
merely
general
equability
exist
a
number
of
but
generally
similar
it
is
not
that
some
optical
improvement
may
disclose
to
us
among
innumerable
varieties
of
systems
a
luminous
sun
encircled
by
luminous
and
rings
within
and
without
and
between
which
revolve
luminous
and
planets
attended
by
moons
having
even
these
latter
again
having
moons
let
us
now
expanding
our
conceptions
look
upon
each
of
these
systems
as
in
itself
an
atom
which
in
fact
it
is
when
we
consider
it
as
but
one
of
the
countless
myriads
of
systems
which
constitute
the
universe
regarding
all
then
as
but
colossal
atoms
each
with
the
same
ineradicable
tendency
to
unity
which
characterizes
the
actual
atoms
of
which
it
enter
at
once
upon
a
new
order
of
aggregations
the
smaller
systems
in
the
vicinity
of
a
larger
one
would
inevitably
be
drawn
into
still
closer
vicinity
a
thousand
would
assemble
here
a
million
here
again
even
a
thus
immeasurable
vacancies
in
space
and
if
now
it
be
demanded
why
in
the
case
of
these
these
merely
titanic
speak
simply
of
an
assemblage
and
not
as
in
the
case
of
the
actual
atoms
of
a
more
or
less
consolidated
agglomeration
it
be
asked
for
instance
why
i
do
not
carry
what
i
suggest
to
its
legitimate
conclusion
and
describe
at
once
these
assemblages
of
as
rushing
to
consolidation
in
each
becoming
condensed
into
one
magnificent
reply
is
that
μελλοντα
am
but
pausing
for
a
moment
on
the
awful
threshold
of
for
the
present
calling
these
assemblages
clusters
we
see
them
in
the
incipient
stages
of
their
consolidation
their
consolidation
is
we
have
now
reached
a
point
from
which
we
behold
the
universe
as
a
spherical
space
interspersed
with
it
will
be
noticed
that
i
here
prefer
the
adverb
unequably
to
the
phrase
with
a
merely
general
equability
employed
before
it
is
evident
in
fact
that
the
equability
of
distribution
will
diminish
in
the
ratio
of
the
agglomerative
is
to
say
as
the
things
distributed
diminish
in
number
thus
the
increase
of
increase
which
must
continue
until
sooner
or
later
an
epoch
will
arrive
at
which
the
largest
agglomeration
will
absorb
all
the
be
viewed
as
simply
a
corroborative
indication
of
the
to
and
here
at
length
it
seems
proper
to
inquire
whether
the
ascertained
of
astronomy
confirm
the
general
arrangement
which
i
have
thus
deductively
assigned
to
the
heavens
thoroughly
they
telescopic
observation
guided
by
the
laws
of
perspective
enables
us
to
understand
that
the
perceptible
universe
exists
as
cluster
of
clusters
irregularly
the
clusters
of
which
this
universal
of
consists
are
merely
what
we
have
been
in
the
practice
of
designating
nebulæ
of
these
nebulæ
is
of
paramount
interest
to
mankind
i
allude
to
the
galaxy
or
milky
way
this
interests
us
first
and
most
obviously
on
account
of
its
great
superiority
in
apparent
size
not
only
to
any
one
other
cluster
in
the
firmament
but
to
all
the
other
clusters
taken
together
the
largest
of
these
latter
occupies
a
mere
point
comparatively
and
is
distinctly
seen
only
with
the
aid
of
a
telescope
the
galaxy
sweeps
throughout
the
heaven
and
is
brilliantly
visible
to
the
naked
eye
but
it
interests
man
chiefly
although
less
immediately
on
account
of
its
being
his
home
the
home
of
the
earth
on
which
he
exists
the
home
of
the
sun
about
which
this
earth
revolves
the
home
of
that
system
of
orbs
of
which
the
sun
is
the
centre
and
earth
one
of
sixteen
secondaries
or
moon
one
of
seventeen
tertiaries
or
satellites
the
galaxy
let
me
repeat
is
but
one
of
the
which
i
have
been
one
of
the
nebulæ
revealed
to
the
telescope
alone
faint
hazy
spots
in
various
quarters
of
the
sky
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
the
milky
way
more
extensive
than
the
least
of
these
its
vast
superiority
in
size
is
but
an
apparent
superiority
arising
from
our
position
in
regard
to
is
to
say
from
our
position
in
its
midst
however
strange
the
assertion
may
at
first
appear
to
those
unversed
in
astronomy
still
the
astronomer
himself
has
no
hesitation
in
asserting
that
we
are
the
of
that
inconceivable
host
of
constitute
the
galaxy
moreover
not
only
have
only
has
sun
a
right
to
claim
the
galaxy
as
its
own
especial
cluster
but
with
slight
reservation
it
may
be
said
that
all
the
distinctly
visible
stars
of
the
the
stars
visible
to
the
naked
equally
a
right
to
claim
it
as
own
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
misconception
in
respect
to
the
of
the
galaxy
which
in
nearly
all
our
astronomical
treatises
is
said
to
resemble
that
of
a
capital
y
the
cluster
in
question
has
in
reality
a
certain
general
resemblance
to
the
planet
saturn
with
its
encompassing
triple
ring
instead
of
the
solid
orb
of
that
planet
however
we
must
picture
to
ourselves
a
lenticular
or
collection
of
stars
our
sun
lying
the
shore
of
the
that
side
of
it
which
is
nearest
the
constellation
of
the
cross
and
farthest
from
that
of
cassiopeia
the
surrounding
ring
where
it
approaches
our
position
has
in
it
a
longitudinal
which
does
in
fact
cause
ring
in
our
to
assume
loosely
the
appearance
of
a
capital
y
we
must
not
fall
into
the
error
however
of
conceiving
the
somewhat
indefinite
girdle
as
at
all
comparatively
speaking
from
the
also
indefinite
lenticular
cluster
which
it
surrounds
and
thus
for
mere
purpose
of
explanation
we
may
speak
of
our
sun
as
actually
situated
at
that
point
of
the
y
where
its
three
component
lines
unite
and
conceiving
this
letter
to
be
of
a
certain
a
certain
thickness
very
trivial
in
comparison
with
its
may
even
speak
of
our
position
as
the
of
this
thickness
fancying
ourselves
thus
placed
we
shall
no
longer
find
difficulty
in
accounting
for
the
phænomena
are
perspective
altogether
when
we
look
upward
or
is
to
say
when
we
cast
our
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
letter
s
look
through
fewer
stars
than
when
we
cast
them
in
the
direction
of
its
or
either
of
the
three
component
lines
of
course
in
the
former
case
the
stars
appear
the
latter
reverse
this
explanation
inhabitant
of
the
earth
when
looking
as
we
commonly
express
ourselves
the
galaxy
is
then
beholding
it
in
some
of
the
directions
of
its
looking
the
lines
of
the
when
looking
out
into
the
general
heaven
he
turns
his
eyes
the
galaxy
he
is
then
surveying
it
in
the
direction
of
the
letter
s
thickness
and
on
this
account
the
stars
seem
to
him
scattered
while
in
fact
they
are
as
close
together
on
an
average
as
in
the
mass
of
the
cluster
consideration
could
be
better
adapted
to
convey
an
idea
of
this
cluster
s
stupendous
extent
if
with
a
telescope
of
high
power
we
carefully
inspect
the
firmament
we
shall
become
aware
of
belt
of
what
we
have
hitherto
called
nebulæ
of
varying
breadth
stretching
from
horizon
to
horizon
at
right
angles
to
the
general
course
of
the
milky
way
this
band
is
the
ultimate
of
this
belt
is
our
galaxy
is
but
one
and
perhaps
one
of
the
most
inconsiderable
of
the
clusters
which
go
to
the
constitution
of
this
ultimate
universal
or
the
appearance
of
this
cluster
of
clusters
to
our
eyes
a
belt
or
band
is
altogether
a
perspective
phænomenon
of
the
same
character
as
that
which
causes
us
to
behold
our
own
individual
and
cluster
the
galaxy
under
guise
also
of
a
belt
traversing
the
heavens
at
right
angles
to
the
universal
one
the
shape
of
the
cluster
is
of
course
that
of
each
individual
cluster
which
it
includes
just
as
the
scattered
stars
which
on
looking
the
galaxy
we
see
in
the
general
sky
are
in
fact
but
a
portion
of
that
galaxy
itself
and
as
closely
intermingled
with
it
as
any
of
the
telescopic
points
in
what
seems
the
densest
portion
of
its
are
the
scattered
nebulæ
which
on
casting
our
eyes
the
universal
we
perceive
at
all
points
of
the
i
say
are
these
scattered
nebulæ
to
be
understood
as
only
perspectively
scattered
and
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
one
supreme
and
universal
no
astronomical
fallacy
is
more
untenable
and
none
has
been
more
pertinaciously
adhered
to
than
that
of
the
absolute
of
the
universe
of
stars
the
reasons
for
limitation
as
i
have
already
assigned
them
seem
to
me
unanswerable
but
not
to
speak
of
these
assures
us
that
there
is
in
numerous
directions
around
us
certainly
if
not
in
all
a
positive
at
the
very
least
affords
us
no
basis
whatever
for
thinking
otherwise
were
the
succession
of
stars
endless
then
the
background
of
the
sky
would
present
us
an
uniform
luminosity
like
that
displayed
by
the
there
could
be
absolutely
no
point
in
all
that
background
at
which
would
not
exist
a
the
only
mode
therefore
in
which
under
such
a
state
of
affairs
we
could
comprehend
the
which
our
telescopes
find
in
innumerable
directions
would
be
by
supposing
the
distance
of
the
invisible
background
so
immense
that
no
ray
from
it
has
yet
been
able
to
reach
us
at
all
that
this
be
so
who
shall
venture
to
deny
i
maintain
simply
that
we
have
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
believing
that
it
so
when
speaking
of
the
vulgar
propensity
to
regard
all
bodies
on
the
earth
as
tending
merely
to
the
earth
s
centre
i
observed
that
with
certain
exceptions
to
be
specified
hereafter
every
body
on
the
earth
tended
not
only
to
the
earth
s
centre
but
in
every
conceivable
direction
the
exceptions
refer
to
those
frequent
gaps
in
the
heavens
where
our
utmost
scrutiny
can
detect
not
only
no
stellar
bodies
but
no
indications
of
their
existence
yawning
chasms
blacker
than
erebus
seem
to
afford
us
glimpses
through
the
boundary
walls
of
the
universe
of
stars
into
the
illimitable
universe
of
vacancy
beyond
now
as
any
body
existing
on
the
earth
chances
to
pass
either
through
its
own
movement
or
the
earth
s
into
a
line
with
any
one
of
these
voids
or
cosmical
abysses
it
clearly
is
no
longer
attracted
the
direction
of
that
and
for
the
moment
consequently
is
heavier
than
at
any
period
either
after
or
before
independently
of
the
consideration
of
these
voids
however
and
looking
only
at
the
generally
unequable
distribution
of
the
stars
we
see
that
the
absolute
tendency
of
bodies
on
the
earth
to
the
earth
s
centre
is
in
a
state
of
perpetual
variation
page
we
comprehend
then
the
insulation
of
our
universe
we
perceive
the
isolation
of
that
which
we
grasp
with
the
senses
we
know
that
there
exists
one
of
collection
around
which
on
all
sides
extend
the
immeasurable
wildernesses
of
a
space
all
human
untenanted
but
upon
the
confines
of
this
universe
of
stars
we
are
compelled
to
pause
through
want
of
farther
evidence
from
the
senses
is
it
right
to
conclude
that
in
fact
there
no
material
point
beyond
that
which
we
have
thus
been
permitted
to
attain
have
we
or
have
we
not
an
analogical
right
to
the
inference
that
this
perceptible
this
cluster
of
but
one
of
of
clusters
of
clusters
the
rest
of
which
are
invisible
through
the
diffusion
of
their
light
being
so
excessive
ere
it
reaches
us
as
not
to
produce
upon
our
retinas
a
from
there
being
no
such
emanation
as
light
at
all
in
these
unspeakably
distant
lastly
from
the
mere
interval
being
so
vast
that
the
electric
tidings
of
their
presence
in
space
have
not
the
lapsing
myriads
of
enabled
to
traverse
that
interval
have
we
any
right
to
we
any
ground
whatever
for
visions
such
as
these
if
we
have
a
right
to
them
in
degree
we
have
a
right
to
their
infinite
extension
the
human
brain
has
obviously
a
leaning
to
the
and
fondles
the
phantom
of
the
idea
it
seems
to
long
with
a
passionate
fervor
for
this
impossible
conception
with
the
hope
of
intellectually
believing
it
when
conceived
what
is
general
among
the
whole
race
of
man
of
course
no
individual
of
that
race
can
be
warranted
in
considering
abnormal
nevertheless
there
be
a
class
of
superior
intelligences
to
whom
the
human
bias
alluded
to
may
wear
all
the
character
of
monomania
my
question
however
remains
unanswered
we
any
right
to
us
say
rather
to
interminable
succession
of
the
clusters
of
clusters
or
of
universes
more
or
less
similar
i
reply
that
the
right
in
a
case
such
as
this
depends
absolutely
upon
the
hardihood
of
that
imagination
which
ventures
to
claim
the
right
let
me
declare
only
that
as
an
individual
i
myself
feel
impelled
to
the
daring
to
call
it
there
exist
a
succession
of
universes
more
or
less
similar
to
that
of
which
we
have
that
of
which
we
shall
ever
have
the
very
least
until
the
return
of
our
own
particular
universe
into
unity
such
clusters
of
clusters
exist
they
is
abundantly
clear
that
having
had
no
part
in
our
origin
they
have
no
portion
in
our
laws
they
neither
attract
us
nor
we
them
their
spirit
is
not
not
that
which
obtains
in
any
part
of
our
universe
they
could
not
impress
our
senses
or
our
souls
among
them
and
all
for
the
moment
are
no
influences
in
common
each
exists
apart
and
independently
the
bosom
of
its
proper
and
particular
in
the
conduct
of
this
discourse
i
am
aiming
less
at
physical
than
at
metaphysical
order
the
clearness
with
which
even
material
phænomena
are
presented
to
the
understanding
depends
very
little
i
have
long
since
learned
to
perceive
upon
a
merely
natural
and
almost
altogether
upon
a
moral
arrangement
if
then
i
seem
to
step
somewhat
too
discursively
from
point
to
point
of
my
topic
let
me
suggest
that
i
do
so
in
the
hope
of
thus
the
better
keeping
unbroken
that
chain
of
by
which
alone
the
intellect
of
man
can
expect
to
encompass
the
grandeurs
of
which
i
speak
and
in
their
majestic
totality
to
comprehend
them
so
far
our
attention
has
been
directed
almost
exclusively
to
a
general
and
relative
grouping
of
the
stellar
bodies
in
space
of
specification
there
has
been
little
and
whatever
ideas
of
have
been
is
to
say
of
number
magnitude
and
been
conveyed
incidentally
and
by
way
of
preparation
for
more
definitive
conceptions
these
latter
let
us
now
attempt
to
entertain
our
solar
system
as
has
been
already
mentioned
consists
in
chief
of
one
sun
and
sixteen
planets
certainly
but
in
all
probability
a
few
others
revolving
around
it
as
a
centre
and
attended
by
seventeen
moons
of
which
we
know
with
possibly
several
more
of
which
as
yet
we
know
nothing
these
various
bodies
are
not
true
spheres
but
oblate
flattened
at
the
poles
of
the
imaginary
axes
about
which
they
rotate
flattening
being
a
consequence
of
the
rotation
neither
is
the
sun
absolutely
the
centre
of
the
system
for
this
sun
itself
with
all
the
planets
revolves
about
a
perpetually
shifting
point
of
space
which
is
the
system
s
general
centre
of
gravity
neither
are
we
to
consider
the
paths
through
which
these
different
spheroids
moons
about
the
planets
the
planets
about
the
sun
or
the
sun
about
the
common
circles
in
an
accurate
sense
they
are
in
fact
of
the
foci
being
the
point
about
which
the
revolution
is
an
ellipse
is
a
curve
returning
into
itself
one
of
whose
diameters
is
longer
than
the
other
in
the
longer
diameter
are
two
points
equidistant
from
the
middle
of
the
line
and
so
situated
otherwise
that
if
from
each
of
them
a
straight
line
be
drawn
to
any
one
point
of
the
curve
the
two
lines
taken
together
will
be
equal
to
the
longer
diameter
itself
now
let
us
conceive
such
an
ellipse
at
one
of
the
points
mentioned
which
are
the
let
us
fasten
an
orange
by
an
elastic
thread
let
us
connect
this
orange
with
a
pea
and
let
us
place
this
latter
on
the
circumference
of
the
ellipse
let
us
now
move
the
pea
continuously
around
the
always
on
the
circumference
of
the
ellipse
the
elastic
thread
which
of
course
varies
in
length
as
we
move
the
pea
will
form
what
in
geometry
is
called
a
now
if
the
orange
be
understood
as
the
sun
and
the
pea
as
a
planet
revolving
about
it
then
the
revolution
should
be
made
at
such
a
a
velocity
so
the
may
pass
over
areas
of
space
in
equal
the
progress
of
the
pea
other
words
the
progress
of
the
planet
of
course
in
proportion
to
its
distance
from
the
in
proportion
to
its
proximity
those
planets
moreover
move
the
more
slowly
which
are
the
farther
from
the
sun
squares
of
their
periods
of
revolution
having
the
same
proportion
to
each
other
as
have
to
each
other
the
cubes
of
their
mean
distances
from
the
the
wonderfully
complex
laws
of
revolution
here
described
however
are
not
to
be
understood
as
obtaining
in
our
system
alone
they
prevail
where
attraction
prevails
they
control
every
shining
speck
in
the
firmament
is
no
doubt
a
luminous
sun
resembling
our
own
at
least
in
its
general
features
and
having
in
attendance
upon
it
a
greater
or
less
number
of
planets
greater
or
less
whose
still
lingering
luminosity
is
not
sufficient
to
render
them
visible
to
us
at
so
vast
a
distance
but
which
nevertheless
revolve
about
their
starry
centres
in
obedience
to
the
principles
just
obedience
to
the
three
omniprevalent
laws
of
three
immortal
laws
by
the
imaginative
kepler
and
but
subsequently
demonstrated
and
accounted
for
by
the
patient
and
mathematical
newton
among
a
tribe
of
philosophers
who
pride
themselves
excessively
upon
it
is
far
too
fashionable
to
sneer
at
all
speculation
under
the
comprehensive
the
point
to
be
considered
is
guesses
in
guessing
with
plato
we
spend
our
time
to
better
purpose
now
and
then
than
in
hearkening
to
a
demonstration
by
alcmæon
in
many
works
on
astronomy
i
find
it
distinctly
stated
that
the
laws
of
kepler
are
of
the
great
principle
gravitation
this
idea
must
have
arisen
from
the
fact
that
the
suggestion
of
these
laws
by
kepler
and
his
proving
them
to
have
an
actual
existence
led
newton
to
account
for
them
by
the
hypothesis
of
gravitation
and
finally
to
demonstrate
them
as
necessary
consequences
of
the
hypothetical
principle
thus
so
far
from
the
laws
of
kepler
being
the
basis
of
gravity
gravity
is
the
basis
of
these
it
is
indeed
of
all
the
laws
of
the
material
universe
which
are
not
referable
to
repulsion
alone
the
mean
distance
of
the
earth
from
the
is
to
say
from
the
heavenly
body
in
our
closest
miles
mercury
the
planet
nearest
the
sun
is
distant
from
him
millions
of
miles
venus
the
next
revolves
at
a
distance
of
millions
earth
which
comes
next
at
a
distance
of

then
at
a
distance
of
millions
now
come
the
eight
asteroids
ceres
juno
vesta
pallas
astræa
flora
iris
and
hebe
at
an
average
distance
of
about
millions
then
we
have
jupiter
distant

then
saturn
millions
then
uranus
hundred
millions
finally
neptune
lately
discovered
and
revolving
at
a
distance
say
of
hundred
millions
leaving
neptune
out
of
the
which
as
yet
we
know
little
accurately
and
which
is
possibly
one
of
a
system
of
will
be
seen
that
within
certain
limits
there
exists
an
of
among
the
planets
speaking
loosely
we
may
say
that
each
outer
planet
is
twice
as
far
from
the
sun
as
is
the
next
inner
one
may
not
the
here
not
the
law
of
deduced
from
consideration
of
the
analogy
suggested
by
me
as
having
place
between
the
solar
discharge
of
rings
and
the
mode
of
the
atomic
the
numbers
hurriedly
mentioned
in
this
summary
of
distance
it
is
folly
to
attempt
comprehending
unless
in
the
light
of
abstract
arithmetical
facts
they
are
not
practically
tangible
ones
they
convey
no
precise
ideas
i
have
stated
that
neptune
the
planet
farthest
from
the
sun
revolves
about
him
at
a
distance
of
hundred
millions
of
miles
so
far
good
have
stated
a
mathematical
fact
and
without
comprehending
it
in
the
least
we
may
put
it
to
but
in
mentioning
even
that
the
moon
revolves
about
the
earth
at
the
comparatively
trifling
distance
of
miles
i
entertained
no
expectation
of
giving
any
one
to
far
from
the
earth
the
moon
actually
there
are
perhaps
few
of
my
readers
who
have
not
crossed
the
atlantic
ocean
yet
how
many
of
them
have
a
distinct
idea
of
even
the
miles
intervening
between
shore
and
shore
i
doubt
indeed
whether
the
man
lives
who
can
force
into
his
brain
the
most
remote
conception
of
the
interval
between
one
milestone
and
its
next
neighbor
upon
the
turnpike
we
are
in
some
measure
aided
however
in
our
consideration
of
distance
by
combining
this
consideration
with
the
kindred
one
of
velocity
sound
passes
through
feet
of
space
in
a
second
of
time
now
were
it
possible
for
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
to
see
the
flash
of
a
cannon
discharged
in
the
moon
and
to
hear
the
report
he
would
have
to
wait
after
perceiving
the
former
more
than
entire
days
and
nights
before
getting
any
intimation
of
the
latter
however
feeble
be
the
impression
even
thus
conveyed
of
the
moon
s
real
distance
from
the
earth
it
will
nevertheless
effect
a
good
object
in
enabling
us
more
clearly
to
see
the
futility
of
attempting
to
grasp
such
intervals
as
that
of
the
hundred
millions
of
miles
between
our
sun
and
neptune
or
even
that
of
the
millions
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
we
inhabit
a
flying
at
the
greatest
velocity
with
which
such
a
ball
has
ever
been
known
to
fly
could
not
traverse
the
latter
interval
in
less
than
years
while
for
the
former
it
would
require
our
moon
s
real
diameter
is
miles
yet
she
is
comparatively
so
trifling
an
object
that
it
would
take
nearly
such
orbs
to
compose
one
as
great
as
the
earth
the
diameter
of
our
own
globe
is
from
the
enunciation
of
these
numbers
what
positive
idea
do
we
derive
if
we
ascend
an
ordinary
mountain
and
look
around
us
from
its
summit
we
behold
a
landscape
stretching
say
miles
in
every
direction
forming
a
circle
miles
in
circumference
and
including
an
area
of
square
miles
the
extent
of
such
a
prospect
on
account
of
the
with
which
its
portions
necessarily
present
themselves
to
view
can
be
only
very
feebly
and
very
partially
appreciated
the
entire
panorama
would
comprehend
no
more
than
one
part
of
the
mere
of
our
globe
were
this
panorama
then
to
be
succeeded
after
the
lapse
of
an
hour
by
another
of
equal
extent
this
again
by
a
third
after
the
lapse
of
another
hour
this
again
by
a
fourth
after
lapse
of
another
so
on
until
the
scenery
of
the
whole
earth
were
exhausted
and
were
we
to
be
engaged
in
examining
these
various
panoramas
for
twelve
hours
of
every
day
we
should
nevertheless
be
years
and
days
in
completing
the
general
survey
but
if
the
mere
surface
of
the
earth
eludes
the
grasp
of
the
imagination
what
are
we
to
think
of
its
cubical
contents
it
embraces
a
mass
of
matter
equal
in
weight
to
at
least
sextillions
quintillions
of
tons
let
us
suppose
it
in
a
state
of
quiescence
and
now
let
us
endeavor
to
conceive
a
mechanical
force
sufficient
to
set
it
in
motion
not
the
strength
of
all
the
myriads
of
beings
whom
we
may
conclude
to
inhabit
the
planetary
worlds
of
our
the
combined
physical
strength
of
these
admitting
all
to
be
more
powerful
than
avail
to
stir
the
ponderous
mass
single
from
its
position
what
are
we
to
understand
then
of
the
force
which
under
similar
circumstances
would
be
required
to
move
the
of
our
planets
jupiter
this
is
miles
in
diameter
and
would
include
within
its
periphery
more
than
a
thousand
orbs
of
the
magnitude
of
our
own
yet
this
stupendous
body
is
actually
flying
around
the
sun
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
is
to
say
with
a
velocity
times
greater
than
that
of
a
the
thought
of
such
a
phænomenon
can
not
well
be
said
to
the
mind
palsies
and
appals
it
not
unfrequently
we
task
our
imagination
in
picturing
the
capacities
of
an
angel
let
us
fancy
such
a
being
at
a
distance
of
some
hundred
miles
from
close
of
this
planet
as
it
speeds
on
its
annual
revolution
now
we
i
demand
fashion
for
ourselves
any
conception
so
distinct
of
this
ideal
being
s
spiritual
exaltation
as
involved
in
the
supposition
that
even
by
this
immeasurable
mass
of
matter
whirled
immediately
before
his
eyes
with
a
velocity
so
unutterable
though
he
not
at
once
struck
into
nothingness
and
overwhelmed
at
this
point
however
it
seems
proper
to
suggest
that
in
fact
we
have
been
speaking
of
comparative
trifles
our
sun
the
central
and
controlling
orb
of
the
system
to
which
jupiter
belongs
is
not
only
greater
than
jupiter
but
greater
by
far
than
all
the
planets
of
the
system
taken
together
this
fact
is
an
essential
condition
indeed
of
the
stability
of
the
system
itself
the
diameter
of
jupiter
has
been
mentioned
is
miles
of
the
sun
is
miles
an
inhabitant
of
the
latter
travelling
miles
a
day
would
be
more
than
years
in
going
round
a
great
circle
of
its
circumference
it
occupies
a
cubical
space
of
quadrillions
trillions
of
miles
the
moon
as
has
been
stated
revolves
about
the
earth
at
a
distance
of
an
orbit
consequently
of
nearly
a
million
and
a
half
now
were
the
sun
placed
upon
the
earth
centre
over
centre
the
body
of
the
former
would
extend
in
every
direction
not
only
to
the
line
of
the
moon
s
orbit
but
beyond
it
a
distance
of
miles
and
here
once
again
let
me
suggest
that
in
fact
we
have
been
speaking
of
comparative
trifles
the
distance
of
the
planet
neptune
from
the
sun
has
been
stated
is
hundred
millions
of
miles
the
circumference
of
its
orbit
therefore
is
about
billions
let
this
be
borne
in
mind
while
we
glance
at
some
one
of
the
brightest
stars
between
this
and
the
star
of
system
the
sun
there
is
a
gulf
of
space
to
convey
any
idea
of
which
we
should
need
the
tongue
of
an
archangel
from
system
then
and
from
sun
or
star
the
star
at
which
we
suppose
ourselves
glancing
is
a
thing
altogether
apart
for
the
moment
let
us
imagine
it
placed
upon
our
sun
centre
over
centre
as
we
just
now
imagined
this
sun
itself
placed
upon
the
earth
let
us
now
conceive
the
particular
star
we
have
in
mind
extending
in
every
direction
beyond
the
orbit
of
the
earth
beyond
the
orbit
of
finally
we
fancy
it
filling
the
of
miles
in
is
described
by
the
revolution
of
leverrier
s
planet
when
we
have
conceived
all
this
we
shall
have
entertained
no
extravagant
conception
there
is
the
very
best
reason
for
believing
that
many
of
the
stars
are
even
far
larger
than
the
one
we
have
imagined
i
mean
to
say
that
we
have
the
very
best
basis
for
such
belief
in
looking
back
at
the
original
atomic
arrangements
for
which
have
been
assumed
as
a
part
of
the
divine
plan
in
the
constitution
of
the
universe
we
shall
be
enabled
easily
to
understand
and
to
credit
the
existence
of
even
far
vaster
disproportions
in
stellar
size
than
any
to
which
i
have
hitherto
alluded
the
largest
orbs
of
course
we
must
expect
to
find
rolling
through
the
widest
vacancies
of
space
i
remarked
just
now
that
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
interval
between
our
sun
and
any
one
of
the
other
stars
we
should
require
the
eloquence
of
an
archangel
in
so
saying
i
should
not
be
accused
of
exaggeration
for
in
simple
truth
these
are
topics
on
which
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
exaggerate
but
let
us
bring
the
matter
more
distinctly
before
the
eye
of
the
mind
in
the
first
place
we
may
get
a
general
conception
of
the
interval
referred
to
by
comparing
it
with
the
spaces
if
for
example
we
suppose
the
earth
which
is
in
reality
millions
of
miles
from
the
sun
to
be
only
from
that
luminary
then
neptune
would
be
feet
distant
the
star
alpha
lyræ
at
the
very
now
i
presume
that
in
the
termination
of
my
last
sentence
few
of
my
readers
have
noticed
anything
especially
wrong
i
said
that
the
distance
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
being
taken
at
the
distance
of
neptune
would
be
feet
and
that
of
alpha
lyræ
the
proportion
between
one
foot
and
has
appeared
perhaps
to
convey
a
sufficiently
definite
impression
of
the
proportion
between
the
two
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
and
that
of
alpha
lyræ
from
the
same
luminary
but
my
account
of
the
matter
should
in
reality
have
run
thus
distance
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
being
taken
at
one
foot
the
distance
of
neptune
would
be
feet
and
that
of
alpha
lyræ
is
to
say
i
had
assigned
to
alpha
lyræ
in
my
first
statement
of
the
case
only
the
of
that
distance
which
is
the
distance
at
which
it
can
actually
lie
to
proceed
distant
a
mere
is
yet
when
we
look
at
it
through
a
telescope
we
see
it
under
a
certain
a
certain
appreciable
size
now
i
have
already
hinted
at
the
probable
bulk
of
many
of
the
stars
nevertheless
when
we
view
any
one
of
them
even
through
the
most
powerful
telescope
it
is
found
to
present
us
with
and
consequently
with
whatever
we
see
it
as
a
point
and
nothing
more
again
us
suppose
ourselves
walking
at
night
on
a
highway
in
a
field
on
one
side
of
the
road
is
a
line
of
tall
objects
say
trees
the
figures
of
which
are
distinctly
defined
against
the
background
of
the
sky
this
line
of
objects
extends
at
right
angles
to
the
road
and
from
the
road
to
the
horizon
now
as
we
proceed
along
the
road
we
see
these
objects
changing
their
positions
respectively
in
relation
to
a
certain
fixed
point
in
that
portion
of
the
firmament
which
forms
the
background
of
the
view
let
us
suppose
this
fixed
fixed
for
our
be
the
rising
moon
we
become
aware
at
once
that
while
the
tree
nearest
us
so
far
alters
its
position
in
respect
to
the
moon
as
to
seem
flying
behind
us
the
tree
in
the
extreme
distance
has
scarcely
changed
at
all
its
relative
position
with
the
satellite
we
then
go
on
to
perceive
that
the
farther
the
objects
are
from
us
the
less
they
alter
their
positions
and
the
converse
then
we
begin
unwittingly
to
estimate
the
distances
of
individual
trees
by
the
degrees
in
which
they
evince
the
relative
alteration
finally
we
come
to
understand
how
it
might
be
possible
to
ascertain
the
actual
distance
of
any
given
tree
in
the
line
by
using
the
amount
of
relative
alteration
as
a
basis
in
a
simple
geometrical
problem
now
this
relative
alteration
is
what
we
call
parallax
and
by
parallax
we
calculate
the
distances
of
the
heavenly
bodies
applying
the
principle
to
the
trees
in
question
we
should
of
course
be
very
much
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
the
distance
of
tree
which
however
far
we
proceeded
along
the
road
should
evince
parallax
at
all
this
in
the
case
described
is
a
thing
impossible
but
impossible
only
because
all
distances
on
our
earth
are
trivial
indeed
comparison
with
the
vast
cosmical
quantities
we
may
speak
of
them
as
absolutely
nothing
now
let
us
suppose
the
star
alpha
lyræ
directly
overhead
and
let
us
imagine
that
instead
of
standing
on
the
earth
we
stand
at
one
end
of
a
straight
road
stretching
through
space
to
a
distance
equalling
the
diameter
of
the
earth
s
is
to
say
to
a
distance
of
of
having
observed
by
means
of
the
most
delicate
micrometrical
instruments
the
exact
position
of
the
star
let
us
now
pass
along
this
inconceivable
road
until
we
reach
its
other
extremity
now
once
again
let
us
look
at
the
star
it
is
where
we
left
it
our
instruments
however
delicate
assure
us
that
its
relative
position
is
identically
the
same
as
at
the
commencement
of
our
unutterable
journey
been
found
the
fact
is
that
in
regard
to
the
distance
of
the
fixed
any
one
of
the
myriads
of
suns
glistening
on
the
farther
side
of
that
awful
chasm
which
separates
our
system
from
its
brothers
in
the
cluster
to
which
it
science
until
very
lately
could
speak
only
with
a
negative
certainty
assuming
the
brightest
as
the
nearest
we
could
say
even
of
only
that
there
is
a
certain
incomprehensible
distance
on
the
side
of
which
they
can
not
be
far
they
are
beyond
it
we
had
in
no
case
been
able
to
ascertain
we
perceived
for
example
that
alpha
lyræ
can
not
be
nearer
to
us
than
trillions
billions
of
miles
but
for
all
we
knew
and
indeed
for
all
we
now
know
it
may
be
distant
from
us
the
square
or
the
cube
or
any
other
power
of
the
number
mentioned
by
dint
however
of
wonderfully
minute
and
cautious
observations
continued
with
novel
instruments
for
many
laborious
years
not
long
ago
deceased
has
lately
succeeded
in
determining
the
distance
of
six
or
seven
stars
among
others
that
of
the
star
numbered
in
the
constellation
of
the
swan
the
distance
in
this
latter
instance
ascertained
is
times
that
of
the
sun
which
last
it
will
be
remembered
is
millions
of
miles
the
star
cygni
then
is
nearly
trillions
of
miles
from
more
than
three
times
the
distance
assigned
the
least
for
alpha
lyræ
in
attempting
to
appreciate
this
interval
by
the
aid
of
any
considerations
of
as
we
did
in
endeavoring
to
estimate
the
distance
of
the
moon
we
must
leave
out
of
sight
altogether
such
nothings
as
the
speed
of
a
or
of
sound
light
however
according
to
the
latest
calculations
of
struve
proceeds
at
the
rate
of
miles
in
a
second
thought
itself
can
not
pass
through
this
interval
more
indeed
thought
can
traverse
it
at
all
yet
in
coming
from
cygni
to
us
even
at
this
inconceivable
rate
light
occupies
more
than
and
consequently
were
the
star
this
moment
blotted
out
from
the
universe
still
ten
would
it
continue
to
sparkle
on
undimmed
in
its
paradoxical
glory
keeping
now
in
mind
whatever
feeble
conception
we
may
have
attained
of
the
interval
between
our
sun
and
cygni
let
us
remember
that
this
interval
however
unutterably
vast
we
are
permitted
to
consider
as
but
the
interval
among
the
countless
host
of
stars
composing
that
cluster
or
nebula
to
which
our
system
as
well
as
that
of
cygni
belongs
i
have
in
fact
stated
the
case
with
great
moderation
have
excellent
reason
for
believing
cygni
to
be
one
of
the
stars
and
thus
for
concluding
at
least
for
the
present
that
its
distance
from
us
is
than
the
average
distance
between
star
and
star
in
the
magnificent
cluster
of
the
milky
way
and
here
once
again
and
finally
it
seems
proper
to
suggest
that
even
as
yet
we
have
been
speaking
of
trifles
ceasing
to
wonder
at
the
space
between
star
and
star
in
our
own
or
in
any
particular
cluster
let
us
rather
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
intervals
between
cluster
and
cluster
in
the
all
comprehensive
cluster
of
the
universe
i
have
already
said
that
light
proceeds
at
the
rate
of
miles
in
a
is
about
millions
of
miles
in
a
minute
or
about
millions
of
miles
in
an
hour
so
far
removed
from
us
are
some
of
the
nebulæ
that
even
light
speeding
with
this
velocity
could
not
and
does
not
reach
us
from
those
mysterious
regions
in
less
than
of
this
calculation
moreover
is
made
by
the
elder
herschell
and
in
reference
merely
to
those
comparatively
proximate
clusters
within
the
scope
of
his
own
telescope
there
nebulæ
however
which
through
the
magical
tube
of
lord
rosse
are
this
instant
whispering
in
our
ears
the
secrets
of
million
of
in
a
word
the
events
which
we
behold
this
those
the
identical
events
which
interested
their
inhabitants
hundred
thousand
centuries
in
distances
such
as
this
suggestion
forces
upon
the
than
upon
the
find
at
length
a
fitting
climax
to
all
hitherto
frivolous
considerations
of
our
fancies
thus
occupied
with
the
cosmical
distances
let
us
take
the
opportunity
of
referring
to
the
difficulty
which
we
have
so
often
experienced
while
pursuing
beaten
of
astronomical
reflection
for
the
immeasurable
voids
alluded
comprehending
why
chasms
so
totally
unoccupied
and
therefore
apparently
so
needless
have
been
made
to
intervene
between
star
and
cluster
and
understanding
to
be
brief
a
sufficient
reason
for
the
titanic
scale
in
respect
of
mere
on
which
the
universe
is
seen
to
be
constructed
a
rational
cause
for
the
phænomenon
i
maintain
that
astronomy
has
palpably
failed
to
assign
the
considerations
through
which
in
this
essay
we
have
proceeded
step
by
step
enable
us
clearly
and
immediately
to
perceive
that
and
duration
are
that
the
universe
might
throughout
an
æra
at
all
commensurate
with
the
grandeur
of
its
component
material
portions
and
with
the
high
majesty
of
its
spiritual
purposes
it
was
necessary
that
the
original
atomic
diffusion
be
made
to
so
inconceivable
an
extent
as
to
be
only
not
infinite
it
was
required
in
a
word
that
the
stars
should
be
gathered
into
visibility
from
invisible
from
nebulosity
to
so
grow
grey
in
giving
birth
and
death
to
unspeakably
numerous
and
complex
variations
of
vitalic
development
was
required
that
the
stars
should
do
all
have
time
thoroughly
to
accomplish
all
these
divine
the
in
which
all
things
were
effecting
their
return
into
unity
with
a
velocity
accumulating
in
the
inverse
proportion
of
the
squares
of
the
distances
at
which
lay
the
inevitable
end
throughout
all
this
we
have
no
difficulty
in
understanding
the
absolute
accuracy
of
the
divine
the
density
of
the
stars
respectively
proceeds
of
course
as
their
condensation
diminishes
condensation
and
heterogeneity
keep
pace
with
each
other
through
the
latter
which
is
the
index
of
the
former
we
estimate
the
vitalic
and
spiritual
development
thus
in
the
density
of
the
globes
we
have
the
measure
in
which
their
purposes
are
fulfilled
density
the
divine
intentions
less
and
still
less
remains
the
same
we
expect
to
find
an
acceleration
of
thus
the
philosophical
mind
will
easily
comprehend
that
the
divine
designs
in
constituting
the
stars
advance
to
their
fulfilment
more
it
will
readily
give
the
advance
a
mathematical
expression
it
will
decide
that
this
advance
is
inversely
proportional
with
the
squares
of
the
distances
of
all
created
things
from
the
and
goal
of
their
creation
not
only
is
this
divine
adaptation
however
mathematically
accurate
but
there
is
that
about
it
which
stamps
it
in
distinction
from
that
which
is
merely
the
work
of
human
constructiveness
i
allude
to
the
complete
of
adaptation
for
example
in
human
constructions
a
particular
cause
has
a
particular
effect
a
particular
intention
brings
to
pass
a
particular
object
but
this
is
all
we
see
no
reciprocity
the
effect
does
not
upon
the
cause
the
intention
does
not
change
relations
with
the
object
in
divine
constructions
the
object
is
either
design
or
object
as
we
choose
to
regard
we
may
take
at
any
time
a
cause
for
an
effect
or
the
that
we
can
never
absolutely
decide
which
is
which
to
give
an
instance
polar
climates
the
human
frame
to
maintain
its
animal
heat
requires
for
combustion
in
the
capillary
system
an
abundant
supply
of
highly
azotized
food
such
as
but
again
polar
climates
nearly
the
sole
food
afforded
man
is
the
oil
of
abundant
seals
and
whales
now
whether
is
oil
at
hand
because
imperatively
demanded
or
the
only
thing
demanded
because
the
only
thing
to
be
obtained
it
is
impossible
to
decide
there
is
an
absolute
of
the
pleasure
which
we
derive
from
any
display
of
human
ingenuity
is
in
the
ratio
of
to
this
species
of
reciprocity
in
the
construction
of
for
example
in
fictitious
literature
we
should
aim
at
so
arranging
the
incidents
that
we
shall
not
be
able
to
determine
of
any
one
of
them
whether
it
depends
from
any
one
other
or
upholds
it
in
this
sense
of
course
of
is
really
or
practically
only
because
it
is
a
finite
intelligence
that
constructs
the
plots
of
god
are
perfect
the
universe
is
a
plot
of
god
and
now
we
have
reached
a
point
at
which
the
intellect
is
forced
again
to
struggle
against
its
propensity
for
analogical
its
monomaniac
grasping
at
the
infinite
moons
have
been
seen
about
planets
planets
about
stars
and
the
poetical
instinct
of
instinct
of
the
symmetrical
if
the
symmetry
be
but
a
symmetry
of
surface
which
the
soul
not
only
of
man
but
of
all
created
beings
took
up
in
the
beginning
from
the
basis
of
the
universal
us
to
the
fancy
of
an
endless
extension
of
this
system
of
closing
our
eyes
equally
to
and
we
insist
upon
imagining
a
of
all
the
orbs
of
the
galaxy
about
some
gigantic
globe
which
we
take
to
be
the
central
pivot
of
the
whole
each
cluster
in
the
great
cluster
of
clusters
is
imagined
of
course
to
be
similarly
supplied
and
constructed
while
that
the
analogy
may
be
wanting
at
no
point
we
go
on
to
conceive
these
clusters
themselves
again
as
about
some
still
more
august
sphere
latter
still
again
its
encircling
clusters
as
but
one
of
a
yet
more
magnificent
series
of
agglomerations
about
yet
another
orb
central
orb
still
more
unspeakably
orb
let
us
rather
say
of
infinite
sublimity
endlessly
multiplied
by
the
infinitely
sublime
such
are
the
conditions
continued
in
perpetuity
which
the
voice
of
what
some
people
term
analogy
calls
upon
the
fancy
to
depict
and
the
reason
to
contemplate
if
possible
without
becoming
dissatisfied
with
the
picture
such
are
the
interminable
gyrations
beyond
gyration
which
we
have
been
instructed
by
philosophy
to
comprehend
and
to
account
for
at
least
in
the
best
manner
we
can
now
and
then
however
a
philosopher
whose
phrenzy
takes
a
very
determinate
genius
to
speak
more
reverentially
has
a
washerwomanish
bias
doing
every
thing
up
by
the
us
to
see
that
point
out
of
sight
at
which
the
revolutionary
processes
in
question
do
and
of
right
ought
to
come
to
an
end
it
is
hardly
worth
while
perhaps
even
to
sneer
at
the
reveries
of
fourrier
much
has
been
said
latterly
of
the
hypothesis
of
there
exists
in
the
centre
of
the
galaxy
a
stupendous
globe
about
which
all
the
systems
of
the
cluster
revolve
the
of
our
own
indeed
has
been
millions
of
years
that
our
sun
has
a
motion
in
space
independently
of
its
rotation
and
revolution
about
the
system
s
centre
of
gravity
has
long
been
suspected
this
motion
granting
it
to
exist
would
be
manifested
perspectively
the
stars
in
that
firmamental
region
which
we
were
leaving
behind
us
would
in
a
very
long
series
of
years
become
crowded
those
in
the
opposite
quarter
scattered
now
by
means
of
astronomical
history
we
ascertain
cloudily
that
some
such
phænomena
have
occurred
on
this
ground
it
has
been
declared
that
our
system
is
moving
to
a
point
in
the
heavens
diametrically
opposite
the
star
zeta
herculis
this
inference
is
perhaps
the
maximum
to
which
we
have
any
logical
right
mädler
however
has
gone
so
far
as
to
designate
a
particular
star
alcyone
in
the
pleiades
as
being
at
or
about
the
very
spot
around
which
a
general
is
performed
now
since
by
analogy
we
are
led
in
the
first
instance
to
these
dreams
it
is
no
more
than
proper
that
we
should
abide
by
analogy
at
least
in
some
measure
during
their
development
and
that
analogy
which
suggests
the
revolution
suggests
at
the
same
time
a
central
orb
about
which
it
should
be
performed
far
the
astronomer
was
consistent
this
central
orb
however
should
dynamically
be
greater
than
all
the
orbs
taken
together
which
surround
it
of
these
there
are
about
millions
why
then
it
was
of
course
demanded
do
we
not
this
vast
central
least
in
mass
to
millions
of
such
suns
as
do
we
not
especially
who
occupy
the
mid
region
of
the
very
locality
which
at
all
events
must
be
situated
this
incomparable
star
the
reply
was
it
must
be
as
are
our
here
then
to
suit
a
purpose
analogy
is
suddenly
let
fall
not
so
it
may
be
we
know
that
suns
actually
it
is
true
that
we
have
reason
at
least
for
supposing
so
but
we
have
certainly
no
reason
whatever
for
supposing
that
the
suns
in
question
are
encircled
by
suns
while
these
again
are
surrounded
by
planets
it
is
precisely
all
this
with
which
mädler
is
called
upon
to
find
any
thing
analogous
in
the
it
is
precisely
all
this
which
he
imagines
in
the
case
of
the
galaxy
admitting
the
thing
to
be
so
we
can
not
help
here
picturing
to
ourselves
how
sad
a
puzzle
the
it
is
must
prove
to
all
philosophers
but
granting
in
the
very
teeth
of
analogy
and
of
every
thing
else
the
of
the
vast
central
orb
we
may
still
inquire
how
this
orb
so
enormous
could
fail
of
being
rendered
visible
by
the
flood
of
light
thrown
upon
it
from
the
millions
of
glorious
suns
glaring
in
all
directions
about
it
upon
the
urging
of
this
question
the
idea
of
an
actually
solid
central
sun
appears
in
some
measure
to
have
been
abandoned
and
speculation
proceeded
to
assert
that
the
systems
of
the
cluster
perform
their
revolutions
merely
about
an
immaterial
centre
of
gravity
common
to
all
here
again
then
to
suit
a
purpose
analogy
is
let
fall
the
planets
of
our
system
revolve
it
is
true
about
a
common
centre
of
gravity
but
they
do
this
in
connexion
with
and
in
consequence
of
a
material
sun
whose
mass
more
than
counterbalances
the
rest
of
the
system
the
mathematical
circle
is
a
curve
composed
of
an
infinity
of
straight
lines
but
this
idea
of
the
idea
which
in
view
of
all
ordinary
geometry
is
merely
the
mathematical
as
contradistinguished
from
the
practical
in
sober
fact
the
conception
which
alone
we
have
any
right
to
entertain
in
regard
to
the
majestic
circle
with
which
we
have
to
deal
at
least
in
fancy
when
we
suppose
our
system
revolving
about
a
point
in
the
centre
of
the
galaxy
let
the
most
vigorous
of
human
imaginations
attempt
but
to
take
a
single
step
towards
the
comprehension
of
a
sweep
so
ineffable
it
would
scarcely
be
paradoxical
to
say
that
a
flash
of
lightning
itself
travelling
upon
the
circumference
of
this
unutterable
circle
would
still
be
travelling
in
a
straight
line
that
the
path
of
our
sun
in
such
an
orbit
would
to
any
human
perception
deviate
in
the
slightest
degree
from
a
straight
line
even
in
a
million
of
years
is
a
proposition
not
to
be
entertained
we
are
required
to
believe
that
a
curvature
has
become
apparent
during
the
brief
period
of
our
astronomical
a
mere
the
utter
nothingness
of
two
or
three
thousand
years
it
may
be
said
that
mädler
really
ascertained
a
curvature
in
the
direction
of
our
system
s
now
progress
through
space
admitting
if
necessary
this
fact
to
be
in
reality
such
i
maintain
that
nothing
is
thereby
shown
except
the
reality
of
this
fact
of
a
curvature
for
its
determination
ages
will
be
required
and
when
determined
it
will
be
found
indicative
of
some
binary
or
other
multiple
relation
between
our
sun
and
some
one
or
more
of
the
proximate
stars
i
hazard
nothing
however
in
predicting
that
after
the
lapse
of
many
centuries
all
efforts
at
determining
the
path
of
our
sun
through
space
will
be
abandoned
as
fruitless
this
is
easily
conceivable
when
we
look
at
the
infinity
of
perturbation
it
must
experience
from
its
relations
with
other
orbs
in
the
common
approach
of
all
to
the
nucleus
of
the
galaxy
but
in
examining
other
nebulæ
than
that
of
the
milky
surveying
generally
the
clusters
which
overspread
the
we
or
do
we
not
find
confirmation
of
mädler
s
hypothesis
we
do
the
forms
of
the
clusters
are
exceedingly
diverse
when
casually
viewed
but
on
close
inspection
through
powerful
telescopes
we
recognize
the
sphere
very
distinctly
as
at
least
the
proximate
form
of
all
constitution
in
general
being
at
variance
with
the
idea
of
revolution
about
a
common
centre
it
is
difficult
says
sir
john
herschell
to
form
any
conception
of
the
dynamical
state
of
such
systems
on
one
hand
without
a
rotary
motion
and
a
centrifugal
force
it
is
hardly
possible
not
to
regard
them
as
in
a
state
of
on
the
other
granting
such
a
motion
and
such
a
force
we
find
it
no
less
difficult
to
reconcile
their
forms
with
the
rotation
of
the
whole
system
meaning
cluster
around
any
single
axis
without
which
internal
collision
would
appear
to
be
some
remarks
lately
made
about
the
nebulæ
by
nichol
in
taking
quite
a
different
view
of
the
cosmical
conditions
from
any
taken
in
this
a
very
peculiar
applicability
to
the
point
now
at
issue
he
says
when
our
greatest
telescopes
are
brought
to
bear
upon
them
we
find
that
those
which
were
thought
to
be
irregular
are
not
so
they
approach
nearer
to
a
globe
here
is
one
that
looked
oval
but
lord
rosse
s
telescope
brought
it
into
a
circle
now
there
occurs
a
very
remarkable
circumstance
in
reference
to
these
comparatively
sweeping
circular
masses
of
nebulæ
we
find
they
are
not
entirely
circular
but
the
reverse
and
that
all
around
them
on
every
side
there
are
volumes
of
stars
out
apparently
as
if
they
were
rushing
towards
a
great
central
mass
in
consequence
of
the
action
of
some
great
i
must
be
understood
as
denying
only
the
portion
of
mädler
s
hypothesis
of
course
if
no
great
central
orb
exists
in
our
cluster
such
will
exist
hereafter
whenever
existing
it
will
be
merely
the
of
the
consolidation
were
i
to
describe
in
my
own
words
what
must
necessarily
be
the
existing
condition
of
each
nebula
on
the
hypothesis
that
all
matter
is
as
i
suggest
now
returning
to
its
original
unity
i
should
simply
be
going
over
nearly
verbatim
the
language
here
employed
by
nichol
without
the
faintest
suspicion
of
that
stupendous
truth
which
is
the
key
to
these
nebular
phænomena
and
here
let
me
fortify
my
position
still
farther
by
the
voice
of
a
greater
than
one
moreover
to
whom
all
the
data
of
mädler
have
long
been
familiar
things
carefully
and
thoroughly
considered
referring
to
the
elaborate
calculations
of
very
researches
which
form
mädler
s
whose
generalizing
powers
have
never
perhaps
been
equalled
has
the
following
observation
when
we
regard
the
real
proper
or
motions
of
the
stars
we
find
groups
of
them
moving
in
opposite
and
the
data
as
yet
in
hand
render
it
not
necessary
at
least
to
conceive
that
the
systems
composing
the
milky
way
or
the
clusters
generally
composing
the
universe
are
revolving
about
any
particular
centre
unknown
whether
luminous
or
it
is
but
man
s
longing
for
a
fundamental
first
cause
that
impels
both
his
intellect
and
his
fancy
to
the
adoption
of
such
an
betrachtet

die
nicht
perspectivischen
eigenen
bewegungen
der

scheinen
viele

die

es
auf

nicht

anzunehmen
dass
alle

unserer

oder
gar
der
gesammten

welche
den

füllen
sich
um
einen
grossen
unbekannten

nach

und
höchsten

macht
freilich
die
reflectirende

des

wie
seine
phantasie
zu
einer
solchen
annahme
geneigt
the
phænomenon
here
alluded
of
many
groups
moving
in
opposite
directions
quite
inexplicable
by
mädler
s
idea
but
arises
as
a
necessary
consequence
from
that
which
forms
the
basis
of
this
discourse
while
the
general
of
each
each
moon
planet
star
or
on
my
hypothesis
be
of
course
absolutely
rectilinear
while
the
path
of
all
bodies
would
be
a
right
line
leading
to
the
centre
of
all
it
is
clear
nevertheless
that
this
general
rectilinearity
would
be
compounded
of
what
with
scarcely
any
exaggeration
we
may
term
an
infinity
of
particular
infinity
of
local
deviations
from
result
of
continuous
differences
of
relative
position
among
the
multitudinous
masses
as
each
proceeded
on
its
own
proper
journey
to
the
end
i
quoted
just
now
from
sir
john
herschell
the
following
words
used
in
reference
to
the
clusters
on
one
hand
without
a
rotary
motion
and
a
centrifugal
force
it
is
hardly
possible
not
to
regard
them
as
in
a
state
of
the
fact
is
that
in
surveying
the
nebulæ
with
a
telescope
of
high
power
we
shall
find
it
quite
impossible
having
once
conceived
this
idea
of
collapse
not
to
gather
at
all
points
corroboration
of
the
idea
a
nucleus
is
always
apparent
in
the
direction
of
which
the
stars
seem
to
be
precipitating
themselves
nor
can
these
nuclei
be
mistaken
for
merely
perspective
phænomena
clusters
are
denser
near
the
in
the
regions
more
remote
from
it
in
a
word
we
see
every
thing
as
we
see
it
were
a
collapse
taking
place
but
in
general
it
may
be
said
of
these
clusters
that
we
can
fairly
entertain
while
looking
at
them
the
idea
of
movement
about
a
only
by
admitting
the
existence
in
the
distant
domains
of
space
of
dynamical
laws
with
which
are
unacquainted
on
the
part
of
herschell
however
there
is
evidently
to
regard
the
nebulæ
as
in
a
state
of
progressive
but
if
even
appearances
justify
the
supposition
of
their
being
in
this
state
it
may
well
be
demanded
is
he
disinclined
to
admit
it
simply
on
account
of
a
prejudice
because
the
supposition
is
at
war
with
a
preconceived
and
utterly
baseless
of
the
of
the
eternal
stability
of
the
universe
if
the
propositions
of
this
discourse
are
tenable
the
state
of
progressive
collapse
is
that
state
in
which
alone
we
are
warranted
in
considering
all
things
and
with
due
humility
let
me
here
confess
that
for
my
part
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
any
understanding
of
the
existing
condition
of
affairs
could
ever
have
made
its
way
into
the
human
brain
the
tendency
to
collapse
and
the
attraction
of
gravitation
are
convertible
phrases
in
using
either
we
speak
of
the
rëaction
of
the
first
act
never
was
necessity
less
obvious
than
that
of
supposing
matter
imbued
with
an
ineradicable
forming
part
of
its
material
quality
or
instinct
inseparable
from
it
and
by
dint
of
which
inalienable
principle
every
atom
is
impelled
to
seek
its
never
was
necessity
less
obvious
than
that
of
entertaining
this
unphilosophical
idea
going
boldly
behind
the
vulgar
thought
we
have
to
conceive
metaphysically
that
the
gravitating
principle
appertains
to
matter
while
while
existing
as
many
instead
of
as
to
it
by
virtue
of
its
state
of
irradiation
in
a
word
altogether
to
its
and
not
in
the
slightest
degree
to
in
this
view
when
the
irradiation
shall
have
returned
into
its
the
rëaction
shall
be
gravitating
principle
will
no
longer
exist
and
in
fact
astronomers
without
at
any
time
reaching
the
idea
here
suggested
seem
to
have
been
approximating
it
in
the
assertion
that
if
there
were
but
one
body
in
the
universe
it
would
be
impossible
to
understand
how
the
principle
gravity
could
obtain
is
to
say
from
a
consideration
of
matter
as
they
find
it
they
reach
a
conclusion
at
which
i
deductively
arrive
that
so
pregnant
a
suggestion
as
the
one
just
quoted
should
have
been
permitted
to
remain
so
long
unfruitful
is
nevertheless
a
mystery
which
i
find
it
difficult
to
fathom
it
is
perhaps
in
no
little
degree
however
our
propensity
for
the
the
the
present
case
more
particularly
for
the
has
been
leading
us
astray
and
in
fact
the
sense
of
the
symmetrical
is
an
instinct
which
may
be
depended
upon
with
an
almost
blindfold
reliance
it
is
the
poetical
essence
of
the
the
which
in
the
supremeness
of
its
symmetry
is
but
the
most
sublime
of
poems
now
symmetry
and
consistency
are
convertible
terms
poetry
and
truth
are
one
a
thing
is
consistent
in
the
ratio
of
its
in
the
ratio
of
its
consistency
perfect
consistency
i
repeat
can
be
nothing
but
an
absolute
we
may
take
it
for
granted
then
that
man
can
not
long
or
widely
err
if
he
suffer
himself
to
be
guided
by
his
poetical
which
i
have
maintained
to
be
his
truthful
in
being
his
symmetrical
instinct
he
must
have
a
care
however
lest
in
pursuing
too
heedlessly
the
superficial
symmetry
of
forms
and
motions
he
leave
out
of
sight
the
really
essential
symmetry
of
the
principles
which
determine
and
control
them
that
the
stellar
bodies
would
finally
be
merged
in
at
last
all
would
be
drawn
into
the
substance
of
stupendous
central
orb
already
an
idea
which
for
some
time
past
seems
vaguely
and
indeterminately
to
have
held
possession
of
the
fancy
of
mankind
it
is
an
idea
in
fact
which
belongs
to
the
class
of
the
it
springs
instantly
from
a
superficial
observation
of
the
cyclic
and
seemingly
or
movements
of
those
individual
portions
of
the
universe
which
come
most
immediately
and
most
closely
under
our
observation
there
is
not
perhaps
a
human
being
of
ordinary
education
and
of
average
reflective
capacity
to
whom
at
some
period
the
fancy
in
question
has
not
occurred
as
if
spontaneously
or
intuitively
and
wearing
all
the
character
of
a
very
profound
and
very
original
conception
this
conception
however
so
commonly
entertained
has
never
within
my
knowledge
arisen
out
of
any
abstract
considerations
being
on
the
contrary
always
suggested
as
i
say
by
the
vorticial
movements
about
centres
a
reason
for
it
also
for
the
ingathering
of
all
the
orbs
into
one
to
be
already
was
naturally
sought
in
the
same
these
cyclic
movements
themselves
thus
it
happened
that
on
announcement
of
the
gradual
and
perfectly
regular
decrease
observed
in
the
orbit
of
enck
s
comet
at
every
successive
revolution
about
our
sun
astronomers
were
nearly
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
the
cause
in
question
was
a
principle
was
discovered
sufficient
to
account
physically
for
that
final
universal
agglomeration
which
i
repeat
the
analogical
symmetrical
or
poetical
instinct
of
man
had
predetermined
to
understand
as
something
more
than
a
simple
hypothesis
this
sufficient
reason
for
the
final
declared
to
exist
in
an
exceedingly
rare
but
still
material
medium
pervading
space
which
medium
by
retarding
in
some
degree
the
progress
of
the
comet
perpetually
weakened
its
tangential
force
thus
giving
a
predominance
to
the
centripetal
which
of
course
drew
the
comet
nearer
and
nearer
at
each
revolution
and
would
eventually
precipitate
it
upon
the
sun
all
this
was
strictly
the
medium
or
ether
but
this
ether
was
assumed
most
illogically
on
the
ground
that
no
mode
than
the
one
spoken
of
could
be
discovered
of
accounting
for
the
observed
decrease
in
the
orbit
of
the
comet
if
from
the
fact
that
we
could
no
other
mode
of
accounting
for
it
it
followed
in
any
respect
that
no
other
mode
of
accounting
for
it
existed
it
is
clear
that
innumerable
causes
might
operate
in
combination
to
diminish
the
orbit
without
even
a
possibility
of
our
ever
becoming
acquainted
with
one
of
them
in
the
meantime
it
has
never
been
fairly
shown
perhaps
why
the
retardation
occasioned
by
the
skirts
of
the
sun
s
atmosphere
through
which
the
comet
passes
at
perihelion
is
not
enough
to
account
for
the
phænomenon
that
enck
s
comet
will
be
absorbed
into
the
sun
is
probable
that
all
the
comets
of
the
system
will
be
absorbed
is
more
than
merely
possible
but
in
such
case
the
principle
of
absorption
must
be
referred
to
eccentricity
of
the
close
approximation
to
the
sun
of
the
comets
at
their
perihelia
and
is
a
principle
not
affecting
in
any
degree
the
ponderous
which
are
to
be
regarded
as
the
true
material
constituents
of
the
comets
in
general
let
me
here
suggest
in
passing
that
we
can
not
be
far
wrong
in
looking
upon
them
as
the
of
the
cosmical
the
idea
of
a
retarding
ether
and
through
it
of
a
final
agglomeration
of
all
things
seemed
at
one
time
however
to
be
confirmed
by
the
observation
of
a
positive
decrease
in
the
orbit
of
the
solid
moon
by
reference
to
eclipses
recorded
years
ago
it
was
found
that
the
velocity
of
the
satellite
s
revolution
was
considerably
less
than
it
is
that
on
the
hypothesis
that
its
motions
in
its
orbit
is
uniformly
in
accordance
with
kepler
s
law
and
was
accurately
determined
years
is
now
in
advance
of
the
position
it
occupy
by
nearly
miles
the
increase
of
velocity
proved
of
course
a
diminution
of
orbit
and
astronomers
were
fast
yielding
to
a
belief
in
an
ether
as
the
sole
mode
of
accounting
for
the
phænomenon
when
lagrange
came
to
the
rescue
he
showed
that
owing
to
the
configurations
of
the
spheroids
the
shorter
axes
of
their
ellipses
are
subject
to
variation
in
length
the
longer
axes
being
permanent
and
that
this
variation
is
continuous
and
that
every
orbit
is
in
a
state
of
transition
either
from
circle
to
ellipse
or
from
ellipse
to
circle
in
the
case
of
the
moon
where
the
shorter
axis
is
the
orbit
is
passing
from
circle
to
ellipse
and
consequently
is
too
but
after
a
long
series
of
ages
the
ultimate
eccentricity
will
be
attained
then
the
shorter
axis
will
proceed
to
until
the
orbit
becomes
a
circle
when
the
process
of
shortening
will
again
take
place
so
on
forever
in
the
case
of
the
earth
the
orbit
is
passing
from
ellipse
to
circle
the
facts
thus
demonstrated
do
away
of
course
with
all
necessity
for
supposing
an
ether
and
with
all
apprehension
of
the
system
s
the
ether
s
account
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
have
myself
assumed
what
we
may
term
i
have
spoken
of
a
subtle
which
we
know
to
be
ever
in
attendance
upon
matter
although
becoming
manifest
only
through
matter
s
heterogeneity
to
this
daring
to
touch
it
at
all
in
any
effort
at
explaining
its
awful
have
referred
the
various
phænomena
of
electricity
heat
light
magnetism
and
vitality
consciousness
and
a
word
of
spirituality
it
will
be
seen
at
once
then
that
the
ether
thus
conceived
is
radically
distinct
from
the
ether
of
the
astronomers
inasmuch
as
theirs
is
and
mine
with
the
idea
of
a
material
ether
seems
thus
to
have
departed
altogether
the
thought
of
that
universal
agglomeration
so
long
predetermined
by
the
poetical
fancy
of
mankind
agglomeration
in
which
a
sound
philosophy
might
have
been
warranted
in
putting
faith
at
least
to
a
certain
extent
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
by
this
poetical
fancy
it
been
so
predetermined
but
so
far
as
far
as
mere
physics
have
yet
spoken
the
cycles
of
the
universe
are
universe
has
no
conceivable
end
had
an
end
been
demonstrated
however
from
so
purely
collateral
a
cause
as
an
ether
man
s
instinct
of
the
divine
to
would
have
rebelled
against
the
demonstration
we
should
have
been
forced
to
regard
the
universe
with
some
such
sense
of
dissatisfaction
as
we
experience
in
contemplating
an
unnecessarily
complex
work
of
human
art
creation
would
have
affected
us
as
an
imperfect
in
a
romance
where
the
is
awkwardly
brought
about
by
interposed
incidents
external
and
foreign
to
the
main
subject
instead
of
springing
out
of
the
bosom
of
the
of
the
heart
of
the
ruling
of
arising
as
a
result
of
the
primary
inseparable
and
inevitable
part
and
parcel
of
the
fundamental
conception
of
the
book
what
i
mean
by
the
symmetry
of
mere
surface
will
now
be
more
clearly
understood
it
is
simply
by
the
blandishment
of
this
symmetry
that
we
have
been
beguiled
into
the
general
idea
of
which
mädler
s
hypothesis
is
but
a
idea
of
the
vorticial
indrawing
of
the
orbs
dismissing
this
nakedly
physical
conception
the
symmetry
of
principle
sees
the
end
of
all
things
metaphysically
involved
in
the
thought
of
a
beginning
seeks
and
finds
in
this
origin
of
all
things
the
of
this
end
and
perceives
the
impiety
of
supposing
this
end
likely
to
be
brought
about
less
through
rëaction
of
the
originating
recurring
then
to
a
previous
suggestion
let
us
understand
the
us
understand
each
star
with
its
attendant
but
a
titanic
atom
existing
in
space
with
precisely
the
same
inclination
for
unity
which
characterized
in
the
beginning
the
actual
atoms
after
their
irradiation
throughout
the
universal
sphere
as
these
original
atoms
rushed
towards
each
other
in
generally
straight
lines
so
let
us
conceive
as
at
least
generally
rectilinear
the
paths
of
the
towards
their
respective
centres
of
aggregation
in
this
direct
drawing
together
of
the
systems
into
clusters
with
a
similar
and
simultaneous
drawing
together
of
the
clusters
themselves
while
undergoing
consolidation
we
have
at
length
attained
the
great
awful
existing
condition
of
the
universe
of
the
still
more
awful
future
a
not
irrational
analogy
may
guide
us
in
framing
an
hypothesis
the
equilibrium
between
the
centripetal
and
centrifugal
forces
of
each
system
being
necessarily
destroyed
upon
attainment
of
a
certain
proximity
to
the
nucleus
of
the
cluster
to
which
it
belongs
there
must
occur
at
once
a
chaotic
or
seemingly
chaotic
precipitation
of
the
moons
upon
the
planets
of
the
planets
upon
the
suns
and
of
the
suns
upon
the
nuclei
and
the
general
result
of
this
precipitation
must
be
the
gathering
of
the
myriad
stars
of
the
firmament
into
an
almost
infinitely
less
number
of
almost
infinitely
superior
spheres
in
being
immeasurably
fewer
the
worlds
of
that
day
will
be
immeasurably
greater
than
our
own
then
indeed
amid
unfathomable
abysses
will
be
glaring
unimaginable
suns
but
all
this
will
be
merely
a
climacic
magnificence
foreboding
the
great
end
of
this
end
the
new
genesis
described
can
be
but
a
very
partial
postponement
while
undergoing
consolidation
the
clusters
themselves
with
a
speed
prodigiously
accumulative
have
been
rushing
towards
their
own
general
now
with
a
electric
velocity
commensurate
only
with
their
material
grandeur
and
with
the
spiritual
passion
of
their
appetite
for
oneness
the
majestic
remnants
of
the
tribe
of
stars
flash
at
length
into
a
common
embrace
the
inevitable
catastrophe
is
at
hand
but
this
is
it
we
have
seen
accomplished
the
ingathering
of
the
orbs
henceforward
are
we
not
to
understand
material
globe
of
as
constituting
and
comprehending
the
universe
such
a
fancy
would
be
altogether
at
war
with
every
assumption
and
consideration
of
this
discourse
i
have
already
alluded
to
that
absolute
of
which
is
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
divine
it
divine
up
to
this
point
of
our
reflections
we
have
been
regarding
the
electrical
influence
as
a
something
by
dint
of
whose
repulsion
alone
matter
is
enabled
to
exist
in
that
state
of
diffusion
demanded
for
the
fulfilment
of
its
purposes
far
in
a
word
we
have
been
considering
the
influence
in
question
as
ordained
for
matter
s
subserve
the
objects
of
matter
with
a
perfectly
legitimate
reciprocity
we
are
now
permitted
to
look
at
matter
as
created
for
the
sake
of
this
to
serve
the
objects
of
this
spiritual
ether
through
the
the
the
agency
of
matter
and
by
dint
of
its
this
ether
it
is
merely
in
the
development
of
this
ether
through
heterogeneity
that
particular
masses
of
matter
become
in
the
ratio
of
their
heterogeneity
reaching
a
degree
of
sensitiveness
involving
what
we
call
and
thus
attaining
conscious
intelligence
in
this
view
we
are
enabled
to
perceive
matter
as
a
as
an
end
its
purposes
are
thus
seen
to
have
been
comprehended
in
its
diffusion
and
with
the
return
into
unity
these
purposes
cease
the
absolutely
consolidated
globe
of
globes
would
be
not
for
a
moment
could
it
continue
to
exist
matter
created
for
an
end
would
unquestionably
on
fulfilment
of
that
end
be
matter
no
longer
let
us
endeavor
to
understand
that
it
would
disappear
and
that
god
would
remain
all
in
all
that
every
work
of
divine
conception
must
cöexist
and
cöexpire
with
its
particular
design
seems
to
me
especially
obvious
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
on
perceiving
the
final
globe
of
globes
to
be
the
majority
of
my
readers
will
be
satisfied
with
my
it
can
not
continue
to
nevertheless
as
the
startling
thought
of
its
instantaneous
disappearance
is
one
which
the
most
powerful
intellect
can
not
be
expected
readily
to
entertain
on
grounds
so
decidedly
abstract
let
us
endeavor
to
look
at
the
idea
from
some
other
and
more
ordinary
point
of
view
us
see
how
thoroughly
and
beautifully
it
is
corroborated
in
an
consideration
of
matter
as
we
actually
find
it
i
have
before
said
that
attraction
and
repulsion
being
undeniably
the
sole
properties
by
which
matter
is
manifested
to
mind
we
are
justified
in
assuming
that
matter
only
as
attraction
and
other
words
that
attraction
and
repulsion
matter
there
being
no
conceivable
case
in
which
we
may
not
employ
the
term
matter
and
the
terms
attraction
and
repulsion
taken
together
as
equivalent
and
therefore
convertible
expressions
in
page
now
the
very
definition
of
attraction
implies
existence
of
parts
particles
or
atoms
for
we
define
it
as
the
tendency
of
each
atom
to
every
other
atom
according
to
a
certain
law
of
course
where
there
are
there
is
absolute
the
tendency
to
oneness
is
can
be
no
attraction
has
been
fully
shown
and
all
philosophy
admits
it
when
on
fulfilment
of
its
purposes
then
matter
shall
have
returned
into
its
original
condition
of
condition
which
presupposes
the
expulsion
of
the
separative
ether
whose
province
and
whose
capacity
are
limited
to
keeping
the
atoms
apart
until
that
great
day
when
this
ether
being
no
longer
needed
the
overwhelming
pressure
of
the
finally
collective
attraction
shall
at
length
just
sufficiently
predominate
and
expel
it
i
say
matter
finally
expelling
the
ether
shall
have
returned
into
absolute
unity
will
then
to
speak
paradoxically
for
the
moment
be
matter
without
attraction
and
without
other
words
matter
without
other
words
again
no
in
sinking
into
unity
it
will
sink
at
once
into
that
nothingness
which
to
all
finite
perception
unity
must
that
material
nihility
from
which
alone
we
can
conceive
it
to
have
been
have
been
by
the
volition
of
god
gravity
therefore
must
be
the
strongest
of
page
i
repeat
us
endeavor
to
comprehend
that
the
final
globe
of
globes
will
instantaneously
disappear
and
that
god
will
remain
all
in
all
but
are
we
here
to
pause
not
so
on
the
universal
agglomeration
and
dissolution
we
can
readily
conceive
that
a
new
and
perhaps
totally
different
series
of
conditions
may
creation
and
irradiation
returning
into
action
and
rëaction
of
the
divine
will
guiding
our
imaginations
by
that
omniprevalent
law
of
laws
the
law
of
periodicity
are
we
not
indeed
more
than
justified
in
entertaining
a
us

rather
in
indulging
a
the
processes
we
have
here
ventured
to
contemplate

be
renewed
forever

forever
a
novel

into

of
this

our

from
that
cool
exercise
of
that
deep
tranquillity
of
which
alone
we
can
hope
to
attain
the
presence
of
this
the
most
sublime
of
truths
and
look
it
leisurely
in
the
face
the
on
which
our
conclusions
must
at
this
point
depend
are
merely
spiritual
shadows
but
not
the
less
thoroughly
substantial
we
walk
about
amid
the
destinies
of
our
encompassed
by
dim
but
ever
present
of
a

more
distant
in
the

awful

haunted
by
such
dreams

clear
to

us
even
for
a
moment
so
long
as
this

endures
the
feeling
we
is
the
most
natural
of
all
feelings
we
understand
it
that
there
was
a
period
at
which
we
did
that
it
might
so
have
happened
that
we
never
had
existed

the

indeed
which
this
we
find
difficulty
in
understanding
why
we
should

to
the
epoch
of
our
of
all
queries
the
most
unanswerable
from
all
time
and
to
all
up
to
the
epoch
of
manhood
a
normal
and
unquestionable
condition
because
it
but
now
comes
the
period
at
which
a
conventional
awakens
us
from
the
truth
of
our
dream
doubt
surprise
and
incomprehensibility
arrive
at
the

greater
than
your

it

only
through
this

live
at
these

not

at

the

the
omniprevalent
aspirations
at
perfection
are
but
the
spiritual
coincident
with
the
material
struggles
towards
the
original
to
my
mind
at
least
a
species
of
proof
far
surpassing
what

that
no
one
soul
inferior
to
nothing
is
or
can
be
superior

its
own
own

that
material
spiritual
exists
solely
in
the
diffused

spirit
of
the

and
that
the
regathering
of
this
diffused

spirit
will
be
but
the
of
the

individual
god

this

comprehend
the
riddles
of

inexorable
fate

the

of
evil
becomes
intelligible

in
this
view

endurable

no

speak
to
us
with
low
voices
saying
there
was
an
epoch
in
the
night
of
time
when

an
absolutely
infinite
number
of
similar
beings
that
people
the
absolutely
infinite
domains
of
the
absolutely
infinite
space
it

not
in
the
power
of
this
more
than
it
is
in
your
extend
by
actual
increase
the
joy
of
his
existence
but
just
as
it
in
your
power
to
expand
or
to
concentrate
your
pleasures
the
absolute
amount
of
happiness
remaining
always
the
same
so
did
and
does
a
similar
capability
appertain
to
this
divine
being
who
thus
passes
his
eternity
in
perpetual
variation
of
concentrated
self
and
almost
infinite
what
you
call
the
universe
is
but
his
present
expansive
existence
he
now
feels
his
life
through
an
infinity
of
imperfect
partial
and
pleasures
of
those
inconceivably
numerous
things
which
you
designate
as
his
creatures
but
which
are
really
but
infinite
individualizations
of
himself
all
these
which
you
term
animate
as
well
as
those
to
whom
you
deny
life
for
no
better
reason
than
that
you
do
not
behold
it
in
these
creatures
have
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
a
capacity
for
pleasure
and
for
pain
the
general
sum
of
their
sensations
is
precisely
that
amount
of
happiness
which
appertains
by

to
the
divine
being

this

recommends
itself
particularly
to
the
attention
of
every
american
student
who
glories
in
his
descent

teutonic
lineage
as
well
as
of
all
who
desire
an
acquaintance
with
a
language
which
lies
as
the
foundation
of
the

throws
a
light
upon
its
elements
and
structure
derivable
from
no
other
source
of
the
importance
and
interesting
nature
of
the
study

can
be
no

and
we
agree
with
those
who

that

utterly
disgraceful
for
any
englishman
or
american
to
have
neglected
it

regard
to

merits

we
will
only
say
that

we
may
add
learning

set
forth
