i
a
pious
hyperbole
before
my
coronation
there
was
no
event
in
childhood
that
impressed
itself
on
my
memory
with
marked
or
singular
distinction
my
death
the
result
of
a
chill
contracted
during
a
hunting
excursion
meant
no
more
to
me
than
a
week
of
rooms
gloomy
and
games
forbidden
the
decease
of
king
augustin
my
uncle
appeared
at
the
first
instant
of
even
less
importance
i
recollect
the
news
coming
the
king
having
been
always
in
frail
health
had
never
married
seeing
clearly
but
not
far
he
was
a
sad
man
the
fate
that
struck
down
his
brother
increased
his
natural
melancholy
he
became
almost
a
recluse
withdrew
himself
from
the
capital
to
a
retired
residence
and
henceforward
was
little
more
than
a
name
in
which
prince
von
hammerfeldt
conducted
the
business
of
the
country
now
and
then
my
mother
visited
him
once
she
brought
back
to
me
a
letter
from
him
little
of
which
i
understood
then
although
i
have
since
read
often
the
touching
words
of
his
message
when
he
died
there
was
the
same
gloom
as
when
my
father
left
us
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
treated
a
little
differently
the
servants
stared
at
me
my
mother
would
look
long
at
me
with
a
expression
and
victoria
let
me
have
all
her
toys
in
baroness
von
krakenstein
or
krak
as
we
called
her
alone
there
was
no
difference
yet
the
explanation
came
from
her
for
when
that
evening
i
reached
out
my
little
hand
and
snatched
a
bit
of
cake
from
the
dish
krak
caught
my
wrist
saying
gravely
kings
must
not
snatch
augustin
victoria
what
do
you
get
when
you
are
a
king
i
asked
my
sister
that
night
i
was
hardly
eight
she
nearing
ten
and
her
worldly
wisdom
seemed
great
oh
you
have
just
what
you
want
and
do
what
you
like
and
kill
people
that
you
do
like
said
she
do
you
remember
the
arabian
nights
could
i
kill
krak
i
asked
choosing
a
concrete
and
tempting
illustration
of
despotic
power
victoria
was
puzzled
she
have
to
do
something
first
i
suppose
she
answered
vaguely
i
should
have
been
queen
if
you
had
been
born
augustin
her
tone
now
became
rather
plaintive
but
nobody
has
a
queen
if
they
can
get
a
king
said
i
serenely
it
is
the
coronation
day
that
stands
out
in
memory
the
months
that
elapsed
between
my
accession
and
that
event
are
merged
in
a
vague
dimness
i
think
little
difference
was
made
in
our
household
while
we
mourned
the
dead
king
krak
was
still
sharp
imperious
and
exacting
she
had
been
my
mother
governess
and
came
with
her
from
styria
i
suppose
she
had
learned
the
necessity
of
sternness
from
her
previous
experience
with
princess
gertrude
for
that
lady
my
mother
a
fair
small
slim
woman
who
preserved
her
girlishness
of
appearance
till
the
approach
of
middle
age
was
of
a
strong
and
masterful
temper
only
krak
and
hammerfeldt
had
any
power
over
her
krak
seemed
the
result
of
ancient
domination
the
prince
was
won
by
a
suave
and
coaxing
deference
that
changed
once
a
year
or
thereabouts
to
stern
and
uncompromising
opposition
but
with
my
early
upbringing
and
with
victoria
hammerfeldt
had
nothing
to
do
my
mother
presided
and
krak
executed
the
spirit
of
styria
reigned
in
the
nursery
rather
than
the
softer
code
of
our
more
western
country
i
doubt
whether
discipline
were
stricter
in
any
house
in
forstadt
than
in
the
royal
palace
they
roused
me
at
eight
on
my
coronation
day
my
mother
herself
came
to
my
bedside
and
knelt
down
for
a
few
minutes
by
it
krak
stood
in
the
background
grim
and
gloomy
i
was
a
little
frightened
and
asked
what
was
afoot
you
to
be
crowned
augustin
said
my
mother
you
must
be
a
good
boy
am
i
to
be
crowned
king
mother
yes
dear
in
the
cathedral
will
you
be
a
good
king
i
be
a
great
king
mother
said
i
the
arabian
nights
were
still
in
my
head
she
laughed
and
rose
to
her
feet
have
him
ready
by
ten
baroness
she
said
i
must
go
and
have
my
coffee
and
then
dress
and
i
must
see
that
victoria
is
properly
dressed
too
are
you
going
to
be
crowned
mother
i
asked
no
she
said
i
shall
be
only
princess
heinrich
still
i
looked
at
her
with
curiosity
a
king
is
greater
than
a
princess
should
i
be
greater
than
my
mother
and
my
mother
was
greater
than
krak
why
then
but
krak
ended
my
musings
by
whisking
me
out
of
bed
it
was
fine
fun
to
ride
in
the
carriage
by
my
mother
side
with
victoria
and
old
hammerfeldt
opposite
hammerfeldt
was
president
of
the
council
of
regency
but
i
knowing
nothing
of
that
supposed
my
mother
had
asked
him
into
our
carriage
because
he
amused
us
and
gave
us
chocolates
my
mother
was
very
prettily
dressed
and
so
was
victoria
i
was
very
glad
that
krak
was
in
another
vehicle
there
were
crowds
of
people
in
the
street
cheering
us
more
than
they
ever
had
before
i
was
taking
off
my
hat
all
the
time
once
or
twice
i
held
up
my
sword
for
them
to
see
but
everybody
laughed
and
i
would
not
do
it
any
more
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
worn
a
sword
but
i
did
not
see
why
they
should
laugh
victoria
laughed
most
of
all
indeed
at
last
my
mother
scolded
her
saying
that
swords
were
proper
for
men
and
that
i
should
be
a
man
soon
we
reached
the
cathedral
and
with
my
hand
in
my
mother
i
was
led
up
the
nave
till
we
came
to
the
front
of
the
high
altar
there
was
a
very
long
service
i
did
not
care
about
or
heed
much
of
it
until
the
archbishop
came
down
on
to
the
lowest
step
and
my
mother
took
my
hand
again
and
led
me
to
him
and
he
put
the
crown
on
my
head
i
liked
that
and
turned
round
to
see
if
the
people
were
looking
and
was
just
going
to
laugh
at
victoria
when
i
saw
krak
frowning
at
me
so
i
turned
back
and
listened
to
the
archbishop
he
was
a
nice
old
man
but
i
did
not
understand
very
much
of
what
he
said
he
talked
about
my
uncle
my
father
and
the
country
and
what
a
king
ought
to
do
at
last
he
leaned
down
toward
me
and
told
me
in
a
low
but
very
distinct
voice
that
henceforward
god
was
the
only
power
above
me
and
i
had
no
lord
except
the
king
of
kings
he
was
a
very
old
man
with
white
hair
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
seemed
not
to
be
able
to
go
on
for
a
minute
perhaps
he
was
tired
or
did
not
know
what
to
say
next
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
they
had
taken
the
crown
off
because
it
was
so
heavy
for
me
and
said
in
a
whisper
poor
child
but
then
he
raised
his
voice
so
that
it
rang
all
through
the
cathedral
and
blessed
me
then
my
mother
made
me
get
up
and
turn
and
face
the
people
she
put
the
crown
on
my
head
again
then
she
knelt
and
kissed
my
hand
i
was
very
much
surprised
and
i
saw
victoria
trying
hard
not
to
laugh
because
krak
was
just
by
her
but
i
did
want
to
laugh
i
was
too
much
surprised
so
far
memory
carries
me
the
rest
is
blurred
until
i
found
myself
back
in
our
own
home
divested
of
my
military
costume
but
allowed
as
a
special
treat
to
have
my
sword
beside
me
when
we
sat
down
to
tea
we
had
many
good
things
for
tea
and
even
krak
was
thawed
into
amiability
she
told
me
that
i
had
behaved
very
well
in
the
cathedral
and
that
i
should
see
the
fireworks
from
the
window
presently
it
was
winter
and
soon
dark
the
fireworks
began
at
seven
i
remember
them
very
well
above
all
i
recollect
the
fine
excitement
of
seeing
my
own
name
in
great
long
golden
letters
with
a
word
after
them
that
krak
told
me
i
ought
to
know
meant
king
and
was
of
the
third
declension
said
krak
and
told
poor
victoria
to
go
on
victoria
was
far
too
excited
and
krak
said
we
must
both
learn
it
but
we
were
clapping
our
hands
and
did
pay
much
heed
then
hammerfeldt
came
in
and
held
me
up
at
the
window
for
a
few
minutes
telling
me
to
kiss
my
hand
to
the
people
i
did
as
he
told
me
then
the
crowd
began
to
go
away
and
krak
said
it
was
bedtime
now
here
i
might
conclude
the
story
of
my
coronation
day
but
an
episode
remains
trivial
and
ludicrous
enough
yet
most
firmly
embedded
in
my
memory
indeed
it
has
always
for
me
a
significance
quite
independent
of
its
obvious
import
it
seems
to
symbolize
the
truth
which
the
experience
of
all
my
life
has
taught
me
perhaps
i
throw
dignity
to
the
winds
in
recording
it
i
intend
to
do
the
like
all
through
what
i
write
for
to
my
thinking
when
dignity
comes
in
at
the
door
sincerity
flies
out
of
the
window
i
was
not
tired
after
the
day
or
i
was
too
excited
to
feel
tired
my
small
brain
was
agog
my
little
head
was
turned
amidst
all
that
i
did
not
understand
i
understood
enough
to
conceive
that
i
had
become
a
great
man
i
saw
victoria
led
off
to
bed
and
going
meekly
but
i
was
not
as
victoria
she
was
not
a
king
as
i
was
mother
had
not
knelt
before
her
the
archbishop
had
not
told
victoria
that
she
had
no
lord
except
the
king
of
kings
perhaps
i
was
hardly
to
blame
when
i
took
his
words
as
excluding
the
domination
of
women
of
krak
even
of
the
mother
who
had
knelt
and
kissed
my
hand
at
any
rate
i
was
in
a
wilful
mood
old
anna
the
nurse
had
put
victoria
to
bed
and
now
came
through
the
door
that
divided
our
rooms
and
proposed
to
assist
me
in
my
undressing
i
was
wilful
and
defiant
i
refused
most
flatly
to
go
to
bed
anna
was
perplexed
unquestionably
a
new
and
reverential
air
was
perceptible
in
anna
the
detection
of
it
was
fuel
to
my
fires
of
rebellion
anna
sent
for
krak
in
the
interval
before
the
governess
arrival
i
grew
uneasy
i
half
wished
i
had
gone
to
bed
quietly
but
now
i
was
in
for
the
battle
had
there
been
any
meaning
in
what
the
archbishop
said
or
had
there
not
was
it
true
or
had
he
misled
me
i
had
believed
him
and
was
minded
to
try
the
issue
i
sat
in
my
chair
attempting
to
whistle
as
my
groom
had
taught
me
krak
came
i
whistled
on
there
was
a
whispered
consultation
between
anna
and
krak
then
krak
told
me
that
i
was
to
go
to
bed
and
bade
me
begin
the
process
by
taking
off
my
shoes
i
looked
her
full
and
fair
in
the
face
i
wo
till
i
choose
said
i
i
king
now
and
then
i
quoted
to
krak
what
the
archbishop
had
said
she
lifted
her
hands
in
amazement
and
wrath
i
shall
have
to
fetch
your
mother
she
said
i
above
my
mother
she
knelt
to
me
i
retorted
triumphantly
krak
advanced
toward
me
augustin
take
off
your
shoes
said
she
i
had
no
love
for
krak
dearest
of
all
gifts
of
sovereignty
would
be
the
power
of
defying
krak
do
you
really
want
me
to
take
them
off
i
asked
this
instant
commanded
krak
i
do
not
justify
my
action
yet
perhaps
the
archbishop
should
have
been
more
careful
of
what
he
said
my
answer
to
krak
was
take
them
then
and
i
snatched
off
one
of
them
and
threw
it
at
krak
it
missed
most
narrowly
the
end
of
her
long
nose
and
lodged
harmlessly
enough
on
anna
broad
bosom
i
sat
there
exultant
fearful
and
defiant
krak
spoke
to
anna
in
a
low
whisper
then
they
both
went
out
leaving
me
alone
in
the
big
room
i
grew
afraid
partly
because
i
was
alone
partly
for
what
i
had
done
i
could
undress
myself
although
i
was
not
as
a
rule
allowed
to
i
tumbled
quickly
out
of
my
clothes
and
had
just
slipped
on
my
nightshirt
when
the
door
opened
and
my
mother
entered
followed
by
krak
my
mother
looked
very
young
and
pretty
but
she
also
looked
severe
is
this
true
augustin
she
asked
sitting
down
by
the
fire
yes
mother
said
i
arrested
in
my
flight
toward
bed
you
refused
to
obey
the
baroness
yes
i
king
now
and
threw
your
shoe
at
her
the
archbishop
said
i
began
be
quiet
said
my
mother
and
she
turned
her
head
and
listened
to
krak
who
began
to
whisper
in
her
ear
a
moment
later
she
turned
to
me
you
must
do
as
you
are
told
she
said
and
you
must
apologize
to
the
baroness
i
have
taken
them
off
if
she
had
asked
me
i
said
but
she
ordered
me
she
has
a
right
to
order
you
is
she
god
i
asked
pointing
scornfully
at
krak
really
the
archbishop
must
bear
some
of
the
responsibility
krak
whispered
again
again
my
mother
turned
to
me
will
you
apologize
augustin
she
said
no
said
i
stubbornly
krak
whispered
again
i
heard
my
mother
say
with
a
little
laugh
but
baroness
then
she
sighed
and
looked
round
at
me
do
apologize
augustin
said
she
i
apologize
to
you
not
to
her
i
said
she
looked
at
the
baroness
then
at
me
then
back
to
the
baroness
then
she
smiled
and
sighed
i
suppose
so
he
must
learn
it
but
not
much
baroness
just
enough
to
to
show
him
krak
came
toward
me
a
moment
later
i
occupied
a
position
which
to
my
lively
discomfort
i
had
filled
once
or
twice
before
in
my
short
life
but
which
i
had
not
supposed
that
i
should
fill
again
after
what
the
archbishop
had
said
i
set
my
teeth
to
endure
i
was
full
of
bewilderment
surprise
and
anger
the
archbishop
had
played
me
terribly
false
the
arabian
nights
were
no
less
delusive
krak
was
as
unmoved
and
as
usual
i
was
determined
not
to
cry
not
i
was
not
very
hard
tried
almost
directly
my
mother
said
that
will
do
there
was
a
pause
no
doubt
krak
face
expressed
a
surprised
protest
yes
that
enough
said
my
mother
and
she
added
get
into
bed
augustin
you
must
learn
to
be
an
obedient
boy
before
you
can
be
a
good
king
the
moment
i
was
released
i
ran
and
leaped
into
bed
hiding
my
face
under
the
clothes
i
heard
my
mother
come
and
say
wo
you
kiss
me
but
i
was
very
angry
i
did
not
understand
why
they
made
me
a
king
and
then
beat
me
because
i
behaved
like
all
the
kings
i
had
been
told
or
read
about
moreover
i
had
begun
to
cry
now
and
i
would
have
been
killed
sooner
than
let
krak
see
that
so
presently
my
mother
went
away
and
krak
too
then
anna
came
and
tried
to
turn
down
the
clothes
but
i
would
not
let
her
i
hung
on
to
them
hard
for
i
was
still
crying
i
heard
anna
sigh
poor
dearie
then
she
went
away
but
directly
after
victoria
voice
came
saying
anna
says
i
may
come
in
with
you
may
i
please
augustin
i
let
her
move
the
bedclothes
and
get
in
with
me
and
i
put
my
arms
round
her
neck
victoria
comforted
me
as
best
she
could
you
be
a
real
king
when
you
grow
up
she
said
a
thought
struck
me
a
rapturous
thought
born
of
the
arabian
nights
in
the
archbishop
lay
no
comfort
at
all
yes
i
cried
and
then
i
bastinado
krak
with
this
comforting
thought
i
fell
asleep
a
strange
day
this
of
my
coronation
odd
to
pass
through
to
the
highest
degree
illuminating
in
retrospect
i
did
not
live
to
bastinado
krak
nor
would
i
now
had
i
the
power
what
they
did
was
perhaps
a
little
cruel
a
little
styrian
as
victoria
and
i
used
covertly
to
say
of
such
harsh
measures
but
how
valuable
a
lesson
on
the
state
and
fortune
of
kings
the
king
is
one
the
man
another
the
king
is
crowned
the
man
is
lashed
they
give
us
greatness
in
words
in
fact
we
are
our
servants
servants
little
as
i
liked
the
thing
at
the
time
i
can
not
now
regret
that
i
was
chastised
on
my
coronation
day
i
was
thus
put
into
an
attitude
eminently
conducive
to
the
perception
of
truth
and
to
a
realization
of
the
facts
of
my
position
i
forgive
thee
the
blows
krak
lo
i
forgive
thee
chapter
ii
a
bird
without

a
man
are
to
himself
not
altogether
puerile
they
are
parcel
of
the
complex
explanation
of
his
existent
self
he
starts
i
suppose
as
something
a
very
malleable
something
ready
to
be
hammered
into
the
shape
that
the
socket
requires
the
two
greatest

work

the
yielding
substance
are
parents
and
position
with
the
boy
beneath
my
window
crusts
and
cuffs
with
me
at
the
window
kingship
and
styrian
discipline
in
the
latter
there
was
to
me
nothing
strange
i
had
grown
into
it
from
birth
but
now
it
became
suddenly
noticeable
as
a
thing
demanding
justification
by
reason
of
its
patent
incongruity
with
my
kingship
i
have
shown
how
swiftly
and
sharply
the
contrast
was
impressed
on
me
if
i
have
not
made
that
point
then
my
story
of
a
nursery
tragedy
is
unexcused
i
was
left
wondering
what
manner
of
king
he
was
who
must
obey
on
pain
of
blows
i
was
very
young
and
the
sense
of
outrage
did
not
last
but
the
puzzle
persisted
and
victoria
riper
philosophy
was
taxed
to
allay
it
waiting
seemed
the
only
thing
waiting
till
i
could
fling
my
shoes
at
whom
i
would
and
sit
on
my
throne
to
behold
the
bastinadoing
of
krak
my
mother
told
me
that
i
must
be
an
obedient
boy
first
well
and
good
but
then
why
make
me
a
king
now
in
truth
i
was
introduced
to
the
fictions
of
high
policy
a
king
without
power
seems
to
a
child
like
a
bird
without
wings
but
a
bird
without
wings
is
a
favourite
device
of
statesmanship
the
matter
did
not
stand
even
here
my
kingship
not
only
lacked
the
positive
advantages
with
which
youthful
imagination
aided
by
the
archbishop
pious
hyperbole
had
endowed
it
it
became
in
my
eyes
the
great
and
fertile
source
of
all
my
discomfort
the
parent
of
every
distasteful
obligation
the
ground
on
which
all
chosen
pleasures
were
refused
it
was
ever
kings
can
not
do
this
or
kings
must
do
that
and
the
this
was
always
sweet
the
that
repellent
in
krak
hands
monarchy
became
a
cross
between
a
treadmill
and
a
what
the
use
of
being
a
king
i
dared
once
to
cry
to
her
god
did
not
make
you
a
king
for
your
own
pleasure
returned
krak
solemnly
i
recollect
thinking
that
her
remark
must
certainly
be
true
yet
wondering
whether
god
quite
realized
how
tiresome
the
position
was
it
may
be
supposed
that
i
had
many
advantages
to
counterbalance
these
evils
that
pressed
so
hardly
on
me
i
do
not
recollect
being
conscious
of
them
even
my
occasional
parades
in
public
although
they
tickled
my
vanity
were
spoiled
for
me
by
the
feeling
that
nobody
would
look
at
me
with
admiration
envy
or
even
interest
if
he
knew
the
real
state
of
the
case
i
may
observe
that
this
reflection
has
not
vanished
with
infancy
but
still
is
apt
to
assail
me
of
course
i
was
well
fed
well
housed
and
well
though
firmly
treated
alas
what
we
have
not
is
more
to
us
than
all
we
possess
i
was
thankful
under
protest
prohibitions
outweighed
privileges
i
have
not
the
experience
necessary
for
any
generalization
but
my
own
childhood
was
not
very
happy
a
day
comes
into
my
mind
almost
as
clear
and
distinct
in
memory
as
my
coronation
day
i
was
nine
years
old
and
went
with
my
mother
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
nobleman
of
high
rank
he
had
just
married
and
brought
to
his
house
a
young
american
lady
we
were
welcomed
of
course
with
infinite
courtesy
and
deference
princess
heinrich
received
such
tributes
well
with
a
quiet
restrained
dignity
and
a
lofty
graciousness
i
was
smart
in
my
best
clothes
a
miniature
uniform
of
the
corps
of
guards
and
my
hand
flew
up
to
my
little
helmet
when
the
countess
curtseyed
very
low
and
looked
at
me
with
merry
sparkling
blue
eyes
her
husband
was
a
tall
fellow
stiff
in
back
and
manner
as
are
most
of
our
folk
but
honest
and
as
are
most
of
them
also
but
i
paid
little
heed
to
him
the
laughing
countess
engrossed
me
and
i
found
myself
smiling
at
her
her
eyes
seemed
to
enter
into
confidence
with
me
and
i
knew
she
was
rather
sorry
for
me
the
day
was
damp
and
chill
and
although
my
mother
would
not
refuse
to
go
round
the
count
gardens
of
which
he
was
proud
she
declared
that
the
walk
was
not
safe
for
me
and
asked
the
countess
to
take
care
of
me
so
she
and
i
were
left
alone
i
stood
rather
shyly
by
the
table
fingering
the
helmet
that
my
mother
had
told
me
to
take
off
presently
looking
up
i
saw
her
merry
eyes
on
me
sire
said
the
countess
if
you
sat
down
i
would
i
bowed
and
sought
a
chair
there
was
a
high
wooden
and
i
clambered
into
it
my
legs
dangled
in
another
little
laugh
came
from
the
countess
as
she
brought
me
a
high
footstool
i
tried
to
jump
down
in
time
to
stop
her
but
she
would
not
let
me
then
she
knelt
herself
on
the
stool
her
knees
by
my
feet
what
beautiful
military
boots
she
said
i
looked
down
listlessly
at
my
shining
toes
she
clasped
her
hands
crying
you
a
beautiful
little
king
oh
is
it
lovely
to
be
a
king
i
looked
at
her
doubtfully
her
pretty
face
was
quite
close
to
mine
somehow
i
wanted
very
much
to
put
my
arms
round
her
neck
but
i
felt
sure
that
kings
did
not
hug
countesses
imagine
krak
verdict
on
such
a
notion
i
not
a
king
for
my
own
pleasure
said
i
regarding
my
hostess
gravely
i
am
a
king
for
the
good
of
my
people
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
whispered
in
english
i
did
not
understand
then
but
the
sound
of
the
words
stayed
with
me
poor
little
mite
then
she
said
but
do
you
have
a
lovely
time
i
felt
that
i
was
becoming
rather
red
and
i
knew
that
the
tears
were
not
far
from
my
eyes
no
said
i
not
very
why
not
they
they
do
let
me
do
any
of
the
things
i
want
to
you
shall
do
anything
you
want
to
here
she
whispered
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
see
that
her
bright
eyes
had
grown
a
little
clouded
we
no
kings
in
my
country
she
said
taking
my
hand
in
hers
oh
i
wish
i
been
born
there
said
i
then
we
looked
at
one
another
for
a
minute
and
i
put
out
my
arms
and
took
hold
of
her
and
drew
her
face
near
mine
with
a
little
gulp
in
her
throat
she
sprang
up
caught
me
in
her
arms
kissed
me
a
dozen
times
and
threw
herself
into
the
big
chair
with
me
on
her
knees
now
i
was
crying
and
yet
half
laughing
so
i
believe
was
she
we
did
not
say
very
much
more
to
one
another
soon
i
stopped
crying
she
looked
at
me
and
we
both
laughed
what
babies
we
are
your
majesty
said
she
they
might
let
me
do
a
little
more
might
they
it
all
krak
you
know
mother
would
be
half
so
bad
without
krak
oh
my
dear
and
is
krak
so
horrid
horrid
said
i
with
grave
emphasis
the
countess
kissed
me
again
you
grow
up
soon
she
said
somehow
the
assurance
comforted
me
more
from
her
lips
than
from
victoria
will
you
be
nice
to
me
when
you
grow
up
i
shall
always
be
very
very
fond
of
you
said
i
she
laughed
a
funny
little
laugh
and
then
sighed
if
god
sends
me
a
little
son
i
hope
he
be
like
you
she
whispered
with
her
cheek
against
mine
he
wo
be
a
king
said
i
with
a
sigh
of
envy
you
poor
dear
cooed
she
then
came
my
mother
clear
voice
just
outside
the
door
descanting
on
the
beauty
of
the
count
parterres
and
orangery
a
swift
warning
glance
flew
from
me
to
my
hostess
i
scampered
off
my
perch
and
she
stood
up
in
respectful
readiness
for
the
entrance
of
princess
heinrich
do
tell
mother
i
whispered
urgently
not
a
word
whatever
they
do
to
you
no
whatever
they
do
to
me
my
mother
was
in
the
room
the
count
holding
the
door
for
her
and
closing
it
as
she
passed
through
i
felt
her
glance
rest
on
me
for
a
moment
then
she
turned
to
the
countess
and
expressed
all
proper
admiration
of
the
gardens
the
house
and
the
whole
demesne
and
i
hope
augustin
has
been
a
good
boy
she
ended
the
king
has
been
very
good
madame
returned
the
countess
then
she
looked
in
an
inquiring
way
at
her
husband
as
though
she
did
not
quite
know
whether
she
were
right
or
not
and
with
a
bright
blush
added
if
you
would
let
him
come
again
some
day
madame
my
mother
smiled
quite
graciously
you
must
leave
me
out
of
the
invitation
she
said
we
will
both
come
wo
we
augustin
yes
please
mother
said
i
relapsed
into
shyness
and
in
great
fear
lest
our
doings
should
be
discovered
say
now
commanded
the
princess
i
should
have
liked
to
kiss
the
countess
again
but
such
an
act
would
have
risked
a
betrayal
our
adieu
was
made
in
proper
form
the
countess
accompanying
us
to
the
door
there
we
left
her
curtseying
while
the
count
handed
my
mother
into
the
carriage
i
looked
round
and
the
countess
blew
me
a
surreptitious
kiss
when
we
had
driven
a
little
way
my
mother
said
do
you
like
the
countess
von
sempach
yes
very
much
she
was
kind
to
you
very
mother
then
why
have
you
been
crying
augustin
i
have
been
crying
said
i
the
lie
was
needful
to
my
compact
with
the
countess
my
honour
was
rooted
in
dishonour
yes
you
have
said
she
but
not
quite
in
the
accusing
tones
that
generally
marked
the
detection
of
falsehood
she
seemed
to
look
at
me
more
in
curiosity
than
in
anger
then
she
bent
down
toward
me
what
did
you
talk
about
she
asked
nothing
very
particular
mother
she
asked
me
if
i
liked
being
king
and
what
did
you
say
i
said
i
liked
it
pretty
well
my
mother
made
no
answer
i
stole
a
look
at
her
handsome
features
she
was
frowning
a
little
i
did
tell
her
much
said
i
aiming
at
propitiation
much
of
what
came
sharply
but
not
unkindly
yet
the
question
posed
me
oh
i
do
know
i
murmured
forlornly
and
i
was
surprised
when
she
turned
and
kissed
me
saying
we
all
love
you
augustin
but
you
have
to
be
king
and
you
must
learn
how
yes
i
assented
the
thing
was
quite
inevitable
i
knew
that
silence
followed
for
a
little
while
then
my
mother
said
when
you
ten
you
shall
have
a
tutor
and
your
own
servants
augustin
hastily
i
counted
the
months
there
were
nine
but
what
did
the
proposal
mean
was
i
to
be
a
free
man
then
and
we
women
will
leave
you
alone
my
mother
went
on
she
kissed
me
again
adding
you
do
like
us
do
you
i
like
you
mother
i
said
gravely
at
least
generally
not
when
you
let
kr
the
baroness
never
mind
the
baroness
she
interrupted
then
she
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
and
asked
me
in
a
very
low
voice
you
did
like
the
countess
better
than
me
did
you
augustin
n
no
mother
said
i
but
i
was
an
unaccomplished
hypocrite
and
my
mother
turned
away
my
thoughts
were
not
on
her
but
on
the
prospect
her
words
had
opened
to
me
do
you
mean
that
the
baroness
wo
be
my
governess
any
more
yes
you
have
a
governor
a
tutor
and
shall
i
i
tell
you
all
about
it
soon
dear
the
rest
of
our
drive
was
in
silence
my
mind
was
full
to
overflowing
of
impressions
hopes
and
wonders
my
mother
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
windows
of
the
carriage
we
reached
home
and
together
went
up
to
the
schoolroom
it
was
not
yet
and
were
on
the
table
krak
sat
beside
it
grave
grim
and
gray
victoria
was
opposite
to
her
victoria
was
crying
past
experience
enlightened
me
i
knew
exactly
what
had
happened
victoria
had
a
delightfully
unimpressionable
soul
no
rebuke
from
krak
brought
her
to
tears
krak
had
been
rapping
her
knuckles
and
her
tears
were
an
honest
tribute
to
pain
with
no
nonsense
of
merely
wounded
sensibility
about
them
my
mother
went
up
and
whispered
to
krak
krak
had
of
course
risen
and
stood
now
listening
with
a
heavy
frown
my
mother
drew
herself
up
proudly
she
seemed
to
brace
herself
for
an
effort
i
heard
nothing
except
i
think
you
should
consult
me
but
our
quick
children
eyes
apprehended
the
meaning
of
the
scene
krak
was
being
bearded
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
for
presently
krak
bowed
her
head
in
a
jerky
unwilling
nod
and
walked
out
of
the
room
my
mother
stood
still
for
a
moment
with
a
vivid
red
colour
in
her
cheeks
then
she
walked
across
to
victoria
lifted
one
of
her
hands
from
the
table
and
kissed
it
you
going
to
have
tea
with
me
children
said
she
and
we
play
games
afterward
augustin
shall
play
at
not
being
a
king
i
remember
well
the
tea
we
had
and
the
games
that
followed
wherein
we
all
played
at
being
what
we
were
not
and
for
an
evening
cheated
fate
of
its
dues
my
mother
was
merriest
for
over
victoria
and
myself
there
hung
a
veil
of
unreality
a
consciousness
that
indeed
we
played
and
set
aside
for
an
hour
only
the
obstinate
claims
of
the
actual
but
we
were
all
merry
and
when
we
parted
for
my
mother
had
a
we
both
kissed
her
heartily
me
she
kissed
often
i
thought
that
she
wanted
to
ask
me
again
whether
i
liked
the
countess
better
than
her
but
was
afraid
to
risk
the
question
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
i
liked
none
better
if
she
would
be
always
what
she
was
this
evening
but
i
found
no
skill
adequate
to
a
declaration
of
affection
so
conditional
it
would
be
to
make
a
market
of
my
kisses
and
i
had
not
yet
come
to
the
age
for
such
bargains
then
we
were
left
alone
victoria
and
i
to
sit
together
for
a
while
in
the
dusk
and
sitting
there
we
totted
up
that
day
gains
they
were
uncertain
yet
seemed
great
all
that
had
passed
i
told
victoria
save
what
in
loyalty
to
my
countess
i
might
not
victoria
imparted
to
me
the
story
of
the
for
her
an
added
joy
lay
in
the
fact
that
on
this
occasion
if
ever
she
had
deserved
the
affliction
she
had
been
gloriously
naughty
and
gloried
in
it
now
did
not
her
sinfulness
enhance
the
significance
of
this
revolution
so
carried
away
were
we
by
our
triumph
that
now
again
after
a
long
interval
we
allowed
our
imagination
to
paint
royalty
in
glowing
colours
and
our
arabian
nights
and
fairy
tales
seemed
at
last
not
altogether
cunningly
wrought
deceptions
when
we
had
gone
to
bed
again
we
met
i
creeping
into
her
room
and
rousing
her
to
ask
whether
in
truth
a
new
age
had
come
and
the
yoke
of
krak
been
broken
from
off
our
backs
victoria
sat
up
in
bed
and
discussed
the
problem
gravely
for
me
she
was
sanguine
for
herself
less
so
for
said
she
they
go
on
worrying
the
girls
for
ever
so
long
she
wo
rap
your
knuckles
any
more
i
suggested
fastening
on
a
certain
and
tangible
advantage
victoria
agreed
that
in
all
likelihood
her
knuckles
would
henceforth
be
inviolate
and
she
did
not
deny
such
gain
as
lay
there
thus
in
the
end
i
won
her
to
cheerfulness
and
we
parted
merrily
declaring
to
one
another
that
we
were
free
and
i
knew
that
in
some
way
the
pretty
american
countess
had
lent
a
hand
to
knocking
off
our
chains
free
a
wonderful
word
that
whether
you
use
it
of
a
child
a
man
a
state
a
world
an
universe
that
evening
we
seemed
free
in
i
received
from
old
hammerfeldt
a
great
statesman
as
history
will
one
day
allow
some
lectures
on
the
little
pregnant
powerful
empty
word
he
had
some
right
to
speak
of
freedom
he
had
seen
it
fought
for
by
napoleon
praised
by
talleyrand
bought
by
castlereagh
interpreted
by
metternich
should
he
not
then
know
what
it
was
its
value
its
potency
and
its
sweetness
why
men
died
for
it
and
delicate
women
who
loved
them
cheered
them
on
once
also
in
later
years
a
beautiful
woman
cried
to
me
with
white
arms
outstretched
that
to
be
free
was
life
was
all
in
all
the
heart
one
satisfaction
her
i
pressed
seeking
to
know
wherein
lay
the
attraction
and
allurement
that
fired
her
to
such
extravagance
and
i
told
her
what
the
prince
had
said
to
me
through
his
pinch
of
snuff
said
he
become
free
what
is
it
it
is
to
change
your
master
the
lady
let
her
arms
fall
to
her
side
reflected
a
moment
smiled
and
said
the
prince
was
no
fool
sire
as
the
result
of
this
day
that
i
have
described
i
had
become
free
i
had
changed
my
master
we
did
not
however
pay
any
more
visits
to
the
countess
chapter
iii
some
secret
opinions
even
such
results
as
might
be
looked
for
on
prince
von
theory
of
the
meaning
of
freedom
were
in
my
case
arrested
and
postponed
by
a
very
serious
illness
which
attacked
me
on
the
threshold
of
my
eleventh
year
we
had
gone
to
schloss
artenberg
according
to
our
custom
in
the
summer
it
was
krak
was
away
the
tutor
had
not
arrived
the
immediate
fruit
of
this
temporary
emancipation
was
that
i
got
my
feet
very
wet
with
dabbling
about
the
river
and
being
under
no
sterner
control
than
victoria
lingered
long
in
this
condition
next
day
i
was
kept
in
bed
and
victoria
was
in
sore
disgrace
to
be
brief
the
mischief
attacked
my
lungs
soon
i
was
seriously
ill
a
number
of
grave
gentlemen
came
and
went
about
the
bed
on
which
i
lay
for
several
weeks
of
this
time
i
have
many
curious
impressions
most
of
them
centre
round
my
mother
she
slept
in
my
room
and
i
believe
hardly
ever
left
me
i
used
to
wake
from
uneasy
sleep
and
look
across
to
her
bed
always
in
a
few
moments
she
also
awoke
came
and
gave
me
what
i
needed
or
asked
for
and
then
would
throw
a
round
her
and
walk
softly
to
and
fro
on
bare
feet
with
her
long
fair
hair
hanging
about
her
shoulders
her
face
looked
different
in
those
days
yet
it
was
not
soft
as
i
have
seen
faces
when
their
sons
lay
sick
or
dead
but
rather
excited
urgent
defiant
the
lips
were
set
close
and
the
eyes
gleamed
she
did
not
supplicate
god
she
fought
fate
or
if
god
and
fate
be
one
then
it
was
god
whom
she
fought
and
her
battle
was
untiring
i
knew
from
her
face
that
i
might
die
but
so
far
as
i
can
recall
my
mood
i
was
more
curious
about
the
effect
of
such
an
event
on
her
and
on
victoria
than
concerning
its
import
to
myself
i
asked
her
once
what
would
happen
if
i
died
would
victoria
be
queen
she
forbade
me
to
ask
the
question
but
i
pressed
it
and
she
answered
hastily
yes
yes
but
you
wo
die
augustin
you
sha
die
i
was
not
allowed
to
see
very
much
of
victoria
but
a
day
or
two
afterward
she
sat
with
me
alone
for
a
little
while
and
i
told
her
she
would
be
queen
if
i
died
no
mother
would
kill
me
she
said
with
absolute
conviction
in
no
resentment
or
fear
but
in
a
simple
certitude
why
because
you
did
bring
me
in
when
i
got
wet
yes
if
you
died
of
it
nodded
victoria
i
do
believe
it
i
said
boldly
why
should
she
like
you
to
be
queen
she
hate
it
said
victoria
she
does
hate
me
being
king
you
a
boy
i
wondered
dimly
then
and
i
have
wondered
since
hardly
with
more
knowledge
what
truth
or
whether
any
lay
behind
my
sister
words
she
believed
that
apart
from
any
unjust
blame
for
my
misfortune
her
mother
would
not
willingly
see
her
queen
yet
why
not
i
have
a
son
and
would
be
glad
to
lay
down
my
burden
and
kiss
his
hand
as
he
sat
on
the
throne
are
all
fathers
such
as
i
nay
and
are
all
mothers
such
as
mine
i
know
not
and
if
there
be
any
position
that
opens
a
man
mind
to
the
socratic
wisdom
of
knowing
his
own
ignorance
it
is
that
in
which
my
life
has
been
spent
but
it
can
hardly
be
that
the
curious
veiled
opposition
which
from
about
this
time
began
to
exist
between
my
mother
and
my
sister
was
altogether
singular
it
was
a
feeling
not
inconsistent
with
duty
with
punctilious
observance
not
even
with
love
but
there
was
in
it
a
sort
of
jealousy
of
assertion
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
became
older
to
have
roots
deeper
than
any
accidental
occurrence
or
environment
and
so
far
i
came
near
to
the
difficult
analysis
to
spring
from
the
relation
of
one
woman
who
was
slowly
but
surely
being
forced
to
lay
down
what
she
had
prized
most
in
her
womanhood
and
another
who
slowly
but
surely
also
became
aware
that
hers
was
the
prize
in
her
turn
and
thrust
forward
a
tentative
hand
to
grasp
it
if
i
am
at
all
right
in
this
notion
then
it
is
plain
that
feelings
slight
and
faint
although
not
in
ordinary
homes
might
be
intensified
in
such
a
family
as
ours
and
that
a
new
and
great
impulse
would
have
been
imparted
to
them
by
such
an
artificial
accentuation
of
the
inevitable
as
must
have
resulted
had
i
died
and
my
sister
been
called
to
the
first
place
among
men
the
cause
for
such
an
antagonism
is
far
less
powerful
advancing
years
take
less
from
us
and
often
bring
what
to
older
eyes
is
a
good
recompense
for
lost
youth
and
seems
to
youth
itself
more
precious
than
any
of
its
own
possessions
our
empire
never
so
brilliant
as
a
woman
in
its
prime
is
of
stuff
more
durable
and
less
shaken
by
the
wind
of
time
fluttering
garment
as
he
passes
by
my
confessor
came
to
see
me
sometimes
he
was
an
eminent
divine
nominated
to
his
post
by
hammerfeldt
in
reward
i
believe
for
some
political
usefulness
i
do
not
think
he
saw
far
into
a
child
heart
or
perhaps
i
was
not
like
most
children
he
was
always
comforting
me
telling
me
not
to
be
afraid
that
god
was
merciful
christ
full
of
love
and
the
saints
praying
for
me
now
i
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
i
was
very
curious
about
death
i
had
never
seen
it
but
i
was
as
i
have
said
more
curious
about
the
world
i
should
leave
behind
i
wanted
to
know
what
would
be
done
when
i
was
dead
and
where
i
was
to
be
buried
would
they
fire
the
guns
and
parade
the
troops
i
did
not
rise
to
the
conception
of
myself
not
knowing
anything
of
what
they
did
i
thought
i
should
be
there
somehow
looking
on
from
heaven
and
i
think
that
i
rather
enjoyed
the
prospect
a
child
is
very
i
had
no
doubt
that
i
should
be
the
object
of
much
attention
in
heaven
on
that
day
at
least
i
hinted
something
of
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
to
the
confessor
he
did
not
appear
to
follow
the
drift
of
my
thoughts
he
told
me
again
that
i
had
been
a
good
boy
and
that
now
if
i
prayed
and
was
sorry
for
my
faults
i
should
be
happy
and
should
please
god
this
did
not
touch
the
point
that
engaged
my
attention
i
tried
whether
my
mother
could
help
me
and
i
was
surprised
when
the
tears
started
into
her
eyes
and
she
bade
me
almost
roughly
to
be
quiet
however
when
victoria
came
we
talked
it
all
over
victoria
cried
a
little
but
she
was
quite
clear
as
to
her
own
position
in
the
procession
and
we
had
rather
an
animated
dispute
about
it
she
said
also
that
some
one
in
heaven
would
hold
me
and
we
differed
again
as
to
the
celestial
personage
in
whose
lap
i
was
to
sit
i
am
afraid
that
here
our
imaginations
were
assisted
by
the
picture
of
the
holy
family
in
the
chapel
of
the
schloss
not
the
least
tiresome
incident
of
this
time
was
that
krak
felt
it
her
duty
to
display
affection
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
krak
was
not
and
had
not
been
all
along
fond
of
me
but
in
ordinary
seasons
to
feel
affection
was
with
krak
no
reason
at
all
for
displaying
it
i
do
more
justice
to
krak
now
then
i
did
not
appreciate
the
change
in
her
demeanour
on
questioning
victoria
i
found
that
krak
softness
did
not
extend
beyond
the
limits
of
my
sickroom
she
had
indeed
ceased
the
but
in
its
place
she
curtailed
victoria
liberty
and
kept
her
nose
to
the
grindstone
pitilessly
why
should
caresses
be
confined
to
the
sick
and
kindness
be
bought
only
at
the
price
of
threatened
death
i
was
inclined
to
refuse
to
kiss
krak
but
my
mother
made
such
a
point
of
compliance
that
i
yielded
reluctantly
in
days
of
health
krak
had
exacted
morning
and
evening
a
formal
and
perfunctory
peck
if
i
gave
her
no
more
now
she
looked
aggrieved
and
my
mother
distressed
had
krak
been
possessed
by
a
real
penitence
i
would
have
opened
my
arms
to
her
but
i
was
fully
aware
that
her
mood
was
not
this
she
merely
wanted
to
know
that
i
bore
no
malice
for
just
discipline
and
it
went
to
my
heart
even
apparently
to
concede
this
position
there
seemed
to
me
something
a
little
unfair
in
her
proceedings
they
were
attempts
to
obtain
from
me
admissions
that
i
should
have
repudiated
scornfully
in
hours
of
health
i
knew
that
concessions
now
would
prejudice
my
future
liberty
in
days
to
come
supposing
i
recovered
my
hostility
to
krak
would
be
met
by
remember
how
kind
she
was
to
you
when
you
were
ill
or
oh
augustin
you
did
say
that
of
the
baroness
when
she
brought
you
grapes
in
your
illness
i
had
plenty
of
grapes
there
are
few
things
which
human
nature
resents
more
than
a
theft
of
its
grievances
i
was
polite
to
krak
but
i
lodged
a
protest
with
my
mother
and
confided
a
passionate
repudiation
of
any
treaty
to
sympathetic
ear
victoria
was
all
for
me
my
mother
was
stern
for
a
moment
and
then
smiling
faintly
told
me
to
try
to
sleep
after
several
months
i
took
a
decided
and
rapid
turn
toward
recovery
this
i
think
was
the
moment
in
which
i
realized
most
keenly
the
fictitious
importance
which
my
position
imparted
to
me
the
fashion
of
everybody
face
was
changed
mother
doctors
nurses
servants
all
wore
an
air
of
victory
when
i
was
carried
out
on
to
the
terrace
at
artenberg
rows
of
smiling
people
clapped
their
hands
i
felt
that
i
had
done
something
very
meritorious
in
getting
better
and
i
hoped
secretly
that
they
would
give
me
just
as
fine
a
procession
as
though
i
had
died
victoria
got
hold
of
a
newspaper
and
before
she
was
detected
and
silenced
read
me
a
sentence
by
the
favourable
news
of
the
king
health
a
great
weight
is
lifted
from
the
heart
of
the
country
there
is
not
a
house
that
will
not
be
glad
i
was
pleased
at
this
although
rather
surprised
taking
thought
with
myself
i
concluded
that
although
kingship
had
hitherto
failed
to
answer
my
private
expectations
and
desires
yet
it
must
be
a
more
important
thing
even
in
these
days
than
i
had
come
to
suppose
i
put
a
question
to
my
mother
pointing
at
one
of
the
gardeners
if
josef
son
was
ill
and
i
was
ill
said
i
which
would
josef
wish
most
to
get
better
the
king
should
be
before
a
thousand
sons
to
him
she
answered
quickly
and
in
a
proud
agitated
voice
but
a
moment
later
she
bade
me
not
ask
foolish
questions
i
remember
that
i
studied
her
face
for
some
moments
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
make
out
how
she
really
felt
about
me
and
my
kingship
convalescence
was
a
pleasant
season
styrian
discipline
was
relaxed
and
i
was
allowed
to
do
very
nearly
all
that
my
strength
enabled
me
victoria
shared
in
the
indulgence
of
this
time
i
remember
we
agreed
that
there
would
be
something
to
be
said
for
never
getting
quite
well
had
getting
quite
well
meant
going
back
to
krak
i
should
have
felt
this
point
of
view
most
strongly
but
i
was
not
to
go
back
to
krak
there
was
a
talk
of
a
governor
of
tutors
and
masters
hammerfeldt
came
down
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
my
mother
she
came
out
from
the
interview
with
flushed
cheeks
seeming
vexed
and
perturbed
but
she
was
composed
again
when
the
prince
took
his
leave
and
said
to
him
pleasantly
you
must
take
him
away
from
me
altogether
prince
we
rely
on
your
influence
above
everything
madame
was
courtly
answer
but
my
mother
watched
his
retreating
figure
with
a
rather
bitter
smile
then
she
turned
to
me
and
asked
shall
you
be
glad
to
have
tutors
krak
was
in
the
distance
with
victoria
my
mother
perceived
my
eyes
travelling
in
that
direction
poor
old
baroness
you
never
liked
her
did
you
augustin
no
said
i
emboldened
by
this
new
and
confidential
tone
try
to
think
more
kindly
of
her
she
advised
but
i
saw
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
aggrieved
at
my
want
of
appreciation
you
do
like
women
do
you
only
you
and
victoria
and
i
hesitated
and
anna
oh
of
course
old
anna
well
and
who
else
the
countess
von
sempach
said
i
a
little
timidly
have
you
forgotten
her
asked
my
mother
and
her
smile
became
less
bright
no
i
i
not
forgotten
her
i
murmured
does
she
ever
come
to
see
you
mother
here
at
artenberg
i
mean
no
darling
said
my
mother
i
did
not
pursue
the
subject
i
had
eyes
good
enough
to
see
that
my
dislike
for
krak
was
pleasanter
to
my
mother
than
my
liking
for
the
countess
women
seem
to
me
to
have
the
instinct
of
monopoly
and
not
to
care
for
a
share
of
affection
such
at
least
was
my
temperament
intensified
no
doubt
by
the
circumstance
that
in
future
days
my
favour
and
liking
might
be
matters
of
importance
she
feared
from
another
woman
just
what
she
feared
from
hammerfeldt
his
governor
and
his
tutors
probably
her
knowledge
of
the
world
made
her
dread
another
woman
more
than
any
number
of
men
she
feared
even
victoria
her
own
daughter
and
my
sister
but
a
woman
very
pretty
and
sympathetic
who
would
be
only
when
i
was
eighteen
must
have
seemed
to
her
mind
the
greatest
peril
of
all
it
is
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
conspicuous
place
that
a
man
likings
and
fancies
his
merest
whims
are
invested
by
others
with
an
importance
that
throws
its
reflection
back
on
to
his
own
mind
he
is
able
to
recollect
only
with
an
effort
that
even
in
his
case
there
are
a
good
many
things
of
no
importance
i
did
not
make
these
observations
as
a
small
boy
at
artenberg
but
even
as
a
small
boy
i
knew
very
well
that
the
countess
von
sempach
would
not
be
invited
to
the
schloss
nor
was
she
my
mother
guarded
the
gate
a
jealous
angel
thus
a
pleasant
summer
passed
at
artenberg
and
in
the
autumn
we
returned
to
forstadt
then
i
had
my
procession
though
it
seemed
scarcely
as
brilliant
or
interesting
as
that
wherein
victoria
had
held
first
place
while
i
looked
down
a
highly
satisfied
spectator
from
heaven
i
was
eleven
years
old
now
and
perhaps
just
the
first
bloom
was
wearing
off
the
wonder
of
the
world
for
recompense
but
not
in
full
requital
i
was
more
awake
to
the
meaning
of
things
around
me
and
i
fear
much
more
awake
to
the
importance
of
myself
augustin
now
i
appropriated
the
cheers
at
which
before
i
had
marvelled
and
approved
the
enthusiasm
that
had
before
amused
me
my
mother
greeted
these
signs
in
me
since
i
was
to
leave
the
women
she
would
now
have
me
a
man
as
soon
as
might
be
besides
she
had
a
woman
natural
impatience
for
my
full
growth
they
love
us
most
as
babies
when
they
are
providence
to
us
least
as
boys
when
we
make
light
of
them
more
again
when
as
men
we
return
to
rule
and
be
ruled
bartering
slavery
in
one
matter
for
dominion
in
another
and
working
out
the
equilibrium
of
power
but
after
my
procession
in
the
cathedral
when
i
was
giving
thanks
for
rescue
from
a
death
that
had
never
been
terrible
and
now
seemed
remote
and
impossible
i
saw
my
countess
she
was
nearly
opposite
to
me
her
husband
was
not
with
her
he
was
on
guard
in
the
nave
with
his
regiment
i
wanted
to
make
some
sign
to
her
but
i
had
been
told
that
everybody
would
be
looking
at
me
when
i
was
crowned
everybody
had
meant
krak
and
i
had
feared
no
other
eye
i
was
more
now
i
was
particularly
alert
that
my
mother
should
observe
nothing
but
the
countess
and
i
exchanged
a
glance
she
nodded
cautiously
almost
immediately
afterward
i
saw
her
wipe
her
eyes
i
should
have
liked
to
talk
to
her
tell
her
that
i
liked
being
a
king
rather
better
and
give
her
the
glad
tidings
that
the
dominion
of
krak
had
ended
but
i
got
no
chance
of
doing
anything
of
the
sort
being
carried
away
without
coming
nearer
to
her
victoria
was
in
very
low
spirits
that
evening
it
had
suddenly
come
upon
her
that
she
was
to
be
left
to
endure
krak
all
alone
victoria
and
i
were
not
somehow
as
closely
knit
together
as
we
had
been
she
was
now
thirteen
growing
a
tall
girl
and
i
was
but
a
little
boy
yet
our
relations
were
not
i
imagine
quite
what
they
would
have
been
between
brother
and
sister
of
such
relative
ages
in
an
ordinary
case
the
authority
which
elder
sisters
may
be
seen
so
readily
to
ape
and
assume
was
never
claimed
by
victoria
my
mother
would
not
have
endured
such
presumption
for
a
moment
i
think
victoria
regarded
me
as
a
singularly
ignorant
person
who
yet
by
fortune
freak
was
invested
with
a
strange
importance
and
the
prospect
at
least
of
great
and
indefinite
power
she
therefore
took
a
good
deal
of
pains
to
make
me
understand
her
point
of
view
and
to
convert
me
to
her
opinions
her
present
argument
was
that
she
also
ought
to
be
relieved
from
krak
krak
was
mother
governess
till
mother
was
eighteen
i
reminded
her
awful
groaned
poor
victoria
in
fact
mother
never
got
rid
of
krak
at
all
oh
that
different
i
should
in
the
least
mind
keeping
krak
as
my
daughter
governess
said
victoria
that
would
be
rather
fun
it
would
be
very
cruel
considering
what
krak
does
i
objected
dim
hintings
of
the
state
were
in
victoria
she
looked
a
little
doubtful
it
would
matter
when
she
was
quite
young
she
concluded
but
nearly
fourteen
augustin
will
you
ask
mother
to
send
krak
away
when
i
fifteen
no
said
i
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
straining
the
prerogative
then
when
i
sixteen
i
do
see
what
i
got
to
do
with
it
said
i
restlessly
victoria
became
huffy
you
king
and
you
could
do
it
if
you
liked
she
said
if
i
was
king
i
should
like
to
do
things
for
people
for
my
sister
anyhow
she
pouted
in
much
vexation
well
perhaps
i
try
some
day
said
i
reluctantly
oh
you
dear
boy
cried
victoria
and
she
immediately
gave
me
three
kisses
i
was
certainly
on
my
way
to
learn
the
secret
of
popularity
in
my
experience
victoria
conception
of
the
kingly
office
is
a
very
common
one
and
victoria
conduct
in
view
of
a
refusal
to
forward
her
views
and
of
consent
extremely
typical
for
victoria
took
no
account
of
my
labours
or
of
the
probable
trouble
i
should
undergo
or
of
the
snub
i
should
incur
she
called
me
a
dear
boy
gave
me
three
kisses
and
went
off
to
bed
in
much
better
spirits
and
all
the
while
my
own
secret
opinion
was
that
krak
was
rather
good
for
victoria
it
has
generally
been
my
secret
opinion
that
people
had
no
business
to
receive
the
things
which
they
have
asked
me
to
give
to
or
procure
for
them
when
the
merits
are
good
the
king
help
is
unnecessary
chapter
iv
two
of
my
makers
physically
my
parents
child
with
my
father
tall
stature
and
my
mother
features
intellectually
i
was
more
son
to
hammerfeldt
than
to
any
one
else
from
the
day
when
my
brain
began
to
develop
his
was
the
preponderating
influence
i
had
a
governor
a
good
soldier
general
von
vohrenlorf
i
had
masters
i
had
one
tutor
of
whom
more
presently
he
for
a
time
bade
fair
to
dispute
the
supremacy
but
above
them
all
moulding
me
and
controlling
them
was
this
remarkable
old
man
at
this
time
he
was
seventy
years
old
he
had
been
a
soldier
till
thirty
since
then
a
diplomatist
and
politician
i
do
not
think
in
all
things
as
hammerfeldt
thought
time
moves
and
each
man
mind
has
its
own
cast
but
i
will
make
no
claim
to
originality
at
the
cost
of
depreciating
what
i
learned
from
him
he
was
a
solitary
man
once
he
had
taken
a
wife
she
left
him
after
two
years
he
used
to
talk
about
her
as
though
she
had
died
at
the
date
when
she
ran
away
without
bitterness
with
an
indulgent
kindness
with
a
full
recognition
of
her
many
merits
those
who
did
not
know
the
story
little
supposed
that
the
lady
lived
still
in
paris
his
conduct
in
this
matter
was
highly
characteristic
he
regarded
passions
and
emotions
as
things
altogether
outside
and
independent
of
the
rational
man
their
power
could
not
be
denied
in
their
own
sphere
and
season
he
admitted
that
they
must
be
felt
raw
feeling
was
their
province
he
denied
that
they
should
affect
thought
or
dominate
action
in
others
they
were
his
opportunity
in
himself
a
luxury
that
had
never
been
dangerous
or
an
ailment
that
was
troublesome
but
never
fatal
he
was
hard
on
a
blunder
as
a
necessary
presupposition
to
effective
negotiation
or
business
he
recognised
a
binding
code
of
honour
he
has
frequently
told
me
he
did
not
understand
the
theological
conception
of
sin
he
had
eaten
of
our
salt
and
was
our
servant
thus
he
would
readily
have
died
for
us
but
he
prayed
pardon
if
we
asked
him
to
believe
in
us
conduct
he
said
once
is
the
outcome
of
selfishness
limited
by
it
was
his
way
so
to
put
things
as
to
strip
them
of
friendly
decent
covering
had
he
said
limited
by
the
axiom
would
have
been
more
accepted
and
less
quoted
a
superficial
person
used
to
exclaim
to
me
and
yet
he
is
so
kind
a
man
without
ideals
finds
kindness
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
in
truth
he
was
kind
and
in
a
confidential
sort
of
way
that
seemed
to
chuckle
and
wink
saying
we
rogues
together
then
i
must
lend
you
a
hand
but
he
could
be
ruthless
also
displaying
a
curious
aloofness
from
his
and
an
unconsciousness
of
any
suffering
he
might
inflict
that
left
mere
cruelty
far
behind
if
i
were
making
an
automaton
king
i
would
model
my
machine
on
the
lines
of
hammerfeldt
he
had
no
belief
in
a
future
life
but
would
sometimes
trifle
whimsically
with
the
theory
of
a
transmigration
of
souls
he
traced
all
beliefs
in
immortality
to
the
longing
of
those
who
were
unfortunate
here
and
who
did
not
think
himself
so
for
a
recompense
a
revenge
he
called
it
hereafter
and
declared
transmigration
to
be
at
once
the
most
ingenious
and
the
most
picturesque
embodiment
of
this
yearning
he
played
billiards
extremely
well
and
excused
his
skill
on
the
ground
that
he
was
compelled
to
pass
the
time
while
foreign
diplomatists
and
his
own
colleagues
were
making
up
their
mind
i
do
not
think
that
he
ever
hesitated
as
to
what
he
had
best
do
he
was
of
an
extremely
placid
and
happy
temper
as
may
be
anticipated
from
what
i
have
said
he
regarded
no
man
as
utterly
lost
unless
he
were
completely
under
the
influence
of
a
woman
yet
it
was
by
hammerfeldt
will
that
geoffrey
owen
became
my
daily
companion
and
familiar
friend
vohrenlorf
visited
me
once
or
twice
a
week
and
exercised
a
perfunctory
superintendence
i
had
of
course
many
masters
who
came
and
went
at
appointed
hours
owen
lived
with
me
both
at
forstadt
and
at
artenberg
at
this
time
he
was
he
excelled
my
own
adult
stature
and
walked
with
the
free
grace
of
a
english
gentleman
his
dark
hair
grew
thick
rising
from
his
forehead
in
a
wave
his
face
was
long
and
thin
and
a
slight
mustache
veiled
a
humorous
tender
mouth
there
was
about
the
man
a
pervading
sympathy
the
desire
to
be
friends
was
the
first
characteristic
of
his
manner
he
was
talkative
eager
enthusiastic
if
a
man
were
good
it
seemed
to
owen
but
natural
if
he
were
a
rogue
my
tutor
would
set
it
down
to
anything
in
the
world
save
his
own
fault
everybody
could
be
mended
if
everybody
else
would
try
thus
he
brought
with
him
into
our
conservative
military
court
and
society
the
latest
breath
of
generous
hope
and
human
aspiration
that
had
blown
over
oxford
surely
this
was
a
strange
choice
of
hammerfeldt
was
it
made
in
ignorance
of
the
man
or
with
some
idea
that
my
mind
should
be
opened
to
every
variety
of
thought
or
in
a
careless
confidence
that
his
own
influence
was
beyond
shaking
and
that
owen
spirit
would
beat
hopelessly
against
the
cage
and
never
reach
mine
in
its
prison
of
tradition
a
boy
that
would
not
have
worshipped
such
a
man
as
geoffrey
owen
must
have
wanted
heart
and
fire
i
watched
him
first
to
see
if
he
could
ride
he
rode
well
when
he
came
he
could
not
fence
in
six
months
he
was
a
good
hand
with
the
foils
physical
fatigue
seemed
as
unknown
to
him
as
mental
inertia
there
was
no
strain
and
no
cant
about
him
he
smoked
hard
drank
well
after
exertion
with
pleasure
always
he
delighted
to
talk
to
my
mother
chaffing
her
styrian
ideas
with
a
graceful
deference
that
made
her
smile
victoria
adored
him
openly
and
krak
did
not
understand
why
he
was
not
odious
thus
he
conquered
the
court
and
i
was
the
first
of
his
slaves
it
would
be
tedious
to
anybody
except
myself
to
trace
the
gradual
progress
of
our
four
years
intimacy
and
friendship
of
my
four
years
training
and
enlightenment
shall
i
summarize
it
and
say
that
owen
taught
me
that
there
were
folks
outside
palaces
and
that
the
greatness
of
a
station
even
as
of
a
man
stood
not
in
the
multitude
of
the
things
that
it
possessed
the
summary
is
cold
and
colourless
it
smacks
of
duty
of
obligations
unwillingly
remembered
of
selfish
pleasures
reluctantly
foregone
as
i
became
old
enough
to
do
more
than
listen
entranced
to
his
stories
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
be
such
a
man
as
he
was
and
not
knowing
that
he
himself
was
admired
could
be
no
duty
but
only
a
happy
dream
there
has
been
in
my
family
here
and
there
a
vein
of
fancy
or
of
mysticism
turning
sometimes
to
religious
fervour
again
sometimes
to
soldierly
enthusiasm
and
a
in
arms
the
ruin
and
despair
of
cool
statesmanship
on
this
element
owen
teaching
laid
hold
and
bent
it
to
a
more
modern
shape
i
would
not
be
a
monk
or
a
bayard
but
would
serve
humanity
holding
my
throne
a
naked
trust
whence
all
but
i
might
reap
benefit
whereon
i
must
sit
burdened
with
the
sorrows
of
all
and
thus
to
be
burdened
was
my
joy
with
some
boys
no
example
could
have
made
such
ideas
acceptable
or
won
anything
but
scornful
wonder
for
them
in
me
they
struck
answering
chords
and
as
i
rambled
in
the
woods
at
artenberg
already
in
my
mind
i
was
the
perfect
king
where
would
such
a
mood
have
led
where
would
it
have
ended
what
at
the
last
would
have
been
my
state
and
fame
on
my
fifteenth
birthday
prince
von
hammerfeldt
now
in
his
year
came
from
forstadt
to
artenberg
to
offer
me
congratulations
though
a
boy
may
have
such
thoughts
as
i
have
tried
to
describe
for
the
most
part
he
would
be
flogged
to
death
sooner
than
utter
them
to
the
prince
above
all
men
an
instinct
bade
me
be
silent
but
owen
rose
steadily
to
the
old
man
skilful
fly
he
did
not
lecture
the
minister
nor
preach
to
him
but
answered
his
questions
simply
and
from
the
heart
without
show
and
without
disguise
old
face
grew
into
a
network
of
amused
and
tolerant
wrinkles
my
dear
owen
said
he
i
heard
all
this
forty
fifty
years
ago
is
it
not
that
jean
jacques
has
crossed
the
channel
turning
more
sickly
on
the
way
owen
smiled
mine
was
the
face
that
grew
red
in
resentment
mine
the
tongue
that
burned
to
answer
him
i
know
what
you
mean
sir
laughed
owen
still
does
the
world
go
forward
i
see
no
signs
of
it
replied
hammerfeldt
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
unless
it
be
progress
to
teach
rogues
who
are
worth
a
snap
to
prate
of
their
worth
well
it
is
pretty
enough
in
you
to
think
as
you
think
what
says
the
king
to
it
he
turned
to
me
with
a
courteous
smile
but
with
an
unceremoniously
intent
gaze
in
his
eyes
i
had
no
answer
ready
i
was
still
excited
i
have
tried
to
interest
the
king
in
these
lines
of
thought
said
owen
ah
yes
very
proper
assented
hammerfeldt
his
eyes
still
set
on
my
face
we
must
have
more
talk
about
the
matter
princess
heinrich
awaits
me
now
owen
and
i
were
left
together
he
was
smiling
but
rather
sadly
yet
he
laughed
outright
when
i
carried
beyond
boyish
shame
by
my
indignation
broke
into
a
tirade
and
threw
back
at
him
something
of
what
he
had
taught
me
suddenly
he
interrupted
me
let
go
for
a
row
on
the
river
and
have
one
pleasant
afternoon
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
the
prince
does
not
want
us
any
more
the
afternoon
dwells
in
my
memory
in
my
belief
owen
quick
mind
had
read
something
of
the
prince
purpose
for
he
was
more
demonstrative
of
affection
than
was
his
wont
he
seemed
to
eye
me
with
a
pitiful
love
that
puzzled
me
and
he
began
to
talk
this
also
was
rare
with
him
of
my
special
position
how
i
must
be
apart
from
other
men
and
to
speculate
in
seeming
idleness
on
what
a
place
such
as
mine
would
be
to
him
and
make
of
him
all
this
came
between
our
spurts
of
rowing
or
among
our
talk
of
sport
or
of
flowers
as
we
lay
at
rest
under
the
bank
if
there
were
two
kings
here
as
there
were
in
sparta
i
cried
longingly
there
were
ephors
too
he
reminded
me
and
we
laughed
hammerfeldt
was
our
ephor
there
was
a
banquet
that
night
i
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
my
mother
opposite
and
hammerfeldt
at
her
right
hand
the
prince
gave
my
health
after
dinner
and
passed
on
to
a
warm
and
eloquent
eulogy
on
those
who
had
trained
me
in
the
course
of
it
he
dwelt
pointedly
on
the
obligation
under
which
geoffrey
owen
had
laid
me
and
of
the
debt
all
the
nation
owed
to
one
who
had
inspired
its
king
with
a
liberal
culture
and
a
zeal
for
humanity
i
could
have
clapped
my
hands
in
delight
i
looked
at
owen
who
sat
far
down
the
table
his
gaze
was
on
hammerfeldt
and
his
lips
were
parted
in
a
smile
i
did
not
understand
his
smile
but
it
persisted
all
through
the
prince
graceful
testimony
to
his
services
it
was
not
like
him
to
smile
with
that
touch
of
satire
when
he
was
praised
but
i
saw
him
only
for
an
instant
before
i
went
to
bed
and
others
were
with
us
so
that
i
could
ask
no
explanation
the
next
morning
i
rose
early
and
in
glee
for
i
was
to
go
hunting
owen
did
not
accompany
me
he
was
i
understood
to
confer
with
hammerfeldt
my
jovial
governor
vohrenlorf
had
charge
of
me
a
merry
day
we
had
and
good
sport
it
was
late
when
we
came
home
and
my
anxious
mother
awaited
me
in
the
hall
with
dry
slippers
she
had
a
meal
spread
for
me
and
herself
came
to
share
it
never
had
i
seen
her
so
tender
or
so
gentle
i
had
a
splendid
hunger
and
fell
to
babbling
of
my
skill
with
the
gun
between
hearty
mouthfuls
i
wish
owen
had
been
there
i
said
my
mother
nodded
but
made
no
answer
is
the
prince
gone
i
asked
no
he
is
here
still
he
stayed
in
case
you
should
want
to
see
him
augustin
i
do
want
him
said
i
with
a
laugh
as
i
pushed
my
chair
back
but
i
was
glad
he
talked
like
that
about
owen
last
night
i
think
i
go
and
see
if
owen
in
his
room
i
rose
and
started
toward
the
door
augustin
owen
is
not
in
his
room
said
my
mother
in
a
strangely
timid
voice
i
turned
with
a
start
for
i
was
sensitive
to
every
change
of
tone
in
her
voice
do
you
know
where
he
is
i
asked
he
is
gone
said
she
i
did
not
ask
where
nor
whether
he
would
return
i
sat
down
and
looked
at
her
she
came
smoothed
my
hair
back
from
my
forehead
and
kissed
me
i
have
not
sent
him
away
she
said
i
could
help
it
the
prince
was
resolved
and
he
has
power
but
why
burst
from
my
lips
it
is
the
prince
doing
not
mine
she
reminded
me
the
prince
is
here
augustin
why
yes
at
least
old
hammerfeldt
would
not
run
away
my
lips
were
quivering
i
was
nearer
tears
than
pride
had
let
me
be
for
three
years
past
grief
and
anger
uniting
to
make
me
sore
and
desolate
there
seemed
a
great
gap
made
in
my
life
my
dearest
companion
was
gone
the
source
of
all
that
most
held
my
fancy
and
filled
my
mind
dried
up
but
before
i
could
speak
again
a
tall
lean
figure
stood
in
the
doorway
helmet
in
hand
hammerfeldt
was
there
he
was
asking
if
the
king
would
receive
him
my
mother
turned
an
inquiring
glance
on
me
i
bowed
my
head
and
choked
down
a
sob
that
was
in
my
throat
the
old
man
came
near
to
me
and
stood
before
me
there
was
a
little
smile
on
his
lips
but
his
old
eyes
were
soft
sire
said
he
addressing
me
with
ceremonial
deference
and
formality
her
royal
highness
has
told
you
what
i
have
done
in
your
service
i
should
be
happy
in
your
majesty
approval
i
made
him
no
answer
a
king
sire
he
went
on
should
sip
at
all
cups
and
drain
none
know
all
theories
and
embrace
none
learn
from
all
men
and
be
bound
to
none
he
may
be
a
pupil
but
not
a
disciple
a
hearer
but
always
a
critic
a
friend
never
a
devotee
i
felt
my
mother
hand
resting
on
my
shoulder
i
sat
still
looking
in
the
prince
eyes
owen
has
done
his
work
well
he
went
on
but
his
work
is
done
do
you
ask
sire
why
he
is
gone
i
will
give
you
an
answer
i
prince
von
hammerfeldt
would
have
augustin
and
not
geoffrey
for
my
master
and
my
country
enough
for
prince
leave
him
now
my
mother
urged
in
a
whisper
the
prince
bent
his
head
slightly
but
remained
where
he
stood
for
a
moment
longer
then
he
bowed
very
low
to
me
and
drew
back
a
step
still
facing
me
my
mother
prompted
me
with
what
i
suppose
was
the
proper
formula
you
are
convinced
of
the
prince
wisdom
and
devotion
in
everything
are
you
augustin
she
said
yes
said
i
will
owen
write
to
me
when
your
majesty
is
older
your
majesty
will
of
course
use
your
own
pleasure
as
to
your
correspondence
returned
hammerfeldt
he
waited
for
a
moment
longer
and
then
drew
back
further
to
the
door
speak
to
the
prince
augustin
said
my
mother
i
am
very
grateful
to
the
prince
for
his
care
of
me
said
hammerfeldt
came
quickly
up
to
me
and
kissed
my
hand
i
would
make
you
a
true
king
sire
said
he
and
with
that
he
left
us
illustration
hammerfeldt
came
to
me
and
kissed
my
hand
so
they
took
my
friend
from
me
and
not
all
the
kindness
with
which
i
was
loaded
in
the
time
following
his
loss
lightened
the
grief
of
it
presently
i
came
to
understand
better
the
meaning
of
these
things
and
to
see
that
the
king
might
have
no
friend
for
his
friend
must
be
an
enemy
to
others
perhaps
even
to
the
king
himself
shall
i
now
blame
hammerfeldt
i
do
not
know
i
was
coming
to
the
age
when
impressions
sink
deep
into
the
mind
and
geoffrey
owen
was
a
man
whose
mark
struck
very
deep
besides
he
had
those
theories
it
was
not
strange
in
hammerfeldt
to
fear
those
theories
perhaps
he
was
right
with
his
statecraft
it
may
well
be
that
he
could
have
done
no
other
than
what
he
did
but
to
my
thoughts
these
reflections
were
not
present
they
had
taken
my
friend
from
me
in
my
bed
that
night
i
wept
for
him
and
my
days
seemed
empty
for
the
want
of
him
it
was
to
me
as
though
he
had
died
and
worse
than
that
there
are
things
as
final
as
death
yet
lacking
death
gentleness
such
is
it
to
be
cut
off
living
friend
from
living
friend
and
living
heart
from
heart
not
grown
cold
in
the
grave
i
have
told
this
story
of
my
tutor
and
myself
first
for
the
influence
owen
had
on
me
more
than
for
the
effect
wrought
in
me
by
the
manner
in
which
i
lost
him
there
must
be
none
very
near
me
it
seemed
as
though
that
stern
verdict
had
been
passed
there
must
be
a
vacant
space
about
the
throne
such
was
hammerfeldt
gospel
he
knew
that
he
himself
soon
must
leave
me
he
would
have
no
successor
in
power
and
none
to
take
a
place
in
love
that
he
had
neither
filled
nor
suffered
to
be
filled
as
i
wandered
alone
now
about
the
woods
at
artenberg
i
mused
on
these
things
and
came
to
a
conclusion
rather
bitter
for
one
of
my
years
i
would
tie
no
more
bonds
to
have
them
cut
with
the
sword
if
love
must
be
slain
love
should
be
born
no
more
to
begin
was
but
to
prepare
a
sad
ending
i
would
not
be
drawn
on
to
confidence
or
friendship
i
chose
not
to
have
rather
than
to
lose
not
to
taste
rather
than
leave
undrained
the
cup
of
sweet
intimacy
thus
i
armed
my
boyhood
at
once
against
grief
and
love
in
all
that
i
did
in
after
days
this
determination
was
always
with
me
often
overborne
for
the
time
by
emotions
and
passions
but
always
ready
to
reassert
itself
in
the
first
calm
hour
and
relentlessly
to
fetter
me
in
a
prison
of
my
own
making
my
god
how
i
have
longed
for
friends
sometimes
geoffrey
owen
i
saw
but
once
again
i
had
written
twice
to
him
and
received
respectful
friendly
brief
answers
but
the
sword
had
passed
through
his
heart
also
he
did
not
respond
to
my
invitation
nor
show
a
desire
to
renew
our
intimacy
perhaps
he
was
afraid
to
run
the
risk
in
truth
even
while
i
urged
him
i
was
half
afraid
myself
had
he
come
again
it
would
not
have
been
as
it
had
been
between
us
very
likely
we
both
in
our
hearts
preferred
to
rest
in
memories
not
to
spoil
our
thoughts
by
disappointment
to
be
always
to
one
another
just
what
we
had
been
as
we
rowed
together
that
last
afternoon
at
artenberg
when
the
dim
shadow
of
parting
did
no
more
than
deepen
our
affection
and
touch
it
to
a
profounder
tenderness
and
that
time
when
i
saw
him
again
i
was
driving
through
the
gates
of
an
english
palace
encircled
by
a
brilliant
troop
of
soldiers
cheered
by
an
interested
throng
far
back
in
their
ranks
but
standing
out
above
all
heads
i
saw
his
face
paler
and
thinner
more
gentle
even
and
kindly
he
wore
a
soft
hat
crushed
over
his
forehead
as
i
passed
he
lifted
and
waved
it
smiling
his
old
smile
at
me
i
waved
my
hand
leaning
forward
eagerly
but
i
could
not
stop
the
procession
as
soon
as
i
was
within
i
sent
an
equerry
to
seek
him
armed
with
a
description
that
he
could
not
mistake
but
geoffrey
owen
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
not
awaited
my
messenger
having
signalled
a
greeting
across
the
gulf
between
us
he
was
gone
i
could
have
found
him
for
i
knew
that
he
dwelt
in
london
working
writing
awakening
hope
in
many
fear
in
some
thought
in
all
but
i
would
not
seek
him
out
nor
compel
him
to
come
to
me
since
he
would
not
of
his
own
accord
so
he
went
his
way
i
mine
and
i
have
seen
him
no
more
yet
ever
on
my
birthday
i
drain
a
cup
to
him
and
none
knows
to
whom
the
king
drinks
a
full
glass
silently
it
is
my
libation
on
a
friendship
grave
perhaps
it
would
support
an
interpretation
more
subtle
for
when
i
stood
between
owen
and
hammerfeldt
torn
this
way
and
that
uncertain
whom
i
should
follow
through
life
was
not
i
the
humble
transitory
theatre
of
a
great
and
secular
struggle
it
seems
to
me
that
then
the
ideal
and
the
actual
joined
in
battle
over
me
hector
and
achilles
and
i
the
body
of
patroclus
alas
poor
body
greatly
the
combatants
desire
it
little
they
reck
of
the
roughness
it
suffers
in
their
struggle
the
spirit
and
the
world
am
i
if
i
seem
to
see
them
incarnated
in
geoffrey
owen
and
old
hammerfeldt
and
victory
was
with
the
world
yet
the
conquered
also
have
before
now
left
their
mark
on
lands
which
they
could
not
hold
chapter
something
about
victoria
i
feel
that
i
give
involuntarily
a
darker
colour
to
my
life
than
the
truth
warrants
when
we
sit
down
and
reflect
we
are
apt
to
become
the
prey
of
a
curious
delusion
pain
seems
to
us
the
only
reality
pleasure
a
phantasm
or
a
dream
yet
such
reality
as
pain
has
pleasure
shares
and
we
are
in
no
closer
touch
with
eternal
truth
when
we
have
headaches
or
heartaches
than
when
we
are
free
from
these
afflictions
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
a
false
idea
of
dignity
does
not
mislead
us
would
we
all
pose
as
martyrs
it
is
nonsense
for
most
of
us
life
is
a
tolerable
enough
business
if
we
would
not
think
too
much
about
it
we
need
not
pride
ourselves
on
our
griefs
it
seems
as
though
joy
were
the
higher
state
because
it
is
the
less
and
rests
in
fuller
harmony
with
the
great
order
that
encircles
us
as
i
grew
older
i
gained
a
new
and
abiding
source
of
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
and
study
of
my
sister
victoria
i
have
anticipated
matters
a
little
in
telling
of
my
tutor
departure
i
must
hark
back
and
pick
up
the
thread
of
victoria
history
from
the
time
when
i
was
hard
on
thirteen
and
she
near
fifteen
the
time
when
she
had
implored
me
to
rid
her
of
krak
i
had
hated
krak
with
that
healthy
antipathy
whose
faculty
one
seems
to
lose
in
later
years
it
is
a
tiresome
thing
to
be
driven
by
experience
to
the
discovery
of
some
good
in
everybody
your
fine
black
fades
to
neutral
gray
often
i
regret
the
delightfully
partial
views
of
earlier
days
and
so
many
people
succeed
in
preserving
them
to
a
green
and
untutored
old
age
they
are
popes
always
to
their
heretics
such
was
and
is
victoria
she
never
changed
in
her
views
of
other
people
in
contrast
she
was
as
regards
herself
of
a
temperament
so
elastic
that
impressions
endured
hardly
a
moment
beyond
the
blow
and
pleasures
passed
without
depositing
any
residuum
which
might
form
a
store
against
evil
days
if
krak
had
cut
her
arm
off
its
perpetual
absence
might
have
made
victoria
remember
the
fault
which
was
paid
for
by
amputation
the
moral
effect
of
rapid
knuckles
disappeared
with
the
comfort
that
came
from
sucking
them
perhaps
her
disposition
was
a
happy
chance
for
her
since
the
styrian
discipline
although
not
of
course
in
this
blankly
physical
form
later
on
persisted
for
her
long
after
it
had
been
softened
for
me
i
touch
again
perhaps
on
a
point
which
has
caught
my
attention
before
undoubtedly
my
mother
kept
the
status
of
childhood
imposed
on
victoria
fully
as
long
as
nature
countenanced
the
measures
krak
did
not
go
a
laugh
greeted
my
hint
krak
stayed
till
victoria
was
sixteen
for
my
part
since
it
was
inevitable
that
krak
should
discipline
somebody
i
think
heaven
was
mild
in
setting
her
on
victoria
had
i
stayed
under
her
sway
i
should
have
run
mad
victoria
laughed
cried
joked
dared
submitted
offended
defied
suffered
wept
and
laughed
again
all
in
a
winter
afternoon
she
was
by
way
of
putting
on
the
dignity
of
an
elder
with
me
and
shutting
off
from
my
gaze
her
trials
and
reverses
but
there
was
no
one
else
to
tell
the
joke
to
and
i
had
it
all
each
night
before
i
slept
but
now
victoria
was
sixteen
and
krak
elderly
pensioned
but
unbroken
was
gone
she
went
back
to
styria
to
chasten
and
ultimately
to
enrich
i
would
not
for
the
world
have
been
privy
to
their
prayers
some
nephews
and
nieces
it
seemed
strange
but
krak
was
homesick
for
styria
she
went
victoria
gave
her
the
tribute
of
a
tear
surprised
out
of
her
before
she
remembered
her
causes
for
exultation
then
came
their
memory
and
she
was
outrageously
triumphant
a
new
era
began
the
buffer
was
gone
my
mother
and
victoria
were
face
and
face
and
in
a
year
as
victoria
said
in
two
or
three
as
my
mother
allowed
victoria
would
be
grown
up
i
was
myself
most
unwillingly
a
cause
of
annoyance
to
victoria
and
a
pretext
for
her
repression
importance
flowed
in
on
me
unasked
unearned
to
speak
in
homely
fashion
she
was
always
a
bad
second
and
none
save
herself
attributed
to
her
the
normal
status
of
privileges
of
an
elder
sister
her
wrath
was
not
visited
on
me
but
on
those
who
exalted
me
so
unduly
even
while
she
resented
my
position
she
was
not
as
i
have
shown
above
using
it
for
her
own
ends
this
adaptability
was
not
due
to
guile
she
forgot
one
mood
when
another
came
and
compromised
her
pretensions
in
the
effort
to
compass
her
desires
princess
heinrich
seized
on
the
inconsistency
and
pointed
it
out
to
her
daughter
with
an
exasperating
lucidity
you
are
ready
enough
to
remember
that
augustin
is
king
when
you
want
anything
from
him
she
would
observe
you
forget
it
only
when
you
are
asked
to
give
way
to
him
victoria
would
make
no
reply
the
krak
traditions
endured
to
prevent
an
answer
to
rebukes
but
when
we
were
alone
she
used
to
remark
i
should
think
an
iceberg
rather
like
a
mother
only
one
need
live
with
icebergs
quite
suddenly
as
it
seemed
it
occurred
to
victoria
that
she
was
pretty
she
lost
no
time
in
advertising
the
discovery
through
the
medium
of
a
thousand
new
tricks
and
graces
a
determined
assault
on
the
affections
of
all
the
men
about
us
from
the
down
to
the
stablemen
an
assault
that
ignored
existing
domestic
ties
or
affections
was
the
next
move
in
her
campaign
when
she
was
extremely
angry
with
her
mother
she
would
say
how
odious
it
must
be
not
to
be
young
any
more
i
thought
that
there
was
sometimes
a
wistful
look
in
my
mother
eyes
was
she
thinking
of
krak
krak
in
styria
perhaps
for
once
when
victoria
was
hitting
covertly
at
krak
my
mother
remarked
in
a
very
cold
voice
you
remember
your
punishments
you
do
remember
your
offences
victoria
i
could
linger
long
on
these
small
matters
for
i
find
more
interest
and
incitement
to
analysis
in
the
attitude
of
women
toward
women
than
in
their
more
obvious
relations
with
men
but
i
must
pass
over
a
year
of
veiled
conflict
and
come
to
that
incident
which
is
the
salient
point
in
victoria
girlish
history
it
coincided
almost
exactly
in
time
with
the
dismissal
of
geoffrey
owen
and
my
with
that
event
diverted
my
attention
from
the
earlier
stages
of
victoria
affair
she
was
just
seventeen
grown
up
in
her
own
esteem
and
she
adduced
many
precedents
to
fortify
her
contention
but
in
my
mother
eyes
still
wanting
a
year
of
quiet
home
life
before
she
should
be
launched
into
society
victoria
acquiesced
perforce
but
turned
the
flank
of
the
decree
by
ensuring
that
the
home
life
should
be
by
no
means
quiet
she
set
to
work
to
prepare
for
us
a
play
comedy
or
tragedy
i
knew
not
then
and
am
not
now
quite
clear
our
nearest
neighbour
at
artenberg
dwelt
across
the
river
in
the
picturesque
old
castle
of
waldenweiter
he
was
a
young
man
of
at
this
time
handsome
pleasant
and
ready
for
amusement
his
father
being
dead
frederick
was
his
own
master
that
is
to
say
he
had
no
master
victoria
fell
in
love
with
him
the
baron
it
seemed
was
not
disinclined
for
a
romance
with
a
pretty
princess
perhaps
he
thought
that
nothing
serious
would
come
of
it
and
that
it
was
a
pleasant
way
enough
of
passing
a
summer
or
perhaps
being
but
he
did
not
think
at
all
unless
to
muse
on
the
depth
of
the
blue
in
victoria
eyes
and
the
comely
lines
of
her
figure
as
she
rowed
on
the
river
to
say
truth
victoria
gave
him
small
time
for
reflection
as
i
am
convinced
before
he
had
well
considered
the
situation
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
attending
a
in
a
backwater
of
the
stream
about
a
mile
above
artenberg
victoria
never
went
out
unaccompanied
and
never
came
back
unaccompanied
it
was
discovered
afterward
that
the
trusted
old
boatman
could
be
bought
off
with
the
price
of
beer
and
used
to
disembark
and
seek
an
ale
house
so
soon
as
the
backwater
was
reached
the
meeting
over
victoria
would
return
in
high
spirits
and
displaying
an
unusual
affection
toward
my
mother
either
as
a
blind
or
through
remorse
or
as
i
incline
to
think
through
an
amiability
born
of
triumph
there
was
at
times
even
a
touch
of
commiseration
in
her
manner
and
more
than
once
she
spoke
to
me
in
a
tone
of
philosophical
speculation
on
the
uselessness
of
endeavouring
to
repress
natural
feelings
and
the
futility
of
treating
as
children
persons
who
were
already
grown
up
this
mood
lasted
some
time
so
long
i
suppose
as
the
stolen
delight
of
doing
the
thing
was
more
prominent
than
the
delight
in
the
thing
itself
a
month
passed
and
brought
a
change
now
she
was
silent
absent
pensive
very
kind
to
me
more
genuinely
submissive
and
dutiful
to
her
mother
the
first
force
of
my
blow
had
left
me
for
owen
had
been
gone
now
some
months
i
began
to
observe
my
sister
carefully
to
my
amazement
she
formerly
the
most
heedless
of
creatures
knew
in
an
instant
that
she
was
watched
she
drew
off
from
me
setting
a
distance
between
us
my
answer
was
to
withdraw
my
companionship
since
only
thus
could
i
convince
her
that
i
had
no
desire
to
spy
i
had
not
guessed
the
truth
and
my
mother
had
no
inkling
of
it
princess
heinrich
ignorance
may
seem
strange
but
i
have
often
observed
that
persons
of
a
masterful
temper
are
rather
easy
to
delude
they
have
such
difficulty
in
conceiving
that
they
can
be
disobeyed
as
to
become
ready
subjects
for
hoodwinking
i
recollect
old
hammerfeldt
saying
to
me
in
public
affairs
sire
always
expect
disobedience
but
be
chary
of
rewarding
obedience
my
mother
adopted
the
second
half
of
the
maxim
but
disregarded
the
first
she
always
expected
obedience
victoria
knew
it
and
built
on
her
knowledge
a
confident
hope
of
impunity
in
deceit
now
on
what
harsh
word
have
i
stumbled
for
deceit
savours
of
meanness
let
me
amend
and
seek
the
charity
the
neutral
tolerance
of
some
such
word
as
concealment
for
things
good
and
things
bad
may
be
concealed
things
that
people
should
know
and
things
that
concern
them
not
great
secrets
of
state
and
the
flutterings
of
hearts
victoria
practised
concealment
i
found
her
crying
once
crying
alone
in
a
corner
of
the
terrace
under
a
ludicrous
old
statue
of
mercury
i
was
amazed
i
had
not
seen
her
cry
so
heartily
since
krak
had
last
her
i
put
it
to
her
that
some
such
affliction
must
be
responsible
for
her
despair
i
wish
it
was
only
that
she
answered
do
go
away
augustin
i
do
want
to
stay
said
i
only
if
you
want
anything
i
wonder
if
you
could
she
said
with
a
sudden
flush
no
it
no
use
she
went
on
and
it
nothing
augustin
if
you
tell
mother
you
found
me
crying
i
never
you
know
quite
well
that
i
never
tell
anybody
anything
said
i
rather
offended
then
go
away
dear
urged
victoria
i
went
away
i
had
been
feeling
very
lonely
myself
and
had
sought
out
victoria
for
company
sake
however
i
went
and
walked
alone
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
it
was
clear
that
victoria
did
not
want
me
and
apparently
i
could
do
nothing
for
her
i
have
never
found
myself
able
to
do
very
much
for
people
except
those
who
did
not
deserve
to
have
anything
done
for
them
perhaps
poor
victoria
did
but
i
was
not
aware
of
her
demerits
then
i
repeated
to
the
river
my
old
reflection
i
do
see
that
it
much
use
being
king
you
know
said
i
as
i
flung
a
pebble
and
looked
across
at
the
towers
of
waldenweiter
that
better
off
than
i
am
said
i
and
i
wished
again
that
victoria
had
not
sent
me
away
there
is
a
period
of
life
during
which
one
is
always
being
sent
away
and
it
is
not
quite
over
for
me
yet
in
spite
of
my
dignity
at
last
came
the
crash
a
little
carelessness
born
of
habit
and
impunity
the
treachery
of
the
old
boatman
under
the
temptation
of
a
gold
piece
the
girl
lack
of
when
charged
with
the
offence
here
was
enough
and
more
than
enough
i
recollect
being
summoned
to
my
mother
room
late
one
evening
just
about
my
bedtime
i
went
and
found
her
alone
with
victoria
the
princess
sat
in
her
great
victoria
was
leaning
against
the
wall
when
i
entered
her
handkerchief
was
crushed
in
one
hand
the
other
hand
clenched
by
her
side
augustin
said
the
princess
victoria
and
i
go
to
biarritz
victoria
quick
breathing
was
her
only
comment
my
mother
told
me
in
brief
curt
offensive
phrases
that
victoria
had
been
carrying
on
a
flirtation
with
our
opposite
neighbour
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
looked
surprised
you
may
well
wonder
cried
my
mother
if
she
could
not
remember
what
she
was
herself
she
might
have
remembered
that
the
king
was
her
brother
i
done
nothing
victoria
began
hold
your
tongue
said
my
mother
if
you
were
in
styria
instead
of
here
you
be
locked
up
in
your
own
room
for
a
month
on
bread
and
water
yes
you
may
think
yourself
lucky
that
i
only
take
you
to
biarritz
styria
said
victoria
with
a
very
bitter
smile
if
i
were
in
styria
i
should
be
beheaded
i
daresay
or
or
knouted
or
something
oh
i
know
what
styria
means
krak
taught
me
that
i
wish
the
baroness
was
here
observed
the
princess
you
tell
her
to
beat
me
i
suppose
flashed
out
my
sister
if
you
were
three
years
younger
began
my
mother
with
perfect
outward
composure
victoria
interrupted
her
passionately
oh
never
mind
my
age
i
a
child
still
come
and
beat
me
she
cried
assuming
the
air
of
an
iphigenia
to
this
day
i
am
of
opinion
that
she
ran
a
risk
in
giving
this
invitation
it
was
well
on
the
cards
that
the
princess
might
have
accepted
it
indeed
had
it
been
styria
but
it
was
not
styria
my
mother
turned
to
me
with
a
cold
smile
you
perceive
said
she
the
spirit
in
which
your
sister
meets
me
because
i
object
to
her
compromising
herself
with
this
wretched
baron
she
accuses
me
of
persecution
and
talks
as
though
i
were
an
executioner
i
had
been
looking
very
curiously
at
victoria
she
was
in
a
having
been
called
apparently
from
her
bedroom
her
hair
was
over
her
shoulders
she
looked
most
prettily
like
juliet
before
her
angry
father
or
as
i
say
iphigenia
before
the
knife
in
a
moment
she
broke
out
again
nobody
feels
for
me
she
complained
what
can
augustin
know
of
it
i
know
observed
my
mother
but
although
i
know
oh
you
forgotten
cried
victoria
scornfully
for
a
moment
my
mother
flushed
i
was
glad
on
all
accounts
that
victoria
did
not
repeat
her
previous
invitation
now
on
the
contrary
when
she
had
looked
at
princess
heinrich
she
gave
a
sudden
frightened
sob
rushed
across
the
room
and
flung
herself
on
her
knees
at
my
feet
you
the
king
she
cried
protect
me
protect
me
throughout
all
this
very
painful
interview
i
seemed
to
hear
as
it
were
echoes
of
the
romances
which
i
had
read
on
victoria
recommendation
the
reminiscence
was
particularly
strong
in
this
last
exclamation
however
it
is
not
safe
to
conclude
that
feelings
are
not
sincere
because
they
are
expressed
in
conventional
phrases
these
formulas
are
moulds
into
which
our
words
run
easily
though
the
moulds
be
hollow
the
stuff
that
fills
them
may
be
solid
enough
why
you
do
want
to
marry
him
i
exclaimed
much
embarrassed
at
being
prematurely
forced
into
functions
of
a
de
i
never
marry
anybody
else
moaned
victoria
my
mother
face
was
the
picture
of
disgust
and
scorn
that
another
thing
said
she
at
least
the
king
would
not
hear
of
such
a
marriage
as
this
do
you
want
to
marry
him
i
asked
victoria
chiefly
i
confess
in
curiosity
i
had
risen
or
fallen
in
some
degree
to
my
position
and
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
my
sister
should
wish
to
marry
this
baron
fritz
i
i
love
him
augustin
groaned
victoria
she
knows
it
impossible
as
well
as
you
do
said
my
mother
she
does
really
want
to
do
it
victoria
cried
quietly
but
made
no
reply
or
protest
i
was
bewildered
i
did
not
understand
then
how
we
may
passionately
desire
a
thing
which
we
would
not
do
and
may
snatch
at
the
opposition
of
others
as
an
excuse
alike
for
refusal
and
for
tears
looking
back
i
do
not
think
had
we
set
victoria
free
in
the
boat
and
put
the
sculls
in
her
hands
that
she
would
have
rowed
over
to
waldenweiter
but
did
she
then
deserve
no
pity
perhaps
she
deserved
more
for
not
two
weak
creatures
like
the
princess
i
crave
her
pardon
and
myself
stood
between
her
and
her
wishes
but
she
herself
the
being
that
she
had
been
fashioned
into
her
whole
life
her
nature
and
her
heart
as
our
state
had
made
them
if
our
soul
be
our
prison
and
ourself
the
jailer
in
vain
shall
we
plan
escape
or
offer
bribes
for
freedom
wheresoever
we
go
we
carry
the
walls
with
us
and
if
death
then
death
alone
can
unlock
the
gates
the
scene
grew
quieter
victoria
rose
and
threw
herself
into
a
chair
in
a
weary
puzzled
desolation
my
mother
sat
quite
still
with
eyes
intent
on
the
floor
and
lips
close
shut
a
sense
of
awkwardness
grew
strong
on
me
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
room
they
would
not
fight
any
more
now
they
would
be
very
distant
to
one
another
and
moreover
it
seemed
clear
that
victoria
did
not
propose
to
marry
baron
fritz
but
what
about
poor
baron
fritz
i
approached
my
mother
and
whispered
a
question
she
answered
me
aloud
i
have
written
to
prince
von
hammerfeldt
a
letter
from
him
will
i
have
no
doubt
be
enough
to
insure
us
against
further
impertinence
victoria
dabbed
her
eyes
but
no
protest
came
from
her
we
shall
start
the
princess
pursued
unless
of
course
victoria
refuses
to
accompany
me
her
voice
took
a
tinge
of
irony
possibly
your
wishes
may
persuade
her
augustin
if
mine
can
not
victoria
raised
her
head
suddenly
and
said
very
distinctly
i
will
do
what
augustin
tells
me
the
emphatic
word
in
that
sentence
was
augustin
my
mother
smiled
bitterly
she
understood
well
enough
the
implicit
declaration
of
war
the
appeal
from
her
to
me
the
shifting
of
allegiance
i
daresay
that
she
saw
the
absurdity
of
putting
a
boy
not
yet
sixteen
into
such
a
position
but
i
know
that
i
felt
it
much
more
strongly
oh
you
better
go
had
you
i
asked
uncomfortably
you
be
very
jolly
here
you
know
i
do
as
you
tell
me
augustin
yes
we
are
both
at
your
orders
said
my
mother
it
crossed
my
mind
that
their
journey
would
not
be
a
very
pleasant
one
but
i
did
not
feel
able
to
enter
into
that
side
of
the
question
i
resented
this
reference
to
me
and
desired
to
be
rid
of
the
affair
i
should
like
you
to
do
as
mother
suggests
said
i
very
well
augustin
said
victoria
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
she
was
a
tall
graceful
girl
and
looked
very
stately
as
she
walked
by
her
mother
the
princess
made
no
movement
or
sign
the
grim
smile
persisted
on
her
lips
after
a
moment
or
two
of
wavering
i
followed
my
sister
from
the
room
she
was
just
ahead
of
me
in
the
passage
moving
toward
her
bedroom
with
a
slow
listless
tread
an
impulse
of
sympathy
came
upon
me
i
ran
after
her
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
kissed
her
cheer
up
i
said
oh
it
all
right
augustin
said
she
i
only
been
a
fool
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
so
i
kissed
her
again
fancy
biarritz
with
mother
she
moaned
then
she
turned
on
me
suddenly
almost
fiercely
but
what
the
good
of
asking
anything
of
you
you
afraid
of
mother
still
i
drew
back
as
though
she
had
struck
me
a
moment
later
her
arms
were
round
my
neck
oh
never
mind
my
dear
she
sobbed
do
you
see
i
miserable
of
course
i
must
go
with
her
i
had
never
supposed
that
any
other
course
was
practicable
the
introduction
of
myself
into
the
business
had
been
but
a
move
in
the
game
nevertheless
it
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
position
for
me
as
rich
in
discomfort
as
according
to
my
experience
are
most
extensions
of
power
chapter
vi
a
student
of
love
affairs
the
departure
to
biarritz
was
carried
through
without
further
overt
hostilities
it
chanced
to
be
holidays
with
me
all
my
tutors
were
on
their
vacation
my
governor
vohrenlorf
on
a
visit
at
berlin
hearing
of
my
solitude
he
insisted
on
making
arrangements
to
return
speedily
but
for
a
few
days
i
was
left
quite
alone
saving
for
the
presence
of
my
french
baptiste
i
liked
baptiste
he
was
by
conviction
an
anarchist
by
prejudice
a
freethinker
one
shrug
of
his
shoulders
disposed
of
the
institutions
of
this
world
another
relegated
the
next
to
the
limbo
of
delusions
he
was
always
respectful
but
possessed
an
unconquerably
intimate
manner
he
could
not
forget
that
man
spoke
to
man
although
one
might
be
putting
on
the
other
boots
for
him
he
regarded
me
with
mingled
affection
and
pity
i
had
overheard
him
speaking
of
pauvre
petit
the
point
of
view
was
so
much
my
own
that
from
the
instant
my
heart
went
out
to
baptiste
since
he
attributed
to
me
no
he
was
not
officious
or
persistent
in
his
attendance
while
he
was
on
duty
in
fact
he
left
me
very
much
to
my
own
devices
to
my
mother
he
was
polite
but
cold
he
adored
victoria
declaring
that
she
was
worthy
of
being
french
his
great
hatred
was
for
hammerfeldt
whom
he
accused
of
embodying
the
devil
of
teutonism
hammerfeldt
was
aware
of
his
feelings
and
played
with
them
while
he
trusted
baptiste
more
than
anybody
about
me
he
did
not
know
how
attached
i
was
to
the
frenchman
and
i
did
not
intend
that
he
should
learn
i
had
received
a
sharp
lesson
with
regard
to
parading
my
preferences
it
was
through
baptiste
that
i
heard
of
baron
fritz
side
of
the
case
for
baptiste
was
friendly
with
fritz
servants
the
baron
it
appeared
was
in
despair
they
watch
him
when
he
walks
by
the
river
declared
baptiste
with
a
gesture
in
which
dismay
and
satisfaction
were
curiously
blended
poor
fellow
said
i
leaning
back
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
to
be
in
such
a
state
on
victoria
account
was
odd
and
deplorable
baptiste
laid
down
the
sculls
and
leaned
forward
smiling
it
is
nothing
sire
said
he
it
must
happen
now
and
again
to
all
of
us
le
baron
will
soon
be
well
meanwhile
he
is
oh
miserable
is
he
all
alone
there
i
asked
absolutely
sire
he
will
see
nobody
i
looked
up
at
waldenweiter
he
has
not
even
his
mother
with
him
said
baptiste
the
remark
as
baptiste
delivered
it
was
impertinent
and
yet
so
intangibly
impertinent
as
to
afford
no
handle
for
reproof
he
meant
that
the
baron
was
free
from
an
aggravation
he
said
that
he
lacked
a
consolation
shall
i
go
and
see
him
i
asked
in
truth
i
was
rather
curious
about
him
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
break
out
of
my
own
surroundings
what
would
the
prince
say
said
baptiste
he
need
not
know
row
ashore
there
you
must
not
go
sire
it
would
be
known
and
they
would
say
baptiste
shrug
was
eloquent
do
they
always
talk
about
everything
one
does
certainly
sire
it
is
your
privilege
smiled
my
servant
but
i
think
he
might
come
to
you
that
could
be
managed
not
in
the
schloss
but
in
the
wood
quite
privately
i
can
contrive
it
baptiste
did
contrive
it
and
baron
fritz
came
i
was
now
just
too
old
to
scorn
love
just
too
young
to
sympathize
fully
with
it
there
is
that
age
in
a
boy
life
but
since
he
holds
his
tongue
about
it
it
is
apt
to
escape
notice
and
people
jest
on
the
sudden
change
in
his
attitude
toward
women
nothing
in
nature
is
sudden
no
more
then
is
this
transition
i
looked
curiously
at
fritz
he
was
timid
with
me
i
perceived
that
he
was
not
an
ordinary
young
nobleman
devoted
only
to
sport
and
wine
he
had
something
of
owen
romance
but
in
him
it
was
not
open
wide
to
embrace
the
universe
of
things
beautiful
and
ugly
he
thanked
me
for
receiving
him
in
a
rather
elaborate
and
artificial
fashion
i
wondered
at
once
that
he
had
caught
fancy
her
temperament
seemed
too
robust
for
him
he
began
to
speak
of
her
in
some
very
poetical
phrases
he
quoted
a
line
of
poetry
about
diana
and
endymion
i
had
been
made
to
turn
it
into
latin
verses
and
its
sentiment
fell
cold
on
my
soul
he
spoke
of
his
passion
with
desperation
and
i
thought
with
pride
he
said
that
happen
what
might
his
whole
life
was
the
princess
but
he
did
not
mention
name
he
said
her
with
an
air
of
mystery
as
though
spies
lurked
in
the
woods
there
was
nobody
save
baptiste
standing
sentry
to
guard
this
secret
meeting
i
gave
the
baron
a
cigarette
and
lit
one
myself
i
had
begun
the
habit
though
still
surreptitiously
you
must
have
known
there
be
a
row
i
suggested
tell
me
of
her
he
cried
is
she
in
great
grief
i
did
not
want
to
tell
him
about
victoria
i
wanted
him
to
tell
me
about
himself
as
soon
as
he
understood
this
i
am
bound
to
say
that
he
gratified
me
at
once
i
sat
looking
at
him
while
he
described
his
feelings
all
at
once
he
turned
and
discovered
my
gaze
on
him
go
on
said
i
the
baron
appeared
uncomfortable
his
eyes
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
tried
to
puff
at
his
cigarette
which
he
had
allowed
to
go
out
i
daresay
he
thought
me
a
strange
boy
but
he
could
not
very
well
say
so
you
do
understand
it
he
asked
partly
i
answered
we
never
had
any
hope
said
he
almost
luxuriously
but
you
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
suggested
i
was
quite
grave
about
it
in
my
mind
as
well
as
in
my
face
ah
sighed
he
softly
and
now
it
all
over
i
see
her
no
more
i
think
of
her
she
thinks
of
me
perhaps
said
i
meditatively
i
was
wondering
whether
they
did
not
think
more
about
themselves
did
you
think
you
might
manage
it
alas
no
sorrow
was
always
in
our
joy
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
what
is
there
for
me
to
do
he
asked
despairingly
sometimes
i
think
that
i
can
not
endure
to
live
baptiste
told
me
that
they
watched
you
when
you
walked
by
the
river
he
turned
to
me
with
a
very
interested
expression
of
face
do
they
really
he
asked
so
baptiste
said
i
promised
her
that
whatever
happened
i
would
do
nothing
rash
said
he
what
would
her
feelings
be
we
should
all
be
very
much
distressed
said
i
in
my
best
court
manner
ah
the
world
the
world
sighed
baron
fritz
then
with
an
air
of
great
courage
he
went
on
yet
how
am
i
so
different
from
her
i
think
you
are
very
much
alike
said
i
but
she
is
a
princess
i
felt
that
he
was
laying
a
sort
of
responsibility
on
me
i
could
not
help
victoria
being
a
princess
he
laughed
bitterly
i
seemed
to
be
put
on
my
defence
i
think
it
just
as
absurd
as
you
do
i
hastened
to
say
absurd
he
echoed
i
did
say
that
i
thought
it
absurd
would
not
your
majesty
rather
say
tragic
there
must
be
kings
princes
princesses
our
hearts
pay
the
price
i
was
growing
rather
weary
of
this
baron
and
wondering
more
and
more
what
victoria
had
discovered
in
him
but
my
lack
of
knowledge
led
me
into
an
error
i
attributed
what
wearied
me
in
no
degree
to
the
baron
himself
but
altogether
to
his
condition
this
then
is
what
it
is
to
be
in
love
i
was
saying
to
myself
i
summoned
up
the
relics
of
my
scorn
once
so
abundant
and
vigorous
the
baron
perhaps
detected
the
beginnings
of
he
rose
to
his
feet
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
your
majesty
will
understand
my
feelings
better
in
two
or
three
years
he
observed
i
suppose
i
shall
i
answered
rather
uneasily
meanwhile
i
must
live
it
down
i
must
master
it
it
the
only
thing
to
do
and
she
oh
she
get
over
it
i
assured
him
nodding
my
head
i
am
inclined
sometimes
to
count
it
among
my
misfortunes
that
the
first
love
affair
with
which
i
was
brought
into
intimate
connection
and
confronted
at
an
age
still
so
impressionable
should
have
been
of
the
shallow
and
somewhat
artificial
character
betrayed
by
the
romance
of
my
sister
and
baron
fritz
she
was
a
headstrong
girl
longing
to
exercise
power
over
men
surprised
when
a
temporary
gust
of
feeling
carried
her
into
an
emotion
unexpectedly
strong
he
was
a
fellow
hugging
his
woes
and
delighting
in
the
picturesqueness
of
his
misfortune
the
notion
left
on
my
mind
was
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
about
the
matter
baptiste
strengthened
my
opinion
i
ask
your
pardon
sire
he
said
with
a
shrug
but
we
know
the
sentimentality
of
the
germans
what
is
it
sighs
and
then
beer
more
sighs
and
more
beer
a
deluge
of
sighs
and
a
deluge
of
beer
a
frenchman
is
not
like
that
in
his
little
affairs
what
does
a
frenchman
do
baptiste
i
had
the
curiosity
to
ask
ah
laughed
baptiste
if
i
told
your
majesty
now
you
would
not
care
to
visit
paris
and
i
long
to
go
to
paris
with
your
majesty
i
did
not
pursue
the
subject
i
was
conscious
of
a
disenchantment
begun
by
victoria
continued
by
the
baron
the
reaction
made
in
favour
of
my
mother
i
acknowledged
the
wisdom
of
her
firmness
and
an
excuse
for
her
anger
i
realized
her
causes
for
annoyance
and
shame
and
saw
the
hollowness
of
the
lovers
pleas
i
had
thought
the
princess
very
hard
i
was
now
inclined
to
think
that
she
had
shown
as
much
as
could
be
expected
from
her
rather
to
my
own
surprise
i
found
myself
extending
this
more
favourable
judgment
of
her
to
other
matters
entering
with
a
new
sympathy
into
her
disposition
and
even
forgiving
some
harsh
thing
which
i
had
never
pardoned
the
idea
suggested
itself
to
my
mind
that
even
the
rigours
of
the
styrian
discipline
had
a
rational
relation
to
the
position
which
the
victims
of
it
were
destined
to
fill
she
might
be
right
in
supposing
that
we
could
not
be
allowed
the
indulgence
accorded
to
the
common
run
of
children
we
were
destined
for
a
special
purpose
and
if
we
were
not
made
of
a
special
clay
yet
we
must
be
fashioned
into
a
special
shape
it
is
hard
to
disentangle
the
influence
of
one
event
from
that
exerted
by
another
perhaps
the
loss
of
owen
and
the
consequently
increased
influence
of
hammerfeldt
over
my
life
and
thoughts
had
as
much
to
do
with
my
new
feelings
as
love
affair
but
in
any
case
i
date
from
this
time
a
fresh
development
of
myself
i
was
growing
into
my
kingship
beginning
to
realize
the
conception
of
it
and
to
fill
up
that
conception
in
my
own
mind
this
moment
was
of
importance
to
me
for
it
marked
the
beginning
of
a
period
during
which
this
idea
of
my
position
was
very
dominant
and
coloured
all
i
did
or
thought
i
did
not
change
my
opinion
as
to
the
discomfort
of
the
post
but
its
importance
its
sacredness
and
its
paramount
claims
grew
larger
and
larger
in
my
eyes
it
seems
curious
but
had
baron
fritz
been
a
different
sort
of
lover
i
think
that
i
should
have
been
in
some
respects
a
different
sort
of
a
king
it
needs
a
constant
intellectual
effort
to
believe
that
there
is
anything
except
accident
in
the
course
of
the
world
hammerfeldt
persistent
pressure
drove
the
baron
still
undrowned
had
the
watchers
been
too
vigilant
on
a
long
foreign
tour
and
in
three
months
the
princess
and
victoria
returned
i
saw
at
once
that
the
new
relations
were
permanently
established
between
them
my
mother
displayed
an
almost
ostentatious
abdication
of
authority
her
whole
air
declared
that
since
victoria
chose
to
walk
alone
alone
in
good
truth
she
should
walk
it
was
the
attitude
of
a
proud
and
domineering
nature
that
answers
any
objection
to
its
sway
by
a
wholesale
disclaimer
at
once
of
power
and
responsibility
victoria
accepted
her
mother
resolution
but
rather
with
resentment
than
gratitude
they
had
managed
the
affair
badly
my
mother
had
lost
influence
without
gaining
affection
my
sister
had
forfeited
guidance
but
not
achieved
a
true
liberty
she
was
hardly
more
her
own
mistress
than
before
hammerfeldt
screened
behind
me
now
trammelled
her
and
she
had
a
statesman
to
deal
with
instead
of
a
mother
only
once
she
spoke
to
me
concerning
the
baron
and
his
affair
the
three
months
had
wrought
some
change
here
also
i
was
very
silly
she
said
impatiently
i
know
that
well
enough
then
why
do
you
make
it
up
with
mother
i
ventured
to
suggest
mother
behaved
odiously
she
declared
i
can
never
forgive
her
the
way
she
treated
me
the
grievance
then
had
shifted
its
ground
not
what
the
princess
had
done
but
the
manner
in
which
she
had
done
it
was
now
the
head
and
front
of
her
offence
it
needed
little
acquaintance
with
the
world
to
recognise
that
matters
were
not
improved
by
this
change
one
may
come
to
recognise
that
common
sense
was
with
the
enemy
vanity
at
once
takes
refuge
in
the
conviction
that
his
awkwardness
rudeness
or
cruelty
in
advancing
his
case
was
responsible
for
all
the
trouble
if
she
had
been
kind
i
should
have
seen
it
all
directly
said
victoria
and
in
this
it
may
very
well
be
that
victoria
was
not
altogether
wrong
the
position
was
however
inconsistent
with
even
moderate
comfort
there
was
a
way
of
ending
it
obvious
i
suppose
to
everybody
save
myself
but
seeming
rather
startling
to
my
youthful
mind
in
six
months
now
victoria
would
be
eighteen
and
eighteen
is
a
marriageable
age
victoria
must
be
married
my
mother
and
hammerfeldt
went
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
the
scheme
i
was
ready
with
brotherly
sympathy
and
even
cherished
the
idea
of
interposing
a
hitherto
untried
royal
veto
on
such
premature
haste
and
cruel
forcing
of
a
girl
inclination
victoria
received
my
advances
with
visible
surprise
did
i
suppose
she
asked
that
she
was
so
happy
at
home
as
to
shrink
from
marriage
would
not
such
a
step
be
rather
an
emancipation
than
a
banishment
i
paraphrase
and
condense
her
observation
did
i
not
perceive
that
she
must
hail
the
prospect
with
relief
i
was
to
know
that
her
mother
and
herself
were
at
one
on
this
matter
she
was
obliged
for
my
kindness
but
thought
that
i
need
not
concern
myself
in
the
matter
considerably
relieved
not
less
puzzled
with
a
picture
of
victoria
sobbing
and
the
baron
walking
well
watched
by
the
brink
i
withdrew
from
my
sister
presence
it
occurred
to
me
that
to
take
a
husband
in
order
to
escape
from
a
mother
was
a
peculiar
step
i
have
since
seen
reason
to
suppose
that
it
is
more
common
than
i
imagined
the
history
of
my
private
life
is
to
speak
broadly
the
record
of
the
reaction
of
my
public
capacity
on
my
personal
position
the
effect
of
this
reaction
has
been
almost
uniformly
unfortunate
the
case
of
victoria
marriage
affords
a
good
instance
it
might
have
been
that
here
at
least
i
should
be
suffered
to
play
a
fraternal
and
grateful
part
my
fate
and
hammerfeldt
ruled
otherwise
there
were
two
persons
who
suggested
themselves
as
suitable
mates
for
my
sister
one
was
the
reigning
king
of
a
country
which
i
need
not
name
the
other
was
prince
william
adolphus
of
a
prince
of
considerable
wealth
and
unexceptionable
descent
but
not
in
the
direct
succession
to
a
throne
not
likely
to
occupy
a
prominent
position
in
europe
victoria
had
never
quite
forgiven
fortune
or
perhaps
me
either
for
not
making
her
a
queen
in
the
first
instance
she
was
eager
to
repair
the
error
she
came
to
me
and
begged
me
to
exert
my
influence
in
behalf
of
the
king
who
was
understood
through
his
advisers
to
favour
the
suggestion
i
was
most
happy
to
second
her
wishes
although
entirely
sceptical
as
to
the
value
of
my
assistance
i
recollect
very
well
the
interview
that
followed
between
hammerfeldt
and
myself
throughout
the
prince
treated
me
speaking
with
absolute
candour
disclosing
to
me
the
whole
question
and
assuming
in
me
an
elevation
of
spirit
superior
to
merely
personal
feelings
after
your
majesty
said
he
the
princess
is
heir
to
the
throne
we
have
received
representations
that
the
union
of
the
two
countries
in
one
hand
could
not
be
contemplated
by
the
powers
now
you
sire
are
young
you
are
and
must
be
for
some
years
unmarried
life
is
uncertain
and
here
he
looked
at
me
steadily
your
physicians
are
of
opinion
that
certain
seeds
of
weakness
sown
by
your
severe
illness
have
not
yet
been
eradicated
from
your
constitution
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
offer
these
observations
to
your
majesty
the
old
man
eyes
were
very
kind
it
all
right
sir
said
i
go
on
we
all
trust
that
you
may
live
through
a
long
reign
and
that
your
son
may
reign
after
you
it
is
indeed
the
only
strong
wish
that
i
have
left
in
a
world
which
i
have
done
with
but
the
other
possibility
has
been
set
before
us
and
we
can
not
ignore
it
from
that
moment
i
myself
never
ignored
it
it
was
suggested
that
princess
victoria
should
renounce
her
rights
of
succession
i
need
not
remind
your
majesty
that
the
result
would
be
to
make
your
cousin
prince
ferdinand
i
desire
to
speak
with
all
respect
of
the
prince
but
his
succession
would
be
an
unmixed
calamity
the
prince
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
ferdinand
was
very
liberal
in
his
theories
and
equally
so
in
a
rather
different
sense
in
his
mode
of
life
i
thought
for
a
moment
i
should
like
the
succession
to
go
out
of
our
branch
said
i
i
was
sure
of
it
sire
he
said
bowing
it
would
break
your
heart
and
mine
i
was
greatly
troubled
what
of
my
ready
inconsiderate
promise
to
victoria
and
apart
from
the
promise
i
would
most
eagerly
have
helped
her
to
her
way
i
had
felt
severely
the
lack
of
confidence
and
affection
that
had
recently
come
about
between
us
i
was
hungry
for
her
love
and
hoped
to
buy
it
of
her
gratitude
i
believe
old
hammerfeldt
keen
eyes
saw
all
that
passed
in
my
thoughts
the
styrian
teaching
had
left
its
mark
on
my
mind
as
had
the
styrian
discipline
on
my
soul
god
did
not
make
you
king
for
your
own
pleasure
krak
used
to
say
with
that
instinctive
knowledge
of
the
deity
which
marks
those
who
train
the
young
no
nor
for
my
sister
nor
even
that
i
might
conciliate
my
sister
love
nay
again
nor
even
that
i
might
make
my
sister
happy
for
none
of
these
ends
did
i
sit
where
i
sat
but
i
felt
very
forlorn
and
sad
as
i
looked
at
the
old
prince
victoria
will
be
very
angry
said
i
i
wanted
to
please
her
so
much
the
princess
has
her
duties
and
will
recognise
yours
he
answered
of
course
if
i
die
it
be
all
right
but
if
i
live
she
say
i
did
it
just
out
of
the
old
man
rose
from
his
chair
laying
his
snuffbox
on
the
table
by
him
he
came
up
to
me
and
held
out
both
his
hands
i
put
mine
into
them
and
looked
up
into
his
face
it
was
moved
by
a
most
rare
emotion
i
had
never
seen
him
like
this
before
sire
said
he
in
a
low
tone
do
not
think
that
nobody
loves
you
for
from
that
mood
it
may
come
that
a
man
will
love
nobody
there
is
an
old
man
that
loves
you
as
he
loved
your
father
and
your
grandfather
and
your
people
shall
love
you
he
bent
down
and
kissed
me
on
either
cheek
then
he
released
my
hands
and
stood
before
me
there
was
a
long
silence
then
he
said
have
i
your
majesty
authority
and
support
in
acting
for
the
good
of
the
kingdom
yes
said
i
but
alas
for
victoria
hopes
ambitions
and
vanity
for
her
crown
and
her
crowned
husband
alas
poor
sister
and
alas
poor
brother
hungry
to
be
friends
again
chapter
vii
things
not
to
be
noticed
i
have
not
the
heart
to
set
down
what
passed
between
my
sister
and
myself
when
i
broke
to
her
the
news
that
i
must
be
against
her
impulsive
in
all
her
moods
and
ungoverned
in
her
emotions
she
displayed
much
bitterness
and
an
anger
that
her
disappointment
may
excuse
i
have
little
doubt
that
i
on
my
part
was
formal
priggish
perhaps
absurd
all
these
faults
she
charged
me
with
you
can
not
put
great
ideas
in
a
boy
head
without
puffing
him
up
i
was
doing
at
cost
to
myself
what
i
was
convinced
was
my
duty
it
is
only
too
likely
that
i
gave
myself
some
airs
during
the
performance
might
i
not
be
pardoned
if
i
talked
a
little
big
about
my
position
the
price
i
was
paying
for
it
was
big
enough
it
touched
me
most
nearly
when
she
accused
me
of
jealousy
but
i
set
it
down
only
to
her
present
rage
i
was
tempted
to
soften
her
by
dwelling
on
my
own
precarious
health
but
i
am
glad
that
an
instinct
for
fair
play
made
me
leave
that
weapon
unused
she
grew
calm
at
last
and
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
pale
face
i
have
tried
to
do
right
said
i
i
shall
not
forget
what
you
have
done
she
retorted
as
she
walked
out
of
the
room
i
have
been
much
alone
in
my
life
alone
in
spirit
i
mean
for
that
is
the
only
loneliness
that
has
power
to
hurt
a
man
but
never
so
much
as
during
the
year
that
elapsed
before
victoria
marriage
was
celebrated
save
for
hammerfeldt
whose
engagements
did
not
allow
him
to
be
much
in
my
company
and
to
whom
it
was
possible
to
open
one
heart
only
rarely
i
had
nobody
with
whom
i
was
in
sympathy
for
my
mother
although
she
yielded
more
readily
to
the
inevitable
was
yet
in
secret
on
side
on
the
matter
of
marriage
victoria
had
been
for
meeting
the
foreign
representatives
by
renouncing
her
succession
my
mother
would
not
hear
of
that
but
was
for
defying
the
protests
nothing
she
had
declared
could
really
come
of
them
hammerfeldt
overbore
her
with
his
knowledge
and
experience
leaving
her
defeated
but
only
half
convinced
sullen
and
disappointed
she
was
careful
not
to
take
sides
against
me
overtly
but
neither
did
she
seek
to
comfort
or
to
aid
me
she
withdrew
into
a
neutrality
that
favoured
victoria
silently
although
it
refused
openly
to
espouse
her
cause
the
two
ladies
thus
came
closer
together
again
leaving
me
more
to
myself
the
near
prospect
of
independence
reconciled
victoria
to
a
temporary
control
my
mother
was
more
gentle
from
her
share
in
her
daughter
disappointment
for
my
part
i
took
refuge
more
and
more
in
books
and
my
sport
amusement
is
the
one
great
consolation
that
life
offers
and
even
in
this
dreary
time
it
was
not
lacking
the
baron
had
returned
to
waldenweiter
he
wrote
to
hammerfeldt
for
permission
the
prince
refused
it
the
baron
rejoined
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
i
can
imagine
the
grim
smile
with
which
the
old
man
withdrew
his
objection
the
baron
came
home
with
his
wife
this
event
nearly
broke
the
new
alliance
between
my
mother
and
my
sister
it
was
so
very
difficult
for
my
mother
not
to
triumph
and
victoria
detected
a
taunt
even
in
silence
however
there
was
no
rupture
the
baron
was
never
mentioned
but
i
seeking
distraction
made
it
my
business
to
pursue
him
as
often
as
he
ventured
into
his
boat
i
overtook
him
once
and
insisted
on
going
up
to
waldenweiter
and
being
introduced
to
the
pretty
young
baroness
she
knew
nothing
about
the
affair
and
was
rather
hurt
at
not
being
invited
to
artenberg
the
baron
was
on
thorns
during
the
whole
interview
but
not
so
much
because
he
must
be
looking
a
fool
in
my
eyes
as
because
he
did
not
desire
to
seem
light
of
love
in
his
wife
unhappily
however
about
this
time
a
pamphlet
was
secretly
printed
and
circulated
giving
a
tolerably
accurate
account
of
the
whole
affair
the
wrath
in
exalted
quarters
may
be
imagined
i
managed
to
procure
through
baptiste
a
copy
of
this
publication
and
read
it
with
much
entertainment
victoria
in
spite
of
her
anger
borrowed
it
from
me
it
is
within
my
knowledge
that
the
baroness
received
a
copy
from
an
unknown
friend
and
that
the
baron
being
thus
driven
into
a
corner
admitted
that
the
princess
had
at
one
time
distinguished
him
by
some
attentions
and
could
he
be
rude
now
curiously
enough
the
report
that
got
about
on
our
bank
of
the
river
was
that
there
was
no
foundation
at
all
for
the
assertions
of
the
pamphlet
except
in
a
foolish
and
persecution
to
which
the
princess
had
during
a
short
period
been
subjected
after
this
there
could
be
no
question
of
any
invitation
passing
from
artenberg
to
waldenweiter
the
subject
dropped
the
printer
made
some
little
scandal
and
a
pocket
full
of
money
and
persons
who
like
myself
knew
the
facts
and
could
appreciate
the
behaviour
of
the
lovers
gained
considerable
amusement
my
second
source
of
diversion
was
found
in
my
future
william
adolphus
of
he
was
in
himself
a
thoroughly
heavy
fellow
although
admirably
and
i
believe
a
practical
and
competent
soldier
he
was
tall
dark
and
even
at
this
time
inclining
to
stoutness
he
became
afterward
exceedingly
corpulent
he
did
not
at
first
promise
amusement
but
a
rather
malicious
humour
found
much
in
him
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
the
poor
fellow
was
acquainted
with
the
negotiations
touching
the
marriage
first
suggested
for
victoria
and
was
fully
aware
that
he
himself
was
in
his
lady
eyes
only
a
his
dignity
might
have
refused
such
a
situation
but
in
the
first
instance
he
had
been
hardly
more
of
a
free
agent
than
victoria
herself
and
later
on
as
though
he
were
determined
to
deprive
himself
of
all
defence
he
proceeded
to
fall
genuinely
in
love
with
my
capricious
but
very
attractive
sister
i
was
sorry
for
him
but
i
am
not
aware
that
sympathy
with
people
excludes
amusement
at
them
i
hope
not
for
wide
sympathies
are
a
very
desirable
thing
william
adolphus
looking
round
for
a
friend
honoured
me
with
his
confidence
and
during
his
visits
to
artenberg
used
to
consult
me
almost
daily
as
to
how
he
might
best
propitiate
his
deity
and
wean
her
thoughts
from
that
other
alliance
which
had
so
eclipsed
his
in
its
prospective
brilliance
girls
are
rather
difficult
to
manage
he
used
to
say
to
me
ruefully
you
know
more
about
them
in
a
few
years
augustin
i
knew
much
more
about
them
than
he
did
already
i
am
not
boasting
but
people
who
learn
only
from
experience
do
not
allow
for
intuition
but
i
think
she
beginning
to
get
fonder
of
me
he
would
end
with
an
uphill
cheerfulness
she
was
not
beginning
to
get
the
least
fonder
of
him
she
was
beginning
to
be
interested
and
excited
in
the
stir
of
the
marriage
there
were
so
many
things
to
do
and
talk
about
and
so
much
desirable
prominence
and
publicity
attaching
to
the
affair
that
she
had
less
time
for
nursing
her
dislike
the
shock
of
him
was
passing
over
he
was
falling
into
focus
with
the
rest
of
it
but
she
was
not
becoming
in
the
least
fonder
of
him
i
knew
all
this
without
the
few
words
with
them
he
knew
none
of
it
it
seems
to
be
a
mere
accident
who
chances
to
be
previous
to
truth
who
impervious
in
loneliness
for
me
in
perturbation
for
poor
william
adolphus
in
i
know
not
what
for
victoria
the
time
passed
on
there
is
but
one
incident
that
stands
out
naming
against
the
gray
of
that
monotony
the
full
meaning
of
it
i
did
not
understand
then
but
now
i
know
it
better
i
was
sitting
alone
in
my
i
had
sent
baptiste
to
bed
and
was
reading
a
book
with
interest
suddenly
the
door
was
opened
violently
before
i
could
even
rise
to
my
feet
victoria
the
door
slammed
behind
her
had
thrown
herself
on
her
knees
before
me
she
was
in
her
nightdress
barefooted
her
hair
loose
and
tumbled
on
her
shoulders
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
sprung
up
from
her
bed
and
run
to
me
she
caught
my
arms
in
her
hands
and
laid
her
face
on
my
knees
she
said
nothing
but
sobbed
violently
with
a
terrible
gasping
rapidity
my
god
what
the
matter
said
i
for
a
moment
there
was
no
answer
then
her
voice
came
interrupted
and
by
constant
sobs
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
do
it
for
god
sake
do
make
me
do
it
do
what
i
asked
her
sobs
alone
answered
me
and
their
answer
was
enough
i
sat
there
helpless
and
still
the
nervous
tight
clutching
of
her
hands
pinning
my
arms
to
my
side
you
the
king
you
the
king
she
moaned
yes
i
was
the
king
even
then
i
smiled
you
do
know
she
went
on
and
now
she
raised
her
face
streaming
with
tears
you
do
know
how
can
you
know
what
it
is
help
me
help
me
augustin
the
thing
had
come
on
me
with
utter
suddenness
the
tranquillity
of
my
quiet
room
had
been
rudely
rent
by
the
invasion
i
was
in
an
instant
face
to
face
with
a
strange
dim
tragedy
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
known
the
stress
of
which
i
could
never
fully
know
but
all
the
tenderness
that
i
had
for
her
my
love
for
her
beauty
and
the
yearning
for
comradeship
that
she
herself
had
choked
rose
in
me
i
bent
my
head
till
my
lips
rested
on
her
hair
crying
do
darling
do
she
sprang
up
throwing
her
arm
about
my
neck
and
looking
round
the
room
as
though
there
were
something
that
she
feared
then
she
sat
on
my
knee
and
nestled
close
to
me
she
had
ceased
to
sob
now
but
it
was
worse
to
me
to
see
her
face
strained
in
silent
agony
and
her
eyes
wept
dry
of
tears
let
me
stay
here
do
let
me
stay
here
a
little
she
said
as
i
passed
my
arm
round
her
and
her
head
fell
on
my
shoulder
do
send
me
away
yet
augustin
she
whispered
i
do
want
to
be
alone
stay
here
dearest
nobody
shall
hurt
you
said
i
as
i
kissed
her
my
heart
broke
for
her
trouble
but
it
was
sweet
to
me
to
think
that
she
had
fled
from
it
to
my
arms
after
all
the
old
bond
held
between
us
the
tug
of
trouble
revealed
it
she
lay
a
while
quite
still
with
closed
eyes
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
me
must
i
she
asked
no
i
answered
if
you
will
not
you
shall
not
her
arm
coiled
closer
round
my
neck
and
she
closed
her
eyes
again
sighing
and
moving
restlessly
presently
she
lay
very
quiet
her
exhaustion
seeming
like
sleep
how
long
had
she
tormented
herself
before
she
came
to
me
my
brain
was
busy
but
my
heart
outran
it
now
now
if
ever
i
would
assert
myself
my
power
my
position
she
should
not
call
to
me
in
vain
what
i
would
do
i
did
not
know
but
the
thing
she
dreaded
should
not
be
but
although
i
was
in
this
fever
i
did
not
stir
she
was
resting
in
peace
let
her
rest
as
long
as
she
would
for
more
than
an
hour
she
lay
there
in
my
arms
i
grew
stiff
and
very
weary
but
i
did
not
move
at
last
i
believe
that
in
very
truth
she
slept
the
clock
in
the
tower
struck
midnight
and
the
quarter
and
the
i
had
rehearsed
what
i
should
say
to
my
mother
and
what
to
hammerfeldt
i
had
dreamed
how
this
night
should
knit
her
and
me
so
closely
that
we
could
never
again
drift
apart
that
now
we
knew
one
another
and
for
each
of
us
what
was
superficial
in
the
other
existed
no
more
but
was
swept
away
by
the
flood
of
full
sympathy
she
and
i
against
the
world
if
need
be
a
shiver
ran
through
her
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
wider
looking
round
the
room
no
longer
in
fear
but
in
a
sort
of
wonder
her
gaze
rested
an
instant
on
my
face
she
drew
her
arm
from
round
my
neck
and
rose
to
her
feet
pushing
away
my
arm
there
she
stood
for
a
moment
with
a
strange
fretful
ashamed
look
on
her
face
she
tossed
her
head
flinging
her
hair
back
behind
her
shoulders
i
had
taken
her
hand
and
still
held
it
now
she
drew
it
also
away
what
must
you
think
of
me
she
said
good
gracious
i
in
my
nightgown
she
walked
across
to
the
and
stood
opposite
to
it
what
a
fright
i
look
she
said
how
long
have
i
been
here
i
do
know
more
than
an
hour
it
was
horrid
in
bed
she
said
in
a
yet
way
i
got
thinking
about
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
i
was
frightened
the
change
in
her
mood
sealed
my
lips
i
hope
mother
has
noticed
that
my
room
empty
no
of
course
not
she
must
be
in
bed
long
ago
will
you
take
me
back
to
my
room
augustin
yes
said
i
she
came
up
to
me
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
then
bent
down
to
me
as
i
sat
in
my
chair
and
kissed
my
forehead
you
a
dear
boy
she
said
was
i
quite
mad
i
meant
what
i
said
i
declared
as
i
stood
up
i
mean
it
still
ah
said
she
flinging
her
hands
out
poor
augustin
you
mean
it
still
take
me
along
the
corridor
dear
i
afraid
to
go
alone
sometimes
i
blame
myself
that
i
submitted
to
the
second
mood
as
completely
as
i
had
responded
to
the
first
but
i
was
staggered
by
the
change
and
the
old
sense
of
distance
scattered
for
an
hour
was
enveloping
me
again
one
protest
i
made
are
we
to
do
nothing
then
i
asked
in
a
low
whisper
we
to
go
to
our
beds
like
good
children
said
she
with
a
mournful
little
smile
come
take
me
to
mine
i
must
see
you
in
the
morning
in
the
morning
well
we
see
come
come
now
she
was
urgent
and
i
did
as
she
bade
me
but
first
she
made
me
bring
her
a
pair
of
my
slippers
her
feet
were
very
cold
she
said
and
they
felt
like
ice
against
my
hand
as
i
touched
them
in
putting
on
the
slippers
for
her
she
passed
her
hand
through
my
arm
and
we
went
together
the
door
of
her
room
stood
wide
open
we
went
in
i
saw
the
bed
in
confusion
fancy
if
any
one
had
come
by
and
seen
she
whispered
now
dear
i
opened
my
lips
to
speak
to
her
again
no
no
go
please
go
dear
i
left
her
standing
in
the
middle
of
her
room
outside
the
door
i
waited
many
minutes
i
heard
her
moving
about
and
getting
into
bed
then
all
was
quiet
i
returned
to
my
own
room
i
was
up
early
the
next
morning
for
i
had
been
able
to
sleep
but
little
i
wanted
above
all
things
to
see
victoria
again
but
even
while
i
was
dressing
baptiste
brought
me
a
note
i
opened
it
hurriedly
for
it
was
from
her
i
read
forget
all
about
last
night
i
was
tired
and
ill
i
rely
on
your
honour
to
say
nothing
to
anybody
i
am
all
right
this
morning
she
was
entitled
to
ask
the
pledge
of
my
honour
if
she
chose
i
tore
the
note
in
fragments
and
burned
them
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
morning
when
i
went
out
into
the
garden
there
was
a
group
on
the
terrace
my
mother
victoria
and
william
adolphus
they
were
laughing
and
talking
and
seemed
very
merry
as
a
rule
i
should
have
waved
a
good
morning
and
passed
on
for
my
solitary
walk
i
went
up
to
them
my
mother
appeared
to
be
in
an
excellent
temper
the
prince
looked
quite
easy
and
happy
victoria
was
a
little
pale
but
very
vivacious
she
darted
a
quick
look
at
me
and
cried
out
the
moment
i
had
kissed
my
mother
we
settling
the
bridesmaids
you
just
in
time
to
help
augustin
we
settled
the
bridesmaids
i
hardly
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
during
this
important
operation
victoria
was
very
kind
to
her
receiving
his
suggestions
with
positive
graciousness
he
became
radiant
under
this
treatment
when
our
task
was
done
victoria
passed
her
arm
through
his
declaring
that
she
wanted
a
stroll
in
the
woods
as
they
went
by
me
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
and
affectionately
on
my
arm
looking
me
full
in
the
face
the
while
i
understood
for
good
or
evil
my
lips
were
sealed
my
mother
looked
after
the
betrothed
couple
as
they
walked
away
i
looked
at
my
mother
fine
resolute
face
i
so
glad
said
she
at
last
to
see
victoria
so
happy
i
was
afraid
at
one
time
that
she
never
take
to
it
of
course
we
had
other
hopes
the
last
words
were
a
hit
at
me
i
ignored
them
that
battle
had
been
fought
the
victory
won
and
paid
for
by
me
in
handsome
fashion
has
she
taken
to
it
i
asked
as
carelessly
as
i
could
but
my
eyes
turned
keenly
on
me
have
you
any
reason
for
thinking
she
has
came
in
quick
question
no
i
answered
the
sun
was
shining
and
princess
heinrich
opened
her
parasol
very
leisurely
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
then
in
a
smooth
even
and
what
i
may
call
reasonable
voice
she
remarked
my
dear
augustin
from
time
to
time
all
girls
have
fancies
we
mothers
know
that
it
does
do
to
pay
any
attention
to
them
they
soon
go
if
they
let
alone
we
shall
meet
at
lunch
i
hope
i
bowed
respectfully
but
perhaps
i
looked
a
little
doubtful
it
really
does
do
to
take
any
notice
of
them
said
my
mother
over
her
shoulder
so
we
took
no
notice
of
them
my
sister
midnight
flight
to
my
room
and
to
my
arms
was
between
her
and
me
and
for
all
the
world
as
though
it
has
never
been
save
that
it
left
behind
it
a
little
legacy
of
renewed
kindliness
and
trust
for
that
much
i
was
thankful
but
i
could
not
forget
the
rest
a
month
later
she
was
married
to
william
adolphus
at
forstadt
chapter
viii
destiny
in
a
pinafore
the
foreign
tour
i
undertook
in
my
eighteenth
year
has
been
sufficiently
or
even
more
than
sufficiently
described
by
the
accomplished
and
courtly
pen
of
vohrenlorf
secretary
i
travelled
as
the
count
of
artenberg
under
my
governor
guidance
and
saw
in
some
ways
more
in
some
respects
less
than
most
young
men
on
their
travels
are
likely
to
see
old
hammerfeldt
recommended
for
my
reading
the
english
letters
of
lord
chesterfield
to
his
son
and
i
studied
them
with
some
profit
much
amusement
and
an
occasional
burst
of
impatience
i
believe
that
in
the
prince
opinion
i
like
stanhope
had
hitherto
attached
too
little
importance
to
and
not
attained
enough
proficiency
in
the
graces
concealment
was
the
life
breath
of
his
statescraft
and
the
graces
help
a
man
to
hide
everything
ideals
emotions
passions
his
very
soul
it
must
have
been
an
immense
satisfaction
to
the
prince
on
leaving
the
world
at
a
ripe
age
to
feel
that
nobody
had
ever
been
sure
that
they
understood
him
except
of
course
the
fools
who
think
that
they
understood
everybody
as
far
as
my
private
life
is
concerned
one
incident
only
on
this
expedition
is
of
moment
we
paid
a
visit
to
my
father
cousins
the
bartensteins
who
possessed
a
singularly
charming
place
in
tirol
the
duke
was
moderately
rich
very
able
and
very
indolent
he
was
a
connoisseur
in
music
and
the
arts
his
wife
my
cousin
elizabeth
was
a
very
woman
of
seven
or
eight
and
thirty
noted
for
her
dairy
and
fond
of
pursuits
her
devotion
to
these
last
had
resulted
in
her
complexion
being
rather
reddened
and
we
were
to
stay
a
week
an
unusually
long
halt
and
even
before
we
arrived
i
detected
a
simple
slyness
in
my
good
vohrenlorf
demeanour
when
a
secret
was
afoot
vohrenlorf
first
apparent
effort
was
to
draw
everybody
attention
to
the
fact
of
its
existence
out
of
perversity
i
asked
no
questions
and
left
him
to
seethe
in
his
mystery
i
knew
that
i
should
be
enlightened
soon
enough
i
was
quite
right
before
i
had
been
a
day
with
my
relatives
it
became
obvious
that
elsa
was
the
mystery
i
suppose
that
it
is
not
altogether
a
common
thing
for
a
youth
of
eighteen
feeling
himself
a
man
trying
to
think
himself
one
just
become
fully
conscious
of
the
power
and
attraction
of
the
women
he
meets
to
be
shown
a
child
of
twelve
and
given
to
understand
that
in
six
years
time
she
will
be
ready
to
become
his
wife
the
position
even
if
not
as
uncommon
as
i
suppose
is
curious
enough
to
justify
a
few
words
of
description
i
saw
elsa
first
as
she
was
rolling
down
a
hill
with
a
scandalized
governess
in
full
chase
elsa
rolled
quickly
marking
her
progress
by
triumphant
cries
she
brought
up
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
in
an
excessively
crumpled
state
her
short
skirts
were
being
smoothed
down
when
her
mother
and
i
arrived
she
was
a
pretty
fair
child
with
a
natural
merriment
about
her
attractive
enough
she
was
well
made
having
escaped
the
square
solidity
of
figure
that
characterized
cousin
elizabeth
her
features
were
still
in
an
undeveloped
condition
and
her
hair
brushed
smooth
and
plastered
down
on
her
forehead
was
tormented
into
ringlets
behind
she
looked
at
my
lanky
form
with
some
apprehension
was
it
a
good
roll
elsa
i
asked
splendid
she
answered
you
did
know
cousin
augustin
was
looking
on
did
you
asked
her
mother
no
i
did
but
it
was
plain
that
she
did
not
care
either
i
felt
that
cousin
elizabeth
honest
eyes
were
searching
my
face
give
me
a
kiss
wo
you
elsa
i
asked
elsa
turned
her
chubby
cheek
up
to
me
in
a
perfection
of
indifference
in
fact
both
elsa
and
i
were
performing
family
duties
thus
we
kissed
for
the
first
time
now
go
and
let
nurse
put
on
a
clean
frock
for
you
said
cousin
elizabeth
you
to
come
downstairs
and
you
not
fit
to
be
seen
do
roll
any
more
when
you
changed
your
frock
elsa
smiled
shook
her
head
and
ran
off
i
gathered
the
impression
that
even
in
the
clean
frock
she
would
roll
again
if
she
chanced
to
be
disposed
to
that
exercise
the
air
of
bartenstein
was
not
the
air
of
artenberg
a
milder
climate
reigned
there
was
no
styrian
discipline
for
elsa
i
believe
that
in
all
her
life
she
did
at
her
parents
instance
only
one
thing
that
she
seriously
disliked
cousin
elizabeth
and
i
walked
on
she
a
baby
still
said
cousin
elizabeth
presently
but
i
assure
you
that
she
has
begun
to
develop
there
no
hurry
is
there
no
you
know
i
think
you
too
old
for
your
age
augustin
i
suppose
it
was
inevitable
i
felt
much
younger
in
many
ways
than
i
had
at
fifteen
the
gates
of
the
world
were
opening
and
showing
me
prospects
unknown
to
the
lonely
boy
at
artenberg
and
she
has
the
sweetest
disposition
so
loving
said
cousin
elizabeth
i
did
not
find
anything
appropriate
to
answer
the
next
day
found
me
fully
although
delicately
apprised
of
the
situation
it
seemed
to
me
a
strange
one
the
duke
was
guarded
in
his
hints
and
profuse
of
declarations
that
it
was
too
soon
to
think
of
anything
good
cousin
elizabeth
strove
to
conceal
her
eagerness
and
repress
the
haste
born
of
it
by
similar
but
more
clumsy
speeches
i
spoke
openly
on
the
subject
to
vohrenlorf
ah
well
even
if
it
should
be
so
you
have
six
years
he
reminded
me
in
consolation
and
she
will
grow
up
she
wo
roll
down
hills
always
of
course
i
answered
rather
peevishly
in
truth
the
thing
would
not
assume
an
appearance
of
reality
for
me
it
was
too
utterly
opposed
to
the
current
of
my
thoughts
and
dreams
a
boy
of
my
age
will
readily
contemplate
marriage
with
a
woman
ten
years
his
senior
in
regard
to
a
child
six
years
younger
than
himself
the
idea
seems
absurd
yet
i
did
not
put
it
from
me
i
had
been
well
tutored
in
the
strength
of
family
arrangements
and
the
force
of
destiny
had
been
brought
home
to
me
on
several
occasions
i
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
my
visit
to
bartenstein
was
part
of
a
deliberate
plan
the
person
who
contrived
my
meeting
with
elsa
had
a
shrewd
knowledge
of
my
character
he
knew
that
ideas
long
present
in
my
mind
became
as
it
were
domiciled
there
and
were
hard
to
expel
i
discovered
afterward
without
surprise
that
the
stay
with
my
relatives
was
added
to
my
tour
at
prince
von
hammerfeldt
suggestion
many
men
or
youths
bordering
on
manhood
have
seen
their
future
brides
in
short
frocks
and
unmitigated
childhood
but
they
have
not
been
aware
of
what
was
before
them
i
was
at
once
amused
and
distressed
my
humour
was
touched
but
life
avenue
seemed
shortened
even
if
it
were
not
elsa
it
would
be
some
other
little
girl
now
playing
with
her
toys
and
rolling
down
banks
imagination
was
not
elastic
enough
to
leap
over
the
years
and
behold
the
child
transformed
i
stuck
in
the
present
and
was
whimsically
apprehensive
of
a
child
seen
through
a
magnifying
glass
larger
but
unchanged
in
form
air
and
raiment
was
this
my
fate
and
for
it
i
must
wait
till
the
perfected
beauties
who
had
smiled
on
me
passed
on
to
other
men
and
with
them
grew
old
aye
as
it
seemed
quite
old
i
felt
myself
ludicrously
reduced
to
elsa
status
a
long
boy
who
had
outgrown
his
clothes
and
yet
was
no
nearer
to
a
man
my
trouble
was
perhaps
unreasonably
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
elsa
did
not
take
to
me
i
did
my
best
to
be
pleasant
i
made
her
several
gifts
she
accepted
my
offerings
but
was
not
bought
by
them
myself
she
considered
dull
i
had
not
the
flow
of
animal
spirits
that
appeals
so
strongly
to
children
i
played
with
her
but
her
young
keenness
detected
the
cloven
hoof
of
duty
she
told
me
i
need
not
play
unless
i
liked
cousin
elizabeth
apologized
for
me
elsa
was
gentle
but
did
not
change
her
opinion
the
passage
of
years
i
reflected
would
increase
in
me
all
that
the
child
found
least
to
her
taste
i
was
as
i
have
said
unable
to
picture
her
with
tastes
changed
but
a
failure
of
imagination
may
occasionally
issue
in
paradoxical
rightness
for
the
imagination
relies
on
the
common
run
of
events
which
the
peculiar
case
may
chance
to
contradict
as
a
fact
i
do
not
think
that
elsa
ever
did
change
greatly
i
began
to
be
sorry
for
her
as
well
as
for
myself
considered
as
an
outlook
in
life
as
the
governing
factor
in
a
human
being
existence
i
did
not
seem
to
myself
brilliant
or
even
satisfactory
i
had
at
this
time
remarkable
forecasts
of
feelings
that
were
in
later
years
to
be
my
almost
daily
companions
and
what
shall
your
husband
be
like
elsa
asked
the
duke
as
his
little
daughter
sat
on
his
knee
and
he
played
with
her
ringlets
i
was
sitting
by
and
the
duke
eyes
twinkled
discreetly
the
child
looked
across
to
me
and
studied
my
appearance
for
some
few
moments
then
she
gave
us
a
simple
but
completely
lucid
description
of
a
gentleman
differing
from
myself
in
all
outward
characteristics
and
in
all
such
inward
traits
as
elsa
experience
and
vocabulary
enabled
her
to
touch
upon
i
learned
later
that
she
took
hints
from
a
tall
grenadier
who
sometimes
stood
sentry
at
the
castle
at
the
moment
it
seemed
as
though
her
ideal
were
well
enough
delineated
by
the
picture
of
my
opposite
the
duke
laughed
and
i
laughed
also
elsa
was
very
grave
and
in
defining
her
requirements
her
inclinations
have
never
been
obscure
to
her
even
then
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
she
wanted
and
i
was
not
that
by
the
indiscretion
of
somebody
the
duke
said
his
wife
his
wife
said
the
governess
the
governess
said
the
nurse
on
the
day
before
i
went
elsa
got
a
hint
of
her
suggested
future
indeed
it
was
more
than
a
hint
it
was
enough
to
entangle
her
in
excitement
interest
and
i
must
add
dismay
children
play
with
the
words
wife
and
husband
in
a
happy
ignorance
their
fairy
tales
give
and
restrict
their
knowledge
cousin
elizabeth
came
to
me
in
something
of
a
stir
she
was
afraid
that
i
should
be
annoyed
should
suspect
perhaps
a
forcing
of
my
hand
or
some
such
man≈ìuvre
but
i
was
not
annoyed
i
was
interested
to
learn
what
effect
the
prospect
had
upon
my
little
cousin
i
was
so
different
from
the
grenadier
so
irreconcilable
with
elsa
fancy
portrait
i
very
terribly
vexed
cried
cousin
elizabeth
when
it
all
so
all
no
more
than
an
idea
she
so
young
she
forget
all
about
it
said
i
soothingly
you
not
angry
oh
no
i
was
only
afflicted
with
a
sense
of
absurdity
chance
threw
me
in
elsa
way
that
afternoon
she
was
with
her
nurse
in
the
gardens
she
ran
up
to
me
at
once
but
stopped
about
a
yard
from
the
seat
on
which
i
was
sitting
i
became
the
victim
of
a
grave
searching
and
long
inspection
there
was
a
roundness
of
surprise
in
her
baby
blue
eyes
embarrassed
and
amused
i
am
inclined
sometimes
to
think
that
more
than
half
my
life
has
been
a
mixture
of
these
not
implacable
enemies
i
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
i
thin
and
sallow
and
and
i
ca
sing
and
i
laugh
in
a
jolly
way
and
i
ca
fly
kites
said
i
having
the
description
of
her
ideal
in
my
mind
you
would
like
me
to
be
your
husband
would
you
elsa
unlike
myself
was
neither
embarrassed
nor
amused
the
mild
and
interested
gravity
of
her
face
persisted
unchanged
i
do
know
she
said
meditatively
with
most
of
the
faults
that
can
beset
one
of
my
station
i
do
not
plead
guilty
to
any
excessive
degree
of
vainglory
i
was
flattered
that
the
child
hesitated
then
you
like
me
rather
i
asked
yes
rather
she
paused
and
then
added
if
i
married
you
i
should
be
queen
should
i
cousin
augustin
yes
i
assured
her
i
should
think
that
rather
nice
is
it
it
is
any
particular
fun
being
king
said
i
in
a
burst
of
confidence
is
it
she
asked
her
eyes
growing
rounder
still
i
think
i
should
like
it
her
tone
was
quite
confident
even
at
that
age
as
i
have
observed
she
knew
very
well
what
she
liked
for
my
part
i
remembered
so
vividly
my
own
early
dreams
and
later
awakenings
that
i
would
not
cut
short
her
guileless
visions
moreover
to
generalize
from
one
self
is
the
most
fatal
foolishness
even
while
it
is
the
most
inevitable
during
the
remaining
hours
of
my
visit
elsa
treated
me
i
must
not
say
with
more
affection
but
certainly
with
more
attention
she
was
interested
in
me
i
had
become
to
her
a
source
of
possibilities
dim
to
vision
but
gorgeous
to
imagination
i
knew
so
well
the
images
that
floated
before
a
childish
mind
able
to
gape
at
them
only
half
able
to
grasp
them
i
had
been
through
this
stage
it
is
odd
to
reflect
that
i
was
in
an
unlike
but
almost
equally
great
delusion
myself
i
had
ceased
to
expect
immoderate
enjoyment
from
my
position
but
i
had
conceived
an
exaggerated
idea
of
its
power
and
influence
on
the
world
and
mankind
of
this
mistake
i
was
then
unconscious
i
smiled
to
think
that
elsa
could
play
at
being
a
queen
the
doll
the
bolster
the
dog
or
whatever
else
might
chance
to
come
handy
acting
the
regal
in
my
place
i
do
not
now
altogether
quarrel
with
my
substitutes
the
hour
of
departure
came
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
cousin
elizabeth
overwhelming
tact
she
was
so
anxious
that
i
should
not
exaggerate
the
meaning
or
importance
of
the
suggestion
which
had
been
made
that
she
succeeded
in
filling
my
mind
with
it
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
the
duke
having
tried
in
vain
to
stop
her
fell
into
silence
cigarettes
and
drolly
resigned
glances
but
he
caught
me
alone
for
a
few
moments
and
gave
me
his
word
of
advice
think
no
more
about
this
nonsense
for
six
years
said
he
the
women
will
you
know
i
promised
with
a
laugh
not
to
anticipate
troubles
he
smiled
at
my
phrase
but
did
not
dispute
its
justice
i
think
he
shared
the
sort
of
regret
which
i
felt
that
such
things
should
be
so
much
as
talked
about
in
connection
with
elsa
a
man
keeps
that
feeling
about
his
daughter
long
after
her
mother
has
marked
a
husband
and
chosen
a
priest
my
visit
to
my
cousins
was
the
last
stage
of
my
journey
from
their
house
vohrenlorf
and
i
travelled
through
to
forstadt
i
was
received
at
the
railway
station
by
a
large
and
distinguished
company
my
mother
was
at
artenberg
where
i
was
to
join
her
that
evening
but
hammerfeldt
awaited
me
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
attached
to
the
court
i
was
too
much
given
to
introspection
and
not
to
be
aware
that
my
experiences
had
given
me
a
lift
toward
manhood
my
shyness
was
smothered
though
not
killed
by
a
kind
of
mechanical
ease
born
of
practice
after
greeting
hammerfeldt
i
received
the
welcome
of
the
company
with
a
composed
courtesy
of
which
the
prince
approval
was
very
manifest
ceremonial
occasions
such
as
these
are
worthy
of
record
and
meditation
only
when
they
surround
and
as
it
were
frame
some
incident
really
material
such
an
incident
occurred
now
my
inner
mind
was
still
full
of
my
sojourn
with
the
bartensteins
of
the
pathetic
whimsical
hypothetical
connection
between
little
elsa
and
myself
and
of
the
chains
that
seemed
to
bind
my
life
in
bonds
not
of
my
making
these
reflections
went
on
in
an
undercurrent
while
i
was
bowing
saluting
grasping
hands
listening
and
responding
to
appropriate
observations
suddenly
i
found
the
count
von
sempach
before
me
his
name
brought
back
my
mind
in
an
instant
from
its
wanderings
the
countess
was
recalled
very
vividly
to
my
recollection
i
asked
after
her
sempach
much
gratified
pointed
to
a
row
of
ladies
who
the
occasion
being
official
stood
somewhat
in
the
background
there
she
was
now
in
the
maturity
of
her
remarkable
beauty
seeming
to
me
the
embodiment
of
perfect
accomplishment
i
saluted
her
with
marked
graciousness
fifty
heads
turned
instantly
from
me
toward
her
she
blushed
very
slightly
and
curtseyed
very
low
sempach
murmured
gratification
hammerfeldt
smiled
i
was
vaguely
conscious
of
a
subdued
sensation
running
all
through
the
company
but
my
mind
was
occupied
with
the
contrast
between
this
finished
woman
and
the
little
girl
i
had
left
behind
from
feeling
old
too
old
sad
and
knowing
for
poor
little
elsa
i
was
suddenly
transported
into
an
oppressive
consciousness
of
youth
and
rawness
involuntarily
i
drew
myself
up
to
my
full
height
and
assumed
the
best
air
of
dignity
that
was
at
my
command
so
posed
i
crossed
the
station
to
my
carriage
between
hammerfeldt
and
vohrenlorf
your
time
has
not
been
wasted
old
hammerfeldt
whispered
to
me
you
are
ready
now
to
take
up
what
i
am
more
than
ready
to
lay
down
i
started
slightly
i
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
that
the
council
of
regency
was
now
discharged
of
its
office
and
that
i
was
to
assume
the
full
burden
of
my
responsibilities
i
had
looked
forward
to
this
time
with
eagerness
and
ambition
but
a
man
emotions
at
a
given
moment
are
very
seldom
what
he
has
expected
them
to
be
some
foreign
thought
intrudes
and
predominates
something
accidental
supplants
what
has
seemed
so
appropriate
and
certain
while
i
travelled
down
to
artenberg
that
evening
with
vohrenlorf
opposite
to
me
vohrenlorf
who
himself
was
about
to
lay
down
his
functions
the
assumption
of
full
power
was
not
what
occupied
my
mind
i
was
engrossed
with
thoughts
of
elsa
with
fancies
about
my
countess
with
strange
dim
speculations
that
touched
me
the
young
man
not
the
king
about
whom
all
the
coil
was
had
i
been
called
upon
to
condense
those
vague
meditations
and
emotions
into
a
sentence
i
would
have
borrowed
what
vohrenlorf
had
said
to
me
when
we
were
with
the
bartensteins
he
did
not
often
hit
the
nail
exactly
on
the
head
but
just
now
i
could
give
no
better
summary
of
all
i
felt
than
his
soberly
optimistic
reminder
ah
well
even
if
it
should
be
so
you
have
six
years
the
thought
that
i
treasured
on
the
way
to
artenberg
that
evening
was
the
thought
of
my
six
years
chapter
ix
just
what
would
happen
soon
after
my
return
my
mother
and
i
went
into
residence
at
forstadt
my
time
was
divided
between
mastering
my
public
duties
under
tuition
and
playing
a
prominent
part
in
the
gaieties
of
the
capital
just
now
i
was
on
cordial
if
not
exactly
intimate
terms
with
the
princess
she
appeared
to
have
resigned
herself
to
preponderating
influence
in
political
affairs
and
to
accept
in
compensation
the
office
of
mentor
and
guide
in
all
social
matters
i
was
happy
in
the
establishment
of
a
which
left
me
tolerably
free
from
the
harassing
trifles
of
ceremonial
and
etiquette
to
hammerfeldt
instructions
i
listened
with
avidity
and
showed
a
deference
which
did
not
forbid
secret
criticism
he
worked
me
hard
the
truth
is
and
it
was
not
then
hidden
either
from
him
or
from
me
that
his
strength
was
failing
age
had
not
bent
but
it
threatened
to
break
him
the
time
was
short
in
which
he
could
hope
to
be
by
my
side
binding
his
principles
and
rivetting
his
methods
on
me
he
was
too
shrewd
not
to
detect
in
me
a
curiosity
of
intellect
that
only
the
strongest
and
deepest
prepossessions
could
restrain
these
it
was
his
untiring
effort
to
create
in
my
mind
and
to
buttress
till
they
were
impregnable
to
some
extent
he
attained
his
object
but
his
success
was
limited
and
his
teaching
affected
by
what
i
can
only
call
a
modernness
of
temperament
in
me
which
no
force
of
tradition
wholly
destroyed
or
stifled
that
many
things
must
be
treated
as
beyond
question
was
the
fruit
of
his
maxims
it
is
a
position
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
adopt
with
me
the
acid
of
doubt
bit
into
every
axiom
i
took
pleasure
in
the
society
and
arguments
of
the
liberal
politicians
and
journalists
who
began
to
frequent
the
court
as
soon
as
a
rumour
of
my
inclinations
spread
i
became
the
centre
and
object
of
a
contention
between
the
right
and
the
left
between
conservative
and
liberal
forces
or
if
i
apply
to
each
party
the
nickname
accorded
to
it
by
the
enemy
between
the
reaction
and
the
revolution
doubtless
all
this
will
find
an
accomplished
and
possibly
an
impartial
historian
its
significance
for
these
personal
memoirs
is
due
chiefly
to
the
accidental
fact
that
whereas
my
mother
was
the
social
centre
of
the
orthodox
party
and
in
that
capacity
gave
solid
aid
to
hammerfeldt
the
unorthodox
gathered
round
the
countess
von
sempach
her
husband
was
considered
no
more
than
a
good
soldier
a
man
of
high
rank
and
a
devoted
husband
by
her
own
talents
and
charm
this
remarkable
woman
although
a
foreigner
had
achieved
for
herself
a
position
of
great
influence
she
renewed
the
glories
of
the
political
in
forstadt
but
she
never
talked
politics
eminent
men
discussed
deep
secrets
with
one
another
in
her
rooms
she
was
content
to
please
their
taste
without
straining
their
intellects
or
seeking
to
rival
them
in
argument
by
the
abdication
of
a
doubtful
claim
she
reigned
absolute
in
her
own
dominion
it
was
from
studying
her
that
i
first
learned
both
how
is
the
inspiration
of
a
woman
personality
and
how
it
gathers
and
conserves
strength
by
remaining
within
its
own
boundaries
and
refusing
alien
conquests
the
men
of
the
princess
party
from
hammerfeldt
downward
were
sometimes
impatient
of
her
suggestions
and
attempted
control
the
countess
friends
were
never
aware
that
they
received
suggestions
and
imagined
themselves
to
exercise
control
i
think
that
the
old
prince
was
almost
alone
in
penetrating
the
secret
of
the
real
power
his
charming
enemy
exercised
and
the
extent
of
it
they
were
very
cordial
to
one
another
madame
he
said
to
her
once
you
might
convince
me
of
anything
if
i
were
not
too
old
why
prince
she
cried
you
are
not
going
to
pretend
that
your
mind
has
grown
old
no
countess
my
feelings
he
replied
with
a
smile
her
answer
was
a
blush
this
was
told
to
me
by
wetter
a
young
and
very
brilliant
journalist
who
had
once
given
me
lessons
in
philosophy
and
with
whom
i
maintained
a
friendship
in
spite
of
his
politics
he
reminded
me
now
and
then
of
geoffrey
owen
but
his
enthusiasm
was
of
a
dryer
sort
not
humanity
but
the
abstract
idea
of
progress
inspired
him
not
the
abolition
of
individual
suffering
but
the
perfecting
of
his
logical
conceptions
in
the
sphere
of
politics
was
his
stimulating
hope
and
there
was
in
him
a
strong
alloy
of
personal
ambition
and
a
stronger
of
personal
passion
rather
to
my
surprise
hammerfeldt
showed
no
uneasiness
at
my
friendship
with
him
i
joked
once
on
the
subject
and
he
answered
wetter
only
appeals
to
your
intellect
sire
there
i
am
not
afraid
now
his
answer
denying
one
apprehension
hinted
another
it
will
cause
no
surprise
that
i
had
renewed
an
old
acquaintance
with
the
countess
and
had
been
present
at
a
dinner
in
her
house
more
than
this
i
fell
into
the
habit
of
attending
her
receptions
on
wednesdays
on
this
night
all
parties
were
welcome
and
the
gathering
was
by
way
of
being
strictly
strictly
also
were
the
calls
that
i
made
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
when
she
would
recall
our
earlier
meetings
our
glances
exchanged
our
thoughts
of
one
another
and
lead
me
to
talk
of
my
boyhood
these
things
did
not
appeal
only
to
the
intellect
of
a
youth
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
when
they
proceeded
from
the
lips
of
a
beautiful
and
brilliant
woman
of
i
approach
a
very
common
occurrence
but
in
my
case
its
progress
and
result
were
specially
modified
and
conditioned
there
was
the
political
aspect
looming
large
to
the
alarmed
right
there
was
the
struggle
for
more
intimate
influence
over
me
in
which
my
mother
fought
with
a
grim
intensity
in
my
own
mind
there
was
always
the
curious
dim
presence
of
an
inexorable
fate
that
wore
the
incongruous
mask
of
elsa
baby
face
all
these
were
present
to
me
in
their
full
force
during
the
earlier
period
of
my
friendship
with
the
countess
when
i
was
still
concealing
from
myself
as
well
as
from
her
and
all
the
world
that
i
could
ever
desire
to
have
more
than
friendship
the
first
stages
past
there
came
a
time
when
the
secret
was
still
kept
from
all
save
myself
but
when
i
knew
it
with
an
exultation
not
to
be
conquered
with
a
dread
and
a
shame
that
tormented
while
they
could
not
prevail
but
i
went
more
and
more
to
her
house
i
had
no
evil
intent
nay
i
had
no
intent
at
all
in
my
going
i
could
not
keep
away
she
alone
had
come
to
satisfy
me
with
her
alone
all
of
me
thoughts
feelings
eyes
and
ears
seemed
to
find
some
cause
for
exercise
and
a
worthy
employment
of
their
life
the
other
presences
in
my
mind
grew
fainter
and
intermittent
in
their
visits
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
stream
and
floated
down
the
current
yet
i
was
never
altogether
forgetful
nor
blind
to
what
i
did
i
knew
the
transformation
that
had
come
over
my
friendship
to
myself
now
i
could
not
but
call
it
love
i
knew
that
others
in
the
palace
in
the
chancellery
in
in
newspaper
offices
ay
perhaps
even
in
the
very
street
called
it
now
not
the
king
friendship
nor
the
love
but
the
king
infatuation
not
even
then
could
i
lose
altogether
the
external
view
of
myself
we
were
sitting
by
the
fire
one
evening
in
the
twilight
she
was
playing
with
a
but
suffering
the
flames
to
paint
her
face
and
throw
into
relief
the
sensitive
merry
lips
and
the
eyes
so
full
of
varied
meanings
she
had
told
me
to
go
and
i
had
not
gone
she
leaned
back
and
after
one
glance
of
reproof
fixed
her
regard
on
the
polished
tip
of
her
shoe
that
rested
on
the
fender
she
meant
that
she
would
talk
no
more
to
me
that
in
her
estimation
since
i
had
no
business
to
stay
i
was
already
gone
an
impulse
seized
me
i
do
not
know
what
i
hoped
nor
why
that
moment
broke
the
silence
which
i
had
imposed
on
myself
but
i
told
her
about
the
little
fair
chubby
child
at
the
castle
of
bartenstein
i
watched
her
closely
but
her
eyes
never
strayed
from
her
well
she
had
never
said
a
word
that
showed
any
concern
in
such
a
matter
even
i
had
done
little
more
than
look
and
hint
and
come
illustration
the
firelight
played
on
the
hand
that
held
the
screen
it
as
if
they
meant
me
to
marry
tot√©
i
ended
tot√©
was
the
pet
name
by
which
we
called
her
own
daughter
the
countess
broke
her
wilful
silence
but
did
not
change
the
direction
of
her
eyes
if
tot√©
were
of
the
proper
station
she
said
ironically
she
be
just
right
for
you
by
the
time
you
both
grown
up
and
you
be
i
should
be
too
old
to
plague
you
i
should
just
sit
in
my
corner
in
the
sun
the
sun
is
always
in
your
corner
do
be
so
complimentary
she
said
with
a
sudden
twitching
of
her
lips
i
shall
have
to
stand
up
and
curtsey
and
i
do
want
to
besides
you
ought
to
know
how
to
say
things
like
that
ought
you
c√¶sar
c√¶sar
was
my
shall
i
say
used
when
we
were
alone
or
with
count
max
only
in
a
playful
satire
a
silence
followed
for
some
time
at
last
she
glanced
toward
me
not
gone
yet
said
she
raising
her
brows
what
will
the
princess
say
i
go
when
i
please
said
i
resenting
the
question
as
i
was
meant
to
resent
it
yes
certainly
not
when
i
please
our
eyes
met
now
suddenly
she
blushed
and
then
interposed
the
screen
between
herself
and
me
a
glorious
thrill
of
youthful
triumph
ran
through
me
she
had
paid
her
first
tribute
to
my
manhood
in
that
blush
the
offering
was
small
but
for
its
significance
frankincense
and
myrrh
to
me
i
thought
you
came
to
talk
about
wetter
bill
she
suggested
presently
in
a
voice
lower
than
her
usual
tones
the
deuce
take
wetter
bill
said
i
i
am
very
interested
in
it
just
now
even
just
now
c√¶sar
i
heard
a
little
laugh
behind
the
screen
hammerfeldt
hates
it
said
i
oh
then
that
settles
it
you
be
against
us
of
course
why
of
course
you
always
do
as
the
prince
tells
you
do
you
unless
somebody
more
powerful
forbids
me
who
is
more
powerful
except
c√¶sar
himself
i
made
no
answer
but
i
rose
and
crossing
the
rug
stood
by
her
i
remember
the
look
and
the
feel
of
the
room
very
well
she
lay
back
in
a
low
chair
upholstered
in
blue
the
firelight
forbidden
her
face
played
on
the
hand
that
held
the
screen
flushing
its
white
to
red
i
could
see
her
hair
gleaming
in
the
fantastically
varying
light
that
the
flames
gave
as
they
left
and
fell
i
was
in
a
tumult
of
excitement
and
timidity
more
powerful
than
c√¶sar
i
asked
and
my
voice
shook
do
call
yourself
c√¶sar
why
not
there
was
a
momentary
hesitation
before
the
answer
came
low
because
you
must
laugh
at
yourself
i
may
laugh
at
you
but
you
must
yourself
i
wondered
at
the
words
the
tone
the
strange
diffidence
that
infected
even
a
speech
so
full
of
her
gay
bravery
a
moment
later
she
added
a
reason
for
her
command
you
so
absurd
that
you
must
laugh
at
yourself
and
c√¶sar
if
you
stay
any
longer
or
come
again
soon
other
people
will
laugh
at
you
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
whether
she
meant
to
give
a
genuine
warning
or
to
strike
a
chord
that
should
sound
back
defiance
if
ten
thousand
of
them
laugh
what
is
it
to
me
they
dare
laugh
only
behind
my
back
i
said
she
laughed
before
my
face
the
screen
fell
and
she
laughed
saying
softly
c√¶sar
c√¶sar
i
was
wonderfully
happy
in
my
perturbation
the
great
charm
she
had
for
me
was
alloyed
less
than
ever
before
by
the
sense
of
rawness
which
she
above
all
others
could
compel
me
to
feel
she
herself
was
not
wholly
calm
not
mistress
of
herself
without
a
struggle
without
her
moments
of
faintness
yet
now
she
appeared
composed
again
and
there
was
nothing
but
merriment
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
gone
i
daresay
that
not
to
her
any
more
than
to
myself
could
i
seem
quite
like
an
ordinary
boy
perhaps
the
more
i
forgot
what
was
peculiar
about
me
the
more
she
remembered
it
my
oblivion
serving
to
point
her
triumph
and
the
princess
she
asked
laughing
still
but
now
again
a
little
nervously
my
exultation
finding
vent
in
mischief
and
impelled
by
curiosity
drove
me
to
a
venture
i
shall
tell
the
princess
that
i
kissed
you
said
i
the
countess
suddenly
sat
upright
and
that
you
kissed
me
several
times
i
continued
how
dare
you
she
cried
in
a
whisper
and
her
cheeks
flamed
in
blushes
and
in
firelight
my
little
device
was
a
triumph
i
began
to
laugh
oh
of
course
if
she
asks
me
when
i
added
i
shall
confess
that
it
was
ten
years
ago
many
emotions
mingled
in
my
companion
glance
as
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
she
was
indignant
at
the
trap
amused
at
having
been
caught
in
it
not
fully
relieved
from
embarrassment
not
wholly
convinced
that
the
explanation
of
my
daring
speech
covered
all
the
intent
with
which
it
had
been
uttered
perhaps
not
desirous
of
being
convinced
too
thoroughly
a
long
pause
followed
timidity
held
me
back
from
further
advance
for
that
evening
enough
seemed
to
have
passed
i
had
made
a
start
to
go
further
might
be
to
risk
all
i
was
about
to
take
my
leave
when
she
looked
up
again
saying
and
about
wetter
bill
c√¶sar
you
know
i
can
do
nothing
can
c√¶sar
do
nothing
if
you
were
known
to
favour
it
fifty
votes
would
be
changed
her
face
was
eager
and
animated
i
looked
down
at
her
and
smiled
she
flushed
again
and
cried
hastily
no
no
never
mind
at
least
not
i
suppose
that
my
smile
persisted
and
was
not
a
mirthful
one
it
stirred
anger
and
resentment
in
her
i
know
why
you
smiling
she
exclaimed
i
suppose
that
when
i
was
kind
to
you
as
a
baby
i
wanted
something
from
you
too
did
i
she
had
detected
the
thought
that
had
come
so
inevitably
into
my
mind
that
she
should
resent
it
so
passionately
almost
persuaded
me
of
its
injustice
i
turned
from
it
to
the
pleasant
memory
of
her
earlier
impulsive
kindness
i
put
out
my
hands
and
grasped
hers
she
let
me
hold
them
for
an
instant
and
then
drew
them
away
she
gave
rather
a
forced
laugh
you
too
young
to
be
bothered
about
bills
she
said
and
too
young
for
for
all
sorts
of
other
things
too
run
away
never
mind
me
with
my
bills
and
my
wrinkles
your
wrinkles
oh
if
not
now
in
a
year
or
two
by
the
time
you
ready
to
marry
elsa
as
she
spoke
she
rose
and
stood
facing
me
a
new
sense
of
her
beauty
came
over
me
her
beauty
tragedy
already
before
her
eyes
was
to
me
remote
and
impossible
because
it
was
not
yet
very
near
she
exaggerated
its
nearness
because
it
was
inevitable
i
turned
away
from
it
indeed
who
could
remember
seeing
her
then
who
save
herself
as
she
looked
on
my
youth
you
soon
be
old
and
ugly
i
asked
laughing
yes
soon
it
will
seem
very
soon
to
you
what
the
moral
said
i
she
laughed
uneasily
twisting
the
screen
in
her
hands
for
an
instant
she
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
and
as
they
dropped
again
she
whispered
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
my
hand
flew
out
to
her
again
she
took
it
and
after
a
laughing
glance
curtseyed
low
over
it
as
though
in
formal
farewell
i
had
not
meant
that
and
laughed
in
my
turn
i
sha
be
old
well
by
she
murmured
and
glanced
ostentatiously
at
the
clock
may
i
come
i
never
invite
you
shall
you
be
here
it
not
one
of
my
receiving
days
i
like
a
good
chance
better
than
a
poor
certainty
at
least
there
will
be
nobody
else
here
max
perhaps
i
do
think
so
you
do
think
so
what
do
you
mean
by
that
c√¶sar
no
i
do
want
to
know
i
believe
it
was
impertinent
are
you
going
yes
said
i
when
i
have
kissed
your
hand
she
said
nothing
but
held
it
out
to
me
she
smiled
but
there
seemed
to
me
to
be
pain
in
her
eyes
i
pressed
her
hand
to
my
lips
and
went
out
without
speaking
again
as
i
closed
the
door
i
heard
her
fling
herself
back
into
her
chair
with
a
curious
little
sound
i
left
the
house
quickly
and
silently
no
servant
was
summoned
to
escort
me
i
walked
a
few
yards
along
the
street
to
where
wetter
lived
my
carriage
was
ordered
to
come
for
me
at
wetter
it
had
not
yet
arrived
to
be
known
to
visit
wetter
was
to
accept
the
blame
of
a
smaller
indiscretion
as
the
price
of
hiding
a
greater
the
deputy
was
at
home
writing
in
his
study
he
received
me
with
an
admirable
unconsciousness
of
where
i
had
come
from
i
was
still
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
was
glad
to
sit
smoking
quietly
while
his
animated
fluent
talk
ran
on
he
was
full
of
this
bill
of
his
and
explained
its
provisions
to
me
with
the
air
of
desiring
that
i
should
understand
its
spirit
and
aim
and
of
being
willing
then
to
leave
it
to
my
candid
consideration
he
did
not
attempt
to
blink
the
difficulties
of
course
we
have
the
prince
and
all
the
party
of
reaction
against
us
he
said
but
your
majesty
is
not
a
member
of
any
party
not
even
of
yours
yet
said
i
with
a
laugh
he
laughed
in
his
turn
openly
and
merrily
i
a
poor
schemer
he
said
but
i
do
know
why
it
should
be
wrong
for
you
to
hear
my
views
any
more
than
hammerfeldt
the
servant
entered
and
announced
the
arrival
of
my
carriage
wetter
escorted
me
to
it
i
promise
not
to
mention
the
bill
if
you
honour
me
by
coming
again
sire
he
said
as
he
held
the
brougham
door
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
again
i
like
to
hear
about
it
i
answered
his
bow
and
smile
conveyed
absolutely
nothing
but
a
respectful
gratification
and
a
friendly
pleasure
yet
he
knew
that
the
situation
of
his
house
was
more
responsible
for
my
visit
than
the
interest
of
his
projects
in
part
i
saw
clear
enough
even
at
this
time
it
was
the
design
and
hope
of
wetter
and
his
friends
to
break
down
hammerfeldt
power
and
obtain
a
political
influence
over
me
hammerfeldt
political
dominance
seemed
to
them
to
be
based
on
a
personal
ascendency
this
they
must
contrive
to
match
their
instrument
was
not
far
to
seek
the
countess
was
ready
to
their
hand
a
beautiful
woman
sharpest
weapon
of
all
in
such
a
strife
they
put
her
forward
against
the
prince
in
the
fight
whereof
i
was
the
prize
all
this
i
saw
against
it
all
i
was
forewarned
and
forearmed
knowledge
gave
security
but
there
was
more
and
here
with
the
failure
of
insight
safety
was
compromised
what
was
her
mind
what
was
her
part
not
as
it
seemed
to
these
busy
politicians
but
as
her
own
heart
taught
it
her
here
came
to
me
the
excitement
of
uncertainty
the
impulse
of
youth
the
prick
of
vanity
the
longing
for
that
intimate
love
of
which
my
life
had
given
me
so
little
was
i
to
her
also
only
something
to
be
used
in
the
game
of
politics
a
tool
that
she
a
defter
tool
must
shape
and
point
before
it
could
be
of
use
i
tried
to
say
this
to
myself
and
to
make
a
barrier
of
the
knowledge
but
was
it
all
the
truth
remembering
her
eyes
and
tones
her
words
and
hesitations
i
could
not
accept
it
for
the
whole
truth
there
was
more
what
more
i
knew
not
even
if
there
had
been
no
more
i
was
falling
so
deep
into
the
gulf
of
passion
that
it
crossed
my
mind
to
take
while
i
gave
and
if
i
were
to
be
used
to
exact
my
hire
in
a
tumult
of
these
thoughts
embracing
now
what
in
the
next
moment
i
rejected
revolting
in
a
sudden
fear
from
the
plan
which
just
before
seemed
so
attractive
i
passed
the
evening
and
the
night
for
i
had
taken
up
that
mixed
heritage
of
good
and
evil
of
pain
and
power
that
goes
by
the
name
of
manhood
and
when
a
new
heir
enters
on
his
inheritance
there
is
a
time
before
he
can
order
it
chapter
x
of
a
political
appointment
a
few
days
later
my
mother
informed
me
that
victoria
and
her
husband
had
proposed
to
pay
us
a
long
visit
i
could
make
no
objection
princess
heinrich
observed
that
i
should
be
glad
to
see
victoria
again
and
should
enjoy
the
companionship
of
william
adolphus
in
my
mind
i
translated
her
speech
into
a
declaration
that
victoria
might
have
some
influence
over
me
although
my
mother
had
none
and
that
william
adolphus
would
be
more
wholesome
company
than
my
countesses
and
wetters
and
such
i
was
unable
to
regard
william
adolphus
as
an
intellectual
resource
and
did
not
associate
victoria
with
the
exercise
of
influence
the
weakness
of
the
princess
new
move
revealed
the
straits
to
which
she
felt
herself
reduced
the
result
of
the
position
which
i
have
described
was
almost
open
strife
between
her
and
me
powerful
bridle
alone
held
her
back
from
declared
rupture
his
method
of
facing
the
danger
was
very
different
he
sought
to
exercise
no
veto
but
he
kept
watch
he
knew
where
i
went
but
made
no
objection
to
my
going
any
liberal
notions
which
i
betrayed
in
conversation
with
him
he
received
with
courteous
attention
and
affected
to
consider
the
result
of
my
own
meditations
had
my
feelings
been
less
deeply
involved
i
think
his
method
would
have
succeeded
even
as
it
was
he
checked
and
retarded
what
he
could
not
stop
the
cordiality
of
our
personal
relations
remained
unbroken
and
so
warm
that
he
felt
himself
able
to
speak
to
me
in
a
way
about
the
countess
von
sempach
a
most
charming
woman
indeed
said
he
in
fact
too
charming
a
woman
i
understood
him
and
began
to
defend
myself
i
not
in
love
with
the
countess
i
said
but
i
give
her
my
confidence
prince
he
shook
his
head
smiled
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
glancing
at
me
humorously
reverse
it
he
suggested
be
in
love
with
her
but
do
give
her
your
confidence
you
find
it
safer
and
also
more
pleasant
that
way
my
confidence
might
affect
high
matters
my
love
he
regarded
as
a
passing
fever
he
did
not
belong
to
an
age
of
strict
morality
in
private
life
and
his
bent
of
mind
was
utterly
opposed
to
considering
an
intrigue
with
a
woman
of
the
countess
attractions
as
a
serious
crime
in
a
young
man
of
my
position
hate
her
was
my
mother
impossible
exhortation
love
her
but
do
trust
her
was
the
prince
subtle
counsel
he
passed
at
once
from
the
subject
content
with
the
seed
that
he
had
sown
there
was
much
in
him
and
in
his
teaching
which
one
would
defend
at
some
cost
of
reputation
but
i
never
left
him
without
a
heightened
and
enhanced
sense
of
my
position
and
my
obligations
if
you
will
he
lowered
the
man
to
exalt
the
king
this
was
of
a
piece
with
all
his
wily
compromises
victoria
arrived
and
her
husband
william
adolphus
attitude
was
less
apologetic
than
it
had
been
before
marriage
he
had
made
victoria
mother
to
a
fine
baby
and
claimed
the
just
credit
he
was
jovial
familiar
and
if
i
may
so
express
myself
brotherly
to
the
last
degree
happily
however
he
interpreted
his
more
assured
position
as
enabling
him
to
choose
his
own
friends
and
his
own
pursuits
these
were
not
mine
and
in
consequence
i
was
little
troubled
with
his
company
as
an
ally
to
my
mother
he
was
a
passive
failure
his
wife
was
worse
than
inactive
victoria
conduct
displayed
the
height
of
unwisdom
she
denounced
the
countess
to
my
face
and
besought
my
mother
to
omit
the
sempachs
from
her
list
of
acquaintances
fortunately
the
princess
had
been
dissuaded
from
forcing
on
an
open
scandal
my
sister
had
to
be
content
with
matching
her
mother
coldness
by
her
rudeness
when
the
countess
came
to
court
need
i
say
that
my
attentions
grew
the
more
marked
and
gossip
even
more
rife
wetter
bill
came
up
for
discussion
and
was
hurled
in
vain
against
hammerfeldt
solid
phalanx
of
country
gentlemen
and
wealthy
i
had
kept
a
seal
on
my
lips
and
in
common
opinion
was
still
the
prince
docile
disciple
wetter
accepted
my
attitude
with
easy
friendliness
but
he
ventured
to
observe
that
if
any
case
arose
which
enabled
me
to
show
that
my
hostility
to
his
party
was
not
inveterate
the
proof
would
be
a
pleasure
to
him
and
his
friends
and
possibly
of
no
disadvantage
to
me
not
the
barest
reference
to
the
countess
pointed
his
remark
i
had
not
seen
her
or
heard
from
her
for
nearly
a
week
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
the
bill
was
thrown
out
i
decided
to
pay
her
a
visit
wetter
was
to
take
luncheon
at
her
house
and
i
allowed
him
to
drop
a
hint
of
my
coming
i
felt
that
i
had
done
my
duty
as
regards
the
bill
i
was
very
apprehensive
of
my
reception
by
the
countess
the
opposition
that
encircled
me
inflamed
my
passion
for
her
the
few
days
separation
had
served
to
convince
me
that
i
could
not
live
without
her
i
found
her
alone
her
face
was
a
little
flushed
and
her
eyes
bright
the
moment
the
door
was
shut
she
turned
on
me
almost
fiercely
why
did
you
send
to
say
you
were
coming
i
did
send
i
told
wetter
besides
i
always
send
before
i
go
anywhere
not
always
before
you
come
to
me
she
retorted
you
not
to
hide
behind
your
throne
c√¶sar
i
was
going
out
if
you
had
prevented
me
the
hindrance
need
not
last
a
moment
said
i
bowing
she
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
then
broke
into
a
reluctant
smile
you
have
sent
to
say
you
were
coming
for
a
week
she
said
no
nor
come
either
yes
of
course
that
it
sit
down
so
will
i
no
in
your
old
place
over
there
max
has
been
giving
me
a
beautiful
bracelet
that
very
kind
of
max
she
glanced
at
me
with
challenging
witchery
and
i
promised
to
wear
it
every
day
never
to
be
without
it
it
look
well
she
held
up
her
arm
where
the
gold
and
jewels
sparkled
on
the
white
skin
as
the
sleeve
of
her
gown
fell
back
i
paid
to
max
bracelet
and
the
arm
which
wore
it
the
meed
of
looks
not
of
words
i
been
afraid
to
come
i
said
is
there
anything
to
be
afraid
of
here
she
asked
with
a
smile
and
a
wave
of
her
hands
because
of
wetter
bill
oh
the
bill
you
were
very
cowardly
c√¶sar
i
could
do
nothing
you
never
can
it
seems
to
me
she
fixed
on
me
eyes
that
she
had
made
quite
grave
and
invested
with
a
critically
discriminating
regard
but
i
very
pleased
to
see
you
oh
and
i
forgot
of
course
i
very
much
honoured
too
i
always
forgetting
what
you
are
on
an
impulse
of
chagrin
at
the
style
of
her
reception
or
of
curiosity
or
of
bitterness
i
spoke
the
thought
of
my
mind
you
never
forget
it
for
a
moment
i
said
i
forget
it
not
you
she
covered
a
start
of
surprise
by
a
hasty
and
pretty
little
yawn
but
her
eyes
were
inquisitive
almost
apprehensive
after
a
moment
she
picked
up
her
old
weapon
the
firescreen
and
hid
her
face
from
the
eyes
downward
but
the
eyes
were
set
on
me
and
now
it
seemed
in
reproach
if
you
think
that
i
wonder
you
come
at
all
she
murmured
i
do
want
you
to
forget
it
but
i
something
besides
yes
a
poor
boy
with
a
cruel
mother
and
a
rude
sister
and
she
sprang
suddenly
to
her
feet
and
she
went
on
a
charming
old
adviser
c√¶sar
i
met
prince
von
hammerfeldt
shall
i
tell
you
what
he
said
to
me
yes
he
bowed
over
my
hand
and
kissed
it
and
smiled
and
twinkled
with
his
old
eyes
and
then
he
said
i
am
growing
vain
of
my
influence
over
his
majesty
the
prince
was
complimenting
you
i
remarked
although
i
was
not
so
dull
as
to
miss
either
hammerfeldt
mockery
or
her
understanding
of
it
complimenting
me
yes
i
suppose
he
was
on
not
having
done
you
any
harm
why
because
i
could
you
would
wish
to
countess
no
but
i
might
wish
to
be
able
to
c√¶sar
she
stood
there
the
embodiment
of
a
power
the
greater
because
it
feigned
distrust
of
its
own
might
no
i
do
mean
that
she
continued
a
moment
later
but
i
should
she
drew
near
to
me
and
catching
up
a
little
chair
sat
down
on
it
close
to
my
elbow
ah
how
i
should
like
the
prince
to
think
i
had
a
little
power
then
in
a
low
coaxing
whisper
she
added
you
need
only
to
pretend
pretend
a
little
just
to
please
me
c√¶sar
and
what
will
you
do
just
to
please
me
countess
my
whisper
was
low
also
but
full
where
hers
had
been
delicate
rough
not
gentle
urging
rather
than
imploring
i
was
no
match
for
her
in
the
science
of
which
she
was
mistress
but
i
did
not
despair
she
seemed
nervous
as
though
she
distrusted
even
her
keen
thrusts
and
ready
parries
i
was
but
a
boy
still
but
sometimes
nature
betrays
the
secrets
of
experience
suddenly
she
broke
out
in
a
new
attack
or
a
new
line
of
the
general
attack
would
you
like
to
show
a
little
independence
she
asked
the
prince
would
like
you
all
the
better
for
it
she
looked
in
my
face
and
people
would
think
more
of
you
they
say
that
hammerfeldt
is
the
real
king
now
or
he
and
princess
heinrich
between
them
i
thought
they
said
that
you
i
do
they
perhaps
they
know
so
little
if
they
knew
anything
they
could
say
that
to
be
told
they
gossiped
of
her
influence
seemed
to
have
no
terror
for
her
her
regret
was
that
the
talk
should
be
all
untrue
and
she
in
fact
impotent
she
stirred
me
to
declare
that
power
was
hers
and
i
her
servant
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
accept
her
leading
was
to
secure
perennial
inspiration
and
a
boundless
reward
was
hammerfeldt
my
schoolmaster
i
was
not
blind
to
the
share
that
vanity
had
in
her
mood
nor
to
ambition
part
in
it
but
i
saw
also
and
exulted
in
her
tenderness
all
these
impulses
in
her
i
was
now
ready
to
use
for
i
also
had
my
vanity
a
boy
vanity
in
a
tribute
wrung
from
a
woman
and
beyond
this
passion
was
strong
in
me
she
went
on
in
real
or
affected
petulance
can
they
point
to
anything
i
have
done
are
any
appointments
made
to
please
me
are
my
friends
ever
favoured
they
are
all
out
in
the
cold
and
likely
to
stay
there
are
they
c√¶sar
oh
you
very
wise
you
take
what
i
give
you
nobody
need
know
of
that
but
you
give
nothing
because
that
would
make
talk
and
gossip
the
prince
has
taught
you
well
yes
you
very
prudent
she
paused
and
stood
looking
at
me
with
a
contemptuous
smile
on
her
lips
then
she
broke
into
a
pitying
little
laugh
poor
boy
said
she
it
a
shame
to
scold
you
you
ca
help
it
it
is
easy
enough
now
to
say
that
all
this
was
cunningly
thought
of
and
cunningly
phrased
yet
it
was
not
all
cunning
or
rather
it
was
the
primitive
unmeditated
cunning
that
nature
gives
to
us
the
instinctive
weapon
to
which
the
woman
flew
in
her
need
a
cunning
of
heart
not
of
brain
however
inspired
however
shaped
it
did
its
work
what
do
you
ask
said
i
in
my
agitation
i
was
brief
and
blunt
ask
must
i
ask
well
i
ask
that
you
should
show
somehow
how
you
will
that
you
trust
us
that
we
are
not
outcasts
as
princess
heinrich
calls
us
lepers
do
it
how
you
like
choose
anybody
you
like
from
among
us
i
do
ask
for
any
special
person
show
that
some
one
of
us
has
your
confidence
why
should
you
the
king
should
be
above
prejudice
and
we
honest
some
of
us
i
tried
to
speak
lightly
and
smiled
at
her
you
are
all
i
love
in
the
world
some
of
you
i
said
she
sat
down
again
in
the
little
chair
and
turned
her
face
upward
toward
me
then
do
it
c√¶sar
she
said
very
softly
it
had
been
announced
a
few
days
before
that
our
ambassador
at
paris
had
asked
to
be
relieved
of
his
post
there
was
already
talk
about
his
successor
remembering
this
i
said
more
in
jest
than
seriousness
the
paris
embassy
would
that
satisfy
you
her
face
became
suddenly
radiant
merry
and
triumphant
she
clapped
her
hands
and
then
held
them
clasped
toward
me
you
suggested
it
yourself
she
cried
in
joke
joke
i
wo
be
joked
with
i
choose
that
you
should
be
serious
you
said
the
paris
embassy
are
you
afraid
it
make
hammerfeldt
too
angry
fancy
the
princess
and
your
sister
how
i
shall
love
to
see
them
she
dropped
her
voice
as
she
added
do
it
for
me
c√¶sar
who
should
have
it
i
do
care
anybody
so
long
as
he
one
of
us
choose
somebody
good
and
then
you
can
defy
them
all
she
saw
the
seriousness
that
had
now
fallen
on
me
what
i
had
idly
suggested
and
she
caught
up
with
so
fervent
a
welcome
was
no
small
thing
if
i
did
it
it
would
be
at
the
cost
of
hammerfeldt
confidence
perhaps
of
his
services
he
might
refuse
to
endure
such
an
open
rebuff
and
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
the
specious
justifications
were
unsound
i
should
not
act
because
of
them
they
were
the
merest
pretext
i
should
give
what
she
asked
to
her
should
i
not
be
giving
her
my
honour
also
that
public
honour
which
i
had
learned
to
hold
so
high
i
ca
promise
you
must
let
me
think
i
pleaded
i
was
prepared
for
another
outburst
of
petulance
for
accusations
of
timidity
of
indifference
again
of
willingness
to
take
and
unwillingness
to
give
but
she
sat
still
looking
at
me
intently
and
presently
laid
her
hand
in
mine
yes
think
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
bent
down
and
kissed
the
hand
that
lay
in
mine
then
she
raised
it
and
held
her
arm
up
before
him
max
bracelet
she
said
sighing
again
and
smiling
then
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
walking
to
the
hearth
stood
looking
down
into
the
fire
i
did
not
join
her
but
sat
in
my
chair
for
a
long
while
neither
of
us
spoke
at
last
i
rose
slowly
she
heard
the
movement
and
turned
her
head
i
will
come
again
i
said
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
regarding
me
intently
then
she
walked
quickly
across
to
me
holding
out
her
hands
as
i
took
them
she
laughed
nervously
i
did
not
speak
but
i
looked
into
her
eyes
and
then
as
i
pressed
her
hands
i
kissed
her
cheek
the
nervous
laugh
came
again
but
she
said
nothing
i
left
her
standing
there
and
went
out
i
walked
home
alone
through
the
lighted
streets
it
has
always
been
and
is
still
my
custom
to
walk
about
freely
and
unattended
this
evening
the
friendly
greetings
of
those
who
chanced
to
recognise
me
in
the
glare
of
the
lamps
were
pleasant
to
me
i
remember
thinking
that
all
these
good
folk
would
be
grieved
if
they
knew
what
was
going
on
in
the
young
king
mind
how
he
was
torn
hither
and
thither
his
only
joy
a
crime
and
the
guarding
of
his
honour
become
a
sacrifice
that
seemed
too
great
for
his
strength
there
was
one
fellow
in
particular
whom
i
noticed
drinking
a
glass
at
a
he
took
off
his
hat
to
me
with
a
cheery
god
bless
your
majesty
i
should
have
liked
to
sit
down
by
him
and
tell
him
all
about
it
he
had
been
young
and
he
looked
shrewd
and
friendly
i
had
nobody
whom
i
could
tell
about
it
i
do
remember
ever
seeing
this
man
again
but
i
think
of
him
still
as
one
who
might
have
been
a
friend
by
his
dress
he
appeared
to
be
a
clerk
or
shopkeeper
i
had
an
appointment
for
that
evening
with
hammerfeldt
but
found
a
note
in
which
he
excused
himself
from
coming
he
had
taken
a
chill
and
was
confined
to
his
bed
the
business
could
wait
he
said
but
went
on
to
remark
that
no
time
should
be
lost
in
considering
the
question
of
the
paris
embassy
he
added
three
or
four
names
as
possible
selections
all
those
mentioned
were
and
decided
adherents
of
his
own
i
was
reading
his
letter
when
my
mother
and
victoria
came
in
they
had
heard
of
the
prince
indisposition
but
on
making
inquiries
were
informed
that
it
was
not
serious
i
sent
at
once
to
inquire
after
him
and
handed
his
note
to
the
princess
any
of
those
would
do
very
well
she
said
when
she
finished
it
they
have
all
been
trained
under
the
prince
and
are
thoroughly
acquainted
with
his
views
and
with
mine
i
asked
smiling
a
look
of
surprise
appeared
on
my
mother
face
she
looked
at
me
doubtfully
the
prince
views
are
yours
i
suppose
she
said
i
not
sure
i
like
any
of
his
selections
i
observed
i
do
not
think
that
my
mother
would
have
said
anything
more
at
the
time
her
judgment
having
been
convinced
she
would
not
allow
temper
to
lead
her
into
hostilities
here
as
so
often
the
unwise
course
was
left
to
my
dear
victoria
who
embraced
it
with
her
usual
readiness
does
wetter
like
any
of
them
she
asked
ironically
i
remained
silent
she
came
nearer
and
looked
into
my
face
laughing
maliciously
or
is
it
the
countess
have
they
made
enough
love
to
the
countess
or
too
much
or
what
my
dear
victoria
i
said
you
must
make
allowances
the
countess
is
the
prettiest
woman
in
forstadt
my
sister
curtseyed
with
an
ironical
smile
i
mean
of
course
i
added
since
william
adolphus
carried
you
off
to
gronenstahl
my
mother
interrupted
this
little
quarrel
i
sure
you
be
guided
by
the
prince
judgment
she
observed
victoria
was
not
to
be
quenched
and
not
by
the
beauty
of
the
prettiest
woman
in
forstadt
and
she
added
the
creature
as
plebeian
as
she
can
be
as
a
rule
i
was
ready
enough
to
spar
with
my
sister
i
had
not
the
spirit
moreover
she
whom
as
a
rule
i
could
treat
with
indifference
had
power
to
wound
the
least
weighty
of
people
speaking
the
truth
can
not
be
wholly
disregarded
i
prepared
to
go
to
my
room
remarking
of
course
i
shall
discuss
the
matter
with
the
prince
again
victoria
rushed
to
the
fray
you
mean
that
it
not
our
business
she
asked
with
a
toss
of
her
head
i
was
goaded
beyond
endurance
and
it
was
not
their
business
princess
heinrich
might
find
some
excuse
in
her
familiarity
with
public
affairs
victoria
at
least
could
urge
no
such
plea
i
am
always
glad
of
my
mother
advice
victoria
said
i
and
with
a
bow
i
left
them
as
i
went
out
i
heard
victoria
cry
it
all
that
hateful
woman
naturally
the
thing
appeared
to
me
then
in
a
different
light
from
that
in
which
i
can
see
it
now
i
can
not
now
think
that
my
mother
and
sister
were
wrong
to
be
anxious
disturbed
alarmed
even
angry
with
the
lady
who
occasioned
them
such
discomfort
a
young
man
under
the
influence
of
an
older
woman
is
no
doubt
a
legitimate
occasion
for
the
fears
and
efforts
of
his
female
relatives
i
have
recorded
what
they
said
not
in
protest
against
their
feelings
but
to
show
the
singularly
unfortunate
manner
in
which
they
made
what
they
felt
manifest
my
object
is
not
to
blame
what
was
probably
inevitable
in
them
but
to
show
how
they
overreached
themselves
and
became
not
a
drag
on
my
infatuation
as
they
hoped
but
rather
a
spur
that
incited
my
passion
to
a
quicker
course
that
spur
i
did
not
need
she
seemed
to
stand
before
me
still
as
i
had
left
her
with
my
kiss
fresh
on
her
cheeks
and
on
her
lips
that
strange
nervous
helpless
laugh
the
laugh
that
admitted
a
folly
she
could
not
conquer
expressed
a
shame
that
burned
her
even
while
she
braved
it
and
owned
a
love
so
compact
of
this
folly
and
this
shame
that
its
joy
seemed
all
one
with
their
bitterness
but
to
my
younger
heart
and
hotter
man
blood
the
folly
and
shame
were
now
beaten
down
by
the
joy
it
freed
itself
from
them
and
soared
up
into
my
heart
on
a
liberated
and
triumphant
wing
i
had
achieved
this
thing
i
the
boy
they
laughed
at
and
tried
to
rule
she
herself
had
laughed
at
me
she
laughed
thus
no
more
when
i
kissed
her
she
had
not
called
me
c√¶sar
she
had
found
no
utterance
save
in
that
laugh
and
the
message
of
that
laugh
was
surrender
chapter
xi
an
act
of
abdication
the
night
brought
me
little
rest
and
no
wisdom
as
though
its
own
strength
were
not
enough
my
passion
sought
and
found
an
ally
in
a
defiant
obstinacy
which
now
made
me
desirous
of
doing
what
the
countess
asked
for
its
own
sake
as
well
as
for
hers
being
diffident
i
sought
a
mask
in
violence
i
wanted
to
assert
myself
to
show
the
women
that
i
was
not
to
be
driven
and
hammerfeldt
that
i
was
not
to
be
led
neither
their
brusque
insistence
nor
his
suave
and
dexterous
suggestions
should
control
me
or
prevent
me
from
exercising
my
own
will
a
distorted
view
of
my
position
caused
me
to
find
its
essence
in
the
power
of
doing
as
i
liked
and
its
dignity
in
disregarding
wholesome
advice
because
i
objected
to
the
manner
in
which
it
was
tendered
this
mood
ready
and
natural
enough
in
youth
was
an
instrument
of
which
my
passion
made
effective
use
i
pictured
the
consternation
of
my
advisers
with
hardly
less
pleasure
than
the
delight
of
her
whom
i
sought
to
serve
my
sense
of
responsibility
was
dulled
and
deadened
i
had
rather
do
wrong
than
do
nothing
cause
harm
than
be
the
cause
of
nothing
that
men
should
blame
me
rather
than
not
canvass
my
actions
or
fail
to
attribute
to
me
any
initiative
i
felt
somehow
that
the
blame
would
lie
with
my
counsellors
they
had
undertaken
to
guide
and
control
me
if
they
failed
they
more
than
i
must
answer
for
the
failure
sophistry
of
this
kind
passes
well
enough
with
one
who
wants
excuses
and
may
even
array
itself
in
a
cloak
of
plausibility
it
was
strong
in
my
mind
by
virtue
of
the
strong
resentment
from
which
it
sprang
and
the
strong
ally
to
which
its
forces
were
joined
passion
and
were
at
one
my
conquest
would
be
while
the
countess
was
brought
to
acknowledge
my
sway
those
who
had
hitherto
ruled
my
life
would
be
reduced
to
a
renunciation
of
their
authority
the
day
seemed
to
me
to
promise
at
once
emancipation
and
conquest
to
mark
the
point
at
which
i
was
to
gain
both
liberty
and
empire
when
i
should
become
indeed
a
king
both
in
my
own
palace
and
in
her
heart
a
king
in
the
morning
i
was
occupied
in
routine
business
with
one
of
the
ministers
this
gentleman
gave
me
a
tolerably
good
account
of
hammerfeldt
although
it
appeared
that
the
prince
was
suffering
from
a
difficulty
in
breathing
there
seemed
however
no
cause
for
alarm
and
when
i
had
sent
to
make
inquiries
i
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
remain
at
home
and
await
the
return
of
my
messenger
i
paid
my
usual
formal
visit
to
my
mother
apartments
the
princess
did
not
refer
to
our
previous
conversation
but
her
manner
toward
me
was
even
unusually
stiff
and
distant
i
think
that
she
had
expected
repentance
when
i
in
my
turn
ignored
the
matter
she
became
curt
and
disagreeable
i
left
her
more
than
ever
determined
on
my
course
i
was
glad
to
escape
an
interview
with
victoria
and
was
now
free
to
keep
my
appointment
with
wetter
i
had
proposed
to
lunch
with
him
saying
that
i
had
one
or
two
matters
to
discuss
even
in
my
obstinacy
and
excitement
i
remained
shrewd
enough
to
see
the
advantage
of
being
furnished
with
reasons
for
the
step
that
i
was
about
to
take
wetter
forensic
sharpness
ready
wit
and
persuasive
eloquence
would
dress
my
case
in
better
colours
than
i
could
contrive
for
myself
it
mattered
little
to
me
how
well
he
knew
that
arguments
were
needed
not
to
convince
myself
but
to
flourish
in
the
faces
of
those
who
opposed
and
criticised
me
it
was
also
my
intention
to
obtain
from
him
the
name
of
two
or
three
of
his
friends
who
apart
from
their
views
were
decently
qualified
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
the
post
in
the
event
of
their
nomination
it
was
no
shock
but
rather
a
piquant
titillation
of
my
bitter
humour
when
i
disentangled
from
wetter
confident
and
eloquent
description
of
the
ideal
ambassador
a
tolerably
accurate
if
somewhat
partial
portrait
of
himself
i
was
rather
surprised
at
his
desire
for
the
position
subsequently
i
learned
that
pecuniary
embarrassments
made
him
willing
to
abandon
for
a
time
at
least
the
greater
but
more
uncertain
chances
of
active
political
warfare
however
given
that
he
desired
the
embassy
it
caused
me
no
surprise
that
he
should
ask
for
it
to
appoint
him
would
be
open
war
indeed
he
was
the
prince
my
mother
pet
aversion
that
he
was
totally
untrained
in
diplomacy
was
a
minor
but
possibly
serious
objection
that
he
was
extreme
in
his
views
seemed
to
me
then
no
disqualification
i
allowed
him
to
perceive
that
i
read
his
parable
but
remembering
the
case
of
the
greek
generals
and
themistocles
ventured
to
ask
him
to
give
me
another
name
the
only
name
that
i
could
give
your
majesty
with
perfect
confidence
would
be
that
of
my
good
friend
max
von
sempach
said
he
with
an
admirable
air
of
honesty
but
as
i
thought
a
covert
gleam
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
i
very
nearly
laughed
the
only
man
fit
for
the
embassy
except
himself
was
count
max
and
if
count
max
went
of
course
the
countess
would
go
with
him
equally
of
course
the
king
must
stay
in
forstadt
i
saw
wetter
looking
at
me
keenly
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
it
did
not
suit
me
that
he
should
read
my
thoughts
this
time
i
appeared
to
have
no
suspicion
of
the
good
faith
of
his
suggestion
and
said
with
an
air
of
surprise
max
von
sempach
why
how
is
he
suitable
with
great
gravity
he
gave
me
many
reasons
proving
not
that
max
was
very
suitable
but
that
everybody
else
was
profoundly
unsuitable
except
the
unmentioned
candidate
whose
name
was
so
well
understood
between
us
these
i
observed
would
seem
to
be
reasons
for
looking
elsewhere
i
mean
to
the
other
side
for
a
suitable
man
he
did
not
trouble
to
argue
that
with
me
he
knew
that
his
was
not
the
voice
to
which
i
should
listen
if
your
majesty
comes
to
that
conclusion
my
friends
and
i
will
be
disappointed
he
said
but
we
must
accept
your
decision
there
was
much
to
like
in
wetter
men
are
not
insincere
merely
because
they
are
ambitious
dishonest
merely
because
they
are
given
to
intrigue
selfish
merely
because
they
ask
places
for
themselves
there
is
a
grossness
of
moral
fibre
not
in
itself
a
good
thing
but
very
different
from
rottenness
wetter
was
a
keen
and
convinced
partisan
and
an
ardent
believer
in
himself
his
cause
ought
to
win
and
if
his
hand
could
take
the
helm
would
win
this
was
his
attitude
and
it
excused
some
want
of
scruple
both
in
promoting
the
cause
and
in
insuring
to
it
his
own
effective
support
but
he
was
a
big
man
of
a
nature
hearty
sympathetic
and
free
from
cant
full
of
force
of
wit
of
unblunted
emotion
he
would
not
however
have
made
at
all
a
good
ambassador
and
he
would
not
have
wanted
to
be
one
had
he
not
run
into
debt
max
von
sempach
on
the
other
hand
would
fill
the
place
respectably
although
not
brilliantly
wetter
knew
this
and
the
fact
gave
to
the
mention
of
the
count
name
a
decent
appearance
without
depriving
it
of
its
harmlessness
he
named
a
suitable
but
an
impossible
person
a
person
to
me
impossible
soon
after
the
meal
i
left
him
telling
him
that
i
should
come
in
again
later
and
had
ordered
my
carriage
to
call
for
me
at
his
house
at
five
turning
down
the
quiet
lane
that
led
to
the
countess
i
soon
reached
my
destination
i
was
now
in
less
agitation
than
on
the
day
before
my
mind
was
made
up
i
came
to
give
what
she
asked
wetter
should
have
his
embassy
more
than
this
i
came
no
longer
in
trepidation
no
longer
fearing
her
ridicule
even
while
i
sought
her
love
no
more
oppressed
with
the
sense
that
in
truth
she
might
be
laughing
while
she
seemed
to
encourage
there
was
the
dawning
of
triumph
in
my
heart
an
assurance
of
victory
and
the
fierce
delight
in
a
determination
come
to
at
great
cost
and
to
be
held
it
may
be
at
greater
still
in
all
these
feelings
mighty
always
there
were
for
me
the
freshness
the
rush
of
youth
and
the
venturous
joy
of
new
experience
on
her
also
a
crisis
of
feeling
had
come
she
was
not
her
old
self
nor
i
to
her
what
i
had
been
there
was
a
strained
almost
frightened
look
in
her
eyes
a
augustin
replacing
her
bantering
c√¶sar
save
for
my
name
she
did
not
speak
as
i
led
her
to
a
couch
and
sat
down
by
her
side
she
looked
slight
girlish
and
pathetic
in
a
simple
gown
of
black
timidity
renewed
her
youth
well
might
i
forget
that
she
was
not
a
maiden
of
meet
age
for
me
and
she
herself
for
an
instant
cheat
time
reckoning
she
made
of
me
a
man
of
herself
a
girl
and
prayed
love
advocacy
to
prove
the
delusion
true
i
have
been
with
wetter
said
i
he
wants
the
embassy
i
fancy
that
she
knew
his
desire
her
hand
pressed
mine
but
she
did
not
speak
but
he
recommended
max
i
went
on
max
for
a
moment
her
face
was
full
of
terror
as
she
turned
to
me
then
she
broke
into
a
smile
wetter
advice
was
plain
to
her
also
you
see
how
much
he
wants
it
for
himself
said
i
he
knows
i
would
sooner
send
a
than
max
and
you
know
it
do
i
she
murmured
i
rose
and
stood
before
her
it
is
yours
to
give
not
mine
said
i
do
you
give
it
to
wetter
as
she
looked
up
at
me
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
while
her
lips
curved
in
a
timid
smile
what
what
trouble
you
get
into
she
said
it
not
a
thousandth
part
of
what
i
would
do
for
you
wetter
shall
have
it
then
or
max
not
max
she
said
her
eyes
told
me
why
it
should
not
be
max
then
wetter
and
i
fell
on
one
knee
by
her
whispering
the
king
gives
it
to
his
queen
they
blame
you
so
they
say
all
sorts
of
things
i
sha
hear
them
i
hear
only
you
they
be
unkind
to
you
they
ca
hurt
me
if
you
kind
to
me
perhaps
they
say
i
i
got
it
from
you
i
am
not
ashamed
what
is
it
to
me
what
they
say
you
do
care
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
you
and
to
be
with
you
she
sat
looking
up
at
me
for
an
instant
then
she
threw
her
arm
over
the
end
of
the
sofa
and
laid
her
face
on
the
cushion
i
heard
her
sob
softly
her
other
hand
lay
in
her
lap
i
took
it
and
raised
it
to
my
lips
i
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
her
tears
i
was
triumphant
she
sobbed
not
loudly
or
violently
but
with
a
pitiful
gentleness
why
do
you
cry
so
darling
i
whispered
she
turned
her
face
to
me
the
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
why
do
i
cry
she
moaned
softly
because
i
wicked
i
suppose
wicked
and
so
foolish
and
and
you
are
good
and
noble
and
and
you
be
great
and
the
sobs
choked
her
voice
and
she
turned
her
face
half
away
and
i
old
augustin
i
could
not
enter
into
her
mood
joy
pervaded
me
but
neither
did
i
scorn
her
nor
grow
impatient
i
perceived
dimly
that
she
struggled
with
a
conflict
of
emotions
beyond
my
understanding
words
were
unsafe
likely
to
be
wrong
to
make
worse
what
they
sought
to
cure
i
caressed
her
but
trusted
my
tongue
no
further
than
to
murmur
endearments
she
grew
calmer
sat
up
and
dried
her
eyes
but
it
so
absurd
she
protested
augustin
lots
of
boys
are
just
as
absurd
as
you
but
was
any
woman
ever
as
absurd
as
i
am
why
do
you
call
it
absurd
oh
because
because
she
moved
near
me
suddenly
because
although
i
tried
so
hard
i
ca
feel
it
the
least
absurd
i
do
love
you
here
was
her
prepossession
all
the
while
that
the
thing
would
seem
absurd
not
that
there
was
sin
in
it
i
can
see
now
why
her
mind
fixed
on
this
point
she
was
in
truth
speaking
not
to
me
who
was
there
by
her
me
as
i
was
but
to
the
man
who
should
be
she
pleaded
not
only
with
herself
but
with
my
future
self
praying
the
mature
man
to
think
of
her
with
tenderness
and
not
with
a
laugh
interceding
with
what
should
one
day
be
my
memory
of
her
ah
my
dear
that
prayer
of
yours
is
answered
i
do
not
laugh
as
i
write
at
you
i
could
never
have
laughed
and
if
i
set
out
to
force
a
laugh
even
at
myself
i
fall
to
thinking
of
what
you
were
and
again
i
do
not
laugh
then
what
is
it
that
the
world
outside
must
have
laughed
with
a
very
wisdom
its
laughter
was
nothing
to
us
then
and
is
to
me
as
nothing
is
it
not
always
ready
to
weep
at
a
farce
and
laugh
at
a
tragedy
but
you
nobody
else
she
went
on
softly
i
should
have
dared
if
you
had
anybody
else
long
ago
do
you
remember
you
had
nobody
and
you
liked
me
to
kiss
you
i
believe
i
began
to
love
you
then
i
mean
i
began
to
think
how
much
some
woman
would
love
you
some
day
but
i
did
think
i
should
be
the
woman
oh
do
look
at
me
so
hard
or
or
you
see
how
much
you
love
me
no
no
you
see
my
wrinkles
see
if
i
do
this
you
ca
look
at
my
face
and
putting
her
arms
round
my
neck
she
hid
her
face
i
was
strangely
or
perhaps
not
strangely
for
there
comes
a
time
when
the
eyes
say
all
that
there
is
desire
or
need
to
say
her
pleadings
were
in
answer
to
my
eyes
oh
i
know
you
think
so
now
she
murmured
but
you
wo
go
on
thinking
so
and
i
shall
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
now
a
smile
of
triumph
came
on
her
face
oh
but
you
do
think
so
now
she
whispered
in
a
voice
still
lower
but
full
of
delight
you
do
think
so
now
and
again
she
hid
her
face
from
me
but
i
knew
that
the
triumph
had
entered
into
her
soul
also
and
that
the
shadows
could
no
longer
altogether
dim
its
sunshine
for
her
the
afternoon
became
full
and
waned
to
dusk
as
we
sat
together
we
said
little
there
were
no
arrangements
made
we
seemed
in
a
way
cut
off
from
the
world
outside
and
from
the
consideration
of
it
the
life
which
we
must
each
lead
lives
in
the
main
apart
from
one
another
had
receded
into
distance
and
went
unnoticed
we
had
nothing
to
do
save
to
be
together
when
we
were
together
there
was
little
that
we
cared
to
say
no
protestations
that
we
had
need
to
make
there
was
between
us
so
absolute
a
sympathy
so
full
an
agreement
in
all
that
we
gave
all
that
we
accepted
all
that
we
abandoned
doubts
and
struggles
were
as
though
they
had
never
been
there
is
a
temptation
to
think
sometimes
that
things
so
perfectly
justify
themselves
that
conscience
is
not
discrowned
by
violence
but
signs
a
willing
abdication
herself
convinced
for
passion
can
simulate
right
even
as
in
some
natures
the
love
of
right
becomes
a
turbulent
passion
in
the
end
like
most
of
such
destructive
of
itself
then
i
am
yours
and
you
are
mine
and
the
embassy
is
wetter
the
embassy
is
whose
you
like
she
cried
if
the
rest
is
true
it
is
wetter
do
you
know
why
that
everybody
may
know
how
i
am
yours
she
did
not
refuse
even
the
perilous
fame
i
offered
i
should
be
proud
of
it
she
said
with
head
erect
no
no
nobody
shall
breathe
a
letter
of
your
name
i
exclaimed
in
a
sudden
turn
of
feeling
i
will
swear
that
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
you
hate
him
that
you
never
mentioned
it
say
what
you
like
she
whispered
if
i
did
that
i
should
say
to
all
forstadt
that
there
no
woman
in
the
world
like
you
you
need
say
it
to
all
forstadt
you
have
even
said
it
to
me
yet
we
had
been
sitting
together
again
i
fell
on
one
knee
prepared
to
offer
her
formal
homage
in
a
sweet
extravagance
on
a
sudden
she
raised
her
hand
her
face
grew
alarmed
hark
she
said
hark
to
your
voice
yours
only
no
there
is
a
noise
somebody
is
coming
who
can
it
be
i
do
care
who
it
is
why
dearest
but
you
must
care
get
up
get
up
get
up
i
rose
slowly
to
my
feet
i
was
indeed
in
a
mood
when
i
did
not
care
the
steps
were
close
outside
before
they
could
come
nearer
i
kissed
her
again
who
can
it
be
i
am
denied
to
everybody
she
said
bewildered
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
it
is
not
max
she
said
with
a
swift
glance
at
me
i
stood
where
i
was
come
in
she
cried
the
door
opened
and
to
my
amazement
wetter
stood
there
he
was
panting
as
though
he
had
run
fast
and
his
air
displayed
agitation
the
countess
ran
to
him
instantly
his
coming
seemed
to
revive
the
fears
which
her
love
had
laid
to
rest
what
is
it
she
cried
what
the
matter
wetter
took
absolutely
no
notice
of
her
walking
on
as
though
she
were
not
there
he
came
straight
up
to
me
he
spoke
in
tones
of
intense
emotion
and
with
the
bluntness
that
excitement
brings
you
must
come
with
me
at
once
he
said
in
an
imperious
way
sent
for
you
to
my
house
we
can
get
in
together
by
the
back
door
but
what
the
matter
man
i
cried
divided
between
puzzle
and
anger
you
wanted
you
must
go
to
hammerfeldt
to
hammerfeldt
yes
he
dying
come
along
dying
my
god
the
message
is
urgent
there
no
time
to
lose
if
you
want
to
see
him
alive
come
i
said
you
were
lying
down
in
my
study
if
you
do
come
quickly
it
will
be
known
where
you
are
i
do
care
for
that
he
sent
for
you
himself
the
countess
had
moved
to
my
side
you
must
go
she
said
now
laying
her
hand
on
my
arm
i
turned
to
look
at
her
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
vague
alarm
i
was
like
a
man
suddenly
roused
through
a
vivid
entrancing
dream
unable
still
to
believe
that
the
real
is
true
and
the
phantasm
not
the
only
substance
come
come
repeated
wetter
urgently
and
irritably
you
ca
let
him
die
without
going
to
him
go
augustin
she
whispered
yes
i
go
i
going
i
going
at
once
i
stammered
i
ready
wetter
take
me
with
you
is
he
really
dying
so
they
say
hammerfeldt
dying
yes
i
come
with
you
i
turned
to
the
countess
wetter
was
already
to
the
door
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
his
face
was
impatient
my
eyes
met
hers
i
read
the
fear
that
was
in
hers
i
was
strangely
fearful
myself
appalled
at
such
a
breaking
of
our
dream
i
said
i
come
again
soon
some
time
yes
yes
said
she
but
hardly
as
though
she
believed
me
i
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
wetter
looked
on
saying
nothing
the
thought
of
concealment
did
not
occur
to
me
i
kissed
her
hand
two
or
three
times
shall
you
find
him
alive
she
murmured
in
speculation
more
than
in
question
i
do
know
she
herself
led
me
to
where
wetter
was
standing
it
his
breathing
said
wetter
he
ca
get
his
breath
ca
speak
at
all
come
along
i
ready
i
follow
you
as
i
reached
the
door
i
turned
she
was
not
looking
at
me
she
had
sat
down
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
was
gazing
fixedly
at
the
flames
i
have
had
that
picture
of
her
often
in
my
mind
wetter
led
me
downstairs
and
out
into
the
street
at
a
rapid
pace
i
followed
him
trying
to
gather
myself
together
and
think
coherently
too
sudden
a
change
paralyzes
the
mind
must
have
time
for
readjustment
hammerfeldt
was
and
had
always
been
so
large
a
figure
and
a
presence
so
important
in
my
life
i
could
only
whisper
to
myself
he
dying
his
breathing
he
ca
get
his
breath
we
went
in
by
the
back
door
as
we
had
arranged
and
gained
the
study
quick
whispered
wetter
remember
you
were
in
here
do
make
any
excuses
about
delay
or
put
it
on
me
say
i
hesitated
to
rouse
you
i
listened
little
to
all
that
he
said
and
paid
small
heed
to
the
precautions
that
his
wariness
suggested
i
hope
he
wo
be
dead
when
you
get
there
he
added
as
we
started
for
the
hall
here
your
hat
i
caught
at
the
word
dead
if
he
dead
i
repeated
aimlessly
if
he
dead
wetter
then
for
an
instant
he
turned
to
me
his
face
full
of
expression
his
eyes
keen
and
eager
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
an
old
man
said
he
we
must
all
die
and
if
he
dead
well
wetter
well
well
then
you
king
at
last
with
this
he
opened
the
door
of
my
carriage
and
stood
holding
it
i
looked
him
full
in
the
face
before
i
stepped
in
he
did
not
flinch
he
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
you
king
at
last
he
seemed
to
say
again
chapter
xii
king
at
a
price
the
death
of
prince
von
hammerfeldt
furnished
the
subject
of
a
picture
exhibited
at
forstadt
with
great
success
a
few
years
ago
the
old
simple
room
its
plain
furniture
the
large
window
facing
the
garden
were
faithfully
given
the
bed
was
his
bed
and
no
other
bed
the
nurses
were
portraits
the
doctors
were
portraits
the
prince
features
were
exactly
mapped
i
myself
was
represented
sitting
in
an
armchair
by
his
side
with
a
strong
light
on
my
face
as
i
leaned
forward
to
catch
his
faint
words
the
artist
performance
was
in
fact
a
singularly
competent
reproduction
of
every
external
object
human
or
other
in
the
room
and
with
the
necessary
alteration
of
features
and
title
the
picture
would
have
served
to
commemorate
the
of
any
aged
statesman
who
had
a
young
prince
for
his
pupil
hammerfeldt
is
evidently
giving
a
brief
summary
of
his
principles
providing
me
with
a
of
kingship
a
manual
on
the
management
of
men
i
listen
with
an
expression
of
deep
attention
and
respectful
grief
by
a
touch
which
no
doubt
is
dramatic
the
other
figures
are
gazing
intently
at
me
on
whom
the
future
depends
not
at
the
dying
man
whose
course
is
run
looking
at
the
work
as
a
whole
i
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
that
i
was
recommended
to
bestow
the
cross
of
paul
on
the
painter
i
consented
without
demur
in
mere
matters
of
taste
i
have
always
considered
myself
bound
to
reflect
public
opinion
now
for
reality
an
old
man
struggling
hard
for
breath
gasps
now
quicker
now
slower
a
few
words
choked
unintelligible
eyes
that
were
full
of
an
impotent
desire
to
speak
these
came
first
then
the
doctors
gathered
round
looked
whispered
went
away
i
rose
and
walked
twice
across
the
room
coming
back
i
stood
and
looked
at
him
still
he
knew
me
suddenly
his
hand
moved
toward
me
i
bent
my
head
till
my
ear
was
within
three
inches
of
his
lips
i
could
hear
nothing
i
saw
a
doctor
standing
by
watch
in
hand
he
was
timing
the
breath
that
grew
slower
and
slower
will
he
speak
i
asked
in
a
whisper
a
shake
of
the
head
answered
me
i
looked
again
into
his
eyes
now
he
seemed
to
speak
to
me
my
face
grew
hot
and
red
but
i
did
not
speak
to
him
yet
i
stroked
his
hand
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
understanding
in
his
eyes
a
moment
later
his
eyes
closed
the
gasps
became
slower
and
slower
i
raised
my
head
and
looked
across
at
the
doctor
his
watch
had
a
gold
front
protecting
the
glass
he
shut
the
front
on
the
face
with
a
click
very
likely
there
were
no
proper
materials
for
a
picture
here
the
sentiment
the
historical
interest
the
situation
would
all
have
been
defective
men
die
in
so
very
much
the
same
way
and
in
so
very
much
the
same
way
men
watch
them
dying
death
is
the
triumph
of
the
physical
i
must
not
complain
that
the
painter
imported
some
sentiment
in
twenty
minutes
i
was
back
again
in
my
carriage
being
driven
home
rapidly
my
dinner
was
ready
and
baptiste
in
attendance
ah
he
is
dead
said
baptiste
as
he
fashioned
my
napkin
into
a
more
perfect
shape
yes
baptiste
he
dead
said
i
bring
me
some
slippers
your
majesty
will
not
dress
a
smoking
jacket
said
i
while
i
ate
my
dinner
baptiste
chattered
about
the
prince
there
was
a
kindly
humanity
in
the
man
that
gave
a
whimsical
tenderness
to
what
he
said
ah
now
le
prince
knew
the
world
well
and
where
is
he
gone
well
at
least
he
will
not
be
disappointed
to
die
at
eighty
it
is
only
to
go
to
bed
when
one
is
tired
what
use
would
there
be
in
sitting
up
with
heavy
eyes
that
is
to
bore
yourself
and
the
company
has
the
princess
expressed
a
wish
to
see
me
i
asked
certainly
sire
at
your
leisure
i
said
his
majesty
must
dine
the
princess
is
much
upset
it
seems
she
was
greatly
attached
to
the
prince
he
looked
at
me
shrewdly
she
valued
the
prince
very
highly
he
added
as
though
in
correction
of
his
previous
statement
i
go
directly
i
done
dinner
send
and
say
so
i
was
not
surprised
that
consternation
reigned
in
the
heart
of
my
mother
and
extended
its
sway
to
victoria
victoria
was
crying
princess
heinrich
eyes
were
dry
but
her
lips
set
in
a
despairing
closeness
both
invited
me
to
kiss
them
what
will
you
do
without
him
asked
victoria
dabbing
her
eyes
you
have
lost
your
best
your
only
guide
said
my
mother
i
told
them
what
i
had
to
tell
about
hammerfeldt
death
victoria
broke
into
compassionate
comments
my
mother
listened
in
silence
poor
old
hammerfeldt
i
ended
reflectively
where
were
you
when
you
got
the
news
asked
victoria
i
looked
at
her
then
i
answered
quietly
i
was
calling
on
the
countess
von
sempach
i
lunched
with
wetter
and
went
on
there
there
was
a
pause
i
believe
that
my
candour
was
a
surprise
perhaps
it
seemed
a
defiance
did
you
tell
the
prince
that
my
mother
asked
the
prince
i
answered
was
not
in
a
state
to
listen
to
anything
that
i
might
have
said
not
even
to
anything
of
importance
fancy
if
he
known
on
his
was
victoria
very
audible
whisper
my
mother
looked
at
me
with
a
despairing
expression
i
am
unwilling
to
do
either
her
or
my
sister
an
injustice
but
i
wondered
then
how
much
thought
they
were
giving
to
the
old
friend
we
had
lost
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
thought
little
of
the
man
we
knew
the
man
himself
not
grief
but
fear
was
dominant
in
them
wetter
saying
you
king
at
last
came
into
my
mind
perhaps
their
mood
was
intelligible
enough
and
did
not
want
excuse
they
had
seen
in
hammerfeldt
my
schoolmaster
his
hand
was
gone
and
could
no
longer
guide
or
restrain
me
to
one
a
son
to
the
other
a
younger
brother
by
both
i
was
counted
incapable
of
standing
alone
or
choosing
my
own
path
hammerfeldt
was
gone
wetter
remained
the
countess
von
sempach
remained
there
was
the
new
position
the
prince
death
then
might
well
be
to
them
so
great
a
calamity
as
to
lose
its
rank
among
sorrows
regrets
for
the
past
be
ousted
by
terror
for
the
future
and
the
loss
of
an
ally
obliterate
grief
for
a
friend
but
you
know
his
wishes
and
his
views
said
my
mother
i
hope
that
they
will
have
an
increased
sacredness
for
you
now
he
may
be
looking
down
on
you
from
heaven
added
victoria
folding
her
handkerchief
so
as
to
get
a
dry
part
uppermost
i
could
not
resist
this
provocation
i
smiled
if
it
is
so
victoria
i
remarked
nobody
will
be
more
surprised
than
the
prince
himself
victoria
was
very
much
offended
she
conceived
herself
to
have
added
an
effective
touch
i
ridiculed
her
you
might
at
least
pretend
to
have
a
little
decent
feeling
she
cried
come
come
my
dear
do
let
squabble
over
him
before
he
cold
said
i
rising
have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
mother
at
this
instant
my
entered
he
smelt
very
strongly
of
tobacco
but
wore
an
expression
of
premeditated
misery
he
came
up
to
me
holding
out
his
hand
good
evening
said
i
poor
hammerfeldt
he
murmured
poor
hammerfeldt
what
a
blow
how
lost
you
must
feel
he
had
been
talking
over
the
matter
with
victoria
that
was
beyond
doubt
i
happen
to
have
been
thinking
i
rejoined
more
of
him
than
of
myself
of
course
of
course
muttered
william
adolphus
in
some
confusion
and
as
i
thought
with
a
reproachful
glance
at
his
wife
we
have
lost
the
prince
said
my
mother
but
we
can
still
be
guided
by
his
example
and
his
principles
to
follow
his
counsels
will
be
the
best
monument
you
can
raise
to
his
memory
augustin
i
kissed
her
hand
and
then
she
gave
me
her
cheek
going
to
victoria
i
saluted
her
with
brotherly
heartiness
i
never
allowed
myself
to
forget
that
victoria
was
very
fond
of
me
and
i
never
lost
my
affection
for
her
now
do
be
foolish
augustin
she
implored
what
is
being
foolish
i
asked
perversely
oh
you
know
you
know
very
well
what
people
say
and
so
do
i
and
poor
old
hammerfeldt
in
heaven
does
he
know
too
she
turned
away
with
a
shocked
expression
william
adolphus
hid
a
sheepish
smile
with
a
large
hand
in
the
lower
ranges
of
humour
william
adolphus
sometimes
understood
one
i
declined
his
offer
of
company
over
a
cigar
but
bade
him
with
a
mild
gratitude
he
desired
to
be
pleasant
to
us
all
and
the
realization
of
his
ambition
presented
difficulties
i
was
very
tired
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
almost
the
moment
i
was
in
bed
at
four
in
the
morning
i
awoke
my
fatigue
seemed
gone
i
did
not
think
of
sleeping
again
the
events
of
the
day
before
came
back
to
me
with
an
extraordinary
vividness
of
impression
the
outcome
of
nerves
strained
to
an
unhealthy
sensitiveness
it
would
have
needed
but
a
little
a
little
yielding
to
the
current
of
my
thoughts
to
make
me
see
hammerfeldt
by
my
bed
the
countess
and
wetter
were
in
mental
image
no
less
plain
i
rose
and
pulled
up
the
blinds
the
night
had
begun
to
pass
from
black
to
gray
for
a
moment
i
pictured
the
prince
not
looking
down
from
heaven
but
wandering
somewhere
in
such
a
dim
cold
twilight
the
message
that
his
eyes
had
given
me
became
very
clear
to
me
it
had
turned
my
cheek
red
it
sent
an
excitement
through
me
now
it
would
not
go
easily
into
words
but
as
i
sought
to
frame
it
that
other
speech
came
back
to
me
the
speech
of
the
prince
enemy
wetter
had
said
you
king
at
last
what
else
had
hammerfeldt
meant
to
say
nothing
else
that
was
his
message
also
from
both
it
came
the
same
reminder
the
same
exhortation
the
living
man
and
the
dead
joined
their
voices
in
this
brief
appeal
it
did
not
need
my
mother
despair
or
victoria
petulance
to
lend
it
point
i
was
amazed
to
find
how
it
came
home
to
me
now
i
perceived
how
up
to
this
time
my
life
had
been
centred
in
hammerfeldt
i
was
obeying
him
or
disobeying
accepting
his
views
or
questioning
them
docile
or
rebellious
when
i
rebelled
i
rebelled
for
the
pleasure
of
it
for
the
excitement
it
gave
the
spice
of
daring
the
air
of
independence
for
curiosity
to
see
how
he
would
take
it
what
saying
he
would
utter
what
resource
of
persuasion
or
argument
he
would
invoke
it
was
strange
to
think
that
now
if
i
obeyed
i
should
not
gratify
if
i
disobeyed
i
could
make
him
uneasy
no
more
if
i
went
right
there
was
none
to
reap
credit
if
i
went
wrong
none
who
should
have
controlled
me
better
none
to
say
you
are
wise
sire
none
to
smile
as
he
said
we
must
all
learn
wisdom
sire
it
was
very
strange
to
be
without
old
hammerfeldt
you
king
at
last
by
wetter
verdict
and
by
the
prince
own
his
death
made
me
in
very
truth
king
so
they
said
what
did
they
think
wetter
thought
was
here
is
a
king
a
king
to
be
shaped
and
used
i
read
wetter
thought
well
enough
but
the
old
man
his
was
a
plea
a
hope
a
prayer
be
king
a
sudden
flash
of
feeling
came
upon
me
too
late
for
i
had
gone
to
his
bedside
fresh
from
signing
my
abdication
it
mattered
nothing
at
whose
bidding
or
with
what
eager
obedience
i
had
taken
off
the
crown
my
sovereignty
was
my
possession
and
my
trust
i
had
laid
it
down
in
those
dim
hours
of
the
night
when
men
die
so
they
say
passion
is
cold
the
blood
chill
and
we
fall
prey
to
the
cruelties
of
truth
then
i
knew
to
what
i
had
put
my
hand
why
wetter
exulted
why
hammerfeldt
eyes
spoke
one
unspoken
prayer
it
was
not
that
wetter
went
ambassador
but
that
he
went
not
of
my
will
by
my
act
or
out
of
my
mind
he
went
by
another
will
that
other
on
whose
head
i
had
put
my
crown
strange
thoughts
for
a
man
not
yet
grown
i
am
not
altogether
of
that
mind
for
then
my
trust
seemed
very
great
almost
holy
armed
with
majesty
i
had
not
learned
the
little
real
power
that
lay
in
it
if
i
threw
away
my
crown
i
should
not
exaggerate
the
value
of
my
sacrifice
then
it
seemed
that
i
gave
a
great
thing
and
great
was
my
betrayal
therefore
i
could
not
rest
for
the
thought
of
what
i
had
put
my
hand
to
chafed
at
wetter
words
that
sounded
now
like
a
taunt
and
seemed
again
to
see
old
hammerfeldt
dying
and
to
flush
red
in
shame
before
the
utterance
of
his
eyes
the
prince
had
served
his
masters
his
country
and
the
cause
that
he
held
right
wetter
if
he
served
himself
served
his
principles
also
what
and
whom
did
i
serve
in
this
thing
that
i
was
about
to
do
i
could
answer
only
that
i
served
her
whose
image
rose
now
before
me
but
when
i
turned
to
her
for
comfort
she
accused
and
did
not
delight
i
am
aware
that
my
feelings
will
probably
appear
exaggerated
to
those
not
brought
up
in
the
habit
of
thought
nor
subjected
to
the
influences
which
had
ruled
my
mind
i
give
them
for
what
they
are
worth
at
this
moment
the
effect
of
the
contrast
between
my
position
and
my
desires
was
a
struggle
of
peculiar
severity
one
of
the
battles
of
my
life
irony
was
not
to
be
wanting
comedy
claimed
her
accustomed
share
the
interview
which
i
have
already
set
down
might
seem
enough
to
have
satisfied
my
sister
it
was
not
after
i
had
breakfasted
victoria
sent
william
adolphus
to
me
i
am
inclined
now
and
then
to
think
that
there
is
after
all
something
mystic
in
the
status
of
husbandhood
some
supernatural
endowment
that
in
the
wife
eyes
attaches
to
her
own
man
however
little
she
values
him
at
however
low
a
rate
she
sets
his
natural
qualities
how
otherwise
could
victoria
whose
defect
was
more
in
temper
than
in
perception
send
william
adolphus
to
talk
to
me
he
came
the
of
the
man
of
the
world
was
his
choice
i
a
bit
older
than
you
you
know
he
began
then
he
laughed
and
said
that
women
were
all
very
well
in
their
places
i
must
not
suppose
that
he
was
a
puritan
heavens
i
supposed
nothing
about
him
i
knew
he
was
a
fool
and
rested
in
that
sufficient
knowledge
the
countess
he
said
was
a
damned
pretty
woman
we
sha
quarrel
about
that
anyhow
he
added
with
the
sort
of
laugh
that
i
had
so
often
seen
poor
old
hammerfeldt
wince
at
but
come
now
did
i
mean
to
well
i
knew
what
he
meant
did
i
my
dear
william
adolphus
said
i
i
am
so
infinitely
obliged
to
you
you
have
made
me
see
the
matter
in
quite
a
new
light
it
surprising
what
a
talk
with
a
man
of
the
world
does
for
one
i
am
very
young
of
course
oh
you
learn
you
no
fool
said
william
adolphus
i
suppose
victoria
does
know
you
come
he
turned
rather
red
and
like
a
fool
lied
where
he
need
not
out
of
pride
not
policy
no
i
came
off
my
own
bat
he
answered
you
have
done
me
a
great
service
my
dear
fellow
beamed
he
with
the
broadest
of
smiles
now
hammerfeldt
gone
i
thought
a
friendly
word
or
two
would
not
come
amiss
hammerfeldt
was
dead
now
came
william
adolphus
a
pas
of
course
you
can
do
nothing
abrupt
he
continued
but
i
should
think
you
might
gradually
i
understand
you
absolutely
said
i
rising
to
my
feet
what
i
mean
is
my
dear
fellow
not
another
word
is
needed
you
do
mind
if
i
mention
to
victoria
that
i
have
put
it
in
the
evening
papers
if
you
like
said
i
ha
ha
he
laughed
that
would
be
a
bad
joke
would
it
what
a
man
with
his
little
bit
of
stock
wisdom
you
can
do
nothing
abruptly
nothing
abruptly
i
must
not
check
myself
abruptly
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
but
go
quietly
down
to
the
gulf
and
then
come
up
again
if
i
were
ever
to
do
anything
it
must
be
done
abruptly
now
while
the
strength
was
on
me
while
there
was
still
a
force
fresh
and
vigorous
to
match
the
other
great
force
that
drew
me
on
and
across
this
consciousness
came
a
queer
little
remorse
for
not
having
rescued
victoria
from
this
husband
whom
she
sent
to
teach
me
when
baptiste
brought
me
lunch
i
was
laughing
that
afternoon
the
thought
of
geoffrey
owen
was
much
with
me
perhaps
i
summoned
it
first
in
a
sort
of
appeal
against
hammerfeldt
but
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
the
two
could
not
be
antagonists
here
geoffrey
would
wish
me
to
show
favour
or
at
least
impartiality
toward
liberal
opinions
for
the
sake
of
such
a
manifestation
he
might
overlook
certain
objections
and
acquiesce
in
my
giving
the
embassy
to
wetter
but
with
what
face
would
he
hear
an
honest
statement
of
the
case
that
wetter
was
to
have
the
embassy
because
the
king
desired
to
please
countess
von
sempach
i
smiled
drearily
as
i
imagined
his
incredulous
indignation
no
everybody
was
against
me
saints
and
sages
geoffrey
and
hammerfeldt
women
and
men
even
the
fools
gave
no
countenance
to
my
folly
william
adolphus
thought
that
i
might
gradually
at
five
i
sent
for
wetter
he
came
with
remarkable
promptness
he
was
visibly
excited
and
could
hardly
force
himself
to
spend
a
moment
on
the
formal
and
proper
expressions
of
regret
for
the
prince
death
he
seemed
to
be
watching
me
closely
and
eagerly
i
made
him
sit
down
and
gave
him
a
cigar
i
had
meant
to
approach
the
matter
with
a
diplomatic
deviousness
i
had
overrated
my
skill
and
wetter
made
me
feel
young
and
awkward
i
was
like
a
schoolboy
forced
to
confess
the
neglect
of
his
task
and
speaking
in
fear
of
the
cane
ignoring
the
reserve
that
had
marked
our
former
conversation
i
blurted
out
i
ca
send
you
to
paris
the
man
face
went
white
but
he
controlled
himself
your
majesty
knows
that
i
did
not
ask
for
it
he
said
with
considerable
dignity
i
know
but
you
wanted
it
he
looked
straight
at
me
he
was
very
pale
truly
yes
he
said
i
wanted
it
since
your
majesty
is
plain
be
plain
too
why
did
you
want
it
why
are
you
pale
wetter
he
put
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
smoked
fiercely
but
did
not
answer
you
must
have
wanted
it
i
said
or
you
would
have
tried
to
get
it
in
that
way
my
god
i
did
want
it
why
if
i
ca
have
it
what
matter
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
bowed
sire
said
he
then
he
gave
a
curious
laugh
te
he
added
laughing
still
what
the
matter
man
i
cried
springing
up
and
catching
him
by
the
arm
i
have
a
shilling
in
the
world
my
creditors
are
in
full
chase
posted
for
a
card
debt
at
the
club
if
i
had
this
i
could
borrow
good
god
you
promised
it
to
her
yes
i
promised
it
to
her
have
you
seen
her
again
no
i
must
to
whom
will
you
give
it
i
do
know
not
to
you
why
not
you
not
fit
for
it
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
forehead
i
was
no
more
fit
for
it
yesterday
he
said
i
wo
argue
it
as
you
please
sire
said
he
with
a
shrug
and
he
seemed
to
pull
himself
together
he
rose
and
stood
before
me
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
i
sat
down
took
a
piece
of
paper
wrote
a
draft
leaving
the
amount
unstated
and
pushed
it
across
to
him
he
looked
down
at
it
in
wonder
then
his
face
lit
up
with
eagerness
you
mean
you
mean
he
stammered
my
ransom
said
i
mine
he
cried
no
it
is
mine
the
price
of
my
freedom
illustration
my
ransom
said
i
the
price
of
my
freedom
he
lifted
the
piece
of
paper
in
a
hand
that
trembled
it
a
lot
of
money
he
said
eighty
or
ninety
thousand
marks
my
name
is
good
for
that
he
looked
me
in
the
face
opening
his
lips
but
not
speaking
then
he
thrust
out
his
hand
to
me
i
took
it
i
was
as
much
moved
as
he
do
tempt
me
again
i
said
he
gripped
my
hand
hard
and
fiercely
when
he
released
it
i
waved
it
toward
the
door
i
could
trust
myself
no
more
he
turned
to
go
but
i
called
to
him
again
do
say
anything
to
her
i
must
see
her
he
faced
me
with
an
agitated
look
what
for
he
asked
i
made
him
no
answer
but
lay
back
in
my
chair
he
came
toward
me
slowly
and
with
hesitation
i
looked
up
in
his
face
i
pay
you
back
he
said
i
do
want
the
money
and
i
do
mean
the
money
in
fact
i
bad
at
paying
money
back
why
have
you
done
it
i
have
done
it
for
myself
not
for
you
you
owe
me
nothing
my
honour
was
pawned
and
i
have
redeemed
it
i
was
bound
i
am
free
his
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
me
with
a
sort
of
wonder
but
i
motioned
him
again
to
the
door
he
obeyed
me
without
another
word
after
a
bow
he
turned
and
went
out
i
rose
and
having
walked
to
the
window
looked
down
into
the
street
i
saw
him
crossing
the
roadway
with
a
slow
step
and
bent
head
he
was
going
toward
his
club
not
to
his
house
i
stood
watching
him
till
he
turned
round
a
corner
and
disappeared
then
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
returned
to
my
chair
i
had
hardly
seated
myself
when
baptiste
came
in
with
a
note
it
was
from
the
countess
are
you
coming
that
was
all
there
is
no
answer
i
said
and
baptiste
left
me
for
i
must
carry
the
answer
myself
and
the
answer
must
be
yes
but
not
there
was
doubtless
some
extravagance
in
my
conception
of
the
situation
and
i
have
not
sought
to
conceal
or
modify
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
play
my
part
only
at
the
cost
of
what
was
dearest
to
me
in
the
world
money
had
served
with
wetter
it
would
not
serve
here
my
heart
must
pay
my
heart
and
hers
i
remember
that
i
sat
in
my
chair
murmuring
again
and
again
but
not
chapter
xiii
i
promise
not
to
laugh
i
take
it
that
generally
when
middle
age
looks
back
on
the
emotions
of
youth
and
its
temptations
it
is
to
smile
at
the
wildness
of
the
first
and
to
marvel
at
the
victories
of
the
second
that
is
not
my
mood
when
i
recall
the
relation
between
the
countess
and
myself
for
sometimes
while
passion
becomes
less
fierce
aspiration
grows
less
exalted
the
man
who
calls
most
if
not
all
things
vanity
will
yield
to
desires
which
some
ideal
in
the
boy
would
rout
at
forty
the
feelings
are
not
so
strong
as
at
twenty
but
neither
are
the
ambitions
the
dreams
the
conception
of
self
it
is
easier
to
resist
but
it
may
not
seem
so
well
worth
while
thus
it
is
with
me
i
wonder
not
at
the
beginning
or
progress
of
my
first
love
but
at
the
manner
of
its
end
asking
myself
incredulously
what
motive
or
what
notion
had
power
to
hold
back
the
flood
of
youth
seeking
almost
in
vain
to
the
spring
that
moved
me
then
yet
though
i
can
not
feel
it
again
i
know
dimly
what
it
was
that
high
strange
noble
ludicrous
ideal
of
my
office
which
so
laid
hold
on
me
as
to
scatter
passion
forces
and
wrest
me
from
the
arms
of
her
i
loved
i
can
not
now
so
think
of
my
kingship
so
magnify
its
claim
or
conceive
that
it
matters
so
greatly
to
the
world
how
i
hold
it
or
what
manner
of
man
i
show
myself
i
come
to
the
conclusion
though
it
may
seem
to
border
on
paradox
that
in
a
like
case
i
could
not
or
should
not
do
now
what
i
did
then
i
suppose
that
it
is
some
such
process
as
this
a
weakening
of
emotion
parallel
with
a
lowering
of
ideal
that
makes
us
as
we
grow
older
think
ourselves
so
much
wiser
and
know
ourselves
to
be
so
little
better
i
had
charged
wetter
to
say
nothing
to
the
countess
but
he
disobeyed
me
he
had
been
to
her
and
told
her
all
that
passed
between
us
i
knew
this
the
moment
i
entered
her
room
her
agitated
nervous
air
showed
me
that
she
had
been
informed
of
the
withdrawal
of
my
gift
was
aware
that
the
embassy
was
no
longer
hers
to
give
to
wetter
or
another
and
was
wondering
helplessly
what
the
meaning
of
the
change
might
be
to
her
as
to
wetter
the
death
of
hammerfeldt
must
have
seemed
the
removal
of
an
impediment
only
through
the
curious
processes
of
my
own
mind
did
it
raise
an
obstacle
insurmountable
she
had
liked
the
prince
but
feared
him
she
imagined
my
feelings
to
have
been
the
same
and
perhaps
in
his
lifetime
they
were
then
should
not
i
who
had
been
brought
to
defy
him
living
more
readily
disregard
him
dead
but
against
her
knowledge
of
me
and
her
quick
wit
no
preconception
could
hold
out
long
she
was
by
me
in
a
moment
asking
what
has
happened
what
wrong
augustin
i
had
pictured
myself
describing
to
her
what
i
felt
making
her
understand
sympathize
and
even
while
she
grieved
approve
the
notion
was
so
strong
in
me
that
i
did
not
doubt
of
finding
words
for
it
words
eloquent
of
its
force
and
dignity
but
before
her
simple
impulsive
question
i
was
dumb
a
wave
of
shyness
swept
over
me
not
even
to
her
could
i
divulge
my
thoughts
not
even
from
her
risk
the
smile
of
ridicule
or
the
blankness
of
i
became
wretchedly
certain
that
i
should
be
only
absurd
and
priggish
that
she
would
not
believe
me
would
see
only
excuse
and
hypocrisy
in
what
i
said
it
was
so
difficult
also
not
to
seem
to
accuse
her
to
charge
her
with
grasping
at
what
i
had
freely
offered
with
having
as
the
phrase
runs
designs
on
me
with
wishing
to
take
power
where
she
had
been
impelled
to
bestow
love
she
pressed
me
with
more
questions
but
still
i
found
no
answer
i
ca
do
it
i
was
reduced
to
stammering
i
ca
do
it
he
not
the
man
i
must
find
another
of
the
prince
party
she
asked
quickly
i
do
know
i
must
find
somebody
i
must
find
somebody
for
myself
i
had
sat
down
and
she
was
standing
opposite
to
me
find
somebody
for
yourself
she
repeated
slowly
for
yourself
what
do
you
mean
by
that
augustin
i
must
choose
a
man
for
myself
you
mean
you
mean
without
my
help
i
returned
no
answer
but
sat
looking
at
her
with
a
dreary
appealing
gaze
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
she
said
suddenly
you
have
offered
to
kiss
me
i
rose
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
she
stood
still
and
did
not
kiss
me
thank
you
she
said
i
asked
you
to
kiss
me
and
you
kissed
me
thank
you
she
paused
and
added
have
i
grown
so
much
older
in
a
day
it
is
not
that
it
it
is
that
she
said
she
turned
away
and
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
where
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
then
she
gave
a
short
laugh
i
knew
it
would
come
she
said
but
this
is
is
rather
sudden
i
ran
to
her
and
threw
myself
on
my
knees
by
her
i
lifted
my
arm
and
put
it
round
her
neck
and
drew
her
face
down
to
mine
no
no
no
i
whispered
passionately
it
not
that
she
let
me
kiss
her
now
many
times
and
presently
returned
my
kisses
her
breath
caught
in
gasps
and
she
clutched
my
hand
imploringly
you
do
love
me
she
murmured
yes
yes
then
why
why
why
do
you
do
this
she
drew
back
looking
in
my
face
in
a
bewildered
way
then
a
sudden
brightness
came
into
her
eyes
is
it
for
me
are
you
thinking
of
me
no
said
i
in
stubborn
honesty
i
was
not
thinking
of
you
do
she
cried
for
she
did
not
believe
me
what
do
i
care
i
cared
once
i
do
care
now
it
was
because
of
you
i
repeated
obstinately
then
tell
me
tell
me
because
i
believe
you
still
love
me
i
made
shift
to
tell
her
but
my
stumbling
words
belittled
the
great
conception
i
could
not
find
the
phrases
that
alone
might
convey
the
truth
to
her
but
i
held
on
trying
to
say
something
of
what
i
meant
i
never
tried
to
interfere
she
broke
in
once
i
made
you
interfere
i
myself
was
my
lame
answer
and
the
rest
i
said
was
as
lame
i
do
understand
she
murmured
forlornly
and
petulantly
oh
i
suppose
i
see
what
you
mean
in
a
way
but
i
do
believe
it
i
see
why
you
should
feel
like
that
about
it
do
men
feel
like
that
women
do
i
ca
help
it
i
pleaded
pressing
her
hand
she
drew
it
away
gently
and
what
will
it
mean
she
asked
am
i
never
to
see
you
often
often
i
hope
but
i
not
to
talk
to
you
about
about
important
things
things
we
both
care
about
i
felt
the
absurdity
of
such
a
position
the
abstract
made
concrete
is
so
often
made
absurd
then
you
wo
come
often
you
wo
care
about
coming
something
in
her
thoughts
made
her
flush
suddenly
she
met
my
eyes
and
took
courage
you
asked
a
good
deal
of
me
she
said
i
made
no
answer
she
understood
my
silence
she
rose
leaving
me
on
my
knees
i
threw
myself
on
the
sofa
and
she
went
to
the
hearthrug
she
knew
that
what
i
had
asked
of
her
i
asked
no
more
there
was
a
long
silence
between
us
at
last
she
spoke
in
a
very
low
voice
it
only
a
little
sooner
than
it
must
have
been
she
said
and
i
i
suppose
i
must
be
glad
that
it
come
home
to
me
now
instead
of
later
i
daresay
you
be
glad
of
that
too
augustin
how
are
we
to
live
how
are
we
to
meet
what
are
we
to
be
to
one
another
she
broke
out
the
next
moment
we
ca
go
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
do
know
you
do
know
yet
you
hard
as
iron
about
it
oh
i
daresay
right
you
must
be
it
only
a
little
sooner
she
turned
her
back
to
me
and
stood
looking
down
into
the
fire
i
was
trying
to
answer
her
question
to
realize
how
it
would
be
between
us
how
having
lived
in
the
real
we
must
now
dwell
in
the
unreal
with
one
another
i
was
wondering
how
i
could
meet
her
and
not
show
that
i
loved
her
how
i
could
love
her
and
yet
be
true
to
my
idol
the
conception
that
governed
me
suddenly
she
spoke
without
turning
or
lifting
her
head
whom
shall
you
send
to
paris
i
do
know
i
have
settled
wetter
mentioned
somebody
else
besides
himself
only
max
said
i
with
a
dreary
laugh
had
you
better
send
max
that
is
if
you
think
him
fit
for
it
i
thought
that
she
was
relieving
her
petulance
by
a
bitter
jest
but
a
moment
later
she
said
again
still
without
turning
round
send
max
i
rose
and
walked
slowly
to
where
she
stood
hearing
my
movement
she
faced
me
send
max
she
said
again
holding
out
her
hands
toward
me
clasped
together
i
i
ca
stay
here
like
in
the
way
you
say
and
you
how
could
you
do
it
you
would
go
with
him
i
exclaimed
of
course
for
five
years
when
i
come
back
she
said
you
will
be
you
will
be
married
to
elsa
i
shall
be
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
how
we
are
to
treat
one
another
when
i
come
back
augustin
my
god
i
murmured
looking
in
her
eyes
as
i
looked
they
filled
with
tears
my
dear
my
dear
she
said
raising
her
arms
and
setting
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
i
have
never
forgotten
that
i
was
a
fool
yes
once
for
a
few
moments
yesterday
i
shall
remember
at
paris
what
a
fool
i
was
and
i
sha
forget
it
when
i
come
back
only
i
wish
it
did
break
one
heart
to
be
a
fool
i
wo
let
you
go
i
wo
send
him
i
ca
will
it
be
better
to
have
it
happen
here
gradually
before
my
eyes
every
day
i
should
kill
myself
i
could
bear
it
i
should
see
you
finding
out
changing
forgetting
laughing
oh
what
a
miserable
woman
i
am
she
turned
away
suddenly
and
flung
herself
into
an
armchair
why
did
you
do
it
she
cried
why
did
you
i
loved
you
yes
yes
yes
that
the
absurdity
the
horrible
absurdity
and
i
loved
you
and
i
love
you
is
it
funny
she
laughed
hysterically
how
funny
we
shall
think
it
soon
when
i
come
back
from
paris
no
before
then
we
shall
laugh
about
it
she
broke
into
sobs
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
i
shall
never
laugh
about
it
i
said
sha
you
she
asked
looking
up
and
gazing
intently
at
me
then
she
rose
and
came
toward
me
no
i
do
think
you
will
do
dear
but
i
do
think
you
will
you
wo
laugh
about
it
will
you
you
laugh
c√¶sar
i
bent
low
and
kissed
her
hand
i
should
have
broken
down
had
i
tried
to
speak
as
i
raised
my
head
from
her
hand
she
kissed
my
brow
then
she
wiped
her
eyes
saying
you
send
max
to
paris
you
promised
me
this
embassy
you
shall
be
good
and
great
and
independent
and
all
you
say
you
mean
to
be
and
must
be
afterward
but
you
promised
me
this
embassy
well
i
ask
your
promise
of
you
i
ask
it
for
max
you
would
go
away
from
me
yes
i
want
to
grow
old
away
from
you
i
ask
the
embassy
for
max
i
stood
silent
wretched
undecided
she
came
near
to
me
again
do
refuse
me
dear
she
said
in
a
low
unsteady
voice
i
do
ask
much
of
you
just
to
let
me
go
and
not
to
laugh
i
shall
never
ask
anything
again
of
you
i
have
given
you
so
much
and
i
would
have
given
you
anything
you
asked
do
refuse
me
it
breaks
my
heart
poor
heart
poor
heart
she
whispered
softly
with
a
sad
mocking
smile
it
will
mend
c√¶sar
you
you
mean
it
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
then
so
be
it
she
came
to
me
and
held
out
her
arms
i
clasped
her
in
mine
and
we
kissed
one
another
then
both
of
us
sat
down
again
and
there
was
silence
only
once
she
spoke
how
soon
shall
we
go
she
asked
in
about
three
weeks
or
a
month
i
suppose
i
answered
we
were
sitting
silent
when
we
heard
a
step
on
the
stairs
hark
she
said
it
max
step
she
rose
quickly
and
turned
the
lamp
lower
then
seated
herself
in
shadow
may
i
tell
him
about
it
now
she
asked
yes
if
it
must
be
so
yes
it
must
she
kissed
her
hand
to
me
saying
the
door
opened
and
max
von
sempach
came
in
before
he
could
greet
me
she
began
max
what
do
you
think
brings
the
king
here
max
professed
himself
at
a
loss
he
come
about
you
she
said
we
been
talking
about
you
have
you
what
about
me
he
asked
going
up
to
her
she
rose
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
the
king
is
going
to
give
our
side
a
turn
she
said
with
a
marvellous
composure
and
even
an
appearance
of
gaiety
what
cried
max
are
you
going
to
send
wetter
to
paris
sire
no
said
i
not
wetter
he
does
want
it
now
and
anyhow
he
not
fit
for
it
he
does
want
it
oh
but
he
does
max
you
must
contradict
the
king
but
one
of
our
people
is
to
have
it
guess
who
it
is
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
know
who
it
is
if
it
not
wetter
it
you
she
said
is
it
sire
if
he
likes
it
said
i
do
you
like
it
like
it
he
exclaimed
oh
but
i
ca
believe
it
something
of
the
sort
has
been
the
dream
of
my
life
it
is
yours
if
you
will
have
it
said
i
and
the
dream
of
your
life
will
come
true
she
said
fancy
that
i
did
know
it
ever
happened
and
she
glanced
at
me
yes
the
dream
of
his
life
shall
come
true
said
i
you
very
fit
for
it
and
i
very
glad
to
give
it
to
one
of
your
side
the
king
belongs
to
no
party
said
she
she
paused
and
added
and
to
no
person
he
stands
apart
and
alone
i
hardly
heeded
max
profuse
thanks
and
honest
open
exultation
it
too
good
to
be
true
said
he
this
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
strange
little
scene
between
us
three
the
accepted
conventions
of
emotion
required
that
it
should
raise
in
me
and
in
her
a
feeling
of
remorse
for
max
was
so
honest
so
simple
so
exclusively
given
over
to
gratitude
so
far
as
i
recollect
however
i
had
no
such
feeling
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
countess
differed
from
me
in
this
respect
i
was
envious
of
him
not
because
he
took
her
with
him
for
he
did
not
take
her
love
but
simply
because
he
had
got
something
he
liked
was
very
pleased
and
in
a
good
temper
with
the
world
and
himself
the
dream
of
his
life
as
he
declared
impetuously
was
fulfilled
the
dream
of
ours
was
shattered
how
were
we
to
reproach
ourselves
on
his
account
it
would
have
been
the
quixotry
of
conscience
i
daresay
you
wo
like
it
so
much
as
you
think
said
i
with
a
childish
desire
to
make
him
a
little
less
comfortable
oh
yes
i
shall
and
you
like
it
wo
you
he
turned
to
his
wife
affectionately
as
if
i
should
let
you
take
it
if
i
did
like
it
she
answered
smiling
think
how
i
shall
show
off
before
all
my
good
countrywomen
in
paris
i
do
know
how
to
thank
your
majesty
said
max
i
do
want
any
thanks
i
have
done
it
for
thanks
i
thought
you
the
best
man
no
no
he
murmured
i
like
to
think
it
partly
friendship
for
my
wife
and
me
everybody
will
say
so
i
looked
up
with
a
little
start
i
suppose
they
will
said
i
yes
you
be
handsomely
abused
that
be
rather
funny
i
remarked
almost
unconsciously
as
i
looked
across
to
the
countess
smiling
i
mean
you
do
mind
my
saying
asked
max
and
when
i
nodded
he
went
on
they
point
out
that
you
turning
to
our
side
the
moment
that
the
prince
is
dead
yes
it
will
make
a
good
deal
of
talk
call
it
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
perhaps
they
be
right
said
she
in
a
low
voice
i
rose
to
my
feet
i
recognised
the
truth
in
what
max
said
and
it
seemed
to
add
a
touch
of
irony
that
the
situation
had
lacked
hammerfeldt
himself
if
he
looked
down
from
heaven
as
victoria
picturesquely
suggested
would
be
amused
at
the
interpretation
put
on
my
action
it
would
suit
his
humour
well
to
see
the
great
sacrifice
that
i
had
made
at
the
shrine
of
his
teaching
twisted
into
a
repudiation
of
his
views
and
a
prompt
defiance
of
the
authority
which
he
in
life
had
exercised
his
partisans
would
be
furious
with
me
they
would
say
i
flouted
his
memory
that
would
be
strange
to
hear
when
the
figure
of
the
countess
was
still
fresh
before
my
eyes
and
the
sound
of
her
sobs
rang
yet
in
my
ears
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
there
are
harder
things
to
bear
than
a
little
abuse
and
a
little
gossip
i
ca
help
it
if
they
do
understand
the
grounds
of
my
action
it
so
soon
after
the
prince
death
said
max
the
thing
could
not
be
delayed
it
had
to
be
done
at
once
said
i
moved
toward
her
to
take
my
leave
she
was
standing
close
by
her
husband
side
her
face
was
still
in
shadow
we
shall
have
so
much
to
do
before
we
go
she
said
that
we
can
hope
to
see
very
little
more
of
your
majesty
yes
broke
in
max
we
must
go
down
and
arrange
everything
on
the
estate
we
going
to
be
away
for
so
long
oh
but
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
again
you
must
come
and
say
to
me
now
i
must
leave
you
and
again
thank
you
she
said
she
came
with
me
to
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
max
walked
in
front
and
went
on
to
open
the
door
and
see
that
my
carriage
was
in
readiness
for
an
instant
i
clasped
her
hand
i
sha
see
you
again
she
whispered
i
left
her
standing
on
the
lowest
step
her
head
proudly
erect
and
a
smile
on
her
lips
it
was
as
she
said
i
did
not
see
her
again
for
they
went
to
the
country
the
next
day
and
when
max
came
to
take
a
formal
leave
of
me
she
excused
herself
on
the
score
of
indisposition
to
complete
the
picture
i
ought
to
describe
the
wrath
of
those
who
had
formed
hammerfeldt
the
gleeful
satisfaction
of
the
opposing
party
the
articles
in
the
journals
the
speculations
guesses
and
assertions
as
to
my
reasons
temper
intention
and
expressions
i
should
paint
also
my
mother
mingled
annoyance
and
relief
vexation
that
i
favoured
the
liberals
and
joy
that
the
countess
von
sempach
went
to
paris
victoria
absolute
bewilderment
and
ineffectual
divings
and
fishings
for
anything
that
might
throw
light
on
so
mysterious
a
matter
william
adolphus
intense
in
my
following
of
his
advice
accompanied
by
a
patronizing
rebuke
for
my
having
thought
it
necessary
to
do
it
so
abruptly
all
these
good
people
as
they
acted
their
little
parts
and
filled
their
corners
of
the
stage
had
their
own
ideas
of
the
meaning
of
the
play
and
their
own
estimate
of
the
importance
of
the
characters
they
all
fitted
into
their
places
in
my
conception
of
it
so
that
not
one
was
superfluous
all
were
needed
and
all
worked
in
unconsciousness
to
heighten
the
irony
to
point
the
comedy
and
to
frame
the
tragedy
in
its
most
effective
most
incongruous
setting
for
in
this
real
life
the
takes
no
pains
to
have
all
things
in
harmony
nor
to
lead
us
through
gradual
and
emotions
to
the
climax
of
exalted
feeling
nor
to
banish
from
our
sight
all
that
jars
and
clashes
with
the
pathos
of
the
piece
rather
he
works
by
contrasts
by
strange
juxtapositions
by
surprises
careless
how
many
of
the
audience
follow
his
mind
not
heeding
dissatisfaction
or
pleasure
recking
nothing
whether
we
applaud
or
damn
his
play
well
here
was
i
augustin
twenty
years
of
age
and
determined
to
reign
alone
and
my
countess
was
gone
to
paris
did
you
look
down
from
heaven
old
hammerfeldt
victoria
thought
you
did
well
then
was
not
the
work
absurdly
extravagantly
bravely
done
chapter
xiv
pleasure
takes
leave
to
protest
during
the
months
that
followed
the
departure
of
the
sempachs
i
engaged
myself
busily
in
public
affairs
in
the
endeavour
to
gain
better
acquaintance
with
the
difficult
trade
which
was
mine
i
do
not
throw
off
impressions
lightly
and
i
was
disinclined
for
gaiety
or
for
more
society
than
the
obligations
of
my
position
demanded
my
mother
approved
of
my
zeal
a
convinced
partisan
she
enjoyed
that
happy
confidence
in
her
own
views
which
makes
people
certain
that
everybody
can
study
their
opinions
only
to
embrace
them
attention
is
the
sole
preliminary
to
conversion
i
will
not
speak
further
of
this
matter
here
than
to
say
that
i
was
doomed
to
disappoint
princess
heinrich
in
this
respect
i
am
glad
of
it
the
world
moves
and
although
it
is
very
difficult
for
persons
so
artificially
situated
as
i
have
been
to
move
with
it
yet
we
can
and
must
move
after
it
lumbering
along
in
its
wake
more
or
less
slowly
and
awkwardly
we
hold
on
this
tenure
if
we
do
not
perform
it
well
we
end
in
in
england
it
was
i
suppose
owing
to
these
occupations
that
i
failed
to
notice
the
relations
between
victoria
and
her
husband
until
they
had
reached
a
rather
acute
crisis
either
from
a
desire
to
the
number
of
my
guardian
angels
or
merely
because
they
found
themselves
very
comfortable
the
pair
had
taken
up
a
practically
permanent
residence
with
me
i
was
very
glad
to
have
them
and
assigned
them
a
handsome
set
of
apartments
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
here
they
lived
in
considerable
splendour
seeing
a
great
deal
of
company
and
assuming
the
position
of
social
leaders
victoria
at
least
was
admirably
suited
to
play
such
a
part
and
i
certainly
did
not
grudge
it
to
her
for
my
mother
i
can
not
speak
so
confidently
william
adolphus
having
abandoned
his
military
pursuits
led
an
idle
lounging
life
in
consequence
he
grew
indolent
his
stoutness
increased
i
mention
this
personal
detail
merely
because
i
believe
that
it
had
a
considerable
influence
on
victoria
feelings
toward
him
her
varied
nature
included
a
vivid
streak
of
the
romantic
and
with
every
expansion
in
his
belt
and
every
multiplication
of
the
folds
of
his
chin
william
adolphus
came
to
satisfy
this
instinct
in
her
less
and
less
she
sought
other
interests
she
contrived
to
combine
very
dexterously
the
with
the
leader
of
fashion
she
posed
as
a
patron
of
letters
and
the
arts
indulging
in
intellectual
flirtations
with
professors
and
other
learned
folk
there
was
no
harm
in
this
and
william
adolphus
would
not
have
been
in
the
smallest
degree
disturbed
by
it
he
had
all
the
given
by
a
complete
want
of
imagination
unhappily
however
she
began
to
treat
him
with
something
very
like
contempt
allowed
him
to
perceive
that
his
company
did
not
satisfy
her
spiritual
and
mental
requirements
and
showed
herself
more
than
willing
that
he
should
choose
his
own
associates
and
dispose
of
his
own
time
he
was
not
resentful
he
confessed
that
his
wife
friends
bored
him
and
availed
himself
amply
and
of
the
liberty
which
her
expressed
preferences
afforded
him
he
devoted
himself
to
his
sport
his
dogs
and
his
horses
this
was
all
very
well
he
also
became
a
noted
patron
of
the
lighter
forms
of
the
drama
this
for
reasons
that
i
shall
indicate
directly
was
not
quite
so
well
out
of
this
last
taste
of
william
adolphus
came
the
strained
relations
between
his
wife
and
himself
to
which
i
have
referred
among
those
who
have
crossed
my
path
few
have
stamped
themselves
more
clearly
on
my
memory
than
coralie
mansoni
she
was
by
no
means
so
great
a
force
in
my
life
as
was
the
countess
von
sempach
but
she
remains
a
singularly
vivid
image
before
my
eyes
born
heaven
knew
where
and
of
parents
whom
i
doubt
whether
she
herself
could
name
seeming
to
hail
from
the
borderland
of
italy
and
france
a
daughter
of
the
riviera
she
had
strayed
and
tumbled
through
a
youth
of
which
she
would
speak
in
moments
of
expansion
i
however
need
say
nothing
of
it
when
i
saw
her
first
she
was
playing
a
small
part
in
a
light
opera
at
forstadt
a
few
weeks
later
she
had
assumed
leading
and
was
the
idol
of
the
young
men
she
was
then
about
tall
dark
of
full
figure
doomed
to
a
brevity
of
beauty
but
at
the
moment
magnificence
itself
every
intellectual
gift
she
appeared
to
lack
except
a
strangely
persistent
resolution
of
purpose
and
an
admirably
lucid
conception
of
her
own
interest
she
was
not
in
the
least
brilliant
or
even
amusing
in
general
conversation
she
worshipped
her
own
beauty
she
owed
to
it
all
she
was
and
paid
the
debt
with
a
defiant
assertion
of
its
supremacy
none
could
contradict
her
she
was
very
lazy
as
regards
physical
exertion
extremely
fond
of
eating
and
drinking
a
careful
manager
of
her
money
all
this
sounds
and
was
very
unattractive
on
the
other
side
of
the
account
may
be
put
a
certain
simplicity
an
indolent
kindness
a
desire
to
make
folks
comfortable
and
what
i
liked
most
a
mental
honesty
which
caused
her
to
assess
both
herself
and
other
people
with
a
nearness
to
her
and
their
real
value
that
was
at
times
absolutely
startling
it
seemed
as
though
a
person
otherwise
neither
clever
nor
of
signally
high
character
had
been
gifted
with
a
which
allowed
her
to
read
hearts
and
a
relentless
fine
sincerity
that
forced
her
to
declare
what
she
read
to
all
who
cared
to
listen
to
her
whatever
she
did
or
did
not
in
that
queer
life
of
hers
she
never
flattered
man
or
woman
and
fashioned
no
false
image
of
herself
william
adolphus
made
her
the
rage
so
strangely
things
fall
out
he
went
five
nights
running
to
see
her
next
week
came
a
new
piece
with
coralie
in
the
chief
part
my
had
sent
for
her
to
his
box
he
was
a
prince
a
great
man
exalted
of
what
seemed
boundless
wealth
coralie
was
languidly
polite
william
adolphus
broad
face
must
have
worn
a
luxurious
smile
he
did
coralie
the
honour
of
calling
on
her
at
her
pretty
villa
where
she
lived
with
her
oddly
selected
relationship
madame
briande
he
was
received
with
acquiescence
enthusiasm
was
not
among
coralie
accomplishments
however
she
lazily
drawled
out
the
opinion
that
was
william
adolphus
mounted
into
the
seventh
heaven
he
came
home
and
did
not
tell
his
wife
where
he
had
been
this
silence
was
significant
as
a
rule
if
he
but
visited
the
tailor
or
had
his
hair
cut
he
told
everybody
all
about
it
he
had
really
no
idea
that
some
things
were
uninteresting
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
this
trait
constitutes
exactly
a
peculiarity
my
and
i
were
very
good
friends
he
proposed
that
i
should
accompany
him
to
the
theatre
and
afterward
be
his
guest
for
he
was
to
entertain
coralie
at
supper
but
where
i
asked
with
a
smile
there
is
an
excellent
restaurant
where
i
have
a
private
room
he
confessed
and
they
do
know
you
of
course
they
know
me
i
mean
where
they
would
be
willing
to
know
neither
you
nor
me
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
that
all
right
so
i
went
with
william
adolphus
several
men
whom
i
knew
were
present
among
them
wetter
and
le
vicomte
de
varvilliers
second
secretary
of
the
french
embassy
and
a
mirror
of
fashion
we
were
quite
informal
varvilliers
sat
on
my
left
and
employed
himself
in
giving
me
an
account
of
my
neighbour
coralie
i
listened
absently
for
the
sight
of
wetter
had
stirred
other
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
had
not
yet
spoken
to
coralie
my
monopolized
her
i
ought
to
speak
to
her
i
suppose
i
said
to
varvilliers
at
last
a
thousand
pardons
for
engrossing
your
majesty
he
cried
yes
i
think
you
should
william
adolphus
voice
flowed
on
in
the
account
of
a
match
between
one
of
his
horses
and
one
of
somebody
else
i
turned
to
follow
varvilliers
advice
rather
to
my
surprise
i
found
coralie
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
an
appearance
of
faint
amusement
she
began
to
address
me
without
waiting
for
me
to
say
anything
why
do
you
listen
to
what
varvilliers
says
about
me
instead
of
finding
out
about
me
yourself
she
asked
how
do
you
know
he
talked
of
you
mademoiselle
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
returned
to
her
salad
william
adolphus
asked
her
a
question
she
nodded
without
looking
up
from
the
salad
i
began
to
eat
my
salad
it
a
good
salad
i
observed
after
a
few
mouthfuls
very
said
coralie
she
turned
her
great
eyes
on
me
and
what
a
rare
thing
she
added
with
a
sigh
probably
she
would
expect
a
touch
of
gallantry
the
perfection
of
everything
is
rare
said
i
looking
pointedly
in
her
face
she
put
up
her
hand
lightly
fingered
the
curls
on
her
forehead
smiled
at
me
and
turned
again
to
her
salad
i
laughed
she
looked
up
again
quickly
you
laugh
at
me
she
asked
not
resentfully
but
with
an
air
of
frank
inquiry
no
at
the
human
race
mademoiselle
it
is
we
not
you
who
excite
laughter
she
regarded
me
with
apparent
curiosity
and
gradually
began
to
smile
why
she
asked
just
showing
her
level
white
teeth
you
have
learned
yet
william
adolphus
began
to
speak
to
her
you
would
have
sworn
she
had
a
deaf
ear
that
side
she
had
finished
her
salad
and
sat
turned
toward
me
if
a
very
white
shoulder
could
at
all
console
my
he
had
an
admirable
view
of
one
apparently
he
was
not
content
he
pushed
his
chair
back
with
a
noise
and
called
to
me
shall
we
smoke
i
have
eaten
enough
with
all
my
heart
i
answered
in
fact
he
has
eaten
too
much
observed
coralie
by
no
means
in
an
aside
he
and
i
we
both
eat
too
much
he
is
fat
already
i
shall
be
you
are
talkative
mademoiselle
said
varvilliers
who
was
offering
her
a
cigarette
i
believe
there
is
some
one
worth
talking
to
she
retorted
alas
and
not
last
night
he
cried
in
affected
despair
i
however
thinking
that
it
would
ill
become
me
to
eat
my
supper
and
then
spoil
his
sport
bowed
to
the
lady
and
crossed
over
to
where
wetter
was
standing
near
him
was
a
group
of
young
men
laughing
and
talking
with
madame
briande
he
seemed
to
pay
little
heed
to
their
chatter
varvilliers
followed
me
and
william
adolphus
sat
down
by
coralie
but
i
had
not
been
talking
to
wetter
more
than
two
minutes
when
the
lady
rose
left
my
and
came
to
join
our
group
she
took
her
stand
close
by
me
half
attracted
and
half
repelled
by
her
young
enough
still
to
be
shy
i
was
much
embarrassed
the
other
men
were
smiling
i
must
except
william
adolphus
and
varvilliers
whispered
to
me
beaux
yeux
de
votre
couronne
coralie
overheard
his
warning
she
was
not
in
the
least
put
out
do
disturb
yourself
she
said
to
varvilliers
the
king
is
not
a
fool
he
does
suppose
that
people
forget
what
he
is
you
judged
him
on
short
acquaintance
said
varvilliers
rather
vexed
it
my
way
and
why
should
i
give
my
opinion
wetter
laughed
and
said
to
the
frenchman
you
had
better
not
ask
for
your
character
i
think
vicomte
heavens
no
cried
he
come
i
see
monseigneur
all
alone
you
are
right
said
coralie
go
and
talk
to
him
the
king
and
i
will
talk
they
went
off
wetter
laughing
varvilliers
still
a
little
ruffled
by
his
encounter
coralie
passed
her
arm
through
mine
and
led
me
to
a
sofa
i
had
recovered
my
composure
was
interested
and
amused
briande
she
said
suddenly
is
always
deploring
my
stupidity
will
you
get
on
she
says
wit
men
are
ruled
by
wit
though
they
are
won
by
faces
so
she
says
well
i
do
know
wit
is
not
in
my
line
she
looked
at
me
half
questioningly
half
defiantly
i
perceive
no
deficiency
in
the
quality
mademoiselle
said
i
then
you
have
not
known
witty
women
she
retorted
tranquilly
but
i
am
not
altogether
dull
i
am
not
like
monseigneur
there
my
so
i
am
told
as
she
said
this
she
looked
again
at
me
and
began
to
laugh
i
laughed
also
but
i
could
not
very
well
discuss
william
adolphus
with
her
what
man
do
you
desire
to
rule
with
this
wit
i
asked
one
ca
tell
when
it
might
be
useful
said
she
with
a
barely
perceptible
smile
surely
beauty
is
more
powerful
with
monseigneur
oh
never
mind
monseigneur
but
not
with
men
of
another
kind
some
men
are
not
to
be
ruled
by
any
means
you
think
so
take
wetter
now
i
would
give
him
a
week
resistance
varvilliers
a
day
i
did
not
put
the
third
question
but
i
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
she
saw
my
meaning
of
course
but
she
did
not
tell
me
how
long
a
resistance
she
would
predict
for
me
i
thought
that
i
had
talked
enough
to
her
and
since
she
would
not
let
me
alone
i
determined
to
take
my
leave
i
wished
her
she
received
my
adieu
with
marked
indifference
i
am
very
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
said
i
why
yes
she
answered
you
are
thinking
that
i
am
a
strange
creature
a
new
experience
and
with
this
she
turned
away
although
i
was
about
to
speak
again
varvilliers
way
lay
in
the
same
direction
as
mine
and
i
took
him
with
me
he
chatted
gaily
as
we
went
what
i
liked
in
the
vicomte
was
his
confident
denial
of
life
alleged
seriousness
he
seemed
much
amused
at
the
situation
which
he
proceeded
to
unfold
to
me
according
to
him
wetter
was
passionately
my
inanely
enamoured
of
coralie
wetter
was
ready
to
ruin
himself
in
purse
and
prospects
for
her
and
would
gladly
marry
her
william
adolphus
would
be
capable
of
defying
his
wife
his
and
public
opinion
but
coralie
he
explained
cared
little
for
either
wetter
could
give
her
nothing
from
william
adolphus
she
had
already
gained
the
advancement
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
secure
for
her
she
wanted
something
new
so
she
made
him
bring
your
majesty
he
ended
laughing
was
my
unwilling
oh
no
he
did
understand
laughed
varvilliers
he
was
proud
to
bring
you
it
rather
awkward
for
me
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
come
ah
sire
when
we
have
enjoyed
ourselves
let
us
not
be
ungrateful
she
amused
you
she
certainly
interested
me
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
more
do
you
want
he
seemed
to
ask
but
i
was
wondering
whether
i
should
be
justified
in
lending
countenance
to
these
distractions
of
william
adolphus
the
frenchman
quick
wit
overtook
my
thoughts
if
you
wish
to
rescue
the
prince
from
danger
sire
he
said
laughing
you
ca
do
better
than
come
often
it
seems
to
me
that
i
in
danger
of
quarrelling
either
with
my
sister
or
with
my
if
i
were
you
i
should
feel
myself
in
a
danger
more
delightful
but
why
not
yourself
equally
vicomte
are
you
in
love
with
her
not
i
he
answered
with
a
laugh
and
a
shake
of
his
head
but
why
not
i
asked
laughing
also
can
you
ask
there
is
but
one
possible
reason
for
a
man
not
being
in
love
with
coralie
mansoni
tell
me
it
vicomte
because
he
has
been
sire
a
good
safeguard
but
of
no
use
to
me
why
no
not
at
present
answered
varvilliers
the
carriage
drew
up
at
his
lodgings
i
was
not
inclined
for
sleep
and
readily
acceded
to
his
request
that
i
should
pay
him
a
visit
having
dismissed
the
carriage
i
was
but
a
little
way
from
my
own
house
i
mounted
the
stairs
and
found
myself
in
a
very
snug
room
he
put
me
in
an
armchair
and
gave
me
a
cigar
we
talked
long
and
intimately
as
the
hours
of
the
night
rolled
on
he
spoke
half
in
reminiscence
half
in
merry
rhapsody
of
the
joys
of
living
the
delight
of
throwing
the
reins
on
the
neck
of
youth
as
i
looked
at
his
trim
figure
his
handsome
face
merry
eyes
and
dashing
air
all
that
he
said
seemed
very
reasonable
and
very
right
there
was
a
good
defence
for
it
at
the
bar
of
tribunal
it
was
honest
too
free
from
cant
affectation
and
pretence
it
was
a
recognition
of
facts
and
enlisted
truth
on
its
side
it
needed
no
arguing
and
he
gave
it
none
the
spirit
that
inspired
also
vindicated
it
i
could
not
help
recalling
the
agonies
and
struggles
which
my
passion
for
the
countess
von
sempach
had
occasioned
me
at
first
i
thought
that
i
would
tell
him
about
this
affair
but
i
found
myself
ashamed
and
i
was
ashamed
because
i
had
resisted
the
passion
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
tell
him
had
i
yielded
but
the
merry
eyes
would
twinkle
in
amusement
at
my
folly
as
i
had
seen
them
twinkle
at
my
stolidity
he
said
something
incidentally
which
led
me
to
fancy
that
he
had
heard
about
the
countess
and
had
received
a
mistaken
impression
of
the
facts
i
did
not
correct
what
appeared
to
be
his
idea
i
neither
confirmed
nor
contradicted
it
i
said
to
myself
that
it
was
nothing
to
me
what
notion
he
had
of
my
conduct
in
reality
i
did
not
desire
him
to
know
the
truth
i
clung
to
the
conviction
that
i
could
justify
what
had
seemed
my
victory
but
i
did
not
feel
as
though
i
could
justify
it
to
him
he
would
laugh
be
a
little
puzzled
and
dismiss
the
matter
as
inexplicable
his
own
creed
was
not
swathed
in
clouds
nor
dim
nor
hard
clearly
to
see
and
picture
it
was
all
very
straightforward
properly
it
was
no
creed
it
was
a
course
of
action
based
on
a
mode
of
feeling
which
neither
demanded
nor
was
patient
of
defence
or
explanation
the
circumstances
of
my
life
were
such
that
never
before
had
i
been
brought
into
contact
with
a
similar
temperament
or
a
similar
practice
when
they
were
thus
suddenly
presented
to
me
they
seemed
endowed
with
a
most
attractive
simplicity
with
a
naturalness
with
what
i
must
call
a
wholesomeness
the
objections
i
felt
to
be
overstrained
unreal
morbid
varvilliers
feet
were
on
firm
ground
on
what
shaking
uncertain
bog
of
mingled
impulses
emotions
fancies
and
delusions
might
not
those
who
blamed
him
be
found
themselves
to
stand
i
am
confident
that
he
spoke
without
premeditation
with
no
desire
to
win
a
proselyte
merely
as
man
to
man
in
unaffected
intimacy
i
think
that
he
was
rather
sorry
for
me
having
detected
a
gloominess
in
my
view
of
life
and
a
tendency
to
moody
and
fretful
introspection
once
or
twice
he
referred
in
passing
jest
to
the
difference
of
national
characteristics
the
german
tendency
to
make
love
by
crying
so
he
put
it
as
contrasted
with
the
laughing
philosophy
of
his
own
country
at
the
end
he
apologized
for
talking
so
much
and
pointed
out
to
me
a
photograph
of
coralie
that
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
more
than
by
letters
and
papers
saying
i
suppose
she
set
me
off
somehow
she
seems
to
me
a
sort
of
embodiment
of
the
thing
it
was
three
when
i
left
him
even
then
i
went
reluctantly
traversing
again
in
my
mind
the
field
that
his
tongue
had
easily
and
lightly
covered
and
reverting
to
the
girl
who
as
he
said
was
a
sort
of
embodiment
of
the
thing
the
phrase
was
definite
enough
for
its
purpose
and
struck
home
with
an
undeniable
truth
he
and
she
were
the
sort
of
people
to
live
in
that
sort
of
world
and
to
stand
as
its
representatives
a
feeling
came
over
me
that
it
was
a
fair
fine
world
where
life
need
not
be
a
struggle
where
a
man
need
not
live
alone
where
he
would
not
be
striving
always
after
what
he
could
never
achieve
waging
always
a
war
in
which
he
should
never
conquer
staking
all
his
joys
against
most
uncertain
shadowy
prizes
which
to
win
would
bring
no
satisfaction
i
cried
out
suddenly
as
i
walked
by
myself
through
the
night
there
no
pleasure
in
my
life
that
protest
summed
up
my
wrongs
there
was
no
pleasure
in
my
life
there
was
everything
else
but
not
that
not
pure
unmixed
simple
pleasure
had
i
no
right
to
some
i
was
very
tired
of
trying
to
fill
my
place
of
subordinating
myself
to
my
position
of
being
always
augustin
the
king
i
was
weary
of
my
own
ideal
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
be
allowed
to
escape
from
it
sometimes
to
be
as
it
were
in
soul
as
well
as
in
body
so
that
what
i
thought
and
did
should
not
be
reckoned
as
the
work
of
the
king
mind
or
the
act
of
the
king
hand
i
envied
intensely
the
lot
and
the
temper
of
my
friend
varvilliers
when
i
reached
the
palace
and
entered
it
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
were
returning
to
a
prison
its
walls
shut
me
off
from
that
free
existence
whose
sweetness
i
had
tasted
and
forbade
me
to
roam
in
the
fields
whither
youth
beckoned
and
curiosity
lured
me
that
joy
could
never
be
mine
my
burden
was
ever
with
me
the
woman
i
had
loved
was
gone
the
girl
i
must
be
made
husband
to
was
soon
to
come
i
was
not
and
could
not
be
as
other
young
men
that
all
this
the
conversation
with
varvilliers
its
effect
on
me
my
restless
discontent
and
angry
protests
against
my
fate
should
follow
on
meeting
coralie
mansoni
at
supper
will
not
seem
strange
to
anybody
who
remembers
her
chapter
xv
the
waits
when
my
years
and
my
mood
are
considered
it
may
appear
that
i
had
enough
to
do
in
keeping
my
own
life
in
the
channel
of
wisdom
and
discretion
so
it
seemed
to
myself
and
i
was
rather
amused
at
being
called
upon
to
exert
a
good
influence
or
even
a
wholesome
authority
over
william
adolphus
it
was
so
short
a
time
since
he
had
been
summoned
to
perform
a
like
office
toward
me
yet
after
breakfast
the
next
day
victoria
came
to
me
dressed
in
a
subdued
style
and
speaking
in
low
tones
she
has
always
possessed
a
dramatic
instinct
she
had
been
it
seemed
unable
to
remain
unconscious
of
the
gossip
afoot
of
her
own
feelings
she
preferred
to
say
nothing
she
repeated
this
observation
several
times
what
she
thought
about
was
the
credit
of
the
family
and
of
the
family
she
took
leave
to
remind
me
i
was
i
think
she
said
by
god
will
the
head
i
could
not
resist
remarking
how
times
had
changed
less
than
a
year
ago
she
had
sent
william
adolphus
sober
staid
panoplied
in
the
armour
of
contented
marriage
to
wrestle
with
my
errant
desires
victoria
flushed
and
became
just
a
little
less
meek
what
the
good
of
going
back
to
that
she
asked
none
it
is
merely
amusing
said
i
the
flush
deepened
will
you
allow
me
to
be
insulted
she
cried
let
us
be
cool
you
yourself
to
thank
for
this
victoria
why
you
pleasanter
to
him
oh
he
i
all
i
ought
to
be
to
him
i
do
know
what
you
are
to
him
you
very
little
with
him
i
suppose
that
these
altercations
assume
much
the
same
character
in
all
families
they
are
necessarily
vulgar
and
the
details
of
them
need
not
be
recalled
for
myself
i
must
confess
that
my
sister
found
me
in
a
perverse
mood
she
on
her
side
was
in
the
unreasonable
temper
of
a
woman
who
expects
fidelity
but
does
not
show
appreciation
i
suggested
this
point
for
her
consideration
well
if
i
do
appreciate
him
whose
fault
was
it
i
married
him
she
cried
i
do
know
whose
fault
is
it
that
i
going
to
marry
elsa
bartenstein
whose
fault
is
anything
whose
fault
is
it
that
coralie
mansoni
is
a
pretty
woman
i
never
seen
her
ah
you
would
think
her
pretty
if
you
had
victoria
looked
at
me
for
a
few
seconds
then
she
suddenly
drew
up
a
low
chair
and
sat
down
at
my
feet
she
turned
her
face
up
toward
mine
and
took
my
hand
well
we
never
really
disliked
one
another
victoria
and
i
mother
so
horrid
about
it
she
said
it
was
an
appeal
to
an
old
alliance
sanctified
by
common
sorrows
endeared
by
stolen
victories
shared
in
fearful
secrecy
she
says
it
my
fault
just
as
you
do
but
you
know
her
way
i
became
conscious
that
what
i
had
said
would
be
in
fact
singularly
hard
to
bear
when
it
fell
from
princess
heinrich
judicial
lips
she
told
me
that
i
had
lost
him
and
that
i
had
only
myself
to
thank
for
it
and
she
said
it
was
perhaps
partly
because
my
complexion
had
lost
its
freshness
victoria
paused
and
then
ended
that
a
lie
you
know
i
seemed
to
be
young
again
we
were
again
laying
our
heads
together
with
intent
to
struggle
against
our
mother
i
cared
not
a
groat
for
william
adolphus
but
it
would
be
pleasant
to
me
to
help
my
sister
to
bring
him
back
to
his
bearings
and
the
more
pleasant
in
view
of
princess
heinrich
belief
that
the
things
could
not
be
done
as
far
as
being
pleasant
to
him
goes
victoria
resumed
i
believe
that
the
creature
pleasant
to
him
either
at
least
he
came
home
in
a
horribly
bad
temper
last
night
and
what
did
you
say
to
him
oh
i
i
told
him
what
i
thought
how
we
all
waste
opportunities
i
reflected
you
ought
to
have
soothed
him
down
he
was
annoyed
last
night
of
course
she
asked
how
i
knew
it
and
in
the
candour
of
revived
alliance
i
told
her
the
story
of
our
evening
i
have
observed
before
on
the
curious
fact
that
women
who
think
nothing
of
their
husbands
are
nevertheless
annoyed
when
other
people
agree
in
their
estimate
victoria
was
very
indignant
with
coralie
for
slighting
william
adolphus
and
showing
a
ready
disposition
to
transfer
her
attentions
to
me
it
only
because
you
king
she
said
but
she
did
not
allow
her
vexation
to
obscure
her
perception
her
frown
gave
place
to
a
smile
as
she
looked
up
saying
it
would
be
rather
fun
if
you
flirted
with
her
i
raised
my
eyebrows
whence
came
this
new
complaisance
toward
my
flirtations
just
enough
i
mean
to
disgust
william
adolphus
she
added
then
as
soon
as
he
given
up
you
could
stop
you
know
everything
would
be
right
then
except
mother
you
mean
why
yes
except
mother
and
she
be
splendidly
wrong
laughed
victoria
nobody
who
studies
himself
honestly
or
observes
his
neighbours
with
attention
will
deny
value
to
an
excuse
because
it
may
be
merely
plausible
after
all
to
wear
even
a
transparent
garment
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
to
go
naked
i
do
not
maintain
that
suggestion
contributed
decisively
to
the
prosecution
of
my
acquaintance
with
coralie
mansoni
but
it
filled
a
gap
in
the
array
of
reasons
and
impulses
which
were
leading
me
on
and
gave
to
the
matter
an
air
of
sport
and
adventure
most
potent
in
attraction
for
such
a
mood
as
mine
i
was
in
rebellion
against
the
limits
of
my
position
and
the
repression
of
my
manner
of
life
to
play
a
prank
like
this
suited
my
humour
exactly
when
victoria
left
me
i
sent
word
of
my
intention
to
be
present
at
coralie
theatre
that
evening
and
invited
william
adolphus
to
join
me
in
my
box
i
received
the
answer
that
he
would
come
when
we
arrived
at
the
theatre
coralie
was
already
on
the
stage
she
was
singing
a
song
she
had
a
very
fine
voice
her
delivery
and
air
empty
of
real
feeling
were
full
nevertheless
of
a
sensuous
attraction
my
laid
his
elbows
on
the
front
of
the
box
and
stared
down
at
her
i
sat
a
little
back
and
after
watching
the
scene
for
a
few
moments
began
to
look
at
the
house
immediately
opposite
me
i
saw
varvilliers
with
a
party
of
ladies
and
men
he
bowed
and
smiled
as
i
caught
his
eye
in
another
box
i
saw
wetter
gazing
at
the
singer
as
intently
as
william
adolphus
himself
there
must
certainly
be
something
in
a
girl
who
exercised
power
over
two
men
so
different
and
wetter
was
a
person
of
importance
and
prominence
accepted
as
a
political
leader
and
consequently
a
fine
target
for
gossip
his
feelings
must
be
strongly
engaged
before
he
exposed
himself
to
comment
i
fell
to
studying
his
face
he
was
pale
when
i
took
my
glass
i
could
see
the
nervous
frown
on
his
brow
and
the
restless
gleam
of
his
eyes
by
my
side
william
adolphus
was
chuckling
with
bovine
satisfaction
at
an
allusion
in
coralie
song
his
last
night
pique
seemed
forgotten
i
leaned
forward
and
looked
again
at
coralie
she
saw
me
and
sang
the
next
verse
straight
at
me
she
did
the
same
thing
once
more
in
later
days
i
saw
people
heads
turn
toward
my
box
and
drew
back
behind
the
shelter
of
the
hangings
at
the
end
of
the
act
my
turned
to
me
blew
his
nose
and
ejaculated
superb
i
nodded
my
head
splendid
said
he
i
nodded
again
he
launched
on
a
catalogue
of
coralie
attractions
but
seemed
to
check
himself
rather
suddenly
i
do
suppose
she
your
sort
though
he
remarked
why
not
i
asked
with
a
smile
oh
i
do
know
you
like
clever
women
who
can
talk
and
so
on
bore
you
to
death
in
an
hour
augustin
would
she
said
i
innocently
i
was
amused
at
william
adolphus
simple
cunning
i
daresay
i
should
bore
her
too
perhaps
you
would
he
chuckled
only
she
would
tell
you
so
of
course
but
wetter
does
seem
to
bore
her
i
observed
good
god
does
he
cried
my
there
were
limits
to
the
amusement
to
be
got
out
of
him
i
yawned
and
looked
across
the
house
again
wetter
place
was
empty
i
drew
william
adolphus
attention
to
the
fact
i
wonder
if
the
fellow
gone
behind
he
said
uneasily
we
go
after
the
next
act
you
go
of
course
i
shall
send
and
ask
permission
william
adolphus
looked
puzzled
and
gloomy
i
did
know
you
cared
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
mean
the
theatre
and
all
that
we
have
a
coralie
mansoni
here
every
day
i
reminded
him
i
care
for
the
ordinary
run
but
she
something
remarkable
is
she
he
muttered
a
few
words
and
turned
away
a
moment
later
varvilliers
knocked
at
the
door
of
my
box
and
entered
here
was
a
good
messenger
for
me
i
sent
him
to
ask
whether
coralie
would
receive
me
after
the
next
act
he
went
off
on
his
errand
laughing
i
need
not
record
the
various
stages
and
the
gradual
progress
of
my
acquaintance
with
coralie
mansoni
it
would
be
for
the
most
part
a
narrative
of
foolish
actions
and
a
repetition
of
trivial
conversations
i
have
shown
how
i
came
to
enter
on
it
led
by
a
spirit
of
rebellion
and
the
love
of
a
joke
weary
of
the
repression
that
was
partly
inevitable
partly
glad
to
find
an
outlet
for
my
youthful
impulses
in
a
direction
where
my
action
would
involve
no
political
danger
on
one
good
result
i
can
pride
myself
i
was
undoubtedly
the
instrument
of
sending
my
back
to
his
wife
a
humbled
and
repentant
man
coralie
had
no
scruple
about
allowing
him
to
perceive
that
her
attentions
had
been
paid
to
his
rank
not
to
himself
and
his
rank
was
now
eclipsed
a
few
days
of
sulking
was
followed
by
a
violent
outburst
but
my
position
was
too
strong
he
could
not
quarrel
seriously
with
his
wife
brother
on
such
a
ground
he
returned
to
victoria
and
i
had
no
doubt
received
the
castigation
which
he
certainly
deserved
my
interest
in
him
vanished
as
he
vanished
from
the
society
that
centred
round
mlle
mansoni
at
the
same
time
my
share
in
his
defeat
and
humiliation
left
a
soreness
between
us
which
lasted
for
a
long
while
i
myself
had
by
this
time
fallen
into
a
severe
conflict
of
feeling
my
temperament
was
not
like
varvilliers
for
an
hour
or
two
when
i
was
exhilarated
with
society
and
cheered
by
wine
i
could
seem
to
myself
such
as
he
naturally
and
permanently
was
but
i
was
not
a
native
of
the
clime
i
raised
myself
to
those
heights
of
unmoral
serenity
by
an
effort
and
an
artifice
he
forgot
himself
easily
i
was
always
examining
myself
that
same
motive
or
instinct
or
tradition
of
feeling
i
do
not
know
how
best
to
describe
it
on
whose
altar
i
had
sacrificed
my
first
passion
was
still
strong
in
me
i
did
not
fear
that
coralie
would
or
could
exercise
a
political
influence
over
me
but
i
was
loth
that
she
should
possess
a
control
of
any
sort
i
clung
obstinately
to
the
conception
of
myself
as
standing
alone
as
being
independent
and
under
the
power
of
nobody
in
any
respect
this
was
to
me
a
stronger
check
than
the
restraint
of
accepted
morality
looking
back
on
the
matter
and
judging
myself
as
i
should
judge
any
young
man
i
am
confident
that
my
passion
would
easily
have
swept
away
the
ordinary
scruples
it
was
my
other
conscience
my
king
conscience
that
raised
the
barrier
and
protracted
the
resistance
here
is
another
case
of
that
reaction
of
my
position
on
myself
which
has
been
such
a
feature
of
my
life
varvilliers
unreasoned
philosophy
did
not
cover
this
point
here
i
had
to
fight
out
the
question
for
myself
it
was
again
a
struggle
between
the
man
and
the
king
between
a
natural
impulse
and
the
strength
of
an
intellectual
conception
i
perceived
with
mingled
amusement
and
bitterness
how
entirely
varvilliers
failed
to
appreciate
the
condition
of
my
mind
or
to
conceal
his
surprise
at
my
alternate
hot
and
cold
fits
urgency
followed
by
a
eagerness
to
be
moving
at
moments
when
nothing
could
be
done
succeeded
by
refusals
to
stir
when
the
road
was
clear
i
believe
that
he
came
to
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
as
a
man
of
the
world
but
his
kindness
toward
me
never
varied
but
there
was
one
to
whom
my
mind
was
an
open
book
who
read
easily
and
plainly
every
thought
of
it
because
it
was
written
in
the
same
characters
as
was
his
own
the
politician
who
risked
his
future
the
debtor
who
every
day
incurred
new
expenses
the
devotee
of
principles
who
sacrificed
them
for
his
passion
the
deviser
of
schemes
who
ruined
them
at
the
demand
of
his
desires
here
was
the
man
who
could
understand
the
heart
of
his
king
wetter
was
my
sympathizer
and
wetter
was
my
rival
the
relations
between
us
in
those
days
were
strange
we
did
not
quarrel
we
felt
a
friendliness
for
one
another
each
knew
the
price
the
other
paid
or
must
pay
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own
price
but
we
were
rivals
varvilliers
was
wrong
when
he
said
that
coralie
cared
nothing
about
wetter
she
cared
although
it
was
in
a
peculiar
fashion
that
she
cared
truly
he
could
give
her
little
but
he
was
to
her
a
sign
and
a
testimony
of
her
power
even
as
i
myself
in
another
way
mine
was
the
high
rank
the
great
position
in
conquering
me
lay
the
open
and
notorious
triumph
but
she
was
not
insensible
to
the
more
private
joy
and
secret
exultation
that
came
to
her
from
dominating
a
ruling
mind
and
filling
with
her
own
image
a
head
capacious
enough
to
hold
imperial
policies
and
shape
the
destinies
of
kingdoms
wetter
and
i
each
in
our
way
broke
through
the
crust
of
seemingly
consistent
frivolity
that
was
on
her
and
down
to
a
tendency
toward
romance
and
the
love
of
power
she
could
not
rule
directly
but
she
could
rule
rulers
i
am
certain
that
some
such
idea
was
in
her
head
alloying
or
at
least
refining
a
grosser
therefore
wetter
no
less
than
i
was
of
value
to
her
she
would
not
willingly
have
let
him
go
even
although
he
could
give
her
nothing
and
she
did
not
care
for
him
in
the
only
sense
of
which
my
friend
the
vicomte
took
account
i
came
to
realize
how
it
was
between
her
and
him
before
very
long
and
to
see
how
the
same
ultimate
instinct
of
her
nature
made
her
long
to
gather
both
him
and
me
into
her
net
thus
she
would
have
bowing
before
her
the
highest
and
the
strongest
heads
in
forstadt
that
she
so
analyzed
and
reasoned
out
her
wishes
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
but
we
he
and
i
performed
the
task
for
her
each
knew
that
the
other
was
at
work
on
it
each
chafed
that
she
would
consent
to
be
but
half
his
each
desired
to
rule
alone
not
to
be
one
of
two
that
were
ruled
all
this
had
been
dimly
foreshadowed
to
me
when
i
sat
in
the
theatre
looking
now
at
coralie
as
she
sang
her
song
now
at
wetter
frowning
brows
and
lips
i
must
add
that
my
position
was
rendered
peculiarly
difficult
by
the
fact
that
wetter
not
only
owed
me
deference
but
was
still
in
my
debt
for
the
money
i
had
lent
him
he
had
refused
to
consider
it
a
gift
but
was
and
became
every
day
more
incapable
of
repaying
it
we
were
at
luncheon
at
her
villa
one
day
we
three
and
with
us
of
course
madame
briande
an
exceedingly
and
tactful
little
woman
coralie
had
been
very
silent
and
as
usual
attentive
to
her
meal
the
rest
had
chattered
on
many
subjects
suddenly
she
spoke
it
has
been
very
amusing
she
said
with
a
little
yawn
that
ended
in
a
rather
weary
smile
for
my
part
i
can
conceive
only
one
thing
that
could
increase
the
entertainment
what
that
coralie
asked
madame
briande
coralie
waved
her
right
hand
toward
me
and
her
left
toward
wetter
why
that
we
should
have
for
audience
and
as
spectators
of
our
little
feast
your
subjects
sire
and
monsieur
your
followers
clearly
coralie
had
been
maturing
this
rather
startling
speech
for
some
time
she
launched
it
with
an
evident
enjoyment
of
its
malice
a
moment
of
astonished
silence
followed
madame
tact
was
strained
beyond
its
uttermost
resources
she
smiled
nervously
and
said
nothing
wetter
turned
red
i
looked
full
in
coralie
eyes
drained
my
glass
of
cognac
and
laughed
but
why
should
that
be
amusing
i
asked
and
at
least
shall
we
not
add
to
our
imaginary
audience
the
crowd
of
your
admirers
as
you
will
said
she
with
a
shrug
whomever
we
add
they
would
see
nothing
but
two
gentlemen
getting
under
the
table
oh
so
quickly
madame
briande
became
visibly
distressed
is
it
not
so
drawled
coralie
in
lazy
enjoyment
of
her
excursion
why
said
i
i
should
most
certainly
invoke
the
shelter
of
your
tablecloth
mademoiselle
a
king
must
avoid
being
misunderstood
i
thought
so
said
she
with
a
long
look
at
me
and
you
monsieur
she
added
turning
to
wetter
i
should
not
get
under
the
table
said
he
he
strove
to
render
his
tone
light
but
his
voice
quivered
with
suppressed
passion
you
would
she
asked
you
sit
here
before
them
all
yes
said
he
madame
briande
rose
her
evident
intention
was
to
break
up
the
party
coralie
took
no
notice
we
men
sat
on
opposite
one
another
with
her
between
us
on
the
third
side
of
the
small
square
table
must
not
a
politician
avoid
being
misunderstood
she
asked
wetter
unless
there
is
something
else
that
he
values
more
was
the
reply
she
turned
to
me
smiling
still
would
not
that
be
so
with
a
king
also
certainly
if
there
could
be
such
a
thing
but
you
think
there
could
not
i
ca
call
such
a
thing
to
mind
mademoiselle
ah
you
ca
call
it
to
mind
no
you
ca
call
it
to
mind
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
difference
then
between
politicians
and
kings
madame
briande
was
moving
about
the
room
in
evident
discomfort
wetter
was
sitting
with
his
hand
clenched
on
the
table
and
his
eyes
downcast
coralie
looked
long
and
intently
at
him
then
she
turned
her
eyes
on
me
i
took
out
a
cigarette
lit
it
and
smiled
at
her
you
you
would
get
under
the
table
she
asked
me
you
catch
my
meaning
perfectly
then
are
you
ashamed
to
sit
at
it
yes
said
i
and
laughed
ah
she
cried
shaking
her
fist
at
me
and
herself
laughing
then
she
leaned
over
toward
me
and
whispered
you
shall
retract
that
wetter
looked
up
and
saw
her
whispering
to
me
and
laughing
as
she
whispered
he
frowned
and
i
saw
his
hand
tremble
on
the
table
though
i
laughed
and
fenced
with
her
and
defied
her
i
was
myself
in
some
excitement
i
seemed
to
be
playing
a
match
and
i
had
confidence
in
my
game
wetter
spoke
abruptly
in
a
harsh
but
carefully
restrained
voice
it
is
not
for
me
to
question
the
king
account
of
himself
he
said
but
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
your
question
did
me
a
wrong
openly
i
come
here
openly
i
leave
here
all
know
why
i
come
and
what
i
desire
in
coming
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
declare
it
before
all
the
city
she
rose
and
made
him
a
curtsey
then
she
gave
a
slight
yawn
and
observed
so
now
we
know
just
where
we
are
the
king
has
defined
his
position
with
great
accuracy
said
wetter
with
an
open
sneer
yes
what
is
it
she
asked
his
own
words
are
enough
mine
could
add
no
clearness
and
might
give
offence
she
asked
it
is
possible
said
he
then
we
come
to
this
which
is
better
a
king
under
the
table
or
a
politician
at
it
she
burst
out
laughing
madame
briande
had
fled
to
a
remote
corner
wetter
was
in
the
throes
of
excitement
a
strange
coolness
and
recklessness
now
possessed
me
i
was
insensible
of
everything
at
this
moment
except
the
impulse
of
rivalry
and
the
desire
for
victory
nothing
in
the
scene
had
power
to
repel
me
my
eyes
were
blind
to
everything
of
ugly
aspect
in
it
to
define
the
question
mademoiselle
should
be
but
a
preliminary
to
answering
it
said
i
with
a
bow
i
would
answer
it
this
minute
sire
but
you
hesitate
perhaps
oh
no
but
my
is
waiting
for
me
let
no
such
trifle
detain
you
then
i
cried
for
i
even
i
the
coward
had
sooner
be
misunderstood
why
precisely
i
had
sooner
be
misunderstood
than
that
your
hair
should
not
be
perfectly
dressed
at
the
theatre
wetter
rose
to
his
feet
he
said
to
coralie
not
a
word
more
to
me
he
bowed
very
low
and
very
formally
i
returned
his
salutation
with
a
cool
nod
as
he
turned
to
the
door
coralie
cried
i
shall
see
you
at
supper
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
her
i
do
know
he
said
very
well
i
like
uncertainty
we
will
hope
he
went
out
i
stood
facing
her
for
a
moment
well
said
she
looking
in
my
eyes
and
seeming
to
challenge
an
expression
of
opinion
you
are
pleased
with
yourself
yes
you
have
done
some
mischief
how
much
i
do
know
but
you
love
uncertainty
true
true
and
you
seem
to
think
that
i
love
candour
do
you
i
think
that
i
love
everything
and
everybody
in
the
world
except
you
i
laughed
again
i
knew
that
i
had
triumphed
behold
your
decision
i
cried
and
the
still
waits
she
did
not
answer
me
she
stood
there
smiling
i
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
with
much
and
even
affected
gallantry
then
i
went
and
paid
a
like
attention
to
madame
briande
as
the
little
woman
made
her
curtsey
she
turned
alarmed
and
troubled
eyes
up
to
me
oh
she
murmured
till
smiled
coralie
chapter
xvi
a
chase
of
two
phantoms
i
was
reading
the
other
day
the
memoirs
of
an
eminent
english
man
of
letters
now
dead
he
had
paid
a
long
visit
to
forstadt
and
had
much
to
say
sometimes
i
think
in
a
vein
of
veiled
irony
about
victoria
her
literary
tastes
and
her
literary
circle
finding
amusement
enough
to
induce
me
to
turn
over
a
few
more
pages
i
came
on
the
following
passage
with
the
king
himself
i
conversed
once
only
but
i
saw
him
often
and
heard
much
about
him
he
was
then
a
tall
and
very
thin
young
man
with
dark
brown
hair
and
a
small
mustache
of
a
lighter
tint
his
nose
was
aquiline
his
eyes
rather
deep
set
his
face
long
and
inclining
to
the
he
had
beautiful
hands
of
which
he
was
said
to
be
proud
he
stooped
a
little
when
walking
but
displayed
considerable
dignity
of
carriage
he
was
accused
of
haughtiness
except
toward
a
few
intimates
unquestionably
his
late
adviser
hammerfeldt
had
imbued
him
with
some
notions
as
to
his
position
which
it
is
hardly
unjust
to
call
medi√¶val
a
wit
or
wit
said
of
him
that
he
postulated
god
in
order
to
legitimize
the
powers
of
augustin
his
deputy
certain
persons
very
closely
acquainted
with
him
i
withhold
names
gave
a
curious
account
of
his
character
usually
he
was
reserved
and
even
secretive
cautious
cold
and
free
from
enthusiasms
and
follies
alike
but
at
times
he
appeared
to
be
taken
with
moods
of
strong
feeling
then
he
would
speak
freely
to
the
first
person
who
might
be
by
was
eager
for
merriment
and
dissipation
not
fastidious
as
to
how
he
came
by
what
he
wanted
seeming
forgetful
of
the
sterner
rule
by
which
his
daily
life
was
governed
a
reaction
would
generally
follow
and
the
king
would
appear
to
take
a
revenge
on
himself
by
acid
and
savagely
humorous
comments
on
his
own
acts
and
on
the
companions
of
his
hours
of
relaxation
so
far
as
i
studied
him
for
myself
i
was
led
to
conclude
that
he
possessed
a
very
impressionable
and
passionate
temperament
but
contrived
in
general
to
keep
it
in
repression
there
were
one
or
two
scandals
related
about
him
but
when
we
consider
his
position
and
temptations
we
must
give
credit
either
to
his
virtues
or
to
his
discretion
that
such
stories
were
not
more
numerous
i
liked
him
and
thought
well
of
him
but
i
do
think
that
he
enjoyed
a
disposition
likely
to
result
in
a
happy
life
for
himself
he
was
said
to
have
great
attractions
for
women
but
i
am
not
aware
that
he
admitted
persons
of
either
sex
to
his
confidence
or
friendship
he
was
i
imagine
jealous
of
even
appearing
to
be
under
any
influence
this
impression
of
me
was
written
just
about
the
time
of
my
acquaintance
with
coralie
mansoni
and
of
the
events
which
led
to
a
sudden
break
in
it
the
judgment
of
me
seems
very
fair
and
marked
by
considerable
acumen
i
have
quoted
it
because
it
may
serve
in
some
degree
to
explain
my
conduct
at
the
time
it
also
appears
to
have
an
interest
of
its
own
as
an
independent
appreciation
formed
by
a
and
competent
observer
i
wish
that
the
same
hand
had
painted
an
adequate
portrait
of
wetter
for
his
character
better
deserved
study
than
my
own
but
with
the
curious
prejudice
against
politicians
that
so
often
affects
the
minds
of
students
and
men
of
letters
those
hermits
of
the
writer
dismisses
wetter
briefly
and
almost
contemptuously
as
an
able
but
unscrupulous
politician
addicted
to
extravagances
and
irregularity
in
private
life
he
gives
more
space
to
william
adolphus
than
to
wetter
so
difficult
it
is
even
for
superior
minds
to
remain
altogether
unaffected
by
the
lustre
of
rank
the
old
truism
could
not
be
better
exhibited
i
kept
my
appointment
and
went
again
to
coralie
in
the
evening
i
took
with
me
vohrenlorf
my
brother
to
the
general
my
former
governor
there
had
been
a
dinner
at
the
palace
and
we
were
both
in
uniform
i
had
hardly
expected
wetter
to
come
that
evening
but
he
was
already
there
when
i
arrived
he
seemed
in
an
excited
state
i
found
afterward
that
he
was
fresh
from
the
delivery
of
a
singularly
brilliant
and
violent
speech
in
the
chamber
i
saluted
him
with
intentional
and
marked
politeness
he
made
no
more
response
than
purest
formality
demanded
i
was
aggrieved
at
this
for
i
desired
to
be
friendly
with
him
in
spite
of
our
rather
absurd
rivalry
turning
away
from
him
i
sat
down
by
coralie
and
asked
her
if
supper
were
ready
we
waiting
for
varvilliers
she
answered
but
where
is
madame
briande
she
went
upstairs
i
wanted
a
word
with
wetter
she
be
down
directly
a
word
with
wetter
why
not
sire
she
asked
with
aggressive
innocence
there
can
be
no
reason
why
not
mademoiselle
i
replied
smiling
we
were
interrupted
by
varvilliers
arrival
he
also
had
dined
at
the
palace
and
was
in
full
dress
how
gay
my
little
house
is
drawled
coralie
as
she
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
in
exactly
the
same
manner
the
descent
of
madame
briande
and
the
ascent
of
supper
both
orders
were
promptly
obeyed
and
we
were
left
alone
servants
were
never
allowed
to
remain
in
waiting
on
these
occasions
varvilliers
was
in
fine
vein
that
night
and
wetter
seconded
him
the
one
glittered
with
gems
of
speech
the
other
struck
chords
of
deep
and
touching
music
i
played
a
more
modest
part
madame
and
vohrenlorf
were
audience
coralie
seemed
the
judge
whose
hand
was
to
award
the
prize
yet
she
was
indolent
and
appeared
to
listen
to
no
more
than
half
of
what
was
said
we
finished
eating
and
began
to
smoke
the
wine
still
went
round
suddenly
a
pause
fell
on
us
a
from
varvilliers
had
set
to
our
subject
and
another
delayed
presenting
itself
to
my
surprise
wetter
turned
to
me
in
the
chamber
sire
he
said
there
was
a
question
about
your
marriage
i
perceived
at
once
the
malice
which
inspired
his
remark
but
i
answered
him
gaily
and
in
a
tone
that
was
in
harmony
with
the
scene
i
wish
to
heaven
said
i
there
were
a
question
about
it
anywhere
else
alas
it
is
a
certainty
why
so
is
death
sire
cried
varvilliers
but
we
do
not
discuss
it
at
supper
does
de
varvilliers
quarrel
with
my
choice
of
a
subject
asked
wetters
he
spoke
calmly
now
but
it
was
not
hard
to
discern
his
great
excitement
i
quarrel
sir
with
nobody
except
quarrellers
answered
the
frenchman
impatiently
well
then
began
wetter
i
think
you
forget
my
presence
i
said
coldly
and
this
lady
also
i
waved
my
hand
toward
coralie
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
smiling
and
holding
an
unlighted
cigarette
between
her
fingers
i
forget
sire
neither
your
presence
nor
your
due
said
wetter
with
that
he
took
a
from
his
pocket
and
flung
it
on
the
table
before
me
there
is
my
debt
he
said
i
sat
back
in
my
chair
and
did
not
move
you
choose
a
strange
time
for
business
i
observed
vohrenlorf
see
what
is
in
this
vohrenlorf
examined
it
then
he
came
and
whispered
in
my
ear
notes
for
marks
it
was
the
amount
wetter
owed
me
with
accrued
interest
i
was
amazed
he
could
not
have
raised
the
money
except
at
a
most
extravagant
rate
i
made
no
remark
but
i
knew
that
he
had
risked
ruin
by
this
repayment
and
i
knew
well
why
he
had
made
it
he
would
not
have
me
for
creditor
as
well
as
for
king
and
rival
varvilliers
burst
out
laughing
upon
my
word
said
he
these
gentlemen
of
the
chamber
can
think
of
nothing
but
money
do
you
wonder
at
them
mademoiselle
money
is
good
to
think
of
said
coralie
reflectively
an
admirable
candour
is
it
sire
he
said
turning
to
me
and
pointing
to
coralie
i
was
disturbed
and
out
of
humour
again
i
was
in
conflict
i
thought
of
what
she
was
and
wondered
that
such
men
and
men
so
placed
as
wetter
and
i
should
quarrel
about
her
i
looked
in
her
face
and
felt
a
momentary
conviction
that
all
the
world
might
fall
to
fighting
on
her
account
at
least
things
more
absurd
have
surely
happened
but
i
answered
smoothly
and
composedly
that
trick
at
least
i
had
learned
sincerity
is
our
hostess
greatest
charm
said
wetter
laughed
loudly
and
sneeringly
coralie
turned
a
gaze
of
indifferent
curiosity
on
him
he
puzzled
her
tiresomely
sometimes
i
knew
that
he
meant
an
insult
my
blood
runs
hot
at
such
moments
i
was
about
to
speak
when
varvilliers
forestalled
me
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
said
in
a
very
low
voice
to
wetter
sir
his
majesty
is
the
only
gentleman
in
forstadt
who
can
not
resent
an
insult
i
recollect
well
little
madame
briande
pale
face
as
she
half
rose
from
her
seat
with
clasped
hands
coralie
still
smiled
vohrenlorf
was
red
and
fierce
with
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
varvilliers
was
calm
cool
polished
in
demeanour
for
a
moment
or
two
wetter
sat
silent
his
eyes
intently
fixed
on
the
vicomte
face
then
he
said
in
a
tone
as
low
as
varvilliers
had
been
i
think
his
majesty
remembers
his
disabilities
too
late
or
has
them
remembered
for
him
vohrenlorf
rose
to
his
feet
carried
away
by
anger
and
excitement
sir
he
cried
loudly
vohrenlorf
be
quiet
sit
down
said
i
wetter
is
right
none
spoke
even
coralie
seemed
affected
to
gravity
or
was
it
that
we
had
touched
the
spring
of
her
dramatic
instinct
after
a
few
minutes
i
turned
to
madame
briande
and
introduced
some
indifferent
topic
i
spoke
alone
and
found
no
answer
coralie
was
now
regarding
me
with
obvious
curiosity
the
air
of
this
room
is
hot
said
i
should
we
be
better
in
the
other
if
the
ladies
will
lead
the
way
we
follow
immediately
i
very
well
here
said
coralie
oblige
me
said
i
rising
and
myself
opening
the
door
that
led
to
the
inner
room
after
a
moment
hesitation
coralie
passed
out
and
madame
followed
her
i
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
turning
faced
the
three
men
wetter
stood
alone
by
the
mantelpiece
the
others
were
still
near
the
table
in
everything
but
the
moment
of
his
remark
wetter
was
right
said
i
i
did
remember
in
time
that
i
am
not
placed
as
other
men
i
will
not
remember
it
now
varvilliers
you
must
be
concerned
in
this
vohrenlorf
i
put
myself
in
your
hands
good
god
you
wo
fight
cried
varvilliers
vohrenlorf
will
do
for
me
what
he
would
for
any
gentleman
who
put
himself
in
his
hands
said
i
the
position
was
too
hard
for
young
vohrenlorf
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
no
no
i
ca
he
muttered
wetter
stood
still
as
a
rock
looking
not
at
any
of
us
but
down
toward
the
floor
varvilliers
drank
a
glass
of
wine
and
then
wiped
his
mustache
carefully
with
a
napkin
your
majesty
said
he
will
not
do
me
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
i
am
not
in
everything
and
most
readily
at
your
command
but
i
would
beg
the
honour
of
representing
your
majesty
in
this
affair
impossible
said
i
briefly
consider
sire
to
fight
you
is
ruin
to
m
wetter
as
regards
that
would
not
wetter
in
his
turn
reflect
too
late
i
asked
stiffly
vohrenlorf
looked
up
with
a
hopeless
dazed
expression
varvilliers
was
at
a
loss
wetter
figure
and
face
were
still
unmoved
a
sudden
idea
came
into
my
head
there
is
no
need
for
wetter
to
be
ruined
said
i
whatever
the
result
may
be
it
shall
seem
an
accident
wetter
looked
up
with
a
quick
jerk
of
his
head
i
glanced
at
the
clock
in
four
hours
it
will
be
light
i
said
let
us
meet
at
six
in
the
garden
pavilion
at
the
palace
varvilliers
since
you
desire
to
assist
us
i
have
no
doubt
wetter
will
accept
your
services
it
will
be
well
to
have
no
more
present
than
necessary
the
pavilion
gentlemen
i
need
hardly
remind
you
is
fitted
up
for
revolver
practice
well
there
are
targets
at
each
end
it
will
be
unfortunate
but
not
strange
if
one
of
us
steps
carelessly
into
the
line
of
fire
they
understood
my
idea
but
varvilliers
had
an
objection
what
if
both
of
you
he
asked
lifting
his
brows
that
so
unlikely
said
i
come
shall
it
be
so
wetter
looked
me
full
in
the
face
and
bowed
low
i
am
at
his
majesty
orders
said
he
he
spoke
now
quite
calmly
varvilliers
and
vohrenlorf
seemed
to
regard
him
with
a
sort
of
wonder
at
the
risk
of
ridicule
i
must
confess
to
something
of
the
same
feeling
a
bullet
is
no
respecter
of
persons
and
has
no
sympathy
with
ideas
which
as
the
englishman
observes
it
is
hardly
unjust
to
call
medi√¶val
yes
even
i
myself
was
a
little
surprised
that
wetter
should
meet
me
in
a
duel
but
while
i
was
surprised
i
was
glad
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
wetter
i
said
returning
his
bow
in
that
he
does
not
insist
on
my
disabilities
for
the
briefest
moment
he
smiled
at
me
i
think
my
speech
touched
his
humour
then
he
grew
grave
again
and
thanked
varvilliers
formally
for
the
offer
of
his
services
there
remains
but
one
thing
said
i
we
must
assure
the
ladies
that
any
difference
of
opinion
there
was
between
us
is
entirely
past
let
us
join
them
vohrenlorf
opened
the
door
of
the
inner
room
and
i
entered
the
rest
following
madame
briande
sat
in
a
chair
at
the
table
she
had
a
book
before
her
but
her
restless
anxious
air
made
me
doubt
whether
she
had
read
much
of
it
i
looked
round
for
coralie
there
on
the
sofa
she
lay
her
head
resting
luxuriously
on
the
cushions
and
her
bosom
rising
and
falling
in
gentle
regular
breathing
the
affair
had
not
been
interesting
enough
to
keep
coralie
awake
but
now
vohrenlorf
shut
the
door
rather
noisily
she
opened
her
eyes
stretched
her
arms
and
yawned
ah
you
done
quarrelling
she
asked
absolutely
we
all
friends
again
and
have
come
to
say
farewell
well
i
very
sleepy
said
she
with
much
resignation
go
and
sleep
well
my
friends
we
forgiven
for
our
bad
manners
oh
but
you
were
very
amusing
you
all
going
home
now
so
we
propose
mademoiselle
her
eyes
chanced
to
fall
on
wetter
she
pointed
her
finger
at
him
and
began
to
laugh
what
makes
you
as
pale
as
a
ghost
my
friend
she
asked
it
late
i
tired
he
answered
lamely
and
awkwardly
she
turned
a
shrewd
glance
on
me
i
smiled
composedly
ah
well
it
no
affair
of
mine
she
said
in
turn
we
took
farewell
of
her
and
of
madame
but
as
i
was
going
out
she
called
me
in
a
minute
vohrenlorf
i
cried
waving
my
hand
toward
the
door
the
rest
passed
out
madame
had
wandered
restlessly
to
the
fireplace
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
i
returned
to
coralie
sofa
you
going
too
she
asked
certainly
said
i
i
must
rest
i
have
to
rise
early
and
it
close
on
two
you
do
look
sleepy
i
depart
from
duty
not
from
inclination
you
come
to
see
me
if
i
possibly
can
could
you
doubt
it
and
why
might
you
possibly
not
be
able
i
am
a
man
of
many
occupations
yes
quarrelling
with
wetter
is
one
indeed
that
all
over
i
not
sure
i
believe
you
you
reduce
me
to
despair
how
can
i
convince
you
madame
briande
walked
suddenly
to
the
door
and
went
out
i
heard
her
invite
vohrenlorf
to
take
a
glass
of
cognac
and
his
ready
acceptance
coralie
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
now
looking
at
me
curiously
i
have
liked
you
very
much
she
said
slowly
you
are
a
good
fellow
a
good
friend
i
do
know
how
it
is
i
feel
uncomfortable
will
you
draw
back
a
curtain
and
open
a
window
it
hot
i
obeyed
her
the
cool
night
air
rushed
in
on
us
fresh
and
delicious
she
drew
her
legs
up
sideways
on
the
sofa
clasping
her
ankles
with
her
hand
do
you
know
she
cried
impatiently
how
sometimes
one
is
uncomfortable
and
does
know
why
it
seems
as
though
something
was
going
to
happen
one
money
to
be
lost
or
one
friends
to
die
or
go
away
that
somehow
they
had
misfortunes
preparing
for
one
i
know
the
feeling
well
enough
but
i
sure
you
need
have
it
oh
i
do
know
it
does
come
without
a
reason
you
no
superstitions
i
suppose
i
have
many
as
a
child
i
learned
them
all
they
never
wrong
yes
something
is
to
happen
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
laughed
you
come
she
asked
with
increased
and
most
unusual
urgency
if
possible
i
answered
again
but
why
wo
you
promise
why
do
you
always
say
possible
tiresome
with
your
possible
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
petulantly
i
might
be
yes
and
you
might
be
dead
but
she
had
begun
petulantly
and
impatiently
as
though
she
were
angry
at
my
excuse
and
meant
to
exhibit
its
absurdity
but
now
she
stopped
suddenly
in
the
pause
the
wind
moaned
i
hate
that
sound
she
cried
resentfully
it
comes
from
the
souls
of
the
dead
as
they
fly
through
the
air
they
fly
round
and
round
the
houses
crying
to
those
who
must
join
them
soon
ah
well
these
people
were
doubtless
often
wrong
when
they
were
alive
why
must
they
be
always
right
when
they
dead
no
death
is
near
i
wish
you
would
stay
with
me
here
talking
and
forgetting
it
night
i
would
make
you
coffee
and
sing
to
you
we
would
shut
the
window
and
light
all
the
lights
and
pretend
it
was
day
i
ca
stay
i
said
i
must
get
back
i
have
business
early
it
is
difficult
to
be
in
contact
with
such
a
mood
as
hers
was
that
night
and
not
catch
something
of
its
infection
reason
protests
but
imagination
falls
a
ready
prey
i
had
no
fear
but
a
sombre
apprehension
of
evil
settled
on
me
i
seemed
to
know
that
our
season
of
thoughtless
reckless
merriment
was
done
and
i
mourned
for
it
there
came
over
me
a
sorrow
for
her
but
i
made
no
attempt
to
express
what
she
certainly
would
not
have
understood
to
feel
for
others
what
they
do
not
feel
for
themselves
is
a
distortion
of
sympathy
which
often
afflicts
me
her
discomfort
was
purely
childish
a
sudden
fear
of
the
dark
night
the
dark
world
the
ways
of
fortune
so
dark
and
unknowable
no
and
no
sting
of
conscience
had
any
part
in
it
she
had
been
happy
and
she
wanted
to
go
on
being
happy
but
now
she
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
be
unhappy
and
she
shrank
from
unhappiness
as
from
a
toothache
i
took
her
hand
and
kissed
and
caressed
it
go
to
bed
my
dear
said
i
you
be
laughing
at
this
in
the
morning
and
poor
vohrenlorf
is
waiting
all
this
while
for
me
go
then
you
may
kiss
me
though
i
bent
down
and
kissed
her
your
lips
are
very
hot
she
said
yet
you
look
cool
enough
i
am
even
rather
cold
i
must
walk
home
briskly
you
make
it
up
with
poor
wetter
indeed
our
difference
is
over
or
all
but
over
good
i
hate
my
friends
to
quarrel
seriously
as
for
a
little
amusing
enough
with
that
she
let
me
go
the
last
i
saw
of
her
was
as
she
ran
hastily
across
the
room
slammed
down
the
window
and
drew
the
curtain
across
it
she
was
afraid
of
hearing
more
of
those
voices
of
the
night
that
frightened
her
i
thought
with
a
smile
that
candles
would
burn
about
her
bed
till
she
woke
to
rejoice
in
the
sun
new
birth
ah
well
i
myself
do
not
love
a
blank
darkness
vohrenlorf
and
i
walked
home
together
we
entered
by
the
gardens
the
sentry
saluting
us
and
opening
the
gate
there
was
the
pavilion
rising
behind
my
apartments
a
long
high
building
the
sight
of
it
recalled
my
thought
from
coralie
to
the
work
of
the
morning
i
nodded
my
head
toward
the
building
and
said
to
vohrenlorf
there
our
rendezvous
he
did
not
answer
but
turned
to
me
with
his
lips
quivering
what
the
matter
man
i
asked
for
god
sake
sire
do
do
it
send
him
a
message
you
must
do
it
my
good
vohrenlorf
you
are
mad
said
i
yet
not
vohrenlorf
was
mad
but
i
mad
with
the
vision
of
my
two
phantoms
freedom
and
pleasure
chapter
xvii
decidedly
medi√¶val
i
was
in
the
garden
pavilion
only
the
other
morning
with
one
of
my
sons
teaching
him
how
to
use
his
weapons
suddenly
he
pointed
at
a
not
in
any
of
the
targets
but
in
the
wainscoting
above
and
a
little
to
the
right
of
them
there
a
bad
shot
father
he
cried
but
you
do
know
what
he
aimed
at
i
objected
at
a
target
of
course
but
perhaps
his
target
was
differently
placed
that
shot
is
many
years
old
anyhow
he
missed
what
he
shot
at
or
he
would
have
struck
the
wainscoting
the
boy
persisted
why
yes
he
missed
but
he
may
have
missed
only
by
a
hair
breadth
do
you
know
who
fired
the
shot
yes
it
a
strange
story
perhaps
you
shall
hear
it
some
day
this
little
scene
recalled
with
vividness
my
memories
of
the
morning
when
wetter
and
i
met
in
the
pavilion
i
had
hit
on
a
good
plan
i
was
known
to
practise
often
and
wetter
was
given
to
the
same
pursuit
indeed
we
had
shot
against
one
another
in
club
matches
before
now
and
come
off
very
equal
it
was
not
likely
that
suspicion
would
be
aroused
the
very
early
hour
was
our
vulnerable
point
but
this
could
not
be
helped
had
we
come
later
we
should
have
been
pestered
by
attendants
and
markers
in
other
respects
the
ordinary
arrangements
for
matches
suited
our
purpose
well
there
was
a
target
at
either
end
of
the
pavilion
each
man
chose
an
end
to
fire
from
when
he
had
discharged
his
bullet
he
retreated
to
a
little
shelter
of
which
there
were
two
at
each
end
one
for
the
shooter
one
for
the
marker
his
opponent
then
did
the
like
to
account
for
what
was
meant
to
occur
this
morning
we
had
only
to
make
it
believed
that
one
of
us
wetter
or
i
as
chance
willed
had
incautiously
stepped
out
of
his
shelter
at
the
wrong
time
to
render
this
plausible
we
agreed
to
pretend
a
misunderstanding
the
man
hit
was
to
have
thought
that
his
opponent
would
fire
only
one
shot
the
man
who
escaped
would
express
deepest
regret
but
maintain
that
the
arrangement
had
been
for
two
successive
shots
i
had
very
little
doubt
that
these
arrangements
for
baffling
inconvenient
inquiry
would
prove
thoroughly
adequate
for
the
rest
i
made
up
a
packet
for
varvilliers
containing
a
present
for
coralie
to
make
any
other
preparations
would
not
have
been
fair
to
wetter
for
my
death
if
it
happened
must
seem
absolutely
accidental
after
all
i
did
not
feel
such
confidence
in
my
value
to
the
country
or
in
my
wisdom
as
to
desire
to
leave
my
last
will
and
testament
victoria
would
do
very
well
no
doubt
it
was
odd
to
think
of
her
sleeping
peacefully
in
the
opposite
wing
without
an
idea
that
anything
touching
her
fortunes
was
being
done
in
the
garden
pavilion
the
external
scene
is
clearer
to
me
than
the
picture
of
my
own
mind
yet
there
also
i
can
trace
the
main
outlines
the
heat
of
passion
was
past
i
was
no
longer
in
the
stir
of
rivalry
i
knew
that
it
was
through
and
because
of
coralie
that
i
had
come
into
this
position
and
that
wetter
had
done
what
he
had
but
the
thought
of
her
and
the
desire
to
conquer
him
in
her
favour
or
punish
him
for
seeking
it
were
no
more
my
foremost
impulses
i
can
claim
no
feeling
so
natural
so
instinctive
so
pardonable
because
so
natural
i
was
angry
with
him
i
had
waived
my
rank
and
set
aside
my
state
that
still
i
was
eager
and
glad
to
do
but
i
waived
them
and
forgot
them
because
only
thus
could
i
avenge
them
by
his
challenge
his
insult
his
defiance
he
had
violated
what
i
held
sacred
in
me
and
almost
the
only
thing
that
i
held
sacred
i
hear
now
the
englishman
mocking
epithet
in
my
ears
medi√¶val
i
did
not
hear
it
then
wetter
had
insulted
the
king
the
king
would
cease
to
be
the
king
to
punish
him
i
had
this
cool
anger
in
my
heart
when
i
went
with
vohrenlorf
to
the
pavilion
at
six
in
the
morning
but
half
the
bitterness
of
it
was
due
to
my
own
inmost
knowledge
that
my
acts
had
led
him
on
that
if
he
had
committed
the
sacrilege
my
hand
had
flung
open
the
doors
of
the
shrine
he
had
defaced
the
image
it
was
i
who
had
taught
him
no
more
to
reverence
it
because
he
reminded
me
of
this
i
thought
that
i
hated
him
as
we
took
our
way
to
the
pavilion
men
who
have
been
through
many
of
these
affairs
have
told
me
that
on
the
first
occasion
they
felt
some
fear
or
at
least
an
excitement
so
great
as
to
seem
like
fear
i
recollect
no
such
feeling
this
was
not
because
i
was
especially
courageous
or
more
indifferent
to
death
than
other
men
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
i
should
be
killed
or
even
hit
coralie
had
a
strong
presentiment
of
evil
for
some
one
i
had
none
for
myself
if
she
were
right
it
seemed
to
me
that
wetter
fate
must
prove
her
so
the
other
pair
came
punctually
they
had
encountered
some
slight
obstacle
in
entering
the
sentry
had
been
seized
with
scruples
and
the
officer
of
the
guard
had
been
summoned
varvilliers
pleaded
an
express
appointment
with
me
and
the
officer
surprised
but
conquered
had
let
them
pass
all
this
varvilliers
told
us
in
his
usual
airy
manner
wetter
sitting
apart
the
while
the
clock
struck
a
quarter
past
six
we
waste
time
vicomte
said
i
and
i
sat
down
in
a
chair
leaving
him
to
make
the
arrangements
with
vohrenlorf
or
rather
to
announce
them
to
vohrenlorf
for
my
second
was
unmanned
by
the
business
and
had
quite
lost
his
composure
varvilliers
had
just
measured
the
distance
and
settled
the
places
where
we
were
to
stand
when
there
was
a
step
outside
and
a
knock
at
the
door
the
seconds
looked
round
wetter
sprang
to
his
feet
open
it
vohrenlorf
we
doing
nothing
secret
i
said
with
a
smile
varvilliers
nodded
approvingly
but
our
visitor
must
stay
long
he
observed
it
one
of
my
privileges
to
send
people
away
said
i
reassuringly
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
william
adolphus
he
was
in
riding
boots
and
carried
a
whip
it
was
his
custom
to
rise
early
for
a
gallop
in
the
park
he
must
have
heard
our
voices
as
he
passed
by
you
early
he
cried
in
boisterous
merriment
what
afoot
why
a
wager
between
wetter
and
myself
i
answered
a
match
what
for
upon
my
word
we
have
fixed
the
stakes
it
pure
rivalry
then
i
began
to
laugh
how
odd
you
should
come
i
said
indeed
it
seemed
strange
for
if
the
whole
affair
were
traced
back
to
the
egg
william
adolphus
flirtation
was
the
origin
of
it
his
appearance
had
the
appropriateness
of
an
ironically
witty
comment
on
some
folly
i
half
a
mind
to
stay
and
see
you
shoot
by
no
means
you
make
me
nervous
i
bet
a
hundred
marks
on
wetter
i
take
you
there
said
i
but
i
hear
your
horse
being
walked
up
and
down
outside
yes
he
there
it
a
chilly
morning
do
keep
him
waiting
vohrenlorf
see
the
prince
mounted
varvilliers
laughed
even
wetter
smiled
all
right
you
need
be
in
such
a
hurry
i
going
said
william
adolphus
but
i
glad
you
came
said
i
laughing
again
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
i
added
most
lucky
his
evidence
will
be
invaluable
fortune
is
with
us
varvilliers
a
man
of
ready
wit
is
with
us
sire
he
answered
in
his
pleasant
courtliness
then
as
we
heard
william
adolphus
trotting
off
and
vohrenlorf
came
back
he
went
on
all
is
ready
wetter
seemed
absolutely
composed
i
marvelled
at
his
composure
no
doubt
his
ideas
were
not
medi√¶val
as
mine
were
yet
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
he
should
fire
at
me
as
he
would
at
any
other
man
i
did
not
then
understand
the
despair
which
underlay
his
iron
quietness
i
was
set
thinking
though
the
next
moment
when
varvilliers
stepped
forward
holding
a
pair
of
pistols
wetter
opened
his
lips
for
the
first
time
why
not
revolvers
if
we
allow
a
second
shot
vohrenlorf
and
i
will
reload
pardon
sire
have
you
any
other
weapon
about
you
i
answered
no
and
wetter
made
the
same
reply
to
a
like
question
but
i
had
seen
a
sudden
change
pass
over
his
face
when
he
was
told
that
revolvers
were
not
to
be
used
an
idea
entered
my
head
and
would
not
be
dislodged
a
man
might
fire
more
calmly
at
the
king
if
he
were
resolved
in
no
case
to
outlive
the
king
i
said
nothing
what
could
i
say
or
do
now
but
strangely
and
suddenly
under
the
influence
of
this
thought
my
anger
died
away
i
saw
with
his
eyes
and
felt
with
his
heart
i
saw
how
he
stood
and
i
knew
that
i
had
brought
him
to
that
pass
was
it
strange
that
he
fired
at
me
without
faltering
although
i
might
be
ten
times
a
king
it
seemed
to
me
almost
just
that
he
should
kill
me
varvilliers
would
not
give
him
a
revolver
did
varvilliers
also
suspect
i
think
his
fear
was
rather
of
our
extreme
rage
against
one
another
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
not
aim
at
my
opponent
but
then
i
thought
i
had
no
right
to
act
thus
it
would
make
matters
worse
for
him
if
i
fell
besides
my
own
life
did
not
seem
to
me
a
thing
to
be
thrown
away
lightly
varvilliers
produced
another
pair
of
pistols
similar
to
those
which
wetter
and
i
now
held
he
loaded
both
fired
them
into
the
targets
and
placed
one
on
a
shelf
at
either
end
of
the
room
those
are
the
first
shots
you
understand
the
gentleman
who
is
hit
made
the
mistake
of
not
expecting
a
second
shot
now
sire
if
you
are
ready
we
took
up
our
positions
each
six
feet
in
front
of
the
targets
a
bullet
which
hit
me
would
but
for
the
interruption
have
struck
on
or
directly
above
or
below
the
outermost
target
on
the
side
vohrenlorf
and
varvilliers
stood
on
either
side
of
the
room
the
latter
was
to
give
the
signal
indeed
vohrenlorf
could
not
have
been
trusted
with
such
a
duty
i
shall
say
fire
one
two
three
said
varvilliers
you
will
both
fire
before
the
last
word
is
ended
are
you
ready
we
signified
our
assent
wetter
was
pale
but
apparently
quite
collected
i
was
very
much
alive
to
every
impression
for
example
i
noticed
a
man
tread
outside
and
the
tune
that
he
was
whistling
i
lifted
my
pistol
and
took
aim
at
that
moment
i
meant
to
kill
wetter
if
i
could
and
i
thought
that
i
could
it
did
not
even
occur
to
me
that
i
was
in
any
serious
danger
myself
are
you
ready
now
said
varvilliers
in
his
smooth
distinct
tones
i
looked
straight
into
wetter
eyes
and
i
did
not
doubt
that
i
could
send
my
bullet
as
straight
as
my
glance
i
felt
that
i
saw
before
me
a
dead
man
i
am
unable
to
give
even
to
myself
any
satisfactory
explanation
of
my
next
act
it
was
done
under
an
impulse
so
instantaneous
so
single
so
simply
powerful
as
to
defy
analysis
i
have
the
consciousness
of
one
thought
or
feeling
only
but
even
to
myself
it
seems
absurd
and
inadequate
to
account
for
what
i
did
yet
i
can
give
no
other
reason
i
had
no
relenting
toward
wetter
as
a
man
as
companion
or
as
former
friend
i
was
not
remorseful
about
my
own
part
in
the
affair
and
did
not
now
accuse
myself
of
being
responsible
for
the
quarrel
suddenly
and
i
record
the
feeling
for
what
it
is
worth
it
came
upon
me
that
i
must
not
kill
him
why
that
englishman
would
laugh
i
am
inclined
to
laugh
myself
well
i
was
only
and
moreover
in
a
state
of
high
tension
fresh
from
great
emotional
excitement
and
a
sleepless
night
because
he
was
one
of
my
people
and
great
among
them
because
he
might
do
great
things
for
them
because
he
was
one
of
those
given
to
me
for
whom
i
was
answerable
i
can
get
no
nearer
to
it
it
was
something
of
that
kind
some
conception
of
it
may
be
gained
if
i
say
that
i
have
never
signed
a
without
a
struggle
against
a
somewhat
similar
feeling
whatever
it
was
it
resulted
in
an
inability
to
try
to
kill
him
as
varvilliers
voice
pronounced
in
clear
quiet
tones
fire
i
shifted
my
aim
gently
and
imperceptibly
if
it
were
true
now
the
ball
would
pass
his
ear
and
bury
itself
in
the
wainscoting
behind
one
two
three
i
fired
on
the
last
word
i
saw
the
smoke
of
wetter
pistol
he
stood
motionless
in
an
instant
i
felt
myself
hit
i
was
amazed
i
was
hit
shot
through
the
body
i
staggered
and
should
have
fallen
vohrenlorf
ran
to
me
and
i
sank
back
in
his
arms
my
head
was
clear
and
i
saw
the
order
of
events
that
followed
varvilliers
also
had
started
toward
me
suddenly
he
stopped
wetter
had
rushed
across
the
room
toward
where
the
cartridges
lay
varvilliers
sprang
upon
him
and
caught
him
resolutely
by
the
shoulders
i
myself
cried
stop
him
even
as
i
sank
on
the
ground
my
shoulders
propped
up
against
the
wall
before
more
could
happen
there
was
a
loud
rapping
at
the
door
and
the
handle
was
twisted
furiously
somebody
cried
go
for
a
doctor
then
came
voice
you
go
wetter
we
trust
you
to
go
who
the
devil
at
the
door
he
sprang
across
and
opened
it
vohrenlorf
was
asking
me
in
trembling
whispers
where
i
was
hit
i
paid
no
heed
to
him
the
door
opened
and
to
my
amazement
william
adolphus
ran
in
closely
followed
by
coralie
mansoni
i
was
past
speaking
soon
i
became
past
consciousness
the
last
i
remember
is
that
coralie
was
kneeling
by
me
vohrenlorf
still
supporting
me
the
rest
standing
round
yet
though
i
did
not
know
it
i
spoke
varvilliers
told
me
afterward
that
i
muttered
an
accident
my
fault
i
heard
what
they
said
though
i
was
unconscious
of
speaking
myself
it
was
coralie
cried
on
my
honour
a
pure
accident
said
varvilliers
then
the
whole
scene
faded
away
from
me
illustration
on
my
honour
a
pure
accident
said
varvilliers
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
wetter
intention
to
take
his
own
life
in
case
he
hit
me
i
had
discovered
this
resolution
varvilliers
was
not
behind
me
had
revolvers
been
employed
no
power
could
have
hindered
wetter
from
carrying
out
his
purpose
but
varvilliers
had
prevented
this
and
by
despatching
my
antagonist
to
seek
medical
aid
had
put
him
on
his
he
returned
with
one
of
my
surgeons
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
perhaps
the
desperate
fit
had
passed
then
perhaps
he
had
come
to
feel
that
he
must
face
the
consequences
of
his
act
i
know
that
varvilliers
spoke
to
him
again
and
very
urgently
obtaining
at
last
a
pledge
from
him
that
he
would
at
least
await
the
verdict
on
my
case
but
when
he
had
fired
at
me
he
had
considered
himself
as
a
man
in
any
event
doomed
to
death
we
are
strangely
at
fault
in
our
forecasts
of
fate
he
was
uninjured
i
who
had
been
confident
of
escaping
unhurt
lay
on
the
edge
between
life
and
death
my
presentiment
was
signally
falsified
but
we
must
be
just
even
to
superstitions
i
had
my
presentiment
and
it
was
wrong
coralie
mansoni
also
had
hers
and
most
unfortunately
for
from
hers
came
the
sole
danger
that
threatened
the
success
of
our
scheme
and
impaired
the
perfection
of
our
pretences
had
william
adolphus
been
a
man
of
strong
will
no
harm
would
have
been
done
but
he
was
as
wax
in
her
hands
when
he
left
us
he
went
on
his
ride
and
in
the
park
he
met
her
driving
herself
in
her
little
she
had
been
quite
unable
to
sleep
she
said
and
had
been
tempted
by
the
fine
morning
had
he
seen
the
king
william
adolphus
without
a
thought
of
indiscretion
described
how
he
had
found
us
in
the
pavilion
in
an
instant
her
mind
inflamed
by
her
fancies
and
readily
suspicious
was
on
fire
with
fear
fear
turned
to
an
instinctive
certainty
my
was
amazed
at
her
agitation
she
swept
away
his
opposition
he
must
take
her
to
the
pavilion
or
she
would
go
alone
nothing
else
would
serve
but
he
should
have
held
her
where
she
was
by
main
force
rather
than
bring
her
the
one
fatal
thing
was
to
allow
her
to
appear
in
the
affair
at
all
he
could
not
withstand
her
he
did
not
know
the
extent
of
his
error
but
he
knew
that
to
bring
her
within
the
precincts
of
the
palace
was
a
sore
indiscretion
she
overbore
him
they
burst
together
into
the
room
as
i
have
described
and
being
there
she
would
not
go
and
was
seen
by
two
doctors
by
baptiste
and
by
the
who
came
to
carry
me
to
my
apartments
then
at
last
varvilliers
prevailed
on
her
to
allow
herself
to
be
smuggled
out
through
the
back
gate
of
the
gardens
and
himself
took
her
to
her
house
in
a
condition
of
great
distress
and
collapse
she
at
least
was
not
deceived
by
the
pretence
of
an
accident
were
other
people
i
feel
myself
on
doubtful
ground
what
was
said
at
the
moment
i
know
only
by
hearsay
for
i
was
incapable
of
attending
to
anything
for
three
months
there
was
an
enormous
amount
of
gossip
and
of
talk
there
were
i
think
many
hints
and
smiles
there
were
hundreds
of
people
who
knew
the
truth
but
were
careful
not
to
submit
their
versions
to
the
test
of
publicity
but
what
could
be
done
varvilliers
and
vohrenlorf
men
of
unblemished
honour
were
firm
in
their
assertions
and
unshaken
in
their
evidence
wetter
obvious
consternation
at
the
event
was
invoked
as
confirmatory
evidence
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
give
my
account
my
voice
and
authority
were
cast
decisively
into
the
same
scale
men
might
suspect
and
women
might
gossip
nothing
could
be
done
and
as
soon
as
the
first
stir
was
over
wetter
left
for
a
tour
abroad
without
any
opposition
and
carrying
with
him
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
the
king
own
carelessness
was
of
course
responsible
but
it
was
very
terrible
for
wetter
so
they
said
but
a
point
remains
how
did
we
account
for
coralie
and
the
presence
of
coralie
in
fact
we
never
did
account
very
satisfactorily
for
coralie
we
sacrificed
or
rather
varvilliers
and
vohrenlorf
sacrificed
william
adolphus
without
hesitation
saying
truly
enough
that
he
had
brought
her
victoria
was
extremely
angry
and
my
much
aggrieved
but
i
must
admit
that
the
story
met
with
very
hesitating
acceptance
some
denied
it
altogether
the
more
perceived
that
even
were
its
truth
allowed
it
presupposed
more
than
it
told
there
was
something
in
the
background
that
was
what
everybody
thought
what
that
was
what
nobody
knew
however
i
am
afraid
that
there
were
quite
enough
suspicion
and
enough
talk
to
justify
my
english
friend
in
his
remark
about
the
one
or
two
scandals
which
attached
themselves
to
my
name
i
beg
leave
to
hope
that
his
charitable
expression
of
surprise
that
there
were
not
more
may
be
considered
equally
well
justified
while
i
lay
ill
princess
heinrich
was
the
dominant
influence
in
the
administration
of
affairs
when
i
recovered
i
found
that
coralie
mansoni
was
no
longer
playing
in
forstadt
and
had
left
the
town
some
weeks
before
i
put
no
questions
to
my
mother
i
also
found
that
varvilliers
had
resigned
his
official
position
in
the
french
service
and
remained
in
forstadt
as
a
private
person
here
again
at
varvilliers
own
request
i
put
no
questions
to
my
mother
finally
i
was
informed
that
the
bartensteins
had
offered
themselves
for
a
visit
again
i
put
no
questions
to
my
mother
i
determined
however
not
to
be
laid
on
the
shelf
again
for
three
months
if
i
could
help
it
such
is
the
history
of
my
secret
duel
with
wetter
and
of
my
acquaintance
with
coralie
mansoni
up
to
the
date
of
that
occurrence
such
also
is
the
story
of
that
apparently
very
bad
shot
which
my
little
son
found
in
the
wainscoting
of
the
garden
pavilion
but
it
was
not
such
a
very
bad
shot
not
everybody
would
have
gone
so
near
and
yet
made
sure
of
not
hitting
chapter
xviii
william
adolphus
hits
the
mark
at
artenberg
whither
we
went
when
i
was
convalescent
the
family
atmosphere
recalled
old
days
we
were
all
in
disgrace
victoria
because
she
had
not
managed
her
husband
better
william
adolphus
for
behaviour
confessedly
scandalous
i
by
reason
of
those
rumours
at
which
i
have
hinted
my
sister
and
were
told
of
their
faults
and
warned
the
one
against
professors
the
other
against
actresses
my
delinquencies
were
treated
with
absolute
silence
princess
heinrich
reminded
me
how
i
had
degraded
my
office
by
a
studious
though
cold
deference
toward
it
on
her
own
part
the
king
was
the
king
be
he
never
so
unruly
his
mother
could
only
disapprove
and
grieve
in
silence
but
in
the
hands
of
princess
heinrich
silence
was
a
trenchant
weapon
william
adolphus
also
was
very
sulky
with
me
i
found
some
excuse
for
him
toward
his
wife
he
wore
a
air
from
princess
heinrich
he
fairly
ran
away
whenever
he
could
in
these
relations
toward
one
another
we
settled
down
to
pass
a
couple
of
summer
months
at
artenberg
now
was
early
july
in
august
would
come
the
visit
of
the
bartensteins
beside
this
great
fact
all
else
troubled
me
little
i
fell
victim
to
an
engrossing
selfishness
the
quarrels
and
woes
of
my
kindred
went
unnoticed
except
when
they
served
for
a
moment
amusement
to
the
fortunes
of
those
with
whom
i
had
lately
been
so
much
concerned
of
wetter
and
of
coralie
i
was
almost
indifferent
varvilliers
wrote
to
me
and
i
answered
in
friendly
fashion
but
i
did
not
at
that
time
desire
his
presence
so
far
as
my
thoughts
dwelt
on
the
past
they
overleaped
what
was
immediately
behind
and
took
me
back
to
my
first
rebellion
my
first
struggle
against
the
fate
of
my
life
my
first
refusal
to
run
into
the
mould
i
remembered
my
governor
comforting
assurance
that
i
had
still
six
years
i
remembered
the
dedication
of
my
early
love
to
the
countess
then
i
had
cherished
delusions
thinking
that
the
fate
might
be
avoided
herein
lay
the
sincerity
and
honesty
of
that
first
attachment
and
an
enduring
quality
which
made
good
for
it
its
footing
in
memory
in
it
i
was
not
passing
the
time
or
merely
yielding
to
a
desire
for
enjoyment
i
was
struggling
with
necessity
the
high
issue
had
seemed
to
lend
some
dignity
even
to
a
boy
raw
a
dignity
that
shone
dimly
through
thick
folds
of
encircling
absurdity
i
had
not
been
particularly
absurd
in
regard
to
coralie
mansoni
but
neither
had
there
been
in
that
affair
any
redeeming
worthiness
or
dignity
of
conception
or
of
struggle
now
all
seemed
over
struggle
and
waywardness
the
dignified
and
undignified
the
absurdly
pathetic
and
the
recklessly
impulsive
the
six
years
were
nearly
gone
princess
heinrich
steady
pressure
contracted
their
extent
by
some
months
the
coming
of
the
bartensteins
was
imminent
the
era
of
elsa
began
old
prince
hammerfeldt
had
left
a
successor
behind
him
in
the
person
of
his
nephew
baron
von
bederhof
and
this
gentleman
was
now
my
chancellor
and
my
chief
official
adviser
he
was
a
portly
man
of
about
fifty
with
red
cheeks
and
black
hair
he
was
high
in
favour
with
my
mother
the
husband
of
a
buxom
wife
and
the
father
of
nine
children
as
is
not
unusual
in
cases
of
hereditary
succession
he
was
adequate
to
his
office
although
he
would
certainly
not
have
been
selected
for
it
unless
he
had
been
his
uncle
nephew
but
being
the
depositary
of
hammerfeldt
traditions
although
not
of
his
brains
he
contrived
to
pass
muster
he
came
at
this
time
to
artenberg
and
urged
on
me
the
necessity
of
a
speedy
marriage
the
recent
danger
so
providentially
averted
he
said
is
a
stronger
argument
than
any
i
could
use
it
certainly
is
said
i
politely
as
a
fact
it
might
be
stronger
than
any
he
would
be
likely
to
use
and
yet
not
be
impregnable
for
the
sake
of
your
people
sire
do
not
delay
my
dear
baron
said
i
send
for
the
young
lady
i
seen
her
since
she
was
a
child
so
let
her
bring
a
letter
of
identification
you
joke
said
he
there
can
be
no
doubt
her
parents
will
accompany
her
true
true
i
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
relief
there
will
be
really
no
substantial
risk
of
having
an
impostor
planted
on
us
i
am
confident
observed
bederhof
that
the
marriage
will
be
most
happy
you
are
undoubtedly
sire
then
we
wo
lose
a
moment
i
cried
bederhof
looked
slightly
puzzled
but
also
rather
complimented
he
cleared
his
throat
if
only
he
could
have
cleared
his
head
as
often
and
as
thoroughly
as
he
did
his
throat
and
asked
er
there
are
no
complications
i
beg
your
pardon
baron
i
am
ashamed
to
suggest
it
but
people
do
talk
i
mean
no
other
attachment
i
have
yet
to
learn
baron
said
i
with
dignity
that
such
a
thing
even
if
it
existed
would
be
of
any
importance
compared
to
the
welfare
of
the
kingdom
and
the
dynasty
not
of
the
least
he
cried
hastily
i
never
suspected
you
of
such
a
paradox
really
i
assured
him
with
a
smile
and
if
the
lady
should
harbour
such
a
thing
that
would
be
of
equal
insignificance
my
uncle
the
prince
he
began
knew
all
this
just
as
well
as
we
do
my
dear
baron
i
interrupted
come
send
for
princess
elsa
i
am
all
impatience
even
the
stupidest
of
men
may
puzzle
a
careful
observer
on
one
point
as
to
the
extent
of
his
stupidity
i
did
not
always
know
whether
bederhof
was
so
superlatively
dull
as
to
believe
a
thing
or
merely
so
permissibly
dull
as
to
consider
that
he
ought
to
pretend
to
believe
it
perhaps
he
had
come
himself
not
to
know
the
difference
between
the
two
attitudes
certain
ecclesiastics
would
furnish
an
illustration
of
what
i
mean
princess
heinrich
was
quite
another
complexion
of
mind
she
assumed
a
belief
with
as
much
conscious
art
as
a
bonnet
or
a
mantle
just
as
you
knew
that
the
natural
woman
beneath
was
different
from
the
garment
which
covered
her
so
you
were
aware
that
my
mother
real
opinion
was
absolutely
diverse
from
the
view
she
professed
in
both
cases
propriety
forbade
any
reference
to
the
natural
naked
substratum
the
princess
with
an
art
that
scorned
concealment
congratulated
me
upon
my
approaching
happiness
declared
that
the
marriage
was
one
of
inclination
and
having
paid
it
this
seemly
tribute
at
once
fell
to
discussing
how
the
public
would
receive
it
i
believe
however
that
she
detected
in
me
a
certain
depression
of
spirits
for
she
rallied
me
again
with
a
superb
ignoring
of
what
we
were
both
aware
of
on
being
moped
at
the
moment
when
i
should
have
been
exultant
i
am
looking
at
it
from
elsa
point
of
view
i
explained
elsa
really
i
do
see
that
elsa
has
anything
to
complain
of
the
position
beyond
what
she
had
any
right
to
expect
all
was
well
with
elsa
that
seemed
evident
enough
it
was
a
better
position
than
elsa
had
any
right
to
expect
poor
dear
child
i
seemed
to
see
her
rolling
down
the
bank
again
expecting
and
desiring
no
other
position
than
to
be
on
her
back
with
her
little
legs
twinkling
about
in
the
air
i
think
said
i
meditatively
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
in
providing
wives
they
reverted
to
the
original
plan
and
took
out
a
rib
one
would
feel
that
one
rib
had
any
particular
right
to
complain
at
having
its
fortunes
mixed
up
with
one
own
my
mother
remained
silent
i
looked
across
the
terrace
and
saw
victoria
girl
playing
about
the
child
so
like
william
adolphus
said
i
sighing
my
mother
rose
with
deliberate
carelessness
and
walked
away
it
may
be
wondered
why
i
did
not
rebel
i
must
answer
first
from
the
binding
force
of
familiarity
i
hated
the
thing
but
it
had
made
good
its
place
in
the
map
of
my
life
secondly
from
the
impossibility
of
inflicting
a
slight
thirdly
because
i
rather
chose
to
bear
the
ills
i
had
than
fly
to
others
that
i
knew
not
of
who
revolts
save
in
the
glowing
hope
of
bettering
his
lot
i
must
marry
who
was
there
to
be
preferred
before
elsa
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
i
might
remain
single
i
should
have
shared
the
general
opinion
that
such
an
act
was
little
removed
from
treason
it
would
not
only
be
to
end
my
own
line
it
would
be
to
install
the
children
of
william
adolphus
i
did
not
grant
even
a
moment
hospitality
to
such
an
idea
bederhof
was
right
the
marriage
was
urgent
i
must
marry
just
as
occasionally
i
was
compelled
to
review
the
troops
i
had
as
little
aptitude
for
one
duty
as
for
the
other
but
both
were
among
my
obligations
i
was
so
rooted
in
this
attitude
that
i
turned
to
victoria
with
a
start
of
surprise
when
she
said
to
me
one
day
she
very
pretty
i
daresay
you
fall
in
love
with
her
she
was
pretty
if
her
last
portrait
spoke
truth
she
was
a
slim
girl
of
very
graceful
figure
with
small
features
and
large
blue
eyes
which
were
merry
in
the
picture
but
looked
as
if
they
could
be
sad
also
i
had
studied
this
attractive
shape
attentively
yet
victoria
suggestion
seemed
preposterous
incongruous
i
had
nearly
said
improper
a
moment
later
it
set
me
laughing
perhaps
i
shall
i
said
with
a
chuckle
i
do
see
anything
amusing
in
the
idea
observed
victoria
i
think
you
being
given
a
much
better
chance
than
i
ever
had
the
old
grudge
was
working
in
her
mind
by
covert
allusion
she
was
recalling
the
part
i
had
taken
in
the
arrangement
of
her
future
yet
she
had
contrived
to
be
jealous
of
her
husband
that
old
puzzle
recurs
i
suppose
i
mused
that
i
having
a
very
good
chance
i
looked
inquiringly
at
my
sister
if
you
use
it
properly
you
can
be
very
pleasant
to
women
when
you
like
she
sure
to
come
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
you
she
such
a
child
you
mean
that
she
have
no
standard
of
comparison
she
ca
have
had
any
experience
at
all
not
even
a
baron
over
at
waldenweiter
what
a
fool
i
was
reflected
victoria
mother
was
horrid
though
she
added
a
moment
later
she
never
allowed
the
perception
of
her
own
folly
to
plead
on
behalf
of
princess
heinrich
i
expect
you
go
mad
about
her
she
resumed
you
see
any
woman
can
manage
you
augustin
think
of
thanks
dear
i
remember
them
all
i
interposed
the
question
is
how
will
mother
treat
her
pronounced
victoria
it
was
not
the
question
at
all
that
victoria
thought
it
was
merely
illustrated
the
princess
persistent
dominance
over
her
imagination
i
allow
however
that
it
was
an
interesting
although
subordinate
speculation
the
bartensteins
present
visit
was
to
be
as
private
as
possible
the
arrangement
was
that
elsa
and
i
should
be
left
to
roam
about
the
woods
together
to
become
well
known
to
one
another
and
after
about
three
weeks
to
fall
in
love
the
duke
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
on
this
occasion
wise
duke
and
when
i
had
made
my
proposal
mother
and
daughter
would
return
home
to
receive
the
father
blessing
and
to
wait
while
the
business
was
settled
when
all
was
finished
i
should
receive
my
bride
in
state
at
forstadt
and
the
wedding
would
be
solemnized
in
reply
to
my
questions
bederhof
admitted
that
he
could
not
at
present
fix
the
final
event
within
a
fortnight
or
so
he
did
not
however
consider
this
trifling
uncertainty
material
no
more
do
i
my
dear
baron
said
i
here
said
he
is
the
picture
of
your
majesty
which
princess
heinrich
has
just
sent
to
bartenstein
i
looked
at
the
lanky
figure
the
long
face
and
the
pained
smile
which
i
had
presented
to
the
camera
good
gracious
i
murmured
softly
i
beg
your
pardon
sire
it
is
very
like
me
an
admirable
picture
what
in
the
world
was
elsa
feeling
about
it
thanks
to
this
picture
i
was
roused
from
the
mood
of
pure
and
allowed
my
mind
to
ask
how
the
world
was
looking
to
elsa
i
did
not
find
encouragement
in
the
only
answer
that
i
could
honestly
give
to
my
question
just
at
this
time
i
received
a
letter
from
varvilliers
containing
intelligence
which
was
not
only
interesting
in
itself
but
seemed
to
possess
a
peculiar
appositeness
he
had
heard
from
coralie
mansoni
and
she
announced
to
him
her
marriage
with
a
prominent
operatic
impresario
you
have
perhaps
seen
the
fellow
varvilliers
wrote
he
has
small
black
eyes
and
large
black
whiskers
his
stomach
is
very
big
but
for
shame
or
for
what
reason
i
know
not
he
hides
it
behind
a
bigger
gold
locket
coralie
detests
him
but
it
has
been
her
ambition
to
sing
in
grand
opera
is
my
career
she
writes
behold
sentiment
is
sacrificed
and
we
shall
hear
her
in
wagner
she
thinks
that
she
performs
a
duty
and
she
is
almost
sure
that
it
need
not
be
very
onerous
she
is
a
sensible
woman
our
dear
coralie
for
the
rest
i
have
no
news
save
that
wetter
is
said
to
have
broken
the
bank
at
baccarat
and
may
be
expected
shortly
to
return
home
and
resume
his
task
of
improving
the
condition
and
morals
of
the
people
i
hear
reports
of
your
majesty
that
occasion
me
concern
but
courage
coralie
has
led
the
way
come
said
i
to
myself
aloud
if
coralie
although
she
detests
him
yet
for
her
career
sake
marries
him
it
little
becomes
me
to
make
wry
faces
have
i
also
in
my
small
way
a
career
but
coralie
hoped
that
her
duty
would
not
be
very
onerous
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
the
difference
there
was
in
temperament
not
circumstances
i
have
kept
the
duchess
and
elsa
an
intolerably
long
while
on
their
journey
to
artenberg
in
fact
they
came
quickly
and
directly
we
were
advised
of
their
start
and
two
days
of
uncomfortable
excitement
brought
us
to
the
hour
of
their
arrival
for
once
in
her
life
princess
heinrich
betrayed
signs
of
disturbance
to
my
wonder
i
detected
an
undisguised
look
of
appeal
in
her
eyes
as
she
watched
me
at
my
luncheon
which
i
took
with
her
on
the
fateful
day
i
understood
that
she
was
imploring
me
to
treat
the
occasion
properly
and
that
its
importance
had
driven
her
from
her
wonted
reserve
i
endeavoured
to
reassure
her
by
a
light
and
cheerful
demeanour
but
my
effort
was
not
successful
enough
to
prevent
her
from
saying
a
few
words
to
me
after
the
meal
i
assured
her
that
elsa
should
receive
from
me
the
most
delicate
respect
i
not
afraid
of
your
being
too
precipitate
she
said
it
not
that
no
i
shall
not
be
too
precipitate
i
agreed
but
remember
that
that
she
quite
a
girl
and
my
mother
broke
off
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
looked
away
she
like
you
if
you
make
her
think
you
like
her
she
went
on
in
a
moment
i
seemed
suddenly
to
see
the
true
woman
and
to
hear
the
true
opinion
the
crisis
then
was
great
my
mother
had
dropped
the
veil
and
thrown
aside
her
finished
art
i
hope
to
like
her
very
much
said
princess
heinrich
was
a
resolute
woman
the
path
on
which
she
set
her
foot
she
trod
to
the
end
i
know
what
you
persuaded
yourself
you
feel
about
it
she
said
bluntly
and
rather
scornfully
well
do
let
her
see
that
she
would
refuse
me
no
she
marry
you
and
hate
you
for
it
above
all
do
laugh
at
her
i
sat
silently
looking
at
princess
heinrich
you
so
strange
she
said
i
do
know
what
made
you
so
have
you
no
feelings
do
you
think
that
i
asked
smiling
yes
i
do
she
answered
defiantly
you
were
the
same
even
as
a
boy
it
was
no
use
appealing
to
your
affections
i
had
outgrown
my
taste
for
wrangles
but
i
certainly
did
not
recollect
that
either
krak
or
my
mother
had
been
in
the
habit
of
appealing
to
my
affections
krak
appeals
at
least
had
been
addressed
elsewhere
yet
my
mother
spoke
in
absolute
sincerity
it
only
just
at
first
that
it
matters
she
went
on
in
a
calmer
tone
afterward
she
wo
mind
you
learn
not
to
expect
too
much
from
one
another
i
assure
you
that
lesson
is
already
laid
to
my
heart
said
i
rising
my
mother
ended
the
interview
and
resumed
her
mask
she
called
victoria
to
her
and
sent
her
to
make
a
personal
inspection
of
the
quarters
prepared
for
our
guests
i
sat
waiting
on
the
terrace
while
william
adolphus
wandered
about
in
a
state
of
conscious
and
wretched
superfluousness
i
believe
that
victoria
had
forbidden
him
to
smoke
they
came
there
ensued
some
moments
of
embracing
good
cousin
elizabeth
was
squarer
and
stouter
than
six
years
ago
her
cheeks
had
not
lost
their
ruddy
hue
she
was
a
favourite
of
mine
and
i
was
glad
to
find
that
her
manner
had
not
lost
its
heartiness
as
she
kissed
me
affectionately
on
both
cheeks
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
difference
cousin
elizabeth
was
a
little
flurried
and
a
little
apologetic
when
she
turned
to
elsa
i
saw
her
eye
run
in
a
rapid
anxious
glance
over
her
daughter
raiment
then
she
led
her
forward
she
changed
since
you
saw
her
last
is
she
she
asked
in
a
mixture
of
pride
and
uneasiness
but
you
seen
photographs
of
course
she
added
immediately
i
bent
low
and
kissed
my
cousin
hand
she
was
very
visibly
embarrassed
and
her
cheeks
turned
red
she
glanced
at
her
mother
as
though
asking
what
she
ought
to
do
in
the
end
she
shook
hands
and
glanced
again
apparently
in
a
sudden
conviction
that
she
had
done
the
wrong
thing
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
we
ought
to
have
kissed
one
another
on
the
cheek
victoria
came
up
and
i
turned
away
to
give
my
arm
to
cousin
elizabeth
she
so
young
whispered
cousin
elizabeth
hugging
my
arm
she
a
very
pretty
girl
said
i
responsively
pressing
cousin
elizabeth
fingers
cousin
elizabeth
smiled
and
i
felt
her
pat
my
arm
ever
so
gently
i
could
not
help
smiling
in
spite
of
my
mother
warning
i
heard
victoria
chattering
merrily
to
elsa
a
gift
of
inconsequent
chatter
is
by
no
means
without
its
place
in
the
world
although
we
may
prefer
that
others
should
supply
the
commodity
i
heard
elsa
bright
sweet
laugh
in
answer
she
was
much
more
comfortable
with
victoria
a
minute
later
the
arrival
of
victoria
little
girl
made
her
absolutely
happy
i
had
been
instructed
to
treat
the
duchess
with
the
most
distinguished
courtesy
and
the
highest
tributes
of
respect
my
mother
and
i
put
her
between
us
and
escorted
her
to
her
rooms
elsa
it
was
considered
would
be
more
at
her
ease
without
such
pomp
my
mother
was
magnificent
on
such
occasions
she
shone
nevertheless
she
rather
alarmed
honest
cousin
elizabeth
a
perfect
manner
alarms
many
people
it
seems
so
often
to
exhibit
an
unholy
remoteness
from
the
natural
cousin
elizabeth
was
i
believe
rather
afraid
of
being
left
alone
with
my
mother
for
her
sake
i
rejoiced
to
meet
her
servants
hurrying
up
to
her
assistance
i
returned
to
the
garden
elsa
had
not
gone
in
she
sat
on
a
seat
with
victoria
baby
in
her
arms
victoria
was
standing
by
telling
her
how
she
ought
and
ought
not
to
hold
the
little
creature
william
adolphus
also
had
edged
near
and
stood
hands
in
pockets
with
a
broad
smile
on
his
excellent
countenance
i
paused
and
watched
he
drew
quite
near
to
victoria
she
turned
her
head
spoke
to
him
smiled
and
laughed
merrily
elsa
tossed
and
tickled
the
baby
both
victoria
and
william
adolphus
looked
pleased
and
proud
it
is
easy
to
be
too
hard
on
life
one
should
make
a
habit
of
reflecting
occasionally
out
of
what
very
unpromising
materials
happiness
can
be
manufactured
these
four
beings
were
at
this
moment
each
and
all
of
them
incontestably
happy
ah
well
i
must
go
and
disturb
them
i
walked
up
to
the
group
on
the
sight
of
me
victoria
suppressed
her
kindliness
toward
her
husband
she
did
not
wish
me
to
make
the
mistake
of
supposing
that
she
was
content
william
adolphus
looked
supremely
ashamed
and
uncomfortable
the
child
being
suddenly
snatched
by
her
mother
puckered
lips
and
brows
and
threatened
tears
elsa
sprang
up
with
heightened
colour
and
stood
in
an
attitude
of
uneasiness
why
yes
i
had
disturbed
their
happiness
very
effectually
i
did
mean
to
interrupt
you
i
pleaded
nonsense
we
were
doing
anything
said
victoria
i
show
you
your
rooms
elsa
shall
i
elsa
i
believe
would
have
elected
to
be
shown
something
much
more
alarming
than
a
bedroom
in
order
to
escape
from
my
presence
she
accepted
victoria
offer
with
obvious
thankfulness
the
two
went
off
with
the
baby
william
adolphus
still
rather
embarrassed
took
out
a
cigar
we
sat
down
side
by
side
and
both
began
to
smoke
there
was
a
silence
for
several
moments
she
a
pretty
girl
observed
my
at
last
very
i
agreed
seems
a
bit
shy
though
he
suggested
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
me
she
seemed
to
be
getting
on
very
well
with
you
and
the
baby
oh
yes
she
was
all
right
then
said
william
adolphus
i
suppose
said
i
that
i
frighten
her
rather
william
adolphus
took
a
long
pull
at
his
cigar
looked
at
the
ash
carefully
and
then
gazed
for
some
moments
across
the
river
toward
waldenweiter
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
and
my
eyes
followed
in
the
same
direction
thus
we
sat
for
quite
a
long
time
then
william
adolphus
gave
a
laugh
she
got
to
get
used
to
you
he
said
precisely
said
i
for
that
was
pretty
elsa
task
in
life
chapter
xix
great
promotion
i
should
be
doing
injustice
to
my
manners
and
a
more
serious
offence
distorting
truth
if
i
represented
myself
as
a
shy
gaby
afraid
or
ashamed
to
make
love
because
people
knew
the
business
on
which
i
was
engaged
holding
a
position
like
mine
has
at
least
the
virtue
of
curing
a
man
of
such
folly
i
had
been
accustomed
to
be
looked
at
from
the
day
i
put
on
breeches
and
thanks
to
unfamiliarity
with
privacy
had
come
not
to
expect
and
hardly
to
miss
it
the
trouble
was
unhappily
of
a
deeper
and
more
obstinate
sort
rooted
in
my
own
mind
and
not
due
to
the
covert
stares
or
open
interest
of
those
who
surrounded
me
there
is
a
quality
which
is
the
sign
and
soul
of
high
and
genuine
pleasure
whether
of
mind
or
body
of
sight
feeling
or
imagination
i
mean
spontaneity
this
characteristic
with
its
included
incidents
of
unexpectedness
of
suddenness
often
of
unwisdom
and
too
entire
absorption
in
the
moment
comes
i
take
it
from
a
natural
agreement
of
what
you
are
with
what
you
do
not
planned
or
made
but
revealed
all
at
once
and
when
the
heart
finds
it
it
knows
that
it
is
satisfied
the
action
fits
the
agent
the
exercise
matches
the
faculty
thenceforward
what
you
are
about
does
itself
without
your
aid
but
pours
into
your
hand
the
treasure
that
rewards
success
the
very
blossom
of
life
there
may
be
bitterness
reproaches
stings
of
conscience
or
remorse
these
things
are
due
to
other
claims
and
obligations
artificial
perhaps
in
origin
although
now
of
binding
force
beneath
and
beyond
them
is
the
harmony
of
your
nature
with
your
act
sometimes
proud
enough
to
claim
for
itself
a
justification
from
the
mere
fact
of
existence
oftener
content
to
give
that
question
the
whispering
softly
what
matters
that
i
am
by
some
such
explanation
as
this
possibly
not
altogether
wide
of
the
mark
i
sought
to
account
for
my
disposition
in
the
days
that
followed
elsa
arrival
i
was
conscious
of
an
extreme
reluctance
to
set
about
my
task
i
have
used
the
right
word
there
a
task
it
seemed
to
me
the
trail
of
business
and
arrangement
was
over
it
it
was
defaced
by
an
intolerable
propriety
ungraced
by
a
scrap
of
uncertainty
its
stages
had
been
marked
numbered
and
catalogued
beforehand
bederhof
knew
the
to
within
a
fortnight
the
settlement
to
within
a
shilling
the
addresses
of
congratulation
to
a
syllable
to
this
knowledge
we
were
all
privy
god
save
us
how
we
played
the
hypocrite
i
am
fully
aware
that
there
are
men
to
whom
these
feelings
would
not
have
occurred
there
are
probably
women
in
regard
to
whom
nobody
would
have
experienced
them
in
a
very
keen
form
insensibility
is
infectious
we
have
few
scruples
in
regard
to
the
unscrupulous
we
feel
that
the
exact
shade
of
colour
is
immaterial
when
we
present
a
new
coat
to
a
blind
man
had
hammerfeldt
left
as
his
legacy
the
union
with
some
rude
healthy
creature
to
follow
his
desire
might
have
been
an
easy
thing
one
which
on
a
broad
view
of
my
life
would
have
been
relatively
insignificant
i
should
have
disliked
my
duty
and
done
it
as
i
did
a
thousand
things
i
disliked
but
i
should
not
have
been
afflicted
with
the
sense
that
where
i
endured
ten
lashes
another
endured
a
thousand
that
being
a
i
seemed
the
executioner
that
myself
yearning
to
be
free
i
was
busied
in
forging
chains
it
was
in
this
light
that
elsa
made
me
regard
myself
so
that
every
word
to
her
from
my
lips
seemed
a
threat
every
approach
an
impertinence
every
hour
of
company
i
asked
a
forecast
of
the
lifelong
bondage
that
i
prepared
for
her
this
was
my
unhappy
mood
while
victoria
laughed
jested
and
spurred
me
on
while
william
adolphus
opined
that
elsa
must
get
used
to
me
while
cousin
elizabeth
smiled
open
motherly
encouragement
while
princess
heinrich
moved
through
the
appropriate
figures
as
though
she
graced
a
stately
minuet
i
had
come
to
look
for
little
love
in
the
world
i
was
afflicted
with
the
new
terror
that
i
must
be
hated
yet
she
did
not
hate
me
or
at
least
our
natures
were
not
such
as
to
hate
one
another
or
to
be
repugnant
naturally
nay
i
believe
that
we
were
born
to
be
good
and
appreciative
friends
sometimes
in
those
early
days
we
found
a
sympathy
of
thought
that
made
us
for
the
moment
intimate
and
easy
forgetful
of
our
obligation
and
frankly
pleased
with
the
society
which
we
afforded
one
another
soon
i
came
to
enjoy
these
intervals
to
look
and
to
plan
for
them
in
them
i
seemed
to
get
glimpses
of
what
my
young
cousin
ought
to
be
always
but
they
were
brief
and
fleeting
an
intrusion
ended
them
or
more
often
they
were
doomed
to
perish
at
my
hands
or
at
hers
a
troubled
shyness
would
suddenly
eclipse
her
mirth
or
i
would
be
seized
with
a
sense
that
my
cheating
of
fate
was
useless
and
served
only
to
make
the
fate
more
bitter
she
seemed
to
dread
any
growth
of
friendship
and
to
pull
herself
up
abruptly
when
she
felt
in
danger
of
being
carried
away
into
a
genuine
comradeship
i
was
swiftly
responsive
to
such
an
attitude
again
we
drew
apart
here
is
an
extract
from
a
letter
which
i
wrote
to
varvilliers
my
dear
varvilliers
the
state
of
things
here
is
absurd
enough
my
cousin
and
i
ca
like
because
we
are
ordered
to
love
be
friends
because
we
must
be
mates
ca
talk
because
we
must
flirt
ca
be
comfortable
alone
together
because
everybody
prepares
our
for
us
she
is
in
apprehension
of
an
amourousness
which
i
despair
of
displaying
i
am
ashamed
of
a
backwardness
which
is
her
only
comfort
and
the
audience
grows
impatient
had
the
gods
given
them
humour
they
would
laugh
consumedly
surely
even
they
must
smile
soon
and
so
soon
as
they
smile
i
must
take
the
leap
for
my
dear
friend
we
may
be
privately
unhappy
but
we
must
not
be
publicly
ludicrous
as
we
walked
a
yard
apart
along
the
terrace
i
seemed
to
see
a
smile
on
a
gardener
face
if
it
were
of
benevolence
matters
may
not
advance
just
yet
if
i
conclude
that
amusement
inspired
it
even
before
you
receive
this
i
may
have
performed
my
duty
and
she
her
sacrifice
pray
laugh
at
and
for
me
from
your
safe
distance
in
that
there
can
be
no
harm
i
laugh
myself
sometimes
but
dare
not
risk
sharing
my
laugh
with
elsa
she
has
humour
but
to
ask
her
to
turn
its
rays
on
this
situation
would
be
too
venturous
a
stroke
an
absolute
absorption
in
the
tragic
aspect
is
probably
the
only
specific
which
will
enable
her
to
endure
unhappily
the
support
of
pure
tragedy
with
its
dignity
of
unbroken
gloom
is
not
mine
i
forget
sometimes
to
be
unhappy
in
reflecting
that
i
am
damnably
ridiculous
what
i
wonder
were
the
feelings
of
coralie
at
the
first
attentions
of
her
impresario
did
stern
devotion
nerve
her
was
her
face
pale
and
her
lips
set
in
tragic
mode
or
did
she
smile
and
yawn
and
drawl
and
shrug
in
her
old
delightful
fashion
i
would
give
much
to
be
furnished
with
details
of
this
parallel
meanwhile
bederhof
tears
his
hair
for
i
threaten
to
be
behind
time
and
the
good
duchess
tells
me
thrice
daily
that
elsa
is
timid
princess
heinrich
has
made
no
sign
yet
when
she
frowns
i
must
kiss
so
stands
the
matter
i
must
go
hence
to
pray
her
to
walk
in
the
woods
with
me
she
will
flush
and
flutter
but
poor
child
she
will
come
what
i
ask
she
will
not
and
must
not
refuse
but
deuce
take
it
i
ask
so
little
there
the
rub
i
hear
your
upbraiding
voice
man
catch
her
up
and
kiss
her
ah
my
dear
varvilliers
you
suffer
under
a
confusion
she
is
a
duty
and
who
is
impelled
by
duty
to
these
sudden
cuttings
of
a
knot
and
she
does
a
duty
and
would
therefore
not
kiss
me
in
return
and
i
also
doing
duty
am
duty
thus
we
are
both
of
us
strangled
in
the
black
coils
of
that
belauded
serpent
i
did
not
tell
varvilliers
everything
had
i
allowed
myself
complete
unreserve
i
must
have
added
that
she
charmed
me
and
that
the
very
charm
i
found
in
her
made
my
work
harder
there
was
a
dainty
delicacy
about
her
the
freshness
of
a
flower
whose
velvet
bloom
no
has
rubbed
this
i
was
to
destroy
but
at
last
from
fear
not
of
the
gardener
smiles
but
of
my
own
ridicule
i
made
my
start
and
as
i
foreshadowed
to
varvilliers
it
was
as
we
walked
in
the
woods
that
i
began
what
of
that
grenadier
i
asked
her
she
was
sitting
on
a
seat
while
i
leaned
against
a
the
grenadier
you
were
in
love
with
when
i
was
at
bartenstein
you
remember
you
described
him
to
me
she
blushed
and
laughed
a
little
he
married
a
maid
of
my
mother
and
became
one
of
the
he
grown
so
fat
the
dream
is
ended
then
yes
if
it
ever
began
she
answered
how
amused
at
me
you
must
have
been
suddenly
she
perceived
my
gaze
on
her
and
her
eyes
fell
he
was
romance
elsa
said
i
he
has
married
and
grown
fat
his
business
now
is
to
shut
doors
he
has
shut
the
door
on
himself
yes
she
answered
he
had
an
unsuccessful
rival
said
i
do
you
recollect
him
a
lanky
boy
whom
nobody
cared
much
about
elsa
the
grenadier
is
out
of
the
question
now
she
was
agitated
but
she
sat
still
and
silent
i
moved
and
stood
before
her
my
whole
desire
was
to
mitigate
her
fear
and
shrinking
she
looked
up
at
me
gravely
and
steadily
it
went
to
my
heart
that
the
grenadier
was
out
of
the
question
her
lips
quivered
but
she
maintained
a
tolerable
composure
you
should
not
say
that
about
about
the
lanky
boy
augustin
said
she
we
all
liked
him
i
liked
him
well
he
deserved
it
a
little
better
then
than
now
yet
perhaps
since
the
grenadier
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
about
the
grenadier
yes
do
you
i
asked
with
a
smile
no
dreams
elsa
that
you
told
to
nobody
she
flushed
for
a
moment
then
she
smiled
her
smiling
heartened
me
and
i
went
on
in
lighter
vein
one
can
never
be
sure
of
being
miserable
i
said
no
she
murmured
softly
raising
her
eyes
a
moment
to
mine
the
glance
was
brief
but
hinted
a
coquetry
whose
natural
play
would
have
delighted
well
the
grenadier
she
seemed
very
pretty
sitting
there
in
the
with
the
sun
catching
her
fair
hair
i
stood
looking
down
on
her
presently
her
eyes
rose
to
mine
not
of
being
absolutely
miserable
said
i
you
would
make
anybody
miserable
you
kind
are
you
kind
she
grew
grave
as
she
put
her
question
i
made
her
no
answer
in
words
i
bent
down
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
i
held
it
and
she
did
not
draw
it
away
i
looked
in
her
eyes
there
i
saw
the
alarm
and
the
shrinking
that
i
had
expected
but
to
my
wonder
i
seemed
to
see
something
else
there
was
excitement
a
sparkle
witnessed
to
it
i
should
scarcely
be
wrong
if
i
called
it
triumph
i
was
suddenly
struck
with
the
idea
that
i
had
read
my
feelings
into
her
too
completely
it
might
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
she
wished
to
marry
me
but
was
there
not
something
in
her
that
found
satisfaction
in
the
thought
of
marrying
me
i
remembered
with
a
new
clearness
how
the
little
girl
who
rolled
down
the
hill
had
thought
that
she
would
like
to
be
a
queen
at
that
moment
this
new
idea
of
her
brought
me
pure
relief
i
suppose
there
were
obvious
moralizings
to
be
done
it
was
also
possible
to
take
the
matter
to
heart
as
a
tribute
to
my
position
at
the
cost
of
myself
i
felt
no
soreness
and
i
did
no
moralizing
i
was
honestly
and
fully
glad
that
for
any
reason
under
heaven
she
wished
to
marry
me
moreover
this
touch
of
a
not
repulsive
worldliness
in
her
sapped
some
of
my
scruples
what
i
was
doing
no
longer
seemed
sacrilege
she
had
one
foot
on
earth
already
then
this
pretty
elsa
lightly
poised
perhaps
and
quite
ethereal
yet
in
the
end
resting
on
this
common
earth
of
ours
she
would
get
used
to
me
as
william
adolphus
put
it
all
the
sooner
i
took
courage
the
spirit
of
the
scene
gained
some
hold
on
me
i
grew
less
repressed
in
manner
more
ardent
in
looks
i
lost
my
old
desire
not
to
magnify
what
i
felt
the
coquetry
in
her
waged
now
an
equal
battle
with
her
timidity
you
sure
you
like
me
she
asked
is
it
incredible
have
they
never
told
you
how
pretty
you
are
she
laughed
nervously
but
with
evident
pleasure
her
eyes
were
bright
with
excitement
i
held
out
my
hands
and
she
put
hers
into
them
i
drew
her
to
me
and
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
cheek
she
shrank
suddenly
away
from
me
do
be
frightened
i
said
smiling
i
am
frightened
she
answered
with
a
look
that
seemed
almost
like
defiance
shall
we
say
nothing
about
it
for
a
little
while
this
proposal
did
not
seem
to
attract
her
or
to
touch
the
root
of
the
trouble
if
trouble
there
were
i
must
tell
mother
she
said
then
we
tell
everybody
i
saw
her
looking
at
me
with
earnest
anxiety
my
dear
said
i
i
do
what
i
can
to
make
you
happy
we
began
to
walk
back
through
the
wood
side
by
side
less
on
my
guard
than
i
ought
to
have
been
i
allowed
myself
to
fall
into
a
reverie
my
thoughts
fled
back
to
previous
and
having
travelled
through
these
fixed
themselves
on
varvilliers
it
was
but
two
days
since
i
sent
him
a
letter
almost
asserting
that
the
task
was
impossible
to
achieve
he
would
laugh
when
he
heard
of
its
so
speedy
accomplishment
i
began
in
my
own
mind
to
tell
him
about
it
for
i
had
come
to
like
telling
him
my
states
of
feeling
and
no
doubt
often
bored
him
with
them
but
he
seemed
to
understand
them
and
in
his
constant
minimizing
of
their
importance
i
found
a
comfort
i
had
indeed
almost
followed
the
advice
he
would
have
given
me
almost
taken
her
up
and
kissed
her
and
there
ended
the
matter
a
low
laugh
escaped
from
me
why
are
you
laughing
elsa
asked
turning
to
me
with
a
puzzled
look
i
been
so
very
much
afraid
of
you
i
answered
you
afraid
of
me
she
cried
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
terrified
been
she
seemed
to
be
seized
with
an
impulse
to
confidence
it
was
terrible
coming
here
to
see
whether
i
should
do
you
know
you
knew
you
do
oh
no
mother
always
told
me
i
might
she
said
you
were
were
rather
peculiar
i
do
know
enough
about
other
people
to
be
able
to
say
whether
peculiar
she
laughed
but
not
as
though
she
saw
any
point
in
my
observation
i
daresay
there
was
none
and
walked
on
a
few
yards
smiling
still
then
she
said
father
will
be
pleased
i
hope
everybody
will
be
pleased
when
you
go
to
forstadt
the
whole
town
will
run
mad
over
you
what
will
they
do
oh
what
wo
they
do
crowds
cheers
flowers
fireworks
all
the
rest
of
it
and
your
picture
everywhere
she
drew
in
her
breath
in
a
long
sigh
i
looked
at
her
and
she
blushed
you
like
that
i
asked
with
a
laugh
she
did
not
speak
but
nodded
her
head
twice
her
eyes
laughed
in
triumph
she
seemed
happy
now
my
pestilent
perversity
gave
me
a
shock
of
pain
for
her
when
we
came
near
the
house
she
asked
me
to
let
her
go
alone
and
tell
her
mother
i
had
no
objection
to
offer
indeed
i
was
glad
to
escape
a
appearance
rather
recalling
the
footlights
she
started
off
and
i
fell
into
a
slower
walk
she
almost
ran
with
a
rare
buoyancy
of
movement
once
she
turned
her
head
and
waved
her
hand
to
me
merrily
i
waited
a
little
while
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
and
then
effected
an
entry
into
my
room
unperceived
the
women
would
lose
no
time
in
telling
one
another
then
there
would
be
a
bustle
i
had
now
a
quiet
by
a
movement
that
seemed
inevitable
i
sat
down
at
my
and
took
up
a
pen
for
several
minutes
i
sat
twirling
the
quill
between
my
fingers
then
i
began
to
write
my
dear
varvilliers
the
impossible
has
happened
and
was
all
through
full
of
its
own
impossibility
i
have
done
it
that
now
seems
a
little
thing
the
marvel
remains
absolute
absorption
in
the
tragic
aspect
you
remember
i
daresay
my
phrase
that
was
to
have
been
her
mood
seen
through
my
coloured
glasses
my
glasses
am
i
not
too
blind
for
any
glasses
she
has
just
left
me
and
run
to
her
mother
she
went
as
though
she
would
dance
she
is
merry
and
triumphant
i
am
employed
in
marvelling
she
wants
to
be
a
queen
processions
and
ovations
fill
her
eyes
she
is
happy
i
would
be
happy
for
her
sake
but
i
am
oppressed
by
an
anticipation
you
will
guess
it
it
is
unavoidable
that
some
day
she
will
remember
myself
we
may
postpone
but
we
can
not
prevent
this
catastrophe
what
i
am
in
myself
and
what
i
mean
to
her
are
things
which
she
will
some
day
awake
to
i
have
to
wait
for
the
time
yet
that
she
is
happy
now
is
something
and
i
do
not
think
that
she
will
awake
thoroughly
before
the
marriage
there
is
therefore
as
you
will
perceive
no
danger
of
anything
interfering
with
the
auspicious
event
my
dear
friend
let
us
ring
the
church
bells
and
sing
a
and
the
chancellor
shall
write
a
speech
concerning
the
constant
and
peculiar
favour
of
god
toward
my
family
and
the
polite
piety
with
which
we
have
always
requited
his
attentions
for
just
now
all
is
well
she
sleeps
your
faithful
friend
augustin
i
had
just
finished
this
letter
when
baptiste
rushed
in
exclaiming
that
the
duchess
had
come
and
that
he
could
by
no
means
prevent
her
entry
the
truth
of
what
he
said
was
evident
cousin
elizabeth
herself
was
hard
on
his
heels
she
almost
ran
in
and
made
at
me
with
arms
her
honest
face
beamed
with
delight
as
she
folded
me
in
an
enthusiastic
embrace
looking
over
her
shoulder
i
observed
baptiste
standing
in
a
respectful
attitude
but
struggling
with
a
smile
you
can
go
baptiste
said
i
and
he
withdrew
smiling
still
my
dearest
augustin
panted
cousin
elizabeth
you
have
made
us
all
very
very
happy
it
has
been
the
dream
of
my
life
i
forget
altogether
what
my
answer
was
but
her
words
struck
sharp
and
clear
on
my
mind
that
phrase
pursued
me
it
had
been
the
dream
of
max
von
sempach
life
to
be
ambassador
there
had
been
a
dream
in
his
wife
life
it
was
the
dream
of
coralie
life
to
be
a
great
singer
hence
came
the
impresario
with
his
large
locket
and
the
rest
and
now
quaintly
enough
i
was
fulfilling
somebody
else
dream
of
life
cousin
elizabeth
perhaps
i
was
fulfilling
my
own
but
my
dream
of
life
was
a
queer
vision
so
happy
so
happy
murmured
cousin
elizabeth
seeking
for
her
at
the
moment
came
another
flurried
entry
of
baptiste
he
was
followed
by
my
mother
cousin
elizabeth
disengaged
herself
from
me
princess
heinrich
came
to
me
with
great
dignity
i
kissed
her
hand
she
kissed
my
forehead
augustin
she
said
you
have
made
us
all
very
happy
the
same
note
was
struck
in
my
mother
stately
acknowledgment
and
in
cousin
elizabeth
gushing
joy
i
chimed
in
declaring
that
the
happiness
i
gave
was
as
nothing
to
what
i
received
my
mother
appeared
to
consider
this
speech
proper
and
adequate
cousin
elizabeth
was
almost
overcome
by
it
the
letter
which
lay
on
the
table
addressed
to
varvilliers
was
fortunately
not
endowed
with
speech
it
would
have
jarred
our
harmony
later
in
the
day
victoria
came
to
see
me
i
was
sitting
in
the
window
looking
down
on
the
river
and
across
to
the
woods
of
waldenweiter
she
sat
down
near
me
and
smiled
at
me
victoria
carried
with
her
an
atmosphere
of
reality
she
neither
harboured
the
sincere
delusions
of
cousin
elizabeth
nor
save
in
public
sacrificed
with
my
mother
on
the
shrine
of
propriety
she
sat
there
and
smiled
at
me
my
dear
victoria
said
i
i
know
all
that
as
well
as
you
do
we
go
through
it
all
before
when
you
married
william
adolphus
i
just
left
elsa
my
sister
announced
the
child
really
half
off
her
head
she
ca
grasp
it
yet
she
is
excited
i
suppose
it
seems
that
cousin
elizabeth
never
let
her
count
upon
it
i
saw
that
she
was
pleased
it
surprised
me
rather
do
be
a
goose
augustin
said
victoria
very
crossly
of
course
she
pleased
but
i
do
think
she
cares
for
me
in
the
very
least
said
i
gravely
for
a
moment
victoria
stared
then
she
observed
with
a
perfunctory
politeness
oh
you
must
say
that
i
sure
she
does
she
paused
and
added
of
course
it
great
promotion
for
her
great
promotion
i
liked
victoria
phrase
very
much
of
course
it
was
great
promotion
for
elsa
no
wonder
she
was
pleased
and
danced
in
her
walk
no
wonder
her
eyes
sparkled
nay
it
was
small
wonder
that
she
felt
a
kindliness
for
the
hand
whence
came
this
great
promotion
yes
i
suppose
it
is
what
did
you
say
oh
yes
great
promotion
said
i
to
victoria
immense
she
was
really
a
nobody
before
a
hint
of
jealousy
lurked
in
victoria
tones
perhaps
she
did
not
like
the
prospect
of
being
no
longer
at
the
head
of
forstadt
society
there
nobody
in
europe
who
would
have
refused
you
i
suppose
she
pursued
yes
she
lucky
with
a
vengeance
i
began
to
laugh
victoria
frowned
a
little
as
though
my
laughter
annoyed
her
however
i
had
my
laugh
out
the
picture
of
my
position
sketched
by
victoria
deserved
that
then
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
poor
child
said
i
how
long
will
it
last
victoria
made
no
answer
she
sat
where
she
was
for
a
few
moments
then
she
got
up
flung
an
arm
round
my
neck
and
gave
me
a
brief
kiss
i
never
knew
anybody
quite
so
good
as
you
at
being
miserable
she
said
but
i
was
not
miserable
i
was
on
the
whole
very
considerably
relieved
it
would
have
been
much
worse
had
elsa
really
manifested
an
absolute
absorption
in
the
tragic
aspect
it
was
much
better
that
her
thoughts
should
be
filled
by
her
great
promotion
i
heard
suddenly
the
sound
of
feet
on
the
terrace
a
moment
later
loud
cheers
rang
out
i
looked
down
from
the
window
there
was
a
throng
of
the
household
stable
and
garden
servants
gathered
in
front
of
the
window
of
my
mother
room
on
the
steps
before
the
window
stood
slim
graceful
figure
the
throng
cheered
elsa
bowed
waved
and
kissed
her
hand
to
them
they
cried
out
good
wishes
and
called
blessings
on
her
again
she
kissed
her
hand
to
them
with
pretty
dignity
a
pace
behind
her
on
either
side
stood
princess
heinrich
and
cousin
elizabeth
elsa
held
the
central
place
and
her
little
head
was
erect
and
proud
poor
dear
child
the
great
promotion
had
begun
chapter
xx
an
interesting
parallel
i
had
a
whimsical
desire
that
somebody
no
matter
who
should
speak
the
truth
about
the
affair
that
i
myself
should
was
out
of
the
question
nor
would
candour
be
admissible
from
any
of
my
family
even
victoria
could
do
no
more
than
kiss
me
elsa
did
not
know
the
truth
her
realization
of
it
lay
in
the
future
the
future
to
me
ever
so
present
varvilliers
would
not
tell
it
his
sincerity
owned
always
the
limit
of
politeness
i
could
not
look
to
have
my
whim
indulged
perhaps
had
there
seemed
a
chance
of
fulfilment
i
should
have
turned
coward
yet
i
do
not
know
the
love
of
truth
has
been
a
constant
and
strong
passion
in
my
mind
hence
come
my
laborious
trackings
of
it
through
mazes
of
moods
and
feelings
painful
trifling
i
daresay
but
my
whim
was
accomplished
why
and
under
what
motive
spur
it
is
hard
to
guess
i
sent
a
message
to
the
chamber
announcing
my
betrothal
a
debate
on
the
answer
to
be
returned
followed
here
was
a
proper
and
solemn
formality
rich
in
coloured
phrases
and
pretence
no
lie
was
allowed
place
that
could
not
prove
its
pedigree
for
five
hundred
years
then
when
bederhof
and
the
rest
had
prated
there
rose
si
a
man
with
a
face
in
which
passion
had
almost
destroyed
mirth
or
at
least
compelled
it
to
put
on
the
servile
dress
of
bitterness
but
with
eyes
bright
still
and
a
voice
that
rang
through
the
chamber
wetter
was
back
back
from
wounding
me
back
from
his
madness
of
coralie
back
from
his
obscure
wanderings
and
his
reported
somewhere
and
somehow
he
had
got
money
enough
to
keep
him
awhile
and
with
money
in
his
pocket
he
was
again
and
at
once
a
power
in
forstadt
there
must
have
been
strange
doings
in
that
soul
worthy
of
record
but
who
would
be
so
bold
as
to
take
up
the
pen
his
reappearance
was
remarkable
enough
i
asked
whether
he
did
what
he
did
in
malice
in
a
rivalry
that
our
quarrel
and
our
common
defeat
at
the
hands
of
the
paunchy
impresario
could
not
wipe
out
or
whether
he
discerned
that
i
should
join
in
his
acid
laugh
and
as
i
read
his
speech
cry
to
myself
lo
here
is
truth
and
a
man
who
tells
it
for
he
rose
there
in
the
chamber
when
bederhof
sticky
syrup
had
ceased
to
flow
he
spoke
of
my
betrothal
sketching
in
a
poet
mood
with
the
art
of
an
orator
that
perfect
love
whereof
men
dream
painting
with
exquisite
skill
the
man
hot
exultation
and
the
girl
tremulous
triumph
the
spontaneous
leap
of
heart
to
heart
the
world
without
eclipsed
and
invisible
the
brightness
the
glory
and
the
unquestioning
confidence
in
their
eternity
his
voice
rose
victorious
out
of
falterings
his
eyes
gleamed
with
the
vision
that
he
made
then
while
still
they
wondered
as
men
shown
new
things
in
their
own
hearts
his
lips
curved
in
a
smile
and
his
tones
fell
to
a
moderate
volume
such
said
he
are
the
joys
which
our
country
shares
with
its
king
because
they
are
his
they
are
ours
because
they
are
his
they
are
hers
hers
and
his
are
they
till
their
lives
end
ours
while
our
hearts
are
worthy
to
conceive
of
them
they
were
silent
when
he
sat
down
he
had
outraged
etiquette
nobody
had
ever
said
that
sort
of
thing
before
on
such
an
occasion
bederhof
searched
in
vain
through
an
exhaustive
memorandum
prepared
in
the
chancellery
he
consulted
the
clerks
nobody
had
ever
said
anything
in
the
least
like
it
they
were
puzzled
it
was
all
most
excellent
most
loyal
calculated
to
impress
the
people
in
the
most
favourable
way
but
deuce
take
it
why
did
the
man
smile
while
he
talked
and
why
did
his
voice
change
from
a
ring
of
a
trumpet
to
the
rasp
of
a
file
the
chamber
at
large
was
rather
upset
by
wetter
oration
ah
wetter
but
you
had
an
audience
fit
though
small
i
read
it
i
read
it
all
i
in
my
study
at
artenberg
i
alone
my
mind
leaped
with
yours
my
lips
bent
to
the
curve
of
yours
surely
you
spoke
to
please
me
wetter
to
show
that
one
man
knew
to
display
plainest
truth
by
the
medium
of
a
giant
lies
i
could
interpret
the
language
was
known
to
me
the
irony
was
after
my
own
heart
it
dashed
queer
stuff
said
william
adolphus
scratching
his
head
all
right
in
a
story
book
you
know
but
in
the
chamber
do
you
think
he
off
his
head
i
do
think
so
william
adolphus
said
i
victoria
says
it
hardly
hardly
decent
you
know
i
should
call
it
exactly
indecent
no
not
exactly
indecent
he
admitted
but
what
the
devil
did
he
want
to
say
it
there
for
ah
that
i
ca
answer
my
looked
discontented
yet
as
a
rule
he
resigned
himself
readily
enough
to
not
understanding
things
victoria
says
that
princess
heinrich
requested
the
duchess
to
manage
that
elsa
my
dear
william
adolphus
the
transaction
sounds
complicated
complicated
what
do
you
mean
princess
heinrich
requested
the
duchess
not
to
let
elsa
read
it
ah
my
mother
has
always
good
reasons
but
elsa
had
read
it
already
how
unfortunate
wisdom
always
is
did
elsa
like
it
she
told
victoria
that
it
seemed
great
nonsense
yes
she
would
think
so
well
it
is
you
know
said
william
adolphus
of
course
it
is
my
dear
fellow
said
i
yet
i
wanted
to
know
more
about
it
and
observing
that
varvilliers
was
stated
to
have
been
present
in
the
diplomatic
gallery
i
sent
for
him
to
come
to
artenberg
and
describe
the
speech
as
it
actually
passed
when
i
had
sent
my
message
i
went
forth
in
search
of
my
she
had
read
the
report
already
my
mother
measures
had
been
taken
too
late
what
did
pretty
elsa
think
she
thought
it
was
all
great
nonsense
poor
pretty
elsa
my
heart
was
hungry
wetter
had
broken
as
surely
he
had
meant
to
break
the
sleep
of
memory
and
the
sense
of
contrast
i
went
to
her
not
with
love
but
with
some
vague
expectation
a
sort
of
idea
that
contrary
to
all
likelihood
i
might
again
have
in
some
measure
what
had
come
to
me
before
springing
now
indeed
not
whence
i
would
but
whence
it
could
yet
being
still
itself
though
grown
in
an
alien
soil
the
full
richness
of
native
bloom
it
could
not
win
yet
it
might
attain
some
pale
grace
and
a
fragrance
of
its
own
for
these
i
would
compound
and
thank
the
malicious
wit
that
gave
them
me
but
she
thought
it
all
great
nonsense
nay
that
was
only
what
she
had
told
victoria
my
mother
was
wise
and
my
mother
had
requested
that
she
should
not
read
it
when
i
came
to
her
she
was
uncertain
and
doubtful
in
mood
she
did
not
refer
to
the
speech
but
a
consciousness
of
it
showed
in
her
embarrassment
and
in
the
distrustful
mirth
of
her
eyes
she
did
not
know
how
i
looked
upon
it
nor
how
i
would
have
her
take
it
was
she
to
laugh
or
to
be
solemn
to
ridicule
or
to
pretend
with
handsome
ampleness
there
were
duties
attached
to
her
greatness
was
it
among
them
to
swallow
this
but
she
knew
i
liked
to
joke
at
some
things
which
others
found
serious
might
she
laugh
with
me
at
this
extravagance
well
you
read
the
debate
i
asked
they
all
said
exactly
the
proper
things
did
they
i
did
know
what
the
proper
things
were
oh
yes
except
that
mad
fellow
wetter
it
a
sad
thing
elsa
if
only
he
were
a
genius
he
have
a
great
career
she
threw
a
timid
questioning
glance
at
me
victoria
says
that
he
talked
nonsense
she
remarked
victoria
declares
that
it
was
you
who
said
it
well
i
do
know
which
of
us
said
it
first
she
laughed
princess
heinrich
said
so
too
she
said
he
must
have
been
reading
romances
and
gone
mad
like
don
quixote
you
read
some
oh
yes
some
of
course
it
different
in
a
story
so
had
observed
william
adolphus
i
marked
victoria
as
the
common
origin
you
see
said
i
tolerantly
he
a
man
of
very
emotional
nature
carried
away
by
his
feelings
and
he
thinks
other
people
are
like
himself
and
i
laughed
a
little
elsa
also
laughed
but
still
doubtfully
she
seemed
ill
at
ease
i
found
her
venturing
a
swift
stealthy
glance
at
me
there
was
something
like
fear
in
her
eyes
i
was
curiously
reminded
of
victoria
expression
when
she
came
to
krak
with
only
a
half
of
her
exercise
written
and
mistrusted
the
validity
of
her
excuse
indeed
it
was
always
a
bad
one
what
then
had
wetter
done
for
her
had
he
not
set
up
a
hopeless
standard
of
grim
duty
frowning
and
severe
my
good
sister
had
meant
to
be
consolatory
with
her
great
nonsense
remembering
perhaps
the
baron
over
there
at
waldenweiter
elsa
was
looking
straight
before
her
now
her
brows
puckered
i
glanced
down
at
the
hand
in
her
lap
and
saw
that
it
trembled
a
little
suddenly
she
turned
and
found
me
looking
she
blushed
vividly
and
painfully
my
dearest
little
cousin
said
i
taking
her
hand
do
trouble
your
very
pretty
head
about
such
matters
men
are
not
all
wetters
the
fellow
a
poet
if
only
he
knew
it
come
elsa
you
and
i
understand
one
another
you
very
kind
to
me
she
said
and
and
i
very
fond
of
you
augustin
it
very
charming
of
you
for
there
little
enough
reason
victoria
says
several
people
have
been
she
hazarded
this
remark
with
an
obvious
effort
i
laughed
at
that
there
was
also
a
covert
hint
of
surprise
in
her
glance
either
she
did
not
believe
victoria
fully
or
she
was
wondering
how
the
thing
had
come
about
alas
she
was
so
transparent
i
found
myself
caught
by
a
momentary
wish
that
i
had
chosen
as
if
i
could
choose
though
a
woman
of
the
world
whose
accomplished
skill
should
baffle
all
my
scrutiny
and
leave
me
still
the
consolations
of
uncertainty
it
is
probable
that
such
a
one
would
have
extorted
from
me
a
belief
in
her
love
for
five
minutes
every
day
not
for
an
instant
could
that
delusion
live
with
elsa
openness
yet
perhaps
she
would
learn
the
trick
and
i
watch
her
mastery
of
it
in
the
growth
but
at
least
she
should
not
learn
it
on
my
requisition
elsa
sat
silent
but
presently
a
slight
meditative
smile
came
on
her
lips
and
made
a
little
dimple
in
her
chin
her
thoughts
were
pleasant
then
no
more
of
that
grim
impossible
duty
had
wetter
wand
conjured
any
other
idea
into
her
mind
had
his
picture
another
side
for
her
imagination
it
seemed
possible
enough
it
may
well
have
seemed
possible
to
princess
heinrich
when
she
requested
that
elsa
should
not
read
the
speech
princess
heinrich
may
have
preferred
that
such
notions
should
not
be
suggested
at
all
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
there
was
always
a
meaning
in
what
princess
heinrich
did
what
are
you
thinking
of
elsa
nothing
she
answered
with
a
little
start
is
he
a
young
man
you
mean
wetter
yes
oh
a
few
years
over
thirty
but
he
made
the
most
of
his
time
in
the
world
the
most
not
the
best
i
mean
you
know
her
thoughts
had
been
on
wetter
and
wetter
words
since
she
had
smiled
i
concluded
that
my
guess
was
not
far
off
elsa
turned
to
me
with
a
blush
and
the
coquettish
air
that
now
and
then
sat
so
prettily
on
her
innocence
i
should
think
he
might
have
made
love
rather
well
she
said
i
should
wonder
in
the
least
said
i
but
he
might
be
a
little
tempestuous
yes
elsa
acquiesced
and
that
would
be
nice
would
it
not
at
all
nice
said
i
and
laughed
elsa
joined
in
my
laugh
but
doubtfully
and
reluctantly
as
though
she
had
but
a
dim
glimmer
of
the
reason
for
it
then
she
turned
to
me
with
a
sudden
radiant
smile
fancy
said
she
mother
says
i
must
have
forty
frocks
my
dear
said
i
have
four
hundred
but
is
it
a
lot
i
suppose
it
is
i
remarked
but
have
anything
you
ought
to
have
you
like
the
frocks
elsa
she
gave
that
little
emphatic
double
nod
of
hers
we
talked
no
more
of
the
frocks
then
but
during
the
few
days
which
followed
elsa
perusal
of
wetter
speech
there
was
infinite
talk
of
frocks
and
all
the
rest
of
the
furnishings
and
appurtenances
of
new
rank
the
impulse
which
moved
women
so
different
as
my
mother
the
duchess
and
victoria
to
a
common
course
of
conduct
was
doubtless
based
on
an
universal
woman
instinct
all
the
three
seemed
to
set
themselves
to
dazzle
the
girl
with
the
glories
and
pomp
that
awaited
her
at
the
same
time
william
adolphus
became
pressing
in
his
claims
on
my
company
now
victoria
never
really
supposed
that
i
desired
to
spend
my
leisure
with
william
adolphus
she
set
him
in
motion
when
she
had
reason
to
believe
that
i
had
better
not
spend
it
with
some
other
person
so
it
had
been
in
the
days
of
the
countess
and
in
coralie
epoch
so
it
was
now
the
idea
was
obvious
just
at
present
it
was
better
for
elsa
to
think
of
her
glories
than
to
be
too
much
with
me
she
was
to
be
led
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
with
a
bandage
over
her
eyes
a
bandage
that
obscured
the
contrasted
visions
of
wetter
imagination
and
of
my
actual
self
i
saw
their
plan
and
appreciated
it
but
seeing
did
not
forbid
yielding
i
was
not
hoodwinked
but
neither
was
i
stirred
to
resistance
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
kindness
lay
in
not
obtruding
myself
upon
her
in
being
as
little
with
her
as
courtesy
and
appearances
allowed
in
asking
the
smallest
possible
amount
of
her
thoughts
and
making
the
least
possible
claim
on
her
life
they
asked
me
to
efface
myself
to
court
oblivion
to
hide
behind
the
wardrobe
it
was
all
done
with
a
soothing
air
as
though
it
were
a
temporary
necessity
as
though
with
a
little
patience
the
mood
would
pass
almost
as
though
elsa
had
some
little
ailment
which
would
disappear
in
a
few
days
while
it
lasted
men
were
best
out
of
the
way
and
would
show
delicacy
by
asking
no
questions
the
way
in
which
women
act
look
and
speak
when
they
desire
to
create
that
impression
is
clear
and
unmistakable
a
wise
man
goes
about
his
business
or
retires
to
his
his
papers
and
his
books
the
treatment
seemed
to
answer
well
and
its
severity
was
gradually
relaxed
william
adolphus
sighing
relief
i
doubt
not
for
i
was
as
tedious
to
him
as
he
to
me
went
off
to
his
horses
i
was
again
encouraged
to
be
more
with
elsa
under
a
caution
to
say
nothing
that
could
excite
her
she
met
me
with
a
quiet
gay
contentment
seemed
pleased
to
be
with
me
and
was
profuse
and
sincere
in
thanks
for
my
kindness
sometimes
now
she
talked
of
our
life
after
we
were
married
when
princess
heinrich
would
be
gone
and
we
alone
together
she
was
occupied
with
innocent
wonderings
how
we
should
get
on
and
professed
an
anxiety
lest
she
should
fail
in
keeping
me
amused
then
she
would
take
refuge
in
reminding
herself
of
her
many
and
responsible
duties
she
would
have
nearly
as
much
to
do
as
i
had
she
said
and
was
not
her
work
really
almost
as
important
as
mine
princess
heinrich
says
that
the
social
influence
i
shall
wield
is
just
as
important
to
the
welfare
of
the
country
she
would
say
with
that
grave
inquiring
look
in
her
pretty
blue
eyes
all
the
fashionable
folk
in
forstadt
will
think
it
much
more
important
said
i
laughing
especially
the
young
men
elsa
as
if
i
should
care
about
that
she
cried
scornfully
now
and
then
at
intervals
while
i
talked
to
her
the
idea
of
doing
what
my
mother
had
meant
by
exciting
her
came
into
my
head
the
idea
of
satisfying
her
unconscious
longings
and
of
fulfilling
for
her
the
dream
which
had
taken
shape
under
the
wand
of
that
magician
wetter
i
believed
then
that
i
could
have
succeeded
in
the
task
there
may
be
vanity
in
that
opinion
but
neither
lapse
of
time
nor
later
experience
has
brought
me
to
renounce
it
why
then
did
i
yield
to
the
women
prescription
and
renounce
the
idea
of
gaining
and
chaining
her
love
and
her
fancy
for
myself
nothing
in
her
gives
the
answer
to
that
question
it
must
be
sought
in
my
mind
and
my
temper
i
believed
and
i
believe
that
if
i
could
have
stirred
myself
i
could
have
stirred
her
the
claim
is
not
great
wetter
had
done
half
the
work
for
me
and
nature
was
doing
the
better
part
of
the
rest
i
should
have
started
with
such
an
advantage
that
the
battle
must
have
been
mine
this
is
not
merely
perceived
in
retrospect
it
was
tolerably
clear
to
me
even
at
the
time
but
the
impulse
in
me
was
wanting
i
could
have
won
but
i
did
not
truly
desire
to
win
i
could
have
given
what
she
asked
but
my
own
heart
was
a
niggard
it
was
from
me
more
than
from
her
that
the
restraint
came
it
was
with
me
to
move
and
i
could
not
stir
she
was
lovable
but
i
did
not
love
her
she
had
love
to
give
but
i
could
not
ask
for
it
to
marry
her
was
my
duty
to
seem
to
desire
the
marriage
my
there
obligation
stopped
inclination
refused
to
carry
on
the
work
i
had
driven
a
bargain
with
fate
i
would
pay
the
debt
to
the
last
farthing
but
i
could
not
open
my
purse
again
for
a
gratuity
or
a
bounty
i
acquiesced
with
fair
contentment
in
it
and
in
the
relations
which
it
produced
between
elsa
and
myself
there
was
a
tacit
agreement
among
all
of
us
that
a
calm
and
cousinly
affection
was
the
best
thing
and
fully
adequate
to
the
needs
of
the
situation
the
advice
of
the
women
chimed
in
with
my
own
mood
making
love
to
her
would
have
seemed
to
them
a
dangerous
indiscretion
to
me
a
rather
odious
taking
advantage
of
one
who
was
not
a
free
agent
and
a
rather
humiliating
bit
of
pretence
besides
we
had
all
made
up
our
minds
that
matters
had
better
be
left
considerably
below
while
things
stood
thus
i
received
a
letter
from
varvilliers
who
was
at
forstadt
accepting
my
invitation
to
artenberg
his
acceptance
signified
he
went
on
of
course
all
the
town
is
full
of
you
and
your
her
portrait
is
everywhere
your
name
and
hers
in
every
mouth
there
is
another
coupled
with
them
surely
in
a
strange
conjunction
when
they
speak
of
you
and
the
princess
they
speak
of
wetter
also
it
is
recalled
that
you
and
he
were
friends
and
associates
companions
in
amusement
and
sport
especially
of
course
in
pistol
practice
hence
springs
a
theory
that
the
fellow
odd
rhapsody
mad
and
splendid
was
directly
inspired
by
yourself
that
you
chose
him
as
your
medium
desiring
to
add
to
the
formal
expressions
usual
on
such
occasions
an
unofficial
declaration
of
your
private
feelings
so
you
are
hailed
as
a
model
and
most
romantic
lover
and
every
resounds
with
your
praises
early
indiscretions
forgive
a
pen
itself
indiscreet
are
forgotten
and
you
are
booked
for
the
part
of
the
model
husband
an
example
of
the
beauty
and
the
duty
of
marriages
of
inclination
in
high
places
believe
me
your
popularity
is
doubled
and
the
strange
fellow
himself
having
money
in
his
pocket
and
that
voice
of
his
in
magnificent
order
is
to
be
seen
everywhere
smiling
mysteriously
and
observing
a
most
significant
reticence
when
he
is
pressed
to
say
that
he
spoke
at
your
request
and
to
your
pattern
but
for
your
majesty
own
letters
i
should
not
have
ventured
to
be
a
dissenter
from
the
received
opinion
if
you
bid
me
at
any
moment
i
will
gladly
renounce
my
heresy
and
embrace
the
orthodox
faith
meanwhile
i
am
wondering
what
imp
holds
sway
in
wetter
brain
and
i
am
laughing
a
little
at
this
new
example
of
the
eternal
antagonism
between
what
is
the
truth
and
what
is
thought
to
be
the
truth
if
mankind
ever
stumbled
on
absolute
naked
verity
what
the
devil
would
they
make
of
it
by
the
way
i
hear
that
coralie
is
to
make
her
in
paris
in
a
week
or
two
she
being
now
reputably
impresarioed
the
sempachs
have
shown
her
some
civility
i
told
wetter
this
when
i
last
ran
against
him
at
the
club
he
raised
his
brows
twisted
his
lips
scratched
his
chin
looked
full
in
my
face
and
said
with
a
smile
dear
vicomte
madame
mansoni
is
passionately
attached
to
her
husband
they
are
ideal
lovers
your
majesty
shall
interpret
if
it
be
your
pleasure
i
leave
the
matter
alone
this
fellow
wetter
was
very
impertinent
with
his
speeches
and
his
parallels
but
good
heavens
he
had
eyes
to
see
madame
mansoni
and
her
impresario
were
ideal
lovers
surely
the
world
was
grown
young
again
elsa
also
made
her
in
a
few
weeks
i
was
her
impresario
and
she
was
passionately
attached
to
her
impresario
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
laughing
and
wishing
with
all
my
heart
that
i
could
have
a
talk
with
wetter
chapter
xxi
on
the
art
of
falling
soft
the
economy
of
belief
which
wisdom
practices
forbids
us
to
embrace
fanciful
theories
where
commonly
observed
facts
will
serve
our
turn
they
talk
now
about
strange
communications
of
mind
to
mind
my
thought
speaking
to
yours
a
thousand
miles
away
perhaps
or
perhaps
there
is
a
new
fashion
in
ghost
stories
in
any
case
there
was
no
need
of
these
speculations
to
account
for
wetter
being
near
me
at
the
very
time
when
i
was
longing
for
his
presence
from
the
moment
i
read
his
speech
i
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
me
that
my
doings
were
stuff
for
his
meditations
that
his
mind
entered
into
mine
read
its
secrets
and
was
audience
to
all
its
scenes
is
not
the
desire
to
meet
at
least
to
see
the
natural
sequence
of
such
an
interest
and
such
a
given
the
wish
what
was
simpler
than
its
gratification
he
need
ask
no
leave
from
me
and
need
run
no
risk
of
my
rebuff
or
of
princess
heinrich
stiffness
he
knew
all
the
world
of
forstadt
from
favour
or
fear
every
door
opened
when
he
knocked
at
it
he
knew
among
the
rest
victoria
baron
over
at
waldenweiter
from
no
place
could
he
better
observe
the
king
nowhere
else
was
it
so
easy
for
a
man
to
meet
the
king
he
came
to
waldenweiter
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
to
be
near
me
was
his
only
object
by
a
stableman
chance
remark
overheard
as
i
was
looking
at
my
horses
i
learned
of
his
presence
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
varvilliers
was
to
arrive
at
artenberg
we
were
coming
together
again
we
three
who
had
met
last
for
pistol
practice
in
the
garden
pavilion
about
two
i
went
out
alone
and
got
into
my
canoe
it
was
a
beautiful
day
no
excuse
was
needed
for
a
lounge
on
the
water
i
paddled
up
and
down
leisurely
wondering
how
soon
the
decoy
would
bring
my
bird
a
quarter
of
an
hour
proved
enough
i
saw
him
saunter
down
to
the
water
edge
he
perceived
me
lifted
his
soft
hat
and
bowed
i
shot
across
the
space
between
and
brought
the
canoe
up
to
the
edge
of
the
level
lawn
that
bordered
on
the
river
why
what
brings
you
here
i
cried
illustration
why
what
brings
you
here
i
cried
his
lips
curved
in
a
smile
as
he
replaced
his
hat
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
me
a
passion
for
the
baroness
sire
said
he
ah
that
only
a
virtuous
pretence
i
laughed
you
a
less
creditable
motive
why
possibly
but
who
tells
his
less
creditable
motives
i
looked
at
him
curiously
and
attentively
he
had
grown
older
the
hair
by
his
ears
was
gray
and
life
had
ploughed
furrows
on
his
face
well
said
i
a
man
might
do
even
that
who
talks
romance
to
the
chamber
he
gave
a
short
laugh
as
he
lit
his
cigarette
your
majesty
has
done
me
the
honour
of
reading
what
i
said
i
am
told
that
i
suggested
it
so
runs
the
gossip
in
town
does
it
and
your
opinion
on
it
i
think
i
wo
expose
myself
to
your
fire
again
said
i
it
was
careless
last
time
it
would
be
downright
folly
now
then
we
are
to
say
no
more
about
it
he
asked
gravely
not
a
word
tell
me
how
came
you
to
know
that
coralie
loves
her
impresario
you
told
varvilliers
so
his
lips
twitched
for
a
moment
but
he
answered
smiling
because
she
has
married
him
i
heard
something
of
ambition
in
the
case
of
her
career
demanding
the
sacrifice
a
slander
sire
depend
on
it
it
is
said
in
envy
of
her
good
fortune
come
come
you
love
the
baroness
so
much
that
you
must
have
all
the
world
in
love
indeed
i
can
think
of
nobody
more
in
love
than
i
am
think
of
me
wetter
as
though
your
majesty
could
ever
be
absent
from
my
thoughts
said
he
with
a
bow
a
wave
of
his
cigarette
and
a
smile
i
laughed
outright
in
sheer
enjoyment
of
his
and
since
we
parted
where
have
you
been
i
asked
i
have
walked
through
hell
in
such
company
as
the
place
afforded
he
answered
with
a
shrug
that
spoke
ill
for
hell
resources
and
you
come
out
the
other
side
is
there
another
side
then
you
still
there
upon
my
word
i
do
know
it
so
like
other
places
except
that
i
picked
up
money
there
i
heard
that
my
resurrection
made
it
obvious
a
silence
fell
on
both
of
us
then
our
eyes
met
and
he
smiled
kindly
i
knew
you
meant
the
speech
for
me
i
said
i
was
not
entitled
to
congratulate
you
officially
you
have
raised
a
mountain
of
misconception
about
me
in
forstadt
i
complained
a
is
a
suitable
regal
seat
and
perhaps
the
only
safe
one
wo
you
speak
plainly
to
me
yes
if
it
your
pleasure
i
have
least
of
it
of
any
pleasure
in
the
world
well
then
the
countess
von
sempach
grows
no
younger
no
and
coralie
mansoni
has
married
her
impresario
i
know
it
and
my
hair
is
gray
and
your
eyes
are
open
we
both
laughed
and
fell
again
to
smoking
in
silence
at
last
i
spoke
her
hair
is
golden
and
her
eyes
are
shut
said
i
why
did
you
try
to
open
them
was
it
to
look
on
a
fine
sight
but
you
knew
that
the
sight
was
there
she
looked
for
an
instant
then
they
turned
her
head
the
other
way
it
was
pure
devilry
in
me
you
should
have
seen
the
chamber
good
god
bederhof
now
his
eyes
twinkled
merrily
and
my
laugh
answered
their
mirth
one
can
always
laugh
said
i
with
a
shrug
it
was
invented
for
the
world
before
the
fall
and
they
forgot
to
take
it
away
afterward
he
said
but
you
you
take
things
seriously
what
i
have
to
do
yes
but
what
you
have
to
feel
in
truth
i
am
not
even
there
a
consistent
laugher
nor
i
or
we
should
talk
so
much
about
it
look
at
varvilliers
does
he
laugh
on
a
theory
he
coming
to
artenberg
there
at
least
he
laugh
without
any
effort
are
you
staying
here
long
no
sire
one
scene
of
despair
and
i
depart
i
should
like
to
see
you
oftener
why
not
you
are
finally
and
i
for
the
time
respectable
why
not
while
my
money
lasts
i
have
money
of
yours
you
have
more
than
money
of
mine
he
looked
me
in
the
face
and
held
out
his
hand
i
grasped
it
firmly
are
you
making
a
fool
of
this
baroness
i
asked
do
be
afraid
she
making
one
of
me
she
is
very
happy
and
content
i
am
born
to
make
women
happy
i
laughed
again
he
was
whimsically
resigned
to
his
temperament
but
the
mischief
had
not
touched
his
brain
then
the
baroness
hold
on
him
was
not
like
coralie
mansoni
he
would
fight
no
duel
for
her
he
would
only
make
a
fool
of
the
greatest
man
in
forstadt
that
feat
was
always
so
easy
to
him
well
he
said
i
must
return
to
my
misery
and
i
to
my
happiness
said
i
but
you
come
to
artenberg
it
princess
heinrich
house
he
objected
with
a
smile
for
the
time
yes
then
come
to
me
at
forstadt
yes
unless
i
have
disappeared
again
he
put
his
hand
on
the
bows
of
my
canoe
and
thrust
me
out
into
the
stream
then
he
stood
baring
his
head
and
crumpling
up
the
soft
hat
in
his
fist
i
noticed
now
that
his
hair
was
gray
all
over
his
head
he
resumed
his
hat
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
waited
without
moving
till
i
turned
my
back
to
him
having
reached
the
opposite
bank
i
looked
round
he
was
there
still
i
waved
my
hand
to
him
he
returned
the
signal
then
we
both
began
to
climb
the
hill
i
to
artenberg
he
to
waldenweiter
he
to
his
misery
i
to
my
happiness
and
which
is
better
who
knows
at
any
rate
the
baroness
was
pleased
i
mounted
through
the
woods
slowly
although
i
had
been
detained
longer
than
i
expected
and
was
already
too
late
to
greet
varvilliers
on
his
arrival
as
i
came
near
the
terrace
i
heard
the
ring
of
merry
voices
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
household
were
all
there
making
a
brave
and
gay
group
in
the
centre
i
saw
my
family
and
elsa
varvilliers
himself
was
standing
by
princess
heinrich
side
talking
fast
and
with
great
animation
bursts
of
glad
laughter
marked
his
points
there
was
not
a
hint
of
care
nor
a
touch
of
bitterness
here
was
no
laughing
on
a
theory
as
wetter
called
it
but
a
simple
enjoyment
a
acceptance
of
the
world
good
hours
were
they
not
nearer
truth
were
they
not
at
least
nearer
wisdom
a
reaction
came
on
me
in
a
sudden
moment
a
new
resolve
entered
my
head
again
varvilliers
roused
the
impulse
that
he
had
power
to
rouse
in
me
i
would
make
trial
of
this
mode
of
living
and
test
this
colour
of
mind
i
had
been
thinking
about
life
when
i
might
have
been
exulting
in
it
i
ran
forward
to
the
group
and
as
they
parted
to
let
me
through
i
came
quickly
to
varvilliers
with
outstretched
hands
he
seemed
to
me
a
good
genius
even
my
mother
looked
smiling
and
happy
the
faces
of
the
rest
were
alight
with
gaiety
victoria
was
in
the
full
tide
of
a
happy
laugh
and
did
not
interrupt
it
on
account
of
my
arrival
elsa
lips
were
parted
in
a
smile
that
was
eager
and
wondering
her
eyes
sparkled
she
clasped
her
hands
and
nodded
to
me
in
a
delicious
surprised
merriment
i
caught
varvilliers
by
the
arm
and
made
him
sit
by
me
a
cry
arose
that
he
should
repeat
the
last
story
for
the
king
benefit
he
complied
at
once
and
launched
on
some
charming
absurdity
renewed
applause
greeted
the
story
point
a
rivalry
arose
who
should
cap
it
with
a
better
the
contact
of
brains
struck
sparks
every
man
was
wittier
than
his
wont
every
woman
more
radiant
what
the
plague
had
i
and
wetter
been
grumbling
and
snarling
at
down
there
on
the
river
the
impulse
lasted
the
evening
out
after
dinner
we
fell
to
dancing
in
the
long
room
that
faced
the
gardens
my
mother
and
the
duchess
retired
early
but
the
rest
of
us
set
the
hours
at
defiance
and
revelled
far
on
into
the
night
it
was
as
though
a
new
spirit
had
come
to
artenberg
the
very
servants
wore
broad
grins
as
they
bustled
about
seeming
to
declare
that
here
at
last
was
something
like
what
a
youthful
king
court
should
be
william
adolphus
was
boisterous
victoria
forgot
that
she
was
learned
and
a
patroness
of
the
arts
elsa
threw
herself
into
the
fun
with
the
zest
and
abandonment
of
a
child
i
vied
with
varvilliers
himself
seeking
to
wrest
from
him
the
title
of
master
of
the
revels
he
could
not
stand
against
me
a
madman
may
be
stronger
than
the
finest
athlete
no
native
temper
could
vie
with
my
foreign
mood
suddenly
i
knew
that
i
could
do
what
i
had
vainly
tried
to
do
that
for
at
least
i
felt
something
of
what
i
desired
to
feel
the
blood
ran
free
in
my
veins
if
i
did
not
love
her
yet
i
loved
love
and
for
love
sake
would
love
elsa
if
the
barrier
between
us
could
be
broken
down
it
need
never
rise
again
the
vision
so
impossible
a
few
hours
before
seemed
now
a
faint
reflection
of
what
must
soon
be
reality
i
looked
round
for
her
but
i
could
not
see
her
i
started
to
walk
across
the
room
threading
my
way
through
the
merry
company
who
danced
no
longer
but
stood
about
in
groups
bandying
chaff
and
compliments
engrossed
with
one
another
they
hardly
remembered
to
give
me
passage
presently
i
came
on
william
adolphus
making
himself
very
agreeable
to
one
of
his
wife
ladies
have
you
seen
elsa
i
asked
him
what
you
remembered
your
duty
at
last
have
you
he
cried
with
a
burst
of
laughter
no
i
believe
i
forgotten
it
at
last
i
answered
where
is
she
i
saw
her
with
varvilliers
on
the
steps
outside
the
window
i
turned
in
the
direction
which
he
indicated
and
stepped
out
through
the
open
window
day
was
dawning
i
could
make
out
the
gray
shape
of
waldenweiter
was
the
scene
of
despair
played
there
yet
i
gave
but
a
passing
thought
to
old
wetter
his
mad
doings
and
wry
reflections
i
was
hot
on
another
matter
and
raising
my
voice
i
called
varvilliers
where
are
you
varvilliers
i
am
not
varvilliers
but
here
i
am
came
in
answer
from
across
the
terrace
wetter
i
whispered
running
down
the
steps
and
over
to
where
he
stood
what
brings
you
here
i
could
sleep
i
saw
your
lights
and
i
rowed
across
i
been
here
for
an
hour
you
should
have
come
in
no
i
have
been
very
well
here
in
the
fringe
of
the
trees
you
have
had
your
scene
no
he
would
not
sleep
after
dinner
early
and
then
i
go
enough
of
that
i
have
seen
your
princess
you
have
wetter
i
am
in
love
with
her
tell
me
where
she
went
she
has
suddenly
become
all
that
i
want
i
have
suddenly
become
all
that
i
ought
to
be
tell
me
where
she
is
wetter
it
is
not
your
princess
it
is
the
dance
the
wine
the
night
by
god
i
do
care
what
it
is
well
then
she
with
varvilliers
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
i
imagine
for
they
passed
by
here
as
i
lay
in
my
hole
watching
but
he
would
have
heard
my
cry
it
depends
upon
what
other
sounds
were
in
his
ears
they
seemed
very
happy
together
i
saw
that
he
rallied
me
i
smiled
answering
i
not
in
the
mood
for
another
duel
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
then
caught
me
by
the
hand
come
let
slink
along
he
said
we
may
get
a
sight
of
them
i
ca
do
that
no
perhaps
you
ca
walk
up
to
them
send
him
away
and
make
your
love
to
her
i
wait
for
you
here
you
like
to
see
me
before
the
night
out
i
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
shall
i
like
to
see
you
i
asked
yes
he
answered
the
olive
after
the
sweets
he
laughed
not
bitterly
i
thought
but
ruefully
so
be
it
i
said
stay
here
i
started
off
but
he
had
laid
a
cold
hand
on
my
heart
i
was
to
want
him
then
i
should
be
no
lover
for
a
lover
wants
but
one
yet
i
nerved
myself
and
cried
again
loudly
varvilliers
this
time
i
was
answered
i
saw
him
and
elsa
coming
toward
me
his
voice
sounded
merry
and
careless
as
he
shouted
here
i
am
sire
a
moment
later
they
stood
before
me
no
there
was
no
ground
for
wetter
hint
and
could
be
none
both
were
merely
happy
and
gay
both
utterly
unembarrassed
somebody
wants
you
inside
varvilliers
said
i
with
a
nod
he
laughed
bowed
gracefully
to
elsa
and
ran
off
he
took
his
dismissal
without
a
sign
of
grudge
i
turned
to
her
oh
dear
she
said
with
a
little
yawn
i
tired
it
must
be
very
late
i
caught
her
by
both
hands
late
i
cried
not
too
late
elsa
i
bent
down
and
kissed
both
her
hands
why
did
you
run
away
i
asked
i
did
know
you
wanted
me
she
said
in
a
sort
of
wonder
i
looked
full
in
her
eyes
and
i
knew
that
there
was
in
mine
the
look
that
declares
love
and
asks
for
it
if
her
eyes
answered
the
vision
might
be
reality
i
pressed
her
hands
hard
she
gave
a
little
cry
the
sparkle
vanished
from
her
eyes
and
their
lids
drooped
yet
a
little
colour
came
in
her
cheeks
and
the
gray
dawn
showed
it
me
i
hailed
it
with
eagerness
and
with
misgiving
i
thought
of
wetter
waiting
there
among
the
trees
waiting
till
the
moment
when
i
wanted
him
do
you
love
me
elsa
i
asked
the
colour
deepened
on
her
cheeks
i
waited
to
see
whether
her
eyes
would
rise
again
to
mine
they
remained
immovable
you
know
i
very
fond
of
you
she
murmured
but
do
you
love
me
yes
of
course
i
love
you
please
let
my
hands
go
augustin
if
wetter
were
listening
he
must
have
smiled
at
the
peal
of
laughter
that
rang
out
from
me
over
the
terrace
i
could
not
help
it
elsa
started
violently
as
i
loosed
her
hands
now
she
looked
up
at
me
with
frightened
eyes
that
swam
in
tears
her
lips
moved
she
tried
to
speak
to
me
i
was
full
of
brutal
things
and
had
a
horrible
longing
to
say
them
to
her
there
was
a
specious
justice
in
them
veneering
their
cruelty
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
gave
utterance
to
none
of
them
we
were
both
in
the
affair
and
he
is
a
poor
sort
of
villain
who
comforts
himself
by
abusing
his
accomplice
you
tired
i
asked
gently
very
but
it
has
been
delightful
de
varvilliers
has
been
so
kind
he
a
delightful
fellow
varvilliers
come
let
me
take
you
in
and
we
send
these
madcaps
to
bed
she
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
in
a
friendly
trustful
fashion
and
i
found
her
eyes
fixed
on
mine
with
a
puzzled
regretful
look
we
walked
most
of
the
way
along
the
terrace
before
she
spoke
you
not
angry
with
me
augustin
good
heavens
no
my
dear
said
i
i
very
fond
of
you
she
said
again
as
we
reached
the
window
at
last
they
were
ready
for
bed
all
save
myself
i
watched
them
as
they
trooped
away
elsa
on
victoria
arm
varvilliers
came
up
to
me
smiling
in
the
intervals
that
he
snatched
from
a
series
of
yawns
a
splendid
evening
he
said
you
surpassed
yourself
sire
i
believe
i
did
said
i
go
to
bed
my
friend
and
you
presently
i
not
sleepy
yet
marvellous
said
he
with
a
last
laugh
and
a
last
yawn
for
a
few
moments
i
stood
alone
in
the
room
there
were
no
servants
about
they
had
given
up
waiting
for
us
and
the
lights
were
to
burn
at
artenberg
till
the
hour
of
rising
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
out
on
the
terrace
again
i
had
no
doubt
that
wetter
would
keep
his
tryst
i
was
right
he
was
there
well
how
did
you
speed
he
asked
with
a
smile
marvellously
well
said
i
he
took
hold
of
the
lapels
of
my
coat
and
looked
at
me
curiously
your
love
scene
was
short
he
said
perhaps
it
was
long
enough
to
do
what
to
define
the
situation
did
it
need
definition
i
thought
so
half
an
hour
ago
ah
well
the
evening
has
been
a
strange
one
has
it
let
walk
down
to
the
river
through
the
woods
said
i
i
put
you
across
to
waldenweiter
he
acquiesced
and
i
put
my
arm
through
his
presently
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
dance
the
wine
the
night
yes
yes
i
know
i
cried
my
god
i
knew
even
when
i
spoke
to
her
she
saw
that
a
brute
asked
her
not
a
man
perhaps
perhaps
not
they
do
see
everything
she
shrank
from
you
the
tears
were
very
ready
ah
those
tears
heavens
why
have
we
no
such
appeals
what
matter
though
you
do
love
her
do
you
want
me
to
call
myself
a
brute
again
wetter
any
other
girl
would
have
been
free
to
tell
me
that
i
was
a
brute
why
no
no
man
is
free
even
to
tell
you
that
you
a
fool
sire
the
divinity
hedges
you
i
laughed
shortly
and
bitterly
what
he
said
was
true
enough
there
is
however
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
seeing
these
things
for
yourself
just
as
though
you
were
one
of
the
rest
of
us
he
pursued
ah
here
the
river
you
row
me
across
yes
get
into
the
boat
there
we
got
in
and
i
pulled
out
into
it
was
almost
daylight
now
but
there
was
still
a
grayness
in
the
atmosphere
that
exactly
matched
the
tint
of
wetter
face
noticing
this
suddenly
i
pointed
it
out
to
him
laughing
violently
you
are
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
i
cried
how
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
o
lucifer
son
of
morning
i
would
care
for
that
if
i
had
the
trick
of
falling
soft
said
he
learn
it
o
king
learn
it
on
what
padded
bed
falls
william
adolphus
my
laugh
broke
again
through
the
morning
loud
and
harsh
then
i
laid
myself
to
the
oars
and
we
shot
across
to
the
bank
of
waldenweiter
he
shook
my
hand
and
sprang
out
lightly
i
must
change
my
clothes
and
have
my
scene
and
then
to
forstadt
said
he
to
you
sire
yet
remember
the
lesson
of
the
moralist
learn
to
fall
soft
learn
to
fall
soft
with
a
smile
he
turned
away
and
again
i
watched
him
mount
the
slope
of
waldenweiter
in
such
manner
on
that
night
at
artenberg
did
i
having
no
wings
to
soar
to
heaven
and
no
key
wherewith
to
open
the
door
of
it
make
to
myself
out
of
dance
wine
night
and
what
not
a
ladder
mount
thereby
and
twist
the
but
the
door
was
locked
the
ladder
broke
and
i
fell
headlong
nor
do
i
doubt
that
many
men
are
my
masters
in
that
art
of
falling
soft
chapter

ut
puto

fio
the
next
morning
all
artenberg
had
the
air
of
being
rather
ashamed
of
itself
styrian
traditions
had
been
set
at
naught
princess
heinrich
considered
that
the
limits
of
becoming
mirth
had
been
overstepped
the
lines
of
her
mouth
had
their
most
downward
set
nothing
was
said
because
the
king
had
led
the
dance
but
disgrace
was
in
the
atmosphere
we
had
all
fallen
from
heaven
one
may
mean
many
things
by
heaven
and
landed
with
more
or
less
severity
according
to
the
resources
of
padding
with
which
nature
furnished
us
to
varvilliers
case
indeed
the
metaphor
is
inadequate
he
had
a
parachute
sailed
to
earth
gaily
with
never
a
bruise
and
was
ready
to
mount
again
had
any
of
us
offered
to
bear
him
company
his
invitation
given
with
a
heartiness
that
mocked
his
bidden
companions
found
no
acceptance
we
were
all
for
our
own
planet
in
the
morning
it
was
abundantly
clear
that
revels
must
be
the
exception
at
artenberg
victoria
was
earnestly
of
this
opinion
in
the
first
place
the
physical
condition
of
william
adolphus
was
deplorable
he
leered
rueful
roguishness
out
of
bilious
eyes
and
victoria
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
him
secondly
she
was
sure
that
i
had
said
something
what
she
did
not
know
but
something
to
elsa
for
elsa
had
been
found
crying
over
her
coffee
in
bed
in
the
morning
and
every
word
you
say
to
her
now
is
of
such
supreme
importance
victoria
observed
standing
over
my
i
took
my
cigarette
out
of
my
mouth
and
answered
perversely
enough
but
with
an
eye
to
truth
all
the
same
nothing
that
i
say
to
her
now
is
of
the
very
least
importance
victoria
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
much
what
you
do
i
rejoined
and
fell
to
smoking
again
victoria
began
to
walk
about
the
room
i
endured
patiently
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
waldenweiter
i
wondered
idly
whether
the
scene
of
despair
had
been
enacted
yet
it
not
the
smallest
good
making
ourselves
unhappy
about
it
victoria
announced
just
as
she
was
on
the
turn
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
not
the
smallest
i
agreed
it
much
too
late
a
great
deal
too
late
victoria
darted
down
and
kissed
my
cheek
after
all
she
ought
to
think
herself
very
lucky
she
decided
sure
everybody
else
considers
her
so
under
such
circumstances
said
i
it
sheer
perversity
in
her
to
have
her
own
feelings
on
the
matter
but
you
said
something
that
upset
her
last
night
remarked
my
sister
with
a
return
to
the
point
which
i
hoped
she
had
lost
sight
of
this
time
i
lowered
my
guard
in
surrender
certainly
i
tried
to
make
love
to
her
said
i
there
you
see
she
cried
reproachfully
her
censure
of
the
irrelevant
intrusion
of
such
a
subject
was
eloquent
and
severe
it
was
all
wetter
fault
i
remarked
sighing
good
gracious
what
it
got
to
do
with
wetter
i
hate
the
man
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
fell
on
a
box
which
stood
on
my
that
she
asked
diamonds
i
answered
the
necklace
for
elsa
you
bought
the
big
one
you
spoke
of
oh
augustin
how
fortunate
i
looked
up
at
victoria
and
smiled
my
dear
victoria
said
i
it
is
the
finger
of
providence
present
them
to
her
after
luncheon
yes
do
and
mind
you
do
upset
her
again
alas
i
had
no
desire
to
upset
her
again
the
fit
had
passed
my
only
relations
toward
it
were
those
of
an
astonished
spectator
or
a
baffled
analyst
it
was
part
of
the
same
mood
that
had
converted
artenberg
into
a
hall
of
revelry
of
most
unwonted
revelry
but
with
princess
heinrich
frowning
heaven
at
a
discount
and
everybody
rather
ashamed
of
themselves
was
it
likely
that
i
should
desire
to
upset
her
again
the
absence
of
any
such
wish
combined
with
the
providential
diamonds
would
it
might
reasonably
be
hoped
restore
tranquillity
to
elsa
victoria
was
quite
of
this
optimistic
opinion
our
interview
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
bederhof
who
came
to
take
my
final
commands
with
regard
to
the
marriage
arrangements
the
whole
programme
was
drawn
out
neatly
on
a
sort
of
chart
minus
the
rocks
and
shoals
of
course
the
duchess
and
her
daughter
were
to
stay
at
artenberg
for
another
week
it
would
then
be
the
end
of
august
on
the
of
september
they
would
reach
home
remain
there
till
the
of
october
when
they
and
the
duke
would
set
out
for
forstadt
they
were
to
make
their
formal
entry
on
the
and
on
the
a
week
being
allowed
for
repose
festivities
and
preparations
the
marriage
would
be
solemnized
in
the
evening
of
that
day
elsa
and
i
were
to
come
back
to
artenberg
to
pass
the
first
days
of
our
married
life
i
hope
your
majesty
approves
said
bederhof
perfectly
said
i
let
us
go
and
find
the
princess
hers
must
be
the
decisive
word
and
with
my
programme
in
one
hand
and
my
diamonds
in
the
other
i
repaired
to
the
duchess
room
bederhof
following
in
high
contentment
i
imagine
that
there
must
have
been
a
depression
in
my
looks
involuntary
but
reassuring
it
is
certain
that
elsa
received
me
with
more
composure
than
i
had
ventured
to
hope
she
studied
bederhof
chart
with
grave
attention
she
and
her
mother
put
many
questions
as
to
the
ceremonial
there
was
no
doubt
that
elsa
was
very
much
interested
in
the
matter
presently
my
mother
came
in
the
privy
council
round
bederhof
grew
more
engrossed
the
chancellor
was
delighted
one
could
almost
see
the
flags
and
hear
the
cannon
as
his
descriptive
periods
rolled
out
princess
heinrich
sat
listening
with
a
rather
bitter
smile
but
she
did
not
cut
him
short
i
leaned
over
the
back
of
her
chair
once
or
twice
elsa
glanced
at
me
timidly
but
by
no
means
uncheerfully
behind
the
cover
of
the
i
unfastened
my
box
and
got
out
my
necklace
then
i
waited
for
elsa
next
look
it
seemed
entirely
in
keeping
with
the
occasion
that
i
as
well
as
bederhof
should
have
my
present
for
her
my
ornament
my
toy
their
majesties
carriage
will
be
drawn
by
four
gray
horses
said
bederhof
the
good
duchess
laughed
laid
her
hand
on
elsa
and
whispered
their
majesties
elsa
blushed
laughed
and
again
glanced
at
me
my
moment
had
come
i
held
up
my
toy
their
majesties
will
be
dressed
in
their
very
best
clothes
said
i
with
their
hair
nicely
brushed
and
perhaps
one
of
them
will
be
so
charming
as
to
wear
a
necklace
and
i
tossed
the
thing
lightly
over
the
into
elsa
lap
she
caught
it
with
a
little
cry
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
whispered
in
her
mother
ear
jumped
up
and
blushing
still
ran
round
and
kissed
me
oh
thank
you
she
cried
i
kissed
her
hand
and
her
cheek
my
mother
smiled
patiently
it
seemed
to
me
the
duchess
was
tremulously
radiant
bederhof
obviously
benign
it
was
a
pretty
group
with
the
pretty
child
and
her
pretty
toy
for
the
centre
of
it
suddenly
i
looked
at
my
mother
she
nodded
ever
so
slightly
i
was
applauded
and
commanded
to
persevere
bederhof
pursued
his
description
he
went
through
it
all
he
rose
to
eloquence
in
describing
our
departure
from
forstadt
this
scene
ended
he
seemed
conscious
of
a
bathos
it
was
in
a
dull
rather
apologetic
tone
that
he
concluded
by
remarking
their
majesties
will
arrive
at
artenberg
at
seven
and
will
partake
of
dinner
there
appeared
to
be
no
desire
to
dwell
on
this
somewhat
inglorious
conclusion
to
so
eventful
a
day
a
touch
of
haste
betrayed
itself
in
my
mother
manner
as
she
asked
for
the
list
of
the
guests
elsa
had
dropped
her
necklace
in
her
lap
and
sat
looking
before
her
with
an
absent
expression
the
names
of
distinguished
visitors
however
offered
a
welcome
diversion
we
were
all
in
very
good
spirits
again
in
a
few
minutes
presently
the
names
bored
elsa
she
jumped
up
ran
to
a
mirror
and
tried
on
her
necklace
the
names
bored
me
also
but
i
stood
where
i
was
soon
a
glance
from
her
summoned
me
and
i
joined
her
the
diamonds
were
round
her
neck
squeezed
in
above
the
high
collar
of
her
morning
gown
they
look
lovely
in
the
evening
she
said
you
have
lots
more
given
you
i
assured
her
do
you
think
so
she
asked
in
gleefulness
dashed
with
incredulity
scores
said
i
solemnly
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
for
everything
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
with
a
sort
of
penitence
that
i
understood
well
enough
and
an
obvious
desire
to
show
every
proper
feeling
toward
me
i
delight
to
please
you
above
all
things
now
i
answered
but
even
to
myself
the
words
sounded
cold
and
formal
yet
they
were
true
it
was
above
all
things
my
wish
to
persuade
her
that
she
was
happy
to
this
end
i
used
eagerly
the
aid
of
the
four
or
was
it
six
gray
horses
the
necklace
and
their
majesties
in
the
next
few
days
i
was
much
with
elsa
but
not
much
alone
with
her
there
was
of
course
no
want
of
ready
company
but
most
of
those
who
offered
themselves
merely
intensified
the
constraint
which
their
presence
was
expected
to
remove
even
victoria
overdid
her
part
rather
betraying
an
exaggerated
fear
of
leaving
us
to
ourselves
admirable
tact
his
supreme
apparent
unconsciousness
and
his
flow
of
gaiety
made
him
our
ideal
companion
i
missed
in
him
that
sympathy
with
my
sombre
moods
which
bound
me
to
wetter
spirit
to
spirit
but
for
lighter
hours
for
hours
that
must
be
made
light
he
was
incomparable
with
him
elsa
bloomed
into
merriment
and
being
as
it
were
midway
between
us
he
seemed
to
me
to
bridge
the
gulf
of
mind
and
temperament
that
separated
her
from
me
hour
by
hour
she
grew
happier
less
timid
more
her
true
self
i
took
great
comfort
from
this
excellent
state
of
things
no
doubt
i
must
be
careful
not
to
upset
her
as
victoria
said
but
she
was
certainly
getting
used
to
me
as
william
adolphus
said
moreover
i
was
getting
used
to
her
to
the
obligations
she
expressed
and
to
the
renunciations
she
involved
but
i
had
no
more
wish
to
try
to
upset
her
it
must
be
a
familiar
fact
to
many
that
we
are
very
prone
to
mistake
or
confuse
the
sources
of
our
pleasure
and
the
causes
of
such
contentment
as
we
achieve
we
attribute
to
our
surroundings
in
general
what
is
due
to
one
especial
part
of
them
for
the
sake
of
one
feature
the
landscape
whole
aspect
seems
pleasant
we
rob
peter
with
intent
to
pay
paul
and
then
in
the
end
give
the
money
to
somebody
else
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
how
elsa
and
i
came
to
think
that
we
got
on
better
with
one
another
because
we
both
got
on
so
well
with
varvilliers
that
we
were
more
comfortable
together
because
he
made
us
both
comfortable
that
we
came
nearer
to
understanding
each
other
because
he
understood
us
so
admirably
we
did
not
perceive
even
that
he
was
the
occasion
of
our
improved
relations
far
less
did
we
realize
that
he
was
their
cause
and
their
essence
that
it
was
to
him
i
looked
to
him
she
looked
and
that
while
he
was
between
there
could
be
no
rude
direct
contact
of
her
eyes
with
mine
nor
of
mine
with
hers
onlookers
see
most
of
the
game
they
say
but
here
the
onlookers
were
as
blind
as
the
players
there
was
an
air
of
congratulation
at
artenberg
the
king
and
his
bride
were
drawing
closer
together
the
blindness
was
complete
varvilliers
himself
shared
it
of
his
absolute
good
faith
and
utter
unconsciousness
i
who
doubt
most
things
can
not
doubt
had
he
been
wetter
i
should
have
been
alert
for
the
wry
smile
and
the
lift
of
the
brows
but
he
was
his
simple
self
a
perfect
gentleman
unspoiled
by
thought
such
are
entirely
delightful
that
they
work
infinite
havoc
with
established
relations
between
other
people
seems
a
small
price
to
pay
for
the
privilege
which
their
existence
confers
upon
the
world
my
dear
friend
varvilliers
for
whom
my
heart
is
always
warm
played
the
mischief
with
the
relations
between
elsa
and
myself
which
we
all
very
whimsically
supposed
him
to
be
improving
it
was
a
comparatively
small
although
an
interestingly
unusual
thing
that
i
came
to
enjoy
elsa
society
coupled
with
varvilliers
and
not
to
care
much
about
it
taken
alone
it
was
a
more
serious
though
far
more
ordinary
turn
of
affairs
that
elsa
should
come
to
be
happy
enough
with
me
provided
that
varvilliers
were
there
to
shall
i
say
to
take
the
edge
off
me
but
cared
not
a
jot
to
meet
me
in
his
absence
the
latter
circumstance
is
simply
and
conventionally
explained
and
after
all
these
conventional
expressions
are
no
more
arbitrary
than
the
alphabet
which
is
admitted
to
be
a
useful
means
of
communicating
our
ideas
by
saying
that
elsa
was
falling
in
love
with
varvilliers
my
own
state
of
mind
would
deserve
analysis
but
for
a
haunting
notion
that
no
states
of
mind
are
worth
such
trouble
let
us
leave
it
there
it
was
it
was
impossible
to
say
which
of
us
would
miss
varvilliers
more
he
had
become
necessary
to
both
of
us
the
conclusion
drawn
by
the
way
of
this
world
is
of
course
at
once
obvious
it
followed
pat
from
the
premise
we
must
both
of
us
be
deprived
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
i
am
not
concerned
to
argue
that
the
world
is
wrong
and
the
very
best
way
to
advance
a
paradox
is
to
look
as
though
you
were
uttering
a
platitude
in
this
art
the
wittiest
writer
cuts
a
poor
figure
beside
the
laws
of
society
the
end
of
the
week
approached
elsa
was
to
go
varvilliers
was
to
go
so
the
arrangement
stood
elsa
was
to
return
about
varvilliers
return
nothing
had
been
said
the
bandage
was
still
over
the
eyes
of
all
of
us
we
had
not
perceived
the
need
of
settling
anything
about
him
he
was
still
as
insignificant
to
us
as
he
was
to
princess
heinrich
herself
this
being
the
state
of
the
case
there
enters
to
me
one
morning
my
good
cousin
elizabeth
tearfully
radiant
and
abundantly
maternal
the
reason
was
soon
declared
elsa
had
been
found
crying
again
and
wondering
vaguely
what
she
was
crying
about
it
was
suggested
to
her
that
her
grief
was
due
to
approaching
departure
elsa
embraced
the
idea
at
once
it
was
pointed
out
that
a
month
absence
from
me
was
involved
elsa
sighed
deeply
and
dabbed
her
eyes
cousin
elizabeth
dabbed
hers
as
she
told
the
story
then
she
caught
me
in
her
arms
kissed
me
and
said
that
her
happiness
was
complete
what
was
i
to
do
i
was
profoundly
surprised
but
any
display
of
that
emotion
would
have
been
inappropriate
and
ungracious
i
could
appear
only
compassionate
and
gratified
things
do
happen
right
sometimes
you
see
pursued
cousin
elizabeth
triumphing
in
this
refutation
of
some
little
sneer
of
mine
which
she
had
contested
the
day
before
i
knew
you
had
come
to
care
for
her
and
now
she
cares
for
you
i
never
was
indifferent
to
that
side
of
it
i
always
hoped
and
now
it
really
is
so
kiss
me
augustin
dear
i
kissed
cousin
elizabeth
i
was
miles
away
in
thought
lost
in
perplexed
musings
i
comforted
her
and
told
her
that
the
time
would
soon
pass
and
that
then
she
would
have
you
all
to
herself
with
no
tiresome
people
to
interrupt
but
the
poor
darling
still
cried
a
little
but
one
really
grieve
can
one
a
little
sorrow
means
so
much
happiness
later
on
does
it
and
though
i
could
comfort
her
you
be
able
to
i
daresay
what
a
month
nothing
said
i
was
conscious
of
realizing
that
it
was
at
all
events
very
little
i
shall
expect
to
see
her
quite
smiling
after
she
had
a
little
talk
with
you
was
cousin
elizabeth
parting
speech
it
won
from
me
a
very
reassuring
nod
and
left
me
in
mazes
of
bewilderment
there
was
nothing
in
particular
which
i
believed
but
i
disbelieved
one
thing
very
definitely
it
was
that
elsa
wept
because
she
must
be
absent
from
me
for
a
month
a
month
delightfully
busied
with
the
making
of
four
hundred
frocks
impelled
partly
by
duty
but
more
by
curiosity
i
went
in
search
of
her
having
failed
to
find
her
in
the
house
or
on
the
terrace
i
descended
into
the
hanging
woods
and
made
for
an
arbour
which
she
and
i
and
varvilliers
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
frequenting
a
broad
grass
path
ran
up
to
the
front
of
it
but
coming
as
i
did
i
approached
it
by
a
side
track
elsa
sat
on
the
seat
and
varvilliers
stood
before
her
he
was
talking
she
leaned
forward
listening
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
neither
perceived
me
i
walked
briskly
toward
them
without
loitering
or
spying
but
i
did
not
call
out
varvilliers
talk
was
light
if
it
might
be
judged
by
his
occasional
laughs
when
i
was
ten
yards
off
i
called
hallo
here
you
are
he
turned
with
a
little
start
but
an
easy
smile
elsa
flushed
red
i
had
not
yet
apprehended
the
truth
although
now
the
idea
was
dimly
in
my
mind
i
sat
down
by
elsa
and
we
talked
of
what
i
have
forgotten
i
think
in
part
of
william
adolphus
i
laughing
at
my
varvilliers
feigning
to
defend
him
with
irony
it
did
not
matter
of
what
we
talked
for
me
there
was
significance
in
nothing
save
in
elsa
eyes
they
were
all
for
varvilliers
for
him
sparkled
for
him
clouded
for
him
wondered
laughed
applauded
lived
presently
i
dropped
out
of
the
conversation
and
sat
silent
facing
this
new
thing
it
was
not
bitter
to
me
my
mood
of
desire
had
gone
too
utterly
there
was
no
pang
of
defeated
rivalry
but
i
knew
why
elsa
had
cried
who
had
power
to
bring
and
who
also
had
power
to
dry
her
tears
suddenly
i
saw
or
seemed
to
see
a
strange
and
unusual
restraint
in
varvilliers
manner
he
missed
the
thread
of
a
story
stumbled
grew
dull
and
lost
his
animation
he
seemed
to
talk
now
for
duty
not
for
pleasure
as
a
man
who
covers
an
awkward
moment
rather
than
employs
to
the
full
a
happy
opportunity
then
his
glance
rested
for
an
instant
on
my
face
i
do
not
know
what
or
how
much
my
face
told
him
but
i
did
not
look
at
him
unkindly
i
must
go
if
i
may
he
said
addressing
me
i
promised
to
ride
with
vohrenlorf
and
the
time
is
past
he
bowed
to
elsa
and
to
me
we
shall
see
you
this
afternoon
she
asked
he
bowed
again
in
acquiescence
but
with
an
air
of
discomfort
elsa
looked
at
him
and
from
him
to
me
she
flushed
again
opened
her
lips
but
did
not
speak
then
she
bent
her
head
down
and
the
blush
spread
from
neck
to
forehead
go
my
dear
friend
go
said
i
he
looked
at
me
as
though
he
would
have
spoken
almost
as
though
he
would
have
protested
or
excused
himself
inadmissible
as
such
a
thing
plainly
was
i
smiled
at
him
but
waved
my
hand
to
dismiss
him
he
turned
and
walked
quickly
away
along
the
broad
grass
path
i
watched
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
all
the
while
i
was
conscious
of
an
utter
motionlessness
in
elsa
figure
beside
me
we
must
have
sat
there
a
long
while
in
that
unbroken
eloquent
silence
hardly
moving
never
looking
at
one
another
for
her
i
was
full
of
grief
a
wayward
thing
it
was
indeed
of
fate
to
fashion
out
of
varvilliers
pleasant
friendship
this
new
weapon
of
attack
she
had
been
on
the
way
to
contentment
at
least
to
resignation
but
was
now
thrust
back
and
she
was
ashamed
poor
child
why
in
heaven
name
should
she
be
ashamed
should
she
not
better
have
been
ashamed
of
a
fancy
so
ill
directed
as
to
light
on
me
when
varvilliers
was
by
for
myself
i
seemed
to
see
rising
before
me
the
need
for
a
new
deception
a
hoodwinking
of
all
the
world
a
secret
that
none
must
know
or
suspect
that
she
and
i
must
have
between
us
for
our
own
the
thing
might
pass
she
was
young
very
likely
but
it
would
not
pass
in
time
there
were
the
frocks
ah
but
the
wardrobe
that
half
hid
me
would
not
suffice
to
obscure
varvilliers
or
would
it
i
smiled
for
an
instant
instead
of
hiding
behind
the
wardrobe
i
saw
myself
becoming
part
of
it
blending
with
it
should
i
take
rank
as
the
frock
willingly
give
thyself
up
to
clotho
allowing
her
to
spin
thy
thread
into
whatever
things
she
pleases
even
into
a
frock
o
emperor
goes
the
philosophy
as
far
as
that
at
last
i
turned
to
her
and
laid
my
hand
gently
on
her
clasped
hands
come
my
dear
said
i
we
must
be
going
back
they
all
be
looking
for
us
we
too
important
people
to
be
allowed
to
hide
ourselves
as
i
spoke
i
jumped
to
my
feet
holding
out
my
hand
to
help
her
to
rise
she
looked
up
at
me
in
an
oddly
pathetic
way
i
was
afraid
that
she
was
going
to
speak
of
the
matter
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
speaking
of
it
give
me
your
hand
i
said
with
a
smile
and
she
obeyed
the
pleading
in
her
eyes
persisted
as
she
stood
up
i
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
forehead
then
we
walked
away
together
that
afternoon
i
was
summoned
to
princess
heinrich
room
to
drink
tea
with
her
and
the
duchess
cousin
elizabeth
was
still
exuberant
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
cold
watchfulness
governed
my
mother
mood
relations
between
my
mother
and
myself
have
not
always
been
cordial
but
i
have
never
failed
to
perceive
and
respect
in
her
a
fine
inner
sincerity
an
aptitude
for
truth
and
a
resolute
facing
of
facts
while
cousin
elizabeth
talked
the
princess
sat
smiling
with
her
usual
faint
smile
it
never
showed
the
least
inclination
to
become
a
laugh
she
acquiesced
politely
in
the
description
of
elsa
feelings
and
affections
she
had
perception
enough
to
know
that
the
picture
could
not
be
true
presently
i
took
the
liberty
of
informing
her
by
a
glance
that
i
was
not
a
partner
in
the
delusion
she
showed
no
surprise
but
the
fruit
of
my
act
was
that
she
detained
me
by
a
gesture
after
cousin
elizabeth
had
taken
her
leave
for
a
few
moments
she
sat
silent
then
she
remarked
the
duchess
is
a
very
kind
woman
very
anxious
to
make
everybody
happy
yes
said
i
carelessly
but
it
must
be
in
her
own
way
she
is
romantic
she
thinks
everybody
else
must
be
the
same
you
and
i
know
augustin
that
things
of
that
kind
occupy
a
very
small
part
of
a
man
life
my
sex
deludes
itself
and
when
a
man
occupies
the
position
you
do
it
absurd
to
suppose
that
he
pays
much
attention
to
them
no
doubt
cousin
elizabeth
exaggerates
said
i
standing
in
a
respectful
attitude
before
my
mother
well
i
daresay
you
remember
the
time
when
victoria
was
a
girl
you
recollect
her
folly
but
you
and
i
were
firm
you
behaved
very
well
then
augustin
and
the
result
is
that
she
is
most
suitably
and
most
happily
married
i
bowed
i
did
not
think
that
any
agreement
of
mine
could
be
worthy
of
the
magnificent
boldness
of
princess
heinrich
statement
girls
are
silly
they
pass
through
a
silly
time
she
pursued
smiling
a
sudden
remembrance
shot
across
me
it
does
do
to
take
any
notice
of
such
things
said
i
gravely
happily
perhaps
princess
heinrich
was
not
awake
to
the
fact
that
she
herself
was
being
quoted
to
herself
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
she
said
you
have
your
work
to
do
do
waste
your
time
in
thinking
of
girls
megrims
or
of
their
mothers
nonsense
i
left
her
presence
with
a
strong
sense
that
providence
had
erred
in
not
making
her
a
saint
a
king
or
anything
else
that
demands
a
resolute
repression
of
human
infirmities
some
people
are
content
to
triumph
over
their
own
weaknesses
my
mother
had
an
eye
also
for
the
frailty
of
others
she
made
no
reference
at
all
to
varvilliers
there
was
always
something
to
be
learned
from
princess
heinrich
from
early
youth
i
was
inured
to
a
certain
degree
of
painfulness
in
the
lesson
willingly
give
thyself
up
to
clotho
my
mother
was
more
than
willing
she
was
proud
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
vary
the
metaphor
she
embarked
on
the
ship
of
destiny
with
a
family
ticket
chapter
xxiii
a
paradox
of
sensibility
to
many
the
picture
presented
by
my
life
might
seem
that
of
a
man
who
detects
the
trap
and
yet
walks
into
it
sinks
under
burdens
that
he
might
cast
aside
groans
at
chains
that
he
could
break
and
will
not
leave
the
prison
although
the
is
in
his
pocket
such
an
impression
my
record
may
well
give
unless
it
be
understood
that
what
came
upon
me
was
not
an
impossibility
of
movement
but
a
paralysis
of
the
will
to
move
in
this
there
is
nothing
peculiar
to
one
placed
as
i
was
most
men
could
escape
from
what
irks
confines
or
burdens
them
at
the
cost
of
effacing
their
past
lives
breaking
the
continuity
of
existence
cutting
the
cord
that
binds
together
in
a
sequence
of
circumstances
and
incidents
youth
and
maturity
and
age
but
who
can
do
the
thing
one
man
in
a
thousand
and
he
generally
a
scoundrel
our
guests
returned
to
bartenstein
the
duchess
still
radiant
and
maternal
elsa
infinitely
kind
infinitely
apologetic
a
little
tearful
never
for
an
instant
wavering
in
her
acceptance
of
the
future
varvilliers
took
leave
of
me
with
great
friendliness
there
was
in
his
air
now
just
a
hint
of
amusement
most
decorously
suppressed
he
was
charmingly
unconscious
of
any
possible
seriousness
in
the
position
my
mother
went
to
visit
styrian
relatives
victoria
and
william
adolphus
had
taken
a
villa
by
the
seaside
i
was
quite
alone
at
artenberg
save
for
my
faithful
vohrenlorf
and
vohrenlorf
was
bored
to
death
that
will
not
appear
strange
to
me
it
seemed
enviable
a
prisoner
under
sentence
probably
discerns
much
that
is
attractive
even
in
the
restricted
life
of
his
jailer
in
a
day
or
two
there
came
upon
me
a
persistent
restlessness
and
with
it
constant
thoughts
of
wetter
i
wondered
where
he
was
and
what
he
did
i
longed
to
share
the
tempestuousness
of
his
life
and
thoughts
he
brought
with
him
other
remembrances
of
the
passions
and
the
events
that
we
two
had
in
friendship
or
hostility
witnessed
together
they
had
seemed
all
of
them
far
behind
in
the
past
belonging
to
the
days
when
as
old
vohrenlorf
had
told
me
i
had
still
six
years
now
i
had
only
a
month
but
the
images
were
with
me
importunate
and
pleading
i
was
asking
whether
i
could
not
even
now
save
something
out
of
life
three
days
later
found
me
established
in
a
hotel
in
the
place
vendome
at
paris
vohrenlorf
my
only
companion
i
was
in
strictest
baron
de
neberhausen
was
my
name
but
in
paris
in
august
my
was
almost
a
superfluity
for
me
although
a
convenience
to
others
it
was
very
hot
i
did
not
care
the
town
was
absolutely
empty
not
for
me
here
is
my
secret
wetter
was
in
paris
i
had
seen
it
stated
in
the
newspaper
what
brought
the
man
of
moods
to
paris
in
august
i
could
answer
the
question
in
one
way
only
the
woman
of
his
mood
i
did
not
care
about
her
i
wanted
to
see
him
and
hear
again
from
his
own
lips
what
he
thought
of
the
universe
of
my
part
and
his
in
it
and
of
the
ways
of
the
power
that
ruled
it
in
a
month
i
should
be
on
my
honeymoon
with
cousin
elsa
i
fought
desperately
against
the
finality
implied
in
that
on
the
second
evening
i
gave
vohrenlorf
the
slip
and
went
out
on
the
boulevards
alone
in
great
cities
nobody
is
known
i
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
being
ignored
i
might
pass
for
a
student
a
chemist
at
a
pinch
perhaps
for
a
poet
of
a
reflective
type
my
natural
manner
would
seem
no
more
than
a
touch
of
youth
pardonable
arrogance
i
sat
down
and
had
some
coffee
it
was
ten
and
the
pavements
were
full
i
bought
a
paper
and
read
a
paragraph
about
elsa
and
myself
elsa
and
myself
both
seemed
rather
a
long
way
off
it
was
delicious
to
make
believe
that
this
here
and
this
now
were
reality
the
kingship
elsa
the
wedding
and
the
rest
some
story
or
poem
that
i
the
student
had
been
making
laboriously
before
working
hours
ended
and
i
was
free
to
seek
the
boulevards
i
was
pleased
when
a
pretty
girl
passing
by
stared
hard
at
me
and
seemed
to
like
my
looks
this
tribute
was
my
own
she
was
not
staring
at
the
king
satisfaction
not
surprise
filled
me
when
in
about
twenty
minutes
i
saw
wetter
coming
toward
the
i
had
taken
a
table
far
back
from
the
street
and
he
did
not
see
me
the
glaring
gaslight
gave
him
a
deeper
paleness
and
cut
the
lines
of
his
face
to
a
sharper
edge
he
was
talking
with
great
animation
his
hands
moving
constantly
in
eager
gesture
i
was
within
an
ace
of
springing
forward
to
greet
him
so
my
heart
went
out
to
him
but
the
sight
of
his
companion
restrained
me
and
i
sat
chuckling
and
wondering
in
my
corner
there
they
were
large
as
life
true
to
varvilliers
description
the
big
stomach
and
the
locket
that
a
hyperbole
so
inevitable
as
to
outstrip
mere
truth
in
fidelity
had
called
bigger
besides
there
were
the
whiskers
the
heavy
jowl
the
infinite
fatness
of
the
man
a
fatness
not
of
mere
flesh
only
but
of
manner
of
air
of
thought
of
soul
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
or
question
this
was
coralie
impresario
coralie
career
her
duty
her
destiny
in
a
word
everything
to
coralie
that
poor
little
cousin
elsa
was
to
me
nay
your
pardon
that
i
was
to
cousin
elsa
i
put
my
cigar
back
in
my
mouth
and
smoked
gravely
it
seemed
improper
to
laugh
the
two
men
sat
down
at
an
outer
table
wetter
was
silent
now
and
struboff
i
remembered
suddenly
that
i
had
seen
coralie
described
as
madame
was
talking
i
could
almost
see
the
words
treacling
from
his
thick
lips
what
in
heaven
name
made
him
companion
what
in
heaven
name
made
me
such
a
fool
as
to
ask
the
question
men
like
struboff
can
have
but
one
merit
and
to
be
fair
but
one
serious
crime
it
is
the
same
they
are
the
husbands
of
their
wives
i
could
contain
myself
no
longer
i
rose
and
walked
forward
i
laid
my
hand
on
wetter
shoulder
saying
my
dear
friend
have
you
forgotten
me
baron
de
neberhausen
illustration
my
dear
friend
have
you
forgotten
me
he
looked
up
with
a
start
but
when
he
saw
me
his
eyes
softened
he
clasped
my
hand
neberhausen
he
said
yes
we
met
in
forstadt
to
be
sure
he
laughed
may
i
present
my
friend
to
you
le
baron
de
neberhausen
struboff
you
will
know
struboff
name
he
gives
us
the
best
operas
in
the
world
and
the
best
singing
struboff
fame
has
reached
me
said
i
sitting
down
evidently
struboff
did
not
know
me
he
received
the
introduction
without
any
show
of
deference
i
was
delighted
i
should
have
seen
little
of
the
true
man
had
he
been
aware
from
the
first
who
i
was
things
being
as
they
were
i
could
flatter
him
and
he
had
no
motive
for
flattering
me
a
mere
baron
had
no
effect
on
him
he
resumed
the
interrupted
conversation
he
was
telling
wetter
how
he
could
make
money
out
of
music
and
then
more
music
out
of
the
money
then
more
money
out
of
the
music
and
so
on
in
an
endless
chain
of
music
and
money
money
and
music
money
music
money
wetter
sat
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
of
malicious
mockery
happy
man
he
cried
suddenly
you
love
only
two
things
in
the
world
and
you
married
both
struboff
pulled
his
whisker
meditatively
yes
i
have
done
well
he
said
and
drained
his
glass
but
coralie
done
well
too
where
would
she
have
been
but
for
me
indeed
my
dear
struboff
there
no
telling
but
i
suppose
in
the
arms
of
somebody
else
your
own
for
example
growled
the
husband
observe
the
usual
reticences
said
wetter
with
a
laugh
my
dear
baron
struboff
mocks
my
misery
by
a
pretended
jealousy
you
can
reassure
him
did
madame
mansoni
ever
favour
me
i
can
speak
only
of
what
i
know
i
answered
smiling
she
never
favoured
you
before
me
he
caught
the
ambiguity
of
my
words
and
laughed
again
struboff
turned
toward
me
with
a
stare
you
also
knew
my
wife
he
asked
i
had
the
honour
said
i
in
forstadt
in
forstadt
do
you
know
the
king
not
so
well
as
i
could
wish
i
answered
about
as
well
as
i
know
wetter
here
that
admirably
well
cried
wetter
well
enough
not
to
trust
me
the
fat
man
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
in
an
obtuse
suspicion
of
our
hilarity
the
king
admired
my
wife
talents
said
he
we
intend
to
visit
forstadt
next
year
do
you
said
i
and
wetter
peal
broke
out
again
the
king
will
find
my
wife
talent
much
increased
by
training
pursued
struboff
damn
your
wife
talent
said
wetter
quite
suddenly
you
talk
as
much
about
it
as
she
does
of
your
beauty
i
hope
madame
is
well
i
interposed
quickly
and
suavely
for
struboff
had
grown
very
red
and
gave
signs
of
temper
wetter
did
not
allow
him
to
answer
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
dragged
struboff
up
by
the
arm
take
his
other
arm
he
cried
to
me
bring
him
along
come
come
we
all
go
and
see
how
madame
is
it
nearly
eleven
remonstrated
struboff
sourly
i
want
to
go
to
bed
you
you
go
to
bed
you
with
your
crimes
go
to
bed
why
you
sleep
you
would
cower
all
night
go
to
bed
oh
my
dear
struboff
think
better
of
it
no
no
we
none
of
us
go
to
bed
bed
a
hell
for
men
like
us
for
you
above
all
think
again
struboff
think
again
struboff
shrugged
his
fat
shoulders
in
helpless
bad
temper
i
was
laughing
so
much
at
what
at
what
that
i
could
hardly
do
my
part
in
hustling
him
along
wetter
set
a
hot
pace
and
struboff
soon
began
to
pant
i
ca
walk
call
a
cab
he
gasped
cab
no
no
we
ca
sit
still
conscience
my
dear
struboff
you
know
there
nothing
like
walking
for
sinners
like
us
bring
him
along
baron
bring
him
along
perhaps
struboff
does
desire
our
company
i
suggested
perhaps
shouted
wetter
with
a
laugh
that
turned
a
dozen
heads
toward
him
oh
my
dear
struboff
do
you
hear
this
suggestion
of
our
friend
the
baron
what
a
pity
you
have
no
breath
to
repudiate
it
but
now
we
were
escaping
from
the
crowd
crossing
in
front
of
the
opera
house
we
made
for
the
rue
de
la
paix
the
pace
became
smarter
still
not
only
was
struboff
breathless
with
being
dragged
along
but
i
was
breathless
with
dragging
him
i
insisted
on
a
cab
wetter
yielded
planted
struboff
and
me
side
by
side
and
took
the
little
seat
facing
us
himself
here
he
sat
smiling
maliciously
as
the
poor
impresario
mopped
his
forehead
and
fetched
up
deep
gasps
of
breath
where
lay
the
inspiration
of
this
horseplay
of
wetter
quicker
quicker
he
cried
to
the
driver
i
am
impatient
my
friends
are
impatient
quick
quick
only
god
is
patient
he
mad
grunted
struboff
he
quite
mad
the
devil
i
hot
wetter
suddenly
assumed
an
air
of
great
dignity
and
blandness
in
offering
to
present
us
to
madame
at
an
hour
possibly
somewhat
late
he
said
our
dear
struboff
shows
his
wonted
amiability
we
should
be
failing
in
gratitude
if
we
did
not
thank
him
most
sincerely
i
did
ask
you
to
come
growled
struboff
wetter
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
grieved
surprise
but
said
nothing
at
all
he
turned
to
me
with
a
ridiculous
look
of
protest
as
though
asking
for
my
support
i
laughed
the
mad
nonsense
was
so
welcome
to
me
we
stopped
before
a
tall
house
in
the
rue
washington
wetter
bundled
us
out
with
immense
haste
there
were
lights
in
the
windows
madame
expects
us
he
cried
with
a
rapturous
clasping
of
his
hands
come
come
dear
struboff
baron
baron
pray
take
struboff
arm
the
steps
to
heaven
are
so
steep
struboff
seemed
resigned
to
his
fate
he
allowed
himself
to
be
pushed
upstairs
without
expostulation
he
opened
the
door
for
us
and
ushered
us
into
the
passage
as
he
preceded
us
i
had
time
for
one
whisper
to
wetter
you
still
mad
about
her
are
you
i
said
pinching
his
arm
still
good
heavens
no
again
he
answered
the
door
that
faced
us
was
thrown
open
and
coralie
stood
before
me
in
a
loose
gown
of
a
colour
before
she
could
speak
wetter
darted
forward
pulling
me
after
him
i
have
the
distinguished
honour
to
present
my
friend
de
neberhausen
he
said
you
may
remember
meeting
him
at
forstadt
coralie
looked
for
a
moment
at
each
of
us
in
turn
she
smiled
and
nodded
her
head
perfectly
she
said
but
it
is
a
surprise
to
see
him
here
a
very
pleasant
surprise
she
gave
me
her
hand
which
i
kissed
with
a
fine
flourish
of
gallantry
this
gentleman
knows
the
king
very
well
said
struboff
nodding
at
her
with
a
solemn
significance
there
money
in
that
he
seemed
to
say
does
he
she
asked
indifferently
and
added
to
me
pray
come
in
i
was
not
expecting
visitors
you
must
make
excuses
for
me
she
did
not
seem
changed
in
the
least
degree
there
was
the
same
indolence
the
same
languid
slow
enunciation
it
struck
me
in
a
moment
that
she
ignored
her
husband
presence
he
had
gone
to
a
sideboard
and
was
fingering
a
decanter
wetter
flung
himself
on
a
sofa
it
is
really
you
she
asked
in
a
whisper
with
a
lift
of
her
eyelids
oh
without
the
least
doubt
i
answered
and
it
is
you
also
struboff
came
forward
tumbler
in
hand
pray
is
your
king
fond
of
music
he
asked
he
will
adore
it
from
the
lips
of
madame
struboff
i
answered
bowing
he
adored
it
from
the
lips
of
mlle
mansoni
observed
wetter
with
a
malicious
smile
struboff
glared
at
him
coralie
smiled
slightly
an
inkling
of
wetter
chosen
part
came
into
my
mind
he
had
elected
to
make
struboff
uncomfortable
he
did
not
choose
that
the
fat
man
should
enjoy
his
victory
in
peace
my
emotions
chimed
in
with
his
resolve
but
reason
suggested
that
the
ethical
merits
were
more
on
struboff
side
he
was
coralie
career
the
analogy
of
my
own
relation
toward
elsa
urged
that
he
who
is
a
career
is
entitled
to
civility
was
not
i
struboff
i
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
it
passed
as
a
tribute
to
wetter
acid
correction
you
are
studying
here
in
paris
madame
i
asked
yes
said
coralie
why
else
should
we
be
here
now
why
else
should
i
be
here
now
asked
wetter
for
the
matter
of
that
baron
why
else
should
you
be
here
now
why
else
should
anybody
be
here
now
it
is
even
an
excuse
for
struboff
presence
i
need
no
excuse
for
being
in
my
own
home
said
struboff
and
he
gulped
down
his
liquor
wetter
sprang
up
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
you
are
becoming
fatter
and
fatter
and
fatter
presently
you
will
be
round
quite
round
they
make
a
drum
of
you
and
i
beat
you
in
the
orchestra
while
madame
sings
divinely
on
the
boards
come
and
see
if
we
can
possibly
avoid
this
thing
and
he
led
him
off
to
the
sofa
there
they
began
to
talk
wetter
suddenly
dropping
his
burlesque
and
allowing
a
quiet
earnest
manner
to
succeed
his
last
outburst
i
caught
some
mention
of
thousands
of
francs
surely
there
must
be
a
bond
of
interest
or
wetter
would
have
been
turned
out
before
now
coralie
moved
toward
the
other
end
of
the
room
which
was
long
although
narrow
i
followed
her
as
she
sat
down
she
remarked
he
has
lent
struboff
twenty
thousand
francs
but
for
that
i
must
have
sung
before
i
was
ready
the
situation
seemed
a
little
clearer
but
he
is
curious
she
pursued
fixing
a
patiently
speculative
eye
on
wetter
you
would
say
that
he
was
fond
of
me
it
is
a
possible
reason
for
his
presence
he
does
show
it
said
she
with
a
shrug
i
understood
that
little
point
in
wetter
code
besides
his
humour
seemed
just
now
too
bitter
for
if
coralie
felt
any
resentment
it
did
not
go
very
deep
she
turned
her
eyes
from
wetter
to
my
face
you
going
to
be
married
very
soon
she
said
in
a
month
said
i
i
having
my
last
fling
you
perceived
our
high
spirits
i
seen
her
picture
she
pretty
and
i
seen
the
countess
von
sempach
you
know
about
her
have
you
forgotten
that
you
used
to
speak
of
her
ah
yes
forgotten
all
that
you
used
to
say
the
countess
is
still
handsome
what
of
that
so
are
you
true
it
does
matter
much
coralie
admitted
does
your
princess
love
you
do
you
love
your
husband
a
faint
slow
smile
bent
her
lips
as
she
glanced
at
struboff
himself
and
his
locket
nobody
acts
without
a
motive
said
i
not
even
in
marrying
the
bitterness
that
found
expression
in
this
little
sneer
elicited
no
sympathetic
response
from
coralie
i
was
obliged
to
conclude
that
she
considered
her
marriage
a
success
at
least
that
it
was
doing
what
she
had
expected
from
it
at
this
moment
she
yawned
in
her
old
pretty
lazy
way
certainly
there
were
no
signs
of
romantic
misery
or
tragic
disillusionment
about
her
again
i
asked
myself
whether
my
sympathy
were
not
more
justly
due
to
struboff
struboff
who
sat
now
smoking
a
big
cigar
and
wobbling
his
head
solemnly
in
answer
to
the
emphatic
taps
of
wetter
forefinger
on
his
waistcoat
the
question
was
whether
human
tenderness
lay
anywhere
under
those
wrappings
if
so
struboff
might
be
a
proper
object
of
compassion
his
might
be
the
misery
his
o
monstrous
thought
the
disillusionment
but
the
prejudice
of
beauty
fought
hard
on
coralie
side
i
always
find
it
difficult
to
be
just
to
a
person
of
markedly
unpleasant
appearance
i
was
piqued
to
much
curiosity
by
these
wandering
ideas
i
determined
to
probe
struboff
through
the
layers
soon
after
i
took
my
leave
coralie
pressed
me
to
return
the
next
day
and
before
i
could
speak
wetter
accepted
the
invitation
for
me
there
was
no
very
strong
repugnance
in
struboff
face
i
should
not
have
heeded
it
had
it
appeared
wetter
prepared
to
come
with
me
i
watched
his
farewell
to
coralie
his
smile
seemed
to
mock
both
her
and
himself
she
was
weary
and
dreary
but
probably
only
because
she
wanted
her
bed
it
was
a
mistake
as
a
rule
to
attribute
to
her
other
than
the
simplest
desires
the
moment
we
were
outside
wetter
turned
on
me
with
a
savagely
mirthful
expression
of
my
own
thoughts
a
wretched
thing
to
leave
her
with
him
not
the
least
in
the
world
he
cried
she
will
sleep
ten
hours
eat
one
sing
three
sleep
three
eat
two
sleep
have
i
run
through
the
well
then
why
are
we
to
disturb
ourselves
i
asked
why
are
we
to
disturb
ourselves
good
god
is
it
enough
that
she
should
be
like
that
i
laughed
as
i
blew
out
my
cigarette
smoke
this
is
an
old
story
said
i
she
is
not
in
love
with
you
i
suppose
that
it
is
it
it
not
the
absence
of
the
fact
said
he
with
a
smile
it
the
want
of
the
potentiality
that
is
so
deplorable
why
torment
struboff
though
struboff
he
repeated
knitting
his
brows
ah
now
struboff
is
worth
tormenting
you
wo
believe
me
but
he
can
feel
i
was
right
then
i
thought
he
could
you
saw
it
my
prospects
perhaps
quicken
my
wits
my
arm
was
through
his
and
he
pressed
it
between
his
elbow
and
his
side
you
see
said
he
perversity
runs
through
it
all
she
should
feel
he
should
not
it
seems
she
does
but
he
does
heavens
would
you
accept
such
a
conclusion
without
the
fullest
experiment
for
me
i
am
determined
to
test
it
still
you
in
love
with
her
agreed
agreed
agreed
a
man
must
have
a
spur
to
knowledge
we
parted
at
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
i
strolled
on
alone
to
my
hotel
vohrenlorf
was
waiting
for
me
a
little
anxious
infinitely
sleepy
i
dismissed
him
at
once
and
sat
down
to
read
my
letters
i
had
the
feeling
that
i
would
think
about
all
these
matters
but
i
was
also
pervaded
by
a
satisfaction
my
mind
was
being
fed
the
air
here
nourished
the
air
of
artenberg
starved
i
complimented
paris
on
a
virtue
not
her
own
the
house
in
the
rue
washington
was
the
source
of
my
satisfaction
there
was
a
letter
from
varvilliers
he
wrote
from
hungary
where
he
was
on
a
visit
here
is
something
of
what
he
said
there
is
a
charming
lady
here
and
we
fall
in
love
all
according
to
mode
and
fashion
the
buttons
are
on
the
foils
pray
understand
it
is
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
the
whole
process
might
as
i
believe
be
digested
into
twelve
elementary
motions
or
thereabouts
the
information
is
given
and
received
by
code
it
is
like
playing
whist
much
have
you
her
eyes
ask
passion
i
answer
by
the
code
have
a
comes
from
her
side
of
the
table
am
leading
up
to
it
say
i
am
returning
the
lead
good
but
then
comes
hers
or
mine
have
no
more
alas
well
then
i
lead
or
she
leads
another
suit
it
a
good
game
and
our
stakes
are
not
high
you
sire
would
like
signals
harder
to
read
i
know
your
taste
you
right
there
and
do
you
make
the
stakes
higher
i
have
plunged
into
indiscretion
if
i
did
not
you
would
think
that
bederhof
had
forged
my
handwriting
unless
i
am
stopped
on
the
frontier
i
shall
be
in
forstadt
in
three
weeks
i
dropped
the
letter
with
a
laugh
wondering
whether
the
charming
lady
played
the
game
as
he
did
and
a
stake
as
light
or
did
she
suffer
well
anybody
can
suffer
the
talent
is
almost
universal
there
was
it
seemed
reason
to
suppose
that
struboff
suffered
i
acquiesced
but
with
a
sense
of
discontent
pain
should
not
be
vulgarized
immunity
gave
him
a
new
distinction
in
my
eyes
chapter
xxiv
what
a
question
struboff
inevitable
discovery
of
my
real
name
was
a
disaster
it
delayed
my
operations
for
three
days
since
it
filled
his
whole
being
with
a
sense
of
abasement
and
a
hope
of
gain
thereby
suspending
for
the
time
those
emotions
in
him
which
had
excited
my
curiosity
clearly
he
had
unstinted
visions
of
lucrative
patronage
dreams
probably
of
a
piece
of
coloured
ribbon
for
his
and
a
right
to
try
to
induce
people
to
call
him
chevalier
he
made
coralie
a
present
handsome
enough
i
respected
the
conscientiousness
of
this
act
my
friendship
was
an
profit
a
bonus
on
the
marriage
and
he
gave
his
wife
her
commission
but
he
seemed
cased
in
steel
against
any
confidence
he
trembled
as
he
poured
me
out
a
glass
of
wine
he
had
pictured
me
only
as
a
desirable
appendage
to
a
gala
performance
it
is
of
course
difficult
to
realize
that
the
points
at
which
people
are
important
to
us
are
not
those
at
which
they
are
important
to
themselves
however
i
made
progress
at
last
the
poor
man
was
a
sad
case
the
sadder
because
only
with
constant
effort
could
the
onlooker
keep
its
sadness
disengaged
from
its
absurdity
and
remember
that
unattractiveness
does
not
exclude
misery
the
wife
in
a
marriage
of
interest
is
the
spoiled
child
of
romancers
scarcely
any
is
rude
enough
to
say
well
who
put
you
there
the
husband
in
such
a
partnership
gains
less
attention
at
the
most
he
is
allowed
a
subordinate
share
of
the
common
stock
of
woe
the
clean
case
for
observation
he
miserable
she
miles
away
from
any
such
poignancy
of
emotion
was
presented
by
coralie
consistency
it
was
not
in
her
to
make
a
bargain
and
pull
grimaces
when
she
was
asked
to
fulfil
it
true
she
interpreted
it
in
her
own
way
i
promised
to
marry
you
well
i
have
how
are
you
wronged
but
did
i
promise
to
speak
to
you
to
like
you
dieu
who
promised
or
would
ever
promise
to
love
you
the
mingled
impatience
and
amusement
of
such
questions
expressed
themselves
in
her
neglect
of
him
and
in
her
yawns
under
his
locket
and
his
paunch
and
his
layers
he
burned
with
pain
wetter
was
laying
the
blisters
open
to
the
air
that
their
sting
might
be
sharper
at
last
sorely
beset
he
divined
a
sympathy
in
me
he
thought
it
disinterested
not
perceiving
that
he
had
for
me
the
fascination
of
a
travesty
of
myself
and
that
in
his
marriage
i
enjoyed
a
burlesque
presentiment
of
what
mine
would
be
that
point
of
view
was
my
secret
until
quick
wit
penetrated
it
he
worked
days
before
he
found
out
why
i
was
drawn
to
the
impresario
his
discovery
was
hailed
with
a
sudden
laugh
and
a
glance
but
he
put
nothing
into
words
both
to
him
and
to
me
the
thing
was
richer
for
reticence
in
the
old
phrase
the
drapery
enhanced
the
charms
which
it
did
not
hide
a
day
came
when
i
asked
the
husband
to
luncheon
with
me
i
sent
vohrenlorf
away
we
sat
down
together
struboff
swelling
with
pride
seeing
himself
telling
the
story
in
the
wings
meditating
the
appearance
and
multiplication
of
paragraphs
i
said
not
a
word
to
discourage
the
visions
we
talked
of
how
coralie
should
make
fame
and
he
money
he
grew
enthusiastic
guttural
and
severe
on
the
steinberg
i
ordered
more
steinberg
and
fished
for
more
enthusiasm
i
put
my
purse
at
his
disposal
he
dipped
his
fingers
deep
with
an
anxious
furtive
eagerness
the
loan
was
made
or
at
least
pledged
before
it
flashed
across
my
brain
that
the
money
was
destined
for
wetter
he
wanted
to
pay
off
wetter
we
were
nearing
the
desired
ground
my
dear
struboff
said
i
you
must
not
allow
yourself
to
be
embarrassed
great
properties
are
slow
to
develop
but
i
have
patience
with
my
investments
clear
yourself
of
all
claims
money
troubles
fritter
away
a
man
brains
and
you
want
yours
he
muttered
something
about
temporary
scarcity
it
would
be
intolerable
that
madame
should
be
bothered
with
such
matters
i
said
he
gulped
down
his
steinberg
and
gave
a
snort
the
sound
was
eloquent
although
not
sweet
i
filled
his
glass
and
handed
him
a
cigar
he
drank
the
wine
but
laid
the
cigar
on
the
table
and
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
and
women
like
to
have
money
about
i
pursued
looking
at
the
veins
on
his
forehead
i
squandered
money
on
her
he
said
good
money
yes
yes
one
love
seeks
every
mode
of
expression
i
sure
grateful
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
i
was
smoking
composedly
were
you
once
in
love
with
my
wife
he
asked
bluntly
his
deference
wore
away
under
the
corrosion
of
steinberg
and
distress
let
us
choose
our
words
my
dear
struboff
once
i
professed
attachment
to
mlle
mansoni
she
loved
you
it
is
discourteous
not
to
accept
any
impression
that
a
lady
wishes
to
convey
to
you
i
answered
smiling
ah
you
know
her
he
cried
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
assured
him
her
beauty
her
charm
her
genius
yes
we
all
know
those
but
her
soul
that
her
prerogative
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
during
which
he
still
looked
at
me
his
thick
eyelids
half
hiding
the
pathetic
gaze
of
his
little
eyes
my
life
a
hell
he
said
and
laid
his
head
between
his
hands
on
the
table
i
saw
a
shudder
in
his
fat
shoulders
my
dear
struboff
i
murmured
as
i
rose
and
walked
round
to
him
i
did
not
like
touching
him
but
i
forced
myself
to
pat
his
shoulder
kindly
women
take
whims
and
fancies
said
i
as
i
walked
back
to
my
seat
he
raised
his
head
and
set
his
chin
between
his
fists
she
took
me
for
what
she
could
get
out
of
me
said
he
shall
we
be
just
did
you
look
to
get
something
out
of
her
yes
i
married
her
for
that
he
answered
but
i
a
damned
fool
i
saw
that
she
loathed
me
it
is
hard
to
see
you
see
it
everybody
sees
it
and
you
fell
in
love
with
her
that
was
breaking
the
bargain
it
it
crossed
my
mind
that
i
might
possibly
break
my
bargain
with
elsa
but
the
peril
was
remote
my
god
it
maddening
to
be
treated
like
a
beast
am
i
repulsive
am
i
loathsome
what
a
question
my
dear
m
struboff
and
i
live
with
her
it
is
for
all
day
and
every
day
come
come
be
reasonable
we
not
lovesick
boys
if
i
touch
a
piece
of
bread
in
giving
it
to
her
she
cuts
herself
another
slice
how
i
understood
you
in
that
o
dainty
cruel
coralie
and
that
devil
comes
and
laughs
at
me
he
need
come
if
you
do
wish
it
perhaps
it
better
than
being
alone
with
her
he
groaned
and
she
does
deceive
me
ah
i
should
like
sometimes
to
say
to
her
what
you
like
amuse
yourself
i
shall
not
see
it
would
matter
if
she
did
that
she
might
be
so
hard
to
me
you
wonder
that
i
say
this
that
i
feel
it
like
this
well
i
a
man
i
not
a
dog
i
do
dirty
people
when
i
touch
them
i
got
up
and
walked
to
the
hearthrug
i
stood
there
with
my
back
to
him
he
blew
his
nose
loudly
then
took
the
bottle
i
heard
the
wine
trickle
in
the
glass
and
the
sound
of
his
noisy
swallowing
there
was
a
long
silence
he
struck
a
match
and
lit
his
cigar
then
he
folded
up
the
notes
i
had
given
him
and
the
clasp
of
his
clicked
i
have
to
go
with
her
to
rehearsal
he
said
i
turned
round
and
walked
toward
him
his
uneasy
deference
returned
he
jumped
up
with
a
bow
and
an
air
of
awkward
embarrassment
your
majesty
is
very
good
your
majesty
pardons
me
i
have
abused
your
majesty
kindness
you
understand
i
have
nobody
to
speak
to
i
understand
very
well
struboff
i
am
very
sorry
be
kind
to
her
and
she
will
change
toward
you
he
shook
his
head
ponderously
she
wo
change
he
said
and
stood
shuffling
his
feet
as
he
waited
to
be
dismissed
i
gave
him
my
hand
o
coralie
you
and
your
bread
i
understood
she
get
accustomed
to
you
i
murmured
with
a
reminiscence
of
william
adolphus
i
think
she
hates
me
more
every
day
he
bowed
over
my
hand
and
backed
out
with
clumsy
ceremony
i
flung
myself
on
the
sofa
was
not
the
burlesque
well
conceived
and
deftly
fashioned
true
i
did
not
seem
to
myself
much
like
struboff
there
was
no
comfort
in
that
struboff
did
not
seem
to
himself
much
like
what
he
was
am
i
repulsive
am
i
loathsome
he
cried
indignantly
and
my
diplomacy
could
answer
only
what
a
question
my
dear
m
struboff
if
i
cried
out
asking
whether
i
were
so
unattractive
that
my
bride
must
shrink
from
me
a
thousand
shocked
voices
would
answer
in
like
manner
oh
sire
what
a
question
later
in
the
day
i
called
on
coralie
and
found
her
alone
speaking
as
though
from
my
own
observation
i
taxed
her
roundly
with
her
coldness
to
struboff
and
with
allowing
him
to
perceive
her
distaste
for
him
i
instanced
the
matter
of
the
bread
declaring
that
i
had
noticed
it
when
i
breakfasted
with
them
coralie
began
to
laugh
do
i
do
that
well
perhaps
i
do
you
felt
his
hand
it
is
not
very
pleasant
yes
i
think
i
do
take
another
piece
he
observes
it
oh
i
think
not
he
does
care
besides
he
must
know
have
i
pretended
to
care
for
him
heavens
i
no
hypocrite
we
knew
very
well
what
we
wanted
he
and
i
we
have
each
got
it
but
kisses
were
in
the
bargain
and
you
kiss
nobody
now
no
she
answered
simply
and
without
offence
no
wetter
does
ask
me
and
you
know
i
never
felt
love
for
him
if
he
did
ask
me
i
would
these
things
are
very
troublesome
and
you
do
ask
me
no
i
do
coralie
said
i
smiling
i
might
kiss
you
perhaps
i
have
something
to
give
too
have
i
no
that
would
be
no
use
i
should
make
nothing
out
of
you
and
the
rest
is
nonsense
no
i
would
kiss
you
if
you
did
ask
perhaps
wetter
will
ask
you
now
i
have
lent
your
husband
money
and
he
will
pay
wetter
off
ah
perhaps
he
will
then
he
is
curious
wetter
but
i
sha
kiss
him
i
am
very
well
as
i
am
happy
yes
at
least
i
should
be
if
it
were
not
for
struboff
he
annoys
me
very
much
you
know
it
like
an
ugly
picture
in
the
room
or
a
dog
one
hates
he
does
say
or
do
much
but
he
there
always
it
frets
me
madame
my
sympathy
is
extreme
oh
your
sympathy
you
laughing
at
me
i
do
care
you
going
to
be
married
yourself
what
you
imply
is
not
very
reassuring
it
all
a
question
of
what
one
expects
she
said
with
a
shrug
my
wife
wo
mind
me
touching
her
bread
i
asked
anxiously
oh
no
she
wo
mind
that
you
not
like
that
oh
no
it
wo
be
in
that
way
i
declare
i
much
comforted
indeed
you
need
fear
that
in
some
things
all
women
are
alike
you
need
fear
anything
of
that
sort
no
woman
could
feel
that
about
you
i
grow
happier
every
moment
i
should
have
liked
elsa
to
cut
herself
another
slice
coralie
laughed
sniffed
the
roses
i
had
brought
and
laughed
again
as
she
said
in
fact
i
do
i
remember
it
now
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
it
came
natural
to
do
it
as
if
the
piece
had
fallen
on
the
floor
you
know
evidently
struboff
had
analyzed
his
wife
feelings
very
correctly
i
doubted
both
the
use
and
the
possibility
of
enlightening
her
as
to
his
kisses
were
not
in
the
bargain
she
would
say
after
all
the
desire
for
affection
was
something
of
an
incongruity
in
struboff
an
alien
weed
trespassing
on
the
ground
meant
for
music
and
for
money
i
could
hardly
blame
her
for
refusing
to
foster
the
intruder
i
felt
that
i
should
be
highly
unjust
if
later
on
i
laid
any
blame
on
elsa
for
not
satisfying
a
desire
for
affection
should
i
chance
to
feel
such
a
thing
and
as
to
the
bread
coralie
had
quite
reassured
me
i
looked
at
her
she
was
smiling
in
quiet
amusement
evidently
her
fancy
was
tickled
by
the
matter
of
the
bread
you
notice
a
thing
like
that
she
said
but
he
does
imagine
his
noticing
it
i
can
imagine
it
very
well
oh
no
impossible
he
has
no
sensibility
you
laugh
well
yes
perhaps
it
lucky
during
the
next
two
or
three
days
i
was
engaged
almost
unintermittently
with
business
which
followed
me
from
home
and
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
more
of
my
friends
i
regretted
this
the
less
because
i
seemed
now
to
be
possessed
of
the
state
of
affairs
i
resigned
myself
to
the
necessity
of
a
speedy
return
to
forstadt
already
bederhof
was
in
despair
at
my
absence
and
excuses
failed
me
i
could
not
tell
him
that
to
return
to
forstadt
was
to
begin
the
preparations
for
execution
a
point
at
which
hesitation
must
be
forgiven
in
the
condemned
but
before
i
went
i
had
a
talk
with
wetter
he
stormed
vohrenlorf
defences
and
burst
into
my
room
late
one
night
so
we
going
back
sire
he
cried
back
to
our
work
back
to
harness
you
going
too
i
asked
quietly
he
threw
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
yes
i
too
he
said
struboff
has
paid
me
off
i
have
played
i
have
won
i
am
rich
i
desire
to
serve
my
country
you
do
appear
pleased
sire
when
you
serve
your
country
i
have
to
set
about
saving
mine
said
i
dryly
oh
you
be
glad
of
the
distraction
of
public
affairs
he
sneered
madame
has
not
fulfilled
my
hopes
of
her
i
thought
you
have
no
leisure
for
politics
for
a
long
while
to
come
the
pupil
of
hammerfeldt
speaks
to
me
he
said
with
a
smile
you
would
be
right
very
likely
but
for
the
fact
that
madame
has
dismissed
me
you
use
a
conventional
phrase
well
then
she
has
well
yes
i
do
use
a
conventional
phrase
i
shall
congratulate
struboff
on
an
increased
tranquillity
the
evening
was
chilly
and
i
had
a
bit
of
fire
wetter
sat
looking
into
it
hugging
his
knees
and
swaying
his
body
to
and
fro
i
stood
on
the
hearthrug
by
him
i
have
still
time
he
said
suddenly
i
a
young
man
i
can
do
something
still
you
can
turn
me
out
you
think
i
do
want
to
turn
you
out
use
me
perhaps
tame
you
perhaps
i
looked
down
at
him
and
i
laughed
why
do
you
laugh
he
asked
i
thought
i
should
have
roused
that
sleeping
dignity
of
yours
oh
my
friend
said
i
you
will
not
tame
me
and
you
will
not
do
great
things
why
not
he
asked
briefly
and
brusquely
you
play
again
you
do
some
mad
prank
some
other
woman
will
let
us
stick
to
our
phrase
will
not
dismiss
you
when
an
irresistible
force
encounters
an
immovable
object
you
know
the
old
puzzle
interpret
your
parable
o
king
when
a
great
brain
is
joined
to
an
impossible
temper
result
the
result
is
nothing
said
he
taking
a
fresh
grip
of
his
knees
even
so
even
so
i
nodded
but
i
have
done
things
he
persisted
yes
and
then
undone
them
my
friend
you
a
tragedy
and
i
lit
a
cigarette
he
sat
where
he
was
for
a
moment
longer
then
he
sprang
up
with
a
loud
laugh
a
tragedy
a
tragedy
if
i
make
one
by
heaven
the
world
is
rich
in
them
take
struboff
for
another
but
your
majesty
is
wrong
i
a
farce
yes
you
a
bit
of
a
farce
said
i
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
and
looked
full
and
long
in
my
face
so
you
made
your
study
of
us
he
asked
oh
i
know
why
you
came
to
paris
coralie
struboff
myself
you
have
us
all
now
pretty
well
said
i
to
understand
people
is
both
useful
and
interesting
and
to
a
man
in
my
position
it
has
the
further
attraction
of
being
difficult
and
you
think
bederhof
is
too
strong
for
me
he
is
stupid
and
respectable
my
dear
wetter
what
chance
have
you
there
a
river
in
this
town
shall
i
jump
in
heavens
no
you
set
it
all
and
sire
i
thought
of
killing
struboff
ah
yes
the
pleasures
of
imagination
i
often
indulge
in
them
then
a
bullet
for
myself
of
course
and
another
impresario
for
coralie
you
must
look
ahead
in
such
matters
it
would
have
made
a
great
sensation
everywhere
except
in
the
bosom
of
coralie
your
cleverness
robbed
the
world
of
that
other
sensation
long
ago
if
i
had
killed
you
it
would
have
been
another
another
impresario
for
my
princess
we
shall
meet
at
forstadt
you
ask
me
to
the
wedding
unless
you
have
incurred
princess
heinrich
anger
i
tell
you
i
going
to
settle
down
never
said
i
be
careful
sire
the
revolver
i
bought
for
struboff
is
in
my
pocket
make
me
a
present
of
it
i
suggested
he
looked
hard
in
my
eyes
laughed
a
little
drew
out
a
small
revolver
and
handed
it
to
me
struboff
was
never
in
great
danger
he
said
i
was
never
much
afraid
for
struboff
said
i
thanks
for
the
revolver
you
not
quibbling
with
me
i
do
understand
there
no
river
in
this
town
no
institution
called
the
morgue
not
a
trace
of
such
things
do
you
know
why
not
because
it
the
king
pleasure
said
i
smiling
and
holding
out
my
hand
to
him
because
i
a
friend
to
a
friend
he
said
as
he
took
my
hand
then
without
another
word
he
turned
and
walked
out
quickly
i
heard
him
speak
to
vohrenlorf
in
the
outer
room
and
laugh
loudly
as
he
ran
down
the
stairs
he
had
reminded
me
that
i
was
a
pupil
of
hammerfeldt
the
reminder
came
home
to
me
as
a
reproach
i
had
been
forgetful
of
the
lessons
i
had
allowed
myself
to
fall
into
a
habit
of
thought
which
led
me
to
assume
that
my
happiness
or
unhappiness
was
a
relevant
consideration
in
judging
of
the
merits
of
the
universe
the
assumption
is
so
common
as
to
make
us
forget
that
so
far
from
being
proved
it
is
not
even
plausible
i
saw
the
absurdity
of
it
at
once
in
the
light
of
my
recent
discoveries
was
god
shamed
because
struboff
was
miserable
because
coralie
was
serenely
selfish
because
wetter
was
tempestuous
beyond
rescue
i
smiled
at
all
these
questions
and
proceeded
to
the
inference
that
the
exquisite
satisfaction
of
my
own
cravings
was
probably
not
an
inherent
part
of
the
divine
purpose
that
is
if
there
were
such
a
thing
and
if
there
were
not
the
whole
matter
was
so
purely
accidental
as
not
to
admit
of
any
one
consideration
being
in
the
least
degree
more
or
less
relevant
than
another
willingly
give
thyself
up
to
clotho
allowing
her
to
spin
thy
thread
into
whatever
things
she
pleases
that
was
an
extremely
good
maxim
but
it
would
have
been
of
no
service
to
cast
the
pearl
before
coralie
impresario
i
would
use
it
myself
though
i
summoned
vohrenlorf
we
have
stayed
here
too
long
vohrenlorf
said
i
my
presence
is
necessary
in
forstadt
i
must
not
appear
wanting
in
interest
in
these
preparations
undoubtedly
said
he
they
are
very
anxious
for
your
return
and
i
am
very
anxious
to
return
we
go
by
the
evening
train
send
word
to
bederhof
he
seemed
rather
surprised
and
not
very
pleased
but
promised
to
see
that
my
orders
were
executed
i
sat
down
in
the
chair
in
which
wetter
had
sat
and
began
again
to
console
myself
with
my
stoic
maxim
but
there
was
a
point
at
which
i
stuck
i
recalled
coralie
and
her
bread
and
regarded
struboff
not
in
the
aspect
of
his
own
misery
which
i
had
decided
to
be
irrelevant
but
in
the
light
of
coralie
feelings
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
philosopher
should
have
spared
more
consideration
to
this
side
of
the
matter
had
he
reached
such
heights
as
to
be
indifferent
not
only
to
his
own
sufferings
but
to
being
a
cause
of
suffering
to
others
perhaps
marcus
aurelius
had
attained
to
this
coralie
mansoni
by
the
way
seemed
most
blessedly
to
have
been
born
into
it
to
me
it
was
a
stone
of
stumbling
pride
came
to
me
with
insidious
aid
and
admired
while
i
talked
of
clotho
but
where
was
my
ally
when
i
pictured
elsa
also
making
her
surrender
to
the
fates
my
ally
then
became
my
enemy
with
a
violent
wrench
i
brought
myself
to
the
thought
that
neither
was
elsa
happiness
a
relevant
consideration
it
would
not
do
i
could
not
maintain
the
position
for
elsa
was
young
fresh
aspiring
to
happiness
as
a
plant
rears
its
head
to
the
air
and
our
wedding
was
but
a
fortnight
off
am
i
repulsive
am
i
loathsome
what
a
question
my
dear
m
struboff
i
had
that
snatch
of
talk
in
my
head
when
i
fell
asleep
the
next
day
but
one
found
me
back
at
forstadt
they
had
begun
to
decorate
the
streets
chapter
xxv
a
smack
of
repetition
the
contrast
of
outer
and
inner
of
the
world
myself
and
my
own
myself
of
others
as
they
seem
to
me
and
to
themselves
of
the
reality
they
may
be
through
inattention
or
dulness
as
ignorant
as
i
which
is
the
most
permanent
and
the
dominant
impression
that
life
has
stamped
on
my
mind
was
never
more
powerfully
brought
home
to
me
than
in
the
days
which
preceded
my
marriage
to
my
cousin
elsa
as
i
have
said
they
had
begun
to
decorate
the
streets
let
me
summarize
all
the
rest
by
repeating
that
they
decorated
the
streets
and
went
on
decorating
them
the
decorative
atmosphere
enveloped
all
external
objects
and
wrapped
even
the
members
of
my
own
family
in
its
spangled
cloud
victoria
blossomed
in
diamonds
william
adolphus
sprouted
in
plumes
my
mother
embodied
the
stately
cousin
elizabeth
a
gorgeous
heartiness
the
eyes
wore
a
bored
look
but
the
remainder
of
his
person
was
fittingly
resplendent
bederhof
was
bumble
in
olympus
beyond
these
came
a
sea
of
smiles
bows
silks
and
uniforms
really
i
believe
that
the
whole
thing
was
done
as
handsomely
as
possible
and
the
proceedings
are
duly
recorded
in
a
book
of
red
leather
clasped
in
gold
and
embellished
with
many
pictures
which
the
municipality
of
forstadt
presented
to
elsa
in
remembrance
of
the
auspicious
event
it
lies
now
under
a
glass
case
and
i
understand
excites
much
interest
among
ladies
who
come
to
see
my
house
elsa
was
a
puzzle
no
longer
i
should
have
welcomed
more
complexity
of
feeling
the
month
which
had
passed
since
we
parted
had
brought
to
her
many
reflections
no
doubt
and
as
a
presumable
result
of
them
a
fixed
attitude
of
mind
william
adolphus
would
have
said
and
very
likely
did
say
to
victoria
that
she
had
got
used
to
me
but
this
mode
of
putting
the
matter
suffers
from
my
bluntness
she
had
not
defied
clotho
but
neither
had
she
altogether
given
herself
up
to
clotho
she
had
compromised
with
the
formidable
lady
and
although
by
no
means
enraptured
seemed
to
be
conscious
that
she
might
have
come
off
worse
what
was
distasteful
in
clotho
terms
elsa
attempted
to
reduce
to
insignificance
by
a
disciplined
arrangement
of
her
thoughts
and
emotions
much
can
be
done
if
one
will
be
firm
with
vagrants
of
the
mind
the
pleasant
may
be
given
prominence
the
disagreeable
relegated
to
obscurity
the
attractive
installed
in
the
living
apartments
the
repellant
locked
in
a
distant
cellar
whence
their
cries
are
audible
occasionally
only
and
in
the
distance
what
might
have
been
is
sternly
transformed
from
a
beautiful
vision
into
a
revolting
peril
and
in
this
new
shape
is
invoked
to
applaud
the
actual
and
vilify
what
is
impossible
this
attitude
of
mind
is
thought
so
commendable
as
to
have
won
for
itself
in
popular
speech
the
name
of
philosophy
so
even
with
words
clotho
works
her
will
elsa
then
in
this
peculiar
sense
of
the
term
was
philosophical
about
the
business
she
was
balanced
in
her
attitude
and
left
to
herself
would
maintain
equilibrium
she
growing
fonder
and
fonder
of
you
every
day
cousin
elizabeth
whispered
in
my
ear
i
hope
said
i
with
a
reminiscence
that
i
am
not
absolutely
repulsive
to
her
and
in
order
not
to
puzzle
cousin
elizabeth
with
any
glimmer
of
truth
i
smiled
my
dearest
augustin
that
she
seemed
to
say
struboff
was
a
childish
trick
of
my
imagination
what
an
idea
what
a
question
my
dear
m
struboff
i
played
too
much
perhaps
with
my
parallel
but
i
was
not
its
slave
i
knew
myself
to
be
unlike
struboff
in
my
case
coralie
scouted
the
idea
of
a
fresh
slice
of
bread
i
knew
elsa
to
be
of
very
different
temperament
from
coralie
these
variances
did
not
invalidate
the
family
likeness
a
son
may
be
very
like
his
father
though
the
nose
of
one
turns
up
and
the
other
nose
turns
down
we
were
after
making
all
allowances
for
superficial
differences
we
were
both
careers
struboff
and
i
need
none
to
point
out
to
me
my
blunder
none
to
say
that
i
was
really
fortunate
and
cried
for
the
moon
it
is
admitted
i
was
offered
a
charming
friendship
it
was
not
enough
i
could
give
a
tender
friendship
i
knew
that
it
was
not
enough
and
there
was
that
other
thing
which
went
to
my
heart
that
possibility
which
must
ever
be
denied
realization
that
beginning
doomed
to
be
thwarted
as
we
were
talking
once
of
all
who
were
to
come
on
the
great
day
i
saw
suddenly
a
little
flush
on
elsa
cheek
she
did
not
look
away
or
stammer
or
make
any
other
obvious
concession
to
her
embarrassment
but
the
blush
could
not
be
denied
access
to
her
face
and
came
eloquent
with
its
hint
and
de
varvilliers
he
will
be
there
i
suppose
she
asked
i
hope
so
i
have
given
directions
that
he
shall
be
invited
you
like
him
elsa
yes
she
said
not
looking
at
me
now
but
straight
in
front
of
her
as
though
he
stood
there
in
his
easy
grace
and
for
an
instant
longer
the
flush
flew
his
flag
on
her
cheek
but
struboff
had
been
so
mad
as
to
fall
in
love
with
coralie
and
to
desire
her
love
out
of
no
compassion
for
her
but
sheerly
for
itself
was
i
not
spared
this
pang
i
do
not
know
whether
my
state
were
worse
or
better
for
with
him
even
in
direst
misery
there
would
be
love
own
mad
hope
that
denial
of
impossibility
that
dream
of
marvellous
change
which
shoots
across
the
darkest
gloom
of
passion
or
at
least
he
could
imagine
her
loving
as
he
loved
and
thereby
cheat
the
wretched
thing
that
was
i
could
not
in
dreary
truth
i
was
toward
her
as
she
toward
me
and
before
us
both
there
stretched
a
lifetime
if
an
added
sting
were
needed
i
found
it
in
a
perfectly
clear
consciousness
that
a
great
many
people
would
have
been
absolutely
content
and
as
onlookers
of
our
case
would
have
wondered
what
all
the
trouble
was
about
there
are
those
who
from
a
fortunate
want
of
perception
are
called
sensible
just
as
elsa
by
her
resolute
evasion
of
truth
would
be
accorded
the
title
of
philosophical
victoria
was
the
prophet
of
the
actual
picking
out
with
optimistic
eye
its
singular
abundance
of
blessedness
i
do
not
think
that
she
reminded
me
that
elsa
might
have
had
but
one
eye
one
leg
or
a
crooked
back
but
her
felicitations
ran
on
this
strain
their
obvious
artificiality
gave
them
the
effect
of
sympathy
and
victoria
would
always
sanction
this
interpretation
by
a
kiss
on
departure
but
she
had
her
theory
it
was
that
elsa
only
needed
to
be
wooed
the
only
amused
me
but
even
with
that
point
waived
i
questioned
her
position
it
left
out
imagination
and
it
left
out
varvilliers
who
had
become
pet
nevertheless
victoria
spoke
out
of
experience
she
did
not
blush
at
declaring
herself
after
all
very
comfortable
with
william
adolphus
granted
the
argument
sincerity
its
force
could
not
be
denied
with
honesty
we
not
romantic
and
never
have
been
of
course
she
conceded
my
dear
victoria
of
course
not
said
i
laughing
openly
we
have
had
our
quarrels
the
quarrels
would
trouble
me
in
the
least
we
do
expect
too
much
of
one
another
i
seem
to
be
listening
to
the
address
on
the
wedding
day
you
an
exasperating
creature
and
with
that
came
the
kiss
victoria
affection
was
always
grateful
to
me
but
in
the
absence
of
wetter
and
varvilliers
neither
of
whom
had
made
any
sign
as
yet
i
was
bereft
of
all
intellectual
sympathy
i
had
looked
to
find
some
in
the
duke
and
some
as
i
believe
there
was
but
its
flow
was
checked
and
turned
by
what
i
must
call
a
repressed
resentment
his
wife
blind
heartiness
was
impossible
to
him
and
he
read
with
a
clear
eye
the
mind
of
a
loved
daughter
with
him
also
i
ranked
as
a
necessity
so
far
as
the
necessity
was
distasteful
to
elsa
it
was
unpalatable
to
him
beneath
his
friendliness
and
side
by
side
with
an
unhesitating
acceptance
of
the
position
there
lay
this
grudge
not
acknowledged
bound
to
incur
instant
absurdity
as
the
price
of
any
open
assertion
of
itself
but
set
in
his
mind
and
affecting
his
disposition
toward
me
he
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
blame
me
but
i
was
to
him
the
occasion
of
certain
fears
and
shrinkings
possibly
of
some
qualms
as
to
his
own
part
in
the
matter
and
thus
i
became
a
less
desired
companion
there
was
something
between
us
a
subject
always
present
never
to
be
mentioned
as
a
result
there
came
constraint
my
pride
took
alarm
and
my
polite
distance
answered
in
suitable
terms
to
his
reticent
courtesy
i
believe
however
that
we
found
one
common
point
in
a
ludicrous
horror
of
cousin
elizabeth
behaviour
had
she
assumed
the
air
she
wore
she
must
have
ranked
as
a
diplomatist
having
succeeded
in
the
great
task
of
convincing
herself
she
stands
above
those
who
can
boast
only
of
deceiving
others
to
cousin
elizabeth
the
alliance
was
a
love
match
had
she
possessed
the
other
qualities
her
would
have
been
enough
to
enable
her
to
found
a
religious
sect
and
believe
that
she
was
sent
from
heaven
for
its
prophet
amid
this
group
of
faces
all
turned
toward
the
same
object
but
with
expressions
subtly
various
i
spent
my
days
studying
them
all
and
finding
here
has
been
nature
consolation
to
me
relief
from
my
own
thoughts
in
an
investigation
of
the
mind
of
others
the
portentous
pretence
on
which
we
were
engaged
needed
perhaps
a
god
to
laugh
at
it
but
the
smaller
points
were
within
the
sphere
of
human
ridicule
with
them
there
was
no
danger
of
amusement
suffering
a
sudden
death
and
a
swift
resurrection
in
the
changed
shape
of
indignation
there
was
already
much
to
laugh
at
but
now
a
new
occasion
came
taking
its
rise
in
a
thing
which
seemed
very
distinct
and
appertaining
to
moods
and
feelings
long
gone
by
a
plaything
of
memory
destined
as
it
had
appeared
to
play
no
more
part
in
actual
life
the
matter
was
simply
this
count
max
von
sempach
was
on
leave
and
proposed
with
my
permission
to
be
in
forstadt
for
the
wedding
festivities
bederhof
had
heard
legendary
tales
his
manner
was
dubious
and
solemn
as
he
submitted
the
count
proposal
to
me
princess
carelessness
of
reference
would
have
stirred
suspicion
in
the
most
guileless
heart
william
adolphus
broke
into
winks
and
threatened
nudges
i
invoked
my
dignity
just
in
time
victoria
was
rather
excited
rather
pleased
looking
forward
to
an
amusing
spectacle
evidently
something
had
reached
cousin
elizabeth
ears
for
she
overflowed
with
unspoken
assurances
that
the
news
was
of
absolutely
no
importance
that
she
took
no
notice
of
boyish
follies
and
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
my
devotion
to
elsa
elsa
herself
betrayed
consciousness
only
by
not
catching
my
eye
when
the
sempachs
coming
cropped
up
in
conversation
for
my
own
part
i
said
that
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
the
count
and
the
countess
and
that
they
had
a
clear
claim
to
their
invitation
my
mother
manner
had
shown
that
she
felt
herself
in
no
position
to
raise
objections
bederhof
took
my
commands
with
resigned
deference
i
was
aware
that
his
wife
had
ceased
to
call
on
the
countess
some
time
before
count
max
went
ambassador
to
paris
max
had
done
his
work
very
well
his
appointment
has
been
quoted
as
an
instance
of
my
precocious
insight
into
character
and
his
work
did
not
appear
to
have
done
him
any
harm
when
he
called
on
me
i
found
him
the
same
sincere
simple
fellow
that
he
had
been
always
by
consent
we
talked
of
private
affairs
rather
than
of
business
he
told
me
that
tot√©
was
growing
into
a
tall
girl
that
his
other
children
also
shot
up
but
he
added
proudly
his
wife
did
not
look
a
day
older
and
her
appearance
had
if
anything
improved
she
had
been
happy
at
paris
he
said
but
to
be
sure
she
be
happy
anywhere
with
the
children
and
her
home
the
modesty
of
the
last
words
did
not
conceal
his
joyous
confidence
i
felt
very
kindly
toward
him
really
you
an
encouragement
to
me
at
this
moment
i
said
you
must
take
me
to
see
the
countess
she
will
be
most
honoured
sire
i
much
rather
she
be
a
little
pleased
he
laughed
in
evident
gratification
assuring
me
that
she
would
be
very
pleased
he
answered
for
her
emotions
in
the
true
style
of
the
blessed
partner
that
is
an
incident
of
matrimony
which
i
am
content
to
have
escaped
i
doubted
very
much
whether
she
were
so
eager
for
the
renewal
of
my
acquaintance
as
he
declared
i
recollected
the
doubts
and
fears
that
had
beset
her
vision
of
that
event
long
ago
but
my
part
was
plain
to
go
and
to
go
speedily
to
the
countess
exclaimed
victoria
to
whom
i
mentioned
casually
my
plans
for
the
afternoon
you
in
a
great
hurry
augustin
it
no
sign
of
hurry
to
go
to
a
place
at
the
right
time
said
i
with
a
smile
i
do
call
it
quite
proper
i
go
because
it
is
proper
if
you
flirt
with
her
again
my
dear
victoria
what
things
you
suggest
victoria
returned
to
her
point
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
rush
off
there
all
in
a
minute
she
persisted
nevertheless
i
went
paying
the
tribute
of
a
laugh
to
the
picture
of
victoria
flying
with
the
news
to
princess
heinrich
but
the
eye
could
tell
a
real
danger
from
an
imaginary
one
she
would
not
mind
my
seeing
the
countess
now
i
went
quite
privately
without
notice
and
was
not
expected
thus
it
happened
that
i
was
ushered
into
the
when
the
countess
was
not
there
to
receive
me
there
i
found
tot√©
undeniably
and
regrettably
shy
the
world
had
begun
to
set
its
mark
on
her
and
she
had
discovered
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
behave
to
me
i
was
sorry
not
to
be
pleasant
company
for
tot√©
but
perceiving
the
fact
too
plainly
to
resist
it
i
sent
her
off
to
hasten
her
mother
she
had
not
been
gone
a
moment
before
the
countess
came
in
hurriedly
with
apologies
on
her
lips
not
a
day
older
o
my
dear
max
shall
we
pray
for
this
blindness
or
shall
we
not
she
was
older
than
she
had
been
older
than
by
now
she
should
be
yet
her
charm
hung
round
her
like
a
fine
stuff
that
defies
time
and
a
gentle
kindness
graced
her
manner
we
began
to
talk
about
anything
and
nothing
she
showed
fretful
dread
of
a
pause
when
she
spoke
she
did
not
look
me
in
the
face
i
could
not
avoid
the
idea
that
she
did
not
want
me
and
would
gladly
see
me
take
my
leave
but
such
a
feeling
was
as
it
seemed
to
me
inhuman
a
falseness
to
our
true
selves
born
of
some
convention
or
of
a
scruple
overstrained
or
of
a
fear
not
warranted
have
you
seen
elsa
i
asked
presently
and
perhaps
rather
abruptly
yes
she
said
i
was
presented
to
her
she
was
very
sweet
and
kind
to
me
she
that
to
me
too
i
said
rising
and
standing
by
her
chair
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
looked
up
at
me
i
saw
emotion
in
her
eyes
you
be
happy
with
her
she
asked
if
she
is
very
unhappy
i
daresay
i
sha
be
ah
she
said
with
a
sort
of
despairing
sigh
but
i
do
suppose
i
should
make
anybody
particularly
happy
yes
yes
she
cried
in
impetuosity
yes
if
she
stopped
fear
was
in
her
eyes
now
and
she
scanned
my
face
with
a
close
jealous
intensity
i
knew
what
her
fear
was
her
own
expression
of
it
echoed
back
across
the
years
she
feared
that
she
had
given
me
occasion
to
laugh
at
her
i
bent
down
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
lightly
perhaps
had
all
the
world
been
different
said
i
with
a
smile
i
terribly
changed
no
not
terribly
and
not
much
how
has
it
been
with
you
her
nervousness
seemed
to
be
passing
off
she
answered
me
in
a
sincere
simplicity
that
would
neither
exaggerate
nor
hide
all
that
is
good
short
of
the
best
she
said
and
with
you
shall
i
say
all
that
is
bad
short
of
the
worst
we
should
mean
very
different
things
no
not
very
i
done
many
foolish
things
have
you
they
all
say
that
you
fill
your
place
well
i
have
paid
high
to
do
it
what
you
thought
high
when
you
paid
she
said
smiling
sadly
i
would
not
do
her
the
wrong
of
any
pretence
she
was
entitled
to
my
honesty
i
still
think
it
high
i
said
but
not
too
high
nothing
is
too
high
but
others
must
help
to
pay
my
score
you
know
that
yes
i
know
it
and
this
girl
will
know
it
she
would
have
it
otherwise
i
know
i
know
i
know
she
would
not
it
strange
to
have
you
here
now
max
would
come
i
did
wish
it
yet
she
smiled
for
a
moment
and
added
yet
in
a
way
i
did
wish
it
i
was
drawn
here
it
seemed
to
concern
me
do
laugh
it
seemed
to
be
part
of
my
story
too
i
felt
that
i
must
be
there
to
hear
it
are
you
laughing
i
never
laughed
you
good
and
kind
and
generous
no
i
think
you
have
i
glad
of
it
because
yes
why
because
even
now
i
ca
she
whispered
no
do
think
i
mean
i
mean
a
thing
which
would
oblige
you
to
laugh
now
it
all
over
all
over
but
that
it
should
have
been
augustin
my
name
slipped
from
unconscious
lips
that
it
should
have
been
is
bad
to
me
it
good
that
wicked
i
ca
help
it
it
the
thing
the
thing
of
my
life
i
no
place
like
yours
i
nothing
to
make
it
come
second
ah
forgetting
again
how
old
i
am
how
you
always
make
me
forget
it
i
must
talk
like
this
we
shall
never
i
suppose
talk
like
this
again
you
go
back
to
paris
yes
soon
i
glad
but
it
not
hard
to
you
now
she
seemed
to
reflect
as
though
she
were
anxious
to
give
me
an
answer
accurately
true
not
very
hard
now
she
said
at
last
looking
full
at
me
not
very
hard
but
very
constant
always
with
me
i
love
them
all
all
my
folk
but
it
always
there
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
the
thought
of
me
yes
or
the
thought
that
somehow
i
have
just
missed
i
not
miserable
and
i
like
to
dream
to
be
gorgeous
splendid
wicked
in
dreams
she
gave
a
laugh
and
pressed
my
hand
for
a
moment
tot√©
grows
pretty
she
said
do
you
think
so
tot√©
was
unhappy
with
me
and
i
let
her
go
yes
she
pretty
she
wo
be
like
you
though
i
appeal
to
you
again
in
five
in
ten
years
said
she
smiling
pleased
with
my
covert
praise
oh
it
pleasant
to
see
you
again
she
went
on
a
moment
later
i
a
bad
penitent
i
wish
i
could
be
with
you
always
no
i
am
not
dreaming
now
i
mean
just
in
forstadt
and
seeing
you
a
moment
ago
you
were
glad
to
go
back
to
paris
ah
you
assume
more
ignorance
of
us
than
you
have
may
i
be
glad
of
one
thing
and
wish
another
true
and
men
can
do
that
too
i
felt
the
old
charm
of
the
quick
word
coming
from
the
beautiful
lips
the
twofold
appeal
though
passion
was
gone
pleasure
in
her
remained
my
love
was
dead
as
i
sat
there
i
wished
it
alive
again
i
longed
to
be
back
in
the
storm
of
it
even
though
i
must
battle
the
storm
again
after
all
she
said
with
a
glance
at
me
i
have
my
share
in
you
you
ca
think
of
your
life
without
thinking
of
me
i
something
to
you
i
one
among
the
many
foolish
things
you
do
hate
the
foolish
things
on
my
soul
i
believe
not
one
of
them
and
if
you
one
i
love
one
of
them
i
like
you
to
say
that
a
long
silence
fell
on
us
the
thing
had
not
come
in
either
of
the
fashions
in
which
i
had
pictured
it
neither
in
weariness
nor
in
excitement
it
came
full
with
emotions
but
emotions
that
were
subdued
shadows
of
themselves
of
a
mournful
sweetness
bewailing
their
lost
strength
yet
shrinking
from
remembrance
of
it
would
we
have
gone
back
if
we
could
now
i
could
not
answer
the
question
yet
we
could
weep
because
to
go
back
was
impossible
but
it
was
with
a
slight
laugh
that
at
last
i
rose
to
my
feet
to
say
it
like
you
always
to
laugh
at
the
end
she
said
a
little
in
reproach
but
more
i
think
in
the
pleasure
of
recognising
what
was
part
of
her
idea
of
me
you
used
often
to
do
it
even
when
you
were
even
before
you
remember
the
first
time
of
all
when
we
smiled
at
one
another
behind
your
mother
back
that
oldest
memory
comforts
me
do
you
know
why
i
was
never
so
many
centuries
older
than
you
again
not
so
many
even
now
you
look
old
i
think
and
seem
old
if
nearer
together
it
your
fault
not
my
merit
well
you
must
go
ah
how
you
fill
time
how
you
could
have
filled
a
woman
life
could
have
your
mood
is
right
surely
she
be
happy
with
you
if
you
could
love
her
not
even
then
i
not
to
her
measure
are
you
unhappy
it
better
than
the
worst
a
great
deal
better
i
pressed
her
hand
and
kissed
it
with
a
sudden
seeming
formality
she
curtseyed
and
kissed
mine
i
do
forget
what
you
are
she
said
because
i
have
fancied
you
as
something
besides
sire
augustin
there
a
name
wanting
ah
to
c√¶sar
i
said
five
years
ago
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
as
i
turned
away
and
left
her
i
had
a
fancy
to
walk
back
alone
as
i
had
walked
alone
from
her
house
on
the
day
when
i
cut
the
bond
between
us
that
same
five
years
ago
having
dismissed
my
carriage
i
set
out
in
the
cool
of
the
autumn
evening
as
dusk
had
just
fallen
and
took
my
way
through
the
decorated
streets
only
three
days
more
lay
between
the
decorations
and
the
occasion
they
were
meant
to
grace
there
was
a
hum
of
gaiety
through
all
the
town
they
had
begun
their
and
the
shops
did
splendid
trade
they
in
forstadt
would
have
liked
to
marry
me
every
year
why
not
i
was
to
them
a
sign
a
symbol
something
they
saw
and
spoke
of
but
not
a
man
i
reviewed
the
troops
every
year
why
should
i
not
be
married
every
year
it
would
be
but
the
smallest
extension
of
my
functions
and
all
on
the
lines
of
logic
i
could
imagine
princess
heinrich
according
amplest
approval
to
the
scheme
suddenly
as
i
passed
in
meditation
through
a
quiet
street
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
shoulder
i
knew
only
one
man
who
would
stop
me
in
that
way
was
he
here
again
risen
again
in
forstadt
again
for
work
or
mirth
or
mischief
he
came
in
fitting
with
the
visit
i
had
paid
i
turned
and
found
his
odd
wry
smile
on
me
the
knit
brows
and
twinkling
eyes
he
lifted
his
hat
and
tossed
back
the
hair
i
am
come
to
the
wedding
sire
said
he
bowing
it
would
be
incomplete
without
you
wetter
and
for
another
thing
for
a
treat
for
a
spectacle
they
written
an
epithalamium
have
they
yes
some
fool
according
to
his
folly
it
is
to
be
sung
at
the
opera
the
night
before
at
the
gala
performance
you
as
well
up
in
the
arrangements
as
bederhof
himself
i
have
cause
whence
come
you
sire
from
paying
a
visit
to
the
countess
von
sempach
he
burst
into
a
laugh
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
forbade
me
to
be
offended
that
very
whimsical
too
he
observed
there
a
smack
of
repetition
about
this
is
fate
for
new
effects
there
variety
enough
here
for
me
there
were
no
decorations
in
the
streets
when
i
left
her
before
true
true
and
for
i
must
return
to
my
tidings
i
bring
you
something
new
he
paused
and
enjoyed
his
smile
at
me
who
sings
the
marriage
song
he
asked
heavens
man
i
do
know
i
not
the
manager
what
is
it
to
me
who
sings
the
song
you
would
like
it
sung
in
tune
oh
unquestionably
ah
well
she
sings
in
tune
he
said
nodding
his
head
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
she
is
not
emotional
but
she
sings
in
tune
does
she
wetter
who
is
she
he
stood
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
then
broke
into
another
laugh
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
now
i
laughed
myself
no
no
i
cried
fate
does
joke
wetter
fate
jokes
said
he
it
is
coralie
who
will
sing
your
song
they
reach
here
she
and
struboff
yes
sire
coralie
is
to
sing
your
song
we
stood
looking
at
one
another
we
both
were
laughing
it
a
great
chance
in
her
career
he
said
it
rather
a
curious
chance
in
mine
said
i
she
sings
it
she
sings
it
he
cried
and
with
a
last
laugh
turned
and
fairly
ran
away
down
the
street
like
a
mischievous
boy
who
has
thrown
his
squib
and
flies
from
the
scene
in
mirthful
fear
when
fortune
jested
she
found
in
him
quickwitted
loving
audience
chapter
xxvi
the
secret
of
the
countess
princess
heinrich
held
a
reception
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
those
in
forstadt
who
were
receivable
so
comprehensive
was
the
party
that
to
be
included
conveyed
no
compliment
to
be
left
out
meant
a
slap
in
the
face
but
the
scene
was
gorgeous
and
the
princess
presided
over
it
with
fitting
dignity
elsa
and
i
stood
by
her
for
a
while
all
in
our
buckram
living
monuments
of
bliss
and
exaltedness
it
was
like
a
prolonged
interview
with
the
photographer
then
i
slipped
away
and
paid
marked
and
honorific
courtesy
to
bederhof
wife
and
daughters
tall
girls
not
to
be
married
somehow
quite
inevitable
if
one
considered
bederhof
himself
rising
from
my
plunge
i
looked
round
for
elsa
she
had
left
my
mother
and
taken
a
seat
in
a
recess
by
the
window
there
she
sat
looking
poor
soul
rather
weary
speaking
now
and
then
to
those
who
in
passing
by
paused
to
make
their
respects
and
compliments
to
her
she
wore
my
diamonds
all
eyes
were
for
her
the
streets
were
splendidly
decorated
was
she
content
with
all
my
heart
i
hoped
that
she
was
people
came
and
buzzed
about
me
and
i
buzzed
back
to
them
i
had
learned
to
buzz
i
believe
with
some
grace
and
facility
certainly
with
an
almost
entire
detachment
of
my
inner
mind
it
would
be
intolerable
for
the
real
man
to
be
engrossed
in
such
performances
looking
over
the
head
of
the
president
of
the
court
of
appeal
he
was
much
shorter
than
his
speeches
i
saw
elsa
suddenly
lean
forward
and
sign
with
her
fan
to
a
lady
who
passed
by
the
lady
stopped
she
sat
down
by
elsa
they
entered
into
conversation
for
a
while
i
went
on
buzzing
and
being
buzzed
to
but
presently
curiosity
conquered
me
in
the
pleasure
of
your
conversation
i
must
forget
what
is
my
first
duty
just
now
gentlemen
i
said
with
a
smile
they
dissolved
from
in
front
of
me
with
discreet
smiles
i
sauntered
toward
the
recess
where
elsa
sat
glancing
at
princess
heinrich
i
saw
her
watching
all
that
went
forward
but
she
was
hemmed
in
by
eminent
persons
and
why
should
she
interpose
if
elsa
desired
to
talk
to
the
countess
von
sempach
i
leaned
over
the
arm
of
my
betrothed
chair
they
were
talking
of
common
affairs
from
where
i
was
i
could
not
see
elsa
face
so
i
moved
and
stood
leaning
on
a
third
chair
between
them
the
countess
was
gay
and
brilliant
kind
also
with
a
tenderness
that
seemed
to
throw
out
feelers
for
friendship
to
me
she
spoke
only
when
i
addressed
her
directly
her
attention
was
all
for
elsa
in
elsa
eyes
not
skilled
to
conceal
her
heart
there
was
overpowering
all
other
expression
a
curiosity
a
study
of
something
that
interested
and
puzzled
her
a
desire
to
understand
the
woman
who
talked
to
her
for
elsa
had
heard
something
not
all
but
something
she
was
not
hostile
or
disturbed
she
was
gracious
and
eager
to
please
but
she
was
inquiring
and
searching
at
her
heart
bidding
her
wits
were
on
the
move
i
knew
the
maze
that
they
explored
she
was
asking
for
the
countess
secret
but
which
secret
for
to
her
it
might
well
seem
that
there
were
two
rumour
said
that
i
had
loved
the
countess
it
would
be
in
the
way
of
the
natural
woman
for
elsa
to
desire
to
find
out
why
the
trick
of
the
charm
that
a
predecessor
let
the
word
pass
had
wielded
but
rumour
said
also
that
the
countess
had
loved
me
was
this
the
deeper
harder
secret
that
elsa
sought
to
probe
this
the
puzzle
to
which
she
asked
an
answer
perhaps
could
she
find
an
answer
that
satisfied
there
would
be
new
heaven
and
new
earth
for
her
here
seemed
to
me
the
truth
the
reason
of
the
longing
question
in
her
eyes
jealousy
could
not
inspire
that
certainly
not
a
jealousy
of
what
was
long
gone
by
of
a
woman
who
to
elsa
fresh
girlhood
must
be
faded
and
almost
sunk
to
middle
age
how
did
you
contrive
to
love
him
that
was
elsa
question
asked
beneath
my
understanding
gaze
there
was
a
little
stir
by
the
door
and
a
man
came
through
the
group
that
loitered
round
it
hastily
shaking
hands
here
nodding
there
as
he
steered
his
course
toward
princess
heinrich
i
knew
that
varvilliers
would
come
to
the
wedding
but
had
not
been
aware
that
he
was
already
in
forstadt
my
companions
did
not
notice
him
but
i
watched
his
interview
with
my
mother
even
she
unbent
to
him
disarmed
by
a
courtesy
that
overcame
the
protest
of
her
judgment
she
detained
him
in
conversation
nearly
ten
minutes
and
then
pointed
to
where
we
were
directing
him
to
join
us
ah
here
comes
varvilliers
said
i
i
delighted
to
have
him
back
you
met
him
countess
oh
yes
sire
in
paris
she
answered
for
a
few
moments
i
kept
my
eyes
from
elsa
face
and
looked
toward
varvilliers
smiling
and
beckoning
when
i
turned
toward
her
she
was
bright
and
composed
he
joined
us
and
she
welcomed
him
with
cordiality
he
launched
on
an
account
of
his
doings
then
came
to
our
affairs
commiserating
us
on
the
trial
of
our
ceremonies
for
a
while
we
talked
all
to
all
then
i
began
to
tell
the
countess
a
little
story
varvilliers
and
elsa
fell
into
a
conversation
apart
she
had
made
him
sit
by
her
i
bent
down
over
my
chair
back
to
converse
more
easily
with
my
countess
all
this
was
right
enough
unless
the
talk
were
to
continue
general
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
went
on
thus
some
time
i
know
it
was
at
last
it
chanced
that
the
countess
made
no
answer
to
what
i
said
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
a
thoughtful
smile
i
sighed
raised
my
head
and
looked
across
the
room
i
heard
the
other
two
in
animated
talk
and
their
gay
laughter
for
the
moment
my
mind
was
not
on
them
suddenly
wetter
passed
in
front
of
me
he
had
once
been
president
of
the
chamber
and
princess
heinrich
knew
her
duty
he
was
with
william
adolphus
who
seemed
in
extremely
good
spirits
wetter
paused
opposite
to
me
and
bowed
i
returned
his
salutation
but
did
not
invite
him
to
join
us
i
hoped
to
speak
to
him
later
thus
it
was
for
a
bare
instant
that
he
halted
but
what
matters
time
its
only
true
measure
lies
in
what
a
man
does
in
it
wetter
momentary
halt
was
long
enough
for
one
of
those
glances
of
his
to
play
over
the
group
we
made
from
face
to
face
it
ran
a
change
of
expression
marking
every
stage
it
rested
at
last
on
me
i
turned
my
head
sharply
toward
elsa
her
cheek
was
flushed
her
eyes
glistened
her
body
was
bent
forward
in
an
eagerness
of
attention
as
though
she
would
not
lose
a
word
varvilliers
was
given
over
to
the
spirit
of
his
talk
but
he
watched
the
sparks
that
he
struck
from
her
eyes
i
glanced
again
at
wetter
william
adolphus
had
seized
his
arm
and
urged
him
forward
for
a
second
still
he
stood
he
tossed
his
hair
back
laughed
and
turned
away
why
should
he
stay
he
had
said
all
that
the
situation
suggested
to
him
and
said
it
with
his
own
merciless
lucidity
i
echoed
his
laugh
mine
was
an
interruption
to
their
talk
elsa
started
and
looked
up
varvilliers
face
turned
to
me
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
then
a
strange
and
most
unusual
air
of
embarrassment
spread
over
him
the
countess
did
not
speak
and
her
eyes
were
downcast
varvilliers
was
himself
again
directly
he
began
to
speak
of
indifferent
matters
he
was
not
so
awkward
as
to
let
this
incident
be
the
occasion
of
his
a
minute
or
two
passed
i
looked
at
him
and
held
out
my
hand
at
the
same
instant
the
countess
asked
a
signal
from
elsa
and
it
was
given
we
all
stood
together
for
a
moment
then
they
left
us
she
accepting
his
arm
to
cross
the
room
elsa
sat
down
again
and
did
not
speak
i
found
no
words
either
but
leaned
again
over
my
chair
regarding
the
scene
in
absent
moodiness
i
was
thinking
how
odd
a
thing
it
was
and
how
perfect
that
absolute
contentment
of
the
one
with
the
other
that
mutual
sufficiency
that
fitting
in
of
each
to
each
that
ultimate
oneness
of
soul
which
is
the
block
from
which
is
hewn
image
and
the
block
is
there
though
by
fate
caprice
it
lie
unshaped
the
thing
had
been
between
the
countess
and
myself
its
virtue
had
availed
to
abolish
difference
of
years
to
rout
absurdity
to
threaten
the
strongest
resolution
of
my
mind
it
was
between
elsa
and
varvilliers
in
none
other
had
i
found
it
for
myself
in
none
other
would
elsa
find
it
it
was
not
for
her
in
me
then
in
vain
had
been
the
questioning
of
her
eyes
in
vain
the
eager
longing
of
her
parted
lips
she
had
not
ears
to
hear
the
secret
of
the
countess
at
this
moment
i
forgot
again
that
my
or
even
her
happiness
was
not
a
relevant
consideration
in
forming
a
judgment
of
the
universe
it
is
in
fact
a
difficult
thing
to
remember
my
pride
was
ablaze
with
hatred
of
being
taken
because
i
could
not
be
refused
i
was
carried
away
by
a
sudden
impulse
i
threw
myself
into
the
chair
by
elsa
saying
how
it
would
surprise
and
scatter
all
these
good
people
if
you
suddenly
announced
that
you
changed
your
mind
elsa
what
a
rout
what
a
scurry
what
a
putting
out
of
lights
and
a
pulling
down
of
poles
and
a
furling
up
of
flags
and
a
countermanding
of
orders
to
the
butcher
and
the
baker
good
heavens
think
of
my
mother
face
or
indeed
of
your
mother
face
think
of
bederhof
face
of
everybody
face
and
i
fell
to
laughing
elsa
also
laughed
but
with
a
nervous
discomfort
her
glance
at
me
was
short
her
eyes
dropped
again
what
made
you
think
of
such
a
thing
she
asked
in
a
hesitating
tone
i
do
know
said
i
then
i
turned
and
asked
have
you
never
thought
of
it
never
she
said
indeed
never
how
could
i
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
her
disclaimer
she
seemed
really
shocked
and
amazed
at
the
notion
and
now
to
do
it
now
when
everything
is
ready
she
gave
a
pretty
little
gasp
and
go
back
with
mother
to
bartenstein
she
went
on
shaking
her
head
in
horror
how
could
you
imagine
it
fancy
bartenstein
again
evidently
i
was
preferable
to
bartenstein
again
to
the
narrow
humdrum
life
there
no
poles
no
flags
no
illuminations
no
cheers
no
dignity
diamonds
even
scarce
and
rare
i
tried
to
take
heart
it
was
something
to
be
better
than
bartenstein
again
and
what
would
they
think
of
me
oh
it
too
absurd
but
of
course
you
were
joking
oh
not
more
than
usual
elsa
you
might
have
found
me
even
more
tiresome
than
bartenstein
nonsense
it
would
always
be
better
here
than
at
bartenstein
clearly
there
was
no
question
in
her
mind
on
this
point
forstadt
and
i
let
me
share
since
i
may
not
engross
the
credit
were
much
better
than
going
back
to
bartenstein
she
was
looking
at
me
with
an
uneasy
almost
suspicious
air
what
made
you
ask
that
question
she
said
abruptly
i
looked
round
the
room
among
the
many
groups
in
talk
there
were
faces
turned
toward
us
regarding
us
with
a
discreet
amusement
the
king
forgot
his
duties
and
talked
with
his
every
moment
buttressed
the
reputation
of
our
love
match
let
it
be
so
it
was
best
yet
the
sham
was
curiously
unpleasant
to
me
why
did
you
ask
me
that
question
augustin
you
had
a
reason
no
none
except
that
in
hours
it
will
be
too
late
to
ask
it
she
leaned
toward
me
in
agitated
pleading
i
do
love
you
augustin
i
love
nobody
so
much
as
you
you
and
father
i
and
father
poor
girl
how
she
admitted
while
she
thought
to
deny
but
i
was
full
of
a
pity
and
a
tenderness
for
her
and
forgot
my
own
pride
you
so
good
to
me
and
there
no
reason
why
you
should
like
me
like
said
i
a
gentleman
must
pretend
sometimes
or
so
thought
yes
what
do
you
mean
pleased
coquetry
gleamed
for
a
moment
in
her
eyes
do
you
mean
love
me
it
is
impossible
is
it
i
asked
and
i
looked
into
her
eyes
as
though
i
desired
her
love
well
i
did
that
she
might
have
peace
she
blushed
and
suddenly
as
it
were
by
an
uncontrollable
immediate
impulse
glanced
round
whose
face
did
she
seek
was
it
not
his
who
last
had
looked
at
her
in
that
fashion
he
was
not
in
sight
her
gaze
fell
downward
ah
that
you
had
been
a
better
diplomatist
elsa
for
though
a
man
may
know
the
truth
he
loves
sometimes
one
who
will
deny
it
to
him
pleasantly
he
gains
thereby
a
respite
and
an
intermission
the
convict
repose
between
his
turns
on
the
treadmill
or
the
flouting
of
hard
life
that
good
wine
brings
but
it
was
impossible
to
rear
on
stable
foundations
a
pleasure
house
of
pretence
with
every
honest
revelation
of
her
heart
elsa
shattered
it
i
can
not
blame
her
i
myself
was
at
my
analytic
undermining
you
go
on
then
i
asked
with
a
laugh
she
laughed
for
answer
the
question
seemed
to
her
to
need
no
answer
what
would
she
go
back
to
bartenstein
to
insignificance
to
dulness
and
to
tutelage
surely
not
but
i
not
very
like
the
grenadier
i
said
she
understood
me
and
flushed
relapsing
into
uneasiness
i
saw
that
i
had
touched
some
chord
in
her
and
i
would
willingly
have
had
my
words
unsaid
presently
she
turned
to
me
and
forgetting
the
gazers
round
held
out
her
hands
to
mine
her
eyes
seemed
dim
i
try
i
try
to
make
you
happy
she
said
illustration
i
try
i
try
to
make
you
happy
and
she
said
well
letting
all
think
what
they
would
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
bowed
low
over
the
hand
that
i
kissed
then
i
gave
her
my
arm
and
walked
with
her
through
the
lane
that
they
made
for
us
surely
we
pretended
well
for
somehow
from
somewhere
a
cheer
arose
and
they
cheered
us
as
we
walked
through
elsa
face
was
in
an
instant
bright
again
she
pressed
my
arm
in
a
spasm
of
pleasure
we
proceeded
in
triumph
to
where
princess
heinrich
sat
away
behind
her
in
the
foremost
row
of
a
group
of
men
stood
wetter
wetter
leading
the
cheers
waving
his
handkerchief
grinning
in
charmingly
diabolical
fashion
the
suitability
of
princess
heinrich
reception
of
us
i
must
leave
to
be
imagined
it
was
among
her
triumphs
i
fell
at
once
into
the
clutches
of
cousin
elizabeth
my
regard
for
whom
was
tempered
by
a
preference
for
more
restraint
in
the
display
of
emotion
my
dearest
boy
she
said
pulling
me
into
a
seat
by
her
i
saw
you
it
makes
me
so
happy
a
thing
without
being
exactly
good
in
itself
may
of
course
have
incidental
advantages
it
was
sure
to
happen
you
were
made
for
one
another
dear
elsa
is
young
and
shy
and
and
she
did
quite
understand
cousin
elizabeth
looked
almost
sly
but
now
the
weight
is
quite
off
my
mind
because
elsa
does
change
does
she
i
asked
no
she
constancy
itself
once
she
takes
up
a
point
of
view
you
know
or
an
impression
of
a
person
nothing
alters
it
dear
me
we
used
to
think
her
obstinate
only
everybody
gave
way
to
her
that
was
her
father
fault
he
never
would
have
her
thwarted
but
she
turned
out
very
well
has
she
so
i
ca
blame
him
i
know
your
mother
thought
us
rather
lax
ah
my
mother
was
not
lax
it
only
shows
there
room
for
both
ways
does
it
what
was
i
saying
i
knew
what
she
had
been
saying
but
not
which
part
of
it
she
desired
to
repeat
however
she
found
it
for
herself
in
a
moment
oh
yes
no
she
never
changes
just
what
she
is
to
you
now
she
be
all
her
life
i
never
knew
her
to
change
she
just
loves
you
or
she
does
and
there
it
rests
you
may
feel
quite
safe
how
very
satisfactory
all
this
is
cousin
elizabeth
satisfactory
she
exclaimed
with
a
momentary
surprise
at
my
epithet
but
her
theory
came
to
the
rescue
oh
i
know
you
always
talk
like
that
well
i
do
expect
you
to
talk
like
a
lover
to
me
it
quite
enough
if
you
do
it
to
elsa
yes
it
is
satisfactory
is
it
the
good
creature
laughed
heartily
and
squeezed
my
hand
she
never
change
she
repeated
once
again
in
an
ample
comfortable
contentment
and
you
do
mind
showing
what
you
feel
do
you
cousin
elizabeth
was
chaffing
me
on
my
word
i
forgot
how
public
we
were
said
i
my
feelings
ran
away
with
me
oh
why
should
you
be
ashamed
they
might
laugh
but
i
sure
they
envied
you
it
was
strange
enough
but
it
is
very
likely
that
they
did
for
my
own
part
i
have
learned
not
to
envy
people
without
knowing
a
good
deal
about
them
and
their
affairs
because
pursued
cousin
elizabeth
i
have
always
in
my
heart
hated
merely
arranged
marriages
they
not
right
you
know
augustin
they
may
be
necessary
but
they
not
right
very
necessary
but
quite
wrong
i
agreed
and
at
one
time
i
was
the
least
bit
afraid
however
i
was
a
silly
old
woman
do
look
at
her
talking
to
your
mother
oh
of
course
you
were
looking
at
her
already
you
were
listening
to
my
chatter
but
i
had
listened
to
cousin
elizabeth
chatter
she
had
told
me
something
of
interest
elsa
would
never
change
she
took
a
view
and
a
relation
toward
a
person
and
maintained
them
what
she
was
to
me
now
she
would
be
always
my
dear
cousin
i
have
listened
with
keen
interest
to
every
word
that
you
said
i
protested
truthfully
that
your
politeness
i
know
what
lovers
are
said
cousin
elizabeth
i
looked
across
to
the
duke
passive
tired
face
the
thought
crossed
my
mind
that
cousin
elizabeth
must
have
depended
on
observation
rather
than
on
experience
for
the
impressions
to
which
she
referred
however
she
afforded
me
an
opportunity
for
escape
which
i
embraced
with
alacrity
as
i
passed
my
mother
she
beckoned
to
me
elsa
had
left
her
and
she
was
alone
for
the
moment
it
seemed
that
she
had
a
word
to
say
to
me
and
on
the
subject
concerning
which
i
thought
it
likely
enough
that
she
would
have
something
to
say
the
engagement
of
coralie
to
sing
at
the
gala
performance
was
there
not
some
unpleasant
talk
about
this
madame
mansoni
she
asked
well
there
was
talk
said
i
smiling
and
allowing
my
eyes
to
rest
on
the
figure
of
william
adolphus
visible
in
the
distance
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
have
her
perhaps
it
can
be
altered
i
suppose
bederhof
sanctioned
it
without
referring
to
you
or
to
me
it
has
become
public
now
oh
i
did
know
that
yes
it
in
the
evening
papers
any
any
remarks
no
except
that
the
vorw√§rts
calls
it
an
extraordinarily
suitable
selection
the
vorw√§rts
yes
said
i
thoughtfully
wetter
wrote
for
the
vorw√§rts
perhaps
then
to
cancel
it
would
make
more
talk
than
to
let
it
stand
the
whole
story
is
very
old
princess
heinrich
permitted
a
smile
to
appear
on
her
face
as
with
a
wave
of
her
fan
she
relegated
coralie
to
a
proper
insignificance
she
was
smiling
still
as
she
added
there
another
old
acquaintance
coming
to
assist
at
the
wedding
augustin
i
telegraphed
to
ask
her
and
she
has
answered
accepting
the
invitation
in
the
warmest
terms
indeed
who
is
that
pray
the
baroness
said
my
mother
i
stared
at
her
then
i
cried
with
a
laugh
krak
not
krak
yes
krak
as
you
naughty
children
used
to
call
her
good
heavens
does
the
world
still
hold
krak
of
course
she
rather
an
old
woman
though
you
be
kind
to
her
augustin
she
was
always
very
fond
of
you
i
will
treat
krak
said
i
with
all
affection
surely
i
would
for
krak
coming
put
the
crown
of
completeness
on
the
occasion
but
i
was
amazed
krak
was
utterly
stuff
of
the
past
my
mother
did
not
appear
to
desire
my
presence
longer
i
had
to
take
up
my
own
position
and
receive
farewells
a
dreary
half
hour
passed
in
this
occupation
at
last
the
throng
grew
thin
i
broke
away
and
sauntered
off
to
a
buffet
for
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
champagne
there
i
saw
wetter
and
varvilliers
standing
together
and
refreshing
their
jaded
bodies
i
joined
them
at
once
full
of
the
news
about
krak
it
fell
rather
flat
i
regret
to
say
krak
had
not
significance
for
them
and
wetter
was
full
of
wild
brilliant
talk
varvilliers
manner
on
the
other
hand
although
displaying
now
no
awkwardness
or
restraint
showed
unusual
gentleness
and
gravity
with
an
added
friendliness
very
welcome
to
me
i
stood
between
my
friends
sipping
my
wine
and
detaining
them
although
the
room
was
nearly
empty
i
felt
a
reluctance
to
part
and
an
invincible
repugnance
to
my
bed
come
to
my
quarters
i
said
and
we
have
cigars
varvilliers
bowed
ready
assent
wetter
face
twisted
into
a
smile
i
must
plead
excuse
to
the
command
he
said
then
you
a
rascal
wetter
i
want
you
man
and
you
ought
not
to
be
expected
anywhere
this
time
of
night
not
at
home
sire
home
least
of
all
said
varvilliers
smiling
but
i
have
guests
at
home
cried
wetter
i
left
them
too
long
but
her
royal
highness
did
invite
them
besides
it
was
necessary
to
practise
the
song
what
are
they
with
you
should
i
send
them
to
a
hotel
sire
my
friends
the
struboffs
no
no
sipping
my
wine
i
looked
doubtfully
from
one
to
the
other
the
king
observed
wetter
to
varvilliers
would
be
interested
in
hearing
a
rehearsal
of
the
song
but
said
i
krak
comes
and
i
dare
look
as
if
i
sat
up
beyond
my
hour
wetter
laid
his
finger
on
my
arm
one
more
night
he
said
varvilliers
laughed
i
have
the
same
old
servant
he
very
discreet
but
you
put
it
in
the
vorw√§rts
no
no
not
if
the
is
my
own
house
i
do
it
i
cried
come
let
have
a
carriage
mine
waits
said
varvilliers
at
your
disposal
i
see
about
it
and
off
he
ran
wetter
turned
to
me
an
interesting
quartette
there
in
the
recess
said
he
and
an
insolent
fellow
looking
on
at
it
said
i
i
write
an
article
on
your
impulsive
before
all
the
world
do
i
can
conceive
nothing
more
politic
it
shall
teem
with
sincerity
never
a
jest
anywhere
in
it
not
one
for
me
no
jests
are
in
place
only
when
one
tells
the
truth
a
lie
must
be
solemn
sire
true
write
it
to
your
mood
and
to
his
mood
he
wrote
it
eloquently
beautifully
charged
with
the
passion
of
that
joy
which
he
realized
in
imagination
but
could
not
find
in
his
stormy
life
i
read
it
two
or
three
days
later
at
artenberg
hey
for
the
and
one
night
more
he
cried
we
rolled
off
we
three
in
varvilliers
carriage
chapter
xxvii
of
grazes
on
the
knee
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
practised
the
voice
echoed
through
the
house
as
we
entered
for
a
moment
we
paused
in
the
hall
to
listen
then
wetter
dashed
up
the
stairs
crying
good
god
wooden
wooden
wooden
we
followed
him
at
a
run
he
flung
the
door
open
and
rushed
in
coralie
broke
off
her
singing
and
came
to
greet
me
with
a
little
cry
of
pleased
surprise
struboff
sat
at
the
piano
looking
rather
bewildered
supper
was
spread
on
a
table
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
when
struboff
tried
to
rise
wetter
thrust
him
back
into
his
seat
no
no
the
king
does
want
to
talk
to
you
he
said
he
wants
to
hear
madame
sing
to
hear
you
play
coralie
come
and
sing
again
and
for
god
sake
sing
it
as
if
it
meant
something
dear
coralie
it
such
nonsense
said
coralie
with
a
pouting
smile
nonsense
then
it
needs
all
your
efforts
as
if
as
if
i
say
it
meant
something
varvilliers
laughing
flung
himself
on
a
sofa
i
stood
at
the
end
of
the
piano
wetter
was
gesticulating
and
muttering
on
the
hearthrug
struboff
put
his
fingers
on
the
keys
again
and
began
to
play
after
a
sigh
of
weariness
coralie
uplifted
her
voice
it
came
fresh
and
full
the
weariness
was
of
the
spirit
only
the
piece
was
good
nay
very
good
there
were
feeling
and
passion
in
the
music
i
looked
at
struboff
his
fingers
moved
tenderly
tears
stood
in
his
little
eyes
coralie
shouted
perfect
notes
in
perfect
heartlessness
my
god
muttered
wetter
from
the
hearthrug
and
bounded
across
to
her
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
feel
feel
feel
he
cried
angrily
do
be
so
stupid
said
coralie
she
ca
feel
it
said
struboff
taking
his
handkerchief
and
wiping
brow
and
eyes
she
a
fortunate
woman
remarked
varvilliers
from
his
sofa
you
think
she
could
said
wetter
taking
both
her
hands
and
surveying
her
from
top
to
toe
you
think
she
could
understand
look
at
her
eyes
her
brows
her
lips
you
think
she
could
understand
look
at
her
hands
her
waist
her
neck
it
a
little
strange
is
it
see
she
smiles
at
me
she
has
an
adorably
good
temper
she
does
mind
me
in
the
least
it
just
that
she
happens
not
to
be
able
to
feel
during
all
this
outburst
struboff
played
softly
and
tenderly
a
large
tear
formed
now
in
each
of
his
eyes
and
presently
trickled
over
the
swelling
hillocks
underneath
his
cheek
bones
coralie
was
smiling
placidly
at
wetter
thinking
him
mad
enough
but
in
no
way
put
out
by
his
criticism
i
can
feel
it
said
wetter
in
a
whimsically
puzzled
tone
why
should
i
feel
it
i
not
young
or
beautiful
and
my
voice
is
the
worse
for
wear
because
i
had
to
denounce
the
king
so
much
nevertheless
i
can
feel
it
you
can
make
a
big
fool
of
yourself
observed
coralie
breaking
into
a
laugh
and
snatching
her
hands
away
from
him
yes
yes
yes
i
should
hope
so
he
cried
she
catches
the
point
is
there
hope
no
she
wo
make
a
fool
of
herself
there
no
hope
he
sank
into
a
chair
with
every
appearance
of
dejection
i
think
it
she
said
moving
toward
the
table
what
are
you
still
playing
for
she
called
to
struboff
let
him
play
said
i
perhaps
he
would
rather
play
than
sup
it
very
likely
coralie
admitted
with
a
shrug
struboff
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
nodded
solemnly
he
was
playing
low
now
giving
a
plaintive
turn
to
the
music
that
had
been
joyful
no
you
shall
try
it
once
again
cried
wetter
leaping
up
once
again
a
verse
of
it
i
stand
opposite
to
you
see
like
this
and
i
look
at
you
now
try
she
was
very
with
him
and
did
as
he
bade
her
he
took
his
stand
just
by
her
behind
struboff
and
gazed
into
her
face
i
could
see
him
his
lips
twitched
and
his
eyes
were
set
on
her
in
an
ardour
of
passion
look
in
my
eyes
and
sing
he
commanded
ah
you
silly
she
murmured
in
her
pleasant
lazy
drawl
she
threw
out
her
chest
and
filled
the
room
with
healthy
tuneful
sound
stop
he
cried
stop
i
can
endure
no
more
of
it
can
you
eat
yes
you
can
eat
in
god
name
come
and
eat
dear
coralie
coralie
appealed
to
me
do
you
think
i
sing
it
very
well
she
asked
i
can
fill
the
grand
opera
house
quite
easily
you
sing
it
to
perfection
said
i
there
nothing
wrong
nothing
at
all
wetter
here
is
mad
wetter
is
certainly
mad
echoed
varvilliers
rising
from
the
sofa
wetter
is
damned
mad
said
wetter
wetter
is
right
ah
so
right
came
in
a
despairing
grumble
from
poor
struboff
who
still
played
away
to
supper
to
supper
cried
wetter
you
right
all
of
you
and
right
and
i
mad
to
supper
no
let
struboff
play
struboff
you
want
to
play
play
on
struboff
nodded
again
and
played
on
his
notes
now
plaintive
now
triumphant
were
the
accompaniment
to
our
meal
filling
the
pauses
enriching
as
it
seemed
the
talk
but
coralie
was
deep
in
and
paid
no
heed
to
them
wetter
engaged
in
some
vehement
discussion
with
varvilliers
who
met
him
with
pertinacity
i
had
dropped
out
of
the
talk
and
sat
listening
dreamily
to
struboff
music
suddenly
coralie
laid
down
her
knife
and
turned
to
me
would
it
be
nice
if
i
were
going
to
be
married
to
you
she
asked
charming
said
i
but
what
of
our
dear
struboff
and
what
of
my
cousin
elsa
we
would
trouble
about
them
she
was
looking
at
me
with
a
shrewd
gaze
no
she
said
you
would
like
it
shall
we
try
another
arrangement
she
leaned
toward
me
and
laid
her
pretty
hand
on
my
arm
wetter
and
i
i
am
not
very
well
placed
but
let
it
pass
wetter
and
i
varvilliers
and
the
princess
you
and
the
countess
i
made
no
sign
of
appreciating
this
rather
penetrating
suggestion
you
more
capricious
than
fortune
more
arbitrary
than
fate
madame
said
i
moreover
you
have
again
forgotten
to
provide
for
m
struboff
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
smiled
no
she
said
meditatively
i
do
like
that
after
all
it
might
do
for
de
varvilliers
but
the
countess
is
too
old
and
wetter
there
would
cut
my
throat
we
ca
sacrifice
everything
to
give
varvilliers
a
princess
she
appeared
to
reflect
for
a
few
seconds
i
do
know
how
to
arrange
it
positively
i
should
be
at
a
loss
myself
if
i
were
called
upon
to
govern
the
world
at
short
notice
i
think
i
must
let
it
alone
i
do
see
how
to
make
it
better
thank
you
for
my
own
part
i
have
the
good
luck
to
be
in
love
with
my
cousin
coralie
lifted
her
eyes
to
mine
oh
no
she
drawled
quietly
then
she
added
with
a
laugh
do
you
remember
when
you
fought
wetter
heavens
yes
fools
that
we
were
not
a
word
of
it
nobody
knows
well
at
that
time
you
were
in
love
with
me
madame
i
will
have
the
honour
of
mentioning
a
much
more
remarkable
thing
to
you
if
you
please
sire
she
said
taking
a
bunch
of
grapes
and
beginning
to
eat
them
you
were
all
but
in
love
with
me
that
not
remarkable
you
too
humble
i
was
ah
yes
i
was
i
was
very
afraid
for
you
do
you
wish
that
instead
of
being
king
here
you
were
the
sultan
i
laughed
at
this
abrupt
and
somewhat
unceremonious
question
in
fact
coralie
said
i
there
are
only
two
really
satisfactory
things
to
be
in
this
life
all
else
is
miserable
compromise
tell
them
to
me
a
sultan
or
a
monk
and
pardon
me
give
me
the
latter
well
i
once
knew
a
monk
very
well
and
began
coralie
in
a
tone
of
meditative
reminiscence
but
rather
to
my
vexation
wetter
spoiled
the
story
by
asking
what
we
were
talking
about
with
our
heads
so
close
together
we
were
correcting
fate
and
destiny
i
explained
pooh
pooh
he
cried
you
not
get
rid
of
the
tragedy
and
only
spoil
the
comedy
let
it
alone
my
children
we
let
it
alone
and
began
to
chatter
honest
nonsense
this
had
been
going
on
for
a
few
minutes
when
i
became
aware
suddenly
that
struboff
had
ceased
playing
my
i
looked
round
he
sat
on
the
his
broad
back
like
a
bent
to
a
bow
and
his
head
settled
on
his
shoulders
till
a
red
bulge
over
his
collar
was
all
that
survived
of
his
neck
i
rose
softly
signing
to
the
others
not
to
interrupt
their
conversation
and
stole
up
to
him
he
did
not
move
his
hands
were
clasped
on
his
stomach
i
peered
round
into
his
face
its
lines
were
set
in
a
grotesque
heavy
melancholy
at
first
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
but
as
i
went
on
looking
at
him
something
of
feeling
came
over
me
and
i
grew
angry
that
he
was
doubtless
very
miserable
ceased
to
plead
for
him
nay
it
aggravated
his
offence
what
the
deuce
right
had
this
fellow
to
make
misery
repulsive
and
it
was
over
my
wedding
song
that
he
had
tortured
himself
into
this
ludicrous
condition
yet
again
it
was
a
pleasant
paradox
of
nature
to
dower
this
carcass
with
the
sensibility
which
might
have
given
a
crowning
charm
to
the
beauty
of
coralie
in
him
it
could
attract
no
love
to
him
it
could
bring
no
happiness
probably
it
caused
him
to
play
the
piano
better
if
this
justifies
nature
she
is
welcome
to
the
plea
for
my
part
i
felt
that
it
was
monstrously
bad
taste
in
him
to
come
and
be
miserable
here
and
now
in
forstadt
but
he
overshot
his
mark
good
god
my
dear
struboff
i
cried
in
extreme
annoyance
think
how
little
it
matters
how
little
any
of
us
care
even
if
you
like
how
little
you
ought
to
care
yourself
you
tumbled
down
on
the
gravel
very
well
stop
crying
and
do
for
heaven
sake
keep
showing
me
the
graze
on
your
knee
we
all
i
suppose
have
grazes
on
our
knees
get
your
mother
to
put
you
into
stockings
and
nobody
will
see
it
i
been
in
stockings
for
years
i
burst
into
a
laugh
he
did
not
understand
what
i
would
be
at
that
perhaps
was
hardly
wonderful
the
music
has
affected
me
he
mumbled
then
come
and
let
some
champagne
affect
you
i
advised
him
irritably
what
are
you
to
spoil
a
pleasant
evening
he
looked
at
me
with
ponderous
sorrowful
reproach
a
pleasant
evening
he
groaned
as
he
blew
his
nose
yes
i
cried
loudly
a
damnably
pleasant
evening
struboff
and
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
dragged
him
from
his
stool
and
carried
him
off
to
the
table
with
me
here
i
set
him
down
between
varvilliers
and
myself
wetter
and
coralie
deep
in
conversation
paid
no
heed
to
him
he
began
to
eat
and
drink
eagerly
and
with
appetite
you
perceive
struboff
said
i
persuasively
that
while
we
have
stomachs
and
none
my
friend
can
deny
that
you
have
one
the
world
is
not
empty
of
delight
you
and
i
may
have
our
grazes
varvilliers
have
you
a
graze
on
the
knee
by
chance
but
consider
i
pray
you
the
case
of
the
man
who
has
no
dinner
it
would
be
very
bad
to
have
no
dinner
said
struboff
in
meditation
besides
that
said
i
lightly
i
grew
better
tempered
every
moment
what
are
these
miseries
with
which
we
afflict
ourselves
to
be
empty
to
be
thirsty
to
be
cold
these
are
evils
was
ever
any
man
and
really
miserable
reflect
before
you
answer
struboff
he
drained
a
glass
of
champagne
and
i
suppose
reflected
if
he
had
his
piano
also
he
began
great
heavens
i
interrupted
with
a
laugh
coralie
turned
from
wetter
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
husband
he
perceived
her
glance
directly
his
appetite
appeared
to
become
enfeebled
and
he
drank
his
wine
with
apologetic
slowness
she
went
on
looking
at
him
with
a
merciless
amusement
his
whole
manner
became
expressive
of
a
wish
to
be
elsewhere
i
saw
varvilliers
smothering
a
smile
he
sacrificed
much
to
good
manners
i
myself
laughed
gently
suddenly
to
my
surprise
wetter
caught
coralie
by
the
wrist
you
see
that
man
he
asked
smiling
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
oh
yes
i
see
my
husband
said
she
your
husband
yes
shall
i
tell
you
something
you
remember
what
been
saying
to
you
very
well
you
repeated
it
often
are
you
going
to
repeat
it
now
out
loud
where
the
use
everybody
here
knows
i
tell
you
another
thing
he
leaned
forward
still
holding
her
wrist
tightly
look
at
struboff
he
said
look
well
at
him
i
am
giving
myself
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
struboff
said
coralie
very
well
when
you
die
because
you
grow
old
and
you
grow
ugly
and
at
last
after
you
have
become
very
ugly
you
die
coralie
looked
rather
vexed
a
little
perturbed
and
protesting
wetter
had
touched
the
one
point
on
which
she
had
troubled
herself
to
criticise
the
order
of
the
universe
when
i
say
you
die
pursued
wetter
when
after
growing
extremely
ugly
you
die
you
will
be
sent
to
hell
because
you
have
not
appreciated
the
virtues
or
repaid
the
devotion
of
my
good
friend
struboff
and
sire
he
turned
to
me
when
one
considers
that
it
appears
unreasonable
to
imagine
that
eternity
will
be
in
any
degree
less
peculiar
than
this
present
life
of
ours
that
all
very
well
said
coralie
but
after
having
grown
ugly
i
do
think
i
should
mind
anything
else
i
clapped
my
hands
i
think
said
i
if
struboff
will
pardon
the
supposition
that
madame
will
be
allowed
to
escape
perdition
for
see
she
will
stand
up
and
she
will
say
quite
calmly
with
that
adorable
smile
of
hers
they
do
mind
smiles
there
sire
put
in
varvilliers
she
smile
not
to
please
them
but
because
she
amused
said
i
she
say
with
her
adorable
smile
and
that
i
have
done
this
and
that
i
have
not
done
perhaps
i
did
wrong
i
have
not
studied
your
rules
but
you
ca
send
me
to
hell
they
all
appeared
to
be
listening
with
attentive
ears
here
a
good
advocate
said
wetter
let
us
hear
the
plea
ca
send
me
to
hell
because
i
have
not
pretended
i
have
been
myself
and
i
did
make
myself
i
ca
go
to
hell
with
the
pretenders
but
to
heaven
with
the
kings
asked
varvilliers
with
the
kings
who
have
not
also
been
pretenders
said
i
de
said
she
i
believe
that
i
shall
escape
after
all
so
you
and
i
will
be
separated
wetter
no
no
he
protested
unless
you
there
the
place
wo
be
itself
to
me
we
all
laughed
struboff
not
in
appreciation
but
with
a
nervous
desire
to
make
himself
agreeable
and
i
rose
from
my
seat
it
was
three
in
the
morning
struboff
yawned
mightily
as
he
drank
a
final
glass
and
patted
his
stomach
i
think
that
we
were
all
happier
than
when
we
sat
down
and
after
the
occasion
whither
i
asked
them
i
back
to
france
answered
varvilliers
we
to
munich
said
coralie
with
a
shrug
i
the
deuce
knows
where
laughed
wetter
i
also
the
deuce
knows
where
come
then
to
our
next
merry
supper
i
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
they
all
followed
my
example
and
we
drank
but
we
shall
have
no
more
said
wetter
a
moment
silence
fell
on
us
all
then
wetter
spoke
again
he
turned
to
them
and
indicated
me
with
a
gesture
he
a
good
fellow
our
augustin
yes
a
good
fellow
said
varvilliers
a
very
good
fellow
muttered
struboff
who
was
more
than
a
little
gone
in
liquor
a
good
fellow
said
coralie
then
she
stepped
up
to
me
put
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
a
good
fellow
our
little
augustin
said
she
there
was
nothing
much
in
this
casual
phrases
of
goodwill
spoken
at
a
moment
of
conviviality
the
outcome
of
genuine
but
perhaps
not
very
deep
feeling
except
for
that
trifle
of
the
kisses
almost
an
ordinary
accompaniment
or
conclusion
of
an
evening
entertainment
i
was
a
good
fellow
the
light
praise
had
been
lightly
won
yet
even
now
as
i
write
looking
back
over
the
years
i
can
not
when
i
accuse
myself
of
mawkishness
be
altogether
convinced
by
the
for
what
it
was
worth
the
thing
came
home
to
me
for
a
moment
it
overleaped
the
barriers
that
were
round
me
the
differences
that
made
a
hedge
between
me
and
them
for
a
moment
they
had
forgotten
that
i
was
not
merely
their
good
comrade
i
would
not
have
people
forget
often
what
i
am
but
now
and
then
it
is
pleasant
to
be
no
more
than
what
i
myself
am
and
the
two
there
wetter
and
varvilliers
were
the
nearest
to
friends
that
i
have
known
one
went
back
to
his
country
the
other
the
deuce
knew
where
i
should
be
alone
alone
i
made
my
way
back
from
wetter
house
alone
and
on
foot
i
had
a
fancy
to
walk
thus
through
the
decorated
streets
alone
to
pause
an
instant
before
the
countess
door
recollecting
many
things
alone
to
tell
myself
that
the
stocking
must
be
kept
over
the
graze
and
that
the
asking
of
sympathy
was
the
betrayal
of
my
soul
confidence
to
me
alone
to
be
weak
alone
to
be
strong
alone
to
determine
to
do
my
work
with
my
own
life
alone
to
hope
that
i
must
not
render
too
wretched
the
life
of
another
i
had
good
from
that
walk
of
mine
for
you
see
when
a
man
is
alone
above
all
i
think
when
he
is
alone
in
the
truce
of
night
one
day
fight
done
and
the
new
morning
battle
not
yet
joined
he
can
pause
and
stand
and
think
he
can
be
still
then
his
worst
and
his
best
steal
out
like
mice
from
their
holes
the
cat
of
convention
is
asleep
and
play
their
gambols
and
antics
before
his
eyes
he
knows
them
and
himself
and
reaches
forth
to
know
the
world
and
his
work
in
it
his
life
and
the
end
of
it
the
difference
if
any
that
he
has
made
by
spending
so
much
pains
on
living
it
was
four
when
a
sleepy
let
me
in
my
servants
had
orders
never
to
wait
beyond
two
and
in
my
rooms
all
was
dark
and
quiet
but
when
i
lit
a
candle
from
the
little
lamp
by
the
door
i
saw
somebody
lying
on
the
sofa
in
my
a
woman
figure
stretched
in
the
luxury
of
quiet
sleep
victoria
this
must
be
and
none
else
i
was
glad
to
see
her
there
and
to
catch
her
drowsy
smile
as
her
eyes
opened
under
the
glare
of
my
candle
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
my
dear
said
i
setting
down
the
candle
and
putting
my
hands
in
my
pockets
she
sat
up
whisking
her
skirts
round
with
one
hand
and
rubbing
her
eyes
with
the
other
i
came
to
tell
you
about
krak
krak
come
but
you
were
here
so
i
lay
down
and
i
suppose
i
went
to
sleep
i
suppose
you
did
and
how
krak
just
the
same
as
ever
brought
a
birch
with
her
in
case
i
should
rebel
at
the
last
victoria
laughed
oh
well
you
see
her
she
remarked
she
just
the
same
i
rather
glad
you
know
that
krak
has
been
softened
by
age
it
would
have
been
commonplace
besides
one
does
want
to
exaggerate
the
power
of
advancing
years
you
did
come
for
anything
except
to
tell
me
about
krak
victoria
got
up
came
to
me
and
kissed
me
no
nothing
else
she
said
she
stopped
a
moment
and
then
remarked
abruptly
you
not
a
bit
like
william
adolphus
no
said
i
divining
in
a
flash
her
thought
and
her
purpose
still
have
you
been
with
elsa
yes
after
cousin
elizabeth
and
mother
left
her
you
you
be
kind
to
her
i
told
her
that
she
was
very
silly
and
that
i
wished
i
was
going
to
marry
you
oh
you
did
but
she
wishes
to
marry
me
she
means
to
of
course
exactly
my
dear
you
waited
a
long
while
to
tell
me
something
i
knew
very
well
i
thought
perhaps
you
be
glad
to
see
me
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
where
have
you
been
not
to
the
countess
indeed
no
to
wetter
ah
the
singer
the
singer
of
my
victoria
victoria
looked
at
me
in
a
rather
despairing
fashion
her
singing
of
it
i
added
will
be
the
most
perfect
and
appropriate
thing
in
the
world
you
be
delighted
when
you
hear
it
for
the
rest
my
dear
sister
hammerfeldt
looks
down
from
heaven
and
is
well
pleased
victoria
sat
on
the
sofa
again
i
went
to
the
window
unfastened
the
shutters
and
pulled
up
the
blinds
a
single
star
shone
yet
in
the
gray
sky
i
stood
looking
at
it
for
a
few
minutes
then
lit
a
cigarette
and
turned
round
victoria
was
on
the
sofa
still
she
was
crying
in
a
quiet
way
not
passionately
but
with
a
rather
methodical
air
she
glanced
at
me
for
a
moment
but
said
nothing
neither
did
i
speak
i
leaned
against
the
wall
and
smoked
my
cigarette
for
five
minutes
i
should
suppose
this
state
of
things
went
on
then
i
flung
away
the
cigarette
victoria
stopped
crying
wiped
her
eyes
and
got
up
i
rather
wish
we
been
born
in
the
gutter
said
she
dear
she
kissed
me
and
i
bade
her
i
must
get
some
sleep
or
i
shall
look
frightful
i
hope
william
adolphus
wo
be
snoring
very
loud
i
hear
him
so
plainly
through
the
wall
she
said
as
she
started
for
the
door
chapter
xxviii
as
bederhof
arranged
of
the
next
day
i
have
three
visions
i
see
myself
with
krak
and
princess
heinrich
pride
illuminated
their
faces
with
a
cold
radiance
and
their
utterances
were
conceived
in
the
spirit
of
a
they
congratulated
the
world
on
its
ruler
the
kingdom
on
its
king
themselves
on
my
account
me
on
theirs
to
krak
i
was
her
achievement
to
my
mother
the
vindication
of
the
support
she
had
given
to
krak
and
the
refutation
of
my
own
grumblings
and
rebellion
how
could
i
not
be
reminded
of
my
coronation
day
how
not
smile
when
the
princess
after
observing
regretfully
that
the
baroness
would
not
be
able
to
educate
my
children
bade
me
inculcate
her
principles
in
the
mind
of
their
tutor
or
governess
she
was
afraid
she
said
that
dear
elsa
might
be
a
little
lacking
in
firmness
a
little
prone
to
that
indulgence
which
is
no
true
kindness
in
the
end
the
very
reverse
of
it
madame
added
krak
it
quite
time
enough
for
them
to
begin
to
do
as
they
like
when
they
grow
up
said
the
princess
heinrich
by
then
though
said
krak
they
will
have
learned
i
hope
to
do
what
they
ought
i
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
baroness
said
i
victoria
is
absurdly
weak
with
her
child
princess
heinrich
complained
krak
smiled
significantly
she
had
never
expected
much
of
victoria
the
repression
of
exuberant
wickedness
had
been
the
bounds
of
her
hope
krak
left
us
there
must
have
been
some
noticeable
expression
on
my
face
as
i
watched
her
go
for
my
mother
said
with
a
smile
i
know
you
think
she
was
severe
i
used
to
think
so
too
now
and
then
but
see
how
well
you
turned
out
augustin
madame
said
i
my
present
excellence
and
my
impending
happiness
reconcile
me
to
everything
you
had
a
very
happy
childhood
my
mother
observed
i
bowed
and
now
you
are
going
to
marry
the
girl
i
should
choose
for
you
above
all
others
again
i
bowed
and
public
affairs
are
quiet
and
satisfactory
a
third
time
i
bowed
kiss
me
augustin
said
my
mother
this
summary
of
my
highly
successful
life
and
reign
was
delivered
in
princess
heinrich
most
conclusive
manner
i
had
no
thought
of
disputing
it
i
was
almost
surprised
that
the
facts
themselves
did
not
suffer
an
immediate
transformation
to
match
the
views
she
expressed
what
matter
that
things
were
not
so
they
were
to
be
deemed
so
and
called
so
so
held
and
so
proclaimed
my
mother
courage
touched
my
heart
and
i
kissed
her
with
much
affection
it
is
no
inconsiderable
achievement
to
be
consistently
superior
to
reality
i
who
fought
desperate
doubtful
battles
crippled
by
a
secret
traitorous
love
of
the
enemy
could
not
but
pay
homage
to
princess
heinrich
victorious
front
next
i
see
myself
with
elsa
alone
for
a
little
while
with
elsa
exultant
in
her
pomp
observed
of
all
the
envy
of
all
the
centre
of
the
spectacle
frocked
and
jewelled
beyond
heart
desire
narcotized
by
fuss
and
finery
laughing
and
trembling
i
had
found
her
alone
with
difficulty
for
she
kept
some
woman
by
her
almost
all
the
day
she
did
not
desire
to
be
alone
with
me
that
was
to
come
at
artenberg
now
was
her
moment
and
she
strove
to
think
it
eternal
it
was
not
in
her
to
face
and
conquer
the
great
enemy
after
princess
heinrich
heroic
fashion
she
could
only
turn
and
fly
hiding
from
herself
how
soon
she
must
be
overtaken
she
chattered
to
me
with
nervous
fluency
making
haste
always
to
choose
the
topic
leaving
no
gap
for
the
entrance
of
what
she
feared
i
saw
in
her
eyes
the
apprehension
that
filled
her
once
it
had
bred
in
me
the
most
odious
humiliation
an
intense
longing
to
go
from
her
a
passionate
loathing
for
the
necessity
of
forcing
myself
on
her
i
was
chastened
now
i
should
not
be
in
so
bad
a
case
as
struboff
there
would
be
no
question
of
a
fresh
slice
of
bread
but
i
tried
to
harden
myself
against
her
declaring
that
desiring
the
prize
she
must
pay
the
price
and
deserved
no
pity
on
the
score
of
a
bargain
that
she
herself
had
ratified
alas
poor
dear
she
knew
neither
how
small
the
prize
was
nor
how
great
the
price
and
her
eyes
prayed
me
not
to
turn
her
fears
to
certainty
she
would
know
soon
enough
last
comes
the
vision
of
the
theatre
of
the
gala
performance
where
elsa
and
i
sat
side
by
side
ringed
about
with
great
folk
enveloped
in
splendour
making
a
spectacle
for
all
the
city
a
sight
that
men
now
remember
and
recall
there
through
the
piece
we
sat
and
my
mind
was
at
work
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
life
was
pictured
there
i
had
but
to
look
this
way
or
that
and
dead
things
rose
from
the
grave
and
were
for
me
alive
again
there
was
krak
hard
face
there
my
unconquerable
smile
a
glance
at
them
brought
back
childhood
with
its
rigours
its
pleasures
snatched
in
fearfulness
its
strange
ignorance
and
stranger
passing
gleams
of
insight
victoria
hand
ringed
and
gloved
and
braceleted
held
her
fan
i
remembered
the
little
bare
red
rapped
knuckles
away
in
a
box
to
the
right
close
by
the
stage
was
the
countess
with
her
husband
my
eyes
turned
often
toward
her
and
always
found
hers
on
mine
again
as
a
child
i
ran
to
her
asking
to
be
loved
again
as
a
boy
i
loved
her
and
wrung
from
her
reluctant
love
again
in
the
first
vigour
and
unsparing
pride
of
my
manhood
i
sacrificed
her
heart
and
my
delight
below
her
standing
near
the
orchestra
was
wetter
through
my
glass
i
could
see
the
smile
that
never
left
his
face
as
he
scanned
the
bedizened
row
in
which
i
sat
there
with
him
looking
on
jesting
scoffing
at
the
parade
there
was
place
for
me
not
here
playing
chief
part
in
the
comedy
what
talks
and
what
nights
had
we
had
together
how
together
had
we
fallen
from
heaven
and
ruefully
prayed
for
that
trick
of
falling
soft
see
he
smiles
more
broadly
what
is
it
struboff
has
stolen
in
and
dropped
heavily
into
a
seat
wetter
waved
a
hand
to
him
and
laughed
laugh
laugh
wetter
it
is
your
only
gospel
and
therefore
must
be
pardoned
its
inevitable
defects
laugh
even
at
poor
struboff
whose
stomach
is
so
gross
whose
feelings
so
fine
who
may
not
give
his
wife
a
piece
of
bread
and
would
ask
no
greater
joy
than
to
kiss
her
feet
and
laugh
at
varvilliers
too
who
although
he
sits
where
he
has
a
good
view
of
us
never
turns
his
eyes
toward
the
lady
by
my
side
but
is
most
courteously
unobservant
of
her
alone
among
all
the
throng
did
she
look
at
him
yes
for
he
will
not
look
toward
her
why
we
are
all
here
all
except
hammerfeldt
who
looks
down
from
heaven
and
coralie
who
is
coming
presently
to
sing
us
the
even
victoria
baron
is
here
and
victoria
sobs
of
terror
are
in
my
ears
again
bederhof
and
his
fellows
are
behind
me
the
real
and
the
unreal
the
dummies
and
the
men
they
are
all
here
each
in
his
place
in
the
tableau
when
coralie
comes
we
shall
be
complete
the
opera
ended
and
the
curtain
fell
there
was
a
buzz
of
talk
our
anthem
comes
now
elsa
said
i
yes
she
whispered
crushing
the
bizarre
satin
rag
of
a
programme
that
they
had
given
her
i
have
never
heard
madame
mansoni
she
added
i
glanced
at
her
there
was
a
blush
on
her
cheek
she
had
heard
of
madame
mansoni
although
she
had
not
heard
her
sing
i
put
up
my
glass
again
and
looked
at
wetter
he
nodded
slightly
but
unmistakably
then
flung
his
head
back
and
laughed
again
now
we
waited
only
for
coralie
with
her
coming
we
should
be
complete
the
music
began
by
arrangement
or
impulse
i
knew
not
which
everybody
rose
to
their
feet
only
elsa
and
i
sat
still
the
curtain
rose
and
coralie
was
revealed
in
her
rare
beauty
and
her
matchless
calm
a
moment
later
the
great
full
feelingless
voice
filled
the
theatre
she
had
had
no
doubt
that
she
could
fill
the
theatre
i
saw
struboff
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
shoulders
eloquent
of
despair
i
saw
wetter
with
straining
eyes
and
curling
lips
varvilliers
smiling
in
mischievous
remembrance
of
our
rehearsal
by
my
side
elsa
was
breathing
quick
and
fast
i
turned
to
her
her
eyes
were
sparkling
in
triumph
and
excitement
it
was
a
grand
moment
she
felt
my
glance
her
cheek
reddened
her
eyes
dropped
her
lip
quivered
the
swiftest
covert
glance
flew
toward
where
varvilliers
was
i
turned
away
with
a
sort
of
sickness
on
me
coralie
voice
rose
and
fell
chanting
out
her
words
the
deadness
of
her
singing
seemed
subtle
mockery
as
though
she
would
not
degrade
true
passion
to
the
service
of
this
sham
as
though
the
words
were
enough
for
such
a
marriage
and
the
spirit
scorned
to
sanction
it
elsa
eyes
were
on
her
now
and
the
countess
leaned
forward
gazing
at
her
the
last
verse
came
and
coralie
with
a
low
bow
and
a
smile
sang
it
direct
to
me
to
me
across
all
the
theatre
so
plainly
that
now
all
heads
were
turned
from
her
the
people
facing
round
and
looking
all
at
me
and
at
elsa
by
my
side
every
eye
was
on
us
the
song
ended
a
storm
of
cheers
burst
out
a
short
gasp
or
sob
came
from
elsa
the
cheers
swelled
and
swelled
handkerchiefs
waved
in
the
air
i
rose
to
my
feet
gave
elsa
my
hand
and
helped
her
to
rise
then
together
we
took
a
step
forward
and
bowed
to
all
silence
fell
coralie
voice
rose
again
repeating
the
last
verse
now
all
the
chorus
joined
in
we
stood
till
the
song
ended
again
and
through
the
tempest
of
cheers
there
had
been
no
such
enthusiasm
in
forstadt
within
the
memory
of
man
the
heart
of
the
people
went
forth
to
us
it
was
a
triumph
a
triumph
