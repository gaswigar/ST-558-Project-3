is
no
authoritative

it
evolved
over
the
course
of
time
indeed
in
multiple
directions
the
printing
upon

this

was
poorly
printed

we

corrected
outright
punctuation

grammatical

while
maintaining
its
original

of

very
few

such
as
birds

no

the

gained
much
of

stray

receipt
coyle
neither
exists
my
father
sudden
death
explains
sufficiently
i
was
left
in
ignorance
of
the
transaction
but
the
seals
on
the
deed
and
the
stamps
are
intact
here
it
is
sir

sir
e
sir

you

true
i

something
like
a
beggar
and
your
father
something
like
a
thief
coyle
i
see
the
first
plainly
sir
edward
but
not
the
second
sir
e
do
you
forget

that
your
father
was
a
charity
boy
fed
clothed
by
my
father
coyle
well
sir
edward
sir
e
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
sir
that
your
father
repaid
that
kindness
by
robbing
his
benefactor
coyle
certainly
not
but
by
advancing
money
to
that
benefactor
when
he
wanted
it
and
by
taking
the
security
of
one
of
his
estates
as
any
prudent
man
would
under
the
circumstances
sir
e
why
then
sir
the
benefactor
property
is
yours
coyle
pardon
me
the
legal
estate
you
have
your
equity
of
redemption
you
have
only
to
pay
the
money
and
the
estate
is
yours
as
before
sir
e
how
dare
you
sir
when
you
have
just
shown
me
that
i
can
not
raise
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
world
oh
florence

did
i
not
listen
to
you
when
you
warned
me
against
this
man
coyle
aside
oh
she
warned
you
did
she
aloud
i
see
one
means
at
least
of
keeping
the
ravensdale
estate
in
the
family
sir
e
what
is
it
coyle
by
marrying
your
daughter
to
the
mortgagee
sir
e
to
you
coyle
i
am
prepared
to
settle
the
estate
on
miss
trenchard
the
day
she
becomes
richard
coyle
sir
e
springing
up
you
insolent
scoundrel
how
dare
you
insult
me
in
my
own
house
sir
leave
it
sir
or
i
will
have
you
kicked
out
by
my
servants
coyle
i
never
take
an
angry
man
at
his
word
sir
edward
give
a
few
moments
reflection
to
my
offer
you
can
have
me
kicked

beggar
sir
edward
trenchard

beggar

my
children
reduced
to
labor
for
their
bread
to
misery
perhaps
but
the
alternative
florence
detests
him
still
the
match
would
save
her
at
least
from
ruin
he
might
take
the
family
name
i
might
retrench
retire
to
the
continent
for
a
few
years
florence
health
might
serve
as
a
pretence
repugnant
as
the
alternative
is
yet
it
deserves
consideration
coyle
who
has
watched
now

on

as
i
do
how
he
would
hear
such
a
proposal
at
first
a
torrent
of
rage
then
the
strong
ebb
of
selfishness
set
in
and
he
consented
to
listen
to
the
terms
to
view
them
as
something
to
be
considered
to
consider
them

good
heavens

be
true

will
not
believe

such
lips

right
to

my
distrust

past
taking
offence

more
than
can

heaped
upon
me
but
i
did
not
come
only
to
give
you
warning
of
your
danger

just
the
question

was
going
to
ask
flo
you
here

listening
asa
wal
it
was
purpose
i
went
in
there
to
take
a
snooze
i
heard
you
talking
and
i
thought
it
would
be
polite
of
me
not
to
listen
to
what
you
had
to
say
i
a
rough
sort
of
a
customer
and
do
know
much
about
the
ways
of
great
folks
but
i
got
a
cool
head
a
stout
arm
and
a
willing
heart
and
i
think
i
can
help
you
just
as
one
cousin
ought
to
help
another
flo
well
i
do
think
you
are
honest
mur
shall
i
go
on
flo
yes
we
will
trust
him
go
on
mur
i
found
the
ravensdale
mortgage
while
rumaging
in
an
old
deed
box
of
coyle
father
there
was
a
folded
paper
inside
the
deed
i
took
both
to
coyle
unopened
like
a
besotted
fool
that
i
was
my
belief
is
strong
that
the
paper
was
the
release
of
the
mortgage
that
the
money
had
been
paid
off
and
the
release
executed
without
the
seals
having
been
cut
from
the
original
mortgage
i
have
known
such
things
happen
asa
have
ye
now
well
if
a
yankee
lawyer
had
done
such
a
thing
he
would
have
judge
lynch
after
him
in
no
time
mur
you
can
but
find
that
release
we
may
unmask
this
diabolical
fiend
and
save
you
flo
but
surely
a
villain
of
coyle
stability
would
have
destroyed
the
paper
the
very
of
his
fraud
mur
i
fear
so
asa
do
you
now
wal
you
wrong
you
both
wrong
i
guess
you
either
on
you
done
much
cyphering
human
nature
the
key
stone
of
their
fraud
is
just
the
point
your
mighty
cute
rascals
always
leave
unsecured
come
along
with
me
stranger
and
we
just
work
up
this
sum
a
little
two
heads

better
than

yours

a
little
muddled
but
pretty
clear
and
if
i
do
circumvent
that
old
sarpint
coyle
flo
well

well
he
wa
the
only
one
there
was
the
old
squire
mark
trenchard
mary
starting
aside
my
grandfather
asa
oh
he
was
a
fine
old
hoss
as
game
as
a
bison
bull
and
as
gray
as
a
coon
in
the
fall
you
see
he
was
kinder
mad
with
his
folks
here
so
he
came
over
to
america
to
look
after
the
original
branch
of
the
family
that
our
branch
we
older
than
the
trenchard
on
this
side
of
the
water
yes
we
got
the
start
of
the
heap
mary
tell
me
trenchard
did
he
never
receive
any
letters
from
his
daughter
asa
oh
yes
lots
of
them
but
the
old
cuss
never
read
them
though
he
chucked
them
in
the
fire
as
soon
as
he
made
out
who
they
come
from
mary
aside
my
poor
mother
asa
you
see
as
nigh
as
we
could
reckon
it
up
she
had
gone
and
got
married
again
his
will
and
that
made
him
mad
and
well
he
was
a
queer
kind
of
a
rusty
fusty
old
coon
and
it
appeared
that
he
got
older
and
rustier
and
fustier
and
coonier
every
fall
you
see
it
always
took
him
in
the
fall
it
was
too
much
for
him
he
got
took
down
with
the
ague
he
was
so
bad
the
doctors
gave
him
up
and
mother
she
went
for
a
minister
and
while
she
was
gone
the
old
man
called
me
in
his
room
in
asa
boy
says
he
and
his
voice
rang
loud
and
clear
as
a
bell
in
says
he
well
i
comed
in
down
says
he
well
i
sot
down
you
see
i
was
always
a
favorite
with
the
old
man
my
boy
says
he
a
great
piece
of
paper
i
die
this
sheet
of
paper
makes
you
heir
to
all
my
property
in
england
well
you
can
calculate
i
pricked
up
my
ears
about
that
time
the
minister
came
and
i
left
the
room
and
i
do
believe
he
had
a
three
day
fight
with
the
devil
for
that
old
man
soul
but
he
got
the
upper
hand
of
satan
at
last
and
when
the
minister
had
gone
the
old
man
called
me
into
his
room
again
the
old
squire
was
sitting
up
in
his
bed
his
face
as
pale
as
the
sheet
that
covered
him
his
silken
hair
flowing
in
silvery
locks
from
under
his
red
cap
and
the
tears
rolling
from
his
large
blue
eyes
down
his
furrowed
cheek
like
two
mill
streams
will
you
excuse
my
lighting
a
cigar
for
the
story
is
a
long
awful
moveing
and
i
do
think
i
could
get
on
without
a
smoke
strikes
match
wal
says
he
to
me
and
his
voice
was
not
as
loud
as
it
was
afore
it
was
like
the
whisper
of
the
wind
in
a
pine
forest
low
and
awful
boy
said
he
feel
that
sinned
in
hardening
my
heart
against
my
own
flesh
and
blood
but
i
will
not
wrong
the
last
that
is
left
of
them
give
me
the
light
says
he
wal
i
gave
him
the
candle
that
stood
by
his
bedside
and
he
took
the
sheet
of
paper
i
was
telling
you
of
just
as
i
might
take
this
takes
will
from
pocket
and
he
twisted
it
up
as
i
might
this
lights
will
and
he
lights
it
just
this
way
and
he
watched
it
burn
slowly
and
slowly
away
then
says
he
boy
that
act
disinherits
you
but
it
leaves
all
my
property
to
one
who
has
a
better
right
to
it
my
own
darling
child
mary
meredith
and
then
he
smiled
sank
back
upon
his
pillow
drew
a
long
sigh
as
if
he
felt
relieved
and
that
was
the
last
of
poor
old
mark
trenchard
mary
poor
grandfather
buries
her
face
and
sobs
asa
after
bus
wal
i
guess
i
better
leave
her
alone

half
burned
will
there
lies
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
if
there
a
cent
asa
boy

a
hoss

off
mary
to
me
all
to
me
oh

how
we
have
all
wronged
poor
grandfather

gone
he
felt
after
such
tidings
he
felt
i
should
be
left
alone
who
would
suspect
there
was
such
delicacy
under
that
rough
husk
but
i
can
hardly
believe
the
startling
news

heiress
i
the
penniless
orphan
of
an
hour
ago
no
longer
penniless
but
alas
an
orphan

hour
ago
on
a
half
sheet
of
rough
paper
just
like
this
sees
will
like
this
picks
it
up
why
this
is
part
of
it
i
believe
mary
that
the
paper

lighted
his
cigar
with

then
he
lighted
his
cigar
with
pounds
here
is
old
mark

mary
oh

mean
flo
it
means
that

you
little
rogue

mary
generous
man
hides
face
in
florence
bosom
flo
oh
wo
i
convict

runs
off
mary
after
her
calling
florence
florence
as
scene
closes
change
scene
chamber
as
before
enter
montchessington
and
augusta
mrs
m
yes
my
child
while
de
boots
and
trenchard
are
both
here
you
must
ask
yourself
seriously
as
to
the
state
of
your
affections
remember
your
happiness
for
life
will
depend
upon
the
choice
you
make
aug
what
would
you
advise
mamma
you
know
i
am
always
advised
by
you
mrs
m
dear
obedient
child
de
boots
has
excellent
expectations
but
then
they
are
only
expectations
after
all
this
american
is
rich
and
on
the
whole
i
think
a
well
regulated
affection
ought
to
incline
to
asa
trenchard
aug
very
well
mamma
mrs
m
at
the
same
time
you
must
be
cautious
or
in
grasping
at
asa
trenchard
solid
good
qualities
you
may
miss
them
and
de
boots
expectations
into
the
bargain
aug
oh
i
will
take
care
not
to
give
up
my
hold
on

am
quite
sure
of
the
american
mrs
m
that
my

girl
enter
asa
ah
trenchard
we
were
just
talking
of
your
archery
powers

wal
i
guess
shooting
with
bows
and
arrows
is
just
about
like
most
things
in
life
all
you
got
to
do
is
keep
the
sun
out
of
your
eyes
look
straight
pull
strong
calculate
the
distance
and
you
sure
to
hit
the
mark
in
most
things
as
well
as
shooting
aug
but
not
in
england
trenchard
there
are
disinterested
hearts
that
only
ask
an
opportunity
of
showing
how
they
despise
that
gold
which
others
set
such
store
by
asa
wal
i
suppose
there
are
miss
gusty
aug
all
i
crave
is

if
that

had
only
given

would
have
been
a
bad
bargain
but
i
dare
no
more
ask
