detailed
accounts
of
george

life
have
hitherto
been
singularly
scanty
in
the
dearth
of
published
materials
a
considerable
portion
of
the
information
contained
in
this
biographical
study
has
necessarily
been
derived
from
private
sources
in
visiting
the
places
connected
with
george
eliot
early
life
i
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
meeting
her
brother
isaac
evans
and
was
also
fortunate
in
gleaning
many
a
characteristic
fact
and
trait
from
old
people
in
the
neighbourhood
contemporaries
of
her
father
robert
evans
for
valuable
help
in
forming
an
idea
of
the
growth
of
george
eliot
mind
my
warm
thanks
are
especially
due
to
her
oldest
friends
and
charles
bray
and
miss
hennell
of
coventry
miss
jenkins
the

schoolfellow
and
john

generously
afforded
me
every
assistance
in

a
great

my

are

to

the
one
of
which
i
have
most
freely

myself

speaking
of
the
contributions
made
to
literature
by
her
own
sex
george
eliot
in
a
charming
essay
written
in
awards
the
palm
of
intellectual
to
the
women
of
france
they
alone
says
the
great
english
author
have
had
a
vital
influence
on
the
development
of
literature
for
in
france
alone
the
mind
of
woman
has
passed
like
an
electric
current
through
the
language
making
crisp
and
definite
what
is
elsewhere
heavy
and
blurred
in
france
alone
if
the
writings
of
women
were
swept
away
a
serious
gap
would
be
made
in
the
national
history
the
reason
assigned
by
george
eliot
for
this
literary
superiority
of
frenchwomen
consists
in
their
having
had
the
courage
of
their
sex
they
thought
and
felt
as
women
and
when
they
wrote
their
books
became
the
fullest
expression
of
their
womanhood
and
by
being
true
to
themselves
by
only
seeking
inspiration
from
their
own
instead
of
servilely
copying
that
of
men
their
letters
and
memoirs
their
novels
and
pictures
have
a
distinct
nay
unique
value
for
the
student
of
art
and
literature
englishwomen
on
the
other
hand
have
not
followed
the
spontaneous
impulses
of
nature
they
have
not
allowed
free
play
to
the
peculiarly
feminine
element
preferring
to
mould
their
intellectual
products
on
the
masculine
pattern
for
that
reason
says
george
eliot
their
writings
are
usually
an
absurd
exaggeration
of
the
masculine
style
like
the
swaggering
gait
of
a
bad
actress
in
male
attire
this
novel
theory
concerning
a
specifically
feminine
manifestation
of
the
intellect
is
doubly
curious
when
one
compares
it
with
madame
de
staël
famous
saying
génie
pas
de
but
an
aphorism
however
brilliant
usually
contains
only
one
half
the
truth
and
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
women
have
already
and
will
much
more
largely
infuse
into
their
works
certain
intellectual
and
emotional
qualities
which
are
essentially
their
own
shall
we
however
admit
george
eliot
conclusion
that
frenchwomen
alone
have
hitherto
shown
any
of
this
original
bias
several
causes
are
mentioned
by
her
in
explanation
of
this
exceptional
merit
among
these
causes
there
is
one
which
would
probably
occur
to
every
one
who
began
to
reflect
on
this
subject
the
influence
of
the
salon
in
developing
and
stimulating
the
finest
feminine
talents
has
long
been
recognised
in
this
school
for
women
the
gift
of
expression
was
carried
to
the
utmost
pitch
of
perfection
by
their
active
in
the
discussion
of
the
most
vital
subjects
thought
became
clear
luminous
and
forcible
sentiment
gained
indescribable
graces
of
refinement
and
wit
with
its
brightest
scintillations
lit
up
the
sombre
background
of
life
but
among
other
causes
enumerated
as
accounting
for
that
more
spontaneous
productivity
of
frenchwomen
attributed
to
them
by
george
eliot
there
is
one
which
would
probably
have
occurred
to
no
other
mind
than
hers
and
which
is
too
characteristic
of
her
early
scientific
tendencies
to
be
omitted
for
according
to
her
the
present
superiority
of
frenchwomen
is
mainly
due
to
certain
physiological
peculiarities
of
the
gallic
race
namely
to
the
small
brain
and
vivacious
temperament
which
permit
the
fragile
system
of
woman
to
sustain
the
superlative
activity
requisite
for
intellectual
creativeness
whereas
the
larger
brain
and
slower
temperament
of
the
english
and
germans
are
in
the
womanly
organisation
generally
dreamy
and
passive
so
that
the
of
a
woman
may
suffice
as
the
substratum
for
a
superior
gallic
mind
but
is
too
thin
a
soil
for
a
superior
teutonic
one
so
knotty
and
subtle
a
problem
must
be
left
to
the
scientist
of
the
future
to
decide
perhaps
some
promising
young
physiologist
profiting
by
the
george
henry
lewes
studentship
founded
by
george
eliot
may
some
day
satisfactorily
elucidate
this
question
in
the
meanwhile
it
is
at
least
gratifying
to
reflect
that
she
does
not
deny
the
future
possibilities
of
even
english
and
german
women
she
admits
that
conditions
might
arise
which
in
their
case
also
would
be
favourable
to
the
highest
creative
effort
conditions
which
would
modify
the
existing
state
of
things
according
to
which
to
speak
in
her
own
scientific
phraseology
the
woman
of
large
capacity
can
seldom
rise
beyond
the
absorption
of
ideas
her
physical
conditions
refuse
to
support
the
energy
required
for
spontaneous
activity
the
voltaic
pile
is
not
strong
enough
to
produce
crystallisations
but
was
the
author
of
bede
not
herself
destined
to
be
a
triumphant
refutation
of
her
theory
or
had
those
more
favourable
circumstances
mentioned
as
vague
possibilities
already
arisen
in
her
case
not
that
we
believe
for
that
matter
in
the
superior
claims
of
illustrious
frenchwomen
it
is
true
george
eliot
enumerates
a
formidable
list
of
names
but
on
the
whole
we
may
boast
of
feminine
celebrities
that
need
not
shrink
from
the
comparison
there
is
of
course
much
truth
in
the
great
englishwoman
generous
praise
of
her
french
compeers
mme
de
sévigné
remains
she
says
the
single
instance
of
a
woman
who
is
supreme
in
a
class
of
literature
which
has
engaged
the
ambition
of
men
mme
dacier
still
reigns
the
queen
of
though
women
have
long
studied
greek
without
shame
mme
de
staël
name
still
rises
to
the
lips
when
we
are
asked
to
mention
a
woman
of
great
intellectual
power
mme
roland
is
still
the
unrivalled
type
of
the
sagacious
and
sternly
heroic
yet
lovable
woman
george
sand
is
the
unapproached
artist
who
to
jean
jacques
eloquence
and
deep
sense
of
external
nature
unites
the
clear
delineation
of
character
and
the
tragic
depth
of
passion
shall
we
be
forced
to
admit
that
the
representative
women
of
england
can
not
justly
be
placed
on
as
high
a
level
is
it
so
certain
that
they
too
did
not
speak
out
of
the
fulness
of
their
womanly
natures
that
they
too
did
not
feel
the
genuine
need
to
express
modes
of
thought
and
feeling
peculiar
to
themselves
which
men
if
at
all
had
but
inadequately
expressed
hitherto
was
not
queen
elizabeth
the
best
type
of
a
female
ruler
one
whose
keen
penetration
enabled
her
to
choose
her
ministers
with
infallible
judgment
did
not
fanny
burney
distil
the
delicate
aroma
of
girlhood
in
one
of
the
most
delightful
of
novels
or
what
of
jane
austen
whose
microscopic
fidelity
of
observation
has
a
scientific
accuracy
never
equalled
unless
in
the
pages
of
the
author
we
are
writing
of
sir
walter
scott
apparently
recognised
the
eminently
feminine
inspiration
of
her
writings
as
he
says
that
young
lady
had
a
talent
for
describing
the
involvements
and
feelings
and
characters
of
ordinary
life
which
is
for
me
the
most
wonderful
i
ever
met
with
the
strain
i
can
do
myself
like
any
now
agoing
but
the
exquisite
touch
which
renders
ordinary
commonplace
things
and
characters
interesting
from
the
truth
of
the
descriptions
and
the
sentiment
is
denied
to
me
then
turning
to
the
brontës
does
not
one
feel
the
very
heartbeats
of
womanhood
in
those
powerful
utterances
that
seem
to
spring
from
some
central
emotional
energy
again
does
not
browning
occupy
a
unique
place
among
poets
is
there
not
a
distinctively
womanly
strain
of
emotion
in
the
throbbing
tides
of
her
melodious
song
and
to
come
to
george
eliot
herself
will
any
one
deny
that
in
the
combination
of
sheer
intellectual
power
with
an
unparalleled
vision
for
the
homely
details
of
life
she
takes
precedence
of
all
writers
of
this
or
any
other
country
to
some
extent
this
wonderful
woman
conforms
to
her
own
standard
she
undoubtedly
adds
to
the
common
fund
of
crystallised
human
experience
as
literature
might
be
called
something
which
is
specifically
feminine
but
on
the
other
hand
her
intellect
excels
precisely
in
those
qualities
habitually
believed
to
be
masculine
one
of
its
chief
characteristics
consisting
in
the
grasp
of
abstract
philosophical
ideas
this
faculty
however
by
no
means
impairs
those
instinctive
processes
of
the
imagination
by
which
true
artistic
work
is
produced
george
eliot
combining
in
an
unusual
degree
the
subtlest
power
of
analysis
with
that
happy
gift
of
genius
which
enabled
her
to
create
such
characters
as
amos
barton
hetty
poyser
maggie
and
tom
tulliver
godfrey
cass
and
caleb
garth
which
seem
to
come
fresh
from
the
mould
of
nature
itself
indeed
she
has
hardly
a
rival
among
women
in
this
power
of
objective
imagination
by
which
she
throws
her
whole
soul
into
natures
of
the
most
varied
and
opposite
types
whereas
george
sand
only
succeeds
greatly
when
she
is
thoroughly
in
sympathy
with
her
creations
after
george
eliot
eulogium
of
french
women
one
feels
tempted
to
institute
a
comparison
between
these
two
great
contemporaries
who
occupied
the
same
leading
position
in
their
respective
countries
but
it
will
probably
always
remain
a
question
of
idiosyncracy
which
of
the
two
one
is
disposed
to
rank
higher
george
eliot
being
the
greatest
realist
george
sand
the
greatest
idealist
of
her
sex
the
works
of
the
french
writer
are
in
fact
prose
poems
rather
than
novels
they
are
not
studies
of
life
but
life
interpreted
by
the
poet
vision
george
sand
can
not
give
us
a
description
of
any
scene
in
nature
of
her
own
feelings
of
a
human
character
without
imparting
to
it
some
magical
effect
as
of
objects
seen
under
the
transfiguring
influence
of
moonlight
or
storm
clouds
whereas
george
eliot
loves
to
bathe
her
productions
in
the
broad
pitiless
midday
light
which
leaves
no
room
for
illusion
but
reveals
all
nature
with
uncompromising
directness
the
one
has
more
of
that
primitive
imagination
which
seizes
on
the
elemental
side
of
life
on
the
spectacle
of
the
starry
heavens
or
of
alpine
solitudes
on
the
insurrection
and
tumult
of
human
passion
on
the
shocks
of
revolution
convulsing
the
social
order
while
the
other
possesses
in
a
higher
degree
the
acute
intellectual
perception
for
the
orderly
sequence
of
life
for
that
unchangeable
round
of
toil
which
is
the
lot
of
the
mass
of
men
and
for
the
earth
in
its
homelier
aspects
as
it
tells
on
our
daily
existence
in
george
sand
finest
work
there
is
a
sweet
spontaneity
almost
as
if
she
were
an
oracle
of
nature
uttering
automatically
the
divine
message
but
on
the
other
hand
when
the
inspiration
forsakes
her
she
drifts
along
on
a
windy
current
of
words
the
fatal
facility
of
her
pen
often
beguiling
the
writer
into
vague
diffuseness
and
unsubstantial
declamation
in
this
respect
also
our
english
novelist
is
the
opposite
of
george
sand
for
george
eliot
invariably
remains
the
master
of
her
genius
indeed
she
thoroughly
fulfils
goethe
demand
that
if
you
set
up
for
an
artist
you
must
command
art
this
intellectual
never
forsakes
george
eliot
who
always
selects
her
means
with
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
ends
to
be
attained
the
radical
difference
in
the
genius
of
these
two
writers
to
both
of
whom
applies
browning
apt
appellation
of
woman
and
man
extends
naturally
to
their
whole
tone
of
thought
george
sand
is
impassioned
turbulent
revolutionary
the
spiritual
daughter
of
rousseau
with
an
enthusiastic
faith
in
man
future
destiny
george
eliot
contemplative
observant
instinctively
conservative
her
imagination
dearly
loving
to
do
a
little
toryism
on
the
sly
is
as
yet
the
sole
outcome
of
the
modern
positive
spirit
in
imaginative
literature
the
sole
novelist
who
has
incorporated
in
an
artistic
form
some
of
the
leading
ideas
of
comte
of
mazzini
and
of
darwin
in
fact
underlying
all
her
art
there
is
the
same
rigorous
teaching
of
the
inexorable
laws
which
govern
the
life
of
man
the
teaching
that
not
liberty
but
duty
is
the
condition
of
existence
the
teaching
of
the
incalculable
effects
of
hereditary
transmission
with
the
solemn
responsibilities
it
involves
the
teaching
of
the
inherent
sadness
and
imperfection
in
human
nature
which
render
resignation
the
first
virtue
of
man
in
fact
as
a
moral
influence
george
eliot
can
not
so
much
be
compared
with
george
sand
or
with
any
other
novelist
of
her
generation
as
with
carlyle
she
had
indeed
a
far
more
explicit
ethical
code
to
offer
than
the
author
of
resartus
for
though
the
immense
force
of
the
latter
personality
glowing
through
his
writings
had
a
tonic
effect
in
promoting
a
healthy
moral
tone
there
was
little
of
positive
moral
truth
to
be
gathered
from
them
but
the
lessons
which
george
eliot
would
fain
teach
to
men
were
most
unmistakable
in
their
bearing
the
lessons
of
pitying
love
towards
of
sympathy
with
all
human
suffering
of
unwavering
faithfulness
towards
the
social
bond
consisting
in
the
claims
of
race
of
country
of
family
of
unflagging
aspiration
after
that
life
which
is
most
beneficent
to
the
community
that
life
in
short
towards
which
she
herself
aspired
in
the
now
famous
prayer
to
reach
that
purest
heaven

other

origin
was
a
staffordshire
man
from
ellaston
near
ashbourne
and
began
life
as
a
carpenter
in
the
kitchen
at
griff
house
may
still
be
seen
a
oaken
press
a
sample
of
his
workmanship
a
portrait
of
him
also
preserved
there
is
known
among
the
family
as
adam
bede
it
is
not
as
good
a
likeness
as
that
of
a
certain
carefully
painted
miniature
the
features
of
which
bear
an
unmistakable
resemblance
to
those
of
the
daughter
destined
to
immortalise
his
name
a
strongly
marked
yet
handsome
face
massive
in
structure
and
with
brown
eyes
whose
shrewd
penetrating
glance
is
particularly
noticeable
betoken
the
man
of
strong
practical
intelligence
of
rare
energy
and
endurance
his
career
and
character
are
partially
depicted
in
adam
bede
caleb
garth
and
hackit
portraitures
in
which
the
different
stages
of
his
life
are
recorded
with
a
mingling
of
fact
and
fiction
a
shadowing
forth
of
the
same
nature
is
discernible
in
the
devotion
of
stradivarius
to
his
noble
craft
and
even
in
the
tender
paternity
of
tulliver
there
are
indications
of
another
phase
of
the
same
individuality
like
adam
bede
evans
from
carpenter
rose
to
be
forester
and
from
forester
to
be
it
was
in
the
latter
capacity
alone
that
he
was
ever
known
in
warwickshire
at
one
time
he
was
surveyor
to
five
estates
in
the
midland
counties
those
of
lord
aylesford
lord
lifford
bromley
davenport
gregory
and
sir
roger
newdigate
the
last
was
his
principal
employer
having
early
discerned
the
exceptional
capacity
of
the
man
sir
roger
induced
him
to
settle
in
warwickshire
and
take
charge
of
his
estates
sir
roger
seat
arbury
hall
is
the
original
of
the
charming
description
of
cheverel
manor
in
love
story
it
is
said
that
evans
trustworthiness
had
become
proverbial
in
the
county
but
while
faithfully
serving
his
employers
he
also
enjoyed
great
popularity
among
their
tenants
he
was
gentle
but
of
indomitable
firmness
and
while
stern
to
the
idle
and
unthrifty
he
did
not
press
heavily
on
those
who
might
be
behindhand
with
their
rent
owing
to
or
misfortune
on
quarter
days
evans
was
twice
married
he
had
lost
his
first
wife
by
whom
he
had
a
son
and
a
daughter
before
settling
in
warwickshire
of
his
second
wife
whose
maiden
name
was
pearson
very
little
is
known
she
must
therefore
according
to
schiller
have
been
a
pattern
of
womanhood
for
he
says
that
the
best
women
like
the
best
ruled
states
have
no
history
we
have
it
on
very
good
authority
however
that
hackit
in
barton
is
a
faithful
likeness
of
george
eliot
mother
this
may
seem
startling
at
first
but
on
reflection
she
is
the
woman
one
might
have
expected
being
a
figure
with
a
heart
as
tender
as
her
tongue
is
sharp
she
is
described
as
a
thin
woman
with
a
chronic
of
indefatigable
industry
and
epigrammatic
speech
who
in
the
utmost
enjoyment
of
spoiling
a
was
never
known
to
spoil
a
stocking
a
notable
housewife
whose
clockwork
regularity
in
all
domestic
affairs
was
such
that
all
her
was
done
by
nine
in
the
morning
when
she
would
sit
down
to
her
loom
in
the
same
spirit
she
brought
out
her
furs
on
the
first
of
november
whatever
might
be
the
temperature
she
was
not
a
woman
weakly
to
accommodate
herself
to
proceedings
if
the
season
did
know
what
it
ought
to
do
hackit
did
in
her
best
days
it
was
always
sharp
weather
at
plot
and
she
did
like
new
fashions
keenly
observant
and
quick
of
temper
she
was
yet
full
of
good
nature
her
sympathy
showing
itself
in
the
active
helpfulness
with
which
she
came
to
the
assistance
of
poor
milly
barton
and
the
love
she
showed
to
her
children
who
however
declined
kissing
her
is
there
not
a
strong
family
resemblance
between
this
character
and
poyser
that
masterpiece
of
george
eliot
art
mary
ann
gift
of
pointed
speech
was
therefore
in
the
true
sense
and
her
rich
humour
and
marvellous
powers
of
observation
were
derived
from
the
same
side
while
her
conscientiousness
her
capacity
and
that
faculty
of
taking
pains
which
is
so
large
a
factor
in
the
development
of
genius
came
more
directly
from
the
father
evans
had
three
children
by
his
second
wife
christiana
isaac
and
mary
ann
it
is
interesting
i
think
writes
george
eliot
in
reply
to
some
questions
of
an
american
lady
to
know
whether
a
writer
was
born
in
a
central
or
border
district
a
condition
which
always
has
a
strongly
determining
influence
i
was
born
in
warwickshire
but
certain
family
traditions
connected
with
more
northerly
districts
made
these
districts
a
region
of
poetry
to
me
in
my
early
childhood
in
the
autobiographical
sonnets
entitled
and
sister
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
mother
preparing
her
children
for
their
accustomed
ramble
by
stroking
down
the
tippet
and
setting
the
frill
in
order
then
standing
on
the
to
follow
their
lessening
figures
with
the
benediction
of
her
gaze
evans
was
aware
to
a
certain
extent
of
her
daughter
unusual
capacity
being
anxious
not
only
that
she
should
have
the
best
education
attainable
in
the
neighbourhood
but
also
that
good
moral
influences
should
be
brought
to
bear
upon
her
still
the
girl
constant
habit
of
reading
even
in
bed
caused
the
practical
mother
not
a
little
annoyance
the
house
where
the
family
lived
at
that
time
and
in
which
the
first
twenty
years
of
mary
ann
evans
life
were
spent
is
situated
in
a
rich
verdant
landscape
where
the
grassy
fields
each
with
a
sort
of
personality
given
to
it
by
the
capricious
blend
harmoniously
with
the
cottages
scattered
in
a
happy
haphazard
fashion
amid
orchards
and
sixty
years
ago
the
country
was
much
more
thickly
wooded
than
now
and
from
the
windows
of
griff
house
might
be
seen
the
oaks
and
elms
that
had
still
survived
from
shakespeare
forest
of
arden
the
house
of
the
evans
family
half
half
farm
was
an
building
two
stories
high
with
red
brick
walls
thickly
covered
with
ivy
like
the
garths
they
were
probably
very
fond
of
their
old
house
a
lawn
interspersed
with
trees
stretched
in
front
towards
the
gate
flanked
by
two
stately
norway
firs
while
a
sombre
old
yew
almost
touched
some
of
the
upper
windows
with
its
branches
a
was
at
the
back
with
low
rambling
sheds
and
stables
and
beyond
that
bounded
by
quiet
meadows
one
may
still
see
the
identical
leafy
flowery
bushy
garden
which
george
eliot
so
often
delighted
in
describing
at
a
time
when
her
early
life
with
all
its
tenderly
hoarded
associations
had
become
to
her
but
a
haunting
memory
of
bygone
things
a
garden
where
roses
and
cabbages
jostle
each
other
where
vegetables
have
to
make
room
for
gnarled
old
and
where
amid
the
raspberry
bushes
and
row
of
currant
trees
you
expect
to
come
upon
hetty
herself
stooping
to
gather
the
fruit
such
was
the
place
where
the
childhood
of
george
eliot
was
spent
here
she
drew
in
those
impressions
of
english
rural
and
provincial
life
of
which
one
day
she
was
to
become
the
greatest
interpreter
impossible
to
be
in
a
better
position
for
seeing
life
not
only
was
her
position
always
improving
so
that
she
was
early
brought
in
contact
with
different
grades
of
society
but
his
calling
made
him
more
or
less
acquainted
with
all
ranks
of
his
neighbours
and
says
george
eliot
i
have
always
thought
that
the
most
fortunate
britons
are
those
whose
experience
has
given
them
a
practical
share
in
many
aspects
of
the
national
lot
who
have
lived
long
among
the
mixed
commonalty
roughing
it
with
them
under
difficulties
knowing
how
their
food
tastes
to
them
and
getting
acquainted
with
their
notions
and
motives
not
by
inference
from
traditional
types
in
literature
or
from
philosophical
theories
but
from
daily
fellowship
and
observation
and
what
kind
of
a
child
was
it
who
loitered
about
the
and
garden
and
fields
noticing
everything
with
grave
watchful
eyes
and
storing
it
in
a
memory
of
extraordinary
tenacity
one
of
her
schoolfellows
who
knew
her
at
the
age
of
thirteen
confessed
to
me
that
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
george
eliot
as
a
baby
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
have
come
into
the
world
fully
developed
like
a
second
minerva
her
features
were
fully
formed
at
a
very
early
age
and
she
had
a
seriousness
of
expression
almost
startling
for
her
years
the
records
of
her
may
be
deciphered
amid
some
romantic
alterations
in
the
early
history
of
tom
and
maggie
tulliver
isaac
and
mary
ann
evans
were
playmates
like
these
the
latter
having
all
the
tastes
of
a
boy
whereas
her
sister
chrissy
said
to
be
the
original
of
lucy
deane
had
peculiarly
dainty
feminine
ways
and
shrank
from
rambles
for
fear
of
soiling
her
shoes
or
pinafore
but
mary
ann
and
her
brother
went
fishing
together
or
spinning
tops
or
digging
for
and
the
incident
of
the
little
girl
being
left
to
mind
the
rod
and
losing
herself
in
dreamy
contemplation
oblivious
of
her
task
is
evidently
taken
from
life
and
may
be
quoted
as
a
reminiscence
of
her
own
childhood
one
day
my
brother
left
me
in
high
charge
to
mind
the
rod
while
he
went
seeking
bait
and
bade
me
when
i
saw
a
nearing
barge
snatch
out
the
line
lest
he
should
come
too
late
proud
of
the
task
i
watched
with
all
my
might
for
one
whole
minute
till
my
eyes
grew
wide
till
sky
and
earth
took
on
a
new
strange
light
and
seemed
a
floating
on
some
tide
a
fair
pavilioned
boat
for
me
alone
bearing
me
onward
through
the
vast
unknown
but
sudden
came
the
barge
prow
nearer
and
angrier
came
my
brother
cry
and
all
my
soul
was
quivering
fear
when
lo
upon
the
imperilled
line
suspended
high
a
silver
perch
my
guilt
that
won
the
prey
now
turned
to
merit
had
a
guerdon
rich
of
hugs
and
praises
and
made
merry
play
until
my
triumph
reached
its
highest
pitch
when
all
at
home
were
told
the
wondrous
feat
and
how
the
little
sister
had
fished
well
in
secret
though
my
fortune
tasted
sweet
i
wondered
why
this
happiness
befell
little
lass
had
luck
the
gardener
said
and
so
i
learned
luck
was
to
glory
unlike
maggie
however
little
mary
ann
was
as
good
a
hand
at
fishing
as
her
brother
only
differing
from
him
in
not
liking
to
put
the
worms
on
the
hooks
another
incident
taken
from
real
life
if
somewhat
magnified
is
the
adventure
with
the
gipsies
for
the
prototype
of
maggie
also
fell
among
these
marauding
vagrants
and
was
detained
a
little
time
among
them
whether
she
also
proposed
to
instruct
the
gipsies
and
to
gain
great
influence
over
them
by
teaching
them
something
about
geography
and
columbus
does
not
transpire
but
indeed
most
of
maggie
early
experiences
are
autobiographic
down
to
such
facts
as
her
father
telling
her
to
rub
her
turnip
cheeks
against
sally
to
get
a
little
bloom
and
to
cutting
off
one
side
of
her
hair
in
a
passion
at
a
very
early
age
mary
ann
and
her
brother
were
sent
to
the
village
free
school
at
colton
in
the
parish
of
griff
a
not
unusual
custom
in
those
days
when
the
means
of
tuition
for
little
children
were
much
more
difficult
to
procure
than
now
there
are
still
old
men
living
who
used
to
sit
on
the
same
form
with
little
mary
ann
evans
learning
her
a
b
c
and
a
certain
william
jacques
the
original
of
the
delightfully
comic
bob
jakins
of
fiction
remembers
carrying
her
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
her
father
house
as
the
brother
and
sister
grew
older
they
saw
less
of
each
other
mary
ann
being
sent
to
a
school
at
nuneaton
kept
by
miss
lewis
for
whom
she
retained
an
affectionate
regard
long
years
afterwards
about
the
same
time
she
taught
at
a
in
a
little
cottage
adjoining
her
father
house
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
being
then
in
the
words
of
a
neighbour
who
occasionally
called
at
griff
house
a
queer
awkward
girl
who
sat
in
corners
and
shyly
watched
her
elders
she
was
placed
as
boarder
with
the
misses
franklin
at
coventry
this
school
then
in
high
repute
throughout
the
neighbourhood
was
kept
by
two
sisters
of
whom
the
younger
miss
rebecca
franklin
was
a
woman
of
unusual
attainments
and
ladylike
culture
although
not
without
a
certain
taint
of
johnsonian
affectation
she
seems
to
have
thoroughly
grounded
miss
evans
in
a
sound
english
education
laying
great
stress
in
particular
on
the
propriety
of
a
precise
and
careful
manner
of
speaking
and
reading
she
herself
always
made
a
point
of
expressing
herself
in
studied
sentences
and
on
one
occasion
when
a
friend
had
called
to
ask
after
a
dying
relative
she
actually
kept
the
servant
waiting
till
she
had
framed
an
appropriately
worded
message
miss
evans
in
whose
family
a
broad
provincial
dialect
was
spoken
soon
acquired
miss
carefully
elaborated
speech
and
not
content
with
that
she
might
be
said
to
have
created
a
new
voice
for
herself
in
later
life
every
one
who
knew
her
was
struck
by
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
the
finished
construction
of
every
sentence
as
it
fell
from
her
lips
for
by
that
time
the
acquired
habit
had
become
second
nature
and
blended
harmoniously
with
her
entire
personality
but
in
those
early
days
the
artificial
effort
at
perfect
propriety
of
expression
was
still
perceptible
and
produced
an
impression
of
affectation
perhaps
reflecting
that
of
her
revered
instructress
it
is
also
believed
that
some
of
the
beauty
of
her
intonation
in
reading
english
poetry
was
owing
to
the
same
early
influence
mary
ann
or
marian
as
she
came
afterwards
to
be
called
remained
about
three
years
with
the
misses
franklin
she
stood
aloof
from
the
other
pupils
and
one
of
her
schoolfellows
miss
bradley
jenkins
says
that
she
was
quite
as
remarkable
in
those
early
days
as
after
she
had
acquired
fame
she
seems
to
have
strangely
impressed
the
imagination
of
the
latter
who
figuratively
speaking
looked
up
at
her
as
at
a
mountain
there
was
never
anything
of
the
schoolgirl
about
miss
evans
for
even
at
that
early
age
she
had
the
manners
and
appearance
of
a
grave
staid
woman
so
much
so
that
a
stranger
happening
to
call
one
day
mistook
this
girl
of
thirteen
for
one
of
the
misses
franklin
who
were
then
women
in
this
also
there
is
a
certain
resemblance
to
maggie
tulliver
who
at
the
age
of
thirteen
is
described
as
looking
already
like
a
woman
english
composition
french
and
german
were
some
of
the
studies
to
which
much
time
and
attention
were
devoted
being
greatly
in
advance
of
the
other
pupils
in
the
knowledge
of
french
miss
evans
and
miss
jenkins
were
taken
out
of
the
general
class
and
set
to
study
it
together
but
though
the
two
girls
were
thus
associated
in
a
closer
fellowship
no
real
intimacy
apparently
followed
from
it
the
latter
watched
the
future
george
eliot
with
intense
interest
but
always
felt
as
if
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
though
socially
their
positions
were
much
on
a
par
this
haunting
sense
of
superiority
precluded
the
growth
of
any
closer
friendship
between
the
two
all
the
more
startling
was
it
to
the
admiring
schoolgirl
when
one
day
on
using
marian
evans
german
dictionary
she
saw
scribbled
on
its
blank
page
some
verses
evidently
original
expressing
rather
sentimentally
a
yearning
for
love
and
sympathy
under
this
exterior
then
there
was
beating
a
heart
that
passionately
craved
for
human
tenderness
and
companionship
inner
solitude
was
no
doubt
the
portion
of
george
eliot
in
those
days
she
must
already
have
had
a
dim
consciousness
of
unusual
power
to
a
great
extent
isolating
her
from
the
girls
of
her
own
age
absorbed
as
they
were
in
quite
other
feelings
and
ideas
strong
religious
convictions
pervaded
her
life
at
this
period
and
in
the
fervid
faith
and
spiritual
exaltation
which
characterise
maggie
girlhood
we
have
a
very
faithful
picture
of
the
future
novelist
own
state
of
mind
passing
through
many
stages
of
religious
thought
she
was
first
simple
church
of
england
then
low
church
then
in
this
latter
character
she
wore
an
cap
in
which
so
says
an
early
friend
her
plain
features
looked
all
the
plainer
but
her
nature
was
a
mixed
one
as
indeed
is
maggie
too
and
conflicting
tendencies
and
inclinations
pulled
her
no
doubt
in
different
directions
the
impulses
of
one
moment
were
checkmated
at
another
by
an
eager
desire
for
approbation
and
distinguishing
and
a
piety
verging
on
asceticism
did
not
exclude
on
the
other
hand
a
very
clear
perception
of
the
advantages
and
desirability
of
good
birth
wealth
and
high
social
position
like
her
own
charming
esther
in
holt
she
had
a
fine
sense
amid
somewhat
anomalous
surroundings
of
the
highest
refinements
and
delicacies
which
are
supposed
to
be
the
natural
attributes
of
people
of
rank
and
fashion
she
even
shared
with
the
heroine
certain
girlish
vanities
and
weaknesses
such
as
liking
to
have
all
things
about
her
person
as
elegant
as
possible
about
the
age
of
fifteen
marian
evans
left
the
misses
franklin
and
soon
afterwards
she
had
the
misfortune
of
losing
her
mother
who
died
in
her
year
writing
to
a
friend
in
after
life
she
says
i
began
at
sixteen
to
be
acquainted
with
the
unspeakable
grief
of
a
last
parting
in
the
death
of
my
mother
less
sorrowful
partings
ensued
though
in
the
end
they
proved
almost
as
irrevocable
her
elder
sister
and
the
brother
in
whose
steps
she
had
once
followed
married
and
settled
in
homes
of
their
own
their
different
lots
in
life
and
the
far
more
pronounced
differences
of
their
aims
and
ideas
afterwards
divided
the
brother
and
sister
completely
this
kind
of
separation
between
people
who
have
been
friends
in
youth
is
often
more
terrible
to
endure
than
the
actual
loss
by
death
itself
and
doth
truly
work
like
madness
in
the
brain
is
there
not
some
reference
to
this
in
that
pathetic
passage
in
bede
family
likeness
has
often
a
deep
sadness
in
it
nature
that
great
tragic
dramatist
knits
us
together
by
bone
and
muscle
and
divides
us
by
the
subtler
web
of
our
brains
blends
yearning
and
repulsion
and
ties
us
by
our
heartstrings
to
the
beings
that
jar
us
at
every
movement
we
see
eyes
ah
so
like
our
mother
averted
from
us
in
cold
alienation
for
some
years
after
this
miss
evans
and
her
father
remained
alone
together
at
griff
house
he
offered
to
get
a
housekeeper
as
not
the
house
only
but
farm
matters
had
to
be
looked
after
and
he
was
always
tenderly
considerate
of
the
little
wench
as
he
called
her
but
his
daughter
preferred
taking
the
whole
management
of
the
place
into
her
own
hands
and
she
was
as
conscientious
and
diligent
in
the
discharge
of
her
domestic
duties
as
in
the
prosecution
of
the
studies
she
carried
on
at
the
same
time
one
of
her
chief
beauties
was
in
her
large
feminine
hands
hands
which
she
has
indeed
described
as
characteristic
of
several
of
her
heroines
but
she
once
pointed
out
to
a
friend
at
foleshill
that
one
of
them
was
broader
across
than
the
other
saying
with
some
pride
that
it
was
due
to
the
quantity
of
butter
and
cheese
she
had
made
during
her
housekeeping
days
at
griff
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
is
a
characteristic
attributed
to
the
exemplary
nancy
lammeter
whose
person
gave
one
the
idea
of
perfect
unvarying
neatness
as
the
body
of
a
little
bird
only
her
hands
bearing
the
traces
of
butter
making
cheese
crushing
and
even
still
coarser
work
certainly
the
description
of
the
dairy
in
bede
and
all
the
processes
of
butter
making
is
one
which
only
complete
knowledge
could
have
rendered
so
perfect
perhaps
no
scene
in
all
her
novels
stands
out
with
more
vividness
than
that
dairy
which
one
could
have
sickened
for
in
hot
dusty
streets
such
coolness
such
purity
such
fresh
fragrance
of
cheese
of
firm
butter
of
wooden
vessels
perpetually
bathed
in
pure
water
such
soft
colouring
of
red
earthenware
and
creamy
surfaces
brown
wood
and
polished
tin
grey
limestone
and
rich
rust
on
the
iron
weights
and
hooks
and
hinges
this
life
of
mixed
practical
activity
and
intellectual
pursuits
came
to
an
end
in
when
evans
relinquished
griff
house
and
the
management
of
sir
roger
newdigate
estates
to
his
married
son
and
removed
with
his
daughter
to
foleshill
near
coventry
chapter
iii
youthful
studies
and
friendships
the
period
from
about
twenty
to
thirty
is
usually
the
most
momentous
in
the
lives
of
illustrious
men
and
women
it
is
true
that
the
most
abiding
impressions
those
which
the
future
author
will
reproduce
most
vividly
have
been
absorbed
by
the
growing
brain
previous
to
this
age
but
the
fusion
of
these
varied
impressions
of
the
outward
world
with
the
inner
life
and
the
endless
combinations
in
which
imagination
delights
rarely
begin
before
then
as
a
rule
the
ideas
are
engendered
to
be
carried
out
in
the
maturity
of
life
alfred
de
vigny
says
truly
enough
grande
vie
une
pensée
de
la
jeunesse
exécutée
par
mur
moreover
it
is
a
revolutionary
age
inherited
opinions
that
had
been
accepted
as
the
rotation
of
the
seasons
with
unhesitating
acquiescence
become
an
object
of
speculation
and
passionate
questioning
nothing
is
taken
upon
trust
the
intellect
stimulated
by
the
sense
of
expanding
and
hitherto
unchecked
capacity
delights
in
exercising
its
strength
by
critically
passing
in
review
the
opinions
laws
institutions
commonly
accepted
as
unalterable
and
if
the
intellect
is
thus
active
the
heart
is
still
more
so
this
is
emphatically
the
time
of
enthusiastic
friendship
and
glowing
love
if
often
also
of
cruel
disenchantment
and
disillusion
in
most
biographies
therefore
this
phase
of
life
is
no
less
fascinating
than
instructive
for
it
shows
the
individual
while
still
in
a
stage
of
growth
already
reacting
on
his
environment
and
becoming
a
motive
power
according
to
the
measure
of
his
intellectual
and
moral
endowments
it
is
on
this
state
of
george
eliot
life
that
we
are
now
entering
at
foleshill
she
acquired
that
vast
range
of
knowledge
and
universality
of
culture
which
so
eminently
distinguished
her
the
house
she
now
inhabited
though
not
nearly
as
picturesque
or
substantial
as
the
former
home
of
the
evanses
was
yet
sufficiently
spacious
with
a
pleasant
garden
in
front
and
behind
it
the
latter
marian
evans
was
fond
of
making
as
much
like
the
delicious
garden
of
her
childhood
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
in
other
respects
she
greatly
altered
her
ways
of
life
cultivating
an
in
her
manners
and
household
arrangements
though
so
young
she
was
not
only
entire
mistress
of
her
father
establishment
but
as
his
business
required
him
to
be
abroad
the
greater
part
of
each
week
she
was
mostly
alone
her
life
now
became
more
and
more
that
of
a
student
one
of
her
chief
reasons
for
rejoicing
at
the
change
of
residence
being
the
freer
access
to
books
she
had
however
already
amassed
quite
a
library
of
her
own
by
this
time
in
addition
to
her
private
studies
she
was
now
also
able
to
have
masters
to
instruct
her
in
a
variety
of
subjects
the
rev
sheepshanks
headmaster
of
the
coventry
gave
her
lessons
in
greek
and
latin
as
she
particularly
wished
to
learn
the
former
language
in
order
to
read
æschylus
she
continued
her
study
of
french
german
and
italian
under
the
tuition
of
signor
brezzi
even
acquiring
some
knowledge
of
hebrew
by
her
own
unassisted
efforts
simms
the
veteran
organist
of
michael
coventry
instructed
her
in
the
pianoforte
and
probably
rosamond
vincy
teacher
in
is
a
faithful
portraiture
of
him
her
master
at
mrs
lemon
school
close
to
a
country
town
with
a
memorable
history
that
had
its
relics
in
church
and
castle
was
one
of
those
excellent
musicians
here
and
there
to
be
found
in
the
provinces
worthy
to
compare
with
many
a
noted
kapellmeister
in
a
country
which
offers
more
plentiful
conditions
of
musical
celebrity
george
eliot
sympathetic
rendering
of
her
favourite
composers
particularly
beethoven
and
schubert
was
always
delightful
to
her
friends
although
connoisseurs
considered
her
possessed
of
little
or
no
strictly
technical
knowledge
be
that
as
it
may
many
an
exquisite
passage
scattered
up
and
down
her
works
bears
witness
to
her
heartfelt
appreciation
of
music
which
seems
to
have
had
a
more
intimate
attraction
for
her
than
the
fine
arts
she
shows
little
feeling
for
archæological
beauties
in
which
warwickshire
is
so
rich
in
her
of
clerical
life
dismissing
a
fine
monument
of
lady
jane
grey
a
genuine
specimen
of
old
gothic
art
at
astley
church
with
a
sneer
about
marble
warriors
and
their
wives
without
noses
in
spite
of
excessive
study
this
period
of
marian
life
is
not
without
faint
echoes
of
an
early
of
her
own
in
the
house
of
one
of
her
married
she
met
a
young
man
who
promised
at
that
time
to
take
a
distinguished
position
in
his
profession
a
kind
of
engagement
or
took
place
which
evans
refused
to
countenance
and
finally
his
daughter
broke
it
off
in
a
letter
showing
both
her
strong
sense
and
profoundly
affectionate
nature
at
this
time
she
must
have
often
had
a
painful
consciousness
of
being
cut
off
from
that
living
fellowship
with
the
so
stimulating
to
the
intellectual
life
men
are
not
so
subject
to
this
form
of
soul
hunger
as
women
for
at
their
public
schools
and
colleges
they
are
brought
into
contact
with
their
contemporaries
and
can
not
fail
to
find
comrades
amongst
them
of
like
thoughts
and
aspirations
with
themselves
a
fresh
life
however
at
once
vivifying
to
her
intellect
and
stimulating
to
her
heart
now
began
for
marian
evans
in
the
friendship
she
formed
with
and
charles
bray
of
rosehill
coventry
rahel
the
subtly
gifted
german
woman
whose
letters
and
memoirs
are
a
treasury
of
delicate
observation
and
sentiment
observes
that
people
of
marked
spiritual
affinities
are
bound
to
meet
some
time
or
other
in
their
lives
if
not
entirely
true
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
this
comforting
theory
as
human
beings
of
similar
nature
seem
constantly
converging
as
by
some
magnetic
attraction
the
circle
to
which
miss
evans
now
happened
to
be
introduced
was
in
every
sense
congenial
and
inspiriting
bray
his
wife
and
his
were
a
trio
more
like
some
delightful
characters
in
a
novel
than
the
sober
inhabitants
of
a
warwickshire
country
town
living
in
a
house
beautifully
situated
on
the
outskirts
of
coventry
they
used
to
spend
their
lives
in
philosophical
speculations
philanthropy
and
pleasant
social
hospitality
joining
to
the
ease
and
of
continental
manners
a
thoroughly
english
geniality
and
trustworthiness
bray
was
a
wealthy
ribbon
manufacturer
but
had
become
engrossed
from
an
early
age
in
religious
and
metaphysical
speculation
as
well
as
in
political
and
social
questions
beginning
to
inquire
into
the
dogmas
which
formed
the
basis
of
his
belief
he
found
on
careful
investigation
that
they
did
not
stand
in
his
opinion
the
test
of
reason
his
arguments
set
his
charles
hennell
a
unitarian
to
examine
afresh
and
go
carefully
over
the
whole
ground
of
popular
theology
the
consequence
of
this
close
study
being
the
concerning
the
origin
of
christianity
a
work
which
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
when
it
appeared
and
was
translated
into
german
at
the
instance
of
david
strauss
it
was
published
in
a
few
years
after
the
appearance
of
the
of
jesus
in
its
critical
examination
of
the
miracles
and
in
the
sifting
of
mythological
from
historical
elements
in
the
gospels
it
bears
considerable
analogy
to
strauss
great
work
although
strictly
based
on
independent
studies
being
originally
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
solve
the
doubts
of
a
small
set
of
friends
their
doubts
were
solved
but
not
in
the
manner
originally
anticipated
bray
of
an
essentially
religious
nature
shared
the
opinions
of
her
husband
and
brother
and
without
conforming
to
the
external
rites
and
ceremonies
of
a
creed
led
a
life
of
saintly
purity
and
the
exquisite
beauty
of
her
moral
nature
not
only
attracted
marian
to
this
truly
amiable
woman
but
filled
her
with
reverence
and
the
friendship
then
commenced
was
only
ended
by
death
in
miss
sara
hennell
marian
evans
found
another
congenial
companion
who
became
as
a
sister
to
her
this
singular
being
in
most
respects
such
a
contrast
to
her
sister
nervous
excitable
importing
all
the
ardour
of
feeling
into
a
life
of
austere
thought
seemed
in
a
manner
mentally
to
totter
under
the
weight
of
her
own
immense
metaphysical
speculations
a
casual
acquaintance
of
these
two
young
ladies
might
perhaps
have
predicted
that
miss
hennell
was
the
one
destined
to
achieve
fame
in
the
future
and
she
certainly
must
have
been
an
extraordinary
mental
stimulus
to
her
young
friend
marian
these
gifted
sisters
two
of
a
family
all
the
members
of
which
were
remarkable
by
some
are
identified
as
the
originals
of
the
delightful
meyrick
household
in
deronda
each
member
of
this
genial
group

already
or
ultimately
became
an
author

more
or
less
repute

publications

years
ago

if
he
would
reduce
his
many
works
to
one
containing
nothing
unessential
he
would
doubtless
obtain
that
high
place
among
the
philosophers
of
our
country
to
which
his
powers
of
thought
entitle
him

most
popular

among

endeavoured
to
introduce

greater
degree
of

george
eliot
writing
to
bray
in
march
on
this
very
subject
says
a
very
good
as
well
as
very
rich
woman
s
has
founded
a
model
school
at
naples
and
has
the
sympathy
of
the
best
italians
in
her
educational
efforts
of
course
a
chief
point
in
trying
to
improve
the
italians
is
to
teach
them
kindness
to
animals
and
a
friend
of
s
has
confided
to
her
a
small
sum
of
money
fifty
pounds
i
think
to
be
applied
to
the
translation
and
publication
of
some
good
books
for
young
people
which
would
be
likely
to
rouse
in
them
a
sympathy
with
dumb
creatures
will
you
kindly
help
me
in
the
effort
to
further
s
good
work
by
sending
me
a
copy
of
your
book
on
animals
and
also
by
telling
me
the
periodical
in
which
the
parts
of
the
book
first
appeared
as
well
as
the
titles
of
any
other
works
which
you
think
would
be
worth
mentioning
for
the
purpose
in
question
s
as
indeed
you
may
probably
know
is
the
widow
of
a
german
merchant
of
manchester
as
rich
as
many
such
merchants
are
and
as
benevolent
as
only
the
choicest
few
she
knows
all
sorts
of
good
work
for
the
world
and
is
known
by
most
of
the
workers
it
struck
me
while
she
was
speaking
of
this
need
of
a
book
to
translate
that
you
had
done
the
very
thing
a
few
days
later
the
following
highly
interesting
letter
came
from
the
same
source
many
thanks
for
the
helpful
things
you
have
sent
me
wounded
bird
is
charming
but
now
something
very
much
larger
of
the
same
kind
must
be
written
and
you
are
the
person
to
write
it
something
that
will
bring
the
emotions
sufferings
and
possible
consolations
of
the
dear
brutes
vividly
home
to
the
imaginations
of
children
fitted
for
children
of
all
countries
as
reineke
fuchs
is
comprehensible
to
all
nations
a
rough
notion
came
to
me
the
other
day
of
supposing
a
house
of
refuge
not
only
for
dogs
but
for
all
distressed
animals
the
keeper
of
this
refuge
understands
the
language

all
this
is
not

except
to
make
you
feel
how
much
better
a

you
can
think
of

you
must
positively
write
this

everybody
wants

will

our
have
had
in
the
groaning

of
the
world
towards
the
birth
of
the
right
and
fair
but
you
must
not
do
it
without
the
of
labour
i
do
say
since
there
is
no
pay
for
good
work
let
be
blest
with
the
blessing
of
the
unscrupulous
i
want
to
contribute
something

helping

especially
the
southern
children
to
be
good
to
the
creatures
who
are
continually
at
their
mercy
i
ca
write
the
needed
book
myself
but
i
feel
sure
that
you
can
and
that
you
will
not
refuse
the
duty
bray
answer
to
this
humorous
suggestion
may
be
gathered
from
george
eliot
amiable
reply
i
see
at
once
that
you
must
be
right
about
the
necessity
for
being
simple
and
literal
in
fact
i
have
ridiculous
impulses
in
teaching
children
and
always
make
the
horizon
too
wide
wounded
bird
is
perfect
of
its
kind
and
that
kind
is
the
best
for
a
larger
work
you
yourself
see
clearly
that
it
is
an
exceptional
case
for
any
one
to
be
able
to
write
books
for
children
without
putting
in
them
false
morality
disguised
as
devout
religion
and
you
are
one
of
the
exceptional
cases
i
am
quite
sure
from
what
you
have
done
that
you
can
do
the
thing
which
is
still
wanted
to
be
done
as
to
imagination
wounded
bird
is
full
of
imagination
these
extracts
pleasantly
illustrate
both
the
writer
and
recipient
of
such
humane
letters
and
though
written
at
a
much
later
period
not
only
give
an
idea
of
the
nature
of
bray
literary
pursuits
but
of
the
friendly
relations
subsisting
to
the
end
between
her
and
george
eliot
of
miss
hennell
work
it
is
more
difficult
to
speak
without
entering
more
deeply
into
her
than
is
compatible
with
the
scope
of
the
present
work
in
one
of
her
best
known
books
entitled
in
aid
of
faith
she
makes
the
daring
attempt
to
trace
the
evolution
of
religion
her
mode
of
thought
partaking
at
once
of
the
scientific
and
the
mystical
for
the
present
she
seems
to
be
one
of
the
very
few
women
who
have
ventured
into
the
arena
of
philosophy
and
curiously
enough
her
doctrine
is
that
there
should
be
a
feminine
method
in
metaphysics
as
well
as
a
masculine
the
sexes
according
to
this
singular
theory
finding
their
counterpart
in
religion
and
science
it
may
be
remembered
that
george
eliot
in
one
of
her
essays
is
of
opinion
that
women
should
endeavour
to
make
some
distinctively
feminine
contributions
to
the
intellectual
pursuits
they
engage
in
saying
let
the
whole
field
of
reality
be
laid
open
to
woman
as
well
as
to
man
and
then
that
which
is
peculiar
in
her
mental
modification
instead
of
being
as
it
is
now
a
source
of
discord
and
repulsion
between
the
sexes
will
be
found
to
be
a
necessary
complement
to
the
truth
and
beauty
of
life
then
we
shall
have
that
marriage
of
minds
which
alone
can
blend
all
the
hues
of
thought
and
feeling
in
one
lovely
rainbow
of
promise
for
the
harvest
of
happiness
something
of
the
same
idea
lies
at
the
root
of
much
in
miss
mystical
disquisitions
this
circumstantial
account
of
the
circle
to
which
miss
evans
was
now
introduced
has
been
given
because
it
consisted
of
friends
who
more
than
any
others
helped
in
the
growth
and
formation
of
her
mind
no
human
being
indeed
can
be
fully
understood
without
some
knowledge
of
the
companions
that
at
one
time
or
other
but
especially
during
the
period
of
development
have
been
intimately
associated
with
his
or
her
life
however
vastly
a
mountain
may
appear
to
loom
above
us
from
the
plain
on
ascending
to
its
summit
one
always
finds
innumerable
lesser
eminences
which
all
help
in
making
up
the
one
imposing
central
effect
and
similarly
in
the
world
of
mind
many
superior
natures
in
varying
degrees
all
contribute
their
share
towards
the
maturing
of
that
exceptional
intellectual
product
whose
topmost
summit
is
genius
the
lady
who
first
introduced
marian
evans
to
the
brays
was
not
without
an
object
of
her
own
for
her
young
friend
whose
religious
fervour
tinged
with
evangelical
sentiment
was
as
conspicuous
as
her
unusual
learning
and
thoughtfulness
seemed
to
her
peculiarly
fitted
to
exercise
a
beneficial
influence
on
the
rosehill
household
where
generally
unorthodox
opinions
were
much
in
vogue
up
to
the
age
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
marian
had
been
considered
the
most
truly
pious
member
of
her
family
being
earnestly
bent
as
she
says
to
shape
this
anomalous
english
christian
life
of
ours
into
some
consistency
with
the
spirit
and
simple
verbal
tenor
of
the
new
testament
i
was
brought
up
she
informs
another
correspondent
in
the
church
of
england
and
have
never
joined
any
other
religious
society
but
i
have
had
close
acquaintance
with
many
dissenters
of
various
sects
from
calvinistic
anabaptists
to
unitarians
her
inner
life
at
this
time
is
faithfully
mirrored
in
the
spiritual
experiences
of
maggie
tulliver
marian
evans
was
not
one
who
could
rest
satisfied
with
outward
observances
and
she
needed
a
faith
which
should
give
unity
and
sanctity
to
the
conception
of
life
which
should
awaken
that
recognition
of
something
to
be
lived
for
beyond
the
mere
satisfaction
of
self
which
is
to
the
moral
life
what
the
addition
of
a
great
central
ganglion
is
to
animal
life
at
one
time
evangelicalism
supplied
her
with
the
most
essential
conditions
of
a
religious
life
with
all
the
vehemence
of
an
ardent
nature
she
flung
her
whole
soul
into
a
passionate
acceptance
of
the
teaching
of
christianity
carrying
her
zeal
to
the
pitch
of
asceticism
this
was
the
state
of
her
mind
at
the
age
of
seventeen
when
her
aunt
from
wirksworth
came
to
stay
with
her
elizabeth
evans
who
came
afterwards
to
be
largely
identified
with
dinah
morris
was
a
zealous
wesleyan
having
at
one
time
been
a
noted
preacher
but
her
niece
then
a
rigid
calvinist
hardly
thought
her
doctrine
strict
enough
when
this
same
aunt
paid
her
a
visit
some
years
afterwards
at
foleshill
marian
views
had
already
undergone
a
complete
transformation
and
their
intercourse
was
constrained
and
painful
for
the
young
evangelical
enthusiast
who
had
been
a
favourite
in
clerical
circles
was
now
in
what
she
afterwards
described
as
a
crude
state
of
freethinking
it
was
a
period
of
transition
through
which
she
gradually
passed
into
a
new
religious
synthesis
her
intimacy
with
the
brays
began
about
the
time
when
these
new
doubts
were
beginning
to
ferment
in
her
her
expanding
mind
nourished
on
the
best
literature
ancient
and
modern
began
to
feel
cramped
by
dogmas
that
had
now
lost
their
vitality
yet
a
break
with
an
inherited
form
of
belief
to
which
a
thousand
tender
associations
bound
her
was
a
catastrophe
she
shrank
from
with
dread
hence
a
period
of
mental
uncertainty
and
trouble
in
consequence
of
these
inward
questionings
it
happened
that
the
young
lady
who
had
been
unwittingly
brought
to
convert
her
new
acquaintances
was
converted
by
them
in
intercourse
with
them
she
was
able
freely
to
open
her
mind
their
enlightened
views
helping
her
in
this
crisis
of
her
spiritual
life
and
she
found
it
an
intense
relief
to
feel
no
longer
bound
to
reconcile
her
moral
and
intellectual
perceptions
with
a
particular
form
of
worship
the
antagonism
she
met
with
in
certain
quarters
the
social
persecution
from
which
she
had
much
to
suffer
are
perhaps
responsible
for
some
of
the
sharp
caustic
irony
with
which
she
afterwards
assailed
certain
theological
habits
of
thought
it
is
not
unlikely
that
in
some
of
her
essays
for
the
she
mainly
expressed
the
thoughts
which
were
stirred
in
her
by
the
opposition
she
encountered
at
this
period
of
her
life
as
for
example
in
the
brilliant
paper
entitled
and
otherworldliness
which
contains
such
a
scathing
passage
as
the
following
for
certain
other
elements
of
virtue
which
are
of
more
obvious
importance
to
untheological
minds
a
delicate
sense
of
our
rights
an
active
participation
in
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
our
a
magnanimous
acceptance
of
privation
or
suffering
for
ourselves
when
it
is
the
condition
of
good
to
others
in
a
word
the
extension
and
intensification
of
our
sympathetic
nature
we
think
it
of
some
importance
to
contend
that
they
have
no
more
direct
relation
to
the
belief
in
a
future
state
than
the
interchange
of
gases
in
the
lungs
has
to
the
plurality
of
worlds
nay
to
us
it
is
conceivable
that
to
some
minds
the
deep
pathos
lying
in
the
thought
of
human
mortality
that
we
are
here
for
a
little
while
and
then
vanish
away
that
this
earthly
life
is
all
that
is
given
to
our
loved
ones
and
to
our
many
suffering
lies
nearer
the
fountains
of
moral
emotion
than
the
conception
of
extended
existence
to
us
it
is
matter
of
unmixed
rejoicing
that
this
latter
necessity
of
healthful
life
is
independent
of
theological
ink
and
that
its
evolution
is
ensured
in
the
interaction
of
human
souls
as
certainly
as
the
evolution
of
science
or
of
art
with
which
indeed
it
is
but
a
twin
ray
melting
into
them
with
undefinable
limits
it
was
of
course
inevitable
that
her
changed
tone
of
mind
should
attract
the
attention
of
the
family
and
friends
of
marian
and
that
the
backsliding
of
so
exemplary
a
member
should
afford
matter
for
scandal
in
many
a
clerical
circle
and
evangelical
close
to
the
evanses
there
lived
at
that
time
a
dissenting
minister
whose
daughter
mary
was
a
particular
favourite
of
marian
evans
there
had
been
much
neighbourly
intimacy
between
the
two
young
ladies
and
though
there
was
only
five
years
difference
between
them
marian
always
inspired
her
friend
with
a
feeling
of
awe
at
her
intellectual
superiority
yet
her
sympathy
that
sympathy
with
all
human
life
which
was
the
strongest
element
of
her
character
was
even
then
so
irresistible
that
every
little
trouble
of
mary
life
was
entrusted
to
her
keeping
but
the
sudden
discovery
of
their
daughter
friend
being
an
infidel
came
with
the
shock
of
a
thunderclap
on
the
parents
much
hot
argument
passed
between
the
minister
and
this
youthful
controversialist
but
the
former
clinched
the
whole
question
by
a
triumphant
reference
to
the
dispersion
of
the
jews
throughout
the
world
as
an
irrefutable
proof
of
the
divine
inspiration
of
the
bible
in
spite
of
this
vital
difference
on
religious
questions
miss
evans
was
suffered
to
go
on
giving
the
minister
daughter
lessons
in
german
which
were
continued
for
two
or
three
years
she
having
generously
undertaken
this
labour
of
love
twice
a
week
because
she
judged
from
the
shape
of
her
young
friend
head
phrenology
being
rife
in
those
days
that
she
must
have
an
excellent
understanding
but
better
than
languages
she
taught
her
the
value
of
time
always
cutting
short
mere
random
talk
by
simply
ignoring
it
altogether
the
wonderful
strength
of
her
personality
manifested
itself
even
at
this
early
period
in
the
indelible
impression
it
left
on
her
pupil
memory
many
of
her
sayings
remaining
graven
on
it
as
on
stone
as
for
instance
when
one
day
twitting
mary
too
great
she
remarked
we
are
very
apt
to
measure
ourselves
by
our
aspiration
instead
of
our
performance
or
when
on
a
friend
asking
what
is
the
meaning
of
faust
she
replied
the
same
as
the
meaning
of
the
universe
while
reading
with
her
young
pupil
the
latter
happened
to
say
how
the
characters
seemed
do
say
exclaimed
marian
we
know
that
they
true
to
the
life
and
she
immediately
began
repeating
the
talk
of
labourers
farriers
butchers
and
others
of
that
class
with
such
close
imitation
as
to
startle
her
friend
is
not
this
a
of
the
inimitable
scene
at
the
by
far
the
most
trying
consequence
of
her
change
of
views
was
that
now
for
the
first
time
marian
was
brought
into
collision
with
her
father
whose
pet
she
had
always
been
he
could
not
understand
her
inward
perplexities
nor
the
need
of
her
soul
for
complete
inward
unity
of
thought
a
condition
impossible
to
her
under
the
limiting
conditions
of
a
dogmatic
evangelicalism
where
folly
often
mistakes
itself
for
wisdom
ignorance
gives
itself
airs
of
knowledge
and
selfishness
turning
its
eyes
upwards
calls
itself
religion
she
on
the
other
hand
after
a
painful
struggle
wanted
to
break
away
from
the
old
forms
of
worship
and
refused
to
go
to
church
deeply
attached
though
she
was
to
her
father
the
need
to
make
her
acts
conform
with
her
convictions
became
irresistible
under
such
conflicting
tendencies
a
rupture
between
father
and
daughter
became
imminent
and
for
a
short
time
a
breaking
up
of
the
home
was
contemplated
marian
intending
to
go
and
live
by
herself
in
coventry
one
of
the
leading
traits
in
her
nature
was
its
adhesiveness
however
and
the
threat
of
separation
proved
so
painful
to
her
that
her
friends
and
bray
persuaded
her
to
conform
to
her
father
wishes
as
far
as
outward
observances
were
implied
and
for
the
rest
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
inquire
into
her
thoughts
or
occupations
from
a
letter
written
at
this
period
it
appears
that
the
concerning
the
origin
of
christianity
had
made
a
most
powerful
impression
on
her
mind
indeed
she
dated
from
it
a
new
birth
but
so
earnest
and
conscientious
was
she
in
her
studies
that
before
beginning
its
perusal
she
and
a
friend
determined
to
read
the
bible
through
again
from
beginning
to
end
the
intimacy
between
the
inmates
of
rosehill
and
the
girl
student
at
foleshill
meanwhile
was
constantly
growing
closer
they
met
daily
and
in
their
midst
the
humorous
side
of
her
nature
expanded
no
less
than
her
intellect
although
striking
ordinary
acquaintances
by
an
abnormal
gravity
when
completely
at
her
ease
she
at
times
bubbled
over
with
fun
and
gaiety
irradiated
by
the
unexpected
flashes
of
a
wit
whose
full
scope
was
probably
as
yet
unsuspected
by
its
possessor
not
but
that
miss
evans
and
her
friends
must
have
been
conscious
even
at
that
early
age
of
extraordinary
powers
in
her
destined
some
day
to
give
her
a
conspicuous
position
in
the
world
for
her
conversation
was
already
so
full
of
charm
depth
and
comprehensiveness
that
all
talk
after
hers
seemed
stale
and
many
were
the
discussions
in
those
days
between
bray
and
marian
evans
and
though
frequently
broken
off
in
fierce
dispute
one
evening
they
always
began
again
quite
amicably
the
next
bray
probably
exercised
considerable
influence
on
his
young
friend
mind
at
this
impressible
period
of
life
perhaps
her
attention
to
philosophy
was
first
roused
by
acquaintance
with
him
and
his
varied
acquirements
in
this
department
may
have
helped
in
giving
a
positive
direction
to
her
own
thoughts
bray
was
just
then
working
out
his
of
necessity
the
problems
discussed
being
the
same
as
those
which
have
occupied
the
leading
thinkers
of
the
day
auguste
comte
in
his
philosophy
buckle
in
his
of
civilization
and
herbert
spencer
in
his
the
theory
that
as
an
individual
and
collectively
man
is
as
much
subject
to
law
as
any
of
the
other
entities
in
nature
was
one
of
those
magnificent
ideas
which
revolutionise
the
world
of
thought
many
minds
in
different
countries
of
different
calibre
were
all
trying
to
systematise
what
knowledge
there
was
on
this
subject
in
order
to
convert
hypothesis
into
demonstration
to
what
extent
bray
may
have
based
his
of
necessity
on
independent
research
or
how
much
was
merely
assimilated
from
contemporary
sources
we
can
not
here
inquire
enough
that
the
ideas
embodied
in
it
represented
some
of
the
most
vital
thought
of
the
age
and
contributed
therefore
not
a
little
to
the
formation
of
george
eliot
mind
and
to
the
grip
which
she
presently
displayed
in
the
handling
of
philosophical
topics
in
the
sensation
created
by
strauss
had
even
extended
to
so
remote
a
district
as
warwickshire
some
persons
of
advanced
opinions
deeply
impressed
by
its
penetrating
historical
criticism
which
was
in
fact
niebuhr
method
applied
to
the
elucidation
of
the
gospels
were
very
desirous
of
obtaining
an
english
translation
of
this
work
meeting
at
the
house
of
a
common
friend
the
late
joseph
parkes
of
birmingham
they
agreed
in
the
first
blush
of
their
enthusiasm
to
raise
amongst
them
whatever
sum
might
be
required
for
the
purpose
hennell
the
leading
spirit
in
this
enterprise
proposed
that
the
translation
should
be
undertaken
by
miss
brabant
the
accomplished
daughter
of
brabant
a
scholar
deeply
versed
in
theological
matters
who
was
in
friendly
correspondence
with
strauss
and
paulus
in
germany
and
with
coleridge
and
grote
in
england
the
lady
in
question
though
still
in
her
teens
was
peculiarly
fitted
for
the
task
as
she
had
already
translated
some
of
baur
erudite
writings
on
theological
subjects
into
english
but
when
she
had
done
about
one
half
of
the
first
volume
her
learned
labours
came
to
an
unexpected
conclusion
as
she
became
engaged
to
hennell
who
to
great
mental
attainments
joined
much
winning
buoyancy
of
manner
and
on
her
marriage
with
this
gentleman
she
had
to
relinquish
her
task
as
too
laborious
miss
brabant
acquaintance
with
marian
began
in
and
in
the
summer
of
that
year
the
whole
friendly
group
started
on
an
excursion
to
tenby
during
their
stay
at
this
the
lady
who
had
begun
and
the
lady
destined
eventually
to
accomplish
the
enormous
labour
of
translating
the
of
jesus
gave
tokens
of
feminine
frivolity
by
insisting
on
going
to
a
public
ball
where
however
they
were
disappointed
as
partners
were
very
scarce
it
should
be
remembered
that
marian
evans
was
only
years
old
at
this
time
but
though
she
had
not
yet
done
anything
her
friends
already
thought
her
a
wonderful
woman
she
never
seems
to
have
had
any
real
youthfulness
and
her
personal
appearance
greatly
improved
with
time
it
is
only
to
the
finest
natures
it
should
be
remembered
that
age
gives
an
added
beauty
and
distinction
for
the
most
persistent
self
has
then
worked
its
way
to
the
surface
having
modified
the
expression
and
to
some
extent
the
features
to
its
own
likeness
there
exists
a
coloured
sketch
done
by
bray
about
this
period
which
gives
one
a
glimpse
of
george
eliot
in
her
girlhood
in
those
foleshill
days
she
had
a
quantity
of
soft
hair
worn
in
ringlets
her
head
was
massive
her
features
powerful
and
rugged
her
mouth
large
but
shapely
the
jaw
singularly
square
for
a
woman
yet
having
a
certain
delicacy
of
outline
a
neutral
tone
of
colouring
did
not
help
to
relieve
this
general
heaviness
of
structure
the
complexion
being
pale
but
not
fair
nevertheless
the
play
of
expression
and
the
wonderful
mobility
of
the
mouth
which
increased
with
age
gave
a
womanly
softness
to
the
countenance
in
curious
contrast
with
its
framework
her
eyes
of
a
constantly
varying
in
colour
striking
some
as
intensely
blue
others
as
of
a
pale
grey
were
small
and
not
beautiful
in
themselves
but
when
she
grew
animated
in
conversation
those
eyes
lit
up
the
whole
face
seeming
in
a
manner
to
transfigure
it
so
much
was
this
the
case
that
a
young
lady
who
had
once
enjoyed
an
hour
conversation
with
her
came
away
under
its
spell
with
the
impression
that
she
was
beautiful
but
afterwards
on
seeing
george
eliot
again
when
she
was
not
talking
she
could
hardly
believe
her
to
be
the
same
person
the
charm
of
her
nature
disclosed
itself
in
her
manner
and
in
her
voice
the
latter
recalling
that
of
dorothea
in
being
like
the
voice
of
a
soul
that
has
once
lived
in
an
æolian
harp
it
was
low
and
deep
vibrating
with
sympathy
bray
an
enthusiastic
believer
in
phrenology
was
so
much
struck
with
the
grand
proportions
of
her
head
that
he
took
marian
evans
to
london
to
have
a
cast
taken
he
thinks
that
after
that
of
napoleon
her
head
showed
the
largest
development
from
brow
to
ear
of
any
recorded
the
similarity
of
type
between
george
eliot
face
and
savonarola
has
been
frequently
pointed
out
some
affinity
in
their
natures
may
have
led
her
if
unconsciously
to
select
that
epoch
of
florentine
life
in
which
he
played
so
prominent
a
part
though
not
above
the
middle
height
marian
gave
people
the
impression
of
being
much
taller
than
she
really
was
her
figure
although
thin
and
slight
being
and
not
without
a
certain
sturdiness
of
make
she
was
never
robust
in
health
being
delicately
strung
and
of
a
highly
nervous
temperament
in
youth
the
keen
excitability
of
her
nature
often
made
her
wayward
and
hysterical
in
fact
her
extraordinary
intellectual
vigour
did
not
exclude
the
susceptibilities
and
weaknesses
of
a
peculiarly
feminine
organisation
with
all
her
mental
activity
she
yet
led
an
intensely
emotional
life
a
life
which
must
have
held
hidden
trials
for
her
as
in
those
days
she
was
known
by
her
friends
to
weep
bucketfuls
of
tears
a
woman
of
strong
passions
like
her
own
maggie
deeply
affectionate
by
nature
of
a
clinging
tenderness
of
disposition
marian
evans
went
through
much
inward
struggle
through
many
painful
experiences
before
she
reached
the
moral
of
her
later
years
had
she
not
it
is
hardly
likely
that
she
could
have
entered
with
so
deep
a
comprehension
into
the
most
intricate
windings
of
the
human
heart
that
of
course
was
to
a
great
extent
due
to
her
sympathy
sympathy
being
the
strongest
quality
of
her
moral
nature
she
flung
herself
as
it
were
into
other
lives
making
their
affairs
their
hopes
their
sorrows
her
own
and
this
power
of
identifying
herself
with
the
people
she
came
near
had
the
effect
of
a
magnet
in
attracting
her
if
friends
went
to
her
in
their
trouble
they
would
find
not
only
that
she
entered
with
deep
feeling
into
their
most
minute
concerns
but
that
by
gradual
degrees
she
lifted
them
beyond
their
personal
distress
and
that
they
would
leave
her
presence
in
an
ennobled
and
elevated
frame
of
mind
this
sympathy
was
closely
connected
with
her
faculty
of
detecting
and
responding
to
anything
that
showed
the
smallest
sign
of
intellectual
vitality
she
essentially
resembled
socrates
in
her
manner
of
eliciting
whatsoever
capacity
for
thought
might
be
latent
in
the
people
she
came
in
contact
with
were
it
only
a
shoemaker
or
she
would
never
rest
till
she
had
found
out
in
what
points
that
particular
man
differed
from
other
men
of
his
class
she
always
rather
educed
what
was
in
others
than
impressed
herself
on
them
showing
much
kindliness
of
heart
in
drawing
out
people
who
were
shy
sympathy
was
the
of
her
nature
the
source
of
her
iridescent
humour
of
her
subtle
knowledge
of
character
and
of
her
dramatic
genius
chapter
iv
translation
of
strauss
and
tour
on
the
continent
miss
brabant
marriage
to
charles
hennell
occurred
some
months
after
this
excursion
to
tenby
in
the
meanwhile
it
was
settled
that
miss
evans
should
continue
her
translation
of
strauss
thus
her
first
introduction
to
literature
was
in
a
sense
accidental
the
result
proved
her
admirably
fitted
for
the
task
for
her
version
of
this
searching
and
voluminous
work
remains
a
masterpiece
of
clear
nervous
english
at
the
same
time
faithfully
rendering
the
spirit
of
the
original
but
it
was
a
vast
and
laborious
undertaking
requiring
a
large
share
of
patience
will
and
energy
quite
apart
from
the
necessary
mental
qualifications
on
this
occasion
to
fit
herself
more
fully
for
her
weighty
task
marian
taught
herself
a
considerable
amount
of
hebrew
but
she
groaned
at
times
under
the
pressure
of
the
toil
which
had
necessarily
to
be
endured
feeling
tempted
to
relinquish
what
must
often
have
seemed
almost
intolerable
drudgery
the
active
interest
and
encouragement
of
her
friends
however
tided
her
over
these
moments
of
discouragement
and
after
three
years
of
assiduous
application
the
translation
was
finally
completed
and
brought
out
by
then
john
chapman
in
it
is
probably
safe
to
assume
that
the
composition
of
none
of
her
novels
cost
george
eliot
half
the
effort
and
toil
which
this
translation
had
done
yet
so
badly
is
this
kind
of
literary
work
remunerated
that
twenty
pounds
was
the
sum
paid
for
what
had
cost
three
years
of
hard
labour
indeed
by
this
time
most
of
the
twelve
friends
who
had
originally
guaranteed
the
sum
necessary
for
the
translation
and
publication
of
the
of
jesus
had
conveniently
forgotten
the
matter
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
generosity
of
joseph
parkes
who
volunteered
to
advance
the
necessary
funds
who
knows
how
long
the
translation
might
have
lain
dormant
in
a
drawer
at
foleshill
it
no
sooner
saw
the
light
however
than
every
one
recognised
the
exceptional
merits
of
the
work
and
for
several
years
afterwards
miss
evans
continued
to
be
chiefly
known
as
the
translator
of
strauss
soon
after
relieving
miss
brabant
from
the
task
of
translation
miss
evans
went
to
stay
for
a
time
with
her
friend
father
brabant
who
sadly
felt
the
loss
of
his
daughter
intelligent
and
enlivening
companionship
no
doubt
the
society
of
this
accomplished
scholar
described
by
grote
as
a
vigorous
intellect
was
no
less
congenial
than
instructive
to
his
young
companion
while
her
singular
mental
acuteness
and
affectionate
womanly
ways
were
most
grateful
to
the
lonely
old
man
there
is
something
very
attractive
in
this
episode
of
george
eliot
life
it
recalls
a
frequently
recurring
situation
in
her
novels
particularly
that
touching
one
of
the
devotion
with
which
the
ardent
romola
throws
herself
into
her
afflicted
father
learned
and
recondite
pursuits
there
exists
a
letter
written
to
an
intimate
friend
in
soon
after
the
translation
of
strauss
was
finished
which
i
should
say
already
shows
the
future
novelist
in
embryo
in
this
delightfully
humorous
mystification
of
her
friends
miss
evans
pretends
that
to
her
gratification
she
has
actually
had
a
visit
from
a
real
live
german
professor
whose
musty
person
was
encased
in
a
still
mustier
coat
this
learned
personage
has
come
over
to
england
with
the
single
purpose
of
getting
his
voluminous
writings
translated
into
english
there
are
at
least
twenty
volumes
all
unpublished
owing
to
the
envious
machinations
of
rival
authors
none
of
them
treating
of
anything
more
modern
than
cheops
or
the
invention
of
the
hieroglyphics
the
respectable
professor
object
in
coming
to
england
is
to
secure
a
wife
and
translator
in
one
but
though
on
inquiry
he
finds
that
the
ladies
engaged
in
translation
are
legion
they
mostly
turn
out
to
be
utterly
incompetent
besides
not
answering
to
his
requirements
in
other
respects
the
qualifications
he
looks
for
in
a
wife
besides
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
english
and
german
being
personal
ugliness
and
a
snug
little
capital
sufficient
to
supply
him
with
a
moderate
allowance
of
tobacco
and
after
defraying
the
expense
of
printing
his
books
to
find
this
phoenix
among
women
he
is
sent
to
coventry
on
all
hands
in
miss
evans
so
she
runs
on
the
aspiring
professor
finds
his
utmost
wishes
realised
and
so
proposes
to
her
on
the
spot
thinking
that
it
may
be
her
last
chance
she
accepts
him
with
equal
celerity
and
her
father
although
strongly
objecting
to
a
foreigner
is
induced
to
give
his
consent
for
the
same
reason
the
lady
only
stipulation
is
that
her
future
husband
shall
take
her
out
of
england
with
its
dreary
climate
and
drearier
inhabitants
this
being
settled
she
invites
her
friends
to
come
to
her
wedding
which
is
to
take
place
next
week
this
lively
little
is
written
in
the
wittiest
manner
and
one
can
not
help
fancying
that
this
german
dryasdust
contained
the
germ
of
one
of
her
very
subtlest
masterpieces
in
characterisation
that
of
the
casaubon
the
very
sysiphus
of
authors
in
the
lady
too
willing
to
marry
her
suitor
for
the
sake
of
in
his
abstruse
mental
labours
we
have
a
faint
adumbration
of
the
dorothea
but
these
sudden
stirrings
at
original
invention
did
not
prevent
miss
evans
from
undertaking
another
task
similar
to
her
last
if
not
so
laborious
she
now
set
about
translating
ludwig
feuerbach
des
this
daring
philosopher
who
kept
aloof
from
professional
honours
and
dwelt
apart
in
a
wood
that
he
might
be
free
to
handle
questions
of
theology
and
metaphysics
with
absolute
fearlessness
had
created
a
great
sensation
by
his
philosophical
criticism
in
germany
unlike
his
countrymen
whose
writings
on
these
subjects
are
usually
enveloped
in
such
an
impenetrable
mist
that
their
most
perilous
ideas
pass
harmlessly
over
the
heads
of
the
multitude
feuerbach
by
his
keen
incisiveness
of
language
and
luminousness
of
exposition
was
calculated
to
bring
his
meaning
home
to
the
average
reader
garnett
account
of
the
of
christianity
in
the
britannica
admirably
concise
as
it
is
may
be
quoted
here
as
conveying
in
the
fewest
words
the
gist
of
this
famous
treatise
where
feuerbach
shows
that
every
article
of
christian
belief
corresponds
to
some
instinct
or
necessity
of
man
nature
from
which
he
infers
that
it
is
the
creation
and
embodiment
of
some
human
wish
hope
or
apprehension
following
up
the
hint
of
one
of
the
oldest
greek
philosophers
he
demonstrates
that
religious
ideas
have
their
counterparts
in
human
nature
and
assumes
that
they
must
be
its
product
the
translation
of
the
of
christianity
was
also
published
by
chapman
in
it
appeared
in
his
series
destined
to
consist
of
works
by
learned
and
profound
thinkers
embracing
the
subjects
of
theology
philosophy
biblical
criticism
and
the
history
of
opinion
probably
because
her
former
translation
had
been
so
eminently
successful
miss
evans
received
fifty
pounds
for
her
present
work
but
there
was
no
demand
for
it
in
england
and
chapman
lost
heavily
by
its
publication
about
the
same
period
miss
evans
also
translated
spinoza
for
the
benefit
of
an
inquiring
friend
but
her
english
version
of
the
was
not
undertaken
till
the
year
after
she
had
left
her
home
at
foleshill
in
applying
herself
to
the
severe
labour
of
rendering
one
philosophical
work
after
another
into
english
miss
evans
no
doubt
was
bent
on
elucidating
for
herself
some
of
the
most
vital
problems
which
engage
the
mind
when
once
it
has
shaken
itself
free
from
purely
traditional
beliefs
rather
than
on
securing
for
herself
any
pecuniary
advantages
but
her
admirable
translations
attracted
the
attention
of
the
and
she
became
gradually
known
to
some
of
the
most
distinguished
men
of
the
time
unfortunately
her
father
health
now
began
to
fail
causing
her
no
little
pain
and
anxiety
at
some
period
during
his
illness
she
stayed
with
him
in
the
isle
of
wight
for
in
a
letter
to
bray
written
many
years
afterwards
she
says
the
charles
grandison
you
are
reading
must
be
the
series
of
little
fat
volumes
you
lent
me
to
carry
to
the
isle
of
wight
where
i
read
it
at
every
interval
when
my
father
did
not
want
me
and
was
sorry
that
the
long
novel
was
not
longer
it
is
a
solace
to
hear
of
any
one
reading
and
enjoying
richardson
we
have
fallen
on
an
evil
generation
who
would
not
read
even
in
an
abridged
form
the
french
have
been
its
most
enthusiastic
admirers
but
i
do
know
whether
their
present
admiration
is
more
than
traditional
like
their
set
phrases
about
their
own
classics
during
the
last
year
of
her
father
life
his
daughter
was
also
in
the
habit
of
reading
scott
novels
aloud
to
him
for
several
hours
of
each
day
she
must
thus
have
become
deeply
versed
in
his
manner
of
telling
the
stories
in
which
she
continued
to
delight
all
her
life
and
in
speaking
of
the
widening
of
our
sympathies
which
a
picture
of
human
life
by
a
great
artist
is
calculated
to
produce
even
in
the
most
trivial
and
selfish
she
gives
as
an
instance
scott
description
of
luckie
mucklebackit
cottage
and
his
story
of
the
drovers
but
a
heavy
loss
now
befell
marian
evans
in
the
death
of
her
father
which
occurred
in
long
afterwards
nothing
seemed
to
afford
consolation
to
her
grief
for
eight
years
these
two
had
kept
house
together
and
the
deepest
mutual
affection
had
always
subsisted
between
them
marian
ever
treasured
her
father
memory
as
george
eliot
she
loved
to
recall
in
her
works
everything
associated
with
him
in
her
childhood
those
happy
times
when
standing
between
her
father
knees
she
used
to
be
driven
by
him
to
outlying
hamlets
whose
groups
of
inhabitants
were
as
distinctive
to
my
imagination
as
if
they
belonged
to
different
regions
of
the
globe
miss
evans
however
was
not
suffered
to
mourn
uncomforted
the
tender
friends
who
cared
for
her
as
a
sister
now
planned
a
tour
to
the
continent
in
hopes
that
the
change
of
scene
and
associations
would
soften
her
grief
so
they
started
on
their
travels
going
to
switzerland
and
italy
by
the
approved
route
which
in
those
days
was
not
so
hackneyed
as
it
now
is
to
so
penetrating
an
observer
as
miss
evans
there
must
have
been
an
infinite
interest
in
this
first
sight
of
the
continent
but
the
journey
did
not
seem
to
dispel
her
grief
and
she
continued
in
such
very
low
spirits
that
bray
almost
regretted
having
taken
her
abroad
so
soon
after
her
bereavement
her
terror
too
at
the
giddy
passes
which
they
had
to
cross
with
precipices
yawning
on
either
hand
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
false
step
must
send
them
rolling
into
the
abyss
was
so
overpowering
that
the
sublime
spectacle
of
the
alps
seemed
comparatively
to
produce
but
little
impression
on
her
her
moral
triumph
over
this
constitutional
timidity
when
any
special
occasion
arose
was
all
the
more
remarkable
one
day
when
crossing
the
col
de
balme
from
martigny
to
chamounix
one
of
the
was
found
to
be
badly
fitted
and
would
keep
turning
round
to
the
risk
of
the
rider
if
not
very
careful
slipping
off
at
any
moment
marian
however
insisted
on
having
this
defective
saddle
in
spite
of
the
protest
of
bray
who
felt
quite
guilty
whenever
they
came
to
any
perilous
places
how
different
is
this
timidity
from
george
sand
hardy
spirit
of
enterprise
no
one
who
has
read
that
captivating
book
her
can
forget
the
great
frenchwoman
description
of
a
swiss
expedition
during
which
while
encumbered
with
two
young
children
she
seems
to
have
borne
all
the
perils
fatigues
and
privations
of
a
toilsome
ascent
with
the
hardihood
of
a
mountaineer
but
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
although
miss
evans
was
just
then
in
a
peculiarly
nervous
and
excitable
condition
and
her
frequent
fits
of
weeping
were
a
source
of
pain
to
her
anxious
she
had
in
fact
been
so
assiduous
in
attendance
on
her
sick
father
that
she
was
physically
broken
down
for
a
time
under
these
circumstances
an
immediate
return
to
england
seemed
unadvisable
and
when
her
friends
started
on
their
homeward
journey
it
was
decided
that
marian
should
remain
behind
at
geneva
here
amid
scenes
so
intimately
associated
with
genius
where
the
sophist
wild
rousseau
placed
the
home
of
his
and
the
octogenarian
voltaire
spent
the
serene
indian
summer
of
his
stirring
career
where
gibbon
wrote
his
of
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
where
byron
and
shelley
sought
refuge
from
the
hatred
of
their
countrymen
and
which
madame
de
staël
complainingly
exchanged
for
her
beloved
rue
du
bac
here
the
future
author
of
and
gradually
recovered
under
the
sublime
influences
of
nature
healing
beauties
for
about
eight
months
miss
evans
lived
at
a
le
plongeau
near
geneva
but
she
was
glad
to
find
a
quieter
retreat
in
the
family
of
an
artist
becoming
much
attached
to
him
and
his
wife
established
in
one
of
the
lofty
upper
stories
of
this
pleasant
house
with
the
blue
shimmering
waters
of
the
lake
glancing
far
below
and
the
awful
heights
of
mont
blanc
solemnly
dominating
the
entire
landscape
she
not
only
loved
to
prosecute
her
studies
but
in
isolation
from
mankind
to
plan
glorious
schemes
for
their
welfare
during
this
stay
she
drank
deep
of
rousseau
whose
works
especially
made
an
indelible
impression
on
her
and
when
inciting
a
friend
to
study
french
she
remarked
that
it
was
worth
learning
that
language
if
only
to
read
him
at
the
same
period
marian
probably
became
familiarised
with
the
magnificent
social
utopias
of
simon
proudhon
and
other
french
writers
having
undergone
a
kind
of
mental
revolution
herself
not
so
long
ago
she
must
have
felt
some
sympathy
with
the
thrilling
hopes
of
liberty
which
had
agitated
the
states
of
western
europe
in
but
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
her
nature
had
conservative
leanings
she
believed
in
progress
only
as
the
result
of
evolution
not
revolution
and
in
one
of
her
most
incisive
essays
entitled
national
history
of
german
life
she
finely
points
out
the
notable
failure
of
revolutionary
attempts
conducted
from
the
point
of
view
of
abstract
democratic
and
socialistic
theories
in
the
same
article
she
draws
a
striking
parallel
between
the
growth
of
language
and
that
of
political
institutions
contending
that
it
would
be
as
unsatisfactory
to
construct
a
universal
language
on
a
rational
basis
one
that
had
no
uncertainty
no
whims
of
idiom
no
cumbrous
forms
no
fitful
shimmer
of
significance
no
hoary
archaisms
with
forgotten
years
as
abruptly
to
alter
forms
of
government
which
are
nothing
in
fact
but
the
result
of
historical
growth
systematically
embodied
by
society
besides
the
fascinations
of
study
and
the
outward
glory
of
nature
the
charm
of
social
intercourse
was
not
wanting
to
this
life
at
geneva
in
a
very
superior
man
gentle
refined
and
of
unusual
mental
attainments
she
found
a
highly
desirable
daily
companion
he
was
an
artist
by
profession
and
it
is
whispered
that
he
suggested
some
of
the
traits
in
the
character
of
the
philip
wakem
in
the
on
the
floss
the
only
portrait
in
oils
which
exists
of
george
eliot
is
one
painted
by
at
this
interesting
time
of
her
life
she
inspired
him
like
most
people
who
came
into
personal
contact
with
her
with
the
utmost
admiration
and
regard
and
wishing
to
be
of
some
service
he
escorted
miss
evans
to
england
on
her
return
thither
curiously
enough
subsequently
translated
one
of
her
works
probably
bede
without
in
the
least
suspecting
who
its
real
author
was
it
is
always
a
shock
when
vital
changes
have
occurred
in
individual
lot
to
return
to
a
place
after
an
absence
of
some
duration
to
find
it
wearing
the
same
unchangeable
aspect
one
expects
somehow
that
fields
and
streets
and
houses
would
show
some
alteration
corresponding
to
that
within
ourselves
but
already
from
a
distance
the
twin
spires
of
coventry
familiar
as
household
words
to
the
warwickshire
girl
greeted
the
eyes
of
the
returning
traveller
in
spite
of
all
love
for
her
native
spot
of
earth
this
was
a
heavy
time
to
marian
evans
her
father
was
dead
the
home
where
she
had
dwelt
as
mistress
for
so
many
years
broken
up
the
present
appearing
blank
and
comfortless
the
future
uncertain
and
vaguely
terrifying
the
question
now
was
where
she
should
live
what
she
should
do
to
what
purposes
turn
the
genius
whose
untried
and
partially
unsuspected
powers
were
darkly
agitating
her
whole
being
as
has
been
already
said
marian
evans
had
a
highly
complex
nature
compounded
of
many
contradictory
impulses
which
though
gradually
brought
into
harmony
as
life
matured
were
always
pulling
her
in
those
days
in
different
directions
thus
though
she
possessed
strong
family
affections
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
to
go
and
take
up
her
abode
in
the
house
of
some
relative
where
life
resolved
itself
into
a
monotonous
recurrence
of
petty
considerations
something
after
the
glegg
pattern
would
be
little
short
of
crucifixion
to
her
and
however
deep
her
attachment
for
her
native
soil
may
have
been
she
yet
sighed
passionately
to
break
away
from
its
associations
and
to
become
a
wanderer
and
a
pilgrim
on
the
face
of
the
earth
for
some
little
time
after
her
return
from
abroad
marian
took
up
her
residence
with
her
brother
and
his
family
but
the
children
who
had
toddled
in
the
fields
together
had
now
diverged
so
widely
that
no
memories
of
a
mutual
past
could
bridge
over
the
chasm
that
divided
them
under
these
circumstances
the
family
at
rosehill
pressed
her
to
make
their
home
permanently
hers
and
for
about
a
year
from
to
she
became
the
member
of
a
household
in
fullest
sympathy
with
her
here
bray
mental
activity
and
genial
brightness
of
disposition
and
his
wife
exquisite
goodness
of
heart
must
have
helped
to
soothe
and
cheer
one
whose
delicately
strung
nature
was
just
then
nearly
bending
under
the
excessive
strain
of
thought
and
feeling
she
had
gone
through
one
person
indeed
was
so
struck
by
the
grave
sadness
generally
affecting
her
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
her
coming
took
all
the
sunshine
out
of
the
day
but
whether
grave
or
gay
whether
meditative
or
playful
her
conversation
exercised
a
spell
over
all
who
came
within
its
reach
in
the
pleasant
house
at
rosehill
distinguished
guests
were
constantly
coming
and
going
so
that
there
was
no
lack
of
the
needed
intellectual
friction
supplied
by
clever
and
original
talk
here
in
a
pleasant
garden
planted
with
rustling
acacia
trees
and
opening
on
a
wide
prospect
of
undulating
country
with
the
fitful
brightness
of
english
skies
overhead
and
a
lawn
to
walk
or
recline
upon
many
were
the
topics
discussed
by
men
who
had
made
or
were
about
to
make
their
mark
froude
was
known
there
george
combe
discussed
with
his
host
the
principles
of
phrenology
at
that
time
claiming
its
thousands
of
disciples
ralph
waldo
emerson
on
a
lecturing
tour
in
this
country
while
on
a
brief
visit
made
acquaintance
and
was
observed
by
bray
engaged
in
eager
talk
with
her
suddenly
she
saw
him
start
something
said
by
this
quiet
girl
had
evidently
given
him
a
shock
of
surprise
afterwards
in
conversation
with
her
friends
he
spoke
of
her
great
calm
soul
this
is
no
doubt
an
instance
of
the
intense
sympathetic
adaptiveness
of
miss
evans
if
great
she
was
not
by
any
means
calm
at
this
period
but
inwardly
deeply
perturbed
yet
her
nature
with
subtlest
response
reflected
the
transcendental
calm
of
the
philosopher
when
brought
within
his
atmosphere
george
dawson
the
popular
lecturer
and
mr
flower
were
more
intimately
associated
with
the
rosehill
household
the
latter
then
living
at
where
he
was
wont
to
entertain
a
vast
number
of
people
especially
americans
who
make
pilgrimages
to
shakespeare
birthplace
is
known
to
the
world
as
the
benevolent
denouncer
of
bits
and
one
day
this
whole
party
went
to
hear
george
dawson
who
had
made
a
great
sensation
at
birmingham
preach
one
of
his
thrilling
sermons
from
the
text
and
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
george
eliot
alluding
to
these
days
as
late
as
says
in
a
letter
to
bray
george
dawson
was
strongly
associated
for
me
with
rosehill
not
to
speak
of
the
general
baptist
chapel
where
we
all
heard
him
preach
for
the
first
time
to
us
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
an
evening
when
and
f
dined
at
your
house
with
george
dawson
when
he
was
going
to
lecture
at
the
mechanics
institute
and
you
felt
compassionately
towards
him
because
you
thought
the
rather
riotous
talk
was
a
bad
preface
to
his
lecture
we
have
a
birmingham
friend
whose
acquaintance
we
made
many
years
ago
in
weimar
and
from
him
i
have
occasionally
had
some
news
of
dawson
i
feared
what
you
mention
that
his
life
has
been
a
little
too
strenuous
in
these
latter
years
on
the
evening
alluded
to
in
this
letter
dawson
was
dining
at
bray
house
before
giving
his
lecture
on
wesley
at
the
mechanics
institute
his
rich
sarcasm
and
love
of
fun
had
exhilarated
the
whole
company
and
not
content
with
merely
riotous
talk
george
dawson
and
mr
flower
turned
themselves
into
lions
and
wild
cats
for
the
amusement
of
the
children
suddenly
pouncing
out
from
under
the
with
hideous
roarings
and
screechings
till
the
hubbub
became
appalling
joined
to
the
delighted
exclamations
of
the
little
ones
dawson
did
the
lions
and
mr
flower
who
had
made
personal
acquaintance
with
the
wild
cats
in
the
backwoods
of
america
was
inimitable
in
their
peculiar
pounce
and
screech
thus
amid
studies
and
pleasant
friendly
intercourse
did
the
days
pass
at
rosehill
still
marian
evans
was
restless
tormented
frequently
in
tears
perhaps
unconsciously
craving
a
wider
sphere
and
more
definitely
recognised
position
however
strenuously
she
at
a
maturer
time
of
life
inculcated
the
necessity
of
resignation
she
had
not
then
learned
to
resign
herself
and
now
a
change
was
impending
a
change
which
fraught
with
the
most
important
consequences
was
destined
to
give
a
new
direction
to
the
current
of
her
life
john
chapman
invited
her
to
assist
him
in
the
editorship
of
the
which
passed
at
that
time
into
his
hands
from
john
mill
they
had
already
met
when
marian
was
passing
through
london
on
her
way
to
the
continent
on
some
matter
of
business
or
other
connected
with
one
of
her
translations
chapman
proposition
was
accepted
and
although
marian
suffered
keenly
from
the
wrench
of
parting
with
her
friends
the
prompting
to
work
out
her
powers
to
the
full
overcame
the
clinging
of
affection
and
in
the
spring
of
she
left
rosehill
behind
her
and
came
to
london
chapter
the
review
and
chapman
were
at
this
time
in
the
habit
of
admitting
a
few
select
boarders
chiefly
engaged
in
literary
pursuits
to
their
large
house
in
the
strand
and
miss
evans
at
their
invitation
made
her
home
with
them
thus
she
found
herself
at
once
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
consisting
of
some
of
the
most
advanced
thinkers
and
brilliant
of
the
day
a
circle
which
partly
consisting
of
contributors
to
the
was
strongly
imbued
with
scientific
tendencies
being
particularly
partial
to
the
doctrines
of
positive
philosophy
those
were
in
truth
the
palmy
days
of
the
herbert
spencer
lewes
john
oxenford
james
and
harriet
martineau
charles
bray
george
combe
and
professor
edward
forbes
were
among
the
writers
that
made
it
the
leading
expositor
of
the
philosophic
and
scientific
thought
of
the
age
it
occupied
a
position
something
midway
between
that
of
the
and
the
scorning
like
the
latter
to
pander
to
the
frivolous
tastes
of
the
majority
it
appealed
to
the
most
thoughtful
and
enlightened
section
of
the
reading
public
giving
especial
prominence
to
the
philosophy
of
the
comtist
school
and
while
not
so
fashionable
as
the
it
could
boast
among
its
contributors
names
quite
as
famous
destined
as
they
were
to
become
the
foremost
of
their
time
and
country
with
this
group
of
illustrious
writers
miss
evans
was
now
associated
and
the
articles
she
contributed
from
the
year
to
are
among
the
most
brilliant
examples
of
periodical
literature
the
first
notice
by
her
pen
is
a
brief
review
of
carlyle
of
sterling
for
january
and
judging
from
internal
evidence
as
regards
style
and
method
of
treatment
the
one
on
margaret
fuller
in
the
next
number
must
be
by
the
same
hand
to
the
biographer
there
is
a
curious
interest
in
what
she
says
in
her
first
notice
about
this
kind
of
literature
and
it
would
be
well
for
the
world
if
writers
were
to
lay
it
more
generally
to
heart
we
have
often
wished
that
genius
would
incline
itself
more
frequently
to
the
task
of
the
biographer
that
when
some
great
or
good
personage
dies
instead
of
the
dreary
compilations
of
letter
and
diary
and
detail
little
to
the
purpose
which
of
the
public
have
not
the
chance
nor
the
other
third
the
inclination
to
read
we
could
have
a
real
life
setting
forth
briefly
and
vividly
the
man
inward
and
outward
struggles
aims
and
achievements
so
as
to
make
clear
the
meaning
which
his
experience
has
for
his
fellows
a
few
such
lives
chiefly
autobiographies
the
world
possesses
and
they
have
perhaps
been
more
influential
on
the
formation
of
character
than
any
other
kind
of
reading
then
again
speaking
of
the
of
margaret
fuller
she
remarks
in
reference
to
the
same
topic
the
biographies
present
their
subjects
generally
as
broken
fragments
of
humanity
noticeable
because
of
their
individual
peculiarities
the
biographies
present
their
subjects
rather
as
organic
portions
of
society
george
eliot
estimate
of
margaret
fuller
for
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
it
is
hers
possesses
too
rare
an
interest
for
readers
not
to
be
given
here
in
her
own
apposite
and
pungent
words
we
are
at
a
loss
whether
to
regard
her
as
the
parent
or
child
of
new
england
transcendentalism
perhaps
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
it
was
essentially
an
intellectual
moral
spiritual
regeneration
a
renewing
of
the
whole
man
a
kindling
of
his
aspirations
after
full
development
of
faculty
and
perfect
symmetry
of
being
of
this
sect
margaret
fuller
was
the
priestess
in
conversation
she
was
as
copious
and
oracular
as
coleridge
brilliant
as
sterling
pungent
and
paradoxical
as
carlyle
gifted
with
the
inspired
powers
of
a
pythoness
she
saw
into
the
hearts
and
over
the
heads
of
all
who
came
near
her
and
but
for
a
sympathy
as
boundless
as
her
she
would
have
despised
the
whole
human
race
her
frailty
in
this
respect
was
no
secret
either
to
herself
or
her
friends
we
must
say
that
from
the
time
she
became
a
mother
till
the
final
tragedy
when
she
perished
with
her
husband
and
child
within
sight
of
her
native
shore
she
was
an
altered
woman
and
evinced
a
greatness
of
soul
and
heroism
of
character
so
grand
and
subduing
that
we
feel
disposed
to
extend
to
her
whole
career
the
admiration
and
sympathy
inspired
by
the
closing
scenes
while
her
reputation
was
at
its
height
in
the
literary
circles
of
boston
and
new
york
she
was
so
that
her
life
seemed
to
be
a
studied
act
rather
than
a
spontaneous
growth
but
this
was
the
mere
flutter
on
the
surface
the
well
was
deep
and
the
spring
genuine
and
it
is
creditable
to
her
friends
as
well
as
to
herself
that
such
at
all
times
was
their
belief
in
this
striking
of
a
character
the
penetrating
observer
of
human
nature
taking
in
at
a
glance
and
depicting
by
a
few
masterly
touches
all
that
helps
to
make
up
a
picture
of
the
real
living
being
begins
to
reveal
herself
these
essays
in
the
are
not
only
capital
reading
in
themselves
but
are
of
course
doubly
attractive
to
us
because
they
let
out
opinions
views
judgments
of
things
and
authors
which
we
should
never
otherwise
have
known
marian
evans
had
not
yet
hidden
herself
behind
the
mask
of
george
eliot
and
in
many
of
these
wise
and
witty
utterances
of
hers
we
are
admitted
behind
the
scenes
of
her
mind
so
to
speak
and
see
her
in
her
own
undisguised
person
before
she
had
assumed
the
of
the
novelist
showing
herself
to
the
world
mainly
through
her
dramatic
impersonations
in
these
articles
written
in
the
fresh
maturity
of
her
powers
we
learn
what
george
eliot
thought
about
many
subjects
we
learn
who
were
her
favourite
authors
in
fiction
what
opinions
she
held
on
art
and
poetry
what
was
her
attitude
towards
the
political
and
social
questions
of
the
day
what
was
her
conception
of
human
life
in
general
there
is
much
here
no
doubt
that
one
might
have
been
prepared
to
find
but
a
good
deal
too
that
comes
upon
one
with
the
freshness
of
surprise
a
special
interest
attaches
naturally
to
what
she
has
to
say
about
her
own
branch
of
art
the
novel
though
she
had
probably
no
idea
that
she
was
herself
destined
to
become
one
of
the
great
masters
of
fiction
she
had
evidently
a
special
predilection
for
works
of
that
kind
noticeable
because
hitherto
her
bent
might
have
appeared
almost
exclusively
towards
philosophy
to
the
novel
of
the
ordinary
stamp
she
is
merciless
in
her
sarcasm
one
of
her
most
pithy
articles
of
this
time
or
rather
later
its
date
being
is
directed
against
silly
novels
by
lady
novelists
these
she
says
consist
of
the
frothy
the
prosy
the
pious
or
the
pedantic
but
it
is
a
mixture
of
all
these
a
composite
order
of
feminine
fatuity
that
produces
the
largest
class
of
such
novels
which
we
shall
distinguish
as
the
and
species
we
had
imagined
that
destitute
women
turned
novelists
as
they
turned
governesses
because
they
had
no
other
means
of
getting
their
bread
empty
writing
was
excused
by
an
empty
stomach
and
twaddle
was
consecrated
by
tears
it
is
clear
that
they
write
in
elegant
boudoirs
with
ink
and
a
ruby
pen
that
they
must
be
entirely
indifferent
to
publishers
accounts
and
inexperienced
in
every
form
of
poverty
except
poverty
of
brains
after
finding
fault
with
what
she
sarcastically
calls
the
species
of
novel
a
sort
of
medical
sweetmeat
for
low
church
young
ladies
she
adds
the
real
drama
of
evangelicalism
and
it
has
abundance
of
fine
drama
for
any
one
who
has
genius
enough
to
discern
and
reproduce
it
lies
among
the
middle
and
lower
classes
why
can
we
not
have
pictures
of
religious
life
among
the
industrial
classes
in
england
as
interesting
as
stowe
pictures
of
religious
life
among
the
negroes
she
who
asked
that
question
was
herself
destined
a
few
years
later
to
answer
her
own
demand
in
most
triumphant
fashion
already
here
and
there
we
find
hints
and
suggestions
of
the
vein
that
was
to
be
so
fully
worked
out
in
of
clerical
life
and
bede
her
intimate
knowledge
of
english
country
life
and
the
hold
it
had
on
her
imagination
every
now
and
then
eats
its
way
to
the
surface
of
her
writings
and
stands
out
amongst
its
surrounding
matter
with
a
certain
unmistakable
native
force
after
censuring
the
lack
of
reality
with
which
peasant
life
is
commonly
treated
in
art
she
makes
the
following
apposite
remarks
suggested
by
her
own
experience
the
notion
that
peasants
are
joyous
that
the
typical
moment
to
represent
a
man
in
a
is
when
he
is
cracking
a
joke
and
showing
a
row
of
sound
teeth
that
cottage
matrons
are
usually
buxom
and
village
children
necessarily
rosy
and
merry
are
prejudices
difficult
to
dislodge
from
the
artistic
mind
which
looks
for
its
subjects
into
literature
instead
of
life
the
painter
is
still
under
the
influence
of
idyllic
literature
which
has
always
expressed
the
imagination
of
the
rather
than
the
truth
of
rustic
life
idyllic
ploughmen
are
jocund
when
they
drive
their
team
afield
idyllic
shepherds
make
bashful
love
under
hawthorn
bushes
idyllic
villagers
dance
in
the
chequered
shade
and
refresh
themselves
not
immoderately
with
spicy
ale
but
no
one
who
has
seen
much
of
actual
ploughmen
thinks
them
jocund
no
one
who
is
well
acquainted
with
the
english
peasantry
can
pronounce
them
merry
the
slow
gaze
in
which
no
sense
of
beauty
beams
no
humour
twinkles
the
slow
utterance
and
the
heavy
slouching
walk
remind
one
rather
of
that
melancholy
animal
the
camel
than
of
the
sturdy
countryman
with
striped
stockings
red
waistcoat
and
hat
aside
who
represents
the
traditional
english
peasant
observe
a
company
of
haymakers
when
you
see
them
at
a
distance
tossing
up
the
forkfuls
of
hay
in
the
golden
light
while
the
wagon
creeps
slowly
with
its
increasing
burden
over
the
meadow
and
the
bright
green
space
which
tells
of
work
done
gets
larger
and
larger
you
pronounce
the
scene
and
you
think
these
companions
in
labour
must
be
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
the
picture
to
which
they
give
animation
approach
nearer
and
you
will
find
haymaking
time
is
a
time
for
joking
especially
if
there
are
women
among
the
labourers
but
the
coarse
laugh
that
bursts
out
every
now
and
then
and
expresses
the
triumphant
taunt
is
as
far
as
possible
from
your
conception
of
idyllic
merriment
that
delicious
effervescence
of
the
mind
which
we
call
fun
has
no
equivalent
for
the
northern
peasant
except
tipsy
revelry
the
only
realm
of
fancy
and
imagination
for
the
english
clown
exists
at
the
bottom
of
the
third
quart
pot
the
conventional
countryman
of
the
stage
who
picks
up
and
never
looks
into
them
and
who
is
too
simple
even
to
know
that
honesty
has
its
opposite
represents
the
still
lingering
mistake
that
an
unintelligible
dialect
is
a
guarantee
for
ingenuousness
and
that
slouching
shoulders
indicate
an
upright
disposition
it
is
quite
sure
that
a
thresher
is
likely
to
be
innocent
of
any
adroit
arithmetical
cheating
but
he
is
not
the
less
likely
to
carry
home
his
master
corn
in
his
shoes
and
pocket
a
reaper
is
not
given
to
writing
but
he
is
quite
capable
of
cajoling
the
into
filling
his
bottle
with
ale
the
selfish
instincts
are
not
subdued
by
the
sight
of
buttercups
nor
is
integrity
in
the
least
established
by
that
classic
rural
occupation
to
make
men
moral
something
more
is
requisite
than
to
turn
them
out
to
grass
every
one
must
see
that
this
is
the
essay
writing
of
a
novelist
rather
than
of
a
moral
philosopher
the
touches
are
put
on
with
the
vigour
of
a
velasquez
balzac
or
flaubert
or
that
most
terrible
writer
of
the
modern
french
school
of
fiction
the
author
of
sabot
rouge
never
described
peasant
life
with
more
downright
veracity
in
the
eyes
of
miss
evans
this
quality
of
veracity
is
the
most
needful
of
all
for
the
artist
because
a
picture
of
human
life
such
as
a
great
artist
can
give
surprises
even
the
trivial
and
the
selfish
into
that
attention
to
what
is
apart
from
themselves
which
may
be
called
the
raw
material
of
sentiment
for
art
is
the
nearest
thing
to
life
it
is
a
mode
of
amplifying
experience
and
extending
our
contact
with
our
beyond
the
bounds
of
our
personal
lot
all
the
more
sacred
is
the
task
of
the
artist
when
he
undertakes
to
paint
the
life
of
the
people
falsification
here
is
far
more
pernicious
than
in
the
more
artificial
aspects
of
life
it
is
not
so
very
serious
that
we
should
have
false
ideas
about
evanescent
fashions
about
the
manners
and
conversation
of
beaux
and
duchesses
but
it
is
serious
that
our
sympathy
with
the
perennial
joys
and
struggles
the
toil
the
tragedy
and
the
humour
in
the
life
of
our
more
heavily
laden
should
be
perverted
and
turned
towards
a
false
object
instead
of
a
true
one
george
eliot
afterwards
faithfully
adhered
to
the
canons
fixed
by
the
critic
whether
this
consciousness
of
a
moral
purpose
was
altogether
a
gain
to
her
art
may
be
more
fitly
discussed
in
connection
with
the
analysis
of
her
works
of
fiction
it
is
only
needful
to
point
out
here
how
close
and
binding
she
wished
to
make
the
union
between
ethics
and
æsthetics
almost
identical
views
concerning
fundamental
laws
of
art
are
discussed
in
an
equally
terse
vigorous
and
pictorial
manner
in
an
article
called
in
art
recent
german
fiction
this
article
however
is
not
by
george
eliot
but
by
george
henry
lewis
it
was
published
in
october
and
appeared
after
their
joint
sojourn
in
germany
during
the
spring
and
summer
of
that
year
i
think
that
if
one
carefully
compares
in
art
with
george
eliot
other
articles
there
appears
something
like
a
marriage
of
their
respective
styles
in
this
paper
it
seems
probable
that
lewis
with
his
flexible
adaptiveness
had
come
under
the
influence
of
george
eliot
powerful
intellect
and
that
many
of
the
views
he
expresses
here
at
the
same
time
render
george
eliot
as
they
frequently
appear
identical
with
hers
in
the
article
in
question
the
manner
as
well
as
the
matter
has
a
certain
suggestion
of
the
novelist
style
for
example
she
frequently
indicates
the
quality
of
human
speech
by
its
resemblance
to
musical
sounds
she
is
fond
of
speaking
of
the
tones
of
a
voice
an
of
utter
indifference
and
in
the
essay
there
are
such
expressions
as
the
stately
of
good
german
prose
again
in
the
article
in
question
we
find
the
following
satirical
remarks
about
the
slovenly
prose
of
the
generality
of
german
writers
to
be
gentlemen
of
somewhat
slow
sluggish
minds
is
perhaps
their
misfortune
but
to
be
writers
deplorably
deficient
in
the
first
principles
of
composition
is
assuredly
their
fault
some
men
pasture
on
platitudes
as
oxen
upon
they
are
at
home
on
a
of
and
do
not
desire
to
be
irradiated
by
a
felicity
of
expression
and
in
another
passage
to
the
same
effect
the
author
says
sarcastically
graces
are
gifts
it
can
no
more
be
required
of
a
professor
that
he
should
write
with
felicity
than
that
he
should
charm
all
beholders
with
his
personal
appearance
but
literature
requires
that
he
should
write
intelligibly
and
carefully
as
society
requires
that
he
should
wash
his
face
and
button
his
waistcoat
some
of
these
strictures
are
very
similar
in
spirit
to
what
george
eliot
had
said
in
her
review
of
heinrich
heine
published
in
where
complaining
of
the
general
cumbrousness
of
german
writers
she
makes
the
following
cutting
remark
a
german
comedy
is
like
a
german
sentence
you
see
no
reason
in
its
structure
why
it
should
ever
come
to
an
end
and
you
accept
the
conclusion
as
an
arrangement
of
providence
rather
than
of
the
author
a
passage
in
this
article
which
exactly
tallies
with
george
general
remarks
on
art
must
not
be
omitted
here
art
is
a
representation
of
reality
a
representation
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
the
thing
itself
but
only
represents
it
must
necessarily
be
limited
by
the
nature
of
its
medium
realism
is
thus
the
basis
of
all
art
and
its
antithesis
is
not
idealism
but
falsism
to
misrepresent
the
forms
of
ordinary
life
is
no
less
an
offence
than
to
misrepresent
the
forms
of
ideal
life
a
apollo
or
jupiter
in
a
would
not
be
more
truly
shocking
to
an
artistic
mind
than
are
those
senseless
falsifications
of
nature
into
which
incompetence
is
led
under
the
pretence
of
nature
either
give
us
true
peasants
or
leave
them
untouched
either
paint
no
drapery
at
all
or
paint
it
with
the
utmost
fidelity
either
keep
your
people
silent
or
make
them
speak
the
idiom
of
their
class
among
german
novelists
or
rather
writers
of
short
stories
paul
heyse
is
one
of
the
few
who
is
singled
out
for
special
praise
in
this
review
and
it
is
curious
that
there
should
be
a
tale
by
this
eminent
author
called
lonely
ones
which
also
appeared
in
in
which
an
incident
occurs
forcibly
recalling
the
catastrophe
of
grandcourt
death
in
deronda
the
incident
although
unskilfully
introduced
of
a
neapolitan
fisherman
whose
momentary
murderous
hesitation
to
rescue
his
drowning
friend
ends
in
lifelong
remorse
for
his
death
what
makes
the
article
in
question
particularly
interesting
are
the
allusions
to
the
german
tour
which
give
it
an
almost
biographical
interest
as
has
been
mentioned
already
lewis
and
george
eliot
were
travelling
in
germany
in
the
spring
of
and
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
she
writes
then
we
had
a
delicious
journey
to
salzburg
and
from
thence
through
the
to
vienna
from
vienna
to
prague
and
from
prague
to
dresden
where
we
spent
our
last
six
weeks
in
quiet
work
and
quiet
worship
of
the
madonna
and
in
his
essay
on
art
lewis
alludes
to
the
most
priceless
dresden
contains
raphael
marvellous
picture
the
madonna
di
san
sisto
as
furnishing
the
most
perfect
illustration
of
what
he
means
by
realism
and
idealism
speaking
of
the
child
jesus
he
says
in
the
divine
babe
we
have
at
once
the
intensest
realism
of
presentation
with
the
highest
idealism
of
conception
the
attitude
is
at
once
grand
easy
and
natural
the
face
is
that
of
a
child
but
the
child
is
divine
in
those
eyes
and
in
that
brow
there
is
an
indefinable
something
which
greater
than
the
expression
of
the
angels
grander
than
that
of
pope
or
saint
is
to
all
who
see
it
a
perfect
we
feel
that
humanity
in
its
highest
conceivable
form
is
before
us
and
that
to
transcend
such
a
form
would
be
to
lose
sight
of
the
nature
there
represented
a
similar
passage
occurs
in
mill
on
the
floss
where
philip
wakem
says
the
greatest
of
painters
only
once
painted
a
mysteriously
divine
child
he
could
have
told
how
he
did
it
and
we
ca
tell
why
we
feel
it
to
be
divine
enough
has
probably
been
quoted
from
george
eliot
articles
to
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
her
views
on
art
but
they
are
so
rich
in
happy
aphorisms
originality
of
illustration
and
raciness
of
epithet
that
they
not
only
deserve
attentive
study
because
they
were
the
first
fruits
of
the
mind
that
afterwards
gave
to
the
world
such
noble
and
perfect
works
as
mill
on
the
floss
and
marner
but
are
well
worth
attention
for
their
own
sake
indeed
nothing
in
george
eliot
fictions
excels
the
style
of
these
papers
and
what
a
clear
incisive
masterly
style
it
was
her
prose
in
those
days
had
a
swiftness
of
movement
an
epigrammatic
felicity
and
a
brilliancy
of
antithesis
which
we
look
for
in
vain
in
the
sentences
and
somewhat
ponderous
wit
of
such
a
very
vapid
paper
on
and
its
celebrities
april
which
a
writer
in
the
attributes
to
the
same
hand
i
know
not
on
what
authority
does
not
possess
a
single
attribute
that
we
are
in
the
habit
of
associating
with
the
writings
of
george
eliot
that
an
author
who
by
that
time
had
already
produced
some
of
her
very
finest
work
namely
the
of
clerical
life
and
bede
should
have
been
responsible
simultaneously
for
the
trite
commonplaces
ventilated
in
this
article
is
simply
incredible
it
is
true
that
homer
is
sometimes
found
nodding
and
the
of
the
greatest
master
may
forget
its
cunning
but
would
george
eliot
in
her
most
abject
moments
have
been
capable
of
penning
such
a
sentence
as
this
in
connection
with
goethe
would
not
fredricka
or
lili
have
been
a
more
genial
companion
than
christina
vulpius
for
that
great
poet
of
whom
his
native
land
is
so
justly
proud
it
is
not
worth
while
to
point
out
other
platitudes
such
as
flow
spontaneously
from
the
facile
pen
of
a
but
the
consistent
misspelling
of
every
name
may
be
alluded
to
in
passing
thus
we
read
lily
for
lely
zetter
for
zelter
quintus
filein
for
fixlein
einsedel
for
einsiedel
etc
etc
this
in
itself
would
furnish
no
conclusive
argument
supposing
george
eliot
to
have
been
on
the
continent
and
out
of
the
way
of
correcting
proofs
but
as
it
happened
she
was
in
england
in
april
and
it
is
therefore
on
all
grounds
impossible
that
this
worthless
production
should
be
hers
perhaps
her
two
most
noteworthy
articles
are
the
one
called
teaching
published
in
and
the
other
on
and
other
worldliness
which
appeared
in
this
happy
phrase
by
the
way
was
first
used
by
coleridge
who
says
as
there
is
a
worldliness
or
the
too
much
of
this
life
so
there
is
another
or
rather
equally
hateful
and
selfish
with
these
articles
are
curious
because
they
seem
to
occupy
a
midway
position
between
george
eliot
earliest
and
latest
phase
of
religious
belief
but
at
this
period
she
still
felt
the
recoil
from
the
pressure
of
a
narrowing
dogmatism
too
freshly
not
to
launch
back
at
it
some
of
the
most
stinging
shafts
from
the
armoury
of
her
satire
not
heine
himself
in
his
trenchant
sallies
surpasses
the
irony
with
which
some
of
her
pages
are
bristling
to
ignore
this
stage
in
george
eliot
mental
development
would
be
to
lose
one
of
the
connecting
links
in
her
history
a
history
by
no
means
smooth
and
uneventful
as
some
times
superficially
represented
but
full
of
strong
contrasts
abrupt
transitions
outward
and
inward
changes
sympathetically
charged
with
all
the
meaning
of
this
transitional
time
two
extracts
from
the
articles
will
amply
testify
to
what
has
just
been
said
given
a
man
with
a
moderate
intellect
a
moral
standard
not
higher
than
the
average
some
rhetorical
affluence
and
great
glibness
of
speech
what
is
the
career
in
which
without
the
aid
of
birth
or
money
he
may
most
easily
attain
power
and
reputation
in
english
society
where
is
that
goshen
of
intellectual
mediocrity
in
which
a
smattering
of
science
and
learning
will
pass
for
profound
instruction
where
platitudes
will
be
accepted
as
wisdom
bigoted
narrowness
as
holy
zeal
unctuous
egoism
as
piety
let
such
a
man
become
an
evangelical
preacher
he
will
then
find
it
possible
to
reconcile
small
ability
with
great
ambition
superficial
knowledge
with
the
prestige
of
erudition
a
middling
morale
with
a
high
reputation
for
sanctity
let
him
shun
practical
extremes
and
be
ultra
only
in
what
is
purely
theoretic
let
him
be
stringent
on
predestination
but
latitudinarian
on
fasting
unflinching
in
insisting
on
the
eternity
of
punishment
but
diffident
of
curtailing
the
substantial
comforts
of
time
ardent
and
imaginative
on
the
advent
of
christ
but
cold
and
cautious
towards
every
other
infringement
of
the
let
him
fish
for
souls
not
with
the
bait
of
inconvenient
singularity
but
with
the
of
comfortable
conformity
let
him
be
hard
and
literal
in
his
interpretation
only
when
he
wants
to
hurl
texts
at
the
heads
of
unbelievers
and
adversaries
but
when
the
letter
of
the
scriptures
presses
too
closely
on
the
genteel
christianity
of
the
nineteenth
century
let
him
use
his
spiritualising
alembic
and
disperse
it
into
impalpable
ether
let
him
preach
less
of
christ
than
of
antichrist
let
him
be
less
definite
in
showing
what
sin
is
than
in
showing
who
is
the
man
of
sin
less
expansive
on
the
blessedness
of
faith
than
on
the
accursedness
of
infidelity
above
all
let
him
set
up
as
an
interpreter
of
prophecy
rival
almanack
in
the
prediction
of
political
events
tickling
the
interest
of
hearers
who
are
but
moderately
spiritual
by
showing
how
the
holy
spirit
has
dictated
problems
and
charades
for
their
benefit
and
how
if
they
are
ingenious
enough
to
solve
these
they
may
have
their
christian
graces
nourished
by
learning
precisely
to
whom
they
may
point
as
horn
that
had
eyes
lying
prophet
and
the
spirits
in
this
way
he
will
draw
men
to
him
by
the
strong
cords
of
their
passions
made
by
being
baptized
with
the
name
of
piety
in
this
way
he
may
gain
a
metropolitan
pulpit
the
avenues
to
his
church
will
be
as
crowded
as
the
passages
to
the
opera
he
has
but
to
print
his
prophetic
sermons
and
bind
them
in
lilac
and
gold
and
they
will
adorn
the
table
of
all
evangelical
ladies
who
will
regard
as
a
sort
of
pious
the
demonstration
that
the
prophecy
of
the
locusts
whose
sting
is
in
their
tail
is
fulfilled
in
the
fact
of
the
turkish
commander
having
taken
a
horse
tail
for
his
standard
and
that
the
french
are
the
very
frogs
predicted
in
the
revelations
even
more
scathing
than
this
onslaught
on
a
certain
type
of
the
popular
evangelical
preacher
is
the
paper
on
the
poet
young
one
of
the
wittiest
things
from
george
eliot
pen
wherein
she
castigates
with
all
her
powers
of
sarcasm
and
ridicule
that
class
of
believers
who
can
not
vilify
this
life
sufficiently
in
order
to
make
sure
of
the
next
and
who
in
the
care
of
their
own
souls
are
careless
of
the
world
need
her
analysis
of
the
thoughts
remains
one
of
the
most
brilliant
criticisms
of
its
kind
young
contempt
for
this
earth
of
all
of
us
and
his
exaltation
of
the
starry
worlds
above
especially
provoke
his
reviewer
wrath
this
frame
of
mind
was
always
repulsive
to
george
eliot
who
could
never
sufficiently
insist
on
the
need
of
concentrating
his
love
and
energy
on
the
life
around
him
she
never
felt
much
toleration
for
that
form
of
aspiration
that
would
soar
to
some
shadowy
infinite
beyond
the
circle
of
human
fellowship
one
of
the
most
epigrammatic
passages
in
this
article
is
where
she
says
of
young
no
man
can
be
better
fitted
for
an
established
church
he
personifies
completely
her
nice
balance
of
temporalities
and
spiritualities
he
is
equally
impressed
with
the
momentousness
of
death
and
of
burial
fees
he
languishes
at
once
for
immortal
life
and
for
he
has
a
fervid
attachment
to
patrons
in
general
but
on
the
whole
prefers
the
almighty
he
will
teach
with
something
more
than
official
conviction
the
nothingness
of
earthly
things
and
he
will
feel
something
more
than
private
disgust
if
his
meritorious
efforts
in
directing
men
attention
to
another
world
are
not
rewarded
by
substantial
preferment
in
this
his
secular
man
believes
in
cambric
bands
and
silk
stockings
as
characteristic
attire
for
ornament
of
religion
and
virtue
he
hopes
courtiers
will
never
forget
to
copy
sir
robert
walpole
and
writes
begging
letters
to
the
king
mistress
his
spiritual
man
recognizes
no
motives
more
familiar
than
golgotha
and
skies
it
walks
in
graveyards
or
soars
among
the
stars
if
it
were
not
for
the
prospect
of
immortality
he
considers
it
would
be
wise
and
agreeable
to
be
indecent
or
to
murder
one
father
and
heaven
apart
it
would
be
extremely
irrational
in
any
man
not
to
be
a
knave
man
he
thinks
is
a
compound
of
the
angel
and
the
brute
the
brute
is
to
be
humbled
by
being
reminded
of
its
to
the
stars
and
frightened
into
moderation
by
the
contemplation
of
deathbeds
and
skulls
the
angel
is
to
be
developed
by
vituperating
this
world
and
exalting
the
next
and
by
this
double
process
you
get
the
christian
highest
style
of
man
with
all
this
our
divine
is
an
unmistakable
poet
to
a
clay
compounded
chiefly
of
the
worldling
and
the
rhetorician
there
is
added
a
real
spark
of
promethean
fire
he
will
one
day
clothe
his
apostrophes
and
objurgations
his
astronomical
religion
and
his
charnel
house
morality
in
lasting
verse
which
will
stand
like
a
juggernaut
made
of
gold
and
jewels
at
once
magnificent
and
repulsive
for
this
divine
is
edward
young
the
future
author
of
the
thoughts
it
has
seemed
appropriate
to
quote
thus
largely
from
these
essays
because
never
having
been
reprinted
they
are
to
all
intents

purposes
inaccessible
to

they

much
that

martineau
at

delightfully
situated

acquaintance
with

had
ripened
into
a
cordial
friendship
they
met
constantly
both
in

in

and
their
intercourse
was
a
source
of
mutual

as
must
already
have
become
evident
it

erroneous
to
suppose
that
he

said

distinguished
by

breadth
of

have

george
eliot
touches
on
this
rumour
after
alluding
in
an
unmistakable
manner
to
another
great
contemporary
i
never
to
answer
one
of
your
questions
quite
directly
i
never
had
any
personal
acquaintance
with
naming
a
prominent
positivist
never
saw
him
to
my
knowledge
except
in
the
house
of
commons
and
though
i
have
studied
his
books
especially
his
and
economy
with
much
benefit
i
have
no
consciousness
of
their
having
made
any
marked
epoch
in
my
life
of
friendship
i
have
had
the
honour
and
advantage
for
twenty
years
but
i
believe
that
every
main
bias
of
my
mind
had
been
taken
before
i
knew
him
like
the
rest
of
his
readers
i
am
of
course
indebted
to
him
for
much
enlargement
and
clarifying
of
thought
but
there
was
another
acquaintance
which
miss
evans
made
during
the
first
year
of
her
residence
in
the
strand
destined
to
affect
the
whole
future
tenor
of
her
life
the
acquaintance
of
george
henry
lewes
then
like
her
a
contributor
to
the
george
henry
lewes
was
marian
senior
by
two
years
having
been
born
in
london
on
the
of
april
he
was
educated
at
greenwich
in
a
school
once
possessing
a
high
reputation
for
thoroughly
grounding
its
pupils
in
a
knowledge
of
the
classics
when
his
education
was
so
far
finished
he
was
placed
as
clerk
in
a
merchant
office
this
kind
of
occupation
proving
very
distasteful
he
turned
medical
student
for
a
time
very
early
in
life
he
was
attracted
towards
philosophy
for
at
the
age
of
nineteen
we
find
him
attending
the
weekly
meetings
of
a
small
club
in
the
habit
of
discussing
metaphysical
problems
in
the
parlour
of
a
tavern
in
red
lion
square
holborn
this
club
from
which
the
one
in
deronda
is
supposed
to
have
borrowed
many
of
its
features
was
the
point
of
junction
for
a
most
heterogeneous
company
here
amicably
seated
round
the
fire
a
speculative
tailor
would
hob
and
nob
with
some
medical
student
deep
in
anatomy
a
bookseller
having
devoured
the
literature
on
his
shelves
ventilated
their
contents
for
the
general
benefit
and
a
discursive
american
mystic
was
listened
to
in
turn
with
a
jewish
journeyman
watchmaker
deeply
imbued
with
spinozism
it
is
impossible
not
to
connect
this
jew
named
cohen
and
described
as
a
man
of
astonishing
subtilty
and
logical
force
no
less
than
of
sweet
personal
worth
with
the
mordecai
of
the
novel
just
mentioned
however
wide
the
after
divergencies
here
evidently
lies
the
germ
the
weak
eyes
and
chest
the
grave
and
gentle
demeanour
the
whole
ideality
of
character
correspond
in
some
respects
lewes
was
the
daniel
deronda
to
this
mordecai
for
he
not
only
loved
but
venerated
his
great
calm
intellect
an
immense
pity
says
lewes
a
fervid
indignation
filled
me
as
i
came
away
from
his
attics
in
one
of
the
holborn
courts
where
i
had
seen
him
in
the
pinching
poverty
of
his
home
with
his
german
wife
and
two
little
children
to
this
suffering
watchmaker
lewes
owed
his
first
acquaintance
with
spinoza
a
certain
passage
casually
cited
by
cohen
awakened
an
eager
thirst
for
more
in
the
youth
the
desire
to
possess
himself
of
spinoza
works
still
in
the
odour
of
pestilential
heresy
haunted
him
like
a
passion
for
he
himself
then
suffering
the
social
persecution
which
embitters
any
departure
from
accepted
creeds
felt
in
defiant
sympathy
with
all
outcasts
on
a
dreary
november
evening
the
coveted
volumes
were
at
length
discovered
on
the
dingy
shelves
of
a
bookseller
by
the
flaring
gaslight
young
lewes
with
a
beating
heart
read
on
the
back
of
a
small
brown
quarto
those
thrilling
words
opera
posthuma
he
was
poor
in
those
days
and
the
price
of
the
volume
was
twenty
shillings
but
he
would
gladly
have
sacrificed
his
last
sixpence
to
secure
it
having
paid
his
money
with
feverish
delight
he
hurried
home
in
triumph
and
immediately
set
to
work
on
a
translation
of
the
which
however
he
was
too
impatient
to
finish
this
little
incident
is
well
worth
dwelling
upon
not
only
as
being
the
first
introduction
of
a
notable
thinker
to
philosophy
but
as
showing
the
eager
impulsive
nature
of
the
man
the
study
of
spinoza
led
to
his
publishing
an
article
on
his
life
and
works
in
the
of
almost
the
first
account
of
the
great
hebrew
philosopher
which
appeared
in
this
country
this
article
afterwards
incorporated
in
the
history
of
philosophy
formed
the
nucleus
i
believe
of
that
admirable
piece
of
synthetic
criticism
and
exposition
as
frederic
harrison
calls
it
a
work
which
according
to
him
has
influenced
the
thought
of
the
present
generation
almost
more
than
any
single
book
except
mill
before
the
appearance
of
either
article
or
of
philosophy
lewes
went
to
germany
and
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
its
language
and
literature
just
brought
into
fashion
by
carlyle
returning
to
england
in
he
became
one
of
the
most
prolific
journalists
of
the
day
witty
brilliant
and
he
seemed
fitted
by
nature
for
a
press
writer
and
his
versatility
was
so
amazing
that
a
clever
talker
once
said
of
him
lewes
can
do
everything
in
the
world
but
paint
and
he
could
do
that
too
after
a
study
at
this
time
besides
assisting
in
the
editorship
of
the
he
wrote
for
the
the
the
and
the
after
publishing
biographical
history
of
philosophy
through
knight
volumes
in
he
wrote
two
novels
and
blanche
and
violet
which
successively
appeared
in
and
but
fiction
was
not
his
these
two
productions
being
singularly
crude
and
immature
as
compared
with
his
excellent
philosophical
work
some
jokes
in
the
papers
about
rant
killed
what
little
life
there
was
in
ranthorpe
nevertheless
charlotte
brontë
who
had
some
correspondence
with
lewes
about
actually
wrote
about
it
as
follows
in
reading
i
have
read
a
new
book
not
a
reprint
not
a
reflection
of
any
other
book
but
a
another
great
writer
edgar
poe
admired
it
no
less
for
he
says
of
the
work
i
have
lately
read
it
with
deep
interest
and
derived
great
from
it
also
it
relates
to
the
career
of
a
literary
man
and
gives
a
just
view
of
the
true
aims
and
the
true
dignity
of
the
literary
character
spanish
drama
life
of
maximilian
robespierre
with
extracts
from
his
unpublished
correspondence
noble
heart
a
tragedy
all
followed
in
close
succession
from
the
same
inexhaustible
pen
the
last
it
was
said
proved
also
a
tragedy
to
the
publishers
but
not
content
with
writing
dramas
lewes
was
also
ambitious
of
the
fame
of
an
actor
the
theatre
having
always
possessed
a
strong
fascination
for
him
already
as
a
child
he
had
haunted
the
theatres
and
now
while
delivering
a
lecture
at
the
philosophical
institution
in
edinburgh
he
shocked
its
staid
not
a
little
by
immediately
afterwards
appearing
on
the
stage
in
the
character
of
shylock
so
many
and
seemingly
incompatible
were
lewes
pursuits
but
this
extreme
mobility
of
mind
this
intellectual
tripping
from
subject
to
subject
retarded
the
growth
of
his
popularity
the
present
mechanical
subdivision
of
labour
has
most
unfortunately
also
affected
the
judgment
passed
on
literary
and
artistic
products
let
a
man
once
have
written
a
novel
typical
of
the
manners
and
ways
of
a
certain
class
of
english
society
or
painted
a
picture
with
certain
peculiar
effects
of
sea
or
landscape
or
composed
a
poem
affecting
the
very
trick
and
language
of
some
bygone
mediæval
singer
he
will
be
doomed
to
the
end
of
his
days
to
do
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
nothing
can
well
be
more
deadening
to
any
vigorous
mental
life
and
lewes
set
a
fine
example
of
intellectual
disinterestedness
in
sacrificing
immediate
success
to
the
free
play
of
a
most
variously
endowed
nature
the
public
too
was
a
gainer
by
this
for
the
life
of
goethe
could
not
have
been
made
the
rich
comprehensive
biography
it
is
had
lewes
himself
not
tried
his
hand
at
such
a
variety
of
subjects
this
life
begun
in
the
result
partly
of
his
sojourn
in
germany
did
not
appear
in
print
until
ultimately
destined
to
a
great
and
lasting
success
the
of
the
of
goethe
was
ignominiously
sent
from
one
publisher
to
another
until
at
last
david
nutt
of
the
strand
showed
his
acumen
by
giving
it
to
the
reading
world
some
years
before
the
publication
of
this
biography
lewes
had
also
been
one
of
the
founders
of
that
able
but
unsuccessful
weekly
the
of
which
he
was
the
literary
editor
from
to
many
of
his
articles
on
auguste
comte
were
originally
written
for
this
paper
and
afterwards
collected
into
a
volume
for
bohn
series
indeed
after
john
stuart
mill
he
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
earliest
exponent
of
positivism
in
england
he
not
only
considered
the
de
philosophie
the
greatest
work
of
this
century
but
believed
it
would
form
one
of
the
mighty
landmarks
in
the
history
of
opinion
no
one
before
comte
he
says
ever
dreamed
of
treating
social
problems
otherwise
than
upon
theological
or
metaphysical
methods
he
first
showed
how
possible
nay
how
imperative
it
was
that
social
questions
should
be
treated
on
the
same
footing
with
all
other
scientific
questions
this
being
his
object
he
was
forced
to
detect
the
law
of
mental
evolution
before
he
could
advance
this
law
is
the
law
of
historical
progression
but
while
lewes
with
his
talent
for
succinct
exposition
helped
more
than
any
other
englishman
to
disseminate
the
principles
of
philosophy
in
this
country
he
was
at
the
same
time
violently
opposed
to
his
with
its
schemes
of
social
reorganisation
even
so
slight
a
survey
as
this
must
show
the
astonishing
discursiveness
of
lewes
intellect
by
the
time
he
was
thirty
he
had
already
tried
his
hand
at
criticism
fiction
biography
the
drama
and
philosophy
he
had
enlarged
his
experience
of
human
nature
by
foreign
travel
he
had
addressed
audiences
from
the
lecturer
platform
he
had
enjoyed
the
perilous
sweets
of
editing
a
newspaper
he
had
even
it
is
said
played
the
harlequin
in
a
company
of
strolling
actors
indeed
thackeray
was
once
heard
to
say
that
it
would
not
surprise
him
to
meet
lewes
in
piccadilly
riding
on
a
white
elephant
whilst
another
wit
likened
him
to
the
wandering
jew
as
you
could
never
tell
where
he
was
going
to
turn
up
or
what
he
was
going
to
do
next
in
this
discursiveness
of
intellect
he
more
nearly
resembled
the
encyclopedists
of
the
century
than
the
men
of
his
own
time
indeed
his
personal
appearance
temperament
manners
general
tone
of
thought
seemed
rather
to
be
those
of
a
foreigner
than
of
an
englishman
he
was
a
fragile
man
with
bushy
curly
hair
and
a
general
shagginess
of
beard
and
eyebrow
not
unsuggestive
of
a
skye
terrier
for
the
rest
he
had
a
prominent
mouth
and
grey
eyes
under
an
ample
forehead
volatile
by
nature
somewhat
wild
and
lawless
in
his
talk
he
in
turn
delighted
and
shocked
his
friends
by
the
gaiety
recklessness
and
genial
of
his
manners
and
conversation
his
companionship
was
singularly
stimulating
for
the
commonest
topic
served
him
as
a
for
the
lucid
development
of
some
pet
philosophical
theory
in
this
gift
of
making
abstruse
problems
intelligible
and
difficult
things
easy
he
had
some
resemblance
to
the
late
clifford
with
his
magical
faculty
of
illuminating
the
most
abstruse
subjects
by
his
vivid
directness
of
exposition
as
lewes
life
was
so
soon
to
be
closely
united
to
that
of
marian
evans
this
cursory
sketch
of
his
career
will
not
seem
inappropriate
at
the
time
they
met
at
chapman
house
lewes
who
had
married
early
in
life
found
his
conjugal
relations
irretrievably
spoiled
how
far
the
blame
of
this
might
attach
to
one
side
or
to
the
other
does
not
concern
us
here
enough
that
in
the
intercourse
with
a
woman
of
such
astonishing
intellect
varied
acquirements
and
rare
sympathy
lewes
discovered
a
community
of
ideas
and
a
moral
support
that
had
been
sadly
lacking
to
his
existence
hitherto
in
many
ways
these
two
natures
so
opposite
in
character
disposition
and
tone
of
mind
who
from
such
different
had
reached
the
same
standpoint
seemed
to
need
each
other
for
the
final
fruition
and
utmost
development
of
what
was
best
in
each
a
crisis
was
now
impending
in
marian
life
she
was
called
upon
to
make
her
private
judgment
a
law
unto
herself
and
to
shape
her
actions
not
according
to
the
recognised
moral
standard
of
her
country
but
in
harmony
with
her
own
convictions
of
right
and
wrong
from
a
girl
it
appears
she
had
held
independent
views
about
marriage
strongly
advocating
the
german
divorce
laws
on
the
appearance
of
eyre
when
every
one
was
talking
of
this
book
and
praising
the
exemplary
conduct
of
jane
in
her
famous
interview
with
rochester
marian
evans
then
only
remarked
to
a
friend
that
in
his
position
she
considered
him
justified
in
contracting
a
fresh
marriage
and
in
an
article
on
madame
de
sablé
written
as
early
as
there
is
this
significant
passage
in
reference
to
the
laxity
of
opinion
and
practice
with
regard
to
the
in
france
heaven
forbid
she
writes
that
we
should
enter
on
a
defence
of
french
morals
most
of
all
in
relation
to
marriage
but
it
is
undeniable
that
unions
formed
in
the
maturity
of
thought
and
feeling
and
grounded
only
on
inherent
fitness
and
mutual
attraction
tended
to
bring
women
into
more
intelligent
sympathy
with
man
and
to
heighten
and
complicate
their
share
in
the
political
drama
the
quiescence
and
security
of
the
conjugal
relation
are
doubtless
favourable
to
the
manifestation
of
the
highest
qualities
by
persons
who
have
already
attained
a
high
standard
of
culture
but
rarely
foster
a
passion
sufficient
to
rouse
all
the
faculties
to
aid
in
winning
or
retaining
its
beloved
object
to
convert
indolence
into
activity
indifference
into
ardent
partisanship
dulness
into
perspicuity
such
a
union
formed
in
the
full
maturity
of
thought
and
feeling
was
now
contracted
by
marian
evans
and
george
henry
lewes
legal
union
however
there
could
be
none
for
though
virtually
separated
from
his
wife
lewes
could
not
get
a
divorce
too
little
has
as
yet
transpired
concerning
this
important
step
to
indicate
more
than
the
bare
outline
of
events
enough
that
lewes
appears
to
have
written
a
letter
in
which
after
a
full
explanation
of
his
circumstances
he
used
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
to
win
miss
evans
for
his
companion
that
she
consented
after
having
satisfied
her
conscience
that
in
reality
she
was
not
injuring
the
claims
of
others
and
that
henceforth
she
bore
lewes
name
and
became
his
wife
in
every
sense
but
the
legal
one
this
proceeding
caused
the
utmost
consternation
amongst
her
acquaintances
especially
amongst
her
friends
at
rosehill
the
former
intimate
and
affectionate
intercourse
with
bray
and
her
sister
was
only
gradually
restored
and
only
after
they
had
come
to
realise
how
perfectly
her
own
conscience
had
been
consulted
and
satisfied
in
the
matter
miss
hennell
who
had
already
entered
on
the
scheme
of
religious
doctrine
which
ever
since
she
has
been
setting
forth
in
her
printed
works
swerved
nothing
from
her
own
principles
that
the
maintenance
of
a
conventional
form
of
marriage
remoulded
to
the
demands
of
the
present
age
is
essentially
attached
to
all
religion
and
so
to
the
religion
of
the
future
in
thus
defying
public
opinion
and
forming
a
connection
in
opposition
to
the
laws
of
society
george
eliot
must
have
undergone
some
trials
and
sufferings
peculiarly
painful
to
one
so
shrinkingly
sensitive
as
herself
conscious
of
no
enjoying
the
rare
happiness
of
completest
intellectual
fellowship
in
the
man
she
loved
the
step
she
had
taken
made
a
gap
between
her
kindred
and
herself
which
could
not
but
gall
her
clinging
womanly
nature
to
some
of
her
early
companions
indeed
who
had
always
felt
a
certain
awe
at
the
imposing
gravity
of
her
manners
this
dereliction
from
what
appeared
to
them
the
path
of
duty
was
almost
as
startling
and
unexpected
as
if
they
had
seen
the
heavens
falling
down
how
far
the
individual
can
ever
be
justified
in
following
the
dictates
of
his
private
judgment
in
opposition
to
the
laws
and
prevalent
opinions
of
his
time
and
country
must
remain
a
question
no
less
difficult
than
delicate
of
decision
it
is
precisely
the
point
where
the
highest
natures
and
the
lowest
sometimes
apparently
meet
since
to
act
in
opposition
to
custom
may
be
due
to
the
loftiest
motives
may
be
the
spiritual
exaltation
of
the
reformer
braving
social
ostracism
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
or
may
spring
on
the
other
hand
from
purely
rebellious
promptings
of
an
egoism
which
recognises
no
law
higher
than
that
of
personal
gratification
at
the
same
time
it
seems
that
no
progress
could
well
be
made
in
the
evolution
of
society
without
these
departures
on
the
part
of
individuals
from
the
tracks
for
even
the
failures
help
eventually
towards
a
fuller
recognition
of
what
is
beneficial
and
possible
of
attainment
mary
wollstonecraft
shelley
george
sand
the
new
england
transcendentalists
with
their
communistic
experiment
at
brooke
farm
all
more
or
less
strove
to
be
to
a
better
and
happier
state
of
society
george
eliot
however
hardly
belonged
to
this
order
of
mind
circumstances
prompted
her
to
disregard
one
of
the
most
binding
laws
of
society
yet
while
she
considered
herself
justified
in
doing
so
her
sympathies
were
on
the
whole
more
enlisted
in
the
state
of
things
as
they
are
than
as
they
might
be
it
is
certainly
curious
that
the
woman
who
in
her
own
life
had
followed
such
an
independent
course
severing
herself
in
many
ways
from
her
past
with
all
its
traditional
sanctities
should
yet
so
often
inculcate
the
very
opposite
teaching
in
her
works
should
inculcate
an
almost
slavish
adherence
to
whatever
surroundings
beliefs
and
family
ties
a
human
being
may
be
born
to
i
need
only
add
here
that
lewes
and
marian
went
to
germany
soon
after
forming
this
union
which
only
ending
by
death
gave
to
each
what
had
hitherto
been
lacking
in
their
lives
many
marriages
solemnised
in
a
church
and
ushered
in
with
all
the
ostentation
of
bridesmaids
and
wedding
breakfast
are
indeed
less
essentially
such
in
all
the
deeper
human
aspects
which
this
relation
implies
than
the
one
contracted
in
this
informal
manner
indeed
to
those
who
saw
them
together
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
never
be
apart
yet
while
so
entirely
at
one
each
respected
the
other
individuality
his
own
at
the
same
time
gaining
in
strength
by
the
contact
lewes
mercurial
disposition
now
assumed
a
stability
greatly
enhancing
his
brilliant
talents
and
for
the
first
time
facilitating
that
concentration
of
intellect
so
necessary
for
the
production
of
really
lasting
philosophic
work
on
the
other
hand
george
eliot
still
dormant
faculties
were
roused
and
stimulated
to
the
utmost
by
the
man
to
whom
this
union
with
her
formed
the
most
memorable
year
of
his
life
by
his
enthusiastic
belief
in
her
he
gave
her
the
only
thing
she
wanted
a
thorough
belief
in
herself
indeed
he
was
more
than
a
husband
he
was
as
an
intimate
friend
once
pithily
remarked
a
very
mother
to
her
tenderly
watching
over
her
delicate
health
cheering
the
grave
tenor
of
her
thoughts
by
his
inexhaustible
buoyancy
jealously
shielding
her
from
every
adverse
breath
of
criticism
lewes
in
a
manner
created
the
spiritual
atmosphere
in
which
george
eliot
could
best
put
forth
all
the
flowers
and
fruits
of
her
genius
in
joining
her
life
with
that
of
lewes
the
care
of
his
three
children
devolved
upon
george
eliot
who
henceforth
showed
them
the
undeviating
love
and
tenderness
of
a
mother
one
of
the
sons
had
gone
out
to
natal
as
a
young
man
and
contracted
a
fatal
disease
which
complicated
with
some
accident
resulted
in
an
untimely
death
he
returned
home
a
hopeless
invalid
and
his
tedious
illness
was
cheered
by
the
affectionate
tendance
of
her
who
had
for
so
many
years
acted

chapter
vii
scenes
of
clerical
life
as
has
already
been
mentioned
lewes
and
marian
went
to
germany
in
dividing
the
year
between
berlin
munich
and
weimar
in
the
latter
pleasant
little
saxon
city
on
which
the
mighty
influence
of
goethe
seemed
still
visibly
resting
as
the
reflection
of
the
sun
lingers
in
the
sky
long
after
the
sun
himself
has
set
lewes
partly
his
of
goethe
here
must
have
been
spent
many
delightful
days
wandering
in
goethe
track
exploring
the
beautiful
neighbourhood
and
enjoying
some
of
the
most
cultivated
society
in
germany
several
articles
on
german
life
and
literature
afterwards
published
in
the
were
probably
written
at
this
time
the
translation
of
spinoza
by
george
eliot
was
also
executed
in
the
same
year
lewes
alluding
to
it
in
life
says
in
a
it
may
interest
some
readers
to
learn
that
spinoza
will
ere
long
appear
in
english
edited
by
the
writer
of
these
lines
this
was
a
delusive
promise
since
the
translation
has
not
yet
made
its
appearance
but
surely
its
publication
would
now
be
warmly
welcomed
the
time
however
was
approaching
when
george
eliot
was
at
last
to
discover
where
her
real
mastery
lay
and
this
is
the
way
as
the
story
goes
that
she
discovered
it
they
had
returned
from
the
continent
and
were
settled
again
in
london
both
actively
engaged
in
literature
but
literature
unless
in
certain
cases
of
triumphant
popularity
is
perhaps
the
worst
paid
of
all
work
lewes
and
george
eliot
were
not
too
well
off
the
former
infinite
in
resources
having
himself
tried
every
form
of
literature
in
turn
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
matchless
power
of
observation
and
the
memory
matching
it
in
power
of
the
future
novelist
one
day
an
idea
struck
him
my
dear
he
said
i
think
you
could
write
a
capital
story
shortly
afterwards
there
was
some
dinner
engagement
but
as
he
was
preparing
to
go
out
she
said
i
wo
go
out
this
evening
and
when
you
come
in
do
disturb
me
i
shall
be
very
busy
and
this
was
how
the
of
clerical
life
came
first
to
be
written
on
being
shown
a
portion
of
the
first
tale
barton
lewes
was
fairly
amazed
stories
are
usually
fabricated
after
the
event
but
if
not
true
they
often
truly
paint
a
situation
and
the
general
testimony
of
friends
seems
to
agree
that
it
was
lewes
who
first
incited
the
gifted
woman
of
whose
great
powers
he
was
best
able
to
form
a
judgment
to
express
herself
in
that
species
of
literature
which
would
afford
the
fullest
scope
to
the
creative
and
dramatic
faculties
which
she
so
eminently
possessed
here
however
his
influence
ended
he
helped
to
reveal
george
eliot
to
herself
and
after
that
there
was
little
left
for
him
to
do
but
this
gift
of
stimulating
another
by
sympathetic
insight
and
critical
appreciation
is
itself
of
priceless
value
when
schiller
died
goethe
said
the
half
of
my
existence
is
gone
from
me
a
terrible
word
to
utter
for
one
so
great
but
never
again
he
knew
would
he
meet
with
the
same
complete
comprehension
and
lacking
that
his
genius
itself
seemed
less
his
own
than
before
there
is
an
impression
abroad
that
lewes
if
anything
did
some
injury
to
george
eliot
from
a
literary
point
of
view
that
the
nature
of
his
pursuits
led
her
to
adopt
too
technical
and
pedantic
a
phraseology
in
her
novels
but
this
idea
is
unjust
to
both
in
comparing
her
earliest
with
her
latest
style
it
is
clear
that
from
the
first
she
was
apt
to
cull
her
illustrations
from
the
physical
sciences
thereby
showing
how
much
these
studies
had
become
part
of
herself
indeed
she
was
far
more
liable
to
introduce
these
scientific
modes
of
expression
than
lewes
as
may
be
easily
seen
by
comparing
his
of
goethe
partly
in
with
some
of
her
essays
of
the
same
date
as
to
her
matter
it
is
curious
how
much
of
it
was
drawn
from
the
earliest
sources
of
memory
from
that
life
of
her
childhood
to
which
she
may
sometimes
have
turned
yearningly
as
to
a
paradise
most
of
her
works
might
indeed
not
inaptly
be
called
backward
they
are
a
but
entirely
tender
revivification
of
the
days
that
are
no
more
no
one
however
intimate
could
really
intermeddle
with
the
workings
of
a
genius
drawing
its
happiest
inspiration
from
the
earliest
experiences
of
its
own
individual
past
nothing
is
more
characteristic
of
this
obvious
tendency
than
the
first
of
the
of
clerical
life
sad
fortunes
of
the
rev
amos
barton
at
chilvers
coton
the
curious
in
such
matters
may
still
see
the
identical
church
where
the
incumbent
of
shepperton
used
to
preach
sermons
shrewdly
compounded
of
high
church
doctrines
and
low
church
evangelicalism
not
forgetting
to
note
its
little
flight
of
steps
with
their
wooden
rail
running
up
the
outer
wall
and
leading
to
the
gallery
there
they
may
still
see
the
little
churchyard
though
they
may
look
in
vain
for
the
slim
black
figure
of
the
rev
amos
as
it
flits
past
the
pale
gravestones
in
the
silver
light
that
falls
aslant
on
church
and
tomb
and
among
the
tombs
there
is
one
a
handsome
substantial
monument
overshadowed
by
a
on
which
there
is
this
inscription
here
lies
waiting
the
summons
of
the
archangel
trumpet
all
that
was
mortal
of
the
beloved
wife
of
the
rev
john
gwyther
curate
of
this
parish
aged
years
leaving
a
husband
and
seven
children
this
emma
gwyther
is
none
other
than
the
beautiful
milly
the
wife
of
amos
so
touchingly
described
by
george
eliot
whose
mother
evans
was
her
intimate
friend
george
eliot
would
be
in
her
teens
when
she
heard
the
story
of
this
sweet
woman
heard
the
circumstantial
details
of
her
struggles
to
make
the
two
ends
of
a
ridiculously
small
income
meet
the
yearly
expenses
heard
her
mother
no
doubt
in
the
words
of
hackit
blame
her
weak
forbearance
in
tolerating
the
presence
in
her
house
of
the
luxurious
and
exacting
countess
who
having
ingratiated
herself
with
the
gullible
amos
by
her
talk
of
the
livings
she
would
get
him
gave
much
scandal
in
the
neighbourhood
heard
of
the
pathetic
when
worn
by
care
and
toil
the
gentle
life
ebbed
quietly
away
leaving
a
void
in
her
husband
heart
and
home
all
this
was
the
talk
of
the
neighbourhood
when
george
eliot
was
a
girl
and
her
extraordinary
memory
allowed
nothing
to
escape
on
the
completion
of
barton
lewes
who
as
already
mentioned
was
a
contributor
to
sent
the
to
the
editor
the
late
john
blackwood
as
the
work
of
an
anonymous
friend
this
was
in
the
autumn
of
the
other
scenes
of
life
were
then
unwritten
but
the
editor
was
informed
that
the
story
submitted
to
his
approval
formed
one
of
a
series
though
his
judgment
was
favourable
he
begged
to
see
some
of
the
other
tales
before
accepting
this
freely
making
some
criticisms
on
the
plot
and
studies
of
character
in
barton
this
however
disheartened
the
author
whose
peculiar
diffidence
had
only
been
overcome
by
lewes
hearty
commendation
when
the
editor
had
been
made
aware
of
the
injurious
effect
of
his
objections
he
hastened
to
efface
it
by
accepting
the
tale
without
further
delay
it
appeared
soon
afterwards
in
for
january
where
it
occupied
the
first
place
this
story
by
some
considered
as
fine
as
anything
the
novelist
ever
wrote
came
to
an
end
in
the
next
number
gilfil
love
story
and
were
written
in
quick
succession
and
the
series
was
completed
in
november
of
the
same
year
although
there
was
nothing
sufficiently
sensational
in
these
to
arrest
the
attention
of
that
great
public
which
must
be
roused
by
something
new
and
startling
literary
judges
were
not
slow
to
discern
the
powerful
realism
with
which
the
author
had
drawn
these
uncompromising
studies
from
life
after
the
appearance
of
barton
blackwood
wrote
to
the
anonymous
author
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
read
anything
so
fresh
so
humorous
and
so
touching
the
style
is
capital
conveying
so
much
in
so
few
words
soon
afterwards
he
began
another
letter
my
dear
amos
i
forget
whether
i
told
you
or
lewes
that
i
had
shown
part
of
the
to
thackeray
he
was
staying
with
me
and
having
been
out
at
dinner
came
in
about
eleven
when
i
had
just
finished
reading
it
i
said
to
him
you
know
that
i
think
i
have
lighted
upon
a
new
author
who
is
uncommonly
like
a
passenger
i
showed
him
a
page
or
two
i
think
the
passage
where
the
curate
returns
home
and
milly
is
first
introduced
he
would
not
pronounce
whether
it
came
up
to
my
ideas
but
remarked
afterwards
that
he
would
have
liked
to
have
read
more
which
i
thought
a
good
sign
dickens
after
the
publication
of
the
sent
a
letter
to
the
unknown
writer
through
the
editor
warmly
expressing
the
admiration
he
felt
for
them
but
he
was
strongly
of
opinion
from
the
first
that
they
must
have
been
written
by
a
woman
in
the
meanwhile
the
tales
were
reprinted
in
a
collected
form
and
they
were
so
successful
that
the
editor
writing
to
lewes
at
the
end
of
january
when
the
book
had
hardly
been
out
a
month
was
able
to
say
george
eliot
has
fairly
achieved
a
literary
reputation
among
judges
and
the
public
must
follow
although
it
may
take
time
and
in
a
letter
to
george
eliot
herself
he
wrote
in
february
you
will
recollect
when
we
proposed
to
reprint
my
impression
was
that
the
series
had
not
lasted
long
enough
in
the
magazine
to
give
you
a
hold
on
the
general
public
although
long
enough
to
make
your
literary
reputation
unless
in
exceptional
cases
a
very
long
time
often
elapses
between
the
two
stages
of
reputation
the
literary
and
the
public
your
progress
will
be
if
not
so
quick
as
we
could
wish
while
the
sketches
were
being
in
book
form
blackwood
informed
its
author
that
they
saw
good
cause
for
making
a
large
increase
in
the
forthcoming
reprint
and
their
anticipations
were
fully
justified
by
its
success
all
sorts
of
rumours
were
abroad
as
to
the
real
author
of
these
clerical
tales
misled
by
a
hint
calculated
to
throw
him
off
the
real
scent
blackwood
was
at
first
under
the
impression
that
they
were
the
work
of
a
clergyman
and
perhaps
this
may
have
been
the
origin
of
a
belief
which
lingered
till
quite
recently
that
george
eliot
was
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
a
statement
made
by
several
of
the
leading
daily
papers
after
her
death
abandoning
the
idea
of
the
clergyman
blackwood
next
fixed
upon
a
very
different
sort
of
person
to
wit
professor
owen
whom
he
suspected
owing
to
the
similarity
of
handwriting
and
the
scientific
knowledge
so
exceptional
in
a
novelist
no
less
funny
was
the
supposition
held
by
others
of
lord
lytton
who
more
than
once
hoaxed
the
public
under
a
new
literary
disguise
having
at
last
surpassed
himself
in
the
sterling
excellence
of
these
tales
now
that
bulwer
has
gone
the
way
of
all
fashions
it
seems
incredible
that
the
most
obtuse
and
of
critics
should
have
mistaken
for
a
moment
his
sentimental
style
for
the
new
author
terse
vigorous
and
simple
prose
it
was
impossible
however
for
an
author
to
remain
a
mere
nameless
abstraction
an
appellation
of
some
kind
became
an
imperative
necessity
and
during
the
passage
of
gilfil
love
story
through
the
press
the
pseudonym
of
george
eliot
a
name
destined
to
become
so
justly
renowned
was
finally
assumed
the
of
clerical
life
were
to
george
eliot
future
works
what
a
bold
spirited
sketch
is
to
a
carefully
elaborated
picture
all
the
qualities
that
distinguished
her
genius
may
be
discovered
in
this
her
first
essay
in
fiction
with
all
miss
austen
matchless
faculty
for
painting
commonplace
characters
george
eliot
has
that
other
nobler
faculty
of
showing
what
tragedy
pathos
and
humour
may
be
lying
in
the
experience
of
a
human
soul
that
looks
out
through
dull
grey
eyes
and
that
speaks
in
a
voice
of
quite
ordinary
tones
while
depicting
some
commonplace
detail
of
every
day
life
she
has
the
power
to
make
her
reader
realise
its
close
relation
to
the
universal
life
she
never
gives
you
the
mere
dry
bones
and
fragments
of
existence
as
represented
in
some
particular
section
of
society
but
always
manages
to
keep
before
the
mind
the
invisible
links
connecting
it
with
the
world
at
large
in
gilfil
love
story
there
is
a
passage
as
beautiful
as
any
in
her
works
and
fully
illustrating
this
attitude
of
her
mind
it
is
where
tina
finding
herself
deceived
in
captain
wybrow
gives
way
to
her
passionate
grief
in
solitude
while
this
poor
little
heart
was
being
bruised
with
a
weight
too
heavy
for
it
nature
was
holding
on
her
calm
inexorable
way
in
unmoved
and
terrible
beauty
the
stars
were
rushing
in
their
eternal
courses
the
tides
swelled
to
the
level
of
the
last
expectant
weed
the
sun
was
making
brilliant
day
to
busy
nations
on
the
other
side
of
the
swift
earth
the
stream
of
human
thought
and
deed
was
hurrying
and
broadening
onward
the
astronomer
was
at
his
telescope
the
great
ships
were
labouring
over
the
waves
the
toiling
eagerness
of
commerce
the
fierce
spirit
of
revolution
were
only
ebbing
in
brief
rest
and
sleepless
statesmen
were
dreading
the
possible
crisis
of
the
morrow
what
were
our
little
tina
and
her
trouble
in
this
mighty
torrent
rushing
from
one
awful
unknown
to
another
lighter
than
the
smallest
centre
of
quivering
life
in
the
hidden
and
uncared
for
as
the
pulse
of
anguish
in
the
breast
of
the
tiniest
bird
that
has
fluttered
down
to
its
nest
with
the
food
and
has
found
the
nest
torn
and
empty
there
is
rather
more
incident
in
this
story
of
gilfil
than
in
either
of
the
two
other
of
clerical
life
in
barton
the
narrative
is
of
the
simplest
as
has
already
been
indicated
and
the
elements
from
which
repentance
is
composed
are
as
free
from
any
complex
entanglement
of
plot
the
author
usually
describes
the
most
ordinary
circumstances
of
english
life
but
the
powerful
rendering
of
the
human
emotions
which
spring
from
them
takes
a
most
vivid
hold
of
the
imagination
gilfil
however
seems
a
little
italian
romance
dropped
on
english
soil
it
is
in
brief
the
narration
of
how
sir
christopher
cheverel
and
his
wife
during
their
residence
at
milan
took
pity
on
a
little
orphan
girl
whose
large
dark
eyes
shone
from
out
her
queer
little
face
like
the
precious
stones
in
a
grotesque
image
carved
in
old
ivory
caterina
or
tina
as
she
is
called
taken
back
to
cheverel
manor
grew
up
under
the
care
of
the
baronet
wife
to
whom
she
became
endeared
by
her
exceptional
musical
talent
sir
christopher
had
no
children
but
had
chosen
his
nephew
captain
wybrow
for
his
heir
and
planned
a
marriage
between
him
and
miss
assher
the
handsome
and
accomplished
owner
of
a
pretty
estate
another
marriage
on
which
he
has
equally
set
his
heart
is
that
between
his
ward
maynard
gilfil
an
manly
young
fellow
destined
for
the
church
and
the
tina
for
whom
he
has
long
nursed
an
undeclared
passion
but
alas
for
the
futility
of
human
plans
tina
to
whom
the
elegant
anthony
wybrow
has
been
secretly
professing
love
suffers
tortures
of
jealousy
when
he
and

assher
to
whom
he
has
dutifully
become
engaged

on
a
visit

of

dreams

she
beholds
the
false
lover
stretched
motionless
on

ground
already
having
suddenly
died
of
heart
disease
tina
anguish
is
indescribable
she
gives
the
alarm
to
the
household
but
stung
by
remorse
for
a
contemplated
revenge
of
which
her
nature
was
utterly
incapable
she
flies
unperceived
from
the
premises
at
night
being
searched
for
in
vain
she
is
suspected
of
having
committed
suicide
after
some
days
of
almost
unbearable
suspense
news
is
brought
that
tina
is
lying
ill
at
the
cottage
of
a
former
maid
in
the
household
with
reviving
hopes
her
anxious
lover
rides
to

farm
sees
the
unhappy
girl
and
after
a
while
manages
to
remove
her
to
his
sister
house
she
gradually
recovers
under
heron
gentle
tendance
and
one
day
a
accidental
striking
of
a
deep
bass
note
on
the
harpsichord
suddenly
revives
her
old
passionate
delight
in
music
and
soul
that
was
born
anew
to

was
born
anew
to
love
after
a

tina
agrees
to
become
gilfil
wife
who
has
been
given
the
living
at
shepperton
where
a
happy
future
seems
in
store
for
the
vicar
but
the
delicate
plant
had
been
too
deeply
bruised
and
in
the
struggle
to
put
forth
a
blossom
it
died
tina
died
and
maynard
gilfil
love
went
with
her
into
deep
silence
for
evermore
besides
this
sympathy
with
the
homeliest
characters
and
situations
or
more
properly
speaking
springing
from
it
there
already
runs
through
these
three
tales
the
delicious
vein
of
humour
irradiating
george
eliot
otherwise
sombre
pictures
of
life
with
sudden
flashes
of
mirth
as
of
sunlight
trembling
above
dark
waters
in
this
depth
and
richness
of
humour
george
eliot
not
only
takes
precedence
of
all
other
distinguished
women
but
she
stands
among
them
without
a
rival
hers
is
that
thoughtful
outlook
on
life
that
infinite
depth
of
observation
which
taking
note
of
the
inconsistencies
and
the
blunders
the
and
fantastic
pranks
of
her
finds
the
source
of
laughter
very
near
to
tears
never
going
out
of
her
way
for
the
eccentric
and
peculiar
in
human
nature
seeing
that
human
nature
itself
appears
to
her
as
the
epitome
of
all
incongruity
it
is
this
breadth
of
conception
and
unerringness
of
vision
piercing
through
the
external
and
accidental
to
the
core
of
man
mixed
nature
which
give
certain
of
her
creations
something
of
the
complexity
of
shakespeare
her
power
of
rendering
the
idiom
and
manners
of
peasants
artisans
and
paupers
of
calling
up
before
us
the
very
gestures
and
phrases
of
parsons
country
practitioners
and
other
varieties
of
inhabitants
of
our
provincial
towns
and
rural
districts
already
manifests
itself
fully
in
these
clerical
stories
here
we
find
such
types
as
dempster
the
unscrupulous
brutal
drunken
lawyer
pilgrim
the
tall
heavy
and
spluttering
doctor
profusely
addicted
to
bleeding
and
blistering
his
patients
gilfil
the
eccentric
vicar
with
a
tender
hidden
beneath
his
rugged
exterior
the
unfortunate
janet
rescued
from
moral
ruin
by
tryan
the
ascetic
evangelical
clergyman
whose
character
the
author
remarks
might
have
been
found
sadly
wanting
in
perfection
by
feeble
and
fastidious
minds
but
as
she
adds
the
blessed
work
of
helping
the
world
forward
happily
does
not
wait
to
be
done
by
perfect
men
and
i
should
imagine
that
neither
luther
nor
john
bunyan
for
example
would
have
satisfied
the
modern
demand
for
an
ideal
hero
who
believes
nothing
but
what
is
true
feels
nothing
but
what
is
exalted
and
does
nothing
but
what
is
graceful
the
real
heroes
of
god
making
are
quite
different
they
have
their
natural
heritage
of
love
and
conscience
which
they
drew
in
with
their
mother
milk
they
know
one
or
two
of
those
deep
spiritual
truths
which
are
only
to
be
won
by
long
wrestling
with
their
own
sins
and
their
own
sorrows
they
have
earned
faith
and
strength
so
far
as
they
have
done
genuine
work
but
the
rest
is
dry
barren
theory
blank
prejudice
vague
hearsay
george
eliot
early
acquaintance
with
many
types
of
the
clerical
character
and
her
sympathy
with
the
religious
life
in
all
its
manifestations
was
never
more
fully
shown
than
in
these
in
repentance
we
already
discover
one
of
george
eliot
favourite
psychological
studies
the
awakening
of
a
morally
mixed
nature
to
a
new
a
spiritual
life
this
work
of
regeneration
tryan
performs
for
janet
felix
holt
for
esther
and
daniel
deronda
for
gwendolen
her
protest
against
the
application
of
too
lofty
a
moral
standard
in
judging
of
our
her
championship
of
the
mongrel
ungainly
dogs
who
are
nobody
pets
is
another
of
the
prominent
qualities
of
her
genius
fully
expressed
in
this
firstling
work
being
indeed
at
the
root
of
her
humorous
conception
of
life
one
of
the
finest
bits
of
humour
in
the
present
volume
is
the
scene
in
barton
which
occurs
at
the
workhouse
euphemistically
called
the
college
barton
having
just
finished
his
address
to
the
paupers
is
thus
accosted
by
spratt
a
man
with
a
remarkable
power
of
language
mitigated
by
hesitation
who
piqued
himself
on
expressing
unexceptionable
sentiments
in
unexceptionable
language
on
all
occasions
barton

a

by

but
no

had

uttered
his

than

rushed
forward
and
placed

between

small
eyes
flashed
and
he
was
in
danger
of
uttering
sentiments
not
unexceptionable
before
the
clergyman
but
barton
foreseeing
that
a
prolongation
of
this
episode
would
not
be
to
edification
said
in
his
severest
tones
me
hear
no
abuse
your
boy
is
not
likely
to
behave
well
if
you
set
him
the
example
of
being
saucy
then
stooping
down
to
master
fodge
and
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
you
like
being
beaten
a
what
a
silly
boy
you
are
to
be
naughty
if
you
were
not
naughty
you
would
be
beaten
but
if
you
are
naughty
god
will
be
angry
as
well
as
spratt
and
god
can
burn
you
for
ever
that
will
be
worse
than
being
beaten
master

countenance
was
neither
affirmative
nor
negative
of
this
proposition
continued
barton
you
will
be
a
good

god
will
love
you
and
you
will
grow
up
to
be
a
good

now
let
me
hear
next

that
you
have
been

vision
of
the
benefit
that
would
accrue
to
him
from

chapter

adam
bede
rarely
has
a
novelist
come
to
his
task
with
such
a
culture
such
an
intellectual
grasp
as
george
eliot
we
have
seen
her
girlhood
occupied
with
an
extraordinary
variety
of
studies
we
have
seen
her
plunged
in
abstruse
metaphysical
speculations
we
have
seen
her
translating
some
of
the
most
laborious
philosophical
investigations
of
german
thinkers
we
have
seen
her
again
translating
from
the
latin
the
of
spinoza
and
finally
we
have
seen
her
attracting
and
attracted
by
some
of
the
leaders
in
science
philosophy
and
literature
compared
with
such
qualifications
who
among
novelists
could
compete
what
could
a
dickens
or
a
thackeray
himself
throw
into
the
opposing
scale
lewes
indeed
was
a
match
for
her
in
variety
of
attainments
but
he
had
made
several
attempts
at
fiction
and
the
attempts
had
proved
failures
when
at
last
in
the
maturity
of
her
powers
george
eliot
produced
bede
she
produced
a
novel
in
which
the
amplest
results
of
knowledge
and
meditation
were
so
happily
blended
with
instinctive
insight
into
life
and
character
and
the
rarest
dramatic
imagination
as
to
stamp
it
immediately
as
one
of
the
great
triumphs
and
masterpieces
in
the
world
of
fiction
it
is
worth
noticing
that
in
bede
george
eliot
fulfils
to
the
utmost
the
demands
which
she
had
been
theoretically
advocating
in
her
essays
in
some
of
these
she
had
not
only
eloquently
enforced
the
importance
of
a
truthful
adherence
to
nature
but
had
pointed
out
how
the
artist
is
thus
in
the
very
vanguard
of
social
and
political
reforms
as
in
familiarising
the
imagination
with
the
real
condition
of
the
people
he
did
much
towards
creating
that
sympathy
with
their
wants
their
trials
and
their
sufferings
which
would
eventually
effect
external
changes
in
harmony
with
this
better
understanding
such
had
been
her
teaching
and
in
dickens
she
had
recognised
the
one
great
novelist
who
in
certain
respects
had
painted
the
lower
orders
with
unerring
truthfulness
his
oliver
twists
his
nancys
his
joes
were
terrible
and
pathetic
pictures
of
the
forlorn
outcasts
haunting
our
london
streets
and
if
as
george
eliot
says
dickens
had
been
able
to
give
us
their
psychological
character
their
conception
of
life
and
their
emotions
with
the
same
truth
as
their
idiom
and
manners
his
books
would
be
the
greatest
contribution
art
has
ever
made
to
the
awakening
of
social
sympathies
now
george
eliot
absolutely
does
what
dickens
aimed
at
doing
she
not
merely
seizes
the
outward
and
accidental
traits
of
her
characters
she
pierces
with
unerring
vision
to
the
very
core
of
their
nature
and
enables
us
to
realise
the
peculiarly
subtle
relations
between
character
and
circumstance
her
primary
object
is
to
excite
our
sympathy
with
the
most
ordinary
aspects
of
human
life
with
the
people
that
one
may
meet
any
day
in
the
fields
the
workshops
and
the
homes
of
england
her
most
vivid
creations
are
not
exceptional
beings
not
men
or
women
conspicuous
for
sublime
heroism
of
character
or
magnificent
mental
endowments
but
folk
not
too
fine
or
good
for
human
nature
daily
food
to
this
conscientious
fidelity
of
observation
and
anxious
endeavour
to
report
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
as
of
a
witness
in
a
court
of
justice
are
owing
that
vividness
with
which
the
scenery
and
people
in
bede
seem
projected
on
the
reader
imagination
the
story
indeed
is
so
intensely
realistic
as
to
have
given
rise
to
the
idea
that
it
is
entirely
founded
on
fact
that
there
is
such
a
substratum
is
hardly
a
matter
of
doubt
and
there
have
been
various
publications
all
tending
to
prove
that
the
chief
characters
in
bede
were
not
only
very
faithful
copies
of
living
people
but
of
people
closely
connected
with
its
author
to
some
extent
this
is
incontrovertible
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
likelihood
of
the
fictitious
events
having
in
their
turn
been
grafted
on
to
actual
personages
and
occurrences
till
the
whole
has
become
so
fused
together
as
to
lead
some
persons
to
the
firm
conviction
that
dinah
morris
is
absolutely
identical
with
elizabeth
evans
the
derbyshire
methodist
such
a
supposition
would
help
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
statements
respectively
made
by
the
great
novelist
and
the
writers
of
two
curious
little
books
entitled
bede
the
methody
his
life
and
labours
chiefly
written
by
himself
and
eliot
in
derbyshire
by
guy
roslyn
from
these
brochures
one
gathers
that
hayslope
where
the
rustic
drama
of
bede
unfolds
itself
is
the
village
of
ellaston
not
far
from
ashbourne
in
staffordshire
this
village
is
so
little
altered
that
the
traveller
may
still
see
the
of
the
donnithorne
arms
and
the
red
brick
hall
only
with
windows
no
longer
unpatched
samuel
william
and
robert
evans
the
father
of
the
novelist
were
born
in
this
place
and
began
life
as
carpenters
as
their
father
before
them
samuel
evans
became
a
zealous
methodist
and
was
rather
laughed
at
by
his
family
in
consequence
for
he
says
my
elder
brothers
often
tried
to
tease
me
they
entertained
high
church
principles
they
told
me
what
great
blunders
i
made
in
preaching
and
prayer
that
i
had
more
zeal
than
knowledge
in
this
as
in
other
respects
he
is
the
prototype
of
seth
as
adam
resembles
robert
evans
one
of
the
more
secular
elder
brothers
only
that
in
real
life
it
was
samuel
who
married
elizabeth
the
dinah
morris
of
fiction
much
has
been
written
about
this
elizabeth
evans
the
aunt
of
george
eliot
already
spoken
of
indeed
her
life
was
one
of
such
rare
devotion
to
an
ideal
cause
that
even
such
imperfect
fragments
of
it
as
have
been
committed
to
writing
by
herself
or
her
friends
are
of
considerable
interest
elizabeth
was
born
at
newbold
in
leicestershire
and
left
her
father
house
when
little
more
than
fourteen
years
old
she
joined
the
methodists
in
after
which
she
had
entirely
done
with
the
pleasures
of
the
world
and
all
her
old
companions
i
saw
it
my
duty
she
says
to
leave
off
all
my
superfluities
of
dress
hence
i
pulled
off
all
my
bunches
cut
off
my
curls
left
off
my
lace
and
in
this
i
found
an
unspeakable
pleasure
i
saw
i
could
make
a
better
use
of
my
time
and
money
than
to
follow
the
fashions
of
a
vain
world
while
still
a
beautiful
young
girl
attired
in
a
quaker
dress
and
bonnet
she
used
to
walk
across
those
bleak
derbyshire
hills
looking
so
strangely
mournful
in
their
treeless
nudity
with
their
bare
stone
fences
grey
against
a
greyer
sky
here
she
trudged
from
village
to
village
gathering
the
poor
about
her
and
pouring
forth
words
of
such
earnest
conviction
that
as
she
says
many
were
brought
to
the
lord
the
points
of
resemblance
between
her
career
and
that
of
dinah
morris
can
not
fail
to
strike
the
reader
even
their
phraseology
being
often
singularly
alike
as
when
evans
writes
in
the
short
account
of
what
she
calls
her
unprofitable
life
i
saw
it
my
duty
to
be
wholly
devoted
to
god
and
to
be
set
apart
for
the
master
use
while
dinah
says
my
life
is
too
short
and
god
work
is
too
great
for
me
to
think
of
making
a
home
for
myself
in
this
world
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
these
similarities
of
expression
are
natural
enough
when
one
considers
that
dinah
is
a
type
of
the
same
kind
of
methodism
to
which
evans
belonged
what
is
perhaps
stranger
is
that
the
account
given
by
george
eliot
of
her
various
meetings
with
her
aunt
elizabeth
evans
should
differ
considerably
from
what
the
latter
herself
remembered
or
has
stated
about
them
shortly
after
the
appearance
of
bede
attention
had
been
publicly
called
to
the
identity
of
the
heroine
of
fiction
with
the
methodist
preacher
this
conviction
was
so
strong
in
wirksworth
that
a
number
of
friends
placed
a
memorial
tablet
in
the
methodist
chapel
at
wirksworth
with
the
following
inscription
erected
by
grateful
friends
in
memory
of
elizabeth
evans
known
to
the
world
as
dinah
bede
who
during
many
years
proclaimed
alike
in
the
open
air
the
sanctuary
and
from
house
to
house
the
love
of
christ
she
died
in
the
lord
may
aged
years
in
order
to
give
a
correct
notion
of
the
amount
of
truth
in
her
novel
george
eliot
wrote
in
the
following
terms
to
her
friend
miss
hennell
on
the
of
october
i
should
like
while
the
subject
is
vividly
present
with
me
to
tell
you
more
exactly
than
i
have
ever
yet
done
i
knew
of
my
aunt
elizabeth
evans
my
father
you
know
lived
in
warwickshire
all
my
life
with
him
having
finally
left
staffordshire
first
and
then
derbyshire
six
or
seven
years
before
he
married
my
mother
there
was
hardly
any
intercourse
between
my
father
family
resident
in
derbyshire
and
staffordshire
and
our
family
few
and
far
between
visits
of
to
my
childish
feeling
strange
uncles
and
aunts
and
cousins
from
my
father
native
county
and
once
a
journey
of
my
own
as
a
little
child
with
my
father
and
mother
to
see
my
uncle
william
a
rich
builder
in
staffordshire
but
my
uncle
and
aunt
samuel
so
far
as
i
can
recall
the
dim
outline
of
things
are
what
i
remember
of
northerly
relatives
in
my
childhood
but
when
i
was
seventeen
or
more
after
my
sister
was
married
and
i
was
mistress
of
the
house
my
father
took
a
journey
into
derbyshire
in
which
visiting
my
uncle
and
aunt
samuel
who
were
very
poor
and
lived
in
a
humble
cottage
at
wirksworth
he
found
my
aunt
in
a
very
delicate
state
of
health
after
a
serious
illness
and
to
do
her
bodily
good
he
persuaded
her
to
return
with
him
telling
her
that
should
be
very
very
happy
to
have
her
with
me
for
a
few
weeks
i
was
then
strongly
under
the
influence
of
evangelical
belief
and
earnestly
endeavouring
to
shape
this
anomalous
life
of
ours
into
some
consistency
with
the
spirit
and
simple
verbal
tenor
of
the
new
testament
i
delighted
to
see
my
aunt
although
i
had
only
heard
her
spoken
of
as
a
strange
person
given
to
a
fanatical
vehemence
of
exhortation
in
private
as
well
as
public
i
believed
that
i
should
find
sympathy
between
us
she
was
then
an
old
woman
above
sixty
and
i
believe
had
for
a
good
many
years
given
up
preaching
a
tiny
little
woman
with
bright
small
dark
eyes
and
hair
that
had
been
black
i
imagine
but
was
now
grey
a
pretty
woman
in
her
youth
but
of
a
totally
different
physical
type
from
dinah
the
difference
as
you
will
believe
was
not
physical
no
difference
is
she
was
a
woman
of
strong
natural
excitability
which
i
know
from
the
description
i
have
heard
my
father
and
give
prevented
her
from
the
exercise
of
discretion
under
the
promptings
of
her
zeal
but
this
vehemence
was
now
subdued
by
age
and
sickness
she
was
very
gentle
and
quiet
in
her
manners
very
loving
and
what
she
must
have
been
from
the
very
first
a
truly
religious
soul
in
whom
the
love
of
god
and
love
of
man
were
fused
together
there
was
nothing
rightly
distinctive
in
her
religious
conversation
i
had
had
much
intercourse
with
pious
dissenters
before
the
only
freshness
i
found
in
her
talk
came
from
the
fact
that
she
had
been
the
greater
part
of
her
life
a
wesleyan
and
though
left
the
society
when
women
were
no
longer
allowed
to
and
joined
the
new
wesleyans
she
retained
the
character
of
thought
that
belongs
to
the
genuine
old
wesleyan
i
had
never
talked
with
a
wesleyan
before
and
we
used
to
have
little
debates
about
predestination
for
i
was
then
a
strong
calvinist
here
her
superiority
came
out
and
i
remember
now
with
loving
admiration
one
thing
which
at
the
time
i
disapproved
it
was
not
strictly
a
consequence
of
her
arminian
belief
and
at
first
sight
might
seem
opposed
to
it
yet
it
came
from
the
spirit
of
love
which
clings
to
the
bad
logic
of
arminianism
when
my
uncle
came
to
fetch
her
after
she
had
been
with
us
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
he
was
speaking
of
a
deceased
minister
once
greatly
respected
who
from
the
action
of
trouble
upon
him
had
taken
to
small
tippling
though
otherwise
not
culpable
i
hope
the
good
man
in
heaven
for
all
that
said
my
uncle
yes
said
my
aunt
with
a
deep
inward
groan
of
joyful
conviction
a
in
heaven
that
sure
this
was
at
the
time
an
offence
to
my
stern
ascetic
hard
views
how
beautiful
it
is
to
me
now
as
to
my
aunt
conversation
it
is
a
fact
that
the
only
two
things
of
any
interest
i
remember
in
our
lonely
sittings
and
walks
are
her
telling
me
one
sunny
afternoon
how
she
had
with
another
pious
woman
visited
an
unhappy
girl
in
prison
stayed
with
her
all
night
and
gone
with
her
to
execution
and
one
or
two
accounts
of
supposed
miracles
in
which
she
believed
among
the
rest
face
with
the
crown
of
thorns
seen
in
the
in
her
account
of
the
prison
scenes
i
remember
no
word
she
uttered
i
only
remember
her
tone
and
manner
and
the
deep
feeling
i
had
under
the
recital
of
the
girl
she
knew
nothing
i
believe
or
told
me
nothing
but
that
she
was
a
common
coarse
girl
convicted
of
the
incident
lay
in
my
mind
for
years
on
years
as
a
dead
germ
apparently
till
time
had
made
my
mind
a
nidus
in
which
it
could
fructify
it
then
turned
out
to
be
the
germ
of
bede
i
saw
my
aunt
twice
after
this
once
i
spent
a
day
and
night
with
my
father
in
the
wirksworth
cottage
sleeping
with
my
aunt
i
remember
our
interview
was
less
interesting
than
in
the
former
time
i
think
i
was
less
simply
devoted
to
religious
ideas
and
once
again
she
came
with
my
uncle
to
see
me
when
father
and
i
were
living
at
foleshill
there
was
some
pain
for
i
had
given
up
the
form
of
christian
belief
and
was
in
a
crude
state
of
freethinking
she
stayed
about
three
or
four
days
i
think
this
is
all
i
remember
distinctly
as
matter
i
could
write
down
of
my
dear
aunt
whom
i
really
loved
you
see
how
she
suggested
but
it
is
not
possible
you
should
see
as
i
do
how
entirely
her
individuality
differed
from
how
curious
it
seems
to
me
that
people
should
think
sermon
prayers
and
speeches
were
when
they
were
written
with
hot
tears
as
they
surged
up
in
my
own
mind
as
to
my
indebtedness
to
facts
of
local
and
personal
history
of
a
small
kind
connected
with
staffordshire
and
derbyshire
you
may
imagine
of
what
kind
that
is
when
i
tell
you
that
i
never
remained
in
either
of
those
counties
more
than
a
few
days
together
and
of
only
two
such
visits
have
i
more
than
a
shadowy
interrupted
recollection
the
details
which
i
know
as
facts
and
have
made
use
of
for
my
picture
were
gathered
from
such
imperfect
allusion
and
narrative
as
i
heard
from
my
father
in
his
occasional
talk
about
old
times
as
to
my
aunt
children
or
grandchildren
saying
if
they
say
that
is
a
good
portrait
of
my
aunt
that
is
simply
the
vague
notion
people
always
have
of
portraits
it
is
not
surprising
that
simple
men
and
women
without
pretension
to
enlightened
discrimination
should
think
a
generic
resemblance
constitutes
a
portrait
when
we
see
the
great
public
so
accustomed
to
be
delighted
with
of
life
and
character
which
they
accept
as
representations
that
they
are
scandalised
when
art
makes
a
nearer
approach
to
truth
perhaps
i
am
doing
a
superfluous
thing
in
writing
all
this
to
you
but
i
am
prompted
to
do
it
by
the
feeling
that
in
future
years
bede
and
all
that
concerns
it
may
have
become
a
dim
portion
of
the
past
and
that
i
may
not
be
able
to
recall
so
much
of
the
truth
as
i
have
now
told
you
nothing
could
prove
more
conclusively
how
powerful
was
the
impression
which
bede
created
than
this
controversy
concerning
the
amount
of
truth
which
its
characters
contained
but
as
hinted
before
it
seems
very
likely
that
some
of
the
doings
and
sayings
of
the
fictitious
personages
should
have
been
attributed
almost
unconsciously
to
the
real
people
whom
they
resembled
how
quick
is
the
popular
imagination
in
effecting
these
transformations
came
only
quite
recently
under
my
notice
when
some
english
travellers
while
visiting
château
were
taken
by
the
guide
in
perfect
good
faith
to
see
the
actual
dungeon
where
monte
christo
was
imprisoned
similarly
one
would
think
that
the
moving
sermon
preached
by
dinah
on
the
green
at
hayslope
had
been
afterwards
erroneously
ascribed
to
elizabeth
evans
but
an
account
recently
published
in
the
by
one
who
had
long
known
the
evanses
of
wirksworth
seems
irreconcilable
with
such
a
supposition
according
to
this
writer
it
would
appear
that
besides
the
visits
to
her
aunt
at
wirksworth
of
which
george
eliot
speaks
in
the
letter
just
quoted
there
was
one
other
of
which
no
mention
is
made
this
visit
which
she
paid
her
cousin
samuel
evans
occurred
in
when
she
remained
a
week
at
his
house
in
wirksworth
the
aunt
and
niece
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
each
other
every
day
for
several
hours
at
this
time
they
usually
met
at
the
house
of
one
of
the
married
daughters
of
elizabeth
evans
holding
long
conversations
while
sitting
by
themselves
in
the
parlour
these
secret
conversations
says
the
writer
of
the
article
excited
some
curiosity
in
the
family
and
one
day
one
of
the
daughters
said
i
ca
think
what
thee
and
mary
ann
have
got
to
talk
about
so
much
to
which
evans
replied
my
dear
i
do
know
what
she
wants
but
she
gets
me
to
tell
her
all
about
my
life
and
my
religious
experience
and
she
puts
it
all
down
in
a
little
book
i
ca
make
out
what
she
wants
it
for
after
her
departure
evans
is
reported
to
have
said
to
her
daughter
oh
dear
mary
ann
has
got
one
thing
i
did
not
mean
her
to
take
away
and
that
is
the
notes
of
the
first
sermon
i
preached
at
ellaston
green
according
to
the
same
authority
marian
evans
took
notes
of
everything
people
said
in
her
hearing
no
matter
who
was
speaking
down
it
went
into
the
which
seemed
never
out
of
her
hand
and
these
notes
she
is
said
to
have
transcribed
every
night
before
going
to
bed
yet
this
habit
was
foreign
to
her
whole
character
and
the
friends
who
knew
her
most
intimately
in
youth
and
later
life
never
remember
seeing
her
resort
to
such
a
practice
be
that
as
it
may
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
novelist
very
freely
used
many
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
her
remarkable
career
how
closely
she
adhered
to
nature
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
poyser
and
bartle
massey
she
retained
the
actual
names
of
the
characters
portrayed
as
they
happened
to
be
both
dead
bartle
massey
the
village
cynic
had
been
the
schoolmaster
of
her
father
robert
evans
how
accurately
the
latter
together
with
all
his
surroundings
was
described
is
shown
by
the
following
anecdote
on
its
first
appearance
bede
was
read
aloud
to
an
old
man
an
intimate
associate
of
robert
evans
in
his
staffordshire
days
this
man
knew
nothing
concerning
either
author
or
subject
beforehand
and
his
astonishment
was
boundless
on
recognising
so
many
friends
and
incidents
of
his
own
youth
portrayed
with
unerring
fidelity
he
sat
up
half
the
night
listening
to
the
story
in
breathless
excitement
now
and
then
slapping
his
knee
as
he
exclaimed
that
robert
that
robert
to
the
life
although
wirksworth
is
not
the
locality
described
in
bede
it
contains
features
recalling
that
quaint
little
where
over
the
door
of
one
of
the
houses
may
be
read
the
name
made
illustrious
by
the
inimitable
poyser
in
the
neighbourhood
too
are
arkwright
mills
there
at
cromford
casually
alluded
to
by
adam
bede
and
should
the
tourist
happen
to
enter
one
of
the
cottages
of
grey
stone
with
door
and
he
may
still
alight
on
specimens
of
methodism
as
devout
as
seth
bede
eloquently
expounding
the
latest
political
event
by
some
prophecy
of
daniel
or
ezekiel
in
short
one
breathes
the
atmosphere
in
which
such
characters
as
dinah
and
seth
actually
lived
and
had
their
being
this
uncompromising
realism
so
far
from
detracting
only
enhances
the
genius
of
this
powerful
novel
a
thousand
writers
might
have
got
hold
of
these
identical
materials
a
george
eliot
alone
could
have
cast
these
materials
into
the
mould
of
bede
let
any
one
glance
at
the
account
of
their
religious
experiences
as
given
by
elizabeth
or
samuel
evans
and
he
will
realise
all
the
more
strongly
how
great
was
the
genius
of
her
who
transfused
these
rambling
commonplace
effusions
into
such
an
artistic
whole
i
have
entered
so
minutely
into
this
question
of
the
likeness
between
the
actual
characters
and
those
in
the
novel
purely
on
account
of
the
biographical
interest
attaching
to
it
in
judging
of
bede
as
a
work
of
art
these
facts
possess
next
to
no
importance
if
we
could
trace
the
characters
in
any
one
of
shakespeare
plays
to
human
beings
actually
connected
with
the
poet
we
should
consider
such
a
discovery
immensely
valuable
as
throwing
new
light
on
his
own
life
though
it
would
hardly
affect
our
critical
estimate
of
the
drama
itself
so
much
has
been
said
already
about
the
characters
in
bede
in
connection
with
the
real
people
they
resemble
that
little
need
be
added
here
about
them
dinah
morris
the
youthful
preacher
whose
eloquence
is
but
the
natural
almost
involuntary
manifestation
in
words
of
a
beautiful
soul
whose
spring
of
love
is
so
abundant
that
it
overflows
the
narrow
limits
of
private
affection
and
blesses
multitudes
of
toiling
suffering
men
and
women
with
its
wealth
of
pity
hope
and
sympathy
was
a
new
creation
in
the
world
of
fiction
some
writer
has
pointed
out
a
certain
analogy
between
the
sweet
derbyshire
methodist
and
the
gentle
pietist
whose
confessions
form
a
very
curious
chapter
of
meister
but
the
two
characters
are
too
dissimilar
for
comparison
the
german
heroine
is
a
dreamy
passive
introspective
nature
feeling
much
but
doing
little
whereas
the
english
preacher
does
not
inquire
too
curiously
into
the
mysteries
of
her
faith
but
moved
by
the
spirit
of
its
teaching
goes
about
actively
participating
in
the
lives
of
others
by
her
rousing
words
and
her
acts
of
charity
only
a
woman
would
or
could
have
described
just
such
a
woman
as
this
a
woman
whose
heart
is
centred
in
an
impersonal
ideal
instead
of
in
any
individual
object
of
love
whereas
a
man
heroine
always
has
her
existence
rooted
in
some
personal
affection
or
passion
whether
for
parent
or
lover
child
or
husband
this
makes
dinah
less
romantically
interesting
than
hetty
sorrel
the
beautiful
kittenlike
creature
with
whom
she
is
so
happily
contrasted
george
eliot
never
drew
a
more
living
figure
than
this
of
hetty
hiding
such
a
hard
little
heart
under
that
soft
dimpling
beauty
of
hers
again
i
think
that
only
a
woman
would
have
depicted
just
such
a
hetty
as
this
the
personal
charms
of
this
young
girl
are
drawn
in
words
that
have
the
glow
of
life
itself
yet
while
intensely
conscious
of
her
beauty
we
are
kept
aware
all
the
time
that
to
use
one
of
the
famous
poyser
epigrammatic
sayings
hetty
is
no
better
nor
a
cherry
wi
a
hard
stone
inside
it
george
eliot
is
never
dazzled
or
led
away
by
her
own
bewitching
creation
as
a
man
would
have
been
there
is
a
certain
pitilessness
in
her
analysis
of
hetty
shallow
frivolous
little
soul
almost
as
if
she
were
saying
see
here
what
stuff
this
beauty
which
you
adore
is
made
of
in
reality
to
quote
her
own
subtle
interpretation
of
beauty
hetty
face
had
a
language
that
transcended
her
feelings
there
are
faces
which
nature
charges
with
a
meaning
and
pathos
not
belonging
to
the
simple
human
soul
that
flutters
beneath
them
but
speaking
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
foregone
generations
eyes
that
tell
of
deep
love
which
doubtless
has
been
and
is
somewhere
but
not
paired
with
these
eyes
perhaps
paired
with
pale
eyes
that
can
say
nothing
just
as
a
national
language
may
be
instinct
with
poetry
unfelt
by
the
lips
that
use
it
the
sensation
created
by
bede
was
shown
in
other
ways
besides
the
claim
of
some
to
have
discovered
the
original
characters
of
this
striking
novel
the
curiosity
of
the
public
was
naturally
much
exercised
as
to
who
the
unknown
author
could
possibly
be
who
had
so
suddenly
leaped
into
fame
and
now
there
comes
on
the
scene
an
individual
who
does
not
claim
to
be
the
living
model
of
one
of
the
characters
portrayed
but
to
be
the
author
of
the
book
himself
and
the
name
of
this
person
was
liggins
while
the
of
clerical
life
were
yet
appearing
in
the
inhabitants
of
nuneaton
and
its
neighbourhood
were
considerably
perplexed
and
excited
to
find
places
and
persons
touched
off
to
the
life
in
amos
barton
they
recognised
the
incumbent
of
coton
church
in
pilgrim
a
medical
man
familiar
to
every
child
in
the
town
and
indeed
in
every
one
of
the
characters
an
equally
unmistakable
portrait
clearly
no
one
but
a
could
have
hit
off
these
wonderful
likenesses
literary
talent
not
being
too
abundant
their
choice
of
an
author
was
limited
the
only
man
who
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
seemed
to
have
the
making
of
a
man
of
letters
in
him
was
this
liggins
to
have
studied
at
cambridge
gallantly
run
through
a
fortune
and
be
in
very
needy
circumstances
were
exactly
the
qualifications
to
be
expected
in
a
man
of
genius
further
evidence
seeming
unnecessary
the
real
authorship
of
the
was
now
revealed
in
an
isle
of
man
paper
at
first
the
reputed
author
gently
denied
the
impeachment
but
on
the
appearance
of
bede
he
succumbed
to
the
temptation
to
be
fêted
at
dinner
parties
as
a
successful
author
and
to
have
a
subscription
set
on
foot
by
enthusiastic
and
in
whose
eyes
he
was
a
sadly
unrequited
genius
proved
irresistible
a
local
clergyman
even
wrote
to
the
stating
liggins
to
be
the
real
surname
of
george
eliot
the
latter
wrote
of
course
denying
the
statement
and
challenging
the
pretender
to
produce
some
specimen
of
his
writing
in
the
style
of
bede
but
the
confidence
of
the
nuneaton
public
in
their
hero
liggins
was
not
to
be
so
easily
shaken
two
dissenting
ministers
from
coventry
went
over
to
attleborough
to
call
upon
the
great
author
and
to
find
out
if
he
really
did
write
bede
liggins
evaded
their
questions
indirectly
admitting
that
he
did
but
when
they
asked
him
point
blank
liggins
tell
us
you
write
bede
he
said
if
i
did
the
devil
did
and
that
was
all
they
could
get
out
of
him
another
clergyman
was
much
less
sceptical
assuring
every
one
that
he
was
positive
as
to
liggins
being
the
author
as
he
had
seen
the
of
bede
in
his
hands
to
this
day
there
lives
in
the
isle
of
man
a
certain
venerable
old
gentleman
who
has
never
lost
his
faith
in
liggins
but
when
george
eliot
is
mentioned
gravely
shakes
his
head
implying
that
there
is
more
in
the
name
than
meets
the
eye
of
the
superficial
observer
but
a
heavy
retribution
befell
the
poor
at
last
for
when
his
false
pretences
to
favour
were
fully
manifest
he
fell
into
utter
neglect
and
poverty
ending
his
days
in
the
workhouse
this
foolish
misrepresentation
hastened
the
disclosure
of
george
real
personality
and
name
which
occurred
on
the
publication
of
the
on
the
floss
shortly
before
that
blackwood
who
had
long
entertained
the
wish
to
know
the
author
of
the
of
clerical
and
of
bede
was
invited
by
lewes
to
meet
him
at
last
no
one
was
present
at
the
besides
lewes
marian
and
blackwood
himself
the
dinner
was
an
extremely
pleasant
one
but
when
it
was
over
the
guest
could
not
help
expressing
his
regret
that
george
eliot
himself
should
not
have
been
present
here
he
is
said
lewes
introducing
the
quiet
lady
who
had
presided
at
table
not
without
enjoyment
at
the
sensation
he
produced
as
the
astonished
publisher
shook
hands
with
his
contributor
chapter
ix
the
mill
on
the
floss
while
the
public
had
been
trying
to
discover
who
the
mysterious
george
eliot
could
possibly
be
one
person
there
was
who
immediately
penetrated
the
disguise
and
felt
positive
as
to
the
identity
of
the
author
on
reading
the
and
especially
bede
he
was
convinced
that
no
one
but
a
member
of
his
own
family
could
have
written
these
stories
he
recognised
incidents
touches
a
saying
here
or
there
just
the
things
that
no
one
outside
his
own
home
could
by
any
chance
have
come
upon
but
george
eliot
brother
kept
this
discovery
closely
locked
within
his
own
breast
he
trembled
lest
any
one
else
should
discover
the
secret
fearing
the
outcry
of
neighbours
who
might
not
always
feel
that
the
author
had
represented
them
in
colours
sufficiently
flattering
when
the
on
the
floss
appeared
however
the
veil
was
lifted
and
people
heard
that
george
eliot
had
once
been
a
miss
marian
evans
who
came
from
the
neighbourhood
of
nuneaton
in
warwickshire
to
her
brother
isaac
alone
this
was
no
news
as
he
had
detected
his
sister
in
the
first
of
the
the
of
tom
and
maggie
tulliver
was
in
many
respects
an
autobiography
and
no
biographer
can
ever
hope
to
describe
the
early
history
of
george
eliot
as
she
herself
has
done
in
the
on
the
floss
how
many
joys
and
griefs
of
those
happy
careless
days
must
have
been
recalled
to
her
brother
those
days
when
little
mary
ann
had
sat
poring
over
daniel
defoe
of
the
devil
or
sought
refuge
in
the
attic
at
griff
house
after
a
quarrel
with
him
this
attic
was
maggie
favourite
retreat
on
a
wet
day
when
the
weather
was
not
too
cold
here
she
fretted
out
all
her
and
talked
aloud
to
the
floors
and
the
shelves
and
the
dark
rafters
festooned
with
cobwebs
and
here
she
kept
a
fetish
which
she
punished
for
all
her
misfortunes
this
was
the
trunk
of
a
large
wooden
doll
which
once
stared
with
the
roundest
of
eyes
above
the
reddest
of
cheeks
but
was
now
entirely
defaced
by
a
long
career
of
vicarious
suffering
three
nails
driven
into
the
head
commemorated
as
many
crises
in
maggie
nine
years
of
earthly
struggle
that
luxury
of
vengeance
having
been
suggested
to
her
by
the
picture
of
jael
destroying
sisera
in
the
old
bible
again
at
some
fields
distance
from
their
old
home
there
had
been
a
round
pool
called
the
moat
almost
a
perfect
round
framed
in
with
willows
and
tall
reeds
so
that
the
water
was
only
to
be
seen
when
you
got
close
to
the
brink
this
was
a
favourite
resort
of
isaac
and
mary
ann
as
also
of
tom
and
his
sister
when
they
went
fishing
together
and
maggie
thought
it
probable
that
the
small
fish
would
come
to
her
hook
and
the
large
ones
to
tom
the
red
deeps
too
where
maggie
loved
to
walk
in
june
when
the
were
in
their
glory
and
where
she
lived
through
many
phases
of
her
shifting
inner
life
was
in
the
same
vicinity
and
at
one
time
a
beloved
haunt
of
the
future
novelist
but
although
some
of
the
spots
mentioned
in
the
on
the
have
been
easily
identified
as
connected
with
george
eliot
early
home
the
scenery
of
that
novel
is
mainly
laid
in
lincolnshire
oggs
with
its
roofs
and
broad
warehouse
gables
is
the
ancient
town
of
gainsborough
the
floss
is
a
tidal
river
like
the
trent
and
in
each
case
the
rushing
up
the
river
with
its
terrific
wave
and
flooding
the
land
for
miles
round
is
known
as
the
eagre
a
name
not
a
little
descriptive
of
the
thing
itself
the
on
the
floss
a
title
adopted
by
the
author
at
the
suggestion
of
blackwood
in
preference
to
maggie
is
the
most
poetical
of
george
eliot
novels
the
great
floss
hurrying
between
green
pastures
to
the
sea
gives
a
unity
of
its
own
to
this
story
which
opens
to
the
roar
of
waters
the
weltering
waters
which
accompany
it
at
the
close
it
forms
the
elemental
background
which
rounds
the
little
lives
of
the
family
group
nurtured
on
its
banks
the
childhood
of
tom
and
maggie
tulliver
is
inextricably
blended
with
this
swift
river
the
traditions
of
which
have
been
to
them
as
fairy
tales
its
haunting
presence
is
more
or
less
with
them
throughout
their
chequered
existence
and
when
pride
and
passion
when
shame
and
sorrow
have
divided
the
brother
and
sister
pursued
as
by
some
tragic
fate
the
floss
seems
to
rise
in
sympathy
and
submerges
them
in
its
mighty
waters
to
unite
them
once
more
in
an
embrace
never
to
be
parted
it
can
not
fail
to
strike
the
reader
that
in
almost
every
one
of
george
eliot
novels
there
occurs
a
death
by
drowning
as
in
the
instance
of
thias
bede
of
dunstan
cass
of
henleigh
grandcourt
and
nearly
in
that
of
tito
this
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
as
a
child
the
novelist
became
acquainted
with
the
sudden
death
of
a
near
relative
who
had
accidentally
fallen
into
a
stream
an
incident
which
sunk
deeply
into
her
retentive
mind
fate
plays
a
very
conspicuous
part
in
this
as
in
most
of
george
novels
but
it
is
not
the
fate
of
the
greeks
it
is
not
a
power
that
affects
human
existence
from
without
it
rather
lies
at
the
root
of
it
more
or
less
shaping
that
existence
according
to
obscure
inherited
tendencies
and
in
the
collision
between
character
and
circumstance
between
passion
and
law
potent
only
in
proportion
as
the
individual
finally
issues
conquered
or
a
conqueror
from
the
struggle
of
life
this
action
of
character
on
circumstance
and
of
circumstance
on
character
is
an
with
george
eliot
we
constantly
see
adverse
circumstances
modifying
and
moulding
the
lives
of
the
actors
in
her
stories
she
has
hardly
if
ever
therefore
drawn
a
hero
or
heroine
for
these
instead
of
yielding
make
circumstances
yield
to
them
dorothea
and
lydgate
in
abandoning
their
striving
after
the
highest
kind
of
life
tito
in
invariably
yielding
to
the
most
pleasurable
prompting
of
the
moment
gwendolen
in
being
mainly
influenced
by
circumstances
acting
on
her
without
her
reacting
on
them
are
all
types
of
this
kind
maggie
belongs
on
the
whole
to
the
same
type
she
too
is
what
goethe
calls
a
problematic
nature
a
nature
which
along
with
vast
possibilities
and
lofty
aspirations
lacks
a
certain
fixity
of
purpose
and
drifting
helplessly
from
one
extreme
to
another
is
shattered
almost
as
soon
as
it
has
put
out
of
port
in
maggie
case
this
evil
springs
from
the
very
fulness
of
her
nature
from
the
acuteness
of
an
imagination
which
the
of
life
attracts
by
turns
in
the
most
opposite
directions
tom
on
the
other
hand
with
his
narrow
practical
understanding
entirely
concentrated
on
the
business
in
hand
swerves
neither
to
right
nor
left
because
he
may
be
said
to
resemble
a
horse
with
blinkers
in
that
he
sees
only
the
road
straight
ahead
maggie
with
all
her
palpable
weaknesses
and
startling
inconsistencies
is
the
most
adorable
of
george
eliot
women
in
all
poetry
and
fiction
there
is
no
child
more
delicious
than
the
little
wench
with
her
loving
heart
and
dreamy
ways
her
rash
impulses
and
wild
regrets
her
fine
susceptibilities
and
fiery
jets
of
temper
in
a
word
her
singularly
fresh
and
vital
nature
the
same
charm
pervades
every
phase
of
her
life
in
her
case
the
child
if
i
may
so
far
modify
wordsworth
famous
saying
is
eminently
the
mother
of
the
woman
profoundly
affectionate
by
nature
and
sympathising
as
she
does
with
her
father
in
his
calamity
she
can
not
help
rebelling
at
the
sordid
narrowness
of
her
daily
life
passionately
craving
for
a
wider
field
wherein
to
develop
her
inborn
faculties
in
this
state
of
yearning
and
wild
unrest
her
accidental
reading
of
thomas
à
kempis
forms
a
crisis
in
her
life
by
bringing
about
a
spiritual
awakening
in
which
christianity
for
the
first
time
becomes
a
living
truth
to
her
intense
as
she
is
maggie
now
throws
all
the
ardour
of
her
nature
into
renunciation
and
she
seeks
her
highest
satisfaction
in
abnegation
of
all
personal
desire
and
in
entire
devotion
to
others
in
her
young
asceticism
she
relinquishes
a
world
of
which
she
is
ignorant
stifling
every
impulse
however
innocent
that
seems
opposed
to
her
new
faith
but
maggie
has
more
actual
affinity
with
poets
and
artists
than
with
saints
and
martyrs
her
soul
thrills
like
a
instrument
to
the
beauty
of
the
world
around
her
and
though
she
doubts
whether
there
may
not
even
be
a
sinfulness
in
the
indulgence
of
this
enjoyment
yet
the
summer
flowers
and
the
summer
sunshine
put
her
scruples
to
flight
and
then
when
through
the
intervention
of
philip
wakem
the
enchantments
of
romance
and
poetry
are
brought
within
her
reach
the
glory
of
the
world
again
lays
hold
of
her
imagination
and
a
fresh
conflict
is
begun
in
her
soul
thus
she
drifts
from
one
state
into
another
most
opposed
to
it
and
to
an
outside
observer
such
as
tom
her
abrupt
transitions
are
a
sign
that
she
is
utterly
wanting
in
moral
stamina
not
only
tom
but
many
eminent
critics
who
have
descanted
with
fond
partiality
on
maggie
early
life
seem
to
be
shocked
by
that
part
of
her
story
in
which
she
allows
herself
to
fall
passionately
in
love
with
such
an
ordinary
specimen
of
manhood
as
stephen
guest
the
author
has
even
been
accused
of
violating
the
truth
of
nature
inasmuch
as
such
a
woman
as
maggie
could
never
have
inclined
to
so
vulgar
so
commonplace
a
man
as
her
lover
others
while
not
questioning
the
truth
of
the
character
find
fault
with
the
poor
heroine
herself
whom
they
pronounce
an
ineffective
nature
revealing
its
innate
unsoundness
by
the
crowning
error
of
an
abject
passion
for
so
poor
a
creature
as
the
dandy
of
oggs
this
contention
only
proves
the
singular
vitality
of
the
character
itself
and
nothing
is
more
psychologically
true
in
george
eliot
studies
of
character
than
this
love
of
the
heroine
for
a
man
who
has
no
corresponding
fineness
of
fibre
in
his
nature
his
attraction
lying
entirely
in
the
magnetism
of
mutual
passion
this
vitality
places
maggie
tulliver
by
the
side
of
the
juliets
the
mignons
the
consuelos
the
becky
sharps
and
other
airy
inheritors
of
immortality
it
is
curious
that
swinburne
in
view
of
such
a
character
as
this
or
indeed
bearing
in
mind
a
silas
marner
a
dolly
winthrop
a
tito
and
other
intrinsically
living
reproductions
of
human
nature
should
describe
george
eliot
as
intellectually
constructed
characters
in
contrast
to
charlotte
brontë
creations
the
former
according
to
him
being
the
result
of
intellect
the
latter
of
genius
if
ever
character
came
simply
dropped
out
of
the
mould
of
nature
it
is
that
of
maggie
his
assumption
that
the
on
the
floss
can
in
any
sense
have
been
suggested
by
or
partially
based
upon
story
of
moorland
cottage
seems
equally
baseless
there
is
certainly
the
identity
of
name
in
the
heroines
and
some
resemblance
of
situation
as
regards
portions
of
the
story
but
both
the
name
and
the
situation
are
sufficiently
common
not
to
excite
astonishment
at
such
a
coincidence
had
george
eliot
really
known
of
this
tale
a
tale
feebly
executed
at
the
best
she
would
obviously
have
altered
the
name
so
as
not
to
make
her
obligation
too
patent
to
the
world
as
it
is
she
was
not
a
little
astonished
and
even
indignant
on
accidentally
seeing
this
opinion
stated
in
some
review
and
positively
denied
ever
having
seen
the
story
in
question
indeed
when
one
knows
how
this
story
grew
out
of
her
own
experience
how
its
earlier
portions
especially
are
a
record
of
her
own
and
her
brother
childhood
how
even
glegg
and
pullet
were
only
too
faithfully
done
from
the
aunts
of
real
life
one
need
not
go
far
afield
to
seek
for
its
origin
every
author
usually
writes
one
book
which
he
might
more
or
less
justly
entitle
confessions
into
which
he
pours
an
intimate
part
of
his
life
under
a
thin
disguise
of
fiction
a
book
invariably
exciting
a
unique
kind
of
interest
in
the
reader
be
he
conscious
or
not
of
the
presence
of
this
autobiographical
element
fielding
thackeray
copperfield
charlotte
brontë
are
cases
in
point
the
on
the
floss
is
a
work
of
similar
nature
maggie
tulliver
is
george
eliot
herself
but
only
one
side
one
portion
one
phase
of
george
eliot
vastly
complex
nature
it
is
george
inner
life
in
childhood
and
youth
as
it
appeared
to
her
own
consciousness
we
recognise
in
it
her
mental
acuteness
her
clinging
affectionateness
her
ambition
her
outlook
beyond
the
present
her
religious
and
moral
preoccupations
even
her
genius
is
not
so
much
omitted
as
left
in
an
undeveloped
rudimentary
state
while
her
stories
her
thirst
for
knowledge
her
spiritual
wrestlings
and
the
passionate
response
of
her
soul
to
high
thinking
noble
music
and
the
beautiful
in
all
its
forms
show
that
the
making
of
genius
was
there
in
germ
much
in
the
same
manner
goethe
was
fond
of
partitioning
his
nature
and
of
giving
only
the
weaker
side
to
his
fictitious
representatives
conscious
in
himself
of
fluctuations
of
purpose
which
he
only
got
the
better
of
by
his
indomitable
will
he
usually
endowed
these
characters
with
his
more
impulsive
pliant
self
as
manifested
in
werther
in
tasso
in
edward
of
the
affinities
in
this
sense
also
maggie
tulliver
resembles
george
eliot
she
is
her
potential
self
such
as
she
might
have
been
had
there
not
been
counterbalancing
tendencies
of
unusual
force
sufficient
to
hold
in
check
all
erratic
impulses
contrary
to
the
main
direction
of
her
life
while
tempted
to
dwell
largely
on
maggie
tulliver
the
central
figure
of
mill
on
the
floss
it
would
be
very
unfair
to
slur
over
the
other
admirably
drawn
characters
of
this
novel
her
brother
tom
already
repeatedly
alluded
to
is
in
every
sense
the
counterpart
of
sister
maggie
hard
and
he
was
from
a
boy
particularly
clear
and
positive
on
one
point
namely
that
he
would
punish
everybody
who
deserved
it
why
he
would
have
minded
being
punished
himself
if
he
deserved
it
but
then
he
never
deserve
it
this
strikes
the
of
a
character
whose
stern
inflexibility
combined
with
much
practical
insight
and
dogged
persistence
of
effort
is
at
the
same
time
dignified
by
a
high
if
somewhat
narrow
sense
of
family
honour
conventional
respectability
in
fact
is
tom
tulliver
religion
he
is
not
in
any
sense
bad
or
mean
or
sordid
he
is
only
so
circumscribed
in
his
perceptive
faculties
that
he
has
no
standard
by
which
to
measure
thoughts
or
feelings
that
transcend
his
own
very
limited
conception
of
life
both
by
his
good
and
his
bad
qualities
by
his
excellencies
and
his
negations
tom
tulliver
proves
himself
what
he
is
a
genuine
sprig
of
the
dodson
family
a
chip
of
the
old
block
and
the
dodson
sisters
are
in
their
way
among
the
most
amazingly
living
portraitures
that
george
eliot
ever
achieved
realism
in
art
can
go
no
further
in
this
direction
these
women
if
present
in
the
flesh
would
not
be
so
distinctively
vivid
as
when
beheld
through
the
transfixing
medium
of
george
genius
for
here
we
have
the
personages
with
all
their
quaintnesses
their
eccentricities
their
odd
twists
and
ways
only
observed
by
fragments
in
actual
life
successfully
brought
to
a
focus
for
the
delight
and
amusement
of
generations
of
readers
there
is
nothing
grotesque
nothing
exaggerated
in
these
humorous
figures
the
comic
effect
is
not
produced
as
is
often
the
case
with
the
inventions
of
dickens
by
some
set
peculiarity
of
manner
or
trick
of
speech
more
in
the
spirit
of
caricature
on
the
contrary
it
is
by
a
strict
adherence
to
the
just
mean
of
nature
by
a
conscientious
care
not
to
overstep
her
probabilities
that
we
owe
these
matchless
types
of
english
provincial
life
and
the
genuine
humour
of
these
types
verges
on
the
pathetic
in
that
the
infinitely
little
of
their
lives
is
so
magnified
by
them
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
real
importance
glegg
with
her
dictatorial
ways
her
small
economies
her
anxiety
to
make
a
handsome
figure
in
her
will
and
her
invariable
reference
to
what
was
the
way
in
our
family
as
a
criterion
of
right
behaviour
on
all
occasions
pullet
the
wife
of
the
bent
on
proving
her
gentility
and
wealth
by
the
delicacy
of
her
health
and
the
quantity
of
doctor
stuff
she
can
afford
to
imbibe
tulliver
the
good
woman
whose
husband
picked
her
from
her
sisters
o
purpose
she
was
a
bit
weak
like
and
for
whom
the
climax
of
misery
in
bankruptcy
is
the
loss
of
her
china
and
these
as
well
as
the
henpecked
glegg
and
the
pullet
are
worthy
pendants
to
poyser
and
dolly
winthrop
whether
too
great
a
predominance
may
not
be
given
to
the
narrow
trivial
views
of
these
people
with
their
prosaic
respectability
is
a
nice
question
which
one
is
inclined
to
answer
in
the
negative
on
reading
such
a
conjugal
scene
as
that
between
and
glegg
after
the
latter
quarrel
with
tulliver
it
was
a
hard
case
that
a
vigorous
mood
for
quarrelling
so
highly
capable
of
using
any
opportunity
should
not
meet
with
a
single
remark
from
glegg
on
which
to
exercise
itself
but
it
appeared
that
his
silence
would
answer
the
purpose
for
he
heard
himself
apostrophised
at
last
in
that
tone
peculiar
to
the
wife
of
one
bosom
glegg
it
a
poor
return
i
get
for
making
you
the
wife
made
you
all
these
years
if
this
is
the
way
i
to
be
treated
better
ha
known
it
before
my
poor
father
died
and
then
when
i
wanted
a
home
i
should
ha
gone
elsewhere
as
the
choice
was
offered
me
glegg
paused
from
his
porridge
and
looked
up
not
with
any
new
amazement
but
simply
with
that
quiet
habitual
wonder
with
which
we
regard
constant
mysteries
what
have
i
done
now
now
glegg
now
i
sorry
for
you
not
seeing
his
way
to
any
pertinent
answer
glegg
reverted
to
his
porridge
husbands
in
the
world
continued
glegg
after
a
pause
have
known
how
to
do
something
different
to
siding
with
everybody
else
against
their
own
wives
perhaps
i
wrong
and
you
can
teach
me
better
but
i
allays
heard
as
it
the
husband
place
to
stand
by
the
wife
instead
of
rejoicing
and
triumphing
when
folks
insult
her
what
call
have
you
to
say
that
said
glegg
rather
warmly
for
though
a
kind
man
he
was
not
as
meek
as
moses
did
i
rejoice
or
triumph
over
you
ways
o
doing
things
worse
than
speaking
out
plain
glegg
i
sooner
you
tell
me
to
my
face
as
you
make
light
of
me
than
try
to
make
as
everybody
in
the
right
but
me
and
come
to
your
breakfast
in
the
morning
as
i
hardly
slept
an
hour
this
night
and
sulk
at
me
as
if
i
was
the
dirt
under
your
feet
at
you
said
glegg
in
a
tone
of
angry
facetiousness
like
a
tipsy
man
as
thinks
everybody
had
too
much
but
himself
lower
yourself
with
using
coarse
language
to
glegg
it
makes
you
look
very
small
though
you
ca
see
yourself
said
glegg
in
a
tone
of
energetic
compassion
man
in
your
place
should
set
an
example
and
talk
more
sensible
after
a
good
deal
of
sparring
in
the
same
tone
glegg
at
last
bursts
forth
ever
anybody
hear
the
like
i
this
parish
a
woman
with
everything
provided
for
her
and
allowed
to
keep
her
own
money
the
same
as
if
it
was
settled
on
her
and
with
a
gig
new
stuffed
and
lined
at
no
end
o
expense
and
provided
for
when
i
die
beyond
anything
she
could
expect
to
go
on
i
this
way
biting
and
snapping
like
a
mad
dog
it
beyond
everything
as
god
should
ha
made
women
these
last
words
were
uttered
in
a
tone
of
sorrowful
agitation
glegg
pushed
his
tea
from
him
and
tapped
the
table
with
both
his
hands
glegg
if
those
are
your
feelings
it
best
they
should
be
known
said
glegg
taking
off
her
napkin
and
folding
it
in
an
excited
manner
if
you
talk
o
my
being
provided
for
beyond
what
i
could
expect
i
beg
leave
to
tell
you
as
i
a
right
to
expect
a
many
things
as
i
do
find
and
as
to
my
being
like
a
mad
dog
it
well
if
you
not
cried
shame
on
by
the
country
for
your
treatment
of
me
for
it
what
i
ca
bear
and
i
wo
here
glegg
voice
intimated
that
she
was
going
to
cry
and
breaking
off
from
speech
she
rang
the
bell
violently
she
said
rising
from
her
chair
and
speaking
in
rather
a
choked
voice
a
fire
upstairs
and
put
the
blinds
down
glegg
you
please
order
what
you
like
for
dinner
i
shall
have
gruel
equally
well
drawn
in
their
way
though
belonging
to
a
different
class
of
character
are
maggie
cousin
the
lovely
gentle
and
refined
lucy
philip
wakem
whose
physical
malformation
is
compensated
by
exceptional
culture
and
nobility
of
nature
tulliver
the
headstrong
violent
but
withal
generous
father
of
maggie
and
his
sister
moss
whose
motherliness
and
carelessness
of
appearances
form
a
striking
foil
to
the
dodson
sisters
indeed
mill
on
the
floss
is
so
rich
in
minor
characters
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
more
than
mention
such
capital
sketches
as
that
of
bob
jakin
and
his
dog
mumps
or
of
luke
the
head
miller
who
has
no
opinion
of
reading
considering
that
there
fools
enoo
an
rogues
enoo
lookin
i
books
for
the
distinguishing
feature
of
this
novel
however
lies
not
so
much
in
its
wealth
of
portraiture
or
freshness
of
humour
as
in
a
certain
passionate
glow
of
youth
which
emanates
from
the
heroine
and
seems
to
warm
the
story
through
and
through
for
passion
pathos
and
poetic
beauty
of
description
mill
on
the
floss
is
certainly
unique
among
george
eliot
works
chapter
silas
marner
the
on
the
floss
which
appeared
in
fully
established
george
eliot
popularity
with
the
public
in
the
same
year
she
published
anonymously
in
a
short
story
called
the
veil
this
tale
is
curious
as
differing
considerably
from
her
general
style
having
a
certain
mystical
turn
which
perhaps
recommended
it
more
especially
to
the
admiration
of
bulwer
lytton
but
indeed
it
attracted
general
attention
in
the
meanwhile
the
relations
between
author
and
publisher
became
more
and
more
friendly
the
critical
acumen
and
sound
judgment
being
highly
esteemed
by
george
eliot
he
judged
well
of
writing
she
remarked
because
he
had
learned
to
judge
well
of
men
and
things
not
merely
through
quickness
of
observation
and
insight
but
with
the
illumination
of
a
heart
in
the
right
place
this
was
the
most
productive
period
of
george
eliot
life
in
three
successive
years
she
published
bede
mill
on
the
floss
and
marner
the
last
story
appearing
in
when
the
amount
of
thought
observation
and
wisdom
concentrated
in
these
novels
is
taken
into
consideration
it
must
be
admitted
that
her
mental
energy
was
truly
astonishing
but
it
was
the
accumulated
experience
of
her
whole
past
the
first
abundant
math
borne
by
the
springtide
of
life
which
was
garnered
up
in
these
three
remarkable
works
afterwards
when
she
came
to
write
her
next
book
she
turned
to
entirely
fresh
fields
of
inspiration
indeed
already
at
this
date
her
mind
was
occupied
with
the
idea
of
an
italian
novel
of
the
time
of
savonarola
in
the
meanwhile
she
produced
her
most
perfect
work
she
wrote
marner
the
weaver
of
raveloe
i
call
marner
her
most
perfect
work
not
only
because
of
the
symmetry
with
which
each
part
is
adjusted
in
relation
to
the
whole
nor
because
of
the
absence
of
those
partly
satirical
partly
moral
reflections
with
which
george
eliot
usually
accompanies
the
action
of
her
stories
but
chiefly
on
account
of
the
simple
pathos
of
the
central
motive
into
which
all
the
different
incidents
and
characters
naturally
converge
how
homely
are
the
elements
from
which
this
work
of
art
is
constructed
and
how
matchless
the
result
nothing
but
the
story
of
a
humble
weaver
belonging
to
a
small
dissenting
community
which
assembled
in
lantern
yard
somewhere
in
the
back
streets
of
a
manufacturing
town
of
a
faithless
love
and
a
false
friend
and
the
loss
of
trust
in
all
things
human
or
divine
nothing
but
the
story
of
a
lone
bewildered
man
shut
out
from
his
kind
concentrating
every
baulked
passion
into
one
the
passion
for
gold
and
then
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
hoard
from
its
accustomed
and
in
its
stead
the
startling
apparition
of
a
little
child
found
one
snowy
winter
night
sleeping
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
glimmering
hearth
and
the
gradual
reawakening
of
love
in
the
heart
of
the
solitary
man
a
love
drawing
his
hope
and
joy
continually
onward
beyond
the
money
and
once
more
bringing
him
into
sympathetic
relations
with
his
in
old
days
says
the
story
there
were
angels
who
came
and
took
men
by
the
hand
and
led
them
away
from
the
city
of
destruction
we
see
no
angels
now
but
yet
men
are
led
away
from
threatening
destruction
a
hand
is
put
into
theirs
which
leads
them
forth
gently
towards
a
calm
and
bright
land
so
that
they
look
no
more
backward
and
the
hand
may
be
a
little
child
curiously
enough
i
came
quite
recently
upon
a
story
which
in
its
leading
features
very
closely
resembles
this
tale
of
the
of
raveloe
it
is
called
the
potter
and
is
considered
the
masterpiece
of
kraszewski
the
polish
novelist
author
of
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
works
in
different
branches
of
literature
the
most
popular
of
them
all
has
been
translated
into
french
dutch
and
german
it
gives
an
extraordinarily
vivid
picture
of
peasant
life
in
a
remote
polish
village
and
not
only
of
peasant
life
but
of
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
landed
proprietor
the
jew
the
artisan
and
the
yeoman
in
a
community
whose
modes
of
life
have
undergone
but
little
modification
since
the
middle
ages
these
pictures
though
not
elaborated
with
anything
like
the
minute
care
of
george
eliot
descriptions
of
english
country
life
yet
from
their
extreme
simplicity
produce
a
most
powerful
impression
on
the
reader
the
story
in
brief
is
that
of
jermola
the
body
servant
of
a
polish
nobleman
in
volhynia
whom
he
has
served
with
rare
devotion
during
the
greater
part
of
his
life
left
almost
a
beggar
at
his
master
death
without
a
single
human
tie
all
he
can
get
for
years
of
faithful
service
is
a
forsaken
old
inn
where
he
manages
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
in
a
dismantled
room
that
but
partly
shelters
him
from
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
hopeless
aimless
loveless
he
grows
old
before
his
time
and
the
passing
of
the
days
affects
him
hardly
more
than
it
does
a
stone
but
one
evening
as
he
is
sitting
in
front
of
a
scanty
fire
repeating
the
lord
prayer
the
cry
as
of
a
little
child
startles
him
from
his
devotion
going
to
look
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
such
unusual
sounds
he
soon
discovers
an
infant
in
linen
wailing
under
an
old
oak
tree
he
takes
the
foundling
home
and
from
that
moment
a
new
life
enters
the
old
man
breast
he
is
rejuvenated
by
twenty
years
he
is
kept
in
a
constant
flutter
of
hope
fear
and
activity
a
woman
called
the
kozaczicha
tenders
him
her
services
but
he
is
so
jealous
of
any
one
but
himself
doing
aught
for
the
child
that
he
checks
her
advances
and
by
hook
or
by
crook
obtains
a
goat
from
an
extortionate
jew
by
the
help
of
which
he
rears
the
boy
satisfactorily
then
wishing
to
make
a
livelihood
for
the
child
sake
he
inclines
at
first
to
the
craft
of
the
weaver
but
finally
turns
potter
in
his
old
age
love
sharpening
his
wits
he
plies
quite
a
thriving
trade
in
time
and
the
beautiful
boy
brings
him
into
more
friendly
relations
with
his
neighbours
but
one
day
when
radionek
who
has
learned
jermola
trade
is
about
twelve
years

at

in

for
he
clings

only
grudgingly
allowed
to

the

pines
however
for
the
dear
familiar
presence
of
his
and
the
free
outdoor
life
and
at
last
after
some
years
of
misery
he
appears
one
day
suddenly
in
jermola
hut
who
has
given
up
his
pottery
in
order
to
be
secretly
near
the

he
is
afraid
to
go
and
see
the
piteous
entreaties
of
radionek
and
the
sight
of
his
now
sickly
countenance
induce
the
old
man
to
flee
into

pathless
forests
where
the
two
may
escape
unseen
and
reach
some
distant
part
of
the
country
to
take
up
their
old
pleasant
life
once
more
but
the
hardships
and
fatigues
of
the
journey
are
too
much
for
the
boy
enfeebled
health
and
just
as
they
come
within
sight
of
human
dwellings
he
is
seized
with
a
fever
which
cuts
his
young
life
short
leaving
jermola
nearly
crazy
with
anguish
long
afterwards
a
little
decrepit
old
man
was
to
be
seen
by
churchgoers
sitting
near
a
grave
whom
the
children
mocked
by
calling
the
bony
little
man
because
he
seemed
to
consist
of
nothing
but
bones
such
is
the
bare
outline
of
a
story
whose
main
idea
that
of
the
redemption
of
a
human
soul
from
cold
petrifying
isolation
by
means
of
a
little
child
is
unquestionably
the
same
as
in
marner
other
incidents
such
as
that
of
the
peasant
woman
who
initiates
jermola
into
the
mysteries
of
baby
management
and
the
disclosure
of
the
real
parents
after
a
lapse
of
years
wanting
to
have
their
child
back
suggest
parallel
passages
in
the
english
book
but
coincidences
of
this
kind
are
after
all
natural
enough
considering
that
the
circle
of
human
feeling
and
action
is
limited
and
that
in
all
ages
and
countries
like
conditions
must
give
rise
to
much
the
same
sequence
of
events
it
is
therefore
most
likely
that
george
eliot
never
saw
and
possibly
never
even
heard
of
the
potter
the
monotonous
tone
in
the
narrative
of
this
polish
novel
is
in
strong
contrast
it
may
be
observed
to
george
eliot
vivid
and
varied
treatment
of
her
subject
this
monotony
however
suits
the
local
colouring
of
by
suggesting
the
idea
of
the
expanse
of
ancient
forests
whose
sombre
solitudes
encompass
with
a
mysterious
awe
the
little
temporary
dwellings
of
men
but
if
the
foreign
story
surpasses
marner
in
tragic
pathos
the
latter
far
excels
it
in
the
masterly
handling
of
character
and
dialogue
in
the
underlying
breadth
of
thought
and
above
all
in
the
precious
salt
of
its
humour
indeed
for
humour
for
sheer
force
for
intense
realism
george
eliot
in
the
immortal
scene
at
the
rainbow
may
be
said
to
rival
shakespeare
her
farriers
her
butchers
her
wheelwrights
her
tailors
have
the
same
startling
vitality
the
same
unmistakable
accents
of
nature
the
same
distinctive
yet
unforced
individuality
free
from
either
exaggeration
or
caricature
how
delicious
is
the
description
of
the
party
assembled
in
the
kitchen
of
that
inn
whose
landlord
a
strong
advocate
for
compromising
whatever
differences
of
opinion
may
arise
between
his
customers
as
beings
all
alike
in
need
of
liquor
clinches
all
arguments
by
his
favourite
phrase
you
both
right
and
both
wrong
as
i
say
how
admirably
comic
are
these
villagers
invariably
beginning
their
nightly
sittings
by
a
solemn
silence
in
which
one
and
all
puff
away
at
their
pipes
staring
at
the
fire
as
if
a
bet
were
depending
on
the
first
man
who
winked
and
when
they
begin
at
last
how
rich
is
the
flavour
of
that
talk
given
with
an
unerring
precision
that
forthwith
makes
one
acquainted
with
the
crass
ignorance
and
shrewdness
the
and
superstition
so
oddly
jumbled
together
in
the
villager
mind
what
sublime
absence
of
all
knowledge
of
his
native
land
is
shown
by
the
veteran
parish
clerk
macey
in
speaking
of
a
person
from
another
county
which
apparently
could
not
be
so
very
different
from
this
country
for
he
brought
a
fine
breed
sheep
with
him
so
there
must
be
pastures
there
and
everything
reasonable
yet
the
same
man
can
put
down
youthful
presumption
pretty
sharply
as
when
he
remarks
there
allays
two
there
the
a
man
has
o
himsen
and
there
the
other
folks
have
on
him
there
be
two
about
a
cracked
bell
if
the
bell
could
hear
itself
dolly
winthrop
the
wife
of
the
jolly
wheelwright
who
makes
one
of
the
company
at
the
rainbow
is
no
less
admirable
she
is
not
cut
after
any
particular
pattern
or
type
of
human
nature
but
has
a
distinctive
individuality
and
is
full
of
a
freshness
and
unexpectedness
which
sets
foregone
conclusions
at
defiance
a
notable
woman
with
a
boundless
appetite
for
work
so
that
rising
at
four
she
has
a
bit
time
to
spare
most
days
for
when
one
gets
up
betimes
i
the
morning
the
clock
seems
to
stan
still
ten
afore
it
time
to
go
about
the
victual
yet
with
all
this
energy
she
is
not
shrewish
but
a
calm
grave
woman
in
much
request
in
sick
rooms
or
wherever
there
is
trouble
she
is
too
and
of
a
comfortable
temper
being
patiently
tolerant
of
her
husband
jokes
considering
that
would
be
so
and
viewing
the
stronger
sex
in
the
light
of
animals
whom
it
pleased
heaven
to
make
troublesome
like
bulls
or
turkey
cocks
her
vague
idea
shared
indeed
by
silas
that
he
has
quite
another
faith
from
herself
as
coming
from
another
part
of
the
country
gives
a
vivid
idea
of
remote
rural
life
as
well
as
her
own
dim
but
thoroughly
reverential
religious
feelings
prompting
her
always
to
speak
of
the
divinity
in
the
plural
as
when
she
says
to
marner
i
looked
for
help
in
the
right
quarter
and
give
myself
up
to
them
as
we
must
all
give
ourselves
up
to
at
the
last
and
if
done
our
part
it
is
to
be
believed
as
them
as
are
above
us
be
worse
nor
we
are
and
come
short
o
theirn
the
humour
shown
in
these
scenes
and
characters
or
more
properly
speaking
george
eliot
humour
in
general
belongs
to
the
highest
order
the
same
as
shakespeare
it
is
based
on
the
essential
elements
of
human
nature
itself
on
the
pathetic
incongruities
of
which
that
quintessence
of
dust
man
is
made
up
instead
of
finding
the
comic
in
the
purely
accidental
or
external
circumstances
of
life
as
is
the
case
with
such
humourists
as
rabelais
and
dickens
these
latter
might
find
a
good
subject
for
their
comic
vein
in
seeing
the
venus
of
milo
broken
nose
which
a
mischievous
urchin
had
again
stuck
on
the
wrong
side
upwards
a
sight
to
send
the
ordinary
spectator
into
fits
of
laughter
but
the
genuine
humourist
sees
something
in
that
feature
itself
as
nature
shaped
it
to
excite
his
facetiousness
in
minor
prophet
some
lines
occur
in
which
a
somewhat
similar
view
of
the
genuine
source
of
humour
is
pithily
put
my
yearnings
fail
to
reach
that
high
apocalyptic
mount
which
shows
in
view
a
perfect
world
or
enter
warmly
into
other
joys
than
those
of
faulty
struggling
human
kind
that
strain
upon
my
soul
too
feeble
wing
ends
in
ignoble
floundering
i
fall
into
pity
for
the
men
who
living
in
those
perfect
future
times
will
not
know
half
the
dear
imperfect
things
that
move
my
smiles
and
tears
will
never
know
the
fine
old
incongruities
that
raise
my
friendly
laugh
the
innocent
conceits
that
like
a
needless
eyeglass
or
black
patch
give
those
who
wear
them
harmless
happiness
the
twists
and
cracks
in
our
poor
earthenware
that
touch
me
to
more
conscious
fellowship
i
am
not
myself
the
finest
parian
with
my
coevals
again
in
her
essay
on
heine
george
eliot
thus
defines
the
difference
between
humour
and
wit
humour
is
of
earlier
growth
than
wit
and
it
is
in
accordance
with
this
earlier
growth
that
it
has
more
affinity
with
the
poetic
tendencies
while
wit
is
more
nearly
allied
to
the
ratiocinative
intellect
humour
draws
its
materials
from
situations
and
characteristics
wit
seizes
on
unexpected
and
complex
relations
it
is
only
the
ingenuity
condensation
and
instantaneousness
which
lift
some
witticisms
from
reasoning
into
wit
they
are
reasoning
raised
to
its
highest
power
on
the
other
hand
humour
in
its
higher
forms
and
in
proportion
as
it
associates
itself
with
the
sympathetic
emotions
continually
passes
into
poetry
nearly
all
great
modern
humorists
may
be
called
prose
poets
the
quality
which
distinguishes
george
eliot
humour
may
be
said
to
characterise
her
treatment
of
human
nature
generally
in
her
delineations
of
life
she
carefully
eschews
the
anomalous
or
exceptional
pointing
out
repeatedly
that
she
would
not
if
she
could
be
the
writer
however
brilliant
who
dwells
by
preference
on
the
moral
or
intellectual
attributes
which
mark
off
his
hero
from
the
crowd
instead
of
on
those
which
he
has
in
common
with
average
humanity
nowhere
perhaps
in
her
works
do
we
find
this
tendency
so
strikingly
illustrated
as
in
the
one
now
under
consideration
for
here
we
have
the
study
of
a
human
being
who
by
stress
of
circumstances
developes
into
a
most
abnormal
specimen
of
mankind
yet
who
is
brought
back
to
normal
conditions
and
to
wholesome
relations
with
his
by
such
a
natural
process
as
the
of
benumbed
sympathies
through
his
love
for
the
little
foundling
child
the
scene
where
he
finds
that
child
has
only
been
touched
on
in
a
passing
allusion
yet
there
is
no
more
situation
in
any
of
her
novels
than
that
where
silas
with
the
child
in
his
arms
goes
out
into
the
dark
night
and
guided
by
the
little
footprints
in
the
virgin
snow
discovers
the
dead
mother
godfrey
wife
lying
with
her
head
sunk
low
in
the
furze
and
half
covered
with
the
shaken
snow
there
is
a
picture
of
this
subject
by
the
young
and
singularly
gifted
artist
the
late
oliver
madox
brown
more
generally
known
as
a
novelist
which
is
one
of
the
few
pictorial
interpretations
that
seem
to
completely
project
on
the
canvas
a
visible
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
the
original
the
pale
emaciated
weaver
staring
with
big
eyes
at
the
body
of
the
unconscious
young
woman
stretched
on
the
ground
clutching
the
lusty
struggling
child
with
one
arm
while
with
the
other
he
holds
a
lantern
which
throws
a
feeble
gleam
on
the
snow
is
realised
with
exceptional
intensity
the
exquisite
picture
of
eppie
childhood
the
dance
she
leads
her
are
things
to
read
not
to
describe
unless
one
could
quote
whole
pages
of
this
delightful
idyl
which
for
gracious
charm
and
limpid
purity
of
description
recalls
those
pearls
among
george
sand
le
champi
and
mare
au
diable
chapter
xi
romola
marks
a
new
departure
in
george
eliot
literary
career
from
the
present
she
turned
to
the
past
from
the
native
to
the
foreign
from
the
domestic
to
the
historical
yet
in
thus
shifting
her
she
did
not
alter
the
tendencies
underlying
her
earlier
novels
there
was
more
of
spontaneous
humorous
description
of
life
in
the
latter
whereas
in
the
ethical
teaching
which
forms
so
prominent
a
feature
of
george
eliot
art
though
the
same
in
essence
was
more
distinctly
wrought
out
touching
on
this
very
point
she
observes
in
a
letter
to
an
american
correspondent
it
is
perhaps
less
irrelevant
to
say
apropos
of
a
distinction
you
seem
to
make
between
my
earlier
and
later
works
that
though
i
trust
there
is
some
growth
in
my
appreciation
of
others
and
in
my
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
point
of
view
from
which
i
regard
our
life
since
i
wrote
my
first
fiction
the
of
clerical
life
any
apparent
change
of
spirit
must
be
due
to
something
of
which
i
am
unconscious
the
principles
which
are
at
the
root
of
my
effort
to
paint
dinah
morris
are
equally
at
the
root
of
my
effort
to
paint
mordecai
the
first
section
of
appeared
in
the
for
the
summer
of
and
running
its
course
in
that
popular
periodical
was
finished
in
the
summer
of
the
following
year
lewes
in
a
letter
written
from
blandford
square
july
to
some
old
friends
of
george
eliot
makes
the
following
remarks
in
reference
to
this
new
form
of
publication
my
main
object
in
persuading
her
to
consent
to
serial
publication
was
not
the
magnificence
of
the
offer
but
the
advantage
to
such
a
work
of
being
read
slowly
and
deliberately
instead
of
being
galloped
through
in
three
volumes
i
think
it
quite
unique
and
so
will
the
public
when
it
gets
over
the
first
feeling
of
surprise
and
disappointment
at
the
book
not
being
english
and
like
its
predecessor
and
some
time
afterwards
he
wrote
to
the
same
friends
marian
lives
entirely
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
is
much
cheered
every
now
and
then
by
hearing
indirectly
how
her
book
is
appreciated
by
the
higher
class
of
minds
and
some
of
the
highest
though
it
is
not
and
can
not
be
popular
in
florence
we
hear
they
are
wild
with
delight
and
surprise
at
such
a
work
being
executed
by
a
foreigner
as
if
an
italian
had
ever
done
anything
of
the
kind
before
writing
george
eliot
had
spent
six
weeks
in
florence
in
order
to
familiarise
herself
with
the
manners
and
conversation
of
its
inhabitants
and
yet
she
hardly
caught
the
trick
of
italian
speech
and
for
some
time
afterwards
she
hung
back
from
beginning
her
story
as
her
characters
not
only
refused
to
speak
italian
to
her
but
would
not
speak
at
all
as
we
can
well
imagine
poyser
bartle
massey
and
maggie
to
have
done
these
recalcitrant
spirits
were
at
last
brought
to
order
and
she
succeeded
so
well
especially
in
her
delineation
of
the
lower
classes
that
they
have
been
recognised
by
italians
as
true
to
the
life
it
should
however
be
mentioned
that
the
greatest
modern
italian
giuseppe
mazzini
found
fault
with
the
handling
and
indeed
with
the
introduction
into
this
novel
of
the
great
figure
of
savonarola
he
considered
that
it
compared
unfavourably
with
bede
a
novel
he
genuinely
admired
all
but
the
marriage
of
adam
with
dinah
morris
which
he
said
shocked
his
feelings
not
having
any
conception
that
the
taste
of
the
public
demands
a
happy
ending
whatever
may
have
been
the
previous
course
of
the
three
volumes
another
illustrious
man
rossetti
whose
judgment
on
such
a
subject
carries
peculiar
weight
considered
george
eliot
to
have
been
much
less
successful
in
than
in
her
novels
of
english
country
life
he
did
not
think
that
the
tone
and
colour
of
italian
life
in
the
fifteenth
century
were
caught
with
that
intuitive
perception
of
a
bygone
age
characteristic
of
a
walter
scott
or
a
meinhold
the
florentine
contemporaries
of
fra
girolamo
seemed
to
him
nineteenth
century
men
and
women
dressed
up
in
the
costume
of
the
fifteenth
the
book
to
use
his
expression
was
not
native
it
is
a
majestic
book
however
the
most
grandly
planned
of
george
eliot
novels
it
has
a
certain
architectural
dignity
of
structure
quite
in
keeping
with
its
italian
nationality
a
quality
by
the
way
entirely
absent
from
the
three
later
novels
the
impressive
historical
background
is
not
unlike
one
of
irving
magnificently
wrought
italian
rich
in
movement
and
colour
yet
helping
to
throw
the
chief
figures
into
greater
relief
the
erudition
shown
in
this
work
the
vast
yet
minute
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
thought
the
manners
the
very
talk
of
the
florentines
of
that
day
are
truly
surprising
but
perhaps
the
very
fact
of
that
erudition
being
so
perceptible
shows
that
the
material
has
not
been
absolutely
vitalised
the
amount
of
labour
george
eliot
expended
on
was
so
great
that
it
was
the
book
which
she
remarked
to
a
friend
she
began
a
young
woman
and
ended
an
old
one
the
deep
impression
her
works
had
made
upon
the
public
mind
heightened
her
natural
conscientiousness
and
her
gratitude
for
the
confidence
with
which
each
fresh
contribution
from
her
pen
was
received
increased
her
anxiety
to
wield
her
influence
for
the
highest
ends
but
her
gratitude
to
the
public
by
no
means
extended
to
the
critics
she
recoiled
from
them
with
the
instinctive
shrinking
of
the
sensitive
plant
these
interpreters
between
author
and
public
were
in
her
eyes
a
most
superfluous
modern
institution
though
at
one
time
she
herself
had
not
scorned
to
sit
in
the
critic
seat
it
is
that
lewes
acted
as
a
kind
of
moral
screen
protecting
her
from
every
gust
or
breath
of
criticism
that
was
not
entirely
genial
one
lady
after
reading
mill
on
the
floss
had
written
off
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
and
with
the
freedom
of
old
friendship
while
expressing
the
warmest
admiration
for
the
beauty
of
the
first
two
volumes
she
had
ventured
to
find
fault
with
part
of
the
third
this
letter
was
returned
by
lewes
who
begged
her
at
the
same
time
never
to
write
again
in
this
strain
to
george
eliot
to
whom
he
had
not
ventured
to
show
it
for
fear
it
should
too
painfully
affect
her
in
a
letter
to
the
american
lady
already
mentioned
george
eliot
after
referring
to
this
habit
of
lewes
says
in
this
way
i
get
confirmed
in
my
impression
that
the
criticism
of
any
new
writing
is
shifting
and
untrustworthy
i
hardly
think
that
any
critic
can
have
so
keen
a
sense
of
the
shortcomings
in
my
works
as
that
i
groan
under
in
the
course
of
writing
them
and
i
can
not
imagine
any
edification
coming
to
an
author
from
a
sort
of
reviewing
which
consists
in
attributing
to
him
or
her
unexpressed
opinions
and
in
imagining
circumstances
which
may
be
alleged
as
petty
private
motives
for
the
treatment
of
subjects
which
ought
to
be
of
general
human
interest
i
have
been
led
into
this
rather
superfluous
sort
of
remark
by
the
mention
of
a
rule
which
seemed
to
require
explanation
and
again
on
another
occasion
to
the
same
effect
but
do
not
expect
criticism
from
me
i
hate
in
the
seat
of
judgment
and
i
would
rather
impress
the
public
generally
with
the
sense
that
they
may
get
the
best
result
from
a
book
without
necessarily
forming
an
about
it
than
i
would
rush
into
stating
opinions
of
my
own
the
floods
of
nonsense
printed
in
the
form
of
critical
opinions
seem
to
me
a
chief
curse
of
our
times
a
chief
obstacle
to
true
culture
in
spite
of
these
severe
strictures
on
the
critics
and
their
opinions
an
opinion
must
now
be
given
about
this
novel
may
really
be
judged
from
two
entirely
different
points
of
view
possibly
from
others
besides
but
as
it
appears
to
me
from
two
one
may
consider
it
as
an
historical
work
with
its
moving
pageants
its
civic
broils
its
church
festivals
its
religious
revival
its
fickle
populace
now
siding
with
the
pope
and
now
with
the
reformer
of
the
papacy
or
again
one
may
regard
the
conjugal
relations
between
romola
and
tito
the
slow
spiritual
growth
of
the
one
and
the
swifter
moral
disintegration
of
the
other
as
one
of
the
subtlest
studies
in
psychology
in
literature
to
turn
to
the
scenic
details
which
form
a
considerable
element
of
this
historical
picture
i
have
already
hinted
that
they
are
not
without
a
taint
of
cumbrousness
and
pedantry
the
author
seems
to
move
somewhat
heavily
under
her
weight
of
learning
and
we
miss
that
splendid
natural
swiftness
and
ease
of
movement
which
shakespeare
goethe
and
hugo
know
how
to
impart
to
their
crowds
and
spectacular
effects
if
instead
of
the
people
one
examines
the
man
who
dominated
the
people
the
large
massive
imposing
figure
of
savonarola
one
must
admit
that
the
character
is
very
powerfully
and
faithfully
executed
but
not
produced
at
one
throw
he
does
not
take
the
imagination
by
storm
as
he
would
have
done
had
carlyle
been
at
his
fashioning
with
an
epithet
or
two
with
a
sharp
incisive
phrase
the
latter
would
have
conjured
the
great
dominican
from
his
grave
and
we
should
have
seen
him
or
believed
at
least
that
we
saw
him
as
he
was
in
the
flesh
when
his
impassioned
voice
resounded
through
the
duomo
swaying
the
hearts
of
the
florentine
people
with
the
force
of
a
great
conviction
that
he
stands
out
thus
tangibly
in
it
would
be
futile
to
assert
nevertheless
he
is
a
noble
powerful
study
although
one
has
laboriously
to
gather
into
one
mind
the
somewhat
mechanical
descriptions
which
help
to
portray
his
individuality
the
idea
underlying
the
working
out
of
this
grand
character
is
the
same
which
goethe
had
once
proposed
to
himself
in
his
projected
but
unfortunately
never
executed
drama
of
it
is
that
of
a
man
of
moral
genius
who
in
solitude
and
obscurity
has
conceived
some
new
profounder
aspect
of
religious
truth
and
who
stirred
by
a
sublime
devotion
now
goes
forth
among
men
to
bless
and
regenerate
them
by
teaching
them
this
higher
life
but
in
his
contact
with
the
multitude
in
his
efforts
at
influencing
it
the
prophet
or
preacher
is
in
his
turn
influenced
if
he
fails
to
move
by
the
loftiest
means
he
will
gradually
resort
to
the
lower
in
order
to
effect
his
purpose
the
purity
of
his
spirit
is
tarnished
ambition
has
crept
in
where
holiness
reigned
and
his
perfect
rectitude
of
purpose
will
be
sacrificed
so
that
he
may
but
rule
such
are
the
opposing
tendencies
in
savonarola
mixed
but
lofty
nature
for
that
dissidence
between
inward
reality
and
outward
seeming
was
not
the
christian
simplicity
after
which
he
had
striven
through
years
of
his
youth
and
prime
and
which
he
had
preached
as
a
chief
fruit
of
the
divine
life
in
the
heat
and
stress
of
the
day
with
cheeks
burning
with
shouts
ringing
in
the
ears
who
is
so
blest
as
to
remember
the
yearnings
he
had
in
the
cool
and
silent
morning
and
know
that
he
has
not
belied
them
and
again
it
was
the
habit
of
savonarola
mind
to
conceive
great
things
and
to
feel
that
he
was
the
man
to
do
them
iniquity
should
be
brought
low
the
cause
of
justice
purity
and
love
should
triumph
and
it
should
triumph
by
his
voice
by
his
work
by
his
blood
in
moments
of
ecstatic
contemplation
doubtless
the
sense
of
self
melted
in
the
sense
of
the
unspeakable
and
in
that
part
of
his
experience
lay
the
elements
of
genuine
but
in
the
presence
of
his
for
whom
he
was
to
act
seemed
a
necessary
condition
of
life
but
as
george
eliot
says
power
rose
against
him
not
because
of
his
sins
but
because
of
his
greatness
not
because
he
sought
to
deceive
the
world
but
because
he
sought
to
make
it
noble
and
through
that
greatness
of
his
he
endured
a
double
agony
not
only
the
reviling
and
the
torture
and
the
but
the
agony
of
sinking
from
the
vision
of
glorious
achievement
into
that
deep
shadow
where
he
could
only
say
count
as
nothing
darkness
encompasses
me
yet
the
light
i
saw
was
the
true
light
but
after
all
in
george
eliot
story
the
chief
interest
attaching
to
fra
girolamo
consists
in
his
influence
on
romola
spiritual
growth
this
may
possibly
be
a
blemish
yet
in
most
novels
the
fictitious
characters
eclipse
the
historical
ones
the
effect
produced
by
the
romola
is
not
unlike
that
of
an
antique
statue
at
once
splendidly
beautiful
and
imposingly
cold
by
the
side
of
tito
she
reminds
one
of
the
pure
whiteness
of
marble
sculpture
as
contrasted
with
the
rich
glowing
sensuousness
of
a
venetian
picture
it
is
difficult
to
analyse
why
the
proud
loving
romola
who
has
something
of
the
fierceness
and
impetuosity
of
the
old
bardo
blood
in
her
should
leave
this
impression
of
coldness
for
in
spite
of
her
acts
of
magnanimity
and
such
curiously
enough
is
the
case
perhaps
in
this
instance
george
eliot
modelled
the
character
too
much
according
to
a
philosophical
conception
instead
of
projecting
it
complete
in
its
incompleteness
as
it
might
have
come
from
the
hand
of
nature
another
objection
sometimes
brought
forward
of
romola
having
but
little
resemblance
to
an
italian
woman
of
the
fifteenth
century
seems
to
me
less
relevant
the
lofty
dignity
the
pride
the
intense
adhesion
to
family
traditions
were
on
the
contrary
very
marked
attributes
of
a
high
national
type
during
the
period
of
italian
supremacy
in
fact
the
character
is
not
without
hints
and
suggestions
of
such
a
woman
as
vittoria
colonna
while
its
didactic
tendency
slightly
recalls
those
awful
women
of
italy
who
held
professorial
chairs
and
were
great
in
civil
and
canon
law
in
one
sense
romola
is
a
true
child
of
the
renaissance
brought
up
by
her
father
the
enthusiastic
old
scholar
in
pagan
ideas
she
had
remained
aloof
from
roman
catholic
beliefs
and
superstitions
and
even
when
transformed
by
the
mighty
influence
of
savonarola
into
a
devoted
her
attitude
always
remains
more
or
less
that
of
a
protestant
unwilling
to
surrender
the
right
of
private
judgment
to
the
church
the
clash
of
character
when
a
woman
like
romola
finds
herself
chained
in
a
bond
to
such
a
nature
as
tito
the
beautiful
wily
insinuating
greek
is
wrought
out
with
wonderful
skill
and
matchless
subtlety
of
analysis
indeed
tito
is
not
only
one
of
george
eliot
most
original
creations
he
is
a
unique
character
in
fiction
novelists
as
a
rule
only
depict
the
villain
or
traitor
their
virtuous
and
wicked
people
being
separated
from
each
other
by
a
hard
and
fast
line
much
like
the
goats
and
sheep
they
continually
treat
character
as
something
permanent
and
unchangeable
whereas
to
george
eliot
it
presents
itself
as
an
organism
flexible
by
nature
subject
to
change
under
varying
conditions
liable
on
the
one
hand
to
disease
and
deterioration
but
on
the
other
hand
no
less
capable
of
being
rehabilitated
refined
or
ennobled
this
is
one
of
the
most
distinctive
notes
of
george
eliot
art
and
gives
a
quickening
fructifying
quality
to
her
moral
teaching
but
it
is
an
artistic
no
less
than
a
moral
gain
sharpening
the
interest
felt
in
the
evolution
of
her
fictitious
personages
for
this
reason
tito
the
creature
of
circumstances
is
perhaps
the
most
striking
of
all
her
characters
in
the
eyes
of
the
psychologist
we
seem
to
see
the
very
pulse
of
the
human
machine
laid
bare
to
see
the
corroding
effect
of
and
dread
of
pain
on
a
nature
not
intrinsically
wicked
to
see
at
last
how
little
by
little
weakness
has
led
to
falsehood
and
falsehood
to
infamy
and
yet
this
creature
who
under
our
eyes
gradually
hardens
into
crime
is
one
so
richly
dowered
with
rare
gifts
of
person
and
mind
that
in
spite
of
his
moral
degeneracy
he
fascinates
the
reader
no
less
than
the
men
and
women
supposed
to
come
into
actual
contact
with
him
his
beauty
is
described
with
the
same
intensity
as
hetty
the
warm
glow
of
colour
in
his
face
with
its
dark
curls
and
long
eyes
his
sunny
brightness
of
look
the
velvet
softness
of
a
manner
with
which
he
ingratiates
himself
with
young
and
old
and
the
airy
buoyancy
of
his
whole
gracious
being
are
as
vividly
portrayed
as
the
quick
talent
to
which
everything
comes
natural
the
abundant
the
acuteness
of
a
polished
intellect
whose
sharp
edge
will
at
need
cut
relentlessly
through
every
tissue
of
sentiment
from
melema
first
uneasy
debate
with
himself
when
in
his
splendid
unsoiled
youth
he
enters
florence
a
shipwrecked
stranger
a
debate
that
is
as
to
whether
he
is
bound
to
go
in
search
of
baldassare
who
has
been
as
a
father
to
him
to
the
moment
when
his
already
blunted
conscience
absolves
him
from
such
a
search
and
again
on
to
that
supreme
crisis
when
suddenly
face
to
face
with
his
benefactor
he
denies
him
and
so
is
inevitably
urged
from
one
act
of
baseness
and
cruelty
to
another
still
blacker
we
have
unfolded
before
us
by
an
unshrinking
analyzer
of
human
nature
what
might
not
inappropriately
be
called
a
soul
tragedy
the
wonderful
art
in
the
working
out
of
this
character
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
one
has
no
positive
impression
of
tito
innate
badness
but
on
the
contrary
feels
as
if
after
his
first
lapses
from
truth
and
goodness
there
is
still
a
possibility
of
his
reforming
if
only
his
soft
nature
were
not
driven
on
almost
in
spite
of
himself
by
his
shuddering
dread
of
shame
or
suffering
in
any
form
for
writes
george
eliot
tito
was
experiencing
that
inexorable
law
of
human
souls
that
we
prepare
ourselves
for
sudden
deeds
by
the
reiterated
choice
of
good
or
evil
which
gradually
determines
character
the
description
of
the
married
life
of
romola
and
tito
is
unsurpassed
in
george
eliot
novels
for
subtlety
and
depth
of
insight
notably
the
young
wife
fond
striving
after
complete
inner
harmony
her
first
faint
unavowed
sense
of
something
wanting
her
instinctive
efforts
to
keep
fast
hold
of
her
love
and
trust
and
her
violent
irrevocable
recoil
on
the
discovery
of
tito
first
faithless
action
perhaps
there
is
something
cold
almost
stern
in
romola
loathing
alienation
from
her
husband
and
the
instantaneous
death
of
her
passionate
love
one
can
not
quite
hinder
the
impression
that
a
softer
woman
might
have
forgiven
and
won
from
him
a
confession
of
his
a
confession
which
would
have
averted
the
committal
of
his
worst
and
basest
deeds
indeed
it
is
tito
awe
of
his
grand
noble
wife
and
his
dread
of
her
judgment
which
first
of
all
incite
him
to
prevarication
and
lies
it
is
curious
to
compare
george
sand
theory
of
love
in
this
instance
with
george
eliot
in
leoni
and
in
many
of
her
novels
besides
the
frenchwoman
seems
to
imply
that
for
a
woman
to
love
once
is
to
love
always
and
that
there
is
nothing
so
base
or
mean
or
cruel
but
she
will
forgive
the
man
on
whom
she
has
placed
her
affections
in
the
story
mentioned
above
she
has
worked
out
this
idea
to
an
extent
which
in
many
of
its
details
is
simply
revolting
love
is
there
described
as
a
magnetic
attraction
unresisted
and
irresistible
to
which
the
heroine
absolutely
surrenders
pride
reason
and
conscience
just
the
opposite
kind
of
love
is
that
which
we
find
portrayed
in
it
is
a
love
identical
with
the
fullest
belief
in
the
truth
and
goodness
of
the
beloved
object
so
that
at
the
first
realisation
of
moral
obliquity
the
repulsion
created
extinguishes
that
love
although
there
is
no
outward
severance
of
the
marriage
bond
this
great
novel
closes
with
these
significant
words
which
romola
addresses
to
lillo
tito
child
but
not
her
own
and
so
my
lillo
if
you
mean
to
act
nobly
and
seek
to
know
the
best
things
god
has
put
within
reach
of
man
you
must
learn
to
fix
your
mind
on
that
end
and
not
on
what
will
happen
to
you
because
of
it
and
remember
if
you
were
to
choose
something
lower
and
make
it
the
rule
of
your
life
to
seek
your
own
pleasure
and
escape
from
what
is
disagreeable
calamity
might
come
just
the
same
and
it
would
be
calamity
falling
on
a
base
mind
which
is
the
one
form
of
sorrow
that
has
no
balm
in
it
and
that
may
well
make
a
man
say
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
i
had
never
been
born

george
eliot
life
the
publication
of
her
successive
works
forms
the
chief
landmarks
but
the
year
is
distinguished
by
circumstances
of
some
importance
in
this
year
lewes
after
assisting
to
found
the
assumed
its
editorship
and
among
the
contributions
to
the
first
number
of
the
new
review
was
a
short
article
from
the
pen
of
george
eliot
on
lecky
important
work
influence
of
rationalism
in
the
course
of
the
same
year
and
lewes
moved
from
blandford
square
to
the
priory
a
commodious
house
in
north
bank
john
wood
which
has
come
to
be
intimately
associated
with
the
memory
of
george
eliot
here
in
the
pleasant
decorated
by
owen
jones
might
be
met
at
her
sunday
afternoon
receptions
some
of
the
most
eminent
men
in
literature
art
and
science
for
the
rest
her
life
flowed
on
its
even
tenor
its
routine
being
rigidly
regulated
the
morning
till
lunch
time
was
invariably
devoted
to
writing
in
the
afternoon
she
either
went
out
for
a
quiet
drive
of
about
two
hours
or
she
took
a
walk
with
lewes
in
regent
park
there
the
couple
she
with
a
certain
weird
sibylline
air
he
not
unlike
some
unkempt
polish
refugee
of
vivacious
manners
might
be
seen
swinging
their
arms
as
they
hurried
along
at
a
pace
as
rapid
and
eager
as
their
talk
besides
these
walks
george
eliot
chief
recreation
consisted
in
frequenting
concerts
and
picture
galleries
to
music
she
was
passionately
devoted
hardly
ever
failing
to
attend
at
the
saturday
afternoon
concerts
at
james
hall
besides
frequenting
various
musical
réunions
such
as
the
following
extract
from
one
of
her
letters
will
show
the
other
night
we
went
to
hear
the
bach
choir
a
society
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
got
together
by
jenny
lind
who
sings
in
the
middle
of
them
her
husband
acting
as
conductor
it
is
pretty
to
see
people
who
might
be
nothing
but
simply
fashionables
taking
pains
to
sing
fine
music
in
tune
and
time
with
more
or
less
success
one
of
the
baritones
we
know
is
a
g
who
used
to
be
a
swell
guardsman
and
has
happily
taken
to
good
courses
while
still
quite
young
another
is
a
handsome
young
g
not
of
the
unsatisfactory
but
of
the
r
g
kin
a
soprano
is
p
wife
of
the
queen
secretary
general
p
the
granddaughter
of
earl
grey
and
just
like
him
in
the
face
and
so
on
these
people
of
birth
are
certainly
reforming
themselves
a
little
she
likewise
never
omitted
to
visit
the
exhibition
of
old
masters
at
burlington
house
to
most
people
few
things
exercise
so
great
a
strain
on
their
mental
and
physical
powers
of
endurance
as
the
inspection
of
a
picture
gallery
with
its
incessant
appeal
to
the
most
concentrated
attention
yet
in
spite
of
physical
weakness
george
eliot
possessed
such
inexhaustible
mental
energy
that
she
could
go
on
hour
after
hour
looking
with
the
same
unflagging
interest
at
whatever
possessed
any
claim
to
attention
tiring
out
even
vigorous
men
that
were
in
her
company
in
her
works
the
allusions
to
art
are
much
less
frequent
than
to
music
but
from
a
few
hints
here
and
there
it
is
possible
to
form
some
idea
of
her
taste
one
very
significant
passage
in
showing
her
peculiar
love
of
dutch
paintings
and
her
readiness
to
turn
without
shrinking
from
angels
from
prophets
sibyls
and
heroic
warriors
to
an
old
woman
bending
over
her
flowerpot
or
eating
her
solitary
dinner
while
the
noonday
light
softened
perhaps
by
a
screen
of
leaves
falls
on
her
and
just
touches
the
rim
of
her
and
her
stone
jug
and
all
those
cheap
common
things
which
are
the
precious
necessaries
of
life
to
her
another
favourite
resort
of
george
eliot
was
the
zoological
gardens
she
went
there
a
great
deal
to
study
the
animals
and
was
particularly
fond
of
the
poor
dear
ratel
that
used
to
turn
somersaults
in
fact
her
knowledge
of
and
sympathy
with
animals
was
as
remarkable
as
that
which
she
showed
for
human
nature
thus
she
astonished
a
gentleman
farmer
by
drawing
attention
to
the
fine
points
of
his
horses
her
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
dog
comes
out
in
a
thousand
touches
in
her
novels
and
her
humorous
appreciation
of
little
pigs
led
her
to
watch
them
attentively
and
to
pick
out
some
particular
favourite
in
every
litter
in
her
country
rambles
too
she
was
fond
of
turning
over
stones
to
inspect
the
minute
insect
life
teeming
in
moist
dark
places
and
she
was
as
interested
as
lewes
himself
in
the
creatures
frogs
he
kept
for
scientific
purposes
and
which
would
sometimes
like
the
frog
in
the
fairy
tale
surprise
the
household
by
suddenly
making
their
entrance
into
the
her
liking
for
the
poor
brutes
as
she
calls
them
had
its
origin
no
doubt
in
the
same
source
of
profound
pity
which
she
feels
for
the
twists
and
cracks
of
imperfect
human
beings
her
evenings
were
usually
passed
at
home
and
spent
in
reading
or
in
playing
and
singing
but
she
and
lewes
used
to
go
to
the
theatre
on
any
occasion
of
special
interest
as
when
salvini
appeared
in
a
performance
attended
repeatedly
by
both
with
enthusiastic
delight
otherwise
they
rarely
left
home
seldom
visiting
at
other
houses
although
they
made
an
exception
in
the
case
of
a
favoured
few
they
were
both
fond
of
travelling
and
whenever
it
was
possible
would
take
trips
to
the
continent
or
seek
some
quiet
english
rural
retreat
away
from
the
sleepless
tumult
of
london
for
says
lewes
incidentally
in
a
letter
lewes
never
seems
at
home
except
under
a
broad
sweep
of
sky
and
the
of
the
uplands
round
her
so
we
find
them
frequently
contriving
a
change
of
scene
and
the
visits
to
foreign
countries
the
pleasant
sauntering
on
long
summer
days
through
continental
towns
dozing
round
old
cathedrals
formed
delightful
episodes
in
george
eliot
strenuously
active
life
the
residence
in
germany
in
and
again
in
has
already
been
alluded
to
now
in
the
year
they
paid
a
short
visit
to
france
in
the
course
of
which
they
saw
normandy
brittany
and
touraine
returning
much
refreshed
at
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
two
years
afterwards
they
went
to
spain
a
country
that
must
have
possessed
a
peculiar
interest
for
both
for
in
lewes
had
published
a
charming
if
little
book
on
spanish
drama
with
especial
reference
to
lope
de
vega
and
calderon
and
in
only
a
year
after
the
appearance
of
george
eliot
produced
the
first
draught
of
spanish
gypsy
on
becoming
personally
acquainted
with
this
land
of
old
romance
however
her
impressions
were
so
far
modified
and
deepened
that
she
and
amplified
her
poem
which
was
not
published
till
the
subject
of
the
gypsies
was
probably
suggested
to
george
eliot
by
her
own
memorable
adventure
in
childhood
which
thus
became
the
germ
of
a
very
impressive
poem
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
worth
noticing
that
the
conception
of
spanish
gypsy
should
have
followed
so
closely
on
the
completion
of
the
italian
novel
both
being
foreign
subjects
belonging
to
much
the
same
period
of
history
in
both
the
novelist
has
departed
from
her
habitual
track
seeking
for
pastures
new
in
a
foreign
soil
after
inculcating
on
the
artist
the
desirability
of
giving
the
loving
pains
of
a
life
to
the
faithful
representation
of
commonplace
things
she
remarks
in
bede
that
there
are
few
prophets
in
the
world
few
sublimely
beautiful
women
few
heroes
and
that
we
can
not
afford
to
give
all
our
love
and
reverence
to
such
rarities
but
having
followed
this
rule
and
given
the
most
marvellously
truthful
delineations
of
her
as
they
are
ordinarily
to
be
met
with
she
now
also
felt
prompted
to
draw
the
exceptional
types
of
human
character
the
rare
prophets
and
the
sublime
heroes
to
her
friend
miss
simcox
george
eliot
one
day
mentioned
a
plan
of
giving
the
world
an
ideal
portrait
of
an
actual
character
in
history
whom
she
did
not
name
but
to
whom
she
alluded
as
an
object
of
possible
reverence
unmingled
with
disappointment
this
idea
was
never
carried
out
but
at
any
rate
dinah
morris
savonarola
zarca
and
mordecai
are
all
exceptional
beings
beings
engrossed
by
an
impersonal
aim
having
the
spiritual
or
national
regeneration
of
their
for
its
object
dinah
and
savonarola
are
more
of
the
nature
of
prophets
zarca
and
mordecai
of
that
of
patriots
among
these
the
fair
methodist
preacher
whose
yearning
piety
is
only
a
more
sublimated
love
of
her
kind
is
the
most
vividly
realised
while
mordecai
the
patriot
of
an
ideal
country
is
but
the
abstraction
of
a
man
entirely
wanting
in
that
indefinable
solidity
of
presentation
which
gives
a
life
of
its
own
to
the
creations
of
art
on
the
whole
zarca
the
gipsy
chief
is
perhaps
the
most
vividly
drawn
of
george
eliot
purely
ideal
characters
characters
which
never
have
the
reality
of
her
poysers
her
silas
marners
and
her
dear
little
totties
and
eppies
yet
there
is
an
unmistakable
grandeur
and
power
of
invention
in
the
heroic
figure
of
zarca
although
in
spite
of
this
power
we
miss
the
convincing
stamp
of
reality
in
him
and
not
only
in
him
but
more
or
less
in
all
the
characters
of
the
gypsy
george
eliot
feeling
for
the
extraordinary
and
romantic
was
very
subordinate
to
that
which
she
entertained
for
the
more
familiar
aspects
of
our
life
for
although
she
here
chose
one
of
the
most
romantic
of
periods
and
localities
the
spain
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
with
the
mingled
horror
and
magnificence
of
its
national
traditions
she
does
not
really
succeed
in
resuscitating
the
spirit
which
animated
those
devout
cruel
fanatical
but
times
the
castilian
noble
the
jewish
astrologer
zarca
and
the
spanish
inquisitor
even
the
bright
fedalma
herself
think
and
speak
too
much
like
sublimated
modern
positivists
for
example
would
could
or
should
any
gipsy
of
the
fifteenth
century
have
expressed
himself
in
the
following
terms
oh
it
is
a
faith
taught
by
no
priest
but
by
this
beating
heart
faith
to
each
other
the
fidelity
of
in
a
desert
place
who
share
the
same
dire
thirst
and
therefore
share
the
scanty
water
the
fidelity
of
men
whose
pulses
leap
with
kindred
fire
who
in
the
flash
of
eyes
the
clasp
of
hands
the
speech
that
even
in
lying
tells
the
truth
of
heritage
inevitable
as
birth
nay
in
the
silent
bodily
presence
feel
the
mystic
stirring
of
a
common
life
which
makes
the
many
one
fidelity
to
the
consecrating
oath
our
sponsor
fate
made
through
our
infant
breath
when
we
were
born
the
of
that
small
island
life
where
we
must
dig
and
sow
and
reap
with
brothers
fear
thou
that
oath
my
daughter
nay
not
fear
but
love
it
for
the
sanctity
of
oaths
lies
not
in
lightning
that
avenges
them
but
in
the
injury
wrought
by
broken
bonds
and
in
the
garnered
good
of
human
trust
the
poetic
mode
of
treatment
corresponds
to
the
exalted
theme
of
the
gypsy
a
subject
certainly
more
fitted
for
drama
or
romance
rather
than
for
the
novel
properly
so
called
nothing
could
apparently
be
better
adapted
for
the
purposes
of
a
noble
historical
poem
than
the
conception
of
a
great
man
such
as
zarca
whose
aim
is
nothing
less
than
the
fusion
of
the
scattered
wandering
lawless
gypsy
tribes
into
one
nation
with
common
traditions
and
a
common
country
the
romantic
incident
of
the
discovery
of
his
lost
daughter
in
the
affianced
bride
of
silva
duke
of
bedmar
the
supreme
conflict
in
fedalma
breast
between
love
and
duty
her
renunciation
of
happiness
in
order
to
cast
in
her
lot
with
that
of
her
outcast
people
silva
frantic
grief
his
desertion
of
his
country
his
religion
and
all
his
solemn
responsibilities
to
turn
gypsy
for
fedalma
sake
and
having
done
so
his
agony
of
remorse
on
seeing
the
fortress
committed
to
his
trust
taken
by
the
gypsies
he
has
joined
his
dearest
friends
massacred
his
nearest
of
kin
isidor
the
inquisitor
hanged
before
his
very
eyes
a
sight
so
maddening
that
hardly
conscious
of
his
act
he
slays
zarca
and
so
divides
himself
for
ever
by
an
impassable
gulf
from
the
woman
for
whose
sake
he
had
turned
apostate
clearly
a
subject
containing
the
highest
capabilities
and
if
great
thoughts
constituted
a
great
poem
this
should
be
one
of
the
greatest
but
with
all
its
high
merits
its
sentiments
imbued
with
rare
moral
grandeur
its
felicitous
descriptions
the
work
lacks
that
best
and
incommunicable
gift
which
comes
by
nature
to
the
poet
here
as
in
her
novels
we
find
george
eliot
instinctive
insight
into
the
primary
passions
of
the
human
heart
her
wide
sympathy
and
piercing
keenness
of
vision
but
her
thoughts
instead
of
being
naturally
winged
with
melody
seem
mechanically
welded
into
song
this
applies
to
all
her
poetic
work
although
some
of
it
especially
the
of
jubal
reaches
a
much
higher
degree
of
metrical
and
rhythmical
excellence
but
although
george
eliot
poems
can
not
be
considered
on
a
par
with
her
prose
they
possess
a
distinctive
interest
and
should
be
carefully
studied
by
all
lovers
of
her
genius
as
affording
a
more
intimate
insight
into
the
working
of
her
own
mind
nowhere
do
we
perceive
so
clearly
as
here
the
profound
sadness
of
her
view
of
life
nowhere
does
she
so
emphatically
reiterate
the
stern
lesson
of
the
duty
of
resignation
and
or
that
other
doctrine
that
the
individual
is
bound
absolutely
to
subordinate
his
personal
happiness
to
the
social
good
that
he
has
no
rights
save
the
right
of
fulfilling
his
obligations
to
his
age
his
country
and
his
family
this
idea
is
perhaps
more
completely
incorporated
in
fedalma
than
in
any
other
of
her
characters
fedalma
who
seems
so
bountifully
endowed
with
the
fullest
measure
of
beauty
love
and
happiness
that
her
renunciation
may
be
the
more
absolute
she
who
in
her
young
joy
suddenly
knows
herself
as
an
aged
sorrow
exclaiming
i
will
not
take
a
heaven
haunted
by
shrieks
of
misery
this
deed
and
i
have
ripened
with
the
hours
it
is
a
part
of
me
a
wakened
thought
that
rising
like
a
giant
masters
me
and
grows
into
a
doom
o
mother
life
that
seemed
to
nourish
me
so
tenderly
even
in
the
womb
you
vowed
me
to
the
fire
hung
on
my
soul
the
burden
of
men
hopes
and
pledged
me
to
redeem
i
pay
the
debt
you
gave
me
strength
that
i
should
pour
it
all
into
this
anguish
i
can
never
shrink
back
into
bliss
my
heart
has
grown
too
big
with
things
that
might
be
this
sacrifice
is
the
completer
for
being
without
hope
for
not
counting
on
aught
but
being
faithful
for
resting
satisfied
in
such
a
sublime
conviction
as
the
grandest
death
to
die
in
vain
for
love
greater
than
sways
the
forces
of
the
world
limit
forbids
me
dwell
longer
on
this
poem
which
contains
infinite
matter
for
discussion
yet
some
of
the
single
passages
are
so
full
of
fine
thoughts
felicitously
expressed
that
it
would
be
unfair
not
to
allude
to
them
such
a
specimen
as
this
exposition
of
the
eternal
dualism
between
the
hellenic
and
the
christian
ideals
of
which
heine
was
the
original
and
incomparable
expounder
should
not
be
left
unnoted
for
evermore
with
grander
resurrection
than
was
feigned
of
attila
fierce
huns
the
soul
of
greece
conquers
the
bulk
of
persia
the
maimed
form
of
beauty
yet
breathing
with
the
thought
that
shaped
its
limbs
looks
mild
reproach
from
out
its
opened
grave
at
creeds
of
terror
and
the
god
fronts
the
pierced
image
with
the
crown
of
thorns
and
again
how
full
of
deep
mysterious
suggestion
is
this
line
speech
is
but
broken
light
upon
the
depth
of
the
unspoken
and
this
grand
saying
what
times
are
little
to
the
sentinel
that
hour
is
regal
when
he
mounts
on
guard
quotations
of
this
kind
might
be
indefinitely
multiplied
while
showing
that
exaltation
of
thought
properly
belonging
to
poetry
they
at
the
same
time
indubitably
prove
to
the
ear
the
absence
of
that
subtle
intuitive
music
that
linked
sweetness
of
sound
and
sense
which
is
the
birthright
of
poets
if
an
intimate
and
profound
acquaintance
with
the
laws
and
structure
of
metre
could
bestow
this
quality
which
appertains
to
the
elemental
george
eliot
verse
ought
to
have
achieved
the
highest
success
for
in
mere
technical
knowledge
concerning
rhyme
assonance
alliteration
and
the
manipulation
of
blank
verse
according
to
the
most
cunning
distribution
of
pauses
she
could
hold
her
own
with
the
foremost
contemporary
poets
being
no
doubt
far
more
versed
than
either
shelley
or
byron
in
the
laws
governing
these
matters
how
incalculable
she
felt
the
poet
influence
to
be
and
how
fain
she
would
have
had
him
wield
this
influence
only
for
the
loftiest
ends
is
well
shown
in
a
beautiful
letter
hitherto
unpublished
now
possessing
an
added
pathos
as
addressed
to
one
who
has
but
lately
departed
at
the
very
time
when
his
rare
poetic
gifts
were
beginning
to
be
more
widely
recognised
james
thomson
the
author
of
the
city
of
dreadful
night
a
poem
which
appeared
first
in
the
pages
of
the
reformer
with
the
signature
of
was
thus
addressed
by
george
eliot
dear
poet
i
can
not
rest
satisfied
without
telling
you
that
my
mind
responds
with
admiration
to
the
distinct
vision
and
grand
utterance
in
the
poem
which
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
send
me
also
i
trust
that
an
intellect
informed
by
so
much
passionate
energy
as
yours
will
soon
give
us
more
heroic
strains
with
a
wider
embrace
of
human
fellowship
such
as
will
be
to
the
labourers
of
the
world
what
the
odes
of
tyrtæus
were
to
the
spartans
thrilling
them
with
the
sublimity
of
the
social
order
and
the
courage
of
resistance
to
all
that
would
dissolve
it
to
accept
life
and
write
much
fine
poetry
is
to
take
a
very
large
share
in
the
quantum
of
human
good
and
seems
to
draw
with
it
necessarily
some
recognition
affectionate
and
even
joyful
of
the
manifold
willing
labours
which
have
made
such
a
lot
possible
these
words
are
of
peculiar
interest
because
although
the
writer
of
them
is
almost
as
much
of
a
pessimist
as
its
recipient
they
are
so
with
a
difference
the
pessimism
of
the
city
of
dreadful
night
in
its
blank
hopelessness
paralyses
the
inmost
nerve
of
life
by
isolating
the
individual
in
cold
obstruction
whereas
george
eliot
while
recognising
to
the
utmost
the
burthen
of
a
world
where
even
the
sunshine
has
a
heart
of
care
insists
the
more
on
the
fact
that
this
common
suffering
binds
man
more
indissolubly
to
man
that
so
far
from
justifying
him
in
ending
his
life
when
he
will
the
groaning
and
travailing
generations
exact
that
he
should
stand
firm
at
his
post
regardless
of
personal
consideration
or
requital
so
long
only
as
he
can
help
towards
making
the
fate
of
his
fellow
mortals
less
heavy
for
them
to
bear
in
fact
the
one
is
a
theory
of
life
the
other
a
disease
of
the
soul
the
same
stoic
view
in
a
different
form
finds
expression
in
this
answer
to
a
dear
friend
query
i
can
not
quite
agree
that
it
is
hard
to
see
what
has
been
the
good
of
your
life
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
you
have
been
a
good
of
a
kind
that
would
have
been
sorely
missed
by
those
who
have
been
nearest
to
you
and
also
by
some
who
are
more
distant
and
it
is
this
kind
of
good
which
must
reconcile
us
to
life
and
not
any
answer
to
the
question
would
the
universe
have
been
without
me
the
point
one
has
to
care
for
is
a
b
and
c
the
better
for
me
and
there
are
several
letters
of
the
alphabet
that
could
not
have
easily
spared
you
in
the
past
and
that
can
still
less
spare
you
in
the
present
this
lesson
of
resignation
which
is
enforced
more
and
more
stringently
in
her
writings
is
again
dwelt
upon
with
peculiar
emphasis
in
the
interesting
dramatic
sketch
entitled
the
problem
here
is
not
unlike
that
in
marner
it
is
that
of
an
individual
in
exceptional
circumstances
brought
back
to
the
average
condition
of
humanity
but
whereas
silas
having
sunk
below
the
common
standard
is
once
more
united
to
his
by
love
the
magnificently
endowed
armgart
who
seems
something
apart
and
above
the
crowd
is
reduced
to
the
level
of
the
undistinguished
million
by
the
loss
of
her
peerless
voice
is
the
single
instance
excepting
perhaps
the
princess
where
george
eliot
has
attempted
to
depict
the
to
whom
life
highest
object
consists
in
fame
the
benignant
strength
of
one
transformed
to
joy
of
many
but
in
the
intoxicating
flush
of
success
the
singer
who
has
refused
the
love
of
for
that
sense
transcendent
which
can
taste
the
joy
of
swaying
multitudes
loses
her
glorious
gift
and
so
sinks
irretrievably
to
a
drudge
among
the
crowd
in
the
first
delirium
of
despair
she
longs
to
put
an
end
to
herself
sooner
than
bear
the
yoke
of
thwarted
life
but
is
painfully
startled
from
her
defiant
mood
by
the
indignant
query
of
walpurga
her
humble
cousin
where
is
the
rebel
right
for
you
alone
noble
rebellion
lifts
a
common
load
but
what
is
he
who
flings
his
own
load
off
and
leaves
his
fellows
toiling
rebel
right
say
rather
the
deserter
oh
you
smiled
from
your
clear
height
on
all
the
million
lots
which
yet
you
brand
as
abject
it
may
seem
singular
that
having
once
in
drawn
a
woman
of
the
highest
artistic
aims
and
ambitions
george
eliot
should
imply
that
what
is
most
valuable
in
her
is
not
the
exceptional
gift
but
rather
that
part
of
her
nature
which
she
shares
with
ordinary
humanity
this
is
however
one
of
her
leading
beliefs
and
strongly
contrasts
her
as
a
teacher
with
carlyle
to
the
author
of
worship
the
promiscuous
mass
moiling
and
toiling
as
factory
hands
and
artisans
as
miners
and
labourers
only
represents
so
much
raw
material
from
which
is
produced
that
final
result
and
last
triumph
of
the
combination
of
human
forces
the
great
statesman
great
warrior
great
poet
and
so
forth
to
george
eliot
on
the
contrary
and
this
is
the
democratic
side
of
her
nature
it
is
the
multitude
so
charily
treated
by
destiny
which
claims
deepest
sympathy
and
tenderest
compassion
so
that
all
greatness
in
her
eyes
is
not
a
privilege
but
a
debt
which
entails
on
its
possessor
a
more
strenuous
effort
a
completer
devotion
to
the
service
of
average
humanity
chapter
xiii
felix
holt
and
middlemarch
in
holt
which
was
published
in
george
eliot
returned
once
more
to
her
own
peculiar
field
where
she
stands
supreme
and
unrivalled
the
novel
of
english
provincial
life
this
work
which
however
is
not
equal
to
her
earlier
or
later
fictions
yet
possesses
a
double
interest
for
us
it
is
the
only
one
of
her
writings
from
which
its
author
political
views
may
be
inferred
if
we
exclude
a
paper
published
in
in
january
which
indeed
seems
to
be
part
of
the
novel
seeing
that
it
is
entitled
address
to
working
men
by
felix
holt
the
paper
contains
in
a
more
direct
and
concise
form
precisely
the
same
general
views
as
regards
the
principles
of
government
which
were
previously
enunciated
through
felix
the
radical
it
was
an
appeal
to
the
operative
classes
who
had
been
only
recently
enfranchised
by
the
reform
bill
its
advice
is
mainly
to
the
effect
that
genuine
political
and
social
improvements
to
be
durable
must
be
the
result
of
inward
change
rather
than
of
outward
legislation
the
writer
insists
on
the
futility
of
the
belief
that
beneficial
political
changes
can
be
effected
by
revolutionary
measures
she
points
out
the
necessity
of
a
just
discrimination
between
what
is
curable
in
the
body
politic
and
what
has
to
be
endured
she
dwells
once
again
with
solemn
insistence
on
the
aged
sorrow
the
inheritance
of
evil
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
an
evil
too
intimately
entwined
with
the
complex
conditions
of
society
to
be
violently
uprooted
but
only
to
be
gradually
eradicated
by
the
persistent
cultivation
of
knowledge
industry
judgment
sobriety
and
patience
this
is
only
one
example
she
says
of
the
law
by
which
human
lives
are
linked
together
another
example
of
what
we
complain
of
when
we
point
to
our
pauperism
to
the
brutal
ignorance
of
multitudes
among
our
to
the
weight
of
taxation
laid
on
us
by
blamable
wars
to
the
wasteful
channels
made
for
the
public
money
to
the
expense
and
trouble
of
getting
justice
and
call
these
the
effects
of
bad
rule
this
is
the
law
that
we
all
bear
the
yoke
of
the
law
of
no
making
and
which
no
man
can
undo
everybody
now
sees
an
example
of
it
in
the
case
of
ireland
we
who
are
living
now
are
sufferers
by
the
of
those
who
lived
before
us
we
are
sufferers
by
each
other
and
the
children
who
come
after
us
will
be
sufferers
from
the
same
causes
to
remedy
this
and
suffering
so
argues
felix
holt
is
not
in
the
power
of
any
one
measure
class
or
period
it
would
be
childish
folly
to
expect
any
reform
bill
to
possess
the
magical
property
whereby
a
sudden
social
transformation
could
be
accomplished
on
the
contrary
abrupt
transitions
should
be
shunned
as
dangerous
to
order
and
law
which
alone
are
certain
to
insure
a
steady
collective
progress
the
only
means
to
this
end
consisting
in
the
general
spread
of
education
to
secure
which
at
least
for
his
children
the
working
man
should
spare
no
pains
without
knowledge
the
writer
continues
no
political
measures
will
be
of
any
benefit
ignorance
with
or
without
vote
always
of
necessity
engendering
vice
and
misery
but
guided
by
a
fuller
knowledge
the
working
classes
would
be
able
to
discern
what
sort
of
men
they
should
choose
for
their
representatives
and
instead
of
electing
platform
swaggerers
who
bring
us
nothing
but
the
ocean
to
make
our
broth
with
they
would
confide
the
chief
power
to
the
hands
of
the
truly
wise
those
who
know
how
to
regulate
life
according
to
the
truest
principles
mankind
is
in
possession
of
the
felix
holt
of
the
story
is
described
by
george
eliot
as
shaping
his
actions
much
according
to
the
ideas
which
are
here
theoretically
expressed
his
knowledge
and
aptitude
would
enable
him
to
choose
what
is
considered
a
higher
calling
but
he
scorns
the
vulgar
ambition
called
getting
on
in
the
world
his
sense
of
fellowship
prompting
him
to
remain
a
simple
artisan
that
he
may
exert
an
elevating
influence
on
the
class
to
which
he
belongs
class
differences
so
argues
this
being
inherent
in
the
constitution
of
society
it
becomes
something
of
a
desertion
to
withdraw
what
abilities
one
may
have
from
the
medium
where
they
are
urgently
needed
in
order
to
join
for
the
sake
of
selfish
aims
some
other
body
of
men
where
they
may
be
superfluous
the
other
distinctive
feature
of
holt
consists
in
its
elaborate
construction
ranking
it
so
to
speak
amongst
sensation
novels
as
a
rule
george
eliot
stories
have
little
or
no
plot
the
incidents
seeming
not
so
much
invented
by
the
writer
for
the
sake
of
producing
an
effective
work
as
to
be
the
natural
result
of
the
friction
between
character
and
circumstance
this
simplicity
of
narrative
belongs
no
doubt
to
the
highest
class
of
novel
the
class
to
which
vicar
of
wakefield
and
fair
belong
in
holt
however
the
intricate
network
of
incident
in
which
the
characters
seem
to
be
enmeshed
is
not
unlike
the
modern
french
art
of
with
its
fertility
of
invention
as
is
also
the
strangely
repellent
intrigue
which
forms
the
nucleus
of
the
whole
all
the
elements
which
go
to
make
up
a
thrilling
narrative
such
as
a
dubious
inheritance
the
disappearance
of
the
rightful
claimant
a
wife
guilty
secret
the
involvements
of
the
most
desperate
human
fates
in
a
perplexing
coil
through
sin
and
error
are
interwoven
in
this
story
of
holt
the
radical
though
ingeniously
invented
the
different
incidents
seem
not
so
much
naturally
to
have
grown
the
one
from
the
other
as
to
be
constructed
with
too
conscious
a
seeking
for
effect
there
is
something
forced
uneasy
and
inadequate
in
the
laborious
contrivance
of
fitting
one
set
of
events
on
to
another
and
the
machinery
of
the
disputed
transome
claim
is
so
involved
that
the
reader
never
masters
the
ins
and
outs
of
that
baffling
mystery
still
the
groundwork
of
the
story
is
deeply
impressive
its
interest
is
notwithstanding
the
complex
ramification
of
events
concentrated
with
much
power
upon
a
small
group
of
personages
such
as
transome
her
son
harold
the
little
dissenting
minister
rufus
lyon
esther
and
felix
holt
here
as
elsewhere
the
novelist
reveals
the
potent
qualities
of
her
genius
not
only
does
this
story
contain
such
genuine
humorous
portraiture
as
the
lachrymose
holt
and
the
delightfully
quaint
job
tudge
but
it
is
also
enriched
by
some
descriptions
of
rural
scenery
and
of
homely
existence
in
remote
country
districts
as
admirable
as
any
to
be
found
in
her
writings
rufus
lyon
is
a
worthy
addition
to
that
long
gallery
of
clerical
portraits
which
are
among
the
triumphs
of
george
eliot
art
this
apostle
of
the
meeting
in
skipper
lane
with
his
rare
purity
of
heart
his
unworldliness
his
zeal
in
the
cause
of
dissent
his
restless
argumentative
spirit
and
the
moving
memories
of
romance
and
passion
hidden
beneath
the
odd
quaint
of
the
little
minister
encased
in
rusty
black
is
among
the
most
loving
and
lovable
of
characters
and
recalls
more
particularly
that
passage
in
the
poem
entitled
minor
prophet
which
i
can
not
but
think
one
of
the
author
finest
the
passage
beginning
the
pathos
exquisite
of
lovely
minds
hid
in
harsh
forms
not
penetrating
them
like
fire
divine
within
a
common
bush
which
glows
transfigured
by
the
heavenly
guest
so
that
men
put
their
shoes
off
but
encaged
like
a
sweet
child
within
some
cell
who
leaps
and
fails
to
hold
the
but
having
shown
a
little
dimpled
hand
is
visited
thenceforth
by
tender
hearts
whose
eyes
keep
watch
about
the
prison
walls
esther
on
the
other
hand
is
one
of
those
fortunate
beings
whose
lovely
mind
is
lodged
in
a
form
of
corresponding
loveliness
this
charming
esther
though
not
originally
without
her
feminine
vanities
and
worldly
desires
is
one
of
those
characters
dear
to
george
eliot
heart
who
renounce
the
allurements
of
an
easy
pleasurable
existence
for
the
higher
satisfactions
of
a
noble
love
or
a
nobler
ideal
it
is
curious
to
notice
that
eppie
esther
fedalma
and
daniel
deronda
are
all
children
that
have
been
reared
in
ignorance
of
their
real
parentage
and
that
to
all
of
them
there
comes
a
day
when
a
more
or
less
difficult
decision
has
to
be
made
when
for
good
or
evil
they
have
to
choose
once
for
all
between
two
conflicting
claims
like
eppie
esther
rejects
the
advantages
of
birth
and
fortune
and
elects
to
share
the
hard
but
dignified
life
of
the
felix
but
this
decision
in
her
case
shows
even
higher
moral
worth
because
by
nature
she
is
so
keenly
susceptible
to
the
delicate
refinements
and
graceful
elegancies
which
are
the
natural
accompaniment
of
rank
and
wealth
the
most
curious
feature
of
this
book
consists
perhaps
in
its
original
treatment
of
illicit
passion
novelists
as
a
rule
when
handling
this
subject
depict
its
fascinations
in
brilliant
contrast
to
the
sufferings
and
terrors
which
follow
in
its
train
but
george
eliot
contents
herself
with
showing
us
the
reverse
side
of
the
medal
youth
has
faded
joy
is
dead
love
has
turned
to
loathing
yet
memory
like
a
relentless
fury
pursues
the
transome
who
hides
within
her
breast
such
a
heavy
load
of
shame
and
dread
the
power
and
intensity
with
which
this
character
of
the
haughty
stern
yet
inwardly
quailing
woman
is
drawn
are
unsurpassed
in
their
way
and
there
is
tragic
horror
in
the
recoil
of
her
finest
sensibilities
from
the
vulgar
mean
lawyer
too
ever
to
know
that
in
his
own
person
he
is
a
daily
judgment
on
her
whose
life
has
been
made
hideous
for
his
sake
never
more
impressively
than
here
does
the
novelist
enforce
her
teaching
that
the
deed
follows
the
doer
being
imbued
with
an
incalculable
vitality
of
its
own
shaping
all
after
life
and
subduing
to
its
guise
the
nature
that
is
in
bondage
to
it
like
those
fabled
dragon
teeth
planted
by
cadmus
which
spring
up
again
as
armed
men
spreading
discord
and
ruin
so
a
man
evil
actions
seem
endowed
with
independent
volition
and
their
consequences
extend
far
beyond
the
individual
life
where
they
originated
if
holt
is
the
most
intricately
constructed
of
george
novels
which
appeared
five
years
afterwards
is
on
the
other
hand
a
story
without
a
plot
in
fact
it
seems
hardly
appropriate
to
call
it
a
novel
like
hogarth
serial
pictures
representing
the
successive
stages
in
their
progress
through
life
of
certain
typical
characters
so
in
this
book
there
is
unrolled
before
us
not
so
much
the
history
of
any
particular
individual
as
a
whole
phase
of
society
portrayed
with
as
daring
and
uncompromising
a
fidelity
to
nature
as
that
of
hogarth
himself
in
english
provincial
life
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
indelibly
fixed
in
words
holding
a
universe
impalpable
for
the
apprehension
and
delight
of
the
furthest
generations
of
nations
here
as
in
some
kind
of
panorama
sections
of
a
community
and
groups
of
character
pass
before
the
mind
eye
to
dwell
on
the
separate
figures
which
constitute
this
great
crowd
would
be
impossible
within
the
present
limits
but
from
the
county
people
such
as
the
brookes
and
chettams
to
respectable
families
of
the
vincy
and
garth
type
down
to
the
low
avaricious
of
the
waules
and
featherstones
every
unit
of
this
complex
social
agglomeration
is
described
with
a
vividness
truly
amazing
when
the
number
and
variety
of
the
characters
especially
are
considered
i
know
not
where
else
in
literature
to
look
for
a
work
which
leaves
such
a
strong
impression
on
the
reader
mind
of
the
intertexture
of
human
lives
seen
thus
in
perspective
each
separate
individuality
with
its
specialised
consciousness
is
yet
as
indissolubly
connected
with
the
collective
life
as
that
of
the
indistinguishable
zoophyte
which
is
but
a
sentient
speck
necessarily
moved
by
the
same
vital
agency
which
stirs
the
entire
organism
among
the
figures
which
stand
out
most
prominently
from
the
crowded
background
are
dorothea
lydgate
casaubon
rosamond
vincy
ladislaw
bulstrode
caleb
and
mary
garth
dorothea
belongs
to
that
stately
type
of
womanhood
such
as
romola
and
fedalma
a
type
which
seems
to
be
specifically
george
eliot
own
and
which
has
perhaps
more
in
common
with
such
greek
ideals
as
antigone
and
iphigenia
than
with
more
modern
heroines
but
dorothea
however
lofty
her
aspirations
has
not
the
christian
heroism
of
romola
or
the
antique
devotion
of
fedalma
she
is
one
of
those
problematic
natures
already
spoken
of
to
her
circumstances
and
never
quite
adjusting
circumstances
to
herself
it
is
true
that
her
high
aims
and
glorious
possibilities
are
partially
stifled
by
a
social
medium
where
there
seems
no
demand
for
them
still
the
resolute
soul
usually
finds
some
way
in
which
to
work
out
its
destiny
many
says
george
eliot
have
been
born
who
found
for
themselves
no
epic
life
wherein
there
was
a
constant
unfolding
of
action
perhaps
only
a
life
of
mistakes
the
offspring
of
a
certain
spiritual
grandeur
with
the
meanness
of
opportunity
perhaps
a
tragic
failure
which
found
no
sacred
poet
and
sank
unwept
into
oblivion
with
dim
lights
and
tangled
circumstance
they
tried
to
shape
their
thought
and
deed
in
noble
agreement
but
after
all
to
common
eyes
their
struggles
seemed
mere
inconsistency
and
formlessness
for
these
were
helped
by
no
coherent
social
faith
and
order
which
could
perform
the
function
of
knowledge
for
the
ardently
willing
soul
some
have
felt
that
these
blundering
lives
are
due
to
the
inconvenient
indefiniteness
with
which
the
supreme
power
has
fashioned
the
natures
of
women
if
there
were
one
level
of
feminine
incompetence
as
strict
as
the
ability
to
count
three
and
no
more
the
social
lot
of
woman
might
be
treated
with
scientific
certitude
meanwhile
the
indefiniteness
remains
and
the
limits
of
variation
are
really
much
wider
than
any
one
would
imagine
from
the
sameness
of
women
coiffure
and
the
favourite
love
stories
in
prose
and
verse
such
a
life
of
mistakes
is
that
of
the
beautiful
dorothea
the
wife
of
casaubon
in
his
way
the
character
of
casaubon
is
as
great
a
triumph
as
that
of
tito
himself
the
novelist
seems
to
have
crept
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
that
uneasy
consciousness
to
have
probed
the
most
sensitive
spots
of
that
diseased
vanity
and
to
lay
bare
before
our
eyes
the
dull
labour
of
a
brain
whose
ideas
are
stillborn
in
an
article
by
myers
it
is
stated
however
incredible
it
may
sound
that
an
undiscriminating
friend
once
condoled
with
george
eliot
on
the
melancholy
experience
which
from
her
knowledge
of
lewes
had
taught
her
to
depict
the
gloomy
character
of
casaubon
whereas
in
fact
there
could
not
be
a
more
striking
contrast
than
that
between
the
pedant
groping
amid
dim
fragments
of
knowledge
and
the
vivacious
littérateur
and
thinker
with
his
singular
mental
energy
and
grasp
of
thought
on
the
novelist
laughingly
assuring
him
that
such
was
by
no
means
the
case
from
whom
then
persisted
he
did
you
draw
with
a
humorous
solemnity
which
was
quite
in
earnest
she
pointed
to
her
own
heart
she
confessed
on
the
other
hand
having
found
the
character
of
rosamond
vincy
difficult
to
sustain
such
complacency
of
egoism
as
has
been
pointed
out
being
alien
to
her
own
habit
of
mind
but
she
laid
no
claim
to
any
such
natural
magnanimity
as
could
avert
temptations
of
jealous
vanity
and
bitter
resentment
if
there
is
any
character
in
whom
one
may
possibly
trace
some
suggestions
of
lewes
it
is
in
the
versatile
brilliant
talented
ladislaw
who
held
that
while
genius
must
have
the
utmost
play
for
its
spontaneity
it
may
await
with
confidence
those
messages
from
the
universe
which
summon
it
to
its
peculiar
work
only
placing
itself
in
an
attitude
of
receptivity
towards
all
sublime
chances
but
however
charming
the
impression
ladislaw
produces
is
that
of
a
somewhat
shallow
frothy
character
so
that
he
seems
almost
as
for
dorothea
as
the
dreary
casaubon
himself
indeed
the
heroine
second
marriage
seems
almost
as
much
a
failure
as
the
stultifying
union
of
lydgate
with
rosamond
vincy
and
has
altogether
a
more
saddening
effect
than
the
tragic
death
of
maggie
which
is
how
much
less
pitiful
than
that
death
in
life
of
the
fashionable
doctor
whose
best
aims
and
vital
purposes
have
been
killed
by
his
wife
much
might
be
said
of
bulstrode
the
sanctimonious
hypocrite
who
is
yet
not
altogether
a
hypocrite
but
has
a
vein
of
something
resembling
goodness
running
through
his
crafty
character
of
farebrother
the
lax
amiable
genuinely
honourable
vicar
of
botolph
of
cadwallader
the
witty
meddling
rector
wife
a
kind
of
poyser
of
high
life
of
caleb
garth
whose
devotion
to
work
is
a
religion
and
whose
likeness
to
robert
evans
has
already
been
pointed
out
of
the
wholehearted
sensible
mary
and
of
many
other
supremely
vivid
characters
whom
to
do
justice
to
would
carry
us
too
far
is
the
only
work
of
george
eliot
i
believe
in
which
there
is
a
distinct
indication
of
her
attitude
towards
the
aspirations
and
clearly
formulated
demands
of
the
women
of
the
nineteenth
century
her
many
sarcastic
allusions
to
the
stereotyped
theory
about
sphere
show
on
which
side
her
sympathies
were
enlisted
on
the
whole
she
was
more
partial
to
the
educational
movement
than
to
that
other
agitation
which
aims
at
securing
the
political
enfranchisement
of
women
how
sincerely
she
had
the
first
at
heart
is
shown
by
the
donation
of
from
the
author
of
when
girton
college
was
first
started
and
in
a
letter
to
a
young
lady
who
studied
there
and
in
whose
career
she
was
much
interested
she
says
the
prosperity
of
girton
is
very
satisfactory
among
her
most
intimate
friends
too
were
some
of
the
ladies
who
had
initiated
and
organised
the
women
suffrage
movement
likewise
writing
to
miss
phelps
she
alludes
to
the
lectureship
in
boston
and
remarks
concerning
the
new
university
an
office
that
may
make
a
new
precedent
in
social
advance
and
which
is
at
the
very
least
an
experiment
that
ought
to
be
tried
america
is
the
and
nursery
of
new
ideals
where
they
can
grow
in
a
larger
freer
air
than
ours
in
the
year
when
was
appearing
in
parts
george
eliot
spent
part
of
the
spring
and
summer
months
at
shottermill
a
quaint
hampshire
village
situated
amid
a
landscape
that
unites
beauties
of
the
most
varied
kind
here
we
may
imagine
her
and
lewes
after
their
day
work
was
done
either
seeking
the
vast
stretch
of
heath
and
common
only
bounded
by
the
horizon
or
strolling
through
the
lanes
or
finding
a
soothing
repose
in
places
of
nestling
green
for
poets
made
they
had
rented
brookbank
an
cottage
with
tiled
roof
and
windows
belonging
to
gilchrist
the
widow
of
the
distinguished
biographer
of
william
blake
the
description
of
meyrick
house
in
deronda
where
the
narrow
spaces
of
wall
held
a
in
scenes
and
heads
may
have
been
suggested
by
her
present
abode
rich
in
original
drawings
by
blake
and
valuable
prints
and
george
eliot
writes
if
i
ever
steal
anything
in
my
life
i
think
it
will
be
the
two
little
sir
joshuas
over
the
mantelpiece
at
this
time
she
and
lewes
also
found
intense
interest
in
reading
the
of
blake
some
correspondence
kindly
placed
at
my
disposal
by
gilchrist
passed
between
this
lady
and
the
leweses
in
connection
with
the
letting
of
the
house
giving
interesting
glimpses
into
the
domesticities
of
the
latter
their
habits
here
as
in
london
were
of
clockwork
regularity
household
arrangements
being
expected
to
run
on
wheels
everything
writes
george
eliot
goes
on
slowly
at
shottermill
and
the
mode
of
narration
is
that
typified
in
is
the
house
that
jack
built
but
there
is
an
exquisite
stillness
in
the
sunshine
and
a
sense
of
distance
from
london
hurry
which
encourages
the
growth
of
patience
g
their
one
servant
pace
is
proportionate
to
the
other
slownesses
but
she
impresses
me
as
a
worthy
person
and
her
cooking
indeed
all
her
attendance
on
us
is
of
satisfactory
quality
but
we
find
the
awkwardness
of
having
only
one
person
in
the
house
as
well
as
the
advantage
this
latter
being
quietude
the
butcher
does
not
bring
the
meat
everybody
grudges
selling
new
milk
eggs
are
scarce
and
an
expedition
we
made
yesterday
in
search
of
fowls
showed
us
nothing
more
hopeful
than
some
chickens
six
weeks
old
which
the
good
woman
observed
were
sometimes
by
the
gentry
with
asparagus
those
eccentric
people
the
gentry
but
have
we
not
been
reading
about
the
siege
of
paris
all
the
winter
and
shall
we
complain
while
we
get
excellent
bread
and
butter
and
many
etceteras
s
kindly
sent
us
a
dish
of
asparagus
which
we
ate
without
the
skinny
chicken
and
had
a
feast
you
will
imagine
that
we
are
as
fond
of
eating
as
friar
tuck
i
am
enlarging
so
on
our
commissariat
but
you
will
also
infer
that
we
have
no
great
evils
to
complain
of
since
i
make
so
much
of
the
small
george
eliot
rarely
went
out
in
the
during
her
stay
at
shottermill
but
in
the
course
of
her
rambles
she
would
sometimes
visit
such
cottagers
in
remote
places
as
were
not
likely
to
know
who
she
was
she
used
also
to
go
and
see
a
farmer
wife
living
at
a
short
distance
from
brookbank
with
whom
she
would
freely
chat
about
the
growth
of
fruits
and
vegetables
and
the
quality
of
butter
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
simple
farm
people
speaking
of
her
recollection
of
the
great
novelist
to
an
american
lady
by
whom
these
facts
are
recorded
the
old
countrywoman
remarked
it
were
wonderful
just
wonderful
the
sight
o
green
peas
that
i
sent
down
to
that
gentleman
and
lady
every
week
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
months
spent
in
this
sweet
rural
retreat
george
eliot
again
writes
to
gilchrist
i
did
not
imagine
that
i
should
ever
be
so
fond
of
the
place
as
i
am
now
the
departure
of
the
bitter
winds
some
improvement
in
my
health
and
the
gradual
revelation
of
fresh
and
fresh
beauties
in
the
scenery
especially
under
a
hopeful
sky
such
as
we
have
sometimes
had
all
these
conditions
have
made
me
love
our
little
world
here
and
wish
not
to
quit
it
until
we
can
settle
in
our
london
home
i
have
the
regret
of
thinking
that
it
was
my
original
indifference
about
it
i
hardly
ever
like
things
until
they
are
familiar
that
hindered
us
from
securing
the
cottage
until
the
end
of
september
george
eliot
conscientiousness
and
precision
in
the
small
affairs
of
life
are
exemplified
in
her
last
note
to
gilchrist
after
lewes
had
written
to
you
i
was
made
aware
that
a
small
dessert
or
dish
had
been
broken
that
the
cat
was
credited
with
the
guilt
i
am
assured
by
g
that
nothing
else
has
been
injured
during
her
reign
and
l
confirmed
the
statement
to
me
yesterday
i
wish
i
could
replace
the
unfortunate
dish
this
note
of
course
needs
no
answer
and
it
is
intended
simply
to
make
me
a
clean
breast
about
the
crockery
about
this
time
george
eliot
was
very
much
out
of
health
indeed
both
she
and
lewes
repeatedly
speak
of
themselves
as
two
nervous
dyspeptic
creatures
two
ailing
susceptible
bodies
to
whom
slight
inconveniences
are
injurious
and
upsetting
although
it
was
hot
summer
weather
lewes
suffered
much
from
cold
sitting
always
with
artificial
heat
to
her
feet
one
broiling
day
in
august
after
she
had
left
brookbank
and
taken
another
place
in
the
neighbourhood
an
acquaintance
happening
to
call
on
her
found
her
sitting
in
the
garden
writing
as
was
her
wont
her
head
merely
shaded
by
a
deodara
on
the
lawn
being
expostulated
with
by
her
visitor
for
her
imprudence
in
exposing
herself
to
the
full
blaze
of
the
midday
sun
she
replied
oh
i
like
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
felt
warm
this
summer
they
led
a
most
secluded
life
george
eliot
being
at
this
time
engaged
with
the
continuation
of
and
lewes
alluding
to
their
solitary
habits
writes
at
this
date
work
goes
on
smoothly
away
from
all
friendly
interruptions
lord
houghton
says
that
it
is
incomprehensible
how
we
can
live
in
such
simeon
stylites
fashion
as
we
often
do
all
alone
but
the
fact
is
we
never
alone
when
alone
and
i
sometimes
marvel
how
it
is
i
have
contrived
to
get
through
so
much
work
living
in
london
it
true
i
a
london
child
occasionally
however
they
would
go
and
see
tennyson
whose
house
is
only
three
miles
from
shottermill
but
the
road
being
all
uphill
made
the
ride
a
little
tedious
and
uncomfortable
especially
to
george
eliot
who
had
not
got
over
her
old
nervousness
the
man
who
used
to
drive
them
on
these
occasions
was
so
much
struck
by
this
that
he
told
the
lady
who
has
recorded
these
details
in
the
withal
her
being
such
a
mighty
clever
body
she
were
very
nervous
in
a
carriage
allays
wanted
to
go
on
a
smooth
road
and
seemed
dreadful
feared
of
being
thrown
out
on
one
of
these
occasional
meetings
with
tennyson
the
poet
got
involved
in
a
conversation
with
the
novelist
concerning
evolution
and
such
weighty
questions
they
had
been
walking
together
in
close
argument
and
as
the
bade
george
eliot
farewell
he
called
to
her
already
making
her
way
down
the
hill
well
you
and
your
molecules
and
she
looking
back
said
in
her
deep
low
voice
which
always
got
lower
when
she
was
at
all
roused
i
am
quite
content
with
my
molecules
the
country
all
around
shottermill
with
its
breezy
uplands
its
hills
its
undulating
tracts
of
land
purpled
with
heath
in
the
autumn
became
more
and
more
endeared
to
george
eliot
who
indeed
liked
it
better
than
any
scenery
in
england
here
she
could
enjoy
to
the
full
that
sense
of
standing
on
a
round
world
which
she
writes
to
gilchrist
who
had
used
the
phrase
was
precisely
what
she
most
cared
for
amongst
delights
some
years
afterwards
we
find
her
and
lewes
permanently
taking
a
house
not
far
off
at
witley
in
surrey
which
has
the
same
kind
of
beautiful
open
scenery
writing
from
her
town
residence
about
it
to
her
old
friend
bray
george
eliot
says
we
too
are
thinking
of
a
new
settling
down
for
we
have
bought
a
house
in
surrey
about
four
miles
from
godalming
on
a
gravelly
hill
among
the
but
with
neighbours
to
give
us
a
sense
of
security
our
present
idea
is
that
we
shall
part
with
this
house
and
give
up
london
except
for
occasional
visits
we
shall
be
on
the
same
line
of
railway
with
some
good
friends
at
weybridge
and
guildford
chapter
xiv
daniel
deronda
deronda
which
appeared
five
years
after
occupies
a
place
apart
among
george
eliot
novels
in
the
spirit
which
animates
it
it
has
perhaps
the
closest
affinity
with
the
gypsy
speaking
of
this
work
to
a
young
friend
of
jewish
extraction
in
whose
career
george
eliot
felt
keen
interest
she
expressed
surprise
at
the
amazement
which
her
choice
of
a
subject
had
created
i
wrote
about
the
jews
she
remarked
because
i
consider
them
a
fine
old
race
who
have
done
great
things
for
humanity
i
feel
the
same
admiration
for
them
as
i
do
for
the
florentines
only
lately
i
have
heard
to
my
great
satisfaction
that
an
influential
member
of
the
jewish
community
is
going
to
start
an
emigration
to
palestine
you
will
also
be
glad
to
learn
that
helmholtz
is
a
jew
these
observations
are
valuable
as
affording
a
key
to
the
leading
motive
of
deronda
mordecai
ardent
desire
to
found
a
new
national
state
in
palestine
is
not
simply
the
author
dramatic
realisation
of
the
feeling
of
an
enthusiast
but
expresses
her
own
very
definite
sentiments
on
the
subject
the
jewish
apostle
is
in
fact
more
or
less
the
mouthpiece
of
george
eliot
own
opinions
on
judaism
for
so
great
a
master
in
the
art
of
creating
character
this
type
of
the
loftiest
kind
of
man
is
curiously
unreal
mordecai
delivers
himself
of
the
most
eloquent
and
exalted
views
and
sentiments
yet
his
own
personality
remains
so
vague
and
nebulous
that
it
has
no
power
of
kindling
the
imagination
mordecai
is
meant
for
a
jewish
mazzini
within
his
consciousness
he
harbours
the
future
of
a
people
he
feels
himself
destined
to
become
the
saviour
of
his
race
yet
he
does
not
convince
us
of
his
greatness
he
convinces
us
no
more
than
he
does
the
mixed
company
at
the
hand
and
banner
which
listens
with
pitying
incredulity
to
his
passionate
harangues
nevertheless
the
first
and
final
test
of
the
religious
teacher
or
of
the
social
reformer
is
the
magnetic
force
with
which
his
own
intense
beliefs
become
binding
on
the
consciences
of
others
if
only
of
a
few
it
is
true
mordecai
secures
one
disciple
the
man
destined
to
translate
his
thought
into
action
daniel
deronda
as
shadowy
as
as
lifeless
as
ezra
mordecai
cohen
himself
these
two
men
of
whom
the
one
is
the
spiritual
leader
and
the
other
the
hero
destined
to
realise
his
aspirations
are
probably
the
two
most
unsuccessful
of
george
eliot
vast
gallery
of
characters
they
are
the
representatives
of
an
idea
but
the
idea
has
never
been
made
flesh
a
succinct
expression
of
it
may
be
gathered
from
the
following
passage
which
among
the
chief
of
the
gentile
nations
has
not
an
ignorant
multitude
they
scorn
our
people
ignorant
observance
but
the
most
accursed
ignorance
is
that
which
has
no
observance
sunk
to
the
cunning
greed
of
the
fox
to
which
all
law
is
no
more
than
a
trap
or
the
cry
of
the
worrying
hound
there
is
a
degradation
deep
down
below
the
memory
that
has
withered
into
superstition
for
the
multitude
of
the
ignorant
on
three
continents
who
observe
our
rites
and
make
the
confession
of
the
divine
unity
the
lord
of
judaism
is
not
dead
revive
the
organic
centre
let
the
unity
of
israel
which
has
made
the
growth
and
form
of
its
religion
be
an
outward
reality
looking
towards
a
land
and
a
polity
our
dispersed
people
in
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
may
share
the
dignity
of
a
national
life
which
has
a
voice
among
the
peoples
of
the
east
and
the
west
which
will
plant
the
wisdom
and
skill
of
our
race
so
that
it
may
be
as
of
old
a
medium
of
transmission
and
understanding
let
that
come
to
pass
and
the
living
warmth
will
spread
to
the
weak
extremities
of
israel
and
superstition
will
vanish
not
in
the
lawlessness
of
the
renegade
but
in
the
illumination
of
great
facts
which
widen
feeling
and
make
all
knowledge
alive
as
the
young
offspring
of
beloved
memories
this
notion
that
the
jews
should
return
to
palestine
in
a
body
and
once
more
constitute
themselves
into
a
distinct
nation
is
curiously
repugnant
to
modern
feelings
as
repugnant
as
that
other
doctrine
which
is
also
implied
in
the
book
that
jewish
separateness
should
be
still
further
insured
by
strictly
adhering
to
their
own
race
in
marriage
at
least
mirah
the
most
faultless
of
george
eliot
heroines
whose
character
expresses
the
noblest
side
of
judaism
is
a
jewess
who
will
not
accept
any
one
but
a
jew
mirah
lapidoth
and
the
princess
deronda
mother
are
drawn
with
the
obvious
purpose
of
contrasting
two
types
of
jewish
women
whereas
the
latter
strictly
brought
up
in
the
belief
and
most
minute
observances
of
her
hebrew
father
breaks
away
from
the
bondage
of
having
been
born
a
jew
from
which
she
wishes
to
relieve
her
son
by
parting
from
him
in
infancy
mirah
brought
up
in
disregard
even
in
dislike
of
her
jewish
origin
clings
with
inviolable
tenacity
to
the
memory
of
that
origin
and
to
the
fellowship
of
her
people
the
author
leaves
one
in
little
doubt
as
towards
which
side
her
own
sympathies
incline
to
she
is
not
so
much
the
artist
here
impartially
portraying
different
kinds
of
characters
as
the
special
pleader
proclaiming
that
one
set
of
motives
are
righteous
just
and
praiseworthy
as
well
as
that
the
others
are
mischievous
and
reprehensible
this
seems
carrying
the
principle
of
nationality
to
an
extreme
if
not
pernicious
length
if
there
were
never
any
breaking
up
of
old
forms
of
society
any
fresh
blending
of
nationalities
and
races
we
should
soon
reduce
europe
to
another
china
this
unwavering
faithfulness
to
the
traditions
of
the
past
may
become
a
curse
to
the
living
a
rigidity
as
unnatural
as
it
is
dangerous
would
be
the
result
of
too
tenacious
a
clinging
to
inherited
memories
for
if
this
doctrine
were
strictly
carried
out
such
a
country
as
america
where
there
is
a
slow
amalgamation
of
many
allied
and
even
heterogeneous
races
into
a
new
nation
would
practically
become
impossible
indeed
george
eliot
does
not
absolutely
hold
these
views
she
considers
them
necessary
at
present
in
order
to
act
as
a
drag
to
the
too
rapid
transformations
of
society
in
the
most
interesting
paper
of
such
that
called
modern
hep
hep
hep
she
remarks
the
tendency
of
things
is
towards
quicker
or
slower
fusion
of
races
it
is
impossible
to
arrest
this
tendency
all
we
can
do
is
to
moderate
its
course
so
as
to
hinder
it
from
degrading
the
moral
status
of
societies
by
a
too
rapid
effacement
of
those
national
traditions
and
customs
which
are
the
language
of
the
national
genius
the
deep
suckers
of
healthy
sentiment
such
moderating
and
guidance
of
inevitable
movement
is
worthy
of
all
effort
considering
that
george
eliot
was
convinced
of
this
modern
tendency
towards
fusion
it
is
all
the
more
singular
that
she
should
in
deronda
have
laid
such
stress
on
the
reconstruction
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
of
a
jewish
state
singular
when
one
considers
that
many
of
the
most
eminent
jews
so
far
from
aspiring
towards
such
an
event
hardly
seem
to
have
contemplated
it
as
a
desirable
or
possible
prospect
the
sympathies
of
spinoza
the
mendelssohns
rahel
meyerbeer
heine
and
many
others
are
not
distinctively
jewish
but
humanitarian
and
the
grandest
as
well
as
truest
thing
that
has
been
uttered
about
them
is
that
saying
of
heine
the
country
of
the
jews
is
the
ideal
is
god
indeed
to
have
a
true
conception
of
jewish
nature
and
character
of
its
brilliant
lights
and
deep
shadows
of
its
pathos
depth
sublimity
degradation
and
wit
of
its
infinite
resource
and
boundless
capacity
for
suffering
one
must
go
to
heine
and
not
to
deronda
in
heine
expresses
the
love
and
longing
of
a
jewish
heart
for
jerusalem
in
accents
of
such
piercing
intensity
that
compared
with
it
mordecai
fervid
desire
fades
into
mere
abstract
rhetoric
nature
and
experience
were
the
principal
sources
of
george
inspiration
and
though
she
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
jews
her
experience
had
not
become
sufficiently
incorporated
with
her
consciousness
otherwise
instead
of
portraying
such
tame
models
of
perfection
as
deronda
and
mirah
she
would
have
so
mixed
her
colours
as
to
give
us
that
subtle
involvement
of
motive
and
tendency
as
of
in
the
sea
which
we
find
in
the
characters
of
making
and
in
her
own
finest
creations
such
as
maggie
silas
marner
dorothea
casaubon
and
others
in
turning
to
the
english
portion
of
the
story
there
is
at
once
greater
play
of
spontaneity
in
the
people
depicted
grandcourt
gascoigne
rex
davilow
sir
hugh
mallinger
and
especially
gwendolen
show
all
the
old
cunning
in
the
psychological
rendering
of
human
nature
curiously
enough
this
novel
consists
of
two
perfectly
distinct
narratives
the
only
point
of
junction
being
daniel
deronda
himself
who
as
a
jew
by
birth
and
an
english
gentleman
by
education
stands
related
to
both
sets
of
circumstances
the
influence
he
exerts
on
the
spiritual
development
of
gwendolen
seems
indeed
the
true
of
the
story
otherwise
there
is
no
intrinsic
connection
between
the
group
of
people
clustering
round
mordecai
and
that
of
which
gwendolen
is
the
centre
unless
it
be
that
the
author
wished
to
show
the
greater
intensity
of
aim
and
higher
moral
worth
of
the
jews
as
contrasted
with
these
purposeless
worldly
unideal
christians
of
the
nineteenth
century
compared
with
the
immaculate
mirah
gwendolen
harleth
is
a
very
naughty
spoiled
imperfect
specimen
of
maidenhood
but
she
has
life
in
her
and
one
speculates
as
to
what
she
will
say
and
do
next
as
if
she
were
a
person
among
one
acquaintances
on
that
account
most
readers
of
deronda
find
their
interest
engrossed
by
the
fate
of
gwendolen
and
the
conjugal
relations
between
her
and
grandcourt
this
is
so
much
the
case
that
one
suspects
her
to
have
been
the
first
idea
of
the
story
she
is
at
any
rate
its
most
attractive
feature
in
gwendolen
george
eliot
once
remarked
she
had
wished
to
draw
a
girl
of
the
period
fascinating
accomplished
of
beauty
she
has
every
outward
grace
combined
with
a
singular
inward
vacuity
the
deeper
aspects
of
life
are
undreamed
of
in
her
philosophy
her
religion
consists
in
a
vague
awe
of
the
unknown
and
invisible
and
her
ambition
in
the
acquisition
of
rank
wealth
and
personal
distinction
she
is
selfish
vain
frivolous
worldly
domineering
yet
not
without
sudden
impulses
of
generosity
and
jets
of
affection
something
there
is
in
her
of
undine
before
she
had
a
soul
something
of
a
gay
vivacious
unfeeling
sprite
who
recks
nothing
of
human
love
or
of
human
misery
but
looks
down
with
utter
indifference
on
the
poor
humdrum
mortals
around
her
whom
she
inspires
at
once
with
fear
and
fondness
something
also
of
the
princess
in
exile
who
in
time
of
famine
was
to
have
her
made
of
the
finest
bolted
flour
from
the
seven
thin
ears
of
wheat
and
in
a
general
decampment
was
to
have
her
silver
fork
kept
out
of
the
baggage
how
this
bewitching
creature
whose
iridescence
of
character
makes
her
a
psychological
problem
is
gradually
brought
to
accept
henleigh
grandcourt
in
spite
of
the
promise
she
has
given
to
lydia
glasher
his
discarded
victim
and
her
own
fleeting
presentiments
is
described
with
an
analytical
subtlety
unsurpassed
in
george
eliot
works
so
indeed
is
the
whole
episode
of
the
married
life
of
grandcourt
this
territorial
magnate
who
possesses
every
worldly
advantage
that
gwendolen
desired
is
worthy
as
a
study
of
character
to
be
placed
beside
that
of
casaubon
himself
gwendolen
girlish
type
of
egoism
which
loves
to
be
the
centre
of
admiration
here
meets
with
that
far
other
deadlier
form
of
an
exorbitant
egoism
conspicuous
for
its
intense
obstinacy
and
tenacity
of
rule
in
proportion
as
the
varied
susceptibilities
of
younger
years
are
stripped
away
this
cold
negative
nature
lies
with
a
kind
of
withering
blight
on
the
susceptible
gwendolen
roused
from
the
complacent
dreams
of
girlhood
by
the
realities
of
her
married
life
shrinking
in
helpless
repulsion
from
the
husband
whom
she
meant
to
manage
and
who
holds
her
as
in
a
vice
the
unhappy
woman
has
nothing
to
cling
to
in
this
terrible
inward
collapse
of
her
happiness
but
the
man
who
from
the
first
moment
when
his
eye
arrests
hers
at
the
gaming
table
at
leubronn
becomes
as
it
were
a
conscience
visibly
incarnate
to
her
this
incident
which
is
told
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
novel
recalls
a
sketch
by
dante
rossetti
where
mary
magdalene
in
the
flush
of
joyous
life
is
held
by
the
gaze
and
in
a
sudden
revulsion
from
her
old
life
breaks
away
from
companions
that
would
fain
hold
her
back
with
a
passionate
movement
towards
the
man
of
sorrow
this
impressive
conception
may
have
unconsciously
suggested
a
somewhat
similar
situation
to
the
novelist
for
that
george
eliot
was
acquainted
with
this
drawing
is
shown
by
the
following
letter
addressed
in
to
dante
rossetti
i
have
had
time
now
to
dwell
on
the
photographs
i
am
especially
grateful
to
you
for
giving
me
the
head
marked
june
it
is
exquisite
but
i
am
glad
to
possess
every
one
of
them
the
subject
of
the
magdalene
rises
in
interest
for
me
the
more
i
look
at
it
i
hope
you
will
keep
in
the
picture
an
equally
passionate
type
for
her
perhaps
you
will
indulge
me
with
a
little
talk
about
the
modifications
you
intend
to
introduce
the
relation
of
deronda
to
gwendolen
is
of
a
christlike
nature
he
is
her
only
moral
hold
in
the
fearful
temptations
that
assail
her
now
and
again
under
the
intolerable
irritations
of
her
married
life
temptations
which
grow
more
urgent
when
grandcourt
leads
his
wife
captive
after
his
fashion
in
a
yacht
on
the
mediterranean
for
the
intensest
form
of
hatred
is
that
rooted
in
fear
which
compels
to
silence
and
drives
vehemence
into
a
constructive
vindictiveness
an
imaginary
annihilation
of
the
detested
object
something
like
the
hidden
rites
of
vengeance
with
which
the
persecuted
have
made
a
dark
vent
for
their
rage
and
soothed
their
suffering
into
dumbness
such
hidden
rites
went
on
in
the
secrecy
of
gwendolen
mind
but
not
with
soothing
effect
rather
with
the
effect
of
a
struggling
terror
side
by
side
with
dread
of
her
husband
had
grown
the
which
urged
her
to
flee
from
the
pursuing
images
wrought
by
her
impulse
the
evil
wish
at
last
finds
fulfilment
the
murderous
thought
is
outwardly
realised
and
though
death
is
not
eventually
the
result
of
the
criminal
desire
it
yet
seems
to
the
unhappy
wife
as
if
it
had
a
determining
power
in
bringing
about
the
catastrophe
but
it
is
precisely
this
remorse
which
is
the
redeeming
quality
of
her
nature
and
awakens
a
new
life
within
her
in
this
quickening
of
the
moral
consciousness
through
guilt
we
are
reminded
although
in
a
different
manner
of
a
similar
process
full
of
pregnant
suggestions
described
in
nathaniel
hawthorne
it
will
be
remembered
that
donatello
leads
a
purely
instinctive
that
is
to
say
animal
existence
till
the
commission
of
a
crime
awakens
the
dormant
conscience
and
a
soul
is
born
in
the
throes
of
anguish
and
remorse
in
deronda
there
is
an
entire
absence
of
that
rich
genial
humour
which
seemed
spontaneously
to
bubble
up
and
overflow
her
earlier
works
whether
george
eliot
conception
of
the
jews
as
a
peculiarly
serious
race
had
any
share
in
bringing
about
that
result
it
is
difficult
to
say
at
any
rate
in
one
of
her
essays
she
remarks
that
the
history
and
literature
of
the
ancient
hebrews
gives
the
idea
of
a
people
who
went
about
their
business
and
pleasure
as
gravely
as
a
society
of
beavers
certainly
mordecai
deronda
and
mirah
are
preternaturally
solemn
even
the
cohen
family
are
not
presented
with
any
of
those
comic
touches
one
would
have
looked
for
in
this
great
humorist
only
in
the
boy
jacob
are
there
gleams
of
drollery
such
as
in
this
description
of
him
by
hans
meyrick
he
treats
me
with
the
easiest
familiarity
and
seems
in
general
to
look
at
me
as
a
christian
commodity
likely
to
come
down
in
price
remarking
on
my
disadvantages
with
a
frankness
which
seems
to
imply
some
thoughts
of
future
purchase
it
is
pretty
though
to
see
the
change
in
him
if
mirah
happens
to
come
in
he
turns
child
suddenly
his
age
usually
strikes
one
as
being
like
the
israelitish
garments
in
the
desert
perhaps
near
forty
yet
with
an
air
of
recent
production
a
certain
subdued
vein
of
humour
is
not
entirely
absent
from
the
portraiture
of
the
meyrick
family
a
delightful
group
who
had
their
little
oddities
streaks
of
eccentricity
from
the
mother
blood
as
well
as
the
father
their
minds
being
like
mediæval
houses
with
unexpected
recesses
and
openings
from
this
into
that
flights
of
steps
and
sudden
outlooks
but
on
the
whole
instead
of
the
old
humour
we
find
in
deronda
a
polished
irony
and
epigrammatic
sarcasm
which
were
afterwards
still
more
fully
developed
in
the
of
theophrastus
such
soon
after
the
publication
of
this
novel
we
find
the
following
allusion
to
it
in
one
of
george
eliot
letters
to
bray
i
do
know
what
you
refer
to
in
the
perhaps
the
report
of
hermann
adler
lecture
on
to
the
jewish
given
in
the
probably
the
adler
whom
you
saw
is
hermann
father
still
living
as
chief
rabbi
i
have
had
some
delightful
communications
from
jews
and
jewesses
both
at
home
and
abroad
part
of
the
club
scene
in
is
flying
about
in
the
hebrew
tongue
through
the
various
hebrew
newspapers
which
have
been
copying
the
in
which
the
translation
was
first
sent
to
me
three
months
ago
the
jews
naturally
are
not
indifferent
to
themselves
this
club
scene
gave
rise
at
the
time
to
quite
a
controversy
it
could
not
fail
to
be
identified
with
that
other
club
of
philosophers
out
at
elbows
so
vividly
described
by
lewes
in
the
of
nor
was
it
possible
not
to
detect
an
affinity
between
the
jew
cohen
the
poor
consumptive
journeyman
watchmaker
with
his
weak
voice
and
his
great
calm
intellect
and
ezra
mordecai
cohen
in
precisely
similar
conditions
the
difference
being
that
the
one
is
penetrated
by
the
philosophical
idea
of
spinozism
and
the
other
by
the
political
idea
of
reconstituting
a
jewish
state
in
palestine
this
difference
of
mental
bias
no
doubt
forms
a
contrast
between
the
two
characters
without
however
invalidating
the
surmise
that
the
fictitious
enthusiast
may
have
been
originally
suggested
by
the
noble
figure
of
the
living
jew
be
that
as
it
may
lewes
often
took
the
opportunity
in
conversation
of
pointing
out
that
no
such
resemblance
existed
cohen
being
a
keen
dialectician
and
a
highly
impressive
man
but
without
any
specifically
jewish
enthusiasm
when
she
undertook
to
write
about
the
jews
george
eliot
was
deeply
versed
in
hebrew
literature
ancient
and
modern
she
had
taught
herself
hebrew
when
translating
the
and
this
knowledge
now
stood
her
in
good
stead
she
was
also
familiar
with
the
splendid
utterances
of
with
the
visionary
speculations
of
the
cabbalists
and
with
the
brilliant
jewish
writers
of
the
epoch
she
had
read
portions
of
the
talmud
and
remarked
one
day
in
conversation
that
spinoza
had
really
got
something
from
the
cabbala
on
her
friend
humbly
suggesting
that
by
ordinary
accounts
it
appeared
to
be
awful
nonsense
she
said
that
it
nevertheless
contained
fine
ideas
like
plato
and
the
old
testament
which
however
people
took
in
the
lump
being
accustomed
to
them
chapter
xv
last
years
deronda
is
the
last
great
imaginative
work
with
which
george
eliot
was
destined
to
enrich
the
world
it
came
out
in
small
volumes
the
appearance
of
each
fresh
number
being
hailed
as
a
literary
event
in
allusion
to
an
author
feeling
on
the
conclusion
of
a
weighty
task
george
eliot
remarks
in
one
of
her
letters
as
to
the
great
novel
which
remains
to
be
written
i
must
tell
you
that
i
never
believe
in
future
books
always
after
finishing
a
book
i
have
a
period
of
despair
that
i
can
never
again
produce
anything
worth
giving
to
the
world
the
responsibility
of
the
writer
grows
heavier
and
heavier
does
it
not
as
the
world
grows
older
and
the
voices
of
the
dead
more
numerous
it
is
difficult
to
believe
until
the
germ
of
some
new
work
grows
into
imperious
activity
within
one
that
it
is
possible
to
make
a
really
needed
contribution
to
the
poetry
of
the
world
i
mean
possible
to
oneself
to
do
it
this
singular
diffidence
arising
from
a
sense
of
the
tremendous
responsibility
which
her
position
entailed
was
one
of
the
most
noticeable
characteristics
of
this
great
woman
and
struck
every
one
who
came
in
contact
with
her
her
conscientiousness
made
her
even
painfully
anxious
to
enter
sympathetically
into
the
needs
of
every
person
who
approached
her
so
as
to
make
her
speech
a
permanently
fruitful
influence
in
her
hearer
life
such
an
interview
for
example
as
that
between
goethe
and
heine
where
the
younger
poet
after
thinking
all
the
way
what
fine
things
to
say
to
goethe
was
so
disconcerted
by
the
presence
of
the
master
that
he
could
find
nothing
better
to
say
than
that
the
plums
on
the
between
jena
and
weimar
were
remarkably
good
would
have
been
impossible
with
one
so
eager
always
to
give
of
her
best
this
deep
seriousness
of
nature
made
her
sunday
afternoon
receptions
which
became
more
and
more
fashionable
as
time
went
on
something
of
a
tax
to
one
who
preferred
the
intimate
converse
of
a
few
to
that
more
superficially
brilliant
talk
which
a
promiscuous
gathering
brings
with
it
among
the
distinguished
visitors
to
be
met
more
or
less
frequently
at
the
priory

persons
of
celebrity
were
not
the
only
ones
however
that
were
made
welcome
at
the
priory
the
liveliest
sympathy
was
shown
by
both
host
and
hostess
in
many
young
people
as
yet
struggling
in
obscurity
but
in
whom
they
delighted
to
recognise
the
promise
of
some
future
excellence
if
a
young
man
were
pursuing
some
original
scientific
inquiry
or
striking
out
a
new
vein
of
speculation
in
all
london
there
was
none
likely
to
enter
with
such
zest
into
his
ideas
as
lewes
his
generous
appreciation
of
intellectual
gifts
is
well
shown
in
the
following
lines
to
the
late
professor
clifford
few
things
have
given
us
more
pleasure
than
the
intimation
in
your
note
that
you
had
a
may
she
be
the
central
happiness
and
motive
force
of
your
career
and
by
satisfying
the
affections
leave
your
intellect
free
to
work
out
its
glorious
destiny
for
if
you
do
become
a
glory
to
your
age
and
time
it
will
be
a
sin
and
a
shame
nature
does
often
send
forth
such
gifted
sons
and
when
she
does
society
usually
cripples
them
nothing
but
marriage
a
happy
marriage
has
seemed
to
lewes
and
myself
wanting
to
your
future
on
the
sunday
afternoon
receptions
just
mentioned
lewes
acted
so
to
speak
as
a
social
cement
his
vivacity
his
ready
tact
the
fascination
of
his
manners
diffused
that
general
sense
of
ease
and
so
requisite
to
foster
an
harmonious
flow
of
conversation
he
was
inimitable
as
a
and
thackeray
trollope
and
arthur
helps
were
fond
of
quoting
some
of
the
stories
which
he
would
dramatise
in
the
telling
one
of
the
images
which
on
these
occasions
recurs
oftenest
to
george
eliot
friends
is
that
of
the
woman
who
would
sit
with
her
chair
drawn
close
to
the
fire
and
whose
winning
womanliness
of
bearing
and
manners
struck
every
one
who
had
the
privilege
of
an
introduction
to
her
her
long
pale
face
with
its
features
was
less
rugged
in
the
mature
prime
of
life
than
in
youth
the
inner
meanings
of
her
nature
having
worked
themselves
more
and
more
to
the
surface
the
mouth
with
its
benignant
suavity
of
expression
especially
softening
the
too
prominent
and
massive
jaw
her
abundant
hair
untinged
with
grey
whose
smooth
bands
made
a
kind
of
frame
to
the
face
was
covered
by
a
lace
or
muslin
cap
with
lappets
of
rich
point
or
valenciennes
lace
fastened
under
her
chin
her
eyes
under
noticeable
eyelashes
expressed
the
same
acute
sensitiveness
as
her
long
thin
hands
she
had
a
pleasant
laugh
and
smile
her
voice
being
low
distinct
and
intensely
sympathetic
in
quality
it
was
contralto
in
singing
but
she
seldom
sang
or
played
before
more
than
one
or
two
friends
though
her
conversation
was
perfectly
easy
each
sentence
was
as
finished
as
perfectly
formed
as
the
style
of
her
published
works
indeed
she
laid
great
stress
on
the
value
of
correct
speaking
and
clearness
of
enunciation
and
in
such
she
laments
the
general
ambition
to
speak
every
language
except
our
mother
english
which
persons
style
are
not
ashamed
of
corrupting
with
slang
false
foreign
equivalents
and
a
pronunciation
that
crushes
out
all
colour
from
the
vowels
and
jams
them
between
jostling
consonants
besides
genevese
portrait
of
george
eliot
we
have
a
drawing
by
burton
and
another
by
lawrence
the
latter
taken
soon
after
the
publication
of
bede
in
criticising
the
latter
likeness
a
keen
observer
of
human
nature
remarked
that
it
conveyed
no
indication
of
the
infinite
depth
of
her
observant
eye
nor
of
that
cold
subtle
and
unconscious
cruelty
of
expression
which
might
occasionally
be
detected
there
george
eliot
had
an
unconquerable
aversion
to
her
likeness
being
taken
once
however
in
she
was
photographed
for
the
sake
of
her
dear
sisters
at
rosehill
but
she
seems
to
have
repented
of
this
weakness
for
after
the
lapse
of
years
she
writes
lewes
has
just
come
to
me
after
reading
your
letter
and
says
god
sake
tell
her
not
to
have
the
photograph
reproduced
and
i
had
nearly
forgotten
to
say
that
the
fading
is
what
i
desired
i
should
not
like
this
image
to
be
perpetuated
it
needs
the
friendly
eyes
that
regret
to
see
it
fade
and
must
not
be
recalled
into
emphatic
black
and
white
for
indifferent
gazers
pray
let
it
vanish
those
who
knew
george
eliot
were
even
more
struck
by
the
force
of
her
entire
personality
than
by
her
writings
sympathetic
witty
or
learned
in
turn
her
conversation
deeply
impressed
her
hearers
being
enriched
by
such
felicities
of
expression
as
the
best
lesson
of
tolerance
we
have
to
learn
is
to
tolerate
intolerance
in
answer
to
a
surprise
that
a
clever
man
should
allow
himself
to
be
contradicted
by
a
stupid
one
without
dropping
down
on
him
she
remarked
he
is
very
liable
to
drop
down
as
a
baked
apple
would
and
of
a
very
plain
acquaintance
she
said
he
has
the
most
dreadful
kind
of
ugliness
one
can
be
afflicted
with
because
it
takes
on
the
semblance
of
beauty
poetry
music
and
art
naturally
absorbed
much
attention
at
the
priory
here
tennyson
has
been
known
to
read
aloud
to
his
friends
browning
expatiated
on
the
most
recondite
metrical
rules
and
rossetti
sent
presents
of
poems
and
photographs
in
the
following
unpublished
letters
george
eliot
thanks
the
latter
for
his
valued
gifts
we
returned
only
the
night
before
last
from
a
two
journey
to
the
continent
and
among
the
parcels
awaiting
me
i
found
your
generous
gift
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
both
as
giver
and
poet
in
cutting
the
leaves
while
my
head
is
still
swimming
from
the
journey
i
have
not
resisted
the
temptation
to
read
many
things
as
they
ought
not
to
be
read
hurriedly
but
even
in
this
way
i
have
received
a
stronger
impression
than
any
fresh
poems
have
for
a
long
while
given
me
that
to
read
once
is
a
reason
for
reading
again
the
sonnets
towards
house
of
life
attract
me
peculiarly
i
feel
about
them
as
i
do
about
a
new
cahier
of
music
which
i
have
been
here
and
there
with
the
delightful
conviction
that
i
have
a
great
deal
to
become
acquainted
with
and
to
like
better
and
better
and
again
in
acknowledgment
of
some
photographs
the
seems
to
me
perfectly
intelligible
and
altogether
admirable
in
conception
except
in
the
type
of
the
man
head
i
feel
sure
that
had
a
square
anterior
lobe
lewes
says
this
conception
of
yours
makes
him
long
to
be
an
actor
who
has
for
one
of
his
parts
that
he
might
carry
out
this
scene
according
to
your
idea
one
is
always
liable
to
mistake
prejudices
for
sufficient
inductions
about
types
of
head
and
face
as
well
as
about
all
other
things
i
have
some
impressions
perhaps
only
prejudices
dependent
on
the
narrowness
of
my
experience
about
forms
of
eyebrow
and
their
relation
to
passionate
expression
it
is
possible
that
such
a
supposed
relation
has
a
real
anatomical
basis
but
in
many
particulars
facial
expression
is
like
the
expression
of
the
relations
are
too
subtle
and
intricate
to
be
detected
and
only
shallowness
is
confident
george
eliot
read
but
little
contemporary
fiction
being
usually
absorbed
in
the
study
of
some
particular
subject
for
my
own
spiritual
good
i
need
all
other
sort
of
reading
she
says
more
than
i
need
fiction
i
know
nothing
of
contemporary
english
novelists
with
the
exception
of
and
a
few
of
works
my
constant
groan
is
that
i
must
leave
so
much
of
the
greatest
writing
which
the
centuries
have
sifted
for
me
unread
for
want
of
time
for
the
same
reason
on
being
recommended
by
a
literary
friend
to
read
walt
whitman
she
hesitated
on
the
ground
of
his
not
containing
anything
spiritually
needful
for
her
but
having
been
induced
to
take
him
up
she
changed
her
opinion
and
admitted
that
he
contain
what
was
good
for
her
soul
as
to
lighter
reading
she
was
fond
of
books
of
travel
pronouncing
voyage
of
the
challenger
a
splendid
book
among
foreign
novelists
she
was
very
partial
to
henry
gréville
and
speaks
of
koumiassine
as
a
pleasant
story
persons
who
were
privileged
enough
to
be
admitted
to
the
intimacy
of
george
eliot
and
lewes
could
not
fail
to
be
impressed
by
the
immense
admiration
which
they
had
for
one
another
lewes
tenderness
always
on
the
watch
lest
the
great
writer
with
her
delicately
poised
health
should
herself
had
something
of
doglike
fidelity
on
the
other
hand
in
spite
of
george
eliot
habitually
retiring
manner
if
any
one
ever
engaged
on
the
opposite
side
of
an
argument
to
that
maintained
by
the
brilliant
in
taking
his
part
she
usually
had
the
best
of
it
although
in
the
most
gentle
and
feminine
way
although
there
was
entire
oneness
of
feeling
between
them
there
was
no
unanimity
of
opinion
george
eliot
had
the
highest
regard
for
opinions
but
held
to
her
own
one
of
the
chief
subjects
of
difference
consisted
in
their
attitude
towards
christianity
whereas
he
was
its
uncompromising
opponent
she
had
the
greatest
sympathy
with
its
various
manifestations
from
roman
catholic
asceticism
to
evangelical
austerity
and
methodist
fervour
her
reverence
for
every
form
of
worship
in
which
mankind
has
more
or
less
consciously
embodied
its
sense
of
the
mystery
of
all
this
unintelligible
world
increased
with
the
years
she
was
deeply
penetrated
by
that
tendency
of
the
positivist
spirit
which
recognises
the
beneficial
element
in
every
form
of
religion
and
sees
the
close
nay
indissoluble
connection
between
the
faith
of
former
generations
and
the
ideal
of
our
own
she
herself
found
ample
scope
for
the
needs
and
aspirations
of
her
spiritual
nature
in
the
religion
of
humanity
as
has
already
been
repeatedly
pointed
out
there
runs
through
all
her
works
the
same
persistent
teaching
of
the
infinite
nature
of
duty
and
with
comte
she
refers
the
obligations
of
duty
as
well
as
all
sentiments
of
devotion
to
a
concrete
object
at
once
ideal
and
real
the
human
race
conceived
as
a
continuous
whole
including
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
though
george
eliot
drew
many
of
her
ideas
of
moral
cultivation
from
the
doctrines
of
comte
she
was
not
a
positivist
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
her
mind
was
far
too
creative
by
nature
to
give
an
unqualified
adhesion
to
such
a
system
as
comte
indeed
her
devotion
to
the
idea
of
mankind
conceived
as
a
collective
whole
is
not
so
much
characteristic
of
positivists
as
of
the
greatest
modern
minds
minds
such
as
lessing
bentham
shelley
mill
mazzini
and
victor
hugo
inasmuch
as
comte
these
ideas
into
a
consistent
doctrine
george
eliot
found
herself
greatly
attracted
to
his
system
and
beesly
after
an
acquaintance
of
eighteen
years
considered
himself
justified
in
stating
that
her
powerful
intellect
had
accepted
the
teaching
of
auguste
comte
and
that
she
looked
forward
to
the
reorganisation
of
belief
on
the
lines
which
he
had
laid
down
still
her
adherence
like
that
of
lewes
was
only
partial
and
applied
mainly
to
his
philosophy
and
not
to
his
scheme
of
social
policy
she
went
farther
than
the
latter
however
in
her
concurrence
for
lewes
speaking
of
the
in
his
of
philosophy
admits
that
his
antagonistic
attitude
had
been
considerably
modified
on
learning
from
the
remark
of
one
very
dear
to
him
to
regard
it
as
an
utopia
presenting
hypotheses
rather
than
doctrines
suggestions
for
future
inquiries
rather
than
dogmas
for
adepts
on
the
whole
although
george
eliot
did
not
agree
with
comte
later
theories
concerning
the
reconstruction
of
society
she
regarded
them
with
sympathy
as
the
efforts
of
an
individual
to
anticipate
the
work
of
future
generations
this
sympathy
with
the
general
positivist
movement
she
showed
by
subscribing
regularly
to
positivist
objects
especially
to
the
fund
of
the
central
organisation
presided
over
by
laffitte
but
she
invariably
refused
all
membership
with
the
positivist
community
in
conversation
with
an
old
and
valued
friend
she
also
repeatedly
expressed
her
objection
to
much
in
comte
later
speculations
saying
on
one
occasion
i
can
not
submit
my
intellect
or
my
soul
to
the
guidance
of
comte
the
fact
is
that
although
george
eliot
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
leading
positivist
ideas
her
mind
was
too
original
not
to
work
out
her
own
individual
conception
of
life
what
this
conception
is
has
been
already
indicated
so
far
as
space
would
permit
in
the
discussion
of
her
successive
works
perhaps
in
the
course
of
time
her
moralising
analytical
tendency
encroached
too
much
on
the
purely
artistic
faculty
her
eminently
dramatic
genius
which
enabled
her
to
realise
characters
the
most
varied
and
opposite
in
type
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
shakespeare
became
hampered
by
theories
and
abstract
views
of
life
this
was
especially
shown
in
her
latest
work
impressions
of
theophrastus
such
a
series
of
essays
chiefly
satirising
the
weaknesses
and
vanities
of
the
literary
class
in
these
unattractive
impressions
the
wit
is
often
laboured
and
does
not
play
beneficently
round
the
changing
facets
of
egoism
absurdity
and
vice
as
the
sunshine
over
the
rippling
sea
or
the
dewy
meadows
its
cutting
irony
and
incisive
ridicule
are
no
longer
tempered
by
the
humorous
laugh
but
have
the
corrosive
quality
of
some
acrid
chemical
substance
one
of
the
papers
however
that
entitled
the
moral
currency
expresses
a
strongly
marked
characteristic
of
george
eliot
mind
it
is
a
pithy
protest
against
the
tendency
of
the
present
generation
to
turn
the
grandest
deeds
and
noblest
works
of
art
into
food
for
laughter
for
she
hated
nothing
so
much
as
mockery
and
ridicule
of
what
other
people
reverenced
often
remarking
that
those
who
considered
themselves
freest
from
superstitious
fancies
were
the
most
intolerant
she
carried
this
feeling
to
such
a
pitch
that
she
even
disliked
a
book
like
in
wonderland
because
it
laughed
at
the
things
which
children
had
had
a
kind
of
belief
in
in
censuring
this
vicious
habit
of
burlesquing
the
things
that
ought
to
be
regarded
with
awe
and
admiration
she
remarks
let
a
greedy
buffoonery
debase
all
historic
beauty
majesty
and
pathos
and
the
more
you
heap
up
the
desecrated
symbols
the
greater
will
be
the
lack
of
the
ennobling
emotions
which
subdue
the
tyranny
of
suffering
and
make
ambition
one
with
virtue
backward
is
the
only
paper
in
such
quite
free
from
cynicism
it
contains
under
a
slightly
veiled
form
pathetically
tender
reminiscences
of
her
own
early
life
this
volume
not
published
till
may
was
written
before
the
incalculable
loss
which
befell
george
eliot
in
the
autumn
of
the
preceding
year
after
spending
the
summer
of
in
the
pleasant
retirement
of
witley
lewes
and
george
eliot
returned
to
london
a
severe
cold
taken
by
lewes
proved
the
forerunner
of
a
serious
disorder
and
after
a
short
illness
this
bright
indefatigable
thinker
passed
away
in
his
year
he
had
frequently
said
to
his
friends
that
the
most
desirable
end
of
a
life
was
a
painless
death
and
although
his
own
could
not
be
called
painless
his
sufferings
were
at
least
of
short
duration
concerning
the
suffering
and
anguish
of
her
who
was
left
behind
to
mourn
him
one
may
most
fitly
say
in
her
own
words
that
for
the
first
sharp
pangs
there
is
no
comfort
whatever
goodness
may
surround
us
darkness
and
silence
still
hang
about
our
pain
in
her
case
also
the
clinging
companionship
with
the
dead
was
gradually
linked
with
her
living
affections
and
she
found
alleviation
for
her
sorrow
in
resuming
those
habits
of
continuous
mental
occupation
which
had
become
second
nature
with
her
in
a
letter
addressed
to
a
friend
who
only
a
few
short
months
afterwards
suffered
a
like
heavy
bereavement
there
breathes
the
spirit
in
which
george
eliot
bore
her
own
sorrow
i
understand
it
all
there
is
but
one
refuge
the
having
much
to
do
you
have
the
mother
duties
not
that
these
can
yet
make
your
life
other
than
a
burden
to
be
patiently
borne
nothing
can
except
the
gradual
adaptation
of
your
soul
to
the
new
conditions
it
is
among
my
most
cherished
memories
that
i
knew
your
husband
and
from
the
first
delighted
in
him
all
blessing
and
even
the
sorrow
that
is
a
form
of
love
has
a
heart
of
blessing
is
tenderly
wished
for
you
on
seeing
this
lady
for
the
first
time
after
their
mutual
loss
george
eliot
asked
her
eagerly
do
the
children
help
does
it
make
any
difference
some
help
there
was
for
the
widowed
heart
of
this
sorrowing
woman
in
throwing
herself
with
all
her
energies
into
the
work
which
lewes
had
left
unfinished
at
his
death
and
preparing
it
for
publication
with
the
help
of
an
expert
another
subject
which
occupied
her
thoughts
at
this
time
was
the
foundation
of
the
george
henry
lewes
studentship
in
order
to
commemorate
the
name
of
one
who
had
done
so
much
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
varied
fields
of
literature
science
and
philosophy
the
value
of
the
studentship
is
slightly
under
a
year
it
is
worth
noticing
that
persons
of
both
sexes
are
received
as
candidates
the
object
of
the
endowment
is
to
encourage
the
prosecution
of
original
research
in
physiology
a
science
to
whose
study
lewes
had
devoted
himself
most
assiduously
for
many
years
writing
of
this
matter
to
a
young
lady
one
of
the
girton
students
george
eliot
says
i
know
will
be
glad
to
hear
also
that
both
in
england
and
germany
the
type
or
scheme
on
which
the
studentship
is
arranged
has
been
regarded
with
satisfaction
as
likely
to
be
a
useful
model
amid
such
preoccupations
and
the
preparation
of
such
for
the
press
the
months
passed
on
and
george
eliot
was
beginning
to
see
her
friends
again
when
one
day
she
not
only
took
the
world
but
her
intimate
circle
by
surprise
by
her
marriage
with
john
walter
cross
on
the
of
may
the
acquaintance
with
this
gentleman
dating
from
the
year
had
long
ago
grown
into
the
warmest
friendship
and
his
boundless
devotion
to
the
great
woman
whose
society
was
to
him
as
his
daily
bread
no
doubt
induced
her
to
take
a
step
which
could
not
fail
to
startle
even
those
who
loved
her
the
most
but
george
was
a
nature
that
needed
some
one
especially
to
love
and
though
that
precious
companionship
at
once
stimulating
and
sympathetic
which
she
had
so
long
enjoyed
was
taken
from
her
she
could
still
find
comfort
during
the
remainder
of
her
life
in
the
love
the
appreciation
and
the
tender
care
which
were
proffered
to
her
by
cross
unfortunately
her
life
was
not
destined
to
be
prolonged
although
seeming
fairly
well
at
this
date
george
eliot
health
always
delicate
had
probably
received
a
shock
from
which
it
never
recovered
only
six
months
before
her
marriage
three
eminent
medical
men
were
attending
her
for
a
painful
disease
however
there
seemed
still
a
prospect
of
happiness
for
her
when
she
and
cross
went
for
a
tour
in
italy
settling
on
their
return
at
her
favourite
country
house
at
witley
in
the
autumn
they
once
more
made
their
home
in
london
at
cross
town
house
at
cheyne
walk
chelsea
and
cross
who
was
again
beginning
to
receive
her
friends
seemed
to
all
appearances
well
and
happy
with
a
prospect
of
domestic
love
and
unimpaired
mental
activity
stretching
out
before
her
but
it
was
not
to
be
on
friday
the
of
december
george
eliot
attended
a
representation
of
the
in
greek
by
oxford
undergraduates
and
was
so
stirred
by
the
grand
words
of
her
favourite
æschylus
that
she
was
contemplating
a
fresh
perusal
of
the
greek
dramatists
with
her
husband
on
the
following
day
she
went
to
the
saturday
popular
concert
and
on
returning
home
played
through
some
of
the
music
she
had
been
hearing
her
fatal
cold
was
probably
caught
on
that
occasion
for
although
she
received
her
friends
according
to
custom
on
the
sunday
afternoon
she
felt
indisposed
in
the
evening
and
on
the
following
day
an
affection
of
the
larynx
necessitated
medical
advice
there
seemed
no
cause
for
alarm
at
first
till
on
wednesday
it
was
unexpectedly
discovered
that
inflammation
had
arisen
in
the
heart
and
that
no
hope
of
recovery
remained
before
midnight
of
the
of
december
george
eliot
who
died
at
precisely
the
same
age
as
lewes
had
passed
quietly
and
painlessly
away
and
on
christmas
eve
the
announcement
of
her
death
was
received
with
general
grief
she
was
buried
by
the
side
of
george
henry
lewes
in
the
cemetery
at
highgate
george
eliot
career
has
been
habitually
described
as
uniform
and
uneventful
in
reality
nothing
is
more
misleading
on
the
contrary
her
life
from
its
rising
to
its
setting
describes
an
astonishingly
wide
orbit
if
one
turns
back
in
imagination
from
the
little
staffordshire
village
whence
her
father
sprang
to
the
simple
rural
surroundings
of
her
own
youth
and
traces
her
history
to
the
moment
when
a
crowd
of
mourners
consisting
of
the
most
distinguished
men
and
women
in
england
followed
her
to
the
grave
one
can
not
help
realising
how
truly
eventful
was
the
life
of
her
who
now
joined
in
spirit
the
choir
invisible
of
those
immortal
dead
who
live
again
in
minds
made
better
by
their
presence
live
in
pulses
stirred
to
generosity
in
deeds
of
daring
rectitude
in
scorn
for
miserable
aims

end
in
