chapter
i
wiggs
philosophy
in
the
mud
and
scum
of
things
something
always
always
sings
my
but
it
nice
an
cold
this
mornin
the
thermometer
done
fell
up
to
zero
wiggs
made
the
statement
as
cheerfully
as
if
her
elbows
were
not
sticking
out
through
the
boy
coat
that
she
wore
or
her
teeth
chattering
in
her
head
like
a
pair
of
castanets
but
then
wiggs
was
a
philosopher
and
the
sum
and
substance
of
her
philosophy
lay
in
keeping
the
dust
off
her
spectacles
when
wiggs
traveled
to
eternity
by
the
alcohol
route
she
buried
his
faults
with
him
and
for
want
of
better
virtues
to
extol
she
always
laid
stress
on
the
fine
hand
he
wrote
it
was
the
same
way
when
their
little
country
home
burned
and
she
had
to
come
to
the
city
to
seek
work
her
one
comment
was
thank
god
it
was
the
pig
instid
of
the
baby
that
was
burned
so
this
bleak
morning
in
december
she
pinned
the
around
the
children
and
made
them
sit
up
close
to
the
stove
while
she
pasted
brown
paper
over
the
broken
and
made
sprightly
comments
on
the
change
in
the
weather
the
wiggses
lived
in
the
cabbage
patch
it
was
not
a
real
cabbage
patch
but
a
queer
neighborhood
where
ramshackle
cottages
played
over
the
railroad
tracks
there
were
no
streets
so
when
a
new
house
was
built
the
owner
faced
it
any
way
his
fancy
prompted
bagby
grocery
it
is
true
conformed
to
convention
and
presented
a
solid
front
to
the
railroad
track
but
miss
cottage
shied
off
sidewise
into
the
wiggses
yard
as
if
it
were
afraid
of
the
big
that
went
thundering
past
so
many
times
a
day
and
schultz
front
room
looked
directly
into
the
eichorns
kitchen
the
latter
was
not
a
bad
arrangement
however
for
schultz
had
been
confined
to
her
bed
for
ten
years
and
her
sole
interest
in
life
consisted
in
watching
what
took
place
in
her
neighbor
family
the
wiggses
house
was
the
most
imposing
in
the
neighborhood
this
was
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
it
had
two
front
doors
and
a
tin
roof
one
door
was
nailed
up
and
the
other
opened
outdoors
but
you
would
never
guess
it
from
the
street
when
the
country
house
burned
one
door
had
been
saved
so
wiggs
and
the
boys
brought
it
to
the
new
home
and
skilfully
placed
it
at
the
front
end
of
the
side
porch
but
the
roof
gave
the
house
its
chief
distinction
it
was
the
only
tin
roof
in
the
cabbage
patch
jim
and
billy
had
made
it
of
old
cans
which
they
picked
up
on
the
commons
jim
was
fifteen
and
head
of
the
family
his
shoulders
were
those
of
a
man
and
were
bent
with
work
but
his
body
dwindled
away
to
a
pair
of
thin
legs
that
seemed
incapable
of
supporting
the
burden
imposed
upon
them
in
his
anxious
eyes
was
the
look
of
a
who
had
begun
the
struggle
too
soon
life
had
been
a
tragedy
to
jim
the
tragedy
that
comes
when
a
child
sensitive
soul
is
forced
to
meet
the
responsibilities
of
manhood
yet
lacks
the
wisdom
that
only
experience
can
bring
billy
wiggs
was
differently
constituted
responsibilities
rested
upon
him
as
lightly
as
the
freckles
on
his
nose
when
occasion
or
his
mother
demanded
he
worked
to
good
purposes
with
a
tenacity
that
argued
well
for
his
future
success
but
for
the
most
part
he
played
and
fought
and
got
into
trouble
with
the
aptitude
characteristic
of
the
average
small
boy
it
was
wiggs
boast
that
her
three
little
girls
had
geography
names
first
came
asia
then
australia
when
the
last
baby
arrived
billy
had
stood
looking
down
at
the
small
bundle
and
asked
anxiously
are
you
goin
to
have
it
fer
a
boy
or
a
girl
ma
wiggs
had
answered
a
girl
billy
an

kitchen

and
otherwise

occupied
the
boys
sat
in
the
windows
and
on
the
table
and
the
girls
squeezed
together
on
the
improvised
benches
wiggs
stood
before
them
with
a
dilapidated
in
her
hand
now
you
all
must
hush
talking
so
we

a
hymn

many
blessin
name
one
by
one
an
it
will
surprise
you
what
the
lord
hath
done
clear
and
strong
rose
the
childish
voices
in
different
keys
and
regardless
of
time
but
with
a
genuine
enthusiasm
that
was
in
itself
a
blessing
when
they
had
sung
through
the
three
stanzas
wiggs
began
the
lesson
what
did
we
study
last
sunday
she
asked
no
response
save
a
smothered
giggle
from
two
of
the
little
girls
do
you
all
remember
what
the
lord
give
moses
up
on
the
mountain
a
hand
went
up
in
the
corner
and
an
eager
voice
cried
yas
i
know
lord
give
moses
ten
tallers
an
he
duveled
before
wiggs
could
enter
into
an
argument
concerning
this
new
version
of
sacred
history
she
was
hit
in
the
eye
with
a
paper
wad
it
was
aimed
at
billy
but
when
he
dodged
she
became
the
victim
this
caused
some
delay
for
she
had
to
bathe
the
injured
member
and
during
the
interval
the
became
riotous
mith
wiggs
make
tommy
thop
thpittin
terbaccer
juice
in
my
hat
miss
wiggs
i
know
who
hit
you
teacher
kin
i
git
a
drink
it
was
not
until
wiggs
with
a
stocking
tied
over
her
eye
emerged
from
the
bedroom
and
again
took
command
that
order
was
restored
where
is
bethlehem
she
began
reading
from
an
old
you
kin
search
me
promptly
answered
chris
she
ignored
his
remark
and
passed
to
the
next
who
said
half
doubtfully
ai
it
in
alabama
no
it
in
the
holy
land
she
said
a
sudden
commotion
arose
in
the
back
of
the
room
billy
by
a
series
of
skilful
manoeuvers
had
succeeded
in
removing
the
chair
that
held
one
of
the
planks
and
a
cascade
of
small
indignant
girls
were
tobogganing
sidewise
down
the
incline
a
fight
was
imminent
but
before
any
further
trouble
occurred
wiggs
locked
billy
in
the
bedroom
and
became
mistress
of
the
situation
what
i
think
you
childern
need
is
a
talk
about
fussin
fightin
there
ai
no
use
in
me
teachin
what
they
done
a
thousand
years
ago
when
you
ai
got
manners
enough
to
listen
at
what
i
am
sayin
i
recollect
one
time
durin
the
war
when
the
soldiers
was
layin
the
camp
tryin
they
best
to
keep
from
freezin
to
death
a
preacher
come
to
hold
a
service
an
when
he
got
up
to
preach
he
sez
sez
he
tex
is
chillblains
they
ai
no
use
religion
to
men
whose
whole
thought

set
on
their
feet
now

want
you
all
to
remember
do

came
the
prompt
answer
that
right
now
we
sing
fer
the
shore
when
the
windows
had
ceased
to
rattle
from
the
vibrations
of
the
lusty
chorus
wiggs
lifted
her
hands
for
silence
o
lord
she
prayed
earnestly
help
these
here
childern
to
be
good
an
kind
to
each
other
an
to
their
mas
an
their
pas

thankful

little
show

how
to
live
like
you
want
us
to
live
an
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessin
flow
amen
as
the
last
youngster
scampered
out
of
the
yard
wiggs
turned
to
the
window
where
jim
was
standing
he
had
taken
no
part
in
the
singing
and
was
silent
and
preoccupied
jim
said
his
mother
trying
to
look
into
his
face
you
never
had
on
yer
overcoat
when
you
come
in
you
ai
gone
an
sold
it
yes
said
the
boy
heavily
but
ai
fer
the
rent
i
got
to
figger
it
out
some
other
way
wiggs
put
her
arm
about
his
shoulder
and
together
they
looked
out
across
the
dreary
commons
do
you
worry
so
jimmy
said
she
mebbe
i
kin
git
work
or
you
git
a
raise
or
somethin
they
be
some
way
little
she
guessed
what
the
way
was
to
be
chapter
ii
ways
and
means
ah
well
may
the
children
weep
before
you
they
are
weary
ere
they
run
they
have
never
seen
the
sunshine
nor
the
glory
which
is
brighter
than
the
sun
the
cold
wave
that
was
ushered
in
that
december
morning
was
the
beginning
of
a
long
series
of
days
that
vied
with
each
other
as
to
which
could
induce
the
mercury
to
drop
the
lowest
the
descent
of
the
temperature
seemed
to
have
a
like
effect
on
the
barrel
of
potatoes
and
the
load
of
coal
in
the
wiggses
parlor
wiggs
untiring
efforts
to
find
employment
had
met
with
no
success
and
jim
exertions
were
redoubled
day
by
day
his
scanty
earnings
became
less
sufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
family
on
christmas
eve
they
sat
over
the
stove
after
the
little
ones
had
gone
to
bed
and
discussed
the
situation
the
wind
hurled
itself
against
the
house
in
a
very
frenzy
of
rage
shaking
the
icicles
from
the
and
hissing
through
the
patched
panes
the
snow
that
sifted
in
through
the
loose
sash
lay
unmelted
on
the
sill
jim
had
a
piece
of
old
carpet
about
him
and
coughed
with
almost
every
breath
wiggs
head
was
in
her
hands
and
the
tears
that
trickled
through
her
crooked
fingers
hissed
as
they
fell
on
the
stove
it
was
the
first
time
jim
had
ever
seen
her
give
up
seems
like
we
have
to
ast
fer
help
jim
she
said
i
ast
fer
credit
at
bagby
seems
like
i
never
have
the
courage
to
pull
agin
a
debt
what
do
you
think
i
guess
it
looks
like
mebbe
we
have
to
apply
to
the
organization
jim
eyes
flashed
not
yet
ma
he
said
firmly
it
be
with
us
like
it
was
with
the
hornbys
they
did
have
nothin
to
eat
and
they
went
to
the
organization
ant
the
man
asted
if
they
had
a
bed
or
a
table
an
when
they
said
yes
he
said
why
you
sell
no
ma
as
long
as
we
got
coal
i
git
the
vittles
some
way
he
had
to
pause
for
a
violent
attack
of
coughing
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
i
think
i
can
git
a
night
job
next
week
one
of
the

in
from
the
country
ever

to

but
jimmy
boy
cried
his
mother
her
voice
quivering
with
anxiety
you
never
could
stan
it
night
an
day
too
no
watch
the
wagon
i
a
knock
on
the
parlor
door
interrupted
her
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
and
smoothed
her
hair
jim
went
to
the
door
i
a
christmas
basket
for
you
cried
a
cheery
voice
is
this
christmas
jim
asked
dully
the
girl
in
the
doorway
laughed
she
was
tall
and
slender
but
jim
could
only
see
a
pair
of
sparkling
eyes
between
the
brim
of
the
hat
and
her
high
fur
collar
it
was
nice
to
hear
her
laugh
though
it
made
things
seem
warmer
somehow
the
colored
man
behind
her
deposited
a
large
basket
on
the
doorstep
it
from
the
church
she
explained
a
crowd
of
us
are
out
in
the
omnibus
distributing
baskets
well
how
you
ever
happen
to
come
here
cried
wiggs
who
had
come
to
the
door
there
is
one
for
each
of
the
families
just
a
little
christmas
greeting
you
know
wiggs
spirits
were
rising
every
minute
well
that
certainly
is
kind
an
thoughtful
like
she
said
wo
you
she
hesitated
the
room
she
had
just
left
was
not
in
a
condition
to
receive
guests
but
wiggs
was
a
kentuckian
come
right
in
an
git
warm
she
said
cordially
the
stove
died
down
some
but
you
could
git
thawed
out
no
thank
you
i
ca
come
in
said
the
young
lady
with
a
side
glance
at
jim
who
was
leaning
against
the
door
have
you
plenty
of
coal
she
asked
in
an
undertone
oh
yes
thank
you
said
wiggs
smiling
reassuringly
her
tone
might
have
been
less
confident
but
for
jim
warning
glance
every
fiber
of
his
sensitive
nature
shrank
from
asking
help
the
girl
was
puzzled
she
noticed
the
stamp
of
poverty
on
everything
in
sight
except
the
bright
face
of
the
little
woman
before
her
well
she
said
doubtfully
if
you
ever
want
to
come
to
see
me
ask
for
miss
lucy
olcott
at
terrace
park
good
night
and
a
happy
christmas
she
was
gone
and
the
doorway
looked
very
black
and
lonesome
in
consequence
but
there
was
the
big
basket
to
prove
she
was
not
merely
an
apparition
and
it
took
both
jim
and
his
mother
to
carry
it
in
sitting
on
the
floor
they
unpacked
it
there
were
vegetables
oatmeal
fruit
and
even
tea
and
coffee
but
the
surprise
was
at
the
very
bottom
a
big
turkey
looking
so
comical
with
his
legs
stuck
in
his
body
that
jim
laughed
outright
it
the
first
turkey
that
been
in
this
house
fer
many
a
day
said
wiggs
delightedly
as
she
pinched
the
fat
fowl
i
europena

skeered
of
it
it
so
big
my
but
we
have
a
good
dinner

plate
over
to
schultz

a
little
o
this
here
tea
to
ole
mrs
lawson
the
cloud
had
turned
inside
out
for
wiggs
and
only
the
silver
lining
was
visible
jim
was
doing
a
sum
on
the
brown
paper
that
came
over
the
basket
and
presently
he
looked
up
and
said
slowly
ma
i
guess
we
ca
have
the
turkey
this
year
i
kin
sell
it
fer
a
dollar
and
that
would
buy
us
fer
a
good
while
wiggs
face
fell
and
she
twisted
her
in
silence
she
had
pictured
the
joy
of
a
real
christmas
dinner
the
first
the
youngest
children
had
ever
known
she
had
already
thought
of
half
a
dozen
neighbors
to
whom
she
wanted
to
send
a
little
snack
but
one
look
at
jim
anxious
face
recalled
their
circumstances
of
course
we
sell
it
she
said
brightly
you
have
got
the
longest
head
fer
a
boy
we
sell
it
in
the
mornin
an
buy
sausage
fer
dinner
an
i
cook
some
of
these
here
nice
vegetables
an
put
a
orange
an
some
candy
at
each
plate
an
the
childern
never
know
nothin
it
besides
she
added
if
you
ai
never
et
turkey
meat
you
do
know
how
good
it
is
but
in
spite
of
her
philosophy
after
jim
had
gone
to
bed
she
slipped
over
and
took
one
more
look
at
the
turkey
i
think
i
would
minded
so
much
she
said
wistfully
ef
they
had
sent
the
cramberries
too
for
ten
days
the
basket
of
provisions
and
the
extra
money
made
by
jim
night
work
and
wiggs
washing
supplied
the
demands
of
the
family
but
by
the
end
of
january
the
clouds
had
gathered
thicker
than
before
wiggs
heart
was
heavy
one
night
as
she
tramped
home
through
the
snow
after
a
hard
day
work
the
rent
was
due
the
coal
was
out
and
only
a
few
potatoes
were
left
in
the
barrel
but
these
were
mere
shadow
troubles
compared
to
jim
illness
he
had
been
too
sick
to
go
to
the
factory
that
morning
and
she
dared
not
think
what
changes
the
day
may
have
brought
as
she
lifted
the
latch
of
her
rickety
door
the
sobbing
of
a
child
greeted
her
it
was
little
europena
crying
for
food
for
three
days
there
had
been
no
bread
in
the
house
and
a
scanty
supply
of
potatoes
and
beans
had
been
their
only
nourishment
wiggs
hastened
to
where
jim
lay
on
a
cot
in
the
corner
his
cheeks
were
flushed
and
his
thin
nervous
fingers
picked
at
the
old
shawl
that
covered
him
jim
she
said
kneeling
beside
him
and
pressing
his
hot
hand
to
her
cheek
jim
darling
lem
me
go
fer
the
doctor
you
worser
than
you
was
this
mornin
an
an
i
so
skeered
her
voice
broke
in
a
sob
jim
tried
to
put
his
arm
around
her
but
something
hurt
him
in
his
chest
when
he
moved
so
he
patted
her
hand
instead
never
mind
ma
he
said
his
breath
coming
short
we
ai
got
no
money
to
buy
the
medicine
even
if
the
doctor
did
come
you
go
git
some
supper
now
an
ma
do
worry
i
goin
to
take
keer
of
you
all
only
only
he
added
wearily
i
guess
i
ca
sleep
in
the
wagon
slowly
the
hours
passed
until
midnight
wiggs
had
pulled
cot
close
to
the
stove
and
applied
vigorous
measures
to
relieve
him
her
efforts
were
unceasing
and
one
after
another
the
homely
country
remedies
were
faithfully
administered
at
twelve
he
grew
restless
seems
like
i
hot
then
agin
i
cold
he
said
speaking
with
difficulty
could
you
find
a
little
somethin
more
to
put
over
me
ma
wiggs
got
up
and
went
toward
the
bed
the
three
little
girls
lay
huddled
under
one
old
quilt
their
faces
pale
and
sunken
she
turned
away
abruptly
and
looked
toward
the
corner
where
billy
slept
on
a
pallet
the
blankets
on
his
bed
were
insufficient
even
for
him
she
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
for
a
moment
dry
sobs
convulsed
her
the
hardest
grief
is
often
that
which
leaves
no
trace
when
she
went
back
to
the
stove
she
had
a
smile
ready
for
the
sick
boy
here
the
very
thing
she
said
it
my
dress
skirt
i
need
it
a
mite
settin
up
here
so
clost
to
the
fire
see
how
nice
it
tucks
in
all
for
a
while
he
lay
silent
then
he
said
ma
are
you
yes
jim
well
i
bin
thinking
it
over
if
i
ai
better
in
the
morning
i
guess
the
words
came
reluctantly
i
guess
you
better
go
see
the
christmas
lady
i
would
mind
her
knowin
so
much
wo

fer
long
nohow
cause
i
kin
take
keer
of
you
all
soon
soon
i
kin
git
up
the
talking
brought
on
severe
coughing
and
he
sank
back
exhausted
ca
you
go
to
sleep
honey
asked
his
mother
no
it
them
ole
wheels
he
said
fretfully
them
wheels
at
the
when
i
git
to
sleep
they
keep
on
wakin
me
up
wiggs
hands
were
rough
and
knotted
but
love
taught
them
to
be
gentle
as
she
smoothed
his
hot
head
want
me
to
tell
you
the
country
jim
she
asked
since
he
was
a
little
boy
he
had
loved
to
hear
of
their
old
home
in
the
valley
his
dim
recollection
of
it
all
formed
his
one
conception
of
heaven
yes
ma
mebbe
it
will
make
me
fergit
the
wheels
he
said
well
she
began
putting
her
head
beside
his
on
the
pillow
so
he
could
not
watch
her
face
it
was
all
jes
like
a
big
front
yard
without
no
fences
an
the
flowers
did
belong
to
folks
like
they
do
over
on
the
avenue
where
you
dassent
pick
a
one
but
they
was
god
an
you
was
welcome
to
all
you
could
pull
an
there
was
trees
jim
where
you
could
climb
up
an
git
big
red
apples
when
the
frost
come
they
be
persimmons
that
jes
melt
in
yer
mouth
an
you
could
look
off
the
meaders
an
see
the
trees
in
the
sunshine
an
up
over
yer
head
the
birds
be
singin
like
they
was
never
goin
to
stop
an
yer
pa
an
me
take
you
out
at
the
harvestin
time
an
you
play
on
the
i
kin
remember
jes
how
you
looked
jim
a
fat
little
boy
with
red
cheeks
all
the
time
wiggs
could
tell
no
more
for
the
old
memories
were
too
much
for
her
jim
scarcely
knew
when
she
stopped
his
eyes
were
half
closed
and
a
sweet
drowsiness
was
upon
him
it
nice
an
warm
in
the
sunshine
he
murmured
the
meaders
trees
laughin
all
the
time
birds
singin
singin
singin
then
jim
began
to
sing
too
softly
and
monotonously
and
the
sorrow
that
had
not
come
with
years
left
his
tired
face
and
he
fearlessly
drifted
away
into
the
shadowy
valley
where
his
lost
childhood
lay
chapter
iii
the
christmas
lady
the
rosy
glow
of
summer
is
on
thy
dimpled
cheek
while
in
thy
heart
the
winter
is
lying
cold
and
bleak
but
this
shall
change
hereafter
when
years
have
done
their
part
and
on
thy
cheek
the
wintered
and
summer
in
thy
heart
late
the
next
afternoon
a
man
and
a
girl
were
standing
in
the
olcott
reception
hall
the
lamps
had
not
been
lighted
but
the
blaze
from
the
threw
a
cozy
glow
of
comfort
over
the
crimson
curtains
and
on
the
mass
of
pillows
in
the
robert
redding
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
would
have
been
gone
long
ago
if
the
christmas
lady
had
not
worn
her
violet
gown
he
said
it
always
took
him
half
an
hour
to
say
when
she
wore
a
rose
in
her
hair
and
a
full
hour
when
she
had
on
the
violet
dress
by
jove
stand
there
a
minute
just
as
you
are
the
shining
through
your
hair
makes
you
look
like
a
saint
little
saint
lucinda
he
said
teasingly
as
he
tried
to
catch
her
hand
she
put
it
behind
her
for
not
a
saint
at
all
he
went
on
in
mock
surprise
then
an
iceberg
a
nice
proper
little
iceberg
lucy
olcott
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
he
was
very
tall
and
straight
and
his
face
retained
much
of
its
boyishness
in
spite
of
the
firm
square
jaw
robert
she
said
suddenly
grown
serious
i
wish
you
would
do
something
for
me
all
right
what
is
it
he
asked
she
timidly
put
her
hand
on
his
and
looked
up
at
him
earnestly
it
about
dick
harris
she
said
i
wish
you
would
not
be
with
him
so
much
redding
face
clouded
you
are
afraid
to
trust
me
he
asked
oh
no
it
is
that
she
said
hurriedly
but
robert
it
makes
people
think
such
wrong
things
about
you
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
misjudged
redding
put
his
arm
around
her
and
together
they
stood
looking
down
into
the
glowing
embers
tell
me
about
it
little
girl
what
have
you
heard
he
asked
she
hesitated
it
was
true
what
they
said
i
knew
it
true
but
they
had
no
right
to
say
it
well
let
hear
it
anyway
what
was
it
some
people
were
here
last
night
from
new
orleans
they
asked
if
i
knew
you
said
they
knew
you
and
dick
the
year
you
spent
there
well
said
redding
lucy
evidently
found
it
difficult
to
continue
they
said
some
horrid
things
then
just
because
you
were
dick
friend
what
were
they
lucy
they
told
me
that
you
were
both
as
wild
as
could
be
that
your
reputation
was
no
better
than
his
that
forgive
me
robert
for
even
repeating
it
it
made
me
very
angry
and
i
told
them
it
was
not
true
not
a
word
of
it
that
it
was
all
dick
fault
that
he
lucy
interrupted
redding
peremptorily
wait
until
you
hear
me
i
have
never
lied
to
you
about
anything
and
i
will
not
stoop
to
it
now
four
years
ago
when
those
people
knew
me
i
was
just
what
they
said
dick
harris
and
i
went
to
new
orleans
straight
from
college
neither
of
us
had
a
home
or
people
to
care
about
us
so
we
went
in
for
a
good
time
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
was
sick
of
it
all
braced
up
and
came
here
poor
dick
he
kept
on
at
his
first
words
the
color
had
left
lucy
face
and
she
had
slipped
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
and
stood
watching
him
with
horrified
eyes
but
you
were
never
like
dick
she
protested
yes
he
continued
passionately
and
but
for
god
help
i
should
be
like
him
still
it
was
an
awful
pull
and
heaven
only
knows
how
i
struggled
i
never
quite
saw
the
use
of
it
all
until
i
met
you
six
months
ago
then
i
realized
that
the
past
four
years
had
been
given
me
in
which
to
make
a
man
of
myself
as
he
finished
speaking
he
saw
for
the
first
time
that
lucy
was
crying
he
sprang
forward
but
she
shrank
away
no
no
do
touch
me
i
so
terribly
disappointed
and
hurt
and
stunned
but
you
surely
do
love
me
the
less
for
having
conquered
these
things
in
the
past
i
do
know
i
do
know
she
said
with
a
sob
i
honored
and
idealized
you
robert
i
can
never
think
of
you
as
being
other
than
you
are
now
but
why
should
you
he
pleaded
it
was
only
one
year
out
of
my
life
too
much
it
true
but
i
have
atoned
for
it
with
all
my
might
the
intensity
and
earnestness
of
his
voice
were
beginning
to
influence
her
she
was
very
young
with
the
stern
uncompromising
standards
of
girlhood
life
was
black
or
white
to
her
and
time
had
not
yet
filled
in
the
canvas
with
the
myriad
grays
that
blend
into
one
another
until
all
lines
are
effaced
and
only
the
master
artist
knows
the
boundaries
she
looked
up
through
her
tears
i
try
to
forgive
you
she
said
tremulously
but
you
must
promise
to
give
up
your
friendship
for
dick
harris
redding
frowned
and
bit
his
lip
that
not
fair
he
said
you
know
dick
my
chum
that
he
has
the
least
influence
over
me
that
i
am
about
the
only
one
to
stand
by
him
i
am
not
afraid
of
his
influence
but
i
do
want
people
to
see
you
together
it
makes
them
say
things
but
lucy
you
would
have
me
go
back
on
him
dick
has
a
big
heart
he
trying
to
brace
up
oh
nonsense
cried
lucy
impatiently
the
fire
in
her
eyes
had
dried
the
tears
he
could
straighten
up
if
he
wanted
to
he
likes
to
drink
and
gamble
so
he
does
it
and
you
keep
him
in
countenance
by
your
friendship
are
you
hesitating
between
us
she
demanded
angrily
redding
face
was
clouded
and
he
spoke
slowly
you
would
ask
this
of
me
lucy
if
you
understood
dick
and
i
have
been
chums
since
we
were
boys
he
came
to
kentucky
three
months
ago
sick
and
miserable
one
day
he
came
into
the
office
and
said
you
pulled
through
all
right
do
you
think
it
too
late
for
me
to
try
what
would
you
have
said
what
you
did
probably
answered
lucy
but
i
would
have
profited
by
the
one
experience
for
he
has
hardly
drawn
a
sober
breath
since
she
looked
out
of
the
window
across
the
snowy
landscape
and
in
her
face
was
something
of
the
passionless
purity
of
the
scene
upon
which
her
eyes
rested
you
are
mistaken
he
cried
fiercely
because
you
have
seen
him
several
times
in
that
condition
you
have
no
right
to
draw
such
a
conclusion
he
is
weak
nobody
denies
it
but
what
can
you
know
of
the
struggle
he
makes
of
his
eagerness
to
do
better
of
the
fight
that
he
is
constantly
making
with
himself
his
words
fell
on
deaf
ears
then
you
choose
mr
harris
lucy
this
is
madness
it
is
not
like
you
in
the
least
the
girl
was
cold
with
anger
and
excitement
it
is
bad
enough
she
said
to
know
that
my
defense
of
you
last
night
was
worse
than
useless
but
to
have
you
persist
in
a
friendship
with
a
man
who
is
beneath
you
in
every
way
is
more
than
i
can
stand
she
slipped
a
ring
from
her
finger
and
held
it
toward
him
i
could
never
marry
a
man
of
whom
i
was
ashamed
the
shot
went
home
there
was
a
white
line
about
redding
mouth
as
he
turned
away
i
would
not
ask
you
to
he
said
with
simple
dignity
as
he
opened
the
door
please
is
this
miss
olcott
asked
a
trembling
voice
on
the
piazza
a
shabby
woman
stood
looking
at
them
with
wild
eyes
her
gray
hair
had
escaped
from
the
torn
shawl
that
was
pinned
over
her
head
and
stray
locks
blew
across
her
face
lucy
did
not
recognize
her
i
will
speak
to
you
in
a
moment
she
said
an
awkward
pause
followed
each
waiting
for
the
other
to
speak
i
will
come
when
you
send
for
me
said
redding
without
looking
at
her
and
turning
abruptly
he
strode
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
dusk
lucy
caught
her
breath
and
started
forward
then
she
remembered
the
woman
what
is
it
she
asked
listlessly
the
woman
stepped
forward
and
put
out
a
hand
to
steady
herself
against
the
door
her
face
was
distorted
and
her
voice
came
in
gasps
you
said
i
was
to
come
if
i
needed
you
it
jimmy
dead
it
may
be
experience
of
suffering
makes
one
especially
tender
to
the
of
others
at
any
rate
the
article
that
lucy
olcott
wrote
for
the
paper
that
night
held
the
one
touch
of
nature
that
makes
the
whole
world
kin
she
had
taken
aunt
chloe
the
old
colored
servant
and
gone
home
with
wiggs
relieving
as
far
as
possible
the
immediate
need
of
the
family
then
she
had
come
home
and
written
their
story
telling
it
simply
but
with
the
passionate
earnestness
of
one
who
for
the
first
time
has
come
into
contact
with
poverty
and
starvation
she
told
of
the
plucky
struggle
made
by
the
boy
of
his
indomitable
courage
of
his
final
defeat
and
she
ended
by
asking
help
of
any
kind
for
the
destitute
family
a
week
later
she
sat
at
her
desk
bewildered
her
article
written
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
with
the
one
thought
of
making
people
understand
had
fulfilled
its
mission
for
seven
days
she
had
done
nothing
but
answer
questions
and
notes
and
receive
contributions
for
the
wiggs
family
money
had
arrived
from
all
over
the
state
and
from
every
class
of
society
eichenstine
sent
fifty
dollars
and
six
ragged
newsboys
came
to
present
thirty
cents
a
lavender
note
with
huge
monogram
and
written
in
white
ink
stated
that
some
of
the
girls
of
the
gay
burlesque
troupe
sent
a
few
dimes
to
the
kid
mother
the
few
dimes
amounted
to
fifteen
dollars
van
larkin
coachman
had
to
wait
with
her
note
while
lucy
answered
the
questions
of
a
lame
old
negro
who
had
brought
a
quarter
maria
done
tole
me
what
was
writ
in
de
papah
dat
pore
chile
he
was
saying
i
sutenly
do
feel
sorry
fer
he
maw
i
ai
got
much
but
i
tole
maria
i
guess
we
could
do
without
somethin
to
gib
a
quahter
so
it
continued
old
and
young
rich
and
poor
paid
their
substantial
tribute
of
respect
to
jimmy
wiggs
lucy
counted
up
the
long
line
of
figures
three
hundred
and
dollars
she
exclaimed
and
food
clothes
and
coal
enough
to
last
them
a
year
it
was
like
a
direct
answer
to
her
prayer
and
yet
this
poor
little
suppliant
instead
of
being
duly
exalted
put
her
head
on
the
desk
and
wept
bitterly
now
that
the
need
of
the
wiggs
family
had
been
met
another
appeal
silent
and
potent
was
troubling
her
heart
redding
had
neither
come
nor
written
and
she
was
beginning
to
realize
the
seriousness
of
their
misunderstanding
chapter
iv
the
annexation
of
cuby
they
well
deserve
to
have
that
know
the
strongest
and
surest
way
to
get
almost
a
year
rolled
over
the
cabbage
patch
and
it
was
nearing
christmas
again
the
void
left
in
wiggs
heart
by
jim
death
could
never
be
filled
but
time
was
beginning
to
soften
her
grief
and
the
necessity
for
steady
employment
kept
her
from
brooding
over
her
trouble
it
was
still
needful
to
maintain
the
strictest
economy
for
half
the
money
which
had
been
given
them
was
in
miss
olcott
keeping
as
a
safeguard
against
another
rainy
day
wiggs
had
got
as
much
washing
as
she
could
do
asia
helped
about
the
house
and
billy
did
odd
jobs
wherever
he
could
find
them
the
direct
road
to
fortune
however
according
to
billy
ideas
could
best
be
traveled
in
a
and
while
he
was
the
proud
possessor
of
a
dilapidated
wagon
sole
relic
of
the
late
wiggs
he
had
nothing
to
hitch
to
it
scarcely
a
week
passed
that
he
did
not
agitate
the
question
and
as
wiggs
often
said
when
billy
wiggs
done
set
his
head
to
a
thing
he
as
good
as
got
it
so
she
was
not
surprised
when
he
rushed
breathlessly
into
the
kitchen
one
evening
about
and
exclaimed
in
excited
tones
ma
i
got
a
horse
he
was
havin
a
fit

the
commons
an
they

goin
to

carcass
but
i
said
right

come
on
ma
an
see
him
and
billy
hurried
back
to
his
new
possession
wiggs
pinned
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
ran
across
the
commons
a
group
of
men
stood
around
the
writhing
animal
but
the
late
owner
had
departed
he
gone
said
one
of
the
men
as
she
came
up
i
tole
billy

nag

two
dollars
dead
an
mebbe

living
anyway
i
goin
to
save
him
if
there
any
save
to
him
she
stood
with
her
arms
on
her
hips
and
critically
surveyed
her
patient
i
tell
you
what
the
matter
with
him
was
her
final
diagnosis
his
lights
is
riz
billy
i
goin
home
fer
some
medicine
you
set
on
his
head
so
he
ca
git
up
an
ma
be
right
back
in
a
minute
the
crowd
which
had
collected
to
see
the
horse
shot
began
to
disperse
for
it
was
and
there
was
nothing
to
see
now
but
the
poor
suffering
animal
with
billy
wiggs
patiently
sitting
on
its
head
when
wiggs
returned
she
carried
a
bottle
and
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
marble
this
here
is
a
calomel
pill
she
explained
i
jes
rolled
the
calomel
in
with
some
soft
light
bread
now
you
prop
his
jaw
open
with
a
little
stick
an
i
shove
it
in
then
hole
his
head
back
while
i
pour
down
some
water
an
turkentine
outen
this
bottle
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
this
was
accomplished
for
the
old
horse
had
evidently
seen
a
vision
of
the
happy
and
was
loath
to
return
to
the
sordid
earth
his
limbs
were
already
stiffening
in
death
and
the
whites
of
his
eyes
only
were
visible
wiggs
noted
these
discouraging
symptoms
and
saw
that
violent
measures
were
necessary
gether
some
sticks
an
build
a
fire
quick
as
you
kin
i
got
to
run
over
home
build
it
right
up
clost
to
him
billy
we
got
to
git
him
het
up
she
rushed
into
the
kitchen
and
taking
several
cakes
of
tallow
from
the
shelf
threw
them
into
a
tin
bucket
then
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
the
kettle
of
soup
was
steaming
away
on
the
stove
ready
for
supper
wiggs
did
not
believe
in
sacrificing
the
present
need
to
the
future
comfort
she
threw
in
a
liberal
portion
of
pepper
and
seizing
the
kettle
in
one
hand
and
the
bucket
of
tallow
in
the
other
staggered
back
to
the
bonfire
now
billy
she
commanded
put
this
bucket
of
tallow
down
there
in
the
hottest
part
of
the
fire
look
out
do
tip
it
there
now
you
come
here
an
help
me
pour
this
soup
into
the
bottle
goin
to
git
that
ole
hoss
so
het
up
he
think
he
havin
a
sunstroke
seems
sorter
bad
to
keep
on
pestering
him
when
he
so
near
gone
but
this
here
soup
feel
good
when
it
once
gits
inside
him
when
the
kettle
was
empty
the
soup
was
impartially
distributed
over
wiggs
and
the
patient
but
a
goodly
amount
had
got
inside
and
already
the
horse
was
losing
his
rigidity
only
once
did
billy
pause
in
his
work
and
that
was
to
ask
ma
what
do
you
think
i
better
name
him
giving
names
was
one
of
wiggs
chief
accomplishments
and
usually
required
much
thoughtful
consideration
but
in
this
case
if
there
was
to
be
a
christening
it
must
be
at
once
i
like
a
jography
name
suggested
billy
feeling
that
nothing
was
too
good
to
bestow
upon
his
treasure
wiggs
stood
with
the
soup
dripping
from
her
hands
and
earnestly
contemplated
the
horse
babies
pigs
goats
and
puppies
had
drawn
largely
on
her
supply
of
late
and
geography
names
especially
were
scarce
suddenly
a
thought
struck
her
i
tell
you
what
billy
we
call
him
cuby
it
a
town
i
heared
talkin
at
the
grocery
by
this
time
the
tallow
was
melted
and
wiggs
carried
it
over
by
the
horse
and
put
each
of
his
hoofs
into
the
hot
liquid
while
billy
rubbed
the
legs
with
all
the
strength
of
his
young
arms
that
right
she
said
now
you
run
home
an
git
that
piece
of
carpet
by
my
bed
an
we
kiver
him
up
i
am
goin
to
git
them
fence
rails
over
yonder
to
keep
the
fire
goin
through
the
long
night
they
worked
with
their
patient
and
when
the
first
glow
of
morning
appeared
in
the
east
a
triumphant
procession
wended
its
way
across
the
cabbage
patch
first
came
an
old
woman
bearing
sundry
pails
kettles
and
bottles
next
came
a
very
sleepy
little
boy
leading
a
trembling
old
horse
with
soup
all
over
its
head
tallow
on
its
feet
and
a
strip
of
tied
about
its
middle
and
thus
cuba
like
his
geographical
namesake
emerged
from
the
violent
ordeal
of
reconstruction
with
a
mangled
constitution
internal
dissension
a
decided
preponderance
of
foreign
element
but
a
firm
and
abiding
trust
in
the
new
power
with
which
his
fortunes
had
been
irrevocably
cast
chapter
v
a
reminiscence
it
is
easy
enough
to
be
pleasant
when
life
flows
along
like
a
song
but
the
man
worth
while
is
the
one
who
will
smile
when
everything
goes
dead
wrong
when
miss
hazy
was
awakened
early
that
morning
by
a
resonant
neigh
at
the
head
of
her
bed
she
mistook
it
for
the
trump
of
doom
miss
hazy
cottage
as
has
been
said
was
built
on
the
bias
in
the
wiggses
side
yard
and
the
little
immediately
behind
miss
hazy
bedroom
had
been
pressed
into
service
as
cuba
temporary
after
her
first
agonized
fright
the
old
woman
ventured
to
push
the
door
open
a
crack
and
peep
out
chris
she
said
in
a
tense
whisper
to
her
sleeping
nephew
chris
what
on
airth
is
this
here
hitched
to
our
shutter
chris
usually
deaf
to
all
calls
less
emphatic
than
cold
water
and
a
broomstick
raised
a
rumpled
head
from
the
where
at
he
asked
right
here
said
miss
hazy
still
in
a
terrified
whisper
and
holding
fast
the
door
as
if
the
specter
might
attempt
an
entrance
chris
did
not
stop
to
adjust
his
wooden
leg
but
hopped
over
to
the
door
and
cautiously
put
an
eye
to
the
opening
why
shucks
ai
nothin
but
a
hoss
he
said
in
disgust
having
nerved
himself
for
nothing
less
than
a
rhinoceros
such
as
he
had
seen
in
the
circus
how
he
git
there
demanded
miss
hazy
chris
was
not
prepared
to
say
all
through
breakfast
miss
hazy
was
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
she
had
once
heard
of
a
baby
being
left
on
a
doorstep
but
never
a
horse
when
the
limit
of
her
curiosity
was
about
reached
she
saw
wiggs
coming
across
the
yard
carrying
a
bucket
she
hastened
to
meet
her
mornin
called
wiggs
brightly
in
spite
of
her
vigil
ai
we
got
a
fine
hoss
miss
hazy
put
the
between
herself
and
the
animal
and
hazarded
a
timid
inspection
while
wiggs
made
explanations
and
called
attention
to
cuba
fine
points
ca
you
come
in
an
take
a
warm
asked
miss
hazy
as
she
concluded
well

over
fer
quite
a
spell

childern
kin
clean
up
bein

saturday
from
seven
to
nine
in
the
morning
were
the
favorite
in
the
cabbage
patch
wiggs
chose
the
chair
which
had
the
least
on
it
and
leaned
back
smiling
affably
as
she
remarked
we
used
to
hosses
this
here
the
second
one
we
had
my
said
miss
hazy
you
muster
been
well
to

you
how
jim

our
other
hoss
to

heard
the
story
a
number
of
times
but
she
knew
the
duties
of
a
hostess
it
was
this
went
on
wiggs
drawing
her
chair
closer
to
the
fire
and
preparing
for
a
good
long
talk
you
see
me
an
the
childern

poor
jim
always
ready

she
paused
to
wipe
her
eyes
on
her
apron
and
miss
hazy
wept
in
sympathy
never
min
miss
wiggs
do
cry

wiggs
swallowing

with
a
cordial
wiggs
went
cheerfully
away
to
administer
chastisement
to
her
erring
offspring
chapter
vi
a
theater
party
the
play
the
play
the
thing
billy
foreign
policy
proved
most
satisfactory
and
after
the
annexation
of
cuba
many
additional
dimes
found
their
way
into
the
tin
box
on
top
of
the
wardrobe
but
it
took
them
all
besides
wiggs
earnings
to
keep
the
family
from
the
awful
calamity
of
pulling
agin
a
debt
one
cold
december
day
billy
came
in
and
found
his
mother
leaning
wearily
on
the
table
her
face
brightened
as
he
entered
but
he
caught
the
tired
look
in
her
eyes
what
the
matter
he
asked
ai
nothin
the
matter
billy
she
said
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
i
jes
wore
out
that
all
it
be
with
me
like
it
was
with
uncle
ned
ole
ox
i
reckon
he
kep
till
he
died
up
an
even
then
they
had
to
push
him
over
she
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
gazing
absently
across
the
commons
do
you
know
billy
she
said
suddenly
i
got
the
craziest
notion
in
my
head
i
jes
give
anythin
to
see
the
show
at
the
opery
house
this
week
if
she
had
expressed
a
wish
for
a
diamond
necklace
billy
could
not
have
been
more
amazed
and
his
countenance
expressed
his
state
of
mind
wiggs
hastened
to
explain
course
i
ai
really
thinkin
goin
but
them
started
me
to
studyin
about
it
an
i
got
to
wishin
me
an
you
could
go
i
do
it
much
when
you
git
inside
said
billy
trying
the
effects
of
negative
consolation
yes
is
billy
wiggs
answered
his
mother
impressively
you
ai
never
been
inside
a
theayter
an
i
have
i
was
there
twict
an
it
was
grand
you
orter
see
the
lights
an
fixin
an
all
the
fine
ladies
an
their
beaus
first
time
i
went
they
was
a
man
in
on
a
rope
up
over
head
what
asked
billy
thrilled
in
spite
of
himself
it
spangles
yer
waist
an
shoes
without
no
heels
to
you
see
the
man
could
wear
many
clothes
it
would
make
him
too
heavy
to
stay
up
there
in
the
air
the
band
plays
all
the
time
an
folks
sing
an
speechify
an
laughs
an
has
a
good
time
it
jes
grand
i
tell
you
billy
brows
were
puckered
and
he
sat
unusually
quiet
for
a
while
looking
at
his
mother
finally
he
said
you
might
take
my
from
las
week
wiggs
was
indignant
why
billy
wiggs
she
exclaimed
do
you
think
i
take
an
go
to
a
show
when
asia
an
australia
ai
got
a
good
shoe
to
their
backs
billy
said
no
more
about
the
theater
but
that
afternoon
when
he
was
out
with
the
kindling
he
pondered
the
matter
deeply
it
was
quite
cold
and
sometimes
he
had
to
put
the
reins
between
his
knees
and
shove
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
to
get
the
stiffness
out
of
them
it
really
seemed
as
if
everybody
had
just
laid
in
a
supply
of
kindling
and
the
shadowy
little
plan
he
had
been
forming
was
growing
more
shadowy
all
the
time
i
the
tickets
cost
a
heap
he
thought
ruefully
as
he
drew
himself
up
into
a
regular
pretzel
of
a
boy
but
then
she
never
does
have
no
fun
an
never
gits
a
thing
fer
herself
and
because
billy
knew
of
his
mother
many
sacrifices
and
because
he
found
it
very
hard
to
take
jim
place
a
lump
lodged
in
his
throat
and
gave
him
so
much
trouble
that
he
forgot
for
a
while
how
cold
he
was
about
this
time
he
came
within
sight
of
the
opera
house
and
tantalizing
posters
appeared
of
the
greatest
extravaganza
of
the
century
he
pulled
cuba
into
a
walk
and
sat
there
absorbing
the
wonders
depicted
among
the
marvels
were
crowds
of
children
dressed
as
butterflies
beautiful
ladies
marching
in
line
a
man
balancing
a
barrel
on
his
feet
and
yes
there
was
the
man
in
walking
on
the
rope
a
keen
puff
of
wind
brought
billy
back
to
his
senses
and
as
his
longing
eyes
turned
from
the
gorgeous
they
encountered
the
amused
look
of
a
gentleman
who
had
just
come
out
from
the
opera
house
he
was
so
tall
and
that
billy
thought
he
must
own
the
show
some
kindlin
sir
the
gentleman
shook
his
head
the
posters
still
danced
before
billy
eyes
if
his
mother
could
only
see
the
show
the
last
chance
seemed
slipping
away
suddenly
a
bold
idea
presented
itself
he
got
out
of
the
wagon
and
came
up
on
the
step
could
you
use
a
whole
load
if
i
was
to
take
it
out
in
tickets
the
man
looked
puzzled
take
it
out
in
tickets
he
repeated
yes
sir
said
billy
theayter
tickets
do
you
own
the
show
the
gentleman
laughed
well
hardly
he
said
what
do
you
want
with
more
than
one
ticket
there
was
a
certain
sympathy
in
his
voice
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
still
laughing
and
before
billy
knew
it
he
had
told
him
all
about
it
how
many
tickets
could
yer
gim
me
fer
the
load
he
asked
in
conclusion
the
gentleman
made
a
hurried
calculation
you
say
you
have
three
sisters
he
asked
yep
said
billy
well
i
should
say
that
load
was
worth
about
five
tickets
gee
whiz
cried
the
boy
that
take
us
all
he
followed
the
gentleman
back
to
the
and
eagerly
watched
the
man
behind
the
little
window
count
out
five
tickets
and
put
them
in
a
pink
envelope
one
for
you
one
for
your
mother
and
three
for
the
kids
said
his
friend
as
billy
buttoned
the
treasure
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
ragged
coat
he
was
so
excited
that
he
almost
forgot
his
part
of
the
bargain
but
as
the
gentleman
was
turning
away
he
remembered
say
mister
where
must
i
take
the
kindlin
to
oh
that
all
right
you
can
sell
it
answered
the
other
billy
face
fell
instantly
if
you
do
take
the
kindlin
have
to
give
you
back
the
tickets
ma
do
us
to
take
that
way
but
i
do
need
the
kindling
have
any
place
to
put
it
ai
you
got
no
home
asked
billy
incredulously
no
answered
the
man
shortly
the
idea
of
any
one
in
any
walk
of
life
not
having
use
for
kindling
was
a
new
one
to
billy
but
he
had
no
time
to
dwell
on
it
for
this
new
complication
demanded
all
his
attention
ai
there
nobody
you
could
give
it
to
he
asked
the
gentleman
was
growing
impatient
no
no
go
along
that
all
right
but
billy
knew
it
would
not
be
all
right
when
he
got
home
so
he
made
one
more
effort
how
you
like
to
send
it
out
to
miss
hazy
he
inquired
well
miss
hazy
not
having
the
pleasure
of
my
acquaintance
might
object
to
the
delicate
attention
who
is
she
she
chris
aunt
they
ai
had
no
fire
fer
two
days
oh
said
the
man
heartily
take
it
to
miss
hazy
by
all
means
tell
her
it
from
bob
who
is
worse
off
than
she
is
for
he
has
even
a
home
an
hour
later
there
was
wild
excitement
under
the
only
tin
roof
in
the
cabbage
patch
such
scrubbing
and
brushing
as
was
taking
place
it
jes
like
a

while
the
iron

an
hot
this
painful
operation
was
performed
only
on
state
occasions
each
little
wiggs
laid
her
head
on
the
a
willing
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
vanity
while
wiggs
carefully
ironed
out
five
plaits
on
each
head
europena
was
the
only
one
who
objected
to
being
a
but
when
she
saw
the
frizzled
locks
of
the
others
her
pride
conquered
her
fear
and
holding
tight
to
billy
hand
she
bent
her
chubby
head
to
the
trying
ordeal
now
billy

run
over
to

minute

sure
to

vigorously
brushed
her
hair
with
the
as
she
spoke
australia

thrown
the
down
the
cistern
the
summer
before
asia
you
go

the
alpaca
from
behind
the
chest
an
sorter
shake
it
out
on
the
bed
who
goin
to
wear
it
ma
the
question
came
in
anxious
tones
for
the
blue
alpaca
had
been
sent
them
in
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
and
though
it
failed
to
fit
either
of
the
girls
the
wearing
of
it
was
a
much
coveted
privilege
well
now
i
do
know
said
wiggs
critically
surveying
the
children
it
wo
button
good
on
you
and
swags
in
the
back
on
australia
lem
me
wear
it
ma
no
lem
me
came
in
excited
tones
wiggs
had
seen
trouble
before
over
the
blue
alpaca
she
knew
what
anguish
her
decision
must
bring
to
one
or
the
other
it
really
looks
best
on
asia
she
thought
but
if
i
let
her
wear
it
austry
have
a
cryin
spell
an
git
to
holdin
her
breath
that
take
up
so
much
time

she
added
aloud
i
tell
you
what
we
do
asia
you
kin
wear
the
skirt
an
austry
kin
wear
the
waist
but
when
she
had
pinned
the
skirt
over
one
little
girl
red
calico
dress
and
buttoned
the
blue
waist
over
the
clean
apron
of
the
other
she
looked
at
them
dubiously
they
do
look
kinder
mixed
she
admitted
to
herself
but
i
reckon
it
do
matter
so
long
as
they
both
happy
just
here
billy
came
in
with
the
veil
in
one
hand
and
a
bunch
of
faded
carnations
in
the
other
look
ma
he
exclaimed
holding
up
his
trophy

swapped
with

rather
shabby
his

out
and
two
of
the
holes
in
his
pants
were
patched
and
two
were

decided
and
billy
wore
the
comforter
at
seven
o
they
were
ready
and
the
news
having
spread
abroad
that
the
wiggses
were
going
to
a
show
many
of
the
neighbors
came
in
to
see
how
they
looked
and
to
hear
how
it

to

wiggs
said
nervously
as
she
stepped
off
the
porch
the
little
procession
had
left
the
railroad
tracks
far
behind
when
wiggs
stopped
suddenly
fer
the
land
sakes
alive
do

know
what
we
gone
an
done

have
left
the
theayter

began
to
cry
and
a
gloom
settled
upon
the
party
billy
you
run
back
fast
as
yer
legs
kin
carry
you
an
look
in
that
tin
can
behind
the
clock
an
we
wait
right
here
fer
you
wiggs
wrapped
europena
in
her
shawl
and
tried
to
keep
up
the
spirits
of
the
party
as
they
huddled
on
the
curbing
to
await
return
look
how
pretty
it
looks
all
the
lights
out
the
winders
on
the
snow
looks
like
a
chromo
ma
used
to
have
but
the
young
wiggses
were
in
no
frame
of
mind
to
appreciate
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scene
it
was
very
cold
and
even
the
prospect
of
the
show
was
dimmed
by
the
present
discomfort
by
and
by
australia
sobs
began
anew
what
the
matter
honey
do
cry
billy
be
back
in
a
little
while
an
then
we
git
in
where
it
good
an
warm
i
want
my
supper
wailed
australia
then
it
dawned
on
wiggs
for
the
first
time
that
in
the
excitement
of
preparation
supper
had
been
entirely
overlooked
well
if
that
do
beat
all
said
she
i
had
jes
as
much
idea
of
supper
as
a
goat
has
of
kid
gloves
but
when
billy
came
flying
back
with
the
tickets
and
the
party
had
started
once
more
on
the
long
walk
to
the
opera
house
the
enticing
posters
began
to
appear
and
supper
and
the
cold
were
forgotten
chapter
vii
bob
if
his
heart
at
high
floods
swamped
his
brain
now
and
then
was
but
richer
for
that
when
the
tide
ebbed
again
a
large
audience
assembled
that
night
to
witness
the
greatest
extravaganza
of
the
century
the
opera
house
was
a
blaze
of
light
and
color
from
the
recesses
of
one
of
the
boxes
redding
made
a
careful
survey
of
the
faces
beneath
him
first
nights
usually
found
him
there
with
the
same
restless
eager
look
in
his
eyes
tonight
he
evidently
failed
to
find
what
he
sought
and
was
turning
listlessly
away
when
he
stopped
suddenly
bent
forward
then
smiled
broadly
he
had
caught
sight
of
billy
red
comforter
the
boy
hair
was
plastered
close
to
his
head
and
his
face
was
transformed
by
soap
and
happiness
redding
glanced
quizzically
at
the
rest
of
the
party
at
the
mother
radiant
countenance
beaming
from
the
dusk
of
her
crepe
veil
at
the
three
little
girls
in
their
composite
costumes
at
the
carnations
pinned
on
each
bosom
then
he
deliberately
turned
his
back
on
the
greatest
extravaganza
of
the
century
and
centered
his
attention
on
the
parquet
group
it
was
a
singularly
enthusiastic
theater
party
oblivious
of
surroundings
and
lost
in
wonder
at
the
strange
sights
laugh
rang
out
frequently
with
refreshing
spontaneity
their
enjoyment
was
so
evident
that
redding
was
surprised
at
the
close
of
the
first
act
to
see
them
put
on
their
wraps
and
march
solemnly
out
of
the
theater
he
hastened
to
the
lobby
and
touched
billy
on
the
shoulder
did
you
like
the
show
he
asked
you
bet
said
billy
his
eyes
shining
and
his
cheeks
flushed
wiggs
was
hopelessly
entangled
in
the
crepe
veil
but
her
ideas
of
etiquette
were
rigid
she
disengaged
one
hand
and
said
with
dignity
i
this
is
bob
billy
friend
happy
to
meet
yer
acquaintance
asia
speak
to
the
gentleman
australia
europena
with
a
commanding
nod
at
each
three
small
hands
were
thrust
at
redding
simultaneously
and
he
accommodated
them
all
in
his
broad
palm
but
why
are
you
going
home
he
asked
looking
from
one
to
the
other
where
else
would
we
go
to
asked
wiggs
in
amazement
why
not
stay
and
see
the
play
out
that
was
only
the
first
act
is
there
some
more
ma
asked
asia
eagerly
why
of
course
explained
redding
lots
more
now
go
back
and
stay
until
everybody
has
left
the
theater
and
then
you
will
be
certain
it
over
so
back
they
went
furnishing
an
amusing
for
the
impatient
audience
after
the
curtain
descended
on
the
final
tableau
redding
waited
in
the
lobby
while
the
stream
of
people
passed
the
wiggses
had
obeyed
instructions
and
were
the
very
last
to
come
out
they
seemed
dazed
by
their
recent
glimpse
into
something
in
their
thin
bodies
and
pinched
faces
made
redding
form
a
sudden
resolve
billy
he
said
gravely
ca
you
and
your
family
take
supper
with
me
billy
and
his
mother
exchanged
doubtful
glances
for
the
past
three
hours
everything
had
been
so
strange
and
unusual
that
they
were
bewildered
you
see
we
will
go
right
over
to
bond
and
have
something
to
eat
before
you
go
home
urged
redding
wiggs
was
in
great
doubt
but
one
of
the
little
girls
pulled
her
skirt
and
said
in
pleading
tones
ma
let
do
and
billy
was
already
casting
longing
eyes
at
the
big
restaurant
across
the
way
she
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
as
they
were
crossing
the
street
asia
stopped
suddenly
and
cried
ma
there
the
lady
gittin
in
that
hack
she
seen
us
look
but
before
they
could
turn
the
carriage
door
had
slammed
redding
took
them
into
a
small
apartment
curtained
off
from
the
rest
of
the
cafe
so
that
only
the
waiters
commented
on
the
strange
party
at
first
there
was
oppressive
silence
then
the
host
turned
to
europena
and
asked
her
what
she
liked
best
to
eat
a
moment
of
torture
ensued
for
the
small
lady
during
which
she
nearly
twisted
her
thumb
from
its
socket
then
she
managed
to
gasp
green
pups
bob
laughed
why
you
little
cannibal
he
said
what
on
earth
does
she
mean
cream
puffs
explained
wiggs
airily
she
et
onct
at
reed
the
bourbon
stock
yard
wife
an
she
been
ever
sence
after
this
the
ice
while
not
broken
at
least
had
a
crack
in
it
and
by
the
time
the
first
course
was
served
redding
was
telling
them
a
funny
story
and
three
of
the
audience
were
able
to
smile
it
had
pleased
him
to
order
an
elaborate
supper
and
he
experienced
the
keenest
enjoyment
over
the
novelty
of
the
situation
the
wiggses
ate
as
he
had
never
seen
people
eat
before
for
speed
and
durability
they
break
the
record
was
his
mental
comment
he
sat
by
and
with
consummate
tact
made
them
forget
everything
but
the
good
time
they
were
having
as
the
supper
progressed
wiggs
became
communicative
she
still
wore
her
black
cotton
gloves
and
gesticulated
with
a
chicken
croquette
as
she
talked
yes
she
was
saying
jim
was
one
of
these
handy
childern
when
he
was
eight
years
old
he
could
peddle
as
good
as
you
could
i
guess
you
heard
our
roof
was
talkin
it
billy
is
takin
right
after
him
do
you
know
what
that
boy
has
gone
an
done
he
built
his
pa
a
monumint
a
monument
exclaimed
redding
yes
sir
a
tombstun
monumint
i
was
allers
that
wiggs
could
have
a
monumint
and
billy
never
said
a
word
but
he
set
his
head
to
it
one
day
he
come
home
with
a
lot
of
these
here
tiles
what
they
had
throwed
out
from
the
tile
some
of
was
jes
a
little
nicked
an
the
others
was
jes
as
good
as
new
well
he
kep
on
gittin
ever
day
or
two
till
he
had
a
pile
ever
night
he
used
to
set
on
the
floor
an
fool
with
them
things
here
an
crackin
off
there
but
i
never
paid
no
to
him
one
night
when
i
come
in
from
eichorn
what
did
i
see
on
the
floor
but
a
an
spelt
out
in
little
blue
tiles
down
the
middle
was
gone
but
not
forgotten
i
was
jes
that
pleased
i
set
down
an
bust
out
cryin
we
made
a
sorter
box
to
hold
it
an
chinked
it
up
with
cement
an
sunday
me
an
the
childern
took
it
out
an
fixed
it
up
on
wiggs
grave
some
day
we
are
going
to
make
jimmy
one
you
know
jimmy
my
boy
that
dead
her
eyes
filled
and
her
lips
trembled
even
the
sunshine
of
her
buoyant
nature
could
not
dispel
one
shadow
that
always
lay
across
her
heart
at
this
moment
billy
doubtless
thrilled
at
being
the
topic
of
conversation
upset
his
glass
of
water
and
the
deluge
descended
full
upon
australia
drenching
the
waist
of
the
blue
alpaca
such
a
wail
as
arose
threats
and
persuasion
were
alike
unavailing
she
even
refused
to
be
mopped
off
but
slid
in
a
disconsolate
heap
under
the
table
redding
attempted
to
invade
the
citadel
with
an
orange
as
a
flag
of
truce
but
his
overtures
were
ineffectual
and
he
was
compelled
to
retreat
under
fire
i
leave
her
be
bob
advised
wiggs
placidly
as
she
spread
her
salad
on
a
piece
of
bread
she
git
to
holdin
her
breath
if
you
notice
her
the
shrieks
gradually
diminished
to
spasmodic
sobs
which
in
turn
gave
place
to
ominous
silence
billy
said
redding
taking
wiggs
advice
and
ignoring
the
flood
sufferer
how
would
you
like
to
be
my
i
like
it
a
heap
answered
billy
promptly
redding
turned
to
wiggs
you
see
it
a
newspaper
office
and
while
the
pay
is
much
at
first
still
it
better
than
peddling
kindling
and
there
would
be
a
chance
for
promotion
as
he
got
older
oh
yes
answered
wiggs
complacently
there
would
be
no
trouble
billy
promotin
i
he
could
take
to
newspapers
right
away
if
you
could
hold
him
down
to
it
he
like
his
pa
the
very
spittin
image
of
him
wiggs
was
so
educated
the
most
fluent
man
in
jography
i
ever
seen
i
goin
to
be
like
bob
when
i
grow
up
said
billy
stoutly
his
recollection
of
his
paternal
parent
was
not
the
sort
ideals
are
made
of
just
here
the
waiter
appeared
with
the
final
course
and
asia
lifted
the
tablecloth
and
whispered
say
we
got
no
answer
then
little
europena
with
baby
wisdom
put
her
tow
head
under
the
cloth
and
said
it
pink
and
australia
emerged
but
smiling
and
finished
her
supper
on
bob
knee
when
the
limit
of
capacity
had
been
tested
to
the
fullest
and
billy
had
declared
that
he
could
swaller
no
more
he
was
chawin
redding
filled
their
pockets
with
candy
and
when
wiggs
was
not
looking
put
a
quarter
in
each
hand
then
he
rang
for
a
carriage
and
in
spite
of
wiggs
protestations
he
put
them
in
and
repeated
billy
directions
as
to
the
exact
location
of
the
cabbage
patch
my
my
ai
this
nice
said
wiggs
leaning
back
against
carriage
cushions
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
while
redding
lifted
europena
in
beside
her
we
seed
a
good
time
fer
onct
in
our
lives
said
asia
it
was
the
first
time

had
spoken
since
they
left
the
theater
lem
me
ride
up
on
top
ma
demanded
billy
eagerly
lem
me
too
lem
me
came
from
the
sleepy
australia
who
did
not
know
what
new
attraction
was
being
offered
but
was
resolved
not
to
miss
anything
all
right
billy
but
austry
you
must
stay
with
ma
bob
and
thanks
thanks
fer
one
an
all
redding
stood
on
the
corner
where
they
had
left
him
and
the
smile
died
out
of
his
face
within
a
block
was
a
jolly
crowd
and
a
hearty
welcome
across
the
street
was
the
big
apartment
house
where
his
dark
and
cheerless
window
promised
him
nothing
for
a
moment
he
stood
irresolute
there
is
certainly
nobody
to
care
where
i
go
he
thought
gloomily
then
suddenly
the
smile
came
back
but
if
i
to
be
billy
wiggs
model
i
guess
i
better
go
to
bed
he
ran
lightly
across
the
street
and
up
the
broad
stone
steps
chapter
viii
wiggs
at
home
she
had
a
sunny
nature
that
sought
like
a
flower
in
a
dark
place
for
the
light
on
christmas
day
lucy
olcott
stood
by
the
library
window
and
idly
scratched
initials
on
the
frosty
pane
a
table
full
of
beautiful
gifts
stood
near
and
a
great
bunch
of
roses
on
the
piano
filled
the
room
with
fragrance
but
lucy
evidently
found
something
more
congenial
in
the
dreary
view
outside
she
was
deep
in
thought
when
the
door
opened
and
aunt
chloe
came
in
with
a

she
went
over
to
the
fire
and
held
her
hands
to
the
friendly
blaze
there
was
a
restless
discontented
look
in
her
eyes
that
proved
only
too
plainly
that
her
christmas

the

said
lucy
impatiently
she
had
begun
disobeying
aunt
chloe
when
she
was
a
very
little
girl
fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
tramping
through
the
snow
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
spirits
rising
the
wiggses
while
always
interesting
had
of
late
acquired
a
new
significance
since
seeing
them
in
the
theater
lobby
with
robert
redding
she
had
found
it
necessary
to
make
several
visits
to
the
cabbage
patch
and
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
had
been
bob
how
he
had
taken
them
to
the
show

made
billy
his
had
sent
them
a
barrel
of
apples
and
was
coming
to
see
them
some
day
to
which
deluge
of
information
lucy
had
listened
with
outward
calmness
and
inward
thrills
as
she
entered
the
wiggses
gate
a
shout
greeted
her
billy
let
himself
down
from
the
roof
and
ran
forward
them
roman

europena

she
lifted
the
wailing
little
girl
to
her
lap
and
looked
her
sternly
in
the
eye
if
you
do
hush
this
minute
i
spank
your
doll
the
awful
threat
was
sufficient
wiggs
had
long
ago
discovered
the
most
effectual
way
of
punishing
europena
when
peace
was
restored
lucy
looked
about
her
in
each
window
was
a
piece
of
holly
tied
with
a
bit
of
red
calico
and
on
the
partly
cleared
table
she
saw
the
remains
of
a
real
christmas

old
solemn
face
and
clever
fingers

her
favorite
of
the
children

asked
as
the
child
dipped
a
brush
into
one
of
three
cans

spray
of

have
passed
for
cauliflower
the

encircled
by
a
wreath
of
impressionistic
roses
and
on

real
injun
blood
in
his
veins

a
squaw
a
injun
squaw
lucy
made
a
heroic
effort
to
keep
a
solemn
face
as
she
asked

like

of
an
after

way
of
an
i
was
added
wiggs
laughing
ordinarily
lucy
found
endless
diversion
in
listening
to
the
family
reminiscences
but
another
subject
was
on
her
mind
how
is
billy
getting
along
she
asked

wiggs
only

subterfuge

too
if

sets
his
head
to

only
he
never

them
big
brown
eyes
an
white
teeth
bob
got
why
when
bob
smiles
it
jes
sort
of
breaks
up
his
whole
face
lucy
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
mammoth
butterfly
upon
whose
iridescent
wings
asia
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
but
her
thoughts
were
far
away
i
jes
wish
you
could
see
him
went
on
wiggs
enthusiastically
i
wish
i
could
said
lucy
with
such
fervor
that
wiggs
paused
on
her
way
to
answer
a
knock
at
the
outside
door
there
was
a
scraping
of
feet
in
the
passage
i
have
been
driving
all
over
the
country
looking
for
you
said
a
man
voice
i
have
some
christmas
traps
for
the
kids
lucy
rose
hastily
and
turned
just
as
redding
entered
bob
this
is
miss
lucy
announced
wiggs
triumphantly
she
was
jes
she
like
to
see
you
if
a
angel
straight
from
the
peaks
of
paradise
had
been
presented
to
him
redding
could
not
have
been
more
astounded
nor
more
enraptured
but
to
lucy
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
chagrin
and
embarrassment
during
the
long
silence
of
the
past
year
she
had
persuaded
herself
that
redding
no
longer
cared
for
her
to
be
thrust
upon
him
in
this
way
was
intolerable
all
the
blood
in
her
veins
rushed
to
her
face
do
you
know
where
my
muff
is
mrs
wiggs
she
asked
after
a
formal
greeting
oh
you
ai
asked
the
hostess
anxiously
i
wanted
you
all
to
git
acquainted
yes
i
must
go
said
lucy
hurriedly
if
you
will
find
my
muff
she
stood
nervously
pulling
on
her
gloves
while
wiggs
searched
for
the
lost
property
there
was
a
deafening
tumult
in
her
heart
and
though
she
bit
her
lips
to
keep
from
laughing
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
austry
under
the
bed
announced
europena
who
had
joined
in
the
quest
i
ai
came
in
shrill
indignant
tones
as
wiggs
dragged
forth
the
culprit
and
restored
the
muff
may
i
drive
you
over
to
the
avenue
i
am
going
that
way
it
was
redding
voice
but
it
sounded
queer
and
unnatural
oh
no
no
thank
you
gasped
lucy
hardly
knowing
what
she
said
her
one
idea
was
to
get
away
before
she
broke
down
completely
redding
held
the
door
open
as
she
passed
out
his
face
was
cold
calm
inscrutable
not
a
quiver
of
the
mouth
not
a
flutter
of
the
lids
but
the
light
went
out
of
his
eyes
and
hope
died
in
his
heart
wiggs
stood
watching
the
scene
in
perplexity
i
dunno
what
ailed
miss
lucy
she
said
apologetically
hope
it
was
the
toothache
chapter
ix
how
spring
came
to
the
cabbage
patch
the
roads
the
woods
the
heavens
the
hills
are
not
a
world
but
just
a
place
god
made
for
us
in
which
to
play
when
the
last
snow
of
the
winter
had
melted
and
the
water
was
no
longer
frozen
about
the
corner
pump
the
commons
lost
their
hard
brown
look
and
a
soft
green
tinge
appeared
instead
there
were
not
many
ways
of
telling
when
spring
came
to
the
cabbage
patch
no
trees
shook
forth
their
glad
little
leaves
of
welcome
no
anemones
and
brought
the
gentle
message
even
the
birds
that
winged
their
way
from
the
hurried
by
without
so
much
as
a
chirp
of
greeting
but
the
cabbage
patch
knew
it
was
spring
nevertheless
something
whispered
it
in
the
air
a
dozen
little
signs
gave
the
secret
away
weeds
were
springing
up
in
the
fence
corners
the
puddles
which
a
few
months
ago
were
covered
with
ice
now
reflected
bits
of
blue
sky
and
the
best
token
of
all
was
the
bright
warm
sunshine
that
clung
to
the
earth
as
if
to
love
it
back
into
beauty
and
life
again
one
afternoon
wiggs
stood
at
her
gate
talking
to
redding
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
there
since
christmas
day
for
his
first
visit
had
been
too
painful
for
him
to
desire
to
repeat
it
yes
indeed
billy
kin
go
wiggs
was
saying
i
mighty
glad
you
drove
him
by
home
to
git
on

the
fair
grounds

be
a
big
treat

mornin

wiggs
so
i
did
disturb
him
he
ai
fer
long
pore
feller
no
poor
chap
said
redding
sadly
wiggs
saw
the
shadow
on
his
face
and
hastened
to
change
the
subject
what
do
you
think
of
asia
fence
she
asked
what

redding
almost
incredulously
as
he
examined
the
fence
and
sidewalk
how
old
is
she
fourteen
goin
on
to
fifteen
asia
come
here
the
girl
left
the
she

very
big
girl

redding
smiling
at
her
how
would
you
like
to
go
up
to
the
tile
factory
and
learn
to
do
decorating
her
serious
face
lit
up
with
great
enthusiasm
she
forgot
her
shyness
and
said
eagerly
oh

i
before
redding
could
answer
wiggs
broke
in
you

gittin
a
artist

that
there

an
make

much

which
billy
appearance
at
this
moment
saved
redding
from
immediate
disgrace
you
come
to
the
office
with
billy
in
the
morning
he
called
to
asia
as
they
started
off
we
see
what
can
be
done
asia
went
back
to
her
digging
with
a
will
the
prospect
of
work
of
learning
how
to
do
things
right
and
above
all
of
learning
how
to
paint
filled
her
with
happiness
if
i
was
you
i
make
that
bed
in
the
shape
of
a
star
said
her
mother
breaking
in
on
her
rejections
why
do
you
make
it
a
mason
star
yer
pa
was
a
fine
mason
it
would
be
a
sort
of
compliment
to
him
what
is
a
mason
star
like
asked
asia
well
now
i
ai
right
sure
whether
it
got
five
points
or
six
either
way
will
do
lands
alive
i
do
believe
there
comes
miss
lucy
lucy
olcott
had
been
a
frequent
visitor
of
late
through
wiggs
she
had
gotten
interested
in
schultz
and
often
stopped
in
to
read
to
the
bedridden
old
lady
here
of
course
she
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
eichorns
the
elite
of
the
cabbage
patch
whose
domestic
infelicities
furnished
the
chief
interest
in
life
lucy
had
even
stood
on
a
chair
at
the
invalid
earnest
request
to
count
the
jars
of
preserves
in
the
eichorn
pantry
later
she
had
become
acquainted
with
miss
hazy
the
patient
little
woman
in
monochrome
whose
whole
pitiful
existence
was
an
apology
when
it
might
have
been
a
protest
in
fact
lucy
became
an
important
personage
in
the
neighborhood
she
was
sought
for
advice
called
upon
for
comfort
and
asked
to
share
many
joys
her
approach
was
usually
heralded
by
a
shout
her
and
she
was
invariably
escorted
across
the
commons
by
a
guard
of
ragged
but
devoted
youngsters
and
the
friendship
of
these
simple
people
opened
her
eyes
to
the
great
problems
of
humanity
and
as
she
worked
among
them
and
knew
life
as
it
was
the
hard
little
bud
of
her
girlhood
blossomed
into
the
great
soft
rose
of
womanhood
did
you
meet
bob
up
the
street

wiggs

she
led

a
man
with
a
spine
in
his
back
an
a
lady

wiggs
i
i
use
to
worry
some
over
wiggs
the
last
he
uster
pretty
often
here
wiggs
tipped
an
imaginary
bottle
to
her
lips
and
gave
lucy
a
significant
wink
even
in
the
strictest
confidence
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
of
the
weakness
of
the
late
lamented
but
no
matter
how
bad
he
done
he
always
tried
to
do
better
dick
sorter
puts
me
in
mind
of
him
that
who

mr

he
bob
friend
stays
at
his

mishap
is
one
thing
to
be
tempted
another
thing
to
fall
through
the
long
sunny
afternoon
wiggs
sang
over
her
ironing
and
asia
worked
diligently
in
her
around
the
corner
of
the
shed
which
served
as
cuba
australia
and
europena
made
peace
and
harmony
reigned
in
this
shabby
garden
of
eden
until
temptation
entered
and
the
weakest
fell
ai
no

search
for

it
wo

but
a
little
teeny
bit
they
never
miss
it
after
some
time
the
desired
object
was
discovered
on
a
shelf
in
the
shed
its
high
position
enhanced
its
value
giving
it
the
cruel
fascination
of
the
unattainable
could
you
stand
up
on
my
soldiers
like
the
man
at
the
show
demanded
australia
i
fall

said
europena
taunted
her
sister
in
disgust
do

the
chair
while
i
climbed
up
on
the
back
it
ai
got
no
bottom
well
it
do
need
to
have
no
bottom
if
i
goin
to
stand
on
its

said
australia
sharply
leaders
of
great
enterprises
must
of
necessity
turn
deaf
ears
to
words
of
discouragement
you
might
git
killed
persisted
europena

they

a
hole
an
throw
dirt
on
you
australia
had
become
so
absorbed
in
her
theory
of
reincarnation
that
she
had
forgotten
the
paint
but
the
bottomless
chair
recalled
it
now
you
lay
the
chair
europena
an
i
climb
up
she
commanded
europena
though
violently
opposed
to
the
undertaking
would
not
forsake
her
leader
at
a
critical
moment
she
had
uttered
her
protest
had
tried
in
vain
to
stem
the
current
of
events
nothing
was
left
her
now
but
to
do
or
die
she
valiantly
braced
her
small
body
across
the
frame
of
the
chair
and
australia
began
her
perilous
ascent
cuba
looked
mildly
astonished
as
the
plump
figure
of
the
little
girl
appeared
above
his
i
got
it
cried
australia
reaching
as
high
as
possible
and
getting
her
forefinger
over
the
edge
of
the
big
can
at
this
juncture
cuba
whose
nose
had
doubtless
been
tickled
by
australia
gave
a
prodigious
sneeze
europena
feeling
that
retribution
was
upon
them
fled
in
terror
the
ballast
being
removed
from
the
chair
the
result
was
inevitable
a
crash
a
heterogeneous
combination
of
small
girl
green
paint
and
shattered
chair
then
a
series
of
shrieks
that
resembled
the
whistles
on
new
year
eve
redding
was
the
first
to
the
rescue
he
had
just
driven
billy
to
the
gate
when
the
screams
began
and
with
a
bound
he
was
out
of
the
buggy
and
rushing
to
the
scene
of
disaster
the
picture
that
met
his
eyes
staggered
him
australia
screaming
wildly
lay
in
what
appeared
to
his
excited
vision
to
be
a
pool
of
green
blood
europena
was
jumping
up
and
down
beside
her
calling
wildly
for
her
mother
while
cuba
with
ears
erect
and
a
green
liquid
trickling
down
his
nose
sternly
surveyed
the
wreck
in
a
moment
redding
had
australia
in
his
arms
and
was
mopping
the
paint
from
her
face
and
hair
there
there
little
sister
you
are
much
hurt
he
was
saying
as
wiggs
and
asia
rushed
in
the
damage
done
proved
external
rather
than
internal
so
after
assuring
herself
that
no
bones
were
broken
wiggs
constituted
herself
a
salvage
corps
take
off
yer
coat
out
here
bob
an
i
take
off
dress
them
the
worst
her
plaits
now
we
all
go
up
to
the
kitchen
an
see
what
kin
be
did
now
fate
or
it
may
have
been
the
buggy
at
the
gate
decreed
that
just
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
lucy
olcott
should
be
coming
up
the
walk
for
a
moment
she
stood
bewildered
at
the
sight
that
greeted
her
redding
in
his
shirt
sleeves
was
leading
australia
by
the
hand
the
little
girl
wore
a
petticoat
and
over
her
face
and
hands
and
to
the
full
length
of
her
flaxen
braids
ran
sticky
streams
of
bright
green
paint
involuntarily
lucy
looked
at
redding
for
explanation
and
they
both
laughed
ai
it
lucky
it
was
the
back
of
her
head
of
the
front
said
wiggs
coming
up
it
might
put
her
eyes
out
pore
chile
she
looks
like
a
mollygraw
come
right
in
an
let
git
to
work
billy
was
despatched
for
turpentine
lucy
with
an
apron
pinned
about
her
began
operations
on
australia
hair
while
redding
sat
helplessly
by
waiting
for
wiggs
to
make
his
coat
presentable
i
am
afraid
her
hair
will
have
to
be
cut
said
lucy
ruefully
as
she
held
up
a
tangled
snarl
of
yellow
and
green
all
right
wiggs
said
promptly
whatever
you
say
is
all
right
but
australia
felt
differently
her
sobs
suppressed
for
a
time
broke
forth
afresh
i
ai
goin
to
have
my
hair
cut
off
she
wept
jes
leave
it
on
this
wiggs
commanded
and
lucy
entreated
in
vain
finally
redding
drew
his
chair
up
in
front
of
the
small
girl
australia
listen
to
me
just
a
moment
wo
you
please
she
uncovered
one
eye
you
would
want
green
hair
would
you
a
violent
shake
of
the
head
well
if
you
will
let
miss
olcott
cut
off
all
that
ugly
green
hair
and
give
the
pretty
curls
a
chance
to
grow
back
i
give
you
see
what
shall
i
give
you
a
an
dishes
suggested
europena
who
was
standing
by
yes
he
said
and
dishes
and
a
dollar
besides
such
munificence
was
not
to
be
withstood
australia
suffered
herself
to
be
shorn
in
view
of
the
future
tempering
of
the
wind
you
orter
been
a
bob
said
wiggs
admiringly
when
the
deed
was
accomplished
yer
voice
jes
makes
folks
do
things
not
everybody
wiggs
he
said
grimly
where
do
you
suppose
billy
went
with
the
turkentine
i
declare
that
boy
would
be
a
good
one
to
send
after
trouble
oh

goin
to
try
an
wear
it
this
she
said
as
redding
insisted
on
putting
on
his
coat
as
he
turned
to
the
door
a
light
hand
touched
his
arm
lucy
unfastened
the
violets
at
her
belt
and
timidly
held
them
toward
him
will
you
take
them
to
dick
she
faltered
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
but
her
eyes
made
the
silence
eloquent
they
told
the
secret
that
her
lips
dared
not
utter
there
are
times
when
explanations
are
superfluous
redding
threw
discretion
to
the
winds
and
regardless
of
wiggses
and
consequences
took
the
christmas
lady
in
his
arms
and
kissed
away
the
year
of
grief
and
separation
it
was
not
until
wiggs
saw
their
trap
disappear
in
the
twilight
that
she
recovered
her
speech
well
it
certainly
do
beat
me
she
exclaimed
after
a
fruitless
effort
to
reconstruct
her
standard
of
propriety
i
heard
of
colic
but
i
never
knowed
it
to
go

notwithstanding
the
fact
that
calamities
seldom
come
singly
it
was
not
until
the
fourth
of
july
that
the
cabbage
patch
was
again
the
scene
of
an
accident
wiggs
had
been
hanging
out
clothes
and
was
turning
to
pick
up
the
empty
basket
when
billy
precipitated
himself
into
the
yard
yelling
wildly
chris

broke
his

wiggs
threw
up
her
hands
in
horror

billy
where

at

wiggs
rushed
into
the
house

cautioned

chile
how

him
i
run
down
the
track
an
meet
she
was
breathless
and
trembling
from
excitement
as
she
turned
the
corner
at
schultz
a
crowd
of
boys
were
coming
up
the
track
trundling
a
wheelbarrow
in
which
sat
chris
hazy
the
merriest
of
the
lot
waving
a
piece
of
his
wooden
leg
in
the
air
wiggs
turned
upon
billy
i

an

such
a
shout
went
up
that
wiggs
laughed
with
the
rest
but
only
for
a
moment
for
she
spied
miss
hazy
tottering
toward
them
and
she
hastened
forward
to
relieve
her
anxiety
it
his
she
shouted
this
information
instead
of
bringing
relief
to
miss
hazy
caused
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
she
sat
down
on
the
track
with
her
apron
over
her
face
and
swayed
backward
and
forward
do
make
much
difference
which
one
was
she
sobbed
it
would
be
as
easy
to
git
another
leg
as

las
one

seven
dollars
i
jes
sewed
an
saved
an
scrimped
to
git

an
now

the
boys
stood
around
in
silent
sympathy
and
when
nobody
was
looking
chris
wiped
his
eyes
on
his
coat
sleeve
miss
arrival
had
changed
their
point
of
view
wiggs
rose
to
the
occasion

and
the

being
put

at

the
parlor

it

asia
who
had
been
to
a
church
social
so
a
raid
was
made
on
the
neighborhood
and
every
available
chair
borrowed
and
ranged
against
the
parlor
wall
by
noon
the
boys
reported
most
of
the
tickets
sold
and
wiggs
received
the
funds
which
amounted
to
six
dollars
it
being
a
holiday
everybody
was
glad
to
come
to
the
dance
especially
as
the
proceeds
were
to
help
little
miss
hazy
at
one
time
there
threatened
to
be
trouble
about
the
music
some
wanted
uncle
tom
the
old
negro
who
usually
fiddled
at
the
dances
and
others
preferred
to
patronize
home
talent
and
have
jake
schultz
whose
accordion
could
be
heard
at
all
hours
in
the
cabbage
patch
wiggs
effected
a
compromise
they
kin
take
turn
about
she
argued
when
one
gits
tired
the
other
kin
pick
up
right
where
he
left
oft
an
the
young
folks
kin
shake
feet
till
they
shoes
drop
off
uncle
tom
an
jake
too
is
a
heap
sight
better
than
them
bands
that
play
the
streets
wisht
we
could
fix
the
yard
up
some
said
asia
when
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
in
the
parlor
i
got
a
japanee
lantern

miss
hazy
doubtfully
the
very
thing
said
wiggs
we
hang
it
in
the
front
door
billy
makin
a
jack
o
lantern
to
set
on
the
fence
fer
the
land
sake
what
john
bagby
in
here
the
grocery
boy
staggering
under
the
weight
of
an
freezer
and
carrying
something
wrapped
in
white
paper
came
up
the
path

fer
you
he
said
grinning
broadly
john
was
so
miss
hazy
thought
he
looked
at
wiggs
and
wiggs
thought
he
looked
at
miss
hazy
however
the
card
on
the
freezer
dispelled
all
doubt
fer
mrs
wiggs
on
her
birthday
compelments
of
the
naybors
under
the
white
paper
was
a
large
white
iced
cake
with
a
w
in
cinnamon

wiggs
in
delight
why
i
even

the
cake
fer
the
party
somehow
i
never
feel
like
good
things
to

till
i
pass

else
this
necessitated
a
supply
of
saucers
and
spoons
and
friends
were
again
called
upon
to
provide
as
many
as
possible
the
wiggses
were
quite
busy
until
seven
when
they
stopped
to
make
their
toilets
where
europena
asked
asia
nobody
had
seen
her
for
some
time
search
was
made
and
she
was
discovered
standing
on
a
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
parlor
calmly
eating
the
cinnamon
drops
off
the
birthday
cake
fingers
and
mouth
were
crimson
and
the
first
stroke
of
the
w

missing
billy
was
so
indignant
that
he
insisted
on
immediate
punishment

ai

birthday
billy

the
first
guest
to
arrive
was
krasmier
he
had
paid
ten
cents
toward
the
refreshments
and
proposed
to
get
his
money
worth
eichorn
came
early
too
but
for
a
different
reason
she
was
very
stout
and
her
happiness
for
the
evening
depended
largely
upon
the
size
of
the
chair
she
secured
half
the
spectators
had
arrived
before
the
hostess
appeared
her
delay
was
caused
by
the
loss
of
her
false
curls
which
she
had
not
worn
since
the
memorable
night
at
the
opera
house
they
were
very
black
and
very
frizzled
and
had
been
bought
at
a
reduced
price
from
a
traveling
salesman
some
ten
years
before
wiggs
considered
them
absolutely
necessary
to
her
toilet
on
state
occasions
hence
consternation
prevailed
when
they
could
not
be
found
drawers
were
upset
and
boxes
emptied
but
with
no
success
when
hope
was
about
abandoned
asia
suddenly
darted
out
to
the
shed
where
the
children
kept
their
when
she
returned
she
triumphantly
displayed
a
battered
doll
armless
and
footless
but
with
a
magnificent
crowning
glory
of
black
frizzed
hair
wiggs
waited
until
all
the
guests
assembled
before
she
made
her
speech
of
thanks
for
the
cake
and
cream
it
was
a
very
fine
speech
having
been
written
out
beforehand
by
bagby
it
began
ladies
and
gents
it
gives
me
pleasure
but
before
wiggs
got
half
through
she
forgot
it
and
had
to
tell
them
in
her
own
way
how
grateful
she
was
in
conclusion
she
said
could
nobody
be
more
obliged
than
what
i
am
looks
like
nice
things
is
always
comin
my
way
hope
god
bless
you

the
musicianers

so
we
begin
the
party
with
a
virginer
reel
the
young
people
scampered
to
their
places
and
when
eichorn
made
a
bow
to
wiggs
she
laughingly
took
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
line
and
at
the
first
strains
of
old
dan
tucker
she
went
down
the
middle
with
a
grace
and
spirit
that
flatly
contradicted
the
little

shy
glances
at
joe

keeping
company
of
late
billy
for
whom
there
was
no
room
in
the

off
his
energy
in
the
corner
by
a
noisy
execution
of
the
mobile
buck

europena
sat
in
the
window
with
chris

and
delightedly
clapped
time
to
the
music
when
the
dance
ended
wiggs
went
to
the
door
to
get
cool
she
was
completely
out
of
breath
and
her
false
front
had
worked
its
way
down
over
her
eyebrows

satisfaction

the
paint
after

lingered
a
moment
at
the
gate
music
and
laughter
came
from
the
house
behind
her
as
she
stood
smiling
out
across
the
moonlit
cabbage
patch
her
face
still
held
the
reflected
happiness
of
the
departed
lovers
as
the
sky
holds
the
after
