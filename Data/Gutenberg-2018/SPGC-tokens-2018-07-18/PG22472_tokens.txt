the
book
of
the
damned
a
procession
of
the
damned
by
the
damned
i
mean
the
excluded
we
shall
have
a
procession
of
data
that
science
has
excluded
battalions
of
the
accursed
captained
by
pallid
data
that
i
have
exhumed
will
march
you
read
them
or
they
march
some
of
them
livid
and
some
of
them
fiery
and
some
of
them
rotten
some
of
them
are
corpses
skeletons
mummies
twitching
tottering
animated
by
companions
that
have
been
damned
alive
there
are
giants
that
will
walk
by
though
sound
asleep
there
are
things
that
are
theorems
and
things
that
are
rags
they
go
by
like
euclid
arm
in
arm
with
the
spirit
of
anarchy
here
and
there
will
flit
little
harlots
many
are
clowns
but
many
are
of
the
highest
respectability
some
are
assassins
there
are
pale
stenches
and
gaunt
superstitions
and
mere
shadows
and
lively
malices
whims
and
amiabilities
the
na√Øve
and
the
pedantic
and
the
bizarre
and
the
grotesque
and
the
sincere
and
the
insincere
the
profound
and
the
puerile
a
stab
and
a
laugh
and
the
patiently
folded
hands
of
hopeless
propriety
the
but
the
condemned
anyway
the
aggregate
appearance
is
of
dignity
and
dissoluteness
the
aggregate
voice
is
a
defiant
prayer
but
the
spirit
of
the
whole
is
processional
the
power
that
has
said
to
all
these
things
that
they
are
damned
is
dogmatic
science
but
they
march
the
little
harlots
will
caper
and
freaks
will
distract
attention
and
the
clowns
will
break
the
rhythm
of
the
whole
with
their
buffooneries
but
the
solidity
of
the
procession
as
a
whole
the
impressiveness
of
things
that
pass
and
pass
and
pass
and
keep
on
and
keep
on
and
keep
on
coming
the
irresistibleness
of
things
that
neither
threaten
nor
jeer
nor
defy
but
arrange
themselves
in
that
pass
and
pass
and
keep
on
passing
so
by
the
damned
i
mean
the
excluded
but
by
the
excluded
i
mean
that
which
will
some
day
be
the
excluding
or
everything
that
is
wo
be
and
everything
that
is
will
be
but
of
course
will
be
that
which
wo
be
it
is
our
expression
that
the
flux
between
that
which
is
and
that
which
wo
be
or
the
state
that
is
commonly
and
absurdly
called
existence
is
a
rhythm
of
heavens
and
hells
that
the
damned
stay
damned
that
salvation
only
precedes
perdition
the
inference
is
that
some
day
our
accursed
tatterdemalions
will
be
sleek
angels
then
the
is
that
some
later
day
back
they
go
whence
they
came
it
is
our
expression
that
nothing
can
attempt
to
be
except
by
attempting
to
exclude
something
else
that
that
which
is
commonly
called
being
is
a
state
that
is
wrought
more
or
less
definitely
proportionately
to
the
appearance
of
positive
difference
between
that
which
is
included
and
that
which
is
excluded
but
it
is
our
expression
that
there
are
no
positive
differences
that
all
things
are
like
a
mouse
and
a
bug
in
the
heart
of
a
cheese
mouse
and
a
bug
no
two
things
could
seem
more
unlike
they
there
a
week
or
they
stay
there
a
month
both
are
then
only
transmutations
of
cheese
i
think
we
all
bugs
and
mice
and
are
only
different
expressions
of
an
cheese
or
that
red
is
not
positively
different
from
yellow
is
only
another
degree
of
whatever
vibrancy
yellow
is
a
degree
of
that
red
and
yellow
are
continuous
or
that
they
merge
in
orange
so
then
that
if
upon
the
basis
of
yellowness
and
redness
science
should
attempt
to
classify
all
phenomena
including
all
red
things
as
veritable
and
excluding
all
yellow
things
as
false
or
illusory
the
demarcation
would
have
to
be
false
and
arbitrary
because
things
colored
orange
constituting
continuity
would
belong
on
both
sides
of
the
attempted
borderline
as
we
go
along
we
shall
be
impressed
with
this
that
no
basis
for
classification
or
inclusion
and
exclusion
more
reasonable
than
that
of
redness
and
yellowness
has
ever
been
conceived
of
science
has
by
appeal
to
various
bases
included
a
multitude
of
data
had
it
not
done
so
there
would
be
nothing
with
which
to
seem
to
be
science
has
by
appeal
to
various
bases
excluded
a
multitude
of
data
then
if
redness
is
continuous
with
yellowness
if
every
basis
of
admission
is
continuous
with
every
basis
of
exclusion
science
must
have
excluded
some
things
that
are
continuous
with
the
accepted
in
redness
and
yellowness
which
merge
in
orangeness
we
typify
all
tests
all
standards
all
means
of
forming
an
opinion
or
that
any
positive
opinion
upon
any
subject
is
illusion
built
upon
the
fallacy
that
there
are
positive
differences
to
judge
by
that
the
quest
of
all
intellection
has
been
for
something
a
fact
a
basis
a
generalization
law
formula
a
major
premise
that
is
positive
that
the
best
that
has
ever
been
done
has
been
to
say
that
some
things
are
whereas
by
evidence
we
mean
the
support
of
something
else
that
this
is
the
quest
but
that
it
has
never
been
attained
but
that
science
has
acted
ruled
pronounced
and
condemned
as
if
it
had
been
attained
what
is
a
house
it
is
not
possible
to
say
what
anything
is
as
positively
distinguished
from
anything
else
if
there
are
no
positive
differences
a
barn
is
a
house
if
one
lives
in
it
if
residence
constitutes
houseness
because
style
of
architecture
does
not
then
a
bird
nest
is
a
house
and
human
occupancy
is
not
the
standard
to
judge
by
because
we
speak
of
dogs
houses
nor
material
because
we
speak
of
snow
houses
of
eskimos
or
a
shell
is
a
house
to
a
hermit
crab
or
was
to
the
mollusk
that
made
it
or
things
seemingly
so
positively
different
as
the
white
house
at
washington
and
a
shell
on
the
seashore
are
seen
to
be
continuous
so
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
say
what
electricity
is
for
instance
it
is
anything
as
positively
distinguished
from
heat
or
magnetism
or
life
metaphysicians
and
theologians
and
biologists
have
tried
to
define
life
they
have
failed
because
in
a
positive
sense
there
is
nothing
to
define
there
is
no
phenomenon
of
life
that
is
not
to
some
degree
manifest
in
chemism
magnetism
astronomic
motions
white
coral
islands
in
a
dark
blue
sea
their
seeming
of
distinctness
the
seeming
of
individuality
or
of
positive
difference
one
from
another
but
all
are
only
projections
from
the
same
sea
bottom
the
difference
between
sea
and
land
is
not
positive
in
all
water
there
is
some
earth
in
all
earth
there
is
some
water
so
then
that
all
seeming
things
are
not
things
at
all
if
all
are
any
more
than
is
the
leg
of
a
table
a
thing
in
itself
if
it
is
only
a
projection
from
something
else
that
not
one
of
us
is
a
real
person
if
physically
we
continuous
with
environment
if
psychically
there
is
nothing
to
us
but
expression
of
relation
to
environment
our
general
expression
has
two
aspects
conventional
monism
or
that
all
things
that
seem
to
have
identity
of
their
own
are
only
islands
that
are
projections
from
something
underlying
and
have
no
real
outlines
of
their
own
but
that
all
things
though
only
projections
are
projections
that
are
striving
to
break
away
from
the
underlying
that
denies
them
identity
of
their
own
i
conceive
of
one
nexus
in
which
and
of
which
all
seeming
things
are
only
different
expressions
but
in
which
all
things
are
localizations
of
one
attempt
to
break
away
and
become
real
things
or
to
establish
entity
or
positive
difference
or
final
demarcation
or
unmodified
independence
or
personality
or
soul
as
it
is
called
in
human
phenomena
that
anything
that
tries
to
establish
itself
as
a
real
or
positive
or
absolute
system
government
organization
self
soul
entity
individuality
can
so
attempt
only
by
drawing
a
line
about
itself
or
about
the
inclusions
that
constitute
itself
and
damning
or
excluding
or
breaking
away
from
all
other
things
that
if
it
does
not
so
act
it
can
not
seem
to
be
that
if
it
does
so
act
it
falsely
and
arbitrarily
and
futilely
and
disastrously
acts
just
as
would
one
who
draws
a
circle
in
the
sea
including
a
few
waves
saying
that
the
other
waves
with
which
the
included
are
continuous
are
positively
different
and
stakes
his
life
upon
maintaining
that
the
admitted
and
the
damned
are
positively
different
our
expression
is
that
our
whole
existence
is
animation
of
the
local
by
an
ideal
that
is
realizable
only
in
the
universal
that
if
all
exclusions
are
false
because
always
are
included
and
excluded
continuous
that
if
all
seeming
of
existence
perceptible
to
us
is
the
product
of
exclusion
there
is
nothing
that
is
perceptible
to
us
that
really
is
that
only
the
universal
can
really
be
our
especial
interest
is
in
modern
science
as
a
manifestation
of
this
one
ideal
or
purpose
or
process
that
it
has
falsely
excluded
because
there
are
no
positive
standards
to
judge
by
that
it
has
excluded
things
that
by
its
own
have
as
much
right
to
come
in
as
have
the
chosen
our
general
expression
that
the
state
that
is
commonly
and
absurdly
called
existence
is
a
flow
or
a
current
or
an
attempt
from
negativeness
to
positiveness
and
is
intermediate
to
both
by
positiveness
we
mean
harmony
equilibrium
order
regularity
stability
consistency
unity
realness
system
government
organization
liberty
independence
soul
self
personality
entity
individuality
truth
beauty
justice
perfection
definiteness
that
all
that
is
called
development
progress
or
evolution
is
movement
toward
or
attempt
toward
this
state
for
which
or
for
aspects
of
which
there
are
so
many
names
all
of
which
are
summed
up
in
the
one
word
positiveness
at
first
this
summing
up
may
not
be
very
readily
acceptable
at
first
it
may
seem
that
all
these
words
are
not
synonyms
that
harmony
may
mean
order
but
that
by
independence
for
instance
we
do
not
mean
truth
or
that
by
stability
we
do
not
mean
beauty
or
system
or
justice
i
conceive
of
one
nexus
which
expresses
itself
in
astronomic
phenomena
and
chemic
biologic
psychic
sociologic
that
it
is
everywhere
striving
to
localize
positiveness
that
to
this
attempt
in
various
fields
of
phenomena
which
are
only
we
give
different
names
we
speak
of
the
system
of
the
planets
and
not
of
their
government
but
in
considering
a
store
for
instance
and
its
management
we
see
that
the
words
are
interchangeable
it
used
to
be
customary
to
speak
of
chemic
equilibrium
but
not
of
social
equilibrium
that
false
demarcation
has
been
broken
down
we
shall
see
that
by
all
these
words
we
mean
the
same
state
as
conveniences
or
in
terms
of
common
illusions
of
course
they
are
not
synonyms
to
a
child
an
earth
worm
is
not
an
animal
it
is
to
the
biologist
by
beauty
i
mean
that
which
seems
complete
obversely
that
the
incomplete
or
the
mutilated
is
the
ugly
venus
de
milo
to
a
child
she
is
ugly
when
a
mind
adjusts
to
thinking
of
her
as
a
completeness
even
though
by
physiologic
standards
incomplete
she
is
beautiful
a
hand
thought
of
only
as
a
hand
may
seem
beautiful
found
on
a
battlefield
obviously
a
part
not
beautiful
but
everything
in
our
experience
is
only
a
part
of
something
else
that
in
turn
is
only
a
part
of
still
something
else
or
that
there
is
nothing
beautiful
in
our
experience
only
appearances
that
are
intermediate
to
beauty
and
ugliness
that
only
universality
is
complete
that
only
the
complete
is
the
beautiful
that
every
attempt
to
achieve
beauty
is
an
attempt
to
give
to
the
local
the
attribute
of
the
universal
by
stability
we
mean
the
immovable
and
the
unaffected
but
all
seeming
things
are
only
reactions
to
something
else
stability
too
then
can
be
only
the
universal
or
that
besides
which
there
is
nothing
else
though
some
things
seem
to
have
or
have
higher
approximations
to
stability
than
have
others
there
are
in
our
experience
only
various
degrees
of
intermediateness
to
stability
and
instability
every
man
then
who
works
for
stability
under
its
various
names
of
permanency
survival
duration
is
striving
to
localize
in
something
the
state
that
is
realizable
only
in
the
universal
by
independence
entity
and
individuality
i
can
mean
only
that
besides
which
there
is
nothing
else
if
given
only
two
things
they
must
be
continuous
and
mutually
affective
if
everything
is
only
a
reaction
to
something
else
and
any
two
things
would
be
destructive
of
each
other
independence
entity
or
individuality
all
attempted
organizations
and
systems
and
consistencies
some
approximating
far
higher
than
others
but
all
only
intermediate
to
order
and
disorder
fail
eventually
because
of
their
relations
with
outside
forces
all
are
attempted
completenesses
if
to
all
local
phenomena
there
are
always
outside
forces
these
attempts
too
are
realizable
only
in
the
state
of
completeness
or
that
to
which
there
are
no
outside
forces
or
that
all
these
words
are
synonyms
all
meaning
the
state
that
we
call
the
positive
state
that
our
whole
existence
is
a
striving
for
the
positive
state
the
amazing
paradox
of
it
all
that
all
things
are
trying
to
become
the
universal
by
excluding
other
things
that
there
is
only
this
one
process
and
that
it
does
animate
all
expressions
in
all
fields
of
phenomena
of
that
which
we
think
of
as
one
nexus
the
religious
and
their
idea
or
ideal
of
the
soul
they
mean
distinct
stable
entity
or
a
state
that
is
independent
and
not
a
mere
flux
of
vibrations
or
complex
of
reactions
to
environment
continuous
with
environment
merging
away
with
an
infinitude
of
other
interdependent
complexes
but
the
only
thing
that
would
not
merge
away
into
something
else
would
be
that
besides
which
there
is
nothing
else
that
truth
is
only
another
name
for
the
positive
state
or
that
the
quest
for
truth
is
the
attempt
to
achieve
positiveness
scientists
who
have
thought
that
they
were
seeking
truth
but
who
were
trying
to
find
out
astronomic
or
chemic
or
biologic
truths
but
truth
is
that
besides
which
there
is
nothing
nothing
to
modify
it
nothing
to
question
it
nothing
to
form
an
exception
the
the
complete
by
truth
i
mean
the
universal
so
chemists
have
sought
the
true
or
the
real
and
have
always
failed
in
their
endeavors
because
of
the
outside
relations
of
chemical
phenomena
have
failed
in
the
sense
that
never
has
a
chemical
law
without
exceptions
been
discovered
because
chemistry
is
continuous
with
astronomy
physics
biology
for
instance
if
the
sun
should
greatly
change
its
distance
from
this
earth
and
if
human
life
could
survive
the
familiar
chemic
formulas
would
no
longer
work
out
a
new
science
of
chemistry
would
have
to
be
learned
or
that
all
attempts
to
find
truth
in
the
special
are
attempts
to
find
the
universal
in
the
local
and
artists
and
their
striving
for
positiveness
under
the
name
of
harmony
but
their
pigments
that
are
oxydizing
or
are
responding
to
a
deranging
environment
or
the
strings
of
musical
instruments
that
are
differently
and
disturbingly
adjusting
to
outside
chemic
and
thermal
and
gravitational
forces
again
and
again
this
oneness
of
all
ideals
and
that
it
is
the
attempt
to
be
or
to
achieve
locally
that
which
is
realizable
only
universally
in
our
experience
there
is
only
intermediateness
to
harmony
and
discord
harmony
is
that
besides
which
there
are
no
outside
forces
and
nations
that
have
fought
with
only
one
motive
for
individuality
or
entity
or
to
be
real
final
nations
not
subordinate
to
or
parts
of
other
nations
and
that
nothing
but
intermediateness
has
ever
been
attained
and
that
history
is
record
of
failures
of
this
one
attempt
because
there
always
have
been
outside
forces
or
other
nations
contending
for
the
same
goal
as
to
physical
things
chemic
mineralogic
astronomic
it
is
not
customary
to
say
that
they
act
to
achieve
truth
or
entity
but
it
is
understood
that
all
motions
are
toward
equilibrium
that
there
is
no
motion
except
toward
equilibrium
of
course
always
away
from
some
other
approximation
to
equilibrium
all
biologic
phenomena
act
to
adjust
there
are
no
biologic
actions
other
than
adjustments
adjustment
is
another
name
for
equilibrium
equilibrium
is
the
universal
or
that
which
has
nothing
external
to
derange
it
but
that
all
that
we
call
being
is
motion
and
that
all
motion
is
the
expression
not
of
equilibrium
but
of
equilibrating
or
of
equilibrium
unattained
that
are
expressions
of
equilibrium
unattained
that
all
thought
relates
to
the
unattained
that
to
have
what
is
called
being
in
our
is
not
to
be
in
the
positive
sense
or
is
to
be
intermediate
to
equilibrium
and
inequilibrium
so
then
that
all
phenomena
in
our
intermediate
state
or
represent
this
one
attempt
to
organize
stabilize
harmonize
individualize
or
to
positivize
or
to
become
real
that
only
to
have
seeming
is
to
express
failure
or
intermediateness
to
final
failure
and
final
success
that
every
attempt
that
is
observable
is
defeated
by
continuity
or
by
outside
forces
or
by
the
excluded
that
are
continuous
with
the
included
that
our
whole
existence
is
an
attempt
by
the
relative
to
be
the
absolute
or
by
the
local
to
be
the
universal
in
this
book
my
interest
is
in
this
attempt
as
manifested
in
modern
science
that
it
has
attempted
to
be
real
true
final
complete
absolute
that
if
the
seeming
of
being
here
in
our
is
the
product
of
exclusion
that
is
always
false
and
arbitrary
if
always
are
included
and
excluded
continuous
the
whole
seeming
system
or
entity
of
modern
science
is
only
or
wrought
by
the
same
false
and
arbitrary
process
as
that
by
which
the
still
less
positive
system
that
preceded
it
or
the
theological
system
wrought
the
illusion
of
its
being
in
this
book
i
assemble
some
of
the
data
that
i
think
are
of
the
falsely
and
arbitrarily
excluded
the
data
of
the
damned
i
have
gone
into
the
outer
darkness
of
scientific
and
philosophical
transactions
and
proceedings
but
covered
with
the
dust
of
disregard
i
have
descended
into
journalism
i
have
come
back
with
the
of
lost
data
they
will
march
as
to
the
logic
of
our
expressions
to
come
that
there
is
only
in
our
mode
of
seeming
that
nothing
ever
has
been
proved
because
there
is
nothing
to
prove
when
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
to
prove
i
mean
that
to
those
who
accept
continuity
or
the
merging
away
of
all
phenomena
into
other
phenomena
without
positive
demarcations
one
from
another
there
is
in
a
positive
sense
no
one
thing
there
is
nothing
to
prove
for
instance
nothing
can
be
proved
to
be
an
animal
because
animalness
and
vegetableness
are
not
positively
different
there
are
some
expressions
of
life
that
are
as
much
vegetable
as
animal
or
that
represent
the
merging
of
animalness
and
vegetableness
there
is
then
no
positive
test
standard
criterion
means
of
forming
an
opinion
as
distinct
from
vegetables
animals
do
not
exist
there
is
nothing
to
prove
nothing
could
be
proved
to
be
good
for
instance
there
is
nothing
in
our
existence
that
is
good
in
a
positive
sense
or
as
really
outlined
from
evil
if
to
forgive
be
good
in
times
of
peace
it
is
evil
in
wartime
there
is
nothing
to
prove
good
in
our
experience
is
continuous
with
or
is
only
another
aspect
of
evil
as
to
what
i
trying
to
do
now
i
accept
only
if
i
ca
see
universally
i
only
localize
so
of
course
then
that
nothing
ever
has
been
proved
that
theological
pronouncements
are
as
much
open
to
doubt
as
ever
they
were
but
that
by
a
hypnotizing
process
they
became
dominant
over
the
majority
of
minds
in
their
era
that
in
a
succeeding
era
the
laws
dogmas
formulas
principles
of
materialistic
science
never
were
proved
because
they
are
only
localizations
simulating
the
universal
but
that
the
leading
minds
of
their
era
of
dominance
were
hypnotized
into
more
or
less
firmly
believing
them
newton
three
laws
and
that
they
are
attempts
to
achieve
positiveness
or
to
defy
and
break
continuity
and
are
as
unreal
as
are
all
other
attempts
to
localize
the
universal
that
if
every
observable
body
is
continuous
mediately
or
immediately
with
all
other
bodies
it
can
not
be
influenced
only
by
its
own
inertia
so
that
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
phenomena
of
inertia
may
be
that
if
all
things
are
reacting
to
an
infinitude
of
forces
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
effects
of
only
one
impressed
force
would
be
that
if
every
reaction
is
continuous
with
its
action
it
can
not
be
conceived
of
as
a
whole
and
that
there
is
no
way
of
conceiving
what
it
might
be
equal
and
opposite
to
or
that
newton
three
laws
are
three
articles
of
faith
or
that
demons
and
angels
and
inertias
and
reactions
are
all
mythological
characters
but
that
in
their
eras
of
dominance
they
were
almost
as
firmly
believed
in
as
if
they
had
been
proved
enormities
and
preposterousnesses
will
march
they
will
be
proved
as
well
as
moses
or
darwin
or
lyell
ever
proved
anything
we
substitute
acceptance
for
belief
cells
of
an
embryo
take
on
different
appearances
in
different
eras
the
more
firmly
established
the
more
difficult
to
change
that
social
organism
is
embryonic
that
firmly
to
believe
is
to
impede
development
that
only
temporarily
to
accept
is
to
facilitate
but
except
that
we
substitute
acceptance
for
belief
our
methods
will
be
the
conventional
methods
the
means
by
which
every
belief
has
been
formulated
and
supported
or
our
methods
will
be
the
methods
of
theologians
and
savages
and
scientists
and
children
because
if
all
phenomena
are
continuous
there
can
be
no
positively
different
methods
by
the
inconclusive
means
and
methods
of
cardinals
and
fortune
tellers
and
evolutionists
and
peasants
methods
which
must
be
inconclusive
if
they
relate
always
to
the
local
and
if
there
is
nothing
local
to
conclude
we
shall
write
this
book
if
it
function
as
an
expression
of
its
era
it
will
prevail
all
sciences
begin
with
attempts
to
define
nothing
ever
has
been
defined
because
there
is
nothing
to
define
darwin
wrote
origin
of
he
was
never
able
to
tell
what
he
meant
by
a
species
it
is
not
possible
to
define
nothing
has
ever
been
finally
found
out
because
there
is
nothing
final
to
find
out
it
like
looking
for
a
needle
that
no
one
ever
lost
in
a
haystack
that
never
was
but
that
all
scientific
attempts
really
to
find
out
something
whereas
really
there
is
nothing
to
find
out
are
attempts
themselves
really
to
be
something
a
seeker
of
truth
he
will
never
find
it
but
the
dimmest
of
possibilities
he
may
himself
become
truth
or
that
science
is
more
than
an
inquiry
that
it
is
a
or
a
that
it
is
an
attempt
to
break
away
and
locally
establish
harmony
stability
equilibrium
consistency
entity
dimmest
of
possibilities
that
it
may
succeed
that
ours
is
a
and
that
all
appearances
in
it
partake
of
its
essential
fictitiousness
but
that
some
appearances
approximate
far
more
highly
to
the
positive
state
than
do
others
we
conceive
of
all
things
as
occupying
gradations
or
steps
in
series
between
positiveness
and
negativeness
or
realness
and
unrealness
that
some
seeming
things
are
more
nearly
consistent
just
beautiful
unified
individual
harmonious
stable
than
others
we
are
not
realists
we
are
not
idealists
we
are
intermediatists
that
nothing
is
real
but
that
nothing
is
unreal
that
all
phenomena
are
approximations
one
way
or
the
other
between
realness
and
unrealness
so
then
that
our
whole
is
an
intermediate
stage
between
positiveness
and
negativeness
or
realness
and
unrealness
like
purgatory
i
think
but
in
our
summing
up
which
was
very
sketchily
done
we
omitted
to
make
clear
that
realness
is
an
aspect
of
the
positive
state
by
realness
i
mean
that
which
does
not
merge
away
into
something
else
and
that
which
is
not
partly
something
else
that
which
is
not
a
reaction
to
or
an
imitation
of
something
else
by
a
real
hero
we
mean
one
who
is
not
partly
a
coward
or
whose
actions
and
motives
do
not
merge
away
into
cowardice
but
if
in
continuity
all
things
do
merge
by
realness
i
mean
the
universal
besides
which
there
is
nothing
with
which
to
merge
that
though
the
local
might
be
universalized
it
is
not
conceivable
that
the
universal
can
be
localized
but
that
high
approximations
there
may
be
and
that
these
approximate
successes
may
be
translated
out
of
intermediateness
into
realness
quite
as
in
a
relative
sense
the
industrial
world
recruits
itself
by
translating
out
of
unrealness
or
out
of
the
seemingly
less
real
imaginings
of
inventors
machines
which
seem
when
set
up
in
factories
to
have
more
of
realness
than
they
had
when
only
imagined
that
all
progress
if
all
progress
is
toward
stability
organization
harmony
consistency
or
positiveness
is
the
attempt
to
become
real
so
then
in
general
metaphysical
terms
our
expression
is
that
like
a
purgatory
all
that
is
commonly
called
existence
which
we
call
intermediateness
is
neither
real
nor
unreal
but
expression
of
attempt
to
become
real
or
to
generate
for
or
recruit
a
real
existence
our
acceptance
is
that
science
though
usually
thought
of
so
specifically
or
in
its
own
local
terms
usually
supposed
to
be
a
prying
into
old
bones
bugs
unsavory
messes
is
an
expression
of
this
one
spirit
animating
all
intermediateness
that
if
science
could
absolutely
exclude
all
data
but
its
own
present
data
or
that
which
is
assimilable
with
the
present
it
would
be
a
real
system
with
positively
definite
outlines
it
would
be
real
its
seeming
approximation
to
consistency
stability
system
positiveness
or
realness
is
sustained
by
damning
the
irreconcilable
or
the
unassimilable
all
would
be
well
all
would
be
heavenly
if
the
damned
would
only
stay
damned
in
the
autumn
of
and
for
years
afterward
occurred
sunsets
such
as
had
never
been
seen
before
within
the
memory
of
all
observers
also
there
were
blue
moons
i
think
that
one
is
likely
to
smile
incredulously
at
the
notion
of
blue
moons
nevertheless
they
were
as
common
as
were
green
suns
in
science
had
to
account
for
these
unconventionalities
such
publications
as
and
were
besieged
with
inquiries
i
suppose
in
alaska
and
in
the
south
sea
islands
all
the
medicine
men
were
similarly
upon
trial
something
had
to
be
thought
of
upon
the
of
august
the
volcano
of
krakatoa
of
the
straits
of
sunda
had
blown
up
terrific
we
told
that
the
sound
was
heard
miles
and
that
persons
were
killed
seems
just
a
little
unscientific
or
impositive
to
me
marvel
to
me
we
not
told
miles
and
persons
the
volume
of
smoke
that
went
up
must
have
been
visible
to
other
planets
or
tormented
with
our
crawlings
and
scurryings
the
earth
complained
to
mars
swore
a
vast
black
oath
at
us
in
all
that
mention
this
occurrence
no
exception
so
far
so
i
have
read
it
is
said
that
the
extraordinary
atmospheric
effects
of
were
first
noticed
in
the
last
of
august
or
the
first
of
september
that
makes
a
difficulty
for
us
it
is
said
that
these
phenomena
were
caused
by
particles
of
volcanic
dust
that
were
cast
high
in
the
air
by
krakatoa
this
is
the
explanation
that
was
agreed
upon
in
but
for
seven
years
the
atmospheric
phenomena
continued
except
that
in
the
seven
there
was
a
lapse
of
several
years
and
where
was
the
volcanic
dust
all
that
time
you
think
that
such
a
question
as
that
would
make
trouble
then
you
have
studied
hypnosis
you
have
never
tried
to
demonstrate
to
a
hypnotic
that
a
table
is
not
a
hippopotamus
according
to
our
general
acceptance
it
would
be
impossible
to
demonstrate
such
a
thing
point
out
a
hundred
reasons
for
saying
that
a
hippopotamus
is
not
a
table
you
have
to
end
up
agreeing
that
neither
is
a
table
a
table
it
only
seems
to
be
a
table
well
that
what
the
hippopotamus
seems
to
be
so
how
can
you
prove
that
something
is
not
something
else
when
neither
is
something
else
some
other
thing
there
nothing
to
prove
this
is
one
of
the
profundities
that
we
advertised
in
advance
you
can
oppose
an
absurdity
only
with
some
other
absurdity
but
science
is
established
preposterousness
we
divide
all
intellection
the
obviously
preposterousness
and
the
established
but
krakatoa
that
the
explanation
that
the
scientists
gave
i
know
what
whopper
the
medicine
men
told
we
see
from
the
start
the
very
strong
inclination
of
science
to
deny
as
much
as
it
can
external
relations
of
this
earth
this
book
is
an
assemblage
of
data
of
external
relations
of
this
earth
we
take
the
position
that
our
data
have
been
damned
upon
no
consideration
for
individual
merits
or
demerits
but
in
conformity
with
a
general
attempt
to
hold
out
for
isolation
of
this
earth
this
is
attempted
positiveness
we
take
the
position
that
science
can
no
more
succeed
than
in
a
similar
endeavor
could
the
chinese
or
than
could
the
united
states
so
then
with
only
of
the
phenomena
of
or
as
an
expression
of
positivism
in
its
aspect
of
isolation
or
unrelatedness
scientists
have
perpetrated
such
an
enormity
as
suspension
of
volcanic
dust
seven
years
in
the
air
disregarding
the
lapse
of
several
years
rather
than
to
admit
the
arrival
of
dust
from
somewhere
beyond
this
earth
not
that
scientists
themselves
have
ever
achieved
positiveness
in
its
aspect
of
unitedness
among
themselves
because
nordenskiold
before
wrote
a
great
deal
upon
his
theory
of
cosmic
dust
and
cleveland
abbe
contended
against
the
krakatoan
explanation
but
that
this
is
the
orthodoxy
of
the
main
body
of
scientists
my
own
chief
reason
for
indignation
here
that
this
preposterous
explanation
interferes
with
some
of
my
own
enormities
it
would
cost
me
too
much
explaining
if
i
should
have
to
admit
that
this
earth
atmosphere
has
such
sustaining
power
later
we
shall
have
data
of
things
that
have
gone
up
in
the
air
and
that
have
stayed
up
somewhere
weeks
months
but
not
by
the
sustaining
power
of
this
earth
atmosphere
for
instance
the
turtle
of
vicksburg
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
think
of
a
turtle
hanging
for
three
or
four
months
upheld
only
by
the
air
over
the
town
of
vicksburg
when
it
comes
to
the
horse
and
the
barn
i
think
that
they
be
classics
some
day
but
i
can
never
accept
that
a
horse
and
a
barn
could
float
several
months
in
this
earth
atmosphere
the
orthodox
explanation
see
the
of
the
krakatoa
committee
of
the
royal
it
comes
out
absolutely
for
the
orthodox
explanation
absolutely
and
beautifully
also
expensively
there
are
pages
in
the
report
and
plates
some
of
them
marvelously
colored
it
was
issued
after
an
investigation
that
took
five
years
you
could
think
of
anything
done
more
efficiently
artistically
authoritatively
the
mathematical
parts
are
especially
impressive
distribution
of
the
dust
of
krakatoa
velocity
of
translation
and
rates
of
subsidence
altitudes
and
persistences
that
the
atmospheric
effects
that
have
been
attributed
to
krakatoa
were
seen
in
trinidad
before
the
eruption
occurred
that
they
were
seen
in
natal
south
africa
six
months
before
the
eruption
inertia
and
its
inhospitality
or
raw
meat
should
not
be
fed
to
babies
we
shall
have
a
few
data
initiatorily
i
fear
me
that
the
horse
and
the
barn
were
a
little
extreme
for
our
budding
liberalities
the
outrageous
is
the
reasonable
if
introduced
politely
hailstones
for
instance
one
reads
in
the
newspapers
of
hailstones
the
size
of
hens
eggs
one
smiles
nevertheless
i
will
engage
to
list
one
hundred
instances
from
the
weather
of
hailstones
the
size
of
hens
eggs
there
is
an
account
in
of
hailstones
that
weighed
almost
two
pounds
each
see
encyclopedia
for
of
the
smithsonian
authenticated
and
reported
at
seringapatam
india
about
the
year
fell
a
hailstone
i
fear
me
i
fear
me
this
is
one
of
the
profoundly
damned
i
blurt
out
something
that
should
perhaps
be
withheld
for
several
hundred
pages
but
that
damned
thing
was
the
size
of
an
elephant
we
laugh
or
snowflakes
size
of
saucers
said
to
have
fallen
at
nashville

of
intellection
i
should
say
that
what
we
call
knowledge
is
ignorance
surrounded
by
laughter
black
rains
red
rains
the
fall
of
a
thousand
tons
of
butter
snow
pink
snow
blue
hailstones
hailstones
flavored
like
oranges
punk
and
silk
and
charcoal
about
one
hundred
years
ago
if
anyone
was
so
credulous
as
to
think
that
stones
had
ever
fallen
from
the
sky
he
was
reasoned
with
in
the
first
place
there
are
no
stones
in
the
sky
therefore
no
stones
can
fall
from
the
sky
or
nothing
more
reasonable
or
scientific
or
logical
than
that
could
be
said
upon
any
subject
the
only
trouble
is
the
universal
trouble
that
the
major
premise
is
not
real
or
is
intermediate
somewhere
between
realness
and
unrealness
in
a
committee
of
whom
lavoisier
was
a
member
was
appointed
by
the
french
academy
to
investigate
a
report
that
a
stone
had
fallen
from
the
sky
at
luce
france
of
all
attempts
at
positiveness
in
its
aspect
of
isolation
i
do
know
of
anything
that
has
been
fought
harder
for
than
the
notion
of
this
earth
unrelatedness
lavoisier
analyzed
the
stone
of
luce
the
exclusionists
explanation
at
that
time
was
that
stones
do
not
fall
from
the
sky
that
luminous
objects
may
seem
to
fall
and
that
hot
stones
may
be
picked
up
where
a
luminous
object
seemingly
had
landed
only
lightning
striking
a
stone
heating
even
melting
it
the
stone
of
luce
showed
signs
of
fusion
lavoisier
analysis
absolutely
proved
that
this
stone
had
not
fallen
that
it
had
been
struck
by
lightning
so
authoritatively
falling
stones
were
damned
the
stock
means
of
exclusion
remained
the
explanation
of
lightning
that
was
seen
to
strike
something
that
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
but
positiveness
and
the
fate
of
every
positive
statement
it
is
not
customary
to
think
of
damned
stones
raising
an
outcry
against
a
sentence
of
exclusion
but
subjectively
aerolites
did
or
data
of
them
bombarded
the
walls
raised
against
them
the
phenomenon
which
is
the
subject
of
the
remarks
before
us
will
seem
to
most
persons
as
little
worthy
of
credit
as
any
that
could
be
offered
the
falling
of
large
stones
from
the
sky
without
any
assignable
cause
of
their
previous
ascent
seems
to
partake
so
much
of
the
marvelous
as
almost
entirely
to
exclude
the
operation
of
known
and
natural
agents
yet
a
body
of
evidence
is
here
brought
to
prove
that
such
events
have
actually
taken
place
and
we
ought
not
to
withhold
from
it
a
proper
degree
of
attention
the
writer
abandons
the
first
or
absolute
exclusion
and
modifies
it
with
the
explanation
that
the
day
before
a
reported
fall
of
stones
in
tuscany
june
there
had
been
an
eruption
of
vesuvius
or
that
stones
do
fall
from
the
sky
but
that
they
are
stones
that
have
been
raised
to
the
sky
from
some
other
part
of
the
earth
surface
by
whirlwinds
or
by
volcanic
action
it
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
later
i
know
of
no
aerolite
that
has
ever
been
acceptably
traced
to
terrestrial
origin
falling
stones
had
to
be
undamned
though
still
with
a
reservation
that
held
out
for
exclusion
of
outside
forces
one
may
have
the
knowledge
of
a
lavoisier
and
still
not
be
able
to
analyze
not
be
able
even
to
see
except
conformably
with
the
hypnoses
or
the
conventional
reactions
against
hypnoses
of
one
era
we
believe
no
more
we
accept
little
by
little
the
whirlwind
and
volcano
explanations
had
to
be
abandoned
but
so
powerful
was
this
sentence
of
damnation
or
this
attempt
at
positiveness
that
far
into
our
own
times
some
scientists
notably
lawrence
smith
and
sir
robert
ball
continued
to
hold
out
against
all
external
origins
asserting
that
nothing
could
fall
to
this
earth
unless
it
had
been
cast
up
or
whirled
up
from
some
other
part
of
this
earth
surface
it
as
commendable
as
anything
ever
has
been
by
which
i
mean
intermediate
to
the
commendable
and
the
censurable
it
virginal
meteorites
data
of
which
were
once
of
the
damned
have
been
admitted
but
the
common
impression
of
them
is
only
a
retreat
of
attempted
exclusion
that
only
two
kinds
of
substance
fall
from
the
sky
metallic
and
stony
that
the
metallic
objects
are
of
iron
and
nickel
butter
and
paper
and
wool
and
silk
and
resin
we
see
to
start
with
that
the
virgins
of
science
have
fought
and
wept
and
screamed
against
external
relations
upon
two
grounds
there
in
the
first
place
or
up
from
one
part
of
this
earth
surface
and
down
to
another
as
late
as
november
in
a
member
of
the
selborne
society
still
argued
that
meteorites
do
not
fall
from
the
sky
that
they
are
masses
of
iron
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
that
attract
lightning
that
the
lightning
is
seen
and
is
mistaken
for
a
falling
luminous
object
by
progress
we
mean
rape
butter
and
beef
and
blood
and
a
stone
with
strange
inscriptions
upon
it
so
then
it
is
our
expression
that
science
relates
to
real
knowledge
no
more
than
does
the
growth
of
a
plant
or
the
organization
of
a
department
store
or
the
development
of
a
nation
that
all
are
assimilative
or
organizing
or
systematizing
processes
that
represent
different
attempts
to
attain
the
positive
state
the
state
commonly
called
heaven
i
suppose
i
mean
there
can
be
no
real
science
where
there
are
indeterminate
variables
but
every
variable
is
in
finer
terms
indeterminate
or
irregular
if
only
to
have
the
appearance
of
being
in
intermediateness
is
to
express
regularity
unattained
the
invariable
or
the
real
and
stable
would
be
nothing
at
all
in
intermediateness
rather
as
but
in
relative
terms
an
undistorted
interpretation
of
external
sounds
in
the
mind
of
a
dreamer
could
not
continue
to
exist
in
a
dreaming
mind
because
that
touch
of
relative
realness
would
be
of
awakening
and
not
of
dreaming
science
is
the
attempt
to
awaken
to
realness
wherein
it
is
attempt
to
find
regularity
and
uniformity
or
the
regular
and
uniform
would
be
that
which
has
nothing
external
to
disturb
it
by
the
universal
we
mean
the
real
or
the
notion
is
that
the
underlying
as
expressed
in
science
is
indifferent
to
the
of
science
that
the
attempt
to
regularize
is
the
vital
spirit
bugs
and
stars
and
chemical
messes
that
they
are
only
and
that
of
them
there
is
nothing
real
to
know
but
that
systematization
of
is
approximation
to
realness
or
final
awakening
or
a
dreaming
mind
and
its
centaurs
and
canary
birds
that
turn
into
giraffes
there
could
be
no
real
biology
upon
such
subjects
but
attempt
in
a
dreaming
mind
to
systematize
such
appearances
would
be
movement
toward
awakening
if
better
mental
is
all
that
we
mean
by
the
state
of
being
awake
relatively
awake
so
it
is
that
having
attempted
to
systematize
by
ignoring
externality
to
the
greatest
possible
degree
the
notion
of
things
dropping
in
upon
this
earth
from
externality
is
as
unsettling
and
as
unwelcome
to
science
as
tin
horns
blowing
in
upon
a
musician
relatively
symmetric
composition
flies
alighting
upon
a
painter
attempted
harmony
and
tracking
colors
one
into
another
suffragist
getting
up
and
making
a
political
speech
at
a
prayer
meeting
if
all
things
are
of
a
oneness
which
is
a
state
intermediate
to
unrealness
and
realness
and
if
nothing
has
succeeded
in
breaking
away
and
establishing
entity
for
itself
and
could
not
continue
to
exist
in
intermediateness
if
it
should
succeed
any
more
than
could
the
born
still
at
the
same
time
be
the
uterine
i
of
course
know
of
no
positive
difference
between
science
and
christian
science
and
the
attitude
of
both
toward
the
unwelcome
is
the
same
it
does
not
exist
a
lord
kelvin
and
a
eddy
and
something
not
to
their
liking
it
does
not
exist
of
course
not
we
intermediates
say
but
also
that
in
intermediateness
neither
is
there
absolute
or
a
christian
scientist
and
a
toothache
neither
exists
in
the
final
sense
also
neither
is
absolutely
and
according
to
our
therapeutics
the
one
that
more
highly
approximates
to
realness
will
win
a
secret
of
power
i
think
it
another
profundity
do
you
want
power
over
something
be
more
nearly
real
than
it
we
begin
with
yellow
substances
that
have
fallen
upon
this
earth
we
see
whether
our
data
of
them
have
a
higher
approximation
to
realness
than
have
the
dogmas
of
those
who
deny
their
existence
that
is
as
products
from
somewhere
external
to
this
earth
in
mere
impressionism
we
take
our
stand
we
have
no
positive
tests
nor
standards
realism
in
art
realism
in
science
they
pass
away
in
the
thing
to
do
was
to
accept
darwinism
now
many
biologists
are
revolting
and
trying
to
conceive
of
something
else
the
thing
to
do
was
to
accept
it
in
its
day
but
darwinism
of
course
was
never
proved
the
fittest
survive
what
is
meant
by
the
fittest
not
the
strongest
not
the
cleverest
weakness
and
stupidity
everywhere
survive
there
is
no
way
of
determining
fitness
except
in
that
a
thing
does
survive
fitness
then
is
only
another
name
for
survival
darwinism
that
survivors
survive
although
darwinism
then
seems
positively
baseless
or
absolutely
irrational
its
massing
of
supposed
data
and
its
attempted
coherence
approximate
more
highly
to
organization
and
consistency
than
did
the
inchoate
speculations
that
preceded
it
or
that
columbus
never
proved
that
the
earth
is
round
shadow
of
the
earth
on
the
moon
no
one
has
ever
seen
it
in
its
entirety
the
earth
shadow
is
much
larger
than
the
moon
if
the
periphery
of
the
shadow
is
curved
but
the
convex
moon
a
object
will
cast
a
curved
shadow
upon
a
surface
that
is
convex
all
the
other
proofs
may
be
taken
up
in
the
same
way
it
was
impossible
for
columbus
to
prove
that
the
earth
is
round
it
was
not
required
only
that
with
a
higher
seeming
of
positiveness
than
that
of
his
opponents
he
should
attempt
the
thing
to
do
in
was
nevertheless
to
accept
that
beyond
europe
to
the
west
were
other
lands
i
offer
for
acceptance
as
something
concordant
with
the
spirit
of
this
first
quarter
of
the
century
the
expression
that
beyond
this
earth
are
other
lands
from
which
come
things
as
from
america
float
things
to
europe
as
to
yellow
substances
that
have
fallen
upon
this
earth
the
endeavor
to
exclude
origins
is
the
dogma
that
all
yellow
rains
and
yellow
snows
are
colored
with
pollen
from
this
earth
pine
trees
meteorological
is
especially
prudish
in
this
respect
and
regards
as
highly
improper
all
advances
made
by
other
explainers
nevertheless
the
weather
may
reports
a
fall
of
at
peckloh
germany
in
which
four
kinds
of
organisms
not
pollen
were
the
coloring
matter
there
were
minute
things
shaped
like
arrows
coffee
beans
horns
and
disks
they
may
have
been
symbols
they
may
have
been
objective
hieroglyphics
mere
passing
fancy
let
it
go
in
the
de
there
is
a
list
of
rains
said
to
have
contained
sulphur
i
have
thirty
or
forty
other
notes
i
not
use
one
of
them
i
admit
that
every
one
of
them
is
upon
a
fall
of
pollen
i
said
to
begin
with
that
our
methods
would
be
the
methods
of
theologians
and
scientists
and
they
always
begin
with
an
appearance
of
liberality
i
grant
thirty
or
forty
points
to
start
with
i
as
liberal
as
any
of
them
or
that
my
liberality
wo
cost
me
anything
the
enormousness
of
the
data
that
we
shall
have
or
just
to
look
over
a
typical
instance
of
this
dogma
and
the
way
it
works
out
in
the
journal
of
we
are
told
of
a
yellow
substance
that
fell
by
the
bucketful
upon
a
vessel
one
windless
night
in
june
in
pictou
harbor
nova
scotia
the
writer
analyzed
the
substance
and
it
was
found
to
give
off
nitrogen
and
ammonia
and
an
animal
odor
now
one
of
our
intermediatist
principles
to
start
with
is
that
so
far
from
positive
in
the
aspect
of
homogeneousness
are
all
substances
that
at
least
in
what
is
called
an
elementary
sense
anything
can
be
found
anywhere
mahogany
logs
on
the
coast
of
greenland
bugs
of
a
valley
on
the
top
of
mt
blanc
atheists
at
a
prayer
meeting
ice
in
india
for
instance
chemical
analysis
can
reveal
that
almost
any
dead
man
was
poisoned
with
arsenic
we
say
because
there
is
no
stomach
without
some
iron
lead
tin
gold
arsenic
in
it
and
of
it
which
of
course
in
a
broader
sense
does
matter
much
because
a
certain
number
of
persons
must
as
a
restraining
influence
be
executed
for
murder
every
year
and
if
detectives
are
able
really
to
detect
anything
illusion
of
their
success
is
all
that
is
necessary
and
it
is
very
honorable
to
give
up
one
life
for
society
as
a
whole
the
chemist
who
analyzed
the
substance
of
pictou
sent
a
sample
to
the
editor
of
the
the
editor
of
course
found
pollen
in
it
my
own
acceptance
is
that
there
have
to
be
some
pollen
in
it
that
nothing
could
very
well
fall
through
the
air
in
june
near
the
pine
forests
of
nova
scotia
and
escape
all
floating
spores
of
pollen
but
the
editor
does
not
say
that
this
substance
contained
pollen
he
disregards
nitrogen
ammonia
and
an
animal
odor
and
says
that
the
substance
was
pollen
for
the
sake
of
our
thirty
or
forty
tokens
of
liberality
or
if
we
ca
be
really
liberal
we
grant
that
the
chemist
of
the
first
examination
probably
would
know
an
animal
odor
if
he
were
janitor
of
a
menagerie
as
we
go
along
however
there
can
be
no
such
sweeping
ignoring
of
this
phenomenon
the
fall
of
from
the
sky
i
suggest
to
start
with
that
we
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
fishes
how
would
they
account
for
the
fall
of
from
above
they
would
try
or
it
easy
enough
to
think
of
most
of
us
as
fishes
of
a
kind
franklin
that
upon
the
of
february
there
fell
at
genoa
italy
according
to
director
boccardo
of
the
technical
institute
of
genoa
and
castellani
a
yellow
substance
but
the
microscope
revealed
numerous
globules
of
cobalt
blue
also
corpuscles
of
a
pearly
color
that
resembled
starch
see
bouis
says
of
a
substance
reddish
varying
to
yellowish
that
fell
enormously
and
successively
or
upon
april
may
and
may
in
france
and
spain
that
it
carbonized
and
spread
the
odor
of
charred
animal
matter
that
it
was
not
pollen
that
in
alcohol
it
left
a
residue
of
resinous
matter
hundreds
of
thousands
of
tons
of
this
matter
must
have
fallen
odor
of
charred
animal
matter
or
an
aerial
battle
that
occurred
in
space
several
hundred
years
ago
effect
of
time
in
making
diverse
remains
uniform
in
appearance
it
all
very
absurd
because
even
though
we
are
told
of
a
prodigious
quantity
of
animal
matter
that
fell
from
the
sky
three
days
france
and
spain
we
not
ready
yet
that
all
bouis
says
that
this
substance
was
not
pollen
the
vastness
of
the
fall
makes
acceptable
that
it
was
not
pollen
still
the
resinous
residue
does
suggest
pollen
of
pine
trees
we
shall
hear
a
great
deal
of
a
substance
with
a
resinous
residue
that
has
fallen
from
the
sky
finally
we
shall
divorce
it
from
all
suggestion
of
pollen
a
yellow
powder
that
fell
at
gerace
calabria
march
some
of
this
substance
was
collected
by
sig
simenini
professor
of
chemistry
at
naples
it
had
an
earthy
insipid
taste
and
is
described
as
unctuous
when
heated
this
matter
turned
brown
then
black
then
red
according
to
the
of
one
of
the
components
was
a
substance
which
when
dried
was
found
to
be
resinous
but
concomitants
of
this
fall
loud
noises
were
heard
in
the
sky
stones
fell
from
the
sky
according
to
chladni
these
concomitants
occurred
and
to
me
they
seem
rather
brutal
or
not
associable
with
something
so
soft
and
gentle
as
a
fall
of
pollen
black
rains
and
black
snows
rains
as
black
as
a
deluge
of
ink
snowflakes
such
a
rain
as
that
which
fell
in
ireland
may
described
in
the
of
scientific
and
the
it
fell
upon
a
district
of
square
miles
and
was
the
color
of
ink
and
of
a
fetid
odor
and
very
disagreeable
taste
the
rain
at
castlecommon
ireland
april
thick
black
rain
met
a
black
rain
fell
in
ireland
and
met
it
left
a
most
peculiar
and
disagreeable
smell
in
the
air
the
orthodox
explanation
of
this
rain
occurs
in
march
cloud
of
soot
that
had
come
from
south
wales
crossing
the
irish
channel
and
all
of
ireland
so
the
black
rain
of
ireland
of
march
ascribed
in
met
to
clouds
of
soot
from
the
manufacturing
towns
of
north
england
and
south
scotland
our
intermediatist
principle
of
or
our
principle
of
continuity
is
of
course
that
nothing
is
unique
or
individual
that
all
phenomena
merge
away
into
all
other
phenomena
that
for
instance
suppose
there
should
be
vast
celestial
or
vessels
that
come
near
this
earth
and
discharge
volumes
of
smoke
at
times
we
only
supposing
such
a
thing
as
that
now
because
conventionally
we
are
beginning
modestly
and
tentatively
but
if
it
were
so
there
would
necessarily
be
some
phenomenon
upon
this
earth
with
which
that
phenomenon
would
merge
smoke
and
smoke
from
cities
merge
or
both
would
manifest
in
black
precipitations
in
rain
in
continuity
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
phenomena
at
their
so
we
look
for
them
at
their
extremes
impossible
to
distinguish
between
animal
and
vegetable
in
some
infusoria
but
hippopotamus
and
violet
for
all
practical
purposes
distinguishable
enough
no
one
but
a
barnum
or
a
bailey
would
send
one
a
bunch
of
hippopotami
as
a
token
of
regard
so
away
from
the
great
manufacturing
centers
black
rain
in
switzerland
switzerland
is
so
remote
and
so
ill
at
ease
is
the
conventional
explanation
here
that
says
of
this
rain
that
in
certain
conditions
of
weather
snow
may
take
on
an
appearance
of
blackness
that
is
quite
deceptive
may
be
so
or
at
night
if
dark
enough
snow
may
look
black
this
is
simply
denying
that
a
black
rain
fell
in
switzerland
extreme
remoteness
from
great
manufacturing
centers
that
there
fell
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
a
rain
so
black
as
to
be
described
as
a
shower
of
ink
continuity
dogs
us
continuity
rules
us
and
pulls
us
back
we
seemed
to
have
a
little
hope
that
by
the
method
of
extremes
we
could
get
away
from
things
that
merge
indistinguishably
into
other
things
we
find
that
every
departure
from
one
merger
is
entrance
upon
another
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
vast
volumes
of
smoke
from
great
manufacturing
centers
as
an
explanation
can
not
very
acceptably
merge
with
the
explanation
of
origin
but
smoke
from
a
terrestrial
volcano
can
and
that
is
the
suggestion
that
is
made
in
there
is
in
human
intellection
no
real
standard
to
judge
by
but
our
acceptance
for
the
present
is
that
the
more
nearly
positive
will
prevail
by
the
more
nearly
positive
we
mean
the
more
nearly
organized
everything
merges
away
into
everything
else
but
proportionately
to
its
complexity
if
unified
a
thing
seems
strong
real
and
distinct
so
in
aesthetics
it
is
recognized
that
diversity
in
unity
is
higher
beauty
or
approximation
to
beauty
than
is
simpler
unity
so
the
logicians
feel
that
agreement
of
diverse
data
constitute
greater
convincingness
or
strength
than
that
of
mere
parallel
instances
so
to
herbert
spencer
the
more
highly
differentiated
and
integrated
is
the
more
fully
evolved
our
opponents
hold
out
for
mundane
origin
of
all
black
rains
our
method
will
be
the
presenting
of
diverse
phenomena
in
agreement
with
the
notion
of
some
other
origin
we
take
up
not
only
black
rains
but
black
rains
and
their
accompanying
phenomena
a
correspondent
to
writes
of
a
black
rain
that
fell
in
the
clyde
valley
march
of
another
black
rain
that
fell
two
days
later
according
to
the
correspondent
a
black
rain
had
fallen
in
the
clyde
valley
march
then
again
march
according
to
a
black
rain
fell
at
marlsford
england
more
than
hours
later
another
black
rain
fell
in
the
same
small
town
the
black
rains
of
slains
according
to
rev
james
rust
a
black
rain
at
slains
another
at
carluke
miles
from
slains
may
at
slains
may
slains
but
after
two
of
these
showers
vast
quantities
of
a
substance
described
sometimes
as
pumice
stone
but
sometimes
as
slag
were
washed
upon
the
sea
coast
near
slains
a
chemist
opinion
is
given
that
this
substance
was
slag
that
it
was
not
a
volcanic
product
slag
from
smelting
works
we
now
have
for
black
rains
a
concomitant
that
is
irreconcilable
with
origin
from
factory
chimneys
whatever
it
may
have
been
the
quantity
of
this
substance
was
so
enormous
that
in
opinion
to
have
produced
so
much
of
it
would
have
required
the
united
output
of
all
the
smelting
works
in
the
world
if
slag
it
were
we
accept
that
an
artificial
product
has
in
enormous
quantities
fallen
from
the
sky
if
you
do
think
that
such
occurrences
are
damned
by
science
read
and
see
how
impossible
it
was
for
the
author
to
have
this
matter
taken
up
by
the
scientific
world
the
first
and
second
rains
corresponded
in
time
with
ordinary
ebullitions
of
vesuvius
the
third
and
fourth
according
to
rust
corresponded
with
no
known
volcanic
activities
upon
this
earth
science
pour
that
between
october
and
january
four
more
black
rains
fell
at
slains
scotland
the
writer
of
this
supplementary
account
tells
us
with
a
better
or
more
unscrupulous
orthodoxy
than
rust
that
of
the
eight
black
rains
five
coincided
with
eruptions
of
vesuvius
and
three
with
eruptions
of
etna
the
fate
of
all
explanation
is
to
close
one
door
only
to
have
another
fly
wide
open
i
should
say
that
my
own
notions
upon
this
subject
will
be
considered
irrational
but
at
least
my
gregariousness
is
satisfied
in
associating
here
with
the
preposterous
or
this
writer
and
those
who
think
in
his
rut
have
to
say
that
they
can
think
of
four
discharges
from
one
volcano
passing
over
a
great
part
of
europe
precipitating
nowhere
else
discharging
precisely
over
one
small
northern
parish
but
also
of
three
other
discharges
from
another
volcano
showing
the
same
precise
preference
if
not
marksmanship
for
one
small
parish
in
scotland
nor
would
orthodoxy
be
any
better
off
in
thinking
of
exploding
meteorites
and
their
d√©bris
preciseness
and
recurrence
would
be
just
as
difficult
to
explain
my
own
notion
is
of
an
island
near
an
oceanic
it
might
receive
d√©bris
from
passing
vessels
seven
times
in
four
years

to
there
were
earthquakes
in

at
this

the
black

this
time
it
is
orthodoxy
to
attribute
the
black
precipitate
to
smoke
of
forest
fires
south
of
the
ohio
river
zurcher
that
this
black
rain
was
accompanied
by
shocks
like
those
of
an
earthquake

that
the
earthquake
had
occurred
at
the
climax

and
the
fall
of

red

orthodoxy
sand
blown
by
the
sirocco
from
the
sahara
to
europe
especially
in
the
earthquake
regions
of
europe
there
have
been
many
falls
of
red
substance
usually
but
not
always
precipitated
in
rain
upon
many
occasions
these
substances
have
been
absolutely
identified
as
sand
from
the
sahara
when
i
first
took
this
matter
up
i
came
across
assurance
after
assurance
so
positive
to
this
effect
that
had
i
not
been
an
intermediatist
i
have
looked
no
further
samples
collected
from
a
rain
at
genoa
samples
of
sand
forwarded
from
the
sahara
absolute
agreement
some
writers
said
same
color
same
particles
of
quartz
even
the
same
shells
of
diatoms
mixed
in
then
the
chemical
analyses
not
a
disagreement
worth
mentioning
our
intermediatist
means
of
expression
will
be
that
with
proper
exclusions
after
the
scientific
or
theological
method
anything
can
be
identified
with
anything
else
if
all
things
are
only
different
expressions
of
an
underlying
oneness
to
many
minds
there
rest
and
there
satisfaction
in
that
expression
absolutely
identified
absoluteness
or
the
illusion
of
it
the
universal
quest
if
chemists
have
identified
substances
that
have
fallen
in
europe
as
sand
from
african
deserts
swept
up
in
african
whirlwinds
that
assuasive
to
all
the
irritations
that
occur
to
those
cloistered
minds
that
must
repose
in
the
concept
of
a
snug
isolated
little
world
free
from
contact
with
cosmic
wickednesses
safe
from
stellar
guile
undisturbed
by
prowlings
and
invasions
the
only
trouble
is
that
a
chemist
analysis
which
seems
so
final
and
authoritative
to
some
minds
is
no
more
nearly
absolute
than
is
identification
by
a
child
or
description
by
an
imbecile
i
take
some
of
that
back
i
accept
that
the
approximation
is
higher
but
that
it
based
upon
delusion
because
there
is
no
definiteness
no
homogeneity
no
stability
only
different
stages
somewhere
between
them
and
indefiniteness
heterogeneity
and
instability
there
are
no
chemical
elements
it
seems
acceptable
that
ramsay
and
others
have
settled
that
the
chemical
elements
are
only
another
disappointment
in
the
quest
for
the
positive
as
the
definite
the
homogeneous
and
the
stable
if
there
were
real
elements
there
could
be
a
real
science
of
chemistry
upon
and
occurred
the
greatest
fall
of
matter
in
the
history
of
australia
upon
the
of
november
it
rained
mud
in
tasmania
it
was
of
course
attributed
to
australian
whirlwinds
but
according
to
the
weather
there
was
a
haze
all
the
way
to
the
philippines
also
as
far
as
hong
kong
it
may
be
that
this
phenomenon
had
no
especial
relation
with
the
even
more
tremendous
fall
of
matter
that
occurred
in
europe
february
for
several
days
the
south
of
england
was
a
dumping
ground
from
somewhere
if
you
like
to
have
a
chemist
opinion
even
though
it
only
a
chemist
opinion
see
the
report
of
the
meeting
of
the
royal
chemical
society
april
clayton
read
a
paper
upon
some
of
the
substance
that
had
fallen
from
the
sky
collected
by
him
the
sahara
explanation
applies
mostly
to
falls
that
occur
in
southern
europe
farther
away
the
conventionalists
are
a
little
uneasy
for
instance
the
editor
of
the
weather
says
of
a
red
rain
that
fell
near
the
coast
of
newfoundland
early
in
it
would
be
very
remarkable
if
this
was
sahara
dust
clayton
said
that
the
matter
examined
by
him
was
merely
dust
from
the
roads
and
lanes
of
wessex
this
opinion
is
typical
of
all
scientific
opinion
or
theological
opinion
or
feminine
opinion
all
very
well
except
for
what
it
disregards
the
most
charitable
thing
i
can
think
of
because
i
think
it
gives
us
a
broader
tone
to
relieve
our
malices
with
occasional
charities
is
that
clayton
had
not
heard
of
the
astonishing
extent
of
this
fall
had
covered
the
canary
islands
on
the
for
instance
i
think
myself
that
in
we
passed
through
the
remains
of
a
powdered
world
left
over
from
an
ancient
dispute
brooding
in
space
like
a
red
resentment
ever
since
or
like
every
other
opinion
the
notion
of
dust
from
wessex
turns
into
a
provincial
thing
when
we
look
it
over
to
think
is
to
conceive
incompletely
because
all
thought
relates
only
to
the
local
we
metaphysicians
of
course
like
to
have
the
notion
that
we
think
of
the
unthinkable
as
to
opinions
or
pronouncements
i
should
say
because
they
always
have
such
an
authoritative
air
of
other
chemists
there
is
an
analysis
in
giving
water
and
organic
matter
at
per
cent
it
that
carrying
out
of
fractions
that
so
convincing
the
substance
is
identified
as
sand
from
the
sahara
the
vastness
of
this
fall
in
we
are
told
that
it
had
occurred
in
ireland
too
the
sahara
of
course
because
prior
to
february
there
had
been
dust
storms
in
the
sahara
disregarding
that
in
that
great
region
there
always
in
some
part
of
it
a
dust
storm
however
just
at
present
it
does
look
reasonable
that
dust
had
come
from
africa
via
the
canaries
the
great
difficulty
that
authoritativeness
has
to
contend
with
is
some
other
authoritativeness
when
an
infallibility
clashes
with
a
pontification
they
explain
march
another
analysis
per
cent
organic
matter
such
disagreements
do
look
very
well
so
in
one
of
the
differing
chemists
explains
he
says
that
his
analysis
was
of
muddy
rain
and
the
other
was
of
sediment
of
rain
we
quite
ready
to
accept
excuses
from
the
most
high
though
i
do
wonder
whether
we
quite
so
damned
as
we
were
if
we
find
ourselves
in
a
gracious
and
tolerant
mood
toward
the
powers
that
condemn
but
the
tax
that
now
comes
upon
our
good
manners
and
unwillingness
to
be
too
severe
another
chemist
he
says
it
was
per
cent
water
and
organic
matter
he
identifies
this
matter
as
sand
from
an
african
desert
but
after
deducting
organic
matter
but
you
and
i
could
be
identified
as
sand
from
an
african
desert
after
deducting
all
there
is
to
us
except
sand
why
we
can
not
accept
that
this
fall
was
of
sand
from
the
sahara
omitting
the
obvious
objection
that
in
most
parts
the
sahara
is
not
red
at
all
but
is
usually
described
as
dazzling
white
the
enormousness
of
it
that
a
whirlwind
might
have
carried
it
but
that
in
that
case
it
would
be
no
supposititious
or
doubtfully
identified
whirlwind
but
the
greatest
atmospheric
cataclysm
in
the
history
of
this
earth
roy
met
that
up
to
the
of
february
this
fall
had
continued
in
belgium
holland
germany
and
austria
that
in
some
instances
it
was
not
sand
or
that
almost
all
the
matter
was
organic
that
a
vessel
had
reported
the
fall
as
occurring
in
the
atlantic
ocean
midway
between
southampton
and
the
barbados
the
calculation
is
given
that
in
england
alone
tons
of
matter
had
fallen
it
had
fallen
in
switzerland
met
march
it
had
fallen
in
russia
com
not
only
had
a
vast
quantity
of
matter
fallen
several
months
before
in
australia
but
it
was
at
this
time
falling
in
australia
june
enormously
red
mud
fifty
tons
per
square
mile
the
wessex
explanation
or
that
every
explanation
is
a
wessex
explanation
by
that
i
mean
an
attempt
to
interpret
the
enormous
in
terms
of
the
minute
but
that
nothing
can
be
finally
explained
because
by
truth
we
mean
the
universal
and
that
even
if
we
could
think
as
wide
as
universality
that
would
not
be
requital
to
the
cosmic
quest
which
is
not
for
truth
but
for
the
local
that
is
true
not
to
universalize
the
local
but
to
localize
the
universal
or
to
give
to
a
cosmic
cloud
absolute
interpretation
in
terms
of
the
little
dusty
roads
and
lanes
of
wessex
i
can
not
conceive
that
this
can
be
done
i
think
of
high
approximation
our
intermediatist
concept
is
that
because
of
the
continuity
of
all
things
which
are
not
separate
positive
or
real
things
all
partake
of
the
underlying
or
are
only
different
expressions
degrees
or
aspects
of
the
underlying
so
then
that
a
sample
from
somewhere
in
anything
must
correspond
with
a
sample
from
somewhere
in
anything
else
that
by
due
care
in
selection
and
disregard
for
everything
else
or
the
scientific
and
theological
method
the
substance
that
fell
february
could
be
identified
with
anything
or
with
some
part
or
aspect
of
anything
that
could
be
conceived
of
with
sand
from
the
sahara
sand
from
a
barrel
of
sugar
or
dust
of
your
different
samples
are
described
and
listed
in
the
of
the
royal
meteorological
or
we
see
whether
my
notion
that
a
chemist
could

or
there
could
be
real
science
if
there
were
really
anything
to
be
scientific
about
or
the
science
of
chemistry
is
like
a
science
of
sociology
prejudiced
in
advance
because
only
to
see
is
to
see
with
a
prejudice
setting
out
to
prove
that
all
inhabitants
of
new

came
from
africa
very
easy
matter
samples
from
one
part
of
town
disregard
for
all
the
rest
there
is
no
science
but
according
to
our
acceptance
there
should
be
no
other
but
that
approximation
should
be
higher
that
metaphysics
is
that
the
scientific
spirit
is
of
the
cosmic
quest
our
notion
is
that
in
a
real
existence
such
a
of
fables
as
the
science
of
chemistry
could
not
deceive
for
a
moment
but
that
in
an
existence
endeavoring
to
become
real
it
represents
that
endeavor
and
will
continue
to
impose
its
until
it
be
driven
out
by
a
higher
approximation
to
realness
that
the
science
of
chemistry
is
as
impositive
as
or
no
that
though
it
represents
a
higher
approximation
to
realness
than
does
alchemy
for
instance
and
so
drove
out
alchemy
it
is
still
only
somewhere
between
myth
and
positiveness
the
attempt
at
realness
or
to
state
a
real
and
unmodified
fact
here
is
the
statement
all
red
rains
are
colored
by
sands
from
the
sahara
desert
my
own
impositivist
acceptances
are
that
some
red
rains
are
colored
by
sands
from
the
sahara
desert
some
by
sands
from
other
terrestrial
sources
some
by
sands
from
other
worlds
or
from
their
deserts
also
from
aerial
regions
too
indefinite
or
amorphous
to
be
thought
of
as
worlds
or
planets
that
no
supposititious
whirlwind
can
account
for
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
tons
of
matter
that
fell
upon
australia
pacific
ocean
and
atlantic
ocean
and
europe
in
and
that
a
whirlwind
that
could
do
that
would
not
be
supposititious
but
now
we
shall
cast
off
some
of
our
own
wessicality
by
accepting
that
there
have
been
falls
of
red
substance
other
than
sand
we
regard
every
science
as
an
expression
of
the
attempt
to
be
real
but
to
be
real
is
to
localize
the
universal
or
to
make
some
one
thing
as
wide
as
all
things
successful
accomplishment
of
which
i
can
not
conceive
of
the
prime
resistance
to
this
endeavor
is
the
refusal
of
the
rest
of
the
universe
to
be
damned
excluded
disregarded
to
receive
christian
science
treatment
by
something
else
so
attempting
although
all
phenomena
are
striving
for
the
absolute
or
have
surrendered
to
and
have
incorporated
themselves
in
higher
attempts
simply
to
be
phenomenal
or
to
have
seeming
in
intermediateness
is
to
express
relations
a
river
it
is
water
expressing
the
gravitational
relation
of
different
levels
the
water
of
the
river
expression
of
chemic
relations
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
which
are
not
final
a
city
manifestation
of
commercial
and
social
relations
how
could
a
mountain
be
without
base
in
a
greater
body
storekeeper
live
without
customers
the
prime
resistance
to
the
positivist
attempt
by
science
is
its
relations
with
other
phenomena
or
that
it
only
expresses
those
relations
in
the
first
place
or
that
a
science
can
have
seeming
or
survive
in
intermediateness
as
something
pure
isolated
positively
different
no
more
than
could
a
river
or
a
city
or
a
mountain
or
a
store
this
attempt
by
parts
to
be
wholes
which
can
not
be
realized
in
our
if
we
accept
that
in
it
the
of
two
or
more
wholes
or
universals
is
impossible
high
approximation
to
which
however
may
be
thinkable
scientists
and
their
dream
of
pure
science
artists
and
their
dream
of
art
for
art
sake
it
is
our
notion
that
if
they
could
almost
realize
that
would
be
almost
realness
that
they
would
instantly
be
translated
into
real
existence
such
thinkers
are
good
positivists
but
they
are
evil
in
an
economic
and
sociologic
sense
if
in
that
sense
nothing
has
justification
for
being
unless
it
serve
or
function
for
or
express
the
relations
of
some
higher
aggregate
so
science
functions
for
and
serves
society
at
large
and
would
from
society
at
large
receive
no
support
unless
it
did
so
divert
itself
or
dissipate
and
prostitute
itself
it
seems
that
by
prostitution
i
mean
usefulness
there
have
been
red
rains
that
in
the
middle
ages
were
called
rains
of
blood
such
rains
terrified
many
persons
and
were
so
unsettling
to
large
populations
that
science
in
its
sociologic
relations
has
sought
by
eddy
method
to
remove
an
evil
that
rains
of
blood
do
not
exist
that
rains
so
called
are
only
of
water
colored
by
sand
from
the
sahara
desert
my
own
acceptance
is
that
such
assurances
whether
fictitious
or
not
whether
the
sahara
is
a
dazzling
white
desert
or
not
have
wrought
such
good
effects
in
a
sociologic
sense
even
though
prostitutional
in
the
positivist
sense
that
in
the
sociologic
sense
they
were
well
justified
but
that
we
gone
on
that
this
is
the
twentieth
century
that
most
of
us
have
grown
up
so
that
such
soporifics
of
the
past
are
no
longer
necessary
that
if
gushes
of
blood
should
fall
from
the
sky
upon
new
york
city
business
would
go
on
as
usual
we
began
with
rains
that
we
accepted
ourselves
were
most
likely
only
of
sand
in
my
own
still
immature
hereticalness
and
by
heresy
or
progress
i
mean
very
largely
a
return
though
with
many
modifications
to
the
superstitions
of
the
past
i
think
i
feel
considerable
aloofness
to
the
idea
of
rains
of
blood
just
at
present
it
is
my
conservative
or
timid
purpose
to
express
only
that
there
have
been
red
rains
that
very
strongly
suggest
blood
or
finely
divided
animal
matter
d√©bris
from
disasters

whatever
this

may
have
been

persistent

infinite

d√©bris

different

there
have
been

before

there
fell
at

holland
a
red
rain
as
to

two
chemists
of
bruges
concentrated
ounces
of
the
rain
to
ounces
no
precipitate
fell
but
the
color
was
so
marked
that
had
there
been
sand
it
would
have
been
deposited
if
the
substance
had
been
diluted
instead
of
concentrated
experiments
were
made
and
various
reagents
did
cast
precipitates
but
other
than
sand
the
chemists
concluded
that
the
contained
muriate
of
cobalt
which
is
not
very
enlightening

could
be
said

the

does

necessity
he
writes
i
am
by
no

satisfied
that
the

was
of

his
observations
are
that
drops
of
this

left
stains
such
as

water
could
not
leave
he
notes
that
when
the
water
evaporated
no

was

now

with

that
has
been
foreshadowed
which
will
recur
and
recur
and
recur
throughout
this

it
is
a
factor
that
makes
for
speculation
so
revolutionary
that
it
will
have
to
be
reinforced

times

book
of
quotation
from
a
letter
from
campini
to
matteucci
that
upon
at
about
in
the
northwestern
part
of
siena
a
reddish
rain
fell
copiously
for
two
hours
a
second
red
shower
fell
at
three
days
later
the
red
rain
fell
again
the
next
day
another
red
rain
fell
still
more
extraordinarily
each
fall
occurred
in
exactly
the
same
quarter
of
town
it
is
in
the
records
of
the
french
academy
that
upon
march
in
the
town
of
fell
a
reddish
substance
that
was
thick
viscous
and
putrid
journal
of
story
of
a
highly
unpleasant
substance
that
had
fallen
from
the
sky
in
wilson
county
tennessee
we
read
that
troost
visited
the
place
and
investigated
later
we
going
to
investigate
some
investigations
but
never
mind
that
now
troost
reported
that
the
substance
was
clear
blood
and
portions
of
flesh
scattered
upon
tobacco
fields
he
argued
that
a
whirlwind
might
have
taken
an
animal
up
from
one
place
mauled
it
around
and
have
precipitated
its
remains
somewhere
else
but
in
volume
page
of
the
there
is
an
apology
the
whole
matter
is
upon
newspaper
authority
said
to
have
been
a
hoax
by
negroes
who
had
pretended
to
have
seen
the
shower
for
the
sake
of
practicing
upon
the
credulity
of
their
masters
that
they
had
scattered
the
decaying
flesh
of
a
dead
hog
over
the
tobacco
fields
if
we
do
accept
this
datum
at
least
we
see
the
sociologically
necessary
determination
to
have
all
falls
accredited
to
earthly
origins
even
when
they
falls
that
do
fall
that
upon
the
of
august
something
had
fallen
from
the
sky
at
amherst
mass
it
had
been
examined
and
described
by
graves
formerly
lecturer
at
dartmouth
college
it
was
an
object
that
had
upon
it
a
nap
similar
to
that
of
milled
cloth
upon
removing
this
nap
a
pulpy
substance
was
found
it
had
an
offensive
odor
and
upon
exposure
to
the
air
turned
to
a
vivid
red
this
thing
was
said
to
have
fallen
with
a
brilliant
light
also
see
the
philosophical
in
the
de
arago
accepts
the
datum
and
gives
four
instances
of
similar
objects
or
substances
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
two
of
which
we
shall
have
with
our
data
of
gelatinous
or
viscous
matter
and
two
of
which
i
omit
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
dates
given
are
too
far
back
in
the
journal
of
is
professor
account
communicated
by
professor
dewey
that
upon
the
evening
of
august
a
light
was
seen
in
amherst
a
falling
object
sound
as
if
of
an
explosion
in
the
home
of
dewey
this
light
was
reflected
upon
a
wall
of
a
room
in
which
were
several
members
of
dewey
family
the
next
morning
in
dewey
front
yard
in
what
is
said
to
have
been
the
only
position
from
which
the
light
that
had
been
seen
in
the
room
the
night
before
could
have
been
reflected
was
found
a
substance
unlike
anything
before
observed
by
anyone
who
saw
it
it
was
a
object
about
inches
in
diameter
and
one
inch
thick
bright
and
having
upon
it
a
fine
nap
upon
removing
this
covering
a
pulpy
substance
of
the
consistency
of
was
found
of
an
offensive
suffocating
smell
a
few
minutes
of
exposure
to
the
air
changed
the
buff
color
to
a
livid
color
resembling
venous
blood
it
absorbed
moisture
quickly
from
the
air
and
liquefied
for
some
of
the
chemic
reactions

there
another
lost
of
a
datum
that
seems
to
me
to
belong
here
london
april
fall
of
fish
that
had
occurred
in
the
neighborhood
of
allahabad
india
it
is
said
that
the
fish
were
of
the
chalwa
species
about
a
span
in
length
and
a
seer
in
weight
you
know
they
were
dead
and
dry
or
they
had
been
such
a
long
time
out
of
water
that
we
ca
accept
that
they
had
been
scooped
out
of
a
pond
by
a
whirlwind
even
though
they
were
so
definitely
identified
as
of
a
known
local
species
or
they
were
not
fish
at
all
i
incline
myself
to
the
acceptance
that
they
were
not
fish
but
slender
objects
of
the
same
substance
as
that
which
fell
at
amherst
it
is
said
that
whatever
they
were
they
could
not
be
eaten
that
in
the
pan
they
turned
to
blood
for
details
of
this
story
see
the
of
the
asiatic
society
of
may
or
is
the
date
given
in
the
in
the
journal
of
occurs
the
inevitable
damnation
of
the
amherst
object
edward
hitchcock
went
to
live
in
amherst
he
says
that
years
later
another
object
like
the
one
said
to
have
fallen
in
had
been
found
at
nearly
the
same
place
hitchcock
was
invited
by
graves
to
examine
it
exactly
like
the
first
one
corresponded
in
size
and
color
and
consistency
the
chemic
reactions
were
the
same
hitchcock
recognized
it
in
a
moment
it
was
a
gelatinous
fungus
he
did
not
satisfy
himself
as
to
just
the
exact
species
it
belonged
to
but
he
predicted
that
similar
fungi
might
spring
up
within
hours
but
before
evening
two
others
sprang
up
or
we
arrived
at
one
of
the
oldest
of
the
conventions
or
nostoc
we
shall
have
many
data
of
gelatinous
substance
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
almost
always
the
exclusionists
argue
that
it
was
only
nostoc
an
alga
or
in
some
respects
a
fungous
growth
the
rival
convention
is
spawn
of
frogs
or
of
fishes
these
two
conventions
have
made
a
strong
combination
in
instances
where
testimony
was
not
convincing
that
gelatinous
matter
had
been
seen
to
fall
it
was
said
that
the
gelatinous
substance
was
nostoc
and
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
when
the
testimony
was
too
good
that
it
had
fallen
it
was
said
to
be
spawn
that
had
been
carried
from
one
place
to
another
in
a
whirlwind
now
i
ca
say
that
nostoc
is
always
greenish
any
more
than
i
can
say
that
blackbirds
are
always
black
having
seen
a
white
one
we
shall
quote
a
scientist
who
knew
of
nostoc
when
so
to
know
was
convenient
when
we
come
to
reported
falls
of
gelatinous
substances
like
it
to
be
noticed
how
often
they
are
described
as
whitish
or
grayish
in
looking
up
the
subject
myself
i
have
read
only
of
greenish
nostoc
said
to
be
greenish
in
webster
dictionary
said
to
be
in
the
new
international
encyclopedia
from
bright
green
to
green
greenish
and
it
would
seem
acceptable
that
if
many
reports
of
white
birds
should
occur
the
birds
are
not
blackbirds
even
though
there
have
been
white
blackbirds
or
that
if
often
reported
grayish
or
whitish
gelatinous
substance
is
not
nostoc
and
is
not
spawn
if
occurring
in
times
unseasonable
for
spawn
the
kentucky
phenomenon
so
it
was
called
in
its
day
and
now
we
have
an
occurrence
that
attracted
a
great
deal
of
attention
in
its
own
time
usually
these
things
of
the
accursed
have
been
hushed
up
or
disregarded
suppressed
like
the
seven
black
rains
of
slains
but
upon
march
something
occurred
in
bath
county
kentucky
that
brought
many
newspaper
correspondents
to
the
scene
the
substance
that
looked
like
beef
that
fell
from
the
sky
upon
march
at
olympian
springs
bath
county
kentucky
flakes
of
a
substance
that
looked
like
beef
fell
from
the
sky
from
a
clear
sky
we
like
to
emphasize
that
it
was
said
that
nothing
but
this
falling
substance
was
visible
in
the
sky
it
fell
in
flakes
of
various
sizes
some
two
inches
square
one
three
or
four
inches
square
the
is
interesting
later
we
shall
think
of
it
as
signifying
pressure
somewhere
it
was
a
thick
shower
on
the
ground
on
trees
on
fences
but
it
was
narrowly
localized
or
upon
a
strip
of
land
about
yards
long
and
about
yards
wide
for
the
first
account
see
the
and
the
york
march
then
the
exclusionists
something
that
looked
like
beef
one
flake
of
it
the
size
of
a
square
envelope
if
we
think
of
how
hard
the
exclusionists
have
fought
to
reject
the
coming
of
dust
from
this
earth
externality
we
can
sympathize
with
them
in
this
sensational
instance
perhaps
newspaper
correspondents
wrote
broadcast
and
witnesses
were
quoted
and
this
time
there
is
no
mention
of
a
hoax
and
except
by
one
scientist
there
is
no
denial
that
the
fall
did
take
place
it
seems
to
me
that
the
exclusionists
are
still
more
emphatically
conservators
it
is
not
so
much
that
they
are
inimical
to
all
data
of
externally
derived
substances
that
fall
upon
this
earth
as
that
they
are
inimical
to
all
data
discordant
with
a
system
that
does
not
include
such
phenomena
or
the
spirit
or
hope
or
ambition
of
the
cosmos
which
we
call
attempted
positivism
not
to
find
out
the
new
not
to
add
to
what
is
called
knowledge
but
to
systematize
american
that
the
substance
reported
from
kentucky
had
been
examined
by
leopold
brandeis
at
last
we
have
a
proper
explanation
of
this
much
talked
of
phenomenon
it
has
been
comparatively
easy
to
identify
the
substance
and
to
fix
its
status
the
kentucky
is
no
more
or
less
than
nostoc
or
that
it
had
not
fallen
that
it
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
and
had
swollen
in
rain
and
attracting
attention
by
greatly
increased
volume
had
been
supposed
by
unscientific
observers
to
have
fallen
in
rain
what
rain
i
do
know
also
it
is
spoken
of
as
dried
several
times
that
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
details
but
the
relief
of
outraged
propriety
expressed
in
the
is
amusing
to
some
of
us
who
i
fear
may
be
a
little
improper
at
times
very
spirit
of
the
salvation
army
when
some
scientist
comes
out
with
an
explanation
of
the
vermiform
appendix
or
the
os
coccygis
that
would
have
been
acceptable
to
moses
to
give
completeness
to
the
proper
explanation
it
is
said
that
brandeis
had
identified
the
substance
as
nostoc
lawrence
smith
of
kentucky
one
of
the
most
resolute
of
the
exclusionists
york
march
that
the
substance
had
been
examined
and
analyzed
by
smith
according
to
whom
it
gave
every
indication
of
being
the
dried
spawn
of
some
reptile
doubtless
of
the
frog
or
up
from
one
place
and
down
in
another
as
to
dried
that
may
refer
to
condition
when
smith
received
it
in
the
american
mead
edwards
president
of
the
newark
scientific
association
writes
that
when
he
saw
brandeis
communication
his
feeling
was
of
conviction
that
propriety
had
been
or
that
the
problem
had
been
solved
as
he
expresses
it
knowing
brandeis
well
he
had
called
upon
that
upholder
of
respectability
to
see
the
substance
that
had
been
identified
as
nostoc
but
he
had
also
called
upon
hamilton
who
had
a
specimen
and
hamilton
had
declared
it
to
be
edwards
writes
of
the
substance
that
had
so
completely
or
beautifully
if
beauty
is
completeness
been
identified
as
nostoc
it
turned
out
to
be
also
he
wrote
to
other
persons
who
had
specimens
and
identified
other
specimens
as
masses
of
cartilage
or
muscular
fibers
as
to
whence
it
came
i
have
no
theory
nevertheless
he
endorses
the
local
explanation
and
a
bizarre
thing
it
is
a
flock
of
gorged
buzzards
but
far
up
and
invisible
in
the
clear
sky
they
had
disgorged
fassig
lists
the
substance
in
his
bibliography
as
fish
spawn
mcatee
weather
may
lists
it
as
a
material
supposed
to
have
been
the
dried
spawn
either
of
fishes
or
of
some
batrachian
or
this
is
why
against
the
seemingly
insuperable
odds
against
all
things
new
there
can
be
what
is
called
progress
that
nothing
is
positive
in
the
aspects
of
homogeneity
and
unity
if
the
whole
world
should
seem
to
combine
against
you
it
is
only
unreal
combination
or
intermediateness
to
unity
and
disunity
every
resistance
is
itself
divided
into
parts
resisting
one
another
the
simplest
strategy
seems
to
be
never
bother
to
fight
a
thing
set
its
own
parts
fighting
one
another
we
are
merging
away
from
carnal
to
gelatinous
substance
and
here
there
is
an
abundance
of
instances
or
reports
of
instances
these
data
are
so
improper
they
obscene
to
the
science
of
today
but
we
shall
see
that
science
before
it
became
so
rigorous
was
not
so
prudish
chladni
was
not
and
greg
was
not
i
shall
have
to
accept
myself
that
gelatinous
substance
has
often
fallen
from
the
sky
or
that
far
up
or
far
away
the
whole
sky
is
gelatinous
that
meteors
tear
through
and
detach
fragments
that
fragments
are
brought
down
by
storms
that
the
twinkling
of
stars
is
penetration
of
light
through
something
that
quivers
i
think
myself
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
the
whole
sky
is
gelatinous
it
seems
more
acceptable
that
only
certain
areas
are
humboldt
says
that
all
our
data
in
this
respect
must
be
classed
amongst
the
mythical
fables
of
mythology
he
is
very
sure
but
just
a
little
redundant
we
shall
be
opposed
by
the
standard
resistances
there
in
the
first
place
up
from
one
place
in
a
whirlwind
and
down
in
another
we
shall
not
bother
to
be
very
convincing
one
way
or
another
because
of
the
of
the
datum
with
which
we
shall
end
up
it
will
mean
that
something
had
been
in
a
stationary
position
for
several
days
over
a
small
part
of
a
small
town
in
england
this
is
the
revolutionary
thing
that
we
have
alluded
to
before
whether
the
substance
were
nostoc
or
spawn
or
some
kind
of
a
larval
nexus
does
matter
so
much
if
it
stood
in
the
sky
for
several
days
we
rank
with
moses
as
a
chronicler
of
improprieties
or
was
that
story
or
datum
we
mean
told
by
moses
then
we
shall
have
so
many
records
of
gelatinous
substance
said
to
have
fallen
with
meteorites
that
between
the
two
phenomena
some
of
us
will
have
to
accept
connection
or
that
there
are
at
least
vast
gelatinous
areas
aloft
and
that
meteorites
tear
through
carrying
down
some
of
the
substance
that
in
vallot
member
of
the
french
academy
placed
before
the
academy
some
fragments
of
a
gelatinous
substance
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
and
asked
that
they
be
analyzed
there
is
no
further
allusion
to
this
subject
that
in
wilna
lithuania
april
in
a
rainstorm
fell
masses
of
a
substance
that
is
described
as
both
resinous
and
gelatinous
it
was
odorless
until
burned
then
it
spread
a
very
pronounced
sweetish
odor
it
is
described
as
like
gelatine
but
much
firmer
but
having
been
in
water
hours
it
swelled
out
and
looked
altogether
gelatinous
it
was
grayish
we
are
told
that
in
and
a
similar
substance
had
fallen
in
asia
minor
in
and
it
is
said
that
early
in
august
thousands
of
jellyfish
about
the
size
of
a
shilling
had
fallen
at
bath
england
i
think
it
is
not
acceptable
that
they
were
jellyfish
but
it
does
look
as
if
this
time
frog
spawn
did
fall
from
the
sky
and
may
have
been
translated
by
a
whirlwind
because
at
the
same
time
small
frogs
fell
at
wigan
england
that
june
at
eton
bucks
england
the
ground
was
found
covered
with
masses
of
jelly
the
size
of
peas
after
a
heavy
rainfall
we
are
not
told
of
nostoc
this
time
it
is
said
that
the
object
contained
numerous
eggs
of
some
species
of
chironomus
from
which
larvae
soon
emerged
i
incline
then
to
think
that
the
objects
that
fell
at
bath
were
neither
jellyfish
nor
masses
of
frog
spawn
but
something
of
a
larval
kind
this
is
what
had
occurred
at
bath
england
years
before
london
april
that
upon
the
of
april
a
storm
of
glutinous
drops
neither
jellyfish
nor
masses
of
frog
spawn
but
something
of
a
line
missing
here
in
original
text
ed
railroad
station
at
bath
many
soon
developed
into
a
chrysalis
about
an
inch
in
length
the
account
of
this
occurrence
in
the
is
more
like
the
of
minute
forms
said
to
have
been
infusoria
not
forms
about
an
inch
in
length
ent
soc
of
xxii
that
the
phenomenon
has
been
investigated
by
the
rev
jenyns
of
bath
his
description
is
of
minute
worms
in
filmy
envelopes
he
tries
to
account
for
their
segregation
the
mystery
of
it
is
what
could
have
brought
so
many
of
them
together
many
other
falls
we
shall
have
record
of
and
in
most
of
them
segregation
is
the
great
mystery
a
whirlwind
seems
anything
but
a
segregative
force
segregation
of
things
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
has
been
avoided
as
most
of
the
damned
jenyns
conceives
of
a
large
pool
in
which
were
many
of
these
spherical
masses
of
the
pool
drying
up
and
concentrating
all
in
a
small
area
of
a
whirlwind
then
scooping
all
up
together
but
several
days
later
more
of
these
objects
fell
in
the
same
place
that
such
marksmanship
is
not
attributable
to
whirlwinds
seems
to
me
to
be
what
we
think
we
mean
by
common
sense
it
may
not
look
like
common
sense
to
say
that
these
things
had
been
stationary
over
the
town
of
bath
several
days
the
seven
black
rains
of
slains
the
four
red
rains
of
siena
an
interesting
sidelight
on
the
mechanics
of
orthodoxy
is
that
jenyns
dutifully
records
the
second
fall
but
ignores
it
in
his
explanation
greg
one
of
the
most
notable
of
cataloguers
of
meteoritic
phenomena
records
falls
of
viscid
substance
in
the
years
he
gives
earlier
dates
but
i
practice
exclusions
myself
in
the
of
the
british
greg
records
a
meteor
that
seemed
to
pass
near
the
ground
between
barsdorf
and
freiburg
germany
the
next
day
a
mass
was
found
in
the
snow
unseasonableness
for
either
spawn
or
nostoc
greg
comment
in
this
instance
is
curious
if
true
but
he
records
without
modification
the
fall
of
a
meteorite
at
gotha
germany
leaving
a
mass
on
the
ground
we
are
told
that
this
substance
fell
only
three
feet
away
from
an
observer
in
the
of
the
british
according
to
a
letter
from
greg
to
at
night
near
coblenz
a
german
who
was
known
to
greg
and
another
person
saw
a
luminous
body
fall
close
to
them
they
returned
next
morning
and
found
a
gelatinous
mass
of
grayish
color
according
to
chladni
account
of
a
viscous
mass
fell
with
a
luminous
meteorite
between
siena
and
rome
may
viscous
matter
found
after
the
fall
of
a
fire
ball
in
lusatia
march
fall
of
a
gelatinous
substance
after
the
explosion
of
a
meteorite
near
heidelberg
july
in
the
philosophical
the
substance
that
fell
at
lusatia
is
said
to
have
been
of
the
color
and
odor
of
dried
brown
varnish
in
the
jour
it
is
said
that
gelatinous
matter
fell
with
a
globe
of
fire
upon
the
island
of
lethy
india
in
the
jour
in
many
observations
upon
the
meteors
of
november
are
reports
of
falls
of
gelatinous
substance
that
according
to
newspaper
reports
lumps
of
jelly
were
found
on
the
ground
at
rahway
the
substance
was
whitish
or
resembled
the
coagulated
white
of
an
egg
that
garland
of
nelson
county
virginia
had
found
a
substance
of
about
the
circumference
of
a
piece
that
according
to
a
communication
from
twining
to
olmstead
a
woman
at
west
point
had
seen
a
mass
the
size
of
a
teacup
it
looked
like
boiled
starch
that
according
to
a
newspaper
of
newark
a
mass
of
gelatinous
substance
like
soft
soap
had
been
found
it
possessed
little
elasticity
and
on
the
application
of
heat
it
evaporated
as
readily
as
water
it
seems
incredible
that
a
scientist
would
have
such
hardihood
or
infidelity
as
to
accept
that
these
things
had
fallen
from
the
sky
nevertheless
olmstead
who
collected
these
lost
souls
says
the
fact
that
the
supposed
deposits
were
so
uniformly
described
as
gelatinous
substance
forms
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
supposition
that
they
had
the
origin
ascribed
to
them
in
contemporaneous
scientific
publications
considerable
attention
was
given
to
olmstead
series
of
papers
upon
this
subject
of
the
november
meteors
you
will
not
find
one
mention
of
the
part
that
treats
of
gelatinous
matter
i
shall
attempt
not
much
of
correlation
of
dates
a
positivist
with
his
delusion
that
in
an
intermediate
state
twice
two
are
four
whereas
if
we
accept
continuity
we
can
not
accept
that
there
are
anywhere
two
things
to
start
with
would
search
our
data
for
periodicities
it
is
so
obvious
to
me
that
the
mathematic
or
the
regular
is
the
attribute
of
the
universal
that
i
have
not
much
inclination
to
look
for
it
in
the
local
still
in
this
solar
system
as
a
whole
there
is
considerable
approximation
to
regularity
or
the
mathematic
is
so
nearly
localized
that
eclipses
for
instance
can
with
rather
high
approximation
be
foretold
though
i
have
notes
that
would
deflate
a
little
the
astronomers
vainglory
in
this
respect
or
would
if
that
were
possible
an
astronomer
is
poorly
paid
uncheered
by
crowds
considerably
isolated
he
lives
upon
his
own
inflations
deflate
a
bear
and
it
could
hibernate
this
solar
system
is
like
every
other
phenomenon
that
can
be
regarded
as
a
whole
or
the
affairs
of
a
ward
are
interfered
with
by
the
affairs
of
the
city
of
which
it
is
a
part
city
by
county
county
by
state
state
by
nation
nation
by
other
nations
all
nations
by
climatic
conditions
climatic
conditions
by
solar
circumstances
sun
by
general
planetary
circumstances
solar
system
as
a
whole
by
other
solar
systems
so
the
hopelessness
of
finding
the
phenomena
of
entirety
in
the
ward
of
a
city
but
positivists
are
those
who
try
to
find
the
unrelated
in
the
ward
of
a
city
in
our
acceptance
this
is
the
spirit
of
cosmic
religion
objectively
the
state
is
not
realizable
in
the
ward
of
a
city
but
if
a
positivist
could
bring
himself
to
absolute
belief
that
he
had
found
it
that
would
be
a
subjective
realization
of
that
which
is
unrealizable
objectively
of
course
we
do
not
draw
a
positive
line
between
the
objective
and
the
subjective
or
that
all
phenomena
called
things
or
persons
are
subjective
within
one
nexus
and
that
thoughts
within
those
that
are
commonly
called
persons
are
it
is
rather
as
if
intermediateness
strove
for
regularity
in
this
solar
system
and
failed
then
generated
the
mentality
of
astronomers
and
in
that
secondary
expression
strove
for
conviction
that
failure
had
been
success
i
have
tabulated
all
the
data
of
this
book
and
a
great
deal
besides
card
system
and
several
proximities
thus
emphasized
have
been
revelations
to
me
nevertheless
it
is
only
the
method
of
theologians
and
scientists
worst
of
all
of
statisticians
for
instance
by
the
statistic
method
i
could
prove
that
a
black
rain
has
fallen
regularly
every
seven
months
somewhere
upon
this
earth
to
do
this
i
have
to
include
red
rains
and
yellow
rains
but
conventionally
i
pick
out
the
black
particles
in
red
substances
and
in
yellow
substances
and
disregard
the
rest
then
too
if
here
and
there
a
black
rain
should
be
a
week
early
or
a
month
late
that
would
be
acceleration
or
retardation
this
is
supposed
to
be
legitimate
in
working
out
the
periodicities
of
comets
if
black
rains
or
red
or
yellow
rains
with
black
particles
in
them
should
not
appear
at
all

dates
we

darwin
in
vain
the
records

they

for
them
we

periodicities
still
i
have
had
to
notice
the

for

i
shall
not
note
them
all
in
this

but
i
have
records
of
extraordinary
events
in
someone
should
write
a
book
upon
the
phenomena
of
this
one
year
that
is
if
books
should
be
written
is
notable
for
extraordinary
falls
so
far
apart
that
a
local
explanation
seems
inadequate
not
only
the
black
rain
of
ireland
may
but
a
red
rain
in
sicily
and
a
red
rain
in
wales
also
it
is
said
timb
that
upon
april
or
shepherds
near
mt
ararat
found
a
substance
that
was
not
indigenous
upon
areas
measuring
to
miles
in
circumference
presumably
it
had
fallen
there
we
have
already
gone
into
the
subject
of
science
and
its
attempted
positiveness
and
its
resistances
in
that
it
must
have
relations
of
service
it
is
very
easy
to
see
that
most
of
the
theoretic
science
of
the
century
was
only
a
relation
of
reaction
against
theologic
dogma
and
has
no
more
to
do
with
truth
than
has
a
wave
that
bounds
back
from
a
shore
or
if
a
shop
girl
or
you
or
i
should
pull
out
a
piece
of
chewing
gum
about
a
yard
long
that
would
be
quite
as
scientific
a
performance
as
was
the
stretching
of
this
earth
age
several
hundred
millions
of
years
all
things
are
not
things
but
only
relations
or
expressions
of
relations
but
all
relations
are
striving
to
be
the
unrelated
or
have
surrendered
to
and
subordinated
to
higher
attempts
so
there
is
a
positivist
aspect
to
this
reaction
that
is
itself
only
a
relation
and
that
is
the
attempt
to
assimilate
all
phenomena
under
the
materialist
explanation
or
to
formulate
a
final
system
upon
the
materialist
basis
if
this
attempt
could
be
realized
that
would
be
the
attaining
of
realness
but
this
attempt
can
be
made
only
by
disregarding
psychic
phenomena
for
instance
or
if
science
shall
eventually
give
in
to
the
psychic
it
would
be
no
more
legitimate
to
explain
the
immaterial
in
terms
of
the
material
than
to
explain
the
material
in
terms
of
the
immaterial
our
own
acceptance
is
that
material
and
immaterial
are
of
a
oneness
merging
for
instance
in
a
thought
that
is
continuous
with
a
physical
action
that
oneness
can
not
be
explained
because
the
process
of
explaining
is
the
interpreting
of
something
in
terms
of
something
else
all
explanation
is
assimilation
of
something
in
terms
of
something
else
that
has
been
taken
as
a
basis
but
in
continuity
there
is
nothing
that
is
any
more
basic
than
anything
else
unless
we
think
that
delusion
built
upon
delusion
is
less
real
than
its
in
timb
in
persia
fell
a
substance
that
the
people
said
they
had
never
seen
before
as
to
what
it
was
they
had
not
a
notion
but
they
saw
that
the
sheep
ate
it
they
ground
it
into
flour
and
made
bread
said
to
have
been
passable
enough
though
insipid
that
was
a
chance
that
science
did
not
neglect
manna
was
placed
upon
a
reasonable
basis
or
was
assimilated
and
reconciled
with
the
system
that
had
ousted
the
older
and
less
nearly
real
system
it
was
said
that
likely
enough
manna
had
fallen
in
ancient
times
because
it
was
still
falling
but
that
there
was
no
tutelary
influence
behind
it
that
it
was
a
lichen
from
the
steppes
of
asia
minor
from
one
place
in
a
whirlwind
and
down
in
another
place
in
the
it
is
said
that
this
substance
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
region
was
immediately
recognized
by
scientists
who
examined
it
and
that
the
chemical
analysis
also
identified
it
as
a
lichen
this
was
back
in
the
days
when
chemical
analysis
was
a
god
since
then
his
devotees
have
been
shocked
and
disillusioned
just
how
a
chemical
analysis
could
so
botanize
i
do
know
but
it
was
chemical
analysis
who
spoke
and
spoke
dogmatically
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ignorance
of
inhabitants
contrasting
with
the
local
knowledge
of
foreign
scientists
is
overdone
if
there
anything
good
to
eat
within
any
distance
conveniently
covered
by
a
whirlwind
inhabitants
know
it
i
have
data
of
other
falls
in
persia
and
asiatic
turkey
of
edible
substances
they
are
all
dogmatically
said
to
be
manna
and
manna
is
dogmatically
said
to
be
a
species
of
lichens
from
the
steppes
of
asia
minor
the
position
that
i
take
is
that
this
explanation
was
evolved
in
ignorance
of
the
fall
of
vegetable
substances
or
edible
substances
in
other
parts
of
the
world
that
it
is
the
familiar
attempt
to
explain
the
general
in
terms
of
the
local
that
if
we
shall
have
data
of
falls
of
vegetable
substance
in
say
canada
or
india
they
were
not
of
lichens
from
the
steppes
of
asia
minor
that
though
all
falls
in
asiatic
turkey
and
persia
are
sweepingly
and
conveniently
called
showers
of
manna
they
have
not
been
even
all
of
the
same
substance
in
one
instance
the
particles
are
said
to
have
been
seeds
though
in
the
substance
that
fell
in
and
is
said
to
have
been
gelatinous
in
the
sci
nat
de
it
is
said
to
have
been
of
something
in
lumps
the
size
of
a
filbert
that
had
been
ground
into
flour
that
of
this
flour
had
been
made
bread
very
but
flavorless
the
great
difficulty
is
to
explain
segregation
in
these
showers
but
fishes
and
occasional
falls
down
to
them
of
edible
substances
bags
of
grain
barrels
of
sugar
things
that
had
not
been
whirled
up
from
one
part
of
the
in
storms
or
submarine
disturbances
and
dropped
somewhere
else
i
suppose
one
thinks
but
grain
in
bags
never
has
fallen
object
of
amherst
its
covering
like
milled
cloth
or
barrels
of
corn
lost
from
a
vessel
would
not
sink
but
a
host
of
them
clashing
together
after
a
wreck
they
burst
open
the
corn
sinks
or
does
when
saturated
the
barrel
staves
float
longer
if
there
be
not
an
overhead
traffic
in
commodities
similar
to
our
own
commodities
carried
over
this
earth
oceans
i
not
the
fish
i
think
i
am
i
have
no
data
other
than
the
mere
suggestion
of
the
amherst
object
of
bags
or
barrels
but
my
notion
is
that
bags
and
barrels
from
a
wreck
on
one
of
this
earth
oceans
would
by
the
time
they
reached
the
bottom
no
longer
be
recognizable
as
bags
or
barrels
that
if
we
can
have
data
of
the
fall
of
fibrous
material
that
may
have
been
cloth
or
paper
or
wood
we
shall
be
satisfactory
and
grotesque
enough
roy
irish
in
the
year
some
workmen
who
had
been
fetching
water
from
a
pond
seven
german
miles
from
memel
on
returning
to
their
work
after
dinner
during
which
there
had
been
a
snowstorm
found
the
flat
ground
around
the
pond
covered
with
a
leafy
mass
and
a
person
who
lived
near
said
he
had
seen
it
fall
like
flakes
with
the
snow
some
of
these
formations
were
as
large
as
a
the
mass
was
damp
and
smelt
disagreeably
like
rotten
seaweed
but
when
dried
the
smell
went
off
it
tore
fibrously
like
paper
classic
explanation
up
from
one
place
and
down
in
another
but
what
went
up
from
one
place
in
a
whirlwind
of
course
our
intermediatist
acceptance
is
that
had
this
been
the
strangest
substance
conceivable
from
the
strangest
other
world
that
could
be
thought
of
somewhere
upon
this
earth
there
must
be
a
substance
similar
to
it
or
from
which
it
would
at
least
subjectively
or
according
to
description
not
be
easily
distinguishable
or
that
everything
in

city
is
only
another
degree
or
aspect
of
something
or
combination

in
a
village
of

the

is
a
challenge
to
vulgarization
write
something
that
looks
new
to
you
someone
will
point
out
that
the
greeks
said
it
long
ago
existence
is
appetite
the
gnaw
of
being
the
one
attempt
of
all
things
to
assimilate
all
other
things
if
they
have
not
surrendered
and
submitted
to
some
higher
attempt
it
was
cosmic
that
these
scientists
who
had
surrendered
to
and
submitted
to
the
scientific
system
should
consistently
with
the
principles
of
that
system
attempt
to
assimilate
the
substance
that
fell
at
memel
with
some
known
terrestrial
product
at
the
meeting
of
the
royal
irish
academy
it
was
brought
out
that
there
is
a
substance
of
rather
rare
occurrence
that
has
been
known
to
form
in
thin
sheets
upon
marsh

it

the

if
broken
up
the

it

an

can
be
identified
as
a
sunflower
both
have
long
stems
a
camel
is
indistinguishable
from
a
peanut
if
only
their
humps
be
considered
trouble
with
this
book
is
that
we
end
up
a
lot
of
intellectual
rou√©s
we
be
incapable
of
being
astonished
with
anything
we
knew
to
start
with
that
science
and
imbecility
are
continuous
nevertheless
so
many
expressions
of
the
are
at
first
startling
we
did
think
that
hitchcock
performance
in
identifying
the
amherst
phenomenon
as
a
fungus
was
rather
notable
as
scientific
vaudeville
if
we
acquit
him
of
the
charge
of
seriousness
or
that
in
a
place
where
fungi
were
so
common
that
before
a
given
evening
two
of
them
sprang
up
only
he
a
stranger
in
this
very
fungiferous
place
knew
a
fungus
when
he
saw
something
like
a
fungus
if
we
disregard
its
quick
liquefaction
for
instance
it
was
only
a
monologue
however
now
we
have
an
cast
and
they
not
only
irish
they
royal
irish
the
royal
irishmen
excluded
and
included
fibrousness
so
then
that
this
substance
was
marsh
paper
which
had
been
raised
into
the
air
by
storms
of
wind
and
had
again
fallen
second
act
it
was
said
that
according
to
ehrenberg
the
was
found
to
consist
partly
of
vegetable
matter

of

of
the
royal
irishmen
chairs
tables
irishmen
some
flakes
of

exhibited
their
composition
was
chiefly
of
coniferv√¶
this
was
a
double
inclusion
or
it
the
method
of
agreement
that
logicians
make
so
much
of
so
no
logician
would
be
satisfied
with
identifying
a
peanut
as
a
camel
because
both
have
humps
he
demands
accessory
agreement
that
both
can
live
a
long
time
without
water
for
instance
now
it
not
so
very
unreasonable
at
least
to
the
free
and
easy
vaudeville
standards
that
throughout
this
book
we
are
considering
to
think
that
a
green
substance
could
be
snatched
up
from
one
place
in
a
whirlwind
and
fall
as
a
black
substance
somewhere
else
but
the
royal
irishmen
excluded
something
else
and
it
is
a
datum
that
was
as
accessible
to
them
as
it
is
to
me
that
according
to
chladni
this
was
no
little
local
deposition
that
was
seen
to
occur
by
some
indefinite
person
living
near
a
pond
somewhere
it
was
a
tremendous
fall
from
a
vast
likely
enough
all
the
marsh
paper
in
the
world
could
not
have
supplied
it
at
the
same
time
this
substance
was
falling
in
great
quantities
in
norway
and
pomerania
or
see
kirkwood
substance
like
charred
paper
fell
in
norway
and
other
parts
of
northern
europe
or
a
whirlwind
with
a
distribution
as
wide
as
that
would
not
acceptably
i
should
say
have
so
specialized
in
the
rare
substance
called
marsh
paper
there
have
been
falls
of
fence
rails
roofs
of
houses
parts
of
trees
nothing
is
said
of
the
occurrence
of
a
tornado
in
northern
europe
in
january
there
is
record
only
of
this
one
substance
having
fallen
in
various
places
time
went
on
but
the
conventional
determination
to
exclude
data
of
all
falls
to
this
earth
except
of
substances
of
this
earth
and
of
ordinary
meteoric
matter
strengthened
of
the
substance
that
fell
in
january
is
described
as
a
mass
of
black
leaves
having
the
appearance
of
burnt
paper
but
harder
and
cohering
and
brittle
marsh
paper
is
not
mentioned
and
there
is
nothing
said
of
the
coniferv√¶
which
seemed
so
convincing
to
the
royal
irishmen
vegetable
composition
is
disregarded
quite
as
it
might
be
by
someone
who
might
find
it
convenient
to
identify
a
squash
as
a
big
fishhook
meteorites
are
usually
covered
with
a
black
crust
more
or
less
the
substance
of
is
black
and
if
so
be
convenience
is
in
this
attempt
to
assimilate
with
the
conventional
we
are
told
that
the
substance
is
a
mineral
mass
that
it
is
like
the
black
scales
that
cover
meteorites
the
scientist
who
made
this
identification
was
von
grotthus
he
had
appealed
to
the
god
chemical
analysis
or
the
power
and
glory
of
mankind
with
which
we
not
always
so
impressed
but
the
gods
must
tell
us
what
we
want
them
to
tell
us
we
see
again
that
though
nothing
has
identity
of
its
own
anything
can
be
identified
as
anything
or
there
nothing
that
not
reasonable
if
one
snoopeth
not
into
its
exclusions
but
here
the
conflict
did
not
end
berzelius
examined
the
substance
he
could
not
find
nickel
in
it
at
that
time
the
presence
of
nickel
was
the
positive
test
of
meteoritic
matter
whereupon
with
a
supposititious
positive
standard
of
judgment
against
him
von
grotthus
revoked
his
identification
and
mag
of
nat
this
equalization
of
eminences
permits
us
to
project
with
our
own
expression
which
otherwise
would
be
subdued
into
invisibility
that
it
too
bad
that
no
one
ever
looked
to
see
hieroglyphics
something
written
upon
these
sheets
of
paper
if
we
have
no
very
great
variety
of
substances
that
have
fallen
to
this
earth
if
upon
this
earth
surface
there
is
infinite
variety
of
substances
detachable
by
whirlwinds
two
falls
of
such
a
rare
substance
as
marsh
paper
would
be
remarkable
a
writer
in
the
says
that
at
the
time
of
writing
he
had
before
him
a
portion
of
a
sheet
of
square
feet
of
a
substance
that
had
fallen
at
carolath
silesia
in
exactly
similar
to
of
which
clothing
might
have
been
made
the
god
microscopic
examination
had
spoken
the
substance
consisted
chiefly
of
coniferv√¶
asiatic
soc
of
that
march
about
the
time
of
a
fall
of
edible
substance
in
asia
minor
an
powder
fell
at
shanghai
under
the
microscope
it
was
seen
to
be
an
aggregation
of
hairs
of
two
kinds
black
ones
and
rather
thick
white
ones
they
were
supposed
to
be
mineral
fibers
but
when
burned
they
gave
out
the
common
ammoniacal
smell
and
smoke
of
burnt
hair
or
feathers
the
writer
described
the
phenomenon
as
a
cloud
of
square
miles
of
fibers
alkali
and
sand
in
a
postscript
he
says
that
other
investigators
with
more
powerful
microscopes
gave
opinion
that
the
fibers
were
not
hairs
that
the
substance
consisted
chiefly
of
coniferv√¶
or
the
pathos
of
it
perhaps
or
the
dull
and
uninspired
but
courageous
persistence
of
the
scientific
everything
seemingly
found
out
is
doomed
to
be
subverted
by
more
powerful
microscopes
and
telescopes
by
more
refined
precise
searching
means
and
methods
the
new
pronouncements
irrepressibly
bobbing
up
their
reception
always
as
truth
at
last
always
the
illusion
of
the
final
very
little
of
the
intermediatist
spirit
that
the
new
that
has
displaced
the
old
will
itself
some
day
be
displaced
that
it
too
will
be
recognized
as
but
that
if
phantoms
climb
spooks
of
ladders
are
good
enough
for
them
that
according
to
a
report
by
lain√©
french
consul
at
pernambuco
early
in
october
there
was
a
shower
of
a
substance
resembling
silk
the
quantity
was
as
tremendous
as
might
be
a
whole
cargo
lost
somewhere
between
jupiter
and
mars
having
drifted
around
perhaps
for
centuries
the
original
fabrics
slowly
disintegrating
in
de
it
is
said
that
samples
of
this
substance
were
sent
to
france
by
lain√©
and
that
they
proved
to
have
some
resemblances
to
silky
filaments
which
at
certain
times
of
the
year
are
carried
by
the
wind
near
paris
in
the
of
there
is
mention
of
a
fibrous
substance
like
blue
silk
that
fell
near
naumberg
march
according
to
chladni
de
the
quantity
was
great
he
places
a
question
mark
before
the
date
one
of
the
advantages
of
intermediatism
is
that
in
the
oneness
of
quasiness
there
can
be
no
mixed
metaphors
whatever
is
acceptable
of
anything
is
in
some
degree
or
aspect
acceptable
of
everything
so
it
is
quite
proper
to
speak
for
instance
of
something
that
is
as
firm
as
a
rock
and
that
sails
in
a
majestic
march
the
irish
are
good
monists
they
have
of
course
been
laughed
at
for
their
keener
perceptions
so
it
a
book
we
writing
or
it
a
procession
or
it
a
museum
with
the
chamber
of
horrors
rather
a
rather
horrible
correlation
occurs
in
the
what
interests
us
is
that
a
correspondent
saw
a
silky
substance
fall
from
the
sky
there
was
an
aurora
borealis
at
the
time
he
attributes
the
substance
to
the
aurora
since
the
time
of
darwin
the
classic
explanation
has
been
that
all
silky
substances
that
fall
from
the
sky
are
spider
webs
in
aboard
the
at
the
mouth
of
la
plata
river
miles
from
land
darwin
saw
an
enormous
number
of
spiders
of
the
kind
usually
known
as
gossamer
spiders
little
aeronauts
that
cast
out
filaments
by
which
the
wind
carries
them
it
difficult
to
express
that
silky
substances
that
have
fallen
to
this
earth
were
not
spider
webs
my
own
acceptance
is
that
spider
webs
are
the
merger
that
there
have
been
falls
of
an
externally
derived
silky
substance
and
also
of
the
webs
or
strands
rather
of
aeronautic
spiders
indigenous
to
this
earth
that
in
some
instances
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
of
course
our
expression
upon
silky
substances
will
merge
away
into
expressions
upon
other
seeming
textile
substances
and
i
do
know
how
much
better
off
be
except
that
if
fabricable
materials
have
fallen
from
the
sky
simply
to
establish
acceptance
of
that
may
be
doing
well
enough
in
this
book
of
first
and
tentative
explorations
in
the
year
is
described
a
fall
that
took
place
in
england
in
the
towns
of
bradly
selborne
and
alresford
and
in
a
triangular
space
included
by
these
three
towns
the
substance
is
described
as
cobwebs
but
it
fell
in
or
in
flakes
or
rags
about
one
inch
broad
and
five
or
six
inches
long
also
these
flakes
were
of
a
relatively
heavy
substance
they
fell
with
some
velocity
the
quantity
was
great
the
shortest
side
of
the
triangular
space
is
eight
miles
long
in
the
nat
hist
soc
it
is
said
that
there
were
two
falls
that
they
were
some
hours
apart
a
datum
that
is
becoming
familiar
to
us
a
datum
that
can
not
be
taken
into
the
fold
unless
we
find
it
repeated
over
and
over
and
over
again
it
is
said
that
the
second
fall
lasted
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
night
now
the
hypnosis
of
the
classic
that
what
we
call
intelligence
is
only
an
expression
of
inequilibrium
that
when
mental
adjustments
are
made
intelligence
ceases
or
of
course
that
intelligence
is
the
confession
of
ignorance
if
you
have
intelligence
upon
any
subject
that
is
something
you
still
learning
if
we
agree
that
that
which
is
learned
is
always
mechanically
done
in
of
course
because
nothing
is
ever
finally
learned
it
was
decided
that
this
substance
was
spiders
web
that
was
adjustment
but
it
not
adjustment
to
me
so
i
afraid
i
shall
have
some
intelligence
in
this
matter
if
i
ever
arrive
at
adjustment
upon
this
subject
then
upon
this
subject
i
shall
be
able
to
have
no
thoughts
except
i
have
yet
quite
decided
absolutely
everything
so
i
am
able
to
point
out
that
this
substance
was
of
quantity
so
enormous
that
it
attracted
wide
attention
when
it
came
down
that
it
would
have
been
equally
noteworthy
when
it
went
up
that
there
is
no
record
of
anyone
in
england
or
elsewhere
having
seen
tons
of
spider
webs
going
up
september
further
confession
of
intelligence
upon
my
part
that
if
it
be
contested
then
that
the
place
of
origin
may
have
been
far
away
but
still
terrestrial
then
it
that
other
familiar
matter
of
incredible
marksmanship
again
hitting
a
small
triangular
space
for
hours
interval
of
hours
then
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
night
same
small
triangular
space
these
are
the
disregards
of
the
classic
explanation
there
is
no
mention
of
spiders
having
been
seen
to
fall
but
a
good
inclusion
is
that
though
this
substance
fell
in
flakes
of
considerable
weight
it
was
viscous
in
this
respect
it
was
like
cobwebs
dogs
nosing
it
on
grass
were
blindfolded
with
it
this
circumstance
does
strongly
suggest
cobwebs
unless
we
can
accept
that
in
regions
aloft
there
are
vast
viscous
or
gelatinous
areas
and
that
things
passing
through
become
daubed
or
perhaps
we
clear
up
the
confusion
in
the
descriptions
of
the
substance
that
fell
in
and
in
asia
minor
described
in
one
publication
as
gelatinous
and
in
another
as
a
cereal
that
it
was
a
cereal
that
had
passed
through
a
gelatinous
region
that
the
substance
of
memel
may
have
had
such
an
experience
may
be
indicated
in
that
ehrenberg
found
in
it
gelatinous
matter
which
he
called
nostoc
and
mag
of
nat
fall
of
a
substance
described
as
cobwebs
latter
part
of
october
in
milwaukee
and
other
towns
other
towns
mentioned
are
green
bay
vesburge
fort
howard
sheboygan
and
ozaukee
the
aeronautic
spiders
are
known
as
gossamer
spiders
because
of
the
extreme
lightness
of
the
filaments
that
they
cast
out
to
the
wind
of
the
substance
that
fell
in
wisconsin
it
is
said
in
all
instances
the
webs
were
strong
in
texture
and
very
white
the
editor
says
curiously
enough
there
is
no
mention
in
any
of
the
reports
that
we
have
seen
of
the
presence
of
spiders
so
our
attempt
to
divorce
a
possible
external
product
from
its
terrestrial
merger
then
our
joy
of
the
prospector
who
thinks
he
found
something
the
weather
quotes
the
that
upon
numerous
batches
of
substance
fell
in
montgomery
in
strands
and
in
occasional
masses
several
inches
long
and
several
inches
broad
according
to
the
writer
it
was
not
spiders
web
but
something
like
asbestos
also
that
it
was
phosphorescent
the
editor
of
the
says
that
he
sees
no
reason
for
doubting
that
these
masses
were
cobwebs
a
correspondent
writes
that
he
sends
a
sample
of
a
substance
said
to
have
fallen
at
montussan
gironde
according
to
a
witness
quoted
by
the
correspondent
a
thick
cloud
accompanied
by
rain
and
a
violent
wind
had
appeared
this
cloud
was
composed
of
a
woolly
substance
in
lumps
the
size
of
a
fist
which
fell
to
the
ground
the
editor
tissandier
says
of
this
substance
that
it
was
white
but
was
something
that
had
been
burned
it
was
fibrous
tissandier
astonishes
us
by
saying
that
he
can
not
identify
this
substance
we
thought
that
anything
could
be
identified
as
anything
he
can
say
only
that
the
cloud
in
question
must
have
been
an
extraordinary
conglomeration
register
that
march
there
fell
in
the
fields
of
kourianof
russia
a
combustible
yellowish
substance
covering
at
least
two
inches
thick
an
area
of
or
square
feet
it
was
resinous
and
yellowish
so
one
inclines
to
the
conventional
explanation
that
it
was
pollen
from
pine
trees
but
when
torn
it
had
the
tenacity
of
cotton
when
placed
in
water
it
had
the
consistency
of
resin
this
resin
had
the
color
of
amber
was
elastic
like
india
rubber
and
smelled
like
prepared
oil
mixed
with
wax
so
in
general
our
notion
of
cargoes
and
our
notion
of
cargoes
of
food
supplies
in
is
an
extract
from
a
letter
by
robert
vans
of
kilkenny
ireland
dated
that
there
had
been
of
late
in
the
counties
of
limerick
and
tipperary
showers
of
a
sort
of
matter
like
butter
or
grease
having
a
very
stinking
smell
there
follows
an
extract
from
a
letter
by
the
bishop
of
cloyne
upon
a
very
odd
phenomenon
which
was
observed
in
munster
and
leinster
that
for
a
good
part
of
the
spring
of
there
fell
a
substance
which
the
country
people
called
butter
soft
clammy
and
of
a
dark
yellow
that
cattle
fed
indifferently
in
fields
where
this
substance
lay
it
fell
in
lumps
as
big
as
the
end
of
one
finger
it
had
a
strong
ill
scent
his
grace
calls
it
a
stinking
dew
in
vans
letter
it
is
said
that
the
butter
was
supposed
to
have
medicinal
properties
and
was
gathered
in
pots
and
other
vessels
by
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
place
and
in
all
the
following
volumes
of
there
is
no
speculation
upon
this
extraordinary
subject
ostracism
the
fate
of
this
datum
is
a
good
instance
of
damnation
not
by
denial
and
not
by
explaining
away
but
by
simple
disregard
the
fall
is
listed
by
chladni
and
is
mentioned
in
other
catalogues
but
from
the
absence
of
all
inquiry
and
of
all
but
formal
mention
we
see
that
it
has
been
under
excommunication
as
much
as
was
ever
anything
by
the
preceding
system
the
datum
has
been
buried
alive
it
is
as
irreconcilable
with
the
modern
system
of
dogmas
as
ever
were
geologic
strata
and
vermiform
appendix
with
the
preceding
system
if
intermittently
or
for
a
good
part
of
the
spring
this
substance
fell
in
two
irish
provinces
and
nowhere
else
we
have
stronger
than
before
a
sense
of
a
stationary
region
overhead
or
a
region
that
receives
products
like
this
earth
products
but
from
external
sources
a
region
in
which
this
earth
gravitational
and
meteorological
forces
are
relatively
inert
if
for
many
weeks
a
good
part
of
this
substance
did
hover
before
finally
falling
we
suppose
that
in
vans
and
the
bishop
of
cloyne
could
describe
what
they
saw
as
well
as
could
witnesses
in
nevertheless
it
is
going
far
back
we
shall
have
to
have
many
modern
instances
before
we
can
accept
as
to
other
falls
or
another
fall
it
is
said
in
the
jour
that
april
about
a
month
after
the
fall
of
the
substance
of
kourianof
fell
a
substance
that
was
transparent
soft
and
smelling
like
rancid
oil
herman
a
chemist
who
examined
it
named
it
sky
oil
for
analysis
and
chemic
reactions
see
the
the
new
philosophical
mentions
an
unctuous
substance
that
fell
near
rotterdam
in
in
there
is
an
account
of
an
oily
reddish
matter
that
fell
at
genoa
february
whatever
it
may
have
been
altogether
most
of
our
difficulties
are
problems
that
we
should
leave
to
later
developers
of
i
think
a
discoverer
of
america
should
leave
long
island
to
someone
else
if
there
be
plying
back
and
forth
from
jupiter
and
mars
and
venus
that
are
sometimes
wrecked
we
think
of
fuel
as
well
as
cargoes
of
course
the
most
convincing
data
would
be
of
coal
falling
from
the
sky
nevertheless
one
does
suspect
that
engines
were
discovered
ages
ago
in
more
advanced
worlds
but
as
i
say
we
should
leave
something
to
our
disciples
so
we
not
especially
wonder
whether
these
or
oily
substances
were
food
or
fuel
so
we
merely
note
that
in
the
is
an
account
of
hail
that
fell
in
the
middle
of
april
in
mississippi
in
which
was
a
substance
described
as
turpentine
something
that
tasted
like
orange
water
in
hailstones
about
the
first
of
june
near
n√Æmes
france
identified
as
nitric
acid
de
hail
and
ashes
in
ireland
that
at
elizabeth
june
fell
hail
in
which
was
a
substance
said
by
leeds
of
stevens
institute
to
be
carbonate
of
soda
we
are
getting
a
little
away
from
the
lines
of
our
composition
but
it
will
be
an
important
point
later
that
so
many
extraordinary
falls
have
occurred
with
hail
or
if
they
were
of
substances
that
had
had
origin
upon
some
other
part
of
this
earth
surface
had
the
hail
too
that
origin
our
acceptance
here
will
depend
upon
the
number
of
instances
reasonably
enough
some
of
the
things
that
fall
to
this
earth
should
coincide
with
falls
of
hail
as
to
vegetable
substances
in
quantities
so
great
as
to
suggest
lost
cargoes
we
have
a
note
in
the
that
upon
the
first
of
may
a
rain
fell
at
perpignan
bringing
down
with
it
a
red
substance
which
proved
on
examination
to
be
a
red
meal
mixed
with
fine
sand
at
various
points
along
the
mediterranean
this
substance
fell
there
is
in
an
account
of
a
seeming
cereal
said
to
have
fallen
in
wiltshire
in
said
that
some
of
the
wheat
fell
enclosed
in
hailstones
but
the
writer
in
says
that
he
had
examined
the
grains
and
that
they
were
nothing
but
seeds
of
ivy
berries
dislodged
from
holes
and
chinks
where
birds
had
hidden
them
if
birds
still
hide
ivy
seeds
and
if
winds
still
blow
i
do
see
why
the
phenomenon
has
not
repeated
in
more
than
two
hundred
years
since
or
the
red
matter
in
rain
at
siena
italy
may
said
by
arago
to
have
been
vegetable
matter
arago
somebody
should
collect
data
of
falls
at
siena
alone
in
the
weather
a
correspondent
writes
that
upon
at
pawpaw
michigan
upon
a
day
that
was
so
calm
that
his
windmill
did
not
run
fell
a
brown
dust
that
looked
like
vegetable
matter
the
editor
of
the
concludes
that
this
was
no
widespread
fall
from
a
tornado
because
it
had
been
reported
from
nowhere
else
rancidness
putridity
decomposition
a
note
that
has
been
struck
many
times
in
a
positive
sense
of
course
nothing
means
anything
or
every
meaning
is
continuous
with
all
other
meanings
or
that
all
evidences
of
guilt
for
instance
are
just
as
good
evidences
of
innocence
but
this
condition
seems
to
mean
things
lying
around
among
the
stars
a
long
time
horrible
disaster
in
the
time
of
julius
caesar
remains
from
it
not
reaching
this
earth
till
the
time
of
the
bishop
of
cloyne
we
leave
to
later
research
the
discussion
of
bacterial
action
and
decomposition
and
whether
bacteria
could
survive
in
what
we
call
space
of
which
we
know
nothing
machattie
writes
that
at
london
ontario
in
a
violent
storm
fell
with
snow
a
substance
estimated
at
tons
over
a
belt
miles
by
miles
it
was
examined
under
a
microscope
by
machattie
who
found
it
to
consist
mainly
of
vegetable
matter
far
advanced
in
decomposition
the
substance
was
examined
by
james
adams
of
glasgow
who
gave
his
opinion
that
it
was
the
remains
of
cereals
machattie
points
out
that
for
months
before
this
fall
the
ground
of
canada
had
been
frozen
so
that
in
this
case
a
more
than
ordinarily
remote
origin
has
to
be
thought
of
machattie
thinks
of
origin
to
the
south
however
he
says
this
is
mere
conjecture
jour
that
march
during
a
thunderstorm
at
rajkit
india
occurred
a
fall
of
grain
it
was
reported
by
sykes
of
the
british
association
the
natives
were
greatly
excited
because
it
was
grain
of
a
kind
unknown
to
them
usually
comes
forward
a
scientist
who
knows
more
of
the
things
that
natives
know
best
than
the
natives
know
but
it
so
happens
that
the
usual
thing
was
not
done
definitely
in
this
instance
the
grain
was
shown
to
some
botanists
who
did
not
immediately
recognize
it
but
thought
it
to
be
either
a
spartium
or
a
vicia
lead
silver
diamonds
glass
they
sound
like
the
accursed
but
they
not
they
now
of
the
chosen
that
is
when
they
occur
in
metallic
or
stony
masses
that
science
has
recognized
as
meteorites
we
find
that
resistance
is
to
substances
not
so
mixed
in
or
incorporated
of
accursed
data
it
seems
to
me
that
punk
is
pretty
damnable
in
the
of
the
british
there
is
mention
of
a
light
substance
that
has
fallen
with
meteorites
no
particulars
given
not
another
mention
anywhere
else
that
i
can
find
in
this
english
publication
the
word
punk
is
not
used
the

the
fall
of
sulphur
from
the
sky
has
been
especially
repulsive
to
the
modern
orthodoxy
largely
because
of
its
associations
with
the
superstitions
or
principles
of
the
preceding
orthodoxy
stories
of
devils
sulphurous
exhalations
several
writers
have
said
that
they
have
had
this
feeling
so
the
scientific
reactionists
who
have
rabidly
fought
the
preceding
because
it
was
the
preceding
and
the
scientific
prudes
who
in
sheer
exclusionism
have
held
lean
hands
over
pale
eyes
denying
falls
of
sulphur
i
have
many
notes
upon
the
sulphurous
odor
of
meteorites
and
many
notes
upon
phosphorescence
of
things
that
come
from
externality
some
day
i
shall
look
over
old
stories
of
demons
that
have
appeared
sulphurously
upon
this
earth
with
the
idea
of
expressing
that
we
have
often
had
undesirable
visitors
from
other
worlds
or
that
an
indication
of
external
derivation
is
sulphurousness
i
expect
some
day
to
rationalize
demonology
but
just
at
present
we
are
scarcely
far
enough
advanced
to
go
so
far
back
for
a
circumstantial
account
of
a
mass
of
burning
sulphur
about
the
size
of
a
man

that
fell
at
pultusk

road
where
it
was

the
power
of
the
exclusionists
lies
in
that
in
their
stand
are
combined
both
modern
and
archaic
systematists
falls
of
sandstone
and
limestone
are
repulsive
to
both
theologians
and
scientists
sandstone
and
limestone
suggest
other
worlds
upon
which
occur
processes
like
geological
processes
but
limestone
as
a
fossiliferous
substance
is
of
course
especially
of
the
unchosen
in
march
we
read
of
a
block
of
limestone
said
to
have
fallen
near
middleburg
florida
it
was
exhibited
at
the
exposition
at
jacksonville
the
writer
in
denies
that
it
fell
from
the
sky
his
reasoning
is
there
is
no
limestone
in
the
sky
therefore
this
limestone
did
not
fall
from
the
sky
better
reasoning
i
can
not
conceive
of
because
we
see
that
a
final
major
premise
universal
true
would
include
all
things
that
then
would
leave
nothing
to
reason
about
so
then
that
all
reasoning
must
be
based
upon
something
not
universal
or
only
a
phantom
intermediate
to
the
two
finalities
of
nothingness
and
allness
or
negativeness
and
positiveness

up

but
they
fell
with
hail
which
in
june
could
not
very
well
be
identified
with
ice
from
coincidence
perhaps
upon
page
the
editor
says
of
a
stone
that
was
reported
to
have
fallen
at
little
lever
england
that
a
sample
had
been
sent
to
him
it
was
sandstone
therefore
it
had
not
fallen
but
had
been
on
the
ground
in
the
first
place
but
upon
page
is
an
account
of
a
large
smooth
gritty
sandstone
pebble
that
had
been
found
in
the
wood
of
a
beech
tree
looks
to
me
as
if
it
had
fallen
and
had
penetrated
the
tree
with
high
velocity
but
i
have
never
heard
of
anything
falling
from
a
whirlwind
the
wood
around
this
sandstone
pebble
was
black
as
if
charred
farrington

instance

even
mention

the

falls
of
salt
have
occurred
often
they
have
been
avoided
by
scientific
writers
because
of
the
dictum
that
only
water
and
not
substances
held
in
solution
can
be
raised
by
evaporation
however
falls
of
salty
water
have
received
attention
from
dalton
and
others
and
have
been
attributed
to
whirlwinds
from
the
sea
this
is
so
reasonably
contested
as
to
places
not
far
from
the
sea
but
the
fall
of
salt
that
occurred
high
in
the
mountains
of
switzerland
we
could
have
predicted
that
that
datum
could
be
found
somewhere
let
anything
be
explained
in
local
terms

the
coast
of

also
has
it
occurred
high
in

large
crystals
of
salt
fell
in
a
hailstorm
in

the
orthodox
explanation
is
a
crime
whoever
made
it
should
have
had
his
taken
we
are
told
rec
that
these
objects
of
salt
came
over
the
mediterranean
from

part
of

own
notion
is
that

became
so
nearly
a
real
prophet
that
he
was
translated
to

to

such
velocity
that
he
left
an
incandescent

behind
him

we
go
along
we
shall
find
the
true
test
of

material
which
in
the
past
has
been
taken
as
an
absolute
dissolving
into
almost
utmost
nebulosity
bastian
explains
mechanically
or
in
terms
of
the
usual
reflexes
to
all
reports
of
unwelcome
substances
that
near
where
the

had
been
found
telegraph
wires
had
been
struck
by

that

of
melted

had
been
seen
to
fall
near
the

which
had
been
on

in
the
first
place
but
according
to
the
york
april
about
two
bushels
of
this
substance
had
fallen

that
was
said
to
have
fallen
at

listed
by
greg

as
only

that
in
a

stone
was
found
far
in
the
interior
of
a
tree
in
battersea
fields
sometimes
cannon
balls
are
found
embedded
in
trees
does
seem
to
be
anything
to
discuss
does
seem
discussable
that
any
one
would
cut
a
hole
in
a
tree
and
hide
a
cannon
ball
which
one
could
take
to
bed
and
hide
under
one
pillow
just
as
easily
so
with
the
stone
of
battersea
fields
what
is
there
to
say
except
that
it
fell
with
high
velocity
and
embedded
in
the
tree
nevertheless
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
because
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
as
if
broken
off
the
stone
fragments
of
slag
were
found
i
have
nine
other
instances
slag
and
cinders
and
ashes
and
you
wo
believe
and
neither
will
i
that
they
came
from
the
furnaces
of
vast
aerial
we
see
what
looks
acceptable
as
to
ashes
the
difficulties
are
great
because
we
expect
many
falls
of
terrestrially
derived
ashes
volcanoes
and
forest
fires
in
some
of
our
acceptances
i
have
felt
a
little
radical
i
suppose
that
one
of
our
main
motives
is
to
show
that
there
is
in
nothing
but
the
preposterous
or
something
intermediate
to
absolute
preposterousness
and
final
reasonableness
that
the
new
is
the
obviously
preposterous
that
it
becomes
the
established
and
disguisedly
preposterous
that
it
is
displaced
after
a
while
and
is
again
seen
to
be
the
preposterous
or
that
all
progress
is
from
the
outrageous
to
the
academic
or
sanctified
and
back
to
the
outrageous
modified
however
by
a
trend
of
higher
and
higher
approximation
to
the
impreposterous
sometimes
i
feel
a
little
more
uninspired
than
at
other
times
but
i
think
we
pretty
well
accustomed
now
to
the
oneness
of
allness
or
that
the
methods
of
science
in
maintaining
its
system
are
as
outrageous
as
the
attempts
of
the
damned
to
break
in
in
the
record
of
daubr√©e
is
quoted
that
ashes
that
had
fallen
in

had
come
from

there

toward

found

about

deal
in

this
account
is
from

something
fell
from

it

luminously
with

report
and
scattered
in

a
fragment
that
was

by

is
described
by
him
as
having
the
appearance
of
a
piece
of
common
wood
charcoal
nevertheless
the
reassured
feeling
of
the
faithful
upon
reading
this
is
burdened
with
data
of
differences
the
substance
was
so
uncommonly
heavy
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
had
iron
in
it
also
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
sulphur
this
material
is
said
by
to
be
totally
unlike
that
of
any
other
meteorite
greg
in
his

brit
calls
it
a
more
than
doubtful
substance
but
again
against
reassurance
that
is
not

of
authenticity
greg
says
that
it
is
like
compact
charcoal
with
particles
of
sulphur
and
iron
pyrites
embedded
reassurance
rises
again
says
it
contains
also
charcoal
which
might
perhaps
be
acquired
from
matter
among
which
it
fell
this
is
a
common
reflex
with
the
exclusionists
that
substances
not
truly
meteoritic
did
not
fall
from
the
sky
but
were
picked
up
by
truly
meteoritic
things
of

only
on
their
surfaces
by
impact
with
this
earth
rhythm
of
reassurances
and
their

according
to

this

was
not
merely
coated
with
charcoal
his
analysis
gives
per

our
acceptance
that

that

to
the
admission
that
carbonaceous

has
been
found
in
meteorites
in
very
minute
quantities
or
my
own
suspicion
is
that
it
is
possible
to
damn
something
else
only
by
losing
one
own
soul
of
course
that
the
substance
that
fell
at
the
cape
of

hope
resembled
a
piece
of
anthracite
coal
more
than
anything
else
it
a
mistake
i
think
the
resemblance
is
to
bituminous
coal
but
it
is
from
the
periodicals
that
we
must
get
our
data
to
the
writers
of
books
upon
meteorites
it
would
be
as
wicked
by
which
we
mean
departure
from
the
characters
of
an
established
species
of
course
to
say
that
coal
has
fallen
from
the
sky
as
would
be
to
something
in
a
barnyard
a
temptation
that
it
climb
a
tree
and
catch
a
bird
domestic
things
in
a
barnyard
and
how
wild
things
from
forests
outside
seem
to
them
or
the
homeopathist
but
we
shall
shovel
data
of
coal
and
if
over
and
over
we
shall
learn
of
masses
of
soft
coal
that
have
fallen
upon
this
earth
if
in
no
instance
has
it
been
asserted
that
the
masses
did
not
fall
but
were
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
if
we
have
many
instances
this
time
we
turn
down
good
and
hard
the
mechanical
reflex
that
these
masses
were
carried
from
one
place
to
another
in
whirlwinds
because
we
find
it
too
difficult
to
accept
that
whirlwinds
could
so
select
or
so
specialize
in
a
peculiar
substance
among
writers
of
books
the
only
one
i
know
of
who
makes
more
than
brief
mention
is
sir
robert
ball
he
represents
a
still
more
antique
orthodoxy
or
is
an
exclusionist
of
the
old
type
still
holding
out
against
even
meteorites
he
cites
several
falls
of
carbonaceous
matter
but
with
disregards
that
make
for
reasonableness
that
earthy
matter
may
have
been
caught
up
by
whirlwinds
and
flung
down
somewhere
else
if
he
had
given
a
full
list
he
would
be
called
upon
to
explain
the
special
affinity
of
whirlwinds
for
a
special
kind
of
coal
he
does
not
give
a
full
list
we
shall
have
all
that
findable
and
we
shall
see
that
against
this
disease
writing
the
homeopathist
prescription
availeth
not
another
exclusionist
was
lawrence
smith
his
was
to
respond
to
all
reports
of
carbonaceous
matter
falling
from
the
sky
by
saying
that
this
damned
matter
had
been
deposited
upon
things
of
the
chosen
by
impact
with
this
earth
most
of
our
data
antedate
him
or
were
contemporaneous
with
him
or
were
as
accessible
to
him
as
to
us
in
his
attempted
positivism
it
is
simply
and
beautifully
disregarded
that
according
to
berthelot
berzelius
cloez
wohler
and
others
these
masses
are
not
merely
coated
with
carbonaceous
matter
but
are
carbonaceous
throughout
or
are
permeated
throughout
how
anyone
could
so
resolutely
and
dogmatically
and
beautifully
and
blindly
hold
out
would
puzzle
us
were
it
not
for
our
acceptance
that
only
to
think
is
to
exclude
and
include
and
to
exclude
some
things
that
have
as
much
right
to
come
in
as
have
the
included
that
to
have
an
opinion
upon
any
subject
is
to
be
a
lawrence
smith
because
there
is
no
definite
subject
walter
flight
says
of
the
substance
that
fell
near
alais
france
march
that
it
emits
a
faint
bituminous
substance
when
heated
according
to
the
observations
of
bergelius
and
a
commission
appointed
by
the
french
academy
this
time
we
have
not
the
reluctances
expressed
in
such
words
as
like
and
resembling
we
are
told
that
this
substance
is
an
earthy
kind
of
coal
as
to
minute
quantities
we
are
told
that
the
substance
that
fell
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
has
in
it
a
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
organic
matter
which
in
alcohol
gives
the
familiar
reaction
of
yellow
resinous
matter
other
instances
given
by
dr
flight
are
carbonaceous
matter
that
fell
in
in
tennessee
cranbourne
australia
montauban
france
may
twenty
masses
some
of
them
as
large
as
a
human

of
a
substance
that
resembled
a
earthy
lignite

about
about
per

of
a

france
july
substance
with
an
organic
combustible
ingredient
at
hessle
sweden
that
according
to
daubr√©e
the
substance
that
had
fallen
in
the
argentine
republic
resembled
certain
kinds
of
lignite
and
boghead
coal
in
it
is
said
that
this
mass
fell
june
in
the
province
entre
r√≠os
argentina
that
it
is
like
brown
coal
that
it
resembles
all
the
other
carbonaceous
masses
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
something
that
fell
at
grazac
france
when
burned
it
gave
out
a
bituminous

carbonaceous

that
fell
at
rajpunta

very

of
its

of

that
june
a
very

of

black
fell
at

it
contained

which
when
powdered
and
digested
in
alcohol
yielded
after
evaporation
a
bright
yellow

in
this
mass
was
per
cent
of
an
unknown
mineral
cinders
and
ashes
and
slag
and
coke
and
charcoal
and
coal
and
the
things
that
sometimes
fishes
are
bumped
by
reluctances
and
the
disguises
or
covered
retreats
of
such
words
as
like
and
resemble
or
that
conditions
of
intermediateness
forbid
abrupt
transitions
but
that
the
spirit
animating
all
intermediateness
is
to
achieve
abrupt
transitions
because
if
anything
could
finally
break
away
from
its
origin
and
environment
that
would
be
a
real
thing
something
not
merging
away
indistinguishably
with
the
surrounding
so
all
attempt
to
be
original
all
attempt
to
invent
something
that
is
more
than
mere
extension
or
modification
of
the
preceding
is
positivism
or
that
if
one
could
conceive
of
a
device
to
catch
flies
positively
different
from
or
unrelated
to
all
other
devices
up
he
shoot
to
heaven
or
the
positive
absolute
leaving
behind
such
an
incandescent
train
that
in
one
age
it
would
be
said
that
he
had
gone
aloft
in
a
fiery
chariot
and
in
another
age
that
he
had
been
struck
by
lightning
i
collecting
notes
upon
persons
supposed
to
have
been
struck
by
lightning
i
think
that
high
approximation
to
positivism
has
often
been
achieved
instantaneous
translation
residue
of
negativeness
left
behind
looking
much
like
effects
of
a
stroke
of
lightning
some
day
i
shall
tell
the
story
of
the
properly
as
the
american
would
say
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
sea
captain
his
family
and
the
crew
of
positivists
by
the
route
of
abrupt
transition
i
think
that
manet
was
notable
but
that
his
approximation
was
held
down
by
his
intense
relativity
to
the
public
or
that
it
is
quite
as
impositive
to
flout
and
insult
and
defy
as
it
is
to
crawl
and
placate
of
course
manet
began
with
continuity
with
courbet
and
others
and
then
between
him
and
manet
there
were
mutual
influences
but
the
spirit
of
abrupt
difference
is
the
spirit
of
positivism
and
manet
stand
was
against
the
dictum
that
all
lights
and
shades
must
merge
away
suavely
into
one
another
and
prepare
for
one
another
so
a
biologist
like
de
vries
represents
positivism
or
the
breaking
of
continuity
by
trying
to
conceive
of
evolution
by
mutation
against
the
dogma
of
indistinguishable
gradations
by
minute
variations
a
copernicus
conceives
of
continuity
is
against
him
he
is
not
permitted
to
break
abruptly
with
the
past
he
is
permitted
to
publish
his
work
but
only
as
an
interesting
hypothesis
continuity
and
that
all
that
we
call
evolution
or
progress
is
attempt
to
break
away
from
it
that
our
whole
solar
system
was
at
one
time
attempt
by
planets
to
break
away
from
a
parental
nexus
and
set
up
as
individualities
and
failing
move
in
orbits
that
are
expressions
of
relations
with
the
sun
and
with
one
another
all
having
surrendered
being
now
in
a
higher
approximation
to
system
intermediateness
in
its
mineralogic
aspect
of
positivism
or
iron
that
strove
to
break
away
from
sulphur
and
oxygen
and
be
real
homogeneous
iron
failing
inasmuch
as
elemental
iron
exists
only
in
chemistry
intermediateness
in
its
biologic
aspect
of
positivism
or
the
wild
fantastic
grotesque
monstrous
things
it
conceived
of
sometimes
in
a
frenzy
of
effort
to
break
away
abruptly
from
all
preceding
types
but
failing
in
the
for
instance
or
only
caricaturing
an
antelope
all
things
break
one
relation
only
by
the
establishing
of
some
other
relation
all
things
cut
an
umbilical
cord
only
to
clutch
a
breast
so
the
fight
of
the
exclusionists
to
maintain
the
traditional
or
to
prevent
abrupt
transition
from
the
fighting
so
that
here
more
than
a
century
after
meteorites
were
included
no
other
notable
inclusion
has
been
made
except
that
of
cosmic
dust
data
of
which
nordenskiold
made
more
nearly
real
than
data
in
opposition
so
proctor
for
instance
fought
and
expressed
his
feeling
of
the
preposterous
against
sir
thomson
notions
of
arrival
upon
this
earth
of
organisms
on
meteorites
i
can
only
regard
it
as
a
jest
or
that
there
is
nothing
but
jest
or
something
intermediate
to
jest
and
tragedy
that
ours
is
not
an
existence
but
an
utterance
that
momus
is
imagining
us
for
the
amusement
of
the
gods
often
with
such
success
that
some
of
us
seem
almost
alive
like
characters
in
something
a
novelist
is
writing
which
often
to
considerable
degree
take
their
affairs
away
from
the
novelist
that
momus
is
imagining
us
and
our
arts
and
sciences
and
religions
and
is
narrating
or
picturing
us
as
a
satire
upon
the
gods
real
existence
because
with
many
of
our
data
of
coal
that
has
fallen
from
the
sky
as
accessible
then
as
they
are
now
and
with
the
scientific
pronouncement
that
coal
is
fossil
how
in
a
real
existence
by
which
we
mean
a
consistent
existence
or
a
state
in
which
there
is
real
intelligence
or
a
form
of
thinking
that
does
not
indistinguishably
merge
away
with
imbecility
could
there
have
been
such
a
row
as
that
which
was
raised
about
forty
years
ago
over
hahn
announcement
that
he
had
found
fossils
in
meteorites
accessible
to
anybody
at
that
time
that
the
substance
that
fell
at
kaba
hungary
april
contained
organic
matter
analagous
to
fossil
waxes
or
limestone
of
the
block
of
limestone
which
was
reported
to
have
fallen
at
middleburg
florida
it
is
said
that
though
something
had
been
seen
to
fall
in
an
old
cultivated
field
the
witnesses
who
ran
to
it
picked
up
something
that
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
the
writer
who
tells
us
this
with
the
usual
known
as
stupidity
but
unjustly
because
there
is
no
real
stupidity
thinks
he
can
think
of
a
stone
that
had
for
many
years
been
in
a
cultivated
field
but
that
had
never
been
seen
before
had
never
interfered
with
plowing
for
instance
he
is
earnest
and
unjarred
when
he
writes
that
this
stone
weighs
pounds
my
own
notion
founded
upon
my
own
experience
in
seeing
is
that
a
block
of
stone
weighing
pounds
might
be
in
one
parlor
twenty
years
virtually
unseen
but
not
in
an
old
cultivated
field
where
it
interfered
with
plowing
not
anywhere
if
it
interfered
hahn
said
that
he
had
found
fossils
in
meteorites
there
is
a
description
of
the
corals
sponges
shells
and
crinoids
all
of
them
microscopic
which
he
photographed
in
hahn
was
a
scientist
he
was
better
known
after
that
anybody
may
theorize
upon
other
worlds
and
conditions
upon
them
that
are
similar
to
our
own
conditions
if
his
notions
be
presented
undisguisedly
as
fiction
or
only
as
an
interesting
hypothesis
he
stir
up
no
prude
rages
but
hahn
said
definitely
that
he
had
found
fossils
in
specified
meteorites
also
he
published
photographs
of
them
his
book
is
in
the
new
york
public
library
in
the
reproductions
every
feature
of
some
of
the
little
shells
is
plainly
marked
if
they
not
shells
neither
are
things

the
striations
are
very
plain

sees

where

are

is

kind
of
man
whose
imagination
has
run

him
conservation
of
continuity
then
weinland
examined
hahn
specimens
he
gave
his
opinion
that
they
are
fossils
and
that
they
are
not
crystals
of
enstatite
as
asserted
by
smith
who
had
never
seen
them
the
damnation
of
denial
and
the
damnation
of
disregard
after
the
publication
of
weinland
findings
silence
the
living
things
that
have
come
down
to
this
earth
attempts
to
preserve
the
system
that
small
frogs
and
toads
for
instance
never
have
fallen
from
the
sky
but
were
on
the
ground
in
the
first
place
or
that
there
have
been
such
falls
up
from
one
place
in
a
whirlwind
and
down
in
another
were
there
some
especially
froggy
place
near
europe
as
there
is
an
especially
sandy
place
the
scientific
explanation
would
of
course
be
that
all
small
frogs
falling
from
the
sky
in
europe
come
from
that
center
of
frogeity
to
start
with
i
like
to
emphasize
something
that
i
am
permitted
to
see
because
i
am
still
primitive
or
intelligent
or
in
a
state
of
maladjustment
that
there
is
not
one
report
findable
of
a
fall
of
tadpoles
from
the
sky
as
to
there
in
the
first
place
see
for
accounts
of
small
frogs
or
toads
said
to
have
been
seen
to
fall
from
the
sky
the
writer
says
that
all
observers
were
mistaken
that
the
frogs
or
toads
must
have
fallen
from
trees
or
other
places
overhead
tremendous
number
of
little
toads
one
or
two
months
old
that
were
seen
to
fall
from
a
great
thick
cloud
that
appeared
suddenly
in
a
sky
that
had
been
cloudless
august
near
toulouse
france
according
to
a
letter
from
pontus
to
arago
many
instances
of
frogs
that
were
seen
to
fall
from
the
sky
and
accounts
of
such
falls
signed
by
witnesses
and
july
a
shower
of
frogs
which
darkened
the
air
and
covered
the
ground
for
a
long
distance
is
the
reported
result
of
a
recent
rainstorm
at
kansas
city
mo
as
to
having
been
there
in
the
first
place
little
frogs
found
in
london
after
a
heavy
storm
july
and
little
toads
found
in
a
desert
after
a
rainfall
and
to
start
with
i
do
not
deny
positively
the
conventional
explanation
of
up
and
down
i
think
that
there
may
have
been
such
occurrences
i
omit
many
notes
that
i
have
upon
indistinguishables
in
the
london
july
there
is
an
account
of
a
shower
of
twigs
and
leaves
and
tiny
toads
in
a
storm
upon
the
slopes
of
the
apennines
these
may
have
been
the
ejectamenta
of
a
whirlwind
i
add
however
that
i
have
notes
upon
two
other
falls
of
tiny
toads
in
one
in
france
and
one
in
tahiti
also
of
fish
in
scotland
but
in
the
phenomenon
of
the
apennines
the
mixture
seems
to
me
to
be
typical
of
the
products
of
a
whirlwind
the
other
instances
seem
to
me
to
be
typical
of
something
like
migration
their
great
numbers
and
their
homogeneity
over
and
over
in
these
annals
of
the
damned
occurs
the
datum
of
segregation
but
a
whirlwind
is
thought
of
as
a
condition
of
chaos
not
final
negativeness
of
course
weather
july
a
small
pond
in
the
track
of
the
cloud
was
sucked
dry
the
water
being
carried
over
the
adjoining
fields
together
with
a
large
quantity
of
soft
mud
which
was
scattered
over
the
ground
for
half
a
mile
around
it
is
so
easy
to
say
that
small
frogs
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
had
been
scooped
up
by
a
whirlwind
but
here
are
the
circumstances
of
a
scoop
in
the
there
is
no
regard
for
mud
d√©bris
from
the
bottom
of
a
pond
floating
vegetation
loose
things
from
the
shores
but
a
precise
picking
out
of
frogs
only
of
all
instances
i
have
that
attribute
the
fall
of
small
frogs
or
toads
to
whirlwinds
only
one
definitely
identifies
or
places
the
whirlwind
also
as
has
been
said
before
a
pond
going
up
would
be
quite
as
interesting
as
frogs
coming
down
whirlwinds
we
read
of
over
and
over
but
where
and
what
whirlwind
it
seems
to
me
that
anybody
who
had
lost
a
pond
would
be
heard
from
in
meteorological
a
fall
of
small
frogs
near
birmingham
england
june
is
attributed
to
a
specific
whirlwind
but
not
a
word
as
to
any
special
pond
that
had
contributed
and
something
that
strikes
my
attention
here
is
that
these
frogs
are
described
as
almost
white
i
afraid
there
is
no
escape
for
us
we
shall
have
to
give
to
civilization
upon
this
earth
some
new
worlds
places
with
white
frogs
in
them
upon
several
occasions
we
have
had
data
of
unknown
things
that
have
fallen
from
somewhere
but
something
not
to
be
overlooked
is
that
if
living
things
have
landed
alive
upon
this
earth
in
spite
of
all
we
think
we
know
of
the
accelerative
velocity
of
falling
bodies
and
have
propagated
why
the
exotic
becomes

i
find
that
i
have
another
note
upon
a
specific
hurricane
and
mag
of
nat
after
one
of
the
greatest
hurricanes
in
the
history
of
ireland
some
fish
were
found
as
far
as
yards
from
the
edge
of
a
lake
have
another
this
is
a
good
one
for
the
exclusionists
fall
of
fish
in
paris
said
that
a
neighboring
pond
had
been
blown
dry
date
not
given
but
i
have
seen
it
recorded
somewhere
else
the
fall
of
fishes
from
the
sky
is
that
which
occurred
at
mountain
ash
in
the
valley
of
abedare
glamorganshire
the
editor
of
the
having
published
a
report
of
a
fall
of
fishes
writes
i
am
continually
receiving
similar
accounts
of
frogs
and
fishes
but
in
all
the
volumes
of
the
i
can
find
only
two
reports
of
such
falls
there
is
nothing
to
conclude
other
than
that
hosts
of
data
have
been
lost
because
orthodoxy
does
not
look
favorably
upon
such
reports
the
weather
records
several
falls
of
fishes
in
the
united
states
but
accounts
of
these
reported
occurrences
are
not
findable
in
other
american
publications
nevertheless
the
treatment
by
the
of
the
fall
reported
from
mountain
ash
is
fair
first
appears
in
the
issue
of
a
letter
from
the
rev
john
griffith
vicar
of
abedare
asserting
that
the
fall
had
occurred
chiefly
upon
the
property
of
nixon
of
mountain
ash
upon
page
gray
of
the
british
museum
bristling
with
exclusionism
writes
that
some
of
these
fishes
which
had
been
sent
to
him
alive
were
very
young
minnows
he
says
on
reading
the
evidence
it
seems
to
me
most
probably
only
a
practical
joke
that
one
of
nixon
employees
had
thrown
a
pailful
of
water
upon
another
who
had
thought
fish
in
it
had
fallen
from
the
sky
had
dipped
up
a
pailful
from
a
brook
those
fishes
still
alive
were
exhibited
at
the
zoological
gardens
regent
park
the
editor
says
that
one
was
a
minnow
and
that
the
rest
were
sticklebacks
he
says
that
gray
explanation
is
no
doubt
right
but
upon
page
he
publishes
a
letter
from
another
correspondent
who
apologizes
for
opposing
so
high
an
authority
as
gray
but
says
that
he
had
obtained
some
of
these
fishes
from
persons
who
lived
at
a
considerable
distance
apart
or
considerably
out
of
range
of
the
playful
pail
of
water
according
to
the
the
fishes
themselves
had
fallen
by
pailfuls
if
these
fishes
were
not
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
we
base
our
objections
to
the
whirlwind
explanation
upon
two
data
that
they
fell
in
no
such
distribution
as
one
could
attribute
to
the
discharge
of
a
whirlwind
but
upon
a
narrow
strip
of
land
about
yards
long
and
yards
wide
the
other
datum
is
again
the
suggestion
that
at
first
seemed
so
incredible
but
for
which
support
is
piling
up
a
suggestion
of
a
stationary
source
overhead
that
ten
minutes
later
another
fall
of
fishes
occurred
upon
this
same
narrow
strip
of
land
even
arguing
that
a
whirlwind
may
stand
still
axially
it
discharges
tangentially
wherever
the
fishes
came
from
it
does
not
seem
thinkable
that
some
could
have
fallen
and
that
others
could
have
whirled
even
a
tenth
of
a
minute
then
falling
directly
after
the
first
to
fall
because
of
these
evil
circumstances
the
best
adaptation
was
to
laugh
the
whole
thing
off
and
say
that
someone
had
soused
someone
else
with
a
pailful
of
water
in
which
a
few
very
young
minnows
had
been
caught
up
in
the
london
march
is
a
letter
from
aaron
roberts
curate
of
peter
carmathon
in
this
letter
the
fishes
are
said
to
have
been
about
four
inches
long
but
there
is
some
question
of
species
i
think
myself
that
they
were
minnows
and
sticklebacks
some
persons
thinking
them
to
be
sea
fishes
placed
them
in
salt
water
according
to
roberts
the
effect
is
stated
to
have
been
almost
instantaneous
death
some
were
placed
in
fresh
water
these
seemed
to
thrive
well
as
to
narrow
distribution
we
are
told
that
the
fishes
fell
in
and
about
the
premises
of
mr
nixon
it
was
not
observed
at
the
time
that
any
fish
fell
in
any
other
part
of
the
neighborhood
save
in
the
particular
spot
mentioned
in
the
london
march
vicar
griffith
writes
an
account
the
roofs
of
some
houses
were
covered
with
them
in
this
letter
it
is
said
that
the
largest
fishes
were
five
inches
long
and
that
these
did
not
survive
the
fall
of
the
british
the
evidence
of
the
fall
of
fish
on
this
occasion
was
very
conclusive
a
specimen
of
the
fish
was
exhibited
and
was
found
to
be
the
is
the
stickleback
altogether
i
think
we
have
not
a
sense
of
total
perdition
when
damned
with
the
explanation
that
someone
soused
someone
else
with
a
pailful
of
water
in
which
were
thousands
of
fishes
four
or
five
inches
long
some
of
which
covered
roofs
of
houses
and
some
of
which
remained
ten
minutes
in
the
air
by
way
of
contrast
we
offer
our
own
acceptance
that
the
bottom
of
a
pond
had
dropped
out
i
have
a
great
many
notes
upon
the
fall
of
fishes
despite
the
difficulty
these
records
have
in
getting
themselves
published
but
i
pick
out
the
instances
that
especially
relate
to
our
acceptances
or
to
the
principles
of
or
data
of
things
that
have
been
in
the
air
longer
than
acceptably
could
a
whirlwind
carry
them
that
have
fallen
with
a
distribution
narrower
than
is
attributable
to
a
whirlwind
that
have
fallen
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
upon
the
same
narrow
area
of
land
these
three
factors
indicate
somewhere
not
far
aloft
a
region
of
inertness
to
this
earth
gravitation
of
course
however
a
region
that
by
the
flux
and
variation
of
all
things
must
at
times
be
susceptible
but
afterward
our
heresy
will
bifurcate
in
amiable
accommodation
to
the
crucifixion
it
get
i
think
but
so
impressed
are
we
with
the
datum
that
though
there
have
been
many
reports
of
small
frogs
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
not
one
report
upon
a
fall
of
tadpoles
is
findable
that
to
these
circumstances
another
adjustment
must
be
made
apart
from
our
three
factors
of
indication
an
extraordinary
observation
is
the
fall
of
living
things
without
injury
to
them
the
devotees
of
isaac
explain
that
they
fall
upon
thick
grass
and
so
survive
but
sir
james
emerson
tennant
in
his
of
tells
of
a
fall
of
fishes
upon
gravel
by
which
they
were
seemingly
uninjured
something
else
apart
from
our
three
main
interests
is
a
phenomenon
that
looks
like
what
one
might
call
an
alternating
series
of
falls
of
fishes

of
a
that
arises
here
disregarding

that
the

did
not
fall
from
the

that
they
were
found
upon
the
ground
after
torrential
rains
because
streams
had
overflowed
and
had
then
receded
in
the
region
of
inertness
that
we

we
can
conceive
of

a

ferrel
popular
tells
of
a
fall
of
living
fishes
some
of
them
having
been
placed
in
a
tank
where
they
survived
that
occurred
in
india
about
miles
south
of
calcutta
a
witness
of
this
fall
says
the
most
strange
thing
which
ever
struck
me
was
that
the
fish
did
not
fall
or
here
and
there
but
they
fell
in
a
straight
line
not
more
than
a
cubit
in
breadth
see
jour
that
according
to
testimony
taken
before
a
magistrate
a
fall
occurred
near
feridpoor
india
of
many
fishes
of
various
sizes
some
whole
and
fresh
and
others
mutilated
and
putrefying
our
reflex
to
those
who
would
say
that
in
the
climate
of
india
it
would
not
take
long
for
fishes
to
putrefy
is
that
high
in
the
air
the
climate
of
india
is
not
torrid
another
peculiarity
of
this
fall
is
that
some
of
the
fishes
were
much
larger
than
others
or
to
those
who
hold
out
for
segregation
in
a
whirlwind
or
that
objects
say
twice
as
heavy
as
others
would
be
separated
from
the
lighter
we
point
out
that
some
of
these
fishes
were
twice
as
heavy
as
others
in
the
of
the
asiatic
society
of
depositions
of
witnesses
are
given
some
of
the
fish
were
fresh
but
others
were
rotten
and
without
heads
among
the
number
which
i
got
five
were
fresh
and
the
rest
stinking
and
headless
they
remind
us
of
his
grace
observation
of
some
pages
back
according
to
buist
some
of
these
fishes
weighed
one
and
a
half
pounds
each
and
others
three
pounds

fall
of
fishes
at
futtepoor
india
may
they
were
all
dead
and
dry
buist
india
is
far
away
about
was
long
ago
a
correspondent
writes
from
the
dove
marine
laboratory
cuttercoats
england
that
at
hindon
a
suburb
of
sunderland
hundreds
of
small
fishes
identified
as
sand
eels
had
fallen
again
the
small
area
about
by
yards
the
fall
occurred
during
a
heavy
rain
that
was
accompanied
by
thunder
or
indications
of
disturbance
aloft
but
by
no
visible
lightning
the
sea
is
close
to
hindon
but
if
you
try
to
think
of
these
fishes
having
described
a
trajectory
in
a
whirlwind
from
the
ocean
consider
this
remarkable
datum
that
according
to
witnesses
the
fall
upon
this
small
area
occupied
ten
minutes
i
can
not
think
of
a
clearer
indication
of
a
direct
fall
from
a
stationary
source
and
the
fish
were
all
dead
and
indeed
stiff
and
hard
when
picked
up
immediately
after
the
occurrence
by
all
of
which
i
mean
that
we
have
only
begun
to
pile
up
our
data
of
things
that
fall
from
a
stationary
source
overhead
we
have
to
take
up
the
subject
from
many
approaches
before
our
acceptance
which
seems
quite
as
rigorously
arrived
at
as
ever
has
been
a
belief
can
emerge
from
the
accursed
i
do
know
how
much
the
horse
and
the
barn
will
help
us
to
emerge
but
if
ever
anything
did
go
up
from
this
earth
surface
and
stay
up
those
damned
things
may
have
weather
may
in
a
tornado
in
wisconsin
may
a
barn
and
a
horse
were
carried
completely
away
and
neither
horse
nor
barn
nor
any
portion
of
either
have
since
been
found
after
that
which
would
be
a
little
strong
were
it
not
for
a
steady
improvement
in
our
digestions
that
i
note
as
we
go
along
there
is
little
of
the
bizarre
or
the
unassimilable
in
the
turtle
that
hovered
six
months
or
so
over
a
small
town
in
mississippi
weather
may
that
may
at
vicksburg
fell
a
small
piece
of
alabaster
that
at
bovina
eight
miles
from
vicksburg
fell
a
gopher
turtle
they
fell
in
a
hailstorm
this

was
widely
copied
at
the

for
instance
one
of
the

roy
met
as
to
discussion
not
a
word
or
science
and
its
continuity
with
presbyterianism
data
like
this
are
damned
at
birth
the
does
sprinkle
or
baptize
or
attempt
to
save
this
infant
but
in
all
the
meteorological
literature
that
i
have
gone
through
after
that
date
not
a
word
except
mention
once
or
twice
the
editor
of
the
says
an
examination
of
the
weather
map
shows
that
these
hailstorms
occur
on
the
south
side
of
a
region
of
cold
northerly
winds
and
were
but
a
small
part
of
a
series
of
similar
storms
apparently
some
special
local
whirls
or
gusts
carried
heavy
objects
from
this
earth
surface
up
to
the
cloud
regions
of
all
incredibilities
that
we
have
to
choose
from
i
give
first
place
to
a
notion
of
a
whirlwind
pouncing
upon
a
region
and
scrupulously
selecting
a
turtle
and
a
piece
of
alabaster
this
time
the
other
mechanical
thing
there
in
the
first
place
can
not
rise
in
response
to
its
stimulus
it
is
resisted
in
that
these
objects
were
coated
with
ice
month
of
may
in
a
southern
state
if
a
whirlwind
at
all
there
must
have
been
very
limited
selection
there
is
no
record
of
the
fall
of
other
objects
but
there
is
no
attempt
in
the
to
specify
a
whirlwind
these
strangely
associated
things
were
remarkably
separated
they
fell
eight
miles
apart
then
as
if
there
were
real
reasoning
they
must
have
been
high
to
fall
with
such
divergence
or
one
of
them
must
have
been
carried
partly
horizontally
eight
miles
farther
than
the
other
but
either
supposition
argues
for
power
more
than
that
of
a
local
whirl
or
gust
or
argues
for
a
great
specific
disturbance
of
which
there
is
no
record
for
the
month
of
may
nevertheless
as
if
i
really
were
reasonable
i
do
feel
that
i
have
to
accept
that
this
turtle
had
been
raised
from
this
earth
surface
somewhere
near
vicksburg
because
the
gopher
turtle
is
common
in
the
southern
states
then
i
think
of
a
hurricane
that
occurred
in
the
state
of
mississippi
weeks
or
months
before
may
no
i
do
look
for
it
and
inevitably
find
it
or
that
things
can
go
up
so
high
in
hurricanes
that
they
stay
up
indefinitely
but
may
after
a
while
be
shaken
down
by
storms
over
and
over
have
we
noted
the
occurrence
of
strange
falls
in
storms
so
then
that
the
turtle
and
the
piece
of
alabaster
may
have
had
far
different
origins
from
different
worlds
perhaps
have
entered
a
region
of
suspension
over
this
earth
wafting
near
each
other
long
duration
final
precipitation
by
atmospheric
disturbance
with
hail
or
that
hailstones
too
when
large
are
phenomena
of
suspension
of
long
duration
that
it
is
highly
unacceptable
that
the
very
large
ones
could
become
so
great
only
in
falling
from
the
clouds
over
and
over
has
the
note
of
disagreeableness
or
of
putrefaction
been
struck
long
duration
other
indications
of
long
duration
i
think
of
a
region
somewhere
above
this
earth
surface
in
which
gravitation
is
inoperative
and
is
not
governed
by
the
square
of
the
distance
quite
as
magnetism
is
negligible
at
a
very
short
distance
from
a
magnet
theoretically
the
attraction
of
a
magnet
should
decrease
with
the
square
of
the
distance
but
the
is
found
to
be
almost
abrupt
at
a
short
distance
i
think
that
things
raised
from
this
earth
surface
to
that
region
have
been
held
there
until
shaken
down
by
storms
the
sea
derelicts
rubbish
old
cargoes
from
wrecks
things
cast
out
into
what
is
called
space
by
convulsions
of
other
planets
things
from
the
times
of
the
alexanders
caesars
and
napoleons
of

and

raised

and

i
prefer
to
take
one
simple
stand
orthodoxy
accepts
the
correlation
and
equivalence
of
forces
gravitation
is
one
of
these
forces
all
other
forces
have
phenomena
of
repulsion
and
of
inertness
irrespective
of
distance
as
well
as
of
attraction
but
newtonian
gravitation
admits
attraction
only
then
newtonian
gravitation
can
be
only
acceptable
even
to
the
orthodox
or
there
is
denial
of
the
correlation
and
equivalence
of
forces
or
still
simpler
here
are
the
data
make
what
you
will
yourself
of
them
in
our
intermediatist
revolt
against
homogeneous
or
positive
explanations
or
our
acceptance
that
the
can
not
be
less
than
universality
besides
which
however
there
would
be
nothing
to
suffice
our
expression
upon
the
sea
though
it
harmonizes
with
data
of
fishes
that
fall
as
if
from
a
stationary
source
and
of
course
with
other
data
too
is
inadequate
to
account
for
two
peculiarities
of
the
falls
of
frogs
that
never
has
a
fall
of
tadpoles
been
reported
that
never
has
a
fall
of
frogs
been
reported
always
frogs
a
few
months
old
it
sounds
positive
but
if
there
be
such
reports
they
are
somewhere
out
of
my
range
of
reading
but
tadpoles
would
be
more
likely
to
fall
from
the
sky
than
would
frogs
little
or
big
if
such
falls
be
attributed
to
whirlwinds
and
more
likely
to
fall
from
the
sea
if
though
very
tentatively
and
provisionally
we
accept
the
sea
before
we
take
up
an
especial
expression
upon
the
fall
of
immature
and
larval
forms
of
life
to
this
earth
and
the
necessity
then
of
conceiving
of
some
factor
besides
mere
stationariness
or
suspension
or
stagnation
there
are
other
data
that
are
similar
to
data
of
falls
of
fishes
that
small
snails
of
a
land
species
had
fallen
near
redruth
cornwall
july
during
a
heavy
thunderstorm
roads
and
fields
strewn
with
them
so
that
they
were
gathered
up
by
the
hatful
none
seen
to
fall
by
the
writer
of
this
account
snails
said
to
be
quite
different
to
any
previously
known
in
this
district
but
upon
page
we
have
better
orthodoxy
another
correspondent
writes
that
he
had
heard
of
the
supposed
fall
of
snails
that
he
had
supposed
that
all
such
stories
had
gone
the
way
of
witch
stories
that
to
his
astonishment
he
had
read
an
account
of
this
absurd
story
in
a
local
newspaper
of
great
and
deserved
repute
i
thought
i
should
for
once
like
to
trace
the
origin
of
one
of
these
fabulous
tales
our
own
acceptance
is
that
justice
can
not
be
in
an
intermediate
existence
in
which
there
can
be
approximation
only
to
justice
or
to
injustice
that
to
be
fair
is
to
have
no
opinion
at
all
that
to
be
honest
is
to
be
uninterested
that
to
investigate
is
to
admit
prejudice
that
nobody
has
ever
really
investigated
anything
but
has
always
sought
positively
to
prove
or
to
disprove
something
that
was
conceived
of
or
suspected
in
advance
as
i
suspected
says
this
correspondent
i
found
that
the
snails
were
of
a
familiar
that
they
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
he
found
that
the
snails
had
appeared
after
the
rain
that
astonished
rustics
had
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
fallen
he
met
one
person
who
said
that
he
had
seen
the
snails
fall
this
was
his
error
says
the
investigator
in
the
there
is
an
account
of
snails
said
to
have
fallen
at
bristol
in
a
field
of
three
acres
in
such
quantities
that
they
were
shoveled
up
it
is
said
that
the
snails
may
be
considered
as
a
local
species
upon
page
another
correspondent
says
that
the
numbers
had
been
exaggerated
and
that
in
his
opinion
they
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
but
that
there
had
been
some
unusual
condition
aloft
comes
out
in
his
observation
upon
the
curious
appearance
of
the
sun
at
the
time
that
according
to
december
upon
a
yellow
cloud
appeared
over
paderborn
germany
from
this
cloud
fell
a
torrential
rain
in
which
were
hundreds
of
mussels
there
is
no
mention
of
whatever
may
have
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
nor
of
a
whirlwind
lizards
said
to
have
fallen
on
the
sidewalks
of
montreal
canada
and
in
the
a
correspondent
writes
from
south
granville
that
during
a
heavy
shower
july
he
heard
a
peculiar
sound
at
his
feet
and
looking
down
saw
a
snake
lying
as
if
stunned
by
a
fall
it
then
came
to
life
gray
snake
about
a
foot
long
these
data
have
any
meaning
or
lack
of
meaning
or
degree
of
damnation
you
please
but
in
the
matter
of
the
fall
that
occurred
at
memphis
tennessee
occur
some
strong
significances
our
upon
this
subject
applies
to
all
segregations
so
far
considered
weather
that
in
memphis
rather
strictly
localized
or
in
a
space
of
two
blocks
and
after
a
violent
storm
in
which
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
snakes
were
found
they
were
crawling
on
sidewalks
in
yards
and
in
streets
and
in
masses
but
none
were
found
on
roofs
or
any
other
elevation
above
ground
and
none
were
seen
to
fall
if
you
prefer
to
believe
that
the
snakes
had
always
been
there
or
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
and
that
it
was
only
that
something
occurred
to
call
special
attention
to
them
in
the
streets
of
memphis
why
that
sensible
that
the
common
sense
that
has
been
against
us
from
the
first
it
is
not
said
whether
the
snakes
were
of
a
known
species
or
not
but
that
when
first
seen
they
were
of
a
dark
brown
almost
black
blacksnakes
i
suppose
if
we
accept
that
these
snakes
did
fall
even
though
not
seen
to
fall
by
all
the
persons
who
were
out
in
a
violent
storm
and
had
not
been
in
the
streets
crawling
loose
or
in
thick
tangled
masses
in
the
first
place
if
we
try
to
accept
that
these
snakes
had
been
raised
from
some
other
part
of
this
earth
surface
in
a
whirlwind
if
we
try
to
accept
that
a
whirlwind
could
segregate
them
we
accept
the
segregation
of
other
objects
raised
in
that
whirlwind
then
near
the
place
of
origin
there
would
have
been
a
fall
of
heavier
objects
that
had
been
snatched
up
with
the
snakes
stones
fence
rails
limbs
of
trees
say
that
the
snakes
occupied
the
next
gradation
and
would
be
the
next
to
fall
still
farther
would
there
have
been
separate
falls
of
lightest
objects
leaves
twigs
tufts
of
grass
in
the
weather
there
is
no
mention
of
other
falls
said
to
have
occurred
anywhere
in
january
again
ours
is
the
objection
against
such
selectiveness
by
a
whirlwind
conceivably
a
whirlwind
could
scoop
out
a
den
of
hibernating
snakes
with
stones
and
earth
and
an
infinitude
of
other
d√©bris
snatching
up
dozens
of
snakes
i
do
know
how
many
to
a
den
hundreds
maybe
but
according
to
the
account
of
this
occurrence
in
the
york
there
were
thousands
of
them
alive
from
one
foot
to
eighteen
inches
in
length
the
records
the
fall
and
says
that
there
were
thousands
of
them
the
usual
is
given
but
in
what
locality
snakes
exist
in
such
abundance
is
yet
a
mystery
this
matter
of
enormousness
of
numbers
suggests
to
me
something
of
a
migratory
nature
but
that
snakes
in
the
united
states
do
not
migrate
in
the
month
of
january
if
ever
as
to
falls
or
flutterings
of
winged
insects
from
the
sky
prevailing
notions
of
swarming
would
seem
explanatory
enough
nevertheless
in
instances
of
ants
there
are
some
peculiar
circumstances
fall
of
fishes
june
in
holland
ants
strasbourg
little
toads
savoy
fall
of
ants
cambridge
england
summer
of
some
were
wingless
enormous
fall
of
ants
nancy
france
july
most
of
them
were
wingless
fall
of
enormous
unknown
ants
size
of
wasps
manitoba
june
however
our
expression
will
be
that
wingless
larval
forms
of
life
in
numbers
so
enormous
that
migration
from
some
place
external
to
this
earth
is
suggested
have
fallen
from
the
sky
that
these
migrations
if
such
can
be
our
acceptance
have
occurred
at
a
time
of
hibernation
and
burial
far
in
the
ground
of
larvae
in
the
northern
latitudes
of
this
earth
that
there
is
significance
in
recurrence
of
these
falls
in
the
last
of
january
or
that
we
have
the
square
of
an
incredibility
in
such
a
notion
as
that
of
selection
of
larvae
by
whirlwinds
compounded
with
selection
of
the
last
of
january
i
accept
that
there
are
snow
worms
upon
this
earth
whatever
their
origin
may
have
been
in
the
acad
nat
sci
of
there
is
a
description
of
yellow
worms
and
black
worms
that
have
been
found
together
on
glaciers
in
alaska
almost
positively
were
there
no
other
forms
of
upon
these
glaciers
and
there
was
no
vegetation
to
support
except
microscopic
organisms
nevertheless
the
description
of
this
probably
polymorphic
species
fits
a
description
of
larvae
said
to
have
fallen
in
switzerland
and
less
definitely
fits
another
description
there
is
no
opposition
here
if
our
data
of
falls
are
clear
frogs
of
ponds
look
like
frogs
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
except
the
whitish
frogs
of
birmingham
however
all
falls
of
larvae
have
not
positively
occurred
in
the
last
of
january
london
april
that
in
the
parish
of
bramford
speke
devonshire
a
large
number
of
black
worms
about
of
an
inch
in
length
had
fallen
in
a
snowstorm
in
timb
it
is
said
that
in
the
winter
of
at
christiania
norway
worms
were
found
crawling
upon
the
ground
the
occurrence
is
considered
a
great
mystery
because
the
worms
could
not
have
come
up
from
the
ground
inasmuch
as
the
ground
was
frozen
at
the
time
and
because
they
were
reported
from
other
places
also
in
norway
immense
number
of
black
insects
in
a

of

found
in

upon

inches
thick

the
writer
thinks
that
the
worms
had
been
brought
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
by
rain
which
had
fallen
previously
a
puzzling
phenomenon
has
been
noted
frequently
in
some
parts
of
the
valley
bend
district
randolph
county
this
winter
the
crust
of
the
snow
has
been
covered
two
or
three
times
with
worms
resembling
the
ordinary
cut
worms
where
they
come
from
unless
they
fall
with
the
snow
is
inexplicable
in
the
march
the
editor
says
that
similar
worms
had
been
seen
upon
the
snow
near
utica
and
in
oneida
and
herkimer
counties
that
some
of
the
worms
had
been
sent
to
the
department
of
agriculture
at
washington
again
two
species
or
polymorphism
according
to
riley
it
was
not
polymorphism
but
two
distinct
species
which
because
of
our
data
we
doubt
one
kind
was
larger
than
the
other
not
distinctly
stated
one
is
called
the
larvae
of
the
common
soldier
beetle
and
the
other
seems
to
be
a
variety
of

said
to

common
in

of

in

pour
it
is
said
that
with
these
larvae
there
were
developed
insects
that
upon
the
last
of

there
fell
in
a
great
tempest
in
switzerland
incalculable
numbers
of
larvae
some
black
and
some
yellow
numbers
so
great
that
hosts
of
birds
were
attracted
altogether
we
regard
this
as
one
of
our
neatest
expressions
for
external
origins
and
against
the
whirlwind
explanation
if
an
exclusionist
says
that
in
january
larvae
were
precisely
and
painstakingly
picked
out
of
frozen
ground
in
incalculable
numbers
he
thinks
of
a
tremendous
force
disregarding
its
refinements
then
if
origin
and
precipitation
be
not
far
apart
what
becomes
of
an
infinitude
of
other
d√©bris
conceiving
of
no
time
for
segregation
if
he
thinks
of
a
long
translation
all
the
way
from
the
south
of
france
to
upper
savoy
he
may
think
then
of
a
very
fine
sorting
over
by
differences
of
specific
gravity
but
in
such
a
fine
selection
larvae
would
be
separated
from
developed
insects
as
to
differences
in
specific
gravity
the
yellow
larvae
that
fell
in
switzerland
january
were
three
times
the
size
of
the
black
larvae
that
fell
with
them
in
accounts
of
this
occurrence
there
is
no
denial
of
the
fall
or
that
a
whirlwind
never
brought
them
together
and
held
them
together
and
precipitated
them
and
only
them
together
that
they
came
from
genesistrine
there
no
escape
from
it
we
be
persecuted
for
it
take
it
or
leave
it
genesistrine
the
notion
is
that
there
is
somewhere
aloft
a
place
of
origin
of
life
relatively
to
this
earth
whether
it
the
planet
genesistrine
or
the
moon
or
a
vast
amorphous
region
to
this
earth
or
an
island
in
the
sea
should
perhaps
be
left
to
the
researches
of
other
super
or
extra
geographers
that
the
first
unicellular
organisms
may
have
come
here
from
genesistrine
or
that
men
or
anthropomorphic
beings
may
have
come
here
before
amoebae
that
upon
genesistrine
there
may
have
been
an
evolution
expressible
in
conventional
biologic
terms
but
that
evolution
upon
this
earth
has
been
like
evolution
in
modern
japan
induced
by
external
influences
that
evolution
as
a
whole
upon
this
earth
has
been
a
process
of
population
by
immigration
or
by
bombardment
some
notes
i
have
upon
remains
of
men
and
animals
encysted
or
covered
with
clay
or
stone
as
if
fired
here
as
projectiles
i
omit
now
because
it
seems
best
to
regard
the
whole
phenomenon
as
a
tropism
as
a
geotropism
probably
atavistic
or
vestigial
as
it
were
or
something
still
continuing
long
after
expiration
of
necessity
that
once
upon
a
time
all
kinds
of
things
came
here
from
genesistrine
but
that
now
only
a
few
kinds
of
bugs
and
things
at
long
intervals
feel
the
inspiration
not
one
instance
have
we
of
tadpoles
that
have
fallen
to
this
earth
it
seems
reasonable
that
a
whirlwind
could
scoop
up
a
pond
frogs
and
all
and
cast
down
the
frogs
somewhere
else
but
then
more
reasonable
that
a
whirlwind
could
scoop
up
a
pond
tadpoles
and
all
because
tadpoles
are
more
numerous
in
their
season
than
are
the
frogs
in
theirs
but
the
is
earlier
in
the
spring
or
in
a
time
that
is
more
tempestuous
thinking
in
terms
of
causation
as
if
there
were
real
causes
our
notion
is
that
if
x
is
likely
to
cause
y
but
is
more
likely
to

x
is
not
the
cause
of

upon
this
we
base
our
acceptance
that
the
little
frogs
that
have
fallen
to
this
earth
are
not
products
of
whirlwinds
that
they
came
from
externality
or
from
genesistrine
i
think
of
genesistrine
in
terms
of
biologic
mechanics
not
that
somewhere
there
are
persons
who
collect
bugs
in
or
about
the
last
of
january
and
frogs
in
july
and
august
and
bombard
this
earth
any
more
than
do
persons
go
through
northern
regions
catching
and
collecting
birds
every
autumn
then
casting
them
southward
but
atavistic
or
vestigial
geotropism
in
genesistrine
or
a
million
larvae
start
crawling
and
a
million
little
frogs
start
hopping
knowing
no
more
what
it
all
about
than
we
do
when
we
crawl
to
work
in
the
morning
and
hop
away
at
night
i
should
say
myself
that
genesistrine
is
a
region
in
the
sea
and
that
parts
of
the
sea
have
rhythms
of
susceptibility
to
this
earth
attraction
i
accept
that
when
there
are
storms
the
damnedest
of
excluded
excommunicated
things
things
that
are
leprous
to
the
faithful
are
brought
down
from
the
sea
or
from
what
for
convenience
we
call
the
sea
which
by
no
means
has
been
taken
into
full
acceptance
yet
that
things
are
brought
down
by
storms
just
as
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
things
are
brought
up
by
storms
to
be
sure
it
is
orthodoxy
that
storms
have
little
if
any
effect
below
the
waves
of
the
ocean
but
of
course
only
to
have
an
opinion
is
to
be
ignorant
of
or
to
disregard
a
contradiction
or
something
else
that
modifies
an
opinion
out
of
distinguishability
meteorological
that
along
the
coast
of
new
zealand
in
regions
not
subject
to
submarine
volcanic
action
fishes
are
often
brought
up
by
storms
iron
and
stones
that
fall
from
the
sky
and
atmospheric
disturbances
there
is
absolutely
no
connection
between
the
two
phenomena
the
orthodox
belief
is
that
objects
moving
at
planetary
velocity
would
upon
entering
this
earth
atmosphere
be
virtually
unaffected
by
hurricanes
might
as
well
think
of
a
bullet
swerved
by
someone
fanning
himself
the
only
trouble
with
the
orthodox
reasoning
is
the
usual
trouble
its
its
basing
upon
a
myth
data
we
had
and
more
we
have
of
things
in
the
sky
having
no
independent
velocity
there
are
so
many
storms
and
so
many
meteors
and
meteorites
that
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
there
were
no
concurrences
nevertheless
so
many
of
these
concurrences
are
listed
by
brit
that
one
notices
see
brit
other
instances
the
famous
fall
of
stones
at
siena

violent
storm
see
many
instances
one
that
stands
out
is
bright
ball
of
fire
and
light
in
a
hurricane
in
england
the
remarkable
datum
here
is
that
this
phenomenon
was
visible
forty
minutes
that
about
times
the
duration
that
the
orthodox
give
to
meteors
and
meteorites
see
the
many
instances
in
and
the
london
something
that
fell
in
a
gale
of

described
as
a
huge
ball
of
green
fire
this
phenomenon
is
described
by
another
correspondent
in
and
an
account
of
it
by
another
correspondent
was
forwarded
to
by
denning
there
are
so
many
instances
that
some
of
us
will
revolt
against
the
insistence
of
the
faithful
that
it
is
only
coincidence
and
accept
that
there
is
connection
of
the
kind
called
causal
if
it
is
too
difficult
to
think
of
stones
and
metallic
masses
swerved
from
their
courses
by
storms
if
they
move
at
high
velocity
we
think
of
low
velocity
or
of
things
having
no
velocity
at
all
hovering
a
few
miles
above
this
earth
dislodged
by
storms
and
falling
luminously
but
the
resistance
is
so
great
here
and
coincidence
so
insisted
upon
that
we
better
have
some
more
instances

nevertheless
in
it
is
said
that
though

have

no
connection
is
supposed
to
exist
between
the
two
phenomena
except
by
the
ignorant
peasantry
but
some
of
us
peasants
have
gone
through
the
of
the
british
upon
page
buist
who
had
never
heard
of
the
sea
says
that
though
it
is
difficult
to
trace
connection
between
the
phenomena
three
aerolites
had
fallen
in

months
in
india
during

may
have
been
for
accounts
by
witnesses
see
page
of
the
or
we
are
on
our
way
to
account
for
thunderstones
it
seems
to
me
that
very
strikingly
here
is
borne
out
the
general
acceptance
that
ours
is
only
an
intermediate
existence
in
which
there
is
nothing
fundamental
or
nothing
final
to
take
as
a
positive
standard
to
judge
by
peasants
believed
in
meteorites
scientists
excluded
meteorites
peasants
believe
in
thunderstones
scientists
exclude
thunderstones
it
is
useless
to
argue
that
peasants
are
out
in
the
fields
and
that
scientists
are
shut
up
in
laboratories
and
lecture
rooms
we
can
not
take
for
a
real
base
that
as
to
phenomena
with
which
they
are
more
familiar
peasants
are
more
likely
to
be
right
than
are
scientists
a
host
of
biologic
and
meteorologic
fallacies
of
peasants
rises
against
us
i
should
say
that
our
existence
is
like
a
bridge
except
that
that
comparison
is
in
static
terms
but
like
the
brooklyn
bridge
upon
which
multitudes
of
bugs
are
seeking
a
fundamental
coming
to
a
girder
that
seems
firm
and
final
but
the
girder
is
built
upon
supports
a
support
then
seems
final
but
it
is
built
upon
underlying
structures
nothing
final
can
be
found
in
all
the
bridge
because
the
bridge
itself
is
not
a
final
thing
in
itself
but
is
a
relationship
between
manhattan
and
brooklyn
if
our
existence
is
a
relationship
between
the
positive
absolute
and
the
negative
absolute
the
quest
for
finality
in
it
is
hopeless
everything
in
it
must
be
relative
if
the
whole
is
not
a
whole
but
is
itself
a
relation
in
the
attitude
of
acceptance
our
is
cells
of
an
embryo
are
in
the
reptilian
era
of
the
embryo
some
cells
feel
stimuli
to
take
on
new
appearances
if
it
be
of
the
design
of
the
whole
that
the
next
era
be
mammalian
those
cells
that
turn
mammalian
will
be
sustained
against
resistance
by
inertia
of
all
the
rest
and
will
be
relatively
right
though
not
finally
right
because
they
too
in
time
will
have
to
give
way
to
characters
of
other
eras
of
higher
development
if
we
are
upon
the
verge
of
a
new
era
in
which
exclusionism
must
be
overthrown
it
will
avail
thee
not
to
call
us
and
frowsy
peasants
in
our
crude
bucolic
way
we
now
offer
an
outrage
upon
common
sense
that
we
think
will
some
day
be
an
unquestioned
commonplace
that
manufactured
objects
of
stone
and
iron
have
fallen
from
the
sky
that
they
have
been
brought
down
from
a
state
of
suspension
in
a
region
of
inertness
to
this
earth
attraction
by
atmospheric
disturbances
the
thunderstone
is
usually
a
beautifully
polished
piece
of
greenstone
says
a
writer
in
the
it
is
it
likely
to
be
of
almost
any
kind
of
stone
but
we
call
attention
to
the
skill
with
which
some
of
them
have
been
made
of
course
this
writer
says
it
all
superstition
otherwise
he
be
one
of
us
crude
and
simple
sons
of
the
soil
conventional
damnation
is
that
stone
implements
already
on
the
ground
on
the
ground
in
the
first
place
are
found
near
where
lightning
was
seen
to
strike
that
are
supposed
by
astonished
rustics
or
by
intelligence
of
a
low
order
to
have
fallen
in
or
with
lightning
throughout
this
book
we
class
a
great
deal
of
science
with
bad
fiction
when
is
fiction
bad
cheap
low
if
coincidence
is
overworked
one
way
of
deciding
but
with
single
writers
coincidence
seldom
is
overworked
we
find
the
excess
in
the
subject
at
large
such
a
writer
as
the
one
of
the
tells
us
vaguely
of
beliefs
of
peasants
there
is
no
massing
of
instance
after
instance
after
instance
here
ours
will
be
the
method
of
conceivably
lightning
may
strike
the
ground
near
where
there
was
a
object
in

first
place

again

we
grant
a
great
deal
but
note
a
tendency
to
restlessness
nevertheless
this
is
the
of
science
to
all
thunderstones
said
to
have
fallen
luminously
as
to
greenstone
it
is
in
the
island
of
jamaica
where
the
notion
is
general
that
axes
of
a
hard
greenstone
fall
from
the
sky
during
the
rains
inst
some
other
time
we
shall
inquire
into
this
localization
of
objects
of
a
specific
material
they
are
of
a
stone
nowhere
else
to
be
found
in
jamaica
and
in
my
own
tendency
to
exclude
or
in
the
attitude
of
one
peasant
or
savage
who
thinks
he
is
not
to
be
classed
with
other
peasants
or
savages
i
am
not
very
much
impressed
with
what
natives
think
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
why
if
the
word
of
a
lord
kelvin
carries
no
more
weight
upon
scientific
subjects
than
the
word
of
a
sitting
bull
unless
it
be
in
agreement
with
conventional
opinion
i
think
it
must
be
because
savages
have
bad
table
manners
however
my
snobbishness
in
this
respect
loosens
up
somewhat
before
very
widespread
belief
by
savages
and
peasants
and
the
notion
of
thunderstones
is
as
wide
as
geography
itself
the
natives
of
burma
china
japan
according
to
blinkenberg
not
of
course
that
blinkenberg
accepts
one
word
of
it
think
that
carved
stone
objects
have
fallen
from
the
sky
because
they
think
they
have
seen
such
objects
fall
from
the
sky
such
objects
are
called
thunderbolts
in
these
countries
they
are
called
thunderstones
in
moravia
holland
belgium
france
cambodia
sumatra
and
siberia
they
called
storm
stones
in
lausitz
sky
arrows
in
slavonia
thunder
axes
in
england
and
scotland
lightning
stones
in
spain
and
portugal
sky
axes
in
greece
lightning
flashes
in
brazil
thunder
teeth
in
amboina
the
belief
is
as
widespread
as
is
belief
in
ghosts
and
witches
which
only
the
superstitious
deny
today
as
to
beliefs
by
north
american
indians
tyler
gives
a
list
of
references
as
to
south
american
indians
certain
stone
hatchets
are
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
heavens
amer
folk
if
you
too
revolt
against
coincidence
after
coincidence
after
coincidence
but
find
our
interpretation
of
thunderstones
just
a
little
too
strong
or
rich
for
digestion
we
recommend
the
explanation
of
one
tallius
written
in
the
naturalists
say
they
are
generated
in
the
sky
by
fulgurous
exhalation
conglobed
in
a
cloud
by
the
circumfused
humor
of
course
the
paper
in
the
was
written
with
no
intention
of
trying
really
to
investigate
this
subject
but
to
deride
the
notion
that
objects
have
ever
fallen
from
the
sky
a
writer
in
the
jour
read
this
paper
and
thinks
it
remarkable
that
any
man
of
ordinary
reasoning
powers
should
write
a
paper
to
prove
that
thunderbolts
do
not
exist
i
confess
that
we
a
little
flattered
by
that
over
and
over
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
suggest
to
the
intelligent
reader
that
thunderstones
are
a
myth
we
contend
that
there
is
a
misuse
of
a
word
here
we
admit
that
only
we
are
intelligent
upon
this
subject
if
by
intelligence
is
meant
the
inquiry
of
inequilibrium
and
that
all
other
intellection
is
only
mechanical
reflex
of
course
that
intelligence
too
is
mechanical
but
less
orderly
and
confined
less
obviously
mechanical
that
as
an
acceptance
of
ours
becomes
firmer
and
we
pass
from
the
state
of
intelligence
to
reflexes
in
ruts
an
odd
thing
is
that
intelligence
is
usually
supposed
to
be
creditable
it
may
be
in
the
sense
that
it
is
mental
activity
trying
to
find
out
but
it
is
confession
of
ignorance
the
bees
the
theologians
the
dogmatic
scientists
are
the
intellectual
aristocrats
the
rest
of
us
are
plebeians
not
yet
graduated
to
nirvana
or
to
the
instinctive
and
suave
as
differentiated
from
the
intelligent
and
crude
blinkenberg
gives
many
instances
of
the
superstition
of
thunderstones
which
flourishes
only
where
mentality
is
in
a
lamentable
state
or
universally
in
malacca
sumatra
and
java
natives
say
that
stone
axes
have
often
been
found
under
trees
that
have
been
struck
by
lightning
blinkenberg
does
not
dispute
this
but
says
it
is
coincidence
that
the
axes
were
of
course
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
that
the
natives
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
these
carved
stones
had
fallen
in
or
with
lightning
in
central
africa
it
is
said
that
often
have
highly
polished
objects
of
stone
described
as
axes
been
found
sticking
in
trees
that
have
been
struck
by
lightning
or
by
what
seemed
to
be
lightning
the
natives
rather
like
the
unscientific
persons
of
memphis
when
they
saw
snakes
after
a
storm
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
axes
had
not
always
been
sticking
in
the
trees
livingstone
pages
says
that
he
had
never
heard
of
stone
implements
used
by
natives
of
africa
a
writer
in
the
of
the
smithsonian
says
that
there
are
a
few
that
they
are
said
by
the
natives
to
have
fallen
in
thunderstorms
as
to
luminosity
it
is
my
lamentable
acceptance
that
bodies
falling
through
this
earth
atmosphere
if
not
warmed
even
often
fall
with
a
brilliant
light
looking
like
flashes
of
lightning
this
matter
seems
important
we
take
it
up
later
with
data
in
prussia
two
stone
axes
were
found
in
the
trunks
of
trees
one
under
the
bark
blinkenberg
p
the
finders
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
axes
had
fallen
there
another
stone
ax
or
object
of
worked
stone
said
to
have
been
found
in
a
tree
that
had
been
struck
by
something
that
looked
like
lightning
p
the
finder
jumped
to
the
conclusion
story
told
by
blinkenberg
of
a
woman
who
lived
near
kulsbjaergene
sweden
who
found
a
flint
near
an
old
willow
near
her
house
i
emphasize
near
her
house
because
that
means
familiar
ground
the
willow
had
been
split
by
something
she
jumped
cow
killed
by
lightning
or
by
what
looked
like
lightning
isle
of
sark
near
guernsey
the
peasant
who
owned
the
cow
dug
up
the
ground
at
the
spot
and
found
a
small
greenstone
ax
blinkenberg
says
that
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
this
object
that
had
fallen
luminously
killing
the
cow
a
flint
ax
found
by
a
farmer
after
a
severe
storm
described
as
a
fearful
storm
by
a
signal
staff
which
had
been
split
by
something
i
should
say
that
nearness
to
a
signal
staff
may
be
considered
familiar
ground
whether
he
jumped
or
arrived
at
the
conclusion
by
a
more
leisurely
process
the
farmer
thought
that
the
flint
object
had
fallen
in
the
storm
in
this
instance
we
have
a
lamentable
scientist
with
us
it
impossible
to
have
positive
difference
between
orthodoxy
and
heresy
somewhere
there
must
be
a
merging
into
each
other
or
an
overlapping
nevertheless
upon
such
a
subject
as
this
it
does
seem
a
little
shocking
in
most
works
upon
meteorites
the
peculiar
sulphurous
odor
of
things
that
fall
from
the
sky
is
mentioned
sir
john
evans
says
with
extraordinary
reasoning
powers
if
he
could
never
have
thought
such
a
thing
with
ordinary
reasoning
powers
that
this
flint
object
proved
to
have
been
the
bolt
by
its
peculiar
smell
when
broken
if
it
did
so
prove
to
be
that
settles
the
whole
subject
if
we
prove
that
only
one
object
of
worked
stone
has
fallen
from
the
sky
all
piling
up
of
further
reports
is
unnecessary
however
we
have
already
taken
the
stand
that
nothing
settles
anything
that
the
disputes
of
ancient
greece
are
no
nearer
solution
now
than
they
were
several
thousand
years
ago
all
because
in
a
positive
sense
there
is
nothing
to
prove
or
solve
or
settle
our
object
is
to
be
more
nearly
real
than
our
opponents
wideness
is
an
aspect
of
the
universal
we
go
on
widely
according
to
us
the
fat
man
is
nearer
godliness
than
is
the
thin
man
eat
drink
and
approximate
to
the
positive
absolute
beware
of
negativeness
by
which
we
mean
indigestion
the
vast
majority
of
thunderstones
are
described
as
axes
but
meunier
tells
of
one
that
was
in
his
possession
said
to
have
fallen
at
ghardia
algeria
contrasting
profoundment
with
the
angular
outlines
of
ordinary
meteorites
the
conventional
explanation
that
it
had
been
formed
as
a
drop
of
molten
matter
from
a
larger
body
seems
reasonable
to
me
but
with
less
agreeableness
i
note
its
fall
in
a
thunderstorm
the
datum
that
turns
the
orthodox
meteorologist
pale
with
rage
or
induces
a
slight
elevation
of
his
eyebrows
if
you
mention
it
to
him
meunier
tells
of
another
thunderstone
said
to
have
fallen
in

africa
meunier
too
is
a
little
lamentable
here
he
quotes
a
soldier
of
experience
that
such

fall
most
frequently
in

our
acceptance
that
many
objects
and
different
substances
have
been
brought
down
by
atmospheric
disturbance
from
what
only
as
a
matter
of
convenience
now
and
until
we
have
more
data
we
call
the
sea
however
our
chief
interest
is
in
objects
that
have
been
shaped

similar

of
the

soc
of
said
to
be
of
a
kind
of
stone
unlike
any
other
found
in
burma
called
thunderbolts
by
the
natives
i
think
there
a
good
deal
of
meaning
in
such
expressions
as
unlike
any
other
found
in
burma
but
that
if
they
had
said
anything
more
definite
there
would
have
been
unpleasant
consequences
to
writers
in
the
century
more
about
the
thunderstones
of
burma
in
the
soc
antiq
of
one
of
them
described
as
an
adze
was
exhibited
by
captain
duff
who
wrote
that
there
was
no
stone
like
it
in
its
neighborhood
of
course
it
may
not
be
very
convincing
to
say
that
because
a
stone
is
unlike
neighboring
stones
it
had
foreign
origin
also
we
fear
it
is
a
kind
of
plagiarism
we
got
it
from
the
geologists
who
demonstrate
by
this
reasoning
the
foreign
origin
of
erratics
we
fear
we
a
little
gross
and
scientific
at
times
but
it
my
acceptance
that
a
great
deal
of
scientific
literature
must
be
read
between
the
lines
it
not
everyone
who
has
the
lamentableness
of
a
sir
john
evans
just
as
a
great
deal
of
voltaire
meaning
was
we
suspect
that
a
captain
duff
merely
hints
rather
than
to
risk
having
a
lawrence
smith
fly
at
him
and
call
him
a
man
whatever
captain
duff
meaning
may
have
been
and
whether
he
smiled
like
a
voltaire
when
he
wrote
it
captain
duff
writes
of
the
extremely
soft
nature
of
the
stone
rendering
it
equally
useless
as
an
offensive
or
defensive
weapon
story
by
a
correspondent
in
of
a
malay
of
considerable
social
standing
and
one
thing
about
our
data
is
that
damned
though
they
be
they
do
so
often
bring
us
into
awful
good
company
who
knew
of
a
tree
that
had
been
struck
about
a
month
before
by
something
in
a
thunderstorm
he
searched
among
the
roots
of
this
tree
and
found
a
thunderstone
not
said
whether
he
jumped
or
leaped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
had
fallen
process
likely
to
be
more
leisurely
in
tropical
countries
also
i
afraid
his
way
of
reasoning
was
not
very
original
just
so
were
fragments
of
the
meteorite
accepted
by
orthodoxy
discovered
we
shall
now
have
an
unusual
experience
we
shall
read
of
some
reports
of
extraordinary
circumstances
that
were
investigated
by
a
man
of
science
not
of
course
that
they
were
really
investigated
by
him
but
that
his
phenomena
occupied
a
position
approximating
higher
to
real
investigation
than
to
utter
neglect
over
and
over
we
read
of
extraordinary
occurrences
no
discussion
not
even
a
comment
afterward
findable
mere
mention
occasionally
burial
and
damnation
the
extraordinary
and
how
quickly
it
is
hidden
away
burial
and
damnation
or
the
obscurity
of
the
conspicuous
we
did
read
of
a
man
who
in
the
matter
of
snails
did
travel
some
distance
to
assure
himself
of
something
that
he
had
suspected
in
advance
and
we
remember
hitchcock
who
had
only
to
smite
amherst
with
the
wand
of
his
botanical
knowledge
and
lo
two
fungi
sprang
up
before
night
and
we
did
read
of
gray
and
his
thousands
of
fishes
from
one
pailful
of
water
but
these
instances
stand
out
more
frequently
there
was
no
investigation
we
now
have
a
good
many
reported
occurrences
that
were
investigated
of
things
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
we
make
in
the
usual
scientific
way
two
divisions
miscellaneous
objects
and
substances
and
symmetric
objects
attributable
to
beings
like
human
beings
into
wedges
spheres
and
disks
roy
met
that
july
a
correspondent
to
a
london
newspaper
wrote
that
something
had
fallen
from
the
sky
during
a
thunderstorm
of
june
at
netting
hill
symons
of
meteorological
investigated
about
as
fairly
and
with
about
as
unprejudiced
a
mind
as
anything
ever
has
been
investigated
he
says
that
the
object
was
nothing
but
a
lump
of
coal
that
next
door
to
the
home
of
the
correspondent
coal
had
been
unloaded
the
day
before
with
the
uncanny
wisdom
of
the
stranger
upon
unfamiliar
ground
that
we
have
noted
before
symons
saw
that
the
coal
reported
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
and
the
coal
unloaded
more
prosaically
the
day
before
were
identical
persons
in
the
neighborhood
unable
to
make
this
simple
identification
had
bought
from
the
correspondent
pieces
of
the
object
reported
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
as
to
credulity
i
know
of
no
limits
for
it
but
when
it
comes
to
paying
out
money
for
credulity
oh
no
standards
to
judge
by
of
course
just
the
same
the
trouble
with
efficiency
is
that
it
will
merge
away
into
excess
with
what
seems
to
me
to
be
of
convincingness
symons
then
lugs
another
character
into
his
little
comedy
that
it
was
all
a
hoax
by
a
chemist
pupil
who
had
filled
a
capsule
with
an
explosive
and
during
the
storm
had
thrown
the
burning
mass
into
the
gutter
so
making
an
artificial
thunderbolt
or
even
shakespeare
with
all
his
inartistry
did
not
lug
in
king
lear
to
make
hamlet
complete
whether
i
lugging
in
something
that
has
no
special
meaning
myself
or
not
i
find
that
this
storm
of
june
was
peculiar
it
is
described
in
the
london
july
that
during
the
storm
the
sky
in
many
places
remained
partially
clear
while
hail
and
rain
were
falling
that
may
have
more
meaning
when
we
take
up
the
possible
origin
of
some
hailstones
especially
if
they
fall
from
a
cloudless
sky
mere
suggestion
not
worth
much
that
there
may
have
been
falls
of
substances
in
london
june
clinkers
said
to
have
fallen
during
a
storm
at
kilburn
july
according
to
the
july
quoted
by
symons
a
street
had
been
literally
strewn
during
the
storm
with
a
mass
of
clinkers
estimated
at
about
two
bushels
sizes
from
that
of
a
walnut
to
that
of
a
man
hand
pieces
of
the
clinkers
can
be
seen
at
the
office
if
these
clinkers
or
cinders
were
refuse
from
one
of
the
constructions
from
which
coke
and
coal
and
ashes
occasionally
fall
to
this
earth
or
rather
to
the
sea
from
which
dislodgment
by
tempests
occurs
it
is
intermediatistic
to
accept
that
they
must
merge
away
somewhere
with
local
phenomena
of
the
scene
of
precipitation
if
a
stove
should
drop
from
a
cloud
into
broadway
someone
would
find
that
at
about
the
time
of
the
occurrence
a
moving
van
had
passed
and
that
the
moving
men
had
tired
of
the
stove
or
something
that
it
had
not
been
really
but
had
been
rouged
instead
of
blacked
by
some
housekeeper
compared
with
some
of
the
scientific
explanations
that
we
have
encountered
considerable
restraint
i
think
in
that
one
symons
learned
that
in
the
same
street
he
emphasizes
that
it
was
a
short
street
there
was
a
station
i
had
such
an
impression
of
him
hustling
and
bustling
around
at
notting
hill
searching
cellars
until
he
found
one
with
newly
arrived
coal
in
it
ringing
door
bells
exciting
a
whole
neighborhood
calling
up
to
windows
stopping
people
in
the
streets
hotter
and
hotter
on
the
trail
of
a
wretched
imposter
of
a
chemist
pupil
after
his
efficiency
at
notting
hill
we
expect
to
hear
that
he
went
to
the
station
and
something
like
this
it
is
said
that
clinkers
fell
in
your
street
at
about
ten
minutes
past
four
afternoon
of
july
fifth
will
you
look
over
your
records
and
tell
me
where
your
engine
was
at
about
ten
minutes
past
four
july
fifth
symons
says
i
think
that
most
probably
they
had
been
raked
out
of
the
steam
june
it
was
reported
that
a
thunderstone
had
struck
the
house
at
oakley
street
chelsea
falling
down
the
chimney
into
the
kitchen
grate
symons
investigated
he
describes
the
thunderstone
as
an
agglomeration
of
brick
soot
unburned
coal
and
cinder
he
says
that
in
his
opinion
lightning
had
flashed
down
the
chimney
and
had
fused
some
of
the
brick
of
it
he
does
think
it
remarkable
that
the
lightning
did
not
then
scatter
the
contents
of
the
grate
which
were
disturbed
only
as
if
a
heavy
body
had
fallen
if
we
admit
that
climbing
up
the
chimney
to
find
out
is
too
rigorous
a
requirement
for
a
man
who
may
have
been
large
dignified
and
subject
to
expansions
the
only
unreasonableness
we
find
in
what
he
says
as
judged
by
our
more
modern
outlook
is
i
suppose
that
no
one
would
suggest
that
bricks
are
manufactured
in
the
atmosphere
sounds
a
little
unreasonable
to
us
because
it
is
so
of
the
positivistic
spirit
of
former
times
when
it
was
not
so
obvious
that
the
highest
incredibility
and
laughability
must
merge
away
with
the
proper
as
the
am
would
say
the
preposterous
is
always
interpretable
in
terms
of
the
proper
with
which
it
must
be
continuous
or
masses
such
as
have
fallen
from
the
sky
tremendous
heat
generated
by
their
velocity
they
bake
bricks
we
begin
to
suspect
that
symons
exhausted
himself
at
notting
hill
it
a
warning
to
then
the
instance
of
three
lumps
of
earthy
matter
found
upon
a
path
after
a
thunderstorm
at
reading
july
there
are
so
many
records
of
the
fall
of
earthy
matter
from
the
sky
that
it
would
seem
almost
uncanny
to
find
resistance
here
were
we
not
so
accustomed
to
the
uncompromising
stands
of
orthodoxy
which
in
our
metaphysics
represent
good
as
attempts
but
evil
in
their
insufficiency
if
i
thought
it
necessary
i
list
one
hundred
and
fifty
instances
of
earthy
matter
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
it
is
his
antagonism
to
atmospheric
disturbance
associated
with
the
fall
of
things
from
the
sky
that
blinds
and
hypnotizes
a
symons
here
this
especial
symons
rejects
the
reading
substance
because
it
was
not
of
true
meteoritic
material
it
uncanny
or
it
not
uncanny
at
all
but
universal
if
you
do
take
something
for
a
standard
of
opinion
you
ca
have
any
opinion
at
all
but
if
you
do
take
a
standard
in
some
of
its
applications
it
must
be
preposterous
the
carbonaceous
meteorites
which
are
unquestioned
though
avoided
as
we
have
seen
by
orthodoxy
are
more
glaringly
of
untrue
meteoritic
material
than
was
this
substance
of
reading
symons
says
that
these
three
lumps
were
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
whether
these
data
are
worth
preserving
or
not
i
think
that
the
appeal
that
this
especial
symons
makes
is
worthy
of
a
place
in
the
museum
we
writing
he
argues
against
belief
in
all
external
origins
for
our
credit
as
englishmen
he
is
a
patriot
but
i
think
that
these
foreigners
had
a
small
chance
in
the
first
place
for
hospitality
from
him
then
comes
a
small
lump
of
iron
two
inches
in
diameter
said
to
have
fallen
during
a
thunderstorm
at
brixton
symons
says
at
present
i
can
not
trace
it
he
was
at
his
best
at
notting
hill
there
been
a
marked
falling
off
in
his
later
manner
in
the
london
it
is
said
that
a
roundish
object
of
iron
had
been
found
after
a
violent
thunderstorm
in
a
garden
at
brixton
it
was
analyzed
by
a
chemist
who
could
not
identify
it
as
true
meteoritic
material
whether
a
product
of
workmanship
like
human
workmanship
or
not
this
object
is
described
as
an
oblate
spheroid
about
two
inches
across
its
major
diameter
the
chemist
name
and
address
are
given
james
morgan
ebbw
vale
garden
familiar
ground
i
suppose
that
in
symons
opinion
this
symmetric
object
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
though
he
neglects
to
say
this
but
we
do
note
that
he
described
this
object
as
a
lump
which
does
not
suggest
the
spheroidal
or
symmetric
it
is
our
notion
that
the
word
lump
was
because
of
its
meaning
of
amorphousness
used
purposely
to
have
the
next
datum
stand
alone
remote
without
similars
if
symons
had
said
that
there
had
been
a
report
of
another
round
object
that
had
fallen
from
the
sky
his
readers
would
be
attracted
by
an
agreement
he
distracts
his
readers
by
describing
in
terms
of
the
unprecedented
iron
cannon
ball
it
was
found
in
a
manure
heap
in
sussex
after
a
thunderstorm
however
symons
argues
pretty
reasonably
it
seems
to
me
that
given
a
cannon
ball
in
a
manure
heap
in
the
first
place
lightning
might
be
attracted
by
it
and
if
seen
to
strike
there
the
untutored
mind
or
mentality
below
the
average
would
leap
or
jump
or
proceed
with
less
celerity
to
the
conclusion
that
the
iron
object
had
fallen
except
that
if
every
farmer
is
upon
very
familiar
ground
or
if
every
farmer
does
know
his
own
manure
heap
as
well
as
symons
knew
his
writing
desk
then
comes
the
instance
of
a
man
his
wife
and
his
three
daughters
at
casterton
westmoreland
who
were
looking
out
at
their
lawn
during
a
thunderstorm
when
they
considered
as
symons
expresses
it
that
they
saw
a
stone
fall
from
the
sky
kill
a
sheep
and
bury
itself
in
the
ground
they
dug
they
found
a
stone
ball
symons
coincidence
it
had
been
there
in
the
first
place
this
object
was
exhibited
at
a
meeting
of
the
royal
meteorological
society
by
it
is
described
in
the
list
of
exhibits
as
a
sandstone
ball
it
is
described
as
sandstone
by
symons
now
a
round
piece
of
sandstone
may
be
almost
anywhere
in
the
ground
in
the
first
place
but
by
our
more
or
less
discreditable
habit
of
prying
and
snooping
we
find
that
this
object
was
rather
more
complex
and
of
material
less
commonplace
in
snooping
through
we
read
that
this
thunderstone
was
in
the
possession
of
who
tells
the
story
of
the
witness
and
his
family
the
sheep
killed
the
burial
of
something
in
the
earth
the
digging
and
the
finding
describes
the
object
as
a
ball
of
hard
ferruginous
quartzite
about
the
size
of
a
cocoanut
weight
about
twelve
pounds
whether
we
feeling
around
for
significance
or
not
there
is
a
suggestion
not
only
of
symmetry
but
of
structure
in
this
object
it
had
an
external
shell
separated
from
a
loose
nucleus
attributes
this
cleavage
to
unequal
cooling
of
the
mass
my
own
notion
is
that
there
is
very
little
deliberate
misrepresentation
in
the
writings
of
scientific
men
that
they
are
quite
as
guiltless
in
intent
as
are
other
hypnotic
subjects
such
a
victim
of
induced
belief
reads
of
a
stone
ball
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
mechanically
in
his
mind
arise
impressions
of
globular
lumps
or
nodules
of
sandstone
which
are
common
almost
everywhere
he
assimilates
the
reported
fall
with
his
impressions
of
objects
in
the
ground
in
the
first
place
to
an
intermediatist
the
phenomena
of
intellection
are
only
phenomena
of
universal
process
localized
in
human
minds
the
process
called
explanation
is
only
a
local
aspect
of
universal
assimilation
it
looks
like
materialism
but
the
intermediatist
holds
that
interpretation
of
the
immaterial
as
it
is
called
in
terms
of
the
material
as
it
is
called
is
no
more
rational
than
interpretation
of
the
material
in
terms
of
the
immaterial
that
there
is
in
neither
the
material
nor
the
immaterial
but
approximations
one
way
or
the
other
but
so
hypnotic
that
globular
lumps
of
sandstone
are
common
whether
he
jumps
or
leaps
or
whether
only
the
frowsy
and
are
so
athletic
his
is
the
impression
by
assimilation
that
this
especial
object
is
a
ball
of
sandstone
or
human
mentality
its
inhabitants
are
conveniences
it
may
be
that
symons
paper
was
written
before
this
object
was
exhibited
to
the
members
of
the
society
and
with
the
charity
with
which
for
the
sake
of
diversity
we
intersperse
our
malices
we
are
willing
to
accept
that
he
investigated
something
that
he
had
never
seen
but
whoever
listed
this
object
was
uncareful
it
is
listed
as
sandstone
we
making
excuses
for
them
really
as
it
were
you
know
we
not
quite
so
damned
as
we
were
one
does
not
apologize
for
the
gods
and
at
the
same
time
feel
quite
utterly
prostrate
before
them
if
this
were
a
real
existence
and
all
of
us
real
persons
with
real
standards
to
judge
by
i
afraid
we
have
to
be
a
little
severe
with
some
of
these
symonses
as
it
is
of
course
seriousness
seems
out
of
place
we
note
an
amusing
little
touch
in
the
indefinite
allusion
to
a
man
who
with
his
family
had
considered
that
he
had
seen
a
stone
fall
the
man
was
the
rev
who
was
in
his
day
the
next
instance
was
reported
by
tripp
that
during
a
thunderstorm
a
farmer
had
seen
the
ground
in
front
of
him
plowed
up
by
something
that
was
luminous
dug
bronze
ax
my
own
notion
is
that
an
expedition
to
the
north
pole
could
not
be
so
urgent
as
that
representative
scientists
should
have
gone
to
that
farmer
and
there
spent
a
summer
studying
this
one
reported
occurrence
as
it
is
farmer
somewhere
no
date
the
thing
must
stay
damned
another
specimen
for
our
museum
is
a
comment
in
upon
these
objects
that
they
are
of
an
amusing
character
thus
clearly
showing
that
they
were
of
terrestrial
and
not
a
celestial
character
just
why
celestiality
or
that
of
it
which
too
is
only
of
intermediateness
should
not
be
quite
as
amusing
as
terrestriality
is
beyond
our
reasoning
powers
which
we
have
agreed
are
not
ordinary
of
course
there
is
nothing
amusing
about
wedges
and
spheres
at
all
or
archimedes
and
euclid
are
humorists
it
is
that
they
were
described
derisively
if
you
like
a
little
specimen
of
the
standardization
of
orthodox
opinion
met
they
are
of
an
amusing
character
thus
clearly
showing
that
they
were
of
a
terrestrial
and
not
a
celestial
character
i
sure
not
positively
of
course
that
we
tried
to
be
as
easygoing
and
lenient
with
symons
as
his
obviously
scientific
performance
would
permit
of
course
it
may
be
that
we
were
prejudiced
against
him
instinctively
classing
him
with
augustine
darwin
jerome
and
lyell
as
to
the
thunderstones
i
think
that
he
investigated
them
mostly
for
the
credit
of
englishmen
or
in
the
spirit
of
the
royal
krakatoa
committee
or
about
as
the
commission
from
the
french
academy
investigated
meteorites
according
to
a
writer
in
the
krakatoa
committee
attempted
not
in
the
least
to
prove
what
had
caused
the
atmospheric
effects
of
but
to
prove
that
krakatoa
did
it
altogether
i
should
think
that
the
following
quotation
should
be
enlightening
to
anyone
who
still
thinks
that
these
occurrences
were
investigated
not
to
support
an
opinion
formed
in
advance
in
opening
his
paper
symons
says
that
he
undertook
his
investigation
as
to
the
existence
of
thunderstones
or
thunderbolts
as
he
calls
them
feeling
certain
that
there
was
a
weak
point
somewhere
inasmuch
as
have
no
existence
we
have
another
instance
of
the
reported
fall
of
a
cannon
ball
it
occurred
prior
to
symons
investigations
but
is
not
mentioned
by
him
it
was
investigated
however
in
the
roy
soc
is
the
report
of
a
thunderstone
supposed
to
have
fallen
in
hampshire
it
was
an
iron
cannon
ball
or
it
was
a
large
nodule
of
iron
pyrites
or
bisulphuret
of
iron
no
one
had
seen
it
fall
it
had
been
noticed
upon
a
garden
path
for
the
first
time
after
a
thunderstorm
it
was
only
a
supposed
thing
because
it
had
not
the
character
of
any
known
meteorite
in
the
london
appears
a
letter
from
george
bailey
a
chemist
of
andover
hants
he
says
that
in
a
very
heavy
thunderstorm
of
the
first
week
of
september
this
iron
object
had
fallen
in
the
garden
of
robert
dowling
of
andover
that
it
had
fallen
upon
a
path
within
six
yards
of
the
house
it
had
been
picked
up
immediately
after
the
storm
by
dowling
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
cricket
ball
weight
four
pounds
no
one
had
seen
it
fall
in
the
there
is
an
account
of
this
thunderstorm
which
was
of
unusual
violence
there
are
some
other
data
relative
to
the
ball
of
quartz
of
westmoreland
they
poor
things
there
so
little
to
them
that
they
look
like
ghosts
of
the
damned
however
ghosts
when
multiplied
take
on
what
is
called
substantiality
if
the
solidest
thing
conceivable
in
is
only
concentrated
phantomosity
it
is
not
only
that
there
have
been
other
reports
of
quartz
that
has
fallen
from
the
sky
there
is
another
agreement
the
round
quartz
object
of
westmoreland
if
broken
open
and
separated
from
its
loose
nucleus
would
be
a
round
hollow
quartz
object
my
is
that
two
reports
of
similar
extraordinary
occurrences
one
from
england
and
one
from
canada
are
interesting
canadian
that
at
the
meeting
of
the
institute
of
one
of
the
members
livingstone
exhibited
a
globular
quartz
body
which
he
asserted
had
fallen
from
the
sky
it
had
been
split
open
it
was
hollow
but
the
other
members
of
the
institute
decided
that
the
object
was
spurious
because
it
was
not
of
true
meteoritic
material
no
date
no
place
mentioned
we
note
the
suggestion
that
it
was
only
a
geode
which
had
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
its
crystalline
lining
was
quartz
is
upon
the
index
prohibitory
of
science
a
monk
who
would
read
darwin
would
sin
no
more
than
would
a
scientist
who
would
admit
that
except
by
the
up
and
down
process
quartz
has
ever
fallen
from
the
sky
but
continuity
it
is
not
excommunicated
if
part
of
or
incorporated
in
a
baptized
meteorite
catherine
of
mexico

think
it
as
epicurean
a
distinction
as
any
ever
made
by
theologians
fassig

a
quartz
pebble
found
in
a
hailstone
part
up
and
down
of

another
object
of
quartzite
was
reported
to
have
fallen
in
the
autumn
of
at
schroon
lake
said
in
the
to
be
a
fraud
it
was
not
the
usual
about
the
first
of
may
the
newspapers
published
a
story
of
a
meteorite
that
had
fallen
at
vincennes
indiana
the
editor
of
the
weather
issue
of
april
requested
the
local
observer
at
vincennes
to
investigate
the
editor
says
that
the
thing
was
only
a
fragment
of
a
quartz
boulder
he
says
that
anyone
with
at
least
a
public
school
education
should
know
better
than
to
write
that
quartz
has
ever
fallen
from
the
sky
and
that
in
the
leyden
museum
of
antiquities
there
is
a
disk
of
quartz
centimeters
by
millimeters
by
about
centimeters
said
to
have
fallen
upon
a
plantation
in

dutch
west
indies

meteoric
explosion
bricks
i
think
this
is
a
vice
we
writing
i
recommend
it
to
those
who
have
hankered
for
a
new
sin
at
first
some
of
our
data
were
of
so
frightful
or
ridiculous
mien
as
to
be
hated
or
eyebrowed
was
only
to
be
seen
then
some
pity
crept
in
i
think
that
we
can
now
embrace
bricks
the
was
all
right
in
its
place
but
it
rather
lacks
distinction
i
think
with
our
minds
upon
the
concrete
boats
that
have
been
building
terrestrially
lately
and
thinking
of
wrecks
that
may
occur
to
some
of
them
and
of
a
new
material
for
the
fishes
to
disregard

that
fell

to
have

august
new
phil
the

offered
an
explanation
that
started
another
convention
that
the
fragments
of

had
been
knocked
from

by
the

but
there
is
here
a
concomitant
that
will
be
disagreeable
to
anyone
who
may
have
been
inclined
to
smile
at
the
now
digestible
enough
notion
that
bricks
have
fallen
from
the
sky
it
is
that
in
some
of
the
hailstones
two
per
cent
of
them
that
were
found
with
the
pieces
of
brick
was
a
light
grayish
powder

astronomical
padre
sechi
explains
that
a
stone
said
to
have
fallen
in
a
thunderstorm
at
supino
italy
september
had
been
knocked
from
a
roof
that
it
had
been
reported
that
a
stone
of
form
clearly
artificial
had
fallen
at
naples
november
the
stone
was
described
by
two
professors
of
naples
who
had
accepted
it
as
inexplicable
but
veritable
they
were
visited
by
the
correspondent
to
whose
investigations
had
convinced
him
that
the
object
was
a
shoemaker
lapstone
now
to
us
of
the
initiated
or
to
us
of
the
wider
outlook
there
is
nothing
incredible
in
the
thought
of
shoemakers
in
other
worlds
but
i
suspect
that
this
characterization
is
tactical
this
object
of
worked
stone
or
this
shoemaker
lapstone
was
made
of
vesuvian
lava
thinks
most
probably
of
lava
of
the
flow
of
from
the
la
scala
quarries
we
condemn
most
probably
as
bad
positivism
as
to
the
men
of
position
who
had
accepted
that
this
thing
had
fallen
from
the
sky
i
have
now
obliged
them
to
admit
their
mistake
says
or
it
always
the
stranger
in
naples
who
knows
la
scala
lava
better
than
the
natives
know
it
explanation
that
the
thing
had
been
knocked
from
or
thrown
from
a
roof
as
to
attempt
to
trace
the
occurrence
to
any
special
roof
nothing
said
upon
that
subject
or
that
called
a
carved
stone
a
lapstone
quite
as
symons
called
a
spherical
object
a
cannon
ball
bent
upon
a
discrediting
incongruity
shoemaking
and
celestiality
it
is
so
easy
to
say
that
axes
or
stones
found
on
the
ground
were
there
in
the
first
place
and
that
it
is
only
coincidence
that
lightning
should
strike
near
one
but
the
credibility
of
coincidences
decreases
as
the
square
root
of
their
volume
i
think
our
massed
instances
speak
too
much
of
coincidences
of
coincidences
but
the
axes
or
objects
that
have
been
found
in
trees
are
more
difficult
for
orthodoxy
for
instance
arago
accepts
that
such
finds
have
occurred
but
he
argues
that
if
stones
have
been
found
in
tree
trunks
so
have
toads
been
found
in
tree
trunks
did
the
toads
fall
there
not
at
all
bad
for
a
hypnotic
of
course
in
our
acceptance
the
irish
are
the
chosen
people
because
they
are
characteristically
best
in
accord
with
the
underlying
essence
of
arago
answers
a
question
by
asking
another
question
that
the
only
way
a
question
can
be
answered
in
our
hibernian
kind
of
an
existence
bodding
argued
with
the
natives
of
the
santal
parganas
india
who
said
that
cut
and
shaped
stones
had
fallen
from
the
sky
some
of
them
lodging
in
tree
trunks
bodding
with
orthodox
notions
of
velocity
of
falling
bodies
having
missed
i
suppose
some
of
the
notes
i
have
upon
large
hailstones
which
for
size
have
fallen
with
astonishingly
low
velocity
argued
that
anything
falling
from
the
sky
would
be
smashed
to
atoms
he
accepts
that
objects
of
worked
stone
have
been
found
in
tree
trunks
but
he
explains
that
the
santals
often
steal
trees
but
do
not
chop
them
down
in
the
usual
way
because
that
would
be
to
make
too
much
noise
they
insert
stone
wedges
and
hammer
them
instead
then
if
they
should
be
caught
wedges
would
not
be
the
evidence
against
them
that
axes
would
be
or
that
a
scientific
man
ca
be
desperate
and
reasonable
too
or
that
a
pickpocket
for
instance
is
safe
though
caught
with
his
hand
in
one
pocket
if
he
gloved
say
because
no
court
in
the
land
would
regard
a
gloved
hand
in
the
same
way
in
which
a
bare
hand
would
be
regarded
that
there
nothing
but
intermediateness
to
the
rational
and
the
preposterous
that
this
status
of
our
own
ratiocinations
is
perceptible
wherein
they
are
upon
the
unfamiliar
bodding
collected
of
these
shaped
stones
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
in
the
course
of
many
years
he
says
that
the
santals
are
a
highly
developed
race
and
for
ages
have
not
used
stone
implements
except
in
this
one
nefarious
convenience
to
him
all
explanations
are
localizations
they
fade
away
before
the
universal
it
is
difficult
to
express
that
black
rains
in
england
do
not
originate
in
the
smoke
of
factories
less
difficult
to
express
that
black
rains
of
south
africa
do
not
we
utter
little
stress
upon
the
absurdity
of
bedding
explanation
because
if
anything
absurd
absurd
or
rather
has
in
it
some
degree
or
aspect
of
absurdity
and
we
never
had
experience
with
any
state
except
something
somewhere
between
ultimate
absurdity
and
final
reasonableness
our
acceptance
is
that
bedding
elaborate
explanation
does
not
apply
to
objects
found
in
tree
trunks
in
other
lands
we
accept
that
for
the
general
a
local
explanation
is
inadequate
as
to
thunderstones
not
said
to
have
fallen
luminously
and
not
said
to
have
been
found
sticking
in
trees
we
are
told
by
faithful
hypnotics
that
astonished
rustics
come
upon
prehistoric
axes
that
have
been
washed
into
sight
by
rains
and
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
the
things
have
fallen
from
the
sky
but
simple
rustics
come
upon
many
prehistoric
things
scrapers
pottery
knives
hammers
we
have
no
record
of
rusticity
coming
upon
old
pottery
after
a
rain
reporting
the
fall
of
a
bowl
from
the
sky
just
now
my
own
acceptance
is
that
stone
objects
formed
by
means
similar
to
human
workmanship
have
often
fallen
from
the
sky
maybe
there
are
messages
upon
them
my
acceptance
is
that
they
have
been
called
axes
to
discredit
them
or
the
more
familiar
a
term
the
higher
the
incongruity
with
vague
concepts
of
the
vast
remote
tremendous
unknown
in
and
a
writer
says
that
he
had
a
thunderstone
which
he
had
brought
from
jamaica
the
description
is
of

objects
said
by
the

to
have
fallen
from

are
alluded
to
throughout
as
wedges
in
the
in
a
paper
upon
the
thunderstones
of
java
the
objects
are
called
wedges
and
not
axes
our
notion
is
that
rustics
and
savages
call
objects
that
fall
from
the
sky
axes
that
scientific
men
when
it
suits
their
purposes
can
resist
temptations
to
prolixity
and
pedantry
and
adopt
the
simple
that
they
can
be
intelligible
when
derisive
all
of
which
lands
us
in
a
confusion
worse
i
think
than
we
were
in
before
we
so
satisfactorily
emerged
from
the
distresses
of
butter
and
blood
and
ink
and
paper
and
punk
and
silk
now
it
cannon
balls
and

and
disks
if
a
lapstone
be
a

it
a
flat
stone
at
any
rate
a
great
many
scientists
are
good
impressionists
they
snub
the
impertinences
of
details
had
he
been
of
a
coarse
grubbing
nature
i
think
bodding
could
never
have
so
simply
and
beautifully
explained
the
occurrence
of
stone
wedges
in
tree
trunks
but
to
a
realist
the
story
would
be
something
like
this
a
man
who
needed
a
tree
in
a
land
of
jungles
where
for
some
unknown
reason
everyone
very
selfish
with
his
trees
conceives
that
hammering
stone
wedges
makes
less
noise
than
does
the
chopping
of
wood
he
and
his
descendants
in
a
course
of
many
years
cut
down
trees
with
wedges
and
escape
penalty
because
it
never
occurs
to
a
prosecutor
that
the
head
of
an
ax
is
a
wedge
the
story
is
like
every
other
attempted
positivism
beautiful
and
complete
until
we
see
what
it
excludes
or
disregards
whereupon
it
becomes
the
ugly
and
incomplete
but
not
absolutely
because
there
is
probably
something
of
what
is
called
foundation
for
it
perhaps
a
mentally
incomplete
santal
did
once
do
something
of
the
kind
story
told
to
bodding
in
the
usual
scientific
way
he
makes
a
dogma
of
an
aberration
or
we
did
have
to
utter
a
little
stress
upon
this
matter
after
all
they
so
hairy
and
attractive
these
scientists
of
the
century
we
feel
the
zeal
of
a
sitting
bull
when
we
think
of
their
scalps
we
shall
have
to
have
an
expression
of
our
own
upon
this
confusing
subject
we
have
expressions
we
do
call
them
explanations
we
discarded
explanations
with
beliefs
though
everyone
who
scalps
is
in
the
oneness
of
allness
himself
likely
to
be
scalped
there
is
such
a
discourtesy
to
an
enemy
as
the
wearing
of
wigs
cannon
balls
and
wedges
and
what
may
they
mean
bombardments
of
this
earth
attempts
to
communicate
or

from
the

a

a
cargo
of
such
things
held
for
ages
in
suspension
in
the
sea
falling
or
shaken
down
occasionally
by
storms
but
by
preponderance
of
description
we
can
not
accept
that
thunderstones
ever
were
attached
to
handles
or
are
prehistoric
axes
as
to
attempts
to
communicate
with
this
earth
by
means
of
objects
especially
adapted
to
the
penetration
of
vast
gelatinous
areas
spread
around
this
earth
in
the
roy
irish
there
is
an
account
of
a
stone
wedge
that
fell
from
the
sky
near
cashel
tipperary
the
phenomenon
is
not
questioned
but
the
orthodox
preference
is
to
call
it
not
nor
but
pyramidal
for
data
of
other
pyramidal
stones
said
to
have
fallen
from

haughton
says
in

a
singular
feature
is
observable
in
this

that
i
have
never
seen
in
any
other
the
rounded
edges
of
the

are

on

perfect
as
if
made
by

idea
is
that
the
marks
may
have
been
made
by
some
peculiar
tension
in
the
cooling
it
must
have
been
very
peculiar
if
in
all
aerolites
not
no
such
phenomenon
had
ever
been
observed
it
merges
away
with
one
or
two
instances
known
after
haughton
time
of
seeming
stratification
in
meteorites
stratification
in
meteorites
however
is
denied
by
the
faithful
i
begin
to
suspect
something
else
a
whopper
is
coming
later
it
will
be
as
reasonable
by
familiarity
as
anything
else
ever
said
if
someone
should
study
the
stone
of
cashel
as
champollion
studied
the
rosetta
stone
he
might
or
rather
would
inevitably
find
meaning
in
those
lines
and
translate
them
into
english
nevertheless
i
begin
to
suspect
something
else
something
more
subtle
and
esoteric
than
graven
characters
upon
stones
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
in
attempts
to
communicate
the
notion
that
other
worlds
are
attempting
to
communicate
with
this
world
is
widespread
my
own
notion
is
that
it
is
not
attempt
at
all
that
it
was
achievement
centuries
ago
i
should
like
to
send
out
a
report
that
a
thunderstone
had
fallen
say
somewhere
in
new
hampshire
and
keep
track
of
every
person
who
came
to
examine
that
stone
trace
down
his
affiliations
keep
track
of
him
then
send
out
a
report
that
a
thunderstone
had
fallen
at
stockholm
say
would
one
of
the
persons
who
had
gone
to
new
hampshire
be
met
again
in
stockholm
but
what
if
he
had
no
anthropological
lapidarian
or
meteorological
affiliations
but
did
belong
to
a
secret
society
it
is
only
a
dawning
credulity
of
the
three
forms
of
symmetric
objects
that
have
or
have
fallen
from
the
sky
it
seems
to
me
that
the
disk
is
the
most
striking
so
far
in
this
respect
we
have
been
at
our
worst
possibly
that
pretty
bad
but
lapstones
are
likely
to
be
of
considerable
variety
of
form
and
something
that
is
said
to
have
fallen
at
sometime
somewhere
in
the
dutch
west
indies
is
profoundly
of
the
unchosen
now
we
shall
have
something
that
is
high
up
in
the
castes
of
the
accursed
that
upon
june
in
a
violent
storm
two
months
before
the
reported
fall
of
the
symmetric
iron
object
of
brixton
a
small
stone
had
fallen
from
the
sky
at

in

millimeters
thick

reported
to
the
french

tarbes
this
time
the
old
convenience
there
in
the
first
place
is
too
greatly
resisted
the
stone
was
covered
with
ice
this
object
had
been
cut
and
shaped
by
means
similar
to
human
hands
and
human
mentality
it
was
a

not

anywhere
nothing
of

that
fell
at

in

the
thing
had
fallen
alone
but
as
mechanically
as
any
part
of
a
machine
responds
to
its
stimulus
the
explanation
appears
in
that
this
stone
had
been
raised
by
a
whirlwind
and
then
flung
down
it
may
be
that
in
the
whole
nineteenth

no
event
more
important
than
this
occurred
in

my
own
that
we
been
damned
by
giants
sound
asleep

by
great
scientific
principles
and
abstractions
that
can
not
realize
themselves
that
little
harlots
have
visited
their
caprices
upon
us
that
clowns
with
buckets
of
water
from
which
they
pretend
to
cast
thousands
of

have
anathematized
us
for
laughing
disrespectfully

as
with
all

underlying
buffoonery
is
the
desire
to
be
taken
seriously

pale
ignorances
presiding

which
they

not
distinguish
flesh
from

the

if

nearly
real
we
are
reasons
arraigned
before
a
jury
of
of

in

very
few
were
seen
to
fall
it
is
considered
sufficient
grounds
for
admission
if
specimens
ca
be
accounted
for
in
any
way
other
than
that
they
fell
from
the
sky
as
if
in
the
haze
of
uncertainty
that
surrounds
all
things

that
is
the
essence
of
everything

in
the
merging
away
of
everything
into

there
could
be
anything
that
could
be
accounted

way
the
scientist

reason
that
if
something
can
be
accounted

it
is
accounted

would
be

if
the
conditions
that
it
imposes
but
of
course
does
not
insist
upon
could
anywhere
be
found
in
in
our
acceptance
logic
science
art
religion
are
in
our
existence
premonitions
of
a
coming
awakening
like
dawning
awarenesses
of
surroundings
in
the
mind
of
a
dreamer
any
old
chunk
of
metal
that
measures
up
to
the
standard
of
true
meteoritic
material
is
admitted
by
the
museums
it
may
seem
incredible
that
modern
curators
still
have
this
delusion
but
we
suspect
that
the
date
on
one
morning
newspaper
has
much
to
do
with
one
modernity
all
day
long
in
reading
fletcher
catalogue
for
instance
we
learn
that
some
of
the
meteorites
were
found
in
draining
a
field
found
in
making
a
road
turned
up
by
the
plow
occurs
a
dozen
times
someone
fishing
in
lake
okeechobee
brought
up
an
object
in
his
fishing
net
no
meteorite
had
ever
been
seen
to
fall
near
it
the
national
museum
accepts
it
if
we
have
accepted
only
one
of
the
data
of
untrue
meteoritic
material
one
instance
of
carbonaceous
matter
if
it
be
too
difficult
to
utter
the
word
coal
we
see
that
in
this
as
in
every
other
means
of
forming
an
opinion
false
inclusion
and
false
exclusion
have
been
practiced
by
curators
of
museums
there
is
something
of
of
cosmic
sadness
in
this
universal
search
for
a
standard
and
in
belief
that
one
has
been
revealed
by
either
inspiration
or
analysis
then
the
dogged
clinging
to
a
poor
sham
of
a
thing
long
after
its
insufficiency
has
been
shown
or
renewed
hope
and
search
for
the
special
that
can
be
true
or
for
something
local
that
could
also
be
universal
it
as
if
true
meteoritic
material
were
a
rock
of
ages
to
some
scientific
men
they
cling
but
clingers
can
not
hold
out
welcoming
arms
the
only
seemingly
conclusive
utterance
or
seemingly
substantial
thing
to
cling
to
is
a
product
of
dishonesty
ignorance
or
fatigue
all
sciences
go
back
and
back
until
they
worn
out
with
the
process
or
until
mechanical
reaction
occurs
then
they
move
forward
as
it
were
then
they
become
dogmatic
and
take
for
bases
positions
that
were
only
points
of
exhaustion
so
chemistry
divided
and
down
to
atoms
then
in
the
essential
insecurity
of
all
it
built
up
a
system
which
to
anyone
so
obsessed
by
his
own
hypnoses
that
he
is
exempt
to
the
chemist
hypnoses
is
perceptibly
enough
an
intellectual
an√¶mia
built
upon
infinitesimal
debilities
in

history
asserts
or
confesses
that
often
have
objects
of
material
such

he
says
that

have

accompanied
by
assurances
that
they
have
been
seen
to
fall
on
lawns
on
roads
in

of
houses
they
are
all
excluded
they
are
not
of
true
meteoritic
material
they
were
on
the
ground
in
the
first
place
it
is
only
by
coincidence
that
lightning
has
struck
or
that
a
real
meteorite
which
was
unfindable
has
struck
near
objects
of
slag
and
limestone

says
that
the
list
might
be
extended
indefinitely
that
a
tantalizing
suggestion
of
some
very
interesting
stuff
he
says
but
it
is
not
worth
while
i
like
to
know
what
strange
damned
excommunicated
things
have
been
sent
to
museums
by
persons
who
have
felt
convinced
that
they
had
seen
what
they
may
have
seen
strongly
enough
to
risk
ridicule
to
make
up
bundles
go
to
express
offices
and
write
letters
i
accept
that
over
the
door
of
every
museum
into
which
such
things
enter
is
written
abandon
hope
if
a
symons
mentions
one
instance
of
coal
or
of
slag
or
cinders
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
we
are
not
except
by
association
with
the
carbonaceous
meteorites
strong
in
our
impression
that
coal
sometimes
falls
to
this
earth
from
up
somewhere
in
daubr√©e
tells
the
same
story
our
acceptance
then
is
that
other
curators
could
tell
this
same
story
then
the
phantomosity
of
our
impression
substantiates
proportionately
to
its
multiplicity
daubr√©e
says
that
often
have
strange
damned
things
been
sent
to
the
french
museums
accompanied
by
assurances
that
they
had
been
seen
to
fall
from
the
sky
especially
to
our
interest
he
mentions
coal
and
slag
excluded
buried
and
undated
in
science
potter
field
i
do
not
say
that
the
data
of
the
damned
should
have
the
same
rights
as
the
data
of
the
saved
that
would
be
justice
that
would
be
of
the
positive
absolute
and
though
the
ideal
of
a
violation
of
the
very
essence
of
wherein
only
to
have
the
appearance
of
being
is
to
express
a
preponderance
of
force
one
way
or
another
or
inequilibrium
or
inconsistency
or
injustice
our
acceptance
is
that
the
passing
away
of
exclusionism
is
a
phenomenon
of
the
twentieth
century
that
gods
of
the
twentieth
century
will
sustain
our
notions
be
they
ever
so
unwashed
and
frowsy
but
in
our
own
expressions
we
are
limited
by
the
oneness
of
quasiness
to
the
very
same
methods
by
which
orthodoxy
established
and
maintains
its
now
sleek
suave
preposterousnesses
at
any
rate
though
we
are
inspired
by
an
especial
subtle
essence
or
imponderable
i
think
that
pervades
the
twentieth
century
we
have
not
the
superstition
that
we
are
offering
anything
as
a
positive
fact
rather
often
we
have
not
the
delusion
that
we
any
less
superstitious
and
credulous
than
any
logician
savage
curator
or
rustic
an
orthodox
demonstration
in
terms
of
which
we
shall
have
some
heresies
is
that
if
things
found
in
coal
could
have
got
there
only
by
falling
there
they
fell
there
so
in
the
lit
and
phil
soc
it
is
argued
that
certain
roundish
stones
that
have
been
found
in
coal
are
fossil
aerolites
that
they
had
fallen
from
the
sky
ages
ago
when
the
coal
was
soft
because
the
coal
had
closed
around
them
showing
no
sign
of
entrance
soc
of
antiq
of
that
in
a
lump
of
coal
from
a
mine
in
scotland
an
iron
instrument
had
been
found
the
interest
attaching
to
this
singular
relic
arises
from
the
fact
of
its
having
been
found
in
the
heart
of
a
piece
of
coal
seven
feet
under
the
surface
if
we
accept
that
this
object
of
iron
was
of
workmanship
beyond
the
means
and
skill
of
the
primitive
men
who
may
have
lived
in
scotland
when
coal
was
forming
there
the
instrument
was
considered
to
be
modern
that
our
expression
has
more
of
realness
or
higher
approximation
to
realness
than
has
the
attempt
to
explain
that
is
made
in
the
that
in
modern
times
someone
may
have
bored
for
coal
and
that
his
drill
may
have
broken
off
in
the
coal
it
had
penetrated
why
he
should
have
abandoned
such
easily
accessible
coal
i
do
know
the
important
point
is
that
there
was
no
sign
of
boring
that
this
instrument
was
in
a
lump
of
coal
that
had
closed
around
it
so
that
its
presence
was
not
suspected
until
the
lump
of
coal
was
broken
no
mention
can
i
find
of
this
damned
thing
in
any
other
publication
of
course
there
is
an
alternative
here
the
thing
may
not
have
fallen
from
the
sky
if
in
times
in
scotland
there
were
indigenous
to
this
earth
no
men
capable
of
making
such
an
iron
instrument
it
may
have
been
left
behind
by
visitors
from
other
worlds
in
an
extraordinary
approximation
to
fairness
and
justice
which
is
permitted
to
us
because
we
are
quite
as
desirous
to
make
acceptable
that
nothing
can
be
proved
as
we
are
to
sustain
our
own
expressions
we
note
that
in
and
there
is
an
account
of
an
ancient
copper
seal
about
the
size
of
a
penny
found
in
chalk
at
a
depth
of
from
five
to
six
feet
near
bredenstone
england
the
design
upon
it
is
said
to
be
of
a
monk
kneeling
before
a
virgin
and
child
a
legend
upon
the
margin
is
said
to
be
jordanis
monachi
spaldingie
i
do
know
about
that
it
looks
very
desirable
undesirable
to
us
there
a
wretch
of
an
thing
in
the
which
we
condemn
ourselves
if
somewhere
because
of
the
oneness
of
allness
the
damned
must
also
be
the
damning
it
a
newspaper
story
that
about
the
first
of
june
a
powerful
blast
near
dorchester
cast
out
from
a
bed
of
solid
rock
a
vessel
of
an
unknown
metal
floral
designs
inlaid
with
silver
art
of
some
cunning
workman
the
opinion
of
the
editor
of
the
is
that
the
thing
had
been
made
by
tubal
cain
who
was
the
first
inhabitant
of
dorchester
though
i
fear
that
this
is
a
little
arbitrary
i
am
not
disposed
to
fly
rabidly
at
every
scientific
opinion
a
block
of
metal
found
in
coal
in
austria
it
is
now
in
the
salsburg
museum
this
time
we
have
another
expression
usually
our
intermediatist
attack
upon
provincial
positivism
is
science
in
its
attempted
positivism
takes
something
such
as
true
meteoritic
material
as
a
standard
of
judgment
but
carbonaceous
matter
except
for
its
relative
infrequency
is
just
as
veritable
a
standard
of
judgment
carbonaceous
matter
merges
away
into
such
a
variety
of
organic
substances
that
all
standards
are
reduced
to
indistinguishability
if
then
there
is
no
real
standard
against
us
there
is
no
real
resistance
to
our
own
acceptances
now
our
intermediatism
is
science
takes
true
meteoritic
material
as
a
standard
of
admission
but
now
we
have
an
instance
that
quite
as
truly
makes
true
meteoritic
material
a
standard
of
exclusion
or
then
a
thing
that
denies
itself
is
no
real
resistance
to
our
own
acceptances
this
depending
upon
whether
we
have
a
datum
of
something
of
true
meteoritic
material
that
orthodoxy
can
never
accept
fell
from
the
sky
we
a
little
involved
here
our
own
acceptance
is
upon
a
carved
geometric
thing
that
if
found
in
a
very
old
deposit
antedates
human
life
except
perhaps
very
primitive
human
life
as
an
indigenous
product
of
this
earth
but
we
quite
as
much
interested
in
the
dilemma
it
made
for
the
faithful
it
is
of
true
meteoritic
material
it
is
said
that
though
so
geometric
its
phenomena
so
characteristic
of
meteorites
exclude
the
idea
that
it
was
the
work
of
man
as
to
the
deposit
tertiary
coal
composition
iron
carbon
and
a
small
quantity
of
nickel
it
has
the
pitted
surface
that
is
supposed
by
the
faithful
to
be
characteristic
of
meteorites
for
a
full
account
of
this
subject
see
the
scientists
who
examined
it
could
reach
no
agreement
they
bifurcated
then
a
compromise
was
suggested
but
the
compromise
is
a
product
of
disregard
that
it
was
of
true
meteoritic
material
and
had
not
been
shaped
by
man
that
it
was
not
of
true
meteoritic
material
but
telluric
iron
that
had
been
shaped
by
man
that
it
was
true
meteoritic
material
that
had
fallen
from
the
sky
but
had
been
shaped
by
man
after
its
fall
the
data
one
or
more
of
which
must
be
disregarded
by
each
of
these
three
explanations
are
true
meteoritic
material
and
surface
markings
of
meteorites
geometric
form
presence
in
an
ancient
deposit
material
as
hard
as
steel
absence
upon
this
earth
in
tertiary
times
of
men
who
could
work
in
material
as
hard
as
steel
it
is
said
that
though
of
true
meteoritic
material
this
object
is
virtually
a
steel
object
augustine
with
his
orthodoxy
was
never
in
well
very
much
worse
difficulties
than
are
the
faithful
here
by
due
disregard
of
a
datum
or
so
our
own
acceptance
that
it
was
a
steel
object
that
had
fallen
from
the
sky
to
this
earth
in
tertiary
times
is
not
forced
upon
one
we
offer
ours
as
the
only
synthetic
expression
for
instance
in
it
is
described
as
a
meteorite
in
this
account
there
is
nothing
alarming
to
the
pious
because
though
everything
else
is
told
its
geometric
form
is
not
mentioned
it
a
cube
there
is
a
deep
incision
all
around
it
of
its
faces
two
that
are
opposite
are
rounded
though
i
accept
that
our
own
expression
can
only
rather
approximate
to
truth
by
the
wideness
of
its
inclusions
and
because
it
seems
of
four
attempts
to
represent
the
only
complete
synthesis
and
can
be
nullified
or
greatly
modified
by
data
that
we
too
have
somewhere
disregarded
the
only
means
of
nullification
that
i
can
think
of
would
be
demonstration
that
this
object
is
a
mass
of
iron
pyrites
which
sometimes
forms
geometrically
but
the
analysis
mentions
not
a
trace
of
sulphur
of
course
our
weakness
or
impositiveness
lies
in
that
by
anyone
to
whom
it
would
be
agreeable
to
find
sulphur
in
this
thing
sulphur
would
be
found
in
it
by
our
own
intermediatism
there
is
some
sulphur
in
everything
or
sulphur
is
only
a
localization
or
emphasis
of
something
that
unemphasized
is
in
all
things
so
there
have
or
have
been
found
upon
this
earth
things
that
fell
from
the
sky
or
that
were
left
behind
by
visitors
to
this
earth
a
yarn
in
the
london
june
that
some
workmen
quarrying
rock
close
to
the
tweed
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
rutherford
mills
discovered
a
gold
thread
embedded
in
the
stone
at
a
depth
of
feet
that
a
piece
of
the
gold
thread
had
been
sent
to
the
office
of
the
pretty
little
thing
not
at
all
frowsy
rather
damnable
london
that
hiram
de
witt
of
springfield
returning
from
california
had
brought
with
him
a
piece
of
auriferous
quartz
about
the
size
of
a
man
fist
it
was
accidentally
dropped
split
open
nail
in
it
there
was
a
nail
size
of
a
nail
slightly
corroded
it
was
entirely
straight
and
had
a
perfect
head
or
california
ages
ago
when
auriferous
quartz
was
forming
million
of
miles
or
so
up
in
the
air
drops
a
nail
to
one
not
an
intermediatist
it
would
seem
incredible
that
this
datum
not
only
of
the
damned
but
of
the
lowest
of
the
damned
or
of
the
journalistic
caste
of
the
accursed
could
merge
away
with
something
else
damned
only
by
disregard
and
backed
by
what
is
called
highest
scientific
authority
communication
by
sir
david
brewster
brit
that
a
nail
had
been
found
in
a
block
of
stone
from
kingoodie
quarry
north
britain
the
block
in
which
the
nail
was
found
was
nine
inches
thick
but
as
to
what
part
of
the
quarry
it
had
come
from
there
is
no
evidence
except
that
it
could
not
have
been
from
the
surface
the
quarry
had
been
worked
about
twenty
years
it
consisted
of
alternate
layers
of
hard
stone
and
a
substance
called
till
the
point
of
the
nail
quite
eaten
with
rust
projected
into
some
till
upon
the
surface
of
the
block
of
stone
the
rest
of
the
nail
lay
upon
the
surface
of
the
stone
to
within
an
inch
of
the
head
that
inch
of
it
was
embedded
in
the
stone
although
its
caste
is
high
this
is
a
thing
profoundly
of
the
damned
sort
of
a
brahmin
as
regarded
by
a
baptist
its
case
was
stated
fairly
brewster
related
all
circumstances
available
to
him
but
there
was
no
discussion
at
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
no
explanation
was
offered
nevertheless
the
thing
can
be
nullified
but
the
nullification
that
we
find
is
as
much
against
orthodoxy
in
one
respect
as
it
is
against
our
own
expression
that
inclusion
in
quartz
or
sandstone
indicates
antiquity
or
there
would
have
to
be
a
revision
of
prevailing
dogmas
upon
quartz
and
sandstone
and
age
indicated
by
them
if
the
opposing
data
should
be
accepted
of
course
it
may
be
contended
by
both
the
orthodox
and
us
heretics
that
the
opposition
is
only
a
yarn
from
a
newspaper
by
an
odd
combination
we
find
our
two
lost
souls
that
have
tried
to
emerge
chucked
back
to
perdition
by
one
blow
sci
that
according
to
the
there
had
been
found
in
a
mine
quartz
crystals
that
could
have
had
only
years
in
which
to
form
that
where
a
mill
had
been
built
sandstone
had
been
found
when
the
mill
was
torn
down
that
had
hardened
in
years
that
in
this
sandstone
was
a
piece
of
wood
with
a
nail
in
it
of
scientific
that
at
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
sir
david
brewster
had
announced
that
he
had
to
bring
before
the
meeting
an
object
of
so
incredible
a
nature
that
nothing
short
of
the
strongest
evidence
was
necessary
to
render
the
statement
at
all
probable
a
crystal
lens
had
been
found
in
the
at
nineveh
in
many
of
the
temples
and
treasure
houses
of
old
civilizations
upon
this
earth
have
been
preserved
things
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
or
meteorites
again
we
have
a
brahmin
this
thing
is
buried
alive
in
the
heart
of
propriety
it
is
in
the
british
museum
carpenter
in
microscope
and
its
gives
two
drawings
of
it
carpenter
argues
that
it
is
impossible
to
accept
that
optical
lenses
had
ever
been
made
by
the
ancients
never
occurred
to
him
someone
a
million
miles
or
so
up
in
the
air
looking
through
his
telescope
lens
drops
out
this
does
not
appeal
to
carpenter
he
says
that
this
object
must
have
been
an
ornament
according
to
brewster
it
was
not
an
ornament
but
a
true
optical
lens
in
that
case
in
ruins
of
an
old
civilization
upon
this
earth
has
been
found
an
accursed
thing
that
was
acceptably
not
a
product
of
any
old
civilization
indigenous
to
this
earth
early
explorers
have
florida
mixed
up
with
newfoundland
but
the
confusion
is
worse
than
that
still
earlier
it
arises
from
simplicity
very
early
explorers
think
that
all
land
westward
is
one
land
india
awareness
of
other
lands
as
well
as
india
comes
as
a
slow
process
i
do
not
now
think
of
things
arriving
upon
this
earth
from
some
especial
other
world
that
was
my
notion
when
i
started
to
collect
our
data
or
as
is
a
commonplace
of
observation
all
intellection
begins
with
the
illusion
of
homogeneity
it
one
of
spencer
data
we
see
homogeneousness
in
all
things
distant
or
with
which
we
have
small
acquaintance
advance
from
the
relatively
homogeneous
to
the
relatively
heterogeneous
is
spencerian
philosophy
like
everything
else
not
that
it
was
really
spencer
discovery
but
was
taken
from
von
baer
who
in
turn
was
continuous
with
preceding
evolutionary
speculation
our
own
expression
is
that
all
things
are
acting
to
advance
to
the
homogeneous
or
are
trying
to
localize
homogeneousness
homogeneousness
is
an
aspect
of
the
universal
wherein
it
is
a
state
that
does
not
merge
away
into
something
else
we
regard
homogeneousness
as
an
aspect
of
positiveness
but
it
is
our
acceptance
that
infinite
frustrations
of
attempts
to
positivize
manifest
themselves
in
infinite
heterogeneity
so
that
though
things
try
to
localize
homogeneousness
they
end
up
in
heterogeneity
so
great
that
it
amounts
to
infinite
dispersion
or
indistinguishability
so
all
concepts
are
little
attempted
positivenesses
but
soon
have
to
give
in
to
compromise
modification
nullification
merging
away
into
indistinguishability
unless
here
and
there
in
the
world
history
there
may
have
been
a
who
for
only
an
infinitesimal
of
time
has
been
able
to
hold
out
against
heterogeneity
or
modification
or
doubt
or
listening
to
reason
or
loss
of
identity
in
which
case
instant
translation
to
heaven
or
the
positive
absolute
odd
thing
about
spencer
is
that
he
never
recognized
that
homogeneity
integration
and
definiteness
are
all
words
for
the
same
state
or
the
state
that
we
call
positiveness
what
we
call
his
mistake
is
in
that
he
regarded
homogeneousness
as
negative
i
began
with
a
notion
of
some
one
other
world
from
which
objects
and
substances
have
fallen
to
this
earth
which
had
or
which
to
less
degree
has
a
tutelary
interest
in
this
earth
which
is
now
attempting
to
communicate
with
this
earth
modifying
because
of
data
which
will
pile
up
later
into
acceptance
that
some
other
world
is
not
attempting
but
has
been
for
centuries
in
communication
with
a
sect
perhaps
or
a
secret
society
or
certain
esoteric
ones
of
this
earth
inhabitants
i
lose
a
great
deal
of
hypnotic
power
in
not
being
able
to
concentrate
attention
upon
some
one
other
world
as
i
have
admitted
before
i
intelligent
as
contrasted
with
the
orthodox
i
have
the
aristocratic
disregard
of
a
new
york
curator
or
an
eskimo
i
have
to
dissipate
myself
in
acceptance
of
a
host
of
other
worlds
size
of
the
moon
some
of
them
one
of
them
at
least
tremendous
thing
we
take
that
up
later
vast
amorphous
aerial
regions
to
which
such
definite
words
as
worlds
and
planets
seem
inapplicable
and
artificial
constructions
that
i
have
called
one
of
them
about
the
size
of
brooklyn
i
should
say
offhand
and
one
or
more
of
them
things
a
goodly
number
of
square
miles
in
area
i
think
that
earlier
in
this
book
before
we
liberalized
into
embracing
everything
that
comes
along
your
indignation
or
indigestion
would
have
expressed
in
the
notion
that
if
this
were
so
astronomers
would
have
seen
these
other
worlds
and
regions
and
vast
geometric
constructions
you
have
had
that
notion
you
have
stopped
there
but
the
attempt
to
stop
is
saying
enough
to
the
insatiable
in
cosmic
punctuation
there
are
no
periods
illusion
of
periods
is
incomplete
view
of
colons
and
we
ca
stop
with
the
notion
that
if
there
were
such
phenomena
astronomers
would
have
seen
them
because
of
our
experience
with
suppression
and
disregard
we
suspect
before
we
go
into
the
subject
at
all
that
astronomers
have
seen
them
that
navigators
and
meteorologists
have
seen
them
that
individual
scientists
and
other
trained
observers
have
seen
them
many
times
that
it
is
the
system
that
has
excluded
data
of
them
as
to
the
law
of
gravitation
and
astronomers
formulas
remember
that
these
formulas
worked
out
in
the
time
of
laplace
as
well
as
they
do
now
but
there
are
hundreds
of
planetary
bodies
now
known
that
were
then
not
known
so
a
few
hundred
worlds
more
of
ours
wo
make
any
difference
laplace
knew
of
about
only
thirty
bodies
in
this
solar
system
about
six
hundred
are
recognized
now
what
are
the
discoveries
of
geology
and
biology
to
a
theologian
his
formulas
still
work
out
as
well
as
they
ever
did
if
the
law
of
gravitation
could
be
stated
as
a
real
utterance
it
might
be
a
real
resistance
to
us
but
we
are
told
only
that
gravitation
is
gravitation
of
course
to
an
intermediatist
nothing
can
be
defined
except
in
terms
of
itself
but
even
the
orthodox
in
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
innate
premonitions
of
realness
not
founded
upon
experience
agree
that
to
define
a
thing
in
terms
of
itself
is
not
real
definition
it
is
said
that
by
gravitation
is
meant
the
attraction
of
all
things
proportionately
to
mass
and
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
mass
would
mean
holding
together
final
particles
if
there
were
final
particles
then
until
final
particles
be
discovered
only
one
term
of
this
expression
survives
or
mass
is
attraction
but
distance
is
only
extent
of
mass
unless
one
holds
out
for
absolute
vacuum
among
planets
a
position
against
which
we
could
bring
a
host
of
data
but
there
is
no
possible
means
of
expressing
that
gravitation
is
anything
other
than
attraction
so
there
is
nothing
to
resist
us
but
such
a
phantom
as
that
gravitation
is
the
gravitation
of
all
gravitations
proportionately
to
gravitation
and
inversely
as
the
square
of
gravitation
in
a
nothing
more
sensible
than
this
can
be
said
upon
any
subject
perhaps
there
are
higher
approximations
to
ultimate
sensibleness
nevertheless
we
seem
to
have
a
feeling
that
with
the
system
against
us
we
have
a
kind
of
resistance
here
we
have
felt
so
formerly
at
any
rate
i
think
the
grays
and
hitchcocks
have
modified
our
trustfulness
toward
indistinguishability
as
to
the
perfection
of
this
system
that
us
and
the
infallibility
of
its
mathematics
as
if
there
could
be
real
mathematics
in
a
mode
of
seeming
where
twice
two
are
not
four
we
been
told
over
and
over
of
their
vindication
in
the
discovery
of
neptune
i
afraid
that
the
course
we
taking
will
turn
out
like
every
other
development
we
began
humbly
admitting
that
we
of
the
damned
but
our
eyebrows
just
a
faint
flicker
in
them
or
in
one
of
them
every
time
we
hear
of
the
triumphal
discovery
of
neptune
this
monumental
achievement
of
theoretical
astronomy
as
the
call
it
the
whole
trouble
is
that
we
looked
it
up
the
omit
this
that
instead
of
the
orbit
of
neptune
agreeing
with
the
calculations
of
adams
and
leverrier
it
was
so
different
that
leverrier
said
that
it
was
not
the
planet
of
his
calculations
later
it
was
thought
best
to
say
no
more
upon
that
subject
the
omit
this
that
in
everyone
who
knew
a
sine
from
a
cosine
was
out
sining
and
cosining
for
a
planet
beyond
uranus
two
of
them
guessed
right
to
some
minds
even
after
leverrier
own
rejection
of
neptune
the
word
guessed
may
be
objectionable
but
according
to
peirce
of
harvard
the
calculations
of
adams
and
leverrier
would
have
applied
quite
as
well
to
positions
many
degrees
from
the
position
of
neptune
or
for
peirce
demonstration
that
the
discovery
of
neptune
was
only
a
happy
accident
see
amer
acad
for
references
see
lowell
of
or
comets
another
nebulous
resistance
to
our
own
notions
as
to
eclipses
i
have
notes
upon
several
of
them
that
did
not
occur
upon
scheduled
time
though
with
differences
only
of
seconds
and
one
delightful
lost
soul
but
buried
in
the
records
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
upon
an
eclipse
that
did
not
occur
at
all
that
delightful
thing
of
perdition
is
too
good
and
malicious
to
be
dismissed
with
passing
notice
we
have
him
later
throughout
the
history
of
astronomy
every
comet
that
has
come
back
upon
predicted
time
not
that
essentially
there
was
anything
more
abstruse
about
it
than
is
a
prediction
that
you
can
make
of
a
periodicities
tomorrow
was
advertised
for
all
it
was
worth
it
the
way
reputations
are
worked
up
for
by
the
faithful
the
comets
that
did
come
back
omitted
or
explained
or
encke
comet
it
came
back
slower
and
slower
but
the
astronomers
explained
be
almost
absolutely
sure
of
that
they
explained
they
had
it
all
worked
out
and
formulated
and
proved
why
that
comet
was
coming
back
slower
and
slower
and
there
the
damn
thing
began
coming
faster
and
faster
halley
comet
astronomy
the
perfect
science
as
we
astronomers
like
to
call
it
jacoby
it
my
own
notion
that
if
in
a
real
existence
an
astronomer
could
not
tell
one
longitude
from
another
he
be
sent
back
to
this
purgatory
of
ours
until
he
could
meet
that
simple
requirement
halley
was
sent
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
to
determine
its
longitude
he
got
it
degrees
wrong
he
gave
to
africa
noble
roman
promontory
a
retrouss√©
twist
that
would
take
the
pride
out
of
any
kaffir
we
hear
everlastingly
of
halley
comet
it
came
back
maybe
but
unless
we
look
the
matter
up
in
contemporaneous
records
we
hear
nothing
of
the
leonids
for
instance
by
the
same
methods
as
those
by
which
halley
comet
was
predicted
the
leonids
were
predicted
november
no
leonids
it
was
explained
they
had
been
perturbed
they
would
appear
in
november
november
november
no
leonids
my
notion
of
astronomic
accuracy
who
could
not
be
a
prize
marksman
if
only
his
hits
be
recorded
as
to
halley
comet
of
everybody
now
swears
he
saw
it
he
has
to
perjure
himself
otherwise
he
be
accused
of
having
no
interest
in
great
inspiring
things
that
he
never
given
any
attention
to
regard
this
that
there
never
is
a
moment
when
there
is
not
some
comet
in
the
sky
virtually
there
is
no
year
in
which
several
new
comets
are
not
discovered
so
plentiful
are
they
luminous
fleas
on
a
vast
black
dog
in
popular
impressions
there
is
no
realization
of
the
extent
to
which
this
solar
system
is
if
a
comet
have
not
the
orbit
that
astronomers
have
predicted
perturbed
if
like
halley
comet
it
be
late
even
a
year
late
perturbed
when
a
train
is
an
hour
late
we
have
small
opinion
of
the
predictions
of
timetables
when
a
comet
a
year
late
all
we
ask
is
that
it
be
explained
we
hear
of
the
inflation
and
arrogance
of
astronomers
my
own
acceptance
is
not
that
they
are
imposing
upon
us
that
they
are
requiting
us
for
many
of
us
priests
no
longer
function
to
give
us
seeming
rapport
with
perfection
infallibility
the
positive
absolute
astronomers
have
stepped
forward
to
fill
a
vacancy
with
but
in
our
acceptance
with
a
higher
approximation
to
substantiality
than
had
the
attenuations
that
preceded
them
i
should
say
myself
that
all
that
we
call
progress
is
not
so
much
response
to
urge
as
it
is
response
to
a
hiatus
or
if
you
want
something
to
grow
somewhere
dig
out
everything
else
in
its
area
so
i
have
to
accept
that
the
positive
assurances
of
astronomers
are
necessary
to
us
or
the
blunderings
evasions
and
disguises
of
astronomers
would
never
be
tolerated
that
given
such
latitude
as
they
are
permitted
to
take
they
could
not
be
very
disastrously
mistaken
suppose
the
comet
called
halley
had
not
appeared
early
in
a
far
more
important
comet
than
the
an√¶mic
luminosity
said
to
be
halley
appeared
it
was
so
brilliant
that
it
was
visible
in
daylight
the
astronomers
would
have
been
saved
anyway
if
this
other
comet
did
not
have
the
predicted
orbit
perturbation
if
you
going
to
coney
island
and
predict
there
be
a
special
kind
of
a
pebble
on
the
beach
i
do
see
how
you
can
disgrace
yourself
if
some
other
pebble
will
do
just
as
well
because
the
feeble
thing
said
to
have
been
seen
in
was
no
more
in
accord
with
the
sensational
descriptions
given
out
by
astronomers
in
advance
than
is
a
pale
pebble
with
a
boulder
i
predict
that
next
wednesday
a
large
chinaman
in
evening
clothes
will
cross
broadway
at
street
at
he
does
but
a
tubercular
jap
in
a
sailor
uniform
does
cross
broadway
at
street
friday
at
noon
well
a
jap
is
a
perturbed
chinaman
and
clothes
are
clothes
i
remember
the
terrifying
predictions
made
by
the
honest
and
credulous
astronomers
who
must
have
been
themselves
hypnotized
or
they
could
not
have
hypnotized
the
rest
of
us
in
wills
were
made
human
life
might
be
swept
from
this
planet
in
which
is
essentially
hibernian
that
would
be
no
reason
why
wills
should
not
be
made
the
less
excitable
of
us
did
expect
at
least
some
pretty
good
fireworks
i
have
to
admit
that
it
is
said
that
in
new
york
a
light
was
seen
in
the
sky
it
was
about
as
terrifying
as
the
scratch
of
a
match
on
the
seat
of
some
breeches
half
a
mile
away
it
was
not
on
time
though
i
have
heard
that
a
faint
nebulosity
which
i
did
not
see
myself
though
i
looked
when
i
was
told
to
look
was
seen
in
the
sky
it
appeared
several
days
after
the
time
predicted
a
hypnotized
host
of
imbeciles
of
us
told
to
look
up
at
the
sky
we
did
like
a
lot
of
pointers
hypnotized
by
a
partridge
the
effect
almost
everybody
now
swears
that
he
saw
halley
comet
and
that
it
was
a
glorious
spectacle
an
interesting
circumstance
here
is
that
seemingly
we
are
trying
to
discredit
astronomers
because
astronomers
oppose
us
that
not
my
impression
we
shall
be
in
the
brahmin
caste
of
the
hell
of
the
baptists
almost
all
our
data
in
some
regiments
of
this
procession
are
observations
by
astronomers
few
of
them
mere
amateur
astronomers
it
is
the
system
that
opposes
us
it
is
the
system
that
is
suppressing
astronomers
i
think
we
pity
them
in
their
captivity
ours
is
not
malice
in
a
positive
sense
it
chivalry
somewhat
unhappy
astronomers
looking
out
from
high
towers
in
which
they
are
imprisoned
we
appear
upon
the
horizon
but
as
i
have
said
our
data
do
not
relate
to
some
especial
other
world
i
mean
very
much
what
a
savage
upon
an
ocean
island
might
vaguely
think
of
in
his
speculations
not
upon
some
other
land
but
complexes
of
continents
and
their
phenomena
cities
factories
in
cities
means
of
communication
now
all
the
other
savages
would
know
of
a
few
vessels
sailing
in
their
regular
routes
passing
this
island
in
regularized
periodicities
the
tendency
in
these
minds
would
be
expression
of
the
universal
tendency
toward
positivism
or
completeness
or
conviction
that
these
few
regularized
vessels
constituted
all
now
i
think
of
some
especial
savage
who
suspects
otherwise
because
he
very
backward
and
unimaginative
and
insensible
to
the
beautiful
ideals
of
the
others
not
piously
occupied
like
the
others
in
bowing
before
sticks
of
wood
dishonestly
taking
time
for
his
speculations
while
the
others
are
patriotically
so
the
other
higher
and
nobler
savages
know
about
the
few
regularized
vessels
know
when
to
expect
them
have
their
periodicities
all
worked
out
just
about
when
vessels
will
pass
or
eclipse
each
other
explaining
that
all
vagaries
were
due
to
atmospheric
conditions
they
come
out
strong
in
explaining
you
ca
read
a
book
upon
savages
without
noting
what
resolute
explainers
they
are
they
say
that
all
this
mechanism
was
founded
upon
the
mutual
attraction
of
the
vessels
deduced
from
the
fall
of
a
monkey
from
a
palm
tree
or
if
not
that
that
devils
were
pushing
the
vessels
something
of
the
kind
storms
d√©bris
not
from
these
vessels
cast
up
by
the
waves
disregarded
how
can
one
think
of
something
and
something
else
too
i
in
the
state
of
mind
of
a
savage
who
might
find
upon
a
shore
washed
up
by
the
same
storm
buoyant
parts
of
a
piano
and
a
paddle
that
was
carved
by
cruder
hands
than
his
own
something
light
and
summery
from
india
and
a
fur
overcoat
from
russia
or
all
science
though
approximating
wider
and
wider
is
attempt
to
conceive
of
india
in
terms
of
an
ocean
island
and
of
russia
in
terms
of
india
so
interpreted
though
i
am
trying
to
think
of
russia
and
india
in
terms
i
can
not
think
that
that
or
the
universalizing
of
the
local
is
cosmic
purpose
the
higher
idealist
is
the
positivist
who
tries
to
localize
the
universal
and
is
in
accord
with
cosmic
purpose
the
of
a
local
savage
who
can
hold
out
without
a
flurry
of
doubt
that
a
piano
washed
up
on
a
beach
is
the
trunk
of
a
palm
tree
that
a
shark
has
bitten
leaving
his
teeth
in
it
so
we
fear
for
the
soul
of
gray
because
he
did
not
devote
his
whole
life
to
that
one
stand
that
whether
possible
or
inconceivable
thousands
of
fishes
had
been
cast
from
one
bucket
so
unfortunately
for
myself
if
salvation
be
desirable
i
look
out
widely
but
amorphously
indefinitely
and
heterogeneously
if
i
say
i
conceive
of
another
world
that
is
now
in
secret
communication
with
certain
esoteric
inhabitants
of
this
earth
i
say
i
conceive
of
still
other
worlds
that
are
trying
to
establish
communication
with
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
earth
i
fit
my
notions
to
the
data
i
find
that
is
supposed
to
be
the
right
and
logical
and
scientific
thing
to
do
but
it
is
no
way
to
approximate
to
form
system
organization
then
i
think
i
conceive
of
other
worlds
and
vast
structures
that
pass
us
by
within
a
few
miles
without
the
slightest
desire
to
communicate
quite
as
tramp
vessels
pass
many
islands
without
particularizing
one
from
another
then
i
think
i
have
data
of
a
vast
construction
that
has
often
come
to
this
earth
dipped
into
an
ocean
submerged
there
a
while
then
going
away
why
i
not
absolutely
sure
how
would
an
eskimo
explain
a
vessel
sending
ashore
for
coal
which
is
plentiful
upon
some
arctic
beaches
though
of
unknown
use
to
the
natives
then
sailing
away
with
no
interest
in
the
natives
a
great
difficulty
in
trying
to
understand
vast
constructions
that
show
no
interest
in
us
the
notion
that
we
must
be
interesting
i
accept
that
though
we
usually
avoided
probably
for
moral
reasons
sometimes
this
earth
has
been
visited
by
explorers
i
think
that
the
notion
that
there
have
been
visitors
to
china
within
what
we
call
the
historic
period
will
be
only
ordinarily
absurd
when
we
come
to
that
datum
i
accept
that
some
of
the
other
worlds
are
of
conditions
very
similar
to
our
own
i
think
of
others
that
are
very
different
so
that
visitors
from
them
could
not
live
here
without
artificial
adaptations
how
some
of
them
could
breathe
our
attenuated
air
if
they
came
from
a
gelatinous
atmosphere
masks
the
masks
that
have
been
found
in
ancient
deposits
most
of
them
are
of
stone
and
are
said
to
have
been
ceremonial
regalia
of
savages
but
the
mask
that
was
found
in
sullivan
county
missouri
in
it
is
made
of
iron
and
silver
one
of
the
damnedest
in
our
whole
saturnalia
of
the
accursed
because
it
is
hopeless
to
try
to
shake
off
an
excommunication
only
by
saying
that
we
damned
by
blacker
things
than
ourselves
and
that
the
damned
are
those
who
admit
they
of
the
damned
inertia
and
hypnosis
are
too
strong
for
us
we
say
that
then
we
go
right
on
admitting
of
the
damned
it
is
only
by
being
more
nearly
real
that
we
can
sweep
away
the
that
oppose
us
of
course
as
a
whole
we
have
considerable
amorphousness
but
we
are
thinking
now
of
individual
acceptances
wideness
is
an
aspect
of
universalness
or
realness
if
our
syntheses
disregard
fewer
data
than
do
opposing
syntheses
which
are
often
not
syntheses
at
all
but
mere
consideration
of
some
one
circumstance
less
widely
synthetic
things
fade
away
before
us
harmony
is
an
aspect
of
the
universal
by
which
we
mean
realness
if
we
approximate
more
highly
to
harmony
among
the
parts
of
an
expression
and
to
all
available
circumstances

an
occurrence
the
turn

an

up

they

one
of
the
damnedest
of
our
data
in
the
charles
holder
writes
many
years
ago
a
strange
stone
resembling
a
meteorite
fell
into
the
valley
of
the
yaqui
mexico
and
the
sensational
story
went
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
country
that
a
stone
bearing
human
inscriptions
had
descended
to
the
earth
the
bewildering
observation
here
is
holder
assertion
that
this
stone
did
fall
it
seems
to
me
that
he
must
mean
that
it
fell
by
dislodgment
from
a
mountainside
into
a
valley
but
we
shall
see
that
it
was
such
a
marked
stone
that
very
unlikely
would
it
have
been
unknown
to
dwellers
in
a
valley
if
it
had
been
reposing
upon
a
mountainside
above
them
it
may
have
been
carelessness
intent
may
have
been
to
say
that
a
sensational
story
of
a
strange
stone
said
to
have
fallen
etc
this
stone
was
reported
by
major
frederick
burnham
of
the
british
army
later
major
burnham
revisited
it
and
holder
accompanied
him
their
purpose
to
decipher
the
inscriptions
upon
it
if
possible
this
stone
was
a
brown
igneous
rock
its
longest
axis
about
eight
feet
and
on
the
eastern
face
which
had
an
angle
of
about
degrees
was
the
inscription
holder
says
that
he
recognized
familiar
mayan
symbols
in
the
inscription
his
method
was
the
usual
method
by
which
anything
can
be
identified
as
anything
else
that
is
to
pick
out
whatever
is
agreeable
and
disregard
the
rest
he
says
that
he
has
demonstrated
that
most
of
the
symbols
are
mayan
one
of
our
intermediatist
is
that
any
way
of
demonstrating
anything
is
just
as
good
a
way
of
demonstrating
anything
else
by
holder
method
we
could
demonstrate
that
we
mayan
if
that
should
be
a
source
of
pride
to
us
one
of
the
characters
upon
this
stone
is
a
circle
within
a
circle
similar
character
found
by
holder
is
a
mayan
manuscript
there
are
two
can
be
found
in
mayan
manuscripts
a
double
scroll
there
are
dots
and
there
are
dashes
well
then
we
in
turn
disregard
the
circle
within
a
circle
and
the
double
scroll
and
emphasize
that
occur
in
this
book
and
that
dots
are
plentiful
and
would
be
more
plentiful
if
it
were
customary
to
use
the
small
i
for
the
first
personal
pronoun
that
when
it
comes
to
dashes
that
demonstrated
we
mayan
i
suppose
the
tendency
is
to
feel
that
we
sneering
at
some
valuable
archaeologic
work
and
that
holder
did
make
a
veritable
identification
he
writes
i
submitted
the
photographs
to
the
field
museum
and
the
smithsonian
and
one
or
two
others
and
to
my
surprise
the
reply
was
that
they
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
our
indefinite
acceptance
by
preponderance
of
three
or
four
groups
of
against
one
person
is
that
a
stone
bearing
inscriptions
unassimilable
with
any
known
language
upon
this
earth
is
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
another
poor
wretch
of
an
outcast
belonging
here
is
noted
in
the
that
of
an
object
or
a
meteorite
that
fell
near
brescia
italy
a
false
report
was
circulated
that
one
of
the
fragments
bore
the
impress
of
a
hand
that
all
that
is
findable
by
me
upon
this
mere
gasp
of
a
thing
intermediatistically
my
acceptance
is
that
though
in
the
course
of
human
history
there
have
been
some
notable
approximations
there
never
has
been
a
real
liar
that
he
could
not
survive
in
intermediateness
where
everything
merges
away
or
has
its
in
something
else
would
be
instantly
translated
to
the
negative
absolute
so
my
acceptance
is
that
though
curtly
dismissed
there
was
something
to
base
upon
in
this
report
that
there
were
unusual
markings
upon
this
object
of
course
that
is
not
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
cuneiform
characters
that
looked
like
altogether
i
think
that
in
some
of
our
past
expressions
we
must
have
been
very
efficient
if
the
experience
of
symons
be
typical
so
indefinite
are
we
becoming
here
just
here
we
are
interested
in
many
things
that
have
been
found
especially
in
the
united
states
which
speak
of
a
civilization
or
of
many
civilizations
not
indigenous
to
this
earth
one
trouble
is
in
trying
to
decide
whether
they
fell
here
from
the
sky
or
were
left
behind
by
visitors
from
other
worlds
we
have
a
notion
that
there
have
been
disasters
aloft
and
that
coins
have
dropped
here
that
inhabitants
of
this
earth
found
them
or
saw
them
fall
and
then
made
coins
imitatively
it
may
be
that
coins
were
showered
here
by
something
of
a
tutelary
nature
that
undertook
to
advance
us
from
the
stage
of
barter
to
the
use
of
a
medium
if
coins
should
be
identified
as
roman
coins
we
had
so
much
experience
with
identifications
that
we
know
a
phantom
when
we
see
one
but
even
so
how
could
roman
coins
have
got
to
north
america
far
in
the
interior
of
north
america
or
buried
under
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
soil
unless
they
did
drop
from
wherever
the
first
romans
came
from
ignatius
donnelly
in
gives
a
list
of
objects
that
have
been
found
in
mounds
that
are
supposed
to
antedate
all
european
influence
in
america
articles
such
as
traders
from
somewhere
would
supply
to
savages
marks
of
the
lathe
said
to
be
unmistakable
said
to
be
of
course
we
ca
accept
that
anything
is
unmistakable
in
the
smithson
there
is
an
account
by
charles
jones
of
two
silver
crosses
that
were
found
in
georgia
they
are
skillfully
made
highly
ornamented
crosses
but
are
not
conventional
crucifixes
all
arms
of
equal
length
jones
is
a
good
positivist
that
de
sota
had
halted
at
the
precise
spot
where
these
crosses
were
found
but
the
spirit
of
negativeness
that
lurks
in
all
things
said
to
be
precise
shows
itself
in
that
upon
one
of
these
crosses
is
an
inscription
that
has
no
meaning
in
spanish
or
any
other
known
terrestrial
language
iynkicidu
according
to
jones
he
thinks
that
this
is
a
name
and
that
there
is
an
aboriginal
ring
to
it
though
i
should
say
myself
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
incas
that
the
spanish
donor
cut
on
the
cross
the
name
of
an
indian
to
whom
it
was
presented
but
we
look
at
the
inscription
ourselves
and
see
that
the
letters
said
to
be
c
and
d
are
turned
the
wrong
way
and
that
the
letter
said
to
be
k
is
not
only
turned
the
wrong
way
but
is
upside
down
it
is
difficult
to
accept
that
the
remarkable
the
very
extensive
copper
mines
in
the
region
of
lake
superior
were
ever
the
works
of
american
aborigines
despite
the
astonishing
extent
of
these
mines
nothing
has
ever
been
found
to
indicate
that
the
region
was
ever
inhabited
by
permanent
dwellers
not
a
vestige
of
a
dwelling
a
skeleton
or
a
bone
has
been
found
the
indians
have
no
traditions
relating
to
the
mines
i
think
that
had
visitors
that
they
have
come
here
for
copper
for
instance
as
to
other
relics
of
them
but
we
now
come
upon
frequency
of
a
merger
that
has
not
so
often
appeared
before
fraudulency
hair
called
real
hair
then
there
are
wigs
teeth
called
real
teeth
then
there
are
false
teeth
official
money
counterfeit
money
it
the
bane
of
psychic
research
if
there
be
psychic
phenomena
there
must
be
fraudulent
psychic
phenomena
so
desperate
is
the
situation
here
that
carrington
argues
that
even
if
palladino
be
caught
cheating
that
is
not
to
say
that
all
her
phenomena
are
fraudulent
my
own
version
is
that
nothing
indicates
anything
in
a
positive
sense
because
in
a
positive
sense
there
is
nothing
to
be
indicated
everything
that
is
called
true
must
merge
away
indistinguishably
into
something
called
false
both
are
expressions
of
the
same
underlying
quasiness
and
are
continuous
fraudulent
antiquarian
relics
are
very
common
but
they
are
not
more
common
than
are
fraudulent
paintings
forest
sketches
of
norfolk
that
in
september
when
some
workmen
near
norfolk
were
boring
for
water
a
coin
was
drawn
up
from
a
depth
of
about
feet
it
was
about
the
size
of
an
english
shilling
but
oval
an
oval
disk
if
not
a
coin
the
figures
upon
it
were
distinct
and
represented
a
warrior
or
hunter
and
other
characters
apparently
of
roman
origin
the
means
of
exclusion
would
probably
be
men
digging
a
hole
no
one
else
looking
one
of
them
drops
a
coin
into
the
hole
as
to
where
he
got
a
strange
coin
remarkable
in
shape
even
that
disregarded
up
comes
the
coin
expressions
of
astonishment
from
the
evil
one
who
had
dropped
it
however
the
antiquarians
have
missed
this
coin
i
can
find
no
other
mention
of
it
another
coin
also
a
little
study
in
the
genesis
of
a
prophet
in
the
is
copied
a
story
by
a
correspondent
to
the
of
a
copper
coin
about
the
size
of
a
piece
said
to
have
been
found
in
a
michigan
mound
the
editor
says
merely
that
he
does
not
endorse
the
find
upon
this
slender
basis
he
buds
out
in
the
next
number
of
the
the
coin
turns
out
as
we
predicted
to
be
a
fraud
you
can
imagine
the
scorn
of
elijah
or
any
of
the
old
more
nearly
real
prophets
or
all
things
are
tried
by
the
only
kind
of
jurisprudence
we
have
in
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
convicted
but
they
guilty
the
editor
reasoning
is
as
as
my
own
or
paul
or
darwin
the
coin
is
condemned
because
it
came
from
the
same
region
from
which
a
few
years
before
had
come
pottery
that
had
been
called
fraudulent
the
pottery
had
been
condemned
because
it
was
condemnable
june
that
a
farmer
in
cass
had
picked
up
on
his
farm
a
bronze
coin
which
was
sent
to
hilder
of
louis
who
identified
it
as
a
coin
of
antiochus
iv
inscription
said
to
be
in
ancient
greek
characters
translated
as
king
antiochus
epiphanes
illustrious
the
victorius
sounds
quite
definite
and
convincing
but
we
have
some
more
translations
coming
in
the
are
shown
two
faces
of
a
copper
coin
with
characters
very
much
like
those
upon
the
grave
creek
stone
which
with
translations
we
take
up
soon
this
coin
is
said
to
have
been
found
in
connecticut
in
of
the
that
early
in
a
coin
said
to
be
a
roman
coin
was
reported
as
discovered
in
an
illinois
mound
it
was
sent
to
emerson
of
the
art
institute
of
chicago
his
opinion
was
that
the
coin
is
of
the
rare
mintage
of
domitius
domitianus
emperor
in
egypt
as
to
its
discovery
in
an
illinois
mound
emerson
disclaims
responsibility
but
what
strikes
me
here
is
that
a
joker
should
not
have
been
satisfied
with
an
ordinary
roman
coin
where
did
he
get
a
rare
coin
and
why
was
it
not
missed
from
some
collection
i
have
looked
over
numismatic
journals
enough
to
accept
that
the
whereabouts
of
every
rare
coin
in
possession
is
known
to
seems
to
me
nothing
left
but
to
call
this
another
identification
amer
phil
that
in
july
a
letter
was
received
from
jacob
moffit
of
chillicothe
enclosing
a
photograph
of
a
coin
which
he
said
had
been
brought
up
by
him
while
boring
from
a
depth
of
feet
of
course
by
conventional
scientific
standards
such
depth
has
some
extraordinary
meaning
palaeontologists
geologists
and
archaeologists
consider
themselves
reasonable
in
arguing
ancient
origin
of
the
we
only
accept
depth
is
a
with
us
one
earthquake
could
bury
a
coin
of
recent
mintage
feet
below
the
surface
according
to
a
writer
in
the
the
coin
is
uniform
in
thickness
and
had
never
been
hammered
out
by
savages
there
are
other
tokens
of
the
machine
shop
but
according
to
leslie
it
is
an
astrologic
amulet
there
are
upon
it
the
signs
of
pisces
and
leo
or
with
due
disregard
you
can
find
signs
of
your
or
of
the
crusades
or
of
the
mayans
upon
anything
that
ever
came
from
chillicothe
or
from
a
five
and
ten
cent
store
anything
that
looks
like
a
cat
and
a
goldfish
looks
like
leo
and
pisces
but
by
due
suppressions
and
distortions
there
nothing
that
ca
be
made
to
look
like
a
cat
and
a
goldfish
i
fear
me
we
turning
a
little
irritable
here
to
be
damned
by
slumbering
giants
and
interesting
little
harlots
and
clowns
who
rank
high
in
their
profession
is
at
least
supportable
to
our
vanity
but
we
find
that
the
anthropologists
are
of
the
slums
of
the
divine
or
of
an
archaic
kindergarten
of
intellectuality
and
it
is
very
unflattering
to
find
a
mess
of
moldy
infants
sitting
in
judgment
upon
us
leslie
then
finds
as
arbitrarily
as
one
might
find
that
some
joker
put
the
brooklyn
bridge
where
it
is
that
the
piece
was
placed
there
as
a
practical
joke
though
not
by
its
present
owner
and
is
a
modern
fabrication
perhaps
of
the
sixteenth
century
possibly
or
origin
it
sheer
brutal
attempt
to
assimilate
a
thing
that
may
or
may
not
have
fallen
from
the
sky
with
phenomena
admitted
by
the
anthropologic
system
or
with
the
early
french
or
spanish
explorers
of
illinois
though
it
is
ridiculous
in
a
positive
sense
to
give
reasons
it
is
more
acceptable
to
attempt
reasons
more
nearly
real
than
opposing
reasons
of
course
in
his
favor
we
note
that
leslie
qualifies
his
notions
but
his
disregards
are
that
there
is
nothing
either
french
or
spanish
about
this
coin
a
legend
upon
it
is
said
to
be
somewhere
between
arabic
and
phoenician
without
being
either
winchell
from
a
geologist
says
of
the
crude
designs
upon
this
coin
which
was
in
his
possession
scrawls
of
an
animal
and
of
a
warrior
or
of
a
cat
and
a
goldfish
whichever
be
convenient
that
they
had
been
neither
stamped
nor
engraved
but
looked
as
if
etched
with
an
acid
that
is
a
method
unknown
in
numismatics
of
this
earth
as
to
the
crudity
of
design
upon
this
coin
and
something
else
that
though
the
warrior
may
be
by
due
disregards
either
a
cat
or
a
goldfish
we
have
to
note
that
his
headdress
is
typical
of
the
american
indian
could
be
explained
of
course
but
for
fear
that
we
might
be
instantly
translated
to
the
positive
absolute
which
may
not
be
absolutely
desirable
we
prefer
to
have
some
flaws
or
negativeness
in
our
own
expressions
data
of
more
than
the
tablets
of
stone
with
the
ten
commandments
engraved
upon
them
in
hebrew
said
to
have
been
found
in
mounds
in
the
united
states
masonic
emblems
said
to
have
been
found
in
mounds
in
the
united
states
we
upon
the
borderline
of
our
acceptances
and
we
amorphous
in
the
uncertainties
and
mergings
of
our
outline
conventionally
or
with
no
real
reason
for
so
doing
we
exclude
these
things
and
then
as
grossly
and
arbitrarily
and
irrationally
though
our
attempt
is
always
to
approximate
away
from
these
negative
states
as
ever
a
kepler
newton
or
darwin
made
his
selections
without
which
he
could
not
have
seemed
to
be
at
all
because
every
one
of
them
is
now
seen
to
be
an
illusion
we
accept
that
other
lettered
things
have
been
found
in
mounds
in
the
united
states
of
course
we
do
what
we
can
to
make
the
selection
seem
not
gross
and
arbitrary
and
irrational
then
if
we
accept
that
inscribed
things
of
ancient
origin
have
been
found
in
the
united
states
that
can
not
be
attributed
to
any
race
indigenous
to
the
western
hemisphere
that
are
not
in
any
language
ever
heard
of
in
the
eastern
hemisphere
there
nothing
to
it
but
to
turn
and
try
to
conceive
of
a
third
hemisphere
or
to
accept
that
there
has
been
intercourse
between
the
western
hemisphere
and
some
other
world
but
there
is
a
peculiarity
to
these
inscribed
objects
they
remind
me
of
the
records
left
by
sir
john
franklin
in
the
arctic
but
also
of
attempts
made
by
relief
expeditions
to
communicate
with
the
franklin
expedition
the
lost
explorers
cached
their
records
or
concealed
them
conspicuously
in
mounds
the
relief
expeditions
sent
up
balloons
from
which
messages
were
dropped
broadcast
our
data
are
of
things
that
have
been
cached
and
of
things
that
seem
to
have
been
dropped
or
a
lost
expedition
from
somewhere
explorers
from
somewhere
and
their
inability
to
return
then
a
long
sentimental
persistent
attempt
in
the
spirit
of
our
own
arctic
at
least
to
establish
communication
what
if
it
may
have
succeeded
we
think
of
india
the
millions
of
natives
who
are
ruled
by
a
small
band
of
esoterics
only
because
they
receive
support
and
direction
from
somewhere
else
or
from
england
in
tomlinson

expert
in
these
matters
says
that
the
stone
is
now
universally
regarded
by
archaeologists
as
a
fraud
that
in
his
opinion
tomlinson
had
been
imposed
upon
avebury
i
mention
it
because
it
has
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
but
it
is
now
generally
admitted
to
be
a
fraud
it
is
inscribed
with
hebrew
characters
but
the
forger
has
copied
the
modern
instead
of
the
ancient
form
of
the
letters
as
i
have
said
we
as
irritable
here
under
the
oppressions
of
the
anthropologists
as
ever
were
slaves
in
the
south
toward
superiorities
from
poor
white
trash
when
we
finally
reverse
our
relative
positions
we
shall
give
lowest
place
to
the
anthropologists
a
gray
does
at
least
look
at
a
fish
before
he
conceives
of
a
miraculous
origin
for
it
we
shall
have
to
submerge
lord
avebury
far
below
him
if
we
accept
that
the
stone
from
grave
creek
is
generally
regarded
as
a
fraud
by
eminent
authorities
who
did
not
know
it
from
some
other
object
or
in
general
that
so
decided
an
opinion
must
be
the
product
of
either
deliberate
disregard
or
ignorance
or
fatigue
the
stone
belongs
to
a
class
of
phenomena
that
is
repulsive
to
the
system
it
will
not
assimilate
with
the
system
let
such
an
object
be
heard
of
by
such
a
systematist
as
avebury
and
the
mere
mention
of
it
is
as
nearly
certainly
the
stimulus
to
a
conventional
reaction
as
is
a
charged
body
to
an
electroscope
or
a
glass
of
beer
to
a
prohibitionist
it
is
of
the
ideals
of
science
to
know
one
object
from
another
before
expressing
an
opinion
upon
a
thing
but
that
is
not
the
spirit
of
universal
mechanics
a
thing
it
is
attractive
or
repulsive
its
conventional
reaction
follows
because
it
is
not
the
stone
from
grave
creek
that
is
in
hebrew
characters
either
ancient
or
modern
it
is
a
stone
from
newark
ohio
of
which
the
story
is
told
that
a
forger
made
this
mistake
of
using
modern
instead
of
ancient
hebrew
characters
we
shall
see
that
the
inscription
upon
the
grave
creek
stone
is
not
in
hebrew
or
all
things
are
presumed
to
be
innocent
but
are
supposed
to
be
guilty
unless
they
assimilate
whittelsey
reserve
historical
tracts
no
says
that
the
grave
creek
stone
was
considered
a
fraud
by
wilson
squires
and
davis
then
he
comes
to
the
congress
of
archaeologists
at
nancy
france
it
is
hard
for
whittelsey
to
admit
that
at
this
meeting
which
sounds
important
the
stone
was
endorsed
he
reminds
us
of
symons
and
the
man
who
considered
that
he
saw
something
whittelsey
somewhat
tortuous
expression
is
that
the
finder
of
the
stone
so
imposed
his
views
upon
the
congress
that
it
pronounced
the
stone
genuine
also
the
stone
was
examined
by
schoolcraft
he
gave
his
opinion
for
genuineness
or
there
only
one
process
and
is
one
of
its
aspects
three
or
four
fat
experts
on
the
side
against
us
we
find
four
or
five
plump
ones
on
our
side
or
all
that
we
call
logic
and
reasoning
ends
up
as
sheer
preponderance
of
avoirdupois
then
several
philologists
came
out
in
favor
of
genuineness
some
of
them
translated
the
inscription
of
course
as
we
have
said
it
is
our
method
or
the
method
of
orthodoxy
way
in
which
all
conclusions
are
reached
to
have
some
awfully
eminent
or
preponderantly
plump
authorities
with
us
whenever
we
can
in
this
case
however
we
feel
just
a
little
apprehensive
in
being
caught
in
such
excellently
obese
but
somewhat
negativized

i
like

have
such

from

of
someone
polishing
up

something
and
in
an
awful

the

more
dramatic
still
they
all
very

they
are

i
suppose
in
tract
whittelsey
returns
to
the
subject
he
gives
the
conclusion
of
major
de
helward
at
the
congress
of
luxembourg
if
read
and
myself
are
right
in
the
conclusion
that
the
figures
are
neither
of
the
runic
phoenician
canaanite
hebrew
lybian
celtic
or
any
other
its
importance
has
been
greatly
obvious
to
a
child
obvious
to
any
mentality
not
helplessly
subjected
to
a
system
that
just
therein
lies
the
importance
of
this
object
it
is
said
that
an
ideal
of
science
is
to
find
out
the
new
but
unless
a
thing
be
of
the
old
it
is
unimportant
it
is
not
worth
while
hovey
then
the
inscribed
ax
or
wedge
which
according
to
john
evans
in
a
communication
to
the
american
ethnological
society
was
plowed
up
near
pemberton
the
characters
upon
this
ax
or
wedge
are
strikingly
similar
to
the
characters
on
the
grave
creek
stone
also
with
a
little
disregard
here
and
a
little
more
there
they
look
like
tracks
in
the
snow
by
someone
who
been
out
celebrating
or
like
your
handwriting
or
mine
when
we
think
there
a
certain
distinction
in
illegibility
method
of
disregard
anything
anything
abbott
describes
this
object
in
the
of
the
smithsonian
he
says
he
has
no
faith
in
it
all
progress
is
from
the
outrageous
to
the
commonplace
or
proceeds
from
rape
to
the
crooning
of
lullabies
been
interesting
to
me
to
go
over
various
periodicals
and
note
controversies
between
attempting
positivists
and
then
intermediatistic
issues
bold
bad
intruders
of
theories
ruffians
with
dishonorable
intentions
the
alarms
of
science
her
attempts
to
preserve
that
which
is
dearer
than
life
itself
submission
then
a
fidelity
like
micawber
so
many
of
these
ruffians
or
wandering
comedians
that
were
hated
or
scorned
pitied
embraced
conventionalized
there
not
a
notion
in
this
book
that
has
a
more
frightful
or
ridiculous
mien
than
had
the
notion
of
human
footprints
in
rocks
when
that
now
respectabilized
ruffian
or
clown
was
first
heard
from
it
seems
bewildering
to
one
whose
interests
are
not
scientific
that
such
rows
should
be
raised
over
such
trifles
but
the
feeling
of
a
systematist
toward
such
an
intruder
is
just
about
what
anyone
would
be
if
a
tramp
from
the
street
should
come
in
sit
at
one
dinner
table
and
say
he
belonged
there
we
know
what
hypnosis
can
do
let
him
insist
with
all
his
might
that
he
does
belong
there
and
one
begins
to
suspect
that
he
may
be
right
that
he
may
have
higher
perceptions
of
what
right
the
prohibitionists
had
this
worked
out
very
skillfully
so
the
row
that
was
raised
over
the
stone
from
grave
creek
but
time
and
cumulativeness
and
the
very
factor
we
make
so
much
of
or
the
power
of
massed
data
there
were
other
reports
of
inscribed
stones
and
then
half
a
century
later
some
mounds
or
caches
as
we
call
them
were
opened
by
the
rev
gass
near
the
city
of
davenport
several
stone
tablets
were
found
upon
one
of
them
the
letters
tftowns
may
easily
be
made
out
in
this
instance
we
hear
nothing
of
fraudulency
time
cumulativeness
the
power
of
massed
data
the
attempt
to
assimilate
this
datum
is
that
the
tablet
was
probably
of
mormon
origin
why
because
at
mendon
was
found
a
brass
plate
upon
which
were
similar
characters
why
that
because
that
was
found
near
a
house
once
occupied
by
a
mormon
in
a
real
existence
a
real
meteorologist
suspecting
that
cinders
had
come
from
a
fire
engine
would
have
asked
a
fireman
tablets
of
davenport
there
not
a
record
findable
that
it
ever
occurred
to
any
antiquarian
to
ask
a
mormon
other
tablets
were
found
upon
one
of
them
are
two
f
and
two
also
a
large
tablet
twelve
inches
by
eight
to
ten
inches
with
roman
numerals
and
arabic
it
is
said
that
the
figure
occurs
three
times
and
the
figure
or
letter
o
seven
times
with
these
familiar
characters
are
others
that
resemble
ancient
alphabets
either
phoenecian
or
hebrew
it
may
be
that
the
discovery
of
australia
for
instance
will
turn
out
to
be
less
important
than
the
discovery
and
the
meaning
of
these
tablets
but
where
will
you
read
of
them
in
anything
subsequently
published
what
antiquarian
has
ever
since
tried
to
understand
them
and
their
presence
and
indications
of
antiquity
in
a
land
that
we
told
was
inhabited
only
by
unlettered
savages
these
things
that
are
exhumed
only
to
be
buried
in
some
other
way
another
tablet
was
found
at
davenport
by
charles
harrison
president
of
the
american
antiquarian
society
and
other
hieroglyphics
are
upon
this
tablet
this
time
also
fraud
is
not
mentioned
my
own
notion
is
that
it
is
very
unsportsmanlike
ever
to
mention
fraud
accept
anything
then
explain
it
your
way
anything
that
assimilates
with
one
explanation
must
have
assimilable
relations
to
some
degree
with
all
other
explanations
if
all
explanations
are
somewhere
continuous
mormons
are
lugged
in
again
but
the
attempt
is
faint
and
helpless
because
general
circumstances
make
it
difficult
to
explain
the
presence
of
these
tablets
altogether
our
phantom
resistance
is
mere
attribution
to
the
mormons
without
the
slightest
attempt
to
find
base
for
the
attribution
we
think
of
messages
that
were
showered
upon
this
earth
and
of
messages
that
were
cached
in
mounds
upon
this
earth
the
similarity
to
the
franklin
situation
is
striking
conceivably
centuries
from
now
objects
dropped
from
may
be
found
in
the
arctic
and
conceivably
there
are
still
undiscovered
caches
left
by
franklin
in
the
hope
that
relief
expeditions
would
find
them
it
would
be
as
incongruous
to
attribute
these
things
to
the
eskimos
as
to
attribute
tablets
and
lettered
stones
to
the
aborigines
of
america
some
time
i
shall
take
up
an
expression
that
the
mounds
upon
this
earth
were
built
by
explorers
from
somewhere
unable
to
get
back
designed
to
attract
attention
from
some
other
world
and
that
a
vast
mound
has
been
discovered
upon
the
moon
just
now
we
think
of
lettered
things
and
their
two
possible
significances
a
bizarre
little
lost
soul
rescued
from
one
of
the
morgues
of
the
journal
of
an
account
sent
by
a
correspondent
to
silliman
of
something
that
was
found
in
a
block
of
marble
taken
november
from
a
quarry
near
philadelphia
the
block
was
cut
into
slabs
by
this
process
it
is
said
was
exposed
an
indentation
in
the
stone
about
one
and
a
half
inches
by
of
an
inch
a
geometric
indentation
in
it
were
two
raised
letters
like
i
u
only
difference
is
that
the
corners
of
the
u
are
not
rounded
but
are
right
angles
we
are
told
that
this
block
of
stone
came
from
a
depth
of
seventy
or
eighty
feet
or
that
if
acceptable
this
lettering
was
done
long
long
ago
to
some
persons
not
sated
with
the
commonness
of
the
incredible
that
has
to
be
accepted
it
may
seem
grotesque
to
think
that
an
indentation
in
sand
could
have
tons
of
other
sand
piled
upon
it
and
hardening
into
stone
without
being
pressed
out
but
the
famous
nicaraguan
footprints
were
found
in
a
quarry
under
eleven
strata
of
solid
rock
there
was
no
discussion
of
this
datum
we
only
take
it
out
for
an
airing
as
to
lettered
stones
that
may
once
upon
a
time
have
been
showered
upon
europe
if
we
can
not
accept
that
the
stones
were
inscribed
by
indigenous
inhabitants
of
europe
many
have
been
found
in
caves
whence
they
were
carried
as
curiosities
by
prehistoric
men
or
as
ornaments
i
suppose
about
the
size
and
shape
of
the
grave
creek
stone
or
disk
flat
and
oval
and
about
two
inches
wide
sollas
characters
painted
upon
them
found
first
by
piette
in
the
cave
of
mas
ari√©ge
according
to
sollas
they
are
marked
in
various
directions
with
red
and
black
lines
but
on
not
a
few
of
them
more
complex
characters
occur
which
in
a
few
instances
simulate
some
of
the
capital
letters
of
the
roman
alphabet
in
one
instance
the
letters
f
e
i
accompanied
by
no
other
markings
to
modify
them
are
as
plain
as
they
could
be
according
to
sollas
cartailhac
has
confirmed
the
observations
of
piette
and
boule
has
found
additional
examples
they
offer
one
of
the
darkest
problems
of
prehistoric
times
sollas
as
to
caches
in
general
i
should
say
that
they
are
made
with
two
purposes
to
proclaim
and
to
conceal
or
that
caches
documents
are
hidden
or
covered
over
in
conspicuous
structures
at
least
so
are
designed
the
cairns
in
the
arctic
acad
of
that
hooper
bradley
having
come
upon
a
curious
stone
in
some
woods
upon
his
farm
investigated
he
dug
he
unearthed
a
long
wall
upon
this
wall
were
inscribed
many
alphabetic
characters
characters
have
been
examined
many
of
them
duplicates
and
a
few
imitations
of
animal
forms
the
moon
and
other
objects
accidental
imitations
of
oriental
alphabets
are
numerous
the
part
that
seems
significant
that
these
letters
had
been
hidden
under
a
layer
of
cement
and
still
in
our
own
heterogeneity
or
unwillingness
or
inability
to
concentrate
upon
single
concepts
we
shall
or
we
accept
that
though
there
may
have
been
a
lost
colony
or
lost
expedition
from
somewhere
upon
this
earth
and
visitors
who
could
never
get
back
there
have
been
other
visitors
who
have
gone
away
again
altogether
quite
in
analogy
with
the
franklin
expedition
and
peary
flittings
in
the
arctic
and
a
wreck
that
occurred
to
one
group
of
them
and
the
loot
that
was
lost
overboard
the
chinese
seals
of
ireland
not
the
things
with
the
big
wistful
eyes
that
lie
on
ice
and
that
are
taught
to
balance
objects
on
their
noses
but
inscribed
stamps
with
which
to
make
impressions
roy
irish
a
paper
was
read
by
huband
smith
descriptive
of
about
a
dozen
chinese
seals
that
had
been
found
in
ireland
they
are
all
alike
each
a
cube
with
an
animal
seated
upon
it
it
is
said
that
the
inscriptions
upon
them
are
of
a
very
ancient
class
of
chinese
characters
the
three
points
that
have
made
a
leper
and
an
outcast
of
this
datum
but
only
in
the
sense
of
disregard
because
nowhere
that
i
know
of
is
it
questioned
agreement
among
archaeologists
that
there
were
no
relations
in
the
remote
past
between
china
and
ireland
that
no
other
objects
from
ancient
china
virtually
i
suppose
have
ever
been
found
in
ireland
the
great
distances
at
which
these
seals
have
been
found
apart
after
smith
investigations
if
he
did
investigate
or
do
more
than
record
many
more
chinese
seals
were
found
in
ireland
and
with
one
exception
only
in
ireland
in
about
had
been
found
of
all
archaeologic
finds
in
ireland
none
is
enveloped
in
greater
mystery
according
to
the
writer
in
one
of
these
seals
was
found
in
a
curiosity
shop
in
london
when
questioned
the
shopkeeper
said
that
it
had
come
from
ireland
in
this
instance
if
you
do
take
instinctively
to
our
expression
there
is
no
orthodox
explanation
for
your
preference
it
is
the
astonishing
scattering
of
them
over
field
and
forest
that
has
hushed
the
explainers
in
the
of
the
royal
irish
frazer
says
that
they
appear
to
have
been
sown
broadcast
over
the
country
in
some
strange
way
that
i
can
not
offer
solution
of
the
struggle
for
expression
of
a
notion
that
did
not
belong
to
frazer
era
the
invariable
story
of
their
find
is
what
we
might
expect
if
they
had
been
accidentally
dropped
three

in

one
of

seals
was
found
in
the

of

near

were
raising

this
consciousness

to

the
greatest
of
mysteries
why
do
they
ever
come
here
or
send
here
openly
of
course
there
nothing
to
that
mystery
if
we
do
take
so
seriously
the
notion
that
we
must
be
interesting
it
probably
for
moral
reasons
that
they
stay
away
but
even
so
there
must
be
some
degraded
ones
among
them
or
physical
reasons
when
we
can
specially
take
up
that
subject
one
of
our
leading
ideas
or
credulities
will
be
that
near
approach
by
another
world
to
this
world
would
be
catastrophic
that
navigable
worlds
would
avoid
proximity
that
others
that
have
survived
have
organized
into
protective
remotenesses
or
orbits
which
approximate
to
regularity
though
by
no
means
to
the
degree
of
popular
supposition
but
the
persistence
of
the
notion
that
we
must
be
interesting
bugs
and
germs
and
things
like
that
they
interesting
to
us
some
of
them
are
too
interesting
dangers
of
near
approach
nevertheless
our
own
ships
that
dare
not
venture
close
to
a
rocky
shore
can
send
rowboats
ashore
why
not
diplomatic
relations
established
between
the
united
states
and
cyclorea
which
in
our
advanced
astronomy
is
the
name
of
a
remarkable
world
or
why
not
missionaries
sent
here
openly
to
convert
us
from
our
barbarous
prohibitions
and
other
taboos
and
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
good
trade
in
and
fortunes
made
in
selling
us
which
we
take
to
like
an
african
chief
to
someone
old
silk
hat
from
new
york
or
london
the
answer
that
occurs
to
me
is
so
simple
that
it
seems
immediately
acceptable
if
we
accept
that
the
obvious
is
the
solution
of
all
problems
or
if
most
of
our
perplexities
consist
in
laboriously
and
painfully
conceiving
of
the
unanswerable
and
then
looking
for
answers
using
such
words
as
obvious
and
solution
conventionally
or
would
we
if
we
could
educate
and
sophisticate
pigs
geese
cattle
would
it
be
wise
to
establish
diplomatic
relation
with
the
hen
that
now
functions
satisfied
with
mere
sense
of
achievement
by
way
of
compensation
i
think
we
property
i
should
say
we
belong
to
something
that
once
upon
a
time
this
earth
was
land
that
other
worlds
explored
and
colonized
here
and
fought
among
themselves
for
possession
but
that
now
it
owned
by
something
that
something
owns
this
earth
all
others
warned
off
nothing
in
our
own
times
perhaps
because
i
am
thinking
of
certain
notes
i
have
has
ever
appeared
upon
this
earth
from
somewhere
else
so
openly
as
columbus
landed
upon
san
salvador
or
as
hudson
sailed
up
his
river
but
as
to
surreptitious
visits
to
this
earth
in
recent
times
or
as
to
emissaries
perhaps
from
other
worlds
or
voyagers
who
have
shown
every
indication
of
intent
to
evade
and
avoid
we
shall
have
data
as
convincing
as
our
data
of
oil
or
aerial
but
in
this
vast
subject
i
shall
have
to
do
considerable
neglecting
or
disregarding
myself
i
do
see
how
i
can
in
this
book
take
up
at
all
the
subject
of
possible
use
of
humanity
to
some
other
mode
of
existence
or
the
flattering
notion
that
we
can
possibly
be
worth
something
pigs
geese
and
cattle
first
find
out
that
they
are
owned
then
find
out
the
whyness
of
it
i
suspect
that
after
all
we
useful
that
among
contesting
claimants
adjustment
has
occurred
or
that
something
now
has
a
legal
right
to
us
by
force
or
by
having
paid
out
analogues
of
beads
for
us
to
former
more
primitive
owners
of
us
all
others
warned
off
that
all
this
has
been
known
perhaps
for
ages
to
certain
ones
upon
this
earth
a
cult
or
order
members
of
which
function
like
bellwethers
to
the
rest
of
us
or
as
superior
slaves
or
overseers
directing
us
in
accordance
with
instructions
received
from
somewhere
else
in
our
mysterious
usefulness
but
i
accept
that
in
the
past
before
proprietorship
was
established
inhabitants
of
a
host
of
other
worlds
have
dropped
here
hopped
here
wafted
sailed
flown

walked
here
for
all
i
know

pulled
here

have
come

been
unable

peoples
or

and
primitive

or
whatever
they
were
white
ones
black
ones
yellow
ones
i
have
a
very
convincing
datum
that
the
ancient
britons
were
blue
ones
of
course
we
are
told
by
conventional
anthropologists
that
they
only
painted
themselves
blue
but
in
our
own
advanced
anthropology
they
were
veritable
blue
ones
of
note
of
a
blue
child
born
in
england
that
atavism
giants
and
fairies
we
accept
them
of
course
or
if
we
pride
ourselves
upon
being
awfully
i
do
know
how
to
sustain
our
conceit

by
very
largely
going

argues
the
size
of

specially
the

are
strong

that
they

simply
to

something
of
this

is
not
so
impressive
as
to
see
for
one
self
if
anyone
will
take
the
trouble
to
look
up
these
footprints
as
pictured
in
the

will
either
agree
with
marsh
or
feel
that
to
deny
them
is
to
indicate
a
mind
as
profoundly
enslaved
by
a
system
as
was
ever
the
humble
intellect
of
a
medieval
monk
the
reasoning
of
this
representative
phantom
of
the
chosen
or
of
the
spectral
appearances
who
sit
in
judgment
or
condemnation
upon
us
of
the
more
nearly
real
that
there
never
were
giants
upon
this
earth
because
gigantic
footprints
are
more
gigantic
than
prints
made
by
men
who
are
not
giants
we
think
of
giants
as
occasional
visitors
to
this
earth
of
course
stonehenge
for
instance
it
may
be
that
as
time
goes
on
we
shall
have
to
admit
that
there
are
remains
of
many
tremendous
habitations
of
giants
upon
this
earth
and
that
their
appearances
here
were
more
than
casual
but
their
bones
or
the
absence
of
their
bones
except
that
no
matter
how
cheerful
and
unsuspicious
my
disposition
may
be
when
i
go
to
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
dark
cynicisms
arise
the
moment
i
come
to
the
fossils
or
old
bones
that
have
been
found
upon
this
earth
gigantic
things
that
have
been
reconstructed
into
terrifying
but
proper
dinosaurs
but
my
uncheerfulness
the
dodo
did
it
on
one
of
the
floors
below
the
fossils
they
have
a
reconstructed
dodo
it
frankly
a
fiction
it
labeled
as
such

it
been
reconstructed
so
cleverly
and
so
convincingly
fairies
fairy
crosses
that
near
the
point
where
the
blue
ridge
and
the
allegheny
mountains
unite
north
of
patrick
county
virginia
many
little
stone
crosses
have
been
found
a
race
of
tiny
beings
they
crucified
cockroaches
exquisite
beings
but
the
cruelty
of
the
exquisite
in
their
diminutive
way
they
were
human
beings
they
crucified
the
fairy
crosses
we
are
told
in
range
in
weight
from
of
an
ounce
to
an
ounce
but
it
is
said
in
the
that
some
of
them
are
no
larger
than
the
head
of
a
pin
they
have
been
found
in
two
other
states
but
all
in
virginia
are
strictly
localized
on
and
along
bull
mountain
we
are
reminded
of
the
chinese
seals
in
ireland
i
suppose
they
fell
there
some
are
roman
crosses
some
andrew
some
maltese
this
time
we
are
spared
contact
with
the
anthropologists
and
have
geologists
instead
but
i
am
afraid
that
the
relief
to
our
finer
or
more
nearly
real
sensibilities
will
not
be
very
great
the
geologists
were
called
upon
to
explain
the
fairy
crosses
their
response
was
the
usual
scientific
tropism
geologists
say
that
they
are
crystals
the
writer
in
points
out
that
this
hold
up
or
this
an√¶sthetic
if
theoretic
science
be
little
but
attempt
to
assuage
pangs
of
the
unexplained
fails
to
account
for
the
localized
distributions
of
these
objects
which
make
me
think
of
both
aggregation
and
separation
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
if
from
a
wrecked
ship
similar
objects
should
fall
in
large
numbers
but
at
different
times
but
some
are
roman
crosses
some
andrew
some
maltese
conceivably
there
might
be
a
mineral
that
would
have
a
diversity
of
geometric
forms
at
the
same
time
restricted
to
some
expression
of
the
cross
because
snowflakes
for
instance
have
diversity
but
restriction
to
the
hexagon
but
the
guilty
geologists
as
astronomers
and
chemists
and
all
the
other
fishes
though
less
profoundly
of
the
than
the
wretched
anthropologists
disregarded
the
very
datum
that
it
was
wise
to
disregard
that
the
fairy
crosses
are
not
all
made
of
the
same
material
it
the
same
old
disregard
or
it
the
same
old
or
process
of
assimilation
crystals
are
geometric
forms
crystals
are
included
in
the
system
so
then
fairy
crosses
are
crystals
but
that
different
minerals
should
in
a
few
different
regions
be
inspired
to
turn
into
different
forms
of
the
cross
is
the
kind
of
resistance
that
we
call
less
nearly
real
than
our
own
acceptances
we
now
come
to
some
cursed
little
things
that
are
of
the
lost
but
for
the
salvation
of
which
scientific
missionaries
have
done
their
damnedest
pigmy
flints
they
ca
very
well
be
denied
they
lost
and
well
known
pigmy
flints
are
tiny
prehistoric
implements
some
of
them
are
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
size
england
india
france
south
africa
they
been
found
in
many
parts
of
the
world
whether
showered
there
or
not
they
belong
high
up
in
the
froth
of
the
accursed
they
are
not
denied
and
they
have
not
been
disregarded
there
is
an
abundant
literature
upon
this
subject
one
attempt
to
rationalize
them
or
assimilate
them
or
take
them
into
the
scientific
fold
has
been
the
notion
that
they
were
toys
of
prehistoric
children
it
sounds
reasonable
but
of
course
by
the
reasonable
we
mean
that
for
which
the
equally
reasonable
but
opposing
has
not
been
found
out
except
that
we
modify
that
by
saying
that
though
nothing
finally
reasonable
some
phenomena
have
higher
approximations
to
reasonableness
than
have
others
against
the
notion
of
toys
the
higher
approximation
is
that
where
pygmy
flints
are
found
all
flints
are
pygmies
at
least
so
in
india
where
when
larger
implements
have
been
found
in
the
same
place
there
are
separations
by
strata
wilson
the
datum
that
just
at
present
leads
me
to
accept
that
these
flints
were
made
by
beings
about
the
size
of
pickles
is
a
point
brought
out
by
wilson
national
not
only
that
the
flints
are
tiny
but
that
the
chipping
upon
them
is
minute
struggle
for
expression
in
the
mind
of
a
of
an
idea
that
did
not
belong
to
his
era
in
galty
says
so
fine
is
the
chipping
that
to
see
the
workmanship
a
magnifying
glass
is
necessary
i
think
that
would
be
absolutely
convincing
if
there
were
anything
absolutely
anything
either
that
tiny
beings
from
pickle
to
made
these
things
or
that
ordinary
savages
made
them
under
magnifying
glasses
the
idea
that
we
are
now
going
to
develop
or
perpetrate
is
rather
intensely
of
the
accursed
or
the
advanced
it
a
lost
soul
i
admit
or
boast
but
it
fits
in
or
as
conventional
as
ever
our
own
method
is
the
scientific
method
of
assimilating
it
assimilates
if
we
think
of
the
inhabitants
of
elvera
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
tell
the
name
of
the
giant
world
monstrator
world
about
miles
along
its
major
axis
more
details
to
be
published
later
but
our
coming
inspiration
fits
in
if
we
think
of
the
inhabitants
of
elvera
as
having
only
visited
here
having
in
hordes
as
dense
as
clouds
of
bats
come
here
upon
hunting
excursions
for
mice
i
should
say
for
bees
very
likely
or
most
likely
of
all
or
inevitably
to
convert
the
heathen
here
horrified
with
anyone
who
would
gorge
himself
with
more
than
a
bean
at
a
time
fearful
for
the
souls
of
beings
who
would
guzzle
more
than
a
dewdrop
at
a
time
hordes
of
tiny
missionaries
determined
that
right
should
prevail
determining
right
by
their
own
minutenesses
they
must
have
been
missionaries
only
to
be
is
motion
to
convert
or
assimilate
something
else
the
idea
now
is
that
tiny
creatures
coming
here
from
their
own
little
world
which
may
be
eros
though
i
call
it
elvera
would
flit
from
the
exquisite
to
the
enormous
gulp
of
a
terrestrial
animal
half
a
dozen
of
them
gone
and
soon
digested
one
falls
into
a
brook
torn
away
in
a
mighty
torrent
or
never
anything
but
conventional
we
adopt
from
darwin
the
geological
records
are
incomplete
their
flints
would
survive
but
as
to
their
fragile
bodies
one
might
as
well
search
for
prehistoric
a
little
whirlwind
elverean
carried
away
a
hundred
yards
body
never
found
by
his
companions
they
mourn
for
the
departed
conventional
emotion
to
have
they
mourn
there
have
to
be
a
funeral
there
no
getting
away
from
funerals
so
i
adopt
an
explanation
that
i
take
from
the
anthropologists
burial
in
effigy
perhaps
the
elvereans
would
not
come
to
this
earth
again
until
many
years
later
another
distressing
occurrence
one
little
mausoleum
for
all
burials
in
effigy
london
july
that
early
in
july
some
boys
were
searching
for
rabbits
burrows
in
the
rocky
formation
near
edinburgh
known
as
arthur
seat
in
the
side
of
a
cliff
they
came
upon
some
thin
sheets
of
slate
which
they
pulled
out
little
cave
seventeen
tiny
coffins
three
or
four
inches
long
in
the
coffins
were
miniature
wooden
figures
they
were
dressed
differently
both
in
style
and
material
there
were
two
tiers
of
eight
coffins
each
and
a
third
tier
begun
with
one
coffin
the
extraordinary
datum
which
has
especially
made
mystery
here
that
the
coffins
had
been
deposited
singly
in
the
little
cave
and
at
intervals
of
many
years
in
the
first
tier
the
coffins
were
quite
decayed
and
the
wrappings
had
moldered
away
in
the
second
tier
the
effects
of
age
had
not
advanced
so
far
and
the
top
coffin
was
quite
in
the
of
the
society
of
antiquarians
of
there
is
a
full
account
of
this
find
three
of
the
coffins
and
three
of
the
figures
are
pictured
so
elvera
with
its
downy
forests
and
its
microscopic
oyster
shells
and
if
the
elvereans
be
not
very
they
take
baths
with
sponges
the
size
of
pin
heads
or
that
catastrophes
have
occurred
that
fragments
of
elvera
have
fallen
to
this
earth
in
francis
bingham
writing
of
the
corals
and
sponges
and
shells
and
crinoids
that
hahn
had
asserted
that
he
had
found
in
meteorites
says
judging
by
the
photographs
of
them
that
their
notable
peculiarity
is
their
extreme
smallness
the
corals
for
instance
are
about
the
size
of
terrestrial
corals
they
represent
a
veritable
pygmy
animal
world
says
bingham
the
inhabitants
of
monstrator
and
elvera
were
primitives
i
think
at
the
time
of
their
occasional
visits
to
this
earth
though
of
course
in
a
anything
that
we
call
evidence
of
anything
may
be
just
as
good
evidence
of
anything
else
logicians
and
detectives
and
jurymen
and
suspicious
wives
and
members
of
the
royal
astronomic
society
recognize
this
indeterminateness
but
have
the
delusion
that
in
the
method
of
agreement
there
is
final
or
real
evidence
the
method
is
good
enough
for
an
existence
that
is
only
but
also
it
is
the
method
of
reasoning
by
which
witches
were
burned
and
by
which
ghosts
have
been
feared
i
not
like
to
be
so
unadvanced
as
to
deny
witches
and
ghosts
but
i
do
think
that
there
never
have
been
witches
and
ghosts
like
those
of
popular
supposition
but
stories
of
them
have
been
supported
by
astonishing
fabrications
of
details
and
of
different
accounts
in
agreement
so
if
a
giant
left
impressions
of
his
bare
feet
in
the
ground
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
was
a
primitive
bulk
of
culture
out
taking
the
kneipp
cure
so
if
stonehenge
is
a
large
but
only
roughly
geometric
construction
the
inattention
to
details
by
its
builders
signifies
anything
you
please
ambitious
dwarfs
or
giants
if
giants
that
they
were
little
more
than
cave
men
or
that
they
were
architects
from
a
very
civilization
if
there
are
other
worlds
there
are
tutelary
worlds
or
that
kepler
for
instance
could
not
have
been
absolutely
wrong
that
his
notion
of
an
angel
assigned
to
push
along
and
guide
each
planet
may
not
be
very
acceptable
but
that
abstractedly
or
in
the
notion
of
a
tutelary
relation
we
may
find
acceptance
only
to
be
is
to
be
tutelary
our
general
expression
that
everything
in
intermediateness
is
not
a
thing
but
is
an
endeavor
to
become
something
by
breaking
away
from
its
continuity
or
merging
away
with
all
other
phenomena
is
an
attempt
to
break
away
from
the
very
essence
of
a
relative
existence
and
become
absolute
if
it
have
not
surrendered
to
or
become
part
of
some
higher
attempt
that
to
this
process
there
are
two
aspects
attraction
or
the
spirit
of
everything
to
assimilate
all
other
things
if
it
have
not
given
in
and
subordinated
to
or
have
not
been
assimilated
by
some
higher
attempted
system
unity
organization
entity
harmony
equilibrium
and
repulsion
or
the
attempt
of
everything
to
exclude
or
disregard
the
unassimilable
universality
of
the
process
anything
conceivable
a
tree
it
is
doing
all
it
can
to
assimilate
substances
of
the
soil
and
substances
of
the
air
and
sunshine
too
into
obversely
it
is
rejecting
or
excluding
or
disregarding
that
which
it
can
not
assimilate
cow
grazing
pig
rooting
tiger
stalking

trying
or
acting
to

comets
rag

and
the

a

can

sciences
correlating
the
data
they
can
trust
magnates
organizing
chorus
girl
out
for
a
little
late
supper
all
of
them
stopped
somewhere
by
the
unassimilable
chorus
girl
and
the
broiled
lobster
if
she
eats
not
shell
and
all
she
represents
universal
failure
to
positivize
also
if
she
does
she
represents
universal
failure
to
positivize
her
ensuing
disorders
will
translate
her
to
the
negative
absolute
or
science
and
some
of
our
cursed
data
one
speaks
of
the
tutelarian
as
if
it
were
something
distinct
in
itself
so
one
speaks
of
a
tree
a
saint
a
barrel
of
pork
the
rocky
mountains
one
speaks
of
missionaries
as
if
they
were
positively
different
or
had
identity
of
their
own
or
were
a
species
by
themselves
to
the
intermediatist
everything
that
seems
to
have
identity
is
only
attempted
identity
and
every
species
is
continuous
with
all
other
species
or
that
which
is
called
the
specific
is
only
emphasis
upon
some
aspect
of
the
general
if
there
are
cats
they
only
emphasis
upon
universal
felinity
there
is
nothing
that
does
not
partake
of
that
of
which
the
missionary
or
the
tutelary
is
the
special
every
conversation
is
a
conflict
of
missionaries
each
trying
to
convert
the
other
to
assimilate
or
to
make
the
other
similar
to
himself
if
no
progress
be
made
mutual
repulsion
will
follow
if
other
worlds
have
ever
in
the
past
had
relations
with
this
earth
they
were
attempted
positivizations
to
extend
themselves
by
colonies
upon
this
earth
to
convert
or
assimilate
indigenous
inhabitants
of
this
earth
or
and
their
colonies
here
or
where
the
first
romans
came
from
it
as
good
as
the
romulus
and
remus
story
or
that
despite
modern
reasoning
upon
this
subject
there
was
once
something
that
was
or
tutelary
to
early
orientals
azuria
which
was
tutelary
to
the
early
britons
azuria
whence
came
the
blue
britons
whose
descendants
gradually
diluting
like
blueing
in
a
where
a
faucet
turned
on
have
been
most
emphasized
of
or
assimilators
ever
since
worlds
that
were
once
tutelarian
worlds
before
this
earth
became
sole
property
of
one
of
them
their
attempts
to
convert
or
assimilate
but
then
the
state
that
comes
to
all
things
in
their
unacceptance
by
all
stomachs
of
some
things
rejection
by
all
societies
of
some
units
glaciers
that
sort
over
and
cast
out
stones
repulsion
wrath
of
the
baffled
missionary
there
is
no
other
wrath
all
repulsion
is
reaction
to
the
unassimilable
so
then
the
wrath
of
azuria
because
surrounding
peoples
of
this
earth
would
not
assimilate
with
her
own
colonists
in
the
part
of
the
earth
that
we
now
call
england
i
do
know
that
there
has
ever
been
more
nearly
just
reasonable
or
logical
wrath
in
this
earth
history
if
there
is
no
other
wrath
the
wrath
of
azuria
because
the
other
peoples
of
this
earth
would
not
turn
blue
to
suit
her
history
is
a
department
of
human
delusion
that
interests
us
we
are
able
to
give
a
little
advancement
to
history
in
the
vitrified
forts
of
a
few
parts
of
europe
we
find
data
that
the
humes
and
gibbons
have
disregarded
the
vitrified
forts
surrounding
england
but
not
in
england
the
vitrified
forts
of
scotland
ireland
brittany
and
bohemia
or
that
once
upon
a
time
with
electric
blasts
azuria
tried
to
swipe
this
earth
clear
of
the
peoples
who
resisted
her
the
vast
blue
bulk
of
azuria
appeared
in
the
sky
clouds
turned
green
the
sun
was
formless
and
purple
in
the
vibrations
of
wrath
that
were
emanating
from
azuria
the
whitish
or
yellowish
or
brownish
peoples
of
scotland
ireland
brittany
and
bohemia
fled
to
hilltops
and
built
forts
in
a
real
existence
hilltops
or
easiest
accessibility
to
an
aerial
enemy
would
be
the
last
choice
in
refuges
but
here
in
if
we
accustomed
to
run
to
hilltops
in
times
of
danger
we
run
to
them
just
the
same
even
with
danger
closest
to
hilltops
very
common
in
attempt
to
escape
by
running
closer
to
the
pursuing
they
built
forts
or
already
had
forts
on
hilltops
something
poured
electricity
upon
them
the
stones
of
these
forts
exist
to
this
day
vitrified
or
melted
and
turned
to
glass
the
archaeologists
have
jumped
from
one
conclusion
to
another
like
the
rapid
chamois
we
read
of
a
while
ago
to
account
for
vitrified
forts
always
restricted
by
the
commandment
that
unless
their
conclusions
conformed
to
such
tenets
as
exclusionism
of
the
system
they
would
be
excommunicated
so
archaeologists
in
their
medieval
dread
of
excommunication
have
tried
to
explain
vitrified
forts
in
terms
of
terrestrial
experience
we
find
in
their
insufficiencies
the
same
old
assimilating
of
all
that
could
be
assimilated
and
disregard
for
the
unassimilable
conventionalizing
into
the
explanation
that
vitrified
forts
were
made
by
prehistoric
peoples
who
built
vast
fires
often
remote
from
to
melt
externally
and
to
cement
together
the
stones
of
their
constructions
but
negativeness
always
so
within
itself
a
science
can
never
be
homogeneous
or
unified
or
harmonious
so
miss
russel
in
the
of
the
has
pointed
out
that
it
is
seldom
that
single
stones
to
say
nothing
of
long
walls
of
large
houses
that
are
burned
to
the
ground
are
vitrified
if
we
pay
a
little
attention
to
this
subject
ourselves
before
starting
to
write
upon
it
which
is
one
of
the
ways
of
being
more
nearly
real
than
oppositions
so
far
encountered
by
us
we
find
that
the
stones
of
these
forts
are
vitrified
in
no
reference
to
cementing
them
that
they
are
cemented
here
and
there
in
streaks
as
if
special
blasts
had
struck
or
played
upon
them
then
one
thinks
of
lightning
once
upon
a
time
something
melted
in
streaks
the
stones
of
forts
on
the
tops
of
hills
in
scotland
ireland
brittany
and
bohemia
lightning
selects
the
isolated
and
conspicuous
but
some
of
the
vitrified
forts
are
not
upon
tops
of
hills
some
are
very
inconspicuous
their
walls
too
are
vitrified
in
streaks
something
once
had
effect
similar
to
lightning
upon
forts
mostly
on
hills
in
scotland
ireland
brittany
and
bohemia
but
upon
hills
all
over
the
rest
of
the
world
are
remains
of
forts
that
are
not
vitrified
there
is
only
one
crime
in
the
local
sense
and
that
is
not
to
turn
blue
if
the
gods
are
blue
but
in
the
universal
sense
the
one
crime
is
not
to
turn
the
gods
themselves
green
if
you
green
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
of
phenomena
or
alleged
phenomena
of
psychic
research
or
alleged
research
if
in
there
never
has
been
real
research
but
only
approximations
to
research
that
merge
away
or
that
are
continuous
with
prejudice
and
convenience
it
attributed
to
poltergeists
they
mischievous
spirits
poltergeists
do
not
assimilate
with
our
own
present
which
is
an
attempt
to
correlate
denied
or
disregarded
data
as
phenomena
of
forces
expressed
in
physical
terms
therefore
i
regard
poltergeists
as
evil
or
false
or
discordant
or
absurd
names
that
we
give
to
various
degrees
or
aspects
of
the
unassimilable
or
that
which
resists
attempts
to
organize
harmonize
systematize
or
in
short
to
positivize
names
that
we
give
to
our
recognitions
of
the
negative
state
i
do
care
to
deny
poltergeists
because
i
suspect
that
later
when
we
more
enlightened
or
when
we
widen
the
range
of
our
credulities
or
take
on
more
of
that
increase
of
ignorance
that
is
called
knowledge
poltergeists
may
become
assimilable
then
they
be
as
reasonable
as
trees
by
reasonableness
i
mean
that
which
assimilates
with
a
dominant
force
or
system
or
a
major
body
of
thought
which
is
itself
of
course
hypnosis
and
delusion
developing
however
in
our
acceptance
to
higher
and
higher
approximations
to
realness
the
poltergeists
are
now
evil
or
absurd
to
me
proportionately
to
their
present
unassimilableness
compounded
however
with
the
factor
of
their
possible
future
assimilableness
we
lug
in
the
poltergeists
because
some
of
our
own
data
or
alleged
data
merge
away
indistinguishably
with
data
or
alleged
data

other

make

but
if
the

and
if
we
accept
that
the

could
not

it
never

upward
why
lost
a
good

was
a
story
in
a
new
york
newspaper
of
lightning
or
an
appearance
of
luminosity
in
jamaica
something
had
struck
a
tree
near
the
tree
were
found
some
small
pebbles
it
was
said
that
the
pebbles
had
fallen
from
the
sky
with
the
lightning
but
the
insult
to
orthodoxy
was
that
they
were
not
angular
fragments
such
as
might
have
been
broken
from
a
stony
meteorite
that
they
were
pebbles
in
the
geographical
vagueness
of
a
mainland
the
explanation
up
from
one
place
and
down
in
another
is
always
good
and
is
never
overworked
until
the
instances
are
massed
as
they
are
in
this
book
but
upon
this
occasion
in
the
relatively
small
area
of
jamaica
there
was
no
whirlwind
findable
however
there
in
the
first
place
bobs
up
weather
august
that
the
government
meteorologist
had
investigated
had
reported
that
a
tree
had
been
struck
by
lightning
and
that
small
pebbles
had
been
found
near
the
tree
but
that
similar
pebbles
could
be
found
all
over
jamaica
weather
september
fassig
gives
an
account
of
a
fall
of
hail
that
occurred
in
maryland
june
hailstones
the
size
of
baseballs
not
at
all
uncommon
an
interesting
but
unconfirmed
account
stated
that
small
pebbles
were
found
at
the
center
of
some
of
the
larger
hail
gathered
at
annapolis
the
young
man
who
related
the
story
offered
to
produce
the
pebbles
but
has
not
done
so
a
footnote
since
writing
this
the
author
states
that
he
has
received
some
of
the
pebbles
when
a
young
man
produces
pebbles
that
as
convincing
as
anything
else
i
ever
heard
of
though
no
more
convincing
than
if
having
told
of
ham
sandwiches
falling
from
the
sky
he
should
produce
ham
sandwiches
if
this
reluctance
be
admitted
by
us
we
correlate
it
with
a
datum
reported
by
a
weather
bureau
observer
signifying
that
whether
the
pebbles
had
been
somewhere
aloft
a
long
time
or
not
some
of
the
hailstones
that
fell
with
them
had
been
the
datum
is
that
some
of
these
hailstones
were
composed
of
from
twenty
to
layers
alternately
of
clear
ice
and
in
orthodox
terms
i
argue
that
a
hailstone
falls
from
the
clouds
with
velocity
sufficient
to
warm
it
so
that
it
would
not
take
on
even
one
layer
of
ice
to
put
on
twenty
layers
of
ice
i
conceive
of
something
that
had
not
fallen
at
all
but
had
rolled
somewhere
at
a
leisurely
rate
for
a
long
time
we
now
have
a
commonplace
datum
that
is
familiar
in
two
respects
little
symmetric
objects
of
metal
that
fell
at
orenburg
russia
september
a
second
fall
of
these
objects
at
orenburg
russia
jour
roy
i
now
think
of
the
disk
of
tarbes
but
when
first
i
came
upon
these
data
i
was
impressed
only
with
recurrence
because
the
objects
of
orenburg
were
described
as
crystals
of
pyrites
or
sulphate
of
iron
i
had
no
notion
of
metallic
objects
that
might
have
been
shaped
or
molded
by
means
other
than
crystallization
until
i
came
to
arago
account
of
these
occurrences
here
the
analysis
gives
per
cent
red
oxide
of
iron
and
sulphur
and
loss
by
ignition
per
cent
it
seems
to
me
acceptable
that
iron
with
considerably
less
than
per
cent
sulphur
in
it
is
not
iron
pyrites
then
little
rusty
iron
objects
shaped
by
some
other
means
have
fallen
four
months
apart
at
the
same
place
arago
expresses
astonishment
at
this
phenomenon
of
recurrence
so
familiar
to
us
altogether
i
find
opening
before
us
vistas
of
heresies
to
which
i
for
one
must
shut
my
eyes
i
have
always
been
in
sympathy
with
the
dogmatists
and
exclusionists
that
is
plain
in
our
opening
lines
that
to
seem
to
be
is
falsely
and
arbitrarily
and
dogmatically
to
exclude
it
is
only
that
exclusionists
who
are
good
in
the
nineteenth
century
are
evil
in
the
twentieth
century
constantly
we
feel
a
merging
away
into
infinitude
but
that
this
book
shall
approximate
to
form
or
that
our
data
shall
approximate
to
organization
or
that
we
shall
approximate
to
intelligibility
we
have
to
call
ourselves
back
constantly
from
wandering
off
into
infinitude
the
thing
that
we
do
however
is
to
make
our
own
outline
or
the
difference
between
what
we
include
and
what
we
exclude
vague
the
crux
here
and
the
limit
beyond
which
we
may
not
go
very
much
is
acceptance
that
there
is
a
region
that
we
call
the
sea
not
yet
fully
accepted
but
a
provisional
position
that
has
received
a
great
deal
of
support
but
is
it
a
part
of
this
earth
and
does
it
revolve
with
and
over
this
earth
or
does
it
flatly
overlie
this
earth
not
revolving
with
and
over
this
earth
that
this
earth
does
not
revolve
and
is
not
round
or
roundish
at
all
but
is
continuous
with
the
rest
of
its
system
so
that
if
one
could
break
away
from
the
traditions
of
the
geographers
one
might
walk
and
walk
and
come
to
mars
and
then
find
mars
continuous
with
jupiter
i
suppose
some
day
such
queries
will
sound
absurd
the
thing
will
be
so
obvious
because
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
conceive
of
little
metallic
objects
hanging
precisely
over
a
small
town
in
russia
for
four
months
if
revolving
unattached
with
a
revolving
earth
it
may
be
that
something
aimed
at
that
town
and
then
later
took
another
shot
these
are
speculations
that
seem
to
me
to
be
evil
relatively
to
these
early
years
in
the
twentieth
century
just
now
i
accept
that
this
earth
is
not
round
of
course
that
is
very
but
roundish
or
at
least
that
it
has
what
is
called
form
of
its
own
and
does
revolve
upon
its
axis
and
in
an
orbit
around
the
sun
i
only
accept
these
old
traditional
notions
and
that
above
it
are
regions
of
suspension
that
revolve
with
it
from
which
objects
fall
by
disturbances
of
various
kinds
and
then
later
fall
again
in
the
same
place
weather
may
report
from
the
signal
service
observer
at
bismarck
dakota
that
at
in
the
evening
of
may
sharp
sounds
were
heard
throughout
the
city
caused
by
a
fall
of
flinty
stones
striking
against
windows
fifteen
hours
later
another
fall
of
flinty
stones
occurred
at
bismarck
there
is
no
report
of
stones
having
fallen
anywhere
else
this
is
a
thing
of
the
all
editors
of
scientific
publications
read
the
weather
and
frequently
copy
from
it
the
noise
made
by
the
stones
of
bismarck
rattling
against
those
windows
may
be
in
a
language
that
aviators
will
some
day
interpret
but
it
was
a
noise
entirely
surrounded
by
silences
of
this
thing
there
is
no
mention
findable
by
me
in
any
other
publication
the
size
of
some
hailstones
has
worried
many
meteorologists
but
not
meteorologists
i
know
of
no
more
serene
occupation
than
that
of
writing
though
writing
for
the
of
the
salvation
army
may
be
equally
unadventurous
in
the
drowsy
tranquillity
of
a
we
easily
and
unintelligently
read
of
dust
particles
around
which
icy
rain
forms
hailstones
in
their
fall
then
increasing
by
accretion
but
in
the
meteorological
journals
we
read
often
of
nucleating
hailstones
but
it
the
size
of
the
things
dip
a
marble
in
icy
water
dip
and
dip
and
dip
it
if
you
a
resolute
dipper
you
will
after
a
while
have
an
object
the
size
of
a
baseball
but
i
think
a
thing
could
fall
from
the
moon
in
that
length
of
time
also
the
strata
of
them
the
maryland
hailstones
are
unusual
but
a
dozen
strata
have
often
been
counted
ferrel
gives
an
instance
of
thirteen
strata
such
considerations
led
schwedoff
to
argue
that
some
hailstones
are
not
and
can
not
be
generated
in
this
earth
atmosphere
that
they
come
from
somewhere
else
now
in
a
relative
existence
nothing
can
of
itself
be
either
attractive
or
repulsive
its
effects
are
functions
of
its
associations
or
implications
many
of
our
data
have
been
taken
from
very
conservative
scientific
sources
it
was
not
until
their
discordant
implications
or
irreconcilabilities
with
the
system
were
perceived
that
excommunication
was
pronounced
against
them
schwedoff
paper
was
read
before
the
british
association
of
the
implication
and
the
repulsiveness
of
the
implication
to
the
snug
and
tight
little
exclusionists
of
though
we
hold
out
that
they
were
functioning
well
and
ably
relatively
to
that
there
is
water
oceans
or
lakes
and
ponds
or
rivers
of
it
that
there
is
water
away
from
and
yet
not
from
this
atmosphere
and
gravitation
the
pain
of
it
that
the
snug
little
system
of
would
be
ousted
from
its
reposefulness
a
whole
new
science
to
learn
the
science
of
and
science
is
a
turtle
that
says
that
its
own
shell
encloses
all
things
so
the
members
of
the
british
association
to
some
of
them
schwedoff
ideas
were
like
slaps
on
the
back
of
an
turtle
to
some
of
them
his
heresy
was
like
an
offering
of
meat
raw
and
dripping
to
lambs
some
of
them
bleated
like
lambs
and
some
of
them
turled
like
turtles
we
used
to
crucify
but
now
we
ridicule
or
in
the
loss
of
vigor
of
all
progress
the
spike
has
etherealized
into
the
laugh
sir
william
thomson
ridiculed
the
heresy
with
the
phantomosities
of
his
era
that
all
bodies
such
as
hailstones
if
away
from
this
atmosphere
would
have
to
move
at
planetary
velocity
which
would
be
positively
reasonable
if
the
pronouncements
of
isaac
were
anything
but
articles
of
faith
that
a
hailstone
falling
through
this
atmosphere
with
planetary
velocity
would
perform
times
as
much
work
as
would
raise
an
equal
weight
of
water
one
degree
centigrade
and
therefore
never
fall
as
a
hailstone
at
all
be
more
than
melted
these
turls
and
these
bleats
of
pedantry
though
we
insist
that
relatively
to
these
turls
and
bleats
should
be
regarded
as
respectfully
as
we
regard
rag
dolls
that
keep
infants
occupied
and
noiseless
it
is
the
survival
of
rag
dolls
into
maturity
that
we
object
to
so
these
pious
and
na√Øve
ones
who
believed
that
times
something
could
have
that
is
in
an
exact
and
calculable
resultant
whereas
there
is
in
nothing
that
can
except
by
delusion
and
convenience
be
called
a
unit
in
the
first
place
whose
devotions
to
isaac
required
blind
belief
in
formulas
of
falling
bodies
against
data
that
were
piling
up
in
their
own
time
of
meteorites
milk
warm
ones
admitted
even
by
farrington
and
merrill
at
least
one
icy
meteorite
nowhere
denied
by
the
present
orthodoxy
a
datum
as
accessible
to
thomson
in
as
it
is
now
to
us
because
it
was
an
occurrence
of
beans
and
needles
and
tacks
and
a
magnet
needles
and
tacks
adhere
to
and
systematize
relatively
to
a
magnet
but
if
some
beans
too
be
caught
up
they
are
irreconcilables
to
this
system
and
drop
right
out
of
it
a
member
of
the
salvation
army
may
hear
over
and
over
data
that
seem
so
memorable
to
an
evolutionist
it
seems
remarkable
that
they
do
not
influence
him
one
finds
that
he
can
not
remember
them
it
is
incredible
that
sir
william
thomson
had
never
heard
of
cold
meteorites
it
is
simply
that
he
had
no
power
to
remember
such
irreconcilabilities
and
then
symons
again
symons
was
a
man
who
probably
did
more
for
the
science
of
meteorology
than
did
any
other
man
of
his
time
therefore
he
probably
did
more
to
hold
back
the
science
of
meteorology
than
did
any
other
man
of
his
time
in
symons
says
that
schwedoff
ideas
are
very
droll
i
think
that
even
more
amusing
is
our
own
acceptance
that
not
very
far
above
this
earth
surface
is
a
region
that
will
be
the
subject
of
a
whole
new
science
with
which
we
shall
immortalize
ourselves
in
the
resentments
of
the
schoolboys
of
the
future
pebbles
and
fragments
of
meteors
and
things
from
mars
and
jupiter
and
azuria
wedges
delayed
messages
cannon
balls
bricks
nails
coal
and
coke
and
charcoal
and
offensive
old
cargoes
things
that
coat
in
ice
in
some
regions
and
things
that
get
into
areas
so
warm
that
they
putrefy
or
that
there
are
all
the
climates
of
geography
in
i
shall
have
to
accept
that
floating
in
the
sky
of
this
earth
there
often
are
fields
of
ice
as
extensive
as
those
on
the
arctic
ocean
volumes
of
water
in
which
are
many
fishes
and
frogs
tracts
of
land
covered
with
caterpillars
aviators
of
the
future
they
fly
up
and
up
then
they
get
out
and
walk
the
fishing
good
the
bait
right
there
they
find
messages
from
other
worlds
and
within
three
weeks
there
a
big
trade
worked
up
in
forged
messages
sometime
i
shall
write
a
guide
book
to
the
sea
for
aviators
but
just
at
present
there
would
be
much
call
for
it
we
now
have
more
of
our
expression
upon
hail
as
a
concomitant
or
more
data
of
things
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
with
hail
in
general
the
expression
is
these
things
may
have
been
raised
from
some
other
part
of
the
surface
in
whirlwinds
or
may
not
have
fallen
and
may
have
been
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
but
were
the
hailstones
found
with
them
raised
from
some
other
part
of
the
earth
surface
or
were
the
hailstones
upon
the
ground
in
the
first
place
as
i
said
before
this
expression
is
meaningless
as
to
a
few
instances
it
is
reasonable
to
think
of
some
coincidence
between
the
fall
of
hail
and
the
fall
of
other
things
but
inasmuch
as
there
have
been
a
good
many
instances
we
begin
to
suspect
that
this
is
not
so
much
a
book
we
writing
as
a
sanitarium
for
overworked
coincidences
if
not
conceivably
could
very
large
hailstones
and
lumps
of
ice
form
in
this
earth
atmosphere
and
so
then
had
to
come
from
external
regions
then
other
things
in
or
accompanying
very
large
hailstones
and
lumps
of
ice
came
from
external
regions
which
worries
us
a
little
we
may
be
instantly
translated
to
the
positive
absolute
quotes
a
virginia
newspaper
that
fishes
said
to
have
been
catfishes
a
foot
long
some
of
them
had
fallen
in
at
norfolk
virginia
with
hail
vegetable
d√©bris
not
only
nuclear
but
frozen
upon
the
surfaces
of
large
hailstones
at
toulouse
france
july
science
pour
description
of
a
storm
at
pontiac
canada
july
in
which
it
is
said
that
it
was
not
hailstones
that
fell
but
pieces
of
ice
from
half
an
inch
to
over
two
inches
in
diameter
but
the
most
extraordinary
thing
is
that
a
respectable
farmer
of
undoubted
veracity
says
he
picked
up
a
piece
of
hail
or
ice
in
the
center
of
which
was
a
small
green
frog
storm
at
dubuque
iowa
june
in
which
fell
hailstones
and
pieces
of
ice
weather
june
the
foreman
of
the
novelty
iron
works
of
this
city
states
that
in
two
large
hailstones
melted
by
him
were
found
small
living
frogs
but
the
pieces
of
ice
that
fell
upon
this
occasion
had
a
peculiarity
that
indicates
though
by
as
bizarre
an
indication
as
any
we
had
yet
that
they
had
been
for
a
long
time
motionless
or
floating
somewhere
take
that
up
soon
that
june
fishes
one
of
which
was
ten
inches
long
fell
at
boston
that
eight
days
later
fishes
and
ice
fell
at
derby
in
timb
it
is
said
that
at
derby
the
fishes
had
fallen
in
enormous
numbers
from
half
an
inch
to
two
inches
long
and
some
considerably
larger
in
the
copied
from
the
sheffield
it
is
said
that
one
of
the
fishes
weighed
three
ounces
in
several
accounts
it
is
said
that
with
the
fishes
fell
many
small
frogs
and
pieces
of
ice
we
are
told
that
the
frogs
and
the
fishes
had
been
raised
from
some
other
part
of
the
surface
in
a
whirlwind
no
whirlwind
specified
nothing
said
as
to
what
part
of
the
earth
surface
comes
ice
in
the
month
of
july
interests
us
that
the
ice
is
described
as
in
the
london
july
it
is
said
that
the

against

i

of

have
never

before
there
is
a
silence
upon
the
part
of
scientific
men
that
is
unusual
our
sea
may
not
be
an
unavoidable
conclusion
but
arrival
upon
this
earth
of
ice
from
external
regions
does
seem
to
be
except
that
there
must
be
be
it
ever
so
faint
a
merger
it
is
in
the
notion
that
these
masses
of
ice
are
only
congealed
hailstones
we
have
data
against
this
notion
as
applied
to
all
our
instances
but
the
explanation
has
been
offered
and
it
seems
to
me
may
apply
in
some
instances
in
the
soc
astro
de
it
is
said
of
blocks
of
ice
the
size
of
decanters
that
had
fallen
at
tunis
that
they
were
only
masses
of
congealed
hailstones
london
that
a
block
of
ice
described
as
pure
ice
weighing
pounds
had
been
found
in
the
meadow
of
warner
of
cricklewood
there
had
been
a
storm
the
day
before
as
in
some
of
our
other
instances
no
one
had
seen
this
object
fall
from
the
sky
it
was
found
after
the
storm
that
all
that
can
be
said
about
it
letter
from
capt
blakiston
communicated
by
sabine
to
the
royal
society
roy
soc
that
in
a
thunderstorm
pieces
of
ice
had
fallen
upon
capt
blakiston
vessel
that
it
was
not
hail
it
was
not
hail
but
pieces
of
solid
ice
of
different
dimensions
up
to
the
size
of
half
a
brick
according
to
the
quoted
by
the
edinburgh
philosophical
an
mass
of
ice
fell
at
ord
scotland
august
after
an
extraordinary
peal
of
thunder
it
is
said
that
this
was
homogeneous
ice
except
in
a
small
part
which
looked
like
congealed
hailstones
the
mass
was
about
feet
in
circumference
the
story
as
told
in
the
london
is
that
upon
the
evening
of
the
of
august
after
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
a
mass
of
ice
said
to
have
been
feet
in
circumference
had
fallen
upon
the
estate
of
moffat
of
balvullich
it
is
said
that
this
object
fell
alone
or
without
hailstones
altogether
though
it
is
not
so
strong
for
the
sea
i
think
this
is
one
of
our
best
expressions
upon
external
origins
that
large
blocks
of
ice
could
form
in
the
moisture
of
this
atmosphere
is
about
as
likely
as
that
blocks
of
stone
could
form
in
a
dust
whirl
of
course
if
ice
or
water
comes
to
this
earth
from
external
sources
we
think
of
at
least
minute
organisms
in
it
and
on
with
our
data
to
frogs
fishes
on
to
anything
that
thinkable
coming
from
external
sources
it
of
great
importance
to
us
to
accept
that
large
lumps
of
ice
have
fallen
from
the
sky
but
what
we
desire
most
perhaps
because
of
our
interest
in
its
archaeologic
and
palaeontologic
treasures
is
now
to
be
through
with
tentativeness
and
probation
and
to
take
the
sea
into
full
acceptance
in
our
more
advanced
fold
of
the
chosen
of
this
twentieth
century
in
the
of
the
british
it
is
said
that
at
poorhundur
india
flat
pieces
of
ice
many
of
them
weighing
several
pounds
each
i
suppose
had
fallen
from
the
sky
they
are
described
as
large
vast
fields
of
ice
in
the
regions
or
strata
of
the
sea
when
they
break
up
their
fragments
are
in
our
acceptance
there
are
aerial
that
are
remote
from
this
earth
that
break
up
fragments
grinding
against
one
another
rolling
in
vapor
and
water
of
different
constituency
in
different
regions
forming
slowly
as
stratified
hailstones
but
that
there
are
near
this
earth
that
break
up
into
just
such
flat
pieces
of
ice
as
cover
any
pond
or
river
when
ice
of
a
pond
or
river
is
broken
and
are
sometimes
soon
precipitated
to
the
earth
in
this
familiar
flat
formation
met
a
correspondent
writes
that
at
braemar
july
when
the
sky
was
clear
overhead
and
the
sun
shining
flat
pieces
of
ice
fell
from
somewhere
the
sun
was
shining
but
something
was
going
on
somewhere
thunder
was
heard
until
i
saw
the
reproduction
of
a
photograph
in
the
i
had
supposed
that
these
must
be
say
at
least
ten
or
twenty
miles
away
from
this
earth
and
invisible
to
terrestrial
observers
except
as
the
blurs
that
have
so
often
been
reported
by
astronomers
and
meteorologists
the
photograph
published
by
the
is
of
an
aggregation
supposed
to
be
clouds
presumably
not
very
high
so
clearly
detailed
are
they
the
writer
says
that
they
looked
to
him
like
a
field
of
broken
ice
beneath
is
a
picture
of
a
conventional
field
of
ice
floating
ordinarily
in
water
the
resemblance
between
the
two
pictures
is
striking
nevertheless
it
seems
to
me
incredible
that
the
first
of
the
photographs
could
be
of
an
aerial
or
that
gravitation
could
cease
to
act
at
only
a
mile
or
so
from
this
earth
surface
unless
the
exceptional
the
flux
and
vagary
of
all
things
or
that
normally
this
earth
gravitation
extends
say
ten
or
fifteen
miles
outward
but
that
gravitation
must
be
rhythmic
of
course
in
the
of
astronomers
gravitation
as
a
fixed
quantity
is
essential
accept
that
gravitation
is
a
variable
force
and
astronomers
deflate
with
a
perceptible
hissing
sound
into
the
punctured
condition
of
economists
biologists
meteorologists
and
all
the
others
of
the
humbler
divinities
who
can
admittedly
offer
only
insecure
approximations
we
refer
all
who
would
not
like
to
hear
the
hiss
of
escaping
arrogance
to
herbert
spencer
chapters
upon
the
rhythm
of
all
phenomena
if
everything
else
light
from
the
stars
heat
from
the
sun
the
winds
and
the
tides
forms
and
colors
and
sizes
of
animals
demands
and
supplies
and
prices
political
opinions
and
chemic
reactions
and
religious
doctrines
and
magnetic
intensities
and
the
ticking
of
clocks
and
arrival
and
departure
of
the
seasons
if
everything
else
is
variable
we
accept
that
the
notion
of
gravitation
as
fixed
and
formulable
is
only
another
attempted
positivism
doomed
like
all
other
illusions
of
realness
in
so
it
is
intermediatism
to
accept
that
though
gravitation
may
approximate
higher
to
invariability
than
do
the
winds
for
instance
it
must
be
somewhere
between
the
absolutes
of
stability
and
instability
here
then
we
are
not
much
impressed
with
the
opposition
of
physicists
and
astronomers
fearing
a
little
mournfully
that
their
language
is
of
expiring
sibilations
so
then
the
fields
of
ice
in
the
sky
and
that
though
usually
so
far
away
as
to
be
mere
blurs
at
times
they
come
close
enough
to
be
seen
in
detail
for
description
of
what
i
call
a
blur
see
sci
february
sky
in
general
unusually
clear
but
near
the
sun
a
white
slightly
curdled
haze
which
was
dazzlingly
bright
we
accept
that
sometimes
fields
of
ice
pass
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
that
many
strata
of
ice
or
very
thick
fields
of
ice
or
superimposed
fields
would
obscure
the
sun
that
there
have
been
occasions
when
the
sun
was
eclipsed
by
fields
of
ice

that
a
profound
darkness
came
upon
the
city
of

there
fell

of

to
have
fallen
april
in

are
outlined
but
pieces
of
ice
that
fell
at
manassas
virginia
they
look
as
much
like
the
roughly
broken
fragments
of
a
smooth
sheet
of
ice
as
ever
have
roughly
broken
fragments
of
a
smooth
sheet
of
ice
looked
about
two
inches
across
and
one
inch
thick
in
it
is
said
that
at
rouen
july
fell
pieces
of
ice
about
the
size
of
a
hand
described
as
looking
as
if
all
had
been
broken
from
one
enormous
block
of
ice
that
i
think
was
an
aerial
iceberg
in
the
awful
density
or
almost
absolute
stupidity
of
the
century
it
never
occurred
to
anybody
to
look
for
traces
of
polar
bears
or
of
seals
upon
these
fragments
of
course
seeing
what
we
want
to
see
having
been
able
to
gather
these
data
only
because
they
are
in
agreement
with
notions
formed
in
advance
we
are
not
so
respectful
to
our
own
notions
as
to
a
similar
impression
forced
upon
an
observer
who
had
no
theory
or
acceptance
to
support
in
general
our
prejudices
see
and
our
prejudices
investigate
but
this
should
not
be
taken
as
an
absolute
weather
july
that
from
the
weather
bureau
of
portland
oregon
a
tornado
of
june
was
reported
fragments
of
ice
fell
from
the
sky
they
averaged
three
to
four
inches
square
and
about
an
inch
thick
in
length
and
breadth
they
had
the
smooth
surfaces
required
by
our
acceptance
and
according
to
the
writer
in
the
gave
the
impression
of
a
vast
field
of
ice
suspended
in
the
atmosphere
and
suddenly
broken
into
fragments
about
the
size
of
the
palm
of
the
hand
this
datum
profoundly
of
what
we
used
to
call
the
damned
or
before
we
could
no
longer
accept
judgment
or
cut
and
dried
condemnation
by
infants
turtles
and
lambs
was
copied
but
without
comment
in
the
our
theology
is
something
like
this
of
course
we
ought
to
be
damned
but
we
revolt
against
adjudication
by
infants
turtles
and
lambs
we
now
come
to
some
remarkable
data
in
a
rather
difficult
department
of
vast
fields
of
aerial
ice
there
a
lesson
to
me
in
the
treachery
of
the
imaginable
most
of
our
opposition
is
in
the
clearness
with
which
the
conventional
but
impossible
becomes
the
imaginable
and
then
the
resistant
to
modifications
after
it
had
become
the
conventional
with
me
i
conceived
clearly
of
vast
sheets
of
ice
a
few
miles
above
this
earth
then
the
shining
of
the
sun
and
the
ice
partly
melting
that
note
upon
the
ice
that
fell
at
derby
water
trickling
and
forming
icicles
upon
the
lower
surface
of
the
ice
sheet
i
seemed
to
look
up
and
so
clearly
visualized
those
icicles
hanging
like
stalactites
from
a
cave
in
white
calcite
or
i
looked
up
at
the
under
side
of
an
aerial
and
seemed
to
see
a
papillation
similar
to
that
observed
by
a
calf
at
times
but
then
but
then
if
icicles
should
form
upon
the
under
side
of
a
sheet
of
aerial
ice
that
would
be
by
the
falling
of
water
toward
this
earth
an
icicle
is
of
course
an
expression
of
gravitation
and
if
water
melting
from
ice
should
fall
toward
this
earth
why
not
the
ice
itself
fall
before
an
icicle
could
have
time
to
form
of
course
in
where
everything
is
a
paradox
one
might
argue
that
the
water
falls
but
the
ice
does
not
because
the
ice
is
heavier
that
is
in
masses
that
notion
i
think
belongs
in
a
more
advanced
course
than
we
are
taking
at
present
our
expression
upon
icicles
a
vast
field
of
aerial
ice
it
is
inert
to
this
earth
gravitation
but
by
universal
flux
and
variation
part
of
it
sags
closer
to
this
earth
and
is
susceptible
to
gravitation
by
cohesion
with
the
main
mass
this
part
does
not
fall
but
water
melting
from
it
does
fall
and
forms
icicles
then
by
various
disturbances
this
part
sometimes
falls
in
fragments
that
are
protrusive
with
icicles
of
the
ice
that
fell
some
of
it
enclosing
living
frogs
at
dubuque
iowa
june
it
is
said
weather
june
that
there
were
pieces
from
one
to
seventeen
inches
in
circumference
the
largest
weighing
one
pound
and
that
upon
some
of
them
were
icicles
half
an
inch
in
length
we
emphasize
that
these
objects
were
not
hailstones
the
only
merger
is
that
of
knobby
hailstones
or
of
large
hailstones
with
protuberances
wrought
by
crystallization
but
that
is
no
merger
with
terrestrial
phenomena
and
such
formations
are
unaccountable
to
orthodoxy
or
it
is
incredible
that
hail
could
so
crystallize
not
forming
by
accretion
in
the
fall
of
a
few
seconds
for
an
account
of
such
hailstones
see
note
the
size
some
of
them
the
size
of
turkeys
eggs
it
is
our
expression
that
sometimes
the
icicles
themselves
have
fallen
as
if
by
concussion
or
as
if
something
had
swept
against
the
under
side
of
an
aerial
ice
floe
detaching
its
papillations
weather
june
that
at
oswego
june
according
to
the
turin
there
fell
in
a
thunderstorm
pieces
of
ice
that
resembled
the
fragments
of
icicles
weather
that
on
florence
island
lawrence
river
with
ordinary
hail
fell
pieces
of
ice
formed
like
icicles
the
size
and
shape
of
lead
pencils
that
had
been
cut
into
sections
about
of
an
inch
in
length
so
our
data
of
the
sea
and
its
arctic
region
and
for
weeks
at
a
time
an
ice
field
may
hang
motionless
over
a
part
of
this
earth
surface
the
sun
has
some
effect
upon
it
but
not
much
until
late
in
the
afternoon
i
should
say
part
of
it
has
sagged
but
is
held
up
by
cohesion
with
the
main
mass
whereupon
we
have
such
an
occurrence
as
would
have
been
a
little
uncanny
to
us
once
upon
a
time
or
fall
of
water
from
a
cloudless
sky
day
after
day
in
one
small
part
of
this
earth
surface
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
rays
had
had
time
for
their
effects
weather
october
that
according
to
the
charlotte
for
three
weeks
there
had
been
a
fall
of
water
from
the
sky
in
charlotte
localized
in
one
particular
spot
every
afternoon
about
three
that
whether
the
sky
was
cloudy
or
cloudless
the
water
or
rain
fell
upon
a
small
patch
of
land
between
two
trees
and
nowhere
else
this
is
the
newspaper
account
and
as
such
it
seems
in
the
depths
of
the
unchosen
either
by
me
or
any
other
expression
of
the
salvation
army
the
account
by
the
signal
service
observer
at
charlotte
published
in
the
follows
an
unusual
phenomenon
was
witnessed
on
the
having
been
informed
that
for
some
weeks
prior
to
date
rain
had
been
falling
daily
after
on
a
particular
spot
near
two
trees
corner
of
and
d
streets
i
visited
the
place
and
saw
precipitation
in
the
form
of
rain
drops
at
and
while
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
on
the
i
again
visited
the
place
and
from
to
a
light
shower
of
rain
fell
from
a
cloudless
sky
sometimes
the
precipitation
falls
over
an
area
of
half
an
acre
but
always
appears
to
center
at
these
two
trees
and
when
lightest
occurs
there
only
we
see
conventionally
it
is
not
only
that
we
think
and
act
and
speak
and
dress
alike
because
of
our
surrender
to
social
attempt
at
entity
in
which
we
are
only
we
see
what
it
is
proper
that
we
should
see
it
is
orthodox
enough
to
say
that
a
horse
is
not
a
horse
to
an
infant
any
more
than
is
an
orange
an
orange
to
the
unsophisticated
it
interesting
to
walk
along
a
street
sometimes
and
look
at
things
and
wonder
what
they
look
like
if
we
had
been
taught
to
see
horses
and
trees
and
houses
as
horses
and
trees
and
houses
i
think
that
to
they
are
local
stresses
merging
indistinguishably
into
one
another
in
an
nexus
i
think
that
it
would
be
credible
enough
to
say
that
many
times
have
monstrator
and
elvera
and
azuria
crossed
telescopic
fields
of
vision
and
were
not
even
seen
because
it
would
be
proper
to
see
them
it
would
be
respectable
and
it
would
be
respectful
it
would
be
insulting
to
old
bones
to
see
them
it
would
bring
on
evil
influences
from
the
relics
of
isaac
to
see
them
but
our
data
of
vast
worlds
that
are
orbitless
or
that
are
navigable
or
that
are
adrift
in
tides
and
currents
the
data
that
we
shall
have
of
their
approach
in
modern
times
within
five
or
six
miles
of
this
earth
but
then
their
visits
or
approaches
to
other
planets
or
to
other
of
the
few
regularized
bodies
that
have
surrendered
to
the
attempted
entity
of
this
solar
system
as
a
whole
the
question
that
we
ca
very
well
evade
have
these
other
worlds
or
ever
been
seen
by
astronomers
i
think
there
would
not
be
much
approximation
to
realness
in
taking
refuge
in
the
notion
of
astronomers
who
stare
and
squint
and
see
only
that
which
it
is
respectable
and
respectful
to
see
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
astronomers
are
hypnotics
and
that
an
astronomer
looking
at
the
moon
is
hypnotized
by
the
moon
but
our
acceptance
is
that
the
bodies
of
this
present
expression
often
visit
the
moon
or
cross
it
or
are
held
in
temporary
suspension
near
it
then
some
of
them
must
often
have
been
within
the
diameter
of
an
astronomer
hypnosis
our
general
expression
that
upon
the
oceans
of
this
earth
there
are
regularized
vessels
but
also
that
there
are
tramp
vessels
that
upon
the
there
are
regularized
planets
but
also
that
there
are
tramp
worlds
that
astronomers
are
like
mercantile
purists
who
would
deny
commercial
vagabondage
our
acceptance
is
that
vast
celestial
vagabonds
have
been
excluded
by
astronomers
primarily
because
their
irresponsibilities
are
an
affront
to
the
pure
and
the
precise
or
to
attempted
positivism
and
secondarily
because
they
have
not
been
seen
so
very
often
the
planets
steadily
reflect
the
light
of
the
sun
upon
this
uniformity
a
system
that
we
call
primary
astronomy
has
been
built
up
but
now
the
of
advanced
astronomy
is
data
of
celestial
phenomena
that
are
sometimes
light
and
sometimes
dark
varying
like
some
of
the
satellites
of
jupiter
but
with
a
wider
range
however
light
or
dark
they
have
been
seen
and
reported
so
often
that
the
only
important
reason
for
their
exclusion
is
that
they
do
fit
in
with
dark
bodies
that
are
probably
external
to
our
own
solar
system
i
have
in
the
provincialism
that
no
one
can
escape
not
much
concern
dark
bodies
afloat
in
outer
space
would
have
been
damned
a
few
years
ago
but
now
they
sanctioned
by
barnard
and
if
he
says
they
all
right
you
may
think
of
them
without
the
fear
of
doing
something
wrong
or
ridiculous
the
close
kinship
we
note
so
often
between
the
evil
and
the
absurd
i
suppose
by
the
ridiculous
i
mean
the
froth
of
evil
the
dark
companion
of
algol
for
instance
though
a
clear
case
of
celestial
miscegenation
the
purists
or
positivists
admit
that
so
in
the
of
the
national
academy
of
barnard
writes
of
an
object
he
calls
it
an
object
in
cephus
his
idea
is
that
there
are
dark
opaque
bodies
outside
this
solar
system
but
in
the
he
modifies
into
regarding
them
as
dark
nebul√¶
that
not
so
interesting
we
accept
that
venus
for
instance
has
often
been
visited
by
other
worlds
or
by
from
which
come
ciders
and
coke
and
coal
that
sometimes
these
things
have
reflected
light
and
have
been
seen
from
this
earth
by
professional
astronomers
it
will
be
noted
that
throughout
this
chapter
our
data
are
accursed
brahmins
as
by
hypnosis
and
inertia
we
keep
on
and
keep
on
saying
just
as
a
good
many
of
the
scientists
of
the
century
kept
on
and
kept
on
admitting
the
power
of
the
system
that
preceded
them
or
continuity
would
be
smashed
there
a
big
chance
here
for
us
to
be
instantaneously
translated
to
the
positive
absolute
oh
well
what
i
emphasize
here
is
that
our
damned
data
are
observations
by
astronomers
of
the
highest
standing
excommunicated
by
astronomers
of
similar
standing
but
backed
up
by
the
dominant
spirit
of
their
era
to
which
all
minds
had
to
equilibrate
or
be
negligible
unheard
submerged
it
would
seem
sometimes
in
this
book
as
if
our
revolts
were
against
the
dogmatisms
and
pontifications
of
single
scientists
of
eminence
this
is
only
a
convenience
because
it
seems
necessary
to
personify
if
we
look
over
or
the
publications
of
the
royal
astronomical
society
for
instance
we
see
that
herschel
for
instance
was
as
powerless
as
any
boy
stargazer
to
enforce
acceptance
of
any
observation
of
his
that
did
not
harmonize
with
the
system
that
was
growing
up
as
independently
of
him
and
all
other
astronomers
as
a
phase
in
the
development
of
an
embryo
compels
all
cells
to
take
on
appearances
concordantly
with
the
design
and
the
predetermined
progress
and
schedule
of
the
whole
visitors
to
venus
evans
of
the
that
in
a
body
large
enough
to
look
like
a
satellite
was
seen
near
venus
four
times
in
the
first
half
of
the
century
a
similar
observation
was
reported
the
last
report
occurred
in
a
large
body
has
been
seen
seven
times
according
to
near
venus
at
least
one
astronomer
houzeau
accepted
these
observations
and
named
the
world
planet
neith
his
views
are
mentioned
in
passing
but
without
endorsement
in
the
houzeau
or
someone
writing
for
the
of
a
sunday
newspaper
outer
darkness
for
both
alike
a
new
satellite
in
this
solar
system
might
be
a
little
disturbing
though
the
formulas
of
laplace
which
were
considered
final
in
his
day
have
survived
the
admittance
of
five
or
six
hundred
bodies
not
included
in
those
formulas
a
satellite
to
venus
might
be
a
little
disturbing
but
would
be
explained
but
a
large
body
approaching
a
planet
staying
awhile
going
away
coming
back
some
other
time
anchoring
as
it
were
azuria
is
pretty
bad
but
azuria
is
no
worse
than
neith
a
body
or
a
bright
spot
near
mars
seen
by
pickering
and
others
at
the
lowell
observatory
above
an
unilluminated
part
of
mars
it
would
seem
thought
to
have
been
a
cloud
but
estimated
to
have
been
about
twenty
miles
away
from
the
planet
luminous
spot
seen
moving
across
the
disk
of
mercury
in
by
harding
and
schroeter
notices
of

the
first
bulletin
issued
by
the
lowell
observatory
in

a
body
that
was
seen
on
the
terminator
of

may
on
may
it
was
suspected
if
still
there
it
had
moved
we
are
told
about
miles
probably
a

very
conspicuous
and
brilliant

seen
on

october
and
november
vol
no
so
one
of
them
accepted
six
or
seven
observations
that
were
in
agreement
except
that
they
could
not
be
regularized
upon
a
world
planet
satellite
and
he
gave
it
a
name
he
named
it
neith
monstrator
and
elvera
and
azuria
and
or
heresy
and
orthodoxy
and
the
oneness
of
all
quasiness
and
our
ways
and
means
and
methods
are
the
very
same
or
if
we
name
things
that
may
not
be
we
are
not
of
lonely
guilt
in
the
nomenclature
of
absences
but
now
leverrier
and
vulcan
leverrier
again
or
to
demonstrate
the
collapsibility
of
a
froth
stick
a
pin
in
the
largest
bubble
of
it
astronomy
and
inflation
and
by
inflation
we
mean
expansion
of
the
attenuated
or
that
the
science
of
astronomy
is
a
distended
with
but
always
our
acceptance
that
it
approximates
higher
to
substantiality
than
did
the
system
that
preceded
it
so
leverrier
and
the
planet
vulcan
and
we
repeat
and
it
will
do
us
small
good
to
repeat
if
you
be
of
the
masses
that
the
astronomers
have
hypnotized
being
themselves
hypnotized
or
they
could
not
hypnotize
others
or
that
the
control
is
not
the
masterful
power
that
it
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
but
only
transference
of
state
from
one
hypnotic
to
another
if
you
be
of
the
masses
that
the
astronomers
have
hypnotized
you
will
not
be
able
even
to
remember
ten
pages
from
here
and
leverrier
and
the
planet
vulcan
will
have
fallen
from
your
mind
like
beans
from
a
magnet
or
like
data
of
cold
meteorites
from
the
mind
of
a
thomson
leverrier
and
the
planet
vulcan
and
much
the
good
it
will
do
us
to
repeat
but
at
least
temporarily
we
shall
have
an
impression
of
a
historic
fiasco
such
as
in
our
acceptance
could
occur
only
in
a
in
lescarbault
an
amateur
astronomer
of
org√®res
france
announced
that
upon
march
of
that
year
he
had
seen
a
body
of
planetary
size
cross
the
sun
we
are
in
a
subject
that
is
now
as
unholy
to
the
present
system
as
ever
were
its
own
subjects
to
the
system
that
preceded
it
or
as
ever
were
slanders
against
miracles
to
the
preceding
system
nevertheless
few
go
so
far
as
quite
to
disregard
this
tragedy
the
method
of
the
systematists
is
slightingly
to
give
a
few
instances
of
the
unholy
and
dispose
of
the
few
if
it
were
desirable
to
them
to
deny
that
there
are
mountains
upon
this
earth
they
would
record
a
few
observations
upon
some
slight
eminences
near
orange
but
say
that
commuters
though
estimable
persons
in
several
ways
are
likely
to
have
their
observations
mixed
the
casually
mention
a
few
of
the
supposed
observations
upon
vulcan
and
then
pass
on
lescarbault
wrote
to
leverrier
who
hastened
to
org√®res
because
this
announcement
assimilated
with
his
own
calculations
upon
a
planet
between
mercury
and
the
sun
because
this
solar
system
itself
has
never
attained
positiveness
in
the
aspect
of
regularity
there
are
to
mercury
as
there
are
to
neptune
phenomena
irreconcilable
with
the
formulas
or
motions
that
betray
influence
by
something
else
we
are
told
that
leverrier
satisfied
himself
as
to
the
substantial
accuracy
of
the
reported
observation
the
story
of
this
investigation
is
told
in
it
seems
too
bad
to
threaten
the
na√Øve
little
thing
with
our
rude
sophistications
but
it
is
amusingly
of
the
ingenuousness
of
the
age
from
which
present
dogmas
have
survived
lescarbault
wrote
to
leverrier
leverrier
hastened
to
org√®res
but
he
was
careful
not
to
tell
lescarbault
who
he
was
went
right
in
and
subjected
lescarbault
to
a
very
severe
just
the
way
you
or
i
may
feel
at
liberty
to
go
into
anybody
home
and
be
severe
with
people
pressing
him
hard
step
by
step
just
as
anyone
might
go
into
someone
else
house
and
press
him
hard
though
unknown
to
the
one
not
until
he
was
satisfied
did
leverrier
reveal
his
identity
i
suppose
lescarbault
expressed
astonishment
i
think
there
something
utopian
about
this
it
so
unlike
the
of
new
york
life
leverrier
gave
the
name
vulcan
to
the
object
that
lescarbault
had
reported
by
the
same
means
by
which
he
is
even
to
this
day
supposed
by
the
faithful
to
have
discovered
neptune
he
had
already
announced
the
probable
existence
of
an
body
or
group
of
bodies
he
had
five
observations
besides
lescarbault
upon
something
that
had
been
seen
to
cross
the
sun
in
accordance
with
the
mathematical
hypnoses
of
his
era
he
studied
these
six
transits
out
of
them
he
computed
elements
giving
vulcan
a
period
of
about
days
or
a
formula
for
heliocentric
longitude
at
any
time
but
he
placed
the
time
of
best
observation
away
up
in
but
even
so
or
considering
that
he
still
had
probably
a
good
many
years
to
live
it
may
strike
one
that
he
was
a
little
rash
that
is
if
one
has
not
gone
very
deep
into
the
study
of
hypnoses
that
having
discovered
neptune
by
a
method
which
in
our
acceptance
had
no
more
to
recommend
it
than
had
once
equally
methods
of
he
should
not
have
taken
such
chances
that
if
he
was
right
as
to
neptune
but
should
be
wrong
as
to
vulcan
his
average
would
be
away
below
that
of
most
who
could
scarcely
hope
to
do
business
upon
a
fifty
per
cent
basis
all
that
the
reasoning
of
a
tyro
in
hypnoses
the
date
march
the
scientific
world
was
up
on
its
hind
legs
nosing
the
sky
the
thing
had
been
done
so
authoritatively
never
a
pope
had
said
a
thing
with
more
of
the
seeming
of
finality
if
six
observations
correlated
what
more
could
be
asked
the
editor
of
a
week
before
the
predicted
event
though
cautious
said
that
it
is
difficult
to
explain
how
six
observers
unknown
to
one
another
could
have
data
that
could
be
formulated
if
they
were
not
related
phenomena
in
a
way
at
this
point
occurs
the
crisis
of
our
whole
book
formulas
are
against
us
but
can
astronomic
formulas
backed
up
by
observations
in
agreement
taken
many
years
apart
calculated
by
a
leverrier
be
as
meaningless
in
a
positive
sense
as
all
other
that
we
have
encountered
so
far
the
preparations
they
made
before
march
in
england
the
astronomer
royal
made
it
the
expectation
of
his
life
notified
observers
at
madras
melbourne
sydney
and
new
zealand
and
arranged
with
observers
in
chili
and
the
united
states
struve
had
prepared
for
observations
in
siberia
and
japan
march
not
absolutely
hypocritically
i
think
it
pathetic
myself
if
anyone
should
doubt
the
sincerity
of
leverrier
in
this
matter
we
note
whether
it
has
meaning
or
not
that
a
few
months
later
he
died
i
think
we
take
up
monstrator
though
there
so
much
to
this
subject
that
we
have
to
come
back
according
to
the
upon
the
of
august
de
rostan
of
basle
france
was
taking
altitudes
of
the
sun
at
lausanne
he
saw
a
vast
body
about
three
of
the
digits
in
breadth
and
nine
in
length
advancing
slowly
across
the
disk
of
the
sun
or
at
no
more
than
half
the
velocity
with
which
the
ordinary
solar
spots
move
it
did
not
disappear
until
the
of
september
when
it
reached
the
sun
limb
because
of
the
form
i
incline
to
think
of
a
but
another
observation
which
seems
to
indicate
that
it
was
a
world
is
that
though
it
was
opaque
and
eclipsed
the
sun
it
had
around
it
a
kind
of
nebulosity
or
atmosphere
a
penumbra
would
ordinarily
be
a
datum
of
a
sun
spot
but
there
are
observations
that
indicate
that
this
object
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
sun
it
is
recorded
that
another
observer
at
paris
watching
the
sun
at
this
time
had
not
seen
this
object
but
that
croste
at
sole
about
german
leagues
northward
from
lausanne
had
seen
it
describing
the
same
but
disagreeing
a
little
as
to
breadth
then
comes
the
important
point
that
he
and
de
rostan
did
not
see
it
upon
the
same
part
of
the
sun
this
then
is
parallax
and
compounded
with
invisibility
at
paris
is
great
parallax
or
that
in
the
course
of
a
month
in
the
summer
of
a
large
opaque
body
traversed
the
disk
of
the
sun
but
at
a
great
distance
from
the
sun
the
writer
in
the
says
in
a
word
we
know
of
nothing
to
have
recourse
to
in
the
heavens
by
which
to
explain
this
phenomenon
i
suppose
he
was
not
a
hopeless
addict
to
explaining
extraordinary
we
fear
he
must
have
been
a
man
of
loose
habits
in
some
other
respects
as
to
us
monstrator
in
the
notices
of
the
february
leverrier
who
never
lost
faith
up
to
the
last
day
gives
the
six
observations
upon
an
unknown
body
of
planetary
size
that
he
had
formulated
fritsche
stark
de
cuppis
sidebotham
lescarbault
march
lummis
march
if
we
were
so
accustomed
to
science
in
its
essential
aspect
of
disregard
we
be
mystified
and
impressed
like
the
editor
of
with
the
formulation
of
these
data
agreement
of
so
many
instances
would
seem
incredible
as
a
coincidence
but
our
acceptance
is
that
with
just
enough
disregard
astronomers
and
can
formulate
anything
or
we
engage
ourselves
to
formulate
periodicities
in
the
crowds
in
broadway
say
that
every
wednesday
morning
a
tall
man
with
one
leg
and
a
black
eye
carrying
a
rubber
plant
passes
the
singer
building
at
quarter
past
ten
of
course
it
could
really
be
done
unless
such
a
man
did
have
such
periodicity
but
if
some
wednesday
mornings
it
should
be
a
small
child
lugging
a
barrel
or
a
fat
negress
with
a
week
wash
by
ordinary
disregard
that
would
be
prediction
good
enough
for
the
kind
of
we
in
so
whether
we
accuse
or
whether
we
think
that
the
word
accuse
an
attitude
toward
a
or
mere
figment
in
a
our
acceptance
is
that
leverrier
never
did
formulate
observations
that
he
picked
out
observations
that
could
be
formulated
that
of
this
type
are
all
formulas
that
if
leverrier
had
not
been
himself
helplessly
hypnotized
or
if
he
had
had
in
him
more
than
a
tincture
of
realness
never
could
he
have
been
beguiled
by
such
a
but
that
he
was
hypnotized
and
so
extended
or
transferred
his
condition
to
others
that
upon
march
he
had
this
earth
bristling
with
telescopes
with
the
rigid
and
almost
inanimate
forms
of
astronomers
behind
them
and
not
a
blessed
thing
of
any
unusuality
was
seen
upon
that
day
or
succeeding
days
but
that
the
science
of
astronomy
suffered
the
slightest
in
prestige
it
could
the
spirit
of
was
behind
it
if
in
an
embryo
some
cells
should
not
live
up
to
the
phenomena
of
their
era
the
others
will
sustain
the
scheduled
appearances
not
until
an
embryo
enters
the
mammalian
stage
are
cells
of
the
reptilian
stage
false
cells
it
is
our
acceptance
that
there
were
many
equally
authentic
reports
upon
large
planetary
bodies
that
had
been
seen
near
the
sun
that
of
many
leverrier
picked
out
six
not
then
deciding
that
all
the
other
observations
related
to
still
other
large
planetary
bodies
but
arbitrarily
or
hypnotically
disregarding
or
heroically
disregarding
every
one
of
them
that
to
formulate
at
all
he
had
to
exclude
falsely
the
d√©nouement
killed
him
i
think
i
not
at
all
inclined
to
place
him
with
the
grays
and
hitchcocks
and
symonses
not
because
though
it
was
rather
unsportsmanlike
to
put
the
date
so
far
ahead
he
did
give
a
date
and
he
did
stick
to
it
with
such
a
high
approximation
i
think
leverrier
was
translated
to
the
positive
absolute
the
disregarded
observation
of
july
by
gruthinson
but
that
was
of
two
bodies
that
crossed
the
sun
together
that
according
to
the
astronomer
hind
benjamin
scott
city
chamberlain
of
london
and
wray
had
in
seen
a
body
similar
to
vulcan
cross
the
sun
similar
observation
by
hind
and
lowe
march
body
of
apparent
size
of
mercury
seen
by
russell
and
four
other
observers
crossing
the
sun
de
vico
observation
of
july
that
another
amateur
astronomer
coumbray
of
constantinople
had
written
to
leverrier
that
upon
the
of
march
he
had
seen
a
black
point
sharply
outlined
traverse
the
disk
of
the
sun
it
detached
itself
from
a
group
of
sun
spots
near
the
limb
of
the
sun
and
took
minutes
to
reach
the
other
limb
figuring
upon
the
diagram
sent
by
coumbray
a
central
passage
would
have
taken
a
little
more
than
an
hour
this
observation
was
disregarded
by
leverrier
because
his
formula
required
about
four
times
that
velocity
the
point
here
is
that
these
other
observations
are
as
authentic
as
those
that
leverrier
included
that
then
upon
data
as
good
as
the
data
of
vulcan
there
must
be
other
vulcans
the
heroic
and
defiant
disregard
then
of
trying
to
formulate
one
omitting
the
others
which
by
orthodox
doctrine
must
have
influenced
it
greatly
if
all
were
in
the
relatively
narrow
space
between
mercury
and
the
sun
observation
upon
another
such
body
of
april
by
weber
of
berlin
as
to
this
observation
leverrier
was
informed
by
wolf
in
august
it
made
no
difference
so
far
as
can
be
known
to
this
notable
positivist
two
other
observations
noted
by
hind
and
denning
london
and
march
notices
of
the
standacher
february
lichtenberg
hoffman
may
dangos
stark
an
observation
by
schmidt
is
said
to
be
doubtful
but
upon
page
it
is
said
that
this
doubt
had
arisen
because
of
a
mistaken
translation
and
two
other
observations
by
schmidt
are
given
and
also
an
observation
by
lofft
observation
by
steinheibel
at
vienna
april
haase
had
collected
reports
of
twenty
observations
like
lescarbault
the
list
was
published
in
by
wolf
also
there
are
other
instances
like
gruthinsen
jour
report
by
pastorff
that
he
had
seen
twice
in
and
once
in
two
round
spots
of
unequal
size
moving
across
the
sun
changing
position
relatively
to
each
other
and
taking
a
different
course
if
not
orbit
each
time
that
in
he
had
seen
similar
bodies
pass
six
times
across
the
disk
of
the
sun
looking
very
much
like
mercury
in
his
transits
march
but
to
point
out
leverrier
average
or
discovering
planets
upon
a
fifty
per
cent
basis
would
be
to
point
out
the
low
percentage
of
realness
in
the
of
which
the
whole
system
is
composed
we
do
not
accuse
the
of
omitting
this
fiasco
but
we
do
note
that
theirs
is
the
conventional
adaptation
here
of
all
beguilers
who
are
in
difficulties
the
diverting
of
attention
it
would
be
possible
in
a
real
existence
with
real
mentality
to
deal
with
but
i
suppose
it
good
enough
for
the
that
stupefy
themselves
with
the
trick
here
is
to
gloss
over
leverrier
mistake
and
blame
lescarbault
he
was
only
an
amateur
had
delusions
the
reader
attention
is
led
against
lescarbault
by
a
report
from
lias
director
of
the
brazilian
coast
survey
who
at
the
time
of
lescarbault
supposed
observation
had
been
watching
the
sun
in
brazil
and
instead
of
seeing
even
ordinary
sun
spots
had
noted
that
the
region
of
the
supposed
transit
was
of
uniform
intensity
but
the
meaninglessness
of
all
utterances
in
uniform
intensity
turns
our
way
as
much
as
against
us
or
some
day
some
brain
will
conceive
a
way
of
beating
newton
third
law
if
every
reaction
or
resistance
is
or
can
be
interpretable
as
stimulus
instead
of
resistance
if
this
could
be
done
in
mechanics
there
a
way
open
here
for
someone
to
own
the
world
specifically
in
this
matter
uniform
intensity
means
that
lescarbault
saw
no
ordinary
sun
spot
just
as
much
as
it
means
that
no
spot
at
all
was
seen
upon
the
sun
continuing
the
interpretation
of
a
resistance
as
an
assistance
which
can
always
be
done
with
mental
forces
making
us
wonder
what
applications
could
be
made
with
steam
and
electric
forces
we
point
out
that
invisibility
in
brazil
means
parallax
quite
as
truly
as
it
means
absence
and
inasmuch
as
vulcan
was
supposed
to
be
distant
from
the
sun
we
interpret
denial
as
corroboration
method
of
course
of
every
scientist
politician
theologian
debater
so
the
with
no
especial
cleverness
because
no
especial
cleverness
is
needed
lead
the
reader
into
contempt
for
the
amateur
of
org√®res
and
forgetfulness
of
leverrier
and
some
other
subject
is
taken
up
but
our
own
acceptance
that
these
data
are
as
good
as
ever
they
were
that
if
someone
of
eminence
should
predict
an
earthquake
and
if
there
should
be
no
earthquake
at
the
predicted
time
that
would
discredit
the
prophet
but
data
of
past
earthquakes
would
remain
as
good
as
ever
they
had
been
it
is
easy
enough
to
smile
at
the
illusion
of
a
single
amateur
the

pastorff
these
are
only
the
observations
conventionally
listed
relatively
to
an
planet
they
are
formidable
enough
to
prevent
our
being
diverted
as
if
it
were
all
the
dream
of
a
lonely
amateur
but
they
a
mere
from
now
on
other
data
of
large
celestial
bodies
some
dark
and
some
reflecting
light
will
pass
and
pass
and
keep
on
passing
so
that
some
of
us
will
remember
a
thing
or
two
after
the
over
possibly
taking
up
only
one
of
the
listed
observations
or
our
impression
that
the
discrediting
of
leverrier
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
acceptability
of
these
data
in
the
london
is
benjamin
scott
account
of
his
observation
that
in
the
summer
of
he
had
seen
a
body
that
had
seemed
to
be
the
size
of
venus
crossing
the
sun
he
says
that
hardly
believing
the
evidence
of
his
sense
of
sight
he
had
looked
for
someone
whose
hopes
or
ambitions
would
not
make
him
so
subject
to
illusion
he
had
told
his
little
son
aged
five
years
to
look
through
the
telescope
the
child
had
exclaimed
that
he
had
seen
a
little
balloon
crossing
the
sun
scott
says
that
he
had
not
had
sufficient
to
make
public
announcement
of
his
remarkable
observation
at
the
time
but
that
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
had
told
dick
who
had
cited
other
instances
in
the
is
published
a
letter
from
richard
abbott
that
he
remembered
scott
letter
to
him
upon
this
observation
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
i
suppose
that
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
one
had
the
notion
that
by
hard
scratching
through
musty
old
records
we
might
rake
up
vague
more
than
doubtful
data
distortable
into
what
called
evidence
of
unrecognized
worlds
or
constructions
of
planetary
size
but
the
high
authenticity
and
the
support
and
the
modernity
of
these
of
the
accursed
that
we
are
now
considering
and
our
acceptance
that
ours
is
a
in
which
above
all
other
things
hopes
ambitions
emotions
motivations
stands
attempt
to
positivize
that
we
are
here
considering
an
attempt
to
systematize
that
is
sheer
fanaticism
in
its
disregard
of
the
unsystematizable
that
it
represented
the
highest
good
in
the
century
that
it
is
but
heroic
that
was
in
the
century
but
that
this
is
the
century
as
a
doubly
sponsored
brahmin
in
the
regard
of
baptists
the
objects
of
july
stand
out
and
proclaim
themselves
so
that
nothing
but
disregard
of
the
intensity
of
can
account
for
their
reception
by
the
system
or
the
total
eclipse
of
july
and
the
reports
by
watson
from
rawlins
wyoming
and
by
prof
swift
from
denver
colorado
that
they
had
seen
two
shining
objects
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
sun
it
quite
in
accord
with
our
general
expression
not
that
there
is
an
planet
but
that
there
are
different
bodies
many
vast
things
near
this
earth
sometimes
near
the
sun
sometimes
orbitless
worlds
which
because
of
scarcely
any
data
of
collisions
we
think
of
as
under
navigable
control
or
dirigible
watson
and
prof
swift
published
their
observations
then
the
disregard
that
we
can
not
think
of
in
terms
of
ordinary
sane
exclusions
the
systematists
begin
by
telling
us
that
the
trouble
with
these
observations
is
that
they
disagree
widely
there
is
considerable
respectfulness
especially
for
prof
swift
but
we
are
told
that
by
coincidence
these
two
astronomers
hundreds
of
miles
apart
were
illuded
their
observations
were
so
different
prof
swift
that
his
own
observation
was
in
close
approximation
to
that
given
by
prof
watson
in
the
swift
says
that
his
observations
and
watson
were
confirmatory
of
each
other
the
faithful
try
again
that
watson
and
swift
mistook
stars
for
other
bodies
in
the
watson
says
that
he
had
previously
committed
to
memory
all
stars
near
the
sun
down
to
the
seventh
magnitude
and
he
damned
anyway
how
such
exclusions
work
out
is
shown
by
lockyer
he
says
there
is
little
doubt
that
an
planet
has
been
discovered
by
prof
watson
that
was
before
excommunication
was
pronounced
he
says
if
it
will
fit
one
of
leverrier
orbits
it
did
fit
in
prof
swift
says
i
have
never
made
a
more
valid
observation
nor
one
more
free
from
doubt
he
damned
anyway
we
shall
have
some
data
that
will
not
live
up
to
most
rigorous
requirements
but
if
anyone
would
like
to
read
how
carefully
and
minutely
these
two
sets
of
observations
were
made
see
prof
detailed
description
in
the
jour
and
the
technicalities
of
watson
observations
in
our
own
acceptance
upon
dirigible
worlds
which
is
assuredly
enough
more
nearly
real
than
attempted
concepts
of
large
planets
relatively
near
this
earth
moving
in
orbits
but
visible
only
occasionally
which
more
nearly
approximates
to
reasonableness
than
does
wholesale
slaughter
of
swift
and
watson
and
fritsche
and
stark
and
de
cuppis
but
our
own
acceptance
is
so
painful
to
so
many
minds
that
in
another
of
the
charitable
moments
that
we
have
now
and
then
for
the
sake
of
contrast
we
offer
relief
the
things
seen
high
in
the
sky
by
swift
and
watson
well
only
two
months
before
the
horse
and
the
barn
we
go
on
with
more
observations
by
astronomers
recognizing
that
it
is
the
very
thing
that
has
given
them
life
sustained
them
held
them
together
that
has
crushed
all
but
the
of
independent
life
out
of
them
were
they
not
systematized
they
could
not
be
at
all
except
sporadically
and
without
sustenance
they
are
systematized
they
must
not
vary
from
the
conditions
of
the
system
they
must
not
break
away
for
themselves
the
two
great
commandments
thou
shalt
not
break
continuity
thou
shalt
try
we
go
on
with
these
disregarded
data
some
of
which
many
of
which
are
of
the
highest
degree
of
acceptability
it
is
the
system
that
pulls
back
its
variations
as
this
earth
is
pulling
back
the
matterhorn
it
is
the
system
that
nourishes
and
rewards
and
also
freezes
out
life
with
the
chill
of
disregard
we
do
note
that
before
excommunication
is
pronounced
orthodox
journals
do
liberally
enough
record
unassimilable
observations
all
things
merge
away
into
everything
else
that
is
continuity
so
the
system
merges
away
and
evades
us
when
we
try
to
focus
against
it
we
have
complained
a
great
deal
at
least
we
are
not
so
dull
as
to
have
the
delusion
that
we
know
just
exactly
what
it
is
that
we
are
complaining
about
we
speak
seemingly
definitely
enough
of
the
system
but
we
building
upon
observations
by
members
of
that
very
system
or
what
we
are
doing
gathering
up
the
loose
heresies
of
the
orthodox
of
course
the
system
fringes
and
ravels
away
having
no
real
outline
a
swift
will
antagonize
the
system
and
a
lockyer
will
call
him
back
but
then
a
lockyer
will
vary
with
a
meteoric
hypothesis
and
a
swift
will
in

behind

plainly
a

why

the

that

shall
or
we

that
many

have
luminous

been

close
to

but
numerousness
is
a
new
factor
or
new
disturbance
to
our

a
new
aspect
of
inhabitancy

occupancy
worlds

perhaps
would
astonish
me
if

on
the
next
consideration

knew
to
be
impossible
it
was
a
fixed

they
seemed
to
this

not

the
call
of
positiveness
in
its
aspects
of
singleness
or
homogeneity
or
oneness
or
completeness
in
data
now
coming
i
feel
it
myself
a
leverrier
studies
more
than
twenty
observations
the
inclination
is
irresistible
to
think
that
they
all
relate
to
one
phenomenon
it
is
an
expression
of
cosmic
inclination
most
of
the
observations
are
so
irreconcilable
with
any
acceptance
other
than
of
orbitless
dirigible
worlds
that
he
shuts
his
eyes
to
more
than
of
them
he
picks
out
six
that
can
give
him
the
illusion
of
completeness
or
of
all
relating
to
one
planet
or
let
it
be
that
we
have
data
of
many
dark
bodies
still
do
we
incline
almost
irresistibly
to
think
of
one
of
them
as
the
dark
bodies
floating
or
navigating
in
space
and
i
conceive
of
one
that
the
prince
of
dark
bodies
melanicus
vast
dark
thing
with
the
wings
of
a
or
most
likely
one
of
the
spores
of
the
evil
one
the
extraordinary
year
london
extract
from
a
letter
by
hicks
pashaw
that
in
egypt
he
had
seen
through
glasses
an
immense
black
spot
upon
the
lower
part
of
the
sun
sun
spot
maybe
one
night
an
astronomer
was
looking
up
at
the
sky
when
something
obscured
a
star
for
three
and
a
half
seconds
a
meteor
had
been
seen
nearby
but
its
train
had
been
only
momentarily
visible
wolf
was
the
astronomer
the
next
datum
is
one
of
the
most
sensational
we
have
except
that
there
is
very
little
to
it
a
dark
object
that
was
seen
by
heis
for
eleven
degrees
of
arc
moving
slowly
across
the
milky
way
catalogue
brit
one
of
our
for
accepting
that
orbitless
worlds
are
dirigible
is
the
almost
complete
absence
of
data
of
collisions
of
course
though
in
defiance
of
gravitation
they
may
without
direction
like
human
direction
adjust
to
one
another
in
the
way
of
vortex
rings
of
smoke
a
very
way
that
is
but
in
february
are
two
photographs
of
brooks
comet
that
are
shown
as
evidence
of
its
seeming
collision
with
a
dark
object
october
our
own
wording
is
that
it
struck
against
something
barnard
is
that
it
had
entered
some
dense
medium
which
shattered
it
for
all
i
know
it
had
knocked
against
merely
a
field
of
ice
melanicus
that
upon
the
wings
of
a
he
broods
over
this
earth
and
over
other
worlds
perhaps
deriving
something
from
them
hovers
on
wings
or
appendages
or
planes
that
are
hundreds
of
miles
from
tip
to
tip
a
thing
that
is
exploiting
us
by
evil
i
mean
that
which
makes
us
useful
he
obscures
a
star
he
shoves
a
comet
i
think
he
a
vast
black
brooding
vampire
july
that
according
to
a
newspaper
account
brooks
director
of
the
smith
observatory
had
seen
a
dark
round
object
pass
rather
slowly
across
the
moon
in
a
horizontal
direction
in
brooks
opinion
it
was
a
dark
meteor
in
a
correspondent
writes
that
in
his
opinion
it
may
have
been
a
bird
we
shall
have
no
trouble
with
the
meteor
and
bird
mergers
if
we
have
observations
of
long
duration
and
estimates
of
size
up
to
hundreds
of
miles
as
to
the
body
that
was
seen
by
brooks
there
is
a
note
from
the
dutch
astronomer
muller
in
the
that
upon
april
he
had
seen
a
similar
phenomenon
in
are
more
details
of
the
brooks
object
apparent
diameter
about
of
the
moon
moon
disk
crossed
in
three
or
four
seconds
the
writer
in
says
that
on
june
at
one
in
the
morning
he
was
looking
at
the
moon
with
a
achromatic
power
when
a
long
black
object
sailed
past
from
west
to
east
the
transit
occupying
or
seconds
he
believed
this
object
to
be
a
bird
there
was
however
no
fluttering
motion
observable
in
it
in
the
no
brendel
of
griefswald
pomerania
writes
that
postmaster
ziegler
and
other
observers
had
seen
a
body
about
feet
in
diameter
crossing
the
disk
the
duration
here
indicates
something
far
from
the
earth
and
also
far
from
the
sun
this
thing
was
seen
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
reached
the
sun
time
in
crossing
the
sun
was
about
an
hour
after
leaving
the
sun
it
was
visible
an
hour
i
think

a
vast
black
vampire
that
sometimes
broods
over
this
earth
and
other
bodies
communication
from
harris
that
upon
the
evening
of
harris
saw
upon
the
moon
an
intensely
black
object
he
estimated
it
to
be
miles
long
and
miles
wide
the
object
resembled
a
crow
poised
as
near
as
anything
clouds
then
cut
off
observation
harris
writes
i
can
not
but
think
that
a
very
interesting
and
curious
phenomenon
happened
short
chapter
coming
now
and
it
the
worst
of
them
all
i
think
speculative
it
a
lapse
from
our
usual
i
think
it
must
mean
that
the
preceding
chapter
was
very
efficiently
done
and
that
now
by
the
rhythm
of
all
which
ca
be
real
things
if
they
rhythms
because
a
rhythm
is
an
appearance
that
turns
into
its
own
opposite
and
then
back
again
but
now
to
pay
up
we
what
we
were
short
chapter
and
i
think
we
fill
in
with
several
points
in
intermediatism
a
puzzle
if
it
is
our
acceptance
that
out
of
the
negative
absolute
the
positive
absolute
is
generating
itself
recruiting
or
maintaining
itself
via
a
third
state
or
our
own
it
would
seem
that
we
trying
to
conceive
of
universalness
manufacturing
more
universalness
from
nothingness
take
that
up
yourself
if
you
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
disappearing
with
such
velocity
that
you
leave
an
incandescent
train
behind
and
risk
being
infinitely
happy
forever
whereas
you
probably
do
want
to
be
happy
i
sidestep
that
myself
and
try
to
be
intelligible
by
regarding
the
positive
absolute
from
the
aspect
of
realness
instead
of
universalness
recalling
that
by
both
realness
and
universalness
we
mean
the
same
state
or
that
which
does
not
merge
away
into
something
else
because
there
is
nothing
else
so
the
idea
is
that
out
of
unrealness
instead
of
nothingness
realness
instead
of
universalness
is
via
our
own
manufacturing
more
realness
just
so
but
in
relative
terms
of
course
all
imaginings
that
materialize
into
machines
or
statues
buildings
dollars
paintings
or
books
in
paper
and
ink
are
graduations
from
unrealness
to
realness
in
relative
terms
it
would
seem
then
that
intermediateness
is
a
relation
between
the
positive
absolute
and
the
negative
absolute
but
the
absolute
can
not
be
the
related
of
course
a
confession
that
we
really
think
of
it
at
all
if
here
we
think
of
a
limit
to
the
unlimited
doing
the
best
we
can
and
encouraged
by
the
reflection
that
we
ca
do
worse
than
has
been
done
by
metaphysicians
in
the
past
we
accept
that
the
absolute
ca
be
the
related
so
then
that
our
is
not
a
real
relation
if
nothing
in
it
is
real
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
an
unreal
relation
if
nothing
in
it
is
unreal
it
seems
thinkable
that
the
positive
absolute
can
by
means
of
intermediateness
have
a
or
be
only
or
be
the
unrelated
in
final
terms
or
at
least
not
be
the
related
in
final
terms
as
to
free
will
and
intermediatism
same
answer
as
to
everything
else
by
free
will
we
mean
independence
or
that
which
does
not
merge
away
into
something
else
so
in
intermediateness
neither
nor
but
a
different
approximation
for
every
person
toward
one
or
the
other
of
the
extremes
the
hackneyed
way
of
expressing
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
acceptable
way
if
in
intermediateness
there
is
only
the
paradoxical
that
we
free
to
do
what
we
have
to
do
i
am
not
convinced
that
we
make
a
fetish
of
the
preposterous
i
think
our
feeling
is
that
in
first
gropings
there
no
knowing
what
will
afterward
be
the
acceptable
i
think
that
if
an
early
biologist
heard
of
birds
that
grow
on
trees
he
should
record
that
he
had
heard
of
birds
that
grow
on
trees
then
let
sorting
over
of
data
occur
afterward
the
one
thing
that
we
try
to
tone
down
but
that
is
to
a
great
degree
unavoidable
is
having
our
data
all
mixed
up
like
long
island
and
florida
in
the
minds
of
early
american
explorers
my
own
notion
is
that
this
whole
book
is
very
much
like
a
map
of
north
america
in
which
the
hudson
river
is
set
down
as
a
passage
leading
to
siberia
we
think
of
monstrator
and
melanicus
and
of
a
world
that
is
now
in
communication
with
this
earth
if
so
secretly
with
certain
esoteric
ones
upon
this
earth
whether
that
world
monstrator
and
monstrator
melanicus
must
be
the
subject
of
later
inquiry
it
would
be
a
gross
thing
to
do
solve
up
everything
now
and
leave
nothing
to
our
disciples
i
have
been
very
much
struck
with
phenomena
of
cup
marks
they
look
to
me
like
symbols
of
communication
but
they
do
not
look
to
me
like
means
of
communication
between
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
earth
and
other
inhabitants
of
this
earth
my
own
impression
is
that
some
external
force
has
marked
with
symbols
rocks
of
this
earth
from
far
away
i
do
not
think
that
cup
marks
are
inscribed
communications
among
different
inhabitants
of
this
earth
because
it
seems
too
unacceptable
that
inhabitants
of
china
scotland
and
america
should
all
have
conceived
of
the
same
system
cup
marks
are
strings
of
impressions
in
rocks
sometimes
there
are
rings
around
them
and
sometimes
they
have
only
great
britain
america
france
algeria
circassia
palestine
virtually
everywhere
except
in
the
far
north
i
think
in
china
cliffs
are
dotted
with
them
upon
a
cliff
near
lake
como
there
is
a
maze
of
these
markings
in
italy
and
spain
and
india
they
occur
in
enormous
numbers
given
that
a
force
say
like
electric
force
could
from
a
distance
mark
such
a
substance
as
rocks
as
from
a
distance
of
hundreds
of
miles
selenium
can
be
marked
by
telephotographers
but
i
am
of
two
minds
the
lost
explorers
from
somewhere
and
an
attempt
from
somewhere
to
communicate
with
them
so
a
frenzy
of
showering
of
messages
toward
this
earth
in
the
hope
that
some
of
them
would
mark
rocks
near
the
lost
explorers
or
that
somewhere
upon
this
earth
there
is
an
especial
rocky
surface
or
receptor
or
polar
construction
or
a
steep
conical
hill
upon
which
for
ages
have
been
received
messages
from
some
other
world
but
that
at
times
messages
go
astray
and
mark
substances
perhaps
thousands
of
miles
from
the
receptor
that
perhaps
forces
behind
the
history
of
this
earth
have
left
upon
the
rocks
of
palestine
and
england
and
india
and
china
records
that
may
some
day
be
deciphered
of
their
misdirected
instructions
to
certain
esoteric
ones
order
of
the
freemasons
the
jesuits
i
emphasize
the
of
cup
marks
douglas
whatever
may
have
been
their
motive
the
showed
a
decided
liking
for
arranging
their
sculpturings
in
regularly
spaced
rows
that
cup
marks
are
an
archaic
form
of
inscription
was
first
suggested
by
canon
greenwell
many
years
ago
but
more
specifically
adumbratory
to
our
own
expression
are
the
observations
of
roy
asiatic
that
the
braille
system
of
raised
dots
is
an
inverted
arrangement
of
cup
marks
also
that
there
are
strong
resemblances
to
the
morse
code
but
no
tame
and
systematized
archaeologist
can
do
more
than
casually
point
out
resemblances
and
merely
suggest
that
strings
of
cup
marks
look
like
messages
because
china
switzerland
algeria
america
if
messages
they
be
there
seems
to
be
no
escape
from
attributing
one
origin
to
them
then
if
messages
they
be
i
accept
one
external
origin
to
which
the
whole
surface
of
this
earth
was
accessible
for
them
something
else
that
we
emphasize
that
rows
of
cup
marks
have
often
been
likened
to
footprints
but
in
this
similitude
their
unilinear
arrangement
must
be
disregarded
of
course
often
they
mixed
up
in
every
way
but
arrangement
in
single
lines
is
very
common
it
is
odd
that
they
should
so
often
be
likened
to
footprints
i
suppose
there
are
exceptional
cases
but
unless
it
something
that
hops
on
one
foot
or
a
cat
going
along
a
narrow
i
do
think
of
anything
that
makes
footprints
one
directly
ahead
of
another
cop
in
a
station
house
walking
a
chalk
line
perhaps
upon
the
witch
stone
near
ratho
scotland
there
are
cups
varying
in
size
from
one
and
a
half
to
three
inches
in
diameter
arranged
in
approximately
straight
lines
locally
it
is
explained
that
these
are
tracks
of
dogs
feet
soc
antiq
similar
marks
are
scattered
bewilderingly
all
around
the
stone
like
a
frenzy
of
telegraphing
or
like
messages
repeating
and
repeating
trying
to
localize
differently
in
cup
marks
are
called
fairies
footmarks
at
valna
church
norway
and
peter
ambleteuse
there
are
such
marks
said
to
be
horses
hoofprints
the
rocks
of
clare
ireland
are
marked
with
prints
supposed
to
have
been
made
by
a
mythical
cow
we
now
have
such
a
ghost
of
a
thing
that
i
not
like
to
be
interpreted
as
offering
it
as
a
datum
it
simply
illustrates
what
i
mean
by
the
notion
of
symbols
like
cups
or
like
footprints
which
if
like
those
of
horses
or
cows
are
the
reverse
of
or
the
negatives
of
cups
of
symbols
that
are
regularly
received
somewhere
upon
this
earth
steep
conical
hill
somewhere
i
think
but
that
have
often
alighted
in
wrong
places
considerably
to
the
mystification
of
persons
waking
up
some
morning
to
find
them
upon
formerly
blank
spaces
an
ancient
record
still
worse
an
ancient
chinese
record
of
a
courtyard
of
a
palace
dwellers
of
the
palace
waking
up
one
morning
finding
the
courtyard
marked
with
tracks
like
the
footprints
of
an
ox
supposed
that
the
devil
did
it
and
angels
hordes
upon
hordes
of
them
beings
massed
like
the
clouds
of
souls
or
the
commingling
whiffs
of
spirituality
or
the
exhalations
of
souls
that
dor√©
pictured
so
often
it
may
be
that
the
milky
way
is
a
composition
of
stiff
frozen
absolute
angels
we
shall
have
data
of
little
milky
ways
moving
swiftly
or
data
of
hosts
of
angels
not
absolute
or
still
dynamic
i
suspect
myself
that
the
fixed
stars
are
really
fixed
and
that
the
minute
motions
said
to
have
been
detected
in
them
are
illusions
i
think
that
the
fixed
stars
are
absolutes
their
twinkling
is
only
the
interpretation
by
an
intermediatist
state
of
them
i
think
that
soon
after
leverrier
died
a
new
fixed
star
was
discovered
that
if
gray
had
stuck
to
his
story
of
the
thousands
of
fishes
from
one
pail
of
water
had
written
upon
it
lectured
upon
it
taken
to
street
corners
to
convince
the
world
that
whether
conceivable
or
not
his
explanation
was
the
only
true
explanation
had
thought
of
nothing
but
this
last
thing
at
night
and
first
thing
in
the
morning
his
obituary
another
nova
reported
in
i
think
that
milky
ways
of
an
inferior
or
dynamic
order
have
often
been
seen
by
astronomers
of
course
it
may
be
that
the
phenomena
that
we
shall
now
consider
are
not
angels
at
all
we
are
simply
feeling
around
trying
to
find
out
what
we
can
accept
some
of
our
data
indicate
hosts
of
rotund
and
complacent
tourists
in
space
but
then
data
of
long
lean
hungry
ones
i
think
that
there
are
out
in
space
super
tamerlanes
at
the
head
of
hosts
of
celestial
ravagers
which
have
come
here
and
pounced
upon
civilizations
of
the
past
cleaning
them
up
all
but
their
bones
or
temples
and
monuments
for
which
later
historians
have
invented
exclusionist
histories
but
if
something
now
has
a
legal
right
to
us
and
can
enforce
its
proprietorship
they
been
warned
off
it
the
way
of
all
exploitation
i
should
say
that
we
now
under
cultivation
that
conscious
of
it
but
have
the
impertinence
to
attribute
it
all
to
our
own
nobler
and
higher
instincts
against
these
notions
is
the
same
sense
of
finality
that
opposes
all
advance
it
why
we
rate
acceptance
as
a
better
adaptation
than
belief
opposing
us
is
the
strong
belief
that
as
to
phenomena
virtually
everything
has
been
found
out
sense
of
finality
and
illusion
of
homogeneity
but
that
what
is
called
advancing
knowledge
is
violation
of
the
sense
of
blankness
a
drop
of
water
once
upon
a
time
water
was
considered
so
homogeneous
that
it
was
thought
of
as
an
element
the
microscope
and
not
only
that
the
supposititiously
elementary
was
seen
to
be
of
infinite
diversity
but
that
in
its
protoplasmic
life
there
were
new
orders
of
beings
or
the
year
and
a
european
looking
westward
over
the
ocean
his
feeling
that
that
suave
western
droop
was
unbreakable
that
gods
of
regularity
would
not
permit
that
smooth
horizon
to
be
disturbed
by
coasts
or
spotted
with
islands
the
unpleasantness
of
even
contemplating
such
a
state
wide
smooth
west
so
clean
against
the
sky
spotted
with
islands
geographic
leprosy
but
coasts
and
islands
and
indians
and
bison
in
the
seemingly
vacant
west
lakes
mountains
rivers
one
looks
up
at
the
sky
the
relative
homogeneity
of
the
relatively
unexplored
one
thinks
of
only
a
few
kinds
of
phenomena
but
the
acceptance
is
forced
upon
me
that
there
are
modes
and
modes
and
modes
of
existence
things
as
different
from
planets
and
comets
and
meteors
as
indians
are
from
bison
and
prairie
dogs
a
or
celestiography
of
vast
stagnant
regions
but
also
of
and
and
a
voyagers
and
tourists
and
ravagers
the
hunted
and
the
hunting
the
the
the
sense
of
homogeneity
or
our
positivist
illusion
of
the
unknown
and
the
fate
of
all
positivism
astronomy
and
the
academic
ethics
and
the
abstract
the
universal
attempt
to
formulate
or
to
regularize
an
attempt
that
can
be
made
only
by
disregarding
or
denying
or
all
things
disregard
or
deny
that
which
will
eventually
invade
and
destroy
them
until
comes
the
day
when
some
one
thing
shall
say
and
enforce
upon
infinitude
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
here
is
absolute
demarcation
the
final
utterance
there
is
only
i
in
the
notices
of
the
there
is
a
letter
from
the
rev
read
that
upon
the
of
september
at
he
had
seen
a
host
of
bodies
passing
the
field
of
his
telescope
some
slowly
and
some
rapidly
they
appeared
to
occupy
a
zone
several
degrees
in
breadth
the
direction
of
most
of
them
was
due
east
to
west
but
some
moved
from
north
to
south
the
numbers
were
tremendous
they
were
observed
for
six
hours
editor
note
may
not
these
appearances
be
attributed
to
an
abnormal
state
of
the
optic
nerves
of
the
observer
in
read
answers
that
he
had
been
a
diligent
observer
with
instruments
of
a
superior
order
for
about
years
but
i
have
never
witnessed
such
an
appearance
before
as
to
illusion
he
says
that
two
other
members
of
his
family
had
seen
the
objects
the
editor
withdraws
his
suggestion
we
know
what
to
expect
almost
absolutely
in
an
existence
that
is
essentially
hibernian
we
can
predict
the
past
that
is
look
over
something
of
this
kind
written
in
and
know
what
to
expect
from
the
exclusionists
later
if
read
saw
a
migration
of
dissatisfied
angels
numbering
millions
they
must
merge
away
at
least
subjectively
with
commonplace
terrestrial
phenomena
of
course
disregarding
read
probable
familiarity
of
years
duration
with
the
commonplaces
of
terrestrial
phenomena
letter
from
rev
dawes
that
he
had
seen
similar
objects
and
in
the
month
of
september
that
they
were
nothing
but
seeds
floating
in
the
air
in
the
of
the
british
there
is
a
communication
from
read
to
that
the
objects
that
had
been
seen
by
him
and
by
dawes
were
not
similar
he
denies
that
he
had
seen
seeds
floating
in
the
air
there
had
been
little
wind
and
that
had
come
from
the
sea
where
seeds
would
not
be
likely
to
have
origin
the
objects
that
he
had
seen
were
round
and
sharply
defined
and
with
none
of
the
feathery
appearance
of
thistledown
he
then
quotes
from
a
letter
from
chalmers
who
had
seen
a
similar
stream
a
procession
or
migration
except
that
some
of
the
bodies
were
more
elongated
or
lean
and
hungry
than
globular
he
might
have
argued
for
years
he
have
impressed
nobody
of
importance
the
or
dominant
of
his
era
was
exclusionism
and
the
notion
of
seeds
in
the
air
assimilates
with
due
disregards
with
that
dominant
or
pageantries
here
upon
our
earth
and
things
looking
down
upon
us
and
the
crusades
were
only
dust
clouds
and
glints
of
the
sun
on
shining
armor
were
only
particles
of
mica
in
dust
clouds
i
think
it
was
a
crusade
that
read
saw
but
that
it
was
right
relatively
to
the
year
to
say
that
it
was
only
seeds
in
the
wind
whether
the
wind
blew
from
the
sea
or
not
i
think
of
things
that
were
luminous
with
religious
zeal
mixed
up
like
everything
else
in
intermediateness
with
black
marauders
and
from
gray
to
brown
beings
of
little
personal
ambitions
there
may
have
been
a
richard
coeur
de
lion
on
his
way
to
right
wrongs
in
jupiter
it
was
right
relatively
to
to
say
that
he
was
a
seed
of
a
cabbage
coffin
frank
that
during
the
eclipse
of
august
he
had
noted
the
passage
across
his
telescope
of
several
bright
flakes
resembling
thistleblows
floating
in
the
sunlight
but
the
telescope
was
so
focused
that
if
these
things
were
distinct
they
must
have
been
so
far
away
from
this
earth
that
the
difficulties
of
orthodoxy
remain
as
great
one
way
or
another
no
matter
what
we
think
they
were
they
were
says
coffin
henry
waldner
that
april
he
had
seen
great
numbers
of
small
shining
bodies
passing
from
west
to
east
he
had
notified
wolf
of
the
observatory
of
zurich
who
had
convinced
himself
of
this
strange
phenomenon
wolf
had
told
him
that
similar
bodies
had
been
seen
by
sig
capocci
of
the
capodimonte
observatory
at
naples
may
the
shapes
were
of
great
diversity
or
different
aspects
of
similar
shapes
appendages
were
seen
upon
some
of
them
we
are
told
that
some
were
with
transparent
appendages
i
think
myself
it
was
a
mohammed
and
his
hegira
may
have
been
only
his
harem
astonishing
sensation
afloat
in
space
with
ten
million
wives
around
one
anyway
it
would
seem
that
we
have
considerable
advantage
here
inasmuch
as
seeds
are
not
in
season
in
april
but
the
pulling
back
to
earth
the
bedraggling
by
those
sincere
but
dull
ones
of
some
time
ago
we
have
the
same
stupidity
necessary
functioning
stupidity
of
attribution
of
something
that
was
so
rare
that
an
astronomer
notes
only
one
instance
between
and
to
an
occurrence
or
waldner
assimilative
opinion
that
he
had
seen
only
ice
crystals
whether
they
were
not
very
exclusive
veils
of
a
or
planes
of
a
very
light
material
we
have
an
impression
of
things
with
transparent
appendages
that
have
been
seen
in
the
sky

of
small

of

of

we
point
out
that

upon

of
more
complex

observation
at

and

letter
from
sir
robert
inglis
to
sabine
brit
that
at
at
gais
switzerland
inglis
had
seen
thousands
and
thousands
of
brilliant
white
objects
like
snowflakes
in
a
cloudless
sky
though
this
display
lasted
about
minutes
not
one
of
these
seeming
snowflakes
was
seen
to
fall
inglis
says
that
his
servant
fancied
that
he
had
seen
something
like
wings
on
these
whatever
they
were
upon
page
of
the
sir
john
herschel
says
that
in
or
his
attention
had
been
attracted
by
objects
of
considerable
size
in
the
air
seemingly
not
far
away
he
had
looked
at
them
through
a
telescope
he
says
that
they
were
masses
of
hay
not
less
than
a
yard
or
two
in
diameter
still
there
are
some
circumstances
that
interest
me
he
says
that
though
no
less
than
a
whirlwind
could
have
sustained
these
masses
the
air
about
him
was
calm
no
doubt
wind
prevailed
at
the
spot
but
there
was
no
roaring
noise
none
of
these
masses
fell
within
his
observation
or
knowledge
to
walk
a
few
fields
away
and
find
out
more
would
seem
not
much
to
expect
from
a
man
of
science
but
it
is
one
of
our
superstitions
that
such
a
seeming
trifle
is
just
what
by
the
spirit
of
an
era
we
call
it
one
is
not
permitted
to
do
if
those
things
were
not
masses
of
hay
and
if
herschel
had
walked
a
little
and
found
out
and
had
reported
that
he
had
seen
strange
objects
in
the
air
that
report
in
would
have
been
as
misplaced
as
the
appearance
of
a
tail
upon
an
embryo
still
in
its
gastrula
era
i
have
noticed
this
inhibition
in
my
own
case
many
times
looking
back
why
did
i
do
this
or
that
little
thing
that
would
have
cost
so
little
and
have
meant
so
much
did
belong
to
that
era
of
my
own
development
that
at
kattenau
germany
about
half
an
hour
before
sunrise
march
an
enormous
number
of
luminous
bodies
rose
from
the
horizon
and
passed
in
a
horizontal
direction
from
east
to
west
they
are
described
as
having
appeared
in
a
zone
or
belt
they
shone
with
a
remarkably
brilliant
light
so
they
thrown
lassos
over
our
data
to
bring
them
back
to
earth
but
they
lassos
that
can
not
tighten
we
ca
pull
out
of
them
we
may
step
out
of
them
or
lift
them
off
some
of
us
used
to
have
an
impression
of
science
sitting
in
calm
just
judgment
some
of
us
now
feel
that
a
good
many
of
our
data
have
been
lynched
if
a
crusade
perhaps
from
mars
to
jupiter
occur
in
the
autumn
seeds
if
a
crusade
or
outpouring
of
celestial
vandals
is
seen
from
this
earth
in
the
spring
ice
crystals
if
we
have
record
of
a
race
of
aerial
beings
perhaps
with
no
substantial
habitat
seen
by
someone
in
india
locusts
this
will
be
disregarded
if
locusts
fly
high
they
freeze
and
fall
in
thousands
locusts
that
were
seen
in
the
mountains
of
india
at
a
height
of
feet
in
swarms
and
dying
by
thousands
but
no
matter
whether
they
fly
high
or
fly
low
no
one
ever
wonders
what
in
the
air
when
locusts
are
passing
overhead
because
of
the
falling
of
stragglers
i
have
especially
looked
this
matter
up
no
mystery
when
locusts
are
flying
overhead
constant
falling
of
stragglers
an
unusual
phenomenon
noticed
by
lieut
herschel
and
while
observing
the
sun
at
bangalore
india
lieut
herschel
had
noticed
dark
shadows
crossing
the
sun
but
away
from
the
sun
there
were
luminous
moving
images
for
two
days
bodies
passed
in
a
continuous
stream
varying
in
size
and
velocity
the
lieutenant
tries
to
explain
as
we
shall
see
but
he
says
as
it
was
the
continuous
flight
for
two
whole
days
in
such
numbers
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
air
of
beasts
that
left
no
stragglers
is
a
wonder
of
natural
history
if
not
of
astronomy
he
tried
different
focusing
he
saw
wings
perhaps
he
saw
planes
he
says
that
he
saw
upon
the
objects
either
wings
or
appendages
then
he
saw
something
that
was
so
bizarre
that
in
the
fullness
of
his
he
writes
there
was
no
longer
doubt
they
were
locusts
or
flies
of
some
sort
one
of
them
had
paused
it
had
hovered
then
it
had
whisked
off
the
editor
says
that
at
that
time
countless
locusts
had
descended
upon
certain
parts
of
india
we
now
have
an
instance
that
is
extraordinary
in
several
respects
or
angels
ragamuffins
crusaders
emigrants
aeronauts
or
aerial
elephants
or
bison
or
dinosaurs
except
that
i
think
the
thing
had
planes
or
wings
one
of
them
has
been
photographed
it
may
be
that
in
the
history
of
photography
no
more
extraordinary
picture
than
this
has
ever
been
taken
that
at
the
observatory
of
zacatecas
mexico
about
meters
above
sea
level
were
seen
a
large
number
of
small
luminous
bodies
entering
upon
the
disk
of
the
sun
bonilla
telegraphed
to
the
observatories
of
the
city
of
mexico
and
of
puebla
word
came
back
that
the
bodies
were
not
visible
there
because
of
this
parallax
bonilla
placed
the
bodies
relatively
near
the
earth
but
when
we
find
out
what
he
called
relatively
near
the
earth
birds
or
bugs
or
hosts
of
a
or
army
of
a
celestial
richard
coeur
de
lion
our
heresies
rejoice
anyway
his
estimate
is
less
distance
than
the
moon
one
of
them
was
photographed
see
the
photograph
shows
a
long
body

signer
ricco
of
the
observatory
of
palermo
writes
that
at
in
the
morning
he
was
watching
the
sun
when
he
saw
slowly
traversing
its
disk
bodies
in
two
long
parallel
lines
and
a
shorter
parallel
line
the
bodies
looked
winged
to
him
but
so
large
were
they
that
he
had
to
think
of
large
birds
he
thought
of
cranes
he
consulted
ornithologists
and
learned
that
the
configuration
of
parallel
lines
agrees
with
the
of
cranes
this
was
in
anybody
now
living
in
new
york
city
for
instance
would
tell
him
that
also
it
is
a
familiar
formation
of
aeroplanes
but
because
of
data
of
focus
and
subtended
angles
these
beings
or
objects
must
have
been
high
sig
ricco
argues
that
condors
have
been
known
to
fly
three
or
four
miles
high
and
that
heights
reached
by
other
birds
have
been
estimated
at
two
or
three
miles
he
says
that
cranes
have
been
known
to
fly
so
high
that
they
have
been
lost
to
view
our
own
acceptance
in
conventional
terms
is
that
there
is
not
a
bird
of
this
earth
that
would
not
freeze
to
death
at
a
height
of
more
than
four
miles
that
if
condors
fly
three
or
four
miles
high
they
are
birds
that
are
especially
adapted
to
such
altitudes
sig
ricco
estimate
is
that
these
objects
or
beings
or
cranes
must
have
been
at
least
five
and
a
half
miles
high
the
vast
dark
thing
that
looked
like

crow

unholy
dimensions

i
shall
ever
have
any

let
him
or
both
of
them
if
i
shall
ever
have
such
popularity
as
that
note
how
dim
that
bold
black
datum
is
at
the
distance
of
only
two
chapters
the
question
was
it
a
thing
or
the
shadow
of
a
thing
acceptance
either
way
calls
not
for
mere
revision
but
revolution
in
the
science
of
astronomy
but
the
dimness
of
the
datum
of
only
two
chapters
ago
the
carved
stone
disk
of
tarbes
and
the
rain
that
fell
every
afternoon
for
twenty
if
i
have
forgotten
myself
whether
it
was
or
days
upon
one
small
area
we
are
all
thomsons
with
brains
that
have
smooth
and
slippery
though
corrugated
surfaces
or
that
all
intellection
is
associative
or
that
we
remember
that
which
correlates
with
a
dominant
and
a
few
chapters
go
by
and
there
scarcely
an
impression
that
has
slid
off
our
smooth
and
slippery
brains
of
leverrier
and
the
planet
vulcan
there
are
two
ways
by
which
irreconcilables
can
be
remembered
if
they
can
be
correlated
in
a
system
more
nearly
real
than
the
system
that
rejects
them
and
by
repetition
and
repetition
and
repetition
vast
black
thing
like
a
crow
poised
over
the
moon
the
datum
is
so
important
to
us
because
it
enforces
in
another
field
our
acceptance
that
dark
bodies
of
planetary
size
traverse
this
solar
system
our
position
that
the
things
have
been
seen
also
that
their
shadows
have
been
seen
vast
black
thing
poised
like
a
crow
over
the
moon
so
far
it
is
a
single
instance
by
a
single
instance
we
mean
the
negligible
in
serviss
tells
of
a
shadow
that
schroeter
saw
in
in
the
lunar
alps
first
he
saw
a
light
but
then
when
this
region
was
illuminated
he
saw
a
round
shadow
where
the
light
had
been
our
own
expression
that
he
saw
a
luminous
object
near
the
moon
that
that
part
of
the
moon
became
illuminated
and
the
object
was
lost
to
view
but
that
then
its
shadow
underneath
was
seen
serviss
explains
of
course
otherwise
he
not
be
serviss
it
a
little
contest
in
relative
approximations
to
realness
serviss
thinks
that
what
schroeter
saw
was
the
round
shadow
of
a
mountain
in
the
region
that
had
become
lighted
he
assumes
that
schroeter
never
looked
again
to
see
whether
the
shadow
could
be
attributed
to
a
mountain
that
the
crux
conceivably
a
mountain
could
cast
a
round
and
that
means
detached
shadow
in
the
lighted
part
of
the
moon
serviss
could
of
course
explain
why
he
disregards
the
light
in
the
first
place
maybe
it
had
always
been
there
in
the
first
place
if
he
could
explain
he
still
be
an
amateur
we
have
another
datum
i
think
it
is
more
extraordinary
than
vast
thing
black
and
poised
like
a
crow
over
the
moon
but
only
because
it
more
circumstantial
and
because
it
has
corroboration
do
i
think
it
more
extraordinary
than
vast
poised
thing
black
as
a
crow
over
the
moon
russell
who
was
usually
as
orthodox
as
anybody
i
suppose
at
least
he
wrote
after
his
name
tells
in
the
one
of
the
wickedest
or
most
preposterous
stories
that
we
have
so
far
exhumed
that
he
and
another
astronomer
hirst
were
in
the
blue
fountains
near
sydney
and
hirst
was
looking
at
the
moon
he
saw
on
the
moon
what
russell
calls
one
of
those
remarkable
facts
which
being
seen
should
be
recorded
although
no
explanation
can
at
present
be
offered
that
may
be
so
it
is
very
rarely
done
our
own
expression
upon
evolution
by
successive
dominants
and
their
correlates
is
against
it
on
the
other
hand
we
express
that
every
era
records
a
few
observations
out
of
harmony
with
it
but
adumbratory
or
preparatory
to
the
spirit
of
eras
still
to
come
it
very
rarely
done
lashed
by
the
of
a
now
passing
era
the
world
of
astronomers
is
in
a
state
of
terrorism
though
of
a
highly
attenuated
modernized
devitalized
kind
let
an
astronomer
see
something
that
is
not
of
the
conventional
celestial
sights
or
something
that
it
is
improper
to
see
his
very
dignity
is
in
danger
some
one
of
the
corralled
and
scourged
may
stick
a
smile
into
his
back
he
be
thought
of
unkindly
with
a
hardihood
that
is
unusual
in
his
world
of
ethereal
sensitivenesses
russell
says
of
hirst
observation
he
found
a
large
part
of
it
covered
with
a
dark
shade
quite
as
dark
as
the
shadow
of
the
earth
during
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
but
the
climax
of
hardihood
or
impropriety
or
wickedness
preposterousness
or
enlightenment
one
could
hardly
resist
the
conviction
that
it
was
a
shadow
yet
it
could
not
be
the
shadow
of
any
known
body
richard
proctor
was
a
man
of
some
liberality
after
a
while
we
shall
have
a
letter
which
once
upon
a
time
we
have
called
delirious
know
that
we
could
read
such
a
thing
now
for
the
first
time
without
incredulous
laughter
which
proctor
permitted
to
be
published
in
but
a
dark
unknown
world
that
could
cast
a
shadow
upon
a
large
part
of
the
moon
perhaps
extending
far
beyond
the
limb
of
the
moon
a
shadow
as
deep
as
the
shadow
of
this
earth
too
much
for
proctor
politeness
i
have
read
what
he
said
but
it
seems
to
have
been
a
little
coarse
russell
says
that
proctor
freely
used
his
name
in
the
of
march
ridiculing
this
observation
which
had
been
made
by
russell
as
well
as
hirst
if
it
had
been
proctor
it
would
have
been
someone
else
but
one
notes
that
the
attack
came
out
in
a
newspaper
there
is
no
discussion
of
this
remarkable
subject
no
mention
in
any
other
astronomic
journal
the
disregard
was
almost
complete
but
we
do
note
that
the
columns
of
the
were
open
to
russell
to
answer
proctor
in
the
answer
i
note
considerable
intermediateness
far
back
in
it
would
have
been
a
beautiful
positivism
if
russell
had
said
there
was
a
shadow
on
the
moon
absolutely
it
was
cast
by
an
unknown
body
according
to
our
religion
if
he
had
then
given
all
his
time
to
the
maintaining
of
this
one
stand
of
course
breaking
all
friendships
all
ties
with
his
fellow
astronomers
his
apotheosis
would
have
occurred
greatly
assisted
by
means
well
known
to
when
its
compromises
and
evasions
and
phenomena
that
are
partly
this
and
partly
that
are
flouted
by
the
definite
and
uncompromising
it
would
be
impossible
in
a
real
existence
but
russell
of
says
that
he
did
resist
the
conviction
that
he
had
said
that
one
could
hardly
resist
and
most
of
his
resentment
is
against
thinking
that
he
had
not
resisted
it
seems
too
bad
if
apotheosis
be
desirable
the
point
in
intermediatism
here
is
not
that
to
adapt
to
the
conditions
of
is
to
have
what
is
called
success
in
but
is
to
lose
one
soul
but
is
to
lose
one
chance
of
attaining
soul
self
or
entity
one
indignation
quoted
from
proctor
interests
us
what
happens
on
the
moon
may
at
any
time
happen
to
this
earth
or
that
is
just
the
teaching
of
this
department
of
advanced
astronomy
that
russell
and
hirst
saw
the
sun
eclipsed
relatively
to
the
moon
by
a
vast
dark
body
that
many
times
have
eclipses
occurred
relatively
to
this
earth
by
vast
dark
bodies
that
there
have
been
many
eclipses
that
have
not
been
recognized
as
eclipses
by
scientific
kindergartens
there
is
a
merger
of
course
we
take
a
look
at
it
first
that
after
all
it
may
have
been
a
shadow
that
hirst
and
russell
saw
but
the
only
significance
is
that
the
sun
was
eclipsed
relatively
to
the
moon
by
a
cosmic
haze
of
some
kind
or
a
swarm
of
meteors
close
together
or
a
gaseous
discharge
left
behind
by
a
comet
my
own
acceptance
is
that
vagueness
of
shadow
is
a
function
of
vagueness
of
intervention
that
a
shadow
as
dense
as
the
shadow
of
this
earth
is
cast
by
a
body
denser
than
hazes
and
swarms
the
information
seems
definite
enough
in
this
respect
quite
as
dark
as
the
shadow
of
this
earth
during
the
eclipse
of
the
moon
though
we
may
not
always
be
as
patient
toward
them
as
we
should
be
it
is
our
acceptance
that
the
astronomic
primitives
have
done
a
great
deal
of
good
work
for
instance
in
the
allaying
of
fears
upon
this
earth
sometimes
it
may
seem
as
if
all
science
were
to
us
very
much
like
what
a
red
flag
is
to
bulls
and
it
not
that
it
more
like
what
unsquare
meals
are
to
bulls
and
not
the
scientific
but
the
insufficient
our
acceptance
is
that
evil
is
the
negative
state
by
which
we
mean
the
state
of
maladjustment
discord
ugliness
disorganization
inconsistency
injustice
and
so
on
as
determined
in
intermediateness
not
by
real
standards
but
only
by
higher
approximations
to
adjustment
harmony
beauty
organization
consistency
justice
and
so
on
evil
is
outlived
virtue
or
incipient
virtue
that
has
not
yet
established
itself
or
any
other
phenomenon
that
is
not
in
seeming
adjustment
harmony
consistency
with
a
dominant
the
astronomers
have
functioned
bravely
in
the
past
they
been
good
for
business
the
big
interests
think
kindly
if
at
all
of
them
it
bad
for
trade
to
have
an
intense
darkness
come
upon
an
unaware
community
and
frighten
people
out
of
their
purchasing
values
but
if
an
obscuration
be
foretold
and
if
it
then
occur
may
seem
a
little
uncanny
only
a
shadow
and
no
one
who
was
about
to
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
runs
home
and
saves
the
money
upon
general
principles
we
accept
that
astronomers
have
data
of
eclipses
or
have
included
some
and
disregarded
others
they
have
done
well
they
have
functioned
but
now
they
negatives
or
they
out
of
harmony
if
we
are
in
harmony
with
a
new
dominant
or
the
spirit
of
a
new
era
in
which
exclusionism
must
be
overthrown
if
we
have
data
of
many
obscurations
that
have
occurred
not
only
upon
the
moon
but
upon
our
own
earth
as
convincing
of
vast
intervening
bodies
usually
invisible
as
is
any
regularized
predicted
eclipse
one
looks
up
at
the
sky
it
seems
incredible
that
say
at
the
distance
of
the
moon
there
could
be
but
be
invisible
a
solid
body
say
the
size
of
the
moon
one
looks
up
at
the
moon
at
a
time
when
only
a
crescent
of
it
is
visible
the
tendency
is
to
build
up
the
rest
of
it
in
one
mind
but
the
unillumined
part
looks
as
vacant
as
the
rest
of
the
sky
and
it
of
the
same
blueness
as
the
rest
of
the
sky
there
a
vast
area
of
solid
substance
before
one
eyes
it
indistinguishable
from
the
sky
in
some
of
our
little
lessons
upon
the
beauties
of
modesty
and
humility
we
have
picked
out
basic
arrogances
tail
of
a
peacock
horns
of
a
stag
dollars
of
a
capitalist
eclipses
of
astronomers
though
i
have
no
desire
for
the
job
i
engage
to
list
hundreds
of
instances
in
which
the
report
upon
an
expected
eclipse
has
been
sky
overcast
or
weather
unfavorable
in
our
the
unfavorable
has
been
construed
as
the
favorable
some
time
ago
when
we
were
lost
because
we
had
not
recognized
our
own
dominant
when
we
were
still
of
the
unchosen
and
likely
to
be
more
malicious
than
we
now
are
because
we
have
noted
a
steady
tolerance
creeping
into
our
attitude
if
astronomers
are
not
to
blame
but
are
only
correlates
to
a
dominant
we
advertised
a
predicted
eclipse
that
did
not
occur
at
all
now
without
any
especial
feeling
except
that
of
recognition
of
the
fate
of
all
attempted
absolutism
we
give
the
instance
noting
that
though
such
an
evil
thing
to
orthodoxy
it
was
orthodoxy
that
recorded
the
notices
of
the
remarkable
appearances
during
the
total
eclipse
of
the
moon
on
march
in
an
extract
from
a
letter
from
forster
of
bruges
it
is
said
that
according
to
the
writer
observations
at
the
time
of
the
predicted
total
eclipse
the
moon
shone
with
about
three
times
the
intensity
of
the
mean
illumination
of
an
eclipsed
lunar
disk
that
the
british
consul
at
ghent
who
did
not
know
of
the
predicted
eclipse
had
written
enquiring
as
to
the
color
of
the
moon
this
is
not
very
satisfactory
to
what
used
to
be
our
malices
but
there
follows
another
letter
from
another
astronomer
walkey
who
had
made
observations
at
clyst
lawrence
that
instead
of
an
eclipse
the
moon
became
as
is
printed
in
italics
most
beautifully
illuminated
rather
tinged
with
a
deep
red
the
moon
being
as
perfect
with
light
as
if
there
had
been
no
eclipse
whatever
i
note
that
chambers
in
his
work
upon
eclipses
gives
forster
letter
in
full
and
not
a
mention
of
walkey
letter
there
is
no
attempt
in
to
explain
upon
the
notion
of
greater
distance
of
the
moon
and
the
earth
shadow
falling
short
which
would
make
as
much
trouble
for
astronomers
if
that
were
not
foreseen
as
no
eclipse
at
all
also
there
is
no
refuge
in
saying
that
virtually
never
even
in
total
eclipses
is
the
moon
totally
dark
as
perfect
with
light
as
if
there
had
been
no
eclipse
whatever
it
is
said
that
at
the
time
there
had
been
an
aurora
borealis
which
might
have
caused
the
luminosity
without
a
datum
that
such
an
effect
by
an
aurora
had
ever
been
observed
upon
the
moon
but
single
instances
so
an
observation
by
scott
in
the
antarctic
the
force
of
this
datum
lies
in
my
own
acceptance
based
upon
especially
looking
up
this
point
that
an
eclipse
of
totality
has
great
effect
even
though
the
sky
be
clouded
scott
of
the
vol
ii
there
may
have
been
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
as
the
almanac
said
but
we
should
none
of
us
have
liked
to
swear
to
the
fact
this
eclipse
had
been
set
down
at
of
totality
the
sky
was
overcast
at
the
time
so
it
is
not
only
that
many
eclipses
unrecognized
by
astronomers
as
eclipses
have
occurred
but
that
intermediatism
or
impositivism
breaks
into
their
own
seemingly
regularized
eclipses
our
data
of
unregularized
eclipses
as
profound
as
those
that
are
conventionally
or
officially
recognized
that
have
occurred
relatively
to
this
earth
in
and
there
are
several
allusions
to
intense
darknesses
that
have
occurred
upon
this
earth
quite
as
eclipses
occur
but
that
are
not
referable
to
any
known
eclipsing
body
of
course
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
these
darknesses
may
have
been
eclipses
my
own
acceptance
is
that
if
in
the
nineteenth
century
anyone
had
uttered
such
a
thought
as
that
he
have
felt
the
blight
of
a
dominant
that
materialistic
science
was
a
jealous
god
excluding
as
works
of
the
devil
all
utterances
against
the
seemingly
uniform
regular
periodic
that
to
defy
him
would
have
brought
on
withering
by
ridicule
shrinking
away
by
publishers
contempt
of
friends
and
family
justifiable
grounds
for
divorce
that
one
who
would
so
defy
would
feel
what
unbelievers
in
relics
of
saints
felt
in
an
earlier
age
what
befell
virgins
who
forgot
to
keep
fires
burning
in
a
still
earlier
age
but
that
if
he
almost
absolutely
hold
out
just
the
same
new
fixed
star
reported
in
altogether
the
point
in
positivism
here
is
that
by
dominants
and
their
correlates
strives
for
the
positive
state
aggregating
around
a
nucleus
or
dominant
systematized
members
of
a
religion
a
science
a
society
but
that
individuals
who
do
not
surrender
and
submerge
may
of
themselves
highly
approximate
to
positiveness
the
fixed
the
real
the
absolute
in
and
there
is
an
account
of
a
darkness
in
holland
in
the
midst
of
a
bright
day
so
intense
and
terrifying
that
many
persons
lost
their
lives
stumbling
into
the
canals
a
darkness
that
came
upon
london
greater
than
at
the
great
eclipse
of
however
our
preference
is
not
to
go
so
far
back
for
data
for
a
list
of
historic
dark
days
see
humboldt
weather
march
that
according
to
the
crosse
daily
of
march
darkness
suddenly
settled
upon
the
city
of
oshkosh
at
march
in
five
minutes
the
darkness
equaled
that
of
midnight
consternation
i
think
that
some
of
us
are
likely
to
overdo
our
own
superiority
and
the
absurd
fears
of
the
middle
ages
oshkosh
people
in
the
streets
rushing
in
all
directions
horses
running
away
women
and
children
running
into
cellars
little
modern
touch
after
all
gas
meters
instead
of
images
and
relics
of
saints
this
darkness
which
lasted
from
eight
to
ten
minutes
occurred
in
a
day
that
had
been
light
but
cloudy
it
passed
from
west
to
east
and
brightness
followed
then
came
reports
from
towns
to
the
west
of
oshkosh
that
the
same
phenomenon
had
already
occurred
there
a
wave
of
total
darkness
had
passed
from
west
to
east
other
instances
are
recorded
in
the
weather
but
as
to
all
of
them
we
have
a
sense
of
being
pretty
ourselves
by
the
conventional
explanation
that
the
obscuring
body
was
only
a
very
dense
mass
of
clouds
but
some
of
the
instances
are
interesting
intense
darkness
at
memphis
for
about
fifteen
minutes
at
we
are
told
that
in
some
quarters
a
panic
prevailed
and
that
some
were
shouting
and
praying
and
imagining
that
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
at
louisville
march
at
about
duration
about
half
an
hour
had
been
raining
moderately
and
then
hail
had
fallen
the
intense
blackness
and
general
ominous
appearance
of
the
storm
spread
terror
throughout
the
city
however
this
merger
between
possible
eclipses
by
unknown
dark
bodies
and
commonplace
terrestrial
phenomena
is
formidable
as
to
darknesses
that
have
fallen
upon
vast
areas
conventionality
is
smoke
from
forest
fires
in
the
forest
service
no
plummer
gives
a
list
of
eighteen
darknesses
that
have
occurred
in
the
united
states
and
canada
he
is
one
of
the
primitives
but
i
should
say
that
his
dogmatism
is
shaken
by
vibrations
from
the
new
dominant
his
difficulty
which
he
acknowledges
but
which
he
would
have
disregarded
had
he
written
a
decade
or
so
earlier
is
the
profundity
of
some
of
these
obscurations
he
says
that
mere
smokiness
can
not
account
for
such
dark
days
so
he
conceives
of
eddies
in
the
air
concentrating
the
smoke
from
forest
fires
then
in
the
inconsistency
or
discord
of
all
that
is
striving
for
consistency
or
harmony
he
tells
of
the
vastness
of
some
of
these
darknesses
of
course
plummer
did
not
really
think
upon
this
subject
but
one
does
feel
that
he
might
have
approximated
higher
to
real
thinking
than
by
speaking
of
concentration
and
then
listing
data
of
enormous
area
or
the
opposite
of
circumstances
of
concentration
because
of
his
nineteen
instances
nine
are
set
down
as
covering
all
new
england
in
everything
generates
or
is
part
of
its
own
opposite
every
attempt
at
peace
prepares
the
way
for
war
all
attempts
at
justice
result
in
injustice
in
some
other
respect
so
plummer
attempt
to
bring
order
into
his
data
with
the
explanation
of
darkness
caused
by
smoke
from
forest
fires
results
in
such
confusion
that
he
ends
up
by
saying
that
these
daytime
darknesses
have
occurred
often
with
little
or
no
turbidity
of
the
air
near
the
earth
surface
or
with
no
evidence
at
all
of
smoke
except
that
there
is
almost
always
a
forest
fire
somewhere
however
of
the
eighteen
instances
the
only
one
that
i
bother
to
contest
is
the
profound
darkness
in
canada
and
northern
parts
of
the
united
states
which
we
have
already
considered
its
concomitants
lights
in
the
sky
fall
of
a
black
substance
shocks
like
those
of
an
earthquake
in
this
instance
the
only
available
forest
fire
was
one
to
the
south
of
the
ohio
river
for
all
i
know
soot
from
a
very
great
fire
south
of
the
ohio
might
fall
in
montreal
canada
and
conceivably
by
some
freak
of
reflection
light
from
it
might
be
seen
in
montreal
but
the
earthquake
is
not
assimilable
with
a
forest
fire
on
the
other
hand
it
will
soon
be
our
expression
that
profound
darkness
fall
of
matter
from
the
sky
lights
in
the
sky
and
earthquakes
are
phenomena
of
the
near
approach
of
other
worlds
to
this
world
it
is
such
comprehensiveness
as
contrasted
with
inclusion
of
a
few
factors
and
disregard
for
the
rest
that
we
call
higher
approximation
to
realness
or
universalness
a
darkness
of
april
at
wimbledon
england
met
it
came
from
a
smokeless
region
no
rain
no
thunder
lasted
minutes
too
dark
to
go
even
out
in
the
open
as
to
darknesses
in
great
britain
one
thinks
of
fogs
but
in
there
are
some
observations
by
major
herschel
upon
an
obscuration
in
london
at
so
great
that
he
could
hear
persons
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
but
could
not
see
them
it
was
obvious
that
there
was
no
fog
to
speak
of
an
account
by
charles
murray
british
envoy
to
persia
of
a
darkness
of
may
that
came
upon
bagdad
a
darkness
more
intense
than
ordinary
midnight
when
neither
stars
nor
moon
are
visible
after
a
short
time
the
black
darkness
was
succeeded
by
a
red
lurid
gloom
such
as
i
never
saw
in
any
part
of
the
world
panic
seized
the
whole
city
a
dense
volume
of
red
sand
fell
this
matter
of
sand
falling
seems
to
suggest
conventional
explanation
enough
or
that
a
simoon
heavily
charged
with
terrestrial
sand
had
obscured
the
sun
but
murray
who
says
that
he
had
had
experience
with
simoons
gives
his
opinion
that
it
can
not
have
been
a
simoon
it
is
our
comprehensiveness
now
or
this
matter
of
concomitants
of
darknesses
that
we
are
going
to
capitalize
it
is
all
very
complicated
and
tremendous
and
our
own
treatment
can
be
but
impressionistic
but
a
few
of
the
rudiments
of
advanced
seismology
we
shall
now
take
up
or
the
four
principal
phenomena
of
another
world
close
approach
to
this
world
if
a
large
substantial
mass
or
should
enter
this
earth
atmosphere
it
is
our
acceptance
that
it
would
sometimes
depending
upon
velocity
appear
luminous
or
look
like
a
cloud
or
like
a
cloud
with
a
luminous
nucleus
later
we
shall
have
an
expression
upon
luminosity
different
from
the
luminosity
of
incandescence
that
comes
upon
objects
falling
from
the
sky
or
entering
this
earth
atmosphere
now
our
expression
is
that
worlds
have
often
come
close
to
this
earth
and
that
smaller
objects
size
of
a
haystack
or
size
of
several
dozen
skyscrapers
lumped
have
often
hurtled
through
this
earth
atmosphere
and
have
been
mistaken
for
clouds
because
they
were
enveloped
in
clouds
or
that
around
something
coming
from
the
intense
cold
of
space
that
is
of
some
regions
our
own
suspicion
is
that
other
regions
are
tropical
the
moisture
of
this
earth
atmosphere
would
condense
into
a
appearance
around
it
in
there
is
an
account
by
clifton
collector
of
customs
at
freemantle
western
australia
sent
to
the
melbourne
observatory
a
clear
day
appearance
of
a
small
black
cloud
moving
not
very
swiftly
bursting
into
a
ball
of
fire
of
the
apparent
size
of
the
moon
or
that
something
with
the
velocity
of
an
ordinary
meteorite
could
not
collect
vapor
around
it
but
that
objects
speed
of
a
railway
train
say
may
the
clouds
of
tornadoes
have
so
often
been
described
as
if
they
were
solid
objects
that
i
now
accept
that
sometimes
they
are
that
some
tornadoes
are
objects
hurtling
through
this
atmosphere
not
only
generating
disturbances
by
their
suctions
but
crushing
with
their
bulk
all
things
in
their
way
rising
and
falling
and
finally
disappearing
demonstrating
that
gravitation
is
not
the
power
that
the
primitives
think
it
is
if
an
object
moving
at
relatively
low
velocity
be
not
pulled
to
this
earth
or
being
so
momentarily
affected
bounds
away
in
finley
on
the
character
of
very
suggestive
bits
of
description
occur
cloud
bounded
along
the
earth
like
a
ball
or
that
it
was
no
meteorological
phenomenon
but
something
very
much
like
a
huge
solid
ball
that
was
bounding
along
crushing
and
carrying
with
it
everything
within
its
field
cloud
bounded
along
coming
to
the
earth
every
eight
hundred
or
one
thousand
yards
here
an
interesting
bit
that
i
got
somewhere
else
i
offer
it
as
a
datum
in
which
however
is
a
branch
of
advanced
science
that
i
not
take
up
restricting
to
things
indefinitely
called
objects
the
tornado
came
wriggling
jumping
whirling
like
a
great
green
snake
darting
out
a
score
of
glistening
fangs
though
it
interesting
i
think
that
sensational
myself
it
may
be
that
vast
green
snakes
sometimes
rush
past
this
earth
taking
a
swift
bite
wherever
they
can
but
as
i
say
that
a
phenomenon
finley
gives
dozens
of
instances
of
tornado
clouds
that
seem
to
me
more
like
solid
things
swathed
in
clouds
than
clouds
he
notes
that
in
the
tornado
at
americus
georgia
july
a
strange
sulphurous
vapor
was
emitted
from
the
cloud
in
many
instances
objects
or
meteoritic
stones
that
have
come
from
this
externality
have
had
a
sulphurous
odor
why
a
wind
effect
should
be
sulphurous
is
not
clear
that
a
vast
object
from
external
regions
should
be
sulphurous
is
in
line
with
many
data
this
phenomenon
is
described
in
the
weather
july
as
a
strange
sulphurous
vapor
burning
and
sickening
all
who
approached
close
enough
to
breathe
it
the
conventional
explanation
of
tornadoes
as
which
we
do
not
deny
in
some
instances
is
so
strong
in
the
united
states
that
it
is
better
to
look
elsewhere
for
an
account
of
an
object
that
has
hurtled
through
this
earth
atmosphere
rising
and
falling
and
defying
this
earth
gravitation
that
according
to
a
correspondent
to
the
morning
the
people
living
near
king
sutton
banbury
saw
about
one
something
like
a
haycock
hurtling
through
the
air
like
a
meteor
it
was
accompanied
by
fire
and
a
dense
smoke
and
made
a
noise
like
that
of
a
railway
train
it
was
sometimes
high
in
the
air
and
sometimes
near
the
ground
the
effect
was
trees
and
walls
were
knocked
down
it
a
late
day
now
to
try
to
verify
this
story
but
a
list
is
given
of
persons
whose
property
was
injured
we
are
told
that
this
thing
then
disappeared
all
at
once
these
are
the
smaller
objects
which
may
be
derailed
railway
trains
or
big
green
snakes
for
all
i
know
but
our
expression
upon
approach
to
this
earth
by
vast
dark
bodies
that
likely
they
be
made
luminous
would
envelop
in
clouds
perhaps
or
would
have
their
own
clouds
but
that
they
quake
and
that
they
affect
this
earth
with
quakes
and
that
then
would
occur
a
fall
of
matter
from
such
a
world
or
rise
of
matter
from
this
earth
to
a
nearby
world
or
both
fall
and
rise
or
exchange
of
matter
process
known
to
advanced
seismology
as
except
that
if
matter
from
some
other
world
and
it
would
be
like
someone
to
get
it
into
his
head
that
we
absolutely
deny
gravitation
just
because
we
can
not
accept
orthodox
dogmas
except
that
if
matter
from
another
world
filling
the
sky
of
this
earth
generally
as
to
a
hemisphere
or
locally
should
be
attracted
to
this
earth
it
would
seem
thinkable
that
the
whole
thing
should
drop
here
and
not
merely
its
objects
upon
a
ship
bottom
from
time
to
time
they
drop
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
ship
does
not
or
like
our
acceptance
upon
dripping
from
aerial
we
think
of
only
a
part
of
a
nearby
world
succumbing
except
in
being
caught
in
suspension
to
this
earth
gravitation
and
falling
from
that
part
explain
or
express
or
accept
and
what
does
it
matter
our
attitude
is
here
are
the
data
see
for
yourself
what
does
it
matter
what
my
notions
may
be
here
are
the
data
but
think
for
yourself
or
think
for
myself
all
mixed
up
we
must
be
a
long
time
must
go
by
before
we
can
know
florida
from
long
island
so
we
had
data
of
fishes
that
have
fallen
from
our
now
established
and
respectabilized
sea
which
we
almost
forgotten
now
so
respectable
but
we
shall
have
data
of
fishes
that
have
fallen
during
earthquakes
these
we
accept
were
dragged
down
from
ponds
or
other
worlds
that
have
been
quaked
when
only
a
few
miles
away
by
this
earth
some
other
world
also
quaking
this
earth
in
a
way
or
in
its
principle
our
subject
is
orthodox
enough
only
grant
proximity
of
other
worlds
which
however
will
not
be
a
matter
of
granting
but
will
be
a
matter
of
data
and
one
conventionally
conceives
of
their
surfaces
quaked
even
of
a
whole
lake
full
of
fishes
being
quaked
and
dragged
down
from
one
of
them
the
lake
full
of
fishes
may
cause
a
little
pain
to
some
minds
but
the
fall
of
sand
and
stones
is
pleasantly
enough
thought
of
more
scientific
persons
or
more
faithful
hypnotics
than
we
have
taken
up
this
subject
unpainfully
relatively
to
the
moon
for
instance
perrey
has
gone
over
records
of
earthquakes
and
he
has
correlated
many
with
proximities
of
the
moon
or
has
attributed
many
to
the
pull
of
the
moon
when
nearest
this
earth
also
there
is
a
paper
upon
this
subject
in
the
roy
soc
of
or
theoretically
when
at
its
closest
to
this
earth
the
moon
quakes
the
face
of
this
earth
and
is
itself
quaked
but
does
not
itself
fall
to
this
earth
as
to
showers
of
matter
that
may
have
come
from
the
moon
at
such
times
one
can
go
over
old
records
and
find
what
one
pleases
that
is
what
we
now
shall
do
our
expressions
are
for
acceptance
only
our
data
we
take
them
from
four
classes
of
phenomena
that
have
preceded
or
accompanied
earthquakes
unusual
clouds
darkness
profound
luminous
appearances
in
the
sky
and
falls
of
substances
and
objects
whether
commonly
called
meteoritic
or
not
not
one
of
these
occurrences
fits
in
with
principles
of
primitive
or
primary
seismology
and
every
one
of
them
is
a
datum
of
a
quaked
body
passing
close
to
this
earth
or
suspended
over
it
to
the
primitives
there
is
not
a
reason
in
the
world
why
a
convulsion
of
this
surface
should
be
accompanied
by
unusual
sights
in
the
sky
by
darkness
or
by
the
fall
of
substances
or
objects
from
the
sky
as
to
phenomena
like
these
or
storms
preceding
earthquakes
the
irreconcilability
is
still
greater
it
was
before
that
perrey
made
his
great
compilation
we
take
most
of
our
data
from
lists
compiled
long
ago
only
the
safe
and
unpainful
have
been

the
restraining
hand
of
the
system
as
we
call
it
whether
it
has
any
real
existence
or
not
is
tight
upon
the
sciences
of
today
the
uncanniest
aspect
of
our
that
i
know
of
is
that
everything
that
seems
to
have
one
identity
has
also
as
high
a
seeming
of
everything
else
in
this
oneness
of
allness
or
continuity
the
protecting

the
parental

love
is
inseparable
from
phenomena
of
hate
there
is
only
continuity
that
is
in
at
least
in
its
correspondents
columns
still
evades
this
protective
strangulation
and
the
weather
is
still
a
rich
field
of
unfaithful
observation
but
in
looking
over
other
periodicals
i
have
noted
their
glimmers
of
fade
gradually
after
about
and
the
surrender
of
their
attempted
identities
to
a
higher
attempted
organization
some
of

to

that
here
and

there

have
been

of

whose
occasional
illiberalities
i
not
like
to
emphasize
too
much
all
succeeding
volumes
of

yielded
scarcely
an
unconventionality
note
the
great
number
of
times
that
the

of

that
after

they
scarcely

illicit

as
by

we
keep
on
saying
about

the

could
not
be
positive
and
many
of
the
excommunicated
continued
to
creep
in
or
even
to
this
day
some
of
the
strangled
are
faintly
breathing
some
of
our
data
have
been
hard
to
find
we
could
tell
stories
of
great
labor
and
fruitless
quests
that
would
though
perhaps
imperceptibly
stir
the
sympathy
of
a
symons

in
this

of

it
up

nothing

that

of

may
hold
out
against
the
cosmos
that
once
upon
a

thousands
of
fishes
were
cast
from

we
have
for
these

if
obedient
slaves
to
the

and
repulsion
to
them
if
mere
correlates
to
the
old

i
a
soulless
and
selfless
correlate
to

myself
i
see
what
i
have
to
see
the
only
inducement
i
can
hold
out
in
my
attempt
to
rake
up
disciples
is
that
some
day
the
new
will
be
fashionable
the
new
correlates
will
sneer
at
the
old
correlates
after
all
there
is
some
inducement
to
that
and
i
not
altogether
sure
it
desirable
to
end
up
as
a
fixed
star
as
a
correlate
to
the
new
dominant
i
am
very
much
impressed
with
some
of
these
data
the
luminous
object
that
moved
in
the
same
direction
as
an
earthquake
it
seems
very
acceptable
that
a
quake
followed
this
thing
as
it
passed
near
this
earth
surface
the
streak
that
was
seen
in
the
sky
or
only
a
streak
that
was
visible
of
another
world
and
objects
or
meteorites
that
were
shaken
down
from
it
the
quake
at
carpentras
france
and
that
above
carpentras
was
a
smaller
world
more
violently
quaked
so
that
earth
was
shaken
down
from
it
but
i
like
best
the
that
were
seen
to
cross
the
sun
during
the
earthquake
at
palermo
they
howled
or
the
loves
of
the
worlds
the
call
they
feel
for
one
another
they
try
to
move
closer
and
howl
when
they
get
there
the
howls
of
the
planets
i
have
discovered
a
new
unintelligibility
in
the
new
philosophical
have
to
go
away
back
to
days
of
less
efficient
strangulation
sir
david
milne
lists
phenomena
of
quakes
in

i
pick
out
a
few
that
indicate
to
me
that
other
worlds
were
near
this
earth
surface
violent

before
a
shock
of
ball
of
fire
preceding
a
large
ball
of
fire
seen
upon
day
following
a
quake
uncommon
phenomenon
in
the

a
large
luminous
body
bent
like
a

which
stretched
itself

vast

numerous

black
and
lowering

some
of
these
instances
seem
to
me
to
be
very
striking
a
smaller
world
it
is
greatly
racked
by
the
attraction
of
this
earth
black
substance
is
torn
down
from
it
not
until
six
hours
later
after
an
approach
still
closer
does
this
earth
suffer
perturbation
as
to
the
extraordinary
spectacle
of
a
thing
world
that
was
seen
in
the
sky
in
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
find
out
more
i
think
that
here
our
acceptance
is
relatively
sound
that
this
occurrence
was
tremendously
of
more
importance
than
such
occurrence
as
say
transits
of
venus
upon
which
hundreds
of
papers
have
been
written
that
not
another
mention
have
i
found
though
i
have
not
looked
so
especially
as
i
shall
look
for
more
data
that
all
but
undetailed
record
of
this
occurrence
was
suppressed
altogether
we
have
considerable
agreement
here
between
data
of
vast
masses
that
do
not
fall
to
this
earth
but
from
which
substances
fall
and
data
of
fields
of
ice
from
which
ice
may
not
fall
but
from
which
water
may
drip
i
beginning
to
modify
that
at
a
distance
from
this
earth
gravitation
has
more
effect
than
we
have
supposed
though
less
effect
than
the
dogmatists
suppose
and
prove
i
coming
out
stronger
for
the
acceptance
of
a
neutral
zone
that
this
earth
like
other
magnets
has
a
neutral
zone
in
which
is
the
sea
and
in
which
other
worlds
may
be
buoyed
up
though
projecting
parts
may
be
subject
to
this
earth
attraction
but
my
preference
here
are
the
data
i
now
have
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
the
new
correlates
i
think
i
should
have
brought
it
in
before
but
whether
out
of
place
here
because
not
accompanied
by
earthquake
or
not
we
have
it
i
offer
it
as
an
instance
of
an
eclipse
by
a
vast
dark
body
that
has
been
seen
and
reported
by
an
astronomer
the
astronomer
is
lias
the
phenomenon
was
seen
by
him
at
pernambuco
april
it
was
about
noon
sky
cloudless
suddenly
the
light
of
the
sun
was
diminished
the
darkness
increased
and
to
illustrate
its
intensity
we
are
told
that
the
planet
venus
shone
brilliant
but
venus
was
of
low
visibility
at
this
time
the
observation
that
burns
incense
to
the
new
dominant
is
that
around
the
sun
appeared
a
corona
there
are
many
other
instances
that
indicate
proximity
of
other

earthquakes

it
an

that

were

i

not
myself
and
have
data
for
thinking
not
but
be
such
a
row
arguing
back
and
forth
that
it
simpler
to
consider
a
clearer
instance
of
the
fall
of
living
fishes
from
the
sky
during
an
earthquake
i
ca
quite
accept
myself
whether
a
large
lake
and
all
the
fishes
in
it
was
torn
down
from
some
other
world
or
a
lake
in
the
sea
distracted
between
two
pulling
worlds
was
dragged
down
to
this
earth
here
are
the
data
science
pour
an
earthquake
at
singapore
then
came
an
extraordinary
downpour
of
rain
or
as
much
water
as
any
lake
would
consist
of
for
three
days
this
rain
or
this
fall
of
water
came
down
in
torrents
in
pools
on
the
ground
formed
by
this
deluge
great
numbers
of
fishes
were
found
the
writer
says
that
he
had
himself
seen
nothing
but
water
fall
from
the
sky
whether
i
emphasizing
what
a
deluge
it
was
or
not
he
says
that
so
terrific
had
been
the
downpour
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
three
steps
away
from
him
the
natives
said
that
the
fishes
had
fallen
from
the
sky
three
days
later
the
pools
dried
up
and
many
dead
fishes
were
found
but
in
the
first
place
though
an
expression
for
which
we
have
an
instinctive
dislike
the
fishes
had
been
active
and
uninjured
then
follows
material
for
another
of
our
little
studies
in
the
phenomena
of
disregard
a
here
is
mechanically
to
take
pen
in
hand
and
mechanically
write
that
fishes
found
on
the
ground
after
a
heavy
rainfall
came
from
overflowing
streams
the
writer
of
the
account
says
that
some
of
the
fishes
had
been
found
in
his
courtyard
which
was
surrounded
by
high
walls
paying
no
attention
to
this
a
correspondent
science
pour
explains
that
in
the
heavy
rain
a
body
of
water
had
probably
overflowed
carrying
fishes
with
it
we
are
told
by
the
first
writer
that
these
fishes
of
singapore
were
of
a
species
that
was
very
abundant
near
singapore
so
i
think
myself
that
a
whole
lakeful
of
them
had
been
shaken
down
from
the
sea
under
the
circumstances
we
have
thought
of
however
if
appearance
of
strange
fishes
after
an
earthquake
be
more
pleasing
in
the
sight
or
to
the
nostrils
of
the
new
dominant
we
faithfully
and
piously
supply
that
incense
an
account
of
the
occurrence
at
singapore
was
read
by
de
castelnau
before
the
french
academy
de
castelnau
recalled
that
upon
a
former
occasion
he
had
submitted
to
the
academy
the
circumstance
that
fishes
of
a
new
species
had
appeared
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
after
an
earthquake
it
seems
proper
and
it
will
give
luster
to
the
new
orthodoxy
now
to
have
an
instance
in
which
not
merely
quake
and
fall
of
rocks
or
meteorites
or
quake
and
either
eclipse
or
luminous
appearances
in
the
sky
have
occurred
but
in
which
are
combined
all
the
phenomena
one
or
more
of
which
when
accompanying
earthquake
indicate
in
our
acceptance
the
proximity
of
another
world
this
time
a
longer
duration
is
indicated
than
in
other
instances
in
the
institute
there
is
an
account
by
the
deputy
commissioner
at
dhurmsalla
of
the
extraordinary
dhurmsalla
meteorite
coated
with
ice
but
the
combination
of
events
related
by
him
is
still
more
extraordinary
that
within
a
few
months
of
the
fall
of
this
meteorite
there
had
been
a
fall
of
live
fishes
at
benares
a
shower
of
red
substance
at
furruckabad
a
dark
spot
observed
on
the
disk
of
the
sun
an
earthquake
an
unnatural
darkness
of
some
duration
and
a
luminous
appearance
in
the
sky
that
looked
like
an
aurora
borealis
but
there
more
to
this
climax
we
are
introduced
to
a
new
order
of
phenomena
visitors
the
deputy
commissioner
writes
that
in
the
evening
after
the
fall
of
the
dhurmsalla
meteorite
or
mass
of
stone
covered
with
ice
he
saw
lights
some
of
them
were
not
very
high
they
appeared
and
went
out
and
reappeared
i
have
read
many
accounts
of
the
dhurmsalla
meteorite
july
but
never
in
any
other
of
them
a
mention
of
this
new
correlate
something
as
out
of
place
in
the
nineteenth
century
as
would
have
been
an
aeroplane
the
invention
of
which
would
not
in
our
acceptance
have
been
permitted
in
the
nineteenth
century
though
adumbrations
to
it
were
permitted
this
writer
says
that
the
lights
moved
like
fire
balloons
but
i
am
sure
that
they
were
neither
fire
balloons
lanterns
nor
bonfires
or
any
other
thing
of
that
sort
but
bona
fide
lights
in
the
heavens
it
a
subject
for
which
we
shall
have
to
have
a
separate
expression
trespassers
upon
territory
to
which
something
else
has
a
legal
right
perhaps
someone
lost
a
rock
and
he
and
his
friends
came
down
looking
for
it
in
the
evening
or
secret
agents
or
emissaries
who
had
an
appointment
with
certain
esoteric
ones
near
dhurmsalla
things
or
beings
coming
down
to
explore
and
unable
to
stay
down
long
in
a
way
another
strange
occurrence
during
an
earthquake
is
suggested
the
ancient
chinese
tradition
the
marks
like
hoof
marks
in
the
ground
we
have
thought
with
a
low
degree
of
acceptance
of
another
world
that
may
be
in
secret
communication
with
certain
esoteric
ones
of
this
earth
inhabitants
and
of
messages
in
symbols
like
hoof
marks
that
are
sent
to
some
receptor
or
special
hill
upon
this
earth
and
of
messages
that
at
times
miscarry
this
other
world
comes
close
to
this
world
there
are
quakes
but
advantage
of
proximity
is
taken
to
send
a
message
the
message
designed
for
a
receptor
in
india
perhaps
or
in
central
europe
miscarries
all
the
way
to
england
marks
like
the
marks
of
the
chinese
tradition
are
found
upon
a
beach
in
cornwall
after
an
earthquake
after
the
quake
of
july
upon
the
sands
of
penzance
cornwall
in
an
area
of
more
than
square
yards
were
found
marks
like
hoof
prints
except
that
they
were
not
crescentic
we
feel
a
similarity
but
note
an
arbitrary
disregard
of
our
own
this
time
it
seems
to
us
that
marks
described
as
little
cones
surrounded
by
basins
of
equal
diameter
would
be
like
hoof
prints
if
hoofs
printed
complete
circles
other
disregards
are
that
there
were
black
specks
on
the
tops
of
cones
as
if
something
perhaps
gaseous
had
issued
from
them
that
from
one
of
these
formations
came
a
gush
of
water
as
thick
as
a
man
wrist
of
course
the
opening
of
springs
is
common
in
earthquakes
but
we
suspect
myself
that
the
negative
absolute
is
compelling
us
to
put
in
this
datum
and
its
disorders
there
another
matter
in
which
the
negative
absolute
seems
to
work
against
us
though
to
we
have
introduced
the
principle
of
we
have
no
good
data
of
exchange
of
substances
during
proximities
the
data
are
all
of
falls
and
not
of
upward
translations
of
course
upward
impulses
are
common
during
earthquakes
but
i
have
a
datum
upon
a
tree
or
a
fish
or
a
brick
or
a
man
that
ever
did
go
up
and
stay
up
and
that
never
did
come
down
again
our
classic
of
the
horse
and
barn
occurred
in
what
was
called
a
whirlwind
it
is
said
that
in
an
earthquake
in
calabria
paving
stones
shot
up
far
in
the
air
the
writer
does
specifically
say
that
they
came
down
again
but
something
seems
to
tell
me
they
did
the
corpses
of
riobamba
humboldt
reported
that
in
the
quake
of
riobamba
bodies
were
torn
upward
from
graves
that
the
vertical
motion
was
so
strong
that
bodies
were
tossed
several
hundred
feet
in
the
air
i
explain
i
explain
that
if
in
the
center
of
greatest
violence
of
an
earthquake
anything
ever
has
gone
up
and
has
kept
on
going
up
the
thoughts
of
the
nearest
observers
were
very
likely
upon
other
subjects
the
quay
of
lisbon
we
are
told
that
it
went
down
a
vast
throng
of
persons
ran
to
the
quay
for
refuge
the
city
of
lisbon
was
in
profound
darkness
the
quay
and
all
the
people
on
it
disappeared
if
it
and
they
went
down
not
a
single
corpse
not
a
shred
of
clothing
not
a
plank
of
the
quay
nor
so
much
as
a
splinter
of
it
ever
floated
to
the
surface
the
new
dominant
i
mean
primarily
all
that
opposes
exclusionism
that
development
or
progress
or
evolution
is
attempt
to
positivize
and
is
a
mechanism
by
which
a
positive
existence
is
recruited
that
what
we
call
existence
is
a
womb
of
infinitude
and
is
itself
only
incubatory
that
eventually
all
attempts
are
broken
down
by
the
falsely
excluded
subjectively
the
breaking
down
is
aided
by
our
own
sense
of
false
and
narrow
limitations
so
the
classic
and
academic
artists
wrought
positivist
paintings
and
expressed
the
only
ideal
that
i
am
conscious
of
though
we
so
often
hear
of
ideals
instead
of
different
manifestations
artistically
scientifically
theologically
politically
of
the
one
ideal
they
sought
to
satisfy
in
its
artistic
aspect
cosmic
craving
for
unity
or
completeness
sometimes
called
harmony
called
beauty
in
some
aspects
by
disregard
they
sought
completeness
but
the
that
they
disregarded
and
their
narrow
confinement
to
standardized
subjects
brought
on
the
revolt
of
the
impressionists
so
the
puritans
tried
to
systematize
and
they
disregarded
physical
needs
or
vices
or
relaxations
they
were
invaded
and
overthrown
when
their
narrowness
became
obvious
and
intolerable
all
things
strive
for
positiveness
for
themselves
or
for
of
which
they
are
parts
formality
and
the
mathematic
the
regular
and
the
uniform
are
aspects
of
the
positive
state
but
the
positive
is
the
universal
so
all
attempted
positiveness
that
seems
to
satisfy
in
the
aspects
of
formality
and
regularity
sooner
or
later
disqualifies
in
the
aspect
of
wideness
or
universalness
so
there
is
revolt
against
the
science
of
today
because
the
formulated
utterances
that
were
regarded
as
final
truths
in
a
past
generation
are
now
seen
to
be
insufficiencies
every
pronouncement
that
has
opposed
our
own
acceptances
has
been
found
to
be
a
composition
like
any
academic
painting
something
that
is
arbitrarily
cut
off
from
relations
with
environment
or
framed
off
from
interfering
and
disturbing
data
or
outlined
with
disregards
our
own
attempt
has
been
to
take
in
the
included
but
also
to
take
in
the
excluded
into
wider
expressions
we
accept
however
that
for
every
one
of
our
expressions
there
are
irreconcilables
somewhere
that
final
utterance
would
include
all
things
however
of
such
is
the
gossip
of
angels
the
final
is
unutterable
in
where
to
think
is
to
include
but
also
to
exclude
or
be
not
final
if
we
admit
that
for
every
opinion
we
have
expressed
there
must
somewhere
be
an
irreconcilable
we
are
intermediatists
and
not
positivists
not
even
higher
positivists
of
course
it
may
be
that
some
day
we
shall
systematize
and
dogmatize
and
refuse
to
think
of
anything
that
we
may
be
accused
of
disregarding
and
believe
instead
of
merely
accepting
then
if
we
could
have
a
wider
system
which
would
acknowledge
no
irreconcilables
we
be
higher
positivists
so
long
as
we
only
accept
we
are
not
higher
positivists
but
our
feeling
is
that
the
new
dominant
even
though
we
have
thought
of
it
only
as
another
enslavement
will
be
the
nucleus
for
higher
positivism
and
that
it
will
be
the
means
of
elevating
into
infinitude
a
new
batch
of
fixed
stars
until
as
a
recruiting
instrument
it
too
will
play
out
and
will
give
way
to
some
new
medium
for
generating
absoluteness
it
is
our
acceptance
that
all
astronomers
of
today
have
lost
their
souls
or
rather
all
chance
of
attaining
entity
but
that
copernicus
and
kepler
and
galileo
and
newton
and
conceivably
leverrier
are
now
fixed
stars
some
day
i
shall
attempt
to
identify
them
in
all
this
i
think
we
quite
a
moses
we
point
out
the
promised
land
but
unless
we
be
cured
of
our
intermediatism
will
never
be
reported
in
ourself
in
our
acceptance
dominants
in
their
succession
displace
preceding
dominants
not
only
because
they
are
more
nearly
positive
but
because
the
old
dominants
as
recruiting
mediums
play
out
our
expression
is
that
the
new
dominant
of
wider
inclusions
is
now
manifesting
throughout
the
world
and
that
the
old
exclusionism
is
everywhere
breaking
down
in
physics
exclusionism
is
breaking
down
by
its
own
researches
in
radium
for
instance
and
in
its
speculations
upon
electrons
or
its
merging
away
into
metaphysics
and
by
the
desertion
that
has
been
going
on
for
many
years
by
such
men
as
gurney
crookes
wallace
flammarion
lodge
to
formerly
disregarded
phenomena
no
longer
called
spiritualism
but
now
psychic
research
biology
is
in
chaos
conventional
darwinites
mixed
up
with
mutationists
and
orthogenesists
and
followers
of
wisemann
who
take
from
darwinism
one
of
its
and
nevertheless
try
to
reconcile
their
heresies
with
orthodoxy
the
painters
are
metaphysicians
and
psychologists
the
breaking
down
of
exclusionism
in
china
and
japan
and
in
the
united
states
has
astonished
history
the
science
of
astronomy
is
going
downward
so
that
though
pickering
for
instance
did
speculate
upon
a
planet
and
lowell
did
try
to
have
accepted
heretical
ideas
as
to
marks
on
mars
attention
is
now
minutely
focused
upon
such
technicalities
as
variations
in
shades
of
jupiter
fourth
satellite
i
think
that
in
general
acceptance
indicates
decadence
i
think
that
the
stronghold
of
inclusionism
is
in
aeronautics
i
think
that
the
stronghold
of
the
old
dominant
when
it
was
new
was
in
the
invention
of
the
telescope
or
that
coincidentally
with
the
breakdown
of
exclusionism
appears
the
means
of
finding
out
whether
there
are
vast
aerial
fields
of
ice
and
floating
lakes
full
of
frogs
and
fishes
or
not
where
carved
stones
and
black
substances
and
great
quantities
of
vegetable
matter
and
flesh
which
may
be
dragons
flesh
come
from
whether
there
are
trade
routes
and
vast
areas
devastated
by
whether
sometimes
there
are
visitors
to
this
earth
who
might
be
pursued
and
captured
and
questioned
i
have
industriously
sought
data
for
an
expression
upon
birds
but
the
prospecting
has
not
been
very
i
think
i
rather
emphasize
our
industriousness
because
a
charge
likely
to
be
brought
against
the
attitude
of
acceptance
is
that
one
who
only
accepts
must
be
one
of
languid
interest
and
little
application
of
energy
it
seem
to
work
out
we
are
very
industrious
i
suggest
to
some
of
our
disciples
that
they
look
into
the
matter
of
messages
upon
pigeons
of
course
attributed
to
earthly
owners
but
said
to
be
undecipherable
do
it
ourselves
only
that
would
be
selfish
that
more
of
the
intermediatism
that
will
keep
us
out
of
the
firmament
positivism
is
absolute
egoism
but
look
back
in
the
time
of
andr√©e
polar
expedition
pigeons
that
would
have
no
publicity
ordinarily
were
often
reported
at
that
time
in
the
is
recorded
an
instance
of
a
bird
puffin
that
had
fallen
to
the
ground
with
a
fractured
head
interesting
but
mere
speculation
but
what
solid
object
high
in
the
air
had
that
bird
struck
against
tremendous
red
rain
in
france
and
great
storm
at
the
time
and
red
rain
supposed
to
have
been
colored
by
matter
swept
up
from
this
earth
surface
and
then
precipitated
but
in
the
description
of
this
red
rain
differs
from
one
impression
of
red
sandy
or
muddy
water
it
is
said
that
this
rain
was
so
vividly
red
and
so
that
many
persons
in
france
were
terrified
two
analyses
are
given
one
chemist
notes
a
great
quantity
of
corpuscles
whether
corpuscles
or
not
in
the
matter
the
other
chemist
sets
down
organic
matter
at
per
cent
it
may
be
that
an
dragon
had
been
slain
somewhere
or
that
this
red
fluid
in
which
were
many
corpuscles
came
from
something
not
altogether
pleasant
to
contemplate
about
the
size
of
the
catskill
mountains
perhaps
but
the
present
datum
is
that
with
this
substance
larks
quail
ducks
and
water
hens
some
of
them
alive
fell
at
lyons
and
grenoble
and
other
places
i
have
notes
upon
other
birds
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
but
unaccompanied
by
the
red
rain
that
makes
the
fall
of
birds
in
france
peculiar
and
very
peculiar
if
it
be
accepted
that
the
red
substance
was
the
other
notes
are
upon
birds
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
in
the
midst
of
storms
or
of
exhausted
but
living
birds
falling
not
far
from
a
but
now
we
shall
have
an
instance
for
which
i
can
find
no
parallel
fall
of
dead
birds
from
a
clear
sky
from
any
storm
to
which
they
could
be
attributed
so
remote
from
any
discoverable
storm
that
my
own
notion
is
that
in
the
summer
of
something
or
some
beings
came
as
near
to
this
earth
as
they
could
upon
a
hunting
expedition
that
in
the
summer
of
an
expedition
of
passed
over
this
earth
and
let
down
a
dragnet
and
what
would
it
catch
sweeping
through
the
air
supposing
it
to
have
reached
not
quite
to
this
earth
in
the
weather
may
mcatee
quotes
from
the
baton
rouge
correspondence
to
the
that
in
the
summer
of
into
the
streets
of
baton
rouge
and
from
a
clear
sky
fell
hundreds
of
dead
birds
there
were
wild
ducks
and
cat
birds
woodpeckers
and
many
birds
of
strange
plumage
some
of
them
resembling
canaries
usually
one
does
not
have
to
look
very
far
from
any
place
to
learn
of
a
storm
but
the
best
that
could
be
done
in
this
instance
was
to
say
there
had
been
a
storm
on
the
coast
of
florida
and
unless
he
have
repulsion
for
the
explanation
the
reader
feels
only
momentary
astonishment
that
dead
birds
from
a
storm
in
florida
should
fall
from
an
unstormy
sky
in
louisiana
and
with
his
intellect
greased
like
the
plumage
of
a
wild
duck
the
datum
then
drops
off
our
greasy
shiny
brains
that
they
may
be
of
some
use
after
all
that
other
modes
of
existence
place
a
high
value
upon
them
as
lubricants
that
we
hunted
for
them
a
hunting
expedition
to
this
earth
the
newspapers
report
a
tornado
if
from
a
clear
sky
or
a
sky
in
which
there
were
no
driven
clouds
or
other
evidences
of
or
if
from
a
storm
in
florida
it
could
be
accepted
that
hundreds
of
birds
had
fallen
far
away
in
louisiana
i
conceive
conventionally
of
heavier
objects
having
fallen
in
alabama
say
and
of
the
fall
of
still
heavier
objects
still
nearer
the
origin
in
florida
the
sources
of
information
of
the
weather
bureau
are
widespread
it
has
no
records
of
such
falls
so
a
dragnet
that
was
let
down
from
above
somewhere
or
something
that
i
learned
from
the
more
scientific
of
the
investigators
of
psychic
phenomena
the
reader
begins
their
works
with
prejudice
against
telepathy
and
everything
else
of
psychic
phenomena
the
writers
deny
and
say
that
the
seeming
data
are
data
of
only
telepathy
astonishing
instances
of
seeming
clairvoyance
only
telepathy
after
a
while
the
reader
finds
himself
agreeing
that
only
telepathy
which
at
first
had
been
intolerable
to
him
so
maybe
in
a
did
not
sweep
through
this
atmosphere
gathering
up
all
the
birds
within
its
field
the
meshes
then
suddenly
breaking
or
that
the
birds
of
baton
rouge
were
only
from
the
sea
upon
which
we
shall
have
another
expression
we
thought
we
settled
that
and
we
thought
we
establish
that
but
nothing
ever
settled
and
nothing
ever
established
in
a
real
sense
if
in
a
real
sense
there
is
nothing
in
quasiness
i
suppose
there
had
been
a
storm
somewhere
the
storm
in
florida
perhaps
and
many
birds
had
been
swept
upward
into
the
sea
it
has
frigid
regions
and
it
has
tropical
regions
that
birds
of
diverse
species
had
been
swept
upward
into
an
icy
region
where
huddling
together
for
warmth
they
had
died
then
later
they
had
been
dislodged
meteor
coming
along
boat
bicycle
dragon
do
know
what
did
come
along
something
dislodged
them
so
leaves
of
trees
carried
up
there
in
whirlwinds
staying
there
years
ages
perhaps
only
a
few
months
but
then
falling
to
this
earth
at
an
unseasonable
time
for
dead
leaves
fishes
carried
up
there
some
of
them
dying
and
drying
some
of
them
living
in
volumes
of
water
that
are
in
abundance
up
there
or
that
fall
sometimes
in
the
deluges
that
we
call
cloudbursts
the
astronomers
wo
think
kindly
of
us
and
we
have
done
anything
to
endear
ourselves
to
the
meteorologists
but
we
weak
and
mawkish
intermediatists
several
times
we
tried
to
get
the
aeronauts
with
us
extraordinary
things
up
there
things
that
curators
of
museums
would
give
up
all
hope
of
ever
being
fixed
stars
to
obtain
things
left
over
from
whirlwinds
of
the
time
of
the
pharaohs
perhaps
or
that
elijah
did
go
up
in
the
sky
in
something
like
a
chariot
and
may
not
be
vega
after
all
and
that
there
may
be
a
wheel
or
so
left
of
whatever
he
went
up
in
we
basely
suggest
that
it
would
bring
a
high
price
but
sell
soon
because
after
a
while
there
be
thousands
of
them
hawked
around
we
weakly
drop
a
hint
to
the
aeronauts
in
the
there
is
an
account
of
some
hay
that
fell
from
the
sky
from
the
circumstances
we
incline
to
accept
that
this
hay
went
up
in
a
whirlwind
from
this
earth
in
the
first
place
reached
the
sea
and
remained
there
a
long
time
before
falling
an
interesting
point
in
this
expression
is
the
usual
attribution
to
a
local
and
coinciding
whirlwind
and
identification
of
it
and
then
data
that
make
that
local
whirlwind
unacceptable
that
upon
july
small
masses
of
damp
hay
had
fallen
at
monkstown
ireland
in
the
daily
moore
had
explained
he
had
found
a
nearby
whirlwind
to
the
south
of
monkstown
that
coincided
but
according
to
the
a
similar
fall
had
occurred
near
wrexham
england
two
days
before
in
november
i
made
some
studies
upon
light
objects
thrown
into
the
air
i
suppose
i
should
have
been
more
emotionally
occupied
but
i
made
notes
upon
papers
thrown
high
in
the
air
from
windows
of
office
buildings
scraps
of
paper
did
stay
together
for
a
while
several
minutes
sometimes
that
upon
the
of
april
at
autriche
a
great
number
of
oak
leaves
enormous
segregation
of
them
fell
from
the
sky
very
calm
day
so
little
wind
that
the
leaves
fell
almost
vertically
fall
lasted
about
ten
minutes
flammarion
in
tells
this
story
he
has
to
find
a
storm
he
does
find
a
squall
but
it
had
occurred
upon
april
flammarion
two
incredibilities
are
that
leaves
could
remain
a
week
in
the
air
that
they
could
stay
together
a
week
in
the
air
think
of
some
of
your
own
observations
upon
papers
thrown
from
an
aeroplane
our
one
incredibility
that
these
leaves
had
been
whirled
up
six
months
before
when
they
were
common
on
the
ground
and
had
been
sustained
of
course
not
in
the
air
but
in
a
region
gravitationally
inert
and
had
been
precipitated
by
the
disturbances
of
april
rains
i
have
no
records
of
leaves
that
have
so
fallen
from
the
sky
in
october
or
november
the
season
when
one
might
expect
dead
leaves
to
be
raised
from
one
place
and
precipitated
somewhere
else
i
emphasize
that
this
occurred
in
april
that
upon
april
dried
leaves
of
different
species
oak
elm
fell
from
the
sky
this
day
too
was
a
calm
day
the
fall
was
tremendous
the
leaves
were
seen
to
fall
fifteen
minutes
but
judging
from
the
quantity
on
the
ground
it
is
the
writer
opinion
that
they
had
already
been
falling
half
an
hour
i
think
that
the
geyser
of
corpses
that
sprang
from
riobamba
toward
the
sky
must
have
been
an
interesting
sight
if
i
were
a
painter
i
like
that
subject
but
this
cataract
of
dried
leaves
too
is
a
study
in
the
rhythms
of
the
dead
in
this
datum
the
point
most
agreeable
to
us
is
the
very
point
that
the
writer
in
emphasizes
windlessness
he
says
that
the
surface
of
the
loire
was
absolutely
smooth
the
river
was
strewn
with
leaves
as
far
as
he
could
see
that
upon
the
of
april
dried
leaves
fell
at
clairvaux
and
france
the
fall
is
described
as
prodigious
half
an
hour
then
upon
the
a
fall
of
dried
leaves
occurred
at
pontcarr√©
it
is
in
this
recurrence
that
we
found
some
of
our
opposition
to
the
conventional
explanation
the
editor
flammarion
explains
he
says
that
the
leaves
had
been
caught
up
in
a
cyclone
which
had
expended
its
force
that
the
heavier
leaves
had
fallen
first
we
think
that
that
was
all
right
for
and
that
it
was
quite
good
enough
for
but
in
these
more
exacting
days
we
want
to
know
how
insufficient
to
hold
some
leaves
in
the
air
could
sustain
others
four
days
the
factors
in
this
expression
are
unseasonableness
not
for
dried
leaves
but
for
prodigious
numbers
of
dried
leaves
direct
fall
windlessness
month
of
april
and
localization
in
france
the
factor
of
localization
is
interesting
not
a
note
have
i
upon
fall
of
leaves
from
the
sky
except
these
notes
were
the
conventional
explanation
or
old
correlate
acceptable
it
would
seem
that
similar
occurrences
in
other
regions
should
be
as
frequent
as
in
france
the
indication
is
that
there
may
be
undulations
in
the
sea
or
a
pronounced
inclination
toward
france
inspiration
that
there
may
be
a
nearby
world
complementary
to
this
world
where
autumn
occurs
at
the
time
that
is
springtime
here
let
some
disciple
have
that
but
there
may
be
a
dip
toward
france
so
that
leaves
that
are
borne
high
there
are
more
likely
to
be
held
in
suspension
than
highflying
leaves
elsewhere
some
other
time
i
shall
take
up
and
be
guilty
of
charts
i
think
now
that
the
sea
is
an
oblique
belt
with
changing
ramifications
over
great
britain
france
italy
and
on
to
india
relatively
to
the
united
states
i
am
not
very
clear
but
think
especially
of
the
southern
states
the
preponderance
of
our
data
indicates
frigid
regions
aloft
nevertheless
such
phenomena
as
putrefaction
have
occurred
often
enough
to
make
regions
also
acceptable
we
shall
have
one
more
datum
upon
the
sea
it
seems
to
me
that
by
this
time
our
requirements
of
support
and
reinforcement
and
agreement
have
been
quite
as
rigorous
for
acceptance
as
ever
for
belief
at
least
for
full
acceptance
by
virtue
of
mere
acceptance
we
may
in
some
later
book
deny
the
sea
and
find
that
our
data
relate
to
some
other
complementary
world
instead
or
the
moon
and
have
abundant
data
for
accepting
that
the
moon
is
not
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
miles
away
however
the
sea
functions
very
well
as
a
nucleus
around
which
to
gather
data
that
oppose
exclusionism
that
is
our
main
motive
to
oppose
exclusionism
or
our
agreement
with
cosmic
processes
the
climax
of
our
general
expression
upon
the
sea
coincidentally
appears
something
else
that
may
overthrow
it
later
and
that
in
the
province
of
macerata
italy
summer
of
an
immense
number
of
small
clouds
covered
the
sky
about
an
hour
later
a
storm
broke
and
myriad
seeds
fell
to
the
ground
it
is
said
that
they
were
identified
as
products
of
a
tree
found
only
in
central
africa
and
the
antilles
if
in
terms
of
conventional
reasoning
these
seeds
had
been
high
in
the
air
they
had
been
in
a
cold
region
but
it
is
our
acceptance
that
these
seeds
had
for
a
considerable
time
been
in
a
warm
region
and
for
a
time
longer
than
is
attributable
to
suspension
by
it
is
said
that
a
great
number
of
the
seeds
were
in
the
first
stage
of
germination
the
new
dominant
inclusionism
in
it
we
have
a
we
have
a
datum
and
we
give
it
an
interpretation
in
accordance
with
our
at
present
we
have
not
the
delusions
of
absolutism
that
may
have
translated
some
of
the
positivists
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
heaven
we
are
intermediatists
but
feel
a
lurking
suspicion
that
we
may
some
day
solidify
and
dogmatize
and
illiberalize
into
higher
positivists
at
present
we
do
not
ask
whether
something
be
reasonable
or
preposterous
because
we
recognize
that
by
reasonableness
and
preposterousness
are
meant
agreement
and
disagreement
with
a
standard
which
must
be
a
delusion
though
not
absolutely
of
course
and
must
some
day
be
displaced
by
a
more
advanced
scientists
in
the
past
have
taken
the
positivist
attitude
is
this
or
that
reasonable
or
unreasonable
analyze
them
and
we
find
that
they
meant
relatively
to
a
standard
such
as
newtonism
daltonism
darwinism
or
lyellism
but
they
have
written
and
spoken
and
thought
as
if
they
could
mean
real
reasonableness
and
real
unreasonableness
so
our
is
inclusionism
and
if
a
datum
be
a
correlate
to
a
more
widely
inclusive
outlook
as
to
this
earth
and
its
externality
and
relations
with
externality
its
harmony
with
inclusionism
admits
it
such
was
the
process
and
such
was
the
requirement
for
admission
in
the
days
of
the
old
dominant
our
difference
is
in
underlying
intermediatism
or
consciousness
that
though
we
more
nearly
real
we
and
our
standards
are
only
quasi
or
that
all
things
in
our
intermediate
state
are
phantoms
in
a
in
a
dreaming
state
but
striving
to
awaken
to
realness
though
in
some
respects
our
own
intermediatism
is
unsatisfactory
our
underlying
feeling
is
that
in
a
dreaming
mind
awakening
is
accelerated
if
phantoms
in
that
mind
know
that
they
only
phantoms
in
a
dream
of
course
they
too
are
quasi
or
but
in
a
relative
sense
they
have
an
essence
of
what
is
called
realness
they
are
derived
from
experience
or
from
even
though
grotesque
distortions
it
seems
acceptable
that
a
table
that
is
seen
when
one
is
awake
is
more
nearly
real
than
a
dreamed
table
which
with
fifteen
or
twenty
legs
chases
one
so
now
in
the
twentieth
century
with
a
change
of
terms
and
a
change
in
underlying
consciousness
our
attitude
toward
the
new
dominant
is
the
attitude
of
the
scientists
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
the
old
dominant
we
do
not
insist
that
our
data
and
interpretations
shall
be
as
shocking
grotesque
evil
ridiculous
childish
insincere
laughable
ignorant
to
as
were
their
data
and
interpretations
to
the
we
ask
only
whether
data
and
interpretations
correlate
if
they
do
they
are
acceptable
perhaps
only
for
a
short
time
or
as
nuclei
or
scaffolding
or
preliminary
sketches
or
as
gropings
and
tentativenesses
later
of
course
when
we
cool
off
and
harden
and
radiate
into
space
most
of
our
present
mobility
which
expresses
in
modesty
and
plasticity
we
shall
acknowledge
no
scaffoldings
gropings
or
tentativenesses
but
think
we
utter
absolute
facts
a
point
in
intermediatism
here
is
opposed
to
most
current
speculations
upon
development
usually
one
thinks
of
the
spiritual
as
higher
than
the
material
but
in
our
acceptance
is
a
means
by
which
the
absolutely
immaterial
materializes
absolutely
and
being
intermediate
is
a
state
in
which
nothing
is
finally
either
immaterial
or
material
all
objects
substances
thoughts
occupying
some
grade
of
approximation
one
way
or
the
other
final
solidification
of
the
ethereal
is
to
us
the
goal
of
cosmic
ambition
positivism
is
puritanism
heat
is
evil
final
good
is
absolute
frigidity
an
arctic
winter
is
very
beautiful
but
i
think
that
an
interest
in
monkeys
chattering
in
palm
trees
accounts
for
our
own
intermediatism
visitors
our
confusion
here
out
of
which
we
are
attempting
to
make
is
as
great
as
it
has
been
throughout
this
book
because
we
have
not
the
positivist
delusion
of
homogeneity
a
positivist
would
gather
all
data
that
seem
to
relate
to
one
kind
of
visitors
and
coldly
disregard
all
other
data
i
think
of
as
many
different
kinds
of
visitors
to
this
earth
as
there
are
visitors
to
new
york
to
a
jail
to
a
church
some
persons
go
to
church
to
pick
pockets
for
instance
my
own
acceptance
is
that
either
a
world
or
a
vast
or
a
world
if
red
substances
and
fishes
fell
from
it
hovered
over
india
in
the
summer
of
something
then
fell
from
somewhere
july
at
dhurmsalla
whatever
it
was
it
is
so
persistently
alluded
to
as
a
meteorite
that
i
look
back
and
see
that
i
adopted
this
convention
myself
but
in
the
london
syed
abdoolah
professor
of
hindustani
university
college
london
writes
that
he
had
sent
to
a
friend
in
dhurmsalla
for
an
account
of
the
stones
that
had
fallen
at
that
place
the
answer
divers
forms
and
sizes
many
of
which
bore
great
resemblance
to
ordinary
cannon
balls
just
discharged
from
engines
of
war
it
an
addition
to
our
data
of
spherical
objects
that
have
arrived
upon
this
earth
note
that
they
are
spherical
stone
objects
and
in
the
evening
of
this
same
day
that
something
took
a
shot
at
dhurmsalla
or
sent
objects
upon
which
there
may
be
decipherable
markings
lights
were
seen
in
the
air
i
think
myself
of
a
number
of
things
beings
whatever
they
were
trying
to
get
down
but
resisted
like
balloonists
at
a
certain
altitude
trying
to
get
farther
up
but
resisted
not
in
the
least
except
to
good
positivists
or
the
does
this
speculation
interfere
with
the
concept
of
some
other
world
that
is
in
successful
communication
with
certain
esoteric
ones
upon
this
earth
by
a
code
of
symbols
that
print
in
rock
like
symbols
of
telephotographers
in
selenium
i
think
that
sometimes
in
favorable
circumstances
emissaries
have
come
to
this
earth
secret
meetings
of
course
it
sounds
but
secret
meetings
emissaries
esoteric
ones
in
europe
before
the
war
broke
out
and
those
who
suggested
that
such
phenomena
could
be
however
as
to
most
of
our
data
i
think
of
that
have
passed
close
to
this
earth
with
no
more
interest
in
this
earth
than
have
passengers
upon
a
steamship
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
or
passengers
may
have
a
keen
interest
but
circumstances
of
schedules
and
commercial
requirements
forbid
investigation
of
the
bottom
of
the
sea
then
on
the
other
hand
we
may
have
data
of
attempts
to
investigate
phenomena
of
this
earth
from
above
perhaps
by
beings
from
so
far
away
that
they
had
never
even
heard
that
something
somewhere
asserts
a
legal
right
to
this
earth
altogether
we
good
intermediatists
but
we
ca
be
very
good
hypnotists
still
another
source
of
the
merging
away
of
our
data
that
upon
general
principles
of
continuity
if
or
have
traversed
this
earth
atmosphere
there
must
be
mergers
between
them
and
terrestrial
phenomena
observations
upon
them
must
merge
away
into
observations
upon
clouds
and
balloons
and
meteors
we
shall
begin
with
data
that
we
can
not
distinguish
ourselves
and
work
our
way
out
of
mergers
into
extremes
in
the
it
is
said
that
according
to
a
newspaper
march
residents
of
warmley
england
were
greatly
excited
by
something
that
was
supposed
to
be
a
splendidly
illuminated
aeroplane
passing
over
the
village
the
machine
was
apparently
traveling
at
a
tremendous
rate
and
came
from
the
direction
of
bath
and
went
on
toward
gloucester
the
editor
says
that
it
was
a
large
fireball
tremendous
indeed
he
says
but
we
are
prepared
for
anything
nowadays
that
is
satisfactory
we
not
like
to
creep
up
stealthily
and
then
jump
out
of
a
corner
with
our
data
this
editor
at
least
is
prepared
to
read
a
correspondent
writes
that
in
the
county
wicklow
ireland
at
about
in
the
evening
he
had
seen
in
the
sky
an
object
that
looked
like
the
moon
in
its
aspect
we
note
the
shape
which
approximates
to
triangularity
and
we
note
that
in
color
it
is
said
to
have
been
golden
yellow
it
moved
slowly
and
in
about
five
minutes
disappeared
behind
a
mountain
the
editor
gives
his
opinion
that
the
object
may
have
been
an
escaped
balloon
in
there
is
a
story
taken
from
the
july
number
of
the
weather
by
the
meteorologist
payne
that
he
had
seen
in
the
canadian
sky
a
large
object
sailing
rapidly
at
first
he
supposed
that
the
object
was
a
balloon
its
outline
being
sharply
defined
but
as
no
cage
was
seen
it
was
concluded
that
it
must
be
a
mass
of
cloud
in
about
six
minutes
this
object
became
less
definite
whether
because
of
increasing
distance
or
not
the
mass
became
less
dense
and
finally
it
disappeared
as
to
cyclonic
formation
no
whirling
motion
could
be
seen
that
upon
july
a
correspondent
had
seen
at
kiel
an
object
in
the
sky
colored
red
by
the
sun
which
had
set
it
was
about
as
broad
as
a
rainbow
and
about
twelve
degrees
high
it
remained
in
its
original
brightness
about
five
minutes
and
then
faded
rapidly
and
then
remained
almost
stationary
again
finally
disappearing
about
eight
minutes
after
i
first
saw
it
in
an
intermediate
existence
we
have
nothing
to
judge
by
because
everything
is
its
own
opposite
if
a
hundred
dollars
a
week
be
a
standard
of
luxurious
living
to
some
persons
it
is
poverty
to
others
we
have
instances
of
three
objects
that
were
seen
in
the
sky
in
a
space
of
three
months
and
this
concurrence
seems
to
me
to
be
something
to
judge
by
science
has
been
built
upon
concurrence
so
have
been
most
of
the
fallacies
and
fanaticisms
i
feel
the
positivism
of
a
leverrier
or
instinctively
take
to
the
notion
that
all
three
of
these
observations
relate
to
the
same
object
however
i
do
formulate
them
and
predict
the
next
transit
here
another
chance
for
me
to
become
a
fixed
star
but
as
usual
oh
well
a
point
in
intermediatism
that
the
intermediatist
is
likely
to
be
a
flaccid
compromiser
our
own
attitude
ours
is
a
partly
positive
and
partly
negative
state
or
a
state
in
which
nothing
is
finally
positive
or
finally
negative
but
if
positivism
attract
you
go
ahead
and
try
you
will
be
in
harmony
with
cosmic
endeavor
but
continuity
will
resist
you
only
to
have
appearance
in
quasiness
is
to
be
proportionately
positive
but
beyond
a
degree
of
attempted
positivism
continuity
will
rise
to
pull
you
back
success
as
it
is
called
though
there
is
only
in
intermediateness
will
in
intermediateness
be
yours
proportionately
as
you
are
in
adjustment
with
its
own
state
or
some
positivism
mixed
with
compromise
and
retreat
to
be
very
positive
is
to
be
a
napoleon
bonaparte
against
whom
the
rest
of
civilization
will
sooner
or
later
combine
for
interesting
data
see
newspaper
accounts
of
fate
of
one
dowie
of
chicago
intermediatism
then
is
recognition
that
our
state
is
only
a
it
is
no
bar
to
one
who
desires
to
be
positive
it
is
recognition
that
he
can
not
be
positive
and
remain
in
a
state
that
is
or
that
a
great
positivist
isolated
with
no
system
to
support
him
will
be
crucified
or
will
starve
to
death
or
will
be
put
in
jail
and
beaten
to
death
that
these
are
the
of
translation
to
the
positive
absolute
so
though
myself
i
feel
the
attraction
of
the
positive
pole
of
our
intermediate
state
and
attempt
to
correlate
these
three
data
to
see
them
homogeneously
to
think
that
they
relate
to
one
object
in
the
aeronautic
journals
and
in
the
london
there
is
no
mention
of
escaped
balloons
in
the
summer
or
fall
of
in
the
york
there
is
no
mention
of
ballooning
in

or
the

in

of

a
clipping
from
the
of
bermuda
of
sent
to
the
by
general
lefroy
that
upon
at
about
there
was
observed
by
adelina
bassett
a
strange
object
in
the
clouds
coming
from
the
north
she
called
the
attention
of
lowell
to
it
and
they
were
both
somewhat
alarmed
however
they
continued
to
watch
the
object
steadily
for
some
time
it
drew
nearer
it
was
of
triangular
shape
and
seemed
to
be
about
the
size
of
a
mainsail
with
chains
attached
to
the
bottom
of
it
while
crossing
the
land
it
had
appeared
to
descend
but
as
it
went
out
to
sea
it
ascended
and
continued
to
ascend
until
it
was
lost
to
sight
high
in
the
clouds
or
with
such
power
to
ascend
i
do
think
much
myself
of
the
notion
that
it
was
an
escaped
balloon
partly
deflated
nevertheless
general
lefroy
correlating
with
exclusionism
attempts
to
give
a
terrestrial
interpretation
to
this
occurrence
he
argues
that
the
thing
may
have
been
a
balloon
that
had
escaped
from
france
or
england
or
the
only
aerial
thing
of
terrestrial
origin
that
even
to
this
date
of
about
years
later
has
been
thought
to
have
crossed
the
atlantic
ocean
he
accounts
for
the
triangular
form
by
deflation
a
shapeless
bag
barely
able
to
float
my
own
acceptance
is
that
great
deflation
does
not
accord
with
observations
upon
its
power
to
ascend
in
the
charles
harding
of
the
argues
that
if
it
had
been
a
balloon
from
europe
surely
it
would
have
been
seen
and
reported
by
many
vessels
whether
he
was
as
good
a
briton
as
the
general
or
not
he
shows
awareness
of
the
united
states
or
that
the
thing
may
have
been
a
partly
collapsed
balloon
that
had
escaped
from
the
united
states
general
lefroy
wrote
to
about
it
saying
whatever
his
sensitivenesses
may
have
been
that
the
columns
of
the
were
hardly
suitable
for
such
a
discussion
if
in
the
past
there
had
been
more
persons
like
general
lefroy
we
have
better
than
the
mere
fragments
of
data
that
in
most
cases
are
too
broken
up
very
well
to
piece
together
he
took
the
trouble
to
write
to
a
friend
of
his
gosling
of
bermuda
who
also
was
an
extraordinary
person
he
went
to
the
trouble
of
interviewing
bassett
and
lowell
their
description
to
him
was
somewhat
different
an
object
from
which
nets
were
suspended

with
its

hanging
from
it

was

gosling

that
the
item
of

suggestion
of
a
basket
that
had
been
attached
had
originated
with
bassett
who
had
not
seen
the
object
gosling
mentioned
a
balloon
that
had
escaped
from
paris
in
july
he
tells
of
a
balloon
that
fell
in
chicago

or
three
weeks
later
than
the
bermuda
object
it

incredibility
against
another

disregards
and

whichever
of
the
two
dominants
looms
stronger
in
each
reader
mind
that
he
ca
think
for
himself
any
more
than
i
can
is
understood
my
own
correlates
i
think
that
we
fished
for
it
may
be
that
we
highly
esteemed
by
somewhere
it
makes
me
more
cheerful
when
i
think
that
we
may
be
of
some
use
after
all
i
think
that
dragnets
have
often
come
down
and
have
been
mistaken
for
whirlwinds
and
waterspouts
some
accounts
of
seeming
structure
in
whirlwinds
and
waterspouts
are
astonishing
and
i
have
data
that
in
this
book
i
ca
take
up
at
all
mysterious
disappearances
i
think
we
fished
for
but
this
is
a
little
expression
on
the
side
relates
to
trespassers
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
that
i
shall
take
up
at
some
other

our
use

some
other

to
the

which
is
said
to
have
been

over

no
ascent
took

can

is
no

in

mention
of
two
ascents
in
france
both
balloons
had
escaped
in

it
is
said
that
these
balloons
had
been
sent
up
from
f√™tes
of
the
fourteenth
of
july
days
before
the
observation
at
bermuda
the
aeronauts
were
gower
and
eloy
gower
balloon
was
found
floating
on
the
ocean
but
eloy
balloon
was
not
found
upon
the
of
july
it
was
reported
by
a
sea
captain
still
in
the
air
still
inflated
but
this
balloon
of
eloy
was
a
small
exhibition
balloon
made
for
short
ascents
from
f√™tes
and
fair
grounds
in
it
is
said
that
it
was
a
very
small
balloon
incapable
of
remaining
long
in
the
air
as
to
contemporaneous
ballooning
in
the
united
states
i
find
only
one
account
an
ascent
in

leaving
this
balloon
the

had
pulled

the

were
thrown
into

charles
tilden
smith
writes
that
at
chisbury
wiltshire
england
april
he
saw
something
in
the
sky
unlike
anything
that
i
had
ever
seen
before
although
i
have
studied
the
skies
for
many
years
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
he
saw
two
stationary
dark
patches
upon
clouds
the
extraordinary
part
they
were
stationary
upon
clouds
that
were
rapidly
moving
they
were
or
triangular
and
varied
in
size
but
kept
the
same
position
upon
different
clouds
as
cloud
after
cloud
came
along
for
more
than
half
an
hour
smith
watched
these
dark
patches
his
impression
as
to
the
one
that
appeared
first
that
it
was
really
a
heavy
shadow
cast
upon
a
thin
veil
of
clouds
by
some
unseen
object
away
in
the
west
which
was
intercepting
the
rays
upon
page
of
this
volume
of
is
a
letter
from
another
correspondent
to
the
effect
that
similar
shadows
are
cast
by
mountains
upon
clouds
and
that
no
doubt
smith
was
right
in
attributing
the
appearance
to
some
unseen
object
which
was
intercepting
the
rays
but
the
old
dominant
that
was
a
jealous
dominant
and
the
wrath
of
the
old
dominant
against
such
an
irreconcilability
as
large
opaque
objects
in
the
sky
casting
down
shadows
upon
clouds
still
the
dominants
are
suave
very
often
or
are
not
absolute
gods
and
the
way
attention
was
led
away
from
this
subject
is
an
interesting
study

charles
cave
the
meteorologist
writes
that
upon
april
and
at
ditcham
park
petersfield
he
had
observed
a
similar
appearance
while
watching
some
pilot
balloons
but
he
describes
something
not
in
the
least
like
a
shadow
on
clouds
but
a
stationary
cloud
the
inference
seems
to
be
that
the
shadows
at
chisbury
may
have
been
shadows
of
pilot
balloons

upon

someone
else
carries
on
the
divergence
by
discussing
this
third
letter
then
someone
takes
up
the
third
letter
mathematically
and
then
there
is
a
correction
of
error
in
this
mathematic
demonstration
i
think
it
looks
very
much
like
what
i
think
it
looks
like
but
the
mystery
here
that
the
dark
patches
at
chisbury
could
not
have
been
cast
by
stationary
pilot
balloons
that
were
to
the
west
or
that
were
between
clouds
and
the
setting
sun
if
to
the
west
of
chisbury
a
stationary
object
were
high
in
the
air
intercepting
the
sun
rays
the
shadow
of
the
stationary
object
would
not
have
been
stationary
but
would
have
moved
higher
and
higher
with
the
setting
of
the
sun
i
have
to
think
of
something
that
is
in
accord
with
no
other
data
whatsoever
a
luminous
body
not
the
sun
in
the
sky
but
because
of
some
unknown
principle
or
atmospheric
condition
its
light
extended
down
only
about
to
the
clouds
that
from
it
were
suspended
two
triangular
objects
like
the
object
that
was
seen
in
bermuda
that
it
was
this
light
that
fell
short
of
the
earth
that
these
objects
intercepted
that
the
objects
were
drawn
up
and
lowered
from
something
overhead
so
that
in
its
light
their
shadows
changed
size
if
my
grope
seem
to
have
no
grasp
in
it
and
if
a
stationary
balloon
will
in
half
an
hour
not
cast
a
stationary
shadow
from
the
setting
sun
we
have
to
think
of
two
triangular
objects
that
accurately
maintained
positions
in
a
line
between
sun
and
clouds
and
at
the
same
time
approached
and
receded
from
clouds
whatever
it
may
have
been
enough
to
make
the
devout
make
the
sign
of
the
crucible
or
whatever
the
devotees
of
the
old
dominant
do
in
the
presence
of
a
new
correlate
vast
black
thing
poised
like
a
crow
over
the
moon
it
is
our
acceptance
that
these
two
shadows
of
chisbury
looked
from
the
moon
like
vast
things
black
as
crows
poised
over
the
earth
it
is
our
acceptance
that
two
triangular
luminosities
and
then
two
triangular
patches
like
vast
black
things
poised
like
crows
over
the
moon
and
like
the
triangularities
at
chisbury
have
been
seen
upon
or
over
the
moon

triangular
luminous
appearances
reported
by
several
observers
in
lebanon

approached

account
by
two
observers
of
a
faint
but
distinctly
triangular
object
visible
for
six
nights
in
the
sky
it
was
observed
from
two
stations
that
were
not
far
apart
but
the
parallax
was
considerable
whatever
it
was
it
was
acceptably
relatively
close
to
this
earth
i
should
say
that
relatively
to
phenomena
of
light
we
are
in
confusion
as
great
as
some
of
the
discords
that
orthodoxy
is
in
relatively
to
light
broadly
and
intermediatistically
our
position
is
that
light
is
not
really
and
necessarily
light
any
more
than
is
anything
else
really
and
necessarily
anything
but
an
interpretation
of
a
mode
of
force
as
i
suppose
we
have
to
call
it
as
light
at
sea
level
the
earth
atmosphere
interprets
sunlight
as
red
or
orange
or
yellow
high
up
on
mountains
the
sun
is
blue
very
high
up
on
mountains
the
zenith
is
black
or
it
is
orthodoxy
to
say
that
in
space
where
there
is
no
air
there
is
no
light
so
then
the
sun
and
comets
are
black
but
this
earth
atmosphere
or
rather
dust
particles
in
it
interpret
radiations
from
these
black
objects
as
light
we
look
up
at
the
moon
the
moon
is
so
silvery
white
i
have
about
fifty
notes
indicating
that
the
moon
has
atmosphere
nevertheless
most
astronomers
hold
out
that
the
moon
has
no
atmosphere
they
have
to
the
theory
of
eclipses
would
not
work
out
otherwise
so
arguing
in
conventional
terms
the
moon
is
black
rather
astonishing
explorers
upon
the
moon
stumbling
and
groping
in
intense
darkness
with
telescopes
powerful
enough
we
could
see
them
stumbling
and
groping
in
brilliant
light
or
just
because
of
familiarity
it
is
not
now
obvious
to
us
how
the
preposterousnesses
of
the
old
system
must
have
seemed
to
the
correlates
of
the
system
preceding
it
ye
silvery
moon
altogether
then
it
may
be
conceivable
that
there
are
phenomena
of
force
that
are
interpretable
as
light
as
far
down
as
the
clouds
but
not
in
denser
strata
of
air
or
just
the
opposite
of
familiar
interpretations
i
now
have
some
notes
upon
an
occurrence
that
suggests
a
force
not
interpreted
by
air
as
light
but
interpreted
or
reflected
by
the
ground
as
light
i
think
of
something
that
for
a
week
was
suspended
over
london
of
an
emanation
that
was
not
interpreted
as
light
until
it
reached
the
ground
june
that
every
night
for
a
week
a
light
had
appeared
in
woburn
square
london
upon
the
grass
of
a
small
park
enclosed
by
railings
crowds
gathering
police
called
out
for
the
special
service
of
maintaining
order
and
making
the
populace
move
on
the
editor
of
the
went
to
the
square
he
says
that
he
saw
nothing
but
a
patch
of
light
falling
upon
an
arbor
at
the
northeast
corner
of
the
enclosure
seems
to
me
that
that
was
interesting
enough
in
this
editor
we
have
a
companion
for
symons
and
gray
he
suggests
that
the
light
came
from
a
street
lamp
does
not
say
that
he
could
trace
it
to
any
such
origin
himself
but
recommends
that
the
police
investigate
neighboring
street
lamps
i
not
say
that
such
a
commonplace
as
light
from
a
street
lamp
would
not
attract
and
excite
and
deceive
great
crowds
for
a
week
but
i
do
accept
that
any
cop
who
was
called
upon
for
extra
work
would
have
needed
nobody
suggestion
to
settle
that
point
the
very
first
thing
or
that
something
in
the
sky
hung
suspended
over
a
london
square
for
a
week
seeing
so
many
meteorological
phenomena
in
your
excellent
paper
i
am
tempted
to
ask
for
an
explanation
of
the
following
which
i
saw
when
on
board
the
british
india
company
steamer
while
on
a
voyage
up
the
persian
gulf
in
may
on
a
dark
night
about
there
suddenly
appeared
on
each
side
of
the
ship
an
enormous
luminous
wheel
whirling
around
the
spokes
of
which
seemed
to
brush
the
ship
along
the
spokes
would
be
or
yards
long
and
resembled
the
birch
rods
of
the
dames
schools
each
wheel
contained
about
sixteen
spokes
and
although
the
wheels
must
have
been
some
or
yards
in
diameter
the
spokes
could
be
distinctly
seen
all
the
way
round
the
phosphorescent
gleam
seemed
to
glide
along
flat
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
no
light
being
visible
in
the
air
above
the
water
the
appearance
of
the
spokes
could
be
almost
exactly
represented
by
standing
in
a
boat
and
flashing
a
bull
eye
lantern
horizontally
along
the
surface
of
the
water
round
and
round
i
may
mention
that
the
phenomenon
was
also
seen
by
captain
avern
of
the
and
manning
third
officer
lee
fore
brace
the
wheels
advanced
along
with
the
ship
for
about
twenty
letter
from
mc
that
lee
fore
brace
who
sees
many
meteorological
phenomena
in
your
excellent
paper
should
have
signed
himself
modern
ezekiel
for
his
vision
of
wheels
is
quite
as
wonderful
as
the
prophet
the
writer
then
takes
up
the
measurements
that
were
given
and
calculates
a
velocity
at
the
circumference
of
a
wheel
of
about
yards
per
second
apparently
considering
that
especially
incredible
he
then
says
from
the
nom
de
plume
he
assumes
it
might
be
inferred
that
your
correspondent
is
in
the
habit
of
close
to
the
wind
he
asks
permission
to
suggest
an
explanation
of
his
own
it
is
that
before
there
had
been
numerous
accidents
to
the
main
brace
and
that
it
had
required
splicing
so
often
that
almost
any
ray
of
light
would
have
taken
on
a
rotary
motion
in
brace
answers
and
signs
himself
robertson
i
do
suppose
mc
means
any
harm
but
i
do
think
it
rather
unjust
to
say
a
man
is
drunk
because
he
sees
something
out
of
the
common
if
there
one
thing
i
pride
myself
upon
it
being
able
to
say
that
never
in
my
life
have
i
indulged
in
anything
stronger
than
water
from
this
curiosity
of
pride
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
had
not
intended
to
be
exact
but
to
give
his
impressions
of
dimensions
and
velocity
he
ends
amiably
however
offense
taken
where
i
suppose
none
is
meant
to
this
letter
proctor
adds
a
note
apologizing
for
the
publication
of
mc
d
letter
which
had
come
about
by
a
misunderstood
instruction
then
proctor
wrote
disagreeable
letters
himself
about
other
persons
what
else
would
you
expect
in
a
the
obvious
explanation
of
this
phenomenon
is
that
under
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
the
persian
gulf
was
a
vast
luminous
wheel
that
it
was
the
light
from
its
submerged
spokes
that
robertson
saw
shining
upward
it
seems
clear
that
this
light
did
shine
upward
from
origin
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
but
at
first
it
is
not
so
clear
how
vast
luminous
wheels
each
the
size
of
a
village
ever
got
under
the
surface
of
the
persian
gulf
also
there
may
be
some
misunderstanding
as
to
what
they
were
doing
there
a
fish
and
its
adaptation
to
a
dense
medium
that
at
least
in
some
regions
aloft
there
is
a
medium
dense
even
to
gelatinousness
a
fish
brought
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
in
a
relatively
attenuated
medium
it
disintegrates
adapted
to
a
dense
medium
in
space
sometimes
by
stresses
of
various
kinds
they
are
driven
into
this
earth
thin
atmosphere
later
we
shall
have
data
to
support
just
this
that
things
entering
this
earth
atmosphere
disintegrate
and
shine
with
a
light
that
is
not
the
light
of
incandescence
shine
brilliantly
even
if
cold
vast
they
enter
this
earth
atmosphere
and
threatened
with
disintegration
plunge
for
relief
into
an
ocean
or
into
a
denser
medium
of
course
the
requirements
now
facing
us
are
not
only
data
of
vast
that
have
relieved
their
distresses
in
the
ocean
but
data
of
enormous
wheels
that
have
been
seen
in
the
air
or
entering
the
ocean
or
rising
from
the
ocean
and
continuing
their
voyages
very
largely
we
shall
concern
ourselves
with
enormous
fiery
objects
that
have
either
plunged
into
the
ocean
or
risen
from
the
ocean
our
acceptance
is
that
though
disruption
may
intensify
into
incandescence
apart
from
disruption
and
its
probable
fieriness
things
that
enter
this
earth
atmosphere
have
a
cold
light
which
would
not
like
light
from
molten
matter
be
instantly
quenched
by
water
also
it
seems
acceptable
that
a
revolving
wheel
would
from
a
distance
look
like
a
globe
that
a
revolving
wheel
seen
relatively
close
by
looks
like
a
wheel
in
few
aspects
the
mergers
of
and
meteorites
are
not
resistances
to
us
our
data
are
of
enormous
bodies
so
we
shall
interpret
and
what
does
it
matter
our
attitude
throughout
this
book
that
here
are
extraordinary
data
that
they
never
would
be
exhumed
and
never
would
be
massed
together
unless
here
are
the
data
our
first
datum
is
of
something
that
was
once
seen
to
enter
an
ocean
it
from
the
puritanic
publication
which
has
yielded
us
little
material
or
which
like
most
puritans
does
not
go
upon
a
spree
very
often
whatever
the
thing
could
have
been
my
impression
is
of
tremendousness
or
of
bulk
many
times
that
of
all
meteorites
in
all
museums
combined
also
of
relative
slowness
or
of
long
warning
of
approach
the
story
in
is
from
an
account
sent
to
the
hydrographic
office
at
washington
from
the
branch
office
at
san
francisco
that
at
midnight
lat
and
long
or
somewhere
between
yokohama
and
victoria
the
captain
of
the
bark
was
aroused
by
his
mate
who
had
seen
something
unusual
in
the
sky
this
must
have
taken
appreciable
time
the
captain
went
on
deck
and
saw
the
sky
turning
fiery
red
all
at
once
a
large
mass
of
fire
appeared
over
the
vessel
completely
blinding
the
spectators
the
fiery
mass
fell
into
the
sea
its
size
may
be
judged
by
the
volume
of
water
cast
up
by
it
said
to
have
rushed
toward
the
vessel
with
a
noise
that
was
deafening
the
bark
was
struck
flat
aback
and
a
roaring
white
sea
passed
ahead
the
master
an
old
experienced
mariner
declared
that
the
awfulness
of
the
sight
was
beyond
description
in
and
we
are
told
that
an
object
described
as
a
large
ball
of
fire
was
seen
to
rise
from
the
sea
near
cape
race
we
are
told
that
it
rose
to
a
height
of
fifty
feet
and
then
advanced
close
to
the
ship
then
moving
away
remaining
visible
about
five
minutes
the
supposition
in
is
that
it
was
ball
lightning
but
flammarion
and
says
that
it
was
enormous
details
in
the
american
british
steamer
that
the
object
had
moved
against
the
wind
before
retreating
that
captain
moore
said
that
at
about
the
same
place
he
had
seen
such
appearances
before
of
the
british
that
upon
june
according
to
the
from
the
brig
about
miles
east
of
adalia
asia
minor
n
lat
e
long
three
luminous
bodies
were
seen
to
issue
from
the
sea
at
about
half
a
mile
from
the
vessel
they
were
visible
about
ten
minutes
the
story
was
never
investigated
but
other
accounts
that
seem
acceptably
to
be
other
observations
upon
this
same
sensational
spectacle
came
in
as
if
of
their
own
accord
and
were
published
by
one
is
a
letter
from
a
correspondent
at
mt
lebanon
he
describes
only
two
luminous
bodies
apparently
they
were
five
times
the
size
of
the
moon
each
had
appendages
or
they
were
connected
by
parts
that
are
described
as
or
looking
like
large
flags
blown
out
by
a
gentle
breeze
the
important
point
here
is
not
only
suggestion
of
structure
but
duration
the
duration
of
meteors
is
a
few
seconds
duration
of
fifteen
seconds
is
remarkable
but
i
think
there
are
records
up
to
half
a
minute
this
object
if
it
were
all
one
object
was
visible
at
mt
lebanon
about
one
hour
an
interesting
circumstance
is
that
the
appendages
did
not
look
like
trains
of
meteors
which
shine
by
their
own
light
but
seemed
to
shine
by
light
from
the
main
bodies
about
miles
west
of
the
position
of
the
is
the
town
of
adalia
asia
minor
at
about
the
time
of
the
observation
reported
by
the
captain
of
the
the
rev
hawlett
was
in
adalia
he
too
saw
this
spectacle
and
sent
an
account
to
in
his
view
it
was
a
body
that
appeared
and
then
broke
up
he
places
duration
at
twenty
minutes
to
half
an
hour
in
the
of
the
british
the
phenomenon
was
reported
from
syria
and
malta
as
two
very
large
bodies
nearly
joined
brit
that
at
cherbourg
france
was
seen
a
luminous
body
seemingly
the
size
of
the
moon
it
seemed
to
rotate
on
an
axis
central
to
it
there
seemed
to
be
a
dark
cavity
for
other
accounts
all
indefinite
but
distortable
into
data
of
objects
in
the
sky
see

that
upon
the
morning
of
an
appearance
in
the

was
seen
by
many
persons
in
virginia
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
a
luminous
body
passed
overhead
from
west
to
east
until
at
about
degrees
in
the
eastern
horizon
it
appeared
to
stand
still
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
according
to
some
descriptions
it
was
the
size
of
a
table
to
some
observers
it
looked
like
an
enormous
wheel
the
light
was
a
brilliant
white
acceptably
it
was
not
an
optical
illusion
the
noise
of
its
passage
through
the
air
was
heard
having
been
stationary
or
having
seemed
to
stand

or
twenty
minutes

i
should
say
that

is

reprint
of
a
letter
from
harris
commander
of
the
steamship
to
the
calcutta
that
upon
the
of
june
off
the
coast
of
malabar
at
water
calm
sky
cloudless
he
had
seen
something
that
was
so
foreign
to
anything
that
he
had
ever
seen
before
that
he
had
stopped
his
ship
he
saw
what
he
describes
as
waves
of
brilliant
light
with
spaces
between
upon
the
water
were
floating
patches
of
a
substance
that
was
not
identified
thinking
in
terms
of
the
conventional
explanation
of
all
phosphorescence
at
sea
the
captain
at
first
suspected
this
substance
however
he
gives
his
opinion
that
it
did
no
illuminating
but
was
with
the
rest
of
the
sea
illuminated
by
tremendous
shafts
of
light
whether
it
was
a
thick
and
oily
discharge
from
the
engine
of
a
submerged
construction
or
not
i
think
that
i
shall
have
to
accept
this
substance
as
a
concomitant
because
of
another
note
as
wave
succeeded
wave

of
the
most
grand
and
brilliant
yet
solemn
spectacles

we
witnessed
a
weird
and
most
extraordinary
electric
display
in
the
gulf
of
oman
he
saw
a
bank
of
apparently
quiescent
phosphorescence
but
when
within
twenty
yards
of
it
shafts
of
brilliant
light
came
sweeping
across
the
ship
bows
at
a
prodigious
speed
which
might
be
put
down
as
anything
between
and
miles
an
hour
these
light
bars
were
about
feet
apart
and
most
regular
as
to
phosphorescence
i
collected
a
bucketful
of
water
and
examined
it
under
the
microscope
but
could
not
detect
anything
abnormal
that
the
shafts
of
light
came
up
from
something
beneath
the
surface
they
first
struck
us
on
our
broadside
and

noticed

this
is
the
only
instance
we
have
out
of
oriental
waters
that
in
the
meteorological
published
by
the
danish
meteorological
institute
appears
a
report
upon
a
singular
phenomenon
that
was
seen
by
capt
gabe
of
the
danish
east
asiatic
steamship
at
june
while
sailing
through
the
straits
of
malacca
captain
gabe
saw
a
vast
revolving
wheel
of
light
flat
upon
the
water
long
arms
issuing
from
a
center
around
which
the
whole
system
appeared
to
rotate

vast
was
the
appearance
that
only
half
of
it
could
be
seen
at
a
time
the
center
lying
near
the
horizon
this
display
lasted
about
fifteen
minutes
heretofore
we
have
not
been
clear
upon
the
important
point
that
forward
motions
of
these
wheels
do
not
synchronize
with
a
vessel
motions
and
freaks
of
disregard
or
rather
commonplaces
of
disregard
might
attempt
to
assimilate
with
lights
of
a
vessel
this
time
we
are
told
that
the
vast
wheel
moved
forward
decreasing
in
brilliancy
and
also
in
speed
of
rotation
disappearing
when
the
center
was
right
ahead
of
the
vessel
or
my
own
interpretation
would
be
that
the
source
of
light
was
submerging
deeper
and
deeper
and
slowing
down
because
meeting
more
and
more
resistance
the
danish
meteorological
institute
reports
another
instance
that
when
capt
breyer
of
the
dutch
steamer
was
in
the
south
china
sea
midnight
he
saw
a
rotation
of
flashes
it
looked
like
a
horizontal
wheel
turning
rapidly
this
time
it
is
said
that
the
appearance
was
above
water
the
phenomenon
was
observed
by
the
captain
the
first
and
second
mates
and
the
first
engineer
and
upon
all
of
them
it
made
a
somewhat
uncomfortable
impression
in
general
if
our
expression
be
not
immediately
acceptable
we
recommend
to
rival
interpreters
that
they
consider
the
localization
with
one
exception
of
this
phenomenon
to
the
indian
ocean
and
adjacent
waters
or
persian
gulf
on
one
side
and
china
sea
on
the
other
side
though
intermediatists
the
call
of
attempted
positivism
in
the
aspect
of
completeness
is
irresistible
we
have
expressed
that
from
few
aspects
would
wheels
of
fire
in
the
air
look
like
wheels
of
fire
but
if
we
can
get
it
we
must
have
observation
upon
vast
luminous
wheels
not
interpretable
as
optical
illusions
but
enormous
substantial
things
that
have
smashed
down
material
resistances
and
have
been
seen
to
plunge
into
the
ocean
that
at
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
sir
harris
said
that
he
had
recorded
an
account
sent
to
him
of
a
vessel
toward
which
had
whirled
two
wheels
of
fire
which
the
men
described
as
rolling
millstones
of
fire
when
they
came
near
an
awful
crash
took
place
the
topmasts
were
shivered
to
pieces
it
is
said
that
there
was
a
strong
sulphurous
odor
of
the
royal
meteorological
extract
from
the
log
of
the
bark
of
the
by
capt
banner
communicated
by
scott
that
upon
the
of
march
at
lat
long
the
sailors
of
the
of
the
saw
a
remarkable
object
or
cloud
in
the
sky
they
reported
to
the
captain
according
to
capt
banner
it
was
a
cloud
of
circular
form
with
an
included
divided
into
four
parts
the
central
dividing
shaft
beginning
at
the
center
of
the
circle
and
extending
far
outward
and
then
curving
backward
geometricity
and
complexity
and
stability
of
form
and
the
small
likelihood
of
a
cloud
maintaining
such
diversity
of
features
to
say
nothing
of
appearance
of
organic
form
the
thing
traveled
from
a
point
at
about
degrees
above
the
horizon
to
a
point
about
degrees
above
then
it
settled
down
to
the
northeast
having
appeared
from
the
south
southeast
light
gray
in
color
or
it
was
it
was
much
lower
than
the
other
clouds
and
this
datum
stands
out
that
whatever
it
may
have
been
it
traveled
against
the
wind
it
came
up
obliquely
against
the
wind
and
finally
settled
down
right
in
the
wind
eye
for
half
an
hour
this
form
was
visible
when
it
did
finally
disappear
that
was
not
because
it
disintegrated
like
a
cloud
but
because
it
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
evening
darkness
capt
banner
draws
the
following
diagram
illustration
tell
us
that
the
dhurmsalla
meteorites
were
picked
up
soon
or
within
half
an
hour
given
a
little
time
the
conventionalists
may
argue
that
these
stones
were
hot
when
they
fell
but
that
their
great
interior
coldness
had
overcome
the
molten
state
of
their
surfaces
according
to
the
deputy
commissioner
of
dhurmsalla
these
stones
had
been
picked
up
immediately
by
passing
coolies
these
stones
were
so
cold
that
they
benumbed
the
fingers
but
they
had
fallen
with
a
great
light
it
is
described
as
a
flame
of
fire
about
two
feet
in
depth
and
nine
feet
in
length
acceptably
this
light
was
not
the
light
of
molten
matter
in
this
chapter
we
are
very
intermediatistic
and
unsatisfactory
to
the
intermediatist
there
is
but
one
answer
to
all
questions
sometimes
and
sometimes
not
another
form
of
this
intermediatist
solution
of
all
problems
is
yes
and
no
everything
that
is
also
is
a
positivist
attempts
to
formulate
so
does
the
intermediatist
but
with
less
rigorousness
he
accepts
but
also
denies
he
may
seem
to
accept
in
one
respect
and
deny
in
some
other
respect
but
no
real
line
can
be
drawn
between
any
two
aspects
of
anything
the
intermediatist
accepts
that
which
seems
to
correlate
with
something
that
he
has
accepted
as
a
dominant
the
positivist
correlates
with
a
belief
in
the
dhurmsalla
meteorites
we
have
support
for
our
expression
that
things
entering
this
earth
atmosphere
sometimes
shine
with
a
light
that
is
not
the
light
of
incandescence
or
so
we
account
or
offer
an
expression
upon
thunderstones
or
carved
stones
that
have
fallen
luminously
to
this
earth
in
streaks
that
have
looked
like
strokes
of
lightning
but
we
accept
also
that
some
things
that
have
entered
this
earth
atmosphere
disintegrate
with
the
intensity
of
flame
and
molten
matter
but
some
things
we
accept
enter
this
earth
atmosphere
and
collapse
quite
like
fishes
brought
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
whatever
agreement
we
have
is
an
indication
that
somewhere
aloft
there
is
a
medium
denser
than
this
earth
atmosphere
i
suppose
our
stronghold
is
in
that
such
is
not
popular
belief
or
the
rhythm
of
all
phenomena
air
dense
at
sea
level
upon
this
earth
less
and
less
dense
as
one
ascends
then
denser
and
denser
a
good
many
bothersome
questions
arise
our
attitude
here
are
the
data
luminous
rains
sometimes
fall
march
this
is
light
that
is
not
the
light
of
incandescence
but
no
one
can
say
that
these
occasional
or
rare
rains
come
from
this
earth
externality
we
simply
note
cold
light
of
falling
bodies
for
luminous
rain
snow
and
dust
see
hartwig
as
to
luminous
clouds
we
have
more
nearly
definite
observations
and
opinions
they
mark
transition
between
the
old
dominant
and
the
new
dominant
we
have
already
noted
the
transition
in
schwedoffs
theory
of
external
origin
of
some
hailstones
and
the
implications
that
to
a
former
generation
seemed
so
preposterous
droll
was
the
word
that
there
are
in
regions
volumes
of
water
whether
they
have
fishes
and
frogs
in
them
or
not
now
our
acceptance
is
that
clouds
sometimes
come
from
external
regions
having
had
origin
from
lakes
and
oceans
that
we
shall
not
attempt
to
chart
just
at
present
only
suggesting
to
enterprising
aviators
and
we
note
that
we
put
it
all
up
to
them
and
show
no
inclination
to
go
columbusing
on
our
own
account
that
they
take
bathing
suits
or
rather
along
so
then
that
some
clouds
come
from
oceans
of
the
sea
if
we
still
accept
the
sea
and
shine
upon
entering
this
atmosphere
in
und
february
a
phenomenon
of
transition
of
thirty
years
ago
herr
jesse
in
his
observations
upon
luminous
notes
the
great
height
of
them
and
drolly
or
sensibly
suggests
that
some
of
them
may
have
come
from
regions
external
to
this
earth
i
suppose
he
means
only
from
other
planets
but
it
a
very
droll
and
sensible
idea
either
way
in
general
i
am
accounting
for
a
great
deal
of
this
earth
isolation
that
it
is
relatively
isolated
by
circumstances
that
are
similar
to
the
circumstances
that
make
for
relative
isolation
of
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
except
that
there
is
a
clumsiness
of
analogy
now
to
call
ourselves
fishes
has
been
convenient
but
in
a
there
is
no
convenience
that
will
not
sooner
or
later
turn
awkward
so
if
there
be
denser
regions
aloft
these
regions
should
now
be
regarded
as
analogues
of
oceanic
regions
and
things
coming
to
this
earth
would
be
like
things
rising
to
an
attenuated
medium
and
exploding
sometimes
incandescently
sometimes
with
cold
light
sometimes
like
fishes
brought
to
the
surface
altogether
conditions
of
inhospitality
i
have
a
suspicion
that
in
their
own
depths
fishes
are
not
luminous
if
they
are
darwinism
is
mere
jesuitism
in
attempting
to
correlate
them
such
advertising
would
so
attract
attention
that
all
advantages
would
be
more
than
offset
darwinism
is
largely
a
doctrine
of
concealment
here
we
have
brazen
proclamation
if
accepted
fishes
in
the
mammoth
cave
need
no
light
to
see
by
we
might
have
an
expression
that
fishes
turn
luminous
upon
entering
a
less
dense
medium
but
models
in
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
specialized
organs
of
luminosity
upon
these
models
of
course
we
do
remember
that
awfully
convincing
dodo
and
some
of
our
sophistications
we
trace
to
him
at
any
rate
disruption
is
regarded
as
a
phenomenon
of
coming
from
a
dense
to
a
less
dense
medium
an
account
by
acharius
in
the
of
the
swedish
academy
of
translated
for
the
american
that
acharius
having
heard
of
an
extraordinary
and
probably
hitherto
unseen
phenomenon
reported
from
near
the
town
of
skeninge
sweden
investigated
that
upon
the
of
may
at
about
the
sun
suddenly
turned
dull
at
the
same
time
there
appeared
upon
the
western
horizon
a
great
number
of
round
bodies
dark
brown
and
seemingly
the
size
of
a
hat
crown
they
passed
overhead
and
disappeared
in
the
eastern
horizon
tremendous
procession
it
lasted
two
hours
occasionally
one
fell
to
the
ground
when
the
place
of
a
fall
was
examined
there
was
found
a
film
which
soon
dried
and
vanished
often
when
approaching
the
sun
these
bodies
seemed
to
link
together
or
were
then
seen
to
be
linked
together
in
groups
not
exceeding
eight
and
under
the
sun
they
were
seen
to
have
tails
three
or
four
fathoms
long
away
from
the
sun
the
tails
were
invisible
whatever
their
substance
may
have
been
it
is
described
as
gelatinous
soapy
and
jellied
i
place
this
datum
here
for
several
reasons
it
would
have
been
a
good
climax
to
our
expression
upon
hordes
of
small
bodies
that
in
our
acceptance
were
not
seeds
nor
birds
nor
but
the
tendency
would
have
been
to
jump
to
the
homogeneous
conclusion
that
all
our
data
in
that
expression
related
to
this
one
kind
of
phenomena
whereas
we
conceive
of
infinite
heterogeneity
of
the
external
of
crusaders
and
rabbles
and
emigrants
and
tourists
and
dragons
and
things
like
gelatinous
hat
crowns
or
that
all
things
here
upon
this
earth
that
flock
together
are
not
necessarily
sheep
presbyterians
gangsters
or
porpoises
the
datum
is
important
to
us
here
as
indication
of
disruption
in
this
earth
atmosphere
dangers
in
entering
this
earth
atmosphere
i
think
myself
that
thousands
of
objects
have
been
seen
to
fall
from
aloft
and
have
exploded
luminously
and
have
been
called
ball
lightning
as
to
what
ball
lightning
is
we
have
not
yet
begun
to
make
intelligent
guesses
weather
in
general
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
encounter
the
opposition
ball
lightning
we
should
pay
little
attention
but
confine
ourselves
to
guesses
that
are
at
least
intelligent
that
stand
in
our
way
we
note
here
that
in
some
of
our
acceptances
upon
intelligence
we
should
more
clearly
have
pointed
out
that
they
were
upon
the
intelligent
as
opposed
to
the
instinctive
in
the
weather
there
is
an
account
of
ball
lightning
that
struck
a
tree
it
made
a
dent
such
as
a
falling
object
would
make
some
other
time
i
shall
collect
instances
of
ball
lightning
to
express
that
they
are
instances
of
objects
that
have
fallen
from
the
sky
luminously
exploding
terrifically
so
bewildered
is
the
old
orthodoxy
by
these
phenomena
that
many
scientists
have
either
denied
ball
lightning
or
have
considered
it
very
doubtful
i
refer
to
sestier
list
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
instances
which
he
considered
authentic
in
accord
with
our
disaccord
is
an
instance
related
in
the
weather
march
something
that
fell
luminously
from
the
sky
accompanied
by
something
that
was
not
so
affected
or
that
was
dark
that
according
to
capt
sweet
of
the
dutch
bark
upon
march
he
encountered
a
severe
storm
he
saw
two
objects
in
the
air
above
the
ship
one
was
luminous
and
might
be
explained
in
several
ways
but
the
other
was
dark
one
or
both
fell
into
the
sea
with
a
roar
and
the
casting
up
of
billows
it
is
our
acceptance
that
these
things
had
entered
this
earth
atmosphere
having
first
crashed
through
a
field
of
ice
immediately
afterward
lumps
of
ice
fell
one
of
the
most
astonishing
of
the
phenomena
of
ball
lightning
is
a
phenomenon
of
many
meteorites
violence
of
explosion
out
of
all
proportion
to
size
and
velocity
we
accept
that
the
icy
meteorites
of
dhurmsalla
could
have
fallen
with
no
great
velocity
but
the
sound
from
them
was
tremendous
the
soft
substance
that
fell
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
carbonaceous
but
was
unburned
or
had
fallen
with
velocity
insufficient
to
ignite
it
the
tremendous
report
that
it
made
was
heard
over
an
area
more
than
seventy
miles
in
diameter
that
some
hailstones
have
been
formed
in
a
dense
medium
and
violently
disintegrate
in
this
earth
relatively
thin
atmosphere
large
hailstones
noted
at
the
university
of
missouri
they
exploded
with
sounds
like
pistol
shots
the
writer
says
that
he
had
noticed
a
similar
phenomenon
eighteen
years
before
at
lexington
kentucky
hailstones
that
seemed
to
have
been
formed
in
a
denser
medium
when
melted
under
water
they
gave
out
bubbles
larger
than
their
central
air
spaces
weather
our
acceptance
is
that
many
objects
have
fallen
from
the
sky
but
that
many
of
them
have
disintegrated
violently
this
acceptance
will
with
data
still
to
come
but
also
we
make
it
easy
for
ourselves
in
our
expressions
upon
if
we
asked
why
from
thinkable
wrecks
of
them
girders
plates
or
parts
recognizably
of
manufactured
metal
have
not
fallen
from
the
sky
however
as
to
composition
we
have
not
this
refuge
so
it
is
our
expression
that
there
have
been
reported
instances
of
the
fall
of
manufactured
metal
from
the
sky
the
meteorite
of
rutherford
north
carolina
is
of
artificial
material
mass
of
pig

it
is
said
to
be
fraudulent

the
object
that
was
said
to
have
fallen
at

in
is
described
in
the
jour
as
a
furnace
product
formed
in
smelting
copper
ores
or
iron
ores
containing
copper
it
is
said
to
be
fraudulent
according
to
ehrenberg
the
substance
reported
by
capt
callam
to
have
fallen
upon
his
vessel
near
java
offered
complete
resemblance
to
the
residue
resulting
from
combustion
of
a
steel
wire
in
a
flask
of
oxygen
zurcher
p
publishes
a
notice
that
according
to
the
a
meteorite
that
resembles
steel
had
been
found
in
the
mohave
desert
in
we
read
that
one
of
the
meteorites
brought
to
the
united
states
by
peary
from
greenland
is
of
tempered
steel
the
opinion
is
that
meteoric
iron
had
fallen
in
water
or
snow
quickly
cooling
and
hardening
this
does
not
apply
to
composition
publishes
a
notice
of
a
paper
by
berwerth
of
vienna
upon
the
close
connection
between
meteoric
iron
and
steel
at
the
meeting
of
of
the
essex
field
club
was
exhibited
a
piece
of
metal
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
at
braintree
according
to
the
fletcher
of
the
british
museum
had
declared
this
metal
to
be
smelted
iron
so
that
the
mystery
of
its
reported
remained
unexplained
we
shall
have
an
outcry
of
silences
if
a
single
instance
of
anything
be
disregarded
by
a
system
our
own
attitude
is
that
a
single
instance
is
a
powerless
thing
of
course
our
own
method
of
agreement
of
many
instances
is
not
a
real
method
in
continuity
all
things
must
have
resemblances
with
all
other
things
anything
has
any
you
please
some
time
ago
conscription
was
assimilated
with
either
autocracy
or
democracy
with
equal
facility
note
the
need
for
a
dominant
to
correlate
to
scarcely
anybody
said
simply
that
we
must
have
conscription
but
that
we
must
have
conscription
which
correlates
with
democracy
which
was
taken
as
a
base
or
something
basically
desirable
of
course
between
autocracy
and
democracy
nothing
but
false
demarcation
can
be
drawn
so
i
can
conceive
of
no
subject
upon
which
there
should
be
such
poverty
as
a

than
the

who
advance
concealing

as

then
drag
in

too
as

i
think
the

had
better
come

be
sorry

i
suppose
it

now
to
come
of

that
have
been

in

and
to
think
that
all
have
been

my
own
opinion
is
that
it
is
not
possible
or
very
easy
to
disregard
them
now
that
they
have
been
brought
together

that
if
prior
to
about
this

we
had
attempted
such
an

that
with

away
the
last
of
our
susceptibility
to
the
common
fallacy
of
personifying
it
is
one
of
the
most
of
positivist
illusions
that
people
are
persons
we
have
been
guilty
too
often
of
spleens
and
spites
and
ridicules
against
astronomers
as
if
they
were
persons
or
final
unities
individuals
completenesses
or
selves
instead
of
indeterminate
parts
but
so
long
as
we
remain
in
we
can
cast
out
illusion
only
with
some
other
illusion
though
the
other
illusion
may
approximate
higher
to
reality
so
we
personify
no
more
but
we
we
now
take
into
full
acceptance
our
expression
that
development
is
an
autocracy
of
successive
dominants
which
are
not
final
but
which
approximate
higher
to
individuality
or
than
do
the
human
tropisms
that
irresponsibly
correlate
to
them
eddie
reported
a
celestial
object
from
the

at

south
africa
it

in
the
new

was
only
heir
presumptive
then
or
heir
apparent
but
not
obvious
the
thing
that
eddie
reported
might
as
well
have
been
reported
by
a
night
watchman
who
had
looked
up
through
an
unplaced
sewer
pipe
it
did
not

the
thing
was
not
admitted
to
i
think
myself
that
if
the
editor
had
attempted
to
let
it
in
earthquake
or
a
mysterious
fire
in
his
publishing
house
the
dominants
are
jealous
gods
in
presumably
a
vassal
of
the
new
god
though
of
course
also
plausibly
rendering
homage
to
the
old
is
reported
a
body
of
observed
at
grahamstown
by
eddie
it
may
have
looked
but
it
moved

see

describes
a
similar
appearance
that
he
had

dreyer
says
that
he
had
seen
this
object
at
the
armagh
observatory
he
likens
it
to
the
object
that
was
reported
by
eddie
it
was
seen
by
alexander
graham
bell
in
nova
scotia
but
the
old
dominant
was
a
jealous
god
so
there
were
different
observations
upon
something
that
was
seen
in
november
these
observations
were
philistines
in
in
the
met
a
correspondent
reports
having
seen
an
object
like
a
comet
with
two
tails
one
up
and
one
down
or
very
likely
this
phenomenon
should
be
placed
in
our
expression
upon
bodies
that
have
been
seen
in
the
sky
our
data
upon
dirigibles
or
but
our
attempted
classifications
are
far
from
rigorous
or
are
mere
gropes
in
the
a
correspondent
writes
from
humacao
porto
rico
that
he
and
several
other
persons
or
persons
as
it
were
had
seen
a
majestic
appearance
like
a
comet
visible
three
successive
nights
disappeared
then
the
editor
says
that
he
can
offer
no
explanation
if
accepted
this
thing
must
have
been
close
to
the
earth
if
it
had
been
a
comet
it
would
have
been
seen
widely
and
the
news
would
have
been
telegraphed
over
the
world
says
the
editor
upon
page
of
this
volume
of
the
a
correspondent
writes
that
at
sulphur
springs
ohio
he
had
seen
a
wonder
in
the
sky
at
about
the
same
date
it
was
or
something
with
a
nucleus
at
each
end
of
which
was
a
tail
again
the
editor
says
that
he
can
offer
no
explanation
that
the
object
was
not
a
comet
he
associates
it
with
the
atmospheric
effects
general
in
but
it
will
be
our
expression
that
in
england
and
holland
a
similar
object
was
seen
in
november
in
the
is
published
a
letter
from
henry
harrison
of
jersey
city
copied
from
the
york
that
upon
the
evening
of
april
harrison
was
searching
for
comet
when
he
saw
an
object
that
was
moving
so
rapidly
that
it
could
not
have
been
a
comet
he
called
a
friend
to
look
and
his
observation
was
confirmed
at
two
in
the
morning
this
object
was
still
visible
in
the
american
harrison
disclaims
sensationalism
which
he
seems
to
think
unworthy
and
gives
technical
details
he
says
that
the
object
was
seen
by
spencer
devoe
of
manhattanville
a
formation
having
the
shape
of
a
dirigible
it
was
reported
from
huntington
west
virginia
luminous
object
that
was
seen
july
at
about
observed
through
rather
powerful
field
glasses
it
looked
to
be
about
two
degrees
long
and
half
a
degree
wide
it
gradually
dimmed
disappeared
reappeared
and
then
faded
out
of
sight
another
person
as
we
say
it
would
be
too
inconvenient
to
hold
to
our
intermediatist
recognitions
another
person
who
observed
this
phenomenon
suggested
to
the
writer
of
the
account
that
the
object
was
a
dirigible
but
the
writer
says
that
faint
stars
could
be
seen
behind
it
this
would
seem
really
to
oppose
our
notion
of
a
dirigible
visitor
to
this
earth
except
for
the
inconclusiveness
of
all
things
in
a
mode
of
seeming
that
is
not
final
or
we
suggest
that
behind
some
parts
of
the
object
thing
construction
faint
stars
were
seen
we
find
a
slight
discussion
here
russell
thinks
that
the
phenomenon
was
a
detached
cloud
of
aurora
borealis
upon
page
of
this
volume
of
the
another
correlator
suggests
that
it
was
a
light
from
a
blast
furnace
disregarding
that
if
there
be
blast
furnaces
in
or
near
huntington
their
reflections
would
be
commonplaces
there
we
now
have
several
observations
upon
bodies
that
have
appeared
in
this
earth
atmosphere
cylindrical
but
pointed
at
both
ends
or
some
of
the
accounts
are
not
very
detailed
but
out
of
the
bits
of
description
my
own
acceptance
is
that
routes
are
traversed
by
that
have
occasionally
visited
or
that
have
occasionally
been
driven
into
this
earth
atmosphere
from
data
the
acceptance
is
that
upon
entering
this
earth
atmosphere
these
vessels
have
been
so
racked
that
had
they
not
sailed
away
disintegration
would
have
occurred
that
before
leaving
this
earth
they
have
whether
in
attempted
communication
or
not
or
in
mere
wantonness
or
not
dropped
objects
which
did
almost
immediately
violently
disintegrate
or
explode
upon
general
principles
we
think
that
explosives
have
not
been
purposely
dropped
but
that
parts
have
been
racked
off
and
have
fallen
exploding
like
the
things
called
ball
lightning
many
have
been
objects
of
stone
or
metal
with
inscriptions
upon
them
for
all
we
know
at
present
in
all
instances
estimates
of
dimensions
are
valueless
but
ratios
of
dimensions
are
more
acceptable
a
thing
said
to
have
been
six
feet
long
may
have
been
six
hundred
feet
long
but
shape
is
not
so
subject
to
the
illusions
of
distance
that
during
a
violent
storm
an
object
that
looked
to
be
about
inches
long
and
inches
wide
fell
rather
slowly
at
east
twickenham
england
it
exploded
no
substance
from
it
was
found
that
leverrier
had
sent
to
the
academy
three
letters
from
witnesses
of
a
long
luminous
body
tapering
at
both
ends
that
had
been
seen
in
the
sky
in
and
flammarion
says
that
on
during
a
rather
violent
storm
tr√©cul
of
the
french
academy
saw
a
very
brilliant
body
apparently
to
centimeters
long
and
about
centimeters
wide
or
a
cylindrical
body
with
slightly
conical
ends
it
dropped
something
and
disappeared
in
the
clouds
whatever
it
may
have
been
that
was
dropped
it
fell
vertically
like
a
heavy
object
and
left
a
luminous
train
the
scene
of
this
occurrence
may
have
been
far
from
the
observer
no
sound
was
heard
for
tr√©cul
account
see
weather
that
july
in
the
town
of
burlington
vermont
a
terrific
explosion
had
been
heard
throughout
the
city
a
ball
of
light
or
a
luminous
object
had
been
seen
to
fall
from
the
sky
or
from
a
thing
or
construction
in
the
sky
no
one
had
seen
this
thing
that
had
exploded
fall
from
a
larger
body
that
was
in
the
sky
but
if
we
accept
that
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
larger
body
in
the
sky
my
own
acceptance
is
that
a
dirigible
in
the
sky
or
a
construction
that
showed
every
sign
of
disrupting
had
barely
time
to
drop
whatever
it
did
drop
and
to
speed
away
to
safety
above
the
following
story
is
told
in
the
by
bishop
john
michaud
i
was
standing
on
the
corner
of
church
and
college
streets
just
in
front
of
the
howard
bank
and
facing
east
engaged
in
conversation
with
woodbury
and
buell
when
without
the
slightest
indication
or
warning
we
were
startled
by
what
sounded
like
a
most
unusual
and
terrific
explosion
evidently
very
nearby
raising
my
eyes
and
looking
eastward
along
college
street
i
observed
a
body
some
feet
away
stationary
in
appearance
and
suspended
in
the
air
about
feet
above
the
tops
of
the
buildings
in
size
it
was
about
feet
long
by
inches
in
diameter
the
shell
or
covering
having
a
dark
appearance
with
here
and
there
tongues
of
fire
issuing
from
spots
on
the
surface
resembling
unburnished
copper
although
stationary
when
first
noticed
this
object
soon
began
to
move
rather
slowly
and
disappeared
over
dolan
brothers
store
southward
as
it
moved
the
covering
seemed
rupturing
in
places
and
through
these
the
intensely
red
flames
issued
bishop
michaud
attempts
to
correlate
it
with
meteorological
observations
because
of
the
nearby
view
this
is
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
of
the
new
correlates
but
the
correlate
now
coming
is
extraordinary
because
of
the
great
number
of
recorded
observations
upon
it
my
own
acceptance
is
that
upon
a
vast
dirigible
crossed
england
but
by
the
of
all
things
some
observations
upon
it
can
be
correlated
with
anything
one
pleases
maunder
invited
by
the
editors
of
the
to
write
some
reminiscences
for
the
number
of
their
magazine
gives
one
that
he
says
stands
out
it
is
upon
something
that
he
terms
a
strange
celestial
visitor
maunder
was
at
the
royal
observatory
greenwich
at
night
there
was
an
aurora
without
features
of
special
interest
in
the
midst
of
the
aurora
a
great
circular
disk
of
greenish
light
appeared
and
moved
smoothly
across
the
sky
but
the
circularity
was
evidently
the
effect
of
foreshortening
the
thing
passed
above
the
moon
and
was
by
other
observers
described
as
like
a
torpedo
a
spindle
a
shuttle
the
idea
of
foreshortening
is
not
mine
maunder
says
this
he
says
had
the
incident
occurred
a
third
of
a
century
later
beyond
doubt
everyone
would
have
selected
the
same
simile
it
would
have
been
like
a
zeppelin
the
duration
was
about
two
minutes
color
said
to
have
been
the
same
as
that
of
the
auroral
glow
in
the
north
nevertheless
maunder
says
that
this
thing
had
no
relation
to
auroral
phenomena
it
appeared
to
be
a
definite
body
motion
too
fast
for
a
cloud
but
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
the
rush
of
a
meteor
in
the
rand
capron
in
a
lengthy
paper
alludes
throughout
to
this
phenomenon
as
an
auroral
beam
but
he
lists
many
observations
upon
its
and
one
observation
upon
a
dark
nucleus
in
it
host
of
most
confusing
observations
estimates
of
height
between
and
miles
observations
in
holland
and
belgium
we
are
told
that
according
to
capron
spectroscopic
observations
the
phenomenon
was
nothing
but
a
beam
of
auroral
light
in
the
is
maunder
contemporaneous
account
he
gives
apparent
approximate
length
and
breadth
at
degrees
and
three
degrees
and
a
half
he
gives
other
observations
seeming
to
indicate
structure
remarkable
dark
marking
down
the

that
because
of
the

but

not

is

only
assertion
of

slow
for
a
meteor
but
too
fast

from
a
cloud
about
a

diameter
moved
relatively
slowly
they
were
visible
more
than
an
hour

northward
it
is
said
that
eight
or
ten
years
before
similar
lights
or
objects
had
been
seen
in
the
sky
at
vence
london
that
at
inverness
scotland
two
large
bright
lights
that
looked
like
stars
had
been
seen
in

stationary
but
occasionally
moving
at

near

in
the
evening
a
large
spherical
light
and
two
smaller
ones

along
a

three
minutes
disappearing
without
noise

at
yloilo

luminous
object

by

the
false
lights
of
durham
every
now
and
then
in
the
english
newspapers
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
there
is
something
about
lights
that
were
seen
against
the
sky
but
as
if
not
far
above
land
oftenest
upon
the
coast
of
durham
they
were
mistaken
for
beacons
by
sailors
wreck
after
wreck
occurred
the
fishermen
were
accused
of
displaying
false
lights
and
profiting
by
wreckage
the
fishermen
answered
that
mostly
only
old
vessels
worthless
except
for
insurance
were
so
wrecked
in
london
popular
excitement
became
intense
there
was
an
investigation
before
a
commission
headed
by
admiral
collinson
testimony
was
taken
one
witness
described
the
light
that
had
deceived
him
as
considerably
elevated
above
ground
no
conclusion
was
reached
the
lights
were
called
the
mysterious
lights
but
whatever
the
false
lights
of
durham
may
have
been
they
were
unaffected
by
the
investigation
in
the
tyne
pilotage
board
took
the
matter
up

of
the
mayor
of
tyne
a
mysterious
affair
in
the
of
the
british
there
is
a
description
of
a
group
of
meteors
that
traveled
with
remarkable
slowness
they
were
in
sight
about
three
minutes
remarkable
it
seems
is
scarcely
strong
enough
one
reads
of
remarkable
as
applied
to
a
duration
of
three
seconds
these
meteors
had
another
peculiarity
they
left
no
train
they
are
described
as
seemingly
huddled
together
like
a
flock
of
wild
geese
and
moving
with
the
same
velocity
and
grace
of
regularity
roy
astro
soc
of
november
and
december
that
according
to
many
observations
collected
by
chant
of
toronto
there
appeared
upon
the
night
of
a
spectacle
that
was
seen
in
canada
the
united
states
and
at
sea
and
in
bermuda
a
luminous
body
was
seen
to
it
there
was
a
long
tail
the
body
grew
rapidly
larger
observers
differ
as
to
whether
the
body
was
single
or
was
composed
of
three
or
four
parts
with
a
tail
to
each
part
the
group
or
complex
structure
moved
with
a
peculiar
majestic
deliberation
it

in
the

another
group
emerged
from

onward
they
moved
at

deliberate
pace
in

they
disappeared

observers
compared
the
spectacle
to
a
fleet
of
airships
others
to
battleships
attended
by
cruisers
and
destroyers
according
to
one
writer
there
were
probably
or
bodies
and
the
peculiar
thing
about
them
was
their
moving
in
fours
and
threes
and
twos
abreast
of
one
another

so
perfect
was
the
lining

a
letter
from
capt
charles
norcock
of
that
upon
the
of
february
at
between
shanghai
and
japan
the
officer
of
the
watch
had
reported
some
unusual
lights
they
were
between
the
ship
and
a
mountain
the
mountain
was
about
feet
high
the
lights
seemed
to
be
globular
they
moved
sometimes
massed
but
sometimes
strung
out
in
an
irregular
line
they
bore
northward
until
lost
to
sight
duration
two
hours
the
next
night
the
lights
were
seen
again
they
were
for
a
time
eclipsed
by
a
small
island
they
bore
north
at
about
the
same
speed
and
in
about
the
same
direction
as
speed
and
direction
of
the
but
they
were
lights
that
cast
a
reflection
there
was
a
glare
upon
the
horizon
under
them
a
telescope
brought
out
but
few
details
that
they
were
reddish
and
seemed
to
emit
a
faint
smoke
this
time
the
duration
was
seven
and
a
half
hours
then
capt
norcock
says
that
in
the
same
general
locality
and
at
about
the
same
time
capt
castle
of
had
seen
lights
he
had
altered
his
course
and

made
toward

the

august
two
letters
from
crotsenburg
crow
agency
montana
that
in
the
summer
of
when
this
writer
was
a
railroad
postal
clerk
or
one
who
was
experienced
in
while
his
train
was
going
northward
from
trenton
he
and
another
clerk
saw
in
the
darkness
of
a
heavy
rain
a
light
that
appeared
to
be
round
and
of
a
color
and
seemed
to
be
about
a
foot
in
diameter
it
seemed
to
float
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
earth
but
soon
rose
high
or
midway
between
horizon
and
zenith
the
wind
was
quite
strong
from
the
east
but
the
light
held
a
course
almost
due
north
its
speed
varied
sometimes
it
seemed
to
outrun
the
train
considerably
at
other
times
it
seemed
to
fall
behind
the
watched
until
the
town
of
linville
iowa
was
reached
behind
the
depot
of
this
town
the
light
disappeared
and
was
not
seen
again
all
this
time
there
had
been
rain
but
very
little
lightning
but
crotsenburg
offers
the
explanation
that
it
was
ball
lightning
the
editor
of
the
disagrees
he
thinks
that
the
light
may
have
been
a
reflection
from
the
rain
or
fog
or
from
leaves
of
trees
glistening
with
rain
or
the
train
light
not
lights
in
the
december
number
of
the
is
a
letter
from
edward
boggs
that
the
light
was
a
reflection
perhaps
from
the
glare
one
light
this
time
from
the
locomotive
upon
wet
telegraph
wires
an
appearance
that
might
not
be
striated
by
the
wires
but
consolidated
into
one
rotundity
that
it
had
seemed
to
oscillate
with
the
undulations
of
the
wires
and
had
seemed
to
change
horizontal
distance
with
the
varying
angles
of
reflection
and
had
seemed
to
advance
or
fall
behind
when
the
train
had
rounded
curves
all
of
which
is
typical
of
the
best
of
it
includes
and
assimilates
diverse
data
but
it
excludes
that
which
will
destroy
it
that
acceptably
the
telegraph
wires
were
alongside
the
track
beyond
as
well
as
leading
to
linville
crotsenburg
thinks
of
ball
lightning
which
though
a
sore
bewilderment
to
most
speculation
is
usually
supposed
to
be
a
correlate
with
the
old
system
of
thought
but
his
awareness
of
something
else
is
expressed
in
other
parts
of
his
letters
when
he
says
that
he
has
something
to
tell
that
is
so
strange
that
i
should
never
have
mentioned
it
even
to
my
friends
had
it
not
been
corroborated
so
unreal
that
i
hesitated
to
speak
of
it
fearing
that
it
was
some
freak
of
the
imagination
vast
and
black
the
thing
that
was
poised
like
a
crow
over
the

and
smooth

of
sci
that
something
far
from

had

that
had

that
there
are
oceans
of

somewhere
in

that
dries
and
falls

for
ages
in

form
that
there
is
a
vast
area
that
will
some
day
be
known
to
aviators
as
the
desert
of

we
attempt
little
of
at
present
but
ocean
of
blood
or
desert
of
blood
or
both
italy
is
nearest
to
it
or
to
them
i
suspect
that
there
were
corpuscles
in
the
substance
that
fell
in
switzerland
but
all
that
could
be
published
in
was
that
in
this
substance
there
was
a
high
proportion
of
variously
shaped
organic
matter
at
giessen
germany
in
according
to
the
of
the
british
fell
a
rain
of
a
color
in
this
rain
were
flakes
of
a
hyacinthine
tint
it
is
said
that
this
substance
was
organic
we
are
told
that
it
was
pyrrhine
but
distinctly
enough
we
are
told
of
one
red
rain
that
it
was
of
corpuscular
composition
red
snow
rather
it
fell
march
near
the
crystal
palace
london
book
of
as
to
the
red
snow
of
polar
and
mountainous
regions
we
have
no
opposition
because
that
snow
has
never
been
seen
to
fall
from
the
sky
it
is
a
growth
of
or
of
a
protococcus
that
spreads
over
snow
that
is
on
the
ground
this
time
nothing
is
said
of
sand
from
the
sahara
it
is
said
of
the
red
matter
that
fell
in
london
march
that
it
was
composed
of
corpuscles
of
course
that
they
looked
like
vegetable
cells
a
note
that
nine
days
before
had
fallen
the
red
substance
flesh
whatever
it
may
have
been
of
bath
county
kentucky
i
think
that
a
vast
but
not
so
vast
as
it
had
supposed
had
refused
to
move
to
one
side
for
a
comet
we
summarize
our
general
expressions
gelatinous
regions
sulphurous
regions
frigid
and
tropical
regions
a
region
that
has
been
source
of
life
relatively
to
this
earth
regions
wherein
there
is
density
so
great
that
things
from
them
entering
this
earth
thin
atmosphere
explode
we
have
had
a
datum
of
explosive
hailstones
we
now
have
support
to
the
acceptance
that
they
had
been
formed
in
a
medium
far
denser
than
air
of
this
earth
at
in
the
science
is
an
account
of
ice
that
had
been
formed
under
great
pressure
in
the
laboratory
of
the
university
of
virginia
when
released
and
brought
into
contact
with
ordinary
air
this
ice
exploded
and
again
the
substance
that
fell
in
kentucky
its
formation
here
is
a
phenomenon
that
is
familiar
to
us
it
suggests
flattening
under
pressure
but
the
extraordinary
inference
is
pressure
not
equal
on
all
sides
in
the
record
of
it
is
said
that
in
after
a
heavy
thunderstorm
in
louisiana
a
tremendous
number
of
fish
scales
were
found
for
a
distance
of
forty
miles
along
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
river
bushels
of
them
picked
up
in
single
places
large
scales
that
were
said
to
be
of
the
gar
fish
a
fish
that
weighs
from
five
to
fifty
pounds
it
seems
impossible
to
accept
this
identification
one
thinks
of
a
substance
that
had
been
pressed
into
flakes
or
scales
and
round
hailstones
with
wide
thin
margins
of
ice
irregularly
around
them
still
such
hailstones
seem
to
me
more
like
things
that
had
been
stationary
had
been
held
in
a
field
of
thin
ice
in
the
london
are
drawings
of
hailstones
so
margined
as
if
they
had
been
held
in
a
sheet
of
ice
some
day
we
shall
have
an
expression
which
will
be
to
our
advanced
primitiveness
a
great
joy
that
devils
have
visited
this
earth
foreign
devils
beings
with
pointed
beards
good
singers
one
shoe
but
with
sulphurous
exhalations
at
any
rate
i
have
been
impressed
with
the
frequent
occurrence
of
sulphurousness
with
things
that
come
from
the
sky
a
fall
of
jagged
pieces
of
ice
orkney
july
roy
soc
they
had
a
strong
sulphurous
odor
and
the
coke
or
the
substance
that
looked
like
coke
that
fell
at
mortr√©e
france
april
with
it
fell
a
sulphurous
substance
the
enormous
round
things
that
rose
from
the
ocean
near
the
whether
we
still
accept
that
they
were
that
had
come
from
a
denser
atmosphere
and
in
danger
of
disruption
had
plunged
into
the
ocean
for
relief
then
rising
and
continuing
on
their
way
to
jupiter
or
uranus
it
was
reported
that
they
spread
a
stench
of
sulphur
at
any
rate
this
datum
of
proximity
is
against
the
conventional
explanation
that
these
things
did
not
rise
from
the
ocean
but
rose
far
away
above
the
horizon
with
illusion
of
nearness
and
the
things
that
were
seen
in
the
sky
july
i
have
another
note
in
a
correspondent
writes
that
upon
july
at
sedberg
he
had
seen
in
the
sky
a
red
object
or
in
his
own
wording
something
that
looked
like
the
red
part
of
a
rainbow
about
degrees
long
but
the
sky
was
dark
at
the
time
the
sun
had
set
a
heavy
rain
was
falling
throughout
this
book
the
datum
that
we
are
most
impressed
with
successive
falls
or
that
if
upon
one
small
area
things
fall
from
the
sky
and
then
later
fall
again
upon
the
same
small
area
they
are
not
products
of
a
whirlwind
which
though
sometimes
axially
stationary
discharges
tangentially
so
the
frogs
that
fell
at
wigan
i
have
looked
that
matter
up
again
later
more
frogs
fell
as
to
our
data
of
gelatinous
substance
said
to
have
fallen
to
this
earth
with
meteorites
it
is
our
expression
that
meteorites
tearing
through
the
shaky
protoplasmic
seas
of
genesistrine
against
which
we
warn
aviators
or
they
may
find
themselves
suffocating
in
a
reservoir
of
life
or
stuck
like
currants
in
a
blanc
mange
that
meteorites
detach
gelatinous
or
protoplasmic
lumps
that
fall
with
them
now
the
element
of
positiveness
in
our
composition
yearns
for
the
appearance
of
completeness
lakes
with
fishes
in
them
meteorites
that
plunge
through
these
lakes
on
their
way
to
this
earth
the
positiveness
in
our
must
have
expression
in
at
least
one
record
of
a
meteorite
that
has
brought
down
a
lot
of
fishes
with
it
that
near
the
bank
of
a
river
in
peru
a
meteorite
fell
on
the
spot
it
is
reported
several
dead
fishes
were
found
of
different
species
the
attempt
to
correlate
is
that
the
fishes
are
supposed
to
have
been
lifted
out
of
the
river
and
dashed
against
the
stones
whether
this
be
imaginable
or
not
depends
upon
each
one
own
hypnoses
that
the
fishes
had
fallen
among
the
fragments
of
the
meteorite
science
that
one
day
mr
le
gould
an
australian
scientist
was
traveling
in
queensland
he
saw
a
tree
that
had
been
broken
off
close
to
the
ground
where
the
tree
had
been
broken
was
a
great
bruise
near
by
was
an
object
that
resembled
a
shot
a
good
many
pages
back
there
was
an
instance
of
i
think
the
little
carved
stone
that
fell
at
tarbes
is
my
own
choice
as
the
most
impressive
of
our
new
correlates
it
was
coated
with
ice
remember
suppose
we
should
sift
and
sift
and
discard
half
the
data
in
this
book
suppose
only
that
one
datum
should
survive
to
call
attention
to
the
stone
of
tarbes
would
in
my
opinion
be
doing
well
enough
for
whatever
the
spirit
of
this
book
is
trying
to
do
nevertheless
it
seems
to
me
that
a
datum
that
preceded
it
was
slightingly
treated
the
disk
of
quartz
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
after
a
meteoric
explosion
said
to
have
fallen
at
the
plantation
bleijendal
dutch
guiana
sent
to
the
museum
of
leyden
by
van
sypesteyn
adjutant
to
the
governor
of
dutch
guiana
and
and
the
fragments
that
fall
from
ice
fields
flat
pieces
of
ice
with
icicles
on
them
i
think
that
we
did
not
emphasize
enough
that
if
these
structures
were
not
icicles
but
crystalline
protuberances
such
crystalline
formations
indicate
long
suspension
quite
as
notably
as
would
icicles
in
the
science
it
is
said
that
in
near
tiflis
fell
large
hailstones
with
long
protuberances
the
most
remarkable
point
in
connection
with
the
hailstones
is
the
fact
that
judging
from
our
present
knowledge
a
very
long
time
must
have
been
occupied
in
their
formation
according
to
the
this
fall
occurred
may
the
writer
in
the
says
that
of
all
theories
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
not
one
could
give
him
light
as
to
this
occurrence
these
growing
crystalline
forms
must
have
been
suspended
a
long
time
again
and
again
this
phenomenon
fourteen
days
later
at
about
the
same
place
more
of
these
hailstones
fell
rivers
of
blood
that
vein
albuminous
seas
or
an
composition
in
the
incubation
of
which
this
earth
is
a
local
center
of
development
that
there
are
of
blood
in
genesistrine
that
sunsets
are
consciousness
of
them
that
they
flush
the
skies
with
northern
lights
sometimes
reservoirs
from
which
emanate
or
that
our
whole
solar
system
is
a
living
thing
that
showers
of
blood
upon
this
earth
are
its
internal
hemorrhages
or
vast
living
things
in
the
sky
as
there
are
vast
living
things
in
the
oceans
or
some
one
especial
thing
an
especial
time
an
especial
place
a
thing
the
size
of
the
brooklyn
bridge
it
alive
in
outer
space
something
the
size
of
central
park
kills
it
it
drips
we
think
of
the
ice
fields
above
this
earth
which
do
not
themselves
fall
to
this
earth
but
from
which
water
does
fall
science
that
according
to
luigi
palazzo
head
of
the
italian
meteorological
bureau
upon
may
at
messignadi
calabria
something
the
color
of
fresh
blood
fell
from
the
sky
this
substance
was
examined
in
the
laboratories
of
rome
it
was
found
to
be
blood
the
most
probable
explanation
of
this
terrifying
phenomenon
is
that
migratory
birds
quails
or
swallows
were
caught
and
torn
in
a
violent
wind
so
the
substance
was
identified
as
birds
blood
what
matters
it
what
the
microscopists
of
rome
said
or
had
to
say
and
what
matters
it
that
we
point
out
that
there
is
no
assertion
that
there
was
a
violent
wind
at
the
time
and
that
such
a
substance
would
be
almost
infinitely
dispersed
in
a
violent
wind
that
no
bird
was
said
to
have
fallen
from
the
sky
or
said
to
have
been
seen
in
the
sky
that
not
a
feather
of
a
bird
is
said
to
have
been
seen
this
one
datum
the
fall
of
blood
from
the
sky
but
later
in
the
same
place
blood
again
fell
from
the
sky
and
a
correspondent
who
had
been
to
devonshire
writes
for
information
as
to
a
story
that
he
had
heard
there
of
an
occurrence
of
about
years
before
the
date
of
writing
of
snow
upon
the
ground
of
all
south
devonshire
waking
up
one
morning
to
find
such
tracks
in
the
snow
as
had
never
before
been
heard
of
clawed
footmarks
of
an
unclassifiable
form
alternating
at
huge
but
regular
intervals
with
what
seemed
to
be
the
impression
of
the
point
of
a
stick
but
the
scattering
of
the
prints
amazing
expanse
of
territory
covered
obstacles
such
as
hedges
walls
houses
seemingly
surmounted
intense
excitement
that
the
track
had
been
followed
by
huntsmen
and
hounds
until
they
had
come
to
a
forest
from
which
the
hounds
had
retreated
baying
and
terrified
so
that
no
one
had
dared
to
enter
the
forest
and
whole
occurrence
by
a
correspondent
a
badger
had
left
marks
in
the
snow
this
was
determined
and
the
excitement
had
dropped
to
a
dead
calm
in
a
single
day
and
that
for
years
a
correspondent
had
had
a
tracing
of
the
prints
which
his
mother
had
taken
from
those
in
the
snow
in
her
garden
in
exmouth
that
they
were
marks
but
had
been
made
by
a
biped
and
well
remembered
by
another
correspondent
who
writes
of
the
excitement
and
consternation
of
some
classes
he
says
that
a
kangaroo
had
escaped
from
a
menagerie
the
footprints
being
so
peculiar
and
far
apart
gave
rise
to
a
scare
that
the
devil
was
loose
we
have
had
a
story
and
now
we
shall
tell
it
over
from
contemporaneous
sources
we
have
had
the
later
accounts
first
very
largely
for
an
impression
of
the
correlating
effect
that
time
brings
about
by
addition
disregard
and
distortion
for
instance
the
dead
calm
in
a
single
day
if
i
had
found
that
the
excitement
did
die
out
rather
soon
i
incline
to
accept
that
nothing
extraordinary
had
occurred
i
found
that
the
excitement
had
continued
for
weeks
i
recognize
this
as
a
thing
to
say
to
divert
attention
from
a
discorrelate
all
phenomena
are
explained
in
the
terms
of
the
dominant
of
their
era
this
is
why
we
give
up
trying
really
to
explain
and
content
ourselves
with
expressing
devils
that
might
print
marks
in
snow
are
correlates
to
the
third
dominant
back
from
this
era
so
it
was
an
adjustment
by
correlates
or
human
tropisms
to
say
that
the
marks
in
the
snow
were
clawed
marks
are
not
only
horsey
but
devilish
it
had
to
be
said
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
those
prints
showed
we
shall
see
that
this
was
stated
by
owen
one
of
the
greatest
biologists
of
his
day
except
that
darwin
did
think
so
but
i
shall
give
reference
to
two
representations
of
them
that
can
be
seen
in
the
new
york
public
library
in
neither
representation
is
there
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
there
never
has
been
a
owen
who
has
explained
he
has
correlated
another
adaptation
in
the
later
accounts
is
that
of
leading
this
discorrelate
to
the
old
dominant
into
the
familiar
scenery
of
a
fairy
story
and
discredit
it
by
assimilation
to
the
conventionally
fictitious
so
the
idea
of
the
baying
terrified
hounds
and
forest
like
enchanted
forests
which
no
one
dared
to
enter
hunting
parties
were
organized
but
the
baying
terrified
hounds
do
not
appear
in
contemporaneous
accounts
the
story
of
the
kangaroo
looks
like
adaptation
to
needs
for
an
animal
that
could
spring
far
because
marks
were
found
in
the
snow
on
roofs
of
houses
but
so
astonishing
is
the
extent
of
snow
that
was
marked
that
after
a
while
another
kangaroo
was
added
but
the
marks
were
in
single
lines
my
own
acceptance
is
that
not
less
than
a
thousand
kangaroos
each
shod
with
a
very
small
horseshoe
could
have
marked
that
snow
of
devonshire
london
feb
considerable
sensation
has
been
caused
in
the
towns
of
topsham
lymphstone
exmouth
teignmouth
and
dawlish
in
devonshire
in
consequence
of
the
discovery
of
a
vast
number
of
foot
tracks
of
a
most
strange
and
mysterious
description
the
story
is
of
an
incredible
multiplicity
of
marks
discovered
in
the
morning
of
in
the
snow
by
the
inhabitants
of
many
towns
and
regions
between
towns
this
great
area
must
of
course
be
disregarded
by
owen
and
the
other
correlators
the
tracks
were
in
all
kinds
of
unaccountable
places
in
gardens
enclosed
by
high
walls
and
up
on
the
tops
of
houses
as
well
as
in
the
open
fields
there
was
in
lymphstone
scarcely
one
unmarked
garden
we
had
heroic
disregards
but
i
think
that
here
disregard
was
titanic
and
because
they
occurred
in
single
lines
the
marks
are
said
to
have
been
more
like
those
of
a
biped
than
of
a
quadruped
as
if
a
biped
would
place
one
foot
precisely
ahead
of
another
unless
it
hopped
but
then
we
have
to
think
of
a
thousand
or
of
thousands
it
is
said
that
the
marks
were
generally
inches
in
advance
of
each
other
the
impression
of
the
foot
closely
resembles
that
of
a
donkey
shoe
and
measured
from
an
inch
and
a
half
in
some
instances
to
two
and
a
half
inches
across
or
the
impressions
were
cones
in
incomplete
or
crescentic
basins
the
diameters
equaled
diameters
of
very
young
colts
hoofs
too
small
to
be
compared
with
marks
of
donkey
hoofs
on
sunday
last
the
rev
musgrave
alluded
to
the
subject
in
his
sermon
and
suggested
the
possibility
of
the
footprints
being
those
of
a
kangaroo
but
this
could
scarcely
have
been
the
case
as
they
were
found
on
both
sides
of
the
este
at
present
it
remains
a
mystery
and
many
superstitious
people
in
the
towns
are
actually
afraid
to
go
outside
their
doors
after
night
the
este
is
a
body
of
water
two
miles
wide
london
march
the
interest
in
this
matter
has
scarcely
yet
subsided
many
inquiries
still
being
made
into
the
origin
of
the
footprints
which
caused
so
much
consternation
upon
the
morning
of
the
ult
in
addition
to
the
circumstances
mentioned
in
the
a
little
while
ago
it
may
be
stated
that
at
dawlish
a
number
of
persons
sallied
out
armed
with
guns
and
other
weapons
for
the
purpose
if
possible
of
discovering
and
destroying
the
animal
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
so
busy
in
multiplying
its
footprints
as
might
have
been
expected
the
party
returned
as
they
went
various
speculations
have
been
made
as
to
the
cause
of
the
footprints
some
have
asserted
that
they
are
those
of
a
kangaroo
while
others
affirm
that
they
are
the
impressions
of
claws
of
large
birds
driven
ashore
by
stress
of
weather
on
more
than
one
occasion
reports
have
been
circulated
that
an
animal
from
a
menagerie
had
been
caught
but
the
matter
at
present
is
as
much
involved
in
mystery
as
ever
it
was
in
the
london
the
occurrence
is
given
a
great
deal
of
space
in
the
issue
of
a
sketch
is
given
of
the
prints
i
call
them
cones
in
incomplete
basins
except
that
they
a
little
longish
they
look
like
prints
of
hoofs
of
horses
or
rather
of
colts
but
they
in
a
single
line
it
is
said
that
the
marks
from
which
the
sketch
was
made
were
inches
apart
and
that
this
spacing
was
regular
and
invariable
in
every
parish
also
other
towns
besides
those
named
in
the
are
mentioned
the
writer
who
had
spent
a
winter
in
canada
and
was
familiar
with
tracks
in
snow
says
that
he
had
never
seen
a
more
clearly
defined
track
also
he
brings
out
the
point
that
was
so
persistently
disregarded
by
owen
and
the
other
correlators
that
no
known
animal
walks
in
a
line
of
single
footsteps
not
even
man
with
these
wider
inclusions
this
writer
concludes
with
us
that
the
marks
were
not
footprints
it
may
be
that
his
following
observation
hits
upon
the
crux
of
the
whole
occurrence
that
whatever
it
may
have
been
that
had
made
the
marks
it
had
removed
rather
than
pressed
the
snow
according
to
his
observations
the
snow
looked
as
if
branded
with
a
hot
iron
london
march
owen
to
whom
a
friend
had
sent
drawings
of
the
prints
writes
that
there
were
he
says
that
the
track
was
made
by
a
badger
six
other
witnesses
sent
letters
to
this
number
of
the
one
mentioned
but
not
published
is
a
notion
of
a
strayed
swan
always
this
a
badger
a
swan
a
track
i
should
have
listed
the
other
towns
as
well
as
those
mentioned
in
the
a
letter
from
musgrave
is
published
he
too
sends
a
sketch
of
the
prints
it
too
shows
a
single
line
there
are
four
prints
of
which
the
third
is
a
little
out
of
line
there
is
no
sign
of
a
the
prints
look
like
prints
of
longish
hoofs
of
a
very
young
colt
but
they
are
not
so
definitely
outlined
as
in
the
sketch
of
february
as
if
drawn
after
disturbance
by
wind
or
after
thawing
had
set
in
measurements
at
places
a
mile
and
a
half
apart
gave
the
same
exactly
eight
inches
and
a
half
apart
we
now
have
a
little
study
in
the
psychology
and
genesis
of
an
attempted
correlation
musgrave
says
i
found
a
very
apt
opportunity
to
mention
the
name
in
allusion
to
the
report
then
current
he
says
that
he
had
no
faith
in
the
himself
but
was
glad
that
a
kangaroo
was
in
the
wind
because
it
opposed
a
dangerous
degrading
and
false
impression
that
it
was
the
devil
mine
was
a
word
in
season
and
did
good
whether
it
jesuitical
or
not
and
no
matter
what
it
is
or
is
that
is
our
own
acceptance
that
though
we
often
been
carried
away
from
this
attitude
controversially
that
is
our
acceptance
as
to
every
correlate
of
the
past
that
has
been
considered
in
this
book
relatively
to
the
dominant
of
its
era
another
correspondent
writes
that
though
the
prints
in
all
cases
resembled
hoof
marks
there
were
indistinct
traces
of
claws
that
an
otter
had
made
the
marks
after
that
many
other
witnesses
wrote
to
the
the
correspondence
was
so
great
that
in
the
issue
of
march
only
a
selection
could
be
given
there
a
solution
and
a
inspiration
and
then
someone
came
out
strong
with
an
idea
of
a
hare
that
had
galloped
with
pairs
of
feet
held
close
together
so
as
to
make
impressions
in
a
single
line
london
march
among
the
high
mountains
of
that
elevated
district
where
glenorchy
glenlyon
and
glenochay
are
contiguous
there
have
been
met
with
several
times
during
this
and
also
the
former
winter
upon
the
snow
the
tracks
of
an
animal
seemingly
unknown
at
present
in
scotland
the
print
in
every
respect
is
an
exact
resemblance
to
that
of
a
foal
of
considerable
size
with
this
small
difference
perhaps
that
the
sole
seems
a
little
longer
or
not
so
round
but
as
no
one
has
had
the
good
fortune
as
yet
to
have
obtained
a
glimpse
of
this
creature
nothing
more
can
be
said
of
its
shape
or
dimensions
only
it
has
been
remarked
from
the
depth
to
which
the
feet
sank
in
the
snow
that
it
must
be
a
beast
of
considerable
size
it
has
been
observed
also
that
its
walk
is
not
like
that
of
the
generality
of
quadrupeds
but
that
it
is
more
like
the
bounding
or
leaping
of
a
horse
when
scared
or
pursued
it
is
not
in
one
locality
that
its
tracks
have
been
met
with
but
through
a
range
of
at
least
twelve
miles
in
the
london
march
a
correspondent
from
heidelberg
writes
upon
the
authority
of
a
polish
doctor
of
medicine
that
on
the
sand
hill
a
small
elevation
on
the
border
of
galicia
but
in
russian
poland
such
marks
are
to
be
seen
in
the
snow
every
year
and
sometimes
in
the
sand
of
this
hill
and
are
attributed
by
the
inhabitants
to
supernatural
influences
