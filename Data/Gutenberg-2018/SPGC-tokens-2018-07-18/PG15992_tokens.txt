preface
very
nearly
the
whole
of
this
book
is
sober
historical
fact
and
by
far
the
greater
number
of
the
personages
named
in
it
once
lived
and
acted
in
the
manner
in
which
i
have
presented
them
my
hero
and
my

are
fictitious

one

two

a
farmer
and
his

the
landlord
of
an

a
few
other

characters
but
the
family
of
the
fitzherberts
passed
precisely
through
the
fortunes
which
i
have
described
they
had
their
confessors

their

often
to

all
these
things
took
place
as
nearly
as
i

had
the
power
of
relating

localities

padley
or
rather
the

circumstances
described
in
this
book
remains
to
this
day
close
to
grindleford
station
a
catholic
pilgrimage
is
made
there
every
year
and
i
have
myself
once
had
the
honour
of
preaching
on
such
an
occasion
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
old
hall
that
is
immediately
beneath
the
chapel
where
garlick
and
ludlam
said
their
last
masses
and
were
captured
if
the
book
is
too
sensational
it
is
no
more
sensational
than
life
itself
was
to
derbyshire
folk
between
and
it
remains
only
first
to
express
my
extreme
indebtedness
to
dom
bede
camm
erudite
book
forgotten
shrines
from
which
i
have
taken
immense
quantities
of
information
and
to
a
pile
of
some
twenty
to
thirty
other
books
that
are
before
me
as
i
write
these
words
and
secondly
to
ask
forgiveness
from
the
distinguished
family
that
takes
its
name
from
the
fitzherberts
and
is
descended
from
them
directly
and
to
assure
its
members
that
old
sir
thomas
john
anthony
and
all
the
rest
down
to
the
present
day
outweigh
a
thousand
times
over
to
the
minds
of
all
decent
people
the
stigma
of
thomas
name
even
the
apostles
numbered

i
i
there
should
be
no
sight
more
happy
than
a
young
man
riding
to
meet
his
love
his
eyes
should
shine
his
lips
should
sing
he
should
slap
his
mare
upon
her
shoulder
and
call
her
his
darling
the
puddles
upon
his
way
should
be
turned
to
pure
gold
and
the
stream
that
runs
beside
him
should
chatter
her
name
yet
as
robin
rode
to
marjorie
none
of
these
things
were
done
it
was
a
still
day
of
frost
the
sky
was
arched
above
him
across
the
high
hills
like
that
terrible
crystal
which
is
the
vault
above
which
sits
god
hard
blue
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
fringe
of
feathery
birches
stood
like
above
him
on
his
left
on
his
right
ran
the
derwent
sucking
softly
among
his
sedges
on
this
side
and
that
lay
the
flat
bottom
through
which
he
went
meadowland
broken
by
rushes
his
mare
cecily
stepped
along
now
cracking
the
thin
ice
of
the
little
pools
with
her
dainty
feet
now
going
gently
over
peaty
ground
blowing
thin
clouds
from
her
red
nostrils
yet
unencouraged
by
word
or
caress
from
her
rider
who
sat
heavy
and
all
but
slouching
staring
with
his
blue
eyes
under
puckered
eyelids
as
if
he
went
to
an
appointment
which
he
would
not
keep
yet
he
was
a
very
pleasant
lad
to
look
upon
and
gallant
mounted
and
dressed
in
a
manner
that
should
give
any
lad
joy
he
wore
great
gauntlets
on
his
hands
he
was
in
his
habit
of
green
he
had
his
leather
belt
upon
him
beneath
his
cloak
and
a
pair
of
daggers
in
it
with
his
looped
up
he
had
his
felt
hat
on
his
head
buckled
again
and
decked
with
half
a
pheasant
tail
he
had
his
long
boots
of
undressed
leather
that
rose
above
his
knees
and
on
his
left
wrist
sat
his
grim
falcon
agnes
hooded
and
belled
not
because
he
rode
after
game
but
from
mere
custom
and
to
give
her
the
air
he
was
meeting
his
first
man
trouble
last
year
he
had
said
to
derby
grammar
school
of
old
my
lord
bishop
durdant
foundation
situated
in
peter
churchyard
here
he
had
done
the
right
and
usual
things
he
had
learned
his
grammar
he
had
fought
he
had
been
chastised
he
had
robed
the
effigy
of
his
pious
founder
in
a
patched
doublet
with
a
saucepan
on
his
head
but
that
had
been
done
before
he
had
learned
veneration
and
so
had
gone
home
again
to
matstead
proficient
in
latin
english
history
writing
good
manners
and
chess
to
live
with
his
father
to
hunt
to
hear
mass
when
a
priest
was
within
reasonable
distance
to
indite
painful
letters
now
and
then
on
matters
of
the
estate
and
to
learn
how
to
bear
himself
generally
as
should
one
of
master
rank
the
son
of
a
gentleman
who
bore
arms
and
his
father
father
before
him
he
dined
at
twelve
he
supped
at
six
he
said
his
prayers
and
blessed
himself
when
no
strangers
were
by
he
was
something
of
a
herbalist
as
a
sheer
hobby
of
his
own
he
went
to
feed
his
falcons
in
the
morning
he
rode
with
them
after
dinner
from
last
august
he
had
found
himself
riding
north
more
often
than
south
since
marjorie
lived
in
that
quarter
and
now
all
had
been
crowned
last
christmas
eve
when
in
the
enclosed
garden
at
her
house
he
had
kissed
her
two
hands
suddenly
and
made
her
a
little
speech
he
had
learned
by
heart
after
which
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
as
a
man
should
in
the
honest
noon
sunlight
all
this
was
as
it
should
be
there
were
no
doubts
or
disasters
anywhere
marjorie
was
an
only
daughter
as
he
an
only
son
her
father
it
is
true
was
but
a
derby
lawyer
but
he
and
his
wife
had
a
good
little
estate
above
the
hathersage
valley
and
a
stone
house
in
it
as
for
religion
that
was
all
well
too
master
manners
was
as
good
a
catholic
as
master
audrey
himself
and
the
families
met
at
mass
perhaps
as
much
as
four
or
five
times
in
the
year
either
at
padley
where
sir
thomas
chapel
still
had
priests
coming
and
going
sometimes
at
dethick
in
the
babingtons
barn
sometimes
as
far
north
as
harewood
and
now
a
man
trouble
was
come
upon
the
boy
the
cause
of
it
was
as
follows
robin
audrey
was
no
more
religious
than
a
boy
of
seventeen
should
be
yet
he
had
had
as
few
doubts
about
the
matter
as
if
he
had
been
a
monk
his
mother
had
taught
him
well
up
to
the
time
of
her
death
ten
years
ago
and
he
had
learned
from
her
as
well
as
from
his
father
when
that
professor
spoke
of
it
at
all
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
religion
in
the
world
the
true
and
the
false
that
is
to
say
the
catholic
religion
and
the
other
one
certainly
there
were
shades
of
differences
in
the
other
one
the
turk
did
not
believe
precisely
as
the
ancient
roman
nor
yet
as
the
modern
protestant
yet
these
distinctions
were
subtle
and
negligible
they
were
all
swallowed
up
in
an
unity
of
falsehood
next
he
had
learned
that
the
catholic
religion
was
at
present
blown
upon
by
many
persons
in
high
position
that
pains
and
penalties
lay
upon
all
who
adhered
to
it
sir
thomas
fitzherbert
for
instance
lay
now
in
the
fleet
in
london
on
that
very
account
his
own
father
too
three
or
four
times
in
the
year
was
under
necessity
of
paying
over
heavy
sums
for
the
privilege
of
not
attending
protestant
worship
and
indeed
had
been
forced
last
year
to
sell
a
piece
of
land
over
on
lees
moor
for
this
very
purpose
priests
came
and
went
at
their
peril
he
himself
had
fought
two
or
three
battles
over
the
affair
in
peter
churchyard
until
he
had
learned
to
hold
his
tongue
but
all
this
was
just
part
of
the
game
it
seemed
to
him
as
inevitable
and
eternal
as
the
changes
of
the
weather
matstead
church
he
knew
had
once
been
catholic
but
how
long
ago
he
did
not
care
to
inquire
he
only
knew
that
for
awhile
there
had
been
some
doubt
on
the
matter
and
that
before
barton
time
who
was
now
minister
there
there
had
been
a
proper
priest
in
the
place
who
had
read
english
prayers
there
and
a
sort
of
a
mass
which
he
had
attended
as
a
little
boy
then
this
had
ceased
the
priest
had
gone
and
barton
come
and
since
that
time
he
had
never
been
to
church
there
but
had
heard
the
real
mass
wherever
he
could
with
a
certain
secrecy
and
there
might
be
further
perils
in
future
as
there
might
be
thunderstorms
or
floods
there
was
still
the
memory
of
the
descent
of
the
commissioners
a
year
or
two
after
his
birth
he
had
been
brought
up
on
the
stories
of
riding
and
and
the
hiding
away
of
and
beads
and
vestments
but
all
this
was
in
his
bones
and
blood
it
was
as
natural
that
professors
of
the
false
religion
should
seek
to
injure
and
distress
professors
of
the
true
as
that
the
foxes
should
attack
the
one
took
one
precautions
one
hoped
for
the
best
and
one
was
quite
sure
that
one
day
the
happy
ancient
times
his
mother
had
told
him
of
would
come
back
and
christ
cause
be
vindicated
and
now
the
foundations
of
the
earth
were
moved
and
heaven
reeled
above
him
for
his
father
after
a
month
or
two
of
brooding
had
announced
on
stephen
day
that
he
could
tolerate
it
no
longer
that
demands
were
unreasonable
that
after
all
the
protestant
religion
was
the
religion
of
her
grace
that
men
must
learn
to
move
with
the
times
and
that
he
had
paid
his
last
fine
at
easter
he
observed
he
would
take
the
bread
and
wine
in
matstead
church
and
robin
would
take
them
too
ii
the
sun
stood
towards
his
setting
as
robin
rode
up
from
the
valley
past
padley
over
the
steep
ascent
that
led
towards
edge
the
boy
was
brighter
a
little
as
he
came
up
he
had
counted
above
eighty
snipe
within
the
last
mile
and
a
half
and
he
was
coming
near
to
marjorie
about
him
rising
higher
as
he
rose
stood
the
great
hills
cecily
stepped
out
more
sharply
snuffing
delicately
for
she
knew
her
way
well
enough
by
now
and
looked
for
a
feed
and
the
boy
perplexities
stood
off
from
him
a
little
matters
must
surely
be
better
so
soon
as
marjorie
clear
eyes
looked
upon
them
then
the
roofs
of
padley
disappeared
behind
him
and
he
saw
the
smoke
going
up
from
the
little
timbered
hall
standing
back
against
its
bare
trees
a
great
clatter
and
din
of
barking
broke
out
as
the
mare
hoofs
sounded
on
the
space
before
the
great
door
and
then
in
the
pause
a
gaggling
of
geese
solemn
and
earnest
from
out
of
sight
jacob
led
the
outcry
a
great
mastiff
chained
by
the
entrance
of
the
breed
of
which
three
are
set
to
meet
a
bear
and
four
a
lion
then
two
harriers
whipped
round
the
corner
and
a
terrier
head
showed
itself
over
the
wall
of
the
on
the
left
as
a
man
bareheaded
in
his
shirt
and
breeches
ran
out
suddenly
with
a
thonged
whip
in
time
to
meet
a
pair
of
spaniels
in
full
career
robin
sat
his
horse
silently
till
peace
was
restored
his
right
leg
flung
across
the
pommel
untwisting
agnes
leash
from
his
fist
then
he
asked
for
mistress
marjorie
and
dropped
to
the
ground
leaving
his
mare
and
falcon
in
the
man
hands
with
an
air
he
flicked
his
fingers
to
growling
jacob
as
he
went
past
to
the
side
entrance
on
the
east
stepped
in
through
the
little
door
that
was
beside
the
great
one
and
passed
on
as
he
had
been
bidden
into
the
little
court
turned
to
the
left
went
up
an
outside
staircase
and
so
down
a
little
passage
to
the
ladies
parlour
where
he
knocked
upon
the
door
the
voice
he
knew
called
to
him
from
within
and
he
went
in
smiling
to
himself
then
he
took
the
girl
who
awaited
him
there
in
both
his
arms
and
kissed
her
twice
first
her
hands
and
then
her
lips
for
respect
should
come
first
and
ardour
second
my
love
said
robin
and
threw
off
his
hat
with
the
pheasant
tail
for
coolness
sake
it
was
a
sweet
room
this
which
he
already
knew
by
heart
for
it
was
here
that
he
had
sat
with
marjorie
and
her
mother
silent
and
confused
evening
after
evening
last
autumn
it
was
here
too
that
she
had
led
him
last
christmas
eve
scarcely
ten
days
ago
after
he
had
kissed
her
in
the
enclosed
garden
but
the
low
frosty
sunlight
lay
in
it
now
upon
the
blue
painted
wainscot
that
rose
half
up
the
walls
the
tall
presses
where
the
linen
lay
the
pieces
of
stuff
embroidered
with
pale
lutes
and
wreaths
that
mistress
manners
had
bought
in
derby
hanging
now
over
the
plaster
spaces
there
was
a
chimney
too
newly
built
that
was
thought
a
great
luxury
and
in
it
burned
an
armful
of
logs
for
the
girl
was
setting
out
new
linen
for
the
household
and
the
scents
of
lavender
and
burning
wood
disputed
the
air
between
them
i
thought
it
would
be
you
she
said
when
i
heard
the
dogs
she
piled
the
last
rolls
of
linen
in
an
ordered
heap
and
came
to
sit
beside
him
robin
took
one
hand
in
his
and
sat
silent
she
was
of
an
age
with
him
perhaps
a
month
the
younger
and
as
it
ought
to
be
was
his
very
contrary
in
all
respects
where
he
was
fair
she
was
pale
and
dark
his
eyes
were
blue
hers
black
he
was
lusty
and
showed
promise
of
broadness
she
was
slender
and
what
news
do
you
bring
with
you
now
she
said
presently
he
evaded
this
mistress
manners
he
asked
mother
has
a
megrim
she
said
she
is
in
her
chamber
and
she
smiled
at
him
again
for
these
two
as
is
the
custom
of
young
persons
who
love
one
another
had
said
not
a
word
on
either
side
neither
he
to
his
father
nor
she
to
her
parents
they
believed
as
young
persons
do
that
parents
who
bring
children
into
the
world
hold
it
as
a
chief
danger
that
these
children
should
follow
their
example
and
themselves
be
married
besides
there
is
something
delicious
in
secrecy
then
i
will
kiss
you
again
he
said
while
there
is
opportunity
making
love
is
a
very
good
way
to
pass
the
time
above
all
when
that
same
time
presses
and
other
disconcerting
things
should
be
spoken
of
instead
and
this
device
robin
now
learned
he
spoke
of
a
hundred
things
that
were
of
no
importance
of
the
dress
that
she
wore
russet
as
it
should
be
for
country
girls
with
the
loose
sleeves
folded
back
above
her
elbows
that
she
might
handle
the
linen
her
apron
of
coarse
linen
her
shoes
he
told
her
that
he
loved
her
better
in
that
than
in
her
costume
of
state
the
ruff
the
fardingale
the
brocaded
petticoat
and
all
the
rest
in
which
he
had
seen
her
once
last
summer
at
babington
house
he
talked
then
when
she
would
hear
no
more
of
that
of
tuesday
when
they
would
meet
for
hawking
in
the
lower
chase
of
the
padley
estates
and
proceeded
then
to
speak
of
agnes
whom
he
had
left
on
the
fist
of
the
man
who
had
taken
his
mare
of
her
increasing
infirmities
and
her
crimes
of
crabbing
and
all
the
while
he
held
her
left
hand
in
both
of
his
and
fitted
her
fingers
between
his
and
kissed
them
again
when
he
had
no
more
to
say
on
any
one
point
and
wondered
why
he
could
not
speak
of
the
matter
on
which
he
had
come
and
how
he
should
tell
her
and
then
at
last
she
drew
it
from
him
and
now
my
robin
she
said
tell
me
what
you
have
in
your
mind
you
have
talked
of
this
and
that
and
agnes
and
jock
and
padley
chase
and
you
have
not
once
looked
me
in
the
eyes
since
you
first
came
in
now
it
was
not
shame
that
had
held
him
from
telling
her
but
rather
a
kind
of
bewilderment
the
affair
might
hold
shame
indeed
or
anger
or
sorrow
or
complacence
but
he
did
not
know
and
he
wished
as
young
men
of
decent
birth
should
wish
to
present
the
proper
emotion
on
its
right
occasion
he
had
pondered
on
the
matter
continually
since
his
father
had
spoken
to
him
on
saint
stephen
night
and
at
one
time
it
seemed
that
his
father
was
acting
the
part
of
a
traitor
and
at
another
of
a
philosopher
if
it
were
indeed
true
after
all
that
all
men
were
turning
protestant
and
that
there
was
not
so
much
difference
between
the
two
religions
then
it
would
be
the
act
of
a
wise
man
to
turn
protestant
too
if
only
for
a
while
and
on
the
other
hand
his
pride
of
birth
and
his
education
by
his
mother
and
his
practice
ever
since
drew
him
hard
the
other
way
he
was
in
a
strait
between
the
two
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
he
feared
what
marjorie
might
think
it
was
this
then
that
had
held
him
silent
he
feared
what
marjorie
might
think
for
that
was
the
very
thing
that
he
thought
that
he
thought
too
and
he
foresaw
a
hundred
inconveniences
and
troubles
if
it
were
so
how
did
you
know
i
had
anything
in
my
mind
he
asked
is
it
not
enough
reason
for
my
coming
that
you
should
be
here
she
laughed
softly
with
a
pleasant
scornfulness
i
read
you
like
a
printed
book
she
said
what
else
are
women
wits
given
them
for
he
fell
to
stroking
her
hand
again
at
that
but
she
drew
it
away
not
until
you
have
told
me
she
said
so
then
he
told
her
it
was
a
long
tale
for
it
began
as
far
ago
as
last
august
when
his
father
had
come
back
from
giving
evidence
before
the
justices
at
derby
on
a
matter
of
witchcraft
and
had
been
questioned
again
about
his
religion
it
was
then
that
robin
had
seen
moodiness
succeed
to
anger
and
long
silence
to
moodiness
he
told
the
tale
with
a
true
lover
art
for
he
watched
her
face
and
trained
his
tone
and
his
manner
as
he
saw
her
thoughts
come
and
go
in
her
eyes
and
lips
like
gusts
of
wind
across
standing
corn
and
at
last
he
told
her
outright
what
his
father
had
said
to
him
on
stephen
night
and
how
he
himself
had
kept
silence
marjorie
face
was
as
white
as
a
moth
wing
when
he
was
finishing
and
her
eyes
like
sunset
pools
but
she
flamed
up
bright
and
rosy
as
he
finished
you
kept
silence
she
cried
i
did
not
wish
to
anger
him
my
dear
he
is
my
father
he
said
gently
the
colour
died
out
of
her
face
again
and
she
nodded
once
or
twice
and
a
great
pensiveness
came
down
on
her
he
took
her
hand
again
softly
and
she
did
not
resist
the
only
doubt
she
said
presently
as
if
she
talked
to
herself
is
whether
you
had
best
be
gone
at
easter
or
stay
and
face
it
out
yes
said
robin
with
his
dismay
come
fully
to
the
birth
then
she
turned
on
him
full
of
a
sudden
tenderness
and
compassion
oh
my
robin
she
cried
and
i
have
not
said
a
word
about
you
and
your
own
misery
i
was
thinking
but
of
christ
honour
you
must
forgive
me
what
must
it
be
for
you
that
it
should
be
your
father
you
are
sure
that
he
means
it
my
father
does
not
speak
until
he
means
it
he
is
always
like
that
he
asks
counsel
from
no
one
he
thinks
and
he
thinks
and
then
he
speaks
and
it
is
finished
she
fell
then
to
thinking
again
her
sweet
lips
compressed
together
and
her
eyes
frightened
and
wondering
searching
round
the
hanging
above
the
it
presented
icarus
in
the
chariot
of
the
sun
and
it
was
said
in
derby
that
it
had
come
from
my
lord
abbot
lodging
at
bolton
meantime
robin
thought
too
he
was
as
wax
in
the
hands
of
this
girl
and
knew
it
and
loved
that
it
should
be
so
yet
he
could
not
help
his
dismay
while
he
waited
for
her
seal
to
come
down
on
him
and
stamp
him
to
her
model
for
he
foresaw
more
clearly
than
ever
now
the
hundred
inconveniences
that
must
follow
now
that
it
was
evident
that
to
marjorie
mind
and
therefore
to
god
almighty
there
must
be
no
tampering
with
the
old
religion
he
had
known
that
it
must
be
so
yet
he
had
thought
on
the
way
here
of
a
dozen
families
he
knew
who
in
his
own
memory
had
changed
from
allegiance
to
the
pope
of
rome
to
that
of
her
grace
without
seeming
one
penny
the
worse
there
were
the
martins
down
there
in
derby
the
squire
and
his
lady
of
ashenden
hall
the
conways
of
matlock
and
the
rest
these
had
all
changed
and
though
he
did
not
respect
them
for
it
yet
the
truth
was
that
they
were
not
yet
stricken
by
thunderbolts
or
eaten
by
the
plague
he
had
wondered
whether
there
were
not
a
way
to
do
as
they
had
done
yet
without
the
disgrace
of
it
however
this
was
plainly
not
to
be
so
with
him
he
must
put
up
with
the
inconveniences
as
well
as
he
could
and
he
just
waited
to
hear
from
marjorie
how
this
must
be
done
she
turned
to
him
again
at
last
twice
her
lips
opened
to
speak
and
twice
she
closed
them
again
robin
continued
to
stroke
her
hand
and
wait
for
judgment
the
third
time
she
spoke
i
think
you
must
go
away
she
said
for
easter
tell
your
father
that
you
can
not
change
your
religion
simply
because
he
tells
you
so
i
do
not
see
what
else
is
to
be
done
he
will
think
perhaps
that
if
you
have
a
little
time
to
think
you
will
come
over
to
him
well
that
is
not
so
but
it
may
make
it
easier
for
him
to
believe
it
for
a
while
you
must
go
somewhere
where
there
is
a
priest
where
can
you
go
robin
considered
i
could
go
to
dethick
he
said
that
is
not
far
enough
away
i
think
i
could
come
here
he
suggested
artfully
a
smile
lit
in
her
eyes
shone
in
her
mouth
and
passed
again
into
seriousness
that
is
scarcely
a
mile
further
she
said
we
must
think
will
he
be
very
angry
robin
robin
smiled
grimly
i
have
never
withstood
him
in
a
great
affair
he
said
he
is
angry
enough
over
little
things
poor
robin
oh
he
is
not
unjust
to
me
he
is
a
good
father
to
me
that
makes
it
all
the
sadder
she
said
and
there
is
no
other
way
he
asked
presently
she
glanced
at
him
unless
you
would
withstand
him
to
the
face
would
you
do
that
robin
i
will
do
anything
you
tell
me
he
said
simply
you
darling
well
robin
listen
to
me
it
is
very
plain
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
have
to
withstand
him
you
can
not
go
away
every
time
there
is
communion
at
matstead
or
indeed
every
sunday
your
father
would
have
to
pay
the
fines
for
you
i
have
no
doubt
unless
you
went
away
altogether
but
i
think
you
had
better
go
away
for
this
time
he
will
almost
expect
it
i
think
at
first
he
will
think
that
you
will
yield
to
him
and
then
little
by
little
unless
god
grace
brings
himself
back
to
the
faith
he
will
learn
to
understand
that
you
will
not
but
it
will
be
easier
for
him
that
way
and
he
will
have
time
to
think
what
to
do
with
you
too
robin
what
would
you
do
if
you
went
away
robin
considered
again
i
can
read
and
write
he
said
i
am
a
latinist
i
can
train
falcons
and
hounds
and
break
horses
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
anything
else
that
i
can
do
you
darling
she
said
again
these
two
as
will
have
been
seen
were
as
simple
as
children
and
as
serious
children
are
not
gay
and
except
now
and
then
just
as
men
and
women
are
not
serious
except
now
and
then
they
are
grave
and
considering
all
that
they
lack
is
experience
these
two
then
were
real
children
they
were
grave
and
serious
because
a
great
thing
had
disclosed
itself
to
them
in
which
two
or
three
large
principles
were
present
and
no
more
there
was
that
love
of
one
another
whose
consummation
seemed
imperilled
for
how
could
these
two
ever
wed
if
robin
were
to
quarrel
with
his
father
there
was
the
religion
which
was
in
their
bones
and
blood
the
religion
for
which
already
they
had
suffered
and
their
fathers
before
them
there
was
the
honour
and
loyalty
which
this
new
and
more
personal
suffering
demanded
now
louder
than
ever
and
in
marjorie
at
least
as
will
be
seen
more
plainly
later
there
was
a
strong
love
of
jesus
christ
and
his
mother
whom
she
knew
from
her
hidden
crucifix
and
her
beads
and
her
jesus
psalter
which
she
used
every
day
as
well
as
in
her
own
soul
to
be
wandering
together
once
more
among
the
hills
of
derbyshire
sheltering
at
peril
of
their
lives
in
stables
and
barns
and
little
secret
chambers
because
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
their
own
places
it
was
this
last
consideration
as
robin
had
begun
to
guess
that
stood
strongest
in
the
girl
it
was
this
too
as
again
he
had
begun
to
guess
that
made
her
all
that
she
was
to
him
that
gave
her
that
strange
serious
air
of
innocency
and
sweetness
and
drew
from
him
a
love
that
was
reverence
and
adoration
he
always
kissed
her
hands
first
it
will
be
remembered
before
her
lips
so
then
they
sat
and
considered
and
talked
they
did
not
speak
much
of
her
grace
nor
of
her
grace
religion
nor
of
her
counsellors
and
affairs
of
state
these
things
were
but
toys
and
vanities
compared
with
matters
of
love
and
faith
neither
did
they
speak
much
of
the
commissioners
that
had
been
to
derbyshire
once
and
would
come
again
or
of
the
alarms
and
the
dangers
and
the
priest
hunters
since
those
things
did
not
at
present
touch
them
very
closely
it
was
rather
of
father
and
whether
and
when
the
maid
should
tell
her
parents
and
how
this
new
trouble
would
conflict
with
their
love
they
spoke
that
is
to
say
of
their
own
business
and
of
god
and
of
nothing
else
the
frosty
sunshine
crept
down
the
painted
wainscot
and
lay
at
last
at
their
feet
reddening
to
rosiness
iii
robin
rode
away
at
last
with
a
very
clear
idea
of
what
he
was
to
do
in
the
immediate
present
and
with
no
idea
at
all
of
what
was
to
be
done
later
marjorie
had
given
him
three
things
advice
a
pair
of
beads
that
had
been
the
property
of
cuthbert
maine
seminary
priest
recently
executed
in
cornwall
for
his
religion
and
a
kiss
the
first
deliberate
kiss
she
had
ever
given
him
the
first
he
was
to
keep
the
second
he
was
to
return
the
third
he
was
to
remember
and
these
three
things
or
rather
his
consideration
of
them
worked
upon
him
as
he
went
her
advice
besides
that
which
has
been
described
was
principally
to
say
his
jesus
psalter
more
punctually
to
hear
mass
whenever
that
were
possible
to
trust
in
god
and
to
be
patient
and
submissive
with
his
father
in
all
things
that
did
not
touch
divine
love
and
faith
the
pair
of
beads
that
were
once
maine
he
was
to
keep
upon
him
always
day
and
night
and
to
use
them
for
his
devotions
the
kiss
well
he
was
to
remember
this
and
to
return
it
to
her
upon
their
next
meeting
a
great
star
came
out
as
he
drew
near
home
his
path
took
him
not
through
the
village
but
behind
it
near
enough
for
him
to
hear
the
barkings
of
the
dogs
and
to
smell
upon
the
frosty
air
the
scent
of
the
wood
fires
the
house
was
a
great
one
for
these
parts
there
was
a
small
before
it
built
by
his
father
for
dignity
with
a
lodge
on
either
side
and
an
arch
in
the
middle
and
beyond
this
lay
the
short
road
straight
and
broad
that
went
up
to
the
court
of
the
house
this
court
was
on
three
sides
of
it
buildings
the
hall
and
the
buttery
and
the
in
the
midst
with
the
stables
and
falconry
on
the
left
and
the
servants
lodgings
on
the
right
the
fourth
side
that
which
lay
opposite
to
the
little
was
a
wall
with
a
great
double
gate
in
it
hung
on
stone
posts
that
had
each
of
them
a
great
stone
dog
that
held
a
blank
shield
all
this
later
part
the
wall
with
the
gate
the
stables
and
the
servants
lodgings
as
well
as
the
gatehouse
without
had
been
built
by
the
lad
father
twenty
years
ago
to
bring
home
his
wife
to
for
until
that
time
the
house
had
been
but
a
little
place
though
built
of
stone
and
solid
and
good
enough
the
house
stood
up
the
rise
of
the
hill
above
the
village
with
woods
about
it
and
behind
it
and
it
was
above
these
woods
behind
that
the
great
star
came
out
like
a
diamond
in
and
robin
looked
at
it
and
fell
to
thinking
of
marjorie
again
putting
all
other
thoughts
away
then
as
he
rode
through
into
the
court
on
to
the
cobbled
stones
a
man
ran
out
from
the
stable
to
take
his
mare
from
him
master
babington
is
here
he
said
he
came
half
an
hour
ago
he
is
in
the
hall
yes
sir
they
are
at
supper
the
hall
at
matstead
was
such
as
that
of
most
esquires
of
means
its
daïs
was
to
the
south
end
and
the
buttery
entrance
and
the
screens
to
the
north
through
which
came
the
servers
with
the
meat
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
stood
the
reredos
with
the
fire
against
it
and
a
round
vent
overhead
in
the
roof
through
which
went
the
smoke
and
came
the
rain
the
tables
stood
down
the
hall
one
on
either
side
with
the
master
table
at
the
daïs
end
set
it
was
not
a
great
hall
though
that
was
its
name
it
ran
perhaps
forty
feet
by
twenty
it
was
lighted
not
only
by
the
fire
that
burned
there
through
the
winter
day
and
night
but
by
eight
torches
in
cressets
that
hung
against
the
walls
and
sadly
smoked
them
and
the
master
table
was
lighted
by
six
candles
of
latten
on
common
days
and
of
silver
upon
festivals
there
were
but
two
at
the
master
table
this
evening
audrey
himself
a
smallish
man
with
bright
blue
eyes
like
his
son
and
no
hair
upon
his
face
for
this
was
the
way
of
old
men
then
in
the
country
at
least
and
anthony
babington
a
young
man
scarcely
a
year
older
than
robin
himself
of
a
brown
complexion
and
a
high
look
in
his
face
but
a
little
pale
too
with
study
for
he
was
learned
beyond
his
years
and
read
all
the
books
that
he
could
lay
hand
to
it
was
said
even
that
his
own
verses
and
a
he
had
written
upon
the
death
of
a
hound
were
read
with
pleasure
in
london
by
the
lords
and
gentlemen
it
was
as
long
ago
as
that
his
verses
had
first
become
known
when
he
was
still
serving
in
the
school
of
good
manners
as
page
in
my
lord
shrewsbury
household
they
were
considered
remarkable
for
so
young
a
boy
so
it
was
to
this
company
that
robin
came
walking
up
between
the
tables
after
he
had
washed
his
hands
at
the
lavatory
that
stood
by
the
screens
you
are
late
lad
said
his
father
i
was
over
to
padley
sir
anthony
then
silence
fell
again
for
it
was
the
custom
in
good
houses
to
keep
silence
or
very
nearly
at
dinner
and
supper
at
times
music
would
play
if
there
was
music
to
be
had
or
a
scholar
would
read
from
a
book
for
awhile
at
the
beginning
from
the
holy
gospels
in
devout
households
or
from
some
other
grave
book
but
if
there
were
neither
music
nor
reading
all
would
hold
their
tongues
robin
was
hungry
from
his
riding
and
the
keen
air
and
he
ate
well
first
he
stayed
his
appetite
a
little
with
a
hunch
of
and
a
glass
of
pomage
while
the
servant
was
bringing
him
his
entry
of
eggs
cooked
with
parsley
then
he
ate
this
and
next
came
half
a
cooked
with
sage
and
sweet
potatoes
and
last
of
all
a
florentine
which
he
ate
with
a
cup
of
canarian
he
ate
heartily
and
quickly
while
the
two
waited
for
him
and
nibbled
at
marchpane
then
when
the
doors
were
flung
open
and
the
troop
of
servants
came
in
to
their
supper
audrey
blessed
himself
and
for
them
too
and
they
went
out
by
a
door
behind
into
the
wainscoted
parlour
where
the
new
stove
from
london
stood
and
where
the
conserves
and
muscadel
awaited
them
for
this
or
like
it
had
been
the
procedure
in
matstead
hall
ever
since
robin
could
remember
when
first
he
had
come
from
the
women
to
eat
his
food
with
the
men
and
how
were
all
at
booth
edge
asked
audrey
when
all
had
pulled
off
their
boots
in
country
fashion
and
were
sitting
each
with
his
glass
beside
him
through
the
door
behind
came
the
clamour
of
the
and
the
keepers
of
the
chase
and
the
servants
over
their
food
i
saw
marjorie
only
sir
said
the
boy
mr
manners
was
in
derby
and
mrs
manners
had
a
megrim
mrs
manners
is
ageing
swifter
than
her
husband
observed
anthony
there
seemed
a
constraint
upon
the
company
this
evening
robin
spoke
of
his
ride
of
things
which
he
had
seen
upon
it
of
a
wood
that
should
be
thinned
next
year
and
anthony
made
a
quip
or
two
such
as
he
was
accustomed
to
make
but
the
master
sat
silent
for
the
most
part
speaking
to
the
lads
once
or
twice
for
civility
sake
but
no
more
and
presently
silences
began
to
fall
that
were
very
unusual
things
in
anthony
company
for
he
had
a
quick
and
a
gay
wit
and
talked
enough
for
five
robin
knew
very
well
what
was
the
matter
it
was
what
lay
upon
his
own
heart
as
heavy
as
lead
but
he
was
sorry
that
the
signs
of
it
should
be
so
evident
and
wondered
what
he
should
say
to
his
friend
anthony
when
the
time
came
for
telling
since
anthony
was
as
ardent
for
the
old
faith
as
any
in
the
land
it
was
a
bitter
time
this
for
the
old
families
that
served
god
as
their
fathers
had
and
desired
to
serve
their
prince
too
for
now
and
again
the
rumour
would
go
abroad
that
another
house
had
fallen
and
another
name
gone
from
the
old
roll
and
what
would
anthony
babington
say
thought
the
lad
when
he
heard
that
audrey
who
had
been
so
hot
and
persevered
so
long
must
be
added
to
these
and
then
on
a
sudden
anthony
himself
opened
on
a
matter
that
was
at
least
cognate
i
was
hearing
from
thomas
fitzherbert
that
his
uncle
would
be
let
out
again
of
the
fleet
soon
to
collect
his
fines
he
spoke
bitterly
and
indeed
there
was
reason
for
not
only
were
the
recusants
as
the
catholics
were
named
put
in
prison
for
their
faith
but
fined
for
it
as
well
and
let
out
of
prison
to
raise
money
for
this
by
selling
their
farms
or
estates
he
will
go
to
norbury
asked
robin
he
will
come
to
padley
too
it
is
thought
her
grace
must
have
her
money
for
her
ships
and
her
men
and
for
her
pursuivants
to
catch
us
all
with
and
it
is
we
that
must
pay
shall
you
sell
again
this
year
sir
audrey
shook
his
head
pursing
up
his
lips
and
staring
upon
the
fire
i
can
sell
no
more
he
said
then
an
agony
seized
upon
robin
lest
his
father
should
say
all
that
was
in
his
mind
he
knew
it
must
be
said
yet
he
feared
its
saying
and
with
a
quick
wit
he
spoke
of
that
which
he
knew
would
divert
his
friend
and
the
queen
of
the
scots
he
said
have
you
heard
more
of
her
now
anthony
babington
was
one
of
those
spirits
that
live
largely
within
themselves
and
therefore
see
that
which
is
without
through
a
haze
or
mist
of
their
own
moods
he
read
much
in
the
poets
you
would
say
that
vergil
and
ovid
as
well
as
the
poets
of
his
own
day
were
his
friends
he
lived
within
surrounded
by
his
own
images
and
therefore
he
loved
and
hated
with
ten
times
the
ardour
of
a
common
man
he
was
furious
for
the
old
faith
furious
against
the
new
he
dreamed
of
wars
and
gallantry
and
splendour
you
could
see
it
even
in
his
dress
in
his
furred
doublet
the
embroideries
at
his
throat
his
rapier
as
well
as
in
his
port
and
countenance
and
the
burning
heart
of
all
his
images
the
mirror
on
earth
of
mary
in
heaven
the
emblem
of
his
piety
the
mistress
of
his
dreams
she
who
embodied
for
him
what
the
courtiers
in
london
protested
that
elizabeth
embodied
for
them
the
pearl
of
great
price
the
one
among
ten
thousand
this
for
him
was
mary
stuart
queen
of
scotland
now
prisoner
in
her
cousin
hands
going
to
and
fro
from
house
to
house
with
a
guard
about
her
yet
with
all
the
seeming
of
liberty
and
none
of
its
reality
the
rough
bitterness
died
out
of
the
boy
face
and
a
look
came
upon
it
as
of
one
who
sees
a
vision
queen
mary
he
said
as
if
he
pronounced
the
name
of
the
mother
of
god
yes
i
have
heard
of
her
she
is
in
norfolk
i
think
then
he
let
flow
out
of
him
the
stream
that
always
ran
in
his
heart
like
sorrowful
music
ever
since
the
day
when
first
as
a
page
in
my
lord
shrewsbury
house
in
sheffield
he
had
set
eyes
on
that
queen
of
sorrows
then
again
upon
the
occasion
of
his
journey
to
paris
he
had
met
with
morgan
her
servant
and
the
bishop
of
glasgow
her
friend
whose
talk
had
excited
and
inspired
him
he
had
learned
from
them
something
more
of
her
glories
and
beauties
and
remembering
what
he
had
seen
of
her
adored
her
the
more
he
leaned
back
now
shading
his
eyes
from
the
candles
upon
the
table
and
began
to
sing
his
love
and
his
queen
he
told
of
new
insults
that
had
been
put
upon
her
new
deprivations
of
what
was
left
to
her
of
liberty
he
did
not
speak
now
of
elizabeth
by
name
since
a
fountain
even
of
talk
should
not
give
out
at
once
sweet
water
and
bitter
but
he
spoke
of
the
day
when
mary
should
come
herself
to
the
throne
of
england
and
take
that
which
was
already
hers
when
the
night
should
roll
away
and
the
arise
and
the
faith
should
come
again
like
the
flowing
tide
and
all
things
be
again
as
they
had
been
from
the
beginning
it
was
rank
treason
that
he
talked
such
as
would
have
brought
him
to
tyburn
if
it
had
been
spoken
in
london
in
indiscreet
company
it
was
that
treason
which
her
grace
herself
had
made
possible
by
her
faithlessness
to
god
and
man
such
treason
as
god
himself
must
have
mercy
upon
since
he
reads
all
hearts
and
their
intentions
the
others
kept
silence
at
the
end
he
stood
up
then
he
stooped
for
his
boots
i
must
be
riding
sir
he
said
audrey
raised
his
hand
to
the
latten
bell
that
stood
beside
him
on
the
table
i
will
take
anthony
to
his
horse
said
robin
suddenly
for
a
thought
had
come
to
him
then
sir
said
anthony
as
he
drew
on
his
second
boot
and
stood
up
the
sky
was
all
ablaze
with
stars
now
as
they
came
out
into
the
court
on
their
right
shone
the
high
windows
of
the
little
hall
where
peace
now
reigned
except
for
the
clatter
of
the
boys
who
took
away
the
dishes
and
the
night
was
very
still
about
them
in
the
grip
of
the
frost
for
the
village
went
early
to
bed
and
even
the
dogs
were
asleep
robin
said
nothing
as
they
went
over
the
paving
for
his
determination
was
not
yet
ripe
and
anthony
was
still
aglow
with
his
own
talk
then
as
the
servant
who
waited
for
his
master
with
the
horses
showed
himself
in
the
with
a
lantern
robin
mind
was
made
up
i
have
something
to
tell
you
he
said
softly
tell
your
man
to
wait
eh
tell
your
man
to
wait
with
the
horses
his
heart
beat
hot
and
thick
in
his
throat
as
he
led
the
way
through
the
screens
and
out
beyond
the
hall
and
down
the
steps
again
into
the
pleasaunce
anthony
took
him
by
the
sleeve
once
or
twice
but
he
said
nothing
and
went
on
across
the
grass
and
out
through
the
open
iron
gate
that
gave
upon
the
woods
he
dared
not
say
what
he
had
to
say
within
the
precincts
of
the
house
for
fear
he
should
be
overheard
and
the
shame
known
before
its
time
then
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
into
the
wood
into
the
dark
out
of
the
starlight
robin
turned
and
as
he
turned
saw
the
windows
of
the
hall
go
black
as
the
boys
extinguished
the
torches
well
whispered
anthony
sharply
for
a
fool
could
see
that
the
news
was
to
be
weighty
and
anthony
was
no
fool
it
was
wonderful
how
robin
thoughts
had
fixed
themselves
since
his
talk
with
mistress
marjorie
he
had
gone
to
padley
doubting
of
what
he
should
say
doubting
what
she
would
tell
him
asking
himself
even
whether
compliance
might
not
be
the
just
as
well
as
the
prudent
way
yet
now
black
shame
had
come
on
him
the
black
shame
that
any
who
was
a
catholic
should
turn
from
his
faith
blacker
that
he
should
so
turn
without
even
a
touch
of
the
rack
or
the
threat
of
it
blackest
of
all
that
it
should
be
his
own
father
who
should
do
this
it
was
partly
food
and
wine
that
had
strengthened
him
partly
anthony
talk
just
now
but
the
frame
and
substance
of
it
all
was
marjorie
and
her
manner
of
speaking
and
her
faith
in
him
and
in
god
he
stood
still
silent
breathing
so
heavily
that
anthony
heard
him
tell
me
rob
tell
me
quickly
robin
drew
a
long
breath
you
saw
that
my
father
was
silent
he
said
yes
stay
will
you
swear
to
me
by
the
mass
that
you
will
tell
no
one
what
you
will
hear
from
me
till
you
hear
it
from
others
i
will
swear
it
whispered
anthony
in
the
darkness
again
robin
sighed
in
a
long
shuddering
breath
anthony
could
hear
him
tremble
with
cold
and
pain
well
he
said
my
father
will
leave
the
church
next
easter
he
is
tired
of
paying
fines
he
says
and
he
has
bidden
me
to
come
with
him
to
matstead
church
there
was
dead
silence
i
went
to
tell
marjorie
whispered
robin
she
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
some
day
so
i
told
her
but
no
one
else
she
has
bidden
me
to
leave
matstead
for
easter
and
pray
to
god
to
show
me
what
to
do
afterwards
can
you
help
me
anthony
he
was
seized
suddenly
by
the
arms
robin
no
no
it
is
not
possible
it
is
certain
i
have
never
known
my
father
to
turn
from
his
word
from
far
away
in
the
wild
woods
came
a
cry
as
the
two
stood
there
it
might
be
a
wolf
or
fox
if
any
were
there
or
some
strange
or
a
woman
in
pain
it
rose
it
seemed
to
a
scream
melancholy
and
dreadful
and
then
died
again
the
two
heard
it
but
said
nothing
one
to
the
other
no
doubt
it
was
some
beast
in
a
snare
or
but
it
chimed
in
with
the
desolation
of
their
hearts
so
as
to
seem
but
a
part
of
it
so
the
two
stood
in
silence
the
house
was
quiet
now
and
most
of
those
within
it
upon
their
beds
only
as
the
two
knew
there
still
sat
in
silence
within
the
little
wainscoted
parlour
with
his
head
on
his
hand
and
a
glass
of
muscadel
beside
him
he
of
whom
they
thought
the
father
of
one
and
the
friend
and
host
of
the
other
it
was
not
until
this
instant
in
the
dark
and
to
the
quiet
with
the
other
lad
hands
still
gripped
on
to
his
arms
that
this
boy
understood
the
utter
shame
and
the
black
misery
of
that
which
he
had
said
and
the
other
heard
chapter
ii
i
there
were
excuses
in
plenty
for
robin
to
ride
abroad
to
the
north
towards
hathersage
or
to
the
south
towards
dethick
as
the
whim
took
him
for
he
was
learning
to
manage
the
estate
that
should
be
his
one
day
at
one
time
it
was
to
quiet
a
yeoman
whose
domain
had
been
ridden
over
and
his
sown
fields
destroyed
at
another
to
dispute
with
a
miller
who
claimed
for
injury
through
floods
for
which
he
held
his
lord
responsible
at
a
third
to
see
to
the
woodland
or
the
fences
broken
by
the
deer
he
came
and
went
then
as
he
willed
and
on
the
second
day
after
anthony
visit
set
out
before
dinner
to
meet
him
that
they
might
speak
at
length
of
what
lay
now
upon
both
their
hearts
to
his
father
he
had
said
no
more
nor
he
to
him
his
father
sat
quiet
in
the
parlour
or
was
in
his
own
chamber
when
robin
was
at
home
but
the
lad
understood
very
well
that
there
was
no
thought
of
yielding
and
there
were
a
dozen
things
on
which
he
himself
must
come
to
a
decision
there
was
the
first
the
question
as
to
where
he
was
to
go
for
easter
and
how
he
was
to
tell
his
father
what
to
do
if
his
father
forbade
him
outright
whether
or
no
the
priests
of
the
district
should
be
told
what
to
do
with
the
chapel
furniture
that
was
kept
in
a
secret
place
in
a
loft
at
matstead
above
all
there
hung
over
him
the
thought
of
what
would
come
after
if
his
father
held
to
his
decision
and
would
allow
him
neither
to
keep
his
religion
at
home
nor
go
elsewhere
on
the
second
day
therefore
he
rode
out
the
frost
still
holding
though
the
sun
was
clear
and
warm
and
turned
southwards
through
the
village
for
the
dethick
road
towards
the
place
in
which
he
had
appointed
to
meet
anthony
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
he
passed
the
minister
barton
coming
out
of
his
house
that
had
been
the
priest
lodging
a
man
made
a
minister
under
the
new
and
therefore
no
priest
as
were
some
of
the
ministers
about
who
had
been
made
priests
under
mary
he
was
a
solid
man
of
no
great
wit
or
learning
but
there
was
not
an
ounce
of
harm
in
him
they
were
fortunate
indeed
to
have
such
a
minister
since
many
parishes
had
but
laymen
to
read
the
services
and
in
one
not
twenty
miles
away
the
squire
falconer
held
the
living
barton
was
in
his
cloak
and
round
cap
and
saluted
robin
heartily
in
his
loud
bellowing
voice
riding
abroad
again
he
cried
on
some
secret
errand
i
will
give
your
respects
to
babington
said
robin
smiling
heavily
i
am
to
meet
him
about
a
matter
of
a
tithe
too
ah
you
papists
would
starve
us
altogether
if
you
could
roared
the
minister
who
wished
no
better
than
to
be
at
peace
with
his
neighbours
and
was
all
for
liberty
you
will
get
your
tithe
safe
enough
one
of
you
at
least
said
robin
it
is
but
a
matter
as
to
who
shall
pay
it
he
waved
to
the
minister
and
set
his
horse
to
the
dethick
track
there
was
no
going
fast
along
this
country
road
the
frosts
and
the
thaws
had
made
of
it
a
very
way
of
sorrows
here
in
the
harder
parts
was
a
tumble
of
ridges
and
holes
with
edges
as
hard
as
steel
here
in
the
softer
the
faggots
laid
to
build
it
up
were
broken
or
rotted
through
making
it
no
better
than
a
trap
for
horses
feet
and
it
was
a
full
hour
before
robin
finished
his
four
miles
and
turned
up
through
the
winter
woodland
to
the
yeoman
farm
where
he
was
to
meet
anthony
it
was
true
as
he
had
said
to
barton
that
they
were
to
speak
of
a
matter
of
tithe
this
was
to
be
their
excuse
if
his
father
questioned
him
for
there
was
a
doubt
as
to
in
which
parish
stood
this
farm
for
the
yeoman
tilled
three
meadows
that
were
in
the
babington
estate
and
two
in
matstead
as
he
came
up
the
broken
ground
on
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
he
saw
anthony
come
out
of
the
and
the
yeoman
with
him
then
anthony
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
down
towards
him
bidding
the
man
stay
over
his
shoulder
it
is
all
plain
enough
shouted
anthony
loud
enough
for
the
man
to
hear
it
is
dethick
that
must
pay
you
need
not
come
up
robin
we
must
do
the
paying
robin
checked
his
mare
and
waited
till
the
other
came
near
enough
to
speak
young
thomas
fitzherbert
is
within
he
is
riding
round
his
new
estates
said
the
other
beneath
his
breath
i
thought
i
would
come
out
and
tell
you
and
i
do
not
know
where
we
can
talk
or
dine
i
met
him
on
the
road
and
he
would
come
with
me
he
is
eating
his
dinner
there
but
i
must
eat
my
dinner
too
said
robin
in
dismay
will
you
tell
him
of
what
you
have
told
me
he
is
safe
and
discreet
i
think
why
yes
if
you
think
so
said
robin
i
do
not
know
him
very
well
oh
he
is
safe
enough
and
he
has
learned
not
to
talk
besides
all
the
country
will
know
it
by
easter
so
they
turned
their
horses
back
again
and
rode
up
to
the
farm
it
was
a
great
day
for
a
yeoman
when
three
gentlemen
should
take
their
dinners
in
his
house
and
the
place
was
in
a
respectful
uproar
from
the
kitchen
vent
went
up
a
pillar
of
smoke
and
through
its
door
in
and
out
continually
fled
maids
with
dishes
the
yeoman
himself
john
merton
a
lean
man
stood
cap
in
hand
to
meet
the
gentlemen
and
his
wife
from
the
fire
peeped
and
smiled
from
the
open
door
of
the
that
gave
immediately
upon
the
yard
for
these
gentlemen
were
from
three
of
the
principal
estates
here
about
the
babingtons
had
their
country
house
at
dethick
and
their
town
house
in
derby
the
audreys
owned
a
matter
of
fifteen
hundred
acres
at
least
all
about
matstead
and
the
fitzherberts
it
was
said
scarcely
knew
themselves
all
that
they
owned
or
rather
all
that
had
been
theirs
until
the
queen
grace
had
begun
to
strip
them
of
it
little
by
little
on
account
of
their
faith
the
two
padleys
at
least
were
theirs
besides
their
principal
house
at
norbury
and
now
that
sir
thomas
was
in
the
fleet
prison
for
his
religion
young
thomas
his
heir
was
of
more
account
than
ever
he
was
at
his
dinner
when
the
two
came
in
and
he
rose
and
saluted
them
he
was
a
smallish
kind
of
man
with
a
little
brown
beard
and
his
short
hair
when
he
lifted
his
flapped
cap
to
them
showed
upright
on
his
head
he
smiled
pleasantly
enough
and
made
space
for
them
to
sit
down
one
at
each
side
we
shall
do
very
well
now
merton
he
said
if
you
will
bring
in
that
goose
once
more
for
these
gentlemen
then
he
made
excuses
for
beginning
his
dinner
before
them
he
was
on
his
way
home
and
must
be
off
again
presently
it
was
a
table
for
a
yeoman
house
there
was
a
linen
napkin
for
each
guest
one
corner
of
which
he
tucked
into
his
throat
while
the
other
corner
lay
beneath
his
wooden
plate
the
twelve
silver
spoons
were
laid
out
on
the
smooth
and
a
silver
salt
stood
before
thomas
there
was
of
course
an
abundance
to
eat
and
drink
even
though
no
more
than
two
had
been
expected
and
john
merton
himself
stood
hatless
on
the
further
side
of
the
table
and
took
the
dishes
from
the
maids
to
place
them
before
the
gentlemen
there
was
a
jack
of
metheglin
for
each
to
drink
and
a
huge
loaf
of
miscelin
or
bread
made
of
mingled
corn
stood
in
the
midst
and
beyond
the
salt
they
talked
of
this
and
of
that
and
of
the
other
freely
and
easily
of
thomas
marriage
with
mistress
westley
that
was
to
take
place
presently
of
the
new
entailment
of
the
estates
made
upon
him
by
his
uncle
john
merton
inquired
as
was
right
after
sir
thomas
and
openly
shook
his
head
when
he
heard
of
his
sufferings
for
he
and
his
wife
were
as
good
catholics
as
any
in
the
country
and
when
the
room
was
empty
for
a
moment
of
the
maids
spoke
of
a
priest
who
he
had
been
told
would
say
mass
in
tansley
next
day
for
it
was
in
this
way
for
the
most
part
that
such
news
was
carried
from
mouth
to
mouth
then
when
the
maids
came
in
again
the
battle
of
the
tithe
was
fought
once
more
and
thomas
pronounced
sentence
for
the
second
time
they
blessed
themselves
all
four
of
them
openly
at
the
end
and
went
out
at
last
to
their
horses
will
you
ride
with
us
sir
asked
anthony
we
can
go
your
way
robin
here
has
something
to
say
to
you
i
shall
be
happy
if
you
will
give
me
your
company
for
a
little
i
must
be
at
padley
before
dark
if
i
can
and
must
visit
a
couple
of
houses
on
the
way
he
called
out
to
his
two
servants
who
ran
out
from
the
kitchen
wiping
their
mouths
telling
them
to
follow
at
once
and
the
three
rode
off
down
the
hill
then
robin
told
him
he
was
silent
for
a
while
after
he
had
put
a
question
or
two
biting
his
lower
lip
a
little
and
putting
his
little
beard
into
his
mouth
then
he
burst
out
and
i
dare
not
ask
you
to
come
to
me
for
easter
he
said
god
only
knows
where
i
shall
be
at
easter
i
shall
be
married
too
by
then
my
father
is
in
london
now
and
may
send
for
me
my
uncle
is
in
the
fleet
i
am
here
now
only
to
see
what
money
i
can
raise
for
the
fines
and
for
the
solace
of
my
uncle
i
can
not
ask
you
audrey
though
god
knows
that
i
would
do
anything
that
i
could
have
you
nowhere
to
go
will
your
father
hold
to
what
he
says
robin
told
him
yes
and
he
added
that
there
were
four
or
five
places
he
could
go
to
he
was
not
asking
for
help
or
harbourage
but
advice
only
and
even
of
that
i
have
none
cried
thomas
i
need
all
that
i
can
get
myself
i
am
distracted
babington
with
all
these
troubles
robin
asked
him
whether
the
priests
who
came
and
went
should
be
told
of
the
blow
that
impended
for
at
those
times
every
apostasy
was
of
importance
to
priests
who
had
to
run
here
and
there
for
shelter
i
will
tell
one
or
two
of
the
more
discreet
ones
myself
said
thomas
if
you
will
give
me
leave
i
would
that
they
were
all
discreet
but
they
are
not
we
will
name
no
names
if
you
please
but
some
of
them
are
unreasonable
altogether
and
think
nothing
of
bringing
us
all
into
peril
he
began
to
bite
his
beard
again
do
you
think
the
commissioners
will
visit
us
again
asked
anthony
fenton
was
telling
me
it
is
fenton
and
the
like
that
will
bring
them
down
on
us
if
any
will
burst
out
fitzherbert
peevishly
i
am
as
good
a
catholic
i
hope
as
any
in
the
world
but
we
can
surely
live
without
the
sacraments
for
a
month
or
two
sometimes
but
it
is
this
perpetual
coming
and
going
of
priests
that
enrages
her
grace
and
her
counsellors
i
do
not
believe
her
grace
has
any
great
enmity
against
us
but
she
soon
will
if
men
like
fenton
and
bassett
are
for
ever
harbouring
priests
and
encouraging
them
it
is
the
same
in
london
i
hear
it
is
the
same
in
lancashire
it
is
the
same
everywhere
and
all
the
world
knows
it
and
thinks
that
we
do
contemn
her
grace
by
such
boldness
all
the
mischief
came
in
with
that
old
bull
in
in
and
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
came
in
a
quiet
voice
from
beyond
him
and
robin
looking
across
saw
anthony
with
a
face
as
if
frozen
pooh
pooh
burst
out
thomas
with
an
uneasy
air
the
holy
father
i
take
it
may
make
mistakes
as
i
understand
it
in
such
matters
as
well
as
any
man
why
a
dozen
priests
have
said
to
me
they
thought
it
inopportune
and
i
do
not
permit
said
anthony
with
an
air
of
dignity
beyond
his
years
that
any
man
should
speak
so
in
my
company
well
well
you
are
too
hot
altogether
babington
i
admire
such
zeal
indeed
as
i
do
in
the
saints
but
we
are
not
bound
to
imitate
all
that
we
admire
say
no
more
sir
and
i
will
say
no
more
either
they
rode
in
silence
it
was
indeed
one
of
those
matters
that
were
in
dispute
at
that
time
amongst
the
catholics
the
pope
was
not
swift
enough
for
some
and
too
swift
for
others
he
had
thundered
too
soon
said
one
party
if
indeed
it
was
right
to
thunder
at
all
and
not
to
wait
in
patience
till
the
queen
grace
should
repent
herself
and
he
had
thundered
not
soon
enough
said
the
other
whence
it
may
at
least
be
argued
that
he
had
been
exactly
opportune
yet
it
could
not
be
denied
that
since
the
day
when
he
had
declared
elizabeth
cut
off
from
the
unity
of
the
church
and
her
subjects
absolved
from
their
allegiance
though
never
as
some
pretended
then
and
have
pretended
ever
since
that
a
private
person
might
kill
her
and
do
no
wrong
ever
since
that
day
her
bitterness
had
increased
yearly
against
her
catholic
people
who
desired
no
better
than
to
serve
both
her
and
their
god
if
she
would
but
permit
that
to
be
possible
ii
it
would
be
an
hour
later
that
they
bid
to
thomas
fitzherbert
high
among
the
hills
to
the
east
of
the
derwent
river
and
when
they
had
seen
him
ride
off
towards
wingerworth
rode
yet
a
few
furlongs
together
to
speak
of
what
had
been
said
he
can
do
nothing
then
said
robin
not
even
to
give
good
counsel
i
have
never
heard
him
speak
so
before
cried
anthony
he
must
be
near
mad
i
think
it
must
be
his
marriage
i
suppose
he
is
full
of
his
own
troubles
that
is
plain
enough
without
seeking
others
well
i
must
bear
mine
as
best
i
can
they
were
just
parting
anthony
to
ride
back
to
dethick
and
robin
over
the
moors
to
matstead
when
over
a
rise
in
the
ground
they
saw
the
heads
of
three
horsemen
approaching
it
was
a
wild
country
that
they
were
in
there
were
no
houses
in
sight
and
in
such
circumstances
it
was
but
prudent
to
remain
together
until
the
character
of
the
travellers
should
be
plain
so
the
two
after
a
word
rode
gently
forward
hearing
the
voices
of
the
three
talking
to
one
another
in
the
still
air
though
without
catching
a
word
for
as
they
came
nearer
the
voices
ceased
as
if
the
talkers
feared
to
be
overheard
they
were
well
mounted
these
three
on
horses
known
as
scottish
nags
sturdy
beasts
that
could
cover
forty
miles
in
the
day
they
were
splashed
too
not
the
horses
only
but
the
riders
also
as
if
they
had
ridden
far
through
streams
or
boggy
ground
the
men
were
dressed
soberly
and
well
like
poor
gentlemen
or
prosperous
yeomen
all
three
were
bearded
and
all
carried
arms
as
could
be
seen
from
the
flash
of
the
sun
on
their
hilts
it
was
plain
too
that
they
were
not
rogues
or
cutters
since
each
carried
his
valise
on
his
saddle
as
well
as
from
their
appearance
our
gentlemen
then
after
passing
them
with
a
salute
and
a
were
once
more
about
to
say
one
to
the
other
and
appoint
a
time
and
place
to
meet
again
for
the
hunting
of
which
robin
had
spoken
to
marjorie
and
indeed
had
drawn
rein
when
one
of
the
three
strangers
was
seen
to
turn
his
horse
and
come
riding
back
after
them
while
his
friends
waited
the
two
lads
wheeled
about
to
meet
him
as
was
but
prudent
but
while
he
was
yet
twenty
yards
away
he
lifted
his
hat
he
seemed
about
thirty
years
old
he
had
a
pleasant
ruddy
face
babington
i
think
sir
he
said
that
is
my
name
said
anthony
i
have
heard
mass
in
your
house
sir
said
the
stranger
my
name
is
garlick
why
yes
sir
i
remember
from
tideswell
how

garlick
this
is
audrey
of
matstead
they
saluted
one
another
gravely
audrey

a
catholic

i
think
robin
answered
that
he
was
then
i

news

you
gentlemen

reverence

pleasure

said
anthony
touching
his
horse
with
his
heel
i
am
bringing
simpson

his
way
he
is
just
fresh
from
rheims
and
ludlam

continued
garlick
as
they
went
forward
mr
ludlam
he
is
a
native
of
radbourne
and
has
but
just
finished
at
oxford
forgive
me
sir
i
will
but
just
ride
forward
and
tell
them
the
two
lads
drew
rein
seeing
that
he
wished
first
to
tell
the
others
who
they
were
before
bringing
them
up
and
a
strange
little
thing
fell
as
garlick
joined
the
two
for
it
happened
that
by
now
the
sun
was
at
his
setting
going
down
in
a
glory
of
crimson
over
the
edge
of
the
high
moor
and
that
the
three
riders
were
directly
in
his
path
from
where
the
two
lads
waited
robin
therefore
looking
at
them
saw
the
three
all
together
on
their
horses
with
the
circle
of
the
sun
about
them
and
a
great
flood
of
light
on
every
side
the
priest
was
in
the
midst
of
the
three
and
the
two
men
leaning
towards
him
seemed
to
be
speaking
and
as
if
encouraging
him
strongly
for
an
instant
so
strange
was
the
light
so
immense
the
shadows
on
this
side
spread
over
the
tumbled
ground
up
to
the
lads
themselves
so
vast
the
great
vault
of
illuminated
sky
that
it
seemed
to
robin
as
if
he
saw
a
vision
then
the
strangeness
passed
as
garlick
turned
away
again
to
beckon
to
them
and
the
boy
thought
no
more
of
it
at
that
time
they
uncovered
as
they
rode
towards
the
priest
and
bowed
low
to
him
as
he
lifted
his
hand
with
a
few
words
of
latin
and
the
next
instant
they
were
in
talk
simpson
like
his
friends
was
a
youngish
man
at
this
time
with
a
kind
face
and
great
innocent
eyes
that
seemed
to
wonder
and
question
ludlam
too
was
under
thirty
years
old
plainly
not
of
birth
though
he
was
courteous
and
it
seemed
a
great
matter
to
these
three
to
have
fallen
in
with
young
babington
whose
family
was
so
and
whose
own
fame
as
a
scholar
as
well
as
an
ardent
catholic
was
all
over
the
county
robin
said
little
he
was
overshadowed
by
his
friend
but
he
listened
and
watched
as
the
four
spoke
together
and
learned
that
simpson
had
been
made
priest
scarcely
a
month
before
and
was
come
from
yorkshire
which
was
his
own
county
to
minister
in
the
district
of
the
peak
at
least
for
awhile
he
heard
too
news
from
douay
and
that
the
college
it
was
thought
might
move
from
there
to
another
place
under
the
protection
of
the
family
of
de
guise
since
her
grace
was
very
hot
against
douay
whence
so
many
of
her
troubles
proceeded
and
was
doing
her
best
to
persuade
the
governor
of
the
netherlands
to
suppress
it
however
said
simpson
it
was
not
yet
done
anthony
too
in
his
turn
gave
the
news
of
the
county
he
spoke
of
fenton
of
the
fitzherberts
and
others
that
were
safe
and
discreet
persons
but
he
said
nothing
at
that
time
of
audrey
of
matstead
at
which
robin
was
glad
since
his
shame
deepened
on
him
every
hour
and
all
the
more
now
that
he
had
met
with
those
three
men
who
rode
so
gallantly
through
the
country
in
peril
of
liberty
or
life
itself
nor
did
he
say
anything
of
the
fitzherberts
except
that
they
might
be
relied
upon
we
must
be
riding
said
garlick
at
last
these
moors
are
strange
to
me
and
it
will
be
dark
in
half
an
hour
will
you
allow
me
to
be
your
guide
sir
asked
anthony
of
the
priest
it
is
all
in
my
road
and
you
will
not
be
troubled
with
questions
or
answers
if
you
are
in
my
company
but
what
of
your
friend
sir
oh
robin
knows
the
country
as
he
knows
the
flat
of
his
hand
we
were
about
to
separate
as
we
met
you
then
we
will
thankfully
accept
your
guidance
sir
said
the
priest
gravely
an
impulse
seized
upon
robin
as
he
was
about
to
say
though
he
was
ashamed
of
it
five
minutes
later
as
a
modest
lad
would
be
yet
he
followed
it
now
he
leapt
off
his
horse
and
holding
cecily
rein
in
his
arm
kneeled
on
the
stones
with
both
knees
your
blessing
sir
he
said
to
the
priest
and
anthony
eyed
him
with
astonishment
iii
robin
was
moved
as
he
rode
home
over
the
high
moors
and
down
at
last
upon
the
woods
of
matstead
in
a
manner
that
was
new
to
him
and
that
he
could
not
altogether
understand
he
had
met
travelling
priests
before
indeed
all
the
priests
whose
masses
he
had
ever
heard
or
from
whom
he
had
received
the
sacraments
were
travelling
priests
who
went
in
peril
and
yet
this
young
man
upon
whose
consecrated
hands
the
oil
was
scarcely
yet
dry
moved
and
drew
his
heart
in
a
manner
that
he
had
never
yet
known
it
was
perhaps
something
in
the
priest
face
that
had
so
affected
him
for
there
was
a
look
in
it
of
a
kind
of
surprised
timidity
and
gentleness
as
if
he
wondered
at
himself
for
being
so
foolhardy
and
as
if
he
appealed
with
that
same
wonder
and
surprise
to
all
who
looked
on
him
his
voice
too
was
gentle
as
if
tamed
for
the
seminary
and
the
altar
and
his
whole
air
and
manner
wholly
unlike
that
of
some
of
the
priests
whom
robin
knew
confident
burly
men
whom
you
would
have
sworn
to
be
country
gentlemen
or
yeomen
living
on
their
estates
or
farms
and
fearing
to
look
no
man
in
the
face
it
was
this
latter
kind
thought
robin
that
was
best
suited
to
such
a
life
to
riding
all
day
through
storms
to
lodging
hardily
where
they
best
could
to
living
such
a
desperate
enterprise
as
a
life
then
was
with
prices
upon
their
heads
and
spies
everywhere
it
was
not
a
life
for
quiet
persons
like
simpson
who
surely
would
be
better
at
his
books
in
some
college
abroad
offering
the
holy
sacrifice
in
peace
and
security
and
praying
for
adventurers
more
hardy
than
himself
yet
here
was
simpson
just
set
out
upon
such
an
adventure
of
his
own
and
choice
with
no
compulsion
save
that
of
grace
there
was
yet
more
than
an
hour
before
when
he
rode
into
the
court
at
last
and
dick
sampson
his
own
groom
came
to
take
his
horse
from
him
the
master
not
been
from
home
sir
said
dick
when
robin
asked
of
his
father
not
been
from
home
no
sir
not
out
of
the
house
except
that
he
was
walking
in
the
pleasaunce
half
an
hour
ago
robin
ran
up
the
steps
and
through
the
screens
to
see
if
his
father
was
still
there
but
the
little
walled
garden
so
far
as
he
could
see
it
in
the
light
from
the
hall
windows
was
empty
and
indeed
it
would
be
strange
for
any
man
to
walk
in
such
a
place
at
such
an
hour
he
wondered
too
to
hear
that
his
father
had
not
been
from
home
for
on
all
days
except
he
were
ill
he
would
be
about
the
estate
here
and
there
as
he
came
back
to
the
screens
he
heard
a
step
going
up
and
down
in
the
hall
and
on
looking
in
met
his
father
face
to
face
the
old
man
had
his
hat
on
his
head
but
no
cloak
on
his
shoulders
though
even
with
the
fire
the
place
was
cold
it
was
plain
that
he
had
been
walking
up
and
down
to
warm
himself
robin
could
not
make
out
his
face
very
well
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
a
torch
where
have
you
been
my
lad
i
went
to
meet
anthony
at
one
of
the
dethick
farms
sir
john
merton
you
met
no
one
else
yes
sir
thomas
fitzherbert
was
there
and
dined
with
us
he
rode
with
us
too
a
little
way
and
then
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
of
the
priest
he
stopped
himself
and
in
an
instant
knew
that
never
again
must
he
speak
of
a
priest
to
his
father
his
father
had
already
lost
his
right
to
that
his
father
looked
at
him
a
moment
standing
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
have
you
heard
anything
of
a
priest
that
is
newly
come
to
these
parts
or
coming
yes
sir
i
hear
mass
is
to
be
said
in
the
district
on
sunday
where
is
mass
to
be
said
robin
drew
along
breath
lifted
his
eyes
to
his
father
and
then
dropped
them
again
did
you
hear
me
sir
where
is
mass
to
be
said
again
robin
lifted
and
again
dropped
his
eyes
what
is
the
priest
name
again
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
son
in
those
days
so
to
behave
towards
his
father
was
an
act
of
very
defiance
yet
the
father
said
nothing
there
the
two
remained
robin
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
expecting
a
storm
of
words
or
a
blow
in
the
face
yet
he
knew
he
could
do
no
otherwise
the
moment
had
come
at
last
and
he
must
act
as
he
would
be
obliged
always
to
act
hereafter
matters
had
matured
swiftly
in
the
boy
mind
all
unconsciously
to
himself
perhaps
it
was
the
timid
air
of
the
priest
he
had
met
an
hour
ago
that
consummated
the
process
at
least
it
was
so
consummated
then
his
father
turned
suddenly
on
his
heel
and
the
son
went
out
trembling
chapter
iii
i
i
will
speak
to
you
sir
after
supper
said
his
father
sharply
a
second
day
later
when
robin
meeting
his
father
setting
out
before
dinner
had
asked
him
to
give
him
an
hour
talk
robin
mind
had
worked
fiercely
and
intently
since
the
encounter
in
the
hall
his
father
had
sat
silent
both
at
supper
and
afterwards
and
the
next
day
was
the
same
the
old
man
spoke
no
more
than
was
necessary
shortly
and
abruptly
scarcely
looking
his
son
once
in
the
face
and
the
rest
of
the
day
they
had
not
met
it
was
plain
to
the
boy
that
something
must
follow
his
defiance
and
he
had
prepared
all
his
fortitude
to
meet
it
yet
the
second
night
had
passed
and
no
word
had
been
spoken
and
by
the
second
morning
robin
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
must
know
what
was
in
his
father
mind
and
now
the
appointment
was
made
and
he
would
soon
know
all
his
father
was
absent
from
dinner
and
the
boy
dined
alone
he
learned
from
dick
sampson
that
his
father
had
ridden
southwards
it
was
not
until
robin
had
sat
down
nearly
half
an
hour
later
than
that
the
old
man
came
in
the
frost
was
gone
deep
mud
had
succeeded
and
the
rider
was
splashed
above
his
thighs
he
stayed
at
the
fire
for
his
boots
to
be
drawn
off
and
to
put
on
his
shoes
while
robin
stood
up
dutifully
to
await
him
then
he
came
forward
took
his
seat
without
a
word
and
called
for
supper
in
ominous
silence
the
meal
proceeded
and
with
the
same
thunderous
air
when
it
was
over
his
father
said
grace
and
made
his
way
followed
by
his
son
into
the
parlour
behind
he
made
no
motion
at
first
to
pour
out
his
wine
then
he
helped
himself
twice
and
left
the
jug
for
robin
then
suddenly
he
began
without
moving
his
head
i
wish
to
know
your
intentions
he
said
with
irony
so
serious
that
it
seemed
gravity
i
can
not
flog
you
or
put
you
to
school
again
and
i
must
know
how
we
stand
to
one
another
robin
was
silent
he
had
looked
at
his
father
once
or
twice
but
now
sat
downcast
and
humble
in
his
place
with
his
left
hand
he
fumbled
out
of
sight
maine
pair
of
beads
his
father
for
his
part
sat
with
his
feet
stretched
to
the
fire
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
not
doing
enough
courtesy
to
his
son
even
to
look
at
him
do
you
hear
me
sir
yes
sir
but
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
i
wish
to
know
your
intentions
do
you
mean
to
thwart
and
disobey
me
in
all
matters
or
in
only
those
that
have
to
do
with
religion
i
do
not
wish
to
thwart
or
disobey
you
sir
in
any
matters
except
where
my
conscience
is
touched
the
substance
of
this
answer
had
been
previously
rehearsed
and
the
latter
part
of
it
even
verbally
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
that
robin
licked
his
lips
carefully
and
sat
up
a
little
in
his
chair
you
told
me
sir
that
it
was
your
intention
to
leave
the
church
then
how
can
i
tell
you
of
what
priests
are
here
or
where
mass
is
to
be
said
you
would
not
have
done
so
to
one
who
was
not
a
catholic
six
months
ago
the
man
sneered
visibly
there
is
no
need
he
said
it
is
simpson
who
is
to
say
mass
and
it
is
at
tansley
that
it
will
be
said
at
six
in
the
morning
if
i
choose
to
tell
the
justices
you
can
not
prevent
it
he
turned
round
in
a
flare
of
anger
do
you
think
i
shall
tell
the
justices
robin
said
nothing
do
you
think
i
shall
tell
the
justices
roared
the
old
man
insistently
no
sir
now
i
do
not
the
other
growled
gently
and
sank
back
but
if
you
think
that
i
will
permit
my
son
to
flout
and
to
my
face
in
my
own
hall
and
not
to
trust
his
own
father
why
you
are
immeasurably
mistaken
sir
so
i
ask
you
again
how
far
you
intend
to
thwart
and
disobey
me
a
kind
of
despair
surged
up
in
the
boy
heart
despair
at
the
fruitlessness
of
this
ironical
and
furious
sort
of
talk
and
with
the
despair
came
boldness
father
will
you
let
me
speak
outright
without
thinking
that
i
mean
to
insult
you
i
do
not
i
swear
i
do
not
will
you
let
me
speak
sir
his
father
growled
again
a
sort
of
acquiescence
and
robin
gathered
his
forces
he
had
prepared
a
kind
of
defence
that
seemed
to
him
reasonable
and
he
knew
that
his
father
was
at
least
just
they
had
been
friends
these
two
always
in
an
underground
sort
of
way
which
was
all
that
the
relations
of
father
and
son
in
such
days
allowed
the
old
man
was
curt
obstinate
and
even
boisterous
in
his
anger
but
there
was
a
kindliness
beneath
that
the
boy
always
perceived
a
kindliness
which
permitted
the
son
an
exceptional
freedom
of
speech
which
he
used
always
in
the
last
resort
and
which
he
knew
his
father
loved
to
hear
him
use
this
then
was
plainly
a
legitimate
occasion
for
it
and
he
had
prepared
himself
to
make
the
most
of
it
he
began
formally
sir
he
said
you
have
brought
me
up
in
the
old
faith
sent
me
to
mass
and
to
the
priest
to
learn
my
duty
and
i
have
obeyed
you
always
you
have
taught
me
that
a
man
duty
to
god
must
come
before
all
else
as
our
saviour
himself
said
too
and
now
you
turn
on
me
and
bid
me
forget
all
that
and
come
to
church
with
you
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
anything
to
my
father
about
his
own
conscience
i
must
leave
that
alone
but
i
am
bound
to
speak
of
mine
when
occasion
rises
and
this
is
one
of
them
i
should
be
dishonouring
and
insulting
you
sir
if
i
did
not
believe
you
when
you
said
you
would
turn
protestant
and
a
man
who
says
he
will
turn
protestant
has
done
so
already
it
was
for
this
reason
then
and
no
other
that
i
did
not
answer
you
the
other
day
not
because
i
wish
to
be
disobedient
to
you
but
because
i
must
be
obedient
to
god
i
did
not
lie
to
you
as
i
might
have
done
and
say
that
i
did
not
know
who
the
priest
was
nor
where
mass
was
to
be
said
but
i
would
not
answer
because
it
is
not
right
or
discreet
for
a
catholic
to
speak
of
these
things
to
those
who
are
not
catholics
how
dare
you
say
i
am
not
a
catholic
sir
a
catholic
sir
to
my
mind
said
robin
steadily
is
one
who
holds
to
the
catholic
church
and
to
no
other
i
mean
nothing
offensive
sir
i
mean
what
i
said
i
meant
and
no
more
it
is
not
for
me
to
condemn
i
should
think
not
snorted
the
old
man
well
sir
that
is
my
reason
and
further
he
stopped
doubtful
well
sir
what
further
well
i
can
not
come
to
the
church
with
you
at
easter
his
father
wheeled
round
savagely
in
his
chair
father
hear
me
out
and
then
say
what
you
will
i
say
i
can
not
come
with
you
to
church
at
easter
because
i
am
a
catholic
but
i
do
not
wish
to
trouble
or
disobey
you
openly
i
will
go
away
from
home
for
that
time
good
barton
will
cause
no
trouble
he
wants
nothing
but
peace
father
you
are
not
just
to
me
you
have
taught
me
too
much
or
you
have
not
given
me
time
enough
again
he
broke
off
knowing
that
he
had
said
what
he
did
not
mean
but
the
old
man
was
on
him
like
a
hawk
not
time
enough
you
say
well
then
no
sir
i
did
not
mean
that
wailed
robin
suddenly
i
do
not
mean
that
i
should
change
if
i
had
a
hundred
years
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
but
you
said
time
enough
said
the
other
meditatively
perhaps
if
i
give
you
time
father
i
beg
of
you
to
forget
what
i
said
i
did
not
mean
to
say
it
it
is
not
true
but
marjorie
said
marjorie
what
has
marjorie
to
do
with
it
robin
found
himself
suddenly
in
deep
waters
he
had
plunged
and
found
that
he
could
not
swim
this
was
the
second
mistake
he
had
made
in
saying
what
he
did
not
mean
again
the
courage
of
despair
came
to
him
and
he
struck
out
further
i
must
tell
you
of
that
too
sir
he
said
mistress
marjorie
and
i
he
stopped
overwhelmed
with
shame
his
father
turned
full
round
and
stared
at
him
go
on
sir
robin
seized
his
glass
and
emptied
it
well
sir
mistress
marjorie
and
i
love
one
another
we
are
but
boy
and
girl
sir
we
know
that
then
his
father
laughed
it
was
laughter
that
was
at
once
hearty
and
bitter
and
with
it
came
the
closing
of
the
open
door
in
the
heart
as
there
came
out
after
it
sentence
after
sentence
of
scorn
and
contempt
the
bolts
so
to
say
were
shot
and
the
key
turned
it
might
all
have
been
otherwise
if
the
elder
man
had
been
kind
or
if
he
had
been
sad
or
disappointed
or
even
if
he
had
been
merely
angry
but
the
soreness
and
misery
in
the
old
man
heart
misery
at
his
own
acts
and
words
and
at
the
outrage
he
was
doing
to
his
own
conscience
turned
his
judgment
bitter
and
with
that
bitterness
his
son
heart
shut
tight
against
him
but
boy
and
girl
sneered
the
man
a
couple
of
blind
puppies
i
would
say
rather
you
with
your
falcons
and
mare
and
your
other
toys
and
the
down
on
your
chin
and
your
conscience
and
she
with
her
white
face
and
her
mother
and
her
and
her
beads
his
charity
prevailed
so
far
as
to
hinder
him
from
more
outspoken
contempt
and
you
two
babes
have
been
prattling
of
conscience
and
prayers
together
i
make
no
doubt
and
thinking
yourselves
cecilies
and
laurences
and
all
the
holy
martyrs
and
all
this
without
a
i
dare
wager
from
parent
or
father
and
thinking
yourselves
man
and
wife
and
you
fondling
her
and
she
too
modest
to
be
fondled
and
the
plain
truth
struck
him
with
sudden
splendour
at
least
sufficiently
strong
to
furnish
him
with
a
question
and
have
you
told
mistress
marjorie
about
your
sad
rogue
of
a
father
robin
white
with
anger
held
his
lips
grimly
together
and
the
wrath
blazed
in
an
instant
up
from
the
scornful
old
heart
whose
very
love
was
turned
to
gall
tell
me
sir
i
will
have
it
he
cried
robin
looked
at
him
with
such
hard
fury
in
his
eyes
that
for
a
moment
the
man
winced
then
he
recovered
himself
and
again
his
anger
rose
to
the
brim
you
need
not
look
at
me
like
that
you
hound
tell
me
i
say
i
will
not
shouted
robin
springing
to
his
feet
the
old
man
was
up
too
by
now
with
all
the
anger
of
his
son
hardened
by
his
dignity
you
will
not
no
for
a
moment
the
fate
of
them
both
still
hung
in
the
balance
if
even
at
this
instant
the
father
had
remembered
his
love
rather
than
his
dignity
had
thought
of
the
past
and
its
happy
years
rather
than
of
the
blinding
swollen
present
or
on
the
other
side
if
the
son
had
but
submitted
if
only
for
an
hour
and
obeyed
in
order
that
he
might
rule
later
the
whole
course
might
have
run
aright
and
no
hearts
have
been
broken
and
no
blood
shed
but
neither
would
yield
there
was
the
fierce
northern
obstinacy
in
them
both
the
gentle
birth
sharpened
its
edge
the
defiant
refusal
of
the
son
the
wounding
contempt
of
the
father
not
for
his
son
only
but
for
his
son
love
these
things
inflamed
the
hearts
of
both
to
madness
the
father
seized
his
ultimate
right
and
struck
his
son
across
the
face
then
the
son
answered
by
his
only
weapon
for
a
sensible
pause
he
stood
there
his
fresh
face
paled
to
chalkiness
except
where
the
print
of
five
fingers
slowly
reddened
then
he
made
a
courteous
little
gesture
as
if
to
invite
his
father
to
sit
down
and
as
the
other
did
so
slowly
and
shaking
all
over
struck
at
him
by
careful
and
calculated
words
delivered
with
a
stilted
and
pompous
air
you
have
beaten
me
sir
so
of
course
i
obey
yes
i
told
mistress
marjorie
manners
that
my
father
no
longer
counted
himself
a
catholic
and
would
publicly
turn
protestant
at
easter
so
as
to
please
her
grace
and
be
in
favour
with
the
court
and
with
the
county
justices
and
i
have
told
babington
so
as
well
and
also
thomas
fitzherbert
it
will
spare
you
the
pain
sir
of
making
any
public
announcement
on
the
matter
it
is
always
a
son
duty
to
spare
his
father
pain
then
he
bowed
wheeled
and
went
out
of
the
room
ii
two
hours
later
robin
was
still
lying
completely
dressed
on
his
bed
in
the
dark
it
was
a
plain
little
chamber
where
he
lay
fireless
yet
not
too
cold
since
it
was
wainscoted
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
looked
out
eastwards
upon
the
pleasaunce
with
rooms
on
either
side
of
it
a
couple
of
presses
sunk
in
the
walls
held
his
clothes
and
boots
a
chair
stood
by
the
bed
and
the
bed
itself
laid
immediately
on
the
ground
was
such
as
was
used
in
most
good
houses
by
all
except
the
master
and
mistress
or
any
sick
members
of
the
family
a
straw
mattress
and
a
wooden
pillow
his
bows
and
arrows
with
a
pair
of
dags
or
pistols
hung
on
a
rack
against
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
a
little
brass
cross
engraved
with
a
figure
of
the
crucified
hung
over
it
it
was
such
a
chamber
as
any
son
of
a
house
might
have
who
was
a
gentleman
and
not
luxurious
a
hundred
thoughts
had
gone
through
his
mind
since
he
had
flung
himself
down
here
shaking
with
passion
and
these
had
begun
already
to
repeat
themselves
like
a
turning
wheel
in
his
head
marjorie
his
love
for
her
his
despair
of
that
love
his
father
all
that
they
had
been
one
to
the
other
in
the
past
the
little
or
worse
than
little
that
they
would
be
one
to
the
other
in
the
future
the
priest
face
as
he
had
seen
it
three
days
ago
what
would
be
done
at
easter
what
later
all
these
things
coloured
and
embittered
now
by
his
own
sorrow
for
his
words
to
his
father
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
shamed
himself
when
he
should
have
suffered
in
silence
these
things
turned
continually
in
his
head
and
he
was
too
young
and
too
simple
to
extricate
one
from
the
other
all
at
once
things
had
come
about
in
a
manner
which
yesterday
he
would
not
have
thought
possible
he
had
never
before
spoken
so
to
one
to
whom
he
owed
reverence
neither
had
this
one
ever
treated
him
so
his
father
had
stood
always
to
him
for
uprightness
and
justice
he
had
no
more
questioned
these
virtues
in
his
father
than
in
god
words
or
acts
of
either
might
be
strange
or
incomprehensible
yet
the
virtues
themselves
remained
always
beyond
a
doubt
and
now
with
the
opening
of
the
door
which
his
father
first
decision
had
accomplished
a
crowd
of
questions
and
judgments
had
rushed
in
and
a
pillar
of
earth
and
heaven
was
shaken
at
last
it
is
a
dreadful
day
when
for
the
first
time
to
a
young
man
or
maiden
any
shadow
of
god
however
unworthy
begins
to
tremble
he
understood
presently
however
what
an
elder
man
or
a
less
childish
would
have
understood
at
once
that
these
things
must
be
dealt
with
one
by
one
and
that
that
which
lay
nearest
to
his
hand
was
his
own
fault
even
then
he
fought
with
his
conscience
he
told
himself
that
no
lad
of
spirit
could
tolerate
such
insults
against
his
love
to
say
nothing
of
the
injustice
against
himself
that
had
gone
before
but
being
honest
he
presently
inquired
of
what
spirit
such
a
lad
would
be
not
of
that
spirit
which
marjorie
would
approve
nor
the
priest
he
had
spoken
with
well
the
event
was
certain
with
such
as
robin
and
he
was
presently
standing
at
the
door
of
his
room
his
boots
drawn
off
and
laid
aside
listening
with
a
heart
beating
in
his
ears
to
hinder
him
for
any
sound
from
beneath
he
did
not
know
whether
his
father
were
abed
or
not
if
not
he
must
ask
his
pardon
at
once
he
went
downstairs
at
last
softly
to
the
parlour
and
peeped
in
all
was
dark
except
for
the
glimmer
from
the
stove
and
his
heart
felt
lightened
then
as
he
was
cold
with
his
long
vigil
outside
his
bed
he
stirred
the
embers
into
a
blaze
and
stood
warming
himself
how
strange
and
passionless
he
thought
looked
this
room
after
the
tempest
that
had
raged
in
it
just
now
the
two
glasses
stood
there
his
own
not
quite
empty
and
the
jug
between
them
his
father
chair
was
drawn
to
the
table
as
if
he
were
still
sitting
in
it
his
own
was
flung
back
as
he
had
pushed
it
from
him
in
his
passion
there
was
an
old
print
over
the
stove
at
which
he
looked
presently
it
had
been
his
mother
and
he
remembered
it
as
long
as
his
life
had
been
it
was
of
christ
carrying
his
cross
his
shame
began
to
increase
on
him
how
wickedly
he
had
answered
with
every
word
a
wound
he
knew
that
the
most
poisonous
of
them
all
were
false
he
had
known
it
even
while
he
spoke
them
it
was
not
to
curry
favour
with
her
grace
that
his
father
had
lapsed
it
was
that
his
temper
was
tried
beyond
bearing
by
those
continual
fines
and
rebuffs
the
old
man
patience
was
gone
that
was
all
and
he
his
son
had
not
said
one
word
of
comfort
or
strength
he
had
thought
of
himself
and
his
own
wrongs
and
being
reviled
he
had
reviled
again
there
stood
against
the
wall
between
the
windows
a
table
and
an
oaken
desk
that
held
the
and
books
and
beside
the
desk
were
laid
clean
sheets
of
paper
an
a
and
three
or
four
feather
pens
it
was
here
that
he
wrote
being
newly
from
school
at
his
father
dictation
or
his
father
sometimes
wrote
himself
with
pain
and
labour
the
few
notices
or
letters
that
were
necessary
so
he
went
to
this
and
sat
down
at
it
he
pondered
a
little
then
he
wrote
a
single
line
of
abject
regret
i
ask
your
pardon
and
god
sir
for
the
wicked
words
i
said
before
i
left
the
parlour
he
folded
this
and
addressed
it
with
the
proper
superscription
and
left
it
lying
there
iii
it
was
a
strange
ride
that
he
had
back
from
tansley
next
morning
after
mass
dick
sampson
had
met
him
with
the
horses
in
the
at
matstead
a
little
after
four
in
the
morning
and
together
they
had
ridden
through
the
pitch
darkness
each
carrying
a
lantern
fastened
to
his
stirrup
so
complete
was
the
darkness
however
and
so
small
and
confined
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
tossing
light
that
for
all
they
saw
they
might
have
been
riding
round
and
round
in
a
garden
now
trees
showed
grim
and
towering
for
an
instant
then
gone
again
now
their
eyes
were
upon
the
track
the
pools
the
rugged
ground
the
soaked
half
a
dozen
times
the
river
glimmered
on
their
right
turbid
and
forbidding
once
there
shone
in
the
circle
of
light
the
eyes
of
some
beast
pig
or
stag
seen
and
vanished
again
but
the
return
journey
was
another
matter
for
they
needed
no
lanterns
and
the
dawn
rose
steadily
overhead
showing
all
that
they
passed
in
ghostly
fashion
up
to
final
solidity
it
resembled
in
fact
the
dawn
of
faith
in
a
soul
first
from
the
darkness
outlines
only
emerged
vast
and
sinister
of
such
an
appearance
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
their
proportions
or
distances
the
skyline
a
mile
away
beyond
the
derwent
might
have
been
the
edge
of
a
bank
a
couple
of
yards
off
the
glimmering
pool
on
the
lower
meadow
path
might
be
the
lighted
window
of
a
house
across
the
valley
there
succeeded
to
outlines
a
kind
of
shaded
tint
all
worked
in
gray
like
a
print
clear
enough
to
distinguish
tree
from
boulder
and
sky
from
water
yet
not
clear
enough
to
show
the
texture
of
anything
the
third
stage
was
that
in
which
colours
began
to
appear
yet
flat
and
dismal
holding
it
seemed
no
light
yet
reflecting
it
and
all
in
an
extraordinary
cold
clearness
nature
seemed
herself
yet
struck
to
dumbness
no
breeze
stirred
the
twigs
overhead
or
the
undergrowth
through
which
they
rode
once
as
the
two
riding
a
little
apart
turned
suddenly
together
up
a
ravine
into
thicker
woods
they
came
upon
a
herd
of
deer
who
stared
on
them
without
any
movement
that
the
eye
could
see
here
a
stag
stood
with
two
hinds
beside
him
behind
robin
saw
the
backs
and
heads
of
others
that
lay
still
only
the
beasts
kept
their
eyes
upon
them
as
they
went
watching
as
if
it
were
a
picture
only
that
went
by
so
by
little
and
little
the
breeze
stirred
like
a
waking
man
cocks
crew
from
over
the
hills
one
to
the
other
dogs
barked
far
away
till
the
face
of
the
world
was
itself
again
and
the
smoke
from
matstead
rose
above
the
trees
in
front
robin
had
ridden
in
the
dawn
an
hundred
times
before
yet
never
before
had
he
so
perceived
that
strange
deliberateness
and
sleep
of
the
world
and
he
had
ridden
too
perhaps
twenty
times
at
such
an
hour
with
his
father
beside
him
after
mass
on
some
such
occasion
yet
it
seemed
to
him
this
time
that
it
was
the
mass
which
he
had
seen
and
his
own
solitariness
that
had
illuminated
his
eyes
it
was
dreadful
to
him
and
yet
it
threw
him
more
than
ever
on
himself
and
god
that
his
father
would
ride
with
him
so
no
more
henceforward
he
would
go
alone
or
with
a
servant
only
he
would
alone
go
up
to
the
door
of
house
or
barn
and
rap
four
times
with
his
alone
he
would
pass
upstairs
through
the
darkened
house
to
the
shrouded
room
garret
or
where
the
group
was
assembled
all
in
silence
where
presently
a
dark
figure
would
rise
and
light
the
pair
of
candles
and
then
himself
a
ghost
vest
there
by
their
light
throwing
huge
shadows
on
wainscot
and
ceiling
as
his
arms
went
this
way
and
that
and
then
alone
of
all
that
were
of
to
him
he
would
witness
the
holy
sacrifice
how
long
that
would
be
so
he
did
not
know
something
surely
must
happen
that
would
prevent
it
or
at
least
some
day
he
would
ride
so
with
marjorie
whom
he
had
seen
this
morning
across
the
dusky
gloom
praying
in
a
corner
or
maybe
with
her
would
entertain
the
priest
and
open
the
door
to
the
worshippers
who
streamed
in
like
bees
to
a
from
farm
and
manor
and
village
he
could
not
for
ever
ride
alone
from
matstead
and
meet
his
father
silence
one
thing
more
too
had
moved
him
this
morning
and
that
the
sight
of
the
young
priest
at
the
altar
whom
he
had
met
on
the
moor
here
more
than
ever
was
the
gentle
priestliness
and
innocency
apparent
he
stood
there
in
his
red
vestments
he
moved
this
way
and
that
he
made
his
gestures
he
spoke
in
undertones
lit
only
by
the
pair
of
more
levitical
than
ever
in
such
a
guise
yet
more
unsuited
than
ever
to
such
exterior
circumstances
surely
this
man
should
say
mass
for
ever
yet
surely
never
again
ride
over
the
moors
to
do
it
amidst
enemies
he
was
of
the
strong
castle
and
the
chamber
not
of
the
tent
and
the
battle
and
yet
it
was
of
such
soldiers
as
these
as
well
as
of
the
sturdy
and
the
strong
that
christ
army
was
made
it
was
in
broad
daylight
though
under
a
weeping
sky
that
robin
rode
into
the
court
at
matstead
he
shook
the
rain
from
his
cloak
within
the
screens
and
stamped
to
get
the
mud
away
and
as
he
lifted
his
hat
to
shake
it
his
father
came
in
from
the
pleasaunce
robin
glanced
up
at
him
swift
and
shy
half
smiling
expecting
a
word
or
a
look
his
father
must
surely
have
read
his
little
letter
by
now
and
forgiven
him
but
the
smile
died
away
again
as
he
met
the
old
eyes
they
were
as
hard
as
steel
his
lips
were
set
like
a
trap
and
though
he
looked
at
his
son
it
seemed
that
he
did
not
see
him
he
passed
through
the
screens
and
went
down
the
steps
into
the
court
the
boy
heart
began
to
beat
so
as
near
to
sicken
him
after
his
long
fast
and
his
ride
he
told
himself
that
his
father
could
not
have
been
into
the
parlour
yet
though
he
knew
even
while
he
thought
it
that
this
was
false
comfort
he
stood
there
an
instant
waiting
hoping
that
even
now
his
father
would
call
to
him
but
the
strong
figure
passed
resolutely
on
out
of
sight
then
the
boy
went
into
the
hall
and
swiftly
through
it
there
on
the
desk
in
the
window
lay
the
pen
he
had
flung
down
last
night
but
no
more
the
letter
was
gone
and
as
he
turned
away
he
saw
lying
among
the
of
the
cold
stove
a
little
crumpled
ball
he
stooped
and
drew
it
out
it
was
his
letter
tossed
there
after
the
reading
his
father
had
not
taken
the
pains
to
keep
it
safe
nor
even
to
destroy
it
chapter
iv
i
the
company
was
already
assembled
both
within
and
without
padley
when
robin
rode
up
from
the
riverside
on
a
fine
windy
morning
for
the
sport
of
the
day
perhaps
a
dozen
horses
stood
tethered
at
the
entrance
to
the
little
court
with
a
man
or
two
to
look
after
them
for
the
greater
part
of
their
riders
were
already
within
and
a
continual
coming
and
going
of
lads
with
dogs
falconers
each
with
his
cadge
or
frame
on
which
sat
the
hawks
a
barking
of
hounds
a
screaming
of
birds
a
clatter
of
voices
and
footsteps
in
the
court
all
this
showed
that
the
boy
was
none
too
early
a
man
stepped
forward
to
take
his
mare
and
his
hawks
and
robin
slipped
from
his
saddle
and
went
in
padley
hall
was
just
such
a
house
as
would
serve
a
wealthy
gentleman
who
desired
a
small
country
estate
with
sufficient
dignity
and
not
too
many
responsibilities
it
stood
upon
the
side
of
the
hill
well
above
the
damps
of
the
valley
yet
protected
from
the
winds
by
the
higher
slopes
on
the
tops
of
which
lay
burbage
moor
where
the
hawking
was
to
be
held
on
the
south
over
the
valley
stood
out
the
modest
hall
and
buttery
as
indeed
they
stand
to
this
day
with
a
door
between
them
well
buttressed
in
two
places
upon
the
falling
ground
in
one
by
a
chimney
in
the
other
by
a
slope
of
masonry
and
behind
these
buildings
stood
the
rest
of
the
court
the
stables
the
the
and
such
like
below
and
above
the
sleeping
rooms
for
the
family
and
the
servants
on
the
first
floor
above
the
buttery
and
the
hall
were
situated
the
ladies
parlour
and
chapel
for
this
at
least
padley
had
however
little
its
dignity
in
other
matters
that
it
retained
its
chapel
served
in
these
sorrowful
days
not
as
once
by
a
chaplain
but
by
whatever
travelling
priest
might
be
there
robin
entered
through
the
great
gate
on
the
east
side
a
dark
entrance
kept
by
a
porter
who
saluted
him
and
rode
through
into
the
court
and
here
indeed
was
the
company
for
out
of
the
windows
of
the
low
hall
on
his
left
came
a
babble
of
tongues
while
two
or
three
gentlemen
with
pots
in
their
hands
saluted
him
from
the
passage
door
telling
him
that
thomas
fitzherbert
was
within
fenton
was
one
of
these
come
over
from
north
lees
where
he
had
his
manor
a
brisk
man
dressed
soberly
and
well
with
a
pointed
beard
and
pleasant
dancing
eyes
and
john
too
came
last
night
he
said
but
he
will
not
hawk
with
us
he
is
ridden
from
london
on
private
matters
it
was
an
exceedingly
gay
sight
on
which
robin
looked
as
he
turned
into
the
hall
it
was
a
low
room
ceiled
in
oak
and
wainscoted
up
a
trifle
dark
since
it
was
lighted
only
by
one
or
two
little
windows
on
either
side
yet
warm
and
hospitable
looking
with
a
great
fire
burning
in
a
chimney
on
the
south
side
and
perhaps
a
dozen
and
a
half
persons
sitting
over
their
food
and
drink
since
they
were
dining
early
to
have
the
longer
time
for
sport
a
voice
hailed
him
as
he
came
in
and
he
went
up
to
pay
his
respects
to
john
fitzherbert
a
tall
man
well
past
who
sat
with
his
hat
on
his
head
at
the
centre
of
the
high
table
with
the
arms
of
eyre
and
fitzherbert
beneath
the
canopy
all
emblazoned
to
do
the
honours
of
the
day
you
are
late
sir
you
are
late
he
cried
out
genially
we
are
just
done
robin
saluted
him
he
liked
this
man
though
he
did
not
know
him
very
well
for
he
was
continually
about
the
country
now
in
london
now
at
norbury
now
at
swinnerton
always
occupied
with
these
endless
matters
of
fines
and
recusancy
robin
saluted
him
then
and
said
a
word
or
two
bowed
to
thomas
his
son
who
came
up
to
speak
with
him
and
then
looked
for
marjorie
she
sat
there
at
the
corner
of
the
table
with
fenton
at
one
side
and
an
empty
seat
on
the
other
robin
immediately
sat
down
in
it
to
eat
his
dinner
beginning
with
the
gross
foods
according
to
the
english
custom
there
was
a
piece
of
christmas
brawn
from
a
pig
fattened
on
oats
and
peas
and
hardened
by
being
lodged
while
he
lived
on
a
boarded
floor
all
this
was
told
robin
across
the
table
with
particularity
while
he
ate
it
and
drank
according
to
etiquette
a
cup
of
bastard
he
attended
to
all
this
zealously
while
never
for
an
instant
was
he
unaware
of
the
girl
they
tricked
their
elders
very
well
these
two
innocent
ones
you
would
have
sworn
that
robin
looked
for
another
place
and
could
not
see
one
you
would
have
sworn
that
they
were
shy
of
one
another
and
spoke
scarcely
a
dozen
sentences
yet
they
did
very
well
each
in
the
company
of
the
other
and
robin
indeed
before
he
had
finished
his
partridge
had
conveyed
to
her
that
there
was
news
that
he
had
and
must
give
to
her
before
the
day
was
out
she
looked
at
him
with
enough
dismay
in
her
face
for
him
at
least
to
read
it
for
she
knew
by
his
manner
that
it
would
not
be
happy
news
so
too
when
the
fruit
was
done
and
dinner
was
over
for
they
had
no
opportunity
to
speak
at
any
length
again
you
would
have
sworn
that
the
last
idea
in
his
mind
as
in
hers
was
that
he
should
be
the
one
to
help
her
to
her
saddle
yet
he
did
so
and
he
fetched
her
hawk
for
her
and
settled
her
reins
in
her
hand
and
presently
he
on
one
side
of
her
with
fenton
on
the
other
side
were
riding
up
through
padley
chase
and
the
talk
and
the
laughter
went
up
too
ii
up
on
the
high
moors
in
the
here
indeed
was
a
day
to
make
sad
hearts
rejoice
the
air
was
soft
as
if
spring
were
come
before
his
time
and
in
the
great
wind
that
blew
continually
from
the
bearing
the
high
clouds
swiftly
against
the
blue
ruffling
the
stiff
and
bilberry
beneath
here
was
wine
enough
for
any
mourners
before
them
as
they
went
two
riding
before
with
falconers
on
either
side
a
little
behind
and
the
lads
with
the
dogs
beside
them
and
the
rest
in
a
silent
line
some
twenty
yards
to
the
rear
stretched
the
wide
flat
moor
like
a
tumbled
broken
here
and
there
by
groups
of
beech
and
oak
backed
by
the
tall
limestone
crags
like
of
an
upper
world
with
here
and
there
a
little
shallow
quarry
whence
marble
had
been
taken
for
derby
but
more
lovely
than
all
were
the
valleys
seen
from
here
as
great
troughs
up
whose
sides
trooped
the
leafless
trees
lit
by
the
streams
that
threw
back
the
sunlit
sky
from
their
bosoms
with
here
a
mist
of
smoke
blown
all
about
from
a
village
out
of
sight
here
the
shadow
of
a
travelling
cloud
that
fled
as
swift
as
the
wind
that
drove
it
extinguishing
the
flash
of
water
only
to
release
it
again
darkening
a
sweep
of
land
only
to
make
the
sunlight
that
followed
it
the
more
sweet
yet
the
two
saw
little
of
this
dear
and
familiar
as
they
found
it
since
first
they
rode
together
and
next
as
it
should
be
with
young
hearts
the
sport
presently
began
and
drove
all
else
away
the
sport
was
done
in
this
way
the
two
that
rode
in
front
selected
each
from
the
cadge
one
of
his
own
falcons
it
was
peregrines
that
were
used
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
since
they
were
first
after
partridges
and
so
rode
carrying
his
falcon
on
his
wrist
hooded
belled
and
in
the
leash
ready
to
cast
off
immediately
before
them
went
a
lad
with
a
couple
of
dogs
to
nose
the
game
these
also
in
a
leash
until
they
stiffened
then
the
lad
released
them
and
stepped
softly
back
while
the
riders
moved
on
at
a
and
the
spaniels
behind
rose
on
their
hind
legs
choked
by
the
chain
whimpering
fifty
yards
in
the
rear
slowly
the
dogs
advanced
each
a
frozen
model
of
craft
and
till
an
instant
afterwards
with
a
whir
and
a
chattering
like
a
broken
clock
the
covey
whirled
from
the
thick
growth
underfoot
and
flashed
away
northwards
and
a
moment
later
up
went
the
peregrines
behind
them
then
indeed
it
was
qui
for
the
ground
was
full
of
holes
here
and
there
though
there
were
as
well
on
which
all
rode
with
loose
rein
the
two
whose
falcons
were
sprung
always
in
front
according
to
custom
and
the
rest
in
a
medley
behind
away
then
went
the
birds
pursued
and
pursuers
till
like
a
falling
star
the
falcon
stooped
and
then
maybe
the
other
a
moment
later
down
upon
the
quarry
and
a
minute
later
there
was
the
falcon
back
again
shivering
with
pride
and
ecstasy
or
all
with
shame
back
on
his
master
wrist
and
another
torn
partridge
or
maybe
two
in
the
bottom
of
the
bag
and
arguments
went
full
pelt
and
cries
and
sometimes
sharp
words
and
faults
were
found
and
praise
was
given
and
so
on
for
another
pair
it
was
but
natural
that
robin
and
marjorie
should
compete
one
against
the
other
for
they
were
riding
together
and
talked
together
so
presently
thomas
called
to
them
and
beckoned
them
to
their
places
robin
set
aside
agnes
on
to
the
cadge
and
chose
magdalen
and
marjorie
chose
sharpie
the
array
was
set
and
all
moved
forward
it
was
a
short
chase
and
a
merry
one
two
birds
rose
from
the
heather
and
flew
screaming
skimming
low
as
from
behind
them
moved
on
the
shadows
of
death
still
as
clouds
with
great
noiseless
sweeps
of
wings
behind
came
the
gallopers
marjorie
on
her
black
horse
robin
on
cecily
seeming
to
compete
yet
each
content
if
either
won
each
maybe
or
at
least
marjorie
desiring
that
the
other
should
win
and
the
wind
screamed
past
them
as
they
went
then
came
the
stoops
together
as
if
fastened
by
one
string
faultless
and
exquisite
and
as
the
two
rode
up
and
drew
rein
there
side
by
side
on
the
windy
turf
two
fierce
statues
of
destiny
on
the
beaks
resolute
and
suspicious
eyed
them
motionless
the
claws
sunk
deeply
through
back
and
head
awaiting
recapture
marjorie
turned
swiftly
to
the
boy
as
he
leaped
off
in
the
chapel
she
said
at
padley
robin
stared
at
her
then
he
understood
and
nodded
his
head
as
thomas
rode
up
his
beard
all
blown
about
by
the
wind
breathless
but
congratulatory
iii
it
fell
on
robin
mind
with
a
certain
heaviness
and
reproach
that
it
should
have
been
she
who
should
have
carried
in
her
head
all
day
the
unknown
news
that
he
was
to
give
her
and
he
who
should
have
forgotten
it
he
understood
then
a
little
better
of
all
that
he
must
be
to
her
since
as
he
turned
to
her
his
head
full
of
hawks
and
the
glory
of
the
shouting
wind
and
every
thought
of
faith
and
father
clean
blown
away
it
was
to
her
mind
that
the
had
leapt
that
here
was
their
first
and
perhaps
their
last
chance
of
speaking
in
private
it
was
indeed
their
last
chance
for
the
sun
already
stood
over
far
away
to
the
and
they
must
begin
their
circle
to
return
in
which
the
ladies
should
fly
their
merlins
after
larks
and
there
was
no
hope
henceforth
for
robin
henceforth
she
rode
with
fenton
and
two
or
three
more
while
the
gentlemen
who
loved
sport
more
than
courtesy
turned
to
the
left
over
the
broken
ground
to
work
back
once
more
after
partridges
and
robin
dared
no
more
ride
with
his
love
for
fear
that
his
company
all
day
with
her
should
be
marked
it
was
within
an
hour
of
sunset
that
robin
riding
ahead
having
lost
a
hawk
and
his
hat
having
fallen
into
a
being
one
mask
of
mud
from
head
to
foot
slid
from
his
horse
into
dick
hands
and
demanded
if
the
ladies
were
back
yes
sir
they
are
back
half
an
hour
ago
they
are
in
the
parlour
robin
knew
better
i
shall
be
riding
in
ten
minutes
he
said
give
the
mare
a
mouthful
he
limped
across
the
court
and
looking
behind
him
to
see
if
any
saw
and
finding
the
court
at
that
instant
empty
ran
up
as
well
as
he
could
the
stone
staircase
that
rose
from
the
outside
to
the
chapel
door
it
was
unlatched
he
pushed
it
open
and
went
in
it
was
a
brave
thing
that
the
fitzherberts
did
in
keeping
such
a
place
at
all
since
the
greatest
protestant
fool
in
the
valley
knew
what
the
little
chamber
was
that
had
the
angels
carved
on
the
and
the
piscina
in
the
south
wall
windows
looked
out
every
way
through
those
on
the
south
could
be
seen
now
the
darkening
valley
and
the
sunlit
hills
and
yet
more
necessary
the
road
by
which
any
travellers
from
the
valley
must
surely
come
within
too
scarcely
any
pains
were
taken
to
disguise
the
place
it
was
wainscoted
from
roof
to
floor
veiled
floored
and
walled
in
oak
a
great
chest
stood
beneath
the
little
east
window
of
two
lights
that
cried
altar
if
any
chest
ever
did
so
a
great
press
stood
against
the
wooden
screen
that
shut
the
room
from
the
ladies
parlour
next
door
filled
in
three
shelves
with
innocent
linen
for
this
was
the
only
disguise
that
the
place
stooped
to
put
on
you
could
not
swear
that
mass
was
said
there
but
you
could
swear
that
it
was
a
place
in
which
mass
would
very
suitably
be
said
a
couple
of
benches
were
against
the
press
and
three
or
four
chairs
stood
about
the
floor
robin
saw
her
against
the
light
as
soon
as
he
came
in
she
was
still
in
her
blue
with
the
hood
on
her
shoulders
and
held
her
whip
in
her
hand
but
he
could
see
no
more
of
her
head
than
the
paleness
of
her
face
and
the
gleam
on
her
black
hair
well
then
she
whispered
sharply
and
then
why
what
a
state
you
are
in
it
nothing
said
robin
i
rolled
in
a
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
you
are
not
hurt
sit
down
at
least
he
sat
down
stiffly
and
she
beside
him
still
watching
to
see
if
he
were
the
worse
for
his
falling
he
took
her
hand
in
his
i
am
not
fit
to
touch
you
he
said
tell
me
the
news
tell
me
quickly
so
he
told
her
of
the
wrangle
in
the
parlour
and
what
had
passed
between
his
father
and
him
of
his
own
bitterness
and
his
letter
and
the
way
in
which
the
old
man
had
taken
it
he
has
not
spoken
to
me
since
he
said
except
in
public
before
the
servants
both
nights
after
supper
he
has
sat
silent
and
i
beside
him
and
you
have
not
spoken
to
him
she
asked
quickly
i
said
something
to
him
after
supper
on
sunday
and
he
made
no
answer
he
has
done
all
his
writing
himself
i
think
it
is
for
him
to
speak
now
i
should
only
anger
him
more
if
i
tried
it
again
she
sighed
suddenly
and
swiftly
but
said
nothing
her
hand
lay
passive
in
his
but
her
face
was
turned
now
to
the
bright
southerly
window
and
he
could
see
her
puzzled
eyes
and
her
serious
mouth
she
was
thinking
with
all
her
wits
and
plainly
could
come
to
no
conclusion
she
turned
to
him
again
and
you
told
him
plainly
that
you
and
i
that
you
and
i
that
you
and
i
loved
one
another
i
told
him
plainly
and
it
was
his
contempt
that
angered
me
she
sighed
again
it
was
a
troublesome
situation
in
which
these
two
children
found
themselves
here
was
the
father
of
one
of
them
that
knew
yet
not
the
parents
of
the
other
who
should
know
first
of
all
neither
was
there
any
promise
of
secrecy
and
no
hope
of
obtaining
it
if
she
should
not
tell
her
parents
then
if
the
old
man
told
them
deception
would
be
charged
against
her
and
if
she
should
tell
them
perhaps
he
would
not
have
done
so
and
so
all
be
brought
to
light
too
soon
and
without
cause
and
besides
all
this
there
were
the
other
matters
heavy
enough
before
yet
far
more
heavy
now
matters
of
their
hopes
for
the
future
the
complications
with
regard
to
the
religion
what
robin
should
do
what
he
should
not
do
so
they
sat
there
silent
she
thinking
and
he
waiting
upon
her
thought
she
sighed
again
and
turned
to
him
her
troubled
eyes
my
robin
she
said
i
have
been
thinking
so
much
about
you
and
i
have
feared
sometimes
she
stopped
herself
and
he
looked
for
her
to
finish
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
stood
up
oh
it
is
miserable
she
cried
and
all
might
have
been
so
happy
the
tears
suddenly
filled
her
eyes
so
that
they
shone
like
flowers
in
dew
he
stood
up
too
and
put
his
muddy
arm
about
her
shoulders
she
felt
so
slight
and
slender
it
will
be
happy
he
said
what
have
you
been
fearing
she
shook
her
head
and
the
tears
ran
down
i
can
not
tell
you
yet
robin
what
a
holy
man
that
travelling
priest
must
be
who
said
mass
on
sunday
the
lad
was
bewildered
at
her
swift
changes
of
thought
for
he
did
not
yet
see
the
chain
on
which
they
hung
he
strove
to
follow
her
it
seemed
so
to
me
too
he
said
i
think
i
have
never
seen
it
seemed
so
to
you
too
she
cried
why
what
do
you
know
of
him
he
was
amazed
at
her
vehemence
she
had
drawn
herself
clear
of
his
arm
and
was
looking
at
him
full
in
the
face
i
met
him
on
the
moor
he
said
i
had
some
talk
with
him
i
got
his
blessing
you
got
his
blessing
why
so
did
i
after
the
mass
when
you
were
gone
then
that
should
join
us
more
closely
than
ever
he
said
in
heaven
perhaps
but
on
earth
she
checked
herself
again
tell
me
what
you
thought
of
him
robin
i
thought
it
was
strange
that
such
a
man
as
that
should
live
such
a
rough
life
if
he
were
in
the
seminary
now
safe
at
douay
she
seemed
a
shade
paler
but
her
eyes
did
not
flicker
yes
she
said
and
you
thought
i
thought
that
it
was
not
that
kind
of
man
who
should
fare
so
hardly
if
it
were
a
man
like
john
merton
who
is
accustomed
to
such
things
or
a
man
like
me
again
he
stopped
he
did
not
know
why
but
it
was
as
if
she
had
cried
out
though
she
neither
spoke
nor
moved
you
thought
that
did
you
robin
she
said
presently
never
moving
her
eyes
from
his
face
i
thought
so
too
but
i
do
not
know
why
we
are
talking
about
simpson
said
the
lad
there
are
other
affairs
more
pressing
i
am
not
sure
said
she
marjorie
my
love
what
are
you
thinking
about
she
had
turned
her
eyes
and
was
looking
out
through
the
little
window
outside
the
red
sunlight
still
lay
on
the
crags
and
slopes
beyond
the
deep
valley
beneath
them
and
her
face
was
bright
in
the
reflected
brightness
yet
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
serious
she
turned
her
eyes
back
to
him
as
he
spoke
i
am
thinking
of
a
great
many
things
she
said
i
am
thinking
of
the
faith
and
of
sorrow
and
of
love
my
love
what
do
you
mean
suddenly
she
made
a
swift
movement
towards
him
and
took
him
by
the
lapels
he
could
see
her
face
close
beneath
his
yet
it
was
in
shadow
again
and
he
could
make
out
of
it
no
more
than
the
shadows
of
mouth
and
eyes
robin
she
said
i
can
not
tell
you
unless
god
tells
you
himself
i
am
told
that
i
am
too
scrupulous
sometimes
i
do
not
know
what
i
think
nor
what
is
right
nor
what
are
fancies
but
but
i
know
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
and
that
i
can
not
bear
then
her
face
was
on
his
breast
in
a
passion
of
weeping
and
his
arms
were
round
her
and
his
lips
on
her
hair
iv
dick
found
his
master
a
poor
travelling
companion
as
they
rode
home
he
made
a
few
respectful
remarks
as
to
the
sport
of
the
day
but
he
was
answered
by
a
wandering
eye
and
a
complete
lack
of
enthusiasm
robin
rode
loosely
and
heavily
three
or
four
times
his
mare
stumbled
and
no
wonder
after
all
that
she
had
gone
through
and
he
jerked
her
savagely
then
dick
tried
another
tack
and
began
to
speak
of
the
company
but
with
no
greater
success
he
discoursed
on
the
riding
of
fenton
and
the
peregrine
of
thomas
who
had
distinguished
herself
that
day
and
he
was
met
by
a
eye
once
more
finally
he
began
to
speak
of
the
religious
gossip
of
the
countryside
how
it
was
said
that
another
priest
a
nelson
had
been
taken
in
london
as
maine
had
been
in
cornwall
that
it
was
said
again
priests
would
have
to
look
to
their
lives
in
future
and
not
only
to
their
liberty
how
the
priest
simpson
was
said
to
be
a
native
of
yorkshire
and
how
he
was
ridden
northwards
again
still
with
ludlam
and
here
he
met
with
a
little
more
encouragement
robin
asked
where
was
simpson
gone
to
and
dick
told
him
he
did
not
know
but
that
he
would
be
back
again
by
easter
it
was
thought
or
if
not
another
priest
would
be
in
the
district
then
he
began
to
gossip
of
ludlam
how
a
man
had
told
him
that
his
cousin
wife
thought
that
ludlam
was
to
go
abroad
to
be
made
priest
himself
and
that
perhaps
garlick
would
go
too
that
is
the
kind
of
priest
we
want
sir
said
dick
eh
that
is
the
kind
of
priest
we
want
sir
repeated
dick
solemnly
we
should
do
better
with
natives
than
foreigners
we
want
priests
who
know
the
county
and
the
ways
of
the
people
and
men
too
i
think
sir
who
can
ride
and
know
something
of
sport
and
can
talk
of
it
i
told
simpson
sir
of
the
sport
we
were
to
have
and
he
seemed
to
care
nothing
about
it
robin
sighed
aloud
i
suppose
so
he
said
john
looked
well
sir
pursued
dick
and
proceeded
to
speak
at
length
of
the
fitzherbert
troubles
and
the
iniquities
of
the
grace
he
was
such
a
man
as
was
to
be
found
throughout
all
england
everywhere
at
this
time
a
man
whose
religion
was
a
part
of
his
politics
and
none
the
less
genuine
for
that
he
was
a
shrewd
man
in
his
way
with
the
simplicity
which
belongs
to
such
shrewdness
he
disliked
the
new
ways
which
he
experienced
chiefly
in
the
towns
and
put
them
down
not
wholly
without
justice
to
the
change
of
which
religion
formed
an
integral
part
he
hated
the
beggars
and
would
gladly
have
gone
to
see
one
flogged
and
he
disliked
the
ministers
and
their
sermons
and
their
prophesyings
with
all
the
healthy
ardour
of
prejudice
once
in
the
year
did
dick
approach
the
sacraments
and
a
great
business
he
made
of
it
being
unusually
morose
before
them
and
almost
indecently
boisterous
after
them
he
was
feudal
to
the
very
heart
of
him
and
it
was
his
feudality
that
made
him
faithful
to
his
religion
as
well
as
to
his
masters
for
either
of
which
he
would
resolutely
have
died
and
what
in
the
world
he
would
do
when
he
discovered
at
easter
that
the
objects
of
his
fidelity
were
to
take
opposite
courses
robin
could
not
conceive
as
they
rode
in
at
last
robin
who
had
fallen
silent
again
after
last
piece
of
respectful
vehemence
suddenly
beat
his
own
leg
with
his
whip
and
uttered
an
inaudible
word
it
seemed
to
dick
that
the
young
master
had
perceived
clearly
that
which
plainly
had
been
worrying
him
all
the
way
home
and
that
he
did
not
like
it
chapter
v
i
mr
manners
sat
in
his
parlour
ten
days
after
the
beginning
of
lent
full
of
his
sunday
dinner
and
of
perplexing
thoughts
all
at
once
he
had
eaten
well
and
heartily
after
his
week
of
spare
diet
and
then
while
in
high
humour
with
all
the
world
first
his
wife
and
then
his
daughter
had
laid
before
him
such
revelations
that
all
the
pleasure
of
digestion
was
gone
it
was
but
three
minutes
ago
that
marjorie
had
fled
from
him
in
a
torrent
of
tears
for
which
he
could
not
see
himself
responsible
since
he
had
done
nothing
but
make
the
exclamations
and
comments
that
should
be
expected
of
a
father
in
such
a
case
the
following
were
the
points
for
his
reflection
to
begin
with
those
that
touched
him
less
closely
first
that
his
friend
audrey
whom
he
had
always
looked
upon
with
reverence
and
a
kind
of
terror
because
of
his
hotness
in
matters
of
politics
and
religion
had
capitulated
to
the
enemy
and
was
to
go
to
church
at
easter
mr
manners
himself
had
something
of
timidity
in
his
nature
he
was
conservative
certainly
and
practised
when
he
could
without
bringing
himself
into
open
trouble
the
old
religion
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
he
like
the
younger
generation
had
been
educated
at
derby
grammar
school
and
in
his
youth
had
sat
with
his
parents
in
the
nave
of
the
old
cluniac
church
of
james
to
hear
mass
he
had
then
entered
his
father
office
in
derby
about
the
time
that
the
religious
houses
had
fallen
and
had
transferred
the
scene
of
his
worship
to
peter
at
queen
mary
accession
he
had
stood
with
mild
but
genuine
enthusiasm
in
his
lawyer
gown
in
the
train
of
the
sheriff
who
proclaimed
her
in
derby
and
stood
in
the
crowd
with
corresponding
dismay
six
years
later
to
shout
for
queen
elizabeth
since
that
date
for
the
first
eleven
years
he
had
gone
as
did
other
catholics
to
his
parish
church
secretly
thankful
that
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
priesthood
of
his
parson
to
hear
the
english
prayers
and
then
to
do
him
justice
though
he
heard
with
something
resembling
consternation
the
decision
from
rome
that
compromise
must
cease
and
that
henceforth
all
true
catholics
must
withdraw
themselves
from
the
national
worship
he
had
obeyed
without
even
a
serious
moment
of
consideration
he
had
always
feared
that
it
might
be
so
understanding
that
delay
in
the
decision
was
only
caused
by
the
hope
that
even
now
the
breach
might
not
be
final
or
complete
and
so
was
better
prepared
for
the
blow
when
it
came
since
that
time
he
had
heard
mass
when
he
could
and
occasionally
even
harboured
priests
urged
thereto
by
his
wife
and
daughter
and
for
the
rest
still
went
into
derby
for
three
or
four
days
a
week
to
carry
on
his
lawyer
business
with
biddell
his
partner
and
had
the
reputation
of
a
sound
and
careful
man
without
bigotry
or
passion
it
was
then
a
shock
to
his
love
of
peace
and
serenity
to
hear
that
yet
another
catholic
house
had
fallen
and
that
audrey
one
of
his
clients
could
no
longer
be
reckoned
as
one
of
his
the
next
point
for
his
reflection
was
that
robin
was
refusing
to
follow
his
father
example
the
third
that
somebody
must
harbour
the
boy
over
easter
and
that
in
his
daughter
violently
expressed
opinion
and
with
his
wife
consent
he
thomas
manners
was
the
proper
person
to
do
it
last
that
it
was
plain
that
there
was
something
between
his
daughter
and
this
boy
though
what
that
was
he
had
been
unable
to
understand
marjorie
had
flown
suddenly
from
the
room
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
put
his
questions
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
his
peace
of
mind
was
gone
not
only
were
large
principles
once
more
threatened
considerations
of
religion
and
loyalty
but
also
those
small
and
intimate
principles
which
so
far
more
than
great
ones
agitate
the
mind
of
the
individual
he
did
not
wish
to
lose
a
client
yet
neither
did
he
wish
to
be
unfriendly
to
a
young
confessor
for
the
faith
still
less
did
he
wish
to
lose
his
daughter
above
all
to
a
young
man
whose
prospects
seemed
to
be
vanishing
he
wondered
whether
it
would
be
prudent
to
consult
biddell
on
the
point
he
was
a
small
and
precise
man
in
his
body
and
face
as
well
as
in
his
dress
his
costume
was
of
course
of
black
but
he
went
so
far
as
to
wear
black
buckles
too
on
his
shoes
and
a
black
hilt
on
his
sword
his
face
was
little
and
anxious
his
eyebrows
were
perpetually
arched
as
if
in
appeal
and
he
was
accustomed
when
in
deep
thought
to
move
his
lips
as
if
in
a
motion
of
tasting
so
then
he
sat
before
his
fire
after
dinner
his
elbow
on
the
table
where
his
few
books
lay
his
feet
crossed
before
him
his
cup
of
drink
untouched
at
his
side
and
meantime
he
tasted
continually
with
his
lips
as
if
better
to
appreciate
the
values
and
significances
of
the
points
for
his
consideration
it
would
be
about
half
an
hour
later
that
the
door
opened
once
more
and
marjorie
came
in
again
she
was
in
her
fine
dress
fine
that
is
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
time
and
place
though
sober
enough
if
for
a
in
a
good
blue
silk
rather
dark
with
a
little
ruff
with
lace
ruffles
at
her
wrists
and
a
quilted
petticoat
and
silver
buckles
for
she
was
a
gentleman
daughter
quite
clearly
and
not
a
yeoman
and
she
must
dress
to
her
station
her
face
was
very
pale
and
quite
steady
she
stood
opposite
her
father
father
she
said
i
am
very
sorry
for
having
behaved
like
a
goose
you
were
quite
right
to
ask
those
questions
and
i
have
come
back
to
answer
them
he
had
ceased
tasting
as
she
came
in
he
looked
at
her
timidly
and
yet
with
an
attempt
at
severity
he
knew
what
was
due
from
him
as
a
father
but
for
the
present
he
had
forgotten
what
questions
they
were
his
mind
had
been
circling
so
wildly
you
are
right
to
come
back
he
said
you
should
not
have
left
me
so
i
am
very
sorry
she
said
again
well
then
you
tell
me
that
robin
has
nowhere
else
to
go
she
flushed
a
little
he
has
ten
places
to
go
to
he
has
plenty
of
friends
but
none
have
the
right
that
we
have
he
is
a
neighbour
it
was
to
me
first
of
all
that
he
told
the
trouble
then
he
remembered
sit
down
he
said
i
must
understand
much
better
first
i
do
not
understand
why
he
came
to
you
first
why
not
if
he
must
come
to
this
house
at
all
why
not
to
me
i
like
the
lad
he
knows
that
well
enough
he
spoke
with
an
admirable
dignity
and
began
to
feel
more
happy
in
consequence
she
had
sat
down
as
he
told
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
but
he
could
not
see
her
face
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
perhaps
she
said
but
yes
what
is
that
then
she
faced
him
and
her
eyes
were
swimming
father
he
told
me
first
because
he
loves
me
and
because
i
love
him
he
sat
up
this
was
speaking
outright
what
she
had
only
hinted
at
before
she
must
have
been
gathering
her
resolution
to
say
this
while
she
had
been
gone
perhaps
she
had
been
with
her
mother
in
that
case
he
must
be
cautious
you
mean
i
mean
just
what
i
say
we
love
one
another
and
i
am
willing
to
be
his
wife
if
he
desires
it
and
with
your
permission
but
he
waited
for
her
to
go
on
another
he
said
presently
though
with
increasing
mildness
i
do
not
think
he
will
desire
it
after
a
while
and
and
i
do
not
know
what
i
wish
i
am
torn
in
two
but
you
are
willing
i
pray
for
it
every
night
she
cried
piteously
and
every
morning
i
pray
that
it
may
not
be
so
she
was
staring
at
him
as
if
in
agony
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
looked
for
in
her
he
was
completely
bewildered
i
do
not
understand
one
word
then
she
threw
herself
at
his
knees
and
seized
his
hands
her
face
was
all
torn
with
pain
and
i
can
not
explain
one
word
father
i
am
in
misery
you
must
pray
for
me
and
have
patience
with
me
i
must
wait
i
must
wait
and
see
what
god
wishes
now
now
father
you
will
trust
me
will
you
not
listen
to
me
you
must
tell
me
thus
do
you
love
this
boy
yes
yes
and
you
have
told
him
so
he
asked
you
i
mean
yes
he
put
her
hands
firmly
from
his
knee
then
you
must
marry
him
if
matters
can
be
arranged
it
is
what
i
should
wish
but
i
do
not
know
father
you
do
not
understand
you
do
not
understand
i
tell
you
i
am
willing
enough
if
he
wishes
it
if
he
wishes
it
again
she
seized
his
hands
and
held
them
and
again
bewilderment
came
down
on
him
like
a
cloud
father
you
must
trust
me
i
am
willing
to
do
everything
that
i
ought
she
was
speaking
firmly
and
confidently
now
if
he
wishes
to
marry
me
i
will
marry
him
i
love
him
dearly
but
you
must
say
nothing
to
him
not
one
word
my
mother
agrees
with
this
she
would
have
told
you
herself
but
i
said
that
i
would
that
i
must
be
brave
i
must
learn
to
be
brave
i
can
tell
you
no
more
he
lifted
her
hands
and
stood
up
i
see
that
i
understand
nothing
that
you
say
after
all
he
said
with
a
fine
fatherly
dignity
i
must
talk
with
your
mother
ii
he
found
his
wife
half
an
hour
later
in
the
ladies
parlour
which
he
entered
with
an
air
as
of
nothing
to
say
with
the
same
air
of
disengagement
he
made
sure
that
marjorie
was
nowhere
in
the
room
and
presently
sat
down
mrs
manners
was
well
past
her
prime
she
was
over
forty
years
old
and
looked
over
fifty
though
she
retained
the
air
of
distinction
which
marjorie
had
derived
from
her
but
her
looks
belied
her
and
she
had
not
one
tithe
of
the
subtlety
and
keenness
of
her
daughter
she
was
in
fact
more
suited
to
be
wife
to
her
husband
than
mother
to
her
daughter
you
have
come
about
the
maid
she
said
instantly
with
disconcerting
penetration
and
frankness
well
i
know
no
more
than
you
she
will
tell
me
nothing
but
what
she
has
told
you
she
has
some
in
her
head
as
maids
will
but
she
will
have
her
way
with
us
i
suppose
she
drew
her
needle
through
the
piece
of
embroidery
which
she
permitted
to
herself
for
an
hour
on
sundays
knotted
the
thread
and
bit
it
off
then
she
regarded
her
husband
i
i
will
have
no
in
such
a
matter
he
said
courageously
maids
did
not
rule
their
parents
when
i
was
a
boy
they
obeyed
them
or
were
beaten
his
wife
laughed
shortly
and
began
to
thread
her
needle
again
he
began
to
explain
the
match
was
in
all
respects
suitable
certainly
there
were
difficulties
springing
from
the
very
startling
events
at
matstead
and
it
well
might
be
that
a
man
who
would
do
as
audrey
had
done
or
rather
proposed
to
do
might
show
obstinacy
in
other
directions
too
therefore
there
was
no
hurry
the
two
were
still
very
young
and
it
certainly
would
be
wiser
to
wait
for
any
formal
betrothal
until
robin
future
disclosed
itself
but
no
action
of
need
delay
the
betrothal
indefinitely
if
need
were
he
mr
manners
would
make
proper
settlements
marjorie
was
an
only
daughter
in
fact
she
was
in
some
sort
an
heiress
the
manor
would
be
sufficient
for
them
both
as
to
any
other
difficulties
any
of
the
maidenly
of
which
his
wife
had
spoken
this
should
not
stand
in
the
way
for
an
instant
his
wife
laughed
again
in
the
same
exclamatory
manner
when
he
had
done
and
sat
stroking
his
knees
why
you
understand
nothing
about
it
mr
manners
she
said
did
the
maid
not
tell
you
she
would
marry
him
if
he
wished
it
she
told
me
so
then
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
i
know
no
more
than
you
does
he
not
wish
it
she
says
so
then
yes
that
is
what
i
say
and
yet
that
says
nothing
there
is
something
more
ask
her
i
have
asked
her
she
bids
me
wait
as
she
bids
you
it
is
no
good
mr
manners
we
must
wait
the
maid
time
he
sat
breathing
audibly
through
his
nose
these
two
were
devoted
to
their
daughter
in
a
manner
hardly
to
be
described
she
was
the
only
one
left
to
them
for
the
others
of
whom
two
had
been
boys
had
died
in
infancy
or
childhood
and
in
the
event
marjorie
had
absorbed
the
love
due
to
them
all
she
was
a
strain
higher
than
themselves
thought
her
parents
and
so
pride
in
her
was
added
to
love
the
mother
had
made
incredible
sacrifices
first
to
have
her
educated
by
a
couple
of
old
nuns
who
still
survived
in
derby
and
then
to
bring
her
out
suitably
at
babington
house
last
year
the
father
had
cordially
approved
and
joined
in
the
sacrifices
which
included
an
expenditure
which
he
would
not
have
thought
conceivable
the
result
was
of
course
that
marjorie
under
cover
of
a
very
real
dutifulness
ruled
both
her
parents
completely
her
mother
acknowledged
the
dominion
at
least
to
herself
and
her
husband
her
father
pretended
that
he
did
not
and
on
this
occasion
rose
perhaps
nearer
to
repudiating
it
than
ever
in
his
life
it
seemed
to
him
unbearable
to
be
bidden
by
his
daughter
though
with
the
utmost
courtesy
and
affection
to
mind
his
own
business
so
he
sat
and
breathed
audibly
through
his
nose
and
meditated
rebellion
and
is
the
lad
to
come
here
for
easter
he
asked
at
last
i
suppose
so
and
for
how
long
so
long
as
the
maid
appoints
he
breathed
louder
than
ever
and
mr
manners
continued
his
wife
emphatically
no
word
must
be
said
to
him
on
the
matter
the
maid
is
very
plain
as
to
that
oh
we
must
let
her
have
her
way
where
is
she
gone
she
nodded
with
her
head
to
the
window
he
went
to
it
and
looked
out
it
was
the
little
walled
garden
on
which
he
looked
in
which
if
he
had
but
known
it
the
lad
whom
he
liked
had
kissed
the
maid
whom
he
loved
and
there
walked
the
maid
at
this
moment
with
her
back
to
him
going
up
the
central
path
that
was
bordered
with
box
the
february
sun
shone
on
her
as
she
went
on
her
hooded
head
her
dark
cloak
and
her
blue
dress
beneath
he
watched
her
go
up
and
drew
back
a
little
as
she
turned
so
that
she
might
not
see
him
watching
and
as
she
came
down
again
he
saw
that
she
held
a
string
of
beads
in
her
fingers
and
was
making
her
devotions
she
was
a
good
girl
that
at
least
was
a
satisfaction
then
he
turned
from
the
window
again
well
said
his
wife
i
suppose
it
must
be
as
she
says
iii
it
was
an
hour
before
sunset
when
marjorie
came
out
again
into
the
walled
garden
that
had
become
for
her
now
a
kind
of
sanctuary
and
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
letter
sealed
and
inscribed
on
the
outside
the
following
words
were
written
to
robin
audrey
at
matstead
haste
haste
haste
within
the
sheet
was
covered
from
top
to
bottom
with
the
neat
she
had
learnt
from
the
nuns
the
most
of
it
does
not
concern
us
it
began
with
such
words
as
you
would
expect
from
a
maid
to
her
lover
it
continued
to
inform
him
that
her
parents
were
willing
and
indeed
desirous
that
he
should
come
to
them
for
easter
and
that
her
father
would
write
a
formal
letter
later
to
invite
him
it
was
to
be
written
from
derby
this
conspirator
informed
the
other
that
it
might
cause
less
comment
when
audrey
saw
it
and
was
to
be
expressed
in
terms
that
would
satisfy
him
finally
it
closed
as
it
had
begun
and
was
subscribed
by
his
loving
friend
one
paragraph
however
is
worth
attention
i
have
told
my
father
and
mother
that
we
love
one
another
my
robin
and
that
you
have
asked
me
to
marry
you
and
that
i
have
consented
should
you
wish
to
do
so
when
the
time
comes
they
have
consented
most
willingly
and
so
jesu
have
you
in
his
keeping
and
guide
your
mind
aright
it
was
this
paragraph
that
had
cost
her
half
of
the
hour
occupied
in
writing
for
it
must
be
expressed
just
so
and
no
otherwise
and
its
wording
had
cost
her
agony
lest
on
the
one
side
she
should
tell
him
too
much
and
on
the
other
too
little
and
her
agony
was
not
yet
over
for
she
had
to
face
its
sending
and
the
thought
of
all
that
it
might
cost
her
she
was
to
give
it
to
one
of
the
men
who
was
to
leave
early
for
derby
next
morning
and
was
to
deliver
it
at
matstead
on
the
road
so
she
brought
it
out
now
to
her
sanctuary
to
spread
it
like
the
old
king
of
israel
before
the
lord
there
was
a
promise
of
frost
in
the
air
underfoot
the
moisture
of
the
path
was
beginning
not
yet
to
stiffen
but
rather
to
withdraw
itself
and
there
was
a
cold
clearness
in
the
air
over
the
wall
beside
the
house
beyond
the
leafless
trees
which
barred
it
like
burned
the
sunset
deepening
and
glowing
redder
every
instant
yet
she
felt
nothing
of
the
cold
for
a
fire
was
within
her
as
she
went
again
up
and
down
the
path
on
which
her
father
had
watched
her
walk
a
fire
of
which
as
yet
she
could
not
discern
the
fuel
the
love
of
robin
was
there
that
she
knew
and
the
love
of
christ
was
there
so
she
thought
and
yet
where
the
divine
and
the
human
passion
mingled
she
could
not
tell
nor
whether
indeed
for
certain
it
were
the
love
of
christ
at
all
and
not
a
vain
imagination
of
her
own
as
to
how
christ
in
this
case
would
be
loved
only
she
knew
that
across
her
love
for
robin
a
shadow
had
fallen
she
could
scarcely
tell
when
it
had
first
come
to
her
and
whence
yet
it
had
so
come
it
had
deepened
rapidly
and
strongly
during
the
mass
that
simpson
had
said
and
behold
in
its
very
darkness
there
was
light
and
so
it
had
continued
till
confusion
had
fallen
on
her
which
none
but
robin
could
dissolve
it
must
be
his
word
finally
that
must
give
her
the
answer
to
her
doubts
and
she
must
make
it
easy
for
him
to
give
it
he
must
know
that
is
that
she
loved
him
more
passionately
than
ever
that
her
heart
would
break
if
she
had
not
her
desire
and
yet
that
she
would
not
hold
him
back
if
a
love
that
was
greater
than
hers
could
be
for
him
or
his
for
her
called
him
to
another
wedding
than
that
of
which
either
had
yet
spoken
a
broken
heart
and
god
will
done
would
be
better
than
that
god
will
should
be
avoided
and
her
own
satisfied
it
was
this
kind
of
considerations
therefore
that
sent
her
swiftly
to
and
fro
up
and
down
the
path
under
the
darkening
sky
if
they
can
be
called
considerations
which
beat
on
the
mind
like
a
clamour
of
shouting
and
as
she
went
she
strove
to
offer
all
to
god
she
entreated
him
to
do
his
will
yet
not
to
break
her
heart
to
break
her
heart
yet
not
robin
to
break
both
her
heart
and
robin
if
that
will
could
not
otherwise
be
served
her
lips
moved
now
and
again
as
she
went
but
her
eyes
were
downcast
and
her
face
untroubled
as
the
bell
in
the
court
rang
for
supper
she
went
to
the
door
and
looked
through
the
man
was
just
saddling
up
in
the
opposite
jack
she
called
here
is
the
letter
take
if
safely
then
she
went
in
to
supper
chapter
vi
i
it
was
a
great
day
and
a
solemn
when
the
squire
of
matstead
went
to
protestant
communion
for
the
first
time
it
was
easter
day
too
but
this
was
less
in
the
consideration
of
the
village
there
was
first
the
minister
barton
in
a
condition
of
excited
geniality
from
an
early
hour
he
was
observed
soon
after
it
was
light
by
an
old
man
who
was
up
betimes
hurrying
up
the
village
street
in
his
minister
cassock
and
gown
presumably
on
his
way
to
see
that
all
preparations
were
complete
for
the
solemnity
his
wife
was
seen
to
follow
him
a
few
minutes
later
by
eight
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
were
assembled
at
points
of
vantage
some
openly
at
their
doors
others
at
the
windows
and
groups
from
the
more
distant
farms
decked
suitably
stood
at
all
corners
to
be
greeted
presently
by
their
minister
hurrying
back
once
more
from
the
church
to
bring
the
communion
vessels
and
the
bread
and
wine
the
four
or
five
soldiers
of
the
village
a
couple
of
billmen
and
pikemen
and
a
real
gunner
stood
apart
in
an
official
group
but
did
not
salute
him
he
did
not
speak
of
that
which
was
in
the
minds
of
all
but
he
waved
a
hand
to
this
man
bid
a
happy
easter
to
another
and
disappeared
within
his
lodgings
leaving
a
wake
of
excitement
behind
him
by
a
quarter
before
nine
the
three
bells
had
begun
to
jangle
from
the
tower
and
the
crowd
had
increased
largely
when
barton
once
more
passed
to
the
church
in
the
spring
sunshine
followed
by
the
more
devout
who
wished
to
pray
and
the
more
timid
who
feared
a
disturbance
for
sentiments
were
not
wholly
on
the
squire
side
there
was
first
a
number
of
catholics
openly
confessed
or
at
least
secretly
catholic
though
these
were
not
in
full
force
since
most
were
gone
to
padley
before
dawn
and
there
was
next
a
certain
sentiment
abroad
even
amongst
those
who
conformed
in
favour
of
tradition
that
the
squire
of
matstead
should
be
a
catholic
was
at
least
as
fundamental
an
article
of
faith
as
that
the
minister
should
be
a
protestant
there
was
little
or
no
here
men
still
shook
their
heads
sympathetically
over
the
old
days
and
the
old
faith
which
indeed
had
ceased
to
be
the
faith
of
all
scarcely
twenty
years
ago
and
it
appeared
to
the
most
of
them
that
the
proper
faith
of
the
quality
since
they
had
before
their
eyes
such
families
as
the
babingtons
the
fentons
and
the
fitzherberts
was
that
to
which
their
own
squire
was
about
to
say
it
was
known
too
publicly
by
now
that
robin
was
gone
away
for
easter
since
he
would
not
follow
his
father
so
the
crowd
waited
the
dogs
sunned
themselves
and
the
gunner
sat
on
a
wall
the
bells
ceased
at
nine
and
upon
the
moment
a
group
came
round
the
churchyard
wall
down
from
the
and
the
stile
that
led
to
the
manor
first
walking
alone
came
the
squire
swiftly
and
steadily
his
face
was
flushed
a
little
but
set
and
determined
he
was
in
his
fine
clothes
ruff
and
all
his
rapier
was
looped
at
his
side
and
he
carried
a
stick
behind
him
came
three
or
four
farm
servants
then
a
yeoman
and
his
wife
and
last
at
a
little
distance
three
or
four
onlookers
there
was
dead
silence
as
he
came
the
hum
of
talk
died
at
the
corners
the
bells
clamour
had
even
now
ceased
it
seemed
as
if
each
man
waited
for
his
neighbour
to
speak
there
was
only
the
sound
of
the
brisk
footsteps
on
the
few
yards
of
cobbles
that
paved
the
walk
up
to
the
at
the
door
of
the
church
seen
beyond
him
was
a
crowd
of
faces
then
a
man
called
something
aloud
from
fifty
yards
away
but
there
was
no
voice
to
echo
him
the
folk
just
watched
their
lord
go
by
staring
on
him
as
on
some
strange
sight
forgetting
even
to
salute
him
and
so
in
silence
he
passed
on
ii
within
the
church
murmured
with
low
talking
already
of
it
was
full
and
all
faces
turned
and
to
the
door
at
every
footstep
or
sound
as
the
bells
ceased
a
sigh
went
up
as
if
a
giant
drew
breath
then
once
again
the
murmuring
began
the
church
was
as
most
were
in
those
days
it
was
but
a
little
place
yet
it
had
had
in
old
days
great
treasures
of
beauty
there
had
been
until
some
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
a
carved
screen
that
ran
across
the
chancel
arch
with
the
rood
upon
it
and
mary
and
john
on
this
side
and
that
the
it
was
remembered
had
been
of
stone
throughout
surrounded
with
curtains
on
the
three
sides
hanging
between
posts
that
had
each
a
carven
angel
all
gilt
now
all
was
gone
excepting
only
the
painted
windows
since
glass
was
costly
the
chancel
was
as
bare
as
a
barn
beneath
the
whitewash
high
over
the
place
where
the
old
canopy
had
hung
pale
colours
still
glimmered
through
where
twelve
years
ago
christ
had
sat
crowning
his
mother
the
altar
was
gone
its
holy
slab
served
now
as
the
pavement
within
the
west
door
where
the
superstitious
took
pains
to
step
clear
of
it
the
screen
was
gone
part
lay
beneath
the
tower
part
had
been
burned
christ
cross
held
up
the
roof
of
the
shed
where
the
minister
kept
his
horse
the
three
figures
had
been
carted
off
to
derby
to
help
swell
the
protestant
bonfire
the
projecting
stoup
to
the
right
of
the
main
door
had
been
broken
half
off
in
place
of
these
glories
there
stood
now
in
the
body
of
the
church
before
the
a
great
table
such
as
the
rubrics
of
the
new
required
spread
with
a
white
cloth
upon
which
now
rested
two
tall
pewter
flagons
of
wine
a
flat
pewter
plate
as
great
as
a
small
dish
and
two
silver
all
new
and
to
one
side
of
this
in
a
new
wainscoted
desk
waited
worthy
barton
for
the
coming
of
his
squire
a
happy
man
that
day
his
face
beamed
in
the
spring
sunlight
he
had
on
his
silk
gown
and
he
eyed
openly
the
door
through
which
his
new
patron
was
to
come
then
without
sound
or
warning
except
for
the
footsteps
on
the
and
the
sudden
darkening
of
the
sunshine
on
the
floor
there
came
the
figure
for
which
all
looked
as
he
entered
he
lifted
his
hand
to
his
head
but
dropped
it
again
and
passed
on
sturdy
and
you
would
have
said
honest
and
resolute
too
to
his
seat
behind
the
he
was
met
by
silence
he
was
escorted
by
silence
and
in
silence
he
sat
down
then
the
waiting
crowd
surged
in
poured
this
way
and
that
and
flowed
into
the
benches
and
barton
voice
was
raised
in
holy
exhortation
at
what
time
soever
a
sinner
doth
repent
him
of
his
sin
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
i
will
put
all
his
wickedness
out
of
remembrance
with
the
lord
iii
those
who
could
best
observe
for
the
tale
was
handed
on
with
the
careful
accuracy
of
those
who
can
not
read
or
write
professed
themselves
amazed
at
the
assured
ease
of
the
squire
no
sound
came
from
the
seat
behind
the
where
he
sat
alone
and
during
the
prayers
when
he
stood
or
kneeled
he
moved
as
if
he
understood
well
enough
what
he
was
at
a
great
bound
it
was
known
rested
before
him
on
the
and
he
was
observed
to
turn
the
pages
more
than
once
it
was
indeed
a
heavy
task
that
barton
had
to
do
for
first
there
was
the
morning
prayer
with
its
psalms
its
lessons
and
its
prayers
next
the
litany
and
last
the
communion
in
the
course
of
which
was
delivered
one
of
the
homilies
set
forth
by
authority
especially
designed
for
the
support
of
those
who
were
no
preachers
preceded
and
followed
by
a
psalm
but
all
was
easy
to
a
man
who
had
such
cause
for
exultation
his
voice
boomed
heartily
out
his
face
radiated
his
pleasure
and
he
delivered
his
homily
when
the
time
came
with
excellent
emphasis
and
power
all
from
the
except
the
communion
yet
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
the
attention
of
those
that
heard
him
was
where
their
pastor
would
have
desired
it
to
be
since
even
to
these
the
drama
of
the
whole
was
evident
there
seen
full
when
he
sat
down
and
in
part
when
he
kneeled
and
stood
was
the
man
who
hitherto
had
stood
to
them
for
the
old
order
the
old
faith
the
old
tradition
the
man
whose
horse
footsteps
had
been
heard
times
and
again
before
dawn
in
the
village
street
bearing
him
to
the
mystery
of
the
mass
through
whose
gate
strangers
had
ridden
perhaps
three
or
four
times
in
the
year
to
find
harbourage
strangers
dressed
indeed
as
plain
gentlemen
or
yeomen
yet
known
every
one
of
them
to
be
under
her
grace
ban
and
to
ride
in
peril
of
liberty
if
not
of
life
yet
here
he
sat
a
man
feared
and
even
loved
by
some
the
first
of
his
line
to
yield
to
circumstance
and
to
make
peace
with
his
times
not
a
man
of
all
who
looked
on
him
believed
him
certainly
to
be
that
which
his
actions
professed
him
to
be
some
doubted
especially
those
who
themselves
inclined
to
the
old
ways
or
secretly
followed
them
and
the
hearts
of
these
grew
sick
as
they
watched
but
the
crown
and
climax
was
yet
to
come
the
minister
finished
at
last
the
homily
it
was
one
which
inveighed
more
than
once
against
the
popish
superstitions
and
he
had
chosen
it
for
that
reason
to
clench
the
bargain
so
to
say
all
in
due
order
for
he
was
a
careful
man
and
observed
his
instructions
unlike
some
of
his
brethren
who
did
as
they
pleased
and
came
back
again
to
the
long
north
side
of
the
table
to
finish
the
service
he
had
no
man
to
help
him
so
he
was
forced
to
do
it
all
for
himself
so
he
went
forward
gallantly
first
reading
a
set
of
scripture
sentences
while
the
officers
collected
first
for
the
and
then
as
it
was
one
of
the
collected
again
the
dues
for
the
curate
it
was
largely
upon
these
in
such
poor
parishes
as
was
this
that
the
minister
depended
and
his
wife
then
he
went
on
to
pray
for
the
whole
estate
of
christ
church
militant
here
on
earth
especially
for
god
servant
elizabeth
our
queen
that
under
her
we
may
be
godly
and
quietly
governed
then
came
the
exhortation
urging
any
who
might
think
himself
to
be
a
blasphemer
of
god
an
hinderer
or
slanderer
of
his
word
or
to
be
in
malice
or
envy
to
bewail
his
sins
and
not
to
come
to
this
holy
table
lest
after
the
taking
of
that
holy
sacrament
the
devil
enter
into
him
as
he
entered
into
judas
and
fill
him
full
of
all
iniquities
so
forward
with
the
rest
he
read
the
comfortable
words
the
english
equivalent
for
sursum
corda
with
the
easter
preface
then
another
prayer
and
finally
rehearsed
the
story
of
the
institution
of
the
most
holy
sacrament
though
without
any
blessing
of
the
bread
and
wine
at
least
by
any
action
since
none
such
was
ordered
in
the
new
then
he
immediately
received
the
bread
and
wine
himself
and
stood
up
again
holding
the
silver
plate
in
his
hand
for
an
instant
before
proceeding
to
the
squire
seat
to
give
him
the
communion
meantime
so
great
was
the
expectation
and
interest
that
it
was
not
until
the
minister
had
moved
from
the
table
that
the
first
communicants
began
to
come
up
to
the
two
benches
left
empty
till
now
next
to
the
table
then
those
who
still
watched
and
who
spread
the
tale
about
afterwards
saw
that
the
squire
did
not
move
from
his
seat
to
kneel
down
he
had
put
off
his
hat
again
after
the
homily
and
had
so
sat
ever
since
and
now
that
the
minister
came
to
him
still
there
he
sat
now
such
a
manner
of
receiving
was
not
unknown
yet
it
was
the
sign
of
a
puritan
and
so
far
from
the
folk
expecting
such
behaviour
in
their
squire
they
had
looked
rather
for
popish
gestures
knockings
on
the
breast
signs
of
the
cross
for
a
moment
the
minister
stood
before
the
seat
as
if
doubtful
what
to
do
he
held
the
plate
in
his
left
hand
and
a
fragment
of
bread
in
his
fingers
then
as
he
began
the
words
he
had
to
say
one
thing
at
least
the
people
saw
and
that
was
that
a
great
flush
dyed
the
old
man
face
though
he
sat
quiet
then
as
the
minister
held
out
the
bread
the
squire
seemed
to
recover
himself
he
put
out
his
fingers
quickly
took
the
bread
sharply
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
and
so
sat
again
until
the
minister
brought
the
cup
and
this
too
he
drank
of
quickly
and
gave
it
back
then
as
the
communicants
one
by
one
took
the
bread
and
wine
and
went
back
to
their
seats
man
after
man
glanced
up
at
the
squire
but
the
squire
sat
there
motionless
and
upright
like
a
figure
cut
of
stone
iv
the
court
of
the
manor
seemed
deserted
half
an
hour
before
there
was
a
sabbath
stillness
in
the
air
sweetened
as
it
were
by
the
bubbling
of
in
the
pleasaunce
behind
the
hall
and
the
high
woods
beyond
on
the
strips
of
rough
turf
before
the
gate
and
within
it
bloomed
the
spring
flowers
white
and
blue
a
hound
lay
stretched
in
the
sunshine
on
the
hall
steps
twitching
his
ears
to
keep
off
a
persistent
fly
you
would
have
sworn
that
his
was
the
only
intelligence
in
the
place
yet
at
the
sound
of
the
iron
latch
of
the
gate
and
the
squire
footsteps
on
the
stones
the
place
so
to
say
became
alive
though
in
a
furtive
and
secret
manner
over
the
half
door
of
the
stable
entrance
on
the
left
two
faces
appeared
one
which
was
dick
sullen
and
angry
the
other
that
of
a
inquiring
and
frankly
interested
this
second
vanished
again
as
the
squire
came
forward
a
figure
of
a
in
a
white
apron
showed
in
the
dark
doorway
that
led
to
the
kitchen
and
hall
and
disappeared
again
instantly
from
two
or
three
upper
windows
faces
peeped
and
remained
fascinated
only
the
old
hound
remained
still
twitching
his
ears
all
this
though
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
familiar
personage
of
the
place
in
his
hat
and
cloak
and
sword
walking
through
his
own
court
on
his
way
to
dinner
as
he
had
walked
a
thousand
times
before
and
yet
so
great
was
the
significance
of
his
coming
that
the
very
gate
behind
him
was
pushed
open
by
sightseers
who
had
followed
at
a
safe
distance
up
the
path
from
the
church
half
a
dozen
stood
there
staring
and
behind
them
at
intervals
a
score
more
spread
out
in
groups
all
the
way
down
to
the
porter
lodge
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
all
was
the
silence
not
a
voice
there
spoke
even
in
a
whisper
the
maids
at
the
windows
above
dick
glowering
over
the
half
door
the
little
group
which
far
back
in
the
kitchen
entrance
peeped
and
rustled
the
men
at
the
gate
behind
even
the
boys
in
the
path
all
these
held
their
tongues
for
interest
and
a
kind
of
fear
drama
was
in
the
air
the
tragedy
of
seeing
the
squire
come
back
from
church
for
the
first
time
bearing
himself
as
he
always
did
resolute
and
sturdy
yet
changed
in
his
significance
after
a
fashion
of
which
none
of
these
simple
hearts
had
ever
dreamed
so
again
in
silence
he
went
up
the
court
knowing
that
eyes
were
upon
him
yet
showing
no
sign
that
he
knew
it
he
went
up
the
steps
with
the
same
assured
air
and
disappeared
into
the
hall
then
the
spell
broke
up
and
the
bustle
began
for
it
was
only
half
an
hour
to
dinner
and
guests
were
coming
first
dick
came
out
slashing
to
the
door
behind
him
and
strode
out
to
the
gate
he
was
still
in
his
boots
for
he
had
ridden
to
padley
and
back
since
early
morning
with
a
couple
of
the
maids
and
the
he
went
to
the
gate
of
the
court
the
group
dissolving
as
he
came
and
shut
it
in
their
faces
a
noise
of
talking
came
out
of
the
kitchen
windows
and
the
clash
of
a
saucepan
the
maids
heads
vanished
from
the
upper
windows
even
as
dick
shut
the
gate
he
heard
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
down
by
the
porter
lodge
the
justices
were
coming
the
two
whose
names
he
had
heard
with
amazement
last
week
as
the
last
corroboration
of
the
incredible
rumour
of
his
master
defection
for
these
were
a
couple
of
magistrates
harmless
men
indeed
as
regarded
their
hostility
to
the
old
faith
yet
protestants
who
had
sat
more
than
once
on
the
bench
in
derby
to
hear
cases
of
recusancy
old
marpleden
had
told
him
they
were
to
come
and
that
provision
must
be
made
for
their
horses
marpleden
the
ancient
housekeeper
of
the
manor
who
had
gone
to
school
for
a
while
with
the
benedictine
nuns
of
derby
in
king
henry
days
she
had
shaken
her
head
and
eyed
him
and
then
had
suffered
three
or
four
tears
to
fall
down
her
old
cheeks
well
they
were
coming
so
dick
must
open
the
gate
again
and
pull
the
bell
for
the
servants
and
this
he
did
and
waited
hat
in
hand
up
the
little
straight
road
they
came
with
a
servant
or
two
behind
them
the
two
harmless
gentlemen
chattering
as
they
rode
and
dick
loathed
them
in
his
heart
the
squire
is
within
yes
sir
they
dismounted
and
dick
held
their
stirrups
he
has
been
to
church
eh
dick
made
no
answer
he
feigned
to
be
busy
with
one
of
the
saddles
the
magistrate
glanced
at
him
sharply
v
it
was
a
strange
dinner
that
day
outwardly
again
all
was
as
usual
as
it
might
have
been
on
any
other
sunday
in
spring
the
three
gentlemen
sat
at
the
high
table
facing
down
the
hall
and
since
there
was
no
reading
and
since
it
was
a
festival
there
was
no
lack
of
conversation
the
servants
came
in
as
usual
with
the
dishes
there
was
roast
lamb
according
to
old
usage
among
the
rest
and
three
or
four
wines
a
little
fire
burned
against
the
reredos
for
cheerfulness
rather
than
warmth
and
the
spring
sunshine
flowed
in
through
the
windows
bright
and
genial
yet
the
difference
was
profound
certainly
there
was
no
talk
overheard
at
least
by
the
servants
which
might
not
have
been
on
any
sunday
for
the
last
twenty
years
the
congratulations
and
good
wishes
or
whatever
they
were
must
have
been
spoken
between
the
three
in
the
parlour
before
dinner
and
they
spoke
now
of
harmless
usual
things
news
of
the
countryside
and
tales
from
derby
gossip
of
affairs
of
state
of
her
grace
who
in
a
manner
unthinkable
even
by
now
dominated
the
imagination
of
england
none
of
these
three
had
ever
seen
her
the
squire
had
been
to
london
but
once
in
his
life
his
two
guests
never
yet
they
talked
of
her
of
her
of
her
romanticism
they
told
little
tales
one
to
the
other
as
if
she
lived
in
the
county
town
all
this
then
was
harmless
enough
religion
was
not
mentioned
in
the
hearing
of
the
servants
neither
the
old
nor
the
new
they
talked
all
three
of
them
and
the
squire
loudest
of
all
though
with
pauses
of
pregnant
silence
of
such
things
as
children
might
have
heard
without
dismay
yet
to
the
servants
who
came
and
went
it
was
as
if
their
master
were
another
man
altogether
and
his
hall
some
unknown
place
there
was
no
blessing
of
himself
before
meat
he
said
something
indeed
before
he
sat
down
but
it
was
unintelligible
and
he
made
no
movement
with
his
hand
but
it
was
deeper
than
this
and
his
men
who
had
served
him
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
looked
on
him
as
upon
a
stranger
or
a
changeling
chapter
vii
i
the
same
easter
day
at
padley
was
another
matter
altogether
as
early
as
five
in
the
morning
the
house
was
astir
lights
glimmered
in
upper
rooms
footsteps
passed
along
corridors
and
across
the
court
parties
began
to
arrive
all
was
done
without
ostentation
yet
without
concealment
for
padley
was
a
solitary
place
and
had
no
fear
at
this
time
of
a
sudden
descent
of
the
authorities
for
sake
scarcely
for
more
a
man
kept
watch
over
the
valley
road
and
signalled
by
the
flashing
of
a
lamp
twice
every
party
with
which
he
was
acquainted
and
there
were
no
others
than
these
to
signal
a
second
man
waited
by
the
gate
into
the
court
to
admit
them
they
rode
and
walked
in
from
all
round
great
gentlemen
such
as
the
north
lees
family
came
with
a
small
retinue
a
few
came
alone
yeomen
and
farm
servants
with
their
from
the
hathersage
valley
came
for
the
most
part
on
foot
altogether
perhaps
a
hundred
and
twenty
persons
were
within
padley
manor
and
the
gate
secured
by
six
meanwhile
within
the
priest
had
been
busy
since
four
with
the
hearing
of
confessions
he
sat
in
the
chapel
beside
the
undecked
altar
and
they
came
to
him
one
by
one
the
household
and
a
few
of
the
nearer
neighbours
had
done
their
duty
in
this
matter
the
day
before
and
a
good
number
had
already
made
their
easter
duties
earlier
in
lent
so
by
six
all
was
finished
then
began
the
bustle
a
group
of
ladies
fitzherberts
and
fentons
entered
so
soon
as
the
priest
gave
the
signal
by
tapping
on
the
parlour
wall
bearing
all
things
necessary
for
the
altar
and
it
was
astonishing
what
fine
things
these
were
so
that
by
the
time
that
the
priest
was
ready
to
vest
the
place
was
transformed
stuffs
and
embroideries
hung
upon
the
wall
about
the
altar
making
it
seem
indeed
a
sanctuary
two
tall
silver
candlesticks
used
for
no
other
purpose
stood
upon
the
linen
cloths
under
which
rested
the
slate
taken
with
the
sacred
vessels
and
the
vestments
from
one
of
the
privy
with
whose
secret
not
a
living
being
without
the
house
and
not
more
than
two
or
three
within
was
acquainted
it
was
rumored
that
half
a
dozen
such
places
had
been
contrived
within
the
precincts
two
of
which
were
great
enough
to
hold
two
or
three
men
at
a
pinch
soon
after
six
then
the
altar
was
ready
and
the
priest
stood
vested
he
retired
a
pace
from
the
altar
signed
himself
with
the
cross
and
with
john
fitzherbert
and
his
son
thomas
on
either
side
of
him
began
the
preparation
it
was
a
strange
and
an
inspiriting
sight
that
the
young
priest
for
it
was
simpson
who
was
saying
the
mass
looked
upon
as
he
turned
round
after
the
gospel
to
make
his
little
sermon
from
end
to
end
the
tiny
chapel
was
full
packed
so
that
few
could
kneel
and
none
sit
down
the
two
doors
were
open
and
here
two
faces
peered
in
and
behind
rank
after
rank
down
the
steps
and
along
the
little
passage
the
folk
stood
or
knelt
out
of
sight
of
both
priest
and
altar
and
almost
out
of
sound
the
sanctuary
was
full
of
children
whose
solemn
faces
looked
up
at
him
children
who
knew
little
or
nothing
of
what
was
passing
except
that
they
were
there
to
worship
god
but
who
for
all
that
received
impressions
and
associations
that
could
never
thereafter
wholly
leave
them
the
chapel
was
still
completely
dark
for
the
faint
light
of
dawn
was
excluded
by
the
heavy
hangings
over
the
windows
and
there
was
but
the
light
of
the
two
tapers
to
show
the
people
to
one
another
and
the
priest
to
them
all
it
was
an
inspiriting
sight
to
him
then
and
one
which
well
rewarded
him
for
his
labours
since
there
was
not
a
class
from
gentlemen
to
labourers
who
was
not
represented
there
the
fitzherberts
the
babingtons
the
fentons
these
with
their
servants
and
guests
accounted
for
perhaps
half
of
the
folk
from
the
shadow
by
the
door
peeped
out
the
faces
of
john
merton
and
his
wife
and
son
beneath
the
window
was
the
solemn
face
of
mr
manners
the
lawyer
with
his
daughter
beside
him
robin
audrey
beside
her
and
dick
his
servant
behind
him
surely
thought
the
young
priest
the
faith
could
not
be
in
its
final
decay
with
such
a
gathering
as
this
his
little
sermon
was
plain
enough
for
the
most
foolish
there
he
spoke
of
christ
resurrection
of
how
death
had
no
power
to
hold
him
nor
pains
nor
prison
to
detain
him
and
he
spoke
too
of
that
mystical
life
of
his
which
he
yet
lived
in
his
body
which
was
the
church
of
how
death
too
stretched
forth
his
hands
against
him
there
and
yet
had
no
more
force
to
hold
him
than
in
his
natural
life
lived
on
earth
near
sixteen
hundred
years
ago
how
a
resurrection
awaited
him
here
in
england
as
in
jerusalem
if
his
friends
would
be
constant
and
courageous
not
faithless
but
believing
even
here
he
said
in
this
upper
chamber
where
we
are
gathered
for
fear
of
the
jews
comes
jesus
and
stands
in
the
midst
the
doors
being
shut
upon
this
altar
he
will
be
presently
the
lamb
slain
yet
the
lamb
victorious
to
give
us
all
that
peace
which
the
world
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
and
he
added
a
few
words
of
exhortation
and
encouragement
bidding
them
fear
nothing
whatever
might
come
upon
them
in
the
future
to
hold
fast
to
the
faith
once
delivered
to
the
saints
and
so
to
attain
the
heavenly
crown
he
was
not
eloquent
for
he
was
but
a
young
man
newly
come
from
college
with
no
great
gifts
yet
not
a
soul
there
looked
upon
him
on
his
innocent
wondering
eyes
and
his
quivering
lips
but
was
moved
by
what
he
saw
and
heard
the
priest
signed
himself
with
the
cross
and
turned
again
to
continue
the
mass
ii
you
tell
me
then
said
the
girl
quietly
that
all
is
as
it
was
with
you
god
has
told
you
nothing
robin
was
silent
mass
had
been
done
an
hour
or
more
and
for
the
most
part
the
company
was
dispersed
again
after
refreshment
spread
in
the
hall
except
for
those
who
were
to
stay
to
dinner
and
these
two
had
slipped
away
at
last
to
talk
together
in
the
woods
for
the
court
was
still
filled
with
servants
coming
and
going
and
the
parlours
occupied
in
one
the
ladies
were
still
busy
with
the
altar
furniture
in
the
other
the
priest
sat
to
talk
in
private
with
those
who
were
come
from
a
distance
and
as
for
the
hall
this
too
was
in
the
hands
of
the
servants
since
not
less
than
thirty
gentle
folk
were
to
dine
there
that
day
robin
had
come
to
booth
edge
at
the
beginning
of
passion
week
and
had
been
there
ever
since
he
had
refrained
at
marjorie
entreaty
from
speaking
of
her
to
her
parents
and
they
too
ruled
by
their
daughter
had
held
their
tongues
on
the
matter
everything
else
however
had
been
discussed
the
effect
of
the
squire
apostasy
the
alternatives
that
presented
themselves
to
the
boy
the
future
behaviour
of
him
to
his
father
all
these
things
had
been
spoken
of
and
even
the
priest
called
into
council
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
yet
not
much
had
come
of
it
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
the
lawyer
had
offered
the
boy
a
place
in
his
office
anthony
babington
had
proposed
his
coming
to
dethick
if
his
father
turned
him
out
while
robin
himself
inclined
to
a
third
alternative
the
begging
of
his
father
to
give
him
a
sum
of
money
and
be
rid
of
him
after
which
he
proposed
with
youthful
vagueness
to
set
off
for
london
and
see
what
he
could
do
there
marjorie
however
had
seemed
strangely
uninterested
in
such
proposals
she
had
listened
with
patience
bowing
her
head
in
assent
to
each
beginning
once
or
twice
a
word
of
criticism
and
stopping
herself
before
she
had
well
begun
but
she
had
looked
at
robin
with
more
than
interest
and
her
mother
had
found
her
more
than
once
on
her
knees
in
her
own
chamber
in
tears
yet
she
had
said
nothing
except
that
she
would
speak
her
mind
after
easter
perhaps
and
now
it
seemed
she
was
doing
it
you
have
had
no
other
thought
she
said
again
besides
those
of
which
you
talked
with
my
father
they
were
walking
together
through
the
woods
half
a
mile
along
the
hathersage
valley
beneath
them
the
ground
fell
steeply
away
above
them
it
rose
as
steeply
to
the
right
underfoot
the
new
life
of
spring
was
bourgeoning
in
mould
and
grass
and
undergrowth
for
the
heather
did
not
come
down
so
far
as
this
and
the
daffodils
and
celandine
and
wild
hyacinth
lay
in
carpets
of
yellow
and
blue
infinitely
sweet
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
in
the
open
sunshine
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
squire
of
matstead
was
entering
the
church
and
hearing
of
the
promises
of
the
lord
to
the
sinner
who
forsook
his
sinful
ways
i
have
had
other
thoughts
said
the
boy
slowly
but
they
are
so
wild
and
foolish
that
i
have
determined
to
think
no
more
of
them
you
are
determined
he
bowed
his
head
you
are
sure
then
that
they
are
not
from
god
asked
the
girl
torn
between
fear
and
hope
he
was
silent
and
her
heart
sank
again
he
looked
indeed
a
bewildered
boy
borne
down
by
a
weight
that
was
too
heavy
for
his
years
he
walked
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
his
hatless
head
bowed
regarding
his
feet
and
the
last
year
leaves
on
which
he
walked
a
cuckoo
across
the
valley
called
with
the
insistence
of
one
who
will
be
answered
my
robin
said
the
girl
the
last
thing
i
would
have
you
do
is
to
tell
me
what
you
would
not
will
you
not
speak
to
the
priest
about
it
i
have
spoken
to
the
priest
yes
he
tells
me
he
does
not
know
what
to
think
would
you
do
this
thing
whatever
it
may
be
if
the
priest
told
you
it
was
god
will
there
was
a
pause
and
then
i
do
not
know
said
robin
so
low
she
could
scarcely
hear
him
she
drew
a
deep
breath
to
reassure
herself
listen
she
said
i
must
say
a
little
of
what
i
think
but
not
all
our
lord
must
finish
it
to
you
if
it
is
according
to
his
will
he
glanced
at
her
swiftly
and
down
again
like
a
frightened
child
yet
even
in
that
glance
he
could
see
that
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
to
force
herself
to
speak
and
by
that
look
he
understood
for
the
first
time
something
of
that
which
she
was
suffering
you
know
first
she
said
that
i
am
promised
to
you
i
hold
that
promise
as
sacred
as
anything
on
earth
can
be
her
voice
shook
a
little
the
boy
bowed
his
head
again
she
went
on
but
there
are
some
things
she
said
more
sacred
than
anything
on
earth
those
things
that
come
from
heaven
now
i
wish
to
say
this
and
then
have
done
with
it
that
if
such
should
be
god
will
i
would
not
hold
you
for
a
day
we
are
catholics
you
and
i
your
father
her
voice
broke
and
she
stopped
yet
without
leaving
go
of
her
hold
upon
herself
only
she
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
a
great
fury
seized
on
the
boy
it
was
one
of
those
angers
that
for
a
while
poison
the
air
and
turn
all
things
sour
yet
without
obscuring
the
mind
an
anger
in
which
the
angry
one
strikes
first
at
that
which
he
loves
most
because
he
loves
it
most
knowing
too
that
the
words
he
speaks
are
false
for
this
for
the
present
was
the
in
the
lad
he
had
suffered
torments
in
his
soul
ever
since
the
hour
in
which
he
had
ridden
into
the
gate
of
his
own
home
after
his
talk
in
the
empty
chapel
he
had
striven
to
put
away
from
him
that
idea
for
which
the
girl
words
had
broken
an
entrance
into
his
heart
and
now
she
would
give
him
no
peace
she
continued
to
press
on
him
from
without
that
which
already
pained
him
within
so
he
turned
on
her
you
wish
to
be
rid
of
me
he
cried
fiercely
she
looked
at
him
with
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
astonished
and
her
face
gone
white
what
did
you
say
she
said
his
conscience
pierced
him
like
a
sword
yet
he
set
his
teeth
you
wish
to
be
rid
of
me
you
are
urging
me
to
leave
you
you
talk
to
me
of
god
will
and
god
voice
and
you
have
no
pity
on
me
at
all
it
is
an
excuse
a
blind
he
stood
raging
the
very
fact
that
he
knew
every
word
to
be
false
made
his
energy
the
greater
for
he
could
not
have
said
it
otherwise
you
think
that
she
whispered
there
then
they
stood
eyeing
one
another
a
stranger
coming
suddenly
upon
them
would
have
said
it
was
a
lovers
tiff
and
have
laughed
at
it
yet
it
was
a
deeper
matter
than
that
then
there
surged
over
the
boy
a
wave
of
shame
and
the
truth
prevailed
his
fair
face
went
scarlet
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
dropped
on
his
knees
in
the
leaves
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
oh
you
must
forgive
me
he
said
but
but
i
can
not
do
it
iii
it
was
a
great
occasion
in
the
hall
that
easter
day
the
three
tables
which
according
to
custom
ran
along
the
walls
were
filled
with
guests
and
a
second
dinner
was
to
follow
scarcely
less
splendid
than
the
first
for
their
servants
as
well
as
for
those
of
the
household
the
floor
was
spread
with
new
rushes
jugs
of
march
beer
a
full
month
old
as
it
should
be
were
ranged
down
the
tables
and
by
every
plate
lay
a
posy
of
flowers
from
the
passage
outside
came
the
sound
of
music
the
feast
began
with
the
reading
of
the
gospel
at
the
close
john
struck
with
his
hand
upon
the
table
as
a
signal
for
conversation
the
doors
opened
the
servants
came
in
and
a
babble
of
talk
broke
out
at
the
high
table
the
master
of
the
house
presided
with
the
priest
on
his
right
mrs
manners
and
marjorie
beyond
him
on
his
left
fenton
and
her
lord
at
the
other
two
tables
thomas
presided
at
one
and
babington
at
the
other
the
talk
was
of
course
within
the
bounds
of
discretion
though
once
and
again
sentences
were
spoken
which
would
scarcely
have
pleased
the
minister
of
the
parish
for
they
were
difficult
times
in
which
they
lived
and
it
is
no
wonder
at
all
if
bitterness
mixed
itself
with
charity
here
was
john
for
instance
come
to
padley
expressly
for
the
selling
of
some
meadows
to
meet
his
fines
here
was
his
son
thomas
the
heir
now
not
only
to
padley
but
to
norbury
whose
lord
his
uncle
lay
in
the
fleet
prison
here
was
fenton
who
had
suffered
the
like
in
the
matter
of
fines
more
than
once
hardly
one
of
the
folk
there
but
had
paid
a
heavy
price
for
his
conscience
and
all
the
worship
that
was
permitted
to
them
and
that
by
circumstance
and
not
by
law
was
such
as
they
had
engaged
in
that
morning
with
shuttered
windows
and
a
sentinel
for
fear
that
too
should
be
silenced
they
talked
then
guardedly
of
those
things
since
the
servants
were
in
and
out
continually
and
though
all
professed
the
same
faith
as
their
masters
yet
these
were
times
that
tried
loyalty
hard
john
indeed
gave
news
of
his
brother
sir
thomas
and
said
how
he
did
and
read
a
letter
too
from
italy
from
his
younger
brother
nicholas
who
was
fled
abroad
after
a
year
prison
at
oxford
but
the
climax
of
the
talk
came
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
muscadel
with
the
had
been
put
upon
the
tables
it
was
at
this
moment
that
john
nodded
to
his
son
who
went
to
the
door
to
see
the
servants
out
and
stood
by
it
to
see
that
none
listened
then
his
father
struck
his
hands
together
for
silence
and
himself
spoke
simpson
he
said
has
something
to
say
to
us
all
it
is
not
a
matter
to
be
spoken
of
lightly
as
you
will
understand
presently
mr
simpson
the
priest
looked
up
timidly
pulling
out
a
paper
from
his
pocket
you
have
heard
of
mr
nelson
he
said
to
the
company
well
he
was
a
priest
and
i
have
news
of
his
death
he
was
executed
in
london
on
the
third
of
february
for
his
religion
and
another
man
a
sherwood
was
executed
a
few
days
afterwards
there
was
a
rustle
along
the
benches
some
there
had
heard
of
the
fact
but
no
more
some
had
heard
nothing
of
either
the
man
or
his
death
two
or
three
faces
turned
a
shade
paler
and
then
the
silence
settled
down
again
for
here
was
a
matter
that
touched
them
all
closely
enough
since
up
to
now
scarcely
a
priest
except
cuthbert
maine
had
suffered
death
for
his
religion
and
even
of
him
some
of
the
more
tolerant
said
that
it
was
treason
with
which
he
was
charged
they
had
heard
indeed
of
a
priest
or
two
having
been
sent
abroad
into
exile
for
his
faith
but
the
most
of
them
thought
it
a
thing
incredible
that
in
england
at
this
time
a
man
should
suffer
death
for
it
fines
and
imprisonment
were
one
thing
to
such
they
had
become
almost
accustomed
but
death
was
another
matter
altogether
and
for
a
priest
was
it
possible
that
the
days
of
king
harry
were
coming
back
and
that
every
catholic
henceforth
should
go
in
peril
of
his
life
as
well
as
of
liberty
the
folks
settled
themselves
then
in
their
seats
one
or
two
men
drank
off
a
glass
of
wine
i
have
heard
from
a
good
friend
of
mine
in
london
went
on
the
priest
looking
at
his
paper
one
who
followed
every
step
of
the
trial
and
was
present
at
the
death
they
suffered
at
tyburn
however
i
will
tell
you
what
he
says
he
is
a
countryman
of
mine
from
yorkshire
as
was
nelson
too
nelson
was
taken
in
london
on
the
first
of
december
last
year
he
was
born
at
shelton
and
was
about
years
old
he
was
the
son
of
sir
nicholas
nelson
so
much
said
the
priest
looking
up
from
his
paper
i
knew
myself
i
saw
him
about
four
years
ago
just
before
he
went
to
douay
and
he
came
back
to
england
as
a
priest
a
year
and
a
half
after
sherwood
was
not
a
priest
he
had
been
at
douay
too
but
as
a
scholar
only
well
we
will
speak
of
nelson
first
this
is
what
my
friend
says
he
spread
the
paper
before
him
on
the
table
and
marjorie
looking
past
her
mother
saw
that
his
hands
shook
as
he
spread
it
nelson
began
the
priest
reading
aloud
with
some
difficulty
brought
before
my
lords
and
first
had
tendered
to
him
the
oath
of
the
queen
supremacy
this
he
refused
to
take
saying
that
no
lay
prince
could
have
over
christ
church
and
upon
being
pressed
as
to
who
then
could
have
it
answered
christ
vicar
only
the
successor
of
peter
further
he
proceeded
to
say
under
questioning
that
since
the
religion
of
england
at
this
time
is
schismatic
and
heretical
so
also
is
the
queen
grace
who
is
head
of
it
then
was
what
was
wanted
and
after
a
delay
of
a
few
weeks
the
same
questions
being
put
to
him
and
his
answers
being
the
same
he
was
sentenced
to
death
he
was
very
fortunate
in
his
imprisonment
i
had
speech
with
him
two
or
three
times
and
was
the
means
by
god
blessing
of
bringing
another
priest
to
him
to
whom
he
confessed
himself
and
with
whom
he
received
the
body
of
christ
a
day
before
he
suffered
the
third
of
february
knowing
nothing
of
his
death
being
so
near
he
was
brought
up
to
a
higher
part
of
the
prison
and
there
told
he
was
to
suffer
that
day
his
kinsmen
were
admitted
to
him
then
to
bid
him
farewell
and
afterwards
two
ministers
came
to
turn
him
from
his
faith
if
they
could
but
they
prevailed
nothing
there
was
a
pause
in
the
reading
but
there
was
no
movement
among
any
that
listened
robin
watching
from
his
place
at
the
table
cold
at
heart
ran
his
eyes
along
the
faces
the
priest
was
as
white
as
death
with
the
excitement
it
seemed
of
having
to
tell
such
a
tale
his
host
beside
him
seemed
downcast
and
quiet
but
perfectly
composed
mrs
manners
had
her
eyes
closed
anthony
babington
was
frowning
to
himself
with
tight
lips
marjorie
he
could
not
see
with
a
great
effort
the
reader
resumed
he
was
laid
on
the
hurdle
he
refused
to
ask
pardon
of
the
grace
for
said
he
i
have
never
yet
offended
her
i
was
beside
him
and
heard
it
and
he
added
when
those
who
stood
near
stormed
at
him
that
it
was
better
to
be
hanged
than
to
burn
in
was
a
great
concourse
of
people
at
tyburn
but
kept
back
by
the
officers
so
that
they
could
not
come
at
him
when
he
was
in
the
cart
first
he
commended
his
spirit
into
god
hands
saying
manus
etc
then
he
besought
all
catholics
that
were
present
to
pray
for
him
i
saw
a
good
many
who
signed
themselves
in
the
crowd
and
then
he
said
some
prayers
in
latin
with
the
psalms
and
and
then
he
addressed
himself
to
the
people
telling
them
he
died
for
his
religion
which
was
the
catholic
roman
one
and
prayed
and
desired
them
to
pray
that
god
would
bring
all
englishmen
into
it
the
crowd
cried
out
at
that
exclaiming
against
this
romish
and
so
he
said
what
he
had
to
say
over
again
then
before
the
cart
was
drawn
away
from
him
to
leave
him
to
hang
he
asked
pardon
of
all
them
he
had
offended
and
even
of
the
queen
if
he
had
indeed
offended
her
then
one
of
the
sheriffs
called
on
the
hangman
to
make
an
end
so
nelson
prayed
again
in
silence
and
then
begged
all
catholics
that
were
there
once
more
to
pray
that
by
the
bitter
passion
of
christ
his
soul
might
be
received
into
everlasting
joy
and
they
did
so
for
as
the
cart
was
drawn
away
a
great
number
cried
out
and
i
with
them
receive
his
was
cut
down
according
to
sentence
before
he
was
dead
and
the
butchery
begun
on
him
and
when
it
was
near
over
he
moved
a
little
in
his
pain
and
said
that
he
forgave
the
queen
and
all
that
caused
or
consented
to
his
death
and
so
he
died
the
priest
voice
which
had
shaken
again
and
again
grew
so
tremulous
as
he
ended
that
those
that
were
at
the
end
of
the
hall
could
scarcely
hear
him
and
as
it
ceased
a
murmur
ran
along
the
seats
fitzherbert
leaned
over
to
the
priest
and
whispered
the
priest
nodded
and
the
other
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
there
is
more
yet
he
said
simpson
with
a
hand
that
still
shook
so
violently
that
he
could
hardly
hold
his
glass
lifted
and
drank
off
a
cup
of
muscadel
then
he
cleared
his
throat
sat
up
a
little
in
his
chair
and
resumed
i
went
to
see
sherwood
to
talk
to
him
in
prison
and
to
encourage
him
by
telling
him
of
the
passion
of
the
other
and
how
bravely
he
bore
it
sherwood
took
it
very
well
and
said
that
he
was
afraid
of
nothing
that
he
had
reconciled
his
mind
to
it
long
ago
and
had
rehearsed
it
all
two
or
three
times
so
that
he
would
know
what
to
say
and
how
to
bear
himself
fitzherbert
leaned
over
again
to
the
priest
at
this
point
and
whispered
something
simpson
nodded
and
raised
his
eyes
sherwood
he
said
was
a
scholar
from
douay
but
not
a
priest
he
was
lodging
in
the
house
of
a
catholic
lady
and
had
procured
mass
to
be
said
there
and
it
was
through
her
son
that
he
was
taken
and
charged
with
recusancy
again
ran
a
rustle
through
the
benches
this
executing
of
the
laity
for
religion
was
a
new
thing
in
their
experience
the
priest
lifted
the
paper
again
found
that
sherwood
had
been
racked
many
times
in
the
tower
during
the
six
months
he
was
in
prison
to
force
him
to
tell
if
they
could
where
he
had
heard
mass
and
who
had
said
it
but
they
could
prevail
nothing
further
no
visitor
was
admitted
to
him
all
this
time
and
i
was
the
first
and
the
last
that
he
had
and
that
though
roper
himself
had
tried
to
get
at
him
for
his
relief
for
he
was
confined
underground
and
lay
in
chains
and
filth
not
to
be
described
i
said
what
i
could
to
him
but
he
said
he
needed
nothing
and
was
content
though
his
pain
must
have
been
very
great
all
this
while
what
with
the
racking
repeated
over
and
over
again
and
the
place
he
lay
in
was
present
again
when
he
suffered
at
tyburn
but
was
too
far
away
to
hear
anything
that
he
said
and
scarcely
indeed
could
see
him
but
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
died
well
and
courageously
as
a
catholic
should
and
made
no
outcry
or
complaint
when
the
butchery
was
done
on
him
then
is
the
news
i
have
to
send
you
sorrowful
indeed
yet
joyful
too
for
surely
we
may
think
that
they
who
bore
such
pains
for
christ
sake
with
such
constancy
will
intercede
for
us
whom
they
leave
behind
i
am
hoping
myself
to
come
north
again
before
i
go
to
douay
next
year
and
will
see
you
then
and
tell
you
more
the
priest
laid
down
the
paper
trembling
fitzherbert
looked
up
it
will
give
pleasure
to
the
company
he
said
to
know
that
the
writer
of
the
letter
is
ludlam
from
radbourne
in
this
county
as
you
have
heard
he
too
hopes
by
god
mercy
to
be
made
priest
and
to
come
back
to
england
chapter
viii
i
in
the
following
week
robin
went
home
again
the
clear
weather
of
easter
had
broken
and
racing
clouds
thick
as
a
pall
sped
across
the
sky
that
had
been
so
blue
and
so
cheerful
a
wind
screamed
all
day
now
high
now
low
shattering
the
tender
flowers
of
spring
ruffling
the
derwent
against
its
current
by
which
he
rode
and
dashing
spatters
of
rain
now
and
again
on
his
back
tossing
high
and
wide
the
branches
under
which
he
went
until
the
woods
themselves
became
as
a
great
melancholy
organ
making
sad
music
about
him
when
a
mind
is
fluent
and
uncertain
there
is
no
describing
it
he
thought
he
had
come
to
a
decision
last
week
he
found
that
the
decision
was
shattered
as
soon
as
made
he
had
talked
to
the
priest
he
had
resisted
marjorie
and
yet
to
neither
of
them
had
he
put
into
formal
words
what
it
was
that
troubled
him
he
had
asked
questions
about
vocation
about
the
place
that
circumstance
occupies
in
it
of
the
value
of
dispositions
fears
scruples
and
resistance
he
had
that
is
fingered
his
wound
half
uncovered
it
and
then
covered
it
up
again
tormented
it
glanced
at
it
and
then
glanced
aside
yet
the
one
thing
he
had
not
done
was
to
probe
it
not
even
to
allow
another
to
do
so
his
mind
then
was
fluent
and
distracted
it
formed
images
before
him
which
dissolved
as
soon
as
formed
it
whirled
in
little
eddies
it
threw
up
obscuring
foam
it
ran
clear
one
instant
and
the
next
broke
itself
in
rapids
he
could
neither
ease
it
nor
dam
it
altogether
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
as
he
rode
through
froggatt
he
saw
a
group
of
standing
at
the
inn
door
but
thought
nothing
of
it
till
a
man
ran
out
of
the
door
still
holding
his
pot
and
saluted
him
and
he
recognised
him
to
be
one
of
babington
men
my
master
is
within
sir
he
said
he
bade
me
look
out
for
you
robin
drew
rein
and
as
he
did
so
anthony
too
came
out
ah
he
said
i
heard
you
would
be
coming
this
way
will
you
come
in
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
robin
slipped
off
leaving
his
mare
in
the
hands
of
anthony
man
since
he
himself
was
riding
alone
with
his
valise
strapped
on
behind
it
was
a
little
room
very
trim
and
well
kept
on
the
first
floor
to
which
his
friend
led
him
anthony
shut
the
door
carefully
and
came
across
to
the
settle
by
the
well
he
said
i
have
bad
news
for
you
my
friend
will
you
forgive
me
i
have
seen
your
father
and
had
words
with
him
eh
i
said
nothing
to
you
before
went
on
the
other
sitting
down
beside
him
i
knew
you
would
not
have
it
so
but
i
went
to
see
for
myself
and
to
put
a
question
or
two
he
is
your
father
but
he
has
also
been
my
friend
that
gives
me
rights
you
see
tell
me
said
robin
heavily
it
appeared
that
anthony
who
was
a
precise
as
well
as
an
ardent
young
man
had
had
scruples
about
trusting
to
hearsay
certainly
it
was
rumoured
far
and
wide
that
the
squire
of
matstead
had
done
as
he
had
said
he
would
do
and
gone
to
church
but
anthony
was
one
of
those
spirits
who
will
always
have
things
as
they
say
from
the
partly
from
instincts
of
justice
partly
no
doubt
for
the
pleasure
of
making
direct
observations
to
the
principals
concerned
this
was
what
he
had
done
in
this
case
he
had
ridden
without
a
word
to
any
up
to
matstead
and
had
demanded
to
be
led
to
the
squire
and
there
and
then
refusing
to
sit
down
till
he
was
answered
had
put
his
question
there
had
been
a
scene
the
squire
had
referred
to
puppies
who
wanted
drowning
to
young
sparks
and
to
such
illustrative
similes
and
anthony
in
spite
of
his
youthful
years
had
flared
out
about
turncoats
and
there
had
been
a
very
pretty
ending
the
squire
had
shouted
for
his
servants
and
anthony
for
his
and
the
two
parties
had
eyed
one
another
growling
like
dogs
until
bloodshed
seemed
imminent
then
the
visitor
had
himself
solved
the
situation
by
stalking
out
of
the
house
from
which
the
squire
was
proposing
to
flog
him
mounting
his
horse
and
with
a
last
compliment
or
two
had
ridden
away
and
here
he
was
at
froggatt
on
his
return
journey
having
eaten
there
that
dinner
which
no
longer
would
be
spread
for
him
at
matstead
robin
sat
silent
till
the
tale
was
done
and
at
the
end
of
it
anthony
was
striding
about
the
room
aflame
again
with
wrath
gesticulating
and
raging
aloud
then
robin
spoke
holding
up
his
hand
for
moderation
you
will
have
the
whole
house
here
he
said
well
you
have
cooked
my
goose
for
me
bah
that
was
cooked
at
passiontide
when
you
went
to
booth
edge
do
you
think
he
ever
have
a
papist
in
his
house
again
did
he
say
so
no
but
he
said
enough
about
his
nonsense
man
come
home
with
me
to
dethick
we
find
occupation
enough
did
he
say
he
would
not
have
me
home
again
no
bawled
anthony
i
have
told
you
he
did
not
say
so
outright
but
he
said
enough
to
show
he
have
no
rebels
as
he
called
them
in
his
protestant
house
dick
to
leave
did
you
hear
that
dick
why
certainly
there
was
a
on
sunday
and
dick
spoke
his
mind
he
come
to
me
he
says
if
you
have
no
service
for
him
robin
set
his
teeth
it
seemed
as
if
the
pelting
blows
would
never
cease
come
with
me
to
dethick
said
anthony
again
i
tell
you
well
there
be
time
enough
to
tell
you
when
you
come
but
i
promise
you
occupation
enough
he
paused
as
if
he
would
say
more
and
dared
not
you
must
tell
me
more
said
the
lad
slowly
what
kind
of
occupation
then
anthony
did
a
queer
thing
he
first
glanced
at
the
door
and
then
went
to
it
quickly
and
threw
it
open
the
little
lobby
was
empty
he
went
out
leaned
over
the
stair
and
called
one
of
his
men
sit
you
there
he
said
with
the
glorious
nonchalance
of
a
babington
and
let
no
man
by
till
i
tell
you
he
came
back
closed
the
door
bolted
it
and
then
came
across
and
sat
down
by
his
friend
do
you
think
the
rest
of
us
are
doing
nothing
he
whispered
why
i
tell
you
that
a
dozen
of
us
in
derbyshire
he
broke
off
once
more
i
may
not
tell
you
he
said
i
must
ask
leave
first
a
light
began
to
glimmer
before
robin
mind
the
light
broadened
suddenly
and
intensely
and
his
whole
soul
leapt
to
meet
it
do
you
mean
and
then
he
too
broke
off
well
knowing
enough
though
not
all
of
what
was
meant
it
was
quiet
here
within
this
room
in
spite
of
the
village
street
outside
it
was
and
all
were
within
doors
or
out
at
their
affairs
and
except
for
the
stamp
of
a
horse
now
and
again
and
the
scream
of
the
wind
in
the
keyhole
and
between
the
windows
there
was
little
to
hear
and
in
the
lad
soul
was
a
tempest
he
knew
well
enough
now
what
his
friend
meant
though
nothing
of
the
details
and
from
the
secrecy
and
excitement
of
the
young
man
manner
he
understood
what
the
character
of
his
dealings
would
likely
be
and
towards
those
dealings
his
whole
nature
leaped
as
a
fish
to
the
water
was
it
possible
that
this
way
lay
the
escape
from
his
own
torment
of
conscience
yet
he
must
put
a
question
first
in
honesty
tell
me
this
much
he
said
in
a
low
voice
do
you
mean
that
this
this
affair
will
be
against
men
lives
or
or
such
as
even
a
priest
might
engage
in
then
the
light
of
fanaticism
leaped
to
the
eyes
of
his
friend
and
his
face
brightened
wonderfully
do
they
observe
the
courtesies
and
forms
of
law
he
snarled
did
nelson
die
by
god
law
or
did
sherwood
those
we
know
of
i
will
tell
you
this
he
said
and
no
more
unless
you
pledge
yourself
to
us
that
we
count
it
as
warfare
in
christ
name
yes
but
warfare
for
all
that
there
then
lay
the
choice
before
this
lad
and
surely
it
was
as
hard
a
choice
as
ever
a
man
had
to
make
on
the
one
side
lay
such
an
excitement
as
he
had
never
yet
known
for
anthony
was
no
merely
mad
fool
a
path
too
that
gave
him
hopes
of
marjorie
that
gave
him
an
escape
from
home
without
any
more
ado
a
task
besides
which
he
could
tell
himself
honestly
was
at
least
for
the
cause
that
lay
so
near
to
heart
and
was
beginning
to
lie
near
his
own
and
on
the
other
there
was
open
to
him
that
against
which
he
had
fought
now
day
after
day
in
misery
a
life
that
had
no
single
attraction
to
the
natural
man
in
him
a
life
that
meant
the
loss
of
marjorie
for
ever
the
colour
died
from
his
lips
as
he
considered
this
surely
all
lay
anthony
way
anthony
was
a
gentleman
like
himself
he
would
do
nothing
that
was
not
worthy
of
one
what
he
had
said
of
warfare
was
surely
sound
logic
were
they
not
already
at
war
had
not
the
queen
declared
it
and
on
the
other
side
nothing
nothing
except
that
a
voice
within
him
on
that
other
side
cried
louder
and
louder
it
seemed
in
despair
this
is
the
way
walk
in
it
come
whispered
anthony
again
robin
stood
up
he
made
as
if
to
speak
then
he
silenced
himself
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
little
room
he
could
hear
voices
from
the
room
beneath
anthony
men
talking
there
no
doubt
they
might
be
his
men
too
at
the
lifting
of
a
finger
they
and
dick
there
were
the
horses
waiting
without
he
heard
the
jingle
of
a
bit
as
one
tossed
his
head
those
were
the
horses
that
would
go
back
to
dethick
and
derby
and
may
be
half
over
england
he
walked
to
and
fro
half
a
dozen
times
without
speaking
and
if
he
had
but
guessed
it
he
might
have
been
comforted
to
know
that
his
manhood
flowed
in
upon
him
as
a
tide
coming
in
over
a
flat
beach
these
instants
added
more
years
to
him
than
as
many
months
that
had
gone
before
his
boyhood
was
passing
since
experience
and
conflict
whether
it
end
in
victory
or
defeat
give
the
years
to
a
man
far
more
than
the
passing
of
time
so
in
god
sight
robin
added
many
inches
to
the
stature
of
his
spirit
in
this
little
parlour
of
froggatt
yet
though
he
conquered
then
he
did
not
know
that
he
conquered
he
still
believed
as
he
turned
at
last
and
faced
his
friend
that
his
mind
was
yet
to
make
up
and
his
whisper
was
harsh
and
broken
i
do
not
know
he
whispered
i
must
go
home
first
ii
dick
was
waiting
by
the
porter
lodge
as
the
boy
rode
in
and
walked
up
beside
him
with
his
brown
hand
on
the
horse
shoulder
robin
could
not
say
much
and
besides
his
confidence
must
be
tied
so
you
are
going
he
said
softly
the
man
nodded
i
met
babington
you
can
not
do
better
i
think
than
go
to
him
it
was
with
a
miserable
heart
that
an
hour
or
two
later
he
came
down
to
supper
his
father
was
already
at
table
sitting
grimly
in
his
place
he
made
no
sign
of
welcome
or
recognition
as
his
son
came
in
during
the
meal
itself
this
was
of
no
great
consequence
as
silence
was
the
custom
but
the
boy
heart
sank
yet
further
as
still
without
a
word
to
him
the
squire
rose
from
table
at
the
end
and
went
as
usual
through
the
parlour
door
he
hesitated
a
moment
before
following
then
he
grasped
his
courage
and
went
after
all
things
were
as
usual
there
the
wine
set
out
and
the
sweetmeats
and
his
father
in
his
usual
place
yet
still
there
was
silence
robin
began
to
meditate
again
yet
alert
for
a
sign
or
a
word
it
was
in
this
little
room
he
understood
that
the
dispute
with
anthony
had
taken
place
a
few
hours
before
and
he
looked
round
it
almost
wondering
that
all
seemed
so
peaceful
it
was
this
room
too
that
was
associated
with
so
much
that
was
happy
in
his
life
hours
after
supper
when
his
father
was
in
genial
moods
or
when
company
was
there
company
that
would
never
come
again
and
laughter
and
gallant
talk
went
round
there
was
the
fire
burning
in
the
new
stove
that
which
had
so
much
excited
him
only
a
year
or
two
ago
for
it
was
then
the
first
that
he
had
ever
seen
there
was
the
table
where
he
had
written
his
little
letter
there
was
christ
carrying
his
cross
so
you
have
sent
your
friend
to
insult
me
now
robin
started
the
voice
was
quiet
enough
but
full
of
a
suppressed
force
i
have
not
sir
i
met
babington
at
froggatt
on
his
way
back
he
told
me
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
and
you
talked
with
him
at
padley
too
no
doubt
yes
sir
his
father
suddenly
wheeled
round
on
him
do
you
think
i
have
no
sense
then
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
what
you
and
your
friends
speak
of
robin
was
silent
he
was
astonished
how
little
afraid
he
was
his
heart
beat
loud
enough
in
his
ears
yet
he
felt
none
of
that
helplessness
that
had
fallen
on
him
before
when
his
father
was
angry
certainly
he
had
added
to
his
stature
in
the
parlour
at
froggatt
the
old
man
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
drank
it
his
face
was
flushed
high
and
he
was
using
more
words
than
usual
well
sir
there
are
other
affairs
we
must
speak
of
and
then
no
more
of
them
i
wish
to
know
your
meaning
for
the
time
to
come
there
must
be
no
more
fooling
this
way
and
that
i
shall
pay
no
fines
for
you
mark
that
if
you
must
stand
on
your
own
feet
stand
on
them
now
then
do
you
mean
am
i
coming
to
church
with
you
sir
i
mean
who
is
to
pay
your
fines
miss
marjorie
robin
set
his
teeth
at
the
sneer
i
have
not
yet
been
fined
sir
now
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
think
they
let
you
off
i
was
speaking
the
old
man
stopped
yes
sir
the
other
wheeled
his
face
on
him
if
you
will
have
it
he
said
i
was
speaking
to
my
two
good
friends
who
dined
here
on
sunday
i
was
plain
with
them
and
they
were
plain
with
me
shall
not
pay
for
my
brat
of
a
son
i
said
he
must
pay
for
himself
said
they
we
lay
him
by
the
heels
in
my
house
i
hope
i
said
and
they
laughed
at
that
we
were
very
merry
together
yes
sir
good
god
have
i
a
fool
for
a
son
i
ask
you
again
who
is
it
to
pay
when
will
they
demand
it
why
they
may
demand
it
next
week
if
they
will
you
were
not
at
church
on
sunday
i
was
not
in
matstead
said
the
lad
but
and
barton
will
not
i
think
the
old
man
struck
the
table
suddenly
and
violently
i
have
dropped
words
enough
he
cried
where
the
use
of
it
if
you
think
they
will
let
you
alone
i
tell
you
they
will
not
there
are
to
be
doings
before
christmas
at
latest
and
what
then
then
robin
drew
his
breath
sharply
between
his
teeth
and
knew
that
one
more
step
had
been
passed
that
had
separated
him
from
that
which
he
feared
he
had
come
just
now
still
hesitating
still
there
had
been
passing
through
his
mind
hopes
and
ideas
of
what
his
father
might
do
for
him
he
knew
well
enough
that
he
would
never
pay
the
fines
amounting
sometimes
to
as
much
as
twenty
pounds
a
month
but
he
had
thought
that
perhaps
his
father
would
give
him
a
sum
of
money
and
let
him
go
to
fend
for
himself
that
he
might
help
him
even
to
a
situation
somewhere
and
now
hope
had
died
so
utterly
that
he
did
not
even
dare
speak
of
it
and
he
had
said
no
to
anthony
he
said
to
himself
at
least
that
he
had
meant
no
in
spite
of
his
hesitation
all
doors
seemed
closing
save
that
which
terrified
him
i
have
thought
in
my
mind
he
began
and
stopped
for
the
terror
of
what
was
on
his
tongue
grew
suddenly
upon
him
eh
robin
stood
up
i
must
have
time
sir
he
cried
i
must
have
time
do
not
press
me
too
much
his
father
eyes
shone
bright
and
wrathful
he
beat
on
the
table
with
his
open
hand
but
the
boy
was
too
quick
for
him
i
beg
of
you
sir
not
to
make
me
speak
too
soon
it
may
be
that
you
would
hate
that
i
should
speak
more
than
my
silence
his
whole
person
was
tense
and
magnetic
his
face
was
paler
than
ever
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
father
understood
enough
at
least
to
make
him
hesitate
the
two
looked
at
one
another
and
it
was
the
man
eyes
that
tell
first
you
may
have
till
pentecost
he
said
iii
it
would
be
at
about
an
hour
before
dawn
that
robin
awoke
for
perhaps
the
third
or
fourth
time
that
night
for
the
conflict
still
roared
within
his
soul
and
would
give
him
no
peace
and
as
he
lay
there
awake
in
an
instant
staring
up
into
the
dark
once
more
weighing
and
balancing
this
and
the
other
swayed
by
enthusiasm
at
one
moment
weighed
down
with
melancholy
the
next
there
came
to
him
distinct
and
clear
through
the
still
night
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
perhaps
of
three
or
four
beasts
walking
together
now
whether
it
was
the
ferment
of
his
own
soul
or
the
work
of
some
interior
influence
or
indeed
the
very
intimation
of
god
himself
robin
never
knew
though
he
inclined
later
to
the
last
of
these
yet
it
remains
as
a
fact
that
when
he
heard
that
sound
so
fierce
was
his
curiosity
to
know
who
it
was
that
rode
abroad
in
company
at
such
an
hour
he
threw
off
the
blankets
that
covered
him
went
to
his
window
and
threw
it
open
further
when
he
had
listened
there
a
second
or
two
and
had
heard
the
sound
cease
and
then
break
out
again
clearer
and
nearer
signifying
that
the
party
was
riding
through
the
village
his
curiosity
grew
so
intense
that
he
turned
from
the
window
snatched
up
and
put
on
a
few
clothes
groping
for
them
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
dimness
and
was
presently
speeding
barefooted
downstairs
telling
himself
in
one
breath
that
he
was
a
fool
and
in
the
next
that
he
must
reach
the
churchyard
wall
before
the
horses
did
it
was
but
a
short
run
when
he
had
come
down
into
the
court
by
the
little
staircase
that
led
from
the
men
rooms
the
ground
was
soaking
with
the
rains
of
yesterday
but
he
cared
nothing
for
that
and
as
the
riding
party
turned
up
the
little
ascent
that
led
beneath
the
churchyard
robin
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
was
keeping
between
the
tombstones
to
see
and
not
be
seen
it
was
within
an
hour
of
dawn
at
that
time
when
the
sky
begins
to
glimmer
with
rifts
above
the
two
horizons
showing
light
enough
at
least
to
distinguish
faces
it
was
such
a
light
as
that
in
which
he
had
seen
the
deer
looking
at
him
motionless
as
he
rode
home
with
dick
yet
the
three
who
now
rode
up
towards
him
were
so
muffled
about
the
faces
that
he
feared
he
would
not
know
them
they
were
men
all
three
of
them
and
he
could
make
out
valises
strapped
to
the
saddle
of
each
but
what
seemed
strange
they
did
not
speak
as
they
came
and
it
appeared
as
if
they
wished
to
make
no
more
noise
than
was
necessary
since
one
of
them
when
his
horse
set
his
foot
upon
the
cobblestones
beside
the
pulled
him
sharply
off
them
and
then
just
as
they
rounded
the
angle
of
the
wall
where
the
boy
crouched
peeping
the
man
that
rode
in
the
middle
sighed
as
if
with
relief
and
pulled
the
cloak
that
was
about
him
so
that
the
collar
fell
from
his
face
and
at
the
same
time
turned
to
his
companion
on
his
right
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
but
the
boy
heard
not
a
word
for
he
found
himself
staring
at
the
young
priest
from
whom
he
had
received
holy
communion
at
padley
it
was
but
for
an
instant
for
the
man
to
whom
the
priest
spoke
answered
in
the
same
low
voice
and
the
other
pulled
his
cloak
again
round
his
mouth
yet
the
look
was
enough
the
sight
once
more
of
this
servant
of
god
setting
out
again
upon
his
perilous
travels
seen
at
such
a
moment
when
the
boy
judgment
hung
in
the
balance
as
he
thought
this
one
single
reminder
of
what
a
priest
could
do
in
these
days
of
sorrow
and
of
what
god
called
on
him
to
do
the
vision
for
it
was
scarcely
less
all
things
considered
of
a
life
such
as
this
presented
so
to
say
in
this
single
scene
of
a
furtive
and
secret
ride
before
the
dawn
leaving
padley
soon
after
midnight
this
falling
on
a
soul
that
already
leaned
that
way
finished
that
for
which
marjorie
had
prayed
and
against
which
the
lad
himself
had
fought
so
fiercely
half
an
hour
later
he
stood
by
his
father
bed
looking
down
on
him
without
fear
father
he
said
as
the
old
man
stared
up
at
him
through
eyes
i
have
come
to
give
you
my
answer
it
is
that
i
must
go
to
rheims
and
be
a
priest
then
he
turned
again
and
went
out
of
the
room
without
waiting
chapter
ix
i
mrs
manners
was
still
abed
when
her
daughter
came
in
to
see
her
she
lay
in
the
great
chamber
that
gave
upon
the
gallery
above
the
hall
whence
on
either
side
she
could
hear
whether
or
no
the
maids
were
at
their
business
which
was
a
comfort
to
her
if
a
discomfort
to
them
and
now
that
her
lord
was
in
derby
she
lay
here
all
alone
the
first
that
she
knew
of
her
daughter
coming
was
a
light
in
her
eyes
and
the
next
was
a
face
as
of
a
stranger
looking
at
her
with
great
eyes
exalted
by
joy
and
pain
the
light
held
below
cast
shadows
upwards
from
chin
and
cheek
and
the
eyes
shone
in
hollows
then
as
she
sat
up
she
saw
that
it
was
her
daughter
and
that
the
maid
held
a
paper
in
her
hands
she
was
in
her
and
a
wrap
lay
over
her
shoulders
and
shrouded
her
hair
he
is
to
be
a
priest
she
whispered
sharply
thank
our
lord
with
me
and
and
god
have
mercy
on
me
then
marjorie
was
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
sobbing
so
that
the
curtains
shook
the
mother
got
it
all
out
of
her
presently
the
tale
of
the
girl
heart
torn
two
ways
at
once
on
the
one
side
there
was
her
human
love
for
the
lad
who
had
wooed
her
as
hot
as
fire
and
as
pure
and
on
the
other
that
keen
romance
that
had
made
her
pray
that
he
might
be
a
priest
this
second
desire
had
come
to
her
as
sharp
as
a
voice
that
calls
when
she
had
heard
of
the
apostasy
of
his
father
it
had
seemed
to
her
the
riposte
that
god
made
to
the
assault
upon
his
honour
the
father
would
no
longer
be
his
worshipper
then
let
the
son
be
his
priest
and
so
the
balance
be
restored
and
so
the
maid
had
striven
with
the
two
loves
that
for
once
would
not
agree
together
as
did
the
man
in
the
gospels
who
wished
to
go
and
bury
his
father
and
afterwards
to
follow
his
saviour
she
had
not
dared
to
say
a
word
to
the
lad
of
anything
of
this
lest
it
should
be
her
will
and
not
god
that
should
govern
him
for
she
knew
very
well
what
a
power
she
had
over
him
but
she
had
prayed
god
and
begged
robin
to
pray
too
and
to
listen
to
his
voice
and
now
she
had
her
way
and
her
heart
was
broken
with
it
she
said
and
when
i
think
she
wailed
across
her
mother
knees
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
priest
and
of
the
life
that
he
will
lead
and
of
the
death
that
he
may
die
and
it
is
i
i
who
will
have
sent
him
to
it
mother
mrs
manners
was
bethinking
herself
of
a
cordial
just
then
and
how
she
knew
old
ann
would
be
coming
presently
and
was
listening
with
but
half
an
ear
it
not
you
my
dear
she
said
patting
the
head
beneath
her
hands
the
wrap
was
fallen
off
and
the
maid
long
hair
was
all
over
her
shoulders
and
now
but
our
lord
will
take
care
of
him
will
he
not
and
not
suffer
mrs
manners
fell
to
patting
her
head
again
and
who
brought
the
message
she
asked
mrs
manners
was
one
of
those
experienced
persons
who
are
fully
persuaded
that
youth
is
a
disease
that
must
be
borne
with
patiently
time
indeed
will
cure
it
yet
until
the
cure
is
complete
elders
must
bear
it
as
well
as
they
can
and
not
seem
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
it
a
rigorous
and
prudent
diet
long
hours
of
sleep
plenty
of
occupation
these
are
the
remedies
for
the
fever
so
while
marjorie
first
began
to
read
the
lad
letter
and
then
breaking
down
altogether
thrust
it
into
her
mother
hand
mrs
manners
was
searching
her
memory
as
to
whether
any
imprudence
the
day
before
in
food
or
behaviour
could
be
the
cause
of
this
crisis
love
between
boys
and
girls
was
common
enough
she
herself
twenty
years
ago
had
suffered
from
the
sickness
when
young
john
had
come
wooing
her
yet
a
love
that
could
thrust
from
it
that
which
it
loved
was
beyond
her
altogether
either
marjorie
loved
the
lad
or
she
did
not
and
if
she
loved
him
why
did
she
pray
that
he
might
be
a
priest
that
was
foolishness
since
priesthood
was
a
bar
to
marriage
she
began
to
conclude
that
marjorie
did
not
love
him
it
had
been
but
a
romantic
fancy
and
she
was
encouraged
by
the
thought
madge
she
began
when
she
had
read
through
the
confused
line
or
two
in
the
hand
of
robin
scribbled
and
dispatched
by
the
hands
of
dick
scarcely
two
hours
ago
madge
she
was
about
to
say
something
sensible
when
the
maid
interrupted
her
again
and
it
is
i
who
have
brought
it
all
on
him
she
wailed
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
her
mother
laid
a
firm
hand
on
her
daughter
mouth
it
was
not
often
that
she
felt
the
superior
of
the
two
yet
here
was
a
time
plain
enough
when
maturity
and
experience
must
take
the
reins
madge
she
said
it
is
plain
you
do
not
love
him
or
you
never
the
maid
started
back
her
eyes
ablaze
not
love
him
why
that
you
do
not
love
him
truly
or
you
would
never
have
wished
this
for
him
now
listen
to
me
she
raised
an
admonitory
finger
complacent
at
last
but
her
speech
was
not
to
be
made
at
that
time
for
her
daughter
swiftly
rose
to
her
feet
controlled
at
last
by
the
shock
of
astonishment
then
i
do
not
think
you
know
what
love
is
she
said
softly
to
love
is
to
wish
the
other
highest
good
as
i
understand
it
mrs
manners
compressed
her
lips
as
might
a
prophetess
before
a
prediction
but
her
daughter
was
beforehand
with
her
again
that
is
the
love
of
a
christian
at
least
she
said
then
she
stooped
took
the
letter
from
her
mother
knees
and
went
out
mrs
manners
sat
for
a
moment
as
her
daughter
left
her
then
she
understood
that
her
hour
of
superiority
was
gone
with
marjorie
hour
of
weakness
and
she
emitted
a
short
laugh
as
she
took
her
place
again
behind
the
child
she
had
borne
ii
it
was
a
strange
time
that
marjorie
had
until
two
days
later
when
robin
came
and
told
her
all
and
how
it
had
fallen
out
for
now
it
seemed
she
walked
on
air
now
in
shoes
of
lead
when
she
was
at
her
prayers
which
was
pretty
often
just
now
and
at
other
times
when
the
air
lightened
suddenly
about
her
and
the
burdens
of
earth
were
lifted
as
if
another
hand
were
put
to
them
at
those
times
which
every
interior
soul
experiences
in
a
period
of
stress
why
then
all
was
glory
and
she
saw
robin
as
transfigured
and
herself
beneath
him
all
but
adoring
little
visions
came
and
went
before
her
imagination
robin
riding
like
some
knight
on
an
adventure
to
do
christ
work
robin
at
the
altar
in
his
vestments
robin
absolving
penitents
all
in
a
rosy
light
of
faith
and
romance
she
saw
him
even
on
the
scaffold
undaunted
and
resolute
with
god
light
on
his
face
and
the
crowd
awed
beneath
him
she
saw
his
soul
entering
heaven
with
all
the
harps
ringing
to
meet
him
and
eternity
begun
and
then
at
other
times
when
the
heaviness
came
down
on
her
as
clouds
upon
the
derbyshire
hills
she
understood
nothing
but
that
she
had
lost
him
that
he
was
not
to
be
hers
but
another
that
a
loveless
and
empty
life
lay
before
her
and
a
womanhood
that
was
without
its
fruition
and
it
was
this
latter
mood
that
fell
on
her
swift
and
entire
when
looking
out
from
her
window
a
little
before
she
saw
suddenly
his
hat
and
cecily
head
jerking
up
the
steep
path
that
led
to
the
house
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
her
bedside
jesu
she
cried
jesu
give
me
strength
to
meet
him
mrs
manners
too
hearing
the
horse
footsteps
on
the
pavement
a
minute
later
and
marjorie
steps
going
downstairs
also
looked
forth
and
saw
him
dismounting
she
was
a
prudent
woman
and
did
not
stir
a
finger
till
she
heard
the
bell
ringing
in
the
court
for
the
dinner
to
be
served
they
would
have
time
so
she
thought
to
arrange
their
attitudes
and
indeed
she
was
right
for
it
was
two
quiet
enough
persons
who
met
her
as
she
came
down
into
the
hall
robin
flushed
with
riding
yet
wholly
under
his
own
command
and
resolute
and
natural
indeed
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
more
of
a
man
than
she
had
thought
him
and
her
daughter
too
was
still
and
strong
a
trifle
paler
than
she
should
be
yet
that
was
to
be
expected
at
dinner
of
course
nothing
could
be
spoken
of
but
the
most
ordinary
affairs
in
such
speaking
that
is
as
there
was
it
was
not
till
they
had
gone
out
into
the
walled
garden
and
sat
them
down
all
three
of
them
on
the
long
beside
the
that
a
word
was
said
on
these
new
matters
there
was
silence
as
they
walked
there
and
silence
as
they
sat
down
tell
her
robin
said
the
maid
it
appeared
that
matters
were
not
yet
as
wholly
decided
as
mrs
manners
had
thought
indeed
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
were
not
decided
at
all
robin
had
written
to
allen
and
had
found
means
to
convey
his
letter
to
simpson
who
in
his
turn
had
undertaken
to
forward
it
at
least
as
far
as
to
london
and
there
it
would
await
a
messenger
to
douay
it
might
be
a
month
before
it
would
reach
douay
and
it
might
be
three
or
four
months
or
even
more
before
an
answer
could
come
back
next
the
squire
had
taken
a
course
of
action
which
plainly
had
disconcerted
the
lad
though
it
had
its
conveniences
too
for
instead
of
increasing
the
old
man
fury
the
news
his
son
had
given
him
had
had
a
contrary
effect
he
had
seemed
all
shaken
said
robin
he
had
spoken
to
him
quietly
holding
in
the
anger
that
surely
must
be
there
the
boy
thought
without
difficulty
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
no
more
had
been
said
as
to
robin
leaving
matstead
for
the
present
not
one
word
even
about
the
fines
it
seemed
almost
as
if
the
old
man
had
been
trying
how
far
he
could
push
his
son
and
had
recoiled
when
he
had
learned
the
effect
of
his
pushing
i
think
he
is
frightened
said
the
lad
gravely
he
had
never
thought
that
i
could
be
a
priest
mrs
manners
considered
this
in
silence
and
it
may
be
autumn
before
allen
letter
comes
back
she
asked
presently
robin
said
that
that
was
so
it
may
even
be
till
winter
he
said
the
talk
among
the
priests
simpson
tells
me
is
all
about
the
removal
from
douay
it
may
be
made
at
any
time
and
who
knows
where
they
will
go
mrs
manners
glanced
across
at
her
daughter
who
sat
motionless
with
her
hands
clasped
then
she
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
reasonableness
and
sense
all
this
tragic
about
what
might
never
happen
seemed
to
her
the
height
of
folly
nay
then
she
burst
out
then
nothing
may
happen
after
all
allen
may
say
the
letter
may
never
get
to
him
it
may
be
that
you
will
forget
all
this
in
a
month
or
two
robin
turned
his
face
slowly
towards
her
and
she
saw
that
she
had
spoken
at
random
again
too
it
struck
her
attention
that
his
manner
seemed
a
little
changed
it
was
graver
than
that
to
which
she
was
accustomed
i
shall
not
forget
it
he
said
softly
and
allen
will
get
the
letter
or
if
not
he
someone
else
there
was
silence
again
but
mrs
manners
heard
her
daughter
draw
a
long
breath
iii
it
was
an
hour
later
that
marjorie
found
herself
able
to
say
that
which
she
knew
must
be
said
robin
had
lingered
on
talking
of
this
and
that
though
he
had
said
half
a
dozen
times
that
he
must
be
getting
homewards
and
at
last
when
he
rose
mistress
manners
who
was
still
wholly
misconceiving
the
situation
after
the
manner
of
sensible
folk
archly
and
tactfully
took
her
leave
and
disappeared
down
towards
the
house
advancing
some
domestic
reason
for
her
departure
robin
sighed
and
turned
to
the
girl
who
still
sat
quiet
but
as
he
turned
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
swiftly
robin
she
said
he
pulled
himself
up
you
understand
do
you
not
she
said
you
are
to
be
a
priest
you
must
remember
that
always
you
are
a
sort
of
student
already
she
could
see
him
pale
a
little
his
lips
tightened
for
a
moment
he
said
nothing
he
was
taken
wholly
aback
then
i
am
not
to
come
here
again
marjorie
stood
up
she
showed
no
sign
of
the
fierce
she
was
using
why
yes
she
said
come
as
you
would
come
to
any
catholic
neighbours
but
no
more
than
that
you
are
to
be
a
priest
the
spring
air
was
full
of
softness
and
sweetness
as
they
stood
there
on
the
trees
behind
them
and
on
the
roses
in
front
the
budding
leaves
had
burst
into
delicate
green
and
the
copses
on
all
sides
sounded
with
the
twittering
of
birds
the
whole
world
it
seemed
was
kindling
with
love
and
freshness
yet
these
two
had
to
stand
here
and
be
cold
one
to
the
other
he
was
to
be
a
priest
that
must
not
be
forgotten
and
they
must
meet
no
more
on
the
old
footing
that
was
gone
already
he
stood
among
the
levites
at
least
in
intention
and
the
lord
alone
was
to
be
the
portion
of
his
inheritance
and
his
cup
it
was
a
minute
before
either
of
them
moved
and
during
that
minute
the
maid
felt
her
courage
ebb
from
her
like
an
outgoing
tide
leaving
a
desolation
behind
it
was
all
that
she
could
do
not
to
cry
out
but
when
at
last
robin
made
a
movement
and
she
had
to
look
him
in
the
face
what
she
saw
there
braced
and
strengthened
her
you
are
right
mistress
marjorie
he
said
both
gravely
and
kindly
i
will
bid
you
and
be
getting
to
my
horse
he
kissed
her
gently
as
the
manner
was
and
went
down
the
path
alone
part
ii
chapter
i
i
it
was
with
a
sudden
leap
of
her
heart
that
marjorie
looking
out
of
her
window
at
the
late
autumn
landscape
her
mind
still
running
on
the
sheet
of
paper
that
lay
before
her
saw
a
capped
head
and
then
a
crest
rise
over
the
broken
edge
of
land
up
which
robin
had
ridden
so
often
two
and
three
years
ago
then
she
saw
who
was
the
rider
and
laid
her
pen
down
again
it
was
two
years
since
the
lad
had
gone
to
rheims
and
it
would
be
five
years
more
she
knew
since
he
was
not
over
quick
at
his
books
before
he
would
return
a
priest
she
had
letters
from
him
one
would
come
now
and
again
a
month
or
two
sometimes
after
the
date
of
writing
it
was
only
in
september
that
she
had
had
the
letter
which
he
had
written
her
on
hearing
of
her
father
death
and
mr
manners
had
died
in
june
she
had
written
back
to
him
then
a
discreet
and
modest
letter
enough
telling
him
of
how
simpson
had
read
mass
over
the
body
before
it
was
taken
down
to
derby
for
the
burying
and
telling
him
too
of
her
mother
rheumatics
that
kept
her
abed
now
three
parts
of
the
year
for
the
rest
the
letters
were
dull
enough
reading
to
one
who
did
not
understand
them
the
news
the
lad
had
to
give
was
of
a
kind
that
must
be
disguised
lest
the
letters
should
fall
into
other
hands
since
it
concerned
the
coming
and
going
of
priests
whose
names
must
not
appear
yet
for
all
that
the
letters
were
laid
up
in
a
press
and
the
heap
grew
slowly
it
was
anthony
babington
who
was
come
now
to
see
her
and
it
was
his
third
visit
since
the
summer
but
she
knew
well
enough
what
he
was
come
for
since
his
young
wife
whom
he
had
married
last
year
was
no
use
to
him
in
such
matters
she
had
lately
had
a
child
too
and
lived
quietly
at
dethick
with
her
women
his
letters
too
would
come
at
intervals
carried
by
a
rider
or
sometimes
some
farmer
man
on
his
way
home
from
derby
and
these
letters
too
held
dull
reading
enough
for
such
as
were
not
in
the
secret
yet
the
magistrates
at
derby
would
have
given
a
good
sum
if
they
could
have
intercepted
and
understood
them
it
was
in
the
upper
parlour
now
that
she
received
him
a
fire
was
burning
there
as
it
had
burned
so
long
ago
when
robin
found
her
fresh
from
her
linen
and
anthony
sat
down
in
the
same
place
she
sat
by
the
window
with
the
paper
in
her
hands
at
which
she
had
been
writing
when
she
first
saw
him
he
had
news
for
her
of
two
kinds
and
like
a
man
gave
her
first
that
which
she
least
wished
to
hear
she
had
first
showed
him
the
paper
that
was
the
very
matter
i
was
come
about
he
said
you
have
only
a
few
of
the
names
i
see
now
the
rest
will
be
over
before
christmas
and
will
all
be
in
london
together
can
you
not
give
me
the
names
she
said
i
could
give
you
the
names
certainly
and
i
will
do
so
before
i
leave
i
have
them
here
but
mistress
marjorie
could
you
not
come
to
london
with
me
it
would
ease
the
case
very
much
why
i
could
not
she
said
my
mother
and
what
good
would
it
serve
this
is
how
the
matter
stands
said
anthony
crossing
his
legs
we
have
a
dozen
priests
coming
all
together
at
least
they
will
not
travel
together
of
course
but
they
will
all
reach
london
before
christmas
and
there
they
will
hold
counsel
as
to
who
shall
go
to
the
districts
eight
of
them
i
have
no
doubt
will
come
to
the
north
there
are
as
many
priests
in
the
south
as
are
safe
at
the
present
time
or
as
are
needed
now
if
you
were
to
come
with
me
mistress
with
a
and
my
sister
would
be
with
us
we
could
meet
these
priests
and
speak
with
them
and
make
their
acquaintance
that
would
remove
a
great
deal
of
danger
we
must
not
have
that
affair
again
which
fell
out
last
month
marjorie
nodded
slowly
it
was
wonderful
how
her
gravity
had
grown
on
her
these
last
two
years
she
knew
well
enough
what
he
meant
it
was
the
affair
of
the
clerk
who
had
come
from
derby
on
a
matter
connected
with
her
father
will
about
the
time
she
was
looking
for
the
arrival
of
a
strange
priest
and
who
had
been
so
mistaken
by
her
fortunately
he
had
been
a
man
with
catholic
sympathies
or
grave
trouble
might
have
followed
but
this
proposal
of
a
visit
to
london
seemed
to
her
impossible
she
had
never
been
to
london
in
her
life
it
appeared
to
her
as
might
a
voyage
to
the
moon
derby
seemed
oppressingly
large
and
noisy
and
dangerous
and
derby
she
understood
was
scarcely
more
than
a
village
compared
to
london
i
could
not
do
it
she
said
presently
i
could
not
leave
my
mother
anthony
explained
further
it
was
evident
that
booth
edge
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
harbour
for
priests
owing
largely
to
mistress
marjorie
courage
and
piety
it
was
well
placed
it
was
remote
and
it
had
so
far
avoided
all
suspicion
padley
certainly
served
for
many
but
padley
was
nearer
the
main
road
and
besides
had
fallen
under
the
misfortune
of
losing
its
master
for
the
very
crime
of
recusancy
it
seemed
to
be
all
important
therefore
that
the
ruling
mistress
of
booth
edge
since
there
was
no
master
should
meet
as
many
priests
as
possible
in
order
that
she
might
both
know
and
be
known
by
them
and
here
was
such
an
opportunity
as
would
not
easily
occur
again
here
were
a
dozen
priests
all
to
be
together
at
one
time
and
of
these
at
least
would
be
soon
in
the
north
how
convenient
therefore
it
would
be
if
their
future
hostess
could
but
meet
them
learn
their
plans
and
perhaps
aid
them
by
her
counsel
but
she
shook
her
head
resolutely
i
can
not
do
it
she
said
anthony
made
a
little
gesture
of
resignation
but
indeed
he
had
scarcely
hoped
to
persuade
her
he
knew
it
was
a
formidable
thing
to
ask
of
a
countrybred
maid
then
we
must
do
as
well
as
we
can
he
said
in
any
case
i
must
go
there
is
a
priest
i
have
to
meet
in
any
case
he
is
returning
as
soon
as
he
has
bestowed
the
rest
yes
his
name
is
ballard
he
is
known
as
fortescue
and
passes
himself
off
as
a
captain
you
would
never
know
him
for
a
priest
he
is
returning
you
say
a
shade
of
embarrassment
passed
over
the
young
man
face
and
marjorie
saw
that
there
was
something
behind
which
she
was
not
to
know
yes
he
said
i
have
business
with
him
he
is
not
to
come
over
on
the
mission
yet
but
only
to
bring
the
others
and
see
them
safe
he
broke
off
suddenly
why
i
was
forgetting
he
cried
our
robin
is
coming
too
i
had
a
letter
from
him
and
another
for
you
he
searched
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
did
not
see
the
sudden
rigidity
that
fell
on
the
girl
for
a
moment
she
sat
perfectly
still
her
heart
had
leapt
to
her
throat
it
seemed
and
was
hammering
there
but
by
the
time
he
had
found
the
letter
she
was
herself
again
here
it
is
he
said
she
took
it
but
made
no
movement
to
open
it
but
he
is
not
to
be
a
priest
for
five
years
yet
she
said
quietly
no
but
they
send
them
sometimes
as
servants
and
such
like
to
make
a
party
seem
what
it
is
not
as
well
as
to
learn
how
to
avoid
her
servants
he
will
go
back
with
ballard
i
think
after
three
or
four
weeks
you
have
had
letters
from
him
you
told
me
she
nodded
yes
but
he
said
nothing
of
it
but
only
how
much
he
longed
to
see
england
again
he
could
not
it
has
only
just
been
arranged
he
has
asked
to
go
there
was
a
silence
for
a
moment
but
anthony
did
not
understand
what
it
meant
he
had
known
nothing
of
the
affair
of
his
friend
and
this
girl
and
he
looked
upon
them
merely
as
a
pair
of
acquaintances
above
all
when
he
had
heard
of
robin
determination
to
go
to
rheims
even
the
girl
saw
that
he
knew
nothing
in
spite
of
her
embarrassment
and
the
thought
that
had
come
to
her
when
she
had
heard
of
robin
coming
to
london
grew
on
her
every
moment
but
she
thought
she
must
gain
time
she
stood
up
you
would
like
to
see
his
letters
she
asked
i
will
bring
them
and
she
slipped
out
of
the
room
ii
anthony
babington
sat
still
staring
up
at
icarus
in
the
chariot
of
the
sun
with
something
of
a
moody
look
on
his
face
it
was
true
that
he
was
sincere
and
active
enough
in
all
that
he
did
up
here
in
the
north
for
the
priests
of
his
faith
indeed
he
risked
both
property
and
liberty
on
their
behalf
and
was
willing
to
continue
doing
so
as
long
as
these
were
left
to
him
but
it
seemed
to
him
sometimes
that
too
much
was
done
by
spiritual
ways
and
too
little
by
temporal
certainly
the
priesthood
and
the
mass
were
instruments
and
indeed
the
highest
instruments
in
god
hand
it
was
necessary
to
pray
and
receive
the
sacraments
and
to
run
every
risk
in
life
for
these
purposes
yet
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
highest
instruments
were
not
always
the
best
for
such
rough
work
it
was
now
over
two
years
ago
since
the
thought
had
first
come
to
him
and
since
that
time
he
had
spared
no
effort
to
shape
a
certain
other
weapon
which
he
thought
would
do
the
business
straight
and
clean
yet
how
difficult
it
had
been
to
raise
any
feeling
on
the
point
at
first
he
had
spoken
almost
freely
to
this
or
that
catholic
whom
he
could
trust
he
had
endeavoured
to
win
even
robin
and
yet
with
hardly
an
exception
all
had
drawn
back
and
bidden
him
be
content
with
a
spiritual
warfare
one
priest
indeed
had
gone
so
far
as
to
tell
him
that
he
was
on
dangerous
ground
and
the
one
and
single
man
who
up
to
the
present
had
seemed
on
his
side
was
the
very
man
ballard
then
a
layman
whom
he
had
met
by
chance
in
london
and
who
had
been
the
occasion
of
first
suggesting
any
such
idea
it
was
in
fact
for
the
sake
of
meeting
ballard
again
that
he
was
going
to
london
and
he
had
almost
thought
from
his
friend
last
letter
it
had
seemed
that
it
was
for
the
sake
of
meeting
him
that
ballard
was
coming
across
once
more
so
the
young
man
sat
with
that
moody
look
on
his
face
until
marjorie
came
back
wondering
what
news
he
would
have
from
ballard
and
whether
the
plan
at
present
only
half
conceived
was
to
go
forward
or
be
dropped
he
was
willing
enough
as
has
been
said
to
work
for
priests
and
he
had
been
perfectly
sincere
in
his
begging
marjorie
to
come
with
him
for
that
very
purpose
but
there
was
another
work
which
he
thought
still
more
urgent
however
that
was
not
to
be
affair
it
was
work
for
men
only
here
they
are
she
said
holding
out
the
packet
he
took
them
and
thanked
her
i
may
read
them
at
my
leisure
i
may
take
them
with
me
she
had
not
meant
that
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
why
yes
if
you
wish
she
said
stay
let
me
show
you
which
they
are
you
may
not
wish
to
take
them
all
the
letters
that
the
two
looked
over
together
in
that
wainscoted
parlour
at
booth
edge
lie
now
in
an
iron
case
in
a
certain
they
are
yellow
now
and
the
ink
is
faded
to
a
pale
dusky
red
and
they
must
not
be
roughly
unfolded
lest
they
should
crack
at
the
creases
but
they
were
fresh
then
written
on
stout
white
paper
each
occupying
one
side
of
a
sheet
that
was
then
folded
three
or
four
times
sealed
and
inscribed
to
mistress
marjorie
manners
in
the
middle
with
the
word
haste
in
the
lower
corner
the
lines
of
writing
run
close
together
and
the
flourishes
on
one
line
interweave
now
and
again
with
the
tails
on
the
next
the
first
was
written
within
a
week
of
robin
coming
to
rheims
and
told
the
tale
of
the
sailing
the
long
rides
that
followed
it
the
pleasure
the
writer
found
at
coming
to
a
catholic
country
and
something
of
his
adventures
upon
his
arrival
with
his
little
party
but
names
and
places
were
scrupulously
omitted
allen
was
described
as
my
host
and
in
more
than
one
instance
the
name
of
a
town
was
inscribed
with
a
line
drawn
beneath
it
to
indicate
that
this
was
a
kind
of
the
second
letter
gave
some
account
of
the
life
lived
in
rheims
was
a
real
boy
letter
and
this
was
more
difficult
to
treat
with
discretion
it
related
that
studies
occupied
a
certain
part
of
the
day
that
prayers
were
held
at
such
and
such
times
and
that
the
sports
consisted
chiefly
of
a
game
called
cat
so
with
the
eight
or
nine
that
followed
the
third
and
fourth
were
bolder
and
spoke
of
certain
definitely
catholic
practices
of
prayers
for
the
conversion
of
england
and
of
mass
said
on
certain
days
for
the
same
intention
it
seemed
as
if
the
writer
had
grown
confident
in
his
place
of
security
but
later
again
his
caution
returned
to
him
and
he
spoke
in
terms
so
veiled
that
even
marjorie
could
scarcely
understand
him
yet
on
the
whole
the
letters
if
they
had
fallen
into
hostile
hands
would
have
done
no
irreparable
injury
they
would
only
have
indicated
that
a
catholic
living
abroad
in
some
unnamed
university
or
college
was
writing
an
account
of
his
life
to
a
catholic
named
mistress
marjorie
manners
living
in
england
when
the
girl
had
finished
her
explaining
it
was
evident
that
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
anthony
to
take
them
with
him
he
said
so
ah
but
take
them
if
you
will
cried
the
girl
it
would
be
better
not
you
have
them
safe
here
and
marjorie
flushed
she
felt
that
her
ruse
had
been
too
plain
i
would
sooner
you
took
them
she
said
you
can
read
them
at
your
leisure
so
he
accepted
and
slipped
them
into
his
breast
with
what
seemed
to
the
girl
a
lamentable
carelessness
then
he
stood
up
i
must
go
he
said
and
i
have
never
asked
after
mistress
manners
she
is
abed
said
the
girl
she
has
been
there
this
past
month
now
she
went
with
him
to
the
door
for
it
was
not
until
then
that
she
was
courageous
enough
to
speak
as
she
had
determined
babington
she
said
suddenly
he
turned
i
have
been
thinking
while
we
talked
she
said
you
think
my
coming
to
london
would
be
of
real
service
i
think
so
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
meet
these
priests
before
they
then
i
will
come
if
my
mother
gives
me
leave
when
will
you
go
we
should
be
riding
in
not
less
than
a
week
from
now
but
mistress
no
i
have
thought
of
it
i
will
come
if
my
mother
gives
me
leave
he
nodded
briskly
and
brightly
he
loved
courage
and
he
understood
that
this
decision
of
hers
had
required
courage
then
my
sister
shall
come
for
you
and
no
babington
there
is
no
need
we
shall
start
from
derby
why
yes
then
my
maid
and
i
will
ride
down
there
and
sleep
at
the
inn
and
be
ready
for
you
on
the
day
that
you
appoint
when
he
was
gone
at
last
she
went
back
again
to
the
parlour
and
sat
without
moving
and
without
seeing
she
was
in
an
agony
lest
she
had
been
unmaidenly
in
determining
to
go
so
soon
as
she
heard
that
robin
was
to
be
there
chapter
ii
i
anthony
lifted
his
whip
and
pointed
london
he
said
marjorie
nodded
she
was
too
tired
to
speak
the
journey
had
taken
them
some
ten
days
by
easy
stages
each
night
they
had
slept
at
an
inn
except
once
when
they
stayed
with
friends
of
the
babingtons
and
had
heard
mass
they
had
had
the
small
and
usual
adventures
a
horse
had
fallen
lame
a
had
bolted
they
had
passed
two
or
three
they
had
been
stared
at
in
villages
and
saluted
and
stared
at
and
not
saluted
rain
had
fallen
the
clouds
had
cleared
again
and
the
clouds
had
gathered
once
more
and
rain
had
again
fallen
the
sun
morning
by
morning
had
stood
on
the
left
and
evening
by
evening
gone
down
again
on
the
right
they
were
a
small
party
for
so
long
a
journey
the
three
with
four
servants
two
men
and
two
maids
the
men
had
ridden
armed
as
the
custom
was
one
rode
in
front
then
came
the
two
ladies
with
anthony
then
the
two
maids
and
behind
them
the
second
man
in
towns
and
villages
they
closed
up
together
lest
they
should
be
separated
and
then
spread
out
once
more
as
the
long
straight
track
lengthened
before
them
anthony
and
the
two
carried
each
a
case
of
dags
or
pistols
at
the
for
fear
of
highwaymen
but
none
had
troubled
them
a
strange
dreamlike
mood
had
come
down
on
marjorie
at
times
it
seemed
to
her
in
her
fatigue
as
if
she
had
done
nothing
all
her
life
but
ride
at
times
as
she
sat
rocking
she
was
living
still
at
home
sitting
in
the
parlour
watching
her
mother
the
illusion
was
so
clear
and
continuous
that
its
departure
when
her
horse
stumbled
or
a
companion
spoke
was
as
an
awaking
from
a
dream
at
other
times
she
looked
about
her
talked
asked
questions
she
found
mistress
alice
babington
a
pleasant
friend
some
ten
years
older
than
herself
who
knew
london
well
and
had
plenty
to
tell
her
she
was
a
fair
woman
well
built
and
active
very
fond
of
her
brother
whom
she
treated
almost
as
a
mother
treats
a
son
but
she
seemed
not
to
be
in
his
confidence
and
even
not
to
wish
to
be
she
thought
more
of
his
comfort
than
of
his
ideals
she
was
a
catholic
of
course
but
of
the
quiet
assured
kind
and
seemed
unable
to
believe
that
anyone
could
seriously
be
anything
else
she
seemed
completely
confident
that
the
present
distress
was
a
passing
one
and
that
when
politics
had
run
their
course
it
would
presently
disappear
marjorie
found
her
as
comfortable
as
a
pillow
when
she
was
low
enough
to
rest
on
her
though
marjorie
had
nodded
only
when
the
spires
of
london
shone
up
suddenly
in
the
evening
light
a
sharp
internal
interest
awakened
in
her
it
was
as
astonishing
as
a
miracle
that
the
end
should
be
in
sight
the
past
ten
days
had
made
it
seem
to
her
as
if
all
things
which
she
desired
must
eternally
recede
she
touched
her
horse
unconsciously
and
stared
out
between
his
ears
sitting
upright
and
alert
again
it
was
not
a
great
deal
that
met
the
eye
but
it
was
so
disposed
as
to
suggest
a
great
deal
more
far
away
to
the
right
lay
a
faint
haze
and
in
it
appeared
towers
and
spires
with
gleams
of
sharp
white
here
and
there
where
some
tall
building
rose
above
the
dark
roofs
to
the
left
again
appeared
similar
signs
of
another
town
the
same
haze
towers
and
spires
linked
to
the
first
she
knew
what
they
were
she
had
heard
half
a
dozen
times
already
of
the
two
towns
that
made
london
running
continuously
in
one
long
line
however
which
grew
thin
by
hospital
and
martin
she
was
told
the
two
troops
of
houses
and
churches
that
had
grown
up
about
the
two
centres
of
court
and
city
westminster
and
the
city
itself
but
it
was
none
the
less
startling
to
see
these
with
her
proper
eyes
presently
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
saw
the
spire
of
dane
where
she
was
told
they
must
turn
she
began
to
talk
and
anthony
to
answer
ii
dark
was
beginning
to
fall
and
the
lamps
to
be
lighted
as
they
rode
in
at
last
half
an
hour
later
across
the
fleet
ditch
through
ludgate
and
turned
up
towards
cheapside
they
were
to
stay
at
an
inn
where
anthony
was
accustomed
to
lodge
when
he
was
not
with
friends
an
inn
too
of
which
the
landlord
was
in
sympathy
with
the
old
ways
and
where
friends
could
come
and
go
without
suspicion
it
was
here
perhaps
that
letters
would
be
waiting
for
them
from
rheims
marjorie
had
known
derby
only
among
the
greater
towns
and
neither
this
nor
the
towns
where
she
had
stayed
night
by
night
during
the
journey
had
prepared
her
in
the
least
for
the
amazing
rush
and
splendour
of
the
city
itself
a
fine
cold
rain
was
falling
and
this
she
was
told
had
driven
half
the
inhabitants
within
doors
but
even
so
it
appeared
to
her
that
london
was
far
beyond
her
imaginings
beneath
here
in
the
deep
and
narrow
channel
of
houses
up
which
they
rode
narrowed
yet
further
by
the
rows
of
stalls
that
were
ranged
along
the
pathways
on
either
side
the
lamps
were
kindling
swiftly
in
windows
as
well
as
in
the
street
here
and
there
hung
great
flaring
torches
and
the
vast
eaves
and
walls
overhead
shone
in
the
light
of
the
fires
where
the
rich
gilding
threw
it
back
beyond
them
again
solemn
and
towering
leaned
over
the
enormous
roofs
and
everywhere
it
seemed
to
her
fresh
from
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
country
countless
hundreds
of
moving
faces
were
turned
up
to
her
from
doorways
and
windows
as
well
as
from
the
groups
that
hurried
along
under
the
shelter
of
the
walls
and
the
air
was
full
of
talking
and
laughter
and
footsteps
it
meant
nothing
to
her
at
present
except
inextricable
confusion
the
gleam
of
arms
as
a
patrol
passed
by
the
important
little
group
making
its
way
with
torches
the
dogs
that
scuffled
in
the
roadway
the
party
of
apprentices
singing
together
loudly
with
linked
arms
plunging
up
a
side
street
the
hooded
women
chattering
together
with
gestures
beneath
a
roof
the
calling
from
side
to
side
of
the
twisting
street
the
bargaining
of
the
sellers
at
the
stalls
all
this
with
the
rattle
of
their
own
feet
and
the
jingling
of
the
bits
combined
only
to
make
a
noisy
and
brilliant
spectacle
without
sense
or
signification
mistress
alice
glanced
at
her
smiling
you
are
tired
she
said
we
are
nearly
there
that
is
paul
on
the
right
ah
that
gave
her
peace
they
were
turning
off
from
the
main
street
just
as
her
friend
spoke
but
she
had
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
appeared
at
first
sight
a
mere
gulf
of
darkness
and
then
as
they
turned
resolved
itself
into
a
vast
and
solemn
pile
against
black
lights
burned
far
across
the
wide
churchyard
as
well
as
in
the
windows
of
the
high
houses
that
crowned
the
wall
and
figures
moved
against
the
glow
tiny
as
dolls
then
she
remembered
again
how
god
had
once
been
worshipped
there
indeed
in
the
great
house
built
to
his
honour
but
was
no
longer
so
worshipped
or
if
it
were
the
same
god
as
some
claimed
at
least
the
character
of
him
was
very
differently
conceived
the
red
bull
again
increased
her
sense
of
rest
since
all
inns
are
alike
a
curved
archway
opened
on
the
narrow
street
and
beneath
this
they
rode
to
find
themselves
in
a
paved
court
already
lighted
surrounded
by
walls
and
high
galleries
to
right
and
left
the
stamping
of
horses
from
the
further
end
and
almost
immediately
the
appearance
of
a
couple
of
hostlers
showed
where
the
stables
lay
beside
it
she
could
see
through
the
door
of
the
she
was
terribly
stiff
as
she
found
when
she
limped
up
the
three
or
four
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
door
of
the
of
the
inn
and
she
was
glad
enough
to
sit
down
in
a
wide
low
parlour
with
her
friend
as
babington
went
in
search
of
the
host
the
room
was
lighted
only
by
a
fire
leaping
in
the
chimney
and
she
could
make
out
little
except
that
pieces
of
stuff
hung
upon
the
walls
and
a
long
row
of
metal
vessels
and
plates
were
ranged
in
a
rack
between
the
windows
it
is
a
quiet
inn
said
alice
marjorie
nodded
again
she
was
too
tired
to
speak
and
almost
immediately
anthony
came
back
with
a
tall
man
in
an
apron
following
behind
it
is
all
well
he
said
we
can
have
our
rooms
and
the
parlour
complete
these
are
the
ladies
he
added
the
landlord
bowed
a
little
with
a
dignity
beyond
that
of
his
dress
supper
shall
be
served
immediately
madam
he
said
with
a
tactful
impartiality
towards
them
both
they
were
indeed
very
pleasant
rooms
and
as
anthony
had
described
them
to
her
were
situated
towards
the
back
of
the
long
low
house
on
the
first
floor
with
a
private
staircase
leading
straight
up
from
the
yard
to
the
parlour
itself
the
too
opened
upon
the
parlour
that
which
the
two
ladies
were
to
occupy
was
furthest
from
the
yard
for
quietness
sake
that
in
which
anthony
and
his
man
would
sleep
upon
the
other
side
the
windows
of
all
three
looked
straight
out
upon
a
little
walled
garden
that
appeared
to
be
the
property
of
some
other
house
the
rooms
were
plainly
furnished
but
had
a
sort
of
dignity
about
them
especially
in
the
carved
woodwork
about
the
doors
and
windows
there
was
a
fireplace
in
the
parlour
plainly
a
recent
addition
and
a
maid
rose
from
kindling
the
logs
and
turf
as
the
two
ladies
came
back
after
washing
and
changing
a
table
was
already
laid
lit
by
a
couple
of
candles
it
was
laid
with
fine
napery
and
the
cutlery
was
clean
and
solid
marjorie
looked
round
the
room
once
more
and
as
she
sat
down
anthony
came
in
still
in
his
dress
carrying
three
or
four
letters
in
his
hands
news
he
said
i
will
be
with
you
immediately
and
vanished
into
his
room
the
sense
of
home
was
deepening
on
marjorie
every
moment
this
room
in
which
she
sat
might
with
a
little
fancy
be
thought
to
resemble
the
hall
at
booth
edge
it
was
not
so
high
indeed
but
the
plain
solidity
of
the
walls
and
woodwork
the
aspect
of
the
and
the
quiet
so
refreshing
after
the
noises
of
the
day
and
above
all
after
the
din
of
their
ride
through
the
city
these
little
things
together
with
the
knowledge
that
the
journey
was
done
at
last
and
that
her
old
friend
robin
was
if
not
already
come
at
least
soon
to
arrive
these
little
things
helped
to
soothe
and
reassure
her
she
wondered
how
her
mother
found
herself
when
anthony
came
back
the
supper
was
all
laid
out
he
had
given
orders
that
no
waiting
was
to
be
done
his
own
servants
would
do
what
was
necessary
he
had
a
bright
and
interested
face
marjorie
thought
and
the
instant
they
were
sat
down
she
knew
the
reason
of
it
we
are
just
in
time
he
said
these
letters
have
been
lying
here
for
me
the
last
week
they
will
be
here
they
tell
me
by
night
but
that
is
not
all
he
glanced
round
the
dusky
room
then
he
laid
down
the
knife
with
which
he
was
carving
and
spoke
in
a
yet
lower
voice
father
campion
is
in
the
house
he
said
his
sister
started
in
the
house
do
you
mean
he
nodded
mysteriously
as
he
took
up
the
knife
again
he
has
been
here
three
or
four
days
the
rooms
are
full
in
the
in
the
usual
place
and
i
have
spoken
with
him
he
is
coming
here
after
supper
he
had
already
supped
marjorie
leaned
back
in
her
chair
but
she
said
nothing
from
beneath
in
the
house
came
the
sound
of
singing
from
the
tavern
parlour
where
boys
were
performing
madrigals
it
seemed
to
her
incredible
that
she
should
presently
be
speaking
with
the
man
whose
name
was
already
affecting
england
as
perhaps
no
name
had
ever
affected
it
he
had
been
in
england
she
knew
comparatively
a
short
time
yet
in
that
time
his
name
had
run
like
fire
from
mouth
to
mouth
to
the
minds
of
protestants
there
was
something
almost
diabolical
about
the
man
he
was
here
he
was
there
he
was
everywhere
and
yet
when
the
search
was
up
he
was
nowhere
tales
were
told
of
his
eloquence
that
increased
the
impression
that
he
made
a
it
was
said
that
he
could
wile
birds
off
their
branches
and
the
beasts
from
their
lairs
and
this
eloquence
it
was
known
could
be
heard
only
by
initiates
in
country
houses
or
in
quiet
unsuspected
places
in
the
cities
he
preached
in
some
shrouded
and
locked
room
in
london
one
day
and
the
next
thirty
miles
off
in
a
to
rustics
and
his
learning
and
his
subtlety
were
equal
to
his
eloquence
her
grace
had
heard
him
at
oxford
years
ago
before
his
conversion
and
it
was
said
would
refuse
him
nothing
even
now
if
he
would
but
be
reasonable
in
his
religion
even
canterbury
it
was
reported
might
be
his
and
if
he
would
not
be
reasonable
then
as
was
fully
in
accordance
with
what
was
known
of
her
grace
nothing
was
too
bad
for
him
such
feeling
then
on
the
part
of
protestants
found
its
fellow
in
that
of
the
catholics
he
was
their
champion
as
no
other
man
could
be
had
he
not
issued
his
famous
challenge
to
any
and
all
of
the
protestant
divines
to
meet
them
in
any
argument
on
religion
that
they
cared
to
select
in
any
place
and
at
any
time
if
only
his
own
were
secure
and
was
it
not
notorious
that
none
would
meet
him
he
was
indeed
a
fire
a
smoke
in
the
nostrils
of
his
adversaries
a
flame
in
the
hearts
of
his
friends
everywhere
he
ranged
he
and
his
comrade
father
persons
sometimes
in
company
sometimes
apart
and
wherever
they
went
the
faith
blazed
up
anew
from
its
dying
embers
in
the
lives
of
rustic
knave
and
squire
and
she
was
to
see
him
he
is
here
for
four
or
five
days
only
went
on
anthony
presently
still
in
a
low
cautious
voice
the
hunt
is
very
hot
they
say
not
even
the
host
knows
who
he
is
or
at
least
makes
that
he
does
not
he
is
under
another
name
of
course
it
is
edmonds
this
time
he
was
in
essex
he
tells
me
but
comes
to
the
wolves
den
for
safety
it
is
safer
he
says
to
sit
secure
in
the
midst
of
the
trap
than
to
wander
about
its
doors
for
when
the
doors
are
opened
he
can
run
out
again
if
no
one
knows
he
is
there
iii
when
supper
was
finished
at
last
and
the
maids
had
borne
away
the
dishes
there
came
almost
immediately
a
tap
upon
the
door
and
before
any
could
answer
there
walked
in
a
man
smiling
he
was
of
dressed
in
a
dark
gentleman
suit
carrying
his
feathered
hat
in
his
hand
with
his
sword
he
appeared
far
younger
than
marjorie
had
expected
scarcely
more
than
thirty
years
old
of
a
dark
and
yet
clear
complexion
with
a
look
of
humour
his
hair
was
long
and
brushed
back
and
a
soft
pointed
beard
and
moustache
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
moved
briskly
and
assuredly
as
one
wholly
at
his
ease
i
am
come
to
the
right
room
he
said
that
is
as
well
his
voice
too
had
a
ring
of
gaiety
in
it
it
was
low
quite
clear
and
very
sympathetic
and
his
manners
as
marjorie
observed
were
those
of
a
cultivated
gentleman
without
even
a
trace
of
the
priest
she
would
not
have
been
astonished
if
she
had
been
told
that
the
man
was
of
the
court
or
some
great
personage
of
the
country
there
was
no
trace
of
furtive
hurry
or
of
alarm
about
him
he
moved
deftly
and
confidently
and
when
he
sat
down
after
the
proper
greetings
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
so
that
he
could
nurse
his
foot
it
seemed
more
incredible
even
than
she
had
thought
that
this
was
father
campion
you
have
pleasant
rooms
here
and
music
to
cheer
you
too
he
said
i
understand
that
you
are
often
here
mr
babington
anthony
explained
that
he
found
them
convenient
and
very
secure
roberts
is
a
prudent
landlord
he
said
father
campion
nodded
he
knows
his
own
business
which
is
what
few
landlords
do
in
these
degenerate
days
and
he
knows
nothing
at
all
of
his
guests
in
that
he
is
even
more
of
an
exception
his
eyes
twinkled
delightfully
at
the
ladies
and
so
he
said
god
blesses
him
in
those
who
use
his
house
they
talked
for
a
few
minutes
in
this
manner
father
campion
spoke
of
the
high
duty
that
lay
on
all
country
ladies
to
make
themselves
acquainted
with
the
sights
of
the
town
and
spoke
of
three
or
four
of
these
her
grace
of
course
must
be
seen
that
was
the
greatest
sight
of
all
they
must
make
an
opportunity
for
that
and
there
would
surely
be
no
difficulty
since
her
grace
liked
nothing
better
than
to
be
looked
at
and
they
must
go
up
the
river
by
water
if
the
weather
allowed
from
the
tower
to
westminster
not
from
westminster
to
the
tower
since
that
was
the
way
that
traitors
came
and
no
good
catholic
could
even
in
appearance
be
a
traitor
and
if
they
pleased
he
would
himself
be
their
guide
for
a
part
of
their
adventures
he
was
to
lie
hid
he
told
them
and
he
knew
no
better
way
to
do
that
than
to
flaunt
as
boldly
as
possible
in
the
open
ways
if
i
lay
in
my
room
said
he
with
a
bolt
drawn
i
would
soon
have
some
busy
fellow
knocking
on
the
door
to
know
what
i
did
there
but
if
i
could
but
dine
with
her
grace
or
take
an
hour
with
topcliffe
i
should
be
secure
for
ever
marjorie
glanced
shyly
towards
alice
as
if
to
ask
a
question
she
was
listening
it
seemed
to
her
with
every
nerve
in
her
tired
body
the
priest
saw
the
glance
topcliffe
madam
well
let
us
say
he
is
a
dear
friend
of
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
and
has
i
think
lodgings
there
just
now
and
he
is
even
a
friend
of
catholics
too
to
such
at
least
as
desire
a
heavenly
crown
he
is
an
informer
and
a
tormentor
broke
in
anthony
harshly
well
sir
let
us
say
that
he
is
very
loyal
to
the
letter
of
the
law
and
that
he
presides
over
our
protestant
bed
of
procrustes
the
began
marjorie
emboldened
by
the
kindness
of
the
voice
the
bed
of
procrustes
madam
was
a
bed
to
which
all
who
lay
upon
it
had
to
be
conformed
those
that
were
too
long
were
made
short
and
those
that
were
too
short
were
made
long
it
is
a
pleasant
classical
name
for
the
rack
marjorie
caught
her
breath
but
father
campion
went
on
smoothly
we
shall
have
a
clear
day
i
think
he
said
if
you
are
at
liberty
sir
and
these
ladies
are
not
too
wearied
i
have
a
little
business
in
westminster
and
why
yes
said
anthony
for
night
we
expect
friends
from
rheims
sir
the
priest
dropped
his
foot
and
leaned
forward
from
rheims
he
said
sharply
the
other
nodded
eight
or
ten
at
least
will
arrive
not
all
are
priests
one
is
a
friend
of
our
own
from
derbyshire
who
will
not
be
made
priest
for
five
years
yet
i
had
not
heard
they
were
to
come
so
soon
said
father
campion
and
what
a
company
of
them
there
are
a
few
of
them
who
have
been
here
before
ballard
is
one
of
them
the
priest
was
silent
an
instant
ballard
he
said
ballard
yes
he
has
been
here
before
he
travels
as
captain
fortescue
does
he
not
you
are
a
friend
of
his
yes
sir
father
campion
made
as
if
he
would
speak
but
interrupted
himself
and
was
silent
and
it
seemed
to
marjorie
as
if
another
mood
was
fallen
on
him
and
presently
they
were
talking
again
of
london
and
its
sights
iv
in
spite
of
her
weariness
marjorie
could
not
sleep
for
an
hour
or
two
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
it
was
an
extraordinary
experience
to
her
to
have
fallen
in
on
the
very
night
of
her
coming
to
london
with
the
one
man
whose
name
stood
to
her
for
all
that
was
gallant
in
her
faith
as
she
lay
there
listening
to
the
steady
breathing
of
alice
who
knew
no
such
tremors
of
romance
to
the
occasional
stamp
of
a
horse
across
the
yard
and
once
or
twice
to
voices
and
footsteps
passing
on
some
paved
way
between
the
houses
she
rehearsed
again
and
again
to
herself
the
tales
she
had
heard
of
him
now
and
again
she
thought
of
robin
she
wondered
whether
he
too
one
day
and
not
of
necessity
a
day
since
promotion
came
quickly
in
this
war
of
faith
would
occupy
some
post
like
that
which
this
man
held
so
gaily
and
so
courageously
and
for
the
first
time
perhaps
she
understood
not
in
vision
merely
but
in
sober
thought
what
the
life
of
a
priest
in
those
days
signified
certainly
she
had
met
man
after
man
before
she
had
entertained
them
often
enough
in
her
place
and
had
provided
by
her
own
wits
for
their
security
men
who
went
in
peril
of
liberty
and
even
of
life
but
here
within
the
walls
of
london
in
this
wolves
den
as
father
campion
had
called
it
where
men
brushed
against
one
another
continually
and
looked
into
a
thousand
faces
a
day
where
patrols
went
noisily
with
lights
and
weapons
where
the
great
tower
stood
where
her
grace
the
mistress
of
the
wolves
had
her
dwelling
here
peril
assumed
another
aspect
and
pain
and
death
another
reality
from
that
which
they
presented
on
the
hills
and
the
secret
valleys
of
the
country
from
which
they
came
and
it
was
with
father
campion
himself
in
his
very
flesh
that
she
had
talked
this
evening
it
was
father
campion
who
had
given
her
that
swift
kindly
look
of
commendation
as
babington
had
spoken
of
her
reason
for
coming
to
london
and
of
her
hospitality
to
wandering
priests
father
campion
the
angel
of
the
church
was
in
england
and
robin
too
would
be
here
then
as
sleep
began
to
come
down
on
her
tired
and
excited
brain
and
to
form
as
so
often
under
such
conditions
little
visible
images
even
before
the
reason
itself
is
lulled
there
began
to
pass
before
her
first
tiny
and
delicate
pictures
of
what
she
had
seen
the
low
hills
to
the
north
of
london
dull
and
dark
below
the
heavy
sky
but
light
immediately
above
the
horizon
as
the
sun
sank
down
the
appearance
of
her
horse
ears
those
ears
and
that
tuft
of
wayward
mane
between
them
of
which
she
had
grown
so
weary
the
lighted
walls
of
the
london
streets
the
monstrous
shadows
of
the
eaves
the
flare
of
lights
the
moving
figures
these
came
first
and
then
faces
father
campion
smiling
with
white
teeth
and
narrowed
eyes
bright
against
the
dark
alice
serene
features
framed
in
flaxen
hair
and
then
as
sleep
had
all
but
conquered
her
the
imagination
sent
up
one
last
idea
and
a
face
came
into
being
before
her
so
formless
yet
so
full
so
sinister
so
fierce
and
so
distorted
that
she
drew
a
sudden
breath
and
sat
up
trembling
why
had
they
spoken
to
her
of
topcliffe
chapter
iii
i
it
was
a
soft
winter
morning
as
the
party
came
down
the
little
slope
towards
the
of
the
tower
next
day
the
rain
last
night
had
cleared
the
air
and
the
sun
shone
as
through
thin
veils
of
haze
kindly
and
sweet
the
river
on
the
right
was
at
high
tide
and
up
from
the
water
edge
came
the
cries
of
the
boatmen
pleasant
and
invigorating
the
sense
of
unreality
was
deeper
than
ever
on
marjorie
mind
one
incredible
thing
after
another
known
to
her
only
in
the
past
by
rumour
and
description
and
imagined
in
a
frame
of
glory
was
taking
shape
before
her
eyes
she
was
in
london
she
had
slept
in
cheapside
she
had
talked
with
father
campion
he
was
with
her
now
this
was
the
tower
of
london
that
lay
before
her
a
monstrous
huddle
of
grey
towers
and
battlemented
walls
along
which
passed
the
scarlet
of
a
livery
and
the
gleam
of
arms
all
the
way
that
they
had
walked
her
eyes
had
been
about
her
everywhere
the
eyes
of
a
startled
child
through
which
looked
the
soul
of
a
woman
she
had
seen
the
folks
go
past
like
actors
in
a
drama
london
merchants
apprentices
a
party
of
soldiers
a
group
on
horseback
she
had
seen
a
congregation
pour
out
of
the
doors
of
some
church
whose
name
she
had
asked
and
had
forgotten
again
the
cobbled
patches
of
street
had
been
a
marvel
to
her
the
endless
roofs
the
white
and
black
walls
the
leaning
windows
the
galleries
where
heads
moved
the
vast
wharfs
the
crowding
masts
resembling
a
stripped
forest
the
sailors
and
above
all
the
steady
murmur
of
voices
and
footsteps
never
ceasing
beyond
which
the
crowing
of
cocks
and
the
barking
of
dogs
sounded
far
off
and
apart
these
things
combined
to
make
a
kind
of
miracle
that
all
at
once
delighted
oppressed
and
bewildered
her
here
and
there
some
personage
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
by
the
trim
merry
gentleman
who
walked
by
her
side
with
his
sword
swinging
anthony
went
with
his
sister
just
behind
as
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
crowded
streets
and
the
two
followed
she
saw
a
couple
of
city
dignitaries
in
their
furs
with
stavesmen
to
clear
their
road
a
little
troop
of
the
queen
horse
blazing
with
colour
under
the
command
of
a
young
officer
who
might
have
come
straight
from
romance
but
she
was
more
absorbed
or
rather
she
returned
every
instant
to
the
man
who
walked
beside
her
with
such
an
air
and
talked
so
loudly
and
cheerfully
certainly
it
seemed
to
her
his
disguise
was
perfect
and
himself
the
best
part
of
it
she
compared
him
in
her
mind
with
a
couple
of
ministers
splendid
and
awful
in
their
gowns
and
ruffs
whom
they
had
met
turning
into
one
of
the
churches
just
now
and
smiled
at
the
comparison
and
yet
perhaps
these
were
preachers
too
and
eloquent
in
their
own
fashion
and
now
here
was
the
tower
the
end
of
all
things
so
far
as
london
was
concerned
beyond
it
she
saw
the
wide
rolling
hills
the
bright
reaches
of
the
river
and
the
sparkle
of
placentia
far
away
her
grace
is
at
westminster
these
days
exclaimed
the
priest
she
is
moving
to
hampton
court
in
a
day
or
two
so
i
doubt
not
we
shall
be
able
to
go
in
and
see
a
little
we
shall
see
at
least
the
outside
of
the
paradise
where
so
many
holy
ones
have
lived
and
died
there
are
three
or
four
of
them
here
now
but
the
most
of
them
are
in
the
fleet
or
the
marshalsea
marjorie
glanced
at
him
she
did
not
understand
i
mean
catholic
prisoners
mistress
there
are
several
of
them
in
ward
here
but
we
had
better
speak
no
names
he
wheeled
suddenly
as
they
came
out
into
the
open
and
moved
to
the
left
there
is
tower
hill
mistress
where
my
lord
cardinal
fisher
died
and
thomas
more
marjorie
stopped
short
but
there
was
nothing
great
to
see
only
a
rising
ground
empty
and
bare
with
a
few
trimmed
trees
the
ground
was
without
grass
a
few
cobbled
paths
crossed
this
way
and
that
and
here
is
the
gateway
he
said
whence
they
come
out
to
glory
and
there
on
the
right
he
swept
his
arm
towards
the
river
you
may
see
if
you
are
fortunate
other
criminals
called
pirates
hung
there
till
they
be
covered
by
three
tides
still
standing
there
with
babington
and
his
sister
come
up
from
behind
he
began
to
relate
the
names
of
this
tower
and
of
that
in
the
great
tumbled
mass
of
buildings
surmounted
by
the
high
keep
but
marjorie
paid
no
great
attention
except
with
an
effort
she
was
brooding
rather
on
the
amazing
significance
of
all
that
she
saw
it
was
under
this
gateway
that
the
martyrs
came
it
was
from
those
windows
in
that
tower
which
the
priest
had
named
just
now
that
they
had
looked
and
this
was
father
campion
she
turned
and
watched
him
as
he
talked
he
was
dressed
as
he
had
been
dressed
last
night
but
with
a
small
cloak
thrown
over
his
shoulders
he
gesticulated
freely
and
easily
pointing
out
this
and
that
now
and
again
his
eyes
met
hers
and
there
was
nothing
but
a
grave
merriment
in
them
only
once
or
twice
his
voice
softened
as
he
spoke
of
those
great
ones
that
had
shown
catholics
how
both
to
die
and
live
and
now
he
said
with
your
permission
i
will
go
and
speak
to
the
guard
and
see
if
we
may
have
entrance
it
was
almost
with
terror
that
she
saw
him
go
a
solitary
man
with
a
price
on
his
head
straight
up
to
those
whose
business
it
was
to
catch
him
armed
men
as
she
could
see
she
could
even
see
the
quilted
jacks
they
wore
who
it
may
be
had
talked
of
him
in
the
only
last
night
but
his
air
was
so
assured
and
so
magnificent
that
even
she
began
to
understand
how
complete
such
a
disguise
might
be
and
she
watched
him
speaking
with
the
officer
with
a
touch
even
of
his
own
humour
in
her
heart
indeed
there
was
some
truth
in
the
charge
of
jesuitry
after
all
then
the
figure
turned
and
beckoned
and
they
went
forward
ii
a
certain
horror
in
spite
of
herself
and
her
company
fell
on
her
as
she
passed
beneath
the
solid
stone
vaulting
passed
along
beneath
the
towering
wall
turned
up
from
the
and
came
out
into
the
wide
court
round
which
the
lieutenant
lodgings
the
little
church
and
the
enormous
white
tower
itself
are
grouped
there
was
a
space
not
enclosed
in
any
way
but
situated
within
a
web
of
paths
not
far
from
the
church
that
caught
her
attention
she
stood
looking
at
it
yes
mistress
said
the
priest
behind
her
that
is
the
place
of
execution
for
those
who
die
within
the
tower
those
usually
of
royal
blood
my
lady
salisbury
died
there
and
my
lady
jane
grey
and
others
he
laid
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
you
must
not
look
so
grave
he
said
you
must
gape
more
you
are
a
madam
and
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
met
his
eyes
tell
me
everything
she
said
they
went
together
nearer
to
the
church
and
faced
about
we
can
see
better
from
here
he
said
then
he
began
first
there
was
the
lieutenant
lodging
on
the
right
they
must
look
well
at
that
interviews
had
taken
place
there
that
had
made
history
he
mentioned
a
few
names
then
further
down
on
the
right
beyond
that
corner
round
which
they
had
come
just
now
was
the
famous
called
traitors
gate
through
which
passed
those
convicted
of
treason
at
westminster
or
at
least
those
who
were
under
grave
suspicion
such
as
these
came
of
course
by
water
as
prisoners
on
whose
behalf
a
demonstration
might
perhaps
be
made
if
they
came
by
land
so
at
least
he
understood
was
the
reason
of
the
custom
her
grace
herself
once
came
that
way
he
said
with
a
twinkle
now
she
sends
other
folks
in
her
stead
then
he
pointed
out
more
clearly
the
white
tower
it
was
there
that
the
council
sat
on
affairs
of
importance
and
it
is
there
began
anthony
harshly
the
priest
turned
to
him
suddenly
grave
as
if
in
reproof
yes
he
said
softly
it
is
there
that
the
passion
of
the
martyrs
begins
marjorie
turned
sharply
you
mean
well
he
said
it
is
there
that
the
council
sits
to
examine
prisoners
both
before
and
after
the
question
they
are
taken
downstairs
to
the
question
and
brought
back
again
after
it
it
was
there
that
he
broke
off
who
is
this
he
said
the
court
had
been
empty
while
they
talked
except
that
on
the
far
side
beneath
the
towering
cliff
of
the
keep
a
sentry
went
to
and
fro
but
now
another
man
had
come
into
view
walking
up
from
the
way
they
themselves
had
come
and
it
would
appear
from
the
direction
he
took
that
he
would
pass
within
twenty
or
thirty
yards
of
them
he
was
a
tall
man
dressed
in
clothes
with
a
felt
hat
on
his
head
and
the
usual
sword
by
his
side
he
was
plainly
something
of
a
personage
for
he
walked
easily
and
confidently
he
was
still
some
distance
off
but
it
was
possible
to
make
out
that
he
was
sallowish
in
complexion
wore
a
trimmed
beard
and
had
something
of
a
long
throat
father
campion
stared
at
him
a
moment
and
as
he
stared
marjorie
heard
babington
utter
a
sudden
exclamation
then
the
priest
with
one
quick
glance
at
him
murmured
something
which
marjorie
could
not
hear
and
walked
briskly
off
to
meet
the
stranger
come
said
anthony
in
a
sharp
low
voice
we
must
see
the
church
who
is
it
whispered
mistress
alice
with
even
her
serene
face
a
little
troubled
for
the
first
moment
as
they
walked
towards
the
entrance
of
the
church
anthony
said
nothing
then
as
they
reached
it
he
said
in
a
tone
quite
low
and
yet
full
of
suppressed
passion
of
some
kind
a
name
that
marjorie
could
not
catch
she
turned
before
they
went
in
and
looked
again
the
priest
was
talking
to
the
stranger
and
was
making
gestures
as
if
asking
for
direction
who
is
it
mr
babington
she
asked
again
as
they
went
in
i
did
not
topcliffe
said
anthony
iii
the
horror
was
still
on
the
girl
as
they
went
an
hour
later
up
the
ebbing
tide
towards
westminster
in
a
boat
rowed
by
a
waterman
and
one
of
their
own
servants
about
them
was
a
scene
of
which
the
very
thought
a
month
ago
would
have
absorbed
and
fascinated
her
they
had
scarcely
passed
through
london
bridge
finding
themselves
just
in
time
before
the
fall
of
the
water
would
have
hindered
their
passage
leaving
out
of
sight
the
grey
sunlit
heap
of
buildings
from
which
they
had
come
all
about
them
the
river
was
gay
with
shipping
wherries
like
clumsy
lurched
along
out
of
the
current
or
slipped
out
suddenly
to
make
their
way
across
from
one
stairs
to
another
a
great
barge
coming
grew
larger
every
instant
its
prow
bright
with
gilding
and
the
throb
of
the
twelve
oars
in
the
coming
to
them
like
the
grunting
of
a
beast
on
either
side
of
the
broad
stream
rose
the
houses
and
the
churches
those
on
this
side
visible
down
to
their
shining
in
the
sunlight
and
the
very
texture
of
their
tiled
roofs
those
on
the
other
a
mere
huddle
of
countless
walls
and
gables
in
the
shadow
and
between
them
showed
the
leafless
trees
stretches
of
green
meadow
across
which
moved
tiny
figures
and
the
brown
flats
of
the
marshes
beyond
broken
here
and
there
by
outlying
villages
a
mile
or
two
away
behind
them
now
towered
the
great
buildings
on
london
bridge
the
chapel
the
houses
the
old
gateway
on
the
south
end
above
which
the
impaled
heads
of
traitors
stood
out
against
the
bright
sky
it
was
a
tolerable
crop
just
now
the
priest
had
said
bitterly
smiling
but
above
all
else
as
the
boat
moved
up
marjorie
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
westminster
on
the
grey
towers
and
the
white
walls
where
elizabeth
reigned
and
saint
edward
slept
while
within
her
mind
clear
as
a
picture
she
saw
still
the
empty
court
as
she
had
seen
it
when
the
priest
fetched
them
out
again
from
the
church
empty
at
last
of
the
hateful
presence
which
he
had
faced
so
confidently
it
appeared
to
me
best
to
speak
with
him
openly
said
the
priest
quietly
as
they
had
waited
ten
minutes
later
on
the
wharf
outside
the
tower
while
the
men
ran
to
make
ready
their
boat
i
do
not
know
why
but
i
suppose
i
am
one
of
those
who
better
like
their
danger
in
front
than
behind
i
knew
him
at
once
i
have
had
him
pointed
out
to
me
two
or
three
times
before
so
i
looked
him
in
the
eyes
and
asked
him
whether
some
ladies
from
the
country
might
be
permitted
to
see
the
white
tower
and
to
whom
we
had
best
apply
he
told
me
that
was
not
his
affair
and
looked
me
up
and
down
as
he
said
it
and
then
he
went
his
way
to
the
white
tower
where
i
doubt
not
he
had
business
he
said
no
more
asked
anthony
no
he
said
no
more
but
i
shall
know
him
again
better
next
time
and
he
me
it
seemed
of
evil
omen
to
the
girl
that
she
should
have
had
such
an
encounter
on
the
day
that
robin
came
back
like
all
persons
who
dwell
much
in
the
country
a
world
that
was
neither
that
of
the
flesh
nor
yet
of
the
spirit
was
that
in
which
she
largely
moved
a
world
of
strange
laws
and
auspices
and
this
answering
to
this
and
that
to
that
it
is
a
state
inconceivable
to
those
who
live
in
the
noise
and
movement
of
town
who
find
that
is
the
life
in
which
they
are
most
at
ease
for
where
men
have
made
the
earth
that
is
trodden
underfoot
and
have
largely
veiled
the
heavens
themselves
it
is
but
natural
that
they
should
think
that
they
have
made
everything
and
that
it
is
they
who
rule
it
as
they
drew
nearer
westminster
then
it
was
with
marjorie
as
it
had
been
when
they
came
to
the
tower
the
priest
was
busy
pointing
out
this
or
that
building
the
palace
towers
the
hall
the
abbey
behind
and
margaret
church
as
well
as
the
smaller
buildings
of
the
court
and
the
little
town
that
lay
round
about
but
she
listened
as
she
listened
to
the
noise
that
came
from
the
streets
clear
across
the
water
attending
to
it
yet
scarcely
distinguishing
one
thing
from
another
and
forgetting
each
as
soon
as
she
heard
it
she
was
thinking
all
the
while
of
robin
and
of
the
man
whose
face
she
had
seen
of
his
beard
and
his
long
throat
well
at
least
robin
was
not
yet
a
priest
the
boat
was
already
nearing
the
king
stairs
at
westminster
when
a
new
event
happened
that
for
a
while
distracted
her
the
first
they
saw
of
it
was
the
sight
of
a
number
of
men
and
women
running
in
a
disorderly
mob
calling
out
as
they
ran
along
the
in
the
direction
from
charing
old
cross
towards
palace
yard
they
appeared
excited
but
not
by
fear
and
it
was
plain
that
something
was
taking
place
of
which
they
wished
to
have
a
sight
as
the
priest
stood
up
in
the
boat
in
order
to
have
a
clearer
sight
of
what
lay
above
the
bank
three
or
four
of
a
peculiar
melody
rang
out
clear
and
distinct
echoed
back
by
the
walls
round
about
plainly
audible
above
the
rising
noise
of
a
crowd
that
it
seemed
must
be
gathering
out
of
sight
the
priest
sat
down
again
and
his
face
was
merry
you
have
come
on
a
fortunate
day
mistress
he
said
to
marjorie
first
topcliffe
and
now
her
grace
if
we
make
haste
we
may
see
her
pass
by
her
grace
she
will
be
going
to
dinner
in
whitehall
after
having
taken
the
air
by
the
river
they
will
be
passing
the
abbey
now
but
she
will
not
be
in
her
supreme
state
i
am
sorry
for
that
as
they
rowed
in
quickly
over
the
last
hundred
yards
that
lay
between
them
and
the
stairs
marjorie
listened
to
the
priest
as
he
described
something
of
what
the
supreme
state
signified
he
spoke
of
the
long
lines
of
carriages
filled
with
the
ladies
and
the
infirm
preceded
by
the
pikemen
and
the
gentlemen
pensioners
carrying
wands
and
the
knights
followed
by
the
heralds
behind
these
he
said
came
the
officers
of
state
immediately
before
the
queen
carriage
and
after
her
the
guards
of
her
person
but
this
will
be
but
a
tame
affair
he
said
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
a
progress
with
the
arches
and
the
speeches
and
the
declamations
and
the
heathen
gods
and
goddesses
that
reign
round
our
eliza
when
she
will
go
to
ashridge
or
havering
i
have
heard
it
said
and
then
the
prow
of
the
boat
turned
deftly
at
the
last
instant
grated
along
the
lowest
stair
and
the
waterman
was
out
to
steady
his
craft
iv
it
was
the
very
crown
and
summit
of
new
sensation
that
marjorie
attained
as
she
stood
in
an
open
gallery
that
looked
on
to
the
road
from
westminster
to
whitehall
father
campion
speaking
of
a
good
friend
of
his
that
had
his
lodgings
there
led
them
by
a
short
turning
or
two
that
avoided
the
crowd
straight
to
the
door
of
what
appeared
to
marjorie
a
mere
warren
of
rooms
stairs
and
passages
a
grave
little
man
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
ran
out
upon
their
knocking
at
one
of
these
doors
and
led
them
straight
through
smiling
and
talking
out
into
this
very
gallery
where
they
now
stood
and
then
vanished
again
the
gallery
was
such
as
those
which
marjorie
had
noted
on
the
way
to
the
tower
a
airy
place
running
the
length
of
the
house
contrived
on
the
level
of
the
second
floor
with
the
first
floor
roof
beneath
and
overhanging
attics
above
it
was
supported
on
massive
oak
beams
and
protected
from
the
street
by
a
low
balustrade
of
a
height
to
lean
the
elbows
upon
it
it
was
on
this
balustrade
that
marjorie
leaned
looking
down
into
the
street
to
the
left
the
narrow
roadway
curved
off
out
of
sight
in
the
direction
of
palace
yard
on
the
right
she
could
make
out
a
hundred
yards
away
some
kind
of
a
gateway
that
strode
across
the
street
and
gave
access
she
supposed
to
the
palace
opposite
the
windows
were
filled
with
faces
and
an
enthusiastic
loyalist
was
leaning
and
vociferous
calling
to
a
friend
in
the
crowd
beneath
from
a
gallery
corresponding
to
that
from
which
the
girl
was
looking
of
the
procession
nothing
was
at
present
to
be
seen
they
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
colour
somewhere
to
the
east
of
the
abbey
as
they
turned
off
opposite
westminster
hall
and
already
the
cry
of
the
trumpets
and
the
increasing
noise
of
a
crowd
out
of
sight
told
the
listeners
that
they
would
not
have
long
to
wait
beneath
the
crowd
was
arranging
itself
with
admirable
discipline
dispersing
in
long
lines
two
or
three
deep
against
the
walls
so
as
to
leave
a
good
space
and
laughing
at
a
couple
of
officious
persons
in
livery
who
had
suddenly
made
their
appearance
and
then
as
the
country
girl
herself
smiled
down
an
exclamation
from
alice
made
her
turn
at
first
it
was
difficult
to
discern
anything
clearly
in
the
stream
whose
head
began
to
discharge
itself
round
the
curve
from
the
left
a
row
of
uniforms
moving
four
abreast
came
first
visible
above
the
tossing
heads
of
horses
then
followed
a
group
of
guards
whose
steel
caps
passed
suddenly
into
the
sunlight
that
caught
them
from
between
the
houses
and
went
again
into
shadow
and
then
at
last
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
carriage
followed
by
ladies
on
grey
horses
and
forgot
all
the
rest
this
way
and
that
she
craned
her
head
gripping
the
oak
post
by
which
she
leaned
unconscious
of
all
except
that
she
was
to
see
her
in
whom
england
itself
seemed
to
have
been
incarnated
the
woman
who
as
perhaps
no
other
earthly
sovereign
in
the
world
at
that
time
or
before
her
had
her
people
in
a
grasp
that
was
not
one
of
merely
regal
power
even
far
away
in
derbyshire
even
in
the
little
country
manor
from
which
the
girl
came
the
aroma
of
that
tremendous
presence
penetrated
of
the
woman
whom
men
loved
to
hail
as
the
virgin
queen
even
though
they
might
question
her
virginity
the
woman
our
eliza
as
the
priest
had
named
her
just
now
who
had
made
so
shrewd
an
act
of
faith
in
her
people
that
they
had
responded
with
an
unreserved
act
of
love
it
was
this
woman
then
whom
she
was
about
to
see
the
sister
of
mary
and
edward
the
daughter
of
henry
and
anne
boleyn
who
had
received
her
kingdom
catholic
and
by
her
own
mere
might
had
chosen
to
make
it
protestant
the
woman
whose
anointed
hands
were
already
red
in
the
blood
of
servants
yet
hands
which
men
fainted
as
they
kissed
then
on
a
sudden
as
elizabeth
lifted
her
head
this
side
and
that
the
girl
saw
her
she
was
sitting
in
a
low
carriage
raised
on
cushions
alone
four
tall
horses
drew
her
at
a
slow
trot
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
were
deep
in
mud
since
she
had
driven
for
an
hour
over
the
deep
december
roads
but
this
added
rather
to
the
splendour
within
but
of
this
marjorie
remembered
no
more
than
an
uncertain
glimpse
the
air
was
thick
with
cries
from
window
after
window
waved
hands
and
more
than
all
the
loyalty
was
real
and
filled
the
air
like
brave
music
there
then
she
sat
smiling
she
was
dressed
in
some
splendid
stuff
jewels
sparkled
beneath
her
throat
once
a
hand
in
an
embroidered
glove
rose
to
wave
an
answer
to
the
roar
of
salute
and
as
the
carriage
came
beneath
she
raised
her
face
it
was
a
thin
face
sharply
ending
in
a
pointed
chin
a
tight
mouth
smiled
at
the
corners
above
her
narrow
eyes
and
high
brows
rose
a
high
forehead
surmounted
by
strands
of
auburn
hair
drawn
back
tightly
beneath
the
little
it
was
a
strangely
peaked
face
very
and
resembled
in
some
manner
a
mask
but
the
look
of
it
was
as
sharp
as
steel
like
a
slender
rapier
fragile
and
thin
yet
keen
enough
to
run
a
man
through
the
power
of
it
in
a
word
was
out
of
all
measure
with
the
slightness
of
the
face
then
the
face
dropped
and
marjorie
watched
the
back
of
the
head
bending
this
way
and
that
till
the
nodding
heads
that
followed
hid
it
from
sight
marjorie
drew
a
deep
breath
and
turned
the
faces
of
her
friends
were
as
pale
and
intent
as
her
own
only
the
priest
was
as
easy
as
ever
so
that
is
our
eliza
he
said
then
he
did
a
strange
thing
he
lifted
his
cap
once
more
with
grave
seriousness
god
save
her
grace
he
said
chapter
iv
i
robin
bowed
to
her
very
carefully
and
stood
upright
again
she
had
seen
in
an
instant
how
changed
he
was
in
that
swift
instant
in
which
her
eyes
had
singled
him
out
from
the
little
crowd
of
men
that
had
come
into
the
room
with
anthony
at
their
head
it
was
a
change
which
she
could
scarcely
have
put
into
words
unless
she
had
said
that
it
was
the
conception
of
the
levite
within
his
soul
he
was
dressed
soberly
and
richly
with
a
sword
at
his
side
in
great
splashed
to
the
knees
with
mud
with
his
cloak
thrown
back
and
he
carried
his
great
brimmed
hat
in
his
hand
all
this
was
as
it
might
have
been
in
derby
though
perhaps
his
dress
was
a
shade
more
dignified
than
that
in
which
she
had
ever
seen
him
but
the
change
was
in
his
face
and
bearing
he
bore
himself
like
a
man
and
a
restrained
man
and
there
was
besides
that
subtle
air
which
her
woman
eyes
could
see
but
which
even
her
woman
wit
could
not
properly
describe
she
made
room
for
him
to
sit
beside
her
and
then
father
campion
voice
spoke
these
are
the
gentlemen
then
he
said
and
two
more
are
not
yet
come
gentlemen
he
bowed
and
which
is
captain
fortescue
a
big
man
distinguished
from
the
rest
by
a
slightly
military
air
and
by
a
certain
vividness
of
costume
and
a
bristling
feather
in
his
hat
bowed
back
to
him
we
have
met
once
before
edmonds
he
said
at
valladolid
father
campion
smiled
yes
sir
for
five
or
ten
minutes
and
i
was
in
the
same
room
with
your
honour
once
at
the
duke
of
guise
and
now
sir
who
are
the
rest
of
your
company
the
others
were
named
one
by
one
and
marjorie
eyed
each
of
them
carefully
it
was
her
business
to
know
them
again
if
ever
they
should
meet
in
the
north
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
company
moved
here
and
there
bowing
and
saluting
and
taking
their
seats
there
were
still
a
couple
of
men
who
were
not
yet
come
but
these
two
arrived
a
few
minutes
later
and
it
was
not
until
she
had
said
a
word
or
two
to
them
all
and
father
campion
had
named
her
and
her
good
works
to
them
that
she
found
herself
back
again
with
robin
in
a
seat
a
little
apart
you
look
very
well
she
said
with
an
admirable
composure
his
eyes
twinkled
i
am
as
weary
as
a
man
can
be
he
said
we
have
ridden
since
before
dawn
and
you
and
your
good
works
marjorie
explained
describing
to
him
something
of
the
system
by
which
priests
were
safeguarded
now
in
the
north
the
districts
into
which
the
county
was
divided
and
the
apportioning
of
the
responsibilities
among
the
faithful
houses
it
was
her
business
she
said
to
receive
messages
and
to
pass
them
on
she
had
entertained
perhaps
a
dozen
priests
since
the
summer
perhaps
she
would
entertain
him
too
one
day
she
said
the
ordeal
was
far
lighter
than
she
had
feared
it
would
be
there
was
a
strong
undercurrent
of
excitement
in
her
heart
flushing
her
cheeks
and
sparkling
in
her
eyes
yet
never
for
one
moment
was
she
even
tempted
to
forget
that
he
was
now
vowed
to
god
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
talked
with
him
in
the
spirit
of
that
place
where
there
is
neither
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
those
two
years
of
quiet
in
the
north
occupied
even
more
than
she
recognised
in
the
rearranging
of
her
relations
with
the
memory
of
this
young
man
had
done
their
work
she
still
kindled
at
his
presence
but
it
was
at
the
presence
of
one
who
had
undertaken
an
adventure
that
destroyed
altogether
her
old
relations
with
him
she
was
enkindled
even
more
by
the
sense
of
her
own
security
and
as
she
looked
at
him
by
the
sense
of
his
security
too
robin
was
gone
here
instead
was
young
audrey
seminary
student
who
even
in
a
court
of
law
could
swear
before
god
that
he
was
not
a
priest
nor
had
been
ordained
beyond
the
seas
so
they
sat
and
exchanged
news
she
told
him
of
the
rumours
of
his
father
that
had
come
to
her
from
time
to
time
he
would
be
a
magistrate
yet
it
was
said
so
hot
was
his
loyalty
even
her
grace
it
was
reported
had
vowed
she
wished
she
had
a
thousand
such
country
gentlemen
on
whose
faithfulness
she
could
depend
and
robin
gave
her
news
of
the
seminary
of
the
hours
of
rising
and
sleeping
of
the
sports
there
of
the
confessors
for
the
faith
who
came
and
went
of
allen
he
told
her
too
of
garlick
and
ludlam
he
often
had
talked
with
them
of
derbyshire
he
said
it
was
very
peaceful
and
very
stirring
too
to
sit
here
in
the
lighted
parlour
and
hear
and
give
the
news
while
the
company
gathered
round
anthony
and
father
campion
talked
in
low
voices
and
mistress
babington
placid
watched
them
and
listened
he
showed
her
too
maine
beads
which
she
had
given
him
so
long
ago
hung
in
a
little
packet
round
his
neck
more
than
once
as
they
talked
marjorie
found
herself
looking
at
ballard
or
as
he
was
called
here
captain
fortescue
it
was
he
who
seemed
the
leader
of
the
troop
and
indeed
as
robin
told
her
in
a
whisper
that
was
what
he
was
he
came
and
went
frequently
he
said
his
manner
and
his
carriage
were
reassuring
to
the
suspicious
he
appeared
perhaps
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
a
priest
he
was
a
big
man
as
has
been
said
and
he
had
a
frank
assured
way
with
him
he
was
leaning
forward
even
now
as
she
looked
at
him
and
seemed
laying
down
the
law
though
in
what
was
almost
a
whisper
father
campion
was
watching
him
too
she
noticed
and
what
she
had
learned
of
father
campion
in
the
last
few
hours
led
her
to
wonder
whether
there
was
not
something
of
doubtfulness
in
his
opinion
of
him
father
campion
suddenly
shook
his
head
sharply
i
am
not
of
that
view
at
all
he
said
i
and
once
more
his
voice
sank
so
low
as
to
be
inaudible
as
the
rest
leaned
closer
about
him
ii
anthony
babington
seemed
silent
and
even
a
little
displeased
when
half
an
hour
later
the
visitors
were
all
gone
downstairs
to
supper
three
or
four
of
them
were
to
sleep
in
the
house
the
rest
of
whom
robin
was
one
had
captain
fortescue
instructions
as
to
where
lodgings
were
prepared
but
the
whole
company
was
tired
out
with
the
long
ride
from
the
coast
and
would
be
seen
no
more
that
night
marjorie
knew
enough
of
the
divisions
of
opinion
among
catholics
and
of
babington
in
particular
to
have
a
general
view
as
to
why
her
companion
was
displeased
but
more
than
that
she
did
not
know
nor
what
point
in
particular
it
was
on
which
the
argument
had
run
the
one
party
of
babington
kind
held
that
catholics
were
morally
in
a
state
of
war
war
had
been
declared
upon
them
without
justification
by
the
secular
authorities
and
physical
instruments
including
pursuivants
and
the
rack
were
employed
against
them
then
why
should
not
they
too
employ
the
same
kind
of
instruments
if
they
could
in
return
the
second
party
held
that
a
religious
persecution
could
not
be
held
to
constitute
a
state
of
war
the
apostles
peter
and
paul
for
example
not
only
did
not
employ
the
arm
of
flesh
against
the
roman
empire
but
actually
repudiated
it
and
this
party
further
held
that
even
the
pope
bull
relieving
elizabeth
subjects
from
their
allegiance
did
so
only
in
an
interior
sense
in
such
a
manner
that
while
they
must
still
regard
her
personal
and
individual
rights
such
rights
as
any
human
being
possessed
they
were
not
bound
to
render
interior
loyalty
to
her
as
their
queen
and
need
not
for
example
though
they
were
not
forbidden
to
do
so
regard
it
as
a
duty
to
fight
for
her
in
the
event
let
us
say
of
an
armed
invasion
from
spain
there
then
was
the
situation
and
anthony
had
plainly
crossed
swords
this
evening
on
the
point
the
jesuit
is
too
simple
he
said
suddenly
as
he
strode
about
i
think
he
broke
off
his
sister
smiled
upon
him
placidly
you
are
too
hot
anthony
she
said
the
man
turned
sharply
towards
her
all
the
praying
in
the
world
he
said
has
not
saved
us
so
far
it
seems
to
me
time
perhaps
our
lord
would
not
have
us
saved
she
said
as
you
mean
it
iii
it
was
not
until
christmas
eve
that
marjorie
went
to
paul
for
all
that
it
was
so
close
but
the
days
were
taken
up
with
the
visitors
a
hundred
matters
had
to
be
arranged
for
it
was
decided
that
before
the
new
year
all
were
to
be
dispersed
captain
fortescue
and
robin
were
to
leave
again
for
the
continent
on
the
day
following
christmas
day
itself
marjorie
made
acquaintance
during
these
days
with
more
than
one
of
the
catholics
in
london
one
was
a
quiet
little
house
near
where
a
widow
had
three
or
four
sets
of
lodgings
occupied
frequently
by
priests
and
by
other
catholics
who
were
best
out
of
sight
and
it
was
here
that
mass
was
to
be
said
on
christmas
day
another
was
in
the
spanish
embassy
and
here
to
her
joy
she
looked
openly
upon
a
chapel
of
her
faith
and
from
the
gallery
adored
her
lord
in
the
tabernacle
but
even
this
was
accomplished
with
an
air
of
uneasiness
in
those
round
her
the
spanish
priest
who
took
them
in
walked
quickly
and
interrupted
them
before
they
were
done
and
seemed
glad
to
see
the
last
of
them
it
was
explained
to
marjorie
that
the
ambassador
did
not
wish
to
give
causeless
offence
to
the
protestant
court
and
now
on
christmas
eve
robin
anthony
and
the
two
ladies
entered
the
cathedral
as
dusk
was
falling
first
passing
through
the
over
the
wall
of
which
leaned
the
rows
of
houses
in
whose
windows
lights
were
beginning
to
burn
the
very
dimness
of
the
air
made
the
enormous
heights
of
the
great
church
more
impressive
before
them
stretched
the
long
nave
over
seven
hundred
feet
from
end
to
end
from
floor
to
roof
the
eye
travelled
up
the
bunches
of
slender
pillars
to
the
dark
ceiling
newly
restored
after
the
fire
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
tall
windows
on
either
side
and
the
clerestory
lights
above
glimmered
faintly
in
the
darkening
light
but
to
the
catholic
eyes
that
looked
on
it
the
desolation
was
more
apparent
than
the
splendour
there
were
plenty
of
people
here
indeed
groups
moved
up
and
down
talking
directing
themselves
more
and
more
towards
the
exits
as
the
night
was
coming
on
and
the
church
would
be
closed
presently
in
one
aisle
a
man
was
talking
aloud
as
if
lecturing
with
a
crowd
of
heads
about
him
in
another
a
number
of
soberly
dressed
men
were
putting
up
their
papers
and
ink
on
the
little
tables
that
stood
in
a
row
this
was
scriveners
corner
she
was
told
from
a
third
half
a
dozen
persons
were
dejectedly
moving
away
these
were
servants
that
had
waited
to
be
hired
but
the
soul
of
the
place
was
gone
when
they
came
out
into
the
transepts
anthony
stopped
them
with
a
gesture
while
a
couple
of
porters
carrying
boxes
on
their
heads
pushed
by
on
their
short
cut
through
the
cathedral
it
was
there
he
said
that
the
altars
stood
he
pointed
between
the
pillars
on
either
side
and
there
up
little
raised
steps
lay
the
floors
of
the
chapels
but
within
all
was
empty
except
for
a
tomb
or
two
some
tattered
colours
and
the
still
in
place
where
the
altars
had
stood
there
were
blank
spaces
of
wall
piled
up
in
one
such
place
were
rows
of
wooden
seats
set
there
for
want
of
room
opposite
the
entrance
to
the
choir
where
once
overhead
had
hung
the
great
rood
the
four
stood
and
looked
in
through
a
gap
which
the
masons
were
mending
in
the
high
wall
that
had
bricked
off
the
chancel
from
the
nave
on
either
side
as
of
old
still
rose
up
the
towering
carven
stalls
the
splendid
pavement
still
shone
beneath
refracting
back
from
its
surface
the
glimmer
of
light
from
the
stained
windows
above
but
the
head
of
the
body
was
gone
somewhere
beneath
the
deep
shadowed
altar
screen
they
could
make
out
an
erection
that
might
have
been
an
altar
only
they
knew
that
it
was
not
it
was
no
longer
the
stone
of
sacrifice
whence
the
smoke
of
the
mystical
calvary
ascended
day
by
day
it
was
the
table
and
no
more
where
bread
and
wine
were
eaten
and
drunk
in
memory
of
an
event
whose
deathless
energy
had
ceased
in
this
place
at
least
to
operate
yet
it
was
here
thought
marjorie
that
only
forty
years
ago
scarcely
more
than
twenty
years
before
she
was
born
on
this
very
night
the
great
church
had
hummed
and
vibrated
with
life
round
all
the
walls
had
sat
priests
each
in
his
place
and
beside
each
kneeled
a
penitent
making
ready
for
the
joy
of
bethlehem
once
again
wise
and
simple
shepherds
and
magi
yet
all
simple
before
the
baffling
and
entrancing
mystery
there
had
been
footsteps
and
voices
there
too
yet
of
men
who
were
busy
upon
their
father
affairs
in
their
father
house
and
not
upon
their
own
they
were
going
from
altar
to
altar
speaking
with
their
friends
at
court
and
here
opposite
where
she
stood
and
peeped
in
the
empty
cold
darkness
there
had
burned
lights
before
the
throne
of
him
who
had
made
heaven
and
earth
and
did
his
father
will
on
earth
as
it
was
done
in
heaven
forty
years
ago
the
life
of
this
church
was
rising
on
this
very
night
with
a
hum
as
of
an
approaching
multitude
from
hour
to
hour
brightening
and
quickening
as
it
came
up
to
the
glory
of
the
midnight
mass
the
crowded
church
alight
from
end
to
end
the
smell
of
bog
and
bay
in
the
air
soon
to
be
met
and
crowned
by
the
savour
of
and
the
world
of
spirit
too
quickened
about
them
and
the
angels
she
thought
came
down
from
heaven
as
men
up
from
the
city
round
about
to
greet
him
who
is
king
of
both
angels
and
men
and
now
in
this
new
england
the
church
empty
of
the
divine
presence
was
emptying
too
of
its
human
visitors
she
could
hear
great
doors
somewhere
crash
together
and
the
reverberation
roll
beneath
the
stone
vaulting
it
would
empty
soon
desolate
and
dark
and
so
it
would
be
all
night
why
did
not
the
very
stones
cry
out
mistress
alice
touched
her
on
the
arm
we
must
be
going
she
said
they
are
closing
the
church
iv
she
had
a
long
talk
with
robin
on
christmas
night
the
day
had
passed
making
strange
impressions
on
her
which
she
could
not
understand
partly
it
was
the
contrast
between
the
homely
associations
of
the
feast
begun
as
it
was
for
her
with
the
mass
before
dawn
the
room
at
the
top
of
the
widow
house
was
crowded
all
the
while
she
was
there
between
these
associations
and
the
unfamiliarity
of
the
place
she
had
felt
curiously
apart
from
all
that
she
saw
that
day
in
the
streets
the
patrolling
groups
the
singers
the
mummers
of
whom
companies
went
about
all
day
two
or
three
glimpses
of
important
city
festivities
the
garlands
that
decorated
many
of
the
houses
it
seemed
to
her
as
a
without
sense
or
meaning
since
the
heart
of
christmas
was
gone
partly
too
no
doubt
it
was
the
memory
of
a
former
christmas
three
years
ago
when
she
had
begun
to
understand
that
robin
loved
her
and
he
was
with
her
again
yet
all
that
he
had
stood
for
to
her
was
gone
and
another
significance
had
taken
its
place
he
was
nearer
to
her
heart
in
one
manner
though
utterly
removed
in
another
it
was
as
when
a
friend
was
dead
his
familiar
presence
is
gone
but
now
that
one
physical
barrier
is
vanished
his
presence
is
there
closer
than
ever
though
in
another
fashion
robin
had
come
in
to
sup
captain
fortescue
would
fetch
him
about
nine
and
the
two
were
to
ride
for
the
coast
before
dawn
the
four
sat
quiet
after
supper
speaking
in
subdued
voices
of
hopes
for
the
future
when
england
should
be
besieged
indeed
by
the
spiritual
forces
that
were
gathering
overseas
but
they
slipped
gradually
into
talk
of
the
past
and
of
derbyshire
and
of
rides
they
remembered
then
after
a
while
anthony
was
called
away
mistress
alice
moved
back
to
the
table
to
see
her
needlework
the
better
and
robin
and
marjorie
sat
together
by
the
fire
he
told
her
again
of
the
journey
from
rheims
of
the
inns
where
they
lodged
of
the
extraordinary
care
that
was
taken
even
in
that
catholic
land
that
no
rumour
of
the
nature
of
the
party
should
slip
out
lest
some
gossip
precede
them
or
even
follow
them
to
the
coast
of
england
they
carried
themselves
even
there
he
said
as
ordinary
gentlemen
travelling
together
two
of
them
were
supposed
to
be
lawyers
he
himself
passed
as
ballard
servant
they
heard
mass
when
they
could
in
the
larger
towns
but
even
then
not
all
together
the
landing
in
england
had
been
easier
he
said
than
he
had
thought
though
he
had
learned
afterwards
that
a
helpful
young
man
who
had
offered
to
show
him
to
an
inn
in
folkestone
and
in
whose
presence
ballard
had
taken
care
to
give
him
a
good
rating
for
dropping
a
bag
with
loud
oaths
was
a
informer
however
no
harm
was
done
ballard
admirable
bearing
and
his
oaths
in
particular
had
seemed
to
satisfy
the
young
man
and
he
had
troubled
them
no
more
marjorie
did
not
say
much
she
listened
with
a
fierce
attention
so
much
interested
that
she
was
scarcely
aware
of
her
own
interest
she
looked
up
half
betrayed
into
annoyance
when
a
placid
laugh
from
mistress
alice
at
the
table
showed
that
another
was
listening
too
she
too
then
had
to
give
her
news
and
to
receive
messages
for
the
derbyshire
folk
whom
robin
wished
to
greet
and
it
was
not
until
mistress
alice
slipped
out
of
the
room
that
she
uttered
a
word
of
what
she
had
been
hoping
all
day
she
might
have
an
opportunity
to
say
audrey
she
said
for
she
was
careful
to
use
this
form
of
address
i
wish
you
to
pray
for
me
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
he
was
silent
at
present
she
said
gathering
courage
my
duty
is
clear
i
must
be
at
home
for
my
mother
sake
if
for
nothing
else
and
as
i
told
you
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
do
something
for
priests
but
if
my
mother
died
yes
he
said
as
she
stopped
again
she
glanced
up
at
his
serious
face
half
in
shadow
and
half
in
light
so
familiar
and
yet
so
utterly
apart
from
the
boy
she
had
known
well
she
said
i
think
of
you
as
a
priest
already
and
i
can
speak
to
you
freely
well
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
too
shall
not
go
overseas
to
serve
god
better
you
mean
yes
a
dozen
or
more
are
gone
from
derbyshire
whose
names
i
know
some
are
gone
to
bruges
two
or
three
to
rome
two
or
three
more
to
spain
we
women
can
not
do
what
priests
can
but
at
least
we
can
serve
god
in
religion
she
looked
at
him
again
expecting
an
answer
she
saw
him
move
his
head
as
if
to
answer
then
he
smiled
suddenly
well
however
you
look
at
me
i
am
not
a
priest
you
had
best
speak
to
one
father
campion
or
another
but
and
i
will
pray
for
you
he
said
with
an
air
of
finality
then
mistress
alice
came
back
she
never
forgot
all
her
life
long
the
little
scene
that
took
place
when
captain
fortescue
came
in
with
babington
to
fetch
robin
away
yet
the
whole
of
its
vividness
rose
from
its
interior
significance
externally
here
was
a
quiet
parlour
two
ladies
for
the
girl
afterwards
seemed
to
see
herself
in
the
picture
stood
by
the
fireplace
mistress
alice
still
held
her
needlework
gathered
up
in
one
hand
and
her
spools
of
thread
and
a
lay
on
the
polished
table
and
the
two
gentlemen
for
captain
fortescue
would
not
sit
down
and
robin
had
risen
at
his
entrance
the
two
gentlemen
stood
by
it
they
were
not
in
their
boots
for
they
were
not
to
ride
till
morning
they
appeared
two
ordinary
gentlemen
each
and
robin
had
his
cloak
across
his
arm
anthony
babington
stood
in
the
shadow
by
the
door
and
beyond
him
the
girl
could
see
the
face
of
dick
who
had
come
up
to
say
again
to
his
old
master
that
was
all
four
men
and
two
ladies
none
raised
his
voice
none
made
a
gesture
the
home
party
spoke
of
the
journey
and
of
their
hopes
that
all
would
go
well
the
travellers
or
rather
the
leader
for
robin
spoke
not
one
word
good
or
bad
said
that
he
was
sure
it
would
be
so
there
was
not
of
the
difficulty
in
getting
out
of
england
as
of
getting
into
it
then
again
he
said
that
it
was
late
that
he
had
still
one
or
two
matters
to
arrange
that
they
must
be
out
of
london
as
soon
as
the
gates
opened
and
the
scene
ended
robin
bowed
to
the
two
ladies
precisely
and
courteously
making
no
difference
between
them
and
wheeled
and
went
out
and
she
saw
face
too
vanish
from
the
door
and
heard
the
voices
of
the
two
on
the
stairs
marjorie
returned
the
salute
of
ballard
longing
to
entreat
him
to
take
good
care
of
the
boy
yet
knowing
that
she
must
not
and
could
not
then
he
too
was
gone
with
anthony
to
see
him
downstairs
and
marjorie
without
a
word
went
straight
through
to
her
room
fearing
to
trust
her
own
voice
for
she
felt
that
her
heart
was
gone
with
them
yet
not
for
one
moment
did
even
her
sensitive
soul
distrust
any
more
the
nature
of
the
love
that
she
bore
to
the
lad
but
mistress
alice
sat
down
again
to
her
sewing
chapter
v
i
marjorie
was
sitting
in
her
mother
room
while
her
mother
slept
she
had
been
reading
aloud
from
a
bundle
of
letters
news
from
rheims
but
little
by
little
she
had
seen
sleep
come
down
on
her
mother
face
and
had
let
her
voice
trail
away
into
silence
and
so
she
sat
quiet
it
seemed
incredible
that
nearly
a
year
had
passed
since
her
visit
to
london
and
that
christmas
was
upon
them
again
yet
in
this
remote
country
place
there
was
little
to
make
time
run
slowly
the
wheeled
gently
through
the
courses
of
the
year
the
trees
put
on
their
green
robes
changed
them
for
russet
and
dropped
them
again
the
dogs
and
the
horses
grew
a
little
older
a
beast
died
now
and
again
and
others
were
born
the
faces
that
she
knew
servants
and
farmers
aged
imperceptibly
here
and
there
a
family
moved
away
and
another
into
its
place
an
old
man
died
and
his
son
succeeded
him
but
the
mother
and
sisters
lived
on
in
the
house
in
patriarchal
fashion
priests
came
and
went
again
unobserved
marjorie
went
to
the
sacraments
when
she
could
and
said
her
prayers
always
but
letters
came
more
frequently
than
ever
to
the
little
remote
manor
carried
now
by
some
now
left
by
strangers
now
presented
as
credentials
and
booth
edge
became
known
in
that
underworld
of
the
north
which
finds
no
record
in
history
as
a
safe
place
for
folks
in
trouble
for
their
faith
for
one
whole
month
in
the
summer
there
had
been
a
visitor
at
the
house
a
cousin
of
old
mr
manners
it
was
understood
and
except
for
the
catholics
in
the
place
not
a
soul
knew
him
for
a
priest
against
whom
the
hue
and
cry
still
raged
in
york
derbyshire
indeed
had
done
well
for
the
old
religion
man
after
man
went
in
these
years
southwards
and
was
heard
of
no
more
till
there
came
back
one
day
a
gentleman
riding
alone
or
with
his
servant
and
it
became
known
that
one
more
derbyshire
man
was
come
again
to
his
own
place
to
minister
to
god
people
ralph
sherwine
was
one
of
them
christopher
buxton
another
and
ludlam
and
garlick
it
was
rumoured
would
not
be
long
now
and
there
had
been
a
wonderful
cessation
of
trouble
too
not
a
priest
had
suffered
since
the
two
the
news
of
whose
death
she
had
heard
two
years
ago
marjorie
then
sitting
quiet
over
the
fire
that
burned
now
all
the
winter
in
her
mother
room
was
thinking
over
these
things
she
had
had
more
news
from
london
from
time
to
time
sent
on
to
her
chiefly
by
babington
though
none
had
come
to
her
since
the
summer
and
she
had
singled
out
in
particular
all
that
bore
upon
father
campion
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
hunt
was
hotter
every
month
yet
he
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
once
he
had
escaped
she
had
heard
through
the
quick
wit
of
a
who
had
pushed
him
suddenly
into
a
as
the
officers
actually
came
in
sight
so
that
he
came
out
all
mud
and
and
had
been
jeered
at
for
a
clumsy
lover
by
the
very
men
who
were
on
his
trail
marjorie
smiled
to
herself
as
she
nursed
her
knee
over
the
fire
and
remembered
his
gaiety
and
sharpness
robin
too
was
never
very
far
from
her
thoughts
in
some
manner
she
put
the
two
together
in
her
mind
she
wondered
whether
they
would
ever
travel
together
it
was
her
hope
that
her
old
friend
might
become
another
campion
himself
some
day
a
log
rolled
from
its
place
in
the
fire
scattering
sparks
she
stooped
to
put
it
back
glancing
first
at
the
bed
to
see
if
her
mother
were
disturbed
and
as
she
sat
back
again
she
heard
the
blowing
of
a
horse
and
a
man
voice
fierce
and
low
from
beyond
the
windows
bidding
the
beast
hold
himself
up
she
was
accustomed
now
to
such
arrivals
they
came
and
went
like
this
often
without
warning
it
was
her
business
to
look
at
any
credentials
they
bore
with
them
and
then
if
all
were
well
to
do
what
she
to
set
them
on
their
way
or
to
give
them
shelter
a
room
was
set
aside
now
in
the
further
wing
and
called
openly
and
freely
the
priest
room
so
great
was
their
security
she
got
up
from
her
seat
and
went
out
quickly
on
tiptoe
as
she
heard
a
door
open
and
close
beneath
her
in
the
house
running
over
in
her
mind
any
preparations
that
she
would
have
to
make
if
the
rider
were
one
that
needed
shelter
as
she
looked
down
the
staircase
she
saw
a
maid
there
who
had
run
out
from
the
buttery
talking
to
a
man
whom
she
thought
she
knew
then
he
lifted
his
face
and
she
saw
that
she
was
right
and
that
it
was
babington
she
came
down
reassured
and
smiling
but
her
breath
caught
in
her
throat
as
she
saw
his
face
she
told
the
maid
to
be
off
and
get
supper
ready
but
he
jerked
his
head
in
refusal
she
saw
that
he
could
hardly
speak
then
she
led
him
into
the
hall
taking
down
the
lantern
that
hung
in
the
passage
and
placing
it
on
the
table
but
her
hand
shook
in
spite
of
herself
tell
me
she
whispered
he
sat
down
heavily
on
a
bench
it
is
all
over
he
said
the
bloody
murderers
they
were
gibbeted
three
days
ago
the
girl
drew
a
long
steady
breath
all
her
heart
cried
robin
who
are
they
mr
babington
why
campion
and
sherwine
and
brian
they
were
taken
a
month
or
two
ago
i
had
heard
not
a
word
of
it
and
and
it
ended
three
days
ago
i
i
do
not
understand
the
man
struck
his
hand
heavily
on
the
long
table
against
which
he
leaned
he
appeared
one
flame
of
fury
courtesy
and
gentleness
were
all
gone
from
him
they
were
hanged
for
treason
i
tell
you
treason
campion
by
god
we
will
give
them
treason
if
they
will
have
it
so
all
seemed
gone
from
marjorie
except
the
white
splashed
face
that
stared
at
her
lighted
up
by
the
lantern
beside
him
glaring
from
the
background
of
darkness
it
was
not
robin
not
robin
yet
the
shocking
agony
of
her
face
broke
through
the
man
fury
and
he
stood
up
quickly
mistress
marjorie
he
said
forgive
me
i
am
like
a
madman
i
am
on
my
way
from
derby
where
the
news
came
to
me
this
afternoon
i
turned
aside
to
tell
you
they
say
the
truce
as
they
call
it
is
at
an
end
i
came
to
warn
you
you
must
be
careful
i
am
riding
for
london
my
men
are
in
the
valley
mistress
marjorie
she
waved
him
aside
the
blood
was
beginning
again
to
beat
swiftly
and
deafeningly
in
her
ears
and
the
word
came
back
i
i
was
shocked
she
said
you
must
pardon
me
is
it
certain
he
tore
out
a
bundle
of
papers
from
behind
his
cloak
detached
one
with
shaking
hands
and
thrust
it
before
her
she
sat
down
and
spread
it
on
the
table
but
his
voice
broke
in
and
interrupted
her
all
the
while
they
were
all
three
taken
together
in
the
summer
i
have
been
in
france
my
letters
never
reached
me
they
were
racked
continually
they
died
all
together
praying
for
the
queen
at
tyburn
campion
died
the
first
she
pushed
the
paper
from
her
the
close
handwriting
was
no
more
to
her
than
black
marks
on
the
paper
she
passed
her
hands
over
her
forehead
and
eyes
mistress
marjorie
you
look
like
death
see
i
will
leave
the
paper
with
you
it
is
from
one
of
my
friends
who
was
there
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
the
servant
came
in
bearing
a
tray
set
it
down
said
marjorie
as
coolly
as
if
death
and
horror
were
as
far
from
her
as
an
hour
ago
she
nodded
sharply
to
the
maid
who
went
out
again
then
she
rose
and
spread
the
food
within
the
man
reach
he
began
to
eat
and
drink
talking
all
the
time
as
she
sat
and
watched
him
and
listened
remembering
afterwards
as
if
mechanically
all
that
he
said
she
was
contemplating
something
else
she
seemed
to
see
campion
not
as
he
had
been
three
days
ago
not
as
he
was
now
but
as
she
had
seen
him
in
london
alert
brisk
quick
even
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
with
her
and
the
swift
merry
look
in
his
eyes
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
of
her
thought
there
hung
other
presences
the
darkness
the
blood
the
smoking
cauldron
oh
she
would
have
to
face
these
presently
she
would
go
through
this
night
she
knew
looking
at
all
their
terror
but
just
now
let
her
remember
him
as
he
had
been
let
her
keep
off
all
other
thoughts
so
long
as
she
could
ii
when
she
had
heard
the
horse
footsteps
scramble
down
the
little
steep
ascent
in
the
dark
and
then
pass
into
silence
on
the
turf
beyond
she
closed
the
outer
door
barred
it
once
more
and
then
went
back
straight
into
the
hall
where
the
lantern
still
burned
among
the
plates
she
dared
not
face
her
mother
yet
she
must
learn
how
far
she
still
held
control
of
herself
for
her
mother
must
not
hear
the
news
the
apothecary
from
derby
who
had
ridden
up
to
see
her
this
week
had
been
very
emphatic
so
the
girl
must
be
as
usual
there
must
be
no
sign
of
discomposure
at
least
she
would
keep
her
face
in
the
shadow
but
her
voice
could
she
control
that
too
after
she
had
sat
motionless
in
the
cold
hall
a
minute
or
two
she
tested
herself
he
is
dead
she
said
softly
he
is
quite
dead
and
so
are
the
others
they
but
she
could
not
go
on
great
shuddering
seized
on
her
she
shook
from
head
to
foot
later
that
night
mrs
manners
awoke
she
tried
to
move
her
head
but
the
pain
was
shocking
and
still
half
asleep
she
moaned
aloud
then
the
curtains
moved
softly
and
she
could
see
that
a
face
was
looking
at
her
margy
is
that
you
yes
mother
move
my
head
move
my
head
i
can
not
bear
she
felt
herself
lifted
gently
and
strongly
the
struggle
and
the
pain
exhausted
her
for
a
minute
and
she
lay
breathing
deeply
then
the
ease
of
the
shifted
position
soothed
her
i
can
not
see
your
face
she
said
where
is
the
light
the
face
disappeared
and
immediately
through
the
curtains
the
mother
saw
the
light
but
still
she
could
not
see
the
girl
face
she
said
so
peevishly
it
will
weary
your
eyes
lie
still
mother
and
go
to
sleep
again
what
time
is
it
i
do
not
know
are
you
not
in
bed
not
yet
mother
the
sick
woman
moaned
again
once
or
twice
but
thought
no
more
of
it
and
presently
the
deep
sleep
of
sickness
came
down
on
her
again
they
rose
early
in
those
days
in
england
and
soon
after
six
as
janet
had
seen
nothing
of
her
young
mistress
she
opened
the
door
of
the
and
peeped
in
a
minute
later
marjorie
mind
rose
up
out
of
black
gulfs
of
sleep
in
which
since
her
falling
asleep
an
hour
or
two
ago
she
had
wandered
bearing
an
intolerable
burden
which
she
could
neither
see
nor
let
fall
to
find
the
face
of
janet
all
pinched
with
cold
peering
into
her
own
she
sat
up
wide
awake
yet
with
all
her
world
still
swaying
about
her
and
stared
into
her
eyes
what
is
it
what
time
is
it
it
is
after
six
mistress
and
the
mistress
seems
uneasy
i
marjorie
sprang
up
and
went
to
the
bed
iii
on
the
evening
of
that
day
her
mother
died
there
was
no
priest
within
reach
a
couple
of
men
had
ridden
out
early
dispatched
by
marjorie
within
half
an
hour
of
her
awaking
to
dethick
to
hathersage
and
to
every
spot
within
twenty
miles
where
a
priest
might
be
found
with
orders
not
to
return
without
one
but
the
long
day
had
dragged
out
and
when
dusk
was
falling
still
neither
had
come
back
the
country
was
and
all
but
impassable
she
learned
later
across
valley
after
valley
where
the
streams
had
risen
and
nowhere
could
news
be
gained
that
any
priest
was
near
for
as
a
further
difficulty
open
inquiry
was
not
always
possible
in
view
of
the
news
that
had
come
to
booth
edge
last
night
the
girl
had
understood
that
the
embers
were
rising
again
to
flame
in
the
south
and
who
could
tell
but
that
a
careless
word
might
kindle
the
fire
here
too
she
had
been
urged
by
anthony
to
hold
herself
more
careful
than
ever
and
she
had
been
compelled
to
warn
her
messengers
it
was
soon
after
dusk
had
fallen
the
heavy
dusk
of
a
december
day
that
her
mother
had
come
back
again
to
consciousness
she
opened
her
eyes
wearily
coming
back
as
marjorie
had
herself
that
morning
from
that
strange
realm
of
heavy
and
deathly
sleep
to
the
pale
phantom
world
called
life
and
agonising
pain
about
the
heart
stabbed
her
wide
awake
o
jesu
she
screamed
then
she
heard
her
daughter
voice
very
steady
and
plain
in
her
ear
there
is
no
priest
mother
dear
listen
to
me
i
can
not
i
can
not
jesu
her
eyes
closed
again
for
torment
and
the
sweat
ran
down
her
face
the
slow
poison
that
had
weighted
and
soaked
her
limbs
so
gradually
these
many
months
past
was
closing
in
at
last
upon
her
heart
and
her
pain
was
gathering
to
its
last
assault
the
silent
humorous
woman
was
changed
into
one
twitching
uncontrolled
incarnation
of
torture
then
again
the
voice
began
jesu
who
didst
die
for
love
of
me
upon
the
cross
let
me
die
for
love
of
thee
christ
moaned
the
woman
more
softly
say
it
in
your
heart
after
me
there
is
no
priest
so
god
will
accept
your
sorrow
instead
now
then
then
the
old
words
began
the
old
acts
of
sorrow
and
love
and
faith
and
hope
that
mother
and
daughter
had
said
together
night
after
night
for
so
many
years
over
and
over
again
they
came
whispered
clear
and
sharp
by
the
voice
in
her
ear
and
she
strove
to
follow
them
now
and
again
the
pain
closed
its
sharp
hands
upon
her
heart
so
cruelly
that
all
that
on
which
she
strove
to
fix
her
mind
fled
from
her
like
a
mist
and
she
moaned
or
screamed
or
was
silent
with
her
teeth
clenched
upon
her
lip
my
god
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
have
offended
thee
why
is
there
no
priest
where
is
the
priest
mother
dear
listen
i
have
sent
for
a
priest
but
none
has
come
you
remember
now
you
remember
that
priests
are
forbidden
now
where
is
the
priest
mother
dear
three
priests
were
put
to
death
only
three
days
ago
in
london
for
for
being
priests
ask
them
to
pray
for
you
say
edmund
campion
pray
for
me
perhaps
perhaps
the
girl
voice
died
away
for
for
a
full
minute
an
extraordinary
sensation
rested
on
her
it
began
with
a
sudden
shiver
of
the
flesh
as
sharp
and
tingling
as
water
dying
away
in
long
thrills
amid
her
hair
that
strange
advertisement
that
tells
the
flesh
that
more
than
flesh
is
there
and
that
the
world
of
spirit
is
not
only
present
but
alive
and
energetic
then
as
it
passed
the
whole
world
too
passed
into
silence
the
curtains
that
shook
just
now
hung
rigid
as
sheets
of
steel
the
woman
in
the
bed
lay
suddenly
still
then
smiled
with
closed
eyes
the
pair
of
maids
kneeling
out
of
sight
beyond
the
bed
ceased
to
sob
and
while
the
seconds
went
by
as
real
as
any
knowledge
can
be
in
which
the
senses
have
no
part
the
certain
knowledge
deepened
upon
the
girl
who
knelt
arrested
in
spite
of
herself
that
a
priestly
presence
was
here
indeed
very
slowly
as
if
lifting
great
weights
she
raised
her
eyes
knowing
that
there
across
the
tumbled
bed
where
the
darkness
of
the
room
showed
between
the
parted
curtains
the
presence
was
poised
yet
there
was
nothing
there
to
see
no
tortured
throttling
face
ah
that
could
not
be
but
neither
was
there
the
merry
kindly
face
with
large
cheerful
eyes
and
tender
mouth
smiling
no
hand
held
the
curtains
that
the
face
might
peer
in
neither
then
nor
at
any
time
in
all
her
life
did
marjorie
believe
that
she
saw
him
yet
neither
then
nor
in
all
her
life
did
she
doubt
he
had
been
there
while
her
mother
died
again
her
mother
smiled
and
this
time
she
opened
her
eyes
to
the
full
and
there
was
no
dismay
in
them
nor
fear
nor
disappointment
and
she
looked
a
little
to
her
left
where
the
parted
curtains
showed
the
darkness
of
the
room
then
marjorie
closed
her
eyes
and
laid
her
head
on
the
bed
where
her
mother
body
sank
back
and
down
into
the
pillows
then
the
girl
slipped
heavily
to
the
floor
and
the
maids
sprang
up
screaming
iv
it
was
not
till
two
hours
later
that
simpson
arrived
he
had
been
found
at
last
at
hathersage
only
a
few
miles
away
as
one
of
the
men
on
his
return
ride
had
made
one
last
inquiry
before
coming
home
and
there
he
ran
into
the
priest
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
street
the
priest
had
taken
the
man
horse
and
pushed
on
as
well
as
he
could
through
the
dark
in
the
hopes
he
might
yet
be
in
time
marjorie
came
to
him
in
the
parlour
downstairs
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
and
gravely
it
is
over
she
said
and
sat
down
and
there
was
no
priest
she
said
nothing
she
was
in
her
with
the
hood
drawn
over
her
head
as
it
was
a
cold
night
he
was
amazed
at
her
look
of
he
had
thought
to
find
her
either
collapsed
or
strainedly
tragic
he
had
wondered
as
he
came
how
he
would
speak
to
her
how
he
would
soothe
her
and
he
saw
there
was
no
need
she
told
him
presently
of
the
sudden
turn
for
the
worse
early
that
morning
as
she
herself
fell
asleep
by
the
bedside
and
a
little
of
what
had
passed
during
the
day
then
she
stopped
short
as
she
approached
the
end
have
you
heard
the
news
from
london
she
said
i
mean
of
our
priests
there
his
young
face
grew
troubled
and
he
knit
his
forehead
they
are
in
ward
he
said
i
heard
a
week
ago
they
will
banish
them
from
england
they
dare
not
do
more
it
is
all
finished
she
said
quietly
what
they
were
hanged
at
tyburn
three
days
ago
the
three
of
them
together
he
drew
a
hissing
breath
and
felt
the
skin
of
his
face
tingle
you
have
heard
that
babington
came
to
tell
me
last
night
he
left
a
paper
with
me
i
have
not
read
it
yet
he
watched
her
as
she
drew
it
out
and
put
it
before
him
the
terror
was
on
him
as
once
or
twice
before
in
his
journeyings
or
as
when
the
news
of
nelson
death
had
reached
him
a
terror
which
shamed
him
to
the
heart
and
which
he
loathed
yet
could
not
overcome
he
still
stared
into
her
pale
face
then
he
took
the
paper
and
began
to
read
it
presently
he
laid
it
down
again
the
sick
terror
was
beginning
to
pass
or
rather
he
was
able
to
grip
it
and
he
said
a
conventional
word
or
two
he
could
do
no
more
there
was
no
exultation
in
his
heart
nothing
but
misery
and
then
in
despair
he
left
the
subject
and
you
mistress
he
said
what
will
you
do
now
have
you
no
aunt
or
friend
mistress
alice
babington
once
said
she
would
come
and
live
with
me
if
when
i
needed
it
i
shall
write
to
her
i
do
not
know
what
else
to
do
and
you
will
live
here
why
more
than
ever
she
said
smiling
suddenly
i
can
work
in
earnest
now
chapter
vi
i
it
was
on
a
bright
evening
in
the
summer
that
marjorie
with
her
maid
janet
came
riding
down
to
padley
and
about
the
same
time
a
young
man
came
walking
up
the
track
that
led
from
derby
in
fact
the
young
man
saw
the
two
against
the
skyline
and
wondered
who
they
were
further
there
was
a
group
of
four
or
five
walking
on
the
terrace
below
the
house
that
saw
both
the
approaching
parties
and
commented
upon
their
coming
to
be
precise
there
were
four
persons
in
the
group
on
the
terrace
and
a
who
hung
near
the
four
were
john
fitzherbert
his
son
thomas
his
son
wife
and
in
the
midst
leaning
on
arm
was
old
sir
thomas
himself
and
it
was
for
his
sake
that
the
servant
was
within
call
for
he
was
still
very
sickly
after
his
long
imprisonment
in
spite
of
his
occasional
releases
john
saw
the
visitors
first
why
here
is
the
company
all
arrived
together
he
said
now
if
anything
hung
on
that
his
son
broke
in
uneasily
you
are
sure
of
young
owen
he
said
our
lives
will
all
hang
on
him
after
this
his
father
clapped
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
now
now
he
said
i
know
him
well
enough
from
my
lord
he
hath
made
a
dozen
such
places
in
this
county
alone
thomas
glanced
swiftly
at
his
uncle
and
you
have
spoken
with
him
too
uncle
the
old
man
turned
his
melancholy
eyes
on
him
yes
i
have
spoken
with
him
he
said
five
minutes
later
marjorie
was
dismounted
and
was
with
him
she
greeted
old
sir
thomas
with
particular
respect
she
had
talked
with
him
a
year
ago
when
he
was
first
released
that
he
might
raise
his
fines
and
she
knew
well
enough
that
his
liberty
was
coming
to
an
end
in
fact
he
was
technically
a
prisoner
even
now
and
had
only
been
allowed
to
come
for
a
week
or
two
from
sir
walter
aston
house
before
going
back
again
to
the
fleet
you
are
come
in
good
time
said
sir
john
smiling
that
is
young
owen
himself
coming
up
the
path
there
was
nothing
particularly
noticeable
about
the
young
man
who
a
minute
later
was
standing
before
them
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
he
was
plainly
of
the
working
class
and
he
had
over
his
shoulder
a
bag
of
tools
he
was
dusty
up
to
the
knees
with
his
long
tramp
john
gave
him
a
word
of
welcome
and
then
the
whole
group
went
slowly
together
back
to
the
house
with
the
two
men
following
sir
thomas
stumbled
a
little
going
up
the
two
or
three
steps
into
the
hall
then
they
all
sat
down
together
the
servant
put
a
big
flagon
and
a
horn
tumbler
beside
the
traveller
and
went
out
closing
the
doors
now
my
man
said
john
do
you
eat
and
drink
while
i
do
the
talking
i
understand
you
are
a
man
of
your
hands
and
that
you
have
business
elsewhere
i
must
be
in
lancashire
by
the
end
of
the
week
sir
very
well
then
we
have
business
enough
for
you
god
knows
this
is
mistress
manners
whom
you
may
have
heard
of
and
after
you
have
looked
at
the
places
we
have
here
you
understand
me
mistress
manners
wants
you
at
her
house
at
booth
edge
you
have
any
papers
owen
leaned
back
and
drew
out
a
paper
from
his
bag
of
tools
this
is
from
fenton
sir
john
glanced
at
the
address
then
he
turned
it
over
and
broke
the
seal
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
open
sheet
why
it
is
blank
he
said
owen
smiled
he
was
a
lad
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
old
and
his
face
lighted
up
very
pleasantly
i
have
had
that
trick
played
on
me
before
sir
in
my
travels
i
understand
that
catholic
gentlemen
do
so
sometimes
to
try
the
fidelity
of
the
messenger
the
other
laughed
out
loud
throwing
back
his
head
why
that
is
a
poor
compliment
he
said
you
shall
have
a
better
one
from
us
i
have
no
doubt
thomas
leaned
over
the
table
and
took
the
paper
he
examined
it
very
carefully
then
he
handed
it
back
his
father
laughed
again
as
he
took
it
you
are
very
cautious
my
son
he
said
but
it
is
wise
enough
well
then
he
went
on
to
the
carpenter
you
are
willing
to
do
this
work
for
us
and
as
for
payment
i
ask
only
my
food
and
lodging
said
the
lad
quietly
and
enough
to
carry
me
on
to
the
next
place
why
began
the
other
in
a
protest
no
sir
no
more
than
that
he
paused
an
instant
i
hope
to
be
admitted
to
the
society
of
jesus
this
year
or
next
there
was
a
pause
of
astonishment
and
then
old
sir
thomas
deep
voice
broke
in
you
do
very
well
sir
i
heartily
congratulate
you
and
i
would
i
were
twenty
years
younger
myself
ii
after
supper
that
night
the
entire
party
went
upstairs
to
the
chapel
young
hugh
owen
even
already
was
beginning
to
be
known
among
catholics
for
his
extraordinary
skill
in
constructing
up
to
the
present
not
much
more
had
been
attempted
than
little
secret
recesses
where
the
vessels
of
the
altar
and
the
vestments
might
be
concealed
but
the
young
carpenter
had
been
ingenious
enough
in
two
or
three
houses
to
which
he
had
been
called
to
enlarge
these
so
considerably
that
even
two
or
three
men
might
be
sheltered
in
them
and
now
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
persecution
of
recusants
was
to
break
out
again
the
idea
began
to
spread
john
fitzherbert
while
in
london
had
heard
of
his
skill
and
had
taken
means
to
get
at
the
young
man
for
his
own
house
at
padley
owen
was
already
at
work
when
the
party
came
upstairs
he
had
supped
alone
and
with
a
servant
to
guide
him
had
made
the
round
of
the
house
taking
measurements
in
every
possible
place
he
was
seated
on
the
floor
as
they
came
in
three
or
four
panels
lay
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
a
heap
of
plaster
and
stones
he
looked
up
as
they
came
in
this
will
take
me
all
night
sir
he
said
and
the
fire
must
be
put
out
below
he
explained
his
plan
the
old
was
but
a
poor
affair
it
consisted
of
a
space
large
enough
for
only
one
man
and
was
contrived
by
a
section
of
the
wall
having
been
removed
all
but
the
outer
row
of
stones
made
thin
for
the
purpose
the
entrance
to
it
was
through
a
tall
sliding
panel
on
the
inside
of
the
chapel
its
extreme
weakness
as
a
lay
in
the
fact
that
anyone
striking
on
the
panel
could
not
fail
to
hear
how
hollow
it
rang
this
he
proposed
to
do
away
with
unless
indeed
he
left
a
small
space
for
the
altar
vessels
and
to
construct
instead
a
little
chamber
in
the
chimney
of
the
hall
that
was
built
against
this
wall
he
would
contrive
it
so
that
an
entrance
was
still
from
the
chapel
as
well
as
one
that
he
would
make
over
the
hearth
below
and
that
the
smoke
should
be
conducted
round
the
little
enclosed
space
passing
afterwards
up
the
usual
vent
the
chamber
would
be
large
enough
he
thought
for
at
least
two
men
he
explained
too
his
method
of
deadening
the
hollowness
of
the
sound
if
the
panel
were
knocked
upon
by
placing
pads
of
felt
on
struts
of
wood
that
would
be
set
against
the
why
that
is
very
shrewd
cried
john
he
looked
round
the
faces
for
approval
for
an
hour
or
so
the
party
sat
and
watched
him
at
his
work
and
marjorie
listened
to
their
talk
it
was
of
that
which
filled
the
hearts
of
all
catholics
at
this
time
of
the
gathering
storm
in
england
of
the
priests
that
had
been
executed
this
very
year
paine
at
chelmsford
in
march
forde
shert
and
johnson
at
tyburn
in
may
the
first
of
the
three
having
been
taken
with
father
campion
at
lyford
deaths
that
were
followed
two
days
later
by
the
execution
of
four
more
one
of
whom
filbie
had
also
been
arrested
at
lyford
and
there
were
besides
a
great
number
more
in
prison
cottam
it
was
known
had
been
taken
at
york
scarcely
a
week
ago
and
it
was
said
would
certainly
suffer
before
long
they
talked
in
low
voices
for
the
shadow
was
on
all
their
hearts
it
had
been
possible
almost
to
this
very
year
to
hope
that
the
misery
would
be
a
passing
one
but
the
time
for
hope
was
gone
it
remained
only
to
bear
what
came
to
multiply
priests
and
if
necessary
martyrs
and
meantime
to
take
such
pains
for
protection
as
they
could
he
will
be
a
clever
pursuivant
who
finds
this
one
out
said
john
the
carpenter
looked
up
from
his
work
but
a
clever
one
will
find
it
he
said
thomas
was
heard
to
sigh
iii
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
that
marjorie
rode
up
to
her
house
with
janet
beside
her
and
hugh
owen
walking
by
her
horse
he
had
finished
his
work
at
padley
an
hour
or
two
after
dawn
for
he
worked
at
night
when
he
could
and
had
then
gone
to
rest
but
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
when
her
horses
were
brought
and
asked
if
he
might
walk
with
her
he
had
asked
it
simply
and
easily
saying
that
it
might
save
his
losing
his
way
and
time
was
precious
to
him
marjorie
felt
very
much
interested
by
this
lad
for
he
was
no
more
than
that
in
appearance
he
was
like
any
of
his
kind
with
a
face
in
a
she
might
have
seen
him
by
chance
a
hundred
times
and
not
known
him
again
but
his
manner
was
remarkable
so
wholly
simple
and
he
was
courteous
always
as
suited
his
degree
but
he
had
something
of
the
same
assurance
that
she
had
noticed
so
plainly
in
father
campion
he
talked
with
a
plain
northern
dialect
presently
she
opened
on
that
very
point
for
she
could
talk
freely
before
janet
did
you
ever
know
father
campion
she
asked
i
have
never
spoken
with
him
mistress
i
have
heard
him
preach
it
was
that
which
put
it
in
my
heart
to
join
the
company
you
heard
him
preach
yes
mistress
three
or
four
times
in
essex
and
hertfordshire
i
heard
him
preach
upon
the
young
man
who
came
to
our
saviour
tell
me
she
said
looking
down
at
what
she
could
see
of
his
face
it
was
liker
an
angel
than
a
man
he
said
quietly
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
him
from
his
first
word
to
the
last
and
all
were
the
same
that
were
there
was
he
eloquent
aye
you
might
call
it
that
but
i
thought
it
to
be
the
spirit
of
god
and
it
was
then
you
made
up
your
mind
to
join
the
society
there
was
no
rest
for
me
till
i
did
christ
also
went
away
sorrowful
were
his
last
words
and
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
marjorie
was
silent
through
pure
sympathy
this
young
man
spoke
a
language
she
understood
better
than
that
which
some
of
her
friends
used
babington
for
instance
it
was
the
person
of
jesus
christ
that
was
all
her
religion
to
her
it
was
for
this
that
she
was
devout
that
she
went
to
mass
and
the
sacraments
when
she
could
it
was
this
that
made
mary
dear
to
her
was
he
not
her
son
and
above
all
it
was
for
this
that
she
had
sacrificed
robin
she
could
not
bear
that
he
should
not
serve
him
as
a
priest
if
he
might
but
the
other
talk
that
she
had
heard
sometimes
of
the
place
of
religion
in
politics
and
the
justification
of
this
or
that
course
of
public
action
well
she
knew
that
these
things
must
be
so
yet
it
was
not
the
manner
of
her
own
most
intimate
thought
and
the
language
of
it
was
not
hers
the
two
went
together
so
a
few
paces
without
speaking
then
she
had
a
sudden
impulse
and
do
you
ever
think
of
what
may
come
upon
you
she
asked
do
you
ever
think
of
the
end
aye
he
said
and
what
do
you
think
the
end
will
be
she
saw
him
raise
his
eyes
to
her
an
instant
i
think
he
said
that
i
shall
die
for
my
faith
some
day
that
same
strange
shiver
that
passed
over
her
at
her
mother
bedside
passed
over
her
again
as
if
material
things
grew
thin
about
her
there
was
a
tone
in
his
voice
that
made
it
absolutely
clear
to
her
that
he
was
not
speaking
of
a
fancy
but
of
some
certain
knowledge
that
he
had
yet
she
dared
not
ask
him
and
she
was
a
woman
before
the
news
came
to
her
of
his
death
upon
the
rack
iv
it
was
a
young
man
that
came
into
the
kitchen
early
next
morning
where
the
ladies
and
the
maids
were
hard
at
work
all
together
upon
the
business
of
baking
the
baking
was
a
considerable
task
each
week
for
there
were
not
less
than
twenty
mouths
all
told
to
feed
in
the
hall
day
by
day
including
a
widow
or
two
that
called
each
day
for
rations
and
a
great
part
therefore
of
a
mistress
time
in
such
houses
was
taken
up
with
such
things
marjorie
turned
to
him
with
her
arms
floured
to
the
elbow
well
she
said
smiling
i
have
done
mistress
will
it
please
you
to
see
it
before
i
go
and
sleep
they
had
examined
the
house
carefully
last
night
measuring
and
sounding
in
the
deep
and
thin
walls
alike
for
there
was
at
present
no
convenience
at
all
for
a
hunted
man
owen
had
obtained
her
consent
to
two
or
three
alternative
proposals
and
she
had
then
left
him
to
himself
from
her
bed
that
she
had
had
prepared
with
alice
babington
in
a
loft
turning
out
for
the
night
the
who
had
usually
slept
there
she
had
heard
more
than
once
the
sound
of
distant
hammering
from
the
main
front
of
the
house
where
her
own
room
lay
that
had
been
once
her
mother
as
well
the
possibilities
in
this
little
manor
were
small
to
construct
a
passage
giving
an
exterior
escape
as
had
been
made
in
some
houses
would
have
meant
here
a
labour
of
weeks
and
she
had
told
the
young
man
she
would
be
content
with
a
simple
yet
although
she
did
not
expect
great
things
and
knew
moreover
the
kind
of
place
that
he
would
make
she
was
as
excited
as
a
child
in
a
grave
sort
of
way
at
what
she
would
see
he
took
her
first
into
the
parlour
where
years
ago
robin
had
talked
with
her
in
the
wintry
sunshine
the
open
chimney
was
on
the
right
as
they
entered
and
though
she
knew
that
somewhere
on
that
same
side
would
be
one
of
the
two
entrances
that
had
been
arranged
all
the
difference
she
could
see
was
that
a
piece
of
the
that
had
been
between
the
window
and
the
fire
was
gone
and
that
there
hung
in
its
place
an
old
picture
painted
on
a
panel
she
looked
at
this
without
speaking
the
wall
was
wainscoted
in
oak
as
it
had
always
been
six
feet
up
from
the
floor
then
an
idea
came
to
her
she
tilted
the
picture
on
one
side
but
there
was
no
more
to
be
seen
than
a
cracked
panel
which
it
seemed
to
her
had
once
been
nearer
the
door
she
rapped
upon
this
but
it
gave
back
the
dull
sound
as
of
wood
against
stone
she
turned
to
the
young
man
smiling
he
smiled
back
come
into
the
bedroom
mistress
he
led
her
in
there
through
the
passage
outside
into
which
the
two
doors
opened
at
the
head
of
the
outside
stairs
but
here
too
all
that
she
could
see
was
that
a
tall
press
that
had
once
stood
between
the
windows
now
stood
against
the
wall
immediately
opposite
to
the
painted
panel
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
she
opened
the
doors
of
the
press
but
it
was
as
it
had
always
been
there
even
hung
there
the
three
or
four
dresses
that
she
had
taken
from
it
last
night
and
laid
on
the
bed
she
laughed
outright
and
turning
saw
mistress
alice
babington
beaming
tranquilly
from
the
door
of
the
room
come
in
alice
she
said
and
see
this
miracle
then
he
began
to
explain
it
on
this
side
was
the
entrance
proper
and
as
he
said
so
he
stepped
up
into
the
press
and
closed
the
doors
they
could
hear
him
fumbling
within
then
the
sound
of
wood
sliding
and
finally
a
muffled
voice
calling
to
them
marjorie
flung
the
doors
open
and
save
for
the
dresses
it
was
empty
she
stared
in
for
a
moment
still
hearing
the
movements
of
someone
beyond
and
at
last
the
sound
of
a
snap
and
as
she
withdrew
her
head
to
exclaim
to
alice
the
young
man
walked
into
the
room
through
the
open
door
behind
her
then
he
explained
it
in
full
the
back
of
the
press
had
been
removed
and
then
replaced
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
slide
out
about
eighteen
inches
towards
the
window
but
only
when
the
doors
of
the
press
were
closed
when
they
were
opened
they
drew
out
simultaneously
a
slip
of
wood
on
either
side
that
pulled
the
sliding
door
tight
and
immovable
behind
the
back
of
the
press
thus
removed
a
corresponding
part
of
the
wainscot
slid
in
the
same
way
giving
a
narrow
doorway
into
the
cell
which
he
had
excavated
between
the
double
beams
of
the
thick
wall
next
when
the
person
that
had
taken
refuge
was
inside
with
the
two
sliding
doors
closed
behind
him
it
was
possible
for
him
by
an
extremely
simple
device
to
turn
a
wooden
button
and
thus
release
a
little
wooden
machinery
which
controlled
a
further
opening
into
the
parlour
and
which
at
the
same
time
was
braced
against
the
hollow
panelling
and
one
of
the
higher
beams
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
it
when
knocked
upon
the
dullness
of
sound
the
girl
had
noticed
just
now
but
this
door
could
only
be
opened
from
within
neither
a
fugitive
nor
a
pursuer
could
make
any
entrance
from
the
parlour
side
unless
the
wainscoting
itself
were
torn
off
lastly
the
crack
in
the
woodwork
corresponding
with
two
minute
holes
bored
in
the

marjorie
found
it
curious
even
to
herself
how
the
press
that
faced
the
foot
of
the
two
beds
where
she
and
alice
slept
side
by
side
became
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
thought
of
robin
and
she
began
to
perceive
that
it
was
largely
with
the
thought
of
him
in
her
intention
that
the
idea
had
first
presented
itself
of
having
the
cell
constructed
at
all
it
was
not
that
in
her
deliberate
mind
she
conceived
that
he
would
be
hunted
that
he
would
fly
here
that
she
would
save
him
but
rather
in
that
strange
realm
of
consciousness
which
is
called
sometimes
the
imagination
and
sometimes
by
other
names
that
inner
on
which
move
figures
cast
by
the
two
worlds
she
perceived
him
in
this
place
it
was
in
the
following
winter
that
she
was
reminded
of
him
by
other
means
than
those
of
his
letters
the
summer
and
autumn
had
passed
tranquilly
enough
so
far
as
this
outlying
corner
of
england
was
concerned
news
filtered
through
of
the
stirring
world
outside
and
especially
was
there
conveyed
to
her
through
alice
for
the
most
part
news
that
concerned
the
fortunes
of
catholics
politics
except
in
this
connection
meant
little
enough
to
such
as
her
she
heard
indeed
from
time
to
time
vague
rumours
of
fighting
and
of
foreign
powers
and
thought
now
and
again
of
spain
as
of
a
country
that
might
yet
be
in
god
hand
an
instrument
for
the
restoring
of
god
cause
in
england
she
had
heard
too
in
this
year
of
one
more
rumour
of
the
queen
marriage
with
the
duke
and
then
of
its
final
rupture
but
these
matters
were
aloof
from
her
rather
she
pondered
such
things
as
the
execution
of
two
more
priests
at
york
in
august
lacy
and
kirkman
and
of
a
third
thompson
in
november
at
the
same
place
it
was
on
such
affairs
as
these
that
she
pondered
as
she
went
about
her
household
business
or
sat
in
the
chamber
upstairs
with
mistress
alice
and
it
was
of
these
things
that
she
talked
with
the
few
priests
that
came
and
went
from
time
to
time
in
their
circuits
about
derbyshire
it
was
a
life
of
quietness
and
monotony
inconceivable
by
those
who
live
in
towns
its
sole
incident
lay
in
that
life
which
is
called
interior
it
was
soon
after
the
new
year
that
she
met
the
squire
of
matstead
face
to
face
she
and
alice
with
janet
and
a
man
riding
behind
were
on
their
way
back
from
derby
where
they
had
gone
for
their
monthly
shopping
they
had
slept
at
dethick
and
had
had
news
there
of
anthony
who
was
again
in
the
south
on
one
of
his
mysterious
missions
and
started
again
soon
after
dawn
next
day
to
reach
home
if
they
could
for
dinner
she
knew
alice
now
for
what
she
was
a
woman
of
astounding
dullness
of
sterling
character
and
of
a
complete
inability
to
understand
any
shades
or
tones
of
character
or
thought
that
were
not
her
own
and
yet
a
friend
in
a
thousand
of
an
immovable
stability
and
loyalty
one
of
no
words
at
all
who
dwelt
in
the
midst
of
a
steady
kind
of
light
which
knew
no
dawn
nor
sunset
the
girl
entertained
herself
sometimes
with
conceiving
of
her
friend
confronted
with
the
rack
let
us
say
or
the
gallows
and
perceived
that
she
knew
with
exactness
what
her
behaviour
would
be
she
would
do
all
that
was
required
of
her
with
out
speeches
or
protest
she
would
place
herself
in
the
required
positions
with
a
faint
smile
unwavering
she
would
suffer
or
die
with
the
same
tranquil
steadiness
as
that
in
which
she
lived
and
best
of
all
she
would
not
be
aware
even
for
an
instant
that
anything
in
her
behaviour
was
in
the
least
admirable
or
exceptional
she
resembled
to
marjorie
mind
that
for
which
a
strong
and
stands
in
relation
to
the
body
it
is
the
same
always
supporting
and
sustaining
always
and
can
not
even
be
imagined
as
anything
else
it
was
a
brilliant
frosty
day
as
they
rode
over
the
rutted
track
between
hedges
that
served
for
a
road
that
ran
for
the
most
part
a
field
or
two
away
from
the
black
waters
of
the
derwent
the
birches
stood
about
them
like
frozen
feathers
the
vast
chestnuts
towered
overhead
motionless
in
the
motionless
air
as
they
came
towards
matstead
and
at
last
rode
up
the
street
naturally
enough
marjorie
again
began
to
think
of
robin
as
they
came
near
where
the
track
turned
the
corner
beneath
the
churchyard
wall
where
once
robin
had
watched
himself
unseen
the
three
riders
go
by
she
had
to
attend
to
her
horse
who
slipped
once
or
twice
on
the
paved
causeway
then
as
she
lifted
her
head
again
she
saw
not
three
yards
from
her
and
on
a
level
with
her
own
face
the
face
of
the
squire
looking
at
her
from
over
the
wall
she
had
not
seen
him
except
once
in
derby
a
year
or
two
before
and
that
at
a
distance
since
robin
had
left
england
and
at
the
sight
she
started
so
violently
in
some
manner
jerking
the
reins
that
she
held
that
her
horse
tired
with
the
long
ride
of
the
day
before
slipped
once
again
and
came
down
all
asprawl
on
the
stones
fortunately
throwing
her
clear
of
his
struggling
feet
she
was
up
in
a
moment
but
again
sank
down
aware
that
her
foot
was
in
some
way
bruised
or
twisted
there
was
a
clatter
of
hoofs
behind
her
as
the
servants
rode
up
a
child
or
two
ran
up
the
street
and
when
at
last
on
janet
arm
she
rose
again
to
her
feet
it
was
to
see
the
squire
staring
at
her
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
bring
the
ladies
up
to
the
house
he
said
abruptly
to
the
man
and
then
taking
the
rein
of
the
girl
horse
that
had
struggled
up
again
he
led
the
way
without
another
word
without
even
turning
his
head
round
to
the
way
that
ran
up
to
his
gates
ii
it
was
not
with
any
want
of
emotion
that
marjorie
found
herself
presently
meekly
seated
upon
alice
horse
and
riding
up
at
a
beneath
the
gatehouse
of
the
hall
rather
it
was
the
balance
of
emotions
that
made
her
so
meek
and
so
obedient
to
her
tranquil
assumption
that
she
must
come
in
as
the
squire
said
she
was
aware
of
a
strong
resentment
to
his
brusque
order
as
well
as
to
the
thought
that
it
was
to
the
house
of
an
apostate
that
she
was
going
yet
there
was
a
no
less
strong
emotion
within
her
that
he
had
a
sort
of
right
to
command
her
these
feelings
working
upon
her
dazed
as
she
was
by
the
sudden
sharpness
of
her
fall
and
the
pain
in
her
foot
combined
to
drive
her
along
in
a
kind
of
resignation
in
the
wake
of
the
squire
still
confused
yet
with
a
rapid
series
of
these
same
emotions
running
before
her
mind
she
limped
up
the
steps
supported
by
alice
and
her
maid
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
squire
who
had
shouted
an
order
or
two
to
a
peeping
domestic
as
he
passed
up
the
court
came
to
her
immediately
with
a
cup
in
his
hand
you
must
drink
this
at
once
mistress
she
took
it
at
once
drank
and
set
it
down
aware
of
the
keen
face
that
watched
her
you
will
dine
here
too
mistress
he
began
still
with
a
sharp
kindness
and
then
on
a
sudden
all
grew
dark
about
her
there
was
a
roaring
in
her
ears
and
she
fainted
she
came
out
of
her
swoon
again
after
a
while
with
that
strange
and
innocent
clearness
that
usually
follows
such
a
thing
to
find
alice
beside
her
a
tapestried
wall
behind
alice
and
the
sound
of
a
crackling
fire
in
her
ears
then
she
perceived
that
she
was
in
a
small
room
lying
on
her
back
along
a
bench
and
that
someone
was
bathing
her
foot
i
i
will
not
stay
here
she
began
but
two
hands
held
her
firmly
down
and
alice
reassuring
face
was
looking
into
her
own
when
her
mind
ran
clearly
again
she
sat
up
with
a
sudden
movement
drawing
her
foot
away
from
janet
ministrations
i
do
very
well
she
said
after
looking
at
her
foot
and
then
putting
it
to
the
ground
amid
a
duet
of
protestations
she
had
looked
round
the
room
to
satisfy
herself
that
no
one
else
was
there
and
had
seen
that
it
must
be
the
parlour
that
she
was
in
a
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
and
the
two
doors
were
closed
then
alice
explained
it
was
impossible
she
said
to
ride
on
at
once
the
horse
even
now
was
being
bathed
in
the
stable
as
his
mistress
in
the
parlour
the
squire
had
been
most
considerate
he
had
helped
to
carry
her
in
here
just
now
had
lighted
the
fire
with
his
own
hands
and
had
stated
that
dinner
would
be
sent
in
here
in
an
hour
for
the
three
women
he
had
offered
to
send
one
of
his
own
men
on
to
booth
edge
with
the
news
if
mistress
marjorie
found
herself
unable
to
ride
on
after
dinner
but
but
it
is
mr
audrey
exclaimed
marjorie
yes
my
dear
said
alice
i
know
it
is
but
that
does
not
mend
your
foot
she
said
with
unusual
curtness
and
marjorie
saw
that
she
still
looked
at
her
anxiously
the
three
women
dined
together
of
course
in
an
hour
time
there
was
no
escape
from
the
pressure
of
circumstance
it
was
unfortunate
that
such
an
accident
should
have
fallen
out
here
in
the
one
place
in
all
the
world
where
it
should
not
but
the
fact
was
a
fact
meanwhile
it
was
not
only
resentment
that
marjorie
felt
it
was
a
strange
sort
of
terror
as
well
a
terror
of
sitting
in
the
house
of
an
apostate
of
one
who
had
freely
and
deliberately
renounced
that
faith
for
which
she
herself
lived
so
completely
and
that
it
was
the
father
of
one
whom
she
knew
as
she
knew
robin
with
whose
fate
indeed
her
own
had
been
so
intimately
entwined
this
combined
to
increase
that
indefinable
fear
that
rested
on
her
as
she
stared
round
the
walls
and
sat
over
the
food
and
drink
that
this
man
provided
the
climax
came
as
they
were
finishing
dinner
for
the
door
from
the
hall
opened
abruptly
and
the
squire
came
in
he
bowed
to
the
ladies
as
the
manner
was
straightening
his
trim
tight
figure
again
defiantly
asked
a
civil
question
or
two
directed
a
servant
behind
him
to
bring
the
horses
to
the
parlour
door
in
half
an
hour
time
and
then
snapped
out
the
sentence
which
he
was
plainly
impatient
to
speak
mistress
manners
he
said
i
wish
to
have
a
word
with
you
privately
marjorie
trembling
at
his
presence
turned
a
wavering
face
to
her
friend
and
alice
before
the
other
could
speak
rose
up
and
went
out
with
janet
following
janet
cried
the
girl
if
you
please
said
the
old
man
with
such
a
decisive
air
that
she
hesitated
then
she
nodded
at
her
maid
and
a
moment
later
the
door
closed
iii
i
have
two
matters
to
speak
of
said
the
squire
abruptly
sitting
down
in
the
chair
that
alice
had
left
the
first
concerns
you
closely
and
the
other
less
closely
she
looked
at
him
summoning
all
her
power
to
appear
at
her
ease
he
seemed
far
older
than
when
she
had
last
spoken
with
him
perhaps
five
years
ago
and
had
grown
a
little
pointed
beard
his
hair
too
seemed
thinner
such
of
it
as
she
could
see
beneath
the
that
he
wore
his
face
especially
about
his
blue
eyes
was
covered
with
fine
wrinkles
and
his
hands
were
clearly
the
hands
of
an
old
man
at
once
delicate
and
sinewy
he
was
in
a
dark
suit
still
with
his
cloak
upon
him
and
in
low
boots
he
sat
still
as
upright
as
ever
turned
a
little
in
his
chair
so
as
to
clasp
its
back
with
one
strong
hand
yes
sir
she
said
i
will
begin
with
the
second
first
it
is
of
my
son
robin
i
wish
to
know
what
news
you
have
of
him
he
hath
not
written
to
me
this
six
months
back
and
i
hear
that
letters
sometimes
come
to
you
from
him
marjorie
hesitated
he
is
very
well
so
far
as
i
know
she
said
and
when
is
he
to
be
made
priest
he
demanded
sharply
marjorie
drew
a
breath
to
give
herself
time
she
knew
that
she
must
not
answer
this
and
did
not
know
how
to
say
so
with
civility
if
he
has
not
told
you
himself
sir
she
said
i
can
not
the
old
man
face
twitched
but
he
kept
his
manners
i
understand
you
mistress
but
then
his
wrath
overcame
him
but
he
must
understand
he
will
have
no
mercy
from
me
if
he
comes
my
way
i
am
a
magistrate
now
mistress
and
a
thought
like
an
inspiration
came
to
the
girl
and
she
interrupted
for
she
longed
to
penetrate
this
man
armour
perhaps
that
was
why
he
did
not
tell
you
when
he
was
to
be
made
priest
she
said
the
other
seemed
taken
aback
why
but
he
did
not
wish
to
think
that
his
father
would
be
untrue
to
his
new
commission
she
said
trembling
at
her
boldness
and
yet
exultant
too
and
taking
no
pains
to
keep
the
irony
out
of
her
voice
again
that
fierce
twitch
of
the
features
went
over
the
other
face
and
he
stared
straight
at
her
with
narrowed
eyes
then
a
change
again
came
over
him
and
he
laughed
like
barking
yet
not
all
unkindly
you
are
very
shrewd
mistress
but
i
wonder
what
you
will
think
of
me
when
i
tell
you
the
second
matter
since
you
will
tell
me
no
more
of
the
first
he
shifted
his
position
in
his
chair
this
time
clasping
both
his
hands
together
over
the
back
well
it
is
this
in
a
word
he
said
it
is
that
you
had
best
look
to
yourself
mistress
my
lord
shrewsbury
even
knows
of
it
of
what
if
you
please
asked
the
girl
hoping
she
had
not
turned
white
why
of
the
priests
that
come
and
go
hereabouts
it
is
all
known
and
her
grace
hath
sent
a
message
from
the
council
what
has
this
to
do
with
me
he
laughed
again
well
let
us
take
your
neighbours
at
padley
they
will
be
in
trouble
if
they
do
not
look
to
their
goings
fitzherbert
but
again
she
interrupted
him
she
was
determined
to
know
how
much
he
knew
she
had
thought
that
she
had
been
discreet
enough
and
that
no
news
had
leaked
out
of
her
own
entertaining
of
priests
it
was
chiefly
that
discretion
might
be
preserved
that
she
had
set
her
hands
to
the
work
at
all
with
padley
so
near
it
was
thought
that
less
suspicion
would
be
aroused
her
name
had
never
yet
come
before
the
authorities
so
far
as
she
knew
but
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
me
sir
she
asked
sharply
it
is
true
that
i
do
not
go
to
church
and
that
i
pay
my
fines
when
they
are
demanded
are
there
new
laws
then
against
the
old
faith
she
spoke
with
something
of
real
bitterness
it
was
genuine
enough
her
only
art
lay
in
her
not
concealing
it
for
she
was
determined
to
press
her
question
home
and
in
his
shrewd
compelling
face
she
read
her
answer
even
before
his
words
gave
it
well
mistress
it
was
not
of
you
that
i
meant
to
speak
so
much
as
of
your
friends
they
are
your
friends
not
mine
and
as
your
friends
i
thought
it
to
be
a
kindly
action
to
send
them
an
advertisement
if
they
are
not
careful
there
will
be
trouble
at
padley
at
padley
or
elsewhere
it
is
the
persons
that
fall
under
the
law
not
places
but
sir
you
are
a
magistrate
and
he
sprang
up
his
face
aflame
with
real
wrath
yes
mistress
i
am
a
magistrate
the
commission
hath
come
at
last
after
six
months
waiting
but
i
was
friend
to
the
fitzherberts
before
ever
i
was
a
magistrate
and
then
she
understood
and
her
heart
went
out
to
him
she
too
stood
up
catching
at
the
table
with
a
hiss
of
pain
as
she
threw
her
weight
on
the
bruised
foot
he
made
a
movement
towards
her
but
she
waved
him
aside
i
beg
your
pardon
audrey
with
all
my
heart
i
had
thought
that
you
meant
harm
perhaps
to
my
friends
and
me
but
now
i
see
not
a
word
more
not
a
word
more
he
cried
harshly
with
a
desperate
kind
of
gesture
i
shall
do
my
duty
none
the
less
when
the
time
comes
sir
she
cried
out
suddenly
for
god
sake
do
not
speak
of
duty
there
is
another
duty
greater
than
that
audrey
he
wheeled
away
from
her
with
a
movement
she
could
not
interpret
it
might
be
uncontrolled
anger
or
misery
equally
and
her
heart
went
out
to
him
in
one
great
flood
audrey
it
is
not
too
late
your
son
robin
then
he
wheeled
again
and
his
face
was
distorted
with
emotion
yes
my
son
robin
my
son
robin
how
dare
you
speak
of
him
to
me
yes
that
is
it
my
son
robin
my
son
robin
he
dropped
into
the
chair
again
and
his
face
fell
upon
his
clasped
hands
iv
she
scarcely
knew
how
circumstances
had
arranged
themselves
up
to
the
time
when
she
found
herself
riding
away
again
with
alice
while
a
man
of
audrey
led
her
horse
they
could
not
talk
freely
till
he
left
them
at
the
place
where
the
stony
road
turned
to
a
soft
track
and
it
was
safe
going
once
more
then
alice
told
her
own
side
of
it
yes
my
dear
i
heard
him
call
out
i
was
walking
in
the
hall
with
janet
to
keep
ourselves
warm
but
when
i
ran
in
he
was
sitting
down
and
you
were
standing
what
was
the
matter
alice
said
the
girl
earnestly
i
wish
you
had
not
come
in
he
is
very
i
think
he
would
have
told
me
more
i
think
it
is
about
his
son
his
son
why
he
yes
i
know
that
and
he
would
not
see
him
if
he
came
back
he
has
had
his
magistrate
commission
and
he
will
be
true
to
it
but
he
is
for
all
that
he
has
not
really
lost
the
faith
i
think
why
my
dear
that
is
foolish
he
is
very
hot
in
derby
i
hear
against
the
papists
there
was
a
poor
woman
who
could
not
pay
her
fines
and
marjorie
waved
it
aside
yes
he
would
be
very
hot
but
for
all
that
there
is
his
son
robin
you
know
and
his
memories
and
robin
has
not
written
to
him
for
six
months
that
would
be
about
the
time
when
he
told
him
he
was
to
be
a
magistrate
then
marjorie
told
her
of
the
whole
that
had
passed
and
of
his
mention
of
the
fitzherberts
and
what
he
meant
by
that
she
said
i
do
not
know
but
i
will
tell
them
she
was
pondering
deeply
all
the
way
as
she
rode
home
mistress
alice
was
one
of
those
folks
who
so
long
as
they
are
answered
in
words
are
content
and
marjorie
so
answered
her
and
all
the
while
she
thought
upon
robin
and
his
passionate
old
father
and
attempted
to
understand
the
emotions
that
fought
in
the
heart
that
had
so
disclosed
itself
to
her
its
aged
obstinacy
its
loyalty
and
its
confused
honourableness
she
knew
very
well
that
he
would
do
what
he
conceived
to
be
his
duty
with
all
the
more
zeal
if
it
were
an
unpleasant
duty
and
she
thanked
god
that
it
was
not
for
a
good
while
yet
that
the
lad
would
come
home
a
priest
chapter
viii
i
the
warning
which
she
had
had
with
regard
to
her
friends
and
which
she
wrote
on
to
them
at
once
received
its
fulfilment
within
a
very
few
weeks
john
who
was
on
the
eve
of
departure
for
london
again
to
serve
his
brother
there
who
was
back
again
in
the
fleet
by
now
wrote
that
he
knew
very
well
that
they
were
all
under
suspicion
that
he
had
sent
on
to
his
son
the
message
she
had
given
but
that
he
hoped
they
would
yet
weather
the
storm
and
as
to
yourself
mistress
marjorie
he
wrote
this
makes
it
all
the
more
necessary
that
booth
edge
should
not
be
suspected
for
what
will
our
men
do
if
padley
be
closed
to
them
you
have
heard
of
our
friend
garlick
capture
but
that
was
no
fault
of
yours
the
man
was
warned
i
hear
that
they
will
send
him
into
banishment
only
this
time
the
news
came
to
her
as
she
sat
in
the
garden
over
her
needlework
on
a
hot
evening
in
june
there
it
was
as
cool
as
anywhere
in
the
countryside
she
sat
at
the
top
of
the
garden
where
her
mother
and
she
had
sat
with
robin
so
long
before
the
breeze
that
came
over
the
moor
bore
with
it
the
scent
of
the
heather
and
the
bees
were
busy
in
the
garden
flowers
about
her
it
was
first
the
gallop
of
a
horse
that
she
heard
and
even
at
that
sound
she
laid
down
her
work
and
stood
up
but
the
house
below
her
blocked
the
most
of
her
view
and
she
sat
down
again
when
she
heard
the
dull
rattle
of
the
hoofs
die
away
again
when
she
next
looked
up
a
man
was
running
towards
her
from
the
bottom
of
the
garden
and
janet
was
peeping
behind
him
from
the
gate
into
the
court
as
she
again
stood
up
she
saw
that
it
was
dick
sampson
he
was
so
out
of
breath
first
with
his
ride
and
next
with
his
run
up
the
steep
path
that
for
a
moment
or
two
he
could
not
speak
he
was
dusty
too
from
foot
to
knee
his
cap
was
awry
and
his
collar
unbuttoned
it
is
thomas
mistress
he
gasped
presently
i
was
in
derby
and
saw
him
being
taken
to
the
gaol
i
could
not
get
speech
with
him
i
rode
straight
up
to
padley
and
found
none
there
but
the
servants
and
them
knowing
nothing
of
the
matter
and
so
i
rode
on
here
mistress
he
was
plainly
all
aghast
at
the
blow
hitherto
it
had
been
enough
that
sir
thomas
was
in
ward
for
his
religion
and
to
this
they
had
become
accustomed
but
that
the
heir
should
be
taken
too
and
that
without
a
hint
of
what
was
to
happen
was
wholly
unexpected
she
made
him
sit
down
and
presently
drew
from
him
the
whole
tale
anthony
babington
his
master
was
away
to
london
again
leaving
the
house
in
derby
in
the
hands
of
the
servants
he
then
dick
sampson
was
riding
out
early
to
take
a
horse
to
be
shoed
and
had
come
back
through
the
when
he
saw
the
group
ride
up
to
the
gaol
door
near
the
friar
gate
he
too
had
ridden
up
to
ask
what
was
forward
and
had
been
just
in
time
to
see
thomas
taken
in
he
had
caught
his
eye
but
had
feigned
not
to
know
him
then
the
man
had
attempted
to
get
at
what
had
happened
from
one
of
the
fellows
at
the
door
but
could
get
no
more
from
him
than
that
the
prisoner
was
a
known
and
confessed
recusant
and
had
been
laid
by
the
heels
according
to
orders
it
was
believed
sent
down
by
the
council
then
dick
had
ridden
slowly
away
till
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
then
hot
foot
for
padley
and
i
heard
the
fellow
say
to
one
of
his
company
that
an
informer
was
coming
down
from
london
on
purpose
to
deal
with
mr
thomas
marjorie
felt
a
sudden
pang
for
she
had
never
forgotten
the
one
she
had
set
eyes
on
in
the
tower
his
name
she
said
breathlessly
did
you
hear
his
name
it
was
topcliffe
mistress
said
dick
indifferently
the
other
called
it
out
marjorie
sat
silent
not
only
had
the
blow
fallen
more
swiftly
than
she
would
have
thought
possible
but
it
was
coupled
with
a
second
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
that
it
was
this
man
above
all
others
that
should
have
come
this
man
who
stood
to
her
mind
by
a
mere
chance
for
all
that
was
most
dreadful
in
the
sinister
forces
arrayed
against
her
this
brought
misery
down
on
her
indeed
for
besides
her
own
personal
reasons
for
terror
there
was
besides
the
knowledge
that
the
bringing
of
such
a
man
at
all
from
london
on
such
business
meant
that
the
movement
beginning
here
in
her
own
county
was
not
a
mere
caprice
she
sat
silent
then
seeing
once
more
before
her
the
wide
court
of
the
tower
the
great
keep
opposite
and
in
the
midst
that
thin
figure
moving
to
his
hateful
business
and
she
knew
now
in
this
instant
as
never
before
that
the
chief
reason
for
her
terror
was
that
she
had
coupled
in
her
mind
her
own
friend
robin
with
the
thought
of
this
man
as
if
by
some
inner
knowledge
that
their
lives
must
cross
some
day
a
knowledge
which
she
could
neither
justify
nor
silence
thank
god
at
least
that
robin
was
still
safe
in
rheims
ii
she
sent
him
off
after
a
couple
of
hours
rest
during
which
once
more
he
had
told
his
story
to
mistress
alice
with
a
letter
to
wife
who
no
doubt
would
have
followed
her
lord
to
derby
she
had
gone
apart
with
alice
while
dick
ate
and
drank
to
talk
the
affair
out
and
had
told
her
of
topcliffe
presence
at
which
news
even
the
placid
face
of
her
friend
looked
troubled
but
they
had
said
nothing
more
on
the
point
and
had
decided
that
a
letter
should
be
written
in
mistress
babington
name
offering
fitzherbert
the
hospitality
of
babington
house
and
any
other
services
she
might
wish
further
they
had
decided
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
go
themselves
to
derby
next
day
in
order
to
be
at
hand
since
john
was
in
london
and
the
sooner
thomas
had
friends
with
her
the
better
they
may
keep
him
in
ward
a
long
time
said
mistress
alice
before
they
bring
him
into
open
court
to
try
his
courage
that
is
the
way
they
do
the
charge
no
doubt
will
be
that
he
has
harboured
and
assisted
priests
it
seemed
to
marjorie
as
she
lay
awake
that
night
staring
through
the
summer
dusk
at
the
tall
press
which
hid
so
much
beside
her
dresses
that
the
course
on
which
her
life
moved
was
coming
near
to
the
rapids
ever
since
she
had
first
put
her
hand
to
the
work
ever
since
even
she
had
first
offered
her
lover
to
god
and
let
him
go
from
her
it
appeared
as
if
god
had
taken
her
at
her
word
and
accepted
in
an
instant
that
which
she
offered
so
tremblingly
her
sight
of
london
the
great
buildings
the
crowds
the
visible
forces
of
the
crown
the
company
of
gallant
gentlemen
who
were
priests
beneath
their
ruffs
and
feathers
the
tower
her
glimpse
of
topcliffe
these
things
had
shown
her
the
dreadful
reality
that
lay
behind
this
gentle
scheming
up
in
derbyshire
again
there
was
babington
here
too
she
had
perceived
a
mystery
which
she
could
not
understand
something
moved
behind
the
surface
of
which
not
even
babington
sister
knew
anything
except
that
indeed
it
was
there
again
there
was
the
death
of
father
campion
the
very
man
whom
she
had
taken
as
a
symbol
of
the
faith
for
which
she
fought
with
her
woman
wits
there
was
the
news
that
came
so
suddenly
and
terribly
now
and
again
of
one
more
priest
gone
to
his
death
it
was
like
the
slow
rising
of
a
storm
the
air
darkens
a
stillness
falls
on
the
countryside
the
chirp
of
the
birds
seems
as
a
plaintive
word
of
fear
then
the
thunder
begins
a
low
murmur
far
across
the
horizons
then
a
whisk
of
light
seen
and
gone
again
and
another
murmur
after
it
and
so
it
gathers
dusk
on
dusk
stillness
on
stillness
murmur
on
murmur
deepening
and
thickening
yet
still
no
rain
but
a
drop
or
two
that
falls
and
ceases
again
and
from
the
very
delay
it
is
all
the
more
dreadful
for
the
storm
itself
must
break
some
time
and
the
artillery
war
in
the
heavens
and
the
rain
rush
down
and
flash
follow
flash
and
peal
peal
and
the
climax
come
so
then
it
was
with
her
there
was
no
drawing
back
now
even
had
she
wished
it
and
she
wished
it
indeed
though
she
did
not
will
it
she
knew
that
she
must
stand
in
her
place
now
more
than
ever
when
the
blow
had
fallen
so
near
now
more
than
ever
must
she
be
discreet
and
resolute
since
padley
itself
was
fallen
in
effect
if
not
in
fact
and
booth
edge
in
this
valley
at
least
was
the
one
hope
of
hunted
men
she
must
stand
then
in
her
place
she
must
plot
and
conspire
and
scheme
she
must
govern
her
face
and
her
manner
more
perfectly
than
ever
for
the
sake
of
that
tremendous
cause
as
she
lay
there
listening
to
her
friend
breathing
in
the
darkness
staring
now
at
the
doors
of
the
press
now
at
the
baggage
that
lay
heaped
ready
for
the
early
start
these
and
a
thousand
other
thoughts
passed
before
her
it
was
a
long
plot
that
had
ended
in
this
it
must
have
reached
its
maturity
weeks
ago
the
decision
to
strike
must
have
been
reached
before
even
squire
audrey
had
given
her
the
warning
for
it
was
only
by
chance
that
she
had
met
him
and
he
had
told
her
and
he
too
robin
father
would
be
in
the
midst
of
it
all
he
too
that
was
a
catholic
by
baptism
must
sit
with
the
other
magistrates
and
threaten
and
cajole
as
the
manner
was
and
quiet
derby
would
be
all
astir
and
the
bassetts
would
be
there
and
fenton
to
see
how
their
friend
fared
in
the
dock
and
the
crowds
would
gather
to
see
the
prisoner
brought
out
and
the
hunt
would
be
up
and
she
herself
she
too
must
be
there
with
the
tearful
little
wife
who
could
do
so
little
thank
god
robin
was
safe
in
rheims
iii
derby
was
indeed
astir
as
they
rode
in
with
the
servants
and
the
baggage
following
behind
on
the
late
afternoon
of
the
next
day
they
had
ridden
by
easy
stages
halting
at
dethick
for
dinner
where
the
babingtons
house
already
hummed
with
dismay
at
the
news
that
had
come
from
derby
last
night
anthony
was
away
and
all
seemed
distracted
they
rode
in
by
the
north
road
seeing
for
the
last
mile
or
two
of
their
ride
the
towering
spire
of
all
saints
church
high
above
the
smoke
of
the
houses
they
passed
the
old
bridge
half
a
mile
from
the
near
the
ancient
camp
and
even
here
overheard
a
sentence
or
two
from
a
couple
of
fellows
that
were
leaning
on
the
parapet
that
told
them
what
was
the
talk
of
the
town
it
was
plain
that
others
besides
the
catholics
understood
the
taking
of
thomas
fitzherbert
to
be
a
very
significant
matter
babington
house
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
from
that
on
which
they
entered
and
alice
was
for
going
there
through
side
streets
they
will
take
notice
if
we
go
straight
through
she
said
it
is
they
will
take
notice
in
any
case
said
marjorie
it
will
be
over
the
town
that
mistress
babington
is
here
and
it
is
best
therefore
to
come
openly
as
if
without
fear
and
she
turned
to
beckon
the
servants
to
draw
up
closer
behind
the
square
was
indeed
crowded
as
they
came
in
from
all
the
country
round
and
especially
from
dovedale
the
farmers
came
in
on
this
day
or
sent
their
wives
for
the
selling
of
cheeses
and
the
small
oblong
of
the
market
the
smaller
from
its
great
conduit
and
cross
was
full
with
rows
of
stalls
and
carts
with
four
lanes
only
left
along
the
edges
by
which
the
traffic
might
pass
and
even
here
the
streams
of
passengers
forced
the
horses
to
go
in
single
file
groups
of
men
farmers
servants
who
had
driven
in
the
carts
or
walked
with
the
to
whom
this
day
was
a
kind
of
feast
stood
along
the
edges
of
the
booths
eyeing
all
who
went
by
the
inns
too
were
doing
a
roaring
trade
and
it
was
from
one
of
these
that
the
only
offensive
comment
was
made
mistress
babington
rode
first
as
suited
her
dignity
preceded
by
one
of
the
dethick
men
whom
they
had
taken
up
on
their
way
and
who
had
pushed
forward
when
they
came
into
the
town
to
clear
the
road
and
mistress
manners
rode
after
her
the
men
stood
aside
as
the
cavalcade
began
to
go
between
the
booths
and
the
most
of
them
saluted
mistress
babington
but
as
they
were
almost
out
of
the
market
they
came
abreast
one
of
the
inns
from
whose
doors
came
a
roar
of
voices
from
those
that
were
drinking
within
and
a
group
that
was
gathered
on
the
step
stopped
talking
as
the
party
came
up
marjorie
glanced
at
them
and
noticed
there
was
an
air
about
two
or
three
of
the
men
that
was
plainly
there
was
a
certain
difference
in
the
cut
of
their
clothes
and
the
way
they
wore
them
then
she
saw
two
or
three
whispering
together
and
the
next
moment
came
a
brutal
shout
she
could
not
catch
the
sentence
but
she
heard
the
word
papist
with
an
adjective
and
caught
the
unmistakable
bullying
tone
of
the
man
the
next
instant
there
broke
out
a
confusion
a
man
dashed
up
the
step
from
the
crowd
beneath
and
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
dick
sampson
furious
face
then
the
group
bore
back
fighting
into
the
inn
door
the
dethick
servant
leapt
off
his
horse
leaving
it
in
some
fellow
hands
and
vanished
up
the
step
there
was
a
rush
of
the
crowd
after
him
and
then
the
way
was
clear
in
front
over
the
little
bridge
that
spanned
bramble
brook
when
she
drew
level
with
alice
she
saw
her
friend
face
pale
and
agitated
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
been
cried
at
she
said
come
we
are
nearly
home
there
is
peter
spire
shall
we
not
began
marjorie
no
no
and
the
pale
face
tightened
suddenly
my
fellows
will
give
them
a
lesson
the
crowd
is
on
our
side
as
yet
iv
as
they
rode
in
under
the
archway
that
led
in
beside
the
great
doors
of
babington
house
three
or
four
grooms
ran
forward
at
once
it
was
plain
that
their
coming
was
looked
for
with
some
eagerness
alice
manner
seemed
curiously
different
from
that
of
the
quiet
woman
who
had
sat
so
patiently
beside
marjorie
in
the
manor
among
the
hills
a
certain
air
of
authority
and
dignity
sat
on
her
now
that
she
was
back
in
her
own
place
is
fitzherbert
here
she
asked
from
the
groom
who
helped
her
to
the
ground
yes
mistress
she
came
from
the
inn
this
morning
and
well
she
is
in
a
great
taking
mistress
she
would
eat
nothing
they
said
alice
nodded
you
had
best
be
off
to
the
inn
she
said
with
a
jerk
of
her
head
a
london
fellow
insulted
us
just
now
and
sampson
and
mallow
she
said
no
more
the
man
who
held
her
horse
slipped
the
reins
into
the
hands
of
the
younger
groom
who
stood
by
him
and
was
away
and
out
of
the
court
in
an
instant
marjorie
smiled
a
little
astonished
at
her
own
sense
of
exultation
the
blows
were
not
to
be
all
one
side
she
perceived
then
she
followed
alice
into
the
house
as
they
came
through
into
the
hall
by
the
that
led
through
from
the
court
where
they
had
dismounted
a
figure
was
plainly
visible
in
the
dusky
light
going
to
and
fro
at
the
further
end
with
a
quick
nervous
movement
the
figure
stopped
as
they
advanced
and
then
darted
forward
crying
out
piteously
ah
you
have
come
thank
god
thank
god
they
will
not
let
me
see
him
hush
hush
said
alice
as
she
caught
her
in
her
arms
bassett
has
been
here
moaned
the
figure
and
he
says
it
is
topcliffe
himself
who
has
come
down
on
the
matter
he
says
he
is
the
greatest
devil
of
them
all
and
thomas
then
she
burst
out
crying
again
it
was
an
hour
before
they
could
get
the
full
tale
out
of
her
they
took
her
upstairs
and
made
her
sit
down
for
already
a
couple
of
faces
peeped
from
the
buttery
and
the
servants
would
have
gathered
in
another
five
minutes
and
together
they
forced
her
to
eat
and
drink
something
for
she
had
not
tasted
food
since
her
arrival
at
the
inn
yesterday
and
so
little
by
little
they
drew
the
story
out
thomas
and
his
wife
were
actually
on
their
way
from
norbury
when
the
arrest
had
been
made
thomas
had
intended
to
pass
a
couple
of
nights
in
derby
on
various
matters
of
the
estates
and
although
his
wife
said
he
had
been
somewhat
silent
and
quiet
since
the
warning
had
come
to
him
from
audrey
even
he
had
thought
it
no
danger
to
ride
through
derby
on
his
way
to
padley
he
had
sent
a
servant
ahead
to
order
rooms
at
the
inn
for
those
two
nights
and
it
was
through
that
it
appeared
that
the
news
of
his
coming
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
authorities
however
that
was
and
whether
the
stroke
had
been
actually
determined
upon
long
before
or
had
been
suddenly
decided
upon
at
the
news
of
his
coming
it
fell
out
that
as
the
husband
and
wife
were
actually
within
sight
of
derby
on
turning
a
corner
they
had
found
themselves
surrounded
by
men
on
horses
plainly
gathered
there
for
the
purpose
with
a
magistrate
in
the
midst
their
names
had
been
demanded
and
upon
hesitation
they
had
been
told
that
their
names
were
well
known
and
a
warrant
was
produced
on
a
charge
of
recusancy
and
of
aiding
her
enemies
drawn
out
against
thomas
fitzherbert
and
he
had
been
placed
under
arrest
further
fitzherbert
had
been
told
she
must
not
enter
the
town
with
the
party
but
must
go
either
before
them
or
after
them
which
she
pleased
she
had
chosen
to
go
first
and
had
been
at
the
windows
of
the
inn
in
time
to
see
her
husband
go
by
there
had
been
no
confusion
she
said
the
townsfolk
appeared
to
know
nothing
of
what
was
happening
until
thomas
was
safely
lodged
in
the
ward
then
she
burst
out
crying
again
lamenting
the
horrible
state
of
the
prison
as
it
had
been
described
to
her
and
demanding
to
know
where
god
justice
was
in
allowing
his
faithful
servants
to
be
so
tormented
and
harried
marjorie
watched
her
closely
she
had
met
her
once
at
babington
house
when
she
was
still
elizabeth
westley
but
had
thought
little
or
nothing
of
her
since
she
was
a
pale
little
creature
and
timorous
and
had
now
a
hunted
look
of
misery
in
her
eyes
that
was
very
piteous
to
see
it
was
plain
they
had
done
right
in
coming
this
woman
would
be
of
little
service
to
her
husband
then
when
alice
had
said
a
word
or
two
marjorie
began
her
questions
tell
me
she
said
gently
had
you
no
warning
of
this
the
girl
shook
her
head
not
beyond
that
which
came
from
yourself
she
said
and
we
never
thought
hath
thomas
had
any
priests
with
him
lately
we
have
not
had
one
at
norbury
for
the
last
six
months
whilst
we
were
there
at
least
my
husband
said
it
was
better
not
and
that
there
was
a
plenty
of
places
for
them
to
go
to
and
you
have
not
heard
mass
during
that
time
the
girl
looked
at
her
with
eyes
no
she
said
but
why
do
you
ask
that
my
husband
says
and
when
was
the
first
you
heard
of
topcliffe
and
what
have
you
heard
of
him
the
other
face
fell
into
lines
of
misery
i
have
heard
he
is
the
greatest
devil
her
grace
uses
he
hath
authority
to
question
priests
and
others
in
his
own
house
he
hath
a
rack
there
that
he
boasts
makes
all
others
as
christmas
toys
my
husband
marjorie
patted
her
arm
gently
there
there
she
said
kindly
your
husband
is
not
in
house
there
will
be
no
question
of
that
he
is
here
in
his
own
county
and
but
that
will
not
save
him
cried
the
girl
why
tell
me
interrupted
marjorie
was
topcliffe
with
the
men
that
took
mr
thomas
the
other
shook
her
head
no
i
heard
he
was
not
he
was
come
from
london
yesterday
morning
that
was
the
first
i
heard
of
him
then
alice
began
again
to
soothe
her
gently
to
tell
her
that
her
husband
was
in
no
great
danger
as
yet
that
he
was
well
known
for
his
loyalty
and
to
do
her
best
to
answer
the
girl
pitiful
questions
and
marjorie
sat
back
and
considered
marjorie
had
a
remarkable
knowledge
of
the
methods
of
the
government
gathered
from
the
almost
endless
stories
she
had
heard
from
travelling
priests
and
others
it
was
her
business
too
to
know
them
two
or
three
things
therefore
if
the
girl
account
was
correct
were
plain
first
that
this
was
a
concerted
plan
and
not
a
mere
chance
arrest
audrey
message
to
her
showed
so
much
and
the
circumstances
of
topcliffe
arrival
confirmed
it
next
it
must
be
more
than
a
simple
blow
struck
at
one
man
thomas
fitzherbert
topcliffe
would
not
have
come
down
from
london
at
all
unless
it
were
a
larger
quarry
than
thomas
that
was
aimed
at
thirdly
and
in
conclusion
it
would
not
be
easy
therefore
to
get
thomas
released
again
there
remained
a
number
of
questions
which
she
had
as
yet
no
means
of
answering
was
it
because
thomas
was
heir
to
the
enormous
fitzherbert
estates
in
this
county
and
elsewhere
that
he
was
struck
at
or
was
it
the
beginning
merely
of
a
general
assault
on
derbyshire
such
as
had
taken
place
before
she
was
born
or
was
it
that
thomas
apparent
coolness
towards
the
faith
for
that
was
evident
by
his
not
having
heard
mass
for
so
long
and
by
his
refusal
to
entertain
priests
just
at
present
was
it
that
lack
of
zeal
on
his
part
which
would
of
course
be
known
to
the
army
of
informers
scattered
now
throughout
england
which
had
marked
him
out
as
the
bird
to
be
flown
at
it
would
be
indeed
a
blow
to
the
catholic
gentry
of
the
county
if
any
of
the
fitzherberts
should
fall
she
stood
up
presently
grave
with
her
thoughts
mistress
alice
glanced
up
i
am
going
out
for
a
little
said
marjorie
but
may
two
of
your
men
follow
me
at
a
little
distance
but
i
shall
be
safe
enough
i
am
going
to
a
friend
house
marjorie
knew
derby
well
enough
from
the
old
days
when
she
rode
in
sometimes
with
her
father
and
slept
at
biddell
and
above
all
she
knew
all
that
derby
had
once
been
in
one
place
outside
the
town
was
where
the
benedictine
nuns
had
lived
leonard
had
had
a
hospital
for
lepers
helen
had
had
the
augustinian
hospital
for
poor
brothers
and
sisters
alkmund
had
held
a
relic
of
its
patron
saint
all
this
she
knew
by
heart
and
it
was
bitter
now
to
be
here
on
such
business
but
she
went
briskly
out
from
the
hall
and
ten
minutes
later
she
was
knocking
at
the
door
of
a
little
attorney
the
old
partner
of
her
father
whose
house
faced
the
guildhall
across
the
little
it
was
opened
by
an
old
woman
who
smiled
at
the
sight
of
her
eh
come
in
mistress
the
master
saw
you
ride
into
town
he
is
in
the
upstairs
parlour
with
mr
bassett
the
girl
nodded
to
her
bodyguard
and
followed
the
old
woman
in
she
bowed
as
she
passed
the
lawyer
confidential
clerk
and
servant
george
beaton
in
the
passage
a
big
man
with
whom
she
had
had
communications
more
than
once
on
popish
affairs
john
biddell
like
marjorie
own
father
and
his
partner
was
one
of
those
quiet
folks
who
live
through
storms
without
attracting
attention
from
the
elements
yet
without
the
sacrifice
of
principle
he
was
a
catholic
and
never
pretended
to
be
anything
else
but
he
was
so
little
and
so
harmless
that
no
man
ever
troubled
him
he
pleaded
before
the
magistrates
unobtrusively
and
deftly
and
would
have
appeared
before
her
grace
herself
or
the
lord
of
hell
with
the
same
timid
and
respectful
air
in
his
spectacles
his
speckless
dark
suit
and
his
little
black
cap
drawn
down
to
his
ears
he
had
communicated
with
marjorie
again
and
again
in
the
last
two
or
three
years
on
the
subject
of
wandering
priests
calling
them
gentlemen
with
the
greatest
care
and
allowing
no
indiscreet
word
ever
to
appear
in
his
letters
he
remembered
king
harry
whom
he
had
seen
once
in
a
visit
of
his
to
london
he
had
assisted
the
legal
authorities
considerably
in
the
restoration
under
queen
mary
and
he
had
soundlessly
acquiesced
in
the
changes
again
under
elizabeth
so
far
at
least
as
mere
law
was
concerned
william
bassett
was
a
very
different
man
first
he
was
the
of
sir
thomas
fitzherbert
himself
and
was
entirely
of
the
proper
spirit
to
mate
with
that
fearless
family
he
had
considerable
estates
both
at
langley
and
blore
in
both
of
which
places
he
cheerfully
evaded
the
new
laws
maintaining
and
helping
priests
in
all
directions
a
man
in
fact
of
an
ardent
and
boisterous
faith
which
he
extended
so
the
report
ran
even
to
magic
and
astrology
a
man
of
means
too
in
spite
of
his
frequent
fines
for
recusancy
and
aged
about
fifty
years
old
at
this
time
with
a
high
colour
in
his
face
and
bright
merry
eyes
marjorie
had
spoken
with
him
once
or
twice
only
these
two
men
then
first
turned
round
in
their
chairs
and
then
stood
up
to
salute
marjorie
as
she
came
into
the
upstairs
parlour
it
was
a
somewhat
dark
room
panelled
where
there
was
space
for
it
between
the
books
and
with
two
windows
looking
out
on
to
the
square
i
thought
we
should
see
you
soon
said
the
attorney
we
saw
you
come
mistress
and
the
fellows
that
cried
out
on
you
they
had
their
deserts
said
marjorie
smiling
bassett
laughed
aloud
indeed
they
did
he
said
in
his
deep
pleasant
voice
there
were
two
of
them
with
bloody
noses
before
all
was
done
you
have
come
for
the
news
i
suppose
mistress
he
eyed
her
genially
and
approvingly
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
this
young
lady
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
and
wished
there
were
more
of
her
kind
that
is
what
i
have
come
for
said
marjorie
we
have
thomas
over
at
babington
house
she
be
of
no
great
service
to
her
husband
said
the
other
she
cries
and
laments
too
much
now
he
stopped
himself
from
paying
his
compliments
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
woman
with
her
fearless
resolute
face
would
do
very
well
without
them
then
he
set
himself
to
relate
the
tale
it
seemed
that
little
thomas
had
given
a
true
enough
report
it
was
true
that
topcliffe
had
arrived
from
london
on
the
morning
of
the
arrest
and
mistress
manners
was
perfectly
right
in
her
opinion
that
this
signified
a
good
deal
but
it
seemed
to
bassett
the
council
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
striking
at
the
fitzherberts
the
quarry
was
too
strong
he
said
for
such
birds
as
the
government
used
too
strong
and
too
many
for
first
no
fitzherbert
had
ever
yet
yielded
in
his
allegiance
either
to
the
church
or
to
the
queen
grace
and
it
was
not
likely
that
thomas
would
begin
and
next
if
one
yielded
and
a
dozen
more
would
spring
up
but
the
position
was
serious
for
all
that
said
bassett
and
biddell
nodded
assent
for
who
would
deal
with
the
estates
and
make
suitable
arrangements
if
the
heir
who
already
largely
controlled
them
were
laid
by
the
heels
but
that
the
largeness
of
the
undertaking
was
recognised
by
the
council
was
plain
enough
in
that
no
less
a
man
than
topcliffe
bassett
spat
on
the
floor
as
he
named
him
topcliffe
the
devil
possessed
by
worse
devils
was
sent
down
to
take
charge
of
the
matter
marjorie
listened
carefully
you
have
no
fear
for
yourself
sir
she
asked
presently
as
the
man
sat
back
in
his
chair
bassett
smiled
broadly
showing
his
strong
white
teeth
between
the
hair
that
fringed
his
lips
no
i
have
no
fear
he
said
i
have
a
score
of
my
men
quartered
in
the
town
and
the
trial
when
will
that
the
trial
why
i
shall
praise
god
if
the
trial
falls
this
year
they
will
harry
him
before
magistrates
no
doubt
and
they
will
squeeze
him
in
private
but
the
trial
why
they
have
not
a
word
of
treason
against
him
and
that
is
what
they
are
after
no
doubt
treason
why
surely
that
is
what
they
seek
to
fasten
upon
us
all
it
would
not
sound
well
that
christian
should
shed
christian
blood
for
christianity
but
that
her
grace
should
sorrowfully
arraign
her
subjects
whom
she
loves
and
cossets
so
much
for
treason
why
that
is
as
sound
a
cause
as
any
in
the
he
smiled
in
a
manner
that
was
almost
a
snarl
and
his
eyes
grew
narrow
with
ironic
merriment
and
thomas
began
marjorie
hesitatingly
he
whisked
his
glance
on
her
like
lightning
thomas
will
laugh
at
them
all
he
cried
he
is
as
staunch
as
any
of
his
blood
i
know
he
has
been
careful
of
late
but
then
you
must
remember
how
all
the
estates
hang
on
him
but
when
he
has
his
back
to
the
wall
or
on
the
rack
for
that
matter
he
will
be
as
stiff
as
iron
they
will
have
their
work
to
bend
him
by
a
hair
breadth
marjorie
drew
a
breath
of
relief
she
did
not
question
judgment
but
she
had
had
an
uneasy
discomfort
in
her
heart
till
he
had
spoken
so
plainly
well
sir
she
said
that
is
what
i
chiefly
came
for
i
wished
to
know
if
i
could
do
aught
for
thomas
or
his
wife
and
you
can
do
a
great
deal
for
his
wife
said
he
you
can
keep
her
quiet
and
comfort
her
she
needs
it
poor
soul
i
have
told
her
for
her
comfort
that
we
shall
have
thomas
out
again
in
a
month
god
forgive
me
for
the
lie
marjorie
stood
up
and
the
men
rose
with
her
why
what
is
that
she
said
and
went
swiftly
to
the
window
for
the
noise
of
the
crying
of
the
cheeses
and
the
murmur
of
voices
had
ceased
all
on
a
sudden
straight
opposite
the
window
where
she
stood
was
the
tiled
flight
of
stairs
that
ran
up
from
the
to
the
first
floor
of
the
guildhall
a
great
building
where
the
business
of
the
town
was
largely
done
and
where
the
magistrates
sat
when
there
was
need
and
a
lane
that
was
clear
of
booths
and
carts
had
been
left
leading
from
that
door
straight
across
the
square
so
that
she
could
see
the
two
little
brobonets
or
iron
guns
that
guarded
the
door
on
either
side
it
was
up
this
lane
that
she
looked
and
down
it
that
there
advanced
a
little
procession
the
very
sight
of
which
it
seemed
had
stricken
the
square
to
silence
already
the
crowd
was
dividing
from
end
to
end
ranging
itself
on
either
side
farmers
men
shambled
out
of
the
way
and
turned
to
see
women
clambered
on
the
carts
holding
up
their
children
to
see
and
from
across
the
square
came
running
that
they
too
might
see
the
steps
of
the
cross
were
already
crowded
with
sightseers
yet
to
outward
sight
the
little
procession
was
ordinary
enough
first
came
three
or
four
of
the
in
livery
carrying
their
staves
then
half
a
dozen
sturdy
fellows
then
a
couple
of
dignified
gentlemen
one
of
them
she
knew
roger
columbell
magistrate
of
the
town
and
then
walking
all
alone
the
figure
of
a
man
tall
and
thin
a
little
rustily
but
very
cleanly
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
who
carried
his
head
stooping
forward
as
if
he
were
looking
on
the
ground
for
something
or
as
if
he
deprecated
so
much
notice
marjorie
saw
no
more
than
this
clearly
she
did
not
notice
the
group
of
men
that
followed
in
case
protection
were
needed
for
the
agent
of
the
council
nor
the
crowd
that
swirled
behind
for
as
the
solitary
figure
came
beneath
the
windows
she
recognised
the
man
whom
she
had
seen
once
in
the
tower
of
london
god
smite
the
man
growled
a
voice
in
her
ear
that
is
topcliffe
going
to
the
prison
i
daresay
and
as
marjorie
turned
her
pale
face
back
she
saw
the
face
of
kindly
bassett
suffused
and
convulsed
with
fury
chapter
ix
i
marjorie
marjorie
wake
up
the
order
hath
come
it
is
for
very
slowly
marjorie
rose
out
of
the
glimmering
depths
of
sleep
into
which
she
had
fallen
on
the
hot
august
afternoon
sunk
down
upon
the
arm
of
the
great
chair
that
stood
by
the
parlour
window
and
saw
thomas
radiant
before
her
waving
a
scrap
of
paper
in
her
hand
nearly
two
months
were
passed
and
as
yet
no
opportunity
had
been
given
to
the
prisoner
wife
to
visit
him
and
during
that
time
it
had
been
impossible
to
go
back
into
the
hills
and
leave
the
girl
alone
the
heat
of
the
summer
had
been
stifling
down
here
in
the
valley
a
huge
plague
of
grasshoppers
had
ravaged
all
england
and
there
were
times
when
even
in
the
outside
derby
their
chirping
had
become
intolerable
the
heat
and
the
necessary
seclusion
and
the
anxiety
had
told
cruelly
upon
the
country
girl
marjorie
face
had
perceptibly
thinned
her
eyes
had
shadows
above
and
beneath
yet
she
knew
she
must
not
go
since
the
young
wife
had
attached
herself
to
her
altogether
finding
alice
she
said
too
dull
for
her
spirits
bassett
was
gone
again
there
was
no
word
of
a
trial
although
there
had
been
a
hearing
or
two
before
the
magistrates
and
it
was
known
that
topcliffe
continually
visited
the
prison
one
piece
of
news
only
had
there
been
to
comfort
her
during
this
time
and
that
that
john
prediction
had
been
fulfilled
with
regard
to
the
captured
priest
garlick
who
back
from
rheims
only
a
few
months
had
been
deported
from
england
since
it
was
his
first
offence
but
he
would
soon
be
over
again
no
doubt
and
next
time
with
death
as
the
stake
in
the
game
marjorie
drew
a
long
breath
and
passed
her
hands
over
her
forehead
the
order
she
said
what
order
the
girl
explained
torrentially
a
man
had
come
just
now
from
the
guildhall
he
had
asked
for
fitzherbert
she
had
gone
down
into
the
hall
to
see
him
and
all
the
rest
of
the
useless
details
but
the
effect
was
that
leave
had
been
given
at
last
to
visit
the
prisoner
for
two
persons
of
which
fitzherbert
must
be
one
and
that
they
must
present
the
order
to
the
gaoler
before
seven
when
they
would
be
admitted
she
looked
such
was
the
constitution
of
her
mind
as
happy
as
if
it
were
an
order
for
his
release
marjorie
drove
away
the
last
shreds
of
sleep
and
kissed
her
that
is
very
good
news
she
said
now
we
will
begin
to
do
something
the
sun
had
sunk
so
far
when
they
set
out
at
last
as
to
throw
the
whole
of
the
square
into
golden
shade
and
in
the
narrow
overhung
friar
gate
where
the
windows
of
the
upper
stories
were
so
near
that
a
man
might
shake
hands
with
his
friend
on
the
other
side
the
twilight
had
already
begun
they
had
determined
to
walk
in
order
less
to
attract
attention
in
spite
of
the
filth
through
which
they
knew
they
must
pass
along
the
couple
of
hundred
yards
that
separated
them
from
the
prison
for
every
housewife
emptied
her
slops
out
of
doors
and
swept
her
house
when
she
did
so
at
all
into
the
same
place
now
and
again
the
heaps
would
be
pushed
together
and
removed
but
for
the
most
part
they
lay
there
bones
and
rags
and
rotten
fruit
dusty
in
one
spot
so
that
all
blew
about
dampened
in
others
where
a
pail
or
two
had
been
poured
forth
the
heat
too
was
stifling
cast
out
again
towards
evening
from
the
roofs
and
walls
that
had
drunk
it
in
all
day
from
the
burning
skies
as
they
stood
before
the
door
at
last
and
waited
after
beating
the
great
iron
knocker
on
the
iron
plate
a
kind
of
despair
came
down
on
marjorie
they
had
advanced
just
so
far
in
two
months
as
to
be
allowed
to
speak
with
the
prisoner
and
from
her
talkings
with
biddell
had
understood
how
little
that
was
indeed
he
had
hinted
to
her
plainly
enough
that
even
in
this
it
might
be
that
they
were
no
more
than
pawns
in
the
enemy
hand
and
that
under
a
show
of
mercy
it
was
often
allowed
for
a
prisoner
friends
to
have
free
access
to
him
in
order
to
shake
his
resolution
if
there
was
any
cause
for
congratulation
then
it
lay
solely
in
the
thought
that
other
means
had
so
far
failed
one
thing
at
least
they
knew
for
their
comfort
that
there
had
been
no
talk
of
torture
it
was
a
full
couple
of
minutes
before
the
door
opened
to
show
them
a
thin
man
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
dressed
over
his
shirt
and
hose
in
a
kind
of
leathern
apron
he
nodded
as
he
saw
the
ladies
with
an
air
of
respect
however
and
stood
aside
to
let
them
come
in
then
with
the
same
civility
he
asked
for
the
order
and
read
it
holding
it
up
to
the
light
that
came
through
the
little
barred
window
over
the
door
it
was
an
unspeakably
dreary
little
entrance
passage
in
which
they
stood
wainscoted
solidly
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
wood
that
looked
damp
and
black
from
age
the
ceiling
itself
was
indistinguishable
in
the
twilight
the
floor
seemed
composed
of
packed
earth
three
or
four
doors
showed
in
the
woodwork
that
opposite
to
the
one
by
which
they
had
entered
stood
slightly
ajar
and
a
smoky
light
shone
from
beyond
it
the
air
was
heavy
and
hot
and
damp
and
smelled
of
mildew
the
man
gave
the
order
back
when
he
had
read
it
made
a
little
gesture
that
resembled
a
bow
and
led
the
way
straight
forward
they
found
themselves
when
they
had
passed
through
the
door
in
another
passage
running
at
to
the
entrance
with
windows
heavily
barred
so
as
to
exclude
all
but
the
faintest
twilight
even
though
the
sun
was
not
yet
set
there
appeared
to
be
foliage
of
some
kind
too
pressing
against
them
from
outside
as
if
a
little
central
yard
lay
there
and
the
light
by
which
alone
they
could
see
their
way
along
the
uneven
earth
floor
came
from
a
flambeau
which
hung
by
the
door
evidently
put
there
just
now
by
the
man
who
had
opened
to
them
he
led
them
down
this
passage
to
the
left
down
a
couple
of
steps
unlocked
another
door
of
enormous
weight
and
thickness
and
closed
this
behind
them
they
found
themselves
in
complete
darkness
i
be
with
you
in
a
moment
mistress
said
his
voice
and
they
heard
his
steps
go
on
into
the
dark
and
cease
marjorie
stood
passive
she
could
feel
the
girl
hands
clasp
her
arm
and
could
hear
her
breath
come
like
sobs
but
before
she
could
speak
a
light
shone
somewhere
on
the
roof
and
almost
immediately
the
man
came
back
carrying
another
flambeau
he
called
to
them
civilly
they
followed
marjorie
once
trod
on
some
soft
damp
thing
that
crackled
beneath
her
foot
they
groped
round
one
more
corner
waited
while
they
heard
a
key
turning
in
a
lock
then
the
man
stood
aside
and
they
went
past
into
the
room
a
figure
was
standing
there
but
for
the
first
moment
they
could
see
no
more
great
shadows
fled
this
way
and
that
as
the
gaoler
hung
up
the
flambeau
then
the
door
closed
again
behind
them
and
elizabeth
flung
herself
into
her
husband
arms
ii
when
marjorie
could
see
him
as
at
last
he
put
his
wife
into
the
single
chair
that
stood
in
the
cell
and
gave
her
the
stool
himself
sitting
upon
the
table
she
was
shocked
by
the
change
in
his
face
it
was
true
that
she
had
only
the
wavering
light
of
the
flambeau
to
see
him
by
for
the
single
barred
window
was
no
more
than
a
pale
glimmer
on
the
wall
yet
even
that
shadowy
illumination
could
not
account
for
his
paleness
and
his
fallen
face
he
was
dressed
miserably
too
his
clothes
were
disordered
and
and
his
features
looked
out
at
once
pinched
and
elongated
he
blinked
a
little
from
time
to
time
his
lips
twitched
beneath
his
moustache
and
beard
and
little
spasms
passed
as
he
talked
across
his
whole
face
it
was
pitiful
to
see
him
and
yet
more
pitiful
to
hear
him
talk
for
he
assumed
a
kind
of
courtesy
mixed
with
bitterness
now
and
again
he
fell
silent
glancing
with
a
swift
and
furtive
movement
of
his
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
visitors
and
back
again
he
attempted
to
apologise
for
the
miserableness
of
the
surroundings
in
which
he
received
them
saying
that
her
grace
his
hostess
could
not
be
everywhere
at
once
and
that
her
guests
must
do
the
best
that
they
could
and
all
this
was
mixed
with
sudden
wails
from
his
wife
sudden
graspings
of
his
hands
by
hers
it
all
seemed
to
the
quiet
girl
who
sat
on
the
little
stool
that
this
was
not
the
way
to
meet
adversity
then
she
drove
down
her
criticism
and
told
herself
that
she
ought
rather
to
admire
one
of
christ
confessors
and
you
bring
me
no
hope
then
mistress
manners
he
said
presently
for
she
had
told
him
that
there
was
no
talk
yet
of
any
formal
trial
no
hope
that
i
may
meet
my
accusers
face
to
face
i
had
thought
perhaps
he
lifted
his
eyes
swiftly
to
hers
and
dropped
them
again
she
shook
her
head
and
yet
that
is
all
that
i
ask
now
only
to
meet
my
accusers
they
can
prove
nothing
against
me
except
indeed
my
recusancy
and
that
they
have
known
this
long
time
back
they
can
prove
nothing
as
to
the
harbouring
of
any
priests
not
within
the
last
year
at
any
rate
for
i
have
not
done
so
it
seemed
to
me
he
stopped
again
and
passed
his
shaking
hand
over
his
mouth
eyeing
the
two
women
with
momentary
glances
and
then
looking
down
once
more
yes
said
marjorie
he
slipped
off
from
the
table
and
began
to
move
about
restlessly
i
have
done
nothing
nothing
at
all
he
said
indeed
i
thought
and
once
more
he
was
silent
he
began
to
talk
presently
of
the
derbyshire
hills
of
padley
and
of
norbury
he
asked
his
wife
of
news
from
home
and
she
gave
it
him
interrupting
herself
with
laments
yet
all
the
while
his
eyes
strayed
to
marjorie
as
if
there
was
something
he
would
ask
of
her
but
could
not
he
seemed
completely
unnerved
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
girl
began
to
understand
something
of
what
must
signify
she
had
heard
of
death
and
the
painful
question
and
she
had
perceived
something
of
the
heroism
that
was
needed
to
meet
them
yet
she
had
never
before
imagined
what
that
life
of
confinement
might
be
until
she
had
watched
this
man
whom
she
had
known
in
the
world
as
a
curt
and
almost
masterful
gentleman
careful
of
his
dress
particular
of
the
deference
that
was
due
to
him
now
become
this
worn
prisoner
careless
of
his
appearance
who
stroked
his
mouth
continually
once
or
twice
gnawing
his
nails
who
paced
about
in
this
abominable
hole
where
a
tumbled
heap
of
straw
and
blankets
represented
a
bed
and
a
rickety
table
with
a
chair
and
a
stool
his
sole
furniture
it
seemed
as
if
a
husk
had
been
stripped
from
him
and
a
shrinking
creature
had
come
out
of
it
which
at
present
she
could
not
recognise
then
he
suddenly
wheeled
on
her
and
for
the
first
time
some
kind
of
forcefulness
appeared
in
his
manner
and
my
uncle
bassett
he
cried
abruptly
what
is
he
doing
all
this
while
marjorie
said
that
bassett
had
been
most
active
on
his
behalf
with
the
lawyers
but
for
the
present
was
gone
back
again
to
his
estates
thomas
snorted
impatiently
yes
he
is
gone
back
again
he
cried
and
he
leaves
me
to
rot
here
he
thinks
that
i
can
bear
it
for
ever
it
seems
bassett
has
done
his
utmost
sir
said
marjorie
he
exposed
himself
here
daily
yes
with
twenty
fellows
to
guard
him
i
suppose
i
know
my
uncle
bassett
ways
tell
me
if
you
please
how
matters
stand
marjorie
explained
again
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
done
until
the
order
came
for
his
trial
or
rather
everything
had
been
done
already
his
lawyers
were
to
rely
exactly
on
the
defence
that
had
been
spoken
of
just
now
it
was
to
be
shown
that
the
prisoner
had
harboured
no
priests
and
the
witnesses
had
already
been
spoken
with
men
from
norbury
and
padley
who
would
swear
that
to
their
certain
knowledge
no
priest
had
been
received
by
fitzherbert
at
least
during
the
previous
year
or
eighteen
months
there
was
therefore
no
kind
of
reason
why
bassett
or
john
fitzherbert
should
remain
any
longer
in
derby
john
had
been
there
but
had
gone
again
under
advice
from
the
lawyers
but
he
was
in
constant
communication
with
biddell
who
had
all
the
papers
ready
and
the
names
of
the
witnesses
and
had
made
more
than
one
application
already
for
the
trial
to
come
on
and
why
has
neither
my
father
nor
my
uncle
bassett
come
to
see
me
snapped
the
man
they
have
tried
again
and
again
sir
said
marjorie
but
permission
was
refused
they
will
no
doubt
try
again
now
that
fitzherbert
has
been
admitted
he
paced
up
and
down
again
for
a
few
steps
without
speaking
then
again
he
turned
on
her
and
she
could
see
his
face
working
uncontrolledly
and
they
will
enjoy
the
estates
they
think
while
i
rot
here
oh
my
thomas
moaned
his
wife
reaching
out
to
him
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
while
i
rot
here
he
cried
again
but
i
will
not
i
tell
you
i
will
not
yes
sir
said
marjorie
gently
suddenly
aware
that
her
heart
had
begun
to
beat
swiftly
he
glanced
at
her
and
his
face
changed
a
little
i
will
not
he
murmured
i
must
break
out
of
my
prison
only
their
accursed
again
he
interrupted
himself
biting
sharply
on
his
lip
for
an
instant
the
girl
had
thought
that
all
her
old
distrust
of
him
was
justified
and
that
he
contemplated
in
some
way
the
making
of
terms
that
would
be
disgraceful
to
a
catholic
but
what
terms
could
these
be
he
was
a
fitzherbert
there
was
no
evading
his
own
blood
and
he
was
the
victim
chosen
by
the
council
to
answer
for
the
rest
nothing
then
except
the
denial
of
his
faith
a
formal
and
deliberate
apostasy
could
serve
him
and
to
think
that
of
the
nephew
of
old
sir
thomas
and
the
son
of
john
was
inconceivable
there
seemed
no
way
out
the
torment
of
this
prison
must
be
borne
she
only
wished
he
could
have
borne
it
more
manfully
it
seemed
as
she
watched
him
that
some
other
train
of
thought
had
fastened
upon
him
his
wife
had
begun
again
her
lamentations
bewailing
his
cell
and
his
clothes
and
his
loss
of
liberty
asking
him
whether
he
were
not
ill
whether
he
had
food
enough
to
eat
and
he
hardly
answered
her
or
glanced
at
her
except
once
when
he
remembered
to
tell
her
that
a
good
gift
to
the
gaoler
would
mean
a
little
better
food
and
perhaps
more
light
for
himself
and
then
he
resumed
his
pacing
and
three
or
four
times
as
he
turned
the
girl
caught
his
eyes
fixed
on
hers
for
one
instant
she
wondered
what
was
in
his
mind
to
say
even
as
she
wondered
there
came
a
single
loud
rap
upon
the
door
and
then
she
heard
the
key
turning
he
wheeled
round
and
seemed
to
come
to
a
determination
my
dearest
he
said
to
his
wife
here
is
the
gaoler
come
to
turn
you
out
again
i
will
ask
him
he
broke
off
as
the
man
stepped
in
gaoler
he
said
my
wife
would
speak
alone
with
you
a
moment
he
nodded
and
winked
at
his
wife
as
if
to
tell
her
that
this
was
the
time
to
give
him
the
money
will
you
leave
mistress
manners
here
for
a
minute
or
two
while
my
wife
speaks
with
you
in
the
passage
then
marjorie
understood
that
she
had
been
right
the
man
who
held
the
keys
nodded
without
speaking
then
my
dearest
wife
said
thomas
embracing
her
all
of
a
sudden
and
simultaneously
drawing
her
towards
the
door
we
will
leave
you
to
speak
with
the
man
he
will
come
back
for
mistress
manners
directly
oh
my
thomas
wailed
the
girl
clinging
to
him
there
there
my
dearest
and
you
will
come
and
see
me
again
as
soon
as
you
can
get
the
order
the
instant
the
door
was
closed
he
came
up
to
marjorie
and
his
face
looked
ghastly
mistress
manners
he
said
i
dare
not
speak
to
my
wife
but
but
for
jesu
sake
get
me
out
of
here
i
i
can
not
bear
it
topcliffe
comes
to
see
me
every
day
he
he
speaks
to
me
continually
of
o
christ
christ
i
can
not
bear
it
he
dropped
suddenly
on
to
his
knees
by
the
table
and
hid
his
face
iii
at
babington
house
marjorie
slept
as
was
often
the
custom
in
the
same
room
with
her
maid
a
large
low
room
hung
all
round
with
painted
cloths
above
the
low
wainscoting
on
the
night
after
the
visit
to
the
prison
janet
noticed
that
her
mistress
was
restless
and
that
while
she
would
say
nothing
of
what
was
troubling
her
and
only
bade
her
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
she
herself
would
not
go
to
bed
at
last
in
sheer
weariness
the
maid
slept
she
awakened
later
at
what
time
she
did
not
know
and
in
her
uneasiness
sat
up
and
looked
about
her
and
there
still
before
the
crucifix
where
she
had
seen
her
before
she
slept
kneeled
her
mistress
she
cried
out
in
a
loud
whisper
come
to
bed
mistress
come
to
bed
and
at
the
word
marjorie
started
then
she
rose
turned
and
in
the
twilight
of
the
summer
night
began
to
prepare
herself
for
bed
without
speaking
far
away
across
the
roofs
of
derby
came
the
crowing
of
a
cock
to
greet
the
dawn
chapter
x
i
it
was
a
fortnight
later
that
there
came
suddenly
to
babington
house
old
biddell
himself
up
to
the
present
he
had
been
careful
not
to
do
so
he
appeared
in
the
great
hall
an
hour
before
as
the
tables
were
being
set
and
sent
a
servant
for
mistress
manners
hark
you
he
said
you
need
not
rouse
the
whole
house
it
is
with
mistress
manners
alone
that
my
business
lies
he
broke
off
as
fitzherbert
looked
over
the
gallery
mr
biddell
she
cried
he
shook
his
head
but
he
seemed
to
speak
with
some
difficulty
it
is
just
a
rumour
he
said
such
as
there
hath
been
before
i
beg
you
that
there
will
be
no
trial
at
all
it
is
just
a
rumour
he
repeated
i
did
not
even
come
to
trouble
you
with
it
it
is
with
mistress
manners
that
i
am
coming
down
cried
thomas
and
vanished
from
the
gallery
biddell
acted
with
decision
he
whisked
out
again
into
the
passage
from
the
court
and
there
ran
straight
into
marjorie
who
was
coming
in
from
the
little
enclosed
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
quick
he
said
quick
thomas
is
coming
and
i
do
not
wish
she
led
the
way
without
a
word
back
into
the
court
along
a
few
steps
and
up
again
to
the
house
into
a
little
back
parlour
that
the
steward
used
when
the
house
was
full
it
was
unoccupied
now
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
whence
she
was
just
come
she
locked
the
door
when
he
had
entered
and
came
and
sat
down
out
of
sight
of
any
that
might
be
passing
sit
here
she
said
and
then
well
she
asked
he
looked
at
her
gravely
and
sadly
shaking
his
head
once
or
twice
then
he
drew
out
a
paper
or
two
from
a
little
lawyer
valise
that
he
carried
and
as
he
did
so
heard
a
hand
try
the
door
outside
that
is
thomas
whispered
the
girl
she
will
not
find
us
he
waited
till
the
steps
moved
away
again
then
he
began
he
looked
anxious
and
dejected
i
fear
it
is
precisely
as
you
thought
he
said
i
have
followed
up
every
rumour
in
the
place
and
the
first
thing
that
is
certain
is
that
topcliffe
leaves
derby
in
two
days
from
now
i
had
it
as
positive
information
that
his
men
have
orders
to
prepare
for
it
the
second
thing
is
that
topcliffe
is
greatly
elated
and
the
third
is
that
fitzherbert
will
be
released
as
soon
as
topcliffe
is
gone
you
are
sure
this
time
sir
he
assented
by
a
movement
of
his
head
i
dared
not
tell
thomas
just
now
she
would
give
me
no
peace
i
said
it
was
but
a
rumour
and
so
it
is
but
it
is
a
rumour
that
hath
truth
behind
it
he
hath
been
moved
too
these
three
days
back
to
another
cell
and
hath
every
comfort
he
shook
his
head
again
but
he
hath
made
no
promise
began
marjorie
breathlessly
it
is
exactly
that
which
i
am
most
afraid
of
said
the
lawyer
if
he
had
yielded
and
consented
to
go
to
church
it
would
have
been
in
every
man
mouth
by
now
but
he
hath
not
and
i
should
fear
it
less
if
he
had
that
the
very
worst
part
of
my
news
i
do
not
understand
biddell
tapped
his
papers
on
the
table
if
he
were
an
open
and
confessed
enemy
i
should
fear
it
less
he
repeated
it
is
not
that
but
he
must
have
given
some
promise
to
topcliffe
that
pleases
the
fellow
more
and
what
can
that
be
but
that
marjorie
turned
yet
whiter
she
sighed
once
as
if
to
steady
herself
she
could
not
speak
but
she
nodded
yes
mistress
manners
said
the
old
man
i
make
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
hath
promised
to
assist
him
against
them
all
against
john
his
father
it
may
be
or
bassett
or
god
knows
whom
and
yet
still
feigning
to
be
true
and
that
is
not
all
she
looked
at
him
she
could
not
conceive
worse
than
this
if
indeed
it
were
true
and
do
you
think
he
continued
that
topcliffe
will
do
all
this
for
love
or
rather
for
mere
malice
i
have
heard
more
of
the
fellow
since
he
hath
been
in
derby
than
in
all
my
life
before
and
i
tell
you
he
is
for
feathering
his
own
nest
if
he
can
he
stopped
mistress
did
you
know
that
he
had
been
out
to
padley
three
or
four
times
since
he
came
to
derby
well
i
tell
you
now
that
he
has
john
was
away
praise
god
but
the
fellow
went
all
round
the
place
and
greatly
admired
it
he
went
out
to
see
what
he
could
find
asked
the
girl
still
whispering
the
other
shook
his
head
no
mistress
he
searched
nothing
i
had
it
all
from
one
of
his
fellows
through
one
of
mine
he
searched
nothing
he
sat
a
great
while
in
the
garden
and
ate
some
of
the
fruit
he
went
through
the
hall
and
the
rooms
and
admired
all
that
was
to
be
seen
there
he
went
up
into
the
too
though
there
was
nothing
there
to
tell
him
what
it
was
and
he
talked
a
great
while
to
one
of
the
men
about
the
farms
and
the
grazing
and
but
he
meddled
with
nothing
the
old
face
suddenly
wrinkled
into
fury
the
devil
went
through
it
all
like
that
and
admired
it
and
he
came
out
to
it
again
two
or
three
times
and
did
the
like
he
stopped
to
examine
the
notes
he
had
made
and
marjorie
sat
still
staring
on
him
it
was
worse
than
anything
she
could
have
conceived
possible
that
a
fitzherbert
should
apostatise
was
incredible
enough
but
that
one
should
sell
his
family
it
was
impossible
biddell
she
whispered
piteously
it
can
not
be
it
is
some
he
shook
his
head
suddenly
and
fiercely
mistress
manners
it
is
as
plain
as
daylight
to
me
do
you
think
i
could
believe
it
without
proof
i
tell
you
i
have
lain
awake
all
last
night
fitting
matters
one
into
the
other
i
did
not
hear
about
padley
till
last
night
and
it
gave
me
all
that
i
needed
i
tell
you
topcliffe
hath
cast
his
foul
eyes
on
padley
and
coveted
it
and
he
hath
demanded
it
as
a
price
for
thomas
liberty
i
do
not
know
what
else
he
hath
promised
but
i
will
stake
my
fortune
that
padley
is
part
of
it
that
is
why
he
is
so
elated
he
hath
been
here
nearly
this
three
months
back
he
hath
visited
fitzherbert
nigh
every
day
he
hath
cajoled
him
he
hath
threatened
him
he
hath
worn
out
his
spirit
by
the
gaol
and
the
stinking
food
and
the
loneliness
and
he
hath
prevailed
as
he
hath
prevailed
with
many
another
and
the
end
of
it
all
is
that
fitzherbert
hath
yielded
yet
not
openly
maybe
that
is
part
of
the
bargain
upon
the
other
side
that
he
should
keep
his
name
before
the
world
and
on
this
side
he
hath
promised
padley
if
that
he
may
but
keep
the
rest
of
the
estates
and
have
his
liberty
i
tell
you
that
alone
cuts
all
the
knots
of
this
tangle
can
you
cut
them
in
any
other
manner
there
was
a
long
silence
from
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
came
the
sound
of
cheerful
voices
and
the
clatter
of
lids
and
from
the
walled
garden
outside
the
chatter
of
birds
at
last
the
girl
spoke
i
can
not
believe
it
without
evidence
she
said
it
may
be
so
god
knows
but
i
do
not
mr
biddell
well
mistress
the
lawyer
head
was
sunk
on
his
breast
he
spoke
listlessly
he
will
have
given
some
writing
to
topcliffe
will
he
not
if
this
be
true
topcliffe
is
not
the
man
the
old
man
lifted
his
head
sharply
then
he
nodded
that
is
the
shrewd
truth
mistress
topcliffe
will
not
trust
to
another
honour
he
hath
none
of
his
own
well
said
marjorie
if
all
this
be
true
topcliffe
will
already
have
that
writing
in
his
possession
she
paused
eh
said
the
lawyer
they
looked
at
one
another
again
in
silence
it
would
have
seemed
to
another
that
the
two
minds
talked
swiftly
and
wordlessly
together
the
trained
thought
of
the
lawyer
and
the
quick
wit
of
the
woman
for
when
the
man
spoke
again
it
was
as
if
they
had
spoken
at
length
but
we
must
not
destroy
the
paper
he
said
or
the
fat
will
be
in
the
fire
we
must
not
let
fitzherbert
know
that
he
is
found
out
no
said
the
girl
but
to
get
a
view
of
it
and
a
copy
of
it
to
send
to
his
family
again
the
two
looked
each
at
the
other
in
silence
as
if
they
were
equals
the
old
man
and
the
girl
ii
it
was
the
last
night
before
the
londoners
were
to
return
they
had
lived
royally
these
last
three
months
the
agent
of
the
council
had
had
a
couple
of
the
best
rooms
in
the
inn
that
looked
on
to
the
where
he
entertained
his
friends
and
now
and
then
a
magistrate
or
two
even
audrey
of
matstead
had
come
to
him
once
there
with
another
but
had
refused
to
stay
to
supper
and
had
ridden
away
again
alone
downstairs
too
his
men
had
fared
very
well
indeed
they
knew
how
to
make
themselves
respected
for
they
carried
arms
always
now
since
the
unfortunate
affair
a
day
after
the
arrival
when
two
of
them
had
been
gravely
battered
about
by
two
rustic
servants
who
they
learned
were
members
of
a
popish
household
in
the
town
but
all
the
provincial
fellows
were
not
like
this
there
was
a
big
man
half
clerk
and
half
to
a
poor
little
lawyer
who
lived
across
the
square
a
man
of
no
wit
indeed
but
at
any
rate
one
of
means
and
of
generosity
too
as
they
had
lately
found
out
means
and
generosity
they
understood
that
were
made
possible
by
the
unknowing
assistance
of
his
master
in
a
word
it
was
believed
among
topcliffe
men
that
all
the
refreshment
which
they
had
lately
enjoyed
beyond
that
provided
by
their
master
was
at
old
biddell
expense
though
he
did
not
know
it
and
that
george
beaton
fool
though
he
was
was
a
cleverer
man
than
his
employer
lately
too
they
had
come
to
learn
that
although
george
beaton
was
half
clerk
half
to
a
papist
he
was
yet
at
heart
as
stout
a
protestant
as
themselves
though
he
dared
not
declare
it
for
fear
of
losing
his
place
on
this
last
night
they
made
very
merry
indeed
and
once
or
twice
the
landlord
pushed
his
head
through
the
doorway
the
baggage
was
packed
and
all
was
in
readiness
for
a
start
soon
after
dawn
there
came
a
time
when
george
beaton
said
that
he
was
stifling
with
the
heat
and
indeed
in
this
room
after
supper
with
the
little
windows
looking
on
to
the
court
the
heat
was
surprising
the
men
sat
in
their
shirts
and
trunks
so
that
it
was
as
natural
as
possible
that
george
should
rise
from
his
place
and
sit
down
again
close
to
the
door
where
the
cool
air
from
the
passage
came
in
and
from
there
once
more
he
led
the
talk
in
his
character
of
rustic
and
boor
he
even
beat
the
sullen
man
who
was
next
him
genially
over
the
head
to
make
him
give
more
room
and
then
he
proposed
a
toast
to
topcliffe
it
was
about
half
an
hour
later
when
george
was
becoming
a
little
anxious
that
he
drew
out
at
last
a
statement
that
topcliffe
had
a
great
valise
upstairs
full
of
papers
that
had
to
do
with
his
law
business
he
had
tried
for
this
piece
of
information
last
night
and
the
night
before
but
had
failed
to
obtain
it
ten
minutes
later
again
then
when
the
talk
had
moved
to
affairs
of
the
journey
and
the
valise
had
been
forgotten
it
was
an
entirely
unsuspicious
circumstance
that
george
and
the
man
that
sat
next
him
should
slip
out
to
take
the
air
in
the
the
londoner
was
so
fuddled
with
drink
as
to
think
that
he
had
gone
out
at
his
own
deliberate
wish
and
there
in
the
fresh
air
the
inevitable
result
followed
his
head
swam
and
he
leaned
on
big
george
for
support
and
here
by
the
one
stroke
of
luck
that
visited
poor
george
this
evening
it
fell
that
he
was
just
in
time
to
see
topcliffe
himself
pass
the
archway
in
the
direction
of
gate
in
company
with
a
magistrate
who
had
supped
with
him
upstairs
up
to
this
point
george
had
moved
blindly
step
by
step
he
had
had
his
instructions
from
his
master
yet
all
that
he
had
been
able
to
determine
was
the
general
plan
to
find
out
where
the
papers
were
kept
to
remain
in
the
inn
till
the
last
possible
moment
and
to
watch
for
any
chance
that
might
open
to
him
truly
he
had
no
more
than
that
except
indeed
a
vague
idea
that
it
might
be
necessary
to
bribe
one
of
the
men
to
rob
his
master
yet
there
was
everything
against
this
and
it
was
indeed
a
last
resort
it
seemed
now
however
that
another
way
was
open
it
was
exceedingly
probable
that
topcliffe
was
off
for
his
last
visit
to
the
prisoner
and
since
a
magistrate
was
with
him
it
was
exceedingly
improbable
that
he
would
take
the
paper
with
him
it
was
not
the
kind
of
paper
if
indeed
it
existed
at
all
that
more
persons
would
be
allowed
to
see
than
were
parties
to
the
very
discreditable
affair
and
now
george
spoke
earnestly
and
convincingly
he
desired
to
see
the
baggage
of
so
great
a
man
as
topcliffe
he
had
heard
so
much
of
him
his
friend
was
a
good
fellow
who
trusted
him
here
george
embraced
him
warmly
surely
such
a
little
thing
would
be
allowed
as
for
him
george
to
step
in
and
view
topcliffe
baggage
while
the
faithful
servant
kept
watch
in
the
passage
perhaps
another
glass
of
ale
iii
yes
sir
said
george
an
hour
later
still
a
little
flushed
with
the
amount
of
drink
he
had
been
forced
to
consume
i
had
some
trouble
to
get
it
but
i
think
this
is
what
your
honour
wanted
he
began
to
search
in
his
deep
tell
me
said
biddell
i
got
the
fellow
to
watch
in
the
passage
sir
him
that
i
had
made
drunk
while
i
was
inside
there
were
great
bundles
of
papers
in
the
valise
no
sir
it
was
strapped
up
only
the
most
of
the
papers
were
docketed
very
legally
sir
so
i
did
not
have
to
search
long
there
were
three
or
four
papers
in
a
little
packet
by
themselves
besides
a
great
packet
that
was
endorsed
with
fitzherbert
name
as
well
as
topcliffe
and
my
lord
shrewsbury
and
i
think
i
should
not
have
had
time
to
look
that
through
but
by
god
mercy
it
was
one
of
the
three
or
four
by
themselves
he
had
the
paper
in
his
hand
by
now
the
lawyer
made
a
movement
to
take
it
then
he
restrained
himself
tell
me
first
he
said
well
sir
said
george
with
a
pardonable
satisfaction
in
spinning
the
matter
out
one
was
all
covered
with
notes
and
was
headed
i
read
that
through
sir
it
had
to
do
with
the
buildings
and
the
acres
and
so
forth
the
second
paper
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
was
in
cypher
i
think
the
third
paper
was
the
same
and
the
fourth
sir
was
that
which
i
have
here
the
lawyer
started
but
i
told
you
yes
sir
i
should
have
said
that
this
is
the
copy
or
at
least
an
abstract
i
made
the
abstract
by
the
window
sir
crouching
down
so
that
none
should
see
me
then
i
put
all
back
as
before
and
came
out
again
the
fellow
was
fast
asleep
against
the
door
and
topcliffe
topcliffe
sir
returned
half
an
hour
afterwards
in
company
again
with
hamilton
i
waited
a
few
minutes
to
see
that
all
was
well
and
then
i
came
to
you
sir
there
was
silence
in
the
little
room
for
a
moment
it
was
the
small
back
office
of
biddell
where
he
did
his
more
intimate
business
looking
out
on
to
a
paved
court
the
town
was
for
the
most
part
asleep
and
hardly
a
sound
came
through
the
closed
windows
then
the
lawyer
turned
and
put
out
his
hand
for
the
paper
without
a
word
he
nodded
to
george
who
went
out
bidding
him
ten
minutes
later
biddell
walked
quietly
through
the
gate
by
the
side
of
the
great
doors
that
led
to
the
court
beside
babington
house
closing
it
behind
him
he
knew
that
it
would
be
left
unbarred
till
eleven
that
night
he
passed
on
through
the
court
past
the
house
door
to
the
steward
office
where
through
heavy
curtains
a
light
glimmered
as
he
put
his
hand
on
the
door
it
opened
and
marjorie
was
there
he
said
nothing
nor
did
she
her
face
was
pale
and
steady
and
there
was
a
question
in
her
eyes
for
answer
he
put
the
paper
into
her
hands
and
sat
down
while
she
read
it
the
stillness
was
as
deep
here
as
in
the
office
he
had
just
left
iv
it
was
a
minute
or
two
before
either
spoke
the
girl
read
the
paper
twice
through
holding
it
close
to
the
little
that
stood
on
the
table
you
see
mistress
he
said
it
is
as
bad
as
it
can
be
she
handed
back
the
paper
to
him
he
slid
out
his
spectacles
put
them
on
and
held
the
writing
to
the
light
here
are
the
points
you
see
he
went
on
i
have
annotated
them
in
the
margin
first
that
thomas
fitzherbert
be
released
from
derby
gaol
within
three
days
from
the
leaving
of
topcliffe
for
london
and
that
he
be
no
more
troubled
neither
in
fines
nor
imprisonment
next
that
he
have
secured
to
him
so
far
as
the
laws
shall
permit
all
his
inheritance
from
sir
thomas
from
his
father
and
from
any
other
bequests
whether
of
his
or
no
thirdly
that
topcliffe
do
to
the
death
the
lawyer
paused
cast
a
glance
at
the
downcast
face
of
the
girl
do
persecute
to
the
death
his
uncle
sir
thomas
his
father
john
and
william
bassett
his
kinsman
and
in
return
for
all
this
thomas
fitzherbert
shall
become
her
grace
sworn
servant
that
is
mistress
manners
her
grace
spy
pursuivant
informer
and
and
that
he
shall
grant
and
secure
to
richard
topcliffe
esquire
and
to
his
heirs
for
ever
manors
of
over
padley
and
nether

of
hathersage
in
consideration
of
eight
hundred
marks
of
silver
to
be
paid
to
thomas
fitzherbert
esquire
etc
the
lawyer
put
the
paper
down
and
pushed
his
spectacles
on
to
his
forehead
that
is
a
legal
instrument
asked
the
girl
quietly
still
with
downcast
eyes
it
is
not
yet
fully
completed
but
it
is
signed
and
witnessed
it
can
become
a
legal
instrument
by
topcliffe
act
and
it
would
pass
muster
it
is
signed
by
mr
thomas
he
nodded
she
was
silent
again
he
began
to
tell
her
of
how
he
had
obtained
it
and
of
george
subtlety
and
good
fortune
but
she
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
she
sat
perfectly
still
when
he
had
ended
she
spoke
again
a
sworn
servant
of
her
grace
she
began
topcliffe
is
a
sworn
servant
of
her
grace
he
said
bitterly
you
may
judge
by
that
what
thomas
fitzherbert
hath
become
we
shall
have
his
hand
too
against
us
all
then
yes
mistress
and
what
is
worse
this
paper
i
take
it
he
tapped
it
this
paper
is
to
be
a
secret
for
the
present
thomas
will
still
feign
himself
to
be
a
catholic
with
catholics
until
he
comes
into
all
his
inheritances
and
meantime
he
will
supply
information
to
his
new
masters
why
can
not
we
expose
him
where
is
the
proof
he
will
deny
it
she
paused
we
can
at
least
tell
his
family
you
will
draw
up
the
informations
i
will
do
so
and
send
them
to
sir
thomas
and
mr
bassett
i
will
do
so
that
may
perhaps
prevent
his
inheritance
coming
to
him
as
quickly
as
he
thinks
the
lawyer
eyes
gleamed
and
what
of
thomas
mistress
marjorie
lifted
her
eyes
i
do
not
think
a
great
deal
of
thomas
she
said
she
is
honest
i
think
but
she
could
not
be
trusted
with
a
secret
but
i
will
tell
mistress
babington
and
i
will
warn
what
priests
i
can
and
if
it
leaks
out
it
must
leak
out
and
yourself
can
you
meet
thomas
again
just
now
he
will
be
out
in
three
days
marjorie
drew
a
long
breath
no
sir
i
can
not
meet
him
i
should
betray
what
i
felt
i
shall
make
excuses
to
thomas
and
go
home
part

chapter
i
i
the
red
bull
in
cheapside
was
all
alight
a
party
had
arrived
there
from
the
coast
not
an
hour
ago
and
the
rooms
that
had
been
bespoken
by
courier
occupied
the
greater
part
of
the
second
floor
the
rest
of
the
house
was
already
filled
by
another
large
company
spoken
for
by
babington
although
he
himself
was
not
one
of
them
and
it
seemed
to
the
shrewd
landlord
that
these
two
parties
were
not
wholly
unknown
to
one
another
although
as
a
discreet
man
he
said
nothing
the
latest
arrived
party
was
plainly
come
from
the
coast
they
had
arrived
a
little
after
sunset
on
this
stormy
august
day
splashed
to
the
shoulders
by
the
and
drenched
to
the
skin
by
the
heavy
their
baggage
had
a
battered
and
air
about
it
and
the
landlord
thought
he
would
not
be
far
away
if
he
conjectured
rheims
as
their
there
were
three
gentlemen
in
the
party
and
four
servants
apparently
but
he
knew
better
than
to
ask
questions
or
to
overhear
what
seemed
rather
conversation
between
the
men
and
their
masters
there
was
only
one
however
whom
he
remembered
to
have
lodged
before
over
five
years
ago
the
name
of
this
one
was
alban
but
all
this
was
not
his
business
his
duty
was
to
be
hearty
and
deferential
and
entirely
stupid
and
certainly
this
course
of
behaviour
brought
him
a
quantity
of
guests
alban
about
nine
had
finished
unstrapping
his
luggage
it
was
of
the
most
innocent
description
and
contained
nothing
that
all
the
world
might
not
see
he
had
made
arrangements
that
articles
of
another
kind
should
come
over
from
rheims
under
the
care
of
one
of
the
servants
whose
baggage
would
be
less
suspected
the
distribution
would
take
place
in
a
day
or
two
these
articles
comprised
five
sets
of
altar
vessels
five
sets
of
made
of
a
stuff
woven
of
all
the
liturgical
colours
together
a
dozen
books
a
box
of
medals
another
of
little
wax
medallions
stamped
with
the
figure
of
a
lamb
supporting
a
banner
a
bunch
of
beads
and
a
heavy
little
square
package
of
very
thin
as
he
laid
out
the
suit
of
clothes
that
he
proposed
to
wear
next
day
there
was
a
rapping
on
his
door
babington
is
come
sir
the
last
word
was
added
as
an
obvious
afterthought
in
case
of
listeners
robin
sprang
up
the
door
was
opened
by
his
servant
and
anthony
came
in
smiling
anthony
babington
had
broadened
and
aged
considerably
during
the
last
five
years
he
was
still
but
he
was
plainly
a
man
and
no
longer
a
boy
and
he
presently
said
as
much
for
his
friend
you
are
a
man
robin
he
why
it
slipped
my
mind
he
knelt
down
promptly
on
the
strip
of
carpet
and
kissed
the
palms
of
the
hands
held
out
to
him
as
is
the
custom
to
do
with
priests
and
robin
murmured
a
blessing
then
the
two
sat
down
again
and
now
for
the
news
said
robin
anthony
face
grew
grave
yours
first
he
said
so
robin
told
him
he
had
been
ordained
priest
a
month
ago
at
the
college
was
as
full
as
it
could
hold
they
had
had
an
unadventurous
journey
anthony
put
a
question
or
two
and
was
answered
and
now
said
robin
what
of
derbyshire
and
of
the
country
and
of
my
father
and
is
it
true
that
ballard
is
taken
anthony
threw
an
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
tried
to
seem
at
his
ease
well
he
said
derbyshire
is
as
it
ever
was
you
heard
of
thomas
fitzherbert
defection
mistress
manners
wrote
to
me
of
it
more
than
two
years
ago
well
he
does
what
he
can
he
comes
and
goes
with
his
wife
or
without
her
but
he
comes
no
more
to
padley
and
he
scarcely
makes
a
feint
even
before
strangers
of
being
a
catholic
though
he
has
not
declared
himself
nor
gone
to
church
at
any
rate
in
his
own
county
here
in
london
i
have
seen
him
more
than
once
in
topcliffe
company
but
i
think
that
every
catholic
in
the
country
knows
of
it
by
now
that
is
mistress
manners
doing
my
sister
says
there
has
never
been
a
woman
like
her
robin
eyes
twinkled
i
always
said
so
he
said
but
none
would
believe
me
she
has
the
wit
and
courage
of
twenty
men
what
has
she
been
doing
what
has
she
not
done
cried
anthony
she
keeps
herself
for
the
most
part
in
her
house
and
my
sister
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
with
her
but
her
men
who
would
die
for
her
i
think
go
everywhere
and
half
the
and
shepherds
of
the
peak
are
her
sworn
men
i
have
given
your
dick
to
her
he
was
mad
to
do
what
he
could
in
that
cause
so
her
men
go
this
way
and
that
bearing
her
letters
or
her
messages
to
priests
who
are
on
their
way
through
the
county
and
she
gets
news
god
knows
how
of
what
is
against
us
she
has
saved
ludlam
twice
and
garlick
once
as
well
as
simpson
once
by
getting
the
news
to
them
of
the
pursuivants
coming
and
having
them
away
into
the
peak
and
yet
with
all
this
she
has
never
been
laid
by
the
heels
have
they
been
after
her
then
asked
robin
eagerly
they
have
had
a
spy
in
her
house
twice
to
my
knowledge
but
never
openly
and
never
a
shred
of
a
priest
gown
to
be
seen
though
mass
had
been
said
there
that
day
but
they
have
never
searched
it
by
force
and
i
think
they
do
not
truly
suspect
her
at
all
did
i
not
say
so
cried
robin
and
what
of
my
father
he
wrote
to
me
that
he
was
to
be
made
magistrate
and
i
have
never
written
to
him
since
he
hath
been
made
magistrate
said
anthony
drily
and
he
sits
on
the
bench
with
the
rest
of
them
then
he
is
all
of
the
same
mind
i
know
nothing
of
his
mind
i
have
never
spoken
with
him
this
six
years
back
i
know
his
acts
only
his
name
was
in
the
of
association
too
i
have
heard
of
that
why
it
is
two
years
old
now
half
the
gentry
of
england
have
joined
it
said
anthony
bitterly
it
is
to
persecute
to
the
death
any
pretender
to
the
crown
other
than
our
eliza
there
was
a
pause
robin
understood
the
bitterness
and
what
of
mr
ballard
asked
robin
yes
he
is
taken
said
anthony
slowly
watching
him
he
was
taken
a
week
ago
will
they
banish
him
then
i
think
they
will
banish
him
why
yes
it
is
the
first
time
he
hath
been
taken
and
there
is
nothing
great
against
him
i
think
there
is
not
said
anthony
still
with
that
strange
deliberateness
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
anthony
stood
up
without
answering
then
he
began
to
pace
about
as
he
passed
the
door
he
looked
to
the
bolt
carefully
then
he
turned
again
to
his
friend
robin
he
said
would
you
sooner
know
a
truth
that
will
make
you
unhappy
or
be
ignorant
of
it
does
it
concern
myself
or
my
business
asked
robin
promptly
it
concerns
you
and
every
priest
and
every
catholic
in
england
it
is
what
i
have
hinted
to
you
before
then
i
will
hear
it
it
is
as
if
i
told
it
in
confession
robin
paused
you
may
make
it
so
he
said
if
you
choose
anthony
looked
at
him
an
instant
well
he
said
i
will
not
make
a
confession
because
there
is
no
use
in
that
now
but
well
listen
he
said
and
sat
down
ii
when
he
ceased
robin
lifted
his
head
he
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
you
have
been
refused
absolution
before
for
this
i
was
refused
absolution
by
two
priests
but
i
was
granted
it
by
a
third
let
me
see
that
i
have
the
tale
right
yourself
with
a
number
of
others
have
bound
yourselves
by
an
oath
to
kill
her
grace
and
to
set
mary
on
the
throne
this
has
taken
shape
now
since
the
beginning
of
the
summer
you
yourself
are
now
living
in
walsingham
house
in
seething
lane
under
the
patronage
of
her
grace
and
you
show
yourself
freely
at
court
you
have
proceeded
so
far
under
fear
of
ballard
arrest
as
to
provide
one
of
your
company
with
clothes
and
necessaries
that
can
enable
him
to
go
to
court
and
it
was
your
intention
as
well
as
his
that
he
should
take
opportunity
to
kill
her
grace
but
only
you
have
become
persuaded
that
the
old
design
was
the
better
and
you
wish
first
to
arrange
matters
with
the
queen
of
the
scots
so
that
when
all
is
ready
you
may
be
the
more
sure
of
a
rising
when
that
her
grace
is
killed
and
that
the
duke
of
parma
may
be
in
readiness
to
bring
an
army
into
england
it
is
still
your
intention
to
kill
her
grace
by
god
it
is
said
anthony
between
clenched
teeth
then
i
could
not
absolve
you
even
if
you
came
to
confession
you
may
be
absolved
from
your
allegiance
as
we
all
are
but
you
are
not
absolved
from
charity
and
justice
towards
elizabeth
as
a
woman
i
have
consulted
theologians
on
the
very
point
and
then
anthony
sprang
up
see
here
robin
we
must
talk
this
out
he
flicked
his
fingers
sharply
see
we
will
talk
of
it
as
two
friends
you
had
better
take
back
those
words
said
the
priest
gravely
why
it
would
be
my
duty
to
lay
an
information
i
understood
you
spoke
to
me
as
to
a
priest
though
not
in
confession
you
would
blazed
the
other
i
should
do
so
in
conscience
said
the
priest
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
as
a
friend
and
you
mean
i
mean
that
so
long
as
you
choose
to
speak
to
me
of
it
now
and
here
it
remains
that
i
choose
to
regard
it
as
in
effect
but
you
must
not
come
to
me
as
if
i
knew
it
all
in
a
plain
way
i
do
not
i
know
it
as
a
priest
only
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
anthony
stood
up
i
understand
he
said
but
you
would
refuse
me
absolution
in
any
case
i
could
not
give
you
absolution
so
long
as
you
intended
to
kill
her
grace
anthony
made
an
impatient
gesture
see
here
he
said
let
me
tell
you
the
whole
matter
from
the
beginning
now
listen
he
settled
himself
again
in
his
chair
and
began
robin
he
said
you
remember
when
i
spoke
to
you
in
the
inn
on
the
way
to
matstead
it
must
be
seven
or
eight
years
gone
now
well
that
was
when
the
beginning
was
there
was
no
design
then
such
as
we
have
but
the
general
purpose
was
there
i
had
spoken
with
man
after
man
i
had
been
to
france
and
seen
morgan
there
queen
mary
man
and
my
lord
of
glasgow
and
all
that
i
spoke
with
seemed
of
one
mind
except
my
lord
of
glasgow
who
did
not
say
much
to
me
on
the
matter
but
all
at
least
were
agreed
that
there
would
be
no
peace
in
england
so
long
as
elizabeth
sat
on
the
throne
well
it
was
after
that
that
i
fell
in
with
ballard
who
was
over
here
on
some
other
affair
and
i
found
him
a
man
of
the
same
mind
as
myself
he
was
all
agog
for
mary
and
seemed
afraid
of
nothing
well
nothing
was
done
for
a
great
while
he
wrote
to
me
from
france
i
wrote
back
to
him
again
telling
him
the
names
of
some
of
my
friends
i
went
to
see
him
in
france
two
or
three
times
and
i
saw
him
here
when
you
yourself
came
over
with
him
but
we
did
not
know
whom
to
trust
neither
had
we
any
special
design
her
grace
of
the
scots
went
hither
and
thither
under
strong
guards
and
what
i
had
done
for
her
before
robin
looked
up
he
was
still
quite
pale
and
quite
quiet
what
was
that
he
said
anthony
again
made
his
impatient
gesture
he
was
fiercely
excited
but
kept
himself
under
tolerable
control
why
i
have
been
her
agent
for
a
great
while
back
getting
her
letters
through
to
her
and
such
like
but
last
year
when
that
damned
sir
amyas
paulet
became
her
gaoler
i
could
do
nothing
two
or
three
times
my
messenger
was
stopped
and
the
letters
taken
from
him
well
after
that
time
i
could
do
no
more
there
her
grace
was
back
again
at
tutbury
and
none
could
get
near
her
she
might
no
more
give
alms
even
to
the
poor
and
all
her
letters
must
go
through
walsingham
hands
and
then
god
helped
us
she
was
taken
last
autumn
to
chartley
near
by
which
is
the
house
of
the
giffords
and
since
that
time
we
have
been
almost
merry
do
you
know
gilbert
gifford
he
hath
been
with
the
jesuits
hath
he
not
that
is
the
man
well
gilbert
gifford
hath
been
god
angel
to
us
a
quiet
still
kind
of
a
man
you
have
seen
him
i
have
spoken
with
him
at
rheims
said
robin
i
know
nothing
of
him
well
he
contrived
the
plan
he
hath
devised
a
that
hath
the
beer
all
roundabout
so
that
when
they
push
their
rods
in
there
seems
all
beer
within
but
in
the
heart
of
the
beer
there
is
secured
a
little
iron
case
and
within
the
iron
case
there
is
space
for
papers
well
this
barrel
goes
to
and
fro
to
chartley
and
to
a
brewer
that
is
a
good
catholic
and
within
the
case
there
are
the
letters
and
in
this
way
all
has
been
prepared
robin
looked
up
again
he
remained
quiet
through
all
the
story
and
lifted
no
more
than
his
eyes
his
fingers
played
continually
with
a
button
on
his
doublet
you
mean
that
queen
mary
hath
consented
to
this
why
yes
to
her
sister
death
why
yes
i
do
not
believe
it
said
the
priest
quietly
on
whose
word
does
that
stand
why
on
her
own
whose
else
snapped
anthony
you
mean
you
have
it
in
her
own
hand
signed
by
her
name
it
is
in
gifford
hand
is
not
that
enough
and
there
is
her
seal
to
it
it
is
in
cypher
of
course
what
would
you
have
where
is
she
now
asked
robin
paying
no
attention
to
the
question
she
hath
just
now
been
moved
again
to
tixall
for
what
i
do
not
know
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
matter
she
will
be
back
soon
again
i
tell
you
all
is
arranged
tell
me
the
rest
of
the
story
said
the
priest
there
is
not
much
more
so
it
stands
at
present
i
tell
you
her
grace
hath
been
tossed
to
and
fro
like
a
ball
at
play
she
was
at
chatsworth
as
you
know
she
has
been
shut
up
in
chartley
like
a
criminal
she
was
at
babington
house
even
god
if
i
had
but
known
it
in
time
in
babington
house
why
when
was
that
last
year
early
with
sir
ralph
sadler
who
was
her
gaoler
then
cried
anthony
bitterly
but
for
a
night
only
i
have
sold
the
house
sold
it
i
do
not
keep
prisons
snapped
anthony
i
will
have
none
of
it
well
well
resumed
the
other
man
quietly
i
must
say
that
when
ballard
was
taken
when
was
that
last
week
only
well
when
he
was
taken
i
thought
perhaps
all
was
known
but
i
find
walsingham
conversation
very
comforting
though
little
he
knows
it
poor
man
he
knows
that
i
am
a
catholic
and
he
was
lamenting
to
me
only
three
days
ago
of
the
zeal
of
these
informers
he
said
he
could
not
save
ballard
so
hot
was
the
pursuit
after
him
that
he
would
lose
favour
with
her
grace
if
he
did
what
comfort
is
there
in
that
why
it
shows
plain
enough
that
nothing
is
known
of
the
true
facts
if
they
were
after
him
for
this
design
of
ours
do
you
think
that
walsingham
would
speak
like
that
he
would
clap
us
all
in
ward
long
ago
the
young
priest
was
silent
his
head
still
whirled
with
the
tale
and
his
heart
was
sick
at
the
misery
of
it
all
this
was
scarcely
the
he
had
looked
for
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
other
anthony
lad
he
said
i
beseech
you
to
give
it
up
anthony
smiled
at
him
frankly
his
excitement
was
sunk
down
again
you
were
always
a
little
soft
he
said
i
remember
you
would
have
nought
to
do
with
us
before
why
we
are
at
war
i
tell
you
and
it
is
not
we
who
declared
it
they
have
made
war
on
us
now
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
more
what
of
all
the
catholics
priests
and
others
who
have
died
on
the
gibbet
or
rotted
in
prison
if
her
grace
makes
war
upon
us
why
should
we
not
make
war
upon
her
grace
tell
me
that
then
anthony
i
beseech
you
to
give
it
up
i
hate
the
whole
matter
and
fear
it
too
fear
it
why
i
tell
you
we
hold
them
he
stretched
out
his
lean
young
hand
and
clenched
the
long
fingers
slowly
together
we
have
them
by
the
throat
you
will
be
glad
enough
to
profit
by
it
when
mary
reigns
what
is
there
to
fear
i
do
not
know
i
am
uneasy
but
that
is
not
to
the
purpose
i
tell
you
it
is
forbidden
by
god
uneasy
fear
it
why
tell
me
what
there
is
to
fear
what
hole
can
you
find
anywhere
i
do
not
know
i
hardly
know
the
tale
yet
but
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
a
hundred
tell
me
one
of
them
then
anthony
threw
himself
back
with
an
indulgent
smile
on
his
face
why
if
you
will
have
it
said
robin
roused
by
the
contempt
there
is
one
great
hole
in
this
all
hangs
upon
gifford
word
as
it
seems
to
me
you
have
not
spoken
with
mary
you
have
not
even
her
own
hand
on
it
bah
why
her
grace
of
the
scots
can
not
write
in
cypher
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
it
may
be
so
but
i
say
that
all
hangs
upon
gifford
and
you
think
gifford
can
be
a
liar
and
a
knave
sneered
anthony
i
have
not
one
word
against
him
said
the
priest
but
neither
had
i
against
thomas
fitzherbert
and
you
know
what
has
befallen
anthony
snorted
with
disdain
put
your
finger
through
another
hole
he
said
well
i
like
not
the
comfort
that
secretary
walsingham
has
given
you
you
told
me
a
while
ago
that
ballard
was
on
the
eve
of
going
to
france
now
walsingham
is
no
fool
i
would
to
god
he
were
he
has
laid
enough
of
our
men
by
the
heels
already
by
god
cried
anthony
roused
again
i
would
not
willingly
call
you
a
fool
either
my
man
but
do
you
not
understand
that
walsingham
believes
me
as
loyal
as
himself
here
have
i
been
at
court
for
the
last
year
bowing
before
her
grace
and
never
a
word
said
to
me
on
my
religion
and
here
is
walsingham
has
bidden
me
to
lodge
in
his
house
in
the
midst
of
all
his
spider
webs
do
you
think
he
would
do
that
if
i
think
he
might
have
done
so
said
robin
slowly
anthony
sprang
to
his
feet
my
robin
he
said
you
were
right
enough
when
you
said
you
would
not
join
with
us
you
were
not
made
for
this
work
you
would
see
an
enemy
in
your
own
father
he
stopped
confounded
robin
smiled
drearily
i
have
seen
one
in
him
he
said
anthony
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
not
unkindly
forgive
me
my
robin
i
did
not
think
what
i
said
well
we
will
leave
it
at
that
and
you
would
not
give
me
absolution
the
priest
shook
his
head
then
give
me
your
blessing
said
anthony
dropping
on
his
knees
and
so
we
will
close
up
the
iii
it
was
a
priest
that
presently
downstairs
stood
with
anthony
in
one
of
the
and
was
made
known
to
half
a
dozen
strangers
every
word
that
he
had
heard
upstairs
must
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
spoken
from
the
instant
at
which
anthony
had
first
sat
down
to
the
instant
in
which
he
had
kneeled
down
to
receive
his
blessing
so
much
he
knew
from
his
studies
at
rheims
he
must
be
to
each
man
that
he
met
that
which
he
would
have
been
to
him
an
hour
ago
yet
though
as
a
man
he
must
know
nothing
his
priest
heart
was
heavy
in
his
breast
it
was
a
strange
to
pass
from
the
ordered
piety
of
the
college
to
the
whirl
of
politics
and
plots
in
which
good
and
evil
span
round
together
honest
and
fiery
zeal
for
god
cause
mingled
with
what
he
was
persuaded
was
crime
and
abomination
he
had
thought
that
a
priest
life
would
be
a
simple
thing
but
it
seemed
otherwise
now
he
spoke
with
those
men
those
who
knew
him
well
enough
for
a
priest
and
presently
when
some
of
his
own
party
came
drew
aside
again
with
anthony
who
began
to
tell
him
in
a
low
voice
of
the
personages
there
these
are
all
my
private
friends
he
said
and
some
of
them
be
men
of
substance
in
their
own
place
there
is
charnoc
of
lancashire
he
with
the
gilt
sword
he
is
of
the
court
of
her
grace
and
comes
and
goes
as
he
pleases
he
is
lodged
in
whitehall
and
comes
here
but
to
see
his
friends
and
there
is
savage
in
the
new
clothes
with
his
beard
cut
short
he
is
a
very
honest
fellow
but
of
a
small
substance
though
of
good
family
enough
her
grace
has
some
of
her
ladies
too
that
are
catholics
has
she
not
asked
robin
there
are
two
or
three
at
least
and
no
trouble
made
they
hear
mass
when
they
can
at
the
embassies
mendoza
is
a
very
good
friend
of
ours
charnoc
came
up
presently
to
the
two
he
was
a
man
of
northern
descent
very
particular
in
his
clothes
with
large
gold
he
wore
a
short
pointed
beard
above
his
stiff
ruff
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
fanatical
you
are
from
rheims
i
understand
mr
alban
he
sat
down
with
something
of
an
air
next
to
robin
and
your
county
he
asked
i
am
from
derbyshire
sir
said
robin
from
derbyshire
then
you
will
have
heard
of
mistress
marjorie
manners
no
doubt
she
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
said
robin
smiling
the
man
had
a
great
personal
charm
about
him
you
are
very
happy
in
your
friends
then
said
the
other
i
have
never
spoken
with
her
myself
but
i
hear
of
her
continually
as
assisting
our
people
sending
them
now
up
into
the
peak
country
now
into
the
towns
as
the
case
may
be
and
never
a
mistake
it
was
delightful
to
robin
to
hear
her
praised
and
he
talked
of
her
keenly
and
volubly
exactly
that
had
happened
which
five
years
ago
he
would
have
thought
impossible
for
every
trace
of
his
old
feeling
towards
her
was
gone
leaving
behind
and
that
only
in
the
very
deepest
intimacies
of
his
thought
a
sweet
and
pleasant
romance
like
the
glow
in
the
sky
when
the
sun
is
gone
down
little
by
little
that
had
come
about
which
in
marjorie
had
transformed
her
when
she
first
sent
him
to
rheims
it
was
not
that
reaction
had
followed
there
was
no
contempt
either
of
her
or
of
himself
for
what
he
had
once
thought
of
her
but
another
great
passion
had
risen
above
it
a
passion
of
which
the
human
lover
can
not
even
guess
kindled
for
one
that
is
greater
than
man
a
passion
fed
trained
and
pruned
by
those
six
years
of
studious
peace
at
rheims
directed
by
experts
in
humanity
there
he
had
seen
what
love
could
do
when
it
could
rise
higher
than
its
human
channels
he
had
seen
young
men
scarcely
older
than
himself
set
out
for
england
as
for
their
bridals
exultant
and
on
fire
and
back
to
rheims
had
come
again
the
news
of
their
martyrdom
this
one
died
crying
to
jesu
as
a
child
cries
to
his
mother
at
the
this
one
had
said
nothing
upon
the
scaffold
but
his
face
they
said
who
brought
the
news
had
been
as
the
face
of
stephen
at
his
stoning
and
others
had
come
back
themselves
banished
with
pain
of
death
on
their
returning
yet
back
once
more
these
had
gone
and
last
more
than
once
there
had
crept
back
to
rheims
borne
on
a
litter
all
the
way
from
the
coast
the
phantom
of
a
man
who
a
year
or
two
ago
had
played
cat
and
shouted
at
the
play
now
a
bent
man
with
great
scars
on
wrists
and
ankles
had
been
sung
in
the
college
chapel
when
the
news
of
the
deaths
had
come
there
were
no
for
such
as
these
and
the
place
of
the
martyr
in
the
refectory
was
decked
with
flowers
robin
had
seen
these
things
and
wondered
whether
his
place
too
would
some
day
be
so
decked
for
marjorie
then
he
felt
nothing
but
a
happy
friendliness
and
a
real
delight
when
he
thought
of
seeing
her
again
it
was
glorious
he
thought
that
she
had
done
so
much
that
her
name
was
in
all
mouths
and
he
had
thought
when
he
had
first
gone
to
rheims
that
he
would
do
all
and
she
nothing
he
had
written
to
her
then
freely
and
happily
he
had
told
her
that
she
must
give
him
shelter
some
day
as
she
was
doing
for
so
many
meanwhile
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
her
praises
would
be
eve
quoted
charnoc
presently
in
speaking
of
pious
women
obstinacy
adam
would
say
nay
then
at
last
when
charnoc
said
that
he
must
be
leaving
for
his
own
lodgings
and
stood
up
once
more
upon
robin
heart
there
fell
the
horrible
memory
of
all
that
he
had
heard
upstairs
chapter
ii
i
it
was
strange
to
robin
to
walk
about
the
city
and
to
view
all
that
he
saw
from
his
new
interior
position
the
last
time
that
he
had
been
in
his
own
country
on
that
short
visit
with
captain
fortescue
he
had
been
innocent
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
or
at
least
no
more
guilty
than
any
one
of
the
hundreds
of
young
men
who
in
spite
of
the
regulations
were
sent
abroad
to
finish
their
education
amid
catholic
surroundings
now
however
his
very
presence
was
an
offence
he
had
broken
every
law
framed
expressly
against
such
cases
as
his
he
had
studied
abroad
he
had
been
ordained
beyond
the
seas
he
had
read
his
mass
in
his
own
bedchamber
he
had
practically
received
a
confession
and
it
was
his
fixed
and
firm
intention
to
reconcile
as
many
of
her
subjects
as
possible
to
the
roman
see
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
found
pleasure
in
the
sheer
adventure
of
it
as
would
every
young
man
of
spirit
and
he
wore
his
fine
clothes
clinked
his
sword
and
cocked
his
secular
hat
with
delight
the
burden
of
what
he
had
heard
still
was
heavy
on
him
it
was
true
that
in
a
manner
inconceivable
to
any
but
a
priest
it
lay
apart
altogether
from
his
common
consciousness
he
had
talked
freely
enough
to
charnoc
and
the
rest
he
could
not
even
by
a
momentary
lapse
allow
what
he
knew
to
colour
even
the
thoughts
by
which
he
dealt
with
men
in
ordinary
life
for
though
it
was
true
that
no
confession
had
been
made
yet
it
was
in
virtue
of
his
priesthood
that
he
had
been
told
so
much
yet
there
were
moments
when
he
walked
alone
with
nothing
else
to
distract
him
when
the
cloud
came
down
again
and
there
were
moments
too
in
spite
of
himself
when
his
heart
beat
with
another
emotion
when
he
pictured
what
might
not
be
five
years
hence
if
elizabeth
were
taken
out
of
the
way
and
mary
reigned
in
her
stead
he
knew
from
his
father
how
swiftly
and
enthusiastically
the
old
faith
had
come
back
with
mary
tudor
after
the
winter
of
edward
reign
and
if
as
some
estimated
a
third
of
england
were
still
convincedly
catholic
and
perhaps
not
more
than
one
twentieth
convincedly
protestant
might
not
mary
stuart
with
her
charm
accomplish
more
even
than
mary
tudor
with
her
lack
of
it
he
saw
many
fine
sights
during
the
three
or
four
days
after
his
coming
to
london
for
he
had
to
wait
there
at
least
that
time
until
a
party
that
was
expected
from
the
north
should
arrive
with
news
of
where
he
was
to
go
these
were
the
instructions
he
had
had
from
rheims
so
he
walked
freely
abroad
during
these
days
to
see
the
sights
and
even
ventured
to
pay
a
visit
to
fathers
garnett
and
southwell
two
jesuits
that
arrived
a
month
ago
and
were
for
the
present
lodging
in
my
lord
vaux
house
in
hackney
he
was
astonished
at
father
southwell
youthfulness
this
priest
had
landed
but
a
short
while
before
and
for
the
present
was
remaining
quietly
in
the
edge
of
london
with
the
older
man
for
himself
was
scarcely
years
old
and
looked
twenty
at
the
most
he
was
very
quiet
and
sedate
with
a
face
of
almost
feminine
delicacy
and
passed
a
good
deal
of
his
leisure
as
the
old
lord
told
robin
in
writing
verses
he
appeared
a
strangely
fine
instrument
for
such
heavy
work
as
was
a
priest
on
another
day
robin
saw
the
archbishop
land
at
westminster
stairs
it
was
a
brilliant
day
of
sunshine
as
he
came
up
the
and
a
little
crowd
of
folks
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
drew
his
attention
then
he
heard
out
of
sight
the
throb
of
oars
grow
louder
then
a
cry
of
command
and
as
he
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
looked
over
the
archbishop
with
a
cloak
thrown
over
his
rochet
was
just
stepping
out
of
the
huge
gilded
barge
whose
liveried
oarsmen
steadied
the
vessel
or
stood
at
the
salute
it
was
a
gay
and
dignified
spectacle
as
he
perceived
in
spite
of
his
intense
antipathy
to
the
sight
of
a
man
who
to
him
was
no
better
than
an
usurper
and
a
deceiver
of
the
people
whitgift
too
was
no
friend
to
catholics
he
had
for
instance
deliberately
defended
the
use
of
the
rack
against
them
and
others
unashamed
and
in
one
particular
instance
at
least
as
bishop
of
worcester
had
directed
its
exercise
in
the
county
of
denbigh
these
things
were
perfectly
known
of
course
even
beyond
the
seas
to
the
priests
who
were
to
go
on
the
english
mission
in
surprising
detail
robin
knew
even
that
this
man
was
wholly
ignorant
of
greek
he
looked
at
him
carefully
as
he
came
up
the
stairs
and
was
surprised
at
the
kindly
face
of
him
however
though
with
pleasant
searching
eyes
his
coach
was
waiting
outside
old
palace
yard
and
robin
following
with
the
rest
of
the
little
crowd
saluted
him
respectfully
as
he
climbed
into
it
followed
by
a
couple
of
chaplains
as
he
walked
on
he
glanced
back
across
the
river
at
lambeth
there
it
lay
then
the
home
of
warham
and
pole
and
morton
with
the
water
lapping
its
towers
it
had
once
stood
for
the
spiritual
state
of
god
in
england
facing
its
partner
and
sometimes
its
rival
westminster
and
whitehall
now
it
was
a
department
of
the
civil
state
merely
it
was
occupied
by
men
such
as
grindal
sequestrated
and
deprived
of
even
his
spiritual
functions
by
the
woman
who
now
grasped
all
the
reins
of
the
commonwealth
and
now
again
by
the
man
whom
he
had
just
seen
placed
there
by
the
same
woman
to
carry
out
her
will
more
obediently
against
all
who
denied
her
supremacy
in
matters
spiritual
as
well
as
temporal
whether
papists
or
independents
the
priest
was
astonished
as
he
reached
the
precincts
of
whitehall
to
observe
the
number
of
guards
that
were
everywhere
visible
he
had
been
warned
at
rheims
not
to
bring
himself
into
too
much
notice
no
more
than
markedly
to
avoid
it
so
he
did
not
attempt
to
penetrate
even
the
outer
courts
or
passages
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
an
air
of
watchfulness
was
everywhere
at
the
gate
towards
which
he
looked
at
least
half
a
dozen
men
were
on
formal
guard
their
uniforms
and
weapons
sparkling
brilliantly
in
the
sunshine
and
besides
these
within
the
open
doors
he
caught
sight
of
a
couple
of
officers
as
he
stood
there
a
man
came
out
of
one
of
the
houses
near
the
gate
and
turned
towards
it
he
was
immediately
challenged
and
presently
passed
on
within
where
one
of
the
officers
came
forward
to
speak
to
him
then
robin
thought
he
had
stood
looking
long
enough
and
moved
away
he
came
back
to
the
city
across
the
fields
half
a
mile
away
from
the
river
and
indeed
it
was
a
glorious
sight
he
had
before
him
here
about
him
was
open
ground
on
either
side
of
the
road
on
which
he
walked
and
there
in
front
rose
up
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
the
long
line
of
great
old
houses
beyond
the
stream
that
ran
down
into
the
thames
old
religious
houses
for
the
most
part
now
disguised
and
pulled
about
beyond
recognition
ranging
right
and
left
from
the
ludgate
itself
behind
these
rose
again
towers
and
roofs
and
high
above
all
the
tall
spire
of
the
cathedral
as
if
to
gather
all
into
one
culminant
aspiration
the
light
from
the
west
lay
on
every
surface
that
looked
to
his
left
golden
and
rosy
elsewhere
lay
blue
and
dusky
shadows
ii
there
is
a
letter
for
you
sir
said
the
landlord
who
had
an
uneasy
look
on
his
face
as
the
priest
came
through
the
entrance
of
the
inn
robin
took
it
its
superscription
ran
shortly
to
alban
at
the
red
bull
inn
in
cheapside
haste
haste
haste
he
turned
it
over
it
was
sealed
plainly
on
the
back
without
arms
or
any
device
it
was
a
thick
package
and
appeared
as
if
it
might
hold
an
enclosure
or
two
robin
had
learned
caution
in
a
good
school
and
what
is
yet
more
vital
in
true
caution
an
appearance
of
carelessness
he
weighed
the
packet
easily
in
his
hand
as
if
it
were
of
no
value
though
he
knew
it
might
contain
very
questionable
stuff
from
one
of
his
friends
and
glanced
at
a
quantity
of
baggage
that
lay
heaped
beside
the
wall
what
is
all
this
he
said
another
party
arrived
no
sir
the
party
is
leaving
rather
it
is
left
already
and
the
gentlemen
bade
me
have
the
baggage
ready
here
they
would
send
for
it
later
they
told
me
this
was
unusually
voluble
from
this
man
robin
looked
at
him
quickly
and
away
again
what
party
he
said
the
gentlemen
you
were
with
this
two
nights
past
sir
said
the
landlord
keenly
robin
was
aware
of
a
feeling
as
if
a
finger
had
been
laid
on
his
heart
but
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moved
indeed
he
said
they
told
me
nothing
of
it
then
he
moved
on
easily
feeling
the
landlord
eyes
in
every
inch
of
his
back
and
went
leisurely
upstairs
he
reached
his
room
bolted
the
door
softly
behind
him
and
sat
down
his
heart
was
going
now
like
a
hammer
then
he
opened
the
packet
an
enclosure
fell
out
of
it
also
sealed
but
without
direction
of
any
kind
then
he
saw
that
the
sheet
in
which
the
packet
had
come
was
itself
covered
with
writing
rather
large
and
sprawling
as
if
written
in
haste
he
put
the
packet
aside
and
then
lifted
the
paper
to
read
it
when
he
had
finished
he
sat
quite
still
the
room
looked
to
him
misty
and
unreal
the
paper
crackled
in
his
shaking
fingers
and
a
drop
of
sweat
ran
suddenly
into
the
corner
of
his
dry
lips
then
he
read
the
paper
again
it
ran
as
follows
it
is
all
found
out
we
think
i
find
myself
watched
at
every
point
and
i
can
get
no
speech
with
i
can
not
go
forth
from
the
house
without
a
fellow
to
follow
me
and
two
of
my
friends
have
found
the
same
too
hath
been
with
this
three
hours
back
by
chance
i
saw
him
come
in
and
he
has
not
yet
left
again
ch
is
watching
for
me
while
i
write
this
and
will
see
that
this
letter
is
bestowed
on
a
trusty
man
who
will
bring
it
to
your
inn
and
with
it
another
letter
to
bid
our
party
save
themselves
while
they
can
i
do
not
know
how
we
shall
fare
but
we
shall
meet
at
a
point
that
is
fixed
and
after
that
evade
or
die
together
you
were
right
you
see
has
acted
the
traitor
throughout
with
connivance
and
assistance
i
beg
of
you
then
to
carry
this
letter
which
i
send
in
this
to
her
for
whom
we
have
forfeited
our
lives
or
at
least
our
country
or
if
you
can
not
take
it
with
safety
master
the
contents
of
it
by
rote
and
deliver
it
to
her
with
your
own
mouth
she
has
been
taken
back
to
again
whither
you
must
go
and
all
her
effects
searched
there
was
no
signature
but
there
followed
a
dash
of
the
pen
and
then
a
scrawled
as
if
an
interruption
had
come
or
as
if
the
man
who
was
with
the
writer
would
wait
no
longer
a
third
time
robin
read
it
through
it
was
terribly
easy
of
interpretation
b
was
ballard
was
gifford
was
walsingham
ch
was
charnoc
her
was
mary
stuart
was
chartley
it
fitted
and
made
sense
like
a
child
puzzle
and
if
the
faintest
doubt
could
remain
in
the
most
incredulous
mind
as
to
the
horrible
reality
of
it
all
there
was
the
piled
luggage
downstairs
that
would
never
be
sent
for
and
never
indeed
needed
again
by
its
owners
in
this
world
then
he
took
up
the
second
sealed
packet
and
held
it
unbroken
while
his
mind
flew
like
a
bird
and
in
less
than
a
minute
he
decided
and
opened
it
it
was
a
piteous
letter
signed
again
merely
and
might
have
been
written
by
any
reverent
lover
to
his
beloved
it
spoke
an
eternal
the
writer
said
that
he
would
lay
down
his
life
gladly
again
in
such
a
cause
if
it
were
called
for
and
would
lay
down
a
thousand
if
he
had
them
he
entreated
her
to
look
to
herself
for
that
no
doubt
every
attempt
would
now
be
made
to
entrap
her
and
it
warned
her
to
put
no
longer
any
confidence
in
a
detestable
knave
finally
he
begged
that
jesu
would
have
her
in
his
holy
keeping
and
that
if
matters
fell
out
as
he
thought
they
would
she
would
pray
for
his
soul
and
the
souls
of
all
that
had
been
with
him
in
the
enterprise
he
read
it
through
three
or
four
times
every
line
and
letter
burned
itself
into
his
brain
then
he
tore
it
across
and
across
then
he
tore
the
letter
addressed
to
himself
in
the
same
manner
then
he
went
through
all
the
fragments
piece
by
piece
tearing
each
into
smaller
fragments
till
there
remained
in
his
hands
just
a
bunch
of
tiny
scraps
smaller
than
snowflakes
and
these
he
scattered
out
of
the
window
then
he
went
to
his
door
unbolted
it
and
walked
downstairs
to
find
the
landlord
iii
it
was
not
until
ten
days
later
soon
after
dawn
that
robin
set
out
on
his
melancholy
errand
he
rode
out
northward
as
soon
as
the
gates
were
opened
with
young
arnold
a
priest
ordained
with
him
in
rheims
and
one
of
his
party
disguised
as
a
servant
following
him
on
a
with
the
luggage
it
was
a
misty
morning
white
and
cheerless
with
the
early
fog
that
had
drifted
up
from
the
river
last
night
the
news
had
come
in
that
anthony
and
at
least
one
other
had
been
taken
near
harrow
in
disguise
and
the
streets
had
been
full
of
riotous
rejoicing
over
the
capture
he
had
thought
it
more
prudent
to
wait
till
after
receiving
the
news
which
he
so
much
dreaded
lest
haste
should
bring
suspicion
on
himself
and
the
message
that
he
carried
since
for
him
too
to
disappear
at
once
would
have
meant
an
almost
inevitable
association
of
him
with
the
party
of
plotters
but
it
had
been
a
hard
time
to
pass
through
early
in
the
morning
after
anthony
flight
he
had
awakened
to
hear
a
rapping
upon
the
inn
door
and
peeping
from
his
window
had
seen
a
couple
of
plainly
dressed
men
waiting
for
admittance
but
after
that
he
had
seen
no
more
of
them
he
had
deliberately
refrained
from
speaking
with
the
landlord
except
to
remark
again
upon
the
luggage
of
which
he
caught
a
sight
piled
no
longer
in
the
entrance
but
in
the
little
room
that
the
man
himself
used
the
landlord
had
said
shortly
that
it
had
not
yet
been
sent
for
and
the
greater
part
of
the
day
after
he
had
told
the
companions
that
had
come
with
him
from
rheims
that
he
had
had
a
letter
which
seemed
to
show
that
the
party
with
whom
they
had
made
friends
had
disappeared
and
were
probably
under
suspicion
and
had
made
the
necessary
arrangements
for
his
own
departure
with
young
arnold
he
spent
in
walking
abroad
as
usual
the
days
that
followed
had
been
bitter
and
heavy
he
had
liked
neither
to
stop
within
doors
nor
to
go
abroad
since
the
one
course
might
arouse
inquiry
and
the
second
lead
to
his
identification
he
had
gone
to
my
lord
vaux
house
again
and
again
with
his
friend
and
without
him
he
had
learned
of
the
details
of
anthony
capture
though
he
had
not
dared
even
to
attempt
to
get
speech
with
him
and
further
that
unless
the
rest
of
the
men
were
caught
it
would
not
be
easy
to
prove
anything
against
him
one
thing
therefore
he
prayed
for
with
all
his
heart
that
the
rest
might
yet
escape
he
told
his
party
something
of
the
course
of
events
but
not
too
much
on
the
sunday
that
intervened
he
went
to
hear
mass
in
fetter
lane
where
numbers
of
catholics
resorted
and
there
piece
by
piece
learned
more
of
the
plot
than
even
anthony
had
told
him
arnold
was
a
lancashire
man
and
a
young
convert
of
oxford
one
of
that
steady
small
stream
that
poured
over
to
the
continent
a
sufficiently
and
intelligent
man
to
enjoy
acting
as
a
servant
which
he
did
with
considerable
skill
it
was
common
enough
for
gentlemen
to
ride
side
by
side
with
their
servants
when
they
had
left
the
town
and
by
the
time
that
the
two
were
clear
of
the
few
scattered
houses
outside
the
city
gates
arnold
urged
on
his
horse
and
they
rode
together
robin
was
in
somewhat
of
a
difficulty
as
to
how
far
he
was
justified
in
speaking
of
what
he
knew
it
was
true
that
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
use
what
anthony
had
originally
told
him
but
the
letter
and
the
commission
which
he
had
received
certainly
liberated
his
conscience
to
some
degree
since
it
told
him
plainly
enough
that
there
was
a
plot
on
behalf
of
mary
that
certain
persons
one
or
two
of
whom
he
knew
for
himself
were
involved
in
it
that
they
were
under
suspicion
and
that
they
had
fled
ordinary
discretion
however
was
enough
to
make
him
hold
his
tongue
beyond
saying
as
he
had
said
already
to
the
rest
of
them
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
babington
now
in
prison
to
mary
stuart
arnold
had
been
advertised
that
he
might
take
up
his
duties
in
lancashire
as
soon
as
he
liked
but
because
of
his
inexperience
and
youth
it
had
been
decided
that
he
had
better
ride
with
alban
so
far
as
chartley
at
least
and
thence
if
all
were
well
go
on
to
lancaster
itself
where
his
family
was
known
and
whither
he
could
return
for
the
present
without
suspicion
the
roads
such
as
they
were
were
in
a
terrible
state
still
with
the
heavy
rain
of
a
few
days
ago
and
the
further
showers
that
had
fallen
in
the
night
they
made
very
poor
progress
and
by
were
not
yet
in
sight
of
watford
but
they
pushed
on
coming
at
last
about
one
to
that
little
town
all
gathered
together
in
the
trench
of
the
low
hills
there
was
a
modest
inn
in
the
main
street
with
a
little
garden
behind
it
and
while
arnold
took
the
horses
off
for
watering
robin
went
through
to
the
garden
sat
down
and
ordered
food
to
be
served
for
himself
and
his
man
together
the
day
was
warmer
and
the
sun
came
out
as
they
sat
over
their
meal
when
they
had
done
robin
sent
his
friend
off
again
for
the
horses
they
must
not
delay
longer
than
was
necessary
if
they
wished
to
sleep
at
leighton
and
give
the
horses
their
proper
rest
when
he
was
left
alone
he
fell
once
more
and
what
with
the
morning
ride
and
the
air
and
the
sunshine
and
the
sense
of
liberty
he
was
inclined
to
be
more
cheerful
surely
england
was
large
enough
to
hide
the
rest
of
the
plotters
for
a
time
until
they
could
get
out
of
it
anthony
was
taken
indeed
yet
without
the
rest
he
might
very
well
escape
conviction
robin
had
not
been
challenged
in
any
way
the
gatekeepers
had
looked
at
him
indeed
as
he
came
out
of
the
city
but
so
they
always
did
and
the
landlady
here
had
run
her
eyes
over
him
but
that
was
the
way
of
landladies
who
wished
to
know
how
much
should
be
charged
to
travellers
and
if
he
had
come
out
so
easily
why
should
not
his
friends
all
turned
now
to
his
mind
on
whether
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
could
evade
the
pursuivants
or
not
he
stood
up
presently
to
stretch
his
legs
before
mounting
again
and
as
he
stood
up
he
heard
running
footsteps
somewhere
beyond
the
house
they
died
away
but
then
came
the
sound
of
another
runner
and
of
another
and
he
heard
voices
calling
then
a
window
was
flung
up
beyond
the
house
steps
came
rattling
down
the
stairs
within
and
passed
out
into
the
street
it
was
probably
a
bull
that
had
escaped
or
a
mad
dog
he
thought
or
some
rustic
excitement
of
that
kind
and
he
thought
he
would
go
and
see
it
for
himself
so
he
passed
out
through
the
house
just
in
time
to
meet
arnold
coming
round
with
the
horses
what
was
the
noise
about
he
asked
the
other
looked
at
him
i
heard
none
sir
he
said
i
was
in
the
stable
robin
looked
up
and
down
the
street
it
seemed
as
empty
as
it
should
be
on
a
summer
day
two
or
three
women
were
at
the
doors
of
their
houses
and
an
old
dog
was
asleep
in
the
sun
there
was
no
sign
of
any
disturbance
where
is
the
woman
of
the
house
asked
robin
i
do
not
know
sir
they
could
not
go
without
paying
but
robin
marvelled
at
the
simplicity
of
these
folks
to
leave
a
couple
of
guests
free
to
ride
away
he
went
within
again
and
called
out
but
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
this
is
laughable
he
said
coming
out
again
shall
we
leave
a
mark
behind
us
and
be
off
are
they
all
gone
sir
asked
the
other
staring
at
him
i
heard
some
running
and
calling
out
just
now
said
robin
i
suppose
a
message
must
have
been
brought
to
the
house
then
as
he
stood
still
hesitating
a
noise
of
voices
arose
suddenly
round
the
corner
of
the
street
and
a
group
of
men
with
pitchforks
ran
out
from
a
gateway
on
the
other
side
fifty
yards
away
crossed
the
road
and
disappeared
again
behind
them
ran
a
woman
or
two
a
barking
dog
and
a
string
of
children
but
robin
thought
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
kind
of
officer
uniform
at
the
head
of
the
running
men
and
his
heart
stood
still
iv
neither
of
the
two
spoke
for
a
moment
wait
here
with
the
horses
said
robin
i
must
see
what
all
this
is
about
arnold
was
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
still
and
he
had
all
the
desire
of
a
boy
if
he
saw
an
excited
crowd
to
join
himself
to
it
but
he
was
being
a
servant
just
now
and
must
do
what
he
was
told
so
he
waited
patiently
with
the
two
horses
that
tossed
their
jingling
heads
and
stamped
and
attempted
to
kick
flies
off
impossibly
remote
parts
of
their
bodies
certainly
the
excitement
was
growing
after
he
had
seen
his
friend
walk
quickly
down
the
road
and
turn
off
where
the
group
of
men
had
disappeared
in
the
direction
where
haystacks
shaded
their
gables
beyond
the
roofs
of
the
houses
several
other
figures
appeared
through
the
opposite
gateway
in
hot
pursuit
one
was
certainly
a
guard
of
some
kind
a
stout
fellow
who
ran
and
wheezed
as
he
ran
loud
enough
to
be
heard
at
the
inn
door
the
women
standing
before
the
houses
too
presently
were
after
the
rest
all
except
one
old
dame
who
put
her
head
forth
and
peered
this
way
and
that
with
a
vindictive
anger
at
having
been
left
all
alone
more
yet
showed
themselves
children
dragging
puppies
after
them
an
old
man
with
a
large
rusty
sword
a
couple
of
lads
each
with
a
pike
these
appeared
like
figures
in
a
pantomime
play
whisking
into
sight
from
between
the
houses
and
all
disappearing
again
immediately
and
then
all
on
a
sudden
a
great
clamour
of
voices
began
all
shouting
together
as
if
some
quarry
had
been
sighted
it
grew
louder
sharp
cries
of
command
rang
above
the
roar
then
there
burst
out
of
the
side
where
all
had
gone
in
a
ball
of
children
which
exploded
into
fragments
and
faced
about
still
with
a
couple
of
puppies
that
barked
shrilly
and
then
walking
very
fast
and
upright
came
robin
audrey
and
stern
straight
up
to
where
the
lad
waited
with
the
horses
robin
jerked
his
head
quick
he
said
we
must
be
off
or
we
shall
be
here
all
night
he
gathered
up
his
reins
for
mounting
what
is
it
sir
asked
the
other
unable
to
be
silent
they
have
caught
some
fellows
he
said
and
the
sir
robin
pulled
out
a
couple
of
coins
from
his
pouch
put
that
on
the
table
within
he
said
we
can
wait
no
longer
give
me
your
reins
his
manner
was
so
dreadful
that
the
young
man
dared
ask
no
more
he
ran
in
laid
the
coins
down
they
were
more
than
double
what
could
have
been
asked
for
their
entertainment
came
out
again
and
mounted
his
own
horse
that
his
friend
held
as
they
rode
down
the
street
he
could
not
refrain
from
looking
back
as
a
great
roar
of
voices
broke
out
again
but
he
could
see
no
more
than
a
crowd
of
men
with
the
pitchforks
moving
like
spears
on
the
outskirt
as
if
they
guarded
prisoners
within
come
out
between
the
houses
and
turn
up
towards
the
inn
they
themselves
had
just
left
as
they
came
clear
of
the
village
and
out
again
upon
the
open
road
robin
turned
to
him
and
his
face
was
still
pale
and
stern
arnold
he
said
those
were
the
last
of
my
friends
that
i
told
you
of
now
they
have
them
all
and
there
is
no
longer
any
hope
they
found
them
behind
the
haystacks
next
to
the
garden
where
we
dined
they
must
have
been
there
all
night
chapter
iii
i
it
was
in
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
after
their
start
that
riding
up
alongside
of
the
blythe
they
struck
out
to
the
northwest
away
from
the
trees
and
saw
the
woods
of
chartley
not
half
a
mile
away
robin
sighed
with
relief
though
as
a
fact
his
adventure
was
scarcely
more
than
begun
since
he
had
yet
to
learn
how
he
could
get
speech
with
the
queen
but
at
least
he
was
within
sight
of
her
and
of
his
own
country
as
well
far
away
eastwards
beyond
the
hills
not
twenty
miles
off
lay
derby
it
had
been
a
melancholy
ride
in
spite
of
the
air
of
freedom
through
which
they
rode
since
news
had
come
to
them
in
more
than
one
place
of
the
fortunes
of
the
babington
party
a
courier
riding
fast
had
passed
them
as
they
sighted
buckingham
and
by
the
time
they
came
in
he
was
gone
again
on
government
business
it
was
said
and
the
little
town
hummed
with
rumours
out
of
which
emerged
at
any
rate
the
certainty
that
the
whole
company
had
been
captured
at
coventry
again
the
tidings
had
travelled
faster
than
themselves
for
here
it
was
reported
that
babington
and
charnoc
had
been
racked
and
in
lichfield
last
of
all
the
tale
was
complete
and
as
they
learned
later
tolerably
accurate
too
it
was
from
a
clerk
in
the
inn
there
that
the
story
came
who
declared
that
there
was
no
secrecy
about
the
matter
any
longer
and
that
he
himself
had
seen
the
tale
in
writing
it
ran
as
follows
the
entire
plot
had
been
known
from
the
beginning
gilbert
gifford
had
been
an
emissary
of
walsingham
throughout
and
every
letter
that
passed
to
and
from
the
various
personages
had
passed
through
the
secretary
hands
and
been
deciphered
in
his
house
there
never
had
been
one
instant
in
which
walsingham
had
been
at
fault
or
in
the
dark
he
had
gone
so
far
it
was
reported
as
to
insert
in
one
of
the
letters
that
was
to
go
to
babington
a
request
for
the
names
of
all
the
conspirators
and
in
return
there
had
come
from
him
not
only
a
list
of
the
names
but
a
pictured
group
of
them
with
babington
himself
in
the
midst
this
picture
had
actually
been
shown
to
her
grace
in
order
that
she
might
guard
herself
against
private
assassination
since
two
or
three
of
the
group
were
in
her
own
household
it
is
like
to
go
hard
with
the
scots
queen
said
the
clerk
bitterly
she
has
gone
too
far
this
time
robin
said
nothing
to
commit
himself
for
he
did
not
know
on
which
side
the
man
ranged
himself
but
he
drew
him
aside
after
dinner
and
asked
whether
it
might
be
possible
to
get
a
sight
of
the
queen
i
am
riding
to
derby
he
said
with
my
man
but
if
to
turn
aside
at
chartley
would
give
us
a
chance
of
seeing
her
i
would
do
so
a
queen
in
captivity
is
worth
seeing
and
i
can
see
you
are
a
man
of
influence
the
clerk
looked
at
him
shrewdly
he
was
a
man
plainly
in
love
with
his
own
importance
and
the
priest
last
words
were
balm
to
him
it
might
be
done
he
said
i
do
not
know
robin
saw
the
impression
he
had
made
and
that
the
butter
could
not
be
too
thick
i
am
sure
you
could
do
it
for
me
he
said
if
any
man
could
but
i
understand
that
a
man
of
your
position
may
be
unwilling
the
clerk
solemnly
laid
a
hand
on
the
priest
arm
well
i
will
tell
you
this
he
said
get
speech
with
bourgoign
her
apothecary
he
alone
has
access
to
her
now
besides
her
own
women
it
might
be
he
could
put
you
in
some
private
place
to
see
her
go
by
this
was
not
much
use
thought
robin
but
at
least
it
gave
him
something
to
begin
at
so
he
thanked
the
clerk
solemnly
and
reverentially
and
was
rewarded
by
another
discreet
pat
on
the
arm
the
sight
of
the
chartley
woods
tall
and
splendid
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
and
already
tinged
here
and
there
with
the
first
marks
of
autumn
brought
his
indecision
to
a
point
and
he
realized
that
he
had
no
plan
he
had
heard
that
mary
occasionally
rode
abroad
and
he
hoped
perhaps
to
get
speech
with
her
that
way
but
what
he
had
heard
from
the
clerk
and
others
showed
him
that
this
small
degree
of
liberty
was
now
denied
to
the
queen
in
some
way
or
another
he
must
get
news
of
bourgoign
beyond
that
he
knew
nothing
the
great
gates
of
chartley
were
closed
as
the
two
came
up
to
them
there
was
a
lodge
beside
them
and
a
sentry
stood
there
a
bell
was
ringing
from
the
great
house
within
the
woods
no
doubt
for
but
there
was
no
other
human
being
besides
the
sentry
to
be
seen
so
robin
did
not
even
check
his
weary
horse
but
turned
only
with
a
deliberately
curious
air
as
he
went
past
and
rode
straight
on
then
as
he
rounded
a
corner
he
saw
smoke
going
up
from
houses
it
seemed
outside
the
park
what
is
that
asked
arnold
suddenly
do
you
hear
a
sound
of
a
galloping
horse
grew
louder
behind
them
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
sound
of
another
the
two
priests
were
still
in
view
of
the
sentry
and
knowing
that
chartley
was
guarded
now
as
if
it
had
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
within
robin
reflected
that
to
show
too
little
interest
might
arouse
as
sharp
suspicion
as
too
much
so
he
wheeled
his
horse
round
and
stopped
to
look
they
heard
the
challenge
of
the
sentry
within
and
then
the
unbarring
of
the
gates
an
instant
later
a
courier
dashed
out
and
wheeled
to
the
right
while
at
the
same
time
the
second
galloper
came
to
view
another
courier
on
a
jaded
horse
and
the
two
passed
the
one
plainly
riding
to
london
the
second
arriving
from
it
the
gates
were
yet
open
but
the
second
was
challenged
once
more
before
he
was
allowed
to
pass
and
his
hoofs
sounded
on
the
road
that
led
to
the
house
then
the
gates
clashed
together
again
robin
turned
his
horse
head
once
more
towards
the
houses
conscious
more
than
ever
how
near
he
was
to
the
nerves
of
england
life
and
what
tragic
ties
they
were
between
the
two
royal
cousins
that
demanded
such
a
furious
and
frequent
exchange
of
messages
we
must
do
our
best
here
he
said
nodding
towards
the
little
hamlet
ii
it
was
plainly
a
little
group
of
houses
that
bordered
the
side
of
the
road
away
from
the
enclosed
park
sprung
up
as
a
kind
of
overflow
lodging
for
the
dependants
necessary
to
such
a
suddenly
increased
household
for
the
houses
were
no
more
than
wooden
dwellings
and
with
the
sap
scarcely
yet
finished
oozing
from
the
ends
of
the
beams
and
the
planks
smoke
was
issuing
in
most
cases
from
rough
holes
cut
in
the
roofs
and
in
the
last
rays
of
sunshine
two
or
three
men
were
sitting
on
stools
set
out
before
the
houses
robin
checked
his
horse
before
a
man
whose
face
seemed
kindly
and
who
saluted
courteously
the
fine
gentleman
who
looked
about
with
such
an
air
my
horse
is
he
said
curtly
is
there
an
inn
here
where
my
man
and
i
can
find
lodging
the
man
shook
his
head
looking
at
the
horse
compassionately
he
had
the
air
of
a
groom
about
him
i
fear
not
sir
not
within
five
miles
at
least
not
with
a
room
to
spare
this
is
chartley
is
it
not
asked
the
priest
noticing
that
the
next
man
too
was
listening
aye
sir
can
you
tell
me
if
my
friend
bourgoign
lodges
in
the
house
or
without
the
gates
bourgoign
sir
a
friend
of
yours
i
hope
so
said
robin
smiling
and
keeping
at
least
within
the
letter
of
truth
the
man
mused
a
moment
it
is
possible
he
might
help
you
sir
he
lodges
in
the
house
but
he
comes
sometimes
to
see
a
woman
that
is
sick
here
robin
demanded
where
she
lived
at
the
last
house
sir
a
little
beyond
the
rest
she
is
one
of
her
grace
they
moved
her
out
here
thinking
it
might
be
the
fever
she
had
this
was
plainly
a
communicative
fellow
but
the
priest
thought
it
wiser
not
to
take
too
much
interest
he
tossed
the
man
a
coin
and
rode
on
the
last
house
was
a
little
better
built
than
the
others
and
stood
further
back
from
the
road
robin
dismounted
here
and
with
a
nod
to
arnold
who
was
keeping
his
countenance
admirably
walked
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
on
it
it
was
opened
instantly
as
if
he
were
expected
but
the
woman
face
fell
when
she
saw
him
is
bourgoign
within
asked
the
priest
the
woman
glanced
over
him
before
answering
and
then
out
to
where
the
horses
waited
no
sir
she
said
at
last
we
were
looking
for
him
just
now
she
broke
off
he
is
coming
now
she
said
robin
turned
and
there
walking
down
the
road
was
an
old
man
leaning
on
a
stick
richly
and
soberly
dressed
in
black
wearing
a
black
beaver
hat
on
his
head
a
followed
him
at
a
little
distance
the
priest
saw
that
here
was
an
opportunity
but
there
was
one
more
point
on
which
he
must
satisfy
himself
first
and
what
seemed
to
him
an
inspiration
came
to
his
mind
he
looks
like
a
minister
he
said
carelessly
a
curious
veiled
look
came
over
the
woman
face
robin
made
a
bold
venture
he
smiled
full
in
her
face
you
need
not
fear
he
said
i
quarrel
with
no
man
religion
and
at
the
look
in
her
face
at
this
he
added
you
are
a
catholic
i
suppose
well
i
am
one
too
and
so
i
suppose
is
mr
bourgoign
the
woman
smiled
tremulously
and
the
fear
left
her
eyes
yes
sir
she
said
all
the
friends
of
her
grace
are
catholics
i
think
he
nodded
to
her
again
genially
then
turning
he
went
to
meet
the
apothecary
who
was
now
not
thirty
yards
away
it
was
a
pathetic
old
figure
that
was
hobbling
towards
him
he
seemed
a
man
of
near
seventy
years
old
with
a
beard
and
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
he
carried
himself
heavily
and
ploddingly
robin
argued
to
himself
that
it
must
be
a
kindly
man
who
would
come
out
at
this
hour
perhaps
the
one
hour
he
had
to
himself
to
visit
a
poor
dependant
yet
all
this
was
sheer
conjecture
and
as
the
old
man
came
near
he
saw
there
was
something
besides
kindliness
in
the
eyes
that
met
his
own
he
saluted
boldly
and
deferentially
bourgoign
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
must
speak
five
minutes
with
you
and
i
ask
you
to
make
as
if
you
were
my
friend
the
old
man
stiffened
like
a
it
was
plain
that
he
was
on
his
guard
i
do
not
know
you
sir
i
entreat
you
to
do
as
i
ask
i
am
a
priest
sir
i
entreat
you
to
take
my
hand
as
if
we
were
friends
a
look
of
surprise
went
over
the
physician
face
you
can
send
me
packing
in
ten
minutes
went
on
robin
rapidly
at
the
same
time
holding
out
his
hand
and
we
will
talk
here
in
the
road
if
you
will
there
was
still
a
moment
hesitation
then
he
took
the
priest
hand
i
am
come
straight
from
london
went
on
robin
still
speaking
clearly
yet
with
his
lips
scarcely
moving
a
fortnight
ago
i
talked
with
mr
babington
the
old
man
drew
his
arm
close
within
his
own
you
have
said
enough
or
too
much
at
present
sir
you
shall
walk
with
me
a
hundred
yards
up
this
road
and
justify
what
you
have
said
we
have
had
a
weary
ride
of
it
bourgoign
i
am
on
the
road
to
derby
went
on
robin
talking
loudly
enough
now
to
be
overheard
as
he
hoped
by
any
listeners
and
my
horse
is
spent
i
will
tell
you
my
business
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
as
soon
as
you
bid
me
fifty
yards
up
the
road
the
old
man
pressed
his
arm
again
you
can
tell
me
now
sir
he
said
but
we
will
walk
if
you
please
while
you
do
so
first
said
robin
after
a
moment
consideration
as
to
his
best
beginning
i
will
tell
you
the
name
i
go
by
it
is
alban
i
am
a
priest
as
i
told
you
just
now
i
came
from
rheims
scarcely
a
fortnight
ago
i
am
from
derbyshire
and
i
will
tell
you
my
proper
name
at
the
end
if
you
wish
it
repeat
the
blessing
of
the
deacon
by
the
priest
at
mass
murmured
bourgoign
to
the
amazement
of
the
other
without
the
change
of
an
inflection
in
his
voice
or
a
movement
of
his
hand
sit
in
corde
tuo
et
in
began
the
priest
that
is
enough
sir
for
the
present
well
next
said
robin
hardly
yet
recovered
from
the
extraordinary
promptness
of
the
challenge
next
i
was
speaking
with
babington
a
fortnight
ago
in
what
place
in
the
inn
called
the
bull
in
cheapside
good
i
have
lodged
there
myself
said
the
other
and
you
are
one
no
sir
said
robin
i
do
not
deny
that
i
spoke
with
them
all
with
charnoc
and
that
is
enough
of
those
names
sir
said
the
other
with
a
small
and
fearful
lift
of
his
white
eyebrows
as
if
he
dreaded
the
very
trees
that
nearly
met
overhead
in
this
place
and
what
is
your
business
i
have
satisfied
you
then
began
robin
not
at
all
sir
you
have
answered
sufficiently
so
far
that
is
all
i
wish
to
know
your
business
the
night
following
the
day
on
which
the
men
fled
of
whom
i
have
just
spoken
i
had
a
letter
from
from
their
leader
he
told
me
that
all
was
lost
and
he
gave
me
a
letter
to
her
grace
here
he
felt
the
thin
old
sinews
under
his
hand
contract
suddenly
and
paused
go
on
sir
whispered
the
old
voice
a
letter
to
her
grace
sir
i
was
to
use
my
discretion
whether
i
carried
it
with
me
or
learned
it
by
rote
i
have
other
interests
at
stake
besides
this
and
i
used
my
discretion
and
destroyed
the
letter
but
you
have
some
writing
no
doubt
i
have
none
said
robin
i
have
my
word
only
there
was
a
pause
was
the
message
private
private
only
to
her
grace
enemies
i
will
tell
you
the
substance
of
it
now
if
you
will
the
old
man
without
answering
steered
his
companion
nearer
to
the
wall
then
he
relinquished
the
supporting
arm
and
leaned
himself
against
the
stones
fixing
his
eyes
full
upon
the
priest
and
searching
as
it
seemed
every
feature
of
his
face
and
every
detail
of
his
dress
was
the
message
important
sir
important
only
to
those
who
value
love
and
fidelity
i
could
deliver
it
myself
then
certainly
sir
if
you
will
give
me
your
word
to
deliver
it
to
her
grace
as
i
deliver
it
to
you
and
to
none
else
i
will
ride
on
and
trouble
you
no
more
that
is
enough
said
the
physician
decidedly
i
am
completely
satisfied
alban
all
that
remains
is
to
consider
how
i
can
get
you
to
her
grace
but
if
you
yourself
will
deliver
began
robin
an
extraordinary
spasm
passed
over
the
other
face
that
might
denote
any
fierce
emotion
either
of
anger
or
grief
do
you
think
it
is
that
he
hissed
why
man
where
is
your
priesthood
do
you
think
the
poor
dame
within
would
not
give
her
soul
for
a
priest
why
i
have
prayed
god
night
and
day
to
send
us
a
priest
she
is
half
mad
with
sorrow
and
who
knows
whether
ever
again
in
this
world
he
broke
off
his
face
all
distorted
with
pain
and
robin
felt
a
strange
thrill
of
glory
at
the
thought
that
he
bore
with
him
in
virtue
of
his
priesthood
only
so
much
consolation
he
faced
for
the
first
time
that
tremendous
call
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
in
rheims
that
desolate
cry
of
souls
that
longed
and
longed
in
vain
for
those
gifts
which
a
priest
of
christ
could
alone
bestow
the
question
is
the
old
man
was
saying
more
quietly
how
to
get
you
in
to
her
grace
why
sir
amyas
opens
her
letters
even
and
reseals
them
again
he
thinks
me
a
fool
and
that
i
do
not
know
what
he
does
do
you
know
aught
of
medicine
he
asked
abruptly
i
know
only
what
country
folks
know
of
herbs
and
their
names
their
latin
names
man
pursued
the
other
leaning
forward
robin
half
smiled
now
you
speak
of
it
he
said
i
have
learned
a
good
many
as
a
pastime
when
i
was
a
boy
i
was
something
of
a
herbalist
even
but
i
have
forgotten
bah
that
would
be
enough
for
sir
amyas
he
turned
and
spat
venomously
at
the
name
sir
amyas
knows
nothing
save
his
own
vile
trade
he
is
a
lout
no
more
he
is
as
grim
as
a
goose
always
and
you
have
a
town
air
about
you
he
went
on
running
his
eyes
critically
over
the
young
man
dress
those
are
french
clothes
they
were
bought
in
france
the
two
stood
silent
robin
excitement
beat
in
all
his
veins
in
spite
of
his
weariness
he
had
come
to
bear
a
human
message
only
to
a
bereaved
queen
and
it
seemed
as
if
his
work
were
to
be
rather
the
bearing
of
a
divine
message
to
a
lonely
soul
he
watched
the
old
face
eagerly
it
was
sunk
in
thought
then
bourgoign
took
him
abruptly
by
the
arm
give
me
your
arm
again
he
said
i
am
an
old
man
we
must
be
going
back
again
it
seems
as
if
god
heard
our
prayers
after
all
i
will
see
you
disposed
for
you
and
your
man
and
the
horses
and
i
will
send
for
you
myself
in
the
morning
could
you
say
mass
think
you
if
i
found
you
a
secure
place
and
bring
our
lord
body
with
you
in
the
morning
he
checked
the
young
man
to
hear
his
answer
why
yes
said
robin
i
have
all
things
that
are
needed
then
you
shall
say
mass
in
any
case
and
reserve
our
lord
body
in
a
pyx
now
listen
to
me
if
my
plan
falls
as
i
hope
you
must
be
a
physician
and
have
practised
your
trade
in
paris
you
have
been
in
paris
no
sir
bah
well
no
more
has
sir
amyas
you
have
practised
your
trade
in
paris
and
god
has
given
you
great
skill
in
the
matter
of
herbs
and
upon
hearing
that
i
was
in
chartley
you
inquired
for
your
old
friend
whose
acquaintance
you
had
made
in
paris
five
years
ago
and
i
upon
hearing
you
were
come
secured
your
willingness
to
see
my
patient
if
you
would
but
consent
your
reputation
has
reached
me
even
here
you
have
attended
his
majesty
in
paris
on
three
occasions
you
restored
mademoiselle
élise
of
the
family
of
guise
from
the
very
point
of
death
you
are
but
a
young
man
still
yet
bah
it
is
arranged
you
understand
now
come
with
me
chapter
iv
i
in
spite
of
his
plans
and
his
hopes
and
his
dreams
it
was
with
an
amazement
beyond
all
telling
that
robert
alban
found
himself
at
nine
next
morning
conducted
by
two
men
through
the
hall
at
chartley
to
the
little
parlour
where
he
was
to
await
sir
amyas
paulet
and
the
queen
apothecary
matters
had
been
arranged
last
night
with
that
promptness
which
alone
could
make
the
tale
possible
he
had
walked
back
with
the
old
man
in
full
view
of
the
little
hamlet
to
all
appearances
the
best
of
old
friends
and
after
providing
for
a
room
in
the
sick
woman
house
for
robin
himself
another
in
another
house
for
arnold
and
stabling
for
the
horses
in
a
shed
where
occasionally
the
spent
horses
of
the
couriers
were
housed
when
chartley
stables
were
overflowing
after
all
this
had
been
arranged
by
bourgoign
in
person
the
two
walked
on
to
the
great
gates
of
the
park
where
they
took
an
affectionate
farewell
within
hearing
of
the
sentry
the
apothecary
promising
to
see
sir
amyas
that
night
and
to
communicate
with
his
friend
in
the
morning
robin
had
learned
previously
how
strict
was
the
watch
set
about
the
person
particularly
since
the
news
of
the
babington
plot
had
first
reached
the
authorities
and
of
the
extraordinary
difficulty
to
the
approach
of
any
stranger
to
her
presence
nau
and
curle
her
two
secretaries
had
been
arrested
and
perhaps
racked
a
week
or
ten
days
before
all
the
queen
papers
had
been
taken
from
her
and
even
her
jewellery
and
pictures
sent
off
to
elizabeth
and
the
only
persons
ordinarily
allowed
to
speak
with
her
besides
her
gaoler
were
two
of
her
women
and
bourgoign
himself
that
morning
then
before
six
robin
had
said
mass
in
the
sick
woman
room
and
given
her
communion
with
her
companion
who
answered
his
mass
as
it
was
thought
more
prudent
that
the
other
priest
should
not
even
be
present
and
at
the
close
of
the
mass
he
had
reserved
in
a
little
pyx
hidden
beneath
his
clothes
a
consecrated
particle
bourgoign
had
said
that
he
would
see
to
it
that
the
queen
should
be
fasting
up
to
ten
that
day
and
now
the
last
miracle
had
been
accomplished
a
servant
had
come
down
late
the
night
before
with
a
discreet
letter
from
the
apothecary
saying
that
sir
amyas
had
consented
to
receive
and
examine
for
himself
the
travelling
physician
from
paris
and
here
now
went
robin
striving
to
remember
the
old
latin
names
he
had
learned
as
a
boy
and
to
carry
a
medical
air
with
him
the
parlour
in
which
he
found
himself
was
furnished
severely
and
even
rather
sparely
owing
perhaps
he
thought
to
the
temporary
nature
of
the
household
it
was
the
custom
in
great
houses
to
carry
with
the
family
from
house
to
house
all
luxuries
such
as
extra
hangings
or
painted
pictures
or
carpets
as
well
as
even
such
things
as
cooking
utensils
and
in
the
queen
sudden
removal
back
again
from
tixall
many
matters
must
have
been
neglected
the
oak
wainscoting
was
completely
bare
and
over
the
upper
parts
of
the
walls
in
many
places
the
stones
showed
through
between
the
tapestries
a
sheaf
of
pikes
stood
in
one
corner
an
oil
portrait
of
an
unknown
worthy
in
the
dress
of
fifty
years
ago
hung
over
one
of
the
doors
a
large
round
oak
table
with
and
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
with
stools
beside
it
there
was
no
hearth
or
chimney
visible
and
there
was
no
tapestry
upon
the
floor
a
skin
only
lay
between
the
windows
the
priest
sat
down
and
waited
he
had
enough
to
occupy
his
mind
for
not
only
had
he
the
thought
of
the
character
he
was
to
sustain
presently
under
the
scrutiny
of
a
suspicious
man
but
he
had
the
prospect
as
he
hoped
of
coming
into
the
presence
of
the
woman
in
europe
and
of
ministering
to
her
as
a
priest
alone
could
do
in
her
sorest
need
his
hand
went
to
his
breast
as
he
considered
it
and
remembered
what
he
bore
and
he
felt
the
tiny
flat
circular
case
press
upon
his
heart
for
his
imagination
was
all
aflame
at
the
thought
of
mary
not
only
had
he
been
kindled
again
and
again
in
the
old
days
by
poor
anthony
talk
until
the
woman
seemed
to
him
already
but
man
after
man
had
repeated
the
same
tale
that
she
was
in
truth
that
which
her
lean
cousin
of
england
desired
to
be
thought
a
very
paragon
of
women
innocent
holy
undefiled
yet
of
charm
to
drive
men
to
their
knees
before
her
presence
it
was
said
that
she
was
as
one
of
those
strange
moths
which
confined
behind
glass
will
draw
their
mates
out
of
the
darkness
to
beat
themselves
to
death
against
her
prison
she
was
exquisite
they
said
in
her
pale
beauty
and
yet
more
exquisite
in
her
pain
she
exuded
a
faint
and
intoxicating
perfume
of
womanliness
like
a
crushed
herb
yet
she
was
to
be
worshipped
rather
than
loved
a
sacrament
to
be
approached
kneeling
an
incarnate
breath
of
heaven
the
more
lovely
from
the
vileness
into
which
her
life
had
been
cast
and
the
slanders
that
were
about
her
name
more
marvellous
than
all
was
that
those
who
knew
her
best
and
longest
loved
her
most
her
servants
wept
or
groaned
themselves
into
fevers
if
they
were
excluded
from
her
too
long
of
her
as
of
the
wisdom
of
old
might
it
be
said
that
they
who
ate
her
hungered
yet
and
they
who
drank
her
thirsted
it
was
to
this
miracle
of
humanity
then
that
this
priest
was
to
come
he
sat
up
suddenly
once
more
pressing
his
hand
to
his
breast
where
his
treasure
lay
hidden
as
he
heard
steps
crossing
the
paved
hall
outside
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
bowed
as
a
tall
man
came
swiftly
in
followed
by
the
apothecary
ii
it
was
a
lean
man
that
he
saw
and
grim
as
a
goose
as
the
physician
had
said
wearing
even
in
this
guarded
household
a
and
cap
of
steel
a
long
sword
jingled
beside
him
on
the
stone
floor
and
clashed
with
his
spurred
boots
he
appeared
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
the
companion
of
a
sorrowing
queen
and
it
was
precisely
for
this
reason
that
he
had
been
chosen
to
replace
the
courtly
lord
shrewsbury
and
the
gentle
sir
ralph
sadler
her
grace
of
england
said
that
she
had
had
enough
of
nurses
for
gaolers
his
voice
too
resembled
the
bitter
clash
of
a
key
in
a
lock
well
sir
he
said
abruptly
bourgoign
tells
me
you
are
a
friend
of
his
i
have
that
honour
sir
you
met
in
paris
eh
and
you
profess
a
knowledge
of
herbs
beyond
the
ordinary
bourgoign
is
good
enough
to
say
so
and
you
are
after
her
grace
of
scotland
as
they
call
her
like
all
the
rest
of
them
eh
i
shall
be
happy
to
put
what
art
i
possess
at
her
grace
of
service
traitors
say
as
much
as
that
sir
in
the
cause
of
treachery
no
doubt
sir
sir
amyas
barked
a
kind
of
laugh
avez
he
said
with
a
deplorable
accent
as
her
grace
would
say
and
you
come
purely
by
chance
to
chartley
no
doubt
the
sneer
was
unmistakable
robin
met
it
full
not
for
one
moment
sir
i
was
on
my
way
to
derby
i
could
have
saved
a
few
miles
if
i
had
struck
north
long
ago
but
chartley
is
interesting
in
these
days
he
saw
bourgoign
eyes
gleam
with
satisfaction
that
is
honest
at
least
sir
and
why
is
chartley
interesting
because
her
grace
is
here
answered
robin
with
sublime
simplicity
sir
amyas
barked
again
it
seemed
he
liked
this
way
of
talk
for
a
moment
or
two
his
eyes
searched
robin
hard
narrow
eyes
like
a
dog
he
looked
him
up
and
down
where
are
your
drugs
sir
robin
smiled
a
herbalist
does
not
need
to
carry
drugs
he
said
they
grow
in
every
hedgerow
if
a
man
has
eyes
to
see
what
god
has
given
him
that
is
true
enough
i
would
we
had
more
talk
about
god
his
majesty
in
this
household
and
less
of
popish
trinkets
and
well
sir
do
you
think
you
can
cure
her
ladyship
i
have
no
opinion
on
the
point
at
all
sir
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
her
beyond
what
bourgoign
has
told
me
he
added
hastily
remembering
the
supposed
situation
the
soldier
paid
no
attention
like
all
men
he
was
following
up
an
irrelevant
train
of
thought
from
his
own
last
sentence
but
one
he
said
again
i
am
sick
of
her
megrims
and
her
vapours
and
her
humours
has
she
not
blood
and
bones
like
the
rest
of
us
and
yet
she
can
not
take
her
food
nor
her
drink
nor
sleep
like
an
honest
woman
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
for
that
is
what
she
is
not
they
will
say
she
is
poisoned
i
dare
say
well
sir
i
suppose
you
had
best
see
her
but
in
my
presence
remember
sir
in
my
presence
robin
spirits
sank
like
a
stone
moreover
he
would
be
instantly
detected
as
a
knave
though
that
honestly
seemed
a
lesser
matter
to
him
if
he
attempted
to
talk
medically
in
sir
amyas
presence
unless
that
warrior
was
truly
as
great
a
clod
as
he
seemed
he
determined
to
risk
it
he
bowed
i
can
at
least
try
my
poor
skill
sir
he
said
sir
amyas
instantly
turned
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
to
beckon
them
and
clanked
out
again
into
the
hall
there
was
not
a
moment
opportunity
for
the
two
conspirators
to
exchange
even
a
word
for
there
in
the
hall
stood
the
two
men
who
had
brought
robin
in
to
keep
guard
and
as
the
party
passed
through
to
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
he
saw
on
each
landing
that
was
in
sight
another
sentry
and
at
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
overhead
gallery
against
which
hung
a
heavy
velvet
curtain
stood
the
last
a
stern
figure
to
keep
guard
on
the
rooms
of
a
queen
with
his
complete
a
steel
hat
on
his
head
and
a
pike
in
his
hand
it
was
to
this
door
that
sir
amyas
went
acknowledging
with
a
lift
of
the
finger
the
salute
of
his
men
it
was
plain
that
this
place
was
under
strict
military
discipline
with
the
two
the
real
and
the
false
physician
following
him
he
pulled
aside
the
curtain
and
rapped
imperiously
on
the
door
it
was
opened
after
a
moment
delay
by
a
woman
her
grace
demanded
the
officer
sharply
is
she
still
abed
her
grace
is
risen
sir
said
the
woman
tremulously
she
is
in
the
inner
room
sir
amyas
strode
straight
on
pulled
aside
a
second
curtain
hanging
over
the
further
door
rapped
upon
that
too
and
without
even
waiting
for
an
answer
this
time
beyond
the
shrill
barking
of
dogs
within
opened
it
and
passed
in
bourgoign
followed
and
robin
came
last
the
door
closed
softly
behind
him
iii
the
room
was
furnished
with
more
decency
than
any
he
had
seen
in
this
harsh
house
for
although
at
the
time
he
thought
that
he
had
no
eyes
for
anything
but
one
figure
which
it
contained
he
found
himself
afterwards
able
to
give
a
very
tolerable
account
of
its
general
appearance
the
walls
were
hung
throughout
with
a
velvet
hanging
stamped
with
silver
there
were
tapestries
on
the
floor
between
which
gleamed
the
polished
oak
boards
perfectly
kept
by
the
labours
no
doubt
of
her
grace
two
women
since
such
things
would
be
mere
to
the
honest
soldier
a
graceful
french
table
ran
down
the
centre
of
the
room
very
delicately
carved
and
beneath
it
two
baskets
from
which
looked
out
the
indignant
heads
of
a
couple
of
little
spaniels
upon
it
at
the
nearer
end
were
three
or
four
cages
of
in
this
room
old
curtains
of
the
same
material
as
that
which
hung
on
the
walls
shrouded
the
two
windows
on
the
right
letting
but
a
half
light
into
the
room
there
was
a
further
door
also
curtained
diagonally
opposite
that
by
which
the
party
had
entered
and
in
the
centre
of
the
same
wall
a
tall
blue
canopy
fringed
with
silver
rose
to
the
ceiling
beneath
it
on
a
daïs
of
a
single
step
stood
a
velvet
chair
with
gilded
arms
and
worked
with
the
royal
shield
in
the
embroidery
of
the
back
with
a
crowned
lion
for
the
crest
above
the
crown
half
a
dozen
more
chairs
were
ranged
about
the
table
and
on
a
couch
with
her
feet
swathed
in
draperies
with
a
woman
standing
over
her
behind
as
if
she
had
just
risen
up
from
speaking
in
her
ear
lay
the
queen
of
the
scots
a
tall
silver
and
ebony
crucifix
with
a
couple
of
little
books
stood
on
the
table
within
reach
of
her
hand
and
a
folded
handkerchief
beside
them
mary
was
past
her
prime
long
ago
she
was
worn
with
sorrow
and
slanders
and
miseries
yet
she
appeared
to
the
priest
eyes
even
then
like
a
figure
of
a
dream
it
was
partly
no
doubt
the
faintness
of
the
light
that
came
in
through
the
windows
that
obliterated
the
lines
and
fallen
patches
that
her
face
was
beginning
to
bear
and
she
lay
too
with
her
back
even
to
such
light
as
there
was
yet
for
all
that
and
even
if
he
had
not
known
who
she
was
robin
could
not
have
taken
his
eyes
from
her
face
she
lay
there
like
a
fallen
flower
pale
as
a
lily
beaten
down
at
last
by
the
waves
and
storms
that
had
gone
over
her
and
she
was
more
beautiful
in
her
downfall
and
disgrace
a
thousand
times
than
when
she
had
come
first
to
holyrood
or
danced
in
the
courts
of
france
now
it
is
not
in
the
features
one
by
one
that
beauty
lies
but
rather
in
the
coincidence
of
them
all
her
face
was
almost
waxen
now
blue
shadowed
beneath
the
two
waves
of
pale
hair
she
had
a
small
mouth
a
delicate
nose
and
large
searching
hazel
eyes
her
was
of
white
with
silver
pins
in
it
a
light
white
shawl
was
clasped
over
her
shoulders
and
she
wore
a
loose
brocaded
beneath
it
her
hands
clasped
as
if
in
prayer
emerged
out
of
deep
sleeves
and
were
covered
with
rings
but
it
was
the
air
of
almost
superhuman
delicacy
that
breathed
from
her
most
forcibly
and
when
she
spoke
a
ring
of
assured
decision
revealed
her
quiet
consciousness
of
royalty
it
was
an
extraordinary
mingling
of
fragility
and
power
of
which
this
feminine
and
royal
room
was
the
proper
frame
sir
amyas
knelt
perfunctorily
as
if
impatient
of
it
and
rose
up
again
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
signal
mary
lifted
her
fingers
a
little
as
a
sign
to
the
other
two
i
have
brought
the
french
doctor
madam
said
the
soldier
abruptly
but
he
must
see
your
grace
in
my
presence
then
you
might
as
well
have
spared
him
and
yourself
the
pains
sir
came
the
quiet
dignified
voice
i
do
not
choose
to
be
examined
in
your
presence
robin
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
face
but
although
he
thought
he
caught
an
under
air
of
intense
desire
towards
him
and
that
which
he
bore
there
was
no
faltering
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
it
was
as
some
man
said
as
soft
as
running
water
heard
by
night
this
is
absurd
madam
i
am
responsible
for
your
grace
security
and
good
health
but
there
are
lengths
you
have
spoken
the
very
word
said
the
queen
there
are
lengths
to
which
none
of
us
should
go
even
to
preserve
our
health
i
tell
you
madam
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
sir
said
the
queen
closing
her
eyes
again
but
what
do
i
know
of
this
fellow
how
can
i
tell
he
is
what
he
professes
to
be
barked
sir
amyas
then
you
should
never
have
admitted
him
at
all
said
the
queen
opening
her
eyes
again
and
i
will
do
the
best
that
i
can
but
madam
your
health
is
my
care
and
bourgoign
here
tells
me
the
subject
does
not
interest
me
murmured
the
queen
apparently
half
asleep
but
i
will
retire
to
the
corner
and
turn
my
back
if
that
is
necessary
growled
the
soldier
there
was
no
answer
she
lay
with
closed
eyes
and
her
woman
began
again
to
fan
her
gently
robin
began
to
understand
the
situation
a
little
better
it
was
plain
that
sir
amyas
was
a
great
deal
more
anxious
for
the
queen
health
than
he
pretended
to
be
or
he
would
never
have
tolerated
such
objections
the
queen
too
must
know
of
this
or
she
would
not
have
ventured
with
so
much
at
stake
to
treat
him
with
such
maddening
rebuffs
there
had
been
rumours
verified
later
that
elizabeth
had
actually
caused
it
to
be
suggested
to
sir
amyas
that
he
should
poison
his
prisoner
decently
and
privately
and
thereby
save
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
scandal
and
that
sir
amyas
had
refused
with
indignation
perhaps
if
all
this
were
true
thought
robin
the
officer
was
especially
careful
on
this
very
account
that
the
queen
health
should
be
above
suspicion
he
remembered
that
sir
amyas
had
referred
just
now
to
a
suspicion
of
poison
he
determined
on
the
bold
line
her
grace
has
spoken
sir
he
said
modestly
and
i
think
i
should
have
a
word
to
say
it
is
plain
to
me
by
looking
at
her
grace
that
her
health
is
very
far
from
what
it
should
be
he
paused
significantly
i
should
have
to
make
a
thorough
examination
if
i
prescribed
at
all
and
even
should
her
grace
consent
to
this
being
done
publicly
for
my
part
i
would
not
consent
i
should
be
happy
to
have
her
women
here
but
sir
amyas
turned
on
him
wrathfully
why
sir
you
said
downstairs
i
had
not
then
seen
her
grace
but
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
he
kneeled
again
as
if
to
take
his
leave
stood
up
and
began
to
retire
to
the
door
bourgoign
stood
helpless
then
sir
amyas
yielded
you
shall
have
fifteen
minutes
sir
no
more
he
cried
harshly
and
i
shall
remain
in
the
next
room
he
made
a
perfunctory
salute
and
strode
out
the
queen
opened
her
eyes
waited
for
one
tense
instant
till
the
door
closed
then
she
slipped
swiftly
off
the
couch
the
door
she
whispered
the
woman
was
across
the
room
in
an
instant
on
and
drew
the
single
slender
bolt
the
queen
made
a
sharp
gesture
the
woman
fled
back
again
on
one
side
and
out
through
the
further
door
and
the
old
man
hobbled
after
her
it
was
as
if
every
detail
had
been
rehearsed
the
door
closed
noiselessly
then
the
queen
rose
up
as
robin
understanding
began
to
fumble
with
his
breast
and
as
he
drew
out
the
pyx
and
placed
it
on
the
handkerchief
in
reality
a
corporal
apparently
so
carelessly
laid
by
the
crucifix
mary
sank
down
in
adoration
of
her
lord
now
she
whispered
still
kneeling
but
lifting
her
eyes
and
the
priest
went
across
to
the
couch
where
the
queen
had
lain
and
sat
down
on
it
nomine
patris
et
filii
et
spiritus
began
mary
iv
when
the
confession
was
finished
robin
went
across
at
the
order
and
tapped
with
his
upon
the
door
while
she
herself
remained
on
her
knees
the
door
opened
instantly
and
the
two
came
in
the
woman
first
bearing
two
lighted
tapers
she
set
these
down
one
on
either
side
of
the
crucifix
and
herself
knelt
with
the
old
physician
then
robin
gave
holy
communion
to
the
queen
of
the
scots
v
she
was
back
again
on
her
couch
now
once
more
as
as
ever
the
candlesticks
were
gone
again
the
handkerchief
still
in
its
place
and
the
woman
back
again
behind
the
couch
the
two
men
kneeled
close
beside
her
near
enough
to
hear
every
whisper
listen
gentlemen
she
said
softly
i
can
not
tell
you
what
you
have
done
for
my
soul
both
of
you
since
i
could
never
have
had
the
priest
without
my
friend
i
can
not
reward
you
but
our
lord
will
do
so
abundantly
listen
i
know
that
i
am
going
to
my
death
and
i
thank
god
that
i
have
made
my
peace
with
him
i
do
not
know
if
they
will
allow
me
to
see
a
priest
again
but
i
wish
to
say
this
to
both
of
you
as
i
said
just
now
in
my
confession
to
you
that
i
am
wholly
and
utterly
guiltless
of
the
plot
laid
to
my
charge
that
i
had
neither
part
nor
wish
nor
consent
in
it
i
desired
only
to
escape
from
my
captivity
i
would
have
made
war
if
i
could
yes
but
as
for
accomplishing
or
assisting
in
her
grace
death
the
thought
was
never
near
me
those
whom
i
thought
my
friends
have
entrapped
me
and
have
given
colour
to
the
tale
i
pray
our
saviour
to
forgive
them
as
i
do
and
with
that
saviour
now
in
my
breast
i
tell
you
and
you
may
tell
all
the
world
if
you
will
that
i
am
guiltless
of
what
they
impute
to
me
i
shall
die
for
my
religion
and
nothing
but
that
and
i
thank
you
again
père
et
vous
mon
ami
que
vous
her
voice
died
away
in
inaudible
french
and
her
eyes
closed
robin
eyes
were
raining
tears
but
he
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
hand
as
it
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
he
felt
himself
touched
on
the
shoulder
and
he
stood
up
the
old
man
eyes
too
were
brimming
with
tears
i
must
let
sir
amyas
in
he
whispered
you
must
be
ready
what
shall
i
say
say
that
you
will
prescribe
privately
to
me
and
that
her
health
is
indeed
delicate
but
not
gravely
impaired
you
understand
robin
nodded
passing
his
sleeve
over
his
eyes
the
woman
touched
the
queen
shoulder
to
rouse
her
and
bourgoign
opened
the
door
vi
and
now
sir
said
bourgoign
as
the
two
passed
out
from
the
house
half
an
hour
later
i
have
one
more
word
to
say
to
you
listen
carefully
if
you
please
for
there
is
not
much
time
he
glanced
behind
him
but
the
tall
figure
was
gone
from
the
door
there
remained
only
the
two
pikemen
that
kept
ward
over
the
great
house
on
the
steps
come
this
way
said
the
physician
and
led
the
priest
through
into
the
little
walled
garden
on
the
south
he
will
think
we
are
finishing
our
consultation
i
can
not
tell
you
he
said
presently
all
that
i
think
of
your
courage
and
your
wit
you
made
a
bold
stroke
when
you
told
him
you
would
begone
again
unless
you
could
see
her
grace
alone
and
again
when
you
said
you
had
come
to
chartley
because
she
was
here
and
you
may
go
again
now
knowing
you
have
comforted
a
woman
in
her
greatest
need
they
sent
her
chaplain
from
her
when
she
left
here
for
tixall
in
july
and
she
has
not
had
him
again
yet
she
is
watched
at
every
point
they
have
taken
all
her
papers
from
her
and
have
seduced
nau
i
fear
did
you
hear
anything
of
him
in
town
no
said
the
priest
i
know
nothing
of
him
he
is
a
frenchman
and
hath
been
with
her
grace
more
than
ten
years
he
hath
written
her
letters
for
her
and
been
privy
to
all
her
counsels
and
i
fear
he
hath
been
seduced
from
her
at
last
it
was
said
that
walsingham
was
to
take
him
into
his
house
well
but
we
have
not
time
for
this
what
i
have
to
ask
you
is
whether
you
could
come
again
to
us
he
peered
at
the
priest
almost
timorously
robin
was
startled
come
again
he
said
why
you
see
you
have
already
won
to
her
presence
and
sir
amyas
is
committed
to
it
that
you
are
a
safe
man
i
shall
tell
her
grace
too
that
she
must
eat
and
drink
well
and
get
better
if
she
would
see
you
again
for
that
will
establish
you
in
sir
amyas
eyes
but
will
she
not
have
a
priest
i
know
nothing
alban
they
even
shut
me
up
here
when
they
took
her
to
tixall
and
even
now
none
but
myself
and
her
two
women
have
access
to
her
i
do
not
know
even
if
her
grace
will
be
left
here
there
has
been
talk
among
the
men
of
going
to
fotheringay
i
know
nothing
from
day
to
day
it
is
a
a
but
they
will
certainly
do
what
they
can
to
shake
her
it
grows
more
rigorous
every
day
and
i
thought
that
if
you
would
tell
me
whether
a
message
could
reach
you
and
if
her
chaplain
is
not
allowed
to
see
her
again
you
might
be
able
to
come
again
i
would
tell
sir
amyas
how
much
good
you
had
done
to
her
last
time
with
your
herbs
and
it
might
be
you
could
see
her
again
in
a
month
or
two
perhaps
or
later
robin
was
silent
the
greatness
of
the
affair
terrified
him
yet
its
melancholy
drew
him
he
had
seen
her
on
whom
all
england
bent
its
thoughts
at
this
time
who
was
a
crowned
queen
with
broad
lands
and
wealth
who
called
elizabeth
sister
yet
who
was
more
of
a
prisoner
than
any
in
the
fleet
or
westminster
gatehouse
since
those
at
least
could
have
their
friends
to
come
to
them
her
hidden
fires
too
had
warmed
him
that
passion
for
god
that
had
burst
from
her
when
her
gaoler
left
her
and
she
had
flung
herself
on
her
knees
before
her
hidden
saviour
it
may
be
he
had
doubted
her
before
he
did
not
know
but
there
was
no
more
doubt
in
him
after
her
protestation
of
her
innocence
he
began
to
see
now
that
she
stood
for
more
than
her
kingdom
or
her
son
or
the
plots
attributed
to
her
that
she
was
more
than
a
mere
great
woman
for
whose
sake
men
could
both
live
and
die
he
began
to
see
in
her
that
which
poor
anthony
had
seen
a
champion
for
the
faith
of
them
all
an
incarnate
suffering
symbol
in
flesh
and
blood
of
that
religion
for
which
he
too
was
in
peril
that
religion
which
in
spite
of
all
clamour
to
the
contrary
was
the
real
of
england
life
he
turned
then
to
the
old
man
with
a
suddenly
flushed
face
a
message
will
always
reach
me
at
mistress
manners
house
at
edge
near
hathersage
in
derbyshire
and
i
will
come
from
there
or
from
the
world
end
to
serve
her
grace
chapter
v
i
first
give
me
your
blessing
alban
said
marjorie
kneeling
down
before
him
in
the
hall
in
front
of
them
all
she
was
as
pale
as
a
ghost
but
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
it
was
a
couple
of
months
after
his
leaving
chartley
before
he
came
at
last
to
booth
edge
first
he
had
had
to
bestow
arnold
in
lancashire
for
suspicion
was
abroad
and
it
was
a
letter
from
marjorie
herself
reaching
him
in
derby
at
biddell
house
that
had
told
him
of
it
and
bidden
him
go
on
with
his
friend
the
town
had
never
been
the
same
since
topcliffe
visit
and
now
that
babington
house
was
no
longer
in
safe
catholic
hands
a
great
protection
was
gone
he
had
better
go
on
she
said
as
if
he
were
what
he
professed
to
be
a
gentleman
travelling
with
his
servant
a
rumour
had
come
to
her
ears
that
the
talk
in
the
town
was
of
the
expected
arrival
of
a
new
priest
to
take
garlick
place
for
the
present
and
every
stranger
was
scrutinised
so
he
had
taken
her
advice
he
had
left
derby
again
immediately
and
had
slowly
travelled
north
then
coming
round
about
from
the
north
after
leaving
his
friend
saying
mass
here
and
there
where
he
could
crossing
into
yorkshire
even
as
far
west
as
wakefield
he
had
come
at
last
through
this
wet
november
day
along
the
derwent
valley
and
up
to
booth
edge
where
he
arrived
after
sunset
to
find
the
hall
filled
with
folks
to
greet
him
he
was
smiling
himself
though
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
by
the
time
that
he
had
done
giving
his
blessings
john
fitzherbert
was
come
up
from
padley
where
he
lived
now
for
short
times
together
greyer
than
ever
but
with
the
same
resolute
face
mistress
alice
babington
was
there
still
serene
looking
but
with
a
new
sorrow
in
her
eyes
and
clinging
to
her
a
thin
pale
girl
all
in
black
who
only
two
months
before
had
lost
both
daughter
and
husband
for
the
child
had
died
scarcely
a
week
or
two
before
her
father
anthony
babington
had
died
miserably
on
the
gallows
near
giles
fields
where
he
had
so
often
met
his
friends
after
dark
it
was
a
ghastly
tale
told
in
fragments
to
robin
here
and
there
during
his
journeyings
by
men
in
taverns
before
whom
he
must
keep
a
brave
face
and
a
few
farmers
were
there
old
merton
among
them
come
in
to
welcome
the
son
of
the
squire
of
matstead
returned
under
a
feigned
name
unknown
even
to
his
father
and
there
too
was
honest
dick
sampson
come
up
from
dethick
to
see
his
old
master
so
here
in
the
hall
he
knew
so
well
himself
splashed
with
red
marl
from
ankle
to
shoulder
still
cloaked
and
spurred
one
by
one
these
knelt
before
him
beginning
with
marjorie
herself
and
ending
with
the
youngest
who
breathed
heavily
as
he
knelt
down
and
got
up
and
staring
and
his
reverence
will
hear
confessions
proclaimed
marjorie
to
the
multitude
at
eight
and
he
will
say
mass
and
give
holy
communion
at
six
morning
ii
he
had
to
hear
that
night
after
supper
and
before
he
went
to
keep
his
engagement
in
the
the
entire
news
of
the
county
and
in
his
turn
to
tell
his
own
adventures
the
company
sat
together
before
the
great
to
take
the
dessert
since
there
would
have
been
no
room
in
the
parlour
for
all
who
wished
to
hear
he
heard
the
tale
of
thomas
fitzherbert
traitor
apostate
and
sworn
man
of
her
grace
later
when
he
had
come
down
again
from
the
and
the
servants
had
gone
but
now
it
was
of
less
tragic
matters
and
more
triumphant
that
they
talked
he
told
of
his
adventures
since
he
had
landed
in
august
of
his
riding
in
lancashire
and
yorkshire
and
of
the
fervour
that
he
met
with
there
in
one
place
he
said
he
had
reconciled
the
old
minister
of
the
parish
that
had
been
made
priest
under
mary
thirty
years
ago
and
now
lay
dying
but
he
said
nothing
at
that
time
of
what
he
had
seen
of
her
grace
of
scotland
and
chartley
and
the
rest
on
the
other
hand
talked
of
what
had
passed
in
derby
of
all
that
ludlam
and
garlick
had
done
of
the
arrest
and
banishment
of
the
latter
and
his
immediate
return
of
the
hanging
of
francis
ingolby
in
york
which
had
made
a
great
stir
in
the
north
that
summer
since
he
was
the
son
of
sir
francis
of
ripley
castle
as
well
as
of
the
deaths
of
many
others
finglow
in
august
sandys
in
the
same
month
in
gloucester
and
of
lowe
adams
and
dibdale
all
together
at
tyburn
the
news
of
which
had
but
just
come
to
derbyshire
and
of
mistress
clitheroe
that
had
been
pressed
to
death
in
york
for
the
very
crime
which
mistress
marjorie
manners
was
perpetrating
at
this
moment
namely
the
assistance
and
harbourage
of
priests
or
rather
for
refusing
to
plead
when
she
had
been
arrested
for
that
crime
lest
she
should
bring
them
into
trouble
and
then
at
last
they
began
to
speak
of
mary
in
fotheringay
and
at
that
a
maid
came
in
to
say
that
it
was
eight
and
would
his
reverence
come
up
as
a
few
had
to
travel
home
that
night
and
to
come
again
next
day
it
was
after
nine
before
he
came
downstairs
again
to
find
the
gentlefolk
alone
in
the
little
parlour
that
opened
from
the
hall
it
gave
him
a
strange
thrill
of
pleasure
to
see
them
there
in
the
firelight
the
four
of
them
only
john
in
the
midst
with
the
three
ladies
and
an
empty
chair
waiting
for
the
priest
he
would
hear
their
confessions
presently
when
the
servants
were
gone
to
bed
a
great
mug
of
warm
ale
stood
by
his
place
to
comfort
him
after
his
long
ride
and
his
spiritual
labours
john
told
him
first
the
news
of
his
own
son
as
was
his
duty
to
do
and
he
told
it
without
bitterness
in
a
level
voice
leaning
his
cheek
on
his
hand
it
appeared
that
thomas
still
passed
for
a
catholic
among
the
simpler
folk
but
with
none
else
all
the
great
houses
round
about
had
the
truth
as
an
open
secret
and
their
doors
were
closed
to
him
neither
had
any
priest
been
near
him
since
the
day
when
simpson
met
him
alone
on
the
moors
and
spoke
to
him
of
his
soul
even
then
thomas
had
blustered
and
declared
that
there
was
no
truth
in
the
tale
and
had
so
ridden
away
at
last
saying
that
such
pestering
was
enough
to
make
a
man
lose
his
religion
altogether
as
for
me
said
john
he
has
not
been
near
me
nor
i
near
him
he
lives
at
norbury
for
the
most
part
my
brother
is
attempting
to
set
aside
the
disposition
he
had
made
in
his
favour
but
they
say
that
it
will
be
made
to
stand
and
that
my
son
will
get
it
all
yet
but
he
has
not
troubled
us
at
padley
nor
will
he
i
think
he
is
at
norbury
you
say
sir
yes
but
he
goes
here
and
there
continually
he
has
been
to
london
to
lay
informations
i
have
no
doubt
for
i
know
that
he
hath
been
seen
there
in
topcliffe
company
it
seems
that
we
are
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
conflict
we
have
had
above
a
dozen
priests
in
this
county
alone
arraigned
for
treason
and
the
most
of
them
executed
his
voice
had
gone
lower
and
trembled
once
or
twice
as
he
talked
it
was
plain
that
he
could
not
bear
to
speak
much
more
against
the
son
that
had
turned
against
him
and
his
faith
for
the
sake
of
his
own
liberty
and
the
estates
he
had
hoped
to
have
robin
made
haste
to
turn
the
talk
and
my
father
sir
john
looked
at
him
tenderly
you
must
ask
mistress
marjorie
of
him
he
said
i
have
not
seen
him
these
three
years
robin
turned
to
the
girl
i
have
had
no
more
news
of
him
since
what
i
wrote
to
you
she
said
quietly
after
i
had
spoken
with
him
and
he
had
given
me
the
warning
he
held
himself
aloof
hath
he
been
at
any
of
the
trials
at
derby
she
bowed
her
head
he
was
at
the
trial
of
garlick
she
said
last
year
and
was
one
of
those
who
spoke
for
his
banishment
and
then
on
a
sudden
mistress
alice
moved
in
her
corner
where
she
sat
with
the
widow
of
her
brother
and
what
of
her
grace
she
said
is
it
true
what
dick
told
us
before
supper
that
parliament
hath
sentenced
her
robin
shook
his
head
i
hear
so
much
gossip
he
said
in
the
taverns
that
i
believe
nothing
i
had
not
heard
that
tell
me
what
it
was
he
was
in
a
torment
of
mind
as
to
what
he
should
say
of
his
own
adventure
at
chartley
on
the
one
side
it
was
plain
that
no
rumour
of
the
tale
must
get
abroad
or
he
would
never
be
able
to
come
to
her
again
on
the
other
side
no
word
had
come
from
bourgoign
though
two
months
had
passed
he
knew
indeed
what
all
the
world
knew
by
now
that
a
trial
had
been
held
by
over
forty
lords
in
fotheringay
castle
whither
the
queen
had
been
moved
at
the
end
of
september
and
that
reports
had
been
sent
of
it
to
london
but
for
the
rest
he
knew
no
more
than
the
others
tales
ran
about
the
country
on
every
side
one
man
would
say
that
he
had
it
from
london
direct
that
parliament
had
sentenced
her
another
that
the
queen
of
england
had
given
her
consent
too
a
third
that
parliament
had
not
dared
to
touch
the
matter
at
all
a
fourth
that
elizabeth
had
pardoned
her
but
for
robin
his
hesitation
largely
lay
in
his
knowledge
that
it
was
on
the
babington
plot
that
all
would
turn
and
that
this
would
have
been
the
chief
charge
against
her
and
here
but
a
yard
away
from
him
in
the
gloom
of
the
sat
anthony
wife
and
sister
how
could
he
say
that
this
was
so
and
yet
that
he
believed
her
wholly
innocent
of
a
crime
which
he
detested
he
had
dreaded
this
talk
the
instant
that
he
had
seen
them
in
the
hall
and
heard
their
names
but
mistress
alice
would
not
be
put
off
she
repeated
what
she
had
said
dick
had
come
up
from
dethick
only
that
afternoon
and
was
now
gone
again
so
that
he
could
not
be
questioned
but
he
had
told
his
mistress
plainly
that
the
story
in
derby
brought
in
by
couriers
was
that
parliament
had
consented
and
had
passed
sentence
on
her
grace
that
her
grace
herself
had
received
the
news
only
the
day
before
but
that
the
warrant
was
not
signed
and
on
what
charge
asked
robin
desperately
mistress
alice
voice
rang
out
proudly
but
he
saw
her
press
the
girl
closer
as
she
spoke
that
she
was
privy
to
the
plot
which
my
my
brother
had
a
hand
in
then
robin
drew
a
breath
and
decided
it
may
be
so
he
said
but
i
do
not
believe
she
was
privy
to
it
i
spoke
with
her
grace
at
chartley
there
was
a
swift
movement
in
the
half
circle
i
spoke
with
her
grace
at
chartley
he
said
i
went
to
her
under
guise
of
a
herbalist
i
heard
her
confession
and
gave
her
communion
and
she
declared
publicly
before
two
witnesses
after
she
had
had
communion
that
she
was
guiltless
robin
was
no
but
for
half
an
hour
he
was
forced
to
become
one
until
his
hearers
were
satisfied
even
here
in
the
distant
hills
mary
name
was
a
key
to
a
of
mysteries
it
was
through
this
country
too
that
she
had
passed
again
and
again
it
was
at
old
chatsworth
the
square
house
with
the
huge
italian
and
dutch
gardens
that
a
cavendish
had
bought
thirty
years
ago
from
the
agards
that
she
had
passed
part
of
her
captivity
it
was
in
derby
that
she
had
halted
for
a
night
last
year
it
was
near
burton
that
she
had
slept
two
months
ago
on
her
road
to
fotheringay
and
to
hear
now
of
her
from
one
who
had
spoken
to
her
that
very
autumn
was
as
a
revelation
so
robin
told
it
as
well
as
he
could
and
it
may
be
he
said
that
i
shall
have
to
go
again
bourgoign
said
that
he
would
send
to
me
if
he
could
but
i
have
heard
no
word
from
him
he
glanced
round
the
watching
faces
and
i
need
not
say
that
i
shall
hear
no
word
at
all
if
the
tale
i
have
told
you
leak
out
perhaps
she
hath
a
chaplain
again
said
john
after
pause
i
do
not
think
so
said
the
priest
if
she
had
none
at
chartley
she
would
all
the
less
have
one
at
fotheringay
and
it
may
be
you
will
be
sent
for
again
asked
marjorie
voice
gently
from
the
darkness
it
may
be
so
said
the
priest
the
letter
is
to
be
sent
here
she
asked
i
told
bourgoign
so
does
any
other
know
you
are
here
no
mistress
marjorie
there
was
a
pause
it
is
growing
late
said
john
will
your
reverence
go
upstairs
with
me
and
these
ladies
will
come
after
i
think
iii
if
it
had
been
a
great
day
for
robin
that
he
should
come
back
to
his
own
country
after
six
years
and
be
received
in
this
house
of
strange
memories
that
he
should
sit
upstairs
as
a
priest
and
hear
confessions
in
that
very
parlour
where
nearly
seven
years
ago
he
had
sat
with
marjorie
as
her
accepted
lover
if
all
this
had
been
charged
to
him
with
emotions
and
memories
which
however
he
had
outgrown
them
yet
echoed
somewhere
wonderfully
in
his
mind
it
was
no
less
a
kind
of
climax
and
consummation
to
the
girl
whose
house
this
was
and
who
had
waited
so
long
to
receive
back
a
lover
who
came
now
in
so
different
a
guise
but
it
must
be
made
plain
that
to
neither
of
them
was
there
a
thought
or
a
memory
that
ought
not
to
be
to
those
who
hold
that
men
are
no
better
except
for
their
brains
than
other
animals
that
they
are
but
after
all
bundles
of
sense
from
which
all
love
and
aspiration
take
their
rise
to
such
the
thing
will
seem
simply
false
they
will
say
that
it
was
not
so
that
all
that
strange
yearning
that
marjorie
had
to
see
the
man
back
again
that
the
excitement
that
beat
in
robin
heart
as
he
had
ridden
up
the
slope
all
in
the
dark
and
had
seen
the
lighted
windows
at
the
top
that
these
were
but
the
old
loves
in
the
disguise
of
piety
but
to
those
who
understand
what
priesthood
is
for
him
that
receives
it
and
for
the
soul
that
reverences
it
the
thing
is
a
truism
for
the
priest
was
one
who
loved
christ
more
than
all
the
world
and
the
woman
one
who
loved
priesthood
more
than
herself
yet
her
memories
of
him
that
remained
in
her
had
of
course
a
place
in
her
heart
and
though
she
knelt
before
him
presently
in
the
little
parlour
where
once
he
had
kneeled
before
her
as
simply
as
a
child
before
her
father
and
told
her
sins
and
received
christ
pardon
and
went
away
to
make
room
for
the
next
though
all
this
was
without
a
reproach
in
her
eyes
yet
as
she
went
she
knew
that
she
must
face
a
fresh
struggle
and
a
temptation
that
would
not
have
been
so
fierce
if
it
had
been
some
other
priest
that
was
in
peril
that
peril
was
fotheringay
where
as
she
knew
well
enough
every
strange
face
would
be
scrutinized
as
perhaps
nowhere
else
in
all
england
and
that
temptation
lay
in
the
knowledge
that
when
that
letter
should
come
as
she
knew
in
her
heart
it
would
come
it
would
be
through
her
hands
that
it
would
pass
if
it
passed
indeed
while
the
others
went
to
the
priest
one
by
one
marjorie
kneeled
in
her
room
fighting
with
a
devil
that
was
not
yet
come
to
her
as
is
the
way
with
sensitive
consciences
chapter
vi
i
the
suspense
at
fotheringay
grew
deeper
with
every
day
that
passed
christmas
was
come
and
gone
and
no
sign
was
made
from
london
so
far
at
least
as
the
little
town
was
concerned
there
came
almost
daily
from
the
castle
new
tales
of
slights
put
upon
the
queen
and
now
and
again
of
new
favours
granted
to
her
her
chaplain
withdrawn
for
a
while
had
been
admitted
to
her
again
a
week
before
christmas
a
crowd
had
collected
to
see
the
popish
priest
ride
in
and
had
remarked
on
his
timorous
air
and
about
the
same
time
a
courier
had
been
watched
as
he
rode
off
to
london
bearing
it
was
rumoured
one
last
appeal
from
one
queen
to
the
other
on
the
other
hand
it
was
known
that
mary
no
longer
had
her
daïs
in
her
chamber
and
that
the
which
she
never
used
had
been
taken
away
again
but
all
this
had
happened
before
christmas
and
now
a
month
had
gone
by
and
although
this
or
that
tale
of
discourtesy
from
gaoler
to
prisoner
leaked
out
through
the
servants
though
it
was
known
that
the
crucifix
which
mary
had
hung
up
in
the
place
where
her
daïs
had
stood
remained
undisturbed
though
this
argument
or
the
other
could
be
advanced
in
turn
by
men
sitting
over
their
wine
in
the
taverns
that
the
queen
cause
was
rising
or
falling
nothing
was
truly
known
the
one
way
or
the
other
it
had
been
proclaimed
by
trumpet
in
every
town
in
england
that
sentence
of
death
was
passed
yet
this
was
two
or
three
months
ago
and
the
knowledge
that
the
warrant
had
not
yet
been
signed
seemed
an
argument
to
some
that
now
it
never
would
be
a
group
was
waiting
as
a
group
usually
did
wait
at
the
village
entrance
to
the
new
bridge
lately
built
by
her
grace
of
england
towards
sunset
on
an
evening
late
in
january
this
situation
commanded
so
far
as
was
possible
every
point
of
interest
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
london
road
up
which
so
many
couriers
had
passed
it
was
over
this
bridge
that
her
grace
of
scotland
herself
had
come
from
her
journey
from
chartley
on
the
left
looking
northwards
rose
the
great
old
collegiate
church
with
its
graceful
lantern
tower
above
the
low
thatched
stone
houses
of
the
village
on
the
right
adjoining
the
village
beyond
the
big
inn
rose
the
huge
keep
of
the
castle
and
its
walls
within
its
double
moats
ranged
in
form
of
a
fetterlock
of
which
the
river
itself
was
its
straight
side
beyond
the
low
rolling
hills
and
meadows
met
the
chilly
january
sky
for
four
months
now
the
village
had
been
transformed
into
a
kind
of
camp
the
castle
itself
was
crammed
to
bursting
the
row
of
little
windows
beside
the
hall
on
the
first
floor
visible
only
from
the
road
that
led
past
the
inn
parallel
to
the
river
marked
the
lodgings
of
the
queen
where
with
the
hall
also
for
her
use
she
lived
continually
the
rest
of
the
castle
was
full
of
officers
great
lords
who
came
and
went
these
with
the
castellan
rooms
and
those
of
his
people
sir
amyas
lodgings
and
the
space
occupied
by
mary
own
servants
all
these
filled
the
castle
entirely
for
the
rest
the
garrison
not
on
duty
the
grooms
the
couriers
the
lesser
servants
the
suites
of
the
visitors
and
even
many
of
the
visitors
themselves
these
filled
the
two
inns
of
the
little
town
completely
and
overflowed
everywhere
into
the
houses
of
the
people
it
was
a
vision
of
a
garrison
in
that
the
countryfolk
gaped
at
continually
the
street
sparkled
all
day
with
liveries
and
arms
archers
went
to
and
fro
the
trample
of
horses
the
sharp
military
orders
at
the
changings
of
guard
outside
and
within
the
towered
gateway
that
commanded
the
entrance
over
the
moats
the
songs
of
men
over
their
wine
in
the
these
things
had
become
matters
of
common
observation
and
fired
many
a
young
with
a
zeal
for
arms
the
queen
herself
was
a
mystery
they
had
seen
for
a
moment
as
she
drove
in
after
dark
last
september
a
coach
in
which
it
was
said
she
had
sat
with
her
back
to
the
horses
surrounded
by
guards
patient
watchers
had
perhaps
half
a
dozen
times
altogether
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
woman
face
at
a
window
that
was
supposed
to
be
hers
look
out
for
an
instant
over
the
wall
that
skirted
the
moat
but
that
was
all
they
heard
the
trumpets
cry
within
the
castle
and
even
learned
to
distinguish
something
of
what
each
signified
the
call
for
the
changing
of
guards
the
announcement
of
dinner
and
supper
the
warning
to
the
gatekeepers
that
persons
were
to
pass
out
but
of
her
round
whom
all
this
centred
of
the
of
this
hive
of
angry
bees
they
knew
less
than
of
her
grace
of
england
whom
once
they
had
seen
ride
in
through
these
very
gates
tales
of
course
were
abundant
gossip
from
servant
to
servant
filtering
down
at
last
distorted
or
attenuated
to
the
rustics
who
watched
and
exclaimed
but
there
was
not
a
soldier
who
kept
her
not
a
cook
who
served
her
of
whom
they
did
not
know
more
than
of
herself
there
were
even
parties
in
the
village
or
rather
there
was
a
silent
group
who
did
not
join
in
the
universal
disapproval
but
these
were
queer
and
fantastic
persons
who
still
held
to
the
old
ways
and
would
not
go
to
church
with
the
rest
a
little
more
material
had
been
supplied
for
conversation
by
the
events
of
it
had
positively
been
reported
by
a
fellow
who
had
been
to
see
about
a
room
for
himself
in
the
village
that
he
had
been
turned
out
of
the
castle
to
make
space
for
her
grace
chaplain
this
was
puzzling
had
not
the
popish
priest
already
been
in
the
castle
five
or
six
weeks
then
why
should
he
now
require
another
chamber
the
argument
waxed
hot
by
the
bridge
one
said
that
it
was
another
priest
that
was
come
in
disguise
another
that
once
a
popish
priest
got
a
foothold
in
a
place
he
was
never
content
till
he
got
the
whole
for
himself
a
third
that
the
fellow
had
simply
lied
and
that
he
was
turned
out
because
he
had
been
caught
by
sir
amyas
making
love
to
one
of
the
maids
each
was
positive
of
his
own
thesis
and
argued
for
it
by
the
process
of
that
it
was
so
and
that
his
opponents
were
fools
they
spat
into
the
water
one
got
out
a
tobacco
pipe
that
a
soldier
had
given
him
and
made
a
great
show
of
filling
it
though
he
had
no
flint
to
light
it
with
another
proclaimed
that
for
two
figs
he
would
go
and
inquire
at
the
gateway
itself
to
this
barren
war
of
the
schools
came
a
fact
at
last
and
its
bearer
was
a
gorgeous
figure
of
a
who
later
got
into
trouble
by
talking
too
much
who
came
swaggering
down
the
road
from
the
new
inn
blowing
smoke
into
the
air
with
his
hat
on
one
side
and
his
loose
and
declared
in
that
strange
clipped
of
his
that
he
had
been
on
guard
at
the
door
of
sir
amyas
room
and
had
heard
him
tell
melville
the
steward
and
de
préau
the
priest
that
they
must
no
longer
have
access
to
her
grace
but
must
move
their
lodgings
elsewhere
within
the
castle
this
then
had
to
be
discussed
once
more
from
the
beginning
one
said
that
this
was
an
evident
sign
that
the
end
was
to
come
and
that
madam
was
to
die
another
that
on
the
contrary
it
was
plain
that
this
was
not
so
but
that
rather
she
was
to
be
compelled
by
greater
strictness
to
acknowledge
her
guilt
a
third
that
it
was
none
of
these
things
but
rather
that
madam
was
turning
protestant
at
last
in
order
to
save
her
life
and
had
devised
this
manner
of
ridding
herself
of
the
priest
and
the
soldier
damned
them
all
round
as
who
knew
nothing
and
talked
all
the
more
for
it
the
dark
was
beginning
to
fall
before
the
group
broke
up
and
none
of
them
took
much
notice
of
a
young
man
on
a
fresh
horse
who
rode
quietly
out
of
the
yard
of
the
new
inn
as
the
saunterers
came
up
one
of
them
three
minutes
later
however
heard
suddenly
from
across
the
bridge
the
sound
of
a
horse
breaking
into
a
gallop
and
presently
dying
away
westwards
beyond
perry
lane
ii
within
the
castle
that
evening
nothing
happened
that
was
of
any
note
to
its
more
careless
occupants
all
was
as
usual
the
guard
at
the
towers
that
controlled
the
drawbridge
across
the
outer
moat
was
changed
at
four
six
men
came
out
under
an
officer
from
the
inner
court
the
words
were
exchanged
and
the
six
that
went
off
duty
marched
into
the
armoury
to
lay
by
their
pikes
and
presently
dispersed
four
to
their
rooms
in
the
east
side
of
the
quadrangle
two
to
their
quarters
in
the
village
from
the
kitchen
came
the
clash
of
dishes
sir
amyas
came
out
from
the
direction
of
the
keep
where
he
had
been
conferring
with
fitzwilliam
the
castellan
and
passed
across
to
his
lodging
on
the
south
a
butcher
hurried
in
under
escort
of
a
couple
of
men
from
the
gate
with
a
covered
basket
and
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
entry
all
these
things
were
observed
idly
by
the
dozen
guards
who
stood
two
at
each
of
the
five
doors
that
gave
upon
the
courtyard
presently
too
hardly
ten
minutes
after
the
guard
was
changed
three
figures
came
out
at
the
staircase
foot
where
sir
amyas
had
just
gone
in
and
stood
there
apparently
talking
in
low
voices
then
one
of
them
melville
the
queen
steward
came
across
the
court
with
bourgoign
towards
the
outer
entrance
passed
under
it
and
presently
bourgoign
came
back
and
wheeled
sharply
in
to
the
right
by
the
entry
that
led
up
to
the
queen
lodging
meanwhile
the
third
figure
whom
one
of
the
men
had
thought
to
be
de
préau
had
gone
back
again
towards
melville
rooms
that
was
all
that
was
to
be
seen
until
half
an
hour
later
a
few
minutes
before
the
drawbridge
was
raised
for
the
night
the
steward
came
back
crossed
the
court
once
more
and
vanished
into
the
entry
opposite
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
young
man
had
ridden
out
from
the
new
inn
then
the
sun
went
down
the
flambeaux
were
lighted
beneath
the
two
great
entrances
in
the
towered
archway
across
the
moat
and
the
smaller
vaulted
archway
within
as
well
as
one
more
flambeau
stuck
into
the
iron
ring
by
each
of
the
four
more
and
lights
began
to
burn
in
the
windows
round
about
the
man
at
sir
amyas
staircase
looked
across
the
court
and
idly
wondered
what
was
passing
in
the
rooms
opposite
on
the
first
floor
where
the
queen
was
lodged
he
had
heard
that
the
priest
had
been
forced
to
change
his
room
and
was
to
sleep
in
for
the
present
so
her
grace
would
have
to
get
on
without
him
as
well
as
she
could
there
would
be
no
popish
mass
then
in
the
oratory
that
he
had
heard
was
made
upstairs
he
marvelled
at
the
superstition
that
made
this
a
burden
at
a
quarter
before
six
a
trumpet
blew
and
presently
the
tall
windows
of
the
hall
across
the
court
from
him
began
to
kindle
that
was
for
her
grace
supper
to
be
served
at
five
minutes
to
six
another
trumpet
sounded
and
landet
the
queen
butler
hurried
out
with
his
white
rod
to
take
his
place
for
the
entrance
of
the
dishes
finally
through
the
window
at
the
foot
of
the
queen
stair
the
man
caught
a
glimpse
of
moving
figures
passing
towards
the
hall
that
would
be
her
grace
going
in
state
to
her
supper
with
her
women
but
for
the
first
time
without
either
priest
to
say
grace
or
steward
to
escort
her
he
saw
too
the
couple
of
guards
under
the
inner
archway
come
to
the
salute
as
the
little
procession
came
for
an
instant
within
their
view
and
newrins
the
butler
of
the
castle
stop
suddenly
and
pull
off
his
cap
as
he
was
hurrying
in
to
be
in
time
for
the
supper
of
the
gentlemen
that
was
served
in
the
keep
half
an
hour
after
the
queen
meanwhile
ten
miles
away
along
the
uppingham
and
leicester
track
rode
a
young
man
through
the
dark
iii
sunday
too
passed
as
usual
at
eight
the
bells
of
the
church
pealed
out
for
the
morning
service
and
the
village
street
was
thronged
with
worshippers
and
a
few
soldiers
at
nine
they
ceased
and
the
street
was
empty
at
eleven
the
trumpets
sounded
to
announce
change
of
guard
and
to
tell
the
kitchen
folk
that
was
come
half
an
hour
later
once
more
the
little
procession
glinted
a
moment
through
the
window
of
the
queen
stair
as
her
grace
went
to
dinner
she
was
not
very
well
the
cooks
had
reported
and
had
eaten
but
little
last
night
at
twelve
she
came
out
again
and
went
upstairs
and
at
the
same
time
in
leicester
a
young
man
splashed
from
head
to
foot
slipped
off
a
draggled
and
exhausted
horse
and
went
into
an
inn
ordering
a
fresh
horse
to
be
ready
for
him
at
three
and
so
once
more
the
sun
went
down
and
the
little
rituals
were
performed
and
the
guards
were
changed
and
landet
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
though
he
did
not
know
it
came
out
from
the
kitchen
with
his
white
rod
to
bear
it
before
the
dishes
of
a
queen
and
sir
amyas
walked
in
from
the
orchard
and
was
saluted
and
fitzwilliam
went
his
rounds
and
the
drawbridge
was
raised
and
at
the
time
that
the
drawbridge
was
raised
a
young
man
on
a
horse
was
wondering
when
he
should
see
the
lights
of
burton
iv
the
first
that
mistress
manners
knew
of
his
coming
in
the
early
hours
of
monday
morning
was
when
she
was
awakened
by
janet
in
the
pitch
darkness
shaking
her
shoulder
it
is
a
young
man
she
said
on
foot
his
horse
fell
five
miles
off
he
is
come
with
a
letter
from
derby
sleep
fell
from
marjorie
like
a
cloak
this
kind
of
thing
had
happened
to
her
before
now
and
then
such
a
letter
would
come
from
a
priest
who
lacked
money
or
desired
a
guide
or
information
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
began
to
put
on
her
outer
dress
and
her
hooded
cloak
as
the
night
was
cold
bring
him
into
the
hall
she
said
get
beer
and
some
food
and
blow
the
fire
up
janet
vanished
when
the
mistress
came
down
five
minutes
later
all
had
been
done
as
she
had
ordered
the
turf
and
wood
fire
leaped
in
the
chimney
a
young
man
still
with
his
hat
on
his
head
and
drawn
down
a
little
over
his
face
was
sitting
over
the
hearth
steaming
like
a
kettle
eating
voraciously
janet
was
waiting
discreetly
by
the
doors
marjorie
nodded
to
her
and
she
went
out
she
had
learned
that
her
mistress
secrets
were
not
always
her
own
as
well
i
am
mistress
manners
she
said
you
have
a
letter
for
me
the
young
man
stood
up
i
know
you
well
enough
mistress
he
said
i
am
john
merton
son
marjorie
heart
leaped
with
relief
in
spite
of
her
determination
that
this
must
be
a
letter
from
a
priest
there
had
still
thrust
itself
before
her
mind
the
possibility
that
it
might
be
that
other
letter
whose
coming
she
had
feared
she
had
told
herself
fiercely
as
she
came
downstairs
just
now
that
it
could
not
be
no
news
was
come
from
fotheringay
all
the
winter
it
was
common
knowledge
that
her
grace
had
a
priest
of
her
own
and
now
that
this
was
john
merton
son
she
smiled
give
me
the
letter
she
said
i
should
have
known
you
too
if
it
were
not
for
the
dark
well
mistress
he
said
the
letter
was
to
be
delivered
to
you
melville
said
but
who
melville
mistress
her
grace
steward
at
fotheringay
he
talked
on
a
moment
or
two
beginning
to
say
that
melville
himself
had
come
out
to
the
inn
that
he
as
melville
own
servant
had
been
lodging
there
and
had
been
bidden
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
since
he
knew
derbyshire
but
she
was
not
listening
she
only
knew
that
that
had
fallen
which
she
feared
give
me
the
letter
she
said
again
he
sat
down
excusing
himself
and
fumbled
with
his
boot
and
by
the
time
that
he
held
it
out
to
her
she
was
in
the
thick
of
the
conflict
she
knew
well
enough
what
it
meant
that
there
was
no
peril
in
all
england
like
that
to
which
this
letter
called
her
friend
there
waiting
for
him
in
fotheringay
where
every
strange
face
was
suspected
where
a
popish
priest
was
as
a
sheep
in
a
den
of
wolves
where
there
would
be
no
mercy
at
all
if
he
were
discovered
and
where
if
he
were
to
be
of
use
at
all
he
must
adventure
himself
in
the
very
spot
where
he
would
be
most
suspected
on
a
task
that
would
be
thought
the
last
word
in
treason
and
disobedience
and
worst
of
all
this
priest
had
lodged
in
the
tavern
where
the
conspirators
had
lodged
he
had
talked
with
them
the
night
before
their
flight
and
now
here
he
was
striving
to
get
access
to
her
for
whom
all
had
been
designed
was
there
a
soul
in
england
that
could
doubt
his
complicity
and
it
was
to
her
own
house
here
in
derbyshire
that
he
had
come
for
shelter
it
was
here
that
he
had
said
mass
yesterday
and
it
must
be
from
this
house
that
he
must
ride
on
one
of
her
horses
and
it
must
be
her
hand
that
gave
him
the
summons
last
of
all
it
was
she
marjorie
manners
that
had
sent
him
to
this
life
six
years
ago
then
as
she
took
the
letter
the
shrewd
woman
in
her
spoke
it
was
irresistible
and
she
seemed
to
listen
to
voice
that
was
not
hers
does
any
here
know
that
you
are
come
no
mistress
if
i
bade
you
and
said
that
i
had
reasons
for
it
you
would
ride
away
again
alone
without
a
word
to
any
why
yes
mistress
oh
the
plan
was
irresistible
and
complete
she
would
send
this
messenger
away
again
on
one
of
her
own
horses
as
far
as
derby
he
could
leave
the
horse
there
and
she
would
send
a
man
for
it
he
would
go
back
to
fotheringay
and
would
wait
he
and
those
that
had
sent
him
and
the
priest
they
expected
would
not
come
he
too
himself
had
ceased
to
expect
any
word
from
bourgoign
he
had
said
a
month
ago
that
surely
none
would
come
now
he
had
been
away
from
booth
edge
in
fact
for
nearly
a
month
and
had
scarcely
even
asked
on
his
return
last
saturday
to
padley
whether
any
message
had
come
why
it
was
complete
complete
and
irresistible
she
would
burn
the
letter
here
in
this
when
the
man
was
gone
again
and
say
to
janet
that
the
letter
had
been
from
a
travelling
priest
that
was
in
trouble
and
that
she
had
sent
the
answer
and
robin
would
presently
cease
to
look
for
news
and
the
end
would
come
and
there
would
be
no
more
trouble
do
you
know
what
is
in
the
letter
she
whispered
sharply
sit
down
again
and
go
on
eating
he
obeyed
her
yes
mistress
he
said
the
priest
was
taken
from
her
on
saturday
bourgoign
had
arranged
all
in
readiness
for
that
you
said
mr
melville
melville
is
a
protestant
mistress
but
he
is
very
well
devoted
to
her
grace
and
has
done
as
bourgoign
wished
why
must
her
grace
have
a
priest
at
once
surely
for
a
few
days
he
glanced
up
at
her
and
she
conscious
of
her
own
falseness
thought
he
looked
astonished
i
mean
that
they
will
surely
give
her
her
priest
back
again
presently
and
her
voice
faltered
and
alban
is
spent
with
his
travelling
they
mean
to
kill
her
mistress
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
amongst
those
of
us
that
are
catholics
and
it
is
that
she
may
have
a
priest
before
she
dies
that
he
paused
yes
she
said
her
grace
had
a
fit
of
crying
it
is
said
when
her
priest
was
taken
from
her
melville
was
crying
himself
even
though
he
stopped
himself
plainly
affected
then
in
a
great
surge
her
own
heart
rose
up
and
she
understood
what
she
was
doing
as
in
a
vision
she
saw
her
own
mother
crying
out
for
the
priest
that
never
came
and
she
understood
that
horror
of
darkness
that
falls
on
one
who
knowing
what
the
priest
can
do
knowing
the
infinite
consolations
which
christ
gives
is
deprived
when
physical
death
approaches
of
that
tremendous
strength
and
comfort
indeed
she
recognised
to
the
full
that
when
a
priest
can
not
be
had
god
will
save
and
forgive
without
him
yet
what
would
be
the
heartlessness
to
say
nothing
of
the
guilt
of
one
that
would
keep
him
away
for
what
except
that
this
strength
and
comfort
might
be
at
the
service
of
flock
had
her
own
life
been
spent
it
was
expressly
for
this
that
she
had
lived
on
in
england
when
peace
and
the
cloister
might
be
hers
elsewhere
and
now
that
her
own
life
was
touched
should
she
fail
the
blindness
passed
like
a
dream
and
her
soul
rose
up
again
on
a
wave
of
pain
and
exaltation
wait
she
said
i
will
go
and
awaken
him
and
bid
him
come
down
v
an
hour
later
as
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
slit
the
sky
to
the
eastwards
over
the
moors
she
stood
with
janet
and
mistress
alice
and
robin
by
the
hall
fire
she
had
said
not
a
word
to
any
of
the
struggle
she
had
passed
through
she
had
gone
upstairs
resolutely
and
knocked
on
his
door
till
he
had
answered
and
then
whispered
the
letter
is
come
i
will
have
food
ready
slipping
the
letter
beneath
the
door
then
she
had
sent
janet
to
awaken
a
couple
of
men
that
slept
over
the
stables
and
bid
them
saddle
two
horses
at
once
and
herself
had
gone
to
the
buttery
to
make
ready
a
meal
then
mistress
alice
had
awakened
and
come
downstairs
and
the
three
women
had
waited
on
the
priest
as
in
boots
and
cloak
he
had
taken
some
food
then
as
the
sound
of
the
horses
feet
coming
round
from
the
stables
at
the
back
had
reached
them
she
had
determined
to
tell
robin
before
he
went
of
how
she
had
played
the
coward
she
went
out
with
him
to
the
entry
between
the
hall
and
the
buttery
holding
the
others
back
with
a
glance
i
near
destroyed
the
letter
she
said
simply
with
downcast
eyes
and
sent
the
man
away
again
i
was
afraid
of
what
might
fall
at
fotheringay
may
christ
protect
you
she
said
no
more
than
that
but
turned
and
called
the
others
before
he
could
speak
as
he
gathered
up
the
reins
a
moment
later
before
mounting
the
three
women
kneeled
down
in
the
lighted
entry
and
the
two
by
the
horses
heads
and
the
priest
gave
them
his
blessing
chapter
vii
i
it
was
not
until
after
dawn
on
wednesday
the
of
january
as
the
bells
were
ringing
in
the
parish
church
for
the
conversion
of
paul
that
the
two
draggled
travellers
rode
in
over
the
bridge
of
fotheringay
seeing
the
rise
grim
and
grey
out
of
the
on
the
right
and
passing
on
dismounted
in
the
yard
of
the
new
inn
they
had
had
one
or
two
small
misadventures
by
the
way
and
young
merton
through
sheer
sleepiness
had
so
reeled
in
his
saddle
on
the
afternoon
of
monday
that
the
priest
had
insisted
that
they
should
both
have
at
least
one
good
night
rest
but
they
had
ridden
all
tuesday
night
without
drawing
rein
and
robin
going
up
to
the
room
that
he
was
to
share
with
the
young
man
fell
upon
the
bed
and
asleep
all
in
one
act
he
was
awakened
by
the
trumpets
sounding
for
dinner
in
the
and
sat
up
to
find
young
john
looking
at
him
the
news
that
he
brought
drove
the
last
shreds
of
sleep
from
his
brain
i
have
seen
melville
my
master
sir
he
bids
me
say
it
is
useless
for
bourgoign
or
anyone
else
to
attempt
anything
with
sir
amyas
for
the
present
melville
hath
spoken
to
sir
amyas
as
to
his
separation
from
her
grace
and
could
get
no
reason
for
it
but
the
same
day
it
was
of
monday
her
grace
butler
was
forbidden
any
more
to
carry
the
white
rod
before
her
dishes
this
is
as
much
as
to
signify
melville
says
that
her
grace
royalty
shall
no
longer
protect
her
it
is
their
intention
he
says
to
degrade
her
first
before
they
execute
her
and
we
may
look
for
the
warrant
any
day
my
master
says
the
young
man
stared
at
him
mournfully
and
de
préau
de
préau
goes
about
as
a
ghost
he
will
come
and
speak
with
your
reverence
before
the
day
is
out
meanwhile
melville
says
you
may
walk
abroad
freely
sir
amyas
never
goes
forth
of
the
castle
now
and
none
will
notice
but
they
might
take
notice
melville
says
if
you
were
to
lie
all
day
in
your
chamber
it
was
after
dinner
as
robin
rose
from
the
table
in
a
parlour
where
he
had
dined
with
two
or
three
lawyers
and
an
officer
of
fitzwilliam
that
john
merton
came
to
him
and
told
him
that
a
gentleman
was
waiting
he
went
upstairs
and
found
the
priest
a
little
man
dressed
like
a
minister
pacing
quickly
to
and
fro
in
the
tiny
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
where
john
and
he
were
to
sleep
the
frenchman
seized
his
two
hands
and
began
to
pour
out
in
an
agitated
whisper
a
torrent
of
french
and
english
robin
disengaged
himself
you
must
sit
down
de
préau
he
said
and
speak
slowly
or
i
shall
not
understand
one
word
tell
me
precisely
what
i
must
do
i
am
here
to
obey
orders
no
more
i
have
no
design
in
my
head
at
all
i
will
do
what
bourgoign
and
yourself
decide
it
was
pathetic
to
watch
the
little
priest
he
interrupted
himself
by
a
thousand
apostrophes
he
lifted
hands
and
eyes
to
the
ceiling
repeatedly
he
named
his
poor
mistress
saint
and
martyr
he
cried
out
against
the
barbarian
land
in
which
he
found
himself
and
the
bloodthirsty
tigers
with
whom
like
a
second
daniel
he
himself
had
to
consort
he
expatiated
on
the
horrible
risk
that
he
ran
in
venturing
forth
from
the
castle
on
such
an
errand
saying
that
sir
amyas
would
wring
his
neck
like
a
hen
if
he
so
much
as
suspected
the
nature
of
his
business
he
denounced
with
feeble
venom
the
wickedness
of
these
murderers
who
would
not
only
slay
his
mistress
body
but
her
soul
as
well
if
they
could
by
depriving
her
of
a
priest
incidentally
however
he
disclosed
that
at
present
there
was
no
plan
at
all
for
robin
admission
bourgoign
had
sent
for
him
hoping
that
he
might
be
able
to
reintroduce
him
once
more
on
the
same
pretext
as
at
chartley
but
the
incident
of
monday
when
the
white
rod
had
been
forbidden
and
the
conversation
of
sir
amyas
to
melville
had
made
it
evident
that
an
attempt
at
present
would
be
worse
than
useless
you
must
yourself
choose
he
cried
with
an
abominable
accent
if
you
will
imperil
your
life
by
remaining
our
lord
will
no
doubt
reward
you
in
eternity
but
if
not
and
you
flee
not
a
man
will
blame
you
least
of
all
myself
who
would
no
doubt
flee
too
if
i
but
dared
this
was
frank
and
humble
at
any
rate
robin
smiled
i
will
remain
he
said
the
frenchman
seized
his
hands
and
kissed
them
you
are
a
hero
and
a
martyr
monsieur
we
will
perish
together
therefore
ii
after
the
frenchman
departure
and
an
hour
sleep
in
that
profundity
of
unconsciousness
that
follows
prolonged
effort
robin
put
on
his
sword
and
hat
and
cloak
having
dressed
himself
with
care
and
went
slowly
out
of
the
inn
to
inspect
the
battlefield
he
carried
himself
deliberately
with
a
kind
of
assured
insolence
as
if
he
had
supreme
rights
in
this
place
and
were
one
of
that
crowd
of
persons
great
lords
lawyers
agents
of
the
court
to
whom
for
the
last
few
months
fotheringay
had
become
accustomed
he
turned
first
to
the
right
towards
the
castle
and
presently
was
passing
down
its
long
length
it
looked
indeed
a
royal
prison
a
low
wall
on
his
right
protected
the
road
from
the
huge
outer
moat
that
ran
in
the
shape
of
a
fetterlock
completely
round
all
the
buildings
and
beyond
it
springing
immediately
from
the
edge
of
the
water
rose
the
massive
outer
wall
pierced
here
and
there
with
windows
he
thought
that
he
could
make
out
the
tops
of
the
hall
windows
in
one
place
beyond
the
skirting
wall
the
pinnacles
of
the
chapel
in
another
and
a
row
of
further
windows
that
might
be
lodgings
in
a
third
but
from
without
here
nothing
was
certain
except
the
gigantic
keep
that
stood
high
to
the
west
and
the
strong
towers
that
guarded
the
drawbridge
this
as
he
went
by
was
lowered
to
its
place
and
he
could
look
across
it
into
the
archway
where
four
men
stood
on
guard
with
their
pikes
the
inner
doors
however
were
closed
beyond
them
and
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
inner
moat
that
surrounded
the
court
nor
the
yard
itself
neither
did
he
think
it
prudent
to
ask
any
questions
though
he
looked
freely
about
him
since
the
part
he
must
play
for
the
present
plainly
was
that
of
one
who
had
a
right
here
and
knew
what
he
did
he
came
back
to
the
inn
an
hour
later
after
a
walk
through
the
village
and
round
the
locked
church
this
was
a
splendid
building
with
flying
buttresses
and
a
high
tower
with
exterior
carvings
of
saints
and
evangelists
all
in
place
but
it
looked
desolate
to
him
and
he
was
the
more
dejected
as
he
seemed
no
nearer
to
the
queen
than
before
and
with
little
chance
of
getting
there
meanwhile
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
and
that
the
hardest
of
all
to
wait
perhaps
in
a
few
days
he
might
get
speech
with
bourgoign
yet
for
the
present
that
too
as
the
priest
had
told
him
was
out
of
the
question
iii
five
days
were
gone
by
sunday
had
come
and
gone
and
yet
there
had
been
no
news
except
a
letter
conveyed
to
him
by
merton
written
by
bourgoign
himself
telling
him
that
he
had
news
that
beale
the
clerk
of
the
council
was
to
arrive
some
time
that
week
and
that
this
presaged
the
approach
of
the
end
he
would
therefore
do
his
utmost
within
the
next
few
days
to
approach
sir
amyas
and
ask
for
the
admission
of
the
young
herbalist
who
had
done
her
grace
so
much
good
at
chartley
he
added
that
if
any
question
were
to
be
raised
as
to
why
he
had
been
so
long
in
the
place
and
why
indeed
he
had
come
at
all
he
was
to
answer
fearlessly
that
bourgoign
had
sent
for
him
on
the
sunday
night
robin
could
not
sleep
little
by
little
the
hideous
suspense
was
acting
upon
him
and
the
knowledge
that
not
a
hundred
yards
away
from
him
the
wonderful
woman
whom
he
had
seen
at
chartley
the
loving
and
humble
catholic
who
had
kneeled
so
ardently
before
her
lord
the
queen
who
had
received
from
him
the
sacraments
for
which
she
thirsted
the
knowledge
that
she
was
breaking
her
heart
so
near
for
the
consolation
which
a
priest
only
could
give
and
that
he
a
priest
was
free
to
go
through
all
england
except
through
that
towered
gateway
past
which
he
walked
every
day
this
increased
his
misery
and
his
longing
the
very
day
he
had
been
through
the
sunday
on
which
he
could
neither
say
nor
even
hear
mass
for
because
of
the
greatness
of
that
which
was
at
stake
he
had
thought
it
wiser
to
bring
with
him
nothing
that
could
arouse
suspicion
and
the
hearing
of
the
bells
from
the
church
calling
to
protestant
prayers
and
the
sight
of
the
crowds
going
and
returning
this
brought
him
lower
than
he
had
been
since
his
first
coming
to
england
he
lay
then
in
the
darkness
turning
from
side
to
side
thinking
of
these
things
listening
to
the
breathing
of
the
young
man
who
lay
on
blankets
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
about
midnight
he
could
lie
there
no
longer
he
got
out
of
bed
noiselessly
stepped
across
the
other
went
to
the
and
sat
down
there
staring
out
with
eyes
well
accustomed
to
the
darkness
towards
the
vast
outline
against
the
sky
which
he
knew
was
the
keep
of
the
castle
no
light
burned
there
to
relieve
its
brutality
it
remained
there
implacable
as
english
justice
immovable
as
the
heart
of
elizabeth
and
the
composure
of
the
gaoler
who
kept
it
then
he
drew
out
maine
rosary
and
began
to
recite
the
sorrowful
he
supposed
afterwards
that
he
had
begun
to
doze
but
he
started
at
a
sudden
glare
of
light
in
his
eyes
as
if
a
beacon
had
flared
for
an
instant
somewhere
within
the
castle
enclosure
it
was
gone
again
however
there
remained
the
steady
monstrous
mass
of
building
and
the
heavy
sky
then
as
he
watched
it
came
again
without
warning
and
without
sound
that
same
brilliant
flare
of
light
against
which
the
towers
and
walls
stood
out
a
third
time
it
came
and
all
was
dark
once
more
in
the
morning
as
he
sat
over
his
ale
in
the
tavern
below
he
listened
without
lifting
his
eyes
engrossed
it
seemed
in
a
little
book
he
was
reading
to
the
excited
talk
of
a
group
of
soldiers
one
of
them
he
said
had
been
on
guard
beneath
the
queen
windows
last
night
and
between
midnight
and
one
had
seen
three
times
a
brilliant
light
explode
itself
like
soundless
gunpowder
immediately
over
the
room
where
she
slept
and
this
he
asserted
over
and
over
again
iv
on
the
following
saturday
john
merton
came
up
into
the
room
where
the
priest
was
sleeping
after
dinner
and
awakened
him
if
you
will
come
at
once
with
me
sir
you
can
have
speech
with
bourgoign
my
master
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
so
bourgoign
has
leave
to
go
out
robin
said
nothing
it
was
the
kind
of
opportunity
that
must
not
be
imperilled
by
a
single
word
that
might
be
overheard
he
threw
on
his
great
cloak
buckled
his
sword
on
and
followed
with
every
nerve
awake
they
went
up
the
street
leading
towards
the
church
and
turned
down
a
little
between
two
of
the
larger
houses
the
young
man
pushed
on
a
door
in
the
wall
and
robin
went
through
to
find
himself
in
a
little
enclosed
garden
with
bourgoign
gathering
herbs
from
the
border
not
a
yard
from
him
the
physician
said
nothing
he
glanced
sharply
up
and
pointed
to
a
seat
set
under
the
shelter
of
the
wall
that
hid
the
greater
part
of
the
garden
from
the
house
to
which
it
belonged
and
as
robin
reached
it
bourgoign
still
gathering
his
herbs
began
to
speak
in
an
undertone
do
not
speak
except
very
softly
if
you
must
he
said
the
queen
is
sick
again
and
i
have
leave
to
gather
herbs
for
her
in
two
or
three
gardens
it
was
refused
to
me
at
first
and
then
granted
afterwards
from
that
i
look
for
the
worst
beale
will
come
i
hear
paulet
refused
me
leave
the
first
time
i
make
no
doubt
knowing
that
all
was
to
end
within
a
day
or
two
then
he
granted
it
me
for
fear
i
should
suspect
his
reason
can
you
hear
me
sir
robin
nodded
his
heart
thumped
within
him
well
sir
i
shall
tell
sir
amyas
that
my
herbs
do
no
good
that
i
do
not
know
what
to
give
her
grace
i
have
seen
her
grace
continually
but
with
a
man
in
the
room
always
her
grace
knows
that
you
are
here
and
bids
me
thank
you
with
all
her
heart
i
shall
speak
to
sir
amyas
and
shall
tell
him
that
you
are
here
and
that
i
sent
for
you
but
did
not
dare
to
ask
leave
for
you
until
now
if
he
refuses
i
shall
know
that
all
is
finished
and
that
beale
has
brought
the
warrant
with
him
if
he
consents
i
shall
think
that
it
is
put
off
for
a
little
he
was
very
near
to
robin
now
still
with
a
critical
air
pushing
the
herbs
this
way
and
that
selecting
one
now
and
again
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
sir
do
not
speak
loud
the
fellow
that
conducted
me
from
the
castle
is
drinking
ale
in
the
house
behind
he
did
not
know
of
this
door
on
the
side
have
you
anything
to
say
yes
said
robin
what
is
it
two
things
the
first
is
that
i
think
one
of
the
fellows
in
the
inn
is
doubtful
of
me
merton
tells
me
he
has
asked
a
great
number
of
questions
about
me
what
had
i
best
do
who
is
he
he
is
a
servant
of
my
lord
shrewsbury
who
is
in
the
neighbourhood
the
doctor
was
silent
am
i
in
danger
asked
the
priest
quietly
shall
i
endanger
her
grace
you
can
not
endanger
her
grace
she
is
near
her
end
in
any
case
but
for
yourself
yes
you
are
endangering
yourself
every
instant
by
remaining
said
the
doctor
dryly
the
second
matter
began
robin
but
what
of
yourself
myself
must
be
endangered
said
robin
softly
the
second
matter
is
whether
you
can
not
get
me
near
her
grace
in
the
event
of
her
execution
i
could
at
least
give
her
absolution
bourgoign
shot
a
glance
at
him
which
he
could
not
interpret
sir
he
said
god
will
reward
you
as
regards
the
second
matter
it
will
be
exceedingly
difficult
if
it
is
to
be
in
the
open
court
i
may
perhaps
contrive
it
if
it
is
to
be
in
the
hall
none
but
known
persons
would
be
admitted
have
you
anything
more
sir
no
then
you
had
best
be
gone
again
at
once
her
grace
prays
for
you
she
had
a
fit
of
weeping
last
night
to
know
that
a
priest
was
here
and
she
not
able
to
have
him
do
you
pray
for
her
v
sunday
morning
dawned
the
bells
pealed
out
the
crowds
went
by
the
church
and
came
back
to
dinner
and
yet
no
word
had
come
to
the
inn
robin
scarcely
stirred
out
all
that
day
for
fear
a
summons
should
come
and
he
miss
it
he
feigned
a
little
illness
and
sat
wrapped
up
in
the
corner
window
of
the
parlour
upstairs
whence
he
could
command
both
roads
that
which
led
to
the
castle
and
that
which
led
to
the
bridge
over
which
beale
must
come
he
considered
it
prudent
also
to
do
this
because
of
the
fellow
of
whom
merton
had
told
him
a
man
that
looked
like
a
groom
and
who
was
lent
he
heard
with
one
or
two
others
by
his
master
to
do
service
at
the
castle
robin
own
plan
had
been
distinct
ever
since
de
préau
had
brought
him
the
first
message
he
bore
himself
as
has
been
said
assuredly
and
confidently
and
if
he
were
questioned
would
simply
have
said
that
he
had
business
connected
with
the
castle
this
asserted
in
a
proper
tone
would
probably
have
its
effect
there
was
so
much
mystery
involving
such
personages
from
the
queen
of
england
downwards
that
discretion
was
safer
than
curiosity
it
was
growing
towards
dark
when
robin
after
long
and
fruitless
staring
down
the
castle
road
turned
himself
to
the
other
the
parlour
was
empty
at
this
hour
except
for
himself
he
saw
the
group
gathering
as
usual
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
to
watch
the
arrivals
from
london
who
if
there
were
any
generally
came
about
this
time
then
as
he
looked
he
saw
two
horsemen
mount
the
further
slope
of
the
bridge
and
come
full
into
view
now
there
was
nothing
whatever
about
these
two
persons
in
outward
appearance
to
explain
the
strange
effect
they
had
upon
the
priest
they
could
not
possibly
be
the
party
for
which
he
was
watching
beale
would
certainly
come
with
a
great
company
they
were
besides
plainly
no
more
than
one
wore
some
kind
of
a
livery
the
other
a
man
who
sat
his
horse
awkwardly
was
in
new
clothes
that
did
not
fit
him
they
rode
ordinary
hackneys
and
each
had
luggage
strapped
behind
his
saddle
all
this
the
priest
saw
as
they
came
up
the
narrow
street
and
halted
before
the
inn
door
they
might
perhaps
be
servants
of
beale
yet
that
did
not
seem
probable
as
there
was
no
sign
of
a
following
party
the
landlord
came
out
on
to
the
steps
beneath
and
after
a
word
or
two
they
slipped
off
their
horses
wearily
and
led
them
round
into
the
court
of
the
inn
all
this
was
usual
enough
the
priest
had
seen
such
arrivals
a
dozen
times
at
this
very
door
yet
he
felt
sick
as
he
looked
at
them
there
appeared
to
him
something
terrible
and
sinister
about
them
he
had
seen
the
face
of
the
liveried
servant
but
not
of
the
other
this
one
had
carried
his
head
low
with
his
great
hat
drawn
down
on
his
head
the
priest
wondered
too
what
they
carried
in
their
trunks
when
he
went
down
to
supper
in
the
great
room
of
the
inn
he
could
not
forbear
looking
round
for
them
but
only
one
was
to
be
seen
the
liveried
servant
who
had
done
the
talking
robin
turned
to
his
neighbour
a
lawyer
with
whom
he
had
spoken
a
few
times
that
is
a
new
livery
to
me
he
said
nodding
towards
the
stranger
that
said
the
lawyer
that
why
that
is
the
livery
of
walsingham
i
have
seen
it
in
london
towards
the
end
of
supper
a
stir
broke
out
among
the
servants
who
sat
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
near
the
windows
that
looked
out
upon
the
streets
two
or
three
sprung
up
from
the
tables
and
went
to
look
out
what
is
that
cried
the
lawyer
it
is
beale
going
past
sir
answered
a
voice
robin
lifted
his
eyes
with
an
effort
and
looked
even
as
he
did
so
there
came
a
trampling
of
horses
hoofs
and
then
in
the
light
that
streamed
from
the
windows
there
appeared
a
company
on
horseback
they
were
too
far
away
from
where
he
sat
and
the
lights
were
too
confusing
for
him
to
see
more
than
the
general
crowd
that
went
by
perhaps
from
a
dozen
to
twenty
all
told
but
by
them
ran
the
heads
of
men
who
had
waited
at
the
bridge
to
see
them
go
by
and
a
murmuring
of
voices
came
even
through
the
closed
windows
it
was
plain
that
others
besides
those
who
were
close
to
her
grace
saw
a
sinister
significance
in
beale
arrival
vi
robin
had
hardly
reached
his
room
after
supper
and
a
little
dessert
in
the
parlour
before
merton
came
in
he
drew
his
hand
out
of
his
breast
as
he
entered
and
with
a
strange
look
gave
the
priest
a
folded
letter
robin
took
it
without
a
word
and
read
it
through
after
a
pause
he
said
to
the
other
who
were
those
two
men
that
came
before
supper
i
saw
them
ride
up
there
is
only
one
sir
he
is
one
of
walsingham
men
there
were
two
said
the
priest
i
will
inquire
sir
said
the
young
man
looking
anxiously
from
the
priest
face
to
the
note
and
back
again
robin
noticed
it
it
is
bad
news
he
said
shortly
i
must
say
no
more
will
you
inquire
for
me
and
come
and
tell
me
at
once
when
the
young
man
had
gone
robin
read
the
note
again
before
destroying
it
i
spoke
to
sir
he
will
have
none
of
it
he
seemed
highly
suspicious
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
you
if
you
value
your
safety
more
than
her
grace
possible
comfort
you
had
best
leave
at
once
in
any
case
use
great
caution
then
in
a
swift
hurried
hand
there
followed
a
is
just
now
arrived
and
is
closeted
with
sir
a
all
is
over
i
think
ten
minutes
later
merton
came
back
and
found
the
priest
still
in
the
same
attitude
sitting
on
the
bed
they
will
have
none
of
it
sir
he
said
they
say
that
one
only
came
in
advance
of
mr
beale
he
came
a
little
closer
and
robin
could
see
that
he
was
excited
but
you
are
right
sir
for
all
their
lies
i
saw
supper
plates
and
an
empty
flagon
come
down
from
the
stair
that
leads
to
the
little
chamber
above
the
kitchen
chapter
viii
i
overhead
lay
the
heavy
sky
of
like
a
curved
sheet
of
dark
steel
glimmering
far
away
to
the
left
with
gashes
of
pale
light
in
front
towered
the
twin
gateway
seeming
in
the
gloom
to
lean
forward
to
its
fall
lights
shone
here
and
there
in
the
windows
vanished
and
appeared
again
flashing
themselves
back
from
the
invisible
water
beneath
about
behind
and
on
either
side
there
swayed
and
murmured
this
huge
crowd
invisible
in
the
darkness
peasants
gentlemen
clerks
grooms
all
on
an
equality
at
last
awed
by
a
common
tragedy
into
silence
except
for
words
exchanged
here
and
there
in
an
undertone
or
whispered
and
left
unanswered
or
sudden
murmured
prayers
to
a
god
who
hid
himself
indeed
now
and
again
from
beyond
the
veiling
walls
came
the
tramp
of
men
once
three
or
four
brisk
notes
blown
on
a
horn
once
the
sudden
rumble
of
a
drum
and
once
when
the
silence
grew
profound
three
or
four
blows
of
iron
on
wood
but
at
that
the
murmur
rose
into
a
groan
and
drowned
it
again
so
the
minutes
passed
since
soon
after
midnight
the
folks
had
been
gathering
here
many
had
not
slept
all
night
ever
since
the
report
had
run
like
fire
through
the
little
town
last
evening
that
the
sentence
had
been
delivered
to
the
prisoner
from
that
time
onwards
the
road
that
led
down
past
the
castle
had
never
been
empty
it
was
now
moving
on
to
dawn
the
late
dawn
of
february
and
every
instant
the
scene
grew
more
distinct
it
was
possible
for
those
pushed
against
the
wall
or
against
the
chains
of
the
bridge
that
had
been
let
down
an
hour
ago
to
look
down
into
the
chilly
water
of
the
moat
to
see
not
the
silhouette
only
of
the
huge
fortress
but
the
battlements
of
the
wall
and
now
and
again
a
steel
cap
and
a
pass
beyond
it
as
the
sentry
went
to
and
fro
noises
within
the
castle
grew
more
frequent
the
voice
of
an
officer
was
heard
half
a
dozen
times
the
rattle
of
the
clash
of
steel
the
melancholy
bray
of
the
ran
up
a
minor
scale
and
down
again
the
of
a
drum
rang
out
and
was
thrown
back
in
throbs
by
the
encircling
walls
the
galloping
of
horses
was
heard
three
or
four
times
as
a
tore
up
the
village
street
and
was
forced
to
halt
far
away
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
some
country
squire
maybe
to
whom
the
amazing
news
had
come
an
hour
ago
still
there
was
no
movement
of
the
great
doors
across
the
bridge
the
men
on
guard
there
shifted
their
positions
nodded
a
word
or
two
across
to
one
another
changed
their
pikes
from
one
hand
to
the
other
it
seemed
as
if
day
would
come
and
find
the
affair
no
further
advanced
then
without
warning
for
so
do
great
climaxes
always
come
the
doors
wheeled
back
on
their
hinges
disclosing
a
line
of
pikemen
drawn
up
under
the
vaulted
entrance
a
sharp
command
was
uttered
by
an
officer
at
their
head
causing
the
two
sentries
to
advance
across
the
bridge
a
great
roaring
howl
rose
from
the
surging
crowd
and
in
an
instant
the
whole
lane
was
in
confusion
robin
felt
himself
pushed
this
way
and
that
he
struggled
violently
driving
his
elbows
right
and
left
was
lifted
for
a
moment
clean
from
his
feet
by
the
pressure
about
him
slipped
down
again
gained
a
yard
or
two
lost
them
gained
three
or
four
in
a
sudden
swirl
and
immediately
found
his
feet
on
wood
instead
of
earth
and
himself
racing
desperately
as
a
loose
group
of
runners
across
the
bridge
and
beneath
the
arch
of
the
ii
when
he
was
able
to
take
breath
again
and
to
substitute
thought
for
blind
instinct
he
found
himself
tramping
in
a
kind
of
stream
of
men
into
what
appeared
an
impenetrably
packed
crowd
he
was
going
between
ropes
however
which
formed
a
lane
up
which
it
was
possible
to
move
this
lane
after
crossing
half
the
court
wheeled
suddenly
to
one
side
and
doubled
on
itself
conducting
the
newcomers
behind
the
crowd
of
privileged
persons
that
had
come
into
the
castle
overnight
or
had
been
admitted
three
or
four
hours
ago
these
persons
were
all
people
of
quality
many
of
them
out
of
a
kind
of
sympathy
for
what
was
to
happen
were
in
black
they
stood
there
in
rows
scarcely
moving
scarcely
speaking
some
even
filling
up
now
so
far
as
the
priest
could
see
the
entire
court
except
in
that
quarter
in
which
he
presently
found
himself
the
furthest
corner
away
from
where
rose
up
the
tall
carved
and
traceried
windows
of
the
yet
though
no
man
spoke
above
an
undertone
a
steady
low
murmur
filled
the
court
from
side
to
side
like
the
sound
of
a
wagon
rolling
over
a
paved
road
he
reached
his
place
at
last
actually
against
the
wall
of
the
lodgings
and
found
presently
that
a
low
row
of
projecting
stones
enabled
him
to
raise
himself
a
few
inches
and
see
at
any
rate
a
little
better
than
his
neighbours
he
had
perceived
one
thing
instantly
namely
that
his
dream
of
getting
near
enough
to
the
queen
to
give
her
absolution
before
her
death
was
an
impossible
one
he
had
known
since
yesterday
that
the
execution
was
to
take
place
in
the
hall
and
here
was
he
within
the
court
certainly
yet
as
far
as
possible
away
from
where
he
most
desired
to
be
the
last
two
days
had
gone
by
in
a
horror
that
there
is
no
describing
all
the
hours
of
them
he
had
passed
at
his
parlour
window
waiting
hopelessly
for
the
summons
which
never
came
john
merton
had
gone
to
the
castle
and
come
back
each
time
with
more
desolate
news
there
was
not
a
possibility
he
said
when
the
news
was
finally
certified
of
getting
a
place
in
the
hall
three
hundred
gentlemen
had
had
those
places
already
assigned
four
or
five
hundred
more
it
was
expected
would
have
space
reserved
for
them
in
the
courtyard
the
only
possibility
was
to
be
early
at
the
gateway
since
a
limited
number
of
these
would
probably
be
admitted
an
hour
or
so
before
the
time
fixed
for
the
execution
the
priest
had
seen
many
sights
from
his
parlour
window
during
those
two
days
on
monday
he
had
seen
early
in
the
morning
beale
ride
out
with
his
men
to
go
to
my
lord
shrewsbury
who
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
seen
him
return
in
time
for
dinner
with
a
number
of
strangers
among
whom
was
an
ecclesiastic
on
inquiry
he
found
this
to
be
fletcher
dean
of
peterborough
who
had
been
appointed
to
attend
mary
both
in
her
lodgings
and
upon
the
scaffold
in
the
afternoon
the
street
was
not
empty
for
half
an
hour
from
all
sides
poured
in
horsemen
gentlemen
riding
in
with
their
servants
yeomen
and
farmers
come
in
from
the
countryside
that
they
might
say
hereafter
that
they
had
at
least
been
in
fotheringay
when
a
queen
suffered
the
death
of
the
axe
so
the
dark
had
fallen
yet
lights
moved
about
continually
and
horses
hoofs
never
ceased
to
beat
or
the
voices
of
men
to
talk
until
he
fell
asleep
at
last
in
his
he
listened
always
to
these
things
watched
the
lights
prayed
softly
to
himself
clenched
his
nails
into
his
hands
for
indignation
and
looked
again
on
the
tuesday
morning
came
the
sheriff
to
dine
at
the
castle
with
sir
amyas
a
great
figure
of
a
man
dignified
and
stalwart
riding
in
the
midst
of
his
men
after
dinner
came
the
earl
of
kent
and
last
of
all
my
lord
shrewsbury
himself
he
who
had
been
her
grace
gaoler
until
he
proved
too
kind
for
elizabeth
taste
now
appointed
with
peculiar
malice
to
assist
at
her
execution
he
looked
pale
and
dejected
as
he
rode
past
beneath
the
window
yet
all
this
time
the
supreme
horror
had
been
that
the
end
was
not
absolutely
certain
all
in
fotheringay
were
as
convinced
as
men
could
be
who
had
not
seen
the
warrant
nor
heard
it
read
that
beale
had
brought
it
with
him
on
sunday
night
the
priest
above
all
from
his
communications
with
bourgoign
was
morally
certain
that
the
terror
was
come
at
last
it
was
not
until
the
last
night
of
mary
life
on
earth
was
beginning
to
close
in
that
john
merton
came
up
to
the
parlour
white
and
terrified
to
tell
him
that
he
had
been
in
his
master
room
half
an
hour
ago
and
that
melville
had
come
in
to
them
his
face
all
slobbered
with
tears
and
had
told
him
that
he
had
but
just
come
from
her
grace
rooms
and
had
heard
with
his
own
ears
the
sentence
read
to
her
and
her
gallant
and
noble
answer
he
had
bidden
him
to
go
straight
off
to
the
priest
with
a
message
from
bourgoign
and
himself
to
the
effect
that
the
execution
was
appointed
for
eight
next
morning
and
that
he
was
to
be
at
the
gate
of
the
castle
not
later
than
three
if
by
good
fortune
he
might
be
admitted
when
the
gates
were
opened
at
seven
iii
and
now
that
the
priest
was
in
his
place
he
began
again
to
think
over
that
answer
of
the
queen
the
very
words
of
it
indeed
he
did
not
know
for
a
month
or
two
later
when
bourgoign
wrote
to
him
at
length
but
this
at
least
he
knew
that
her
grace
had
said
and
no
man
contradicted
her
at
that
time
that
she
would
shed
her
blood
with
all
the
happiness
in
the
world
since
it
was
for
the
cause
of
the
catholic
and
roman
church
that
she
died
it
was
not
for
any
plot
that
she
was
to
die
she
professed
again
kissing
her
bible
as
she
did
so
that
she
was
utterly
guiltless
of
any
plot
against
her
sister
she
died
because
she
was
of
that
faith
in
which
she
had
been
born
and
which
elizabeth
had
repudiated
as
for
death
she
did
not
fear
it
she
had
looked
for
it
during
all
the
eighteen
years
of
her
imprisonment
it
was
at
a
martyrdom
then
that
he
was
to
assist
he
had
known
that
without
a
doubt
ever
since
the
day
that
mary
had
declared
her
innocence
at
chartley
there
had
been
no
possibility
of
thinking
otherwise
and
as
he
reflected
on
this
he
remembered
that
he
too
was
guilty
of
the
same
crime
and
he
wondered
whether
he
too
would
die
as
manfully
if
the
need
for
it
ever
came
then
in
an
instant
he
was
called
back
by
the
sudden
crash
of
horns
and
drums
playing
all
together
he
saw
again
the
ranks
of
heads
before
him
the
great
arched
windows
of
the
hall
on
the
other
side
of
the
court
the
grim
dominating
keep
and
the
merciless
february
morning
sky
over
all
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
was
going
on
on
all
sides
of
him
men
jostled
and
murmured
aloud
one
said
she
is
coming
down
another
it
is
all
over
another
they
have
awakened
her
what
is
it
what
is
it
whispered
robin
to
the
air
watching
waves
of
movement
pass
over
the
serried
heads
before
him
the
lights
were
still
burning
here
and
there
in
the
windows
and
the
tall
panes
of
the
hall
were
all
aglow
as
if
a
great
fire
burned
within
overhead
the
sky
had
turned
to
daylight
at
last
but
they
were
grey
clouds
that
filled
the
heavens
so
far
as
he
could
see
meanwhile
the
horns
brayed
in
unison
a
rough
melody
like
the
notes
of
bugles
and
the
drums
beat
out
the
time
again
there
was
a
long
pause
in
which
the
lapse
of
time
was
incalculable
time
had
no
meaning
here
men
waited
from
incident
to
incident
only
the
moving
of
a
line
of
steel
caps
a
pause
in
the
music
a
head
thrust
out
from
a
closed
window
and
drawn
back
again
again
the
music
broke
out
and
this
time
it
was
an
air
that
they
played
a
lilting
melancholy
melody
that
the
priest
recognised
yet
could
not
identify
men
laughed
subduedly
near
him
he
saw
a
face
wrinkled
with
bitter
mirth
turned
back
and
he
heard
what
was
said
it
was
jumping
joan
that
was
being
played
the
march
consecrated
to
the
burning
of
witches
he
had
heard
it
long
ago
as
a
boy
then
the
rumour
ran
through
the
crowd
and
spent
itself
at
last
in
the
corner
where
the
priest
stood
trembling
with
wrath
and
pity
she
is
in
the
hall
it
was
impossible
to
know
whether
this
were
true
or
whether
she
had
not
been
there
half
an
hour
already
the
horror
was
that
all
might
be
over
or
not
yet
begun
or
in
the
very
act
of
doing
he
had
thought
that
there
would
be
some
pause
or
warning
that
a
signal
would
be
given
perhaps
that
all
might
bare
their
heads
or
pray
at
this
violent
passing
of
a
queen
but
there
was
none
the
heads
surged
and
quieted
murmurs
burst
out
and
died
again
and
all
the
while
the
hateful
insolent
melody
rose
and
fell
the
horns
bellowed
the
drums
crashed
it
sounded
like
some
shocking
a
riot
of
desperate
spirits
moved
in
it
trampling
up
and
down
as
if
in
one
last
fling
of
devilish
gaiety
then
suddenly
the
heads
grew
still
a
wave
of
motionlessness
passed
over
them
as
if
some
strange
sympathy
were
communicated
from
within
those
tall
windows
the
moments
passed
and
passed
it
was
impossible
to
hear
those
murmurs
through
the
blare
of
the
instruments
there
was
one
sound
only
that
could
penetrate
them
and
this
rising
from
what
seemed
at
first
the
wailing
of
a
child
grew
and
grew
into
the
shrill
cries
of
a
dog
in
agony
at
the
noise
once
more
a
roar
of
low
questioning
surged
up
and
fell
simultaneously
the
music
came
to
an
abrupt
close
and
as
if
at
a
signal
there
sounded
a
great
roar
of
voices
all
shouting
together
within
the
hall
it
rose
yet
louder
broke
out
of
doors
and
was
taken
up
by
those
outside
the
court
was
now
one
sea
of
tossing
heads
and
open
mouths
shouting
as
if
in
exultation
or
in
anger
robin
fought
for
his
place
on
the
projecting
stones
clung
to
the
rough
wall
gripped
a
and
drew
himself
yet
higher
then
as
he
clenched
himself
tight
and
stared
out
again
towards
the
tall
windows
that
shone
in
bloody
flakes
of
fire
from
the
roaring
logs
within
a
sudden
and
profound
silence
fell
once
more
before
being
shattered
again
by
a
thousand
roaring
throats
for
there
in
full
view
beyond
the
clear
glass
stood
a
tall
black
figure
masked
to
the
mouth
who
held
in
his
hands
a
wide
silver
dish
in
which
lay
something
white
and
round
and
slashed
with
crimson
part
iv
chapter
i
i
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
then
said
marjorie
and
leaned
back
with
a
white
exhausted
face
we
can
do
no
more
it
was
a
little
council
of
papists
that
was
gathered
a
year
after
the
queen
death
at
fotheringay
in
mistress
manners
parlour
john
fitzherbert
was
there
he
had
ridden
up
an
hour
before
with
heavy
news
from
padley
and
its
messenger
mistress
alice
was
there
quiet
as
ever
yet
paler
and
thinner
than
in
former
years
mistress
babington
herself
had
gone
back
to
her
family
last
year
and
last
robin
himself
was
there
having
himself
borne
the
news
from
derby
he
had
had
an
eventful
year
yet
never
yet
had
he
come
within
reach
of
the
pursuivant
but
he
had
largely
effected
this
by
the
particular
care
which
he
had
observed
with
regard
to
matstead
and
his
silence
as
to
his
own
identity
extraordinary
care
too
was
observed
by
his
friends
who
had
learned
by
now
to
call
him
even
in
private
by
his
alias
and
it
appeared
certain
that
beyond
a
dozen
or
two
of
discreet
persons
it
was
utterly
unsuspected
that
the
stately
bearded
young
gentleman
named
robert
alban
the
man
of
god
as
like
other
priests
he
was
commonly
called
amongst
the
catholics
had
any
connection
whatever
with
the
hawking
hunting
and
lover
of
mistress
manners
it
was
known
indeed
that
robin
had
gone
abroad
years
ago
to
be
made
priest
but
those
who
thought
of
him
at
all
or
at
least
as
returned
believed
him
sent
to
some
other
part
of
england
for
the
sake
of
his
father
and
it
was
partly
because
of
the
very
fact
that
his
father
was
so
hot
against
the
papists
that
it
had
been
thought
safe
at
rheims
to
send
him
to
derbyshire
since
this
would
be
the
very
last
place
in
which
he
would
be
looked
for
he
had
avoided
matstead
then
riding
through
it
once
only
by
night
with
strange
emotions
and
had
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
south
of
derbyshire
crossing
more
than
once
over
into
stafford
and
chester
and
returning
to
padley
or
to
booth
edge
once
in
every
three
or
four
months
he
had
learned
a
hundred
lessons
in
these
wanderings
of
his
the
news
that
he
had
now
brought
with
him
was
of
the
worst
he
had
heard
from
catholics
in
derby
that
simpson
returned
again
after
his
banishment
recaptured
a
month
or
two
ago
and
awaiting
trial
at
the
lent
assizes
was
beginning
to
falter
death
was
a
certainty
for
him
this
time
and
it
appeared
that
he
had
seemed
very
timorous
before
two
or
three
friends
who
had
visited
him
in
gaol
declaring
that
he
had
done
all
that
a
man
could
do
that
he
was
being
worn
out
by
suffering
and
privation
and
that
there
was
some
limit
after
all
to
what
god
almighty
should
demand
marjorie
had
cried
out
just
now
driven
beyond
herself
at
the
thought
of
what
all
this
must
mean
for
the
catholics
of
the
countryside
many
of
whom
already
had
fallen
away
during
the
last
year
or
two
beneath
the
pitiless
storm
of
fines
suspicions
and
threats
had
cried
out
that
it
was
impossible
that
such
a
man
as
simpson
could
fall
that
the
ruin
it
would
bring
upon
the
faith
must
be
proportionate
to
the
influence
he
already
had
won
throughout
the
country
by
his
years
of
labour
entreating
finally
when
the
trustworthiness
of
the
report
had
been
forced
upon
her
at
last
that
she
herself
might
be
allowed
to
go
and
see
him
and
speak
with
him
in
prison
this
however
had
been
strongly
refused
by
her
counsellors
just
now
they
had
declared
that
her
help
was
invaluable
that
the
amazing
manner
in
which
her
little
retired
house
on
the
moors
had
so
far
evaded
grave
suspicion
rendered
it
one
of
the
greatest
safeguards
that
the
hunted
catholics
possessed
that
the
work
she
was
doing
by
her
organization
of
messengers
and
letters
must
not
be
risked
even
for
the
sake
of
a
matter
like
this
she
had
given
in
at
last
but
her
spirit
seemed
broken
altogether
ii
there
is
one
more
matter
said
robin
presently
uncrossing
one
splashed
leg
from
over
the
other
i
had
not
thought
to
speak
of
it
but
i
think
it
best
now
to
do
so
it
concerns
myself
a
little
and
therefore
if
i
may
flatter
myself
it
concerns
my
friends
too
he
smiled
genially
upon
the
company
for
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
he
had
learned
in
his
travels
it
was
that
the
tragic
air
never
yet
helped
any
man
marjorie
lifted
her
eyes
a
moment
mistress
manners
he
said
you
remember
my
speaking
to
you
after
fotheringay
of
a
fellow
of
my
lord
shrewsbury
who
honoured
me
with
his
suspicions
she
nodded
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
him
from
that
day
to
this
to
this
he
added
and
this
morning
in
the
open
street
in
derby
whom
should
i
meet
with
but
young
merton
and
his
father
her
grace
servants
have
suffered
horribly
since
last
year
but
that
is
a
tale
for
another
day
well
i
stopped
to
speak
with
these
two
the
young
man
hath
left
service
a
while
back
it
seems
and
is
to
try
his
fortune
in
france
well
we
were
speaking
of
this
and
that
when
who
should
come
by
but
a
party
of
men
and
my
lord
shrewsbury
in
the
midst
riding
with
roger
columbell
and
immediately
behind
them
my
friend
of
the
inn
of
fotheringay
it
was
all
the
in
the
world
that
it
should
be
at
such
moment
if
he
had
seen
me
alone
he
would
have
thought
no
more
of
me
but
seeing
me
with
young
jack
merton
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
i
will
stake
my
hat
he
knew
me
again
marjorie
was
looking
full
at
him
now
what
was
my
lord
shrewsbury
doing
in
derby
with
mr
columbell
mused
john
biting
his
moustaches
it
was
the
very
question
i
put
to
myself
said
robin
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
seeing
where
they
went
they
went
to
columbell
own
house
and
indoors
of
it
the
held
the
horses
at
the
door
i
watched
them
awhile
from
biddell
window
but
they
were
still
there
when
i
came
away
at
last
what
hour
was
that
asked
the
old
man
that
would
be
after
i
had
dined
early
and
i
met
them
afterwards
my
lord
would
surely
be
dining
with
columbell
but
that
is
no
answer
to
my
question
it
rather
pierces
down
to
the
further
point
why
was
my
lord
shrewsbury
dining
with
columbell
shrewsbury
is
a
great
lord
columbell
is
a
little
magistrate
my
lord
hath
his
own
house
in
the
country
and
there
be
good
inns
in
derby
he
stopped
short
what
is
the
matter
mistress
manners
he
asked
what
of
yourself
she
said
sharply
you
were
speaking
of
yourself
robin
laughed
i
had
forgotten
myself
for
once
why
yes
i
intended
to
ask
the
company
what
i
had
best
do
what
with
this
news
of
simpson
and
the
report
mistress
manners
gives
us
of
the
a
poor
priest
must
look
to
himself
in
these
days
and
not
for
his
own
sake
only
now
my
lord
shrewsbury
man
knows
nothing
of
me
except
that
i
had
strange
business
at
fotheringay
a
year
ago
but
to
have
had
strange
business
at
fotheringay
a
year
ago
is
a
suspicious
circumstance
and
alban
broke
in
the
old
man
you
had
best
do
nothing
at
all
you
were
not
followed
from
derby
you
are
as
safe
in
padley
or
here
as
you
could
be
anywhere
in
england
all
that
you
had
best
do
is
to
remain
here
a
week
or
two
and
not
go
down
to
derby
again
for
the
present
i
think
that
showing
of
yourself
openly
in
towns
hath
its
dangers
as
well
as
its
safeguards
john
glanced
round
marjorie
bowed
her
head
in
assent
i
will
do
precisely
as
you
say
said
robin
easily
and
now
for
the
news
of
her
grace
servants
he
had
already
again
and
again
told
the
tale
of
fotheringay
so
far
as
he
had
seen
it
in
this
very
parlour
at
first
he
had
hardly
found
himself
able
to
speak
of
it
without
tears
he
had
described
the
scene
he
had
looked
upon
when
in
the
rush
that
had
been
made
towards
the
hall
after
mary
head
had
been
shown
at
the
window
he
had
found
a
place
and
had
been
forced
along
partly
with
his
will
and
partly
against
it
right
through
the
great
doors
into
the
very
place
where
the
queen
had
suffered
and
he
had
told
the
story
so
well
that
his
listeners
had
seemed
to
see
it
for
themselves
the
great
hall
hung
with
black
throughout
the
raised
scaffold
at
the
further
end
beside
the
fire
that
blazed
on
the
wide
hearth
the
queen
servants
being
led
away
as
he
came
in
the
dress
of
velvet
the
straw
and
the
bloody
sawdust
the
beads
and
all
the
other
pitiful
relics
being
heaped
upon
the
fire
as
he
stood
there
in
the
struggling
mob
and
above
all
the
fallen
body
in
its
short
skirt
and
bodice
lying
there
where
it
fell
beside
the
low
black
block
he
had
told
all
this
as
he
had
seen
it
for
himself
until
the
sheriff
men
drove
them
all
forth
again
into
the
court
and
he
had
told
too
of
all
that
he
had
heard
afterwards
that
had
happened
until
my
lord
shrewsbury
son
had
ridden
out
at
a
gallop
to
take
the
news
to
court
and
the
imprisoned
watchers
had
been
allowed
to
leave
the
castle
how
the
little
dog
that
he
had
heard
wailing
had
leapt
out
as
the
head
fell
at
the
third
stroke
so
that
he
was
all
bathed
in
his
mistress
blood
one
of
the
very
spaniels
no
doubt
which
he
himself
had
seen
at
chartley
how
the
dog
was
taken
away
and
washed
and
given
afterwards
into
melville
charge
how
the
body
and
the
head
had
been
taken
upstairs
had
been
roughly
embalmed
and
laid
in
a
locked
chamber
how
her
servants
had
been
found
peeping
through
the
keyhole
and
praying
aloud
there
till
sir
amyas
had
had
the
hole
stopped
up
he
had
told
them
too
of
the
events
that
followed
of
the
mass
de
préau
had
been
permitted
to
say
in
the
queen
oratory
on
the
morning
after
and
of
the
oath
that
he
had
been
forced
to
take
that
he
would
not
say
it
again
of
the
destruction
of
the
oratory
and
the
confiscation
of
the
altar
furniture
and
vestments
all
this
he
had
told
little
by
little
and
of
the
queen
noble
bearing
upon
the
scaffold
her
utter
fearlessness
her
protestations
that
she
died
for
her
religion
and
for
that
only
and
of
the
pesterings
of
fletcher
dean
of
peterborough
who
had
at
last
given
over
in
despair
and
prayed
instead
the
rest
they
knew
for
themselves
of
the
miserable
falseness
of
elizabeth
who
feigned
after
having
signed
the
warrant
and
sent
it
that
it
was
davison
fault
for
doing
as
she
told
him
and
of
her
accusations
accusations
that
deceived
no
man
against
those
who
had
served
her
of
the
fires
made
in
the
streets
of
all
great
towns
as
a
mark
of
official
rejoicing
over
mary
death
and
of
the
pitiful
restitution
made
by
the
great
funeral
in
peterborough
six
months
after
and
the
royal
escutcheons
and
the
tapers
and
the
hearse
and
all
the
rest
of
the
lying
pretences
by
which
the
murderess
sought
to
absolve
her
victim
from
the
crime
of
being
murdered
well
it
was
all
over
and
now
he
told
them
of
what
he
had
heard
from
young
merton
in
derby
of
how
nau
mary
french
secretary
the
one
who
had
served
her
for
eleven
years
and
had
been
loaded
by
her
kindness
had
been
rewarded
also
by
elizabeth
and
that
the
nature
of
his
services
was
unmistakable
while
all
the
rest
of
them
who
had
refused
utterly
to
take
any
part
in
the
insolent
mourning
at
peterborough
either
in
the
cathedral
or
at
the
banquet
had
fallen
under
her
grace
displeasure
so
that
some
of
them
even
now
were
scarcely
out
of
ward
bourgoign
alone
excepted
since
he
was
allowed
to
take
the
news
of
the
death
to
their
graces
of
france
and
had
most
wisely
remained
there
ever
since
so
the
party
sat
round
the
fire
in
the
same
little
parlour
where
they
had
sat
so
often
before
with
the
lutes
and
wreaths
embroidered
on
the
hangings
and
icarus
in
the
chariot
of
the
sun
and
robin
after
telling
his
tale
answered
question
after
question
till
silence
fell
and
all
sat
motionless
thinking
of
the
woman
who
while
dead
yet
spoke
then
john
stood
up
clapped
the
priest
on
the
back
and
said
that
they
two
must
be
off
to
padley
for
the
night
iii
they
had
all
risen
to
their
feet
when
a
knocking
came
on
the
door
and
janet
looked
in
she
seemed
a
little
perturbed
if
you
please
sir
she
said
to
john
one
of
your
men
is
come
up
from
padley
and
wishes
to
speak
to
you
alone
john
gave
a
quick
glance
at
the
others
if
you
will
allow
me
he
said
i
will
go
down
and
speak
with
him
in
the
hall
the
rest
sat
down
again
it
was
the
kind
of
interruption
that
might
be
wholly
innocent
yet
coming
when
it
did
it
affected
them
a
little
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
bad
news
everywhere
the
minutes
passed
yet
no
one
returned
once
marjorie
went
to
the
door
and
listened
but
there
was
only
the
faint
wail
of
the
winter
wind
up
the
stairs
to
be
heard
then
five
minutes
later
there
were
steps
and
john
came
in
his
face
looked
a
little
stern
but
he
smiled
with
his
mouth
we
poor
papists
are
in
trouble
again
he
said
mistress
manners
you
must
let
us
stay
here
all
night
if
you
will
and
we
will
be
off
early
in
the
morning
there
is
a
party
coming
to
us
from
derby
or
next
day
it
is
not
known
which
why
yes
and
what
party
said
marjorie
quietly
enough
though
she
must
have
guessed
its
character
the
smile
left
his
mouth
it
is
my
son
that
is
behind
it
he
said
i
had
wondered
we
had
not
had
news
of
him
there
is
to
be
a
general
search
for
seminarists
in
the
high
peak
he
glanced
at
robin
by
order
of
my
lord
shrewsbury
your
namesake
mistress
john
manners
and
our
friend
columbell
are
commissioned
to
search
and
fenton
and
myself
are
singled
out
to
be
apprehended
immediately
thomas
knows
that
i
am
at
padley
and
that
eyre
will
come
in
there
for
candlemas
the
day
after
in
that
i
recognize
my
son
knowledge
well
i
will
dispatch
my
man
who
brought
the
news
to
eyre
to
bid
him
to
avoid
the
place
and
we
two
alban
and
myself
will
make
our
way
across
the
border
into
stafford
there
are
none
others
coming
to
padley
asked
marjorie
none
that
i
know
of
they
will
come
in
sometimes
without
warning
but
i
can
not
help
that
fenton
will
be
at
tansley
he
told
me
so
how
did
the
news
come
asked
robin
it
seems
that
the
preacher
walton
in
derby
hath
been
warned
that
we
shall
be
delivered
to
him
two
days
hence
it
was
his
servant
that
told
one
of
mine
i
fear
he
will
be
his
sermons
to
us
all
for
nothing
he
smiled
bitterly
again
robin
could
see
the
misery
in
this
man
heart
at
the
thought
that
it
was
his
own
son
who
had
contrived
this
thomas
had
been
quiet
for
many
months
no
doubt
in
order
to
strike
the
more
surely
in
his
new
function
as
sworn
man
of
her
grace
yet
he
would
seem
to
have
failed
we
shall
not
get
our
candles
then
this
year
either
smiled
thomas
lanterns
are
all
that
we
shall
have
there
was
not
much
time
to
be
lost
luggage
had
to
be
packed
since
it
would
not
be
safe
for
the
three
to
return
until
at
least
two
or
three
weeks
had
passed
and
marjorie
besides
had
to
prepare
a
list
of
places
and
names
that
must
be
dealt
with
on
their
way
places
where
word
must
be
left
that
the
hunt
was
up
again
and
names
of
particular
persons
that
were
to
be
warned
garlick
and
ludlam
were
in
the
county
and
these
must
be
specially
informed
since
they
were
known
and
garlick
in
particular
had
already
suffered
banishment
and
returned
again
so
that
there
would
be
no
hope
for
him
if
he
were
once
more
captured
the
four
sat
late
that
night
and
robin
wondered
more
than
ever
not
only
at
the
of
the
girl
but
at
her
extraordinary
knowledge
of
catholic
affairs
in
the
county
she
calculated
almost
without
mistake
as
was
afterwards
shown
not
only
which
priests
were
in
derbyshire
but
within
a
very
few
miles
of
where
they
would
be
and
at
what
time
she
showed
a
kind
of
chart
which
she
had
drawn
up
of
the
movements
of
the
persons
concerned
explaining
the
plan
by
which
each
priest
if
he
desired
might
go
on
his
own
circuit
where
he
would
be
most
needed
she
lamented
however
the
fewness
of
the
priests
and
attributed
to
this
the
growing
laxity
of
many
families
living
it
might
be
in
upland
farms
or
in
inaccessible
places
where
they
could
but
very
seldom
have
the
visits
of
the
priest
and
the
strength
of
the
sacraments
before
midnight
therefore
the
two
travellers
had
complete
directions
for
their
journey
as
well
as
papers
to
help
their
memories
as
to
where
the
news
was
to
be
left
and
at
last
john
stood
up
and
stretched
himself
we
must
go
to
bed
he
said
we
must
be
booted
by
five
marjorie
nodded
to
alice
who
stood
up
saying
she
would
show
him
where
his
bed
had
been
prepared
robin
lingered
for
a
moment
to
finish
his
last
notes
alban
said
marjorie
suddenly
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
paper
on
which
she
wrote
yes
you
will
take
care
will
you
not
she
said
john
is
a
little
you
must
keep
him
to
his
route
i
will
do
my
best
said
robin
smiling
she
lifted
her
clear
eyes
to
his
without
tremor
or
shame
my
heart
would
be
broken
altogether
if
aught
happened
to
you
i
look
to
you
as
our
lord
chief
soldier
in
this
county
but
that
is
so
she
said
i
do
not
know
any
man
who
has
been
made
perfect
in
so
short
a
time
you
hold
us
all
in
your
hands
chapter
ii
i
it
was
in
bassett
house
at
langley
that
the
news
of
the
attack
on
padley
reached
the
two
travellers
a
month
later
and
it
bore
news
in
it
that
they
little
expected
for
it
seemed
that
entirely
unexpectedly
there
had
arrived
at
padley
the
following
night
no
less
than
three
of
the
fitzherbert
family
anthony
the
seventh
son
with
two
of
his
sisters
as
well
as
thomas
fitzherbert
wife
who
rode
with
them
whether
as
a
spy
or
not
was
never
known
further
fenton
himself
hearing
of
their
coming
had
ridden
up
from
tansley
and
missed
the
messenger
that
marjorie
had
sent
out
they
had
not
arrived
till
late
missing
again
by
a
series
of
mischances
the
scouts
marjorie
had
posted
and
on
discovering
their
danger
had
further
discovered
the
house
to
be
already
watched
they
judged
it
better
therefore
as
marjorie
said
in
her
letter
to
feign
unconsciousness
of
any
charge
against
them
since
there
was
no
priest
in
the
house
who
could
incriminate
them
all
this
the
travellers
learned
for
the
first
time
at
langley
they
had
gone
through
into
staffordshire
as
had
been
arranged
and
there
had
moved
about
from
house
to
house
of
catholic
friends
without
any
trouble
it
was
when
at
last
they
thought
it
safe
to
be
moving
homewards
and
had
arrived
at
langley
that
they
found
marjorie
letter
awaiting
them
it
was
addressed
to
john
fitzherbert
and
was
brought
by
robin
old
servant
dick
sampson
the
assault
was
made
wrote
marjorie
according
to
the
arrangement
columbell
himself
came
with
a
score
of
men
and
surrounded
the
house
very
early
having
set
watchers
all
in
place
the
evening
before
they
had
made
certain
they
should
catch
the
master
and
at
least
a
priest
or
two
but
i
have
very
heavy
news
for
all
that
for
there
had
come
to
the
house
after
dark
anthony
fitzherbert
with
two
of
his
sisters
thomas
fitzherbert
and
fenton
himself
and
they
have
carried
the
two
gentlemen
to
the
derby
gaol
i
have
had
no
word
from
anthony
but
i
hear
that
he
said
that
he
was
glad
that
his
father
was
not
taken
and
that
his
own
taking
he
puts
down
to
his
brother
account
as
yourself
sir
also
did
the
men
did
no
great
harm
in
padley
beyond
breaking
a
panel
or
two
they
were
too
careful
i
suppose
of
what
they
think
will
be
topcliffe
property
some
day
and
they
found
none
of
the
which
is
good
news
the
rest
of
the
party
they
let
go
free
again
for
the
present
i
have
another
piece
of
bad
news
too
which
is
no
more
than
what
we
had
looked
for
that
simpson
at
the
assizes
was
condemned
to
death
but
has
promised
to
go
to
church
so
that
his
life
is
spared
if
he
will
do
so
he
is
still
in
the
gaol
however
where
i
pray
god
that
anthony
may
meet
with
him
and
bring
him
to
a
better
mind
so
that
he
hath
not
yet
denied
our
lord
even
though
he
hath
promised
to
do
so
may
god
comfort
and
console
you
fitzherbert
for
this
news
of
anthony
that
i
send
the
letter
ended
with
messages
to
the
party
with
instructions
for
their
way
of
return
if
they
should
come
within
the
next
week
and
with
the
explanation
given
above
of
the
series
of
misfortunes
by
which
any
came
to
be
at
padley
that
night
and
how
it
was
that
they
did
not
attempt
to
break
out
again
the
capture
of
anthony
was
indeed
one
more
blow
to
his
father
but
robin
was
astonished
how
cheerfully
he
bore
it
and
said
as
much
when
they
two
were
alone
in
the
garden
the
grey
old
man
smiled
while
his
eyelids
twitched
a
little
they
say
that
when
a
man
is
whipped
he
feels
no
more
after
awhile
the
former
blows
prepare
him
and
dull
his
nerves
for
the
later
which
i
take
it
is
part
of
god
mercy
well
alban
my
father
hath
been
in
prison
a
great
while
now
my
son
thomas
is
a
traitor
and
a
sworn
man
of
her
grace
i
myself
have
been
fined
and
persecuted
till
i
have
had
to
sell
land
to
pay
the
fines
with
i
have
seen
family
after
family
fall
from
their
faith
and
deny
it
so
i
take
it
that
i
feel
the
joy
that
i
have
a
son
who
is
ready
to
suffer
for
it
more
than
the
pain
i
have
in
thinking
on
his
sufferings
the
one
may
perhaps
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
other
and
yet
help
him
to
repentance
life
here
at
langley
was
more
encouraging
than
the
furtive
existence
necessary
in
the
north
of
derbyshire
bassett
had
a
confident
way
with
him
that
was
like
wine
to
fainting
hearts
and
he
had
every
reason
to
be
confident
since
up
to
the
present
beyond
being
forced
to
pay
the
usual
fines
for
recusancy
he
had
scarcely
been
troubled
at
all
and
lived
in
considerable
prosperity
having
even
been
sheriff
of
stafford
in
virtue
of
his
other
estates
at
blore
his
house
at
langley
was
a
great
one
standing
in
a
park
and
showing
no
signs
of
poverty
his
servants
were
largely
catholic
he
entertained
priests
and
refugees
of
all
kinds
freely
although
discreetly
and
he
laughed
at
the
notion
that
the
persecution
could
be
of
long
endurance
the
very
first
night
the
travellers
had
come
he
had
spoken
with
considerable
freedom
after
supper
look
more
hearty
he
cried
the
spanish
fleet
will
be
here
before
summer
to
relieve
us
of
all
troubles
as
of
all
heretics
too
her
grace
will
have
to
turn
her
coat
once
more
i
think
when
that
comes
to
pass
john
glanced
at
him
doubtfully
first
he
said
no
man
knows
whether
it
will
come
and
next
i
for
one
am
not
sure
if
i
even
wish
for
it
bassett
laughed
loudly
you
will
dance
for
joy
he
said
and
why
do
you
not
know
whether
you
wish
it
to
come
i
have
no
taste
to
be
a
spanish
subject
why
nor
have
i
but
the
king
of
spain
will
but
sail
away
again
when
he
hath
made
terms
against
the
privateers
whether
they
be
those
that
ply
on
the
high
seas
against
men
bodies
or
here
in
england
against
their
souls
there
will
be
no
subjection
of
england
beyond
that
john
was
silent
why
i
heard
from
sir
thomas
but
a
week
ago
to
ask
for
a
little
money
to
pay
his
fines
with
he
said
that
repayment
should
follow
so
soon
as
the
fleet
should
come
those
were
his
very
words
you
sent
the
money
then
why
yes
i
made
shift
that
a
servant
should
throw
down
a
bag
with
ten
pounds
in
it
into
a
bush
and
that
brittlebank
your
man
should
see
him
do
it
and
lo
when
we
looked
again
the
bag
was
gone
he
laughed
again
with
open
mouth
certainly
he
was
an
inspiriting
man
with
a
loud
bark
of
his
own
but
robin
imagined
that
he
would
not
bite
too
cruelly
for
all
that
but
he
saw
another
side
of
him
presently
what
was
that
matter
of
sutton
the
priest
who
was
executed
in
stafford
last
year
asked
john
suddenly
the
face
of
the
other
changed
as
abruptly
his
eyes
became
under
his
grey
eyebrows
and
his
mouth
tightened
what
of
him
he
said
it
was
reported
that
you
might
have
stayed
the
execution
and
would
not
i
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
it
is
true
said
bassett
sharply
at
least
a
portion
of
it
true
listen
cried
the
other
suddenly
and
tell
me
what
you
would
have
done
sutton
was
taken
and
was
banished
and
came
back
again
as
any
worthy
priest
would
do
then
he
was
taken
again
and
condemned
i
did
my
utmost
to
save
him
but
i
could
not
then
as
i
would
never
have
any
part
in
the
death
of
a
priest
for
his
religion
another
was
appointed
to
carry
the
execution
through
three
days
before
news
was
brought
to
me
by
a
private
hand
that
sutton
had
promised
to
give
the
names
of
priests
whom
he
knew
and
of
houses
where
he
had
said
mass
and
i
know
not
what
else
and
it
was
said
to
me
that
i
might
on
this
account
stay
the
execution
until
he
had
told
all
that
he
could
now
i
knew
that
i
could
not
save
his
life
altogether
that
was
forfeited
and
there
could
be
no
forgiveness
all
that
i
might
do
was
to
respite
him
for
a
little
and
for
what
that
he
might
damn
his
own
soul
eternally
and
bring
a
great
number
of
good
men
into
trouble
and
peril
of
death
for
themselves
i
sent
the
messenger
away
again
and
said
that
i
would
listen
to
no
such
tales
and
sutton
died
like
a
good
priest
three
days
after
repenting
i
doubt
not
bitterly
of
the
weakness
into
which
he
had
fallen
now
sir
what
would
you
have
done
in
my
place
he
wagged
his
face
fiercely
from
side
to
side
john
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
nodded
without
speaking
robin
sat
silent
it
was
not
only
for
priests
it
seemed
that
life
presented
a
tangle
ii
the
evening
before
the
two
left
for
the
north
again
bassett
took
them
both
into
his
own
study
it
was
a
little
room
opening
out
of
his
bedroom
and
was
more
full
of
books
than
robin
had
ever
seen
except
in
the
library
at
rheims
in
any
room
in
the
world
a
shelf
ran
round
the
room
high
on
the
wall
and
was
piled
with
manuscripts
to
the
ceiling
beneath
the
that
ran
nearly
round
the
room
were
packed
with
volumes
and
a
number
more
lay
on
the
table
and
even
in
the
corners
this
is
my
own
privy
chamber
said
bassett
to
the
priest
my
other
friends
have
seen
it
many
a
time
but
i
thought
i
would
show
it
to
your
reverence
too
robin
looked
round
him
in
wonder
he
had
no
idea
that
his
host
was
a
man
of
such
learning
all
the
books
are
ranged
in
their
proper
places
went
on
the
other
i
could
put
my
finger
on
any
of
them
but
this
is
the
shelf
i
wished
you
to
see
he
took
him
to
one
that
was
behind
the
door
holding
up
the
candle
that
he
might
see
the
shelf
had
a
box
or
two
on
it
besides
books
and
these
he
opened
and
set
on
the
table
robin
looked
in
as
he
was
told
but
could
understand
nothing
that
he
saw
in
one
was
a
round
ball
of
crystal
on
a
little
gold
stand
wrapped
round
in
velvet
in
another
some
kind
of
a
machine
with
wheels
in
a
third
some
dried
substances
as
of
herbs
tied
together
with
silk
he
inspected
them
gravely
but
was
not
invited
to
touch
them
then
his
host
touched
him
on
the
breast
with
one
finger
and
recoiled
smiling
this
is
my
magic
he
said
john
here
does
not
like
it
neither
did
poor
fenton
when
he
was
here
but
i
hold
there
is
no
harm
in
such
things
if
one
does
but
observe
caution
what
do
you
do
with
them
sir
inquired
the
priest
curiously
for
he
was
not
sure
whether
the
man
was
serious
well
sir
i
hold
that
god
has
written
his
will
in
the
stars
and
in
the
burning
of
herbs
and
in
the
shining
of
the
sun
and
such
things
there
is
no
black
magic
here
but
just
as
we
read
in
the
sky
at
morning
if
it
be
red
or
yellow
whether
it
will
be
foul
or
fair
so
i
hold
that
god
has
written
other
secrets
of
his
in
other
things
and
that
by
observing
them
and
judging
rightly
we
may
guess
what
he
has
in
store
i
knew
that
a
prince
was
to
die
last
year
before
ever
it
happened
i
knew
that
a
fleet
of
ships
will
come
to
england
this
year
before
ever
an
anchor
is
weighed
and
i
would
have
you
notice
that
here
are
fitzherbert
and
your
reverence
too
fleeing
for
your
lives
and
here
sit
i
safe
at
home
and
all
as
i
hold
because
i
have
been
able
to
observe
by
my
magic
what
is
to
come
to
pass
but
that
strikes
at
the
doctrine
of
cried
the
priest
no
sir
i
think
it
does
not
god
foreknowledge
doth
not
hinder
the
use
of
our
which
is
a
mystery
no
doubt
yet
none
the
less
true
then
why
should
god
foreknowledge
any
more
hinder
our
when
he
chooses
to
communicate
it
to
us
robin
was
silent
he
knew
little
or
nothing
of
these
things
except
from
his
theological
reading
yet
he
felt
uneasy
the
other
said
nothing
and
the
stars
too
he
asked
i
hold
said
bassett
that
the
stars
have
certain
influences
and
powers
upon
those
that
are
born
under
their
signs
i
do
not
hold
that
we
are
so
ruled
by
these
that
we
have
no
action
of
our
own
any
more
than
we
are
compelled
to
be
wet
through
by
rain
or
scorched
by
the
sun
we
may
always
come
into
a
house
or
shelter
beneath
a
tree
and
thus
escape
them
so
too
i
hold
with
the
stars
there
is
an
old
saying
sir
fool
is
ruled
by
his
stars
the
wise
man
rules
them
that
is
in
a
nutshell
my
faith
in
the
matter
i
have
told
fenton
fortune
here
and
fitzherbert
only
they
will
never
listen
to
me
robin
looked
round
the
room
it
was
dark
outside
long
ago
they
had
supped
at
sunset
and
sat
for
half
an
hour
over
their
banquet
of
sweetmeats
and
wine
before
coming
upstairs
and
the
room
too
was
as
dark
as
night
except
where
far
off
in
the
west
beyond
the
tall
trees
of
the
park
a
few
red
streaks
lingered
he
felt
oppressed
and
miserable
the
place
seemed
to
him
sinister
he
hated
these
fumblings
at
locks
that
were
surely
meant
to
remain
closed
yet
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
john
had
wandered
off
to
one
of
the
windows
and
was
humming
uneasily
to
himself
then
suddenly
an
intense
curiosity
overcame
him
his
life
was
a
strange
and
perilous
one
he
carried
it
in
his
hand
every
day
in
the
morning
he
could
not
be
sure
but
that
he
would
be
fleeing
before
evening
as
he
fell
asleep
he
could
not
be
sure
that
he
would
not
be
awakened
to
a
new
dream
he
had
long
ago
conquered
those
moods
of
terror
which
in
spite
of
his
courage
had
come
down
on
him
sometimes
in
some
lonely
farm
perhaps
where
flight
would
be
impossible
or
in
what
was
far
more
dangerous
in
some
crowded
inn
where
every
movement
was
known
these
had
passed
he
thought
never
to
come
back
but
in
that
little
room
with
these
curious
things
in
boxes
on
the
table
and
his
merry
host
peering
at
him
gravely
and
the
still
evening
outside
with
the
knowledge
that
he
was
to
ride
back
to
his
own
country
whence
he
had
fled
for
fear
of
his
life
six
weeks
ago
leaving
the
security
of
this
house
for
the
perils
of
the
peak
and
all
that
suspected
region
from
which
even
now
probably
the
pursuit
had
not
altogether
died
away
here
a
sudden
intense
desire
to
know
what
the
future
might
hold
overcame
him
tell
me
sir
he
said
you
have
told
fitzherbert
fortune
you
say
as
well
as
others
have
you
told
mine
since
i
have
been
here
there
was
a
moment
silence
john
was
silent
with
his
back
turned
robin
looked
up
at
his
host
wondering
why
he
did
not
answer
then
bassett
took
up
the
candle
come
he
said
we
have
been
here
long
enough
chapter
iii
i
there
will
be
a
company
of
us
said
john
to
the
two
priests
as
he
helped
them
to
dismount
alban
has
sent
his
man
forward
from
derby
to
say
that
he
will
be
here
before
night
ludlam
and
i
are
together
for
once
said
garlick
we
must
separate
again
he
is
for
the
north
again
he
tells
me
there
has
been
no
more
trouble
not
a
word
of
it
they
were
beaten
last
time
and
will
not
try
again
i
think
for
the
present
you
heard
of
the
attempt
at
candlemas
then
it
had
been
a
quiet
time
enough
ever
since
lent
throughout
the
whole
county
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
heat
of
the
assault
had
cooled
for
want
of
success
plainly
a
great
deal
had
been
staked
upon
the
attack
on
padley
which
for
its
remoteness
from
towns
was
known
to
be
a
where
priests
could
always
find
harbourage
and
indeed
it
was
time
that
the
catholics
should
have
a
little
breathing
space
things
had
been
very
bad
with
them
the
arrest
of
simpson
and
still
more
his
weakness
though
he
had
not
as
yet
actually
fulfilled
his
promise
of
going
to
church
and
was
still
detained
in
gaol
the
growing
lukewarmness
of
families
that
seldom
saw
a
priest
the
blows
struck
at
the
fitzherbert
family
and
above
all
the
defection
of
thomas
all
these
things
had
brought
the
hearts
of
the
faithful
very
low
john
himself
had
had
an
untroubled
time
since
his
return
a
little
before
easter
but
he
had
taken
the
precaution
not
to
remain
too
long
at
padley
at
one
time
he
had
visited
his
other
estates
at
swynnerton
and
elsewhere
and
had
even
been
back
again
at
langley
but
there
had
been
no
hint
of
any
pursuit
padley
had
remained
untouched
the
men
went
about
their
farm
business
the
housekeeper
peered
from
her
windows
without
a
glimpse
of
armed
men
such
as
had
terrified
the
household
on
candlemas
day
it
was
only
last
night
indeed
that
the
master
had
returned
in
time
to
meet
the
two
priests
who
had
asked
for
shelter
for
a
day
or
two
they
had
stayed
here
before
continually
as
well
as
at
booth
edge
during
their
travels
both
in
the
master
absence
and
when
he
was
at
home
there
were
a
couple
of
rooms
kept
vacant
always
for
men
of
god
and
all
priests
who
came
were
instructed
of
course
in
case
of
necessity
as
to
the
that
owen
had
contrived
a
few
years
before
never
however
had
there
been
any
use
made
of
them
it
was
a
hot
july
afternoon
when
the
two
priests
were
met
by
john
outside
the
arched
gate
that
ran
between
the
hall
and
the
buttery
they
had
already
dined
at
a
farm
a
few
miles
down
the
valley
but
they
were
taken
round
the
house
at
once
to
the
walled
garden
where
drink
and
food
were
set
out
here
their
dusty
boots
were
pulled
off
they
laid
aside
their
hats
and
were
presently
at
their
ease
again
they
were
plain
men
these
two
though
garlick
had
been
educated
at
oxford
and
before
his
going
to
rheims
had
been
schoolmaster
at
tideswell
in
appearance
he
was
a
breezy
sunburnt
man
with
very
little
of
the
clerk
about
him
and
devoted
to
outdoor
sports
which
was
something
of
a
disguise
to
him
since
he
could
talk
hawking
and
riding
in
mixed
company
with
a
real
knowledge
of
the
facts
he
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
with
a
strong
derbyshire
accent
which
he
had
never
lost
and
now
deliberately
used
ludlam
looked
for
more
of
the
priest
he
was
a
man
of
with
hair
turning
to
grey
on
his
temples
and
with
a
very
pleasant
disarming
smile
he
spoke
very
little
but
listened
with
an
interested
and
attentive
air
both
were
of
course
dressed
in
the
usual
riding
costume
of
gentlemen
and
used
good
horses
it
was
exceedingly
good
to
sit
here
with
the
breeze
from
over
the
moors
coming
down
on
them
with
cool
drink
before
them
and
the
prospect
of
a
secure
day
at
any
rate
in
this
stronghold
their
host
too
was
contented
and
serene
and
said
so
frankly
i
am
more
at
peace
gentlemen
he
said
than
i
have
been
for
the
past
five
years
my
son
is
in
gaol
yet
and
i
am
proud
that
he
should
be
there
since
my
eldest
son
he
broke
off
a
moment
and
i
think
the
worst
of
the
storm
is
over
her
grace
is
busying
herself
with
other
matters
you
mean
the
spanish
fleet
sir
said
garlick
he
nodded
it
is
not
that
i
look
for
final
deliverance
from
spain
he
said
i
have
no
wish
to
be
aught
but
an
englishman
as
i
said
to
bassett
a
while
ago
but
i
think
the
fleet
will
distract
her
grace
for
a
while
and
it
may
very
well
mean
that
we
have
better
treatment
hereafter
what
news
is
there
sir
i
hear
that
the
londoners
buzz
continually
with
false
alarms
it
was
thought
that
the
fleet
might
arrive
on
any
day
but
i
understand
that
the
say
that
nothing
as
yet
been
seen
by
the
end
of
the
month
i
daresay
we
shall
have
news
so
they
talked
pleasantly
in
the
shade
till
the
shadows
began
to
lengthen
they
were
far
enough
here
from
the
to
feel
somewhat
detached
from
the
excitement
that
was
beginning
to
seethe
in
the
south
at
plymouth
it
was
said
all
had
been
in
readiness
for
a
month
or
two
past
at
tilbury
my
lord
leicester
was
steadily
gathering
troops
but
here
inland
it
was
more
of
an
academic
question
the
little
happenings
in
derby
the
changes
of
weather
in
the
farms
the
deaths
of
old
people
from
the
summer
heats
these
things
were
far
more
vital
and
significant
than
the
distant
thunders
of
spain
a
beacon
or
two
had
been
piled
on
the
hills
by
order
of
the
authorities
to
pass
on
the
news
when
it
should
come
a
few
lads
had
disappeared
from
the
countryside
to
drill
in
derby
marketplace
but
except
for
these
things
all
was
very
much
as
it
had
been
from
the
beginning
the
expected
catastrophe
meant
little
more
to
such
folk
than
the
coming
of
the
judgment
day
certain
but
infinitely
remote
from
the
grasp
of
the
imagination
the
three
were
talking
of
robin
as
they
came
down
towards
the
house
for
supper
and
as
they
turned
the
corner
he
himself
was
at
that
moment
dismounting
he
looked
surprisingly
cool
and
considering
his
ride
up
the
hot
valley
he
had
taken
his
journey
easily
he
said
as
he
had
had
a
long
day
yesterday
and
i
made
a
round
to
pay
a
visit
to
mistress
manners
he
said
i
found
her
when
i
got
there
and
alice
says
she
will
not
be
at
mass
she
stood
too
long
in
the
sun
yesterday
at
the
carrying
of
the
hay
it
is
no
more
than
that
mistress
manners
is
a
marvel
to
me
said
garlick
as
they
went
towards
the
house
neither
wife
nor
nun
and
she
rules
her
house
like
a
man
and
she
knows
if
a
priest
lift
his
little
finger
in
derby
she
sent
me
my
whole
itinerary
for
this
last
circuit
of
mine
and
every
point
fell
out
as
she
said
robin
thought
that
he
had
seldom
had
so
pleasant
a
supper
as
on
that
night
the
windows
of
the
low
hall
where
he
had
dined
so
often
as
a
boy
were
flung
wide
to
catch
the
scented
evening
air
the
sun
was
round
to
the
west
and
threw
long
golden
rays
that
were
all
lovely
light
and
no
heat
slantways
on
the
paved
floor
and
the
polished
tables
and
the
bright
pewter
down
at
the
lower
end
sat
the
servants
brown
men
burned
by
the
sun
lean
as
panthers
scarcely
speaking
ravenous
after
their
long
day
in
the
hayfields
and
up
here
three
companions
with
whom
he
was
wholly
at
his
ease
the
evening
was
as
still
as
night
except
for
the
faint
peaceful
country
sounds
that
came
up
from
the
valley
below
the
song
of
a
lad
riding
home
the
barking
of
a
dog
the
bleat
of
sheep
all
minute
and
delicate
as
unperceived
yet
as
effective
as
a
rich
fabric
on
which
a
design
is
woven
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
listened
to
the
talk
the
brisk
shrewd
remarks
of
garlick
the
courteous
and
rather
melancholy
answers
of
his
host
as
he
watched
the
second
priest
eyes
looking
gently
and
pleasantly
about
him
as
he
ate
the
plain
good
food
and
drank
the
country
drink
that
in
spite
of
all
his
lot
was
cast
in
very
sweet
places
there
was
not
a
hint
here
of
disturbance
or
of
passions
or
of
ugly
strife
there
was
no
clatter
as
in
the
streets
of
derby
or
pressure
of
humanity
or
wearying
politics
of
the
he
found
himself
in
one
of
those
moods
that
visit
all
men
sometimes
when
the
world
appears
after
all
a
homely
and
a
genial
place
when
the
simplest
things
are
the
best
when
no
excitement
or
ambition
or
furious
zeal
can
compare
with
the
gentle
happiness
of
a
tired
body
that
is
in
the
act
of
refreshment
or
of
a
driven
mind
that
is
finding
its
relaxation
at
least
he
said
to
himself
he
would
enjoy
this
night
and
the
next
day
and
the
night
after
with
all
his
heart
the
four
found
themselves
so
much
at
ease
here
that
the
dessert
was
brought
in
to
them
where
they
sat
and
it
was
then
that
the
first
unhappy
word
was
spoken
mr
simpson
said
garlick
suddenly
is
there
any
more
news
of
him
john
shook
his
head
he
hath
not
yet
been
to
church
thank
god
he
said
so
much
i
know
for
certain
but
he
hath
promised
to
go
why
is
he
not
yet
gone
he
promised
a
great
while
ago
i
hear
he
hath
been
sick
derby
gaol
is
a
pestiferous
place
they
are
waiting
i
suppose
till
he
is
well
enough
to
go
publicly
that
all
the
world
may
be
advertised
of
it
garlick
gave
a
bursting
sigh
i
can
not
understand
it
at
all
he
said
there
has
never
been
so
zealous
a
priest
i
have
ridden
with
him
again
and
again
before
i
was
a
priest
he
was
always
quiet
but
i
took
him
to
be
one
of
those
souls
that
need
never
brag
why
it
was
here
that
we
heard
him
tell
of
nelson
death
john
threw
out
his
hands
these
prisons
are
devilish
he
said
they
wear
a
man
out
as
the
rack
can
never
do
why
see
my
son
he
cried
oh
i
can
speak
of
him
if
i
am
but
moved
enough
it
was
that
same
derby
gaol
that
wore
him
out
too
it
is
the
darkness
and
the
ill
food
and
the
stenches
and
the
misery
a
man
heart
fails
him
there
who
could
face
a
thousand
deaths
in
the
sunlight
man
after
man
hath
fallen
there
both
in
derby
and
in
london
and
in
all
the
prisons
it
is
their
heart
that
goes
all
the
courage
runs
from
them
like
water
with
their
health
if
it
were
the
rack
and
the
rope
only
england
would
be
catholic
yet
i
think
the
old
man
face
blazed
with
indignation
it
was
not
often
that
he
so
spoke
out
his
mind
it
was
very
easy
to
see
that
he
had
thought
continually
of
his
son
fall
mistress
manners
hath
told
me
the
very
same
thing
said
robin
she
visited
thomas
in
gaol
once
at
least
she
said
that
her
heart
failed
her
altogether
there
ludlam
smiled
i
suppose
it
is
so
he
said
gently
since
you
say
so
but
i
think
it
would
not
be
so
with
me
the
rack
and
the
rope
rather
are
what
would
shake
me
to
the
roots
unless
god
his
grace
prevailed
more
than
it
ever
yet
hath
with
see
he
smiled
again
robin
shook
his
head
sharply
as
for
me
he
said
grimly
with
tight
lips
it
was
a
lovely
night
of
stars
as
the
four
stepped
out
of
the
archway
before
going
upstairs
to
the
parlour
behind
them
stood
the
square
and
solid
house
resembling
a
very
fortress
the
lights
that
had
been
brought
in
still
shone
through
the
windows
and
a
hundred
night
insects
leapt
and
poised
in
the
brightness
and
before
them
lay
the
deep
valley
silent
now
except
for
the
trickle
of
the
stream
dark
since
the
moon
was
not
yet
risen
except
for
one
light
that
burned
far
away
in
some
on
the
other
side
and
this
light
went
out
like
a
closing
eye
even
as
they
looked
but
overhead
where
god
dwelt
all
heaven
was
alive
the
huge
arch
resting
as
it
appeared
on
the
monstrous
bases
of
the
moors
and
hills
standing
round
this
place
like
the
mountains
about
jerusalem
was
one
shimmering
vault
of
glory
as
if
it
was
there
that
the
home
of
life
had
its
place
and
this
earth
beneath
but
a
bedroom
for
mortals
or
for
those
that
were
too
weary
to
aspire
or
climb
the
suggestion
was
enormously
powerful
here
was
this
mortal
earth
that
needed
rest
so
cruelly
that
must
have
darkness
to
refresh
its
tired
eyes
coolness
to
recuperate
its
passion
and
silence
if
ever
its
ears
were
to
hear
again
but
there
was
radiance
unending
all
day
a
dome
of
rigid
blue
all
night
a
span
of
glittering
lights
the
very
home
of
a
glory
that
knows
no
waste
and
that
therefore
needs
no
reviving
it
was
to
that
only
therefore
that
a
life
must
be
chained
which
would
not
falter
or
fail
in
the
unending
tides
and
changes
of
the
world
a
soft
breeze
sprang
up
among
the
tops
of
the
chestnuts
and
the
sound
was
as
of
the
going
of
a
great
company
that
whispered
for
silence
ii
it
was
within
an
hour
of
dawn
that
the
first
mass
was
said
next
morning
by
robert
alban
the
chapel
was
decked
out
as
they
seldom
dared
to
deck
it
in
those
days
but
the
failure
of
the
last
attempt
on
this
place
and
the
peace
that
had
followed
made
them
bold
the
carved
chest
of
oak
was
in
its
place
with
a
rich
carpet
of
silk
spread
on
its
face
and
on
the
top
the
three
linen
cloths
as
prescribed
by
the
ritual
two
silver
candlesticks
that
stood
usually
on
the
high
shelf
over
the
and
a
silver
crucifix
of
flemish
work
taken
from
the
were
in
a
row
on
the
back
with
red
and
white
flowers
between
beneath
the
linen
cloths
a
tiny
flat
elevation
showed
where
the
altar
stone
lay
the
rest
of
the
chapel
in
its
usual
hangings
had
only
sweet
herbs
on
the
floor
with
two
or
three
long
seats
carried
up
from
the
hall
below
an
extraordinary
sweetness
and
peace
seemed
in
the
place
both
to
the
senses
and
the
soul
of
the
young
priest
as
he
went
up
to
the
altar
to
vest
confessions
had
been
heard
last
night
and
as
he
turned
in
the
absolute
stillness
of
the
morning
and
saw
beneath
those
carved
angels
that
still
lean
from
the
beams
of
the
roof
the
whole
little
space
already
filled
with
many
of
whom
were
to
approach
the
altar
presently
and
the
grey
head
of
their
master
kneeling
on
the
floor
to
answer
the
mass
it
appeared
to
him
as
if
the
promise
of
last
night
were
reversed
and
that
it
was
after
all
earth
rather
than
heaven
that
proclaimed
the
peace
and
the
glory
of
god
robin
served
the
second
mass
himself
said
by
garlick
and
made
his
thanksgiving
as
well
as
he
could
meanwhile
but
he
found
what
appeared
to
him
at
the
time
many
distractions
in
watching
the
tanned
face
and
hands
of
the
man
who
was
so
utterly
a
countryman
for
of
his
life
and
so
utterly
a
priest
for
the
rest
his
very
sturdiness
and
breeziness
made
his
reverence
the
more
evident
and
pathetic
he
read
the
mass
rapidly
in
a
low
voice
harshened
by
shouting
in
the
open
air
over
his
sports
made
his
gestures
abruptly
and
yet
did
the
whole
with
an
extraordinary
attention
after
the
communion
when
he
turned
for
the
wine
and
water
his
face
as
so
often
with
rude
folk
in
a
great
emotion
browned
as
it
was
with
wind
and
sun
seemed
lighted
from
within
he
seemed
etherealized
yet
with
his
virility
all
alive
in
him
a
phrase
wholly
inapplicable
in
its
first
sense
came
irresistibly
to
the
younger
priest
mind
as
he
waited
on
him
when
the
strong
man
armed
keepeth
his
house
his
goods
are
in
peace
robin
heard
the
third
mass
said
by
ludlam
from
a
corner
near
the
door
and
this
one
too
was
a
fresh
experience
the
former
priest
had
resembled
a
strong
man
subdued
by
grace
the
second
a
weak
man
ennobled
by
it
ludlam
was
a
delicate
soul
smiling
often
as
has
been
said
and
speaking
little
a
mild
man
said
the
countryfolk
yet
at
the
altar
there
was
no
weakness
in
him
he
was
as
a
keen
sharp
blade
fitted
as
a
heavy
knife
can
not
be
for
fine
and
peculiar
work
his
father
had
been
a
yeoman
as
had
the
other
yet
there
must
have
been
some
unusual
strain
of
blood
in
him
so
deft
and
gentle
he
was
more
at
his
ease
here
at
god
table
than
at
the
table
of
any
man
so
he
too
finished
his
mass
and
began
to
unvest
then
with
a
noise
as
brutal
as
a
blasphemy
there
came
a
thunder
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
a
man
burst
into
the
room
with
glaring
eyes
and
rough
gestures
there
is
a
company
of
men
coming
up
from
the
valley
he
cried
and
another
over
the
moor
and
it
is
my
lord
shrewsbury
livery
iii
in
an
instant
all
was
in
confusion
and
the
peace
had
fled
john
was
gone
and
his
voice
could
be
heard
on
the
open
stairs
outside
speaking
rapidly
in
sharp
low
whispers
to
the
men
gathered
beneath
and
meanwhile
three
or
four
servants
two
men
and
a
couple
of
maids
previously
drilled
in
their
duties
were
at
the
altar
on
which
ludlam
had
but
that
moment
laid
down
his
amice
the
three
priests
stood
together
waiting
fearing
to
hinder
or
to
add
to
the
bustle
a
low
wailing
rose
from
outside
the
door
and
robin
looked
from
it
to
see
if
there
were
anything
he
could
do
but
it
was
only
a
little
country
servant
crouching
on
the
tiny
landing
that
united
the
two
sets
of
stairs
from
the
court
with
her
apron
over
her
head
she
must
have
been
in
the
partitioned
west
end
of
the
chapel
to
hear
the
mass
he
said
a
word
to
her
and
the
next
instant
was
pushed
aside
as
a
man
tore
by
bearing
a
great
bundle
of
stuffs
vestments
and
the
altar
cloths
when
he
turned
again
the
chapel
was
become
a
common
room
once
more
the
chest
stood
bare
with
a
great
bowl
of
flowers
on
it
the
candlesticks
were
gone
and
the
maid
was
sweeping
up
the
herbs
come
gentlemen
said
a
sharp
voice
at
the
door
there
is
no
time
to
lose
he
went
out
with
the
two
others
behind
and
followed
john
downstairs
already
the
party
of
servants
was
dispersed
to
their
stations
two
or
three
to
keep
the
doors
no
doubt
and
the
rest
back
to
kitchen
work
and
the
like
to
give
the
impression
that
all
was
as
usual
the
four
went
straight
down
into
the
hall
to
find
it
empty
except
for
one
man
who
stood
by
the
but
a
surprising
change
had
taken
place
here
instead
of
the
solemn
panelling
with
the
carved
shield
that
covered
the
wall
over
the
hearth
there
was
a
great
doorway
opened
through
which
showed
not
the
bricks
of
the
but
a
black
space
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
see
here
said
john
there
is
room
for
two
here
but
no
more
there
is
room
for
a
third
in
another
little
chamber
upstairs
that
is
nearly
joined
on
to
this
but
it
is
not
so
good
now
gentlemen
this
is
the
safer
of
the
two
asked
robin
abruptly
i
think
it
to
be
so
make
haste
gentlemen
robin
wheeled
on
the
others
he
said
that
there
was
no
time
to
argue
in
see
he
said
i
have
not
yet
been
taken
at
all
garlick
hath
been
taken
and
ludlam
hath
had
a
warning
there
is
no
question
that
you
must
be
here
i
utterly
refuse
began
garlick
robin
went
to
the
door
in
three
strides
and
was
out
of
it
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
ran
upstairs
as
he
reached
the
head
his
eye
caught
a
glint
of
sunlight
on
some
metal
far
up
on
the
moor
beyond
the
belt
of
trees
he
did
not
turn
his
head
again
he
went
straight
in
and
waited
presently
he
heard
steps
coming
up
and
john
appeared
smiling
and
out
of
breath
i
have
them
in
he
said
by
promising
that
there
was
no
great
difference
after
all
and
that
there
was
no
time
now
sir
and
he
went
towards
the
wall
at
which
long
ago
owen
had
worked
so
hard
and
yourself
sir
asked
robin
as
once
more
an
innocent
piece
of
panelling
moved
outwards
under
john
hand
i
see
to
that
but
not
until
you
are
in
but
the
old
man
face
blazed
suddenly
up
obey
me
if
you
please
i
am
the
master
here
i
tell
you
i
have
a
very
good
place
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
robin
advanced
to
the
opening
and
sat
down
to
slide
himself
in
it
was
a
little
door
about
two
feet
square
with
a
hole
beneath
it
drop
gently
alban
whispered
the
voice
in
his
ear
the
altar
vessels
are
at
the
bottom
with
the
crucifix
on
some
soft
stuff
that
is
it
slide
in
and
let
yourself
slip
there
is
some
food
and
drink
there
too
robin
did
so
the
floor
of
the
little
chamber
was
about
five
feet
down
and
he
could
feel
woodwork
on
all
three
sides
of
him
when
the
door
is
closed
said
the
voice
from
the
daylight
push
a
pair
of
bolts
on
right
and
left
till
they
go
home
tap
upon
the
shutter
when
it
is
done
the
light
vanished
and
robin
was
aware
of
a
faint
smell
of
smoke
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
noticed
a
newly
lit
fire
on
the
hearth
of
the
hall
he
found
the
bolts
pushed
them
and
tapped
lightly
three
times
he
heard
a
hand
push
on
the
shutter
to
see
that
all
was
secure
and
then
footsteps
go
away
over
the
floor
on
a
level
with
his
chin
then
he
remembered
that
he
must
be
in
the
same
chamber
with
his
two
separated
from
them
by
the
flooring
on
which
he
stood
he
rapped
gently
with
his
foot
twice
two
soft
taps
came
back
silence
followed
iv
time
as
once
before
in
his
experience
seemed
wholly
banished
from
this
place
there
were
moments
of
reflection
when
he
appeared
to
himself
as
having
but
just
entered
there
were
other
moments
when
he
might
have
been
here
for
an
eternity
that
had
no
divisions
to
mark
it
he
was
in
complete
and
utter
darkness
there
was
not
a
crack
anywhere
in
the
woodwork
so
perfect
had
been
the
young
carpenter
handiwork
by
which
even
a
glimmer
of
light
could
enter
a
while
ago
he
had
been
in
the
early
morning
sunlight
now
he
might
be
in
the
grave
for
a
while
his
emotions
and
his
thoughts
raced
one
another
tumbling
in
inextricable
confusion
and
they
were
all
emotions
and
thoughts
of
the
present
intense
little
visions
of
the
men
closing
round
the
house
cutting
off
escape
from
the
valley
on
the
one
side
and
from
the
wild
upland
country
on
the
other
questions
as
to
where
john
would
hide
himself
minute
sensible
impressions
of
the
smoky
flavour
of
the
air
the
unplaned
woodwork
the
soft
stuffs
beneath
his
feet
then
they
began
to
extend
themselves
wider
all
with
that
rapid
unjarring
swiftness
he
foresaw
the
bursting
in
of
his
stronghold
the
footsteps
within
three
inches
of
his
head
the
crash
as
the
board
was
kicked
in
then
the
capture
the
ride
to
derby
bound
on
a
horse
the
gaol
the
questioning
the
faces
of
my
lord
shrewsbury
and
the
magistrates
and
the
end
there
were
moments
when
the
sweat
ran
down
his
face
when
he
bit
his
lips
in
agony
and
nearly
moaned
aloud
there
were
others
in
which
he
abandoned
himself
to
christ
crucified
placed
himself
in
everlasting
hands
that
were
mighty
enough
to
pluck
him
not
only
out
of
this
snare
but
from
the
very
hands
that
would
hold
him
so
soon
hands
that
could
lift
him
from
the
rack
and
scaffold
and
set
him
a
free
man
among
his
hills
again
yet
that
had
not
done
so
with
a
score
of
others
whom
he
knew
he
thought
of
these
and
of
the
girl
who
had
done
so
much
to
save
them
all
who
was
now
saved
herself
by
sickness
a
mile
or
two
away
from
these
hideous
straits
then
he
dragged
out
maine
beads
and
began
to
recite
the
there
broke
in
suddenly
the
first
exterior
sign
that
the
hunters
were
on
them
a
muffled
hammering
far
beneath
his
feet
there
were
pauses
then
voices
carried
up
from
the
archway
nearly
beneath
through
the
hollowed
walls
then
hammering
again
but
all
was
heard
as
through
wool
as
the
first
noise
broke
out
his
mind
rearranged
itself
and
seemed
to
have
two
consciousnesses
in
the
foreground
he
followed
intently
and
eagerly
every
movement
below
in
the
background
there
still
moved
before
him
the
pageant
of
deeper
thoughts
and
more
remote
of
prayer
and
wonder
and
fear
and
expectation
and
from
that
onwards
it
continued
so
with
him
even
while
he
followed
the
sounds
he
understood
why
my
lord
shrewsbury
had
made
this
assault
so
suddenly
after
months
of
peace
he
perceived
the
hand
of
thomas
fitzherbert
too
in
the
precision
with
which
the
attack
had
been
made
and
the
certain
information
he
must
have
given
that
priests
would
be
in
padley
that
morning
there
were
noises
that
he
could
not
interpret
vague
tramplings
from
a
direction
which
he
could
not
tell
voices
that
shouted
the
sound
of
metal
on
stone
he
did
interpret
rightly
however
the
sudden
tumult
as
the
gate
was
unbarred
at
last
and
the
shrill
screaming
of
a
woman
as
the
company
poured
through
into
the
house
the
clamour
of
voices
from
beneath
as
the
hall
below
was
filled
with
men
the
battering
that
began
almost
immediately
and
finally
the
rush
of
shod
feet
up
the
outside
staircases
one
of
which
led
straight
into
the
chapel
itself
then
indeed
his
heart
seemed
to
spring
upwards
into
his
throat
and
to
beat
there
as
loud
as
knocking
so
loud
that
it
appeared
to
him
that
all
the
house
must
hear
it
yet
it
was
still
some
minutes
before
the
climax
came
to
him
he
was
still
standing
there
listening
to
voices
talking
it
seemed
almost
in
his
ears
yet
whose
words
he
could
not
hear
the
vibration
of
feet
that
shook
the
solid
joist
against
which
he
had
leaned
his
head
with
closed
eyes
the
brush
of
a
cloak
once
like
a
whisper
against
the
very
panel
that
shut
him
in
he
could
attend
to
nothing
else
the
rest
of
the
drama
was
as
nothing
to
him
he
had
his
business
in
hand
to
keep
away
from
himself
by
the
very
intentness
of
his
will
and
determination
the
feet
that
passed
so
close
the
climax
came
in
a
sudden
thump
of
a
pike
foot
within
a
yard
of
his
head
so
imminent
that
for
an
instant
he
thought
it
was
at
his
own
panel
there
followed
a
splintering
sound
of
a
in
the
same
place
he
understood
they
were
sounding
on
the
woodwork
and
piercing
all
that
rang
hollow
his
turn
then
would
come
immediately
talking
voices
followed
the
crash
then
silence
then
the
vibration
of
feet
once
more
the
strain
grew
unbearable
his
fingers
twisted
tight
in
his
rosary
lifted
themselves
once
or
twice
from
the
floor
edge
on
which
they
were
gripped
to
tear
back
the
bolts
and
declare
himself
it
seemed
to
him
in
those
instants
a
thousand
times
better
to
come
out
of
his
own
will
rather
than
to
be
poked
and
dragged
from
his
hole
like
a
badger
in
the
very
midst
of
such
imaginings
there
came
a
thumping
blow
within
three
inches
of
his
face
and
then
silence
he
leaned
back
desperately
to
avoid
the
that
must
follow
with
his
eyes
screwed
tight
and
his
lips
mumbling
he
waited
and
then
as
he
waited
he
drew
an
irrepressible
hissing
breath
of
terror
for
beneath
the
soft
padding
under
his
feet
he
could
feel
movements
blow
follow
blow
from
the
same
direction
and
last
a
great
clamour
of
voices
all
shouting
together
feet
ran
across
the
floor
on
which
his
hands
were
gripped
again
and
down
the
stairs
he
perceived
two
things
the
chapel
was
empty
again
and
the
priests
below
had
been
found
v
he
could
follow
every
step
of
the
drama
after
that
for
he
appeared
to
himself
now
as
a
mere
witness
without
personal
part
in
it
first
there
were
voices
below
him
so
clear
and
close
that
he
could
distinguish
the
intonation
and
who
it
was
that
spoke
though
the
words
were
inaudible
it
was
garlick
who
first
spoke
a
sentence
of
a
dozen
words
it
might
be
consenting
no
doubt
to
come
out
without
being
dragged
congratulating
perhaps
as
the
manner
was
the
searchers
on
their
success
a
murmur
of
answer
came
back
and
then
one
sharp
peevish
voice
by
itself
again
garlick
spoke
and
there
followed
the
shuffling
of
movements
for
a
long
while
and
then
so
far
as
the
little
chamber
was
concerned
empty
silence
but
from
the
hall
rose
up
a
steady
murmur
of
talk
once
more
again
robin
heart
leaped
in
him
for
there
came
the
rattle
of
a
immediately
below
his
feet
they
were
searching
the
little
chamber
beneath
from
the
level
of
the
hall
to
see
if
it
were
empty
the
pike
was
presently
withdrawn
for
a
long
while
the
talking
went
on
so
far
as
the
rest
of
the
house
was
concerned
the
hidden
man
could
tell
nothing
or
whether
john
were
taken
or
whether
the
search
were
given
up
he
could
not
even
fix
his
mind
on
the
point
he
was
constructing
for
himself
furiously
and
intently
the
scene
he
imagined
in
the
hall
below
he
thought
he
saw
the
two
priests
barred
in
behind
the
high
table
my
lord
shrewsbury
in
the
one
great
chair
in
the
midst
of
the
room
columbell
perhaps
or
john
manners
talking
in
his
ear
the
men
on
guard
over
the
priests
and
beside
the
door
and
another
maybe
standing
by
the
hearth
he
was
so
intent
on
this
that
he
thought
of
little
else
though
still
on
a
strange
background
of
another
consciousness
moved
scenes
and
ideas
such
as
he
had
had
at
the
beginning
and
he
was
torn
from
this
contemplation
with
the
suddenness
of
a
blow
by
a
voice
speaking
it
seemed
within
a
foot
of
his
head
well
we
have
those
rats
at
any
rate
he
perceived
instantly
what
had
happened
the
men
were
back
again
in
the
chapel
and
he
had
not
heard
them
come
he
supposed
that
he
could
hear
the
words
now
because
of
the
breaking
of
the
panel
next
to
his
own
ralph
said
he
was
sure
of
the
other
one
too
said
a
second
voice
which
was
that
one
the
fellow
that
was
at
fotheringay
robin
clenched
his
teeth
like
iron
well
he
is
not
here
there
was
silence
i
have
sounded
that
side
said
the
first
voice
sharply
well
but
i
tell
you
i
have
sounded
it
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
my
lord
hark
said
the
second
voice
there
is
my
lord
man
there
followed
a
movement
of
feet
towards
the
door
as
it
seemed
to
the
priest
he
could
hear
the
first
man
grumbling
to
himself
and
beating
listlessly
on
the
walls
somewhere
then
a
voice
called
something
unintelligible
from
the
direction
of
the
stairs
the
beating
ceased
and
footsteps
went
across
the
floor
again
into
silence
vi
he
was
dazed
and
blinded
by
the
light
when
after
infinite
hours
he
drew
the
bolts
and
slid
the
panel
open
he
had
lost
all
idea
of
time
utterly
he
did
not
know
whether
he
should
find
that
night
had
come
or
that
the
next
day
had
dawned
he
had
waited
there
period
after
period
he
marked
one
of
them
by
eating
food
that
had
no
taste
and
drinking
liquid
that
stung
his
throat
but
did
not
affect
his
palate
he
had
marked
another
by
saying
compline
to
himself
in
a
whisper
during
the
earlier
part
of
those
periods
he
had
followed
he
thought
with
success
the
dreadful
drama
that
was
acted
in
the
house
someone
had
made
a
formal
inspection
of
all
the
chambers
a
man
who
said
little
and
moved
heavily
with
something
of
a
limp
he
had
thought
this
to
be
my
lord
shrewsbury
himself
who
suffered
from
the
gout
this
man
had
walked
slowly
through
the
chapel
and
out
again
at
a
later
period
he
had
heard
the
horses
being
brought
round
the
house
heard
plainly
the
jingle
of
the
bits
and
a
sneeze
or
two
this
had
been
followed
by
long
interminable
talking
muffled
and
indistinguishable
that
came
up
to
him
from
some
unknown
direction
voices
changed
curiously
in
loudness
and
articulation
as
the
speakers
moved
about
at
a
later
period
a
loud
trampling
had
begun
again
plainly
from
the
hall
he
had
interpreted
this
to
mean
that
the
prisoners
were
being
removed
out
of
doors
and
he
had
been
confirmed
in
this
by
hearing
immediately
afterwards
again
the
stamping
of
horses
and
the
creaking
of
leather
again
there
had
been
a
pause
broken
suddenly
by
loud
women
wailing
and
at
last
the
noise
of
horses
moving
off
the
noise
grew
less
a
man
ran
suddenly
through
the
archway
and
out
again
and
little
by
little
complete
silence
once
more
yet
he
had
not
dared
to
move
it
was
the
custom
he
knew
sometimes
to
leave
three
or
four
men
on
guard
for
a
day
or
two
after
such
an
assault
in
the
hope
of
starving
out
any
hidden
fugitives
that
might
still
be
left
so
he
waited
again
period
after
period
he
dozed
a
little
for
weariness
propped
against
the
narrow
walls
of
his
hidinghole
woke
felt
again
for
food
and
found
he
had
eaten
it
all
dozed
again
then
he
had
started
up
suddenly
for
without
any
further
warning
there
had
come
a
tiny
indeterminate
tapping
against
his
panel
he
held
his
breath
and
listened
it
came
again
then
fearlessly
he
drew
back
the
bolts
slid
the
panel
open
and
shut
his
eyes
dazzled
by
the
light
he
crawled
out
at
last
spent
and
dusty
there
was
looking
at
him
only
the
little
maid
whom
he
had
tried
to
comfort
at
some
hour
in
his
life
her
face
was
all
contorted
with
weeping
and
she
had
a
great
smear
of
dust
across
it
what
time
is
it
he
said
it
it
is
after
two
she
whispered
they
have
all
gone
she
nodded
speechless
whom
have
they
taken
fitzherbert
the
priests
the
servants
fitzherbert
they
found
him
then
she
stared
at
him
with
the
dull
incapacity
to
understand
why
he
did
not
know
all
that
she
had
seen
where
did
they
find
him
he
repeated
sharply
the
master
he
opened
the
door
to
them
himself
her
face
writhed
itself
again
into
grotesque
lines
and
she
broke
out
into
shrill
wailing
and
weeping
chapter
iv
i
marjorie
was
still
in
bed
when
the
news
was
brought
her
by
her
friend
she
did
not
move
or
speak
when
mistress
alice
said
shortly
that
fitzherbert
had
been
taken
with
ten
of
his
servants
and
two
priests
you
understand
my
dear
they
have
ridden
away
to
derby
all
of
them
together
but
they
may
come
back
here
suddenly
marjorie
nodded
garlick
and
ludlam
were
in
the
of
the
hall
whispered
mistress
alice
glancing
fearfully
behind
her
marjorie
lay
back
again
on
her
pillows
and
what
of
mr
alban
she
asked
alban
was
upstairs
they
missed
him
he
is
coming
here
after
dark
the
maid
says
an
hour
after
the
priest
came
quietly
upstairs
to
the
parlour
he
showed
no
signs
of
his
experience
except
perhaps
by
a
certain
brightness
in
his
eyes
and
an
extreme
of
manner
marjorie
was
up
to
meet
him
and
had
in
her
hands
a
paper
she
hardly
spoke
a
single
expression
of
relief
at
his
safety
she
was
as
quiet
and
as
ever
you
must
lie
here
she
said
janet
hath
your
room
ready
at
one
in
the
morning
you
must
ride
here
is
a
map
of
your
journey
they
may
come
back
suddenly
at
the
place
i
have
marked
here
with
red
there
is
a
shepherd
hut
you
can
not
miss
it
if
you
follow
the
track
i
have
marked
there
will
be
meat
and
drink
there
at
night
the
shepherd
will
come
from
the
westwards
he
is
called
david
and
you
may
trust
him
you
must
lie
there
two
weeks
at
least
i
must
have
news
of
the
other
priests
he
said
marjorie
bowed
her
head
i
will
send
a
letter
to
you
by
dick
sampson
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
until
that
i
can
promise
nothing
they
may
have
spies
round
the
house
by
this
time
or
even
earlier
and
i
will
send
in
that
letter
any
news
i
can
get
from
derby
how
shall
i
find
my
way
asked
robin
until
it
is
light
you
will
be
on
ground
that
you
know
she
flushed
slightly
do
you
remember
the
hawking
that
time
after
christmas
it
is
all
across
that
ground
when
daylight
comes
you
can
follow
this
map
she
named
one
or
two
landmarks
pointing
to
them
on
the
map
you
must
have
no
lantern
they
talked
a
few
minutes
longer
as
to
the
way
he
must
go
and
the
provision
that
would
be
ready
for
him
he
must
take
no
mass
requisites
with
him
david
had
made
that
a
condition
then
robin
suddenly
changed
the
subject
had
my
father
any
hand
in
this
affair
at
padley
i
am
certain
he
had
not
they
will
execute
garlick
and
ludlam
will
they
not
she
bowed
her
head
in
assent
the
summer
assizes
open
on
the
eighteenth
she
said
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
how
all
will
go
robin
rose
it
is
time
i
were
in
bed
he
said
if
i
must
ride
at
one
the
two
women
knelt
for
his
blessing
at
one
marjorie
heard
the
horse
brought
round
she
stepped
softly
to
the
window
knowing
herself
to
be
invisible
and
peeped
out
all
was
as
she
had
ordered
there
was
no
light
of
any
kind
she
could
make
out
but
dimly
in
the
summer
darkness
the
two
figures
of
horse
and
groom
as
she
looked
a
third
figure
appeared
beneath
but
there
was
no
word
spoken
that
she
could
hear
this
third
figure
mounted
she
caught
her
breath
as
she
heard
the
horse
scurry
a
little
with
freshness
since
every
sound
seemed
full
of
peril
then
the
mounted
figure
faded
one
way
into
the
dark
and
the
groom
another
ii
it
was
two
weeks
to
the
day
that
robin
received
his
letter
he
had
never
before
been
so
long
in
utter
solitude
for
the
visits
of
david
did
not
break
it
and
for
other
men
he
saw
none
except
a
or
two
in
the
distance
once
or
twice
the
shepherd
came
but
once
a
day
carrying
a
great
jug
and
a
parcel
of
food
and
set
them
down
without
the
hut
he
seemed
to
avoid
even
looking
within
but
merely
took
the
empty
jug
of
the
day
before
and
went
away
again
he
was
an
old
bent
man
with
a
face
like
a
limestone
cliff
grey
and
he
lived
half
the
year
up
here
in
the
wild
peak
country
caring
for
a
few
sheep
and
going
down
to
the
village
not
more
than
once
or
twice
a
week
there
was
a
little
spring
welling
up
in
a
hollow
not
fifty
yards
away
from
the
hut
which
itself
stood
in
a
deep
natural
rift
among
the
high
hills
so
that
men
might
search
for
it
a
lifetime
and
not
come
across
it
robin
daily
round
was
very
simple
he
had
leave
to
make
a
fire
by
day
but
he
must
extinguish
it
at
night
lest
its
glow
should
be
seen
so
he
began
his
morning
by
mixing
a
little
oatmeal
and
then
preparing
his
dinner
about
noon
so
near
as
he
could
judge
by
the
sun
he
dined
sometimes
off
a
partridge
or
rabbit
on
fridays
off
half
a
dozen
tiny
trout
and
set
aside
part
of
the
cold
food
for
supper
he
had
one
good
loaf
of
nearly
black
bread
every
day
and
the
single
jug
of
small
beer
the
greater
part
of
the
day
he
spent
within
the
hut
for
safety
sake
sleeping
a
little
and
thinking
a
good
deal
he
had
no
books
with
him
even
his
breviary
had
been
forbidden
since
david
as
a
shrewd
man
had
made
conditions
first
that
he
should
not
have
to
speak
with
any
refugee
second
that
if
the
man
were
a
priest
he
should
have
nothing
about
him
that
could
prove
him
to
be
so
maine
beads
only
had
been
permitted
on
condition
that
they
were
hidden
always
beneath
a
stone
outside
the
hut
after
nightfall
robin
went
out
to
attend
to
his
horse
that
was
tethered
in
the
next
ravine
over
a
crag
to
shift
his
peg
and
bring
him
a
good
armful
of
cut
grass
and
a
bucket
of
water
the
saddle
and
bridle
were
hidden
beneath
a
couple
of
great
stones
that
leaned
together
not
far
away
after
doing
what
was
necessary
for
his
horse
he
went
to
draw
water
for
himself
and
then
took
his
exercise
avoiding
carefully
according
to
instructions
every
possible
skyline
and
it
was
then
for
the
most
part
that
he
did
his
clear
thinking
he
tried
to
fancy
himself
in
a
fortnight
retreat
such
as
he
had
had
at
rheims
before
his
reception
of
orders
the
evening
of
the
of
july
closed
in
stormy
and
robin
in
an
old
cloak
he
had
found
placed
in
the
hut
for
his
own
use
made
haste
to
attend
to
what
was
necessary
and
hurried
back
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
sat
a
while
listening
to
the
thresh
of
the
rain
and
the
cry
of
the
wind
for
up
here
in
the
high
land
the
full
storm
broke
on
him
the
hut
was
wattled
of
osiers
and
clay
and
kept
out
the
wet
tolerably
well
he
could
see
nothing
from
the
door
of
his
hut
except
the
dim
outline
of
the
nearer
crag
thirty
or
forty
yards
off
and
he
went
presently
to
bed
he
awoke
suddenly
wide
awake
as
is
easy
for
a
man
who
is
sleeping
in
continual
expectation
of
an
alarm
at
the
flash
of
light
in
his
eyes
but
he
was
at
once
reassured
by
dick
voice
i
have
come
sir
and
i
have
brought
the
mistress
letter
robin
sat
up
and
took
the
packet
he
saw
now
that
the
man
carried
a
little
lantern
with
a
slide
over
it
that
allowed
only
a
thin
funnel
of
light
to
escape
that
could
be
shut
off
in
an
instant
all
well
dick
i
did
not
hear
you
coming
the
storm
too
loud
sir
all
well
mistress
manners
thinks
you
had
best
stay
here
a
week
longer
sir
and
and
the
news
it
is
all
in
the
letter
sir
robin
looked
for
the
inscription
but
there
was
none
then
he
broke
the
two
seals
opened
the
paper
and
began
to
read
for
the
next
five
minutes
there
was
no
sound
except
the
thresh
of
the
rain
and
the
cry
of
the
wind
the
letter
ran
as
follows
iii
three
more
have
glorified
god
by
a
good
confession
garlick
ludlam
and
simpson
that
is
the
summary
the
tale
in
detail
hath
been
brought
to
me
by
an
the
trial
went
as
all
thought
it
would
there
was
never
the
least
question
of
it
for
not
only
were
the
two
priests
taken
with
signs
of
their
calling
upon
them
but
both
of
them
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
magistrates
before
there
was
no
shrinking
nor
fear
showed
of
any
kind
but
the
chief
marvel
was
that
these
two
priests
met
with
simpson
in
the
gaol
they
put
them
together
in
one
room
i
think
hoping
that
simpson
would
prevail
upon
them
to
do
as
he
had
promised
to
do
but
by
the
grace
of
god
it
was
all
the
other
way
and
it
was
they
who
prevailed
upon
simpson
to
confess
himself
again
openly
as
a
catholic
this
greatly
enraged
my
lord
shrewsbury
and
the
rest
so
that
there
was
less
hope
than
ever
of
any
respite
and
sentence
was
passed
upon
them
all
together
simpson
showing
at
the
reading
of
it
as
much
courage
as
any
this
was
all
done
two
days
ago
at
the
assizes
and
it
was
that
the
sentence
was
carried
out
they
were
all
three
drawn
on
hurdles
together
to
the
open
space
by
mary
bridge
where
all
was
prepared
with
gallows
and
cauldron
and
butchering
block
and
a
great
company
went
after
them
i
have
not
heard
that
they
spoke
much
on
the
way
except
that
a
friend
of
cried
out
to
him
to
remember
that
they
had
often
shot
off
together
on
the
moors
to
which
garlick
made
answer
merrily
that
it
was
true
but
that
am
now
to
shoot
off
such
a
shot
as
i
never
shot
in
all
my
life
he
was
merry
at
the
trial
too
i
hear
and
said
that
was
not
come
to
seduce
men
but
rather
to
induce
them
to
the
catholic
religion
that
to
this
end
he
had
come
to
the
country
and
for
this
that
he
would
work
so
long
as
he
lived
and
this
he
did
on
the
scaffold
speaking
to
the
crowd
about
him
of
the
salvation
of
their
souls
and
casting
papers
which
he
had
written
in
prison
in
proof
of
the
catholic
faith
garlick
went
up
the
ladder
first
kissing
and
embracing
it
as
the
instrument
of
his
death
and
to
encourage
simpson
as
it
was
thought
since
some
said
he
showed
signs
of
timorousness
again
when
he
came
to
the
place
but
he
showed
none
when
his
turn
came
but
rather
exhibited
the
same
courage
as
them
both
ludlam
stood
by
smiling
while
all
was
done
and
smiling
still
when
his
turn
came
his
last
words
were
benedicti
and
this
he
said
seeming
to
see
a
vision
of
angels
come
to
bear
his
soul
away
they
were
cut
down
all
three
of
them
before
they
were
dead
and
the
butchery
done
on
them
according
to
sentence
yet
none
of
them
cried
out
or
made
the
least
sound
and
their
heads
and
quarters
were
set
up
immediately
afterwards
on
poles
in
divers
places
of
derby
some
of
them
above
the
house
that
stands
on
the
bridge
and
others
on
the
bridge
itself
but
these
i
hear
will
not
be
there
long
so
these
three
have
kept
the
faith
and
finished
their
course
with
joy
john
is
in
ward
for
harbouring
of
the
priests
but
nothing
hath
been
done
to
him
yet
as
for
your
reverence
i
am
of
opinion
that
you
had
best
wait
another
week
where
you
are
there
has
been
a
man
or
two
seen
hereabouts
whom
none
knew
as
well
as
at
padley
it
hath
been
certified
too
that
thomas
was
at
the
root
of
it
all
that
he
gave
the
information
that
john
and
at
least
a
priest
or
two
would
be
at
padley
at
that
time
though
no
man
knows
how
he
knew
it
unless
through
servants
talk
and
since
thomas
knows
your
reverence
it
will
be
better
to
be
hid
for
a
little
longer
so
if
you
will
in
a
week
from
now
i
will
send
dick
once
again
to
tell
you
if
all
be
well
i
look
for
no
letter
back
for
this
since
you
have
nothing
to
write
with
in
the
hut
as
i
know
but
dick
will
tell
me
how
you
do
as
well
as
anything
you
may
choose
to
say
to
him
i
ask
your
reverence
blessing
again
i
do
not
forget
your
reverence
in
my
poor
prayers
and
so
it
ended
without
signature
for
safety
sake
iv
robin
looked
up
when
he
had
finished
to
where
the
faint
outline
of
the
servant
could
be
seen
behind
the
lantern
against
the
greater
darkness
of
the
wall
you
know
of
all
that
has
fallen
at
derby
he
said
with
some
difficulty
yes
sir
well
pray
god
we
may
be
willing
too
if
he
bids
us
to
it
yes
you
had
best
lose
no
time
if
you
are
to
be
home
before
dawn
say
to
mistress
manners
that
i
thank
her
for
her
letter
that
i
praise
god
for
the
graces
she
relates
in
it
and
that
i
will
do
as
she
bids
dick
yes
sir
is
audrey
in
any
of
this
i
do
not
know
sir
i
heard
the
man
voice
hesitated
what
did
you
hear
i
heard
that
my
lord
shrewsbury
wondered
at
his
absence
from
the
trial
and
and
that
a
message
would
be
sent
to
audrey
to
look
to
it
to
be
more
zealous
on
her
grace
commission
that
was
all
yes
sir
then
you
had
best
be
gone
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
bring
me
what
news
you
can
when
you
come
again
dick
sir
god
bless
your
reverence
an
hour
later
with
the
first
coming
of
the
dawn
the
storm
ceased
it
was
that
same
storm
if
he
had
only
known
it
that
had
blown
upon
the
spanish
fleet
at
sea
and
driven
it
towards
destruction
but
of
this
he
knew
nothing
he
had
not
slept
since
dick
had
gone
but
had
lain
on
his
back
on
the
turfed
and
blanketed
bed
in
the
corner
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
thinking
thinking
and
all
that
he
had
read
just
now
he
had
known
it
must
happen
but
there
seemed
to
him
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
an
event
and
its
mere
certainty
the
thing
was
done
out
to
every
bitter
detail
of
the
loathsome
agonizing
death
and
it
had
been
two
of
the
men
whom
he
had
seen
say
mass
after
himself
the
breezy
countryman
yet
anointed
with
the
sealing
oil
and
the
gentle
studious
smiling
man
who
had
been
no
less
vigorous
than
his
friend
but
there
was
one
thing
he
had
not
known
and
that
the
recovery
of
the
faint
heart
which
they
had
inspirited
and
then
in
an
instant
he
remembered
how
he
had
seen
the
three
years
ago
against
the
sunset
as
he
rode
with
anthony
his
mind
was
full
of
the
strange
memory
as
he
came
out
at
last
when
the
black
darkness
began
to
fade
to
grey
and
the
noise
of
the
rain
on
the
roof
had
ceased
and
the
wind
had
fallen
it
was
a
view
of
extraordinary
solemnity
that
he
looked
on
as
he
stood
leaning
against
the
rough
the
night
was
still
stronger
than
day
overhead
was
as
black
as
ever
and
stars
shone
in
it
through
the
dissolving
clouds
that
were
passing
at
last
but
immediately
over
the
grim
serrated
edge
of
the
crag
that
faced
him
to
the
east
a
faint
and
tender
light
was
beginning
to
burn
so
faint
that
as
yet
it
seemed
an
absence
of
black
rather
than
as
of
a
colour
itself
and
in
the
midst
of
it
like
a
crumb
of
diamond
shone
a
single
dying
star
this
high
land
was
as
still
now
as
a
sheltered
valley
a
tuft
of
springy
grass
stood
out
on
the
crag
as
stiff
as
a
thin
plume
and
the
silence
as
at
padley
two
weeks
ago
was
marked
rather
than
broken
by
the
tinkle
of
water
from
his
spring
fifty
yards
away
the
air
was
cold
and
fresh
and
marvellously
scented
after
the
rain
with
the
clean
smell
of
strong
turf
and
rushes
it
was
as
different
from
the
peace
he
had
had
at
padley
as
water
is
different
from
wine
yet
it
was
peace
too
a
confident
and
expectant
peace
that
precedes
the
battle
rather
than
the
rest
which
follows
it
how
was
it
he
had
seen
the
three
men
on
the
moor
as
he
turned
with
anthony
they
were
against
the
crimson
west
as
against
a
glory
the
two
laymen
on
either
side
the
young
priest
in
the
middle
they
had
seemed
to
bear
him
up
and
support
him
the
colour
of
the
sky
was
as
a
stain
of
blood
and
their
shadows
had
stretched
to
his
own
feet
and
there
came
on
him
in
that
hour
one
of
those
vast
experiences
that
can
never
be
told
when
a
flood
rises
in
earth
and
air
that
turns
them
all
to
wine
that
wells
up
through
tired
limbs
and
puzzled
brain
and
beating
heart
and
soothes
and
enkindles
all
in
one
when
it
is
not
a
mere
vision
of
peace
that
draws
the
eyes
up
in
an
ecstasy
of
sight
but
a
bathing
in
it
and
an
envelopment
in
it
of
every
fibre
of
life
when
the
lungs
draw
deep
breaths
of
it
and
the
heart
beats
in
it
and
the
eyes
are
enlightened
by
it
when
the
things
of
earth
become
at
once
eternal
and
fixed
and
of
infinite
value
and
at
the
same
instant
of
less
value
than
the
dust
that
floats
in
space
when
there
no
longer
appears
any
distinction
between
the
finite
and
the
eternal
between
time
and
infinity
when
the
soul
for
that
moment
at
least
finds
that
rest
that
is
the
magnet
and
the
end
of
all
human
striving
and
that
comfort
which
wipes
away
all
tears
chapter
v
i
it
was
the
sixth
night
after
dick
sampson
had
come
back
with
news
of
alban
and
he
had
already
received
instructions
as
to
how
he
was
to
go
hours
later
he
was
to
walk
as
before
starting
after
dark
not
carrying
a
letter
this
time
after
all
in
spite
of
the
news
that
he
might
have
taken
with
him
for
the
priest
would
be
back
before
morning
and
could
hear
it
all
then
at
his
ease
every
possible
cause
of
alarm
had
gone
and
marjorie
for
the
first
time
for
three
weeks
felt
very
nearly
as
content
as
a
year
ago
not
one
more
doubtful
visitor
had
appeared
anywhere
and
now
she
thought
herself
mistaken
even
about
those
solitary
figures
she
had
suspected
before
after
all
they
had
only
been
a
couple
of
men
whose
faces
her
servants
did
not
know
who
had
gone
past
on
the
track
beneath
the
house
one
mounted
and
the
other
on
foot
there
had
been
something
of
a
reaction
too
in
derby
the
deaths
of
the
three
priests
had
made
an
impression
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
biddell
had
written
her
a
letter
on
the
point
saying
that
the
blood
of
those
martyrs
might
well
be
the
peace
if
it
might
not
be
the
seed
of
the
church
in
the
district
men
openly
said
in
the
taverns
he
reported
that
it
was
hard
that
any
should
die
for
religion
merely
politics
were
one
matter
and
religion
another
yet
the
deaths
had
dismayed
the
simple
catholics
too
for
the
present
and
at
hathersage
church
scarcely
ten
miles
away
above
two
hundred
came
to
the
protestant
sermon
preached
before
my
lord
shrewsbury
on
the
first
sunday
after
the
news
of
the
armada
too
had
distracted
men
minds
wonderfully
in
another
direction
news
had
come
in
already
she
was
informed
of
an
engagement
or
two
in
the
english
channel
all
in
favour
of
its
defenders
more
than
that
was
not
known
but
the
beacons
had
blazed
and
the
of
derby
had
echoed
with
the
tramp
of
the
and
it
was
not
likely
that
at
such
a
time
the
attention
of
the
magistrates
would
be
given
to
anything
else
so
her
plans
were
laid
alban
was
to
come
here
for
three
or
four
days
be
provided
with
a
complete
change
of
clothes
all
of
which
she
had
ready
shave
off
his
beard
and
then
set
out
again
for
the
border
he
had
best
go
to
staffordshire
she
thought
for
a
month
or
two
before
beginning
once
more
in
his
own
county
she
went
to
bed
that
night
happy
enough
in
spite
of
the
cause
which
she
loved
so
much
seeming
to
fail
everywhere
it
was
true
that
under
this
last
catastrophe
great
numbers
had
succumbed
but
she
hoped
that
this
would
be
but
for
a
time
let
but
a
few
more
priests
come
from
rheims
to
join
the
company
that
had
lost
so
heavily
and
all
would
be
well
again
so
she
said
to
herself
she
did
not
allow
even
in
her
own
soul
that
the
security
of
her
friend
and
the
thought
that
he
would
be
with
her
in
a
day
or
two
had
any
great
part
in
her
satisfaction
she
awaked
suddenly
at
the
moment
she
did
not
know
what
time
it
was
or
how
long
she
had
slept
but
it
was
still
dark
and
deathly
still
yet
she
could
have
sworn
that
she
had
heard
her
name
called
the
rushlight
was
burned
out
but
in
the
summer
night
she
could
still
make
out
the
outline
of
mistress
alice
bed
yet
all
was
still
there
except
for
the
gentle
breathing
it
could
not
have
been
she
who
had
called
out
in
her
sleep
or
she
would
surely
show
some
signs
of
restlessness
she
sat
up
listening
but
there
was
not
a
sound
she
lay
down
again
and
the
strange
fancy
seized
her
that
it
had
been
her
mother
voice
that
she
had
heard
it
was
in
this
room
that
her
mother
had
died
again
she
sat
up
and
looked
round
all
was
quiet
as
before
the
tall
press
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
glimmered
here
and
there
with
lines
and
points
of
starlight
then
as
again
she
began
to
lie
down
there
came
the
signal
for
which
her
heart
was
expectant
though
her
mind
knew
nothing
of
its
coming
it
was
a
clear
rap
as
of
a
pebble
against
the
glass
she
was
up
and
out
of
bed
in
a
moment
and
was
peering
out
under
the
thick
arch
of
the
little
window
and
a
figure
stood
there
bending
it
seemed
for
another
pebble
in
the
very
place
where
she
had
seen
it
she
thought
nearly
three
weeks
ago
standing
ready
to
mount
a
horse
then
she
was
at
alice
bedside
alice
she
whispered
alice
wake
up
there
is
someone
come
you
must
come
with
me
i
do
not
know
her
voice
faltered
she
knew
that
she
knew
and
fear
clutched
her
by
the
throat
the
porter
was
fast
asleep
and
did
not
move
as
carrying
a
rushlight
she
went
past
the
buttery
with
her
friend
behind
her
saying
no
word
the
bolts
were
well
oiled
and
came
back
with
scarcely
a
sound
then
as
the
door
swung
slowly
back
a
figure
slipped
in
yes
he
said
it
is
i
i
think
i
am
followed
i
have
but
come
come
in
quickly
she
said
and
closed
and
bolted
the
door
once
more
ii
it
was
a
horrible
delight
to
sit
wrapped
in
her
cloak
with
the
hood
over
her
head
listening
to
his
story
in
the
hall
and
to
know
that
it
was
to
her
house
that
he
had
come
for
safety
it
was
horrible
to
her
that
he
needed
it
so
horrible
that
every
shred
of
interior
peace
had
left
her
she
was
composed
only
in
her
speech
and
it
was
a
strange
delight
that
he
had
come
so
simply
he
sat
there
she
could
see
his
outline
and
the
pallor
of
his
face
under
his
hat
and
his
voice
was
perfectly
resolute
and
quiet
this
was
his
tale
twice
this
afternoon
he
said
i
saw
a
man
against
the
sky
opposite
my
hut
it
was
the
same
man
both
times
he
was
not
a
shepherd
or
a
farmer
man
the
night
before
when
david
came
he
did
not
speak
to
me
but
for
the
first
time
he
put
his
head
in
at
the
when
he
brought
the
food
and
made
gestures
that
i
could
not
understand
i
looked
at
him
and
shook
my
head
but
he
would
say
nothing
and
i
remembered
the
bond
and
said
nothing
myself
all
that
he
would
do
was
to
shut
his
eyes
and
wave
his
hands
then
this
last
night
he
brought
no
food
at
all
i
was
uneasy
at
the
sight
of
the
man
too
in
the
afternoon
i
think
he
thought
that
i
was
asleep
for
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
i
was
lying
down
and
looking
at
the
crag
opposite
and
i
saw
him
raise
himself
on
his
hands
against
the
sky
as
if
he
had
been
lying
flat
on
his
face
in
the
heather
i
looked
at
him
for
a
while
and
then
i
flung
my
hand
out
of
bed
suddenly
and
he
was
gone
in
a
whisk
i
went
to
the
door
after
a
time
stretching
myself
as
if
i
were
just
awakened
and
there
was
no
sign
of
him
about
an
hour
before
sunset
i
was
watching
again
and
i
saw
on
a
sudden
a
covey
of
birds
rise
suddenly
about
two
hundred
yards
away
to
the
north
of
the
hut
that
is
by
the
way
that
i
should
have
to
go
down
to
the
valleys
again
they
rose
as
if
they
were
frightened
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
place
and
presently
i
saw
a
man
hat
moving
very
slowly
it
was
the
movement
of
a
man
crawling
on
his
hands
drawing
his
legs
after
him
then
i
waited
for
david
to
come
but
he
did
not
come
and
i
determined
then
to
make
my
way
down
here
as
well
as
i
could
after
dark
if
there
were
any
fellows
after
me
i
should
have
a
better
chance
of
escape
than
if
i
stayed
in
the
hut
i
thought
until
they
could
fetch
up
the
rest
and
if
not
i
could
lose
nothing
by
coming
a
day
too
soon
but
began
the
girl
eagerly
wait
said
robin
quietly
that
is
not
all
i
made
very
poor
way
on
foot
for
i
thought
it
better
to
come
quietly
than
on
a
horse
and
i
went
round
about
again
and
again
in
the
precipitous
ground
so
that
if
there
were
any
after
me
they
could
not
tell
which
way
i
meant
to
go
for
about
two
hours
i
heard
and
saw
nothing
of
any
man
and
i
began
to
think
i
was
a
fool
for
all
my
pains
so
i
sat
down
a
good
while
and
rested
and
even
thought
that
i
would
go
back
again
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
get
up
again
i
heard
a
stone
fall
a
great
way
behind
me
it
was
on
some
rocky
ground
about
two
hundred
yards
away
the
night
was
quite
still
and
i
could
hear
the
stone
very
plainly
it
was
i
that
crawled
then
further
down
the
hill
and
it
was
then
that
i
saw
once
more
a
man
head
move
against
the
stars
i
went
straight
on
then
as
quietly
as
i
could
i
made
sure
that
it
was
but
one
that
was
after
me
and
that
he
would
not
try
to
take
me
by
himself
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
till
i
came
down
near
padley
near
padley
why
i
meant
to
go
there
first
said
the
priest
and
lie
there
till
morning
but
as
i
came
down
the
hill
i
heard
the
steps
of
him
again
a
great
way
off
so
i
turned
sharp
into
a
little
broken
ground
that
lies
there
and
hid
myself
among
the
rocks
mistress
alice
lifted
her
hand
suddenly
hark
she
whispered
then
as
the
three
sat
motionless
there
came
distinct
and
clear
from
a
little
distance
down
the
hill
the
noise
of
two
or
three
horses
walking
over
stony
ground
iii
for
one
deathly
instant
the
two
sat
looking
each
into
the
other
white
face
since
even
the
priest
changed
colour
at
the
sound
while
they
had
talked
the
dawn
had
begun
to
glimmer
and
the
windows
showed
grey
and
ghostly
on
the
thin
morning
mist
then
they
rose
together
marjorie
was
the
first
to
speak
you
must
come
upstairs
at
once
she
said
all
is
ready
there
as
you
know
the
priest
lips
moved
without
speaking
then
he
said
suddenly
i
had
best
be
off
the
back
way
that
is
if
it
is
what
i
think
the
house
will
be
surrounded
but
you
will
have
harboured
me
marjorie
lips
opened
in
a
smile
i
have
done
that
in
any
case
she
said
she
caught
up
the
candle
and
blew
it
out
as
she
went
towards
the
door
come
quickly
she
said
at
the
door
janet
met
them
her
old
face
was
all
distraught
with
fear
she
had
that
moment
run
downstairs
again
on
hearing
the
noise
marjorie
silenced
her
by
a
gesture
the
young
carpenter
had
done
his
work
excellently
and
marjorie
had
taken
care
that
there
had
been
no
neglect
since
the
work
had
been
done
yet
so
short
was
the
time
since
the
hearing
of
the
horses
feet
that
as
the
girl
slipped
out
of
the
press
again
after
drawing
back
the
secret
door
there
came
the
loud
knocking
beneath
for
which
they
had
waited
with
such
agony
quick
she
said
from
within
as
she
waited
came
the
priest
whisper
is
this
to
be
pushed
yes
yes
there
was
the
sound
of
sliding
wood
and
a
little
snap
then
she
closed
the
doors
of
the
press
again
iv
audrey
outside
grew
indignant
and
the
more
so
since
he
was
unhappy
he
had
had
the
message
from
my
lord
shrewsbury
that
a
magistrate
of
her
grace
should
show
more
zeal
and
along
with
this
had
come
a
private
intimation
that
it
was
suspected
that
audrey
had
at
least
once
warned
the
recusants
of
an
approaching
attack
it
would
be
as
well
then
if
he
would
manifest
a
little
activity
but
it
appeared
to
him
the
worst
luck
in
the
world
that
the
hunt
should
lead
him
to
mistress
manners
door
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
that
the
informer
had
made
his
appearance
at
matstead
thirsty
and
dishevelled
with
the
news
that
a
man
thought
to
be
a
popish
priest
was
in
hiding
on
the
moors
that
he
was
being
kept
under
observation
by
another
informer
and
that
it
was
to
be
suspected
that
he
was
the
man
who
had
been
missed
at
padley
when
my
lord
had
taken
garlick
and
ludlam
if
it
were
the
man
it
would
be
the
priest
known
by
the
name
of
alban
the
fellow
whom
my
lord
man
had
so
much
distrusted
at
fotheringay
and
whom
he
had
seen
again
in
derby
a
while
later
next
if
it
were
this
man
he
would
almost
certainly
make
for
padley
if
he
were
disturbed
audrey
had
bitten
his
nails
a
while
as
he
listened
to
this
and
then
had
suddenly
consented
the
plan
suggested
was
simple
enough
one
little
troop
should
ride
to
padley
gathering
reinforcements
on
the
way
and
another
on
foot
should
set
out
for
the
shepherd
hut
then
if
the
priest
should
be
gone
this
second
party
should
come
on
towards
padley
immediately
and
join
forces
with
the
riders
all
this
had
been
done
and
the
mounted
company
led
by
the
magistrate
himself
had
come
up
from
the
valley
in
time
to
see
the
signalling
from
the
heights
contrived
by
the
showing
of
lights
now
and
again
which
indicated
that
the
priest
was
moving
in
the
direction
that
had
been
expected
and
that
one
man
at
least
was
on
his
track
they
had
waited
there
in
the
valley
till
the
intermittent
signals
had
reached
the
level
ground
and
ceased
and
had
then
ridden
up
cautiously
in
time
to
meet
the
informer
companion
and
to
learn
that
the
fugitive
had
doubled
suddenly
back
towards
booth
edge
there
they
had
waited
then
till
the
dawn
was
imminent
and
with
it
there
came
the
party
on
foot
as
had
been
arranged
then
all
together
numbering
about
men
they
had
pushed
on
in
the
direction
of
mistress
manners
house
as
the
house
came
into
view
more
than
ever
audrey
reproached
his
evil
luck
certainly
there
still
were
two
or
three
chances
to
one
that
no
priest
would
be
taken
at
all
since
first
the
man
might
not
be
a
priest
and
next
he
might
have
passed
the
manor
and
plunged
back
again
into
the
hills
but
it
was
not
very
pleasant
work
this
rousing
of
a
house
inhabited
by
a
woman
for
whom
the
magistrate
had
very
far
from
unkindly
feelings
and
on
such
an
errand
so
the
informers
marvelled
at
the
venom
with
which
audrey
occasionally
whispered
at
them
in
the
dark
his
heart
sank
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
light
first
showing
and
then
suddenly
extinguished
in
the
windows
of
the
hall
but
he
was
relieved
to
hear
no
comment
on
it
from
the
men
who
walked
by
his
horse
he
even
hoped
that
they
had
not
seen
it
but
he
must
do
his
duty
he
said
to
himself
he
grew
a
little
warm
and
impatient
when
no
answer
came
to
the
knocking
he
said
such
was
absurd
why
did
not
the
man
come
out
courageously
and
deny
that
he
was
a
priest
he
would
have
a
far
better
excuse
for
letting
him
go
knock
again
he
cried
and
again
the
thunder
rang
through
the
archway
and
the
summons
in
the
queen
name
to
open
then
at
last
a
light
shone
beneath
the
door
it
was
brightening
rapidly
towards
the
dawn
here
in
the
open
air
but
within
it
would
still
be
dark
then
a
voice
grumbled
within
who
is
there
man
bellowed
the
magistrate
open
the
door
and
have
done
with
it
i
tell
you
i
am
a
magistrate
there
was
silence
then
the
voice
came
again
how
do
i
know
that
you
are
audrey
slipped
off
his
horse
scrambled
to
the
door
set
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
open
the
door
you
fool
in
the
queen
name
i
am
audrey
of
matstead
again
came
the
pause
the
magistrate
was
in
the
act
of
turning
to
bid
his
men
beat
the
door
in
when
once
more
the
voice
came
i
tell
the
mistress
sir
she
his
discomfort
grew
on
him
as
he
waited
staring
out
at
the
fast
yellowing
sky
beneath
him
the
slopes
towards
the
valley
and
the
hills
on
the
other
side
appeared
like
a
pencil
drawing
delicate
minute
and
colourless
or
at
the
most
faintly
tinted
in
phantoms
of
their
own
colours
the
sky
too
was
grey
with
the
night
mists
not
yet
dissolved
it
was
an
unneighbourly
action
this
of
his
he
thought
he
must
do
his
best
to
make
it
as
little
offensive
as
he
could
he
turned
to
his
men
now
men
he
said
glaring
like
a
judge
no
violence
here
unless
i
give
the
order
no
breaking
of
aught
in
the
house
the
lady
here
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
the
great
bolts
shot
back
suddenly
he
turned
as
the
door
opened
and
there
pale
as
milk
with
eyes
that
seemed
marjorie
face
was
looking
at
him
she
was
wrapped
in
her
long
cloak
and
her
hood
was
drawn
over
her
head
the
space
behind
was
crowded
with
faces
unrecognizable
in
the
shadow
he
saluted
her
mistress
manners
he
said
i
am
sorry
to
incommode
you
in
this
way
but
a
couple
of
fellows
tell
me
that
a
man
hath
come
this
way
whom
they
think
to
be
a
priest
i
am
a
magistrate
mistress
and
he
stopped
confounded
by
her
face
it
was
not
like
her
face
at
all
the
face
rather
seemed
as
nothing
her
whole
soul
was
in
her
eyes
crying
to
him
some
message
that
he
could
not
understand
it
appeared
impossible
to
him
that
this
was
a
mere
entreaty
that
he
should
leave
one
more
priest
at
liberty
impossible
that
the
mere
shock
and
surprise
should
have
changed
her
so
he
looked
at
her
then
he
began
again
it
is
no
will
of
mine
mistress
beyond
my
duty
but
i
hold
her
commission
she
swept
back
again
motioning
him
to
enter
he
was
astonished
at
his
own
discomfort
but
he
followed
and
his
men
pressed
close
after
and
he
noticed
even
in
that
twilight
that
a
look
of
despair
went
over
the
girl
face
sharp
as
pain
as
she
saw
them
you
have
come
to
search
my
house
sir
she
asked
her
voice
was
as
colourless
as
her
features
my
commission
mistress
compels
me
then
he
noticed
that
the
doors
into
the
hall
had
been
pushed
open
and
that
she
was
moving
towards
them
and
he
thought
he
understood
stand
back
men
he
barked
so
fiercely
that
they
recoiled
this
lady
shall
speak
with
me
first
he
passed
up
the
hall
after
her
he
was
as
unhappy
as
possible
he
wondered
what
she
could
have
to
say
to
him
she
must
surely
understand
that
no
pleading
could
turn
him
he
must
do
his
duty
yet
he
would
certainly
do
this
with
as
little
offence
as
he
could
mistress
manners
he
began
then
she
turned
on
him
again
they
were
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
and
could
speak
low
without
being
overheard
you
must
begone
again
she
whispered
oh
you
must
begone
again
you
do
not
understand
you
her
eyes
still
burned
with
that
terrible
eloquence
it
was
as
the
face
of
one
on
the
rack
mistress
i
can
not
begone
again
i
must
do
my
duty
but
i
promise
you
she
was
close
to
him
staring
into
his
face
he
could
feel
the
heat
of
her
breath
on
his
face
you
must
begone
at
once
she
whispered
still
in
that
voice
of
agony
he
saw
her
begin
to
sway
on
her
feet
and
her
eyes
turn
glassy
he
caught
her
as
she
swayed
here
you
women
he
cried
it
was
all
that
he
could
do
to
force
himself
out
through
the
crowd
of
folks
that
looked
on
him
it
was
not
that
they
barred
his
way
rather
they
shrank
from
him
yet
their
eyes
pulled
and
impeded
him
it
was
by
a
separate
effort
that
he
put
each
foot
before
the
other
behind
he
could
hear
the
long
moan
that
she
had
given
die
into
silence
and
the
chattering
whispers
of
her
women
who
held
her
he
reassured
himself
savagely
he
would
take
care
that
no
one
was
taken
she
would
thank
him
presently
he
would
but
set
guards
at
all
the
doors
and
make
a
cursory
search
he
would
break
a
panel
or
two
no
more
and
that
would
save
both
his
face
and
her
own
yet
he
loathed
even
such
work
as
this
he
turned
abruptly
as
he
came
into
the
buttery
passage
all
the
women
in
the
hall
he
said
sharply
jack
keep
the
door
fast
till
we
are
done
v
he
took
particular
pains
to
do
as
little
damage
as
possible
first
he
went
through
the
himself
with
a
pike
testing
the
haystacks
where
he
was
sure
that
no
man
could
be
hidden
the
beasts
turned
slow
and
ruminating
eyes
upon
him
as
he
went
by
their
stalls
as
he
passed
a
little
later
the
inner
door
into
the
buttery
passage
he
could
hear
the
beating
of
hands
on
the
he
went
on
quickly
to
the
kitchen
hating
himself
yet
determined
to
get
all
done
quickly
and
drove
the
who
was
crouching
by
the
unlighted
fire
out
behind
him
sending
a
man
with
her
to
bestow
her
in
the
hall
she
wailed
as
she
went
by
him
but
it
was
unintelligible
and
he
was
in
no
mood
for
listening
take
her
in
he
said
but
let
no
one
out
nor
a
message
till
all
is
done
he
thought
that
the
kinder
course
then
at
last
he
went
upstairs
still
with
his
little
bodyguard
of
four
of
whom
one
was
the
man
who
had
followed
the
fugitive
down
from
the
hills
he
began
with
the
little
rooms
over
the
hall
a
bedstead
stood
in
one
in
another
was
a
table
all
piled
with
linen
a
third
had
its
floor
covered
with
early
autumn
fruit
ready
for
preserving
he
struck
on
a
panel
or
two
as
he
went
for
form
sake
as
he
came
out
again
he
turned
savagely
on
the
informer
it
is
damned
nonsense
he
said
the
fellow
not
here
at
all
i
told
you
he
have
gone
back
to
the
hills
the
man
looked
up
at
him
with
a
furtive
kind
of
sneer
in
his
face
he
too
was
angry
enough
the
loss
of
the
priest
meant
the
loss
of
the
heavy
reward
we
have
not
searched
a
room
rightly
yet
sir
he
snarled
there
are
a
hundred
places
not
searched
you
villain
why
what
would
you
have
it
not
the
manner
i
done
it
before
sir
a
here
and
a
blow
there
i
tell
you
i
will
not
have
the
house
injured
mistress
manners
very
good
sir
your
honour
is
the
magistrate
i
am
not
the
old
man
temper
boiled
over
they
were
passing
at
that
instant
a
door
and
within
he
could
see
a
bare
little
parlour
with
linen
presses
against
the
walls
it
would
not
hide
a
cat
do
you
search
then
he
cried
here
then
and
i
will
watch
you
but
you
shall
pay
for
any
wanton
damage
i
tell
you
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
is
the
use
then
he
began
bah
search
then
as
you
will
i
will
pay
the
noise
from
the
hall
had
ceased
altogether
as
the
four
men
went
into
the
parlour
it
was
a
plain
little
room
with
an
open
fireplace
and
a
great
settle
beside
it
there
were
hangings
here
and
there
that
over
the
hearth
presented
icarus
in
the
chariot
of
the
sun
it
seemed
such
a
place
as
that
in
which
two
lovers
might
sit
and
talk
together
at
sunset
in
one
place
hung
a
dark
oil
painting
the
old
man
went
across
to
the
window
and
stared
out
the
sun
was
up
by
now
far
away
out
of
sight
and
the
whole
sunlit
valley
lay
stretched
beneath
beyond
the
slopes
that
led
down
to
padley
the
loathing
for
his
work
rose
up
again
and
choked
him
this
desperate
bullying
of
a
few
women
and
all
to
no
purpose
he
stared
out
at
the
horses
beneath
and
at
the
couple
of
men
gossiping
together
at
their
heads
he
determined
to
see
mistress
manners
again
alone
presently
when
she
should
be
recovered
and
have
a
word
with
her
in
private
she
would
forgive
him
perhaps
when
she
saw
him
ride
off
as
he
most
certainly
meant
to
do
he
thought
too
of
other
things
this
old
man
as
he
stood
with
his
shoulders
squared
resolute
in
his
lack
of
attention
to
the
mean
work
going
on
behind
him
he
wondered
whether
god
were
angry
or
no
whether
this
kind
of
duty
were
according
to
his
will
down
there
was
padley
where
he
had
heard
mass
in
the
old
days
padley
where
the
two
priests
had
been
taken
a
few
weeks
ago
he
wondered
if
it
please
your
honour
we
will
break
in
this
panel
came
the
smooth
sneering
voice
that
he
loathed
he
turned
sullenly
they
were
opposite
the
old
picture
beneath
it
there
showed
a
crack
in
the
wainscoting
he
could
scarcely
refuse
leave
besides
the
woodwork
was
flawed
in
any
case
he
would
pay
for
a
new
panel
himself
there
is
nothing
there
he
said
doubtfully
oh
no
sir
said
the
man
with
a
peculiar
look
it
is
but
to
make
a
show
the
old
man
brows
came
down
angrily
then
he
nodded
and
leaning
against
the
window
watched
them
one
of
his
own
men
came
forward
with
a
hammer
and
chisel
he
placed
the
chisel
at
the
edge
of
the
cracked
panel
where
the
informer
directed
and
struck
a
blow
or
two
there
was
the
unmistakable
dull
sound
of
wood
against
stone
not
an
echo
of
resonance
the
old
man
smiled
grimly
to
himself
the
man
must
be
a
fool
if
he
thought
there
could
be
any
hole
there
well
he
would
let
them
do
what
they
would
here
and
then
forbid
any
further
damage
he
wondered
if
the
priest
really
were
in
the
house
or
no
the
two
men
had
their
heads
together
now
eyeing
the
crack
they
had
made
then
the
informer
said
something
in
a
low
voice
that
the
old
man
could
not
hear
and
the
other
handing
him
the
chisel
and
hammer
went
out
of
the
room
beckoning
to
one
of
the
two
others
that
stood
waiting
at
the
door
well
sneered
the
old
man
have
you
caught
your
bird
not
yet
sir
he
could
hear
the
steps
of
the
others
in
the
next
room
and
then
silence
what
are
they
doing
there
he
asked
suddenly
nothing
sir
i
just
bade
a
man
wait
on
that
side
the
man
was
once
more
inserting
the
chisel
in
the
top
of
the
wainscoting
then
he
presently
began
to
drive
it
down
with
the
hammer
as
if
to
detach
it
from
the
wall
suddenly
he
stopped
and
at
the
same
instant
the
old
man
heard
some
faint
muffled
noise
as
of
footsteps
moving
either
in
the
wall
or
beyond
it
what
is
that
the
man
said
nothing
he
appeared
to
be
listening
what
is
that
demanded
the
other
again
with
a
strange
uneasiness
at
his
heart
was
it
possible
after
all
then
the
man
dropped
his
chisel
and
hammer
and
darted
out
and
vanished
a
sudden
noise
of
voices
and
tramplings
broke
out
somewhere
out
of
sight
god
blood
roared
the
old
man
in
anger
and
dismay
i
believe
they
have
the
poor
devil
he
ran
out
two
steps
down
the
passage
and
in
again
at
the
door
of
the
next
room
it
was
a
bedroom
with
two
beds
side
by
side
a
great
press
with
open
doors
stood
between
the
hearth
and
the
window
and
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
five
men
struggled
and
swayed
together
the
fifth
was
a
bearded
young
man
well
dressed
but
he
could
not
see
his
face
then
they
had
him
tight
his
hands
were
twisted
behind
his
back
an
arm
was
flung
round
his
neck
and
another
man
crouching
had
his
legs
embraced
he
cried
out
once
or
twice
the
old
man
turned
sick
a
great
rush
of
blood
seemed
to
be
hammering
in
his
ears
and
dilating
his
eyes
he
ran
forward
tearing
at
the
arm
that
was
choking
the
prisoner
throat
and
screaming
he
knew
not
what
and
it
was
then
that
he
knew
for
certain
that
this
was
his
son
chapter
vi
i
robin
drew
a
long
breath
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
then
he
went
forward
to
the
table
and
sat
on
it
swinging
his
feet
and
looking
carefully
and
curiously
round
the
room
so
far
as
the
darkness
would
allow
him
his
eyes
had
had
scarcely
time
yet
to
become
accustomed
to
the
change
from
the
brilliant
sunshine
outside
to
the
gloom
of
the
prison
it
was
his
first
experience
of
prison
and
for
the
present
he
was
more
interested
than
subdued
by
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
lifetime
had
passed
since
the
early
morning
up
in
the
hills
when
he
had
attempted
to
escape
by
the
bedroom
and
had
been
seized
as
he
came
out
of
the
press
of
course
he
had
fought
it
was
his
right
and
his
duty
and
he
had
not
known
the
utter
uselessness
of
it
in
that
guarded
house
he
had
known
nothing
of
what
was
going
forward
he
had
heard
the
entrance
of
the
searchers
below
and
now
and
again
their
footsteps
then
he
had
seen
the
wainscoting
begin
to
gape
before
him
and
had
understood
that
his
only
chance
was
by
the
way
he
had
entered
then
as
he
had
caught
sight
of
his
father
he
had
ceased
his
struggles
he
had
not
said
one
word
to
him
the
shock
was
complete
and
unexpected
he
had
seen
the
old
man
stagger
back
and
sink
on
the
bed
then
he
had
been
hurried
from
the
room
and
downstairs
as
the
party
came
into
the
buttery
entrance
there
had
been
a
great
clamour
the
man
on
guard
at
the
hall
doors
had
run
forward
the
doors
had
opened
suddenly
and
marjorie
had
come
out
with
a
surge
of
faces
behind
her
but
to
her
too
he
had
said
nothing
he
had
tried
to
smile
he
was
still
faint
and
sick
from
the
fight
upstairs
but
he
had
been
pushed
out
into
the
air
where
he
saw
the
horses
waiting
and
round
the
corner
of
the
house
into
an
and
there
he
had
had
time
to
recover
it
was
strange
how
little
religion
had
come
to
his
aid
during
that
hour
of
waiting
and
indeed
during
the
long
and
weary
ride
to
derby
he
had
tried
to
pray
but
he
had
had
no
consolation
such
as
he
supposed
must
surely
come
to
all
who
suffered
for
christ
it
had
been
instead
the
tiny
things
that
absorbed
his
attention
the
bundle
of
hay
in
the
corner
an
ancient
the
heads
of
his
guards
outside
the
little
barred
window
the
sound
of
their
voices
talking
later
when
a
man
had
come
out
from
the
house
and
looked
in
at
his
door
telling
him
that
they
must
start
in
ten
minutes
and
giving
him
a
hunch
of
bread
to
eat
it
had
been
the
way
the
man
eyebrows
grew
over
his
nose
and
the
creases
of
his
felt
hat
to
which
he
gave
his
mind
somewhere
far
beneath
in
himself
he
knew
that
there
were
other
considerations
and
memories
and
movements
that
were
even
fears
and
hopes
and
desires
but
he
could
not
come
at
these
he
was
as
a
man
struggling
to
dive
held
up
on
the
surface
by
sheets
of
cork
he
knew
that
his
father
was
in
that
house
that
it
was
his
father
who
had
been
the
means
of
taking
him
that
marjorie
was
there
yet
these
facts
were
as
tales
read
in
a
book
so
too
with
his
faith
his
lips
repeated
words
now
and
then
but
god
was
as
far
from
him
and
as
inconceivably
unreal
as
is
the
thought
of
sunshine
and
a
garden
to
a
miner
freezing
painlessly
in
the
dark
in
the
same
state
he
was
led
out
again
presently
and
set
on
a
horse
and
while
a
man
attached
one
foot
to
the
other
by
a
cord
beneath
the
horse
belly
he
looked
like
a
child
at
the
arched
doorway
of
the
house
at
a
patch
of
lichen
that
was
beginning
to
spread
above
the
lintel
at
the
open
window
of
the
room
above
he
vaguely
desired
to
speak
with
marjorie
again
he
even
asked
the
man
who
was
tying
his
feet
whether
he
might
do
so
but
he
got
no
answer
a
group
of
men
watched
him
from
the
door
and
he
noticed
that
they
were
silent
he
wondered
if
it
were
the
tying
of
his
feet
in
which
they
were
so
much
absorbed
little
by
little
as
they
rode
this
oppression
began
to
lift
half
a
dozen
times
he
determined
to
speak
with
the
man
who
rode
beside
him
and
held
his
horse
by
a
leading
rein
and
each
time
he
did
not
speak
neither
did
any
man
speak
to
him
another
man
rode
behind
and
a
dozen
or
so
went
on
foot
he
could
hear
them
talking
together
in
low
voices
he
was
finally
roused
by
his
companion
speaking
he
had
noticed
the
man
look
at
him
now
and
again
strangely
and
not
unkindly
is
it
true
that
you
are
a
son
of
audrey
sir
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
yes
when
his
mind
seemed
to
come
back
to
him
as
clear
as
an
awakening
from
sleep
he
understood
that
he
must
not
identify
himself
if
he
could
help
it
he
had
been
told
at
rheims
that
silence
was
best
in
such
matters
mr
audrey
he
said
the
magistrate
the
man
nodded
he
did
not
seem
an
unkindly
personage
at
all
then
he
smiled
well
well
he
said
less
said
he
broke
off
and
began
to
whistle
then
he
interrupted
himself
once
more
he
was
still
in
his
fit
he
said
when
we
came
away
mistress
manners
was
with
him
intelligence
was
flowing
back
in
robin
brain
like
a
tide
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
perceived
things
with
an
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
he
understood
he
must
show
no
dismay
or
horror
of
any
kind
he
must
carry
himself
easily
and
detachedly
in
a
fit
was
he
the
other
nodded
i
am
arrested
on
his
warrant
then
and
on
what
charge
the
man
laughed
outright
that
too
good
he
said
why
we
have
a
bundle
of
popery
on
the
horse
behind
it
was
all
in
the
i
am
supposed
to
be
a
priest
then
said
robin
with
admirable
disdain
again
the
man
laughed
they
will
have
some
trouble
in
proving
that
said
robin
viciously
he
learned
presently
whither
they
were
going
he
was
right
in
thinking
it
to
be
derby
there
he
was
to
be
handed
over
to
the
gaoler
the
trial
would
probably
come
on
at
the
michaelmas
assizes
five
or
six
weeks
hence
he
would
have
leave
to
communicate
with
a
lawyer
when
he
was
once
safely
bestowed
there
but
whether
or
no
his
lawyer
or
any
other
visitors
would
be
admitted
to
him
was
a
matter
for
the
magistrates
they
ate
as
they
rode
and
reached
derby
in
the
afternoon
at
the
very
outskirts
the
peculiar
nature
of
this
cavalcade
was
observed
and
by
the
time
that
they
came
within
sight
of
the
a
considerable
mob
was
hustling
along
on
all
sides
there
were
a
few
cries
raised
robin
could
not
distinguish
the
words
but
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
some
were
raised
for
him
as
well
as
against
him
he
kept
his
head
somewhat
down
he
thought
it
better
to
risk
no
complications
that
might
arise
should
he
be
recognised
as
they
drew
nearer
the
the
progress
became
yet
slower
for
the
crowd
seemed
suddenly
and
abnormally
swelled
there
was
a
great
shouting
of
voices
too
in
front
and
the
smell
of
burning
came
distinctly
on
the
breeze
the
man
riding
beside
robin
turned
his
head
and
called
out
and
in
answer
one
of
the
others
riding
behind
pushed
his
horse
up
level
with
the
other
two
so
that
the
prisoner
had
a
guard
on
either
side
a
few
steps
further
and
another
order
was
issued
followed
by
the
pressing
up
of
the
men
that
went
on
foot
so
as
to
form
a
complete
square
about
the
three
riders
robin
put
a
question
but
the
men
gave
him
no
answer
he
could
see
that
they
were
preoccupied
and
anxious
then
as
step
by
step
they
made
their
way
forward
and
gained
the
corner
of
the
he
saw
the
reason
of
these
precautions
for
the
whole
square
was
one
pack
of
heads
except
where
somewhere
in
the
midst
a
great
bonfire
blazed
in
the
sunlight
the
noise
too
was
deafening
drums
were
beating
horns
blowing
men
shouting
aloud
from
window
after
window
leaned
heads
and
as
the
party
advanced
yet
further
they
came
suddenly
in
view
of
a
scaffold
hung
with
gay
carpets
and
ribbons
on
which
a
civil
dignitary
in
some
official
dress
was
gesticulating
it
was
useless
to
ask
a
question
not
a
word
could
have
been
heard
unless
it
were
shouted
aloud
and
presently
the
din
redoubled
for
out
of
sight
round
some
corner
guns
were
suddenly
shot
off
one
after
another
and
the
cheering
grew
shrill
and
piercing
in
contrast
as
they
came
out
at
last
without
attracting
any
great
attention
into
the
more
open
space
at
the
entrance
of
friar
gate
robin
turned
again
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
it
was
plainly
not
himself
as
he
had
at
first
almost
believed
the
man
turned
an
exultant
face
to
him
it
the
spanish
fleet
he
said
there
not
a
ship
of
it
left
they
say
when
they
halted
at
the
gate
of
the
prison
there
was
another
pause
while
the
cord
that
tied
his
feet
was
cut
and
he
was
helped
from
his
horse
as
he
was
stiff
and
constrained
from
the
long
ride
under
such
circumstances
he
heard
a
roar
of
interest
and
abuse
and
perhaps
a
little
sympathy
from
the
part
of
the
crowd
that
had
followed
as
the
gate
close
behind
him
ii
as
his
eyes
became
better
accustomed
to
the
dark
he
began
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
it
was
in
which
he
found
himself
it
was
a
square
little
room
on
the
with
a
single
window
against
which
the
dirt
had
collected
in
such
quantities
as
to
exclude
almost
all
light
the
floor
was
beaten
earth
damp
and
uneven
the
walls
were
built
of
stones
and
timber
and
were
dripping
with
moisture
there
was
a
table
and
a
stool
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
a
dark
heap
in
the
corner
he
examined
this
presently
and
found
it
to
be
rotting
hay
covered
with
some
kind
of
rug
the
whole
place
smelled
hideously
foul
from
far
away
outside
came
still
the
noise
of
cheering
heard
as
through
wool
and
the
sharp
reports
of
the
cannon
they
were
still
firing
the
armada
seemed
very
remote
from
him
here
in
ward
its
destruction
affected
him
now
hardly
at
all
except
for
the
worse
since
an
reaction
might
very
well
follow
he
set
himself
with
scarcely
an
effort
to
contemplate
more
personal
matters
he
was
astonished
that
his
purse
had
not
been
taken
from
him
he
had
been
searched
rapidly
just
now
in
an
outer
passage
by
a
couple
of
men
one
of
whom
he
understood
to
be
his
gaoler
and
a
knife
and
a
chain
and
his
rosary
had
been
taken
from
him
but
the
purse
had
been
put
back
again
he
remembered
presently
that
the
possession
of
money
made
a
considerable
difference
to
a
prisoner
comfort
but
he
determined
to
do
as
little
as
he
was
obliged
in
this
way
he
might
need
the
money
more
urgently
by
and
by
by
the
time
that
he
had
gone
carefully
round
his
even
reaching
up
to
the
window
and
testing
the
bars
pushing
as
noiselessly
as
he
could
against
the
door
pacing
the
distances
in
every
direction
he
had
at
the
same
time
once
more
arranged
and
rehearsed
every
piece
of
evidence
that
he
possessed
and
formed
a
number
of
resolutions
he
was
perfectly
clear
by
now
that
his
father
had
been
wholly
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
the
man
he
was
after
the
horror
in
the
gasping
face
that
he
had
seen
so
close
to
his
own
above
the
strangling
arm
set
that
beyond
a
doubt
the
news
of
the
fit
into
which
his
father
had
fallen
confirmed
it
next
he
had
been
right
in
believing
himself
watched
in
the
hut
and
followed
down
from
it
this
hiding
of
his
in
the
hills
the
discovery
of
him
in
the
together
with
the
vestments
these
two
things
were
the
heaviest
pieces
of
testimony
against
him
more
remote
testimony
might
be
brought
forward
from
his
earlier
adventures
his
presence
at
fotheringay
his
recognition
by
my
man
but
these
were
in
themselves
indifferent
his
resolutions
were
few
and
simple
he
would
behave
himself
quietly
in
all
ways
he
would
make
no
demand
to
see
anyone
since
he
knew
that
whatever
was
possible
would
be
done
for
him
by
marjorie
he
would
deny
nothing
and
assert
very
little
if
he
were
brought
before
the
magistrates
finally
he
would
say
if
he
could
a
dry
mass
every
day
and
observe
the
hours
of
prayer
so
far
as
he
could
he
had
no
books
with
him
of
any
kind
but
he
could
pray
god
for
fortitude
then
he
knelt
down
on
the
earth
floor
and
said
his
first
prayer
in
prison
the
prayer
that
had
rung
so
often
in
his
mind
since
mary
herself
had
prayed
it
aloud
on
the
scaffold
and
bourgoign
had
repeated
it
to
him
as
thy
arms
o
christ
were
extended
on
the
cross
even
so
receive
me
into
the
arms
of
thy
mercy
and
blot
out
all
my
sins
with
thy
most
precious
blood
chapter
vii
i
there
was
a
vast
crowd
in
the
at
michaelmas
to
see
the
judges
come
partly
because
there
was
always
excitement
at
the
visible
majesty
of
the
law
partly
because
the
tale
of
one
at
least
of
the
prisoners
had
roused
interest
it
was
a
dramatic
tale
he
was
first
a
seminary
priest
and
a
derbyshire
man
many
remembered
him
riding
as
a
little
lad
beside
his
father
he
was
next
a
runaway
to
rheims
for
religion
sake
when
his
father
conformed
third
he
had
been
taken
in
the
house
of
mistress
manners
to
whom
report
said
he
had
once
been
betrothed
last
he
had
been
taken
by
his
father
himself
all
this
furnished
matter
for
a
quantity
of
conversation
in
the
taverns
and
it
was
freely
discussed
by
the
sentimental
whether
or
no
if
the
priest
yielded
and
conformed
he
would
yet
find
mistress
manners
willing
to
wed
him
signs
of
the
armada
rejoicings
still
survived
in
the
as
the
judges
rode
in
streamers
hung
in
the
sunshine
rather
bedraggled
after
so
long
from
the
roof
and
pillars
of
the
guildhall
and
a
great
patch
between
the
conduit
and
the
cross
marked
where
the
ox
had
been
roasted
there
was
a
deal
of
loyal
cheering
as
the
procession
went
by
for
these
splendid
personages
on
horseback
stood
to
the
mob
for
the
power
that
had
repelled
the
enemies
of
england
and
her
grace
name
was
received
with
enthusiasm
behind
the
judges
and
their
escort
came
a
cavalcade
of
riders
gentlemen
grooms
servants
and
agents
of
all
sorts
but
not
a
derby
man
noticed
or
recognised
a
thin
gentleman
who
rode
modestly
in
the
midst
with
a
couple
of
personal
servants
on
either
side
of
him
it
was
not
until
the
visitors
had
separated
to
the
various
houses
and
inns
where
they
were
to
be
lodged
and
the
mob
was
dispersing
home
again
that
it
began
to
be
rumoured
everywhere
that
topcliffe
was
come
again
to
derby
on
a
special
mission
ii
the
tidings
came
to
marjorie
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
in
biddell
parlour
and
listened
to
the
last
shoutings
she
had
been
in
town
now
three
days
ever
since
the
capture
she
had
been
under
guard
in
her
own
house
till
three
days
ago
four
men
had
been
billeted
upon
her
not
indeed
by
the
orders
of
audrey
since
audrey
was
in
no
condition
to
control
affairs
any
longer
but
by
the
direction
of
columbell
who
had
himself
ridden
out
to
take
charge
at
booth
edge
when
the
news
of
the
arrest
had
come
with
the
prisoner
himself
to
the
city
it
was
he
too
who
had
seen
to
the
removal
of
audrey
a
week
later
when
he
had
recovered
from
the
weakness
caused
by
the
fit
sufficiently
to
travel
as
far
as
derby
for
it
was
thought
better
that
the
magistrate
who
had
effected
the
capture
should
be
accessible
to
the
examining
magistrates
it
was
of
course
lamentable
said
columbell
that
father
and
son
should
have
been
brought
into
such
relations
and
he
would
do
all
that
he
could
to
relieve
audrey
from
any
painful
task
in
which
they
could
do
without
him
but
her
grace
business
must
be
done
and
he
had
had
special
messages
from
my
lord
shrewsbury
himself
that
the
prisoner
must
be
dealt
with
sternly
it
was
believed
wrote
my
lord
that
alban
as
he
called
himself
had
a
good
deal
more
against
him
than
the
mere
fact
of
being
a
seminary
priest
it
was
thought
that
he
had
been
involved
in
the
babington
plot
and
had
at
least
once
had
access
to
the
queen
of
the
scots
since
the
fortunate
failure
of
the
conspiracy
all
this
then
marjorie
knew
from
biddell
who
seemed
always
to
know
everything
but
it
was
not
until
the
evening
on
which
the
judges
arrived
that
she
learned
the
last
and
extreme
measures
that
would
be
taken
to
establish
these
suspicions
she
had
ridden
openly
to
derby
so
soon
as
the
news
came
from
there
that
for
the
present
she
might
be
set
at
liberty
the
lawyer
came
into
the
darkening
room
as
the
square
outside
began
to
grow
quiet
and
marjorie
opened
her
eyes
to
see
who
it
was
he
said
nothing
at
first
but
sat
down
close
beside
her
he
knew
she
must
be
told
but
he
hated
the
telling
he
carried
a
little
paper
in
his
hand
he
would
begin
with
that
little
bit
of
good
news
first
he
said
to
himself
well
mistress
he
said
i
have
the
order
at
last
we
are
to
see
him
it
is
biddell
and
a
friend
she
sat
up
and
a
little
vitality
came
back
to
her
face
for
a
moment
she
almost
looked
as
she
had
looked
in
the
early
summer
she
said
and
when
he
will
not
be
brought
before
my
lords
for
three
or
four
days
yet
there
is
a
number
of
cases
to
come
before
his
it
will
give
us
those
two
or
three
days
at
least
to
prepare
our
case
he
spoke
heavily
and
dejectedly
up
to
the
present
he
had
been
utterly
refused
permission
to
see
his
client
and
though
he
knew
the
outlines
of
the
affair
well
enough
he
knew
very
little
of
the
thousand
details
on
which
the
priest
would
ask
his
advice
it
was
a
hopeless
affair
it
appeared
to
the
lawyer
in
any
case
and
now
with
this
last
piece
of
tidings
he
knew
that
there
was
indeed
nothing
to
be
said
except
words
of
encouragement
he
listened
with
the
same
heavy
air
to
mistress
manners
as
she
said
a
word
or
two
as
to
what
must
be
spoken
of
to
robin
she
was
very
quiet
and
collected
and
talked
to
the
point
but
he
said
nothing
what
is
the
matter
sir
she
said
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
hers
there
was
still
enough
light
from
the
windows
for
him
to
see
her
eyes
and
that
there
was
a
spark
in
them
that
had
not
been
there
just
now
and
it
was
for
him
to
extinguish
it
he
gripped
his
courage
i
have
had
worse
news
than
all
he
said
her
lips
moved
and
a
vibration
went
over
her
face
her
eyes
blinked
as
at
a
sudden
light
yes
he
put
his
hand
tenderly
on
her
arm
you
must
be
courageous
he
said
it
is
the
worst
news
that
ever
came
to
me
it
concerns
one
who
is
come
from
london
and
rode
in
with
my
lords
she
could
not
speak
but
her
great
eyes
entreated
him
to
finish
her
misery
yes
he
said
still
pressing
his
hand
on
to
her
arm
yes
it
is
topcliffe
who
is
come
he
felt
the
soft
muscles
harden
like
steel
there
was
no
sound
except
the
voices
talking
in
the
square
and
the
noise
of
footsteps
across
the
pavements
he
could
not
look
at
her
then
he
heard
her
draw
a
long
breath
and
breathe
it
out
again
and
her
taut
muscles
relaxed
we
we
are
all
in
christ
hands
she
said
we
must
tell
him
iii
it
appeared
to
the
girl
as
if
she
were
moving
on
a
kind
of
set
stage
with
every
movement
and
incident
designed
beforehand
in
a
play
that
was
itself
a
kind
of
destiny
above
all
when
she
went
at
last
into
cell
and
saw
him
standing
there
and
found
it
to
be
that
in
which
so
long
ago
she
had
talked
with
thomas
fitzherbert
the
great
realities
were
closing
round
her
as
irresistible
as
wheels
and
bars
there
was
scarcely
a
period
in
her
life
scarcely
a
voluntary
action
of
hers
for
good
or
evil
that
did
not
furnish
some
part
of
this
vast
machine
in
whose
grip
both
she
and
her
friend
were
held
so
fast
no
calculation
on
her
part
could
have
contrived
so
complete
a
climax
yet
hardly
a
calculation
that
had
not
gone
astray
from
that
end
to
which
she
had
designed
it
it
was
as
if
some
monstrous
and
ironical
power
had
been
beneath
and
about
her
all
her
life
long
using
those
thoughts
and
actions
that
she
had
intended
in
one
way
to
the
development
of
another
first
it
was
she
that
had
first
turned
her
friend
mind
to
the
life
of
a
priest
had
she
submitted
to
natural
causes
she
would
have
been
his
wife
nine
years
ago
they
would
have
been
harassed
no
doubt
and
troubled
but
no
more
it
was
she
again
that
had
encouraged
his
return
to
derbyshire
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
and
for
the
efforts
she
had
made
to
do
what
she
thought
good
work
for
god
he
might
have
been
sent
elsewhere
it
was
in
her
house
that
he
had
been
taken
and
in
the
very
place
she
had
designed
for
his
safety
if
she
had
but
sent
him
on
as
he
wished
back
to
the
hills
again
he
might
never
have
been
taken
at
all
these
and
a
score
of
other
thoughts
had
raced
continually
through
her
mind
she
felt
even
as
if
she
were
responsible
for
the
manner
of
his
taking
and
for
the
horror
that
it
had
been
his
father
who
had
accomplished
it
if
she
had
said
more
or
less
in
the
hall
of
that
dark
morning
if
she
had
not
swooned
if
she
had
said
bravely
it
is
your
son
sir
who
is
here
all
might
have
been
saved
and
now
it
was
topcliffe
who
was
come
and
she
knew
all
that
this
signified
the
very
man
at
whose
mere
bodily
presence
she
had
sickened
in
the
court
of
the
tower
and
last
it
was
she
who
had
to
tell
robin
of
this
so
tremendous
however
had
been
the
weight
of
these
thoughts
upon
her
crowned
and
clinched
so
to
say
by
finding
that
the
priest
was
even
in
the
same
cell
as
that
in
which
she
had
visited
the
traitor
that
there
was
no
room
any
more
for
bitterness
even
as
she
waited
with
biddell
behind
her
as
the
gaoler
fumbled
with
the
keys
she
was
aware
that
the
last
breath
of
resentment
had
been
drawn
it
was
indeed
a
monstrous
power
that
had
so
dealt
with
her
it
was
none
other
than
the
will
of
god
plain
at
last
she
knelt
down
for
the
priest
blessing
without
speaking
as
the
door
closed
and
biddell
knelt
behind
her
then
she
rose
and
went
forward
to
the
stool
and
sat
upon
it
he
was
hardly
changed
at
all
he
looked
a
little
white
and
drawn
in
the
wavering
light
of
the
flambeau
but
his
clothes
were
orderly
and
clean
and
his
eyes
as
bright
and
resolute
as
ever
it
is
a
great
happiness
to
see
you
he
said
smiling
and
then
no
more
compliments
and
what
of
my
father
he
added
instantly
she
told
him
audrey
was
in
derby
still
sick
from
his
fit
he
was
in
columbell
house
she
had
not
seen
him
robin
she
said
and
she
used
the
old
name
utterly
unknowing
that
she
did
so
we
must
speak
with
biddell
presently
about
your
case
but
there
is
a
word
or
two
i
have
to
say
first
we
can
have
two
hours
here
if
you
wish
it
robin
put
his
hands
behind
him
on
to
the
table
and
jumped
lightly
so
that
he
sat
on
it
facing
her
if
you
will
not
sit
on
the
table
biddell
i
fear
there
is
only
that
block
of
wood
he
pointed
to
a
block
of
a
tree
set
on
end
it
served
him
laid
flat
as
a
pillow
the
lawyer
went
across
to
it
the
judges
i
hear
are
come
said
the
priest
she
bowed
yes
but
your
case
will
not
be
up
for
three
or
four
days
yet
why
then
i
shall
have
time
she
lifted
her
hand
sharply
a
little
to
check
him
you
will
not
have
much
time
she
said
and
paused
again
a
sharp
contraction
came
and
went
in
the
muscles
of
her
throat
it
was
as
if
a
band
gripped
her
there
relaxed
and
gripped
again
she
put
up
her
own
hand
desperately
to
tear
at
her
collar
why
but
began
the
priest
she
could
bear
it
no
more
his
resolute
cheerfulness
his
frank
astonishment
were
like
knives
to
her
she
gave
one
cry
topcliffe
is
come
topcliffe
she
cried
then
she
flung
her
arm
across
the
table
and
dropped
her
face
on
it
no
tears
came
from
her
eyes
but
tearing
sobs
shook
and
tormented
her
it
was
quite
quiet
after
she
had
spoken
even
in
her
anguish
she
knew
that
the
priest
did
not
stir
from
where
he
sat
a
couple
of
feet
away
only
the
swinging
of
his
feet
ceased
she
drove
down
her
convulsions
they
rose
again
she
drove
them
down
once
more
then
the
tears
surged
up
her
whole
being
relaxed
and
she
felt
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
marjorie
said
the
grave
voice
as
steady
as
it
had
ever
been
marjorie
this
is
what
we
looked
for
is
it
not
topcliffe
is
come
is
he
well
let
him
come
he
or
another
it
is
for
this
that
we
have
all
looked
since
the
beginning
christ
his
grace
is
strong
enough
is
it
not
it
hath
been
strong
enough
for
many
at
least
and
he
will
not
surely
take
it
from
me
who
need
it
so
much
he
spoke
in
pauses
but
his
voice
never
faltered
i
have
prayed
for
that
grace
ever
since
i
have
been
here
he
hath
given
me
great
peace
in
this
place
i
think
he
will
give
it
me
to
the
end
you
must
pray
my
my
child
you
must
not
cry
like
that
she
lifted
her
agonized
face
for
a
moment
then
she
let
it
fall
again
it
seemed
as
if
he
knew
the
very
thoughts
of
her
this
all
seems
very
perfect
to
me
he
went
on
it
was
yourself
who
first
turned
me
to
this
life
and
you
knew
surely
what
you
did
i
knew
at
least
all
the
while
i
think
and
i
have
never
ceased
to
thank
god
and
it
was
through
your
hands
that
the
letter
came
to
me
to
go
to
fotheringay
and
it
was
in
your
house
that
i
was
taken
and
it
was
maine
beads
that
they
found
on
me
when
they
searched
me
here
the
pair
of
beads
you
gave
me
again
she
stared
at
him
blind
and
bewildered
he
went
on
steadily
and
now
it
is
you
again
who
bring
me
the
first
news
of
my
passion
it
is
yourself
first
and
last
under
god
that
have
brought
me
all
these
graces
and
crosses
and
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
but
you
must
pray
for
me
to
the
end
and
after
it
too
chapter
viii
i
water
said
a
sharp
voice
pricking
through
the
enormous
thickness
of
the
bloodshot
dark
that
had
come
down
on
him
there
followed
a
sound
of
floods
then
a
sense
of
sudden
coolness
and
he
opened
his
eyes
once
more
and
became
aware
of
unbearable
pain
in
arms
and
feet
again
the
whirling
dark
striped
with
blood
colour
fell
on
him
like
a
blanket
again
the
sound
of
waters
falling
and
the
sense
of
coolness
and
again
he
opened
his
eyes
for
a
minute
or
two
it
was
all
that
he
could
do
to
hold
himself
in
consciousness
it
appeared
to
him
a
necessity
to
do
so
he
could
see
a
roof
of
beams
and
rafters
and
on
these
he
fixed
his
eyes
thinking
that
he
could
hold
himself
so
as
by
thin
wiry
threads
of
sight
from
falling
again
into
the
pit
where
all
was
black
or
the
pain
was
appalling
but
he
thought
he
had
gripped
it
at
last
and
could
hold
it
so
like
a
wrestler
as
the
pain
began
to
resolve
itself
into
throbs
and
stabs
from
the
continuous
strain
in
which
at
first
it
had
shown
itself
a
strain
that
was
like
a
shrill
horn
blowing
or
a
blaze
of
bluish
light
he
began
to
see
more
and
to
understand
a
little
there
were
four
or
five
faces
looking
down
on
him
one
was
the
face
of
a
man
he
had
seen
somewhere
in
an
inn
it
was
at
fotheringay
it
was
my
lord
shrewsbury
man
another
was
a
lean
face
a
black
hat
came
and
went
behind
it
the
lips
were
drawn
in
a
sort
of
smile
so
that
he
could
see
the
teeth
then
he
perceived
next
that
he
himself
was
lying
in
a
kind
of
shallow
trough
of
wood
upon
the
floor
he
could
see
his
bare
feet
raised
a
little
and
tied
with
cords
then
one
by
one
these
sights
fitted
themselves
into
one
another
and
made
sense
he
remembered
that
he
was
in
derby
gaol
not
in
his
own
cell
that
the
lean
face
was
of
a
man
called
topcliffe
that
a
physician
was
there
as
well
as
the
others
that
they
had
been
questioning
him
on
various
points
and
that
some
of
these
points
he
had
answered
while
others
he
had
not
and
must
not
some
of
them
concerned
her
grace
of
the
scots
these
he
had
answered
then
again
association
came
back
as
thy
arms
o
christ
he
whispered
now
then
came
the
sharp
voice
in
his
ear
so
close
and
harsh
as
to
distress
him
these
questions
again
were
there
any
other
places
besides
at
padley
and
booth
edge
in
the
parish
of
hathersage
where
you
said
mass
o
christ
were
extended
on
the
cross
began
the
tortured
man
dreamily
it
was
a
scream
whispered
rather
than
shrieked
that
was
torn
from
him
by
the
sharpness
of
the
agony
his
body
had
lifted
from
the
floor
without
will
of
his
own
twisting
a
little
and
what
seemed
as
strings
of
fiery
pain
had
shot
upwards
from
his
feet
and
downwards
from
his
wrists
as
the
roller
was
suddenly
jerked
again
he
hung
there
perhaps
ten
or
fifteen
seconds
conscious
only
of
the
blinding
pain
questions
questioners
roof
and
faces
all
gone
and
drowned
again
in
a
whirling
tumult
of
darkness
and
red
streaks
the
sweat
poured
again
suddenly
from
his
whole
body
then
again
he
sank
relaxed
upon
the
floor
and
the
pulses
beat
in
his
head
and
he
thought
that
marjorie
and
her
mother
and
his
own
father
were
all
looking
at
him
he
heard
presently
the
same
voice
talking
and
answer
the
questions
that
are
put
to
you
now
then
we
will
begin
the
others
if
it
please
you
better
in
what
month
was
it
that
you
first
became
privy
to
the
plot
against
her
grace
wait
whispered
the
priest
wait
and
i
will
answer
that
he
understood
that
there
was
a
trap
here
the
question
had
been
framed
differently
last
time
but
his
mind
was
all
and
he
feared
he
might
answer
wrongly
if
he
could
not
collect
himself
he
still
wondered
why
so
many
friends
of
his
were
in
the
room
even
father
campion
he
drew
a
breath
again
presently
and
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
broke
like
a
shattered
trumpet
and
he
could
not
command
it
he
must
whisper
it
was
in
august
i
think
i
think
it
was
august
two
years
august
you
mean
may
or
april
no
it
was
august
at
least
all
that
i
know
of
the
plot
was
when
when
his
thoughts
became
confused
again
it
was
like
strings
of
wool
he
thought
twisted
violently
together
a
strand
snapped
now
and
again
he
made
a
violent
effort
and
caught
an
end
as
it
was
slipping
away
it
was
in
august
i
think
the
day
that
babington
fled
that
he
wrote
to
me
and
sent
me
he
paused
he
became
aware
that
here
too
lurked
a
trap
if
he
were
to
say
he
had
seen
mary
he
would
surely
be
asked
what
he
had
seen
her
for
and
his
priesthood
might
be
so
proved
against
him
he
could
not
remember
whether
that
had
been
proved
and
so
would
father
campion
advise
him
perhaps
whether
the
voice
jarred
again
and
startled
him
into
a
flash
of
coherence
he
thought
he
saw
a
way
out
well
snapped
the
voice
sent
you
sent
you
whither
sent
me
to
chartley
where
i
saw
her
grace
her
grace
of
the
scots
and
thy
arms
o
christ
now
then
now
then
so
your
saw
her
grace
and
what
was
that
for
i
saw
her
grace
and
and
told
her
what
babington
had
told
me
what
was
that
then
that
that
he
was
her
servant
till
death
and
and
a
thousand
if
he
had
them
and
so
thy
arms
o
water
barked
the
voice
again
came
the
rush
as
of
cataracts
and
a
sensation
of
drowning
there
followed
an
instant
glow
of
life
and
then
the
intolerable
pain
came
back
and
the
heavy
darkness
ii
he
found
himself
after
some
period
lying
more
easily
he
could
not
move
hand
or
foot
his
body
only
appeared
to
live
from
his
shoulders
to
his
thighs
he
was
alive
the
rest
was
nothing
but
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
that
his
arms
were
laid
by
his
side
and
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
wooden
trough
he
wondered
at
his
hands
he
wondered
even
if
they
were
his
they
were
of
an
unusual
colour
and
bigness
and
there
was
something
like
a
bracelet
round
each
wrist
then
he
perceived
that
he
was
shirtless
and
hoseless
and
that
the
bracelets
were
not
bracelets
but
rings
of
swollen
flesh
but
there
was
no
longer
any
pain
or
even
sensation
in
them
and
he
was
aware
that
his
mouth
glowed
as
if
he
had
drunk
ardent
spirits
he
was
considering
all
this
slowly
like
a
child
contemplating
a
new
toy
then
there
came
something
between
him
and
the
light
he
saw
a
couple
of
faces
eyeing
him
then
the
voice
began
again
at
first
confused
and
buzzing
then
articulate
and
he
remembered
now
then
said
the
voice
you
have
had
but
a
taste
of
it
a
taste
of
it
a
taste
of
it
the
phrase
repeated
itself
like
the
catch
of
a
song
when
he
regained
his
attention
the
sentence
had
moved
on
these
questions
i
will
put
them
to
you
again
from
the
beginning
you
will
give
your
answer
to
each
and
if
my
lord
is
not
satisfied
we
must
try
again
my
lord
thought
the
priest
he
rolled
his
eyes
round
a
little
further
he
dared
not
move
his
head
the
sinews
of
his
throat
burned
like
steel
cords
at
the
thought
of
it
and
he
saw
a
little
table
floating
somewhere
in
the
dark
a
candle
burned
on
it
and
a
melancholy
face
with
dreamy
eyes
was
brightly
illuminated
that
was
my
lord
shrewsbury
he
considered
in
what
month
that
you
first
became
privy
to
the
plot
against
her
grace
sense
was
coming
back
to
him
again
now
he
remembered
what
he
had
said
just
now
it
was
in
august
he
whispered
in
august
i
think
two
years
ago
babington
wrote
to
me
of
it
and
you
went
to
the
queen
of
the
scots
you
say
yes
and
what
did
you
there
i
gave
the
message
what
was
that
that
babington
was
her
servant
always
that
he
regretted
nothing
save
that
he
had
failed
he
begged
her
to
pray
for
his
soul
and
for
all
that
had
been
with
him
in
the
enterprise
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
was
astonishingly
voluble
all
at
once
he
reflected
that
he
must
be
careful
and
what
did
she
say
to
that
she
declared
herself
guiltless
of
the
plot
that
she
knew
nothing
of
it
and
that
now
then
now
then
you
expect
my
lord
to
believe
that
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
what
was
said
and
you
profess
that
you
knew
nothing
of
the
plot
till
then
i
knew
nothing
of
it
till
then
whispered
the
priest
steadily
but
a
face
suddenly
blotted
out
more
of
the
light
yes
anthony
i
mean
babington
had
spoken
to
me
a
great
while
before
in
in
some
village
inn
i
forget
where
it
was
when
i
was
a
lad
he
asked
whether
i
would
join
in
some
enterprise
he
did
not
say
what
it
was
but
i
thought
it
to
be
against
the
queen
of
england
and
i
would
he
closed
his
eyes
again
there
had
begun
a
slow
heat
of
pain
in
ankles
and
wrists
not
wholly
unbearable
and
a
warmth
began
to
spread
in
his
body
a
great
shudder
or
two
shook
him
the
voice
said
something
he
could
not
hear
then
a
metal
rim
was
pressed
to
his
mouth
and
a
stream
of
something
at
once
icy
and
fiery
ran
into
his
mouth
and
out
at
the
corners
he
swallowed
once
or
twice
and
his
senses
came
back
you
do
not
expect
us
to
believe
all
that
came
the
voice
it
is
the
truth
for
all
that
murmured
the
priest
the
next
question
came
sudden
as
a
shot
fired
you
were
at
fotheringay
yes
in
what
house
i
was
in
the
inn
the
inn
i
think
it
is
and
you
spoke
with
her
grace
again
no
i
could
not
get
at
her
but
well
i
was
in
the
court
of
the
castle
when
her
grace
was
executed
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
he
thought
that
someone
had
moved
over
to
the
table
where
my
lord
sat
but
he
could
not
move
his
eyes
again
the
labour
was
too
great
who
was
with
you
in
the
inn
as
your
friend
i
mean
a
a
young
man
was
with
me
his
name
was
merton
he
is
in
france
i
think
and
he
knew
you
to
be
a
priest
came
the
voice
without
an
hesitation
why
then
he
stopped
short
just
in
time
well
how
should
he
think
that
asked
robin
there
was
a
laugh
somewhere
then
the
voice
went
on
almost
alban
what
is
the
use
of
this
fencing
you
were
taken
in
a
with
the
very
vestments
at
your
feet
we
you
to
be
a
priest
we
are
not
seeking
to
entrap
you
in
that
for
there
is
no
need
but
there
are
other
matters
altogether
which
we
must
have
from
you
you
have
been
made
priest
beyond
the
seas
in
rheims
i
swear
to
you
that
i
was
not
whispered
robin
instantly
and
eagerly
thinking
he
saw
a
loophole
well
then
at
châlons
or
douay
it
matters
not
where
that
is
not
our
affair
all
that
will
be
dealt
with
before
my
lords
at
the
assizes
but
what
we
must
have
from
you
now
is
your
answer
to
some
other
questions
assuming
me
to
be
a
priest
alban
i
will
talk
no
more
on
that
point
i
tell
you
we
know
it
but
we
must
have
answers
on
other
points
i
will
come
back
to
merton
presently
these
are
the
questions
i
will
read
them
through
to
you
then
we
will
deal
with
them
one
by
one
there
was
the
rustle
of
a
paper
an
extraordinary
desire
for
sleep
came
down
on
the
priest
it
was
only
by
twitching
his
head
a
little
and
causing
himself
acute
shoots
of
pain
in
his
neck
that
he
could
keep
himself
awake
he
knew
that
he
must
not
let
his
attention
wander
again
he
remembered
clearly
how
that
father
campion
was
dead
and
that
marjorie
could
not
have
been
here
just
now
he
must
take
great
care
not
to
become
so
much
confused
again
the
first
question
read
the
voice
slowly
is
whether
you
have
said
mass
in
other
places
beside
padley
and
the
manor
at
booth
edge
we
know
that
you
must
have
done
so
but
we
must
have
the
names
of
the
places
and
of
the
parties
present
so
far
as
you
can
remember
them
the
second
question
is
the
names
of
all
those
other
priests
with
whom
you
have
spoken
in
england
since
you
came
from
rheims
and
the
names
of
all
other
students
not
yet
priests
or
scarcely
whom
you
knew
at
rheims
and
who
are
for
england
the
third
question
is
the
names
of
all
those
whom
you
know
to
be
friends
of
john
fitzherbert
bassett
and
fenton
not
being
priests
but
papists
these
three
questions
will
do
as
a
beginning
when
you
have
answered
these
there
is
a
number
more
now
sir
the
last
two
words
were
rapped
out
sharply
robin
opened
his
eyes
as
to
the
first
two
questions
he
whispered
these
assume
that
i
am
a
priest
myself
yet
that
is
what
you
have
to
prove
against
me
the
third
question
concerns
concerns
my
loyalty
to
my
friends
but
i
will
tell
you
yes
the
voice
was
sharp
and
eager
i
will
tell
you
the
names
of
two
friends
of
each
of
those
gentlemen
you
have
named
a
pen
suddenly
scratched
on
paper
he
could
not
see
who
held
it
yes
said
the
voice
again
well
sir
the
names
of
two
of
the
friends
of
fitzherbert
are
bassett
and
fenton
the
names
bah
the
word
sounded
like
the
explosion
of
a
gun
you
are
playing
with
us
the
names
murmured
the
priest
slowly
of
two
of
fenton
friends
are
fitzherbert
and
a
face
thrust
itself
suddenly
almost
into
his
he
could
feel
the
hot
breath
on
his
forehead
see
here
alban
you
are
fooling
us
do
you
think
this
is
a
christmas
game
i
tell
you
it
is
not
yet
three
there
are
three
hours
more
yet
a
smooth
sad
voice
interrupted
the
reversed
face
vanished
you
have
threatened
the
prisoner
it
said
but
you
have
not
yet
told
him
the
alternative
no
my
lord
yes
my
lord
listen
alban
my
lord
here
says
that
if
you
will
answer
these
questions
he
will
use
his
influence
on
your
behalf
your
life
is
forfeited
as
you
know
very
well
there
is
not
a
dog
chance
for
you
yet
if
you
will
but
answer
these
three
questions
and
no
more
no
more
my
lord
yes
these
three
questions
and
no
more
my
lord
will
use
his
influence
for
you
he
can
promise
nothing
he
says
but
that
but
my
lord
influence
well
we
need
say
no
more
on
that
point
if
you
refuse
to
answer
on
the
other
hand
there
are
yet
three
hours
more
there
is
all
and
the
next
day
and
after
that
your
case
will
be
before
my
lords
at
the
assizes
you
have
had
but
a
taste
of
what
we
can
do
and
then
sir
my
lord
does
not
wish
to
be
harsh
there
was
a
pause
robin
was
counting
up
the
hours
it
was
three
now
then
he
had
been
on
the
rack
with
intervals
since
nine
that
was
six
hours
there
was
but
half
that
again
for
then
would
come
the
night
he
need
not
consider
further
than
that
but
he
must
guard
his
tongue
it
might
speak
in
spite
well
mr
alban
he
opened
his
eyes
well
sir
which
is
it
to
be
the
priest
smiled
and
closed
his
eyes
again
if
he
could
but
fix
his
attention
on
the
mere
pain
he
thought
and
refuse
utterly
to
consider
the
way
of
escape
he
might
be
able
to
keep
his
unruly
tongue
in
check
you
will
not
then
no
the
appalling
pain
ran
through
him
again
like
fiery
snakes
of
iron
from
wrist
to
shoulders
from
ankles
to
thighs
as
the
hands
seized
him
and
lifted
him
there
was
a
moment
or
two
of
relief
as
he
sank
down
once
more
into
the
trough
of
torture
he
could
feel
that
his
feet
were
being
handled
but
it
appeared
as
if
nothing
touched
his
flesh
he
gave
a
great
sighing
moan
as
his
arms
were
drawn
back
over
his
head
and
the
sweat
poured
again
from
all
over
his
body
then
as
the
cords
tightened
as
thy
arms
o
christ
were
extended
he
whispered
chapter
ix
i
a
great
murmuring
crowd
filled
every
flat
spot
of
ground
and
pavement
and
parapet
they
stood
even
on
the
balustrade
of
mary
bridge
there
were
fringes
of
them
against
the
sky
on
the
edges
of
roofs
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
no
flat
surface
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
except
on
the
broad
reach
of
the
river
and
near
the
head
of
the
bridge
in
the
circular
space
ringed
by
steel
caps
and
where
the
gallows
and
ladder
rose
close
beside
them
a
column
of
black
smoke
rose
heavily
into
the
morning
air
bellying
away
into
the
clear
air
a
continual
steady
low
murmur
of
talking
went
up
continually
there
had
been
no
hanging
within
the
memory
of
any
that
had
roused
such
interest
derbyshire
men
had
been
hung
often
enough
a
criminal
usually
had
a
dozen
friends
at
least
in
the
crowd
to
whom
he
shouted
from
the
ladder
seminary
priests
had
been
executed
often
enough
now
to
have
destroyed
the
novelty
of
it
for
the
mob
why
three
had
been
done
to
death
here
little
more
than
two
months
ago
in
this
very
place
they
gave
no
sport
certainly
they
died
too
quietly
and
what
peculiar
interest
there
was
in
it
lay
in
the
contemplation
of
the
fact
that
it
was
for
religion
that
they
died
gentlemen
too
had
been
hanged
here
now
and
then
polished
persons
dressed
in
their
best
who
took
off
their
outer
clothes
carefully
and
in
one
or
two
cases
had
handed
them
to
a
servant
gentlemen
with
whom
the
sheriff
shook
hands
before
the
end
who
eyed
the
mob
imperturbably
or
affected
even
not
to
be
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
vulgar
but
this
hanging
was
sublime
first
he
was
a
derbyshire
man
a
seminary
priest
and
a
gentleman
three
points
yet
this
was
no
more
than
the
groundwork
of
his
surpassing
interest
for
next
he
had
been
racked
beyond
belief
it
was
for
three
days
before
his
sentence
that
topcliffe
himself
had
dealt
with
him
yes
topcliffe
was
the
tall
man
that
had
his
rooms
in
the
and
always
went
abroad
with
two
servants
he
was
to
have
padley
too
it
was
said
as
a
reward
for
all
his
zeal
of
course
young
audrey
for
that
was
his
real
name
not
alban
that
was
a
popish
such
as
they
all
used
audrey
had
not
been
on
the
rack
for
the
whole
of
every
day
but
he
had
been
in
the
eight
or
nine
hours
on
the
first
day
four
the
second
and
six
or
seven
the
third
and
he
had
not
answered
one
single
question
differently
from
the
manner
in
which
he
had
answered
it
before
ever
he
had
been
on
the
rack
at
all
there
was
a
dim
sense
of
pride
with
regard
to
this
in
many
derbyshire
minds
a
derbyshire
man
it
appeared
was
more
than
a
match
for
even
a
londoner
and
a
sworn
servant
of
her
grace
it
was
said
that
audrey
would
have
to
be
helped
up
the
ladder
even
though
he
had
not
been
racked
for
a
whole
week
since
his
sentence
next
the
trial
itself
had
been
full
of
interest
a
papist
priest
was
of
course
fair
game
why
the
spanish
armada
itself
had
been
full
of
them
it
was
said
all
come
to
subdue
england
well
they
had
had
their
bellyful
of
salt
water
and
english
iron
by
now
but
this
papisher
had
hit
back
and
given
sport
he
had
flatly
refused
to
be
caught
though
the
questions
were
swift
and
subtle
enough
to
catch
any
clerk
certainly
he
had
not
denied
that
he
was
a
priest
but
he
had
said
that
that
was
what
the
crown
must
prove
he
was
not
there
as
a
witness
he
had
said
but
as
a
prisoner
he
had
even
entreated
them
to
respect
their
own
legal
dignities
but
there
had
been
a
number
of
things
against
him
and
even
if
none
of
these
had
been
proved
still
the
mere
sum
of
them
was
enough
there
could
be
no
smoke
without
fire
said
the
it
was
alleged
that
he
had
been
privy
to
the
plot
against
the
queen
the
plot
of
young
babington
who
had
sold
his
house
down
there
a
week
or
two
only
before
his
arrest
he
had
denied
this
but
he
had
allowed
that
he
had
spoken
with
her
grace
immediately
after
the
plot
and
this
was
a
highly
suspicious
circumstance
if
he
allowed
so
much
as
this
the
rest
might
be
safely
presumed
again
it
was
said
that
he
had
had
part
in
attempts
to
free
the
queen
of
the
scots
even
from
fotheringay
itself
and
had
been
in
the
castle
court
with
a
number
of
armed
servants
at
the
very
time
of
her
execution
again
if
he
allowed
that
he
had
been
present
even
though
he
denied
the
armed
servants
the
rest
might
be
presumed
finally
since
he
were
a
priest
and
had
seen
her
grace
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
chaplain
allowed
to
her
it
was
certain
that
he
must
have
ministered
their
popish
superstitions
to
her
and
this
was
neither
denied
nor
affirmed
he
had
said
to
this
that
they
had
yet
to
prove
him
a
priest
at
all
the
very
spectacle
of
the
trial
too
had
been
remarkable
for
first
there
was
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
the
prisoner
bent
double
like
an
old
man
with
the
face
of
a
dead
one
though
he
could
not
be
above
thirty
years
old
at
the
very
most
and
then
there
was
the
unusual
number
of
magistrates
present
in
court
besides
the
judges
and
my
lord
shrewsbury
himself
who
had
presided
at
the
racking
it
was
one
of
my
lord
men
too
that
had
helped
to
identify
the
prisoner
but
the
supreme
interest
lay
in
even
more
startling
circumstances
in
the
history
of
mistress
manners
who
was
present
through
the
trial
with
biddell
the
lawyer
and
who
had
obtained
at
least
two
interviews
with
the
prisoner
one
before
the
torture
and
the
other
after
sentence
it
was
in
mistress
manners
house
at
booth
edge
that
the
priest
had
been
taken
and
it
was
freely
rumoured
that
although
audrey
had
once
been
betrothed
to
her
yet
that
she
had
released
and
sent
him
herself
to
rheims
and
all
to
end
like
this
and
yet
she
could
bear
to
come
and
see
him
again
and
it
was
said
would
be
present
somewhere
in
the
crowd
even
at
his
death
finally
the
tale
of
how
the
priest
had
been
taken
by
his
own
father
old
audrey
of
matstead
him
that
was
now
lying
sick
in
columbell
house
this
put
the
crown
on
all
the
rest
a
hundred
rumours
flew
this
way
and
that
one
said
that
the
old
man
had
known
nothing
of
his
son
presence
in
the
country
but
had
thought
him
to
be
still
in
foreign
parts
another
that
he
knew
him
to
be
in
england
but
not
that
he
was
in
the
county
a
third
that
he
knew
very
well
who
it
was
in
the
house
he
went
to
search
and
had
searched
it
and
taken
him
on
purpose
to
set
his
own
loyalty
beyond
question
opinions
differed
as
to
the
propriety
of
such
an
action
so
then
the
great
crowd
of
heads
men
from
all
the
countryside
from
farms
and
cottages
and
the
wild
hills
mingling
with
the
townsfolk
this
crowd
broken
up
into
levels
and
patches
by
river
and
houses
and
lanes
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
october
sunshine
and
sent
up
with
the
column
of
smoke
that
eddied
out
from
beneath
the
bubbling
by
the
gallows
a
continual
murmur
of
talking
like
the
sound
of
wheels
of
great
carts
he
felt
dazed
and
blind
yet
with
a
kind
of
lightness
too
as
he
came
out
of
the
into
that
packed
mass
of
faces
held
back
by
guards
from
the
open
space
where
the
horse
and
the
hurdle
waited
a
dozen
persons
or
so
were
within
the
guards
he
knew
several
of
them
by
sight
two
or
three
were
magistrates
another
was
an
officer
two
were
ministers
with
their
bibles
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
he
were
afraid
fear
was
there
indeed
he
knew
well
enough
that
in
his
case
at
any
rate
the
execution
would
be
done
as
the
law
ordered
that
he
would
be
cut
down
before
he
had
time
to
die
and
that
the
butchery
would
be
done
on
him
while
he
would
still
be
conscious
of
it
death
too
was
fearful
in
any
case
yet
there
were
so
many
other
things
to
occupy
him
there
was
the
exhilarating
knowledge
that
he
was
to
die
for
his
faith
and
nothing
else
for
they
had
offered
him
his
life
if
he
would
go
to
church
and
they
had
proved
nothing
as
to
any
complicity
of
his
in
any
plot
and
how
could
they
since
there
was
none
there
was
the
pain
of
his
tormented
body
to
occupy
him
a
pain
that
had
passed
from
the
acute
localized
agonies
of
snapped
sinews
and
wrenched
joints
into
one
vast
physical
misery
that
soaked
his
whole
body
as
in
a
flood
a
pain
that
never
ceased
of
which
he
dreamed
darkly
as
a
hungry
man
dreams
of
food
which
he
can
not
eat
to
which
he
awoke
again
twenty
times
a
night
as
to
a
companion
nearer
to
him
than
the
thoughts
with
which
he
attempted
to
distract
himself
this
pain
at
least
would
have
an
end
presently
again
there
was
an
intermittent
curiosity
as
to
how
and
what
would
befall
his
flying
soul
when
the
butchery
was
done
to
sup
in
heaven
was
a
phrase
used
by
one
of
his
predecessors
on
the
threshold
of
death
for
what
did
that
stand
and
at
other
times
there
had
been
no
curiosity
but
an
acquiescence
in
old
childish
images
heaven
at
such
times
appeared
to
him
as
a
summer
garden
with
pavilions
and
running
water
and
the
song
of
birds
a
garden
where
he
would
lie
at
ease
at
last
from
his
torn
body
and
that
feverish
mind
which
was
all
that
his
pain
had
left
to
him
where
mary
went
gracious
and
motherly
with
her
virgins
about
her
where
the
crucified
lamb
of
god
would
talk
with
him
as
a
man
talks
with
his
friend
and
allow
him
to
lie
at
the
pierced
feet
where
the
glory
of
god
rested
like
eternal
sunlight
on
all
that
was
there
on
the
river
of
life
and
the
wood
of
the
trees
that
are
for
the
healing
of
all
hurts
and
last
of
all
there
was
a
confused
medley
of
more
human
thoughts
that
concerned
persons
other
than
himself
he
could
not
remember
all
the
persons
clearly
their
names
and
their
faces
came
and
went
marjorie
his
father
john
fitzherbert
and
anthony
who
had
been
allowed
to
come
and
see
him
dick
sampson
who
had
come
in
with
marjorie
the
second
time
and
had
kissed
his
hands
one
thing
at
least
he
remembered
clearly
as
he
stood
here
and
that
was
how
he
had
bidden
mistress
manners
even
now
not
to
go
overseas
and
become
a
nun
as
she
had
wished
but
rather
to
continue
her
work
in
derbyshire
if
she
could
so
then
he
stood
bent
double
on
two
sticks
blinking
and
peering
out
at
the
faces
wondering
whether
it
was
a
roar
of
anger
or
welcome
or
compassion
that
had
broken
out
at
his
apparition
and
smiling
smiling
piteously
not
of
deliberation
but
because
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
so
moved
and
he
could
not
contract
them
again
he
understood
presently
that
he
was
to
lie
down
on
the
hurdle
with
his
head
to
the
horses
heels
this
was
a
great
business
to
be
undertaken
with
care
he
gave
his
two
sticks
to
a
man
and
took
his
arm
then
he
kneeled
clinging
to
the
arm
as
a
child
to
a
swimmer
in
a
rough
sea
and
sank
gently
down
but
he
could
not
straighten
his
legs
so
they
allowed
him
to
lie
half
and
tied
him
so
it
was
amazingly
uncomfortable
and
before
he
was
settled
twice
the
sweat
suddenly
poured
from
his
face
as
he
found
some
new
channel
of
pain
in
his
body
an
order
or
two
was
issued
in
a
loud
shouting
voice
there
was
a
great
confusion
and
scuffling
and
the
crack
of
a
whip
then
with
a
jerk
that
tore
his
whole
being
he
was
flicked
from
his
place
the
pain
swelled
and
swelled
till
there
seemed
no
more
room
for
it
in
all
god
world
and
he
closed
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
and
the
faces
and
the
sky
whirl
about
in
that
mad
jigging
dance
after
that
he
knew
very
little
of
the
journey
for
the
most
part
his
eyes
were
tight
closed
he
sobbed
aloud
half
a
dozen
times
as
the
hurdle
lifted
and
dropped
over
rough
places
in
the
road
two
or
three
times
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
what
the
sounds
signified
especially
a
loud
bellowing
voice
almost
in
his
ear
that
cried
texts
of
scripture
at
him
have
but
one
mediator
between
god
and
man
the
man
christ
then
being
justified
by
faith
for
if
by
the
works
of
the
law
we
are
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
at
that
and
there
was
the
face
of
one
of
the
ministers
bobbing
against
the
sky
flushed
and
breathless
yet
indomitable
bawling
aloud
as
he
trotted
along
to
keep
pace
with
the
horse
then
he
closed
his
eyes
again
he
knew
that
he
too
could
bandy
texts
if
that
were
what
was
required
perhaps
if
he
were
a
better
man
and
more
mortified
he
might
be
able
to
do
so
as
the
martyrs
sometimes
had
done
but
he
could
not
he
would
have
a
word
to
say
presently
perhaps
if
it
were
permitted
but
not
now
his
pain
occupied
him
he
had
to
deal
with
that
and
keep
back
if
he
could
those
sobs
that
were
wrenched
from
him
now
and
again
he
had
made
but
a
poor
beginning
in
his
journey
he
thought
he
must
die
more
decently
than
that
the
end
came
unexpectedly
just
when
he
thought
he
had
gained
his
again
so
as
to
make
no
sound
at
any
rate
the
hurdle
stopped
he
clenched
his
teeth
to
meet
the
dreadful
wrench
with
which
it
would
move
again
but
it
did
not
instead
there
was
a
man
down
by
him
untying
his
bonds
he
lay
quite
still
when
they
were
undone
he
did
not
know
which
limb
to
move
first
and
he
dreaded
to
move
any
now
then
said
the
voice
with
a
touch
of
compassion
he
thought
he
set
his
teeth
gripped
the
arm
and
raised
himself
first
to
his
knees
then
to
his
feet
where
he
stood
swaying
an
indescribable
roar
ascended
steadily
on
all
sides
but
he
could
see
little
of
the
crowd
as
yet
he
was
standing
in
a
cleared
space
held
by
guards
a
couple
of
dozen
persons
stood
here
three
or
four
on
horseback
and
one
of
these
he
thought
to
be
my
lord
shrewsbury
but
he
was
not
sure
since
his
head
was
against
the
glare
of
the
sun
he
turned
a
little
still
holding
to
the
man
arm
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
saw
a
ladder
behind
him
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
that
its
head
rested
against
the
of
a
single
gallows
that
a
rope
hung
from
this
beam
and
that
a
figure
sitting
astride
of
this
was
busy
with
this
rope
the
shock
of
the
sight
cooled
and
nerved
him
rather
it
drew
his
attention
all
from
himself
he
looked
lower
again
and
behind
the
gallows
was
a
column
of
heavy
smoke
going
up
and
in
the
midst
of
the
smoke
a
cauldron
hung
on
a
tripod
beside
the
cauldron
was
a
great
stump
of
wood
with
a
chopper
and
a
knife
lying
upon
it
he
drew
one
long
steady
breath
expelled
it
again
and
turned
back
to
my
lord
shrewsbury
as
he
turned
he
saw
him
make
a
sign
and
felt
himself
grasped
from
behind
iii
he
reached
at
last
with
his
hands
the
rung
of
the
ladder
on
which
the
executioner
foot
rested
hearing
as
he
went
painfully
up
the
roar
of
voices
wax
to
an
incredible
volume
it
was
impossible
for
any
to
speak
so
that
he
could
hear
but
he
saw
the
hands
above
him
in
eloquent
gesture
and
understood
that
he
was
to
turn
round
he
did
so
cautiously
grasping
the
man
foot
and
so
rested
half
sitting
on
a
rung
and
holding
it
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
two
hands
then
he
felt
a
rope
pass
round
his
wrists
drawing
them
closer
together
as
he
turned
the
roar
of
voices
died
to
a
murmur
the
murmur
died
to
silence
and
he
understood
and
remembered
it
was
now
the
time
to
speak
he
gathered
for
the
last
time
all
his
forces
together
with
the
sudden
silence
clearness
came
back
to
his
mind
and
he
remembered
word
for
word
the
little
speech
he
had
rehearsed
so
often
during
the
last
week
he
had
learned
it
by
heart
fearful
lest
god
should
give
him
no
words
if
he
trusted
to
the
moment
lest
god
should
not
see
fit
to
give
him
even
that
interior
consolation
which
was
denied
to
so
many
of
the
saints
yet
without
which
he
could
not
speak
from
the
heart
he
had
been
right
he
knew
now
there
was
no
religious
consolation
he
felt
none
of
that
strange
ecstasy
that
had
transfigured
other
deaths
like
his
he
had
none
of
the
ready
wit
that
campion
had
showed
he
saw
nothing
but
the
clear
october
sky
above
him
cut
by
the
roofs
fringed
with
heads
a
skein
of
birds
passed
slowly
over
it
as
he
raised
his
eyes
and
beneath
that
irreckonable
pavement
of
heads
motionless
now
as
a
cornfield
in
a
still
evening
one
glimpse
of
the
river
the
river
he
remembered
even
at
this
instant
that
came
down
from
hathersage
and
padley
and
his
old
home
but
there
was
no
open
vision
such
as
he
had
half
hoped
to
see
no
unimaginable
glories
looming
slowly
through
the
veils
in
which
god
hides
himself
on
earth
no
radiant
face
smiling
into
his
own
only
this
arena
of
watching
human
faces
turned
up
to
his
waiting
for
his
last
sermon
he
thought
he
saw
faces
that
he
knew
though
he
lost
them
again
as
his
eyes
swept
on
barton
the
old
minister
of
matstead
dick
bassett
their
faces
looked
terrified
however
this
was
not
his
affair
now
as
he
was
about
to
speak
he
felt
hands
about
his
neck
and
then
the
touch
of
a
rope
passed
across
his
face
for
an
indescribable
instant
a
terror
seized
on
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
set
his
teeth
the
spasm
passed
and
so
soon
as
the
hands
were
withdrawn
again
he
began
good
people
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
high
and
broken
the
silence
became
absolute
a
thin
crowing
of
a
cock
from
far
off
in
the
country
came
like
a
thread
and
ceased
good
people
i
die
here
as
a
catholic
man
for
my
priesthood
which
i
now
confess
before
all
the
world
a
stir
of
heads
and
movements
below
distracted
him
but
he
went
on
at
once
there
have
been
alleged
against
me
crimes
in
which
i
had
neither
act
nor
part
against
the
life
of
her
grace
and
the
peace
of
her
dominions
pray
for
her
grace
rang
out
a
sharp
voice
below
him
i
will
do
so
presently
it
is
for
that
that
i
am
said
to
die
in
that
i
took
part
in
plots
of
which
i
knew
nothing
till
all
was
done
yet
i
was
offered
my
life
if
i
would
but
conform
and
go
to
church
so
you
see
very
well
a
storm
of
confused
voices
interrupted
him
he
could
distinguish
no
sentence
so
he
waited
till
they
ceased
again
so
you
see
very
well
he
cried
for
what
it
is
that
i
die
it
is
for
the
catholic
faith
beat
the
drums
beat
the
drums
cried
a
voice
there
began
a
drumming
but
a
howl
like
a
beast
surged
up
from
the
whole
crowd
when
it
died
again
the
drum
was
silent
he
glanced
down
at
my
lord
shrewsbury
and
saw
him
whispering
with
an
officer
then
he
continued
it
is
for
the
catholic
faith
then
that
i
die
that
which
was
once
the
faith
of
all
england
and
which
i
pray
may
be
one
day
its
faith
again
in
that
have
i
lived
and
in
that
will
i
die
and
i
pray
god
further
that
all
who
hear
me
may
have
grace
to
take
it
as
i
do
as
the
true
christian
religion
and
none
other
revealed
by
our
saviour
christ
the
crowd
was
wholly
quiet
again
now
my
lord
had
finished
his
whispering
and
was
looking
up
but
the
priest
had
made
his
little
sermon
and
thought
that
he
had
best
pray
aloud
before
his
strength
failed
him
his
knees
were
already
shaking
violently
under
him
and
the
sweat
was
pouring
again
from
his
face
not
so
much
from
the
effort
of
his
speech
as
from
the
pain
which
that
effort
caused
him
it
seemed
that
there
was
not
one
nerve
in
his
body
that
was
not
in
pain
i
ask
all
catholics
then
that
hear
me
to
join
with
me
in
prayer
first
for
christ
catholic
church
throughout
the
world
for
her
peace
and
furtherance
next
for
our
england
for
the
conversion
of
all
her
children
and
above
all
for
her
grace
my
queen
and
yours
that
god
will
bless
and
save
her
in
this
world
and
her
soul
eternally
in
the
next
for
these
and
all
other
such
matters
i
will
beg
all
catholics
to
join
with
me
and
to
say
the
and
when
i
am
in
my
agony
to
say
yet
another
for
my
soul
from
the
whole
packed
space
the
prayer
rose
up
in
great
and
heavy
waves
of
sound
there
were
cries
of
mockery
three
or
four
times
but
each
was
suddenly
cut
off
the
waves
of
sound
rolled
round
and
ceased
and
the
silence
was
profound
the
priest
opened
his
eyes
closed
them
again
then
with
a
loud
voice
he
began
to
cry
o
christ
as
thine
arms
were
extended
he
stopped
again
shaken
even
from
that
intense
point
of
concentration
to
which
he
was
forcing
himself
by
the
amazing
sound
that
met
his
ears
he
had
heard
at
the
close
of
the
a
noise
which
he
could
not
interpret
but
no
more
had
happened
but
now
the
whole
world
seemed
screaming
and
swaying
he
heard
the
trample
of
horses
beneath
him
voices
in
loud
expostulation
he
opened
his
eyes
the
clamour
died
again
at
the
same
instant
for
a
moment
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
heads
and
up
to
the
sky
to
see
if
some
vision
then
he
looked
down
against
the
ladder
on
which
he
stood
a
man
figure
was
writhing
and
embracing
the
rungs
kneeling
on
the
ground
he
was
strangely
dressed
in
some
sort
of
a
loose
gown
in
a
tight
silk
and
his
feet
were
bare
the
man
head
was
dropped
and
the
priest
could
not
see
his
face
he
looked
beyond
for
some
explanation
and
there
stood
all
alone
a
girl
in
a
hooded
cloak
who
raised
her
great
eyes
to
his
as
he
looked
down
again
the
man
head
had
fallen
back
and
the
face
was
staring
up
at
him
so
distorted
with
speechless
entreaty
that
even
he
at
first
did
not
recognize
it
then
he
saw
it
to
be
his
father
and
understood
enough
at
least
to
act
as
a
priest
for
the
last
time
he
smiled
a
little
leaned
his
own
head
forward
as
from
a
cross
and
spoke
te
a
peccatis
tuis
in
nomine
patris
et
filii
et
spiritus
vi
he
only
awoke
once
again
after
the
strangling
and
the
darkness
had
passed
he
could
see
nothing
nor
hear
except
a
heavy
murmuring
noise
not
unpleasant
but
there
was
one
last
pain
not
into
which
all
others
had
passed
keen
and
cold
like
water
and
it
was
about
his
heart
o
christ
he
whispered
and
so
died
the
end
