i
my
revelations
as
a
spy
in
many
people
the
very
name
spy
excites
a
shudder
of
apprehension
we
spies
in
fact
get
quite
used
to
being
shuddered
at
none
of
us
spies
mind
it
at
all
whenever
i
enter
a
hotel
and
register
myself
as
a
spy
i
am
quite
accustomed
to
see
a
thrill
of
fear
run
round
the
clerks
or
clerk
behind
the
desk
us
spies
or
we
spies
for
we
call
ourselves
both
are
thus
a
race
apart
none
know
us
all
fear
us
where
do
we
live
nowhere
where
are
we
everywhere
frequently
we
don
t
know
ourselves
where
we
are
the
secret
orders
that
we
receive
come
from
so
high
up
that
it
is
often
forbidden
to
us
even
to
ask
where
we
are
a
friend
of
mine
or
at
least
a
fellow
spy
us
spies
have
no
friends
one
of
the
most
brilliant
men
in
the
hungarian
secret
service
once
spent
a
month
in
new
york
under
the
impression
that
he
was
in
winnipeg
if
this
happened
to
the
most
brilliant
think
of
the
others
all
i
say
fear
us
because
they
know
and
have
reason
to
know
our
power
hence
in
spite
of
the
prejudice
against
us
we
are
able
to
move
everywhere
to
lodge
in
the
best
hotels
and
enter
any
society
that
we
wish
to
penetrate
let
me
relate
an
incident
to
illustrate
this
a
month
ago
i
entered
one
of
the
largest
of
the
new
york
hotels
which
i
will
merely
call
the
hotel
without
naming
it
to
do
so
might
blast
it
we
spies
in
fact
never
a
hotel
at
the
most
we
indicate
it
by
a
number
known
only
to
ourselves
such
as
or
on
my
presenting
myself
at
the
desk
the
clerk
informed
me
that
he
had
no
room
vacant
i
knew
this
of
course
to
be
a
mere
subterfuge
whether
or
not
he
suspected
that
i
was
a
spy
i
can
not
say
i
was
muffled
up
to
avoid
recognition
in
a
long
overcoat
with
the
collar
turned
up
and
reaching
well
above
my
ears
while
the
black
beard
and
the
moustache
that
i
had
slipped
on
in
entering
the
hotel
concealed
my
face
let
me
speak
a
moment
to
the
manager
i
said
when
he
came
i
beckoned
him
aside
and
taking
his
ear
in
my
hand
i
breathed
two
words
into
it
good
heavens
he
gasped
while
his
face
turned
as
pale
as
ashes
is
it
enough
i
asked
can
i
have
a
room
or
must
i
breathe
again
no
no
said
the
manager
still
trembling
then
turning
to
the
clerk
give
this
gentleman
a
room
he
said
and
give
him
a
what
these
two
words
are
that
will
get
a
room
in
new
york
at
once
i
must
not
divulge
even
now
when
the
veil
of
secrecy
is
being
lifted
the
international
interests
involved
are
too
complicated
to
permit
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
if
these
two
had
failed
i
know
a
couple
of
others
still
better
i
narrate
this
incident
otherwise
trivial
as
indicating
the
astounding
ramifications
and
the
ubiquity
of
the
international
spy
system
a
similar
illustration
occurs
to
me
as
i
write
i
was
walking
the
other
day
with
another
man
on
upper
way
between
the
building
and
the
garden
do
you
see
that
man
over
there
i
said
pointing
from
the
side
of
the
street
on
which
we
were
walking
on
the
sidewalk
to
the
other
side
opposite
to
the
side
that
we
were
on
the
man
with
the
straw
hat
he
asked
yes
what
of
him
oh
nothing
i
answered
except
that
he
s
a
spy
great
heavens
exclaimed
my
acquaintance
leaning
up
against
a
for
support
a
spy
how
do
you
know
that
what
does
it
mean
i
gave
a
quiet
laugh
we
spies
learn
to
laugh
very
quietly
ha
i
said
that
is
my
secret
my
friend
sapientius
che
sara
sara
yodel
doodle
doo
my
acquaintance
fell
in
a
dead
faint
upon
the
street
i
watched
them
take
him
away
in
an
ambulance
will
the
reader
be
surprised
to
learn
that
among
the
attendants
who
removed
him
i
recognized
no
less
a
person
than
the
famous
russian
spy
poulispantzoff
what
he
was
doing
there
i
could
not
tell
no
doubt
his
orders
came
from
so
high
up
that
he
himself
did
not
know
i
had
seen
him
only
twice
before
once
when
we
were
both
disguised
as
zulus
at
buluwayo
and
once
in
the
interior
of
china
at
the
time
when
poulispantzoff
made
his
secret
entry
into
thibet
concealed
in
a
he
was
inside
the
when
i
saw
him
so
at
least
i
was
informed
by
the
coolies
who
carried
it
yet
i
recognized
him
instantly
neither
he
nor
i
however
gave
any
sign
of
recognition
other
than
an
imperceptible
movement
of
the
outer
eyelid
we
spies
learn
to
move
the
outer
lid
of
the
eye
so
imperceptibly
that
it
can
not
be
seen
yet
after
meeting
poulispantzoff
in
this
way
i
was
not
surprised
to
read
in
the
evening
papers
a
few
hours
afterward
that
the
uncle
of
the
young
king
of
siam
had
been
assassinated
the
connection
between
these
two
events
i
am
unfortunately
not
at
liberty
to
explain
the
consequences
to
the
vatican
would
be
too
serious
i
doubt
if
it
could
remain
up
these
however
are
but
passing
incidents
in
a
life
filled
with
danger
and
excitement
they
would
have
remained
unrecorded
and
unrevealed
like
the
rest
of
my
revelations
were
it
not
that
certain
recent
events
have
to
some
extent
removed
the
seal
of
secrecy
from
my
lips
the
death
of
a
certain
royal
sovereign
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
divulge
things
hitherto
undivulgeable
even
now
i
can
only
tell
a
part
a
small
part
of
the
terrific
things
that
i
know
when
more
sovereigns
die
i
can
divulge
more
i
hope
to
keep
on
divulging
at
intervals
for
years
but
i
am
compelled
to
be
cautious
my
relations
with
the
wilhelmstrasse
with
downing
street
and
the
quai
d
orsay
are
so
intimate
and
my
footing
with
the
yildiz
kiosk
and
the
and
childs
restaurants
are
so
delicate
that
a
single
might
prove
to
be
a
false
step
it
is
now
seventeen
years
since
i
entered
the
secret
service
of
the
empire
during
this
time
my
activities
have
taken
me
into
every
quarter
of
the
globe
at
times
even
into
every
eighth
or
sixteenth
of
it
it
was
i
who
first
brought
back
word
to
the
imperial
chancellor
of
the
existence
of
an
entente
between
england
and
france
is
there
an
entente
he
asked
me
trembling
with
excitement
on
my
arrival
at
the
wilhelmstrasse
your
excellency
i
said
there
he
groaned
can
you
stop
it
he
asked
don
t
ask
me
i
said
sadly
where
must
we
strike
demanded
the
chancellor
fetch
me
a
map
i
said
they
did
so
i
placed
my
finger
on
the
map
quick
quick
said
the
chancellor
look
where
his
finger
they
lifted
it
up
morocco
they
cried
i
had
meant
it
for
abyssinia
but
it
was
too
late
to
change
that
night
the
warship
panther
sailed
under
sealed
orders
the
rest
is
history
or
at
least
history
and
geography
in
the
same
way
it
was
i
who
brought
word
to
the
wilhelmstrasse
of
the
between
england
and
russia
in
persia
what
did
you
find
asked
the
chancellor
as
i
laid
aside
the
russian
disguise
in
which
i
had
travelled
a
i
said
he
groaned
they
seem
to
get
all
the
best
words
he
said
i
shall
always
feel
to
my
regret
that
i
am
personally
responsible
for
the
outbreak
of
the
present
war
it
may
have
had
ulterior
causes
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
precipitated
by
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
in
seventeen
years
i
took
a
six
weeks
vacation
in
june
and
july
of
the
consequences
of
this
careless
step
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
yet
i
took
such
precautions
as
i
could
do
you
think
i
asked
that
you
can
preserve
the
for
six
weeks
merely
six
weeks
if
i
stop
spying
and
take
a
rest
we
ll
try
they
answered
remember
i
said
as
i
packed
my
things
keep
the
dardanelles
closed
have
the
sandjak
of
novi
bazaar
properly
patrolled
and
let
the
dobrudja
remain
under
a
till
i
come
two
months
later
while
sitting
sipping
my
coffee
at
a
kurhof
in
the
schwarzwald
i
read
in
the
newspapers
that
a
german
army
had
invaded
france
and
was
fighting
the
french
and
that
the
english
expeditionary
force
had
crossed
the
channel
this
i
said
to
myself
means
as
usual
i
was
right
it
is
needless
for
me
to
recount
here
the
life
of
busy
activity
that
falls
to
a
spy
in
wartime
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
be
here
there
and
everywhere
visiting
all
the
best
hotels
summer
resorts
theatres
and
places
of
amusement
it
was
necessary
moreover
to
act
with
the
utmost
caution
and
to
assume
an
air
of
careless
indolence
in
order
to
lull
suspicion
asleep
with
this
end
in
view
i
made
a
practice
of
never
rising
till
ten
in
the
morning
i
breakfasted
with
great
leisure
and
contented
myself
with
passing
the
morning
in
a
quiet
stroll
taking
care
however
to
keep
my
ears
open
after
lunch
i
generally
feigned
a
light
sleep
keeping
my
ears
shut
a
d
dinner
followed
by
a
visit
to
the
theatre
brought
the
strenuous
day
to
a
close
few
spies
i
venture
to
say
worked
harder
than
i
did
it
was
during
the
third
year
of
the
war
that
i
received
a
peremptory
summons
from
the
head
of
the
imperial
secret
service
at
berlin
baron
fisch
von
gestern
i
want
to
see
you
it
read
nothing
more
in
the
life
of
a
spy
one
learns
to
think
quickly
and
to
think
is
to
act
i
gathered
as
soon
as
i
received
the
despatch
that
for
some
reason
or
other
fisch
von
gestern
was
anxious
to
see
me
having
as
i
instantly
inferred
something
to
say
to
me
this
conjecture
proved
correct
the
baron
rose
at
my
entrance
with
military
correctness
and
shook
hands
are
you
willing
he
inquired
to
undertake
a
mission
to
america
i
am
i
answered
very
good
how
soon
can
you
start
as
soon
as
i
have
paid
the
few
bills
that
i
owe
in
berlin
i
replied
we
can
hardly
wait
for
that
said
my
chief
and
in
case
it
might
excite
comment
you
must
start
very
good
i
said
such
said
the
baron
are
the
kaiser
s
orders
here
is
an
american
passport
and
a
photograph
that
will
answer
the
purpose
the
likeness
is
not
great
but
it
is
but
i
objected
abashed
for
a
moment
this
photograph
is
of
a
man
with
whiskers
and
i
am
unfortunately
the
orders
are
imperative
said
gestern
with
official
hauteur
you
must
start
you
can
grow
whiskers
this
very
good
i
replied
and
now
to
the
business
of
your
mission
continued
the
baron
the
united
states
as
you
have
perhaps
heard
is
making
war
against
i
have
heard
so
i
replied
yes
continued
gestern
the
fact
has
leaked
out
how
we
do
not
know
and
is
being
widely
reported
his
imperial
majesty
has
decided
to
stop
the
war
with
the
united
i
bowed
he
intends
to
send
over
a
secret
treaty
of
the
same
nature
as
the
one
recently
made
with
his
recent
highness
the
recent
czar
of
russia
under
this
treaty
germany
proposes
to
give
to
the
united
states
the
whole
of
equatorial
africa
and
in
return
the
united
states
is
to
give
to
germany
the
whole
of
china
there
are
other
provisions
but
i
need
not
trouble
you
with
them
your
mission
relates
not
to
the
actual
treaty
but
to
the
preparation
of
the
i
bowed
again
you
are
aware
i
presume
continued
the
baron
that
in
all
high
international
dealings
at
least
in
europe
the
ground
has
to
be
prepared
a
hundred
threads
must
be
unravelled
this
the
imperial
government
itself
can
not
stoop
to
do
the
work
must
be
done
by
agents
like
yourself
you
understand
all
this
already
no
doubt
i
indicated
my
assent
these
then
are
your
instructions
said
the
baron
speaking
slowly
and
distinctly
as
if
to
impress
his
words
upon
my
memory
on
your
arrival
in
the
united
states
you
will
follow
the
accredited
methods
that
are
known
to
be
used
by
all
the
best
spies
of
the
highest
diplomacy
you
have
no
doubt
read
some
of
the
books
almost
manuals
of
instruction
that
they
have
written
i
have
read
many
of
them
i
said
very
well
you
will
enter
that
is
to
say
enter
and
move
everywhere
in
the
best
society
mark
specially
please
that
you
must
not
only
it
but
you
must
you
must
if
i
may
put
it
so
get
a
move
i
bowed
you
must
mix
freely
with
the
members
of
the
cabinet
you
must
dine
with
them
this
is
a
most
necessary
matter
and
one
to
be
kept
well
in
mind
dine
with
them
often
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
yourself
familiar
to
them
will
you
do
this
i
will
i
said
very
good
remember
also
that
in
order
to
mask
your
purpose
you
must
constantly
be
seen
with
the
most
fashionable
and
most
beautiful
women
of
the
american
capital
can
you
do
this
can
i
i
said
you
must
if
need
be
and
the
baron
gave
a
most
significant
look
which
was
not
lost
upon
me
carry
on
an
intrigue
with
one
or
better
with
several
of
them
are
you
ready
for
it
more
than
ready
i
said
very
good
but
this
is
only
a
part
you
are
expected
also
to
familiarize
yourself
with
the
leaders
of
the
great
financial
interests
you
are
to
put
yourself
on
such
a
footing
with
them
as
to
borrow
large
sums
of
money
from
them
do
you
object
to
this
no
i
said
frankly
i
do
good
you
will
also
mingle
freely
in
ambassadorial
and
foreign
circles
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
dine
at
least
once
a
week
with
the
british
ambassador
and
now
one
final
word
here
gestern
spoke
with
singular
impressiveness
as
to
the
president
of
the
united
yes
i
said
you
must
mix
with
him
on
a
footing
of
the
most
friendliness
be
at
the
white
house
continually
make
yourself
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
words
the
friend
and
adviser
of
the
president
all
this
i
think
is
clear
in
fact
it
is
only
what
is
done
as
you
know
by
all
the
masters
of
international
precisely
i
said
very
good
and
then
continued
the
baron
as
soon
as
you
find
yourself
sufficiently
with
everybody
or
i
should
say
he
added
in
correction
for
the
baron
shares
fully
in
the
present
german
horror
of
imported
french
words
when
you
find
yourself
sufficiently
in
enggeknupfterverwandtschaft
with
everybody
you
may
then
proceed
to
advance
your
peace
terms
and
now
my
dear
fellow
said
the
baron
with
a
touch
of
genuine
cordiality
one
word
more
are
you
in
need
of
money
yes
i
said
i
thought
so
but
you
will
find
that
you
need
it
less
and
less
as
you
go
on
meantime
and
best
wishes
for
your
such
was
such
is
in
fact
the
mission
with
which
i
am
accredited
i
regard
it
as
by
far
the
most
important
mission
with
which
i
have
been
accredited
by
the
wilhelmstrasse
yet
i
am
compelled
to
admit
that
up
to
the
present
it
has
proved
unsuccessful
my
attempts
to
carry
it
out
have
been
baffled
there
is
something
perhaps
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
republic
which
obstructs
the
working
of
high
diplomacy
for
over
five
months
now
i
have
been
waiting
and
willing
to
dine
with
the
american
cabinet
they
have
not
invited
me
for
four
weeks
i
sat
each
night
waiting
in
the
hotel
in
washington
with
my
suit
on
ready
to
be
asked
they
did
not
come
near
me
nor
have
i
yet
received
an
invitation
from
the
british
embassy
inviting
me
to
an
informal
lunch
or
to
midnight
supper
with
the
ambassador
everybody
who
knows
anything
of
the
inside
working
of
the
international
spy
system
will
realize
that
without
these
invitations
one
can
do
nothing
nor
has
the
president
of
the
united
states
given
any
sign
i
have
sent
ward
to
him
in
cipher
that
i
am
ready
to
dine
with
him
on
any
day
that
may
be
convenient
to
both
of
us
he
has
made
no
move
in
the
matter
under
these
circumstances
an
intrigue
with
any
of
the
leaders
of
fashionable
society
has
proved
impossible
my
attempts
to
approach
them
have
been
misunderstood
in
fact
have
led
to
my
being
invited
to
leave
the
hotel
the
fact
that
i
was
compelled
to
leave
it
owing
to
reasons
that
i
can
not
reveal
without
paying
my
account
has
occasioned
unnecessary
and
dangerous
comment
i
connect
it
in
fact
with
the
singular
attitude
adopted
by
the
hotel
on
my
arrival
in
new
york
to
which
i
have
already
referred
i
have
therefore
been
compelled
to
fall
back
on
revelations
and
disclosures
here
again
i
find
the
american
atmosphere
singularly
uncongenial
i
have
offered
to
reveal
to
the
secretary
of
state
the
entire
family
history
of
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
for
fifty
dollars
he
says
it
is
not
worth
it
i
have
offered
to
the
british
embassy
the
inside
story
of
the
abdication
of
constantine
for
five
dollars
they
say
they
know
it
and
knew
it
before
it
happened
i
have
offered
for
little
more
than
a
nominal
sum
to
blacken
the
character
of
every
reigning
family
in
germany
i
am
told
that
it
is
not
necessary
meantime
as
it
is
impossible
to
return
to
central
europe
i
expect
to
open
either
a
fruit
store
or
a
peanut
stand
very
shortly
in
this
great
metropolis
i
imagine
that
many
of
my
former
colleagues
will
soon
be
doing
the
same
ii
father
knickerbocker
a
fantasy
it
happened
quite
recently
i
think
it
must
have
been
on
april
the
second
of
that
i
was
making
the
long
pilgrimage
on
a
from
the
remote
place
where
i
dwell
to
the
city
of
new
york
and
as
we
drew
near
the
city
and
day
darkened
into
night
i
had
fallen
to
reading
from
a
quaint
old
copy
of
washington
irving
s
immortal
sketches
of
father
knickerbocker
and
of
the
little
town
where
once
he
dwelt
i
had
picked
up
the
book
i
know
not
where
very
old
it
apparently
was
and
made
in
england
for
there
was
pasted
across
the
of
it
an
extract
from
some
ancient
magazine
or
journal
of
a
century
ago
giving
what
was
evidently
a
description
of
the
new
york
of
that
day
from
reading
the
book
i
turned
my
head
still
filled
with
the
vision
of
father
knickerbocker
and
sleepy
hollow
and
tarrytown
to
examine
the
extract
i
read
it
in
a
sort
of
for
the
dark
had
fallen
outside
and
the
drowsy
throbbing
of
the
running
train
attuned
one
s
mind
to
dreaming
of
the
past
the
town
of
new
york
so
ran
the
extract
pasted
in
the
little
book
is
pleasantly
situated
at
the
lower
extremity
of
the
island
of
manhattan
its
recent
progress
has
been
so
amazing
that
it
is
now
reputed
on
good
authority
to
harbour
at
least
twenty
thousand
souls
viewed
from
the
sea
it
presents
even
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
a
striking
appearance
owing
to
the
number
and
beauty
of
its
church
spires
which
rise
high
above
the
roofs
and
foliage
and
give
to
the
place
its
characteristically
religious
aspect
the
extreme
end
of
the
island
is
heavily
fortified
with
cannon
commanding
a
range
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
forbidding
all
access
to
the
harbour
behind
this
battery
a
neat
greensward
affords
a
pleasant
promenade
where
the
citizens
are
accustomed
to
walk
with
their
wives
every
morning
after
how
i
should
like
to
have
seen
it
i
murmured
to
myself
as
i
laid
the
book
aside
for
a
moment
the
battery
the
harbour
and
the
citizens
walking
with
their
wives
their
own
wives
on
the
then
i
read
on
from
the
town
itself
a
wide
thoroughfare
the
albany
post
road
runs
meandering
northward
through
the
fields
it
is
known
for
some
distance
under
the
name
of
the
broad
way
and
is
so
wide
that
four
moving
vehicles
are
said
to
be
able
to
pass
abreast
the
broad
way
especially
in
the
springtime
when
it
is
redolent
with
the
scent
of
clover
and
is
a
favourite
evening
promenade
for
the
citizens
with
their
wives
after
church
here
they
may
be
seen
any
evening
strolling
toward
the
high
ground
overlooking
the
hudson
their
wives
on
one
arm
a
spyglass
under
the
other
in
order
to
view
what
they
can
see
down
the
broad
way
may
be
seen
moving
also
droves
of
young
lambs
with
their
shepherds
proceeding
to
the
market
while
here
and
there
a
goat
stands
quietly
munching
beside
the
road
and
gazing
at
the
it
seems
i
muttered
to
myself
as
i
read
in
some
ways
but
little
changed
after
the
town
so
the
extract
continued
is
not
without
its
amusements
a
commodious
theatre
presents
with
great
success
every
saturday
night
the
plays
of
shakespeare
alternating
with
sacred
concerts
the
new
yorker
indeed
is
celebrated
throughout
the
provinces
for
his
love
of
amusement
and
late
hours
the
theatres
do
not
come
out
until
long
after
nine
o
clock
while
for
the
gayer
habitues
two
excellent
restaurants
serve
fish
macaroni
prunes
and
other
delicacies
till
long
past
ten
at
night
the
dress
of
the
new
yorker
is
correspondingly
gay
in
the
other
provinces
the
men
wear
nothing
but
plain
suits
of
a
rusty
black
whereas
in
new
york
there
are
frequently
seen
suits
of
brown
and
even
of
the
costumes
of
the
new
york
women
are
equally
daring
and
differ
notably
from
the
quiet
dress
of
new
england
in
fine
it
is
commonly
said
in
the
provinces
that
a
new
yorker
can
be
recognized
anywhere
with
his
wife
by
their
modish
costumes
their
easy
manners
and
their
willingness
to
spend
money
two
three
and
even
five
cents
being
paid
for
the
smallest
dear
me
i
thought
as
i
paused
a
moment
in
my
reading
so
they
had
begun
it
even
the
whole
spirit
of
the
place
the
account
continued
has
recently
been
admirably
embodied
in
literary
form
by
an
american
writer
washington
irving
not
to
be
confounded
with
george
washington
his
creation
of
father
knickerbocker
is
so
lifelike
that
it
may
be
said
to
embody
the
very
spirit
of
new
york
the
accompanying
woodcut
which
was
drawn
on
wood
especially
for
this
periodical
recalls
at
once
the
delightful
figure
of
father
knickerbocker
the
new
yorkers
of
are
accustomed
indeed
to
laugh
at
irving
s
fancy
and
to
say
that
knickerbocker
belongs
to
a
day
long
since
past
yet
those
who
know
tell
us
that
the
image
of
the
amiable
old
gentleman
kindly
but
irascible
generous
and
yet
frugal
loving
his
town
and
seeing
little
beyond
it
may
be
held
once
and
for
all
to
typify
the
spirit
of
the
place
without
reference
to
any
particular
time
or
father
knickerbocker
i
murmured
as
i
felt
myself
dozing
off
to
sleep
rocked
by
the
motion
of
the
car
father
knickerbocker
how
strange
if
he
could
be
here
again
and
see
the
great
city
as
we
know
it
now
how
different
from
his
day
how
i
should
love
to
go
round
new
york
and
show
it
to
him
as
it
so
i
mused
and
dozed
till
the
very
rumble
of
the
wheels
seemed
to
piece
together
in
little
snatches
father
knickerbocker
father
knickerbocker
the
battery
the
battery
citizens
walking
with
their
wives
with
their
wives
their
own
wives
until
presently
i
imagine
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
altogether
and
knew
no
more
till
my
journey
was
over
and
i
found
myself
among
the
roar
and
bustle
of
the
concourse
of
the
grand
central
and
there
lo
and
behold
waiting
to
meet
me
was
father
knickerbocker
himself
i
know
not
how
it
happened
by
what
queer
freak
of
hallucination
or
by
what
actual
miracle
let
those
explain
it
who
deal
in
such
things
but
there
he
stood
before
me
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
a
smile
of
greeting
father
knickerbocker
himself
the
embodied
spirit
of
new
york
how
strange
i
said
i
was
just
reading
about
you
in
a
book
on
the
train
and
imagining
how
much
i
should
like
actually
to
meet
you
and
to
show
you
round
new
the
old
man
laughed
in
a
jaunty
way
show
round
he
said
why
my
dear
boy
live
i
know
you
did
long
ago
i
said
i
do
still
said
father
knickerbocker
i
ve
never
left
the
place
i
ll
show
around
but
wait
a
bit
don
t
carry
that
handbag
i
ll
get
a
boy
to
call
a
porter
to
fetch
a
man
to
take
oh
i
can
carry
it
i
said
it
s
a
mere
my
dear
fellow
said
father
knickerbocker
a
little
testily
i
thought
i
m
as
democratic
and
as
plain
and
simple
as
any
man
in
this
city
but
when
it
comes
to
carrying
a
handbag
in
full
sight
of
all
this
crowd
why
as
i
said
to
peter
stuyvesant
about
about
here
a
misty
look
seemed
to
come
over
the
old
gentleman
s
face
about
two
hundred
years
ago
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
will
it
can
t
be
done
it
s
not
up
to
while
he
was
saying
this
father
knickerbocker
had
beckoned
to
a
group
of
porters
take
this
gentleman
s
handbag
he
said
and
you
carry
his
newspapers
and
you
take
his
umbrella
here
s
a
quarter
for
you
and
a
quarter
for
you
and
a
quarter
for
you
one
of
you
go
in
front
and
lead
the
way
to
a
don
t
you
know
the
way
yourself
i
asked
in
a
of
course
i
do
but
i
generally
like
to
walk
with
a
boy
in
front
of
me
we
all
do
only
the
cheap
people
nowadays
find
their
own
father
knickerbocker
had
taken
my
arm
and
was
walking
along
in
a
queer
excited
fashion
senile
and
yet
with
a
sort
of
forced
youthfulness
in
his
gait
and
manner
now
then
he
said
get
into
this
can
t
we
i
asked
impossible
said
the
old
gentleman
it
s
five
blocks
to
where
we
are
as
we
took
our
seats
i
looked
again
at
my
companion
this
time
more
closely
father
knickerbocker
he
certainly
was
yet
somehow
strangely
transformed
from
my
pictured
fancy
of
the
sleepy
hollow
days
his
antique
coat
with
its
wide
skirt
had
it
seemed
assumed
a
modish
cut
as
if
in
imitation
of
the
spring
overcoat
of
the
young
man
about
town
his
hat
was
set
at
a
rakish
angle
till
it
looked
almost
like
an
fedora
the
great
stick
that
he
used
to
carry
had
somehow
changed
itself
into
the
curved
of
a
broadway
lounger
the
solid
old
shoes
with
their
wide
buckles
were
gone
in
their
place
he
wore
narrow
slippers
of
patent
leather
of
which
he
seemed
inordinately
proud
for
he
had
stuck
his
feet
up
ostentatiously
on
the
seat
opposite
his
eyes
followed
my
glance
toward
his
shoes
for
the
he
said
the
old
ones
were
no
good
have
a
cigarette
these
are
armenian
or
would
you
prefer
a
honolulan
or
a
nigerian
now
he
resumed
when
we
had
lighted
our
cigarettes
what
would
you
like
to
do
first
dance
the
tango
hear
some
hawaiian
music
drink
cocktails
or
what
why
what
i
should
like
most
of
all
father
knickerbocker
but
he
interrupted
me
there
s
a
devilish
fine
woman
look
the
tall
blonde
one
give
me
blondes
every
time
here
he
smacked
his
lips
by
gad
sir
the
women
in
this
town
seem
to
get
finer
every
century
what
were
you
saying
why
father
knickerbocker
i
began
but
he
interrupted
me
again
my
dear
fellow
he
said
may
i
ask
you
not
to
call
me
knickerbocker
but
i
thought
you
were
so
old
i
said
humbly
old
me
oh
i
don
t
know
why
dash
it
there
are
plenty
of
men
as
old
as
i
am
dancing
the
tango
here
every
night
pray
call
me
if
you
don
t
mind
just
knickerbocker
or
simply
knicky
most
of
the
other
boys
call
me
knicky
now
what
s
it
to
be
most
of
all
i
said
i
should
like
to
go
to
some
quiet
place
and
have
a
talk
about
the
old
right
he
said
we
re
going
to
just
the
place
now
nice
quiet
dinner
a
good
quiet
orchestra
hawaiian
but
quiet
and
lots
of
here
he
smacked
his
lips
again
and
nudged
me
with
his
elbow
lots
of
women
bunches
of
them
do
you
like
women
why
knickerbocker
i
said
hesitatingly
i
suppose
i
the
old
man
sniggered
as
he
poked
me
again
in
the
ribs
you
bet
you
do
you
dog
he
chuckled
we
do
for
me
i
confess
it
sir
i
can
t
sit
down
to
dinner
without
plenty
of
women
stacks
of
them
all
round
meantime
the
taxi
had
stopped
i
was
about
to
open
the
door
and
get
out
wait
wait
said
father
knickerbocker
his
hand
upon
my
arm
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
i
ll
see
somebody
in
a
minute
who
ll
let
us
out
for
fifty
cents
none
of
us
here
ever
gets
in
or
out
of
anything
by
ourselves
it
s
bad
form
ah
here
he
is
a
moment
later
we
had
passed
through
the
portals
of
a
great
restaurant
and
found
ourselves
surrounded
with
all
the
colour
and
tumult
of
a
new
york
dinner
la
a
burst
of
wild
music
pounded
and
thrummed
out
on
ukuleles
by
a
group
of
yellow
men
in
hawaiian
costume
filled
the
room
helping
to
drown
or
perhaps
only
serving
to
accentuate
the
babel
of
talk
and
the
clatter
of
dishes
that
arose
on
every
side
men
in
evening
dress
and
women
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
to
a
degree
were
seated
at
little
tables
blowing
blue
smoke
into
the
air
and
drinking
green
and
yellow
drinks
from
glasses
with
thin
stems
a
troupe
of
performers
shouted
and
leaped
on
a
little
stage
at
the
side
of
the
room
unheeded
by
the
crowd
ha
ha
said
knickerbocker
as
we
drew
in
our
chairs
to
a
table
some
place
eh
there
s
a
peach
look
at
her
or
do
you
like
better
that
brunette
next
to
her
knickerbocker
was
staring
about
the
room
gazing
at
the
women
with
open
effrontery
and
a
senile
leer
upon
his
face
i
felt
ashamed
of
him
yet
oddly
enough
no
one
about
us
seemed
in
the
least
disturbed
now
what
cocktail

have
said
my
companion
there

a
new

week

know
what
it
is
but
by
gad
sir
it
s
three
dollars
a
portion
all
right
i
said
you
order
the
knickerbocker
proceeded
to
do
so
the
obsequiously
at
his
side
and
his
long
finger
indicating
on
the
menu
everything
that
seemed
most
expensive
and
that
carried
the
most
incomprehensible
name
when
he
had
finished
he
turned
to
me
again
now
he
said
let
s
tell
me
i
said
about
the
old
days
and
the
old
times
on
ah
yes
he
answered
the
old
days
you
mean
ten
years
ago
before
the
winter
garden
was
opened
we
ve
been
going
ahead
sir
going
ahead
why
ten
years
ago
there
was
practically
nothing
sir
above
times
square
and
look
at
it
i
began
to
realize
that
father
knickerbocker
old
as
he
was
had
forgotten
all
the
earlier
times
with
which
i
associated
his
memory
there
was
nothing
left
but
the
and
the
gardens
the
palm
rooms
and
the
ukuleles
of
behind
that
his
mind
refused
to
travel
don
t
you
remember
i
asked
the
apple
orchards
and
the
quiet
groves
of
trees
that
used
to
line
broadway
long
ago
groves
he
said
i
ll
show
you
a
grove
a
coconut
grove
here
he
winked
over
his
wineglass
in
a
senile
fashion
that
has
beaten
from
here
to
thus
he
babbled
on
all
through
our
meal
his
talk
continued
of
and
dances
or
and
midnight
suppers
of
blondes
and
brunettes
peaches
and
dreams
and
all
the
while
his
eye
roved
incessantly
among
the
tables
resting
on
the
women
with
a
bold
stare
at
times
he
would
indicate
and
point
out
for
me
some
of
what
he
called
the
representative
people
present
notice
that
man
at
the
second
table
he
would
whisper
across
to
me
he
s
worth
all
the
way
to
ten
millions
made
it
in
government
contracts
they
tried
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
last
fall
but
they
can
t
get
him
he
s
too
smart
for
them
i
ll
introduce
you
to
him
presently
see
the
man
with
him
that
s
his
lawyer
biggest
crook
in
america
they
say
we
ll
meet
him
after
then
he
would
suddenly
break
off
and
exclaim
egad
sir
there
s
a
fine
bunch
of
them
as
another
bevy
of
girls
came
trooping
out
upon
the
stage
i
wonder
i
murmured
if
there
is
nothing
left
of
him
but
this
has
all
the
fine
old
spirit
gone
is
it
all
drowned
out
in
wine
and
suffocated
in
the
foul
atmosphere
of
luxury
then
suddenly
i
looked
up
at
my
companion
and
i
saw
to
my
surprise
that
his
whole
face
and
manner
had
altered
his
hand
was
clenched
tight
on
the
edge
of
the
table
his
eyes
looked
before
him
through
and
beyond
the
riotous
crowd
all
about
him
into
vacancy
into
the
far
past
back
into
memories
that
i
thought
forgotten
his
face
had
altered
the
senile
leering
look
was
gone
and
in
its
place
the
face
of
the
knickerbocker
of
a
century
ago
he
was
speaking
in
a
strange
voice
deep
and
strong
listen
he
said
listen
do
you
hear
it
there
far
out
at
sea
ships
guns
listen
they
re
calling
for
help
ships
guns
far
out
at
sea
he
had
clasped
me
by
the
arm
quick
to
the
battery
they
ll
need
every
man
they
ll
then
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
his
look
changed
again
the
vision
died
out
of
his
eyes
what
was
i
saying
he
asked
ah
yes
this
old
brandy
a
very
special
brand
they
keep
it
for
me
here
a
dollar
a
glass
they
know
me
here
he
added
in
his
fatuous
way
all
the
waiters
know
me
the
headwaiter
always
knows
me
the
minute
i
come
into
the
room
keeps
a
chair
for
me
now
try
this
brandy
and
then
presently
we
ll
move
on
and
see
what
s
doing
at
some
of
the
but
somehow
in
spite
of
himself
my
companion
seemed
to
be
unable
to
bring
himself
fully
back
into
the
consciousness
of
the
scene
before
him
the
look
still
lingered
in
his
eyes
presently
he
turned
and
spoke
to
me
in
a
low
confidential
tone
was
i
talking
to
myself
a
moment
ago
he
asked
yes
ah
i
feared
i
was
do
you
know
i
don
t
mind
telling
it
to
you
lately
i
ve
had
a
strange
queer
feeling
that
comes
over
me
at
times
as
if
were
something
i
don
t
know
what
i
suppose
he
continued
with
a
false
attempt
at
resuming
his
fatuous
manner
i
m
going
the
pace
a
little
too
hard
eh
makes
one
fanciful
but
the
fact
is
at
times
he
spoke
gravely
again
i
feel
as
if
there
were
something
happening
something
knickerbocker
i
said
earnestly
father
knickerbocker
don
t
you
know
that
something
happening
that
this
very
evening
as
we
are
sitting
here
in
all
this
riot
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
to
come
before
congress
on
the
most
solemn
mission
that
ever
but
my
speech
fell
unheeded
knickerbocker
had
picked
up
his
glass
again
and
was
leering
over
it
at
a
bevy
of
girls
dancing
upon
the
stage
look
at
that
girl
he
interrupted
quickly
the
one
dancing
at
the
end
what
do
you
think
of
her
eh
some
peach
knickerbocker
broke
off
suddenly
for
at
this
moment
our
ears
caught
the
sound
of
a
noise
a
distant
tumult
as
it
were
far
down
the
street
and
growing
nearer
the
old
man
had
drawn
himself
erect
in
his
seat
his
hand
to
his
ear
listening
as
he
caught
the
sound
out
on
the
broad
way
he
said
instinctively
calling
it
by
its
ancient
name
as
if
a
flood
of
memories
were
upon
him
do
you
hear
it
listen
listen
what
is
it
i
ve
heard
that
sound
before
i
ve
heard
every
sound
on
the
broad
way
these
two
centuries
back
what
is
it
i
seem
to
know
it
the
sound
and
tumult
as
of
running
feet
and
of
many
voices
crying
came
louder
from
the
street
the
people
at
the
tables
had
turned
in
their
seats
to
listen
the
music
of
the
orchestra
had
stopped
the
waiters
had
thrown
back
the
heavy
curtains
from
the
windows
and
the
people
were
crowding
to
them
to
look
out
into
the
street
knickerbocker
had
risen
in
his
place
his
eyes
looked
toward
the
windows
but
his
gaze
was
fixed
on
vacancy
as
with
one
who
sees
a
vision
passing
i
know
the
sound
he
cried
i
see
it
all
again
look
can
t
you
see
them
it
s
massachusetts
soldiers
marching
south
to
the
war
can
t
you
hear
the
beating
of
the
drums
and
the
shrill
calling
of
the
fife
the
regiments
from
the
north
the
first
to
come
i
saw
them
pass
here
where
we
are
sitting
sixty
years
ago
knickerbocker
paused
a
moment
his
hand
still
extended
in
the
air
and
then
with
a
great
light
upon
his
face
he
cried
i
know
it
now
i
know
what
it
meant
the
feeling
that
has
haunted
me
the
sounds
i
kept
hearing
the
guns
of
the
ships
at
sea
and
the
voices
calling
in
distress
i
know
now
it
means
sir
it
means
but
as
he
spoke
a
great
cry
came
up
from
the
street
and
burst
in
at
the
doors
and
windows
echoing
in
a
single
word
war
war
the
message
of
the
president
is
for
war
war
cried
father
knickerbocker
rising
to
his
full
height
stern
and
majestic
and
shouting
in
a
stentorian
tone
that
echoed
through
the
great
room
war
war
to
your
places
every
one
of
you
be
done
with
your
idle
luxury
out
with
the
glare
of
your
lights
begone
you
painted
women
and
worthless
men
to
your
places
every
man
of
you
to
the
battery
man
the
guns
stand
to
it
every
one
of
you
for
the
defence
of
america
for
our
new
york
new
york
then
with
the
sound
new
york
new
york
still
echoing
in
my
ears
i
woke
up
the
vision
of
my
dream
was
gone
i
was
still
on
the
seat
of
the
car
where
i
had
dozed
asleep
the
book
upon
my
knee
the
train
had
arrived
at
the
depot
and
the
porters
were
calling
into
the
doorway
of
the
car
new
york
new
york
all
about
me
was
the
stir
and
hubbub
of
the
great
depot
but
loud
over
all
it
was
heard
the
call
of
the
newsboys
crying
war
war
the
president
s
message
is
for
war
late
extra
war
war
and
i
knew
that
a
great
nation
had
cast
aside
the
bonds
of
sloth
and
luxury
and
was
girding
itself
to
join
in
the
fight
for
the
free
democracy
of
all
mankind
iii
the
prophet
in
our
midst
the
eminent
authority
looked
around
at
the
little
group
of
us
seated
about
him
at
the
club
he
was
telling
us
or
beginning
to
tell
us
about
the
outcome
of
the
war
it
was
a
thing
we
wanted
to
know
we
were
listening
attentively
we
felt
that
we
were
getting
i
doubt
very
much
he
said
whether
downing
street
realizes
the
enormous
power
which
the
quai
d
orsay
has
over
the
yildiz
so
do
i
i
said
what
is
it
but
he
hardly
noticed
the
interruption
you
ve
got
to
remember
he
went
on
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
yildiz
the
wilhelmstrasse
is
just
a
thing
of
quite
so
i
said
of
course
he
added
the
ballplatz
is
quite
altogether
different
i
admitted
and
mind
you
he
said
the
ballplatz
itself
can
be
largely
moved
from
the
quirinal
through
the
why
of
course
it
can
i
agreed
with
as
much
relief
in
my
tone
as
i
could
put
into
it
after
all
what
simpler
way
of
moving
the
ballplatz
than
that
the
eminent
authority
took
another
sip
at
his
tea
and
looked
round
at
us
through
his
spectacles
it
was
i
who
was
taking
on
myself
to
do
most
of
the
answering
because
it
was
i
who
had
brought
him
there
and
invited
the
other
men
to
meet
him
he
s
coming
round
at
five
i
had
said
do
come
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
meet
him
he
knows
more
about
the
european
situation
and
the
probable
solution
than
any
other
man
naturally
they
came
gladly
they
wanted
to
know
as
everybody
wants
to
know
how
the
war
will
end
they
were
just
ordinary
plain
men
like
myself
i
could
see
that
they
were
a
little
mystified
perhaps
disappointed
they
would
have
liked
just
as
i
would
to
ask
a
few
plain
questions
such
as
can
the
italians
knock
the
stuff
out
of
the
austrians
are
the
rumanians
getting
licked
or
not
how
many
submarines
has
germany
got
anyway
such
questions
in
fact
as
we
are
accustomed
to
put
up
to
one
another
every
day
at
lunch
and
to
answer
out
of
the
morning
paper
as
it
was
we
didn
t
seem
to
be
getting
anywhere
no
one
spoke
the
silence
began
to
be
even
a
little
uncomfortable
it
was
broken
by
my
friend
rapley
who
is
in
wholesale
hardware
and
who
has
all
the
intellectual
bravery
that
goes
with
it
he
asked
the
authority
straight
out
the
question
that
we
all
wanted
to
put
just
what
do
you
mean
by
the
ballplatz
what
is
the
ballplatz
the
authority
smiled
an
engaging
smile
precisely
he
said
i
see
your
drift
exactly
you
say
what
the
ballplatz
i
reply
quite
frankly
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
answer
probably
one
could
best
define
it
as
the
driving
power
behind
the
i
see
said
rapley
though
the
plain
fact
is
that
ever
since
the
herzegovinian
embroglio
the
ballplatz
is
little
more
than
a
counterpoise
to
the
ah
said
rapley
indeed
as
everybody
knows
the
whole
relationship
of
the
ballplatz
with
the
nevski
prospekt
has
emanated
from
the
this
was
a
thing
which
personally
i
had
known
but
i
said
nothing
neither
did
the
other
men
they
continued
smoking
looking
as
innocent
as
they
could
don
t
misunderstand
me
said
the
authority
when
i
speak
of
the
nevski
prospekt
i
am
not
referring
in
any
way
to
the
tsarskoe
no
no
we
all
agreed
no
doubt
there
were
as
we
see
it
plainly
now
under
currents
in
all
directions
from
the
tsarskoe
we
all
seemed
to
suggest
by
our
attitude
that
these
undercurrents
were
sucking
at
our
very
feet
but
the
tsarskoe
selo
said
the
authority
is
now
definitely
we
were
glad
of
that
we
shifted
our
feet
back
into
attitudes
of
ease
i
felt
that
it
was
time
to
ask
a
leading
question
do
you
think
i
said
that
germany
will
be
broken
up
by
the
war
you
mean
germany
in
what
sense
are
you
thinking
of
preuszenthum
are
you
referring
to
junkerismus
no
i
said
quite
truthfully
neither
of
ah
said
the
authority
i
see
you
mean
germany
as
a
souverantat
embodied
in
a
that
s
it
i
said
then
it
s
rather
hard
said
the
eminent
authority
to
answer
your
question
in
plain
terms
but
i
ll
try
one
thing
of
course
is
certain
goes
it
does
eh
oh
yes
absolutely
this
is
the
end
of
i
mean
to
say
here
we
ve
had
that
is
the
as
a
sort
of
fantasmus
in
front
of
teutonism
ever
since
the
authority
looked
all
round
us
in
that
searching
way
he
had
we
all
tried
to
look
like
men
seeing
a
fantasmus
and
disgusted
at
it
so
you
see
he
went
on
is
done
i
suppose
it
is
i
said
i
didn
t
know
just
whether
to
speak
with
regret
or
not
i
heard
rapley
murmur
i
guess
and
there
is
not
a
doubt
continued
the
authority
that
when
goes
grossdeutschthum
goes
with
oh
sure
to
we
all
murmured
well
then
there
you
are
what
is
the
result
for
germany
why
the
thing
s
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
in
fact
you
re
driven
to
it
by
the
sheer
logic
of
the
situation
there
is
only
outcome
the
authority
was
speaking
very
deliberately
he
even
paused
at
this
point
and
lighted
a
cigarette
while
we
all
listened
breathlessly
we
felt
that
we
had
got
the
thing
to
a
focus
at
last
only
one
outcome
a
great
heavens
i
said
not
a
staatenbund
undoubtedly
said
the
authority
puffing
quietly
at
his
cigarette
as
if
personally
he
wouldn
t
lift
a
finger
to
stop
the
staatenbund
if
he
could
that
s
the
end
of
it
a
staatenbund
in
other
words
we
are
back
where
we
were
before
the
vienna
congress
at
this
he
chuckled
heartily
to
himself
so
the
rest
of
us
laughed
too
the
thing
was
absurd
but
the
authority
who
was
a
man
of
nice
distinctions
and
genuinely
anxious
to
instruct
us
was
evidently
afraid
that
he
had
overstated
things
a
little
mind
you
he
said
there
ll
be
left
certainly
the
zollverein
and
either
the
ausgleich
or
something
very
like
all
of
the
men
gave
a
sort
of
sigh
of
relief
it
was
certainly
something
to
have
at
least
a
sort
of
resemblance
or
appearance
of
the
ausgleich
among
us
we
felt
that
we
were
getting
on
one
could
see
that
a
number
of
the
men
were
on
the
brink
of
asking
questions
what
about
rumania
asked
nelles
he
is
a
banker
and
interested
in
government
bonds
is
this
the
end
of
it
no
said
the
authority
it
s
not
the
end
of
rumania
but
it
the
end
of
rumanian
that
settled
nelles
what
about
the
turks
asked
rapley
the
turks
or
rather
i
suppose
it
would
be
more
proper
to
say
the
osmanli
as
that
is
no
doubt
what
you
mean
rapley
nodded
well
speaking
personally
i
should
say
that
there
s
no
difficulty
in
a
permanent
settlement
in
that
quarter
if
i
were
drawing
up
the
terms
of
a
treaty
of
peace
meant
to
be
really
lasting
i
should
lay
down
three
absolute
bases
the
rest
needn
t
matter
the
authority
paused
a
moment
and
then
proceeded
to
count
off
the
three
conditions
of
peace
on
his
fingers
these
would
be
first
the
evacuation
of
the
sandjak
second
an
international
guarantee
for
the
capitulations
and
third
for
internal
matters
an
arrangement
along
the
lines
of
the
original
firman
of
midhat
a
murmur
of
complete
satisfaction
went
round
the
group
i
don
t
say
continued
the
eminent
authority
that
there
wouldn
t
be
other
minor
matters
to
adjust
but
they
would
be
a
mere
detail
you
ask
me
for
instance
for
a
or
at
least
a
gendarmerie
in
the
albanian
hinterland
very
good
i
grant
it
you
at
once
you
retain
if
you
like
you
abolish
the
cypriotic
suzerainty
of
the
porte
all
right
these
are
matters
of
we
all
assumed
a
look
of
utter
indifference
but
what
about
the
dardanelles
would
you
have
them
fixed
so
that
ships
could
go
through
or
not
asked
rapley
he
is
a
plain
man
not
easily
put
down
and
liking
a
plain
answer
he
got
it
the
dardanelles
said
the
authority
could
easily
be
denationalized
under
a
quadrilateral
guarantee
to
be
made
a
pars
materia
of
the
pactum
that
ought
to
hold
them
i
murmured
the
authority
felt
now
that
he
had
pretty
well
settled
the
map
of
europe
he
rose
and
shook
hands
with
us
all
around
very
cordially
we
did
not
try
to
detain
him
we
felt
that
time
like
his
was
too
valuable
to
be
wasted
on
things
like
us
well
i
tell
you
said
rapley
as
we
settled
back
into
our
chairs
when
the
great
authority
had
gone
my
own
opinion
boys
is
that
the
united
states
and
england
can
trim
germany
and
austria
any
day
in
the
week
and
twice
on
after
which
somebody
else
said
i
wonder
how
many
of
these
submarines
germany
has
anyway
and
then
we
drifted
back
into
the
humbler
kind
of
war
talk
that
we
have
been
carrying
on
for
three
years
but
later
as
we
walked
home
together
rapley
said
to
me
that
fellow
threw
a
lot
of
light
on
things
in
europe
didn
t
he
and
i
answered
what
liars
we
all
are
iv
personal
adventures
in
the
spirit
world
i
do
not
write
what
follows
with
the
expectation
of
convincing
or
converting
anybody
we
spiritualists
or
spiritists
we
call
ourselves
both
or
either
never
ask
anybody
to
believe
us
if
they
do
well
and
good
if
not
all
right
our
attitude
simply
is
that
facts
are
facts
there
they
are
believe
them
or
not
as
you
like
as
i
said
the
other
night
in
conversation
with
aristotle
and
john
bunyan
and
george
washington
and
a
few
others
why
should
anybody
believe
us
aristotle
i
recollect
said
that
all
that
he
wished
was
that
everybody
should
know
how
happy
he
was
and
washington
said
that
for
his
part
if
people
only
knew
how
bright
and
beautiful
it
all
was
where
he
was
they
would
willingly
indeed
gladly
pay
the
mere
dollar
itself
only
a
nominal
fee
that
it
cost
to
talk
to
him
bunyan
i
remember
added
that
he
himself
was
quite
happy
but
as
i
say
i
never
ask
anybody
to
believe
me
the
more
so
as
i
was
once
an
absolute
sceptic
myself
as
i
see
it
now
i
was
prejudiced
the
mere
fact
that
spiritual
seances
and
the
services
of
a
medium
involved
the
payment
of
money
condemned
the
whole
thing
in
my
eyes
i
did
not
realize
as
i
do
now
that
these
like
anybody
else
have
got
to
live
otherwise
they
would
die
and
become
spirits
nor
would
i
now
place
these
disclosures
before
the
public
eyes
were
if
not
that
i
think
that
in
the
present
crisis
they
will
prove
of
value
to
the
allied
cause
but
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
my
own
conversion
to
spiritualism
came
about
like
that
of
so
many
others
through
the
more
or
less
casual
remark
of
a
friend
noticing
me
one
day
gloomy
and
depressed
this
friend
remarked
to
me
have
you
any
belief
in
spiritualism
had
it
come
from
anyone
else
i
should
have
turned
the
question
aside
with
a
sneer
but
it
so
happens
that
i
owe
a
great
deal
of
gratitude
to
this
particular
friend
it
was
he
who
at
a
time
when
i
was
so
afflicted
with
rheumatism
that
i
could
scarcely
leap
five
feet
into
the
air
without
pain
said
to
me
one
day
quite
casually
have
you
ever
tried
pyro
for
your
rheumatism
one
month
later
i
could
leap
ten
feet
in
the
air
had
i
been
able
to
without
the
slightest
malaise
the
same
man
i
may
add
hearing
me
one
day
exclaiming
to
myself
oh
if
there
were
anything
that
would
remove
the
stains
from
my
clothes
said
to
me
very
simply
and
quietly
have
you
ever
washed
them
in
luxo
it
was
he
too
who
noticing
a
haggard
look
on
my
face
after
breakfast
one
morning
inquired
immediately
what
i
had
been
eating
for
breakfast
after
which
with
a
simplicity
and
directness
which
i
shall
never
forget
he
said
why
not
eat
humpo
nor
can
i
ever
forget
my
feeling
on
another
occasion
when
hearing
me
exclaim
aloud
oh
if
there
were
only
something
invented
for
removing
the
proteins
and
amygdaloids
from
a
carbonized
diet
and
leaving
only
the
pure
nitrogenous
elements
seized
my
hand
in
his
and
said
in
a
voice
thrilled
with
emotion
there
is
it
has
the
reader
will
understand
therefore
that
a
question
or
query
from
such
a
friend
was
not
to
be
put
lightly
aside
when
he
asked
if
i
believed
in
spiritualism
i
answered
with
perfect
courtesy
to
be
quite
frank
i
do
there
was
silence
between
us
for
a
time
and
then
my
friend
said
have
you
ever
given
it
a
trial
i
paused
a
moment
as
the
idea
was
a
novel
one
no
i
answered
to
be
quite
candid
i
have
neither
of
us
spoke
for
perhaps
twenty
minutes
after
this
when
my
friend
said
have
you
anything
against
it
i
thought
awhile
and
then
i
said
yes
i
my
friend
remained
silent
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
then
he
asked
what
i
meditated
for
some
time
then
i
said
this
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
thing
is
done
for
money
how
utterly
unnatural
it
is
to
call
up
the
dead
one
s
let
us
say
and
pay
money
for
talking
to
precisely
said
my
friend
without
a
moment
s
pause
i
thought
so
now
suppose
i
could
bring
you
into
contact
with
the
spirit
world
through
a
medium
or
through
different
without
there
being
any
question
of
money
other
than
a
merely
nominal
fee
the
money
being
as
it
were
left
out
of
count
and
regarded
as
only
so
to
speak
nominal
something
given
merely
and
under
these
circumstances
will
you
try
the
experiment
i
rose
and
took
my
friend
s
hand
my
dear
fellow
i
said
i
not
only
will
but
i
from
this
conversation
dated
my
connection
with
spiritualism
which
has
since
opened
for
me
a
new
world
it
would
be
out
of
place
for
me
to
indicate
the
particular
address
or
the
particular
methods
employed
by
the
agency
to
which
my
friend
introduced
me
i
am
anxious
to
avoid
anything
approaching
a
commercial
tinge
in
what
i
write
moreover
their
advertisement
can
be
seen
along
with
many
others
all
i
am
sure
just
as
honourable
and
just
as
trustworthy
in
the
columns
of
any
daily
newspaper
as
everybody
knows
many
methods
are
employed
the
tapping
of
a
table
the
movement
of
a
ouija
board
or
the
voice
of
a
trance
medium
are
only
a
few
among
the
many
devices
by
which
the
spirits
now
enter
into
communication
with
us
but
in
my
own
case
the
method
used
was
not
only
simplicity
itself
but
was
so
framed
as
to
carry
with
it
the
proof
of
its
own
genuineness
one
had
merely
to
speak
into
the
receiver
of
a
telephone
and
the
voice
of
the
spirit
was
heard
through
the
transmitter
as
in
an
ordinary
telephone
conversation
it
was
only
natural
after
the
scoffing
remark
that
i
had
made
that
i
should
begin
with
my
nor
can
i
ever
forget
the
peculiar
thrill
that
went
through
me
when
i
was
informed
by
the
head
of
the
agency
that
a
tracer
was
being
sent
out
for
to
call
him
to
the
phone
let
me
do
him
this
justice
was
prompt
he
was
there
in
three
minutes
whatever
his
line
of
business
was
in
the
spirit
world
and
i
was
never
able
to
learn
it
he
must
have
left
it
immediately
and
hurried
to
the
telephone
whatever
later
dissatisfaction
i
may
have
had
with
let
me
state
it
fairly
and
honestly
he
is
at
least
a
punctual
man
every
time
i
called
he
came
right
away
without
delay
let
those
who
are
inclined
to
cavil
at
the
methods
of
the
spiritualists
reflect
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
secure
such
punctuality
on
anything
but
a
basis
of
absolute
honesty
in
my
first
conversation
with
i
found
myself
so
absurdly
nervous
at
the
thought
of
the
vast
gulf
of
space
and
time
across
which
we
were
speaking
that
i
perhaps
framed
my
questions
somewhat
too
crudely
how
are
you
i
asked
his
voice
came
back
to
me
as
distinctly
as
if
he
were
in
the
next
room
i
am
happy
very
happy
please
tell
everybody
that
i
am
i
said
i
will
i
ll
see
that
everybody
knows
it
where
are
you
here
he
answered
beyond
what
here
on
the
other
side
of
which
i
asked
of
the
great
vastness
he
answered
the
other
end
of
the
oh
i
see
i
said
that
s
where
you
we
were
silent
for
some
time
it
is
amazing
how
difficult
it
is
to
find
things
to
talk
about
with
one
s
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
what
sort
of
weather
have
you
been
having
there
is
no
weather
here
said
it
s
all
bright
and
beautiful
all
the
you
mean
bright
sunshine
i
said
there
is
no
sun
here
said
then
how
do
you
mean
i
began
but
at
this
moment
the
head
of
the
agency
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
to
remind
me
that
the
two
minutes
conversation
for
which
i
had
deposited
as
a
nominal
fee
five
dollars
had
expired
the
agency
was
courteous
enough
to
inform
me
that
for
five
dollars
more
would
talk
another
two
minutes
but
i
thought
it
preferable
to
stop
for
the
moment
now
i
do
not
wish
to
say
a
word
against
my
own
yet
in
the
conversations
which
followed
on
successive
days
i
found
him
how
shall
i
put
it
unsatisfactory
he
had
been
when
on
this
side
to
use
the
term
we
spiritualists
prefer
a
singularly
able
man
an
english
judge
so
at
least
i
have
always
been
given
to
understand
but
somehow
s
brain
on
the
other
side
seemed
to
have
got
badly
damaged
my
own
theory
is
that
living
always
in
the
bright
sunshine
he
had
got
sunstroke
but
i
may
wrong
him
perhaps
it
was
locomotor
ataxy
that
he
had
that
he
was
very
very
happy
where
he
was
is
beyond
all
doubt
he
said
so
at
every
conversation
but
i
have
noticed
that
people
are
often
happy
he
said
too
that
he
was
glad
to
be
where
he
was
and
on
the
whole
i
felt
glad
that
he
was
too
once
or
twice
i
thought
that
possibly
felt
so
happy
because
he
had
been
drinking
his
voice
even
across
the
great
gulf
seemed
somehow
to
suggest
it
but
on
being
questioned
he
told
me
that
where
he
was
there
was
no
drink
and
no
thirst
because
it
was
all
so
bright
and
beautiful
i
asked
him
if
he
meant
that
it
was
like
kansas
or
whether
the
rich
could
still
get
it
but
he
didn
t
answer
our
intercourse
ended
in
a
quarrel
no
doubt
it
was
my
fault
but
it
seem
to
me
that
who
had
been
one
of
the
greatest
english
lawyers
of
his
day
might
have
handed
out
an
opinion
the
matter
came
up
thus
i
had
had
an
argument
it
was
in
the
middle
of
last
winter
with
some
men
at
my
club
about
the
legal
interpretation
of
the
adamson
law
the
dispute
grew
bitter
i
m
right
i
said
and
i
ll
prove
it
if
you
give
me
time
to
consult
the
consult
your
sneered
one
of
the
men
all
right
i
said
i
i
walked
straight
across
the
room
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
agency
give
me
my
i
said
i
want
him
right
he
was
there
good
punctual
old
soul
i
ll
say
that
for
him
he
was
there
i
said
i
m
in
a
discussion
here
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
adamson
law
involving
the
power
of
congress
under
the
constitution
now
you
remember
the
constitution
when
they
made
it
is
the
law
all
right
there
was
silence
how
does
it
stand
i
said
will
it
hold
water
then
he
spoke
over
here
he
said
there
are
no
laws
no
members
of
congress
and
no
adamsons
it
s
all
bright
and
beautiful
and
i
said
as
i
hung
up
the
receiver
in
disgust
you
are
a
mutt
i
never
spoke
to
him
again
yet
i
feel
sorry
for
him
feeble
old
soul
flitting
about
in
the
illimitable
and
always
so
punctual
to
hurry
to
the
telephone
so
happy
so
and
courteous
a
better
man
perhaps
take
it
all
in
all
than
he
was
in
life
lonely
too
it
may
be
out
there
in
the
vastness
yet
i
never
called
him
up
again
he
is
happy
let
him
stay
indeed
my
acquaintance
with
the
spirit
world
might
have
ended
at
that
point
but
for
the
good
offices
once
more
of
my
friend
you
find
your
a
little
slow
a
little
dull
he
said
well
then
if
you
want
brains
power
energy
why
not
call
up
some
of
the
spirits
of
the
great
men
some
of
the
leading
men
for
instance
of
your
s
time
you
ve
said
it
i
exclaimed
i
ll
call
up
napoleon
i
hurried
to
the
agency
is
it
possible
i
asked
for
me
to
call
up
the
emperor
napoleon
and
talk
to
him
possible
certainly
it
appeared
that
nothing
was
easier
in
the
case
of
napoleon
bonaparte
the
nominal
fee
had
to
be
ten
dollars
in
place
of
five
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
cost
five
napoleon
bonaparte
at
ten
was
cheapness
itself
will
it
take
long
to
get
him
i
asked
anxiously
we
ll
send
out
a
tracer
for
him
right
away
they
said
like
napoleon
was
punctual
that
i
will
say
for
him
if
in
any
way
i
think
less
of
napoleon
bonaparte
now
than
i
did
let
me
at
least
admit
that
a
more
punctual
obliging
willing
man
i
never
talked
with
he
came
in
two
minutes
he
s
on
the
line
now
they
said
i
took
up
the
receiver
trembling
hello
i
called
que
c
est
l
empereur
napoleon
a
qui
j
ai
l
honneur
de
parler
how
s
that
said
napoleon
je
demande
si
je
suis
en
communication
avec
l
empereur
napoleon
oh
said
napoleon
that
s
all
right
speak
what
i
said
in
surprise
you
know
english
i
always
thought
you
couldn
t
speak
a
word
of
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
he
said
i
picked
it
up
over
here
it
s
all
right
go
right
well
i
continued
i
ve
always
admired
you
so
much
your
wonderful
brain
and
genius
that
i
felt
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
and
ask
you
how
you
happy
said
napoleon
very
that
s
good
i
said
that
s
fine
and
how
is
it
out
there
all
bright
and
beautiful
eh
very
beautiful
said
the
emperor
and
just
where
are
you
i
continued
somewhere
out
in
the
unspeakable
i
suppose
eh
yes
he
answered
out
here
that
s
good
i
said
pretty
happy
eh
very
happy
said
napoleon
tell
everybody
how
happy
i
i
know
i
answered
i
ll
tell
them
all
but
just
now
i
ve
a
particular
thing
to
ask
we
ve
got
a
big
war
on
pretty
well
the
whole
world
in
it
and
i
thought
perhaps
a
few
pointers
from
a
man
like
you
but
at
this
point
the
attendant
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
your
time
is
up
he
said
i
was
about
to
offer
to
pay
at
once
for
two
minutes
more
when
a
better
idea
struck
me
talk
with
napoleon
i
d
do
better
than
that
i
d
call
a
whole
war
council
of
great
spirits
lay
the
war
crisis
before
them
and
get
the
biggest
brains
that
the
world
ever
produced
to
work
on
how
to
win
the
war
who
should
i
have
let
me
see
napoleon
himself
of
course
i
d
bring
him
back
and
for
the
sea
business
the
submarine
problem
i
d
have
nelson
george
washington
naturally
for
the
american
end
for
politics
say
good
old
ben
franklin
the
wisest
old
head
that
ever
walked
on
american
legs
and
witty
too
yes
franklin
certainly
if
only
for
his
wit
to
keep
the
council
from
getting
gloomy
lincoln
honest
old
abe
him
certainly
i
must
have
those
and
perhaps
a
few
others
i
reckoned
that
a
consultation
at
ten
dollars
apiece
with
spirits
of
that
class
was
cheap
to
the
verge
of
the
ludicrous
their
advice
ought
to
be
worth
millions
yes
billions
to
the
cause
the
agency
got
them
for
me
without
trouble
there
is
no
doubt
they
are
a
punctual
crowd
over
there
beyond
in
the
unthinkable
i
gathered
them
all
in
and
talked
to
them
all
and
severally
the
payment
a
merely
nominal
matter
being
made
in
advance
i
have
in
front
of
me
in
my
rough
notes
the
result
of
their
advice
when
properly
drafted
it
will
be
i
feel
sure
one
of
the
most
important
state
documents
produced
in
the
war
in
the
personal
sense
i
have
to
admit
it
i
found
them
just
a
trifle
disappointing
franklin
poor
fellow
has
apparently
lost
his
wit
the
spirit
of
lincoln
seemed
to
me
to
have
none
of
that
homely
wisdom
that
he
used
to
have
and
it
appears
that
we
were
quite
mistaken
in
thinking
disraeli
a
brilliant
man
it
is
clear
to
me
now
that
he
was
dull
just
about
as
dull
as
i
should
say
washington
too
is
not
at
all
the
kind
of
man
we
thought
him
still
these
are
only
personal
impressions
they
detract
nothing
from
the
extraordinary
value
of
the
advice
given
which
seems
to
me
to
settle
once
and
for
ever
any
lingering
doubt
about
the
value
of
communications
with
the
other
side
my
draft
of
their
advice
runs
in
part
as
follows
the
spirit
of
nelson
on
being
questioned
on
the
submarine
problem
holds
that
if
all
the
men
on
the
submarines
were
where
he
is
everything
would
be
bright
and
happy
this
seems
to
me
an
invaluable
hint
there
is
nothing
needed
now
except
to
put
them
there
the
advice
of
the
spirit
of
napoleon
about
the
campaign
on
land
seemed
to
me
if
possible
of
lower
value
than
that
of
nelson
on
the
campaign
at
sea
it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
napoleon
has
forgotten
where
the
marne
is
but
it
may
have
changed
since
his
day
at
any
rate
he
says
that
if
ever
the
russians
cross
the
marne
all
is
over
coming
from
such
a
this
ought
to
be
attended
to
franklin
on
being
asked
whether
the
united
states
had
done
right
in
going
into
the
war
said
yes
asked
whether
the
country
could
with
honour
have
stayed
out
he
said
there
is
guidance
here
for
thinking
men
of
all
ranks
lincoln
is
very
happy
where
he
is
so
too
i
was
amazed
to
find
is
disraeli
in
fact
it
was
most
gratifying
to
learn
that
all
of
the
great
spirits
consulted
are
very
happy
and
want
everybody
to
know
how
happy
they
are
where
they
are
i
may
say
it
is
all
bright
and
beautiful
fear
of
trespassing
on
their
time
prevented
me
from
questioning
each
of
them
up
to
the
full
limit
of
the
period
contracted
for
i
understand
that
i
have
still
to
my
credit
at
the
agency
five
minutes
talk
with
napoleon
available
at
any
time
and
similarly
five
minutes
each
with
franklin
and
washington
to
say
nothing
of
ten
minutes
unexpired
time
with
all
of
these
opportunities
i
am
willing
to
dispose
of
at
a
reduced
rate
to
anyone
still
sceptical
of
the
reality
of
the
spirit
world
the
sorrows
of
a
summer
guest
let
me
admit
as
i
start
to
write
that
the
whole
thing
is
my
own
fault
i
should
never
have
come
i
knew
better
i
have
known
better
for
years
i
have
known
that
it
is
sheer
madness
to
go
and
pay
visits
in
other
people
s
houses
yet
in
a
moment
of
insanity
i
have
let
myself
in
for
it
and
here
i
am
there
is
no
hope
no
outlet
now
till
the
first
of
september
when
my
visit
is
to
terminate
either
that
or
death
i
do
not
greatly
care
which
i
write
this
where
no
human
eye
can
see
me
down
by
the
pond
they
call
it
the
lake
at
the
foot
of
s
estate
it
is
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
no
one
is
up
for
a
brief
hour
or
so
there
is
peace
but
presently
miss
larkspur
the
jolly
english
girl
who
arrived
last
week
will
throw
open
her
casement
window
and
call
across
the
lawn
hullo
everybody
what
a
ripping
morning
and
young
poppleson
will
call
back
in
a
swiss
yodel
from
somewhere
in
the
shrubbery
and
will
appear
on
the
piazza
with
big
towels
round
his
neck
and
shout
who
s
coming
for
an
early
dip
and
so
the
day
s
fun
and
jollity
heaven
help
me
will
begin
again
presently
they
will
all
come
trooping
in
to
breakfast
in
coloured
blazers
and
fancy
blouses
laughing
and
grabbing
at
the
food
with
mimic
rudeness
and
bursts
of
hilarity
and
to
think
that
i
might
have
been
breakfasting
at
my
club
with
the
morning
paper
propped
against
the
in
a
silent
room
in
the
quiet
of
the
city
i
repeat
that
it
is
my
own
fault
that
i
am
here
for
many
years
it
had
been
a
principle
of
my
life
to
visit
nobody
i
had
long
since
learned
that
visiting
only
brings
misery
if
i
got
a
card
or
telegram
that
said
won
t
you
run
up
to
the
adirondacks
and
spend
the
with
us
i
sent
back
word
no
not
unless
the
adirondacks
can
run
faster
than
i
can
or
words
to
that
effect
if
the
owner
of
a
country
house
wrote
to
me
our
man
will
meet
you
with
a
trap
any
afternoon
that
you
care
to
name
i
answered
in
spirit
at
least
no
he
won
t
not
unless
he
has
a
or
one
of
those
traps
in
which
they
catch
wild
if
any
fashionable
lady
friend
wrote
to
me
in
the
peculiar
jargon
that
they
use
can
you
give
us
from
july
the
twelfth
at
till
the
fourteenth
at
four
i
replied
madam
take
the
whole
month
take
a
year
but
leave
me
in
such
at
least
was
the
spirit
of
my
answers
to
invitations
in
practice
i
used
to
find
it
sufficient
to
send
a
telegram
that
read
crushed
with
work
impossible
to
get
away
and
then
stroll
back
into
the
of
the
club
and
fall
asleep
again
but
my
coming
here
was
my
own
fault
it
resulted
from
one
of
those
unhappy
moments
of
expansiveness
such
as
occur
i
imagine
to
everybody
moments
when
one
appears
to
be
something
quite
different
from
what
one
really
is
when
one
feels
oneself
a
thorough
good
fellow
sociable
merry
appreciative
and
finds
the
people
around
one
the
same
such
moods
are
known
to
all
of
us
some
people
say
that
it
is
the
asserting
itself
others
say
it
is
from
drinking
but
let
it
pass
that
at
any
rate
was
the
kind
of
mood
that
i
was
in
when
i
met
and
when
he
asked
me
here
it
was
in
the
afternoon
at
the
club
as
i
recall
it
we
were
drinking
cocktails
and
i
was
thinking
what
a
bright
genial
fellow
was
and
how
completely
i
had
mistaken
him
for
myself
i
admit
it
i
am
a
brighter
better
man
after
drinking
two
cocktails
than
at
any
other
time
quicker
kindlier
more
genial
and
higher
morally
i
had
been
telling
stories
in
that
inimitable
way
that
one
has
after
two
cocktails
in
reality
i
only
know
four
stories
and
a
fifth
that
i
don
t
quite
remember
but
in
moments
of
expansiveness
they
feel
like
a
fund
or
flow
it
was
under
such
circumstances
that
i
sat
with
and
it
was
in
shaking
hands
at
leaving
that
he
said
i
wish
old
chap
that
you
could
run
up
to
our
summer
place
and
give
us
the
whole
of
august
and
i
answered
as
i
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
my
fellow
i
d
simply
to
by
gad
then
it
s
a
go
he
said
you
must
come
up
for
august
and
wake
us
all
up
wake
them
up
ye
gods
me
wake
them
up
one
hour
later
i
was
repenting
of
my
folly
and
wishing
when
i
thought
of
the
two
cocktails
that
the
prohibition
wave
could
be
hurried
up
so
as
to
leave
us
all
high
and
dry
silent
and
unsociable
then
i
clung
to
the
hope
that
would
forget
but
no
in
due
time
his
wife
wrote
to
me
they
were
looking
forward
so
much
she
said
to
my
visit
they
felt
she
repeated
her
husband
s
ominous
phrase
that
i
should
wake
them
all
up
what
sort
of
did
they
take
me
for
anyway
ah
well
they
know
better
now
it
was
only
yesterday
afternoon
that
found
me
standing
here
in
the
gloom
of
some
beside
the
edge
of
the
pond
and
took
me
back
so
quietly
to
the
house
that
i
realized
he
thought
i
meant
to
drown
myself
so
i
did
i
could
have
stood
it
better
my
coming
here
i
mean
if
they
hadn
t
come
down
to
the
station
in
a
body
to
meet
me
in
one
of
those
long
vehicles
with
seats
down
the
sides
men
in
coloured
blazers
and
girls
with
no
hats
all
making
a
hullabaloo
of
welcome
we
are
quite
a
small
party
had
written
small
great
heavens
what
would
they
call
a
large
one
and
even
those
at
the
station
turned
out
to
be
only
half
of
them
there
were
just
as
many
more
all
lined
up
on
the
piazza
of
the
house
as
we
drove
up
all
waving
a
fool
welcome
with
tennis
rackets
and
golf
clubs
small
party
indeed
why
after
six
days
there
are
still
some
of
the
idiots
whose
names
i
haven
t
got
straight
that
fool
with
the
fluffy
moustache
which
is
he
and
that
jackass
that
made
the
salad
at
the
picnic
yesterday
is
he
the
brother
of
the
woman
with
the
guitar
or
who
but
what
i
mean
is
there
is
something
in
that
sort
of
noisy
welcome
that
puts
me
to
the
bad
at
the
start
it
always
does
a
group
of
strangers
all
laughing
together
and
with
a
set
of
catchwords
and
jokes
all
their
own
always
throws
me
into
a
fit
of
sadness
deeper
than
words
i
had
thought
when
said
a
party
she
really
meant
small
i
had
had
a
mental
picture
of
a
few
sad
people
greeting
me
very
quietly
and
gently
and
of
myself
quiet
too
but
cheerful
somehow
lifting
them
up
with
no
great
effort
by
my
mere
presence
somehow
from
the
very
first
i
could
feel
that
was
disappointed
in
me
he
said
nothing
but
i
knew
it
on
that
first
afternoon
between
my
arrival
and
dinner
he
took
me
about
his
place
to
show
it
to
me
i
wish
that
at
some
proper
time
i
had
learned
just
what
it
is
that
you
say
when
a
man
shows
you
about
his
place
i
never
knew
before
how
deficient
i
am
in
it
i
am
all
right
to
be
shown
an
plant
or
a
factory
or
anything
really
wonderful
but
being
shown
a
house
and
grounds
and
trees
things
that
i
have
seen
all
my
life
leaves
me
absolutely
silent
these
big
gates
said
we
only
put
up
this
oh
i
said
that
was
all
why
shouldn
t
they
put
them
up
this
year
i
didn
t
care
if
they
d
put
them
up
this
year
or
a
thousand
years
ago
we
had
quite
a
struggle
he
continued
before
we
finally
decided
on
sandstone
you
did
eh
i
said
there
seemed
nothing
more
to
say
i
didn
t
know
what
sort
of
struggle
he
meant
or
who
fought
who
and
personally
sandstone
or
soapstone
or
any
other
stone
is
all
the
same
to
me
this
lawn
said
we
laid
down
the
first
year
we
were
i
answered
nothing
he
looked
me
right
in
the
face
as
he
said
it
and
i
looked
straight
back
at
him
but
i
saw
no
reason
to
challenge
his
statement
the
geraniums
along
the
border
he
went
on
are
rather
an
experiment
they
re
i
looked
fixedly
at
the
geraniums
but
never
said
a
word
they
were
dutch
all
right
why
not
they
were
an
experiment
very
good
let
them
be
so
i
know
nothing
in
particular
to
say
about
a
dutch
experiment
i
could
feel
that
grew
depressed
as
he
showed
me
round
i
was
sorry
for
him
but
unable
to
help
i
realized
that
there
were
certain
sections
of
my
education
that
had
been
neglected
how
to
be
shown
things
and
make
appropriate
comments
seems
to
be
an
art
in
itself
i
don
t
possess
it
it
is
not
likely
now
as
i
look
at
this
pond
that
i
ever
shall
yet
how
simple
a
thing
it
seems
when
done
by
others
i
saw
the
difference
at
once
the
very
next
day
the
second
day
of
my
visit
when
took
round
young
poppleton
the
man
that
i
mentioned
above
who
will
presently
give
a
swiss
yodel
from
a
clump
of
laurel
bushes
to
indicate
that
the
day
s
fun
has
begun
poppleton
i
had
known
before
slightly
i
used
to
see
him
at
the
club
in
club
surroundings
he
always
struck
me
as
an
ineffable
young
ass
loud
and
talkative
and
perpetually
breaking
the
silence
rules
yet
i
have
to
admit
that
in
his
summer
flannels
and
with
a
straw
hat
on
he
can
do
things
that
i
can
t
these
big
gates
began
as
he
showed
poppleton
round
the
place
with
me
trailing
beside
them
we
only
put
up
this
poppleton
who
has
a
summer
place
of
his
own
looked
at
the
gates
very
critically
now
do
you
know
what
have
done
with
those
gates
if
they
were
mine
he
said
no
said
i
d
have
set
them
two
feet
wider
apart
they
re
too
narrow
old
chap
too
poppleton
shook
his
head
sadly
at
the
gates
we
had
quite
a
struggle
said
before
we
finally
decided
on
i
realized
that
he
had
one
and
the
same
line
of
talk
that
he
always
used
i
resented
it
no
wonder
it
was
easy
for
him
great
mistake
said
poppleton
too
soft
look
at
this
here
he
picked
up
a
big
stone
and
began
pounding
at
the
see
how
easily
it
chips
smashes
right
off
look
at
that
the
whole
corner
knocks
right
off
see
entered
no
protest
i
began
to
see
that
there
is
a
sort
of
understanding
a
kind
of
freemasonry
among
men
who
have
summer
places
one
shows
his
things
the
other
runs
them
down
and
smashes
them
this
makes
the
whole
thing
easy
at
once
showed
his
lawn
your
turf
is
all
wrong
old
boy
said
poppleton
look
it
has
no
body
to
it
see
i
can
kick
holes
in
it
with
my
heel
look
at
that
and
that
if
i
had
on
stronger
boots
i
could
kick
this
lawn
all
to
these
geraniums
along
the
border
said
are
rather
an
experiment
they
re
but
my
dear
fellow
said
poppleton
you
ve
got
them
set
in
wrongly
they
ought
to
slope
the
sun
you
know
never
it
wait
a
bit
here
he
picked
up
a
spade
that
was
lying
where
a
gardener
had
been
working
i
ll
throw
a
few
out
notice
how
easily
they
come
up
ah
that
fellow
broke
they
re
apt
to
there
i
won
t
bother
to
reset
them
but
tell
your
man
to
slope
them
over
from
the
sun
that
s
the
showed
his
new
next
and
poppleton
knocked
a
hole
in
the
side
with
a
hammer
to
show
that
the
lumber
was
too
thin
if
that
were
he
said
i
d
rip
the
outside
clean
off
it
and
use
shingle
and
it
was
i
noticed
poppleton
s
plan
first
to
imagine
s
things
his
own
and
then
to
smash
them
and
then
give
them
back
smashed
to
this
seemed
to
please
them
both
apparently
it
is
a
method
of
entertaining
a
guest
and
being
entertained
and
poppleton
after
an
hour
or
so
of
it
were
delighted
with
one
another
yet
somehow
when
i
tried
it
myself
it
failed
to
work
do
you
know
what
i
would
do
with
that
cedar
if
it
was
mine
i
asked
my
host
the
next
day
no
he
said
i
d
knock
the
thing
down
and
burn
it
i
answered
but
i
think
i
must
have
said
it
too
fiercely
looked
hurt
and
said
nothing
not
that
these
people
are
not
doing
all
they
can
for
me
i
know
that
i
admit
it
if
i
meet
my
end
here
and
if
to
put
the
thing
straight
out
lifeless
body
is
found
floating
on
the
surface
of
this
pond
i
should
like
there
to
be
documentary
evidence
of
much
they
are
trying
their
best
this
is
liberty
hall
said
to
me
on
the
first
day
of
my
visit
we
want
you
to
feel
that
you
are
to
do
absolutely
as
you
like
absolutely
as
i
like
how
little
they
know
me
i
should
like
to
have
answered
madam
i
have
now
reached
a
time
of
life
when
human
society
at
breakfast
is
impossible
to
me
when
any
conversation
prior
to
eleven
must
be
considered
out
of
the
question
when
i
prefer
to
eat
my
meals
in
quiet
or
with
such
mild
hilarity
as
can
be
got
from
a
comic
paper
when
i
can
no
longer
wear
nankeen
pants
and
a
coloured
blazer
without
a
sense
of
personal
indignity
when
i
can
no
longer
leap
and
play
in
the
water
like
a
young
fish
when
i
do
not
yodel
can
not
sing
and
to
my
regret
dance
even
worse
than
i
did
when
young
and
when
the
mood
of
mirth
and
hilarity
comes
to
me
only
as
a
rare
visitant
shall
we
say
at
a
burlesque
performance
and
never
as
a
daily
part
of
my
existence
madam
i
am
unfit
to
be
a
summer
guest
if
this
is
liberty
hall
indeed
let
me
oh
let
me
go
such
is
the
speech
that
i
would
make
if
it
were
possible
as
it
is
i
can
only
rehearse
it
to
myself
indeed
the
more
i
analyse
it
the
more
impossible
it
seems
for
a
man
of
my
temperament
at
any
rate
to
be
a
summer
guest
these
people
and
i
imagine
all
other
summer
people
seem
to
be
trying
to
live
in
a
perpetual
joke
everything
all
day
has
to
be
taken
in
a
mood
of
uproarious
fun
however
i
can
speak
of
it
all
now
in
quiet
retrospect
and
without
bitterness
it
will
soon
be
over
now
indeed
the
reason
why
i
have
come
down
at
this
early
hour
to
this
quiet
water
is
that
things
have
reached
a
crisis
the
situation
has
become
extreme
and
i
must
end
it
it
happened
last
night
took
me
aside
while
the
others
were
dancing
the
to
the
victrola
on
the
piazza
we
re
planning
to
have
some
rather
good
fun
night
he
said
something
that
will
be
a
good
deal
more
in
your
line
than
a
lot
of
it
i
m
afraid
has
been
up
here
in
fact
my
wife
says
that
this
will
be
the
very
thing
for
oh
i
said
we
re
going
to
get
all
the
people
from
the
other
houses
over
and
the
girls
this
term
uses
to
mean
his
wife
and
her
friends
are
going
to
get
up
a
sort
of
entertainment
with
charades
and
things
all
impromptu
more
or
less
of
course
oh
i
said
i
saw
already
what
was
coming
and
they
want
you
to
act
as
a
sort
of
to
make
up
the
gags
and
introduce
the
different
stunts
and
all
that
i
was
telling
the
girls
about
that
afternoon
at
the
club
when
you
were
simply
killing
us
all
with
those
funny
stories
of
yours
and
they
re
all
wild
over
wild
i
repeated
yes
quite
wild
over
it
they
say
it
will
be
the
hit
of
the
shook
hands
with
great
warmth
as
we
parted
for
the
night
i
knew
that
he
was
thinking
that
my
character
was
about
to
be
triumphantly
vindicated
and
that
he
was
glad
for
my
sake
last
night
i
did
not
sleep
i
remained
awake
all
night
thinking
of
the
in
my
whole
life
i
have
done
nothing
in
public
except
once
when
i
presented
a
to
the
of
our
club
on
the
occasion
of
his
taking
a
trip
to
europe
even
for
that
i
used
to
rehearse
to
myself
far
into
the
night
sentences
that
began
this
gentleman
means
far
more
than
a
mere
and
now
they
expect
me
to
come
out
as
a
merry
before
an
assembled
crowd
of
summer
guests
but
never
mind
it
is
nearly
over
now
i
have
come
down
to
this
quiet
water
in
the
early
morning
to
throw
myself
in
they
will
find
me
floating
here
among
the
lilies
some
few
will
understand
i
can
see
it
written
as
it
will
be
in
the
newspapers
what
makes
the
sad
fatality
doubly
poignant
is
that
the
unhappy
victim
had
just
entered
upon
a
holiday
visit
that
was
to
have
been
prolonged
throughout
the
whole
month
needless
to
say
he
was
regarded
as
the
life
and
soul
of
the
pleasant
party
of
holiday
makers
that
had
gathered
at
the
delightful
country
home
of
and
indeed
on
the
very
day
of
the
tragedy
he
was
to
have
taken
a
leading
part
in
staging
a
merry
performance
of
charades
and
parlour
entertainments
a
thing
for
which
his
genial
talents
and
overflowing
high
spirits
rendered
him
specially
when
they
read
that
those
who
know
me
best
will
understand
how
and
why
i
died
he
had
still
over
three
weeks
to
stay
there
they
will
say
he
was
to
act
as
the
stage
manager
of
they
will
shake
their
heads
they
will
understand
but
what
is
this
i
raise
my
eyes
from
the
paper
and
i
see
hurriedly
approaching
from
the
house
he
is
hastily
dressed
with
flannel
trousers
and
a
his
face
looks
grave
something
has
happened
thank
god
something
has
happened
some
accident
some
tragedy
something
to
prevent
the
charades
i
write
these
few
lines
on
a
fast
train
that
is
carrying
me
back
to
new
york
a
cool
comfortable
train
with
a
deserted
where
i
can
sit
in
a
leather
with
my
feet
up
on
another
smoking
silent
and
at
peace
villages
farms
and
summer
places
are
flying
by
let
them
fly
i
too
am
flying
back
to
the
rest
and
quiet
of
the
city
old
man
said
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
mine
very
kindly
he
is
a
decent
fellow
after
all
is
jones
they
re
calling
you
by
from
new
what
is
it
i
asked
or
tried
to
gasp
it
s
bad
news
old
chap
fire
in
your
office
last
evening
i
m
afraid
a
lot
of
your
private
papers
were
burned
robinson
that
s
your
senior
clerk
isn
t
it
seems
to
have
been
on
the
spot
trying
to
save
things
he
s
badly
singed
about
the
face
and
hands
i
m
afraid
you
must
go
at
yes
yes
i
said
at
i
know
i
ve
told
the
man
to
get
the
trap
ready
right
away
you
ve
just
time
to
catch
the
come
right
i
said
i
kept
my
face
as
well
as
i
could
trying
to
hide
my
exultation
the
office
burnt
fine
robinson
s
singed
glorious
i
hurriedly
packed
my
things
and
whispered
to
farewell
messages
for
the
sleeping
household
i
never
felt
so
jolly
and
facetious
in
my
life
i
could
feel
that
was
admiring
the
spirit
and
pluck
with
which
i
took
my
misfortune
later
on
he
would
tell
them
all
about
it
the
trap
ready
hurrah
old
man
hurrah
all
right
i
ll
telegraph
right
you
are
hip
hip
hurrah
here
we
are
train
right
on
time
just
these
two
bags
porter
and
there
s
a
dollar
for
you
what
merry
merry
fellows
these
darky
porters
are
anyway
and
so
here
i
am
in
the
train
safe
bound
for
home
and
the
summer
quiet
of
my
club
well
done
for
robinson
i
was
afraid
that
it
had
missed
fire
or
that
my
message
to
him
had
gone
wrong
it
was
on
the
second
day
of
my
visit
that
i
sent
word
to
him
to
invent
an
accident
something
anything
to
call
me
back
i
thought
the
message
had
failed
i
had
lost
hope
but
it
is
all
right
now
though
he
certainly
pitched
the
note
pretty
high
of
course
i
can
t
let
the
know
that
it
was
a
job
i
must
set
fire
to
the
office
as
soon
as
i
get
back
but
it
s
worth
it
and
i
ll
have
to
singe
robinson
about
the
face
and
hands
but
it
s
worth
that
too
vi
to
nature
and
back
again
it
was
probably
owing
to
the
fact
that
my
place
of
lodgment
in
new
york
overlooked
the
waving
trees
of
central
park
that
i
was
consumed
all
the
summer
through
with
a
great
longing
for
the
woods
to
me
as
a
lover
of
nature
the
waving
of
a
tree
conveys
thoughts
which
are
never
conveyed
to
me
except
by
seeing
a
tree
wave
this
longing
grew
upon
me
i
became
restless
with
it
in
the
daytime
i
dreamed
over
my
work
at
night
my
sleep
was
broken
and
restless
at
times
i
would
even
wander
forth
at
night
into
the
park
and
there
deep
in
the
night
shadow
of
the
trees
imagine
myself
alone
in
the
recesses
of
the
dark
woods
remote
from
the
toil
and
fret
of
our
distracted
civilization
this
increasing
feeling
culminated
in
the
resolve
which
becomes
the
subject
of
this
narrative
the
thought
came
to
me
suddenly
one
night
i
woke
from
my
sleep
with
a
plan
fully
matured
in
my
mind
it
was
this
i
would
for
one
month
cast
off
all
the
travail
and
cares
of
civilized
life
and
become
again
the
wild
man
of
the
woods
that
nature
made
me
m
woods
somewhere
in
new
england
divest
myself
of
my
clothes
except
only
my
union
suit
crawl
into
the
woods
stay
there
a
month
and
then
crawl
out
again
to
a
trained
woodsman
and
crawler
like
myself
the
thing
was
simplicity
itself
for
food
i
knew
that
i
could
rely
on
berries
roots
shoots
mosses
mushrooms
fungi
bungi
in
fact
the
whole
of
nature
s
ample
storehouse
for
my
drink
the
running
brook
and
the
quiet
pool
and
for
my
companions
the
twittering
chipmunk
the
chickadee
the
chocktaw
the
the
and
the
hundred
and
one
inhabitants
of
the
forgotten
glade
and
the
tangled
thicket
fortunately
for
me
my
resolve
came
to
me
upon
the
last
day
in
august
the
month
of
september
was
my
vacation
my
time
was
my
own
i
was
free
to
go
on
my
rising
in
the
morning
my
preparations
were
soon
made
or
rather
there
were
practically
no
preparations
to
make
i
had
but
to
supply
myself
with
a
camera
my
one
necessity
in
the
woods
and
to
say
to
my
friends
even
this
last
ordeal
i
wished
to
make
as
brief
as
possible
i
had
no
wish
to
arouse
their
anxiety
over
the
dangerous
perhaps
foolhardy
project
that
i
had
in
mind
i
wished
as
far
as
possible
to
say
in
such
a
way
as
to
allay
the
very
natural
fears
which
my
undertaking
would
excite
in
the
minds
of
my
friends
from
myself
although
trained
in
the
craft
of
the
woods
i
could
not
conceal
the
danger
that
i
incurred
yet
the
danger
was
almost
forgotten
in
the
extraordinary
and
novel
interest
that
attached
to
the
experiment
would
it
prove
possible
for
a
man
unaided
by
our
civilized
arts
and
industries
to
maintain
himself
naked
except
for
his
union
suit
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
could
he
do
it
or
could
he
not
and
if
he
couldn
t
what
then
but
this
last
thought
i
put
from
me
time
alone
could
answer
the
question
as
in
duty
bound
i
went
first
to
the
place
of
business
where
i
am
employed
to
shake
hands
and
say
to
my
employer
i
am
going
i
said
to
spend
a
month
naked
alone
in
the
he
looked
up
from
his
desk
with
genial
kindliness
that
s
right
he
said
get
a
good
my
plan
is
i
added
to
live
on
berries
and
fine
he
answered
well
have
a
good
time
old
man
then
i
dropped
in
casually
upon
one
of
my
friends
well
i
said
i
m
off
to
new
england
to
spend
a
month
nantucket
he
said
or
newport
no
i
answered
speaking
as
lightly
as
i
could
i
m
going
into
the
woods
and
stay
there
naked
for
a
oh
yes
he
said
i
see
well
old
chap
see
you
when
you
get
after
that
i
called
upon
two
or
three
other
men
to
say
a
brief
word
of
farewell
i
could
not
help
feeling
slightly
nettled
i
must
confess
at
the
very
casual
way
in
which
they
seemed
to
take
my
announcement
oh
yes
they
said
naked
in
the
woods
eh
well
till
you
get
here
was
a
man
about
to
risk
his
life
for
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
in
a
great
sociological
experiment
yet
they
received
the
announcement
with
absolute
unconcern
it
offered
one
more
assurance
had
i
needed
it
of
the
degenerate
state
of
the
civilization
upon
which
i
was
turning
my
back
on
my
way
to
the
train
i
happened
to
run
into
a
newspaper
reporter
with
whom
i
have
some
acquaintance
i
m
just
off
i
said
to
new
england
to
spend
a
month
naked
at
least
naked
all
but
my
union
suit
in
the
woods
no
doubt
you
ll
like
a
few
details
about
it
for
your
thanks
old
man
he
said
we
ve
pretty
well
given
up
running
that
nature
stuff
we
couldn
t
do
anything
with
it
unless
of
course
anything
happens
to
you
then
we
d
be
glad
to
give
you
some
several
of
my
friends
had
at
least
the
decency
to
see
me
off
on
the
train
one
and
one
alone
accompanied
me
on
the
long
to
new
england
in
order
that
he
might
bring
back
my
clothes
my
watch
and
other
possessions
from
the
point
where
i
should
enter
the
woods
together
with
such
few
messages
of
farewell
as
i
might
scribble
at
the
last
moment
it
was
early
morning
when
we
arrived
at
the
wayside
station
where
we
were
to
alight
from
here
we
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
arrived
at
this
point
we
halted
i
took
off
my
clothes
with
the
exception
of
my
union
suit
then
taking
a
pot
of
brown
stain
from
my
valise
i
proceeded
to
dye
my
face
and
hands
and
my
union
suit
itself
a
deep
butternut
brown
what
s
that
for
asked
my
friend
for
protection
i
answered
don
t
you
know
that
all
animals
are
protected
by
their
peculiar
markings
that
render
them
invisible
the
caterpillar
looks
like
the
leaf
it
eats
from
the
scales
of
the
fish
counterfeit
the
glistening
water
of
the
brook
the
bear
and
the
possum
are
coloured
like
the
on
which
they
climb
there
i
added
as
i
concluded
my
task
i
am
now
gee
said
my
friend
i
handed
him
back
the
valise
and
the
empty
dropped
to
my
hands
and
knees
my
camera
slung
about
my
neck
and
proceeded
to
crawl
into
the
bush
my
friend
stood
watching
me
why
don
t
you
stand
up
and
walk
i
heard
him
call
i
turned
half
round
and
growled
at
him
then
i
plunged
deeper
into
the
bush
growling
as
i
went
after
ten
minutes
active
crawling
i
found
myself
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
it
reached
all
about
me
on
every
side
for
hundreds
of
miles
all
around
me
was
the
unbroken
stillness
of
the
woods
not
a
sound
reached
my
ear
save
the
twittering
of
a
squirrel
or
squirl
in
the
branches
high
above
my
head
or
the
call
of
a
loon
hovering
over
some
woodland
lake
i
judged
that
i
had
reached
a
spot
suitable
for
my
habitation
my
first
care
was
to
make
a
fire
difficult
though
it
might
appear
to
the
degenerate
dweller
of
the
city
to
do
this
to
the
trained
woodsman
such
as
i
had
now
become
it
is
nothing
i
selected
a
dry
stick
rubbed
it
vigorously
against
my
hind
leg
and
in
a
few
moments
it
broke
into
a
generous
blaze
half
an
hour
later
i
was
sitting
beside
a
glowing
fire
of
twigs
discussing
with
great
gusto
an
appetizing
mess
of
boiled
grass
and
fungi
cooked
in
a
hollow
stone
i
ate
my
fill
not
pausing
till
i
was
full
careless
as
the
natural
man
ever
is
of
the
morrow
then
stretched
out
upon
the
at
the
foot
of
a
great
tree
i
lay
in
drowsy
contentment
listening
to
the
song
of
the
birds
the
hum
of
the
myriad
insects
and
the
strident
note
of
the
squirrel
high
above
me
at
times
i
would
give
utterance
to
the
soft
answering
call
known
to
every
woodsman
that
is
part
of
the
freemasonry
of
animal
speech
as
i
lay
thus
i
would
not
have
exchanged
places
with
the
pale
dweller
in
the
city
for
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
here
i
lay
remote
from
the
world
happy
full
of
grass
listening
to
the
crooning
of
the
birds
but
the
mood
of
inaction
and
reflection
can
not
last
even
with
the
lover
of
nature
it
was
time
to
be
up
and
doing
much
lay
before
me
to
be
done
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
should
bring
with
it
as
i
fully
expected
it
would
darkness
before
night
fell
i
must
build
a
house
make
myself
a
suit
of
clothes
lay
in
a
store
of
nuts
and
in
short
prepare
myself
for
the
oncoming
of
winter
which
in
the
bush
may
come
on
at
any
time
in
the
summer
i
rose
briskly
from
the
ground
to
my
hands
and
knees
and
set
myself
to
the
building
of
my
house
the
method
that
i
intended
to
follow
here
was
merely
that
which
nature
has
long
since
taught
to
the
beaver
and
which
moreover
is
known
and
practised
by
the
gauchos
of
the
pampas
by
the
googoos
of
rhodesia
and
by
many
other
tribes
i
had
but
to
select
a
suitable
growth
of
trees
and
gnaw
them
down
with
my
teeth
taking
care
so
to
gnaw
them
that
each
should
fall
into
the
place
appointed
for
it
in
the
building
the
sides
once
erected
in
this
fashion
another
row
of
trees
properly
situated
is
gnawed
down
to
fall
crosswise
as
the
roof
i
set
myself
briskly
to
work
and
in
half
an
hour
had
already
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
my
habitation
rising
into
shape
i
was
still
gnawing
with
unabated
energy
when
i
was
interrupted
by
a
low
growling
in
the
underbrush
with
animal
caution
i
shrank
behind
a
tree
growling
in
return
i
could
see
something
moving
in
the
bushes
evidently
an
animal
of
large
size
from
its
snarl
i
judged
it
to
be
a
bear
i
could
hear
it
moving
nearer
to
me
it
was
about
to
attack
me
a
savage
joy
thrilled
through
me
at
the
thought
while
my
union
suit
bristled
with
rage
from
head
to
foot
as
i
emitted
growl
after
growl
of
defiance
i
bared
my
teeth
to
the
gums
snarling
and
lashed
my
flank
with
my
hind
foot
eagerly
i
watched
for
the
onrush
of
the
bear
in
savage
combat
who
strikes
first
wins
it
was
my
idea
as
soon
as
the
bear
should
appear
to
bite
off
its
front
legs
one
after
the
other
this
initial
advantage
once
gained
i
had
no
doubt
of
ultimate
victory
the
brushes
parted
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
long
brown
body
and
a
hairy
head
then
the
creature
reared
up
breasting
itself
against
a
log
full
in
front
of
me
great
heavens
it
was
not
a
bear
at
all
it
was
a
man
he
was
dressed
as
i
was
in
a
union
suit
and
his
face
and
hands
like
mine
were
stained
a
butternut
brown
his
hair
was
long
and
matted
and
two
weeks
stubble
of
beard
was
on
his
face
for
a
minute
we
both
glared
at
one
another
still
growling
then
the
man
rose
up
to
a
standing
position
with
a
muttered
exclamation
of
disgust
ah
cut
it
out
he
said
let
s
talk
he
walked
over
towards
me
and
sat
down
upon
a
log
in
an
attitude
that
seemed
to
convey
the
same
disgust
as
the
expression
of
his
features
then
he
looked
round
about
him
what
are
you
doing
he
said
building
a
house
i
answered
i
know
he
said
with
a
nod
what
are
you
here
for
why
i
explained
my
plan
is
this
i
want
to
see
whether
a
man
can
come
out
here
in
the
woods
naked
with
no
aid
but
that
of
his
own
hands
and
his
own
ingenuity
and
yes
yes
i
know
interrupted
the
disconsolate
man
earn
himself
a
livelihood
in
the
wilderness
live
as
the
lived
carefree
and
far
from
the
curse
of
civilization
that
s
it
that
was
my
idea
i
said
my
enthusiasm
rekindling
as
i
spoke
that
s
what
i
m
doing
my
food
is
to
be
the
rude
grass
and
the
roots
that
nature
furnishes
for
her
children
and
for
my
drink
yes
yes
he
interrupted
again
with
impatience
for
your
drink
the
running
rill
for
your
bed
the
sweet
couch
of
hemlock
and
for
your
canopy
the
open
sky
lit
with
the
soft
stars
in
the
vault
of
the
dewy
night
i
great
heavens
man
i
exclaimed
that
s
my
idea
exactly
in
fact
those
are
my
very
phrases
how
could
you
have
guessed
it
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
to
indicate
weariness
and
disillusionment
pshaw
he
said
i
know
it
because
i
ve
been
doing
it
i
ve
been
here
a
fortnight
now
on
this
game
well
i
m
sick
of
it
this
last
lets
me
what
last
i
asked
why
meeting
you
do
you
realize
that
you
are
the
nineteenth
man
that
i
ve
met
in
the
last
three
days
running
about
naked
in
the
woods
they
re
all
doing
it
the
woods
are
full
of
you
don
t
say
so
i
gasped
fact
wherever
you
go
in
the
bush
you
find
naked
men
all
working
out
this
same
blasted
old
experiment
why
when
you
get
a
little
farther
in
you
ll
see
signs
up
naked
men
not
allowed
in
this
bush
and
naked
men
keep
off
and
gentlemen
who
are
naked
will
kindly
keep
to
the
high
road
and
a
lot
of
things
like
that
you
must
have
come
in
at
a
wrong
place
or
you
d
have
noticed
the
little
shanties
that
they
have
now
at
the
edge
of
the
new
england
bush
with
signs
up
union
suits
bought
and
sold
cameras
for
sale
or
to
rent
highest
price
for
clothing
and
all
that
sort
of
no
i
said
i
saw
well
you
look
when
you
go
back
as
for
me
i
m
done
with
it
the
thing
s
worked
out
i
m
going
back
to
the
city
to
see
whether
i
can
t
right
there
in
the
heart
of
the
city
earn
myself
a
livelihood
with
my
unaided
hands
and
brains
that
s
the
real
problem
no
more
bumming
on
the
animals
for
me
this
bush
business
is
too
easy
well
i
m
but
stop
a
minute
i
said
how
is
it
that
if
what
you
say
is
true
i
haven
t
seen
or
heard
anybody
in
the
bush
and
i
ve
been
here
since
the
middle
of
the
morning
nonsense
the
man
answered
they
were
probably
all
round
you
but
you
didn
t
recognize
no
no
it
s
not
possible
i
lay
here
dreaming
beneath
a
tree
and
there
wasn
t
a
sound
except
the
twittering
of
a
squirrel
and
far
away
the
cry
of
a
nothing
exactly
the
twittering
of
a
squirrel
that
was
some
feller
up
the
tree
twittering
to
beat
the
band
to
let
on
that
he
was
a
squirrel
and
no
doubt
some
other
feller
calling
out
like
a
loon
over
near
the
lake
i
suppose
you
gave
them
the
answering
cry
i
did
i
said
i
gave
that
low
guttural
note
which
precisely
which
is
the
universal
greeting
in
the
freemasonry
of
animal
speech
i
see
you
ve
got
it
all
down
pat
well
again
i
m
off
oh
don
t
bother
to
growl
please
i
m
sick
of
that
line
of
i
said
he
slid
through
the
bushes
and
disappeared
i
sat
where
i
was
musing
my
work
interrupted
a
mood
of
bitter
disillusionment
heavy
upon
me
so
i
sat
it
may
have
been
for
hours
in
the
far
distance
i
could
hear
the
faint
cry
of
a
bittern
in
some
lonely
marsh
now
who
the
deuce
is
making
that
noise
i
muttered
some
silly
fool
i
suppose
trying
to
think
he
s
a
waterfowl
cut
it
out
long
i
lay
my
dream
of
the
woods
shattered
wondering
what
to
do
then
suddenly
there
came
to
my
ear
the
loud
sound
of
voices
human
voices
strident
and
eager
with
nothing
of
the
animal
growl
in
them
he
s
in
there
i
seen
him
i
heard
some
one
call
rapidly
i
dived
sideways
into
the
underbrush
my
animal
instinct
strong
upon
me
again
growling
as
i
went
instinctively
i
knew
that
it
was
i
that
they
were
after
all
the
animal
joy
of
being
hunted
came
over
me
my
union
suit
stood
up
on
end
with
mingled
fear
and
rage
as
fast
as
i
could
i
retreated
into
the
wood
yet
somehow
as
i
moved
the
wood
instead
of
growing
denser
seemed
to
thin
out
i
crouched
low
still
growling
and
endeavouring
to
bury
myself
in
the
thicket
i
was
filled
with
a
wild
sense
of
exhilaration
such
as
any
lover
of
the
wild
life
would
feel
at
the
knowledge
that
he
is
being
chased
that
some
one
is
after
him
that
some
one
is
perhaps
just
a
few
feet
behind
him
waiting
to
stick
a
pitchfork
into
him
as
he
runs
there
is
no
ecstasy
like
this
then
i
realized
that
my
pursuers
had
closed
in
on
me
i
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
the
woods
had
somehow
grown
thin
they
were
like
the
mere
shrubbery
of
a
park
it
might
be
of
central
park
itself
i
could
hear
among
the
deeper
tones
of
men
the
shrill
voices
of
boys
there
he
is
one
cried
going
through
them
bushes
look
at
him
humping
himself
what
is
it
what
s
the
sport
another
called
some
crazy
guy
loose
in
the
park
in
his
underclothes
and
the
cops
after
then
they
closed
in
on
me
i
recognized
the
blue
suits
of
the
police
force
and
their
short
clubs
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
dragged
out
of
the
shrubbery
and
stood
in
the
open
park
in
my
pyjamas
wide
awake
shivering
in
the
chilly
air
of
early
morning
fortunately
for
me
it
was
decided
at
the
that
is
not
an
offence
against
the
law
i
was
dismissed
with
a
caution
my
vacation
is
still
before
me
and
i
still
propose
to
spend
it
naked
but
i
shall
do
so
at
atlantic
city
vii
the
as
he
is
i
think
it
likely
that
few
people
besides
myself
have
ever
actually
seen
and
spoken
with
a
yet
everybody
nowadays
knows
all
about
the
the
magazines
and
the
new
fiction
have
made
him
a
familiar
figure
a
few
years
ago
it
is
true
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
him
but
lately
for
some
reason
or
other
there
has
been
a
run
on
the
no
story
is
complete
without
one
or
two
references
to
him
the
hero
when
the
heroine
slights
him
is
said
to
feel
for
a
moment
the
wild
primordial
desire
of
the
the
longing
to
seize
her
to
drag
her
with
him
to
carry
her
away
to
make
her
when
he
takes
her
in
his
arms
it
is
recorded
that
all
the
elemental
passion
of
the
surges
through
when
he
fights
on
her
behalf
against
a
or
a
or
an
or
any
other
compound
that
makes
up
a
modern
villain
he
is
said
to
feel
all
the
fierce
fighting
joy
of
the
if
they
kick
him
in
the
ribs
he
likes
it
if
they
beat
him
over
the
head
he
never
feels
it
because
he
is
for
the
moment
a
and
the
is
and
is
known
to
be
quite
above
sensation
the
heroine
too
shares
the
same
point
of
view
take
me
she
murmurs
as
she
falls
into
the
hero
s
embrace
be
my
as
she
says
it
there
is
so
the
writer
assures
us
something
of
the
fierce
light
of
the
in
her
eyes
the
primordial
woman
to
be
wooed
and
won
only
by
force
so
like
everybody
else
i
had
till
i
saw
him
a
great
idea
of
the
i
had
a
clear
mental
picture
of
him
huge
brawny
muscular
a
wolfskin
thrown
about
him
and
a
great
in
his
hand
i
knew
him
as
without
fear
with
nerves
untouched
by
our
effete
civilization
fighting
as
the
beasts
fight
to
the
death
killing
without
pity
and
suffering
without
a
moan
it
was
a
picture
that
i
could
not
but
admire
i
liked
too
i
am
free
to
confess
it
his
peculiar
way
with
women
his
system
was
as
i
understood
it
to
take
them
by
the
neck
and
bring
them
along
with
him
that
was
his
fierce
primordial
way
of
wooing
them
and
they
liked
it
so
at
least
we
are
informed
by
a
thousand
credible
authorities
they
liked
it
and
the
modern
woman
so
we
are
told
would
still
like
it
if
only
one
dared
to
try
it
on
there
s
the
trouble
if
one
only
i
see
lots
of
them
i
ll
be
frank
about
it
that
i
should
like
to
grab
to
sling
over
my
shoulder
and
carry
away
with
me
or
what
is
the
same
thing
allowing
for
modern
conditions
have
an
express
man
carry
them
i
notice
them
at
atlantic
city
i
see
them
in
fifth
avenue
yes
everywhere
but
would
they
come
that
s
the
of
it
would
they
come
right
along
like
the
merely
biting
off
my
ear
as
they
came
or
are
they
degenerate
enough
to
bring
an
action
against
me
indicting
the
express
company
as
a
party
of
the
second
part
doubts
such
as
these
prevent
me
from
taking
active
measures
but
they
leave
me
as
they
leave
many
another
man
preoccupied
and
fascinated
with
the
one
may
imagine
then
my
extraordinary
interest
in
him
when
i
actually
met
him
in
the
flesh
yet
the
thing
came
about
quite
simply
indeed
more
by
accident
than
by
design
an
adventure
open
to
all
it
so
happened
that
i
spent
my
vacation
in
kentucky
the
region
as
everybody
knows
of
the
great
caves
they
extend
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
for
hundreds
of
miles
in
some
places
dark
and
sunless
tunnels
the
black
silence
broken
only
by
the
dripping
of
the
water
from
the
roof
in
other
places
great
vaults
like
subterranean
temples
with
vast
stone
arches
sweeping
to
the
dome
and
with
deep
still
water
of
unfathomed
depth
as
the
floor
and
here
and
there
again
they
are
lighted
from
above
through
rifts
in
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
are
dry
and
sand
strewn
fit
for
human
habitation
in
such
caves
as
these
so
has
the
obstinate
legend
run
for
centuries
there
still
dwell
the
dwindling
remnant
of
their
race
and
here
it
was
that
i
came
across
him
i
had
penetrated
into
the
caves
far
beyond
my
guides
i
carried
a
revolver
and
had
with
me
an
electric
lantern
but
the
increasing
sunlight
in
the
cave
as
i
went
on
had
rendered
the
latter
needless
there
he
sat
a
huge
figure
clad
in
a
great
wolfskin
besides
him
lay
a
great
club
across
his
knee
was
a
spear
round
which
he
was
binding
sinews
that
tightened
under
his
muscular
hand
his
head
was
bent
over
his
task
his
matted
hair
had
fallen
over
his
eyes
he
did
not
see
me
till
i
was
close
beside
him
on
the
sanded
floor
of
the
cave
i
gave
a
slight
cough
excuse
me
i
said
the
gave
a
startled
jump
my
goodness
he
said
you
startled
me
i
could
see
that
he
was
quite
trembling
you
came
along
so
suddenly
he
said
it
gave
me
the
then
he
muttered
more
to
himself
than
to
me
too
much
of
this
darned
i
must
quit
drinking
i
sat
down
near
to
the
caveman
on
a
stone
taking
care
to
place
my
revolver
carefully
behind
it
i
don
t
mind
admitting
that
a
loaded
revolver
especially
as
i
get
older
makes
me
nervous
i
was
afraid
that
he
might
start
fooling
with
it
one
can
t
be
too
careful
as
a
way
of
opening
conversation
i
picked
up
the
s
club
say
i
said
that
s
a
great
club
you
have
eh
by
gee
it
s
heavy
look
out
said
the
with
a
certain
agitation
in
his
voice
as
he
reached
out
and
took
the
club
from
me
don
t
fool
with
that
club
it
s
loaded
you
know
you
could
easily
drop
the
club
on
your
toes
or
on
mine
a
man
can
t
be
too
careful
with
a
loaded
he
rose
as
he
said
this
and
carried
the
club
to
the
other
side
of
the
cave
where
he
leant
it
against
the
wall
now
that
he
stood
up
and
i
could
examine
him
he
no
longer
looked
so
big
in
fact
he
was
not
big
at
all
the
effect
of
size
must
have
come
i
think
from
the
great
wolfskin
that
he
wore
i
have
noticed
the
same
thing
in
grand
opera
i
noticed
too
for
the
first
time
that
the
cave
we
were
in
seemed
fitted
up
in
a
rude
sort
of
way
like
a
this
is
a
nice
place
you
ve
got
i
said
dandy
isn
t
it
he
said
as
he
cast
his
eyes
around
fixed
it
up
she
s
got
great
taste
see
that
mud
sideboard
that
s
the
real
thing
mud
none
of
your
cheap
rock
about
that
we
fetched
that
mud
for
two
miles
to
make
that
and
look
at
that
wicker
bucket
isn
t
it
great
hardly
leaks
at
all
except
through
the
sides
and
perhaps
a
little
through
the
bottom
wove
that
she
s
a
humdinger
at
he
was
moving
about
as
he
spoke
showing
me
all
his
little
belongings
he
reminded
me
for
all
the
world
of
a
man
in
a
harlem
flat
showing
a
visitor
how
convenient
it
all
is
somehow
too
the
had
lost
all
appearance
of
size
he
looked
in
fact
quite
little
and
when
he
had
pushed
his
long
hair
back
from
his
forehead
he
seemed
to
wear
that
same
worried
apologetic
look
that
we
all
have
to
a
higher
being
if
there
is
such
our
little
faces
one
and
all
appear
no
doubt
pathetic
i
knew
that
he
must
be
speaking
about
his
wife
where
is
she
i
asked
my
wife
he
said
oh
she
s
gone
out
somewhere
through
the
caves
with
the
kid
you
didn
t
meet
our
kid
as
you
came
along
did
you
no
well
he
s
the
greatest
boy
you
even
saw
he
was
only
two
this
nineteenth
of
august
and
you
should
hear
him
say
pop
and
mom
just
as
if
he
was
grown
up
he
is
really
i
think
about
the
brightest
boy
i
ve
ever
known
i
mean
quite
apart
from
being
his
father
and
speaking
of
him
as
if
he
were
anyone
else
s
boy
you
didn
t
meet
them
no
i
said
i
didn
oh
well
the
went
on
there
are
lots
of
ways
and
passages
through
i
guess
they
went
in
another
direction
the
wife
generally
likes
to
take
a
stroll
round
in
the
morning
and
see
some
of
the
neighbours
but
say
he
interrupted
i
guess
i
m
forgetting
my
manners
let
me
get
you
a
drink
of
here
take
it
in
this
stone
mug
there
you
are
say
when
where
do
we
get
it
oh
we
find
it
in
parts
of
the
cave
where
it
filters
through
the
soil
above
alcoholic
oh
yes
about
fifteen
per
cent
i
think
some
say
it
soaks
all
through
the
soil
of
this
state
sit
down
and
be
comfortable
and
say
if
you
hear
the
woman
coming
just
slip
your
mug
behind
that
stone
out
of
sight
do
you
mind
now
try
one
of
these
cigars
oh
pick
a
good
one
there
are
lots
of
them
we
seated
ourselves
in
some
comfort
on
the
soft
sand
our
backs
against
the
boulders
sipping
and
smoking
cigars
it
seemed
altogether
as
if
one
were
back
in
civilization
talking
to
a
genial
host
yes
said
the
and
he
spoke
as
it
were
in
a
large
and
patronizing
way
i
generally
let
my
wife
trot
about
as
she
likes
in
the
daytime
she
and
the
other
women
nowadays
are
getting
up
all
these
different
movements
and
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
that
if
it
amuses
her
to
run
around
and
talk
and
attend
meetings
why
let
her
do
it
of
course
he
continued
assuming
a
look
of
great
firmness
if
i
liked
to
put
my
foot
down
exactly
exactly
i
said
it
s
the
same
way
with
us
is
it
now
he
questioned
with
interest
i
had
imagined
that
it
was
all
different
outside
you
re
from
the
outside
aren
t
you
i
guessed
you
must
be
from
the
skins
you
have
you
never
been
outside
i
asked
no
fear
said
the
not
for
mine
down
here
in
the
caves
clean
underground
and
mostly
in
the
dark
it
s
all
right
it
s
nice
and
he
gave
a
sort
of
shudder
gee
you
fellows
out
there
must
have
your
nerve
to
go
walking
around
like
that
on
the
outside
rim
of
everything
where
the
stars
might
fall
on
you
or
a
thousand
things
happen
to
you
but
then
you
outside
men
have
got
a
natural
elemental
fearlessness
about
you
that
we
have
lost
i
tell
you
i
was
pretty
scared
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
you
standing
had
you
never
seen
any
outside
men
i
asked
why
yes
he
answered
but
never
close
the
most
i
ve
done
is
to
go
out
to
the
edges
of
the
cave
sometimes
and
look
out
and
see
them
outside
men
and
women
in
the
distance
but
of
course
in
one
way
or
another
we
know
all
about
them
and
the
thing
we
envy
most
in
you
outside
men
is
the
way
you
treat
your
women
by
gee
you
take
no
nonsense
from
them
you
fellows
are
the
real
primordial
primitive
men
we
ve
lost
it
why
my
dear
fellow
i
began
but
the
who
had
sat
suddenly
upright
interrupted
quick
quick
he
said
hide
that
infernal
mug
she
s
coming
don
t
you
hear
as
he
spoke
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
somewhere
in
the
outer
passages
of
the
cave
now
willie
she
was
saying
speaking
evidently
to
the
you
come
right
along
back
with
me
and
if
i
ever
catch
you
getting
in
such
a
mess
as
that
again
i
ll
never
take
you
anywhere
so
there
her
voice
had
grown
louder
she
entered
the
cave
as
she
spoke
a
woman
in
a
suit
of
skins
leading
by
the
hand
a
pathetic
little
mite
in
a
with
blue
eyes
and
a
slobbered
face
but
as
i
was
sitting
the
evidently
couldn
t
see
me
for
she
turned
at
once
to
speak
to
her
husband
unconscious
of
my
presence
well
of
all
the
idle
creatures
she
exclaimed
loafing
here
in
the
sand
she
gave
a
sniff
and
smoking
my
dear
began
the
don
t
you
me
she
answered
look
at
this
place
nothing
tidied
up
yet
and
the
day
half
through
did
you
put
the
alligator
on
to
boil
i
was
just
going
to
say
began
the
to
say
yes
i
don
t
doubt
you
were
going
to
say
you
d
go
on
saying
all
day
if
i
d
let
you
what
i
m
asking
you
is
is
the
alligator
on
to
boil
for
dinner
or
is
it
not
my
gracious
she
broke
off
all
of
a
sudden
as
she
caught
sight
of
me
why
didn
t
you
say
there
was
company
land
sakes
and
you
sit
there
and
never
say
there
was
a
gentleman
here
she
had
hustled
across
the
cave
and
was
busily
arranging
her
hair
with
a
pool
of
water
as
a
mirror
gracious
she
said
i
m
a
perfect
fright
you
must
excuse
me
she
added
looking
round
toward
me
for
being
in
this
state
i
d
just
slipped
on
this
old
fur
blouse
and
run
around
to
a
neighbour
s
and
i
d
no
idea
that
he
was
going
to
bring
in
company
just
like
him
i
m
afraid
we
ve
nothing
but
a
plain
alligator
stew
to
offer
you
but
i
m
sure
if
you
ll
stay
to
dinner
she
was
hustling
about
already
good
primitive
housewife
that
she
was
making
the
rattle
on
the
mud
table
why
really
i
began
but
i
was
interrupted
by
a
sudden
exclamation
from
both
the
and
the
together
willie
where
s
willie
gracious
cried
the
woman
he
s
wandered
out
alone
oh
hurry
look
for
him
something
might
get
him
he
may
have
fallen
in
the
water
oh
hurry
they
were
off
in
a
moment
shouting
into
the
dark
passages
of
the
outer
cave
willie
willie
there
was
agonized
anxiety
in
their
voices
and
then
in
a
moment
as
it
seemed
they
were
back
again
with
willie
in
their
arms
blubbering
his
all
wet
goodness
gracious
said
the
he
d
fallen
right
in
the
poor
little
man
hurry
dear
and
get
something
dry
to
wrap
him
in
goodness
what
a
fright
quick
darling
give
me
something
to
rub
him
anxiously
the
moved
about
beside
the
child
all
quarrel
vanished
but
surely
i
said
as
they
calmed
down
a
little
just
there
where
willie
fell
in
beside
the
passage
that
i
came
through
there
is
only
three
inches
of
so
there
is
they
said
both
together
but
just
suppose
it
had
been
three
feet
later
on
when
willie
was
restored
they
both
renewed
their
invitation
to
me
to
stay
to
dinner
didn
t
you
say
said
the
that
you
wanted
to
make
some
notes
on
the
difference
between
and
the
people
of
your
world
of
i
thank
you
i
answered
i
have
already
all
the
notes
i
want
viii
ideal
interviews
i
with
a
european
prince
with
any
european
prince
travelling
in
america
on
receiving
our
card
the
prince
to
our
great
surprise
and
pleasure
sent
down
a
most
cordial
message
that
he
would
be
delighted
to
see
us
at
once
this
thrilled
us
take
us
we
said
to
the
elevator
boy
to
the
apartments
of
the
we
were
pleased
to
see
him
stagger
and
lean
against
his
wheel
to
get
his
breath
back
in
a
few
moments
we
found
ourselves
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
prince
s
apartments
the
prince
who
is
a
charming
young
man
of
from
to
came
across
the
floor
to
meet
us
with
an
extended
hand
and
a
simple
gesture
of
welcome
we
have
seldom
seen
anyone
come
across
the
floor
more
simply
the
prince
who
is
travelling
incognito
as
the
count
of
flim
flam
was
wearing
when
we
saw
him
the
plain
morning
dress
of
a
gentleman
of
leisure
we
learned
that
a
little
earlier
he
had
appeared
at
breakfast
in
the
costume
of
a
unitarian
clergyman
under
the
incognito
of
the
bishop
of
bongee
while
later
on
he
appeared
at
lunch
as
a
delicate
compliment
to
our
city
in
the
costume
of
a
columbia
professor
of
yiddish
the
prince
greeted
us
with
the
greatest
cordiality
seated
himself
without
the
slightest
affectation
and
motioned
to
us
with
indescribable
bonhomie
his
permission
to
remain
standing
well
said
the
prince
what
is
it
we
need
hardly
say
that
the
prince
who
is
a
consummate
master
of
ten
languages
speaks
english
quite
as
fluently
as
he
does
chinese
indeed
for
a
moment
we
could
scarcely
tell
which
he
was
talking
what
are
your
impressions
of
the
united
states
we
asked
as
we
took
out
our
notebook
i
am
afraid
answered
the
prince
with
the
delightful
smile
which
is
characteristic
of
him
and
which
we
noticed
again
and
again
during
the
interview
that
i
must
scarcely
tell
you
we
realized
immediately
that
we
were
in
the
presence
not
only
of
a
soldier
but
of
one
of
the
most
consummate
diplomats
of
the
present
day
may
we
ask
then
we
resumed
correcting
our
obvious
blunder
what
are
your
impressions
prince
of
the
atlantic
ocean
ah
said
the
prince
with
that
peculiar
thoughtfulness
which
is
so
noticeable
in
him
and
which
we
observed
not
once
but
several
times
the
atlantic
volumes
could
not
have
expressed
his
thought
better
did
you
we
asked
see
any
ice
during
your
passage
across
ah
said
the
prince
ice
let
me
we
did
so
ice
repeated
the
prince
thoughtfully
we
realized
that
we
were
in
the
presence
not
only
of
a
soldier
a
linguist
and
a
diplomat
but
of
a
trained
scientist
accustomed
to
exact
research
ice
repeated
the
prince
did
i
see
any
ice
nothing
could
have
been
more
decisive
more
final
than
the
clear
simple
brevity
of
the
prince
s
he
had
seen
no
ice
he
knew
he
had
seen
no
ice
he
said
he
had
seen
no
ice
nothing
could
have
been
more
straightforward
more
direct
we
felt
assured
from
that
moment
that
the
prince
had
not
seen
any
ice
the
exquisite
good
taste
with
which
the
prince
had
answered
our
question
served
to
put
us
entirely
at
our
ease
and
we
presently
found
ourselves
chatting
with
his
highness
with
the
greatest
freedom
and
without
the
slightest
or
or
in
fact
of
any
kind
we
realized
indeed
that
we
were
in
the
presence
not
only
of
a
trained
soldier
a
linguist
and
a
diplomat
but
also
of
a
conversationalist
of
the
highest
order
his
highness
who
has
an
exquisite
sense
of
humour
indeed
it
broke
out
again
and
again
during
our
talk
with
him
expressed
himself
as
both
amused
and
perplexed
over
our
american
money
it
is
very
difficult
he
said
with
us
it
is
so
simple
six
and
a
half
groner
are
equal
to
one
and
a
third
or
the
quarter
part
of
our
rigsdaler
here
it
is
so
we
ventured
to
show
the
prince
a
piece
and
to
explain
its
value
by
putting
two
quarters
beside
it
i
see
said
the
prince
whose
mathematical
ability
is
quite
exceptional
two
pieces
are
equal
to
one
piece
i
must
try
to
remember
that
meantime
he
added
with
a
gesture
of
royal
condescension
putting
the
money
in
his
pocket
i
will
keep
your
coins
as
instructors
we
murmured
our
thanks
and
now
explain
to
me
please
your
gold
piece
and
your
we
felt
it
proper
however
to
shift
the
subject
and
asked
the
prince
a
few
questions
in
regard
to
his
views
on
american
politics
we
soon
found
that
his
highness
although
this
is
his
first
visit
to
this
continent
is
a
keen
student
of
our
institutions
and
our
political
life
indeed
his
altitude
showed
by
his
answers
to
our
questions
that
he
is
as
well
informed
about
our
politics
as
we
are
ourselves
on
being
asked
what
he
viewed
as
the
uppermost
tendency
in
our
political
life
of
the
prince
replied
thoughtfully
that
he
didn
t
know
to
our
inquiry
as
to
whether
in
his
opinion
democracy
was
moving
forward
or
backward
the
prince
after
a
moment
of
reflection
answered
that
he
had
no
idea
on
our
asking
which
of
the
generals
of
our
civil
war
was
regarded
in
europe
as
the
greatest
strategist
his
highness
answered
without
hesitation
george
before
closing
our
interview
the
prince
who
like
his
illustrious
father
is
an
enthusiastic
sportsman
completely
turned
the
tables
on
us
by
inquiring
eagerly
about
the
prospects
for
large
game
in
america
we
told
him
something
as
much
as
we
could
recollect
of
woodchuck
hunting
in
our
own
section
of
the
country
the
prince
was
interested
at
once
his
eye
lighted
up
and
the
peculiar
air
of
fatigue
or
languor
which
we
had
thought
to
remark
on
his
face
during
our
interview
passed
entirely
off
his
features
he
asked
us
a
number
of
questions
quickly
and
without
pausing
with
the
air
in
fact
of
a
man
accustomed
to
command
and
not
to
listen
how
was
the
woodchuck
hunted
from
horseback
or
from
an
elephant
or
from
an
armoured
car
or
turret
how
many
beaters
did
one
use
to
beat
up
the
woodchuck
what
bearers
was
it
necessary
to
carry
with
one
how
great
a
danger
must
one
face
of
having
one
s
beaters
killed
what
percentage
of
risk
must
one
be
prepared
to
incur
of
accidentally
shooting
one
s
own
beaters
what
did
a
bearer
cost
and
so
on
all
these
questions
we
answered
as
best
we
could
the
prince
apparently
seizing
the
gist
or
essential
part
of
our
answer
before
we
had
said
it
in
concluding
the
discussion
we
ventured
to
ask
his
highness
for
his
autograph
the
prince
who
has
perhaps
a
more
exquisite
sense
of
humour
than
any
other
sovereign
of
europe
declared
with
a
laugh
that
he
had
no
pen
still
roaring
over
this
inimitable
drollery
we
begged
the
prince
to
honour
us
by
using
our
own
is
there
any
ink
in
it
asked
the
prince
which
threw
us
into
a
renewed
paroxysm
of
laughter
the
prince
took
the
pen
and
very
kindly
autographed
for
us
seven
photographs
of
himself
he
offered
us
more
but
we
felt
that
seven
was
about
all
we
could
use
we
were
still
suffocated
with
laughter
over
the
prince
s
wit
his
highness
was
still
signing
photographs
when
an
equerry
appeared
and
whispered
in
the
prince
s
ear
his
highness
with
the
consummate
tact
to
be
learned
only
at
a
court
turned
quietly
without
a
word
and
left
the
room
we
never
in
all
our
experience
remember
seeing
a
prince
or
a
mere
man
for
the
matter
of
that
leave
a
room
with
greater
suavity
discretion
or
aplomb
it
was
a
revelation
of
breeding
of
race
of
long
slavery
to
caste
and
yet
with
it
all
it
seemed
to
have
a
touch
of
finality
about
it
a
hint
that
the
entire
proceeding
was
deliberate
planned
not
to
be
altered
by
circumstance
he
did
not
come
back
we
understand
that
he
appeared
later
in
the
morning
at
a
civic
reception
in
the
costume
of
an
alpine
jaeger
and
attended
the
matinee
in
the
dress
of
a
lieutenant
of
police
meantime
he
has
our
pen
if
he
turns
up
in
any
costume
that
we
can
spot
at
sight
we
shall
ask
him
for
it
ii
with
our
greatest
actor
that
is
to
say
with
any
one
of
our
sixteen
greatest
actors
it
was
within
the
privacy
of
his
own
library
that
we
obtained
need
we
say
with
infinite
difficulty
our
interview
with
the
great
actor
he
was
sitting
in
a
deep
so
buried
in
his
own
thoughts
that
he
was
oblivious
of
our
approach
on
his
knee
before
him
lay
a
cabinet
photograph
of
himself
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
peering
into
it
as
if
seeking
to
fathom
its
unfathomable
mystery
we
had
time
to
note
that
a
beautiful
carbon
photogravure
of
himself
stood
on
a
table
at
his
elbow
while
a
magnificent
pastel
of
himself
was
suspended
on
a
string
from
the
ceiling
it
was
only
when
we
had
seated
ourself
in
a
chair
and
taken
out
our
notebook
that
the
great
actor
looked
up
an
interview
he
said
and
we
noted
with
pain
the
weariness
in
his
tone
another
interview
we
bowed
publicity
he
murmured
rather
to
himself
than
to
us
publicity
why
must
one
always
be
forced
into
publicity
it
was
not
our
intention
we
explained
apologetically
to
publish
or
to
print
a
single
word
eh
what
exclaimed
the
great
actor
not
print
it
not
publish
it
then
what
in
not
we
explained
without
his
consent
ah
he
murmured
wearily
my
consent
yes
yes
i
must
give
it
the
world
demands
it
print
publish
anything
you
like
i
am
indifferent
to
praise
careless
of
fame
posterity
will
judge
me
but
he
added
more
briskly
let
me
see
a
proof
of
it
in
time
to
make
any
changes
i
might
care
we
bowed
our
assent
and
now
we
began
may
we
be
permitted
to
ask
a
few
questions
about
your
art
and
first
in
which
branch
of
the
drama
do
you
consider
that
your
genius
chiefly
lies
in
tragedy
or
in
comedy
in
both
said
the
great
actor
you
excel
then
we
continued
in
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
not
at
all
he
answered
i
excel
in
each
of
excuse
us
we
said
we
haven
t
made
our
meaning
quite
clear
what
we
meant
to
say
is
stated
very
simply
that
you
do
not
consider
yourself
better
in
either
of
them
than
in
the
other
not
at
all
said
the
actor
as
he
put
out
his
arm
with
that
splendid
gesture
that
we
have
known
and
admired
for
years
at
the
same
time
throwing
back
his
leonine
head
so
that
his
leonine
hair
fell
back
from
his
leonine
forehead
not
at
all
i
do
better
in
both
of
them
my
genius
demands
both
tragedy
and
comedy
at
the
same
ah
we
said
as
a
light
broke
in
upon
us
then
that
we
presume
is
the
reason
why
you
are
about
to
appear
in
shakespeare
the
great
actor
frowned
i
would
rather
put
it
he
said
that
shakespeare
is
about
to
appear
in
of
course
of
course
we
murmured
ashamed
of
our
own
stupidity
i
appear
went
on
the
great
actor
in
i
expect
to
present
i
may
say
an
entirely
new
a
new
hamlet
we
exclaimed
fascinated
a
new
hamlet
is
such
a
thing
possible
entirely
said
the
great
actor
throwing
his
leonine
head
forward
again
i
have
devoted
years
of
study
to
the
part
the
whole
conception
of
the
part
of
hamlet
has
been
we
sat
stunned
all
actors
hitherto
continued
the
great
actor
or
rather
i
should
say
all
actors
i
mean
all
those
who
tried
to
act
before
me
have
been
entirely
mistaken
in
their
presentation
they
have
presented
hamlet
as
dressed
in
black
yes
yes
we
interjected
in
black
velvet
yes
very
good
the
thing
is
absurd
continued
the
great
actor
as
he
reached
down
two
or
three
heavy
volumes
from
the
shelf
beside
him
have
you
ever
studied
the
elizabethan
era
the
which
we
asked
modestly
the
elizabethan
era
we
were
silent
or
the
tragedy
we
hung
our
head
if
you
had
you
would
know
that
a
hamlet
in
black
velvet
is
perfectly
ridiculous
in
shakespeare
s
day
as
i
could
prove
in
a
moment
if
you
had
the
intelligence
to
understand
it
there
was
no
such
thing
as
black
velvet
it
didn
t
and
how
then
we
asked
intrigued
puzzled
and
yet
delighted
do
present
hamlet
in
velvet
said
the
great
actor
great
heavens
we
exclaimed
this
is
a
it
is
but
that
is
only
one
part
of
my
conception
the
main
thing
will
be
my
presentation
of
what
i
may
call
the
psychology
of
the
psychology
we
said
yes
resumed
the
great
actor
the
psychology
to
make
hamlet
understood
i
want
to
show
him
as
a
man
bowed
down
by
a
great
burden
he
is
overwhelmed
with
weltschmerz
he
carries
in
him
the
whole
weight
of
the
zeitgeist
in
fact
everlasting
negation
lies
on
him
you
mean
we
said
trying
to
speak
as
cheerfully
as
we
could
that
things
are
a
little
bit
too
much
for
his
will
went
on
the
great
actor
disregarding
our
interruption
is
paralysed
he
seeks
to
move
in
one
direction
and
is
hurled
in
another
one
moment
he
sinks
into
the
abyss
the
next
he
rises
above
the
clouds
his
feet
seek
the
ground
but
find
only
the
air
wonderful
we
said
but
will
you
not
need
a
good
deal
of
machinery
machinery
exclaimed
the
great
actor
with
a
leonine
laugh
the
machinery
of
the
mechanism
of
power
of
magnetism
ah
we
said
not
at
all
said
the
great
actor
you
fail
to
understand
it
is
all
done
by
my
rendering
take
for
example
the
famous
soliloquy
on
death
you
know
it
to
be
or
not
to
be
we
began
stop
said
the
great
actor
now
observe
it
is
a
soliloquy
precisely
that
is
the
key
to
it
it
is
something
that
hamlet
to
not
a
of
in
my
interpretation
is
actually
spoken
all
is
done
in
absolute
unbroken
how
on
earth
we
began
can
you
do
that
entirely
and
solely
my
good
heavens
was
it
possible
we
looked
again
this
time
very
closely
at
the
great
actor
s
face
we
realized
with
a
thrill
that
it
might
be
done
i
come
before
the
audience
he
went
on
and
soliloquize
thus
follow
my
face
please
as
the
great
actor
spoke
he
threw
himself
into
a
characteristic
pose
with
folded
arms
while
gust
after
gust
of
emotion
of
expression
of
alternate
hope
doubt
and
despair
swept
we
might
say
chased
themselves
across
his
features
wonderful
we
gasped
shakespeare
s
lines
said
the
great
actor
as
his
face
subsided
to
its
habitual
calm
are
not
necessary
not
at
least
with
my
acting
the
lines
indeed
are
mere
stage
directions
nothing
more
i
leave
them
out
this
happens
again
and
again
in
the
play
take
for
instance
the
familiar
scene
where
hamlet
holds
the
skull
in
his
hand
shakespeare
here
suggests
the
words
alas
poor
yorick
i
knew
him
well
yes
yes
we
interrupted
in
spite
of
ourself
a
fellow
of
infinite
jest
your
intonation
is
awful
said
the
actor
but
listen
in
my
interpretation
i
use
no
words
at
all
i
merely
carry
the
skull
quietly
in
my
hand
very
slowly
across
the
stage
there
i
lean
against
a
pillar
at
the
side
with
the
skull
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
and
look
at
it
in
wonderful
we
said
i
then
cross
over
to
the
right
of
the
stage
very
impressively
and
seat
myself
on
a
plain
wooden
bench
and
remain
for
some
time
looking
at
the
marvellous
i
then
pass
to
the
back
of
the
stage
and
lie
down
on
my
stomach
still
holding
the
skull
before
my
eyes
after
holding
this
posture
for
some
time
i
crawl
slowly
forward
portraying
by
the
movement
of
my
legs
and
stomach
the
whole
sad
history
of
yorick
finally
i
turn
my
back
on
the
audience
still
holding
the
skull
and
convey
through
the
spasmodic
movements
of
my
back
hamlet
s
passionate
grief
at
the
loss
of
his
why
we
exclaimed
beside
ourself
with
excitement
this
is
not
merely
a
revolution
it
is
a
call
it
both
said
the
great
actor
the
meaning
of
it
is
we
went
on
that
you
practically
don
t
need
shakespeare
at
exactly
i
do
not
i
could
do
better
without
him
shakespeare
cramps
me
what
i
really
mean
to
convey
is
not
shakespeare
but
something
greater
larger
how
shall
i
express
it
the
great
actor
paused
and
we
waited
our
pencil
poised
in
the
air
then
he
murmured
as
his
eyes
lifted
in
an
expression
of
something
like
rapture
in
fact
he
remained
thus
motionless
without
moving
we
slipped
gently
to
our
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
quietly
to
the
door
and
so
down
the
stairs
our
notebook
in
our
teeth
iii
with
our
greatest
scientist
as
seen
in
any
of
our
college
laboratories
it
was
among
the
retorts
and
of
his
physical
laboratory
that
we
were
privileged
to
interview
the
great
scientist
his
back
was
towards
us
when
we
entered
with
characteristic
modesty
he
kept
it
so
for
some
time
after
our
entry
even
when
he
turned
round
and
saw
us
his
face
did
not
react
off
us
as
we
should
have
expected
he
seemed
to
look
at
us
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
without
seeing
us
or
at
least
without
wishing
to
see
us
we
handed
him
our
card
he
took
it
read
it
dropped
it
in
a
bowlful
of
sulphuric
acid
and
then
with
a
quiet
gesture
of
satisfaction
turned
again
to
his
work
we
sat
for
some
time
behind
him
this
then
we
thought
to
ourselves
we
always
think
to
ourselves
when
we
are
left
alone
is
the
man
or
rather
is
the
back
of
the
man
who
has
done
more
here
we
consulted
the
notes
given
us
by
our
editor
to
revolutionize
our
conception
of
atomic
dynamics
than
the
back
of
any
other
presently
the
great
scientist
turned
towards
us
with
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
our
ears
to
have
a
note
of
weariness
in
it
something
we
felt
must
be
making
him
tired
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
said
professor
we
answered
we
have
called
upon
you
in
response
to
an
overwhelming
demand
on
the
part
of
the
public
the
great
scientist
nodded
to
learn
something
of
your
new
researches
and
discoveries
in
here
we
consulted
a
minute
card
which
we
carried
in
our
pocket
in
which
are
already
becoming
we
consulted
our
card
again
a
household
word
the
professor
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
check
us
i
would
rather
say
he
murmured
so
would
we
we
admitted
much
rather
after
all
said
the
great
scientist
helium
shares
in
the
most
intimate
degree
the
properties
of
radium
so
too
for
the
matter
of
that
he
added
in
afterthought
do
thorium
and
borium
even
borium
we
exclaimed
delighted
and
writing
rapidly
in
our
notebook
already
we
saw
ourselves
writing
up
as
our
headline
shares
properties
of
just
what
is
it
said
the
great
scientist
that
you
want
to
know
professor
we
answered
what
our
journal
wants
is
a
plain
and
simple
explanation
so
clear
that
even
our
readers
can
understand
it
of
the
new
scientific
discoveries
in
radium
we
understand
that
you
possess
more
than
any
other
man
the
gift
of
clear
and
lucid
thought
the
professor
nodded
and
that
you
are
able
to
express
yourself
with
greater
simplicity
than
any
two
men
now
the
professor
nodded
again
now
then
we
said
spreading
our
notes
on
our
knee
go
at
it
tell
us
and
through
us
tell
a
quarter
of
a
million
anxious
readers
just
what
all
these
new
discoveries
are
the
whole
thing
said
the
professor
warming
up
to
his
work
as
he
perceived
from
the
motions
of
our
face
and
ears
our
intelligent
interest
is
simplicity
itself
i
can
give
it
to
you
in
a
word
that
s
it
we
said
give
it
to
us
that
it
amounts
if
one
may
boil
it
down
into
a
phrase
boil
it
boil
it
we
interrupted
amounts
if
one
takes
the
mere
gist
of
it
take
it
we
said
take
amounts
to
the
resolution
of
the
ultimate
ha
we
exclaimed
i
must
ask
you
first
to
clear
your
mind
the
professor
continued
of
all
conception
of
ponderable
we
nodded
we
had
already
cleared
our
mind
of
this
in
fact
added
the
professor
with
what
we
thought
a
quiet
note
of
warning
in
his
voice
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
must
be
regarded
as
altogether
we
hastened
to
assure
the
professor
that
in
accordance
with
the
high
standards
of
honour
represented
by
our
journal
we
should
of
course
regard
anything
that
he
might
say
as
ultramicroscopic
and
treat
it
accordingly
you
say
then
we
continued
that
the
essence
of
the
problem
is
the
resolution
of
the
atom
do
you
think
you
can
give
us
any
idea
of
what
the
atom
is
the
professor
looked
at
us
searchingly
we
looked
back
at
him
openly
and
frankly
the
moment
was
critical
for
our
interview
could
he
do
it
were
we
the
kind
of
person
that
he
could
give
it
to
could
we
get
it
if
he
did
i
think
i
can
he
said
let
us
begin
with
the
assumption
that
the
atom
is
an
infinitesimal
magnitude
very
good
let
us
grant
then
that
though
it
is
imponderable
and
indivisible
it
must
have
a
spacial
content
you
grant
me
this
we
do
we
said
we
do
more
than
this
we
it
to
very
well
if
spacial
it
must
have
dimension
if
dimension
form
let
us
assume
the
form
to
be
that
of
a
spheroid
and
see
where
it
leads
the
professor
was
now
intensely
interested
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
laboratory
his
features
worked
with
excitement
we
worked
ours
too
as
sympathetically
as
we
could
there
is
no
other
possible
method
in
inductive
science
he
added
than
to
embrace
some
hypothesis
the
most
attractive
that
one
can
find
and
remain
with
it
we
nodded
even
in
our
own
humble
life
after
our
day
s
work
we
had
found
this
true
now
said
the
professor
planting
himself
squarely
in
front
of
us
assuming
a
spherical
form
and
a
spacial
content
assuming
the
dynamic
forces
that
are
familiar
to
us
and
assuming
the
thing
is
bold
i
admit
we
looked
as
bold
as
we
could
assuming
that
the
or
of
the
atom
i
know
no
better
word
neither
do
we
we
said
that
the
nuclei
move
under
the
energy
of
such
forces
what
have
we
got
ha
we
said
what
have
we
got
why
the
simplest
matter
conceivable
the
forces
inside
our
atom
itself
mind
you
the
function
of
a
circle
mark
that
we
did
becomes
merely
a
function
of
pi
the
great
scientist
paused
with
a
laugh
of
triumph
a
function
of
pi
we
repeated
in
delight
precisely
our
conception
of
ultimate
matter
is
reduced
to
that
of
an
oblate
spheroid
described
by
the
revolution
of
an
ellipse
on
its
own
minor
axis
good
heavens
we
said
merely
nothing
else
and
in
that
case
any
further
calculation
becomes
a
mere
matter
of
the
extraction
of
a
how
simple
we
murmured
is
it
not
said
the
professor
in
fact
i
am
accustomed
in
talking
to
my
class
to
give
them
a
very
clear
idea
by
simply
taking
as
our
root
f
f
being
any
finite
constant
he
looked
at
us
sharply
we
nodded
and
raising
f
to
the
log
of
infinity
i
find
they
apprehend
it
very
do
they
we
murmured
ourselves
we
felt
as
if
the
log
of
infinity
carried
us
to
ground
higher
than
what
we
commonly
care
to
tread
on
of
course
said
the
professor
the
log
of
infinity
is
an
of
course
we
said
very
gravely
we
felt
ourselves
here
in
the
presence
of
something
that
demanded
our
reverence
but
still
continued
the
professor
almost
jauntily
we
can
handle
the
unknown
just
as
easily
as
anything
this
puzzled
us
we
kept
silent
we
thought
it
wiser
to
move
on
to
more
general
ground
in
any
case
our
notes
were
now
nearly
complete
these
discoveries
then
we
said
are
absolutely
they
are
said
the
professor
you
have
now
as
we
understand
got
the
atom
how
shall
we
put
it
got
it
where
you
want
not
exactly
said
the
professor
with
a
sad
smile
what
do
you
mean
we
asked
unfortunately
our
analysis
perfect
though
it
is
stops
short
we
have
no
the
professor
spoke
as
in
deep
sorrow
no
synthesis
we
moaned
we
felt
it
was
a
cruel
blow
but
in
any
case
our
notes
were
now
elaborate
enough
we
felt
that
our
readers
could
do
without
a
synthesis
we
rose
to
go
synthetic
dynamics
said
the
professor
taking
us
by
the
coat
is
only
beginning
in
that
case
we
murmured
disengaging
his
hand
but
wait
wait
he
pleaded
wait
for
another
fifty
years
we
will
we
said
very
earnestly
but
meantime
as
our
paper
goes
to
press
this
afternoon
we
must
go
now
in
fifty
years
we
will
come
oh
i
see
i
see
said
the
professor
you
are
writing
all
this
for
a
newspaper
i
yes
we
said
we
mentioned
that
at
the
ah
said
the
professor
did
you
very
possibly
we
propose
we
said
to
feature
the
article
for
next
will
it
be
long
he
asked
about
two
columns
we
answered
and
how
much
said
the
professor
in
a
hesitating
way
do
i
have
to
pay
you
to
put
it
in
how
much
which
we
asked
how
much
do
i
have
to
pay
why
professor
we
began
quickly
then
we
checked
ourselves
after
all
was
it
right
to
undeceive
him
this
quiet
absorbed
man
of
science
with
his
ideals
his
atoms
and
his
emanations
no
a
hundred
times
no
let
him
pay
a
hundred
times
it
will
cost
you
we
said
very
firmly
ten
the
professor
began
groping
among
his
apparatus
we
knew
that
he
was
looking
for
his
purse
we
should
like
also
very
much
we
said
to
insert
your
picture
along
with
the
article
would
that
cost
much
he
asked
no
that
is
only
five
the
professor
had
meantime
found
his
purse
would
it
be
all
right
he
began
that
is
would
you
mind
if
i
pay
you
the
money
now
i
am
apt
to
quite
all
right
we
answered
we
said
very
gently
and
passed
out
we
felt
somehow
as
if
we
had
touched
a
higher
life
such
we
murmured
as
we
looked
about
the
ancient
campus
are
the
men
of
science
are
there
perhaps
any
others
of
them
round
this
morning
that
we
might
interview
iv
with
our
typical
novelists
edwin
and
ethelinda
afterthought
husband
and
wife
in
their
delightful
home
life
it
was
at
their
beautiful
country
place
on
the
woonagansett
that
we
had
the
pleasure
of
interviewing
the
afterthoughts
at
their
own
cordial
invitation
we
had
walked
over
from
the
nearest
railway
station
a
distance
of
some
fourteen
miles
indeed
as
soon
as
they
heard
of
our
intention
they
invited
us
to
walk
we
are
so
sorry
not
to
bring
you
in
the
motor
they
wrote
but
the
roads
are
so
frightfully
dusty
that
we
might
get
dust
on
our
this
little
touch
of
thoughtfulness
is
the
keynote
of
their
character
the
house
itself
is
a
delightful
old
mansion
giving
on
a
wide
garden
which
gives
in
turn
on
a
broad
terrace
giving
on
the
river
the
eminent
novelist
met
us
at
the
gate
we
had
expected
to
find
the
author
of
and
garden
of
a
pale
aesthetic
type
we
have
a
way
of
expecting
the
wrong
thing
in
our
interviews
we
could
not
resist
a
shock
of
surprise
indeed
we
seldom
do
at
finding
him
a
burly
man
weighting
as
he
himself
told
us
a
hundred
stone
in
his
stockinged
feet
we
think
he
said
stone
he
shook
hands
cordially
come
and
see
my
pigs
he
said
we
wanted
to
ask
you
we
began
as
we
went
down
the
walk
something
about
your
let
s
look
at
the
pigs
first
he
said
are
you
anything
of
a
pig
man
we
are
always
anxious
in
our
interviews
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
but
we
were
compelled
to
admit
that
we
were
not
much
of
a
pig
man
ah
said
the
great
novelist
perhaps
you
are
more
of
a
dog
man
not
altogether
a
dog
man
we
answered
anything
of
a
bee
man
he
asked
something
we
said
we
were
once
stung
by
a
bee
ah
he
said
you
shall
have
a
go
at
the
beehives
then
right
away
we
assured
him
that
we
were
willing
to
postpone
a
go
at
the
beehives
till
later
come
along
then
to
the
styes
said
the
great
novelist
and
he
added
perhaps
you
re
not
much
of
a
we
blushed
we
thought
of
the
five
little
faces
around
the
table
for
which
we
provide
food
by
writing
our
interviews
no
we
said
we
were
not
much
of
a
now
then
said
the
great
novelist
as
we
reached
our
goal
how
do
you
like
this
stye
very
much
indeed
we
said
i
ve
put
in
a
new
tile
draining
my
own
plan
you
notice
how
sweet
it
keeps
the
we
had
not
noticed
this
i
am
afraid
said
the
novelist
that
the
pigs
are
all
asleep
we
begged
him
on
no
account
to
waken
them
he
offered
to
open
the
little
door
at
the
side
and
let
us
crawl
in
we
insisted
that
we
could
not
think
of
intruding
what
we
would
like
we
said
is
to
hear
something
of
your
methods
of
work
in
novel
we
said
this
with
very
peculiar
conviction
quite
apart
from
the
immediate
purposes
of
our
interview
we
have
always
been
most
anxious
to
know
by
what
process
novels
are
written
if
we
could
get
to
know
this
we
would
write
one
ourselves
come
and
see
my
bulls
first
said
the
novelist
i
ve
got
a
couple
of
young
bulls
here
in
the
paddock
that
will
interest
we
felt
sure
that
they
would
he
led
us
to
a
little
green
fence
inside
it
were
two
ferocious
looking
animals
eating
grain
they
rolled
their
eyes
upwards
at
us
as
they
ate
how
do
those
strike
you
he
asked
we
assured
him
that
they
struck
us
as
our
beau
ideal
of
bulls
like
to
walk
in
beside
them
said
the
novelist
opening
a
little
gate
we
drew
back
was
it
fair
to
disturb
these
bulls
the
great
novelist
noticed
our
hesitation
don
t
be
afraid
he
said
they
re
not
likely
to
harm
you
i
send
my
hired
man
right
in
beside
them
every
morning
without
the
slightest
we
looked
at
the
eminent
novelist
with
admiration
we
realized
that
like
so
many
of
our
writers
actors
and
even
our
thinkers
of
he
was
an
man
in
every
sense
of
the
word
but
we
shook
our
heads
bulls
we
explained
were
not
a
department
of
research
for
which
we
were
equipped
what
we
wanted
we
said
was
to
learn
something
of
his
methods
of
work
my
methods
of
work
he
answered
as
we
turned
up
the
path
again
well
really
i
hardly
know
that
i
have
what
is
your
plan
or
method
we
asked
getting
out
our
notebook
and
pencil
of
laying
the
beginning
of
a
new
novel
my
usual
plan
said
the
novelist
is
to
come
out
here
and
sit
in
the
stye
till
i
get
my
does
it
take
long
we
questioned
not
very
i
generally
find
that
a
quiet
spent
among
the
hogs
will
give
me
at
least
my
leading
and
what
do
you
do
next
oh
after
that
i
generally
light
a
pipe
and
go
and
sit
among
the
beehives
looking
for
an
do
you
get
it
we
asked
invariably
after
that
i
make
a
few
notes
then
go
off
for
a
ten
mile
tramp
with
my
esquimaux
dogs
and
get
back
in
time
to
have
a
go
through
the
cattle
sheds
and
take
a
romp
with
the
young
we
sighed
we
couldn
t
help
it
novel
writing
seemed
further
away
than
ever
have
you
also
a
goat
on
the
premises
we
asked
oh
certainly
a
ripping
old
fellow
come
along
and
see
we
shook
our
heads
no
doubt
our
disappointment
showed
in
our
face
it
often
does
we
felt
that
it
was
altogether
right
and
wholesome
that
our
great
novels
of
should
be
written
in
this
fashion
with
the
help
of
goats
dogs
hogs
and
young
bulls
but
we
felt
too
that
it
was
not
for
us
we
permitted
ourselves
one
further
question
at
what
time
we
said
do
you
rise
in
the
morning
oh
anywhere
between
four
and
five
said
the
novelist
ah
and
do
you
generally
take
a
cold
dip
as
soon
as
you
are
up
even
in
winter
i
you
prefer
no
doubt
we
said
with
a
dejection
that
we
could
not
conceal
to
have
water
with
a
good
coat
of
ice
over
it
oh
certainly
we
said
no
more
we
have
long
understood
the
reasons
for
our
own
failure
in
life
but
it
was
painful
to
receive
a
renewed
corroboration
of
it
this
ice
question
has
stood
in
our
way
for
years
the
great
novelist
seemed
to
note
our
dejection
come
to
the
house
he
said
my
wife
will
give
you
a
cup
of
in
a
few
moments
we
had
forgotten
all
our
troubles
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
charming
chatelaines
it
has
been
our
lot
to
meet
we
sat
on
a
low
stool
immediately
beside
ethelinda
afterthought
who
presided
in
her
own
gracious
fashion
over
the
so
you
want
to
know
something
of
my
methods
of
work
she
said
as
she
poured
hot
tea
over
our
leg
we
do
we
answered
taking
out
our
little
book
and
recovering
something
of
our
enthusiasm
we
do
not
mind
hot
tea
being
poured
over
us
if
people
treat
us
as
a
human
being
can
you
indicate
we
continued
what
method
you
follow
in
beginning
one
of
your
novels
i
always
begin
said
ethelinda
afterthought
with
a
a
study
we
queried
yes
i
mean
a
study
of
actual
facts
take
for
example
my
from
the
life
of
a
steam
more
tea
no
no
we
said
well
to
make
that
book
i
first
worked
two
years
in
a
two
years
we
exclaimed
and
why
to
get
the
the
steam
we
questioned
oh
no
said
afterthought
i
did
that
separately
i
took
a
course
in
steam
at
a
technical
is
it
possible
we
said
our
heart
beginning
to
sing
again
was
all
that
necessary
i
don
t
see
how
one
could
do
it
otherwise
the
story
opens
as
no
doubt
you
remember
tea
in
the
boiler
room
of
the
yes
we
said
moving
our
leg
no
thank
so
you
see
the
only
possible
d
was
to
begin
with
a
description
of
the
inside
of
the
we
nodded
a
masterly
thing
we
said
my
wife
interrupted
the
great
novelist
who
was
sitting
with
the
head
of
a
huge
danish
hound
in
his
lap
sharing
his
buttered
toast
with
the
dog
while
he
adjusted
a
set
of
trout
flies
is
a
great
do
you
always
work
on
that
method
we
asked
always
she
answered
for
of
the
i
spent
six
months
in
a
knitting
mill
for
of
the
mud
i
made
special
studies
for
months
and
of
what
sort
we
asked
in
mud
learning
to
model
it
you
see
for
a
story
of
that
sort
the
first
thing
needed
is
a
thorough
knowledge
of
mud
all
kinds
of
and
what
are
you
doing
next
we
inquired
my
next
book
said
the
lady
novelist
is
to
be
a
study
tea
of
the
pickle
industry
perfectly
new
a
fascinating
field
we
murmured
and
quite
new
several
of
our
writers
have
done
the
and
in
england
a
good
deal
has
been
done
in
jam
but
so
far
no
one
has
done
pickles
i
should
like
if
i
could
added
ethelinda
afterthought
with
the
graceful
modesty
that
is
characteristic
of
her
to
make
it
the
first
of
a
series
of
pickle
novels
showing
don
t
you
know
the
whole
pickle
district
and
perhaps
following
a
family
of
pickle
workers
for
four
or
five
four
or
five
we
said
enthusiastically
make
it
ten
and
have
you
any
plan
for
work
beyond
that
oh
yes
indeed
laughed
the
lady
novelist
i
am
always
planning
ahead
what
i
want
to
do
after
that
is
a
study
of
the
inside
of
a
of
the
we
said
with
a
shudder
yes
to
do
it
of
course
i
shall
go
to
jail
for
two
or
three
years
but
how
can
you
get
in
we
asked
thrilled
at
the
quiet
determination
of
the
frail
woman
before
us
i
shall
demand
it
as
a
right
she
answered
quietly
i
shall
go
to
the
authorities
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
enthusiastic
women
and
demand
that
i
shall
be
sent
to
jail
surely
after
the
work
i
have
done
that
much
is
coming
to
it
certainly
is
we
said
warmly
we
rose
to
go
both
the
novelists
shook
hands
with
us
with
great
cordiality
afterthought
walked
as
far
as
the
front
door
with
us
and
showed
us
a
short
cut
past
the
beehives
that
could
take
us
directly
through
the
bull
pasture
to
the
main
road
we
walked
away
in
the
gathering
darkness
of
evening
very
quietly
we
made
up
our
mind
as
we
went
that
novel
writing
is
not
for
us
we
must
reach
the
penitentiary
in
some
other
way
but
we
thought
it
well
to
set
down
our
interview
as
a
guide
to
others
ix
the
new
education
so
you
re
going
back
to
college
in
a
fortnight
i
said
to
the
bright
young
thing
on
the
veranda
of
the
summer
hotel
aren
t
you
sorry
in
a
way
i
am
she
said
but
in
another
sense
i
m
glad
to
go
back
one
can
t
loaf
all
the
she
looked
up
from
her
over
her
red
cross
knitting
with
great
earnestness
how
full
of
purpose
these
modern
students
are
i
thought
to
myself
in
my
time
we
used
to
go
back
to
college
as
to
a
treadmill
i
know
that
i
said
but
what
i
mean
is
that
college
after
all
is
a
pretty
hard
grind
things
like
mathematics
and
greek
are
no
joke
are
they
in
my
day
as
i
remember
it
we
used
to
think
spherical
trigonometry
about
the
hardest
stuff
of
the
she
looked
dubious
i
didn
t
mathematics
she
said
oh
i
said
i
see
so
you
don
t
have
to
take
it
and
what
you
elected
for
this
coming
half
semester
that
s
six
weeks
you
know
i
ve
elected
social
ah
i
said
that
s
since
my
day
what
is
it
oh
it
s
interesting
it
s
the
study
of
what
kind
of
conditions
i
asked
all
conditions
perhaps
i
can
t
explain
it
properly
but
i
have
the
prospectus
of
it
indoors
if
you
d
like
to
see
it
we
take
up
and
what
do
you
do
with
it
analyse
it
she
said
but
it
must
mean
reading
a
tremendous
lot
of
no
she
answered
we
don
t
use
books
in
this
course
it
s
all
laboratory
now
i
mystified
i
said
what
do
you
mean
by
laboratory
work
well
answered
the
girl
student
with
a
thoughtful
look
upon
her
face
you
see
we
are
supposed
to
break
society
up
into
its
in
six
weeks
some
of
the
girls
do
it
in
six
weeks
some
put
in
a
whole
semester
and
take
twelve
weeks
at
so
as
to
break
up
pretty
thoroughly
i
said
yes
she
assented
but
most
of
the
girls
think
six
weeks
is
that
ought
to
pulverize
it
pretty
completely
but
how
do
you
go
at
it
well
the
girl
said
it
s
all
done
with
laboratory
work
we
take
for
instance
department
stores
i
think
that
is
the
first
thing
we
do
we
take
up
the
department
and
what
do
you
do
with
it
we
study
it
as
a
social
ah
i
said
as
a
social
yes
said
the
girl
delighted
to
see
that
i
was
beginning
to
understand
as
a
germ
all
the
work
is
done
in
the
concrete
the
class
goes
down
with
the
professor
to
the
department
store
itself
and
then
then
they
walk
all
through
it
but
have
none
of
them
ever
been
in
a
departmental
store
before
oh
of
course
but
you
see
we
go
as
ah
now
i
understand
you
mean
you
don
t
buy
anything
and
so
you
are
able
to
watch
everything
no
she
said
it
s
not
that
we
do
buy
things
that
s
part
of
it
most
of
the
girls
like
to
buy
little
and
anyway
it
gives
them
a
good
chance
to
do
their
shopping
while
they
re
there
but
while
they
there
they
are
observing
then
afterwards
they
make
charts
of
what
i
asked
charts
of
the
employes
they
re
used
to
show
the
brain
movement
do
you
find
much
well
she
said
hesitatingly
the
idea
is
to
reduce
all
the
employes
to
a
to
a
curve
i
exclaimed
an
in
or
an
no
no
not
exactly
that
didn
t
you
use
curves
when
you
were
at
college
never
i
said
oh
well
nowadays
nearly
everything
you
know
is
done
into
a
curve
we
put
them
on
the
and
what
is
this
particular
curve
of
the
employe
used
for
i
asked
why
said
the
student
the
idea
is
that
from
the
curve
we
can
get
the
norm
of
the
get
his
norm
i
asked
yes
get
the
norm
that
stands
for
the
root
form
of
the
employe
as
a
social
and
what
can
you
do
with
that
oh
when
we
have
that
we
can
tell
what
the
employe
would
do
under
any
and
every
circumstance
at
least
that
s
the
idea
though
i
m
really
only
quoting
she
added
breaking
off
in
a
diffident
way
from
what
miss
thinker
the
professor
of
social
endeavour
says
she
s
really
fine
she
s
making
a
general
chart
of
the
female
employes
of
one
of
the
biggest
stores
to
show
what
percentage
in
case
of
fire
would
jump
out
of
the
window
and
what
percentage
would
run
to
the
fire
it
s
a
wonderful
course
i
said
we
had
nothing
like
it
when
i
went
to
college
and
does
it
only
take
in
departmental
stores
no
said
the
girl
the
laboratory
work
includes
for
this
semester
parlours
as
what
do
you
do
with
we
take
them
up
as
social
cells
nuclei
i
think
the
professor
calls
and
how
do
you
go
at
them
i
asked
why
the
girls
go
to
them
in
little
laboratory
groups
and
study
they
eat
in
them
they
she
said
to
make
it
concrete
but
while
they
are
doing
it
they
are
considering
the
parlour
merely
as
a
section
of
social
does
the
professor
go
i
asked
oh
yes
she
heads
each
group
professor
thinker
never
spares
herself
from
dear
me
i
said
you
must
be
kept
very
busy
and
is
social
endeavour
all
that
you
are
going
to
do
no
she
answered
i
m
electing
a
in
nature
work
as
nature
work
well
well
that
i
suppose
means
cramming
up
a
lot
of
biology
and
zoology
does
it
not
no
said
the
girl
it
s
not
exactly
done
with
books
i
believe
it
is
all
done
by
field
field
work
yes
field
work
four
times
a
week
and
an
excursion
every
and
what
do
you
do
in
the
field
work
the
girls
she
answered
go
out
in
groups
anywhere
out
of
doors
and
make
a
nature
study
of
anything
they
how
do
they
do
that
i
asked
why
they
look
at
it
suppose
for
example
they
come
to
a
stream
or
a
pond
or
anything
yes
well
they
at
had
they
never
done
that
before
i
asked
ah
but
they
look
at
it
as
a
nature
unit
each
girl
must
take
forty
units
in
the
course
i
think
we
only
do
one
unit
each
day
we
go
it
must
i
said
be
pretty
fatiguing
work
and
what
about
the
excursion
that
s
every
saturday
we
go
out
with
miss
stalk
the
professor
of
and
where
do
you
go
oh
anywhere
one
day
we
go
perhaps
for
a
trip
on
a
steamer
and
another
saturday
somewhere
in
motors
and
so
doing
what
i
asked
field
work
the
aim
of
the
course
i
m
afraid
i
m
quoting
miss
stalk
but
i
don
t
mind
she
s
really
fine
is
to
break
nature
into
its
elements
i
see
so
as
to
view
it
as
the
external
structure
of
society
and
make
deductions
from
have
you
made
any
i
asked
oh
no
she
laughed
i
m
only
starting
the
work
this
term
but
of
course
i
shall
have
to
each
girl
makes
at
least
one
deduction
at
the
end
of
the
course
some
of
the
seniors
make
two
or
three
but
you
have
to
make
it
s
a
great
course
i
said
no
wonder
you
are
going
to
be
busy
and
as
you
say
how
much
better
than
loafing
round
here
doing
isn
t
it
said
the
girl
student
with
enthusiasm
in
her
eyes
it
gives
one
such
a
sense
of
purpose
such
a
feeling
of
doing
it
must
i
answered
oh
goodness
she
exclaimed
there
s
the
lunch
bell
i
must
skip
and
get
she
was
just
vanishing
from
my
side
when
the
burly
male
student
who
was
also
staying
in
the
hotel
came
puffing
up
after
his
run
he
was
getting
himself
into
trim
for
enlistment
so
he
told
me
he
noted
the
retreating
form
of
the
college
girl
as
he
sat
down
i
ve
just
been
talking
to
her
i
said
about
her
college
work
she
seems
to
be
studying
a
queer
lot
of
stuff
social
endeavour
and
all
that
awful
piffle
said
the
young
man
but
the
girls
naturally
run
to
all
that
sort
of
rot
you
now
your
work
i
went
on
is
no
doubt
very
different
i
mean
what
you
were
taking
before
the
war
came
along
i
suppose
you
fellows
have
an
awful
dose
of
mathematics
and
philology
and
so
on
just
as
i
did
in
my
college
days
something
like
a
blush
came
across
the
face
of
the
handsome
youth
well
no
he
said
i
didn
t
mathematics
at
our
college
you
know
we
two
majors
and
two
i
see
i
said
and
what
were
you
i
turkish
music
and
religion
he
answered
oh
yes
i
said
with
a
sort
of
reverential
respect
fitting
yourself
for
a
position
of
in
a
turkish
cathedral
no
no
no
he
said
i
m
going
into
insurance
but
you
see
those
subjects
fitted
in
better
than
anything
fitted
in
yes
turkish
comes
at
nine
music
at
ten
and
religion
at
eleven
so
they
make
a
good
combination
they
leave
a
man
free
to
to
develop
his
mind
i
said
we
used
to
find
in
my
college
days
that
lectures
interfered
with
it
badly
but
now
turkish
that
must
be
an
interesting
language
eh
search
me
said
the
student
all
you
have
to
do
is
answer
the
roll
and
go
out
forty
give
you
one
turkish
unit
but
say
i
must
get
on
i
ve
got
to
change
so
i
could
not
help
reflecting
as
the
young
man
left
me
on
the
great
changes
that
have
come
over
our
college
education
it
was
a
relief
to
me
later
in
the
day
to
talk
with
a
quiet
sombre
man
himself
a
graduate
student
in
philosophy
on
this
topic
he
agreed
with
me
that
the
old
strenuous
studies
seem
to
be
very
largely
abandoned
i
looked
at
the
sombre
man
with
respect
now
your
work
i
said
is
very
different
from
what
these
young
people
are
doing
hard
solid
definite
effort
what
a
relief
it
must
be
to
you
to
get
a
brief
vacation
up
here
i
couldn
t
help
thinking
as
i
watched
you
moving
round
doing
nothing
how
fine
it
must
feel
for
you
to
come
up
here
after
your
hard
work
and
put
in
a
month
of
loafing
he
said
indignantly
i
m
not
loafing
i
m
putting
in
a
half
summer
course
in
introspection
that
s
why
i
m
here
i
get
credit
for
two
majors
for
my
time
ah
i
said
as
gently
as
i
could
you
get
credit
he
left
me
i
am
still
pondering
over
our
new
education
meantime
i
think
i
shall
enter
my
little
boy
s
name
on
the
books
of
tuskegee
college
where
the
education
is
still
x
the
errors
of
santa
claus
it
was
christmas
eve
the
browns
who
lived
in
the
adjoining
house

been
dining
with
the
joneses

and
jones
were
sitting
over

and
walnuts
at
the
table

others

to
your
boy

brown

jones

a
look
at
it
said
brown
jones
fetched
a
parcel
from
the
sideboard
and
began
unwrapping
it
ingenious
thing
isn
t
it
he
said

on
its
own
rails

to
play
with
trains

t
it

assented
brown
how
are
the
rails

ll
show
you
said
jones
just
help
me
to
shove
these
dinner
things
aside
and
roll
back
the
cloth
there
see
you
lay
the
rails
like
that
and
fasten
them
at
the
ends
so
oh
yes
i
catch
on
makes
a
grade
doesn
t
it
just
the
thing
to
amuse
a
child
isn
t
it
i
got
willy
a
toy
i
know
they
re
great
i
got
edwin
one
on
his
birthday
but
i
thought
i
d
get
him
a
train
this
time
i
told
him
santa
claus
was
going
to
bring
him
something
altogether
new
this
time
edwin
of
course
believes
in
santa
claus
absolutely
say
look
at
this
locomotive
would
you
it
has
a
spring
coiled
up
inside
the
fire
wind
her
up
said
brown
with
great
interest
let
s
see
her
all
right
said
jones
just
pile
up
two
or
three
plates
or
something
to
lean
the
end
of
the
rails
on
there
notice
the
way
it
buzzes
before
it
starts
isn
t
that
a
great
thing
for
a
kid
eh
yes
said
brown
and
say
see
this
little
string
to
pull
the
whistle
by
gad
it
toots
eh
just
like
real
now
then
brown
jones
went
on
you
hitch
on
those
cars
and
i
ll
start
her
i
ll
be
engineer
eh
half
an
hour
later
brown
and
jones
were
still
playing
trains
on
the
table
but
their
wives
upstairs
in
the
hardly
noticed
their
absence
they
were
too
much
interested
oh
i
think
it
s
perfectly
sweet
said
brown
just
the
loveliest
doll
i
ve
seen
in
years
i
must
get
one
like
it
for
ulvina
won
t
clarisse
be
perfectly
enchanted
yes
answered
jones
and
then
she
ll
have
all
the
fun
of
arranging
the
dresses
children
love
that
so
much
look
there
are
three
little
dresses
with
the
doll
aren
t
they
cute
all
cut
out
and
ready
to
stitch
oh
how
perfectly
lovely
exclaimed
brown
i
think
the
mauve
one
would
suit
the
doll
best
don
t
you
with
such
golden
hair
only
don
t
you
think
it
would
make
it
much
nicer
to
turn
back
the
collar
so
and
to
put
a
little
band
so
a
good
idea
said
jones
do
let
s
try
it
just
wait
i
ll
get
a
needle
in
a
minute
i
ll
tell
clarisse
that
santa
claus
sewed
it
himself
the
child
believes
in
santa
claus
and
half
an
hour
later
jones
and
brown
were
so
busy
stitching
dolls
clothes
that
they
could
not
hear
the
roaring
of
the
little
train
up
and
down
the
dining
table
and
had
no
idea
what
the
four
children
were
doing
nor
did
the
children
miss
their
mothers
dandy
aren
t
they
edwin
jones
was
saying
to
little
willie
brown
as
they
sat
in
edwin
s
bedroom
a
hundred
in
a
box
with
cork
tips
and

an
amber
mouthpiece
that

answered
willie
i
d
like

immensely
i
only

begin
smoking
cigarettes
too
soon

t
you

stunts
him
i
waited
till
i
was

said
edwin
as

t
for
dad
i
simply
to
give
him
something
from
santa
claus
he
believes
in
santa
claus
absolutely
you
and
while
this
was
going
on
clarisse
was
showing
little
ulvina
the
absolutely
lovely
little
bridge
set
that
she
got
for
her
mother
aren
t
these
markers
perfectly
charming
said
ulvina
and
don
t
you
love
this
little
dutch
design
or
is
it
flemish
darling
dutch
said
clarisse
isn
t
it
quaint
and
aren
t
these
the
dearest
little
things
for
putting
the
money
in
when
you
play
i
needn
t
have
got
them
with
it
they
d
have
sold
the
rest
separately
but
i
think
it
s
too
utterly
slow
playing
without
money
don
t
you
oh
abominable
shuddered
ulvina
but
your
mamma
never
plays
for
money
does
she
mamma
oh
gracious
no
mamma
s
far
too
slow
for
that
but
i
shall
tell
her
that
santa
claus
insisted
on
putting
in
the
little
money
i
suppose
she
believes
in
santa
claus
just
as
my
mamma
oh
absolutely
said
clarisse
and
added
what
if
we
play
a
little
game
with
a
double
dummy
the
french
way
or
norwegian
skat
if
you
like
that
only
needs
all
right
agreed
ulvina
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
deep
in
a
game
of
cards
with
a
little
pile
of
pocket
money
beside
them
about
half
an
hour
later
all
the
members
of
the
two
families
were
again
in
the
but
of
course
nobody
said
anything
about
the
presents
in
any
case
they
were
all
too
busy
looking
at
the
beautiful
big
bible
with
maps
in
it
that
the
joneses
had
brought
to
give
to
grandfather
they
all
agreed
that
with
the
help
of
it
grandfather
could
hunt
up
any
place
in
palestine
in
a
moment
day
or
night
but
upstairs
away
upstairs
in
a
of
his
own
grandfather
jones
was
looking
with
an
affectionate
eye
at
the
presents
that
stood
beside
him
there
was
a
beautiful
whisky
decanter
with
silver
filigree
outside
and
whiskey
inside
for
jones
and
for
the
little
boy
a
big
jew
s
harp
later
on
far
in
the
night
the
person
or
the
influence
or
whatever
it
is
called
santa
claus
took
all
the
presents
and
placed
them
in
the
people
s
stockings
and
being
blind
as
he
always
has
been
he
gave
the
wrong
things
to
the
wrong
people
in
fact
he
gave
them
just
as
indicated
above
but
the
next
day
in
the
course
of
christmas
morning
the
situation
straightened
itself
out
just
as
it
always
does
indeed
by
ten
o
clock
brown
and
jones
were
playing
with
the
train
and
brown
and
jones
were
making
dolls
clothes
and
the
boys
were
smoking
cigarettes
and
clarisse
and
ulvina
were
playing
cards
for
their
and
upstairs
away
up
grandfather
was
drinking
whisky
and
playing
the
jew
s
harp
and
so
christmas
just
as
it
always
does
turned
out
all
right
after
all
xi
lost
in
new
york
a
visitor
s
soliloquy
well
well
whatever
has
been
happening
to
this
place
to
new
york
changed
changed
since
i
was
here
in
well
i
should
say
so
the
of
the
old
days
that
i
used
to
find
waiting
for
me
at
the
station
curb
with
that
impossible
horse
of
his
the
with
his
bulbous
red
face
and
the
nice
smell
of
rye
whisky
all
round
him
for
yards
gone
so
it
seems
for
ever
and
in
place
of
him
this
what
is
it
they
call
it
taxi
with
a
steering
it
get
in
he
says
just
that
he
doesn
t
offer
to
help
me
or
lift
my
satchel
all
right
young
man
i
m
crawling
in
that
s
the
machine
that
marks
it
eh
i
suppose
they
have
them
rigged
up
so
they
can
punch
up
anything
they
like
i
thought
so
he
hits
it
up
to
fifty
cents
before
we
start
but
i
saw
him
do
it
well
i
can
stand
for
it
this
time
i
ll
not
be
caught
in
one
of
these
again
the
hotel
all
right
i
m
getting
out
my
hotel
but
what
is
it
they
have
done
to
it
they
must
have
added
ten
stories
to
it
it
reaches
to
the
sky
but
i
ll
not
try
to
look
to
the
top
of
it
not
with
this
satchel
in
my
hand
no
sir
i
ll
wait
till
i
m
safe
inside
in
there
i
ll
feel
all
right
they
ll
know
me
in
there
they
ll
remember
right
away
my
visit
in
the
fall
of
they
won
t
easily
have
forgotten
that
big
dinner
i
gave
nine
people
at
a
dollar
fifty
a
plate
with
the
cigars
extra
the
clerk
will
remember
all
right
know
me
not
they
the
know
me
how
could
he
for
it
seems
now
there
isn
t
any
clerk
or
not
as
there
used
to
be
they
have
subdivided
him
somehow
into
five
or
six
there
is
a
man
behind
a
desk
a
majestic
sort
of
man
waving
his
hand
it
would
be
sheer
madness
to
claim
acquaintance
with
him
there
is
another
with
a
great
book
adjusting
cards
in
it
and
another
behind
glass
labelled
cashier
and
busy
as
a
bank
there
are
two
with
mail
and
telegrams
they
are
all
too
busy
to
know
me
shall
i
sneak
up
near
to
them
keeping
my
satchel
in
my
hand
i
wonder
do
they
me
they
see
me
a
mere
thing
like
me
i
am
within
ten
feet
of
them
but
i
am
certain
that
they
can
not
see
me
i
am
and
i
feel
it
absolutely
invisible
ha
one
has
seen
me
he
turns
to
me
or
rather
he
rounds
upon
me
with
the
words
well
sir
that
and
nothing
else
sharp
and
hard
there
is
none
of
the
ancient
kindly
pretence
of
knowing
my
name
no
reaching
out
a
welcome
hand
and
calling
me
er
er
till
he
has
read
my
name
upside
down
while
i
am
writing
it
and
can
address
me
as
a
familiar
friend
no
friendly
questioning
about
the
crops
in
my
part
of
the
country
the
crops
forsooth
what
do
these
young
men
know
about
crops
a
room
had
i
any
reservation
any
which
any
reservation
oh
i
see
had
i
written
down
from
home
to
say
that
i
was
coming
no
i
had
not
because
the
truth
is
i
came
at
very
short
notice
i
didn
t
know
till
a
week
before
that
my
he
is
not
listening
he
has
moved
away
i
will
stand
and
wait
till
he
comes
back
i
am
intruding
here
i
had
no
right
to
disturb
these
people
like
this
oh
i
can
have
a
room
at
eleven
o
clock
when
it
is
which
is
vacated
oh
yes
i
see
when
the
man
in
it
gets
up
and
goes
away
i
didn
t
for
the
minute
catch
on
to
what
the
word
he
has
stopped
listening
never
mind
i
can
wait
from
eight
to
eleven
is
only
three
hours
anyway
i
will
move
about
here
and
look
at
things
if
i
keep
moving
they
will
notice
me
less
ha
books
and
news
papers
and
magazines
what
a
stack
of
them
like
a
regular
i
will
stand
here
and
take
a
look
at
some
of
them
eh
what
s
that
did
i
want
to
anything
well
no
i
hadn
t
exactly
i
was
just
oh
i
see
they
re
on
all
right
yes
give
me
this
one
fifty
cents
all
right
and
this
and
these
others
that
s
all
right
miss
i
m
not
stingy
they
always
say
of
me
up
in
our
town
that
when
i
she
has
stopped
listening
never
mind
i
will
walk
up
and
down
again
with
the
magazines
under
my
arm
that
will
make
people
think
i
live
here
better
still
if
i
could
put
the
magazines
in
my
satchel
but
how
there
is
no
way
to
set
it
down
and
undo
the
straps
i
wonder
if
i
could
dare
put
it
for
a
minute
on
that
table
the
polished
one
or
no
they
wouldn
t
likely
allow
a
man
to
put
a
bag
well
i
can
wait
anyway
it
s
eight
o
clock
and
soon
surely
breakfast
will
be
ready
as
soon
as
i
hear
the
gong
i
can
go
in
there
i
wonder
if
i
could
find
out
first
where
the
is
it
used
always
to
be
marked
across
the
door
but
i
don
t
seem
to
see
it
darn
it
i
ll
ask
that
man
in
uniform
if
i
m
here
prepared
to
spend
my
good
money
to
get
breakfast
i
guess
i
m
not
scared
to
ask
a
simple
question
of
a
man
in
uniform
or
no
i
ll
not
ask
i
ll
try
this
one
or
no
he
s
busy
i
ll
ask
this
other
boy
say
would
you
mind
if
you
please
telling
me
please
which
way
the
eh
what
do
i
want
which
the
grill
room
or
the
palm
room
why
i
tell
you
young
man
i
just
wanted
to
get
some
breakfast
if
it
s
what
do
i
want
what
i
didn
t
quite
get
that
la
no
thanks
and
what
s
that
table
de
what
in
the
palm
room
no
i
just
wanted
but
it
doesn
t
matter
i
ll
wait
round
here
and
look
about
till
i
hear
the
gong
don
t
worry
about
me
what
s
that
what
s
that
boy
shouting
out
that
boy
with
the
tray
a
call
for
something
or
other
say
must
be
something
happened
pretty
serious
a
call
for
why
that
s
for
me
hullo
i
am
here
it
s
me
here
i
wanted
at
the
desk
all
right
i
m
coming
i
m
hurrying
i
guess
something
s
wrong
at
home
eh
i
that
s
my
name
i
m
ready
oh
a
room
you
ve
got
a
room
for
me
all
right
the
fifteenth
floor
good
heavens
away
up
there
never
mind
i
ll
take
it
can
t
give
me
a
bath
that
s
all
right
i
had
one
elevator
over
this
way
all
right
i
ll
come
along
thanks
i
can
carry
it
but
i
don
t
see
any
elevator
oh
this
door
in
the
wall
well
i
m
hanged
this
the
elevator
it
certainly
has
changed
the
elevator
that
i
remember
had
a
rope
in
the
middle
of
it
and
you
pulled
the
rope
up
as
you
went
wheezing
and
clanking
all
the
way
to
the
fifth
floor
but
this
looks
a
queer
sort
of
machine
how
do
you
do
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
in
the
road
of
the
door
i
guess
excuse
me
i
m
afraid
i
got
in
the
way
of
your
elbow
it
s
all
right
you
didn
t
hurt
or
not
bad
gee
whiz
it
goes
fast
are
you
sure
you
can
stop
it
better
be
careful
young
man
there
was
an
elevator
once
in
our
town
that
fifteenth
floor
all
right
this
room
eh
great
scott
it
s
high
up
say
better
not
go
too
near
that
window
boy
that
would
be
a
hell
of
a
drop
if
a
feller
fell
out
you
needn
t
wait
oh
i
see
i
beg
your
pardon
i
suppose
a
quarter
is
enough
eh
well
it
s
a
relief
to
be
alone
but
say
this
is
high
up
and
what
a
noise
what
is
it
they
re
doing
out
there
away
out
in
the
air
with
all
that
clatter
building
a
steel
building
i
guess
well
those
fellers
have
their
nerve
all
right
i
ll
sit
further
back
from
the
window
it
s
lonely
up
here
in
the
old
days
i
could
have
rung
a
bell
and
had
a
drink
sent
up
to
the
room
but
away
up
here
on
the
fifteenth
floor
oh
no
they
d
never
send
a
drink
clean
up
to
the
fifteenth
floor
of
course
in
the
old
days
i
could
have
put
on
my
canvas
slippers
and
walked
down
to
the
bar
and
had
a
drink
and
talked
to
the
but
of
course
they
wouldn
t
have
a
bar
in
a
place
like
this
i
d
like
to
go
down
and
see
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
d
care
to
ask
anyway
no
i
guess
i
ll
just
sit
and
wait
some
one
will
come
for
me
i
guess
after
a
while
if
i
were
back
right
now
in
our
town
i
could
walk
into
ed
clancey
s
restaurant
and
have
ham
and
eggs
or
steak
and
eggs
or
anything
for
cents
our
town
up
home
is
a
peach
of
a
little
town
anyway
say
i
just
feel
as
if
i
d
like
to
take
my
satchel
and
jump
clean
out
of
that
window
it
would
be
a
good
rebuke
to
them
but
pshaw
what
would
care
xii
this
strenuous
age
something
is
happening
i
regret
to
find
to
the
world
in
which
we
used
to
live
the
poor
old
thing
is
being
speeded
there
is
efficiency
in
the
air
offices
open
at
eight
o
clock
millionaires
lunch
on
a
baked
apple
bankers
eat
practically
nothing
a
college
president
has
declared
that
there
are
more
foot
pounds
of
energy
in
a
glass
of
peptonized
milk
than
in
something
else
i
forget
what
all
this
is
very
fine
yet
somehow
i
feel
out
of
it
my
friends
are
failing
me
they
won
t
sit
up
after
midnight
they
have
taken
to
sleeping
out
of
doors
on
porches
and
pergolas
some
i
understand
merely
roost
on
plain
wooden
bars
they
rise
early
they
take
deep
breathing
they
bathe
in
ice
water
they
are
no
good
this
change
i
am
sure
is
excellent
it
is
i
am
certain
just
as
it
ought
to
be
i
am
merely
saying
quietly
and
humbly
that
i
am
not
in
it
i
am
being
left
behind
take
for
example
the
case
of
alcohol
that
at
least
is
what
it
is
called
now
there
were
days
when
we
called
it
bourbon
whisky
and
tom
gin
and
when
the
very
name
of
it
breathed
romance
that
time
is
past
the
poor
stuff
is
now
called
alcohol
and
none
so
low
that
he
has
a
good
word
for
it
quite
right
i
am
certain
i
don
t
defend
it
alcohol
they
are
saying
if
taken
in
sufficient
quantities
tears
all
the
outer
coating
off
the
diaphragm
it
leaves
the
epigastric
tissue
so
i
am
informed
a
useless
wreck
this
i
don
t
deny
it
gets
they
tell
me
into
the
brain
i
don
t
dispute
it
it
turns
the
prosencephalon
into
mere
punk
i
know
it
i
ve
felt
it
doing
it
they
tell
me
and
i
believe
it
that
after
even
one
glass
of
alcohol
or
shall
we
say
scotch
whisky
and
soda
a
man
s
working
power
is
lowered
by
twenty
per
cent
this
is
a
dreadful
thing
after
three
glasses
so
it
is
held
his
capacity
for
sustained
rigid
thought
is
cut
in
two
and
after
about
six
glasses
the
man
s
working
power
is
reduced
by
at
least
a
hundred
per
cent
he
merely
sits
there
in
his
at
his
club
let
us
say
with
all
power
even
all
to
work
gone
out
of
him
not
thinking
rigidly
not
sustaining
his
thought
a
mere
shapeless
chunk
of
geniality
half
hidden
in
the
blue
smoke
of
his
cigar
very
dreadful
not
a
doubt
alcohol
is
doomed
it
is
going
it
is
gone
yet
when
i
think
of
a
hot
scotch
on
a
winter
evening
or
a
tom
collins
on
a
summer
morning
or
a
gin
rickey
beside
a
or
a
stein
of
beer
on
a
bench
beside
a
i
wish
somehow
that
we
could
prohibit
the
use
of
alcohol
and
merely
drink
beer
and
whisky
and
gin
as
we
used
to
but
these
things
it
appears
interfere
with
work
they
have
got
to
go
but
turn
to
the
broader
and
simpler
question
of
itself
in
my
time
one
hated
it
it
was
viewed
as
the
natural
enemy
of
man
now
the
world
has
fallen
in
love
with
it
my
friends
i
find
take
their
deep
breathing
and
their
porch
sleeping
because
it
makes
them
work
better
they
go
for
a
week
s
vacation
in
virginia
not
for
its
own
sake
but
because
they
say
they
can
work
better
when
they
get
back
i
know
a
man
who
wears
very
loose
boots
because
he
can
work
better
in
them
and
another
who
wears
only
soft
shirts
because
he
can
work
better
in
a
soft
shirt
there
are
plenty
of
men
now
who
would
wear
if
they
thought
they
could
work
more
in
it
i
know
another
man
who
walks
away
out
into
the
country
every
sunday
not
that
he
likes
the
country
he
wouldn
t
recognize
a
bumble
bee
if
he
saw
it
but
he
claims
that
if
he
walks
on
sunday
his
head
is
as
clear
as
a
bell
for
work
on
monday
against
work
itself
i
say
nothing
but
i
sometimes
wonder
if
i
stand
alone
in
this
thing
am
i
the
person
left
who
hates
it
nor
is
work
all
take
food
i
admit
here
and
now
that
the
lunch
i
like
best
i
mean
for
an
ordinary
plain
lunch
not
a
party
is
a
beef
steak
about
one
foot
square
and
two
inches
thick
can
i
work
on
it
no
i
can
t
but
i
can
work
in
spite
of
it
that
is
as
much
as
one
used
to
ask
years
ago
yet
now
i
find
that
all
my
friends
boast
ostentatiously
about
the
meagre
lunch
they
eat
one
tells
me
that
he
finds
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
prune
is
quite
as
much
as
he
cares
to
take
another
says
that
a
dry
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
water
is
all
that
his
brain
will
stand
one
lunches
on
the
white
of
an
egg
another
eats
merely
the
yolk
i
have
only
two
friends
left
who
can
eat
a
whole
egg
at
a
time
i
understand
that
the
fear
of
these
men
is
that
if
they
eat
more
than
an
egg
or
a
biscuit
they
will
feel
heavy
after
lunch
why
they
object
to
feeling
heavy
i
do
not
know
personally
i
enjoy
it
i
like
nothing
better
than
to
sit
round
after
a
heavy
lunch
with
half
a
dozen
heavy
friends
smoking
heavy
cigars
i
am
well
aware
that
that
is
wicked
i
merely
confess
the
fact
i
do
not
palliate
it
nor
is
food
all
nor
drink
nor
work
nor
open
air
there
has
spread
abroad
along
with
the
physical
efficiency
a
perfect
passion
for
somehow
if
a
man
s
stomach
is
empty
and
his
head
clear
as
a
bell
and
if
he
won
t
drink
and
won
t
smoke
he
reaches
out
for
information
he
wants
facts
he
reads
the
newspapers
all
though
instead
of
only
reading
the
headings
he
clamours
for
articles
filled
with
statistics
about
illiteracy
and
alien
immigration
and
the
number
of
battleships
in
the
japanese
navy
i
know
quite
a
lot
of
men
who
have
actually
bought
the
new
what
is
more
they
the
thing
they
sit
in
their
apartments
at
night
with
a
glass
of
water
at
their
elbow
reading
the
encyclopaedia
they
say
that
it
is
literally
filled
with
facts
other
men
spend
their
time
reading
the
statistical
abstract
of
the
united
states
they
say
the
figures
in
it
are
great
and
the
acts
of
congress
and
the
list
of
presidents
since
washington
or
was
it
washington
spending
their
evenings
thus
and
topping
it
off
with
a
cold
baked
apple
and
sleeping
out
in
the
snow
they
go
to
work
in
the
morning
so
they
tell
me
with
a
positive
sense
of
exhilaration
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
do
but
for
me
i
confess
that
once
and
for
all
i
am
out
of
it
i
am
left
behind
add
to
it
all
such
rising
dangers
as
total
prohibition
and
the
female
franchise
the
daylight
saving
and
eugenic
marriage
together
with
proportional
representation
the
initiative
and
the
referendum
and
the
duty
of
the
citizen
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
politics
and
i
admit
that
i
shall
not
be
sorry
to
go
away
from
here
but
before
i
go
i
have
one
hope
i
understand
that
down
in
hayti
things
are
very
different
bull
fights
cock
fights
dog
fights
are
openly
permitted
business
never
begins
till
eleven
in
the
morning
everybody
sleeps
after
lunch
and
the
bars
remain
open
all
night
marriage
is
but
a
casual
relation
in
fact
the
general
condition
of
morality
so
they
tell
me
is
lower
in
hayti
than
it
has
been
anywhere
since
the
time
of
nero
me
for
hayti
xiii
the
old
old
story
of
how
five
men
went
fishing
this
is
a
plain
account
of
a
fishing
party
it
is
not
a
story
there
is
no
plot
nothing
happens
in
it
and
nobody
is
hurt
the
only
point
of
this
narrative
is
its
peculiar
truth
it
not
only
tells
what
happened
to
us
the
five
people
concerned
in
it
but
what
has
happened
and
is
happening
to
all
the
other
fishing
parties
that
at
the
season
of
the
year
from
halifax
to
idaho
go
gliding
out
on
the
unruffled
surface
of
our
canadian
and
american
lakes
in
the
still
cool
of
early
summer
morning
we
decided
to
go
in
the
early
morning
because
there
is
a
popular
belief
that
the
early
morning
is
the
right
time
for
bass
fishing
the
bass
is
said
to
bite
in
the
early
morning
perhaps
it
does
in
fact
the
thing
is
almost
capable
of
scientific
proof
the
bass
does
bite
between
eight
and
twelve
it
does
bite
between
twelve
and
six
in
the
afternoon
nor
does
it
bite
between
six
o
clock
and
midnight
all
these
things
are
known
facts
the
inference
is
that
the
bass
bites
furiously
at
about
daybreak
at
any
rate
our
party
were
unanimous
about
starting
early
better
make
an
early
start
said
the
colonel
when
the
idea
of
the
party
was
suggested
oh
yes
said
george
popley
the
bank
manager
we
want
to
get
right
out
on
the
shoal
while
the
fish
are
when
he
said
this
all
our
eyes
glistened
everybody
s
do
there
s
a
thrill
in
the
words
to
get
right
out
on
the
shoal
at
daybreak
when
the
fish
are
biting
is
an
idea
that
goes
to
any
man
s
brain
if
you
listen
to
the
men
talking
in
a
pullman
car
or
an
hotel
corridor
or
better
still
at
the
little
tables
in
a
bar
you
will
not
listen
long
before
you
hear
one
say
well
we
got
out
early
just
after
sunrise
right
on
the
and
presently
even
if
you
can
t
hear
him
you
will
see
him
reach
out
his
two
hands
and
hold
them
about
two
feet
apart
for
the
other
man
to
admire
he
is
measuring
the
fish
no
not
the
fish
they
caught
this
was
the
big
one
that
they
lost
but
they
had
him
right
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
oh
yes
he
was
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
all
right
the
number
of
huge
fish
that
have
been
heaved
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
in
our
lakes
is
almost
incredible
or
at
least
it
used
to
be
when
we
still
had
bar
rooms
and
little
tables
for
serving
that
vile
stuff
scotch
whisky
and
such
foul
things
as
gin
rickeys
and
john
collinses
it
makes
one
sick
to
think
of
it
doesn
t
it
but
there
was
good
fishing
in
the
bars
all
the
winter
but
as
i
say
we
decided
to
go
early
in
the
morning
charlie
jones
the
railroad
man
said
that
he
remembered
how
when
he
was
a
boy
up
in
wisconsin
they
used
to
get
out
at
five
in
the
morning
not
get
up
at
five
but
be
on
the
shoal
at
five
it
appears
that
there
is
a
shoal
somewhere
in
wisconsin
where
the
bass
lie
in
thousands
kernin
the
lawyer
said
that
when
he
was
a
boy
this
was
on
lake
rosseau
they
used
to
get
out
at
four
it
seems
there
is
a
shoal
in
lake
rosseau
where
you
can
haul
up
the
bass
as
fast
as
you
can
drop
your
line
the
shoal
is
hard
to
find
very
hard
kernin
can
find
it
but
it
is
doubtful
so
i
gather
if
any
other
living
man
can
the
wisconsin
shoal
too
is
very
difficult
to
find
once
you
find
it
you
are
all
right
but
it
s
hard
to
find
charlie
jones
can
find
it
if
you
were
in
wisconsin
right
now
he
d
take
you
straight
to
it
but
probably
no
other
person
now
alive
could
reach
that
shoal
in
the
same
way
colonel
morse
knows
of
a
shoal
in
lake
simcoe
where
he
used
to
fish
years
and
years
ago
and
which
i
understand
he
can
still
find
i
have
mentioned
that
kernin
is
a
lawyer
and
jones
a
railroad
man
and
popley
a
banker
but
i
needn
t
have
any
reader
would
take
it
for
granted
in
any
fishing
party
there
is
always
a
lawyer
you
can
tell
him
at
sight
he
is
the
one
of
the
party
that
has
a
landing
net
and
a
steel
rod
in
sections
with
a
wheel
that
is
used
to
wind
the
fish
to
the
top
of
the
water
and
there
is
always
a
banker
you
can
tell
him
by
his
good
clothes
popley
in
the
bank
wears
his
banking
suit
when
he
goes
fishing
he
wears
his
fishing
suit
it
is
much
the
better
of
the
two
because
his
banking
suit
has
ink
marks
on
it
and
his
fishing
suit
has
no
fish
marks
on
it
as
for
the
railroad
man
quite
so
the
reader
knows
it
as
well
as
i
do
you
can
tell
him
because
he
carries
a
pole
that
he
cut
in
the
bush
himself
with
a
line
wrapped
round
the
end
of
it
jones
says
he
can
catch
as
many
fish
with
this
kind
of
line
as
kernin
can
with
his
patent
rod
and
wheel
so
he
can
too
just
the
same
number
but
kernin
says
that
with
his
patent
apparatus
if
you
get
a
fish
on
you
can
him
jones
says
to
hades
with
him
give
him
a
fish
on
his
line
and
he
ll
haul
him
in
all
right
kernin
says
he
d
lose
him
but
jones
says
wouldn
t
in
fact
he
to
haul
the
fish
in
kernin
says
that
more
than
once
in
lake
rosseau
he
has
played
a
fish
for
over
half
an
hour
i
forget
now
why
he
stopped
i
think
the
fish
quit
playing
i
have
heard
kernin
and
jones
argue
this
question
of
their
two
rods
as
to
which
rod
can
best
pull
in
the
fish
for
half
an
hour
others
may
have
heard
the
same
question
debated
i
know
no
way
by
which
it
could
be
settled
our
arrangement
to
go
fishing
was
made
at
the
little
golf
club
of
our
summer
town
on
the
veranda
where
we
sit
in
the
evening
oh
it
s
just
a
little
place
nothing
pretentious
the
links
are
not
much
good
for
in
fact
we
don
t
play
much
there
so
far
as
golf
goes
and
of
course
we
don
t
serve
meals
at
the
club
it
s
not
like
that
and
no
we
ve
nothing
to
drink
there
because
of
prohibition
but
we
go
and
there
it
is
a
good
place
to
and
after
all
what
else
can
you
do
in
the
present
state
of
the
law
so
it
was
there
that
we
arranged
the
party
the
thing
somehow
seemed
to
fall
into
the
mood
of
each
of
us
jones
said
he
had
been
hoping
that
some
of
the
boys
would
get
up
a
fishing
party
it
was
apparently
the
one
kind
of
pleasure
that
he
really
cared
for
for
myself
i
was
delighted
to
get
in
with
a
crowd
of
regular
fishermen
like
these
four
especially
as
i
hadn
t
been
out
fishing
for
nearly
ten
years
though
fishing
is
a
thing
i
am
passionately
fond
of
i
know
no
pleasure
in
life
like
the
sensation
of
getting
a
bass
on
the
hook
and
hauling
him
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
to
weigh
him
but
as
i
say
i
hadn
t
been
out
for
ten
years
oh
yes
i
live
right
beside
the
water
every
summer
and
yes
certainly
i
am
saying
so
i
am
passionately
fond
of
fishing
but
still
somehow
i
hadn
t
been
every
fisherman
knows
just
how
that
happens
the
years
have
a
way
of
slipping
by
yet
i
must
say
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
so
keen
a
sport
as
jones
hadn
t
been
out
so
it
presently
appeared
for
eight
years
i
had
imagined
he
practically
lived
on
the
water
and
colonel
morse
and
kernin
i
was
amazed
to
find
hadn
t
been
out
for
twelve
years
not
since
the
day
so
it
came
out
in
conversation
when
they
went
out
together
in
lake
rosseau
and
kernin
landed
a
perfect
monster
a
regular
corker
five
pounds
and
a
half
they
said
or
no
i
don
t
think
he
him
no
i
remember
he
didn
t
him
he
caught
him
and
he
have
landed
him
he
should
have
landed
him
but
he
land
him
that
was
it
yes
i
remember
kernin
and
morse
had
a
slight
discussion
about
it
oh
perfectly
amicable
as
to
whether
morse
had
fumbled
with
the
net
or
whether
kernin
the
whole
argument
was
perfectly
friendly
had
made
an
ass
of
himself
by
not
striking
soon
enough
of
course
the
whole
thing
was
so
long
ago
that
both
of
them
could
look
back
on
it
without
any
bitterness
or
ill
nature
in
fact
it
amused
them
kernin
said
it
was
the
most
laughable
thing
he
ever
saw
in
his
life
to
see
poor
old
jack
that
s
morse
s
name
shoving
away
with
the
landing
net
wrong
side
up
and
morse
said
he
d
never
forget
seeing
poor
old
kernin
yanking
his
line
first
this
way
and
then
that
and
not
knowing
where
to
try
to
haul
it
it
made
him
laugh
to
look
back
at
it
they
might
have
gone
on
laughing
for
quite
a
time
but
charlie
jones
interrupted
by
saying
that
in
his
opinion
a
landing
net
is
a
piece
of
darned
foolishness
here
popley
agrees
with
him
kernin
objects
that
if
you
don
t
use
a
net
you
ll
lose
your
fish
at
the
side
of
the
boat
jones
says
no
give
him
a
hook
well
through
the
fish
and
a
stout
line
in
his
hand
and
that
fish
has
to
come
in
popley
says
so
too
he
says
let
him
have
his
hook
fast
through
the
fish
s
head
with
a
short
stout
line
and
put
him
popley
at
the
other
end
of
that
line
and
that
fish
will
come
in
it
s
to
otherwise
popley
will
know
why
that
s
the
alternative
either
the
fish
must
come
in
or
popley
must
know
why
there
s
no
escape
from
the
logic
of
it
but
perhaps
some
of
my
readers
have
heard
the
thing
discussed
before
so
as
i
say
we
decided
to
go
the
next
morning
and
to
make
an
early
start
all
of
the
boys
were
at
one
about
that
when
i
say
boys
i
use
the
word
as
it
is
used
in
fishing
to
mean
people
from
say
to
there
is
something
about
fishing
that
keeps
men
young
if
a
fellow
gets
out
for
a
good
morning
s
fishing
forgetting
all
business
worries
once
in
a
while
say
once
in
ten
years
it
keeps
him
fresh
we
agreed
to
go
in
a
launch
a
large
launch
to
be
exact
the
largest
in
the
town
we
could
have
gone
in
row
boats
but
a
row
boat
is
a
poor
thing
to
fish
from
kernin
said
that
in
a
row
boat
it
is
impossible
properly
to
your
fish
the
side
of
the
boat
is
so
low
that
the
fish
is
apt
to
leap
over
the
side
into
the
boat
when
half
popley
said
that
there
is
no
comfort
in
a
row
boat
in
a
launch
a
man
can
reach
out
his
feet
and
take
it
easy
charlie
jones
said
that
in
a
launch
a
man
could
rest
his
back
against
something
and
morse
said
that
in
a
launch
a
man
could
rest
his
neck
young
inexperienced
boys
in
the
small
sense
of
the
word
never
think
of
these
things
so
they
go
out
and
after
a
few
hours
their
necks
get
tired
whereas
a
group
of
expert
fishers
in
a
launch
can
rest
their
backs
and
necks
and
even
fall
asleep
during
the
pauses
when
the
fish
stop
biting
anyway
all
the
boys
agreed
that
the
great
advantage
of
a
launch
would
be
that
we
could
get
a
to
take
us
by
that
means
the
man
could
see
to
getting
the
worms
and
the
man
would
be
sure
to
have
spare
lines
and
the
man
could
come
along
to
our
different
places
we
were
all
beside
the
water
and
pick
us
up
in
fact
the
more
we
thought
about
the
advantage
of
having
a
man
to
take
us
the
better
we
liked
it
as
a
boy
gets
old
he
likes
to
have
a
man
around
to
do
the
work
anyway
frank
rolls
the
man
we
decided
to
get
not
only
has
the
biggest
launch
in
town
but
what
is
more
frank
the
lake
we
called
him
up
at
his
over
the
phone
and
said
we
d
give
him
five
dollars
to
take
us
out
first
thing
in
the
morning
provided
that
he
knew
the
shoal
he
said
he
knew
it
i
don
t
know
to
be
quite
candid
about
it
who
mentioned
whisky
first
in
these
days
everybody
has
to
be
a
little
careful
i
imagine
we
had
all
been
whisky
for
some
time
before
anybody
said
it
but
there
is
a
sort
of
convention
that
when
men
go
fishing
they
must
have
whisky
each
man
makes
the
pretence
that
one
thing
he
needs
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
is
cold
raw
whisky
it
is
spoken
of
in
terms
of
affection
one
man
says
the
first
thing
you
need
if
you
re
going
fishing
is
a
good
snort
of
whisky
another
says
that
a
good
snifter
is
the
very
thing
and
the
others
agree
that
no
man
can
fish
properly
without
a
horn
or
a
bracer
or
an
each
man
really
decides
that
he
himself
won
t
take
any
but
he
feels
that
in
a
collective
sense
the
boys
need
it
so
it
was
with
us
the
colonel
said
he
d
bring
along
a
bottle
of
popley
said
no
let
bring
it
kernin
said
let
him
and
charlie
jones
said
no
he
d
bring
it
it
turned
out
that
the
colonel
had
some
very
good
scotch
at
his
house
that
he
d
like
to
bring
oddly
enough
popley
had
some
good
scotch
in
house
too
and
queer
though
it
is
each
of
the
boys
had
scotch
in
his
house
when
the
discussion
closed
we
knew
that
each
of
the
five
of
us
was
intending
to
bring
a
bottle
of
whisky
each
of
the
five
of
us
expected
the
other
to
drink
one
and
a
quarter
bottles
in
the
course
of
the
morning
i
suppose
we
must
have
talked
on
that
veranda
till
long
after
one
in
the
morning
it
was
probably
nearer
two
than
one
when
we
broke
up
but
we
agreed
that
that
made
no
difference
popley
said
that
for
him
three
hours
sleep
the
right
kind
of
sleep
was
far
more
refreshing
than
ten
kernin
said
that
a
lawyer
learns
to
snatch
his
sleep
when
he
can
and
jones
said
that
in
railroad
work
a
man
pretty
well
cuts
out
sleep
so
we
had
no
alarms
whatever
about
not
being
ready
by
five
our
plan
was
simplicity
itself
men
like
ourselves
in
responsible
positions
learn
to
organize
things
easily
in
fact
popley
says
it
is
that
faculty
that
has
put
us
where
we
are
so
the
plan
simply
was
that
frank
rolls
should
come
along
at
five
o
clock
and
blow
his
whistle
in
front
of
our
places
and
at
that
signal
each
man
would
come
down
to
his
wharf
with
his
rod
and
kit
and
so
we
d
be
off
to
the
shoal
without
a
moment
s
delay
the
weather
we
ruled
out
it
was
decided
that
even
if
it
rained
that
made
no
difference
kernin
said
that
fish
bite
better
in
the
rain
and
everybody
agreed
that
man
with
a
couple
of
snorts
in
him
need
have
no
fear
of
a
little
rain
water
so
we
parted
all
keen
on
the
enterprise
nor
do
i
think
even
now
that
there
was
anything
faulty
or
imperfect
in
that
party
as
we
planned
it
i
heard
frank
rolls
blowing
his
infernal
whistle
opposite
my
summer
cottage
at
some
ghastly
hour
in
the
morning
even
without
getting
out
of
bed
i
could
see
from
the
window
that
it
was
no
day
for
fishing
no
not
raining
exactly
i
don
t
mean
that
but
one
of
those
peculiar
days
i
don
t
mean
there
was
no
wind
but
a
sort
of
feeling
in
the
air
that
showed
anybody
who
understands
bass
fishing
that
it
was
a
perfectly
rotten
day
for
going
out
the
fish
i
seemed
to
know
it
wouldn
t
bite
when
i
was
still
fretting
over
the
annoyance
of
the
disappointment
i
heard
frank
rolls
blowing
his
whistle
in
front
of
the
other
cottages
i
counted
thirty
whistles
altogether
then
i
fell
into
a
light
doze
not
exactly
sleep
but
a
sort
of
i
can
find
no
other
word
for
it
it
was
clear
to
me
that
the
other
boys
had
thrown
the
thing
over
there
was
no
use
in
my
trying
to
go
out
alone
i
stayed
where
i
was
my
doze
lasting
till
ten
o
clock
when
i
walked
up
town
later
in
the
morning
i
couldn
t
help
being
struck
by
the
signs
in
the
butcher
s
shops
and
the
restaurants
fish
fresh
fish
fresh
lake
fish
where
in
blazes
do
they
get
those
fish
anyway
xiv
back
from
the
land
i
have
just
come
back
now
with
the
closing
in
of
autumn
to
the
city
i
have
hung
up
my
hoe
in
my
study
my
spade
is
put
away
behind
the
piano
i
have
with
me
seven
pounds
of
paris
green
that
i
had
over
anybody
who
wants
it
may
have
it
i
didn
t
like
to
bury
it
for
fear
of
its
poisoning
the
ground
i
didn
t
like
to
throw
it
away
for
fear
of
its
destroying
cattle
i
was
afraid
to
leave
it
in
my
summer
place
for
fear
that
it
might
poison
the
tramps
who
generally
break
in
in
november
i
have
it
with
me
now
i
move
it
from
room
to
room
as
i
hate
to
turn
my
back
upon
it
anybody
who
wants
it
i
repeat
can
have
it
i
should
like
also
to
give
away
either
to
the
red
cross
or
to
anything
else
ten
packets
of
radish
seed
the
early
curled
variety
i
think
fifteen
packets
of
cucumber
seed
the
long
succulent
variety
i
believe
it
says
and
twenty
packets
of
onion
seed
the
yellow
danvers
distinguished
i
understand
for
its
edible
flavour
and
its
nutritious
properties
it
is
not
likely
that
i
shall
ever
on
this
side
of
the
grave
plant
onion
seed
again
all
these
things
i
have
with
me
my
vegetables
are
to
come
after
me
by
freight
they
are
booked
from
simcoe
county
to
montreal
at
present
they
are
i
believe
passing
through
schenectady
but
they
will
arrive
later
all
right
they
were
seen
going
through
detroit
last
week
moving
west
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
ever
sent
anything
by
freight
anywhere
i
never
understood
before
the
wonderful
organization
of
the
railroads
but
they
tell
me
that
there
is
a
bad
congestion
of
freight
down
south
this
month
if
my
vegetables
get
tangled
up
in
that
there
is
no
telling
when
they
will
arrive
in
other
words
i
am
one
of
the
legion
of
men
quiet
determined
resolute
men
who
went
out
last
spring
to
plant
the
land
and
who
are
now
back
with
me
and
i
am
sure
that
i
speak
for
all
the
others
as
well
it
was
not
a
question
of
mere
pleasure
it
was
no
love
of
gardening
for
its
own
sake
that
inspired
us
it
was
a
plain
national
duty
what
we
said
to
ourselves
was
this
war
has
got
to
stop
the
men
in
the
trenches
thus
far
have
failed
to
stop
it
now
let
try
the
whole
thing
we
argued
is
a
plain
matter
of
food
if
we
raise
enough
food
the
germans
are
bound
to
starve
very
good
let
us
kill
i
suppose
there
was
never
a
more
grimly
determined
set
of
men
went
out
from
the
cities
than
those
who
went
out
last
may
as
i
did
to
conquer
the
food
problem
i
don
t
mean
to
say
that
each
and
every
one
of
us
actually
left
the
city
but
we
all
went
forth
in
the
metaphorical
sense
some
of
the
men
cultivated
back
gardens
others
took
vacant
lots
some
went
out
into
the
suburbs
and
others
like
myself
went
right
out
into
the
country
we
are
now
back
each
of
us
has
with
him
his
paris
green
his
hoe
and
the
rest
of
his
radish
seed
the
time
has
therefore
come
for
a
plain
clear
statement
of
our
experience
we
have
as
everybody
knows
failed
we
have
been
beaten
hack
all
along
the
line
our
potatoes
are
buried
in
a
jungle
of
autumn
burdocks
our
radishes
stand
seven
feet
high
uneatable
our
tomatoes
when
last
seen
were
greener
than
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
august
and
getting
greener
every
week
our
celery
looked
as
delicate
as
a
maidenhair
fern
our
indian
corn
was
nine
feet
high
with
a
tall
feathery
spike
on
top
of
that
but
no
sign
of
anything
eatable
about
it
from
top
to
bottom
i
look
back
with
a
sigh
of
regret
at
those
bright
early
days
in
april
when
we
were
all
buying
hoes
and
talking
soil
and
waiting
for
the
snow
to
be
off
the
ground
the
street
cars
as
we
went
up
and
down
to
our
offices
were
a
busy
babel
of
garden
talk
there
was
a
sort
of
geniality
in
the
air
one
spoke
freely
to
strangers
every
man
with
a
hoe
was
a
friend
men
chewed
straws
in
their
offices
and
kept
looking
out
of
windows
to
pretend
to
themselves
that
they
were
afraid
it
might
blow
up
rain
got
your
tomatoes
in
one
man
would
ask
another
as
they
went
up
in
the
elevator
yes
i
got
mine
in
yesterday
the
other
would
answer
but
i
m
just
a
little
afraid
that
this
east
wind
may
blow
up
a
little
frost
what
we
need
now
is
growing
and
the
two
men
would
drift
off
together
from
the
elevator
door
along
the
corridor
their
heads
together
in
friendly
colloquy
i
have
always
regarded
a
lawyer
as
a
man
without
a
soul
there
is
one
who
lives
next
door
to
me
to
whom
i
have
not
spoken
in
five
years
yet
when
i
saw
him
one
day
last
spring
heading
for
the
suburbs
in
a
pair
of
old
trousers
with
a
hoe
in
one
hand
and
a
box
of
celery
plants
in
the
other
i
felt
that
i
loved
the
man
i
used
to
think
that
were
mere
sordid
calculating
machines
now
that
i
have
seen
whole
firms
of
them
busy
at
the
hoe
wearing
old
trousers
that
reached
to
their
armpits
and
were
tied
about
the
waist
with
a
polka
dot
necktie
i
know
that
they
are
men
i
know
that
there
are
warm
hearts
beating
behind
those
trousers
old
trousers
i
say
where
on
earth
did
they
all
come
from
in
such
a
sudden
fashion
last
spring
everybody
had
them
who
would
suspect
that
a
man
drawing
a
salary
of
ten
thousand
a
year
was
keeping
in
reserve
a
pair
of
breeches
four
sizes
too
large
for
him
just
in
case
a
war
should
break
out
against
germany
talk
of
german
mobilization
i
doubt
whether
the
organizing
power
was
all
on
their
side
after
all
at
any
rate
it
is
estimated
that
fifty
thousand
pairs
of
old
trousers
were
mobilized
in
montreal
in
one
week
but
perhaps
it
was
not
a
case
of
mobilization
or
deliberate
preparedness
it
was
rather
an
illustration
of
the
primitive
instinct
that
is
in
all
of
us
and
that
will
out
in
war
any
man
worth
the
name
would
wear
old
breeches
all
the
time
if
the
world
would
let
him
any
man
will
wind
a
polka
dot
tie
round
his
waist
in
preference
to
wearing
patent
braces
the
makers
of
the
ties
know
this
that
is
why
they
make
the
tie
four
feet
long
and
in
the
same
way
if
any
manufacturer
of
hats
will
put
on
the
market
an
old
fedora
with
a
limp
rim
and
a
mark
where
the
ribbon
used
to
be
but
is
not
a
hat
guaranteed
to
be
six
years
old
well
weathered
well
rained
on
and
certified
to
have
been
walked
over
by
a
herd
of
cattle
that
man
will
make
and
deserve
a
fortune
these
at
least
were
the
fashions
of
last
may
alas
where
are
they
now
the
men
that
wore
them
have
relapsed
again
into
tweeds
they
have
put
on
hard
new
hats
they
are
shining
their
boots
again
they
are
shaving
again
not
merely
on
saturday
night
but
every
day
they
are
sinking
back
into
civilization
yet
those
were
bright
times
and
i
can
not
forbear
to
linger
on
them
nor
the
least
pleasant
feature
was
our
rediscovery
of
the
morning
my
neighbour
on
the
right
was
always
up
at
five
my
neighbour
on
the
left
was
out
and
about
by
four
with
the
earliest
light
of
day
little
columns
of
smoke
rose
along
our
street
from
the
kitchen
ranges
where
our
wives
were
making
coffee
for
us
before
the
servants
got
up
by
six
o
clock
the
street
was
alive
and
busy
with
friendly
salutations
the
milkman
seemed
a
late
comer
a
poor
sluggish
fellow
who
failed
to
appreciate
the
early
hours
of
the
day
a
man
we
found
might
live
through
quite
a
little
iliad
of
adventure
before
going
to
his
nine
o
clock
office
how
will
you
possibly
get
time
to
put
in
a
garden
i
asked
of
one
of
my
neighbours
during
this
glad
period
of
early
spring
before
i
left
for
the
country
time
he
exclaimed
why
my
dear
fellow
i
don
t
have
to
be
down
at
the
warehouse
till
later
in
the
summer
i
saw
the
wreck
of
his
garden
choked
with
weeds
your
garden
i
said
is
in
poor
garden
he
said
indignantly
how
on
earth
can
i
find
time
for
a
garden
do
you
realize
that
i
have
to
be
down
at
the
warehouse
at
when
i
look
back
to
our
bright
beginnings
our
failure
seems
hard
indeed
to
understand
it
is
only
when
i
survey
the
whole
garden
movement
in
melancholy
retrospect
that
i
am
able
to
see
some
of
the
reasons
for
it
the
principal
one
i
think
is
the
question
of
the
season
it
appears
that
the
right
time
to
begin
gardening
is
last
year
for
many
things
it
is
well
to
begin
the
year
before
last
for
good
results
one
must
begin
even
sooner
here
for
example
are
the
directions
as
i
interpret
them
for
growing
asparagus
having
secured
a
suitable
piece
of
ground
preferably
a
deep
friable
loam
rich
in
nitrogen
go
out
three
years
ago
and
plough
or
dig
deeply
remain
a
year
inactive
thinking
two
years
ago
pulverize
the
soil
thoroughly
wait
a
year
as
soon
as
last
year
comes
set
out
the
young
shoots
then
spend
a
quiet
winter
doing
nothing
the
asparagus
will
then
be
ready
to
work
at
year
this
is
the
rock
on
which
we
were
wrecked
few
of
us
were
men
of
sufficient
means
to
spend
several
years
in
quiet
thought
waiting
to
begin
gardening
yet
that
is
it
seems
the
only
way
to
begin
asparagus
demands
a
preparation
of
four
years
to
fit
oneself
to
grow
strawberries
requires
three
years
even
for
such
humble
things
as
peas
beans
and
lettuce
the
instructions
inevitably
read
plough
the
soil
deeply
in
the
preceeding
this
sets
up
a
dilemma
is
the
preceeding
autumn
if
a
man
begins
gardening
in
the
spring
he
is
too
late
for
last
autumn
and
too
early
for
this
on
the
other
hand
if
he
begins
in
the
autumn
he
is
again
too
late
he
has
missed
this
summer
s
crop
it
is
therefore
ridiculous
to
begin
in
the
autumn
and
impossible
to
begin
in
the
spring
this
was
our
first
difficulty
but
the
second
arose
from
the
question
of
the
soil
itself
all
the
books
and
instructions
insist
that
the
selection
of
the
soil
is
the
most
important
part
of
gardening
no
doubt
it
is
but
if
a
man
has
already
selected
his
own
backyard
before
he
opens
the
book
what
remedy
is
there
all
the
books
lay
stress
on
the
need
of
a
deep
friable
loam
full
of
this
i
have
never
seen
my
own
plot
of
land
i
found
on
examination
to
contain
nothing
but
earth
i
could
see
no
trace
of
nitrogen
i
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
loam
there
may
be
such
a
thing
but
i
am
admitting
now
in
all
humility
of
mind
that
i
don
t
know
what
loam
is
last
spring
my
fellow
gardeners
and
i
all
talked
freely
of
the
desirability
of
a
my
own
opinion
is
that
none
of
them
had
any
clearer
ideas
about
it
than
i
had
speaking
from
experience
i
should
say
that
the
only
soils
are
earth
mud
and
dirt
there
are
no
others
but
i
leave
out
the
soil
in
any
case
we
were
mostly
forced
to
disregard
it
perhaps
a
more
fruitful
source
of
failure
even
than
the
lack
of
loam
was
the
attempt
to
apply
calculation
and
mathematics
to
gardening
thus
if
one
cabbage
will
grow
in
one
square
foot
of
ground
how
many
cabbages
will
grow
in
ten
square
feet
of
ground
ten
not
at
all
the
answer
is
you
will
find
as
a
matter
of
practical
experience
that
however
many
cabbages
you
plant
in
a
garden
plot
there
will
be
only
that
will
really
grow
this
you
will
presently
come
to
speak
of
as
beside
it
all
the
others
till
the
caterpillars
finally
finish
their
existence
will
look
but
poor
lean
things
but
cabbage
will
be
a
source
of
pride
and
an
object
of
display
to
visitors
in
fact
it
would
ultimately
have
grown
to
be
a
cabbage
such
as
you
buy
for
ten
cents
at
any
market
were
it
not
that
you
inevitably
cut
it
and
eat
it
when
it
is
still
only
this
always
happens
to
the
one
cabbage
that
is
of
decent
size
and
to
the
one
tomato
that
shows
signs
of
turning
red
it
is
really
a
feeble
and
to
the
only
melon
that
might
have
lived
to
ripen
they
get
eaten
no
one
but
a
practised
professional
gardener
can
live
and
sleep
beside
a
melon
ripe
and
a
cabbage
grown
without
going
out
and
tearing
it
off
the
stem
even
at
that
it
is
not
a
bad
plan
to
eat
the
stuff
while
you
can
the
most
peculiar
thing
about
gardening
is
that
all
of
a
sudden
everything
is
too
old
to
eat
radishes
change
over
night
from
delicate
young
shoots
not
large
enough
to
put
on
the
table
into
huge
plants
seven
feet
high
with
a
root
like
an
irish
shillelagh
if
you
take
your
eyes
off
a
lettuce
bed
for
a
week
the
lettuces
not
ready
to
eat
when
you
last
looked
at
them
have
changed
into
a
tall
jungle
of
hollyhocks
green
peas
are
only
really
green
for
about
two
hours
before
that
they
are
young
peas
after
that
they
are
old
peas
cucumbers
are
the
worst
case
of
all
they
change
overnight
from
delicate
little
bulbs
obviously
too
slight
and
dainty
to
pick
to
old
cases
of
yellow
leather
filled
with
seeds
if
i
were
ever
to
garden
again
a
thing
which
is
out
of
the
bounds
of
possibility
i
should
wait
until
a
certain
day
and
hour
when
all
the
plants
were
ripe
and
then
go
out
with
a
gun
and
shoot
them
all
dead
so
that
they
could
grow
no
more
but
calculation
i
repeat
is
the
bane
of
gardening
i
knew
among
our
group
of
food
producers
a
party
of
young
engineers
college
men
who
took
an
empty
farm
north
of
the
city
as
the
scene
of
their
summer
operations
they
took
their
coats
off
and
applied
college
methods
they
ran
out
first
a
base
line
ab
and
measured
off
from
it
lateral
spurs
mn
op
qr
and
so
on
from
these
they
took
side
angles
with
a
theodolite
so
as
to
get
the
edges
of
each
of
the
separate
plots
of
their
land
absolutely
correct
i
saw
them
working
at
it
all
through
one
saturday
afternoon
in
may
they
talked
as
they
did
it
of
the
peculiar
ignorance
of
the
practical
farmer
he
never
so
they
agreed
uses
his
head
he
never
i
think
i
have
their
phrase
correct
stops
to
think
in
laying
out
his
ground
for
use
it
never
occurs
to
him
to
try
to
get
the
maximum
result
from
a
given
space
if
a
farmer
would
only
realize
that
the
contents
of
a
circle
represent
the
maximum
of
space
enclosable
in
a
given
perimeter
and
that
a
circle
is
merely
a
function
of
its
own
radius
what
a
lot
of
time
he
would
save
these
young
men
that
i
speak
of
laid
out
their
field
with
little
white
posts
at
even
distances
they
made
a
blueprint
of
the
whole
thing
as
they
planted
it
every
corner
of
it
was
charted
out
the
yield
was
calculated
to
a
nicety
they
had
allowed
for
the
fact
that
some
of
the
stuff
might
fail
to
grow
by
introducing
what
they
called
a
coefficient
of
by
means
of
this
and
by
reducing
the
variation
of
autumn
prices
to
a
mathematical
curve
those
men
not
only
knew
already
in
the
middle
of
may
the
exact
yield
of
their
farm
to
within
half
a
bushel
they
allowed
they
said
a
variation
of
half
a
bushel
per
fifty
acres
but
they
knew
beforehand
within
a
few
cents
the
market
value
that
they
would
receive
the
figures
as
i
remember
them
were
simply
amazing
it
seemed
incredible
that
fifty
acres
could
produce
so
much
yet
there
were
the
plain
facts
in
front
of
one
calculated
out
the
thing
amounted
practically
to
a
revolution
in
farming
at
least
it
ought
to
have
and
it
would
have
if
those
young
men
had
come
again
to
hoe
their
field
but
it
turned
out
most
unfortunately
that
they
were
busy
to
their
great
regret
they
were
too
busy
to
come
they
had
been
working
under
a
arrangement
each
man
was
to
give
what
time
he
could
every
saturday
it
was
left
to
every
man
s
honour
to
do
what
he
could
there
was
no
compulsion
each
man
trusted
the
others
to
be
there
in
fact
the
thing
was
not
only
an
experiment
in
food
production
it
was
also
a
new
departure
in
social
the
first
saturday
that
those
young
men
worked
there
were
so
i
have
been
told
of
them
driving
in
white
stakes
and
running
lines
the
next
saturday
there
were
fifteen
of
them
planting
potatoes
the
rest
were
busy
the
week
after
that
there
was
one
man
hoeing
weeds
after
that
silence
fell
upon
the
deserted
garden
broken
only
by
the
cry
of
the
and
the
feeding
on
the
waving
heads
of
the
thistles
but
i
have
indicated
only
two
or
three
of
the
ways
of
failing
at
food
production
there
are
ever
so
many
more
what
amazes
me
in
returning
to
the
city
is
to
find
the
enormous
quantities
of
produce
of
all
sorts
offered
for
sale
in
the
markets
it
is
an
odd
thing
that
last
spring
by
a
queer
oversight
we
never
thought
any
of
us
of
this
process
of
increasing
the
supply
if
every
patriotic
man
would
simply
take
a
large
basket
and
go
to
the
market
every
day
and
buy
all
that
he
could
carry
away
there
need
be
no
further
fear
of
a
food
famine
and
meantime
my
own
vegetables
are
on
their
way
they
are
in
a
soap
box
with
bars
across
the
top
coming
by
freight
they
weigh
pounds
including
the
box
they
represent
the
result
of
four
months
arduous
toil
in
sun
wind
and
storm
yet
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
i
shall
be
able
to
feed
with
them
some
poor
family
of
refugees
during
the
rigour
of
the
winter
either
that
or
give
them
to
the
hens
i
certainly
won

eat

rotten
things

simple
stories
of
success
or
how
to
succeed
in
life
let
me
begin
with
a
sort
of
parable
many
years
ago
when
i
was
on
the
staff
of
a
great
public
school
we
engaged
a
new
swimming
master
he
was
the
most
successful
man
in
that
capacity
that
we
had
had
for
years
then
one
day
it
was
discovered
that
he
couldn
t
swim
he
was
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
swimming
tank
explaining
the
breast
stroke
to
the
boys
in
the
water
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
in
he
was
drowned
or
no
he
wasn
t
drowned
i
remember
he
was
rescued
by
some
of
the
pupils
whom
he
had
taught
to
swim
after
he
was
resuscitated
by
the
boys
it
was
one
of
the
things
he
had
taught
them
the
school
dismissed
him
then
some
of
the
boys
who
were
sorry
for
him
taught
him
how
to
swim
and
he
got
a
new
job
as
a
swimming
master
in
another
place
but
this
time
he
was
an
utter
failure
he
swam
well
but
they
said
he
couldn
t
so
his
friends
looked
about
to
get
him
a
new
job
this
was
just
at
the
time
when
the
bicycle
craze
came
in
they
soon
found
the
man
a
position
as
an
instructor
in
bicycle
riding
as
he
had
never
been
on
a
bicycle
in
his
life
he
made
an
admirable
teacher
he
stood
fast
on
the
ground
and
said
now
then
all
you
need
is
then
one
day
he
got
afraid
that
he
might
be
found
out
so
he
went
out
to
a
quiet
place
and
got
on
a
bicycle
at
the
top
of
a
slope
to
learn
to
ride
it
the
bicycle
ran
away
with
him
but
for
the
skill
and
daring
of
one
of
his
pupils
who
saw
him
and
rode
after
him
he
would
have
been
killed
this
story
as
the
reader
sees
is
endless
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
man
i
speak
of
is
now
in
an
aviation
school
teaching
people
to
fly
they
say
he
is
one
of
the
best
aviators
that
ever
walked
according
to
all
the
legends
and
story
books
the
principal
factor
in
success
is
perseverance
personally
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
it
if
anything
the
truth
lies
the
other
way
there
is
an
old
motto
that
runs
if
at
first
you
don
t
succeed
try
try
this
is
nonsense
it
ought
to
read
if
at
first
you
don
t
succeed
quit
quit
at
if
you
can
t
do
a
thing
more
or
less
the
first
time
you
try
you
will
never
do
it
try
something
else
while
there
is
yet
time
let
me
illustrate
this
with
a
story
i
remember
long
years
ago
at
a
little
school
that
i
attended
in
the
country
we
had
a
schoolmaster
who
used
perpetually
to
write
on
the
blackboard
in
a
copperplate
hand
the
motto
that
i
have
just
quoted
if
at
first
you
don
t
succeed
try
try
he
wore
plain
clothes
and
had
a
hard
determined
face
he
was
studying
for
some
sort
of
preliminary
medical
examination
and
was
saving
money
for
a
medical
course
every
now
and
then
he
went
away
to
the
city
and
tried
the
examination
and
he
always
failed
each
time
he
came
back
he
would
write
up
on
the
blackboard
try
try
and
always
he
looked
grimmer
and
more
determined
than
before
the
strange
thing
was
that
with
all
his
industry
and
determination
he
would
break
out
every
now
and
then
into
drunkenness
and
lie
round
the
tavern
at
the
crossroads
and
the
school
would
be
shut
for
two
days
then
he
came
back
more
fiercely
resolute
than
ever
even
children
could
see
that
the
man
s
life
was
a
fight
it
was
like
the
battle
between
good
and
evil
in
milton
s
epics
well
after
he
had
tried
it
four
times
the
schoolmaster
at
last
passed
the
examination
and
he
went
away
to
the
city
in
a
suit
of
store
clothes
with
eight
hundred
dollars
that
he
had
saved
up
to
study
medicine
now
it
happened
that
he
had
a
brother
who
was
not
a
bit
like
himself
but
was
a
sort
of
ne
always
and
sponging
on
other
people
and
never
working
and
when
the
schoolmaster
came
to
the
city
and
his
brother
knew
that
he
had
eight
hundred
dollars
he
came
to
him
and
got
him
drinking
and
persuaded
him
to
hand
over
the
eight
hundred
dollars
and
to
let
him
put
it
into
the
louisiana
state
lottery
in
those
days
the
louisiana
lottery
had
not
yet
been
forbidden
the
use
of
the
mails
and
you
could
buy
a
ticket
for
anything
from
one
dollar
up
the
grand
prize
was
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
the
seconds
were
a
hundred
thousand
each
so
the
brother
persuaded
the
schoolmaster
to
put
the
money
in
he
said
he
had
a
system
for
buying
only
the
tickets
with
prime
numbers
that
won
t
divide
by
anything
and
that
it
must
win
he
said
it
was
a
mathematical
certainty
and
he
figured
it
out
with
the
schoolmaster
in
the
back
room
of
a
saloon
with
a
box
of
dominoes
on
the
table
to
show
the
plan
of
it
he
told
the
schoolmaster
that
he
himself
would
only
take
ten
per
cent
of
what
they
made
as
a
commission
for
showing
the
system
and
the
schoolmaster
could
have
the
rest
so
in
a
mad
moment
the
schoolmaster
handed
over
his
roll
of
money
and
that
was
the
last
he
ever
saw
of
it
the
next
morning
when
he
was
up
he
was
fierce
with
rage
and
remorse
for
what
he
had
done
he
could
not
go
back
to
the
school
and
he
had
no
money
to
go
forward
so
he
stayed
where
he
was
in
the
little
hotel
where
he
had
got
drunk
and
went
on
drinking
he
looked
so
fierce
and
unkempt
that
in
the
hotel
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
the
watched
him
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
wondering
what
he
would
do
because
they
knew
that
there
was
only
one
end
possible
and
they
waited
for
it
to
come
and
presently
it
came
one
of
the
went
up
to
the
schoolmaster
s
room
to
bring
up
a
letter
and
he
found
him
lying
on
the
bed
with
his
face
grey
as
ashes
and
his
eyes
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
he
was
stone
dead
life
had
beaten
him
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
the
letter
that
the
bartender
carried
up
that
morning
was
from
the
management
of
the
louisiana
lottery
it
contained
a
draft
on
new
york
signed
by
the
treasurer
of
the
state
of
louisiana
for
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
schoolmaster
had
won
the
grand
prize
the
above
story
i
am
afraid
is
a
little
gloomy
i
put
it
down
merely
for
the
moral
it
contained
and
i
became
so
absorbed
in
telling
it
that
i
almost
forgot
what
the
moral
was
that
it
was
meant
to
convey
but
i
think
the
idea
is
that
if
the
schoolmaster
had
long
before
abandoned
the
study
of
medicine
for
which
he
was
not
fitted
and
gone
in
let
us
say
for
playing
the
banjo
he
might
have
become
in
a
minstrel
show
yes
that
was
it
let
me
pass
on
to
other
elements
in
success
i
suppose
that
anybody
will
admit
that
the
peculiar
quality
that
is
called
initiative
the
ability
to
act
promptly
on
one
s
own
judgement
is
a
factor
of
the
highest
importance
i
have
seen
this
illustrated
two
or
three
times
in
a
very
striking
fashion
i
knew
in
toronto
it
is
long
years
ago
a
singularly
bright
young
man
whose
name
was
robinson
he
had
had
some
training
in
the
iron
and
steel
business
and
when
i
knew
him
was
on
the
look
out
for
an
opening
i
met
him
one
day
in
a
great
hurry
with
a
valise
in
his
hand
where
are
you
going
i
asked
over
to
england
he
said
there
is
a
firm
in
liverpool
that
have
advertised
that
they
want
an
agent
here
and
i
m
going
over
to
apply
for
the
can
t
you
do
it
by
letter
i
asked
that
s
just
it
said
robinson
with
a
chuckle
all
the
other
men
will
apply
by
letter
i
ll
go
right
over
myself
and
get
there
as
soon
or
sooner
than
the
letters
i
ll
be
the
man
on
the
spot
and
i
ll
get
the
he
was
quite
right
he
went
over
to
liverpool
and
was
back
in
a
fortnight
with
english
clothes
and
a
big
salary
but
i
can
not
recommend
his
story
to
my
friends
in
fact
it
should
not
be
told
too
freely
it
is
apt
to
be
dangerous
i
remember
once
telling
this
story
of
robinson
to
a
young
man
called
tomlinson
who
was
out
of
a
job
tomlinson
had
a
head
two
sizes
too
big
and
a
face
like
a
bun
he
had
lost
three
jobs
in
a
bank
and
two
in
a
broker
s
office
but
he
knew
his
work
and
on
paper
he
looked
a
good
man
i
told
him
about
robinson
to
encourage
him
and
the
story
made
a
great
impression
say
that
was
a
great
scheme
eh
he
kept
repeating
he
had
no
command
of
words
and
always
said
the
same
thing
over
and
over
a
few
days
later
i
met
tomlinson
in
the
street
with
a
valise
in
his
hand
where
are
you
going
i
asked
i
m
off
to
mexico
he
answered
they
re
advertising
for
a
canadian
teller
for
a
bank
in
tuscapulco
i
ve
sent
my
credentials
down
and
i
m
going
to
follow
them
right
up
in
person
in
a
thing
like
this
the
personal
element
is
so
tomlinson
went
down
to
mexico
and
he
travelled
by
sea
to
mexico
city
and
then
with
a
mule
train
to
tuscapulco
but
the
mails
with
his
credentials
went
by
land
and
got
there
two
days
ahead
of
him
when
tomlinson
got
to
tuscapulco
he
went
into
the
bank
and
he
spoke
to
the
junior
manager
and
told
him
what
he
came
for
i
m
awfully
sorry
the
junior
manager
said
i
m
afraid
that
this
post
has
just
been
then
he
went
into
an
inner
room
to
talk
with
the
manager
the
tellership
that
you
wanted
a
canadian
for
he
asked
didn
t
you
say
that
you
have
a
man
already
yes
said
the
manager
a
brilliant
young
fellow
from
toronto
his
name
is
tomlinson
i
have
his
credentials
here
a
man
i
ve
wired
him
to
come
right
along
at
our
expense
and
we
ll
keep
the
job
open
for
him
ten
there
s
a
young
man
outside
said
the
junior
who
wants
to
apply
for
the
outside
exclaimed
the
manager
how
did
he
get
here
came
in
on
the
mule
train
this
morning
says
he
can
do
the
work
and
wants
the
what
s
he
like
asked
the
manager
the
junior
shook
his
head
pretty
dusty
looking
customer
he
said
shifty
same
old
story
murmured
the
manager
it
s
odd
how
these
fellows
drift
down
here
isn
t
it
up
to
something
crooked
at
home
i
suppose
understands
the
working
of
a
bank
eh
i
guess
he
understands
it
a
little
too
well
for
my
taste
no
no
he
continued
tapping
the
papers
that
lay
on
the
table
now
that
we
ve
got
a
man
like
tomlinson
let
s
hang
on
to
him
we
can
easily
wait
ten
days
and
the
cost
of
the
journey
is
nothing
to
the
bank
as
compared
with
getting
a
man
of
tomlinson
s
stamp
and
by
the
way
you
might
telephone
to
the
chief
of
police
and
get
him
to
see
to
it
that
this
loafer
gets
out
of
town
straight
so
the
chief
of
police
shut
up
tomlinson
in
the
calaboose
and
then
sent
him
down
to
mexico
city
under
a
guard
by
the
time
the
police
were
done
with
him
he
was
dead
broke
and
it
took
him
four
months
to
get
back
to
toronto
when
he
got
there
the
place
in
mexico
had
been
filled
long
ago
but
i
can
imagine
that
some
of
my
readers
might
suggest
that
i
have
hitherto
been
dealing
only
with
success
in
a
very
limited
way
and
that
more
interest
would
lie
in
discussing
how
the
really
great
fortunes
are
made
everybody
feels
an
instinctive
interest
in
knowing
how
our
great
captains
of
industry
our
financiers
and
railroad
magnates
made
their
money
here
the
explanation
is
really
a
very
simple
one
there
is
in
fact
only
one
way
to
amass
a
huge
fortune
in
business
or
railway
management
one
must
begin
at
the
bottom
one
must
mount
the
ladder
from
the
lowest
rung
but
this
lowest
rung
is
everything
any
man
who
can
stand
upon
it
with
his
foot
well
poised
his
head
erect
his
arms
braced
and
his
eye
directed
upward
will
inevitably
mount
to
the
top
but
after
all
i
say
this
as
a
kind
of
afterthought
in
conclusion
why
bother
with
success
at
all
i
have
observed
that
the
successful
people
get
very
little
real
enjoyment
out
of
life
in
fact
the
contrary
is
true
if
i
had
to
choose
with
an
eye
to
having
a
really
pleasant
life
between
success
and
ruin
i
should
prefer
ruin
every
time
i
have
several
friends
who
are
completely
ruined
some
two
or
three
times
in
a
large
way
of
course
and
i
find
that
if
i
want
to
get
a
really
good
dinner
where
the
champagne
is
just
as
it
ought
to
be
and
where
hospitality
is
unhindered
by
mean
thoughts
of
expense
i
can
get
it
best
at
the
house
of
a
ruined
man
xvii
in
dry
toronto
a
local
study
of
a
universal
topic
our
readers
our
numerous
readers
who
live
in
equatorial
africa
may
read
this
under
the
title
in
dry
timbucto
those
who
live
in
central
america
will
kindly
call
it
in
dry
it
may
have
been
for
aught
i
know
the
change
from
a
wet
to
a
dry
atmosphere
i
am
told
that
biologically
such
things
profoundly
affect
the
human
system
at
any
rate
i
found
it
impossible
that
night
i
was
on
the
train
from
montreal
to
toronto
to
fall
asleep
a
peculiar
wakefulness
seemed
to
have
seized
upon
me
which
appeared
moreover
to
afflict
the
other
passengers
as
well
in
the
darkness
of
the
car
i
could
distinctly
hear
them
groaning
at
intervals
are
they
ill
i
asked
through
the
curtains
of
the
porter
as
he
passed
no
sir
he
said
they
re
not
those
is
the
toronto
all
in
this
car
i
asked
all
except
that
gen
lman
you
may
have
heard
singing
in
the
smoking
compartment
he
s
booked
through
to
but
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
sleep
came
at
last
with
unusual
heaviness
i
seemed
obliterated
from
the
world
till
all
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
as
it
were
up
and
dressed
and
seated
in
the
observation
car
at
the
back
of
the
train
awaiting
my
arrival
is
this
toronto
i
asked
of
the
pullman
conductor
as
i
peered
through
the
window
of
the
car
the
conductor
rubbed
the
pane
with
his
finger
and
looked
out
i
think
so
he
said
do
we
stop
here
i
asked
i
think
we
do
this
morning
he
answered
i
think
i
heard
the
conductor
say
that
they
have
a
lot
of
milk
cans
to
put
off
here
this
morning
i
ll
just
go
and
find
out
stop
here
broke
in
an
gentleman
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
who
was
sitting
in
the
next
chair
to
mine
do
they
here
i
should
say
they
did
indeed
don
t
you
know
he
added
turning
to
the
pullman
conductor
that
any
train
is
to
stop
here
there
s
a
a
municipal
of
the
city
of
toronto
every
train
to
stop
i
didn
t
know
it
said
the
conductor
humbly
do
you
mean
to
say
continued
the
irascible
gentleman
that
you
have
never
read
the
of
the
city
of
toronto
no
sir
said
the
conductor
the
ignorance
of
these
fellows
said
the
man
in
grey
tweed
swinging
his
chair
round
again
towards
me
we
ought
to
have
a
to
compel
them
to
read
the
i
must
start
an
agitation
for
it
at
here
he
took
out
a
little
red
notebook
and
wrote
something
in
it
murmuring
we
need
a
new
agitation
presently
he
shut
the
book
up
with
a
snap
i
noticed
that
there
was
a
sort
of
peculiar
alacrity
in
everything
he
did
you
sir
he
said
have
of
course
read
our
municipal
oh
yes
i
answered
splendid
aren
t
they
they
read
like
a
you
are
most
flattering
to
our
city
said
the
irascible
gentleman
with
a
bow
yet
you
sir
i
take
it
are
not
from
no
i
answered
as
humbly
as
i
could
i
m
from
ah
said
the
gentleman
as
he
sat
back
and
took
a
thorough
look
at
me
from
montreal
are
you
drunk
no
i
replied
i
don
t
think
but
you
are
for
a
drink
said
my
new
acquaintance
eagerly
you
need
it
eh
you
feel
already
a
kind
of
craving
eh
what
no
i
answered
the
fact
is
it
s
rather
early
in
the
morning
quite
so
broke
in
the
irascible
gentleman
but
i
understand
that
in
montreal
all
the
saloons
are
open
at
seven
and
even
at
that
hour
are
crowded
sir
i
shook
my
head
i
think
that
has
been
exaggerated
i
said
in
fact
we
always
try
to
avoid
crowding
and
jostling
as
far
as
possible
it
is
generally
understood
as
a
matter
of
politeness
that
the
first
place
in
the
line
is
given
to
the
clergy
the
board
of
trade
and
the
heads
of
the
is
it
conceivable
said
the
gentleman
in
grey
one
moment
please
till
i
make
a
note
all
clergy
i
think
you
said
did
you
not
drunk
at
seven
in
the
deplorable
but
here
we
are
at
the
union
station
commodious
is
it
not
justly
admired
in
fact
all
over
the
known
world
observe
he
continued
as
we
alighted
from
the
train
and
made
our
way
into
the
station
the
upstairs
and
the
downstairs
connected
by
flights
of
stairs
quite
unique
and
most
convenient
if
you
don
t
meet
your
friends
downstairs
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
upstairs
if
they
are
not
there
you
simply
come
down
again
but
stop
you
are
going
to
walk
up
the
street
i
ll
go
with
at
the
outer
door
of
the
station
just
as
i
had
remembered
it
stood
a
group
of
hotel
and
porters
but
how
changed
they
were
like
men
blasted
by
a
great
sorrow
one
with
his
back
turned
was
leaning
against
a
post
his
head
buried
on
his
arm
prince
george
hotel
he
groaned
at
intervals
prince
george
another
was
bending
over
a
little
handrail
his
head
sunk
his
arms
almost
trailing
to
the
ground
he
sobbed
a
third
seated
on
a
stool
looked
feebly
up
with
tears
visible
in
his
eyes
walker
house
he
moaned
accommodation
for
then
he
broke
down
and
cried
take
this
handbag
i
said
to
one
of
the
men
to
the
the
man
ceased
his
groaning
for
a
moment
and
turned
to
me
with
something
like
passion
why
do
you
come
to
he
protested
why
not
go
to
one
of
the
others
go
to
he
added
as
he
stirred
with
his
foot
a
miserable
being
who
lay
huddled
on
the
ground
and
murmured
at
intervals
queen
s
but
my
new
friend
who
stood
at
my
elbow
came
to
my
rescue
take
his
bags
he
said
you
ve
got
to
you
know
the
take
it
or
i
ll
call
a
policeman
you
know
my
name
s
narrowpath
i
m
on
the
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
took
the
bag
with
a
murmured
apology
come
along
said
my
companion
whom
i
now
perceived
to
be
a
person
of
dignity
and
civic
importance
i
ll
walk
up
with
you
and
show
you
the
city
as
we
we
had
hardly
got
well
upon
the
street
before
i
realized
the
enormous
change
that
total
prohibition
had
effected
everywhere
were
the
bright
smiling
faces
of
working
people
laughing
and
singing
at
their
tasks
and
early
though
it
was
cracking
jokes
and
asking
one
another
riddles
as
they
worked
i
noticed
one
man
evidently
a
city
employe
in
a
rough
white
suit
busily
cleaning
the
street
with
a
broom
and
singing
to
himself
how
does
the
little
busy
bee
improve
the
shining
another
employe
who
was
handling
a
little
hose
was
singing
little
drops
of
water
little
grains
of
sand
tra
la
la
la
la
prohibition
s
why
do
they
sing
i
asked
are
they
crazy
sing
said
mr
narrowpath
they
can
t
help
it
they
haven
t
had
a
drink
of
whisky
for
four
a
coal
cart
went
by
with
a
driver
no
longer
grimy
and
smudged
but
neatly
dressed
with
a
high
white
collar
and
a
white
silk
tie
my
companion
pointed
at
him
as
he
passed
hasn
t
had
a
glass
of
beer
for
four
months
he
said
notice
the
difference
that
man
s
work
is
now
a
pleasure
to
him
he
used
to
spend
all
his
evenings
sitting
round
in
the
back
parlours
of
the
saloons
beside
the
stove
now
what
do
you
think
he
does
i
have
no
loads
up
his
cart
with
coal
and
goes
for
a
drive
out
in
the
country
ah
sir
you
who
live
still
under
the
curse
of
the
whisky
traffic
little
know
what
a
pleasure
work
itself
becomes
when
drink
and
all
that
goes
with
it
is
eliminated
do
you
see
that
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
with
the
tool
bag
yes
i
said
a
plumber
is
he
not
exactly
a
plumber
used
to
drink
heavily
couldn
t
keep
a
job
more
than
a
week
now
you
can
t
drag
him
from
his
work
came
to
my
house
to
fix
a
pipe
under
the
kitchen
sink
wouldn
t
quit
at
six
o
clock
got
in
under
the
sink
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
stay
said
he
hated
to
go
home
we
had
to
drag
him
out
with
a
rope
but
here
we
are
at
your
we
entered
but
how
changed
the
place
seemed
our
feet
echoed
on
the
flagstones
of
the
deserted
rotunda
at
the
office
desk
sat
a
clerk
silent
and
melancholy
reading
the
bible
he
put
a
marker
in
the
book
and
closed
it
murmuring
leviticus
then
he
turned
to
us
can
i
have
a
room
i
asked
on
the
first
floor
a
tear
welled
up
into
the
clerk
s
eye
you
can
have
the
whole
first
floor
he
said
and
he
added
with
a
half
sob
and
the
second
too
if
you
i
could
not
help
contrasting
his
manner
with
what
it
was
in
the
old
days
when
the
mere
mention
of
a
room
used
to
throw
him
into
a
fit
of
passion
and
when
he
used
to
tell
me
that
i
could
have
a
cot
on
the
roof
till
tuesday
and
after
that
perhaps
a
bed
in
the
stable
things
had
changed
indeed
can
i
get
breakfast
in
the
grill
room
i
inquired
of
the
melancholy
clerk
he
shook
his
head
sadly
there
is
no
grill
room
he
answered
what
would
you
like
oh
some
sort
of
eggs
i
said
and
the
clerk
reached
down
below
his
desk
and
handed
me
a
egg
with
the
shell
off
here
s
your
egg
he
said
and
there
s
ice
water
there
at
the
end
of
the
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
went
on
reading
you
don
t
understand
said
mr
narrowpath
who
still
stood
at
my
elbow
all
that
elaborate
grill
room
breakfast
business
was
just
a
mere
relic
of
the
drinking
days
sheer
waste
of
time
and
loss
of
efficiency
go
on
and
eat
your
egg
eaten
it
now
don
t
you
feel
efficient
what
more
do
you
want
comfort
you
say
my
dear
sir
more
men
have
been
ruined
by
comfort
great
heavens
comfort
the
most
dangerous
deadly
drug
that
ever
undermined
the
human
race
but
here
drink
your
water
now
you
re
ready
to
go
and
do
your
business
if
you
have
but
i
protested
it
s
still
only
seven
in
the
morning
no
offices
will
be
open
open
exclaimed
narrowpath
why
they
all
open
at
daybreak
i
had
it
is
true
a
certain
amount
of
business
before
me
though
of
no
very
intricate
or
elaborate
kind
a
few
simple
arrangements
with
the
head
of
a
publishing
house
such
as
it
falls
to
my
lot
to
make
every
now
and
then
yet
in
the
old
and
unregenerate
days
it
used
to
take
all
day
to
do
it
the
wicked
thing
that
we
used
to
call
a
comfortable
breakfast
in
the
hotel
grill
room
somehow
carried
one
on
to
about
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
breakfast
brought
with
it
the
need
of
a
cigar
for
digestion
s
sake
and
with
that
for
very
restfulness
a
certain
perusal
of
the
properly
corrected
and
rectified
by
a
look
through
the
after
that
it
had
been
my
practice
to
stroll
along
to
my
publishers
office
at
about
transact
my
business
over
a
cigar
with
the
genial
gentleman
at
the
head
of
it
and
then
accept
his
invitation
to
lunch
with
the
feeling
that
a
man
who
has
put
in
a
hard
and
strenuous
morning
s
work
is
entitled
to
a
few
hours
of
relaxation
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
those
reprehensible
bygone
times
many
other
people
did
their
business
in
this
same
way
i
don
t
think
i
said
to
narrowpath
musingly
that
my
publisher
will
be
up
as
early
as
this
he
s
a
comfortable
sort
of
nonsense
said
narrowpath
not
at
work
at
seven
in
toronto
the
thing
s
absurd
where
is
the
office
richmond
street
come
along
i
ll
go
with
you
i
ve
always
a
great
liking
for
attending
to
other
people
s
i
see
you
have
i
said
it
s
our
way
here
said
narrowpath
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
every
man
s
business
as
we
see
it
is
everybody
else
s
business
come
along
you
ll
be
surprised
how
quickly
your
business
will
be
narrowpath
was
right
my
publishers
office
as
we
entered
it
seemed
a
changed
place
activity
and
efficiency
were
stamped
all
over
it
my
good
friend
the
publisher
was
not
only
there
but
there
with
his
coat
off
inordinately
busy
bawling
orders
evidently
meant
for
a
printing
room
through
a
speaking
tube
yes
he
was
shouting
put
whisky
in
black
letter
capitals
old
english
double
size
set
it
up
to
look
attractive
with
the
legend
made
in
toronto
in
long
clear
type
underneath
excuse
me
he
said
as
he
broke
off
for
a
moment
we
ve
a
lot
of
stuff
going
through
the
press
this
morning
a
big
distillery
catalogue
that
we
are
rushing
through
we
re
doing
all
we
can
narrowpath
he
continued
speaking
with
the
deference
due
to
a
member
of
the
city
council
to
boom
toronto
as
a
whisky
quite
right
quite
right
said
my
companion
rubbing
his
hands
and
now
professor
added
the
publisher
speaking
with
rapidity
your
contract
is
all
here
only
needs
signing
i
won
t
keep
you
more
than
a
moment
write
your
name
here
miss
sniggins
will
you
please
witness
this
so
help
you
god
how
s
everything
in
montreal
good
pretty
quick
wasn
t
it
said
narrowpath
as
we
stood
in
the
street
again
wonderful
i
said
feeling
almost
dazed
why
i
shall
be
able
to
catch
the
morning
train
back
again
to
montreal
precisely
just
what
everybody
finds
business
done
in
no
time
men
who
used
to
spend
whole
days
here
clear
out
now
in
fifteen
minutes
i
knew
a
man
whose
business
efficiency
has
so
increased
under
our
new
regime
that
he
says
he
wouldn
t
spend
more
than
five
minutes
in
toronto
if
he
were
paid
but
what
is
this
i
asked
as
we
were
brought
to
a
pause
in
our
walk
at
a
street
crossing
by
a
great
block
of
vehicles
what
are
all
these
drays
surely
those
look
like
barrels
of
whisky
so
they
are
said
narrowpath
proudly
whisky
fine
sight
isn
t
it
must
be
what
twenty
loads
of
it
this
place
sir
mark
my
words
is
going
to
prove
with
its
new
energy
and
enterprise
one
of
the
greatest
seats
of
the
distillery
business
in
fact
whisky
capital
of
the
north
but
i
thought
i
interrupted
much
puzzled
that
whisky
was
prohibited
here
since
last
september
export
whisky
my
dear
sir
corrected
narrowpath
we
don
t
interfere
we
have
never
so
far
as
i
know
proposed
to
interfere
with
any
man
s
right
to
make
and
export
whisky
that
sir
is
a
plain
matter
of
business
morality
doesn
t
enter
into
i
see
i
answered
but
will
you
please
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
other
crowd
of
drays
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
surely
those
are
beer
barrels
are
they
not
in
a
sense
they
are
admitted
narrowpath
that
is
they
are
beer
it
comes
in
from
some
other
province
it
was
i
imagine
made
in
this
city
our
breweries
sir
are
second
to
none
but
the
sin
of
it
here
narrowpath
raised
his
hat
from
his
head
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
a
reverential
attitude
rests
on
the
heads
of
the
press
of
vehicles
had
now
thinned
out
and
we
moved
on
my
guide
still
explaining
in
some
detail
the
distinction
between
business
principles
and
moral
principles
between
whisky
as
a
curse
and
whisky
as
a
source
of
profit
which
i
found
myself
unable
to
comprehend
at
length
i
ventured
to
interrupt
yet
it
seems
almost
a
pity
i
said
that
with
all
this
beer
and
whisky
around
an
unregenerate
sinner
like
myself
should
be
prohibited
from
getting
a
a
drink
exclaimed
narrowpath
well
i
should
say
so
come
right
in
here
you
can
have
anything
you
we
stepped
through
a
street
door
into
a
large
long
room
why
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
this
is
a
bar
nonsense
said
my
friend
the
in
this
province
is
forbidden
we
ve
done
with
the
foul
thing
for
ever
this
is
an
import
shipping
company
s
delivery
but
this
long
counter
it
s
not
a
counter
it
s
a
and
that
in
his
white
jacket
tut
tut
he
s
not
a
he
s
an
import
goods
delivery
what
ll
you
have
gentlemen
said
the
import
clerk
polishing
a
glass
as
he
spoke
two
whisky
and
sodas
said
my
friend
long
the
import
clerk
mixed
the
drinks
and
set
them
on
the
desk
i
was
about
to
take
one
but
he
interrupted
one
minute
sir
he
said
then
he
took
up
a
desk
telephone
that
stood
beside
him
and
i
heard
him
calling
up
montreal
hullo
montreal
is
that
montreal
well
say
i
ve
just
received
an
offer
here
for
two
whisky
and
sodas
at
sixty
cents
shall
i
close
with
it
all
right
gentlemen
montreal
has
effected
the
sale
there
you
dreadful
isn
t
it
said
narrowpath
the
sunken
depraved
condition
of
your
city
of
montreal
actually
whisky
deplorable
and
with
that
he
buried
his
face
in
the
bubbles
of
the
whisky
and
soda
mr
narrowpath
i
said
would
you
mind
telling
me
something
i
fear
i
am
a
little
confused
after
what
i
have
seen
here
as
to
what
your
new
legislation
has
been
you
have
not
then
i
understand
prohibited
the
making
of
whisky
oh
no
we
see
no
harm
in
nor
the
sale
of
it
certainly
not
said
narrowpath
not
if
sold
nor
the
drinking
of
it
oh
no
that
least
of
all
we
attach
no
harm
whatever
under
our
law
to
the
mere
drinking
of
would
you
tell
me
then
i
asked
since
you
have
not
forbidden
the
making
nor
the
selling
nor
the
buying
nor
the
drinking
of
whisky
just
what
it
is
that
you
have
prohibited
what
is
the
difference
between
montreal
and
toronto
narrowpath
put
down
his
glass
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
he
gazed
at
me
with
astonishment
toronto
he
gasped
montreal
and
toronto
the
difference
between
montreal
and
toronto
my
dear
sir
toronto
toronto
i
stood
waiting
for
him
to
explain
but
as
i
did
so
i
seemed
to
become
aware
that
a
voice
not
narrowpath
s
but
a
voice
close
at
my
ear
was
repeating
toronto
toronto
toronto
i
sat
up
with
a
start
still
in
my
berth
in
the
pullman
car
with
the
voice
of
the
porter
calling
through
the
curtains
toronto
toronto
so
it
had
only
been
a
dream
i
pulled
up
the
blind
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
there
was
the
good
old
city
with
the
bright
sun
sparkling
on
its
church
spires
and
on
the
bay
spread
out
at
its
feet
it
looked
quite
unchanged
just
the
same
pleasant
old
place
as
cheerful
as
as
kindly
as
hospitable
as
quarrelsome
as
wholesome
as
moral
and
as
loyal
and
as
disagreeable
as
it
always
was
porter
i
said
is
it
true
that
there
is
prohibition
here
now
the
porter
shook
his
head
i
ain
t
heard
of
it
he
said
xviii
merry
christmas
my
dear
young
friend
said
father
time
as
he
laid
his
hand
gently
upon
my
shoulder
you
are
entirely
then
i
looked
up
over
my
shoulder
from
the
table
at
which
i
was
sitting
and
i
saw
him
but
i
had
known
or
felt
for
at
least
the
last
that
he
was
standing
somewhere
near
me
you
have
had
i
do
not
doubt
good
reader
more
than
once
that
strange
uncanny
feeling
that
there
is
some
one
unseen
standing
beside
you
in
a
darkened
room
let
us
say
with
a
dying
fire
when
the
night
has
grown
late
and
the
october
wind
sounds
low
outside
and
when
through
the
thin
curtain
that
we
call
reality
the
unseen
world
starts
for
a
moment
clear
upon
our
dreaming
sense
you
had
it
yes
i
know
you
have
never
mind
telling
me
about
it
stop
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
that
strange
presentiment
you
had
the
night
your
aunt
eliza
broke
her
leg
don
t
let
s
bother
with
experience
i
want
to
tell
mine
you
are
quite
mistaken
my
dear
young
friend
repeated
father
time
quite
friend
i
said
my
mind
as
one
s
mind
is
apt
to
in
such
a
case
running
to
an
unimportant
detail
why
do
you
call
me
young
your
pardon
he
answered
gently
he
had
a
gentle
way
with
him
had
father
time
the
fault
is
in
my
failing
eyes
i
took
you
at
first
sight
for
something
under
a
under
a
hundred
i
expostulated
well
i
should
think
so
your
pardon
again
said
time
the
fault
is
in
my
failing
memory
i
forgot
you
seldom
pass
that
nowadays
do
you
your
life
is
very
short
of
i
heard
him
breathe
a
wistful
hollow
sigh
very
ancient
and
dim
he
seemed
as
he
stood
beside
me
but
i
did
not
turn
to
look
upon
him
i
had
no
need
to
i
knew
his
form
in
the
inner
and
clearer
sight
of
things
as
well
as
every
human
being
knows
by
innate
instinct
the
unseen
face
and
form
of
father
time
i
could
hear
him
murmuring
beside
me
short
short
your
life
is
short
till
the
sound
of
it
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
measured
ticking
of
a
clock
somewhere
in
the
silent
house
then
i
remembered
what
he
had
said
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
wrong
i
asked
and
how
can
you
tell
what
i
was
thinking
you
said
it
out
loud
answered
father
time
but
it
wouldn
t
have
mattered
anyway
you
said
that
christmas
was
all
played
out
and
done
yes
i
admitted
that
s
what
i
and
what
makes
you
think
that
he
questioned
stooping
so
it
seemed
to
me
still
further
over
my
shoulder
why
i
answered
the
trouble
is
this
i
ve
been
sitting
here
for
hours
sitting
till
goodness
only
knows
how
far
into
the
night
trying
to
think
out
something
to
write
for
a
christmas
story
and
it
won
t
go
it
can
t
be
done
not
in
these
awful
a
christmas
story
yes
you
see
father
time
i
explained
glad
with
a
foolish
little
vanity
of
my
trade
to
be
able
to
tell
him
something
that
i
thought
enlightening
all
the
christmas
stuff
stories
and
jokes
and
pictures
is
all
done
you
know
in
i
thought
it
would
have
surprised
him
but
i
was
mistaken
dear
me
he
said
not
till
october
what
a
rush
how
well
i
remember
in
ancient
egypt
as
i
think
you
call
it
seeing
them
getting
out
their
christmas
things
all
cut
in
hieroglyphics
always
two
or
three
years
two
or
three
years
i
exclaimed
pooh
said
time
that
was
nothing
why
in
babylon
they
used
to
get
their
christmas
jokes
ready
all
baked
in
clay
a
whole
solar
eclipse
ahead
of
christmas
they
said
i
think
that
the
public
preferred
them
egypt
i
said
babylon
but
surely
father
time
there
was
no
christmas
in
those
days
i
thought
my
dear
boy
he
interrupted
gravely
don
t
you
know
that
there
has
always
been
christmas
i
was
silent
father
time
had
moved
across
the
room
and
stood
beside
the
fireplace
leaning
on
the
mantelpiece
the
little
wreaths
of
smoke
from
the
fading
fire
seemed
to
mingle
with
his
shadowy
outline
well
he
said
presently
what
is
it
that
is
wrong
with
christmas
why
i
answered
all
the
romance
the
joy
the
beauty
of
it
has
gone
crushed
and
killed
by
the
greed
of
commerce
and
the
horrors
of
war
i
am
not
as
you
thought
i
was
a
hundred
years
old
but
i
can
conjure
up
as
anybody
can
a
picture
of
christmas
in
the
good
old
days
of
a
hundred
years
ago
the
quaint
houses
standing
deep
among
the
evergreens
with
the
light
twinkling
from
the
windows
on
the
snow
the
warmth
and
comfort
within
the
great
fire
roaring
on
the
hearth
the
merry
guests
grouped
about
its
blaze
and
the
little
children
with
their
eyes
dancing
in
the
christmas
waiting
for
father
christmas
in
his
fine
mummery
of
red
and
white
and
cotton
wool
to
hand
the
presents
from
the
tree
i
can
see
it
i
added
as
if
it
were
it
was
but
yesterday
said
father
time
and
his
voice
seemed
to
soften
with
the
memory
of
bygone
years
i
remember
it
ah
i
continued
that
was
christmas
indeed
give
me
back
such
days
as
those
with
the
old
good
cheer
the
old
stage
coaches
and
the
gabled
inns
and
the
warm
red
wine
the
snapdragon
and
the
and
i
ll
believe
again
in
christmas
yes
in
father
christmas
believe
in
him
said
time
quietly
you
may
well
do
that
he
happens
to
be
standing
outside
in
the
street
at
this
outside
i
exclaimed
why
don
t
he
come
in
he
s
afraid
to
said
father
time
he
s
frightened
and
he
daren
t
come
in
unless
you
ask
him
may
i
call
him
in
i
signified
assent
and
father
time
went
to
the
window
for
a
moment
and
beckoned
into
the
darkened
street
then
i
heard
footsteps
clumsy
and
hesitant
they
seemed
upon
the
stairs
and
in
a
moment
a
figure
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
the
figure
of
father
christmas
he
stood
shuffling
his
feet
a
timid
apologetic
look
upon
his
face
how
changed
he
was
i
had
known
in
my
mind
s
eye
from
childhood
up
the
face
and
form
of
father
christmas
as
well
as
that
of
old
time
himself
everybody
knows
or
once
knew
him
a
jolly
little
rounded
man
with
a
great
muffler
wound
about
him
a
packet
of
toys
upon
his
back
and
with
such
merry
twinkling
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
as
are
only
given
by
the
touch
of
the
driving
snow
and
the
rude
fun
of
the
north
wind
why
there
was
once
a
time
not
yet
so
long
ago
when
the
very
sound
of
his
sent
the
blood
running
warm
to
the
heart
but
now
how
changed
all
draggled
with
the
mud
and
rain
he
stood
as
if
no
house
had
sheltered
him
these
three
years
past
his
old
red
jersey
was
tattered
in
a
dozen
places
his
muffler
frayed
and
ravelled
the
bundle
of
toys
that
he
dragged
with
him
in
a
net
seemed
wet
and
worn
till
the
cardboard
boxes
gaped
asunder
there
were
boxes
among
them
i
vow
that
he
must
have
been
carrying
these
three
past
years
but
most
of
all
i
noted
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
face
of
father
christmas
the
old
brave
look
of
cheery
confidence
was
gone
the
smile
that
had
beamed
responsive
to
the
laughing
eyes
of
countless
children
around
unnumbered
was
there
no
more
and
in
the
place
of
it
there
showed
a
look
of
timid
apology
of
apprehensiveness
as
of
one
who
has
asked
in
vain
the
warmth
and
shelter
of
a
human
home
such
a
look
as
the
harsh
cruelty
of
this
world
has
stamped
upon
the
faces
of
its
outcasts
so
stood
father
christmas
shuffling
upon
the
threshold
fumbling
his
poor
tattered
hat
in
his
hand
shall
i
come
in
he
said
his
eyes
appealingly
on
father
time
come
said
time
he
turned
to
speak
to
me
your
room
is
dark
turn
up
the
lights
he
s
used
to
light
bright
light
and
plenty
of
it
the
dark
has
frightened
him
these
three
years
i
turned
up
the
lights
and
the
bright
glare
revealed
all
the
more
cruelly
the
tattered
figure
before
us
father
christmas
advanced
a
timid
step
across
the
floor
then
he
paused
as
if
in
sudden
fear
is
this
floor
mined
he
said
no
no
said
time
soothingly
and
to
me
he
added
in
a
murmured
whisper
he
s
afraid
he
was
blown
up
in
a
mine
in
no
man
s
land
between
the
trenches
at
in
it
broke
his
may
i
put
my
toys
on
that
machine
gun
asked
father
christmas
timidly
it
will
help
to
keep
them
it
is
not
a
machine
gun
said
time
gently
see
it
is
only
a
pile
of
books
upon
the
and
to
me
he
whispered
they
turned
a
machine
gun
on
him
in
the
streets
of
warsaw
he
thinks
he
sees
them
everywhere
since
it
s
all
right
father
christmas
i
said
speaking
as
cheerily
as
i
could
while
i
rose
and
stirred
the
fire
into
a
blaze
there
are
no
machine
guns
here
and
there
are
no
mines
this
is
but
the
house
of
a
poor
ah
said
father
christmas
lowering
his
tattered
hat
still
further
and
attempting
something
of
a
humble
bow
a
writer
are
you
hans
andersen
perhaps
not
quite
i
answered
but
a
great
writer
i
do
not
doubt
said
the
old
man
with
a
humble
courtesy
that
he
had
learned
it
well
may
be
centuries
ago
in
the
season
of
his
northern
home
the
world
owes
much
to
its
great
books
i
carry
some
of
the
greatest
with
me
always
i
have
them
here
he
began
fumbling
among
the
limp
and
tattered
packages
that
he
carried
look
house
that
jack
a
marvellous
deep
thing
sir
and
this
babes
in
the
will
you
take
it
sir
a
poor
present
but
a
present
still
not
so
long
ago
i
gave
them
in
thousands
every
none
seem
to
want
them
he
looked
appealingly
towards
father
time
as
the
weak
may
look
towards
the
strong
for
help
and
guidance
none
want
them
now
he
repeated
and
i
could
see
the
tears
start
in
his
eyes
why
is
it
so
has
the
world
forgotten
its
sympathy
with
the
lost
children
wandering
in
the
wood
all
the
world
i
heard
time
murmur
with
a
sigh
is
wandering
in
the
but
out
loud
he
spoke
to
father
christmas
in
cheery
admonition
tut
tut
good
christmas
he
said
you
must
cheer
up
here
sit
in
this
chair
the
biggest
one
so
beside
the
fire
let
us
stir
it
to
a
blaze
more
wood
that
s
better
and
listen
good
old
friend
to
the
wind
outside
almost
a
christmas
wind
is
it
not
merry
and
boisterous
enough
for
all
the
evil
times
it
stirs
old
christmas
seated
himself
beside
the
fire
his
hands
outstretched
towards
the
flames
something
of
his
cheeriness
seemed
to
flicker
across
his
features
as
he
warmed
himself
at
the
blaze
that
s
better
he
murmured
i
was
cold
sir
cold
chilled
to
the
bone
of
old
i
never
felt
it
so
no
matter
what
the
wind
the
world
seemed
warm
about
me
why
is
it
not
so
now
you
see
said
time
speaking
low
in
a
whisper
for
my
ear
alone
how
sunk
and
broken
he
is
will
you
not
help
gladly
i
answered
if
i
all
can
said
father
time
every
one
of
meantime
christmas
had
turned
towards
me
a
questioning
eye
in
which
however
there
seemed
to
revive
some
little
gleam
of
merriment
have
you
perhaps
he
asked
half
timidly
schnapps
schnapps
i
repeated
ay
schnapps
a
glass
of
it
to
drink
your
health
might
warm
my
heart
again
i
ah
i
said
something
to
drink
his
one
failing
whispered
time
if
it
is
one
forgive
it
him
he
was
used
to
it
for
centuries
give
it
him
if
you
have
i
keep
a
little
in
the
house
i
said
reluctantly
perhaps
in
case
of
tut
tut
said
father
time
as
something
as
near
as
could
be
to
a
smile
passed
over
his
shadowy
face
in
case
of
illness
they
used
to
say
that
in
ancient
babylon
here
let
me
pour
it
for
him
drink
father
christmas
drink
marvellous
it
was
to
see
the
old
man
smack
his
lips
as
he
drank
his
glass
of
liquor
neat
after
the
fashion
of
old
norway
marvellous
too
to
see
the
way
in
which
with
the
warmth
of
the
fire
and
the
generous
glow
of
the
spirits
his
face
changed
and
brightened
till
the
cheerfulness
beamed
again
upon
it
he
looked
about
him
as
it
were
with
a
new
and
growing
interest
a
pleasant
room
he
said
and
what
better
sir
than
the
wind
without
and
a
brave
fire
within
then
his
eye
fell
upon
the
mantelpiece
where
lay
among
the
litter
of
books
and
pipes
a
little
toy
horse
ah
said
father
christmas
almost
gayly
children
in
the
house
one
i
answered
the
sweetest
boy
in
all
the
i
ll
be
bound
he
is
said
father
christmas
and
he
broke
now
into
a
merry
laugh
that
did
one
s
heart
good
to
hear
they
all
are
lord
bless
me
the
number
that
i
have
seen
and
each
and
every
one
and
quite
right
too
the
sweetest
child
in
all
the
world
and
how
old
do
you
say
two
and
a
half
all
but
two
months
except
a
week
the
very
sweetest
age
of
all
i
ll
bet
you
say
eh
what
they
all
do
and
the
old
man
broke
again
into
such
a
jolly
chuckling
of
laughter
that
his
locks
shook
upon
his
head
but
stop
a
bit
he
added
this
horse
is
broken
tut
tut
a
hind
leg
nearly
off
this
won
t
do
he
had
the
toy
in
his
lap
in
a
moment
mending
it
it
was
wonderful
to
see
for
all
his
age
how
deft
his
fingers
were
time
he
said
and
it
was
amusing
to
note
that
his
voice
had
assumed
almost
an
authoritative
tone
reach
me
that
piece
of
string
that
s
right
here
hold
your
finger
across
the
knot
there
now
then
a
bit
of
beeswax
what
no
beeswax
tut
tut
how
your
houses
are
how
can
you
mend
toys
sir
without
beeswax
still
it
will
stand
up
i
tried
to
murmur
by
best
thanks
but
father
christmas
waved
my
gratitude
aside
nonsense
he
said
that
s
nothing
that
s
my
life
perhaps
the
little
boy
would
like
a
book
too
i
have
them
here
in
the
packet
here
sir
and
the
bean
most
profound
thing
i
read
it
to
myself
often
still
how
damp
it
is
pray
sir
will
you
let
me
dry
my
books
before
your
fire
only
too
willingly
i
said
how
wet
and
torn
they
are
father
christmas
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
fumbling
among
his
tattered
packages
taking
from
them
his
children
s
books
all
limp
and
draggled
from
the
rain
and
wind
all
wet
and
torn
he
murmured
and
his
voice
sank
again
into
sadness
i
have
carried
them
these
three
years
past
look
these
were
for
little
children
in
belgium
and
in
serbia
can
i
get
them
to
them
think
you
time
gently
shook
his
head
but
presently
perhaps
said
father
christmas
if
i
dry
and
mend
them
look
some
of
them
were
inscribed
already
this
one
see
you
was
written
father
s
why
has
it
never
come
to
him
is
it
rain
or
tears
upon
the
page
he
stood
bowed
over
his
little
books
his
hands
trembling
as
he
turned
the
pages
then
he
looked
up
the
old
fear
upon
his
face
again
that
sound
he
said
listen
it
is
guns
i
hear
no
no
i
said
it
is
nothing
only
a
car
passing
in
the
street
listen
he
said
hear
that
again
voices
crying
no
no
i
answered
not
voices
only
the
night
wind
among
the
my
children
s
voices
he
exclaimed
i
hear
them
everywhere
they
come
to
me
in
every
wind
and
i
see
them
as
i
wander
in
the
night
and
storm
my
children
torn
and
dying
in
the
trenches
beaten
into
the
ground
i
hear
them
crying
from
the
hospitals
each
one
to
me
still
as
i
knew
him
once
a
little
child
time
time
he
cried
reaching
out
his
arms
in
appeal
give
me
back
my
children
they
do
not
die
in
vain
time
murmured
gently
but
christmas
only
moaned
in
answer
give
me
back
my
children
then
he
sank
down
upon
his
pile
of
books
and
toys
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
you
see
said
time
his
heart
is
breaking
and
will
you
not
help
him
if
you
can
only
too
gladly
i
replied
but
what
is
there
to
do
this
said
father
time
he
stood
before
me
grave
and
solemn
a
shadowy
figure
but
half
seen
though
he
was
close
beside
me
the
had
died
down
and
through
the
curtained
windows
there
came
already
the
first
dim
brightening
of
dawn
the
world
that
once
you
knew
said
father
time
seems
broken
and
destroyed
about
you
you
must
not
let
them
know
the
children
the
cruelty
and
the
horror
and
the
hate
that
racks
the
world
keep
it
from
them
some
day
will
know
here
time
pointed
to
the
prostrate
form
of
father
christmas
that
his
children
that
once
were
have
not
died
in
vain
that
from
their
sacrifice
shall
come
a
nobler
better
world
for
all
to
live
in
a
world
where
countless
happy
children
shall
hold
bright
their
memory
for
ever
but
for
the
children
of
save
and
spare
them
all
you
can
from
the
evil
hate
and
horror
of
the
war
later
they
will
know
and
understand
not
yet
give
them
back
their
merry
christmas
and
its
kind
thoughts
and
its
christmas
charity
till
later
on
there
shall
be
with
it
again
peace
upon
earth
good
will
towards
his
voice
ceased
it
seemed
to
vanish
as
it
were
in
the
sighing
of
the
wind
i
looked
up
father
time
and
christmas
had
vanished
from
the
room
the
fire
was
low
and
the
day
was
breaking
visibly
outside
let
us
begin
i
murmured
i
will
mend
this
broken
end
