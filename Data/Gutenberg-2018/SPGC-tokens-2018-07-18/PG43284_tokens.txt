introduction
had
jesting
pilate
asked
what
is
art
he
would
have
waited
quite
as
many
centuries
for
an
answer
as
he
has
for
the
answer
to
his
question
about
truth
for
art
to
the
artist
and
art
to
the
rest
of
us
are
two
very
different
things
art
to
the
artist
is
quite
simply
life
his
life
of
which
he
has
an
amplitude
and
intensity
unknown
to
us
what
he
does
for
us
is
to
thrill
us
awake
to
the
amplitude
and
intensity
of
all
life
our
own
included
and
this
is
a
miracle
for
which
we
can
never
be
thankful
enough
this
at
least
is
what
rockwell
kent
alaska
drawings
and
alaska
journal
do
for
me
they
take
me
away
from
that
tired
absorption
in
things
of
little
import
which
makes
up
most
of
our
human
life
and
make
me
see
not
an
unreal
world
of
romantic
illusion
that
fool
pleasure
given
by
the
artist
but
the
real
in
which
i
live
and
have
always
lived
they
make
me
see
suddenly
that
there
is
a
vast
deal
more
in
the
world
than
embittering
and
anxious
preoccupations
that
much
of
it
is
fine
much
is
comforting
much
much
profoundly
tragic
and
all
of
it
makes
up
a
whole
so
vast
that
no
living
organism
need
feel
cramped
no
other
of
the
qualities
of
the
journal
and
drawings
goes
home
to
me
more
than
the
unforced
authenticity
of
the
impression
set
down
by
this
strong
and
ardent
artist
emerson
grandeur
is
infinitely
more
convincing
to
me
because
of
his
homeliness
and
i
feel
a
perverse
yankee
suspicion
of
those
who
deal
in
sublimities
only
the
man
who
can
extract
the
whole
quaint
savor
out
of
that
magical
prosaic
humorous
moment
of
human
life
the
first
stretching
yawn
of
the
early
morning
that
man
can
make
me
believe
that
i
too
see
the
north
wind
running
mightily
athwart
the
sky
and
the
artist
who
can
put
into
the
simplest
drawing
of
a
man
and
a
little
boy
eating
together
at
a
rough
table
in
a
rough
cabin
all
the
dear
solidity
of
family
and
home
life
with
its
quiet
triumph
against
overpowering
nature
that
artist
can
make
me
bow
my
head
before
the
sincerity
of
his
impressive
night
the
homeliness
of
the
diary
its
courageously
unaffected
naturalness
how
it
carries
one
out
of
fussy
complications
to
a
long
breath
of
relief
in
the
fewness
and
permanence
of
things
that
count
and
the
humor
of
it
sometimes
deliciously
unintentional
like
the
picture
of
the
artist
finishing
a
fine
drawing
setting
the
beans
to
soak
bathing
in
the
bread
pan
and
going
to
bed
to
read
a
chapter
of
blake
sometimes
intentional
and
shrewd
like
a
on
a
tames
that
wilderness
or
colds
like
bad
temper
and
loss
of
faith
are
a
malady
of
the
city
crowd
sometimes
outright
and
hearty
like
a
child
joke
as
in
the
amusingly
faithful
portrait
of
the
personality
of
the
stove
there
are
only
three
human
characters
in
this
quiet
intense
record
all
of
them
significant
and
vital
first
of
them
is
the
artist
himself
who
in
these
notes
written
originally
for
the
eyes
of
his
intimates
only
speaks
out
with
a
free
unselfconsciousness
as
rare
in
our
modern
world
as
the
virgin
solitude
of
the
island
where
he
lived
here
is
the
artist
at
work
creating
as
henry
james
said
he
could
not
be
shown
the
artist
that
is
a
man
violently
alive
and
fine
fierce
and
pure
arrogant
and
tender
with
an
elate
boastful
certainty
of
his
strength
rejoicing
in
his
work
in
his
son
in
his
friend
in
the
whole
visible
world
and
most
of
all
in
himself
and
his
own
vigorous
possibilities
for
good
evil
and
creative
work
the
other
two
human
characters
in
this
adventuring
quest
after
great
and
simple
things
are
acquisitions
to
be
thankful
for
also
the
touchingly
beautiful
funny
little
boy
and
lovable
dignified
old
olson
a
fiction
writer
wonders
in
despair
why
old
olson
so
vividly
brilliantly
lives
in
these
unstudied
pages
solid
breathing
warm
as
miraculously
different
from
all
other
human
beings
as
any
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
who
draws
the
mysterious
breath
of
life
beside
you
in
the
same
room
fox
island
lives
too
we
walk
about
it
treading
solidly
loving
every
log
and
rotten
stump
gnarled
tree
every
mound
and
path
the
rocks
and
brooks
each
a
being
in
itself
just
as
little
rockwell
does
and
we
climb
with
the
two
younger
ones
up
the
sheer
ridge
till
across
the
great
jagged
teeth
of
we
see
the
glory
of
the
open
sea
we
look
up
at
olson
swaying
gigantic
on
the
deck
above
us
as
we
bump
the
side
in
our
little
boat
and
we
go
down
into
the
warm
cabin
full
of
the
fumes
of
cooking
and
and
drink
with
the
old
skipper
and
the
old
swede
till
we
too
see
deep
under
the
white
hard
surface
of
where
life
is
hidden
all
this
firm
earth
gives
authority
and
penetration
to
the
shining
beauty
which
pervades
the
book
and
the
drawings
carries
us
along
to
share
it
not
merely
to
look
at
it
to
feel
it
not
merely
to
admire
it
the
notes
here
published
were
written
i
believe
day
by
day
for
the
author
wife
and
children
and
are
here
published
almost
as
they
were
set
down
as
commentary
to
the
drawings
well
let
us
be
thankful
that
we
were
let
into
the
family
circle
and
along
with
them
can
spend
six
months
in
the
midst
of
strength
and
beauty
and
tenderness
and
fun
and
majesty
close
to
simple
things
great
because
they
are
real
the
author
may
be
sure
that
we
leave
them
with
the
same
wistfulness
he
feels
and
with
the
same
gratitude
for
having
known
them
dorothy
canfield
preface
most
of
this
book
was
written
on
fox
island
in
alaska
a
journal
added
to
from
day
to
day
it
was
not
meant
for
publication
but
merely
that
we
who
were
living
there
that
year
might
have
always
an
unfailing
memory
of
a
wonderfully
happy
time
there
a
ring
of
truth
to
all
freshly
written
records
of
experience
that
whatever
their
shortcomings
makes
them
at
least
inviolable
besides
the
journal
a
few
letters
to
friends
have
been
drawn
upon
all
are
given
unchanged
but
for
the
flux
of
a
new
paragraph
or
chapter
here
and
there
to
form
a
kind
of
narrative
the
only
possible
literary
accompaniment
to
the
drawings
of
that
period
herein
published
the
whole
is
a
picture
of
quiet
adventure
in
the
wilderness
above
all
an
adventure
of
the
spirit
what
one
would
look
for
in
a
story
of
the
wild
northwest
is
lacking
in
these
pages
to
have
been
further
from
a
settled
town
might
have
brought
not
more
but
less
excitement
the
wonder
of
the
wilderness
was
its
tranquillity
it
seemed
that
there
both
men
and
the
wild
beasts
pursued
their
own
paths
freely
and
as
if
conscious
of
the
wide
freedom
of
their
world
molested
one
another
not
at
all
it
was
the
bitter
philosophy
of
the
old
trapper
who
was
our
companion
that
of
all
animals
man
was
the
most
terrible
for
if
the
beasts
fought
and
killed
for
some
good
cause
man
slew
for
none
deliberately
i
have
begun
this
happy
story
far
out
in

and
again
dropped
its
peaceful
thread
on
the
forlorn
threshold
of
the
town

discovery
we
must
have
been
rowing
for
an
hour
across
that
seeming
stretch
of
water
the
air
is
so
clear
in
the
north
that
one
new
to
it
is
lost
in
the
crowding
of
great
heights
and
spaces
distant
peaks
had
risen
over
the
lower
mountains
of
the
shore
astern
steep
slopes
confronted
us
all
around
was
the
wilderness
a
of
mountains
or
of
cragged
islands
and
southward
the
wide
the
limitless
pacific
ocean
a
calm
blue
summer
day
and
on
we
rowed
upon
our
search
somewhere
there
must
stand
awaiting
us
as
we
had
pictured
it
a
little
forgotten
cabin
one
that
some
prospector
or
fisherman
had
built
the
cabin
the
grove
the
sheltered
beach
the
spring
or
stream
of
fresh
cold
water
we
could
have
drawn
it
even
to
the
view
that
it
must
overlook
the
sea
and
mountains
and
the
glorious
west
we
came
to
this
new
land
a
boy
and
a
man
entirely
on
a
dreamer
search
having
had
vision
of
a
northern
paradise
we
came
to
find
it
with
less
faith
it
might
have
seemed
to
us
a
hopeless
thing
exploring
the
unknown
for
what
you
only
dreamed
was
there
doubt
never
crossed
our
minds
to
sail
uncharted
waters
and
follow
virgin
shores
what
a
life
for
men
as
the
new
coast
unfolds
itself
the
imagination
leaps
into
full
vision
of
the
human
drama
that
there
is
immanent
the
grandeur
of
the
ocean
cliff
is
terrible
with
threat
of
shipwreck
to
that
high
ledge
the
wave
may
lift
you
there
where
that
spruce
has
found
a
hold
for
half
a
century
you
perhaps
could
cling
a
hundred
times
a
day
you
think
of
death
or
of
escaping
it
by
might
and
courage
then
at
the
first
softening
of
the
coast
toward
a
cove
or
inlet
you
imagine
all
the
mild
beauties
of
a
safe
harbor
the
quiet
water
and
the
beach
to
land
upon
the
a
homestead
of
your
own
cleared
land
and
pastures
that
look
seaward
now
having
crossed
the
bay
thick
wooded
coast
confronted
us
and
we
worked
eastward
toward
a
inlet
of
that
shore
but
all
at
once
there
appeared
as
if
from
nowhere
a
little
dory
coming
toward
us
we
hailed
and
drew
together
to
converse
it
was
an
old
man
alone
we
told
him
frankly
what
we
were
and
what
we
sought
come
with
me
he
cried
heartily
come
and
i
show
you
the
place
to
live
and
he
pointed
oceanward
where
straight
in
the
path
of
the
sun
stood
the
huge
dark
mountain
mass
of
an
island
then
seizing
upon
our
line
he
towed
us
with
him
to
the
south
the
gentle
breeze
came
up
with
prow
high
in
the
air
we
spanked
the
wavelets
and
the
glistening
spray
flew
over
us
on
we
went
straight
at
the
dazzling
sun
and
we
laughed
to
think
that
we
were
being
carried
we
knew
not
where
and
all
the
while
the
strange
old
man
spoke
never
a
word
nor
turned
his
head
driving
us
on
as
if
he
feared
we
might
demand
to
be
unloosed
at
last
his
island
towered
above
us
it
was
truly
and
immense
and
for
all
we
could
discover
harborless
till
in
a
moment
rounding
the
great
headland
of
its
northern
end
the
crescent
arms
of
the
harbor
were
about
us
and
we
were
there
illustration
zarathustra
himself
led
the
ugliest
man
by
the
hand
in
order
to
show
him
his
and
the
great
round
moon
and
the
silvery
waterfalls
nigh
unto
his
cave
what
a
scene
twin
lofty
mountain
masses
flanked
the
entrance
and
from
the
back
of
these
the
land
dipped
downwards
like
a
hammock
swung
between
them
its
lowest
point
behind
the
center
of
the
crescent
a
clean
and
smooth
beach
went
all
around
the
bay
the
tide
line
marked
with
driftwood
gleaming
bleached
bones
of
trees
fantastic
roots
and
worn
and
shredded
trunks
above
the
beach
a
band
of
brilliant
green
and
then
the
deep
black
spaces
of
the
forest
so
huge
was
the
scale
of
all
of
this
that
for
some
time
we
looked
in
vain
for
any
habitation
at
last
incredulously
seeing
what
we
had
taken
to
be
bowlders
assume
the
form
of
cabins
the
dories
grounded
and
we
leapt
ashore
and
followed
up
the
beach
onto
the
level
ground
seeing
and
wondering
with
beating
hearts
and
crying
all
the
time
to
ourselves
it
is
possible
it
is
real
there
was
a
green
grass
lawn
beneath
our
feet
extending
on
one
side
under
an
orchard
of
neatly
pruned
alders
to
the
mountain
base
and
on
the
other
into
the
forest
or
along
the
shore
in
the
midst
of
the
clearing
stood
the
old
man
cabin
he
led
us
into
it
one
little
room
neat
and
comfortable
two
windows
south
and
west
with
the
warm
sun
streaming
through
them
a
stove
a
table
by
the
window
with
dishes
piled
neatly
on
it
some
shelves
of
food
and
one
of
books
and
papers
a
bunk
with
gaily
striped
blankets
boots
guns
tools
a
ladder
to
the
in
the
loft
and
the
old
man
himself
a
swede
short
round
and
sturdy
head
bald
as
though
with
a
priestly
tonsure
high
cheek
bones
and
broad
face
full
lips
a
sensitive
small
chin
and
his
little
eyes
sparkled
with
good
humor
look
this
is
all
mine
he
was
saying
you
can
live
here
with
me
with
me
and
nanny
for
by
this
time
not
only
had
the
milk
goat
nanny
entered
but
a
whole
family
of
angoras
father
mother
and
child
nosing
among
us
or
overturning
what
they
could
in
search
of
food
he
took
us
to
the
fox
corral
a
few
yards
from
the
house
there
were
the
blues
in
its
far
corner
eying
us
askance
we
saw
the
old
goat
cabin
built
of
logs
and
were
told
of
a
newer
one
an
unused
one
down
the
shore
and
deeper
in
the
woods
but
come
he
said
with
pride
i
show
you
my
location
notice
i
have
done
it
all
in
the
proper
way
and
i
will
get
my
title
from
washington
soon
i
have
staked
fifty
acres
it
is
all
described
in
the
notice
i
have
posted
and
i
would
like
to
see
anybody
get
that
away
from
me
by
now
we
had
reached
the
great
spruce
tree
to
whose
trunk
he
had
affixed
a
sort
of
roofed
tablet
or
shrine
to
house
the
precious
document
but
ah
look
the
tablet
was
bare
only
that
from
a
small
nail
in
it
hung
a
torn
shred
of
paper
billy
nanny
roared
the
old
man
in
irritation
and
mock
rage
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
foolish
looking
culprits
who
regarded
us
this
time
wisely
from
a
distance
and
now
come
to
the
lake
we
went
down
an
avenue
through
the
tall
spruce
trees
the
sun
flecked
our
path
and
fired
here
and
there
a
mushroom
that
blazed
in
the
forest
gloom
right
and
left
we
saw
deep
vistas
and
straight
ahead
a
broad
and
sunlit
space
a
valley
between
hills
there
lay
the
lake
it
was
a
real
lake
broad
and
clean
of
many
acres
in
extent
and
the
whole
mountain
side
lay
mirrored
in
it
with
the
purple
zenith
sky
at
our
feet
not
a
breath
disturbed
the
surface
not
a
ripple
broke
along
the
pebbly
beach
it
was
dead
silent
here
but
for
maybe
the
far
off
sound
of
surf
and
without
motion
but
that
high
aloft
two
eagles
soared
with
steady
wing
searching
the
mountain
tops
ah
supreme
moment
these
are
the
times
in
life
when
nothing
happens
but
in
quietness
the
soul
expands
time
pressed
and
we
turned
back
show
us
that
other
cabin
we
must
go
the
old
man
took
us
by
a
short
cut
to
the
cabin
he
had
spoken
of
it
stood
in
a
darkly
shadowed
clearing
a
log
cabin
of
ample
size
with
a
small
doorway
that
you
stooped
to
enter
inside
was
dark
but
for
a
little
opening
to
the
west
there
were
the
stalls
for
goats
coops
for
some
belgian
hares
he
had
once
kept
a
tin
whirligig
for
squirrels
hanging
in
the
gable
peak
and
under
foot
a
shaky
floor
covered
with
filth
illustration
unknown
waters
but
i
knew
what
that
cabin
might
become
i
saw
it
once
and
said
this
is
the
place
we
live
and
then
returning
to
our
boat
we
shook
hands
on
this
great
quick
finding
of
the
thing
we
sought
and
since
we
could
not
stay
then
as
he
begged
us
to
promised
a
speedy
return
with
all
our
household
goods
olson
my
name
he
said
i
need
you
here
we
make
a
go
of
it
the
south
wind
had
risen
and
the
white
caps
flew
we
crossed
the
bay
pulling
lustily
for
very
joy
reaching
the
other
shore
we
saw
too
late
crossing
the
bay
in
search
of
us
the
small
white
sail
of
the
party
that
had
brought
us
part
way
from
the
town
so
we
turned
and
followed
them
until
at
last
we
met
to
their
relief
and
the
great
satisfaction
of
our
tired
arms
chapter
ii
arrival
our
journal
of
fox
island
begins
properly
with
the
day
of
our
final
coming
there
wednesday
september
the
at
nine
in
the
morning
of
that
day
we
slid
our
dory
into
the
water
from
the
beach
at
seward
clamped
our
little
three
and
one
half
evinrude
motor
in
the
stern
and
commenced
our
loading
since
the
main
part
of
such
a
story
as
in
all
these
following
pages
we
shall
have
to
tell
must
consist
in
the
detailing
of
the
innumerable
little
commonplaces
of
our
daily
lives
we

begin
at

also
there
were

one

case
and
a
few
other
things
and
when
these
were
stowed
away
in
the
dory
there
was
little
room
for
ourselves
however
at
ten
we
cast
off
and
started
for
fox
island
with
the
little
motor
running
beautifully
it
lasted
for
three
miles
when
at
once
with
a
bang
and
a
whir
the
motor
raced
and
the
boat
stood
motionless
on
the
calm
gray
water
through
the
fog
we
could
just
discern
the
cabin
of
a
fisherman
on
the
nearest
point
of
shore
perhaps
a
mile
distant
we
rowed
there
as
best
we
could
seated
somehow
atop
our
household
goods
we
unloaded
our
useless
motor
our
gasoline
and
our
batteries
cleared
a
little
space
in
the
boat
for
ourselves
to
man
the
oars
and
in
a
miserable
drizzling
rain
pushed
off
for
a
long
long
pull
to
the
island
by
too
literal
a
following
of
directions
i
lengthened
the
remainder
of
the
course
to
twelve
miles
and
that
we
rowed
i
do
know
how
in
four
hours
and
a
half
fortunately
the
water
was
as
calm
as
could
be
rockwell
was
a
revelation
to
me
with
scarcely
a
rest
he
pulled
at
the
heavy
oars
that
at
first
he
had
hardly
understood
to
manage
and
when
we
reached
the
island
he
was
hilarious
with
good
spirits
we
unloaded
with
the
help
of
olson
whom
by
the
way
we
must
introduce
at
some
length
and
stowed
our
goods
in
his
house
and
shed
we
cooked
our
supper
on
his
stove
and
slept
that
night
and
the
next
on
his
floor
and
then
having
our
own
quarters
by
that
time
in
passable
shape
quit
his
friendly
roof
for
the
most
hospitable
kindly
and
altogether
comfortable
roof
in
the
world
our
own
olson
is
about
years
of
age
he
a
pioneer
of
alaska
and
knows
the
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
he
has
prospected
for
gold
on
the
yukon
he
was
at
nome
with
the
first
rush
there
he
has
trapped
along
a
thousand
miles
of
coast
and
now
ever
unsuccessful
and
still
enterprising
he
is
the
proprietor
of
two
pairs
of
blue
foxes
in
corrals
and
four
goats
he
a
genial
old
man
with
a
vast
store
of
knowledge
and
true
wisdom
the
map
shows
our
fox
island
estate
our
cabin
was
built
as
a
shelter
for
angora
goats
somewhat
over
a
year
ago
it
is
a
roughly
built
log
structure
of
about
fourteen
by
seventeen
feet
inside
dimensions
and
was
quite
dark
but
for
the
small
door
and
a
two
by
two
feet
opening
on
the
western
side
we
went
to
work
upon
it
the
morning
following
our
arrival
and
in
two
days
as
has
been
told
made
it
a
fit
place
to
live
in
but
by
no
means
the
luxurious
home
that
it
was
in
our
mind
to
make
our
cabin
is
the
product
of
weeks
more
labor
to
describe
it
is
to
account

long
we
gathered
a
great
quantity
of
moss
for
calking
but
it
has
rained
so
persistently
that
it
can
not
dry
out
to
be
fit
for
use
well
it
rains
and
rains
and
rains
since
beginning
this
journal
had
not
one
fair
day
and
since
we
been
here
on
the
island
seventeen
days
there
has
been
only
rainless
day
there
has
been
but
one
cloudless
sunrise
i
awoke
that
day
just
at
dawn
and
looking
across
out
of
the
tiny
square
window
that
faces
the
water
could
see
the
blue
the
deep
blue
mountains
and
the
rosy
western
sky
behind
them
at
last
the
sun
rose
somewhere
and
tipped
the
peaks
and
the
hanging
glaciers
growing
and
growing
till
the
shadows
of
other
peaks
were
driven
down
into
the
sea
and
the
many
ranges
stood
full
in
the
morning
light
the
twilight
hours
are
so
wonderfully
long
here
as
the
sun
creeps
down
the
horizon
just
think
there
be
months
this
winter
when
we
not
see
the
sun
from
our
cove
only
see
it
touching
the
peaks
above
us
or
the
distant
mountains
it
will
be
a
strange
life
without
the
dear
warm
sun
i
wonder
if
you
can
imagine
what
fun
pioneering
is
to
be
in
a
country
where
the
fairest
spot
is
yours
for
the
wanting
it
to
cut
and
build
your
own
home
out
of
the
land
you
stand
upon
to
plan
and
create
clearings
parks
vistas
and
make
out
of
a
wilderness
an
ordered
place
of
course
so
much
was
done
nearly
all
when
i
came
but
in
clearing
up
the
woods
and
in
improving
my
own
stead
i
have
had
a
taste
of
the
great
experience
ah
it
a
fine
and
wholesome
life
another
day
the
storm
rages
out
of
doors
i
stuffed
the
largest
of
the
cracks
in
our
wall
with
woolen
socks
sweaters
and
all
manner
of
clothes
it
so
warm
and
cozy
here
now
olson
has
been
in
to
see
me
for
a
long
chat
i
believe
he
can
give
one
the
material
for
a
thrilling
book
of
adventure
take
his
story
or
enough
of
the
thousand
wild
incidents
of
it
give
it
its
true
setting
publishing
a
map
of
that
part
of
the
coast
where
his
travels
mostly
lay
let
it
be
frankly
story
retold
above
all
true
and
savoring
of
this
land
and
i
believe
no
record
of
pioneering
or
adventure
could
surpass
it
he
a
keen
philosopher
and
by
his
critical
observations
gives
his
discourse
a
fine
dignity
on
olson
return
to
idaho
in
the
after
his
first
trip
to
alaska
a
friend
of
his
a
came
out
into
the
street
seized
him
and
drew
him
into
his
place
sit
down
olson
he
said
and
tell
us
about
alaska
from
beginning
to
end
and
the
traveler
told
his
long
to
the
crowd
illustration
the
sleeper
at
last
he
finished
olson
said
his
friend
that
would
make
the
greatest
book
in
the
world
if
it
was
only
lies
gee
how
the
storm
rages
i
relieved
rockwell
who
seems
to
have
a
felon
on
his
finger
is
improving
under
the
heroic
treatment
he
submits
to
had
visions
of
operating
on
it
myself
a
deep
incision
to
the
bone
being
the
method
it
is
no
fun
having
such
ailments
to
handle
unless
you
of
the
type
olson
seems
to
be
who
if
his
eye
troubled
him
seriously
would
stick
in
his
finger
and
pull
the
eye
out
and
then
doubtless
fill
the
socket
with
tobacco
juice
we
have
reached
wednesday
september
the
eighteenth
that
day
the
sun
did
shine
we
rowed
to
seward
rockwell
and
i
stopped
for
the
motor
that
on
our
last
trip
we
had
left
by
the
way
but
found
the
surf
too
high
at
seward
the
beach
was
strewn
with
damaged
and
demolished
boats
from
a
recent
storm
moreover
in
the
town
the
glacial
stream
was
swollen
to
a
torrent
the
barriers
had
some
of
them
been
swept
away
a
bridge
was
gone
the
railroad
tracks
were
flooded
the
hospital
was
surrounded
and
almost
floated
from
its
foundations
and
we
saw
the
next
day
when
it
again
poured
rain
the
sisters
of
charity
booted
to
the
thighs
fleeing
through
the
water
to
a
safer
place
it
stormed
incessantly
for
four
days
more
although
i
had
taken
what
seemed
ample
precaution
for
the
safety
of
my
dory
she
was
caught
at
the
height
of
the
storm
by
the
exceptional
tide
of
that
season
and
carried
against
a
stranded
boat
high
up
on
the
shore
and
pinioned
there
by
a
heavy
pile
torn
from
the
wharf
but
our
boat
escaped
undamaged
seward
was
dull
for
rockwell
and
me
we
not
come
this
long
way
from
our
home
for
the
life
of
a
small
town
america
offers
nothing
to
the
tourist
but
the
wonders
of
its
natural
scenery
all
towns
are
of
one
mold
or
inspired
as
it
were
with
one
ideal
and
i
can
not
see
in
considering
the
buildings
of
a
single
period
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
any
indication
of
diversity
of
character
of
ideals
of
special
tradition
any
susceptibility
to
the
influence
of
local
conditions
nothing
in
any
typical
american
house
or
town
where
i
have
been
that
does
not
say
made
in
one
mill
there
a
god
forsaken
hideousness
and
commonplaceness
about
alaskan
architecture
that
almost
amounts
to
character
but
it
is
not
quite
bad
enough
to
redeem
itself
somewhere
in
the
wilderness
of
the
canadian
rockies
there
a
little
town
of
one
street
backed
up
against
the
towering
mountains
dominating
the
town
is
the
queen
hotel
the
last
word
in
flamboyant
gimcrack
hideousness
hotel
and
mountain
it
is
sublime
that
bald
and
crashing
contrast
on
september
third
i
wrote
to
a
friend
they
strike
me
as
needlessly
timid
about
the
sea
here
continually
talking
of
frightful
currents
and
winds
in
a
way
that
seems
incredible
to
me
and
would
i
think
to
a
new
england
fisherman
however
i
must
be
cautious
olson
says
that
in
the
winter
for
weeks
at
a
time
it
has
been
impossible
to
make
the
trip
to
seward
well
i
believe
it
when
i
try
it
and
get
stuck
three
weeks
later
tuesday
september
we
were
in
seward
the
morning
was
calm
varying
between
sun
and
rain
but
it
seemed
a
good
day
to
return
to
fox
island
rockwell
and
i
had
some
difficulty
launching
our
boat
down
the
long
beach
at
low
water
but
at
last
we
managed
it
loaded
our
goods
aboard
two
large
boxes
of
groceries
pounds
turnips
a
stove
five
lengths
of
stovepipe
a
box
of
wood
panels
two
hundred
feet
one
inch
by
two
inch
strips
suit
case
snowshoes
and
a
few
odd
parcels
illustration
the
windlass
at
ten
we
pushed
off
at
just
about
that
moment
the
sun
retired
for
the
day
and
a
fine
and
persistent
rain
began
to
fall
after
about
three
miles
we
were
overtaken
by
a
fisherman
in
a
motor
sloop
bound
to
his
camp
three
miles
further
down
the
shore
he
took
us
in
tow
and
finally
arriving
at
his
camp
begged
us
to
stay
for
a
cup
of
tea
he
was
an
englishman
i
yielded
to
the
delay
there
against
my
own
better
judgment
after
a
hearty
meal
we
left
his
cove
at
two
fifteen
still
it
drizzled
rain
and
the
breeze
blew
faintly
from
the
northeast
we
had
a
row
before
us
near
caines
head
we
encountered
squalls
from
the
south
and
were
for
sometime
in
doubt
as
to
the
true
direction
we
headed
straight
for
fox
island
only
to
find
the
wind
easterly
compelling
us
to
head
up
into
it
i
fortunately
anticipated
a
heavier
blow
and
determined
to
get
as
far
to
windward
and
as
near
the
shelter
of
the
lea
shore
as
possible
and
without
any
loss
of
time
our
propulsion
toward
the
island
i
left
to
the
tide
which
was
about
due
to
ebb
we
made
good
headway
for
a
little
time
until
the
wind
bore
upon
us
in
heavy
squalls
the
aspect
of
the
day
had
become
ominous
heavy
clouds
raced
through
the
sky
precipitating
rain
the
mountainous
land
appeared
blue
black
the
sea
a
light
but
brilliant
yellow
green
over
the
water
the
wind
blew
in
furious
squalls
raising
a
surge
of
white
caps
and
a
dangerous
chop
i
was
now
rowing
with
all
my
strength
foreseeing
clearly
the
possibility
of
disaster
for
us
scanning
with
concern
the
terrible
leeward
shore
with
its
line
of
breakers
and
steep
cliffs
rockwell
rowing
always
manfully
had
great
difficulty
in
the
rising
sea
and
wind
fortunately
he
realized
only
at
rare
moments
the
dangers
of
our
situation
we
were
now
rowing
continually
at
right
angles
to
our
true
course
i
had
but
one
hope
to
get
to
windward
before
the
rising
sea
and
gale
overpowered
us
and
carried
us
onto
the
dreaded
coast
that
offered
absolutely
no
hope
once
to
windward
i
had
the
choice
of
making
a
landing
in
some
cove
or
continuing
for
fox
island
by
running
with
the
wind
astern
at
last
the
surface
of
the
water
was
fairly
seething
under
the
advancing
squalls
the
spray
was
whipped
into
vapor
and
the
caldron
boiled
i
bent
my
back
to
the
oars
and
put
every
ounce
of
strength
into
holding
my
own
with
the
gale
it
was
a
terrible
moment
for
i
saw
clearly
the
alternative
of
continuing
and
winning
our
fight

up
rockwell
from
behind
me
at
this
tragic
instant
when
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
sometimes
i
pretend
my
toes
are
asleep
and
i
make
my
big
toe
sit
up
first
because
he

at
another

had
shown
a
little
panic
a
very
little
said
you
know
i
want
to
be
a
sailor
so
i
learn
not
to
be
afraid
at
last
we
turned
and
made
for
the
island
we
had
reached
the
point
where
with
good
chances
of
success
we
turn
and
where
we
to
we
reached
the
shelter
of
the
island
incredibly
fast
it
seemed
with
the
sea
boiling
in
our
wake
racing
furiously
as
if
to
engulf
us
and
then
bearing
us
so
smoothly
and
swiftly
upon
its
crest
that
if
it
had
not
been
so
terrible
it
would
have
been
the
most
soothing
and
delightful
motion
in
the
world
in
rounding
the
headland
of
our
cove
a
last
furious
effort
of
the
eluded
storm
careened
us
sailless
as
we
were
far
on
one
side
and
carried
us
broadside
toward
the
rocks
it
was
a
minute
before
we
could
straighten
our
boat
into
the
wind
and
pull
away
from
the
shore
then
twenty
feet
away
olson
awaited
us
on
the
beach
with
tackle
in
readiness
to
haul
our
boat
out
of
the
surf
we
landed
in
safety
looking
at
my
watch
i
found
it
to
be
a
quarter
to
six
the
last
four
miles
had
taken
us
three
hours
olson
dory
had
been
hauled
up
onto
the
grass
and
tied
down
securely
mine
was
soon
beside
it
the
tides
and
heavy
seas
of
this
time
of
year
make
every
precaution
necessary

the

queen
the
wind
that
night
continued
rising
it
blew
a

and
that
night
in

bed
rockwell
and
his
father
put
their
arms
tight
about
each
other
without
telling
why
they
did
it
wednesday
september
it
stormed
from
the
northeast
throughout
the
day
after
putting
the
cabin
in
order
and
hanging
out
our
bedding
to
dry
by
the
stove
for
we
had
found
it
very
damp
i
set
about
cutting
a
large
spruce
tree
whose
high
top
shut
out
the
light
from
our
main
windows
a
few
more
still
stand
in
the
way
the
removal
of
all
of
them
should
give
us
a
fair
amount
of
light
even
in
the
winter
when
the
sun
is
hid
it
occurs
to
me
that
it
may
be
rather
fortunate
that
my
studio
window
looks
to
the
south
i
certainly
not
be
troubled
with
sunlight
while
i
may
yet
borrow
some
of
the
brilliancy
from
above
our
mountain
top
rockwell
and
i
worked
some
time
with
the
saw
i
constantly
surprised
by
his
strength
and
stamina
rockwell
read
nine
pages
in
his
book
of
the
cave
dwellers
so
nine
of
robinson
crusoe
were
due
him
after
supper
he
undresses
and
jumps
into
bed
and
cuddles
close
to
me
as
i
sit
there
beside
him
reading
and
robinson
crusoe
is
a
story
to
grip
his
young
fancy
and
make
this
very
island
a
place
for
adventure
thursday
september
these
are
typical
days
i
begin
to
feel
sure
of
prevailing
alaska
weather
it
rains
not
hard
but
almost
constantly
nothing
is
dry
but
the
stove
and
the
wall
behind
it
the
vegetation
is
saturated
the
deep
moss
floor
of
the
woods
is
full
as
a
sponge
can
be
we
took
the
moss
that
weeks
ago
we
gathered
and
spread
along
the
shore
to
dry
and
commenced
with
this
sopping
stuff
the
calking
of
our
cabin
it
went
rapidly
and
the
two
gable
ends
are
nearly
done
what
a
difference
it
makes
when
my
fire
roared
for
the
biscuit
baking
the
heat
was
almost
unbearable
the
usual
chores
of
wood
and
water
a
little
work
at
manufacturing
stationery
supper
of
farina
corn
bread

butter
and

the
day
but
for
this
diary
is
done
friday
september
at
last
it
fair
after
a
clear
moonlit
night
i
worked
all
day
about
the
cabin
calking
it
and
almost
finishing
that
job
splitting
wood
and
working
with
the
saw
added
stops
to
the
frame
of

door
made
a
miter
box
and
cut
my
long
strips
brought
from
seward
last
trip
into
pieces
for
my
stretcher
frames
and
rockwell
all
this
time
helped
cheerfully
when
he
was
called
upon
played
boat
on
the
beach
hunted
imaginary
wild
animals
with
his
bow
and
arrow
of
design
and
was
as
always
so
contented
so
happy
that
the
day
was
not
half
long
enough
ah
the
evenings
are
beautiful
here
and
the
early
mornings
when
the
days
are
fair
no
sudden
springing
of
the
sun
into
the
sky
and
out
again
at
night
but
so
gradual
so
circuitous
a
coming
and
a
going
that
nearly
the
whole
day
is
twilight
and
the
quiet
rose
color
of
morning
and
evening
seems
almost
to
meet
at
noon
we
glance
through
our
tiny
western
window
at
sunrise
and
see
beyond
the
bay
the
many
ranges
of
mountains
from
the
somber
ones
at
the
water
edge
to
the
distant
glacier

saturday
september
beginning
fresh
but
overcast
the
day
soon
brought
us
rain
and
it
is
now
raining
gently
as
i
write
and
yet
we
accomplished
a
great
deal
clearing
of
undergrowth
a
part
of
the
woods
between
us
and
the
shore
felling
three
more
trees
and
cutting
up
a
monster
tree
with
the
saw
at
dinner
time
olson
ran
in
with
the
greatest
excitement
on
the
path
in
the
woods
near
the
outlet
of
the
lake
he
had
seen
at
one
time
five
otters
they
came
from
the
water
and
advanced
to
within
twenty
feet
of
where
he
and
nanny
the
milk
goat
stood
and
there
they
played
long
enough
for
him
to
have
taken
a
dozen
pictures
in
the
afternoon
we
saw
a
number
of
otters
at
another
place
on
the
rocks
at
one
end
of
the
beach
they
were
in
and
out
of
the
water
going
at
times
for
little
excursion
swims
far
out
into
the
harbor
then
chasing
each
other
back
and
playing
among
the
rocks
this
afternoon
i
prepared
all
my
wood
panels
to
begin
my
work
painting
them
on
both
sides
sunday
september
the
lord
must
have
been
pleased
with
us
for
the
grand
clearing
up
we
gave
this
place
of
his
olson
has
begun
to
work
toward
me
in
clearing
the
still
wild
part
of
the
intervening
space
between
our
cabins
it
begins
to
look
parklike
with
trees
stripped
of
limbs
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
ground
and
the
mossy
floor
beneath
swept
clean
with
the
saw
i
finished
up
the
giant
tree
we
felled
a
few
days
ago
and
then
the
ground
being
clear
i
cut
the
large
tree
that
kept
so
much
light
from
our
windows
the
difference
it
has
made
is
wonderful
our
room
is
flooded
with
light
there
is
a
fascination
in
cutting
trees
once
i
have
gripped
my
axe
or
even
the
tedious
saw
i
find
it
hard
to
relinquish
it
returning
to
it
again
and
again
for
one
more
cut
i
believe
that
the
clearing
of
homesteads
gave
the
pioneer
a
compelling
interest
in
life
that
was
in
wonderful
contrast
to
the
ordinary
humdrum
labor
to
which
at
first
he
must
have
been
bred
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
rapid
conquest
of
the
wilderness
begin
it
and
you
can
not
stop
rockwell
has
set
his
heart
upon
trapping
in
the
kindest
and
most
considerate
way
known
some
wild
thing
and
having
it
for
a
pet
i
rather
discouraged
his
taming
the
sea
urchin
and
persuaded
him
out
of
consideration
for
the
intelligent
creature
feelings
to
restore
him
to
the
salt
water
and
let
me
have
back
the
bread
pan
but
now
one
of
olson
box
traps
is
set
for
a
magpie
they
plentiful
here
i
built
myself
a
fine
easel
the
best
one
i
ever
had
and
put
a
shelf
under
my
drawing
table
the
room
is
clean
and
neat
it
is
in
every
way
a
congenial
place
i
do
see
why
people
need
better
homes
than
this
it
was
cloudy
most
of
and
rained
a
very
little
from
time
to
time
soon
i
can
no
longer
keep
from
painting
monday
september
thirtieth
the
morning
brilliant
clear
and
cold
with
the
wind
in
the
north
i
promised
rockwell
an
excursion
when
we
had
cut
six
sections
from
a
tree
with
the
saw
it
went
like
the
wind
then
with
cheese
chocolate
and
swedish
hard
bread
in
my
pocket
for
a
lunch
we
started
for
the
lowest
ridge
of
the
island
that
overlooks
the
east
we
had
always
believed
this
to
be
a
short
and
easy
ascent
until
one
day
just
before
supper
we
tried
it
in
a
forced
march
and
found
after
the
greatest
exertions
in
climbing
that
the
ridge
lay
still
the
good
part
of
an
hour
climb
above
us
so
though
we
chose
our
path
more
wisely
it
proved
hard
climbing
along
rough
stream
beds
across
innumerable
fallen
trees
through
alder
bramble
and
blueberry
thickets
and
always
with
the
soft
oozy
moss
underfoot
but
we
reached
the
to
the
very
edge
suddenly
the
trees
ended
the
land
ended
falling
sheer
away
four
hundred
feet
below
us
and
we
stood
in
wonder
looking
down
and
out
over
a
smooth
green
floor
of
sea
and
a
fairyland
of
mountains
peaks
and
gorges
and
headlands
that
cast
long
purple
shadows
on
the
green
water
clouds
wreathed
the
mountains
snow
was
on
their
tops
and
in
the
clear
atmosphere
both
the
land
and
the
sea
were
marvelous
for
the
beauty
of
their
infinite
detail
tiny
white
crested
wavelets
patterned
the
water
surface
with
the
utmost
precision
and
regularity
and
the
land
invited
one
to
its
smooth
and
mossy
slopes
its
dark
enchanted
forests
its
still
coves
and
sheltered
valleys
its
nobly
proportioned
peaks
it
was
a
rare
hour
for
us
two
illustration
rain
torrents
we
then
followed
the
ridge
toward
the
south
walking
in
the
smoothly
trodden
paths
of
the
porcupines
it
led
us
up
the
lofty
hill
on
the
east
side
of
the
island
between
its
two
coves
but
the
steepness
of
the
ascent
and
the
matted
thickets
of
alders
that
were
in
our
way
were
too
much
i
thought
for
rockwell
and
after
going
some
distance
farther
alone
i
returned
to
him
and
we
started
homewards
once
on
the
mountain
side
we
sat
down
in
the
moss
and
mountain
cranberry
to
rest
and
all
at
once
we
saw
a
great
old
porcupine
come
clambering
up
the
hill
a
short
way
from
us
i
spoke
to
him
in
his
own
language
and
he
was
much
pleased
he
sat
up
listened
and
then
came
almost
straight
toward
us
i
continued
talking
to
him
until
after
several
corrections
of
his
course
determined
upon
by
sitting
up
and
listening
he
arrived
within
four
or
five
feet
of
rockwell
and
sat
up
again
we
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
he
looked
so
foolish
but
he
sensed
things
to
be
wrong
dropped
down
elevated
his
quills
then
turned
and
started
off
somehow
i
could
let
him
go
without
annoying
him
so
grabbing
a
stick
i
pursued
him
poking
at
him
to
collect
a
few
quills
but
at
this
rockwell
set
up
such
a
shrieking
and
wailing
that
i
had
to
stop
and
finally
apologized
profusely
and
explained
that
i
meant
no
harm
to
the
sweet
creature
rockwell
madly
loves
wild
animals
has
not
the
slightest
fear
of
them
and
would
really
i
believe
try
out
his
theory
of
calming
the
anger
of
a
bear
by
kissing
him
then
we
came
home
and
had
a
good
dinner
i
cut
more
wood
and
at
last
after
one
month
here
on
the
island
i
painted
it
was
a
stupid
sketch
but
no
matter
i
begun
a
weasel
came
out
and
looked
at
me
as
i
worked
then
whisked
off
the
magpies
look
into
our
trap
squint
at
the
food
and
then
at
once
leave
that
neighborhood
it
is
cloudy
and
rainlike
is
it
too
much
to
hope
for
more
than
one
fair

tuesday
october
first
it
rained
we
attended
first
to
our
fascinating
chores
plying
the
saw
as
the
drizzle
fell
then
we
went
to
work
as
artists
rockwell
with
his
water
colors
and
i
with
my
oils
rockwell
has
a
number
of
good
drawings
of
the
country
here
and
of
the
things
that
have
thrilled
him
pop
the
cork
of
my
jug
of
new
made
yeast

just
struck
the
ceiling
that
brew
has
been
a
part
of
this
day

and
strained
and
bottled
also
was
completed

island
corn
souffle
take
two
cups
of
samp
whole
hominy
and
stew
for
an
indefinite
time
in
salted
water
it
should
cook
at
least
three
or
four
hours
it
should
boil
almost
dry
make
of
the
remainder
of
the
water
and
some

dissolving
in
it

the
world
on
the
condition
only
that
fox

wherever
it
is
used
i
made
a
grandfather
chair
for
myself
it
is
as
comfortable
as
it
is
beautiful
every
day
i
read
in
the
history
of
irish
literature
the
deirdre
saga
i
read
it
must
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
perfect
stories
in
all
the
world
so
little
do
we
feel
ourselves
related
here
in
this
place
to
any
one
time
or
to
any
civilization
that
at
a
thought
we
and
our
world
become
whom
and
what
we
please
rockwell
has
been
a
cave
dweller
hunting
the
primeval
forest
with
a
stone
hatchet
and
a
bow
of
alder
strung
with
a
root
to
me
it
is
the
heroic
age
in
ireland

the

artists
at
their
work
a
good
part
of
the
day
rockwell
making
several
new
drawings
in
his
book
of
wonderful
animals
we
bathed
and
i
washed
the
accumulated
clothes
of
several
weeks
and
olson
came
for
a
long
call
he
a
good
story
teller
and
his
experiences
are
without
end
and
so
closes
this
day
with
the
rain
still
pouring
monotonously
on
the
roof
thursday
october
third
was
fair
at
sunrise
cloudy
at
nine
and
showery
all
the
rest
we
worked
again
with
the
beloved
saw
setting
ourselves
an
almost
unattainable
task
and
then
surpassing
it
and
i
cleared
the
thicket
for
a
better
view
of
the
mountain
to
the
south
and
in
the
afternoon
felled
another
large
tree
stretched
canvass
for
a
while
and
painted
and
drew
and
felt

olson
rockwell
and
i
with
levers
and
blocks
turned
and
emptied
the
three
boats
that
the
recent
rains
had
almost
filled
already
we
fear
the
frost
the
mountains
have
been
capped
with
snow
all
green
has
gone
from
their
sides
the

and
happy
he
is
beautiful

friday
october
fourth
a
gloriously
lovely
day
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
wind
in
the
north
that
puts
life
into
men
up
at
sunrise
we
two
before
breakfast
the
axe
was
going
and
afterwards
we
brought
down
two
mighty
trees
the
trees
of
this
part
of
alaska
are
not
to
be
compared
with
the
giants
of
the
western
states
two
feet
is
a
large
diameter
then
i
painted
for
a
while
futilely
the
green
and
wind
blown
sea
the
pink
mountains
snowy
peaks
and
golden
morning
sky
rockwell
and
i
could
restrain
our
spirits
and
had
to
clamber
up
the
steep
mountain
side
up
up
we
went
straight
above
our
clearings
and
soon
in
looking
back
the
bay
the
lake
and
our
neck
of
land
lay
like
a
map
below
us
cliffs
and
the
steep
slopes
baffled
us
at
times
but
we
found
a
way
at
last
to
reach
the
peak
of
the
spur
above
us
there
it
was
like
a
pavilion
a
round
knoll
carpeted
with
moss
a
ring
of
slender
trees
and
beyond
that
nothing
nearer
than
the
sea
nine
hundred
feet
below
coming
down
we
ran
across
a
porcupine
toiling
up
the
slope
we
played
with
him
a
bit
and
finally
let
him
climb
a
tree
olson
would
have
had
us
bring
him
home
for
dinner
they
said
to
taste
good
we
cut
with
the
saw
a
while
in
the
afternoon
rockwell
drew
and
i
made
two
more
sketches
one
a
good
one
the
evening
at
sundown
was
more
brilliant
even
than
the
day
for
such
days
as
this
we
have
come
to
alaska
saturday
october
fifth
a
hard
day
full
of
little
bits
of
work
sawed
up
a
tree
to
punish
rockwell
for
not
studying
caulking
the
east
side
of
the
cabin
the
last
side
painted
baked
and
built
myself
an
arrangement
to
sketch
in
comfort
i
sit
on
the
board
with
my
palette
a
box
end
secured
before
me
and
my
picture
above
it
rockwell
took
his
punishment
so
to
heart
that
in
the
afternoon
he
read
ten
pages
in
his
book
all
of
has
been
overcast
but
with
a
clean
refreshing
atmosphere
in
the
account
of
anson
voyage
around
the
horn
it
is
remarked
that
fair
weather
in
those
latitudes
rarely
lasts
it
may
be
true
of
the
same
latitudes
north
monday
october
seventh
yesterday
i
wrote
nothing
in
the
diary
there
was
nothing
to
write
but
that
it
rained
rain
like
hell
olson
journal
doubtless
reads
and
ditto
for
the
storm
is
even
harder
now
the
wind
strikes
our
cabin
first
from
the
west
then
north
east
and
south
the
surface
of
the
cove
is
seething
under
the
cross
squalls
that
is
called
the
wullys
a
boat
not
strongly
managed
would
be
whipped
round
and
round
olson
has
been
much
in
to
see
us
lonely
old
man
i
drop
my
drawing
while
he
is
here
and
take
to
stretching
canvass
all
the
while
yarning
with
him
rockwell
likes
the
calls
as
a
diversion
rockwell
good
humor
and
contentment
is
without
limit
he
draws
with
the
deepest
interest
hours
a
day
reads
for
a
time
and
plays
talking
to
himself
illustration
night
we
have
good
hearty
fights
together
in
which
rockwell
attacks
me
with
all
his
strength
and
i
hit
back
with
force
in
we
have
a
good
time
washing
dishes
racing
the
washer
myself
to
beat
the
dryer
rockwell
falls
down
onto
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
race
in
a
fit
of
laughter
rockwell
happiness
is
not
complete
until
i
spank
him
i
grab
the
struggling
creature
and
throw
him
down
trying
to
hold
both
his
hands
and
feet
to
have
free
play
in
beating
him
this
i
do
with
some
strength
sometimes
using
a
stick
of
kindling
wood
the
more
it
hurts
the
better
rockwell
likes
it
up
to
a
limit
that
we
never
reach
so
much
for
the
day
play
of
our
work
mine
is
mostly
over
the
drawing
table
both
yesterday
and
i
made
good
drawings
and
my
ideas
come
crowding
along
fast
cooking
somehow
is
the
least
troublesome
of
all
the
daily
chores
we
live
as
may
be
imagined
with
a
simplicity
that
would
send
a
hoover

from

does
it

again
half
full
of

so
we
turned
her
and
the

primed
it
and
finished

around

a
thrilling
book
late
this
afternoon
it
began
to
clear
the
sun
shone
and
we
were
presently
at
work
with
the

only
to
be
driven
in
again
by
the

wednesday

fair

far
away
as

a
sharp
but
cloudy
afternoon
and
sundown
with
brilliant
light
in
the
western
sky
spell
change
olson
says
the
foxes
will
not
eat
and
that
this
is
invariably
a
sign
of
change
to
good
days
that
in
bad
weather
they
eat
and
in
fair
they
abstain
it
poured
in
the
morning
and
we
worked
indoors
after
dinner
we
all
moved
a
lumber
pile
that
stood
on
the
shore
abreast
of
our
cabin
to
a
place
nearer
olson
this
only
to
better
our
view
of
the
water
we
sawed
wood
for
a
while
and
piled
all
that
we
have
so
far
cut
ready
for
winter
use
there
are
in
all
fifty
sections
of
short
stove
wood
that
is
a
month
and
a
half
supply
i
painted
towards
evening
and
made
two
good
sketches
the
nights
have
grown
colder
for
the
past
two
days
the
mountains
across
from

the

have
been
covered
with
snow
downwards
to
half
their
height
the
farther
ranges
have
for

been
white
they
beautiful
and
invite

to
go
climbing

thursday
october
tenth
it
raining
all
day
has
been
overcast
but
sharp
and
clear
it
was
for
us
all
a
day
of
hard
work
we
cleared
up
the
woods
between
cabin
and
ours
carrying
one
large
pile
of
brush
from
our
door
yard
to
the
beach
and
burning
another
huge
one
that
was
a
wild
sight
as
night
came
it
had
become
a
great
fire
of
logs
burning
steadily
and
lighting
up
all
the
woods
around
it
is
still
burning
in
the
pouring
rain
we
sawed
a
little
always
more
than
keeping
pace
with
our
consumption
of
wood
rockwell
worked
almost
the
whole
day
and
went
to
bed
tired
i
read
to
him
an
hour
he
loves
to
hear
poetry
we
set
an
elaborate
contrivance
to
catch
a
magpie
and
were
humiliated
by
the
bird
who
walked
round
and
round
the
snare
eying
it
wisely
then
suddenly
rushed
in
only
far
enough
to
secure
a
piece
of
decoy
bait
and
fled

friday
october
eleventh
this
day
we
should
have
been
in
seward
it
was
calm
although
it
rained
from
time
to
time
olson
offered
to
tow
us
across
to
caine
head
but
the
rain
coming
up
as
we
were
about
to
start
in
the
morning
we
waited
till
afternoon
started
proceeded
half
a
mile
encountered
engine
trouble
and
finally
ignominiously
rowed
home
i
pulling
olson
and
his
motor
and
rockwell
bringing
in
our
own
dory
if
it
had
not
been
so
late
we
would
have
kept
on
we
have
a
magpie
i
saw
one
hop
into
olson
shed
quickly
ran
and
closed
the
door
and
there
he
was
now
he
in
a
cage
set
on
a
specially
constructed
shelf
on
our
front
gable
he
a
garrulous
creature
and
bites
angrily
but
he
a
youngster
and
we
hope
to
teach
him
to
say
all
sorts
of
pretty
things
olson
says
they
take
naturally
to
swearing
so
rockwell
has
at
last
a
pet
if
only
it
will
hold
calm
it
is
fair
and
starlight
but
we
can
never
be
sure
of
the
weather
constancy
we
hold
everything
in
readiness
to
start
in
the
morning
saturday
october
twelfth
a
mild
and
lovely
day
on
our
island
but
in
the
bay
a
breeze
from
the
north
that
would
have
made
our
rowing
to
seward
difficult
still
we
wait
with
our
things
assembled
for
the
trip
we
shall
go
at
the
very
first
good
chance
this
morning
olson
cleared
the
limbs
from
the
trees
about
us
to
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
ground
only
the
tall
clean
trunks
are
now
between
us
and
our
mountains
across
the
bay
i
painted
most
of
the
afternoon
my
canvas
is
still
quite
impossible
rough
and
absorbent
we
built
a
large
cage
for
the
magpie
he
was
so
restless
in
his
small
one
and
now
he
quite
contented
rockwell
said
that
he
would
like
to
live
here
always
that
when
he
was
grown
he
come
here
with
his
many
children
and
me
if
i
was
not
dead
and
stay
it
is
hard
to
write
it
is
hard
to
work
with
the
trip
to
seward
at
hand
olson
says
it
is
sunday
i
think
he
right
somehow
i
missed
a
day
sunday
october
thirteenth
i
still
keep
to
my
chronology
until
we
find
out
from
seward
where
we
stand
a
wonderfully
beautiful
day
with
a
raging
northwest
wind
i
must
sometime
honor
the
northwest
wind
in
a
great
picture
as
the
embodiment
of
clean
strong
exuberant
life
the
joy
of
every
young
thing
bearing
energy
on
its
wings
and
the
will
to
triumph
how
i
remember
at
monhegan
on
such
a
day
when
it
seemed
that
every
living
thing
must
emerge
from
its
house
or
its
hole
or
its
nest
to
breathe
the
clean
air
and
exult
in
it
when
men
could
stand
on
the
hilltops
and
look
far
over
the
green
sea
and
the
distant
land
and
delight
in
the
infinite
detail
of
the
view
discerning
distant
ships
at
sea
and
remote
blue
islands
and
over
the
land
sparkling
cities
and
such
enchanting
forests
and
pastures
that
the
spirit
leaped
the
intervening
miles
and
with
a
new
delight
claimed
the
whole
earth
to
the
farthest
mountains
and
beyond
on
such
a
day
there
crept
from
his
hole
an
artist
and
shading
his
squinting
eyes
with
his
hand
saluted
the
day
with
a
groan
how
can
one
paint
he
said
such
sharpness
here
is
no
mystery
no
beauty
and
he
crept
back
this
fog
lover
to
wait
for
earth
sick
spell
to
return
this
morning
the
magpie
sang
or
recited
poetry
he
made
strange
glad
noises
in
his
throat
and
that
in
a
cage
we
worked
the
rest
of
us
like
mad
at
olson
resting
at
last
said
well
done
a
great
day
work
and
after
that
i
painted
a
sketch
cut
and
trimmed
three
small
spruce
trees
and
then
it
being
dark
prepared
supper
but
when
do
we
go
to
seward
my
bag
is
packed
olson
begins
each
day
by
testing
his
motor
the
wind
must
moderate
in
time
we
see
it
pass
our
cove
driving
the
water
as
in
a
it
swept
the
cove
itself
rockwell
went
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
he
has
a
delightful
time
on
his
rambles
discovering
goats
wool
on
the
bushes
following
the
paths
of
the
porcupines
to
their
holes
and
finding
the
porcupine
himself
he
always
returns
with
some
marvelous
discovery
or
new
enthusiasm
over
his
explorations
he
has
been
practicing
writing
he
says
that
if
he
could
only
write
he
would
put
down
the
wonderful
stories
of
his
dreams
these
stories
would
run
into
volumes

sunrise
tuesday
october
fifteenth
yesterday
we
left
the
island
the
day
was
calm
though
cloudy
and
at
times
it
rained
olson
towed
us
to
caine
head
from
there
we
made
good
time
rockwell
rowing
like
a
seasoned
oarsman
as
indeed
he
has
now
a
right
to
be
called
we
stopped
at
the
camp
where
we
had
in
august
left
our
engine
and
brought
that
away
with
us
as
well
as
some
turnips
and
half
a
dozen
heads
of
beautiful
lettuce
grown
on
that
spot
by
night
it
was
raining
hard
and
blowing
from
the
southeast
we
spent
the
evening
at
the
postmaster
house
playing
i
on
the
flute
to
miss
postmaster
accompaniment
it
went
splendidly
and
until
midnight
we
played
beethoven
bach
hayden
gluck
tchaikowsky
till
it
seemed
like
old
times
at
home
then
rockwell
with
his
eyes
shut
in
sleep
consumed
a
piece
of
apricot
pie
and
a
glass
of
milk
and
we
came
home
bringing
along
two
glasses
of
wild
currant
preserve
i
read
my
letters
over
and
then
went
to
bed
but
the
storm
raged
by
that
time
and
i
could
sleep
for
worry
about
my
boat
at
last
i
rose
and
dressed
and
went
down
to
the
shore
the
dory
was
safely
stranded
but
too
low
down
so
with
great
toil
i
worked
her
higher
up
the
beach
beyond
high
water
it
has
rained
incessantly
i
have
bought
a
few
odd
supplies
and
registered
for
the
draft
above
all
the
engine
has
resumed
its
running
and
we
return
to
fox
island
under
power
i
know
nothing
about
an
engine
but
i
have
eight
miles
to
learn
in
before
the
only
hazardous
part
of
the
voyage
begins
rockwell
and
i
spent
the
evening
at
the
house
of
a
young
man
whom
we
found
congenial
and
who
above
all
is
a
friend
of
a
young
german
mechanic
for
whom
i
a
liking
so
the
four
of
us
sang
the
evening
through
seated
before
a
great
open
fire
the
house
is
of
logs
and
stands
out
of
the
town
on
the
border
of
the
wilderness
there
are
spots
like
this
little
house
and
its
hospitable
hearth
that
show
even
the
commercial
desert
of
seward
to
have
its
oases
and
now
in
our
room
rockwell
is
asleep
in
bed
it
is
past
midnight
i
am
thinking
of
dear
friends
at
home
and
i
bid
them
affectionately
thursday
october
seventeenth
yesterday
in
seward
was
about
as
every
other
day
we
spent
it
between
in
our
hotel
room
and
visiting
from
store
to
store
it
poured
rain
and
blew
from
the
southeast
we
spent
our
evening
with
the
german
we
have
planned
with
him
to
signal
back
and
forth
from
seward
particularly
to
send
me
the
news
of
peace
if
i
can
distinguish
with
glasses
a
electric
light
that
he
will
show
from
a
house
on
the
highest
point
in
the
town
then
by
means
of
the
morse
code
with
which
i
am
furnished
and
which
he
knows
i
receive
messages
on
appointed
days
rockwell
and
i
went
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
our
beach
to
a
point
that
commands
a
view
up
the
bay
to
seward
and
lighted
a
bonfire
there
boehm
the
german
was
regarding
us
we
presume
through
a
telescope
on
sunday
night
if
it
is
clear
we
are
to
look
for
his
light
the
difficulty
will
be
to
distinguish
it
from
others
we
left
seward
this
morning
at
our
dory
laden
with
about
one
thousand
pounds
of
freight
including
ourselves
the
little
three
and
one
half
motor
worked
splendidly
and
carried
us
to
the
island
in
a
little
over
two
and
a
quarter
hours
the
day
was
calm
to
begin
with
with
a
rising
north
wind
as
we
crossed
from
caine
head
on
the
island
we
found
a
visitor
there
had
been
two
other
men
but
they
were
gone
to
seward
the
night
before
all
had
been
on
monday
forced
by
the
rough
sea
to
turn
back
from
attempting
to
go
around
the
westward
cape
the
old
fellow
who
is
still
here
told
me
that
in
the
twenty
years
that
he
had
been
in
alaska
he
had
never
seen
such
weather
that
good
news
at
seward
the
mountains
are
covered
with
snow
to
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
town
level
i
tired
this
ends
incidentally
my
dates
proved
to
be
correct
when
i
reached
seward
illustration
adventure
oh
i
almost
forgotten
our
loss
the
poor
magpie
lay
dead
on
the
floor
of
his
cage
so
we
found
him
killed
i
believe
by
the
storm
for
olson
neglected
to
cover
him
rockwell
who
straight
on
landing
had
run
there
wept
bitterly
but
finally
found
much
consolation
in
giving
him
a
very
decent
burial
and
marking
the
spot
with
a
wooden
cross
friday
october
eighteenth
the
night
is
beautiful
beyond
thought
all
the
bay
is
flooded
with
moonlight
and
in
that
pale
glow
the
snowy
mountains
appear
whiter
than
snow
itself
the
full
moon
is
almost
straight
above
us
and
shining
through
the
tree
tops
into
our
clearing
makes
the
old
stumps
quite
lovely
with
its
quiet
light
and
the
forest
around
is
as
black
as
the
abyss
although
it
is
nearly
ten
rockwell
is
still
awake
it
is
his
birthday
by
our
choice
his
one
present
a
cheap
edition
of
wood
natural
history
illustrated
has
filled
his
head
with
dreams
of
his
beloved
wild
animals
i
began
to
teach
him
to
sing
we
tried
brahms
wiegenlied
with
little
success
and
then
schlaf
kindlein
schlaf
which
went
better
these
songs
and
many
other
german
songs
all
with
english
words
are
in
the
song
book
i
bought
him
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
patience
and
the
time
to
succeed
with
rockwell
in
this
three
men
are
now
with
olson
in
his
cabin
for
the
two
who
were
gone
to
seward
returned
they
are
younger
men
one
of
them
emsweiler
a
guide
of
this
country
i
spent
an
interesting
hour
with
them
this
evening
olson
told
me
that
his
age
is
the
smell
of
fresh
bread
is
in
our
cabin
for
i
baked
baking
darning
of
socks
putting
the
cabin
in
order
and
the
building
of
a
shelf
these
with
the
other
usual
chores
were
the
whole
day
work
a
profitless
day
lies
on
my
conscience
i
shall
draw
a
little
and
then
go
to
bed
saturday
october
nineteenth
was
raw
and
cloudy
mild
and
sunny
in
the
morning
windy
in
the
afternoon
dead
calm
so
that
the
hills
were
reflected
in
the
bay
the
men
have
left
i
am
glad
to
say
not
that
they
were
in
themselves
at
all
objectionable
but
it
somehow
did
violence
to
the
quiet
of
this
place
to
have
others
about
emsweiler
slaughtered
one
of
the
goats
for
olson
so
there
now
one
less
of
us
here
i
felled
a
large
tree
and
later
sharpened
the
saw
preparatory
to
cutting
it
up
the
sun
set
in
the
utmost
splendor
and
left
in
its
wake
blazing
clouds
in
a
sky
of
luminous
green
not
many
more
days
shall
we
see
the
sun
it
sets
now
close
to
the
southern
headland
of
our
cove
rockwell
works
every
day
on
his
wild
animal
book
to
obtain
absolutely
new
and
original
names
for
his
strange
creatures
he
has
devised
an
interesting
method
with
eyes
closed
he
prints
a
name
or
rather
a
group
of
miscellaneous
letters
naturally
the
result
he
perceives
on
opening
his
eyes
is
astonishing
sunday
october
twentieth
it
has
been
a
beautiful
clear
cold
violent
northwest
day
painted
on
and
off
all
day
with
wood
cutting
between
one
ca
stop
going
in
such
weather
and
you
ca
stand
still
for
it
is
too
icy
cold
and
windy
rockwell
and
i
have
just
now
eight
returned
from
down
the
beach
where
we
went
to
look
for
lights
from
seward
but
we
could
distinguish
nothing
meant
for
us
the
moon
has
risen
and
illuminates
the
mountain
tops
but
we
and
all
our
cove
are
still
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
night
it
is
most
dramatic
the
spruces
about
us
deepen
the
shadow
to
black
while
above
them
the
stone
faces
of
the
mountain
glisten
and
the
sky
has
the
brightness
of
a
kind
of
day
olson
brought
us
goat
chops
for
dinner
we
could
not
have
told
them
from
lamb
this
afternoon
late
a
small
power
boat
appeared
in
the
bay
attempting
to
make
its
way
toward
seward
after
some
progress
the
wind
forced
her
steadily
and
swiftly
back
when
we
last
saw
her
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
make
the
shelter
of
our
island
or
one
of
the
outer
islands
the
while
driving
steadily
seaward
it
a
wild
night
to
be
out
in
the
bay
though
doubtless
calm
at
sea
it
is
such
an
adventure
that
we
must
be
on
our
guard
against
as
we
look
across
the
bay
toward
bear
glacier
which
is
hidden
by
a
point
of
land
we
can
see
the
effect
of
the
north
wind
sweeping
down
the
glacier
a
mist
driving
seaward
it
is
nothing
less
than
the
fine
spray
of
that
water
monday
october
it
is
so
late
that
i
shall
write
only
a
little
was
again
wonderful
a
true
golden
and
blue
northwest
day
i
have
painted
and
sawed
wood
and
built
myself
a
splendid
saw
horse
olson
thinks
i
have
already
cut
my
winter
supply
of
wood
but
it
seems
to
me
far
from
it
rockwell
has
been
most
of
the
day
at
his
own
animal
book
making
some
strange
and
beautiful
birds
this
morning
the
ground
was
frozen
with
a
hard
crust
it
did
not
thaw
throughout
the
day
and
again
it
is
very
cold
winter
is
at
last
upon
us
the
long
long
winter
and
the
sun
retreats
day
by
day
farther
toward
the
mountain
i
look
to
the
sun
going
with
a
kind
of
dread
we
have
seen
nothing
of
the
boat
that
last
night
was
driven
to
shelter
we
believe
the
men
to
be
in
the
other
cove
of
our
island
chapter
iv
winter
endlessly
day
after
day
the
journal
goes
on
recording
a
dreary
monotony
of
rain
and
cloud
who
has
ever
dwelt
so
entirely
alone
that
the
most
living
things
in
all
the
universe
about
are
wind
and
rain
and
snow
where
the
elements
dominate
and
control
your
life
where
at
getting
up
and
bedtime
and
many
an
hour
of
night
and
day
between
you
question
helplessly
as
a
poor
slave
his
master
the
will
of
the
mighty
forces
of
the
sky
dawn
breaks
you
jump
from
bed
stand
barefoot
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
look
through
the
straight
trunked
spruces
at
the
brightening
world
and
read
at
sight
god
will
for
one
more
whole
long
day
of
life
ah
god
it
rains
again
and
sitting
on
the
bed
you
wearily
draw
on
your
heavy
boots
and
begin
the
special
labors
of
a
rainy
day
or
maybe
at
the
sight
of
clouds
again
you
laugh
at
the
weather
man
or
curse
at
him
good
naturedly
still
you
must
do
those
chores
and
all
the
other
daily
chores
in
hot
garments
that
is
destiny
most
of
the
time
to
do
ourselves
real
justice
we
met
the
worst
of
weather
with
a
battle
cry
worked
hard
and
then
made
up
for
outdoor
dreariness
and
wet
by
heaping
on
the
comforts
of
indoors
dry
cozy
warmth
good
things
to
eat
and
lots
to
do
we
have
reached
late
fall
for
northern
latitudes
the
sky
is
brooding
ominously
heavy
dull
and
raw
winter
seems
to
be
closing
in
upon
us
we
driven
to
work
as
if
in
fear
hurry
hurry
saw
the
great
drums
of
spruce
roll
them
over
the
ground
and
stack
them
high
calk
tight
with
hemp
the
cabin
windward
eaves
so
that
no
breath
of
wind
can
enter
there
and
freeze
the
food
inside
upon
the
shelf
set
up
the
stove
where
it
will
keep
you
warm
warm
feet
in
bed
and
a
warm
back
while
painting
patch
up
the
poor
paper
roof
two
or
three
holes
we
find
and
we
are
sure
it
leaks
from
twenty
about
the
cabin
pile
the
hemlock
boughs
and
warm
making
a
green
slope
almost
to
the
eaves
now
it
looks
cozy
outside
and
in
the
last
is
done
to
make
us
ready
for
the
worst
and
just
in
time
it
is
the
evening
of
october
and
the
feathery
snow
has
just
begun
to
fall
olson
comes
stamping
in
well
well
he
cries
how
this
how
does
our
winter
suit
you
it
suits
us
perfectly
the
house
is
warm
rockwell
in
bed
and
i
am
reading
treasure
island
to
him
what
are
you
going
to
make
of
him
asked
olson
that
night
speaking
of
rockwell
i
was
at
that
moment
pouring
beans
into
the
pot
for
baking
i
slowed
the
stream
and
dropped
them
one
by
one
thief
doctor
lawyer
merchant
chief
how
in
the
world
can
anyone
lay
plans
for
a
youngster
life
illustration
on
the
height
rockwell
lay
in
his
bed
dreaming
maybe
of
an
existence
lovelier
far
than
anything
the
poor
discouraged
imagination
of
a
man
could
reach
a
child
could
make
a
paradise
of
earth
life
is
so
simple
unerringly
he
follows
his
desires
making
the
greatest
choices
first
then
onward
into
a
narrowing
pathway
until
the
true
goal
is
reached
how
can
one
preach
of
beauty
or
teach
another
wisdom
these
things
are
of
an
infinite
nature
and
in
every
one
of
us
in
just
proportion
there
is
no
priesthood
of
the
truth
we
live
in
many
worlds
rockwell
and
i
the
world
of
the
books
we
read
an
always
changing
one
robinson
crusoe
treasure
island
the
visionary
world
of
william
blake
the
saga
age
water
babies
and
the
glorious
celtic
past
rockwell
own
world
of
fancy
kingdom
of
beasts
the
world
he
dreams
about
and
draws
and
my
created
land
of
striding
heroes
and
poor
men
real
as
i
have
painted
them
or
to
me
nothing
is
and
then
all
round
about
our
common
daily
itself
more
wonderful
than
we
have
half
a
notion
of
is
it
to
be
believed
that
we
are
here
alone
this
boy
and
i
far
north
out
on
an
island
wilderness
seagirt
on
a
terrific
coast
it
as
we
pictured
it
and
wanted
it
a
year
and
more
ago
yes
dreams
come
true
and
now
the
snow
falls
softly
winter
to
meet
our
challenge
has
begun
short
notes
in
the
journal
mark
treasure
island
swift
passage
then
enter
water
babies
just
after
rockwell
heart
and
mine
i
have
recorded
it
but
kingsley
must
lose
his
friends
a
warning
to
the
snob
in
literature
how
it
did
weary
us
and
madden
us
his
pride
unless
we
outright
laughed
at
last
finished
that
an
event
when
kingsley
is
showing
off
moralizing
and
between
his
religious
cant
and
his
english
snobbery
he
is
in
spite
of
his
occasional
sweet
sentiment
quite
unendurable
so
we
read
from
fairy
tales
forever
lovely
and
true
children
have
their
own
fine
literary
taste
that
we
know
quite
too
little
about
they
love
all
real
authentic
happenings
and
they
love
pure
fairy
tale
but
to
them
fiction
in
the
guise
of
truth
is
wrong
and
fairy
romance
unconvincing
in
its
details
is
ridiculous
action
they
like
the
deed
not
thoughts
about
it
doubtless
the
simple
saga
form
is
best
of
all
life
as
it
happens
neither
right
nor
wrong
words
that
they
can
understand
things
they
can
comprehend
interesting
facts
or
thrilling
fancy
such
simple
things
delight
the
child
that
half
of
robinson
crusoe
and
three
quarters
of
the
smug
family
from
switzerland
are
forgiven
for
the
sweet
kernel
of
pure
adventure
that
is
there
as
for
adventure
that
is
relative
where
little
happens
and
the
gamut
of
expression
is
narrow
life
is
still
full
of
joy
and
sorrow
you
stirred
by
simple
happenings
in
a
quiet
world
the
that
early
in
september
played
in
the
shoal
water
of
our
cove
not
thirty
feet
from
land
rolled
their
huge
shining
bodies
into
view
plunged
raced
where
we
still
could
follow
their
gleaming
white
patch
under
water
there
a
thrill
the
battles
that
occurred
that
month
between
huge
fish
out
in
the
bay
their
terrible
mysterious
black
arms
that
beat
the
water
with
a
sound
like
cannon
the
plunge
into
the
depths
of
the
poor
frantic
wounded
whale
and
his
return
again
for
air
again
the
thunder
sound
and
flying
foam
and
spray
as
the
dread
black
arm
is
beating
on
the
sea
then
calm
you
shudder
at
that
huge
death
that
was
a
drama
for
fox
islanders
and
later
the
poor
magpie
death
real
tears
were
shed
from
a
poor
boy
heart
two
strangers
come
these
days
and
stop
with
olson
they
on
the
search
of
that
small
craft
that
we
saw
driving
seaward
in
a
tempest
illustration
the
day
work
is
mystery
was
she
adrift
unmanned
broke
from
her
moorings
or
was
there
life
aboard
as
we
had
thought
in
that
case
she
been
stolen
and
who
were
the
men
and
where
wrecked
safely
on
some
island
drowned
or
driven
out
to
sea
no
man
shall
ever
know
a
porcupine
is
captured
wandering
near
our
house
we
build
for
him
a
cozy
home
he
does
like
it
much
but
still
he
we
care
for
him
day
after
day
he
twines
himself
about
our
hearts
then
at
last
one
day
when
we
pastured
him
in
freedom
out
in
the
new
fallen
snow
trusting
his
tracks
to
lead
us
to
him
the
goats
cut
in
and
spoiled
the
trail
and
he
was
lost
to
us
olson
has
gone
to
seward
days
of
waiting
days
of
waiting
how
many
times
do
we
travel
down
the
cove
to
the
point
from
whence
caine
head
is
seen
going
in
hope
returning
gloomily
the
goats
beset
us
yearning
for
their
missing
master
billy
that
maddening
beast
eats
up
one
corner
of
our
broom
i
throw
a
heavy
armful
of
kindling
wood
into
his
face
and
he
just
sneezes
but
rockwell
plays
with
the
goats
as
if
they
human
or
rather
as
if
he
were
goat
they
half
believe
it
he
has
told
me
and
rockwell
so
do
sunday
november
third
was
gloriously
bright
and
clear
with
a
strong
northwest
wind
the
mountains
are
covered
with
snow
beautiful
beyond
description
i
painted
continuously
all
the
day
except
when
rockwell
and
i
plied
the
saw
it
is
no
little
thing
to
have
one
work
on
a
day
like
this
out
under
such
a
blue
sky
by
the
foaming
green
sea
and
the
fairy
mountains
three
days
go
by
it
rains
and
hails
and
snows
and
then
is
quiet
over
the
dead
still
air
comes
the
roar
of
pounding
seas
immense
and
white
they
pile
on
the
black
cliffs
of
caine
head
the
wash
of
a
storm
at
sea
still
over
the
heaving
glassy
water
we
look
in
vain
for
olson
dark
days
and
the
short
hours
are
long
with
waiting
how
many
times
we
traveled
down
the
cove
to
look
toward
seward
how
many
score
of
times
we
peered
through
the
little
panes
of
our
west
window
never
to
find
the
thing
we
sought
for
i
loaded
my
arms
with
firewood
from
the
pile
i
turn
my
head
and
there
in
our
cove
before
my
very
eyes
at
last
is
olson
this
is
november
sixth
nine
days
away
the
war
is
over
cried
olson
as
he
landed
by
all
that
holy
in
life
may
the
world
have
found
through
its
mad
war
at
least
some
fragrance
of
the
peace
and
freedom
that
we
discovered
growing
like
a
flower
wild
on
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
long
into
night
i
read
the
mail
count
sweaters
caps
and
woolen
stockings
all
that
the
mail
has
brought
it
is
late
rockwell
is
asleep
the
room
is
cold
it
snows
and
now
instead
of
bed
i
stir
the
fire
and
begin
my
work
thursday
november
seventh
a
true
winter
day
with
the
snow
deep
on
the
ground
and
the
profound
and
characteristic
winter
silence
of
the
to
be
sensed
even
in
this
ever
silent
place
at
earliest
daylight
began
a
heavy
thunderstorm
with
lightning
all
about
and
a
downpour
of
hail
it
occurred
intermittently
throughout
the
morning
i
did
the
washing
using
olson
washboard
and
getting
the
clothes
nearly
white
olson
is
full
of
amusing
gossip
to
the
curious
in
seward
who
asked
him
why
i
chose
to
be
in
this
spot
he
replied
you
damn
fools
you
do
understand
an
artist
at
all
do
you
suppose
shakespeare
wrote
his
plays
with
a
silly
crowd
of
men
and
women
hanging
around
him
no
sir
an
artist
has
to
be
left
alone
well
what
does
he
paint
that
his
business
sometimes
i
see
he
has
a
mountain
there
on
a
picture
and
next
time
i
see
it
been
changed
to
a
lake
or
something
else
illustration
meal
time
one
can
imagine
olson
with
his
questioners
the
thing
he
most
wants
his
ambition
one
might
say
is
to
make
people
sit
up
and
take
notice
of
fox
island
his
homestead
it
is
in
fact
one
reason
why
he
brought
us
here
to
live
thanks
to
its
amateur
detective
seward
had
rejoiced
for
a
short
time
in
rumors
of
a
german
spy
on
fox
island
i
told
olson
that
the
authorities
might
still
come
and
remove
me
he
flared
up
i
like
to
see
them
try
it
we
could
take
to
the
mountains
with
guns
and
more
than
one
of
them
would
never
try
the
thing
again
and
then
he
went
on
to
tell
me
how
in
idaho
he
had
tracked
for
days
and
weeks
a
notorious
gang
of
outlaws
and
and
at
last
run
them
to
earth
one
of
his
most
thrilling
and
i
believe
absolutely
true
stories
of
his
adventures
at
this
moment
a
steamer
is
blowing
in
the
bay
navigating
by
the
echo
from
the
mountain
faces
she
is
near
to
us
now
but
hidden
by
the
snowstorm
rockwell
has
begun
to
write
the
story
of
a
long
waking
dream
of
his
it
a
sweet
idea
and
reads
most
amusingly
in
his
own
queer
spelling
now
though
it
is
already
late
i
must
draw
a
while
longer
and
then
after
bathing
in
the
bread
pan
sit
up
in
bed
and
read
a
chapter
of
the
life
of
blake
friday
november
eighth
it
is
so
late
that
i
half
expect
to
see
the
dawn
begin
i
have
been
working
on
a
drawing
of
rockwell
and
his
father
and
it
looks
ever
so
fine
whew
just
at
this
moment
the
wind
has
swept
down
upon
our
cabin
and
blown
the
roof
in
as
far
as
it
would
with
great
creaking
yield
and
then
passed
on
sucking
it
out
in
its
wake
to
such
a
spread
that
a
board
that
lay
across
overhead
like
a
has
fallen
with
a
crash
and
clatter
and
rockwell
sleeps
on
the
wind
does
blow
and
it
does
stop
outside
the
walls
of
the
cabin
either
my
lamp
flutters
annoyingly
but
ah
the
room
is
comfortable
and
warm
this
morning
it
being
at
first
wondrously
fair
rockwell
and
i
set
out
for
a
boat
ride
but
what
with
the
fussing
of
installing
our
motor
and
the
launching
of
our
cumbersome
boat
the
wind
was
given
time
to
rise
and
spoil
the
day
for
us
but
we
went
out
into
the
bay
and
played
in
the
waves
to
see
what
the
north
wind
could
do
the
chop
was
devilish
short
and
deep
the
boat
bridged
from
one
crest
to
another
with
it
seemed
a
clear
tunnel
underneath
and
then
running
up
onto
a
wave
mountain
she
would
jump
off
its
dizzy
peak
landing
with
a
splash
in
the
valley
beyond
and
dousing
us
well
with
water
in
a
calmer
spot
i
stopped
the
engine
and
sketched
our
island
after
which
we
rowed
home
the
rest
of
the
day
we
worked
on
the
motor
first
to
find
out
why
she
would
run
then
having
found
and
fixed
that
to
put
other
parts
in
still
better
order
and
then
by
far
the
longest
time
and
still
to
continue
to
mend
what
in
the
course
of
our
fixing
we
had
broken
rockwell
in
bed
asleep
dreaming
of
the
little
wild
nightingale
that
sang
of
freedom
to
that
poor
unhappy
chinese
emperor
while
far
from
here
in
streets
and
towns
the
tin
nightingale
of
liberty
charms
the
world
and
it
now
my
reading
time
my
time
for
bread
and
jam
and
a
back
the
days
run
by
true
winter
days
snow
cold
and
wind
what
wind
it
is
terrifying
when
from
our
mountain
tops
those
fierce
blasts
sweep
upon
us
roaring
as
they
come
flying
twigs
and
ice
beat
on
the
roof
the
boards
creak
and
groan
under
the
wind
weight
the
lamp
flutters
moss
is
driven
in
and
falls
upon
my
the
canvas
over
our
bed
flaps
and
then
in
a
moment
the
wind
is
gone
and
the
world
is
still
again
save
for
the
distant
wash
of
the
waves
and
the
far
off
forest
roar

day
end
olson
is
full
of
treats
his
latest
was
in
pleasant
violation
of
the
law
from
a
bottle
of
pale
liquid
half
filled
with
raisins
he
poured
me
a
drink
mixing
it
with
an
equal
amount
of
ginger
ale
and
a
dash
of
sugar
it
tasted
pretty
good
quite
thrilling
in
fact
what
is
it
i
asked
pure
alcohol
he
said
smacking
his
lips
olson
then
launched
forth
on
confidential
advice
from
one
trapper
to
another
on
how
to
trap
men
in
my
case
rich
patrons
he
has
my
need
of
them
quite
upon
his
mind
olson
eggs
by
the
way
taste
good
enough
they
gave
him
in
seward
dozen
bad
eggs
to
bring
out
for
the
foxes
we
have
eaten
a
dozen
i
cracked
seventeen
to
find
six
for
dinner
onion
omelette
is
the
fashion
to
cook
them
in
rockwell
pronounces
them
delicious
and
well
so

hard
hard
at
work
little
play
not
too
much

the
wind
blows
ceaselessly
rockwell
is
forever
good
industrious
kind
and
happy
he
reads
now
quite
freely
from
any
book
drawing
has
become
a
natural
and
regular
occupation
for
him
almost
a
recreation
for
he
can
draw
in
both
a
serious
and
a
humorous
vein
at
this
moment
he
waiting
in
bed
for
some
music
and
another
andersen
fairy
tale
another
day
has
gone
and
a
new
morning
is
hours
on
its
way
out
in
the
moonlit
night
strained
tired
eyes
open
wide
and
are
made
clear
again
cramped
knees
must
dance
in
the
crisp
air
the
curved
spine
bends
backward
as
the
upstretched
arms
describe
that
superb
embracing
gesture
of
the
yawn
november
the
thirteenth
how
time
sweeps
by
and
i
look
over
the
black
water
that
we
soon
must
cross
again
to
seward
the
wind
bursts
around
the
cabin
corner
i
shiver
and
go
to
bed
chapter
v
waiting
thursday
november
fourteenth
we
ready
to
go
to
seward
the
moment
the
weather
moderates
which
may
be
not
for
two
weeks
or
two
months
i
packed
blankets
and
several
days
food
in
a
great
knapsack
so
that
if
we
driven
to
land
somewhere
we
not
perish
of
hunger
and
this
trip
while
it
may
be
carried
out
speedily
may
on
the
other
hand
strand
us
days
without
number
in
seward
and
cost
three
or
four
times
that
many
dollars
the
wind
is
still
in
the
north
the
days
are
wonderfully
beautiful
and
the
nights
no
less
this
very
night
rockwell
and
i
skated
for
the
third
time
ah
but
it
was
glorious
on
the
lake
the
moon
high
above
us
in
a
cloudless
sky
the
snow
and
ice
on
the
mountain
sides
glistening
and
the
spruces
black
we
skated
together
hand
in
hand
like
sweethearts
going
far
to
one
end
of
the
lake
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
returning
before
it
like
ships
and
rockwell
whose
second
skate
this
was
improves
every
minute
i
cut
rockwell
hair
four
months
growth
he
has
had
the
appearance
of
a
boy
of
the
middle
ages
with
his
hair
cut
to
a
line
above
his
eyes
now
he
truly
a
handsome
fellow
and
such
a
man
under
the
hardships
of
this
cold
place
and
rough
life
that
i
very
proud
of
him
saturday
november
sixteenth
still
it
blows
yesterday
and
cold
clear
and
blue
and
the
moon
these
nights
stands
straight
above
us
and
stays
till
dawn
setting
far
in
the
north
it
is
really
cold
olson
is
quite
miserable
and
wonders
how
we
can
keep
at
our
wood
cutting
and
skating
but
i
think
i
shall
never
live
in
such
cold
again
as
in
that
first
winter
on
monhegan
in
my
unfinished
house
when
on
cold
days
the
water
pails
four
feet
from
the
stove
froze
over
between
the
times
i
used
them
and
my
beans
at
soak
froze
one
night
on
the
lighted
stove
we
love
this
weather
here
while
the
cabin
is
drafty
i
pile
on
fuel
remorselessly
and
that
a
real
delight
after
having
all
my
life
had
truly
to
count
the
pieces
of
coal
and
wood
the
ice
on
the
pond
is
six
inches
thick
part
of
it
clear
black
that
one
can
see
the
bottom
through
this
morning
rockwell
changed
to
heavy
underwear
he
complains
always
of
the
heat
day
and
night
the
days
go
on
about
as
usual
varied
only
by
an
occasional
weekly
or
monthly
chore
and
success
or
failure
in
my
painting
this
morning
with
olson
help
i
brought
my
boat
up
onto
the
land
above
the
beach
the
boat
is
an
extremely
heavily
built
dory
with
a
heavy
keel
and
yet
the
wind
carried
it
four
feet
last
night
and
if
it
had
not
been
secured
might
have
blown
it
down
into
the
water
where
the
waves
would
soon
have
wrecked
it
this
night
i
shall
not
read
in
bed
it
quite
too
far
away
from
the
stove
sunday
november
seventeenth
we
jumped
from
bed
in
a
hurry
this
morning
believing
that
the
apparent
stillness
boded
a
calm
day
and
a
fit
one
for
the
seward
trip
but
the
sea
beyond
our
cove
was
running
swiftly
and
within
two
hours
there
was
a
gale
of
wind
and
some
snow
cold
it
was
and
dark
we
hardly
put
the
lamp
out
after
breakfast
before
we
lighted
it
again
for
late
dinner
still
in
that
short
daylight
i
painted
and
rockwell
skated
and
painted
and
we
both
cut
a
lot
of
wood
i
spent
the
evening
writing
trying
an
article
for
the
modern
school
we
turned
my
boat
over
and
secured
it
to
the
ground
with
ropes
just
in
time
to
escape
the
fall
of
snow
that
lies
deep
on
the
ground
the
moon
is
up
and
through
the
clouds
there
comes
a
general
illumination
like
daylight
monday
november
eighteenth
a
storm
from
the
southeast
it
blows
like
fury
breakfast
by
lamplight
work
until
dark
then
dinner
in
the
neighborhood
of
three
or
maybe
four
more
work
and
a
nap
for
i
felt
exhausted
rockwell
goes
to
bed
and
is
read
to
i
work
a
while
longer
then
a
light
supper
for
which
rockwell
gets
up
again
then
the
dishes
washed
and
again
in
bed
a
call
on
olson
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
leaving
there
at
ten
to
work
again
till
some
wild
hour
what
a
strangely
arranged
day
i
determined
to
have
a
clock
but
now
it
will
be
seen
that
no
more
time
must
be
spent
this
night
upon
this
diary
amen
tuesday
november
nineteenth
a
dreary
dreary
a
weary
day
but
i
worked
or
somehow
been
ceaselessly
busy
and
now
i
about
ready
for
my
nightcap
of
reading
and
bed
four
canvases
stretched
and
primed
stand
to
my
credit
and
that
alone
is
one
day
work
in
effort
and
conquered
repugnance
what
a
tedious
work
my
christmas
letters
are
written
nearly
all
of
them
and
as
christmas
draws
near
it
seems
more
and
more
impossible
without
home
and
the
children
it
will
be
a
huge
for
one
of
our
family
here
illustration
rockwell
dream
there
a
big
storm
at
sea
from
the
look
of
the
water
and
the
sound
of
the
wind
and
the
rain
falls
drearily
and
on
the
roof
it
rattles
from
the
tall
trees
the
great
drops
fall
like
stones
they
beat
to
pieces
little
by
little
the
paper
roof
and
now
when
the
rain
is
hardest
we
hear
the
drip
drip
of
the
water
on
the
floor
but
we
are
comfortable
so
what
of
it
all
i
read
big
claus
and
little
claus
to
rockwell
that
a
great
story
and
we
roared
over
it
rockwell
does
like
the
stories
about
kings
and
queens
he
says
they
always
marrying
and
that
kind
of
stuff
just
the
same
rockwell
himself
has
his
life
and
marriage
pretty
closely
planned
the
journey
from
the
east
alone
the
wife
to
be
found
at
seattle
to
save
her
carfare
and
yet
not
put
off
as
far
as
alaska
for
there
they
do
look
nice
enough
and
then
life
in
alaska
to
the
end
of
his
days
and
i
to
be
along
if
i
not
dead
as
i
probably
shall
be
he
says
i
have
just
finished
the
life
of
blake
and
am
now
reading
prose
catalogue
and
a
book
of
indian
essays
of
coomeraswamy
the
intense
and
illuminating
fervor
of
blake
i
have
just
read
this
the
human
mind
can
not
go
beyond
the
gift
of
god
the
holy
ghost
to
suppose
that
art
can
go
beyond
the
finest
specimens
of
art
that
are
now
in
the
world
is
not
knowing
what
art
is
it
is
being
blind
to
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
here
in
the
supreme
simplicity
of
life
amid
these
mountains
the
spirit
laughs
at
man
concern
with
the
form
of
art
with
new
expression
because
the
old
is
outworn
it
is
man
own
poverty
of
vision
yielding
him
nothing
so
that
to
save
himself
he
must
trick
out
in
new
garb
the
old
old
commonplaces
or
exalt
to
be
material
for
art
the
hitherto
discarded
trivialities
of
the
mind
wednesday
november
twentieth
we
hope
to
get
off
although
it
still
storms
there
a
terrific
sea
running
but
even
such
a
sea
would
trouble
us
less
than
the
chop
of
the
north
wind
the
wind
above
all
else
is
to
be
feared
here
i
painted
little
it
was
so
dark
somehow
on
these
short
days
it
is
difficult
to
accomplish
much
certain
things
to
be
done
by
daylight
the
chopping
of
wood
carrying
of
water
from
a
hundred
yards
away
lamp
filling
and
some
cooking
i
made
myself
a
lot
of
envelopes
and
the
canvases
of
yesterday
stretching
and
now
it
is
bedtime
for
we
rise
early
oh
the
porcupine
returned
and
was
discovered
feeding
calmly
near
the
cabin
he
showed
no
alarm
at
rockwell
approach
and
when
finally
after
some
hours
of
undisturbed
nibbling
and
napping
rockwell
carried
him
home
by
his
tail
and
set
him
down
a
little
distance
from
his
old
cage
he
ran
straight
there
and
interned
himself
friday
november
both
yesterday
and
are
to
be
recorded
the
porcupine
is
dead
and
yesterday
he
endeared
himself
so
to
us
playing
about
in
the
house
with
the
utmost
content
the
cause
of
his
death
we
can
not
know
unless
it
was
our
kindness
rockwell
with
olson
leather
mittens
on
did
carry
him
about
a
good
deal
of
course
they
are
creatures
nocturnal
and
we
had
planned
to
let
him
have
his
regular
hours
for
exercise
and
feeding
rockwell
delighting
in
the
plan
that
he
should
stay
with
him
in
the
woods
at
night
which
i
was
certainly
going
to
let
him
try
but
it
over
and
pet
no
has
gone
to
his
happy
hunting
grounds
it
storms
yesterday
violently
with
such
wind
and
rain
as
seemed
incredible
the
thin
paper
roof
made
the
noise
deafening
so
that
i
could
not
sleep
and
the
surf
beat
and
the
forest
roared
it
was
a
wild
night
is
better
though
it
pours
every
half
hour
when
shall
we
get
to
seward
and
here
before
me
are
displayed
all
the
pretty
christmas
presents
i
have
made
and
that
rockwell
has
made
here
we
sit
these
dark
short
days
working
together
at
the
same
table
just
like
two
professional
craftsmen
on
these
days
i
can
not
paint
and
olson
calls
upon
us
more
than
he
should
still
we
let
him
sit
here
in
silence
and
he
is
wise
enough
to
be
quite
content
now
it
is
late
the
stove
is
out
and
i
must
go
to
bed
two
meals
only
another
is
due
me
oh
i
made
myself
a
beautiful
die
for
note
paper
yesterday
and
printed
it
on
my
envelopes
illustration
the
cabin
window
saturday
november
it
dawned
calm
with
rain
hanging
in
the
air
we
hurried
with
our
breakfast
in
the
hope
that
we
should
get
off
but
within
an
hour
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
the
northwest
wind
whipped
down
from
the
mountains
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
now
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
it
still
rains
although
the
wind
has
fallen
we
felled
a
tree
and
partly
cut
it
up
although
it
was
dismally
dark
all
the
time
i
managed
to
paint
a
little
and
i
wrote
much
and
drew
in
black
and
white
rockwell
has
been
industrious
as
usual
drawing
at
my
side
he
told
me
an
amusing
anecdote
of
little
kathleen
that
is
worthy
to
go
down
here
when
in
play
she
wants
to
change
her
doll
name
she
sends
for
the
pretend
doctor
again
herself
and
he
operates
on
the
doll
cutting
a
hole
in
her
stomach
he
stuffs
into
it
a
little
piece
of
paper
on
which
he
has
written
the
new
name
and
so
the
name
is
changed
tried
some
cottonseed
oil
of
olson
that
was
too
bad
a
year
or
two
ago
he
was
given
a
case
of
spoiled
mayonnaise
dressing
for
fox
food
olson
saved
the
oil
which
had
separated
from
the
rest
of
it
i
made
dough
for
doughnuts
while
i
heated
the
oil
to
fry
ourselves
that
great
treat
then
arose
a
pinching
rancid
odor
that
almost
made
me
ill
but
which
rockwell
called
delicious
however
i
baked
the
doughnuts
still
the
oil
unheated
seemed
not
bad
sunday
november
olson
declares
this
day
to
be
sunday
and
in
honor
of
the
day
he
gave
me
a
cup
of
milk
for
junket
and
in
honor
of
the
day
whatever
it
is
i
worked
so
hard
that
now
i
tired
out
the
day
began
with
snow
and
continued
with
it
it
blustered
and
blew
much
as
a
day
in
march
and
the
bay
looked
wild
and
now
it
is
clear
and
starlight
will
the
north
wind
begin
to
blow
again
the
chances
are
that
it
will
and
seward
and
the
sending
of
my
mail
will
be
as
far
away
as
ever
i
painted
with
some
success
for
the
snow
makes
the
cabin
lighter
really
my
picture
looks
well
eight
canvases
are
far
along
so
that
i
proud
of
them
we
cut
wood
of
course
it
would
be
great
fun
if
only
we
more
minutes
of
daylight
to
spare
steamer
must
be
due
in
seward
now
we
seen
none
for
two
weeks
or
longer
monday
november
it
rages
from
the
northeast
the
bay
is
a
wild
expanse
of
breakers
they
bear
into
our
cove
and
thunder
on
the
beach
a
mad
day
and
a
wild
night
and
seward
is
as
far
off
as
ever
it
is
now
my
hope
that
a
steamer
will
go
to
seward
before
me
olson
finds
by
his
diary
that
none
has
been
seen
to
go
there
for
two
weeks
i
began
two
new
pictures
trying
for
the
first
time
to
paint
after
dark
my
lamp
is
so
inadequate
in
this
dark
interior
it
burns
only
a
inch
wick
that
i
can
work
only
in
black
and
white
but
i
laid
in
the
whole
picture
in
that
way
rockwell
spends
several
hours
a
day
exploring
the
woods
searching
out
porcupine
trails
and
caves
it
is
weeks
since
i
have
stopped
my
work
even
for
a
walk
in
this
life
i
see
little
of
it
a
blessing
to
me
to
have
to
saw
wood
every
day
illustration
go
to
bed
i
finished
coomeraswamy
indian
essays
an
illuminating
and
inspiring
book
coomeraswamy
defines
mysticism
as
a
belief
in
the
unity
of
life
the
creed
of
an
artist
concerns
us
only
when
we
mean
by
it
the
tendency
of
his
spirit
how
hard
it
is
to
speak
of
these
intangible
things
and
not
use
words
loosely
and
without
exact
meaning
i
think
that
whatever
of
the
mystic
is
in
a
man
is
essentially
inseparable
from
him
it
is
his
by
the
grace
of
god
after
all
the
qualities
by
which
all
of
us
become
known
are
those
of
which
we
are
ourselves
least
conscious
the
best
of
me
is
what
is
quite
impulsive
and
looking
at
myself
for
a
moment
with
a
critic
eye
the
forms
that
occur
in
my
art
the
gestures
the
spirit
of
the
whole
of
it
is
in
fact
nothing
but
an
exact
pictorial
record
of
my
unconscious
living
idealism
tuesday
november
after
a
terribly
stormy
and
cold
night
the
day
was
fair
with
the
wind
comfortably
settled
in
the
north
as
if
he
meant
to
stay
there
only
at
night
has
it
been
calm
again
is
so
and
if
i
had
not
rockwell
on
my
hands
to
make
me
timid
i
go
at
night
to
seward
olson
was
a
real
santa
claus
first
he
gave
us
schmier
kase
then
a
good
salt
salmon
two
years
old
which
he
said
we
better
try
and
a
lot
of
butter
churned
by
him
from
goat
milk
it
looks
like
good
butter
and
with
the
added
coloring
matter
more
palatable
than
the
natural
white
butter
of
the
goat
we
felled
two
trees
fairly
small
ones
we
consume
a
vast
amount
of
wood
with
our
fire
well
let
us
say
again
we
be
off
to
seward
wednesday
november
if
we
had
known
how
the
weather
would
turn
we
should
have
started
it
was
lovely
cold
but
fair
with
the
wind
in
the
it
had
in
the
morning
all
appearances
of
a
heavy
blow
and
we
failed
to
get
in
shape
to
take
advantage
of
its
calming
as
the
afternoon
advanced
at
any
rate
i
have
a
little
picture
of
it
with
the
soft
haze
of
the
day
and
the
loose
clouds
i
painted
besides
on
the
large
canvas
of
superman
begun
a
few
days
ago
olson
lent
me
his
to
use
a
wooden
box
of
small
grocery
size
with
a
cover
fastened
with
a
strap
and
buckle
such
a
box
is
part
of
the
outfit
of
every
man
on
the
yukon
my
emergency
grub
is
now
in
it
my
letters
christmas
presents
and
all
that
bound
for
seward
rockwell
took
squirlie
out
for
an
airing
wrapping
him
with
tender
care
in
a
sweater
they
went
for
a
long
way
into
the
woods
like
good
companions
then
rockwell
drew
a
portrait
of
his
muffled
pet
which
is
destined
for
clara
christmas
thursday
november
this
continual
waiting
is
getting
upon
my
nerves
most
of
i
spent
tinkering
with
the
engine
it
goes
now
in
a
water
barrel
the
trouble
with
the
best
of
these
little
motors
is
that
the
moment
they
get
wet
they
stop
and
they
are
attached
at
such
an
exposed
place
on
the
stern
that
they
will
get
wet
if
there
much
of
a
sea
then
you
in
a
bad
fix
for
it
impossible
to
make
any
headway
rowing
with
the
engine
or
rather
the
propeller
dragging
most
of
the
engines
are
hung
right
on
the
stern
and
can
be
readily
detached
and
drawn
into
the
boat
but
mine
fits
into
a
sort
of
pocket
built
in
the
stern
and
is
difficult
even
on
land
to
lift
out
it
weighs
decidedly
over
a
hundred
pounds
so
i
do
relish
getting
caught
with
such
an
equipment
i
must
have
mentioned
by
the
way
that
the
engine
was
thrown
in
with
the
boat
as
of
no
value
so
there
the
day
gone
we
go
to
bed
early
and
if
it
is
calm
just
before
daylight
in
the
morning
we
shall
start
at
once

friday
november
last
night
a
terrific
storm
from
the
east
a
few
blasts
struck
the
house
with
such
force
that
it
seemed
our
thin
roof
could
not
stand
it
of
course
it
is
really
quite
strong
enough
but
the
noise
of
those
sudden
squalls
bearing
along
snow
and
ice
from
the
tree
tops
is
simply
appalling
in
the
morning
it
became
milder
but
continued
to
rain
and
snow
and
for
most
of
the
day
to
blow
heavily
from
the
eastward
in
the
afternoon
to
my
despair
a
steamer
entered
for
seward
she
doubtless
leave
at
daylight
there
goes
one
of
my
chances
to
get
my
christmas
mail
off
i
painted
splendidly
and
am
in
the
seventh
heaven
over
it
which
takes
away
some
of
my
gloom
at
never
reaching
seward
a
long
call
from
olson
he
sits
here
patiently
and
silently
while
i
draw
it
snows
steadily
what
will
bring
francis
galton
the
inquirer
into
human
faculty
would
have
been
charmed
at
rockwell
casual
mention
of
the
colors
of
proper
names
they
do
apparently
assume
definite
colors
that
seem
to
him
appropriate
and
characteristic
beyond
question
clara
too
sees
names
as
colors

thursday
december
fifth
november
thirtieth
we
arose
before
daylight
it
was
a
mild
still
morning
and
the
melting
snow
dripped
from
the
trees
without
breakfast
we
set
about
at
once
to
carry
our
things
over
to
the
boat
olson
was
aroused
and
turned
out
to
help
there
always
much
to
be
carried
on
a
trip
to
seward
gasoline
oil
tools
my
pack
bag
containing
clothes
heavy
blankets
and
spare
boots
and
the
grub
box
olson
had
given
me
packed
with
mail
books
grub
and
the
flute
the
engine
was
in
good
order
and
started
promptly
so
away
we
went
out
over
the
bay
just
as
the
day
brightened
it
was
calm
and
beautiful
the
sun
from
below
the
horizon
shot
shafts
of
light
up
into
the
clouds
gray
became
pink
and
pink
grew
into
gold
until
at
last
after
an
hour
or
more
the
sun
rays
lighted
up
the
mountain
peaks
and
we
knew
that
he
had
risen
it
continued
calm
and
mild
all
the
way
but
nevertheless
i
caught
myself
singing
erlkönig
such
is
my
anxiety
at
carrying
rockwell
with
me
rockwell
enjoyed
the
trip
wrapped
up
in
a
sheepskin
coat
of
olson
we
stopped
at
a
fishing
camp
for
a
moment
chat
from
the
water
the
man
living
there
had
just
caught
a
wolverine
we
declined
breakfast
and
hurried
on
in
seward
we
stored
our
things
in
olson
cabin
a
little
place
about
eight
feet
square
and
started
for
the
hotel
one
of
our
friends
met
us
with
a
shout
well
you
had
good
sense
to
stay
away
so
long
influenza
i
then
learned
had
raged
in
seward
there
having
been
over
cases
and
smallpox
had
made
a
start
but
the
deaths
had
been
few
and
it
was
now
well
in
hand
however
i
shunned
the
hotel
a
little
cottage
was
generously
put
at
our
disposal
and
we
were
soon
comfortably
settled
there
with
our
mail
from
home
spread
before
us
i
left
everything
of
mine
at
the
hotel
untouched
and
we
continued
to
wear
our
old
clothes
throughout
the
stay
at
midnight
i
went
with
otto
boehm
to
pull
the
dory
up
above
the
tide
and
overturn
her
and
then
continued
letter
writing
until
december
first
and
every
day
of
our
stay
at
seward
was
calm
and
fair
we
kept
house
in
our
cottage
i
continually
busy
writing
and
doing
up
christmas
presents
for
a
steamer
had
entered
on
the
thirtieth
and
was
due
to
leave
sunday
night
the
first
the
people
of
seward
are
friendly
without
being
the
slightest
bit
inquisitive
and
they
are
extremely
for
all
that
their
country
is
remote
from
the
greater
world
i
do
believe
that
provincialism
is
an
inevitable
evil
of
communities
the
alaskan
is
alert
enterprising
adventurous
men
stand
on
their
own
feet
and
why
not
the
confusing
intricacy
of
modern
society
is
here
lacking
the
men
own
hands
take
the
pure
gold
from
the
rocks
no
one
is
another
master
it
a
great
land
the
best
by
far
i
have
ever
known
what
a
telltale
of
reaction
from
our
lonely
island
life
is
this
roseate
vision
of
the
little
city
of
the
far
northwest
we
came
in
time
to
see
seward
quite
differently
and
with
confidence
in
alaska
to
believe
it
to
be
in
no
way
a
typical
and
true
alaskan
town
the
new
york
of
the
pacific
as
it
is
gloriously
acclaimed
in
the
literature
of
its
chamber
of
commerce
numbers
its
citizens
perhaps
at
half
a
thousand
the
tenacious
remnant
of
the
many
more
who
years
ago
trusted
our
government
to
fulfill
its
promises
to
really
build
and
operate
a
railroad
into
the
interior
one
indignation
fires
at
the
recital
of
the
men
of
seward
wrongs
until
you
recollect
that
seward
was
built
for
speculation
not
for
industry
and
that
by
the
chance
turn
of
the
wheel
many
have
merely
reaped
loss
instead
of
profit
there
are
no
resources
at
that
spot
to
be
developed
and
there
is
consequently
no
industry
seward
is
planned
for
growth
and
equipped
for
commerce
wide
avenues
and
numbered
blocks
adorn
the
maps
where
to
the
naked
eye
the
land
a
wilderness
of
stumps
and
briars
the
center
of
the
portion
of
the
town
one
street
of
two
blocks
length
is
modern
with
electric
lights
and
concrete
pavements
the
stores
are
wonderfully
good
there
are
two
banks
and
several
small
hotels
a
baker
from
ward
bakery
in
new
york
and
a
french
barber
from
the
hotel
buckingham
there
a
good
grammar
school
a
hospital
and
churches
of
all
sorts
there
is
no
public
library
apparently
one
is
badly
missed
seward
a
tradesmen
town
and
tradesmen
views
prevail
narrow
reactionary
thought
on
modern
issues
and
a
trembling
concern
at
the
menace
of
organized
labor
a
strike
of
the
three
newsboys
of
the
seward
paper
plunged
the
poor
fool
its
printer
into
frantic
fear
of
an
plot
but
even
seward
smiled
at
the
little
man
terror
the
worst
of
seward
is
itself
the
best
is
the
strong
men
that
by
chance
are
there
or
that
pass
through
from
the
great
alaska
illustration
the
whittler
december
second
was
a
day
for
shopping
i
bought
all
manner
of
christmas
things
things
for
the
tree
things
to
eat
little
presents
for
olson
but
nothing
for
rockwell
he
and
i
must
do
without
presents
this
christmas
then
more
letters
were
written
a
wood
block
that
i
had
cut
proved
on
my
seeing
a
proof
of
it
to
be
absolutely
worthless
december
third
i
had
still
so
much
mail
and
business
to
attend
to
that
i
stayed
over
another
day
set
a
door
frame
for
brownell
and
spent
that
evening
at
his
house
the
postmaster
came
too
fine
fellow
and
we
a
great
evening
taking
turns
singing
songs
and
the
did
mighty
well
with
mishter
the
day
i
spent
writing
and
gossiping
about
town
i
heard
then
a
story
about
olson
that
worth
while
he
was
once
telling
a
crowd
of
men
about
the
reindeer
to
the
northward
among
his
listeners
was
a
jew
who
was
annoyed
with
his
hectoring
at
last
this
joker
asked
olson
if
you
bred
a
reindeer
to
a
swede
what
would
you
get
you
get
a
jew
replied
olson
the
jew
who
still
lives
in
seward
has
not
bothered
olson
since
the
old
man
has
a
rare
reputation
for
his
honesty
and
truth
and
all
round
sterling
qualities
it
truly
a
satisfaction
to
be
in
a
country
where
men
are
alert
enough
to
take
no
offense
at
alertness
where
enterprise
is
so
common
a
virtue
that
it
arouses
no
suspicion
and
where
it
is
the
rule
to
mind
your
own
business
december
fourth
we
set
about
to
leave
for
fox
island
it
took
two
hours
to
wind
up
our
final
business
in
town
and
embark
brownell
helped
with
the
boat
of
course
the
engine
balked
for
fifteen
minutes
and
then
not
of
course
went
beautifully
after
traveling
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
learned
that
rockwell
had
left
our
clock
standing
in
the
snow
by
olson
cabin
so
for
that
we
went
back
brownell
saw
us
and
brought
it
the
trip
was
swift
and
smooth
at
caine
head
it
began
to
snow
obscuring
fox
island
but
i
knew
the
course
in
the
engine
stopped
after
ten
minutes
tinkering
it
resumed
going
and
went
beautifully
till
we
rounded
the
head
of
our
cove
then
it
sputtered
and
i
had
continually
to
crank
it
however
it
carried
us
to
thirty
or
forty
feet
of
the
shore
when
it
breathed
its
last
thanks
to
the
snow
that
had
by
now
thoroughly
wet
the
engine
and
ourselves
we
unloaded
and
with
great
labor
hauled
up
the
dory
and
turned
her
over
that
night
i
was
exhausted
and
went
straight
to
bed
leaving
rockwell
at
his
drawing
so
now
we
on
fox
island
again
chapter
vii
home
thursday
december
fifth
continued
mild
rainy
snowy
sleepy
this
first
day
back
at
home
i
done
little
work
and
dared
look
at
but
one
picture
that
of
superman
and
it
appears
truly
magnificent
the
sky
of
it
is
luminous
as
with
northern
lights
and
the
figure
lives
after
all
it
is
life
which
man
sees
and
which
he
tries
to
hold
and
in
his
art
to
recreate
to
that
end
he
bends
every
resource
straining
at
what
limits
him
if
he
could
only
be
free
free
to
rise
beyond
the
limits
of
expression
into
at
his
prophetic
vision
of
man
destiny
assuming
himself
the
lineaments
of
it
in
stature
grown
gigantic
rearing
upwards
beyond
the
narrow
clouds
of
earth
into
the
unmeasured
space
of
night
his
countenance
glowing
his
arms
outstretched
in
an
embrace
of
wider
worlds
this
is
the
spirit
and
the
gesture
of
so
not
unhappy
now
work
begins
again
for
weeks
there
be
no
mail
in
seward
and
for
more
weeks
none
here
friday
december
sixth
i
reading
a
little
book
on
dürer
what
a
splendid
civilization
that
was
in
the
middle
ages
with
all
its
faults
to
men
with
my
interests
can
anything
be
more
conclusive
proof
of
the
superiority
of
that
age
to
this
than
the
position
of
the
artist
and
the
scholar
in
the
community
let
me
quote
from
dürer
diary
antwerp
a
banquet
at
the
burgomaster
hall
all
their
service
was
of
silver
and
they
had
other
splendid
ornaments
and
very
costly
meats
all
their
wives
were
there
also
and
as
i
was
being
led
to
the
table
the
company
stood
on
both
sides
as
if
they
were
leading
some
great
lord
and
there
were
among
them
men
of
very
high
position
who
all
treated
me
with
respectful
bows
and
promised
to
do
everything
in
their
power
agreeable
to
me
that
they
knew
of
and
as
i
was
sitting
there
in
such
grandeur
adrian
horebouts
the
syndic
of
antwerp
came
with
two
servants
and
presented
me
with
four
cans
of
wine
in
the
name
of
the
town
councillors
of
antwerp
and
they
had
bid
him
say
that
they
wish
thereby
to
show
their
respect
for
me
and
assure
me
of
their
good
will
wherefore
i
returned
my
humble
thanks
etc
after
that
came
master
peeter
the
town
carpenter
and
presented
me
with
two
cans
of
wine
with
the
offer
of
his
willing
services
so
when
we
had
spent
a
long
and
merry
time
together
till
late
at
night
they
accompanied
us
home
with
lanterns
in
great
honor
oh
land
of
porcelain
a
man
has
only
to
leave
all
that
by
which
we
estimate
culture
to
realize
that
all
of
his
own
civilization
goes
with
him
right
to
the
back
woods
and
lives
there
with
him
refined
and
undiminished
by
the
hardships
there
civilization
is
not
measured
by
the
poverty
or
the
wealth
of
the
few
or
of
the
millions
nor
by
monarchy
republicanism
or
even
freedom
nor
by
whether
we
work
with
hands
or
levers
but
by
the
final
fruit
of
all
of
these
that
imperishable
record
of
the
human
spirit
art
the
obituary
of
in
america
has
surely
now
been
written
in
the
poor
workshop
of
some
struggling
unknown
man
that
is
all
that
the
future
will
know
of
us
all
records
for
winds
are
broken
by
what
rages
from
the
northwest
it
piles
into
our
cove
the
windows
are
coated
with
salt
and
tons
of
flying
water
sail
in
clouds
out
of
the
bay
hiding
the
mountains
from
the
base
to
half
their
height
our
rafters
bend
beneath
the
blast
ice
from
we
know
not
where
falls
upon
us
with
a
thundering
noise
the
canvases
suspended
aloft
sway
and
flap
and
from
end
to
end
of
the
cabin
the
breeze
roves
at
will
it
so
ridiculously
bad
and
noisy
and
cold
that
rockwell
and
i
just
laugh
but
the
wood
is
plentiful
for
we
cut
some
more
illustration
get
up
last
night
at
bedtime
the
wind
had
risen
at
some
midnight
hour
the
stove
went
out
for
i
awoke
at
two
and
found
the
cold
all
about
us
and
the
wind
hard
at
it
so
with
a
generous
use
of
kerosene
the
fire
was
made
to
burn
again
and
i
returned
to
a
good
night
rest
somehow
one
does
mind
short
exposures
to
the
cold
many
a
day
i
have
stood
naked
out
in
the
wind
and
then
become
at
once
glowing
warm
again
in
the
hot
cabin
baked
bread
and
it
turned
out
very
well
painted
shivered
wrote
and
shall
try
to
design
a
picture
of
the
weird
of
the
gods
but
at
this
moment
our
supper
is
ready
and
two
hungry
cold
mortals
can
not
be
kept
from
their
corn
mush
saturday
december
seventh
late
now
that
we
have
a
clock
i
stole
one
in
seward
we
live
by
system
our
hours
are
regular
the
clock
i
set
by
the
tide
marking
the
rise
of
the
water
in
the
snow
we
rise
at
it
is
then
not
yet
sunrise
but
fairly
light
breakfast
is
soon
cooked
and
eaten
to
start
the
blood
going
hard
for
a
good
day
work
we
spring
and
chop
and
split
and
saw
in
the
glorious
icy
then
painting
begins
i
have
scared
olson
away
poor
soul
but
i
make
it
up
by
calling
on
him
just
at
dark
when
my
painting
hours
are
over
now
it
eleven
at
night
and
i
still
my
bit
to
read
whew
but
it
cold
and
the
wind
is
rising
to
a
gale
and
last
night
what
a
bitter
one
i
got
up
four
times
to
feed
the
ravenous
fire
and
even
so
the
water
pails
froze
we
can
not
afford
to
let
it
freeze
much
in
the
cabin
for
our
stores
are
all
exposed
what
if
the
christmas
cider
should
freeze
and
burst
i
painted
out
of
doors
in
sneakers
and
stood
it
just
about
as
long
as
one
would
imagine
to
love
the
cold
is
a
sign
of
youth
and
we
do
love
it
the
awakener
sunday
december
eighth
log
cabins
stuffed
with
moss
should
be
wonderful
in
the
tropics
about
frozen
on
this
work
table
i
must
weight
my
papers
down
to
keep
them
from
flying
about
the
room
and
the
wind
is
icy
it
is
bitterly
bitterly
cold
olson
says
we
need
expect
no
colder
weather
than
this
all
winter
of
course
we
do
really
mind
it
the
stove
is
red
hot
and
we
may
go
as
close
to
it
as
we
please
and
the
bed
is
warm
except
towards
morning
at
night
i
move
my
jugs
of
yeast
and
cider
toward
the
stove
fill
the
to
the
top
pile
blankets
and
wrappers
upon
the
bed
and
sleep
happily
the
gale
still
rages
fortunately
not
with
its
utmost
fury
this
morning
rockwell
and
i
hurried
through
our
chores
and
then
climbed
to
the
low
ridge
of
the
island
the
snow
in
the
woods
is
crusted
and
bore
us
up
well
so
that
we
traveled
with
ease
and
soon
reached
the
crest
ah
there
it
was
glorious
such
blue
and
gold
and
rose
we
looked
down
upon
the
spit
and
saw
the
sea
piling
upon
it
we
looked
seaward
and
saw
the
snow
blown
from
the
land
the
spray
and
the
mist
rising
in
clouds
toward
the
sun
and
the
sun
the
beautiful
sun
shone
on
us
we
took
a
number
of
pictures
and
then
with
numbed
fingers
and
toes
raced
down
the
slope
playing
rockwell
was
wonderful
to
look
at
with
his
cheeks
so
red
and
clear
he
loved
our
little
excursion
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
we
worked
i
stretched
and
coated
three
large
canvases
hateful
job
painted
sawed
wood
felled
a
tree
which
the
wind
carried
over
onto
another
so
that
there
it
hangs
neither
up
nor
down
and
that
about
all
it
again
eleven
and
time
for
bed
the
night
is
beautiful
even
if
it
is
terrible
and
the
young
moon
is
near
setting
illustration
man
monday
december
ninth
it
blows
worse
than
ever
and
it
is
colder
all
day
the
blue
sky
has
been
hidden
in
clouds
of
vapor
and
flying
spray
the
bay
seethes
and
smokes
and
huge
breakers
race
across
it
it
is
truly
bitter
weather
olson
ventured
the
prophecy
that
this
was
about
the
culmination
of
winter
but
i
know
olson
by
now
i
cut
another
tree
this
morning
to
release
the
one
of
yesterday
and
both
fell
with
a
magnificent
crash
then
we
went
to
work
with
the
saw
and
stocked
our
day
wood
olson
called
this
afternoon
and
related
his
recollection
of
the
early
days
of
nome
a
certain
man
he
began
deserted
from
a
whaler
that
stopped
for
water
on
the
north
coast
of
alaska
he
been
shanghaied
in
san
francisco
and
was
a
tailor
by
trade
he
made
his
way
down
the
coast
with
the
occasional
help
of
the
esquimaux
at
last
he
came
to
nome
the
men
were
gone
from
the
native
village
but
a
woman
took
him
in
she
was
named
english
mary
now
she
had
heard
of
the
gold
finds
on
the
yukon
and
she
asked
the
man
if
he
was
a
miner
he
answered
come
with
me
she
said
and
led
him
to
a
certain
creek
and
showed
him
the
shining
nuggets
lying
thick
upon
the
bottom
but
the
tailor
really
knew
nothing
about
gold
and
let
it
lie
he
continued
down
the
coast
and
was
at
last
carried
to
michael
there
he
met
a
missionary
and
a
young
fellow
who
had
come
to
alaska
with
a
party
of
prospectors
with
those
two
he
returned
in
a
boat
to
nome
you
hear
different
stories
to
be
sure
of
how
they
got
there
but
this
is
the
right
one
for
i
seen
the
boat
they
came
in
lying
there
off
the
beach
well
they
came
and
saw
the
gold
but
none
of
them
could
say
for
certain
what
it
was
so
one
of
them
went
off
to
get
a
man
from
the
party
of
prospectors
with
whom
the
young
fellow
had
come
to
alaska
at
last
they
got
him
there
and
he
proved
that
it
was
sure
enough
gold
they
staked
their
claims
and
began
to
work
them
but
word
of
gold
travels
fast
and
already
others
began
to
come
the
miner
of
that
first
party
drew
up
mining
laws
for
the
country
and
these
were
enforced
i
was
up
on
the
yukon
when
i
heard
of
the
first
find
at
nome
i
went
down
and
arrived
there
in
the
fall
a
little
more
than
a
year
after
the
strike
by
that
time
there
was
quite
a
number
there
some
man
had
drawn
up
a
plan
of
a
town
and
was
selling
lots
i
bought
one
on
the
northwest
corner
of
the
block
it
was
on
the
tundra
tundra
is
vegetation
covered
ice
soggy
to
a
depth
there
was
a
tent
on
my
lot
and
some
wood
so
i
bought
those
too
but
shortly
after
when
i
came
home
one
day
from
prospecting
i
found
that
both
the
tent
and
the
wood
had
been
stolen
i
bought
lumber
for
the
frame
of
a
new
tent
it
cost
me
thirty
dollars
that
is
fifty
cents
a
foot
by
that
time
all
kinds
of
people
were
pouring
into
nome
they
were
taking
out
gold
on
the
creek
those
that
had
claims
at
the
rate
of
in
a
couple
of
hours
it
was
so
heavy
in
the
sand
you
handle
a
someone
cut
into
my
tent
and
cleaned
me
out
but
i
had
nothing
much
besides
a
i
borrowed
ten
dollars
and
went
to
work
at
a
dollar
an
hour
a
couple
of
rascals
had
come
there
a
judge
and
a
lawyer
and
they
began
to
get
busy
swindling
everybody
out
of
their
titles
to
claims
it
was
said
openly
that
if
you
saw
anyone
claim
it
and
the
lawyers
would
make
more
money
for
you
than
you
could
get
out
in
gold
there
was
no
use
in
a
man
without
money
trying
to
hold
a
claim
and
the
crowd
that
was
there
gamblers
sharps
actors
men
and
women
of
every
kind
and
they
did
act
so
foolish
all
out
of
their
heads
over
the
gold
the
brothels
were
running
wide
open
and
robberies
occurred
in
the
town
by
daylight
every
man
slept
with
his
gun
beside
him
and
if
he
shot
it
was
to
kill
the
robbers
chloroformed
men
as
they
slept
in
their
tents
there
were
thousands
of
people
then
and
you
could
look
out
on
the
beach
and
see
them
swarming
like
flies
everything
was
overturned
for
gold
the
entire
beach
for
ten
miles
both
ways
from
nome
was
shoveled
off
into
the
sea
they
dug
under
the
indian
village
till
the
houses
fell
in
and
even
under
the
graveyard
illustration
woman
and
so
olson
story
continues
a
story
of
his
life
would
really
be
as
an
old
pioneer
in
seward
told
me
a
history
of
alaska
because
olson
has
never
succeeded
he
has
been
everywhere
and
tried
everything
i
have
not
done
him
justice
in
my
abridgment
of
his
nome
story
his
recollections
are
so
intimate
he
remembers
the
words
spoken
in
every
situation
and
never
no
matter
how
much
an
adventure
centers
in
himself
does
he
depart
in
what
he
tells
of
himself
from
his
character
as
i
know
him
i
would
not
have
devoted
all
of
the
time
i
have
to
this
day
entry
if
i
had
not
a
good
day
work
to
my
credit
including
the
conception
of
a
new
picture
so
vivid
that
the
doing
of
it
will
be
mere
copying
it
is
the
north
wind
surely
after
the
past
four
days
i
may
tell
with
authority
of
that
wild
prince
from
the
north
wednesday
december
eleventh
yesterday
was
too
gloomy
a
day
for
me
to
risk
a
page
in
this
journal
as
to
weather
it
was
another
fierce
one
cold
and
windy
as
to
work
accomplished
nothing
olson
in
his
cabin
on
such
a
day
is
a
treat
to
see
i
open
the
door
and
enter
there
he
sits
near
the
stove
a
black
astrakhan
cap
on
his
head
and
the
two
female
goats
in
full
possession
of
the
cabin
nanny
the
milch
goat
is
a
most
affectionate
creature
she
lays
her
head
on
olson
lap
and
as
he
scratches
her
head
her
eyes
close
in
blissful
content
see
her
pretty
little
face
says
olson
and
her
lovely
lips
certainly
the
kindest
creature
to
animals
and
to
human
ones
too
we
have
good
reason
to
know
it
is
milder
the
vapor
is
thick
on
the
bay
but
it
lies
low
upon
the
water
and
the
magnificent
mountains
sparkle
in
the
sunlight
work
has
gone
better
for
me
and
it
has
been
a
day
not
without
accomplishment
i
baked
bread
beautiful
bread
cut
wood
helped
olson
a
bit
and
had
a
glorious
with
my
son
he
a
great
fighter
i
train
him
for
the
fights
he
bound
to
have
some
day
by
letting
him
attack
me
with
all
his
strength
and
that
has
come
to
be
not
a
little
thing
friday
december
thirteenth
in
the
midst
of
letter
writing
i
stop
to
note
down
a
dramatic
cloud
effect
that
the
way
the
day
work
goes
if
i
busy
with
the
saw
or
axe
i
jump
at
once
to
my
paints
when
an
idea
comes
it
a
fine
life
and
more
and
more
i
realize
that
for
me
at
least
such
isolation
not
from
my
friends
but
from
the
unfriendly
world
is
the
only
right
life
for
me
my
energy
is
too
unrestrained
to
have
offered
to
it
the
bait
for
fight
and
play
that
the
city
holds
out
without
its
being
spent
in
absolutely
profitless
and
trivial
enterprises
and
here
what
a
haven
of
peace
almost
the
last
touch
is
added
to
its
perfection
by
the
sweet
nature
of
the
old
man
olson
i
have
never
known
such
a
man
i
no
admirer
of
the
picturesqueness
of
rustic
character
seen
close
to
it
generally
damnably
stupid
and
coarse
i
have
seen
the
working
class
from
near
at
hand
and
without
illusion
but
olson
he
has
such
tact
and
understanding
such
kindness
and
courtesy
as
put
him
outside
of
all
classes
where
true
men
belong
it
looked
like
the
picture
i
have
drawn
these
are
beautiful
days
yesterday
it
was
as
calm
in
our
little
cove
as
one
would
look
for
on
a
summer
day
the
day
was
blue
and
mild
a
day
for
work
i
made
of
my
north
wind
the
most
beautiful
picture
that
ever
was
i
stood
it
facing
outwards
in
the
doorway
and
from
far
off
it
still
showed
as
vivid
vivid
and
brilliant
than
nature
itself
the
first
time
i
taken
my
pictures
into
the
broad
light
where
they
should
be
seen
last
night
was
calm
until
four
in
the
morning
then
the
wind
again
struck
in
and
the
trees
roared
and
the
roof
creaked
and
groaned
it
was
calmer
we
began
by
felling
a
tall
spruce
more
than
two
feet
in
diameter
it
lies
now
near
the
cabin
a
great
screen
of
evergreen
its
wood
should
last
us
many
weeks
i
painted
on
two
pictures
that
bitterly
cold
work
to
crouch
down
in
the
snow
through
bent
knees
the
blood
goes
slowly
feet
are
numbed
fingers
stiffen
but
then
the
warm
cabin
is
near
this
minute
i
returned
from
splitting
wood
out
in
the
moonlight
on
days
when
painting
goes
with
spirit
the
chores
are
left
undone
if
only
it
were
possible
to
put
down
faithfully
all
of
stories
last
night
he
told
of
his
return
to
san
francisco
from
the
yukon
thirty
years
ago
how
the
little
band
of
crippled
miners
appeared
on
their
return
to
civilization
olson
was
on
crutches
from
scurvy
his
beard
and
hair
were
of
a
year
growth
all
were
in
their
working
clothes
all
bearded
brown
free
spirited
and
their
wealth
they
carried
on
them
in
bags
gold
some
to
worth
as
olson
tells
it
you
yourself
live
in
that
day
you
hear
the
german
landlady
of
the
chicago
hotel
in
san
francisco
a
motherly
woman
who
put
all
the
grub
on
the
table
at
once
so
you
could
help
yourself
say
you
boys
have
some
of
you
been
in
alaska
for
years
and
i
know
about
how
you
lived
now
that
you
back
you
must
have
a
hankering
for
some
things
tell
me
whatever
you
want
and
i
get
it
for
you
and
up
spoke
one
big
fellow
i
remember
how
my
mother
used
to
have
cabbage
i
want
you
to
get
me
one
big
head
and
cook
it
and
let
me
have
it
all
to
myself
that
night
they
went
to
the
music
halls
in
their
miners
clothes
all
as
they
were
and
drank
gallons
of
beer
and
from
the
boxes
and
the
balconies
the
girls
all
clamored
to
be
asked
to
join
them
who
were
such
free
spenders
two
days
later
they
were
paid
in
coin
for
their
gold
by
the
mint
and
all
went
to
the
tailors
and
got
them
fine
suits
of
clothes
and
so
it
continues
and
he
told
of
custer
massacre
and
of
the
sagacity
of
horses
in
leading
a
trapper
back
to
the
traps
he
set
and
maybe
lost
when
a
horse
swims
with
you
across
a
stream
guide
him
with
your
hand
on
his
neck
but
pull
not
ever
so
little
on
the
line
or
he
rear
backwards
in
the
water
and
likely
drown
himself
and
you
saturday
december
fourteenth
a
pretty
useless
day
no
work
accomplished
but
the
daily
chores
what
is
there
to
say
of
such
a
day
olson
brought
over
his
letter
to
kathleen
and
read
it
to
us
it
just
like
him
to
be
really
himself
even
at
letter
writing
the
letter
is
full
of
nice
humor
she
think
what
kind
of
an
old
fool
is
that
he
said
but
what
do
i
care
i
just
say
whatever
i
feel
like
saying
and
he
always
does
in
a
mild
way
he
lives
blake
proverb
always
speak
the
truth
and
base
men
will
avoid
you
some
people
have
found
olson
very
rough
and
illustration
foreboding
made
bread
and
stamped
about
envelopes
with
my
device
it
is
mild
and
overcast
a
light
snow
has
begun
to
fall
so
far
this
winter
the
fall
of
snow
has
been
extremely
light
it
should
bank
up
almost
to
the
cabin
eaves
my
bed
awaits
me
sunday
december
fifteenth
this
is
another
day
that
is
hardly
worth
recording
one
that
would
not
be
missed
from
a
life
it
time
something
were
again
said
about
young
rockwell
who
is
the
real
live
crowning
beauty
of
the
community
weeks
have
passed
since
i
last
recorded
his
fresh
delight
in
everything
here
it
is
the
same
for
hours
he
plays
alone
now
he
an
animal
crawling
on
all
fours
along
the
trunk
of
a
tree
that
i
have
felled
going
out
upon
its
horizontal
branches
as
the
porcupines
do
hiding
himself
in
the
foliage
and
growling
fiercely
hours
long
it
seems
while
the
foolish
goats
flee
in
terror
and
the
foxes
race
wildly
up
and
down
the
extent
of
their
corral
again
he
a
browsing
creature
eating
the
spruce
needles
with
decided
relish
doing
it
so
seriously
truly
he
lives
the
part
he
plays
when
it
is
one
of
his
beloved
wild
creatures
then
he
tears
up
and
down
the
beach
mounted
like
a
kid
on
a
stick
horse
yelling
as
loud
as
he
can
going
to
the
water
edge
and
racing
the
swell
as
it
mounts
the
slope
and
presently
i
capture
him
for
his
end
of
the
saw
at
that
he
no
longer
knows
fatigue
he
as
good
as
a
man
he
really
never
tires
and
the
work
goes
on
with
a
fine
jolly
that
makes
of
the
hardest
chore
one
of
the
day
pleasures
rockwell
is
lonely
at
times
but
if
he
tells
me
he
like
somebody
to
play
with
he
sure
to
add
in
the
same
breath
ah
well
never
mind
i
do
know
how
such
a
haphazard
education
if
continued
would
fit
him
for
participation
in
the
practical
affairs
of
life
but
i
am
convinced
that
if
all
the
little
beauties
of
spirit
that
can
now
be
seen
budding
could
be
allowed
free
clean
growth
quite
away
from
the
brutal
hand
of
mass
influences
we
have
nothing
less
than
the
full
and
perfect
flowering
of
a
human
soul
and
in
our
reachings
toward
supermanhood
none
can
do
more
here
as
an
example
is
an
achievement
of
his
imagination
that
it
is
hard
to
picture
as
surviving
long
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
large
school
rockwell
for
two
or
three
years
has
called
himself
the
mother
of
all
things
it
is
not
a
figure
of
speech
with
him
but
an
attitude
towards
life
if
it
were
the
creed
of
a
great
poet
and
it
could
be
the
discerning
critic
might
discover
it
to
be
of
the
profoundest
significance
in
modern
thought
in
little
rockwell
it
is
of
one
piece
with
his
whole
spirit
which
expresses
itself
in
his
love
for
all
animals
the
fiercest
to
the
mildest
and
for
all
growing
things
the
least
manifestation
of
that
which
is
thought
to
be
cruelty
of
boys
outrages
his
whole
nature
i
am
far
from
believing
rockwell
to
be
a
unique
example
of
childhood
i
think
that
while
cruelty
appears
uppermost
where
boys
herd
together
the
love
of
animals
is
no
less
characteristic
of
many
sensitive
children
but
of
this
i
am
certain
that
nothing
will
make
a
child
more
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
mob
child
than
this
most
perfect
and
most
beautiful
attitude
of
some
children
toward
life
in
considering
the
education
of
a
child
and
weighing
what
is
to
be
gained
or
lost
by
one
system
or
another
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
no
gain
can
outweigh
the
loss
to
a
child
of
its
loving
impulses
tuesday
december
seventeenth
once
a
miner
died
and
presently
found
his
way
to
the
gates
of
heaven
what
do
you
want
said
peter
to
come
in
of
course
what
sort
of
man
are
you
i
a
miner
well
said
peter
we
never
had
anyone
of
that
kind
here
before
so
i
suppose
you
might
as
well
come
in
but
the
miner
once
within
the
gates
fell
to
tearing
up
the
golden
streets
of
heaven
digging
ditches
and
tunnels
all
over
the
place
and
making
a
frightful
mess
of
it
all
at
last
a
second
miner
presented
himself
at
the
gates
not
on
your
life
said
peter
we
have
one
miner
here
and
we
only
wish
we
knew
some
way
to
get
rid
of
him
he
tearing
up
the
whole
place
only
let
me
in
said
the
second
miner
and
i
promise
to
get
rid
of
that
fellow
for
you
so
peter
admitted
him
this
second
miner
easily
found
the
other
who
was
hard
at
work
amid
a
shower
of
flying
earth
going
up
to
him
he
cried
in
an
undertone
partner
they
struck
gold
in
hell
the
miner
dropped
his
work
and
sprang
toward
the
gates
peter
peter
open
open
let
me
out
of
heaven
i
off
to
hell
illustration
lone
man
what
a
book
of
yarns
and
jokes
this
is
becoming
work
went
a
little
better
and
the
weather
a
little
worse
it
pours
for
the
end
of
december
it
is
wonderfully
mild
but
then
i
expect
little
really
cold
weather
here
it
is
full
moon
the
tide
is
at
its
highest
for
the
year
and
the
southeast
wind
piles
the
water
up
till
it
reaches
and
overflows
the
land
olson
expects
it
to
touch
his
house
if
the
wind
continues
tree
trunks
uprooted
somewhere
from
the
soil
monstrous
and
grotesque
grind
along
our
beach
the
water
is
full
of
driftwood
and
wreckage
wednesday
december
eighteenth
there
a
little
bucket
of
dough
that
stands
forever
on
the
shelf
behind
the
stove
sour
dough
is
made
with
yeast
flour
and
water
to
the
consistency
of
a
bread
sponge
and
then
allowed
to
stand
indefinitely
for
all
that
you
take
out
you
add
more
flour
and
water
to
what
left
in
the
bucket
and
that
shortly
is
as
fit
for
use
as
the
original
mixture
alaskans
use
it
extensively
as
the
basis
for
bread
and
hot
cakes
you
add
but
a
pinch
of
soda
and
a
little
water
to
the
proper
consistency
and
it
all
ready
for
use
the
old
time
alaskans
rejoice
in
the
honorable
title
of
sour
doughs
olson
cabin
in
seward
stands
comfortably
on
a
little
lot
in
a
quite
thickly
settled
part
of
the
town
i
wondered
at
his
affluence
in
possessing
a
house
and
lot
here
is
its
history
as
he
told
it
to
me
when
olson
first
came
to
seward
he
built
or
he
bought
already
built
a
little
cabin
standing
on
a
part
of
the
beach
now
occupied
by
the
railroad
yard
in
course
of
time
he
went
to
valdez
for
a
winter
work
returning
he
found
no
cabin
it
was
gone
from
that
spot
and
he
has
not
found
it
since
but
corporations
and
governments
are
nothing
to
olson
when
he
feels
himself
injured
he
went
to
one
official
and
said
see
here
winter
at
hand
and
i
have
no
house
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
well
they
would
see
what
could
be
done
and
in
time
referred
him
to
a
higher
authority
i
want
a
cabin
olson
said
to
this
one
if
you
do
me
the
lumber
to
build
one
with
i
have
to
steal
it
from
you
i
have
no
money
and
no
cabin
winter
is
here
and
i
certainly
going
to
live
in
a
cabin
this
winter
so
they
gave
him
an
old
shed
to
tear
down
and
use
but
told
him
not
to
build
on
the
beach
the
town
of
seward
was
laid
off
in
lots
by
the
stakes
olson
could
tell
a
lot
from
a
street
and
fair
and
square
on
a
lot
somebody
lot
he
put
his
cabin
the
owner
of
the
land
was
tolerant
and
let
it
stay
there
a
few
years
but
one
day
he
ordered
olson
house
taken
off
so
olson
carried
it
somehow
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
where
it
fitted
in
nicely
among
the
tree
stumps
well
and
good
for
a
little
time
till
in
the
summer
before
last
the
town
of
seward
improved
that
street
and
sent
a
man
and
team
to
remove
the
stumps
if
you
paid
to
remove
the
stumps
you
may
as
well
move
my
house
for
me
said
olson
where
to
asked
the
man
you
can
suit
yourself
said
olson
so
the
cabin
was
again
planted
on
a
desirable
lot
of
somebody
and
there
it
stands
neat
and
trim
with
a
little
wooden
walk
connecting
its
doorway
with
the
plank
sidewalk
of
the
street
alaska
is
to
be
sure
a
great
free
country
has
been
wonderfully
mild
and
comfortable
from
time
to
time
the
rain
has
fallen
gently
over
the
water
the
clouds
have
drooped
hiding
the
mountain
peaks
the
sea
has
been
glassy
save
for
the
long
swell
and
this
more
to
be
upon
the
beach
than
seen
rockwell
and
i
at
dusk
walked
the
shore
out
to
the
point
between
the
coves
we
saw
the
glowing
sky
where
the
sun
had
set
the
mountainous
islands
to
the
southward
and
our
own
cove
and
its
mountain
ramparts
beautiful
in
the
black
and
white
of
the
spruces
and
the
snow
if
i
but
had
my
prepared
canvas
i
make
large
studies
of
the
many
views
from
this
point
rockwell
at
dinner
begged
me
repeatedly
to
have
part
of
his
junket
besides
my
own
i
wondered
at
it
for
although
he
is
always
considerate
and
polite
this
was
almost
too
much
and
in
other
ways
i
noticed
his
alacrity
to
be
obliging
later
in
the
day
he
told
me
after
much
embarrassment
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
nicer
about
everything
and
to
do
more
for
me
and
yet
i
had
previously
found
no
fault
with
him
how
could
i
so
ends
a
day
and
again
i
think
that
in
this
country
i
would
gladly
live
for
years
chapter
viii
christmas
thursday
december
nineteenth
this
day
is
never
to
be
forgotten
so
beautiful
so
calm
so
still
with
the
earth
and
every
branch
and
tree
muffled
in
deep
feathery
snow
and
all
day
the
softest
clouds
have
drifted
lazily
over
the
heaven
shrouding
the
land
here
and
there
in
veils
of
falling
snow
while
elsewhere
or
through
the
snow
itself
the
sun
shone
golden
shadows
dazzling
peaks
fairy
tracery
of
branches
against
the
blue
summer
sea
it
was
a
day
to
live
and
work
could
be
forgotten
so
rockwell
and
i
explored
the
woods
at
first
reverently
treading
one
path
that
the
snow
about
us
might
still
lie
undisturbed
but
soon
the
cub
in
the
boy
broke
out
and
he
rolled
in
the
deepest
thickets
shook
the
trees
down
upon
himself
lay
still
in
the
snow
for
me
to
cover
him
completely
washed
his
face
till
it
was
crimson
and
wound
up
with
a
naked
i
photographed
him
standing
thus
in
the
deep
snow
at
the
water
edge
with
the
mountains
far
off
behind
him
then
he
dried
himself
at
the
roaring
fire
we
made
ready
and
felt
like
a
new
boy
if
that
can
be
imagined
we
both
sketched
for
a
little
while
in
the
morning
like
young
lady
amateurs
i
tried
it
again
two
or
three
times
throughout
the
day
with
indifferent
results
it
was
too
beautiful
we
cut
wood
too
and
that
went
with
a
zest
while
rockwell
dried
himself
after
his
bath
i
searched
in
the
woods
for
a
christmas
tree
and
cut
a
one
at
last
for
its
top
christmas
is
right
upon
us
now
the
cranberries
stew
on
the
stove
friday
december
twentieth
the
beautiful
snow
is
fast
going
under
the
falling
rain
with
only
five
more
days
before
christmas
it
is
probable
we
have
little
if
any
snow
on
the
ground
then
a
snowless
christmas
in
alaska
this
day
was
as
uneventful
as
could
be
part
of
the
morning
was
consumed
in
putting
a
new
handle
into
the
sledge
hammer
it
was
too
dark
to
paint
long
really
hardly
an
hour
of
daylight
these
days
slip
by
so
easily
and
with
so
little
accomplished
only
by
burning
midnight
oil
can
much
be
done
sunday
december
both
yesterday
and
it
has
poured
rain
they
not
been
unpleasant
days
however
occasional
have
allowed
us
to
cut
wood
and
get
water
without
inconvenience
this
morning
olson
fearing
that
a
continuance
of
the
mild
weather
would
melt
the
ice
in
the
lake
and
send
his
bags
of
fish
to
the
bottom
went
out
to
the
center
of
the
lake
where
they
hung
suspended
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
and
brought
them
in
but
so
precarious
has
the
ice
become
that
he
carried
a
rope
and
took
me
along
in
case
of
trouble
to
get
out
upon
the
ice
we
had
to
go
some
distance
along
the
lake
shore
returning
we
missed
meeting
rockwell
who
had
gone
to
join
us
not
for
some
time
did
it
occur
to
me
to
call
him
it
was
well
i
did
call
the
poor
boy
on
not
seeing
us
had
suddenly
concluded
we
were
drowned
a
strip
of
water
separated
him
from
the
ice
he
was
on
the
point
of
wading
into
this
at
the
moment
i
called
him
he
was
still
terribly
excited
when
he
reached
us
both
days
i
have
been
occupied
with
humble
housewifely
duties
baking
washing
mending
and
now
the
cabin
is
adorned
with
our
drying
clothes
here
where
water
must
be
carried
so
far
it
is
the
wet
days
that
are
wash
days
darning
is
a
wretched
nuisance
we
should
have
socks
enough
to
tide
us
over
our
stay
here
last
night
after
rockwell
had
been
put
to
bed
i
sat
down
and
did
two
of
the
best
drawings
i
have
made
at
half
past
twelve
i
finished
them
and
then
to
calm
my
elation
a
bit
for
sleep
read
in
the
odyssey
at
this
my
second
reading
of
the
book
it
as
intensely
interesting
or
more
so
than
before
as
a
story
it
is
incomparably
better
than
the
iliad
to
me
it
is
full
of
suggestions
for
wonderful
pictures
ten
days
from
now
it
comes
due
for
olson
to
go
to
seward
if
only
then
we
have
mild
calm
weather
but
as
yet
we
have
seen
no
steamer
go
to
seward
since
early
in
the
month
it
looks
as
if
the
steamship
companies
had
combined
to
deprive
alaska
of
its
christmas
mail
and
freight
in
a
policy
of
making
the
deadlock
with
the
government
over
the
mail
contracts
intolerable
meanwhile
instead
of
serving
us
the
jaunty
little
naval
cruisers
that
summered
here
in
idleness
doubtless
loaf
away
the
winter
months
in
comfortable
southern
ports
illustration
cain
monday
december
up
to
this
morning
the
hard
warm
rain
continued
and
now
the
stars
are
all
out
and
it
might
be
thought
a
night
in
spring
at
i
walked
over
in
sneakers
and
underwear
for
a
moment
call
on
olson
but
he
had
gone
to
bed
and
now
although
we
have
no
snow
the
weather
is
fair
for
christmas
if
olson
believes
as
he
says
that
christmas
will
pass
as
any
other
day
he
is
quite
wrong
the
tree
waits
to
be
set
up
and
it
will
surely
be
a
thing
of
beauty
blazing
with
its
many
candles
in
this
somber
log
interior
i
given
up
the
idea
of
dressing
olson
as
santa
claus
in
goat
wool
whiskers
santa
claus
without
presents
would
move
us
to
tears
there
are
a
few
little
gifts
a
pocketknife
and
a
kitchen
set
of
knife
fork
and
for
olson
an
old
broken
fountain
pen
for
rockwell
some
sticks
of
candy
and
the
dinner
what
shall
it
be
wait
it
is
midnight
i
just
finished
a
good
drawing
the
lamp
is
about
at
its
accustomed
low
mark
yesterday
it
had
to
be
filled
twice
those
nights
when
without
a
clock
i
sat
up
so
late
and
to
so
uncertain
an
hour
i
have
discovered
by
the
lamp
and
clock
together
to
have
been
really
long
my
bedtime
then
was
after
two
or
three
but
i
arose
later
i
finished
a
little
picture
for
olson
and
so
did
rockwell
these
were
forgotten
in
my
list
of
presents
as
i
just
written
it
i
have
shown
in
my
picture
the
king
of
the
island
himself
striding
out
to
feed
the
goats
while
billy
rearing
on
his
hind
legs
tries
to
steal
the
food
on
the
way
rockwell
picture
is
of
olson
surrounded
by
all
the
goats
in
a
more
peaceful
mood
olson
cabin
is
in
the
background
i
wish
we
had
more
to
give
the
good
old
man
at
any
rate
he
dines
with
us
christmas
eve
we
cleaned
house
stowed
everything
away
upon
shelves
and
hooks
and
in
corners
moved
even
my
easel
aside
decorated
the
roof
timbers
with
dense
hemlock
boughs
stowed
quantities
of
wood
behind
the
stove
for
there
must
be
no
work
on
that
holiday
and
now
both
rockwell
and
i
are
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
over
what
a
strange
thing
nothing
is
coming
to
us
no
change
in
any
respect
in
the
routine
of
our
lives
but
what
we
make
ourselves
and
yet
the
day
looms
so
large
and
magnificent
before
us
i
suppose
the
greatest
festivals
of
our
lives
are
those
at
which
we
dance
ourselves
you
need
nothing
from
outside
not
even
illusion
certainly
children
need
to
be
given
scarcely
an
idea
to
develop
out
of
it
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
expectation
as
real
and
thrilling
to
themselves
as
if
it
rested
upon
true
belief
well
the
tree
is
ready
cut
to
length
with
a
cross
at
the
foot
to
stand
upon
and
a
cardboard
and
star
to
hang
at
its
top
and
now
as
to
christmas
weather
this
morning
as
might
just
as
well
have
been
expected
was
again
overcast
toward
evening
light
snow
began
to
fall
it
soon
turned
to
rain
and
the
rain
now
has
settled
down
to
a
gentle
even
pace
let
it
snow
or
rain
and
grow
dark
at
midday
the
better
shall
be
our
good
christmas
cheer
within
this
is
the
true
christmas
land
the
day
be
dark
the
house
further
overshadowed
by
the
woods
tall
and
black
and
there
in
the
midst
of
that
somber
dreadful
gloom
the
christmas
tree
should
blaze
in
glory
unrivaled
by
moon
or
sun
or
star
christmas
day
on
fox
island
it
is
mild
the
ground
is
almost
bare
and
a
warm
rain
falls
first
the
christmas
tree
all
dripping
wet
is
brought
into
the
house
and
set
upon
its
feet
it
is
nine
feet
and
a
half
high
and
just
touches
the
peak
of
the
cabin
there
it
stands
and
dries
its
leaves
while
rockwell
and
i
prepare
the
feast
illustration
superman
both
stoves
are
kept
burning
and
the
open
door
lets
in
the
cool
air
everything
goes
beautifully
the
wood
burns
as
it
should
the
oven
heats
the
kettle
boils
the
beans
stew
the
bread
browns
in
the
oven
just
right
and
the
new
pudding
sauce
foams
up
as
rich
and
delicious
as
if
instead
of
the
first
it
were
the
hundredth
time
i
made
it
and
now
everything
is
ready
the
clock
stands
at
a
quarter
to
three
night
has
about
fallen
and
lamp
light
is
in
the
cabin
run
rockwell
and
play
awhile
quickly
i
stow
the
presents
about
the
tree
hang
sticks
of
candy
from
it
and
light
the
candles
rockwell
runs
for
olson
and
just
as
they
approach
the
cabin
the
door
opens
and
fairyland
is
revealed
to
them
it
is
wonderful
the
interior
of
the
cabin
is
illuminated
as
never
before
as
perhaps
no
cabin
interior
ever
was
among
these
wild
mountains
then
all
amazed
and
wondering
those
two
children
come
in
who
knows
which
is
the
more
entranced
then
olson
and
i
drink
in
deep
solemnity
a
silent
toast
and
the
old
man
says
i
give
everything
yes
everything
i
have
in
the
world
to
have
your
wife
here
now
and
the
presents
are
handed
out
for
olson
this
picture
from
rockwell
ah
he
thinks
it
wonderful
then
for
rockwell
this
book
a
surprise
from
seward
next
for
olson
a
painting
a
kitchen
set
and
a
pocketknife
by
this
time
he
quite
overcome
it
the
first
christmas
he
has
ever
had
and
rockwell
when
he
is
handed
two
old
copies
of
the
geographic
magazine
cries
in
amazement
why
i
thought
i
was
to
have
no
presents
but
he
gets
besides
a
pocketknife
and
the
broken
fountain
pen
and
sits
on
the
bed
looking
at
the
things
as
if
they
were
the
most
wonderful
of
gifts
dinner
is
now
set
upon
the
table
olson
adjusts
his
glasses
and
reads
the
formal
menu
that
lies
at
his
place
so
we
feast
and
have
a
jolly
good
time
it
is
a
true
party
and
looks
like
one
rockwell
and
i
are
in
clean
white
shirts
olson
is
magnificent
in
a
new
flannel
shirt
and
his
sunday
trousers
and
waistcoat
he
wears
a
silk
tie
and
in
it
a
gold
nugget
pin
he
is
shaven
and
clipped
about
the
ears
how
grand
he
looks
the
food
is
good
and
plentiful
the
night
is
long
only
the
christmas
candles
are
and
we
extinguish
them
to
save
them
for
another
time
finally
as
the
night
deepens
olson
leaves
us
amid
mutual
expressions
of
delight
in
each
other
friendship
and
rockwell
and
i
tumble
into
bed
the
next
day
and
the
next
it
is
mild
resting
the
weather
seems
to
be
at
this
peaceful
holiday
season
we
cut
no
wood
and
do
little
work
we
write
long
letters
both
of
us
and
consume
at
the
food
left
over
from
christmas
i
read
the
odyssey
great
story
just
now
i
am
past
that
magnificent
slaughter
of
the
wooers
else
these
delayed
pages
would
still
be
unwritten
a
few
more
odysseys
to
read
here
in
this
wild
place
and
one
could
forget
the
modern
world
and
return
in
manners
and
speech
and
thought
to
the
heroic
age
that
would
be
an
adventure
worth
trying
maybe
we
are
not
so
deeply
permeated
with
the
culture
of
that
we
could
not
throw
it
off
surely
the
spirit
of
the
heroes
strikes
home
to
our
hearts
as
we
read
of
them
in
the
ancient
books
saturday
december
for
the
first
time
in
days
the
sun
has
risen
in
a
clear
sky
and
shone
upon
the
mountains
across
from
us
it
is
colder
for
ice
has
formed
again
on
the
tub
of
water
but
there
is
a
little
wind
i
am
writing
in
preparation
for
olson
trip
he
too
is
making
ready
food
for
the
foxes
is
on
the
stove
for
many
days
feeding
his
engine
gets
a
little
burnishing
it
no
insignificant
voyage
to
seward
in
the
winter
if
only
it
holds
out
fair
and
calm
until
a
steamer
comes
there
the
hitch
now
we
have
seen
none
go
to
seward
since
the
first
of
the
month
probably
the
christmas
tree
must
come
down
the
hemlock
trimmings
shed
all
over
the
cabin
till
i
tore
them
out
last
night
we
had
our
final
lighting
of
the
tree
rockwell
and
i
stood
and
looked
in
at
it
what
a
marvelous
sight
in
the
wilderness
if
only
some
hapless
castaways
had
strayed
in
upon
us
lured
by
that
light
we
sang
christmas
carols
out
there
in
the
dark
did
a
christmas
dance
on
the
shore
and
then
came
in
and
while
the
tree
still
burned
told
each
other
stories
rockwell
story
was
about
the
adventures
of
some
children
in
the
woods
full
of
thrilling
climaxes
it
came
by
the
yard
i
told
him
of
an
indian
boy
who
longing
for
christmas
went
out
into
the
dark
woods
at
night
and
closed
his
eyes
and
how
behind
his
closed
eyes
he
found
a
world
rich
in
everything
the
other
lacked
there
was
his
christmas
tree
and
to
it
came
the
wild
animals
they
got
each
a
present
the
mother
porcupine
a
box
of
little
silken
balls
to
stick
onto
her
quills
for
decoration
and
the
father
porcupine
a
toothbrush
because
his
large
teeth
were
so
very
yellow
after
the
story
it
was
bedtime
well
this
fair
day
has
passed
and
with
the
night
have
come
clouds
and
a
cold
gloom
foreboding
snow
but
i
have
learned
to
expect
nothing
of
the
weather
but
what
it
gives
us
sunday
december
squirlie
birthday
party
squirlie
is
seated
in
a
condensed
milk
box
at
his
back
hangs
a
brown
sweater
about
him
stand
his
presents
consisting
chiefly
of
feathers
the
table
is
spread
with
the
feast
in
shells
and
the
whole
is
brilliantly
illuminated
by
a
christmas
tree
candle
long
life
to
squirlie
and
may
he
never
fall
to
pieces
nor
be
devoured
by
moths
monday
december
thirtieth
yesterday
it
rained
gently
it
pours
i
sit
here
with
the
door
open
and
the
stove
slumbering
such
weather
in
this
country
that
the
world
believes
to
be
an
iceberg
but
in
seward
and
on
the
mountains
no
doubt
it
is
snowing
enough
i
made
so
good
a
drawing
that
sitting
up
as
if
the
flight
of
time
and
the
coming
of
morning
were
no
concern
of
mine
it
is
twelve
new
year
eve
tuesday
this
is
the
tenth
anniversary
of
parents
and
i
have
kept
it
as
well
as
i
could
working
all
day
upon
a
drawing
for
his
mother
and
holding
a
kind
of
song
service
with
rockwell
rockwell
who
at
nine
years
has
every
reason
to
celebrate
however
he
may
feel
at
has
written
his
mother
a
sweet
little
letter
i
terribly
homesick
and
know
what
to
say
about
it
in
these
genial
pages
it
has
been
a
solemn
day
when
olson
was
here
i
began
from
playing
the
flute
to
sing
he
was
delighted
and
i
continued
what
a
strange
performance
here
in
the
wilderness
a
little
boy
an
old
man
listening
as
i
sing
loudly
and
solemnly
to
them
without
accompaniment
olson
brought
us
a
pan
of
goat
milk
as
he
often
does
i
make
junket
of
it
and
it
is
a
truly
delicious
dish
ever
so
much
better
than
when
made
of
cow
milk
it
resembles
a
jelly
of
pure
cream
illustration
the
north
wind
it
has
rained
hard
most
of
the
day
at
times
a
mist
has
hung
in
a
band
halfway
up
the
mountain
height
across
the
bay
it
is
a
remarkable
sight
is
as
warm
as
any
night
in
spring
or
autumn
it
thaws
continually
and
even
the
ice
that
once
covered
the
ground
beneath
the
snow
is
fast
disappearing
the
year
goes
out
without
a
steamer
having
been
seen
to
come
with
the
christmas
mail
it
is
close
to
midnight
i
have
one
secret
resolution
to
make
for
the
new
year
and
that
i
may
make
it
as
earnestly
and
as
truly
as
possible
the
stars
and
the
black
sky
shall
be
my
witness
and
so
with
the
year
nineteen
hundred
and
eighteen
i
end
this
page
chapter
ix
new
year
to
rockwell
who
asked
what
happened
on
the
new
year
that
everybody
sat
up
to
see
it
come
we
tried
hard
to
tell
all
sorts
of
yarns
about
explosions
and
rumblings
but
he
would
believe
a
bit
of
it
he
might
have
said
how
can
anything
like
that
happen
here
where
nothing
ever
comes
from
the
sky
except
rain
so
far
the
new
year
is
just
exactly
like
the
old
latter
end
but
that
it
is
more
joyous
and
the
joy
came
at
of
january
first
gliding
by
about
two
miles
out
in
the
bay
a
dazzle
of
lights
like
a
fairy
citadel
the
steamer
at
my
cry
rockwell
sat
up
in
bed
and
gazed
too
olson
unfortunately
was
in
bed
and
we
did
not
call
him
so
i
set
at
once
to
work
writing
tying
up
parcels
making
lists
until
two
of
this
morning
at
eight
we
had
olson
out
of
bed
i
hung
about
there
threatening
him
ordering
him
begging
him
to
hurry
old
men
are
hard
to
move
fast
he
shaved
standing
up
there
in
his
cabin
with
the
door
wide
open
and
the
goats
playing
about
him
i
let
him
have
a
bite
of
breakfast
but
not
much
the
dory
had
to
be
unbound
for
we
tie
them
to
the
ground
and
turned
up
and
loaded
and
launched
but
all
that
only
after
half
an
hour
cranking
of
the
engine
the
infernal
things
it
would
look
like
snow
one
minute
and
be
fair
the
next
but
it
held
fair
enough
finally
for
olson
to
get
off
and
disappear
to
our
immense
joy
he
laughs
at
our
eagerness
to
get
him
off
for
the
mail
yesterday
was
olson
day
for
celebrating
and
many
times
we
drank
to
the
new
year
together
but
i
work
to
his
disgust
still
he
understands
pretty
well
the
strange
madness
that
possesses
me
and
is
not
at
all
unsympathetic
i
explained
to
him
one
day
the
difference
between
working
to
suit
yourself
and
working
to
suit
other
people
he
defy
the
world
at
any
time
he
chose
no
matter
how
poor
his
fortunes
well
now
we
wait
for
mail
already
i
impatient
for
olson
return
and
that
can
not
well
be
before
the
day
after
rockwell
and
i
walked
around
the
bay
in
the
afternoon
more
to
have
a
look
toward
seward
where
our
mail
comes
from
than
for
anything
else
but
seward
was
hidden
in
falling
snow
all
the
bay
was
shrouded
in
mist
and
snow
but
our
own
cove
was
beautiful
to
look
back
upon
with
its
white
peaks
and
dark
forest
and
far
down
at
the
water
edge
our
tiny
cabins
from
one
of
which
the
thick
smoke
of
the
smoldering
fire
curled
upwards
sunday
january
fifth
olson
is
still
away
it
is
wearing
to
wait
this
way
in
hope
for
we
will
hope
even
if
the
wind
blows
and
the
snow
falls
and
so
it
has
done
the
day
following
olson
departure
it
was
wonderfully
fair
and
calm
but
the
next
day
it
being
the
day
he
should
have
returned
a
heavy
snowstorm
set
in
and
with
less
snow
there
was
more
wind
not
so
much
that
he
could
not
have
come
but
enough
that
he
did
we
walked
down
the
beach
and
scanned
the
bay
with
the
glasses
and
up
to
dark
i
looked
continually
for
the
little
boat
to
be
rounding
the
headland
illustration
another
of
rockwell
drawings
it
seems
as
if
that
were
all
the
news
but
the
days
have
really
been
full
of
work
and
other
interest
the
snow
itself
lying
deep
and
light
and
over
all
even
the
tree
tops
is
a
delight
rockwell
and
i
played
bear
and
hunter
tracking
each
other
in
the
woods
only
the
goats
are
miserable
these
days
with
their
browse
all
covered
but
what
they
can
gnaw
from
the
tree
trunks
billy
at
this
season
is
a
fury
one
has
really
to
go
armed
with
a
clout
yesterday
he
burst
in
the
door
of
olson
shed
and
then
inside
managed
to
shut
the
door
on
himself
when
i
investigated
the
strange
banging
that
i
been
hearing
for
some
time
i
found
him
he
had
even
piled
things
against
the
door
while
no
actual
damage
has
been
done
he
has
tossed
every
blessed
thing
about
with
his
horns
boxes
pails
sacks
of
grain
cans
rope
tools
all
lie
piled
in
confusion
about
the
floor
it
does
no
good
to
beat
the
creature
he
will
learn
nothing
it
is
about
written
more
than
i
intended
writing
my
heart
is
set
upon
the
mail
and
nothing
else
monday
january
sixth
with
olson
still
away
and
the
mail
with
him
what
can
there
be
to
report
it
snows
it
is
so
mild
that
we
walk
about
hatless
coatless
mittenless
drip
drip
drip
goes
it
from
the
eaves
continuously
the
snow
has
fallen
from
the
trees
on
the
ground
it
lies
deep
and
heavy
maybe
we
shall
take
to
snowshoes
rockwell
and
i
each
took
a
trip
along
the
beach
to
look
for
olson
as
i
stood
there
peering
into
the
haze
toward
seward
a
head
arose
from
the
water
close
to
me
it
was
a
seal
he
looked
all
about
him
for
the
greatest
while
went
under
reappeared
again
near
by
once
more
and
then
was
gone
billy
burst
open
that
shed
of
olson
again
some
day
i
shall
murder
a
goat
wednesday
january
eighth
two
more
days
and
olson
still
away
i
furious
at
him
yesterday
he
could
well
have
come
it
has
been
impossible
we
seem
to
do
little
here
but
wait
even
at
the
height
of
storm
i
found
myself
continually
going
to
the
little
window
to
look
for
a
boat
rain
and
snow
rain
and
snow
ah
if
only
we
had
our
mail
here
then
these
warm
white
days
would
be
delightful
yesterday
we
wore
our
snowshoes
for
the
first
time
but
only
to
tramp
down
the
cove
and
look
toward
seward
the
only
recompense
for
olson
absence
is
nanny
milk
i
an
expert
milker
now
and
can
do
the
job
before
she
finishes
her
cup
of
oats
i
to
for
at
the
finish
she
leaps
madly
to
escape
me
goat
milk
junket
and
orange
marmalade
sublime
friday
january
tenth
one
hour
ago
it
was
as
beautiful
a
moonlit
night
as
one
ever
beheld
the
softest
veils
of
cloud
passed
the
moon
and
cast
over
the
earth
endlessly
varied
luminous
shadows
the
mountain
tops
trees
rocks
and
all
are
covered
with
new
snow
the
valleys
and
the
lower
levels
are
black
where
rain
has
cleared
the
trees
it
is
so
beautiful
here
at
times
that
it
seems
hard
to
bear
and
now
at
this
moment
the
rain
falls
as
if
it
had
fallen
for
all
time
and
never
would
cease
oh
olson
olson
is
it
anything
to
you
in
your
old
age
to
be
so
madly
wanted
here
it
truly
is
conceivable
that
any
condition
of
bad
weather
could
visit
us
for
months
without
relief
there
seems
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
it
until
you
see
it
as
the
reverse
of
marvelously
fair
weather
a
blue
sky
is
here
as
wrong
as
rain
in
a
rainless
desert
land
nothing
has
happened
i
am
making
good
drawings
and
have
made
two
small
woodcuts
billy
again
tackled
the
door
of
olson
shed
my
fixing
of
the
lock
proved
good
that
held
while
he
burst
the
door
to
pieces
i
caught
him
at
the
finish
of
it
i
become
a
maniac
at
such
a
time
i
pursued
the
beast
with
a
club
in
a
mad
chase
through
the
heavy
snow
catching
him
often
enough
to
get
some
satisfaction
at
least
in
the
beating
i
gave
him
he
fears
me
now
and
that
something
gained
but
it
a
bad
matter
both
for
billy
and
for
me
it
is
now
after
midnight
and
i
just
finished
a
drawing
rockwell
is
concerned
about
these
late
hours
and
when
i
told
him
that
i
could
work
so
very
well
alone
at
night
he
seriously
suggested
that
i
send
him
out
in
the
daytime
to
stay
all
day
without
dinner
so
that
i
could
work
better
i
reading
about
king
arthur
and
the
round
table
to
him
that
good
for
both
of
us
he
has
made
himself
a
lance
and
a
sword
and
i
expect
to
confer
some
sort
of
knighthood
upon
him
apropos
of
the
book
of
king
arthur
rockwell
said
i
think
the
pictures
in
the
book
are
half
nice
enough
i
think
of
a
wonderful
picture
when
you
read
the
story
and
then
when
i
see
the
one
in
the
book
i
disappointed
and
these
king
arthur
pictures
are
rarely
good
in
execution
it
just
shows
that
one
need
not
attempt
to
palm
off
unimaginative
stuff
much
less
trash
on
children
the
greatest
artists
are
none
too
good
to
make
the
drawings
for
books
imagination
and
romance
in
pictures
and
stories
a
child
asks
for
above
all
and
those
qualities
in
illustration
are
the
rarest
illustration
weltschmerz
monday
january
thirteenth
of
the
three
days
that
have
again
passed
two
have
been
quite
fair
enough
for
olson
to
have
come
both
yesterday
and
rockwell
and
i
made
frequent
trips
down
the
shore
to
look
for
him
it
is
terribly
depressing
to
have
your
heart
set
upon
that
mail
that
does
come
i
begin
to
think
that
some
other
cause
than
the
weather
holds
olson
away
it
is
possible
that
the
steamer
we
saw
going
to
seward
was
no
mail
steamer
and
that
olson
who
has
gone
for
his
pension
money
is
waiting
for
a
mail
i
feel
like
making
no
record
of
these
days
i
take
pleasure
only
in
their
quick
passage
saturday
night
rockwell
received
the
order
of
knighthood
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
stayed
upon
his
knees
watching
over
his
arms
he
was
all
that
time
as
motionless
as
stone
and
as
silent
now
he
is
sir
lancelot
of
the
lake
and
jousts
all
day
with
imaginary
giants
and
wicked
knights
he
has
rescued
one
queen
for
himself
but
as
yet
none
for
me
we
have
run
about
some
on
our
snowshoes
though
the
snow
is
nowhere
deep
enough
for
that
except
along
the
shore
the
weather
is
still
mild
hardly
freezing
at
all
and
it
forever
successively
rains
snows
and
hails
all
the
animals
are
still
alive
i
do
love
them
they
rather
a
nuisance
nothing
could
be
less
amusing
than
a
blue
fox
small
creatures
excessively
timid
of
cowed
demeanor
saturday
i
had
to
get
a
bag
of
fish
from
the
lake
where
they
had
been
soaking
and
cook
up
another
great
supply
of
fox
food
wednesday
january
fifteenth
yesterday
to
begin
with
a
snowstorm
and
then
a
clear
gray
day
blue
sky
in
the
morning
a
north
wind
and
bitter
cold
gray
again
at
noon
and
mild
by
the
geological
survey
report
of
kenai
peninsular
january
should
average
in
temperature
at
seward
sixteen
degrees
from
now
on
it
must
average
close
to
zero
to
give
us
sixteen
for
the
month
here
it
not
as
cold
as
new
york
rockwell
bathed
standing
within
six
feet
of
the
open
door
i
have
definitely
decided
that
olson
stays
for
some
cause
other
than
the
weather
although
and
yesterday
he
could
not
have
come
we
snowshoed
a
bit
alaska
snowshoes
are
certainly
the
easiest
that
ever
were
to
travel
on
thursday
january
sixteenth
well
after
there
remains
no
doubt
that
olson
stays
away
purposely
unless
he
sick
or
dead
rockwell
theory
that
seward
has
been
totally
swept
away
by
a
terrible
fire
with
every
man
woman
and
child
of
its
inhabitants
i
disproved
we
walked
down
the
beach
and
there
were
the
lights
of
the
great
city
brighter
it
seemed
than
ever
either
there
has
been
no
mail
boat
at
all
since
early
in
december
or
there
has
been
no
mail
from
juneau
whence
as
he
calls
it
comes
well
it
profits
us
nothing
to
speculate
on
this
the
day
has
been
glorious
mild
fair
with
snow
everywhere
even
on
the
trees
the
snow
sticks
to
the
mountain
tops
even
to
the
steepest
barest
peaks
painting
them
all
a
spotless
dazzling
white
it
a
marvelous
sight
rockwell
and
i
journeyed
around
the
point
and
saw
the
sun
again
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
i
snowshoed
around
the
cove
there
never
was
so
beautiful
a
land
as
this
now
at
midnight
the
moon
is
overhead
our
clearing
seems
as
bright
as
day
and
the
shadows
are
so
dark
from
the
little
window
the
lamplight
shines
out
through
the
fringe
of
icicles
along
the
eaves
and
they
glisten
like
diamonds
and
in
the
still
air
the
smoke
ascends
straight
up
into
the
blue
night

victory
saturday
january
eighteenth
two
beautiful
days
these
last
and
the
wind
blows
and
the
snow
falls
and
it
is
very
cold
the
days
are
uneventful
we
journey
many
times
down
the
beach
over
our
snowshoe
trail
that
our
diversion
to
look
up
the
bay
toward
seward
but
the
view
is
beautiful
loftier
mountains
more
volcano
shaped
are
about
seward
and
they
dazzling
white
yesterday
rockwell
found
otter
tracks
crossing
from
the
salt
water
to
the
lake
a
lot
of
them
it
wonderful
to
think
that
those
fine
creatures
have
crossed
the
five
long
miles
of
water
their
footprints
are
as
large
as
a
dog
they
seem
to
have
a
great
time
frisking
about
as
they
travel
on
one
little
slope
they
have
made
a
slide
no
footprints
are
there
at
all
only
the
smoothly
worn
track
we
see
no
wild
life
as
a
rule
but
the
eagles
they
all
about
in
plenty
magnificent
birds
when
seen
close
to
and
when
flying
at
the
mountain
height
still
surprisingly
large
the
milk
goat
is
dry
so
that
one
chore
less
rockwell
feeds
the
goats
every
day
but
i
ca
trust
him
with
the
foxes
he
leave
the
door
open
as
likely
as
not
it
was
reserved
for
olson

to

happen

rockwell
spends
most
of
his
time
being
sir
lancelot
still
delights
him
and
there
not
a
stump
in
the
vicinity
that
has
not
been
scarred
by
his
attacks
with
lance
and
sword
these
stumps
are
really
mostly
all
giants
i
am
now
reading
the
department
of
agriculture
year
book
very
instructive
tuesday
january
the
north
wind
rages
it
is
cold
and
clear
starlight
with
the
violent
the
snow
sweeps
by
in
except
for
what
sweeps
over
my
work
table
it
descends
in
a
fine
wet
spray
so
that
i
had
to
cover
that
place
with
canvas
and
work
elsewhere
a
wild
day
it
has
been
and
a
wild
night
is
before
us
and
yesterday
was
little
brother
to
it
these
days
are
wonderful
but
they
are
terrible
it
is
thrilling
now
with
olson
absent
to
reflect
that
we
are
absolutely
cut
off
from
all
mankind
that
we
can
not
in
this
raging
sea
return
to
the
world
nor
the
world
come
to
us
barriers
must
secure
your
isolation
in
order
that
you
may
experience
the
full
significance
of
it
the
romance
of
an
adventure
hangs
upon
slender
threads
a
banana
peeling
on
a
mountain
top
tames
the
wilderness
much
of
the
glory
of
this
alaska
is
in
the
knowledge
i
have
that
the
next
bay
which
i
may
never
choose
to
enter
is
uninhabited
that
beyond
those
mountains
across
the
water
is
a
vast
region
that
no
man
has
ever
trodden
a
terrible
wilderness
we
begin
to
think
less
of
olson
return
i
have
settled
to
my
work
and
can
imagine
things
continuing
as
they
are
for
weeks
they
continue
so
unless
the
wind
forsakes
the
north
two
days
ago
after
a
very
cold
night
we
awoke
to
thunder
and
lightning
and
snow
in
two
hours
the
sun
was
out
that
afternoon
i
stripped
and
danced
awhile
in
the
snow
a
while
then
after
a
hot
bath
out
again
in
my
nakedness
for
a
roll
in
the
snow
dressed
and
felt
a
new
man
rockwell
loves
it
all
more
and
more
he
seems
absolutely
contented
and
spends
hours
a
day
outdoors
what
a
marvel
is
a
child
imagination
it
is
a
treat
for
rockwell
to
play
at
bedtime
and
attack
me
furiously
and
if
at
any
time
i
just
enter
his
it
all
he
can
wish
for
another
filthy
mess
of
has
been
prepared
and
a
new
sack
of
salt
fish
put
to
soak
in
the
lake
i
do
hate
that
chore
pioneering
i
relish
ranching
i
despise
at
least
blue
fox
ranching
the
miserable
things
slink
about
so
in
such
sick
and
mean
spirited
fashion
thursday
january
sometimes
the
smoke
goes
up
the
flue
and
sometimes
down
and
not
good
for
the
fire
i
sit
within
six
inches
of
the
stove
with
a
frozen
nose
and
icy
feet
the
wind
sifts
through
the
walls
now
with
our
moss
calking
shrunken
and
dried
and
shriveled
further
with
the
cold
our
cabin
would
be
light
without
windows
these
are
so
far
the
coldest
days
of
winter
although
it
blows
straight
from
the
north
whence
only
fair
weather
comes
the
day
is
dark
with
drifting
snow
cloud
high
the
water
of
the
bay
is
hidden
in
driving
vapor
we
cut
wood
and
stuff
it
everlastingly
into
the
stove
seventy
pieces
for
the
ravenous
big
chunks
have
been
cut
and
split
and
we
cut
again
but
with
all
the
trouble
of
cold
weather
we
be
mightily
disappointed
if
the
winter
slipped
by
without
it
it
a
real
satisfaction
to
find
that
my
calculations
in
supplies
in
bedding
in
heating
equipment
were
just
right
for
conditions
here
we
running
low
now
in
cereals
and
milk
but
we
had
planned
to
visit
seward
this
month
to
restock
olson
absence
is
quite
outside
of
all
plans
if
he
is
sick
it
hard
to
explain
reasonably
in
any
way
for
the
past
three
weeks
i
have
made
on
an
average
no
less
than
one
good
drawing
a
day
really
drawings
i
delighted
with
i
struck
a
fine
stride
and
moreover
a
good
system
for
my
work
here
to
continue
upon
during
the
day
i
paint
from
nature
by
way
of
fixing
the
forms
and
above
all
the
color
of
the
in
my
mind
then
after
dark
i
go
into
a
trance
for
a
while
with
rockwell
subdued
into
absolute
silence
i
lie
down
or
sit
with
closed
eyes
until
i
see
a
composition
then
i
make
a
quick
note
of
it
or
maybe
give
an
hour
time
to
perfecting
the
arrangement
on
a
small
scale
then
when
that
done
i
care
free
rockwell
and
i
play
cards
for
half
an
hour
i
get
supper
he
goes
to
bed
when
he
naked
i
get
him
to
pose
for
me
in
some
needed
fantastic
position
and
make
a
note
of
the
anatomy
in
the
gesture
of
my
contemplated
drawing
little
rockwell
tender
form
is
my
model
perhaps
for
some
huge
hairy
ruffian
it
a
great
joke
how
i
use
him
generally
i
have
to
feel
for
the
bone
or
tendon
that
i
want
to
place
correctly
illustration
zarathustra
and
his
playmates
last
night
i
drew
laughing
to
myself
a
lion
was
my
subject
i
have
often
envied
blake
and
some
of
the
old
masters
their
of
certain
forms
that
let
them
be
at
times
so
delightfully
impressively
naïve
i
thought
it
matters
not
a
bit
how
little
you
know
about
the
living
form
provided
you
proceed
to
draw
the
thing
according
to
some
definite
consistent
idea
do
conceal
your
ignorance
with
a
slur
be
definite
and
precise
even
there
well
by
golly
this
lion
gave
me
my
chance
to
be
unsophisticated
such
a
silly
smirking
beast
as
i
drew
at
last
it
became
somewhat
rational
and
a
little
dignified
but
it
still
looks
like
a
judge
in
a
great
wig
but
a
lion
that
lets
a
naked
youth
sleep
in
his
paws
as
this
one
does
may
be
expected
to
be
a
little
unbeastly
when
i
began
to
write
these
pages
the
stars
were
out
now
it
snows
or
hails
on
the
roof
saturday
january
it
is
bitterly
cold
weather
as
cold
continuously
as
i
ever
experienced
both
yesterday
and
the
wind
has
been
exceptionally
violent
and
the
air
full
of
flying
snow
both
of
olson
water
barrels
in
the
house
have
frozen
solid
one
bulged
and
burst
the
bottom
rolling
itself
off
onto
the
floor
sunday
january
a
day
of
hard
work
with
rockwell
in
bed
for
a
change
just
a
little
stomach
upset
and
he
all
right
now
felled
a
tree
and
cut
up
fifteen
feet
of
it
taking
advantage
of
this
glorious
day
it
was
much
milder
than
for
days
it
has
been
and
it
still
holds
so
there
no
wind
and
that
makes
ever
so
much
difference
in
the
cabin
now
if
it
will
hold
calm
and
mild
for
a
day
we
see
whether
or
not
olson
is
yet
ready
to
return
tuesday
january
i
reading
zarathustra
write
with
blood
and
thou
wilt
learn
that
blood
is
spirit
so
that
book
was
written
last
night
i
made
a
drawing
of
zarathustra
leading
the
ugliest
man
by
the
hand
out
into
the
night
to
behold
the
round
moon
and
the
silver
waterfall
what
a
book
to
illustrate
the
translator
of
it
says
that
zarathustra
is
such
a
being
as
nietzsche
would
have
liked
himself
to
be
in
other
words
his
ideal
man
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ideal
of
a
man
the
real
man
you
that
which
in
your
soul
you
choose
to
be
your
most
beautiful
and
cherished
vision
is
yourself
what
are
the
true
normal
conditions
of
life
for
any
man
but
just
those
perfect
conditions
with
which
he
would
ideally
surround
himself
a
man
is
not
a
sum
of
discordant
tendencies
but
rather
a
being
perfect
for
one
special
place
and
this
is
olson
creed
my
chief
criticism
of
zarathustra
is
his
taste
for
propaganda
why
after
all
concern
himself
with
the
mob
in
picturing
his
hero
as
a
teacher
has
not
nietzsche
been
tricked
away
from
a
true
ideal
to
an
historical
one
of
necessity
the
great
figures
of
all
time
have
gone
down
to
oblivion
it
the
will
of
human
society
that
only
the
benefactors
of
mankind
shall
be
cherished
in
memory
a
pure
ideal
is
to
be
the
thing
yourself
concerning
yourself
no
bit
with
proving
it
and
if
the
onward
path
of
mankind
seems
to
go
another
way
than
yours
proud
soul
let
it
illustration
frozen
fall
wednesday
january
alaska
be
cold
monday
broke
all
records
for
the
winter
tuesday
made
that
seem
balmy
it
was
so
bitterly
cold
here
last
night
in
our
tight
little
cabin
that
we
had
to
laugh
until
ten
when
i
went
to
bed
the
large
stove
was
continuously
red
hot
and
running
at
full
blast
and
yet
by
then
the
water
pails
were
frozen
two
inches
thick
but
ten
feet
from
the
stove
and
open
water
at
supper
time
my
fountain
pen
was
frozen
on
the
table
rockwell
required
a
hot
water
bottle
in
bed
the
fox
food
was
solid
ice
my
paste
was
frozen
and
that
all
my
potatoes
and
milk
i
had
stood
near
the
stove
at
twelve
the
clock
again
from
the
warmth
of
breakfast
cooking
i
put
the
water
pail
at
night
behind
the
stove
close
to
it
and
yet
it
was
solid
in
the
morning
we
burn
an
unbelievable
amount
of
wood
at
least
a
cord
a
week
in
one
stove
so
i
figure
we
earn
a
dollar
a
day
cutting
wood
we
felled
another
tree
and
cut
most
of
it
up
still
we
manage
to
gain
steadily
with
our
wood
pile
always
in
anticipation
of
worse
weather
last
night
at
sundown
the
bay
appeared
indescribably
dramatic
dense
clouds
of
vapor
were
rising
from
the
water
obscuring
all
but
a
few
peaks
of
the
mountains
and
darkening
the
bay
but
above
the
sun
shone
dazzlingly
on
the
peaks
and
through
the
thinner
vapor
coloring
this
like
flames
it
was
as
if
a
terrible
fire
raged
over
the
bay
this
morning
for
hours
it
was
dark
from
clouds
of
vapor
they
swept
in
over
our
land
and
coated
the
trees
of
the
shore
with
white
frost
yesterday
i
had
to
go
to
the
lake
and
chop
out
a
bag
of
fish
for
the
foxes
i
returned
covered
with
ice
and
the
fish
were
frozen
solid
before
i
reached
the
cabin
i
cut
them
up
with
the
axe
and
cooked
a
week
supply
of
food
for
the
foxes
rockwell
has
been
a
trump
the
weather
ca
be
too
cold
for
him
this
morning
he
pulled
his
end
of
the
saw
without
rest
he
rarely
goes
out
now
without
his
horse
lance
and
sword
and
he
addresses
me
always
as
my
lord
surely
lancelot
himself
was
no
gentler
knight
and
now
bedtime
the
cold
is
less
than
last
night
but
still
i
sit
huddled
at
the
stove
it
is
the
bitter
wind
that
makes
the
trouble
thursday
january
thirtieth
a
splendid
day
of
wood
cutting
it
was
milder
and
quite
windless
in
our
cove
although
in
the
bay
there
were
whitecaps
a
light
snow
had
begun
to
fall
by
noon
and
it
continues
to
increase
our
lead
on
the
weather
we
set
to
work
upon
a
inch
tree
we
had
to
throw
it
somewhat
against
its
natural
lean
and
it
was
a
terrible
job
the
wedge
would
not
enter
the
frozen
tree
and
when
it
at
last
did
it
would
lift
the
great
mass
that
rested
on
it
only
after
an
continuous
pounding
with
the
heavy
did
i
drive
the
wedge
in
clear
to
the
head
and
then
the
great
tree
fell
the
fall
of
one
of
these
monsters
for
to
us
they
seem
gigantic
is
thrilling
this
one
went
straight
where
we
had
aimed
it
down
a
narrow
avenue
in
the
woods
ripping
and
crashing
it
fell
carrying
down
a
smaller
tree
with
its
limbs
then
rockwell
and
i
set
to
work
with
the
saw
when
the
drums
were
split
we
hauled
them
to
the
cabin
on
olson
yukon
sled
and
now
our
wood
pile
is
a
joyous
sight
while
within
the
cabin
we
have
a
whole
cold
day
supply
last
night
just
as
i
was
going
to
bed
rockwell
began
to
talk
in
his
sleep
about
some
wild
adventure
with
his
imaginary
savages
i
asked
him
if
he
were
cold
no
my
lord
he
murmured
and
slept
on
very
fine
barley
soup
water
in
which
barley
had
been
boiled
two
bouillon
cubes
onions
browned
in
bacon
fat
rockwell
said
it
was
the
best
yet
saturday
february
first
again
the
days
are
like
spring
yesterday
began
the
thaw
and
today
continues
it
with
rain
most
of
the
time
so
we
stayed
within
doors
sir
lancelot
and
my
lordship
working
here
at
our
craft
i
have
just
completed
my
second
drawing
for
the
day
one
a
day
has
been
the
rate
for
a
month
but
yesterday
the
spirit
did
work
but
the
news
a
great
old
tramp
steamer
entered
yesterday
that
must
carry
mail
and
freight
and
send
olson
back
to
us
if
only
it
were
a
regular
liner
i
know
for
sure
it
is
possible
this
steamer
has
been
chartered
to
relieve
the
situation
well
the
next
fair
calm
day
will
show
illustration
the
hermit
sunday
february
second
it
before
supper
rockwell
who
has
just
run
for
a
romp
calls
at
this
moment
that
he
has
lost
his
slipper
in
the
snow
and
is
barefooted
is
to
us
like
another
room
mornings
we
wash
in
the
snow
invariably
and
with
a
mug
of
water
in
hand
clean
our
teeth
out
there
and
this
in
the
coldest
weather
we
scour
our
pots
with
snow
before
washing
them
throw
the
dish
water
right
out
of
the
door
and
generally
are
in
and
out
all
day
it
is
surely
nonsense
to
think
that
changes
of
temperature
give
men
colds
neither
of
us
has
had
a
trace
of
a
cold
this
winter
we
have
even
used
handkerchiefs
only
sleeves
nor
does
it
give
one
a
cold
to
cold
i
tried
that
often
enough
to
know
and
a
variable
climate
has
too
nothing
to
do
with
it
for
what
variableness
could
exceed
an
alaska
winter
colds
like
bad
temper
and
loss
of
faith
are
a
malady
of
the
city
crowd
it
rains
this
moment
the
next
it
will
hail
and
then
snow
sometime
the
sun
has
shone
sometime
the
wind
has
blown
and
for
the
rest
been
calm
altogether
it
has
been
too
uncertain
for
us
to
expect
olson
and
now
for
the
hot
cakes
and
supper
for
rockwell
barley
the
marrow
of
men
rockwell
asked
me
how
kings
earned
their
living
i
said
they
did
earn
it
just
got
the
people
to
give
it
to
them
what
that
he
said
laughing
some
sort
of
a
joke
they
play
on
the
people
so
i
guess
it
takes
education
to
appreciate
privilege
incidentally
the
war
must
be
over
and
the
heroes
having
proved
by
their
might
that
might
does
make
right
or
that
it
does
now
have
doffed
the
soldier
uniform
of
glory
for
the
clothes
of
toil
monday
february
third
we
are
in
the
second
month
of
olson
absence
it
stormed
mostly
heavy
snow
in
the
morning
through
the
thick
of
it
we
heard
faintly
a
steamer
whistle
it
seemed
to
be
receding
outward
bound
at
four
while
a
light
snow
fell
the
lightning
played
merrily
and
thunder
crashed
it
is
like
this
snow
for
half
an
hour
then
rain
silence
and
calm
for
a
few
minutes
suddenly
huge
hailstones
pelt
the
roof
for
all
the
world
like
rocks
this
lasts
a
few
seconds
there
a
fierce
gust
of
wind
showering
ice
and
snow
from
the
tree
tops
down
upon
us
again
calm
and
silence
and
the
performance
is
ready
to
begin
again
tuesday
february
fourth
it
has
been
so
changeable
that
we
are
still
uncertain
of
olson
intentions
we
snowshoed
down
the
beach
in
the
beautiful
soft
new
snow
so
at
least
to
have
a
look
toward
seward
there
lay
the
bay
calm
and
beautiful
and
spotless
the
scale
of
things
is
so
tremendous
here
that
i
little
idea
how
far
we
shall
be
able
to
see
the
little
bobbing
boat
when
it
does
come
we
sawed
a
lot
of
wood
bringing
our
pile
clear
up
into
the
gable
peak
it
becomes
a
mania
seeing
the
pile
grow
in
quiet
weather
we
cut
to
forestall
the
storm
in
the
storm
we
still
cut
to
be
well
ahead
for
days
that
may
be
worse
it
is
beautifully
mild
now
on
february
first
rockwell
brought
in
some
budding
twigs
the
alders
all
seem
to
be
in
bud
and
some
charming
shrubs
as
well
it
is
midnight
and
past
my
drawing
is
finished
the
stove
is
piled
for
the
night
cereal
and
beans
in
place
upon
it
so
illustration
ecstasy
wednesday
february
fifth
a
beautiful
snowstorm
all
the
day
and
still
and
mild
rockwell
has
been
out
in
it
all
day
dressed
in
my
overalls
and
mittens
he
plays
seal
and
swims
in
the
deep
snow
we
built
a
snow
house
together
it
is
now
about
seven
feet
in
diameter
inside
and
as
cozy
as
can
be
i
sure
rockwell
will
want
to
sleep
there
when
finished
a
curtain
of
icicles
hangs
before
our
little
window
i
have
carefully
figured
the
cost
of
our
living
here
from
the
food
bills
all
of
which
i
have
kept
i
have
bought
worth
of
provisions
i
still
have
on
hand
worth
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
days
it
has
cost
us
cents
a
day
for
two
or
cents
each
a
little
over
ten
cents
a
meal
this
for
the
current
high
prices
everywhere
and
additionally
high
in
alaska
seems
very
reasonable
living
the
figures
include
the
very
expensive
christmas
luxuries
friday
february
seventh
yesterday
the
sun
for
how
many
days
he
might
have
been
shining
at
us
i
do
know
for
it
has
been
cloudy
however
at
noon
it
was
all
over
the
ground
about
us
and
shining
in
at
my
window
what
a
joyous
sight
after
months
of
shadow
the
sun
at
setting
again
almost
reached
us
and
yesterday
as
if
spring
had
already
come
we
begin
the
day
with
snow
baths
at
sunrise
ha
that
the
real
morning
bath
and
again
we
step
and
plunge
full
length
into
the
deep
snow
scour
our
bodies
with
it
and
rush
back
into
the
sheltering
house
and
the
stove
to
rockwell
belongs
all
credit
or
blame
for
this
madness
he
do
it
and
i
ashamed
not
to
follow
these
two
days
have
been
cold
and
windy
north
days
but
how
beautiful
all
of
the
day
rockwell
plays
swimming
in
the
deep
snow
now
a
seal
again
a
walrus
gee
he
the
great
fellow
for
northern
weather
cooked
the
filthy
fox
mess
yesterday
washed
clothes
sawed
wood
on
both
now
it
at
night
and
tired
saturday
february
eighth
all
about
me
stand
the
drawings
of
my
series
the
mad
hermit
they
look
mighty
fine
to
me
myself
with
whiskers
and
hair
first
when
the
storm
abated
a
bit
we
sank
a
bag
of
fish
in
the
lake
and
then
started
on
snowshoes
for
the
ridge
to
the
eastward
the
snow
lay
in
the
woods
there
heavy
and
deep
no
breath
of
wind
had
touched
it
the
small
trees
loaded
bent
double
making
shapes
like
frozen
fountains
some
little
trees
with
their
branches
starting
far
from
the
ground
formed
with
their
drooping
limbs
domed
chambers
about
their
stems
coming
down
it
was
great
sport
we
could
slide
down
even
in
our
sticky
snowshoes
rockwell
who
was
soaked
through
undressed
and
spent
the
afternoon
naked
playing
wild
animal
about
the
cabin
then
at
we
both
had
hot
baths
and
snow
baths
following
i
begin
to
relish
the
snow
bath
rockwell
was
the
picture
of
health
and
beauty
afterwards
with
his
cheeks
and
blue
eyes
monday
february
tenth
yesterday
morning
i
bathed
in
a
snowstorm
this
morning
it
was
too
terribly
howlingly
blusterous
to
run
out
into
it
and
now
since
one
it
is
as
calm
and
mild
as
it
ever
could
be
within
the
cabin
it
even
more
cozy
than
usual
the
snow
is
banked
up
against
the
big
window
to
a
third
the
window
height
by
day
the
light
seems
curtained
by
night
doubly
bright
from
reflected
lamplight
heavy
drifts
are
everywhere
last
night
fine
snow
filtered
in
upon
our
faces
as
we
slept
but
not
enough
to
be
uncomfortable
the
cabin
is
fortunately
placed
as
to
drifts
and
our
remains
clear
with
a
splendid
bathing
bank
skirting
it
rockwell
is
at
work
now
upon
multiplication
tables
he
a
real
student
and
is
always
seriously
occupied
with
something
in
his
hours
indoors
chapter
x
olson
he
returned
last
night
the
eleventh
of
february
in
a
blaze
of
glory
ah
the
wonder
of
it
and
of
all
he
brought
rockwell
and
i
sat
at
our
cards
just
before
the
day
a
calm
one
a
fair
one
had
passed
and
olson
again
had
not
come
we
were
downcast
every
possible
cause
for
his
continued
absence
had
been
reviewed
in
my
mind
to
wait
longer
was
not
to
be
endured
and
so
we
sat
with
thoughts
and
toyed
with
the
silly
cards
suddenly
the
long
clear
sound
of
a
horn
reached
us
from
the
night
outdoors
we
ran
and
peered
into
the
darkness
at
last
we
saw
a
black
spot
moving
far
out
on
the
water
oh
god
it
was
entering
the
cove
in
what
a
frenzy
of
excitement
we
hurried
down
the
beach
nearer
they
come
and
nearer
men
voices
the
little
cabin
light
and
the
vessel
gliding
toward
us
they
abreast
of
us
they
drop
anchor
olson
olson
i
shout
olson
is
that
you
he
aboard
is
answered
how
are
you
and
how
the
little
boy
we
see
them
loading
a
dory
from
the
vessel
deck
and
now
they
row
it
to
the
shore
it
good
to
see
a
fine
young
fisherman
and
shake
his
hand
again
and
once
again
the
loads
are
ferried
in
and
carried
up
the
long
and
slippery
beach
rockwell
has
lighted
lamp
he
sweeps
his
cabin
and
starts
the
fire
in
the
stove
at
the
last
load
i
slip
aboard
the
vessel
i
am
there
stands
olson
swaying
gigantic
on
the
deck
above
us
as
we
bump
the
side
a
bear
greeting
olson
is
radiant
radiant
and
mellow
with
the
joy
of
homecoming
and
the
warmth
of
tasted
spirits
the
skipper
i
know
yes
the
good
englishman
hogg
who
had
us
once
to
dinner
at
his
camp
down
in
the
cabin
in
the
heat
and
fumes
of
a
cooking
feast
we
tip
the
friendly
bottle
ah
tell
me
not
abstainer
of
any
glories
you
have
known
one
night
one
midnight
out
on
the
black
waters
of
a
newfoundland
harbor
the
million
stars
above
and
on
the
wretched
vessel
deck
the
hoard
of
men
saying
their
passionate
farewells
on
the
dull
plain
of
their
life
a
flash
of
lightning
revealing
an
abyss
this
night
on
the
still
dark
cove
of
resurrection
bay
rimmed
with
wild
mountains
and
the
wilderness
strong
men
about
you
mad
loosened
speech
and
winged
prophetic
vision
god
but
sane
daylight
seeing
seems
to
touch
but
the
white
hard
surface
of
where
life
is
hidden
from
the
hot
cabin
i
climbed
the
boat
ladder
up
up
onto
the
world
heights
ah
how
the
cold
clean
wind
from
the
wide
spaces
then
swept
my
soul
and
how
close
about
my
head
the
dome
of
heaven
and
the
stars
this
is
no
but
the
deck
of
a
meteor
vessel
that
i
tread
the
moon
ship
of
the
ancient
northern
gods
i
row
ashore
for
rockwell
stow
the
goods
higher
on
the
beach
and
we
return
aboard
for
supper
over
rockwell
the
skipper
makes
a
great
fuss
says
he
a
famous
oarsman
and
could
beat
his
daddy
a
fine
big
strong
boy
warm
hearted
skipper
and
he
reaches
again
for
the
bottle
and
i
drink
it
profuse
apologies
and
the
right
one
is
found
we
eat
we
stuff
and
then
the
three
of
us
rockwell
laden
with
presents
of
fruit
say
and
row
ashore
poor
tired
olson
has
little
strength
to
move
the
heavy
loads
from
the
beach
no
matter
i
struggle
alone
and
finally
stow
them
in
his
cabin
a
great
pile
then
a
cup
of
coffee
with
the
old
man
a
little
furious
talk
about
the
war
fury
at
a
world
that
could
mess
things
so
and
home
to
bed
where
already
rockwell
slept
this
morning
the
icy
bath
then
without
breakfast
we
began
upon
our
mail
what
a
wonderful
christmas
at
last
the
bed
was
piled
high
with
presents
the
table
high
with
letters
we
sorted
and
gloated
like
hungry
tigers
that
in
the
ecstasy
of
possession
merely
lick
their
food
all
through
the
morning
and
deep
into
the
afternoon
i
read
the
mail
unwashed
dishes
stood
about
for
meals
we
but
ate
what
was
at
hand
here
follows
in
the
journal
a
list
two
pages
long
of
presents
of
books
what
a
shelf
of
them
woolen
clothes
and
sheepskin
slippers
music
for
the
flute
candy
chocolate
cigarettes
and
ever
so
much
more
and
that
being
about
seven
times
as
much
as
we
ever
had
before
is
all
ah
in
the
wilderness
you
love
your
friends
and
they
too
think
of
you
better
than
all
though
are
the
letters
such
friendly
letters
never
were
before
friday
february
fourteenth
the
days
go
like
the
wind
so
warm
and
yesterday
we
live
now
as
i
write
the
door
stands
open
and
the
soft
moist
spring
air
enters
to
dispel
the
fumes
of
turpentine
i
primed
eight
canvases
six
of
which
i
had
also
stretched
this
afternoon
i
painted
at
the
northern
end
of
the
beach
almost
beneath
a
frozen
waterfall
an
emerald
of
huge
size
and
wonderful
form
illustration
pelagic
reverie
rockwell
is
in
high
spirits
i
think
the
augmentation
of
our
diet
brought
by
olson
return
will
do
him
a
lot
of
good
we
had
cut
down
on
our
use
of
milk
to
a
can
in
two
or
three
days
now
we
may
live
on
fish
which
olson
has
in
such
quantities
that
we
to
help
ourselves
olson
has
insisted
on
my
accepting
a
sack
of
flour
for
my
services
during
his
six
weeks
absence
and
i
expect
to
find
it
hard
to
be
allowed
to
return
the
cereals
that
i
am
borrowing
what
a
contrast
this
country
to
the
mean
spirit
of
newfoundland
monday
february
seventeenth
three
days
and
what
has
happened
i
guess
that
on
the
first
of
them
i
stretched
and
painted
canvas
on
the
second
all
day
i
painted
it
was
quite
and
the
sun
shone
through
trees
and
i
have
written
from
early
morning
before
breakfast
until
now
eleven
at
night
i
have
decided
to
go
to
seward
in
a
few
days
it
has
become
necessary
to
go
back
to
new
york
very
soon
i
told
rockwell
of
this
and
his
eyes
have
scarcely
been
dry
since
he
has
reasoned
with
me
and
inquired
into
every
detail
of
the
situation
he
does
to
go
to
new
york
nor
even
to
live
in
the
country
in
the
east
there
be
no
ocean
near
nor
any
warm
pond
for
bathing
and
not
even
the
thought
that
elsewhere
he
have
playmates
weighs
against
his
love
for
this
spot
you
should
see
sir
lancelot
now
his
clothes
are
outgrown
and
outworn
they
hang
in
tatters
about
him
his
trousers
are
burst
from
the
knee
to
the
hip
his
overalls
that
cover
them
are
rags
his
shirt
is
buttonless
but
for
two
in
front
from
above
tattered
elbows
his
sleeves
hang
in
ribbons
his
hair
is
long
and
shaggy
where
it
hung
over
his
eyes
i
have
cut
it
off
short
his
fair
cheeks
are
as
pink
as
roses
his
eyes
are
beautiful
and
blue
his
lips
are
red
and
his
face
glows
always
with
expression
so
we
do
care
a
rap
for
the
rest
only
rockwell
does
one
day
after
he
had
regarded
for
a
long
time
a
certain
unfortunate
photograph
of
himself
in
which
he
looked
like
an
idiot
he
said
father
i
like
to
dress
up
some
day
and
put
on
my
best
clothes
and
brush
my
hair
because
i
want
to
see
if
i
really
look
like
i
do
in
this
picture
rockwell
loves
to
look
well
and
it
a
real
treat
for
him
to
dress
up
so
that
being
the
case
and
his
tidy
nature
being
so
well
assured
i
do
trouble
a
bit
to
adorn
him
he
cleans
his
teeth
regularly
and
likes
to
do
it
mornings
we
get
up
together
and
go
through
a
set
of
sargent
exercises
do
them
with
great
energy
then
we
go
naked
the
period
of
chattering
teeth
is
past
no
matter
what
the
weather
is
we
go
calmly
out
into
it
lie
down
in
the
drift
look
up
into
the
sky
and
then
scrub
ourselves
with
snow
it
the
finest
bath
in
the
world
it
rains
or
snows
the
snow
lies
three
feet
deep
on
the
level
at
our
windows
it
is
above
the
sills
in
seward
have
i
written
this
before
it
lies
so
deep
that
one
ca
see
across
the
street
the
snow
is
the
deepest
and
that
last
cold
snap
the
coldest
of
any
winter
remembered
or
recorded
the
cold
was
very
many
degrees
below
zero
so
we
experienced
a
true
winter
we
so
glad
to
know
it
tuesday
february
eighteenth
such
mild
weather
with
the
fire
nearly
out
it
hot
indoors
a
little
snow
a
little
rain
but
altogether
a
pleasant
day
always
pleasant
when
i
paint
well
i
redeemed
two
straying
pictures
and
they
among
the
elect
now
a
steamer
entered
from
the
westward
the
long
expected
she
must
have
been
here
two
or
three
days
ago
and
since
then
been
to
seldovia
with
incredible
slowness
she
crept
over
the
water
what
old
hulks
they
do
put
onto
this
alaska
service
illustration
prison
bars
rockwell
mothering
of
all
things
exceeded
reason
he
put
two
sticks
of
wood
on
the
fire
after
i
had
intended
it
to
go
out
i
removed
them
blazing
merrily
do
cried
rockwell
seriously
you
hurt
the
fire
feelings
rockwell
cleared
off
the
boat
next
we
must
dig
her
out
the
engine
must
be
put
in
order
we
must
find
a
hole
in
the
gasoline
tank
and
solder
it
and
then
coax
it
into
starting
it
is
on
such
jobs
that
whole
precious
days
are
wasted
rockwell
loves
every
foot
of
this
spot
of
land
he
spoke
of
the
beauties
of
the
lake
its
steep
wooded
shores
clean
and
pebbly
and
the
one
low
clear
and
level
spot
where
we
approached
the
water
he
had
planned
to
live
this
summer
the
day
long
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
naked
playing
in
and
out
of
the
water
or
paddling
some
craft
about
i
thought
of
putting
up
a
tent
in
some
mossy
dell
along
the
shore
and
letting
rockwell
sleep
there
nights
alone
and
learn
early
the
wonders
of
a
hermit
life
and
none
of
it
is
to
be
wednesday
february
nineteenth
it
rains
and
storms
but
we
repaired
the
engine
and
we
ready
to
start
for
seward
when
it
clears
above
every
other
thought
now
is
the
sad
realization
that
our
days
on
this
beloved
island
are
nearing
an
end
what
is
it
that
endears
it
so
to
a
man
near
forty
and
a
little
boy
of
nine
we
have
such
widely
different
outlooks
upon
life
it
may
be
that
alaska
stands
midway
between
us
and
that
i
turning
backward
from
the
crowded
world
that
i
have
known
and
learned
to
fear
meet
rockwell
in
his
march
from
nothing
to
this
if
that
be
so
we
have
met
only
for
a
moment
for
such
perfect
sympathy
his
love
will
pass
on
from
this
and
mine
will
grow
dissatisfied
and
wander
still
but
i
think
it
otherwise
it
seems
that
we
have
both
together
by
chance
turned
out
of
the
beaten
crowded
way
and
come
to
stand
face
to
face
with
that
infinite
and
unfathomable
thing
which
is
the
wilderness
and
here
we
have
found
ourselves
for
the
wilderness
is
nothing
else
it
is
a
kind
of
living
mirror
that
gives
back
as
its
own
all
and
only
all
that
the
imagination
of
a
man
brings
to
it
it
that
which
we
believe
it
to
be
so
here
we
have
stood
we
two
and
if
we
have
not
shuddered
at
the
emptiness
of
the
abyss
and
fled
from
its
loneliness
it
is
because
of
the
wealth
of
our
own
souls
that
filled
the
void
with
imagery
warmed
it
and
gave
it
speech
and
understanding
this
vast
wild
land
we
have
made
a
child
world
and
a
man
i
know
nothing
in
all
life
more
beautiful
than
the
perfect
belief
of
rockwell
in
his
paradise
here
unopposed
his
romance
has
kindled
every
object
on
the
homestead
so
that
now
for
hours
he
can
steal
about
in
the
forest
on
the
beach
along
the
lake
in
absolute
contentment
for
it
is
wonderland
itself
the
king
road
the
giant
path
where
stand
the
gummy
butter
tree
and
all
the
giants
with
whom
sir
lancelot
must
joust
the
magpie
grave
marked
with
a
cross
the
otter
cave
the
marvelous
frozen
stream
those
strange
wild
people
the
treaps
who
visit
these
shores
occasionally
to
hunt
the
white
man
for
his
skin
as
the
white
man
has
hunted
their
dear
animals
and
appalling
animals
that
inhabit
the
dark
woods
but
are
good
friends
to
rockwell
every
log
and
rotten
stump
the
gnarled
trees
with
or
without
butter
every
mound
and
path
the
rocks
the
streams
each
is
a
being
in
itself
and
with
those
most
living
goats
and
the
brilliant
magpies
the
pretty
little
dingy
sparrows
the
glorious
and
virtuous
porcupines
the
black
black
crows
the
great
and
noble
eagle
the
rare
spider
and
the
rarer
fly
and
the
wonderful
strong
sleek
otters
that
leap
in
sport
through
the
snow
and
coast
they
make
a
world
of
romance
that
has
thrilled
one
little
boy
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
soul
to
live
here
to
accumulate
about
him
more
and
more
animals
and
shelter
them
from
harm
to
live
forever
or
if
he
must
grow
old
and
old
here
marry
not
a
seward
girl
but
one
more
beautiful
or
an
indian
here
raise
a
great
family
and
here
die
that
now
is
the
ideal
of
little
rockwell
and
if
we
his
family
all
of
us
would
count
we
must
come
here
to
him
where
with
patriarchal
magnificence
and
dignity
he
will
care
for
us

thursday
february
twentieth
all
day
both
of
us
in
the
morning
rockwell
and
i
journeyed
around
the
point
between
the
two
coves
of
the
island
it
a
rocky
promontory
with
a
great
jumble
of
bowlders
at
its
base
that
one
must
scramble
over
these
are
generally
wet
and
slippery
and
not
much
fun
however
we
went
well
around
and
i
set
up
my
canvas
and
painted
while
rockwell
crawled
about
in
caves
and
crevasses
playing
some
sort
of
wild
beast
the
wind
rose
as
i
finished
and
made
it
difficult
to
convey
my
wet
canvas
without
damaging
it
and
in
the
afternoon
again
i
painted
on
two
pictures
that
to
be
my
work
now
till
the
time
i
go
if
the
day
is
right
we
start
for
seward
our
boat
is
dug
out
of
the
snow
our
goods
are
packed
the
engine
chafes
at
the
throttle
i
am
tired
and
it
is
bedtime
sunday
february
friday
was
calm
we
left
the
island
at
about
eleven
after
the
usual
hours
fussing
with
the
engine
at
hogg
camp
we
called
in
for
something
to
bale
with
for
the
boat
being
leaky
had
taken
in
a
lot
of
water
no
one
at
home
so
i
stole
a
bowl
from
the
shed
and
we
proceeded
by
then
the
sun
shone
upon
us
and
we
could
observe
what
we
later
confirmed
at
seward
that
the
sun
shines
at
the
head
of
the
bay
while
the
island
island
is
shrouded
in
clouds
quite
different
conditions
prevail
in
the
two
localities
with
us
it
is
warmer
and
much
wetter
the
recorded
rainfall
for
seward
that
some
time
ago
seemed
incredibly
small
does
not
fit
fox
island
at
all
records
for
last
summer
show
prevailing
rainy
weather
and
seward
rejoiced
in
unprecedented
sunshine
and
during
these
three
days
in
seward
now
days
wonderfully
fair
thick
clouds
have
always
been
over
fox
island
and
even
the
wind
blows
there
when
seward
waters
are
calm
and
so
on
friday
we
reached
seward
with
flying
colors
stowed
our
boat
up
high
put
the
engine
into
olson
cabin
and
walked
again
the
streets
of
civilization
here
everyone
is
friendly
the
first
night
rockwell
dined
out
at
one
house
and
slept
at
another
with
a
lot
of
children
what
must
they
have
thought
of
his
underclothes
i
went
supperless
writing
letters
instead
and
then
flute
music
at
the
postmaster
next
day
very
early
the
steamer
came
and
the
day
passed
for
me
in
the
wild
excitement
of
receiving
mail
wednesday
february
yesterday
we
came
home
we
left
seward
with
only
a
light
load
aboard
it
blew
briskly
in
the
bay
from
the
north
before
we
reached
head
there
was
a
splendid
chop
racing
along
with
us
midway
across
it
was
about
all
the
engine
could
have
stood
the
propeller
is
not
set
at
enough
depth
in
our
boat
and
in
sea
it
was
most
of
the
time
out
of
water
racing
at
a
furious
pace
then
the
boat
would
naturally
lose
steerage
way
and
we
swing
far
out
of
our
course
but
it
was
great
sport
into
it
we
could
have
made
no
headway
it
nothing
could
stop
us
and
the
engine
kept
right
on
going
only
as
usual
it
was
continually
falling
apart
on
friday
the
flywheel
came
loose
six
times
the
muffler
four
and
the
valve
spring
fell
off
and
stayed
off
coming
back
all
went
well
till
we
were
in
the
roughest
sea
then
the
muffler
came
loose
not
wanting
to
stop
the
engine
in
that
sea
i
spent
half
the
time
on
my
knees
holding
the
tiller
in
one
hand
and
the
muffler
nut
with
a
pair
of
pliers
in
the
other
rockwell
bailed
most
of
the
time
the
boat
leaks
like
a
sieve
illustration
immanence
and
how
fine
to
get
home
again
only
an
hour
and
we
were
again
seated
at
dinner
in
our
warm
cabin
rockwell
said
it
was
hard
for
him
to
remember
whether
olson
or
we
had
just
been
to
seward
i
brought
olson
a
battery
box
and
batteries
as
a
present
he
was
much
pleased
but
particularly
his
mail
pleased
him
i
saw
him
soon
after
our
arrival
seated
with
his
spectacles
on
studying
his
letters
he
rarely
gets
any
this
time
came
a
and
letter
from
mother
the
day
passed
and
evening
came
then
appeared
entering
our
cove
a
cabined
gasoline
boat
two
young
fellows
came
ashore
and
we
all
chatted
in
olson
cabin
one
had
his
wife
aboard
they
claimed
to
be
hunting
a
stray
boat
but
olson
whispered
to
me
later
dramatically
that
they
were
doubtless
out
dragging
somewhere
for
a
cache
of
whiskey
lots
of
whiskey
has
been
sunk
in
the
bay
marks
were
taken
at
the
time
to
determine
its
location
and
now
the
owners
as
need
arises
fish
up
what
they
want
it
just
like
the
buried
treasure
of
the
days
of
piracy
doubtless
there
are
now
many
charts
extant
with
the
position
of
liquid
treasure
marked
upon
them
has
been
again
overcast
but
beautifully
mild
it
is
really
a
wonderful
climate
rockwell
makes
the
most
of
these
last
days
he
went
this
morning
to
the
ridge
top
east
of
us
and
this
afternoon
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
he
now
wants
to
stay
here
and
become
a
wild
man
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
about
his
entire
willingness
his
desire
to
be
left
here
when
i
go
chapter
xi
twilight
the
first
of
march
if
only
the
dull
weather
would
clear
up
i
could
get
more
done
these
last
days
here
fifteen
canvases
hang
from
my
ridge
pole
waiting
for
pictures
to
adorn
them
is
the
only
day
that
work
has
been
quite
out
of
the
question
it
snows
hard
last
thursday
morning
rockwell
and
i
began
to
take
our
morning
baths
in
the
bay
the
snow
having
become
too
hard
and
now
at
just
on
cloudy
mornings
clothed
in
sneakers
we
scamper
down
the
shore
and
plunge
into
the
waves
brrrrrrrr
it
cold
but
mighty
good
olson
after
predicting
for
some
time
a
dire
end
to
our
morning
performances
has
at
last
evinced
enough
curiosity
to
drag
himself
out
of
bed
and
come
over
to
see
but
he
has
not
yet
been
early
enough
to
catch
us
the
days
are
lengthening
rapidly
it
is
now
after
six
in
the
evening
and
our
lamp
not
lighted
last
time
in
seward
olson
bought
a
lot
of
odds
and
ends
of
molding
for
picture
frames
and
now
with
my
help
all
the
little
things
that
we
have
given
him
are
gorgeously
framed
on
the
little
picture
of
himself
that
i
painted
he
has
what
he
calls
a
comoflag
frame
it
made
of
moldings
on
the
four
sides
well
olson
is
mighty
proud
of
his
pictures
he
really
very
fond
of
us
people
in
seward
say
he
talks
of
us
continually
and
there
it
is
thought
quite
remarkable
how
i
have
managed
with
the
crazy
old
man
i
guess
the
craziness
explains
it
i
picture
with
horror
having
as
a
constant
companion
here
one
of
the
fine
stalwart
shrewd
honest
americans
that
our
country
likes
to
be
so
proud
of
i
told
olson
of
kathleen
amusement
over
the
brusque
ending
of
his
letter
answer
this
if
you
feel
like
it
and
if
you
do
it
all
the
same
to
me
well
he
said
that
the
way
it
is
here
in
alaska
if
anyone
like
the
way
a
man
does
he
can
go
to
hell
i
heard
an
amusing
story
about
olson
and
his
goats
at
a
little
seward
exposition
at
which
they
were
shown
they
put
his
two
goats
into
narrow
packing
boxes
that
their
dirt
might
not
fall
onto
the
floor
of
the
building
olson
arrived
and
seeing
the
plight
of
his
pets
flew
into
a
rage
he
lifted
them
out
hurled
the
packing
boxes
out
of
the
door
into
the
street
and
denounced
the
for
their
abuse
of
animals
and
although
the
whole
place
tumbled
about
the
old
man
ears
he
won
and
saw
his
goats
given
an
honorable
amount
of
freedom
in
a
special
enclosure
curtained
off
admission
to
see
the
goats
ten
cents
which
notice
olson
promptly
disregarded
letting
everyone
in
and
a
big
crowd
at
that
free
monday
march
third
inauguration
day
passed
here
without
event
in
this
ideal
community
of
fox
island
we
so
little
concerned
with
only
law
that
bears
on
us
at
all
we
delight
in
breaking
that
one
wonders
how
far
can
be
carried
one
goes
back
to
first
principles
in
such
speculation
endows
man
again
with
inalienable
rights
or
at
least
inalienable
desires
and
then
has
simply
to
wonder
how
much
of
the
love
of
order
there
is
in
the
natural
man
the
fact
that
a
large
proportion
of
mankind
can
live
and
die
without
any
definite
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
the
community
and
without
ever
running
counter
to
the
forces
of
law
is
sign
enough
that
most
of
the
law
code
is
but
a
writing
down
of
what
the
average
man
naturally
wants
to
do
or
keep
from
doing
there
a
sharp
difference
between
such
common
law
and
the
exceptional
law
that
strikes
at
the
personal
liberty
of
a
man
laws
concerning
morals
temperance
or
that
conscript
unwilling
men
for
war
in
all
law
there
is
tyranny
in
these
laws
tyranny
shows
its
hand
the
man
who
wants
true
freedom
must
escape
from
the
whole
thing
if
only
such
souls
could
gravitate
to
a
common
center
and
build
the
new
community
with

and
order
as
its
sole
guide
well
we
have
returned
to
the
problem
a
state
that
was
truly
interested
in
progress
would
dedicate
a
portion
of
its
territory
to
such
an
experiment
but
no
state
is
interested
in
anything
but
the
gain
of
one
class
which
means
the
oppression
of
the
rest
how
farcical
sound
these
days
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
no
government
without
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
other
principles
but
they
have
still
to
be
reckoned
with
till
the
last
bolshevik
has
been
converted
into
a
prosperous
tradesman
and
the
last
idealist
is
dead
and
now
for
fox
island
the
weather
is
dull
and
gray
only
last
evening
an
hour
before
sundown
the
clouds
suddenly
vanished
out
of
the
heavens
and
the
sun
shone
as
warm
and
beautiful
as
on
the
fairest
summer
day
then
i
sat
and
painted
while
the
snow
and
ice
melted
and
dripped
all
about
the
mornings
are
cold
doubly
cold
it
seems
when
in
the
of
dawn
and
perhaps
a
driving
snow
squall
we
run
naked
down
the
long
stretch
of
beach
and
plunge
into
the
bay
i
work
ceaselessly
time
flies
like
mad
and
the
day
of
our
departure
is
close
illustration
the
vision
tuesday
march
fourth
a
day
of
snow
and
rain
spent
by
us
indoors
rockwell
hard
at
work
upon
his
chart
of
trobbeabl
island
a
wonderful
imaginary
land
where
his
own
strange
species
of
wild
animals
live
and
i
washing
and
mending
my
seaman
bag
damaged
on
its
way
here
in
the
hold
of
the
steamer
is
now
quite
professionally
patched
and
the
knee
of
my
blue
overalls
shines
with
a
square
patch
of
white
canvas
olson
was
welcome
and
spent
much
of
the
day
with
us
he
has
reread
kathleen
letter
to
him
and
is
charmed
with
it
he
feels
authorized
by
it
to
keep
me
here
longer
and
surely
does
his
best
to
persuade
me
he
treasures
the
picture
little
kathleen
sent
him
all
these
things
the
letters
and
little
trifles
that
we
have
given
him
will
be
stored
away
in
his
too
empty
box
of
treasures
among
a
very
few
old
letters
and
a
photograph
or
two
of
pioneer
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
costumes
of
thirty
years
ago
these
scant
treasures
what
a
memorial
of
a
very
lonely
life
he
showed
me
a
photograph
of
tom
crane
an
old
associate
of
his
in
idaho
and
two
large
splendid
looking
women
crane
wife
and
his
wife
sister
the
wife
was
frozen
to
death
in
the
snow
while
on
a
short
journey
with
her
husband
he
lost
both
feet
olson
led
the
rescue
party
bringing
in
with
great
difficulty
the
dead
woman
and
then
tending
crane
through
long
painful
days
until
his
crippled
recovery
thursday
march
sixth
it
mighty
hard
work
this
painting
under
pressure
i
too
tired
to
attempt
more
than
the
briefest
record
on
this
page
of
two
doings
yesterday
it
was
gray
at
sundown
it
cleared
giving
us
the
most
splendid
and
beautiful
sunset
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
purple
snowy
mountains
and
throwing
its
rays
upward
into
a
seething
mass
of
clouds
i
painted
most
of
the
afternoon
we
bathed
at
sunrise
brisk
and
cold
and
clear
the
morning
tide
was
so
exceedingly
low
that
i
ran
dry
shod
clear
around
the
north
side
of
the
cove
until
the
whole
upper
bay
was
visible
olson
had
not
known
it
could
be
done
returning
we
put
olson
boat
into
the
water
and
rockwell
and
i
embarked
with
my
painting
outfit
i
landed
on
the
point
i
had
just
visited
afoot
rockwell
in
jumping
ashore
with
the
painter
timed
it
badly
slipped
and
fell
full
length
into
the
surf
of
the
ground
swell
the
dory
almost
riding
over
him
i
roared
with
laughter
to
his
great
fury
he
rowed
about
in
the
harbor
for
almost
two
hours
returning
to
bring
me
home
in
the
afternoon
we
repeated
our
excursion
all
but
the
water
sports
going
this
time
to
the
south
side
of
the
cove
rockwell
a
good
little
oarsman
and
above
all
to
be
trusted
to
do
as
he
told
to
a
vice
in
a
virtue
in
children
friday
march
seventh
that
began
in
snow
and
cloud
matters
not
it
ended
in
a
glory
olson
rockwell
and
i
sat
that
late
afternoon
far
out
on
the
bay
basking
in
the
warmth
of
a
summer
sun
rocked
gently
on
a
blue
summer
sea
for
hours
we
had
explored
the
island
western
shore
skirting
its
tumbled
reefs
riding
through
perilous
straits
right
up
to
where
the
eddying
water
seethed
at
some
jagged
chasm
mouth
that
fine
adventuring
flirting
with
danger
safe
enough
but
close
so
close
to
death
we
landed
on
the
beach
of
sunny
cove
found
in
the
dark
thicket
the
moldering
ruins
of
an
old
feed
house
of
the
foxes
gruesome
with
the
staring
bones
of
devoured
carcasses
and
then
we
younger
ones
dashed
up
the
sheer
eastward
ridge
dashed
on
all
fours
digging
our
feet
into
the
snow
clinging
with
hands
as
to
a
ladder
there
at
the
top
two
or
three
hundred
feet
above
the
bay
we
overlooked
the
farthest
seaward
mountains
of
cape
resurrection
then
barwell
island
and
the
open
sea
ah
to
see
again
that
far
horizon
wander
where
you
will
over
all
the
world
from
every
valley
seeing
forever
new
hills
calling
you
to
climb
them
from
every
mountain
top
farther
peaks
enticing
you
always
the
land
looks
fairest
till
you
are
made
at
last
a
restless
wanderer
never
reaching
home
until
you
stand
one
day
on
the
last
peak
on
the
border
of
the
interminable
sea
stopped
by
the
finality
of
that
illustration
the
imperishable
from
our
feet
the
cliff
dropped
in
a
divide
straight
down
to
the
green
ocean
and
at
its
base
the
ground
swell
curled
broke
white
and
eddied
the
jagged
mountains
across
shone
white
against
black
clouds
what
peaks
huge
and
sharp
like
the
teeth
of
the
we
hurried
back
to
olson
who
waited
in
the
boat
that
side
the
cove
and
the
more
familiar
mountains
to
the
westward
lay
half
shrouded
in
fast
dissolving
mist
the
descent
was
real
sport
we
just
sat
down
and
slid
clear
to
the
bottom
going
at
toboggan
pace
poor
olson
who
watched
us
from
below
was
aghast
on
the
shore
i
found
a
long
thick
bamboo
pole
doubtless
carried
directly
here
from
the
orient
by
the
japanese
current
we
longed
to
go
across
to
bear
glacier
that
we
could
now
see
a
broad
inclined
plane
spotless
white
with
the
tallest
mountains
rising
steeply
from
its
borders
but
it
was
too
late
and
we
returned
home
the
wonders
of
this
country
of
this
one
bay
in
fact
it
would
take
years
to
know
monday
march
tenth
on
the
eighth
it
snowed
hard
all
day
and
both
of
us
worked
at
our
trade
indoors
the
ninth
dawned
fresh
and
clear
and
cold
it
was
too
windy
to
go
out
onto
the
bay
as
we
had
intended
so
not
to
be
entirely
cheated
out
of
an
excursion
we
packed
a
bag
of
various
supplies
and
set
off
for
the
ridge
to
the
eastward
it
was
glorious
in
the
woods
new
fallen
snow
lay
upon
the
tree
branches
the
sun
touched
only
the
tallest
tops
the
wind
rustled
them
now
and
then
and
made
it
snow
again
below
we
came
out
upon
the
summit
of
the
ridge
more
to
the
north
than
we
had
ever
been
before
and
from
there
beheld
again
the
open
sea
nothing
can
be
more
wonderful
than
to
emerge
from
the
dense
forest
onto
such
a
view
right
on
the
ridge
we
built
a
fire
beneath
the
arched
roots
of
a
large
tree
rockwell
will
long
remember
that
wonderful
chimney
beneath
the
roots
i
painted
on
one
of
the
canvases
i
had
brought
while
rockwell
played
about
or
cut
wood
for
the
fire
presently
the
can
of
beans
that
laid
in
the
ashes
went
pop
and
we
knew
that
dinner
was
ready
so
we
sat
down
and
ate
the
good
beans
bread
and
peanut
butter
and
chocolate
while
our
backs
sizzled
and
our
bellies
froze
but
we
loved
it
and
rockwell
proposed
that
we
spend
three
or
four
days
there
like
that
then
after
more
painting
and
some
play
in
the
snow
we
came
home
again
but
the
beautiful
days
must
be
busy
ones
for
me
i
painted
out
on
the
lake
for
an
hour
or
more
after
that
time
the
glorious
sunset
after
supper
bread
to
bake
and
then
tired
out
early
to
sleep
in
our
great
hard
comfortable
bed
olson
would
have
started
had
the
weather
been
moderate
but
it
has
blown
fiercely
from
the
north
and
still
it
blows
all
day
i
worked
packing
and
now
my
boxes
are
made
and
nearly
filled
it
is
surely
true
that
we
are
going
all
day
it
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
fall
we
had
thought
of
that
before
during
these
recent
days
we
scent
it
and
feel
it
i
believe
that
the
end
of
a
real
summer
in
our
lives
that
we
taste
the
sadness
of
tuesday
march
eleventh
it
blows
incessantly
cold
and
clear
blue
days
i
have
painted
most
of
first
indoors
and
then
outdoors
commencing
a
large
picture
olson
has
been
with
us
much
of
the
time
he
treasures
every
little
memento
we
can
give
him
in
his
are
snapshots
of
kathleen
clara
and
barbara
he
wanted
barbara
curl
that
i
have
but
i
could
give
him
that
it
looks
as
if
we
should
all
go
to
seward
together
this
wind
is
likely
to
hold
until
the
full
moon
passes
and
that
still
some
days
off
my
trunk
is
about
packed
and
what
remains
can
be
done
in
a
very
few
hours
illustration
the
speaking
to
olson
about
the
possibility
of
a
shipwrecked
man
being
able
to
support
life
on
this
coast
for
any
length
of
time
he
told
of
a
native
boy
of
unga
crazy
simyon
who
lived
four
years
at
nigger
head
a
wild
part
of
unga
island
with
no
shelter
but
a
hole
in
a
sand
bank
no
fire
no
weapons
or
clothes
or
tools
a
story
long
wild
terrible
beginning
with
a
boy
theft
of
sacrificial
wine
and
ending
in
madness
and
murder
thursday
march
thirteenth
last
night
was
bitterly
cold
i
had
to
get
up
repeatedly
to
attend
to
the
fire
the
wind
howled
and
the
vapor
flew
and
rockwell
and
i
hugged
close
together
beneath
the
blankets
day
dawned
still
icy
cold
by
noon
it
began
to
snow
and
the
afternoon
was
calm
and
mild
and
now
again
the
wind
blows
fiercely
from
the
northeast
and
we
freezing
cold
the
day
was
spent
in
packing
the
dismantled
cabin
looks
forlorn
sunday
march
sixteenth
with
the
full
moon
has
come
the
most
perfect
calm
if
it
holds
through
we
shall
leave
the
island
the
past
three
days
have
been
busy
ones
bitterly
cold
weather
has
prevailed
with
the
wind
unceasingly
from
the
north
almost
the
coldest
days
of
the
winter
still
i
did
some
painting
every
day
until
yesterday
trying
hard
to
pin
upon
the
canvas
a
little
more
of
the
infinite
splendors
of
this
place
meanwhile
our
packing
was
carried
on
we
have
made
a
thoroughly
good
job
of
it
i
hope
but
who
can
tell
what
strain
a
trip
of
so
many
thousand
miles
will
put
upon
our
crates
and
bundles
but
for
a
promise
we
had
made
olson
to
go
with
him
to
sunny
bay
and
humpback
creek
on
the
eastern
mainland
we
have
gone
this
day
to
seward
by
noon
the
most
perfect
calm
had
settled
upon
the
water
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
although
really
it
was
still
very
cold
the
bright
sun
like
warmth
and
that
helped
a
lot
so
olson
little
engine
sputtering
stammering
stopping
a
great
deal
carried
us
upon
our
trip
at
humpback
creek
there
are
falls
maybe
thirty
feet
high
perfect
falls
tumbling
sheer
down
from
a
plateau
into
a
deep
round
basin
the
falls
were
frozen
and
spread
wide
over
the
face
of
the
cliff
but
it
was
easy
to
imagine
the
grace
of
their
summer
form
we
had
to
hurry
from
here
or
be
stranded
by
the
rapidly
retreating
tide
next
we
went
to
a
spot
on
the
bay
where
rockwell
and
i
might
have
lived
had
we
not
met
olson
that
fair
sunday
in
august
a
little
cabin
stood
there
open
to
the
weather
through
doorway
and
window
but
otherwise
snug
and
comfortable
still
even
with
that
wonder
the
fall
so
near
that
spot
was
not
to
be
compared
with
our
own
fox
island
home
next
we
went
to
sunny
bay
to
visit
the
old
trapper
who
has
been
wintering
there
the
same
who
stopped
last
fall
at
our
island
while
on
his
way
to
camp
the
old
fellow
came
to
meet
us
as
we
landed
a
feeble
emaciated
figure
he
has
been
sick
all
winter
and
has
done
practically
no
trapping
what
a
forlorn
latter
end
for
a
man
he
drags
himself
about
each
day
cuts
wood
lugs
water
cooks
and
when
he
stoops
dizziness
overcomes
him
he
sets
a
small
circle
of
traps
and
drags
himself
around
to
tend
them
his
whole
winter
work
is
twelve
ermine
and
two
or
forty
dollars
worth
at
the
most
we
offered
to
bring
the
old
man
back
with
us
and
from
here
on
to
seward
but
he
preferred
to
stay
there
a
few
days
longer
and
now
i
sit
here
with
our
packed
household
goods
about
me
empty
walls
and
a
dismantled
home
still
we
hardly
realize
that
this
beautiful
adventure
of
ours
has
come
to
an
end
the
enchantment
of
it
has
been
complete
it
has
possessed
us
to
the
very
last
how
long
such
happiness
could
hold
such
quiet
life
continue
to
fill
up
the
full
measure
of
human
desires
only
a
long
experience
could
teach
the
still
deep
cup
of
the
wilderness
is
potent
with
wisdom
only
to
have
tasted
it
is
to
have
moved
a
lifetime
forward
to
a
finer
youth
tuesday
march
eighteenth
fox
island
is
behind
us
last
august
olson
picked
us
up
as
strangers
and
towed
us
to
his
island
yesterday
after
nearly
seven
months
there
with
him
we
climbed
again
into
our
dories
and
crossed
the
bay
and
now
we
extend
the
helping
hand
to
the
old
man
and
tow
him
and
his
faltering
engine
back
to
seward
the
day
dawned
cold
and
windy
we
proceeded
however
at
once
to
the
completion
of
our
packing
and
the
loading
of
the
boat
a
little
after
noon
the
wind
moderating
slightly
we
persuaded
olson
to
come
with
us
my
engine
working
beautifully
carried
both
boats
along
till
the
other
little
motor
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
start
in
the
bay
the
wind
was
fresh
and
the
chop
high
across
the
wind
had
risen
and
the
water
flew
olson
engine
worked
so
poorly
that
most
of
the
time
i
had
the
full
strain
of
his
dory
on
the
line
i
feared
the
old
man
courage
would
give
out
as
the
sea
increased
and
i
grinned
at
him
reassuringly
from
time
to
time
finally
however
as
the
waves
seemed
to
rush
ever
more
fiercely
upon
us
his
face
grew
solemn
he
waved
to
us
to
turn
and
run
back
to
the
island
but
the
tow
line
was
fast
in
my
boat
and
i
neither
chose
to
turn
nor
loosen
it
showing
our
backs
to
him
we
ran
for
the
shelter
of
head
and
made
it
from
there
onward
we
skirted
the
cliffs
and
found
it
smooth
enough
the
wind
again
died
out
and
we
entered
seward
over
a
glassy
sea
and
now
at
last
it
over
fox
island
will
soon
become
in
our
memories
like
a
dream
or
vision
a
remote
experience
too
wonderful
for
the
full
liberty
we
knew
there
and
the
deep
peace
to
be
remembered
or
believed
in
as
a
experience
in
life
it
was
for
us
life
as
it
should
be
serene
and
wholesome
love
but
no
hate
faith
without
disillusionment
the
absolute
for
the
toiling
hands
of
man
and
for
his
soaring
spirit
olson
of
the
deep
experience
strong
brave
generous
and
gentle
like
a
child
and
his
island
like
paradise
ah
god
and
now
the
world
again
