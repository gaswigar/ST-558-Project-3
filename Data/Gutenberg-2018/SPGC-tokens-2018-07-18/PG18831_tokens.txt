allan
hartley
in
the
back
of
the
neck
soft
billows
of
oblivion
closed
in
upon
him
and
all
that
remained
to
him
was
a
tiny
spark
of
awareness
glowing
alone
and
lost
in
a
great
darkness
the
spark
grew
brighter
he
was
more
than
a
something
that
merely
knew
that
it
existed
he
was
a
man
and
he
had
a
name
and
a
military
rank
and
memories
memories
of
the
searing
flash
and
of
what
he
had
been
doing
outside
the
shelter
the
moment
before
and
memories
of
the
siege
and
of
the
retreat
from
the
north
and
memories
of
the
days
before
the
war
back
to
the
time
when
he
had
been
little
allan
hartley
a
schoolboy
the
son
of
a
successful
lawyer
in
williamsport
pennsylvania
his
mother
he
could
not
remember
there
was
only
a
vague
impression
of
the
house
full
of
people
who
had
tried
to
comfort
him
for
something
he
could
not
understand
but
he
remembered
the
old
german
woman
who
had
kept
house
for
his
father
afterward
and
he
remembered
his
bedroom
with
its
chairs
and
the
patch
quilt
on
the
old
cherry
bed
and
the
tan
curtains
at
the
windows
edged
with
dusky
red
and
the
morning
sun
shining
through
them
he
could
almost
see
them
now
he
blinked
he
see
them
for
a
long
time
he
lay
staring
at
them
unbelievingly
and
then
he
deliberately
closed
his
eyes
and
counted
ten
seconds
and
as
he
counted
terror
gripped
him
he
was
afraid
to
open
them
again
lest
he
find
himself
blind
or
gazing
at
the
filth
and
wreckage
of
a
blasted
city
but
when
he
reached
ten
he
forced
himself
to
look
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
the
sunlit
curtains
and
the
mist
outside
were
still
there
he
reached
out
to
check
one
sense
against
another
feeling
the
rough
monk
cloth
and
the
edging
of
maroon
silk
thread
they
were
tangible
as
well
as
visible
then
he
saw
that
the
back
of
his
hand
was
unscarred
there
should
have
been
a
scar
souvenir
of
a
brawl
of
his
cub
reporter
days
he
examined
both
hands
closely
an
instant
later
he
had
sat
up
in
bed
and
thrown
off
the
covers
partially
removing
his
pajamas
and
inspecting
as
much
of
his
body
as
was
visible
it
was
the
smooth
body
of
a
little
boy
that
was
ridiculous
he
was
a
man
of
an
army
officer
a
chemist
once
a
novelist
he
had
been
married
and
divorced
ten
years
ago
he
looked
again
at
his
body
it
was
only
twelve
years
old
fourteen
at
the
very
oldest
his
eyes
swept
the
room
wide
with
wonder
every
detail
was
familiar
the
chair
covers
the
table
that
served
as
desk
and
for
his
possessions
the
dresser
with
its
mirror
stuck
full
of
pictures
of
aircraft
it
was
the
bedroom
of
his
childhood
home
he
swung
his
legs
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
they
were
six
inches
too
short
to
reach
the
floor
for
an
instant
the
room
spun
dizzily
and
he
was
in
the
grip
of
utter
panic
all
confidence
in
the
evidence
of
his
senses
lost
was
he
insane
or
delirious
or
had
the
bomb
really
killed
him
was
this
what
death
was
like
what
was
that
thing
about
ye
become
as
little
children
he
started
to
laugh
and
his
juvenile
larynx
made
giggling
sounds
they
seemed
funny
too
and
aggravated
his
mirth
for
a
little
while
he
was
on
the
edge
of
hysteria
and
then
when
he
managed
to
control
his
laughter
he
felt
calmer
if
he
were
dead
then
he
must
be
a
discarnate
entity
and
would
be
able
to
penetrate
matter
to
his
relief
he
was
unable
to
push
his
hand
through
the
bed
so
he
was
alive
he
was
also
fully
awake
and
he
hoped
rational
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
prowled
about
the
room
taking
stock
of
its
contents
there
was
no
calendar
in
sight
and
he
could
find
no
newspapers
or
dated
periodicals
but
he
knew
that
it
was
prior
to
july
on
that
day
his
fourteenth
birthday
his
father
had
given
him
a
light
rifle
and
it
had
been
hung
on
a
pair
of
rustic
forks
on
the
wall
it
was
not
there
now
nor
ever
had
been
on
the
table
he
saw
a
boys
book
of
military
aircraft
with
a
clean
new
dustjacket
the
flyleaf
was
inscribed
allan
hartley
from
his
father
on
his
thirteenth
birthday
glancing
out
the
window
at
the
foliage
on
the
trees
he
estimated
the
date
at
late
july
or
early
august
that
would
make
him
just
thirteen
his
clothes
were
draped
on
a
chair
beside
the
bed
stripping
off
his
pajamas
he
donned
shorts
then
sat
down
and
picked
up
a
pair
of
socks
which
he
regarded
with
disfavor
as
he
pulled
one
on
a
church
bell
began
to
clang
boniface
up
on
the
hill
ringing
for
early
mass
so
this
was
sunday
he
paused
the
second
sock
in
his
hand
there
was
no
question
that
his
present
environment
was
actual
yet
on
the
other
hand
he
possessed
a
set
of
memories
completely
at
variance
with
it
now
suppose
since
his
environment
were
not
an
illusion
everything
else
were
suppose
all
these
troublesome
memories
were
no
more
than
a
dream
why
he
was
just
little
allan
hartley
safe
in
his
room
on
a
sunday
morning
badly
scared
by
a
nightmare
too
much
science
fiction
allan
too
many
comic
books
that
was
a
wonderfully
comforting
thought
and
he
hugged
it
to
him
contentedly
it
lasted
all
the
while
he
was
buttoning
up
his
shirt
and
pulling
on
his
pants
but
when
he
reached
for
his
shoes
it
evaporated
ever
since
he
had
wakened
he
realized
he
had
been
occupied
with
thoughts
utterly
incomprehensible
to
any
even
thinking
in
words
that
would
have
been
so
much
sanscrit
to
himself
at
thirteen
he
shook
his
head
regretfully
the
hypothesis
went
by
the
deep
six
he
picked
up
the
second
shoe
and
glared
at
it
as
though
it
were
responsible
for
his
predicament
he
was
going
to
have
to
be
careful
an
unexpected
display
of
adult
characteristics
might
give
rise
to
some
questions
he
would
find
hard
to
answer
credibly
fortunately
he
was
an
only
child
there
would
be
no
brothers
or
sisters
to
trip
him
up
old
stauber
the
housekeeper
would
be
much
of
a
problem
even
in
his
normal
childhood
he
had
bulked
like
an
intellectual
giant
in
comparison
to
her
but
his
father
now
there
the
going
would
be
tough
he
knew
that
shrewd
mind
whetted
keen
on
a
generation
of
lying
and
reluctant
witnesses
sooner
or
later
he
would
forget
for
an
instant
and
betray
himself
then
he
smiled
remembering
the
books
he
had
discovered
in
his
late
on
his
father
shelves
and
recalling
the
character
of
the
openminded
agnostic
lawyer
if
he
could
only
avoid
the
inevitable
unmasking
until
he
had
a
plausible
explanatory
theory
blake
hartley
was
leaving
the
bathroom
as
allan
hartley
opened
his
door
and
stepped
into
the
hall
the
lawyer
was
and
in
slippers
at
there
was
only
a
faint
powdering
of
gray
in
his
dark
hair
and
not
a
gray
thread
in
his
clipped
mustache
the
old
merry
widower
himself
allan
thought
grinning
as
he
remembered
the
but
still
vigorous
man
from
whom
he
parted
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
dad
he
greeted
son
you
up
early
going
to
sunday
school
now
there
was
the
advantage
of
a
father
who
cut
his
first
intellectual
tooth
on
tom
paine
and
bob
ingersoll
attendance
at
divine
services
was
on
a
strictly
voluntary
basis
why
i
do
think
so
i
want
to
do
some
reading
this
morning
that
always
a
good
thing
to
do
blake
hartley
approved
after
breakfast
suppose
you
take
a
walk
down
to
the
station
and
get
me
a
he
dug
in
his
trouser
pocket
and
came
out
with
a
half
dollar
get
anything
you
want
for
yourself
while
you
at
it
allan
thanked
his
father
and
pocketed
the
coin
stauber
still
be
at
mass
he
suggested
say
i
get
the
paper
now
breakfast
wo
be
ready
till
she
gets
here
good
idea
blake
hartley
nodded
pleased
you
have
of
an
hour
at
least
so
far
he
congratulated
himself
everything
had
gone
smoothly
finishing
his
toilet
he
went
downstairs
and
onto
the
street
turning
left
at
brandon
to
campbell
and
left
again
in
the
direction
of
the
station
before
he
reached
the
underpass
a
dozen
memories
had
revived
here
was
a
house
that
would
in
a
few
years
be
gutted
by
fire
here
were
four
dwellings
standing
where
he
had
last
seen
a
apartment
building
a
gasoline
station
and
a
lot
would
shortly
be
replaced
by
a
supermarket
the
environs
of
the
station
itself
were
a
complete
puzzle
to
him
until
he
oriented
himself
he
bought
a
new
york
glancing
first
of
all
at
the
date
line
sunday
august
he
estimated
pretty
closely
the
battle
of
okinawa
had
been
won
the
potsdam
conference
had
just
ended
there
were
still
pictures
of
the
crash
against
the
empire
state
building
a
week
ago
saturday
and
japan
was
still
being
pounded
by
bombs
from
the
air
and
shells
from
naval
guns
why
tomorrow
hiroshima
was
due
for
the
big
job
it
amused
him
to
reflect
that
he
was
probably
the
only
person
in
williamsport
who
knew
that
on
the
way
home
a
boy
sitting
on
the
top
step
of
a
front
porch
hailed
him
allan
replied
cordially
trying
to
remember
who
it
was
of
course
larry
morton
he
and
allan
had
been
buddies
they
probably
had
been
swimming
or
playing
commandos
and
germans
the
afternoon
before
larry
had
gone
to
cornell
the
same
year
that
allan
had
gone
to
penn
state
they
had
both
graduated
in
larry
had
gotten
into
some
government
bureau
and
then
he
had
married
a
pittsburgh
girl
and
had
become
twelfth
of
her
father
firm
he
had
been
killed
in
in
a
plane
crash
you
gon
na
sunday
school
larry
asked
mercifully
unaware
of
the
fate
allan
foresaw
for
him
why
no
i
have
some
things
i
want
to
do
at
home
he
have
to
watch
himself
larry
would
spot
a
difference
quicker
than
any
adult
heck
with
it
he
added
golly
i
wisht
i
stay
home
from
sunday
school
whenever
i
wanted
to
larry
envied
how
about
us
goin
swimmin
at
the
canoe
club
allan
thought
fast
gee
i
wisht
i
he
replied
lowering
his
grammatical
sights
i
got
ta
stay
home
we
coupla
aunts
of
mine
dad
wants
me
to
stay
home
when
they
come
that
went
over
all
right
anybody
knew
that
there
was
no
rational
accounting
for
the
vagaries
of
the
adult
mind
and
no
appeal
from
adult
demands
the
prospect
of
company
at
the
hartley
home
would
keep
larry
away
that
afternoon
he
showed
his
disappointment
aw
jeepers
creepers
he
blasphemed
euphemistically
mebbe
allan
said
if
i
make
it
i
got
ta
go
now
had
breakfast
yet
he
scuffed
his
feet
boyishly
exchanged
with
his
friend
and
continued
homeward
as
he
had
hoped
the
sunday
paper
kept
his
father
occupied
at
breakfast
to
the
exclusion
of
any
dangerous
table
talk
blake
hartley
was
still
deep
in
the
financial
section
when
allan
left
the
table
and
went
to
the
library
there
should
be
two
books
there
to
which
he
wanted
badly
to
refer
for
a
while
he
was
afraid
that
his
father
had
not
acquired
them
prior
to
but
he
finally
found
them
and
carried
them
onto
the
front
porch
along
with
a
pencil
and
a
ruled
yellow
scratch
pad
in
his
experienced
future
or
his
allan
hartley
had
been
accustomed
to
doing
his
thinking
with
a
pencil
as
reporter
as
novelist
plotting
his
work
as
amateur
chemist
in
his
home
laboratory
as
scientific
warfare
research
officer
his
ideas
had
always
been
clarified
by
making
notes
he
pushed
a
chair
to
the
table
and
built
up
the
seat
with
cushions
wondering
how
soon
he
would
become
used
to
the
proportional
disparity
between
himself
and
the
furniture
as
he
opened
the
books
and
took
his
pencil
in
his
hand
there
was
one
thing
missing
if
he
could
only
smoke
a
pipe
now
his
father
came
out
and
stretched
in
a
wicker
chair
with
the
section
the
morning
hours
passed
allan
hartley
leafed
through
one
book
and
then
the
other
his
pencil
moved
rapidly
at
times
at
others
he
doodled
absently
there
was
no
question
any
more
in
his
mind
as
to
what
or
who
he
was
he
was
allan
hartley
a
man
of
marooned
in
his
own
body
thirty
years
back
in
his
own
past
that
was
of
course
against
all
common
sense
but
he
was
easily
able
to
ignore
that
objection
it
had
been
made
before
against
the
astronomy
of
copernicus
and
the
geography
of
columbus
and
the
biology
of
darwin
and
the
industrial
technology
of
samuel
colt
and
the
military
doctrines
of
charles
de
gaulle
today
common
sense
had
a
habit
of
turning
into
tomorrow
utter
nonsense
what
he
needed
right
now
but
bad
was
a
theory
that
would
explain
what
had
happened
to
him
understanding
was
beginning
to
dawn
when
stauber
came
out
to
announce
midday
dinner
i
hope
you
vo
mind
haffin

so
early

dad
allan

up
why

get
our
own
supper
and
have
a
picnic
like
that
be
fun
and
stauber
could
stay
as
long
as
she
wanted
to
his
father
looked
at
him
such
consideration
for
others
was
a
most
gratifying
deviation
from
the
juvenile
norm
dawn
of
altruism
or
something
he
gave
hearty
assent
why
of
course
stauber
allan
and
i
can
shift
for
ourselves
this
evening
ca
we
allan
you
need
come
back
till
tomorrow
morning
you
you
so
mooch
mr
hartley
at
dinner
allan
got
out
from
under
the
burden
of
conversation
by
questioning
his
father
about
the
war
and
luring
him
into
a
lengthy
dissertation
on
the
difficulties
of
the
forthcoming
invasion
of
japan
in
view
of
what
he
remembered
of
the
next
hours
allan
was
secretly
amused
his
father
was
sure
that
the
war
would
run
on
to
after
dinner
they
returned
to
the
porch
hartley
smoking
a
cigar
and
carrying
out
several
law
books
he
only
glanced
at
these
occasionally
for
the
most
part
he
sat
and
blew
smoke
rings
and
watched
them
float
away
some
felon
was
about
to
be
triumphantly
acquitted
by
a
weeping
jury
allan
could
recognize
a
courtroom
masterpiece
in
the
process
of
incubation
it
was
several
hours
later
that
the
crunch
of
feet
on
the
walk
caused
father
and
son
to
look
up
simultaneously
the
approaching
visitor
was
a
tall
man
in
a
rumpled
black
suit
he
had
knobby
wrists
and
big
awkward
hands
black
hair
flecked
with
gray
and
a
harsh
bigoted
face
allan
remembered
him
frank
gutchall
lived
on
campbell
street
a
religious
fanatic
and
some
sort
of
lay
preacher
maybe
he
needed
legal
advice
allan
could
vaguely
remember
some
incident
ah
good
afternoon
gutchall
lovely
day
is
it
blake
hartley
said
gutchall
cleared
his
throat
hartley
i
wonder
if
you
could
lend
me
a
gun
and
some
bullets
he
began
embarrassedly
my
little
dog
been
hurt
and
it
suffering
something
terrible
i
want
a
gun
to
put
the
poor
thing
out
of
its
pain
why
yes
of
course
how
would
a
shotgun
do
blake
hartley
asked
you
would
want
anything
heavy
gutchall
fidgeted
why
er
i
was
hoping
you
let
me
have
a
little
gun
he
held
his
hands
about
six
inches
apart
a
pistol
that
i
could
put
in
my
pocket
it
would
look
right
to
carry
a
hunting
gun
on
the
lord
day
people
would
understand
that
it
was
for
a
work
of
mercy
the
lawyer
nodded
in
view
of
gutchall
religious
beliefs
the
objection
made
sense
well
i
have
a
colt
he
said
but
you
know
i
belong
to
this
auxiliary
police
outfit
if
i
were
called
out
for
duty
this
evening
i
need
it
how
soon
could
you
bring
it
back
something
clicked
in
allan
hartley
mind
he
remembered
now
what
that
incident
had
been
he
knew
too
what
he
had
to
do
dad
are
there
some
cartridges
left
for
the
luger
he
asked
blake
hartley
snapped
his
fingers
by
george
yes
i
have
a
german
automatic

can
let
you
have
but
i
wish
you
bring
it
back
as
soon
as
possible
i
get
it
for
you
before
he
could
rise
allan
was
on
his
feet
sit
still
dad
i
get
it
i
know
where
the
cartridges
are
with
that
he
darted
into
the
house
and
upstairs
the
luger
hung
on
the
wall
over
his
father
bed
getting
it
down
he
dismounted
it
working
with
rapid
precision
he
used
the
blade
of
his
pocketknife
to
unlock
the
endpiece
of
the
breechblock
slipping
out
the
firing
pin
and
buttoning
it
into
his
shirt
pocket
then
he
reassembled
the
harmless
pistol
and
filled
the
clip
with
cartridges
from
the
bureau
drawer
there
was
an
extension
telephone
beside
the
bed
finding
address
in
the
directory
he
lifted
the
telephone
and
stretched
his
handkerchief
over
the
mouthpiece
then
he
dialed
police
headquarters
illustration

is
blake
hartley
he
lied
deepening
his
voice
and
copying
his
father
tone
frank
gutchall

down
he
gave
gutchall

a

there
is
time

it
for
granted
that

do
i
disabled
the
pistol
took
out
the
firing
pin
but
if
he
finds
out
what
i
did
he
may

on

on

like
to
lose
it
we
take
care
of
that
too
thank
you
mr
hartley
he
hung
up
and
carried
the
luger
and
the
loaded
clip
down
to
the
porch
look
gutchall
here
how
it
works
he
said
showing
it
to
the
visitor
then
he
slapped
in
the
clip
and
yanked
up
on
the
toggle
loading
the
chamber
it
ready
to
shoot
now
this
is
the
safety
he
pushed
it
on
when
you
ready
to
shoot
just
shove
it
forward
and
up
and
then
pull
the
trigger
you
have
to
pull
the
trigger
each
time
loaded
for
eight
shots
and
be
sure
to
put
the
safety
back
when
through
shooting
did
you
load
the
chamber
blake
hartley
demanded
sure
it
on
safe
now
let
me
see
his
father
took
the
pistol
being
careful
to
keep
his
finger
out
of
the
trigger
guard
and
looked
at
it
yes
that
all
right
he
repeated
the
instructions
allan
had
given
stressing
the
importance
of
putting
the
safety
on
after
using
understand
how
it
works
now
he
asked
yes
i
understand
how
it
works
thank
you
hartley
thank
you
too
young
man
gutchall
put
the
luger
in
his
hip
pocket
made
sure
it
would
fall
out
and
took
his
departure
you
should
have
loaded
it
hartley
reproved
when
he
was
gone
allan
sighed
this
was
it
the
masquerade
was
over
i
had
to
to
keep
you
from
fooling
with
it
he
said
i
did
want
you
finding
out
that
i
taken
out
the
firing
pin
you
what
gutchall
did
want
that
gun
to
shoot
a
dog
he
has
no
dog
he
meant
to
shoot
his
wife
with
it
he
a
religious
maniac
sees
visions
hears
voices
receives
revelations
talks
with
the
holy
ghost
the
holy
ghost
probably
put
him
up
to
this
caper
i
submit
that
any
man
who
holds
long
conversations
with
the
deity
is
to
be
trusted
with
a
gun
and
neither
is
any
man
who
lies
about
why
he
wants
one
and
while
i
was
at
it
i
called
the
police
on
the
upstairs
phone
i
had
to
use
your
name
i
deepened
my
voice
and
talked
through
a
handkerchief
you
blake
hartley
jumped
as
though
why
did
you
have
to
do
that
you
know
why
i
could
have
told
them
is
little
allan
hartley
just
thirteen
years
old
please
policeman
go
and
arrest
frank
gutchall
before
he
goes
at
his
wife
with
my
luger
that
would
have
gone
over
big
now
would
it
and
suppose
he
really
wants
to
shoot
a
dog
what
sort
of
a
mess
will
i
be
in
no
mess
at
all
if
i
wrong
which
i
not
i
take
the
thump
for
it
myself
it
pass
for
a
dumb
kid
trick
and
nothing
be
done
but
if
i
right
you
have
to
front
for
me
they
keep
your
name
out
of
it
but
they
give
me
a
lot
of
cheap
publicity
which
i
want
he
picked
up
his
pencil
again
we
should
have
the
complete
returns
in
about
twenty
minutes
that
was
a
and
it
was
another
before
the
who
returned
the
luger
had
finished
congratulating
blake
hartley
and
giving
him
the
thanks
of
the
department
after
he
had
gone
the
lawyer
picked
up
the
luger
withdrew
the
clip
and
ejected
the
round
in
the
chamber
well
he
told
his
son
you
were
right
you
saved
that
woman
life
he
looked
at
the
automatic
and
then
handed
it
across
the
table
now
let
see
you
put
that
firing
pin
back
allan
hartley
dismantled
the
weapon
inserted
the
missing
part
and
put
it
together
again
then
snapped
it
experimentally
and
returned
it
to
his
father
blake
hartley
looked
at
it
again
and
laid
it
on
the
table
now
son
suppose
we
have
a
little
talk
he
said
softly
but
i
explained
everything
allan
objected
innocently
you
did
not
his
father
retorted
yesterday
you
never
have
thought
of
a
trick
like
this
why
you
would
even
have
known
how
to
take
this
pistol
apart
and
at
dinner
i
caught
you
using
language
and
expressing
ideas
that
were
entirely
outside
anything
you
ever
known
before
now
i
want
to
know
and
i
mean
this
literally
allan
chuckled
i
hope
you
not
toying
with
the
rather
medieval
notion
of
obsession
he
said
blake
hartley
started
something
very
like
that
must
have
been
flitting
through
his
mind
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
then
closed
it
abruptly
the
trouble
is
i
not
sure
you
are
right
his
son
continued
you
say
you
find
me
changed
when
did
you
first
notice
a
difference
last
night
you
were
still
my
little
boy
this
morning
blake
hartley
was
talking
more
to
himself
than
to
allan
i
do
know
you
were
unusually
silent
at
breakfast
and
come
to
think
of
it
there
was
something
something
strange
about
you
when
i
saw
you
in
the
hall
upstairs
allan
he
burst
out
vehemently
what
has
happened
to
you
allan
hartley
felt
a
twinge
of
pain
what
his
father
was
going
through
was
almost
what
he
himself
had
endured
in
the
first
few
minutes
after
waking
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
myself
dad
he
said
you
see
when
i
woke
this
morning
i
had
the
least
recollection
of
anything
i
done
yesterday
august
that
is
he
specified
i
was
positively
convinced
that
i
was
a
man
of
and
my
last
memory
was
of
lying
on
a
stretcher
injured
by
a
bomb
explosion
and
i
was
equally
convinced
that
this
had
happened
in
huh
his
father
straightened
did
you
say
nineteen
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
right
in
you
will
be
a
bomb
you
say
allan
nodded
during
the
siege
of
buffalo
in
the
third
world
war
he
said
i
was
a
captain
in
scientific
warfare
general
staff
been
a
transpolar
air
invasion
of
canada
and
i
been
sent
to
the
front
to
check
on
service
failures
of
a
new
lubricating
oil
for
combat
equipment
a
week
after
i
got
there
ottawa
fell
and
the
retreat
started
we
made
a
stand
at
buffalo
and
that
was
where
i
copped
it
i
remember
being
picked
up
and
getting
a
narcotic
injection
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
in
bed
upstairs
and
it
was
again
and
i
was
back
in
my
own
little
body
oh
allan
you
just
had
a
nightmare
to
end
nightmares
his
father
assured
him
laughing
a
trifle
too
heartily
that
all
that
was
one
of
the
first
things
i
thought
of
i
had
to
reject
it
it
just
would
fit
the
facts
look
a
normal
dream
is
part
of
the
dreamer
own
physical
brain
is
it
well
here
is
a
part
about
two
thousand
per
cent
greater
than
the
whole
from
which
it
was
taken
which
is
absurd
you
mean
all
this
battle
of
buffalo
stuff
that
easy
all
the
radio
commentators
have
been
harping
on
the
horrors
of
world
war
iii
and
you
could
have
avoided
hearing
some
of
it
you
just
have
an
undigested
chunk
of
kaltenborn
raising
hell
in
your
subconscious
it
was
just
world
war
iii
it
was
everything
my
four
years
at
high
school
and
my
four
years
at
penn
state
and
my
seven
years
as
a
reporter
on
the
philadelphia
record
and
my
novels
of
the
of
they
were
no
kid
stuff
why
yesterday
i
never
even
have
thought
of
some
of
the
ideas
i
used
in
my
detective
stories
that
i
published
under
a
and
my
hobby
chemistry
i
was
pretty
good
at
that
patented
a
couple
of
processes
that
made
me
as
much
money
as
my
writing
you
think
a
just
dreamed
all
that
up
or
here
you
speak
french
do
you
he
switched
languages
and
spoke
at
some
length
in
good
conversational
parisian
too
bad
you
do
speak
spanish
too
he
added
reverting
to
english
except
for
a
mexican
accent
you
could
cut
with
a
machete
i
even
better
there
than
in
french
and
i
know
some
german
and
a
little
russian
blake
hartley
was
staring
at
his
son
stunned
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
make
himself
speak
i
could
barely
keep
up
with
you
in
french
he
admitted
i
can
swear
that
in
the
last
thirteen
years
of
your
life
you
had
absolutely
no
chance
to
learn
it
all
right
you
lived
till
you
say
then
all
of
a
sudden
you
found
yourself
back
here
thirteen
years
old
in
i
suppose
you
remember
everything
in
between
he
asked
did
you
ever
read
james
branch
cabell
remember
florian
de
puysange
in
high
place
yes
you
find
the
same
idea
in
too
allan
said
you
know
i
beginning
to
wonder
if
cabell
might
have
known
something
he
did
want
to
write
but
it
impossible
blake
hartley
hit
the
table
with
his
hand
so
hard
that
the
heavy
pistol
bounced
the
loose
round
he
had
ejected
from
the
chamber
toppled
over
and
started
to
roll
falling
off
the
edge
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
how
can
you
go
back
against
time
and
the
time
you
claim
you
came
from
does
exist
now
it
has
happened
yet
he
reached
for
the
pistol
magazine
to
insert
the
cartridge
and
as
he
did
he
saw
the
books
in
front
of
his
son
dunne
with
time
he
commented
and
tyrrell
and
psychical
phenomena
are
you
trying
to
work
out
a
theory
yes
it
encouraged
allan
to
see
that
his
father
had
unconsciously
adopted
an
manner
i
think
i
getting
somewhere
too
you
read
these
books
well
look
dad
what
your
attitude
on
precognition
the
ability
of
the
human
mind
to
exhibit
real
knowledge
apart
from
logical
inference
of
future
events
you
think
dunne
is
telling
the
truth
about
his
experiences
or
that
the
cases
in
book
are
properly
verified
and
ca
be
explained
away
on
the
basis
of
chance
blake
hartley
frowned
i
do
know
he
confessed
the
evidence
is
the
sort
that
any
court
in
the
world
would
accept
if
it
concerned
ordinary
normal
events
especially
the
cases
investigated
by
the
society
for
psychical
research
they
been
verified
but
how
can
anybody
know
of
something
that
has
happened
yet
if
it
happened
yet
it
does
exist
and
you
ca
have
real
knowledge
of
something
that
has
no
real
existence
tyrrell
discusses
that
dilemma
and
does
dispose
of
it
i
think
i
can
if
somebody
has
real
knowledge
of
the
future
then
the
future
must
be
available
to
the
present
mind
and
if
any
moment
other
than
the
bare
present
exists
then
all
time
must
be
totally
present
every
moment
must
be
perpetually
coexistent
with
every
other
moment
allan
said
illustration
yes
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean
that
was
dunne
idea
was
it
no
dunne
postulated
an
infinite
series
of
time
dimensions
the
entire
extent
of
each
being
the
bare
present
moment
of
the
next
what
postulating
is
the
perpetual
coexistence
of
every
moment
of
time
in
this
dimension
just
as
every
graduation
on
a
yardstick
exists
equally
with
every
other
graduation
but
each
at
a
different
point
in
space
well
as
far
as
duration
and
sequence
go
that
all
right
the
father
agreed
but
how
about
the
of
time
well
time
appear
to
pass
so
does
the
landscape
you
see
from
a
moving
car
window
i
suggest
that
both
are
illusions
of
the
same
kind
we
imagine
time
to
be
dynamic
because
we
never
viewed
it
from
a
fixed
point
but
if
it
is
totally
present
then
it
must
be
static
and
in
that
case
we
moving
through
time
that
seems
all
right
but
what
your
car
window
if
all
time
is
totally
present
then
you
must
exist
simultaneously
at
every
moment
along
your
individual
life
span
allan
said
your
physical
body
and
your
mind
and
all
the
thoughts
contained
in
your
mind
each
at
its
appropriate
moment
in
sequence
but
what
is
it
that
exists
only
at
the
bare
moment
we
think
of
as
blake
hartley
grinned
already
he
was
accepting
his
small
son
as
an
intellectual
equal
please
teacher
what
your
consciousness
and
do
say
that
teacher
does
know
but
we
only
conscious
of
one
moment
the
illusory
now
this
is
and
it
was
when
you
asked
that
question
and
it
be
when
i
stop
talking
but
each
is
a
different
moment
we
imagine
that
all
those
nows
are
rushing
past
us
really
they
standing
still
and
our
consciousness
is
whizzing
past
them
his
father
thought
that
over
for
some
time
then
he
sat
up
hey
he
cried
suddenly
if
some
part
of
our
ego
is
and
passes
from
moment
to
moment
it
must
be
extraphysical
because
the
physical
body
exists
at
every
moment
through
which
the
consciousness
passes
and
if
it
extraphysical
there
no
reason
whatever
for
assuming
that
it
passes
out
of
existence
when
it
reaches
the
moment
of
the
death
of
the
body
why
there
logical
evidence
for
survival
independent
of
any
alleged
spirit
communication
you
can
toss
out
patience
worth
and
osborne
leonard
feda
and
sir
oliver
lodge
son
and
wilfred
brandon
and
all
the
other
and
you
still
have
evidence
i
had
thought
of
that
allan
confessed
i
think
you
right
well
let
put
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
agenda
and
get
on
with
this
time
business
you
consciousness
as
in
sleep
where
does
your
consciousness
go
i
think
it
simply
detaches
from
the
moment
at
which
you
go
to
sleep
and
moves
backward
or
forward
along
the
line
of
to
some
prior
or
subsequent
moment
attaching
there
well
why
do
we
know
anything
about
that
blake
hartley
asked
it
never
seems
to
happen
we
go
to
sleep
tonight
and
it
always
tomorrow
morning
when
we
wake
never
or
last
month
or
next
year
it
never
or
almost
never
to
happen
you
right
there
know
why
because
if
the
consciousness
goes
forward
it
attaches
at
a
moment
when
the
physical
brain
contains
memories
of
the
previous
consciously
unexperienced
moment
you
wake
remembering
the
evening
before
because
that
the
memory
contained
in
your
mind
at
that
moment
and
back
of
it
are
memories
of
all
the
events
in
the
interim
see
yes
but
how
about
backward
movement
like
this
experience
of
yours
this
experience
of
mine
may
not
be
unique
but
i
never
heard
of
another
case
like
it
what
usually
happens
is
that
the
memories
carried
back
by
the
consciousness
are
buried
in
the
subconscious
mind
you
know
how
thick
the
wall
between
the
subconscious
and
the
conscious
mind
is
these
dreams
of
dunne
and
the
cases
in
tyrrell
book
are
leakage
why
precognitions
are
usually
incomplete
and
distorted
and
generally
trivial
the
wonder
is
that
good
cases
are
so
few
it
surprising
that
there
are
any
at
all
allan
looked
at
the
papers
in
front
of
him
i
have
begun
to
theorize
about
how
i
managed
to
remember
everything
it
may
have
been
the
radiations
from
the
bomb
or
the
effect
of
the
narcotic
or
both
together
or
something
at
this
end
or
a
combination
of
all
three
but
the
fact
remains
that
my
subconscious
barrier
function
and
everything
got
through
so
you
see
i
am
obsessed
by
my
own
future
identity
and
i
been
afraid
that
you
been
well
by
some
some
outsider
blake
hartley
grinned
weakly
i
do
mind
admitting
allan
that
what
happened
has
been
a
shock
but
that
other
i
just
could
have
taken
that
no
not
and
stayed
sane
but
really
i
am
your
son
the
same
entity
i
was
yesterday
i
just
had
what
you
might
call
an
educational
short
cut
i
say
you
have
his
father
laughed
in
real
amusement
he
discovered
that
his
cigar
had
gone
out
and
it
here
if
you
can
remember
the
next
thirty
years
suppose
you
tell
me
when
the
war
going
to
end
this
one
i
mean
the
japanese
surrender
will
be
announced
at
exactly
present
style
on
august
a
week
from
tuesday
better
make
sure
we
have
plenty
of
grub
in
the
house
by
then
everything
will
be
closed
up
tight
till
thursday
morning
even
the
restaurants
i
remember
we
had
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
but
some
scraps
well
it
is
handy
having
a
prophet
in
the
family
i
see
to
it
stauber
gets
plenty
of
groceries
in
tuesday
a
week
that
pretty
sudden
is
it
the
japs
are
going
to
think
so
allan
replied
he
went
on
to
describe
what
was
going
to
happen
his
father
swore
softly
you
know
i
heard
talk
about
atomic
energy
but
i
thought
it
was
just
buck
rogers
stuff
was
that
the
sort
of
bomb
that
got
you
that
was
a
firecracker
to
the
bomb
that
got
me
that
thing
exploded
a
good
ten
miles
away
blake
hartley
whistled
softly
and
that
going
to
happen
in
thirty
years
you
know
son
if
i
were
you
i
would
like
to
have
to
know
about
a
thing
like
that
he
looked
at
allan
for
a
moment
please
if
you
know
do
ever
tell
me
when
i
going
to
die
allan
smiled
i
ca
i
had
a
letter
from
you
just
before
i
left
for
the
front
you
were
then
and
you
were
still
hunting
and
fishing
and
flying
your
own
plane
but
i
not
going
to
get
killed
in
any
battle
of
buffalo
this
time
and
if
i
can
prevent
it
and
i
think
i
can
there
wo
be
any
world
war
iii
but
you
say
all
time
exists
perpetually
coexistent
and
totally
present
his
father
said
then
it
right
there
in
front
of
you
and
you
getting
closer
to
it
every
watch
tick
allan
hartley
shook
his
head
you
know
what
i
remembered
when
frank
gutchall
came
to
borrow
a
gun
he
asked
well
the
other
time
i
had
been
home
i
been
swimming
at
the
canoe
club
with
larry
morton
when
i
got
home
about
half
an
hour
from
now
i
found
the
house
full
of
cops
gutchall
talked
the
officers
model
out
of
you
and
gone
home
he
shot
his
wife
four
times
through
the
body
finished
her
off
with
another
one
back
of
the
ear
and
then
used
his
sixth
shot
to
blast
his
brains
out
the
cops
traced
the
gun
they
took
a
very
poor
view
of
your
lending
it
to
him
you
never
got
it
back
trust
that
gang
to
keep
a
good
gun
the
lawyer
said
i
did
want
us
to
lose
it
this
time
and
i
did
want
to
see
you
lose
face
around
city
hall
gutchalls
of
course
are
expendable
allan
said
but
my
main
reason
for
fixing
frank
gutchall
up
with
a
padded
cell
was
that
i
wanted
to
know
whether
or
not
the
future
could
be
altered
i
have
it
on
experimental
authority
that
it
can
be
there
must
be
additional
dimensions
of
time
lines
of
alternate
probabilities
something
like
william
seabrook
friend
when
i
brought
memories
of
the
future
back
to
the
present
i
added
certain
factors
to
the
causal
chain
that
set
up
an
entirely
new
line
of
probabilities
on
no
notice
at
all
i
stopped
a
murder
and
a
suicide
with
thirty
years
to
work
i
can
stop
a
world
war
i
have
the
means
to
do
it
too
the
means
unlimited
wealth
and
influence
here
allan
picked
up
a
sheet
and
handed
it
to
his
father
used
properly
we
can
make
two
or
three
million
on
that
alone
a
list
of
all
the
kentucky
derby
preakness
and
belmont
winners
to
that
furnish
us
primary
capital
then
remember
i
was
something
of
a
chemist
i
took
it
up
originally
to
get
background
material
for
one
of
my
detective
stories
it
fascinated
me
and
i
made
it
a
hobby
and
then
a
source
of
income
i
thirty
years
ahead
of
any
chemist
in
the
world
now
you
remember
ten
years
from
now
we
make
them
look
like
pikers
his
father
looked
at
the
yellow
sheet
assault
at
eight
to
one
he
said
i
can
scrape
up
about
five
thousand
for
that
yes
in
ten
years
any
other
little
operations
you
have
in
mind
he
asked
about
we
start
building
a
political
organization
here
in
pennsylvania
in
i
think
we
can
elect
you
president
the
world
situation
will
be
crucial
by
that
time
and
we
had
a
nonentity
in
the
white
house
then
who
let
things
go
till
war
became
inevitable
i
think
president
hartley
can
be
trusted
to
take
a
strong
line
of
policy
in
the
meantime
you
can
read
machiavelli
that
my
little
boy
talking
blake
hartley
said
softly
all
right
son
i
do
just
what
you
tell
me
and
when
you
grow
up
i
be
president
let
go
get
supper
now
the
end
