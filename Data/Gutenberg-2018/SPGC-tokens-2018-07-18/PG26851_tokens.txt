to

more
successful
novel
school
which
told
about
tom
at
the
rugby
school
from
the
age
of
to
now
tom
is
at
oxford
university
for
a
three
year
program
of
study
in
which
he
attends
class
lectures
and
does
independent
reading
with
a
tutor
a
student
in
residence
at
oxford
is
said
to
be
up
or
have
come
up
and
one
who
leaves
is
said
to
have
gone
down
the
author
weaves
a
picture
of
life
at
oxford
university
in
the
where
he
himself
was
at
that
time
at
oriel
college
where
he
excelled
in
sports
rather
than
academics
the
university
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
separate
colleges
and
the
students
form
friendships
within
and
develop
a
loyalty
to
their
own
college
tom
college
ambrose
is
fictional
the
study
programs
available
to
the
students
are
intended
to
prepare
them
for
the
legal
ecclesiastical
medical
and
educational
professions
students
who
do
poorly
might
be
expected
to
enter
the
diplomatic
corps
or
the
army
or
navy
though
a
son
of
the
aristocracy
might
be
thrust
into
a
minor
church
role
to
enter
into
business
or
manufacturing
engineering
or
the
research
sciences
would
require
an
inheritance
or
family
connection
latin
was
still
taught
because
the
best
literature
available
to
them
was
still
the
ancient
greek
and
roman
poets
and
philosophers
and
the
legal
and
medical
professions
still
used
it
extensively
though
the
ecclesiastical
and
educational
fields
had
largely
abandoned
it
tom
finds
that
there
is
a
social
barrier
between
the
wealthy
students
and
the
students
that
are
there
on
the
equivalent
of
a
modern
academic
scholarship
or
have
to
work
as
a
graduate
student
tutor
to
earn
their
stipend
there
were
no
sports
scholarships
at
this
time
though
the
author
hints
vaguely
at
one
point
that
someday
the
idea
could
be
explored
there
were
no
female
students
at
this
time
tom
becomes
involved
with
a
local
barmaid
the
barmaid
being
of
a
different
social
class
than
tom
this
relationship
causes
problems
for
both
of
them
and
it
is
important
for
the
modern
reader
to
realize
that
such
social
distinctions
were
very
real
and
inflexible
in
those
days
the
working
class
referred
to
the
educated
class
as
their
betters
meaning
better
educated
and
entitled
to
better
respect
regardless
of
whether
it
was
earned
or
deserved
there
were
no
dormitories
and
cafeterias
as
with
modern
colleges
instead
meals
were
served
in
a
dining
hall
by
scouts
and
each
student
gets
what
are
called
rooms
consisting
of
a
bedroom
and
a
sitting
room
for
study
and
entertaining
scouts
are
a
kind
of
servant
attached
to
one
student
or
a
small
number
of
students
they
run
errands
bring
meals
from
the
kitchen
and
take
care
of
clothing
a
bootblack
called
the
boots
takes
care
of
footwear
a
charwoman
called
the
char
cleaned
the
rooms
if
a
student
wished
to
study
without
interruption
he
would
close
the
oak
door
to
his
rooms
which
was
called
sporting
his
oak
the
signal
not
to
disturb
the
term
the
eleven
refers
to
the
cricket
team
and
refers
to
students
who
win
prizes
for
scholarship
hunting
pinks
are
red
riding
jackets
and
hunters
are
horses
especially
suited
to
steeplechase
or
fox
hunting
type
riding
the
boating
club
and
boat
racing
is
the
popular
sport
of
crew
rowing
or
sculling
where
each
college
appoints
a
crew
of
eight
strong
scull
pullers
or
oarsmen
and
one
small
coxswain
or
steersman
to
pilot
a
long
narrow
boat
called
a
skiff
or
shell
the
coxswain
calls
the
strokes
and
is
generally
the
coach
and
commander
of
the
crew
unlike
in
a
canoe
the
pullers
face
backwards
and
the
one
nearest
the
coxswain
is
called
the
stroke
oar
because
all
the
other
oars
watch
him
and
match
his
stroke
the
racing
takes
place
on
the
river
which
runs
through
oxford
and
since
because
of
the
oars
the
river
is
too
narrow
for
normal
passing
as
in
most
other
kinds
of
racing
the
race
is
sometimes
with
just
two
boats
one
ahead
of
the
other
if
the
prow
of
the
second
boat
touches
the
stern
of
the
first
boat
the
second
boat
is
considered
the
winner
and
advances
in
ranking
if
the
first
boat
rows
the
length
of
the
course
without
being
bumped
it
is
considered
the
winner
and
maintains
its
ranking
sometimes
the
winning
crewmen
put
their
little
coxswain
in
the
boat
and
parade
him
through
the
streets
of
the
town
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
honor
of
head
of
the
river
belongs
to
the
boat
that
has
not
been
defeated
and
is
presumably
the
fastest
whereas
the
slowest
boat
tail
end
charlie
has
been
defeated
by
all
the
other
colleges

of

the

the
nineteenth
century

humorous
three
men

in
which

students
were
required
to
wear
the
traditional
student
gown
and
mortarboard
cap
to
classes
professors
wore
floppy
caps
and
similar
gowns
with
indications
of
their
rank
on
the
sleeves
doctor
master
or
batchelor
this
garb
dates
from
the
middle
ages
but
is
now
only
seen
at
graduation
day
and
special
university
occasions
and
the
gown
has
survived
in
some
church
choirs
a
professor
was
also
called
a
don
and
graduate
assistants
were
called
fellows
or
servitors
the
tufts
or
students
from
the
nobility
or
titled
families
were
a
privileged
set
paid
double
fees
and
were
not
required
to
do
much
of
anything
academically
were
from
the
untitled
but
wealthy
families
and
also
paid
double
fees
a
few
students
from
poorer
social
classes
were
accepted
if
they
had
good
references
town
and
gown
refers
to
the
animosity
between
the
local
permanent
residents
of
the
town
and
the
rowdy
students
occasionally
descending
into
actual
fist
fights
to
be
gated
was
to
be
confined
to
college
and
to
be
rusticated
was
to
be
suspended
from
college
a
wine
is
the
nineteenth
century
equivalent
of
a
student
beer
and
pizza
party
though
it
seems
to
have
been
paid
for
entirely
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
host
it
is
also
a
form
of
student
networking
wherein
they
build
relationships
useful
for
their
future
business
professional
or
social
life
german
university
students
joined
a
kadet
korps
which
was
somewhat
like
a
combination
of
a
modern
day
fraternity
and
officer
training
corps
but
no
such
equivalent
seems
to
have
been
at
oxford
instead
there
was
an
academic
set
called
the
reading
men
which
buckled
down
to
the
books
and
a
set
of
fast
men
who
lived
the
dissipated
high
life
of
drinking
gambling
women
and
riding
fast
horses
the
fast
set
though
they
were
gentleman
commoners
and
not
titled
nobility
usually
were
from
wealthy
families
and
often
ran
up
large
bills
with
the
local
tradesmen
called
going
tick
which
could
go
unpaid
for
quite
a
long
time
in
chapter
the
author
mentions
big
ben
but
this
is
not
the
clock
tower
bell
in
london
which
at
the
time
of
writing
had
not
yet
been
rung
instead
this
is
benjamin
caunt
the
boxer
who
defeated
william
thompson
in
rounds
to
become
heavyweight
champion
of
england
in
the
bell
may
possibly
have
been
named
after
him
it
should
be
remembered
that
at
the
time
this
story
was
written
the
dangers
of
tobacco
smoke
were
mostly
unknown
and
cigars
cheroots
and
pipes
were
quite
commonly
used
though
the
cigarette
had
not
come
into
use
yet
tobacco
often
called
weed
was
only
discouraged
during
physical
training
thus
at
one
point
in
chapter
tom
recommends
smoking
to
hardy
for
an
almost
therapeutic
purpose
in
chapter
the
author
imagines
a
flying
machine
though
at
the
time
of
writing
only
balloons
had
ever
carried
men
aloft
he
imagines
it
something
like
a
carriage
equipped
to
carry
passengers
with
the
most
comfortable
carriage
type
steam
powered
and
faster
than
the
latest
trains
which
at
that
time
went
miles
per
hour
the
fastest
speed
that
anyone
had
ever
achieved
the
author
mentions
tractarians
and
germanizers
the
tractarians
were
a
group
of
oxford
dons
who
in
the
wrote
a
series
of
tracts
aimed
at
proposing
some
changes
to
the
theological
system
of
the
anglican
church
germanizers
proposed
some
changes
more
along
the
lines
of
the
lutheran
theology
and
these
controversies
occupied
the
anglican
theologians
of
the
time
the
author
did
not
expand
on
these
subjects
nor
even
indicate
his
support
or
opposition
to
them
as
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
story
at
this
time
as
in
many
other
times
the
evangelical
christians
were
in
the
forefront
of
movements
to
help
poor
and
downtrodden
people
but
other
elements
were
attempting
to
become
involved
promoting
their
own
methods
and
beliefs
karl
marx
was
not
known
in
england
and
the
russian
revolution
was
still
in
the
distant
future
but
a
few
radical
idealists
know
as
chartists
and
swings
were
beginning
to
be
heard
on
campus
and
tom
gets
briefly
involved
with
them
speaking
up
for
the
poor
but
realizes
their
destructive
ideas
can
not
be
reconciled
with
proper
christian
behavior
thus
voicing
some
of
the
author
views
on
social
reforms
the
author
later
in
life
got
involved
with
a
communal
living
experiment
some
words
and
expressions
are
used
differently
today
than
they
were
used
in
the
nineteenth
century
for
example
when
tom
says
there
must
always
be
some
blackguards
he
means
regrettably
there
will
always
be
blackguards
not
we
ought
to
have
some
blackguards
katie
and
tom
discuss
profane
poetry
in
the
sense
of
being
secular
and
not
sacred
or
religious
mary
weighs
stone
which
is
pounds
or
kilograms
and
famously
is
used
in
the
sense
of
being
well
done
not
in
the
incorrect
modern
use
of
being
well
known
a
screw
is
the
propeller
of
a
steam
launch
to
give
someone
a
character
is
to
speak
or
write
about
their
moral
character
either
favorably
or
slanderously
the
book
which
i
scanned
using
optical
character
recognition
was
printed
in
the
period
by
john
lovell
of
worth
new
york
lovell
has
been
described
as
a
book
pirate
who
tried
to
form
a
monopoly
in
the
cheap
uncopyrighted
book
trade
the
us
copyright
laws
were
rather
weak
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
charles
dickens
was
particularly
hurt
by
pirates
there
was
even
a
book
war
with
rival
publishers
of
the
same
book
undercutting
each
other
on
price
proof
reading
was
done
with
another
copy
of
the
book
published
in
by
porter
coates
of
philadelphia
which
is
in
poorer
condition
with
water
damage
and
would
not
scan
well
but
has
fewer
typesetting
errors
nineteenth
century
punctuation
made
much
more
use
of
commas
hyphens
and
semicolons
and
these
have
been
retained
as
much
as
possible
british
spellings
of
words
such
as
colour
neighbour
odour
and
flavour
are
retained
though
in
some
cases
the
american
publisher
seems
to
have
made
his
own
corrections
as
he
saw
fit
and
some
words
such
as
connection
have
retained
the
nineteenth
century
spelling
connexion
but
where
a
word
was
obviously
spelled
wrong
by
the
typesetter
i
have
corrected
it
the
author
used
a
few
greek
words
which
do
not
scan
and
i
have
entered
those
manually
using
symbol
font
for
the
rtf
file
but
substituted
normal
characters
for
the
plain
txt
file
and
indicated
greek
text
where
appropriate
the
english
pound
symbol
can
not
be
expressed
in
ascii
so
pounds
is
rendered
as
words
printed
in
italics
for
emphasis
are
here
rendered

in

fellow

in

of
ever

this

by
the
author
preface
prefaces
written
to
explain
the
objects
and
meaning
of
a
book
or
to
make
any
appeal
or
other
in
its
favor
are
in
my
opinion
nuisances
any
book
worth
reading
will
explain
its
own
objects
and
meaning
and
the
more
it
is
criticized
and
turned
inside
out
the
better
for
it
and
its
author
of
all
books
too
it
seems
to
me
that
novels
require
prefaces
least
at
any
rate
on
their
first
appearance
notwithstanding
which
belief
i
must
ask
readers
for
three
minutes
patience
before
they
make
trial
of
this
book
the
natural
pleasure
which
i
felt
at
the
unlooked
for
popularity
of
the
first
part
of
the
present
story
was
much
lessened
by
the
pertinacity
with
which
many
persons
acquaintance
as
well
as
strangers
would
insist
both
in
public
and
in
private
on
identifying
the
hero
and
the
author
on
the
appearance
of
the
first
few
numbers
of
the
present
continuation
in
magazine
the
same
thing
occurred
and
in
fact
reached
such
a
pitch
as
to
lead
me
to
make
some
changes
to
the
story
sensitiveness
on
such
a
point
may
seem
folly
but
if
the
readers
had
felt
the
sort
of
loathing
and
disgust
which
one
feels
at
the
notion
of
painting
a
favorable
likeness
of
oneself
in
a
work
of
fiction
they
would
not
wonder
at
it
so
now
that
this
book
is
finished
and
tom
brown
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
is
done
with
for
ever
i
must
take
this
my
first
and
last
chance
of
saying
that
he
is
not
i
either
as
boy
or
man
in
fact
not
to
beat
about
the
bush
is
a
much
braver
and
nobler
and
purer
fellow
than
i
ever
was
when
i
first
resolved
to
write
the
book
i
tried
to
realize
to
myself
what
the
commonest
type
of
english
boy
of
the
upper
middle
class
was
so
far
as
my
experience
went
and
to
that
type
i
have
throughout
adhered
trying
simply
to
give
a
good
specimen
of
the
genus
i
certainly
have
placed
him
in
the
country
and
scenes
which
i
know
best
myself
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
knew
them
better
than
any
others
and
therefore
was
less
likely
to
blunder
in
writing
about
them
as
to
the
name
which
has
been
perhaps
the
chief
cause
of
offense
in
this
matter
the
simple
facts
are
that
i
chose
the
name
brown
because
it
stood
first
in
the
trio
of
brown
jones
and
robinson
which
had
become
a
sort
of
synonym
for
the
middle
classes
of
great
britain
it
happens
that
my
own
name
and
that
of
brown
have
no
single
letter
in
common
as
to
the
christian
name
of
tom
having
chosen
brown
i
could
hardly
help
taking
it
as
the
prefix
the
two
names
have
gone
together
in
england
for
two
hundred
years
and
the
joint
name
has
not
enjoyed
much
of
a
reputation
for
respectability
this
suited
me
exactly
i
wanted
the
name
i
could
get
and
did
not
want
any
name
which
had
the
least
heroic
or
aristocratic
or
even
respectable
savor
about
it
therefore
i
had
a
natural
leaning
to
the
combination
which
i
found
ready
to
my
hand
moreover
i
believed
tom
to
be
a
more
specially
english
name
than
john
the
only
other
as
to
which
i
felt
the
least
doubt
whether
it
be
that
thomas
a
beckett
was
for
so
long
the
favorite
english
saint
or
from
whatever
other
cause
it
certainly
seems
to
be
the
fact
that
the
name
thomas
is
much
commoner
in
england
than
in
any
other
country
the
words
though
perhaps
not
complimentary
to
the
tom
of
england
certainly
show
how
large
a
family
they
must
have
been
these
reasons
decided
me
to
keep
the
christian
name
which
had
been
always
associated
with
brown
and
i
own
that
the
fact
that
it
happened
to
be
my
own
never
occurred
to
me
as
an
objection
till
the
mischief
was
done
past
recall
i
have
only
them
to
say
that
neither
is
the
hero
a
portrait
of
myself
nor
is
there
any
other
portrait
in
either
of
the
books
except
in
the
case
of
arnold
where
the
true
name
is
given
my
deep
feeling
of
gratitude
to
him
and
reverence
for
his
memory
emboldened
me
to
risk
the
attempt
at
a
portrait
in
his
case
so
far
as
the
character
was
necessary
for
the
work
with
these
remarks

tom

at

by
thomas
hughes
chapter
introductory
in
the
michaelmas
term
after
leaving
school
tom
brown
received
a
summons
from
the
authorities
and
went
up
to
matriculate
at
ambrose
college
oxford
he
presented
himself
at
the
college
one
afternoon
and
was
examined
by
one
of
the
tutors
who
carried
him
and
several
other
youths
in
like
predicament
up
to
the
senate
house
the
next
morning
here
they
went
through
the
usual
forms
of
subscribing
to
the
articles
and
otherwise
testifying
their
loyalty
to
the
established
order
of
things
without
much
thought
perhaps
but
in
very
good
faith
nevertheless
having
completed
the
ceremony
by
paying
his
fees
our
hero
hurried
back
home
without
making
any
stay
in
oxford
he
had
often
passed
through
it
so
that
the
city
had
not
the
charm
of
novelty
for
him
and
he
was
anxious
to
get
home
where
as
he
had
never
spent
an
autumn
away
from
school
till
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
having
his
fill
of
hunting
and
shooting
he
had
left
school
in
june
and
did
not
go
up
to
reside
at
oxford
till
the
end
of
the
following
january
seven
good
months
during
a
part
of
which
he
had
indeed
read
for
four
hours
or
so
a
week
with
the
curate
of
the
parish
but
the
residue
had
been
exclusively
devoted
to
cricket
and
field
sports
now
admirable
as
these
institutions
are
and
beneficial
as
is
their
influence
on
the
youth
of
britain
it
is
possible
for
a
youngster
to
get
too
much
of
them
so
it
had
fallen
out
with
our
hero
he
was
a
better
horseman
and
shot
but
the
total
relaxation
of
all
the
healthy
discipline
of
school
the
regular
hours
and
regular
work
to
which
he
had
been
used
for
so
many
years
had
certainly
thrown
him
back
in
other
ways
the
whole
man
had
not
grown
so
that
we
must
not
be
surprised
to
find
him
quite
as
boyish
now
that
we
fall
in
with
him
again
marching
down
to
ambrose
with
a
porter
wheeling
his
luggage
after
him
on
a
truck
as
when
we
left
him
at
the
end
of
his
school
career
tom
was
in
truth
beginning
to
feel
that
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
be
getting
to
regular
work
again
of
some
sort
a
landing
place
is
a
famous
thing
but
it
is
only
enjoyable
for
a
time
by
any
mortal
who
deserves
one
at
all
so
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
unmixed
pleasure
that
he
turned
in
at
the
ambrose
gates
and
inquired
of
the
porter
what
rooms
had
been
allotted
to
him
within
those
venerable
walls
while
the
porter
consulted
his
list
the
great
college
sundial
over
the
lodge
which
had
lately
been
renovated
caught
eye
the
motto
underneath
pereunt
et
imputantur
stood
out
proud
of
its
new
gilding
in
the
bright
afternoon
sun
of
a
frosty
january
day
which
motto
was
raising
sundry
thoughts
in
his
brain
when
the
porter
came
upon
the
right
place
in
his
list
and
directed
him
to
the
end
of
his
journey
no
staircase
second
quadrangle
three
pair
back
in
which
new
home
we
shall
leave
him
to
install
himself
while
we
endeavor
to
give
the
reader
some
notion
of
the
college
itself
chapter
i
ambrose
college
ambrose
college
was
a
one
there
might
have
been
some
seventy
or
eighty
undergraduates
in
residence
when
our
hero
appeared
there
as
a
freshman
of
these
unfortunately
for
the
college
there
were
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
enough
in
fact
with
the
other
men
whom
they
drew
round
them
and
who
lived
pretty
much
as
they
did
to
form
the
largest
and
leading
set
in
the
college
so
the
college
was
decidedly
fast
the
chief
characteristic
of
this
set
was
the
most
reckless
extravagance
of
every
kind
london
wine
merchants
furnished
them
with
liqueurs
at
a
guinea
a
bottle
and
wine
at
five
guineas
a
dozen
oxford
and
london
tailors
vied
with
one
another
in
providing
them
with
quantities
of
the
most
gorgeous
clothing
they
drove
tandems
in
all
directions
scattering
their
ample
allowances
which
they
treated
as
pocket
money
about
roadside
inns
and
oxford
taverns
with
open
hand
and
going
tick
for
everything
which
could
by
possibility
be
booked
their
cigars
cost
two
guineas
a
pound
their
furniture
was
the
best
that
could
be
bought
forced
fruit
and
the
most
rare
preserves
figured
at
their
wine
parties
they
hunted
rode
by
day
played
billiards
until
the
gates
closed
and
then
were
ready
for
unlimited
loo
and
hot
drink
in
their
own
rooms
as
long
as
anyone
could
be
got
to
sit
up
and
play
the
fast
set
then
swamped
and
gave
the
tone
to
the
college
at
which
fact
no
persons
were
more
astonished
and
horrified
than
the
authorities
of
ambrose
that
they
of
all
bodies
in
the
world
should
be
fairly
run
away
with
by
a
set
of
reckless
loose
young
spendthrifts
was
indeed
a
melancholy
and
unprecedented
fact
for
the
body
of
fellows
of
ambrose
was
as
distinguished
for
learning
morality
and
respectability
as
any
in
the
university
the
foundation
was
not
indeed
actually
an
open
one
oriel
at
that
time
alone
enjoyed
this
distinction
but
there
were
a
large
number
of
open
fellowships
and
the
income
of
the
college
was
large
and
the
livings
belonging
to
it
numerous
so
that
the
best
men
from
other
colleges
were
constantly
coming
in
some
of
these
of
a
former
generation
had
been
eminently
successful
in
their
management
of
the
college
the
ambrose
undergraduates
at
one
time
had
carried
off
almost
all
the
university
prizes
and
filled
the
class
lists
while
maintaining
at
the
same
time
the
highest
character
for
manliness
and
gentlemanly
conduct
this
had
lasted
long
enough
to
establish
the
fame
of
the
college
and
great
lords
and
statesmen
had
sent
their
sons
there
had
struggled
to
get
the
names
of
their
best
pupils
on
the
books
in
short
everyone
who
had
a
son
ward
or
pupil
whom
he
wanted
to
push
forward
in
the
world
who
was
meant
to
cut
a
figure
and
take
the
lead
among
men
left
no
stone
unturned
to
get
him
into
ambrose
and
thought
the
first
and
a
very
long
step
gained
when
he
had
succeeded
but
the
governing
bodies
of
colleges
are
always
on
the
change
and
in
the
course
of
things
men
of
other
ideas
came
to
rule
at
ambrose
shrewd
men
of
the
world
men
of
business
some
of
them
with
good
ideas
of
making
the
most
of
their
advantages
who
said
go
to
why
should
we
not
make
the
public
pay
for
the
great
benefits
we
confer
on
them
have
we
not
the
very
best
article
in
the
educational
market
to
supply
almost
a
monopoly
of
it
and
shall
we
not
get
the
highest
price
for
it
so
by
degrees
they
altered
many
things
in
the
college
in
the
first
place
under
their
auspices
increased
and
multiplied
in
fact
the
eldest
sons
of
baronets
even
squires
were
scarcely
admitted
on
any
other
footing
as
these
young
gentlemen
paid
double
fees
to
the
college
and
had
great
expectations
of
all
sorts
it
could
not
be
expected
that
they
should
be
subject
to
quite
the
same
discipline
as
the
common
run
of
men
who
would
have
to
make
their
own
way
in
the
world
so
the
rules
as
to
attendance
at
chapel
and
lectures
though
nominally
the
same
for
them
as
for
commoners
were
in
practice
relaxed
in
their
favour
and
that
they
might
find
all
things
suitable
to
persons
in
their
position
the
kitchen
and
buttery
were
worked
up
to
a
high
state
of
perfection
and
ambrose
from
having
been
one
of
the
most
reasonable
had
come
to
be
about
the
most
expensive
college
in
the
university
these
changes
worked
as
their
promoters
probably
desired
that
they
should
work
and
the
college
was
full
of
rich
men
and
commanded
in
the
university
the
sort
of
respect
which
riches
bring
with
them
but
the
old
reputation
though
still
strong
out
of
doors
was
beginning
sadly
to
wane
within
the
university
precincts
fewer
and
fewer
of
the
ambrose
men
appeared
in
the
class
lists
or
amongst
the
they
no
longer
led
the
debates
at
the
union
the
boat
lost
place
after
place
on
the
river
the
eleven
got
beaten
in
all
their
matches
the
inaugurators
of
these
changes
had
passed
away
in
their
turn
and
at
last
a
reaction
had
commenced
the
fellows
recently
elected
and
who
were
in
residence
at
the
time
we
write
of
were
for
the
most
part
men
of
great
attainments
all
of
them
men
who
had
taken
very
high
honors
the
electors
naturally
enough
had
chosen
them
as
the
most
likely
persons
to
restore
as
tutors
the
golden
days
of
the
college
and
they
had
been
careful
in
the
selection
to
confine
themselves
to
very
quiet
and
studious
men
such
as
were
likely
to
remain
up
at
oxford
passing
over
men
of
more
popular
manners
and
active
spirits
who
would
be
sure
to
flit
soon
into
the
world
and
be
of
little
more
service
to
ambrose
but
these
were
not
the
men
to
get
any
hold
on
the
fast
set
who
were
now
in
the
ascendant
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
that
they
should
understand
each
other
in
fact
they
were
hopelessly
at
war
and
the
college
was
getting
more
and
more
out
of
gear
in
consequence
what
they
could
do
however
they
were
doing
and
under
their
fostering
care
were
growing
up
a
small
set
including
most
of
the
scholars
who
were
likely
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
to
retrieve
the
college
character
of
the
schools
but
they
were
too
much
like
their
tutors
men
who
did
little
else
but
read
they
neither
wished
for
nor
were
likely
to
gain
the
slightest
influence
on
the
fast
set
the
best
men
amongst
them
too
were
diligent
readers
of
the
for
the
and
followers
of
the
able
leaders
of
the
party
which
was
then
a
growing
one
and
this
led
them
also
to
form
such
friendships
as
they
made
amongst
men
of
their
own
way
of
high
churchmen
rather
than
ambrose
men
so
they
lived
very
much
to
themselves
and
scarcely
interfered
with
the
dominant
party
lastly
there
was
the
boating
set
which
was
beginning
to
revive
in
the
college
partly
from
the
natural
disgust
of
any
body
of
young
englishmen
at
finding
themselves
distanced
in
an
exercise
requiring
strength
and
pluck
and
partly
from
the
fact
that
the
captain
for
the
time
being
was
one
of
the
best
oars
in
the
university
boat
and
also
a
deservedly
popular
character
he
was
now
in
his
third
year
of
residence
had
won
the
race
and
had
pulled
seven
in
the
great
yearly
match
with
cambridge
and
by
constant
hard
work
had
managed
to
carry
the
ambrose
boat
up
to
the
fifth
place
on
the
river
he
will
be
introduced
to
you
gentle
reader
when
the
proper
time
comes
at
present
we
are
only
concerned
with
a
view
of
the
college
that
you
may
feel
more
or
less
at
home
in
it
the
boating
set
was
not
so
separate
or
marked
as
the
reading
set
melting
on
one
side
into
and
keeping
up
more
or
less
connexion
with
the
fast
set
and
also
commanding
a
sort
of
half
allegiance
from
most
of
the
men
who
belonged
to
neither
of
the
other
sets
the
minor
divisions
of
which
of
course
there
were
many
need
not
be
particularized
as
the
above
general
classification
will
be
enough
for
the
purposes
of
this
history
our
hero
on
leaving
school
having
bound
himself
solemnly
to
write
all
his
doings
and
thoughts
to
the
friend
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
distance
and
separation
were
to
make
no
difference
whatever
in
their
friendship
this
compact
had
been
made
on
one
of
their
last
evenings
at
rugby
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
room
tom
splicing
the
handle
of
a
favourite
cricket
bat
and
arthur
reading
a
volume
of
raleigh
works
the
doctor
had
lately
been
alluding
to
the
history
of
the
world
and
had
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
amongst
his
pupils
about
the
great
navigator
statesman
soldier
author
and
fine
gentleman
so
raleigh
works
were
seized
on
by
various
voracious
young
readers
and
carried
out
of
the
school
library
and
arthur
was
now
deep
in
a
volume
of
the
miscellanies
curled
up
on
a
corner
of
the
sofa
presently
tom
heard
something
between
a
groan
and
a
protest
and
looking
up
demanded
explanations
in
answer
to
which
arthur
in
a
voice
half
furious
and
half
fearful
read
out
and
be
sure
of
this
thou
shalt
never
find
a
friend
in
thy
young
years
whose
conditions
and
qualities
will
please
thee
after
thou
comest
to
more
discretion
and
judgment
and
then
all
thou
givest
is
lost
and
all
wherein
thou
shalt
trust
such
a
one
will
be
discovered
you
do
mean
that
raleigh
yes
here
it
is
in
his
first
letter
to
his
son
what
a
old
philistine
said
tom
but
it
ca
be
true
do
you
think
said
arthur
and
in
short
after
some
personal
reflections
on
sir
walter
they
then
and
there
resolved
that
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
it
was
not
could
not
and
should
not
be
true
that
they
would
remain
faithful
the
same
to
each
other
and
the
greatest
friends
in
the
world
through
i
know
not
what
separations
trials
and
catastrophes
and
for
the
better
insuring
this
result
a
correspondence
regular
as
the
recurring
months
was
to
be
maintained
it
had
already
lasted
through
the
long
vacation
and
up
to
christmas
without
sensibly
dragging
though
tom
letters
had
been
something
of
the
shortest
in
november
when
he
had
lots
of
shooting
and
two
days
a
week
with
the
hounds
now
however
having
fairly
got
to
oxford
he
determined
to
make
up
for
all
his
first
letter
from
college
taken
in
connexion
with
the
previous
sketch
of
the
place
will
probably
accomplish
the
work
of
introduction
better
than
any
detailed
account
by
a
third
party
and
it
is
therefore
given
here
verbatim
ambrose
oxford
february
my
dear
geordie
according
to
promise
i
write
to
tell
you
how
i
get
on
up
here
and
what
sort
of
a
place
oxford
is
of
course
i
do
know
much
about
it
yet
having
only
been
up
some
weeks
but
you
shall
have
my
first
impressions
well
first
and
foremost
it
an
awfully
idle
place
at
any
rate
for
us
freshmen
fancy
now
i
am
in
twelve
lectures
a
week
of
an
hour
each
greek
testament
first
book
of
herodotus
second
aeneid
and
first
book
of
euclid
there
a
treat
two
hours
a
day
all
over
by
twelve
or
one
at
latest
and
no
extra
work
at
all
in
the
shape
of
copies
of
verses
themes
or
other
exercises
i
think
sometimes
i
back
in
the
lower
fifth
for
we
do
get
through
more
than
we
used
to
do
there
and
if
you
were
to
hear
the
men
construe
it
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
where
on
earth
can
they
have
come
from
unless
they
blunder
on
purpose
as
i
often
think
of
course
i
never
look
at
a
lecture
before
i
go
in
i
know
it
all
nearly
by
heart
so
it
would
be
sheer
waste
of
time
i
hope
i
shall
take
to
reading
something
or
other
by
myself
but
you
know
i
never
was
much
of
a
hand
at
sapping
and
for
the
present
the
light
work
suits
me
well
enough
for
plenty
to
see
and
learn
about
in
this
place
we
keep
very
gentlemanly
hours
chapel
every
morning
at
eight
and
evening
at
seven
you
must
attend
once
a
day
and
twice
on
sundays
at
least
that
the
rule
of
our
college
and
be
in
gates
by
twelve
at
night
besides
which
if
you
a
decently
steady
fellow
you
ought
to
dine
in
hall
perhaps
four
days
a
week
hall
is
at
five
and
now
you
have
the
sum
total
all
the
rest
of
your
time
you
may
just
do
what
you
like
with
so
much
for
our
work
and
hours
now
for
the
place
well
it
a
grand
old
place
certainly
and
i
dare
say
if
a
fellow
goes
straight
in
it
and
gets
creditably
through
his
three
years
he
may
end
by
loving
it
as
much
as
we
do
the
old
and
quadrangle
at
rugby
our
college
is
a
fair
specimen
a
venerable
old
front
of
crumbling
stone
fronting
the
street
into
which
two
or
three
other
colleges
look
also
over
the
gateway
is
a
large
room
where
the
college
examinations
go
on
when
there
are
any
and
as
you
enter
you
pass
the
porters
lodge
where
resides
our
janitor
a
bustling
little
man
with
a
pot
belly
whose
business
it
is
to
put
down
the
time
at
which
the
men
come
in
at
night
and
to
keep
all
discommonsed
tradesmen
stray
dogs
and
bad
characters
generally
out
of
the
college
the
large
quadrangle
into
which
you
come
first
is
bigger
than
ours
at
rugby
and
a
much
more
solemn
and
sleepy
sort
of
a
place
with
its
gables
and
old
mullioned
windows
one
side
is
occupied
by
the
hall
and
chapel
the
principal
house
takes
up
half
another
side
and
the
rest
is
divided
into
staircases
on
each
of
which
are
six
or
eight
sets
of
rooms
inhabited
by
us
undergraduates
and
here
and
there
a
tutor
or
fellow
dropped
down
amongst
us
in
the
rooms
of
course
not
exactly
to
keep
order
but
to
act
as
a
sort
of
ballast
this
quadrangle
is
the
show
part
of
the
college
and
is
generally
respectable
and
quiet
which
is
a
good
deal
more
than
can
be
said
for
the
inner
quadrangle
which
you
get
at
through
a
passage
leading
out
of
the
other
the
rooms
ai
half
so
large
or
good
in
the
inner
quad
and
here
where
all
we
freshmen
live
besides
a
lot
of
the
older
undergraduates
who
do
care
to
change
their
rooms
only
one
tutor
has
rooms
here
and
i
should
think
if
he
a
reading
man
it
wo
be
long
before
he
clears
out
for
all
sorts
of
high
jinks
go
on
on
the
and
the
row
on
the
staircases
is
often
as
bad
and
not
half
so
respectable
as
it
used
to
be
in
the
middle
passage
in
the
last
week
of
the
my
rooms
are
what
they
call
garrets
right
up
in
the
roof
with
a
commanding
view
of
the
college
tiles
and
chimney
pots
and
of
houses
at
the
back
no
end
of
cats
both
college
toms
and
strangers
haunt
the
neighbourhood
and
i
am
rapidly
learning
from
them
but
i
not
going
to
stand
it
i
want
to
know
the
college
toms
are
protected
by
the
statutes
i
believe
but
i
going
to
buy
an
for
the
benefit
of
the
strangers
my
rooms
are
pleasant
enough
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
staircase
and
separated
from
all
mankind
by
a
great
outer
door
my
oak
which
i
sport
when
i
go
out
or
want
to
be
quiet
sitting
room
eighteen
by
twelve
bedroom
twelve
by
eight
and
a
little
cupboard
for
the
scout
ah
geordie
the
scout
is
an
institution
fancy
me
waited
upon
and
valeted
by
a
stout
party
in
black
of
quiet
gentlemanly
manners
like
the
benevolent
father
in
a
comedy
he
takes
the
deepest
interest
in
all
my
possessions
and
proceedings
and
is
evidently
used
to
good
society
to
judge
by
the
amount
of
crockery
and
glass
wines
liquors
and
grocery
which
he
thinks
indispensable
for
my
due
establishment
he
has
also
been
good
enough
to
recommend
to
me
many
tradesmen
who
are
ready
to
supply
these
articles
in
any
quantities
each
of
whom
has
been
here
already
a
dozen
times
cap
in
hand
and
vowing
that
it
is
quite
immaterial
when
i
is
very
kind
of
them
but
with
the
highest
respect
for
friend
perkins
my
scout
and
his
obliging
friends
i
shall
make
some
enquiries
before
letting
in
with
any
of
them
he
waits
on
me
in
hall
where
we
go
in
full
fig
of
cap
and
gown
at
five
and
get
very
good
dinners
and
cheap
enough
it
is
rather
a
fine
old
room
with
a
good
arched
black
oak
ceiling
and
high
panelling
hung
round
with
pictures
of
old
swells
bishops
and
lords
chiefly
who
have
endowed
the
college
in
some
way
or
at
least
have
fed
here
in
times
gone
by
and
for
whom
caeterisque
benefactoribus
nostris
we
daily
give
thanks
in
a
long
latin
grace
which
one
of
the
undergraduates
i
think
it
must
be
goes
and
rattles
out
at
the
end
of
the
high
table
and
then
comes
down
again
from
the
dais
to
his
own
place
no
one
feeds
at
the
high
table
except
the
dons
and
the
who
are
undergraduates
in
velvet
caps
and
silk
gowns
why
they
wear
these
instead
of
cloth
and
serge
i
have
yet
made
out
i
believe
it
is
because
they
pay
double
fees
but
they
seem
uncommonly
wretched
up
at
the
high
table
and
i
should
think
would
sooner
pay
double
to
come
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
the
chapel
is
a
quaint
little
place
about
the
size
of
the
chancel
of
lutterworth
church
it
just
holds
us
all
comfortably
the
attendance
is
regular
enough
but
i
do
think
the
men
care
about
it
a
bit
in
general
several
i
can
see
bring
in
euclids
and
other
lecture
books
and
the
service
is
gone
through
at
a
great
pace
i
could
think
at
first
why
some
of
the
men
seemed
so
uncomfortable
and
stiff
about
the
legs
at
morning
service
but
i
find
that
they
are
the
hunting
set
and
come
in
with
over
their
pinks
and
trousers
over
their
leather
breeches
and
which
accounts
for
it
there
are
a
few
others
who
seem
very
devout
and
bow
a
good
deal
and
turn
towards
the
altar
at
different
parts
of
the
service
these
are
of
the
oxford
school
i
believe
but
i
shall
soon
find
out
more
about
them
on
the
whole
i
feel
less
at
home
at
present
i
am
sorry
to
say
in
the
chapel
than
anywhere
else
i
was
very
near
forgetting
a
great
institution
of
the
college
which
is
the
just
opposite
the
here
abides
the
fat
old
butler
all
the
servants
at
ambrose
are
portly
and
serves
out
limited
bread
butter
and
cheese
and
unlimited
beer
brewed
by
himself
for
an
hour
in
the
morning
at
noon
and
again
at
your
scout
always
fetches
you
a
pint
or
so
on
each
occasion
in
case
you
should
want
it
and
if
you
do
it
falls
to
him
but
i
ca
say
that
my
fellow
gets
much
for
i
am
naturally
a
thirsty
soul
and
can
not
often
resist
the
malt
myself
coming
up
as
it
does
fresh
and
cool
in
one
of
the
silver
tankards
of
which
we
seem
to
have
an
endless
supply
i
spent
a
day
or
two
in
the
first
week
before
i
got
shaken
down
into
my
place
here
in
going
round
and
seeing
the
other
colleges
and
finding
out
what
great
men
had
been
at
each
one
got
a
taste
for
that
sort
of
work
from
the
doctor
and
i
nothing
else
to
do
well
i
never
was
more
interested
fancy
ferreting
out
wycliffe
the
black
prince
our
friend
sir
walter
raleigh
pym
hampden
laud
ireton
butler
and
addison
in
one
afternoon
i
walked
about
two
inches
taller
in
my
trencher
cap
after
it
perhaps
i
may
be
going
to
make
dear
friends
with
some
fellow
who
will
change
the
history
of
england
why
should
i
there
must
have
been
freshmen
once
who
were
chums
of
wycliffe
of
queen
or
raleigh
of
oriel
i
mooned
up
and
down
the
staring
at
all
the
young
faces
in
caps
and
wondering
which
of
them
would
turn
out
great
generals
or
statesmen
or
poets
some
of
them
will
of
course
for
there
must
be
a
dozen
at
least
i
should
think
in
every
generation
of
undergraduates
who
will
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
the
ruling
and
guiding
of
the
british
nation
before
they
die
but
after
all
the
river
is
the
feature
of
oxford
to
my
mind
a
glorious
stream
not
five
minutes
walk
from
the
colleges
broad
enough
in
most
places
for
three
boats
to
row
abreast
i
expect
i
will
take
to
boating
furiously
i
have
been
down
the
river
three
or
four
times
already
with
some
other
freshmen
and
it
is
glorious
exercise
that
i
can
see
though
we
bungle
and
cut
crabs
desperately
at
present
here
a
long
yarn
i
spinning
for
you
and
i
dare
say
after
all
you
say
it
tells
you
nothing
and
you
rather
have
twenty
lines
about
the
men
and
what
they
thinking
about
and
the
meaning
and
the
inner
life
of
the
place
and
all
that
patience
patience
i
do
know
anything
about
it
myself
yet
and
have
had
only
time
to
look
at
the
shell
which
is
a
very
handsome
and
stately
affair
you
shall
have
the
kernel
if
i
ever
get
at
it
in
due
time
and
now
write
me
a
long
letter
directly
and
tell
me
about
the
doctor
and
who
are
in
the
sixth
and
how
the
house
goes
on
and
what
sort
of
an
eleven
there
be
and
what
you
are
doing
and
thinking
about
come
up
here
try
for
a
scholarship
i
take
you
in
and
show
you
the
lions
remember
me
to
old
ever
your
affectionately
t
b
chapter
ii
a
row
on
the
river
within
a
day
or
two
of
the
penning
of
this
celebrated
epistle
which
created
quite
a
sensation
in
the
room
as
it
went
the
round
after
tea
tom
realized
one
of
the
objects
of
his
young
oxford
ambition
and
succeeded
in
embarking
on
the
river
in
a
skiff
by
himself
with
such
results
as
are
now
described
he
had
already
been
down
several
times
in
and
boats
with
an
old
oar
to
pull
stroke
and
another
to
steer
and
coach
the
young
idea
but
he
was
not
satisfied
with
these
essays
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
such
a
bad
oar
as
the
old
made
him
out
to
be
and
thought
that
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
other
freshmen
who
were
learning
with
him
that
the
boat
made
so
little
way
and
rolled
so
much
he
had
been
such
a
proficient
in
all
the
rugby
games
that
he
could
realize
the
fact
of
his
unreadiness
in
a
boat
pulling
looked
a
simple
thing
enough
much
easier
than
tennis
and
he
had
made
a
capital
start
at
the
latter
game
and
been
highly
complimented
by
the
marker
after
his
first
hour
in
the
little
court
he
forgot
that
cricket
and
fives
are
capital
training
for
tennis
but
that
rowing
is
a
speciality
of
the
rudiments
of
which
he
was
wholly
ignorant
and
so
in
full
confidence
that
if
he
could
only
have
a
turn
or
two
alone
he
should
not
only
satisfy
himself
but
everybody
else
that
he
was
a
oar
he
refused
all
offers
of
companionship
and
started
on
the
afternoon
of
a
fine
february
day
down
to
the
boats
for
his
trial
trip
he
had
watched
his
regular
companions
well
out
of
college
and
gave
them
enough
start
to
make
sure
that
they
would
be
off
before
he
himself
could
arrive
at
dressing
room
at
hall
and
chuckled
as
he
came
within
sight
of
the
river
to
see
the
freshmen
boat
in
which
he
generally
performed
go
plunging
away
past
the
university
barge
keeping
three
different
times
with
four
oars
and
otherwise
demeaning
itself
so
as
to
become
an
object
of
mirthful
admiration
to
all
beholders
tom
was
punted
across
to
hall
in
a
state
of
great
content
which
increased
when
in
answer
to
his
casual
inquiry
the
managing
man
informed
him
that
not
a
man
of
his
college
was
about
the
place
so
he
ordered
a
skiff
with
as
much
dignity
and
coolness
as
he
could
command
and
hastened
up
stairs
to
dress
he
appeared
again
carrying
his
boating
coat
and
cap
they
were
quite
new
so
he
would
not
wear
them
nothing
about
him
should
betray
the
freshman
on
this
day
if
he
could
help
it
is
my
skiff
ready
all
right
sir
this
way
sir
said
the
manager
conducting
him
to
a
good
craft
any
gentleman
going
to
steer
sir
no
said
tom
superciliously
you
may
take
out
the
rudder
going
quite
alone
sir
better
take
one
of
our
boys
find
you
a
very
light
one
here
bill
and
he
turned
to
summons
a
juvenile
waterman
to
take
charge
of
our
hero
take
out
the
rudder
do
you
hear
interrupted
tom
i
have
a
steerer
well
sir
as
you
please
said
the
manager
proceeding
to
remove
the
degrading
appendage
the
river
rather
high
please
to
remember
sir
you
must
mind
the
mill
stream
at
iffley
lock
i
suppose
you
can
swim
yes
of
course
said
tom
settling
himself
on
his
cushion
now
shove
her
off
the
next
moment
he
was
well
out
in
the
stream
and
left
to
his
own
resources
he
got
his
sculls
out
successfully
enough
and
though
feeling
by
no
means
easy
on
his
seat
proceeded
to
pull
very
deliberately
past
the
barges
stopping
his
sculls
in
the
air
to
feather
accurately
in
the
hopes
of
deceiving
spectators
into
the
belief
that
he
was
an
old
hand
just
going
out
for
a
gentle
paddle
the
manager
watched
him
for
a
minute
and
turned
to
his
work
with
an
aspiration
that
he
might
not
come
to
grief
but
no
thought
of
grief
was
on
tom
mind
as
he
dropped
gently
down
impatient
for
the
time
when
he
should
pass
the
mouth
of
the
cherwell
and
so
having
no
longer
critical
eyes
to
fear
might
put
out
his
whole
strength
and
give
himself
at
least
if
not
the
world
assurance
of
a
waterman
the
day
was
a
very
fine
one
a
bright
sun
shining
and
a
nice
fresh
breeze
blowing
across
the
stream
but
not
enough
to
ruffle
the
water
seriously
some
heavy
storms
up
gloucestershire
way
had
cleared
the
air
and
swollen
the
stream
at
the
same
time
in
fact
the
river
was
as
full
as
it
could
be
without
overflowing
its
banks
a
state
in
which
of
all
others
it
is
the
least
safe
for
boating
experiments
fortunately
in
those
days
there
were
no
outriggers
even
the
racing
skiffs
were
comparatively
safe
craft
and
would
now
be
characterized
as
tubs
while
the
real
tubs
in
one
of
the
safest
of
which
the
prudent
manager
had
embarked
our
hero
were
of
such
build
that
it
required
considerable
ingenuity
actually
to
upset
them
if
any
ordinary
amount
of
bungling
could
have
done
it
voyage
would
have
terminated
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
cherwell
while
he
had
been
sitting
quiet
and
merely
paddling
and
almost
letting
the
stream
carry
him
down
the
boat
had
trimmed
well
enough
but
now
taking
a
long
breath
he
leaned
forward
and
dug
his
sculls
into
the
water
pulling
them
through
with
all
his
strength
the
consequence
of
this
feat
was
that
the
handles
of
the
sculls
came
into
violent
collision
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
were
barked
his
left
scull
unshipped
and
the
head
of
his
skiff
almost
blown
round
by
the
wind
before
he
could
restore
order
on
board
never
mind
try
again
thought
be
after
the
first
sensation
of
disgust
had
passed
off
and
a
glance
at
the
shore
showed
him
that
there
were
no
witnesses
of
course
i
forgot
one
hand
must
go
over
the
other
it
might
have
happened
to
anyone
let
me
see
which
hand
shall
i
keep
uppermost
the
left
that
the
weakest
and
away
he
went
again
keeping
his
fact
painfully
in
mind
and
so
avoiding
further
collision
amidships
for
four
or
five
strokes
but
as
in
other
sciences
the
giving
of
undue
prominence
to
one
fact
brings
others
inexorably
on
the
head
of
the
student
to
avenge
his
neglect
of
them
so
it
happened
with
tom
in
his
practical
study
of
the
science
of
rowing
that
by
thinking
of
his
hands
he
forgot
his
seat
and
the
necessity
of
trimming
properly
whereupon
the
old
tub
began
to
rock
fearfully
and
the
next
moment
he
missed
the
water
altogether
with
his
right
scull
and
subsided
backwards
not
without
struggles
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
while
the
half
stroke
which
he
had
pulled
with
his
left
hand
sent
her
head
well
into
the
bank
tom
picked
himself
up
and
settled
himself
on
his
bench
again
a
sadder
and
wiser
man
as
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
pulling
especially
sculling
does
not
like
reading
and
writing
come
by
nature
however
he
addressed
himself
manfully
to
his
task
savage
indeed
and
longing
to
drive
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
old
tub
but
as
resolved
as
ever
to
get
to
sandford
and
back
before
hall
time
or
perish
in
the
attempt
he
shoved
himself
off
the
bank
and
warned
by
his
last
mishap
got
out
into
mid
stream
and
there
moderating
his
ardor
and
contenting
himself
with
a
slow
and
steady
stroke
was
progressing
satisfactorily
and
beginning
to
recover
his
temper
when
a
loud
shout
startled
him
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
imminent
risk
of
an
upset
he
beheld
the
fast
sailor
the
dart
close
hauled
on
a
wind
and
almost
aboard
of
him
utterly
ignorant
of
what
was
the
right
thing
to
do
he
held
on
his
course
and
passed
close
under
the
bows
of
the
miniature
cutter
the
steersman
having
jammed
his
helm
hard
down
shaking
her
in
the
wind
to
prevent
running
over
the
skiff
and
solacing
himself
with
pouring
maledictions
on
tom
and
his
craft
in
which
the
man
who
had
hold
of
the
sheets
and
the
third
who
was
lounging
in
the
bows
heartily
joined
tom
was
out
of
before
he
had
collected
vituperation
enough
to
hurl
back
at
them
and
was
moreover
already
in
the
difficult
navigation
of
the
gut
where
notwithstanding
all
his
efforts
he
again
ran
aground
but
with
this
exception
he
arrived
without
other
mishap
at
iffley
where
he
lay
on
his
sculls
with
much
satisfaction
and
shouted
lock
lock
the
appeared
to
the
summons
but
instead
of
opening
the
gates
seized
a
long
and
rushed
towards
our
hero
calling
upon
him
to
mind
the
and
pull
his
scull
notwithstanding
which
warning
tom
was
within
an
ace
of
drifting
past
the
entrance
to
the
lock
in
which
case
assuredly
his
boat
if
not
he
had
never
returned
whole
however
the
managed
to
catch
the
stern
of
his
skiff
with
the
and
drag
him
back
into
the
proper
channel
and
then
opened
the
for
him
tom
congratulated
himself
as
he
entered
the
lock
that
there
were
no
other
boats
going
through
with
him
but
his
evil
star
was
in
the
ascendant
and
all
things
animate
and
inanimate
seemed
to
be
leagued
together
to
humiliate
him
as
the
water
began
to
fall
rapidly
he
lost
his
hold
of
the
chain
and
the
tub
instantly
drifted
across
the
lock
and
was
in
imminent
danger
of
sticking
and
breaking
her
back
when
the
again
came
to
the
rescue
with
his
and
guessing
the
state
of
the
case
did
not
quit
him
until
he
had
safely
shoved
him
and
his
boat
well
out
into
the
pool
below
with
an
exhortation
to
mind
and
go
outside
of
the
barge
which
was
coming
up
tom
started
on
the
latter
half
of
his
outward
voyage
with
the
sort
of
look
which
cato
must
have
worn
when
he
elected
the
losing
side
and
all
the
gods
went
over
to
the
winning
one
but
his
previous
struggles
had
not
been
thrown
away
and
he
managed
to
keep
the
right
side
of
the
barge
turn
the
corner
without
going
around
and
zigzag
down
kennington
reach
slowly
indeed
but
with
much
labor
but
at
any
rate
safely
rejoicing
in
his
feat
he
stopped
at
the
island
and
recreated
himself
with
a
glass
of
beer
looking
now
hopefully
towards
sandford
which
lay
within
easy
distance
now
upwards
again
along
the
reach
which
he
had
just
overcome
and
solacing
himself
with
the
remembrance
of
a
dictum
which
he
had
heard
from
a
great
authority
that
it
was
always
easier
to
steer
up
stream
than
down
from
which
he
argued
that
the
worst
part
of
his
trial
trip
was
now
over
presently
he
saw
a
skiff
turn
the
corner
at
the
top
of
the
kennington
reach
and
resolving
in
his
mind
to
get
to
sandford
before
the
new
comer
paid
for
his
beer
and
betook
himself
again
to
his
tub
he
got
pretty
well
off
and
the
island
shutting
out
his
unconscious
rival
from
his
view
worked
away
at
first
under
the
pleasing
delusion
that
he
was
holding
his
own
but
he
was
soon
undeceived
for
in
monstrously
short
time
the
pursuing
skiff
showed
around
the
corner
and
bore
down
on
him
he
never
relaxed
his
efforts
but
could
not
help
watching
the
enemy
as
he
came
up
with
him
hand
over
hand
and
envying
the
perfect
ease
with
which
he
seemed
to
be
pulling
his
long
steady
stroke
and
the
precision
with
which
he
steered
scarcely
ever
casting
a
look
over
his
shoulder
he
was
hugging
the
berkshire
side
himself
as
the
other
skiff
passed
him
and
thought
he
heard
the
sculler
say
something
about
keeping
out
and
minding
the
small
lasher
but
the
noise
of
the
waters
and
his
own
desperate
efforts
prevented
his
heeding
or
indeed
hearing
the
warning
plainly
in
another
minute
however
he
heard
plainly
enough
most
energetic
shouts
behind
him
and
turning
his
head
over
his
right
shoulder
saw
the
man
who
had
just
passed
him
backing
his
skiff
rapidly
up
stream
towards
him
the
next
moment
he
felt
the
bows
of
his
boat
whirl
round
the
old
tub
grounded
for
a
moment
and
then
turning
over
on
her
side
shot
him
out
on
to
the
planking
of
the
steep
descent
into
the
small
lasher
he
grasped
at
the
boards
but
they
were
too
slippery
to
hold
and
the
rush
of
water
was
too
strong
for
him
and
rolling
him
over
and
over
like
a
piece
of
driftwood
plunged
him
into
the
pool
below
after
the
first
moment
of
astonishment
and
fright
was
over
tom
left
himself
to
the
stream
holding
his
breath
hard
and
paddling
gently
with
his
hands
feeling
sure
that
if
he
could
only
hold
on
he
should
come
to
the
surface
sooner
or
later
which
accordingly
happened
after
a
somewhat
lengthy
submersion
his
first
impulse
on
rising
to
the
surface
after
catching
his
breath
was
to
strike
out
for
the
shore
but
in
the
act
of
doing
so
he
caught
sight
of
the
other
skiff
coming
stern
foremost
down
the
decent
after
him
and
he
trod
the
water
and
drew
in
his
breath
to
watch
down
she
came
as
straight
as
an
arrow
into
the
tumult
below
the
sculler
sitting
upright
and
holding
his
sculls
steadily
in
the
water
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
be
going
under
but
righted
herself
and
glided
swiftly
into
the
still
water
and
then
the
sculler
cast
a
hasty
and
anxious
glance
around
till
his
eyes
rested
on
our
hero
head
oh
there
you
are
he
said
looking
much
relieved
all
right
i
hope
not
hurt
eh
no
thankee
all
right
i
believe
answered
tom
what
shall
i
do
swim
ashore
i
look
after
your
boat
so
tom
took
the
advice
swam
ashore
and
there
stood
dripping
and
watching
the
other
as
he
righted
the
old
tub
which
was
floating
quietly
bottom
upwards
little
the
worse
for
the
mishap
and
no
doubt
if
boats
can
wish
earnestly
desiring
in
her
wooden
mind
to
be
allowed
to
go
quietly
to
pieces
then
and
there
sooner
to
be
rescued
than
be
again
entrusted
to
the
guidance
of
freshmen
the
tub
having
been
brought
to
the
bank
the
stranger
started
again
and
collected
the
sculls
and
bottom
boards
which
were
floating
about
here
and
there
in
the
pool
and
also
succeeded
in
making
salvage
of
tom
coat
the
pockets
of
which
held
his
watch
purse
and
cigar
case
these
he
brought
to
the
bank
and
delivering
them
over
inquired
whether
there
was
anything
else
to
look
after
thank
you
no
nothing
but
my
cap
never
mind
it
it
luck
enough
not
to
have
lost
the
coat
said
tom
holding
up
the
dripping
garment
to
let
the
water
run
out
of
the
arms
and
and
then
wringing
it
as
well
as
he
could
at
any
rate
thought
he
i
need
be
afraid
of
its
looking
too
new
any
more
the
stranger
put
off
again
and
made
one
more
round
searching
for
the
cap
and
anything
else
which
he
might
have
overlooked
but
without
success
while
he
was
doing
so
tom
had
time
to
look
him
well
over
and
see
what
sort
of
a
man
had
come
to
his
rescue
he
hardly
knew
at
the
time
the
full
extent
of
his
obligation
at
least
if
this
sort
of
obligation
is
to
be
reckoned
not
so
much
by
the
service
actually
rendered
as
by
the
risk
encountered
to
be
able
to
render
it
there
were
probably
not
three
men
in
the
university
who
would
have
dared
to
shoot
the
lasher
in
a
skiff
in
its
then
state
for
it
was
in
those
times
a
really
dangerous
place
and
tom
himself
had
an
extraordinary
escape
for
as
miller
the
ambrose
coxswain
remarked
on
hearing
the
story
no
one
who
was
born
to
be
hung
could
have
rolled
down
it
without
knocking
his
head
against
something
hard
and
going
down
like
lead
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
he
was
very
well
satisfied
with
his
inspection
the
other
man
was
evidently
a
year
or
two
older
than
himself
his
figure
was
more
set
and
he
had
stronger
whiskers
than
are
generally
grown
at
twenty
he
was
somewhere
about
five
feet
ten
in
height
very
and
with
long
powerful
arms
and
hands
there
was
no
denying
however
that
at
the
first
glance
he
was
an
ugly
man
he
was
marked
with
had
large
features
high
cheekbones
deeply
set
eyes
and
a
very
long
chin
and
had
got
the
trick
which
many
underhung
men
have
of
compressing
his
upper
lip
nevertheless
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
hit
tom
fancy
and
made
him
anxious
to
know
his
rescuer
better
he
had
an
instinct
that
good
was
to
be
gotten
out
of
him
so
he
was
very
glad
when
the
search
was
ended
and
the
stranger
came
to
the
bank
shipped
his
sculls
and
jumped
out
with
the
painter
of
his
skiff
in
his
hand
which
he
proceeded
to
fasten
to
an
old
stump
while
he
remarked
i
afraid
the
cap
lost
it
does
matter
the
least
thank
you
for
coming
to
help
me
it
was
very
kind
indeed
and
more
than
i
expected
do
they
say
that
one
oxford
man
will
never
save
another
from
drowning
unless
they
have
been
introduced
i
do
know
replied
the
other
are
you
sure
you
not
hurt
yes
quite
said
tom
foiled
in
what
he
considered
an
artful
plan
to
get
the
stranger
to
introduce
himself
then
we
very
well
out
of
it
said
the
other
looking
at
the
steep
descent
into
the
lasher
and
the
rolling
tumbling
rush
of
the
water
below
indeed
we
are
said
tom
but
how
in
the
world
did
you
manage
not
to
upset
i
hardly
know
myself
i
had
shipped
a
good
deal
of
water
you
see
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
jumped
out
on
the
bank
and
come
across
to
you
leaving
my
skiff
in
the
river
for
if
i
had
upset
i
could
have
helped
you
much
however
i
followed
my
instinct
which
was
to
come
the
quickest
way
i
thought
too
that
if
i
could
manage
to
get
down
in
the
boat
i
should
be
of
more
use
i
am
very
glad
i
did
it
he
added
after
a
moment
pause
really
proud
of
having
come
down
that
place
so
ai
i
said
tom
with
a
laugh
in
which
the
other
joined
but
now
you
getting
chilled
and
he
turned
from
the
lasher
and
looked
at
tom
chattering
jaws
oh
it
nothing
i
used
to
being
wet
but
you
may
just
as
well
be
comfortable
if
you
can
here
this
rough
jersey
which
i
use
instead
of
a
coat
pull
off
that
wet
cotton
affair
and
put
it
on
and
then
we
get
to
work
for
we
have
plenty
to
do
after
a
little
persuasion
tom
did
as
he
was
bid
and
got
into
the
great
woolen
garment
which
was
very
comforting
and
then
the
two
set
about
getting
their
skiffs
back
into
the
main
stream
this
was
comparatively
easy
as
to
the
lighter
skiff
which
was
soon
baled
out
and
hauled
by
main
force
on
to
the
bank
carried
across
and
launched
again
the
tub
gave
them
much
more
trouble
for
she
was
quite
full
of
water
and
very
heavy
but
after
twenty
minutes
or
so
of
hard
work
during
which
the
mutual
respect
of
the
labourers
for
the
strength
and
willingness
of
each
other
was
much
increased
she
also
lay
in
the
main
stream
leaking
considerably
but
otherwise
not
much
the
worse
for
her
adventure
now
what
do
you
mean
to
do
said
the
stranger
i
do
think
you
can
pull
home
in
her
one
does
know
how
much
she
may
be
damaged
she
may
sink
in
the
lock
or
play
any
prank
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
her
oh
you
can
leave
her
at
sandford
and
walk
up
and
send
one
of
hall
boys
after
her
or
if
you
like
i
will
tow
her
up
behind
my
skiff
wo
your
skiff
carry
two
yes
if
you
like
to
come
i
take
you
but
you
must
sit
very
quiet
ca
we
go
down
to
sandford
first
and
have
a
glass
of
ale
what
time
is
it
the
water
has
stopped
my
watch
a
quarter
past
three
i
have
about
twenty
minutes
to
spare
come
along
then
said
tom
but
will
you
let
me
pull
your
skiff
down
to
sandford
i
resolved
to
pull
to
sandford
and
do
like
to
give
it
up
by
all
means
if
you
like
said
the
other
with
a
smile
jump
in
and
i
walk
along
the
bank
thank
you
said
tom
hurrying
into
the
skiff
in
which
he
completed
the
remaining
quarter
of
a
mile
while
the
owner
walked
by
the
side
watching
him
they
met
on
the
bank
at
the
little
inn
by
sandford
lock
and
had
a
glass
of
ale
over
which
tom
confessed
that
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
navigated
a
skiff
by
himself
and
gave
a
detailed
account
of
his
adventures
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
companion
and
by
the
time
they
rose
to
go
it
was
settled
at
tom
earnest
request
that
he
should
pull
the
sound
skiff
up
while
his
companion
sat
in
the
stern
and
coached
him
the
other
consented
very
kindly
merely
stipulating
that
he
himself
should
take
the
sculls
if
it
should
prove
that
tom
could
not
pull
them
up
in
time
for
hall
dinner
so
they
started
and
took
the
tub
in
tow
when
they
came
up
to
it
tom
got
on
famously
under
his
new
tutor
who
taught
him
to
get
forward
and
open
his
knees
properly
and
throw
his
weight
on
to
the
sculls
at
the
beginning
of
the
stroke
he
managed
even
to
get
into
iffley
lock
on
the
way
up
without
fouling
the
gates
and
was
then
and
there
complimented
on
his
progress
whereupon
as
they
sat
while
the
lock
filled
tom
poured
out
his
thanks
to
his
tutor
for
his
instruction
which
had
been
given
so
judiciously
that
while
he
was
conscious
of
improving
at
every
stroke
he
did
not
feel
that
the
other
was
asserting
any
superiority
over
him
and
so
though
more
humble
than
at
the
most
disastrous
period
of
his
downward
voyage
he
was
getting
into
a
better
temper
every
minute
it
is
a
great
pity
that
some
of
our
instructors
in
more
important
matters
than
sculling
will
not
take
a
leaf
out
of
the
same
book
of
course
it
is
more
satisfactory
to
one
own
to
make
everyone
who
comes
to
one
to
learn
feel
that
he
is
a
fool
and
we
wise
men
but
if
our
object
is
to
teach
well
and
usefully
what
we
know
ourselves
there
can
not
be
a
worse
method
no
man
however
is
likely
to
adopt
it
so
long
as
he
is
conscious
that
he
has
anything
himself
to
learn
from
his
pupils
and
as
soon
as
he
has
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
they
can
teach
him
it
is
henceforth
to
be
all
give
and
no
sooner
he
throws
up
his
office
of
teacher
the
better
it
will
be
for
himself
his
pupils
and
his
country
whose
sons
he
is
misguiding
on
their
way
up
so
intent
were
they
on
their
own
work
that
it
was
not
until
shouts
of
hello
brown
how
did
you
get
there
why
you
said
you
were
not
going
down
today
greeted
them
just
above
the
gut
that
they
were
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
freshmen
of
ambrose
college
which
had
with
some
trouble
succeeded
in
overtaking
them
i
said
i
was
going
down
with
shouted
tom
grinding
away
harder
than
ever
that
they
might
witness
and
wonder
at
his
prowess
oh
i
dare
say
whose
skiff
are
you
towing
up
i
believe
been
upset
tom
made
no
reply
and
the
floundered
on
ahead
are
you
at
st
ambrose
asked
his
sitter
after
a
minute
yes
that
my
treadmill
that
i
been
down
in
it
almost
every
day
since
i
came
up
and
very
poor
fun
it
is
so
i
thought
i
would
go
on
my
own
hook
and
see
if
i
make
a
better
hand
of
it
and
i
have
too
i
know
thanks
to
you
the
other
made
no
remark
but
a
little
shade
came
over
his
face
he
had
no
chance
of
making
out
tom
college
as
the
new
cap
which
would
have
betrayed
him
had
disappeared
in
the
lasher
he
himself
wore
a
glazed
straw
hat
which
was
of
no
college
so
that
up
to
this
time
neither
of
them
had
known
to
what
college
the
other
belonged
when
they
landed
at
hall
tom
was
at
once
involved
in
a
wrangle
with
the
manager
as
to
the
amount
of
damage
done
to
the
tub
which
the
latter
refused
to
assess
before
he
knew
what
had
happened
to
it
while
our
hero
vigorously
and
with
reason
maintained
that
if
he
knew
his
business
it
could
not
matter
what
had
happened
to
the
boat
there
she
was
and
he
must
say
whether
she
was
better
or
worse
or
how
much
worse
than
when
she
started
in
the
middle
of
which
dialogue
his
new
acquaintance
touching
his
arm
said
you
can
leave
my
jersey
with
your
own
things
i
shall
get
it
and
then
disappeared
tom
when
he
had
come
to
terms
with
his
adversary
ran
upstairs
expecting
to
find
the
other
and
meaning
to
tell
his
name
and
find
out
who
it
was
that
had
played
the
good
samaritan
by
him
he
was
much
annoyed
when
he
found
the
coast
clear
and
dressed
in
a
grumbling
humour
i
wonder
why
he
should
have
gone
off
so
quick
he
might
just
as
well
have
stayed
and
walked
up
with
me
thought
he
let
me
see
though
did
he
say
i
was
to
leave
his
jersey
in
our
room
with
my
own
things
why
perhaps
he
is
a
ambrose
man
himself
but
then
he
would
have
told
me
so
surely
i
remember
to
have
seen
his
face
in
chapel
or
hall
but
then
there
is
such
a
lot
of
new
faces
and
he
may
not
sit
near
me
however
i
mean
to
find
him
out
before
long
whoever
he
may
be
with
which
resolve
tom
crossed
in
the
punt
into
christ
church
meadow
and
strolled
feeling
that
he
had
had
a
good
hard
afternoon
exercise
and
was
much
the
better
for
it
he
might
have
satisfied
his
curiosity
at
once
by
simply
asking
the
manager
who
it
was
that
had
arrived
with
him
and
this
occurred
to
him
before
he
got
home
whereat
he
felt
satisfied
but
would
not
go
back
then
as
it
was
so
near
hall
time
he
would
be
sure
to
remember
it
the
first
thing
tomorrow
as
it
happened
however
he
had
not
so
long
to
wait
for
the
information
which
he
needed
for
scarcely
had
he
sat
down
in
hall
and
ordered
his
dinner
when
he
caught
sight
of
his
boating
acquaintance
who
walked
in
habited
in
a
gown
which
tom
took
for
a
scholar
he
took
his
seat
at
a
little
table
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
near
the
bachelors
table
but
quite
away
from
the
rest
of
the
undergraduates
at
which
sat
four
or
five
other
men
in
similar
gowns
he
either
did
not
or
would
not
notice
the
looks
of
recognition
which
tom
kept
firing
at
him
until
he
had
taken
his
seat
who
is
that
man
that
has
just
come
in
do
you
know
said
tom
to
his
next
neighbour
a
second
term
man
which
said
the
other
looking
up
that
one
over
at
the
little
table
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
with
the
dark
whiskers
there
he
has
just
turned
rather
from
us
and
put
his
arm
on
the
table
oh
his
name
is
hardy
do
you
know
him
no
i
do
think
anybody
does
they
say
he
is
a
clever
fellow
but
a
very
queer
one
why
does
he
sit
at
that
table
he
is
one
of
our
servitors
they
all
sit
there
together
oh
said
tom
not
much
wiser
for
the
information
but
resolved
to
waylay
hardy
as
soon
as
the
hall
was
over
and
highly
delighted
to
find
that
they
were
after
all
of
the
same
college
for
he
had
already
begun
to
find
out
that
however
friendly
you
may
be
with
men
you
must
live
chiefly
with
those
of
your
own
but
now
his
scout
brought
his
dinner
and
he
fell
to
with
the
appetite
of
a
freshman
on
his
ample
commons
chapter
iii
a
breakfast
at
no
man
in
ambrose
college
gave
such
breakfasts
as
drysdale
not
the
great
heavy
spreads
for
thirty
or
forty
which
came
once
or
twice
a
term
when
everything
was
supplied
out
of
the
college
kitchen
and
you
had
to
ask
leave
of
the
dean
before
you
could
have
it
at
all
in
those
ponderous
feasts
the
most
of
the
undergraduate
kind
might
rival
the
most
artistic
if
he
could
only
pay
his
or
get
credit
with
the
cook
but
the
daily
morning
meal
when
even
gentlemen
commoners
were
limited
to
two
hot
dishes
out
of
the
kitchen
this
was
drysdale
forte
ordinary
men
left
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
scouts
and
were
content
with
the
buttered
toasts
and
eggs
with
a
dish
of
broiled
ham
or
something
of
the
sort
with
a
marmalade
and
bitter
ale
to
finish
with
but
drysdale
was
not
an
ordinary
man
as
you
felt
in
a
moment
when
you
went
to
breakfast
with
him
for
the
first
time
the
staircase
on
which
he
lived
was
inhabited
except
in
the
garrets
by
men
in
the
fast
set
and
he
and
three
others
who
had
an
equal
aversion
to
solitary
feeding
had
established
a
in
which
thanks
to
drysdale
genius
real
scientific
gastronomy
was
cultivated
every
morning
the
boy
from
the
weirs
arrived
with
freshly
caught
gudgeon
and
now
and
then
an
eel
or
trout
which
the
scouts
on
the
staircase
had
learnt
to
fry
delicately
in
oil
fresh
watercresses
came
in
the
same
basket
and
the
college
kitchen
furnished
a
spitchedcocked
chicken
or
grilled
turkey
leg
in
the
season
there
were
plover
eggs
or
at
the
worst
there
was
a
dainty
omelette
and
a
distant
baker
famed
for
his
light
rolls
and
high
charges
sent
in
the
bread
the
common
domestic
college
loaf
being
of
course
out
of
the
question
for
anyone
with
the
slightest
pretension
to
taste
and
fit
only
for
the
perquisite
of
scouts
then
there
would
be
a
deep
yorkshire
pie
or
reservoir
of
potted
game
as
a
de
and
three
or
four
sorts
of
preserves
and
a
large
cool
tankard
of
cider
or
to
finish
up
with
or
and
maraschino
for
a
change
tea
and
coffee
were
there
indeed
but
merely
as
a
compliment
to
those
respectable
beverages
for
they
were
rarely
touched
by
the
breakfast
eaters
of
no
staircase
pleasant
young
gentlemen
they
were
on
no
staircase
i
mean
the
ground
and
first
floor
men
who
formed
the
for
the
garrets
were
nobodies
three
out
of
the
four
were
with
allowances
of
a
year
at
least
each
and
as
they
treated
their
allowances
as
and
were
all
in
their
first
year
ready
money
was
plenty
and
credit
good
and
they
might
have
had
potted
hippopotamus
for
breakfast
if
they
had
chosen
to
order
it
which
they
would
most
likely
have
done
if
they
had
thought
of
it
two
out
of
the
three
were
the
sons
of
rich
men
who
made
their
own
fortunes
and
sent
their
sons
to
ambrose
because
it
was
very
desirable
that
the
young
gentlemen
should
make
good
connexions
in
fact
the
fathers
looked
upon
the
university
as
a
good
investment
and
gloried
much
in
hearing
their
sons
talk
familiarly
in
the
vacations
of
their
dear
friends
lord
harry
this
and
sir
george
that
drysdale
the
third
of
the
set
was
the
heir
of
an
old
as
well
of
a
rich
family
and
consequently
having
his
connexion
ready
made
to
his
hand
cared
little
enough
with
whom
he
associated
provided
they
were
pleasant
fellows
and
gave
him
good
food
and
wines
his
whole
idea
at
present
was
to
enjoy
himself
as
much
as
possible
but
he
had
good
manly
stuff
in
him
at
the
bottom
and
had
he
fallen
into
any
but
the
fast
set
would
have
made
a
fine
fellow
and
done
credit
to
himself
and
his
college
the
fourth
man
at
the
the
hon
piers
st
cloud
was
in
his
third
year
and
was
a
very
young
man
his
allowance
was
small
for
the
set
he
lived
with
but
he
never
wanted
for
anything
he
did
entertain
much
certainly
but
when
he
did
everything
was
in
the
best
possible
style
he
was
very
exclusive
and
knew
no
man
in
college
out
of
the
fast
set
and
of
these
he
addicted
himself
chiefly
to
the
society
of
the
rich
freshmen
for
somehow
the
men
of
his
own
standing
seemed
a
little
shy
of
him
but
with
the
freshmen
he
was
always
hand
and
glove
lived
in
their
rooms
and
used
their
wines
horses
and
other
movable
property
as
his
own
being
a
good
whist
and
billiard
player
and
not
a
bad
jockey
he
managed
in
one
way
or
another
to
make
his
young
friends
pay
well
for
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
as
indeed
why
should
they
not
at
least
those
of
them
who
came
to
the
college
to
form
eligible
connexions
for
had
not
his
remote
lineal
ancestor
come
over
in
the
same
ship
with
william
the
conqueror
were
not
all
his
relations
about
the
court
as
lords
and
ladies
in
waiting
white
sticks
or
black
rods
and
in
the
innermost
of
all
possible
circles
of
the
great
world
and
was
there
a
better
coat
of
arms
than
he
bore
in
all
burke
peerage
our
hero
had
met
drysdale
at
a
house
in
the
country
shortly
before
the
beginning
of
his
first
term
and
they
had
rather
taken
to
one
another
drysdale
had
been
amongst
his
first
callers
and
as
he
came
out
of
chapel
one
morning
shortly
after
his
arrival
drysdale
scout
came
up
to
him
with
an
invitation
to
breakfast
so
he
went
to
his
own
rooms
ordered
his
commons
to
be
taken
across
to
no
and
followed
himself
a
few
minutes
afterwards
no
one
was
in
the
rooms
when
he
arrived
for
none
of
the
club
had
finished
their
toilettes
morning
chapel
was
not
meant
for
or
cultivated
by
they
paid
double
chapel
fees
in
consideration
of
which
probably
they
were
not
expected
to
attend
so
often
as
the
rest
of
the
undergraduates
at
any
rate
they
did
and
no
harm
came
to
them
in
consequence
of
their
absence
as
tom
entered
a
great
splashing
in
an
inner
room
stopped
for
a
moment
and
drysdale
voice
shouted
out
that
he
was
in
his
tub
but
would
be
with
him
in
a
minute
so
tom
gave
himself
up
to
contemplation
of
the
rooms
in
which
his
fortunate
acquaintance
dwelt
and
very
pleasant
rooms
they
were
the
large
room
in
which
the
was
laid
for
five
was
lofty
and
well
proportioned
and
panelled
with
old
oak
and
the
furniture
was
handsome
and
solid
and
in
keeping
with
the
room
there
were
four
deep
windows
high
up
in
the
wall
with
cushioned
seats
under
them
two
looking
into
the
large
quadrangle
and
two
into
the
inner
one
outside
these
windows
drysdale
had
rigged
up
hanging
gardens
which
were
kept
full
of
flowers
by
the
first
nurseryman
in
oxford
all
the
year
round
so
that
even
on
this
february
morning
the
scent
of
gardenia
and
violets
pervaded
the
room
and
strove
for
mastery
with
the
smell
of
stale
tobacco
which
hung
about
the
curtains
and
sofa
there
was
a
large
glass
in
an
oak
frame
over
the
mantelpiece
which
was
loaded
with
choice
pipes
and
cigar
cases
and
quaint
receptacles
for
tobacco
and
by
the
side
of
the
glass
hung
small
carved
oak
frames
containing
lists
of
meets
of
the
heyshrop
the
old
berkshire
and
drake
hounds
for
the
current
week
there
was
a
queer
assortment
of
paintings
and
engravings
on
the
walls
some
of
considerable
merit
especially
some
watercolor
and
and
engravings
from
pictures
mingled
with
which
hung
taglioni
and
cerito
in
short
petticoats
and
impossible
attitudes
phosphurous
winning
the
derby
the
death
of
grimaldi
the
famous
horse
not
poor
old
joe
an
american
trotting
match
and
jem
belcher
and
deaf
burke
in
attitudes
of
several
tandem
and
riding
whips
mounted
in
heavy
silver
and
a
gun
and
fishing
rods
occupied
one
corner
and
a
polished
copper
cask
holding
about
five
gallons
of
mild
ale
stood
in
another
in
short
there
was
plenty
of
everything
except
books
the
literature
of
the
world
being
represented
so
far
as
tom
could
make
out
in
his
short
scrutiny
by
a
few
but
badly
used
volumes
of
the
classics
with
the
cribs
thereto
appertaining
shoved
away
into
a
cupboard
which
stood
half
open
and
contained
besides
decanters
and
large
pewters
and
dog
collars
and
packs
of
cards
and
all
sorts
of
miscellaneous
articles
to
serve
as
an
antidote
tom
had
scarcely
finished
his
short
survey
when
the
door
of
the
bedroom
opened
and
drysdale
emerged
in
a
loose
jacket
lined
with
silk
his
velvet
cap
on
his
head
and
otherwise
gorgeously
attired
he
was
a
fellow
of
middle
size
with
dark
hair
and
a
merry
brown
eye
with
a
twinkle
in
it
which
spoke
well
for
his
sense
of
humor
otherwise
his
large
features
were
rather
plain
but
he
had
the
look
and
manners
of
a
thoroughly
gentleman
his
first
act
after
nodding
to
tom
was
to
seize
on
a
pewter
and
resort
to
the
cask
in
the
corner
from
whence
he
drew
a
pint
or
so
of
the
contents
having
as
he
said
whoreson
longing
for
that
poor
creature
small
beer
we
were
playing
in
blake
rooms
till
three
last
night
and
he
gave
us
devilled
bones
and
mulled
port
a
fellow
ca
enjoy
his
breakfast
after
that
without
something
to
cool
his
coppers
tom
was
as
yet
ignorant
of
what
might
be
so
held
his
peace
and
took
a
pull
at
the
beer
which
the
other
handed
to
him
and
then
the
scout
entered
and
received
orders
to
bring
up
jack
and
the
breakfast
and
not
wait
for
any
one
in
another
minute
a
bouncing
and
scratching
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
a
white
bulldog
rushed
in
a
gem
in
his
way
for
his
brow
was
broad
and
massive
his
skin
was
as
fine
as
a
lady
and
his
tail
taper
and
nearly
as
thin
as
a
clay
pipe
his
general
look
and
a
way
he
had
of
going
about
the
calves
of
strangers
were
not
pleasant
for
nervous
people
tom
however
was
used
to
dogs
and
soon
became
friends
with
him
which
evidently
pleased
his
host
and
then
the
breakfast
arrived
all
smoking
and
with
it
the
two
other
ingenious
youths
in
velvet
caps
and
far
more
gorgeous
apparel
so
far
as
colors
went
than
drysdale
they
were
introduced
to
tom
who
thought
them
somewhat
ordinary
and
rather
loud
young
gentlemen
one
of
them
remonstrated
vigorously
against
the
presence
of
that
confounded
dog
and
so
jack
was
sent
to
lie
down
in
a
corner
and
then
the
four
fell
to
work
upon
the
breakfast
it
was
a
good
lesson
in
gastronomy
but
the
results
are
scarcely
worth
repeating
here
it
is
wonderful
though
how
you
feel
drawn
to
a
man
who
feeds
you
well
and
as
tom
appetite
got
less
his
liking
and
respect
for
his
host
undoubtedly
increased
when
they
had
nearly
finished
in
walked
the
honorable
piers
a
tall
slight
man
two
or
three
years
older
than
the
rest
of
them
good
looking
and
very
well
and
quietly
dressed
but
with
the
drawing
up
of
his
nostril
and
a
drawing
down
of
the
corners
of
his
mouth
which
set
tom
against
him
at
once
the
cool
supercilious
moreover
to
which
he
treated
our
hero
when
introduced
to
him
was
enough
to
spoil
his
digestion
and
hurt
his
a
good
deal
more
than
he
would
have
liked
to
own
here
henry
said
the
honorable
piers
to
the
scout
in
attendance
seating
himself
and
inspecting
the
dishes
what
is
there
for
my
breakfast
henry
bustled
about
and
handed
a
dish
or
two
i
do
want
these
cold
things
have
you
kept
me
any
gudgeon
why
sir
said
henry
there
was
only
two
dozen
this
morning
and
drysdale
told
me
to
cook
them
all
to
be
sure
i
did
said
drysdale
just
half
a
dozen
for
each
of
us
four
they
were
if
you
ca
get
here
at
nine
you
wo
get
gudgeon
i
can
tell
you
just
go
and
get
me
a
broil
from
the
kitchen
said
the
honorable
piers
without
deigning
an
answer
to
drysdale
very
sorry
sir
kitchen
shut
by
now
sir
answered
henry
then
go
to
hinton
and
order
some
cutlets
i
say
henry
shouted
drysdale
to
the
retreating
scout
not
to
my
tick
mind
put
them
down
to
st
cloud
henry
seemed
to
know
very
well
that
in
that
case
he
might
save
himself
the
trouble
of
the
journey
and
consequently
returned
to
his
waiting
and
the
honorable
piers
set
to
work
upon
his
breakfast
without
showing
any
further
ill
temper
certainly
except
by
the
stinging
things
which
he
threw
every
now
and
then
into
the
conversation
for
the
benefit
of
each
of
the
others
in
turn
tom
thought
he
detected
signs
of
coming
hostilities
between
his
host
and
st
cloud
for
drysdale
seemed
to
prick
up
his
ears
and
get
combative
whenever
the
other
spoke
and
lost
no
chance
in
roughing
him
in
his
replies
and
indeed
he
was
not
far
wrong
the
fact
being
that
during
drysdale
first
term
the
other
had
lived
on
his
wine
smoking
his
cigars
driving
his
and
winning
his
money
all
which
drysdale
who
was
the
easiest
going
and
best
tempered
fellow
in
oxford
had
stood
without
turning
a
hair
but
st
cloud
added
to
these
little
favors
a
half
patronizing
half
contemptuous
manner
which
he
used
with
great
success
towards
some
of
the
other
who
thought
it
a
mark
of
high
breeding
and
the
correct
thing
but
which
drysdale
who
did
care
three
straws
about
knowing
st
cloud
was
going
to
put
up
with
however
nothing
happened
but
a
little
sparring
and
the
breakfast
things
were
cleared
away
and
the
tankards
left
on
the
table
and
the
company
betook
themselves
to
cigars
and
easy
chairs
jack
came
out
of
his
corner
to
be
gratified
with
some
of
the
remnants
by
his
fond
master
and
then
curled
himself
up
on
the
sofa
along
which
drysdale
lounged
what
are
you
going
to
do
drysdale
said
one
of
the
others
i
ordered
a
leader
to
be
sent
on
over
the
bridge
and
mean
to
drive
my
over
and
dine
at
abingdon
wo
you
come
who
going
besides
asked
drysdale
oh
only
st
cloud
and
farley
here
there
lots
of
room
for
a
fourth
no
teaming
slow
work
on
the
back
seat
besides
i
half
promised
to
go
down
in
the
boat
in
the
boat
shouted
the
other
why
you
do
mean
to
say
you
going
to
take
to
pulling
well
i
do
know
i
rather
think
i
am
i
of
driving
and
doing
the
high
street
and
playing
cards
and
billiards
all
day
and
our
boat
is
likely
to
be
head
of
the
river
i
think
by
jove
i
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
you
taking
to
reading
or
going
to
university
sermon
put
in
st
cloud
and
the
too
went
on
farley
did
you
ever
see
such
a
set
st
cloud
with
their
everlasting
flannels
and
jerseys
and
hair
cropped
like
i
bet
a
guinea
there
is
one
of
them
has
more
than
a
year
put
in

whose
father
could
just
write
his

making
a
colossal
fortune

supplying
bad
iron
rails

the
new
railway
companies

the

care

i
know
they
a
deal
more
amusing
than
you
fellows
who
ca
do
anything
that
do
cost
pounds
getting
economical
sneered
st
cloud
well
i
do
see
the
fun
of
tearing
one
heart
out
and
blistering
one
hands
only
to
get
abused
by
that
little
brute
miller
the
coxswain
said
farley
why
you
wo
be
able
to
sit
straight
in
your
chair
for
a
month
said
chanter
and
the
captain
will
make
you
dine
at
one
and
fetch
you
out
of
anybody
rooms
confound
his
impudence
whether
he
knows
them
or
not
at
eleven
every
night
two
cigars
every
day
and
a
pint
and
a
half
of
liquid
and
farley
inserted
his
cod
fish
face
into
the
tankard
fancy
drysdale
on
training
allowance
here
a
newcomer
entered
in
a
bachelor
gown
who
was
warmly
greeted
by
the
name
of
sanders
by
drysdale
st
cloud
and
he
exchanged
the
coldest
possible
nods
and
the
other
two
taking
the
office
from
their
mentor
stared
at
him
through
their
smoke
and
after
a
minute
or
two
silence
and
a
few
rude
remarks
amongst
themselves
went
off
to
play
a
game
of
pyramids
till
luncheon
time
saunders
took
a
cigar
which
drysdale
offered
and
began
asking
about
his
friends
at
home
and
what
he
had
been
doing
in
the
vacation
they
were
evidently
intimate
though
tom
thought
that
drysdale
did
seem
quite
at
his
ease
at
first
which
he
wondered
at
as
sanders
took
his
fancy
at
once
however
eleven
struck
and
tom
had
to
go
to
lecture
where
we
can
not
follow
him
just
now
but
must
remain
with
drysdale
and
saunders
who
chatted
on
very
pleasantly
for
some
twenty
minutes
till
a
knock
came
at
the
door
it
was
not
till
the
third
summons
that
drysdale
shouted
come
in
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
an
impatient
kick
at
the
sofa
cushion
at
his
feet
as
though
not
half
pleased
at
the
approaching
visit
reader
had
you
not
ever
a
friend
a
few
years
older
than
yourself
whose
good
opinions
you
were
anxious
to
keep
a
fellow
atqua
who
could
do
everything
better
than
you
from
plato
and
tennis
down
to
singing
a
comic
song
and
playing
quoits
if
you
have
had
was
he
always
in
your
rooms
or
company
whenever
anything
happened
to
show
your
little
weak
points
sanders
at
any
rate
occupied
this
position
towards
our
young
friend
drysdale
and
the
latter
much
as
he
liked
company
would
have
preferred
it
at
any
time
than
on
an
idle
morning
just
at
the
beginning
of
term
when
the
gentlemen
tradesmen
who
look
upon
undergraduates
in
general
and
in
particular
as
their
lawful
prey
are
in
the
habit
of
calling
in
flocks
the
new
arrival
was
a
tall
florid
man
with
a
half
servile
half
impudent
manner
and
a
foreign
accent
dressed
in
sumptuous
costume
with
a
coat
and
a
gorgeous
plush
under
his
arm
he
carried
a
large
parcel
which
he
proceeded
to
open
and
placed
upon
a
sofa
the
contents
consisting
of
a
couple
of
coats
and
three
or
four
waistcoats
and
a
pair
of
trousers
he
saluted
sanders
with
a
most
obsequious
bow
looked
nervously
at
jack
who
opened
one
eye
from
between
his
master
legs
and
growled
and
then
turning
to
drysdale
asked
if
he
should
have
the
honor
of
seeing
him
try
on
any
of
the
clothes
no
i
ca
be
bored
with
trying
them
on
now
said
drysdale
leave
them
where
they
are
schloss
would
like
very
much
on
his
return
to
town
in
a
day
or
two
to
be
able
to
assure
his
principals
that
orders
had
been
executed
to
his
satisfaction
he
had
also
some
very
beautiful
new
stuffs
with
him
which
he
should
like
to
submit
to
drysdale
and
without
more
ado
began
unfolding
cards
of
the
most
fabulous
plushes
and
cloths
drysdale
glanced
first
at
the
cards
and
then
at
sanders
who
sat
puffing
his
cigar
and
watching
schloss
proceedings
with
a
look
not
unlike
jack
when
anyone
he
did
not
approve
of
approached
his
master
confound
your
patterns
schloss
said
drysdale
i
tell
you
i
have
more
things
than
i
want
already
the
large
stripe
such
as
these
is
now
very
much
worn
in
london
went
on
schloss
without
heeding
the
rebuff
and
spreading
his
cards
on
the
table
replied
drysdale
you
seem
to
think
a
fellow
has
ten
pair
of
legs
monsieur
is
pleased
to
joke
smiled
schloss
but
to
be
in
the
mode
gentlemen
must
have
variety
well
i
wo
order
any
now
that
flat
said
drysdale
monsieur
will
do
as
he
pleases
but
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
not
have
some
plush
waists
the
fabric
is
only
just
out
and
is
making
a
sensation
now
look
here
schloss
will
you
go
if
i
order
a
waist
coat
monsieur
is
very
good
he
sees
how
tasteful
these
new
patterns
are
i
would
be
seen
at
a
in
one
of
them
there
as
gaudy
as
a
said
drysdale
feeling
the
stuff
which
the
obsequious
schloss
held
out
but
it
seems
nice
stuff
too
he
went
on
i
should
mind
having
a
couple
of
waistcoats
of
it
of
this
pattern
and
he
chucked
across
to
schloss
a
dark
tartan
waistcoat
which
was
lying
near
him
have
you
got
the
stuff
in
that
pattern
ah
no
said
schloss
gathering
up
the
waistcoat
but
it
shall
not
hinder
i
shall
have
at
once
a
loom
for
monsieur
set
up
at
once
in
paris
set
it
up
in
jericho
if
you
like
said
drysdale
and
now
go
may
i
ask
schloss
broke
in
sanders
what
it
will
cost
to
set
up
the
loom
ah
indeed
a
trifle
only
some
twelve
or
perhaps
fourteen
pounds
sanders
gave
a
chuckle
and
puffed
away
at
his
cigar
by
jove
shouted
drysdale
jerking
himself
in
a
sitting
posture
and
upsetting
jack
who
went
trotting
about
the
room
and
snuffing
at
schloss
legs
do
you
mean
to
say
schloss
you
were
going
to
make
me
waistcoats
at
fourteen
guineas
apiece
not
if
monsieur
disapproves
ah
the
large
hound
is
not
friendly
to
strangers
i
will
call
again
when
monsieur
is
more
at
leisure
and
schloss
gathered
up
his
cards
and
beat
a
hasty
retreat
followed
by
jack
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
casting
an
enraged
look
at
sanders
as
he
slid
through
the
door
well
done
jack
old
boy
said
sanders
patting
him
what
a
funk
the
fellow
was
in
well
you
saved
your
master
a
pony
this
fine
morning
cheap
dog
you
got
drysdale
d
the
fellow
answered
drysdale
he
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
one
mouth
and
he
went
to
the
table
took
a
pull
at
the
tankard
and
then
threw
himself
down
on
the
sofa
again
as
jack
jumped
up
and
coiled
himself
round
by
his
master
legs
keeping
one
eye
winking
at
him
and
giving
an
occasional
wag
with
the
end
of
his
taper
tail
saunders
got
up
and
began
handling
the
new
things
first
he
held
up
a
pair
of
bright
blue
trousers
with
a
red
stripe
across
them
drysdale
looking
on
from
the
sofa
i
say
drysdale
you
mean
to
say
you
really
ordered
these
affairs
heaven
only
knows
said
drysdale
i
daresay
i
did
i
order
a
full
suit
cut
out
of
my
grandmother
farthingale
to
get
that
cursed
schloss
out
of
my
rooms
sometimes
you
never
be
able
to
wear
them
even
in
oxford
the
boys
would
mob
you
why
do
you
kick
him
down
stairs
suggested
sanders
putting
down
the
trousers
and
turning
to
drysdale
well
i
been
very
near
it
once
or
twice
but
i
do
know
my
name
easy
besides
i
do
want
to
give
up
the
beast
altogether
he
makes
the
best
trousers
in
england
and
these
waistcoats
went
on
sanders
let
me
see
three
light
silk
waistcoats
and
lavender
well
of
course
you
can
only
wear
these
at
your
weddings
you
may
be
married
the
first
time
in
the
peach
or
and
then
if
you
have
luck
and
bury
your
first
wife
soon
it
will
be
a
delicate
compliment
to
take
to
in
the
lavender
that
being
but
still
you
see
we
in
difficulty
as
to
one
of
the
three
either
the
peach
or
the
here
he
was
interrupted
by
another
knock
and
a
boy
entered
from
the
fashionable
tobacconist
in
oriel
lane
who
had
general
orders
to
let
drysdale
have
his
fair
share
of
anything
very
special
in
the
cigar
line
he
deposited
a
two
pound
box
of
cigars
at
three
guineas
the
pound
on
the
table
and
withdrew
in
silence
then
came
a
with
a
new
pair
of
which
drysdale
had
ordered
in
november
and
had
forgotten
next
day
the
artist
wisely
considering
that
his
young
patron
must
have
plenty
of
tops
to
last
him
through
the
hunting
season
he
himself
having
supplied
three
previous
pairs
in
october
had
retained
the
present
pair
for
show
in
his
window
and
everyone
knows
that
boots
wear
much
better
for
being
kept
sometime
before
use
now
however
as
the
hunting
season
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
place
in
the
window
was
wanted
for
spring
stock
he
judiciously
sent
in
the
tops
merely
adding
or
so
to
the
price
for
interest
on
the
out
lay
since
the
order
he
also
kindly
left
on
the
table
a
pair
of
large
plated
spurs
to
match
the
boots
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
sanders
sat
smoking
his
cigar
in
provoking
silence
while
knock
succeeded
knock
and
tradesman
followed
tradesman
each
depositing
some
article
ordered
or
supposed
to
have
been
ordered
or
which
ought
in
the
judgment
of
the
depositors
to
have
been
ordered
by
the
luckless
drysdale
and
new
hats
and
ties
and
gloves
and
pins
jostled
balsam
of
neroli
and
registered
and
fancy
letter
paper
and
eau
de
cologne
on
every
available
table
a
visit
from
two
in
succession
followed
each
of
whom
had
several
new
leaders
which
they
were
anxious
drysdale
should
try
as
soon
as
possible
drysdale
growled
and
grunted
and
wished
them
or
sanders
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
however
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
the
worst
was
now
passed
there
was
no
other
possible
supplier
of
undergraduate
wants
who
could
arrive
not
so
in
another
minute
a
gentle
knock
came
at
the
door
jack
pricked
up
his
ears
and
wagged
his
tail
drysdale
recklessly
shouted
come
in
the
door
slowly
opened
about
eighteen
inches
and
a
shock
head
of
hair
entered
the
room
from
which
one
lively
little
gimlet
eye
went
glancing
about
into
every
corner
the
other
eye
was
closed
but
as
a
perpetual
wink
to
indicate
the
unsleeping
wariness
of
the
owner
or
because
that
hero
had
really
lost
the
power
of
using
it
in
some
of
his
numerous
encounters
with
men
and
beasts
no
one
so
far
as
i
know
has
ever
ascertained
ah
drysdale
sir
began
the
head
and
then
rapidly
withdrew
behind
the
door
to
avoid
one
of
the
spurs
which
being
the
missile
nearest
at
hand
drysdale
instantly
discharged
at
it
as
the
spur
fell
to
the
floor
the
head
reappeared
in
the
room
and
as
quickly
disappeared
again
in
deference
to
the
other
spur
the
top
boots
an
ivory
handled
hair
brush
and
a
translation
of
euripides
which
in
turn
saluted
each
successive
appearance
of
said
head
and
the
grin
was
broader
on
each
reappearance
then
drysdale
having
no
other
article
within
reach
which
he
could
throw
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
in
which
sanders
and
the
head
heartily
joined
and
shouted
come
in
joe
you
old
fool
and
do
stand
bobbing
your
ugly
old
mug
in
and
out
there
like
a
jack
in
the
box
so
the
head
came
in
and
after
it
the
body
and
closed
the
door
behind
it
and
a
queer
body
it
was
of
about
fifty
years
standing
or
rather
slouching
clothed
in
an
old
fustian
coat
corduroy
breeches
and
gaiters
and
being
the
earthly
tabernacle
of
joe
muggles
the
of
aldate
how
the
deuce
did
you
get
by
the
lodge
joe
inquired
drysdale
joe
be
it
known
had
been
forbidden
the
college
for
importing
a
sack
of
rats
into
the
inner
quadrangle
upon
the
turf
of
which
a
match
at
had
come
off
between
the
terriers
of
two
this
little
event
might
have
passed
unnoticed
but
that
drysdale
had
bought
from
joe
a
dozen
of
the
slaughtered
rats
and
nailed
them
on
the
doors
of
the
four
college
tutors
three
to
a
door
whereupon
inquiry
had
been
made
and
joe
had
been
outlawed
oh
please
drysdale
sir
i
just
watched
the
porter
sir
across
to
the
buttery
to
get
his
mornin
and
then
i
tips
a
wink

the
under

joe
in
his
most

tone

and
joe
stopped
to
caress
jack
who
was
fawning
on
him
as
if
he
understood
every
word
well
joe
what
then
said
drysdale
so
you

drysdale
sir

my

well
drysdale
sir
that
was
what
my
mate
was
a
sayin
you
cool
heads
you
and
your
mate
said
drysdale
here
take
a
drink
and
get
out
and
i
think
about
it
drysdale
was
now
in
a
defiant
humor
and
resolved
not
to
let
sanders
think
that
his
presence
could
keep
him
from
any
act
of
folly
to
which
he
was
inclined
joe
took
his
drink
and
just
then
several
men
came
in
from
lecture
and
drew
off
drysdale
attention
from
jack
who
quietly
followed
joe
out
of
the
room
when
that
worthy
disappeared
drysdale
only
laughed
when
he
found
it
out
and
went
down
to
the
yard
that
afternoon
to
see
the
match
between
the
london
dog
and
his
own
pet
how
in
the
world
are
youngsters
with
unlimited
credit
plenty
of
ready
money
and
fast
tastes
to
be
kept
from
making
fools
and
blackguards
of
themselves
up
here
thought
sanders
as
he
strolled
back
to
his
college
and
it
is
a
question
which
has
exercised
other
heads
besides
his
and
probably
is
a
long
way
yet
from
being
well
solved
chapter
iv
the
ambrose
boat
club
its
ministery
and
their
budget
we
left
our
hero
a
short
time
back
busily
engaged
on
his
dinner
commons
and
resolved
forthwith
to
make
great
friends
with
hardy
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
could
be
the
slightest
difficulty
in
carrying
out
this
resolve
after
such
a
passage
as
they
two
had
had
together
that
afternoon
he
felt
that
the
usual
outworks
of
acquaintanceship
had
been
cleared
at
a
bound
and
looked
upon
hardy
already
as
an
old
friend
to
whom
he
could
talk
out
his
mind
as
freely
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
to
his
old
tutor
at
school
or
to
arthur
moreover
as
there
were
already
several
things
in
his
head
which
he
was
anxious
to
ventilate
he
was
all
the
more
pleased
that
chance
had
thrown
him
across
a
man
of
so
much
older
standing
than
himself
and
one
to
whom
he
instinctively
felt
that
he
could
look
up
accordingly
after
grace
had
been
said
and
he
saw
that
hardy
had
not
finished
his
dinner
but
sat
down
again
when
the
fellows
had
left
the
hall
he
strolled
out
meaning
to
wait
for
his
victim
outside
and
seize
upon
him
then
and
there
so
he
stopped
on
the
steps
outside
the
and
to
pass
the
time
joined
himself
to
one
or
two
other
men
with
whom
he
had
a
speaking
acquaintance
who
were
also
hanging
about
while
they
were
talking
hardy
came
out
of
the
hall
and
tom
turned
and
stepped
forward
meaning
to
speak
to
him
to
his
utter
discomfiture
hardy
walked
quickly
away
looking
straight
before
him
and
without
showing
by
look
or
gesture
that
he
was
conscious
of
our
hero
existence
or
had
ever
seen
him
before
in
his
life
tom
was
so
taken
aback
that
he
made
no
effort
to
follow
he
just
glanced
at
his
companions
to
see
whether
they
had
noticed
the
occurrence
and
was
glad
to
see
that
they
had
not
being
deep
in
the
discussion
of
the
merits
of
a
new
hunter
of
simmons
which
one
of
them
had
been
riding
so
he
walked
away
by
himself
to
consider
what
it
could
mean
but
the
more
he
puzzled
about
it
the
less
could
he
understand
it
surely
he
thought
hardy
must
have
seen
me
and
yet
if
he
had
why
did
he
not
recognize
me
my
cap
and
gown
ca
be
such
a
disguise
as
all
that
and
yet
common
decency
must
have
led
him
to
ask
whether
i
was
any
the
worse
for
my
ducking
if
he
knew
me
he
scouted
the
notion
which
suggested
itself
once
or
twice
that
hardy
meant
to
cut
him
and
so
not
being
able
to
come
to
any
reasonable
conclusion
suddenly
bethought
him
that
he
was
asked
to
a
and
putting
his
speculations
aside
for
a
moment
with
the
full
intention
nevertheless
of
clearing
up
the
mystery
as
soon
as
possible
he
betook
himself
to
the
rooms
of
his
entertainer
they
were
rooms
in
the
second
quadrangle
furnished
plainly
but
well
so
far
as
tom
could
judge
but
as
they
were
now
laid
out
for
the
they
had
lost
all
individual
character
for
the
time
everyone
of
us
i
suppose
is
fond
of
studying
the
rooms
chambers
dens
in
short
of
whatever
sort
they
may
be
of
our
friends
and
acquaintances
at
least
i
knew
that
i
myself
like
to
see
what
sort
of
a
chair
a
man
sits
in
where
he
puts
it
what
books
lie
or
stand
on
the
shelves
nearest
his
hand
what
the
objects
are
which
he
keeps
most
familiarly
before
him
in
that
particular
nook
of
the
earth
surface
in
which
he
is
most
at
home
where
he
pulls
off
his
coat
collar
and
boots
and
gets
into
an
old
easy
and
his
broadest
slippers
fine
houses
and
fine
rooms
have
little
attraction
for
most
men
and
those
who
have
the
finest
are
probably
the
most
bored
by
them
but
the
den
of
the
man
you
like
or
are
disposed
to
like
has
the
strongest
and
strangest
attraction
for
you
however
an
oxford
room
set
out
for
a
can
tell
you
nothing
all
the
characteristics
are
shoved
away
into
the
background
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
long
mahogany
set
out
with
bottles
glasses
and
dessert
in
the
present
instance
the
preparations
for
festivity
were
pretty
much
what
they
ought
to
be
good
sound
port
and
sherry
biscuits
and
a
plate
or
two
of
nuts
and
dried
fruits
the
host
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
board
was
one
of
the
of
the
college
he
was
treasurer
of
the
club
and
also
a
kind
of
a
boating
nurse
who
and
trained
the
young
oars
and
in
this
capacity
had
been
in
command
of
the
freshmen
in
which
tom
had
been
learning
his
rudiments
he
was
a
heavy
burly
man
naturally
awkward
in
his
movements
but
gifted
with
a
steady
sort
of
dogged
enthusiasm
and
by
dint
of
hard
and
constant
training
had
made
himself
into
a
most
useful
oar
fit
for
any
place
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
in
the
two
years
of
his
residence
he
had
pulled
down
to
sandford
every
day
except
sundays
and
much
farther
whenever
he
could
get
anybody
to
accompany
him
he
was
the
most
good
natured
man
in
the
world
very
badly
dressed
very
short
sighted
and
called
everybody
old
fellow
his
name
was
simple
smith
generally
known
as
diogenes
smith
from
an
eccentric
habit
which
he
had
of
making
an
easy
chair
of
his
hip
bath
malicious
acquaintance
declared
that
when
smith
first
came
up
and
having
paid
the
valuation
for
the
furniture
in
his
rooms
came
to
inspect
the
same
the
tub
in
question
had
been
left
by
chance
in
the
and
that
smith
not
having
the
faintest
idea
of
its
proper
use
had
by
the
exercise
of
his
natural
reason
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
could
only
be
meant
for
a
man
to
sit
in
and
so
had
kept
it
in
his
and
had
taken
to
it
as
an
this
i
have
reason
to
believe
was
a
libel
certain
it
is
however
that
in
his
first
term
he
was
discovered
sitting
solemnly
in
the
tub
by
his
with
his
spectacles
on
playing
the
flute
the
only
other
recreation
besides
boating
in
which
he
indulged
and
no
amount
of
quizzing
could
get
him
out
of
the
habit
when
alone
or
with
only
one
or
two
friends
in
his
room
he
still
occupied
the
tub
and
declared
that
it
was
the
most
perfect
of
seats
hitherto
invented
and
above
all
adapted
for
the
recreation
of
a
boating
man
to
whom
cushioned
seats
should
be
an
abomination
he
was
naturally
a
very
hospitable
man
and
on
this
night
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
his
rooms
pleasant
to
all
comers
as
it
was
a
sort
of
opening
for
the
boating
season
this
wine
of
his
was
a
business
matter
in
fact
to
which
diogenes
had
invited
officially
as
treasurer
of
the
every
man
who
had
ever
shown
the
least
tendency
to
pulling
many
with
whom
he
had
scarcely
a
nodding
acquaintance
for
miller
the
coxswain
had
come
up
at
last
he
had
taken
his
degree
in
the
michaelmas
term
and
had
been
very
near
starting
for
a
tour
in
the
east
upon
turning
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
however
miller
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
palestine
and
egypt
and
greece
could
not
run
away
but
that
unless
he
was
there
to
keep
matters
going
the
ambrose
boat
would
lose
the
best
chance
it
was
ever
likely
to
have
of
getting
to
the
head
of
the
river
so
he
had
patriotically
resolved
to
reside
till
june
read
divinity
and
coach
the
racing
crew
and
had
written
to
diogenes
to
call
together
the
whole
boating
interest
of
the
college
that
they
might
set
to
work
at
once
in
good
earnest
tom
and
the
three
or
four
other
freshmen
present
were
duly
presented
to
miller
as
they
came
in
who
looked
them
over
as
the
colonel
of
a
crack
regiment
might
look
over
horses
at
with
a
single
eye
to
their
bone
and
muscle
and
how
much
work
might
be
got
out
of
them
they
then
gathered
towards
the
lower
end
of
the
long
table
and
surveyed
the
celebrities
at
the
upper
end
with
much
respect
miller
the
coxswain
sat
on
the
host
right
hand
a
slight
resolute
fiery
little
man
with
curly
black
hair
he
was
peculiarly
qualified
by
nature
for
the
task
which
he
had
set
himself
and
it
takes
no
mean
qualities
to
keep
a
boat
crew
well
together
and
in
order
perhaps
he
erred
a
little
on
the
side
of
and
severity
and
he
certainly
would
have
been
more
popular
had
his
manners
been
a
thought
more
courteous
but
the
men
who
rebelled
most
against
his
tyranny
grumblingly
confessed
that
he
was
a
coxswain
a
very
different
man
was
the
captain
of
the
boat
who
sat
opposite
to
miller
altogether
a
noble
specimen
of
a
very
noble
type
of
our
countrymen
tall
and
strong
of
body
courageous
and
tolerant
of
all
men
sparing
of
speech
but
ready
in
action
a
thoroughly
well
balanced
modest
quiet
englishman
one
of
those
who
do
a
good
stroke
of
the
work
of
the
country
without
getting
much
credit
for
it
or
even
becoming
aware
of
the
fact
for
the
last
thing
such
men
understand
is
how
to
blow
their
own
trumpets
he
was
perhaps
too
easy
for
the
captain
of
ambrose
at
any
rate
miller
was
always
telling
him
so
but
if
he
was
not
strict
enough
with
others
he
never
spared
himself
and
was
as
good
as
three
men
in
the
boat
at
a
pinch
but
if
i
venture
on
more
introductions
my
readers
will
get
bewildered
so
i
must
close
the
list
much
as
i
should
like
to
make
them
known
to
fortis
gyas
fortisque
cloanthus
who
sat
round
the
chiefs
laughing
and
consulting
and
speculating
on
the
chances
of
the
coming
races
no
stay
there
is
one
other
man
they
must
make
room
for
here
he
comes
rather
late
in
a
very
glossy
hat
the
only
man
in
the
room
not
in
cap
and
gown
he
walks
up
and
takes
his
place
by
the
side
of
the
host
as
a
matter
of
course
a
handsome
pale
man
with
a
dark
quick
eye
conscious
that
he
draws
attention
wherever
he
goes
and
apparently
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
right
who
is
that
who
has
just
come
in
in
beaver
said
tom
touching
the
next
man
to
him
oh
do
you
know
that
blake
he
the
most
wonderful
fellow
in
oxford
answered
his
neighbor
how
do
you
mean
said
tom
why
he
can
do
everything
better
than
almost
anybody
and
without
any
trouble
at
all
miller
was
obliged
to
have
him
in
the
boat
last
year
though
he
never
trained
a
bit
then
he
in
the
eleven
and
is
a
wonderful
rider
and
and
shot
ay
and
he
so
awfully
clever
with
it
all
joined
in
the
man
on
the
other
side
he
be
a
safe
first
though
i
do
believe
he
reads
more
than
you
or
i
he
can
write
songs
too
as
fast
as
you
can
talk
nearly
and
sings
them
wonderfully
is
he
of
our
college
then
yes
of
course
or
he
could
have
been
in
our
boat
last
year
but
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
him
in
chapel
or
hall
no
i
daresay
not
he
hardly
ever
goes
to
either
and
yet
he
manages
never
to
get
hauled
up
much
no
one
knows
how
he
never
gets
up
now
till
the
afternoon
and
sits
up
nearly
all
night
playing
cards
with
the
fastest
fellows
or
going
round
singing
glees
at
three
or
four
in
the
morning
tom
sipped
his
port
and
looked
with
great
interest
at
the
admirable
crichton
of
ambrose
and
after
watching
him
a
few
moments
said
in
a
low
voice
to
his
neighbor
how
wretched
he
looks
i
never
saw
a
sadder
face
poor
blake
one
ca
help
calling
him
poor
although
he
himself
would
have
winced
at
it
more
than
any
name
you
could
have
called
him
you
might
have
admired
feared
or
wondered
at
him
and
he
would
have
been
pleased
the
object
of
his
life
was
to
raise
such
feelings
in
his
neighbors
but
pity
was
the
last
which
he
would
like
to
excite
he
was
indeed
a
wonderfully
gifted
fellow
full
of
all
sorts
of
energy
and
talent
and
power
and
tenderness
and
yet
as
his
face
told
only
too
truly
to
anyone
who
watched
him
when
he
was
exerting
himself
in
society
one
of
the
most
wretched
men
in
the
college
he
had
a
passion
for
success
for
beating
everybody
else
in
whatever
he
took
in
hand
and
that
too
without
seeming
to
make
any
great
effort
himself
the
doing
a
thing
well
and
thoroughly
gave
him
no
satisfaction
unless
he
could
feel
that
he
was
doing
it
better
and
more
easily
than
a
b
or
c
and
they
felt
and
acknowledged
this
he
had
had
full
swing
of
success
for
two
years
and
now
the
nemesis
was
coming
for
although
not
an
extravagant
man
many
of
the
pursuits
in
which
he
has
eclipsed
all
rivals
were
far
beyond
the
means
of
any
but
a
rich
one
and
blake
was
not
rich
he
had
a
fair
allowance
but
by
the
end
of
his
first
year
was
considerably
in
debt
and
at
the
time
we
are
speaking
of
the
whole
pack
of
oxford
tradesmen
into
whose
books
he
had
got
having
smelt
out
the
leaness
of
his
expectations
were
upon
him
besieging
him
for
payment
this
miserable
and
constant
annoyance
was
wearing
his
soul
out
this
was
the
reason
why
his
oak
was
sported
and
he
was
never
seen
till
the
afternoons
and
turned
night
into
day
he
was
too
proud
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
his
persecutors
even
had
it
been
possible
and
now
at
his
sorest
need
his
whole
scheme
of
life
was
failing
him
his
love
of
success
was
turning
into
ashes
in
his
mouth
he
felt
much
more
disgust
than
pleasure
at
his
triumphs
over
other
men
and
yet
the
habit
of
striving
for
successes
notwithstanding
its
irksomeness
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
poor
blake
he
was
living
on
from
hand
to
mouth
flashing
out
in
his
old
brilliancy
and
power
and
forcing
himself
to
take
the
lead
in
whatever
company
he
might
be
but
utterly
lonely
and
depressed
when
by
himself
reading
feverishly
in
secret
in
a
desperate
effort
to
retrieve
all
by
high
honors
and
a
fellowship
as
tom
said
to
his
neighbor
there
was
no
sadder
face
than
his
to
be
seen
in
oxford
and
yet
at
this
very
wine
party
he
was
the
life
of
everything
as
he
sat
up
there
between
diogenes
whom
he
kept
in
a
constant
sort
of
mild
epileptic
fit
from
laughter
and
wine
going
the
wrong
way
for
whenever
diogenes
raised
his
glass
blake
shot
him
with
some
joke
and
the
captain
who
watched
him
with
the
most
undisguised
admiration
a
singular
contrast
the
two
men
miller
though
blake
was
the
torment
of
his
life
relaxed
after
the
first
quarter
of
all
hour
and
our
hero
by
the
same
time
gave
himself
credit
for
being
a
much
greater
ass
than
he
was
for
having
ever
thought
blake
face
a
sad
one
when
the
room
was
quite
full
and
enough
wine
had
been
drunk
to
open
the
hearts
of
the
guests
diogenes
rose
on
a
signal
from
miller
and
opened
the
budget
the
financial
statement
was
a
satisfactory
one
the
club
was
almost
free
of
debt
and
comparing
their
position
with
that
of
other
colleges
diogenes
advised
that
they
might
fairly
burden
themselves
a
little
more
and
then
if
they
would
stand
a
whip
of
ten
shillings
a
man
they
might
have
a
new
boat
which
he
believed
they
all
would
agree
had
become
necessary
miller
supported
the
new
boat
in
a
pungent
little
speech
and
the
captain
when
appealed
to
nodded
and
said
he
thought
they
must
have
one
so
the
small
supplies
and
the
large
addition
to
the
club
debt
was
voted
unanimously
and
the
captain
miller
and
blake
who
had
many
notions
as
to
the
flooring
lines
and
keel
of
a
racing
boat
were
appointed
to
order
and
superintend
the
building
soon
afterwards
coffee
came
in
and
cigars
were
lighted
a
large
section
of
the
party
went
off
to
play
pool
others
to
stroll
about
the
streets
others
to
whist
a
few
let
us
hope
to
their
own
rooms
to
read
but
these
latter
were
a
sadly
small
minority
even
in
the
quietest
of
ambrose
parties
tom
who
was
fascinated
by
the
heroes
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
steadily
on
sidling
up
towards
them
as
the
intermediate
places
became
vacant
and
at
last
attained
the
next
chair
but
one
to
the
captain
where
for
the
time
he
sat
in
perfect
bliss
blake
and
miller
were
telling
boating
stories
of
the
henley
and
thames
regattas
the
latter
of
which
had
been
lately
started
with
great
and
from
these
great
yearly
events
and
the
deeds
of
prowess
done
thereat
the
talk
came
gradually
round
to
the
next
races
now
captain
said
miller
suddenly
have
you
thought
yet
what
new
men
we
are
to
try
in
the
crew
this
year
no
my
honor
i
have
said
the
captain
i
reading
and
have
no
time
to
spare
besides
after
all
there
lots
of
time
to
think
about
it
here
we
only
half
through
lent
term
and
the
races
do
begin
till
the
end
of
easter
term
it
wo
do
said
miller
we
must
get
the
crew
together
this
term
well
you
and
smith
put
your
heads
together
and
manage
it
said
the
captain
i
will
go
down
any
day
and
as
often
as
you
like
at
two
let
see
said
miller
to
smith
how
many
of
the
old
crew
have
we
left
five
counting
blake
answered
diogenes
counting
me
well
that
cool
laughed
blake
you
old
tub
haunting
why
am
i
not
to
be
counted
you
never
will
train
you
see
said
diogenes
smith
is
quite
right
said
miller
there
no
counting
on
you
blake
now
be
a
good
fellow
and
promise
to
be
regular
this
year
i
promise
to
do
my
work
in
a
race
which
is
more
than
some
of
your
men
will
do
said
blake
rather
piqued
well
you
know
what
i
think
on
the
subject
said
miller
but
who
have
we
got
for
the
other
three
places
there
drysdale
would
do
said
diogenes
i
hear
he
was
a
capital
oar
at
eton
and
so
though
i
do
know
him
i
managed
to
get
him
once
down
last
term
he
would
do
famously
for
or
if
he
would
pull
do
you
think
he
will
blake
you
know
him
i
suppose
said
miller
yes
i
know
him
well
enough
said
blake
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
added
i
do
think
you
get
him
to
train
much
well
we
must
try
said
miller
now
who
else
is
there
smith
went
through
four
or
five
names
at
each
of
which
miller
shook
his
head
any
promising
freshmen
said
he
at
last
none
better
than
brown
here
said
smith
i
think
he
do
well
if
he
will
only
work
and
stand
being
coached
have
you
ever
pulled
much
said
miller
no
said
tom
never
till
this
last
month
since
i
been
up
here
all
the
better
said
miller
now
captain
you
hear
we
may
probably
have
to
go
in
with
three
new
hands
they
must
get
into
your
stroke
this
term
or
we
shall
be
nowhere
very
well
said
the
captain
i
give
from
two
till
five
any
days
you
like
and
now
let
go
and
have
one
pool
said
blake
getting
up
come
captain
just
one
little
pool
after
all
this
business
diogenes
insisted
on
staying
to
play
his
flute
miller
was
engaged
but
the
captain
with
a
little
coaxing
was
led
away
by
blake
and
asked
tom
to
accompany
them
when
he
saw
that
he
was
looking
as
if
he
would
like
it
so
the
three
went
off
to
the
tom
in
such
spirits
at
the
chance
of
being
tried
in
the
crew
that
he
hardly
noticed
the
exceedingly
bad
exchange
which
he
had
involuntarily
made
of
his
new
cap
and
gown
for
a
cap
with
the
board
broken
into
several
pieces
and
a
fusty
old
gown
which
had
been
about
college
probably
for
ten
generations
morality
in
the
matter
of
caps
and
gowns
seems
to
be
founded
on
the
celebrated
maxim
propriete
le
vol
they
found
the
ambrose
full
of
the
fast
set
and
tom
enjoyed
his
game
much
though
his
three
lives
were
soon
disposed
of
the
captain
and
blake
were
the
last
lives
on
the
board
and
divided
the
pool
at
blake
suggestion
he
had
scarcely
nerve
for
playing
out
a
single
handed
match
with
such
an
steady
piece
of
humanity
as
the
captain
though
he
was
the
more
brilliant
player
of
the
two
the
party
then
broke
up
and
tom
returned
to
his
rooms
and
when
he
was
by
himself
again
his
thoughts
recurred
to
hardy
how
odd
he
thought
that
they
never
mentioned
him
for
the
boat
could
he
have
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
how
was
it
that
nobody
seemed
to
know
him
and
he
to
know
nobody
most
readers
i
doubt
not
will
think
our
hero
very
green
for
being
puzzled
at
so
simple
a
matter
and
no
doubt
the
steps
in
the
social
scale
in
england
are
very
clearly
marked
out
and
we
all
come
to
the
appreciation
of
the
gradations
sooner
or
later
but
our
hero
previous
education
must
be
taken
into
consideration
he
had
not
been
instructed
at
home
to
worship
mere
conventional
distinctions
of
rank
or
wealth
and
had
gone
to
a
school
which
was
not
frequented
by
persons
of
rank
and
where
no
one
knew
whether
a
boy
was
heir
to
a
principality
or
would
have
to
fight
his
own
way
in
the
world
so
he
was
rather
taken
by
surprise
at
what
he
found
to
be
the
state
of
things
at
ambrose
and
did
easily
realize
it
chapter
v
hardy
the
servitor
it
was
not
long
before
tom
had
effected
his
object
in
part
that
is
to
say
he
had
caught
hardy
several
times
in
the
quadrangle
coming
out
of
lecture
hall
or
chapel
and
had
fastened
himself
upon
him
often
walking
with
him
even
up
to
the
door
of
his
rooms
but
there
matters
ended
hardy
was
very
civil
and
gentlemanly
he
even
seemed
pleased
with
the
volunteered
companionship
but
there
was
undoubtedly
a
coolness
about
him
which
tom
could
not
make
out
but
as
he
only
liked
hardy
more
the
more
he
saw
of
him
he
very
soon
made
up
his
mind
to
break
ground
himself
and
to
make
a
dash
at
any
rate
for
something
more
than
a
mere
speaking
acquaintance
one
evening
he
had
as
usual
walked
from
hall
with
hardy
up
to
his
door
they
stopped
a
moment
talking
and
then
hardy
the
door
said
well
goodnight
perhaps
we
shall
meet
on
the
river
and
was
going
in
when
tom
looking
him
in
the
face
blurted
out
i
say
hardy
i
wish
you
let
me
come
in
and
sit
with
you
a
bit
i
never
ask
a
man
of
our
college
into
my
rooms
answered
the
other
but
come
in
by
all
means
if
you
like
and
so
they
entered
the
room
was
the
worst
both
in
situation
and
furniture
which
tom
had
yet
seen
it
was
on
the
ground
floor
with
only
one
window
which
looked
out
into
a
back
yard
where
were
the
offices
of
the
college
all
day
and
up
to
nine
at
night
the
yard
and
offices
were
filled
with
scouts
boys
cleaning
boots
and
knives
emptying
slops
and
tattling
scandal
scullions
peeling
potatoes
and
listening
and
the
butchers
and
men
who
supply
the
college
and
loitering
about
to
gossip
and
get
a
taste
of
the
college
ale
before
going
about
their
business
the
room
was
large
but
low
and
close
and
the
floor
uneven
the
furniture
did
not
add
to
the
cheerfulness
of
the
apartment
it
consisted
of
one
large
table
in
the
middle
covered
with
an
old
chequered
and
an
oxford
table
near
the
window
on
which
lay
books
with
writing
materials
a
couple
of
plain
windsor
chairs
occupied
the
two
sides
of
the
fireplace
and
common
wooden
chairs
stood
against
the
opposite
wall
three
on
each
side
of
a
while
an
old
rickety
sofa
covered
with
soiled
chintz
leaned
against
the
wall
which
fronted
the
window
as
if
to
rest
its
lame
leg
the
carpet
and
rug
were
dingy
and
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
and
the
college
had
evidently
neglected
to
paper
the
room
or
whitewash
the
ceiling
for
several
generations
on
the
reposed
a
few
long
clay
pipes
and
a
brown
earthenware
receptacle
for
tobacco
together
with
a
japanned
tin
case
shaped
like
a
figure
of
eight
the
use
of
which
puzzled
tom
exceedingly
one
modestly
framed
drawing
of
a
brig
hung
above
and
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
a
sword
and
belt
all
this
tom
had
time
to
remark
by
the
light
of
the
fire
which
was
burning
brightly
while
his
host
produced
a
couple
of
brass
candlesticks
from
his
cupboard
and
lighted
up
and
drew
the
curtain
before
his
window
then
tom
instinctively
left
off
taking
his
notes
for
fear
of
hurting
the
other
feelings
just
as
he
would
have
gone
on
doing
and
making
remarks
on
everything
had
the
rooms
been
models
of
taste
and
comfort
and
throwing
his
cap
and
gown
on
the
sofa
sat
down
on
one
of
the
windsor
chairs
what
a
jolly
chair
said
he
where
do
you
get
them
i
should
like
to
buy
one
yes
they
comfortable
enough
said
hardy
but
the
reason
i
have
them
is
that
they
the
cheapest
armchair
one
can
get
i
like
an
and
ca
afford
to
have
any
other
than
these
tom
dropped
the
subject
of
the
chairs
at
once
following
his
instinct
again
which
sad
to
say
was
already
teaching
him
that
poverty
is
a
disgrace
to
a
briton
and
that
until
you
know
a
man
thoroughly
you
must
always
seem
to
assume
that
he
is
the
owner
of
unlimited
ready
money
somehow
or
another
he
began
to
feel
embarrassed
and
could
think
of
anything
to
say
as
his
host
took
down
the
pipes
and
tobacco
from
the
and
placed
them
on
the
table
however
anything
was
better
than
silence
so
he
began
again
very
rooms
yours
seem
said
he
taking
up
a
pipe
mechanically
big
enough
for
the
matter
of
that
answered
the
other
but
very
dark
and
noisy
in
the
so
i
should
think
said
tom
do
you
know
i
sooner
now
have
my
freshman
rooms
up
in
the
garrets
i
wonder
you
change
i
get
these
for
nothing
said
his
host
putting
his
long
clay
to
the
candle
and
puffing
out
volumes
of
smoke
tom
felt
more
and
more
unequal
to
the
situation
and
filled
his
pipe
in
silence
the
first
whiff
made
him
cough
as
he
was
used
to
the
fragrant
weed
in
this
shape
i
afraid
you
do
smoke
tobacco
said
his
host
from
behind
his
own
cloud
shall
i
go
out
and
fetch
you
a
cigar
i
smoke
them
myself
i
ca
afford
it
no
thank
you
said
tom
blushing
for
shame
as
if
he
had
come
there
only
to
insult
his
host
and
wishing
himself
heartily
out
of
it
i
got
my
case
here
and
the
fact
is
i
will
smoke
a
cigar
if
you
allow
me
for
i
not
up
to
pipes
yet
i
wish
you
take
some
he
went
on
emptying
his
cigars
on
to
the
table
replied
his
host
i
prefer
a
pipe
and
now
what
will
you
have
to
drink
i
do
keep
wine
but
i
can
get
a
bottle
of
anything
you
like
from
the
common
room
that
one
of
privileges
he
gave
a
grim
chuckle
as
he
emphasised
the
word
our
who
on
earth
are
thought
tom
servitors
i
suppose
for
he
knew
already
that
undergraduates
in
general
could
not
get
wine
from
the
college
cellars
i
do
care
a
straw
about
wine
said
he
feeling
very
hot
about
the
ears
a
glass
of
beer
or
anything
you
have
here
or
tea
well
i
can
give
you
a
pretty
good
glass
of
whiskey
said
his
host
going
to
the
cupboard
and
producing
a
black
bottle
two
tumblers
of
different
sizes
some
little
wooden
toddy
ladles
and
sugar
in
an
old
cracked
glass
tom
vowed
that
if
there
was
one
thing
in
the
world
he
liked
more
than
another
it
was
whiskey
and
began
measuring
out
the
liquor
carefully
into
his
tumbler
and
rolling
it
round
between
his
eyes
and
the
candle
and
smelling
it
to
show
what
a
treat
it
was
to
him
while
his
host
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
to
ascertain
that
it
had
quit
boiling
and
then
as
it
spluttered
and
fizzed
filled
up
the
two
tumblers
and
restored
it
to
its
place
on
the
hob
tom
swallowed
some
of
the
mixture
which
nearly
made
him
cough
again
for
though
it
was
very
good
it
was
also
very
potent
however
by
an
effort
he
managed
to
swallow
his
cough
he
would
about
as
soon
have
lost
a
little
finger
as
let
it
out
then
to
his
great
relief
his
host
took
the
pipe
from
his
lips
and
inquired
how
do
you
like
oxford
i
hardly
know
yet
said
tom
the
first
few
days
i
was
delighted
with
going
about
and
seeing
the
buildings
and
finding
out
who
had
lived
in
each
of
the
old
colleges
and
pottering
about
in
the
bodleian
and
fancying
i
should
like
to
be
a
great
scholar
then
i
met
several
old
school
fellows
going
about
who
are
up
at
other
colleges
and
went
to
their
rooms
and
talked
over
old
times
but
none
of
my
very
intimate
friends
are
up
yet
and
unless
you
care
very
much
about
a
man
already
you
do
seem
likely
to
get
intimate
with
him
up
here
unless
he
is
at
your
own
college
he
paused
as
if
expecting
an
answer
i
daresay
not
said
hardy
but
i
never
was
at
a
public
school
unluckily
and
so
am
no
judge
well
then
as
to
the
college
life
went
on
tom
it
all
very
well
as
far
as
it
goes
there
plenty
of
liberty
and
good
food
and
the
men
seem
nice
fellows
many
of
them
at
least
so
far
as
i
can
judge
but
i
ca
say
that
i
like
it
as
much
as
i
liked
our
school
life
i
do
understand
said
hardy
why
not
oh
i
hardly
know
said
tom
laughing
i
do
seem
as
if
i
had
anything
to
do
here
that
one
reason
i
think
and
then
you
see
at
rugby
i
was
rather
a
great
man
there
one
had
a
share
in
the
ruling
of
boys
and
a
good
deal
of
responsibility
but
here
one
has
only
just
to
take
care
of
oneself
and
keep
out
of
scrapes
and
that
what
i
never
could
do
what
do
you
think
a
fellow
ought
to
do
now
up
here
oh
i
do
see
much
difficulty
in
that
said
his
host
smiling
get
up
your
lectures
well
to
begin
with
but
my
lectures
are
a
farce
said
tom
i
done
all
the
books
over
and
over
again
they
do
take
me
an
hour
a
day
to
get
up
well
then
set
to
work
reading
something
regularly
reading
for
your
degree
for
instance
oh
hang
it
i
ca
look
so
far
forward
as
that
i
sha
be
going
up
for
three
years
you
ca
begin
too
early
you
might
go
and
talk
to
your
about
it
so
i
did
said
tom
at
least
i
meant
to
do
it
for
he
asked
me
and
two
other
freshmen
to
breakfast
the
other
morning
and
i
was
going
to
open
out
to
him
but
when
i
got
there
i
was
quite
shut
up
he
never
looked
one
of
us
in
the
face
and
talked
in
set
sentences
and
was
cold
and
formal
and
condescending
the
only
bit
of
advice
he
gave
us
was
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
boating
just
the
one
thing
which
i
feel
a
real
interest
in
i
could
get
out
a
word
of
what
i
wanted
to
say
it
is
unlucky
certainly
that
our
present
tutors
take
so
little
interest
in
anything
which
the
men
care
about
but
it
is
more
from
shyness
than
anything
else
that
manner
which
you
noticed
you
may
be
sure
that
he
was
more
wretched
and
embarrassed
than
any
of
you
well
but
now
i
should
really
like
to
know
what
you
did
yourself
said
tom
you
are
the
only
man
of
much
older
standing
than
myself
whom
i
know
at
all
yet
i
mean
i
do
know
anybody
else
well
enough
to
talk
about
this
sort
of
thing
to
them
what
did
you
do
now
besides
learning
to
pull
in
your
first
year
i
had
learnt
to
pull
before
i
came
up
here
said
hardy
i
really
hardly
remember
what
i
did
besides
read
you
see
i
came
up
with
a
definite
purpose
of
reading
my
father
was
very
anxious
that
i
should
become
a
good
scholar
then
my
position
in
the
college
and
my
poverty
naturally
kept
me
out
of
the
many
things
which
other
men
do
tom
flushed
again
at
the
ugly
word
but
not
so
much
as
at
first
hardy
could
mind
the
subject
or
he
would
never
be
forcing
it
up
at
every
turn
he
thought
you
would
think
it
he
began
again
harping
on
the
same
string
but
i
can
hardly
tell
you
how
i
miss
the
sort
of
responsibility
i
was
talking
to
you
about
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
get
the
vacuum
filled
up
before
long
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
see
how
yet
you
will
be
a
very
lucky
fellow
if
you
do
find
it
quite
as
much
as
you
can
do
to
keep
yourself
in
order
up
here
it
is
about
the
toughest
part
of
a
man
life
i
do
believe
the
time
he
has
spent
here
my
university
life
has
been
so
different
altogether
from
what
yours
will
be
that
my
experience
is
likely
to
benefit
you
i
wish
you
would
try
me
though
said
tom
you
do
know
what
a
teachable
sort
of
a
fellow
i
am
if
any
body
will
take
me
the
right
way
you
taught
me
to
scull
you
know
or
at
least
put
me
in
a
way
to
learn
but
sculling
and
rowing
and
cricket
and
all
the
rest
of
it
with
such
reading
as
i
am
likely
to
do
wo
be
enough
i
feel
sure
of
that
already
i
do
think
it
will
said
hardy
no
amount
of
physical
or
mental
work
will
fill
the
vacuum
you
were
talking
of
just
now
it
is
the
empty
house
swept
and
garnished
which
the
boy
might
have
had
glimpses
of
but
the
man
finds
yawning
within
him
which
must
be
filled
somehow
it
a
pretty
good
three
years
work
to
learn
how
to
keep
the
devils
out
of
it
more
or
less
by
the
time
you
take
your
degree
at
least
i
have
found
it
so
hardy
rose
and
took
a
turn
or
two
up
and
down
his
room
he
was
astonished
at
finding
himself
talking
so
unreservedly
to
one
of
whom
he
knew
so
little
and
the
words
recalled
he
lived
much
alone
and
thought
himself
morbid
and
too
why
should
he
be
filling
a
youngster
head
with
puzzles
how
did
he
know
that
they
were
thinking
of
the
same
thing
but
the
spoken
word
can
not
be
recalled
it
must
go
on
its
way
for
good
or
evil
and
this
one
set
the
hearer
staring
into
the
ashes
and
putting
many
things
together
in
his
head
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
broke
silence
but
at
last
he
gathered
up
his
thoughts
and
said
well
i
hope
i
shirk
when
the
time
comes
you
do
think
a
fellow
need
shut
himself
up
though
i
sure
i
should
be
any
the
better
for
that
no
i
do
think
you
would
said
hardy
because
you
see
tom
went
on
waxing
bolder
and
more
confidential
if
i
were
to
take
to
moping
by
myself
i
read
as
you
or
any
sensible
fellow
would
do
i
know
that
well
enough
i
should
just
begin
sitting
with
my
legs
upon
the
and
looking
into
my
own
inside
i
see
you
are
laughing
but
you
know
what
mean
do
you
now
yes
staring
into
the
vacuum
you
were
talking
of
just
now
it
all
comes
back
to
that
said
hardy
well
perhaps
it
does
said
tom
and
i
do
believe
it
does
a
fellow
a
bit
of
good
to
be
thinking
about
himself
and
his
own
doings
only
he
ca
help
himself
said
hardy
let
him
throw
himself
as
he
will
into
all
that
is
going
on
up
here
after
all
he
must
be
alone
for
a
great
part
of
his
time
all
night
at
any
rate
and
when
he
gets
his
oak
sported
it
all
up
with
him
he
must
be
looking
more
or
less
into
his
own
inside
as
you
call
it
then
i
hope
he
wo
find
it
as
ugly
a
business
as
i
do
if
he
does
i
sure
he
ca
be
worse
employed
i
do
know
that
said
hardy
he
ca
learn
anything
worth
learning
in
any
other
way
oh
i
like
that
said
tom
it
worth
learning
how
to
play
tennis
and
how
to
speak
the
truth
you
ca
learn
either
by
thinking
of
yourself
ever
so
much
you
must
know
the
truth
before
you
can
speak
it
said
hardy
so
you
always
do
in
plenty
of
time
how
said
hardy
oh
i
do
know
said
tom
by
a
sort
of
instinct
i
suppose
i
never
in
my
life
felt
any
doubt
about
what
i
to
say
or
do
did
you
well
yours
is
a
good
comfortable
working
belief
at
any
rate
said
hardy
smiling
and
i
should
advise
you
to
hold
on
to
it
as
long
as
you
can
but
you
do
think
i
can
very
long
eh
no
but
men
are
very
different
there
no
saying
if
you
were
going
to
get
out
of
the
business
altogether
though
why
should
you
have
brought
the
subject
up
at
all
it
looks
awkward
for
you
does
it
tom
began
to
feel
rather
forlorn
at
this
suggestion
and
probably
betrayed
it
in
his
face
for
hardy
changed
the
subject
suddenly
how
do
you
get
on
in
the
boat
i
saw
you
going
down
and
thought
the
time
much
better
tom
felt
greatly
relieved
as
he
was
beginning
to
find
himself
in
rather
deep
water
so
he
rushed
into
boating
with
great
zest
and
the
two
chatted
on
very
pleasantly
on
that
and
other
matters
the
college
clock
struck
during
a
pause
in
their
talk
and
tom
looked
at
his
watch
eight
i
declare
he
said
why
i
must
have
been
here
more
than
two
hours
i
afraid
now
you
have
been
wanting
to
work
and
i
have
kept
you
from
it
with
my
talk
no
it
saturday
night
besides
i
do
get
much
society
that
i
care
about
and
so
i
enjoy
it
all
the
more
wo
you
stop
and
have
some
tea
tom
gladly
consented
and
his
host
produced
a
somewhat
dilapidated
set
of
crockery
and
proceeded
to
brew
the
drink
least
appreciated
at
ambrose
tom
watched
him
in
silence
much
excercised
in
his
mind
as
to
what
manner
of
man
he
had
fallen
upon
very
much
astonished
at
himself
for
having
opened
out
so
freely
and
feeling
a
desire
to
know
more
about
hardy
not
unmixed
with
a
sort
of
nervousness
as
to
how
he
was
to
accomplish
it
when
hardy
sat
down
again
and
began
pouring
out
the
tea
curiosity
overcame
and
he
opened
with
so
you
read
nights
after
hall
yes
for
two
or
three
hours
longer
when
i
am
in
a
good
humor
what
all
by
yourself
generally
but
once
or
twice
a
week
grey
comes
in
to
compare
notes
do
you
know
him
no
at
least
he
has
called
on
me
i
have
just
spoken
to
him
he
is
a
quiet
fellow
and
i
daresay
does
call
on
any
man
unless
he
knew
something
of
him
before
do
you
never
said
hardy
shortly
and
added
after
a
short
pause
very
few
men
would
thank
me
if
i
did
most
would
think
it
impertinent
and
i
too
proud
to
risk
that
tom
was
on
the
point
of
asking
why
but
the
uncomfortable
feeling
which
he
had
nearly
lost
came
back
on
him
i
suppose
one
very
soon
gets
tired
of
the
wine
and
supper
party
life
though
i
own
i
find
it
pleasant
enough
now
i
have
never
been
tired
said
hardy
servitors
are
not
troubled
with
that
sort
of
a
thing
if
they
were
i
would
go
unless
i
could
return
them
and
that
i
ca
afford
there
he
goes
again
thought
tom
why
will
he
be
throwing
that
old
story
in
my
face
over
and
over
again
he
ca
think
i
care
about
his
poverty
i
wo
change
the
subject
this
time
at
any
rate
and
so
he
said
you
do
mean
to
say
it
makes
any
real
difference
to
a
man
in
society
up
here
whether
he
is
poor
or
rich
i
mean
of
course
if
he
is
a
gentleman
and
a
good
fellow
yes
it
does
the
very
greatest
possible
but
do
take
my
word
for
it
keep
your
eyes
open
and
judge
for
yourself
i
daresay
prejudiced
on
the
subject
well
i
sha
believe
it
if
i
can
help
it
said
tom
you
know
you
said
just
now
that
you
never
called
on
any
one
perhaps
you
do
give
men
a
fair
chance
they
might
be
glad
to
know
you
if
you
would
let
them
and
may
think
it
your
fault
that
they
do
very
possible
said
hardy
i
tell
you
not
to
take
my
word
for
it
it
upsets
all
one
ideas
so
went
on
tom
why
oxford
ought
to
be
the
place
in
england
where
money
should
count
for
nothing
surely
now
such
a
man
as
jervis
our
captain
has
more
influence
than
all
the
rich
men
in
the
college
put
together
and
is
more
looked
up
to
he
one
of
a
thousand
said
hardy
handsome
strong
clever
and
up
to
everything
besides
he
is
a
poor
man
and
mind
i
do
say
that
if
he
were
he
would
be
where
he
is
i
am
speaking
of
the
rule
and
not
of
the
exceptions
here
hardy
scout
came
in
to
say
that
the
dean
wanted
to
speak
to
him
so
he
put
on
his
cap
and
gown
and
tom
rose
also
well
i
sorry
to
turn
you
out
said
hardy
and
i
afraid
i
been
very
surly
and
made
you
very
uncomfortable
you
come
back
again
in
a
hurry
indeed
i
will
though
if
you
will
let
me
said
tom
i
have
enjoyed
my
evening
immensely
then
come
whenever
you
like
said
hardy
but
i
am
afraid
of
interfering
with
your
reading
said
tom
oh
you
need
mind
that
i
have
plenty
of
time
on
my
hands
besides
one
ca
read
all
night
and
from
eight
till
ten
find
me
generally
idle
then
you
see
me
often
enough
but
promise
now
to
turn
me
out
whenever
i
am
in
the
way
very
well
said
hardy
laughing
and
so
they
parted
for
the
time
some
twenty
minutes
afterwards
hardy
returned
to
his
room
after
his
interview
with
the
dean
who
merely
wanted
to
speak
to
him
about
some
matter
of
college
business
he
flung
his
cap
and
gown
on
the
sofa
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
his
room
at
first
hurriedly
but
soon
with
his
usual
regular
tramp
however
expressive
a
man
face
may
be
and
however
well
you
may
know
it
it
is
simply
nonsense
to
say
that
you
can
tell
what
he
is
thinking
about
by
looking
at
it
as
many
of
us
are
apt
to
boast
still
more
absurd
would
it
be
to
expect
readers
to
know
what
hardy
is
thinking
about
when
they
have
never
had
the
advantage
of
seeing
his
face
even
in
a
photograph
wherefore
it
would
seem
that
the
author
is
bound
on
such
occasions
to
put
his
readers
on
equal
vantage
ground
with
himself
and
not
only
tell
what
a
man
does
but
so
far
as
may
be
what
he
is
thinking
about
also
his
first
thought
then
was
one
of
pleasure
at
having
been
sought
by
one
who
seemed
to
be
just
the
sort
of
friend
he
would
like
to
have
he
contrasted
our
hero
with
the
few
men
with
whom
he
had
generally
lived
and
for
some
of
whom
he
had
a
high
esteem
whose
only
idea
of
exercise
was
a
two
hour
constitutional
walk
in
the
afternoons
and
whose
life
was
chiefly
spent
over
books
and
behind
sported
oaks
and
felt
that
this
was
more
of
a
man
after
his
own
heart
then
came
doubts
whether
his
new
friend
would
draw
back
when
he
had
been
up
a
little
longer
and
knew
more
of
the
place
at
any
rate
he
had
said
and
done
nothing
to
tempt
him
if
he
pushes
the
acquaintance
and
i
think
he
will
it
will
be
because
he
likes
me
for
myself
and
i
can
do
him
good
too
i
feel
sure
he
went
on
as
he
ran
over
rapidly
his
own
life
for
the
last
three
years
perhaps
he
wo
flounder
into
all
the
sloughs
which
i
have
had
to
drag
through
he
will
get
too
much
of
the
healthy
active
life
up
here
for
that
which
i
have
never
had
but
some
of
them
he
must
get
into
all
the
companionship
of
boating
and
cricketing
and
and
supper
parties
and
all
the
reading
in
the
world
wo
keep
him
from
many
a
long
hour
of
mawkishness
and
discontent
and
emptiness
of
heart
he
feels
that
already
himself
am
i
sure
of
that
though
i
may
be
only
reading
myself
into
him
at
any
rate
why
should
i
have
helped
to
trouble
him
before
the
time
was
that
a
friend
part
well
he
face
it
and
the
sooner
the
better
perhaps
at
any
rate
it
is
done
but
what
a
blessed
thing
if
one
can
only
help
a
youngster
like
this
to
fight
his
own
way
through
the
cold
clammy
atmosphere
which
is
always
hanging
over
him
ready
to
settle
down
on
him
can
help
to
keep
some
living
faith
in
him
that
the
world
oxford
and
all
is
a
respectable
piece
of
machinery
set
going
some
centuries
back
ah
it
an
awful
business
that
temptation
to
believe
or
think
you
believe
in
a
dead
god
it
has
nearly
broken
my
back
a
score
of
times
what
are
all
the
temptations
of
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
to
this
it
includes
them
all
well
i
believe
i
can
help
him
and
please
god
i
will
if
he
will
only
let
me
and
the
very
sight
of
him
does
me
good
so
i
wo
believe
we
went
down
the
lasher
together
for
nothing
and
so
at
last
hardy
finished
his
walk
took
down
a
volume
of
don
quixote
from
his
shelves
and
sat
down
for
an
hour
enjoyment
before
turning
in
chapter
vi
how
drysdale
and
blake
went
fishing
drysdale
what
a
servitor
how
the
deuce
should
i
know
this
short
and
pithy
dialogue
took
place
in
drysdale
rooms
one
evening
soon
after
the
conversation
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
he
and
tom
were
sitting
alone
there
for
a
wonder
and
so
the
latter
seized
the
occasion
to
propound
this
question
which
he
had
had
on
his
mind
for
some
time
he
was
scarcely
satisfied
with
the
above
rejoinder
but
while
he
was
thinking
how
to
come
at
the
subject
by
another
road
drysdale
opened
a
morocco
and
poured
its
contents
on
the
table
which
was
already
covered
with
flies
of
all
sorts
and
patterns
hanks
of
gut
delicate
casts
reels
minnows
and
tackle
enough
to
kill
all
the
fish
in
the
four
neighboring
counties
tom
began
turning
them
over
and
scrutinizing
the
dressings
of
the
flies
it
has
been
so
mild
the
fish
must
be
in
season
do
you
think
besides
if
they
not
it
a
jolly
drive
to
fairford
at
any
rate
you
never
been
behind
my
team
brown
you
better
come
now
i
ca
cut
my
two
lectures
bother
your
lectures
put
on
an
aeger
then
no
that
does
suit
my
book
you
know
i
ca
see
why
you
should
be
so
cursedly
particular
well
if
you
wo
you
wo
i
know
that
well
enough
but
what
cast
shall
you
fish
with
how
many
flies
do
you
use
sometimes
two
sometimes
three
two
enough
i
think
all
depends
on
the
weather
but
if
at
all
like
today
you
ca
do
better
i
should
think
than
the
old
march
brown
and
a
palmer
to
begin
with
then
for
change
this
hare
ear
and
an
alder
fly
perhaps
or
let
me
see
and
he
began
searching
the
glittering
heap
to
select
a
color
to
go
with
the
dull
hare
ear
is
it
early
for
the
alder
said
drysdale
rather
perhaps
but
they
ca
resist
it
these
little
sinners
any
good
said
drysdale
throwing
some
across
the
table
yes
i
never
like
to
be
without
them
and
a
governor
or
two
here
this
is
a
lot
said
tom
picking
out
half
you
never
know
when
you
may
not
kill
with
either
of
them
but
i
do
know
the
fairford
water
so
my
opinion
worth
much
tom
soon
returned
to
the
old
topic
but
now
drysdale
you
must
know
what
a
servitor
is
why
should
i
do
you
mean
one
of
our
college
servitors
yes
oh
something
in
the
line
i
should
put
him
above
the
porter
and
below
the
cook
and
butler
he
does
the
dirty
work
and
gets
their
broken
victuals
and
i
believe
he
pays
no
college
fees
tom
rather
drew
into
himself
at
this
insolent
and
offhand
definition
he
was
astonished
and
hurt
at
the
tone
of
his
friend
however
presently
he
resolved
to
go
through
with
it
and
began
again
but
servitors
are
gentlemen
i
suppose
a
good
deal
of
the
about
them
i
should
think
but
i
have
not
the
honor
of
any
acquaintance
amongst
them
at
any
rate
they
are
undergraduates
are
not
they
yes
and
may
take
degrees
just
like
you
or
me
they
may
have
all
the
degrees
to
themselves
for
anything
i
care
i
wish
they
would
let
one
pay
a
servitor
for
passing
for
one
it
would
be
deuced
comfortable
i
wonder
it
do
strike
the
dons
now
they
might
get
clever
beggars
for
servitors
and
farm
them
and
so
make
loads
of
tin
but
drysdale
seriously
why
should
you
talk
like
that
if
they
can
take
all
the
degrees
we
can
and
are
in
fact
just
what
we
are
undergraduates
i
ca
see
why
they
not
as
likely
to
be
gentlemen
as
we
it
can
surely
make
no
difference
their
being
poor
men
it
must
make
them
devilish
uncomfortable
said
the
incorrigible
payer
of
double
fees
getting
up
to
light
his
cigar
the
name
ought
to
carry
respect
here
at
any
rate
the
black
prince
was
an
oxford
man
and
he
thought
the
noblest
motto
he
could
take
was
dien
i
serve
if
he
were
here
now
he
would
change
it
for
paye
i
often
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
really
and
truly
think
drysdale
my
dear
fellow
i
am
telling
you
what
i
do
really
think
whatever
the
black
prince
might
be
pleased
to
observe
if
he
were
here
i
stick
to
my
motto
i
tell
you
the
thing
to
be
able
to
do
here
at
oxford
is
to
pay
i
do
believe
it
i
knew
you
would
i
do
believe
you
do
either
i
do
though
but
what
makes
you
so
curious
about
servitors
why
i
made
friends
with
hardy
one
of
our
servitors
he
is
such
a
fine
fellow
i
am
sorry
to
relate
that
it
cost
tom
an
effort
to
say
this
to
drysdale
but
he
despised
himself
that
it
was
so
you
should
have
told
me
so
before
you
began
to
pump
me
said
drysdale
however
i
partly
suspected
something
of
the
sort
you
a
good
bit
of
a
quixote
in
you
but
really
brown
he
added
seeing
tom
redden
and
look
angry
i
sorry
if
what
i
said
pained
you
i
daresay
this
friend
of
yours
is
a
gentleman
and
all
you
say
he
is
more
of
a
gentleman
by
a
long
way
than
most
of
gentlemen
commoners
you
were
going
to
say
do
crane
at
such
a
small
fence
on
my
account
i
will
put
it
in
another
way
for
you
he
ca
be
a
greater
snob
than
many
of
them
well
but
why
do
you
live
with
them
so
much
then
why
because
they
happen
to
do
the
things
i
like
doing
and
live
up
here
as
i
like
to
live
i
like
hunting
and
driving
and
drawing
badgers
and
playing
cards
and
good
wine
and
cigars
they
hunt
and
drive
and
keep
dogs
and
good
cellars
and
will
play
unlimited
loo
or
van
john
as
long
as
i
please
but
i
know
you
get
very
sick
of
all
that
often
for
i
heard
you
say
as
much
times
in
the
little
time
i
been
here
why
you
do
want
to
deny
me
the
briton
privilege
of
grumbling
do
you
said
drysdale
as
he
flung
his
legs
up
on
the
sofa
crossing
one
over
the
other
as
he
lounged
on
his
back
his
favorite
attitude
but
suppose
i
am
getting
tired
of
it
all
which
i
am
not
what
do
you
purpose
as
a
substitute
take
to
boating
i
know
you
could
be
in
the
first
boat
if
you
liked
i
heard
them
say
so
at
smith
wine
the
other
night
but
what
to
prevent
my
getting
just
as
tired
of
that
besides
it
such
a
grind
and
then
there
the
bore
of
changing
all
one
habits
yes
but
it
such
splendid
hard
work
said
tom
who
was
bent
on
making
a
convert
of
his
friend
just
so
and
that
just
what
i
do
want
the
and
work
and
healthful
play
line
do
suit
my
complaint
no
as
my
uncle
says
young
fellow
must
sow
his
wild
oats
and
oxford
seems
a
place
especially
set
apart
by
providence
for
that
operation
in
all
the
wild
range
of
accepted
british
maxims
there
is
none
take
it
for
all
in
all
more
thoroughly
abominable
than
this
one
as
to
the
sowing
of
wild
oats
look
at
it
on
what
side
you
will
and
you
can
make
nothing
but
a
devil
maxim
of
it
what
a
man
be
he
young
old
or
sows
and
nothing
else
shall
he
reap
the
one
only
thing
to
do
with
wild
oats
is
to
put
them
carefully
into
the
hottest
part
of
the
fire
and
get
them
burnt
to
dust
every
seed
of
them
if
you
sow
them
no
matter
in
what
ground
up
they
will
come
with
long
tough
roots
like
couch
grass
and
luxuriant
stalks
and
leaves
as
sure
as
there
is
a
sun
in
heaven
a
crop
which
it
turns
one
heart
cold
to
think
of
the
devil
too
whose
special
crop
they
are
will
see
that
they
thrive
and
you
and
nobody
else
will
have
to
reap
them
and
no
common
reaping
will
get
them
out
of
the
soil
which
must
be
dug
down
deep
again
and
again
well
for
you
if
with
all
your
care
you
can
make
the
ground
sweet
again
by
your
dying
day
boys
will
be
boys
is
not
much
better
but
that
has
a
true
side
to
it
but
this
encouragement
to
the
sowing
of
wild
oats
is
simply
devilish
for
it
means
that
a
young
man
is
to
give
way
to
the
temptations
and
follow
the
lusts
of
his
age
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
wild
oats
of
manhood
and
old
age
with
ambition
the
false
weights
hardness
suspicion
avarice
if
the
wild
oats
of
youth
are
to
be
sown
and
not
burnt
what
possible
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
them
if
we
may
sow
the
one
why
not
the
other
but
to
get
back
to
our
story
tom
went
away
from
drysdale
rooms
that
night
after
they
had
sorted
all
the
tackle
which
was
to
accompany
the
fishing
expedition
to
their
satisfaction
in
a
disturbed
state
of
mind
he
was
very
much
annoyed
at
way
of
talking
because
he
was
getting
to
like
the
man
he
was
surprised
and
angry
at
being
driven
more
and
more
to
the
conclusion
that
the
worship
of
the
golden
calf
was
verily
and
indeed
rampant
in
oxford
side
by
side
no
doubt
with
much
that
was
manly
and
noble
but
tainting
more
or
less
the
whole
life
of
the
place
in
fact
what
annoyed
him
most
was
the
consciousness
that
he
himself
was
becoming
an
idolater
for
he
could
help
admitting
that
he
felt
much
more
comfortable
when
standing
in
the
quadrangles
or
strolling
in
the
high
street
with
drysdale
in
his
velvet
cap
and
silk
gown
and
faultless
than
when
doing
the
same
things
with
hardy
in
his
faded
old
gown
shabby
loose
overcoat
and
trousers
he
would
have
had
hardy
suspect
the
fact
for
all
he
was
worth
and
hoped
to
get
over
the
feeling
soon
but
there
it
was
unmistakably
he
wondered
whether
hardy
had
ever
felt
anything
of
the
kind
himself
nevertheless
these
thoughts
did
not
hinder
him
from
sleeping
soundly
or
from
getting
up
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
to
go
and
see
drysdale
start
on
his
expedition
accordingly
he
was
in
drysdale
rooms
next
morning
betimes
and
assisted
at
the
early
breakfast
which
was
going
on
there
blake
was
the
only
other
man
present
he
was
going
with
drysdale
and
entrusted
tom
with
a
message
to
miller
and
the
captain
that
he
could
not
pull
in
the
boat
that
day
but
would
pay
a
waterman
to
take
his
place
as
soon
as
the
gate
opened
the
three
accompanied
by
the
faithful
jack
and
followed
by
scout
bearing
overcoats
a
splendid
apron
lined
with
fur
and
the
rods
and
reels
sallied
out
of
the
college
and
sought
the
livery
stables
patronized
by
the
men
of
ambrose
here
they
found
a
dog
cart
all
ready
in
the
yard
with
a
strong
horse
in
the
shafts
called
satan
by
drysdale
the
leader
had
been
sent
on
to
the
first
turnpike
the
things
were
packed
and
jack
the
hoisted
into
the
interior
in
a
few
minutes
drysdale
produced
a
long
straight
horn
which
he
called
his
yard
of
tin
probably
because
it
was
made
of
brass
and
after
refreshing
himself
with
a
blast
or
two
handed
it
over
to
blake
and
then
mounted
the
dog
cart
and
took
the
reins
blake
seated
himself
by
his
side
the
help
who
was
to
accompany
them
got
up
behind
and
jack
looked
wisely
out
from
his
inside
place
over
the
are
we
all
right
said
drysdale
catching
his
long
tandem
whip
into
a
knowing
double
thong
all
right
sir
said
the
head
ostler
touching
his
cap
you
better
have
come
my
boy
said
drysdale
to
tom
as
they
trotted
off
out
of
the
yard
and
tom
could
help
envying
them
as
he
followed
and
watched
the
dog
cart
lessening
rapidly
down
the
empty
street
and
heard
the
notes
of
the
yard
of
tin
which
blake
managed
to
make
really
musical
borne
back
on
the
soft
western
breeze
it
was
such
a
pleasant
morning
for
fishing
however
it
was
too
late
to
repent
had
he
wished
it
and
so
he
got
back
to
chapel
and
destroyed
the
whole
effect
of
the
morning
service
on
miller
mind
by
delivering
blake
message
to
that
choleric
coxswain
as
soon
as
chapel
was
over
miller
vowed
for
the
twentieth
time
that
blake
should
be
turned
out
of
the
boat
and
went
off
to
the
captain
rooms
to
torment
him
and
consult
what
was
to
be
done
the
weather
continued
magnificent
a
soft
dull
grey
march
day
and
a
steady
wind
and
the
thought
of
the
lucky
fishermen
and
visions
of
creels
filled
with
huge
haunted
tom
at
lecture
and
throughout
the
day
at
two
he
was
down
at
the
river
the
college
eight
was
to
go
down
for
the
first
time
in
the
season
to
the
reached
below
nuneham
for
a
good
training
pull
and
he
had
notice
to
his
great
joy
that
he
was
to
be
tried
in
the
boat
but
great
no
doubt
as
was
the
glory
the
price
was
a
heavy
one
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
subjected
to
the
tender
mercies
of
miller
the
coxswain
or
had
pulled
behind
the
captain
and
it
did
not
take
long
to
convince
him
that
it
was
a
very
different
style
of
thing
from
anything
he
had
as
yet
been
accustomed
to
in
the
freshman
crew
the
long
steady
sweep
of
the
paddle
tried
him
almost
as
much
as
the
breathless
strain
of
the
spurt
miller
too
was
in
one
of
his
most
relentless
moods
he
was
angry
at
blake
desertion
and
seemed
to
think
that
tom
had
something
to
do
with
it
though
he
simply
delivered
the
message
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
and
so
though
he
distributed
rebuke
and
objurgation
to
every
man
in
the
boat
except
the
captain
he
seemed
to
our
hero
to
take
particular
delight
in
working
him
there
he
stood
in
the
stern
the
fiery
little
coxswain
leaning
forward
with
a
in
each
hand
and
bending
to
every
stroke
shouting
his
warnings
and
rebukes
and
monitions
to
tom
till
he
drove
him
to
his
wits
end
by
the
time
the
boat
came
back
to
hall
his
arms
were
so
numb
that
he
could
hardly
tell
whether
his
oar
was
in
or
out
of
his
hand
his
legs
were
stiff
and
aching
and
every
muscle
in
his
body
felt
as
if
it
had
been
pulled
out
an
inch
or
two
as
he
walked
up
to
college
he
felt
as
if
his
shoulders
and
legs
had
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
in
short
he
had
had
a
very
hard
day
work
and
after
going
fast
asleep
at
a
and
trying
in
vain
to
rouse
himself
by
a
stroll
in
the
streets
fairly
gave
in
about
ten
and
went
to
bed
without
remembering
to
sport
his
oak
for
some
hours
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
dead
but
at
last
began
to
be
conscious
of
voices
and
the
clicking
of
glasses
and
laughter
and
scraps
of
songs
and
after
turning
himself
once
or
twice
in
bed
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
awake
or
no
rubbed
his
eyes
sat
up
and
became
aware
that
something
very
entertaining
to
the
parties
concerned
was
going
on
in
his
after
listening
for
a
minute
he
jumped
up
threw
on
his
and
appeared
at
the
door
of
his
own
where
he
paused
a
moment
to
contemplate
the
scene
which
met
his
astonished
vision
his
fire
recently
replenished
was
burning
brightly
in
the
grate
and
his
candles
on
the
table
on
which
stood
his
whisky
bottle
and
tumblers
and
hot
water
on
his
sofa
which
had
been
wheeled
round
before
the
fire
reclined
drysdale
on
his
back
in
his
pet
attitude
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
from
which
he
was
singing
and
in
the
sat
blake
while
jack
was
coiled
on
the
rug
turning
himself
every
now
and
then
in
a
sort
of
uneasy
protest
against
his
untimely
hilarity
at
first
tom
felt
inclined
to
be
angry
but
the
jolly
shout
of
laughter
with
which
drysdale
received
him
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
light
in
and
dishevelled
hair
appeased
him
at
once
why
brown
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
been
in
bed
this
last
we
looked
into
the
and
thought
it
was
empty
sit
down
old
fellow
and
make
yourself
at
home
have
a
glass
of
grog
it
whisky
well
you
a
couple
of
cool
hands
i
must
say
said
tom
how
did
you
get
in
through
the
door
like
honest
men
said
drysdale
you
the
only
good
fellow
in
college
when
we
got
back
our
fires
were
out
and
we
been
all
round
the
college
and
found
all
the
oaks
sported
but
yours
never
sport
your
oak
old
boy
it
a
bad
habit
you
do
know
what
time
in
the
morning
you
may
entertain
angels
unawares
you
a
rum
pair
of
angels
anyhow
said
tom
taking
his
seat
on
the
sofa
but
what
is
it
oh
about
one
said
drysdale
we
had
a
series
of
catastrophes
never
got
into
college
till
near
one
i
thought
we
should
never
have
waked
that
besotted
little
porter
however
here
we
are
at
last
you
see
all
right
so
it
seems
said
tom
but
how
about
the
fishing
fishing
we
never
thrown
a
fly
all
day
said
drysdale
he
is
so
cursedly
conceited
about
his
knowledge
of
the
country
struck
in
blake
what
with
that
and
his
awful
twist
and
his
incurable
habit
of
gossiping
and
his
blackguard
dog
and
his
team
of
a
devil
and
a
young
female
hold
your
scandalous
tongue
shouted
drysdale
to
hear
talking
of
my
twist
indeed
you
ate
four
chops
and
a
whole
chicken
at
dinner
to
your
own
cheek
you
know
that
quite
another
thing
said
blake
i
like
to
see
a
fellow
an
honest
grubber
at
breakfast
and
dinner
but
you
always
got
your
nose
in
the
manger
that
how
we
all
got
wrong
brown
you
saw
what
a
breakfast
he
ate
before
starting
well
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
another
at
whitney
there
we
fell
in
with
a
bird
in
mahogany
tops
and
as
usual
drysdale
began
chumming
with
him
he
knew
all
about
the
fishing
of
the
next
three
counties
i
daresay
he
did
my
private
belief
is
that
he
is
one
of
the
hungerford
town
council
who
let
the
fishing
there
at
any
rate
he
swore
it
was
no
use
our
going
to
fairford
the
only
place
where
fish
would
be
in
season
was
hungerford
of
course
drysdale
swallowed
it
all
and
nothing
would
serve
him
but
that
we
should
turn
off
for
hungerford
at
once
now
i
did
go
once
to
hungerford
races
and
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
we
should
never
get
near
the
place
not
a
bit
of
use
he
knew
every
foot
of
the
country
it
was
then
about
nine
he
would
guarantee
that
we
should
be
there
by
twelve
at
latest
so
we
should
have
been
but
for
accidents
struck
in
drysdale
well
at
any
rate
what
we
did
was
to
drive
into
farringdon
instead
of
hungerford
both
horses
dead
done
up
at
twelve
after
missing
our
way
about
twenty
times
because
you
would
put
in
your
oar
said
drysdale
then
grub
again
went
on
blake
and
an
hour
to
bait
the
horses
i
knew
we
were
as
likely
to
get
to
jericho
as
to
hungerford
however
he
would
start
but
luckily
about
two
miles
from
farringdon
old
satan
bowled
quietly
into
a
bank
broke
a
shaft
and
deposited
us
then
and
there
he
was
such
a
fool
as
to
be
going
to
hungerford
at
that
time
of
day
the
first
time
in
his
wicked
old
life
that
i
ever
remember
seeing
him
do
anything
that
pleased
me
come
now
said
drysdale
do
you
mean
to
say
you
ever
sat
behind
a
better
wheeler
when
he
in
a
decent
temper
ca
say
said
blake
never
sat
behind
him
in
a
good
temper
that
i
can
remember
i
trot
him
five
miles
out
and
home
in
a
on
any
road
out
of
oxford
against
any
horse
you
can
bring
for
a
fiver
done
said
blake
but
were
you
upset
said
tom
how
did
you
get
into
the
bank
why
you
see
said
drysdale
jessy
that
the
little
my
leader
is
very
young
and
as
shy
and
skittish
as
the
rest
of
her
sex
we
turned
a
corner
sharp
and
came
right
upon
a
gipsy
encampment
up
she
went
into
the
air
in
a
moment
and
then
turned
right
around
and
came
head
on
at
the
cart
i
gave
her
the
double
thong
across
her
face
to
send
her
back
again
and
satan
seizing
the
opportunity
rushed
against
the
bank
dragging
her
with
him
and
snapping
the
shaft
and
so
ended
our
day
fishing
said
blake
and
next
moment
out
jumps
that
brute
jack
and
pitches
into
the
gipsy
dog
who
had
come
up
very
naturally
to
have
a
look
at
what
was
going
on
down
jumps
drysdale
to
see
that
his
beast
gets
fair
play
leaving
me
and
the
help
to
look
after
the
wreck
and
keep
his
precious
wheeler
from
kicking
the
cart
into
little
pieces
come
now
said
drysdale
you
must
own
we
fell
on
our
legs
after
all
had
we
a
jolly
afternoon
i
thinking
of
turning
tramp
brown
we
spent
three
or
four
hours
in
that
camp
and
blake
got
spooney
on
a
gipsy
girl
and
has
written
i
do
know
how
many
songs
on
them
did
you
hear
us
singing
them
just
now
but
how
did
you
get
the
cart
mended
said
tom
oh
the
tinker
patched
up
the
shaft
for
us
a
cunning
old
beggar
the
de
of
the
encampment
up
to
every
move
on
the
board
he
wanted
to
have
a
deal
with
me
for
jessy
but
my
honor
we
had
a
good
time
of
it
there
was
the
old
tinker
mending
the
shaft
in
his
fur
cap
with
a
black
pipe
one
inch
long
sticking
out
of
his
mouth
and
the
old
brown
parchment
of
a
mother
with
her
head
in
a
red
handkerchief
smoking
a
ditto
pipe
to
the
tinker
who
told
our
fortunes
and
talked
like
a
printed
book
then
there
was
his
wife
and
the
slip
of
a
girl
who
bowled
over
blake
there
and
half
a
dozen
ragged
brats
and
a
fellow
on
a
tramp
not
a
gipsy
some
runaway
apprentice
i
take
it
but
a
jolly
dog
with
no
luggage
but
an
old
fiddle
on
which
he
scraped
away
uncommonly
well
and
set
blake
making
rhymes
as
we
sat
in
the
tent
you
never
heard
any
of
his
songs
here
one
for
each
of
us
we
going
to
get
up
the
characters
and
sing
them
about
the
country
now
for
a
rehearsal
i
be
the
tinker
no
you
must
take
the
servant
girl
said
blake
well
we
toss
up
for
characters
when
the
time
comes
you
begin
then
here
a
song
and
he
handed
one
of
the
papers
to
blake
who
began
singing
squat
on
a
green
plot
we
scorn
a
bench
or
settle
oh
plying
or
trying
a
spice
of
every
trade
razors
we
grind
ring
a
pig
or
mend
a
kettle
oh
come
what
d
lack
speak
it
out
my
pretty
maid
i
set
your
scissors
while
my
granny
tells
you
plainly
who
stole
your
barley
meal
your
butter
or
your
heart
tell
if
your
husband
will
be
handsome
or

i

said
tom
it
he
a
good
lark
though
now
you
have
told
me
how
you
got
home
oh
we
left
camp
at
about
the
tinker
having
extracted
a
sovereign
from
drysdale
interrupted
blake
what
did
you
give
to
the
little
gypsy
yourself
retorted
drysdale
i
saw
your
adieus
under
the
well
we
got
on
all
right
to
old
murdock
at
kingston
inn
by
about
seven
and
there
we
had
dinner
and
after
dinner
the
old
boy
came
in
he
and
i
are
great
chums
for
i
often
there
and
always
ask
him
in
but
that
beggar
blake
who
never
saw
him
before
cut
me
clean
out
in
five
minutes
fancy
his
swearing
he
is
scotch
and
that
an
ancestor
of
his
in
the
sixteenth
century
married
a
murdock
well
when
you
come
to
think
what
a
lot
of
ancestors
one
must
have
had
at
that
time
it
probably
true
said
blake
at
any
rate
it
took
went
on
drysdale
i
thought
old
murdock
would
have
wept
on
his
neck
as
it
was
he
scattered
snuff
enough
to
fill
a
pint
pot
over
him
out
of
his
mull
and
began
talking
gaelic
and
blake
had
the
cheek
to
jabber
a
lot
of
gibberish
back
to
him
as
if
he
understood
every
word
gibberish
it
was
the
purest
gaelic
said
blake
laughing
i
heard
a
lot
of
greek
words
myself
said
drysdale
but
old
murdock
was
too
pleased
at
hearing
his
own
clapper
going
and
too
full
of
whisky
to
find
him
out
let
alone
that
i
doubt
whether
he
remembers
more
than
about
five
words
of
his
native
tongue
himself
said
blake
the
old
boy
got
so
excited
that
he
went
up
stairs
for
his
plaid
and
dirk
and
dressed
himself
up
in
them
apologising
that
he
could
not
appear
in
the
full
grab
of
old
gaul
in
honor
of
his
relative
as
his
daughter
had
cut
up
his
old
kilt
for
for
the
barnies
during
his
absence
from
home
then
they
took
to
more
toddy
and
singing
scotch
songs
till
at
eleven
they
were
standing
on
their
chairs
right
hands
clasped
each
with
one
foot
on
the
table
glasses
in
the
other
hands
the
toddy
flying
over
the
room
as
they
swayed
about
roaring
like
maniacs
what
was
it
oh
i
have
it
all
agree
he
has
told
you
that
he
tried
to
join
us
and
tumbled
over
the
back
of
his
chair
into
the
basket
a
libel
a
libel
shouted
drysdale
the
leg
of
my
chair
broke
and
i
stepped
down
gracefully
and
safely
and
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
what
a
tottery
performance
it
was
i
concluded
to
give
them
a
wide
berth
it
would
be
no
joke
to
have
old
murdock
topple
over
on
to
you
i
left
them
and
went
out
to
look
after
the
trap
which
was
ordered
to
be
at
the
door
at
ten
i
found
murdock
ostler
very
drunk
but
sober
compared
with
that
rascally
help
whom
we
had
been
fools
enough
to
take
with
us
they
had
got
the
trap
out
and
the
horses
in
but
that
old
rascal
satan
was
standing
so
quiet
that
i
suspected
something
wrong
sure
enough
when
i
came
to
look
they
had
him
up
to
the
cheek
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
and
third
bar
on
the
other
his
buckled
across
his
back
and
no
kicking
strap
the
old
brute
was
chuckling
to
himself
what
he
would
do
with
us
as
soon
as
we
had
started
in
that
trim
it
took
half
an
hour
getting
all
right
as
i
was
the
only
one
able
to
do
anything
yes
you
would
have
said
so
said
blake
if
you
had
seen
him
trying
to
put
jack
up
behind
he
made
six
shots
with
the
old
dog
and
dropped
him
about
on
his
head
and
the
broad
of
his
back
as
if
he
had
been
a
bundle
of
ells
the
fact
is
that
that
rascally
ostler
had
made
poor
old
jack
drunk
too
explained
drysdale
and
he
would
be
lifted
straight
however
we
got
off
at
last
and
had
gone
a
mile
before
the
help
who
was
maundering
away
some
cursed
sentimental
ditty
or
other
behind
lurched
more
heavily
than
usual
and
pitched
off
into
the
night
somewhere
blake
looked
for
him
for
and
could
find
a
hair
you
do
mean
to
say
the
man
tumbled
off
and
you
never
found
him
said
tom
in
horror
well
that
about
the
fact
said
drysdale
but
it
is
so
bad
as
you
think
we
had
no
lamps
and
it
was
an
uncommon
bad
night
for
running
by
holloas
but
a
night
for
running
by
scent
broke
in
blake
the
fellow
leant
against
me
until
he
made
his
exit
and
i
have
backed
myself
to
have
hit
the
scent
again
off
if
the
wind
had
only
been
right
he
may
have
broken
his
neck
said
tom
can
a
fellow
sing
with
a
broken
neck
said
drysdale
hanged
if
i
know
but
do
i
tell
you
we
heard
him
maundering
on
somewhere
or
other
and
when
blake
shouted
he
rebuked
him
piously
out
of
the
pitch
darkness
and
told
him
to
go
home
and
repent
i
nearly
dropped
off
the
box
laughing
at
them
and
then
he
his
testimony
as
he
called
it
against
me
for
driving
a
horse
called
satan
i
believe
he
a
ranting
methodist
spouter
i
tried
hard
to
find
him
said
blake
for
i
should
dearly
have
liked
to
kick
him
safely
into
the
ditch
at
last
black
will
himself
could
have
held
satan
another
minute
so
blake
scrambled
up
and
away
we
came
and
knocked
into
college
at
one
for
a
finish
the
rest
you
know
well
you
had
a
pretty
good
day
of
it
said
tom
who
had
been
hugely
amused
but
i
should
feel
nervous
about
the
help
if
i
were
you
oh
he
come
to
no
grief
i
be
bound
said
drysdale
but
what
is
it
three
said
blake
looking
at
his
watch
and
getting
up
time
to
turn
in
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
you
say
that
said
drysdale
yes
but
you
forget
we
were
up
this
morning
before
the
world
was
aired
good
night
brown
and
off
the
two
went
leaving
tom
to
sport
his
oak
this
time
and
retire
in
wonder
to
bed
drysdale
was
asleep
with
jack
curled
up
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
in
ten
minutes
blake
by
the
help
of
wet
towels
and
a
knotted
piece
of
whipcord
round
his
forehead
read
pinder
till
the
chapel
bell
began
to
ring
chapter
vii
an
explosion
our
hero
soon
began
to
feel
that
he
was
contracting
his
first
college
friendship
the
great
strong
servitor
who
seemed
almost
at
the
same
time
utterly
reckless
of
and
nervously
alive
to
the
opinion
of
all
around
him
with
his
bursts
of
womanly
tenderness
and
berserker
rage
alternating
like
storms
and
sunshine
of
a
july
day
on
a
high
moorland
his
keen
sense
of
humor
and
appreciation
of
all
the
good
things
of
life
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
which
he
was
so
steadily
denying
himself
from
high
principle
had
from
the
first
seized
powerfully
on
all
tom
sympathies
and
was
daily
gaining
more
hold
upon
him
blessed
is
the
man
who
has
the
gift
of
making
friends
for
it
is
one
of
god
best
gifts
it
involves
many
things
but
above
all
the
power
of
going
out
of
oneself
and
seeing
and
appreciating
whatever
is
noble
and
living
in
another
man
but
even
to
him
who
has
the
gift
it
is
often
a
great
puzzle
to
find
out
whether
a
man
is
really
a
friend
or
not
the
following
is
recommended
as
a
test
in
the
case
of
any
man
about
whom
you
are
not
quite
sure
especially
if
he
should
happen
to
have
more
of
this
world
goods
either
in
the
shape
of
talents
rank
or
money
or
what
not
than
you
fancy
the
man
stripped
stark
naked
of
every
thing
in
the
world
except
an
old
pair
of
trousers
and
a
shirt
for
decency
sake
without
even
a
name
to
him
and
dropped
down
in
the
middle
of
holborn
or
piccadilly
would
you
go
up
to
him
then
and
there
and
lead
him
out
from
amongst
the
cabs
and
omnibuses
and
take
him
to
your
own
home
and
feed
him
and
clothe
him
and
stand
by
him
against
all
the
world
to
your
last
sovereign
and
your
last
leg
of
mutton
if
you
would
do
this
you
have
no
right
to
call
him
by
the
sacred
name
of
friend
if
you
would
the
odds
are
that
he
would
do
the
same
by
you
and
you
may
count
yourself
a
rich
man
for
probably
were
friendship
expressible
by
or
convertible
into
current
coin
of
the
realm
one
such
friend
would
be
worth
to
a
man
at
least
how
many
millionaires
are
there
in
england
i
ca
even
guess
but
more
by
a
good
many
i
fear
than
there
are
men
who
have
ten
real
friends
but
friendship
is
not
expressible
or
convertible
it
is
more
precious
than
wisdom
and
wisdom
can
not
be
gotten
for
gold
nor
shall
rubies
be
mentioned
in
comparison
thereof
not
all
the
riches
that
ever
came
out
of
earth
and
sea
are
worth
the
assurance
of
one
such
real
abiding
friendship
in
your
heart
of
hearts
but
for
the
worth
of
a
friendship
commonly
so
called
meaning
thereby
a
sentiment
founded
on
the
good
dinners
good
stories
opera
stalls
and
days
hooting
you
have
gotten
or
hope
to
get
out
of
a
man
the
snug
things
in
his
gift
and
his
powers
of
procuring
enjoyment
of
one
kind
or
another
to
miserable
body
or
intellect
why
such
a
friendship
as
that
is
to
be
appraised
easily
enough
if
you
find
it
worth
your
while
but
you
will
have
to
pay
your
pound
of
flesh
for
it
one
way
or
another
you
may
take
your
oath
of
that
if
you
follow
my
advice
you
will
take
a
note
down
and
retire
to
your
crust
of
bread
and
liberty
tom
was
rapidly
falling
into
friendship
with
hardy
he
was
not
bound
hand
and
foot
and
carried
away
captive
yet
but
he
was
already
getting
deep
in
the
toils
one
evening
he
found
himself
as
usual
at
hardy
door
about
eight
the
oak
was
open
but
he
got
no
answer
when
he
knocked
at
the
inner
door
nevertheless
he
entered
having
quite
got
over
all
shyness
or
ceremony
by
this
time
the
room
was
empty
but
two
tumblers
and
the
black
bottle
stood
on
the
table
and
the
kettle
was
hissing
away
on
the
hob
ah
thought
tom
he
expects
me
i
see
so
he
turned
his
back
to
the
fire
and
made
himself
at
home
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
and
still
hardy
did
not
return
never
knew
him
out
so
long
before
at
this
time
of
night
thought
tom
perhaps
he
at
some
party
i
hope
so
it
would
do
him
a
good
deal
of
good
and
i
know
he
might
go
out
if
he
liked
next
term
see
if
i
wo
make
him
more
sociable
it
a
stupid
custom
that
freshmen
do
give
parties
in
their
first
term
or
i
do
it
at
once
why
wo
he
be
more
sociable
no
after
all
sociable
is
the
word
he
a
very
sociable
fellow
at
bottom
what
in
the
world
is
it
that
he
wants
and
so
tom
balanced
himself
on
the
two
hind
legs
of
one
of
the
windsor
chairs
and
betook
himself
to
pondering
what
it
was
exactly
which
ought
to
be
added
to
hardy
to
make
him
an
unexceptional
object
of
when
the
man
himself
came
suddenly
into
the
room
slamming
his
oak
behind
him
and
casting
his
cap
and
gown
fiercely
on
to
the
sofa
before
he
noticed
our
hero
tom
jumped
up
at
once
my
dear
fellow
what
the
matter
he
said
i
sorry
i
came
in
shall
i
go
no
do
go
sit
down
said
hardy
abruptly
and
then
began
to
smoke
fast
without
saying
another
word
tom
waited
a
few
minutes
watching
for
him
and
then
broke
silence
i
am
sure
something
is
the
matter
hardy
you
look
dreadfully
put
out
what
is
it
what
is
it
said
hardy
bitterly
oh
nothing
at
all
nothing
at
all
a
gentle
lesson
to
servitors
as
to
the
duties
of
their
position
not
pleasant
perhaps
for
a
youngster
to
swallow
but
i
ought
to
be
used
to
such
things
at
any
rate
by
this
time
i
beg
your
pardon
for
seeming
put
out
do
tell
me
what
it
is
said
tom
i
sure
i
am
very
sorry
for
anything
which
annoys
you
i
believe
you
are
said
hardy
looking
at
him
and
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
fellow
offering
smith
the
junior
servitor
a
boy
just
come
up
a
bribe
of
ten
pounds
to
prick
him
in
at
chapel
when
he
is
there
the
dirty
blackguard
said
tom
by
jove
he
ought
to
be
cut
he
will
be
cut
wo
he
you
do
mean
that
he
really
did
offer
him
the
money
i
do
said
hardy
and
the
poor
little
fellow
came
here
after
hall
to
ask
me
what
he
should
do
with
tears
in
his
eyes
chanter
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
in
quad
said
tom
i
will
go
and
call
on
smith
directly
what
did
you
do
why
as
soon
as
i
could
master
myself
enough
not
to
lay
hands
on
him
said
hardy
i
went
across
to
his
rooms
where
he
was
entertaining
a
select
party
and
just
gave
him
his
choice
between
writing
an
abject
apology
then
and
there
to
my
dictation
or
having
the
whole
business
laid
before
the
principal
morning
he
chose
the
former
alternative
and
i
made
him
write
such
a
letter
as
i
do
think
he
will
forget
in
a
hurry
that
good
said
tom
but
he
ought
to
have
been
horsewhipped
too
it
makes
one
fingers
itch
to
think
of
it
however
all
right
now
all
right
said
hardy
bitterly
i
do
know
what
you
call
right
probably
the
boy
is
hurt
for
life
you
ca
salve
over
this
sort
of
thing
with
an
well
i
hope
it
is
so
bad
as
that
said
tom
wait
till
you
tried
it
yourself
said
hardy
i
tell
you
what
it
is
one
or
two
things
of
this
sort
and
i
seen
many
more
than
that
in
my
time
sink
down
into
you
and
leave
marks
like
a
iron
but
hardy
now
really
did
you
ever
know
a
bribe
offered
before
said
tom
hardy
thought
for
a
moment
no
said
he
i
ca
say
that
i
have
but
things
as
bad
or
nearly
as
bad
often
he
paused
a
minute
and
then
went
on
i
tell
you
if
it
were
not
for
my
dear
old
father
who
would
break
his
heart
over
it
i
would
cut
the
whole
concern
i
been
near
doing
it
twenty
times
and
enlisting
in
a
good
regiment
would
it
be
any
better
there
though
said
tom
gently
for
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
gunpowder
magazine
better
yes
it
must
be
better
said
hardy
at
any
rate
the
youngsters
there
are
marchers
and
fighters
besides
one
would
be
in
the
ranks
and
know
one
place
here
one
is
by
way
of
being
a
gentleman
god
save
the
mark
a
young
officer
be
he
never
such
a
fop
or
profligate
must
take
his
turn
at
guard
and
carry
his
life
in
his
hand
all
over
the
world
wherever
he
is
sent
or
he
has
to
leave
the
service
service
yes
that
the
word
what
makes
every
young
respectable
though
he
think
it
he
is
serving
his
queen
his
country
the
devil
too
perhaps
very
likely
but
still
the
other
is
some
sort
he
is
bound
to
it
sworn
to
it
must
do
it
more
or
less
but
a
youngster
up
here
with
health
strength
and
heaps
of
money
bound
to
no
earthly
service
and
choosing
that
of
the
devil
and
his
own
lusts
because
some
service
or
other
he
must
have
i
want
to
know
where
else
under
the
sun
you
can
see
such
a
sight
as
that
tom
mumbled
something
to
the
effect
that
it
was
by
no
means
necessary
that
men
at
oxford
either
rich
or
poor
need
embark
in
the
service
which
had
been
alluded
to
which
remark
however
only
seemed
to
add
fuel
to
the
fire
for
hardy
now
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
striding
up
and
down
the
room
his
right
arm
behind
his
back
the
hand
gripping
his
left
elbow
his
left
hand
brought
round
in
front
close
to
his
body
and
holding
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
from
which
he
was
blowing
off
clouds
in
puffs
like
an
engine
just
starting
with
a
heavy
train
the
attitude
was
one
of
a
man
painfully
trying
to
curb
himself
his
eyes
burnt
like
coals
under
his
deep
brows
the
man
altogether
looked
awful
and
tom
felt
particularly
uncomfortable
and
puzzled
after
a
turn
or
two
hardy
burst
out
again
and
who
are
they
i
should
like
to
know
these
fellows
who
dare
to
offer
bribes
to
gentlemen
how
do
they
live
what
do
they
do
for
themselves
or
for
this
university
by
heaven
they
are
ruining
themselves
body
and
soul
and
making
this
place
which
was
meant
for
the
training
of
learned
and
brave
and
righteous
englishmen
a
lie
and
a
snare
and
who
tries
to
stop
them
here
and
there
a
don
is
doing
his
work
like
a
man
the
rest
are
either
washing
their
hands
of
the
business
and
spending
their
time
in
looking
after
those
who
do
want
looking
after
and
cramming
those
who
would
be
better
without
the
cramming
or
else
standing
by
cap
in
hand
and
shouting
young
men
of
large
fortune
and
great
connexions
you
future
dispensers
of
the
good
things
of
this
realm
come
to
our
colleges
and
all
shall
be
made
pleasant
and
the
shout
is
taken
up
by
undergraduates
and
tradesmen
and
and
and
to
us
and
us
and
us
and
we
will
be
your
toadies
let
them
let
them
toady
and
cringe
to
their
precious
idols
till
they
bring
this
noble
old
place
down
about
their
ears
down
it
will
come
down
it
must
come
for
down
it
ought
to
come
if
it
can
find
nothing
better
to
worship
than
rank
money
and
intellect
but
to
live
in
the
place
and
love
it
too
and
to
see
all
this
going
on
and
groan
and
writhe
under
it
and
not
be
at
this
point
in
his
speech
hardy
came
to
the
in
his
march
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
just
opposite
his
crockery
cupboard
but
instead
of
turning
as
usual
he
paused
let
go
the
hold
on
his
left
elbow
poised
himself
for
a
moment
to
get
a
purchase
and
then
dashed
his
right
fist
full
against
one
of
the
panels
crash
went
the
slight
deal
boards
as
if
struck
with
a
and
crash
went
glass
and
crockery
behind
tom
jumped
to
his
feet
in
doubt
whether
an
assault
on
him
would
not
follow
but
the
fit
was
over
and
hardy
looked
round
at
him
with
a
rueful
and
deprecating
face
for
a
moment
tom
tried
to
look
solemn
and
heroic
as
befitted
the
occasion
but
somehow
the
sudden
contrast
flashed
upon
him
and
sent
him
off
before
he
could
think
about
it
into
a
roar
of
laughter
ending
in
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
for
in
his
excitement
he
had
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
smoke
hardy
after
holding
out
for
a
moment
gave
in
to
the
humour
of
the
thing
and
the
appealing
look
passed
into
a
smile
and
the
smile
into
a
laugh
as
he
turned
towards
his
damaged
cupboard
and
began
opening
it
carefully
in
a
legitimate
manner
i
say
old
fellow
said
tom
coming
up
i
should
think
you
must
find
it
an
expensive
amusement
do
you
often
walk
into
your
cupboard
like
that
you
see
brown
i
am
naturally
a
man
of
a
very
quick
temper
so
it
seems
said
tom
but
does
it
hurt
your
knuckles
i
should
have
something
softer
put
up
for
me
if
i
were
you
your
bolster
with
a
velvet
cap
on
it
or
a
doctor
of
divinity
gown
now
you
be
hanged
said
hardy
as
he
disengaged
the
last
splinter
and
gently
opened
the
cupboard
door
oh
thunder
and
turf
look
here
he
went
on
as
the
state
of
affairs
inside
disclosed
itself
to
his
view
how
many
times
have
i
told
that
thief
george
never
to
put
anything
on
this
side
of
my
cupboard
two
tumblers
smashed
to
bits
and
i
only
four
in
the
world
lucky
we
had
those
two
out
on
the
table
and
here
a
great
piece
out
of
the
you
see
said
tom
holding
up
the
broken
article
and
let
me
see
one
cup
and
three
saucers
gone
to
glory
well
it
lucky
it
no
worse
said
hardy
peering
over
his
shoulder
i
had
a
lot
of
odd
saucers
and
there
enough
left
to
last
my
time
never
mind
the
smash
let
sit
down
again
and
be
reasonable
tom
sat
down
in
high
good
humor
he
felt
himself
more
on
an
equality
with
his
host
than
he
had
done
before
and
even
thought
he
might
venture
on
a
little
mild
expostulation
or
lecturing
but
while
he
was
considering
how
to
improve
the
occasion
hardy
began
himself
i
should
go
so
furious
brown
if
i
did
care
about
the
place
so
much
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
as
a
sort
of
learning
machine
in
which
i
am
to
grind
for
three
years
to
get
certain
degrees
which
i
want
no
this
place
and
cambridge
and
our
great
schools
are
the
heart
of
dear
old
england
did
you
ever
read
secretary
cook
address
to
the
doctors
in
more
critical
times
perhaps
even
than
ours
no
well
listen
then
and
he
went
to
his
bookcase
took
down
a
book
and
read
very
truth
is
that
all
wise
princes
respect
the
welfare
of
their
estates
and
consider
that
schools
and
universities
are
as
in
a
body
the
noble
and
vital
parts
which
being
vigorous
and
sound
send
good
blood
and
active
spirits
into
the
veins
and
arteries
which
cause
health
and
strength
or
if
feeble
or
corrupt
all
the
vital
parts
whereupon
grow
diseases
and
in
the
end
death
itself
a
low
standard
up
here
for
ten
years
may
corrupt
half
the
parishes
in
the
kingdom
that
true
said
tom
yes
and
so
one
has
a
right
to
be
jealous
for
oxford
every
englishman
ought
to
be
but
i
really
think
hardy
that
you
unreasonable
said
tom
who
had
no
mind
to
be
done
out
of
his
chance
of
lecturing
his
host
i
am
very
said
hardy
as
i
told
you
just
now
but
you
not
fair
on
the
fast
set
up
here
they
ca
help
being
rich
men
after
all
no
so
one
ought
to
expect
them
to
be
going
through
the
eyes
of
needles
i
suppose
but
do
you
mean
to
say
you
ever
heard
of
a
more
dirty
blackguard
business
than
this
said
hardy
he
ought
to
be
expelled
the
university
i
admit
that
said
tom
but
it
was
only
one
of
them
you
know
i
do
believe
there
another
man
in
the
set
who
would
have
done
it
well
i
hope
not
said
hardy
i
may
be
hard
on
them
as
you
say
they
ca
help
being
rich
but
now
i
do
want
you
to
think
me
a
violent
fanatic
shall
i
tell
you
some
of
my
experiences
up
here
some
passages
from
the
life
of
a
servitor
do
said
tom
i
should
like
nothing
so
well
chapter
viii
hardy
history
my
father
is
an
old
commander
in
the
royal
navy
he
was
a
second
cousin
of
nelson
hardy
and
that
believe
was
what
led
him
into
the
navy
for
he
had
no
interest
whatever
of
his
own
it
was
a
visit
which
nelson
hardy
then
a
young
lieutenant
paid
to
his
relative
my
grandfather
which
decided
my
father
he
has
told
me
but
he
always
had
a
strong
bent
to
the
sea
though
he
was
a
boy
of
very
studious
habits
however
those
were
times
when
brave
men
who
knew
and
loved
their
profession
could
be
overlooked
and
my
dear
old
father
fought
his
way
up
step
by
step
not
very
fast
certainly
but
still
fast
enough
to
keep
him
in
heart
about
his
chances
in
life
i
can
show
you
the
accounts
of
some
of
the
affairs
he
was
in
in
james
history
which
you
see
up
on
my
shelf
there
or
i
could
tell
them
you
myself
but
i
hope
some
day
you
will
know
him
and
then
you
will
hear
them
in
perfection
my
father
was
made
commander
towards
the
end
of
the
war
and
got
a
ship
which
he
sailed
with
a
convoy
of
merchantmen
from
bristol
it
was
the
last
voyage
he
ever
made
in
active
service
but
the
admiralty
was
so
well
satisfied
with
his
conduct
in
it
that
they
kept
his
ship
in
commission
two
years
after
peace
was
declared
and
well
they
might
be
for
in
the
spanish
main
he
fought
an
action
which
lasted
on
and
off
for
two
days
with
a
french
sloop
of
war
and
a
privateer
which
he
always
thought
was
an
american
either
of
which
ought
to
have
been
a
match
for
him
but
he
had
been
with
vincent
in
the
and
was
not
likely
to
think
much
of
such
small
odds
as
that
at
any
rate
he
beat
them
off
and
not
a
prize
could
either
of
them
make
out
of
his
convoy
though
i
believe
his
ship
was
never
fit
for
anything
afterwards
and
was
broken
up
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
commission
we
have
got
her
compasses
and
the
old
flag
which
flew
at
the
peak
through
the
whole
voyage
at
home
now
it
was
my
father
own
flag
and
his
fancy
to
have
it
always
flying
more
than
half
the
men
were
killed
or
badly
hit
the
dear
old
father
amongst
the
rest
a
ball
took
off
part
of
his
knee
cap
and
he
had
to
fight
the
last
six
hours
of
the
action
sitting
in
a
chair
on
the
but
he
says
it
made
the
men
fight
better
than
when
he
was
among
them
seeing
him
sitting
there
sucking
oranges
well
he
came
home
with
a
stiff
leg
the
bristol
merchants
gave
him
the
freedom
of
the
city
in
a
gold
box
and
a
sword
with
an
inscription
on
the
blade
which
hangs
over
the
at
home
when
i
first
left
home
i
asked
him
to
give
me
his
old
service
sword
which
used
to
hang
by
the
other
and
he
gave
it
me
at
once
though
i
was
only
a
lad
of
seventeen
as
he
would
give
me
his
right
eye
dear
old
father
which
is
the
only
one
he
has
now
the
other
he
lost
from
a
cutlass
wound
in
a
there
it
hangs
and
those
are
his
epaulettes
in
the
tin
case
they
used
to
lie
under
my
pillow
before
i
had
a
room
of
my
own
and
many
a
cowardly
fit
have
they
helped
me
to
pull
through
brown
and
many
a
mean
act
have
they
helped
to
keep
me
from
doing
there
they
are
always
and
the
sight
of
them
brings
home
the
dear
old
man
to
me
as
nothing
else
does
hardly
even
his
letters
i
must
be
a
great
scoundrel
to
go
very
wrong
with
such
a
father
let
see
where
was
i
oh
yes
i
remember
well
my
father
got
his
box
and
sword
and
some
very
handsome
letters
from
several
great
men
we
have
them
all
in
a
book
at
home
and
i
know
them
by
heart
the
ones
he
values
most
are
from
collingwood
and
his
old
captain
vincent
and
from
his
cousin
nelson
hardy
who
come
off
very
well
himself
after
the
war
but
my
poor
old
father
never
got
another
ship
for
some
time
he
went
up
every
year
to
london
and
was
always
he
says
very
kindly
received
by
the
people
in
power
and
often
dined
with
one
and
another
lord
of
the
admiralty
who
had
been
an
old
messmate
but
he
was
longing
for
employment
and
it
used
to
prey
on
him
while
he
was
in
his
prime
to
feel
year
after
year
slipping
away
and
he
still
without
a
ship
but
why
should
i
abuse
people
and
think
it
hard
when
he
does
see
jack
he
said
to
me
the
last
time
we
spoke
about
it
all
i
was
a
battered
old
hulk
lame
and
half
blind
so
was
nelson
you
say
but
every
man
is
a
nelson
my
boy
though
i
might
think
i
could
con
or
fight
a
ship
as
well
as
ever
i
ca
say
other
folk
who
did
know
me
were
wrong
for
not
agreeing
with
me
would
you
now
jack
appoint
a
lame
and
blind
man
to
command
your
ship
if
you
had
one
but
he
left
off
applying
for
work
as
soon
as
he
was
fifty
i
just
remember
the
time
for
he
began
to
doubt
then
whether
he
was
quite
so
fit
to
command
a
vessel
as
a
younger
man
and
though
he
had
a
much
better
chance
after
that
of
getting
a
ship
for
william
iv
came
to
the
throne
who
knew
all
about
him
he
never
went
near
the
admiralty
again
forbid
he
said
his
majesty
should
take
me
if
there
a
better
man
to
be
had
but
i
have
forgotten
to
tell
you
how
i
came
into
the
world
and
am
telling
you
my
father
story
instead
of
my
own
you
seem
to
like
hearing
about
it
though
and
you
ca
understand
one
without
the
other
however
when
my
father
was
made
commander
he
married
and
bought
with
his
and
savings
a
cottage
and
piece
of
land
in
a
village
on
the
south
coast
where
he
left
his
wife
when
he
went
on
his
last
voyage
they
had
waited
some
years
for
neither
of
them
had
any
money
but
there
never
were
two
people
who
wanted
it
less
or
did
more
good
without
it
to
all
who
came
near
them
they
had
a
hard
time
of
it
too
for
my
father
had
to
go
on
and
a
commander
is
much
to
live
upon
and
keep
a
family
for
they
had
a
family
three
besides
me
but
they
are
all
gone
and
my
mother
too
she
died
when
i
was
quite
a
boy
and
left
him
and
me
alone
and
since
then
i
have
never
known
what
a
woman
love
is
for
i
have
no
near
relations
and
a
man
with
such
prospects
as
mine
had
better
keep
down
all
however
there
no
need
to
go
into
any
notion
i
wander
any
more
if
i
can
help
it
i
know
my
father
was
very
poor
when
my
mother
died
and
i
think
though
he
never
told
me
so
that
he
had
mortgaged
our
cottage
and
was
very
near
having
to
sell
it
at
one
time
the
expenses
of
my
mother
illness
had
been
very
heavy
i
know
a
good
deal
of
the
best
furniture
was
sold
all
indeed
except
a
handsome
arm
chair
and
a
little
work
table
of
my
mother
she
used
to
sit
in
the
chair
in
her
last
illness
on
our
lawn
and
watch
the
sunsets
and
he
sat
by
her
and
watched
her
and
sometimes
read
the
bible
to
her
while
i
played
about
with
a
big
black
dog
we
had
then
named
vincent
after
my
father
old
captain
or
with
burt
his
old
boatswain
who
came
with
his
wife
to
live
with
my
father
before
i
can
recollect
and
lives
with
us
still
he
did
everything
in
the
garden
and
about
the
house
and
in
the
house
too
when
his
wife
was
ill
for
he
can
turn
his
hand
to
most
anything
like
most
old
salts
it
was
he
who
rigged
up
the
mast
and
on
the
lawn
and
used
to
let
me
run
up
the
old
flag
on
sundays
and
on
my
father
and
on
the
anniversary
of
his
action
and
of
vincent
action
in
the
arrow
after
my
mother
death
my
father
sent
away
all
the
servants
for
the
boatswain
and
his
wife
are
more
like
friends
i
was
wrong
to
say
that
no
woman
has
loved
me
since
my
mother
death
for
i
believe
dear
old
nanny
loves
me
as
if
i
were
her
own
child
my
father
after
this
used
to
sit
silent
for
hours
together
doing
nothing
but
look
over
the
sea
but
except
for
that
was
not
much
changed
after
a
short
time
he
took
to
teaching
me
to
read
and
from
that
time
i
never
was
away
from
him
for
an
hour
except
when
i
was
asleep
until
i
went
out
into
the
world
as
i
told
you
my
father
was
naturally
fond
of
study
he
had
kept
up
the
little
latin
he
had
learnt
as
a
boy
and
had
always
been
reading
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
so
that
i
could
have
had
a
better
tutor
they
were
no
lessons
to
me
particularly
the
geographical
ones
for
there
was
no
part
of
the
world
that
he
did
not
know
and
could
tell
me
what
it
and
the
people
were
like
and
often
when
burt
happened
to
come
in
at
such
times
and
heard
what
my
father
was
talking
about
he
would
give
us
some
of
his
adventures
and
ideas
of
geography
which
were
very
queer
indeed
when
i
was
nearly
ten
a
new
vicar
came
he
was
about
my
father
age
and
a
widower
like
him
only
he
had
no
child
like
him
too
he
had
no
private
fortune
and
the
living
is
a
very
poor
one
he
soon
became
very
intimate
with
us
and
made
my
father
his
churchwarden
and
after
being
present
at
some
of
our
lessons
volunteered
to
teach
me
greek
which
he
said
it
was
time
i
should
begin
to
learn
this
was
great
relief
to
my
father
who
had
bought
a
greek
grammar
and
dictionary
and
a
delectus
some
time
before
and
i
could
see
him
often
dear
old
father
with
his
glass
in
his
eye
puzzling
away
over
them
when
i
was
playing
or
reading
voyages
for
it
had
grown
to
be
the
wish
of
his
heart
that
i
should
be
a
scholar
and
should
go
into
orders
so
he
was
going
to
teach
me
greek
himself
for
there
was
no
one
in
the
parish
except
the
vicar
who
knew
a
word
of
anything
but
english
so
that
he
could
not
have
got
me
a
tutor
and
the
thought
of
sending
me
to
school
had
never
crossed
his
mind
even
if
he
could
have
afforded
to
do
either
my
father
only
sat
by
at
greek
lessons
and
took
no
part
but
first
he
began
to
put
in
a
word
here
and
there
and
then
would
repeat
words
and
sentences
himself
and
look
over
my
book
while
i
construed
and
very
soon
was
just
as
regular
a
pupil
of
the
vicar
as
i
the
vicar
was
for
the
most
part
very
proud
of
his
pupils
and
the
kindest
of
masters
but
every
now
and
then
be
used
to
be
hard
on
my
father
which
made
me
furious
though
he
never
seemed
to
mind
it
i
used
to
make
mistakes
on
purpose
at
those
times
to
show
that
i
was
worse
than
he
at
any
rate
but
this
only
happened
after
we
had
had
a
political
discussion
at
dinner
for
we
dined
at
three
and
took
to
our
greek
afterwards
to
suit
the
time
who
was
generally
a
guest
my
father
is
a
tory
of
course
as
you
may
guess
and
the
vicar
was
a
liberal
of
a
very
mild
sort
as
i
have
since
thought
a
whig
of
he
used
to
call
himself
but
he
was
in
favor
of
the
reform
bill
which
was
enough
for
my
father
who
lectured
him
about
loyalty
and
opening
the
to
revolution
and
used
to
call
up
old
burt
from
the
kitchen
where
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
and
ask
him
what
he
used
to
think
of
the
radicals
on
board
ship
and
burt
regular
reply
was
yer
honor
regular
skulks
i
would
give
the
twist
of
a
fiddler
elbow
for
all
the
lot
of
as
ever
pretended
to
handle
a
swab
or
handle
a
topsail
the
vicar
always
tried
to
argue
but
as
burt
and
i
were
the
only
audience
my
father
was
always
triumphant
only
he
took
it
out
of
us
afterwards
at
the
greek
often
i
used
to
think
when
they
were
reading
history
and
talking
about
the
characters
that
my
father
was
much
the
more
liberal
of
the
two
about
this
time
he
bought
a
small
boat
of
ten
tons
for
he
and
burt
agreed
that
i
ought
to
learn
to
handle
a
boat
although
i
was
not
to
go
to
sea
and
when
they
got
the
vicar
in
the
boat
on
the
summer
evenings
for
he
was
always
ready
for
a
sale
though
he
was
a
very
bad
sailor
i
believe
they
used
to
steer
as
near
the
wind
as
possible
and
get
into
short
chopping
seas
on
purpose
but
i
do
think
he
was
ever
frightened
though
he
used
sometimes
to
be
very
and
so
i
went
on
learned
all
i
could
from
my
father
and
the
vicar
and
old
burt
till
i
was
sixteen
by
that
time
i
had
begun
to
think
for
myself
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
time
i
should
do
something
no
boy
ever
wanted
to
leave
home
less
i
believe
but
i
saw
that
i
must
make
a
move
if
i
was
ever
to
be
what
my
father
wished
me
to
be
so
i
spoke
to
the
vicar
and
he
quite
agreed
with
me
and
made
inquiries
amongst
his
acquaintance
and
so
before
i
was
seventeen
i
was
offered
the
place
of
in
a
commercial
school
about
twenty
miles
from
home
the
vicar
brought
the
offer
and
my
father
was
very
angry
at
first
but
we
talked
him
over
and
so
i
took
the
situation
and
i
am
very
glad
i
did
although
there
were
many
drawbacks
the
salary
was
a
year
and
for
that
i
had
to
drill
all
the
boys
in
english
and
arithmetic
and
latin
and
to
teach
the
greek
grammar
to
the
five
or
six
who
paid
extra
to
learn
it
out
of
the
school
i
had
always
to
be
with
them
and
was
responsible
for
the
discipline
it
was
weary
work
very
often
and
what
seemed
the
worst
part
of
it
to
me
at
the
time
was
the
trade
spirit
which
leavened
the
whole
of
the
establishment
the
master
and
owner
of
the
school
who
was
a
keen
vulgar
man
but
always
civil
enough
to
me
thought
of
nothing
but
what
would
pay
and
this
seemed
to
be
what
filled
the
school
fathers
sent
their
boys
because
the
place
was
so
practical
and
nothing
was
taught
except
as
extras
which
was
not
to
be
of
real
use
to
the
boys
in
the
world
we
had
our
work
quite
clearly
laid
down
for
us
and
it
was
not
to
put
the
boys
in
the
way
of
getting
real
knowledge
or
understanding
or
any
of
the
things
solomon
talks
about
but
to
put
them
in
the
way
of
getting
on
i
spent
three
years
at
that
school
and
in
that
time
i
rounded
myself
pretty
well
in
latin
and
greek
better
i
believe
than
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
been
at
a
school
myself
and
i
hope
i
did
the
boys
some
good
and
taught
some
of
them
that
cunning
was
not
the
best
quality
to
start
in
life
with
and
i
was
not
often
very
unhappy
for
i
could
always
look
forward
to
my
holidays
with
my
father
however
i
own
that
i
never
was
better
pleased
than
one
christmas
when
the
vicar
came
over
to
our
cottage
and
brought
with
him
a
letter
from
the
principal
of
ambrose
college
oxford
appointing
me
to
a
servitorship
my
father
was
even
more
delighted
than
i
and
that
evening
produced
a
bottle
of
old
rum
which
was
part
of
his
ship
stock
and
had
gone
all
through
his
action
and
been
in
his
cellar
ever
since
and
we
three
in
the
parlor
and
old
burt
and
his
wife
in
the
kitchen
finished
it
that
night
the
boatswain
i
must
own
taking
the
lion
share
the
vicar
took
occasion
in
the
course
of
the
evening
to
hint
that
it
was
only
poor
men
who
took
these
places
at
the
university
and
that
i
might
find
some
inconvenience
and
suffer
some
annoyance
by
not
being
exactly
in
the
same
position
as
other
men
but
my
dear
old
father
would
not
hear
of
it
i
was
now
going
to
be
in
amongst
the
very
pick
of
english
gentlemen
what
could
it
matter
whether
i
had
money
or
not
that
was
the
last
thing
which
real
gentlemen
thought
of
besides
why
was
i
to
be
so
very
poor
he
should
be
able
to
allow
me
whatever
would
be
necessary
to
make
me
comfortable
jack
he
said
suddenly
later
in
the
evening
meets
low
fellows
everywhere
you
have
met
them
i
know
often
at
the
confounded
school
and
will
meet
them
again
never
you
be
ashamed
of
your
poverty
my
boy
i
promised
readily
enough
for
i
did
think
i
could
be
more
tried
in
that
way
than
i
had
been
already
i
had
lived
for
three
years
amongst
people
whose
class
notoriously
measured
all
things
by
a
money
standard
now
that
was
all
over
i
thought
it
easy
making
promises
in
the
dark
the
vicar
however
would
not
let
the
matter
rest
so
we
resolved
ourselves
into
a
committee
of
ways
and
means
and
my
father
engaged
to
lay
before
us
an
exact
statement
of
his
affairs
next
day
i
went
to
the
door
with
the
vicar
and
he
told
me
to
come
and
see
him
in
the
morning
i
what
he
wanted
to
see
me
for
he
knew
all
my
father
affairs
perfectly
well
and
wished
to
prepare
me
for
what
was
to
come
in
the
evening
father
he
said
one
of
the
most
liberal
men
i
ever
met
he
is
almost
the
only
person
who
gives
anything
to
the
schools
and
other
charities
in
this
parish
and
he
gives
to
the
utmost
you
would
not
wish
him
i
know
to
cut
off
these
gifts
which
bring
the
highest
reward
with
them
when
they
are
made
in
the
spirit
in
which
he
makes
them
then
he
is
getting
old
and
you
would
never
like
him
to
deny
himself
the
comforts
and
few
enough
they
are
which
he
is
used
to
he
has
nothing
but
his
to
live
on
and
out
of
that
he
pays
a
year
for
insurance
for
he
has
insured
his
life
that
you
may
have
something
besides
the
cottage
and
land
when
he
dies
i
only
tell
you
this
that
you
may
know
the
facts
beforehand
i
am
sure
you
would
never
take
a
penny
from
him
if
you
could
help
it
but
he
wo
be
happy
unless
he
makes
you
some
allowance
and
he
can
do
it
without
crippling
himself
he
has
been
paying
off
an
old
mortgage
on
his
property
here
for
many
years
by
installments
of
a
year
and
the
last
was
paid
last
michaelmas
so
that
it
will
not
inconvenience
him
to
make
you
that
allowance
now
you
will
not
be
able
to
live
properly
upon
that
at
oxford
even
as
a
servitor
i
speak
to
you
now
my
dear
jack
as
your
oldest
friend
except
burt
and
you
must
allow
me
the
privilege
of
an
old
friend
i
have
more
than
i
want
and
i
propose
to
make
your
allowance
at
oxford
to
a
year
and
upon
that
i
think
you
may
manage
to
get
on
now
it
will
not
be
quite
candid
but
i
think
under
the
circumstances
we
shall
be
justified
in
representing
to
your
father
that
a
year
will
be
ample
for
him
to
allow
you
you
see
what
i
mean
i
remember
almost
word
for
word
what
the
vicar
said
for
it
is
not
often
in
one
life
that
one
meets
with
this
sort
of
friend
at
first
i
thanked
him
but
refused
to
take
anything
from
him
i
had
saved
enough
i
said
to
carry
me
through
oxford
but
he
would
not
be
put
off
and
i
found
that
his
heart
was
as
much
set
on
making
me
an
allowance
himself
as
on
saving
my
father
so
i
agreed
to
take
a
year
from
him
when
we
met
again
in
the
evening
to
hear
my
father
statement
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
the
dear
old
man
with
his
spectacles
on
and
his
papers
before
him
proving
in
some
wonderful
way
that
he
could
easily
allow
me
at
least
or
a
year
i
believe
it
cost
the
vicar
some
twinges
of
conscience
to
persuade
him
that
all
i
should
want
would
be
a
year
and
it
was
very
hard
work
but
at
last
we
succeeded
and
it
was
so
settled
during
the
next
three
weeks
the
preparations
for
my
start
occupied
us
all
the
vicar
looked
out
all
the
classics
which
he
insisted
that
i
should
take
there
they
stand
on
that
middle
shelf
all
well
bound
you
see
and
many
of
them
old
college
prizes
my
father
made
an
expedition
to
the
nearest
town
and
came
back
with
a
large
new
portmanteau
and
and
the
next
day
the
leading
tailor
came
over
to
fit
me
out
with
new
clothes
in
fact
if
i
had
not
resisted
stoutly
i
should
have
come
to
college
with
half
the
contents
of
the
cottage
and
burt
as
valet
for
the
old
boatswain
was
as
bad
as
the
other
two
but
i
compromised
the
matter
with
him
by
accepting
his
pocket
compass
and
the
picture
of
the
brig
which
hangs
there
the
two
things
next
to
his
wife
which
he
values
i
believe
most
in
the
world
well
it
is
now
two
years
last
october
since
i
came
to
oxford
as
a
servitor
so
you
see
i
have
pretty
nearly
finished
my
time
here
i
was
more
than
twenty
then
much
older
as
you
know
than
most
freshmen
i
daresay
it
was
partly
owing
to
the
difference
in
age
and
partly
to
the
fact
that
i
knew
no
one
when
i
came
up
but
mostly
to
my
own
bad
management
and
odd
temper
that
i
did
not
get
on
better
than
i
have
done
with
the
men
here
sometimes
i
think
that
our
college
is
a
bad
specimen
for
i
have
made
several
friends
amongst
men
at
any
rate
the
fact
is
as
you
have
no
doubt
found
out
and
i
hope
i
have
tried
at
all
to
conceal
it
that
i
am
out
of
the
pale
as
it
were
in
fact
with
the
exception
of
one
of
the
tutors
and
one
man
who
was
a
freshman
with
me
i
do
not
know
a
man
in
college
except
as
a
mere
speaking
acquaintance
i
had
been
rather
thrown
off
my
balance
i
think
at
the
change
in
my
life
for
at
first
i
made
a
great
fool
of
myself
i
had
believed
too
readily
what
my
father
had
said
and
thought
that
at
oxford
i
should
see
no
more
of
what
i
had
been
used
to
here
i
thought
that
the
last
thing
a
man
would
be
valued
by
would
be
the
length
of
his
purse
and
that
no
one
would
look
down
upon
me
because
i
performed
some
services
to
the
college
in
return
for
my
keep
instead
of
paying
for
it
in
money
yes
i
made
a
great
fool
of
myself
no
doubt
of
that
and
what
is
worse
i
broke
my
promise
to
my
father
i
often
ashamed
of
my
poverty
and
tried
at
first
to
hide
it
for
somehow
the
spirit
of
the
place
carried
me
along
with
it
i
could
help
wishing
to
be
thought
of
and
treated
as
an
equal
by
the
men
a
very
bitter
thing
for
a
proud
shy
sensitive
fellow
as
i
am
by
nature
to
have
to
bear
the
sort
of
assumption
and
insolence
one
meets
with
i
furnished
my
rooms
well
and
dressed
well
ah
you
stare
but
this
is
not
the
furniture
i
started
with
i
sold
it
all
when
i
came
to
my
senses
and
put
in
this
stuff
and
i
have
worn
out
my
fine
clothes
i
know
i
not
well
dressed
now
tom
nodded
ready
acquiescence
to
this
position
yes
though
i
still
wince
a
little
now
and
then
a
great
deal
oftener
than
i
like
i
do
carry
any
false
colors
i
ca
quite
conquer
the
feeling
of
shame
for
shame
it
is
i
am
afraid
but
at
any
rate
i
do
try
to
hide
my
poverty
any
longer
i
have
for
these
eighteen
months
i
have
a
grim
sort
of
pleasure
in
pushing
it
in
everybody
face
tom
assented
with
a
smile
remembering
how
excessively
uncomfortable
hardy
had
made
him
by
this
little
peculiarity
the
first
time
he
was
in
his
rooms
the
first
thing
which
opened
my
eyes
a
little
was
the
conduct
of
the
tradesmen
my
bills
all
came
in
within
a
week
of
the
delivery
of
the
furniture
and
clothes
some
of
them
leave
the
things
without
payment
i
was
very
angry
and
vexed
not
at
the
bills
for
i
had
my
savings
which
were
more
than
enough
to
pay
for
everything
but
i
knew
that
these
same
tradesmen
never
thought
of
asking
for
payment
under
a
year
oftener
two
from
other
men
well
it
was
a
lesson
credit
for
dealings
with
servitors
i
owe
the
oxford
tradesmen
much
for
that
lesson
if
they
would
only
treat
every
man
who
comes
up
as
a
servitor
it
would
save
a
deal
of
misery
my
cure
was
completed
by
much
higher
folk
though
i
ca
go
through
the
whole
treatment
but
will
give
you
a
specimen
or
two
of
the
doses
giving
precedence
as
is
the
way
here
to
those
administered
by
the
highest
in
rank
i
got
them
from
all
sorts
of
people
but
none
did
me
more
good
than
the
lords
pills
amongst
other
ways
of
getting
on
i
took
to
sparring
which
was
then
very
much
in
vogue
i
am
a
good
hand
at
it
and
very
fond
of
it
so
that
it
was
altogether
flunkeyism
i
glad
to
think
in
my
second
term
two
or
three
fighting
men
came
down
from
london
and
gave
a
benefit
at
the
weirs
i
was
there
and
set
to
with
one
of
them
we
were
well
matched
and
both
of
us
did
our
very
best
and
when
we
had
had
our
turn
we
drew
down
the
house
as
they
say
several
young
tufts
and
others
of
the
faster
men
came
up
to
me
afterwards
and
complimented
me
they
did
the
same
by
the
professional
but
it
did
occur
to
me
at
the
time
that
they
put
us
both
in
the
same
category
i
am
free
to
own
that
i
was
really
pleased
two
days
afterwards
when
a
most
elaborate
flunkey
brought
a
card
to
my
door
inscribed
viscount
philippine
ch
at
home
eight
sparring
luckily
i
made
a
light
dinner
and
went
sharp
to
time
into
christ
church
the
porter
directed
me
to
the
noble
viscount
rooms
they
were
most
splendid
certainly
first
floor
rooms
in
peckwater
i
was
shown
into
the
large
room
which
was
magnificently
furnished
and
lighted
a
good
space
was
cleared
in
the
centre
there
were
all
sorts
of
bottles
and
glasses
on
the
sideboard
there
might
have
been
twelve
or
thirteen
men
present
almost
all
in
tufts
or
gentlemen
commoners
caps
one
or
two
of
our
college
i
recognized
the
fighting
man
was
also
there
stripped
for
sparring
which
none
of
the
rest
were
it
was
plain
that
the
sport
had
not
begun
i
think
he
was
doing
some
trick
of
strength
as
i
came
in
my
noble
host
came
forward
with
a
nod
and
asked
me
if
i
would
take
anything
and
when
i
declined
said
will
you
put
on
the
gloves
i
looked
at
him
rather
surprised
and
thought
it
an
odd
way
to
treat
the
only
stranger
in
his
rooms
however
i
stripped
put
on
the
gloves
and
one
of
the
others
came
forward
to
tie
them
for
me
while
he
was
doing
it
i
heard
my
host
say
to
the
man
note
mind
if
you
do
it
within
the
time
then
my
lord
he
answered
the
man
who
was
tying
my
gloves
said
steady
do
give
him
a
chance
to
knock
you
down
it
flashed
across
me
in
a
moment
now
why
i
was
there
but
it
was
too
late
to
draw
back
so
we
stood
up
and
began
sparring
i
played
very
steadily
and
light
at
first
to
see
whether
my
suspicions
were
well
founded
and
in
two
minutes
i
was
satisfied
my
opponent
tried
every
dodge
to
bring
on
a
rally
and
when
he
was
foiled
i
could
see
that
he
was
shifting
his
glove
i
stopped
and
insisted
that
his
gloves
should
be
tied
and
then
we
went
on
again
i
kept
on
the
defensive
the
man
was
in
bad
training
and
luckily
i
had
the
advantage
by
an
inch
or
so
in
length
of
arm
before
five
minutes
was
over
i
had
caught
enough
of
the
bystander
remarks
to
know
that
my
noble
host
had
betted
a
pony
that
i
should
be
knocked
down
in
a
my
one
object
now
was
to
make
him
lose
his
money
my
opponent
did
his
utmost
for
his
patron
and
fairly
winded
himself
in
his
efforts
to
get
at
me
he
had
to
call
time
twice
himself
i
said
not
a
word
my
time
would
come
i
knew
if
i
could
keep
on
my
legs
and
of
this
i
had
little
fear
i
held
myself
together
made
no
attack
and
my
length
of
arm
gave
me
the
advantage
in
every
counter
it
was
all
i
could
do
though
to
keep
clear
of
his
rushes
as
the
time
drew
on
on
he
came
time
after
time
careless
of
guarding
and
he
was
full
as
good
a
man
as
i
up
past
the
quarter
by
jove
half
a
minute
yet
now
your
time
said
my
noble
host
to
his
man
who
answered
by
a
rush
i
met
him
as
before
with
a
steady
counter
but
this
time
my
blow
got
home
under
his
chin
and
he
staggered
lost
his
footing
and
went
fairly
over
on
his
back
most
of
the
bystanders
seemed
delighted
and
some
of
them
hurried
towards
me
but
i
tore
off
the
gloves
flung
them
on
the
ground
and
turned
to
my
host
i
could
hardly
speak
but
i
made
an
effort
and
said
quietly
have
brought
a
stranger
to
your
rooms
and
have
tried
to
make
him
fight
for
your
amusement
now
i
tell
you
it
is
a
blackguard
act
of
yours
an
act
which
no
gentleman
would
have
done
my
noble
host
made
no
remark
i
threw
on
my
and
then
turned
to
the
rest
and
said
would
not
have
stood
by
and
seen
it
done
i
went
up
to
the
uncorked
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
half
filled
a
tumbler
before
a
word
was
spoken
then
one
of
the
visitors
stepped
forward
and
said
hardy
i
hope
you
go
there
has
been
a
mistake
we
did
not
know
of
this
i
am
sure
many
of
us
are
very
sorry
for
what
has
occurred
stay
and
look
on
we
will
all
of
us
spar
i
looked
at
him
and
then
at
my
host
to
see
whether
the
latter
joined
in
the
apology
not
he
he
was
doing
the
dignified
sulky
and
most
of
the
rest
seemed
to
me
to
be
with
him
any
of
you
spar
with
me
i
said
tauntingly
tossing
off
the
champagne
the
new
speaker
said
directly
you
wish
it
and
are
not
too
tired
i
will
spar
with
you
myself
you
will
wo
you
james
and
he
turned
to
one
of
the
other
men
if
any
of
them
had
backed
him
by
a
word
i
should
probably
have
stayed
several
of
them
i
learnt
afterwards
would
have
liked
to
have
done
so
but
it
was
an
awkward
scene
to
interfere
in
i
stopped
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
sneer
too
small
and
none
of
the
other
gentlemen
seem
inclined
to
offer
i
saw
that
i
had
hurt
him
and
felt
pleased
at
the
moment
i
had
done
so
i
was
now
ready
to
start
and
i
could
not
think
of
anything
more
unpleasant
to
say
at
the
moment
so
i
went
up
to
my
antagonist
who
was
standing
with
the
gloves
on
still
not
quite
knowing
what
to
be
at
and
held
out
my
hand
can
shake
hands
with
you
at
any
rate
i
said
only
did
what
you
were
paid
for
in
the
regular
way
of
business
and
you
did
your
best
he
looked
rather
sheepish
but
held
out
his
gloved
hand
which
i
shook
i
have
the
honor
to
wish
you
all
a
very
good
evening
and
so
i
left
the
place
and
got
home
to
my
own
rooms
and
sat
down
there
with
several
new
ideas
in
my
head
on
the
whole
the
lesson
was
not
a
very
bitter
one
for
i
felt
that
i
had
had
the
best
of
the
game
the
only
thing
i
really
was
sorry
for
was
my
own
insolence
to
the
man
who
had
come
forward
as
a
peacemaker
i
had
remarked
his
face
before
i
do
know
how
it
is
with
you
but
i
can
never
help
looking
at
a
tuft
the
gold
tassel
draws
one
eye
somehow
and
then
it
an
awful
position
after
all
for
mere
boys
to
be
placed
in
so
i
knew
his
face
before
that
day
though
i
had
only
seen
him
two
or
three
times
in
the
street
now
it
was
much
more
clearly
impressed
on
my
mind
and
i
called
it
up
and
looked
it
over
half
hoping
that
i
should
detect
something
to
justify
me
to
myself
but
without
success
however
i
got
the
whole
affair
pretty
well
out
of
my
head
by
bedtime
while
i
was
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
my
scout
came
in
with
a
face
of
the
most
ludicrous
importance
and
quite
a
deferential
manner
i
declare
i
do
think
he
has
ever
got
back
since
that
day
to
his
original
swagger
he
laid
a
card
on
my
table
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
ludship
is
houtside
watin
sir
i
had
had
enough
of
lords
cards
and
the
scene
of
yesterday
rose
painfully
before
me
as
i
threw
the
card
into
the
fire
without
looking
at
it
and
said
him
i
am
engaged
my
scout
with
something
like
a
shudder
at
my
audacity
replied
ludship
told
me
to
say
sir
as
his
was
very
particular
so
hif
you
was
engaged
he
would
call
again
in
an
hour
tell
him
to
come
in
then
if
he
wo
take
a
civil
hint
i
felt
sure
who
it
would
be
but
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
pleased
or
annoyed
when
in
another
minute
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
the
peacemaker
i
do
know
which
of
us
was
the
most
embarrassed
he
walked
straight
up
to
me
without
lifting
his
eyes
and
held
out
his
hand
saying
hope
hardy
you
will
shake
hands
with
me
now
my
lord
i
said
taking
his
hand
am
sorry
for
what
i
said
to
you
yesterday
when
my
blood
was
up
said
no
more
than
we
deserved
he
answered
twirling
his
cap
by
the
long
gold
tassel
could
not
be
comfortable
without
coming
to
assure
you
again
myself
that
neither
i
nor
i
believe
half
the
men
in
philippine
rooms
yesterday
knew
anything
of
the
bet
i
really
can
not
tell
you
how
annoyed
i
have
been
about
it
i
assured
him
that
he
might
make
himself
quite
easy
and
then
remained
standing
expecting
him
to
go
and
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
say
further
but
he
begged
me
to
go
on
with
my
breakfast
and
sat
down
and
then
asked
me
to
give
him
a
cup
of
tea
as
he
had
not
breakfasted
so
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
sitting
opposite
one
another
over
tea
and
bread
and
butter
for
he
did
ask
for
and
i
did
offer
anything
else
it
was
rather
a
trying
meal
for
each
of
us
was
doing
all
he
could
to
make
out
the
other
i
only
hope
i
was
as
pleasant
as
he
was
after
breakfast
he
went
and
i
thought
the
acquaintance
was
probably
at
an
end
he
had
done
all
that
a
gentleman
need
have
done
and
had
healed
a
raw
place
in
my
mental
skin
but
i
was
mistaken
without
intruding
himself
on
me
he
managed
somehow
or
another
to
keep
on
building
up
the
acquaintance
little
by
little
for
some
time
i
looked
out
very
jealously
for
any
patronizing
airs
and
even
after
i
was
convinced
that
he
had
nothing
of
the
sort
in
him
avoided
him
as
much
as
i
could
though
he
was
the
most
pleasant
and
man
i
knew
however
we
became
intimate
and
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
in
a
quiet
way
at
his
own
rooms
i
would
go
to
his
parties
and
asked
him
not
to
come
to
me
here
for
my
horror
of
being
thought
a
had
become
almost
a
disease
he
was
not
so
old
as
i
but
he
was
just
leaving
the
university
for
he
had
come
up
early
and
lord
sons
are
allowed
to
go
out
in
two
years
i
suppose
because
the
authorities
think
they
will
do
less
harm
here
in
two
than
three
years
but
it
is
sometimes
hard
on
poor
men
who
have
to
earn
their
bread
to
see
such
a
privilege
given
to
those
who
want
it
least
when
he
left
he
made
me
promise
to
go
and
pay
him
a
visit
which
i
did
in
the
long
vacation
at
a
splendid
place
up
in
the
north
and
enjoyed
myself
more
than
i
care
to
own
his
father
who
is
quite
worthy
of
his
son
and
all
his
family
were
as
kind
as
people
could
be
well
amongst
other
folks
i
met
there
a
young
sprig
of
nobility
who
was
coming
up
here
the
next
term
he
had
been
brought
up
abroad
and
i
suppose
knew
very
few
men
of
his
own
age
in
england
he
was
not
a
bad
style
of
boy
but
rather
too
demonstrative
and
not
he
took
to
me
wonderfully
was
delighted
to
hear
that
i
was
up
at
oxford
and
talked
constantly
of
how
much
we
should
see
of
one
another
as
it
happened
i
was
almost
the
first
man
he
met
when
he
got
off
the
coach
at
the
at
the
beginning
of
his
first
term
he
almost
embraced
me
and
nothing
would
serve
but
i
must
dine
with
him
at
the
inn
and
we
spent
the
evening
together
and
parted
dear
friends
two
days
afterwards
we
met
in
the
street
he
was
with
two
other
youngsters
and
gave
me
a
polished
and
distant
bow
in
another
week
he
passed
me
as
if
we
had
never
met
i
do
blame
him
poor
boy
my
only
wonder
is
that
any
of
them
ever
get
through
this
place
without
being
thoroughly
spoilt
from
down
to
scout
boy
the
whole
of
oxford
seems
to
be
in
league
to
turn
their
boys
heads
even
if
they
come
up
with
them
set
on
straight
which
toadying
servants
at
home
take
care
shall
never
happen
if
they
can
hinder
it
the
only
men
who
would
do
them
good
up
here
both
dons
and
undergraduates
keep
out
of
their
way
very
naturally
have
a
little
better
chance
though
not
much
and
seem
to
me
to
be
worse
than
the
tufts
and
to
furnish
most
of
their
toadies
well
you
are
tired
of
my
railing
i
daresay
i
am
rabid
about
it
all
only
it
does
go
to
my
heart
to
think
what
this
place
might
be
and
what
it
is
i
see
i
need
give
you
any
more
of
my
experience
you
understand
now
some
of
the
things
that
have
puzzled
you
about
me
oh
i
know
they
did
you
need
look
apologetic
i
do
wonder
or
blame
you
i
am
a
very
queer
bird
for
the
perch
i
have
lit
on
i
know
that
as
well
as
anybody
the
only
wonder
is
that
you
ever
took
the
trouble
to
try
to
lime
me
now
have
another
glass
of
toddy
why
it
is
near
twelve
i
must
have
one
pipe
and
turn
in
no
aristophanes
chapter
ix
a
brown
bait
tom
little
exaltation
in
his
own
eyes
consequent
on
the
escapade
of
his
friend
was
not
to
last
long
not
a
week
had
elapsed
before
he
himself
arrived
suddenly
in
hardy
room
in
as
furious
a
state
of
mind
as
the
other
had
so
lately
been
in
allowing
for
the
difference
of
the
men
hardy
looked
up
from
his
books
and
exclaimed
what
the
matter
where
have
you
been
you
look
fierce
enough
to
sit
for
a
portrait
of
sanguinoso
volcanoni
the
bandit
been
said
tom
sitting
down
on
the
spare
windsor
chair
which
he
usually
occupied
so
hard
as
to
make
it
crack
again
been
i
been
to
a
wine
party
at
hendon
do
you
know
any
of
that
set
no
except
grey
who
came
into
residence
in
the
same
term
with
me
we
have
been
reading
for
degree
together
you
must
have
seen
him
here
sometimes
in
the
evenings
yes
i
remember
the
fellow
with
a
stiff
neck
who
wo
look
you
in
the
face
ay
but
he
is
a
sterling
man
at
the
bottom
i
can
tell
you
well
he
was
there
you
do
know
any
of
the
rest
no
and
never
went
to
any
of
their
parties
no
you
had
no
loss
i
can
tell
you
said
tom
pleased
that
the
ground
was
clear
for
him
i
never
was
amongst
such
a
set
of
waspish
dogmatical
fellows
in
my
life
why
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
have
they
been
doing
to
you
how
did
you
fall
among
such
philistines
i
such
an
easy
fool
you
see
said
tom
i
go
off
directly
with
any
fellow
that
asks
me
fast
or
slow
it
all
the
same
i
never
think
twice
about
the
matter
and
generally
i
like
all
the
fellows
i
meet
and
enjoy
everything
but
just
catch
me
at
another
of
their
wines
that
all
but
you
wo
tell
me
what
the
matter
well
i
do
know
why
hendon
should
have
asked
me
he
think
me
a
likely
card
for
a
convert
i
should
think
at
any
rate
he
asked
me
to
wine
and
i
went
as
usual
everything
was
in
capital
style
it
do
seem
to
be
any
part
of
their
creed
mind
you
to
drink
bad
wine
and
awfully
gentlemanly
and
decorous
yes
that
aggravating
i
admit
it
would
have
been
in
better
taste
of
course
if
they
had
been
a
little
blackguard
and
indecorous
no
doubt
too
one
has
a
right
to
expect
bad
wine
at
oxford
well
hardy
spoke
so
gravely
that
tom
had
to
look
across
at
him
for
half
a
minute
to
see
whether
he
was
in
earnest
then
he
went
on
with
a
grin
there
was
a
piano
in
one
corner
and
muslin
curtains
i
give
you
my
word
muslin
curtains
besides
the
stuff
ones
you
do
say
so
said
hardy
put
up
no
doubt
to
insult
you
no
wonder
you
looked
so
furious
when
you
came
in
anything
else
let
me
see
yes
i
counted
three
sorts
of
scents
on
the
besides
but
i
could
have
stood
it
well
enough
if
it
had
been
for
their
talk
from
one
thing
to
another
they
got
to
cathedrals
and
one
of
them
called
disgrace
to
a
christian
city
i
could
stand
that
you
know
i
was
always
bred
to
respect
paul
were
you
my
education
in
that
line
was
neglected
said
hardy
gravely
and
so
you
took
up
the
cudgels
for
st
paul
yes
i
plumped
out
that
paul
was
the
finest
cathedral
in
england
you
have
thought
i
had
said
that
lying
was
one
of
the
cardinal
virtues
one
or
two
just
treated
me
to
a
sort
of
pitying
sneer
but
my
neighbors
were
down
upon
me
with
a
vengeance
i
stuck
to
my
text
though
and
they
drove
me
into
saying
i
liked
the
ratcliffe
more
than
any
building
in
oxford
which
i
believe
i
do
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
so
when
they
get
me
to
budge
for
their
talk
they
took
to
telling
me
that
every
body
that
knew
anything
about
church
architecture
was
against
me
of
course
meaning
that
i
knew
nothing
about
it
for
the
matter
of
that
i
do
mean
to
say
that
i
do
tom
paused
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
some
reason
in
the
rough
handling
he
had
got
but
what
did
you
say
to
the
authorities
said
hardy
who
was
greatly
amused
said
i
did
care
a
straw
for
them
said
tom
there
was
no
right
or
wrong
in
the
matter
and
i
had
as
good
a
right
to
my
opinion
as
pugin
or
whatever
his
name
is
and
the
rest
what
heresy
said
hardy
laughing
you
caught
it
for
that
i
suppose
did
i
they
made
such
a
noise
over
it
that
the
men
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
stopped
talking
they
were
all
freshmen
at
our
end
and
when
they
found
what
was
up
one
of
the
older
ones
took
me
in
hand
and
i
got
a
lecture
about
the
middle
ages
and
the
monks
i
said
i
thought
england
was
well
rid
of
the
monks
and
then
we
got
on
to
protestantism
and
fasting
and
apostolic
succession
and
passive
obedience
and
i
do
know
what
all
i
only
know
i
was
tired
enough
of
it
before
the
coffee
came
but
i
could
go
you
know
with
all
of
them
on
me
at
once
could
i
of
course
not
you
were
like
the
unconquerable
british
infantry
at
albuera
you
held
your
position
by
sheer
fighting
suffering
fearful
loss
well
said
tom
laughing
for
he
had
talked
himself
into
good
humor
again
i
dare
say
i
talked
a
deal
of
nonsense
and
when
i
come
to
think
it
over
a
good
deal
of
what
some
of
them
said
had
something
in
it
i
should
like
to
hear
it
again
quietly
but
there
were
others
sneering
and
giving
themselves
airs
but
that
puts
a
fellow
back
up
yes
said
hardy
a
good
many
of
the
weakest
and
vainest
men
who
come
up
take
to
this
sort
of
thing
now
they
can
do
nothing
themselves
and
get
a
sort
of
platform
by
going
in
on
the
high
church
business
from
which
to
look
down
on
their
neighbors
that
just
what
i
thought
said
tom
they
tried
to
push
mother
church
mother
church
down
my
throat
at
every
turn
as
fond
of
the
church
as
any
of
them
but
i
do
want
to
be
jumping
up
on
her
back
every
minute
like
a
sickly
chicken
getting
on
the
old
hen
back
to
warm
its
feet
whenever
the
ground
is
cold
and
fancying
himself
taller
than
all
the
rest
of
the
brood
you
were
unlucky
said
hardy
there
are
some
very
fine
fellows
amongst
them
well
i
have
seen
much
of
them
said
tom
and
i
do
want
to
see
any
more
for
it
seems
to
be
all
gothic
mouldings
and
business
you
wo
think
so
when
you
been
up
a
little
longer
said
hardy
getting
up
to
make
tea
which
operation
he
had
hardly
commenced
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
and
in
answer
to
hardy
come
in
a
slight
shy
man
appeared
who
hesitated
and
seemed
inclined
to
go
when
he
saw
that
hardy
was
not
alone
oh
come
in
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
grey
you
know
brown
i
think
said
hardy
looking
round
from
the
fire
where
he
was
filling
his
teapot
to
watch
tom
reception
of
the
new
comer
our
hero
took
his
feet
down
drew
himself
up
and
made
a
solemn
bow
which
grey
returned
and
then
slid
nervously
into
a
chair
and
looked
very
uncomfortable
however
in
another
minute
hardy
came
to
the
rescue
and
began
pouring
out
the
tea
he
was
evidently
tickled
at
the
idea
of
confronting
tom
so
soon
with
another
of
his
enemies
tom
saw
this
and
put
on
a
cool
and
majestic
manner
in
consequence
which
evidently
increased
the
discomfort
of
grey
seat
and
kept
hardy
on
the
edge
of
an
abyss
of
laughter
in
fact
he
had
to
ease
himself
by
talking
of
indifferent
matters
and
laughing
at
nothing
tom
had
never
seen
him
in
this
sort
of
humor
before
and
could
help
enjoying
it
though
he
felt
that
it
was
partly
at
his
own
expense
but
when
hardy
once
just
approached
the
subject
of
the
wine
party
tom
bristled
up
so
quickly
and
grey
looked
so
meekly
wretched
though
he
knew
nothing
of
what
was
coming
that
hardy
suddenly
changed
the
subject
and
turning
to
grey
said
what
have
you
been
doing
the
last
fortnight
you
have
been
here
once
i
been
obliged
to
get
on
with
my
aristotle
without
you
i
very
sorry
indeed
but
i
have
been
able
to
come
said
grey
looking
sideways
at
hardy
and
then
at
tom
who
sat
regarding
the
wall
supremely
indifferent
well
i
finished
my
ethics
said
hardy
ca
you
come
in
night
to
talk
them
over
i
suppose
you
through
them
too
no
really
said
grey
i
have
been
able
to
look
at
them
since
the
last
time
i
was
here
you
must
take
care
said
hardy
the
new
examiners
are
all
for
science
and
history
it
wo
do
for
you
to
go
in
trusting
to
your
scholarship
i
hope
to
make
it
up
in
the
easter
vacation
said
grey
have
enough
to
do
then
said
hardy
but
how
is
it
dropped
astern
so
why
the
fact
is
said
grey
hesitatingly
that
the
curate
of
peter
has
set
up
some
night
schools
and
wanted
some
help
so
i
have
been
doing
what
i
could
to
help
him
and
really
looking
at
his
watch
i
must
be
going
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
how
it
was
i
did
come
now
hardy
looked
at
tom
who
was
rather
taken
aback
by
this
announcement
and
began
to
look
less
haughtily
at
the
wall
he
even
condescended
to
take
a
short
glance
at
his
neighbor
it
unlucky
said
hardy
but
do
you
teach
every
night
yes
said
grey
i
used
to
do
my
science
and
history
at
night
you
know
but
i
find
that
teaching
takes
so
much
out
of
me
that
i
only
fit
for
bed
now
when
i
get
back
i
so
glad
i
told
you
i
have
wanted
to
do
it
for
some
time
and
if
you
would
let
me
come
in
for
an
hour
directly
after
hall
instead
of
later
i
think
i
could
still
manage
that
of
course
said
hardy
come
when
you
like
but
it
rather
hard
to
take
you
away
every
night
so
near
the
examinations
it
is
my
own
wish
said
grey
i
should
have
been
very
glad
if
it
had
happened
just
now
but
as
it
has
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
well
but
i
should
like
to
help
you
ca
i
take
a
night
or
two
off
your
hands
no
said
tom
fired
with
sudden
enthusiasm
it
will
be
as
bad
for
you
hardy
it
ca
want
much
scholarship
to
teach
there
let
me
go
i
take
two
nights
a
week
if
you
let
me
oh
thank
you
said
grey
but
i
do
know
how
my
friend
might
like
it
that
is
i
mean
he
said
getting
very
red
it
very
kind
of
you
only
i
used
to
it
and
and
they
rely
on
me
but
i
really
must
go
good
night
and
grey
went
off
in
confusion
as
soon
as
the
door
had
fairly
closed
hardy
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
laughing
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
tom
wholly
unable
to
appreciate
the
joke
sat
looking
at
him
with
perfect
gravity
what
can
there
be
in
your
look
brown
said
hardy
when
he
could
speak
again
to
frighten
grey
so
did
you
see
what
a
fright
he
was
in
at
once
at
the
idea
of
turning
you
into
the
night
schools
there
must
be
some
lurking
protestantism
in
your
face
somewhere
which
i
had
detected
i
do
believe
he
was
frightened
at
me
a
bit
he
would
have
you
either
remember
said
tom
well
at
any
rate
that
does
look
as
if
it
were
all
mere
and
does
it
said
hardy
tom
sipped
his
tea
and
considered
one
ca
help
admiring
him
do
you
know
for
it
he
said
do
you
think
he
is
really
thrown
back
now
in
his
own
reading
by
this
teaching
i
sure
of
it
he
is
such
a
quiet
fellow
that
nothing
else
is
likely
to
draw
him
off
reading
i
can
see
that
he
does
get
on
as
he
used
day
by
day
unless
he
makes
it
up
somehow
he
get
his
first
he
do
seem
to
like
the
teaching
work
much
said
tom
not
at
all
so
far
as
i
can
see
then
it
is
a
very
fine
thing
of
him
said
tom
and
you
retract
your
dictum
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
yes
that
i
do
heartily
but
not
as
to
the
set
in
general
well
they
do
suit
me
either
but
on
the
whole
they
are
wanted
at
any
rate
in
this
college
even
the
worst
of
them
is
making
some
sort
of
protest
for
and
against
which
is
nowhere
more
needed
than
here
a
nice
sort
of
protest
muslin
curtains
a
piano
and
old
claret
oh
you
no
right
to
count
henden
among
them
he
has
only
a
little
hankering
after
mediaevalism
and
thinks
the
whole
thing
gentlemanly
i
only
know
the
whole
clamjamfery
of
them
were
there
and
seem
to
protest
much
brown
you
a
bigot
i
should
never
have
thought
you
would
have
been
so
furious
against
any
set
of
fellows
i
begin
to
smell
arnold
no
you
do
he
never
spoke
to
me
against
anybody
hallo
it
was
the
rugby
atmosphere
then
i
suppose
but
i
tell
you
they
are
the
only
men
in
the
college
who
are
making
that
protest
whatever
their
motives
may
be
what
do
you
say
to
yourself
old
fellow
nonsense
i
never
deny
myself
any
pleasure
that
i
can
afford
if
it
is
wrong
in
itself
and
does
hinder
anyone
else
i
can
tell
you
i
am
as
fond
of
fine
things
and
good
living
as
you
if
a
thing
is
wrong
and
you
can
afford
it
and
it
hurt
anybody
just
so
well
then
must
it
be
right
for
you
to
have
you
would
have
it
put
under
your
nose
i
suppose
just
for
you
to
smell
at
and
let
it
alone
yes
i
know
all
that
i
been
over
it
often
enough
and
there
truth
in
it
but
mind
you
it
rather
slippery
ground
especially
for
a
freshman
and
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
the
other
side
i
mean
for
denying
oneself
just
for
the
sake
of
the
self
denial
well
they
do
deny
themselves
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
a
fellow
as
if
he
were
a
turk
because
he
likes
paul
better
than
westminster
abbey
how
that
snubbing
you
got
at
the
ecclesiological
wine
party
seems
to
there
now
do
bristle
up
like
a
hedgehog
i
never
mention
that
unfortunate
wine
again
i
saw
the
eight
come
in
you
were
keeping
much
better
time
but
there
is
a
weak
place
or
two
forward
yes
said
tom
delighted
to
change
the
subject
i
find
it
awfully
hard
to
pull
up
to
jervis
stroke
do
you
think
i
shall
ever
get
to
it
of
course
you
will
why
you
have
only
been
pulling
behind
him
a
dozen
times
or
so
and
his
is
the
most
trying
stroke
on
the
river
you
quicken
a
little
on
it
but
i
did
mean
you
two
and
five
are
the
blots
in
the
boat
you
think
so
said
tom
much
relieved
so
does
miller
i
can
see
it
so
provoking
drysdale
is
to
pull
two
in
the
races
next
term
and
blake
seven
and
then
diogenes
will
go
to
five
obliged
to
pull
seven
now
because
blake
wo
come
down
this
term
no
more
will
drysdale
they
say
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
after
easter
it
a
great
pity
said
hardy
is
it
said
tom
and
it
makes
miller
so
savage
he
walks
into
us
all
as
if
it
were
our
faults
do
you
think
he
a
good
coxswain
first
rate
on
most
points
but
rather
too
sharp
tongued
you
ca
get
a
man
best
out
of
him
without
a
little
praise
yes
that
just
it
he
puts
one
back
up
said
tom
but
the
captain
is
a
splendid
fellow
is
he
yes
but
a
little
too
easy
at
least
with
men
like
blake
and
drysdale
he
ought
to
make
them
train
or
turn
them
out
but
who
could
he
get
there
nobody
else
if
you
would
pull
now
why
should
you
i
sure
it
would
make
us
all
right
i
do
subscribe
to
the
club
said
hardy
i
wish
i
had
for
i
should
have
liked
to
have
pulled
with
you
and
behind
jervis
this
year
do
let
me
tell
the
captain
said
tom
i
sure
he
manage
it
somehow
i
afraid
it
too
late
said
hardy
i
cut
myself
off
from
everything
of
the
sort
two
years
ago
and
i
beginning
to
think
i
was
a
fool
for
my
pains
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
subject
at
the
time
but
tom
went
away
in
great
spirits
at
having
drawn
this
confession
out
of
hardy
the
more
so
perhaps
because
he
flattered
himself
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
the
change
in
his
friend
chapter
x
summer
term
how
many
spots
in
life
are
there
which
will
bear
comparison
with
the
beginning
of
our
second
term
at
the
university
so
far
as
external
circumstances
are
concerned
it
seems
hard
to
know
what
a
man
could
find
to
ask
for
at
that
period
of
his
life
if
a
fairy
godmother
were
to
alight
in
his
rooms
and
offer
him
the
usual
three
wishes
the
sailor
who
had
asked
for
all
the
grog
in
the
world
and
all
the
baccy
in
the
world
was
indeed
driven
to
a
little
more
baccy
as
his
third
requisition
but
at
any
rate
his
two
first
requisitions
were
to
some
extent
grounded
on
what
he
held
to
be
substantial
wants
he
felt
himself
actually
limited
in
the
matters
of
grog
and
tobacco
the
condition
which
jack
would
have
been
in
as
a
wisher
if
he
had
been
started
on
his
quest
with
the
assurance
that
his
utmost
desires
in
the
direction
of
alcohol
and
narcotic
were
already
provided
for
and
must
be
left
out
of
the
question
is
the
only
one
affording
a
pretty
exact
parallel
to
the
case
we
are
considering
in
our
second
term
we
are
no
longer
freshmen
and
begin
to
feel
ourselves
at
home
while
both
smalls
and
greats
are
sufficiently
distant
to
be
altogether
ignored
if
we
are
that
way
inclined
or
to
be
looked
forward
to
with
confidence
that
the
game
is
in
our
own
hands
if
we
are
reading
men
our
financial
position
unless
we
have
exercised
rare
ingenuity
in
involving
ourselves
is
all
that
heart
can
desire
we
have
ample
allowances
paid
in
quarterly
to
the
university
bankers
without
thought
or
trouble
of
ours
and
our
credit
is
at
its
zenith
it
is
a
part
of
our
recognized
duty
to
repay
the
hospitality
we
have
received
as
freshmen
and
all
men
will
be
sure
to
come
to
our
first
parties
to
see
how
we
do
the
thing
it
will
be
our
own
faults
if
we
do
not
keep
them
in
future
we
have
not
had
time
to
injure
our
characters
to
any
material
extent
with
the
authorities
of
our
own
college
or
of
the
university
our
spirits
are
never
likely
to
be
higher
or
our
digestions
better
these
and
many
other
comforts
and
advantages
environ
the
fortunate
youth
returning
to
oxford
after
his
first
vacation
thrice
fortunate
however
if
as
happened
in
our
hero
case
it
is
easter
term
to
which
he
is
returning
for
that
easter
term
with
the
four
days
vacation
and
the
little
trinity
term
at
the
end
of
it
is
surely
the
cream
of
the
oxford
year
then
even
in
this
our
stern
northern
climate
the
sun
is
beginning
to
have
power
the
days
have
lengthened
out
are
unnecessary
at
morning
chapel
and
the
miseries
of
numbed
hands
and
shivering
skins
no
longer
accompany
every
pull
on
the
river
and
canter
on
bullingdon
in
christ
church
meadows
and
the
college
gardens
the
birds
are
making
sweet
music
in
the
tall
elms
you
may
almost
hear
the
thick
grass
growing
and
the
buds
on
tree
and
shrub
are
changing
from
brown
red
or
purple
to
emerald
green
under
your
eyes
the
glorious
old
city
is
putting
on
her
best
looks
and
bursting
into
laughter
and
song
in
a
few
weeks
the
races
begin
and
cowley
marsh
will
be
alive
with
white
tents
and
joyous
cricketers
a
quick
ear
on
the
by
the
gut
may
feast
at
one
time
on
those
three
sweet
sounds
the
thud
thud
of
the
the
crack
of
the
rifles
at
the
weirs
and
the
click
of
the
bat
on
the
magdalen
ground
and
then
commemoration
rises
in
the
background
with
its
clouds
of
fair
visitors
and
visions
of
excursions
to
woodstock
and
nuneham
in
the
summer
days
of
windows
open
on
to
the
old
quadrangles
in
the
long
still
evenings
through
which
silver
laughter
and
strains
of
sweet
music
not
made
by
man
steal
out
and
puzzle
the
old
celibate
jackdaws
peering
down
from
the
battlements
with
heads
on
one
side
to
crown
all
long
vacation
beginning
with
the
run
to
henley
regatta
or
up
to
town
to
see
the
match
with
cambridge
at
lord
and
taste
some
of
the
sweets
of
the
season
before
starting
on
some
pleasure
tour
or
reading
party
or
dropping
back
into
the
quiet
pleasures
of
english
country
life
surely
the
lot
of
young
englishmen
who
frequent
our
universities
is
cast
in
pleasant
places
the
country
has
a
right
to
expect
something
from
those
for
whom
she
finds
such
a
life
as
this
in
the
years
when
enjoyment
is
keenest
tom
was
certainly
alive
to
the
advantages
of
the
situation
and
entered
on
his
kingdom
without
any
kind
of
scruple
he
was
very
glad
to
find
things
so
pleasant
and
quite
resolved
to
make
the
best
he
could
of
them
then
he
was
in
a
particularly
good
humour
with
himself
for
in
deference
to
the
advice
of
hardy
he
had
actually
fixed
on
the
books
which
he
should
send
in
for
his
examination
before
going
down
for
the
easter
vacation
and
had
read
them
through
at
home
devoting
an
hour
or
two
almost
daily
to
this
laudable
occupation
so
he
felt
himself
entitled
to
take
things
easily
on
his
return
he
had
brought
back
with
him
two
large
hampers
of
good
sound
wine
a
gift
from
his
father
who
had
a
horror
of
letting
his
son
set
before
his
friends
the
which
is
generally
sold
to
the
undergraduate
tom
found
that
his
father
notions
of
the
rate
of
consumption
prevalent
in
the
university
were
wild
in
the
extreme
in
his
time
the
squire
said
eleven
men
came
to
his
first
wine
party
and
he
had
opened
nineteen
bottles
of
port
for
them
he
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
the
habits
of
the
place
had
changed
so
much
for
the
better
and
as
tom
would
want
nearly
so
much
wine
he
should
have
it
out
of
an
older
bin
accordingly
the
port
which
tom
employed
the
first
hour
after
his
return
in
stacking
carefully
away
in
his
cellar
had
been
more
than
twelve
years
in
bottle
and
he
thought
with
unmixed
satisfaction
of
the
pleasing
effect
it
would
have
on
jervis
and
miller
and
the
one
or
two
other
men
who
knew
good
wine
from
bad
and
guided
public
opinion
on
the
subject
and
of
the
social
importance
which
he
would
soon
attain
from
the
reputation
of
giving
good
wine
the
idea
of
entertaining
of
being
hospitable
is
a
pleasant
and
fascinating
one
to
most
young
men
but
the
act
soon
gets
to
be
a
bore
to
all
but
a
few
curiously
constituted
individuals
with
these
hospitality
becomes
first
a
passion
and
then
a
faith
a
faith
the
practice
of
which
in
the
cases
of
some
of
its
professors
reminds
one
strongly
of
the
hints
on
such
subjects
scattered
about
the
new
testament
most
of
us
feel
when
our
friends
leave
us
a
certain
sort
of
satisfaction
not
unlike
that
of
paying
a
bill
they
have
been
done
for
and
ca
expect
anything
more
for
a
long
time
such
thoughts
never
occur
to
your
really
hospitable
man
long
years
of
narrow
means
can
not
hinder
him
from
keeping
open
house
for
whoever
wants
to
come
to
him
and
setting
the
best
of
everything
before
all
comers
he
has
no
notion
of
giving
you
anything
but
the
best
he
can
command
if
it
be
only
fresh
porter
from
the
nearest
mews
he
asks
himself
not
ought
i
to
invite
a
or
b
do
i
owe
him
anything
but
would
a
or
b
like
to
come
here
give
me
these
men
houses
for
real
enjoyment
though
you
never
get
anything
very
choice
there
how
can
a
man
produce
old
wine
who
gives
his
oldest
every
day
seldom
much
elbow
room
or
orderly
arrangement
the
high
arts
of
gastronomy
and
scientific
drinking
so
much
valued
in
our
highly
civilized
community
are
wholly
unheeded
by
him
are
altogether
above
him
are
cultivated
in
fact
by
quite
another
set
who
have
very
little
of
the
genuine
spirit
of
hospitality
in
them
from
those
tables
should
one
by
chance
happen
upon
them
one
senses
certainly
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
and
expansion
chiefly
physical
but
entirely
without
the
expansion
of
heart
which
one
gets
at
the
scramble
of
the
hospitable
man
so
that
we
are
driven
to
remark
even
in
such
everyday
matters
as
these
but
it
is
the
invisible
the
spiritual
which
after
all
gives
value
and
reality
even
to
dinners
and
with
solomon
to
prefer
the
most
touching
the
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
though
i
trust
that
neither
we
nor
solomon
should
object
to
cutlets
with
our
salad
if
they
happened
to
be
going
readers
will
scarcely
need
to
be
told
that
one
of
the
first
things
tom
did
after
depositing
his
luggage
and
unpacking
his
wine
was
to
call
at
hardy
rooms
where
he
found
his
friend
deep
as
usual
in
his
books
the
atlases
and
dictionaries
of
all
sorts
taking
up
more
space
than
ever
after
the
first
hearty
greeting
tom
occupied
his
old
place
with
much
satisfaction
how
long
have
you
been
up
old
fellow
he
began
you
look
quite
settled
i
only
went
home
for
a
week
well
what
have
you
been
doing
in
the
vacation
oh
there
was
nothing
much
going
on
so
amongst
other
things
i
nearly
floored
my
work
bravo
you
find
the
comfort
of
it
now
i
hardly
thought
you
would
take
to
the
grind
so
easily
it
pleasant
enough
for
a
spurt
said
tom
but
i
shall
never
manage
a
horrid
perpetual
grind
like
yours
but
what
in
the
world
have
you
been
doing
to
your
walls
tom
might
well
ask
for
the
corners
of
hardy
room
were
covered
with
sheets
of
paper
of
different
sizes
pasted
against
the
wall
in
groups
in
the
line
of
sight
from
about
the
height
of
four
to
six
feet
there
was
scarcely
an
inch
of
the
original
paper
visible
and
round
each
centre
group
there
were
outlying
patches
and
streamers
stretching
towards
floor
or
ceiling
or
away
nearly
to
the
bookcases
or
fireplace
well
do
you
think
it
is
a
great
improvement
on
the
old
paper
said
hardy
i
shall
be
out
of
rooms
next
term
and
it
will
be
a
hint
to
the
college
that
the
rooms
want
papering
you
no
judge
of
such
matters
or
i
should
ask
you
whether
you
do
see
great
artistic
taste
in
the
arrangement
why
they
nothing
but
maps
and
lists
of
names
and
dates
said
tom
who
had
got
up
to
examine
the
decorations
and
what
in
the
world
are
all
these
queer
pins
for
he
went
on
pulling
a
strong
pin
with
a
large
red
head
out
of
the
map
nearest
to
him
hullo
take
care
there
what
are
you
about
shouted
hardy
getting
up
and
hastening
to
the
corner
why
you
irreverent
beggar
those
pins
are
the
famous
statesmen
and
warriors
of
greece
and
rome
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
know
i
was
in
such
august
company
saying
which
tom
proceeded
to
stick
the
pin
back
in
the
wall
now
just
look
at
that
said
hardy
taking
the
pin
out
from
the
place
where
tom
had
stuck
it
pretty
doings
there
would
be
amongst
them
with
your
management
this
pin
is
brasidas
taken
him
away
from
naupactus
where
he
was
watching
the
eleven
athenian
galleys
anchored
under
the
temple
of
apollo
and
struck
him
down
right
in
the
middle
of
the
pnyx
where
he
will
be
instantly
torn
in
pieces
by
a
ruthless
and
reckless
mob
you
call
yourself
a
tory
indeed
however
was
always
the
same
with
you
tories
calculating
cruel
and
jealous
use
your
leaders
up
and
throw
them
over
that
the
golden
rule
of
aristocracies
hang
brasidas
said
tom
laughing
stick
him
back
at
naupactus
again
here
which
is
cleon
the
scoundrel
give
me
hold
of
him
and
i
put
him
in
a
hot
berth
that
he
with
the
yellow
head
let
him
alone
i
tell
you
or
all
will
be
hopeless
confusion
when
grey
comes
for
his
lecture
we
only
in
the
third
year
of
the
war
i
like
your
chaff
about
tories
sacrificing
their
great
men
said
tom
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
to
avoid
temptation
how
about
your
precious
democracy
old
fellow
which
is
socrates
here
the
dear
old
boy
this
pin
with
the
great
grey
head
in
the
middle
of
athens
you
see
i
pride
myself
on
my
athens
here
the
piraeus
and
the
long
walls
and
the
hill
of
mars
is
it
as
good
as
a
picture
well
it
is
better
than
most
maps
i
think
said
tom
but
you
not
going
to
slip
out
so
easily
i
want
to
know
whether
your
pet
democracy
did
or
did
not
murder
socrates
i
not
bound
to
defend
democracies
but
look
at
my
pins
it
may
be
the
natural
fondness
of
a
parent
but
i
declare
they
seem
to
me
to
have
a
great
deal
of
character
considering
the
material
you
guess
them
at
once
i
sure
if
you
mark
the
color
and
shape
of
the
wax
this
one
now
for
instance
who
is
he
alcibiades
answered
tom
doubtfully
alcibiades
shouted
hardy
you
fresh
from
rugby
and
not
know
your
thucydides
better
than
that
there
alcibiades
that
little
foppish
pin
by
socrates
this
one
is
that
respectable
old
nicias
well
but
you
made
alcibiades
nearly
the
smallest
of
the
whole
lot
said
tom
so
he
was
to
my
mind
said
hardy
just
the
sort
of
insolent
young
ruffian
whom
i
should
have
liked
to
buy
at
my
price
and
sell
at
his
own
he
must
have
been
very
like
some
of
our
with
the
addition
of
brains
i
should
really
think
though
said
tom
it
must
be
a
capital
plan
for
making
you
remember
the
history
it
is
i
flatter
myself
i
long
had
the
idea
but
i
should
never
have
worked
it
out
and
found
the
value
of
it
but
for
grey
i
invented
it
to
coach
him
in
his
history
you
see
we
are
in
the
grecian
corner
over
there
is
the
roman
you
find
livy
and
tacitus
worked
out
there
just
as
herodotus
and
thucydides
are
here
and
the
pins
are
stuck
for
the
second
punic
war
where
we
are
just
now
i
should
wonder
if
grey
got
his
first
after
all
he
picking
up
so
quick
in
my
corners
and
says
he
never
forgets
any
set
of
events
when
he
has
picked
them
out
with
the
pins
is
he
working
at
that
school
still
asked
tom
yes
as
hard
as
ever
he
did
go
down
for
the
vacation
and
i
really
believe
it
was
because
the
curate
told
him
the
school
would
go
wrong
if
he
went
away
it
very
plucky
of
him
but
i
do
think
he
a
great
fool
not
to
knock
it
off
now
till
he
has
passed
do
you
no
said
hardy
he
is
getting
more
good
there
than
he
can
ever
get
in
the
schools
though
i
hope
he
do
well
in
them
too
well
i
hope
so
for
he
deserves
it
and
now
hardy
to
change
the
subject
i
am
going
to
give
my
first
wine
next
thursday
and
here
the
first
card
which
has
gone
out
for
it
you
promise
me
to
come
now
wo
you
what
a
hurry
you
in
said
hardy
taking
the
card
which
he
put
on
his
after
examining
it
but
you
promise
to
come
now
i
very
hard
at
work
i
ca
be
sure
you
need
stay
above
half
an
hour
i
brought
back
some
famous
wine
from
the
governor
cellar
and
i
want
so
to
get
you
and
jervis
together
he
is
sure
to
come
why
that
the
bell
for
chapel
beginning
already
said
hardy
i
had
no
notion
it
was
so
late
i
must
be
off
to
put
the
new
servitor
up
to
his
work
will
you
come
in
after
hall
yes
if
you
will
come
to
me
next
thursday
we
talk
about
it
but
mind
you
come
for
you
find
me
working
grey
in
the
punic
wars
and
you
see
how
the
pins
act
i
very
proud
of
my
show
and
so
hardy
went
off
to
chapel
and
tom
to
drysdale
rooms
not
at
all
satisfied
that
he
had
made
hardy
safe
he
found
drysdale
lolling
on
his
sofa
as
usual
and
fondling
jack
he
had
just
arrived
and
his
servant
and
the
scout
were
unpacking
his
portmanteaus
he
seemed
pleased
to
see
tom
but
looked
languid
and
used
up
where
have
you
been
this
vacation
said
tom
you
look
seedy
you
may
say
that
said
drysdale
here
henry
get
out
a
bottle
of
schiedam
have
a
taste
of
bitters
there
nothing
like
it
to
set
one
digestion
right
no
said
tom
rejecting
the
glass
which
henry
proffered
him
my
appetite
do
want
improving
you
lucky
then
said
drysdale
ah
that
the
right
stuff
i
feel
better
already
but
where
have
you
been
oh
in
the
little
village
it
no
use
being
in
the
country
at
this
time
of
year
i
just
went
up
to
limmer
and
there
i
stuck
with
two
or
three
more
till
i
ca
stand
london
for
more
than
a
week
said
tom
what
did
you
do
all
the
day
we
had
much
to
say
to
said
drysdale
what
with
theatres
and
and
the
and
and
a
little
play
in
james
street
now
and
then
one
up
to
early
rising
however
i
was
better
than
the
rest
for
i
had
generally
breakfasted
by
two
no
wonder
you
look
seedy
you
much
better
have
been
in
the
country
i
should
have
been
more
in
pocket
at
any
rate
said
drysdale
by
jove
how
it
runs
away
with
the
ready
i
fairly
cleaned
out
and
if
i
have
luck
at
van
john
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
how
i
to
get
through
term
but
look
here
here
a
bundle
of
the
newest
songs
first
rate
some
of
them
and
he
threw
some
papers
across
to
tom
who
glanced
at
them
without
being
at
all
edified
you
going
to
pull
regularly
i
hope
this
term
drysdale
yes
i
think
so
it
cheap
amusement
and
i
want
a
little
training
for
a
change
that
all
right
i
brought
down
some
dresses
for
our
gipsy
business
by
the
way
i
did
forget
that
is
blake
back
i
do
know
said
tom
but
we
sha
have
time
before
the
races
well
afterwards
will
do
though
the
days
ought
to
be
too
long
i
all
for
a
little
darkness
in
masquerading
there
five
striking
are
you
going
to
dine
in
hall
no
i
shall
go
to
the
mitre
and
get
a
broil
then
i
off
let
see
will
you
come
and
wine
with
me
next
thursday
yes
only
send
us
a
card
remind
all
right
said
tom
and
went
off
to
hall
feeling
dissatisfied
and
uncomfortable
about
his
fast
friend
for
whom
he
had
a
sincere
regard
after
hall
tom
made
a
short
round
amongst
his
acquaintance
and
then
giving
himself
up
to
the
strongest
attraction
returned
to
hardy
rooms
comforting
himself
with
the
thought
that
it
really
must
be
an
act
of
christian
charity
to
take
such
a
terrible
reader
off
his
books
for
once
in
a
way
when
his
conscience
pricked
him
for
intruding
on
hardy
during
his
hours
of
work
he
found
grey
there
who
was
getting
up
his
roman
history
under
hardy
guidance
and
the
two
were
working
the
pins
on
the
maps
and
lists
in
the
roman
corner
when
tom
arrived
he
begged
them
not
to
stop
and
very
soon
was
as
much
interested
in
what
they
were
doing
as
if
he
also
were
going
into
the
schools
in
may
for
hardy
had
a
way
of
throwing
life
into
what
he
was
talking
about
and
like
many
men
with
strong
opinions
and
passionate
natures
either
carried
his
hearers
off
their
legs
and
away
with
him
altogether
or
aroused
every
spark
of
combativeness
in
them
the
latter
was
the
effect
which
his
lecture
on
the
punic
wars
had
on
tom
he
made
several
protests
as
hardy
went
on
but
anxious
looks
kept
him
from
going
fairly
into
action
till
hardy
stuck
the
black
pin
which
represented
scipio
triumphantly
in
the
middle
of
carthage
and
turning
round
said
and
now
for
some
tea
grey
before
you
have
to
turn
out
tom
opened
fire
while
the
tea
was
brewing
you
could
say
anything
bad
enough
about
aristocracies
this
morning
hardy
and
now
you
are
crowing
over
the
success
of
the
heaviest
and
cruelest
oligarchy
that
ever
lived
and
praising
them
up
to
the
skies
hullo
here
a
breeze
said
hardy
smiling
but
i
rejoice
o
brown
in
that
they
thrashed
the
carthaginians
and
not
as
you
seem
to
think
in
that
they
being
aristocrats
thrashed
the
carthaginians
for
oligarchs
they
were
not
at
this
time
at
any
rate
they
answer
to
the
spartans
in
the
struggle
and
the
carthaginians
to
the
athenians
and
yet
all
your
sympathies
are
with
the
romans
in
the
punic
wars
though
they
were
with
the
athenians
before
dinner
i
deny
your
position
the
carthaginians
were
nothing
but
a
great
trading
aristocracy
with
a
glorious
family
or
two
i
grant
you
like
that
of
hannibal
but
on
the
whole
a
dirty
aristocracy
of
whom
the
world
was
well
rid
they
like
the
athenians
indeed
why
just
look
what
the
two
people
have
left
behind
yes
interrupted
tom
but
we
only
know
the
carthaginians
through
the
reports
of
their
destroyers
your
heroes
trampled
them
out
with
hoofs
of
iron
do
you
think
the
roman
hoof
could
have
trampled
out
their
homer
if
they
ever
had
one
said
hardy
the
romans
conquered
greece
too
remember
but
greece
was
never
so
near
beating
them
true
but
i
hold
to
my
point
carthage
was
the
mother
of
all
huxters
compassing
sea
and
land
to
sell
her
wares
and
no
bad
line
of
life
for
a
nation
at
least
englishmen
ought
to
think
so
no
they
ought
not
at
least
if
is
to
be
the
rule
of
trade
selling
any
amount
of
brummagem
wares
never
did
nation
or
man
much
good
and
never
will
eh
grey
grey
winced
at
being
appealed
to
but
remarked
that
he
hoped
the
church
would
yet
be
able
to
save
england
from
the
fate
of
tyre
or
carthage
the
great
trading
nations
of
the
old
world
and
then
swallowing
his
tea
and
looking
as
if
he
had
been
caught
robbing
a
henroost
he
made
a
sudden
exit
and
hurried
away
out
of
college
to
the
night
school
what
a
pity
he
is
so
odd
and
shy
said
tom
i
should
so
like
to
know
more
of
him
it
a
pity
he
is
much
better
when
he
is
alone
with
me
i
think
he
has
heard
from
some
of
the
set
that
you
are
a
furious
protestant
and
sees
an
immense
amount
of
in
you
but
about
england
and
carthage
said
tom
shirking
the
subject
of
his
own
peculiarities
you
do
really
think
us
like
them
it
gave
me
a
turn
to
hear
you
translating
fides
into
brummagem
wares
just
now
i
think
that
successful
trade
is
our
rock
ahead
the
devil
who
holds
new
markets
and
twenty
per
cent
profits
in
his
gift
is
the
devil
that
england
has
most
to
fear
from
of
unrighteous
dealings
and
riches
gotten
by
deceit
the
kingdom
is
translated
from
one
people
to
another
said
the
wise
man
think
of
that
opium
war
the
other
day
i
do
believe
we
can
get
over
many
more
such
businesses
as
that
grey
falls
back
on
the
church
you
see
to
save
the
nation
but
the
church
he
dreams
of
will
never
do
it
is
there
any
that
can
there
be
surely
or
we
have
believed
a
lie
but
this
work
of
making
trade
righteous
of
christianizing
trade
looks
like
the
very
hardest
the
gospel
has
ever
had
to
take
in
hand
in
england
at
any
rate
hardy
spoke
slowly
and
doubtfully
and
paused
as
if
asking
for
tom
opinion
i
never
heard
it
put
in
that
way
i
know
very
little
of
politics
or
the
state
of
england
but
come
now
the
putting
down
the
and
compensating
our
planters
shows
that
we
are
not
sold
to
the
trade
devil
yet
surely
i
do
think
we
are
no
thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
signs
that
we
are
likely
to
make
a
good
fight
of
it
yet
they
talked
together
for
another
hour
drawing
their
chairs
round
to
the
fire
and
looking
dreamingly
into
the
embers
as
is
the
wont
of
men
who
are
throwing
out
suggestions
and
helping
one
another
to
think
rather
than
arguing
at
the
end
of
that
time
tom
left
hardy
to
his
books
and
went
away
laden
with
several
new
ideas
one
of
the
clearest
of
which
was
that
he
was
awfully
ignorant
of
the
contemporary
history
of
his
own
country
and
that
it
was
the
thing
of
all
others
which
he
ought
to
be
best
informed
on
and
thinking
most
about
so
being
of
an
impetuous
turn
of
mind
he
went
straight
to
his
rooms
to
commence
his
new
study
where
after
diligent
hunting
the
only
food
of
the
kind
he
required
which
turned
up
was
the
last
number
of
from
the
pocket
of
his
great
coat
upon
this
he
fell
to
work
in
default
of
anything
better
and
was
soon
deep
in
the
column
which
was
full
of
interesting
speculations
as
to
the
chances
of
bungaree
in
his
forthcoming
campaign
against
the
british
middleweights
by
the
time
he
had
skimmed
through
the
sheets
he
was
satisfied
that
the
columns
of
his
old
acquaintance
were
not
the
place
except
in
the
police
reports
where
much
could
be
learnt
about
the
present
state
or
future
prospects
of
england
then
the
first
evening
of
term
being
a
restless
place
he
wandered
out
again
and
before
long
landed
as
his
custom
was
at
drysdale
door
on
entering
the
room
he
found
drysdale
and
blake
alone
together
the
former
looking
more
serious
than
tom
had
ever
seen
him
before
as
for
blake
the
restless
haggard
expression
sat
more
heavily
than
ever
on
his
face
sadly
marring
its
beauty
it
was
clear
that
they
changed
the
subject
of
their
talk
abruptly
on
his
entrance
so
tom
looked
anywhere
except
straight
before
him
as
he
was
greeting
blake
he
really
felt
very
sorry
for
him
at
the
moment
however
in
another
five
minutes
he
was
in
fits
of
laughter
over
blake
description
of
the
conversation
between
himself
and
the
coachman
who
had
driven
the
by
which
he
had
come
up
in
which
conversation
nevertheless
when
tom
came
to
think
it
over
and
try
to
repeat
it
afterwards
the
most
facetious
parts
seemed
to
be
the
sez
he
and
the
sez
i
with
which
jehu
larded
his
stories
so
he
gave
up
the
attempt
wondering
what
he
could
have
found
in
it
to
laugh
at
by
the
way
blake
said
drysdale
how
about
our
excursion
into
berkshire
masquerading
this
term
are
you
game
not
exactly
said
blake
i
really
must
make
the
most
of
such
time
as
i
have
left
if
i
going
into
the
schools
this
term
if
there
one
thing
which
spoils
oxford
it
is
those
schools
said
drysdale
they
get
in
the
way
of
everything
i
ought
to
be
going
up
for
smalls
myself
next
term
and
i
have
opened
a
book
yet
and
do
mean
to
do
so
follow
a
good
example
old
fellow
you
of
your
first
knows
i
wish
everybody
would
back
his
opinion
and
give
me
a
shade
of
odds
why
i
have
scarcely
thought
of
my
history
why
the
d
should
they
make
such
a
fuss
about
history
one
knows
perfectly
well
that
those
old
heathens
were
no
better
than
they
should
be
and
what
good
it
can
do
to
lumber
one
head
with
who
their
grandmothers
were
and
what
they
ate
and
when
and
where
and
why
they
had
their
stupid
brains
knocked
out
i
ca
see
for
the
life
of
me
excellently
well
put
where
did
you
pick
up
such
sound
views
drysdale
but
you
not
examiner
yet
and
on
the
whole
i
must
rub
up
my
history
somehow
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
do
it
ca
you
put
on
a
coach
said
drysdale
i
have
one
on
but
history
is
my
weak
point
said
blake
i
think
i
can
help
you
said
tom
i
just
been
hearing
a
lecture
in
roman
history
and
one
that
wo
be
so
easy
to
forget
as
most
and
he
went
on
to
explain
hardy
plans
to
which
blake
listened
eagerly
capital
he
said
when
tom
had
finished
in
whose
rooms
did
you
say
they
are
in
hardy
and
he
works
at
them
every
night
with
grey
that
the
queer
big
servitor
his
particular
pal
put
in
drysdale
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
you
do
know
him
retorted
tom
and
the
less
you
say
about
him
the
better
i
know
he
wears
highlows
and
short
flannels
would
you
mind
asking
hardy
to
let
me
come
to
his
lectures
interrupted
blake
averting
the
strong
language
which
was
rising
to
tom
lips
i
think
they
seem
just
the
things
i
want
i
should
like
to
offer
to
pay
him
unless
you
i
quite
sure
interrupted
tom
that
he
wo
take
anything
i
will
ask
him
whether
he
will
let
you
come
and
he
is
such
a
kind
good
fellow
that
i
almost
sure
he
will
i
should
like
to
know
your
pal
too
brown
said
drysdale
you
must
introduce
me
with
blake
no
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
said
tom
then
i
shall
introduce
myself
said
drysdale
see
if
i
sit
next
him
now
at
your
wine
on
thursday
here
drysdale
scout
entered
with
two
notes
and
wished
to
know
if
drysdale
would
require
anything
more
nothing
but
hot
water
he
could
put
the
kettle
on
drysdale
said
and
go
and
while
the
scout
was
fulfilling
his
orders
he
got
up
carelessly
whistling
and
walking
to
the
fire
read
the
notes
by
the
light
of
one
of
the
candles
which
were
burning
on
the
blake
was
watching
him
eagerly
and
tom
saw
this
and
made
some
awkward
efforts
to
go
on
talking
about
the
advantages
of
plan
for
learning
history
but
he
was
talking
to
deaf
ears
and
soon
came
to
a
stand
still
he
saw
drysdale
crumple
up
the
notes
in
his
hand
and
shove
them
into
his
pocket
after
standing
for
a
few
seconds
in
the
same
position
with
his
back
to
them
he
turned
around
with
a
careless
air
and
sauntered
to
the
table
where
they
were
sitting
let
see
what
were
we
saying
he
began
oh
about
your
eccentric
pal
brown
you
answers
from
both
interrupted
blake
drysdale
nodded
and
was
beginning
to
speak
again
to
tom
when
blake
got
up
and
said
with
white
lips
i
see
them
no
never
mind
what
does
it
matter
matter
by
heaven
i
must
and
will
see
them
now
tom
saw
at
once
that
he
had
better
go
and
so
took
up
his
cap
wished
them
good
night
and
went
off
to
his
own
rooms
he
might
have
been
sitting
there
for
about
twenty
minutes
when
drysdale
entered
i
could
help
coming
over
brown
he
said
i
must
talk
to
some
one
and
blake
has
gone
off
raging
i
do
know
what
do
i
never
was
so
bothered
or
savage
in
my
life
i
am
very
sorry
said
tom
he
looked
very
bad
in
your
rooms
can
i
do
anything
no
but
i
must
talk
to
some
one
you
know
no
you
do
by
the
way
but
however
blake
got
me
out
of
a
tremendous
scrape
in
my
first
term
and
there
nothing
that
i
am
not
bound
to
do
for
him
and
would
do
if
i
could
yes
by
george
whatever
fellows
say
of
me
they
shall
never
say
i
did
stand
by
a
man
who
stood
by
me
well
he
owes
a
dirty
or
or
something
of
the
sort
nothing
worth
talking
of
i
know
to
people
in
oxford
and
they
have
been
leading
him
a
dog
life
this
year
and
more
now
he
just
going
up
for
his
degree
and
two
or
three
of
these
creditors
the
most
rascally
of
course
are
sueing
him
in
the
court
thinking
now
the
time
to
put
the
screw
on
he
will
be
ruined
if
they
are
not
stopped
somehow
just
after
i
saw
you
he
came
to
me
about
it
you
never
saw
a
fellow
in
such
a
state
i
could
see
it
was
tearing
him
to
pieces
telling
it
to
me
even
however
i
soon
set
him
at
ease
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
as
the
devil
will
have
it
i
ca
lend
him
the
money
though
would
get
him
over
the
examination
and
then
he
can
make
terms
my
guardian
advanced
me
beyond
my
allowance
just
before
easter
and
i
have
left
and
the
bank
here
has
given
me
notice
not
to
overdraw
any
more
however
i
thought
to
settle
it
easy
enough
so
i
told
him
to
meet
me
at
the
mitre
in
half
an
hour
for
dinner
and
when
he
was
gone
i
sat
down
and
wrote
two
notes
the
first
to
st
cloud
that
fellow
was
with
us
off
and
on
in
town
and
one
night
he
and
i
went
partners
at
i
finding
for
the
time
gains
and
losses
to
be
equally
shared
in
the
end
i
left
the
table
to
go
and
eat
some
supper
and
he
lost
and
paid
it
out
of
my
money
i
did
much
care
and
he
cursed
the
luck
and
acknowledged
that
he
owed
me
at
the
time
well
i
just
reminded
him
of
this
and
said
i
should
be
glad
of
it
i
know
he
has
plenty
of
money
just
now
but
added
that
it
might
stand
if
he
would
join
me
and
blake
in
borrowing
i
was
fool
enough
to
add
that
blake
was
in
difficulties
and
i
was
most
anxious
to
help
him
as
i
thought
that
st
cloud
would
probably
pay
the
but
do
no
more
i
wrote
also
to
chanter
heaven
knows
why
except
that
the
beast
rolls
in
money
and
has
fawned
on
me
till
i
been
nearly
sick
this
year
past
and
asked
him
to
lend
blake
on
our
joint
note
of
hand
poor
blake
when
i
told
him
what
i
had
done
at
the
mitre
i
think
i
might
as
well
have
stuck
the
carving
knife
into
him
we
had
a
wretched
two
hours
then
you
came
in
and
i
got
my
two
answers
here
they
are
tom
took
the
proffered
notes
and
read
dear
drysdale
please
explain
the
allusion
in
yours
to
some
mysterious
i
remember
perfectly
the
occurrence
to
which
you
refer
in
another
part
of
your
note
you
were
tired
of
sitting
at
the
table
and
went
off
to
supper
leaving
me
not
by
my
own
desire
to
play
for
you
with
your
money
i
did
so
and
had
abominable
luck
as
you
will
remember
for
i
handed
you
back
a
sadly
dwindled
heap
on
your
return
to
the
table
i
hope
you
are
in
no
row
about
that
night
i
shall
be
quite
ready
to
give
evidence
of
what
passed
if
it
will
help
you
in
any
way
i
am
always
yours
very
truly
st
cloud
i
must
decline
the
little
joint
operation
for
benefit
which
you
propose
the
second
answer
ran
dear
drysdale
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
accommodate
blake
as
a
friend
of
yours
but
you
see
his
acceptance
is
mere
waste
paper
and
you
can
not
give
security
until
you
are
of
age
so
if
you
were
to
die
the
money
would
be
lost
blake
has
always
carried
his
head
as
high
as
if
he
had
a
year
to
spend
perhaps
now
he
will
turn
less
haughty
to
men
who
could
buy
him
up
easy
enough
i
remain
yours
sincerely
jabez
chanter
tom
looked
up
and
met
drysdale
eyes
which
had
more
of
purpose
in
them
than
he
had
ever
seen
before
fancy
poor
blake
reading
those
two
notes
he
said
and
was
i
brought
them
on
him
however
he
shall
have
the
money
somehow
if
i
pawn
my
watch
i
be
even
with
those
two
some
day
the
two
remained
in
conference
for
some
time
longer
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
do
more
than
relate
the
result
at
three
the
next
day
blake
drysdale
and
tom
were
in
the
back
parlor
of
a
inn
in
the
on
the
table
were
pens
and
ink
some
cases
of
and
jewelry
and
behind
it
a
fat
man
of
forbidding
aspect
who
spent
a
day
or
two
in
each
term
at
oxford
he
held
in
his
thick
red
damp
hand
ornamented
as
to
the
with
a
huge
ring
a
piece
of
paper
then
i
shall
draw
for
a
if
you
do
we
wo
sign
said
drysdale
now
be
quick
ben
the
fat
man
name
was
benjamin
you
infernal
shark
been
wrangling
long
enough
over
it
draw
for
at
three
months
or
we
off
then
drysdale
you
gents
will
take
part
in
goods
i
wish
to
do
all
i
can
for
gents
as
comes
well
introduced
but
money
is
very
scarce
just
now
not
a
stuffed
bird
bottle
of
ring
or
cigar
will
we
have
so
now
no
more
nonsense
put
down
on
the
table
the
after
another
equally
useless
attempt
to
move
drysdale
who
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
spoke
produced
a
roll
of
bills
and
counted
out
thinking
to
himself
that
he
would
make
this
young
spark
sing
a
different
tune
before
very
long
he
then
filled
up
the
piece
of
paper
muttering
that
the
interest
was
nothing
considering
the
risk
and
he
hoped
they
would
help
him
to
some
thing
better
with
some
of
their
friends
drysdale
reminded
him
in
terms
not
too
carefully
chosen
that
he
was
getting
cent
per
cent
the
document
was
signed
drysdale
took
the
notes
and
they
went
out
well
that
well
over
said
drysdale
as
they
walked
towards
high
street
i
proud
of
my
tactics
i
must
say
one
never
does
so
well
for
oneself
as
for
anyone
else
if
i
had
been
on
my
own
hook
that
fellow
would
have
let
me
in
for
worth
of
stuffed
birds
and
bad
jewelry
let
see
what
do
you
want
blake
sixty
will
do
said
blake
you
had
better
take
there
be
some
law
costs
to
pay
and
drysdale
handed
him
the
notes
now
brown
shall
we
divide
the
balance
a
fiver
a
piece
no
thank
you
said
tom
i
do
want
it
as
you
two
are
to
hold
me
harmless
you
must
do
what
you
like
with
the
money
so
drysdale
pocketed
the
after
which
they
walked
in
silence
to
the
gate
of
ambrose
the
most
reckless
youngster
begin
this
sort
of
thing
without
reflections
which
are
apt
to
keep
him
silent
at
the
gates
blake
wrung
both
their
hands
i
do
say
much
but
i
forget
it
he
got
out
the
words
with
some
difficulty
and
went
off
to
his
rooms
chapter
xi
muscular
christianity
within
the
next
week
or
two
several
important
events
had
happened
to
one
and
another
of
our
ambrose
friends
tom
had
introduced
blake
to
hardy
after
some
demur
on
the
part
of
the
latter
blake
was
his
senior
by
a
term
might
have
called
on
him
any
time
these
three
years
why
should
he
want
to
make
his
acquaintance
now
but
when
tom
explained
to
him
that
it
would
be
a
kind
thing
to
let
blake
come
and
coach
up
his
history
with
him
for
that
unless
he
took
a
high
degree
in
the
coming
examination
he
would
have
to
leave
the
college
and
probably
be
ruined
for
life
hardy
at
once
consented
tom
did
not
venture
to
inquire
for
a
day
or
two
how
the
two
hit
it
off
together
when
he
began
cautiously
to
approach
the
subject
he
was
glad
to
find
that
hardy
liked
blake
he
is
a
gentleman
and
very
able
he
said
it
is
curious
to
see
how
quickly
he
is
overhauling
grey
and
yet
how
grey
takes
to
him
he
has
never
looked
scared
at
him
as
he
still
does
at
you
by
the
way
since
the
first
night
they
met
blake
has
the
talent
of
setting
people
at
their
ease
without
saying
anything
i
wonder
if
grey
thinks
he
has
sound
church
notions
it
a
dangerous
talent
and
may
make
a
man
very
false
if
he
take
care
tom
asked
if
blake
would
be
up
in
his
history
in
time
hardy
thought
he
might
perhaps
but
he
had
a
great
to
make
up
if
capacity
for
taking
in
cram
would
do
it
he
would
be
all
right
he
had
been
well
crammed
in
his
science
and
had
put
him
hardy
up
to
many
dodges
which
might
be
useful
in
the
schools
and
which
you
could
get
without
a
private
tutor
then
tom
first
wine
had
gone
off
most
successfully
jervis
and
miller
had
come
early
and
stayed
late
and
said
all
that
was
handsome
of
the
port
so
that
he
was
already
a
social
hero
with
the
boating
set
drysdale
of
course
had
been
there
rattling
away
to
everybody
in
his
reckless
fashion
and
setting
a
good
example
to
the
two
or
three
fast
men
whom
tom
knew
well
enough
to
ask
and
who
consequently
behaved
pretty
well
and
gave
themselves
no
airs
though
as
they
went
away
together
they
grumbled
slightly
that
brown
did
give
claret
the
rest
of
the
men
had
shaken
together
well
and
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
the
only
drawback
to
tom
had
been
that
neither
hardy
nor
grey
had
appeared
they
excused
themselves
afterwards
on
the
score
of
reading
but
tom
felt
aggrieved
in
hardy
case
he
knew
that
it
was
only
an
excuse
then
the
training
had
begun
seriously
miller
had
come
up
specially
for
the
first
fortnight
to
get
them
well
in
hand
as
he
said
after
they
were
once
fairly
started
he
would
have
to
go
down
till
just
before
the
races
but
he
thought
he
might
rely
on
the
captain
to
keep
them
up
to
their
work
in
the
interval
so
miller
the
coxswain
took
to
drawing
the
bow
up
to
the
ear
at
once
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
term
five
or
six
weeks
before
the
races
the
ambrose
boat
was
to
be
seen
every
other
day
at
abingdon
and
early
dinners
limitation
of
liquids
and
tobacco
and
abstinence
from
late
supper
parties
pastry
ice
and
all
manner
of
trash
likely
in
miller
opinion
to
injure
nerve
or
wind
were
hanging
over
the
crew
and
already
in
fact
to
some
extent
enforced
the
captain
shrugged
his
shoulders
submitted
to
it
all
himself
and
worked
away
with
all
imperturbable
temper
merely
hinting
to
miller
in
private
that
he
was
going
too
fast
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
keep
it
up
diogenes
highly
approved
he
would
have
become
the
willing
slave
of
any
tyranny
which
should
insist
that
every
adult
male
subject
should
pull
twenty
miles
and
never
imbibe
more
than
a
quart
of
liquid
in
the
hours
tom
was
inclined
to
like
it
as
it
helped
him
to
realize
the
proud
fact
that
he
was
actually
in
the
boat
the
rest
of
the
crew
were
in
all
stages
of
mutiny
and
were
only
kept
from
breaking
out
by
their
fondness
for
the
captain
and
the
knowledge
that
miller
was
going
in
a
few
days
as
it
was
blake
was
the
only
one
who
openly
rebelled
once
or
twice
he
stayed
away
miller
swore
and
grumbled
the
captain
shook
his
head
and
the
crew
in
general
rejoiced
it
is
to
one
of
these
occasions
to
which
we
must
now
turn
if
the
usual
casual
voyager
of
novels
had
been
standing
on
sandford
lock
at
about
four
on
the
afternoon
of
april
he
might
have
beheld
the
ambrose
coming
with
a
steady
swing
up
the
last
reach
if
such
voyager
were
in
the
least
conversant
with
the
glorious
mystery
of
rowing
he
would
have
felt
his
heart
warm
at
the
magnificent
sweep
and
life
of
the
stroke
and
would
on
the
whole
have
been
pleased
with
the
performance
of
the
crew
generally
considered
as
a
college
crew
in
the
early
stages
of
training
they
came
hard
all
up
to
the
pool
below
the
lock
the
coxswain
standing
in
the
stern
with
a
in
each
hand
and
then
shipped
oars
the
opened
and
the
boat
entered
and
in
another
minute
or
two
was
moored
to
the
bank
above
the
lock
and
the
crew
strolled
into
the
little
inn
which
stands
by
the
lock
and
after
stopping
in
the
bar
to
lay
hands
on
several
pewters
full
of
porter
passed
through
the
house
into
the
quoit
and
behind
these
were
already
well
filled
with
men
of
other
crews
playing
in
groups
or
looking
on
at
the
players
one
of
these
groups
as
they
passed
seized
on
the
captain
and
miller
stopped
with
him
the
rest
of
the
ambrose
men
in
no
humor
for
skittles
quoits
or
any
relaxation
except
rest
and
grumbling
took
possession
of
the
first
table
and
seats
offered
and
came
to
anchor
then
followed
a
moment
of
intense
enjoyment
of
a
sort
only
appreciable
by
those
who
have
had
a
twelve
miles
training
pull
with
a
coxswain
as
sharp
as
a
needle
and
in
an
awful
temper
ah
said
drysdale
taking
the
pewter
down
from
his
lips
with
a
sigh
and
handing
it
to
tom
who
sat
next
him
by
jove
i
feel
better
it
almost
worth
while
pulling
all
from
abingdon
to
get
such
a
thirst
said
another
of
the
crew
i
tell
you
what
though
said
drysdale
the
last
day
you
catch
me
in
this
blessed
boat
tom
had
just
finished
his
draught
but
did
not
reply
it
was
by
no
means
the
first
time
that
drysdale
had
announced
this
resolve
the
rest
were
silent
also
it
bad
enough
to
have
to
pull
your
heart
out
without
getting
abused
all
the
way
into
the
bargain
there
miller
stands
in
the
stern
and
a
devilish
easy
thing
it
is
to
stand
there
and
walk
into
us
i
can
see
him
chuckle
as
he
comes
to
you
and
me
brown
well
forward
do
jerk
throw
your
weight
on
the
oar
come
now
you
can
get
another
pound
on
i
hang
on
like
grim
death
then
its
now
well
it
a
great
compliment
broke
in
tom
with
a
laugh
he
thinks
he
can
make
something
of
us
he
make
nothing
of
us
first
i
think
said
drysdale
lost
eight
pounds
in
a
fortnight
the
captain
ought
to
put
me
in
every
place
in
the
boat
in
turn
to
make
it
larded
the
bottom
boards
under
my
seat
so
that
not
a
drop
of
water
will
ever
come
through
again
a
very
good
thing
for
you
old
fellow
said
diogenes
you
look
ten
times
better
than
you
did
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
i
do
know
what
you
call
a
good
thing
you
old
fluter
obliged
to
sit
on
my
hip
bones
i
ca
go
to
a
lecture
all
the
tutors
think
i
am
poking
fun
at
them
and
put
me
on
directly
i
have
been
able
to
go
to
lecture
these
ten
days
so
fond
of
lecture
as
he
is
too
poor
fellow
put
in
tom
but
they
discommonsed
me
for
staying
away
said
drysdale
not
that
i
care
much
for
that
though
well
miller
goes
down
morning
i
heard
him
say
so
said
another
then
we
memorialize
the
captain
and
get
out
of
these
abingdon
pulls
life
is
worth
having
at
this
rate
no
other
boat
has
been
below
sandford
yet
and
so
they
sat
on
and
plotted
and
soon
most
of
the
other
crews
started
and
then
they
took
their
turn
at
skittles
and
almost
forgot
their
grievances
which
must
be
explained
to
those
who
do
know
the
river
at
oxford
the
river
runs
along
the
south
of
the
city
getting
into
the
university
quarter
after
it
passes
under
the
bridge
connecting
berks
and
oxfordshire
over
which
is
the
road
to
abingdon
just
below
this
bridge
are
the
boat
builders
establishments
on
both
sides
of
the
river
and
then
on
the
oxfordshire
side
is
christchurch
meadow
opposite
which
is
moored
the
university
barge
here
is
the
goal
of
all
university
races
and
the
racecourse
stretches
away
down
the
river
for
a
mile
and
a
half
and
a
little
below
the
starting
place
of
the
races
is
iffley
lock
the
next
lock
below
iffley
is
the
sandford
lock
where
we
left
our
boat
crew
playing
at
skittles
which
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half
below
iffley
below
sandford
there
is
no
lock
till
you
get
to
abingdon
a
distance
of
six
miles
and
more
by
the
river
now
inasmuch
as
the
longest
distance
to
be
rowed
in
the
races
is
only
the
upper
mile
and
a
half
from
iffley
to
the
university
barge
of
course
all
crews
think
themselves
very
hardly
treated
if
they
are
taken
further
than
to
sandford
pulling
hard
all
from
sandford
to
iffley
and
then
again
from
iffley
over
the
regular
course
ought
to
be
enough
in
all
conscience
so
chorus
the
crews
and
most
captains
and
coxswains
give
in
but
here
and
there
some
enemy
of
his
kind
some
uncomfortable
worriting
energizing
mortal
like
miller
gets
command
of
a
boat
and
then
the
unfortunate
crew
are
dragged
bemoaning
their
fate
down
below
sandford
where
no
friendly
lock
intervenes
to
break
the
long
steady
swing
of
the
training
pull
every
two
miles
and
the
result
for
the
time
is
blisters
and
mutiny
i
am
bound
to
add
that
it
generally
tells
and
that
the
crew
which
has
been
undergoing
that
forte
et
is
very
apt
to
get
the
change
out
of
it
on
the
nights
of
hard
races
so
the
ambrose
crew
played
out
their
skittles
and
settled
to
appeal
the
captain
in
a
body
the
next
day
after
departure
and
then
being
summoned
to
the
boat
they
took
to
the
water
again
and
paddled
steadily
up
home
arriving
just
in
time
for
hall
for
those
who
liked
to
hurry
drysdale
never
liked
hurrying
himself
besides
he
could
not
dine
in
hall
as
he
was
discommonsed
for
persistent
absence
from
lecture
and
neglect
to
go
to
the
dean
when
sent
for
to
explain
his
absence
i
say
brown
hang
hall
he
said
to
tom
who
was
throwing
on
his
things
come
and
dine
with
me
at
the
mitre
i
give
you
a
bottle
of
hock
it
very
good
there
hock
about
the
worst
thing
you
drink
in
training
said
miller
is
it
jervis
it
no
good
certainly
said
the
captain
as
he
put
on
his
cap
and
gown
come
along
miller
there
you
hear
said
miller
you
can
drink
a
glass
of
sound
sherry
if
you
want
wine
and
he
followed
the
captain
drysdale
performed
a
defiant
pantomime
after
the
retiring
coxswain
and
then
easily
carried
his
point
with
tom
except
as
to
the
hock
so
they
walked
up
to
the
mitre
together
where
drysdale
ordered
dinner
and
a
bottle
of
hock
in
the
do
order
hock
drysdale
i
sha
drink
any
then
i
shall
have
it
all
to
my
own
cheek
if
you
begin
making
a
slave
of
yourself
to
that
miller
he
very
soon
cut
you
down
to
a
glass
of
water
a
day
with
a
pinch
of
rhubarb
in
it
and
make
you
drink
that
standing
on
your
head
gammon
but
i
do
think
it
fair
on
the
rest
of
the
crew
not
to
train
as
well
as
one
can
you
do
suppose
drinking
a
pint
of
hock
will
make
you
pull
any
the
worse
this
day
six
weeks
when
the
races
begin
do
you
no
but
hullo
look
here
said
drysdale
who
was
inspecting
a
printed
bill
pinned
up
on
the
wall
of
the
coffee
hall
menagerie
is
in
the
town
somewhere
down
by
worcester
what
fun
we
go
there
after
dinner
the
food
arrived
with
drysdale
hock
which
he
seemed
to
enjoy
all
the
more
from
the
assurance
which
every
glass
gave
him
that
he
was
defying
the
coxswain
and
doing
just
the
thing
he
would
most
dislike
so
he
drank
away
and
facetiously
speculated
how
he
could
be
such
an
idiot
as
to
go
on
pulling
every
day
of
his
life
he
made
good
resolutions
in
the
reach
above
the
gut
that
it
should
be
his
last
performance
and
always
broke
them
next
day
he
supposed
the
habit
he
had
of
breaking
all
good
resolutions
was
the
way
to
account
for
it
after
dinner
they
set
off
to
find
the
show
and
as
they
will
be
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
reaching
it
for
the
pitch
is
in
a
part
of
the
suburbs
little
known
to
gownsmen
the
opportunity
may
be
seized
of
making
a
few
remarks
to
the
patient
reader
which
impatient
readers
are
begged
to
skip
our
hero
on
his
first
appearance
in
public
some
years
since
was
without
his
own
consent
at
once
patted
on
the
back
by
the
critics
and
enrolled
for
better
or
worse
in
the
brotherhood
of
muscular
christians
who
at
that
time
were
beginning
to
be
recognised
as
an
actual
and
lusty
portion
of
general
british
life
as
his
biographer
i
am
not
about
to
take
exception
to
his
enrolment
for
after
considering
the
persons
up
and
down
her
majesty
dominions
to
whom
the
new
has
been
applied
the
principles
which
they
are
supposed
to
hold
and
the
sort
of
lives
they
are
supposed
to
lead
i
can
not
see
where
he
could
in
these
times
have
fallen
upon
a
nobler
brotherhood
i
am
speaking
of
course
under
correction
and
with
only
a
slight
acquaintance
with
the
faith
of
muscular
christianity
gathered
almost
entirely
from
the
witty
expositions
and
comments
of
persons
of
a
somewhat
dyspeptic
habit
who
are
not
amongst
the
faithful
themselves
indeed
i
am
not
aware
that
any
authorized
articles
of
belief
have
been
sanctioned
or
published
by
the
sect
church
or
whatever
they
may
be
moreover
at
the
age
at
which
our
hero
has
arrived
and
having
regard
to
his
character
i
should
say
that
he
has
in
all
likelihood
thought
very
little
on
the
subject
of
belief
and
would
scarcely
be
able
to
give
any
formal
account
of
his
own
beyond
that
contained
in
the
church
catechism
which
i
for
one
think
may
very
well
satisfy
him
for
the
present
nevertheless
he
had
suddenly
been
caught
at
the
gate
of
ambrose
college
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
do
the
classifying
for
the
british
public
and
accosted
with
sir
you
belong
to
a
body
whose
creed
it
is
to
fear
god
and
walk
miles
in
hours
i
believe
he
would
have
replied
do
i
sir
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
they
must
be
a
very
good
set
of
fellows
how
many
weeks
training
do
they
allow
but
in
the
course
of
my
inquiries
on
the
subject
of
muscular
christians
their
works
and
ways
a
fact
has
forced
itself
on
my
attention
which
for
the
sake
of
ingenious
youth
ought
not
to
be
passed
over
i
find
then
that
side
by
side
with
these
muscular
christians
and
apparently
claiming
some
sort
of
connection
with
them
the
same
concern
as
the
pirates
of
say
have
risen
up
another
set
of
persons
against
whom
i
desire
to
caution
my
readers
and
my
hero
and
to
warn
the
latter
that
i
do
not
mean
on
any
pretense
whatever
to
allow
him
to
connect
himself
with
them
however
much
he
may
be
taken
with
their
hail
brother
manner
and
dress
which
may
easily
lead
careless
observers
to
take
the
counterfeit
for
the
true
article
i
must
call
the
persons
in
question
musclemen
as
distinguished
from
muscular
christians
the
only
point
in
common
between
the
two
being
that
both
hold
it
to
be
a
good
thing
to
have
strong
and
bodies
ready
to
be
put
at
the
shortest
notice
to
any
work
of
which
bodies
are
capable
and
to
do
it
well
here
all
likeness
ends
for
the
muscle
man
seems
to
have
no
belief
whatever
as
to
the
purposes
for
which
his
body
has
been
given
him
except
some
hazy
idea
that
it
is
to
go
up
and
down
the
world
with
him
belaboring
men
or
captivating
women
for
his
benefit
or
pleasure
at
once
the
servant
and
fomentor
of
those
fierce
and
brutal
passions
which
he
seems
to
think
it
a
necessity
and
rather
a
fine
thing
than
otherwise
to
indulge
and
obey
whereas
so
far
as
i
know
the
least
of
the
muscular
christians
has
hold
of
the
old
chivalrous
and
christian
belief
that
a
man
body
is
given
him
to
be
trained
and
brought
into
subjection
and
then
used
for
the
protection
of
the
weak
the
advancement
of
all
righteous
causes
and
the
subduing
of
the
earth
which
god
has
given
to
the
children
of
men
he
does
not
hold
that
mere
strength
or
activity
are
in
themselves
worthy
of
any
respect
or
worship
or
that
one
man
is
a
bit
better
than
another
because
he
can
knock
him
down
or
carry
a
bigger
sack
of
potatoes
than
he
for
mere
power
whether
of
body
or
intellect
he
has
i
hope
and
believe
no
reverence
whatever
though
he
would
probably
himself
as
a
matter
of
taste
prefer
the
man
who
can
lift
a
round
his
head
with
his
little
finger
to
the
man
who
can
construct
a
string
of
perfect
sorites
or
expound
the
doctrine
of
contradictory
inconceivables
the
above
remarks
occur
as
our
hero
is
marching
innocently
down
towards
his
first
town
and
gown
row
and
i
should
scarcely
like
to
see
him
in
the
middle
of
it
without
protesting
that
it
is
a
mistake
i
know
that
he
and
other
youngsters
of
his
kidney
will
have
fits
of
fighting
or
desiring
to
fight
with
their
poorer
brethren
just
as
children
have
the
measles
but
the
shorter
the
fit
the
better
for
the
patient
for
like
the
measles
it
is
a
great
mistake
and
a
most
unsatisfactory
complaint
if
they
can
escape
it
altogether
so
much
the
better
but
instead
of
treating
the
fit
as
a
disease
musclemen
professors
are
wont
to
represent
it
as
a
state
of
health
and
to
let
their
disciples
run
about
in
middle
age
with
the
measles
on
them
as
strong
as
ever
now
although
our
hero
had
the
measles
on
him
at
this
particular
time
and
the
passage
of
arms
which
i
am
about
shortly
to
describe
led
to
results
of
some
importance
in
his
history
and
can
not
therefore
be
passed
over
yet
i
wish
at
the
same
time
to
disclaim
both
in
my
sponsorial
and
individual
character
all
sympathy
with
town
and
gown
rows
and
with
all
other
class
rows
and
quarrels
of
every
sort
and
kind
whether
waged
with
sword
pen
tongue
fist
or
otherwise
also
to
say
that
in
all
such
rows
so
far
as
i
have
seen
or
read
from
the
time
when
the
roman
plebs
marched
out
to
mons
sacer
down
to
when
the
english
chartists
met
on
kennington
common
the
upper
classes
are
most
to
blame
it
may
be
that
they
are
not
the
aggressors
on
any
given
occasion
very
possibly
they
may
carry
on
the
actual
fighting
with
more
fairness
though
this
is
by
no
means
true
as
a
rule
nevertheless
the
state
of
feeling
which
makes
such
things
possible
especially
in
england
where
men
in
general
are
only
too
ready
to
be
led
and
taught
by
their
superiors
in
rank
may
be
fairly
laid
at
their
door
ever
in
the
case
of
strikes
which
just
now
will
of
course
be
at
once
thrown
in
my
teeth
i
say
fearlessly
let
any
man
take
the
trouble
to
study
the
question
honestly
and
he
will
come
to
the
conviction
that
all
combinations
of
the
men
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
labor
market
whether
in
the
much
and
unjustly
abused
societies
or
in
other
forms
have
been
defensive
organizations
and
that
the
masters
might
as
a
body
over
and
over
again
have
taken
the
sting
out
of
them
if
they
had
acted
fairly
as
many
individuals
amongst
them
have
done
whether
it
may
not
be
too
late
now
is
a
tremendous
question
for
england
but
one
which
time
only
can
decide
when
drysdale
and
tom
at
last
found
the
caravans
it
was
just
getting
dark
something
of
a
crowd
had
collected
outside
and
there
was
some
hissing
as
they
ascended
the
short
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
platform
in
front
of
the
show
but
they
took
no
notice
of
it
paid
their
money
and
entered
inside
they
found
an
exciting
scene
the
place
was
pretty
well
lighted
and
the
birds
and
beasts
were
all
alive
in
their
several
dens
and
cages
walking
up
and
down
and
each
uttering
remonstrances
after
its
own
manner
the
shrill
notes
of
birds
mingling
with
the
moan
of
the
beasts
of
prey
and
chattering
of
the
monkeys
feeding
time
had
been
put
off
till
night
to
suit
the
undergraduates
and
the
undergraduates
were
proving
their
appreciation
of
the
attention
by
playing
off
all
manner
of
practical
jokes
on
birds
and
beasts
their
keepers
and
such
of
the
public
as
had
been
rash
enough
to
venture
in
at
the
farther
end
was
the
keeper
who
did
the
showman
vainly
endeavouring
to
go
through
his
usual
jogtrot
description
his
monotone
was
drowned
every
minute
by
the
chorus
of
voices
each
shouting
out
some
new
fact
in
natural
history
touching
the
biped
or
quadruped
whom
the
keeper
was
attempting
to
describe
at
that
day
a
great
deal
of
this
sort
of
chaff
was
current
so
that
the
most
boy
had
plenty
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
a
small
and
indignant
knot
of
townspeople
headed
by
a
stout
and
severe
woman
with
two
big
boys
her
sons
followed
the
keeper
endeavouring
by
caustic
remarks
and
withering
glances
to
stop
the
flood
of
chaff
and
restore
the
legitimate
authority
and
the
reign
of
keeper
and
natural
history
at
another
point
was
a
long
irishman
in
cap
and
gown
who
had
clearly
had
as
much
wine
as
he
could
carry
close
to
the
bars
of
the
panther
den
through
which
he
was
earnestly
endeavouring
with
the
help
of
a
crooked
stick
to
draw
the
tail
of
whichever
of
the
beasts
stopped
for
a
moment
in
its
uneasy
walk
on
the
other
side
were
a
set
of
men
bent
on
burning
the
wretched
monkeys
fingers
with
the
lighted
ends
of
their
cigars
in
which
they
seemed
successful
enough
to
judge
by
the
angry
chatterings
and
shriekings
of
their
victims
the
two
new
comers
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
platform
inside
the
curtain
and
then
drysdale
rubbing
his
hands
and
in
high
glee
at
the
sight
of
so
much
misrule
in
so
small
a
place
led
the
way
down
on
to
the
floor
deep
in
sawdust
exclaiming
well
this
a
lark
we
just
in
for
all
the
fun
of
the
fair
tom
followed
his
friend
who
made
straight
for
the
show
man
and
planted
himself
at
his
side
just
as
that
worthy
pointing
with
his
pole
was
proceeding
this
is
the
jackal
from
the
caribee
hielands
of
which
i
a
native
mysel
shouted
a
gownsman
this
is
the
jackal
or
lion
provider
began
again
the
much
enduring
keeper
who
always
goes
before
the
lion
to
purwide
his
purwisions
purwiding
there
anything
to
purwide
put
in
drysdale
hem
really
i
do
think
it
scandalous
not
to
let
the
keeper
tell
about
the
beasteses
said
the
unfortunate
matron
with
a
half
turn
towards
the
persecutors
and
grasping
her
bag
my
dear
madam
said
drysdale
in
his
softest
voice
i
assure
you
he
knows
nothing
about
the
beasteses
we
are
doctor
buckland
favourite
pupils
are
also
well
known
to
the
great
panjandrum
and
have
eaten
more
beasteses
than
the
keeper
has
ever
seen
i
do
know
who
you
are
young
man
but
you
do
know
how
to
behave
yourselves
rejoined
the
outraged
female
and
the
keeper
giving
up
the
jackal
as
a
bad
job
pointing
with
his
pole
proceeded
the
little
hanimal
in
the
upper
cage
is
the
hopossom
of
north
america
the
misguided
offspring
of
the
raccoon
and
the
gumtree
put
in
one
of
his
tormentors
here
a
frightful
roaring
and
struggling
at
a
little
distance
mingled
with
shouts
of
laughter
and
hold
on
pat
go
it
panther
interrupted
the
lecture
and
caused
a
rush
to
the
other
side
where
the
long
irishman
donovan
by
name
with
one
foot
against
the
bars
was
holding
on
to
the
tail
of
one
of
the
panthers
which
he
had
at
length
managed
to
catch
hold
of
the
next
moment
he
was
flat
on
his
back
in
the
sawdust
and
his
victim
was
bounding
wildly
about
the
cage
the
keeper
hurried
away
to
look
after
the
outraged
panther
and
drysdale
at
once
installing
himself
as
showman
began
at
the
next
cage
this
is
the
wild
man
of
the
woods
or
the
most
untameable
good
heavens
take
care
and
he
seized
hold
on
the
unfortunate
woman
and
pulled
her
away
from
the
bars
oh
goodness
she
screamed
it
got
my
tippet
oh
bill
peter
catch
hold
bill
and
peter
proved
unequal
to
the
occasion
but
a
gownsman
seized
the
vanishing
tippet
and
after
a
moment
struggle
with
the
great
ape
restored
a
meagre
half
to
the
proper
owner
while
jacko
sat
grinning
over
the
other
half
picking
it
to
pieces
the
poor
woman
had
now
had
enough
of
it
and
she
hurried
off
with
her
two
boys
followed
by
the
few
townspeople
who
were
still
in
the
show
to
lay
her
case
directly
before
the
mayor
as
she
informed
the
delinquents
from
the
platform
before
disappearing
her
wrongs
were
likely
to
be
more
speedily
avenged
to
judge
by
the
angry
murmurs
which
arose
outside
immediately
after
her
exit
but
still
the
high
jinks
went
on
donovan
leading
all
mischief
until
the
master
of
the
menagerie
appeared
inside
and
remonstrated
with
the
men
he
must
send
for
the
police
he
said
if
they
would
not
leave
the
beasts
alone
he
had
put
off
the
feeding
in
order
to
suit
them
would
they
let
his
keepers
feed
the
beasts
quietly
the
threat
of
the
police
was
received
with
shouts
of
defiance
by
some
of
the
men
though
the
greater
part
seemed
of
the
opinion
that
matters
were
getting
serious
the
proposal
of
feeding
was
however
welcomed
by
all
and
comparative
quiet
ensued
for
some
ten
minutes
while
the
baskets
of
joints
bread
stale
fish
and
potatoes
were
brought
in
and
the
contents
distributed
to
the
famished
occupants
of
the
cages
in
the
interval
of
peace
the
on
a
hint
from
his
master
again
began
his
round
but
the
spirit
of
mischief
was
abroad
and
it
only
needed
this
to
make
it
break
out
again
in
another
two
minutes
the
beasts
from
the
lion
to
the
smallest
monkey
were
struggling
for
their
suppers
with
one
or
more
undergraduates
the
elephant
had
torn
the
gown
off
back
having
only
just
missed
his
arm
the
manager
in
a
confusion
worthy
of
the
tower
of
babel
sent
off
a
keeper
for
the
city
police
and
turned
the
gas
out
the
audience
after
the
first
moment
of
surprise
and
indignation
groped
their
way
towards
the
steps
and
mounted
the
platform
where
they
held
a
council
of
war
should
they
stay
where
they
were
or
make
a
sally
at
once
break
through
the
crowd
and
get
back
to
their
colleges
it
was
curious
to
see
how
in
that
short
minute
individual
character
came
out
and
the
coward
the
cautious
man
the
resolute
prompt
englishman
each
was
there
and
more
than
one
species
of
each
donovan
was
one
of
the
last
up
the
steps
and
as
he
stumbled
up
caught
something
of
the
question
before
the
house
he
shouted
loudly
at
once
for
descending
and
offering
battle
but
boys
he
added
first
wait
till
i
adthress
the
meeting
and
he
made
for
the
opening
in
the
canvas
through
which
the
outside
platform
was
reached
stump
oratory
and
a
free
fight
were
just
the
two
temptations
which
donovan
was
wholly
unable
to
resist
it
was
with
a
face
radiant
with
delight
that
he
burst
through
the
opening
followed
by
all
the
rest
who
felt
that
the
matter
was
out
of
their
hands
and
must
go
its
own
way
after
the
irishman
and
rolling
to
the
front
of
the
outside
platform
rested
one
hand
on
the
rail
and
waved
the
other
gracefully
towards
the
crowd
this
was
the
signal
for
a
burst
of
defiant
shouts
and
hissing
donovan
stood
blandly
waving
his
hand
for
silence
drysdale
running
his
eye
over
the
mob
turned
to
the
rest
and
said
there
nothing
to
stop
us
not
twenty
grown
men
in
the
whole
lot
then
one
of
the
men
lighting
upon
the
drumsticks
which
the
usual
man
in
corduroys
had
hidden
away
began
beating
the
big
drum
furiously
one
of
the
unaccountable
whims
which
influence
crowds
seized
on
the
mob
and
there
was
almost
perfect
silence
this
seemed
to
take
donovan
by
surprise
the
open
air
was
having
the
common
effect
on
him
he
was
getting
unsteady
on
his
legs
and
his
brains
were
wondering
now
your
time
donovan
my
boy
begin
ah
yes
to
be
sure
what
i
say
let
see
said
donovan
putting
his
head
on
one
side
friends
romans
countrymen
suggested
some
wag
to
be
sure
cried
donovan
friends
romans
countrymen
lend
me
your
ears
bravo
pat
well
begun
pull
their
ears
well
when
you
got
bad
luck
to
it
where
was
i
you
divels
i
mean
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
oxford
city
as
i
was
saying
the
then
the
storm
of
shouting
and
hissing
arose
again
and
donovan
after
an
ineffectual
attempt
or
two
to
go
on
leaned
forward
and
shook
his
fist
generally
at
the
mob
luckily
for
him
there
were
no
stones
about
but
one
of
the
crowd
catching
the
first
missel
at
hand
which
happened
to
be
a
cabbage
stalk
sent
it
with
true
aim
at
the
enraged
orator
he
jerked
his
head
on
one
side
to
avoid
it
the
motion
unsteadied
his
cap
he
threw
up
his
hand
which
instead
of
catching
the
falling
cap
as
it
was
meant
to
do
sent
it
spinning
among
the
crowd
below
the
owner
without
a
moment
hesitation
clapped
both
hands
on
the
bar
before
him
and
followed
his
property
vaulting
over
on
the
heads
of
those
nearest
the
platform
amongst
whom
he
fell
scattering
them
right
and
left
come
on
gown
or
he
be
murdered
sang
out
one
of
friends
tom
was
one
of
the
first
down
the
steps
they
rushed
to
the
spot
in
another
moment
and
the
irishman
rose
plastered
with
dirt
but
otherwise
none
the
worse
for
his
feat
his
cap
covered
with
mud
was
proudly
stuck
on
hind
part
before
he
was
of
course
thirsting
for
battle
but
not
quite
so
much
master
of
his
strength
as
usual
so
his
two
friends
who
were
luckily
strong
and
big
men
seized
him
one
to
each
arm
come
along
keep
together
was
the
word
there
no
time
to
lose
push
for
the
the
cry
of
town
town
now
rose
on
all
sides
the
gownsmen
in
a
compact
body
with
donovan
in
the
middle
pushed
rapidly
across
the
open
space
in
which
the
caravans
were
set
up
and
gained
the
street
here
they
were
comparatively
safe
they
were
followed
close
but
could
not
be
surrounded
by
the
mob
and
now
again
a
bystander
might
have
amused
himself
by
noting
the
characters
three
or
four
pushed
rapidly
on
and
were
out
of
sight
ahead
in
no
time
the
greater
part
without
showing
any
actual
signs
off
fear
kept
steadily
on
at
a
good
pace
close
behind
these
donovan
struggled
violently
with
his
two
conductors
and
shouted
defiance
to
the
town
while
a
small
and
silent
rear
guard
amongst
whom
were
tom
and
drysdale
walked
slowly
and
to
all
appearance
carelessly
behind
within
a
few
yards
of
the
crowd
of
shouting
boys
who
headed
the
advancing
town
tom
himself
felt
his
heart
beating
quick
and
i
do
think
had
any
particular
desire
for
the
fighting
to
begin
with
such
long
odds
on
the
town
side
but
he
was
resolved
to
be
in
it
as
soon
as
any
one
if
there
was
to
be
any
thus
they
marched
through
one
or
two
streets
without
anything
more
serious
than
an
occasional
stone
passing
their
ears
another
turn
would
have
brought
them
into
the
open
parts
of
the
town
within
hearing
of
the
colleges
when
suddenly
donovan
broke
loose
from
his
supporters
and
rushing
with
a
shout
on
the
advanced
guard
of
the
town
drove
them
back
in
confusion
for
some
yards
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
back
him
up
so
the
shouting
gown
gown
charged
after
him
the
effect
of
the
onset
was
like
that
of
blount
at
flodden
when
he
saw
marmion
banner
go
down
a
wide
space
was
cleared
for
a
moment
the
town
driven
back
on
the
pavements
and
up
the
middle
of
the
street
and
the
rescued
donovan
caught
set
on
his
legs
and
dragged
away
again
some
paces
towards
college
but
the
charging
body
was
too
few
in
number
to
improve
the
first
success
or
even
to
insure
its
own
retreat
darkly
closed
the
war
around
the
town
lapped
on
them
from
the
pavements
and
poured
on
them
down
the
middle
of
the
street
before
they
had
time
to
rally
and
stand
together
again
what
happened
to
the
rest
who
was
down
who
fought
who
fled
tom
had
no
time
to
inquire
for
he
found
himself
suddenly
the
centre
of
a
yelling
circle
of
enemies
so
he
set
his
teeth
and
buckled
to
his
work
and
the
thought
of
splendid
single
combat
and
glory
such
as
he
had
read
of
in
college
stories
and
tradition
handing
him
down
as
the
hero
of
that
great
night
flashed
into
his
head
as
he
cast
his
eye
round
for
foemen
worthy
of
his
steel
none
such
appeared
so
selecting
the
one
most
of
his
own
size
he
squared
and
advanced
on
him
but
the
challenged
one
declined
the
combat
and
kept
retreating
while
from
behind
and
at
the
sides
one
after
another
of
the
town
rushing
out
dealt
tom
a
blow
and
vanished
again
into
the
crowd
for
a
moment
or
two
he
kept
his
head
and
temper
the
assailants
individually
were
too
insignificant
to
put
out
his
strength
upon
but
head
and
temper
were
rapidly
going
he
was
like
a
bull
in
the
arena
with
the
picadores
sticking
their
little
javelins
in
him
a
smart
blow
on
the
nose
which
set
a
myriad
of
stars
dancing
before
his
eyes
finished
the
business
and
he
rushed
after
the
last
assailant
dealing
blows
to
right
and
left
on
small
and
great
the
mob
closed
in
on
him
still
avoiding
attacks
in
front
but
on
the
flank
and
rear
they
hung
on
him
and
battered
at
him
he
had
to
turn
sharply
round
after
every
step
to
shake
himself
clear
and
at
each
turn
the
press
thickened
the
shouts
waxed
louder
and
fiercer
he
began
to
get
unsteady
tottered
swayed
and
stumbling
over
a
prostrate
youth
at
last
went
down
full
length
on
to
the
pavement
carrying
a
couple
of
his
assailants
with
him
and
now
it
would
have
fared
hardly
with
him
and
he
would
scarcely
have
reached
college
with
sound
bones
for
i
am
sorry
to
say
an
oxford
town
mob
is
a
cruel
and
brutal
one
and
a
man
who
is
down
has
no
chance
with
it
but
that
for
one
moment
he
and
his
prostrate
foes
were
so
jumbled
together
that
the
town
could
not
get
at
him
and
the
next
cry
of
gown
gown
rose
high
above
the
din
the
town
were
swept
back
again
by
the
rush
of
a
reinforcement
of
gownsmen
the
leader
of
whom
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
and
put
him
on
his
legs
again
while
his
late
antagonists
crawled
away
to
the
side
of
the
road
why
brown
said
his
rescuer
jervis
the
captain
this
you
not
hurt
eh
not
a
bit
said
tom
good
come
on
then
stick
to
me
in
three
steps
they
joined
the
rest
of
the
gown
now
numbering
some
twenty
men
the
mob
was
close
before
them
gathering
for
another
rush
tom
felt
a
cruel
wild
devil
beginning
to
rise
in
him
he
had
never
felt
the
like
before
this
time
he
longed
for
the
next
crash
which
happily
for
him
was
fated
never
to
come
off
your
names
and
colleges
gentlemen
said
a
voice
close
behind
them
at
this
critical
moment
the
town
set
up
a
derisive
shout
and
turning
round
the
gownsmen
found
the
velvet
sleeves
of
one
of
the
proctors
at
their
elbow
and
his
satellites
vulgarly
called
taking
notes
of
them
they
were
completely
caught
and
so
quietly
gave
the
required
information
you
will
go
to
your
colleges
at
once
said
the
proctor
and
remain
within
gates
you
will
see
these
gentlemen
to
the
he
added
to
his
marshal
and
then
strode
on
after
the
crowd
which
was
vanishing
down
the
street
the
men
turned
and
strolled
towards
the
the
marshall
keeping
in
a
deferential
but
manner
pretty
close
to
them
but
without
making
any
show
of
watching
them
when
they
reached
the
he
touched
his
hat
and
said
civilly
i
hope
you
will
go
home
now
gentlemen
the
senior
proctor
is
very
strict
all
right
marshall
good
night
said
the
good
natured
ones
d
his
impudence
growled
one
or
two
of
the
rest
and
the
marshal
bustled
away
after
his
master
the
men
looked
at
one
another
for
a
moment
or
two
they
were
of
different
colleges
and
strangers
the
was
quiet
so
without
the
exchange
of
a
word
after
the
manner
of
british
youth
they
broke
up
into
twos
and
threes
and
parted
jervis
tom
and
drysdale
who
turned
up
quite
undamaged
sauntered
together
towards
ambrose
i
say
where
are
you
going
said
drysdale
not
to
college
i
vote
said
tom
no
there
may
be
some
more
fun
mighty
poor
fun
i
should
say
you
find
it
said
jervis
however
if
you
will
stay
i
suppose
i
must
i
ca
leave
you
two
boys
by
yourselves
come
along
then
down
here
so
they
turned
down
one
of
the
courts
leading
out
of
the
and
so
by
back
streets
bore
up
again
for
the
disturbed
districts
mind
and
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
proctors
said
jervis
as
much
row
as
you
please
but
we
must
be
caught
again
well
only
let
keep
together
if
we
have
to
bolt
they
promenaded
in
lonely
dignity
for
some
five
minutes
keeping
eyes
and
ears
on
full
strain
i
tell
you
what
said
drysdale
at
last
it
is
fair
these
enemies
in
the
camp
what
with
the
and
their
stones
and
fists
and
the
proctors
with
their
and
college
we
got
the
wrong
end
of
the
stick
both
wrong
ends
i
can
tell
you
said
jervis
hello
brown
your
nose
is
bleeding
is
it
said
tom
drawing
his
hand
across
his
mouth
was
that
confounded
little
fellow
then
who
ran
up
to
my
side
while
i
was
squaring
at
the
long
party
i
felt
a
sharp
crack
and
the
little
rascal
bolted
into
the
crowd
before
i
could
turn
at
him
cut
and
come
again
said
drysdale
laughing
ay
that
the
regular
thing
in
these
blackguard
street
squabbles
here
they
come
then
said
jervis
steady
all
they
turned
around
to
face
the
town
which
came
shouting
down
the
street
behind
them
in
pursuit
of
one
gownsman
a
little
harmless
quiet
fellow
who
had
fallen
them
on
his
way
back
to
his
college
from
a
tea
with
his
tutor
and
like
a
wise
man
was
giving
them
as
hard
as
he
could
foot
it
but
the
little
man
was
of
a
courageous
though
prudent
soul
and
turned
panting
and
gasping
on
his
foes
the
moment
he
found
himself
amongst
friends
again
now
then
stick
together
do
let
them
get
around
us
said
jervis
they
walked
steadily
down
the
street
which
was
luckily
a
narrow
one
so
that
three
of
them
could
keep
the
whole
of
it
halting
and
showing
front
every
few
yards
when
the
crowd
pressed
too
much
down
with
them
town
town
that
two
as
was
in
the
show
mark
the
chap
town
town
shouted
the
hinder
part
of
the
mob
but
it
was
a
rabble
of
boys
as
before
and
the
front
rank
took
very
good
care
of
itself
and
forbore
from
close
quarters
the
small
gownsman
had
now
got
his
wind
again
and
smarting
under
the
ignominy
of
his
recent
flight
was
always
a
pace
or
two
nearer
the
crowd
than
the
other
three
ruffling
up
like
a
little
bantam
and
shouting
defiance
between
the
catchings
of
his
breath
you
vagabonds
you
cowards
come
on
now
i
say
gown
gown
and
at
last
emboldened
by
the
repeated
halts
of
the
mob
and
thirsting
for
revenge
he
made
a
dash
at
one
of
the
nearest
of
the
enemy
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
took
both
sides
by
surprise
then
came
a
rush
by
two
or
three
of
the
town
to
the
rescue
no
no
stand
back
one
at
a
time
shouted
the
captain
throwing
himself
between
the
combatants
and
the
mob
go
it
little
serve
him
out
keep
the
rest
back
boys
steady
tom
and
drysdale
faced
towards
the
crowd
while
a
little
gownsman
and
his
antagonist
who
defended
himself
vigorously
enough
now
came
to
close
quarters
in
the
rear
of
the
gown
line
too
close
to
hurt
one
another
but
what
with
hugging
and
cuffing
the
townsman
in
another
was
sitting
quietly
on
the
pavement
with
his
back
against
the
wall
his
enemy
squaring
in
front
of
him
and
daring
him
to
renew
the
combat
get
up
you
coward
get
up
i
say
you
coward
he
wo
get
up
said
the
little
man
eagerly
turning
to
the
captain
shall
i
give
him
a
kick
no
let
the
cur
alone
replied
jervis
now
do
any
more
of
you
want
to
fight
come
on
like
men
one
at
a
time
i
fight
any
man
in
the
crowd
whether
the
challenge
would
have
been
answered
must
rest
uncertain
for
now
the
crowd
began
to
look
back
and
a
cry
arose
here
they
are
proctors
now
they
run
so
we
must
by
jove
brown
said
the
captain
what
your
college
to
the
little
hero
pembroke
cut
away
then
you
close
at
home
very
well
if
i
must
good
night
and
away
went
the
small
man
as
fast
as
he
had
come
and
it
has
never
been
heard
that
he
came
to
further
grief
or
performed
other
feats
that
night
hang
it
do
let
run
said
drysdale
is
it
the
proctors
said
tom
i
ca
see
them
mark
the
one
kick
him
over
sang
out
a
voice
in
the
crowd
said
tom
savagely
let
have
one
rush
at
them
look
there
the
proctor
cap
just
through
them
come
along
boys
well
stay
if
you
like
and
be
rusticated
i
off
and
away
went
jervis
and
the
next
moment
tom
and
drysdale
followed
the
good
example
and
as
they
had
to
run
made
the
best
use
of
their
legs
and
in
two
minutes
were
well
ahead
of
their
pursuers
they
turned
a
corner
here
brown
alight
in
this
public
cut
in
and
it
all
right
next
moment
they
were
in
the
dark
passage
of
a
quiet
little
inn
and
heard
with
a
chuckle
part
of
the
crowd
scurry
by
the
door
in
pursuit
while
they
themselves
suddenly
appeared
in
the
neat
little
bar
to
the
no
small
astonishment
of
its
occupants
these
were
a
stout
elderly
woman
in
spectacles
who
was
stitching
away
at
plain
work
in
an
on
one
side
of
the
fire
the
foreman
of
one
of
the
great
who
sat
opposite
her
smoking
his
pipe
with
a
long
glass
of
clear
ale
at
his
elbow
and
a
neat
handed
bar
maid
who
was
leaning
against
the
table
and
talking
to
the
others
as
they
entered
chapter
xii
the
captain
notions
the
old
lady
dropped
her
work
the
barmaid
turned
round
with
a
start
and
little
ejaculation
and
the
foreman
stared
with
all
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
then
jumping
up
exclaimed
bless
us
if
it
is
muster
drysdale
and
muster
brown
of
ambrose
why
what
the
matter
sir
muster
brown
you
be
all
covered
wi
blood
sir
oh
dear
me
poor
young
gentlemen
cried
the
hostess
here
patty
run
and
tell
dick
to
go
for
the
doctor
and
get
the
best
room
no
please
do
it
nothing
at
all
interrupted
tom
laughing
a
basin
of
cold
water
and
a
towel
if
you
please
miss
patty
and
i
shall
be
quite
presentable
in
a
minute
very
sorry
to
have
frightened
you
all
drysdale
joined
in
the
assurances
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
little
of
his
friend
claret
which
he
would
be
all
the
better
for
losing
and
watched
with
an
envious
eye
the
interest
depicted
in
patty
pretty
face
as
she
hurried
in
with
a
basin
of
fresh
pumped
water
and
held
the
towel
tom
bathed
his
face
and
very
soon
was
as
respectable
a
member
of
society
as
usual
save
for
a
slight
swelling
on
one
side
of
his
nose
drysdale
meantime
seated
on
the
table
had
been
explaining
the
circumstances
to
the
landlady
and
the
foreman
and
now
said
he
as
tom
joined
them
and
seated
himself
on
a
vacant
chair
i
sure
you
must
draw
famous
ale
indeed
sir
i
think
dick
that
my
ostler
sir
is
as
good
a
brewer
as
is
in
the
town
we
always
brew
at
home
sir
and
i
hope
always
shall
quite
right
quite
right
said
drysdale
and
i
think
we
can
do
better
than
follow
jem
here
let
us
have
a
jug
of
the
same
ale
as
he
is
drinking
and
you
take
a
glass
with
us
jem
or
will
you
have
spirits
jem
was
for
another
glass
of
ale
and
bore
witness
to
its
being
the
best
in
oxford
and
patty
drew
the
ale
and
supplied
two
more
long
glasses
drysdale
with
apologies
produced
his
cigar
case
and
jem
under
the
influence
of
the
ale
and
a
havannah
for
which
he
deserted
his
pipe
though
he
did
not
enjoy
it
half
as
much
volunteered
to
go
and
rouse
the
yard
and
conduct
them
safely
back
to
college
this
offer
was
of
course
politely
declined
and
then
jem
hour
for
bed
having
come
he
being
a
methodical
man
as
became
his
position
departed
and
left
our
two
young
friends
in
sole
possession
of
the
bar
nothing
could
have
suited
the
two
young
gentlemen
better
and
they
set
to
work
to
make
themselves
agreeable
they
listened
with
lively
interest
to
the
landlady
statement
of
the
difficulties
of
a
widow
woman
in
a
house
like
hers
and
to
her
praises
of
her
factotum
dick
and
her
niece
patty
they
applauded
her
resolution
of
not
bringing
up
her
two
boys
in
the
publican
line
though
they
could
offer
no
very
available
answer
her
appeals
for
advice
as
to
what
trade
they
should
be
put
to
all
trades
were
so
full
and
things
were
not
as
they
ought
to
be
the
one
thing
apparently
which
was
wanting
to
the
happiness
of
drysdale
at
oxford
was
the
discovery
of
such
beer
as
he
had
at
last
found
at
the
choughs
dick
was
to
come
up
to
ambrose
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
carry
off
his
barrel
which
would
never
contain
in
future
any
other
liquid
at
last
that
worthy
appeared
in
the
bar
to
know
when
he
was
to
shut
up
and
was
sent
out
by
his
mistress
to
see
that
the
street
was
clear
for
which
service
he
received
a
shilling
though
his
offer
of
escort
was
declined
and
so
after
paying
in
a
splendid
manner
for
their
entertainment
they
found
themselves
in
the
street
and
set
off
for
college
agreeing
on
the
way
that
the
choughs
was
a
great
find
the
old
lady
was
the
best
old
soul
in
the
world
and
patty
the
prettiest
girl
in
oxford
they
found
the
streets
quiet
and
walking
quickly
along
them
knocked
at
the
college
gates
at
eleven
the
stout
porter
received
them
with
a
long
face
senior
proctor
sent
down
here
an
hour
back
gentlemen
to
find
whether
you
was
in
college
you
do
mean
that
porter
how
kind
of
him
what
did
you
say
said
i
did
know
sir
but
the
marshal
said
if
you
come
in
after
that
you
was
to
go
to
the
senior
proctor
at
nine
send
my
compliments
to
the
senior
proctor
said
drysdale
and
say
i
have
a
very
particular
engagement
to
morrow
morning
which
will
prevent
my
having
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
him
very
good
sir
said
the
porter
giving
a
little
dry
chuckle
and
tapping
the
keys
against
his
leg
only
perhaps
you
mind
writing
him
a
note
sir
as
he
is
rather
a
particular
gentleman
did
he
send
after
anyone
else
said
tom
yes
sir
jervis
sir
well
and
what
about
him
oh
sir
jervis
an
old
hand
sir
he
been
in
gates
long
time
sir
when
the
marshal
came
the
sly
old
beggar
said
drysdale
good
night
porter
mind
you
send
my
message
to
the
proctor
if
he
is
set
on
seeing
me
you
can
say
that
he
will
find
a
broiled
chicken
and
a
hand
at
picquet
in
my
rooms
if
he
likes
to
drop
in
to
lunch
the
porter
looked
after
them
for
a
moment
and
then
retired
to
his
deep
old
chair
in
the
lodge
pulled
his
night
cap
over
his
ears
put
up
his
feet
before
the
fire
on
a
high
stool
and
folded
his
hands
on
his
lap
the
most
impidentest
thing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
is
it
in
his
first
year
soliloquized
the
little
man
ha
done
that
one
a
sight
of
good
now
if
he
got
a
good
hiding
in
the
street
but
he
better
than
most
on
too
he
went
on
uncommon
free
with
his
tongue
but
just
as
free
with
his
well
i
not
going
to
peach
if
the
proctor
do
send
again
in
the
morning
that
sort
good
for
the
college
makes
things
brisk
has
his
from
town
and
do
keep
no
keys
i
wonder
now
if
my
peter
been
out
a
fighting
he
pretty
nigh
as
hard
to
manage
is
that
boy
as
if
he
was
at
college
hisself
and
so
muttering
over
his
domestic
and
professional
grievances
the
small
janitor
composed
himself
to
a
nap
i
may
add
parenthetically
that
his
hopeful
peter
a
precocious
youth
of
seventeen
scout
boy
on
no
staircase
of
college
was
represented
in
the
boot
cleaning
and
errand
line
by
a
substitute
for
some
days
and
when
he
returned
to
duty
was
minus
a
front
tooth
what
fools
we
were
not
to
stick
to
the
captain
i
wonder
what
we
shall
get
said
tom
who
was
troubled
in
his
mind
at
the
proctor
message
and
not
gifted
naturally
with
the
recklessness
and
contempt
of
authority
which
in
drysdale
case
approached
the
sublime
who
cares
i
be
bound
now
the
old
fox
came
straight
home
to
earth
let
go
and
knock
him
up
tom
assented
for
he
was
anxious
to
consult
jervis
as
to
his
proceedings
in
the
morning
so
they
soon
found
themselves
drumming
at
his
oak
which
was
opened
shortly
by
the
stroke
in
an
old
they
followed
him
in
at
one
end
of
his
table
stood
his
and
the
remains
of
his
commons
which
the
scout
had
not
cleared
away
at
the
other
open
books
and
maps
showed
that
the
captain
read
as
he
rowed
hard
all
well
are
you
two
only
just
in
only
just
my
captain
answered
drysdale
have
you
been
well
thrashed
then
you
do
look
much
damaged
we
are
innocent
of
fight
since
your
sudden
departure
flight
shall
i
call
it
my
captain
where
have
you
been
where
why
in
the
paragon
of
all
pot
houses
snug
little
bar
with
red
curtains
stout
old
benevolent
female
in
spectacles
barmaid
an
houri
and
for
malt
the
most
touching
tap
in
oxford
was
it
brown
yes
the
beer
was
undeniable
said
tom
well
and
you
dawdled
there
till
now
said
jervis
even
so
what
with
mobs
that
would
fight
fair
the
captains
who
would
run
away
and
the
proctors
marshals
who
would
interfere
we
were
disgusted
with
the
whole
proceedings
as
the
scotchman
said
when
he
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
well
heaven
they
say
protects
children
sailors
and
drunken
men
and
whatever
answer
to
heaven
in
the
academical
system
protects
freshmen
remarked
jervis
not
us
at
any
rate
said
tom
for
we
are
to
go
to
the
proctor
morning
what
did
he
catch
you
in
your
famous
public
no
the
marshal
came
round
to
the
porter
lodge
asked
if
we
were
in
and
left
word
that
if
we
were
not
we
were
to
go
to
him
in
the
morning
the
porter
told
us
just
now
as
we
came
in
pshaw
said
the
captain
with
disgust
now
you
be
gated
probably
and
the
whole
crew
will
be
thrown
out
of
gear
why
could
you
have
come
home
when
i
did
we
do
not
propose
to
attend
the
levee
of
that
excellent
person
in
office
morning
said
drysdale
he
will
forget
all
about
it
old
copas
wo
say
a
word
catch
him
he
gets
too
much
out
of
me
for
that
well
you
see
i
back
the
proctor
memory
but
captain
what
are
you
going
to
stand
stand
nothing
unless
you
like
a
cup
of
cold
tea
you
get
no
wine
or
spirits
here
at
this
time
of
night
and
the
buttery
is
shut
besides
you
had
quite
as
much
beer
as
good
for
you
at
your
paragon
public
come
now
captain
just
two
glasses
of
sherry
and
i
promise
to
go
to
bed
not
a
thimbleful
you
old
tyrant
said
drysdale
hopping
off
his
perch
on
the
elbow
of
the
sofa
come
along
brown
let
go
and
draw
for
some
supper
and
a
hand
at
van
john
there
sure
to
be
something
going
up
my
staircase
or
at
any
rate
there
a
cool
bottle
of
claret
in
my
rooms
stop
and
have
a
talk
brown
said
the
captain
and
prevailed
against
drysdale
who
after
another
attempt
to
draw
tom
off
departed
on
his
quest
for
drink
and
cards
he
never
do
for
the
boat
i
afraid
said
the
captain
with
his
rascally
late
hours
and
drinking
and
eating
all
sorts
of
trash
it
a
pity
too
for
he
a
pretty
oar
for
his
weight
he
is
such
uncommon
good
company
too
said
tom
yes
but
i
tell
you
what
he
just
a
leetle
too
good
company
for
you
and
me
or
any
fellows
who
mean
to
take
a
degree
see
this
is
only
his
third
term
i
give
him
perhaps
two
more
to
make
the
place
too
hot
to
hold
him
take
my
word
for
it
he
never
get
to
his
it
will
be
a
great
pity
then
said
tom
so
it
will
but
after
all
you
see
what
does
it
matter
to
him
he
gets
rusticated
takes
his
name
off
with
a
flourish
of
trumpets
what
then
he
falls
back
on
a
year
in
land
and
a
good
accumulation
in
consols
runs
abroad
or
lives
in
town
for
a
year
takes
the
hounds
when
he
comes
of
age
or
is
singled
out
by
some
discerning
constituency
and
sent
to
make
laws
for
his
country
having
spent
the
whole
of
his
life
hitherto
in
breaking
all
the
laws
he
ever
came
under
you
and
i
perhaps
go
fooling
about
with
him
and
get
rusticated
we
make
our
friends
miserable
we
ca
take
our
names
off
but
have
to
come
cringing
back
at
the
end
of
our
year
marked
men
keep
our
tails
between
our
legs
for
the
rest
of
the
time
lose
a
year
at
our
professions
and
most
likely
have
the
slip
casting
up
against
us
in
one
way
or
another
for
the
next
twenty
years
it
like
the
old
story
of
the
giant
and
the
dwarf
or
like
fighting
a
sweep
or
any
other
business
but
i
sooner
have
to
fight
my
own
way
in
the
world
after
all
would
you
said
tom
said
the
captain
throwing
himself
back
in
the
chair
and
smiling
ca
answer
off
hand
i
a
third
year
man
and
begin
to
see
the
other
side
rather
clearer
than
i
did
when
i
was
a
freshman
like
you
three
years
at
oxford
my
boy
will
teach
you
something
of
what
rank
and
money
count
for
if
they
teach
you
nothing
else
why
here
the
captain
singing
the
same
song
as
hardy
thought
tom
so
you
two
have
to
go
to
the
proctor
yes
shall
you
go
drysdale
wo
of
course
i
shall
it
seems
to
me
childish
not
to
go
as
if
i
were
back
in
the
lower
school
again
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
being
sent
for
is
pleasant
but
the
other
i
could
stand
well
i
do
feel
anything
of
that
sort
but
i
think
right
on
the
whole
the
chances
are
that
he
remember
your
name
and
send
for
you
again
if
you
do
go
and
then
you
be
worse
off
you
do
think
he
rusticate
us
or
anything
of
that
sort
said
tom
who
had
felt
horrible
twinges
at
the
captain
picture
of
the
effects
of
rustication
on
ordinary
mortals
no
not
unless
he
in
a
very
bad
humour
i
was
caught
three
times
in
one
night
in
my
freshman
term
and
only
got
an
imposition
then
i
do
care
said
tom
but
it
a
bore
to
have
been
caught
in
so
seedy
an
affair
if
it
had
been
a
real
good
row
one
would
have
minded
so
much
why
what
did
you
expect
it
was
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
common
run
of
such
things
well
but
three
parts
of
the
crowd
were
boys
so
they
are
always
or
nine
times
out
of
ten
at
any
rate
but
there
was
no
real
fighting
at
least
i
only
know
i
got
none
there
is
any
real
fighting
as
you
call
it
nine
times
out
of
ten
what
is
there
then
why
something
of
this
sort
five
shopboys
or
scouts
boys
full
of
sauciness
loitering
at
an
street
corner
enter
two
freshmen
full
of
dignity
and
bad
wine
explosion
of
inflammable
material
freshmen
mobbed
into
or
where
the
tables
are
turned
by
a
gathering
of
many
more
freshmen
and
the
mob
of
town
boys
quietly
subsides
puts
its
hands
in
its
pockets
and
ceases
to
shout
town
the
triumphant
freshmen
march
up
and
down
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
shouting
gown
and
looking
furious
but
not
half
sorry
that
the
mob
vanishes
like
mist
at
their
approach
then
come
the
proctors
who
hunt
down
and
break
up
the
gown
in
some
or
hour
the
again
marches
about
in
the
ascendant
and
mobs
the
scattered
freshmen
wherever
they
can
be
caught
in
very
small
numbers
but
with
all
your
chaff
about
freshmen
captain
you
were
in
it
yourself
come
now
of
course
i
had
to
look
after
you
two
boys
but
you
did
know
we
were
in
when
you
came
up
i
was
sure
to
find
some
of
you
besides
i
admit
one
like
to
go
in
while
there
any
chance
of
a
real
row
as
you
call
it
and
so
gets
proctorized
in
one
old
age
for
patriotism
were
you
ever
in
a
real
row
said
tom
yes
once
about
a
year
ago
the
fighting
numbers
were
about
equal
and
the
town
all
grown
men
labourers
and
mechanics
it
was
desperate
hard
work
none
of
your
shouting
and
promenading
that
hardy
one
of
our
bible
clerks
fought
like
a
paladin
i
know
i
shifted
a
fellow
in
corduroys
on
to
him
whom
i
had
found
an
uncommon
tough
customer
and
never
felt
better
pleased
in
my
life
than
when
i
saw
the
light
glance
on
his
hobnails
as
he
went
over
into
the
gutter
two
minutes
afterwards
it
lasted
perhaps
ten
minutes
and
both
sides
were
very
glad
to
draw
off
but
of
course
you
licked
them
we
said
we
did
well
i
believe
that
a
gentleman
will
always
lick
in
a
fair
fight
of
course
you
do
it
the
orthodox
belief
but
do
you
yes
if
he
is
as
big
and
strong
and
knows
how
to
fight
as
well
as
the
other
the
odds
are
that
he
cares
a
little
more
for
giving
in
and
that
will
pull
him
through
that
is
saying
much
though
no
but
it
quite
as
much
as
is
true
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
think
just
this
that
we
are
generally
better
in
the
fighting
way
than
shopkeepers
clerks
flunkies
and
all
fellows
who
work
hard
with
their
bodies
all
day
but
the
moment
you
come
to
the
real
fellow
used
to
nine
or
ten
hours
work
a
day
he
a
cruel
hard
customer
take
seventy
or
eighty
of
them
at
haphazard
the
first
you
meet
and
turn
them
into
ambrose
any
morning
by
night
i
take
it
they
would
be
lords
of
this
venerable
establishment
if
we
had
to
fight
for
the
possession
except
perhaps
for
that
hardy
he
one
of
a
thousand
and
was
born
for
a
fighting
man
perhaps
he
might
pull
us
through
why
do
you
try
him
in
the
boat
miller
manages
all
that
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
after
that
row
but
he
said
that
hardy
had
refused
to
subscribe
to
the
club
said
he
could
afford
it
or
something
of
the
sort
i
do
see
why
that
need
matter
myself
but
i
suppose
as
we
have
rules
we
ought
to
stick
to
them
it
a
great
pity
though
i
know
hardy
well
and
you
ca
think
what
a
fine
fellow
he
is
i
sure
of
that
i
tried
to
know
him
and
we
do
get
on
badly
as
speaking
acquaintance
but
he
seems
a
queer
solitary
bird
twelve
struck
so
tom
wished
the
captain
good
night
and
departed
meditating
much
on
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
the
vision
of
terrible
single
combats
in
which
the
descendant
of
a
hundred
earls
polishes
off
the
huge
representative
of
the
masses
in
the
most
finished
style
without
a
scratch
on
his
own
aristocratic
features
had
faded
from
his
mind
he
went
to
bed
that
night
fairly
sickened
with
his
experience
of
a
town
and
gown
row
and
with
a
nasty
taste
in
his
mouth
but
he
felt
much
pleased
at
having
drawn
out
the
captain
so
completely
for
the
stroke
was
in
general
a
man
of
marvellous
few
words
having
many
better
uses
than
talking
to
put
his
breath
to
next
morning
he
attended
at
the
proctor
rooms
at
the
appointed
time
not
without
some
feeling
of
shame
at
having
to
do
so
which
however
wore
off
when
he
found
some
dozen
men
of
other
colleges
waiting
about
on
the
same
errand
as
himself
in
his
turn
he
was
ushered
in
and
as
he
stood
by
the
door
had
time
to
look
the
great
man
over
as
he
sat
making
a
note
of
the
case
he
had
just
disposed
of
the
inspection
was
reassuring
the
proctor
was
a
gentlemanly
looking
man
of
about
thirty
not
at
all
donnish
and
his
address
answered
to
his
appearance
brown
of
ambrose
i
think
he
said
yes
sir
i
sent
you
to
your
college
yesterday
evening
did
you
go
straight
home
no
sir
how
was
that
mr
brown
tom
made
no
answer
and
the
proctor
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
repeated
how
was
that
well
sir
said
tom
i
do
mean
to
say
i
was
going
straight
to
college
but
i
should
have
been
in
long
before
you
sent
only
i
fell
in
with
the
mob
again
and
then
there
was
a
cry
that
you
were
coming
and
he
paused
well
said
the
proctor
with
a
grim
sort
of
curl
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
why
i
ran
away
and
turned
into
the
first
place
which
was
open
and
stopped
till
the
streets
were
quiet
a
public
house
i
suppose
yes
sir
choughs
the
proctor
considered
a
minute
and
again
scrutinized
tom
look
and
manner
which
certainly
were
straightforward
and
without
any
tinge
of
cringing
or
insolence
how
long
have
you
been
up
this
is
my
second
term
sir
you
have
never
been
sent
to
me
before
i
think
never
sir
well
i
ca
overlook
this
as
you
yourself
confess
to
a
direct
act
of
disobedience
you
must
write
me
out
lines
of
virgil
and
now
brown
let
me
advise
you
to
keep
out
of
disreputable
street
quarrels
in
future
good
morning
tom
hurried
away
wondering
what
it
would
feel
like
to
be
writing
out
virgil
again
as
a
punishment
at
his
time
of
life
but
glad
above
measure
that
the
proctor
had
asked
him
no
questions
about
his
companion
the
hero
was
of
course
mightily
tickled
at
the
result
and
seized
the
occasion
to
lecture
tom
on
his
future
conduct
holding
himself
up
as
a
living
example
of
the
benefits
which
were
sure
to
accrue
to
a
man
who
never
did
anything
he
was
told
to
do
the
soundness
of
his
reasoning
however
was
somewhat
shaken
by
the
dean
who
on
the
same
afternoon
managed
to
catch
him
in
quad
and
carrying
him
off
discoursed
with
him
concerning
his
various
and
systematic
breaches
of
discipline
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
had
already
made
such
good
use
of
his
time
that
if
he
were
to
be
discommonsed
for
three
more
days
he
would
lose
his
term
and
then
took
of
his
cross
gave
him
a
book
of
virgil
to
write
out
and
gated
him
for
a
fortnight
after
hall
drysdale
sent
out
his
scout
to
order
his
punishment
as
he
might
have
ordered
a
waistcoat
presented
old
copas
with
a
and
then
dismissed
punishment
and
gating
from
his
mind
he
cultivated
with
great
success
the
science
of
mental
gymnastics
or
throwing
everything
the
least
unpleasant
off
his
mind
at
once
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
science
worthy
of
all
cultivation
if
one
desires
to
lead
a
comfortable
life
it
gets
harder
however
as
the
years
roll
over
us
to
attain
to
any
satisfactory
proficiency
in
it
so
it
should
be
mastered
as
early
in
life
as
may
be
the
town
and
gown
row
was
the
talk
of
the
college
for
the
next
week
tom
of
course
talked
much
about
it
like
his
neighbors
and
confided
to
one
and
another
the
captain
heresies
they
were
all
incredulous
for
no
one
had
ever
heard
him
talk
as
much
in
a
term
as
tom
reported
him
to
have
done
on
this
one
evening
so
it
was
resolved
that
he
should
be
taken
to
task
on
the
subject
on
the
first
opportunity
and
as
nobody
was
afraid
of
him
there
was
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
man
to
bell
the
cat
accordingly
at
the
next
wine
of
the
boating
set
the
captain
had
scarcely
entered
when
he
was
assailed
by
the
host
with
jervis
brown
says
you
do
believe
a
gentleman
can
lick
a
cad
unless
he
is
the
biggest
and
strongest
of
the
two
the
captain
who
hated
coming
out
with
his
beliefs
shrugged
his
shoulders
sipped
his
wine
and
tried
to
turn
the
subject
but
seeing
that
they
were
all
bent
on
drawing
him
out
he
was
not
the
man
to
run
from
his
guns
and
so
he
said
quietly
no
more
i
do
notwithstanding
the
reverence
in
which
he
was
held
this
saying
could
not
be
allowed
to
pass
and
a
dozen
voices
were
instantly
raised
and
a
dozen
authentic
stories
told
to
confute
him
he
listened
patiently
and
then
seeing
he
was
in
for
it
said
never
mind
fighting
try
something
else
cricket
for
instance
the
players
generally
beat
the
gentlemen
do
they
yes
but
they
are
professionals
well
and
we
do
often
get
a
university
crew
which
can
beat
the
watermen
professionals
again
i
believe
the
markers
are
the
best
ai
they
persevered
the
captain
and
i
generally
find
keepers
and
huntsmen
shooting
and
riding
better
than
their
master
you
but
that
not
fair
all
the
cases
you
put
are
those
of
men
who
have
nothing
else
to
do
who
live
by
the
things
gentlemen
only
take
up
for
pleasure
i
only
say
that
the
cads
as
you
call
them
manage
somehow
or
another
to
do
them
best
said
the
captain
how
about
the
army
and
navy
the
officers
always
lead
well
there
they
all
professionals
at
any
rate
said
the
captain
i
admit
that
the
officers
lead
but
the
men
follow
pretty
close
and
in
a
forlorn
hope
there
are
fifty
men
to
one
officer
after
all
but
they
must
be
led
the
men
will
never
go
without
an
officer
to
lead
it
the
officers
business
to
lead
i
know
and
they
do
it
but
you
wo
find
the
best
judges
talking
as
if
the
men
wanted
much
leading
read
napier
the
finest
story
in
his
book
is
of
the
sergeant
who
gave
his
life
for
his
boy
officer
your
namesake
brown
at
the
coa
well
i
never
thought
to
hear
you
crying
down
gentlemen
i
not
crying
down
gentlemen
said
the
captain
i
only
say
that
a
gentleman
flesh
and
blood
and
brains
are
just
the
same
and
no
better
than
another
man
he
has
all
the
chances
on
his
side
in
the
way
of
training
and
pretty
near
all
the
prizes
so
it
would
be
hard
if
he
did
do
most
things
better
than
poor
men
but
give
them
the
chance
of
training
and
they
will
tread
on
his
heels
soon
enough
that
all
i
say
that
was
all
certainly
that
the
captain
said
and
then
relapsed
into
his
usual
monosyllabic
state
from
which
all
the
eager
talk
of
the
men
who
took
up
the
cudgels
naturally
enough
for
their
own
class
and
talked
themselves
before
the
wine
broke
up
into
a
renewed
consciousness
of
their
natural
superiority
failed
again
to
rouse
him
this
was
in
fact
the
captain
weak
point
if
he
had
one
he
had
strong
beliefs
himself
one
of
the
strongest
of
which
was
that
nobody
could
be
taught
anything
except
by
his
own
experience
so
he
never
or
very
rarely
exercised
his
own
personal
influence
but
just
quietly
went
on
his
own
way
and
let
other
men
go
theirs
another
of
his
beliefs
was
that
there
was
no
man
or
thing
in
the
world
too
bad
to
be
tolerated
faithfully
acting
up
to
which
belief
the
captain
himself
tolerated
persons
and
things
intolerable
bearing
which
facts
in
mind
the
reader
will
easily
guess
the
result
of
the
application
which
the
crew
duly
made
to
him
the
day
after
miller
back
was
turned
he
simply
said
that
the
training
they
proposed
would
not
be
enough
and
that
he
himself
should
take
all
who
chose
to
go
down
to
abingdon
twice
a
week
from
that
time
there
were
many
defaulters
and
the
spirit
of
diogenes
groaned
within
him
as
day
after
day
the
crew
had
to
be
filled
up
from
the
torpid
or
by
watermen
drysdale
would
ride
down
to
sandford
meeting
the
boat
on
its
way
up
and
then
take
his
place
for
the
pull
up
to
oxford
while
his
groom
rode
his
horse
up
to
folly
bridge
to
meet
him
there
he
would
mount
again
and
ride
off
to
bullingdon
or
to
the
isis
or
quentin
or
other
social
meeting
equally
inimical
to
good
training
blake
often
absented
himself
three
days
in
a
week
and
other
men
once
or
twice
from
considering
which
facts
tom
came
to
understand
the
difference
between
his
two
heroes
their
strong
likeness
in
many
points
he
had
seen
from
the
first
they
were
alike
in
truthfulness
bravery
bodily
strength
and
in
most
of
their
opinions
but
jervis
worried
himself
about
nothing
and
let
all
men
and
things
alone
in
the
belief
that
the
world
was
not
going
so
very
wrong
or
would
right
itself
somehow
without
him
hardy
on
the
other
hand
was
consuming
his
heart
over
everything
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
going
wrong
in
himself
and
round
about
him
in
the
college
in
oxford
in
england
in
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
never
letting
slip
a
chance
of
trying
to
set
right
here
a
thread
and
there
a
thread
a
much
enduring
man
a
slayer
of
dragons
himself
and
one
with
whom
you
could
not
live
much
without
getting
uncomfortably
aware
of
the
dragons
which
you
also
had
to
slay
what
wonder
that
apart
altogether
from
the
difference
in
their
social
position
the
one
man
was
ever
becoming
more
and
more
popular
while
the
other
was
left
more
and
more
to
himself
there
are
few
of
us
at
oxford
or
elsewhere
who
do
not
like
to
see
a
man
living
a
brave
and
righteous
life
so
long
as
he
keeps
clear
of
us
and
still
fewer
who
like
to
be
in
constant
contact
with
one
who
not
content
with
so
living
himself
is
always
coming
across
them
and
laying
bare
to
them
their
own
and
sloth
and
meanness
the
latter
no
doubt
inspires
the
deeper
feeling
and
lays
hold
with
a
firmer
grip
of
the
men
he
does
lay
hold
of
but
they
are
few
for
men
always
keep
up
to
high
pressure
till
they
have
found
firm
ground
to
build
upon
altogether
outside
of
themselves
and
it
is
hard
to
be
thankful
and
fair
to
those
who
are
showing
us
time
after
time
that
our
foothold
is
nothing
but
shifting
sand
the
contrast
between
jervis
and
hardy
now
began
to
force
itself
daily
more
and
more
on
our
hero
attention
from
the
night
of
the
town
and
gown
row
the
choughs
became
a
regular
haunt
of
the
crew
who
were
taken
there
under
the
guidance
of
tom
and
drysdale
the
next
day
not
content
with
calling
there
on
his
way
from
the
boats
there
was
seldom
an
evening
now
that
tom
did
not
manage
to
drop
in
and
spend
an
hour
there
when
one
is
very
much
bent
on
doing
a
thing
it
is
generally
easy
enough
to
find
very
good
reasons
or
excuses
at
any
rate
for
it
and
whenever
any
doubts
crossed
tom
mind
he
silenced
them
by
the
reflection
that
the
time
he
spent
at
the
choughs
would
otherwise
have
been
devoted
to
wine
parties
or
billiards
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
persuade
himself
that
his
present
occupation
was
the
more
wholesome
of
the
two
he
could
not
however
feel
satisfied
till
he
had
mentioned
his
change
in
life
to
hardy
this
he
found
a
much
more
embarrassing
matter
than
he
fancied
it
would
be
but
after
one
or
two
false
starts
he
managed
to
get
out
that
he
had
found
the
best
glass
of
ale
in
oxford
at
a
quiet
little
public
on
the
way
to
the
boats
kept
by
the
most
perfect
of
widows
with
a
factotum
of
an
ostler
who
was
a
regular
character
and
that
he
went
there
most
evenings
for
an
hour
or
so
would
hardy
come
some
night
no
hardy
could
spare
the
time
tom
felt
rather
relieved
at
this
answer
but
nevertheless
went
on
to
urge
the
excellence
of
the
ale
as
a
further
inducement
i
do
believe
it
half
so
good
as
our
college
beer
and
be
bound
it
half
as
dear
again
only
a
penny
a
pint
dearer
said
tom
that
wo
ruin
you
all
the
crew
go
there
if
i
were
the
captain
said
hardy
i
would
let
you
run
about
drinking
ale
at
night
after
wine
parties
does
he
know
about
it
yes
and
goes
there
himself
often
on
the
way
from
the
boats
said
tom
and
at
night
too
said
hardy
no
said
tom
but
i
do
go
there
after
drinking
wine
i
have
been
to
a
wine
these
ten
days
at
least
not
for
more
than
five
minutes
well
sound
ale
is
better
than
oxford
wine
said
hardy
if
you
must
drink
something
and
so
the
subject
dropped
and
tom
went
away
satisfied
that
hardy
had
not
disapproved
of
his
new
habit
it
certainly
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
omitted
all
mention
of
the
pretty
barmaid
in
his
enumeration
of
the
attractions
of
the
choughs
but
he
set
down
to
mere
accident
it
was
a
slip
which
he
would
set
right
in
their
next
talk
but
that
talk
never
came
and
the
subject
was
not
again
mentioned
between
them
in
fact
to
tell
the
truth
tom
visits
to
his
friend
rooms
in
the
evenings
became
shorter
and
less
frequent
as
the
choughs
absorbed
more
and
more
of
his
time
he
made
excuses
to
himself
that
hardy
must
be
glad
of
more
time
and
would
be
only
bored
if
he
kept
dropping
in
every
night
now
that
the
examination
for
degree
was
so
near
that
he
was
sure
he
drove
grey
away
who
would
be
of
much
more
use
to
hardy
just
now
these
and
many
other
equally
plausible
reasons
suggested
themselves
whenever
his
conscience
smote
him
for
his
neglect
as
it
did
not
seldom
but
he
always
managed
to
satisfy
himself
somehow
without
admitting
the
real
fact
that
these
visits
were
no
longer
what
they
had
been
to
him
that
a
gulf
had
sprung
up
and
was
widening
day
by
day
between
him
and
the
only
friend
who
would
have
had
the
courage
and
honesty
to
tell
him
the
truth
about
his
new
pursuit
meantime
hardy
was
much
pained
at
the
change
in
his
friend
which
saw
quickly
enough
and
often
thought
over
it
with
a
sigh
as
he
sat
at
his
solitary
tea
he
set
it
down
to
his
own
dullness
to
the
number
of
new
friends
such
a
sociable
fellow
as
tom
was
sure
to
make
and
who
of
course
would
take
up
more
and
more
of
his
time
and
if
he
felt
a
little
jealousy
every
now
and
then
put
it
resolutely
back
struggling
to
think
no
evil
or
if
there
were
any
to
lay
it
on
his
own
shoulders
cribbage
is
a
most
virtuous
and
respectable
game
and
yet
scarcely
one
would
think
possessing
in
itself
sufficient
attractions
to
keep
a
young
gentleman
in
his
twentieth
year
tied
to
the
board
and
going
through
the
quaint
calculation
night
after
night
of
fifteen
two
fifteen
four
two
for
his
nob
and
one
for
his
heels
the
old
lady
of
the
choughs
liked
nothing
so
much
as
her
game
of
cribbage
in
the
evenings
and
the
board
lay
ready
on
the
little
table
by
her
elbow
in
the
cozy
bar
a
sure
to
her
good
graces
tom
somehow
became
an
enthusiast
in
cribbage
and
would
always
loiter
behind
his
companions
for
his
quiet
game
chatting
pleasantly
while
the
old
lady
cut
and
shuffled
the
dirty
pack
striving
keenly
for
the
nightly
stake
of
sixpence
which
he
seldom
failed
to
lose
and
laughingly
wrangling
with
her
over
the
last
points
in
the
game
which
decided
the
transfer
of
the
two
sixpences
duly
posted
in
the
beside
the
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
or
her
bag
until
she
would
take
off
her
spectacles
to
wipe
them
and
sink
back
in
her
chair
exhausted
with
the
pleasing
excitement
such
an
odd
taste
as
it
seemed
too
a
bystander
might
reasonably
have
thought
when
he
might
have
been
employing
his
time
so
much
more
pleasantly
in
the
very
room
for
flitting
in
and
out
of
the
bar
during
the
game
and
every
now
and
then
stooping
over
the
old
lady
shoulder
to
examine
her
hand
and
exchange
knowing
looks
with
her
was
the
lithe
little
figure
of
miss
patty
with
her
oval
race
and
merry
eyes
and
bright
brown
hair
and
jaunty
little
cap
with
fresh
blue
ribbons
of
the
shade
of
the
ambrose
colors
however
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
and
it
is
fortunate
that
some
like
apples
and
some
onions
it
may
possibly
be
too
that
miss
patty
did
not
feel
herself
neglected
or
did
not
care
about
attention
perhaps
she
may
not
have
been
altogether
unconscious
that
every
least
motion
and
word
of
hers
was
noticed
even
when
the
game
was
at
its
keenest
at
any
rate
it
was
clear
enough
that
she
and
tom
were
on
the
best
terms
though
she
always
took
her
aunt
part
vehemently
in
any
little
dispute
which
arose
and
sometimes
even
came
to
the
rescue
at
the
end
and
recaptured
the
vanished
sixpences
out
of
the
wrongful
grasp
which
he
generally
laid
on
them
the
moment
the
old
lady
held
out
her
hand
and
pronounced
the
word
game
one
knows
that
size
has
little
to
do
with
strength
or
one
might
have
wondered
that
her
little
hands
should
have
been
able
to
open
his
fingers
so
surely
one
by
one
though
he
seemed
to
do
all
he
could
to
keep
them
shut
but
after
all
if
he
really
thought
he
had
a
right
to
the
money
he
had
always
time
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
at
once
instead
of
keeping
his
clenched
hand
on
the
table
and
arguing
about
it
till
she
had
time
to
get
up
to
the
succour
of
her
aunt
chapter
xiii
the
first
bump
what
the
time
smith
three
old
fellow
answered
diogenes
looking
at
his
watch
i
never
knew
a
day
go
so
slowly
said
tom
is
it
time
to
go
down
to
the
boats
not
by
two
hours
and
more
old
fellow
ca
you
take
a
book
or
something
to
keep
you
quiet
you
wo
be
fit
for
anything
by
six
if
you
go
on
worrying
like
this
and
so
diogenes
turned
himself
to
his
flute
and
blew
away
to
all
appearances
as
composedly
as
if
it
had
been
the
first
week
of
term
though
if
the
truth
must
be
told
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
get
up
and
wander
about
in
a
feverish
and
distracted
state
for
restlessness
infected
him
diogenes
whole
heart
was
in
the
college
boat
and
so
though
he
had
pulled
dozens
of
races
in
his
time
he
was
almost
as
nervous
as
a
freshman
on
this
the
first
day
of
the
races
tom
all
unconscious
of
the
secret
discomposure
of
the
other
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
looked
at
him
with
wonder
and
envy
the
flute
went
toot
toot
toot
till
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
so
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
and
leaning
out
looked
up
and
down
the
street
for
some
minutes
in
a
purposeless
sort
of
fashion
staring
hard
at
everybody
and
everything
but
unconscious
all
the
time
that
he
was
doing
so
he
would
not
have
been
able
in
fact
to
answer
diogenes
a
word
had
not
that
worthy
inquired
of
him
what
he
had
seen
when
he
presently
drew
in
his
head
and
returned
to
his
fidgety
ramblings
about
the
room
how
hot
the
sun
is
but
there
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
i
hope
it
will
go
down
before
the
evening
you
yes
this
wind
will
make
it
very
rough
below
the
gut
mind
you
feather
high
now
at
starting
i
hope
to
goodness
i
catch
a
crab
said
tom
do
think
about
it
old
fellow
that
your
best
plan
but
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
said
tom
what
the
deuce
is
the
good
of
telling
a
fellow
not
to
think
about
it
diogenes
apparently
had
nothing
particular
to
reply
for
he
put
his
flute
to
his
mouth
again
and
at
the
sound
of
the
toot
toot
tom
caught
up
his
gown
and
fled
into
the
quadrangle
the
crew
had
had
their
early
dinner
of
steaks
and
chops
stale
bread
and
a
glass
and
a
half
of
old
beer
a
piece
at
two
in
the
captain
rooms
the
current
theory
of
training
at
that
time
was
as
much
meat
as
you
could
eat
the
more
underdone
the
better
and
the
smallest
amount
of
drink
upon
which
you
could
manage
to
live
two
pints
in
the
hours
was
all
that
most
boat
crews
that
pretended
to
train
at
all
were
allowed
and
for
the
last
fortnight
it
had
been
the
nominal
allowance
of
the
ambrose
crew
the
discomfort
of
such
a
diet
in
the
hot
summer
months
when
you
were
at
the
same
time
taking
regular
and
violent
exercise
was
something
very
serious
outraged
human
nature
rebelled
against
it
and
though
they
did
not
admit
it
in
public
there
were
very
few
men
who
did
not
rush
to
their
water
bottles
for
relief
more
or
less
often
according
to
the
development
of
their
bumps
of
conscientiousness
and
obstinacy
to
keep
to
the
diet
at
all
strictly
involved
a
very
respectable
amount
of
physical
endurance
our
successors
have
found
out
the
unwisdom
of
this
as
of
other
old
superstitions
and
that
in
order
to
get
a
man
into
training
for
a
it
is
not
of
the
first
importance
to
keep
him
in
a
constant
state
of
consuming
thirst
and
the
restlessness
of
body
and
sharpness
of
temper
which
thirst
generally
induces
tom
appreciated
the
honor
of
being
in
the
boat
in
his
first
year
so
keenly
that
he
had
almost
managed
to
keep
to
his
training
allowance
and
consequently
now
that
the
eventful
day
had
arrived
was
in
a
most
uncomfortable
frame
of
body
and
disagreeable
frame
of
mind
he
fled
away
from
diogenes
flute
but
found
no
rest
he
tried
drysdale
that
hero
was
lying
on
his
back
on
his
sofa
playing
with
jack
and
only
increased
tom
thirst
and
soured
his
temper
by
the
viciousness
of
his
remarks
on
boating
and
everything
and
person
connected
therewith
above
all
on
miller
who
had
just
come
up
had
steered
them
the
day
before
and
pronounced
the
crew
generally
and
drysdale
in
particular
not
half
trained
blake
oak
was
sported
as
usual
tom
looked
in
at
the
door
but
found
him
hard
at
work
reading
and
so
carried
himself
off
and
after
a
vain
hunt
after
others
of
the
crew
and
even
trying
to
sit
down
and
read
first
a
novel
then
a
play
of
shakespeare
with
no
success
whatever
wandered
away
out
of
the
college
and
found
himself
in
five
minutes
by
a
natural
and
irresistible
attraction
on
the
university
barge
there
were
half
a
dozen
men
or
so
reading
the
papers
and
a
group
or
two
discussing
the
coming
races
amongst
other
things
the
chances
of
ambrose
making
a
bump
the
first
night
were
weighed
every
one
joining
in
praising
the
stroke
but
there
were
great
doubts
whether
the
crew
could
live
up
to
it
tom
carried
himself
on
to
the
top
of
the
barge
to
get
out
of
hearing
for
listening
made
his
heart
beat
and
his
throat
drier
than
ever
he
stood
on
the
top
and
looked
right
away
down
to
the
gut
the
strong
wind
blowing
his
gown
about
not
even
a
pair
oar
was
to
be
seen
the
great
event
of
the
evening
made
the
river
a
solitude
at
this
time
of
day
only
one
or
two
skiffs
were
coming
home
impelled
by
reading
men
who
took
their
constitutionals
on
the
water
and
were
coming
in
to
be
in
time
for
afternoon
chapel
the
fastest
and
best
of
these
soon
came
near
enough
for
tom
to
recognize
hardy
stroke
so
he
left
the
barge
and
went
down
to
meet
the
servitor
at
his
landing
and
accompanied
him
to
the
ambrose
well
how
do
you
feel
for
the
race
said
hardy
as
he
dried
his
neck
and
face
which
he
had
been
sluicing
with
cold
water
looking
as
hardy
and
bright
as
a
racer
on
derby
day
oh
wretched
i
afraid
i
shall
break
down
said
tom
and
pouring
out
some
of
his
doubts
and
miseries
hardy
soon
comforted
him
greatly
and
by
the
time
they
were
half
across
christchurch
meadow
he
was
quite
in
heart
again
for
he
knew
how
well
hardy
understood
rowing
and
what
a
sound
judge
he
was
and
it
was
therefore
cheering
to
hear
that
he
thought
they
were
certainly
the
second
best
if
not
the
best
boat
on
the
river
and
that
they
would
be
sure
to
make
some
bumps
unless
they
had
accidents
but
that
just
what
i
fear
so
said
tom
i
afraid
i
shall
make
some
awful
blunder
not
you
said
hardy
only
remember
do
you
fancy
you
can
pull
the
boat
by
yourself
and
go
to
trying
to
do
it
where
young
oars
fail
if
you
keep
thorough
good
time
you
be
pretty
sure
to
be
doing
your
share
of
work
time
is
everything
almost
i
be
sure
to
think
of
that
said
tom
and
they
entered
ambrose
just
as
the
chapel
bell
was
going
down
and
he
went
to
chapel
and
then
to
hall
sitting
by
and
talking
for
companionship
while
the
rest
dined
and
so
at
last
the
time
slipped
away
and
the
captain
and
miller
mustered
them
at
the
gates
and
walked
off
to
the
boats
a
dozen
other
crews
were
making
their
way
in
the
same
direction
and
half
the
undergraduates
of
oxford
streamed
along
with
them
the
banks
of
the
river
were
crowded
and
the
punts
plied
rapidly
backwards
and
forwards
carrying
loads
of
men
over
to
the
berkshire
side
the
university
barge
and
all
the
other
barges
were
decked
with
flags
and
the
band
was
playing
lively
airs
as
the
ambrose
crew
reached
the
scene
of
action
no
time
was
lost
in
the
and
in
two
minutes
they
were
all
standing
in
flannel
trousers
and
silk
jerseys
at
the
you
had
better
keep
your
jackets
on
said
the
captain
we
be
off
yet
there
goes
they
look
like
work
do
they
the
black
and
yellow
seems
to
slip
along
so
fast
they
no
end
of
good
colors
i
wish
our
new
boat
was
black
hang
her
colors
if
she
only
stiff
in
the
back
and
dip
well
she
did
dip
yesterday
at
least
the
men
on
the
bank
said
so
there
go
baliol
and
oriel
and
university
by
jove
we
shall
be
late
where
miller
in
the
shed
getting
the
boat
out
look
here
exeter
the
talk
of
the
crew
was
silenced
for
the
moment
as
every
man
looked
eagerly
at
the
exeter
boat
the
captain
nodded
to
jervis
with
a
grim
smile
as
they
paddled
gently
by
then
the
talk
began
again
how
do
you
think
she
goes
not
so
badly
they
very
strong
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
not
a
bit
of
it
it
all
lumber
you
see
they
better
trained
than
we
are
they
look
as
fine
as
stars
so
they
ought
they
pulled
seven
miles
to
our
five
for
the
last
month
i
sure
then
we
bump
them
why
not
do
you
know
that
the
value
of
products
consist
in
the
quantity
of
labor
which
goes
to
produce
them
product
pace
over
course
from
iffley
up
labor
expended
exeter
ambrose
you
see
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
things
that
we
should
bump
them
what
moonshine
as
if
ten
miles
behind
their
stroke
are
worth
two
behind
jervis
my
dear
fellow
it
is
my
moonshine
you
must
settle
the
matter
with
the
philosophers
i
only
apply
a
universal
law
to
a
particular
case
tom
unconscious
of
the
pearls
of
economic
lore
which
were
being
poured
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
crew
was
watching
the
exeter
eight
as
it
glided
away
towards
the
cherwell
he
thought
they
seemed
to
keep
horribly
good
time
halloa
drysdale
look
there
jack
going
across
in
one
of
the
punts
of
course
it
is
you
do
suppose
he
would
go
down
to
see
the
race
why
wo
miller
let
us
start
almost
all
the
boats
are
off
there
plenty
of
time
we
may
just
as
well
be
up
here
as
dawdling
about
the
bank
at
iffley
we
go
down
till
the
last
miller
never
lets
us
get
out
down
below
well
come
here
the
boat
at
last
the
new
boat
now
emerged
from
its
shed
guided
steadily
to
where
they
were
standing
by
miller
and
the
waterman
then
the
coxswain
got
out
and
called
for
bow
who
stepped
forward
mind
how
you
step
now
there
are
no
bottom
boards
said
miller
shall
i
take
my
jacket
yes
you
had
better
all
go
down
in
jackets
in
this
wind
sent
a
man
down
to
bring
them
back
now
two
aye
aye
said
drysdale
stepping
forward
then
came
turn
and
soon
the
boat
was
manned
now
said
miller
taking
his
place
are
all
your
stretchers
right
i
should
like
a
little
more
grease
on
my
rollocks
i
taking
some
down
we
put
it
on
down
below
are
you
all
right
yes
then
push
her
off
gently
the
ambrose
boat
was
almost
the
last
so
there
were
no
punts
in
the
way
or
other
obstructions
and
they
swung
steadily
down
past
the
university
barge
the
top
of
which
was
already
covered
with
spectators
every
man
in
the
boat
felt
as
if
the
eyes
of
europe
were
on
him
and
pulled
in
his
very
best
form
small
groups
of
gownsmen
were
scattered
along
the
bank
in
christchurch
meadow
chiefly
dons
who
were
really
interested
in
the
races
but
at
that
time
of
day
seldom
liked
to
display
enthusiasm
enough
to
cross
the
water
and
go
down
to
the
these
sombre
groups
lighted
up
here
and
there
by
the
dresses
of
a
few
ladies
who
were
walking
up
and
down
and
watching
the
boats
at
the
mouth
of
the
cherwell
were
moored
two
punts
in
which
reclined
at
their
ease
some
dozen
young
gentlemen
smoking
several
of
these
were
friends
of
drysdale
and
hailed
him
as
the
boat
passed
what
a
fool
i
am
to
be
here
he
grumbled
in
an
undertone
casting
an
envious
glance
at
the
punts
in
their
comfortable
berth
up
under
the
banks
and
out
of
the
wind
i
say
brown
do
you
wish
we
were
well
past
this
on
the
way
up
silence
in
the
bows
shouted
miller
you
devil
how
i
hate
you
growled
drysdale
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
as
they
sped
along
under
the
willows
tom
got
more
comfortable
at
every
stroke
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
gut
began
to
hope
that
he
should
not
have
a
fit
or
lose
all
his
strength
just
at
the
start
or
cut
a
crab
or
come
to
some
other
unutterable
grief
the
fear
of
which
had
been
haunting
him
all
day
here
they
are
at
last
come
along
now
keep
up
with
them
said
hardy
to
grey
as
the
boat
neared
the
gut
and
the
two
trotted
along
downwards
hardy
watching
the
crew
and
grey
watching
him
hardy
how
eager
you
look
i
give
twenty
pounds
to
be
going
to
pull
in
the
race
grey
shambled
on
in
silence
by
the
side
of
his
big
friend
and
wished
he
could
understand
what
it
was
that
moved
him
so
as
the
boat
shot
into
the
gut
from
under
the
cover
of
the
oxfordshire
bank
the
wind
caught
the
bows
feather
high
now
shouted
miller
and
then
added
in
a
low
voice
to
the
captain
it
will
be
ticklish
work
starting
in
this
wind
just
as
bad
for
all
the
other
boats
answered
the
captain
well
said
old
philosopher
said
miller
it
a
comfort
to
steer
you
you
never
make
a
fellow
nervous
i
wonder
if
you
ever
felt
nervous
yourself
now
ca
say
said
the
captain
here
our
post
we
may
as
well
turn
easy
bow
side
now
two
and
four
pull
her
round
back
water
seven
and
five
shouted
the
coxswain
and
the
boat
head
swung
round
and
two
or
three
strokes
took
her
into
the
bank
jack
instantly
made
a
convulsive
attempt
to
board
but
was
sternly
repulsed
and
tumbled
backwards
into
the
water
hark
the
first
gun
the
report
sent
tom
heart
into
his
mouth
again
several
of
the
boats
pushed
off
at
once
into
the
stream
and
the
crowds
of
men
on
the
bank
began
to
be
agitated
as
it
were
by
the
shadow
of
the
coming
excitement
the
ambrose
crew
fingered
their
oars
put
a
last
dash
of
grease
on
their
rollocks
and
settled
their
feet
against
the
stretchers
shall
we
push
her
off
asked
bow
no
i
can
give
you
another
minute
said
miller
who
was
sitting
watch
in
hand
in
the
stern
only
be
smart
when
i
give
the
word
the
captain
turned
on
his
seat
and
looked
up
the
boat
his
face
was
quiet
but
full
of
confidence
which
seemed
to
pass
from
him
into
the
crew
tom
felt
calmer
and
stronger
he
met
his
eye
now
mind
boys
do
quicken
he
said
cheerily
four
short
strokes
to
get
way
on
her
and
then
steady
here
pass
up
the
lemon
and
he
took
a
sliced
lemon
out
of
his
pocket
put
a
small
piece
into
his
own
mouth
and
then
handed
it
to
blake
who
followed
his
example
and
passed
it
on
each
man
took
a
piece
and
just
as
bow
had
secured
the
end
miller
called
out
now
jackets
off
and
get
her
head
out
steadily
the
jackets
were
thrown
on
shore
and
gathered
up
by
the
boatmen
in
attendance
the
crew
poised
their
oars
no
pushing
out
her
head
and
the
captain
doing
the
same
for
the
stern
miller
took
the
in
his
hand
how
the
wind
catches
her
stern
he
said
here
pay
out
the
rope
one
of
you
no
not
you
some
fellow
with
a
strong
hand
yes
you
do
he
went
on
as
hardy
stepped
down
the
bank
and
took
hold
of
the
rope
let
me
have
it
foot
by
foot
as
i
want
it
not
too
quick
make
the
most
of
it
that
do
two
and
three
dip
your
oars
in
to
give
her
way
the
rope
paid
out
steadily
and
the
boat
settled
to
her
place
but
now
the
wind
rose
again
and
the
stern
drifted
towards
the
bank
you
back
her
a
bit
miller
and
keep
her
a
little
further
out
or
our
oars
on
stroke
side
will
catch
the
bank
so
i
see
curse
the
wind
back
her
one
stroke
all
back
her
i
say
shouted
miller
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
get
a
crew
to
back
her
an
inch
just
now
particularly
as
there
are
in
her
two
men
who
have
never
rowed
a
race
before
except
in
the
torpids
and
one
who
has
never
rowed
a
race
in
his
life
however
back
she
comes
the
slackens
in
left
hand
and
the
stroke
unshipping
his
oar
pushes
the
stern
gently
out
again
there
goes
the
second
gun
one
short
minute
more
and
we
are
off
short
minute
indeed
you
would
say
so
if
you
were
in
the
boat
with
your
heart
in
your
mouth
and
trembling
all
over
like
a
man
with
the
palsy
those
sixty
seconds
before
the
starting
gun
in
your
first
race
why
they
are
a
little
by
jove
we
are
drifting
in
again
said
miller
in
horror
the
captain
looked
grim
but
said
nothing
it
was
too
late
now
for
him
to
be
unshipping
again
here
catch
hold
of
the
long
and
fend
her
off
hardy
to
whom
this
was
addressed
seized
the
and
standing
with
one
foot
in
the
water
pressed
the
end
of
the
against
the
gunwale
at
the
full
stretch
of
his
arm
and
so
by
main
force
kept
the
stern
out
there
was
just
room
for
stroke
oars
to
dip
and
that
was
all
the
was
as
taut
as
a
will
miller
left
hand
hold
out
it
is
an
awful
moment
but
the
coxswain
though
almost
dragged
backwards
off
his
seat
is
equal
to
the
occasion
he
holds
his
watch
in
his
right
hand
with
the
tiller
rope
eight
seconds
more
only
look
out
for
the
flash
remember
all
eyes
in
the
boat
there
it
comes
at
last
the
flash
of
the
starting
gun
long
before
the
sound
of
the
report
can
roll
up
the
river
the
whole
life
and
energy
which
has
been
held
in
leash
as
it
were
for
the
last
six
minutes
is
let
loose
and
breaks
away
with
a
bound
and
a
dash
which
he
who
has
felt
it
will
remember
for
his
life
but
the
like
of
which
will
he
ever
feel
again
the
drop
from
the
coxswains
hands
the
oars
flash
into
the
water
and
gleam
on
the
feather
the
spray
flies
from
them
and
the
boats
leap
forward
the
crowds
on
the
bank
scatter
and
rush
along
each
keeping
as
near
as
it
may
be
to
its
own
boat
some
of
the
men
on
the
towing
path
some
on
the
very
edge
of
often
in
the
water
some
slightly
in
advance
as
if
they
could
help
to
drag
their
boat
forward
some
behind
where
they
can
see
the
pulling
better
but
all
at
full
speed
in
wild
excitement
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
to
those
on
whom
the
honor
of
the
college
is
laid
well
pulled
all
pick
her
up
there
five
you
gaining
every
stroke
time
in
the
bows
bravo
st
ambrose
on
they
rushed
by
the
side
of
the
boats
jostling
one
another
stumbling
struggling
and
panting
along
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
bank
the
glorious
maddening
extends
and
rolls
up
the
side
of
the
stream
for
the
first
ten
strokes
tom
was
in
too
great
fear
of
making
a
mistake
to
feel
or
hear
or
see
his
whole
soul
was
glued
to
the
back
of
the
man
before
him
his
one
thought
to
keep
time
and
get
his
strength
into
the
stroke
but
as
the
crew
settled
down
into
the
well
known
long
sweep
what
we
may
call
consciousness
returned
and
while
every
muscle
in
his
body
was
straining
and
his
chest
heaved
and
his
heart
leapt
every
nerve
seemed
to
be
gathering
new
life
and
his
senses
to
wake
into
unwonted
acuteness
he
caught
the
scent
of
the
wild
thyme
in
the
air
and
found
room
in
his
brain
to
wonder
how
it
could
have
got
there
as
he
had
never
seen
the
plant
near
the
river
or
smelt
it
before
though
his
eye
never
wandered
from
the
back
of
diogenes
he
seemed
to
see
all
things
at
once
the
boat
behind
which
seemed
to
be
gaining
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
prevent
himself
from
quickening
on
the
stroke
as
he
fancied
that
the
eager
face
of
miller
with
his
compressed
lips
and
eyes
fixed
so
earnestly
ahead
that
tom
could
almost
feel
the
glance
passing
over
his
right
shoulder
the
flying
banks
and
the
shouting
crowd
see
them
with
his
bodily
eyes
he
could
not
but
he
knew
nevertheless
that
grey
had
been
upset
and
nearly
rolled
down
the
bank
into
the
water
in
the
first
hundred
yards
that
jack
was
bounding
and
scrambling
and
barking
along
by
the
very
edge
of
the
stream
above
all
he
was
just
as
well
aware
as
if
he
had
been
looking
at
it
of
a
stalwart
form
in
cap
and
gown
bounding
along
brandishing
the
long
and
always
keeping
just
opposite
the
boat
and
amid
all
the
babel
of
voices
and
the
dash
and
pulse
of
the
stroke
and
the
laboring
of
his
own
breathing
he
heard
hardy
voice
coming
to
him
again
and
again
and
clear
as
if
there
had
been
no
other
sound
in
the
air
steady
two
steady
well
pulled
steady
steady
the
voice
seemed
to
give
him
strength
and
keep
him
to
his
work
and
what
work
it
was
he
had
had
many
a
hard
pull
in
the
last
six
weeks
but
never
aught
like
this
but
it
ca
last
for
ever
men
muscles
are
not
steel
or
their
lungs
bull
hide
and
hearts
ca
go
on
pumping
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
without
bursting
the
ambrose
boat
is
well
away
from
the
boat
behind
there
is
a
great
gap
between
the
accompanying
crowds
and
now
as
they
near
the
gut
she
hangs
for
a
moment
or
two
in
hand
though
the
roar
from
the
bank
grows
louder
and
louder
and
tom
is
already
aware
that
the
ambrose
crowd
is
melting
into
the
one
ahead
of
them
we
must
be
close
to
exeter
the
thought
flashes
into
him
and
it
would
seem
into
the
rest
of
the
crew
at
the
same
moment
for
all
at
once
the
strain
seems
taken
off
their
arms
again
there
is
no
more
drag
she
springs
to
the
stroke
as
she
did
at
the
start
and
miller
face
which
had
darkened
for
a
few
seconds
lightens
up
again
miller
face
and
attitude
are
a
study
coiled
up
into
the
smallest
possible
space
his
chin
almost
resting
on
his
knees
his
hands
close
to
his
sides
firmly
but
lightly
feeling
the
rudder
as
a
good
horseman
handles
the
mouth
of
a
hunter
if
a
coxswain
could
make
a
bump
by
his
own
exertions
surely
he
will
do
it
no
sudden
jerks
of
the
ambrose
rudder
will
you
see
watch
as
you
will
from
the
bank
the
boat
never
hangs
through
fault
of
his
but
easily
and
gracefully
rounds
every
point
you
gaining
you
gaining
he
now
and
then
mutters
to
the
captain
who
responds
with
a
wink
keeping
his
breath
for
other
matters
is
he
grand
the
captain
as
he
comes
forward
like
lightening
stroke
after
stroke
his
back
flat
his
teeth
set
his
whole
frame
working
from
the
hips
with
the
regularity
of
a
machine
as
the
space
still
narrows
the
eyes
of
the
fiery
little
coxswain
flash
with
excitement
but
he
is
far
too
good
a
judge
to
hurry
the
final
effort
before
victory
is
safe
in
his
grasp
the
two
crowds
mingle
now
and
no
mistake
and
the
shouts
come
all
in
a
heap
over
the
water
now
ambrose
six
strokes
more
now
exeter
you
gaining
pick
her
up
mind
the
gut
exeter
bravo
st
ambrose
the
water
rushes
by
still
eddying
from
the
strokes
of
the
boat
ahead
tom
fancies
now
that
he
can
hear
their
oars
and
the
working
of
their
rudder
and
the
voice
of
their
coxswain
in
another
moment
both
boats
are
in
the
gut
and
a
perfect
storm
of
shouts
reaches
them
from
the
crowd
as
it
rushes
madly
off
to
the
left
of
the
footbridge
amidst
which
oh
well
steered
well
steered
st
ambrose
is
the
prevailing
cry
then
miller
motionless
as
a
statue
till
now
lifts
his
right
hand
and
whirls
the
tassel
round
his
head
give
it
her
now
boys
six
strokes
and
we
are
into
them
old
jervis
lays
down
that
great
broad
back
and
lashes
his
oar
through
the
water
with
the
might
of
a
giant
the
crew
caught
him
up
in
another
stroke
the
tight
new
boat
answers
to
the
spurt
and
tom
feels
a
little
shock
behind
him
and
then
a
grating
sound
as
miller
shouts
unship
oars
bow
and
three
and
the
nose
of
the
ambrose
boat
glides
quietly
up
the
side
of
the
exeter
till
it
touches
their
stroke
oar
take
care
what
you
coming
to
it
is
the
coxswain
of
the
bumped
boat
who
speaks
tom
looking
round
finds
himself
within
a
foot
or
two
of
him
and
being
utterly
unable
to
contain
his
joy
and
unwilling
to
exhibit
it
before
the
eyes
of
a
gallant
rival
turns
away
towards
the
shore
and
begins
telegraphing
to
hardy
now
then
what
are
you
at
there
in
the
bows
cast
her
off
quick
come
look
alive
push
across
at
once
out
of
the
way
of
the
other
boats
i
congratulate
you
jervis
says
the
exeter
stroke
as
the
ambrose
boat
shot
past
him
do
it
again
next
race
and
i
care
we
were
within
three
lengths
of
when
we
bumped
says
the
miller
in
a
low
voice
all
right
answers
the
captain
is
so
strong
as
usual
we
have
much
trouble
there
but
a
tough
job
up
above
i
take
it
was
better
steered
than
exeter
they
muffed
it
in
the
gut
eh
said
the
captain
i
thought
so
by
the
shouts
yes
we
were
pressing
them
a
little
down
below
and
their
coxswain
kept
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
was
in
the
gut
before
he
knew
it
and
had
to
pull
his
left
hand
hard
or
they
would
have
fouled
the
oxfordshire
corner
that
stopped
their
way
and
in
we
went
bravo
and
how
well
we
started
too
yes
thanks
to
that
hardy
it
was
touch
and
go
though
i
could
have
held
that
rope
two
seconds
more
how
did
our
fellows
work
she
dragged
a
good
deal
below
the
gut
miller
looked
somewhat
serious
but
even
he
can
not
be
finding
fault
just
now
for
the
first
step
is
gained
the
first
victory
won
and
as
homer
sometimes
nods
so
miller
relaxes
the
sternness
of
his
rule
the
crew
as
soon
as
they
have
found
their
voices
again
laugh
and
talk
and
answer
the
congratulations
of
their
friends
as
the
boat
slips
along
close
to
the
towing
path
on
the
berks
side
easy
all
almost
keeping
pace
nevertheless
with
the
lower
boats
which
are
racing
up
under
the
willows
on
the
oxfordshire
side
jack
after
one
or
two
feints
makes
a
frantic
bound
into
the
water
and
is
hauled
dripping
into
the
boat
by
drysdale
unchid
by
miller
but
to
the
intense
disgust
of
diogenes
whose
pantaloons
and
principles
are
alike
outraged
by
the
proceeding
he
the
cato
of
the
oar
scorns
to
relax
the
strictness
of
his
code
even
after
victory
won
neither
word
nor
look
does
he
cast
to
the
exhulting
ambrosians
on
the
bank
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
a
subdued
chuckle
or
two
alone
betray
that
though
an
oarsman
he
is
mortal
already
he
revolves
in
his
mind
the
project
of
an
early
walk
under
a
few
not
being
quite
satisfied
conscientious
old
boy
that
he
tried
his
stretcher
enough
in
that
final
spurt
and
thinking
that
there
must
be
an
extra
pound
of
flesh
on
him
somewhere
or
other
which
did
the
mischief
i
say
brown
said
drysdale
how
do
you
feel
all
right
said
tom
i
never
felt
jollier
in
my
life
by
jove
though
it
was
an
awful
grind
did
you
wish
yourself
well
out
of
it
below
the
gut
no
nor
you
either
did
i
i
was
awfully
baked
my
throat
is
like
a
limekiln
yet
what
did
you
think
about
well
about
keeping
time
i
think
said
tom
but
i
remember
much
i
only
kept
on
by
thinking
how
i
hated
those
devils
in
the
exeter
boat
and
how
done
up
they
must
be
and
hoping
their
felt
like
having
a
fit
at
this
moment
they
came
opposite
the
cherwell
the
leading
boat
was
just
passing
the
off
the
university
barge
and
the
band
struck
up
the
conquering
hero
with
a
crash
and
while
a
mighty
sound
of
shouts
murmurs
and
music
went
up
into
the
evening
sky
miller
shook
the
again
the
captain
shouted
now
then
pick
her
up
and
the
ambrose
boat
shot
up
between
the
swarming
banks
at
racing
pace
to
her
the
lion
of
the
evening
dear
readers
of
the
gentler
sex
you
i
know
will
pardon
the
enthusiasm
which
stirs
our
pulses
now
in

we
call
up
again
the
memories
of
this
the
most
exciting
sport
of
our

we
were

in

chapter

a
change
in
the
crew
and
what
came
of
it
it
was
on
a
saturday
that
the
ambrose
boat
made
the
first
bump
described
in
our
last
chapter
on
the
next
saturday
the
after
the
first
success
at
nine
in
the
evening
our
hero
was
at
the
door
of
hardy
rooms
he
just
stopped
for
one
moment
outside
with
his
hand
on
the
lock
looking
a
little
puzzled
but
withal
pleased
and
then
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
little
estrangement
which
there
had
been
between
them
for
some
weeks
had
passed
away
since
the
races
had
begun
hardy
had
thrown
himself
into
the
spirit
of
them
so
thoroughly
that
he
had
not
only
regained
all
his
hold
on
tom
but
had
warmed
up
the
whole
crew
in
his
favour
and
had
mollified
the
martinet
miller
himself
it
was
he
who
had
managed
the
in
every
race
and
his
voice
from
the
towing
path
had
come
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
safe
guide
for
clapping
on
or
rowing
steady
even
miller
autocrat
as
he
was
had
come
to
listen
for
it
in
confirmation
of
his
own
judgment
before
calling
on
the
crew
for
the
final
effort
so
tom
had
recovered
his
old
footing
in
the
servitor
rooms
and
when
he
entered
on
the
night
in
question
did
so
with
the
bearing
of
an
intimate
friend
hardy
tea
commons
were
on
one
end
of
the
table
as
usual
and
he
was
sitting
at
the
other
poring
over
a
book
tom
marched
straight
up
to
him
and
leant
over
his
shoulder
what
here
you
are
at
the
perpetual
grind
he
said
come
shut
up
and
give
me
some
tea
i
want
to
talk
to
you
hardy
looked
up
with
a
grim
smile
are
you
up
to
a
cup
of
tea
he
said
look
here
i
was
just
reminded
of
you
fellows
shall
i
construe
for
you
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
open
page
of
the
book
he
was
reading
it
was
the
knights
of
aristophanes
and
tom
leaning
over
his
shoulder
read
greek
text
chata

malachoz
ina

tehn
en
salamint
after
meditating
a
moment
he
burst
out
you
hardhearted
old
ruffian
i
come
here
for
sympathy
and
the
first
thing
you
do
is
to
poke
fun
at
me
out
of
your
wretched
classics
i
a
good
mind
to
clear
out
and
not
to
do
my
errand
what
a
man
to
do
said
hardy
i
hold
that
it
always
better
to
laugh
at
fortune
what
the
use
of
repining
you
have
done
famously
and
second
is
a
capital
place
on
the
river
second
be
hanged
said
tom
we
mean
to
be
first
well
i
hope
we
may
said
hardy
i
can
tell
you
nobody
felt
it
more
than
i
not
even
old
diogenes
when
you
did
make
your
bump
now
you
talk
like
a
man
and
a
saint
ambrosian
said
tom
but
what
do
you
think
shall
we
ever
catch
them
and
so
saying
he
retired
to
a
chair
opposite
the
tea
things
no
said
hardy
i
do
think
we
ever
shall
i
very
sorry
to
say
it
but
they
are
an
uncommonly
strong
lot
and
we
have
a
weak
place
or
two
in
our
crew
i
do
think
we
can
do
more
than
we
did
at
least
with
the
present
crew
but
if
we
could
get
a
little
more
strength
we
might
yes
i
think
so
jervis
stroke
is
worth
two
of
theirs
a
very
little
more
powder
would
do
it
then
we
must
have
a
little
more
powder
ay
but
how
are
we
to
get
it
who
can
you
put
in
you
said
tom
sitting
up
there
now
that
just
what
i
am
come
about
drysdale
is
to
go
out
will
you
pull
next
race
they
all
want
you
to
row
do
they
said
hardy
quietly
but
tom
could
see
that
his
eye
sparkled
at
the
notion
though
he
was
too
proud
to
show
how
much
he
was
pleased
then
they
had
better
come
and
ask
me
themselves
well
you
cantankerous
old
party
they
coming
i
can
tell
you
said
tom
in
great
delight
the
captain
just
sent
me
to
break
ground
and
will
be
here
directly
himself
i
say
now
hardy
he
went
on
do
you
say
no
i
set
my
heart
upon
it
i
sure
we
shall
bump
them
if
you
pull
i
do
know
that
said
hardy
getting
up
and
beginning
to
make
tea
to
conceal
the
excitement
he
was
in
at
the
idea
of
rowing
you
see
i
not
in
training
gammon
said
tom
you
always
in
training
and
you
know
it
well
said
hardy
i
ca
be
in
worse
than
drysdale
he
has
been
of
no
use
above
the
gut
these
last
three
nights
that
just
what
miller
says
said
tom
and
here
comes
the
captain
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
while
he
spoke
and
jervis
and
miller
entered
tom
was
in
a
dreadful
fidget
for
the
next
twenty
minutes
and
may
best
be
compared
to
an
enthusiastic
envoy
negotiating
a
treaty
and
suddenly
finding
his
action
impeded
by
the
arrival
of
his
principals
miller
was
very
civil
but
not
pressing
he
seemed
to
have
come
more
with
a
view
of
talking
over
the
present
state
of
things
and
consulting
upon
them
than
to
enlisting
a
recruit
hardy
met
him
more
than
halfway
and
speculated
on
all
sorts
of
possible
issues
without
a
hint
of
volunteering
himself
but
presently
jervis
who
did
not
understand
finessing
broke
in
and
asked
hardy
point
blank
to
pull
in
the
next
race
and
when
he
pleaded
want
of
training
overruled
him
at
once
by
saying
that
there
was
no
better
training
than
sculling
so
in
half
an
hour
all
was
settled
hardy
was
to
pull
five
in
the
next
race
diogenes
was
to
take
blake
place
at
no
and
blake
to
take
drysdale
oar
at
no
the
whole
crew
were
to
go
for
a
long
training
walk
the
next
day
sunday
in
the
afternoon
to
go
down
to
abingdon
on
monday
just
to
get
into
swing
in
their
new
places
and
then
on
tuesday
to
abide
the
fate
of
war
they
had
half
an
hour
pleasant
talk
over
hardy
tea
and
then
separated
i
always
told
you
he
was
our
man
said
the
captain
to
miller
as
the
walked
together
to
the
gates
we
want
strength
and
he
is
as
strong
as
a
horse
you
must
have
seen
him
sculling
yourself
there
is
his
match
on
the
river
to
my
mind
yes
i
think
he
do
replied
miller
at
any
rate
he
ca
be
worse
than
drysdale
as
for
tom
and
hardy
it
may
safely
be
said
that
no
two
men
in
oxford
went
to
bed
in
better
spirits
that
saturday
night
than
they
two
and
now
to
explain
how
it
came
about
that
hardy
was
wanted
fortune
had
smiled
upon
the
ambrosians
in
the
two
races
which
succeeded
the
one
in
which
they
had
bumped
exeter
they
had
risen
two
more
places
without
any
very
great
trouble
of
course
the
constituencies
on
the
bank
magnified
their
powers
and
doings
there
never
was
such
a
crew
they
were
quite
safe
to
be
head
of
the
river
nothing
could
live
against
their
pace
so
the
young
oars
in
the
boat
swallowed
all
they
heard
thought
themselves
the
finest
fellows
going
took
less
and
less
pains
to
keep
up
their
condition
and
when
they
got
out
of
earshot
of
jervis
and
diogenes
were
ready
to
bet
two
to
one
that
they
would
bump
oriel
the
next
night
and
keep
easily
head
of
the
river
for
the
rest
of
the
races
saturday
night
came
and
brought
with
it
a
most
useful
though
unpalatable
lesson
to
the
ambrosians
the
oriel
boat
was
manned
chiefly
by
old
oars
seasoned
in
many
a
race
and
not
liable
to
panic
when
hard
pressed
they
had
a
fair
though
not
a
stroke
and
a
good
coxswain
experts
remarked
that
they
were
rather
too
heavy
for
their
boat
and
that
she
dipped
a
little
when
they
put
on
anything
like
a
severe
spurt
but
on
the
whole
they
were
by
no
means
the
sort
of
crew
you
could
just
run
into
hand
over
hand
so
miller
and
diogenes
preached
and
so
the
ambrosians
found
out
to
their
cost
they
had
the
pace
of
the
other
boat
and
gained
as
usual
a
length
before
the
gut
but
first
those
two
fatal
corners
were
passed
and
then
other
spots
where
former
bumps
had
been
made
and
still
miller
made
no
sign
on
the
contrary
he
looked
gloomy
and
savage
the
ambrosian
shouts
from
the
shore
too
changed
from
the
usual
exultant
peals
into
something
like
a
quaver
of
consternation
while
the
air
was
rent
with
the
name
and
laudations
of
little
oriel
long
before
the
cherwell
drysdale
was
completely
baked
he
had
played
truant
the
day
before
and
dined
at
the
weirs
were
he
had
imbibed
much
dubious
hock
but
he
from
old
habit
managed
to
keep
time
tom
and
the
other
young
oars
got
flurried
and
quickened
the
boat
dragged
there
was
no
life
left
in
her
and
though
they
managed
just
to
hold
their
first
advantage
could
not
put
her
a
foot
nearer
the
stern
of
the
oriel
boat
which
glided
past
the
a
clear
boat
length
ahead
of
her
pursuer
and
with
a
crew
much
less
depressed
such
races
must
tell
on
strokes
and
even
jervis
who
had
pulled
magnificently
throughout
was
very
much
done
at
the
close
and
leant
over
his
oar
with
a
swimming
in
his
head
and
an
approach
to
faintness
and
was
scarcely
able
to
see
for
a
minute
or
so
miller
indignation
knew
no
bounds
but
he
bottled
it
up
till
he
had
manoeuvered
the
crew
into
their
by
themselves
jervis
having
stopped
below
then
he
did
not
spare
them
they
would
kill
their
captain
whose
little
finger
was
worth
the
whole
of
them
they
were
disgracing
the
college
three
or
four
of
them
had
neither
heart
head
nor
pluck
they
all
felt
that
this
was
unjust
for
after
all
had
they
not
brought
the
boat
up
to
the
second
place
poor
diogenes
sat
in
a
corner
and
groaned
he
forgot
to
prefix
old
fellow
to
the
few
observations
he
made
blake
had
great
difficulty
in
adjusting
his
necktie
before
the
glass
he
merely
remarked
in
a
pause
of
the
objurgation
in
faith
coxswain
these
be
very
bitter
words
tom
and
most
of
the
others
were
too
much
out
of
heart
to
resist
but
at
last
drysdale
fired
up
you
no
right
to
be
so
savage
that
i
can
see
he
said
suddenly
stopping
the
low
whistle
in
which
he
was
indulging
as
he
sat
on
the
corner
of
the
table
you
seem
to
think
no
the
weakest
out
of
several
weak
places
in
the
boat
yes
i
do
said
miller
then
this
honourable
member
said
drysdale
getting
off
the
table
seeing
that
his
humble
efforts
are
unappreciated
thinks
it
best
for
the
public
service
to
place
his
resignation
in
the
hands
of
your
coxswainship
which
my
coxswainship
is
graciously
pleased
to
accept
replied
miller
hurrah
for
a
roomy
punt
and
a
soft
cushion
next
racing
night
it
almost
worth
while
to
have
been
rowing
all
this
time
to
realize
the
sensations
i
shall
feel
when
i
see
you
fellows
passing
the
cherwell
on
tuesday
it
what
i
partial
to
in
the
last
reach
from
the
towing
path
magnum
spectare
to
witness
the
tortures
of
you
wretched
beggars
in
the
boat
i
obliged
to
translate
for
drysdale
who
never
learned
latin
said
blake
finishing
his
tie
before
the
glass
there
was
an
awkward
silence
miller
was
chafing
inwardly
and
running
over
in
his
mind
what
was
to
be
done
and
nobody
else
seemed
quite
to
know
what
ought
to
happen
next
when
the
door
opened
and
jervis
came
in
congratulate
me
my
captain
said
drysdale
i
well
out
of
it
at
last
jervis
pished
and
pshaw
a
little
at
hearing
what
had
happened
but
his
presence
acted
like
oil
on
the
waters
the
moment
the
resignation
was
named
tom
thoughts
had
turned
to
hardy
now
was
the
time
he
had
such
confidence
in
the
man
that
the
idea
of
getting
him
in
for
next
race
entirely
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
to
him
and
made
him
feel
as
bumptious
again
as
he
had
done
in
the
morning
so
with
this
idea
in
his
head
he
hung
about
till
the
captain
had
made
his
toilet
and
joined
himself
to
him
and
miller
as
they
walked
up
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
said
the
captain
that
just
what
you
have
to
settle
said
miller
you
have
been
up
all
the
term
and
know
the
men
pulling
better
than
i
i
suppose
we
must
press
somebody
from
the
torpid
let
me
see
there
burton
he
rolls
like
a
porpoise
interrupted
miller
positively
impossible
stewart
might
do
then
never
kept
time
for
three
strokes
in
his
life
said
miller
well
there
are
no
better
men
said
the
captain
then
we
may
lay
our
account
to
stopping
where
we
are
if
we
do
even
lose
a
place
said
miller
dust
unto
dust
what
must
be
must
if
you
ca
get
crumb
you
best
eat
crust
said
the
captain
it
all
very
well
talking
coolly
now
said
miller
but
kill
yourself
trying
to
bump
and
there
are
three
more
nights
hardy
would
row
if
you
asked
him
i
sure
said
tom
the
captain
looked
at
miller
who
shook
his
head
i
do
think
it
he
said
i
take
him
to
be
a
shy
bird
that
wo
come
to
everybody
whistle
we
might
have
had
him
two
years
ago
i
believe
i
wish
we
had
i
always
told
you
so
said
jervis
at
any
rate
let
try
him
he
can
but
say
no
and
i
do
think
he
will
for
you
see
he
has
been
at
the
starting
place
every
night
and
as
keen
as
a
freshman
all
the
time
i
sure
he
wo
said
tom
i
know
he
would
give
anything
to
pull
you
had
better
go
to
his
rooms
and
sound
him
said
the
captain
miller
and
i
will
follow
in
half
an
hour
we
have
already
heard
how
tom
mission
prospered
the
next
day
at
a
few
moments
before
two
the
ambrose
crew
including
hardy
with
miller
who
was
a
desperate
and
indefatigable
pedestrian
for
leader
crossed
magdalen
bridge
at
five
they
returned
to
college
having
done
a
little
over
fifteen
miles
fair
heal
and
toe
walking
in
the
interval
the
afternoon
had
been
very
hot
and
miller
chuckled
to
the
captain
i
do
think
there
will
be
much
trash
left
in
any
of
them
after
that
that
fellow
hardy
is
as
fine
as
a
and
did
you
see
he
never
turned
a
hair
all
the
way
the
crew
dispersed
to
their
rooms
delighted
with
the
performance
now
that
it
was
over
and
feeling
that
they
were
much
the
better
for
it
though
they
all
declared
it
had
been
harder
work
than
any
race
they
had
yet
pulled
it
would
have
done
a
trainer
heart
good
to
have
seen
them
some
twenty
minutes
afterwards
dropping
into
hall
where
they
were
allowed
to
dine
on
sundays
on
the
joint
fresh
from
cold
baths
and
looking
ruddy
and
clear
and
hard
enough
for
anything
again
on
monday
not
a
chance
was
lost
the
ambrose
boat
started
soon
after
one
for
abingdon
they
swung
steadily
down
the
whole
way
and
back
again
to
sandford
without
a
single
spurt
miller
generally
standing
in
the
stern
and
preaching
above
all
things
steadiness
and
time
from
sandford
up
they
were
accompanied
by
half
a
dozen
men
or
so
who
ran
up
the
bank
watching
them
the
struggle
for
the
first
place
on
the
river
was
creating
great
excitement
in
the
rowing
world
and
these
were
some
of
the
most
keen
connoisseurs
who
having
heard
that
ambrose
had
changed
a
man
were
on
the
to
satisfy
themselves
as
to
how
it
would
work
the
general
opinion
was
veering
round
in
favor
of
oriel
changes
so
late
in
the
races
at
such
a
critical
moment
were
looked
upon
as
very
damaging
foremost
amongst
the
runners
on
the
bank
was
a
wiry
dark
man
with
a
sanguine
complexion
who
went
with
a
peculiar
long
low
stride
keeping
his
keen
eye
well
on
the
boat
just
above
kennington
island
jervis
noticing
this
particular
spectator
for
the
first
time
called
on
the
crew
and
quickening
his
stroke
took
them
up
the
reach
at
racing
pace
as
they
lay
in
iffley
lock
the
dark
man
appeared
above
them
and
exchanged
a
few
words
and
a
great
deal
of
dumb
show
with
the
captain
and
miller
and
then
disappeared
from
iffley
up
they
went
steadily
again
on
the
whole
miller
seemed
to
be
in
very
good
spirits
in
the
dressing
room
he
thought
the
boat
trimmed
better
and
went
better
than
she
had
ever
done
before
and
complimented
blake
particularly
for
the
ease
with
which
he
had
changed
sides
they
all
went
up
in
high
spirits
calling
on
their
way
at
the
choughs
for
one
glass
of
old
ale
round
which
miller
was
graciously
pleased
to
allow
tom
never
remembered
till
they
were
out
again
that
hardy
had
never
been
there
before
and
felt
embarrassed
for
a
moment
but
it
soon
passed
off
a
moderate
dinner
and
early
to
bed
finished
the
day
and
miller
was
justified
in
his
parting
remark
to
the
captain
well
if
we
do
win
we
can
comfort
ourselves
that
we
dropped
a
stitch
this
last
two
days
at
any
rate
then
the
eventful
day
arose
which
tom
and
many
others
felt
was
to
make
or
mar
ambrose
it
was
a
glorious
day
without
a
cloud
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
stirring
we
shall
have
a
fair
start
at
any
rate
was
the
general
feeling
we
have
already
seen
what
a
nervous
business
the
morning
of
a
is
and
must
not
go
over
the
same
ground
more
than
we
can
help
so
we
will
imagine
the
ambrose
boat
down
at
the
starting
place
lying
close
to
the
towing
path
just
before
the
first
gun
there
is
a
much
greater
crowd
than
usual
opposite
the
two
first
boats
by
this
time
most
of
the
other
boats
have
found
their
places
for
there
is
not
much
chance
of
anything
very
exciting
down
below
so
besides
the
men
of
oriel
and
ambrose
who
muster
of
all
sorts
the
fastest
of
the
fast
and
the
slowest
of
the
slow
having
been
by
this
time
shamed
into
something
like
enthusiasm
many
of
other
colleges
whose
boats
have
no
chance
of
bumping
or
being
bumped
flock
to
the
point
of
attraction
do
you
make
out
what
the
change
is
says
a
backer
of
oriel
to
his
friend
in
the
like
predicament
yes
they
got
a
do
you
see
and
by
george
i
like
his
looks
answered
his
friend
awfully
long
and
strong
in
the
arm
and
well
ribbed
up
a
devilish
awkward
customer
i
shall
go
and
try
to
get
a
hedge
pooh
says
the
other
did
you
ever
know
one
man
win
a
race
ay
that
i
have
says
his
friend
and
walks
off
toward
the
oriel
crowd
to
take
five
to
four
on
oriel
in
if
he
can
get
it
now
their
dark
friend
of
yesterday
comes
up
at
a
trot
and
pulls
up
close
to
the
captain
with
whom
he
is
evidently
dear
friends
he
is
worth
looking
at
being
coxswain
of
the
u
the
best
steerer
runner
and
swimmer
in
oxford
amphibious
himself
and
sprung
from
an
amphibious
race
his
own
boat
is
in
no
danger
so
he
has
left
her
to
take
care
of
herself
he
is
on
the
for
recruits
for
the
university
crew
and
no
recruiting
sergeant
has
a
sharper
eye
for
the
sort
of
stuff
he
requires
what
his
name
he
says
in
a
low
tone
to
jervis
giving
a
jerk
with
his
head
towards
hardy
where
did
you
get
him
hardy
answers
the
captain
in
the
same
tone
it
his
first
night
in
the
boat
i
know
that
replies
the
coxswain
i
never
saw
him
row
before
yesterday
he
the
fellow
who
sculls
in
that
brown
skiff
he
yes
and
i
think
he
do
keep
your
eye
on
him
the
coxswain
nods
as
if
he
were
somewhat
of
the
same
mind
and
examines
hardy
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
pretty
much
as
the
judge
at
an
agricultural
show
looks
at
the
prize
bull
hardy
is
tightening
the
strop
of
his
stretcher
and
of
the
compliments
which
are
being
paid
him
the
great
authority
seems
satisfied
with
his
inspection
grins
rubs
his
hands
and
trots
off
to
the
oriel
boat
to
make
comparisons
just
as
the
first
gun
is
heard
grey
sidles
nervously
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
as
if
he
were
doing
something
very
audacious
and
draws
hardy
attention
exchanging
sympathizing
nods
with
him
but
saying
nothing
for
he
knows
not
what
to
say
and
then
disappearing
again
in
the
crowd
hallo
drysdale
is
that
you
says
blake
as
they
push
off
from
the
shore
i
thought
you
were
going
to
take
it
easy
in
a
punt
so
i
thought
says
drysdale
but
i
could
keep
away
and
here
i
am
i
shall
run
up
and
mind
if
i
see
you
within
ten
feet
and
to
win
i
give
a
view
holloa
i
be
bound
you
shall
hear
it
may
it
come
speedily
said
blake
and
then
settled
himself
in
his
seat
eyes
in
the
boat
mind
now
steady
all
watch
the
stroke
and
do
quicken
these
are
miller
last
words
every
faculty
of
himself
and
the
crew
being
now
devoted
to
getting
a
good
start
this
is
no
difficult
matter
as
the
water
is
like
glass
and
the
boat
lies
lightly
on
it
obeying
the
slightest
dip
of
the
oars
of
bow
and
two
who
just
feel
the
water
twice
or
thrice
in
the
last
minute
then
after
a
few
moments
of
breathless
hush
on
the
bank
the
last
gun
is
fired
and
they
are
off
the
same
scene
of
mad
excitement
ensues
only
tenfold
more
intense
as
almost
the
whole
interest
of
the
races
is
tonight
concentrated
on
the
two
head
boats
and
their
fate
at
every
gate
there
is
a
jam
and
the
weaker
vessels
are
shoved
into
the
ditches
upset
and
left
unnoticed
the
most
active
men
including
the
u
coxswain
shun
the
gates
altogether
and
take
the
big
ditches
in
their
stride
making
for
the
long
bridges
that
they
may
get
quietly
over
these
and
be
safe
for
the
best
part
of
the
race
they
know
that
the
critical
point
of
the
struggle
will
be
near
the
finish
both
boats
made
a
beautiful
start
and
again
as
before
in
the
first
dash
the
ambrose
pace
tells
and
they
gain
their
length
before
first
winds
fail
then
they
settle
down
for
a
long
steady
effort
both
crews
are
rowing
comparatively
steady
reserving
themselves
for
the
tug
of
war
up
above
thus
they
pass
the
gut
and
those
two
treacherous
corners
the
scene
of
countless
bumps
into
the
wider
water
beyond
up
under
the
willows
miller
face
is
decidedly
hopeful
he
shows
no
sign
indeed
but
you
can
see
that
he
is
not
the
same
man
as
he
was
at
this
place
in
the
last
race
he
feels
that
the
boat
is
full
of
life
and
that
he
can
call
on
his
crew
with
hopes
of
an
answer
his
eye
also
detects
that
while
both
crews
are
at
full
stretch
his
own
instead
of
losing
as
it
did
on
the
last
night
is
now
gaining
inch
by
inch
on
oriel
the
gain
is
scarcely
perceptible
to
him
even
from
the
bank
it
is
quite
imperceptible
but
there
it
is
he
is
surer
and
surer
of
it
as
one
after
another
the
willows
are
left
behind
and
now
comes
the
pinch
the
oriel
captain
is
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
the
fact
which
has
been
dawning
on
miller
but
will
not
acknowledge
it
to
himself
and
as
his
coxswain
turns
the
boat
head
gently
across
the
stream
and
makes
for
the
berkshire
side
and
the
goal
now
full
in
view
he
smiles
grimly
as
he
quickens
his
stroke
he
will
shake
off
these
light
heeled
gentry
yet
as
he
did
before
miller
sees
the
move
in
a
moment
and
signals
his
captain
and
the
next
stroke
ambrose
has
quickened
also
and
now
there
is
no
mistake
about
it
ambrose
is
creeping
up
slowly
but
surely
the
boat
length
lessens
to
forty
feet
thirty
feet
surely
and
steadily
lessens
but
the
race
is
not
lost
yet
thirty
feet
is
a
short
space
enough
to
look
at
on
the
water
but
a
good
bit
to
pick
up
foot
by
foot
in
the
last
two
or
three
hundred
yards
of
a
desperate
struggle
they
are
over
under
the
berkshire
side
now
and
there
stands
up
the
close
ahead
all
but
won
the
distance
lessens
and
lessens
still
but
the
oriel
crew
stick
steadily
and
gallantly
to
their
work
and
will
fight
every
inch
of
distance
to
the
last
the
oriel
men
on
the
bank
who
are
rushing
along
sometimes
in
the
water
sometimes
out
hoarse
furious
madly
alternating
between
hope
and
despair
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
a
man
in
the
crew
off
the
mouth
of
the
cherwell
there
is
still
twenty
feet
between
them
another
minute
and
it
will
be
over
one
way
or
another
every
man
in
both
crews
is
now
doing
his
best
and
no
mistake
tell
me
which
boat
holds
the
most
men
who
can
do
better
than
their
best
at
a
pinch
who
will
risk
a
broken
and
i
will
tell
you
how
it
will
end
hard
pounding
gentlemen
let
see
who
will
pound
longest
the
duke
is
reported
to
have
said
at
waterloo
and
won
now
tommy
lad
is
thou
or
i
big
ben
said
as
he
came
up
to
the
last
round
of
his
hardest
fight
and
won
is
there
a
man
of
that
temper
in
either
crew
tonight
if
so
now
his
time
for
both
coxswains
have
called
on
their
men
for
the
last
effort
miller
is
whirling
the
tassel
of
his
tiller
rope
round
his
head
like
a
wiry
little
lunatic
from
the
towing
path
from
christchurch
meadow
from
the
row
of
punts
from
the
clustered
tops
of
the
barges
comes
a
roar
of
encouragement
and
applause
and
the
band
unable
to
resist
the
impulse
breaks
with
a
crash
into
the
jolly
young
watermen
playing
two
bars
to
the
second
a
bump
in
the
gut
is
nothing
a
few
partisans
on
the
to
cheer
you
already
out
of
breath
but
up
here
at
the
very
finish
with
all
oxford
looking
on
when
the
prize
is
the
headship
of
the
river
once
in
a
generation
only
do
men
get
such
a
chance
who
ever
saw
jervis
not
up
to
his
work
the
ambrose
stroke
is
glorious
tom
had
an
atom
of
go
still
left
in
the
very
back
of
his
head
and
at
this
moment
he
heard
drysdale
view
holloa
above
all
the
din
it
seemed
to
give
him
a
lift
and
other
men
besides
in
the
boat
for
in
another
six
strokes
the
gap
is
lessened
and
ambrose
has
crept
up
to
ten
feet
and
now
to
five
from
the
stern
of
oriel
weeks
afterwards
hardy
confided
to
tom
that
when
he
heard
that
view
holloa
he
seemed
to
feel
the
muscles
of
his
arms
and
legs
turn
into
steel
and
did
more
work
in
the
last
twenty
strokes
than
in
any
other
forty
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
race
another
fifty
yards
and
oriel
is
safe
but
the
look
on
the
captain
face
is
so
ominous
that
their
coxswain
glances
over
his
shoulder
the
bow
of
ambrose
is
within
two
feet
of
their
rudder
it
is
a
moment
for
desperate
expedients
he
pulls
his
left
tiller
rope
suddenly
thereby
carrying
the
stern
of
his
own
boat
out
of
the
line
of
the
ambrose
and
calls
on
his
crew
once
more
they
respond
gallantly
yet
but
the
rudder
is
against
them
for
a
moment
and
the
boat
drags
ambrose
overlaps
a
bump
a
bump
shout
the
ambrosians
on
shore
row
on
row
on
screams
miller
he
has
not
yet
felt
the
electric
shock
and
knows
he
will
miss
his
bump
if
the
young
ones
slacken
for
a
moment
a
young
coxswain
would
have
gone
on
making
shots
at
the
stern
of
the
oriel
boat
and
so
have
lost
a
bump
now
and
no
mistake
the
bow
of
the
ambrose
boat
jams
the
oar
of
the
oriel
stroke
and
the
two
boats
pass
the
with
the
way
that
was
on
them
when
the
bump
was
made
so
near
a
shave
was
it
who
can
describe
the
scene
on
the
bank
it
was
a
of
delirious
joy
in
the
midst
of
which
took
place
a
terrific
combat
between
jack
and
the
oriel
dog
a
noble
black
bull
terrier
belonging
to
the
college
in
general
and
no
one
in
particular
who
always
attended
the
races
and
felt
the
misfortune
keenly
luckily
they
were
parted
without
worse
things
happening
for
though
the
oriel
men
were
savage
and
not
disinclined
for
a
jostle
the
milk
of
human
kindness
was
too
strong
for
the
moment
in
their
adversaries
so
jack
was
choked
off
with
some
trouble
and
the
oriel
men
extricated
themselves
from
the
crowd
carrying
off
crib
their
dog
and
looking
straight
before
them
into
vacancy
well
rowed
boys
says
jervis
turning
round
to
his
crew
as
they
lay
panting
on
their
oars
well
rowed
five
says
miller
who
even
in
the
hour
of
such
a
triumph
is
not
inclined
to
be
general
in
laudation
well
rowed
five
is
echoed
from
the
bank
it
is
that
cunning
man
the
well
rowed
he
adds
to
a
comrade
with
whom
he
gets
into
one
of
the
punts
to
cross
to
christchurch
meadow
we
must
have
him
in
the
university
crew
i
do
think
you
get
him
to
row
from
what
i
hear
answers
the
other
then
he
must
he
handcuffed
and
carried
into
the
boat
by
force
says
the
u
coxswain
why
is
not
the
pressgang
an
institution
in
this
university
chapter
xv
a
storm
brews
and
breaks
certainly
drysdale
character
came
out
well
that
night
he
did
not
seem
the
least
jealous
of
the
success
which
had
been
achieved
through
his
dismissal
on
the
contrary
there
was
no
man
in
the
college
who
showed
more
interest
in
the
race
or
joy
at
the
result
then
he
perhaps
the
pleasure
of
being
out
of
it
himself
may
have
reckoned
for
something
with
him
in
any
case
there
he
was
at
the
door
with
jack
to
meet
the
crew
as
they
landed
after
the
race
with
a
large
pewter
foaming
with
shandygaff
in
each
hand
for
their
recreation
draco
himself
could
not
have
forbidden
them
to
drink
at
that
moment
so
amidst
shaking
of
hands
and
clapping
on
the
back
the
pewters
travelled
round
from
stroke
to
bow
and
then
the
crew
went
off
to
their
accompanied
by
drysdale
and
others
bravo
it
was
the
finest
race
that
has
been
seen
on
the
river
this
six
years
everybody
says
so
you
fellows
have
deserved
well
of
your
country
i
sent
up
to
college
to
have
supper
in
my
room
and
you
must
all
come
hang
training
there
are
only
two
more
nights
and
you
safe
to
keep
your
place
what
do
you
say
captain
eh
miller
now
be
for
once
well
we
do
get
head
of
the
river
every
night
said
miller
i
do
object
if
you
all
turn
out
and
go
to
bed
at
eleven
that
all
right
said
drysdale
and
now
let
go
to
the
old
and
have
a
glass
of
ale
while
supper
is
getting
ready
eh
brown
and
he
hooked
his
arm
into
tom
and
led
the
way
into
the
town
i
so
sorry
you
were
not
in
it
for
the
finish
said
tom
who
was
quite
touched
by
his
friend
are
you
said
drysdale
it
more
than
i
am
then
i
can
tell
you
if
you
could
have
seen
yourself
under
the
willows
you
would
have
thought
yourself
much
of
an
object
of
envy
jack
and
i
were
quite
satisfied
with
our
share
of
work
and
glory
on
the
bank
were
we
old
fellow
at
which
salutation
jack
reared
himself
on
his
hind
legs
and
licked
his
master
hand
well
you
a
real
good
fellow
for
taking
it
as
you
do
i
think
i
could
have
come
near
the
river
if
i
had
been
you
i
take
everything
as
it
comes
said
drysdale
the
next
race
is
on
derby
day
and
i
could
have
gone
if
i
had
been
turned
out
of
the
boat
that
a
compensation
you
see
here
we
are
i
wonder
if
miss
patty
has
heard
of
the
victory
they
turned
down
the
little
passage
entrance
of
the
choughs
as
he
spoke
followed
by
most
of
the
crew
and
by
a
tail
of
younger
ambrosians
their
admirers
and
the
bar
was
crowded
the
next
moment
patty
was
there
of
course
and
her
services
were
in
great
requisition
for
though
each
of
the
crew
only
took
a
small
glass
of
the
old
ale
they
made
as
much
fuss
about
it
with
the
pretty
barmaid
as
if
they
were
drinking
hogsheads
in
fact
it
had
become
clearly
the
correct
thing
with
the
ambrosians
to
make
much
of
patty
and
considering
the
circumstances
it
was
only
a
wonder
that
she
was
not
more
spoiled
than
seemed
to
be
the
case
indeed
as
hardy
stood
up
in
the
corner
opposite
to
the
landlady
chair
a
silent
onlooker
at
the
scene
he
help
admitting
to
himself
that
the
girl
held
her
own
well
without
doing
or
saying
anything
unbecoming
a
modest
woman
and
it
was
a
hard
thing
for
him
to
be
fair
to
her
for
what
he
saw
now
in
a
few
minutes
confirmed
the
impression
which
his
former
visit
had
left
on
his
mind
that
his
friend
was
safe
in
her
toils
how
deeply
of
course
he
could
not
judge
but
that
there
was
more
between
them
than
he
could
approve
was
now
clear
enough
to
him
and
he
stood
silent
leaning
against
the
wall
in
that
farthest
corner
in
the
shadow
of
a
projecting
cupboard
much
distressed
in
mind
and
pondering
over
what
it
behove
him
to
do
under
the
circumstances
with
the
exception
of
a
civil
sentence
or
two
to
the
old
landlady
who
sat
opposite
him
knitting
and
casting
rather
uneasy
looks
from
time
to
time
towards
the
front
of
the
bar
he
spoke
to
no
one
in
fact
nobody
came
near
that
end
of
the
room
and
their
existence
seemed
to
have
been
forgotten
by
the
rest
tom
had
been
a
little
uncomfortable
for
the
first
minute
but
after
seeing
hardy
take
his
glass
of
ale
and
then
missing
him
he
forgot
all
about
him
and
was
too
busy
with
his
own
affairs
to
trouble
himself
further
he
had
become
a
sort
of
drawer
or
barman
at
the
cloughs
and
presided
under
patty
over
the
distribution
of
the
ale
giving
an
eye
to
his
chief
to
see
that
she
was
not
put
upon
drysdale
and
jack
left
after
a
short
stay
to
see
that
the
supper
was
being
properly
prepared
soon
afterwards
patty
went
off
out
of
the
bar
in
answer
to
some
bell
which
called
her
to
another
part
of
the
house
and
the
ambrosians
voted
that
it
was
time
to
go
off
to
college
to
supper
and
cleared
out
into
the
street
tom
went
out
with
the
last
batch
of
them
but
lingered
a
moment
in
the
passage
outside
he
knew
the
house
and
its
ways
well
enough
by
this
time
the
next
moment
patty
appeared
from
a
side
door
which
led
to
another
part
of
the
house
so
you
not
going
to
stay
and
play
a
game
with
aunt
she
said
what
makes
you
in
such
a
hurry
i
must
go
up
to
college
there
a
supper
to
celebrate
our
getting
head
of
the
river
patty
looked
down
and
pouted
a
little
tom
took
her
hand
and
said
sentimentally
do
be
cross
now
you
know
that
i
would
sooner
stay
here
do
you
she
tossed
her
head
and
pulled
away
her
hand
and
then
changing
the
subject
said
who
that
ugly
old
fellow
who
was
here
again
there
was
no
one
older
than
miller
and
he
is
rather
an
admirer
of
yours
i
shall
tell
him
you
called
him
ugly
oh
i
do
mean
miller
you
know
that
well
enough
she
answered
i
mean
him
in
the
old
rough
coat
who
do
talk
to
anyone
ugly
old
fellow
patty
why
you
mean
hardy
he
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
you
must
like
him
for
my
sake
i
sure
i
wo
i
do
like
him
a
bit
he
looks
so
cross
at
me
it
all
your
fancy
there
now
you
sha
go
however
till
you
given
me
that
handkerchief
you
promised
it
me
if
you
got
head
of
the
river
oh
you
little
why
they
are
my
college
colors
i
would
part
with
them
for
worlds
i
give
you
a
lock
of
my
hair
and
the
prettiest
handkerchief
you
can
find
in
oxford
but
not
this
but
i
have
it
and
you
promise
me
it
she
said
and
put
up
her
hands
suddenly
and
untied
the
bow
of
he
caught
her
wrists
in
his
hands
and
looked
down
into
her
eyes
in
which
if
he
saw
a
little
pique
at
his
going
he
saw
other
things
which
stirred
in
him
strange
feelings
of
triumph
and
tenderness
well
then
you
shall
pay
for
it
anyhow
he
why
need
i
tell
what
followed
there
was
a
little
struggle
a
go
along
do
brown
and
the
next
minute
tom
minus
his
handkerchief
was
hurrying
after
his
companions
and
patty
was
watching
him
from
the
door
and
setting
her
cap
to
rights
then
she
turned
and
went
back
into
the
bar
and
started
and
turned
red
as
she
saw
hardy
there
still
standing
in
the
further
corner
opposite
her
aunt
he
finished
his
glass
of
ale
as
she
came
in
and
then
passed
out
wishing
them
why
aunt
she
said
i
thought
they
were
all
gone
who
was
that
man
he
seems
a
nice
quiet
gentleman
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
looking
up
i
sure
he
much
better
than
those
ones
as
make
so
much
racket
in
the
bar
but
where
have
you
been
patty
oh
to
the
commercial
room
aunt
wo
you
have
a
game
at
cribbage
and
patty
took
up
the
cards
and
set
the
board
out
the
old
lady
looking
at
her
doubtfully
all
the
time
through
her
spectacles
she
was
beginning
to
wish
that
the
college
gentlemen
would
come
so
much
to
the
house
though
they
were
very
good
customers
tom
minus
his
handkerchief
hurried
after
his
comrades
and
caught
them
up
before
they
got
to
college
they
were
all
there
but
hardy
whose
absence
vexed
our
hero
for
a
moment
he
had
hoped
that
hardy
now
that
he
was
in
the
boat
would
have
shaken
off
all
his
reserve
towards
the
other
men
and
blamed
him
because
he
had
not
done
so
at
once
there
could
be
no
reason
for
it
but
his
own
oddness
he
thought
for
everyone
was
full
of
his
praises
as
they
strolled
on
talking
of
the
race
miller
praised
his
style
and
time
and
pluck
did
you
feel
how
the
boat
sprung
when
i
called
on
you
at
the
cherwell
he
said
to
the
captain
drysdale
was
always
dead
beat
at
the
gut
and
just
like
a
log
in
the
boat
pretty
much
like
some
of
the
rest
of
you
he
in
such
good
training
too
said
diogenes
i
shall
find
out
how
he
diets
himself
we
pretty
well
done
with
that
i
should
hope
said
there
are
only
two
more
nights
and
nothing
can
touch
us
now
do
be
too
sure
of
that
said
miller
mind
now
all
of
you
do
let
us
have
any
nonsense
till
the
races
are
over
and
we
are
all
safe
and
so
they
talked
on
till
they
reached
college
and
then
dispersed
to
their
rooms
to
wash
and
dress
and
met
again
in
drysdale
rooms
where
supper
was
awaiting
them
again
hardy
did
not
appear
drysdale
sent
a
scout
to
his
rooms
who
brought
back
word
that
he
could
not
find
him
so
drysdale
set
to
work
to
do
the
honors
of
his
table
and
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
tempting
the
crew
with
all
sorts
of
forbidden
hot
liquors
which
he
and
the
rest
of
the
non
professionals
imbibed
freely
but
with
miller
eye
on
them
and
the
example
of
diogenes
and
the
captain
before
them
the
rest
of
the
crew
exercised
an
abstemiousness
which
would
have
been
admirable
had
it
not
been
in
a
great
measure
compulsory
it
was
a
great
success
this
supper
at
drysdale
although
knocked
up
at
an
hour
notice
the
triumph
of
their
boat
had
for
the
time
the
effect
of
warming
up
and
drawing
out
the
feeling
of
fellowship
which
is
the
soul
of
college
life
though
only
a
few
men
besides
the
crew
sat
down
to
supper
long
before
it
was
cleared
away
men
of
every
set
in
the
college
came
in
in
the
highest
spirits
and
the
room
was
crowded
for
drysdale
sent
round
to
every
man
in
the
college
with
whom
he
had
a
speaking
acquaintance
and
they
flocked
in
and
sat
where
they
could
and
men
talked
and
laughed
with
neighbors
with
whom
perhaps
they
had
never
exchanged
a
word
since
the
time
when
they
were
freshmen
together
of
course
there
were
speeches
cheered
to
the
echo
and
songs
of
which
the
choruses
might
have
been
heard
in
the
at
a
little
before
eleven
nevertheless
despite
the
protestations
of
drysdale
and
the
passive
resistance
of
several
of
their
number
miller
carried
off
the
crew
and
many
of
the
other
guests
went
at
the
same
time
leaving
their
host
and
a
small
circle
to
make
a
night
of
it
tom
went
to
his
room
in
high
spirits
humming
the
air
of
one
of
the
songs
he
had
just
heard
but
he
had
scarcely
thrown
his
gown
on
a
chair
when
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
ran
down
stairs
again
and
across
to
hardy
rooms
hardy
was
sitting
with
some
cold
tea
poured
out
but
untasted
before
him
and
no
books
open
a
very
unusual
thing
with
him
at
night
but
tom
either
did
not
or
would
not
notice
that
there
was
anything
unusual
he
seated
himself
and
began
gossiping
away
as
fast
as
he
could
without
looking
much
at
the
other
he
began
by
recounting
all
the
complimentary
things
which
had
been
said
by
miller
and
others
of
hardy
pulling
then
he
went
on
to
the
supper
party
what
a
jolly
evening
they
had
had
he
did
not
remember
anything
so
pleasant
since
he
had
been
up
and
he
retailed
the
speeches
and
named
the
best
songs
you
really
ought
to
have
been
there
why
did
you
come
drysdale
sent
over
for
you
i
sure
every
one
wished
you
had
been
there
did
you
get
his
message
i
did
feel
up
to
going
said
hardy
there
nothing
the
matter
eh
said
tom
as
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
perhaps
hardy
had
hurt
himself
in
the
race
as
he
had
not
been
regularly
training
no
nothing
answered
the
other
tom
tried
to
make
play
again
but
soon
came
to
an
end
of
his
talk
it
was
impossible
to
make
head
against
that
cold
silence
at
last
he
stopped
looked
at
hardy
for
a
minute
who
was
staring
abstractedly
at
the
sword
over
his
and
then
said
there
something
the
matter
though
do
sit
glowering
as
if
you
had
swallowed
a
furze
bush
why
you
have
been
smoking
old
boy
he
added
getting
up
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
others
shoulder
i
see
that
it
here
take
one
of
my
weeds
mild
miller
allows
two
of
these
a
day
no
said
hardy
rousing
himself
miller
interfered
with
my
smoking
and
i
have
a
pipe
for
i
think
i
want
it
well
i
do
see
that
it
does
you
any
good
said
tom
after
watching
him
fill
and
light
and
smoke
for
some
minutes
without
saying
a
word
here
i
managed
the
one
thing
i
had
at
heart
you
are
in
the
crew
and
we
are
head
of
the
river
and
everybody
is
praising
your
rowing
up
to
the
skies
and
saying
that
the
bump
was
all
your
doing
and
here
i
come
to
tell
you
and
not
a
word
can
i
get
out
of
you
ai
you
pleased
do
you
think
we
shall
keep
our
place
he
paused
a
moment
hang
it
all
i
say
he
added
losing
all
patience
swear
a
little
if
you
ca
do
anything
else
let
hear
your
voice
it
is
such
a
tender
one
that
you
need
keep
it
all
shut
up
well
said
hardy
making
a
great
effort
the
real
fact
is
i
something
and
something
very
serious
to
say
to
you
then
i
not
going
to
listen
to
it
broke
in
tom
i
not
serious
and
i
wo
be
serious
and
no
one
shall
make
me
serious
it
no
use
so
do
look
glum
but
is
the
ale
at
choughs
good
and
is
it
a
dear
little
place
it
that
place
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
said
hardy
turning
his
chair
suddenly
so
as
to
front
his
visitor
now
brown
we
have
known
one
another
long
but
i
think
i
understand
you
and
i
know
i
like
you
and
i
hope
you
like
me
well
well
well
broke
in
tom
of
course
i
like
you
old
fellow
or
else
i
should
come
poking
after
you
and
wasting
so
much
of
your
time
and
sitting
on
your
cursed
hard
chairs
in
the
middle
of
the
races
what
has
liking
to
do
with
choughs
or
choughs
with
long
faces
you
ought
to
have
had
another
glass
of
ale
there
i
wish
you
had
never
had
a
glass
of
ale
there
said
hardy
bolting
out
his
words
as
if
they
were
red
hot
brown
you
have
no
right
to
go
to
that
place
why
said
tom
sitting
up
in
his
chair
and
beginning
to
be
nettled
you
know
why
said
hardy
looking
him
full
in
the
face
and
puffing
out
huge
volumes
of
smoke
in
spite
of
the
bluntness
of
the
attack
there
was
a
yearning
look
which
spread
over
the
rugged
brow
and
shone
out
of
the
deep
set
eyes
of
the
speaker
which
almost
conquered
tom
but
first
pride
and
then
the
consciousness
of
what
was
coming
next
which
began
to
dawn
on
him
rose
in
his
heart
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
meet
that
look
full
but
he
managed
it
though
he
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
as
he
simply
repeated
through
his
set
teeth
why
i
say
again
said
hardy
you
know
why
i
see
what
you
mean
said
tom
slowly
as
you
say
we
have
not
known
one
another
long
long
enough
though
i
should
have
thought
for
you
to
have
been
more
charitable
why
am
i
not
to
go
to
cloughs
because
there
happens
to
be
a
pretty
bar
maid
there
all
our
crew
go
and
twenty
other
men
besides
yes
but
do
any
of
them
go
in
the
sort
of
way
you
do
does
she
look
at
anyone
of
them
as
she
does
at
you
how
do
i
know
that
not
fair
or
true
or
like
you
brown
said
hardy
getting
up
and
beginning
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
you
know
that
that
girl
does
care
a
straw
for
the
other
men
who
go
there
you
know
that
she
is
beginning
to
care
for
you
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
it
said
tom
i
believe
you
were
ever
there
before
two
days
ago
no
i
never
was
then
i
think
you
need
be
quite
so
quick
at
finding
fault
if
there
were
anything
i
did
wish
you
to
see
do
you
think
i
should
have
taken
you
there
i
tell
you
she
is
quite
able
to
take
care
of
herself
so
i
believe
said
hardy
if
she
were
a
mere
giddy
light
girl
setting
her
cap
at
every
man
who
came
in
it
matter
so
much
for
her
at
any
rate
she
can
take
care
of
herself
well
enough
so
far
as
the
rest
are
concerned
but
you
know
it
is
so
with
you
you
know
it
now
brown
tell
the
truth
anyone
with
half
an
eye
can
see
it
you
seem
to
have
made
pretty
good
use
of
your
eyes
in
these
two
nights
anyhow
said
tom
i
do
mind
your
sneers
brown
said
hardy
as
he
tramped
up
and
down
with
his
arms
locked
behind
him
i
have
taken
on
myself
to
speak
to
you
about
this
i
should
be
no
true
friend
if
i
shirked
it
i
four
years
older
than
you
and
have
seen
more
of
the
world
and
of
this
place
than
you
you
go
on
with
this
folly
this
sin
for
want
of
warning
so
it
seems
said
tom
doggedly
now
i
think
i
had
warning
enough
suppose
we
drop
the
subject
hardy
stopped
his
walk
and
turned
on
tom
with
a
look
of
anger
not
yet
he
said
firmly
you
know
best
how
and
why
you
have
done
it
but
you
know
that
somehow
or
other
you
have
made
that
girl
like
you
suppose
i
have
what
then
whose
business
is
that
but
mine
and
hers
it
the
business
of
everyone
who
wo
stand
by
and
see
the
devil
game
played
under
his
nose
if
he
can
hinder
it
what
right
have
you
to
talk
about
the
devil
game
to
me
said
tom
i
tell
you
what
if
you
and
i
are
to
keep
friends
we
had
better
drop
this
subject
if
we
are
to
keep
friends
we
must
go
to
the
bottom
of
it
there
are
only
two
endings
to
this
sort
of
business
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
a
right
and
wrong
one
eh
and
because
you
call
me
your
friend
you
assume
that
my
end
will
be
the
wrong
one
i
do
call
you
my
friend
and
i
say
the
end
must
be
the
wrong
one
here
there
no
right
end
think
of
your
family
you
do
mean
to
say
you
dare
not
tell
me
that
you
will
marry
her
i
not
tell
you
said
tom
starting
up
in
his
turn
i
dare
tell
you
or
any
man
anything
i
please
but
i
wo
tell
you
or
any
man
anything
on
compulsion
i
repeat
went
on
hardy
you
not
say
you
mean
to
marry
her
you
do
mean
it
and
as
you
do
to
kiss
her
as
you
did
so
you
were
sneaking
behind
to
watch
me
burst
out
tom
chafing
with
rage
and
glad
to
find
any
handle
for
a
quarrel
the
two
men
stood
fronting
one
another
the
younger
writhing
with
the
sense
of
shame
and
outraged
pride
and
longing
for
a
fierce
answer
a
blow
anything
to
give
vent
to
the
furies
which
were
tearing
him
but
at
the
end
of
a
few
seconds
the
elder
answered
calmly
and
slowly
i
will
not
take
those
words
from
any
man
you
had
better
leave
my
rooms
if
i
do
i
shall
not
come
back
till
you
have
altered
your
opinions
you
need
not
come
back
till
you
have
altered
yours
the
next
moment
tom
was
in
the
passage
the
next
striding
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
inner
quadrangle
in
the
pale
moonlight
poor
fellow
it
was
no
pleasant
walking
ground
for
him
is
it
worth
our
while
to
follow
him
up
and
down
in
his
tramp
we
have
most
of
us
walked
the
like
marches
at
one
time
or
another
of
our
lives
the
memory
of
them
is
by
no
means
one
which
we
can
dwell
on
with
pleasure
times
they
were
of
blinding
and
driving
storm
and
howling
winds
out
of
which
voices
as
of
evil
spirits
spoke
close
in
our
ears
tauntingly
temptingly
whispering
to
the
mischievous
wild
beast
which
lurks
in
the
bottom
of
all
our
hearts
now
rouse
up
art
thou
a
man
and
darest
not
do
this
thing
now
rise
kill
and
eat
it
is
thine
wilt
thou
not
take
it
shall
the
flimsy
scruples
of
this
teacher
or
the
sanctified
cant
of
that
bar
thy
way
and
balk
thee
of
thine
own
thou
hast
strength
to
brave
them
to
brave
all
things
in
earth
or
heaven
or
hell
put
out
thy
strength
and
be
a
man
then
did
not
the
wild
beast
within
us
shake
itself
and
feel
its
power
sweeping
away
all
the
thou
shalt
not
which
the
law
wrote
up
before
us
in
letters
of
fire
with
the
of
hardy
godless
and
all
the
while
which
alone
made
the
storm
really
dreadful
to
us
was
there
not
the
still
small
voice
never
to
be
altogether
silenced
by
the
roarings
of
the
tempest
of
passion
by
the
evil
voices
by
our
own
violent
attempts
to
stifle
it
the
still
small
voice
appealing
to
the
man
the
true
man
within
us
which
is
made
in
the
image
of
god
calling
on
him
to
assert
his
dominion
over
the
wild
beast
to
obey
and
conquer
and
live
ay
and
though
we
may
have
followed
the
other
voices
have
we
not
while
following
them
confessed
in
our
hearts
that
all
true
strength
and
nobleness
and
manliness
was
to
be
found
in
the
other
path
do
i
say
that
most
of
us
have
had
to
tread
this
path
and
fight
this
battle
surely
i
might
have
said
all
of
us
all
at
least
who
have
passed
the
bright
days
of
their
boyhood
the
clear
and
keen
intellect
no
less
than
the
dull
and
heavy
the
weak
the
cold
the
nervous
no
less
than
the
strong
and
passionate
of
body
the
arms
and
the
field
have
been
divers
can
have
been
the
same
i
suppose
to
no
two
men
but
the
battle
must
have
been
the
same
to
all
one
here
and
there
may
have
had
a
foretaste
of
it
as
a
boy
but
it
is
the
young
man
battle
and
not
the
boy
thank
god
for
it
that
most
hateful
and
fearful
of
all
realities
call
it
by
what
name
we
will
self
the
natural
man
the
old
adam
must
have
risen
up
before
each
of
us
in
early
manhood
if
not
sooner
challenging
the
true
man
within
us
to
which
the
spirit
of
god
is
speaking
to
a
struggle
for
life
or
death
gird
yourself
then
for
the
fight
my
young
brother
and
take
up
the
pledge
which
was
made
for
you
when
you
were
a
helpless
child
this
world
and
all
others
time
and
eternity
for
you
hang
upon
the
issue
this
enemy
must
be
met
and
vanquished
not
finally
for
no
man
while
on
earth
i
suppose
can
say
that
he
is
slain
but
when
once
known
and
recognized
met
and
vanquished
he
must
be
by
god
help
in
this
and
that
encounter
before
you
can
be
truly
called
a
man
before
you
can
really
enjoy
any
one
even
of
this
world
good
things
this
strife
was
no
light
one
for
our
hero
on
the
night
in
his
life
at
which
we
have
arrived
the
quiet
sky
overhead
the
quiet
solemn
old
buildings
under
the
shadow
of
which
he
stood
brought
him
no
peace
he
fled
from
them
into
his
own
rooms
he
lighted
his
candles
and
tried
to
read
and
force
the
whole
matter
from
his
thoughts
but
it
was
useless
back
it
came
again
and
again
the
more
impatient
of
its
presence
he
became
the
less
could
he
shake
it
off
some
decision
he
must
make
what
should
it
be
he
could
have
no
peace
till
it
was
taken
the
veil
had
been
drawn
aside
thoroughly
and
once
for
all
twice
he
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
hardy
rooms
to
thank
him
confess
and
consult
but
the
tide
rolled
back
again
as
the
truth
of
the
warning
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
him
the
irritation
against
him
who
had
uttered
it
grew
also
he
could
not
and
would
not
be
fair
yet
it
is
no
easy
thing
for
anyone
of
us
to
put
the
whole
burden
of
any
folly
or
sin
on
our
own
backs
all
at
once
if
he
had
done
it
in
any
other
way
thought
tom
i
might
have
thanked
him
another
effort
to
shake
off
the
whole
question
down
into
the
quadrangle
again
lights
in
drysdale
rooms
he
goes
up
and
finds
the
remains
of
the
supper
tankards
full
of
and
cardinal
and
a
party
playing
at
he
drinks
freely
careless
of
training
or
anxious
only
to
drown
thought
he
sits
down
to
play
the
boisterous
talk
of
some
the
eager
keen
looks
of
others
jar
on
him
equally
one
minute
he
is
absent
the
next
boisterous
then
irritable
then
moody
a
college
is
no
place
for
him
he
loses
his
money
is
disgusted
at
last
and
gets
to
his
own
rooms
by
midnight
goes
to
bed
feverish
dissatisfied
with
himself
with
all
the
world
the
inexorable
question
pursues
him
even
into
the
strange
helpless
land
of
dreams
demanding
a
decision
when
he
has
no
longer
power
of
will
to
choose
either
good
or
evil
but
how
fared
it
all
this
time
with
the
physician
alas
little
better
than
with
his
patient
his
was
the
deeper
and
more
sensitive
nature
keenly
conscious
of
his
own
position
he
had
always
avoided
any
but
the
most
formal
intercourse
with
the
men
in
his
college
whom
he
would
have
liked
most
to
live
with
this
was
the
first
friendship
he
had
made
amongst
them
and
he
valued
it
accordingly
and
now
it
seemed
to
lie
at
his
feet
in
hopeless
fragments
and
cast
down
too
by
his
own
hand
bitterly
he
blamed
himself
over
and
over
again
as
he
recalled
every
word
that
had
passed
not
for
having
spoken
that
he
felt
had
been
a
sacred
duty
but
for
the
harshness
and
suddenness
with
which
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
done
it
one
touch
of
gentleness
or
sympathy
and
i
might
have
won
him
as
it
was
how
could
he
have
met
me
otherwise
than
he
did
hard
word
for
hard
word
hasty
answer
for
proud
reproof
can
i
go
to
him
and
recall
it
all
no
i
ca
trust
myself
i
shall
only
make
matters
worse
besides
he
may
think
that
the
servitor
ah
am
i
there
again
the
old
sore
self
self
self
i
nurse
my
own
pride
i
value
it
more
than
my
friend
and
yet
no
no
i
can
not
go
though
i
think
i
could
die
for
him
the
sin
if
sin
there
must
be
be
on
my
head
would
to
god
i
could
bear
the
sting
of
it
but
there
will
be
none
how
can
i
fear
he
is
too
true
too
manly
rough
and
brutal
as
my
words
have
been
they
have
shown
him
the
gulf
he
will
he
must
escape
it
but
will
he
ever
come
back
to
me
i
care
not
so
he
escape
how
can
my
poor
words
follow
the
strong
loving
man
in
the
wrestlings
of
his
spirit
till
far
on
in
the
quiet
night
he
laid
the
whole
before
the
lord
and
slept
yes
my
brother
even
so
the
old
old
story
but
start
not
at
the
phrase
though
you
may
never
have
found
its
meaning
he
laid
the
whole
before
the
lord
in
prayer
for
his
friend
for
himself
for
the
whole
world
and
you
too
if
ever
you
are
tried
as
he
was
as
every
man
must
be
in
one
way
or
another
must
learn
to
do
the
like
with
every
burthen
on
your
soul
if
you
would
not
have
it
hanging
round
you
heavily
and
ever
more
heavily
and
dragging
you
down
lower
and
lower
till
your
dying
day
chapter
xvi
the
storm
rages
hardy
was
early
in
the
chapel
the
next
morning
it
was
his
week
for
pricking
in
every
man
who
entered
from
the
early
men
who
strolled
in
quietly
while
the
bell
was
still
ringing
to
the
hurrying
loiterers
who
crushed
in
as
the
porter
was
closing
the
doors
and
disturbed
the
congregation
in
the
middle
of
the
confession
gave
him
a
turn
as
the
expressive
phrase
is
and
every
turn
only
ended
in
disappointment
he
put
by
his
list
at
last
when
the
doors
were
fairly
shut
with
a
sigh
he
had
half
expected
to
see
tom
come
into
morning
chapel
with
a
face
from
which
he
might
have
gathered
hope
that
his
friend
had
taken
the
right
path
but
tom
did
not
come
at
all
and
hardy
felt
it
was
a
bad
sign
they
did
not
meet
till
the
evening
at
the
river
when
the
boat
went
down
for
a
steady
pull
and
then
hardy
saw
at
once
that
all
was
going
wrong
neither
spoke
to
or
looked
at
the
other
hardy
expected
some
one
to
remark
it
but
nobody
did
after
the
pull
they
walked
up
and
tom
as
usual
led
the
way
as
if
nothing
had
happened
into
the
choughs
hardy
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
went
in
too
and
stayed
till
the
rest
of
the
crew
left
tom
deliberately
stayed
after
them
all
hardy
turned
for
a
moment
as
he
was
leaving
the
bar
and
saw
him
settling
himself
down
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
defiance
meant
evidently
for
him
which
would
have
made
most
men
angry
he
was
irritated
for
a
moment
and
then
was
filled
with
roth
for
the
poor
youngster
who
was
heaping
up
coals
of
fire
for
his
own
head
in
his
momentary
anger
hardy
said
to
himself
well
i
have
done
what
i
can
now
he
must
go
his
own
way
but
such
a
thought
was
soon
kicked
in
disgrace
from
his
noble
and
mind
he
resolved
that
let
it
cost
what
it
might
in
the
shape
of
loss
of
time
and
trial
of
temper
he
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
and
spare
no
pains
to
deliver
his
friend
of
yesterday
from
the
slough
into
which
he
was
plunging
how
he
might
best
work
for
this
end
occupied
his
thoughts
as
he
walked
towards
college
tom
sat
on
at
the
choughs
glorifying
himself
in
the
thought
that
now
at
any
rate
he
had
shown
hardy
that
he
was
to
be
dragooned
into
doing
or
not
doing
anything
he
had
had
a
bad
time
of
it
all
day
and
his
good
angel
had
fought
hard
for
victory
but
was
too
strong
for
the
time
when
he
stayed
behind
the
rest
it
was
more
out
of
bravado
than
from
any
defined
purpose
of
pursuing
what
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
was
an
innocent
flirtation
when
he
left
the
house
some
hours
after
he
was
deeper
in
the
toils
than
ever
and
dark
clouds
were
gathering
over
his
heart
from
that
time
he
was
an
altered
man
and
altering
as
rapidly
for
the
worse
in
body
as
in
mind
hardy
saw
the
change
in
both
and
groaned
over
it
in
secret
miller
quick
eye
detected
the
bodily
change
after
the
next
race
he
drew
tom
aside
and
said
why
brown
what
the
matter
what
have
you
been
about
breaking
down
hold
on
man
there
only
one
more
night
never
fear
said
tom
proudly
i
shall
last
it
out
and
in
the
last
race
he
did
his
work
again
though
it
cost
him
more
than
all
the
preceding
ones
put
together
and
when
he
got
out
of
the
boat
he
could
scarcely
walk
or
see
he
felt
a
fierce
kind
of
joy
in
his
own
distress
and
wished
that
there
were
more
races
to
come
but
miller
as
he
walked
up
with
the
captain
took
a
different
view
of
the
subject
well
it
all
right
you
see
said
the
captain
but
we
not
a
boat
length
better
than
oriel
over
the
course
after
all
how
was
it
we
bumped
them
if
anything
they
drew
on
us
ay
half
a
boat
length
i
should
say
answered
miller
uncommonly
glad
it
over
brown
is
going
all
to
pieces
he
would
stand
another
race
and
we
have
a
man
to
put
in
his
place
it
odd
too
said
the
captain
i
put
him
down
as
a
laster
and
he
has
trained
well
perhaps
he
has
overdone
it
a
little
however
it
do
matter
now
so
the
races
were
over
and
that
night
a
great
supper
was
held
in
ambrose
hall
to
which
were
bidden
and
came
the
crews
of
all
the
boats
from
exeter
upwards
the
dean
with
many
misgivings
and
cautions
had
allowed
the
hall
to
be
used
on
pressure
from
miller
and
jervis
miller
was
a
bachelor
and
had
taken
a
good
degree
and
jervis
bore
a
high
character
and
was
expected
to
do
well
in
the
schools
so
the
poor
dean
gave
in
to
them
extracting
many
promises
in
exchange
for
his
permission
and
flitted
uneasily
about
all
the
evening
in
his
cap
and
gown
instead
of
working
on
at
his
edition
of
the
fathers
which
occupied
every
minute
of
his
leisure
and
was
making
an
old
man
of
him
before
his
time
from
eight
to
eleven
the
fine
old
pointed
windows
of
ambrose
hall
blazed
with
light
and
the
choruses
of
songs
and
the
cheers
which
followed
the
short
intervals
of
silence
which
the
speeches
made
rang
out
over
the
quadrangles
and
made
the
poor
dean
amble
about
in
a
state
of
nervous
bewilderment
inside
there
was
hearty
feasting
such
as
had
not
been
seen
there
for
aught
i
know
since
the
day
when
the
king
came
back
to
enjoy
his
own
again
the
one
old
cup
relic
of
the
middle
ages
which
had
survived
the
civil
wars
ambrose
had
been
a
right
loyal
college
and
the
plate
had
gone
without
a
murmur
into
charles
the
went
round
and
round
and
rival
crews
pledged
one
another
out
of
it
and
the
massive
tankards
of
a
later
day
in
all
good
faith
and
good
fellowship
mailed
knights
grave
bishops
royal
persons
of
either
sex
and
other
our
benefactors
looked
down
on
the
scene
from
their
heavy
gilded
frames
and
let
us
hope
not
unkindly
all
passed
off
well
and
quietly
the
men
were
gone
the
lights
were
out
and
the
butler
had
locked
the
hall
door
by
a
quarter
past
eleven
and
the
dean
returned
in
peace
to
his
own
rooms
had
tom
been
told
a
week
before
that
he
would
not
have
enjoyed
that
night
that
it
would
not
have
been
amongst
the
happiest
and
proudest
of
his
life
he
would
have
set
his
informer
down
as
a
madman
as
it
was
he
never
once
rose
to
the
spirit
of
the
feast
and
wished
it
all
over
a
dozen
times
he
deserved
not
to
enjoy
it
but
not
so
hardy
who
was
nevertheless
almost
as
much
out
of
tune
as
tom
though
the
university
coxswain
had
singled
him
out
named
him
in
his
speech
sat
by
him
and
talked
to
him
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
asked
him
to
go
to
the
henley
and
thames
regattas
in
the
oxford
crew
the
next
evening
as
usual
tom
found
himself
at
the
choughs
with
half
a
dozen
others
patty
was
in
the
bar
by
herself
looking
prettier
than
ever
one
by
one
the
rest
of
the
men
dropped
off
the
last
saying
are
you
coming
brown
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
he
sat
still
watching
patty
as
she
flitted
about
washing
up
the
ale
glasses
and
putting
them
on
their
shelves
and
getting
out
her
work
basket
and
then
she
came
and
sat
down
in
her
chair
opposite
him
and
began
stitching
away
demurely
at
an
apron
she
was
making
then
he
broke
silence
where
your
aunt
patty
oh
she
has
gone
away
for
a
few
days
for
a
visit
to
some
friends
you
and
i
will
keep
house
then
together
you
shall
teach
me
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
i
shall
make
a
famous
barman
you
think
you
must
learn
to
behave
better
then
but
i
promised
aunt
to
shut
up
at
nine
so
you
must
go
when
it
strikes
now
promise
me
you
will
go
go
at
nine
what
in
half
an
hour
the
first
evening
i
have
ever
had
a
chance
of
spending
alone
with
you
do
you
think
it
likely
and
he
looked
into
her
eyes
she
turned
away
with
a
slight
shiver
and
a
deep
blush
his
nervous
system
had
been
so
unusually
excited
in
the
last
few
days
that
he
seemed
to
know
everything
that
was
passing
in
her
mind
he
took
her
hand
why
patty
you
not
afraid
of
me
surely
he
said
gently
no
not
when
you
like
you
are
now
but
you
frightened
me
just
this
minute
i
never
saw
you
look
so
before
has
anything
happened
to
you
no
nothing
now
then
we
going
to
have
a
jolly
evening
and
play
darby
and
joan
together
he
said
turning
away
and
going
to
the
bar
window
shall
i
shut
up
patty
no
it
is
nine
yet
somebody
may
come
in
that
just
why
i
mean
to
put
the
shutters
up
i
do
want
anybody
yes
but
i
do
though
now
i
declare
brown
if
you
go
on
shutting
up
i
run
into
the
kitchen
and
sit
with
dick
why
will
you
call
me
brown
why
what
should
i
call
you
tom
of
course
oh
i
never
one
would
think
you
was
my
brother
said
patty
looking
up
with
a
pretty
pertness
which
she
had
a
most
bewitching
way
of
putting
on
tom
rejoinder
and
the
little
squabble
which
they
had
afterward
about
where
her
should
stand
and
other
such
matters
may
be
passed
over
at
last
he
was
brought
to
reason
and
to
anchor
opposite
his
enchantress
the
between
them
and
he
sat
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
watching
her
as
she
stitched
away
without
ever
lifting
her
eyes
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
break
the
silence
the
position
was
particularly
fascinating
to
him
for
he
had
scarcely
ever
yet
had
a
good
look
at
her
before
without
fear
of
attracting
attention
or
being
interrupted
at
last
he
roused
himself
any
of
our
men
been
here
patty
he
said
sitting
up
there
now
i
won
she
laughed
i
said
to
myself
i
speak
first
and
i
have
what
a
time
you
were
i
thought
you
would
never
begin
you
a
little
goose
now
i
begin
then
who
been
here
of
your
college
let
me
see
and
she
looked
away
across
to
the
bar
window
pricking
her
needle
into
the
table
there
was
drysdale
and
some
others
called
for
a
glass
of
ale
as
they
passed
going
out
driving
then
there
was
smith
and
them
from
the
boats
about
four
and
that
ugly
one
i
ca
mind
his
name
what
hardy
yes
that
it
he
was
here
about
six
and
what
hardy
here
after
hall
interrupted
tom
utterly
astonished
yes
after
your
dinner
up
at
college
he
been
here
two
or
three
times
lately
the
deuce
he
has
yes
and
he
talks
so
pleasant
to
aunt
too
i
sure
he
is
a
very
nice
gentleman
after
all
he
sat
and
talked
tonight
for
half
an
hour
i
should
think
what
did
he
talk
about
said
tom
with
a
sneer
oh
he
asked
me
whether
i
had
a
mother
and
where
i
came
from
and
all
about
my
bringing
up
and
made
me
feel
quite
pleasant
he
is
so
nice
and
quiet
and
respectful
not
like
most
of
you
going
to
like
him
very
much
as
you
told
me
i
do
tell
you
so
now
but
you
did
say
he
was
your
great
friend
well
he
is
that
now
what
have
you
quarreled
yes
dear
dear
how
odd
you
gentlemen
are
why
it
is
a
very
odd
thing
for
men
to
quarrel
is
it
no
not
in
the
public
room
they
always
quarreling
there
over
their
drink
and
the
and
dick
has
to
turn
them
out
but
gentlemen
ought
to
know
better
they
do
you
see
patty
but
what
did
you
quarrel
about
guess
how
can
i
guess
what
was
it
about
about
you
about
me
she
said
looking
up
from
her
work
in
wonder
how
could
you
quarrel
about
me
well
i
tell
you
he
said
i
had
no
right
to
come
here
you
wo
like
him
after
that
will
you
patty
i
do
know
i
sure
said
patty
going
on
with
her
work
and
looking
troubled
they
sat
still
for
some
minutes
evil
thoughts
crowded
into
head
he
was
in
the
humor
for
thinking
evil
thoughts
and
putting
the
worst
construction
on
hardy
visits
fancied
he
came
there
as
his
rival
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
till
he
had
mastered
his
precious
discovery
and
put
it
away
in
the
back
of
his
heart
and
weighed
it
down
there
with
a
good
covering
of
hatred
and
revenge
to
be
brought
out
as
occasion
should
serve
he
was
plunging
down
rapidly
enough
now
but
he
had
new
motives
for
making
the
most
of
his
time
and
never
played
his
cards
better
or
made
more
progress
when
a
man
sits
down
to
such
a
game
the
devil
will
take
good
care
he
want
cunning
or
strength
it
was
ten
instead
of
nine
before
he
left
which
he
did
with
a
feeling
of
triumph
poor
patty
remained
behind
and
shut
up
the
bar
her
heart
in
a
flutter
and
her
hands
shaking
while
dick
was
locking
the
front
door
she
hardly
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
she
felt
the
change
which
had
come
over
him
and
was
half
fascinated
and
half
repelled
by
it
tom
walked
quickly
back
to
college
in
a
mood
which
i
do
not
care
to
describe
the
only
one
of
his
thoughts
which
my
readers
need
be
troubled
with
put
itself
into
some
such
words
as
these
in
his
head
so
it
abingdon
fair
next
thursday
and
she
has
to
go
with
me
i
know
i
can
make
it
certain
be
going
besides
drysdale
i
be
bound
i
go
and
see
him
on
entering
college
he
went
straight
to
drysdale
rooms
and
drank
deeply
and
played
high
into
the
short
hours
of
the
night
but
found
no
opportunity
of
speaking
deeper
and
deeper
yet
for
the
next
few
days
downwards
and
ever
faster
downwards
he
plunged
the
light
getting
fainter
and
ever
fainter
above
his
head
little
good
can
come
of
dwelling
on
those
days
he
left
off
pulling
shunned
his
old
friends
and
lived
with
the
very
worst
men
he
knew
in
college
who
were
ready
enough
to
let
him
share
all
their
brutal
orgies
drysdale
who
was
often
present
wondered
at
the
change
which
he
saw
plainly
enough
he
was
sorry
for
it
in
his
way
but
it
was
no
business
of
his
he
began
to
think
that
brown
was
a
good
enough
fellow
before
but
would
make
a
devilish
disagreeable
one
if
he
was
going
to
turn
fast
man
at
the
choughs
all
went
on
as
if
the
downward
path
knew
how
to
make
itself
smooth
now
that
the
races
were
over
and
so
many
other
attractions
were
going
on
in
oxford
very
few
men
came
in
to
interfere
with
him
he
was
scarcely
ever
away
from
side
in
the
evenings
while
her
aunt
was
absent
and
gained
more
and
more
power
over
her
he
might
have
had
some
compassion
but
that
he
was
spurred
on
by
hearing
how
hardy
haunted
the
place
now
at
times
when
he
could
not
be
there
he
felt
that
there
was
an
influence
struggling
with
his
in
the
girl
mind
he
laid
it
to
hardy
door
and
imputed
it
still
more
and
more
to
motives
as
base
as
his
own
but
abingdon
fair
was
coming
on
thursday
when
he
left
the
choughs
on
tuesday
night
he
had
extracted
a
promise
from
patty
to
accompany
him
there
and
had
arranged
their
place
of
meeting
all
that
remained
to
be
done
was
to
see
if
drysdale
was
going
somehow
he
felt
a
disinclination
to
go
alone
with
patty
drysdale
was
the
only
man
of
those
he
was
now
living
with
to
whom
he
felt
the
least
attraction
in
a
vague
way
he
clung
to
him
and
though
he
never
faced
the
thought
of
what
he
was
about
fairly
yet
it
passed
through
his
mind
that
even
in
drysdale
company
he
would
be
safer
than
if
alone
it
was
all
pitiless
blind
wild
work
without
rudder
or
compass
the
wish
that
nothing
very
bad
might
come
out
of
it
all
however
came
up
in
spite
of
him
now
and
again
and
he
looked
to
drysdale
and
longed
to
become
even
as
he
drysdale
was
going
he
was
very
reserved
on
the
subject
but
at
last
confessed
that
he
was
not
going
alone
tom
persisted
drysdale
was
too
lazy
and
careless
to
keep
anything
from
a
man
who
was
bent
on
knowing
it
in
the
end
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
drive
tom
out
the
next
afternoon
he
did
so
they
stopped
at
a
small
public
house
some
two
miles
out
of
oxford
the
cart
was
put
up
and
after
carefully
scanning
the
neighborhood
they
walked
quickly
to
the
door
of
a
pretty
retired
cottage
as
they
entered
drysdale
said
by
jove
i
thought
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
your
friend
hardy
at
that
turn
friend
he
no
friend
of
mine
but
did
you
see
him
no
they
reached
college
again
between
ten
and
eleven
and
parted
each
to
his
own
rooms
to
his
surprise
tom
found
a
candle
burning
on
his
table
round
the
candle
was
tied
a
piece
of
string
at
the
end
of
which
hung
a
note
who
ever
had
put
it
there
had
clearly
been
anxious
that
he
should
in
no
case
miss
it
when
he
came
in
he
took
it
up
and
saw
that
it
was
in
hardy
hand
he
paused
and
trembled
as
he
stood
then
with
an
effort
he
broke
the
seal
and
read
i
must
speak
once
more
it
may
be
too
late
if
you
go
to
abingdon
fair
with
her
in
the
company
of
drysdale
and
his
mistress
or
i
believe
in
any
company
you
will
return
a
scoundrel
and
she
in
the
name
of
the
honor
of
your
mother
and
sister
in
the
name
of
god
i
warn
you
may
he
help
you
through
it
john
hardy
here
we
will
drop
the
curtain
for
the
next
hour
at
the
end
of
that
time
tom
staggered
out
of
his
room
down
the
staircase
across
the
quadrangle
up
drysdale
staircase
he
paused
at
the
door
to
gather
some
strength
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
and
arranged
his
coat
notwithstanding
when
he
entered
drysdale
started
to
his
feet
upsetting
jack
from
his
comfortable
coil
on
the
sofa
why
brown
you
ill
have
some
brandy
he
said
and
went
to
his
cupboard
for
the
bottle
tom
leant
his
arm
on
the
fireplace
his
head
on
it
the
other
hung
down
by
his
side
and
jack
licked
it
and
he
loved
the
dog
as
he
felt
the
caress
then
drysdale
came
to
his
side
with
a
glass
of
brandy
which
he
took
and
tossed
off
as
though
it
had
been
water
thank
you
he
said
and
as
drysdale
went
back
with
the
bottle
reached
a
large
armchair
and
sat
down
in
it
drysdale
i
go
with
you
to
abingdon
fair
hullo
what
has
the
lovely
patty
thrown
you
over
said
drysdale
turning
from
the
cupboard
and
resuming
his
lounge
on
the
sofa
no
he
sank
back
into
the
chair
on
the
arms
of
which
his
elbows
rested
and
put
his
hands
up
before
his
face
pressing
them
against
his
burning
temples
drysdale
looked
at
him
hard
but
said
nothing
and
there
was
a
dead
silence
of
a
minute
or
so
broken
only
by
tom
heavy
breathing
which
he
labored
in
vain
to
control
no
he
repeated
at
last
and
the
remaining
words
came
out
slowly
as
they
were
trying
to
steady
themselves
but
by
god
drysdale
i
take
her
with
you
and
that
a
dead
pause
the
young
lady
you
met
eh
tom
nodded
but
said
nothing
well
old
fellow
said
drysdale
now
you
made
up
your
mind
i
tell
you
i
devilish
glad
of
it
i
no
saint
as
you
know
but
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
d
d
shame
if
you
had
taken
her
with
us
thank
you
said
tom
and
pressed
his
fingers
tighter
on
his
forehead
and
he
did
feel
thankful
for
the
words
though
coming
from
such
a
man
they
went
into
him
like
coals
of
fire
again
there
was
a
long
pause
tom
sitting
as
before
drysdale
got
up
and
strolled
up
and
down
his
room
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
lounging
coat
taking
at
each
turn
a
steady
look
at
the
other
presently
he
stopped
and
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
i
say
brown
he
said
after
another
minute
contemplation
of
the
figure
before
him
which
bore
such
an
unmistakable
impress
of
wretchedness
that
it
made
him
quite
uncomfortable
why
do
you
cut
that
concern
how
do
you
mean
said
tom
why
that
business
i
be
hanged
if
it
wo
kill
you
or
make
a
devil
of
you
before
long
if
you
go
on
with
it
it
not
far
from
that
now
so
i
see
and
i
tell
you
what
you
not
the
sort
of
fellow
to
go
in
for
this
kind
of
thing
you
better
leave
it
to
brutes
like
some
we
know
i
need
mention
names
i
awfully
wretched
drysdale
i
been
a
brute
my
self
to
you
and
everybody
of
late
well
i
own
i
do
like
the
new
side
of
you
now

up
your
mind
to
cut
the
whole
concern
old
fellow
he
said
coming
up
goodnaturedly
and
putting
his
hand
on
tom
shoulder
it
hard
to
do
i
dare
say
but
you
had
better
make
a
plunge
and
get
it
over
there
wickedness
enough
going
about
without
your
helping
to
shove
another
one
into
it
tom
groaned
as
he
listened
but
he
felt
that
the
man
was
trying
to
help
him
in
his
own
way
and
according
to
his
light
as
drysdale
went
on
expounding
his
own
curious
code
of
morality
when
it
was
ended
he
shook
drysdale
hand
and
wishing
him
good
night
went
back
to
his
own
rooms
the
first
step
upwards
towards
the
light
had
been
made
for
he
felt
thoroughly
humbled
before
the
man
on
whom
he
had
expended
in
his
own
mind
so
much
patronizing
pity
for
the
last
half
year
whom
he
had
been
fancying
he
was
influencing
for
good
during
the
long
hours
of
the
night
the
scenes
of
the
last
few
hours
of
the
last
few
days
came
back
to
him
and
burnt
into
his
soul
the
gulf
yawned
before
him
now
plain
enough
open
at
his
feet
black
ghastly
he
shuddered
at
it
wondering
if
he
should
even
yet
fall
in
felt
wildly
about
for
strength
to
stand
firm
to
retrace
his
steps
but
found
it
not
he
found
not
yet
the
strength
he
was
in
search
of
but
in
the
grey
morning
he
wrote
a
short
note
i
shall
not
be
able
to
take
you
to
abingdon
fair
you
will
not
see
me
perhaps
for
some
days
i
am
not
well
i
am
very
sorry
do
think
that
i
am
changed
do
be
unhappy
or
i
do
know
what
i
may
do
there
was
no
address
and
no
signature
to
the
note
when
the
gates
opened
he
hurried
out
of
the
college
and
having
left
it
and
a
shilling
with
dick
whom
he
found
cleaning
the
yard
and
much
astonished
at
his
appearance
and
who
promised
to
deliver
it
to
patty
with
his
own
hands
before
eight
he
got
back
again
to
his
own
rooms
went
to
bed
worn
out
in
mind
and
body
and
slept
till
chapter
xvii
new
ground
my
readers
have
now
been
steadily
at
oxford
for
six
months
without
moving
most
people
find
such
a
spell
of
the
place
without
a
change
quite
as
much
as
they
care
to
take
perhaps
too
it
may
do
our
hero
good
to
let
him
alone
for
a
little
that
he
may
have
time
to
look
steadily
into
the
pit
which
he
has
been
so
near
falling
down
which
is
still
yawning
awkwardly
in
his
path
moreover
the
exigencies
of
a
story
teller
must
lead
him
away
from
home
now
and
then
like
the
rest
of
us
his
family
must
have
change
of
air
or
he
has
to
go
off
to
see
a
friend
properly
married
or
a
connexion
buried
to
wear
white
or
black
gloves
with
or
for
some
one
carrying
such
sympathy
as
he
can
with
him
so
that
he
may
come
back
from
every
journey
however
short
with
a
wider
horizon
yes
to
come
back
home
after
every
stage
of
life
journeying
with
a
wider
horizon
more
in
sympathy
with
men
and
nature
knowing
ever
more
of
the
righteous
and
eternal
laws
which
govern
them
and
of
the
righteous
and
loving
will
which
is
above
all
and
around
all
and
beneath
all
this
must
be
the
end
and
aim
of
all
of
us
or
we
shall
be
wandering
about
blindfold
and
spending
time
and
labor
and
on
that
which
profiteth
nothing
so
now
i
must
ask
my
readers
to
forget
the
old
buildings
and
quadrangles
of
the
fairest
of
england
cities
the
caps
and
the
gowns
the
reading
and
rowing
for
a
short
space
and
take
a
flight
with
me
to
other
scenes
and
pastures
new
the
nights
are
pleasant
in
may
short
and
pleasant
for
travel
we
will
leave
the
ancient
city
asleep
and
do
our
flight
in
the
night
to
save
time
trust
yourself
then
to
the
aerial
machine
it
is
but
a
rough
affair
i
own
rough
and
humble
unfitted
for
high
or
great
flights
with
no
gilded
panels
or
dainty
cushions
or
not
that
we
shall
care
about
springs
by
the
way
until
we
alight
on
terra
firma
again
still
there
is
much
to
be
learned
in
a
carriage
if
we
will
only
not
look
while
in
it
for
cushions
and
fine
panels
and
forty
miles
an
hour
traveling
and
will
not
be
shocked
at
our
fellow
passengers
for
being
weak
in
their
h
and
smelling
of
fustian
mount
in
it
then
you
who
will
after
this
warning
the
fares
are
holiday
fares
the
tickets
return
tickets
take
with
you
nothing
but
the
poet
luggage
a
smile
for
hope
a
tear
for
pain
a
breath
to
swell
the
voice
of
prayer
and
may
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
for
it
is
time
that
the
stoker
should
be
looking
to
his
going
gear
so
now
we
rise
slowly
in
the
moonlight
from
quadrangle
and
when
we
are
clear
of
the
steer
away
southwards
over
oxford
city
and
all
its
sleeping
wisdom
and
folly
over
street
and
past
spire
over
christ
church
and
the
canons
houses
and
the
fountain
in
tom
quad
over
and
the
river
along
which
the
moonbeams
lie
in
a
pathway
of
twinkling
silver
over
the
railway
sheds
no
there
was
then
no
railway
but
only
the
quiet
fields
and
footpaths
of
hincksey
hamlet
well
no
matter
at
any
rate
the
hills
beyond
and
bagley
wood
were
there
then
as
now
and
over
hills
and
wood
we
rise
catching
the
purr
of
the
the
trill
of
the
nightingale
and
the
first
crow
of
the
earliest
as
he
stretches
his
jewelled
wings
conscious
of
his
strength
and
his
beauty
heedless
of
the
fellows
of
john
who
slumber
within
sight
of
his
perch
on
whose
hospitable
board
he
shall
one
day
lie
prone
on
his
back
with
fair
larded
breast
turned
upwards
for
the
having
crowed
his
last
crow
he
knows
it
not
what
matters
it
to
him
if
he
knew
it
could
a
bagley
wood
desire
a
better
ending
we
pass
over
the
vale
beyond
hall
and
hamlet
church
and
meadow
and
copse
folded
in
mist
and
shadow
below
us
each
hamlet
holding
in
its
bosom
the
material
of
three
volumed
novels
by
the
dozen
if
we
could
only
pull
off
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
look
steadily
into
the
interiors
but
our
destination
is
farther
yet
the
faint
white
streak
behind
the
distant
chilterns
reminds
us
that
we
have
no
time
for
gossip
by
the
way
may
nights
are
short
and
the
sun
will
be
up
by
four
no
matter
our
journey
will
now
be
soon
over
for
the
broad
vale
is
crossed
and
the
chalk
hills
and
downs
beyond
larks
quiver
up
by
us
higher
ever
higher
hastening
up
to
get
a
first
glimpse
of
the
coming
monarch
careless
of
food
flooding
the
fresh
air
with
song
steadily
plodding
rooks
labour
along
below
us
and
lively
starlings
rush
by
on
the
for
the
early
worm
lark
and
swallow
rook
and
starling
each
on
his
appointed
round
the
sun
arises
and
they
get
them
to
it
he
is
up
now
and
these
breezy
uplands
over
which
we
hang
are
swimming
in
the
light
of
horizontal
rays
though
the
shadows
and
mists
still
lie
on
the
wooded
dells
which
slope
away
southwards
here
let
us
bring
to
over
the
village
of
englebourn
and
try
to
get
acquainted
with
the
outside
of
the
place
before
the
good
folk
are
about
and
we
have
to
go
down
among
them
and
their
sayings
and
doings
the
village
lies
on
the
southern
slopes
of
the
berkshire
hills
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
under
which
our
hero
was
born
another
soil
altogether
is
here
we
remark
in
the
first
place
this
is
no
chalk
this
high
knoll
which
rises
above
one
may
almost
say
hangs
over
the
village
crowned
with
scotch
firs
its
sides
tufted
with
gorse
and
heather
it
is
the
hawk
lynch
the
favorite
resort
of
englebourn
folk
who
come
up
for
the
view
for
the
air
because
their
fathers
and
mothers
came
up
before
them
because
they
came
up
themselves
as
children
from
an
instinct
which
moves
them
all
in
leisure
hours
and
sunday
evenings
when
the
sun
shines
and
the
birds
sing
whether
they
care
for
view
or
air
or
not
something
guides
all
their
feet
hitherward
the
children
to
play
and
look
for
nests
in
the
young
men
and
maidens
to
saunter
and
look
and
talk
as
they
will
till
the
world
end
or
as
long
at
any
rate
as
the
hawk
lynch
and
englebourn
last
and
to
cut
their
initials
enclosed
in
a
true
lover
knot
on
the
short
turf
steady
married
couples
to
plod
along
together
consulting
on
hard
times
and
growing
families
even
old
tottering
men
who
love
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
firs
with
chins
leaning
on
their
sticks
prattling
of
days
long
past
to
anyone
who
will
listen
or
looking
silently
with
dim
eyes
into
the
summer
air
feeling
perhaps
in
their
spirits
after
a
wider
and
more
peaceful
view
which
will
soon
open
for
them
a
common
knoll
open
to
all
up
in
the
silent
air
well
away
from
englebourn
life
with
the
hampshire
range
and
the
distant
beacon
hill
lying
soft
on
the
horizon
and
nothing
higher
between
you
and
the
southern
sea
what
a
blessing
the
hawk
lynch
is
to
the
village
folk
one
and
all
may
heaven
and
a
thankless
soil
long
preserve
it
and
them
from
an
enclosure
under
the
act
there
is
much
temptation
lying
about
though
for
the
enclosers
of
the
world
the
rough
common
land
stretches
over
the
whole
of
the
knoll
and
down
to
its
base
and
away
along
the
hills
behind
of
which
the
hawk
lynch
is
an
outlying
spur
rough
common
land
broken
only
by
pine
woods
of
a
few
acres
each
in
extent
an
occasional
woodman
or
squatter
cottage
and
little
patch
of
attempted
garden
but
immediately
below
and
on
each
flank
of
the
spur
and
up
the
slopes
come
small
farm
enclosures
breaking
here
and
there
the
belt
of
woodlands
which
generally
lies
between
the
rough
wild
upland
and
the
cultivated
country
below
as
you
stand
on
the
knoll
you
can
see
common
land
just
below
you
at
its
foot
narrow
into
a
mere
road
with
a
border
of
waste
on
each
side
which
runs
into
englebourn
street
at
the
end
of
the
straggling
village
stands
the
church
with
its
square
tower
a
lofty
grey
stone
building
with
bits
of
fine
decorated
architecture
about
it
but
much
of
churchwarden
gothic
supervening
the
churchyard
is
large
and
the
graves
as
you
can
see
plainly
even
from
this
distance
are
all
crowded
on
the
southern
side
the
rector
sheep
are
feeding
in
the
northern
part
nearest
to
us
and
a
small
gate
at
one
corner
opens
into
his
garden
the
rectory
looks
large
and
comfortable
and
its
grounds
well
cared
for
and
extensive
with
a
rookery
of
elms
at
the
lawn
end
it
is
the
chief
house
of
the
place
for
there
is
no
resident
squire
the
principal
street
contains
a
few
shops
some
dozen
perhaps
in
all
and
several
farm
houses
lie
a
little
back
from
it
with
gardens
in
front
and
yards
and
barns
and
orchards
behind
and
there
are
two
the
other
dwellings
are
mere
cottages
and
very
bad
ones
for
the
most
part
with
floors
below
the
level
of
the
street
almost
every
house
in
the
village
is
thatched
which
adds
to
the
beauty
though
not
to
the
comfort
of
the
place
the
rest
of
the
population
who
do
not
live
in
the
street
are
dotted
about
the
neighboring
lanes
chiefly
towards
the
west
on
our
right
as
we
look
down
from
the
hawk
lynch
on
this
side
the
country
is
more
open
and
here
most
of
the
farmers
live
as
we
may
see
by
the
number
of
homesteads
and
there
is
a
small
brook
on
that
side
too
which
with
careful
damming
is
made
to
turn
a
mill
there
where
you
see
the
clump
of
poplars
on
our
left
as
we
look
down
the
country
to
the
east
of
the
village
is
thickly
wooded
but
we
can
see
that
there
is
a
village
green
on
that
side
and
a
few
scattered
cottages
the
farthest
of
which
stands
looking
out
like
a
little
white
eye
from
the
end
of
a
dense
copse
beyond
it
there
is
no
sign
of
habitation
for
some
two
miles
then
you
can
see
the
tall
chimneys
of
a
great
house
and
a
well
timbered
park
round
it
the
grange
is
not
in
englebourn
parish
happily
for
that
parish
one
is
sorry
to
remark
it
must
be
a
very
bad
squire
who
does
not
do
more
good
than
harm
by
living
in
a
country
village
but
there
are
very
bad
squires
and
the
owner
of
the
grange
is
one
of
them
he
is
however
for
the
most
part
an
absentee
so
that
we
are
little
concerned
with
him
and
in
fact
have
only
to
notice
this
one
of
his
bad
habits
that
he
keeps
that
long
belt
of
woodlands
which
runs
into
englebourn
parish
and
comes
almost
up
to
the
village
full
of
hares
and
pheasants
he
has
only
succeeded
to
the
property
some
three
or
four
years
and
yet
the
head
of
game
on
the
estate
and
above
all
in
the
woods
has
trebled
or
quadrupled
pheasants
by
hundreds
are
reared
under
hens
from
eggs
bought
in
london
and
run
about
the
keepers
houses
as
tame
as
barn
door
fowls
all
the
summer
when
the
first
party
comes
down
for
the
first
early
in
october
it
is
often
as
much
as
the
beaters
can
do
to
persuade
these
pampered
fowls
that
they
are
wild
game
whose
duty
it
is
to
get
up
and
fly
away
and
be
shot
at
however
they
soon
learn
more
of
the
world
such
of
them
at
least
as
are
not
slain
and
are
unmistakable
wild
birds
in
a
few
days
then
they
take
to
roosting
farther
from
their
old
haunts
more
in
the
outskirts
of
the
woods
and
the
time
comes
for
others
besides
the
guests
to
take
their
education
in
hand
and
teach
pheasants
at
least
that
they
are
no
native
british
birds
these
are
a
wild
set
living
scattered
about
the
wild
country
squatters
with
indefinite
occupations
and
nameless
habits
a
race
hated
of
keepers
and
constables
these
have
increased
and
flourished
of
late
years
and
notwithstanding
the
imprisonments
and
transportations
which
deprive
them
periodically
of
the
most
enterprising
members
of
their
community
one
and
all
give
thanks
for
the
day
when
the
owner
of
the
grange
took
to
pheasant
breeding
if
the
demoralization
stopped
with
them
little
harm
might
come
of
it
as
they
would
steal
fowls
in
the
homesteads
if
there
were
no
pheasants
in
the
woods
which
latter
are
less
dangerous
to
get
and
worth
more
when
gotten
but
unhappily
this
method
of
earning
a
livelihood
has
strong
attractions
and
is
catching
and
the
cases
of
farm
labourers
who
get
into
trouble
about
game
are
more
frequent
season
by
season
in
the
neighbouring
parishes
and
englebourn
is
no
better
than
the
rest
and
the
men
are
not
likely
to
be
much
discouraged
from
these
practices
or
taught
better
by
the
fanners
for
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
drives
that
sturdy
set
of
men
the
englebourn
yeomen
into
a
frenzy
it
is
talk
of
the
game
in
the
grange
covers
not
that
they
dislike
sport
they
like
it
too
well
and
moreover
have
been
used
to
their
fair
share
of
it
for
the
late
squire
left
the
game
entirely
in
their
hands
you
know
best
how
much
game
your
land
will
carry
without
serious
damage
to
the
crops
he
used
to
say
i
like
to
show
my
friends
a
fair
day
sport
when
they
are
with
me
and
have
enough
game
to
supply
the
house
and
make
a
few
presents
beyond
that
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
you
can
course
whenever
you
like
and
let
me
know
when
you
want
a
day
shooting
and
you
shall
have
it
under
this
system
the
yeomen
became
keen
sportsmen
they
and
all
their
labourers
took
a
keen
interest
in
preserving
and
the
whole
district
would
have
risen
on
a
poacher
the
keeper
place
became
a
sinecure
and
the
squire
had
as
much
game
as
he
wanted
without
expense
and
was
moreover
the
most
popular
man
in
the
county
even
after
the
new
man
came
and
all
was
changed
the
mere
revocation
of
their
sporting
liberties
and
the
increase
of
game
unpopular
as
these
things
were
would
not
alone
have
made
the
farmers
so
bitter
and
have
raised
that
sense
of
outraged
justice
in
them
but
with
these
changes
came
in
a
custom
new
in
the
country
the
custom
of
selling
the
game
at
first
the
report
was
not
believed
but
soon
it
became
notorious
that
no
head
of
game
from
the
grange
estates
was
ever
given
away
that
not
only
did
the
tenants
never
get
a
brace
of
birds
or
a
hare
or
the
labourers
a
rabbit
but
not
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
helped
to
kill
the
game
ever
found
any
of
the
bag
in
his
after
the
day
shooting
nay
so
shameless
had
the
system
become
and
so
highly
was
the
art
of
turning
the
game
to
account
cultivated
at
the
grange
that
the
keepers
sold
powder
and
shot
to
any
of
the
guests
who
had
emptied
their
own
belts
or
flasks
at
something
over
the
market
retail
price
the
light
cart
drove
to
the
twice
a
week
in
the
season
loaded
heavily
with
game
but
more
heavily
with
the
hatred
and
scorn
of
the
farmers
and
if
deep
and
bitter
curses
could
break
patent
axles
or
necks
the
new
squire
and
his
would
not
long
have
vexed
the
countryside
as
it
was
not
a
man
but
his
own
tenants
would
salute
him
in
the
and
these
repaid
themselves
for
the
unwilling
courtesy
by
bitter
reflections
on
a
squire
who
was
mean
enough
to
pay
his
butcher
and
poulterer
bills
out
of
their
pockets
alas
that
the
manly
instinct
of
sport
which
is
so
strong
in
all
of
us
englishmen
which
sends
oswells
single
handed
against
the
mightiest
beasts
that
walk
the
earth
and
takes
the
poor
cockney
journeyman
out
a
ten
miles
walk
almost
before
daylight
on
the
rare
summer
holiday
mornings
to
angle
with
rude
tackle
in
reservoir
or
canal
should
be
dragged
through
such
mire
as
this
in
many
an
english
shire
in
our
day
if
english
landlords
want
to
go
on
shooting
game
much
longer
they
must
give
up
selling
it
for
if
selling
game
becomes
the
rule
and
not
the
exception
as
it
seems
likely
to
do
before
long
to
sport
in
england
every
man
who
loves
his
country
more
than
his
pleasure
or
his
pocket
and
thank
god
that
includes
the
great
majority
of
us
yet
however
much
we
may
delight
in
gun
and
rod
let
any
demagogue
in
the
land
say
what
he
pleases
will
cry
down
with
it
and
lend
a
hand
to
put
it
down
for
ever
but
to
return
to
our
perch
on
the
hawk
lynch
above
englebourn
village
the
rector
is
the
fourth
of
his
race
who
holds
the
family
living
a
kind
gentlemanly
old
man
a
doctor
of
divinity
as
becomes
his
position
though
he
only
went
into
orders
because
there
was
the
living
ready
for
him
in
his
day
he
had
been
a
good
magistrate
and
neighbour
living
with
and
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
squires
round
about
but
his
contemporaries
had
dropped
off
one
by
one
his
own
health
had
long
been
failing
his
wife
was
dead
and
the
young
generation
did
not
seek
him
his
work
and
the
parish
had
no
real
hold
on
him
so
he
had
nothing
to
fall
back
on
and
had
become
a
confirmed
invalid
seldom
leaving
the
house
and
garden
even
to
go
to
church
and
thinking
more
of
his
dinner
and
his
health
than
of
all
other
things
in
earth
or
heaven
the
only
child
who
remained
at
home
with
him
was
a
daughter
a
girl
of
nineteen
or
thereabouts
whose
acquaintance
we
shall
make
presently
and
who
was
doing
all
that
a
good
heart
and
sound
head
prompted
in
nursing
an
old
hypochondriac
and
filling
his
place
in
the
parish
but
though
the
old
man
was
weak
and
selfish
he
was
kind
in
his
way
and
ready
to
give
freely
or
do
anything
that
his
daughter
suggested
for
the
good
of
his
people
provided
the
trouble
were
taken
off
his
shoulders
in
the
year
before
our
tale
opens
he
had
allowed
some
thirty
acres
of
his
glebe
to
be
parcelled
out
in
allotments
amongst
the
poor
and
his
daughter
spent
almost
what
she
pleased
in
and
and
the
school
without
a
word
from
him
whenever
he
did
remonstrate
she
managed
to
get
what
she
wanted
out
of
the
or
her
own
allowance
we
must
make
acquaintance
with
such
other
of
the
inhabitants
as
it
concerns
us
to
know
in
the
course
of
the
story
for
it
is
broad
daylight
and
the
villagers
will
be
astir
directly
folk
who
go
to
bed
before
nine
after
a
hard
day
work
get
into
the
habit
of
turning
out
soon
after
the
sun
calls
them
so
now
descending
from
the
hawk
lynch
we
will
alight
at
the
east
end
of
englebourn
opposite
the
little
white
cottage
which
looks
out
at
the
end
of
the
great
wood
near
the
village
green
soon
after
five
on
that
bright
sunday
morning
harry
winburn
unbolted
the
door
of
his
mother
cottage
and
stepped
out
in
his
on
to
the
little
walk
in
front
paved
with
pebbles
perhaps
some
of
my
readers
will
recognize
the
name
of
an
old
acquaintance
and
wonder
how
he
got
here
so
let
us
explain
at
once
soon
after
our
hero
went
to
school
harry
father
had
died
of
a
fever
he
had
been
a
journeyman
blacksmith
and
in
the
receipt
consequently
of
rather
better
wages
than
generally
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
peasantry
but
not
enough
to
leave
much
of
a
margin
over
current
expenditure
moreover
the
winburns
had
always
been
with
whatever
money
they
had
so
that
all
he
left
for
his
widow
and
child
of
worldly
goods
was
their
few
sticks
of
furniture
in
the
savings
bank
and
the
money
from
his
which
was
not
more
than
enough
to
give
him
a
creditable
funeral
that
object
of
honorable
ambition
to
all
the
independent
poor
he
left
however
another
inheritance
to
them
which
is
in
price
above
rubies
neither
shall
silver
be
named
in
comparison
thereof
the
inheritance
of
an
honest
name
of
which
his
widow
was
proud
and
which
was
not
likely
to
suffer
in
her
hands
after
the
funeral
she
removed
to
englebourn
her
own
native
village
and
kept
her
old
father
house
till
his
death
he
was
one
of
the
woodmen
to
the
grange
and
lived
in
the
cottage
at
the
corner
of
the
wood
in
which
his
work
lay
when
he
too
died
hard
times
came
on
widow
winburn
the
steward
allowed
her
to
keep
on
the
cottage
the
rent
was
a
sore
burden
to
her
but
she
would
sooner
have
starved
than
leave
it
parish
relief
was
out
of
the
question
for
her
father
child
and
her
husband
widow
so
she
turned
her
hand
to
every
odd
job
which
offered
and
went
to
work
in
the
fields
when
nothing
else
could
be
had
whenever
there
was
sickness
in
the
place
she
was
an
untiring
nurse
and
at
one
time
for
some
nine
months
she
took
the
office
of
postman
and
walked
daily
some
nine
miles
through
a
severe
winter
the
fatigue
and
exposure
had
broken
down
her
health
and
made
her
an
old
woman
before
her
time
at
last
in
a
lucky
hour
the
doctor
came
to
hear
of
her
praiseworthy
struggles
and
gave
her
the
rectory
washing
which
had
made
her
life
a
comparatively
easy
one
again
during
all
this
time
her
poor
neighbors
had
stood
by
her
as
the
poor
do
stand
by
one
another
helping
her
in
numberless
small
ways
so
that
she
had
been
able
to
realize
the
great
object
of
her
life
and
keep
harry
at
school
till
he
was
nearly
fourteen
by
this
time
he
had
learned
all
that
the
village
pedagogue
could
teach
and
had
in
fact
become
an
object
of
mingled
pride
and
jealousy
to
that
worthy
man
who
had
his
misgivings
lest
fame
as
a
scholar
should
eclipse
his
own
before
many
years
were
over
winburn
character
was
so
good
that
no
sooner
was
her
son
ready
for
a
place
than
a
place
was
ready
for
him
he
stepped
at
once
into
the
dignity
of
carter
boy
and
his
earnings
when
added
to
his
mother
made
them
comfortable
enough
of
course
she
was
wrapped
up
in
him
and
believed
that
there
was
no
such
boy
in
the
parish
and
indeed
she
was
nearer
the
truth
than
most
mothers
for
he
soon
grew
into
a
famous
specimen
of
a
countryman
tall
and
lithe
full
of
nervous
strength
and
not
yet
bowed
down
or
stiffened
by
the
constant
toil
of
a
labourer
daily
life
in
these
matters
however
he
had
rivals
in
the
village
but
in
intellectual
accomplishments
he
was
unrivalled
he
was
full
of
learning
according
to
the
village
standard
could
write
and
cipher
well
was
fond
of
reading
such
books
as
came
in
his
way
and
spoke
his
native
english
almost
without
an
accent
he
is
at
the
time
when
our
story
takes
him
up
a
thoroughly
skilled
labourer
the
best
hedger
and
ditcher
in
the
parish
and
when
his
blood
is
up
he
can
shear
twenty
sheep
in
a
day
without
razing
the
skin
or
mow
for
sixteen
hours
at
a
stretch
with
rests
of
half
an
hour
for
meals
twice
in
the
day
harry
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
for
a
minute
as
he
stood
outside
the
cottage
drinking
in
the
fresh
pure
air
laden
with
the
scent
of
the
honeysuckle
which
he
had
trained
over
the
porch
and
listening
to
the
chorus
of
linnets
and
finches
from
the
copse
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
then
set
about
the
household
duties
which
he
always
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
attend
to
himself
on
sundays
first
he
unshuttered
the
little
of
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
a
simple
enough
operation
for
the
shutter
was
a
mere
wooden
flap
which
was
closed
over
the
window
at
night
and
bolted
with
a
wooden
bolt
on
the
outside
and
thrown
back
against
the
wall
in
the
daytime
any
one
who
would
could
have
opened
it
at
any
moment
of
the
night
but
the
poor
sleep
sound
without
bolts
then
he
took
the
one
old
bucket
of
the
establishment
and
strode
away
to
the
well
on
the
village
green
and
filled
it
with
clear
cold
water
doing
the
same
kind
office
for
the
vessels
of
two
or
three
rosy
little
damsels
and
boys
of
ages
varying
from
ten
to
fourteen
who
were
already
astir
and
to
whom
the
of
the
parish
chain
and
bucket
would
have
been
a
work
of
difficulty
returning
to
the
cottage
he
proceeded
to
fill
his
mother
kettle
sweep
the
hearth
strike
a
light
and
make
up
the
fire
with
a
faggot
from
the
little
stack
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
then
he
hauled
the
round
table
before
the
fire
and
dusted
it
carefully
over
and
laid
out
the
black
japan
with
two
delf
cups
and
saucers
of
gorgeous
pattern
and
diminutive
plates
to
match
and
placed
the
sugar
and
slop
basins
the
big
loaf
and
small
piece
of
salt
butter
in
their
accustomed
places
and
the
little
black
teapot
on
the
hob
to
get
properly
warm
there
was
little
more
to
be
done
indoors
for
the
furniture
was
scanty
enough
but
everything
in
turn
received
its
fair
share
of
attention
and
the
little
room
with
its
sunken
tiled
floor
and
walls
looked
cheerful
and
homely
then
harry
turned
his
attention
to
the
shed
of
his
own
contriving
which
stood
beside
the
and
from
which
expostulatory
and
plaintive
grunts
had
been
issuing
ever
since
his
first
appearance
at
the
door
telling
of
a
faithful
and
useful
friend
who
was
sharp
set
on
sunday
mornings
and
desired
his
poor
breakfast
and
to
be
dismissed
for
the
day
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
his
livelihood
with
his
brethren
porkers
of
the
village
on
the
green
and
in
the
lanes
harry
served
out
to
the
porker
the
poor
mess
which
the
wash
of
the
cottage
and
the
odds
and
ends
of
the
little
garden
afforded
which
that
virtuous
animal
forthwith
began
to
discuss
with
both
in
the
trough
by
way
probably
of
adding
to
the
flavor
while
his
master
scratched
him
gently
between
the
ears
and
on
the
back
with
a
short
stick
till
the
repast
was
concluded
then
he
opened
the
door
of
the
stye
and
the
grateful
animal
rushed
out
into
the
lane
and
away
to
the
green
with
a
joyful
squeal
and
flirt
of
his
in
the
air
and
harry
after
picking
a
bunch
of
and
pansies
and
hyacinths
a
line
of
which
flowers
skirted
the
narrow
garden
walk
and
putting
them
in
a
glass
which
he
took
from
the
proceeded
to
his
morning
ablutions
ample
materials
for
which
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
family
bucket
which
he
had
put
down
on
a
little
bench
by
the
side
of
the
porch
these
finished
he
retired
indoors
to
shave
and
dress
himself
chapter
xviii
englebourne
village
dame
winburn
was
not
long
after
her
son
and
they
sat
down
together
to
breakfast
in
their
best
sunday
clothes
she
in
a
plain
large
white
cap
which
covered
all
but
a
line
of
grey
hair
a
black
stuff
gown
reaching
to
neck
and
wrists
and
small
silk
neckkerchief
put
on
like
a
shawl
a
thin
almost
gaunt
old
woman
whom
the
years
had
not
used
tenderly
and
who
showed
marks
of
their
usage
but
a
resolute
soul
who
had
met
hard
times
in
the
face
and
could
meet
them
again
if
need
were
she
spoke
in
broad
berkshire
and
was
otherwise
a
homely
body
but
and
without
a
shade
of
real
vulgarity
in
her
composition
the
widow
looked
with
some
anxiety
at
harry
as
he
took
his
seat
although
something
of
a
rustic
dandy
of
late
he
had
not
been
so
careful
in
the
matter
of
dress
as
usual
but
in
consequence
of
her
reproaches
on
this
sunday
there
was
nothing
to
complain
of
his
black
velveteen
shooting
coat
and
cotton
plush
waistcoat
his
brown
corduroy
and
gaiters
sat
on
him
well
and
gave
the
world
assurance
of
a
man
for
few
of
the
englebourn
labourers
rose
above
and
fustian
trousers
he
wore
a
blue
handkerchief
round
his
neck
and
his
shirt
though
coarse
in
texture
was
as
white
as
the
sun
and
the
best
laundress
in
englebourn
could
manage
to
bleach
it
there
was
nothing
to
find
fault
with
in
his
dress
therefore
but
still
his
mother
did
not
feel
quite
comfortable
as
she
took
stealthy
glances
at
him
harry
was
naturally
a
reserved
fellow
and
did
not
make
much
conversation
himself
and
his
mother
felt
a
little
embarrassed
on
this
particular
morning
it
was
not
therefore
until
dame
winburn
had
finished
her
first
slice
of
bread
and
butter
and
had
sipped
the
greater
part
of
her
second
dish
of
tea
out
of
her
saucer
that
she
broke
silence
i
minded
thy
business
last
night
harry
when
i
wur
up
at
the
rectory
about
the
washin
it
my

about

givin
more
nor
an
acre
to
any
man
as
worked
for
and
the
doctor
you
see
he
do
like
to
go
altogether
agin
the
vestry
folk
what
business
is
it
o
theirs
said
harry
so
long
as
they
get
their
own
work
done
there
scarce
one
on
as
has
more
land
already
nor
he
can
keep
as
should
be
and
for
all
that
they
want
to
snap
up
every
bit
as
falls
vacant
so
as
no
poor
man
shall
get
it
is
mostly
so
with
them
as
has
said
his
mother
with
a
half
puzzled
look
scriptur
says
as
to
them
shall
be
given
and
they
shall
have
more
abundant
dame
winburn
spoke
hesitatingly
and
looked
doubtfully
at
harry
as
a
person
who
has
shot
with
a
strange
gun
and
knows
not
what
effect
the
bolt
may
have
harry
was
brought
up
all
standing
by
this
unexpected
quotation
of
his
mother
but
after
thinking
for
a
few
moments
while
he
cut
himself
a
slice
of
bread
replied
it
do
say
as
those
shall
have
more
that
ca
use
what
they
got
already
is
a
deal
more
like
naboth
vineyard
for
aught
as
i
can
see
but
is
little
odds
to
me
which
way
it
goes
how
canst
talk
so
harry
said
his
mother
reproachfully
thou
thou
wast
set
on
it
last
fall
like
a
wasp
on
sugar
why
scarce
a
day
past
but
thou
wast
up
to
the
rectory
to
see
the
doctor
about
it
and
now
like
to
get
not
go
anyst
harry
looked
out
at
the
open
door
without
answering
it
was
quite
true
that
in
the
last
autumn
he
had
been
very
anxious
to
get
as
large
an
allotment
as
he
could
into
his
own
hands
and
that
he
had
been
for
ever
up
towards
the
rectory
but
perhaps
not
always
on
the
allotment
business
he
was
naturally
a
shrewd
fellow
and
felt
that
if
he
could
put
his
hand
on
three
or
four
acres
of
land
he
could
soon
make
himself
independent
of
the
farmers
he
knew
that
at
and
whenever
there
was
a
pinch
for
good
labourers
they
would
be
glad
enough
to
have
him
while
at
other
times
with
a
few
acres
of
his
own
he
would
be
his
own
master
and
could
do
much
better
for
himself
so
he
had
put
his
name
down
first
on
the
doctor
list
taken
the
largest
lot
he
could
get
and
worked
it
so
well
that
his
crops
amongst
others
had
been
a
sort
of
village
show
last
many
of
the
neighboring
allotments
stood
out
in
sad
contrast
to
those
of
harry
and
the
more
energetic
of
the
peasantry
and
lay
by
the
side
of
these
latter
only
half
worked
and
full
of
weeds
and
the
rent
was
never
ready
it
was
worse
than
useless
to
let
matters
go
on
thus
and
the
question
arose
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
neglected
lots
harry
and
all
the
men
like
him
applied
at
once
for
them
and
their
eagerness
to
get
them
had
roused
some
natural
jealousy
amongst
the
farmers
who
began
to
foresee
that
the
new
system
might
shortly
leave
them
with
none
but
the
worst
labourers
so
the
vestry
had
pressed
on
the
doctor
as
dame
winburn
said
not
to
let
any
man
have
more
than
an
acre
or
an
acre
and
a
half
and
the
invalid
old
man
could
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
so
here
was
may
again
and
the
neglected
lots
were
still
in
the
nominal
occupation
of
the
idlers
the
doctor
got
no
rent
and
was
annoyed
at
the
partial
failure
of
a
scheme
which
he
had
not
indeed
originated
but
for
which
he
had
taken
much
credit
to
himself
the
negligent
occupiers
grumbled
that
they
were
not
allowed
a
drawback
for
manure
and
that
no
pigstyes
were
put
up
for
them
was
allers
understood
so
they
maintained
and
they
never
ha
took
to
the
lots
but
for
that
the
good
men
grumbled
that
it
would
be
too
late
now
for
them
to
do
more
than
clean
the
lots
of
weeds
this
year
the
farmers
grumbled
that
it
was
always
understood
that
no
man
should
have
more
than
one
lot
the
poor
rector
had
led
his
flock
into
a
miry
place
with
a
vengeance
people
who
can
not
make
up
their
minds
breed
trouble
in
other
places
besides
country
villages
however
quiet
and
out
of
the
way
the
place
may
be
there
is
always
some
public
topic
which
stands
to
the
rural
englishman
in
the
place
of
treaty
or
budget
or
so
the
great
allotment
question
for
the
time
was
that
which
exercised
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
of
englebourn
and
until
lately
no
one
had
taken
a
keener
interest
in
it
than
harry
winburn
but
that
interest
had
now
much
abated
and
so
harry
looked
through
the
cottage
door
instead
of
answering
his
mother
is
my
belief
as
you
med
amost
hev
it
for
the
axin
dame
winburn
began
again
when
she
found
that
he
would
not
the
subject
himself
the
young
missus
said
as
much
to
me
herself
last
night
ah
to
be
sure
things
go
better
if
she
had
the
guidin
on
i
not
going
after
it
any
more
mother
we
can
keep
the
bits
sticks
here
together
without
it
while
you
be
alive
and
if
anything
was
to
happen
to
you
i
do
think
i
should
stay
in
these
parts
but
it
do
matter
what
becomes
o
me
i
can
earn
a
livelihood
anywhere
dame
winburn
paused
a
moment
before
answering
to
subdue
her
vexation
and
then
said
how
can
let
hankerin
arter
a
lass
take
the
heart
out
o
thee
so
hold
up
thy
head
and
act
a
bit
measterful
the
more
thow
makest
o
thyself
the
more
like
thou
art
to
win
did
you
hear
aught
of
her
last
night
mother
replied
harry
taking
advantage
of
this
ungracious
opening
to
speak
of
the
subject
which
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
i
heer
she
wur
goin
on
well
said
his
mother
no
likelihood
of
her
comin
home
not
as
i
could
make
out
why
she
hev
been
gone
not
four
months
now
do
pluck
up
a
bit
harry
and
be
more
like
thyself
why
mother
i
not
missed
a
day
work
since
christmas
so
there
ai
much
to
find
fault
with
nay
harry
is
thy
work
thou
wert
always
good
at
thy
work
praise
god
thy
father
own
son
for
that
but
thou
dost
keep
about
like
and
take
thy
place
wi
the
lave
on
since
christmas
thou
hagged
at
times
and
folk
and
talk
about
thee
afore
long
let
talk
i
mind
their
talk
no
more
than
last
year
wind
said
harry
abruptly
but
thy
old
mother
does
she
said
looking
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
pride
and
love
and
so
harry
who
was
a
right
good
son
began
to
inquire
what
it
was
that
was
specially
weighing
on
his
mother
mind
determined
to
do
anything
in
reason
to
her
on
the
little
harmless
social
pinnacle
from
which
she
was
wont
to
look
down
on
all
the
other
mothers
and
sons
of
the
parish
he
soon
found
out
that
her
present
grievance
arose
from
his
having
neglected
his
place
as
ringer
of
the
heavy
bell
in
the
village
peal
on
the
two
preceding
sundays
and
as
this
post
was
in
some
sort
the
corresponding
one
to
stroke
of
the
boat
at
oxford
her
anxiety
was
reasonable
enough
so
harry
promised
to
go
to
ringing
in
good
time
that
morning
and
then
set
about
little
odds
and
ends
of
jobs
till
it
would
be
time
to
start
dame
winburn
went
to
her
cooking
and
other
household
duties
which
were
pretty
well
got
under
when
her
son
took
his
hat
and
started
for
the
belfry
she
stood
at
the
door
with
a
potato
in
one
hand
shading
her
eyes
with
the
other
as
she
watched
him
striding
along
the
raised
footpath
under
the
elms
when
the
sound
of
light
footsteps
and
pleasant
voices
coming
up
from
the
other
direction
made
her
turn
round
and
drop
a
curtsey
as
the
daughter
and
another
young
lady
stopped
at
her
door
good
morning
betty
said
the
former
here
a
bright
sunday
morning
at
last
is
it
is
indeed
miss
but
where
been
to
oh
we
only
been
for
a
little
walk
before
this
is
my
cousin
betty
she
has
been
at
englebourn
since
she
was
quite
a
child
so
i
been
taking
her
to
the
hawk
lynch
to
see
our
view
and
you
ca
think
how
i
have
enjoyed
it
said
her
cousin
it
is
so
still
and
beautiful
i
heer
say
as
there
ai
no
such
a
place
for
thretty
mile
round
said
betty
proudly
but
come
in
tho
and
down
a
bit
she
added
bustling
inside
her
door
and
beginning
to
rub
down
a
chair
with
her
apron
is
a
smart
step
for
gentlefolk
to
walk
afore
church
betty
notions
of
the
walking
powers
of
gentlefolk
were
very
limited
no
thank
you
we
must
be
getting
on
said
miss
winter
but
how
lovely
your
flowers
are
look
mary
did
you
ever
see
such
double
pansies
we
nothing
like
them
at
the
rectory
take
some
said
betty
emerging
again
and
beginning
to
pluck
a
handful
of
her
finest
flowers
is
all
our
doing
he
partickler
about
seeds
he
seems
to
make
everything
thrive
betty
there
that
plenty
thank
you
we
wo
take
many
for
fear
they
should
fade
before
church
is
over
oh
be
afeard
there
plenty
more
and
you
be
as
welcom
as
the
day
betty
never
said
a
truer
word
she
was
one
of
the
real
sort
who
are
found
mostly
amongst
those
who
have
the
least
to
give
they
or
anyone
else
were
welcome
to
the
best
she
had
so
the
young
ladies
took
the
flowers
thanked
her
again
and
passed
on
towards
the
the
rector
daughter
might
have
been
a
year
or
so
older
than
her
companion
she
looked
more
her
position
in
the
village
had
been
one
of
much
anxiety
and
she
was
fast
getting
an
old
head
on
young
shoulders
the
other
young
lady
was
a
slip
of
a
girl
just
coming
out
in
fact
this
was
the
first
visit
which
she
had
ever
paid
out
of
leading
strings
she
had
lived
in
a
happy
home
where
she
had
always
been
trusted
and
loved
and
perhaps
a
thought
too
much
petted
there
are
some
natures
which
attract
petting
you
ca
help
doing
your
best
to
spoil
them
in
this
way
and
it
is
satisfactory
therefore
to
know
as
the
fact
is
that
they
are
just
the
ones
which
can
not
be
so
spoilt
miss
mary
was
one
of
these
trustful
for
she
had
never
been
tricked
fearless
for
she
had
never
been
cowed
pure
and
bright
as
the
englebourn
brook
at
fifty
yards
from
its
parent
spring
in
the
chalk
for
she
had
a
pure
and
bright
nature
and
had
come
in
contact
as
yet
with
nothing
which
could
soil
or
cast
a
shadow
what
wonder
that
her
life
gave
forth
light
and
music
as
it
glided
on
and
that
every
one
who
knew
her
was
eager
to
have
her
with
them
to
warm
themselves
in
the
light
and
rejoice
in
the
music
besides
all
her
other
attractions
or
in
consequence
of
them
for
anything
i
know
she
was
one
of
the
merriest
young
women
in
the
world
always
ready
to
bubble
over
and
break
out
into
clear
laughter
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
provocation
had
not
been
wanting
during
the
last
two
days
which
she
had
spent
with
her
cousin
as
usual
she
had
brought
sunshine
with
her
and
the
old
doctor
had
half
forgotten
his
numerous
complaints
and
grievances
for
the
time
so
the
cloud
which
generally
hung
over
the
house
had
been
partially
lifted
and
mary
knowing
and
suspecting
nothing
of
the
dark
side
of
life
at
englebourn
rectory
rallied
her
cousin
on
her
gravity
and
laughed
till
she
cried
at
the
queer
ways
and
talk
of
the
people
about
the
place
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
of
dame
winburn
mary
began
well
katie
i
ca
say
that
you
have
mended
your
case
at
all
surely
you
ca
deny
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
character
in
betty
face
said
miss
winter
oh
plenty
of
character
all
your
people
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
stiffen
a
little
and
get
wrinkles
seem
to
be
full
of
character
and
i
enjoy
it
much
more
than
beauty
but
we
were
talking
about
beauty
you
know
betty
son
is
the
handsomest
young
man
in
the
parish
said
miss
winter
and
i
must
say
i
do
think
you
could
find
a
one
anywhere
then
i
ca
have
seen
him
indeed
you
have
i
pointed
him
out
to
you
at
the
post
office
yesterday
do
you
remember
he
was
waiting
for
a
letter
oh
yes
now
i
remember
well
he
was
better
than
most
but
the
faces
of
your
young
people
in
general
are
not
interesting
i
do
mean
the
children
but
the
young
men
and
women
and
they
are
awkward
and
clownish
in
their
manners
without
the
quaintness
of
the
elder
generation
who
are
the
funniest
old
dears
in
the
world
they
will
all
be
quaint
enough
as
they
get
older
you
must
remember
the
sort
of
life
they
lead
they
get
their
notions
very
slowly
and
they
must
have
notions
in
their
heads
before
they
can
show
them
on
their
faces
well
your
betty
son
looked
as
if
he
had
a
notion
of
hanging
himself
yesterday
it
no
laughing
matter
mary
i
hear
that
he
is
desperately
in
love
poor
fellow
that
makes
a
difference
of
course
i
hope
he
carry
out
his
notion
who
is
it
do
you
know
do
tell
me
all
about
it
our
gardener
daughter
i
believe
of
course
i
never
meddle
with
these
matters
but
one
ca
help
hearing
the
gossip
i
think
it
likely
to
be
true
for
he
was
about
our
premises
at
all
sorts
of
times
until
lately
and
i
never
see
him
now
that
she
is
away
is
she
pretty
said
mary
who
was
getting
interested
yes
she
is
our
belle
in
fact
they
are
the
two
beauties
of
the
parish
fancy
that
old
simon
having
a
pretty
daughter
oh
katie
look
here
who
is
this
figure
of
fun
the
figure
of
fun
was
a
man
of
small
stature
and
very
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
and
brass
buttons
and
carrying
a
great
bigger
than
himself
in
a
rough
baize
cover
he
came
out
of
a
footpath
into
the
road
just
before
them
and
on
seeing
them
touched
his
hat
to
miss
winter
and
then
fidgeted
along
with
his
load
and
jerked
his
head
in
a
deprecatory
manner
away
from
them
as
he
walked
on
with
the
sort
of
look
and
action
which
a
favorite
terrier
uses
when
his
master
holds
out
a
lighted
cigar
to
his
nose
he
was
the
village
tailor
and
constable
also
the
principal
performer
in
the
which
obtained
in
englebourn
in
the
latter
capacity
he
had
of
late
come
into
collision
with
miss
winter
for
this
was
another
of
the
questions
which
divided
the
parish
the
great
church
music
question
from
time
immemorial
at
least
ever
since
the
gallery
at
the
west
end
had
been
built
the
village
psalmody
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
occupiers
of
that
protestant
structure
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
sat
the
musicians
three
in
number
who
played
respectively
a
a
fiddle
and
a
clarionet
on
one
side
of
them
were
two
or
three
young
women
who
sang
treble
shrill
treble
with
a
strong
nasal
berkshire
drawl
in
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
musicians
sat
the
blacksmith
the
wheelwright
and
other
tradesmen
of
the
place
tradesmen
means
in
that
part
of
the
country
what
we
mean
by
artisan
and
these
were
naturally
allied
with
the
laborers
and
consorted
with
them
so
far
as
was
concerned
they
formed
a
sort
of
independent
opposition
sitting
in
the
gallery
instead
of
in
the
nave
where
the
farmers
and
the
two
or
three
principal
shopkeepers
the
great
landed
and
commercial
interests
regularly
sat
and
slept
and
where
the
two
publicans
occupied
pews
but
seldom
made
even
the
pretence
of
worshipping
the
rest
of
the
gallery
was
filled
by
the
male
peasantry
the
old
men
generally
sat
below
in
the
free
seats
the
women
also
and
some
few
boys
but
the
hearts
of
these
latter
were
in
the
gallery
a
seat
on
the
back
benches
of
which
was
a
sign
that
they
had
indued
the
and
were
thenceforth
free
from
maternal
and
pastoral
tutelage
in
the
matter
of
the
gallery
thus
constituted
had
gradually
usurped
the
psalmody
as
their
particular
and
special
portion
of
the
service
they
left
the
clerk
and
the
school
children
aided
by
such
of
the
aristocracy
below
as
cared
to
join
to
do
the
responses
but
when
singing
time
came
they
reigned
supreme
the
slate
on
which
the
psalms
were
announced
was
hung
out
from
before
the
centre
of
the
gallery
and
the
clerk
leaving
his
place
under
the
marched
up
there
to
give
them
out
he
took
this
method
of
preserving
his
constitutional
connection
with
the
singing
knowing
that
otherwise
he
could
not
have
maintained
the
rightful
position
of
his
office
in
this
matter
so
matters
had
stood
until
shortly
before
the
time
of
our
story
the
present
curate
however
backed
by
miss
winter
had
tried
a
reform
he
was
a
quiet
man
with
a
wife
and
several
children
and
small
means
he
had
served
in
the
diocese
ever
since
he
had
been
ordained
in
a
sort
of
way
going
where
he
was
sent
for
and
performing
his
routine
duties
reasonably
well
but
without
showing
any
great
aptitude
for
his
work
he
had
little
interest
and
had
almost
given
up
expecting
promotion
which
he
certainly
had
done
nothing
particular
to
merit
but
there
was
one
point
on
which
he
was
always
ready
to
go
out
of
his
way
and
take
a
little
trouble
he
was
a
good
musician
and
had
formed
choirs
at
all
his
former
curacies
soon
after
his
arrival
therefore
he
in
concert
with
miss
winter
had
begun
to
train
the
children
in
a
small
organ
which
had
stood
in
a
passage
in
the
rectory
for
many
years
had
been
repaired
and
appeared
first
at
the
schoolroom
and
at
length
under
the
gallery
of
the
church
and
it
was
announced
one
week
to
the
party
in
possession
that
on
the
next
sunday
the
constituted
authorities
would
take
the
into
their
own
hands
then
arose
a
strife
the
end
of
which
had
nearly
been
to
send
the
gallery
off
in
a
body
headed
by
the
offended
to
the
small
little
bethel
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
fortunately
the
curate
had
too
much
good
sense
to
drive
matters
to
extremities
and
so
alienate
the
parish
constable
and
a
large
part
of
his
flock
though
he
had
not
tact
or
energy
enough
to
bring
them
round
to
his
own
views
so
a
compromise
was
come
to
and
the
curate
choir
were
allowed
to
chant
the
psalms
and
canticles
which
had
always
been
read
before
while
the
gallery
remained
triumphant
masters
of
the
regular
psalms
my
readers
will
now
understand
why
miss
winter
salutation
to
the
musical
constable
was
not
so
cordial
as
it
was
to
the
other
villagers
whom
they
had
come
across
previously
indeed
miss
winter
though
she
acknowledged
the
salutation
did
not
seem
inclined
to
encourage
him
to
accompany
them
and
talk
his
mind
out
although
he
was
going
the
same
way
with
them
and
instead
of
drawing
him
out
as
was
her
wont
in
such
cases
went
on
talking
herself
to
her
cousin
the
little
man
walked
out
in
the
road
evidently
in
trouble
of
mind
he
did
not
like
to
drop
behind
or
go
ahead
without
some
further
remark
from
miss
winter
and
yet
could
not
screw
up
his
courage
to
the
point
of
opening
the
conversation
himself
so
he
ambled
on
alongside
the
footpath
on
which
they
were
walking
showing
his
discomfort
by
a
twist
of
his
neck
every
few
seconds
and
perpetual
shiftings
of
his
and
hunching
up
of
one
shoulder
the
conversation
of
the
young
ladies
under
these
circumstances
was
of
course
forced
and
miss
mary
though
infinitely
delighted
at
the
meeting
soon
began
to
pity
their
involuntary
companion
she
was
full
of
the
sensitive
instinct
which
the
best
sort
of
women
have
to
such
a
marvellous
extent
and
which
tells
them
at
once
and
infallibly
if
any
one
in
their
company
has
even
a
creased
next
their
moral
skin
before
they
had
walked
a
hundred
yards
she
was
interceding
for
the
rebellious
constable
katie
she
said
softly
in
french
do
speak
to
him
the
poor
man
is
frightfully
uncomfortable
it
serves
him
right
answered
miss
winter
in
the
same
language
you
do
know
how
impertinent
he
was
the
other
day
to
walker
and
he
wo
give
way
on
the
least
point
and
leads
the
rest
of
the
old
singers
and
makes
them
as
stubborn
as
himself
but
look
how
he
is
winking
and
jerking
his
head
at
you
you
really
must
be
so
cruel
to
him
katie
i
shall
have
to
begin
talking
to
him
if
you
do
thus
urged
miss
winter
opened
the
conversation
by
asking
after
his
wife
and
when
she
had
ascertained
that
his
missus
wur
pretty
middlin
made
some
other
commonplace
remark
and
relapsed
into
silence
by
the
help
of
mary
however
a
sort
of
disjointed
dialogue
was
kept
up
till
they
came
to
the
gate
which
led
up
to
the
school
into
which
the
children
were
trooping
by
twos
and
threes
here
the
ladies
turned
in
and
were
going
up
the
walk
towards
the
school
door
when
the
constable
summoned
up
courage
to
speak
on
the
matter
which
was
troubling
him
and
resting
the
carefully
on
his
right
foot
calling
out
after
them
oh
please
marm
miss
winter
well
she
said
quietly
turning
round
what
do
you
wish
to
say
why
please
mann
i
hopes
as
you
do
think
i
be
any
ways
unked
this
here
quire
singin
as
they
calls
it
i
sartin
you
knows
as
there
ai
amost
nothing
i
would
do
to
please
ee
well
you
know
how
to
do
it
very
easily
she
said
when
he
paused
i
do
ask
you
even
to
give
up
your
music
and
try
to
work
with
us
though
i
think
you
might
have
done
that
i
only
ask
you
to
use
some
psalms
and
tunes
which
are
fit
to
be
used
in
a
church
to
be
sure
us
ool
we
as
wants
no
tunes
them
as
we
sings
be
aal
owld
ones
as
ha
been
used
in
our
church
ever
since
i
can
mind
but
you
only
choose
thaay
as
you
likes
out
the
book
and
we
be
ready
to
kep
to
thaay
i
think
walker
made
a
selection
for

some
weeks
ago
said
miss
winter
did
he
not
but
is
narra
mossel
o
use

to
try
his
and
sich
like
i
hopes
you
wu
be
offended
wi
me
miss
for
i
be
telling
nought
but
truth
he
spoke
louder
as
they
got
nearer
to
the
school
door
and
as
they
were
opening
it
shouted
his
last
shot
after
them
is
na
good
to
try
thaay
tunes
o
miss
when
us
praises
god
us
likes
to
praise
un
joyful
there
you
hear
that
mary
said
miss
winter
you
soon
begin
to
see
why
i
look
grave
there
never
was
such
a
hard
parish
to
manage
nobody
will
do
what
they
ought
i
never
can
get
them
to
do
anything
perhaps
we
may
manage
to
teach
the
children
better
that
my
only
comfort
but
katie
dear
what
the
poor
things
sing
psalms
i
hope
oh
yes
but
they
choose
all
the
odd
ones
on
purpose
i
believe
which
class
will
you
take
and
so
the
young
ladies
settled
to
their
teaching
and
the
children
in
her
class
all
fell
in
love
with
mary
before
the
proceeded
to
the
church
and
did
the
usual
rehearsals
and
gossiped
with
the
sexton
to
whom
he
confided
the
fact
that
the
young
missus
was
terrible
vexed
the
bells
soon
began
to
ring
and
widow
winburn
heart
was
glad
as
she
listened
to
the
full
peal
and
thought
to
herself
that
it
was
her
harry
who
was
making
so
much
noise
in
the
world
and
speaking
to
all
the
neighborhood
then
the
peal
ceased
as
drew
near
and
the
single
bell
began
and
the
congregation
came
flocking
in
from
all
sides
the
farmers
letting
their
wives
and
children
enter
gathered
round
the
church
porch
and
compared
notes
in
a
ponderous
manner
on
crops
and
markets
the
labourers
collected
near
the
door
by
which
the
gallery
was
reached
all
the
men
of
the
parish
seemed
to
like
standing
about
before
church
until
they
had
seen
the
clergyman
safely
inside
he
came
up
with
the
school
children
and
the
young
ladies
and
in
due
course
the
bell
stopped
and
the
service
began
there
was
a
very
good
congregation
still
at
englebourn
the
adult
generation
had
been
bred
up
in
times
when
every
decent
person
in
the
parish
went
to
church
and
the
custom
was
still
strong
notwithstanding
the
rector
bad
example
he
scarcely
ever
came
to
church
himself
in
the
mornings
though
his
wheelchair
might
be
seen
going
up
and
down
on
the
gravel
before
his
house
or
on
the
lawn
on
warm
days
and
this
was
one
of
his
daughter
greatest
troubles
the
little
choir
of
children
sang
admirably
led
by
the
schoolmistress
and
miss
winter
and
the
curate
exchanged
approving
glances
they
performed
the
liveliest
chant
in
their
collection
that
the
opposition
might
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
their
want
of
joyfulness
and
in
turn
miss
winter
was
in
hopes
that
out
of
deference
to
her
the
usual
rule
of
selection
in
the
gallery
might
have
been
modified
it
was
with
no
small
annoyance
therefore
that
after
the
litany
was
over
and
the
tuning
finished
she
heard
the
clerk
give
out
that
they
would
praise
god
by
singing
part
of
the
psalm
mary
who
was
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
as
to
what
was
coming
saw
the
curate
give
a
slight
shrug
with
his
shoulders
and
lift
of
his
eyebrows
as
he
left
the
and
in
another
minute
it
became
a
painful
effort
for
her
to
keep
from
laughing
as
she
slyly
watched
her
cousin
face
while
the
gallery
sang
with
vigour
worthy
of
any
cause
or
occasion
on
the
old
lion
he
shall
go
the
adder
fell
and
long
on
the
young
lion
tread
also
with
dragons
stout
and
strong
the
trebles
took
up
the
last
line
and
repeated
with
dragons
stout
and
strong
and
then
the
whole
strength
of
the
gallery
chorused
again
with
stout
and
strong
and
the
seemed
to
her
to
prolong
the
notes
and
to
gloat
over
them
as
he
droned
them
out
looking
triumphantly
at
the
distant
curate
mary
was
thankful
to
kneel
down
to
compose
her
face
the
first
trial
was
the
severe
one
and
she
got
through
the
second
psalm
much
better
and
by
the
time
walker
had
plunged
fairly
into
his
sermon
she
was
a
model
of
propriety
and
sedateness
again
but
it
was
to
be
a
sunday
of
adventures
the
sermon
had
scarcely
begun
when
there
was
a
stir
down
by
the
door
at
the
west
end
and
people
began
to
look
round
and
whisper
presently
a
man
came
softly
up
and
said
something
to
the
clerk
the
clerk
jumped
up
and
whispered
to
the
curate
who
paused
for
a
moment
with
a
puzzled
look
and
instead
of
finishing
his
sentence
said
in
a
loud
voice
farmer
groves
house
is
on
fire
the
curate
probably
anticipated
the
effect
of
his
words
in
a
minute
he
was
the
only
person
left
in
the
church
except
the
clerk
and
one
or
two
very
infirm
old
folk
he
shut
up
and
pocketed
his
sermon
and
followed
his
flock
it
proved
luckily
to
be
only
farmer
groves
chimney
and
not
his
house
which
was
on
fire
the
farmhouse
was
only
two
fields
from
the
village
and
the
congregation
rushed
across
there
harry
winburn
and
two
or
three
of
the
most
active
young
men
and
boys
leading
as
they
entered
the
yard
the
flames
were
rushing
out
of
the
chimney
and
any
moment
the
thatch
might
take
fire
here
was
the
real
danger
a
ladder
had
just
been
raised
against
the
chimney
and
while
a
frightened
and
a
held
it
at
the
bottom
a
man
was
going
up
it
carrying
a
bucket
of
water
it
shook
with
his
weight
and
the
top
was
slipping
gradually
along
the
face
of
the
chimney
and
in
another
moment
would
rest
against
nothing
harry
and
his
companions
saw
the
danger
at
a
glance
and
shouted
to
the
man
to
stand
still
till
they
could
get
to
the
ladder
they
rushed
towards
him
with
the
rush
which
men
can
only
make
under
strong
excitement
the
foremost
of
them
caught
a
spoke
with
one
hand
but
before
he
could
steady
it
the
top
slipped
clear
of
the
chimney
and
ladder
man
and
bucket
came
heavily
to
the
ground
then
came
a
scene
of
bewildering
confusion
as
women
and
children
trooped
into
the
yard
who
was
it
was
he
dead
the
fire
was
catching
the
thatch
the
stables
were
on
fire
who
did
it
all
sorts
of
cries
and
all
sorts
of
acts
except
the
right
ones
fortunately
two
or
three
of
the
men
with
heads
on
their
shoulders
soon
organized
a
line
for
handling
buckets
the
flue
was
stopped
below
and
harry
winburn
standing
nearly
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
which
was
now
safely
planted
was
deluging
the
thatch
round
the
chimney
from
the
buckets
handed
up
to
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
able
to
pour
water
down
the
chimney
itself
and
soon
afterwards
the
whole
affair
was
at
an
end
the
dinner
was
spoilt
but
otherwise
no
damage
had
been
done
except
to
the
clothes
of
the
foremost
men
and
the
only
accident
was
that
first
fall
from
the
ladder
the
man
had
been
carried
out
of
the
yard
while
the
fire
was
still
burning
so
that
it
was
hardly
known
who
it
was
now
in
answer
to
their
inquiries
it
proved
to
be
old
simon
the
rector
gardener
and
head
man
who
had
seen
the
fire
and
sent
the
news
to
the
church
while
he
himself
went
to
the
spot
with
such
result
as
we
have
seen
the
surgeon
had
not
yet
seen
him
some
declared
he
was
dead
others
that
he
was
sitting
up
at
home
and
quite
well
little
by
little
the
crowd
dispersed
to
sunday
dinners
when
they
met
again
before
the
afternoon
service
it
was
ascertained
that
simon
was
certainly
not
dead
but
all
else
was
still
nothing
more
than
rumor
public
opinion
was
much
divided
some
holding
that
it
would
go
hard
with
a
man
of
his
age
and
heft
but
the
common
belief
seemed
to
be
that
he
was
of
that
sort
as
take
a
deal
killin
and
that
he
would
be
none
the
worse
for
such
a
fall
as
that
the
two
young
ladies
had
been
much
shocked
at
the
accident
and
had
accompanied
the
hurdle
on
which
old
simon
was
carried
to
his
cottage
door
after
afternoon
service
they
went
round
by
the
cottage
to
inquire
the
two
girls
knocked
at
the
door
which
was
opened
by
his
wife
who
dropped
a
curtsey
and
smoothed
down
her
sunday
apron
when
she
found
who
were
her
visitors
she
seemed
at
first
a
little
unwilling
to
let
them
in
but
miss
winter
pressed
so
kindly
to
see
her
husband
and
mary
made
such
sympathizing
eyes
at
her
that
the
old
woman
gave
in
and
conducted
them
through
the
front
room
into
that
beyond
where
the
patient
lay
i
hope
as
you
excuse
it
miss
for
i
knows
the
place
do
smell
terrible
bad
of
baccer
only
my
old
man
he
said
as
oh
never
mind
we
do
care
at
all
about
the
smell
poor
simon
i
sure
if
it
does
him
any
good
or
soothes
the
pain
i
shall
be
glad
to
buy
him
some
tobacco
myself
the
old
man
was
lying
on
the
bed
with
his
coat
and
boots
off
and
a
worsted
nightcap
of
his
wife
knitting
pulled
on
to
his
head
she
had
tried
hard
to
get
him
to
go
to
bed
at
once
and
take
some
physic
and
his
present
costume
and
position
was
the
compromise
his
back
was
turned
to
them
as
they
entered
and
he
was
evidently
in
pain
for
he
drew
his
breath
heavily
and
with
difficulty
and
gave
a
sort
of
groan
at
every
respiration
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
their
entrance
so
his
wife
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
simon
here
the
young
ladies
come
to
see
how
you
be
simon
turned
himself
round
and
winced
and
groaned
as
he
pulled
off
his
nightcap
in
token
of
respect
we
did
like
to
go
home
without
coming
to
see
how
you
were
simon
has
the
doctor
been
oh
yes
miss
he
a
been
and

his

the
gardener

simon

quite
quiet
for
a
week
at
least
till

rid
of
this
pain
so

the
wife

what
the
young
missus

days
back
and
her
never

gurt
while
arter
her
time
she
will
do
very
well
i
dare
say
said
miss
winter
one
of
the
men
can
look
after
her
the
notion
of
anyone
else
attending
tiny
in
her
interesting
situation
seemed
to
excite
simon
beyond
bearing
for
he
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
and
was
about
to
make
a
demonstration
with
his
other
hand
when
the
pain
seized
him
again
and
he
sank
back
groaning
there
you
see
simon
you
ca
move
without
pain
you
must
be
quiet
till
you
have
seen
the
doctor
again
there
the
red
spider
out
along
the
south
wall
ugh
ugh
persisted
simon
without
seeming
to
hear
her
and
your
new
covered
wi
blight
i
wur
a
tacklin
one
of
just
afore
you
cum
in
following
the
direction
indicated
by
his
nod
the
girls
became
aware
of
a
plant
by
his
bedside
which
he
had
been
fumigating
for
his
pipe
was
leaning
against
the
in
which
it
stood
he
would
lie
still
nohow
miss
explained
his
wife
till
i
went
and
fetched
un
in
a
pipe
and
one
o
thaay
plants
from
the
greenhouse
it
was
very
thoughtful
of
you
simon
said
miss
winter
you
know
how
much
i
prize
these
new
plants
but
we
will
manage
them
and
you
must
think
of
these
things
now
you
have
had
a
wonderful
escape
for
a
man
of
your
age
i
hope
we
shall
find
that
there
is
nothing
much
the
matter
with
you
after
a
few
days
but
you
might
have
been
killed
you
know
you
ought
to
be
very
thankful
to
god
that
you
were
not
killed
in
that
fall
so
i
be
miss
werry
thankful
to
un
ugh
ugh
and
if
it
please
the
lord
to
spare
my
life
till
mornin
ugh
ugh
we
smoke
them
cussed
insects
this
last
retort
of
the
incorrigible
simon
on
her
attempt
as
the
rector
daughter
to
improve
the
occasion
was
too
much
for
miss
mary
and
she
slipped
out
of
the
room
lest
she
should
bring
disgrace
on
herself
by
an
explosion
of
laughter
she
was
joined
by
her
cousin
in
another
minute
and
the
two
walked
together
toward
the
rectory
i
hope
you
were
not
faint
dear
with
that
close
room
smelling
of
smoke
oh
dear
no
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
only
afraid
of
laughing
at
your
quaint
old
patient
what
a
rugged
old
dear
he
is
i
hope
he
is
much
hurt
i
hope
not
indeed
for
he
is
the
most
honest
faithful
old
servant
in
the
world
but
so
obstinate
he
never
will
go
to
church
on
sunday
mornings
and
when
i
speak
to
him
about
it
he
says
papa
does
go
which
is
very
wrong
and
impertinent
of
him
chapter
xix
a
promise
of
fairer
weather
all
dwellers
in
and
about
london
are
alas
too
well
acquainted
with
the
change
which
we
have
to
undergo
once
at
least
in
every
spring
as
each
succeeding
winter
wears
away
the
same
thing
happens
to
us
for
some
time
we
do
not
trust
the
fair
lengthening
days
and
can
not
believe
that
the
dirty
pair
of
sparrows
who
live
opposite
our
window
are
really
making
love
and
going
to
build
notwithstanding
all
their
twittering
but
morning
after
morning
rises
fresh
and
gentle
there
is
no
longer
any
voice
in
the
air
we
drop
our
we
rejoice
in
the
green
shoots
which
the
privet
hedge
is
making
in
the
square
garden
and
hail
the
returning
leaves
of
the
as
friends
we
go
out
of
our
way
to
walk
through
covent
garden
market
to
see
the
show
of
flowers
from
the
happy
country
this
state
of
things
goes
on
sometimes
for
a
few
days
only
sometimes
for
weeks
till
we
make
sure
that
we
are
safe
for
this
spring
at
any
rate
do
we
wish
we
may
get
it
sooner
or
later
but
sure
sure
as
christmas
bills
or
the
or
anything
if
there
be
anything
surer
than
these
comes
the
morning
when
we
are
suddenly
conscious
as
soon
as
we
rise
that
there
is
something
the
matter
we
do
not
feel
comfortable
in
our
clothes
nothing
tastes
quite
as
it
should
at
breakfast
though
the
day
looks
bright
enough
there
is
a
fierce
dusty
taste
about
it
as
we
look
out
through
windows
which
no
instinct
now
prompts
us
to
throw
open
as
it
has
done
every
day
for
the
last
month
but
it
is
only
when
we
open
our
doors
and
issue
into
the
street
that
the
hateful
reality
comes
right
home
to
us
all
moisture
and
softness
and
pleasantness
has
gone
clean
out
of
the
air
since
last
night
we
seem
to
inhale
yards
of
horse
hair
instead
of
satin
our
skins
dry
up
our
eyes
and
hair
and
whiskers
and
clothes
are
soon
filled
with
loathsome
dust
and
our
nostrils
with
the
reek
of
the
great
city
we
glance
at
the
on
the
nearest
steeple
and
see
that
it
points
and
so
long
as
the
change
lasts
we
carry
about
with
us
a
feeling
of
anger
and
impatience
as
though
we
personally
were
being
we
could
have
borne
with
it
well
enough
in
november
it
would
have
been
natural
and
all
in
the
days
work
in
march
but
now
when
rotten
row
is
beginning
to
be
crowded
when
long
lines
of
pleasure
vans
are
leaving
town
on
monday
mornings
for
hampton
court
or
the
poor
remains
of
dear
epping
forest
when
the
exhibitions
are
open
or
about
to
open
when
the
religious
public
is
up
or
on
its
way
up
for
may
meetings
when
the
thames
is
already
sending
up
faint
warnings
of
what
we
may
expect
as
soon
as
his
dirty
old
life
blood
shall
have
been
thoroughly
warmed
up
and
the
ship
and
trafalgar
and
the
star
and
garter
are
in
full
swing
at
the
antagonistic
poles
of
the
cockney
system
we
do
feel
that
this
blight
which
has
come
over
us
and
everything
is
an
insult
and
that
while
it
lasts
as
there
is
nobody
who
can
be
made
particularly
responsible
for
it
we
are
justified
in
going
about
in
general
disgust
and
ready
to
quarrel
with
anybody
we
may
meet
on
the
smallest
pretext
this
sort
of
state
is
perhaps
the
best
physical
analogy
for
that
mental
one
in
which
our
hero
now
found
himself
the
real
crises
was
over
he
had
managed
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
the
storm
and
drift
for
the
present
at
least
into
the
skirts
of
it
where
he
lay
rolling
under
bare
poles
comparatively
safe
but
without
any
power
as
yet
to
get
the
ship
well
in
hand
and
make
her
obey
her
helm
the
storm
might
break
over
him
again
at
any
minute
and
would
find
him
almost
as
helpless
as
ever
for
he
could
not
follow
drysdale
advice
at
once
and
break
off
his
visits
to
the
choughs
altogether
he
went
back
again
after
a
day
or
two
but
only
for
short
visits
he
never
stayed
behind
now
after
the
other
men
left
the
bar
and
avoided
interviews
with
patty
alone
as
diligently
as
he
had
sought
them
before
she
was
puzzled
at
his
change
of
manner
and
not
being
able
to
account
for
it
was
piqued
and
ready
to
revenge
herself
and
pay
him
out
in
the
hundred
little
ways
which
the
least
practiced
of
her
sex
know
how
to
employ
for
the
discipline
of
any
of
the
inferior
or
trousered
half
of
the
creation
if
she
had
been
really
in
love
with
him
it
would
have
been
a
different
matter
but
she
was
not
in
the
last
six
weeks
she
had
certainly
often
had
visions
of
the
pleasures
of
being
a
lady
and
keeping
servants
and
riding
in
a
carriage
like
the
squires
and
rectors
wives
and
daughters
about
her
home
she
had
a
liking
even
a
sentiment
for
him
which
might
very
well
have
grown
into
something
dangerous
before
long
but
as
yet
it
was
not
more
than
skin
deep
of
late
indeed
she
had
been
much
more
frightened
than
attracted
by
the
conduct
of
her
admirer
and
really
felt
it
a
relief
notwithstanding
her
pique
when
he
retired
into
the
elder
brother
sort
of
state
but
she
would
have
been
more
than
woman
if
she
had
not
resented
the
change
and
so
very
soon
the
pangs
of
jealousy
were
added
to
his
other
troubles
other
men
were
beginning
to
frequent
the
choughs
regularly
drysdale
besides
dividing
with
tom
the
prestige
of
being
an
original
discoverer
was
by
far
the
largest
customer
st
cloud
came
and
brought
chanter
with
him
to
whom
patty
was
actually
civil
not
because
she
liked
him
at
all
but
because
she
saw
that
it
made
tom
furious
though
he
could
not
fix
on
any
one
man
in
particular
he
felt
that
mankind
in
general
were
gaining
on
him
in
his
better
moments
indeed
he
often
wished
that
she
would
take
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
and
throw
him
over
for
good
and
all
but
keep
away
from
the
place
altogether
he
could
not
and
often
when
he
fancied
himself
on
the
point
of
doing
it
a
pretty
toss
of
her
head
or
a
kind
look
of
her
eyes
would
scatter
all
his
good
resolutions
to
the
four
winds
and
so
the
days
dragged
on
and
he
dragged
on
through
them
hot
fits
of
conceit
alternating
in
him
with
cold
fits
of
despondency
and
mawkishness
and
discontent
with
everything
and
everybody
which
were
all
the
more
intolerable
from
their
entire
strangeness
instead
of
seeing
the
bright
side
of
all
things
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
creation
through
yellow
spectacles
and
saw
faults
and
blemishes
in
all
his
acquaintance
which
had
been
till
now
invisible
but
the
more
he
was
inclined
to
depreciate
all
other
men
the
more
he
felt
there
was
one
to
whom
he
had
been
grossly
unjust
and
as
he
recalled
all
that
had
passed
he
began
to
do
justice
to
the
man
who
had
not
flinched
from
warning
him
and
braving
him
who
he
felt
had
been
watching
over
him
and
trying
to
guide
him
straight
when
he
had
lost
all
power
or
will
to
keep
straight
himself
from
this
time
the
dread
increased
on
him
lest
any
of
the
other
men
should
find
out
his
quarrel
with
hardy
their
utter
ignorance
of
it
encouraged
him
in
the
hope
that
it
might
all
pass
off
like
a
bad
dream
while
it
remained
a
matter
between
them
alone
he
felt
that
all
might
come
straight
though
he
could
not
think
how
he
began
to
loiter
by
the
entrance
of
the
passage
which
led
to
hardy
rooms
sometimes
he
would
find
something
to
say
to
his
scout
or
which
took
him
into
the
back
outside
window
glancing
at
it
sideways
as
he
stood
giving
his
orders
there
it
was
wide
open
generally
he
hardly
knew
whether
he
hoped
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
owner
but
he
did
hope
that
hardy
might
hear
his
voice
he
watched
him
in
chapel
and
hall
furtively
but
constantly
and
was
always
fancying
what
he
was
doing
and
thinking
about
was
it
as
painful
an
effort
to
hardy
he
wondered
as
to
him
to
go
on
speaking
as
if
nothing
had
happened
when
they
met
at
the
boats
as
they
did
now
again
almost
daily
for
diogenes
was
bent
on
training
some
of
the
torpids
for
next
year
and
yet
never
to
look
one
another
in
the
face
to
live
together
as
usual
during
part
of
every
day
and
yet
to
feel
all
the
time
that
a
great
wall
had
risen
between
them
more
hopelessly
dividing
them
for
the
time
than
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
or
continent
amongst
other
distractions
which
tom
tried
at
this
crisis
of
his
life
was
reading
for
three
or
four
days
running
he
really
worked
hard
very
hard
if
we
were
to
reckon
by
the
number
of
hours
he
spent
in
his
own
rooms
over
his
books
with
his
oak
sported
hard
even
though
we
should
only
reckon
by
results
for
though
scarcely
an
hour
passed
that
he
was
not
balancing
on
the
hind
legs
of
his
chair
with
a
vacant
look
in
his
eyes
and
thinking
of
anything
but
greek
roots
or
latin
constructions
yet
on
the
whole
he
managed
to
get
through
a
good
deal
and
one
evening
for
the
first
time
since
his
quarrel
with
hardy
felt
a
sensation
of
real
comfort
it
hardly
amounted
to
pleasure
as
he
closed
his
sophocles
some
hour
or
so
after
hall
having
just
finished
the
last
of
the
greek
plays
which
he
meant
to
take
in
for
his
first
examination
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
sat
for
a
few
minutes
letting
his
thoughts
follow
their
own
bent
they
soon
took
to
going
wrong
and
he
jumped
up
in
fear
lest
he
should
be
drifting
back
into
the
black
stormy
sea
in
the
trough
of
which
he
had
been
laboring
so
lately
and
which
he
felt
he
was
by
no
means
clear
of
yet
at
first
he
caught
up
his
cap
and
gown
as
though
he
were
going
out
there
was
a
wine
party
at
one
of
his
acquaintance
rooms
or
he
could
go
and
smoke
a
cigar
in
the
pool
room
or
at
any
one
of
a
dozen
other
places
on
second
thoughts
however
he
threw
his
academicals
back
on
to
the
sofa
and
went
to
his
the
reading
had
paid
so
well
that
evening
that
he
resolved
to
go
on
with
it
he
had
no
particular
object
in
selecting
one
book
more
than
another
and
so
took
down
carelessly
the
first
that
came
to
hand
it
happened
to
be
a
volume
of
plato
and
opened
of
its
own
accord
at
the
apology
he
glanced
at
a
few
lines
what
a
flood
of
memories
they
called
up
this
was
almost
the
last
book
he
had
read
at
school
and
teacher
and
friends
and
lofty
library
stood
out
before
him
at
once
then
the
blunders
that
he
himself
and
others
had
made
rushed
through
his
mind
and
he
almost
burst
into
a
laugh
as
he
wheeled
his
chair
round
to
the
window
and
began
reading
where
he
had
opened
encouraging
every
thought
of
the
old
times
when
he
first
read
that
marvellous
defense
and
throwing
himself
back
into
them
with
all
his
might
and
still
as
he
read
forgotten
words
of
wise
comment
and
strange
thoughts
of
wonder
and
longing
came
back
to
him
the
great
truth
which
he
had
been
led
to
the
brink
of
in
those
early
days
rose
in
all
its
awe
and
all
its
attractiveness
before
him
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
gave
himself
up
to
his
thought
and
how
strangely
that
thought
bore
on
the
struggle
which
had
been
raging
in
him
of
late
how
an
answer
seemed
to
be
trembling
to
come
out
of
it
to
all
the
cries
now
defiant
now
plaintive
which
had
gone
up
out
of
his
heart
in
this
time
of
trouble
for
his
thought
was
of
that
spirit
distinct
from
himself
and
yet
communing
with
his
inmost
soul
always
dwelling
in
him
knowing
him
better
than
he
knew
himself
never
misleading
him
always
leading
him
to
light
and
truth
of
which
the
old
philosopher
spoke
the
old
heathen
socrates
did
actually
believe
that
there
can
be
no
question
about
it
he
thought
has
not
the
testimony
of
the
best
men
through
these
two
thousand
years
borne
witness
that
he
was
right
that
he
did
not
believe
a
lie
that
was
what
we
were
told
surely
i
do
mistake
were
we
not
told
too
or
did
i
dream
it
that
what
was
true
for
him
was
true
for
every
man
for
me
that
there
is
a
spirit
dwelling
in
me
striving
with
me
ready
to
lead
me
into
all
truth
if
i
will
submit
to
his
guidance
ay
submit
submit
there
the
rub
give
yourself
up
to
his
guidance
throw
up
the
reins
and
say
you
made
a
mess
of
it
well
why
not
have
i
made
a
mess
of
it
am
i
fit
to
hold
the
reins
not
i
he
got
up
and
began
walking
about
his
rooms
i
give
it
up
give
it
up
he
went
on
presently
yes
but
to
whom
not
to
the
daemon
spirit
whatever
it
was
who
took
up
abode
in
the
old
athenian
at
least
so
he
said
and
so
i
believe
no
no
two
thousand
years
and
all
that
they
have
seen
have
not
passed
over
the
world
to
leave
us
just
where
he
was
left
we
want
no
daemons
or
spirits
and
yet
the
old
heathen
was
guided
right
and
what
can
a
man
want
more
and
who
ever
wanted
guidance
more
than
i
now
here
in
this
room
at
this
minute
i
give
up
the
reins
who
will
take
them
and
so
there
came
on
him
one
of
those
seasons
when
a
man
thoughts
can
not
be
followed
in
words
a
sense
of
awe
came
on
him
and
over
him
and
wrapped
him
round
awe
at
a
presence
of
which
he
was
becoming
suddenly
conscious
into
which
he
seemed
to
have
wandered
and
yet
which
he
felt
must
have
been
there
around
him
in
his
own
heart
and
soul
though
he
knew
it
not
there
was
hope
and
longing
in
his
heart
mingling
with
the
fear
of
that
presence
but
withal
the
old
reckless
and
daring
feeling
which
he
knew
so
well
still
bubbling
up
untamed
untamable
it
seemed
to
him
the
room
stifled
him
now
so
he
threw
on
his
cap
and
gown
and
hurried
down
into
the
quadrangle
it
was
very
quiet
probably
there
was
not
a
dozen
men
in
college
he
walked
across
to
the
low
dark
entrance
of
the
passage
which
led
to
hardy
rooms
and
there
paused
was
he
there
by
chance
or
was
he
guided
there
yes
this
was
the
right
way
for
him
he
had
no
doubt
now
as
to
that
down
the
dark
passage
and
into
the
room
he
knew
so
well
and
what
then
he
took
a
short
turn
or
two
before
the
entrance
how
could
he
be
sure
that
hardy
was
alone
and
if
not
to
go
in
would
be
worse
than
useless
if
he
were
alone
what
should
he
say
after
all
he
go
in
there
was
there
no
way
but
that
the
college
clock
struck
a
quarter
to
seven
it
was
his
usual
time
for
the
choughs
the
house
would
be
quiet
now
was
there
not
one
looking
out
for
him
there
who
would
be
grieved
if
he
did
not
come
after
all
might
not
that
be
his
way
for
this
night
at
least
he
might
bring
pleasure
to
one
human
being
by
going
there
at
once
that
he
knew
what
else
could
he
be
sure
of
at
this
moment
he
heard
hardy
door
open
and
a
voice
saying
and
the
next
grey
came
out
of
the
passage
and
was
passing
close
to
him
join
yourself
to
him
the
impulse
came
so
strongly
into
mind
this
time
that
it
was
like
a
voice
speaking
him
he
yielded
to
it
and
stepping
to
grey
side
wished
him
the
other
returned
his
salute
in
his
shy
way
and
was
hurrying
on
but
tom
kept
by
him
have
you
been
reading
with
hardy
yes
how
is
he
i
have
not
seen
anything
of
him
for
some
time
oh
very
well
i
think
said
grey
glancing
sideways
at
his
questioner
and
adding
after
a
moment
i
have
wondered
rather
not
to
see
you
there
of
late
are
you
going
to
your
school
said
tom
breaking
away
from
the
subject
yes
and
i
am
rather
late
i
must
make
haste
on
good
night
will
you
let
me
go
with
you
it
would
be
a
real
kindness
indeed
he
added
as
he
saw
how
embarrassing
his
proposal
was
to
grey
i
will
do
whatever
you
tell
me
you
know
how
grateful
i
should
be
to
you
do
let
me
go
just
for
try
me
once
grey
hesitated
turned
his
head
sharply
once
or
twice
as
they
walked
on
together
and
then
said
with
something
like
a
sigh
i
do
know
i
sure
did
you
ever
teach
in
a
night
school
no
but
i
have
taught
in
the
at
home
sometimes
indeed
i
will
do
whatever
you
tell
me
oh
but
this
is
not
at
all
like
a
they
are
a
very
rough
wild
lot
the
rougher
the
better
said
tom
i
shall
know
how
to
manage
them
then
but
you
must
not
really
be
rough
with
them
no
i
wo
i
did
mean
that
said
tom
hastily
for
he
saw
his
mistake
at
once
i
shall
take
it
as
a
great
favor
if
you
will
let
me
go
with
you
you
wo
repent
it
i
sure
grey
did
not
seem
at
all
sure
of
this
but
saw
no
means
of
getting
rid
of
his
companion
and
so
they
walked
on
together
and
turned
down
a
long
narrow
court
in
the
lowest
part
of
the
town
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
laboring
men
mostly
irish
lounged
or
stood
about
smoking
and
talking
to
one
another
or
to
the
women
who
leant
out
of
the
windows
or
passed
to
and
fro
on
their
various
errands
of
business
or
pleasure
a
group
of
lads
were
playing
at
at
the
farther
end
and
all
over
the
court
were
scattered
children
of
all
ages
ragged
and
noisy
little
creatures
most
of
them
on
whom
paternal
and
maternal
admonitions
and
cuffs
were
constantly
being
expended
and
to
all
appearances
in
vain
at
the
sight
of
grey
a
shout
arose
amongst
the
smaller
boys
of
here
the
teacher
and
they
crowded
around
him
and
tom
as
they
went
up
the
court
several
of
the
men
gave
him
a
nod
as
he
passed
along
wishing
them
good
evening
the
rest
merely
stared
at
him
and
his
companion
they
stopped
at
a
door
which
grey
opened
and
led
the
way
into
the
passage
of
an
old
cottage
on
the
ground
floor
of
which
were
two
low
rooms
which
served
for
the
a
woman
who
kept
the
house
was
waiting
and
said
to
grey
jones
told
me
to
say
sir
he
would
not
be
here
to
night
as
he
has
got
a
bad
fever
case
so
you
was
to
take
only
the
lower
classes
sir
he
said
and
the
policeman
would
be
near
to
keep
out
the
big
boys
if
you
wanted
him
shall
i
go
and
tell
him
to
step
round
sir
grey
looked
embarrassed
for
a
moment
and
then
said
no
never
mind
you
can
go
and
then
turning
to
tom
added
jones
is
the
curate
he
wo
be
here
and
some
of
the
bigger
boys
are
very
noisy
and
troublesome
and
only
come
to
make
a
noise
however
if
they
come
we
must
do
our
best
meantime
the
crowd
of
small
ragged
urchins
had
filled
the
room
and
were
swarming
on
to
the
benches
and
squabbling
for
the
which
were
laid
out
on
the
thin
desks
grey
set
to
work
to
get
them
into
order
and
soon
the
smallest
were
draughted
off
into
the
inner
room
with
slates
and
and
the
bigger
ones
some
dozen
in
number
settled
to
their
writing
tom
seconded
him
so
readily
and
seemed
so
much
at
home
that
grey
felt
quite
relieved
you
seem
to
get
on
capitally
he
said
i
will
go
into
the
inner
room
to
the
little
ones
and
you
stay
and
take
these
there
are
the
when
they
have
done
their
copies
and
so
went
off
into
the
inner
room
and
closed
the
door
tom
set
himself
to
work
with
a
will
and
as
he
bent
over
one
after
another
of
the
pupils
and
guided
the
small
grubby
hands
which
clutched
the
inky
pens
with
cramped
fingers
and
went
spluttering
and
blotching
along
the
lines
of
the
felt
the
yellow
scales
dropping
from
his
eyes
and
more
warmth
coming
back
into
his
heart
than
he
had
known
there
for
many
a
day
all
went
on
well
inside
notwithstanding
a
few
small
between
the
scholars
but
every
now
and
then
mud
was
thrown
against
the
window
and
noises
outside
and
in
the
passages
threatened
some
interruption
at
last
when
the
writing
was
finished
the
cleared
away
and
the
distributed
the
door
opened
and
two
or
three
big
boys
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
lounged
in
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
their
caps
on
there
was
an
insolent
look
about
them
which
set
tom
back
up
at
once
however
he
kept
his
temper
made
them
take
their
caps
off
and
as
they
said
they
wanted
to
read
with
the
rest
let
them
take
their
places
on
the
benches
but
now
came
the
tug
of
war
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
on
the
whole
lot
at
once
and
no
sooner
did
he
fix
his
attention
on
the
stammering
reader
for
the
time
being
and
try
to
help
him
than
anarchy
broke
out
all
round
him
small
stones
and
shot
were
thrown
about
and
cries
arose
from
the
smaller
fry
please
sir
he
been
and
poured
some
ink
down
my
back
he
stole
my
book
sir
he
gone
and
stuck
a
pin
in
my
leg
the
were
so
cunning
that
it
was
impossible
to
catch
them
but
as
he
was
hastily
turning
in
his
own
mind
what
to
do
a
cry
arose
and
one
of
the
benches
went
suddenly
over
backwards
on
to
the
floor
carrying
with
it
its
whole
freight
of
boys
except
two
of
the
bigger
ones
who
were
the
evident
authors
of
the
mishap
tom
sprang
at
the
one
nearest
him
seized
him
by
the
collar
hauled
him
into
the
passage
and
sent
him
out
of
the
with
a
sound
kick
and
then
rushing
back
caught
hold
of
the
second
who
went
down
on
his
back
and
clung
round
tom
legs
shouting
for
help
to
his
remaining
companions
and
struggling
and
swearing
it
was
all
the
work
of
a
moment
and
now
the
door
opened
and
grey
appeared
from
the
inner
room
tom
left
off
hauling
his
prize
towards
the
passage
and
felt
and
looked
very
foolish
this
fellow
and
another
whom
i
have
turned
out
upset
that
form
with
all
the
little
boys
on
it
he
said
apologetically
it
a
lie
me
roared
the
captive
to
whom
tom
administered
a
sound
box
on
the
ear
while
the
small
boys
rubbing
different
parts
of
their
bodies
chorused
was
him
teacher
was
him
and
heaped
further
charges
of
pinching
and
other
atrocities
on
him
grey
astonished
tom
by
his
firmness
do
strike
him
again
he
said
now
go
out
at
once
or
i
will
send
for
your
father
the
fellow
got
up
and
after
standing
a
moment
and
considering
his
chance
of
successful
resistance
to
physical
force
in
the
person
of
tom
and
moral
in
that
of
grey
slunk
out
you
must
go
too
murphy
went
on
grey
to
another
of
the
intruders
oh
your
honor
let
me
bide
i
be
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
pleaded
the
irish
boy
and
tom
would
have
given
in
but
grey
was
unyielding
you
were
turned
out
last
week
and
jones
said
you
were
not
to
come
back
for
a
fortnight
well
good
night
to
your
honor
said
murphy
and
took
himself
off
the
rest
may
stop
said
grey
you
had
better
take
the
inner
room
now
i
will
stay
here
i
very
sorry
said
tom
you
could
help
it
no
one
can
manage
those
two
murphy
is
quite
different
but
i
should
have
spoiled
him
if
i
had
let
him
stay
now
the
remaining
half
hour
passed
off
quietly
tom
retired
into
the
inner
room
and
took
up
grey
lesson
which
he
had
been
reading
to
the
boys
from
a
large
bible
with
pictures
out
of
consideration
for
their
natural
and
acquired
restlessness
the
little
fellows
who
were
all
between
eight
and
eleven
years
old
were
only
kept
sitting
at
their
pothooks
and
spelling
for
the
first
half
hour
or
so
and
then
were
allowed
to
crowd
round
the
teacher
who
read
and
talked
to
them
and
showed
them
the
pictures
tom
found
the
bible
open
at
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
and
read
it
out
to
them
as
they
clustered
round
his
knees
some
of
the
outside
ones
fidgeted
about
a
little
but
those
close
round
him
listened
with
ears
and
eyes
and
bated
breath
and
two
little
boys
without
shoes
their
ragged
clothes
concealed
by
long
pinafores
which
their
widowed
mother
had
put
on
clean
to
send
them
to
school
leaned
against
him
and
looked
up
in
his
face
and
his
heart
warmed
to
the
touch
and
the
look
please
teacher
read
it
again
they
said
when
he
finished
so
he
read
it
again
and
sighed
when
grey
came
in
and
lighted
a
candle
for
the
room
was
getting
dark
and
said
it
was
time
for
prayers
a
few
collects
and
the
lord
prayer
in
which
all
the
young
voices
joined
drowning
for
a
minute
the
noises
from
the
court
outside
finished
the
evening
schooling
the
children
trooped
out
and
grey
went
to
speak
to
the
woman
who
kept
the
house
tom
left
to
himself
felt
strangely
happy
and
for
something
to
do
took
the
snuffers
and
commenced
a
crusade
against
a
large
family
of
bugs
who
taking
advantage
of
the
quiet
came
cruising
out
of
a
crack
in
the
otherwise
neatly
papered
wall
some
dozen
had
fallen
on
his
spear
when
grey
reappeared
and
was
much
horrified
at
the
sight
he
called
the
woman
and
told
her
to
have
the
hole
carefully
fumigated
and
mended
i
thought
we
had
killed
them
all
long
ago
he
said
but
the
place
is
tumbling
down
it
looks
well
enough
said
tom
yes
we
have
it
kept
as
tidy
as
possible
it
ought
to
be
at
least
a
little
better
than
what
the
children
see
at
home
and
so
they
left
the
school
and
court
and
walked
up
to
college
where
are
you
going
tom
said
as
they
entered
the
gate
to
hardy
rooms
will
you
come
no
not
said
tom
i
know
that
you
want
to
be
reading
i
should
only
interrupt
well
good
night
then
said
grey
and
went
on
leaving
tom
standing
in
the
porch
on
the
way
up
from
the
school
he
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
hardy
rooms
that
night
he
longed
and
yet
feared
to
do
so
and
on
the
whole
was
not
sorry
for
an
excuse
their
first
meeting
must
be
alone
and
it
would
be
a
very
embarrassing
one
for
him
at
any
rate
grey
he
hoped
would
tell
hardy
of
his
visit
to
the
school
and
that
would
show
that
he
was
coming
round
and
make
the
meeting
easier
his
talk
with
grey
too
had
removed
one
great
cause
of
uneasiness
from
his
mind
it
was
now
quite
clear
that
he
had
no
suspicion
of
the
quarrel
and
if
hardy
had
not
told
him
no
one
else
could
know
of
it
altogether
he
strolled
into
the
quadrangle
a
happier
and
sounder
man
than
he
had
been
since
his
first
visit
to
the
choughs
and
looked
up
and
answered
with
his
old
look
and
voice
when
he
heard
his
name
called
from
one
of
the
windows
the
hailer
was
drysdale
who
was
leaning
out
in
lounging
coat
and
velvet
cap
and
enjoying
a
cigar
as
usual
in
the
midst
of
the
flowers
of
his
hanging
garden
you
heard
the
good
news
i
suppose
no
what
do
you
mean
why
blake
has
got
the
latin
verse
hurrah
i
so
glad
come
up
and
have
a
weed
tom
ran
up
the
staircase
and
into
drysdale
rooms
and
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
at
his
side
in
another
minute
what
does
he
get
by
it
he
said
do
you
know
no
some
books
bound
in
russia
i
dare
say
with
the
oxford
arms
and
illuminatio
mea
on
the
back
no
money
not
much
perhaps
a
answered
drysdale
but
no
end
of
greek
text
kudoz
i
suppose
it
makes
it
look
well
for
his
first
do
you
think
but
i
wish
he
had
got
some
money
for
it
i
often
feel
very
uncomfortable
about
that
bill
do
you
not
i
what
the
good
it
nothing
when
you
are
used
to
it
besides
it
do
fall
due
for
another
six
weeks
but
if
blake
ca
meet
it
then
said
tom
w
ell
it
will
be
vacation
and
i
trouble
greasy
benjamin
to
catch
me
then
but
you
do
mean
to
say
you
wo
pay
it
said
tom
in
horror
pay
it
you
may
trust
benjamin
for
that
he
pull
round
his
little
usuries
somehow
only
we
have
promised
to
pay
on
a
certain
day
you
know
oh
of
course
that
the
form
that
only
means
that
he
pinch
us
sooner
i
do
hope
though
drysdale
that
it
will
be
paid
on
the
day
said
tom
who
could
not
quite
swallow
the
notion
of
forfeiting
his
word
even
though
it
were
only
a
promise
to
pay
to
a
scoundrel
all
right
you
nothing
to
do
with
it
remember
he
bother
you
besides
you
can
plead
infancy
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
there
such
a
queer
old
bird
gone
to
your
friend
hardy
rooms
the
mention
of
hardy
broke
the
disagreeable
train
of
thought
into
which
tom
was
falling
and
he
listened
eagerly
as
drysdale
went
on
it
was
about
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
looking
out
here
and
saw
an
old
fellow
come
hobbling
into
quad
on
two
sticks
in
a
shady
blue
uniform
coat
and
white
trousers
the
kind
of
old
boy
you
read
about
in
books
you
know
commodore
trunnion
or
uncle
toby
or
one
of
that
sort
well
i
watched
him
backing
and
filling
about
the
quad
and
trying
one
staircase
and
another
but
there
was
nobody
about
so
down
i
trotted
and
went
up
to
him
for
fun
and
to
see
what
he
was
after
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
if
you
could
have
seen
it
i
was
ass
enough
to
take
off
my
cap
and
make
a
low
bow
as
i
came
up
to
him
and
he
pulled
off
his
uniform
cap
in
return
and
we
stood
there
bowing
to
one
another
he
was
a
thorough
old
gentleman
and
i
felt
rather
foolish
for
fear
that
he
should
see
that
i
expected
a
lark
when
i
came
out
but
i
think
he
had
an
idea
of
it
and
only
set
my
capping
him
down
to
the
wonderful
good
manners
of
the
college
so
we
got
quite
thick
and
i
piloted
him
across
to
hardy
staircase
in
the
back
quad
i
wanted
him
to
come
up
and
quench
but
he
declined
with
many
apologies
i
sure
he
is
a
character
he
must
be
hardy
father
said
tom
i
should
wonder
but
is
his
father
in
the
navy
he
is
a
retired
captain
then
no
doubt
you
right
what
shall
we
do
have
a
hand
at
picquet
some
men
will
be
here
directly
only
for
love
tom
declined
the
proffered
game
and
went
off
soon
after
to
his
own
rooms
a
happier
man
than
he
had
been
since
his
first
night
at
the
choughs
chapter
xx
the
reconciliation
tom
rose
in
the
morning
with
a
presentiment
that
all
would
be
over
now
before
long
and
to
make
his
presentiment
come
true
resolved
before
night
to
go
himself
to
hardy
and
give
in
all
he
reserved
to
himself
was
the
liberty
to
do
it
in
the
manner
which
would
be
least
painful
to
himself
he
was
greatly
annoyed
therefore
when
hardy
did
not
appear
at
morning
chapel
for
he
had
fixed
on
the
leaving
chapel
as
the
least
unpleasant
time
in
which
to
begin
his
confession
and
was
going
to
catch
hardy
then
and
follow
him
to
his
rooms
all
the
morning
too
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
by
his
scout
wiggins
hardy
scout
replied
that
his
master
was
out
or
busy
he
did
not
come
to
the
boats
he
did
not
appear
in
hall
so
that
after
hall
when
tom
went
back
to
his
own
rooms
as
he
did
at
once
instead
of
sauntering
out
of
college
or
going
to
a
wine
party
he
was
quite
out
of
heart
at
his
bad
luck
and
began
to
be
afraid
that
he
would
have
to
sleep
on
his
unhealed
wound
another
night
he
sat
down
in
an
and
fell
to
musing
and
thought
how
wonderfully
his
life
had
been
changed
in
these
few
short
weeks
he
could
hardly
get
back
across
the
gulf
which
separated
him
from
the
self
who
had
come
back
into
those
rooms
after
easter
full
of
anticipations
of
the
pleasures
and
delights
of
the
coming
summer
term
and
vacation
to
his
own
surprise
he
did
seem
much
to
regret
the
loss
of
his
en
and
felt
a
sort
of
grim
satisfaction
in
their
utter
overthrow
while
occupied
with
these
thoughts
he
heard
talking
on
his
stairs
accompanied
by
a
strange
lumbering
tread
these
came
nearer
and
at
last
stopped
just
outside
his
door
which
opened
in
another
moment
and
wiggins
announced
capting
hardy
sir
tom
jumped
to
his
legs
and
felt
himself
colour
painfully
here
wiggins
said
he
wheel
round
that
for
captain
hardy
i
am
so
very
glad
to
see
you
sir
and
he
hastened
round
himself
to
meet
the
old
gentleman
holding
out
his
hand
which
the
visitor
took
very
cordially
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
his
heavy
stick
to
his
left
hand
and
balanced
himself
safely
upon
it
thank
you
sir
thank
you
said
the
old
man
after
a
few
moments
pause
i
find
your
companion
ladders
rather
steep
and
then
he
sat
down
with
some
difficulty
tom
took
the
captain
stick
and
undress
cap
and
put
them
reverentially
on
his
sideboard
and
then
to
get
rid
of
some
little
nervousness
which
he
could
help
feeling
bustled
to
his
cupboard
and
helped
wiggins
to
place
glasses
and
biscuits
on
the
table
now
sir
what
will
you
take
i
have
port
sherry
and
whisky
here
and
can
get
you
anything
else
wiggins
run
to
hinton
and
get
some
dessert
no
dessert
thank
you
for
me
said
the
captain
i
take
a
cup
of
coffee
or
a
glass
of
grog
or
anything
you
have
ready
do
open
wine
for
me
pray
sir
oh
it
is
all
the
better
for
being
opened
said
tom
working
away
at
a
bottle
of
sherry
with
his
corkscrew
and
wiggins
get
some
coffee
and
anchovy
toast
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
just
put
out
some
tumblers
and
toddy
ladles
and
bring
up
boiling
water
with
the
coffee
while
making
his
hospitable
preparations
tom
managed
to
get
many
side
glances
at
the
old
man
who
sat
looking
steadily
and
abstractly
before
him
into
the
fireplace
and
was
much
struck
and
touched
by
the
picture
the
sailor
wore
a
old
undress
uniform
coat
and
waistcoat
and
white
drill
trousers
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
but
gaunt
and
massive
and
tom
recognized
the
framework
of
the
long
arms
and
grand
shoulders
and
chest
which
he
had
so
often
admired
in
the
son
his
right
leg
was
quite
stiff
from
an
old
wound
on
the
knee
cap
the
left
eye
was
sightless
and
the
scar
of
a
cutlass
travelled
down
the
drooping
lid
and
on
to
the
cheek
below
his
head
was
high
and
broad
his
hair
and
whiskers
silver
white
while
the
shaggy
eyebrows
were
scarcely
grizzled
his
face
was
deeply
lined
and
the
long
lower
jaw
and
drawn
look
about
the
mouth
gave
a
grim
expression
to
the
face
at
the
first
glance
which
wore
off
as
you
looked
leaving
however
on
most
men
who
thought
about
it
the
impression
which
fastened
on
our
hero
an
awkward
man
to
have
met
at
the
head
of
boarders
towards
the
end
of
the
great
war
in
a
minute
or
two
tom
having
completed
his
duties
faced
the
old
sailor
much
reassured
by
his
covert
inspection
and
pouring
himself
out
a
glass
of
sherry
pushed
the
decanter
across
and
drank
to
his
guest
your
health
sir
he
said
and
thank
you
very
much
for
coming
up
to
see
me
thank
sir
said
the
captain
rousing
himself
and
filling
i
drink
to
you
sir
the
fact
is
i
took
a
great
liberty
in
coming
up
to
your
rooms
in
this
way
without
calling
or
sending
up
but
you
excuse
it
in
an
old
sailor
here
the
captain
took
to
his
glass
and
seemed
a
little
embarrassed
tom
felt
embarrassed
also
feeling
that
something
was
coming
and
could
only
think
of
asking
how
the
captain
liked
the
sherry
the
captain
liked
the
sherry
very
much
then
suddenly
clearing
his
throat
he
went
on
i
felt
sir
that
you
would
excuse
me
for
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
he
paused
again
while
tom
muttered
something
about
great
pleasure
and
then
went
on
you
know
my
son
mr
brown
yes
sir
he
has
been
my
best
friend
up
here
i
owe
more
to
him
than
to
any
man
in
oxford
the
captain
eye
gleamed
with
pleasure
as
he
replied
jack
is
a
noble
fellow
brown
though
i
say
it
who
am
his
father
often
promised
myself
a
cruise
to
oxford
since
he
has
been
here
i
came
here
at
last
yesterday
and
have
been
having
a
long
yarn
with
him
i
found
there
was
something
on
his
mind
he
ca
keep
anything
from
his
old
father
and
so
i
drew
out
of
him
that
he
loves
you
as
david
loved
jonathan
he
made
my
old
eye
very
dim
while
he
was
talking
of
you
brown
and
then
i
found
that
you
two
are
not
as
you
used
to
be
some
coldness
sprung
up
between
you
but
what
about
i
could
get
at
young
men
are
often
know
i
was
forty
years
says
he
has
been
hasty
with
you
now
that
boy
is
all
i
have
in
the
world
brown
i
know
my
boy
friend
will
like
to
send
an
old
man
home
with
a
light
heart
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
over
to
you
and
ask
you
to
make
it
up
with
jack
i
gave
him
the
slip
after
dinner
and
here
i
am
oh
sir
did
he
really
ask
you
to
come
to
me
no
sir
said
the
captain
he
did
am
sorry
for
think
jack
must
be
in
the
wrong
for
he
said
he
had
been
too
hasty
and
yet
he
would
ask
me
to
come
to
you
and
make
it
up
but
he
is
young
sir
young
and
proud
he
said
he
could
move
in
it
his
mind
was
made
up
he
was
wretched
enough
over
it
but
the
move
must
come
from
you
and
so
that
the
favor
i
have
to
ask
that
you
will
make
it
up
with
jack
it
is
often
a
young
man
can
do
such
a
favor
to
an
old
one
to
an
old
father
with
one
son
you
not
feel
the
worse
for
having
done
it
if
it
ever
so
hard
to
do
when
you
come
to
be
my
age
and
the
old
man
looked
wistfully
across
the
table
the
muscles
about
his
mouth
quivering
as
he
ended
tom
sprang
from
his
chair
and
grasped
the
old
sailor
hand
as
he
felt
the
load
pass
out
of
his
heart
favour
sir
he
said
i
have
been
a
mad
fool
enough
already
in
this
business
i
should
have
been
a
scoundrel
like
enough
by
this
time
but
for
your
son
and
i
quarrelled
with
him
for
stopping
me
at
the
pit
mouth
favor
if
god
will
i
prove
somehow
where
the
favor
lies
and
what
i
owe
to
him
and
to
you
sir
for
coming
to
me
tonight
stop
here
two
minutes
sir
and
i
run
down
and
bring
him
over
tom
tore
away
to
hardy
door
and
knocked
there
was
no
pausing
in
the
passage
now
come
in
he
opened
the
door
but
did
not
enter
and
for
a
moment
or
two
could
not
speak
the
rush
of
associations
which
the
sight
of
the
old
rickety
furniture
and
the
figure
which
was
seated
book
in
hand
with
its
back
to
the
door
and
its
feet
against
one
side
of
the
called
up
choked
him
i
come
in
he
said
at
last
he
saw
the
figure
give
a
start
and
the
book
trembled
a
little
but
then
came
the
answer
slow
but
firm
i
have
not
changed
my
opinion
no
dear
old
boy
but
i
have
and
tom
rushed
across
to
his
friend
dearer
than
ever
to
him
now
and
threw
his
arm
round
his
neck
and
if
the
truth
must
out
had
three
parts
of
a
mind
to
kiss
the
rough
face
which
was
now
working
with
strong
emotion
thank
god
said
hardy
as
he
grasped
the
hand
which
hung
over
his
shoulder
and
now
come
over
to
my
room
your
father
is
there
waiting
for
us
what
the
dear
old
governor
that
what
he
has
been
after
is
it
i
could
think
where
he
could
have
to
as
he
would
say
hardy
put
on
his
cap
and
the
two
hurried
back
to
tom
rooms
the
lightest
hearts
in
the
university
of
oxford
chapter
xxi
captain
hardy
entertained
by
ambrose
there
are
moments
in
the
life
of
the
most
and
sober
of
us
all
when
we
fairly
bubble
over
like
a
full
bottle
of
champagne
with
the
cork
out
and
this
was
one
of
them
for
our
hero
who
however
be
it
remarked
was
neither
nor
sober
by
nature
when
they
got
back
to
his
rooms
he
really
hardly
knew
what
to
do
to
give
vent
to
his
lightness
of
heart
and
hardy
though
and
sober
enough
in
general
was
on
this
occasion
almost
as
bad
as
his
friend
they
rattled
on
talked
out
the
thing
which
came
uppermost
whatever
the
subject
might
chance
to
be
but
whether
grave
or
gay
it
always
ended
after
a
minute
or
two
in
jokes
not
always
good
and
chaff
and
laughter
the
poor
captain
was
a
little
puzzled
at
first
and
made
one
or
two
endeavours
to
turn
the
talk
into
improving
channels
but
very
soon
he
saw
that
jack
was
thoroughly
happy
and
that
was
always
enough
for
him
so
he
listened
to
one
and
the
other
joining
cheerily
in
the
laugh
whenever
he
could
and
when
he
could
catch
the
joke
looking
like
a
benevolent
old
lion
and
making
as
much
belief
that
he
had
understood
it
all
as
the
simplicity
and
truthfulness
of
his
character
would
allow
the
spirits
of
the
two
friends
seemed
inexhaustible
they
lasted
out
the
bottle
of
sherry
which
tom
had
uncorked
and
the
remains
of
a
bottle
of
his
famous
port
he
had
tried
hard
to
be
allowed
to
open
a
fresh
bottle
but
the
captain
had
made
such
a
point
of
his
not
doing
so
that
he
had
given
in
for
hospitality
sake
they
lasted
out
the
coffee
and
anchovy
toast
after
which
the
captain
made
a
little
effort
at
moving
which
was
supplicatingly
stopped
by
tom
oh
pray
do
go
captain
hardy
i
have
been
so
happy
for
months
besides
i
must
brew
you
a
glass
of
grog
i
pride
myself
on
my
brew
your
son
there
will
tell
you
that
i
am
a
dead
hand
at
it
here
wiggins
a
lemon
shouted
tom
well
for
once
in
a
way
i
suppose
eh
jack
said
the
captain
looking
at
his
son
oh
yes
father
you
may
know
it
brown
but
if
there
is
one
thing
harder
to
do
than
another
it
is
to
get
an
old
sailor
like
my
father
to
take
a
glass
of
grog
at
night
the
captain
laughed
a
little
laugh
and
shook
his
thick
stick
at
his
son
who
went
on
and
as
for
asking
him
to
take
a
pipe
with
it
dear
me
said
tom
i
quite
forgot
i
really
beg
your
pardon
captain
hardy
and
he
put
down
the
lemon
he
was
squeezing
and
produced
a
box
of
cigars
it
all
jack
nonsense
sir
said
the
captain
holding
out
his
hand
nevertheless
for
the
box
now
father
do
be
absurd
interrupted
hardy
snatching
the
box
away
from
him
you
might
as
well
give
him
a
glass
of
absinthe
he
is
at
home
and
ca
smoke
anything
but
a
long
clay
i
very
sorry
i
have
one
here
but
i
can
send
out
in
a
minute
and
tom
was
making
for
the
door
to
shout
for
wiggins
no
do
call
i
fetch
some
from
my
rooms
when
hardy
left
the
room
tom
squeezed
away
at
his
lemon
and
was
preparing
himself
for
a
speech
to
captain
hardy
full
of
confession
and
gratitude
but
the
captain
was
before
him
and
led
the
conversation
into
a
most
unexpected
channel
i
suppose
now
brown
he
began
you
do
find
any
difficulty
in
construing
your
thucydides
indeed
i
do
sir
said
tom
laughing
i
find
him
a
very
tough
old
customer
except
in
the
simplest
narrative
for
my
part
said
the
captain
i
ca
get
on
at
all
i
find
without
a
translation
but
you
see
sir
i
had
none
of
the
advantages
which
you
young
men
have
up
here
in
fact
brown
i
did
begin
greek
till
jack
was
nearly
ten
years
old
the
captain
in
his
secret
heart
was
prouder
of
his
partial
victory
over
the
greek
tongue
in
his
old
age
than
of
his
undisputed
triumphs
over
the
french
in
his
youth
and
was
not
averse
to
talking
of
it
i
wonder
that
you
ever
began
it
at
all
sir
said
tom
you
would
wonder
if
you
knew
how
an
uneducated
man
like
me
feels
when
he
comes
to
a
place
like
oxford
uneducated
sir
said
tom
why
your
education
has
been
worth
twice
as
much
i
sure
as
any
we
get
here
no
sir
we
never
learnt
anything
in
the
navy
when
i
was
a
youngster
except
a
little
mathematics
one
picked
up
a
sort
of
smattering
of
a
language
or
two
knocking
about
the
world
but
no
grammatical
knowledge
nothing
scientific
if
a
boy
does
get
a
method
he
is
beating
to
windward
in
a
crank
craft
all
his
life
he
has
got
any
regular
place
to
stow
away
what
he
gets
into
his
brains
and
so
it
lies
tumbling
about
in
the
hold
and
he
loses
it
or
it
gets
damaged
and
is
never
ready
for
use
you
see
what
i
mean
mr
brown
yes
sir
but
i
afraid
we
do
all
of
us
get
much
method
up
here
do
you
really
enjoy
reading
thucydides
now
captain
hardy
indeed
i
do
sir
very
much
said
the
captain
there
a
great
deal
in
his
history
to
interest
an
old
sailor
you
know
i
dare
say
now
that
i
enjoy
those
parts
about
the
more
than
you
do
the
captain
looked
at
tom
as
if
he
had
made
an
audacious
remark
i
am
sure
you
do
sir
said
tom
smiling
because
you
see
brown
said
the
captain
when
one
has
been
in
that
sort
of
thing
oneself
one
likes
to
read
how
people
in
other
times
managed
and
to
think
what
one
would
have
done
in
their
place
i
do
believe
that
the
greeks
just
at
that
time
were
very
resolute
fighters
though
nelson
or
collingwood
would
have
finished
that
war
in
a
year
or
two
not
with
triremes
do
you
think
sir
said
tom
yes
sir
with
any
vessels
which
were
to
be
had
said
the
captain
but
you
are
right
about
triremes
it
has
always
been
a
great
puzzle
to
me
how
those
triremes
could
have
been
worked
how
do
you
understand
the
three
banks
of
oars
mr
brown
well
sir
i
suppose
they
must
have
been
one
above
the
other
somehow
but
the
upper
bank
must
have
had
oars
twenty
feet
long
and
more
in
that
case
said
the
captain
you
must
allow
for
leverage
you
see
of
course
sir
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
it
is
easy
to
see
how
they
were
manned
and
worked
said
tom
now
my
notion
about
triremes
began
the
captain
holding
the
head
of
his
stick
with
both
hands
and
looking
across
at
tom
why
father
cried
hardy
returning
at
the
moment
with
the
pipes
and
catching
the
captain
last
word
on
one
of
your
hobby
horses
already
you
not
safe
i
ca
leave
you
for
two
minutes
here
a
long
pipe
for
you
how
in
the
world
did
he
get
on
triremes
i
hardly
know
said
tom
but
i
want
to
hear
what
captain
hardy
thinks
about
them
you
were
saying
sir
that
the
upper
oars
must
have
been
twenty
feet
long
at
least
my
notion
is
said
the
captain
taking
the
pipe
and
from
his
son
hand
stop
one
moment
said
hardy
i
found
blake
at
my
rooms
and
asked
him
to
come
over
here
you
do
object
object
my
dear
fellow
i
much
obliged
to
you
now
hardy
would
you
like
to
have
anyone
else
i
can
send
in
a
minute
no
one
thank
you
you
wo
stand
on
ceremony
now
will
you
with
me
said
tom
you
see
i
have
and
you
never
will
again
no
never
now
father
you
can
heave
ahead
about
those
oars
the
captain
went
on
charging
his
pipe
and
proceeded
you
see
brown
they
must
have
been
at
least
twenty
feet
long
because
if
you
allow
the
lowest
bank
of
oars
to
have
been
three
feet
above
the
which
even
jack
thinks
they
must
have
been
certainly
that
height
at
least
to
do
any
good
said
hardy
not
that
i
think
jack
opinion
worth
much
on
the
point
went
on
his
father
it
very
ungrateful
of
you
then
to
say
so
father
said
hardy
after
all
the
time
i
wasted
trying
to
make
it
all
clear
to
you
i
do
say
that
jack
is
not
a
good
opinion
on
most
things
brown
said
the
captain
but
he
is
all
at
sea
about
triremes
he
believes
that
the
men
of
the
uppermost
bank
rowed
somehow
like
lightermen
on
the
thames
walking
up
and
down
i
object
to
your
statement
of
my
faith
father
said
hardy
now
you
know
jack
you
have
said
so
often
i
have
said
they
must
have
stood
up
to
row
and
so
you
would
have
had
awful
confusion
jack
you
must
have
order
between
decks
when
you
going
into
action
besides
the
rowers
had
cushions
that
old
heresy
of
yours
again
well
but
jack
they
cushions
did
the
rowers
who
were
marched
across
the
isthmus
to
man
the
ships
which
were
to
surprise
the
piraeus
carry
their
oars
thongs
and
cushions
if
they
did
your
conclusion
does
follow
father
that
they
sat
on
them
to
row
you
hear
brown
said
the
captain
he
admits
my
point
about
the
cushions
oh
father
i
hope
you
used
to
fight
the
french
more
fairly
said
hardy
but
did
he
did
jack
admit
my
point
implicitly
sir
i
think
said
tom
catching
hardy
eye
which
was
dancing
with
fun
of
course
he
did
you
hear
that
jack
now
my
notion
about
triremes
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
the
captain
again
and
blake
came
in
and
was
introduced
blake
is
almost
our
best
scholar
father
you
should
appeal
to
him
about
the
cushions
i
am
very
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
said
the
captain
i
have
heard
my
son
speak
of
you
often
we
were
talking
about
triremes
said
tom
captain
hardy
thinks
the
oars
must
have
been
twenty
feet
long
not
easy
to
come
forward
well
with
that
sort
of
oar
said
blake
they
must
have
pulled
a
slow
stroke
our
torpid
would
have
bumped
the
best
of
them
said
hardy
i
do
think
they
could
have
made
more
than
six
knots
said
the
captain
but
yet
they
used
to
sink
one
another
and
a
light
boat
going
only
six
knots
could
break
another
in
two
it
a
puzzling
subject
mr
blake
it
is
sir
said
blake
if
we
only
had
some
of
their
songs
we
should
know
more
about
it
i
afraid
they
had
no
dibdin
i
wish
you
would
turn
one
of
my
father
favorite
songs
into
anapaests
for
him
said
hardy
what
are
they
said
blake
bowling
or
wind
that
blows
and
the
ship
that
goes
and
the
lass
that
loves
a
sailor
by
the
way
why
should
we
have
a
song
said
tom
what
do
you
say
captain
hardy
the
captain
winced
a
little
as
he
saw
his
chance
of
expounding
his
notion
as
to
triremes
slipping
away
but
answered
by
all
means
sir
jack
must
sing
for
me
though
did
you
ever
hear
him
sing
bowling
no
never
sir
why
hardy
you
never
told
me
you
could
sing
you
never
asked
me
said
hardy
laughing
but
if
i
sing
for
my
father
he
must
spin
us
a
yarn
oh
yes
will
you
sir
i
do
my
best
brown
but
i
do
know
that
you
care
to
listen
to
my
old
yarns
jack
thinks
everybody
must
like
them
as
well
as
he
who
used
to
hear
them
when
he
was
a
child
thank
you
sir
that
famous
now
hardy
strike
up
after
you
you
must
set
the
example
in
your
own
rooms
so
tom
sang
his
song
and
the
noise
brought
drysdale
and
another
man
up
who
were
loitering
in
quad
on
the
lookout
for
something
to
do
drysdale
and
the
captain
recognised
one
another
and
were
friends
at
once
and
then
hardy
sang
tom
bowling
in
a
style
which
astonished
the
rest
not
a
little
and
as
usual
nearly
made
his
father
cry
and
blake
sang
and
drysdale
and
the
other
man
and
then
the
captain
was
called
on
for
his
yarn
and
the
general
voice
being
for
something
that
had
happened
to
him
the
strangest
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
at
sea
the
old
gentleman
laid
down
his
pipe
and
sat
up
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
on
his
stick
and
began
the
captain
story
it
will
be
forty
years
ago
next
month
since
the
ship
i
was
then
in
came
home
from
the
west
indies
station
and
was
paid
off
i
had
nowhere
in
particular
to
go
just
then
and
so
was
very
glad
to
get
a
letter
the
morning
after
i
went
ashore
at
portsmouth
asking
me
to
go
down
to
plymouth
for
a
week
or
so
it
came
from
an
old
sailor
a
friend
of
my
family
who
had
been
commodore
of
the
fleet
he
lived
at
plymouth
he
was
a
thorough
old
sailor
what
you
young
men
would
call
an
old
salt
and
live
out
of
sight
of
the
blue
sea
and
the
shipping
it
is
a
disease
that
a
good
many
of
us
take
who
have
spent
our
best
years
on
the
sea
i
have
it
myself
a
sort
of
feeling
that
we
want
to
be
under
another
kind
of
providence
when
we
look
out
and
see
a
hill
on
this
side
and
a
hill
on
that
it
wonderful
to
see
the
trees
come
out
and
the
corn
grow
but
then
it
does
come
so
home
to
an
old
sailor
i
know
that
we
all
just
as
much
under
the
lord
hand
on
shore
as
at
sea
but
you
ca
read
in
a
book
you
have
been
used
to
and
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
they
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
it
is
their
fault
if
they
do
see
his
wonders
on
the
land
so
easily
as
other
people
but
for
all
that
there
no
man
enjoys
a
cruise
in
the
country
more
than
a
sailor
it
forty
years
ago
since
i
started
for
plymouth
but
i
have
forgotten
the
road
a
bit
or
how
beautiful
it
was
all
through
the
new
forest
and
over
salisbury
plain
and
then
by
the
mail
to
exeter
and
through
devonshire
it
took
me
three
days
to
get
to
plymouth
for
we
did
get
about
so
quick
in
those
days
the
commodore
was
very
kind
to
me
when
i
got
there
and
i
went
about
with
him
to
the
ships
in
the
bay
and
through
the
and
picked
up
a
good
deal
that
was
of
use
to
me
afterwards
i
was
a
lieutenant
in
those
days
and
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
and
i
found
the
old
commodore
had
a
great
nephew
whom
he
had
adopted
and
had
set
his
whole
heart
upon
he
was
an
old
bachelor
himself
but
the
boy
had
come
to
live
with
him
and
was
to
go
to
sea
so
he
wanted
to
put
him
under
some
one
who
would
give
an
eye
to
him
for
the
first
year
or
two
he
was
a
light
slip
of
a
boy
then
fourteen
years
old
with
deep
set
blue
eyes
and
long
eyelashes
and
cheeks
like
a
girl
but
brave
as
a
lion
and
as
merry
as
a
lark
the
old
gentleman
was
very
pleased
to
see
that
we
took
to
one
another
we
used
to
bathe
and
boat
together
and
he
was
never
tired
of
hearing
my
stories
about
the
great
admirals
and
the
fleet
and
the
stations
i
had
been
on
well
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
apply
for
a
ship
again
directly
and
go
up
to
london
with
a
letter
to
the
admiralty
from
the
commodore
to
help
things
on
after
a
month
or
two
i
was
appointed
to
a
brig
lying
at
spithead
and
so
i
wrote
off
to
the
commodore
and
he
got
his
boy
a
midshipman
berth
on
board
and
brought
him
to
portsmouth
himself
a
day
or
two
before
we
sailed
for
the
mediterranean
the
old
gentleman
came
on
board
to
see
the
boy
hammock
slung
and
went
below
into
the
cockpit
to
make
sure
that
all
was
right
he
only
left
us
by
the
pilot
boat
when
we
were
well
out
in
the
channel
he
was
very
low
at
parting
with
his
boy
but
bore
up
as
well
as
he
could
and
we
promised
to
write
to
him
from
gibraltar
and
as
often
afterwards
as
we
had
a
chance
i
was
soon
as
proud
and
fond
of
little
tom
holdsworth
as
if
he
had
been
my
own
younger
brother
and
for
that
matter
so
were
all
the
crew
from
our
captain
to
the
cook
boy
he
was
such
a
gallant
youngster
and
yet
so
gentle
in
one
business
we
had
he
climbed
over
the
boatswain
shoulder
and
was
almost
first
on
deck
how
he
came
out
of
it
without
a
scratch
i
think
to
this
day
but
he
had
a
bit
of
bluster
in
him
and
was
as
kind
as
a
woman
to
anyone
who
was
wounded
or
down
with
sickness
after
we
had
been
out
about
a
year
we
were
sent
to
cruise
off
malta
on
the
for
the
french
fleet
it
was
a
long
business
and
the
post
was
so
good
then
as
it
is
now
we
were
sometimes
for
months
without
getting
a
letter
and
knew
nothing
of
what
was
happening
at
home
or
anywhere
else
we
had
a
sick
time
too
on
board
and
at
last
he
got
a
fever
he
bore
up
against
it
like
a
man
and
would
knock
off
duty
for
a
long
time
he
was
midshipman
of
my
watch
so
i
used
to
make
him
turn
in
early
and
tried
to
ease
things
to
him
as
much
as
i
could
but
he
pick
up
and
i
began
to
get
very
anxious
about
him
i
talked
to
the
doctor
and
turned
matters
over
in
my
own
mind
and
at
last
i
came
to
think
he
would
get
any
better
unless
he
could
sleep
out
of
the
cockpit
so
one
night
the
of
october
it
was
i
remember
it
well
enough
better
than
i
remember
any
day
since
it
was
a
dirty
night
blowing
half
a
gale
of
wind
from
the
southward
and
we
were
under
i
had
the
first
watch
and
at
nine
i
sent
him
down
to
my
cabin
to
sleep
there
where
he
would
be
fresher
and
quieter
and
i
was
to
turn
into
his
hammock
when
my
watch
was
over
i
was
on
deck
three
hours
or
so
after
he
went
down
and
the
weather
got
dirtier
and
dirtier
and
the
scud
drove
by
and
the
wind
sang
and
hummed
through
the
rigging
it
made
me
melancholy
to
listen
to
it
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
youngster
down
below
and
what
i
should
say
to
his
poor
old
uncle
if
anything
happened
well
soon
after
midnight
i
went
down
and
turned
into
his
hammock
i
did
go
to
sleep
at
once
for
i
remember
very
well
listening
to
the
creaking
of
the
ship
timbers
as
she
rose
to
the
swell
and
watching
the
lamp
which
was
slung
from
the
ceiling
and
gave
light
enough
to
make
out
the
other
hammocks
swinging
slowly
altogether
at
last
however
i
dropped
off
and
i
reckon
i
must
have
been
asleep
about
an
hour
when
i
woke
with
a
start
for
the
first
moment
i
did
see
anything
but
the
swinging
hammocks
and
the
lamp
but
then
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
some
one
was
standing
by
my
hammock
and
i
saw
the
figure
as
plainly
as
i
see
any
one
of
you
now
for
the
foot
of
the
hammock
was
close
to
the
lamp
and
the
light
struck
full
across
on
the
head
and
shoulders
which
was
all
that
i
could
see
of
him
there
he
was
the
old
commodore
his
grizzled
hair
coming
out
from
under
a
red
woolen
nightcap
and
his
shoulders
wrapped
in
an
old
blue
which
i
had
often
seen
him
in
his
face
looked
pale
and
drawn
and
there
was
a
wistful
disappointed
look
about
the
eyes
i
was
so
taken
aback
i
could
not
speak
but
lay
watching
him
he
looked
full
at
my
face
once
or
twice
but
did
seem
to
recognise
me
and
just
as
i
was
getting
back
my
tongue
and
going
to
speak
he
said
slowly
where
tom
this
is
his
hammock
i
ca
see
tom
and
then
he
looked
vaguely
about
and
passed
away
somehow
but
how
i
could
see
in
a
moment
or
two
i
jumped
out
and
hurried
to
my
cabin
but
young
holdsworth
was
fast
asleep
i
sat
down
and
wrote
down
just
what
i
had
seen
making
a
note
of
the
exact
time
twenty
minutes
to
two
i
turn
in
again
but
sat
watching
the
youngster
when
he
woke
i
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
anything
of
his
great
uncle
by
the
last
mail
yes
he
had
heard
the
old
gentleman
was
rather
feeble
but
nothing
particular
the
matter
i
kept
my
own
counsel
and
never
told
a
soul
in
the
ship
and
when
the
mail
came
to
hand
a
few
days
afterwards
with
a
letter
from
the
commodore
to
his
nephew
dated
late
in
september
saying
that
he
was
well
i
thought
the
figure
by
my
hammock
must
have
been
all
my
own
fancy
however
by
the
next
mail
came
the
news
of
the
old
death
it
had
been
a
very
sudden
break
up
his
executor
said
he
had
left
all
his
property
which
was
not
much
to
his
great
nephew
who
was
to
get
leave
to
come
home
as
soon
as
he
could
the
first
time
we
touched
at
malta
tom
holdsworth
left
us
and
went
home
we
followed
about
two
years
afterwards
and
the
first
thing
i
did
after
landing
was
to
find
out
the
executor
he
was
a
quiet
dry
little
plymouth
lawyer
and
very
civilly
answered
all
my
questions
about
the
last
days
of
my
old
friend
at
last
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
as
near
as
he
could
the
time
of
his
death
and
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
got
his
diary
and
turned
over
the
leaves
i
was
quite
nervous
till
he
looked
up
and
said
minutes
to
two
sir
on
the
morning
of
october
or
it
might
be
a
few
minutes
later
how
do
you
mean
sir
i
asked
well
he
said
it
is
an
odd
story
the
doctor
was
sitting
with
me
watching
the
old
man
and
as
i
tell
you
at
minutes
to
two
he
got
up
and
said
it
was
all
over
we
stood
together
talking
in
whispers
for
it
might
be
four
or
five
minutes
when
the
body
seemed
to
move
he
was
an
odd
old
man
you
know
the
commodore
and
we
never
could
get
him
properly
to
bed
but
he
lay
in
his
red
nightcap
and
old
with
a
blanket
over
him
it
was
not
a
pleasant
sight
i
can
tell
you
sir
i
do
think
one
of
you
gentlemen
who
are
bred
to
face
all
manner
of
dangers
would
have
liked
it
as
i
was
saying
the
body
first
moved
and
then
sat
up
propping
itself
behind
with
its
hands
the
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
looked
at
us
for
a
moment
and
said
slowly
been
to
the
mediterranean
but
i
see
tom
then
the
body
sank
back
again
and
this
time
the
old
commodore
was
really
dead
but
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
happen
to
one
sir
i
do
not
remember
anything
like
it
in
my
forty
years
practice
chapter
xxii
departures
expected
and
unexpected
there
was
a
silence
of
a
few
seconds
after
the
captain
had
finished
his
story
all
the
men
sitting
with
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
not
a
little
surprised
at
the
results
of
their
call
drysdale
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
which
he
did
with
a
by
george
and
a
long
respiration
but
as
he
did
not
seem
prepared
with
any
further
remark
tom
took
up
the
running
what
a
strange
story
he
said
and
that
really
happened
to
you
captain
hardy
to
me
sir
in
the
mediterranean
more
than
forty
years
ago
the
strangest
thing
about
it
is
that
the
old
commodore
should
have
managed
to
get
all
the
way
to
the
ship
and
then
not
have
known
where
his
nephew
was
said
blake
he
only
knew
his
nephew
berth
you
see
sir
said
the
captain
but
he
might
have
beat
about
through
the
ship
till
he
had
found
him
you
must
remember
that
he
was
at
his
last
breath
sir
said
the
captain
you
ca
expect
a
man
to
have
his
head
clear
at
such
a
moment
not
a
man
perhaps
but
i
should
a
ghost
said
blake
time
was
everything
to
him
went
on
the
captain
without
regarding
the
interruption
space
nothing
but
the
strangest
part
of
it
is
that
should
have
seen
the
figure
at
all
true
i
had
been
thinking
of
the
old
uncle
because
of
the
illness
but
i
ca
suppose
he
was
thinking
of
me
and
as
i
say
he
never
recognized
me
i
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
such
matters
since
that
time
but
i
have
never
met
with
just
such
a
case
as
this
no
that
is
the
puzzle
one
can
fancy
his
appearing
to
his
nephew
well
enough
said
tom
we
ca
account
for
these
things
or
for
a
good
many
other
things
which
ought
to
be
quite
as
startling
only
we
see
them
every
day
but
now
i
think
it
is
time
for
us
to
be
going
eh
jack
and
the
captain
and
his
son
rose
to
go
tom
saw
that
it
would
be
no
kindness
to
them
to
try
to
prolong
the
sitting
and
so
he
got
up
too
to
accompany
them
to
the
gates
this
broke
up
the
party
before
going
drysdale
after
whispering
to
tom
went
up
to
captain
hardy
and
said
i
want
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favour
sir
will
you
and
your
son
breakfast
with
me
we
shall
be
very
happy
sir
said
the
captain
i
think
father
you
had
better
breakfast
with
me
quietly
we
are
much
obliged
to
drysdale
but
i
ca
give
up
a
whole
morning
besides
i
have
several
things
to
talk
to
you
about
nonsense
jack
blurted
out
the
old
sailor
leave
your
books
alone
for
one
morning
i
come
up
here
to
enjoy
myself
and
see
your
friends
hardy
gave
a
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulder
at
the
word
friends
and
drysdale
who
saw
it
looked
a
little
confused
he
had
never
asked
hardy
to
his
rooms
before
the
captain
saw
that
something
was
the
matter
and
hastened
in
his
own
way
to
make
all
smooth
again
never
mind
jack
sir
he
said
he
shall
come
it
a
great
treat
to
me
to
be
with
young
men
especially
when
they
are
friends
of
my
boy
i
hope
you
come
as
a
personal
favor
to
me
said
drysdale
turning
to
hardy
brown
you
bring
him
wo
you
oh
yes
i
sure
he
come
said
tom
that
all
right
good
night
then
and
drysdale
went
off
hardy
and
tom
accompanied
the
captain
to
the
gate
during
his
passage
across
the
two
quadrangles
the
old
gentleman
was
full
of
the
praises
of
the
men
and
of
protestations
as
to
the
improvement
in
social
manners
and
customs
since
his
day
when
there
could
have
been
no
such
meeting
he
declared
without
blackguardism
and
drunkenness
at
least
among
young
officers
but
then
they
had
less
to
think
of
than
oxford
men
no
proper
education
and
so
the
captain
was
evidently
traveling
back
into
the
great
trireme
question
when
they
reached
the
gate
as
they
could
go
no
farther
with
him
however
he
had
to
carry
away
his
solution
of
the
difficulty
in
his
own
bosom
to
the
mitre
do
let
us
go
in
said
tom
as
the
gate
closed
on
the
captain
and
they
turned
back
into
the
quadrangle
let
us
take
a
turn
or
two
so
they
walked
up
and
down
the
inner
quad
in
the
starlight
just
at
first
they
were
a
good
deal
embarrassed
and
confused
but
before
long
though
not
without
putting
considerable
force
on
himself
tom
got
back
into
something
like
his
old
familiar
way
of
unbosoming
himself
to
his
friend
and
hardy
showed
more
than
his
old
anxiety
to
meet
him
his
ready
and
undisguised
sympathy
soon
dispersed
the
remaining
clouds
which
were
still
hanging
between
them
and
tom
found
it
almost
a
pleasure
instead
of
a
dreary
task
as
he
had
anticipated
to
make
a
full
confession
and
state
the
case
clearly
and
strongly
against
himself
to
one
who
claimed
neither
by
word
nor
look
the
least
superiority
over
him
and
never
seemed
to
remember
that
he
himself
had
been
in
the
matter
he
had
such
a
chance
of
lecturing
me
and
did
do
it
thought
tom
afterwards
when
he
was
considering
why
he
felt
so
very
grateful
to
hardy
it
was
so
cunning
of
him
too
if
he
had
begun
lecturing
i
should
have
begun
to
defend
myself
and
never
have
felt
half
such
a
scamp
as
i
did
when
i
was
telling
it
all
out
to
him
in
my
own
way
the
result
of
hardy
management
was
that
tom
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
telling
everything
down
to
his
night
at
the
ragged
school
and
what
an
effect
his
of
the
apology
had
had
on
him
here
for
the
first
time
hardy
came
in
with
his
usual
dry
keen
voice
you
need
have
gone
so
far
back
as
plato
for
that
lesson
i
do
understand
said
tom
well
there
something
about
an
indwelling
spirit
which
guideth
every
man
in
paul
is
there
yes
a
great
deal
tom
answered
after
a
pause
but
it
the
same
thing
why
not
the
same
thing
oh
surely
you
must
feel
it
it
would
be
almost
blasphemy
in
us
to
talk
as
paul
talked
it
is
much
easier
to
face
the
notion
or
the
fact
of
a
daemon
or
spirit
such
as
socrates
felt
to
be
in
him
than
to
face
what
paul
seems
to
be
meaning
yes
much
easier
the
only
question
is
whether
we
will
be
heathens
or
not
how
do
you
mean
said
tom
why
a
spirit
was
speaking
to
socrates
and
guiding
him
he
obeyed
the
guidance
but
knew
not
whence
it
came
a
spirit
is
striving
with
us
too
and
trying
to
guide
us
we
feel
that
just
as
much
as
he
did
do
we
know
what
spirit
it
is
whence
it
comes
will
we
obey
it
if
we
ca
name
it
know
no
more
of
it
then
he
knew
about
his
daemon
of
course
we
are
in
no
better
position
than
he
in
fact
heathens
tom
made
no
answer
and
after
a
slight
turn
or
two
more
hardy
said
let
us
go
in
and
they
went
to
his
rooms
when
the
candles
were
lighted
tom
saw
the
array
of
books
on
the
table
several
of
them
open
and
remembered
how
near
the
examinations
were
i
see
you
want
to
work
he
said
well
i
know
how
fellows
like
you
hate
being
thanked
there
you
need
wince
i
not
going
to
try
it
on
the
best
way
to
thank
you
i
know
is
to
go
straight
for
the
future
i
do
that
please
god
this
time
at
any
rate
now
what
ought
i
to
do
hardy
well
it
very
hard
to
say
i
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
this
last
few
days
since
i
felt
you
coming
round
but
i
make
up
my
mind
how
do
you
feel
yourself
what
your
own
instinct
about
it
of
course
i
must
break
it
all
off
at
once
completely
said
tom
mournfully
and
half
hoping
that
hardy
might
not
agree
with
him
of
course
answered
hardy
but
how
in
the
way
that
will
pain
her
least
i
would
sooner
lose
my
hand
or
bite
my
tongue
off
than
that
she
should
feel
lowered
or
lose
any
you
know
said
tom
looking
helplessly
at
his
friend
yes
that
all
right
you
must
take
all
you
can
on
your
own
shoulders
it
must
leave
a
sting
though
for
both
of
you
manage
how
you
will
but
i
ca
bear
to
let
her
think
i
do
care
for
her
i
need
do
that
i
ca
do
that
i
do
know
what
to
advise
however
i
believe
i
was
wrong
in
thinking
she
cared
for
you
so
much
she
will
be
hurt
of
course
she
ca
help
being
hurt
but
it
wo
be
so
bad
as
i
used
to
think
tom
made
no
answer
in
spite
of
all
his
good
resolutions
he
was
a
little
piqued
at
this
last
speech
hardy
went
on
presently
i
wish
she
were
well
out
of
oxford
it
a
bad
town
for
a
girl
to
be
living
in
especially
as
a
barmaid
in
a
place
which
we
haunt
i
do
know
that
she
will
take
much
harm
now
but
it
a
very
trying
thing
for
a
girl
of
that
sort
to
be
thrown
every
day
amongst
a
dozen
young
men
above
her
in
rank
and
not
one
in
ten
of
whom
has
any
manliness
about
him
how
do
you
mean
no
manliness
i
mean
that
a
girl
in
her
position
is
safe
with
us
if
we
had
any
manliness
in
us
she
would
be
you
ca
expect
all
men
to
be
blocks
of
ice
or
milksops
said
tom
who
was
getting
nettled
do
think
that
i
meant
you
said
hardy
indeed
i
did
but
surely
think
a
moment
is
it
a
proof
of
manliness
that
the
pure
and
weak
should
fear
you
and
shrink
from
you
which
is
the
true
aye
and
the
brave
man
he
who
trembles
before
a
woman
or
he
before
whom
a
woman
trembles
neither
said
tom
but
i
see
what
you
mean
and
when
you
put
it
that
way
it
clear
enough
but
you
wrong
in
saying
if
you
do
see
what
i
mean
tom
was
silent
can
there
be
any
true
manliness
without
purity
went
on
hardy
tom
drew
a
deep
breath
but
said
nothing
and
where
then
can
you
point
to
a
place
where
there
is
so
little
manliness
as
here
it
makes
my
blood
boil
to
see
what
one
must
see
every
day
there
are
a
set
of
men
up
here
and
have
been
ever
since
i
can
remember
the
place
not
one
of
whom
can
look
at
a
modest
woman
without
making
her
shudder
there
must
always
be
some
blackguards
said
tom
yes
but
unluckily
the
blackguards
set
the
fashion
and
give
the
tone
to
public
opinion
i
sure
both
of
us
have
seen
enough
to
know
perfectly
well
that
up
here
amongst
us
undergraduates
men
who
are
deliberately
and
avowedly
profligates
are
rather
admired
and
courted
are
said
to
know
the
world
and
all
that
while
a
man
who
tries
to
lead
a
pure
life
and
makes
no
secret
of
it
is
openly
sneered
at
by
them
looked
down
on
more
or
less
by
the
great
mass
of
men
and
to
use
the
word
you
used
just
now
thought
a
milksop
by
almost
all
i
do
think
it
so
bad
as
that
said
tom
there
are
many
men
who
would
respect
him
though
they
might
not
be
able
to
follow
him
of
course
i
never
meant
that
there
are
not
many
such
but
they
do
set
the
fashion
i
am
sure
i
right
let
us
try
it
by
the
best
test
have
you
and
i
in
our
secret
hearts
this
cursed
feeling
that
the
sort
of
man
we
are
talking
about
is
a
milksop
after
a
moment
thought
tom
answered
i
am
afraid
i
have
but
i
really
am
thoroughly
ashamed
of
it
now
hardy
but
you
it
if
you
had
it
you
could
never
have
spoken
to
me
as
you
have
i
beg
your
pardon
no
man
is
more
open
than
i
to
the
bad
influences
of
any
place
he
lives
in
god
knows
i
am
even
as
other
men
and
worse
for
i
have
been
taught
ever
since
i
could
speak
that
the
crown
of
all
real
manliness
of
all
christian
manliness
is
purity
neither
of
the
two
spoke
for
some
minutes
then
hardy
looked
at
his
watch
past
eleven
he
said
i
must
do
some
work
well
brown
this
will
be
a
day
to
be
remembered
in
my
calendar
tom
wrung
his
hand
but
did
not
venture
to
reply
as
he
got
to
the
door
however
he
turned
back
and
said
do
you
think
i
ought
to
write
to
her
well
you
can
try
you
find
it
a
bitter
business
i
fear
i
try
then
good
night
tom
went
to
his
own
rooms
and
set
to
work
to
write
his
letter
and
certainly
found
it
as
difficult
and
unpleasant
a
task
as
he
had
ever
set
himself
to
work
upon
half
a
dozen
times
he
tore
up
sheet
after
sheet
of
his
attempts
and
got
up
and
walked
about
and
plunged
and
kicked
mentally
against
the
collar
and
traces
in
which
he
had
harnessed
himself
by
his
friend
help
trying
to
convince
himself
that
hardy
was
a
puritan
who
had
lived
quite
differently
from
other
men
and
knew
nothing
of
what
a
man
ought
to
do
in
a
case
like
this
that
after
all
very
little
harm
had
been
done
the
world
would
never
go
on
at
all
if
people
were
to
be
so
scrupulous
probably
not
another
man
in
the
college
except
grey
perhaps
would
think
anything
of
what
he
had
done
done
why
what
had
he
done
he
could
be
taking
it
more
seriously
if
he
had
ruined
her
at
this
point
he
managed
to
bring
himself
up
sharp
again
more
than
once
no
thanks
to
at
any
rate
that
she
is
ruined
had
i
any
pity
any
scruples
my
god
what
a
mean
selfish
rascal
i
have
been
and
then
he
sat
down
again
and
wrote
and
scratched
out
what
he
had
written
till
the
other
fit
came
on
and
something
of
the
same
process
had
to
be
gone
through
again
we
must
all
recognize
the
process
and
remember
many
occasions
on
which
we
have
had
to
put
bridle
and
bit
on
and
ride
ourselves
as
if
we
had
been
horses
or
mules
without
understanding
and
what
a
trying
business
it
was
as
bad
as
getting
a
young
colt
past
a
gipsy
encampment
in
a
narrow
lane
at
last
after
many
trials
tom
got
himself
well
in
hand
and
produced
something
which
seemed
to
satisfy
him
for
after
reading
it
three
or
four
times
he
put
it
in
a
cover
with
a
small
case
which
he
produced
from
his
desk
sealed
it
directed
it
and
then
went
to
bed
next
morning
after
chapel
he
joined
hardy
and
walked
to
his
rooms
with
him
and
after
a
few
words
on
indifferent
matters
said
well
i
wrote
my
letter
last
night
did
you
satisfy
yourself
yes
i
think
so
i
do
know
though
on
second
thoughts
it
was
very
tough
work
i
was
afraid
you
would
find
it
so
but
would
you
like
to
see
it
no
thank
you
i
suppose
my
father
will
be
here
directly
but
i
wish
you
would
read
it
through
said
tom
producing
a
copy
well
if
you
wish
it
i
suppose
i
must
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
do
any
good
hardy
took
the
letter
and
sat
down
and
tom
drew
a
chair
close
to
him
and
watched
his
face
while
he
read
it
is
best
for
us
both
that
i
should
not
see
you
any
more
at
least
at
present
i
feel
that
i
have
done
you
a
great
wrong
i
dare
not
say
much
to
you
for
fear
of
making
that
wrong
greater
i
can
not
i
need
not
tell
you
how
i
despise
myself
now
how
i
long
to
make
you
any
amends
in
my
power
if
ever
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
i
do
hope
that
nothing
which
has
passed
will
hinder
you
from
applying
to
me
you
will
not
believe
how
it
pains
me
to
write
this
how
should
you
i
do
deserve
that
you
should
believe
anything
i
say
i
must
seem
heartless
to
you
i
have
been
i
am
heartless
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
writing
i
shall
long
all
my
life
to
hear
good
news
of
you
i
do
ask
you
to
pardon
me
but
if
you
can
prevail
on
yourself
not
to
send
back
the
enclosed
and
will
keep
it
as
a
small
remembrance
of
one
who
is
deeply
sorry
for
the
wrong
he
has
done
you
but
who
can
not
and
will
not
say
he
is
sorry
he
ever
met
you
you
will
be
adding
another
to
the
many
kindnesses
which
i
have
to
thank
you
for
and
which
i
shall
never
forget
hardy
read
it
over
several
times
as
tom
watched
impatiently
unable
to
make
out
anything
from
his
face
what
do
you
think
you
do
think
there
anything
wrong
in
it
i
hope
no
indeed
my
dear
fellow
i
really
think
it
does
you
credit
i
do
know
what
else
you
could
have
said
very
well
only
only
what
could
you
have
made
it
a
little
shorter
no
i
could
but
you
do
mean
that
what
did
you
mean
by
that
why
i
do
think
this
letter
will
end
the
business
at
least
i
afraid
not
but
what
more
could
i
have
said
nothing
certainly
but
could
you
have
keep
a
little
quieter
it
difficult
to
get
the
right
word
a
little
cooler
perhaps
could
you
have
made
the
part
about
not
seeing
her
again
a
little
more
decided
but
you
said
i
need
pretend
i
did
care
for
her
did
i
yes
besides
it
would
have
been
a
lie
i
do
want
you
to
tell
a
lie
certainly
but
how
about
this
remembrance
that
you
speak
of
what
that
oh
nothing
only
a
little
locket
i
bought
for
her
with
some
of
your
hair
in
it
well
of
course
come
now
there
no
harm
in
that
no
no
harm
do
you
think
she
will
wear
it
how
can
i
tell
it
may
make
her
think
it
is
all
at
an
end
i
afraid
if
she
always
wears
your
hair
by
jove
you
too
bad
hardy
i
wish
you
had
had
to
write
it
yourself
it
all
very
easy
to
pull
my
letter
to
pieces
i
dare
say
but
i
did
want
to
read
it
remember
no
more
you
did
i
forgot
but
i
wish
you
would
just
write
down
now
what
you
would
have
said
yes
i
think
i
see
myself
at
it
by
the
way
of
course
you
have
sent
your
letter
yes
i
sent
it
off
before
chapel
i
thought
so
in
that
case
i
do
think
we
need
trouble
ourselves
further
with
the
form
of
the
document
oh
that
only
shirking
how
do
you
know
i
may
not
want
it
for
the
next
occasion
no
no
do
let
us
begin
laughing
about
it
a
man
never
ought
to
have
to
write
such
letters
twice
in
his
life
if
he
has
why
he
may
get
a
good
enough
precedent
for
the
second
out
of
the
letter
writer
so
you
wo
correct
my
copy
no
not
i
at
this
point
in
their
dialogue
captain
hardy
appeared
on
the
scene
and
the
party
went
off
to
drysdale
to
breakfast
captain
hardy
visit
to
ambrose
was
a
great
success
he
stayed
some
four
or
five
days
and
saw
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
and
enjoyed
it
all
in
a
sort
of
reverent
way
which
was
almost
comic
tom
devoted
himself
to
the
work
of
cicerone
and
did
his
best
to
do
the
work
thoroughly
oxford
was
a
sort
of
utopia
to
the
captain
who
was
resolutely
bent
on
seeing
nothing
but
beauty
and
learning
and
wisdom
within
the
precincts
of
the
university
on
one
or
two
occasions
his
faith
was
tried
sorely
by
the
sight
of
young
gentlemen
gracefully
apparelled
dawdling
along
two
together
in
low
easy
pony
carriages
or
lying
on
their
backs
in
punts
for
hours
smoking
with
not
even
a
by
them
to
pass
the
time
dawdling
and
doing
nothing
were
the
objects
of
his
special
abhorrence
but
with
this
trifling
exception
the
captain
continued
steadily
to
behold
towers
and
quadrangles
and
chapels
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
colleges
through
spectacles
his
respect
for
a
regular
education
and
for
the
seat
of
learning
at
which
it
was
dispensed
was
so
strong
that
he
invested
not
only
the
tutors
doctors
and
proctors
of
whom
he
saw
little
except
at
a
distance
but
even
the
most
undergraduate
whose
acquaintance
he
made
with
a
sort
of
fancy
halo
of
scientific
knowledge
and
often
talked
to
those
youths
in
a
way
which
was
curiously
bewildering
and
embarrassing
to
them
drysdale
was
particularly
hit
by
it
he
had
humour
and
honesty
enough
himself
to
appreciate
the
captain
but
it
was
a
constant
puzzle
to
him
to
know
what
to
make
of
it
all
he
a
regular
old
brick
is
the
captain
he
said
to
tom
on
the
last
evening
of
the
old
gentleman
visit
but
by
jove
i
ca
help
thinking
he
must
be
poking
fun
at
us
half
his
time
it
is
rather
too
rich
to
hear
him
talking
on
as
if
we
were
all
as
fond
of
greek
as
he
seems
to
be
and
as
if
no
man
ever
got
drunk
up
here
i
declare
i
think
he
believes
it
said
tom
you
see
we
all
careful
enough
before
him
that
son
of
his
too
must
be
a
good
fellow
do
you
see
he
can
never
have
peached
his
father
was
telling
me
last
night
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
him
to
see
that
jack
poverty
had
been
no
drawback
to
him
he
had
always
told
him
it
would
be
so
amongst
english
gentlemen
and
now
he
found
him
living
quietly
and
independently
and
yet
on
equal
terms
and
friends
with
men
far
above
him
in
rank
and
fortune
you
sir
the
old
boy
said
by
jove
brown
i
felt
devilish
foolish
i
believe
i
blushed
and
it
is
often
i
indulge
in
that
sort
of
luxury
if
i
ashamed
of
doing
it
now
i
should
try
to
make
friends
with
hardy
but
i
do
know
how
to
face
him
and
i
doubt
whether
he
think
me
too
much
of
a
rip
to
be
intimate
with
tom
at
his
own
special
request
attended
the
departure
and
took
his
seat
opposite
to
him
and
his
son
at
the
back
of
the
southampton
coach
to
accompany
him
a
few
miles
out
of
oxford
for
the
first
mile
the
captain
was
full
of
the
pleasures
of
his
visit
and
of
invitations
to
tom
to
come
and
see
them
in
the
vacation
if
he
did
not
mind
homely
quarters
he
would
find
a
hearty
welcome
and
there
was
no
finer
bathing
or
boating
place
on
the
coast
if
he
liked
to
bring
his
gun
there
were
plenty
of
and
in
the
caves
at
the
point
tom
protested
with
the
greatest
sincerity
that
there
was
nothing
he
should
enjoy
so
much
then
the
young
men
got
down
to
walk
up
bagley
hill
and
when
they
mounted
again
found
the
captain
with
a
large
leather
case
in
his
hand
out
of
which
he
took
two
notes
and
began
pressing
them
on
his
son
while
tom
tried
to
look
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
for
some
time
hardy
steadily
refused
and
the
contention
became
animated
and
it
was
useless
to
pretend
any
longer
not
to
hear
why
jack
you
not
too
proud
i
hope
to
take
a
present
from
you
own
father
the
captain
said
at
last
but
my
dear
father
i
do
want
the
money
you
make
me
a
very
good
allowance
already
now
jack
just
listen
to
me
and
be
reasonable
you
know
a
great
many
of
your
friends
have
been
very
hospitable
to
me
i
could
not
return
their
hospitality
myself
but
i
wish
you
to
do
so
for
me
well
father
i
can
do
that
without
this
money
now
jack
said
the
captain
pushing
forward
the
notes
again
i
insist
on
your
taking
them
you
will
pain
me
very
much
if
you
do
take
them
so
the
son
took
the
notes
at
last
looking
as
most
men
of
his
age
would
if
they
had
just
lost
them
while
the
father
face
was
radiant
as
he
replaced
his
pocket
book
in
the
breast
pocket
inside
his
coat
his
eye
caught
tom
in
the
midst
of
the
operation
and
the
latter
could
not
help
looking
a
little
confused
as
if
he
had
been
unintentionally
obtruding
on
their
privacy
but
the
captain
at
once
laid
his
hand
on
his
knee
and
said
a
young
fellow
is
never
the
worse
for
having
a
note
to
veer
and
haul
on
eh
mr
brown
no
indeed
sir
a
great
deal
better
i
think
said
tom
and
was
quite
comfortable
again
the
captain
had
no
new
coat
that
summer
but
he
always
looked
like
a
gentleman
soon
the
coach
stopped
to
take
up
a
parcel
at
a
crossroad
and
the
young
men
got
down
they
stood
watching
it
until
it
disappeared
round
a
corner
of
the
road
and
then
turned
back
towards
oxford
and
struck
into
bagley
wood
hardy
listening
with
evident
pleasure
to
his
friend
enthusiastic
praise
of
his
father
but
he
was
not
in
a
talking
humour
and
they
were
soon
walking
along
together
in
silence
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
alone
together
since
the
morning
after
their
reconciliation
so
presently
tom
seized
the
occasion
to
recur
to
the
subject
which
was
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
she
has
never
answered
my
letter
he
began
abruptly
i
am
very
glad
of
it
said
hardy
but
why
because
you
know
you
want
it
all
broken
off
completely
yes
but
still
she
might
have
just
acknowledged
it
you
know
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
keep
away
from
the
place
my
dear
fellow
i
know
it
must
be
hard
work
but
you
are
doing
the
right
thing
yes
i
hope
so
said
tom
with
a
sigh
i
have
been
within
a
hundred
yards
of
choughs
this
five
days
the
old
lady
must
think
it
so
odd
hardy
made
no
reply
what
could
he
say
but
that
no
doubt
she
did
would
you
mind
doing
me
a
great
favor
said
tom
after
a
minute
anything
i
can
what
is
it
why
just
to
step
round
on
our
way
back
i
will
stay
as
far
off
as
you
like
and
see
how
things
are
going
on
how
she
is
very
well
do
you
like
this
view
of
oxford
i
always
think
it
is
the
best
of
them
all
no
you
do
see
anything
of
half
the
colleges
said
tom
who
was
very
loath
to
leave
the
other
subject
for
the
picturesque
but
you
get
all
the
spires
and
towers
so
well
and
the
river
in
the
foreground
look
at
that
shadow
of
a
cloud
skimming
over
christchurch
meadow
it
a
splendid
old
place
after
all
it
may
be
from
a
distance
to
an
outsider
said
tom
but
i
do
know
it
an
awfully
chilly
deadening
kind
of
place
to
live
in
there
something
in
the
life
of
the
place
that
sits
on
me
like
a
weight
and
makes
me
feel
dreary
how
long
have
you
felt
that
you
coming
out
in
a
new
line
i
wish
i
were
i
want
a
new
line
i
do
care
a
straw
for
cricket
i
hardly
like
pulling
and
as
for
those
wine
parties
day
after
day
and
suppers
night
after
night
they
turn
me
sick
to
think
of
you
have
the
remedy
in
your
own
hands
at
any
rate
said
hardy
smiling
how
do
you
mean
why
you
need
go
to
them
oh
one
ca
help
going
to
them
what
else
is
there
to
do
tom
waited
for
an
answer
but
his
companion
only
nodded
to
show
that
he
was
listening
as
he
strolled
on
down
the
path
looking
at
the
view
i
can
say
what
i
feel
to
you
hardy
i
always
have
been
able
and
it
such
a
comfort
to
me
now
it
was
you
who
put
these
sort
of
thoughts
into
my
head
too
so
you
ought
to
sympathize
with
me
i
do
my
dear
fellow
but
you
be
all
right
again
in
a
few
days
do
you
believe
it
it
is
only
what
you
seem
to
think
hardy
you
do
know
me
so
well
as
i
do
you
after
all
no
not
just
and
hipped
because
i
ca
go
and
see
her
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
i
dare
say
but
it
the
sort
of
selfish
life
we
lead
here
that
i
ca
stand
a
man
is
meant
to
live
only
with
fellows
like
himself
with
good
allowances
paid
quarterly
and
no
care
but
how
to
amuse
themselves
one
is
old
enough
for
something
better
than
that
sure
no
doubt
said
hardy
with
provoking
taciturnity
and
the
moment
one
tries
to
break
through
it
one
only
gets
into
trouble
yes
there
a
good
deal
of
danger
of
that
certainly
said
hardy
do
you
often
long
to
be
in
contact
with
some
of
the
realities
of
life
with
men
and
women
who
have
their
bread
and
butter
already
cut
for
them
how
can
a
place
be
a
university
where
no
one
can
come
up
who
has
two
hundred
a
year
or
so
to
live
on
you
ought
to
have
been
at
oxford
four
hundred
years
ago
when
there
were
more
thousands
here
than
we
have
hundreds
i
do
see
that
it
must
have
been
ten
times
as
bad
then
not
at
all
but
it
must
have
been
a
very
different
state
of
things
from
ours
they
must
have
been
almost
all
poor
scholars
who
worked
for
their
living
or
lived
on
next
to
nothing
how
do
you
really
suppose
they
lived
though
oh
i
do
know
but
how
should
you
like
it
now
if
we
had
fifty
poor
scholars
at
ambrose
besides
us
servitors
say
ten
tailors
ten
shoemakers
and
so
on
who
came
up
from
love
of
learning
and
attended
all
the
lectures
with
us
and
worked
for
the
present
undergraduates
while
they
were
hunting
and
cricketing
and
boating
well
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
at
any
rate
we
should
save
in
tailors
bills
even
if
we
did
get
our
coats
so
well
built
said
hardy
laughing
well
brown
you
have
a
most
catholic
taste
and
capacity
for
talking
in
new
truths
all
the
elements
of
a
good
radical
in
you
i
tell
you
i
hate
radicals
said
tom
indignantly
well
here
we
are
in
the
town
i
go
round
by
and
catch
you
up
before
you
get
to
high
street
tom
left
to
himself
walked
slowly
on
for
a
little
way
and
then
quickly
back
again
in
an
impatient
restless
manner
and
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
corner
where
they
had
parted
when
hardy
appeared
again
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
something
had
happened
what
is
it
she
is
not
ill
he
said
quickly
no
quite
well
her
aunt
says
you
did
see
her
then
no
the
fact
is
she
has
gone
home
chapter
xxiii
the
englebourn
constable
on
the
afternoon
of
a
splendid
day
in
the
early
part
of
june
some
four
or
five
days
after
the
sunday
on
which
the
morning
service
at
englebourn
was
interrupted
by
the
fire
at
farmer
groves
david
johnson
tailor
and
constable
of
the
parish
was
sitting
at
his
work
in
a
small
erection
half
shed
half
which
leaned
against
the
back
of
his
cottage
not
that
david
had
not
a
regular
workshop
with
a
window
looking
into
the
village
street
and
a
regular
counter
close
under
it
on
which
passersby
might
see
him
stitching
and
from
which
he
could
gossip
with
them
easily
as
was
his
wont
but
although
the
constable
kept
the
king
peace
and
made
garments
of
all
kinds
for
his
livelihood
from
the
curate
frock
down
to
the
ploughboy
fustians
he
was
addicted
for
his
pleasure
and
solace
to
the
keeping
of
bees
the
constable
bees
inhabited
a
row
of
hives
in
the
narrow
strip
of
garden
which
ran
away
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
this
strip
of
garden
was
bordered
along
the
whole
of
one
side
by
the
rector
premises
now
honest
david
loved
gossip
well
and
considered
it
a
part
of
his
duty
as
constable
to
be
well
up
in
all
events
and
rumours
which
happened
or
arose
within
his
liberties
but
he
loved
his
bees
better
than
gossip
and
as
he
was
now
in
hourly
expectation
that
they
would
be
swarming
was
working
as
has
been
said
in
his
that
he
might
be
at
hand
at
the
critical
moment
the
rough
table
on
which
he
was
seated
commanded
a
view
of
the
hives
his
big
scissors
and
some
shreds
of
velveteen
lay
near
him
on
the
table
also
the
key
and
an
old
shovel
of
which
the
uses
will
appear
presently
on
his
knees
lay
the
black
velveteen
coat
the
sunday
garment
of
harry
winburn
to
which
he
was
fitting
new
sleeves
in
his
exertions
at
the
top
of
the
chimney
in
putting
out
the
fire
harry
had
grievously
damaged
the
garment
in
question
the
farmer
had
presented
him
with
five
shillings
on
the
occasion
which
sum
was
quite
inadequate
to
the
purchase
of
a
new
coat
and
harry
being
too
proud
to
call
the
farmer
attention
to
the
special
damage
which
he
had
suffered
in
his
service
had
contented
himself
with
bringing
his
old
coat
to
be
new
sleeved
harry
was
a
favorite
with
the
constable
on
account
of
his
intelligence
and
independence
and
because
of
his
relations
with
the
farmers
of
englebourn
on
the
allotment
question
although
by
his
office
the
representative
of
law
and
order
in
the
parish
david
was
a
man
of
the
people
and
sympathized
with
the
peasantry
more
than
with
the
farmers
he
had
passed
some
years
of
his
apprenticeship
at
reading
where
he
had
picked
up
notions
on
political
and
social
questions
much
ahead
of
the
englebourn
worthies
when
he
returned
to
his
native
village
being
a
wise
man
he
had
kept
his
new
lights
in
the
background
and
consequently
had
succeeded
in
the
object
of
his
ambition
and
had
been
appointed
constable
his
reason
for
seeking
the
post
was
a
desire
to
prove
that
the
old
joke
as
to
the
manliness
of
tailors
had
no
application
to
his
case
and
this
he
had
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
the
neighborhood
by
the
resolute
manner
in
which
whenever
called
on
he
performed
his
duties
and
now
that
his
character
was
made
and
his
position
secure
he
was
not
so
careful
of
betraying
his
leanings
and
had
lost
some
custom
amongst
the
farmers
in
consequence
of
them
the
job
on
which
he
was
employed
naturally
turned
his
thoughts
to
harry
he
stitched
away
now
weighing
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
not
go
himself
to
farmer
groves
and
represent
to
him
that
he
ought
to
give
harry
a
new
coat
now
rejoicing
over
the
fact
that
the
rector
had
decided
to
let
harry
have
another
acre
of
the
allotment
land
now
speculating
on
the
attachment
of
his
favorite
to
the
gardener
daughter
and
whether
he
could
do
any
thing
to
forward
his
suit
in
the
pursuit
of
which
thoughts
he
had
forgotten
all
about
his
bees
when
suddenly
a
great
humming
arose
followed
by
a
rush
through
the
air
like
the
passing
of
an
express
train
which
recalled
him
to
himself
he
jumped
from
the
table
casting
aside
the
coat
and
seizing
the
key
and
shovel
hurried
out
into
the
garden
beating
the
two
together
with
all
his
might
the
process
in
question
known
in
country
phrase
as
tanging
is
founded
upon
the
belief
that
the
bees
will
not
settle
unless
under
the
influence
of
this
peculiar
music
and
the
constable
holding
faithfully
to
the
popular
belief
rushed
down
his
garden
tanging
as
though
his
life
depended
upon
it
in
the
hopes
that
the
soothing
sound
would
induce
the
swarm
to
settle
at
once
on
his
own
apple
trees
is
tanging
a
superstition
or
not
people
learned
in
bees
ought
to
know
but
i
never
happened
to
meet
one
who
had
settled
the
question
it
is
curious
how
such
beliefs
or
superstitions
fix
themselves
in
the
popular
mind
of
a
countryside
and
are
held
by
wise
and
simple
alike
david
the
constable
was
a
most
sensible
and
man
of
his
time
and
class
but
kemble
or
akerman
or
other
learned
scholars
would
have
vainly
explained
to
him
that
tang
is
but
the
old
word
for
to
hold
and
that
the
object
of
tanging
is
not
to
lure
the
bees
with
sweet
music
of
key
and
shovel
but
to
give
notice
to
the
neighbours
that
they
have
swarmed
and
that
the
owner
of
the
maternal
hive
means
to
hold
on
to
his
right
to
the
emigrants
david
would
have
listened
to
the
lecture
with
pity
and
have
retained
unshaken
belief
in
his
music
in
the
present
case
however
the
tanging
was
of
little
avail
for
the
swarm
after
wheeling
once
or
twice
in
the
air
disappeared
from
the
eyes
of
the
constable
over
the
wall
he
went
on
tanging
violently
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
paused
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
should
he
get
over
the
wall
into
the
rector
garden
at
once
or
should
he
go
round
and
ask
leave
to
carry
his
search
into
the
parsonage
grounds
as
a
man
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
following
straight
at
once
over
wall
and
fence
but
the
constable
was
also
strong
within
him
he
was
not
on
the
best
of
terms
with
old
simon
the
rector
gardener
and
his
late
opposition
to
miss
winter
in
the
matter
of
the
singing
also
came
into
his
mind
so
he
resolved
that
the
parish
constable
would
lose
caste
by
disregarding
his
neighbour
boundaries
and
was
considering
what
to
do
next
when
he
heard
a
footstep
and
short
cough
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
which
he
recognized
be
you
there
maester
simon
he
called
out
where
upon
the
walker
on
the
other
side
pulled
up
and
after
a
second
appeal
answered
shortly
seed
ought
o
my
bees
thaay
a
bin
and
riz
and
gone
off
somweres
athert
the
wall
i
seen

exclaimed
the

i
knowd

thaay
wur
yourn
zoon
as

i
sot
eyes
on
old
simon
went
on
how
know
then
asked
the
constable
thine
be
aal
zettin
said
simon
with
a
chuckle
thee
medst
cum
and
pick
all
out
if
a
mind
to
simon
was
mollified
by
his
own
joke
and
broke
into
a
short
dry
cachinnation
half
laugh
half
cough
while
the
constable
who
was
pleased
and
astonished
to
find
his
neighbour
in
such
a
good
humour
hastened
to
get
an
empty
hive
and
a
pair
of
gloves
fortified
with
which
he
left
his
cottage
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
up
street
towards
the
rectory
gate
hard
by
which
stood
simon
cottage
the
old
gardener
was
of
an
impatient
nature
and
the
effect
of
the
joke
had
almost
time
to
evaporate
and
simon
was
fast
relapsing
into
his
usual
state
of
mind
towards
his
neighbour
before
the
latter
made
his
appearance
wher
hast
been
so
long
he
exclaimed
when
the
constable
joined
him
i
seed
the
young
missus
and
young
lady
a
talkin
afore
the
door
said
david
so
i
stopped
back

simon
it
may
be
said
by
the
way
had
obstinately
refused
to
take
any
medicine
since
his
fall
and
had
maintained
a
constant
war
on
the
subject
both
with
his
own
women
and
miss
winter
whom
he
had
impressed
more
than
ever
with
a
belief
in
his
wrongheadedness
ah

david

david
we

young

lissom
as
we
was
maester
simon
to
which
remark
simon
replied
by
a
grunt
he
disliked
allusions
to
his
age
a
rare
dislike
amongst
his
class
in
that
part
of
the
country
most
of
the
people
are
fond
of
making
themselves
out
older
than
they
are
and
love
to
dwell
on
their
experiences
and
believe
as
firmly
as
the
rest
of
us
that
everything
has
altered
for
the
worse
in
the
parish
and
district
since
their
youth
but
simon
though
short
of
words
and
temper
and
an
uncomfortable
acquaintance
in
consequence
was
inclined
to
be
helpful
enough
in
other
ways
the
constable
with
his
assistance
had
very
soon
hived
his
swarm
of
bees
then
the
constable
insisted
on
simon
coming
with
him
and
taking
a
glass
of
ale
which
after
a
little
coquetting
simon
consented
to
do
so
after
carrying
his
safely
home
and
erecting
the
hive
on
a
stand
of
his
own
workmanship
he
hastened
to
rejoin
simon
and
the
two
soon
found
themselves
in
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
the
constable
wished
to
make
the
most
of
this
opportunity
and
so
began
at
once
to
pump
simon
as
to
his
intentions
with
regard
to
his
daughter
but
simon
was
not
easy
to
lead
in
anyway
whatever
and
seemed
in
a
more
than
usually
line
about
his
daughter
whether
he
had
anyone
in
his
eye
for
her
or
not
david
could
not
make
out
but
one
thing
he
did
make
out
and
it
grieved
him
much
old
simon
was
in
a
touchy
and
unfriendly
state
of
mind
against
harry
who
he
said
was
falling
into
bad
ways
and
beginning
to
think
much
too
much
of
his
self
why
was
he
to
be
wanting
more
allotment
ground
than
anyone
else
simon
had
himself
given
harry
some
advice
on
the
point
but
not
to
much
purpose
it
would
seem
as
he
summed
up
his
notions
on
the
subject
by
the
remark
that
was
waste
of
soap
to
lather
an
ass
the
constable
now
and
then
made
a
stand
for
his
young
friend
but
very
judiciously
and
after
feeling
his
way
for
some
time
he
came
to
the
conclusion
as
indeed
the
truth
was
that
simon
was
jealous
of
harry
talent
for
growing
flowers
and
had
been
driven
into
his
present
frame
of
mind
at
hearing
miss
winter
and
her
cousin
talking
about
the
flowers
at
dame
winburn
under
his
very
nose
for
the
last
four
or
five
days
they
had
spoken
thus
to
interest
the
old
man
meaning
to
praise
harry
to
him
the
fact
was
that
the
old
gardener
was
one
of
those
men
who
never
can
stand
hearing
other
people
praised
and
think
that
all
such
praise
must
be
meant
in
depreciation
of
themselves
when
they
had
finished
their
ale
the
afternoon
was
getting
on
and
the
constable
rose
to
go
back
to
his
work
while
old
simon
declared
his
intention
of
going
down
to
the
to
see
how
the
mowing
was
getting
on
he
was
sure
that
the
hay
would
never
be
made
properly
now
that
he
could
be
about
as
much
as
usual
in
another
hour
the
coat
was
finished
and
the
constable
being
uneasy
in
his
mind
resolved
to
carry
the
garment
home
himself
at
once
and
to
have
a
talk
with
dame
winburn
so
he
wrapped
the
coat
in
a
handkerchief
put
it
under
his
arm
and
set
off
down
the
village
he
found
the
dame
busy
with
her
washing
and
after
depositing
his
parcel
sat
down
on
the
settle
to
have
a
talk
with
her
they
soon
got
on
the
subject
which
was
always
uppermost
in
her
mind
her
son
prospects
and
she
poured
out
to
the
constable
her
troubles
first
there
was
this
after
old
daughter
not
that
dame
winburn
was
going
to
say
anything
against
her
though
she
might
have
her
thoughts
as
well
as
other
folk
and
for
her
part
she
liked
to
see
girls
that
were
fit
for
something
besides
dressing
themselves
up
like
their
betters
but
what
worried
her
was
to
see
how
harry
took
it
to
heart
he
like
himself
and
she
could
see
how
it
was
all
to
end
it
made
him
fractious
too
and
he
was
getting
into
trouble
about
his
work
he
had
left
his
regular
place
and
was
gone
mowing
with
a
gang
most
of
them
men
out
of
the
parish
that
she
knew
nothing
about
and
likely
not
to
be
the
best
of
company
and
it
was
all
very
well
in
harvest
time
when
they
could
go
and
earn
good
wages
at
mowing
and
reaping
any
where
about
and
no
man
could
earn
better
than
her
harry
but
when
it
came
to
winter
again
she
did
see
but
what
he
might
find
the
want
of
a
regular
place
and
then
the
farmers
might
take
him
on
and
his
own
land
that
he
had
got
and
seemed
to
think
so
much
of
might
turn
out
all
he
thought
it
would
and
so
in
fact
the
old
lady
was
troubled
in
her
mind
and
only
made
the
constable
more
uneasy
he
had
a
vague
sort
of
impression
that
he
was
in
some
way
answerable
for
harry
who
was
a
good
deal
with
him
and
was
fond
of
coming
about
his
place
and
although
his
cottage
happened
to
be
next
to
old
simon
which
might
account
for
the
fact
to
some
extent
yet
the
constable
was
conscious
of
having
talked
to
his
young
friend
on
many
matters
in
a
way
which
might
have
unsettled
him
and
encouraged
his
natural
tendency
to
stand
up
for
his
own
rights
and
independence
and
he
knew
well
enough
that
this
temper
was
not
the
one
which
was
likely
to
keep
a
labouring
man
out
of
trouble
in
the
parish
he
did
not
allow
his
own
misgivings
however
to
add
to
the
widow
troubles
but
on
the
contrary
cheered
her
by
praising
up
harry
as
much
as
even
she
could
desire
and
prophesying
that
all
would
come
right
and
that
those
that
lived
would
see
her
son
as
respected
as
any
man
in
the
parish
he
should
be
surprised
indeed
if
he
were
before
he
died
and
then
astonished
at
his
own
boldness
and
feeling
that
he
was
not
capable
of
any
higher
flight
of
imagination
the
constable
rose
to
take
his
leave
he
asked
where
harry
was
working
and
finding
that
he
was
at
mowing
in
the
danes
close
set
off
to
look
after
him
the
constable
could
not
shake
off
the
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
happen
to
harry
which
would
get
him
into
trouble
and
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
as
yet
nothing
had
gone
wrong
whenever
one
has
this
sort
of
vague
feeling
about
a
friend
there
is
a
natural
and
irresistible
impulse
to
go
and
look
after
him
and
to
be
with
him
the
danes
close
was
a
part
of
the
glebe
a
large
field
of
some
ten
acres
or
so
in
extent
close
to
the
village
two
footpaths
ran
across
it
so
that
it
was
almost
common
property
and
the
village
children
considered
it
as
much
their
playground
as
the
green
itself
they
trampled
the
grass
a
good
deal
more
than
seemed
endurable
in
the
eyes
of
simon
who
managed
the
farming
operations
as
well
as
the
garden
but
the
children
had
their
own
way
notwithstanding
the
threats
he
sometimes
launched
at
them
miss
winter
would
have
sooner
lost
all
the
hay
than
have
narrowed
their
amusements
it
was
the
most
difficult
piece
of
mowing
in
the
parish
in
consequence
of
the
tramplings
and
of
the
large
crops
it
bore
the
danes
or
some
other
unknown
persons
had
made
the
land
fat
perhaps
with
their
carcasses
and
the
benefit
had
lasted
to
the
time
of
our
story
at
any
rate
the
field
bore
splendid
crops
and
the
mowers
always
got
an
extra
shilling
an
acre
for
cutting
it
by
miss
winter
special
order
which
was
paid
by
simon
in
the
most
ungracious
manner
and
with
many
grumblings
that
it
was
enough
to
ruin
all
the
mowers
in
the
countryside
as
the
constable
got
over
the
stile
into
the
a
great
part
of
his
misgivings
passed
out
of
his
head
he
was
a
simple
kindly
man
whose
heart
lay
open
to
all
influences
of
scene
and
weather
and
the
danes
close
full
of
life
and
joy
and
merry
sounds
as
seen
under
the
slanting
rays
of
the
evening
sun
was
just
the
place
to
rub
all
the
wrinkles
out
of
him
the
constable
however
is
not
singular
in
this
matter
what
man
amongst
us
all
if
he
will
think
the
matter
over
calmly
and
fairly
can
honestly
say
that
there
is
any
one
spot
on
the
earth
surface
in
which
he
has
enjoyed
so
much
real
wholesome
happy
life
as
in
a
hay
field
he
may
have
won
renown
on
horseback
or
on
foot
at
the
sports
and
pastimes
in
which
englishmen
glory
he
may
have
shaken
off
all
rivals
time
after
time
across
the
vales
of
aylesbury
or
of
berks
or
any
other
of
our
famous
hunting
counties
he
may
have
stalked
the
oldest
and
shyest
buck
in
scotch
forests
and
killed
the
biggest
salmon
of
the
year
in
the
tweed
and
the
trout
in
the
thames
he
may
have
made
topping
averages
in
matches
of
cricket
or
have
made
long
and
perilous
marches
dear
to
memory
over
boggy
moor
or
mountain
or
glacier
he
may
have
successfully
attended
many
within
drive
of
mayfair
on
velvet
lawns
surrounded
by
all
the
fairyland
of
pomp
and
beauty
and
luxury
which
london
can
pour
out
he
may
have
shone
at
private
theatricals
and
his
voice
may
have
sounded
over
hushed
audiences
at
stephen
or
in
the
law
courts
or
he
may
have
had
good
times
in
any
other
scenes
of
pleasure
or
triumph
open
to
englishmen
but
i
much
doubt
whether
on
putting
his
recollections
fairly
and
quietly
together
he
would
not
say
at
last
that
the
fresh
mown
hay
field
is
the
place
where
he
has
spent
the
most
hours
which
he
would
like
to
live
over
again
the
fewest
which
he
would
wish
to
forget
as
children
we
stumble
about
the
hay
revelling
in
the
many
colors
of
the
prostrate
grass
and
wild
flowers
and
in
the
power
of
tumbling
where
we
please
without
hurting
ourselves
as
small
boys
we
pelt
one
another
and
the
village
schoolgirls
and
our
nursemaids
and
young
lady
cousins
with
the
hay
till
hot
and
weary
we
retire
to
tea
or
syllabub
beneath
the
shade
of
some
great
oak
or
elm
standing
up
like
a
monarch
out
of
the
fair
pasture
or
following
the
mowers
we
rush
with
eagerness
on
the
treasures
disclosed
by
the
the
nest
of
the
unhappy
late
laying
titlark
or
careless
as
big
boys
we
toil
ambitiously
with
the
spare
forks
and
rakes
or
climb
into
the
wagons
and
receive
with
open
arms
the
delicious
load
as
it
is
pitched
up
from
below
and
rises
higher
and
higher
as
we
pass
along
the
long
lines
of
haycocks
a
year
or
two
later
we
are
strolling
there
with
our
first
sweethearts
our
souls
and
tongues
loaded
with
sweet
thoughts
and
soft
speeches
we
take
a
turn
with
the
scythe
as
the
bronzed
mowers
lie
in
the
shade
for
their
short
rest
and
willingly
pay
our
footing
for
the
feat
again
we
come
back
with
book
in
pocket
and
our
own
children
tumbling
about
as
we
did
before
them
now
romping
with
them
and
smothering
them
with
the
load
now
musing
and
reading
and
dozing
away
the
delicious
summer
evenings
and
so
shall
we
not
come
back
to
the
end
enjoying
as
grandfathers
the
lovemaking
and
the
rompings
of
younger
generations
yet
were
any
of
us
ever
really
disappointed
or
melancholy
in
a
did
we
ever
lie
fairly
back
on
a
haycock
and
look
up
into
the
blue
sky
and
listen
to
the
merry
sounds
the
whetting
of
scythes
and
the
laughing
prattle
of
women
and
children
and
think
evil
thoughts
of
the
world
and
of
or
our
brethren
not
we
or
if
we
have
so
done
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
and
deserve
never
to
be
out
of
town
again
during
there
is
something
in
the
sights
and
sounds
of
a
which
seems
to
touch
the
same
chord
in
one
as
lowell
lines
in
the
lay
of
sir
launfal
which
end
for
a
cap
and
bells
our
lives
we
pay
we
wear
out
our
lives
with
toiling
and
tasking
it
is
only
heaven
that
is
given
away
it
is
only
god
may
be
had
for
the
asking
there
is
no
price
set
on
the
lavish
summer
and
june
may
be
had
by
the
poorest
comer
but
the
philosophy
of
the
remains
to
be
written
let
us
hope
that
whoever
takes
the
subject
in
hand
will
not
dissipate
all
its
sweetness
in
the
process
of
the
inquiry
wherein
the
charm
lies
the
constable
had
not
the
slightest
notion
of
speculating
on
his
own
sensations
but
was
very
glad
nevertheless
to
find
his
spirits
rising
as
he
stepped
into
the
danes
close
all
the
hay
was
down
except
a
small
piece
in
the
further
corner
which
the
mowers
were
upon
there
were
groups
of
children
in
many
parts
of
the
field
and
women
to
look
after
them
mostly
sitting
on
the
fresh
swarth
working
and
gossiping
while
the
little
ones
played
about
he
had
not
gone
twenty
yards
before
he
was
stopped
by
the
violent
crying
of
a
child
and
turning
toward
the
voice
he
saw
a
little
girl
of
six
or
seven
who
had
strayed
from
her
mother
scrambling
out
of
the
ditch
and
wringing
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
pain
and
terror
the
poor
little
thing
had
fallen
into
a
bed
of
nettles
and
was
very
much
frightened
and
not
a
little
hurt
the
constable
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
soothing
her
as
well
as
he
could
and
hurrying
along
till
he
found
some
sat
down
with
her
on
his
knee
and
rubbed
her
hands
with
the
leaves
repeating
the
old
saw
our
nettle
in
dock
dock
shall
a
new
smock
nettle
ha
narrun
what
with
the
rubbing
and
the
constable
kind
manner
and
listening
to
the
doggerel
rhyme
and
feeling
that
nettle
would
get
her
deserts
the
little
thing
soon
ceased
crying
but
several
groups
had
been
drawn
towards
the
place
and
amongst
the
rest
came
miss
winter
and
her
cousin
who
had
been
within
hearing
of
the
disaster
the
constable
began
to
feel
very
nervous
and
uncomfortable
when
he
looked
up
from
his
charitable
occupation
and
suddenly
found
the
rector
daughter
close
to
him
but
his
nervousness
was
uncalled
for
the
sight
of
what
he
was
about
and
of
the
tender
way
in
which
he
was
handling
the
child
drove
all
remembrance
of
his
heresies
and
contumaciousness
in
the
matter
of
psalmody
out
of
her
head
she
greeted
him
with
frankness
and
cordiality
and
presently
when
he
had
given
up
his
charge
to
the
mother
who
was
inclined
at
first
to
be
hard
with
the
poor
little
sobbing
truant
came
up
and
said
she
wished
to
speak
a
few
words
to
him
david
was
highly
delighted
at
miss
winter
manner
but
he
walked
along
at
her
side
not
quite
comfortable
in
his
mind
for
fear
lest
she
should
start
the
old
subject
of
dispute
and
then
his
duty
as
a
public
man
would
have
to
be
done
at
all
risk
of
offending
her
he
was
much
comforted
when
she
began
by
asking
him
whether
he
had
seen
much
of
widow
winburn
son
lately
david
admitted
that
he
generally
saw
him
every
day
did
he
know
that
he
had
left
his
place
and
had
quarrelled
with
tester
yes
david
knew
that
harry
had
had
words
with
farmer
tester
but
farmer
tester
was
a
sort
that
was
very
hard
not
to
have
words
with
still
it
is
very
bad
you
know
for
so
young
a
man
to
be
quarrelling
with
the
farmers
said
miss
winter
was
the
varmer
as
quarreled
wi
he
you
see
miss
david
answered
which
makes
all
the
odds
he
cum
to
harry
all
in
a
fluster
and
said
as
how
he
must
drow
up
the
land
as
he
or
he
place
one
or
on
and
so
you
see
miss
as
harry
wur
kind
o
druv
to
it
likely
as
he
wur
to
drow
up
the
land
now
as
he
were
just
reppin
the
benefit
ov
it
and
all
for
varmer
tester
place
wich
be
no
sich
gurt
things
miss
arter
all
very
likely
not
but
i
fear
it
may
hinder
his
getting
employment
the
other
farmers
will
not
take
him
on
now
if
they
can
help
it
no
thaay
falls
out
wi
one
another
bad
enough
and
calls
all
manner
o
names
but
thaay
ca
abide
a
poor
man
to
speak
his
mind
nor
take
his
own
part
not
one
on
said
david
looking
at
miss
winter
as
if
doubtful
how
she
might
take
his
strictures
but
she
went
on
without
any
show
of
dissent
i
shall
try
to
get
him
work
for
my
father
but
i
am
sorry
to
find
that
simon
does
not
seem
to
like
the
idea
of
taking
him
on
it
is
not
easy
always
to
make
out
simon
meaning
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
said
something
about
a
bleating
sheep
losing
a
bite
but
i
should
think
this
young
man
is
not
much
of
a
talker
in
general
she
paused
that
true
miss
said
david
energetically
there
ai
a
quieter
spoken
or
steadier
man
at
his
work
in
the
parish
i
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
miss
winter
and
i
hope
we
may
soon
do
something
for
him
but
what
i
want
you
to
do
just
now
is
to
speak
a
word
to
him
about
the
company
he
seems
to
be
getting
into
the
constable
looked
somewhat
aghast
at
this
speech
of
miss
winter
but
did
not
answer
not
knowing
to
what
she
was
alluding
she
saw
that
he
did
not
understand
and
went
on
he
is
mowing
with
a
gang
from
the
heath
and
the
next
parish
i
am
sure
they
are
very
bad
men
for
him
to
be
with
i
was
so
vexed
when
i
found
simon
had
given
them
the
job
but
he
said
they
would
get
it
all
down
in
a
day
and
be
done
with
it
and
that
was
all
he
cared
for
and
is
a
fine
day
work
miss
for
five
men
said
david
looking
over
the
field
and
is
good
work
too
you
mind
the
swarth
else
and
he
picked
up
a
handful
of
the
fallen
grass
to
show
her
how
near
the
ground
it
was
cut
oh
yes
i
have
no
doubt
they
are
very
good
mowers
but
they
are
not
good
men
i
sure
there
do
you
see
now
who
it
is
that
is
bringing
them
beer
i
hope
you
will
see
widow
winburn
son
and
speak
to
him
and
try
to
keep
him
out
of
bad
company
we
should
be
all
so
sorry
if
he
were
to
get
into
trouble
david
promised
to
do
his
best
and
miss
winter
wished
him
good
evening
and
rejoined
her
cousin
well
katie
will
he
do
your
behest
yes
indeed
and
i
think
he
is
the
best
person
to
do
it
widow
winburn
thinks
her
son
minds
him
more
than
any
one
do
you
know
i
do
think
it
will
ever
go
right
i
sure
she
does
care
the
least
for
him
oh
you
have
only
just
seen
her
once
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
then
that
wretched
old
simon
is
so
perverse
about
it
said
the
cousin
you
will
never
manage
him
he
is
very
provoking
certainly
but
i
get
my
own
way
generally
in
spite
of
him
and
it
is
such
a
perfect
plan
is
it
oh
charming
if
you
can
only
bring
it
about
now
we
must
be
really
going
home
papa
will
be
getting
restless
so
the
young
ladies
left
the
deep
in
for
harry
winburn
and
the
gardener
daughter
miss
winter
being
no
more
able
to
resist
a
tale
of
true
love
than
her
cousin
or
the
rest
of
her
sex
they
would
have
been
more
or
less
than
woman
if
they
had
not
taken
an
interest
in
so
absorbing
a
passion
as
poor
harry
by
the
time
they
reached
the
rectory
gate
they
had
installed
him
in
the
gardener
cottage
with
his
bride
and
mother
for
there
would
be
plenty
of
room
for
the
widow
and
it
would
be
so
convenient
to
have
the
laundry
close
at
hand
and
had
pentioned
old
simon
and
sent
him
and
his
old
wife
to
wrangle
away
the
rest
of
their
time
in
the
widow
cottage
is
a
delightful
and
harmless
exercise
meantime
david
the
constable
had
gone
towards
the
mowers
who
were
taking
a
short
rest
before
finishing
off
the
last
which
remained
standing
the
person
whose
appearance
had
so
horrified
miss
winter
was
drawing
beer
for
them
from
a
small
barrel
this
was
an
elderly
woman
with
a
skin
burnt
as
brown
as
that
of
any
of
the
mowers
she
wore
a
man
hat
and
spencer
and
had
a
strong
harsh
voice
and
altogether
was
not
a
prepossessing
person
she
went
by
the
name
of
daddy
cowell
in
the
parish
and
had
been
for
years
a
proscribed
person
she
lived
up
on
the
heath
often
worked
in
the
fields
took
in
lodgers
and
smoked
a
short
clay
pipe
these
eccentricities
when
added
to
her
clothing
were
quite
enough
to
account
for
the
sort
of
outlawry
in
which
she
lived
miss
winter
and
other
good
people
of
englebourn
believed
her
capable
of
any
crime
and
the
children
were
taught
to
stop
talking
and
playing
and
run
away
when
she
came
near
them
but
the
constable
who
had
had
one
or
two
to
execute
in
her
house
and
had
otherwise
had
frequent
occasions
of
getting
acquainted
with
her
in
the
course
of
his
duties
had
by
no
means
so
evil
an
opinion
of
her
he
had
never
seen
much
harm
in
her
he
had
often
been
heard
to
say
and
she
never
made
pretence
to
much
good
nevertheless
david
was
by
no
means
pleased
to
see
her
acting
as
purveyor
to
the
gang
which
harry
had
joined
he
knew
how
such
contact
would
damage
him
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
parochial
respectabilities
and
was
anxious
to
do
his
best
to
get
him
clear
of
it
with
these
views
he
went
up
to
the
men
who
were
resting
under
a
large
elm
tree
and
complimented
them
on
their
day
work
they
were
themselves
well
satisfied
with
it
and
with
one
another
when
men
have
had
sixteen
hours
or
so
hard
mowing
in
company
and
none
of
them
can
say
that
the
others
have
not
done
their
fair
share
they
are
apt
to
respect
one
another
more
at
the
end
of
it
it
was
harry
first
day
with
this
gang
who
were
famous
for
going
about
the
neighbourhood
and
doing
great
feats
in
hay
and
wheat
harvest
they
were
satisfied
with
him
and
he
with
them
none
the
less
so
probably
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
because
they
also
were
loose
on
the
world
servants
of
no
regular
master
it
was
a
bad
time
to
make
his
approaches
the
constable
saw
so
after
sitting
by
harry
until
the
gang
rose
to
finish
off
their
work
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
asking
him
to
come
round
by
his
cottage
on
his
way
home
which
harry
promised
to
do
he
walked
back
to
the
village
chapter
xxiv
the
schools
there
is
no
more
characteristic
spot
in
oxford
than
the
quadrangle
of
the
schools
doubtless
in
the
times
when
the
university
held
and
exercised
the
privileges
of
and
and
other
such
rights
there
must
have
been
a
place
somewhere
within
the
liberties
devoted
to
examinations
even
more
exciting
than
the
but
since
has
ceased
to
take
cognizance
of
treasons
insurrections
felonies
and
mayhem
it
is
here
in
that
fateful
and
inexorable
quadrangle
and
the
buildings
which
surround
it
that
she
exercises
her
most
potent
spells
over
the
spirits
of
her
children
i
suppose
that
a
man
being
tried
for
his
life
must
be
more
uncomfortable
than
an
undergraduate
being
examined
for
his
degree
and
that
to
be
hung
perhaps
even
to
be
pilloried
must
be
worse
than
to
be
plucked
but
after
all
the
feeling
in
both
cases
must
be
essentially
the
same
only
more
intense
in
the
former
and
an
institution
which
can
examine
a
man
literis
in
humanities
so
called
once
a
year
for
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
has
nothing
to
complain
of
though
it
has
no
longer
the
power
of
hanging
him
at
once
out
of
hand
the
schools
quadrangle
is
for
the
most
part
a
lonely
place
men
pass
through
the
melancholy
by
which
that
quadrangle
is
entered
on
three
sides
from
broad
street
from
the
ratcliff
and
from
new
when
necessity
leads
them
that
way
with
alert
step
and
silently
no
nursemaids
or
children
play
about
it
nobody
lives
in
it
only
when
the
examinations
are
going
on
you
may
see
a
few
hooded
figures
who
walk
as
though
conscious
of
the
powers
of
academic
life
and
death
which
they
wield
and
a
good
deal
of
shuddering
undergraduate
life
flitting
about
the
place
luckless
youths
in
white
ties
and
bands
who
are
undergoing
the
forte
et
with
different
degrees
of
composure
and
their
friends
who
are
there
to
look
after
them
you
may
go
in
and
watch
the
torture
yourself
if
you
are
so
minded
for
the
schools
are
open
to
the
public
but
one
such
experiment
will
be
enough
for
you
unless
you
are
very
the
sight
of
the
long
table
behind
which
sit
minos
rhadamanthus
stern
of
face
soft
of
speech
seizing
their
victim
in
turn
now
letting
him
run
a
little
way
as
a
cat
does
a
mouse
then
drawing
him
back
with
claw
of
wily
question
probing
him
on
this
side
and
that
turning
him
inside
out
the
row
of
victims
opposite
pale
or
flushed
of
anxious
or
careless
mien
according
to
temperament
but
one
and
all
on
the
rack
as
they
bend
over
the
allotted
paper
or
read
from
the
book
the
row
behind
of
future
victims
sitting
for
the
schools
as
it
is
called
ruthlessly
brought
hither
by
statutes
to
watch
the
sufferings
they
must
hereafter
undergo
should
fill
the
friend
of
suffering
humanity
with
thoughts
too
deep
for
tears
through
the
long
day
till
four
or
later
the
torture
lasts
then
the
last
victim
is
dismissed
the
men
who
are
sitting
for
the
schools
fly
all
ways
to
their
colleges
silently
in
search
of
relief
to
their
feelings
probably
also
of
beer

the

those
ruthless
doors

by
twos
and
threes
the
friends
of
the
victims
waiting
for
the
reopening
of
the
door

the
distribution

readers
will
be
pleased
to
understand

under
the
hands
of
the
examiners
that
your

has
seldom
seen
a
sight
over
which
she
would
more
willingly
draw
the
veil
with
averted
face
than
that
of
the
youth
rushing
wildly
dissolved
in
tears
from
the

and
shouting

papa
plucked
papa
plucked
the
examination
is
nearly
over
which
is
to
decide
the
academical
fate
of
some
of
our
characters
the
of
the
candidates
for
honors
has
been
going
on
for
the
last
week
every
morning
our
three
ambrose
acquaintances
have
mustered
with
the
rest
for
the
anxious
day
work
after
such
breakfasts
as
they
have
been
able
to
eat
under
the
circumstances
they
take
their
work
in
very
different
ways
grey
rushes
nervously
back
to
his
rooms
whenever
he
is
out
of
the
schools
for
ten
minutes
to
look
up
dates
and
dodges
he
worries
himself
sadly
over
every
blunder
which
he
discovers
himself
to
have
made
and
sits
up
nearly
all
night
cramming
always
hoping
for
a
better
blake
keeps
up
his
affected
carelessness
to
the
last
quizzing
the
examiners
laughing
over
the
shots
he
has
been
making
in
the
last
paper
his
shots
it
must
be
said
turn
out
well
for
the
most
part
in
the
taste
paper
particularly
as
they
compare
notes
he
seems
to
have
almost
struck
the
in
his
answers
to
one
or
two
questions
which
hardy
and
grey
have
passed
over
altogether
when
he
is
wide
of
the
mark
he
passes
it
off
with
some
jesting
remark
that
a
fool
can
ask
in
five
minutes
more
questions
than
a
wise
man
can
answer
in
a
week
or
wish
that
the
examiners
would
play
fair
and
change
sides
of
the
table
for
an
hour
with
the
candidates
for
a
finish
but
he
too
though
he
does
it
on
the
sly
is
cramming
with
his
coach
at
every
available
spare
moment
hardy
had
finished
his
reading
a
full
hours
before
the
first
day
of
and
had
braced
himself
for
the
actual
struggle
by
two
good
nights
rest
and
a
long
day
on
the
river
with
tom
he
had
worked
hard
from
the
first
and
so
had
really
mastered
his
books
and
now
feeling
that
he
had
fairly
and
honestly
done
his
best
and
that
if
he
fails
it
will
be
either
from
bad
luck
or
natural
incapacity
and
not
from
his
own
fault
he
manages
to
keep
a
cooler
head
than
any
of
his
companions
in
trouble
the
week
passed
off
uneventfully
then
comes
the
work
for
the
candidates
for
honors
they
go
in
in
alphabetical
order
four
a
day
for
one
more
day
work
the
hardest
of
all
and
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
do
but
wait
patiently
for
the
class
list
on
these
days
there
is
a
good
attendance
in
the
enclosed
space
to
which
the
public
are
admitted
the
front
seats
are
often
occupied
by
the
private
tutors
of
the
candidates
who
are
there
like
newmarket
trainers
to
see
the
performance
of
their
stables
marking
how
each
colt
bears
pressing
and
comports
himself
when
the
pinch
comes
they
watch
the
examiners
too
carefully
to
see
what
line
they
take
whether
science
or
history
or
scholarship
is
likely
to
tell
most
that
they
may
handle
the
rest
of
their
starts
accordingly
behind
them
for
the
most
part
on
the
hindermost
benches
of
the
flight
of
raised
steps
anxious
younger
brothers
and
friends
sit
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
flitting
in
and
out
in
much
unrest
and
making
the
objects
of
their
solicitude
more
nervous
than
ever
by
their
sympathy
it
is
now
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
of
the
examinations
in
honors
blake
is
one
of
the
men
in
his
tutor
hardy
grey
tom
and
other
ambrose
men
have
all
been
in
the
schools
more
or
less
during
his
examination
and
now
hardy
and
tom
are
waiting
outside
the
doors
for
the
issuing
of
the
testamurs
the
group
is
small
enough
it
is
so
much
of
course
that
a
should
get
his
testamur
that
there
is
no
excitement
about
it
generally
the
man
himself
stops
to
receive
it
the
only
anxious
faces
in
the
group
are
tom
and
hardy
they
have
not
exchanged
a
word
for
the
last
few
minutes
in
their
short
walk
before
the
door
now
the
examiners
come
out
and
walk
away
towards
their
colleges
and
the
next
minute
the
door
again
opens
and
the
clerk
of
the
schools
appears
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
now
you
see
if
i
am
not
right
said
hardy
as
they
gathered
to
the
door
with
the
rest
i
tell
you
there
is
the
least
chance
for
him
the
clerk
read
out
the
names
inscribed
on
the
testamurs
which
he
held
and
handed
them
to
the
owners
have
you
one
for
blake
of
st
ambrose
said
tom
desperately
as
the
clerk
was
closing
the
door
no
sir
none
but
those
i
have
just
given
out
answered
the
clerk
shaking
his
head
the
door
closed
and
they
turned
away
in
silence
for
the
first
minute
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
said
hardy
as
they
passed
out
of
the
south
gate
into
the
ratcliff
quadrangle
but
he
seemed
to
be
doing
so
well
when
i
was
in
you
were
not
there
at
the
time
i
thought
at
first
they
would
have
sent
him
out
of
the
schools
at
once
in
his
divinity
was
it
yes
he
was
asked
to
repeat
one
of
the
articles
and
did
know
three
words
of
it
from
that
moment
i
saw
it
was
all
over
the
examiner
and
he
both
lost
their
tempers
and
it
went
from
bad
to
worse
till
the
examiner
remarked
that
he
could
have
answered
one
of
the
questions
he
was
asking
when
he
was
ten
years
old
and
blake
replied
so
could
he
they
gave
him
a
paper
in
divinity
afterwards
but
you
could
see
there
was
no
chance
for
him
poor
fellow
what
will
he
do
do
you
think
how
will
he
take
it
i
can
tell
but
i
afraid
it
will
be
a
very
serious
matter
for
him
he
was
the
ablest
man
in
our
year
too
what
a
pity
they
got
into
ambrose
just
as
the
bell
for
afternoon
chapel
was
going
down
and
went
in
blake
was
there
and
one
look
showed
him
what
had
happened
in
fact
he
had
expected
nothing
else
all
day
since
his
breakdown
in
the
articles
tom
could
help
watching
him
during
chapel
and
afterwards
on
that
evening
acknowledged
to
a
friend
that
whatever
else
you
might
think
of
blake
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
gameness
after
chapel
he
loitered
outside
the
door
in
the
quadrangle
talking
just
as
usual
and
before
hall
he
loitered
on
the
steps
in
carelessness
everybody
else
was
thinking
of
his
breakdown
some
with
real
sorrow
and
sympathy
others
as
of
any
other
nine
days
wonder
pretty
much
as
if
the
favourite
for
the
derby
had
broken
down
others
with
triumph
for
blake
had
many
enemies
amongst
the
men
he
himself
was
conscious
enough
of
what
they
were
thinking
but
maintained
his
easy
gay
manner
through
it
all
though
the
effort
it
cost
him
was
tremendous
the
only
allusion
he
made
to
what
had
happened
which
tom
heard
was
when
he
asked
him
to
wine
are
you
engaged
brown
he
said
tom
answered
in
the
negative
come
to
me
then
he
went
on
you
wo
get
another
chance
in
ambrose
i
have
a
few
bottles
of
old
wine
left
we
may
as
well
floor
them
they
wo
bear
moving
to
a
hall
with
their
master
and
then
he
turned
to
some
other
men
and
asked
them
everyone
in
fact
who
he
came
across
especially
the
dominant
fast
set
with
whom
he
had
chiefly
lived
these
young
gentlemen
of
whom
we
had
a
glimpse
at
the
outset
but
whose
company
we
have
carefully
avoided
ever
since
seeing
that
their
sayings
and
doings
were
of
a
kind
of
which
the
less
said
the
better
had
been
steadily
going
on
in
their
way
getting
more
and
more
idle
reckless
and
insolent
their
doings
had
been
already
so
scandalous
on
several
occasions
as
to
call
for
solemn
meetings
of
the
college
authorities
but
no
vigorous
measures
having
followed
such
deliberations
had
only
made
matters
worse
and
given
the
men
a
notion
that
they
could
do
what
they
pleased
with
impunity
this
night
the
climax
had
come
it
was
as
though
the
flood
of
misrule
had
at
last
broken
banks
and
overflowed
the
whole
college
for
two
hours
the
wine
party
in
blake
large
rooms
was
kept
up
with
a
wild
reckless
mirth
in
keeping
with
the
host
temper
blake
was
on
his
mettle
he
had
asked
every
man
with
whom
he
had
a
speaking
acquaintance
as
if
he
wished
to
face
out
his
disaster
at
once
to
the
whole
world
many
of
the
men
came
feeling
uncomfortable
and
would
sooner
have
stayed
away
and
treated
the
pluck
as
real
misfortune
but
after
all
blake
was
the
best
judge
of
how
he
liked
to
be
treated
and
if
he
had
a
fancy
for
giving
a
great
wine
on
the
occasion
the
civilest
thing
to
do
was
to
get
to
it
and
so
they
went
and
wondered
as
much
as
he
could
desire
at
the
brilliant
coolness
of
their
host
speculating
and
doubting
nevertheless
in
their
own
secret
hearts
whether
it
was
acting
after
all
acting
it
was
no
doubt
and
not
worth
the
doing
no
acting
is
but
one
must
make
allowances
no
two
men
take
a
thing
just
alike
and
very
few
can
sit
down
quietly
when
they
have
lost
a
fall
in
life
wrestle
and
say
well
here
i
am
beaten
no
doubt
this
time
but
my
own
fault
too
now
take
a
good
look
at
me
my
good
friends
as
i
know
you
all
want
to
do
and
say
your
say
out
for
i
mean
getting
up
again
directly
and
having
another
turn
at
it
blake
drank
freely
himself
and
urged
his
guests
to
drink
which
was
a
superfluous
courtesy
for
the
most
part
many
of
the
men
left
his
room
considerably
excited
they
had
dispersed
for
an
hour
or
so
to
billiards
or
a
stroll
in
the
town
and
at
ten
reassembled
at
supper
parties
of
which
there
were
several
in
college
this
evening
especially
a
monster
one
at
chanter
rooms
a
champagne
supper
as
he
had
carefully
and
ostentatiously
announced
on
the
cards
of
invitation
this
flaunting
the
champagne
in
their
faces
had
been
resented
by
drysdale
and
others
who
drank
his
champagne
in
tumblers
and
then
abused
it
and
clamored
for
beer
in
the
middle
of
the
supper
chanter
whose
prodigality
in
some
ways
was
only
exceeded
by
his
general
meanness
had
lost
his
temper
at
this
demand
and
insisted
that
if
they
wanted
beer
they
might
send
for
it
themselves
for
he
would
pay
for
it
this
protest
was
treated
with
uproarious
contempt
and
gallons
of
ale
soon
made
their
appearance
in
college
jugs
and
tankards
the
tables
were
cleared
and
songs
most
of
them
of
more
than
doubtful
character
cigars
and
all
sorts
of
compounded
drinks
from
claret
cup
to
egg
flip
succeeded
the
company
recruited
constantly
as
men
came
into
the
college
was
getting
more
and
more
excited
every
minute
the
scouts
cleared
away
and
carried
off
the
relics
of
the
supper
and
then
left
still
the
revel
went
on
till
by
midnight
the
men
were
ripe
for
any
mischief
or
folly
which
those
among
them
who
retained
any
brains
at
all
could
suggest
the
signal
for
breaking
up
was
given
by
the
host
falling
from
his
seat
some
of
the
men
rose
with
a
shout
to
put
him
to
bed
which
they
accomplished
with
difficulty
after
dropping
him
several
times
and
left
him
to
snore
off
the
effects
of
his
debauch
with
one
of
his
boots
on
others
took
to
doing
what
mischief
occurred
to
them
in
his
rooms
one
man
mounted
on
a
chair
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
which
had
gone
out
was
employed
in
pouring
the
contents
of
a
champagne
bottle
with
unsteady
hand
into
the
clock
on
the
chanter
was
a
particular
man
in
this
sort
of
furniture
and
his
clock
was
rather
a
specialty
it
was
a
large
bronze
figure
of
atlas
supporting
the
globe
in
the
shape
of
a
unluckily
the
maker
not
anticipating
the
sort
of
test
to
which
his
work
would
be
subjected
had
ingeniously
left
the
hole
for
winding
up
in
the
top
of
the
clock
so
that
unusual
facilities
existed
for
drowning
the
and
he
was
already
almost
at
his
last
tick
one
or
two
men
were
morally
aiding
and
abetting
and
physically
supporting
the
experimenter
on
clocks
who
found
it
difficult
to
stand
to
his
work
by
himself
another
knot
of
young
gentlemen
stuck
to
the
tables
and
so
continued
to
shout
out
scraps
of
song
sometimes
standing
on
their
chairs
and
sometimes
tumbling
off
them
another
set
were
employed
on
the
amiable
work
of
pouring
beer
and
sugar
into
three
new
pairs
of
polished
leather
dress
boots
with
colored
tops
to
them
which
they
discovered
in
the
certainly
as
they
remarked
chanter
could
have
no
possible
use
for
so
many
dress
boots
at
once
and
it
was
a
pity
the
beer
should
be
wasted
but
on
the
whole
perhaps
the
materials
were
never
meant
for
combination
and
had
better
have
been
kept
apart
others
had
gone
away
to
break
into
the
kitchen
headed
by
one
who
had
just
come
into
college
and
vowed
he
would
have
some
supper
and
others
to
screw
up
an
unpopular
tutor
or
to
break
into
the
rooms
of
some
inoffensive
freshman
the
remainder
mustered
on
the
grass
in
the
quadrangle
and
began
playing
and
larking
one
another
amongst
these
last
was
our
hero
who
had
been
at
blake
wine
and
one
of
the
quieter
supper
parties
and
though
not
so
far
gone
as
most
of
his
companions
was
by
no
means
in
a
state
in
which
he
would
have
cared
to
meet
the
dean
he
lent
his
hearty
aid
accordingly
to
swell
the
noise
and
tumult
which
was
becoming
something
out
of
the
way
even
for
ambrose
as
the
was
flagging
drysdale
suddenly
appeared
carrying
some
silver
plates
which
were
used
on
solemn
occasions
in
the
common
room
and
allowed
to
be
issued
on
special
application
for
parties
a
rush
was
made
towards
him
halloa
here
drysdale
with
lots
of
swag
shouted
one
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
cried
another
drysdale
paused
a
moment
with
the
peculiarly
sapient
look
of
a
tipsy
man
who
has
suddenly
lost
the
thread
of
his
ideas
and
then
suddenly
broke
out
with
hang
it
i
forgot
but
let
play
at
quoits
with
them
the
proposal
was
received
with
applause
and
the
game
began
but
drysdale
soon
left
it
he
had
evidently
some
notion
in
his
head
which
would
not
suffer
him
to
turn
to
anything
else
till
he
had
carried
it
out
he
went
off
accordingly
to
chanter
rooms
while
the
quoits
went
on
in
the
front
quadrangle
about
this
time
however
the
dean
and
bursar
and
the
tutors
who
lived
in
college
began
to
be
conscious
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
they
were
quite
used
to
distant
choruses
and
great
noises
in
the
men
rooms
and
to
a
fair
amount
of
shouting
and
skylarking
in
the
quadrangle
and
were
men
not
given
to
interfering
but
there
must
be
an
end
to
all
endurance
and
the
state
of
things
which
had
arrived
could
no
longer
be
met
by
a
turn
in
bed
and
a
growl
at
the
uproars
and
follies
of
undergraduates
presently
some
of
the
rioters
on
the
grass
caught
sight
of
a
figure
gliding
along
the
side
quadrangle
towards
the
staircase
a
shout
arose
that
the
enemy
was
up
but
little
heed
was
paid
to
it
by
the
greater
number
then
another
figure
passed
from
the
dean
staircase
to
the
porter
lodge
those
of
the
men
who
had
any
sense
left
saw
that
it
was
time
to
quit
and
after
warning
the
rest
went
off
towards
their
rooms
tom
on
his
way
to
his
staircase
caught
sight
of
a
figure
seated
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
inner
quadrangle
and
made
for
it
impelled
by
natural
curiosity
he
found
drysdale
seated
on
the
ground
with
several
silver
tankards
by
his
side
employed
to
the
best
of
his
powers
in
digging
a
hole
with
one
of
the
college
halloa
drysdale
what
are
you
up
to
he
shouted
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
providing
for
posterity
replied
drysdale
gravely
without
looking
up
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
do
be
such
an
ass
the
dean
will
be
out
in
a
minute
get
up
and
come
along
i
tell
you
old
fellow
said
drysdale
somewhat
inarticulately
and
driving
his
knife
into
the
ground
again
the
dons
are
going
to
spout
the
college
plate
so
i
am
burying
these
articles
for
poshterity
hang
posterity
said
tom
come
along
directly
or
you
be
caught
and
rusticated
go
to
bed
brown
you
drunk
brown
replied
drysdale
continuing
his
work
and
striking
the
into
the
ground
so
close
to
his
own
thigh
that
it
made
tom
shudder
here
they
are
then
he
cried
the
next
moment
seizing
drysdale
by
the
arm
as
a
rush
of
men
came
through
the
passage
into
the
quadrangle
shouting
and
tumbling
along
and
making
in
small
groups
for
the
different
the
dean
and
two
of
the
tutors
followed
and
the
porter
bearing
a
lantern
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
so
tom
after
one
more
struggle
to
pull
drysdale
up
and
hurry
him
off
gave
it
up
and
leaving
him
to
his
fate
ran
across
to
his
own
staircase
for
the
next
the
dean
and
his
party
patrolled
the
college
and
succeeded
at
the
last
in
restoring
order
though
not
without
some
undignified
and
disagreeable
passages
the
lights
on
the
staircases
which
generally
burnt
all
night
were
of
course
put
out
as
they
approached
on
the
first
staircase
which
they
stormed
the
porter
lantern
was
knocked
out
of
his
hand
by
an
unseen
adversary
and
the
light
put
out
on
the
bottom
stairs
on
the
first
landing
the
bursar
trod
on
a
small
terrier
belonging
to
a
fast
freshman
and
the
dog
naturally
thereupon
bit
the
leg
while
his
master
and
other
taking
advantage
of
the
diversion
rushed
down
the
dark
stairs
past
the
party
of
order
and
into
the
quadrangle
where
they
scattered
amidst
a
shout
of
laughter
while
the
porter
was
gone
for
a
light
the
dean
and
his
party
rashly
ventured
on
a
second
ascent
here
an
unexpected
catastrophy
awaited
them
on
the
top
landing
lived
one
of
the
steadiest
men
in
college
whose
door
had
been
tried
shortly
before
he
had
been
roused
out
of
his
first
sleep
and
vowing
vengeance
on
the
next
comers
stood
behind
his
oak
holding
his
brown
george
or
huge
earthenware
receptacle
half
full
of
dirty
water
in
which
his
had
been
washing
up
his
hearing
stealthy
steps
and
whisperings
on
the
stairs
below
he
suddenly
threw
open
his
oak
discharging
the
whole
contents
of
his
brown
george
on
the
approaching
authorities
with
a
shout
of
take
that
for
your
skulking
the
exasperated
dean
and
tutors
rushing
on
seized
their
astonished
and
innocent
assailant
and
after
receiving
explanations
and
the
offer
of
clean
towels
hurried
off
again
after
the
real
enemy
and
now
the
porter
appeared
again
with
a
light
and
continuing
their
rounds
they
apprehended
and
disarmed
drysdale
collected
the
college
plate
marked
down
others
of
the
rioters
visited
chanter
rooms
held
a
parley
with
the
one
of
their
number
who
was
screwed
up
in
his
rooms
and
discovered
that
the
bars
had
been
wrenched
out
of
the
kitchen
window
after
which
they
retired
to
sleep
on
their
indignation
and
quiet
settled
down
again
on
the
ancient
and
venerable
college
the
next
morning
at
chapel
many
of
the
revellers
met
in
fact
there
was
a
fuller
attendance
than
usual
for
every
one
felt
that
something
serious
must
be
impending
after
such
a
night
the
dons
must
make
a
stand
or
give
up
altogether
the
most
reckless
only
of
the
fast
set
were
absent
st
cloud
was
there
dressed
even
more
precisely
than
usual
and
looking
as
if
he
were
in
the
habit
of
going
to
bed
at
ten
and
had
never
heard
of
milk
punch
tom
turned
out
not
much
the
worse
himself
but
in
his
heart
feeling
not
a
little
ashamed
of
the
whole
business
of
the
party
the
men
but
above
all
of
himself
he
thrust
the
shame
back
however
as
well
as
he
could
and
put
a
cool
face
on
it
probably
most
of
the
men
were
in
much
the
same
state
of
mind
even
in
ambrose
reckless
and
vicious
as
the
college
had
become
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
undergraduates
would
gladly
have
seen
a
change
in
the
direction
of
order
and
decency
and
were
sick
of
the
wretched
license
of
doing
right
in
their
own
eyes
and
wrong
in
every
other
person
as
the
men
trooped
out
of
chapel
they
formed
in
corners
of
the
quadrangle
except
the
reading
set
who
went
off
quietly
to
their
rooms
there
was
a
pause
of
a
minute
or
two
neither
principal
dean
tutor
nor
fellow
followed
as
on
ordinary
occasions
they
hatching
something
in
the
outer
chapel
said
one
it
be
a
coarse
time
for
chanter
i
take
it
said
another
was
your
name
sent
to
the
buttery
for
his
supper
no
i
took
good
care
of
that
said
st
cloud
who
was
addressed
drysdale
was
caught
was
he
so
i
hear
and
nearly
frightened
the
dean
and
the
porter
out
of
their
wits
by
staggering
after
them
with
a
he
be
sacked
of
course
much
he
care
for
that
here
they
come
then
by
jove
how
black
they
look
the
authorities
now
came
out
of
the
antechapel
door
and
walked
slowly
across
towards
the
principal
house
in
a
body
at
this
moment
as
would
have
it
jack
trotted
into
the
front
quadrangle
dragging
after
him
the
light
steel
chain
with
which
he
was
usually
fastened
up
in
drysdale
scout
room
at
night
he
came
innocently
towards
one
and
another
of
the
groups
and
retired
from
each
much
astonished
at
the
low
growl
with
which
his
acquaintance
was
repudiated
on
all
sides
porter
whose
dog
is
that
said
the
dean
catching
sight
of
him
drysdale
dog
sir
i
think
sir
answered
the
porter
probably
the
animal
who
bit
me
last
night
said
the
bursar
his
knowledge
of
dogs
was
small
if
jack
had
fastened
on
him
he
would
probably
have
been
in
bed
from
the
effects
turn
the
dog
out
of
college
said
the
dean
please
sir
he
a
very
savage
dog
sir
said
the
porter
whose
respect
for
jack
was
unbounded
turn
him
out
immediately
replied
the
dean
the
wretched
porter
arming
himself
with
a
broom
approached
jack
and
after
some
coaxing
managed
to
catch
hold
of
the
end
of
his
chain
and
began
to
lead
him
towards
the
gates
carefully
holding
out
the
broom
towards
jack
nose
with
his
other
hand
to
protect
himself
jack
at
first
hauled
away
at
his
chain
and
then
began
circling
round
the
porter
at
the
full
extent
of
it
evidently
meditating
an
attack
notwithstanding
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
the
ludicrous
alarm
of
the
porter
set
the
men
laughing
come
along
or
jack
will
be
pinning
the
wretched
copas
said
jervis
and
he
and
tom
stepped
up
to
the
terrified
little
man
and
releasing
him
led
jack
who
knew
them
both
well
out
of
college
were
you
at
that
supper
party
said
jervis
as
they
deposited
jack
with
an
ostler
who
was
lounging
outside
the
gates
to
be
taken
to
drysdale
stables
no
said
tom
i
glad
to
hear
it
there
will
be
a
pretty
clean
sweep
after
last
night
doings
but
i
was
in
the
quadrangle
when
they
came
out
not
caught
eh
said
jervis
no
luckily
i
got
to
my
own
rooms
at
once
were
any
of
the
crew
caught
not
that
i
know
of
well
we
shall
hear
enough
of
it
before
lecture
time
jervis
was
right
there
was
a
meeting
in
the
common
room
directly
after
breakfast
drysdale
anticipating
his
fate
took
his
name
off
before
they
sent
for
him
chanter
and
three
or
four
others
were
rusticated
for
a
year
and
blake
was
ordered
to
go
down
at
once
he
was
a
scholar
and
what
was
to
be
done
in
his
case
would
be
settled
at
the
meeting
at
the
end
of
the
term
for
hours
it
was
supposed
that
st
cloud
had
escaped
altogether
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
summoned
before
a
meeting
in
the
common
room
the
tutor
whose
door
had
been
so
effectually
screwed
up
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
get
out
of
his
window
by
a
ladder
to
attend
morning
chapel
proved
wholly
unable
to
appreciate
the
joke
and
set
himself
to
work
to
discover
the
perpetrators
of
it
the
door
was
fastened
with
long
gimlets
which
had
been
screwed
firmly
in
and
when
driven
well
home
their
heads
knocked
off
the
tutor
collected
the
shafts
of
the
gimlets
from
the
carpenter
who
came
to
effect
an
entry
for
him
and
after
careful
examination
discovered
the
trade
mark
so
putting
them
into
his
pocket
he
walked
off
into
the
town
and
soon
came
back
with
the
information
he
required
which
resulted
in
the
rustication
of
st
cloud
an
event
which
was
borne
by
the
college
with
the
greatest
equanimity
shortly
afterwards
tom
attended
in
the
schools
quadrangle
again
to
be
present
at
the
posting
of
the
class
list
this
time
there
were
plenty
of
anxious
faces
the
quadrangle
was
full
of
them
he
felt
almost
as
nervous
himself
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
the
third
gun
he
thrust
himself
forward
and
was
amongst
the
first
who
caught
sight
of
the
document
one
look
was
enough
for
him
and
the
next
moment
he
was
off
at
full
speed
for
ambrose
and
rushing
headlong
into
hardy
rooms
seized
him
by
the
hand
and
shook
it
vehemently
it
all
right
old
fellow
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
could
catch
his
breath
it
all
right
four
firsts
you
one
of
them
well
done
and
grey
where
he
is
he
all
right
bless
me
i
forgot
to
look
said
tom
i
only
read
the
firsts
and
then
came
off
as
hard
as
i
could
then
he
is
not
a
first
no
i
sure
of
that
i
must
go
and
see
him
he
deserved
it
far
more
than
i
no
by
jove
old
boy
said
tom
seizing
him
again
by
the
hand
that
he
did
nor
any
man
that
ever
went
into
the
schools
thank
you
brown
said
hardy
returning
his
warm
grip
you
do
one
good
now
to
see
poor
grey
and
to
write
to
my
dear
old
father
before
hall
fancy
him
opening
the
letter
at
breakfast
the
day
after
i
hope
it
wo
hurt
him
never
fear
i
do
believe
in
people
dying
of
joy
and
anything
short
of
sudden
death
he
wo
mind
at
the
price
hardy
hurried
off
and
tom
went
to
his
own
rooms
and
smoked
a
cigar
to
allay
his
excitement
and
thought
about
his
friend
and
all
they
had
felt
together
and
laughed
and
mourned
over
in
the
short
months
of
their
friendship
a
pleasant
dreamy
he
spent
thus
till
the
hall
bell
roused
him
and
he
made
his
toilette
and
went
to
his
dinner
it
was
with
very
mixed
feelings
that
hardy
walked
by
the
servitors
table
and
took
his
seat
with
the
bachelors
an
equal
at
last
amongst
equals
no
man
who
is
worth
his
salt
can
leave
a
place
where
he
has
gone
through
hard
and
searching
discipline
and
been
tried
in
the
very
depths
of
his
heart
without
regret
however
much
he
may
have
winced
under
the
discipline
it
is
no
light
thing
to
fold
up
and
lay
by
forever
a
portion
of
one
life
even
when
it
can
be
laid
by
with
honor
and
in
thankfulness
but
it
was
with
no
mixed
feelings
but
with
a
sense
of
entire
triumph
and
joy
that
tom
watched
his
friend
taking
his
new
place
and
the
dons
one
after
another
coming
up
and
congratulating
him
and
treating
him
as
the
man
who
had
done
honor
to
them
and
his
college
chapter
xxv
commemoration
the
end
of
the
academic
year
was
now
at
hand
and
oxford
was
beginning
to
put
on
her
gayest
clothing
the
college
gardeners
were
in
a
state
of
unusual
activity
and
the
lawns
and
which
form
such
exquisite
settings
to
many
of
the
venerable
grey
gabled
buildings
were
as
neat
and
as
bright
as
hands
could
make
them
cooks
butlers
and
their
assistants
were
bestirring
themselves
in
kitchen
and
buttery
under
the
direction
of
bursars
jealous
of
the
fame
of
their
houses
in
the
preparation
of
the
abundant
and
solid
fare
with
which
oxford
is
wont
to
entertain
all
comers
everything
the
best
of
its
kind
no
stint
but
no
nonsense
seems
to
be
the
wise
rule
which
the
university
hands
down
and
lives
up
to
in
these
matters
however
we
may
differ
as
to
her
degeneracy
in
other
departments
all
who
have
ever
visited
her
will
admit
that
in
this
of
hospitality
she
is
still
a
great
national
teacher
acknowledging
and
preaching
by
example
the
fact
that
eating
and
drinking
are
important
parts
of
man
life
which
are
to
be
allowed
their
due
prominence
and
not
thrust
into
a
corner
but
are
to
be
done
soberly
and
thankfully
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
the
coaches
were
bringing
in
heavy
loads
of
visitors
carriages
of
all
kinds
were
coming
in
from
the
neighbouring
counties
and
lodgings
in
the
were
going
up
to
fabulous
prices
in
one
of
these
lodgings
on
the
evening
of
the
saturday
before
commemoration
miss
winter
and
her
cousin
are
sitting
they
have
been
in
oxford
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
having
posted
up
from
englebourn
but
they
have
only
just
come
in
for
the
younger
lady
is
still
in
her
bonnet
and
miss
winter
lies
on
the
table
the
windows
are
wide
open
and
miss
winter
is
sitting
at
one
of
them
while
her
cousin
is
busied
in
examining
the
furniture
and
decorations
of
their
temporary
home
now
commenting
upon
these
now
pouring
out
praises
of
oxford
is
it
too
charming
i
never
dreamt
that
any
town
could
be
so
beautiful
do
you
feel
wild
about
it
katie
it
is
the
queen
of
towns
dear
but
i
know
it
well
you
see
so
that
i
ca
be
quite
so
enthusiastic
as
you
oh
those
dear
gardens
what
was
the
name
of
those
ones
with
the
targets
up
where
they
were
shooting
do
you
remember
new
college
gardens
on
the
old
city
wall
you
mean
no
no
they
were
nice
and
sentimental
i
should
like
to
go
and
sit
and
read
poetry
there
but
i
mean
the
big
ones
the
gorgeous
princely
ones
with
wicked
old
bishop
laud
gallery
looking
into
them
oh
john
of
course
yes
john
why
do
you
hate
laud
so
katie
i
do
hate
him
dear
he
was
a
berkshire
man
you
know
but
i
think
he
did
a
great
deal
of
harm
to
the
church
how
did
you
think
my
new
silk
looked
in
the
garden
how
lucky
i
brought
it
was
it
i
should
have
liked
to
have
been
in
nothing
but
muslin
they
do
suit
here
you
want
something
richer
amongst
the
old
buildings
and
on
the
beautiful
velvety
turf
of
the
gardens
how
do
you
think
i
looked
you
looked
like
a
queen
dear
or
a
at
least
yes
a
on
henrietta
maria
did
you
hear
one
of
the
gentlemen
say
that
she
was
lodged
in
john
when
charles
marched
to
relieve
gloucester
ah
ca
you
fancy
her
sweeping
about
the
gardens
with
her
ladies
following
her
and
bishop
laud
walking
just
a
little
behind
her
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
about
let
me
see
something
very
important
oh
mary
where
has
your
history
gone
he
was
archbishop
and
was
safely
locked
up
in
the
tower
well
perhaps
he
was
then
he
could
be
with
her
of
course
how
stupid
of
you
to
remember
katie
why
ca
you
make
up
your
mind
to
enjoy
yourself
when
you
come
out
for
a
holiday
i
should
enjoy
myself
any
the
more
for
forgetting
dates
said
katie
laughing
oh
you
would
though
only
try
but
let
me
see
it
ca
be
laud
then
it
shall
be
that
cruel
drinking
old
man
with
the
wooden
leg
made
of
gold
who
was
governor
of
oxford
when
the
king
was
away
he
must
be
hobbling
along
after
the
queen
in
a
buff
coat
and
breastplate
holding
his
hat
with
a
long
drooping
white
feather
in
his
hand
but
you
would
like
it
at
all
mary
it
would
be
too
serious
for
you
the
poor
queen
would
be
too
anxious
for
gossip
and
you
would
be
obliged
to
walk
after
her
without
saying
a
word
yes
that
would
be
stupid
but
then
she
would
have
to
go
away
with
the
old
governor
to
write
dispatches
and
some
of
the
young
officers
with
long
hair
and
beautiful
lace
sleeves
and
large
boots
whom
the
king
had
left
behind
wounded
might
come
and
walk
perhaps
or
sit
in
the
sun
in
the
quiet
gardens
mary
looked
over
her
shoulder
with
the
merriest
twinkle
in
her
eye
to
see
how
her
steady
cousin
would
take
this
last
picture
the
college
authorities
would
never
allow
that
she
said
quietly
still
looking
out
the
window
if
you
wanted
beaus
you
must
have
had
them
in
black
gowns
they
would
have
been
jealous
of
the
soldiers
you
think
well
i
do
mind
the
black
gowns
are
very
pleasant
only
a
little
stiff
but
how
do
you
think
my
bonnet
looked
charmingly
but
when
are
you
going
to
have
done
looking
in
the
glass
you
do
care
for
the
buildings
i
believe
a
bit
come
and
look
at
mary
there
is
such
a
lovely
light
on
the
steeple
i
come
directly
but
i
must
get
these
flowers
right
i
sure
there
are
too
many
in
this
trimming
mary
was
trying
her
new
bonnet
on
over
and
over
again
before
the
and
pulling
out
and
changing
the
places
of
the
buds
with
which
it
was
trimmed
just
then
a
noise
of
wheels
accompanied
by
a
merry
tune
on
a
cornopean
came
in
from
the
street
what
that
katie
she
cried
stopping
her
work
for
a
moment
a
coach
coming
up
from
magdalen
bridge
i
think
it
is
a
cricketing
party
coming
home
oh
let
me
see
and
she
tripped
across
to
the
window
bonnet
in
hand
and
stood
beside
her
cousin
and
then
sure
enough
a
coach
covered
with
cricketers
returning
from
a
match
drove
past
the
window
the
young
ladies
looked
out
at
first
with
great
curiosity
but
suddenly
finding
themselves
the
mark
for
a
whole
coach
load
of
male
eyes
shrank
back
a
little
before
the
cricketers
had
passed
on
towards
the
mitre
as
the
coach
passed
out
of
sight
mary
gave
a
pretty
toss
of
her
head
and
said
well
they
do
want
for
assurance
at
any
rate
i
think
they
need
have
stared
so
it
was
our
fault
said
katie
we
should
have
been
at
the
window
besides
you
know
you
are
to
be
a
on
henrietta
maria
up
here
and
of
course
you
must
get
used
to
being
stared
at
oh
yes
but
that
was
to
be
by
young
gentlemen
wounded
in
the
wars
in
lace
ruffles
as
one
sees
them
in
pictures
that
a
very
different
thing
from
young
gentlemen
in
flannel
trousers
and
straw
hats
driving
up
the
high
street
on
coaches
i
declare
one
of
them
had
the
impudence
to
bow
as
if
he
knew
you
so
he
does
that
was
my
cousin
your
cousin
ah
i
remember
then
he
must
be
my
cousin
too
no
not
at
all
he
is
no
relation
of
yours
well
i
break
my
heart
but
is
he
a
good
partner
i
should
say
yes
but
i
hardly
know
we
used
to
be
a
great
deal
together
as
children
but
papa
has
been
such
an
invalid
lately
ah
i
wonder
how
uncle
is
getting
on
at
the
look
it
is
past
eight
by
mary
when
were
we
to
go
we
were
asked
for
nine
then
we
must
go
and
dress
will
it
be
very
slow
and
stiff
katie
i
wish
we
were
going
to
something
not
quite
so
grand
you
find
it
very
pleasant
i
dare
say
there
wo
be
any
dancing
though
i
know
will
there
no
i
should
think
certainly
not
dear
me
i
hope
there
will
be
some
young
men
there
i
shall
be
so
shy
i
know
if
there
are
nothing
but
wise
people
how
do
you
talk
to
a
regius
professor
katie
it
must
be
awful
he
will
probably
be
at
least
as
uncomfortable
as
you
dear
said
miss
winter
laughing
and
rising
from
the
window
let
us
go
and
dress
shall
i
wear
my
best
gown
what
shall
i
put
in
my
hair
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
introduced
brown
it
was
the
ambrose
drag
which
had
passed
along
shortly
before
bearing
the
eleven
home
from
a
triumphant
match
as
they
came
over
magdalen
bridge
drysdale
who
had
returned
to
oxford
as
a
private
gentleman
after
his
late
catastrophe
which
he
had
managed
to
keep
a
secret
from
his
guardian
and
was
occupying
his
usual
place
on
the
box
called
out
now
boys
keep
your
eyes
open
there
must
be
plenty
of
lionesses
about
and
thus
warned
the
whole
load
including
the
cornopean
player
were
on
the
for
lady
visitors
profanely
called
lionesses
all
the
way
up
the
street
they
had
been
gratified
by
the
sight
of
several
walking
in
the
high
street
or
looking
out
of
the
windows
before
they
caught
sight
of
miss
winter
and
her
cousin
the
appearance
of
these
young
ladies
created
a
sensation
i
say
look
up
there
in
that
first
floor
by
george
they
something
like
the
sitter
for
choice
no
no
the
one
she
looks
so
saucy
hello
brown
do
you
know
them
one
of
them
is
my
cousin
said
tom
who
had
just
been
guilty
of
the
salutation
which
as
we
saw
excited
the
indignation
of
the
younger
lady
what
luck
you
ask
me
to
meet
them
when
shall
it
be
at
breakfast
i
vote
i
say
you
introduce
me
before
the
ball
on
monday
promise
now
said
another
i
do
know
that
i
shall
see
anything
of
them
said
tom
i
shall
just
leave
a
pasteboard
but
i
not
in
the
humour
to
be
dancing
about
lionizing
a
storm
of
indignation
arose
at
this
speech
the
notion
that
any
of
the
fraternity
who
had
any
hold
on
lionesses
particularly
if
they
were
pretty
should
not
use
it
to
the
utmost
for
the
benefit
of
the
rest
and
the
glory
and
honor
of
the
college
was
revolting
to
the
under
graduate
mind
so
the
whole
body
escorted
tom
to
the
door
of
the
lodgings
impressing
upon
him
the
necessity
of
engaging
both
his
lionesses
for
every
hour
of
every
day
in
ambrose
and
left
him
not
till
they
had
heard
him
ask
for
the
young
ladies
and
seen
him
fairly
on
his
way
upstairs
they
need
not
have
taken
so
much
trouble
for
in
his
secret
soul
he
was
no
little
pleased
at
the
appearance
of
creditable
ladies
more
or
less
belonging
to
him
and
would
have
found
his
way
to
see
them
quickly
and
surely
enough
without
any
urging
moreover
he
had
been
really
fond
of
his
cousin
years
before
when
they
had
been
boy
and
girl
together
so
they
greeted
one
another
very
cordially
and
looked
one
another
over
as
they
shook
hands
to
see
what
changes
time
had
made
he
makes
his
changes
rapidly
enough
at
that
age
and
mostly
for
the
better
as
the
two
cousins
thought
it
was
nearly
three
years
since
they
had
met
and
then
he
was
a
boy
and
she
a
girl
in
the
they
were
both
conscious
of
a
strange
pleasure
in
meeting
again
mixed
with
a
feeling
of
shyness
and
wonder
whether
they
should
be
able
to
step
back
into
their
old
relations
mary
looked
on
demurely
really
watching
them
but
ostensibly
engaged
on
the
rosebud
trimming
presently
miss
winter
turned
to
her
and
said
i
do
think
you
two
ever
met
before
i
must
introduce
you
i
suppose
my
cousin
tom
my
cousin
mary
then
we
must
be
cousins
too
said
tom
holding
out
his
hand
no
katie
says
not
she
answered
i
do
mean
to
believe
her
then
said
tom
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
why
did
you
write
and
tell
me
you
were
coming
we
have
been
so
shut
up
lately
owing
to
papa
bad
health
that
i
really
had
almost
forgotten
that
you
were
at
oxford
by
the
bye
said
tom
where
is
uncle
oh
he
is
dining
at
the
who
is
an
old
college
friend
of
his
we
have
only
been
up
here
three
or
four
hours
and
it
has
done
him
so
much
good
i
am
so
glad
we
spirited
him
up
to
coming
you
have
made
any
engagements
yet
i
hope
indeed
we
have
i
ca
tell
how
many
we
came
in
time
for
luncheon
in
balliol
mary
and
i
made
it
our
dinner
and
we
have
been
seeing
sights
ever
since
and
have
been
asked
to
go
to
i
do
know
how
many
luncheons
and
breakfasts
what
with
a
lot
of
dons
i
suppose
said
tom
spitefully
you
wo
enjoy
oxford
then
they
bore
you
to
death
there
now
katie
that
is
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
joined
in
mary
you
remember
we
did
hear
a
word
about
balls
all
the
afternoon
you
have
got
your
tickets
for
the
balls
then
said
tom
brightening
up
no
how
shall
we
get
them
oh
i
can
manage
that
i
no
doubt
stop
how
are
we
to
go
papa
will
never
take
us
you
need
think
about
that
anybody
will
chaperone
you
nobody
cares
about
that
sort
of
thing
at
commemoration
indeed
i
think
you
had
better
wait
till
i
have
talked
to
papa
then
all
the
tickets
will
be
gone
said
tom
you
must
go
why
should
i
chaperone
you
i
know
several
men
whose
sisters
are
going
with
them
no
that
will
scarcely
do
i
afraid
but
really
mary
we
must
go
and
dress
where
are
you
going
then
said
tom
to
an
evening
party
at
the
we
are
asked
for
nine
and
the
half
hour
has
struck
hang
the
dons
how
unlucky
that
i
did
know
before
have
you
any
flowers
by
the
way
not
one
then
i
will
try
to
get
you
some
by
the
time
you
are
ready
may
i
oh
yes
pray
do
said
mary
that
capital
katie
is
it
now
i
shall
have
some
thing
to
put
in
my
hair
i
could
think
what
i
was
to
wear
tom
took
a
look
at
the
hair
in
question
and
then
left
them
and
hastened
out
to
scour
the
town
for
flowers
as
if
his
life
depended
on
success
in
the
morning
he
would
probably
have
resented
as
insulting
or
laughed
at
as
wildly
improbable
the
suggestion
that
he
would
be
so
employed
before
night
a
double
chair
was
drawn
up
opposite
the
door
when
he
came
back
and
the
ladies
were
coming
down
into
the
oh
look
katie
what
lovely
flowers
how
very
kind
of
you
tom
surrendered
as
much
of
his
burden
as
that
young
lady
little
round
white
hands
could
clasp
to
her
and
deposited
the
rest
on
the
table
now
katie
which
shall
i
wear
this
beautiful
white
rose
all
by
itself
or
a
wreath
of
these
pansies
here
i
have
a
wire
i
can
make
them
up
in
a
minute
she
turned
to
the
glass
and
held
the
rich
rose
against
her
hair
and
then
turning
on
tom
added
what
do
you
think
i
thought
fern
would
suit
your
hair
better
than
anything
else
said
tom
and
so
i
got
these
leaves
and
he
picked
out
two
slender
how
very
kind
of
you
let
me
see
how
do
you
mean
ah
i
see
it
will
be
charming
and
so
saying
she
held
the
leaves
one
in
each
hand
to
the
sides
of
her
head
and
then
floated
about
the
room
for
needle
and
thread
and
with
a
few
nimble
stitches
fastened
together
the
simple
green
crown
which
her
cousin
put
on
for
her
making
the
points
meet
above
her
forehead
mary
was
wild
with
delight
at
the
effect
and
full
of
thanks
to
tom
as
he
helped
them
hastily
to
tie
up
bouquets
and
then
amidst
much
laughing
they
squeezed
into
the
wheel
chair
together
as
the
fashions
of
that
day
allowed
two
young
ladies
to
do
and
went
off
to
their
party
leaving
a
last
injuction
on
him
to
go
up
and
put
the
rest
of
the
flowers
in
water
and
to
call
directly
after
breakfast
the
next
day
he
obeyed
his
orders
and
pensively
arranged
the
rest
of
the
flowers
in
the
china
ornaments
on
the
and
in
a
soup
plate
which
he
got
and
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
then
spent
some
minutes
examining
a
pair
of
gloves
and
other
small
articles
of
women
gear
which
lay
scattered
about
the
room
the
gloves
particularly
attracted
him
and
he
flattened
them
out
and
laid
them
on
his
own
large
brown
hand
and
smiled
at
the
contrast
and
took
further
unjustifiable
liberties
with
them
after
which
he
returned
to
college
and
endured
much
banter
as
to
the
time
his
call
had
lasted
and
promised
to
engage
his
cousins
as
he
called
them
to
grace
some
festivities
in
ambrose
at
their
first
spare
moment
the
next
day
being
show
sunday
was
spent
by
the
young
ladies
in
a
ferment
of
spiritual
and
other
dissipation
they
attended
morning
service
at
eight
at
the
cathedral
breakfasted
at
a
merton
fellow
from
whence
they
adjourned
to
university
sermon
here
mary
after
two
or
three
utterly
ineffectual
attempts
to
understand
what
the
preacher
was
meaning
soon
relapsed
into
an
examination
of
the
bonnets
present
and
the
doctors
and
proctors
on
the
floor
and
the
undergraduates
in
the
gallery
on
the
whole
she
was
perhaps
better
employed
than
her
cousin
who
knew
enough
of
religious
party
strife
to
follow
the
preacher
and
was
made
very
uncomfortable
by
his
discourse
which
consisted
of
an
attack
upon
the
recent
publications
of
the
most
eminent
and
best
men
in
the
university
poor
miss
winter
came
away
with
a
vague
impression
of
the
wickedness
of
all
persons
who
dare
to
travel
out
of
beaten
tracks
and
that
the
most
unsafe
state
of
mind
in
the
world
is
that
which
inquires
and
aspires
and
can
not
be
satisfied
with
the
regulation
draught
of
spiritual
doctors
in
high
places
being
naturally
of
a
reverent
turn
of
mind
she
tried
to
think
that
the
discourse
had
done
her
good
at
the
same
time
she
was
somewhat
troubled
by
the
thought
that
somehow
the
best
men
in
all
times
of
which
she
had
read
seemed
to
her
to
be
just
those
whom
the
preacher
was
in
fact
denouncing
although
in
words
he
had
praised
them
as
the
great
lights
of
the
church
the
words
which
she
had
heard
in
one
of
the
lessons
kept
running
in
her
head
truly
ye
bear
witness
that
ye
do
allow
the
deeds
of
your
fathers
for
they
indeed
killed
them
but
ye
build
their
sepulchres
but
she
had
little
leisure
to
think
on
the
subject
and
as
her
father
praised
the
sermon
as
a
noble
protest
against
the
fearful
tendencies
of
the
day
to
popery
and
pantheism
smothered
the
questionings
of
her
own
heart
as
well
as
she
could
and
went
off
to
luncheon
in
a
common
room
after
which
her
father
retired
to
their
lodgings
and
she
and
her
cousin
were
escorted
to
afternoon
service
at
magdalen
in
achieving
which
last
feat
they
had
to
encounter
a
crush
only
to
be
equaled
by
that
at
the
pit
entrance
to
the
opera
on
a
jenny
lind
night
but
what
will
not
a
delicately
nurtured
british
lady
go
through
when
her
mind
is
bent
either
on
pleasure
or
duty
poor
tom
feelings
throughout
the
day
may
be
more
easily
conceived
than
described
he
had
called
according
to
order
and
waited
at
their
lodgings
after
breakfast
of
course
they
did
not
arrive
he
had
caught
a
distant
glimpse
of
them
in
mary
but
had
not
been
able
to
approach
he
had
called
again
in
the
afternoon
unsuccessfully
so
far
as
seeing
them
was
concerned
but
he
had
found
his
uncle
at
home
lying
upon
the
sofa
at
first
he
was
much
dismayed
by
this
rencontre
but
recovering
his
presence
mind
he
proceeded
i
regret
to
say
to
take
the
length
of
the
old
gentleman
foot
by
entering
into
a
minute
and
sympathizing
in
quiry
into
the
state
of
his
health
tom
had
no
faith
whatever
in
his
uncle
and
believed
as
many
persons
of
robust
constitution
are
too
apt
to
do
when
brought
face
to
face
with
nervous
patients
that
he
might
shake
off
the
whole
of
his
maladies
at
any
time
by
a
resolute
effort
so
that
his
sympathy
was
all
a
sham
though
perhaps
one
may
pardon
it
considering
the
end
in
view
which
was
that
of
persuading
the
old
gentleman
to
entrust
the
young
ladies
to
his
nephew
care
for
that
evening
in
the
long
walk
and
generally
to
look
upon
his
nephew
thomas
brown
as
his
natural
prop
and
supporter
in
the
university
whose
one
object
in
life
just
now
would
be
to
take
trouble
off
his
hands
and
who
was
of
that
rare
and
precocious
steadiness
of
character
that
he
might
be
as
safely
trusted
as
a
spanish
duenna
to
a
very
considerable
extent
the
victim
fell
into
the
toils
he
had
many
old
friends
at
the
colleges
and
was
very
fond
of
good
dinners
and
long
sittings
afterwards
this
very
evening
he
was
going
to
dine
at
john
and
had
been
much
troubled
at
the
idea
of
having
to
leave
the
unrivalled
old
port
of
that
learned
house
to
escort
his
daughter
and
niece
to
the
long
walk
still
he
was
too
easy
and
not
to
wish
that
they
might
get
there
and
did
not
like
the
notion
of
their
going
with
perfect
strangers
here
was
a
compromise
his
nephew
was
young
but
still
he
was
a
near
relation
and
in
fact
it
gave
the
poor
old
man
a
plausible
excuse
for
not
exerting
himself
as
he
felt
he
ought
to
do
which
was
all
he
ever
required
for
shifting
his
responsibilities
and
duties
upon
other
shoulders
so
tom
waited
quietly
till
the
young
ladies
came
home
which
they
did
just
before
winter
was
getting
impatient
as
soon
as
they
arrived
he
started
for
john
after
advising
them
to
remain
at
home
for
the
evening
as
they
looked
quite
tired
and
knocked
up
but
if
they
resolved
to
go
to
the
long
walk
his
nephew
would
escort
them
how
can
uncle
robert
say
we
look
so
tired
said
mary
consulting
the
glass
on
the
subject
i
feel
quite
fresh
of
course
katie
you
mean
to
go
to
the
long
walk
i
hope
you
will
go
said
tom
i
think
you
owe
me
some
amends
i
came
here
according
to
order
this
morning
and
you
were
not
in
and
i
have
been
trying
to
catch
you
ever
since
we
could
help
it
said
miss
winter
indeed
we
have
not
had
a
minute
to
ourselves
all
day
i
was
very
sorry
to
think
that
we
should
have
brought
you
here
for
nothing
this
morning
but
about
the
long
walk
katie
well
do
you
think
we
have
done
enough
for
i
should
like
to
have
tea
and
sit
quietly
at
home
as
papa
suggested
do
you
feel
very
tired
dear
said
mary
seating
herself
by
her
cousin
on
the
sofa
and
taking
her
hand
no
dear
i
only
want
a
little
quiet
and
a
cup
of
tea
then
let
us
stay
here
quietly
till
it
is
time
to
start
when
ought
we
to
get
to
the
long
walk
about
seven
said
tom
you
should
be
much
later
than
that
there
you
see
katie
we
shall
have
two
hours
perfect
rest
you
shall
lie
upon
the
sofa
and
i
will
read
to
you
and
then
we
shall
go
on
all
fresh
again
miss
winter
smiled
and
said
very
well
she
saw
that
her
cousin
was
bent
on
going
and
she
could
deny
her
nothing
may
i
send
you
in
anything
from
college
said
tom
you
ought
to
have
something
more
than
tea
i
sure
oh
no
thank
you
we
dined
in
the
middle
of
the
day
then
i
may
call
you
about
seven
said
tom
who
had
come
unwillingly
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
better
leave
them
for
the
present
yes
and
mind
you
come
in
good
time
we
mean
to
see
the
whole
sight
remember
we
are
country
cousins
you
must
let
me
call
you
cousin
then
just
for
the
look
of
the
thing
certainly
just
for
the
look
of
the
thing
we
will
be
cousins
till
further
notice
well
you
and
tom
seem
to
get
on
together
mary
said
miss
winter
as
they
heard
the
front
door
close
i
learning
a
lesson
from
you
though
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
put
it
in
practice
what
a
blessing
it
must
be
not
to
be
shy
are
you
shy
then
said
mary
looking
at
her
cousin
with
a
playful
loving
smile
yes
dreadfully
it
is
positive
pain
to
me
to
walk
into
a
room
where
there
are
people
i
do
not
know
but
i
feel
that
too
i
sure
now
you
were
much
less
embarrassed
than
i
last
night
at
the
vice
chancellor
i
quite
envied
you
you
seemed
so
much
at
your
ease
did
i
i
would
have
given
anything
to
be
back
here
quietly
but
it
is
not
the
same
thing
with
you
you
have
no
real
shyness
or
you
would
never
have
got
on
so
fast
with
my
cousin
oh
i
do
feel
at
all
shy
with
him
said
mary
laughing
how
lucky
it
is
that
he
found
us
out
so
soon
i
like
him
so
much
there
is
a
sort
of
way
about
him
as
if
he
could
help
himself
i
am
sure
one
could
turn
him
round
one
finger
do
you
think
so
i
not
so
sure
of
that
but
he
always
was
poor
boy
but
he
is
a
boy
any
longer
you
must
take
care
mary
shall
we
ring
for
tea
chapter
xxvi
the
long
walk
in
christchurch
meadows
do
well
unto
thyself
and
men
will
speak
good
of
thee
is
a
maxim
as
old
as
king
david
time
and
just
as
true
now
as
it
was
then
hardy
had
found
it
so
since
the
publication
of
the
class
list
within
a
few
days
of
that
event
it
was
known
that
his
was
a
very
good
first
his
college
tutor
had
made
his
own
inquiries
and
repeated
on
several
occasions
in
a
confidential
way
the
statement
that
with
the
exception
of
a
want
of
polish
in
his
latin
and
greek
verses
which
we
seldom
get
except
in
the
most
finished
public
school
men
etonians
in
particular
there
has
been
no
better
examination
in
the
schools
for
several
years
the
worthy
tutor
went
on
to
take
glory
to
the
college
and
in
a
lower
degree
to
himself
he
called
attention
in
more
than
one
common
room
to
the
fact
that
hardy
had
never
had
any
private
tuition
but
had
attained
his
intellectual
development
solely
in
the
provided
by
ambrose
college
for
the
training
of
the
youth
entrusted
to
her
he
himself
indeed
he
would
add
had
always
taken
much
interest
in
hardy
and
had
perhaps
done
more
for
him
than
would
be
possible
in
every
case
but
only
with
direct
reference
to
and
in
supplement
of
the
college
course
the
principal
had
taken
marked
and
somewhat
pompous
notice
of
him
and
had
graciously
intimated
his
wish
or
perhaps
i
should
say
his
will
for
he
would
have
been
much
astonished
to
be
told
that
a
wish
of
his
could
count
for
less
than
a
royal
mandate
to
any
man
who
had
been
one
of
his
servitors
that
hardy
should
stand
for
a
fellowship
which
had
lately
fallen
vacant
a
few
weeks
before
this
excessive
affability
and
condescension
of
the
great
man
would
have
wounded
hardy
but
somehow
the
sudden
rush
of
sunshine
and
prosperity
though
it
had
not
thrown
him
off
his
balance
or
changed
his
estimate
of
men
and
things
had
pulled
a
sort
of
comfortable
sheath
over
his
sensitiveness
and
gave
him
a
second
skill
as
it
were
from
which
the
principal
shafts
bounded
off
innocuous
instead
of
piercing
and
rankling
at
first
the
idea
of
standing
for
a
fellowship
at
st
ambrose
was
not
pleasant
to
him
he
felt
inclined
to
open
up
entirely
new
ground
for
himself
and
stand
at
some
other
college
where
he
had
neither
acquaintance
nor
association
but
on
second
thoughts
he
resolved
to
stick
to
his
old
college
moved
thereto
partly
by
the
lamentations
of
tom
when
he
heard
of
his
friends
meditated
emigration
but
chiefly
by
the
unwillingness
to
quit
a
hard
post
for
an
easier
one
which
besets
natures
like
his
to
their
own
discomfort
but
may
one
hope
to
the
single
benefit
of
the
world
at
large
such
men
may
see
clearly
enough
all
the
advantages
of
a
move
of
this
kind
may
quite
appreciate
the
ease
which
it
would
bring
them
may
be
impatient
with
themselves
for
not
making
it
at
once
but
when
it
comes
to
the
actual
leaving
the
old
post
even
though
it
may
be
a
march
out
with
all
the
honours
of
war
drums
beating
and
colors
flying
as
it
would
have
been
in
hardy
case
somehow
or
another
nine
times
out
of
ten
they
throw
up
the
chance
at
the
last
moment
if
not
earlier
pick
up
their
old
arms
growling
perhaps
at
the
price
they
are
paying
to
keep
their
own
and
shoulder
back
into
the
press
to
face
their
old
work
muttering
we
are
asses
we
do
know
what
good
for
us
but
we
must
see
this
job
through
somehow
come
what
may
so
hardy
stayed
on
at
ambrose
waiting
for
the
fellowship
examination
and
certainly
i
am
free
to
confess
not
a
little
enjoying
the
change
in
his
position
and
affairs
he
had
given
up
his
low
dark
back
rooms
to
the
new
servitor
his
successor
to
whom
he
had
presented
all
the
rickety
furniture
except
his
two
windsor
chairs
and
oxford
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
gift
was
not
great
certainly
but
was
of
importance
to
the
poor
raw
boy
who
was
taking
his
place
and
it
was
made
with
the
delicacy
of
one
who
knew
the
situation
good
offices
did
not
stop
here
having
tried
the
bed
himself
for
upwards
of
three
long
years
he
knew
all
the
hard
places
and
was
resolved
while
he
stayed
up
that
they
should
never
chafe
another
occupant
as
they
had
him
so
he
set
himself
to
provide
stuffing
and
took
the
lad
about
with
him
and
cast
a
skirt
of
his
mantle
of
respectability
over
him
and
put
him
in
the
way
of
making
himself
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
allow
never
disguising
from
him
all
the
while
that
the
bed
was
not
to
be
a
bed
of
roses
in
which
pursuit
though
not
yet
a
fellow
perhaps
he
was
qualifying
himself
better
for
a
fellowship
than
he
could
have
done
by
any
amount
of
cramming
for
polish
in
his
versification
not
that
the
electors
of
ambrose
would
be
likely
to
hear
of
or
appreciate
this
kind
of
training
polished
versification
would
no
doubt
have
told
more
in
that
quarter
but
we
who
are
behind
the
scenes
may
disagree
with
them
and
hold
that
he
who
is
thus
acting
out
and
learning
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
is
the
man
for
our
votes
so
hardy
had
left
his
rooms
and
gone
out
of
college
into
lodgings
near
at
hand
the
sword
epaulettes
and
picture
of
his
old
ship
his
tutelary
divinities
as
tom
called
them
occupied
their
accustomed
places
in
his
new
rooms
except
that
there
was
a
over
the
here
by
the
side
of
which
the
sword
hung
instead
of
in
the
centre
as
it
had
done
while
he
had
no
such
luxury
his
windsor
chairs
occupied
each
side
of
the
pleasant
window
of
his
and
already
the
taste
for
luxuries
of
which
he
had
so
often
accused
himself
to
tom
began
to
peep
out
in
the
shape
of
one
or
two
fine
engravings
altogether
fortune
was
smiling
on
hardy
and
he
was
making
the
most
of
her
like
a
wise
man
having
brought
her
round
by
proving
that
he
could
get
on
without
her
and
was
not
going
out
of
the
way
to
gain
her
smiles
several
men
came
at
once
even
before
he
had
taken
his
b
degree
to
read
with
him
and
others
applied
to
know
whether
he
would
take
a
reading
party
in
the
long
vacation
in
short
all
things
went
well
with
hardy
and
the
oxford
world
recognized
the
fact
and
tradesmen
and
college
servants
became
obsequious
and
began
to
bow
before
him
and
recognize
him
as
one
of
their
lords
and
masters
it
was
to
hardy
lodgings
that
tom
repaired
when
he
left
his
cousin
by
blood
and
cousin
by
courtesy
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
for
running
over
in
his
mind
all
his
acquaintance
he
at
once
fixed
upon
hardy
as
the
man
to
accompany
him
in
escorting
the
ladies
to
the
long
walk
besides
being
his
own
most
intimate
friend
hardy
was
the
man
whom
he
would
prefer
to
all
others
to
introduce
to
ladies
now
a
month
ago
it
might
have
been
different
tom
thought
he
was
such
an
old
guy
in
his
dress
but
he
has
smartened
up
and
wears
as
good
a
coat
as
i
do
and
looks
well
enough
for
anybody
though
he
never
will
be
much
of
a
dresser
then
he
will
be
in
a
bachelor
gown
too
which
will
look
respectable
here
you
are
that
all
right
i
so
glad
you
in
he
said
as
he
entered
the
room
now
i
want
you
to
come
to
the
long
walk
with
me
very
well
will
you
call
for
me
yes
and
mind
you
come
in
your
best
old
fellow
we
shall
have
two
of
the
prettiest
girls
who
are
up
with
us
you
wo
want
me
then
they
will
have
plenty
of
escort
not
a
bit
of
it
they
are
deserted
by
their
natural
guardian
my
old
uncle
who
has
gone
out
to
dinner
oh
it
all
right
they
are
my
cousins
more
like
sisters
and
my
uncle
knows
we
are
going
in
fact
it
was
he
who
settled
that
i
should
take
them
yes
but
you
see
i
do
know
them
that
does
matter
i
ca
take
them
both
myself
i
must
have
somebody
with
me
and
i
so
glad
to
get
the
chance
of
introducing
you
to
some
of
my
people
you
know
them
all
i
hope
before
long
of
course
i
should
like
it
very
much
if
you
are
sure
it
all
right
tom
was
perfectly
sure
as
usual
and
so
the
matter
was
arranged
hardy
was
very
much
pleased
and
gratified
at
this
proof
of
his
friend
confidence
and
i
am
not
going
to
say
that
he
did
not
shave
again
and
pay
most
unwonted
attention
to
his
toilet
before
the
hour
fixed
for
tom
return
the
fame
of
brown
lionesses
had
spread
through
ambrose
already
and
hardy
had
heard
of
them
as
well
as
other
men
there
was
something
so
unusual
to
him
in
be
ing
selected
on
such
an
occasion
when
the
smartest
men
in
the
college
were
wishing
and
plotting
for
that
which
came
to
him
unasked
that
he
may
be
pardoned
for
feeling
something
a
little
like
vanity
while
he
adjusted
the
coat
which
tom
had
recently
thought
of
with
such
complacency
and
looked
in
the
glass
to
see
that
his
gown
hung
gracefully
the
effect
on
the
whole
was
so
good
that
tom
was
above
measure
astonished
when
he
came
back
and
could
not
help
indulging
in
some
gentle
chaff
as
they
walked
towards
the
arm
in
arm
the
young
ladies
were
quite
rested
and
sitting
dressed
and
ready
for
their
walk
when
tom
and
hardy
were
announced
and
entered
the
room
miss
winter
rose
up
surprised
and
a
little
embarrassed
at
the
introduction
of
a
total
stranger
in
her
father
absence
but
she
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
as
became
a
young
woman
though
she
secretly
resolved
to
lecture
tom
in
private
as
he
introduced
my
great
friend
hardy
of
our
college
my
cousins
mary
dropped
a
pretty
little
demure
courtesy
lifting
her
eyes
for
one
moment
for
a
glance
at
tom
which
said
as
plain
as
look
could
speak
well
i
must
say
you
are
making
the
most
of
your
relationship
he
was
a
little
put
out
for
a
moment
but
then
recovered
himself
and
said
apologetically
hardy
is
a
bachelor
kate
i
mean
a
bachelor
of
arts
and
he
knows
all
the
people
by
sight
up
here
we
could
have
gone
to
the
walk
without
some
one
to
show
us
the
lions
indeed
i
afraid
you
give
me
too
much
credit
said
hardy
i
know
most
of
our
dons
by
sight
certainly
but
scarcely
any
of
the
visitors
the
awkwardness
of
tom
attempted
explanation
set
everything
wrong
again
then
came
one
of
those
awkward
pauses
which
will
occur
so
very
provokingly
at
the
most
inopportune
times
miss
winter
was
seized
with
one
of
the
uncontrollable
fits
of
shyness
her
bondage
to
which
she
had
so
lately
been
grieving
over
to
mary
and
in
and
without
meaning
in
the
least
to
do
so
drew
himself
up
and
looked
as
proud
as
you
please
hardy
whose
sensitiveness
was
almost
as
keen
as
a
woman
felt
in
a
moment
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
and
became
as
shy
as
miss
winter
herself
if
the
floor
would
have
suddenly
opened
and
let
him
through
into
the
dark
shop
he
would
have
been
thankful
but
as
it
would
not
there
he
stood
meditating
a
sudden
retreat
from
the
room
and
a
tremendous
onslaught
on
tom
as
soon
as
he
could
catch
him
alone
for
getting
him
into
such
a
scrape
tom
was
provoked
with
them
all
for
not
at
once
feeling
at
ease
with
one
another
and
stood
twirling
his
cap
by
the
tassel
and
looking
fiercely
at
it
resolved
not
to
break
the
silence
he
had
been
at
all
the
trouble
of
bringing
about
this
charming
situation
and
now
nobody
seemed
to
like
it
or
to
know
what
to
say
or
do
they
ought
to
get
themselves
out
of
it
as
they
could
for
anything
he
cared
he
was
not
going
to
bother
himself
any
more
mary
looked
in
the
glass
to
see
that
her
bonnet
was
quite
right
and
then
from
one
to
another
of
her
companions
in
a
little
wonder
at
their
unaccountable
behavior
and
a
little
pique
that
two
young
men
should
be
standing
there
like
unpleasant
images
and
not
availing
themselves
of
the
privilege
of
trying
at
least
to
make
themselves
agreeable
to
her
luckily
however
for
the
party
the
humorous
side
of
the
tableau
struck
her
with
great
force
so
that
when
tom
lifted
his
misanthropic
eyes
for
a
moment
and
caught
hers
they
were
so
full
of
fun
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
allow
herself
not
without
a
struggle
to
break
first
into
a
smile
and
then
into
a
laugh
this
brought
all
eyes
to
bear
on
him
and
the
ice
being
once
broken
dissolved
as
quickly
as
it
had
gathered
i
really
ca
see
what
there
is
to
laugh
at
tom
said
miss
winter
smiling
herself
nevertheless
and
blushing
a
little
as
she
worked
or
pretended
to
work
at
buttoning
one
of
her
gloves
ca
you
kate
well
then
is
it
very
ridiculous
and
enough
to
make
one
laugh
that
we
four
should
be
standing
here
in
a
sort
of
quaker
meeting
when
we
ought
to
be
to
the
long
walk
by
this
time
oh
do
let
us
start
said
mary
i
know
we
shall
be
missing
all
the
best
of
the
sight
come
along
then
said
tom
leading
the
way
down
stairs
and
hardy
and
the
ladies
followed
and
they
descended
into
the
high
street
walking
all
abreast
the
two
ladies
together
with
a
gentleman
on
either
flank
this
formation
answered
well
enough
on
high
street
the
broad
pavement
of
that
celebrated
thoroughfare
being
favourable
to
an
advance
in
line
but
when
they
had
wheeled
into
oriel
lane
the
narrow
pavement
at
once
threw
the
line
into
confusion
and
after
one
or
two
fruitless
attempts
to
take
up
the
dressing
they
settled
down
into
the
more
natural
formation
of
close
column
of
couples
the
leading
couple
consisting
of
mary
and
tom
and
the
remaining
couple
of
miss
winter
and
hardy
it
was
a
lovely
midsummer
evening
and
oxford
was
looking
her
best
under
the
genial
cloudless
sky
so
that
what
with
the
usual
congratulations
on
the
weather
and
explanatory
remarks
on
the
buildings
as
they
passed
along
hardy
managed
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
his
companion
without
much
difficulty
miss
winter
was
pleased
with
his
quiet
deferential
manner
and
soon
lost
her
feeling
of
shyness
and
before
hardy
had
come
to
the
end
of
such
remarks
as
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
she
was
taking
her
fair
share
in
the
talk
in
describing
their
day
doings
she
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
the
beauty
of
magdalen
chapel
and
betrayed
a
little
knowledge
of
traceries
and
mouldings
which
gave
an
opening
to
her
companion
to
travel
out
of
the
weather
and
the
names
of
colleges
church
architecture
was
just
one
of
the
subjects
which
was
sure
at
that
time
to
take
more
or
less
hold
on
every
man
at
oxford
whose
mind
was
open
to
the
influences
of
the
place
hardy
had
read
the
usual
and
kept
his
eyes
open
as
he
walked
about
the
town
and
neighborhood
to
miss
winter
he
seemed
so
learned
on
the
subject
that
she
began
to
doubt
his
tendencies
and
was
glad
to
be
reassured
by
some
remarks
which
fell
from
him
as
to
the
university
sermon
which
she
had
heard
she
was
glad
to
find
that
her
cousin
most
intimate
friend
was
not
likely
to
lead
him
into
the
errors
of
tractarianism
meantime
the
leading
couple
were
getting
on
satisfactorily
in
their
own
way
is
it
good
of
uncle
robert
he
says
that
he
shall
feel
quite
comfortable
as
long
as
you
and
katie
are
with
me
in
fact
i
feel
quite
responsible
already
like
an
old
dragon
in
a
watching
a
treasure
yes
but
what
does
katie
say
to
being
made
a
treasure
of
she
has
to
think
a
good
deal
for
herself
and
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
quite
certain
of
being
our
sole
knight
and
guardian
because
uncle
robert
wants
to
get
rid
of
us
poor
old
uncle
but
you
would
object
then
oh
dear
no
at
least
not
unless
you
take
to
looking
as
cross
as
you
did
just
now
in
our
lodgings
of
course
all
for
dragons
who
are
mad
about
dancing
and
never
think
of
leaving
a
till
the
band
packs
up
and
the
old
man
shuffles
in
to
put
out
the
lights
then
i
shall
be
a
model
dragon
said
tom
hours
earlier
he
had
declared
that
nothing
should
induce
him
to
go
to
the
balls
but
his
views
on
the
subject
had
been
greatly
modified
and
he
had
been
worrying
all
his
acquaintance
not
unsuccessfully
for
the
necessary
tickets
ever
since
his
talk
with
his
cousins
on
the
preceding
evening
the
scene
became
more
and
more
gay
and
lively
as
they
passed
out
of
christchurch
towards
the
long
walk
the
town
turned
out
to
take
its
share
in
the
show
and
citizens
of
all
ranks
the
poorer
ones
accompanied
by
children
of
all
ages
trooped
along
cheek
by
jowl
with
members
of
the
university
of
all
degrees
and
their
visitors
somewhat
indeed
to
the
disgust
of
certain
of
these
latter
many
of
whom
declared
that
the
whole
thing
was
spoilt
by
the
miscellaneousness
of
the
crowd
and
that
those
sort
of
people
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
come
to
the
long
walk
on
show
sunday
however
those
sort
of
people
abounded
nevertheless
and
seemed
to
enjoy
very
much
in
sober
fashion
the
solemn
march
up
and
down
beneath
the
grand
avenue
of
elms
in
the
midst
of
their
betters
the
university
was
there
in
strength
from
the
downwards
somehow
or
another
though
it
might
seem
an
unreasonable
thing
at
first
sight
for
grave
and
reverend
persons
to
do
yet
most
of
the
gravest
of
them
found
some
reason
for
taking
a
turn
in
the
long
walk
as
for
the
undergraduates
they
turned
out
almost
to
a
man
and
none
of
them
more
certainly
than
the
young
gentlemen
elaborately
dressed
who
had
sneered
at
the
whole
ceremony
as
snobbish
an
hour
or
two
before
as
for
our
hero
he
sailed
into
the
meadows
thoroughly
satisfied
for
the
moment
with
himself
and
his
convoy
he
had
every
reason
to
be
so
for
though
there
were
many
gayer
and
more
fashionably
dressed
ladies
present
than
his
cousin
and
cousin
by
courtesy
there
were
none
there
whose
faces
figures
and
dresses
carried
more
unmistakably
the
marks
of
that
thorough
quiet
high
breeding
that
refinement
which
is
no
mere
surface
polish
and
that
fearless
unconsciousness
which
looks
out
from
pure
hearts
which
are
still
thank
god
to
be
found
in
so
many
homes
of
the
english
gentry
the
long
walk
was
filling
rapidly
and
at
every
paces
tom
was
greeted
by
some
of
his
friends
or
acquaintance
and
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
them
but
he
allowed
them
one
after
another
to
pass
by
without
effecting
any
introduction
you
seem
to
have
a
great
many
acquaintances
said
his
companion
upon
whom
none
of
these
salutations
were
lost
yes
of
course
one
gets
to
know
a
great
many
men
up
here
it
must
be
very
pleasant
but
does
it
not
interfere
a
great
deal
with
your
reading
no
because
one
meets
them
at
lectures
and
in
hall
and
chapel
besides
he
added
in
a
sudden
fit
of
honesty
it
is
my
first
year
one
does
read
much
in
one
first
year
it
is
a
much
harder
thing
than
people
think
to
take
to
reading
except
just
before
an
examination
but
your
great
friend
who
is
walking
with
katie
what
did
you
say
his
name
is
hardy
well
he
is
a
great
scholar
did
you
say
yes
he
has
just
taken
a
first
class
he
is
the
best
man
of
his
year
how
proud
you
must
be
of
him
i
suppose
now
he
is
a
great
reader
yes
he
is
great
at
everything
he
is
nearly
the
best
oar
in
our
boat
by
the
way
you
will
come
to
the
procession
of
boats
night
we
are
the
head
boat
on
the
river
oh
i
hope
so
is
it
a
pretty
sight
let
us
ask
katie
about
it
it
is
the
finest
sight
in
the
world
said
tom
who
had
never
seen
it
eight
oars
with
their
flags
flying
and
all
the
crews
in
uniform
you
see
the
barges
over
there
moored
along
the
side
of
the
river
you
will
sit
on
one
of
them
as
we
pass
yes
i
think
i
do
said
mary
looking
across
the
meadow
in
the
direction
in
which
he
pointed
you
mean
those
great
gilded
things
but
i
do
see
the
river
shall
we
walk
round
there
it
wo
take
up
ten
minutes
but
we
must
not
leave
the
walk
and
all
the
people
it
is
so
amusing
here
then
you
will
wear
our
colors
at
the
procession
yes
if
katie
does
mind
at
least
if
they
are
pretty
what
are
your
colors
blue
and
white
i
will
get
you
some
ribbons
morning
very
well
and
i
will
make
them
up
into
rosettes
why
do
you
know
them
asked
tom
as
she
bowed
to
two
gentlemen
in
masters
caps
and
gowns
whom
they
met
in
the
crowd
yes
at
least
we
met
them
last
night
but
do
you
know
who
they
are
oh
yes
they
were
introduced
to
us
and
i
talked
a
great
deal
to
them
and
katie
scolded
me
for
it
when
we
got
home
no
i
wo
say
scolded
me
but
looked
very
grave
over
it
they
are
two
of
the
leaders
of
the
tractarians
yes
that
was
the
fun
of
it
katie
was
so
pleased
and
interested
with
them
at
first
much
more
than
i
was
but
when
she
found
out
who
they
were
she
fairly
ran
away
and
i
stayed
and
talked
on
i
do
think
they
said
anything
very
dangerous
perhaps
one
of
them
wrote
no
do
you
know
i
dare
say
but
i
do
know
much
about
it
however
they
must
have
a
bad
time
of
it
i
should
think
up
here
with
the
old
dons
but
do
you
think
one
likes
people
who
are
persecuted
i
declare
i
would
listen
to
them
for
an
hour
though
i
understand
a
word
just
to
show
them
that
i
was
afraid
of
them
and
sympathized
with
them
how
can
people
be
so
i
sure
they
only
write
what
they
believe
and
think
will
do
good
that
just
what
most
of
us
feel
said
tom
we
hate
to
see
them
put
down
because
they
do
agree
with
the
swells
up
here
you
see
how
they
will
be
cheered
in
the
theatre
then
they
are
not
unpopular
and
persecuted
after
all
oh
yes
by
the
dons
and
that
why
we
all
like
them
from
you
see
because
the
dons
bully
them
and
us
equally
but
i
thought
they
were
dons
too
well
so
they
are
but
not
regular
dons
you
know
like
the
proctors
and
deans
and
that
sort
his
companion
did
not
understand
this
delicate
distinction
but
was
too
much
interested
in
watching
the
crowd
to
inquire
further
presently
they
met
two
of
the
heads
of
houses
walking
with
several
strangers
everyone
was
noticing
them
when
they
passed
and
of
course
tom
was
questioned
as
to
who
they
were
not
being
prepared
with
an
answer
he
appealed
to
hardy
who
was
just
behind
them
talking
to
miss
winter
they
were
some
of
the
celebrities
on
whom
honorary
degrees
were
to
be
conferred
hardy
said
a
famous
american
author
a
foreign
ambassador
a
indian
soldier
and
others
then
came
some
more
one
of
whom
this
time
bowed
to
miss
winter
who
was
that
katie
one
of
the
gentlemen
we
met
last
night
i
did
not
catch
his
name
but
he
was
very
agreeable
oh
i
remember
you
were
talking
to
him
for
a
long
time
after
you
ran
away
from
me
i
was
very
curious
to
know
what
you
were
saying
you
seemed
so
interested
well
you
seem
to
have
made
the
most
of
your
time
last
night
said
tom
i
should
have
thought
katie
you
would
hardly
have
approved
of
him
either
but
who
is
he
why
the
most
dangerous
man
in
oxford
what
do
they
call
him
a
germanizer
and
a
rationalist
is
it
hardy
yes
i
believe
so
said
hardy
oh
think
of
that
there
katie
you
had
much
better
have
stayed
by
me
after
all
a
germanizer
did
you
say
what
a
hard
word
it
must
be
much
worse
than
tractarian
is
it
now
mary
dear
pray
take
care
everybody
will
hear
you
said
miss
winter
i
wish
i
thought
that
everybody
would
listen
to
me
replied
miss
mary
but
i
really
will
be
quiet
katie
only
i
must
know
which
is
the
worst
my
tractarians
or
your
germanizer
oh
the
germanizer
of
course
said
tom
but
why
said
hardy
who
could
do
no
less
than
break
a
lance
for
his
companion
moreover
he
happened
to
have
strong
convictions
on
these
subjects
why
because
one
knows
the
worst
of
where
the
tractarians
are
going
they
may
go
to
rome
and
there
an
end
of
it
but
the
germanizers
are
going
into
the
abysses
or
no
one
knows
where
there
katie
you
hear
i
hope
interrupted
miss
mary
coming
to
her
companion
rescue
before
hardy
could
bring
his
artillery
to
bear
but
what
a
terrible
place
oxford
must
be
i
declare
it
seems
quite
full
of
people
whom
it
is
unsafe
to
talk
with
i
wish
it
were
if
they
were
all
like
miss
winter
friend
said
hardy
and
then
the
crowd
thickened
and
they
dropped
behind
again
tom
was
getting
to
think
more
of
his
companion
and
less
of
himself
every
minute
when
he
was
suddenly
confronted
in
the
walk
by
benjamin
the
jew
smoking
a
cigar
and
dressed
in
a
gaudy
figured
satin
waistcoat
and
waterfall
of
the
same
material
and
resplendent
with
jewelry
he
had
business
to
attend
to
in
oxford
at
this
time
of
the
year
nothing
escaped
the
eyes
of
tom
companion
who
was
that
she
said
what
a
man
surely
he
bowed
as
if
he
knew
you
i
dare
say
he
is
impudent
enough
for
anything
said
tom
but
who
is
he
oh
a
rascally
fellow
who
sells
bad
cigars
and
worse
wine
tom
equanimity
was
much
shaken
by
the
apparition
of
the
jew
the
remembrance
of
the
bill
scene
at
the
public
house
in
the
and
the
unsatisfactory
prospect
in
that
matter
with
blake
plucked
and
drysdale
no
longer
a
member
of
the
university
and
utterly
careless
as
to
his
liabilities
came
across
him
and
made
him
silent
and
absent
he
answered
at
hazard
to
his
companion
remarks
for
the
next
minute
or
two
until
after
some
particularly
inappropriate
reply
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
steady
wide
open
eyes
which
brought
him
to
himself
or
rather
drove
him
into
himself
in
no
time
i
really
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
was
very
rude
i
fear
it
is
so
strange
to
me
to
be
walking
here
with
ladies
what
were
you
saying
nothing
of
any
consequence
i
really
forget
but
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
for
you
to
walk
with
ladies
here
strange
i
should
think
it
was
i
have
never
seen
a
lady
that
i
knew
up
here
till
you
came
indeed
but
there
must
be
plenty
of
ladies
living
in
oxford
i
do
believe
there
are
at
least
we
never
see
them
then
you
ought
to
be
on
your
best
behavior
when
we
do
come
i
shall
expect
you
now
to
listen
to
everything
i
say
and
to
answer
my
silliest
questions
oh
you
ought
not
to
be
so
hard
on
us
you
mean
that
you
find
it
hard
to
answer
silly
questions
how
wise
you
must
all
grow
living
up
here
together
perhaps
but
the
wisdom
does
come
down
to
the
men
and
so
well
why
do
you
stop
because
i
was
going
to
say
something
you
might
not
like
then
i
insist
on
hearing
it
now
i
shall
not
let
you
off
you
were
saying
that
wisdom
does
not
come
so
low
as
men
and
so
what
and
so
and
so
they
are
not
wise
yes
of
course
but
that
was
not
what
you
were
going
to
say
and
so
and
so
they
are
generally
agreeable
for
wise
people
are
always
dull
and
so
ladies
ought
to
avoid
the
dons
and
not
avoid
men
exactly
so
because
they
are
foolish
and
therefore
fit
company
for
ladies
now
really
no
no
because
they
are
foolish
and
therefore
they
ought
to
be
made
wise
and
ladies
are
wiser
than
dons
and
therefore
duller
for
all
wise
people
you
said
were
dull
not
all
wise
people
only
people
who
are
wise
by
cramming
as
dons
but
ladies
are
wise
by
inspiration
and
men
are
they
foolish
by
inspiration
and
agreeable
by
cramming
or
agreeable
by
inspiration
and
foolish
by
cramming
they
are
agreeable
by
inspiration
in
the
society
of
ladies
then
they
can
never
be
agreeable
for
you
say
they
never
see
ladies
not
with
the
bodily
eye
but
with
the
eye
of
fancy
then
their
agreeableness
must
be
all
fancy
but
it
is
better
to
be
agreeable
in
fancy
than
dull
in
reality
that
depends
upon
whose
fancy
it
is
to
be
agreeable
in
your
own
fancy
is
compatible
with
being
dull
in
reality
as
how
you
play
with
words
i
see
you
wo
leave
me
a
shred
either
of
fancy
or
agreeableness
to
stand
on
then
i
shall
do
you
good
service
i
shall
destroy
your
illusions
you
can
not
stand
on
illusions
but
remember
what
my
illusions
were
fancy
and
agreeableness
but
your
agreeableness
stood
on
fancy
and
your
fancy
on
nothing
you
had
better
settle
down
at
once
on
the
solid
basis
of
dullness
like
the
dons
then
i
am
to
found
myself
on
fact
and
try
to
be
dull
what
a
conclusion
but
perhaps
dullness
is
no
more
a
fact
than
fancy
what
is
dullness
oh
i
do
not
undertake
to
define
you
are
the
best
judge
how
severe
you
are
now
see
how
generous
i
am
dullness
in
society
is
the
absence
of
ladies
alas
poor
oxford
who
is
that
in
the
velvet
sleeves
why
do
you
touch
your
cap
that
is
the
proctor
he
is
our
cerberus
he
has
to
keep
all
undergraduates
in
good
order
what
a
task
he
ought
to
have
three
heads
he
has
only
one
head
but
it
is
a
very
long
one
and
he
has
a
tail
like
any
basha
composed
of
marshals
and
and
i
do
know
what
all
but
to
go
back
to
what
we
were
saying
no
do
let
us
go
back
i
tired
of
it
besides
you
were
just
beginning
about
dullness
how
can
you
expect
me
to
listen
now
oh
but
do
listen
just
for
two
minutes
will
you
be
serious
i
do
want
to
know
what
you
really
think
when
you
hear
the
case
well
i
will
try
for
two
minutes
mind
upon
gaining
which
permission
tom
went
off
into
an
interesting
discourse
on
the
unnaturalness
of
men
lives
at
oxford
which
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
inflict
on
our
readers
as
he
was
waxing
eloquent
and
sentimental
he
chanced
to
look
from
his
companion
face
for
a
moment
in
search
of
a
simile
when
his
eyes
alighted
on
that
virtuous
member
of
society
dick
the
factotum
of
the
choughs
who
was
taking
his
turn
in
the
long
walk
with
his
betters
dick
face
was
twisted
into
an
uncomfortable
grin
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
tom
and
his
companion
and
he
made
a
sort
of
half
motion
towards
touching
his
hat
but
could
quite
carry
it
through
and
so
passed
by
ah
ai
he
a
going
of
it
again
he
muttered
to
himself
jest
like
all
tom
did
hear
the
words
but
the
look
had
been
quite
enough
for
him
and
he
broke
off
short
in
his
speech
and
turned
his
head
away
and
after
two
or
three
flounderings
which
mary
seemed
not
to
notice
stopped
short
and
let
miss
winter
and
hardy
join
them
it
getting
dark
he
said
as
they
came
up
the
walk
is
thinning
ought
we
not
to
be
going
remember
i
am
in
charge
yes
i
think
it
is
time
at
this
moment
the
great
christchurch
bell
tom
by
name
began
to
toll
surely
that
ca
be
tom
miss
winter
said
who
had
heard
the
one
hundred
and
one
strokes
on
former
occasions
indeed
it
is
though
but
how
very
light
it
is
it
is
almost
the
longest
day
in
the
year
and
there
has
been
a
cloud
all
day
they
started
to
walk
home
all
together
and
tom
gradually
recovered
himself
but
left
the
labouring
oar
to
hardy
who
did
his
work
very
well
and
persuaded
the
ladies
to
go
on
and
see
the
ratcliffe
by
moonlight
the
only
time
to
see
it
as
he
said
because
of
the
shadows
and
just
to
look
in
at
the
old
quadrangle
of
ambrose
it
was
almost
ten
when
they
stopped
at
the
lodgings
in
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
opened
hardy
said
i
really
must
apologize
miss
winter
to
you
for
my
intrusion
i
hope
your
father
will
allow
me
to
call
on
him
oh
yes
pray
do
he
will
be
so
glad
to
see
any
friend
of
my
cousin
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
to
him
or
to
you
or
your
sister
my
sister
oh
you
mean
mary
she
is
not
my
sister
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
hope
you
will
let
me
know
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
indeed
we
will
now
mary
papa
will
be
worrying
about
us
and
so
the
young
ladies
said
their
adieus
and
disappeared
surely
you
told
me
they
were
sisters
said
hardy
as
the
two
walked
away
towards
college
no
did
i
i
do
remember
but
they
are
your
cousins
yes
at
least
katie
is
do
you
like
her
of
course
one
ca
help
liking
her
but
she
says
you
have
not
met
for
two
years
or
more
no
more
we
have
then
i
suppose
you
have
seen
more
of
her
companion
lately
well
if
you
must
know
i
never
saw
her
before
yesterday
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
took
me
in
there
tonight
when
you
had
never
seen
one
of
the
young
ladies
before
and
the
other
not
for
two
years
well
upon
my
word
brown
now
do
blow
me
up
old
fellow
please
do
there
i
give
in
do
hit
a
fellow
when
he
down
i
so
low
tom
spoke
in
such
a
depreciating
tone
that
hardy
wrath
passed
away
why
what
the
matter
he
said
you
seemed
to
be
full
of
talk
i
was
envying
your
fluency
i
know
often
talk
yes
so
i
was
but
did
you
see
dick
in
the
walk
you
have
never
heard
anything
more
no
but
no
news
is
good
news
heigho
i
awfully
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
let
me
come
up
come
along
then
and
so
they
disappeared
into
hardy
lodgings
the
two
young
ladies
meanwhile
soothed
old
winter
who
had
eaten
and
drank
more
than
was
good
for
him
and
was
naturally
put
out
thereby
they
soon
managed
to
persuade
him
to
retire
and
then
followed
first
to
mary
room
where
that
young
lady
burst
out
at
once
what
a
charming
place
it
is
oh
you
enjoy
your
evening
katie
yes
but
i
felt
a
little
awkward
without
a
chaperone
you
seemed
to
get
on
very
well
with
my
cousin
you
scarcely
spoke
to
us
in
the
long
walk
till
just
before
we
came
away
what
were
you
talking
about
mary
burst
into
a
gay
laugh
all
sorts
of
nonsense
she
said
i
do
think
i
ever
talked
so
much
nonsense
in
my
life
i
hope
he
is
shocked
i
do
think
he
is
but
i
said
anything
that
came
into
my
head
i
could
help
it
you
do
think
it
wrong
wrong
dear
no
i
sure
you
could
say
nothing
wrong
i
not
so
sure
of
that
but
katie
dear
i
know
there
is
something
on
his
mind
why
do
you
think
so
oh
because
he
stopped
short
twice
and
became
quite
absent
and
seemed
not
to
hear
anything
i
said
how
odd
i
never
knew
him
do
so
did
you
see
any
reason
for
it
no
unless
it
was
two
men
we
passed
in
the
crowd
one
was
a
wretch
who
was
smoking
a
fat
black
thing
with
such
a
thick
nose
covered
with
jewelry
not
his
nose
dear
no
but
his
dress
and
the
other
was
a
homely
little
man
like
one
of
your
englebourn
troubles
i
sure
there
is
some
mystery
about
them
and
i
shall
find
it
out
but
how
did
you
like
his
friend
katie
very
much
indeed
i
was
rather
uncomfortable
at
walking
so
long
with
a
stranger
but
he
was
very
pleasant
and
is
so
fond
of
tom
i
am
sure
he
is
a
very
good
friend
for
him
he
looks
a
good
man
but
how
ugly
do
you
think
so
we
shall
have
a
hard
day
good
night
dear
good
night
katie
but
i
do
feel
a
bit
sleepy
and
so
the
cousins
kissed
one
another
and
miss
winter
went
to
her
own
room
chapter
xxvii
lecturing
a
lioness
the
evening
of
show
sunday
may
serve
as
a
fair
sample
of
what
this
eventful
commemoration
was
to
our
hero
the
constant
intercourse
with
ladies
with
such
ladies
as
miss
winter
and
mary
young
well
spoken
and
creditable
in
all
ways
was
very
delightful
and
the
more
fascinating
from
the
sudden
change
which
their
presence
wrought
in
the
ordinary
mode
of
life
of
the
place
they
would
have
been
charming
in
any
room
but
were
quite
irrepressible
in
his
den
which
no
female
presence
except
that
of
his
blowsy
old
had
lightened
since
he
had
been
in
possession
all
the
associations
of
the
room
were
raised
at
once
when
he
came
in
at
night
now
he
could
look
sentimentally
at
his
arm
chair
christened
the
captain
after
captain
hardy
on
which
katie
had
sat
to
make
breakfast
or
at
the
brass
peg
on
the
door
on
which
mary
had
hung
her
bonnet
and
shawl
after
displacing
his
gown
his
very
teacups
and
saucers
which
were
already
a
miscellaneous
set
of
several
different
patterns
had
made
a
move
almost
into
his
affections
at
least
the
two
one
brown
one
blue
which
the
young
ladies
had
used
a
human
interest
belonged
to
them
now
and
they
were
no
longer
mere
crockery
he
had
thought
of
buying
two
very
pretty
china
ones
the
most
expensive
he
could
find
in
oxford
and
getting
them
to
use
these
for
the
first
time
but
rejected
the
idea
the
fine
new
ones
he
felt
would
never
be
the
same
to
him
they
had
come
in
and
used
his
own
rubbish
that
was
the
great
charm
if
he
had
been
going
to
give
cups
no
material
would
have
been
beautiful
enough
but
for
his
own
use
after
them
the
commoner
the
better
the
material
was
nothing
the
association
everything
it
is
marvellous
the
amount
of
healthy
sentiment
of
which
a
naturally
undergraduate
is
capable
by
the
end
of
the
summer
term
but
sentiment
is
not
all
the
delights
which
spring
from
sudden
intimacy
with
the
fairest
and
best
part
of
the
creation
are
as
far
above
those
of
the
ordinary
unmitigated
undergraduate
life
as
the
british
citizen
of
is
above
the
rudimentary
personage
in
prehistoric
times
from
whom
he
has
been
gradually
improved
up
to
his
present
state
of
enlightenment
and
perfection
but
each
state
has
also
its
own
troubles
as
well
as
its
pleasures
and
though
the
former
are
a
price
which
no
decent
fellow
would
boggle
at
for
a
moment
it
is
useless
to
pretend
that
paying
them
is
pleasant
now
at
commemoration
as
elsewhere
where
men
do
congregate
if
your
are
not
pretty
or
agreeable
enough
to
make
your
friends
and
acquaintances
eager
to
know
them
and
to
cater
for
their
enjoyment
and
try
in
all
ways
to
win
their
favor
and
cut
you
out
you
have
the
sat
isfaction
at
any
rate
of
keeping
them
to
yourself
though
you
lose
the
pleasures
which
arise
from
being
sought
after
and
made
much
of
for
their
sakes
and
feeling
raised
above
the
ruck
of
your
neighbors
on
the
other
hand
if
they
are
all
like
this
you
might
as
well
try
to
keep
the
sunshine
and
air
to
yourself
universal
human
nature
rises
up
against
you
and
besides
they
will
not
stand
it
themselves
and
indeed
why
should
they
women
to
be
very
attractive
to
all
sorts
of
different
people
must
have
great
readiness
of
sympathy
many
have
it
naturally
and
many
work
hard
in
acquiring
a
good
imitation
of
it
in
the
first
case
it
is
against
the
nature
of
such
persons
to
be
monopolized
for
more
than
a
very
short
time
in
the
second
all
their
trouble
would
be
thrown
away
if
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
monopolized
once
in
their
lives
indeed
they
will
be
and
ought
to
be
and
that
monopoly
lasts
or
should
last
forever
but
instead
of
destroying
in
them
that
which
was
their
great
charm
it
only
deepens
and
widens
it
and
the
sympathy
which
was
before
fitful
and
perhaps
wayward
flows
on
in
a
calm
and
healthy
stream
blessing
and
cheering
all
who
come
within
reach
of
its
exhilarating
and
waters
but
man
of
all
ages
is
a
selfish
animal
and
unreasonable
in
his
selfishness
it
takes
every
one
of
us
in
turn
many
a
shrewd
fall
in
our
wrestlings
with
the
world
to
convince
us
that
we
are
not
to
have
everything
our
own
way
we
are
conscious
in
our
inmost
souls
that
man
is
the
rightful
lord
of
creation
and
starting
from
this
eternal
principle
and
ignoring
each
of
us
in
turn
the
qualifying
truth
that
it
is
to
man
in
general
including
women
and
not
to
thomas
brown
in
particular
that
the
earth
has
been
given
we
set
about
asserting
our
kingships
each
in
his
own
way
and
proclaiming
ourselves
kings
from
our
little
of
thrones
and
then
come
the
strugglings
and
the
and
some
of
us
learn
our
lesson
and
some
learn
it
not
but
what
lesson
that
we
have
been
dreaming
in
the
golden
hours
when
the
vision
of
a
kingdom
rose
before
us
that
there
is
in
short
no
kingdom
at
all
or
that
if
there
be
we
are
no
heirs
of
it
no
i
take
it
that
while
we
make
nothing
better
than
that
out
of
our
lesson
we
shall
have
to
go
on
spelling
at
it
and
stumbling
over
it
through
all
the
days
of
our
life
till
we
make
our
last
stumble
and
take
our
final
header
out
of
this
riddle
of
a
world
which
we
once
dreamed
we
were
to
rule
over
exclaiming
vanitas
vanitatum
to
the
end
but
man
spirit
will
never
be
satisfied
without
a
kingdom
and
was
never
intended
to
be
satisfied
so
and
one
wiser
than
solomon
tells
us
day
by
day
that
our
kingdom
is
about
us
here
and
that
we
may
rise
up
and
pass
in
when
we
will
at
the
shining
gates
which
he
holds
open
for
that
it
is
his
and
we
are
joint
heirs
of
it
with
him
on
the
whole
however
making
allowances
for
all
drawbacks
those
commemoration
days
were
the
pleasantest
days
tom
had
ever
known
at
oxford
he
was
with
his
uncle
and
cousins
early
and
late
devising
all
sorts
of
pleasant
entertainments
and
excursions
for
them
introducing
all
the
pleasantest
men
of
his
acquaintance
and
taxing
the
resources
of
the
college
which
at
such
times
were
available
for
undergraduates
as
well
as
their
betters
to
minister
to
their
comfort
and
enjoyment
and
he
was
well
repaid
there
was
something
perfectly
new
to
the
ladies
and
very
piquaut
in
the
life
and
habits
of
the
place
they
found
it
very
diverting
to
be
receiving
in
tom
rooms
presiding
over
his
breakfasts
and
luncheons
altering
the
position
of
his
furniture
and
making
the
place
look
as
pretty
as
circumstances
would
allow
then
there
was
pleasant
occupation
for
every
spare
hour
and
the
fetes
and
amusements
were
all
unlike
everything
but
themselves
of
course
the
ladies
at
once
became
enthusiastic
ambrosians
and
managed
in
spite
of
all
distractions
to
find
time
for
making
up
rosettes
and
bows
of
blue
and
white
in
which
to
appear
at
the
procession
of
the
boats
which
was
the
great
event
of
the
monday
fortunately
winter
had
been
a
good
oar
in
his
day
and
had
pulled
in
one
of
the
first
in
which
the
university
races
had
commenced
some
years
before
and
tom
who
had
set
his
mind
on
managing
his
uncle
worked
him
up
almost
into
enthusiasm
and
forgetfulness
of
his
maladies
so
that
he
raised
no
objection
to
a
five
dinner
and
an
adjournment
to
the
river
almost
immediately
afterwards
jervis
who
was
on
the
river
at
tom
instigation
got
an
for
him
in
the
best
part
of
the
university
barge
while
the
ladies
after
walking
along
the
bank
with
tom
and
others
of
the
crew
and
being
instructed
in
the
colors
of
the
different
boats
and
the
meaning
of
the
ceremony
took
their
places
in
the
front
row
on
the
top
of
the
barge
beneath
the
awning
and
the
flags
and
looked
down
with
hundreds
of
other
fair
strangers
on
the
scene
which
certainly
merited
all
that
tom
had
said
of
it
on
faith
the
barges
above
and
below
the
university
barge
which
occupied
the
post
of
honor
were
also
covered
with
ladies
and
christchurch
meadow
swarmed
with
gay
dresses
and
caps
and
gowns
on
the
opposite
side
the
bank
was
lined
with
a
crowd
in
holiday
clothes
and
the
punts
plied
across
without
intermission
loaded
with
people
till
the
groups
stretched
away
down
the
towing
path
in
an
almost
continuous
line
to
the
starting
place
then
one
after
another
of
the
all
painted
and
polished
up
for
the
occasion
with
the
college
flags
drooping
at
their
sterns
put
out
and
passed
down
to
their
stations
and
the
bands
played
and
the
sun
shone
his
best
and
then
after
a
short
pause
of
expectation
the
distant
bank
became
all
alive
and
the
groups
all
turned
one
way
and
came
up
the
towing
path
again
and
the
foremost
boat
with
the
blue
and
white
flag
shot
through
the
gut
and
came
up
the
reach
followed
by
another
and
another
and
another
till
they
were
tired
of
counting
and
the
leading
boat
was
already
close
to
them
before
the
last
had
come
within
sight
and
the
bands
played
up
all
together
and
the
crowd
on
both
sides
cheered
as
the
ambrose
boat
spurted
from
the
cherwell
and
took
the
place
of
honor
at
the
opposite
the
university
barge
and
close
under
where
they
were
sitting
oh
look
katie
dear
here
they
are
there
tom
and
hardy
and
jervis
and
mary
waved
her
handkerchief
and
clapped
her
hands
and
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
enthusiasm
in
which
her
cousin
was
no
whit
behind
her
the
gallant
crew
of
ambrose
were
by
no
means
unconscious
of
and
fully
appreciated
the
compliment
then
the
boats
passed
up
one
by
one
and
as
each
came
opposite
to
the
ambrose
boat
the
crews
tossed
their
oars
and
cheered
and
the
ambrose
crew
tossed
their
oars
and
cheered
in
return
and
the
whole
ceremony
went
off
in
triumph
notwithstanding
the
casualty
which
occurred
to
one
of
the
torpids
the
torpids
being
filled
with
the
refuse
of
the
rowing
men
generally
awkward
or
very
young
oarsmen
find
some
difficulty
in
the
act
of
tossing
no
safe
operation
for
an
unsteady
crew
accordingly
the
torpid
in
question
having
sustained
her
crew
gallantly
till
the
saluting
point
and
allowed
them
to
get
their
oars
fairly
into
the
air
proceeded
gravely
to
turn
over
on
her
side
and
shoot
them
out
into
the
stream
a
thrill
ran
along
the
top
of
the
barges
and
a
little
scream
or
two
might
have
been
heard
even
through
the
notes
of
annie
laurie
which
were
filling
the
air
at
the
moment
but
the
band
played
on
and
the
crew
swam
ashore
and
two
of
the
laid
hold
of
the
boat
and
collected
the
oars
and
nobody
seemed
to
think
anything
of
it
katie
drew
a
long
breath
are
they
all
out
dear
she
said
can
you
see
i
can
only
count
eight
oh
i
was
too
frightened
to
look
let
me
see
yes
there
are
nine
there
one
by
himself
the
little
man
pulling
the
weeds
off
his
trousers
and
so
they
regained
their
equanimity
and
soon
after
left
the
barge
and
were
escorted
to
the
hall
of
ambrose
by
the
crew
who
gave
an
entertainment
there
to
celebrate
the
occasion
which
winter
was
induced
to
attend
and
pleased
to
approve
and
which
lasted
till
it
was
time
to
dress
for
the
ball
for
which
a
proper
chaperone
had
been
providentially
found
and
so
they
passed
the
days
and
nights
of
commemoration
but
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
work
to
chronicle
all
their
doings
how
notwithstanding
balls
at
night
they
were
up
to
chapel
in
the
morning
and
attended
at
worcester
and
musical
promenades
in
new
college
and
managed
to
get
down
the
river
for
a
picnic
at
nuneham
besides
seeing
everything
that
was
worth
seeing
in
all
the
colleges
how
it
was
done
no
man
can
tell
but
done
it
was
and
they
seemed
only
the
better
for
it
all
they
were
waiting
at
the
gates
of
the
theatre
amongst
the
first
tickets
in
hand
and
witnessed
the
whole
scene
wondering
no
little
at
the
strange
mixture
of
solemnity
and
license
the
rush
and
crowding
of
the
undergraduates
into
their
gallery
and
their
free
and
easy
way
of
taking
the
whole
proceedings
under
their
patronage
watching
every
movement
in
the
amphitheatre
and
on
the
floor
and
shouting
approval
and
disapproval
of
the
heads
of
their
republic
of
learning
or
of
the
most
illustrious
visitors
or
cheering
with
equal
vigor
the
ladies
her
ministers
or
the
prize
poems
it
is
a
strange
scene
certainly
and
has
probably
puzzled
many
persons
besides
young
ladies
one
can
well
fancy
the
astonishment
of
the
learned
foreigner
for
instance
when
he
sees
the
head
of
the
university
which
he
has
reverenced
at
a
distance
from
his
youth
up
rise
in
his
robes
in
solemn
convocation
to
exercise
one
of
the
highest
of
university
functions
and
hears
his
sonorous
latin
periods
interrupted
by
three
cheers
for
the
ladies
in
pink
bonnets
or
when
some
man
is
introduced
for
an
honorary
degree
whose
name
may
be
known
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
the
turning
to
his
compeers
inquires
placetne
vobis
domini
doctores
placetne
vobis
magistri
and
he
hears
the
voice
of
doctors
and
masters
drowned
in
contradictory
shouts
from
the
young
in
the
gallery
who
is
he
non
placet
why
does
he
carry
an
umbrella
it
is
thoroughly
english
and
that
is
just
all
that
need
or
indeed
can
be
said
for
it
all
but
not
one
in
a
hundred
of
us
would
alter
it
if
we
could
beyond
suppressing
some
of
the
personalities
which
of
late
years
have
gone
somewhat
too
far
after
the
theatre
there
was
sumptuous
lunch
in
all
souls
and
then
a
fete
in
john
gardens
now
at
the
aforesaid
luncheon
tom
feelings
had
been
severely
tried
in
fact
the
little
troubles
which
as
has
been
before
hinted
are
incident
to
persons
especially
young
men
in
his
fortunate
predicament
had
here
come
to
a
head
he
was
separated
from
his
cousin
a
little
way
being
a
guest
and
not
an
important
one
in
the
eyes
of
the
all
souls
fellows
he
had
to
find
his
level
which
was
very
much
below
that
allotted
to
his
uncle
and
cousins
in
short
he
felt
that
they
were
taking
him
about
instead
of
he
them
which
change
of
position
was
in
itself
trying
and
mary
conduct
fanned
his
slumbering
discontent
into
a
flame
there
she
was
sitting
between
a
fellow
of
all
souls
who
was
a
collector
of
pictures
and
an
authority
in
fine
art
matters
and
the
indian
officer
who
had
been
so
recently
promoted
to
the
degree
of
in
the
theatre
there
she
sat
so
absorbed
in
their
conversation
that
she
did
not
even
hear
a
remark
which
he
was
pleased
to
address
to
her
whereupon
he
began
to
brood
on
his
wrongs
and
to
take
umbrage
at
the
catholicity
of
her
enjoyment
and
enthusiasm
so
long
as
he
had
been
the
medium
through
which
she
was
brought
in
contact
with
others
he
had
been
well
enough
content
that
they
should
amuse
and
interest
her
but
it
was
a
very
different
thing
now
so
he
watched
her
jealously
and
raked
up
former
conversations
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
his
duty
to
remonstrate
with
her
he
had
remarked
too
that
she
never
could
talk
with
him
now
without
breaking
away
after
a
short
time
into
badinage
her
badinage
certainly
was
very
charming
and
pleasant
and
kept
him
on
the
stretch
but
why
should
she
not
let
him
be
serious
and
sentimental
when
he
pleased
she
did
not
break
out
in
this
manner
with
other
people
so
he
really
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
not
in
the
least
for
his
own
sake
but
for
hers
accordingly
when
the
party
broke
up
and
they
started
for
the
fete
at
john
he
resolved
to
carry
out
his
intentions
at
first
he
could
not
get
an
opportunity
while
they
were
walking
about
on
the
beautiful
lawn
of
the
great
garden
seeing
and
being
seen
and
listening
to
music
and
looking
at
choice
flowers
but
soon
a
chance
offered
she
stayed
behind
the
rest
without
noticing
it
to
examine
some
specially
beautiful
plant
and
he
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
and
proposed
to
show
her
the
smaller
garden
which
lies
beyond
to
which
she
innocently
consented
and
they
were
soon
out
of
the
crowd
and
in
comparative
solitude
she
remarked
that
he
was
somewhat
silent
and
grave
but
thought
nothing
of
it
and
chatted
on
as
usual
remarking
upon
the
pleasant
company
she
had
been
in
at
luncheon
this
opened
the
way
for
tom
lecture
how
easily
you
seem
to
get
interested
with
new
people
he
began
do
i
she
said
well
do
you
think
it
very
natural
would
it
be
a
blessing
if
people
would
always
say
just
what
they
think
and
mean
though
yes
and
a
great
many
do
she
replied
looking
at
him
in
some
wonder
and
not
quite
pleased
with
the
turn
things
were
taking
any
ladies
do
you
think
you
know
we
have
many
opportunities
of
observing
yes
i
think
quite
as
many
ladies
as
men
more
indeed
as
far
as
my
small
experience
goes
you
really
maintain
deliberately
that
you
have
met
people
men
and
women
who
can
talk
to
you
or
anyone
else
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
quite
honestly
and
say
nothing
at
all
which
they
mean
nothing
for
the
sake
of
flattery
or
effect
for
instance
oh
dear
me
yes
often
who
for
example
our
cousin
katie
why
are
you
so
suspicious
and
misanthropical
there
is
your
friend
hardy
again
what
do
you
say
to
him
well
i
think
you
may
have
hit
on
an
exception
but
i
maintain
the
rule
you
look
as
if
i
ought
to
object
but
i
it
is
no
business
of
mine
if
you
choose
to
believe
any
such
disagreeable
thing
about
your
i
do
believe
anything
worse
about
them
than
i
do
about
myself
i
know
that
i
ca
do
it
well
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
but
i
do
think
i
am
any
worse
than
my
neighbours
i
do
suppose
you
do
who
are
your
neighbors
shall
i
include
you
in
the
number
oh
by
all
means
if
you
like
but
i
may
not
mean
that
you
are
like
the
rest
the
man
who
fell
among
thieves
you
know
had
one
good
neighbor
now
cousin
tom
she
said
looking
up
with
sparkling
eyes
i
ca
return
the
compliment
you
meant
to
make
me
feel
that
i
like
the
rest
at
least
like
what
you
say
they
are
you
know
you
did
and
now
you
are
just
turning
round
and
trying
to
slip
out
of
it
by
saying
what
you
do
mean
well
cousin
mary
perhaps
i
was
at
any
rate
i
was
a
great
fool
for
my
pains
i
might
have
known
by
this
time
that
you
would
catch
me
out
fast
enough
perhaps
you
might
i
did
challenge
you
to
set
up
your
palace
of
truth
but
if
we
are
to
live
in
it
you
are
not
to
say
all
the
disagreeable
things
and
hear
none
of
them
i
hope
not
if
they
must
be
disagreeable
but
why
should
they
be
i
ca
see
why
you
and
i
for
instance
should
not
say
exactly
what
we
are
thinking
to
one
another
without
being
disagreeable
well
i
do
think
you
made
a
happy
beginning
just
now
but
i
am
sure
we
should
all
like
one
another
the
better
for
speaking
the
truth
yes
but
i
do
admit
that
i
have
been
speaking
the
truth
you
wo
understand
me
have
i
said
that
you
do
speak
the
truth
yes
you
said
just
now
that
i
do
say
what
i
think
and
mean
well
perhaps
you
did
exactly
say
that
but
that
is
what
you
meant
you
are
very
angry
cousin
mary
let
us
wait
till
no
no
it
was
you
who
began
and
i
will
not
let
you
off
now
very
well
then
i
did
mean
something
of
the
sort
it
is
better
to
tell
you
than
to
keep
it
to
myself
yes
and
now
tell
me
your
reasons
said
mary
looking
down
and
biting
her
lip
tom
was
ready
to
bite
his
tongue
off
but
there
was
nothing
now
but
to
go
through
with
it
you
make
everybody
that
comes
near
you
think
that
you
are
deeply
interested
in
them
and
their
doings
poor
grey
believes
that
you
are
as
mad
as
he
is
about
rituals
and
rubrics
and
the
boating
men
declare
that
you
would
sooner
see
a
race
than
go
to
the
best
ball
in
the
world
and
you
listened
to
the
dean
stale
old
stories
about
his
schools
and
went
into
raptures
in
the
bodleian
about
pictures
and
art
with
that
follow
of
all
souls
even
our
old
butler
and
the
cook
here
mary
despite
her
vexation
after
a
severe
struggle
to
control
it
burst
into
a
laugh
which
made
tom
pause
now
you
ca
say
that
i
am
not
really
fond
of
jellies
she
said
and
you
ca
say
that
i
have
said
anything
so
very
disagreeable
oh
but
you
have
though
at
any
rate
i
have
made
you
laugh
but
you
did
mean
to
do
it
now
go
on
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
you
see
my
meaning
or
you
never
will
if
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
you
should
not
have
said
so
much
said
mary
you
would
have
me
rude
to
all
the
people
i
meet
and
i
ca
help
it
if
the
cook
thinks
i
am
a
glutton
but
you
could
help
letting
grey
think
that
you
should
like
to
go
and
see
his
night
schools
but
i
should
like
to
see
them
of
all
things
and
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
go
through
the
manuscripts
in
the
bodleian
with
the
dean
i
heard
you
talking
to
him
as
if
it
was
the
dearest
wish
of
your
heart
and
making
a
half
engagement
to
go
with
him
this
afternoon
when
you
know
that
you
are
tired
to
death
of
him
and
so
full
of
other
engagements
that
you
know
where
to
turn
mary
began
to
bite
her
lips
again
she
felt
half
inclined
to
cry
and
half
inclined
to
get
up
and
box
his
ears
however
she
did
neither
but
looked
up
after
a
moment
or
two
and
said
well
have
you
any
more
unkind
words
to
say
unkind
mary
yes
they
unkind
how
can
i
enjoy
anything
now
when
i
shall
know
you
are
watching
me
and
thinking
all
sorts
of
harm
of
everything
i
say
and
do
however
it
does
much
matter
for
we
go
morning
but
you
will
give
me
credit
at
least
for
meaning
you
well
i
think
you
are
very
jealous
and
suspicious
you
do
know
how
you
pain
me
when
you
say
that
but
i
must
say
what
i
think
mary
set
her
little
mouth
and
looked
down
and
began
tapping
her
boot
with
her
parasol
there
was
an
awkward
silence
while
tom
considered
within
himself
whether
she
was
not
right
and
whether
after
all
his
own
jealousy
had
not
been
the
cause
of
the
lecture
he
had
been
delivering
much
more
than
any
unselfish
wish
for
mary
improvement
it
is
your
turn
now
he
said
presently
leaning
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
looking
hard
at
the
gravel
i
may
have
been
foolishly
jealous
and
i
thank
you
for
telling
me
so
but
you
can
tell
me
a
great
deal
more
if
you
will
quite
as
good
for
me
to
hear
no
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
daresay
you
are
open
and
true
and
have
nothing
to
hide
or
disguise
not
even
about
either
of
the
men
we
met
in
the
long
walk
on
sunday
he
winced
at
this
random
shaft
as
if
he
had
been
stung
and
she
saw
that
it
had
gone
home
and
repented
the
next
moment
the
silence
became
more
and
more
embarrassing
by
good
luck
however
their
party
suddenly
appeared
strolling
towards
them
from
the
large
garden
here
are
uncle
robert
and
katie
and
all
of
them
let
us
join
them
she
rose
up
and
he
with
her
and
as
they
walked
towards
the
rest
he
said
quickly
in
a
low
voice
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
have
pained
you
i
was
very
selfish
and
i
am
sorry
oh
yes
we
were
both
very
foolish
but
we
wo
do
it
again
here
you
are
at
last
we
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
said
miss
winter
as
they
came
up
i
sure
i
do
know
how
we
missed
you
we
came
straight
from
the
music
tent
to
this
seat
and
have
not
moved
we
knew
you
must
come
by
sooner
or
later
but
it
is
quite
out
of
the
way
it
is
quite
by
chance
that
we
came
round
here
is
uncle
robert
tired
katie
said
tom
he
does
look
well
this
afternoon
katie
instantly
turned
to
her
father
and
winter
declared
himself
to
be
much
fatigued
so
they
wished
their
hospitable
entertainers
and
tom
hurried
off
and
got
a
wheel
chair
for
his
uncle
and
walked
by
his
side
to
their
lodgings
the
young
ladies
walked
near
the
chair
also
accompanied
by
one
or
two
of
their
acquaintances
in
fact
they
could
not
move
without
an
escort
but
tom
never
once
turned
his
head
for
a
glance
at
what
was
going
on
and
talked
steadily
on
to
his
uncle
that
he
might
not
catch
a
stray
word
of
what
the
rest
were
saying
despite
of
all
this
however
he
was
quite
aware
somehow
when
he
made
his
bow
at
the
door
that
mary
had
been
very
silent
all
the
way
home
winter
retired
to
his
room
to
lie
down
and
his
daughter
and
niece
remained
in
the
mary
sat
down
and
untied
her
bonnet
but
did
not
burst
into
her
usual
flood
of
comments
on
the
events
of
the
day
miss
winter
looked
at
her
and
said
you
look
tired
dear
and
oh
yes
so
i
am
i
had
such
a
quarrel
with
tom
a
quarrel
you
not
serious
indeed
i
am
though
i
quite
hated
him
for
five
minutes
at
least
but
what
did
he
do
why
he
taunted
me
with
being
too
civil
to
everybody
and
it
made
me
so
angry
he
said
i
pretended
to
take
an
interest
in
ever
so
many
things
just
to
please
people
when
i
did
really
care
about
them
and
it
is
true
now
katie
is
it
no
dear
he
never
could
have
said
that
you
must
have
misunderstood
him
there
i
knew
you
would
say
so
and
if
it
were
true
i
sure
it
is
wrong
when
people
talk
to
you
it
so
easy
to
seem
pleased
and
interested
in
what
they
are
saying
and
then
they
like
you
and
it
is
so
pleasant
to
be
liked
now
katie
do
you
ever
snap
people
noses
off
or
tell
them
you
think
them
very
foolish
and
that
you
do
care
and
that
what
they
are
saying
is
all
of
no
consequence
i
dear
i
could
do
it
to
save
my
life
oh
i
was
sure
you
could
and
he
may
say
what
he
will
but
i
am
quite
sure
he
would
not
have
been
pleased
if
we
had
not
made
ourselves
pleasant
to
his
friends
that
quite
true
he
has
told
me
himself
half
a
dozen
times
how
delighted
he
was
to
see
you
so
popular
and
you
too
katie
oh
yes
he
was
very
well
pleased
with
me
but
it
is
you
who
have
turned
all
the
heads
in
the
college
mary
you
are
queen
of
ambrose
beyond
a
doubt
just
now
no
no
katie
not
more
than
you
at
any
rate
i
say
yes
yes
mary
you
will
always
be
ten
times
as
popular
as
i
some
people
have
the
gift
of
it
i
wish
i
had
but
why
do
you
look
so
grave
again
why
katie
do
you
see
you
are
just
saying
over
again
only
in
a
different
way
what
your
provoking
cousin
i
shall
call
him
brown
i
think
in
future
was
telling
me
for
my
good
in
john
gardens
you
saw
how
long
we
were
away
from
you
well
he
was
lecturing
me
all
the
time
only
think
and
now
you
are
going
to
tell
it
me
all
over
again
but
go
on
dear
i
mind
anything
from
you
she
put
her
arm
round
her
cousin
waist
and
looked
up
playfully
into
her
face
miss
winter
saw
at
once
that
no
great
harm
perhaps
some
good
had
been
done
in
the
passage
of
arms
between
her
relatives
you
made
it
all
up
she
said
smiling
before
we
found
you
only
just
though
he
begged
my
pardon
just
at
last
almost
in
a
whisper
when
you
were
quite
close
to
us
and
you
granted
it
yes
of
course
but
i
do
know
that
i
shall
not
recall
it
i
was
sure
you
would
be
falling
out
before
long
you
got
on
so
fast
but
he
is
quite
so
easy
to
turn
round
your
finger
as
you
thought
mary
oh
i
do
know
that
said
mary
laughing
you
saw
how
humble
he
looked
at
last
and
what
good
order
he
was
in
well
dear
it
time
to
think
whether
we
shall
go
out
again
let
me
see
there
the
last
ball
what
do
you
say
why
i
afraid
poor
papa
is
too
tired
to
take
us
and
i
know
with
whom
we
could
go
we
ought
to
begin
packing
too
i
think
very
well
let
us
have
tea
quietly
at
home
i
will
write
a
note
to
tom
to
tell
him
he
has
done
his
best
for
us
poor
fellow
and
we
ought
to
consider
him
a
little
oh
yes
and
ask
him
and
his
friend
hardy
to
tea
as
it
is
the
last
night
if
you
wish
it
i
shall
be
very
glad
they
will
amuse
papa
certainly
and
then
he
will
see
that
i
bear
him
no
malice
and
now
i
will
go
and
just
do
my
hair
very
well
and
we
will
pack
after
they
leave
how
strange
home
will
seem
after
all
this
gayety
yes
we
seem
to
have
been
here
a
month
i
do
hope
we
shall
find
all
quiet
at
englebourn
i
am
always
afraid
of
some
trouble
there
chapter
xxviii
the
end
of
the
freshman
year
on
the
morning
after
commemoration
oxford
was
in
a
bustle
of
departure
the
play
had
been
played
the
long
vacation
had
begun
and
visitors
and
members
seemed
equally
anxious
to
be
off
at
the
gates
of
the
colleges
groups
of
men
in
waited
for
the
coaches
omnibuses
and
all
manner
of
vehicles
which
were
to
carry
them
to
the
great
western
railway
station
at
steventon
or
elsewhere
to
all
points
of
the
compass
porters
passed
in
and
out
with
portmanteaus
and
baggage
of
all
kinds
which
they
piled
outside
the
gates
or
carried
off
to
the
mitre
or
the
angel
under
the
vigorous
and
not
too
courteous
orders
of
the
owners
college
servants
flitted
round
the
groups
to
take
instructions
and
if
so
might
be
to
extract
the
balances
of
extortionate
bills
out
of
their
departing
masters
were
there
also
holding
terriers
and
scouts
from
the
cricketing
grounds
with
bats
and
pads
under
their
arms
and
hostlers
and
men
from
the
boats
all
on
the
same
errand
of
getting
the
last
shilling
out
of
their
patrons
a
fawning
obsequious
crowd
for
the
most
part
with
here
and
there
a
sturdy
briton
who
felt
that
he
was
only
there
for
his
due
through
such
a
group
at
the
gate
of
ambrose
tom
and
hardy
passed
soon
after
breakfast
time
in
cap
and
gown
which
costume
excited
no
small
astonishment
hullo
brown
old
fellow
ai
you
off
this
morning
no
i
shall
be
up
for
a
day
or
two
yet
wish
you
joy
i
would
be
staying
up
over
for
something
but
you
be
at
henley
said
diogenes
confidently
who
stood
at
the
gate
in
boating
coat
and
flannels
a
big
stick
and
knapsack
waiting
for
a
companion
with
whom
he
was
going
to
walk
to
henley
and
at
lord
on
friday
said
another
it
will
be
a
famous
match
come
and
dine
somewhere
afterwards
and
go
to
the
haymarket
with
us
you
know
the
leander
are
to
be
at
henley
put
in
diogenes
and
cambridge
is
very
strong
there
will
be
a
splendid
race
for
the
cup
but
jervis
thinks
we
are
all
right
bother
your
eternal
races
have
we
had
enough
of
them
already
said
the
londoner
you
had
much
better
come
up
to
the
little
village
at
once
brown
and
stay
there
while
the
coin
lasts
if
i
get
away
at
all
it
will
be
to
henley
said
tom
of
course
i
knew
that
said
diogenes
triumphantly
our
boat
ought
to
be
on
for
the
ladies
plate
if
only
jervis
were
not
in
the
university
crew
i
thought
you
were
to
pull
at
henley
hardy
i
was
asked
to
pull
but
i
could
manage
the
time
with
the
schools
coming
on
and
when
the
examinations
were
over
it
was
too
late
the
crew
were
picked
and
half
trained
and
none
of
them
have
broken
down
what
every
one
of
them
stood
putting
through
the
sieve
they
must
be
a
rare
crew
then
said
another
you
right
said
diogenes
oh
here
you
are
at
last
he
added
as
another
man
in
flannels
and
knapsack
came
out
of
college
well
all
and
a
pleasant
vacation
we
must
be
off
if
we
are
to
be
in
time
to
see
our
crew
pull
over
the
course
and
the
two
marched
off
towards
magdalen
bridge
by
jove
remarked
a
fast
youth
in
most
elaborate
toilette
looking
after
them
fancy
two
fellows
grinding
off
to
henley
five
miles
an
hour
in
this
sun
when
they
might
drop
up
to
the
metropolis
by
train
in
half
the
time
is
it
marvellous
i
should
like
to
be
going
with
them
said
tom
well
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
here
our
coach
then
and
tom
shook
hands
and
leaving
the
coach
to
get
packed
with
portmanteaus
terriers
and
undergraduates
he
and
hardy
walked
off
towards
the
so
you
not
going
hardy
said
no
two
or
three
of
my
old
schoolfellows
are
coming
up
to
stand
for
scholarships
and
i
must
be
here
to
receive
them
but
very
unlucky
i
should
have
liked
so
to
have
been
at
henley
look
their
carriage
is
already
at
the
door
said
hardy
pointing
up
into
which
they
now
turned
there
were
a
dozen
postchaises
and
carriages
loading
in
front
of
different
houses
in
the
street
and
amongst
them
winter
travelling
barouche
so
it
is
said
tom
that
some
of
uncle
fidgetiness
but
he
will
be
sure
to
dawdle
at
the
last
come
along
in
do
you
think
i
had
better
stay
downstairs
it
may
seem
intrusive
no
come
along
why
they
asked
you
to
come
and
see
the
last
of
them
last
night
did
they
hardy
did
not
require
any
further
urging
to
induce
him
to
follow
his
inclination
so
the
two
went
up
together
the
breakfast
things
were
still
on
the
table
at
which
sat
miss
winter
in
her
bonnet
employed
in
examining
the
bill
with
the
assistance
of
mary
who
leant
over
her
shoulder
she
looked
up
as
they
entered
oh
i
so
glad
you
are
come
poor
katie
is
so
bothered
and
i
ca
help
her
do
look
at
the
bill
is
it
all
right
shall
i
katie
yes
please
do
i
do
see
anything
to
object
to
except
perhaps
the
things
i
have
marked
do
you
think
we
ought
to
be
charged
half
a
crown
a
day
for
the
kitchen
fire
fire
in
june
and
you
have
never
dined
at
home
once
no
but
we
have
had
tea
several
times
it
is
a
regular
swindle
said
tom
taking
the
bill
and
glancing
at
it
here
hardy
come
and
help
me
cut
down
this
precious
total
they
sat
down
to
the
bill
the
ladies
willingly
giving
place
mary
tripped
off
to
the
glass
to
tie
her
bonnet
now
that
is
all
right
she
said
merrily
why
ca
one
go
on
without
bills
or
horrid
money
ah
why
ca
one
said
tom
that
would
suit
most
of
our
complaints
but
where
uncle
has
he
seen
the
bill
no
papa
is
in
his
room
he
must
not
be
worried
or
the
journey
will
be
too
much
for
him
here
the
arrived
with
a
message
that
her
father
wished
to
see
miss
winter
leave
your
money
katie
said
her
cousin
this
is
business
and
tom
and
hardy
will
settle
it
all
for
us
i
am
sure
tom
professed
his
entire
willingness
to
accept
the
charge
delighted
at
finding
himself
reinstated
in
his
office
of
protector
at
mary
suggestion
had
the
landlord
been
one
or
his
own
tradesmen
or
the
bill
his
own
bill
he
might
not
have
been
so
well
pleased
but
as
neither
of
these
was
the
case
and
he
had
hardy
to
back
him
he
went
into
the
matter
with
much
vigor
and
discretion
and
had
the
landlord
up
made
the
proper
deductions
and
got
the
bill
settled
and
receipted
in
a
few
minutes
then
he
and
hardy
addressed
themselves
to
getting
the
carriage
comfortably
packed
and
vied
with
one
another
in
settling
and
stowing
away
in
the
most
convenient
places
the
many
little
odds
and
ends
which
naturally
accompany
young
ladies
and
invalids
on
their
travels
in
the
course
of
which
employment
he
managed
to
snatch
a
few
words
here
and
there
with
mary
and
satisfied
himself
that
she
bore
him
no
for
the
events
of
the
previous
day
at
last
all
was
ready
for
the
start
and
tom
reported
the
fact
in
the
then
i
will
go
and
fetch
papa
said
miss
winter
tom
eyes
met
mary
at
the
moment
he
gave
a
slight
shrug
with
his
shoulders
and
said
as
the
door
closed
after
his
cousin
really
i
have
no
patience
with
uncle
robert
he
leaves
poor
katie
to
do
everything
yes
and
how
beautifully
she
does
it
all
without
a
word
or
i
believe
a
thought
of
complaint
i
could
never
be
so
patient
i
think
it
is
a
pity
if
uncle
robert
were
obliged
to
exert
himself
it
would
be
much
better
for
him
katie
is
only
spoiling
him
and
wearing
herself
out
yes
it
is
very
easy
for
you
and
me
to
think
and
say
so
but
he
is
her
father
and
then
he
is
really
an
invalid
so
she
goes
on
devoting
herself
to
him
more
and
more
and
feels
she
can
never
do
too
much
for
him
but
if
she
believed
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
exert
himself
i
sure
it
is
the
truth
could
you
try
to
persuade
her
no
indeed
it
would
only
worry
her
and
be
so
cruel
but
then
i
am
not
used
to
give
advice
she
added
after
a
moment
pause
looking
demurely
at
her
gloves
it
might
do
good
perhaps
now
if
you
were
to
speak
to
her
you
think
me
so
well
qualified
i
suppose
after
the
specimen
you
had
yesterday
thank
you
i
have
had
enough
of
lecturing
for
the
present
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
really
for
what
you
said
to
me
said
mary
still
looking
at
her
gloves
the
subject
was
a
very
distasteful
one
to
tom
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
to
see
whether
she
was
laughing
at
him
and
then
broke
it
off
abruptly
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
your
visit
oh
yes
so
very
much
i
shall
think
of
it
all
the
summer
where
shall
you
be
all
the
summer
asked
tom
not
so
very
far
from
you
papa
has
taken
a
house
only
eight
miles
from
englebourn
and
katie
says
you
live
within
a
day
drive
of
them
and
shall
you
be
there
all
the
vacation
yes
and
we
hope
to
get
katie
over
often
could
not
you
come
and
meet
her
it
would
be
so
pleasant
but
do
you
think
i
might
i
do
know
your
father
or
mother
oh
yes
papa
and
mamma
are
very
kind
and
will
ask
anybody
i
like
besides
you
are
a
cousin
you
know
only
up
at
oxford
i
am
afraid
well
now
you
will
see
we
are
going
to
have
a
great
archery
party
next
month
and
you
shall
have
an
invitation
will
you
write
it
for
me
yourself
very
likely
but
why
do
you
think
i
shall
value
a
note
in
your
hand
more
than
nonsense
now
remember
your
lecture
oh
here
are
uncle
robert
and
katie
winter
was
very
gracious
and
thanked
tom
for
all
his
attentions
he
had
been
very
pleased
he
said
to
make
his
nephew
acquaintance
again
so
pleasantly
and
hoped
he
would
come
and
pass
a
day
or
two
at
englebourn
in
the
vacation
in
his
sad
state
of
health
he
could
not
do
much
to
entertain
a
young
man
but
he
could
procure
him
some
good
fishing
and
shooting
in
the
neighborhood
tom
assured
his
uncle
that
nothing
would
please
him
so
much
as
a
visit
to
englebourn
perhaps
the
remembrance
of
the
distance
between
that
parish
and
the
place
where
mary
was
to
spend
the
summer
may
have
added
a
little
to
his
enthusiasm
i
should
have
liked
also
to
have
thanked
your
friend
for
his
hospitality
winter
went
on
i
understood
my
daughter
to
say
he
was
here
yes
he
was
here
just
now
said
tom
he
must
be
below
i
think
what
that
good
mr
hardy
said
mary
who
was
looking
out
of
the
window
there
he
is
in
the
street
he
has
just
helped
hopkins
into
the
rumble
and
handed
her
things
to
her
just
as
if
she
were
a
duchess
she
has
been
so
cross
all
the
morning
and
now
she
looks
quite
gracious
then
i
think
papa
we
had
better
start
let
me
give
you
an
arm
down
stairs
uncle
said
tom
and
so
he
helped
his
uncle
down
to
the
carriage
the
two
young
ladies
following
behind
and
the
landlord
standing
with
obsequious
bows
at
his
shop
door
and
looking
as
if
he
had
never
made
an
overcharge
in
his
life
while
winter
was
making
his
acknowledgments
to
hardy
and
being
helped
by
him
into
the
most
comfortable
seat
in
the
carriage
tom
was
making
tender
adieus
to
the
two
young
ladies
behind
and
even
succeeded
in
keeping
a
which
mary
was
carrying
when
they
took
their
seats
she
parted
from
it
and
the
cracked
his
whip
and
the
barouche
went
lumbering
along
hardy
and
tom
watched
it
until
it
turned
down
aldate
towards
folly
bridge
the
latter
waving
his
hand
as
it
disappeared
and
then
they
turned
and
strolled
slowly
away
side
by
side
in
silence
the
sight
of
all
the
other
departures
increased
the
uncomfortable
unsatisfied
feeling
which
that
of
his
own
relatives
had
already
produced
in
tom
mind
well
it
is
lively
stopping
up
here
when
everybody
is
going
is
it
what
is
one
to
do
ought
you
to
be
looking
after
your
friends
who
are
coming
up
to
try
for
the
scholarships
no
they
wo
be
up
till
afternoon
by
coach
shall
we
go
down
to
the
river
then
no
it
would
be
miserable
hullo
look
here
what
up
the
cause
of
tom
astonishment
was
the
appearance
of
the
usual
procession
of
university
beadles
carrying
maces
and
escorting
the
towards
mary
why
the
bells
are
going
for
service
there
must
be
a
university
sermon
is
it
a
saint
day
where
the
congregation
to
come
from
why
half
oxford
is
off
by
this
time
and
those
that
are
left
wo
want
to
be
hearing
sermons
well
i
do
know
a
good
many
seem
to
be
going
i
wonder
who
is
to
preach
i
vote
we
go
it
will
help
to
pass
the
time
hardy
agreed
and
they
followed
the
procession
and
went
up
into
the
gallery
of
mary
there
was
a
very
fair
congregation
in
the
body
of
the
church
and
the
staffs
of
the
colleges
had
not
yet
broken
up
and
even
in
the
gallery
the
undergraduates
mustered
in
some
force
the
restless
feeling
which
had
brought
our
hero
there
seemed
to
have
had
a
like
effect
on
most
of
the
men
who
were
for
one
reason
or
another
unable
to
start
on
that
day
tom
looked
steadily
into
his
cap
during
the
bidding
prayer
and
sat
down
composedly
afterwards
expecting
not
to
be
much
interested
or
benefitted
but
comforted
with
the
assurance
that
at
any
rate
it
would
be
almost
luncheon
time
before
he
would
be
again
thrown
on
his
own
resources
but
he
was
mistaken
in
his
expectations
and
before
the
preacher
had
been
speaking
for
three
minutes
was
all
attention
the
sermon
was
upon
the
freedom
of
the
gospel
the
power
by
which
it
bursts
all
bonds
and
lets
the
oppressed
go
free
its
burthen
was
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
the
preacher
dwelt
on
many
sides
of
these
words
the
freedom
of
nations
of
societies
of
universities
of
the
conscience
of
each
individual
man
were
each
glanced
at
in
turn
and
then
reminding
his
hearers
of
the
end
of
the
academical
year
he
went
on
we
have
heard
it
said
in
the
troubles
and
toils
and
temptations
of
the
world
that
i
could
begin
life
over
again
oh
that
i
could
fall
asleep
and
wake
up
twelve
six
three
mouths
hence
and
find
my
difficulties
solved
that
which
we
may
vainly
wish
elsewhere
by
a
happy
providence
is
furnished
to
us
by
the
natural
divisions
of
meeting
and
parting
in
this
place
to
everyone
of
us
old
and
young
the
long
vacation
on
which
we
are
now
entering
gives
us
a
breathing
space
and
time
to
break
the
bonds
which
place
and
circumstance
have
woven
round
us
during
the
year
that
is
past
from
all
our
petty
cares
and
confusions
and
intrigues
from
the
dust
and
clatter
of
this
huge
machinery
amidst
which
we
labor
and
toil
from
whatever
cynical
contempt
of
what
is
generous
and
devout
from
whatever
fanciful
disregard
of
what
is
just
and
wise
from
whatever
gall
of
bitterness
is
secreted
in
our
best
motives
from
whatever
bonds
of
unequal
dealings
in
which
we
may
have
entangled
ourselves
or
others
we
are
now
for
a
time
set
free
we
stand
on
the
edge
of
a
river
which
shall
for
a
time
at
least
sweep
them
away
that
ancient
river
the
kishon
the
river
of
fresh
thoughts
and
fresh
scenes
and
fresh
feelings
and
fresh
hopes
one
surely
amongst
the
blessed
means
whereby
god
free
and
loving
grace
works
out
our
deliverance
our
redemption
from
evil
and
renews
the
strength
of
each
succeeding
year
so
that
we
may
up
again
as
eagles
may
run
and
not
be
weary
may
walk
and
not
faint
and
if
turning
to
the
younger
part
of
my
hearers
i
may
still
more
directly
apply
this
general
lesson
to
them
is
there
no
one
who
in
some
shape
or
other
does
not
feel
the
bondage
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
he
has
something
on
his
conscience
he
has
something
on
his
mind
extravagance
sin
debt
falsehood
every
morning
in
the
first
few
minutes
after
waking
it
is
the
first
thought
that
occurs
to
him
he
drives
it
away
in
the
day
he
drives
it
off
by
recklessness
which
only
binds
it
more
and
more
closely
round
him
is
there
any
one
who
has
ever
felt
who
is
at
this
moment
feeling
this
grievous
burden
what
is
the
deliverance
how
shall
he
set
himself
free
in
what
special
way
does
the
redemption
of
christ
the
free
grace
of
god
present
itself
to
him
there
is
at
least
one
way
clear
and
simple
he
knows
it
better
than
anyone
can
tell
him
it
is
those
same
words
which
i
used
with
another
purpose
truth
shall
make
him
free
it
is
to
tell
the
truth
to
his
friend
to
his
parent
to
any
one
whosoever
it
be
from
whom
he
is
concealing
that
which
he
ought
to
make
known
one
word
of
open
frank
disclosure
one
resolution
to
act
sincerely
and
honestly
by
himself
and
others
one
ray
of
truth
let
into
that
dark
corner
will
indeed
set
the
whole
man
free
animam
have
delivered
my
soul
what
a
faithful
expression
is
this
of
the
relief
the
deliverance
effected
by
one
strong
effort
of
will
in
one
moment
of
time
will
arise
and
go
to
my
father
and
will
say
unto
him
father
i
have
sinned
against
heaven
and
before
thee
and
am
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
son
so
we
heard
the
prodigal
confession
this
morning
so
may
the
thought
well
spring
up
in
the
minds
of
any
who
in
the
course
of
this
last
year
have
wandered
into
sin
have
found
themselves
beset
with
evil
habits
of
wicked
idleness
of
wretched
now
that
you
are
indeed
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
about
to
rise
and
go
to
your
father
now
that
you
will
be
able
to
shake
off
the
bondage
of
bad
companionship
now
that
the
whole
length
of
this
long
absence
will
roll
between
you
and
the
past
take
a
long
breath
break
off
the
yoke
of
your
sin
of
your
fault
of
your
wrong
doing
of
your
folly
of
your
perverseness
of
your
pride
of
your
vanity
of
your
weakness
break
it
off
by
truth
break
it
off
by
one
stout
effort
in
one
steadfast
prayer
break
it
off
by
innocent
and
free
enjoyment
break
it
off
by
honest
work
put
your
to
the
nail
and
your
right
hand
to
the
workman
hammer
strike
through
the
enemy
which
has
ensnared
you
pierce
and
strike
him
through
and
through
however
powerful
he
seems
at
your
feet
he
will
bow
he
will
fall
he
will
lie
down
at
your
feet
he
will
bow
and
fall
and
where
he
bows
there
will
he
rise
up
no
more
so
let
all
thine
enemies
perish
o
lord
but
let
them
that
love
thee
be
as
the
sun
when
he
goeth
forth
in
his
might
this
quotation
is
from
the
sermon
preached
by
stanley
before
the
university
on
act
sunday
published
by
parker
of
oxford
i
hope
the
distinguished
professor
whose
words
they
are
will
pardon
the
liberty
i
have
taken
in
quoting
them
no
words
of
my
own
could
have
given
so
vividly
what
i
wanted
to
say
the
two
friends
separated
themselves
from
the
crowd
in
the
porch
and
walked
away
side
by
side
towards
their
college
well
that
was
a
bad
move
of
ours
it
is
worth
something
to
hear
a
man
preach
that
sort
of
doctrine
said
hardy
how
does
he
get
to
know
it
all
said
tom
meditatively
all
what
i
do
see
your
puzzle
why
all
sorts
of
things
that
are
in
a
fellow
mind
what
he
thinks
about
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
for
instance
pretty
much
like
the
rest
of
us
i
take
it
by
looking
at
home
you
do
suppose
university
preachers
are
unlike
you
and
me
well
i
do
know
now
do
you
think
he
ever
had
anything
on
his
mind
that
was
always
coming
up
and
plaguing
him
and
which
he
never
told
to
anybody
yes
i
should
think
so
most
of
us
must
have
had
have
you
ay
often
and
often
and
you
think
his
remedy
the
right
one
the
only
one
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
the
sting
is
gone
there
a
great
deal
to
be
done
afterwards
of
course
but
there
can
be
no
question
about
step
no
did
you
ever
owe
a
hundred
pounds
that
you
could
pay
said
tom
with
a
sudden
effort
and
his
secret
had
hardly
passed
his
lips
before
he
felt
a
relief
which
surprised
himself
my
dear
fellow
said
hardy
stopping
in
the
street
you
mean
to
say
you
are
speaking
of
yourself
i
do
though
said
tom
and
it
has
been
on
my
mind
ever
since
easter
term
and
has
spoilt
my
temper
and
everything
that
and
something
else
that
you
know
of
you
must
have
seen
me
getting
more
and
more
i
sure
and
i
have
thought
of
it
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
the
last
thing
at
night
and
tried
to
drive
the
thought
away
just
as
he
said
one
did
in
his
sermon
by
jove
i
thought
he
knew
all
about
it
for
he
looked
right
at
me
just
when
he
came
to
that
place
but
brown
how
do
you
mean
you
owe
a
hundred
pounds
you
have
read
much
certainly
but
you
have
hunted
or
gambled
or
tailored
much
or
gone
into
any
other
extravagant
folly
you
must
be
dreaming
am
i
though
come
up
to
my
rooms
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
feel
better
already
now
i
let
it
out
i
send
over
for
your
commons
and
we
have
some
lunch
hardy
followed
his
friend
in
much
trouble
of
mind
considering
in
himself
whether
with
the
remainder
of
his
savings
he
could
not
make
up
the
sum
which
tom
had
named
fortunately
for
both
of
them
a
short
calculation
showed
him
that
he
could
not
and
he
gave
up
the
idea
of
delivering
his
friend
in
this
summary
manner
with
a
sigh
he
remained
closeted
with
tom
for
an
hour
and
then
came
out
looking
serious
still
but
not
uncomfortable
and
went
down
to
the
river
he
sculled
down
to
sandford
bathed
in
the
lasher
and
returned
in
time
for
chapel
he
stayed
outside
afterwards
and
tom
came
up
to
him
and
seized
his
arm
i
done
it
old
fellow
he
said
look
here
and
produced
a
letter
hardy
glanced
at
the
direction
and
saw
that
it
was
to
his
father
come
along
and
post
it
said
tom
and
then
i
shall
feel
all
right
they
walked
off
quickly
to
the
and
dropped
the
letter
into
the
box
there
he
said
as
it
disappeared
animam
i
owe
the
preacher
a
good
turn
for
that
i
a
good
mind
to
write
and
thank
him
fancy
the
poor
old
governor
face
at
breakfast
well
you
seem
to
take
it
easy
enough
now
said
hardy
i
ca
help
it
i
tell
you
i
have
felt
so
jolly
this
two
months
what
a
fool
i
was
not
to
have
done
it
before
after
all
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
can
pay
it
myself
at
least
as
soon
as
i
am
of
age
for
i
know
i
some
money
a
legacy
or
something
coming
to
me
then
but
that
is
what
i
care
about
now
i
very
glad
though
that
you
have
the
money
of
your
own
yes
but
the
having
told
it
is
all
the
comfort
come
along
and
let
see
whether
these
boys
are
come
the
old
pig
ought
to
be
in
by
this
time
and
i
want
them
to
dine
in
hall
it
only
ten
months
since
i
came
up
on
it
to
matriculate
and
it
seems
twenty
years
but
i
going
to
be
a
boy
again
for
you
see
if
i
not
chapter
xxix
the
long
vacation
june
my
dear
tom
your
letter
came
to
hand
this
morning
and
it
has
of
course
given
your
mother
and
me
much
pain
it
is
not
the
money
that
we
care
about
but
that
our
son
should
have
deliberately
undertaken
or
pretended
to
undertake
what
he
must
have
known
at
the
time
he
could
not
perform
himself
i
have
written
to
my
bankers
to
pay
at
once
to
your
account
at
the
oxford
bank
i
have
also
requested
my
solicitor
to
go
over
to
oxford
and
he
will
probably
call
on
you
the
day
after
you
receive
this
you
say
that
this
person
who
holds
your
note
of
hand
is
now
in
oxford
you
will
see
him
in
the
presence
of
my
solicitor
to
whom
you
will
hand
the
note
when
you
have
recovered
it
i
shall
consider
afterwards
what
further
steps
will
have
to
be
taken
in
the
matter
you
will
not
be
of
age
for
a
year
it
will
be
time
enough
then
to
determine
whether
you
will
repay
the
balance
of
this
money
out
of
the
legacy
to
which
you
will
be
entitled
under
your
grandfather
will
in
the
meantime
i
shall
deduct
at
the
rate
of
a
year
from
your
allowance
and
i
shall
hold
your
bond
in
honor
to
reduce
your
expenditure
by
this
amount
you
are
no
longer
a
boy
and
one
of
the
first
duties
which
a
man
owes
to
his
friends
and
to
society
is
to
live
within
his
income
i
make
this
advance
to
you
on
two
conditions
first
that
you
will
never
again
put
your
hand
to
a
note
or
bill
in
a
transaction
of
this
kind
if
you
have
money
lend
it
or
spend
it
you
may
lend
or
spend
foolishly
but
that
is
not
the
point
here
at
any
rate
you
are
dealing
with
what
is
your
own
but
in
transactions
of
this
kind
you
are
dealing
with
what
is
not
your
own
a
gentleman
should
shrink
from
the
possibility
of
having
to
come
on
others
even
on
his
own
father
for
the
fulfillment
of
his
obligations
as
he
would
from
a
lie
i
would
sooner
see
a
son
of
mine
in
his
grave
than
crawling
on
through
life
a
slave
to
wants
and
habits
which
he
must
gratify
at
other
people
expense
my
second
condition
is
that
you
put
an
end
to
your
acquaintance
with
these
two
gentlemen
who
have
led
you
into
this
scrape
and
have
divided
the
proceeds
of
your
joint
note
between
them
they
are
both
your
seniors
in
standing
you
say
and
they
appear
to
be
familiar
with
this
plan
of
raising
money
at
the
expense
of
other
people
the
plain
english
word
for
such
doings
is
swindling
what
pains
me
most
is
that
you
have
become
intimate
with
young
men
of
this
kind
i
am
not
sure
that
it
will
not
be
my
duty
to
lay
the
whole
matter
before
the
authorities
of
the
college
you
do
not
mention
their
names
and
i
respect
the
feeling
which
has
led
you
not
to
mention
them
i
shall
know
them
quite
soon
enough
through
my
solicitor
who
will
forward
me
a
copy
of
the
note
of
hand
and
signatures
in
due
course
your
letter
makes
general
allusion
to
other
matters
and
i
gather
from
it
that
you
are
dissatisfied
with
the
manner
in
which
you
have
spent
your
first
year
at
oxford
i
do
not
ask
for
specific
confessions
which
you
seem
inclined
to
offer
me
in
fact
i
would
sooner
not
have
them
unless
there
is
any
other
matter
in
which
you
want
assistance
or
advice
from
me
i
know
from
experience
that
oxford
is
a
place
full
of
temptation
of
all
kinds
offered
to
young
men
at
the
most
critical
time
of
their
lives
knowing
this
i
have
deliberately
accepted
the
responsibility
of
sending
you
there
and
i
do
not
repent
it
i
am
glad
that
you
are
dissatisfied
with
your
first
year
if
you
had
not
been
i
should
have
felt
much
more
anxious
about
your
second
let
bygones
be
bygones
between
you
and
me
you
know
where
to
go
for
strength
and
to
make
confessions
which
no
human
ear
should
hear
for
no
human
judgment
can
weigh
the
cause
the
secret
places
of
a
man
heart
are
for
himself
and
god
your
mother
sends
her
love
i
am
ever
your
affectionate
father
john
brown
june
my
dear
boy
i
am
not
sorry
that
you
have
taken
my
last
letter
as
you
have
done
it
is
quite
right
to
be
sensitive
on
these
points
and
it
will
have
done
you
no
harm
to
have
fancied
for
hours
that
you
had
in
my
judgment
lost
caste
as
a
gentleman
but
now
i
am
very
glad
to
be
able
to
ease
your
mind
on
this
point
you
have
done
a
very
foolish
thing
but
it
is
only
the
habit
and
the
getting
others
to
bind
themselves
and
not
the
doing
it
oneself
for
others
which
is
disgraceful
you
are
going
to
pay
honourably
for
your
folly
and
will
owe
me
neither
thanks
nor
money
in
the
transaction
i
have
chosen
my
own
terms
for
repayment
which
you
have
accepted
and
so
the
financial
question
is
disposed
of
i
have
considered
what
you
say
as
to
your
companions
friends
i
will
not
call
them
and
will
promise
you
not
to
take
any
further
steps
or
to
mention
the
subject
to
anyone
but
i
must
insist
on
my
second
condition
that
you
avoid
all
further
intimacy
with
them
i
do
not
mean
that
you
are
to
cut
them
or
do
anything
that
will
attract
attention
but
no
more
intimacy
and
now
my
dear
boy
as
to
the
rest
of
your
letter
mine
must
indeed
have
failed
to
express
my
meaning
god
forbid
that
there
should
not
be
the
most
perfect
confidence
between
us
there
is
nothing
which
i
desire
or
value
more
i
only
question
whether
special
confessions
will
conduce
to
it
my
experience
is
against
them
i
almost
doubt
whether
they
can
be
perfectly
honest
between
man
and
man
and
taking
into
account
the
difference
of
our
ages
it
seems
to
be
much
more
likely
that
we
should
misunderstand
one
another
but
having
said
this
i
leave
it
to
you
to
follow
your
own
conscience
in
the
matter
if
there
is
any
burthen
which
i
can
help
you
to
bear
it
will
be
my
greatest
pleasure
as
it
is
my
duty
to
do
it
so
now
say
what
you
please
or
say
no
more
if
you
speak
it
will
be
to
one
who
has
felt
and
remembers
a
young
man
trials
we
hope
you
will
be
able
to
come
home
or
the
next
day
at
latest
your
mother
is
longing
to
see
you
and
i
should
be
glad
to
have
you
here
a
day
or
two
before
the
assizes
which
are
held
next
week
i
should
rather
like
you
to
accompany
me
to
them
as
it
will
give
me
the
opportunity
of
introducing
you
to
my
brother
magistrates
from
other
parts
of
the
county
whom
you
are
not
likely
to
meet
elsewhere
and
it
is
a
good
thing
for
a
young
man
to
know
his
own
county
well
the
cricket
club
is
very
flourishing
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
and
they
have
put
off
their
best
matches
till
your
return
so
you
are
in
great
request
you
see
i
am
told
that
the
fishing
is
very
good
this
year
and
am
promised
several
days
for
you
in
the
club
water
september
is
a
long
way
off
but
there
is
nothing
like
being
before
hand
i
have
put
your
name
down
for
a
license
and
it
is
time
you
should
have
a
good
gun
of
your
own
so
i
have
ordered
one
for
you
from
a
man
who
has
lately
settled
in
the
county
he
was
purdy
foreman
with
whom
i
used
to
build
and
i
can
see
understands
his
business
thoroughly
his
locks
are
as
good
as
any
i
have
ever
seen
i
have
told
him
to
make
the
stock
rather
longer
and
not
quite
so
straight
as
that
of
my
old
double
with
which
you
shot
last
year
i
think
i
remember
you
criticized
my
weapon
on
these
points
but
there
will
be
time
for
you
to
alter
the
details
after
you
get
home
if
you
disapprove
of
my
orders
it
will
be
more
satisfactory
if
it
is
built
under
your
own
eye
if
you
continue
in
the
mind
for
a
month
reading
with
your
friend
hardy
we
will
arrange
it
towards
the
end
of
the
vacation
but
would
he
not
come
here
from
what
you
say
we
should
very
much
like
to
know
him
pray
ask
him
from
me
whether
he
will
pass
the
last
month
of
the
vacation
here
reading
with
you
i
should
like
you
to
be
his
first
regular
pupil
of
course
this
will
be
my
affair
and
now
god
bless
you
and
come
home
as
soon
as
you
can
your
mother
sends
her
best
love
ever
your
most
affectionate
john
brown
englebourn
rectory
june
dearest
mary
how
good
of
you
to
write
to
me
so
soon
your
letter
has
come
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
i
am
in
the
midst
of
worries
already
indeed
as
you
know
i
could
never
quite
throw
off
the
fear
of
what
might
be
happening
here
while
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
at
oxford
and
it
has
all
turned
out
even
worse
than
i
expected
i
shall
never
be
able
to
go
away
again
in
comfort
i
think
and
yet
if
i
had
been
here
i
do
know
that
i
could
have
done
any
good
it
is
so
very
sad
that
poor
papa
is
unable
to
attend
to
his
magistrate
business
and
he
has
been
worse
than
usual
quite
laid
up
in
fact
since
our
return
there
is
no
other
magistrate
not
even
a
gentleman
in
the
place
as
you
know
except
the
curate
and
they
will
not
listen
to
him
even
if
he
would
interfere
in
their
quarrels
but
he
says
he
will
not
meddle
with
secular
matters
and
poor
man
i
can
not
blame
him
for
it
is
very
easy
and
sad
and
wearing
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
all
but
now
i
must
tell
you
all
my
troubles
you
remember
the
men
whom
we
saw
mowing
together
just
before
we
went
to
oxford
betty
winburn
son
was
one
of
them
and
i
am
afraid
the
rest
are
not
at
all
good
company
for
him
when
they
had
finished
papa
hay
they
went
to
mow
for
farmer
tester
you
must
remember
him
dear
i
am
sure
the
tall
gaunt
man
with
heavy
thick
lips
and
a
broken
nose
and
the
top
of
his
head
quite
flat
as
if
it
had
been
cut
off
a
little
above
his
eyebrows
he
is
a
very
miserly
man
and
a
hard
master
at
least
all
the
poor
people
tell
me
so
and
he
looks
cruel
i
have
always
been
afraid
of
him
and
disliked
him
for
i
remember
as
a
child
hearing
papa
complain
how
troublesome
he
was
in
the
vestry
and
except
old
simon
who
i
believe
only
does
it
from
perverseness
i
have
never
heard
anybody
speak
well
of
him
the
first
day
that
the
men
went
to
mow
for
farmer
tester
he
gave
them
sour
beer
to
drink
you
see
dear
they
bargained
to
mow
for
so
much
money
and
their
beer
they
were
very
discontented
at
this
and
they
lost
a
good
deal
of
time
going
to
complain
to
him
about
it
and
they
had
high
words
with
him
the
men
said
the
beer
was
fit
for
pigs
and
the
farmer
said
it
was
quite
good
enough
such
as
they
and
if
they
like
his
beer
they
might
buy
their
own
in
the
evening
too
he
came
down
and
complained
that
the
mowing
was
bad
and
then
there
were
more
high
words
for
the
men
are
very
jealous
about
their
work
however
they
went
to
work
as
usual
the
next
morning
and
all
might
have
gone
off
quietly
but
in
the
day
farmer
tester
found
two
pigs
in
his
turnip
field
which
adjoins
the
common
and
had
them
put
in
the
pound
one
of
these
pigs
belonged
to
betty
winburn
son
and
the
other
to
one
of
the
men
who
was
mowing
with
him
so
when
they
came
home
at
night
they
found
what
had
happened
the
constable
is
our
the
little
man
who
amused
you
so
much
he
plays
the
in
church
when
he
puts
any
beasts
into
the
pound
he
cuts
a
stick
in
two
and
gives
one
piece
to
the
person
who
brings
the
beasts
and
keeps
the
other
himself
and
the
owner
of
the
beasts
has
to
bring
the
other
end
of
the
stick
to
him
before
he
can
let
them
out
therefore
the
owner
you
see
must
go
to
the
person
who
has
pounded
his
beasts
and
make
a
bargain
with
him
for
payment
of
the
damage
which
has
been
done
and
so
get
back
the
other
end
of
the
stick
which
they
call
the
to
produce
to
the
well
the
men
went
off
to
the
constable
when
they
heard
their
pigs
were
pounded
to
find
who
had
the
and
when
they
found
it
was
farmer
tester
they
went
in
a
body
to
his
house
to
remonstrate
with
him
and
learn
what
he
set
the
damages
at
the
farmer
used
dreadful
language
to
them
i
hear
and
said
they
were
fit
to
have
pigs
and
must
pay
half
a
crown
for
each
pig
before
they
could
have
the
and
the
men
irritated
him
by
telling
him
that
his
fences
were
a
shame
to
the
parish
because
he
was
too
stingy
to
have
them
mended
and
that
the
pigs
have
found
half
a
crown
worth
of
turnips
in
the
whole
field
for
he
never
put
any
manure
on
it
except
what
he
could
get
off
the
road
which
ought
to
belong
to
the
poor
at
last
the
farmer
drove
them
away
saying
he
should
stop
the
money
out
of
the
price
he
was
to
pay
for
their
mowing
then
there
was
very
near
being
a
riot
in
the
parish
for
some
of
the
men
are
very
reckless
people
and
they
went
in
the
evening
and
blew
horns
and
beat
kettles
before
his
house
till
the
constable
who
has
behaved
very
well
persuaded
them
to
go
away
in
the
morning
one
of
the
pigs
had
been
taken
out
of
the
pound
not
betty
son
i
am
glad
to
say
for
no
doubt
it
was
very
wrong
of
the
men
to
take
it
out
the
farmer
was
furious
and
went
with
the
constable
in
the
morning
to
find
the
pig
but
they
could
hear
nothing
of
it
anywhere
james
pope
the
man
to
whom
it
belonged
only
laughed
at
them
and
said
he
never
could
keep
his
pig
in
himself
because
it
was
grandson
to
one
of
the
acting
pigs
that
went
about
to
the
fairs
and
all
the
pigs
of
that
family
took
to
climbing
naturally
so
his
pig
must
have
climbed
out
of
the
pound
this
of
course
was
all
a
story
the
men
had
lifted
the
pig
out
of
the
pound
and
then
killed
it
so
that
the
farmer
might
not
find
it
and
sold
the
meat
cheap
all
over
the
parish
betty
went
to
the
farmer
that
morning
and
paid
the
half
crown
and
got
her
son
pig
out
before
he
came
home
but
farmer
tester
stopped
the
other
half
crown
out
of
the
men
wages
which
made
matters
worse
then
ever
the
day
that
we
were
in
the
theatre
at
oxford
farmer
tester
was
away
at
one
of
the
markets
he
turns
his
big
cattle
out
to
graze
on
the
common
which
the
poor
people
say
he
has
no
right
to
do
and
in
the
afternoon
a
pony
of
his
got
into
the
allotments
and
betty
son
caught
it
and
took
it
to
the
constable
and
had
it
put
in
the
pound
the
constable
tried
to
persuade
him
not
to
do
it
but
it
was
of
no
use
and
so
when
farmer
tester
came
home
he
found
that
his
turn
had
come
i
am
afraid
that
he
was
not
sober
for
i
hear
that
he
behaved
dreadfully
both
to
the
constable
and
to
betty
son
and
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
frighten
them
he
declared
he
would
have
the
law
of
them
if
it
cost
him
twenty
pounds
so
in
the
morning
he
went
to
fetch
his
lawyer
and
when
we
got
home
you
can
fancy
what
a
scene
it
was
you
remember
how
poorly
papa
was
when
you
left
us
at
lambourn
by
the
time
we
got
home
he
was
quite
knocked
up
and
so
nervous
that
he
was
fit
for
nothing
except
to
have
a
quiet
cup
of
tea
in
his
own
room
i
was
sure
as
we
drove
up
the
street
there
was
something
the
matter
the
ostler
was
watching
outside
the
red
lion
and
ran
in
as
soon
as
we
came
in
sight
and
as
we
passed
the
door
out
came
farmer
tester
looking
very
flushed
in
the
face
and
carrying
his
great
whip
and
a
person
with
him
who
i
found
was
his
lawyer
and
they
marched
after
the
carriage
then
the
constable
was
standing
at
his
door
too
and
he
came
after
us
and
there
was
a
group
of
men
outside
the
rectory
gate
we
had
not
been
in
the
house
five
minutes
before
a
servant
came
in
to
say
that
farmer
tester
and
a
gentlemen
wanted
to
see
papa
on
particular
business
papa
sent
out
word
that
he
was
very
unwell
and
that
it
was
not
the
proper
time
to
come
on
business
he
would
see
them
the
next
day
at
twelve
but
they
would
not
go
away
and
then
papa
asked
me
to
go
out
and
see
them
you
can
fancy
how
disagreeable
it
was
and
i
was
so
angry
with
them
for
coming
when
they
knew
how
nervous
papa
is
after
a
journey
that
i
could
not
have
patience
to
persuade
them
to
leave
and
so
at
last
they
made
poor
papa
see
them
after
all
he
was
lying
on
a
sofa
and
quite
unfit
to
cope
with
a
hard
bad
man
like
farmer
tester
and
a
fluent
plausible
lawyer
they
told
their
story
all
their
own
way
and
the
farmer
declared
that
the
man
had
tempted
the
pony
into
the
allotment
with
corn
and
the
lawyer
said
that
the
constable
had
no
right
to
keep
the
pony
in
the
pound
that
he
was
liable
to
all
sorts
of
punishments
they
wanted
papa
to
make
an
order
at
once
for
the
pound
to
be
opened
and
i
think
he
would
have
done
so
but
i
asked
him
in
a
whisper
to
send
for
the
constable
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
the
constable
was
waiting
in
the
kitchen
so
he
came
in
in
a
minute
you
ca
think
how
well
he
behaved
i
have
quite
forgiven
him
all
his
obstinacy
about
the
singing
he
told
the
whole
story
about
the
pigs
and
how
farmer
tester
had
stopped
money
out
of
the
men
wages
and
when
the
lawyer
tried
to
frighten
him
he
answered
him
quite
boldly
that
he
might
know
so
much
about
the
law
but
he
knew
what
was
always
the
custom
long
before
his
time
at
englebourn
about
the
pound
and
if
farmer
tester
wanted
his
beast
out
he
must
bring
the
like
another
man
then
the
lawyer
appealed
to
papa
about
the
law
and
said
how
absurd
it
was
and
that
if
such
a
custom
were
to
be
upheld
the
man
who
had
the
might
charge
for
the
damage
and
poor
papa
looked
through
his
law
books
and
could
find
nothing
about
it
at
all
and
while
he
was
doing
it
farmer
tester
began
to
abuse
the
constable
and
said
he
sided
with
all
the
fellows
in
the
parish
and
that
bad
blood
would
come
of
it
but
the
constable
quite
fired
up
at
that
and
told
him
that
it
was
such
as
he
who
made
bad
blood
in
the
parish
and
that
poor
folks
had
their
rights
as
well
as
their
betters
and
should
have
them
as
long
as
he
was
constable
if
he
got
papa
order
to
open
the
pound
he
supposed
he
must
do
it
and
was
not
for
him
to
say
what
was
law
but
henry
winburn
had
had
to
get
the
for
his
pig
from
farmer
tester
and
what
was
fair
for
one
was
fair
for
all
i
was
afraid
papa
would
have
made
the
order
but
the
lawyer
said
something
at
last
which
made
him
take
the
other
side
so
he
settled
that
the
farmer
should
pay
five
shillings
for
the
which
was
what
he
had
taken
from
betty
and
had
stopped
out
of
the
wages
and
that
was
the
only
order
he
would
make
and
the
lawyer
might
do
what
he
pleased
about
it
the
constable
seemed
satisfied
with
this
and
undertook
to
take
the
money
down
to
harry
winburn
for
farmer
tester
declared
he
would
sooner
let
the
pony
starve
than
go
himself
and
so
papa
got
rid
of
them
after
an
hour
and
more
of
this
talk
the
lawyer
and
farmer
tester
went
away
grumbling
and
very
angry
to
the
red
lion
i
was
very
anxious
to
hear
how
the
matter
ended
so
i
went
after
the
constable
to
ask
him
to
come
back
and
see
me
when
he
had
settled
it
all
and
about
nine
he
came
he
had
had
a
very
hard
job
to
get
harry
winburn
to
take
the
money
and
give
up
the
the
men
said
that
if
farmer
tester
could
make
them
pay
for
a
pig
in
his
turnips
which
were
no
bigger
than
radishes
he
ought
to
pay
ten
shillings
at
least
for
his
pony
trampling
down
their
corn
which
was
half
grown
and
i
help
thinking
this
seemed
very
reasonable
in
the
end
however
the
constable
had
persuaded
them
to
take
the
money
and
so
the
pony
was
let
out
i
told
him
how
pleased
i
was
at
the
way
he
had
behaved
but
the
little
man
did
seem
quite
satisfied
himself
he
should
have
liked
to
have
given
the
lawyer
a
piece
of
his
mind
he
said
only
he
was
no
scholar
i
a
got
all
the
feelin
of
a
man
miss
though
i
med
have
the
ways
o
bringin
on
out
you
see
i
quite
coming
round
to
your
opinion
about
him
but
when
i
said
that
i
hoped
all
the
trouble
was
over
he
shook
his
head
and
he
seems
to
think
that
the
men
will
not
forget
it
and
that
some
of
the
wild
ones
will
be
trying
to
pay
farmer
tester
out
in
the
winter
nights
and
i
could
see
he
was
very
anxious
about
harry
winburn
so
i
promised
him
to
go
and
see
betty
i
went
down
to
her
cottage
yesterday
and
found
her
very
low
poor
old
soul
about
her
son
she
has
had
a
bad
attack
again
and
i
am
afraid
her
heart
is
not
right
she
will
not
live
long
if
she
has
much
to
make
her
anxious
and
how
is
that
to
be
avoided
for
her
son
courting
is
all
going
wrong
she
can
see
though
he
will
not
tell
her
anything
about
it
but
he
gets
more
moody
and
restless
she
says
and
do
take
a
pride
in
anything
not
even
in
his
flowers
or
his
allotment
and
he
takes
to
going
about
more
and
more
every
day
with
these
men
who
will
be
sure
to
lead
him
into
trouble
after
i
left
her
i
walked
up
to
the
hawk
lynch
to
see
whether
the
view
and
the
air
would
not
do
me
good
and
it
did
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good
dear
and
i
thought
of
you
and
when
i
should
see
your
bright
face
and
hear
your
happy
laugh
again
the
village
looked
so
pretty
and
peaceful
i
could
hardly
believe
while
i
was
up
there
that
there
were
all
these
miserable
quarrels
and
heartburnings
going
on
in
it
i
suppose
they
go
on
everywhere
but
one
ca
help
feeling
as
if
there
was
something
specially
hard
in
those
which
come
under
one
own
eyes
and
touch
one
self
and
then
they
are
so
frivolous
and
everything
might
go
on
so
comfortably
if
people
would
only
be
reasonable
i
ought
to
have
been
a
man
i
am
sure
and
then
i
might
perhaps
be
able
to
do
more
and
should
have
more
influence
if
poor
papa
were
only
well
and
strong
but
dear
i
shall
tire
you
with
all
these
long
histories
and
complainings
i
have
run
on
till
i
have
no
room
left
for
anything
else
but
you
ca
think
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
me
to
write
it
all
to
you
for
i
have
no
one
to
tell
it
to
i
feel
so
much
better
and
more
cheerful
since
i
sat
down
to
write
this
you
must
give
my
dear
love
to
uncle
and
aunt
and
let
me
hear
from
you
again
whenever
you
have
time
if
you
could
come
over
again
and
stay
for
a
few
days
it
would
be
very
kind
but
i
must
not
press
it
as
there
is
nothing
to
attract
you
here
only
we
might
talk
over
all
that
we
did
and
saw
at
ever
dearest
mary
your
affectionate
cousin
katie
i
should
like
to
have
the
pattern
of
the
jacket
you
wore
the
last
day
at
oxford
could
you
cut
it
out
in
thin
paper
and
send
it
in
your
next
my
dear
brown
i
was
very
glad
to
see
your
hand
and
to
hear
such
flourishing
accounts
of
your
vacation
doings
you
wo
get
any
like
announcement
of
me
for
cricket
has
not
yet
come
so
far
west
as
this
at
least
not
to
settle
we
have
a
few
pioneers
and
squatters
in
the
villages
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
nothing
yet
like
matches
between
the
elevens
of
districts
neighbors
we
have
none
except
the
rector
so
i
have
plenty
of
spare
time
some
of
which
i
feel
greatly
disposed
to
devote
to
you
and
i
hope
you
wo
find
me
too
tedious
to
read
it
is
very
kind
of
your
father
to
wish
that
you
should
be
my
first
pupil
and
to
propose
that
i
should
spend
the
last
month
of
this
vacation
with
you
in
berkshire
but
i
do
not
like
to
give
up
a
whole
month
my
father
is
getting
old
and
infirm
and
i
can
see
that
it
would
be
a
great
trial
to
him
although
he
urges
it
and
is
always
telling
me
not
to
let
him
keep
me
at
home
what
do
you
say
to
meeting
me
half
way
i
mean
that
you
should
come
here
for
half
of
the
time
and
then
that
i
should
return
with
you
for
the
last
fortnight
of
the
vacation
this
i
could
manage
perfectly
but
you
can
not
in
any
case
be
my
first
pupil
for
not
to
mention
that
i
have
been
as
you
know
teaching
for
some
years
i
have
a
pupil
here
at
this
minute
you
are
not
likely
to
guess
who
it
is
though
you
know
him
well
enough
perhaps
i
should
say
too
well
so
in
a
word
it
is
blake
i
had
not
been
at
home
three
days
before
i
got
a
letter
from
him
asking
me
to
take
him
and
putting
it
in
such
a
way
that
i
could
refuse
i
would
sooner
not
have
had
him
as
i
had
already
got
out
of
taking
a
reading
party
with
some
trouble
and
felt
inclined
to
enjoy
myself
here
in
dignified
idleness
till
next
term
but
what
can
you
do
when
a
man
puts
it
to
you
as
a
great
personal
favor
so
i
wrote
to
accept
you
may
imagine
my
disgust
a
day
or
two
afterwards
at
getting
a
letter
from
an
uncle
of
his
some
official
person
in
london
apparently
treating
the
whole
matter
in
a
point
of
view
and
me
as
if
i
were
a
training
groom
he
is
good
enough
to
suggest
a
stimulant
to
me
in
the
shape
of
extra
pay
and
his
future
patronage
in
the
event
of
his
nephew
taking
a
first
in
michaelmas
term
if
i
had
received
this
letter
before
i
think
it
would
have
turned
the
scale
and
i
should
have
refused
but
the
thing
was
done
and
blake
is
fairly
responsible
for
his
relative
views
so
here
he
has
been
for
a
fortnight
he
took
a
lodging
in
the
village
at
first
but
of
course
my
dear
old
father
ideas
of
hospitality
were
shocked
at
this
and
here
he
is
our
inmate
he
reads
fiercely
by
fits
and
starts
a
feeling
of
personal
hatred
against
the
examiners
seems
to
urge
him
on
more
than
any
other
motive
but
this
will
not
be
strong
enough
to
keep
him
to
regular
work
and
without
regular
work
he
wo
do
notwithstanding
all
his
cleverness
and
he
is
a
marvellously
clever
fellow
so
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
to
get
him
steadily
to
the
collar
and
how
to
do
it
is
a
pretty
particular
puzzle
for
he
has
a
grain
of
enthusiasm
in
his
composition
nor
any
power
as
far
as
i
can
see
of
throwing
himself
into
the
times
and
scenes
of
which
he
is
reading
the
philosophy
of
greece
and
the
history
of
rome
are
matters
of
perfect
indifference
to
him
to
be
got
up
by
and
dates
for
examination
and
nothing
more
i
do
think
he
would
care
a
straw
if
socrates
had
never
lived
or
hannibal
had
destroyed
rome
the
greatest
names
and
deeds
of
the
old
world
are
just
so
many
dead
counters
to
jewish
just
as
much
as
the
rest
i
tried
him
with
the
story
of
the
attempt
of
antiochus
epiphanes
to
conquer
the
jews
and
the
glorious
rising
of
all
that
was
living
in
the
holy
land
under
the
maccabees
not
it
bit
of
it
i
could
get
a
spark
out
of
him
he
would
even
read
the
story
because
it
is
in
the
apocrypha
and
so
as
he
said
the
d
d
examiners
could
ask
him
anything
about
it
in
the
schools
then
his
sense
of
duty
is
quiet
undeveloped
he
has
no
notion
of
going
on
doing
anything
disagreeable
because
he
ought
so
here
i
am
at
fault
again
ambition
he
has
in
abundance
in
fact
so
strongly
that
very
likely
it
may
in
the
end
pull
him
through
and
make
him
work
hard
enough
for
his
oxford
purposes
at
any
rate
but
it
wants
repressing
rather
than
encouragement
and
i
certainly
sha
appeal
to
it
you
will
begin
to
think
i
dislike
him
and
want
to
get
rid
of
him
but
it
is
the
case
you
know
what
a
good
temper
he
has
and
how
remarkably
well
he
talks
so
he
makes
himself
very
pleasant
and
my
father
evidently
enjoys
his
company
and
then
to
be
in
constant
intercourse
with
a
subtle
intellect
like
his
is
pleasantly
exciting
and
keeps
one
alive
and
at
high
pressure
though
one
ca
help
always
wishing
that
it
had
a
little
heat
in
it
you
would
be
immensely
amused
if
you
could
drop
in
on
us
i
think
i
have
told
you
or
you
must
have
seen
it
for
yourself
that
my
father
principles
are
true
blue
as
becomes
a
sailor
of
the
time
of
the
great
war
while
his
instincts
and
practice
are
liberal
in
the
extreme
our
rector
on
the
contrary
is
liberal
in
principles
but
an
aristocrat
of
the
aristocrats
in
instinct
and
practice
they
are
always
ready
enough
therefore
to
do
battle
and
blake
delights
in
the
war
and
fans
it
and
takes
part
in
it
as
a
sort
of
free
lance
laying
little
logical
pitfalls
for
the
combatants
alternately
with
that
deferential
manner
of
his
he
gets
some
sort
of
intellectual
pleasure
i
suppose
out
of
seeing
where
they
ought
to
tumble
in
for
tumble
in
they
do
but
clear
his
in
their
least
my
father
innocent
of
having
neglected
to
distribute
his
middle
term
and
the
rector
if
he
has
some
inkling
of
these
traps
brushes
them
aside
and
disdains
to
spend
powder
on
anyone
but
his
old
adversary
and
friend
i
employ
myself
in
trying
to
come
down
ruthlessly
on
blake
himself
and
so
we
spend
our
evenings
after
dinner
which
comes
off
at
the
primitive
hour
of
five
we
used
to
dine
at
three
but
my
father
has
comformed
now
to
college
hours
if
the
rector
does
not
come
instead
of
argumentative
talk
we
get
stories
out
of
my
father
in
the
morning
we
bathe
and
boat
and
read
so
you
see
he
and
i
have
plenty
of
one
another
company
and
it
is
certainly
odd
that
we
get
on
so
well
with
so
very
few
points
of
sympathy
but
luckily
besides
his
good
temper
and
cleverness
he
has
plenty
of
humor
on
the
whole
i
think
we
shall
rub
through
the
two
months
which
he
is
to
spend
here
without
getting
to
hate
one
another
though
there
is
little
chance
of
our
becoming
friends
besides
putting
some
history
and
science
into
him
scholarship
he
does
not
need
i
shall
be
satisfied
if
i
can
make
him
give
up
his
use
of
the
pronoun
before
he
goes
in
talking
of
the
corn
laws
or
foreign
policy
or
india
or
any
other
political
subject
however
interesting
he
never
will
identify
himself
as
an
englishman
and
do
this
or
expect
that
is
for
ever
in
his
mouth
speaking
of
his
own
countrymen
i
believe
if
the
french
were
to
land
on
portland
he
would
comment
on
our
attempts
to
dislodge
them
as
if
he
had
no
concern
with
the
business
except
as
a
you
will
think
all
this
rather
a
slow
return
for
your
jolly
gossiping
letter
full
of
cricket
archery
fishing
and
i
know
not
what
pleasant
but
what
is
one
to
do
one
can
only
write
about
what
is
one
subject
of
interest
for
the
time
being
and
blake
stands
in
that
relation
to
me
just
now
i
should
prefer
it
otherwise
but
on
pas
ce
aime
il
faut
aimer
ce
i
have
no
incident
to
relate
these
parts
get
on
without
incidents
somehow
and
without
society
i
wish
there
were
some
particularly
ladies
society
i
break
the
tenth
commandment
constantly
thinking
of
commemoration
and
that
you
are
within
a
ride
of
miss
winter
and
her
cousin
when
you
see
them
next
pray
present
my
respectful
compliments
it
is
a
sort
of
consolation
to
think
that
one
may
cross
their
fancy
for
a
moment
and
be
remembered
as
part
of
a
picture
which
gives
them
pleasure
with
such
piece
of
sentiment
i
may
as
well
shut
up
do
you
forget
my
message
now
and
believe
me
ever
yours
most
truly
john
hardy
i
mean
to
speak
to
blake
when
i
get
a
chance
of
that
wretched
debt
which
you
have
paid
unless
you
object
i
should
think
better
of
him
if
he
seemed
more
uncomfortable
about
his
affairs
after
all
he
may
be
more
so
than
i
think
for
he
is
very
reserved
on
such
subjects
englebourn
rectory
july
dearest
i
send
the
coachman
with
this
note
in
order
that
you
may
not
be
anxious
about
me
i
have
just
returned
from
poor
betty
winburn
cottage
to
write
it
she
is
very
very
ill
and
i
do
not
think
can
last
out
more
than
a
day
or
two
and
she
seems
to
cling
to
me
so
that
i
can
not
have
the
heart
to
leave
her
indeed
if
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
i
should
never
get
her
poor
white
eager
face
out
of
my
head
all
day
so
that
i
should
be
very
bad
company
and
quite
out
of
place
at
your
party
making
everybody
melancholy
and
uncomfortable
who
came
near
me
so
dear
i
am
not
coming
of
course
it
is
a
great
disappointment
i
had
set
my
heart
on
being
with
you
and
enjoying
it
all
thoroughly
and
even
at
breakfast
this
morning
knew
of
nothing
to
hinder
me
my
dress
is
actually
lying
on
the
bed
at
this
minute
and
it
looks
very
pretty
especially
the
jacket
like
yours
which
i
and
hopkins
have
managed
to
make
up
from
the
pattern
you
sent
though
you
forgot
the
sleeves
which
made
it
rather
hard
to
do
ah
well
it
is
no
use
to
think
of
how
pleasant
things
would
have
been
which
one
can
not
have
you
must
write
me
an
account
of
how
it
all
went
off
dear
or
perhaps
you
can
manage
to
get
over
here
before
long
to
tell
me
i
must
now
go
back
to
poor
betty
she
is
such
a
faithful
patient
old
thing
and
has
been
such
a
good
woman
all
her
life
that
there
is
nothing
painful
in
being
by
her
now
and
one
feels
sure
that
it
will
be
much
happier
and
better
for
her
to
be
at
rest
if
she
could
only
feel
comfortable
about
her
son
i
am
sure
she
would
think
so
herself
oh
i
forgot
to
say
that
her
attack
was
brought
on
by
the
shock
of
hearing
that
he
had
been
summoned
for
an
assault
farmer
tester
son
a
young
man
about
his
own
age
has
it
seems
been
of
late
waylaying
simon
daughter
and
making
love
to
her
it
is
so
very
hard
to
make
out
the
truth
in
matters
of
this
kind
hopkins
says
she
is
a
little
minx
who
runs
after
all
the
young
men
in
the
parish
but
really
from
what
i
see
and
hear
from
other
persons
i
think
she
is
a
good
girl
enough
even
betty
who
looks
on
her
as
the
cause
of
most
of
her
own
trouble
has
never
said
a
word
to
make
me
think
that
she
is
at
all
a
light
person
or
more
fond
of
admiration
than
any
other
girl
in
the
parish
but
those
testers
are
a
very
wicked
set
you
can
not
think
what
a
misfortune
it
is
in
a
place
like
this
to
have
these
rich
families
with
estates
of
their
own
in
which
the
young
men
begin
to
think
themselves
above
the
common
farmers
they
ape
the
gentlemen
and
give
themselves
great
airs
but
of
course
no
gentleman
will
associate
with
them
as
they
are
quite
uneducated
and
the
consequence
is
that
they
live
a
great
deal
at
home
and
give
themselves
up
to
all
kinds
of
wickedness
this
young
tester
is
one
of
these
his
father
is
a
very
bad
old
man
and
does
a
great
deal
of
harm
here
and
the
son
is
following
in
his
steps
and
is
quite
as
bad
or
worse
so
you
see
that
i
shall
not
easily
believe
that
harry
winburn
has
been
much
in
the
wrong
however
all
i
know
of
it
at
present
is
that
young
tester
was
beaten
by
harry
yesterday
evening
in
the
village
street
and
that
they
came
to
papa
at
once
for
a
summons
oh
here
is
the
coachman
ready
to
start
so
i
must
conclude
dear
and
go
back
to
my
patient
i
shall
often
think
of
you
during
the
day
i
am
sure
you
will
have
a
charming
party
with
best
love
to
all
believe
me
ever
dearest
your
most
affectionate
katie
i
am
very
glad
that
uncle
and
aunt
take
to
tom
and
that
he
is
staying
with
you
for
some
days
you
will
find
him
very
useful
in
making
the
party
go
off
well
i
am
sure
chapter
xxx
amusements
at
barton
manor
a
letter
miss
from
englebourn
said
a
footman
coming
up
to
mary
with
the
note
given
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
on
a
waiter
she
took
it
and
tore
it
open
and
while
she
is
reading
it
the
reader
may
be
introduced
to
the
place
and
company
in
which
we
find
her
the
scene
is
a
large
square
brick
house
backed
by
fine
trees
in
the
tops
of
which
the
rooks
live
and
the
jackdaws
and
starlings
in
the
many
holes
which
time
has
worn
in
the
old
trunks
but
they
are
all
away
on
this
fine
summer
morning
seeking
their
meal
and
enjoying
themselves
in
the
neighbouring
fields
in
the
front
of
the
house
is
a
pretty
flower
garden
separated
by
a
from
a
large
pasture
sloping
southwards
gently
down
to
a
stream
which
glides
along
through
and
willow
beds
to
join
the
kennet
the
beasts
have
all
been
driven
off
and
on
the
upper
part
of
the
field
nearest
the
house
two
men
are
fixing
up
a
third
pair
of
targets
on
the
rich
short
grass
a
large
tent
is
pitched
near
the
archery
ground
to
hold
quivers
and
and
luncheon
and
to
shelter
from
the
sun
beyond
the
brook
a
pleasant
country
lies
with
high
for
an
horizon
ending
in
marlborough
hill
faint
and
blue
in
the
west
this
is
the
place
which
mary
father
has
taken
for
the
summer
and
autumn
and
where
she
is
fast
becoming
the
pet
of
the
neighborhood
it
will
not
perhaps
surprise
our
readers
to
find
that
our
hero
has
managed
to
find
his
way
to
barton
manor
in
the
second
week
of
the
vacation
and
having
made
the
most
of
his
opportunities
is
acknowledged
as
a
cousin
by
and
porter
their
boys
are
at
home
for
the
holidays
and
porter
great
wish
is
that
they
should
get
used
to
the
country
in
their
summer
holidays
and
as
they
have
spent
most
of
their
childhood
and
boyhood
in
london
to
which
he
has
been
tied
pretty
closely
hitherto
this
is
a
great
opportunity
the
boys
only
wanted
a
preceptor
and
tom
presented
himself
at
the
right
moment
and
soon
became
the
hero
of
charley
and
neddy
porter
he
taught
them
to
throw
flies
and
bait
crawfish
nets
to
and
ferret
for
rabbits
and
to
saddle
and
ride
their
ponies
besides
getting
up
games
of
cricket
in
the
spare
evenings
which
kept
him
away
from
this
last
piece
of
as
he
considered
it
quite
won
over
that
gentleman
who
agreed
with
his
wife
that
tom
was
just
the
sort
of
companion
they
would
like
for
the
boys
and
so
the
house
was
thrown
open
to
him
the
boys
were
always
clamouring
for
him
when
he
was
away
and
making
their
mother
write
off
to
press
him
to
come
again
which
he
being
a
very
young
man
and
particularly
fond
of
boys
was
ready
enough
to
do
so
this
was
the
third
visit
he
had
paid
in
a
month
and
brown
wondered
a
little
that
he
should
be
so
very
fond
of
the
young
porters
who
were
good
boys
enough
but
very
much
like
other
boys
of
thirteen
and
fifteen
of
whom
there
were
several
in
the
neighborhood
he
had
indeed
just
mentioned
an
elder
sister
but
so
casually
that
their
attention
had
not
been
drawn
to
the
fact
which
had
almost
slipped
out
of
their
memories
on
the
other
hand
tom
seemed
so
completely
to
identify
himself
with
the
boys
and
their
pursuits
that
it
never
occurred
to
their
father
and
mother
who
were
doatingly
fond
of
them
that
after
all
they
might
not
be
the
only
attraction
mary
seemed
to
take
very
little
notice
of
him
and
went
on
with
her
own
pursuits
much
as
usual
it
was
true
that
she
liked
keeping
the
score
at
cricket
and
coming
to
look
at
them
fishing
or
rabbiting
in
her
walks
but
all
that
was
very
natural
it
is
a
curious
and
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
that
most
fathers
and
mothers
seem
never
to
be
capable
of
remembering
their
own
experience
and
will
probably
go
on
till
the
end
of
time
thinking
of
their
sons
of
twenty
and
daughters
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
as
mere
children
who
may
be
allowed
to
run
about
together
as
much
as
they
please
and
where
it
is
otherwise
the
results
are
not
very
different
for
there
are
certain
mysterious
ways
of
holding
intercourse
implanted
in
the
youth
of
both
sexes
against
which
no
vigilance
can
prevail
so
on
this
her
great
fete
day
tom
had
been
helping
mary
all
the
morning
in
dressing
the
rooms
with
flowers
and
arranging
all
the
details
where
people
were
to
sit
at
cold
dinner
how
to
find
the
proper
number
of
seats
how
the
was
to
be
cleared
in
time
for
dancing
when
the
dew
began
to
fall
in
all
which
matters
there
were
many
obvious
occasions
for
those
little
attentions
which
are
much
valued
by
persons
in
like
situations
and
tom
was
not
sorry
that
the
boys
had
voted
the
whole
preparations
a
bore
and
had
gone
off
to
the
brook
to
in
the
bank
for
crayfish
till
the
shooting
began
the
arrival
of
the
note
had
been
the
first
of
the
morning
and
they
were
now
expecting
guests
to
arrive
every
minute
what
is
the
matter
no
bad
news
i
hope
he
said
seeing
her
vexed
expression
why
katie
ca
come
i
declare
i
could
sit
down
and
cry
i
enjoy
the
party
a
bit
now
and
i
wish
it
were
all
over
i
am
sure
katie
would
be
very
unhappy
if
she
thought
you
were
going
to
spoil
your
day
pleasure
on
her
account
yes
i
know
she
would
but
it
is
so
provoking
when
i
had
looked
forward
so
to
having
her
you
have
never
told
me
why
she
can
not
come
she
was
quite
full
of
it
all
a
few
days
since
oh
there
is
a
poor
old
woman
in
the
village
dying
who
is
a
great
friend
of
katie
here
is
her
letter
let
me
see
she
said
glancing
over
it
to
see
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
she
did
not
wish
him
to
read
you
may
read
it
if
you
like
tom
began
reading
betty
winburn
he
said
when
he
came
to
the
name
what
poor
dear
old
betty
why
i
known
her
ever
since
i
was
born
she
used
to
live
in
our
parish
and
i
have
seen
her
this
eight
years
nearly
and
her
boy
harry
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
him
you
will
see
if
you
read
on
said
mary
and
so
he
read
to
the
end
and
then
folded
it
up
and
returned
it
so
poor
old
betty
is
dying
well
she
was
always
a
good
soul
and
very
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
boy
i
should
like
to
see
her
once
again
and
perhaps
i
might
be
able
to
do
something
for
her
son
why
should
we
not
ride
over
to
englebourn
they
will
be
glad
to
get
us
out
of
the
way
while
the
house
is
being
straightened
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
if
it
can
be
managed
oh
i
will
manage
it
somehow
for
i
must
go
and
see
that
dear
katie
i
do
feel
so
ashamed
of
myself
when
i
think
of
all
the
good
she
is
doing
and
i
do
nothing
but
put
flowers
about
and
play
the
piano
is
she
an
angel
now
of
course
she
is
yes
but
i
wo
have
that
sort
of
acquiescence
now
do
you
really
mean
that
katie
is
as
good
as
an
angel
as
seriously
as
if
i
saw
the
wings
growing
out
of
her
shoulders
and
dew
drops
hanging
on
them
you
deserve
to
have
some
thing
not
at
all
like
wings
growing
out
of
your
head
how
is
it
that
you
never
see
when
i
do
want
you
to
talk
your
nonsense
how
am
i
to
talk
sense
about
angels
i
do
know
anything
about
them
you
know
what
i
mean
perfectly
i
say
that
dear
katie
is
an
angel
and
i
mean
that
i
do
know
anything
in
her
no
not
one
single
thing
which
i
should
like
to
have
changed
if
the
angels
are
all
as
good
as
she
why
i
shall
begin
to
doubt
your
orthodoxy
you
do
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
it
does
matter
what
you
were
going
to
say
you
could
have
brought
that
sentence
into
an
orthodox
conclusion
oh
please
do
look
so
angry
now
yes
i
quite
see
what
you
mean
you
can
think
of
katie
just
as
she
is
now
in
heaven
without
being
shocked
mary
paused
for
a
moment
before
she
answered
as
if
taken
by
surprise
at
this
way
of
putting
her
meaning
and
then
said
seriously
indeed
i
can
i
think
we
should
all
be
perfectly
happy
if
we
were
all
as
good
as
she
is
but
she
is
not
very
happy
herself
i
am
afraid
of
course
not
how
can
she
be
when
all
the
people
about
her
are
so
troublesome
and
selfish
i
ca
fancy
an
angel
the
least
bit
like
uncle
robert
can
you
i
wo
talk
about
angels
any
more
you
have
made
me
feel
quite
as
if
i
had
been
saying
something
wicked
now
really
it
is
too
hard
that
you
should
lay
all
the
blame
on
me
when
you
began
the
subject
yourself
you
ought
at
least
to
let
me
say
what
i
have
to
say
about
angels
why
you
said
you
knew
nothing
about
them
half
a
minute
ago
but
i
may
have
my
notions
like
other
people
you
have
your
notions
katie
is
your
angel
well
then
what
are
your
notions
katie
is
rather
too
dark
for
my
idea
of
an
angel
i
ca
fancy
a
dark
angel
why
how
can
you
call
katie
dark
i
only
say
she
is
too
dark
for
my
idea
of
an
angel
well
go
on
then
she
is
rather
too
grave
too
grave
for
an
angel
for
my
idea
of
an
angel
one
does
want
one
angel
to
be
like
oneself
and
i
am
so
grave
you
know
yes
very
then
your
angel
is
to
be
a
laughing
angel
a
laughing
angel
and
yet
very
sensible
never
talking
nonsense
oh
i
did
say
that
but
you
said
he
was
to
be
like
you
who
in
the
world
do
you
mean
by
why
your
angel
of
course
my
angel
you
do
really
suppose
that
my
angel
is
to
be
a
man
i
have
no
time
to
think
about
it
look
they
are
putting
those
targets
quite
crooked
you
are
responsible
for
the
targets
we
must
go
and
get
them
straight
they
walked
across
the
ground
towards
the
targets
and
tom
settled
them
according
to
his
notions
of
opposites
after
all
archery
is
slow
work
he
said
when
the
targets
were
settled
satisfactorily
i
do
believe
anybody
really
enjoys
it
now
that
is
because
you
men
have
it
all
to
yourselves
you
are
jealous
of
any
sort
of
game
in
which
we
can
join
i
believe
you
are
afraid
of
being
beaten
by
us
on
the
contrary
that
is
its
only
recommendation
that
you
can
join
in
it
well
i
think
that
ought
to
be
recommendation
enough
but
i
believe
it
is
much
harder
than
most
of
your
games
you
shoot
half
so
well
as
you
can
play
cricket
can
you
no
because
i
never
practice
it
is
exciting
to
be
walking
up
and
down
between
two
targets
and
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
why
you
do
find
it
so
yourself
you
hardly
ever
shoot
indeed
i
do
though
constantly
why
i
have
scarcely
ever
seen
you
shooting
that
is
because
you
are
away
with
the
boys
all
day
oh
i
am
never
too
far
to
know
what
is
going
on
i
sure
you
have
never
practised
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
any
day
i
have
been
here
well
perhaps
i
may
not
have
but
i
tell
you
i
am
very
fond
of
it
here
the
two
boys
came
up
from
the
brook
neddy
with
his
scotch
cap
full
of
crayfish
why
you
wretched
boys
where
have
you
been
you
are
not
fit
to
be
seen
said
mary
shaking
the
arrows
at
them
which
she
was
carrying
in
her
hand
go
and
dress
directly
or
you
will
be
late
i
think
i
heard
a
carriage
driving
up
just
now
oh
there
plenty
of
time
look
what
whackers
cousin
tom
said
charley
holding
out
one
of
his
prizes
by
its
back
towards
tom
while
the
indignant
crayfish
flapped
its
tail
and
worked
around
with
its
claws
in
hopes
of
getting
hold
of
something
to
pinch
i
do
believe
those
boys
have
been
dry
for
two
hours
together
in
daylight
since
you
first
came
here
said
mary
to
tom
well
and
they
all
the
better
for
it
i
sure
said
tom
yes
that
we
are
said
charley
i
say
charley
said
tom
your
sister
says
she
is
very
fond
of
shooting
ay
and
so
she
is
and
is
she
a
good
shot
too
i
believe
she
would
beat
you
at
fifty
yards
there
now
you
see
you
need
not
have
been
so
unbelieving
said
mary
will
you
give
her
a
shot
at
your
new
hat
cousin
tom
said
neddy
yes
neddy
that
i
will
and
he
added
to
mary
i
will
bet
you
a
pair
of
gloves
that
you
do
hit
it
in
three
shots
very
well
said
mary
at
thirty
yards
no
no
fifty
yards
was
the
named
distance
no
fifty
yards
is
too
far
why
you
hat
is
not
much
bigger
than
the
gold
well
i
do
mind
splitting
the
difference
we
will
say
forty
very
well
three
shots
at
forty
yards
yes
here
charley
run
and
hang
my
hat
on
that
target
the
boys
rushed
off
with
the
hat
a
new
white
one
and
hung
it
with
a
bit
of
string
over
the
center
of
one
of
the
targets
and
then
stepping
a
little
aside
stood
clapping
their
hands
shouting
to
mary
to
take
good
aim
you
must
string
my
bow
she
said
handing
it
to
him
as
she
buckled
on
her
guard
now
do
you
repent
i
am
going
to
do
my
best
mind
if
i
do
shoot
i
scorn
repentance
do
your
worst
said
tom
stringing
the
bow
and
handing
it
back
to
her
and
now
i
will
hold
your
arrows
here
is
the
forty
yards
mary
came
to
the
place
which
he
had
stepped
her
eyes
full
of
fun
and
mischief
and
he
saw
at
once
that
she
knew
what
she
was
about
as
she
took
her
position
and
drew
the
first
arrow
it
missed
the
hat
by
some
three
inches
only
and
the
boys
clapped
and
shouted
too
near
to
be
pleasant
said
tom
handing
the
second
arrow
i
see
you
can
shoot
well
i
will
let
you
off
still
gloves
and
all
no
of
course
you
must
pay
the
gloves
shoot
away
then
ah
that
will
do
he
cried
as
the
second
arrow
struck
considerably
above
the
hat
i
shall
get
my
gloves
yet
and
he
handed
the
third
arrow
they
were
too
intent
on
the
business
in
hand
to
observe
that
and
porter
and
several
guests
were
already
on
the
which
crossed
the
mary
drew
her
third
arrow
paused
a
moment
loosed
it
and
this
time
with
fatal
aim
the
boys
rushed
to
the
target
towards
which
mary
and
tom
also
hurried
and
porter
and
the
new
comers
following
more
quietly
oh
look
here
what
fun
said
charley
as
tom
came
up
holding
up
the
hat
spiked
on
the
arrow
which
he
had
drawn
out
of
the
target
what
a
wicked
shot
he
said
taking
the
hat
and
turning
to
mary
look
here
you
have
actually
gone
through
three
places
through
crown
and
side
and
brim
mary
began
to
feel
quite
sorry
at
her
own
success
and
looked
at
the
wounded
hat
sorrowfully
hullo
look
here
here
papa
and
mamma
and
some
people
and
we
ai
dressed
come
along
neddy
and
the
boys
made
off
towards
the
back
premises
while
mary
and
tom
turning
round
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
and
porter
brown
and
two
or
three
other
guests
chapter
xxxi
behind
the
scenes
and
brown
had
a
long
way
to
drive
home
that
evening
including
some
eight
miles
of
very
indifferent
chalky
road
over
the
downs
which
separate
the
vale
of
kennet
from
the
vale
of
white
horse
brown
was
an
early
man
and
careful
of
his
horses
who
responded
to
his
care
by
being
always
well
up
to
much
more
work
than
they
were
ever
put
to
the
drive
to
barton
manor
and
back
in
a
day
was
a
rare
event
in
their
lives
their
master
taking
this
fact
into
consideration
was
bent
on
giving
them
plenty
of
time
for
the
return
journey
and
had
ordered
his
groom
to
be
ready
to
start
by
eight
but
that
they
might
not
disturb
the
rest
by
their
early
departure
he
had
sent
the
carriage
to
the
village
inn
instead
of
to
the
porter
stables
at
the
appointed
time
therefore
and
when
the
amusements
were
just
beginning
at
the
manor
house
brown
sought
out
his
wife
and
after
a
few
words
of
to
their
host
and
hostess
the
two
slipped
quietly
away
and
walked
down
the
village
the
carriage
was
standing
before
the
inn
all
ready
for
them
with
the
hostler
and
brown
groom
at
the
horses
heads
the
carriage
was
a
high
phaeton
having
a
roomy
front
seat
with
a
hood
to
it
specially
devised
by
brown
with
a
view
to
his
wife
comfort
and
that
he
might
with
a
good
conscience
enjoy
at
the
same
time
the
pleasures
of
her
society
and
of
driving
his
own
horses
when
once
in
her
place
brown
was
as
comfortable
as
she
would
have
been
in
the
most
luxurious
barouche
with
c
springs
but
the
ascent
was
certainly
rather
a
drawback
the
pleasure
of
sitting
by
her
husband
and
of
receiving
his
assiduous
help
in
the
preliminary
climb
however
more
than
compensated
to
brown
for
this
little
inconvenience
brown
helped
her
up
as
usual
and
arranged
a
plaid
carefully
over
her
knees
the
weather
being
too
hot
for
the
apron
he
then
proceeded
to
walk
round
the
horses
patting
them
examining
the
bits
and
making
inquiries
as
to
how
they
had
fed
having
satisfied
himself
on
these
points
and
fee
the
hostler
he
took
the
reins
seated
himself
by
his
wife
and
started
at
a
steady
pace
towards
the
hills
at
the
back
of
barton
village
for
a
minute
or
two
neither
of
them
spoke
brown
being
engrossed
with
his
horses
and
she
with
her
thoughts
presently
however
he
turned
to
her
and
having
ascertained
that
she
was
quite
comfortable
went
on
well
my
dear
what
do
you
think
of
them
oh
i
think
they
are
agreeable
people
answered
brown
but
one
can
scarcely
judge
from
seeing
them
it
is
too
far
for
a
drive
we
shall
not
be
home
till
midnight
but
i
am
very
glad
we
came
after
all
they
are
connexions
through
poor
robert
and
he
seems
anxious
that
they
should
start
well
in
the
county
why
he
has
actually
written
twice
you
know
about
our
coming
up
we
must
try
to
show
them
some
civility
it
is
impossible
to
come
so
far
often
brown
persisted
it
is
too
far
for
ordinary
visiting
what
do
you
say
to
asking
them
to
come
and
spend
a
day
or
two
with
us
certainly
my
dear
if
you
wish
it
answered
brown
but
without
much
cordiality
in
her
voice
yes
i
should
like
it
and
it
will
please
robert
so
much
we
might
have
him
and
katie
over
to
meet
them
do
you
think
let
me
see
said
brown
with
much
more
alacrity
and
porter
will
have
the
best
and
robert
must
have
the
south
room
and
katie
the
chintz
yes
that
will
do
i
can
manage
it
very
well
and
their
daughter
you
have
forgotten
her
well
you
see
dear
there
is
no
more
room
why
there
is
the
next
to
the
south
room
with
a
bed
in
it
i
sure
nobody
can
want
a
better
room
you
know
john
that
robert
can
not
sleep
if
there
is
the
least
noise
i
could
never
put
into
his
there
is
only
a
single
door
between
the
rooms
and
even
if
they
made
no
noise
the
fancy
that
some
one
was
sleeping
there
would
keep
him
awake
all
night
plague
take
his
fancies
robert
has
given
way
to
them
till
he
is
fit
for
nothing
but
you
can
put
him
in
the
chintz
room
and
give
the
two
girls
the
south
bed
room
and
what
put
robert
in
a
room
which
looks
north
my
dear
john
what
can
you
be
thinking
about
brown
uttered
an
impatient
grunt
and
as
a
vent
to
his
feelings
more
decorous
on
the
whole
than
abusing
his
drew
his
whip
more
smartly
than
usual
across
the
backs
of
his
horses
the
exertion
of
muscle
necessary
to
reduce
those
astonished
animals
to
their
accustomed
steady
trot
restored
his
temper
and
he
returned
to
the
charge
i
suppose
we
must
manage
it
on
the
second
floor
then
unless
you
could
get
a
bed
run
up
in
the
no
dear
i
really
should
not
like
to
do
that
it
would
be
so
very
inconvenient
we
are
always
wanting
the
room
for
workwomen
or
servants
besides
i
keep
my
account
books
and
other
things
there
then
i
afraid
it
must
be
on
the
second
floor
some
of
the
children
must
be
moved
the
girl
seems
a
nice
girl
with
no
nonsense
about
her
and
wo
mind
sleeping
up
there
or
why
not
put
katie
upstairs
indeed
i
should
not
think
of
it
katie
is
a
dear
good
girl
and
i
will
not
put
anyone
over
her
head
nor
i
dear
on
the
contrary
i
was
asking
you
to
put
her
over
another
person
head
said
brown
laughing
at
his
own
joke
this
unusual
reluctance
on
the
part
of
his
wife
to
assist
in
carrying
out
any
hospitable
plans
of
his
began
to
strike
him
so
not
being
an
adept
at
concealing
his
thoughts
or
gaining
his
point
by
any
attack
except
a
direct
one
after
driving
on
for
a
minute
in
silence
he
turned
suddenly
on
his
wife
and
said
why
lizzie
you
seem
not
to
want
to
ask
the
girl
well
john
i
do
not
see
the
need
of
it
at
all
no
and
you
do
want
to
ask
her
if
you
must
know
then
i
do
not
do
you
like
her
i
do
not
know
her
well
enough
either
to
like
or
dislike
then
why
not
ask
her
and
see
what
she
is
like
but
the
truth
is
lizzie
you
have
taken
a
prejudice
against
her
well
john
i
think
she
is
a
thoughtless
girl
and
extravagant
not
the
sort
of
girl
in
fact
that
i
should
wish
to
be
much
with
us
thoughtless
and
extravagant
said
brown
looking
grave
how
you
women
can
be
so
sharp
on
one
another
her
dress
seemed
to
me
simple
and
pretty
and
her
manners
very
and
pleasing
you
seem
to
have
quite
forgotten
about
tom
hat
said
brown
tom
white
hat
so
i
had
said
brown
and
he
relapsed
into
a
low
laugh
at
the
remembrance
of
the
scene
i
call
that
extravagance
and
not
hers
it
was
a
new
hat
and
a
very
expensive
one
which
he
had
bought
for
the
vacation
and
it
is
quite
spoilt
well
my
dear
really
if
tom
will
let
girls
shoot
at
his
hats
he
must
take
the
consequences
he
must
wear
it
with
the
holes
or
buy
another
how
can
he
afford
another
john
you
know
how
poor
he
is
brown
drove
on
now
for
several
minutes
without
speaking
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
his
wife
was
coming
to
now
and
after
weighing
in
his
mind
the
alternatives
of
accepting
battle
or
making
sail
and
changing
the
subject
altogether
said
you
know
my
dear
he
has
brought
it
on
himself
a
headlong
generous
sort
of
youngster
like
tom
must
be
taught
early
that
he
ca
have
his
cake
and
eat
his
cake
if
he
likes
to
lend
his
money
he
must
find
out
that
he
has
it
to
spend
yes
dear
i
quite
agree
with
you
but
a
year
is
a
great
deal
to
make
him
pay
not
a
bit
too
much
lizzie
his
allowance
is
quite
enough
without
it
to
keep
him
like
a
gentleman
besides
after
all
he
gets
it
in
meal
or
in
malt
i
have
just
paid
for
his
gun
i
know
how
kind
and
liberal
you
are
to
him
only
i
am
so
afraid
of
his
getting
into
debt
i
wonder
what
men
would
do
if
they
had
some
woman
always
ready
to
take
their
parts
and
pull
them
out
of
scrapes
said
brown
well
dear
how
much
do
you
want
to
give
the
boy
pounds
just
for
this
year
but
out
of
my
own
allowance
john
nonsense
replied
brown
you
want
your
allowance
for
yourself
and
the
children
indeed
dear
john
i
would
sooner
not
do
it
at
all
then
if
i
may
not
do
it
out
of
my
own
money
well
have
it
your
own
way
i
believe
you
would
always
look
if
you
never
bought
another
gown
then
to
go
back
to
what
we
were
talking
about
just
now
you
will
find
a
room
for
the
girl
somehow
yes
dear
certainly
as
i
see
you
are
bent
on
it
i
think
it
would
be
scarcely
civil
not
to
ask
her
especially
if
katie
comes
and
i
own
i
think
her
very
pretty
and
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
her
is
it
odd
that
tom
should
never
have
said
anything
about
her
to
us
he
has
talked
of
all
the
rest
till
i
knew
them
quite
well
before
i
went
there
no
it
seems
to
me
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
yes
dear
very
natural
but
i
ca
help
wishing
he
had
talked
about
her
more
i
should
think
it
less
dangerous
oh
you
think
master
tom
is
in
love
with
her
eh
said
brown
laughing
more
unlikely
things
have
happened
you
take
it
very
easily
john
well
we
have
all
been
boys
and
girls
lizzie
the
world
altered
much
i
suppose
since
i
used
to
get
up
at
five
on
winter
mornings
to
ride
some
twenty
miles
to
cover
on
the
chance
of
meeting
a
young
lady
on
a
grey
pony
i
remember
how
my
poor
dear
old
father
used
to
wonder
at
it
when
our
hounds
met
close
by
in
a
better
country
i
afraid
i
forgot
to
tell
him
what
a
pretty
creature
was
and
how
well
she
was
ridden
but
tom
is
only
twenty
and
he
must
go
into
a
profession
yes
yes
much
to
young
i
know
too
young
for
anything
serious
we
had
better
see
them
together
and
then
if
there
is
anything
in
it
we
can
keep
them
apart
there
can
not
be
much
the
matter
yet
well
dear
if
you
are
satisfied
i
am
sure
i
am
and
so
the
conversation
turned
on
other
subjects
and
and
brown
enjoyed
their
moonlight
drive
home
through
the
delicious
summer
night
and
were
quite
sorry
when
the
groom
got
down
from
the
to
open
their
own
gates
at
twelve
about
the
same
time
the
festivities
at
barton
manor
were
coming
to
a
close
there
had
been
cold
dinner
in
the
tent
at
six
after
the
great
match
of
the
day
and
after
dinner
the
announcement
of
the
scores
and
the
distribution
of
prizes
to
the
winners
a
certain
amount
of
toasts
and
speechifying
followed
which
the
ladies
sat
through
with
the
most
exemplary
appearance
of
being
amused
when
their
healths
had
been
proposed
and
acknowledged
they
retired
and
were
soon
followed
by
the
younger
portion
of
the
male
sex
and
while
the
and
clergymen
sat
quietly
at
their
wine
which
porter
took
care
should
be
remarkably
good
and
their
wives
went
to
look
over
the
house
and
have
tea
their
sons
and
daughters
split
up
into
groups
and
some
shot
handicaps
and
some
walked
about
and
flirted
and
some
played
at
bowls
and
lawn
billiards
and
soon
the
band
appeared
again
from
the
servants
hall
mightily
refreshed
and
dancing
began
on
the
grass
and
in
due
time
was
transferred
to
the
tent
when
the
grass
got
damp
with
the
night
dew
and
then
to
the
hall
of
the
house
when
the
lighting
of
the
tent
began
to
fail
and
then
there
came
a
supper
extemporized
out
of
the
remains
of
the
dinner
after
which
papas
and
mammas
began
to
look
at
their
watches
and
remonstrate
with
daughters
coming
up
with
sparkling
eyes
and
hair
a
little
shaken
out
of
place
and
pleading
for
just
one
more
dance
you
have
been
going
on
ever
since
one
remonstrate
the
parents
and
are
ready
to
go
on
till
one
replied
the
children
by
degrees
however
the
frequent
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
and
the
dancers
got
thinner
and
thinner
till
for
the
last
half
hour
some
couples
of
young
people
danced
at
interminable
reel
while
and
porter
and
a
few
of
the
most
matrons
of
the
neighborhood
looked
on
soon
after
midnight
the
band
struck
no
amount
of
negus
could
get
anything
more
out
of
them
but
god
save
the
queen
which
they
accordingly
played
and
departed
and
then
came
the
final
cloaking
and
driving
off
of
the
last
guests
tom
and
mary
saw
the
last
of
them
into
their
carriage
at
the
and
lingered
a
moment
in
the
porch
what
a
lovely
night
said
mary
how
i
hate
going
to
bed
it
is
a
dreadful
bore
answered
tom
but
here
is
the
butler
waiting
to
shut
up
we
must
go
in
i
wonder
where
papa
and
mama
are
oh
they
are
only
seeing
things
put
a
little
to
rights
let
us
sit
here
till
they
come
they
must
pass
by
to
get
to
their
rooms
so
the
two
sat
down
on
some
hall
chairs
oh
dear
i
wish
it
were
all
coming
over
again
said
tom
leaning
back
and
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
by
the
way
remember
i
owe
you
a
pair
of
gloves
what
color
shall
they
be
any
color
you
like
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
i
felt
so
dreadfully
ashamed
when
they
all
came
up
and
your
mother
looked
so
grave
i
am
sure
she
was
very
angry
poor
mother
she
was
thinking
of
my
hat
with
three
in
it
well
i
am
very
sorry
because
i
wanted
them
to
like
me
and
so
they
will
i
should
like
to
know
who
can
help
it
now
i
wo
have
any
of
your
nonsensical
compliments
do
you
think
they
enjoyed
the
day
yes
i
am
sure
they
did
my
father
said
he
had
never
liked
an
archery
meeting
so
much
but
they
went
away
so
early
they
had
a
very
long
drive
you
know
let
me
see
he
said
feeling
in
his
mother
left
me
a
note
and
i
have
never
looked
at
it
till
now
he
took
a
slip
of
paper
out
and
read
it
and
his
face
fell
what
is
it
said
mary
leaning
forward
oh
nothing
only
i
must
go
morning
there
i
was
sure
she
was
angry
no
no
it
was
written
this
morning
before
she
came
here
i
can
tell
by
the
paper
but
she
will
not
let
you
stay
here
a
day
you
see
i
have
been
here
a
good
deal
considering
all
things
i
should
like
never
to
go
away
perhaps
papa
might
find
a
place
for
you
if
you
asked
him
which
should
you
like
to
be
tutor
to
the
boys
or
gamekeeper
on
the
whole
i
should
prefer
the
tutorship
at
present
you
take
so
much
interest
in
the
boys
yes
because
they
have
no
one
to
look
after
them
now
in
the
holidays
but
when
you
come
as
tutor
i
shall
wash
my
hands
of
them
then
i
shall
decline
the
situation
how
are
you
going
home
i
shall
ride
round
by
englebourn
they
wish
me
to
go
round
and
see
katie
and
uncle
robert
you
talked
about
riding
over
there
yourself
this
morning
i
should
like
it
so
much
but
how
can
we
manage
it
i
ca
ride
back
again
by
myself
could
you
stay
and
sleep
there
i
will
ask
mamma
no
i
afraid
it
can
hardly
be
managed
and
so
saying
mary
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
began
to
pull
to
pieces
some
flowers
she
held
in
her
hand
do
pull
them
to
pieces
give
them
to
me
said
tom
i
have
kept
the
rosebud
you
gave
me
at
oxford
folded
up
in
which
you
took
you
mean
to
say
no
i
wo
give
you
any
of
them
or
let
me
see
yes
here
is
a
sprig
of
lavender
you
may
have
that
thank
you
but
why
lavender
lavender
stands
for
sincerity
it
will
remind
you
of
the
lecture
you
gave
me
i
wish
you
would
forget
that
but
you
know
what
flowers
mean
then
do
give
me
a
lecture
you
owe
me
one
what
do
those
flowers
mean
which
you
will
not
give
me
the
piece
of
heather
for
instance
heather
signifies
constancy
and
the
carnations
jealousy
and
the
heliotrope
oh
never
mind
the
heliotrope
but
it
is
such
a
favorite
of
mine
do
tell
me
what
it
means
vous
said
mary
with
a
laugh
and
a
slight
blush
it
is
all
nonsense
oh
here
mamma
at
last
and
she
jumped
up
and
went
to
meet
her
mother
who
came
out
of
the
candle
in
hand
my
dear
mary
i
thought
you
were
gone
to
bed
said
porter
looking
from
one
to
the
other
seriously
oh
i
not
the
least
tired
and
i
could
go
without
wishing
you
and
papa
good
night
and
thanking
you
for
all
the
trouble
you
have
taken
indeed
we
ought
all
to
thank
you
said
tom
everybody
said
it
was
the
pleasantest
party
they
had
ever
been
at
i
am
very
glad
it
went
off
so
well
said
porter
gravely
and
now
mary
you
must
go
to
bed
i
am
afraid
i
must
leave
you
morning
said
tom
yes
brown
said
they
expect
you
at
home
tomorrow
i
am
to
ride
round
by
uncle
robert
would
you
like
one
of
the
boys
to
go
with
me
oh
dear
mamma
could
not
charley
and
i
ride
over
to
englebourn
i
do
so
long
to
see
katie
no
dear
it
is
much
too
far
for
you
we
will
drive
over
in
a
few
days
time
and
so
saying
porter
wished
tom
good
night
and
led
off
her
daughter
tom
went
slowly
up
stairs
to
his
room
and
after
packing
his
portmanteau
for
the
carrier
to
take
in
the
morning
threw
up
his
window
and
leant
out
into
the
night
and
watched
the
light
clouds
swimming
over
the
moon
and
the
silver
mist
folding
the
and
willows
in
its
soft
cool
mantle
his
thoughts
were
such
as
will
occur
to
any
reader
who
has
passed
the
witching
age
of
twenty
and
the
scent
of
the
in
the
below
seemed
to
rise
very
strongly
on
the
night
air
chapter
xxxii
a
crisis
in
the
forenoon
of
the
following
day
tom
rode
slowly
along
the
street
of
englebourn
towards
the
rectory
gate
he
had
left
barton
soon
after
breakfast
without
having
been
able
to
exchange
a
word
with
mary
except
in
the
presence
of
her
mother
and
yet
he
had
felt
more
anxious
than
ever
before
at
least
to
say
good
bye
to
her
without
witnesses
with
this
view
he
had
been
up
early
and
had
whistled
a
tune
in
the
hall
and
held
a
loud
conversation
with
the
boys
who
appeared
half
dressed
in
the
gallery
above
while
he
brushed
the
dilapidated
white
hat
to
let
all
whom
it
might
concern
know
that
he
was
on
the
move
then
he
had
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
in
full
view
of
the
windows
till
the
bell
rang
for
prayers
he
was
in
the
breakfast
room
before
the
bell
had
done
ringing
and
porter
followed
by
her
daughter
entered
at
the
same
moment
he
could
not
help
fancying
that
the
conversation
at
breakfast
was
a
little
constrained
and
particularly
remarked
that
nothing
was
said
by
the
heads
of
the
family
when
the
boys
vociferously
bewailed
his
approaching
departure
and
tried
to
get
him
to
name
some
day
for
his
return
before
their
holidays
ended
instead
of
encouraging
the
idea
porter
reminded
neddy
and
charley
that
they
had
only
ten
days
more
and
had
not
yet
looked
at
the
work
they
had
to
do
for
their
tutor
in
the
holidays
immediately
after
breakfast
porter
had
wished
him
good
bye
herself
very
kindly
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
without
that
air
of
near
relationship
which
he
had
flattered
himself
was
well
established
between
himself
and
all
the
members
of
the
porter
family
and
then
she
had
added
now
mary
you
must
say
good
bye
i
want
you
to
come
and
help
me
this
morning
he
had
scarcely
looked
at
her
all
morning
and
now
one
shake
of
the
hand
and
she
was
spirited
away
in
a
moment
and
he
was
left
standing
dissatisfied
and
uncomfortable
with
a
sense
of
incompleteness
in
his
mind
and
as
if
he
had
had
a
thread
in
his
life
suddenly
broken
off
which
he
could
not
tell
how
to
get
joined
again
however
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
off
he
had
no
excuse
for
delay
and
had
a
long
ride
before
him
so
he
and
the
boys
went
round
to
the
stable
on
their
passage
through
the
garden
the
idea
of
picking
a
nosegay
and
sending
it
to
her
by
one
of
the
boys
came
into
his
head
he
gathered
the
flowers
but
then
thought
better
of
it
and
threw
them
away
what
right
after
all
had
he
to
be
sending
flowers
to
her
above
all
flowers
to
which
they
had
attached
a
meaning
jokingly
it
was
true
but
still
a
meaning
no
he
had
no
right
to
do
it
it
would
not
be
fair
to
her
or
her
father
or
mother
after
the
kind
way
in
which
they
had
all
received
him
so
he
threw
away
the
flowers
and
mounted
and
rode
off
watched
by
the
boys
who
waved
their
straw
hats
as
he
looked
back
just
before
coming
to
a
turn
in
the
road
which
would
take
him
out
of
sight
of
the
manor
house
he
rode
along
at
a
foot
pace
for
some
time
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
past
week
and
then
beginning
to
feel
purposeless
and
somewhat
melancholy
urged
his
horse
into
a
smart
trot
along
the
waste
land
which
skirted
the
road
but
go
what
pace
he
would
it
mattered
not
he
could
not
leave
his
thoughts
behind
so
he
pulled
up
again
after
a
mile
or
so
slackened
his
reins
and
leaving
his
horse
to
pick
his
own
way
along
the
road
betook
himself
to
the
serious
consideration
of
his
position
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
discontented
he
became
and
the
day
clouded
over
as
if
to
suit
his
temper
he
felt
as
if
within
the
last
hours
he
had
been
somehow
unwarrantably
interfered
with
his
mother
and
porter
had
both
been
planning
something
about
him
he
felt
sure
if
they
had
anything
to
say
why
could
they
say
it
out
to
him
but
what
could
there
be
to
say
could
he
and
mary
be
trusted
together
without
making
fools
of
themselves
he
did
not
stop
to
analyze
his
feelings
towards
her
or
to
consider
whether
it
was
very
prudent
or
desirable
for
her
that
they
should
be
thrown
so
constantly
and
unreservedly
together
he
was
too
much
taken
up
with
what
he
chose
to
consider
his
own
wrongs
for
any
such
why
ca
they
let
me
alone
was
the
question
which
he
asked
himself
perpetually
and
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
reasonable
one
in
the
world
and
that
no
satisfactory
answer
was
possible
to
it
except
that
he
ought
to
be
and
should
be
let
alone
and
so
at
last
he
rode
along
englebourn
street
convinced
that
what
he
had
to
do
before
all
other
things
just
now
was
to
assert
himself
properly
and
show
everyone
even
his
own
mother
that
he
was
no
longer
a
boy
to
be
managed
according
to
fancies
except
his
own
he
rode
straight
to
the
stables
and
loosed
the
girths
of
his
horse
and
gave
particular
directions
about
grooming
and
feeding
him
and
stayed
in
the
stall
for
a
few
minutes
rubbing
his
ears
and
fondling
him
the
antagonism
which
possessed
him
for
the
moment
against
mankind
perhaps
made
him
appreciate
the
value
of
his
relations
with
a
beast
he
had
not
been
in
englebourn
for
some
years
and
the
servant
did
not
know
him
and
answered
that
winter
was
not
out
of
his
room
and
never
saw
strangers
till
the
afternoon
where
was
miss
winter
then
she
was
down
the
village
at
widow
winburn
and
he
could
tell
when
she
would
be
back
the
man
said
the
contents
of
note
of
the
day
before
had
gone
out
of
his
head
but
the
mention
of
betty
name
recalled
them
and
with
them
something
of
the
kindly
feeling
which
had
stirred
within
him
on
hearing
of
her
illness
so
saying
he
would
call
later
to
see
his
uncle
he
started
again
to
find
the
widow
cottage
and
his
cousin
the
servant
had
directed
him
to
the
last
house
in
the
village
but
when
he
got
outside
of
the
gate
there
were
houses
in
two
directions
he
looked
about
for
some
one
and
from
whom
to
inquire
further
and
his
eye
fell
upon
our
old
acquaintance
the
constable
coming
out
of
his
door
with
a
parcel
under
his
arm
the
little
man
was
in
a
brown
study
and
did
not
notice
first
address
he
was
in
fact
anxiously
thinking
over
his
old
friend
illness
and
her
son
trouble
and
was
on
his
way
to
farmer
grove
having
luckily
the
excuse
of
taking
a
coat
to
be
tried
on
in
the
hopes
of
getting
him
to
interfere
and
patch
up
the
quarrel
between
young
tester
and
harry
tom
first
salute
had
been
friendly
enough
no
one
knew
better
how
to
speak
to
the
poor
amongst
whom
he
had
lived
all
his
life
than
he
but
not
getting
any
answer
and
being
in
a
touchy
state
of
mind
he
was
put
out
and
shouted
hello
my
man
ca
you
hear
me
ees
i
beant
dunch
replied
the
constable
turning
and
looking
at
his
questioner
i
thought
you
were
for
i
spoke
loud
enough
before
which
is
winburn
cottage
the
furdest
house
down
ther
he
said
pointing
is
in
my
way
if
you
a
mind
to
come
tom
accepted
the
offer
and
walked
along
by
the
constable
winburn
is
ill
is
she
he
asked
after
looking
his
guide
over
ees
her
be
terrible
bad
said
the
constable
what
is
the
matter
with
her
do
you
know
zummat
o
fits
i
hears
her
had
this
six
year
on
and
off
i
suppose
it
dangerous
i
mean
she
is
likely
to
get
well
is
in
the
lord
hands
replied
the
constable
but
that
bad
wi
pain
at
times
be
a
mussy
if
plaase
he
to
tak
her
out
o
perhaps
she
might
think
so
said
tom
superciliously
he
was
not
in
the
mind
to
agree
with
anyone
the
constable
looked
at
him
solemnly
for
a
moment
and
then
said
her
been
a
woman
from
her
youth
up
and
her
had
a
deal
o
trouble
thaay
as
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
and
such
as
thaay
as
is
afeared
to
go
afore
him
well
i
never
found
that
having
troubles
made
people
a
bit
more
anxious
to
get
o
as
you
call
it
said
tom
it
seem
to
me
as
you
can
had
much
o
trouble
to
judge
by
said
the
constable
who
was
beginning
to
be
nettled
by
tom
manner
how
can
you
tell
that
leastways
be
then
persisted
the
constable
and
ther
a
sight
o
odds
atween
whoam
made
troubles
and
thaay
as
the
lord
sends
so
there
may
but
i
may
have
seen
both
sorts
for
anything
you
can
tell
nay
nay
the
lord
troubles
leaves
his
marks
and
you
do
see
any
of
in
my
face
eh
the
constable
jerked
his
head
after
his
own
peculiar
fashion
but
declined
to
reply
directly
to
this
interrogatory
he
parried
it
by
one
of
his
own
in
the
doctorin
line
make
so
bould
no
said
tom
you
do
seem
to
have
such
very
good
eyes
after
all
oh
i
seed
you
was
old
enough
to
be
doin
for
yourself
like
but
i
thought
you
med
ha
been
a
or
summat
well
then
you
just
mistaken
said
tom
considerably
disgusted
at
being
taken
for
a
country
doctor
assistant
i
ax
your
said
the
constable
but
if
you
beant
in
the
doctorin
line
what
be
gwine
to
widow
winburn
for
make
so
bould
that
my
look
out
i
suppose
said
tom
almost
angrily
that
the
house
is
it
and
he
pointed
to
the
cottage
already
described
at
the
corner
of
englebourn
copse
ees
good
day
then
good
day
muttered
the
constable
not
at
all
satisfied
with
this
abrupt
close
of
the
conversation
but
too
unready
to
prolong
it
he
went
on
his
own
way
slowly
looking
back
often
till
he
saw
the
door
open
after
which
he
seemed
better
satisfied
and
ambled
out
of
sight
the
old
snuffler
thought
tom
as
be
strode
up
to
the
cottage
door
a
ranter
i
be
bound
with
his
lord
troubles
and
hands
and
marks
i
hope
uncle
robert
many
such
in
the
parish
he
knocked
at
the
cottage
door
and
in
a
few
seconds
it
opened
gently
and
katie
slipped
out
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
she
made
a
slight
gesture
of
surprise
at
seeing
him
and
held
out
her
hand
hush
she
said
she
is
asleep
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
no
not
particularly
he
answered
abruptly
for
there
was
something
in
her
voice
and
manner
which
jarred
with
his
humor
hush
she
said
again
you
must
not
speak
so
loud
we
can
sit
down
here
and
talk
quietly
i
shall
hear
if
she
moves
so
he
sat
down
opposite
to
her
in
the
little
porch
of
the
cottage
she
left
the
door
ajar
so
that
she
might
catch
the
least
movement
of
her
patient
and
then
turned
to
him
with
a
bright
smile
and
said
well
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
what
good
wind
blows
you
here
no
particularly
good
wind
that
i
know
of
mary
showed
me
your
letter
yesterday
and
mother
wished
me
to
come
round
here
on
my
way
home
and
so
here
i
am
and
how
did
the
party
go
off
i
long
to
hear
about
it
very
well
half
the
county
were
there
and
it
was
all
very
well
done
and
how
did
dear
mary
look
oh
just
as
usual
but
now
katie
why
did
you
come
mary
and
all
of
us
were
so
disappointed
i
thought
you
read
my
letter
yes
so
i
did
then
you
know
the
reason
i
do
call
it
a
reason
really
you
have
no
right
to
shut
yourself
up
from
everything
you
will
be
getting
moped
to
death
but
do
i
look
moped
she
said
and
he
looked
at
her
and
could
help
admitting
to
himself
reluctantly
that
she
did
not
so
he
fire
from
another
point
you
will
wear
yourself
out
nursing
every
old
woman
in
the
parish
but
i
do
nurse
every
old
woman
why
there
is
no
one
here
but
you
now
he
said
with
a
motion
of
his
head
towards
the
cottage
no
because
i
have
let
the
regular
nurse
go
home
for
a
few
hours
besides
this
is
a
special
case
you
do
know
what
a
dear
old
soul
betty
is
yes
i
do
i
remember
her
ever
since
i
was
a
child
ah
i
forgot
i
have
often
heart
her
talk
of
you
then
you
ought
not
to
be
surprised
at
anything
i
may
do
for
her
she
is
a
good
kind
old
woman
i
know
but
still
i
must
say
katie
you
ought
to
think
of
your
friends
and
relations
a
little
and
what
you
owe
to
society
indeed
i
do
think
of
my
friends
and
relations
very
much
and
i
should
have
liked
of
all
things
to
have
been
with
you
yesterday
you
ought
to
be
pitying
me
instead
of
scolding
me
my
dear
katie
you
know
i
did
mean
to
scold
you
and
nobody
admires
the
way
you
give
yourself
up
to
visiting
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
more
than
i
only
you
ought
to
have
a
little
pleasure
sometimes
people
have
a
right
to
think
of
themselves
and
their
own
happiness
a
little
perhaps
i
do
find
visiting
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
so
very
miserable
but
now
tom
you
saw
in
my
letter
that
poor
son
has
got
into
trouble
yes
and
that
is
what
brought
on
her
attack
you
said
i
believe
so
she
was
in
a
sad
state
about
him
all
yesterday
so
painfully
eager
and
anxious
she
is
better
today
but
still
i
think
it
would
do
her
good
if
you
would
see
her
and
say
you
will
be
a
friend
to
her
son
would
you
mind
it
was
just
what
i
wished
to
do
yesterday
i
will
do
all
i
can
for
him
i
sure
i
always
liked
him
as
a
boy
you
can
tell
her
that
but
i
do
feel
somehow
today
at
least
as
if
i
could
do
any
good
by
seeing
her
oh
why
not
i
do
think
i
in
the
right
humor
is
she
very
ill
yes
very
ill
indeed
i
do
think
she
can
recover
well
you
see
katie
i
not
used
to
i
say
the
right
sort
of
thing
how
do
you
mean
the
right
sort
of
thing
oh
you
know
i
could
talk
to
her
about
her
soul
i
not
fit
for
it
and
it
is
my
place
no
indeed
it
is
but
you
can
remind
her
of
old
times
and
say
a
kind
word
about
her
son
very
well
if
you
do
think
i
shall
do
any
harm
i
sure
it
will
comfort
her
and
now
tell
me
about
yesterday
they
sat
talking
for
some
time
in
the
same
low
tone
and
tom
began
to
forget
his
causes
of
quarrel
with
the
world
and
gave
an
account
of
the
archery
party
from
his
own
point
of
view
katie
saw
with
a
woman
quickness
that
he
avoided
mentioning
mary
and
smiled
to
herself
and
drew
her
own
conclusions
at
last
there
was
a
slight
movement
in
the
cottage
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
she
got
up
quickly
and
went
in
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
to
the
door
again
how
is
she
asked
tom
oh
much
the
same
but
she
has
waked
without
pain
which
is
a
great
blessing
now
are
you
ready
yes
you
must
go
with
me
come
in
then
she
turned
and
he
followed
into
the
cottage
betty
bed
had
been
moved
into
the
kitchen
for
the
sake
of
light
and
air
he
glanced
at
the
corner
where
it
stood
with
almost
a
feeling
of
awe
as
he
followed
his
cousin
on
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
recognize
the
pale
drawn
face
which
lay
on
the
coarse
pillow
the
rush
of
old
memories
which
the
sight
called
up
and
the
thought
of
the
suffering
of
his
poor
old
friend
touched
him
deeply
katie
went
to
the
and
stooping
down
smoothed
the
pillow
and
placed
her
hand
for
a
moment
on
the
forehead
of
her
patient
then
she
looked
up
and
beckoned
to
him
and
said
in
her
low
clear
voice
betty
here
is
an
old
friend
come
to
see
you
my
cousin
squire
brown
son
you
remember
him
quite
a
little
boy
the
old
woman
moved
her
head
towards
the
voice
and
smiled
but
gave
no
further
sign
of
recognition
tom
stole
across
the
floor
and
sat
down
by
the
oh
yes
betty
he
said
leaning
towards
her
and
speaking
softly
you
must
remember
me
master
tom
who
used
to
come
to
your
cottage
on
baking
days
for
hot
bread

tom
taking

the
skin
all
puckered
from
long
and
daily
acquaintance
with
the
i

lustreless
eyes

lord
bless

master
tom
for
that
word
said
the
dying
woman
returning
the
pressure
as
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
katie
who
had
been
watching
her
carefully
from
the
other
side
of
the
bed
made
him
a
sign
to
go
betty
he
said
i
wo
forget
you
may
be
sure
god
bless
you
and
then
disengaging
his
hand
gently
went
out
again
into
the
porch
where
he
sat
down
to
wait
for
his
cousin
in
a
few
minutes
the
nurse
returned
and
katie
came
out
of
the
cottage
soon
afterwards
now
i
will
walk
up
home
with
you
she
said
you
must
come
in
and
see
papa
well
i
sure
you
must
be
glad
you
went
in
was
not
i
right
yes
indeed
i
wish
i
could
have
said
something
more
to
comfort
her
you
could
have
said
more
it
was
just
what
she
wanted
but
where
is
her
son
i
ought
to
see
him
before
i
go
he
has
gone
to
the
doctor
for
some
medicine
he
will
be
back
soon
well
i
must
see
him
and
i
should
like
to
do
something
for
him
at
once
i
not
very
flush
of
money
but
i
must
give
you
something
for
him
you
take
it
i
should
like
to
offer
it
to
him
i
hardly
think
he
wants
money
they
are
well
off
now
he
earns
good
wages
and
betty
has
done
her
washing
up
to
this
week
yes
but
he
will
be
fined
i
suppose
for
this
assault
and
then
if
she
should
die
there
will
be
the
funeral
expenses
very
well
as
you
please
she
said
and
tom
proceeded
to
hand
over
to
her
all
his
ready
money
except
a
shilling
or
two
after
satisfying
his
mind
thus
he
looked
at
her
and
said
do
you
know
katie
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
you
so
happy
and
in
such
spirits
there
now
and
yet
you
began
talking
to
me
as
if
i
were
looking
sad
enough
to
turn
all
the
beer
in
the
parish
sour
well
so
you
ought
to
be
according
to
cocker
spending
all
your
time
in
sick
rooms
according
to
who
according
to
cocker
who
is
cocker
oh
i
do
know
some
old
fellow
who
wrote
the
rules
of
arithmetic
i
believe
it
only
a
bit
of
slang
but
i
repeat
you
have
a
right
to
be
sad
and
it
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
your
relations
to
look
as
pleasant
as
you
do
katie
laughed
you
ought
not
to
say
so
at
any
rate
she
said
for
you
look
all
the
pleasanter
for
your
visit
to
a
sick
room
did
i
look
very
unpleasant
before
well
i
do
think
you
were
in
a
very
good
humor
no
i
was
in
a
very
bad
humor
and
talking
to
you
and
poor
old
betty
has
set
me
right
i
think
but
you
said
hers
was
a
special
case
it
must
be
very
sad
work
in
general
only
when
one
sees
people
in
great
pain
or
when
they
are
wicked
and
quarreling
or
complaining
about
nothing
then
i
do
get
very
low
sometimes
but
even
then
it
is
much
better
than
keeping
to
one
self
anything
is
better
than
thinking
of
self
and
one
own
troubles
i
dare
say
you
are
right
said
tom
recalling
his
meditations
especially
when
one
troubles
are
homemade
look
here
an
old
fellow
who
gave
me
a
lecture
on
that
subject
before
i
saw
you
this
morning
and
took
me
for
the
apothecary
boy
they
were
almost
opposite
david
door
at
which
he
stood
with
a
piece
of
work
in
his
hand
he
had
seen
miss
winter
from
his
window
and
had
descended
from
his
board
in
hopes
of
hearing
news
katie
returned
his
respectful
and
anxious
salute
and
said
she
is
no
worse
david
we
left
her
quite
out
of
pain
and
very
quiet
ah
is
to
be
hoped
as
she
hev
a
peaceful
time
o
now
poor
soul
said
david
i
a
been
to

she

to
tom

than

to
keep

right
david
seemed
a
little
embarrassed
and
began
jerking
his
head
about
when
his
acquaintance
of
the
morning
whom
he
had
scarcely
noticed
before
was
introduced
by
miss
winter
as
my

tom
and

very
glad

he
took
out
a

and
handed
it

looked
at
it
and
then
said

that

david
then
said
tom
holding
out
his
hand
and
mind
you
let
me
hear
from
you
what
a
queer
old
bird
with
his
whole
wisdom
of
man
packed
up
small
for
ready
use
like
a
quack
doctor
he
said
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
indeed
he
is
the
least
like
a
quack
doctor
i
do
know
a
better
man
in
the
parish
though
he
is
rather
obstinate
like
all
the
rest
of
them
i
did
mean
to
say
anything
against
him
i
assure
you
said
tom
on
the
contrary
i
think
him
a
fine
old
fellow
but
i
did
think
so
this
morning
when
he
showed
me
the
way
to
betty
cottage
the
fact
was
that
tom
saw
all
things
and
persons
with
quite
a
different
pair
of
eyes
from
those
which
he
had
been
provided
with
when
he
arrived
in
englebourn
that
morning
he
even
made
allowances
for
old
winter
who
was
in
his
usual
querulous
state
at
luncheon
though
perhaps
it
would
have
been
difficult
in
the
whole
neighborhood
to
find
a
more
pertinent
comment
on
and
illustration
of
the
constable
text
than
the
poor
old
man
furnished
with
his
complaints
about
his
own
health
and
all
he
had
to
do
and
think
of
for
everybody
about
him
it
did
strike
tom
however
as
very
wonderful
how
such
a
character
as
katie
could
have
grown
up
under
the
shade
of
and
in
constant
contact
with
such
a
one
as
her
father
he
wished
his
uncle
soon
after
luncheon
and
he
and
katie
started
again
down
the
village
she
to
return
to
her
nursing
and
he
on
his
way
home
he
led
his
horse
by
the
bridle
and
walked
by
her
side
down
the
street
she
pointed
to
the
hawk
lynch
as
they
walked
along
and
said
you
should
ride
up
there
it
is
scarcely
out
of
your
way
mary
and
i
used
to
walk
there
every
day
when
she
was
here
and
she
was
so
fond
of
it
at
the
cottage
they
found
harry
winburn
he
came
out
and
the
two
young
men
shook
hands
and
looked
one
another
over
and
exchanged
a
few
shy
sentences
tom
managed
with
difficulty
to
say
the
little
he
had
to
say
but
tried
to
make
up
for
it
by
a
hearty
manner
it
was
not
the
time
or
place
for
any
unnecessary
talk
so
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
mounted
and
riding
up
the
slope
towards
the
heath
i
should
say
he
must
be
half
a
stone
lighter
than
i
he
thought
and
not
quite
so
tall
but
he
looks
as
hard
as
iron
and
tough
as
whipcord
what
a
no
he
make
in
a
heavy
crew
poor
fellow
he
seems
dreadfully
cut
up
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
be
of
use
to
him
now
for
this
place
which
katie
showed
me
from
the
village
street
he
pressed
his
horse
up
the
steep
side
of
the
hawk
lynch
the
exhilaration
of
the
scramble
and
the
sense
of
power
and
of
some
slight
risk
which
he
felt
as
he
helped
on
the
gallant
beast
with
hand
and
knee
and
heel
while
the
loose
turf
and
stones
flew
from
his
hoofs
and
rolled
down
the
hill
behind
them
made
tom
eyes
kindle
and
his
pulse
beat
quicker
as
he
reached
the
top
and
pulled
up
under
the
scotch
firs
this
was
her
favorite
walk
then
no
wonder
what
an
air
and
what
a
view
he
jumped
off
his
horse
slipped
the
bridle
over
his
arm
and
let
him
pick
away
at
the
short
grass
and
tufts
of
heath
as
he
himself
first
stood
and
then
sat
and
looked
out
over
the
scene
which
she
had
so
often
looked
over
she
might
have
sat
on
the
very
spot
he
was
sitting
on
she
must
have
taken
in
the
same
expanse
of
wood
and
meadow
village
and
park
and
dreamy
distant
hill
her
presence
seemed
to
fill
the
air
round
him
a
rush
of
new
thoughts
and
feelings
swam
through
his
brain
and
carried
him
a
willing
piece
of
drift
man
along
with
them
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
stream
and
revelled
in
them
his
eye
traced
back
the
road
along
which
he
had
ridden
in
the
morning
and
rested
on
the
barton
woods
just
visible
in
the
distance
on
this
side
of
the
point
where
all
outline
except
that
of
the
horizon
began
to
be
lost
the
flickering
july
air
seemed
to
beat
in
a
pulse
of
purple
glory
over
the
spot
the
soft
wind
which
blew
straight
from
barton
seemed
laden
with
her
name
and
whispered
it
in
the
firs
over
his
head
every
nerve
in
his
body
was
bounding
with
new
life
and
he
could
sit
still
no
longer
he
rose
sprang
on
his
horse
and
with
a
shout
of
joy
turned
from
the
vale
and
rushed
away
on
to
the
heath
northwards
towards
his
home
behind
the
chalk
hills
he
had
ridden
into
englebourn
in
the
morning
an
almost
unconscious
dabbler
by
the
margin
of
the
great
stream
he
rode
from
the
hawk
lynch
in
the
afternoon
over
head
and
ears
and
twenty
a
hundred
ay
unnumbered
fathoms
below
that
deep
consciously
and
triumphantly
in
love
but
at
what
a
pace
and
in
what
a
form
love
at
least
in
his
first
access
must
be
as
blind
a
horseman
as
he
is
an
archer
the
heath
was
rough
with
and
and
many
a
farm
road
and
tufts
of
heather
and
furze
over
them
and
through
them
went
horse
and
man
horse
rising
seven
and
man
twenty
off
a
pair
in
age
for
a
wild
ride
headlong
towards
the
north
till
a
blind
rut
somewhat
deeper
than
usual
put
an
end
to
their
career
and
sent
the
good
horse
staggering
forward
some
thirty
feet
on
to
his
nose
and
knees
and
tom
over
his
shoulder
on
to
his
back
in
the
heather
well
it
lucky
it
no
worse
thought
our
hero
as
he
picked
himself
up
and
anxiously
examined
the
horse
who
stood
trembling
and
looking
wildly
puzzled
at
the
whole
proceeding
i
hope
he
has
overreached
what
will
the
governor
say
his
knees
are
all
right
poor
old
boy
he
said
patting
him
no
wonder
you
look
astonished
you
not
in
love
come
along
we
wo
make
fools
of
ourselves
any
more
what
is
it
true
love
forsaken
a
new
love
may
get
but
a
neck
that
once
broken
can
never
be
set
what
stuff
one
may
get
a
neck
set
for
anything
i
know
but
a
new
love
blasphemy
the
rest
of
the
ride
passed
off
soberly
enough
except
in
brain
wherein
were
built
up
in
gorgeous
succession
castles
such
as
we
have
all
built
i
suppose
before
now
and
with
the
castles
were
built
up
side
by
side
good
honest
resolves
to
be
worthy
of
her
and
win
her
and
worship
her
with
body
and
mind
and
soul
and
as
a
first
installment
away
to
the
winds
went
all
the
selfish
morning
thoughts
and
he
rode
down
the
northern
slope
of
the
chalk
hills
a
dutiful
and
affectionate
son
at
peace
with
porter
honoring
her
for
her
care
of
the
treasure
which
he
was
seeking
and
in
good
time
for
dinner
well
dear
said
brown
to
her
husband
when
they
were
alone
that
night
did
you
ever
see
tom
in
such
spirits
and
so
gentle
and
affectionate
dear
boy
there
can
be
nothing
the
matter
did
i
tell
you
so
replied
brown
you
women
have
always
got
some
nonsense
in
your
heads
as
soon
as
your
boys
have
a
hair
on
their
chin
or
your
girls
begin
to
put
up
their
back
hair
well
john
say
what
you
will
i
sure
mary
porter
is
a
very
sweet
taking
girl
and
i
am
quite
of
the
same
opinion
said
brown
and
am
very
glad
you
have
written
to
ask
them
here
and
so
the
worthy
couple
went
happily
to
bed
chapter
xxxiii
brown
patronus
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
august
a
few
weeks
after
the
eventful
ride
tom
returned
to
the
englebourn
rectory
to
stay
over
sunday
and
attend
betty
winburn
funeral
he
was
strangely
attracted
to
harry
by
the
remembrance
of
their
old
boyish
rivalry
by
the
story
which
he
had
heard
from
his
cousin
of
the
unwavering
perseverance
with
which
the
young
peasant
clung
to
and
pursued
his
suit
for
simon
daughter
but
more
than
all
by
the
feeling
of
gratitude
with
which
he
remembered
the
effect
his
visit
to
betty
sick
room
had
had
on
him
on
the
day
of
his
ride
from
barton
manor
on
that
day
he
knew
that
he
had
ridden
into
englebourn
in
a
miserable
mental
fog
and
had
ridden
out
of
it
in
sunshine
which
had
lasted
through
the
intervening
weeks
somehow
or
another
he
had
been
set
straight
then
and
there
turned
into
the
right
road
and
out
of
the
wrong
one
at
what
he
very
naturally
believed
to
be
the
most
critical
moment
of
his
life
without
stopping
to
weigh
accurately
the
respective
merits
of
the
several
persons
whom
he
came
in
contact
with
that
day
he
credited
them
all
with
a
large
amount
of
gratitude
and
and
harry
with
his
mother
share
as
well
as
his
own
so
he
had
been
longing
to
something
for
him
ever
since
the
more
he
rejoiced
in
and
gave
himself
up
to
his
own
new
sensations
the
more
did
his
gratitude
become
as
it
were
a
burden
to
him
and
yet
no
opportunity
offered
of
letting
off
some
of
it
in
action
the
magistrates
taking
into
consideration
the
dangerous
state
of
his
mother
had
let
harry
off
with
a
reprimand
for
his
assault
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
there
he
wrote
to
katie
offering
more
money
for
the
winburns
but
she
declined
adding
however
to
her
note
by
way
of
postscript
that
he
might
give
it
to
her
clothing
club
or
coal
club
then
came
the
news
of
betty
death
and
an
intimation
from
katie
that
she
thought
harry
would
be
much
gratified
if
he
would
attend
the
funeral
he
jumped
at
the
suggestion
all
englebourn
from
the
hawk
lynch
to
the
rectory
was
hallowed
ground
to
him
the
idea
of
getting
back
there
so
much
nearer
to
barton
manor
filled
him
with
joy
which
he
tried
in
vain
to
repress
when
he
thought
of
the
main
object
of
his
visit
on
the
present
occasion
he
arrived
in
time
to
go
and
shake
hands
with
harry
before
dinner
and
though
scarcely
a
word
passed
between
them
he
saw
with
delight
that
he
had
evidently
given
pleasure
to
the
mourner
then
he
had
a
charming
long
evening
with
katie
walking
in
the
garden
with
her
between
dinner
and
tea
and
after
tea
discoursing
in
low
tones
over
her
while
winter
benevolently
slept
in
his
their
discourse
branched
into
many
paths
but
managed
always
somehow
to
end
in
the
sayings
beliefs
and
perfections
of
the
young
lady
of
barton
manor
tom
wondered
how
it
had
happened
so
when
he
got
to
his
own
room
as
he
fancied
he
had
not
betrayed
himself
in
the
least
he
had
determined
to
keep
resolutely
on
his
guard
and
to
make
a
confident
of
no
living
soul
till
he
was
and
though
sorely
tempted
to
break
his
resolution
in
favor
of
katie
had
restrained
himself
he
might
have
spared
himself
all
the
trouble
but
this
he
did
not
know
being
unversed
in
the
ways
of
women
and
all
unaware
of
the
subtlety
and
quickness
of
their
intuitions
in
all
matters
connected
with
the
heart
poor
dear
stolid
mankind
how
they
do
see
through
us
and
walk
round
us
the
funeral
on
the
sunday
afternoon
between
churches
had
touched
him
much
being
the
first
he
had
ever
attended
he
walked
next
behind
the
chief
mourner
the
few
friends
amongst
whom
david
was
conspicuous
yielding
place
to
him
he
stood
beside
harry
in
church
and
at
the
open
grave
and
made
the
responses
as
firmly
as
he
could
and
pressed
his
shoulder
against
his
when
he
felt
the
strong
frame
of
the
son
trembling
with
the
weight
and
burden
of
his
resolutely
suppressed
agony
when
they
parted
at
the
cottage
door
to
which
tom
accompanied
the
mourner
and
his
old
and
tried
friend
david
though
nothing
but
a
look
and
a
grasp
of
the
hand
passed
between
them
he
felt
that
they
were
bound
by
a
new
and
invisible
bond
and
as
he
walked
back
up
the
village
and
passed
the
churchyard
where
the
children
were
playing
about
on
the
graves
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
watch
the
sexton
as
he
stamped
down
and
filled
in
the
mould
on
the
last
made
one
beside
which
he
himself
stood
as
a
mourner
and
heard
the
bells
beginning
to
chime
for
the
afternoon
service
he
resolved
within
himself
that
he
would
be
a
true
and
helpful
friend
to
the
son
on
this
subject
he
could
talk
freely
to
katie
and
he
did
so
that
evening
expounding
how
much
one
in
his
position
could
do
for
a
young
laboring
man
if
he
was
really
bent
on
it
and
building
up
grand
castles
for
harry
the
foundations
of
which
rested
on
his
own
determination
to
benefit
and
patronize
him
katie
listened
half
doubtingly
at
first
but
was
soon
led
away
by
his
confidence
and
poured
out
the
tea
in
the
full
belief
that
with
tom
powerful
aid
all
would
go
well
after
which
they
took
to
reading
the
christian
year
together
and
branched
into
discussions
on
profane
poetry
which
katie
considered
scarcely
proper
for
the
evening
but
which
nevertheless
being
of
such
rare
occurrence
with
her
she
had
not
the
heart
to
stop
the
next
morning
tom
was
to
return
home
after
breakfast
he
began
the
subject
of
his
future
plans
for
harry
again
when
katie
produced
a
small
paper
packet
which
she
handed
to
him
saying
here
is
your
money
again
what
money
the
money
you
left
with
me
for
harry
winburn
i
thought
at
the
time
that
most
probably
he
would
not
take
it
but
are
you
sure
he
does
want
it
did
you
try
hard
to
get
him
to
take
it
said
tom
holding
out
his
hand
reluctantly
for
the
money
not
myself
i
could
offer
him
money
myself
of
course
but
i
sent
it
by
david
and
begged
him
to
do
all
he
could
to
persuade
him
to
take
it
well
and
why
would
he
oh
he
said
the
which
was
coming
in
was
more
than
enough
to
pay
for
the
funeral
and
for
himself
he
did
want
it
how
provoking
i
wonder
if
old
david
really
did
his
best
to
get
him
to
take
it
yes
i
am
sure
he
did
but
you
ought
to
be
very
glad
to
find
some
independence
in
a
poor
man
bother
his
independence
i
do
like
to
feel
that
it
costs
me
nothing
but
talk
i
want
to
pay
ah
tom
if
you
knew
the
poor
as
well
as
i
do
you
would
say
so
i
am
afraid
there
are
not
two
other
men
in
the
parish
who
would
have
refused
your
money
the
fear
of
undermining
their
independence
takes
away
all
my
pleasure
in
giving
undermining
why
katie
i
am
sure
i
have
heard
you
mourn
over
their
stubbornness
and
unreasonableness
oh
yes
they
are
often
provokingly
stubborn
and
unreasonable
and
yet
not
independent
about
money
or
anything
they
can
get
out
of
you
besides
i
acknowledge
that
i
have
become
wiser
of
late
i
used
to
like
to
see
them
dependent
and
cringing
to
me
but
now
i
dread
it
but
you
would
like
david
to
give
in
about
the
singing
you
yes
if
he
would
give
in
i
should
be
very
proud
i
have
learnt
a
great
deal
from
him
i
used
positively
to
dislike
him
but
now
that
i
know
him
i
think
him
the
best
man
in
the
parish
if
he
ever
does
give
in
and
i
think
he
will
it
will
be
worth
anything
just
because
he
is
so
independent
that
all
very
well
but
what
am
i
to
do
to
show
harry
winburn
that
i
mean
to
be
his
friend
if
he
wo
take
money
from
me
you
have
come
over
to
his
mother
funeral
he
will
think
more
of
that
than
of
all
the
money
you
could
give
him
and
you
can
show
sympathy
for
him
in
a
great
many
ways
well
i
must
try
by
the
way
about
his
love
affair
is
the
young
lady
at
home
i
have
never
seen
her
you
know
no
she
is
away
with
an
aunt
looking
out
for
a
place
i
have
persuaded
her
to
get
one
and
leave
home
again
for
the
present
her
father
is
quite
well
now
and
she
is
not
wanted
well
it
seems
i
ca
do
any
good
with
her
then
but
could
i
not
go
and
talk
to
her
father
about
harry
i
might
help
him
in
that
way
you
must
be
very
careful
simon
is
such
an
old
man
oh
i
not
afraid
he
and
i
are
great
chums
and
a
little
soft
soap
will
go
a
long
way
with
him
fancy
if
i
could
get
him
this
very
morning
to
harry
suit
as
the
phrase
is
what
should
you
think
of
me
i
should
think
very
highly
of
your
powers
of
persuasion
not
the
least
daunted
by
his
cousin
misgivings
tom
started
in
quest
of
simon
and
found
him
at
work
in
front
of
the
greenhouse
surrounded
by
many
small
pots
and
heaps
of
finely
sifted
mould
and
absorbed
in
his
occupation
simon
was
a
rough
stolid
berkshire
rustic
somewhat
of
a
tyrant
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
an
unmanageable
servant
a
acquaintance
as
a
citizen
and
a
grumbler
who
thought
that
nothing
ever
went
right
in
the
parish
but
withal
a
thoroughly
honest
worker
and
when
allowed
to
go
his
own
way
and
no
other
way
would
he
go
as
his
mistress
had
long
since
discovered
there
was
no
man
who
earned
his
daily
bread
more
honestly
he
took
a
pride
in
his
work
and
the
rectory
garden
was
always
trim
and
well
kept
and
the
beds
bright
with
flowers
from
early
spring
till
late
autumn
he
was
absorbed
in
what
he
was
about
and
tom
came
up
close
to
him
without
attracting
the
least
sign
of
recognition
so
he
stopped
and
opened
the
conversation
good
day
simon
it
a
pleasure
to
see
a
garden
looking
so
gay
as
yours
simon
looked
up
from
his
work
and
when
he
saw
who
it
was
touched
his
battered
old
hat
and
answered
mornin
sir
ees
you
finds
me
allus
in
blume
indeed
i
do
simon
but
how
do
you
manage
it
i
should
like
to
tell
my
father
gardener
is
no
use
to
tell
un
if
a
have
found
out
for
hisself
is
nothing
but
lookin
a
bit
forrard
and
stuff
as
does
it
well
there
plenty
of
stuff
at
home
and
yet
somehow
we
never
look
half
so
bright
as
you
do
may
be
as
your
gardener
just
takes
and
hits
it
auver
the
top
the
ground
and
lets
it
lie
that
no
kind
o
good
that
beant
is
the
roots
as
wants
the
stuff
and
you
med
jist
as
well
take
and
put
a
round
o
beef
agin
my
back
bwone
as
hit
the
stuff
auver
the
ground
and
never
see
as
it
gets
to
the
roots
the
plants
no
i
do
think
it
can
be
that
said
tom
laughing
our
gardener
seems
always
to
be
digging
his
manure
in
but
somehow
he
ca
make
it
come
out
in
flowers
as
you
do
ther
be
mwore
waays
o
killin
a
cat
besides
choking
on
un
crame
said
simon
chuckling
in
his
turn
that
true
simon
said
tom
the
fact
is
a
gardener
must
know
his
business
as
well
as
you
to
be
always
in
bloom
eh
that
about
it
sir
said
simon
on
whom
the
flattery
was
beginning
to
tell
tom
saw
this
and
thought
he
might
now
feel
his
way
a
little
further
with
the
old
man
i
over
on
a
sad
errand
he
said
i
been
to
poor
widow
winburn
funeral
she
was
an
old
friend
of
yours
i
think
ees
i
minds
her
long
afore
she
wur
married
said
simon
turning
to
his
pots
again
she
was
an
old
woman
after
all
said
tom
year
old
cum
michaelmas
said
simon
well
she
ought
to
have
been
a
strong
woman
for
another
ten
years
at
least
why
you
must
be
older
than
she
by
some
years
simon
and
you
can
do
a
good
day
work
yet
with
any
man
simon
went
on
with
his
potting
without
replying
except
by
a
carefully
measured
grunt
sufficient
to
show
that
he
had
heard
the
remark
and
was
not
much
impressed
by
it
tom
saw
that
he
must
change
his
attack
so
after
watching
simon
for
a
minute
he
began
again
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
the
men
of
your
time
of
life
are
so
much
stronger
than
the
young
ones
in
constitution
now
i
believe
there
are
three
young
men
in
englebourn
who
would
have
got
over
that
fall
you
had
at
farmer
groves
so
quick
as
you
have
most
young
men
would
have
been
crippled
for
life
by
it
zo
would
the
young
wosbirds
i
dwont
make
no
account
on
said
simon
and
you
do
feel
any
the
worse
for
it
simon
narra
mossel
replied
simon
but
presently
he
seemed
to
recollect
something
and
added
i
wu
saay
but
what
i
feels
it
at
times
when
i
got
to
stoop
about
much
ah
i
sorry
to
hear
that
simon
then
you
ought
to
have
so
much
stooping
to
do
potting
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
the
work
for
you
i
should
think
and
just
giving
an
eye
to
everything
about
the
place
anybody
could
do
the
digging
and
setting
out
cabbages
and
your
time
is
only
wasted
at
it
tom
had
now
found
the
old
man
weak
point
ees
sir
and
so
i
tells
miss
he
said
but
wi
nothin
but
a
bit
o
glass
no
a
cowcumber
frame
is
all
as
a
man
can
do
to
keep
a
few
plants
alive
droo
the
winter
of
course
said
tom
looking
round
at
the
very
respectable
greenhouse
which
simon
had
contemptuously
likened
to
a
you
ought
to
have
at
least
another
house
as
big
as
this
for
forcing
master
ai
pleased
he
ai
said
simon
if
he
dwo
get
his
things
his
spring
wegetables
and
his
strawberries
as
early
as
though
we
a
got
forcin
pits
and
glass
like
other
folk
is
a
year
and
mwore
since
he
promised
as
i
sh
hev
glass
along
that
ther
wall
but
is
no
nigher
comin
as
i
can
see
i
be
to
spake
to
miss
about
it
now
and
when
i
spakes
to
her
is
simon
we
must
wait
till
the
or
simon
last
winter
wur
a
werry
tryin
wun
and
the
sick
terrible
bad
off
for
funds
and
so
we
gwoes
on
and
med
gwo
on
for
aught
as
i
can
see
so
long
as
there
a
body
sick
or
bad
off
in
all
the
parish
and
that
be
all
us
for
what
wi
on
and
sendin
on
dinners
and
the
doctor
stuff
as
is
served
out
o
the
wy
is
enough
to
keep
bad
ther
lives
ther
ai
no
credit
in
gettin
well
wur
no
sich
a
caddle
about
sick
folk
when
i
wur
a
bwoy
simon
had
never
been
known
to
make
such
a
long
speech
before
and
tom
argued
well
for
his
negotiation
well
simon
he
said
i
been
talking
to
my
cousin
and
i
think
she
will
do
what
you
want
now
the
dispensary
is
set
up
and
the
people
are
very
healthy
how
much
glass
should
you
want
now
along
that
wall
a
matter
o
twenty
fit
or
so
said
simon
i
think
that
can
be
managed
said
tom
i
speak
to
my
cousin
about
it
and
then
you
would
have
plenty
to
do
in
the
houses
and
you
want
a
regular
man
under
you
ees
take
two
on
us
to
kep
things
as
they
should
be
and
you
ought
to
have
somebody
who
knows
what
he
is
about
can
you
think
of
anyone
who
would
do
simon
ther
a
young
chap
as
works
for
squire
wurley
i
heard
as
he
wants
to
better
hisself
but
he
is
an
englebourn
man
is
there
anyone
in
the
parish
a
one
as
i
knows
on
what
do
you
think
of
harry
winburn
he
seems
a
good
hand
with
flowers
the
words
had
scarcely
passed
his
lips
when
tom
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
old
simon
retired
into
himself
at
once
and
a
cunning
distrustful
look
came
over
his
face
there
was
no
doing
anything
with
him
even
the
new
forcing
house
had
lost
its
attractions
for
him
and
tom
after
some
further
ineffectual
attempts
to
bring
him
round
returned
to
the
house
somewhat
crestfallen
well
how
have
you
succeeded
said
katie
looking
up
from
her
work
as
he
came
in
and
sat
down
near
her
table
tom
shook
his
head
i
afraid
i
made
a
regular
hash
of
it
he
said
i
thought
at
first
i
had
quite
come
round
the
old
savage
by
praising
the
garden
and
promising
that
you
would
let
him
have
a
new
house
you
do
mean
to
say
you
did
that
said
katie
stopping
her
work
indeed
but
i
did
though
i
was
drawn
on
you
know
i
saw
it
was
the
right
card
to
play
so
i
could
help
it
oh
tom
how
could
you
do
so
we
do
want
another
house
the
least
in
the
world
it
is
only
simon
vanity
he
wants
to
beat
the
gardener
at
the
grange
at
the
flower
shows
every
penny
will
have
to
come
out
of
what
papa
allows
me
for
the
parish
do
be
afraid
katie
you
wo
have
to
spend
a
penny
of
course
i
reserved
a
condition
the
new
house
was
to
be
put
up
if
he
would
take
harry
as
an
what
did
he
say
to
that
well
he
said
nothing
i
never
came
across
such
an
old
turk
how
you
have
spoiled
him
if
he
is
pleased
he
wo
take
the
trouble
to
answer
you
a
word
i
was
very
near
telling
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
but
he
all
the
more
i
believe
he
would
poison
harry
if
he
came
here
what
can
have
made
him
hate
him
so
he
is
jealous
of
him
mary
and
i
were
so
foolish
as
to
praise
poor
betty
flowers
before
simon
and
he
has
never
forgiven
it
i
think
too
that
he
suspects
somehow
that
we
talked
about
getting
harry
here
i
ought
to
have
told
you
but
i
quite
forgot
it
well
it
ca
be
helped
i
do
think
i
can
do
any
good
in
that
quarter
so
now
i
shall
be
off
to
the
grange
to
see
what
i
can
do
there
how
do
you
mean
why
harry
is
afraid
of
being
turned
out
of
his
cottage
i
saw
how
it
worried
him
thinking
about
it
so
i
shall
go
to
the
grange
and
say
a
good
word
for
him
wurley
ca
refuse
if
i
offer
to
pay
the
rent
myself
it
only
six
pounds
a
year
of
course
i
tell
harry
and
he
will
pay
it
all
the
same
but
it
may
make
all
the
difference
with
wurley
who
is
a
regular
screw
do
you
know
mr
wurley
yes
just
to
speak
to
he
knows
all
about
me
and
he
will
be
very
glad
to
be
civil
no
doubt
he
will
but
i
do
like
your
going
to
his
house
you
do
know
what
a
bad
man
he
is
nobody
but
men
on
the
turf
and
that
sort
of
people
go
there
now
and
i
believe
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
gambling
and
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
him
the
county
people
are
beginning
to
look
shy
at
him
so
he
be
all
the
more
likely
to
do
what
i
ask
him
but
you
wo
get
intimate
with
him
you
need
be
afraid
of
that
it
is
a
sad
house
to
go
to
i
hope
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
ah
katie
said
tom
with
a
smile
not
altogether
cheerful
i
do
think
you
need
be
anxious
about
that
when
one
has
been
a
year
at
oxford
there
is
much
snow
left
to
soil
so
now
i
am
off
i
must
give
myself
plenty
of
time
to
cook
wurley
well
i
suppose
i
must
not
hinder
you
said
katie
i
do
hope
you
will
succeed
in
some
of
your
kind
plans
for
harry
i
shall
do
my
best
and
it
is
a
great
thing
to
have
somebody
besides
oneself
to
think
about
and
try
to
help
some
poor
person
do
you
think
so
even
for
a
man
of
course
i
do
i
am
sure
you
ca
be
happy
without
it
any
more
than
i
we
should
be
our
mother
children
if
we
could
be
well
dear
you
ca
think
how
i
enjoy
these
glimpses
of
you
and
your
work
you
must
give
my
love
to
uncle
robert
and
so
they
bade
each
other
adieu
lovingly
after
the
manner
of
cousins
and
tom
rode
away
with
a
very
soft
place
in
his
heart
for
his
cousin
katie
it
was
not
the
least
the
same
sort
of
passionate
feeling
of
worship
with
which
he
regarded
mary
the
two
feelings
could
lie
side
by
side
in
his
heart
with
plenty
of
room
to
spare
in
fact
his
heart
had
been
getting
so
big
in
the
last
few
weeks
that
it
seemed
capable
of
taking
in
the
whole
of
mankind
not
to
mention
woman
till
on
the
whole
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
had
matters
been
at
all
in
a
more
forward
state
and
could
she
have
seen
exactly
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
mary
would
probably
have
objected
to
the
kind
of
affection
which
he
felt
for
his
cousin
at
this
particular
time
the
joke
about
cousinly
love
is
probably
as
old
and
certainly
as
true
as
solomon
proverbs
however
as
matters
stood
it
could
be
no
concern
of
mary
what
his
feelings
were
towards
katie
or
any
other
person
tom
rode
in
at
the
lodge
gate
of
the
grange
soon
after
eleven
and
walked
his
horse
slowly
through
the
park
admiring
the
splendid
timber
and
thinking
how
he
should
break
his
request
to
the
owner
of
the
place
but
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
proceedings
of
the
rabbits
which
were
out
by
hundreds
all
along
the
sides
of
the
plantations
and
round
the
great
trees
a
few
of
the
nearest
just
deigned
to
notice
him
by
scampering
to
their
holes
under
the
roots
of
the
antlered
oaks
into
which
some
of
them
popped
with
a
disdainful
kick
of
their
hind
legs
while
others
turned
round
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
as
he
neared
the
house
he
passed
a
keeper
cottage
and
was
saluted
by
the
barking
of
dogs
from
the
neighboring
kennel
and
the
young
pheasants
ran
about
round
some
twenty
which
were
arranged
along
opposite
the
door
where
the
keeper
children
were
playing
the
pleasure
of
watching
the
beasts
and
birds
kept
him
from
arranging
his
thoughts
and
he
reached
the
hall
door
without
having
formed
the
plan
of
his
campaign
a
footman
answered
the
bell
who
doubted
whether
his
master
was
down
but
thought
he
would
see
the
gentleman
if
he
would
send
in
his
name
whereupon
tom
handed
in
his
card
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
stable
boy
came
round
after
his
horse
and
the
butler
appeared
with
his
master
compliments
and
a
request
that
he
would
step
into
the
tom
followed
this
portly
personage
through
the
large
handsome
hall
on
the
walls
of
which
hung
a
or
two
and
some
arms
and
large
paintings
of
dead
game
and
fruit
through
a
drawing
room
the
furniture
of
which
was
all
covered
up
in
melancholy
cases
into
the
breakfast
parlor
where
the
owner
of
the
mansion
was
seated
at
table
in
a
lounging
jacket
he
was
a
man
of
forty
or
thereabouts
who
would
have
been
handsome
but
for
the
animal
look
about
his
face
his
cheeks
were
beginning
to
fall
into
chaps
his
full
lips
had
a
liquorish
look
about
them
and
bags
were
beginning
to
form
under
his
light
blue
eyes
his
hands
were
very
white
and
delicate
and
shook
a
little
as
he
poured
out
his
tea
and
he
was
full
and
stout
in
body
with
small
shoulders
and
thin
arms
and
legs
in
short
the
last
man
whom
tom
would
have
chosen
as
bow
in
a
pair
oar
the
only
part
of
him
which
showed
strength
were
his
dark
whiskers
which
were
abundant
and
elaborately
oiled
and
curled
the
room
was
light
and
pleasant
with
two
windows
looking
over
the
park
and
furnished
luxuriously
in
the
most
modern
style
with
all
manner
of
easy
chairs
and
sofas
a
glazed
case
or
two
of
well
bound
books
showed
that
some
former
owner
had
cared
for
such
things
but
the
doors
had
probably
never
been
opened
in
the
present
reign
the
master
and
his
usual
visitors
found
sufficient
food
for
the
mind
in
the
boxiana
the
adventures
of
corinthian
tom
and
which
lay
on
a
side
table
or
in
the
pictures
and
prints
of
racers
opera
dancers
and
which
hung
in
profusion
on
the
walls
the
breakfast
table
was
beautifully
appointed
in
the
matter
of
china
and
plate
and
delicate
little
rolls
neat
pats
of
butter
in
ice
two
silver
hot
dishes
containing
curry
and
broiled
salmon
and
a
plate
of
fruit
piled
in
tempting
profusion
appealed
apparently
in
vain
to
the
appetite
of
the
lord
of
the
feast
brown
sir
said
the
butler
ushering
in
our
hero
to
his
master
presence
ah
brown
i
very
glad
to
see
you
here
said
wurley
standing
up
and
holding
out
his
hand
have
any
breakfast
thank
you
no
i
have
breakfasted
said
tom
somewhat
astonished
at
the
intimacy
of
the
greeting
but
it
was
his
cue
to
do
the
friendly
thing
so
he
took
the
proffered
hand
which
felt
very
limp
and
sat
down
by
the
table
looking
pleasant
ridden
from
home
this
morning
said
wurley
picking
over
daintily
some
of
the
curry
to
which
he
had
helped
himself
no
i
was
at
my
uncle
at
englebourn
last
night
it
is
very
little
out
of
the
way
so
i
thought
i
would
just
call
on
my
road
home
quite
right
i
very
glad
you
came
without
ceremony
people
about
here
are
so
full
of
ceremony
it
do
suit
me
all
that
humbug
but
i
wish
you
just
pick
a
bit
thank
you
then
i
will
eat
some
fruit
said
tom
helping
himself
to
some
of
the
freshly
picked
grapes
how
very
fine
these
are
yes
i
open
to
back
my
houses
against
the
field
for
twenty
miles
round
this
curry
is
fit
for
a
pig
take
it
out
and
tell
the
cook
so
the
butler
solemnly
obeyed
while
his
master
went
on
with
one
of
the
frequent
oaths
with
which
he
garnished
his
conversation
you
right
they
ca
spoil
the
fruit
they
a
set
of
skulking
devils
are
servants
they
think
of
nothing
but
stuffing
themselves
and
how
they
can
cheat
you
most
and
do
the
least
work
saying
which
he
helped
himself
to
some
fruit
and
the
two
ate
their
grapes
for
a
short
time
in
silence
but
even
fruit
seemed
to
pall
quickly
on
him
and
he
pushed
away
his
plate
the
butler
came
back
with
a
silver
tray
with
soda
water
and
a
small
decanter
of
brandy
and
long
glasses
on
it
wo
you
have
something
after
your
ride
said
the
host
to
tom
some
soda
water
with
a
dash
of
bingo
clears
one
head
in
the
morning
no
thank
you
said
tom
smiling
it
bad
for
training
ah
you
oxford
men
are
all
for
training
said
his
host
drinking
greedily
of
the
foaming
mixture
which
the
butler
handed
to
him
a
glass
of
bitter
ale
is
what
you
take
eh
i
know
get
some
ale
for
mr
brown
tom
felt
that
it
would
be
uncivil
to
refuse
this
orthodox
offer
and
took
his
beer
accordingly
after
which
his
host
produced
a
box
of
hudson
regalias
and
proposed
to
look
at
the
stables
so
they
lighted
their
cigars
and
went
out
wurley
had
taken
of
late
to
the
turf
and
they
inspected
several
young
horses
which
were
entered
for
country
stakes
tom
thought
them
animals
but
patiently
listened
to
their
praises
and
pedigrees
upon
which
his
host
was
eloquent
enough
and
rubbing
up
his
latest
readings
in
and
the
racing
talk
which
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
hearing
in
drysdale
rooms
managed
to
hold
his
own
and
asked
with
a
grave
face
about
the
price
of
the
coronation
colt
for
the
next
derby
and
whether
scott
lot
was
not
the
right
thing
to
stand
on
for
the
leger
thereby
raising
himself
considerably
in
his
host
eyes
there
were
no
hunters
in
the
stable
at
which
tom
expressed
his
surprise
in
reply
wurley
abused
the
country
and
declared
that
it
was
not
worth
riding
across
the
fact
being
that
he
had
lost
his
nerve
and
that
the
reception
which
he
was
beginning
to
meet
with
in
the
field
if
he
came
out
by
chance
was
of
the
coldest
from
the
stables
they
strolled
to
the
keeper
cottage
where
wurley
called
for
some
buckwheat
and
indian
corn
and
began
feeding
the
young
pheasants
which
were
running
about
almost
like
fowls
close
to
them
we
had
a
good
season
for
the
young
birds
he
said
my
fellow
knows
that
part
of
his
business
d
n
him
and
do
lose
many
you
had
better
bring
your
gun
over
in
october
we
shall
have
a
week
in
the
covers
early
in
the
month
thank
you
i
shall
be
very
glad
said
tom
but
you
do
shoot
these
birds
shoot
what
the
devil
should
i
do
with
why
they
so
tame
i
thought
you
just
kept
them
about
the
house
for
breeding
i
do
care
so
much
for
pheasant
shooting
i
like
a
good
walk
after
a
snipe
or
creeping
along
to
get
a
wild
duck
much
better
there
some
sport
in
it
or
even
in
partridge
shooting
with
a
couple
of
good
dogs
now
you
quite
wrong
there
nothing
like
a
good
dry
ride
in
a
cover
with
lots
of
game
and
a
fellow
behind
to
load
for
you
well
i
must
say
i
prefer
the
open
you
no
covers
over
your
way
have
you
not
many
i
thought
so
you
wait
till
you
had
a
good
day
in
my
covers
and
you
wo
care
for
quartering
all
day
over
wet
turnips
besides
this
sort
of
thing
pays
they
talk
about
pheasants
costing
a
guinea
a
head
on
one
table
it
all
stuff
at
any
rate
mine
do
cost
much
in
fact
i
say
it
pays
and
i
can
prove
it
but
you
feed
your
pheasants
yes
just
round
the
house
for
a
few
weeks
and
i
sow
a
little
buckwheat
in
the
covers
but
they
have
to
keep
themselves
pretty
much
i
can
tell
you
do
the
farmers
object
yes
them
they
never
satisfied
but
they
do
grumble
to
me
they
know
better
there
are
a
dozen
fellows
ready
to
take
any
farm
that
given
up
and
they
know
it
just
get
a
beggar
to
put
a
hundred
or
two
into
the
ground
and
he
wo
quit
hold
in
a
hurry
will
you
play
a
game
at
billiards
the
turn
which
their
conversation
had
taken
hitherto
had
offered
no
opening
to
tom
for
introducing
the
object
of
his
visit
and
he
felt
less
and
less
inclined
to
come
to
the
point
he
looked
his
host
over
and
over
again
and
the
more
he
looked
the
less
he
fancied
asking
anything
like
a
favor
of
him
however
as
it
had
to
be
done
he
thought
he
could
do
better
than
fall
into
his
ways
for
a
few
hours
and
watch
for
a
chance
the
man
seemed
good
natured
in
his
way
and
all
his
belongings
the
fine
park
and
house
and
gardens
and
stables
were
not
without
their
effect
on
his
young
guest
it
is
not
given
to
many
men
of
twice
his
age
to
separate
a
man
from
his
possessions
and
look
at
him
apart
from
them
so
he
yielded
easily
enough
and
they
went
to
billiards
in
a
fine
room
opening
out
of
the
hall
and
tom
who
was
very
fond
of
the
game
soon
forgot
everything
in
the
pleasure
of
playing
on
such
a
table
it
was
not
a
bad
match
wurley
understood
the
game
far
better
than
his
guest
and
could
give
him
advice
as
to
what
side
to
put
on
and
how
to
play
for
cannons
this
he
did
in
a
patronizing
way
but
his
hand
was
unsteady
and
his
nerve
bad
tom
good
eye
and
steady
hand
and
the
practice
he
had
had
at
the
ambrose
gave
him
considerable
advantage
in
the
hazards
and
so
they
played
on
wurley
condescending
to
bet
only
a
game
at
first
giving
ten
points
and
then
five
at
which
latter
odds
tom
managed
to
be
two
games
ahead
when
the
butler
announced
lunch
at
two
i
think
i
must
order
my
horse
said
tom
putting
on
his
coat
no
curse
it
you
must
give
me
my
revenge
i
always
five
points
better
after
lunch
and
after
dinner
i
could
give
you
fifteen
points
why
should
you
stop
and
dine
and
sleep
i
expect
some
men
to
dinner
thank
you
i
must
get
home
i
should
like
you
to
taste
my
mutton
i
never
kill
it
five
years
old
you
do
get
that
every
day
tom
however
was
proof
against
the
mutton
but
consented
to
stay
till
towards
the
hour
when
the
other
guests
were
expected
finding
that
his
host
had
a
decided
objection
to
be
left
alone
so
after
lunch
at
which
wurley
drank
the
better
part
of
a
bottle
of
old
sherry
to
steady
his
nerves
they
returned
again
to
billiards
and
hudson
regalias
they
played
on
for
another
hour
and
though
wurley
hand
was
certainly
steadier
the
luck
remained
with
tom
he
was
now
getting
rather
tired
of
playing
and
wanted
to
be
leaving
and
he
began
to
remember
the
object
of
his
visit
again
but
wurley
was
nettled
at
being
beaten
by
a
boy
as
he
counted
his
opponent
and
would
hear
of
leaving
off
so
tom
played
on
carelessly
game
after
game
and
was
soon
again
only
two
games
ahead
wurley
temper
was
recovering
and
tom
protested
that
he
must
go
just
one
game
more
his
host
urged
and
tom
consented
would
he
play
for
a
sovereign
no
so
they
played
double
or
quits
and
after
a
sharp
struggle
wurley
won
the
game
at
which
he
was
highly
elated
and
talked
again
grandly
of
the
odds
he
could
give
after
dinner
tom
felt
that
it
was
now
or
never
and
so
as
he
put
on
his
coat
he
said
well
i
much
obliged
to
you
for
a
very
pleasant
day
mr
wurley
i
hope
you
come
over
again
and
stay
and
sleep
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
it
is
so
cursed
hard
to
keep
somebody
always
going
in
the
country
thank
you
i
should
like
to
come
again
but
now
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
before
i
go
eh
well
what
is
it
said
wurley
whose
face
and
manner
became
suddenly
anything
but
encouraging
there
that
cottage
of
yours
the
one
at
the
corner
of
englebourn
copse
next
the
village
the
woodman
house
i
know
said
wurley
the
tenant
is
dead
and
i
want
you
to
let
it
to
a
friend
of
mine
i
take
care
the
rent
is
paid
wurley
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
announcement
he
gave
a
sharp
look
at
tom
and
then
bent
over
the
table
made
a
stroke
and
said
ah
i
heard
the
old
woman
was
dead
who
your
friend
then
well
i
mean
her
son
said
tom
somewhat
embarrassed
he
an
active
young
fellow
and
will
make
a
good
tenant
i
sure
i
daresay
said
wurley
with
a
leer
and
i
suppose
a
sister
to
keep
house
for
him
eh
no
but
he
wants
to
get
married
wants
to
get
married
eh
said
wurley
with
another
leer
and
oath
you
right
that
a
deal
safer
kind
of
thing
for
you
yes
said
tom
resolutely
disregarding
the
insinuation
which
he
could
not
help
feeling
was
intended
it
will
keep
him
steady
and
if
he
can
get
the
cottage
it
might
make
all
the
difference
there
would
be
much
trouble
about
the
marriage
then
i
dare
say
you
find
it
a
devilish
long
way
you
quite
right
mind
you
not
to
get
them
settled
close
at
home
but
englebourn
is
too
far
i
should
say
what
does
it
matter
to
me
oh
you
tired
of
her
i
see
perhaps
it
wo
be
too
far
then
tired
of
her
who
do
you
mean
ha
ha
said
wurley
looking
up
from
the
table
over
which
he
was
leaning
for
he
went
on
knocking
the
balls
about
devilish
well
acted
but
you
need
try
to
come
the
old
soldier
over
me
i
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
that
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
coming
the
old
soldier
i
only
asked
you
to
let
the
cottage
and
i
will
be
responsible
for
the
rent
i
pay
in
advance
if
you
like
yes
you
want
me
to
let
the
cottage
for
you
to
put
in
this
girl
i
beg
your
pardon
said
tom
interrupting
him
and
scarcely
able
to
keep
his
temper
i
told
you
it
was
for
this
young
winburn
of
course
you
told
me
so
ha
ha
and
you
do
believe
me
come
now
all
fair
in
love
and
war
but
i
tell
you
you
need
be
with
me
you
do
mind
his
living
there
he
away
at
work
all
day
eh
and
his
wife
stays
at
home
wurley
i
give
you
my
honor
i
never
saw
the
girl
in
my
life
that
i
know
of
and
i
do
know
that
she
will
marry
him
what
did
you
talk
about
your
friend
for
then
said
wurley
stopping
and
staring
at
tom
curiosity
beginning
to
mingle
with
his
look
of
cunning
unbelief
because
i
meant
just
what
i
said
and
the
friend
then
i
have
told
you
several
times
that
this
young
winburn
is
the
man
what
yes
my
friend
said
tom
and
he
felt
himself
getting
red
at
having
to
call
harry
his
friend
in
such
company
wurley
looked
at
him
for
a
few
moments
and
then
took
his
leg
off
the
billiard
table
and
came
round
to
tom
with
the
sort
of
patronizing
air
with
which
he
had
lectured
him
on
billiards
i
say
brown
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
he
said
a
young
fellow
and
have
seen
anything
of
the
world
all
very
well
but
it
is
the
world
now
i
tell
you
a
young
fellow
ca
do
himself
greater
harm
than
getting
into
low
company
and
talking
as
you
have
been
talking
it
might
ruin
you
in
the
county
that
sort
of
radical
stuff
wo
do
you
know
calling
a
farm
laborer
your
friend
tom
chafed
at
this
advice
from
a
man
who
he
well
knew
was
notoriously
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
at
his
house
and
living
familiarly
with
betting
men
and
trainers
and
all
the
of
the
turf
but
he
restrained
himself
by
a
considerable
effort
and
instead
of
retorting
as
he
felt
inclined
to
do
said
with
an
attempt
to
laugh
it
off
thank
you
i
do
think
much
fear
of
me
turning
radical
but
will
you
let
me
the
cottage
my
agent
manages
all
that
we
talked
about
pulling
it
down
the
cottage
is
in
my
preserves
and
i
do
mean
to
have
some
poaching
fellow
there
to
be
sneaking
out
at
night
after
my
pheasants
but
his
grandfather
and
lived
there
i
dare
say
but
it
my
cottage
but
surely
that
gives
him
a
claim
to
it
it
it
my
cottage
you
not
going
to
tell
me
i
may
do
what
i
like
with
it
i
suppose
i
only
said
that
his
family
having
lived
there
so
long
gives
him
a
claim
a
claim
to
what
these
are
some
more
of
your
cursed
radical
notions
i
think
they
might
teach
you
something
better
at
oxford
tom
was
now
perfectly
cool
but
withal
in
such
a
tremendous
fury
of
excitement
that
he
forgot
the
interests
of
his
client
altogether
i
came
here
sir
he
said
very
quietly
and
slowly
not
to
request
your
advice
on
my
own
account
or
your
opinion
on
the
studies
of
oxford
valuable
as
no
doubt
they
are
i
came
to
ask
you
to
let
this
cottage
to
me
and
i
wish
to
have
your
answer
i
be
if
i
do
there
my
answer
very
well
said
tom
then
i
have
only
to
wish
you
good
morning
i
am
sorry
to
have
wasted
a
day
in
the
company
of
a
man
who
sets
up
for
a
country
gentleman
with
the
tongue
of
a
thames
bargee
and
the
heart
of
a
jew
wurley
rushed
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
furiously
by
he
almost
screamed
shaking
his
fist
at
tom
i
have
you
out
of
my
house
and
then
poured
forth
a
flood
of
uncomplimentary
slang
ending
in
another
pull
at
the
bell
and
by
i
have
you
out
of
my
house
you
had
better
try
it
on
you
and
your
flunkeys
together
said
tom
taking
a
cigar
case
out
of
his
pocket
and
lighting
up
the
most
defiant
and
exasperating
action
he
could
think
of
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
here
one
of
them
so
i
leave
you
to
give
him
his
orders
and
wait
five
minutes
in
the
hall
where
there
more
room
and
so
leaving
the
footman
gaping
at
his
lord
he
turned
on
his
heel
with
the
air
of
bernardo
del
carpio
after
he
had
bearded
king
alphonso
and
walked
into
the
hall
he
heard
men
running
to
and
fro
and
doors
banging
as
he
stood
there
looking
at
the
old
and
rather
thirsting
for
a
fight
presently
a
door
opened
and
the
portly
butler
shuffled
in
looking
considerably
embarrassed
and
said
please
sir
to
go
out
quiet
else
he
be
having
one
of
his
fits
your
master
you
mean
yes
sir
said
the
butler
nodding
sir
after
one
of
his
rages
the
black
dog
comes
and
it
hawful
work
so
i
hope
you
go
sir
very
well
of
course
i
go
i
do
want
to
give
him
fit
saying
which
tom
walked
out
of
the
and
leisurely
round
to
the
stables
where
he
found
already
signs
of
commotion
without
regarding
them
he
got
his
horse
saddled
and
bridled
and
after
looking
him
over
carefully
and
patting
him
and
feeling
his
girths
in
the
yard
in
the
presence
of
a
cluster
of
retainers
of
one
sort
or
another
who
were
gathered
from
the
house
and
offices
and
looking
sorely
puzzled
whether
to
commence
hostilities
or
not
mounted
and
walked
quietly
out
after
his
anger
had
been
a
little
cooled
by
the
fresh
air
of
the
wild
country
at
the
back
of
hawk
lynch
which
he
struck
into
on
his
way
home
soon
after
leaving
the
park
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
however
satisfactory
to
himself
the
results
of
his
encounter
with
this
unjust
landlord
might
seem
they
would
probably
prove
anything
but
agreeable
to
the
tenant
harry
winburn
in
fact
as
he
meditated
on
the
matter
it
became
clear
to
him
that
in
the
course
of
one
morning
he
had
probably
exasperated
old
simon
against
his
aspirant
and
put
a
serious
spoke
in
harry
on
the
one
hand
while
on
the
other
he
had
ensured
his
speedy
expulsion
from
his
cottage
if
not
the
demolition
of
that
building
whereupon
he
became
somewhat
low
under
the
conviction
that
his
friendship
which
was
to
work
such
wonders
for
the
said
harry
and
deliver
him
out
of
all
his
troubles
had
as
yet
only
made
his
whole
in
the
world
very
much
darker
and
more
dusty
in
short
as
yet
he
had
managed
to
do
considerably
less
than
nothing
for
his
friend
and
he
felt
very
small
before
he
got
home
that
evening
he
was
far
however
from
being
prepared
for
the
serious
way
in
which
his
father
looked
upon
his
day
proceedings
brown
was
sitting
by
himself
after
dinner
when
his
son
turned
up
and
had
to
drink
several
extra
glasses
of
port
to
keep
himself
decently
composed
while
tom
narrated
the
events
of
the
day
in
the
intervals
of
his
attacks
on
the
dinner
which
was
brought
back
for
him
when
the
servant
had
cleared
away
brown
proceeded
to
comment
on
the
history
in
a
most
decided
manner
tom
was
wrong
to
go
to
the
grange
in
the
first
instance
and
this
part
of
the
homily
was
amplified
by
a
discourse
on
the
corruption
of
the
turf
in
general
and
the
special
curse
of
small
country
races
in
particular
which
such
men
as
wurley
supported
and
which
but
for
them
would
cease
racing
which
used
to
be
the
pastime
of
great
people
who
could
well
afford
to
spend
a
few
thousands
a
year
on
their
pleasure
had
now
mostly
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
very
worst
and
lowest
men
of
all
classes
most
of
whom
would
not
scruple
as
brown
strongly
put
it
to
steal
a
copper
out
of
a
blind
beggar
hat
if
he
must
go
at
any
rate
he
might
have
done
his
errand
and
come
away
instead
of
staying
there
all
day
accepting
the
man
hospitality
brown
himself
really
should
be
much
embarrassed
to
know
what
to
do
if
the
man
should
happen
to
attend
the
next
sessions
or
assizes
but
above
all
having
accepted
his
hospitality
to
turn
round
at
the
end
and
insult
the
man
in
his
own
house
this
seemed
to
brown
a
monstrous
and
astounding
performance
this
new
way
of
putting
matters
took
tom
entirely
by
surprise
he
attempted
a
defense
but
in
vain
his
father
admitted
that
it
would
be
a
hard
case
if
harry
were
turned
out
of
his
cottage
but
wholly
refused
to
listen
to
tom
endeavors
to
prove
that
a
tenant
in
such
a
case
had
any
claim
or
right
as
against
his
landlord
a
weekly
tenant
was
a
weekly
tenant
and
no
succession
of
weeks
holding
could
make
him
anything
more
tom
found
himself
rushing
into
a
line
of
argument
which
astonished
himself
and
sounded
wild
but
in
which
he
felt
sure
there
was
some
truth
and
which
therefore
he
would
not
abandon
though
his
father
was
evidently
annoyed
and
called
it
mere
mischievous
sentiment
each
was
more
moved
than
he
would
have
liked
to
own
each
in
his
own
heart
felt
aggrieved
and
blamed
the
other
for
not
understanding
him
but
though
obstinate
on
the
general
question
upon
the
point
of
his
leaving
the
grange
tom
was
fairly
brought
to
shame
and
gave
in
at
last
and
expressed
his
sorrow
though
he
could
not
help
maintaining
that
if
his
father
could
have
heard
what
took
place
and
seen
the
man
manner
he
would
scarcely
blame
him
for
what
he
had
said
and
done
having
owned
himself
in
the
wrong
however
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
write
an
apology
the
composition
of
which
was
as
disagreeable
a
task
as
had
ever
fallen
to
his
lot

in

bright

of

a
day
nutting
against
the
world
a
day
in
autumn
warm
enough
to
make
sitting
in
the
sheltered
nooks
in
the
woods
where
ever
the
sunshine
lies
very
pleasant
and
yet
not
too
warm
to
make
exercise
uncomfortable
two
young
people
who
have
been
thrown
much
together
one
of
whom
is
conscious
of
the
state
of
his
feelings
towards
the
other
and
is
moreover
aware
that
his
hours
are
numbered
and
that
in
a
few
days
at
furthest
they
will
be
separated
for
many
months
that
persons
in
authority
on
both
sides
are
beginning
to
suspect
something
as
is
apparent
from
the
difficulty
they
have
had
in
getting
away
together
at
all
on
this
same
afternoon
here
is
a
conjunction
of
persons
and
circumstances
if
ever
there
was
one
in
the
world
which
is
surely
likely
to
end
in
a
catastrophe
indeed
so
obvious
to
the
meanest
capacity
is
the
danger
of
the
situation
that
as
tom
had
in
his
own
mind
staked
his
character
for
resolution
with
his
private
self
on
the
keeping
of
his
secret
till
after
he
was
of
age
it
is
hard
to
conceive
how
he
can
have
been
foolish
enough
to
get
himself
into
a
hazel
copse
alone
with
miss
mary
on
the
earliest
day
he
could
manage
it
after
the
arrival
of
the
porters
on
their
visit
to
and
brown
that
is
to
say
it
would
be
hard
to
conceive
if
it
did
just
happen
to
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
the
first
hours
after
their
meeting
in
the
home
of
his
fathers
the
two
young
people
and
tom
in
particular
felt
very
uncomfortable
mary
being
a
young
lady
of
very
high
spirits
and
as
our
readers
may
probably
have
discovered
much
given
to
that
kind
of
conversation
which
borders
as
nearly
upon
what
men
commonly
call
chaff
as
a
girl
can
venture
on
was
annoyed
to
find
herself
quite
at
fault
in
all
her
attempts
to
get
her
old
antagonist
of
commemoration
to
show
fight
she
felt
in
a
moment
how
changed
his
manner
was
and
thought
it
by
no
means
changed
for
the
better
as
for
tom
he
felt
foolish
and
shy
at
first
to
an
extent
which
drove
him
half
wild
his
words
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
took
to
blushing
again
like
a
boy
of
fourteen
in
fact
he
got
so
angry
with
himself
that
he
rather
avoided
her
actual
presence
though
she
was
scarcely
a
moment
out
of
his
sight
brown
made
the
best
of
his
son
retreat
devoted
himself
most
gallantly
to
mary
and
was
completely
captivated
by
her
before
bedtime
on
the
first
night
of
their
visit
he
triumphed
over
his
wife
when
they
were
alone
and
laughed
at
the
groundlessness
of
her
suspicions
but
she
was
by
no
means
so
satisfied
on
the
subject
as
her
husband
in
a
day
or
two
however
tom
began
to
take
heart
of
grace
and
to
find
himself
oftener
at
mary
side
with
something
to
say
and
more
to
look
but
now
she
in
her
turn
began
to
be
embarrassed
for
all
attempts
to
their
old
footing
failed
and
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
satisfactory
new
one
remained
to
be
solved
so
for
the
present
though
neither
of
them
found
it
quite
satisfactory
they
took
refuge
in
the
presence
of
a
third
party
and
attached
themselves
to
katie
talking
at
one
another
through
her
nothing
could
exceed
katie
judiciousness
as
a
medium
of
communication
and
through
her
a
better
understanding
began
to
establish
itself
and
the
visit
which
both
of
them
had
been
looking
forward
to
so
eagerly
seemed
likely
after
all
to
be
as
pleasant
in
fact
as
it
had
been
in
anticipation
as
they
became
more
at
ease
the
vigilance
of
brown
and
porter
seemed
likely
to
revive
but
in
a
country
house
there
must
be
plenty
of
chances
for
young
folks
who
mean
it
to
be
together
and
so
they
found
and
made
use
of
their
opportunities
giving
at
the
same
time
as
little
cause
to
their
natural
guardians
as
possible
for
any
serious
interference
the
families
got
on
on
the
whole
so
well
together
that
the
visit
was
prolonged
from
the
original
four
or
five
days
to
a
fortnight
and
this
time
of
grace
was
drawing
to
a
close
when
the
event
happened
which
made
the
visit
memorable
to
our
hero
on
the
morning
in
question
brown
arranged
at
breakfast
that
he
and
his
wife
should
drive
and
porter
to
make
calls
on
several
of
the
neighbors
tom
declared
his
intention
of
taking
a
long
day
after
the
partridges
and
the
young
ladies
were
to
go
and
make
a
sketch
of
the
house
from
a
point
which
katie
had
chosen
accordingly
directly
after
luncheon
the
carriage
came
round
and
the
elders
departed
and
the
young
ladies
started
together
carrying
their
sketching
apparatus
with
them
it
was
probably
a
bad
day
for
scent
for
they
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
tom
came
home
deposited
his
gun
and
followed
on
their
steps
he
found
them
sitting
under
the
lee
of
a
high
bank
sufficiently
intent
on
their
drawings
but
neither
surprised
nor
sorry
to
find
that
he
had
altered
his
mind
and
come
back
to
interrupt
them
so
he
lay
down
near
them
and
talked
of
oxford
and
englebourn
and
so
from
one
thing
to
another
till
he
got
upon
the
subject
of
nutting
and
the
sylvan
beauties
of
a
neighbouring
wood
mary
was
getting
on
badly
with
her
drawing
and
jumped
at
the
idea
of
a
ramble
in
the
wood
but
katie
was
obdurate
and
resisted
all
their
solicitations
to
move
she
suggested
however
that
they
might
go
and
as
tom
declared
that
they
should
not
be
out
of
call
and
would
be
back
in
half
an
hour
at
furthest
mary
consented
and
they
left
the
sketcher
and
strolled
together
out
of
the
fields
and
into
the
road
and
so
through
a
gate
into
the
wood
it
was
a
pleasant
oak
wood
the
wild
flowers
were
over
but
the
great
masses
of
ferns
four
or
five
feet
high
made
a
grand
carpet
round
the
stems
of
the
forest
monarchs
and
a
fitting
couch
for
here
and
there
one
of
them
which
had
been
lately
felled
and
lay
in
fallen
majesty
with
bare
shrouded
trunk
awaiting
the
sawyers
further
on
the
hazel
underwood
stood
thickly
on
each
side
of
the
green
rides
down
which
they
sauntered
side
by
side
tom
talked
of
the
beauty
of
the
wood
in
and
the
glorious
succession
of
colouring
pale
yellow
and
deep
blue
and
white
and
purple
which
the
primroses
and
hyacinths
and
starwort
and
foxgloves
gave
each
in
their
turn
in
the
early
year
and
mourned
over
their
absence
but
mary
preferred
autumn
and
would
not
agree
with
him
she
was
enthusiastic
for
ferns
and
heather
he
gathered
some
sprigs
of
the
latter
for
her
from
a
little
sandy
patch
which
they
passed
and
some
more
for
his
own
and
then
they
engaged
in
the
absorbing
pursuit
of
nutting
and
the
talk
almost
ceased
he
caught
the
higher
branches
and
bent
them
down
to
her
and
watched
her
as
she
gathered
them
and
wondered
at
the
ease
and
grace
of
all
her
movements
and
the
unconscious
beauty
of
her
attitudes
soon
she
became
more
enterprising
herself
and
made
little
excursions
into
the
copse
surmounting
briers
and
passing
through
tangled
places
like
a
naiad
before
he
could
be
there
to
help
her
and
so
they
went
on
along
the
rides
and
through
the
copse
forgetting
katie
and
time
till
they
were
brought
up
by
the
fence
on
the
further
side
of
the
wood
the
ditch
was
on
the
outside
and
on
the
inside
a
bank
with
a
hedge
on
the
top
full
of
tempting
she
clapped
her
hands
at
the
sight
and
declining
his
help
stepped
lightly
up
the
bank
and
began
gathering
he
turned
away
for
a
moment
jumped
up
the
bank
himself
and
followed
her
example
he
was
standing
up
in
the
hedge
and
reaching
after
a
tempting
cluster
of
nuts
when
he
heard
a
short
sharp
cry
of
pain
behind
him
which
made
him
spring
backwards
and
nearly
miss
his
footing
as
he
came
to
the
ground
recovering
himself
and
turning
round
he
saw
mary
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
writhing
in
pain
he
was
at
her
side
in
a
minute
and
dreadfully
alarmed
good
heavens
what
has
happened
he
said
my
ankle
she
cried
and
the
effort
of
speaking
brought
the
sudden
flush
of
pain
to
her
brow
oh
what
can
i
do
the
boot
the
boot
she
said
leaning
forward
to
unlace
it
and
then
sinking
back
against
the
bank
it
is
so
painful
i
hope
i
faint
poor
tom
could
only
clasp
his
hands
as
he
knelt
by
her
and
repeat
oh
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
his
utter
bewilderment
presently
aroused
mary
and
her
natural
high
courage
was
beginning
to
master
the
pain
have
you
a
knife
yes
here
he
said
pulling
one
out
of
his
pocket
and
opening
it
here
it
is
please
cut
the
lace
tom
with
beating
heart
and
trembling
hand
cut
the
lace
and
then
looked
up
at
her
oh
be
quick
cut
it
again
do
be
afraid
he
cut
it
again
and
without
taking
hold
of
the
foot
gently
pulled
out
the
ends
of
the
lace
she
again
leaned
forward
and
tried
to
take
off
the
boot
but
the
pain
was
too
great
and
she
sank
back
and
put
her
hand
up
to
her
flushed
face
may
i
try
perhaps
i
could
do
it
yes
pray
do
oh
i
ca
bear
the
pain
she
added
next
moment
and
tom
felt
ready
to
hang
himself
for
having
been
the
cause
of
it
you
must
cut
the
boot
off
please
but
perhaps
i
may
cut
you
do
you
really
mean
it
yes
really
there
take
care
how
your
hand
shakes
you
will
never
do
for
a
doctor
his
hand
did
shake
certainly
he
had
cut
a
little
hole
the
stocking
but
under
the
circumstances
we
need
not
wonder
the
situation
was
new
and
trying
urged
on
by
her
he
cut
and
cut
away
and
at
last
off
came
the
boot
and
her
beautiful
little
foot
lay
on
the
green
turf
she
was
much
relieved
at
once
but
still
in
great
pain
and
now
he
began
to
recover
his
head
the
ankle
should
be
bound
up
may
i
try
oh
yes
but
what
with
tom
dived
into
his
pocket
and
produced
one
of
the
large
which
were
fashionable
at
oxford
in
those
days
how
lucky
he
said
as
he
tore
it
into
strips
i
think
this
will
do
now
you
stop
me
wo
you
if
i
hurt
you
or
do
it
right
do
be
afraid
i
much
better
bind
it
tight
tighter
than
that
he
wound
the
strips
as
tenderly
as
he
could
round
her
foot
and
ankle
with
hands
all
alive
with
nerves
and
wondering
more
and
more
at
her
courage
as
she
kept
urging
him
to
draw
the
bandage
tighter
yet
then
still
under
her
direction
he
fastened
and
pinned
down
the
ends
and
as
he
was
rather
neat
with
his
fingers
from
the
practice
of
tying
flies
and
splicing
rods
and
bats
produced
on
the
whole
a
creditable
sort
of
bandage
then
he
looked
up
at
her
the
perspiration
standing
on
his
forehead
as
if
he
had
been
pulling
a
race
and
said
will
that
do
i
afraid
it
very
awkward
oh
no
thank
you
so
much
but
i
so
sorry
you
have
torn
your
handkerchief
tom
made
no
answer
to
this
remark
except
by
a
look
what
could
he
say
but
that
he
would
gladly
have
torn
his
skin
off
for
the
same
purpose
if
it
would
have
been
of
any
use
but
this
speech
did
not
seem
quite
the
thing
for
the
moment
but
how
do
you
feel
is
it
very
painful
he
asked
rather
but
do
look
so
anxious
indeed
it
is
very
bearable
but
what
are
we
to
do
now
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
said
with
something
like
a
sigh
shall
i
run
home
and
bring
the
servants
and
a
sofa
or
something
to
carry
you
on
no
i
should
like
to
be
left
here
alone
his
face
brightened
again
how
near
is
the
nearest
cottage
she
asked
there
none
nearer
than
the
one
which
we
passed
on
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
the
wood
you
know
then
i
must
try
to
get
there
you
must
help
me
up
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stooped
over
her
doubting
how
to
begin
helping
her
he
had
never
felt
so
shy
in
his
life
he
held
out
his
hands
i
think
you
must
put
your
arm
round
me
she
said
after
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
he
lifted
her
on
to
her
feet
now
let
me
lean
on
your
arm
there
i
dare
say
i
shall
manage
to
hobble
along
well
enough
and
she
made
a
brave
attempt
to
walk
but
the
moment
the
injured
foot
touched
the
ground
she
stopped
with
a
catch
at
her
breath
and
a
shiver
which
went
through
tom
like
a
knife
and
the
flush
came
back
into
her
face
and
she
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
again
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
held
her
up
i
am
better
again
now
she
said
after
a
second
or
two
but
mary
dear
mary
do
try
to
walk
again
for
my
sake
i
ca
bear
it
but
what
am
i
to
do
she
said
i
must
get
back
somehow
will
you
let
me
carry
you
she
looked
in
his
face
again
and
then
dropped
her
eyes
and
hesitated
i
would
offer
dear
if
there
were
any
other
way
but
you
must
walk
indeed
you
must
not
you
may
lame
yourself
for
life
he
spoke
very
quietly
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
though
his
heart
was
beating
so
that
he
feared
she
would
hear
it
very
well
she
said
but
i
very
heavy
so
he
lifted
her
gently
and
stepped
off
down
the
ride
carrying
his
whole
world
in
his
arms
in
an
indescribable
flutter
of
joy
and
triumph
and
fear
he
had
gone
some
forty
yards
or
so
when
he
staggered
and
stopped
for
a
moment
oh
pray
put
me
down
pray
do
you
hurt
yourself
i
too
heavy
for
the
credit
of
muscular
christianity
one
must
say
that
it
was
not
her
weight
but
the
tumult
in
his
own
inner
man
which
made
her
bearer
totter
nevertheless
if
one
is
wholly
unused
to
the
exercise
the
carrying
of
a
healthy
young
english
girl
weighing
a
good
eight
stone
is
as
much
as
most
men
can
conveniently
manage
i
just
put
you
down
for
a
moment
he
said
now
take
care
of
the
foot
and
he
stooped
and
placed
her
tenderly
against
one
of
the
oaks
which
bordered
the
ride
standing
by
her
side
without
looking
at
her
neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
minute
then
he
asked
still
looking
away
down
the
ride
how
is
the
foot
oh
pretty
well
she
answered
cheerfully
now
leave
me
here
and
go
for
help
it
is
absurd
of
me
to
mind
being
left
and
you
must
carry
me
any
more
he
turned
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
but
that
was
enough
are
you
ready
he
said
yes
but
take
care
do
go
far
stop
directly
you
feel
tired
then
he
lifted
her
again
and
this
time
carried
her
without
faltering
till
they
came
to
a
hillock
covered
with
soft
grass
here
they
rested
again
and
so
by
easy
stages
he
carried
her
through
the
wood
and
out
into
the
road
to
the
nearest
cottage
neither
of
them
speaking
an
old
woman
came
to
the
door
in
answer
to
his
kick
and
went
off
into
ejaculations
of
pity
and
wonder
in
the
broadest
berkshire
at
seeing
master
tom
and
his
burthen
but
he
pushed
into
the
house
and
cut
her
short
with
now
pike
do
talk
that
a
dear
good
woman
but
bustle
about
and
bring
that
here
and
the
other
low
one
with
a
pillow
on
it
for
the
young
lady
foot
to
rest
on
the
old
woman
obeyed
his
injunctions
except
as
to
talking
and
while
she
placed
the
chairs
and
shook
up
the
pillow
descanted
on
the
sovereign
virtues
of
some
green
oil
and
opodeldoc
which
was
as
good
as
a
charm
for
sprains
and
bruises
mary
gave
him
one
grateful
look
as
he
lowered
her
tenderly
and
reluctantly
into
the
chair
and
then
spoke
cheerfully
to
pike
who
was
foraging
in
a
cupboard
to
find
if
there
was
any
of
her
famous
specific
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
as
he
stood
up
and
thought
what
to
do
next
he
heard
the
sound
of
distant
wheels
and
looking
through
the
window
saw
the
carriage
coming
homewards
it
was
a
sorrowful
sight
to
him
now
pike
he
said
never
mind
the
oil
here
the
carriage
coming
just
step
out
and
stop
it
the
old
dame
scuttled
out
into
the
road
the
carriage
was
within
one
hundred
yards
he
leant
over
the
rough
in
which
mary
was
leaning
back
looked
once
more
into
her
eyes
and
then
stooping
forwards
kissed
her
lips
and
the
next
moment
was
by
the
side
of
pike
signalling
the
coachman
to
stop
in
the
bustle
which
followed
he
stood
aside
and
watched
mary
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
she
never
looked
at
him
but
there
was
no
anger
but
only
a
dreamy
look
in
her
sweet
face
which
seemed
to
him
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
ever
before
then
to
avoid
inquiries
and
to
realize
all
that
had
passed
in
the
last
wonderful
three
hours
he
slipped
away
while
they
were
getting
her
into
the
carriage
and
wandered
back
into
the
wood
pausing
at
each
of
their
halting
places
at
last
he
reached
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
here
his
cup
of
happiness
was
likely
to
brim
over
for
he
found
the
mangled
little
boot
and
the
cut
lace
and
securing
the
precious
prize
hurried
back
home
to
be
in
time
for
dinner
mary
did
not
come
down
but
katie
the
only
person
of
whom
he
dared
to
inquire
assured
him
that
she
was
doing
famously
the
dinner
was
very
embarrassing
and
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
answering
the
searching
inquiries
of
his
mother
and
porter
as
to
how
when
where
and
in
whose
presence
the
accident
had
happened
as
soon
as
the
ladies
rose
he
left
his
father
and
porter
over
their
old
port
and
politics
and
went
out
in
the
twilight
into
the
garden
burthened
with
the
weight
of
sweet
thought
he
felt
that
he
had
something
to
do
to
set
himself
quite
right
with
mary
he
must
speak
somehow
that
night
if
possible
or
he
should
not
be
comfortable
or
at
peace
with
his
conscience
there
were
lights
in
her
room
he
guessed
by
the
shadows
that
she
was
lying
on
a
couch
by
the
open
window
round
which
the
other
ladies
were
flitting
presently
lights
appeared
in
the
and
as
the
shutters
were
being
closed
he
saw
his
mother
and
porter
come
in
and
sit
down
near
the
fire
listening
intently
he
heard
katie
talking
in
a
low
voice
in
the
room
above
and
saw
her
head
against
the
light
as
she
sat
down
close
to
the
window
probably
at
the
head
of
the
couch
where
mary
was
lying
should
he
call
to
her
if
he
did
how
could
he
say
what
he
wanted
to
say
through
her
a
happy
thought
struck
him
he
turned
to
the
flowerbeds
hunted
about
and
gathered
a
bunch
of
heliotrope
hurried
up
to
his
room
took
the
sprig
of
heather
out
of
his
shooting
coat
tied
them
together
caught
up
a
reel
and
line
from
his
table
and
went
into
the
room
over
mary
he
threw
the
window
open
and
leaning
out
said
gently
katie
no
answer
he
repeated
the
name
louder
no
answer
still
and
leaning
out
yet
further
he
saw
that
the
window
had
been
shut
he
lowered
the
bunch
of
flowers
and
swinging
it
backwards
and
forward
made
it
strike
the
window
below
once
twice
at
the
third
stroke
he
heard
the
window
open
katie
he
whispered
again
is
that
you
yes
where
are
you
what
is
this
for
her
he
said
in
the
same
whisper
katie
untied
the
flowers
and
he
waited
a
few
moments
and
then
again
called
her
name
and
she
answered
has
she
the
flowers
he
asked
yes
and
she
sends
you
her
love
and
says
you
are
to
go
down
to
the
and
with
that
the
window
closed
and
he
went
down
with
a
lightened
conscience
into
the
and
after
joining
in
the
talk
by
the
fire
for
a
few
minutes
took
a
book
and
sat
down
at
the
further
side
of
the
table
whether
he
ever
knew
what
the
book
was
may
be
fairly
questioned
but
to
all
appearances
he
was
deep
in
the
perusal
of
it
till
the
tea
and
katie
arrived
and
the
gentlemen
from
the
then
he
tried
to
join
in
the
conversation
again
but
on
the
whole
life
was
a
burthen
to
him
that
night
till
he
could
get
fairly
away
to
his
own
room
and
commune
with
himself
gazing
at
the
yellow
harvest
moon
with
his
elbows
on
the
window
sill
the
ankle
got
well
very
quickly
and
mary
was
soon
going
about
with
a
stick
which
had
belonged
to
father
and
a
limp
which
tom
thought
the
most
beautiful
movement
he
had
ever
seen
but
though
she
was
about
again
by
no
amount
of
patient
vigilance
could
he
now
get
the
chance
of
speaking
to
her
alone
but
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
she
must
understand
him
if
he
had
spoken
he
could
have
made
himself
clearer
and
now
the
porters
visit
was
all
but
over
and
katie
and
her
father
left
for
englebourn
the
porters
were
to
follow
the
next
day
and
promised
to
drive
round
and
stop
at
the
rectory
for
lunch
tom
petitioned
for
a
seat
in
their
carriage
to
englebourn
he
had
been
devoting
himself
to
porter
ever
since
the
accident
and
had
told
her
a
good
deal
about
his
own
early
life
his
account
of
his
early
friendship
for
betty
and
her
son
and
the
renewal
of
it
on
the
day
he
left
barton
manor
had
interested
her
and
she
was
moreover
not
insensible
to
his
assiduous
and
respectful
attentions
to
herself
which
had
of
late
been
quite
marked
she
was
touched
too
at
his
anxiety
to
hear
all
about
her
boys
and
how
they
were
getting
on
at
school
so
on
the
whole
tom
was
in
high
favour
with
her
and
she
most
graciously
assented
to
his
occupying
the
fourth
seat
in
their
barouche
she
was
not
without
her
suspicions
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
with
him
but
his
behavior
had
been
so
discreet
that
she
had
no
immediate
fears
and
after
all
if
anything
should
come
of
it
some
years
hence
her
daughter
might
do
worse
in
the
meantime
she
would
see
plenty
of
society
in
london
where
porter
vocations
kept
him
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
they
reached
englebourn
after
a
pleasant
long
morning
drive
and
tom
stole
a
glance
at
mary
and
felt
that
she
understood
him
as
he
pointed
out
the
hawk
lynch
and
the
clump
of
scotch
firs
to
her
mother
and
told
how
you
might
see
barton
from
the
top
of
it
and
how
he
loved
the
place
and
the
old
trees
and
the
view
katie
was
at
the
door
ready
to
receive
them
and
carried
off
mary
and
porter
to
her
own
room
tom
walked
round
the
garden
with
porter
and
then
sat
in
the
and
felt
melancholy
he
roused
himself
however
when
the
ladies
came
down
and
luncheon
was
announced
mary
was
full
of
her
reminiscences
of
the
englebourn
people
and
especially
of
poor
winburn
and
her
son
in
whom
she
had
begun
to
take
a
deep
interest
perhaps
from
overhearing
some
of
tom
talk
to
her
mother
so
story
was
canvassed
again
and
katie
told
them
how
he
had
been
turned
out
of
his
cottage
and
how
anxious
she
was
as
to
what
would
come
of
it
and
is
he
going
to
marry
your
gardener
daughter
after
all
asked
porter
i
am
afraid
there
is
not
much
chance
of
it
said
katie
i
can
not
make
martha
out
is
she
at
home
katie
asked
mary
i
should
like
to
see
her
again
i
took
a
great
fancy
to
her
when
i
was
here
yes
she
is
at
the
lodge
we
will
walk
there
after
luncheon
so
it
was
settled
that
the
carriage
should
pick
them
up
at
the
lodge
and
soon
after
luncheon
while
the
horses
were
being
put
to
the
whole
party
started
for
the
lodge
after
saying
to
winter
who
retired
to
his
room
much
fatigued
by
his
unwonted
hospitality
old
simon
wife
answered
their
knock
at
the
lodge
door
and
they
all
entered
and
porter
paid
her
compliments
on
the
cleanliness
of
the
room
then
mary
said
is
your
daughter
at
home
mrs
gibbons
ees
miss
someweres
handy
replied
gibbons
her
been
gone
out
not
dree
minnit
i
should
like
so
much
to
say
to
her
said
mary
we
shall
be
leaving
barton
soon
and
i
shall
not
see
her
again
till
next
summer
lor
miss
is
werry
good
said
the
old
dame
very
proud
set
down
then
while
i
gees
her
a
call
and
with
that
she
hurried
out
of
the
door
which
led
through
the
back
kitchen
into
the
little
yard
behind
the
lodge
and
the
next
moment
they
heard
her
calling
out
patty
patty
wher
bist
got
to
come
in
and
see
the
gentlefolk
the
name
which
the
old
woman
was
calling
out
made
tom
start
i
thought
you
said
her
name
was
martha
said
porter
patty
is
short
for
martha
in
berkshire
said
katie
laughing
and
patty
is
such
a
pretty
name
i
wonder
you
do
call
her
patty
said
mary
we
had
a
housemaid
of
the
same
name
a
year
or
two
ago
and
it
made
such
a
confusion
and
when
one
once
gets
used
to
a
name
it
is
so
hard
to
change
so
she
has
always
been
called
martha
well
i
all
for
patty
do
you
think
so
said
mary
turning
to
tom
the
sudden
introduction
of
a
name
which
he
had
such
reasons
for
remembering
the
memories
and
fears
which
it
called
up
above
all
the
bewilderment
which
he
felt
at
hearing
it
tossed
about
and
canvassed
by
mary
in
his
presence
as
if
there
were
nothing
more
in
it
than
in
any
other
name
confused
him
so
that
he
floundered
and
blundered
in
his
attempt
to
answer
and
at
last
gave
it
up
altogether
she
was
surprised
and
looked
at
him
inquiringly
his
eyes
fell
before
hers
and
he
turned
away
to
the
window
and
looked
at
the
carriage
which
had
just
drawn
up
at
the
lodge
door
he
had
scarcely
time
to
think
how
foolish
he
was
to
be
so
moved
when
he
heard
the
door
open
again
and
the
old
woman
and
her
daughter
come
in
he
turned
round
sharply
and
there
on
the
floor
of
the
room
courtseying
to
the
ladies
stood
the
of
the
choughs
his
first
impulse
was
to
hurry
away
she
was
looking
down
and
he
might
not
be
recognized
his
next
to
stand
his
ground
and
take
whatever
might
come
mary
went
up
to
her
and
took
her
hand
saying
that
she
could
not
go
away
without
coming
to
see
her
patty
looked
up
to
answer
and
glancing
round
the
room
caught
sight
of
him
he
stepped
forward
and
then
stopped
and
tried
to
speak
but
no
words
would
come
patty
looked
at
him
dropped
mary
hand
blushed
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
as
she
looked
timidly
round
at
the
wondering
spectators
and
putting
her
hands
to
her
face
ran
out
of
the
back
door
again
lawk
a
massy
what
ever
can
ha
cum
to
our
patty
said
gibbons
following
her
out
i
think
we
had
better
go
said
porter
giving
his
arm
to
his
daughter
and
leading
her
to
the
door
goodbye
katie
shall
we
see
you
again
at
barton
i
do
know
uncle
katie
answered
following
with
porter
in
a
state
of
sad
bewilderment
tom
with
his
brain
swimming
got
out
a
few
stammering
farewell
words
which
and
porter
received
with
marked
coldness
as
they
stepped
into
their
carriage
mary
face
was
flushed
and
uneasy
but
at
her
he
scarcely
dared
to
steal
a
look
and
to
her
was
quite
unable
to
speak
a
word
then
the
carriage
drove
off
and
he
turned
and
found
katie
standing
at
his
side
her
eyes
full
of
serious
wonder
his
fell
before
them
my
dear
tom
she
said
what
is
all
this
i
thought
you
had
never
seen
martha
so
i
thought
i
do
know
i
ca
talk
now
i
explain
all
to
you
do
think
very
badly
of
me
katie
god
bless
you
with
which
words
he
strode
away
while
she
looked
after
him
with
increasing
wonder
and
then
turned
and
went
into
the
lodge
he
hastened
away
from
the
rectory
and
down
the
village
street
taking
the
road
home
mechanically
but
otherwise
wholly
unconscious
of
roads
and
men
david
who
was
very
anxious
to
speak
to
him
about
harry
stood
at
his
door
making
signs
to
him
to
stop
in
vain
and
then
gave
chase
calling
out
after
him
till
he
saw
that
all
attempts
to
attract
his
notice
were
useless
and
so
ambled
back
to
his
much
troubled
in
mind
the
first
object
which
recalled
tom
at
all
to
himself
was
the
little
white
cottage
looking
out
of
englebourn
copse
towards
the
village
in
which
he
had
sat
by
poor
betty
the
garden
was
already
getting
wild
and
tangled
and
the
house
seemed
uninhabited
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
it
with
bitter
searchings
of
heart
here
was
the
place
where
he
had
taken
such
a
good
turn
as
he
had
fondly
hoped
in
connection
with
the
then
inmates
of
which
he
had
made
the
strongest
good
resolutions
he
had
ever
made
in
his
life
perhaps
what
was
the
good
of
his
trying
to
befriend
anybody
his
friendship
turned
to
a
blight
whatever
he
had
as
yet
tried
to
do
for
harry
had
only
injured
him
and
now
how
did
they
stand
could
they
ever
be
friends
again
after
that
day
discovery
to
do
him
justice
the
probable
ruin
of
all
his
own
prospects
the
sudden
coldness
of
and
porter
looks
and
mary
averted
face
were
not
the
things
he
thought
of
first
and
did
not
trouble
him
most
he
thought
of
harry
and
shuddered
at
the
wrong
he
had
done
him
as
he
looked
at
his
deserted
home
the
door
opened
and
a
figure
appeared
it
was
wurley
agent
the
lawyer
who
had
been
employed
by
farmer
tester
in
his
contest
with
harry
and
his
mates
about
the
pound
the
man
of
law
saluted
him
with
a
smirk
of
scarcely
concealed
triumph
and
then
turned
into
the
house
again
and
shut
the
door
as
if
he
did
not
consider
further
communication
necessary
or
safe
tom
turned
with
a
muttered
imprecation
on
him
and
his
master
and
hurried
away
along
the
lane
which
led
to
the
heath
the
hawk
lynch
lay
above
him
and
he
climbed
the
side
mechanically
and
sat
himself
again
on
the
old
spot
he
sat
for
some
time
looking
over
the
landscape
graven
on
his
mind
as
it
was
by
his
former
visit
and
bitterly
oh
how
bitterly
did
the
remembrance
of
that
visit
and
of
the
exultation
and
triumph
which
then
filled
him
and
carried
him
away
over
the
heath
with
a
shout
towards
his
home
come
back
on
him
he
could
look
out
from
his
watchtower
no
longer
and
lay
down
with
his
face
between
his
hands
on
the
turf
and
groaned
as
he
lay
but
his
good
angel
seemed
to
haunt
the
place
and
soon
the
cold
fit
began
to
pass
away
and
better
and
more
hopeful
thoughts
to
return
after
all
what
had
he
done
since
his
last
visit
to
that
place
to
be
ashamed
of
nothing
his
attempts
to
do
harry
service
unlucky
as
they
had
proved
had
been
honest
had
he
become
less
worthy
of
the
love
which
had
first
consciously
mastered
him
there
some
four
weeks
ago
no
he
felt
on
the
contrary
that
it
had
already
raised
him
and
purified
him
and
made
a
man
of
him
but
this
last
discovery
how
could
he
ever
get
over
that
well
after
all
the
facts
were
just
the
same
as
before
only
now
they
had
come
out
it
was
right
that
they
should
have
come
out
better
for
him
and
for
everyone
that
they
should
be
known
and
faced
he
was
ready
to
face
them
to
abide
any
consequences
that
they
might
now
bring
in
their
train
his
heart
was
right
towards
mary
towards
patty
towards
harry
that
he
felt
sure
of
and
if
so
why
should
he
despair
of
either
his
love
or
his
friendship
coming
to
a
good
end
and
so
he
sat
up
again
and
looked
out
bravely
towards
barton
and
began
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
his
eye
rested
on
the
rectory
that
was
the
first
place
to
begin
with
he
must
set
himself
right
with
katie
let
her
know
the
whole
story
through
her
he
could
reach
all
the
rest
and
do
whatever
must
be
done
to
clear
the
ground
and
start
fresh
again
at
first
he
thought
of
returning
to
her
at
once
and
rose
to
go
down
to
englebourn
but
anything
like
retracing
his
steps
was
utterly
distasteful
to
him
just
then
before
him
he
saw
light
dim
enough
as
yet
but
still
a
dawning
towards
that
he
would
press
leaving
everything
behind
him
to
take
care
of
itself
so
he
turned
northwards
and
struck
across
the
heath
at
his
best
pace
the
violent
exercise
almost
finished
his
cure
and
his
thoughts
became
clearer
and
more
hopeful
as
he
neared
home
he
arrived
there
as
the
household
was
going
to
bed
and
found
a
letter
waiting
for
him
it
was
from
hardy
saying
that
blake
had
left
him
and
he
was
now
thinking
of
returning
to
oxford
and
would
come
for
his
long
talked
of
visit
to
berkshire
if
tom
was
still
at
home
and
in
the
mind
to
receive
him
never
was
a
letter
more
opportune
here
was
the
tried
friend
on
whom
he
could
rely
for
help
and
advice
and
sympathy
who
knew
all
the
facts
too
from
beginning
to
end
his
father
and
mother
were
delighted
to
hear
that
they
should
now
see
the
friend
of
whom
he
had
spoken
so
much
so
he
went
up
stairs
and
wrote
an
answer
which
set
hardy
to
work
packing
his
portmanteau
in
the
far
west
and
brought
him
speedily
to
the
side
of
his
friend
under
the
lee
of
the
berkshire
hills
chapter
xxxv
second
year
for
some
days
after
his
return
home
in
fact
until
his
arrival
tom
was
thoroughly
beaten
down
and
wretched
notwithstanding
his
efforts
to
look
hopefully
forward
and
keep
up
his
spirits
his
usual
occupations
were
utterly
distasteful
to
him
and
instead
of
occupying
himself
he
sat
brooding
over
his
late
misfortune
and
hopelessly
puzzling
his
head
as
to
what
he
could
do
to
set
matters
right
the
conviction
in
which
he
always
landed
was
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
that
he
was
a
desolate
and
blighted
being
deserted
of
gods
and
men
presence
and
company
soon
shook
him
out
of
this
maudlin
nightmare
state
and
he
began
to
recover
as
soon
as
he
had
his
old
friend
to
hold
on
to
and
consult
with
their
consultations
were
held
chiefly
in
the
intervals
of
woodcraft
in
which
they
spent
most
of
their
hours
between
breakfast
and
dinner
hardy
did
not
take
out
a
certificate
and
would
shoot
without
one
so
as
the
best
autumn
exercise
they
selected
a
tough
old
pollard
elm
infinitely
ugly
with
knotted
and
twisted
roots
curiously
difficult
to
get
at
and
cut
through
which
had
been
long
marked
as
a
blot
by
brown
and
condemned
to
be
felled
as
soon
as
there
was
nothing
more
pressing
for
his
men
to
do
but
there
was
always
something
of
more
importance
so
that
the
old
tree
might
have
remained
until
this
day
had
not
hardy
and
tom
pitched
on
him
as
a
foeman
worthy
of
their
axes
they
shoveled
and
picked
and
hewed
away
with
great
energy
the
woodman
who
visited
them
occasionally
and
who
on
examining
their
first
efforts
had
remarked
that
the
severed
roots
looked
a
little
as
tho
the
dogs
had
been
a
gnawin
at
began
to
hold
them
in
respect
and
to
tender
his
advice
with
some
deference
by
the
time
the
tree
was
felled
and
shrouded
tom
was
in
a
convalescent
state
their
occupation
had
naturally
led
to
discussions
on
the
advantages
of
emigration
the
delights
of
clearing
one
own
estate
building
one
own
house
and
getting
away
from
conventional
life
with
a
few
tried
friends
of
course
the
pictures
which
were
painted
included
foregrounds
with
beautiful
children
playing
about
the
clearing
and
graceful
women
wives
of
the
happy
squatters
flitting
in
and
out
of
log
houses
and
sheds
clothed
and
occupied
after
the
manner
of
our
ideal
grandmothers
with
the
health
and
strength
of
amazons
the
refinement
of
ladies
and
wondrous
skill
in
all
domestic
works
confections
and
contrivances
the
would
also
contain
fascinating
select
libraries
continually
reinforced
from
home
sufficient
to
keep
all
the
dwellers
in
the
happy
clearing
in
communion
with
all
the
highest
minds
of
their
own
and
former
generations
wonderous
games
in
the
neighbouring
forest
dear
old
home
customs
established
and
taking
root
in
the
wilderness
with
ultimate
dainty
flower
gardens
conservatories
and
pianofortes
a
millennium
on
a
small
scale
with
universal
education
competence
prosperity
and
equal
rights
such
as
an
accompaniment
to
the
hard
exercise
of
woodcraft
worked
wonders
for
tom
in
the
next
week
and
may
be
safely
recommended
to
parties
in
like
evil
case
with
him
but
more
practical
discussions
were
not
neglected
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
make
a
day
at
englebourn
together
before
their
return
to
oxford
hardy
undertaking
to
invade
the
rectory
with
the
view
of
his
friend
character
there
tom
wrote
a
letter
to
katie
to
prepare
her
for
a
visit
the
day
after
the
ancient
elm
was
fairly
disposed
of
they
started
early
for
englebourn
and
separated
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
hardy
proceeding
to
the
rectory
to
fulfill
his
mission
which
he
felt
to
be
rather
an
embarrassing
one
and
tom
to
look
after
the
constable
or
whoever
else
could
give
him
information
about
harry
he
arrived
at
the
red
lion
their
appointed
trysting
place
before
hardy
and
spent
a
restless
in
the
porch
and
bar
waiting
for
his
return
at
last
hardy
came
and
tom
hurried
him
into
the
inn
best
room
where
bread
and
cheese
and
ale
awaited
them
and
as
soon
as
the
hostess
could
be
got
out
of
the
room
began
impatiently
well
you
have
seen
her
yes
i
have
come
straight
here
from
the
rectory
and
is
it
all
right
eh
has
she
got
my
letter
yes
she
had
had
your
letter
and
you
think
she
is
satisfied
satisfied
no
you
ca
expect
her
to
be
satisfied
i
mean
is
she
satisfied
that
it
is
so
bad
after
all
as
it
looked
the
other
day
what
does
katie
think
of
me
i
think
she
is
still
very
fond
of
you
but
that
she
has
been
puzzled
and
outraged
by
this
discovery
and
can
not
get
over
it
all
at
once
why
did
you
tell
her
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
i
tried
to
do
so
as
well
as
i
could
oh
but
i
can
see
you
have
done
it
she
does
really
understand
how
it
is
perhaps
not
but
you
must
remember
it
is
an
awkward
subject
to
be
talking
about
to
a
young
woman
i
would
sooner
stand
another
fellowship
examination
than
go
through
it
again
thank
you
old
fellow
said
tom
laying
his
hand
on
shoulder
i
feel
that
i
unreasonable
and
impatient
but
you
can
excuse
it
you
know
that
i
do
mean
it
do
say
another
word
i
only
wish
i
could
have
done
more
for
you
but
what
do
you
suppose
katie
thinks
of
me
why
you
see
it
sums
itself
up
in
this
she
sees
that
you
have
been
making
serious
love
to
patty
and
have
turned
the
poor
girl
head
more
or
less
and
that
now
you
are
in
love
with
somebody
else
why
put
it
how
we
will
we
ca
get
out
of
that
there
are
the
facts
pure
and
simple
and
she
would
be
half
a
woman
if
she
did
resent
it
but
it
hard
lines
too
is
it
old
fellow
no
i
wo
say
that
i
deserve
it
all
and
much
worse
but
you
think
i
may
come
round
all
right
yes
all
in
good
time
i
hope
there
no
danger
in
any
other
quarter
goodness
knows
there
the
rub
you
see
she
will
go
back
to
town
disgusted
with
me
i
see
her
again
and
she
hear
of
me
for
i
do
know
how
long
and
she
will
be
meeting
heaps
of
men
has
katie
been
over
to
barton
yes
she
was
there
last
week
just
before
they
left
well
what
happened
she
would
say
much
but
i
gathered
that
they
are
very
well
oh
yes
bother
it
of
course
they
are
very
well
but
did
she
talk
to
katie
about
what
happened
last
week
of
couse
they
did
what
else
should
they
talk
about
but
you
do
know
what
they
said
no
but
you
may
depend
on
it
that
miss
winter
will
be
your
friend
my
dear
fellow
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
time
well
i
suppose
not
said
tom
with
a
groan
do
you
think
i
should
call
and
see
katie
no
i
think
better
not
well
then
we
may
as
well
get
back
said
tom
who
was
not
sorry
for
his
friend
decision
so
they
paid
their
bill
and
started
for
home
taking
the
hawk
lynch
on
the
way
that
hardy
might
see
the
view
and
what
did
you
find
out
about
young
winburn
he
said
as
they
passed
down
the
street
oh
no
good
said
tom
he
was
turned
out
as
i
thought
and
has
gone
to
live
with
an
old
woman
on
the
heath
here
who
is
no
better
than
she
should
be
and
none
of
the
farmers
will
employ
him
you
did
see
him
i
suppose
no
he
is
away
with
some
of
the
heath
people
hawking
besoms
and
chairs
about
the
country
they
make
them
when
there
is
no
harvest
work
and
loaf
about
in
oxfordshire
and
buckinghamshire
and
other
counties
selling
them
no
good
will
come
of
that
sort
of
life
i
afraid
no
but
what
is
he
to
do
i
called
at
the
lodge
as
i
came
away
and
saw
patty
and
her
mother
it
all
right
in
that
quarter
the
old
woman
seem
to
think
anything
of
it
and
patty
is
a
good
girl
and
will
make
harry
winburn
or
anybody
else
a
capital
wife
here
are
your
letters
and
the
locket
i
quite
forgot
it
why
did
you
remind
me
of
it
you
talked
of
nothing
but
the
letters
this
morning
i
glad
of
it
it
can
do
no
harm
now
and
as
it
is
worth
something
i
should
have
been
ashamed
to
take
it
back
i
hope
she
put
harry
hair
in
it
soon
did
she
seem
to
mind
giving
up
the
letters
not
very
much
no
you
are
lucky
there
she
will
get
over
it
but
you
told
her
that
i
am
her
friend
for
life
and
that
she
is
to
let
me
know
if
i
can
ever
do
anything
for
her
yes
and
now
i
hope
this
is
the
last
job
of
the
kind
i
shall
ever
have
to
do
for
you
but
what
bad
luck
it
has
been
if
i
had
only
seen
her
before
or
known
who
she
was
nothing
of
all
this
would
have
happened
to
this
hardy
made
no
reply
and
the
subject
was
not
alluded
to
again
in
their
walk
home
a
day
or
two
afterwards
they
returned
to
oxford
hardy
to
begin
his
work
as
fellow
and
of
the
college
and
tom
to
see
whether
he
could
not
make
a
better
hand
of
his
second
year
than
he
had
of
his
first
he
began
with
a
much
better
chance
of
doing
so
for
he
was
thoroughly
humbled
the
discovery
that
he
was
not
altogether
such
a
hero
as
he
had
fancied
himself
had
dawned
upon
him
very
distinctly
by
the
end
of
his
first
year
and
the
events
of
the
long
vacation
had
confirmed
the
impression
and
pretty
well
taken
all
the
conceit
out
of
him
for
the
time
the
impotency
of
his
own
will
even
when
he
was
bent
on
doing
the
right
thing
his
want
of
insight
and
foresight
in
whatever
matter
he
took
in
hand
the
unruliness
of
his
temper
and
passions
just
at
the
moments
when
it
behooved
him
to
have
them
most
thoroughly
in
hand
and
under
control
were
a
set
of
disagreeable
facts
which
had
been
driven
well
home
to
him
the
results
being
even
such
as
we
have
seen
he
did
not
much
repine
at
for
he
felt
he
had
deserved
them
and
there
was
a
sort
of
grim
satisfaction
dreary
as
the
prospect
was
in
facing
them
and
taking
his
punishment
like
a
man
this
was
what
he
had
felt
at
the
first
blush
on
the
hawk
lynch
and
as
he
thought
over
matters
again
by
his
fire
with
his
oak
sported
on
the
first
evening
of
term
he
was
still
in
the
same
mind
this
was
clearly
what
he
had
to
do
now
how
to
do
it
was
the
only
question
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
try
to
set
himself
right
with
the
porters
and
the
englebourn
circle
by
writing
further
explanations
and
confessions
to
katie
but
on
trying
his
hand
at
a
letter
he
found
that
he
could
not
trust
himself
the
temptation
of
putting
everything
in
the
best
point
of
view
for
himself
was
too
great
so
he
gave
up
the
attempt
and
merely
wrote
a
few
lines
to
david
to
remind
him
that
he
was
always
ready
and
anxious
to
do
all
he
could
for
his
friend
harry
winburn
and
to
beg
that
he
might
have
news
of
anything
which
happened
to
him
and
how
he
was
getting
on
he
did
not
allude
to
what
had
lately
happened
for
he
did
not
know
whether
the
facts
had
become
known
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
open
the
subject
himself
having
finished
his
letter
he
turned
again
to
his
meditations
over
the
fire
and
considering
that
he
had
some
little
right
to
reward
resolution
took
off
the
safety
valve
and
allowed
the
thoughts
to
bubble
up
freely
which
were
always
underlying
all
others
that
passed
through
his
brain
and
making
constant
low
delicious
but
just
now
somewhat
melancholy
music
in
his
head
and
heart
he
gave
himself
up
to
thinking
of
mary
and
their
walk
in
the
wood
and
the
sprained
ankle
and
all
the
sayings
and
doings
of
that
eventful
autumn
day
and
then
he
opened
his
desk
and
examined
certain
treasures
therein
concealed
including
a
withered
a
sprig
of
heather
a
cut
and
a
scrap
or
two
of
writing
having
gone
through
some
extravagant
forms
of
worship
not
necessary
to
be
specified
he
put
them
away
would
it
ever
all
come
right
he
made
his
solitary
tea
and
sat
down
again
to
consider
the
point
but
the
point
would
not
be
considered
alone
he
began
to
feel
more
strongly
what
he
had
had
several
hints
of
already
that
there
was
a
curiously
close
connexion
between
his
own
love
story
and
that
of
harry
winburn
and
patty
that
he
could
separate
them
even
in
his
thoughts
old
simon
tumble
which
had
recalled
his
daughter
from
oxford
at
so
critical
a
moment
for
him
mary
visit
to
englebourn
at
this
very
time
the
curious
yet
natural
series
of
little
accidents
which
had
kept
him
in
ignorance
of
patty
identity
until
the
final
catastrophe
then
again
the
way
in
which
harry
winburn
and
his
mother
had
come
across
him
on
the
very
day
of
his
leaving
barton
the
fellowship
of
a
common
mourning
which
had
seemed
to
bind
them
together
so
closely
and
this
last
discovery
which
he
could
not
help
fearing
must
turn
harry
into
a
bitter
enemy
when
he
heard
the
truth
as
he
must
sooner
or
later
as
all
these
things
passed
before
him
he
gave
in
to
a
sort
of
superstitious
feeling
that
his
own
fate
hung
in
some
way
or
another
upon
that
of
harry
winburn
if
he
helped
on
his
suit
he
was
helping
on
his
own
but
whether
he
helped
on
his
own
or
not
was
after
all
not
that
which
was
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
he
was
much
changed
in
this
respect
since
he
last
sat
in
those
rooms
just
after
his
first
days
with
her
since
then
an
angel
had
met
him
and
had
touched
the
cord
of
self
which
trembling
was
passing
in
music
out
of
sight
the
thought
of
harry
and
his
trials
enabled
him
to
indulge
in
some
good
honest
indignation
for
which
there
was
no
room
in
his
own
case
that
the
prospects
in
life
of
such
a
man
should
be
in
the
power
to
a
great
extent
of
such
people
as
squire
wurley
and
farmer
tester
that
because
he
happened
to
be
poor
he
should
be
turned
out
of
the
cottage
where
his
family
had
lived
for
a
hundred
years
at
a
week
notice
through
the
caprice
of
a
drunken
gambler
that
because
he
had
stood
up
for
his
rights
and
had
thereby
offended
the
worst
farmer
in
the
parish
he
should
be
a
marked
man
and
unable
to
get
work
these
things
appeared
so
monstrous
to
tom
and
made
him
so
angry
that
he
was
obliged
to
get
up
and
stamp
about
the
room
and
from
the
particular
case
he
very
soon
got
to
generalizations
questions
which
had
before
now
puzzled
him
gained
a
new
significance
every
minute
and
became
real
to
him
why
a
few
men
should
be
rich
and
all
the
rest
poor
above
all
why
he
should
be
one
of
the
few
why
the
mere
possession
of
property
should
give
a
man
power
over
all
his
neighbors
why
poor
men
who
were
ready
and
willing
to
work
should
only
be
allowed
to
work
as
a
sort
of
favor
and
should
after
all
get
the
merest
tithe
of
what
their
labor
produced
and
be
tossed
aside
as
soon
as
their
work
was
done
or
no
longer
required
these
and
other
such
problems
rose
up
before
him
crude
and
sharp
asking
to
be
solved
feeling
himself
quite
unable
to
give
any
but
one
answer
to
them
viz
that
he
was
getting
out
of
his
depth
and
that
the
whole
business
was
in
a
muddle
he
had
recourse
to
his
old
method
when
in
difficulties
and
putting
on
his
cap
started
off
to
rooms
to
talk
the
matter
over
and
see
whether
he
could
not
get
some
light
on
it
from
that
quarter
he
returned
in
an
hour
or
so
somewhat
less
troubled
in
his
mind
inasmuch
as
he
had
found
his
friend
in
pretty
much
the
same
state
of
mind
on
such
topics
as
himself
but
one
step
he
had
gained
under
his
arm
he
carried
certain
books
from
hardy
scanty
library
the
perusal
of
which
he
hoped
at
least
might
enable
him
sooner
or
later
to
feel
that
he
had
got
on
to
some
sort
of
firm
ground
at
any
rate
hardy
had
advised
him
to
read
them
so
without
more
ado
he
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
and
began
to
look
into
them
this
glimpse
of
the
manner
in
which
tom
spent
the
first
evening
of
his
second
year
at
oxford
will
enable
intelligent
readers
to
understand
why
though
he
took
to
reading
far
more
kindly
and
honestly
than
he
had
ever
done
before
he
made
no
great
advance
in
the
proper
studies
of
the
place
not
that
he
wholly
neglected
these
for
hardy
kept
him
pretty
well
up
to
the
collar
and
he
passed
his
little
go
creditably
and
was
fairly
placed
at
the
college
examinations
in
some
of
the
books
which
he
had
to
get
up
for
lectures
he
was
genuinely
interested
the
politics
of
athens
the
struggle
between
the
roman
plebs
and
patricians
mons
sacer
and
the
agrarian
laws
these
began
to
have
a
new
meaning
to
him
but
chiefly
because
they
bore
more
or
less
on
the
great
harry
winburn
problem
which
problem
indeed
for
him
had
now
fairly
swelled
into
the
problem
and
was
becoming
every
day
more
and
more
urgent
and
importunate
shaking
many
old
beliefs
and
leading
him
whither
he
knew
not
this
very
matter
of
leading
was
a
sore
trial
to
him
the
further
he
got
on
his
new
road
the
more
he
felt
the
want
of
guidance
the
guidance
of
some
man
for
that
of
books
he
soon
found
to
be
bewildering
his
college
tutor
whom
he
consulted
only
deprecated
the
waste
of
tune
but
on
finding
it
impossible
to
dissuade
him
at
last
recommended
the
economic
works
of
that
day
as
the
proper
well
springs
of
truth
on
such
matters
to
them
tom
accordingly
went
and
read
with
the
docility
and
faith
of
youth
bent
on
learning
and
feeling
itself
in
the
presence
of
men
who
had
or
assumed
the
right
of
speaking
with
authority
and
they
spoke
to
him
with
authority
and
he
read
on
believing
much
and
hoping
more
but
somehow
they
did
not
really
satisfy
him
though
they
silenced
him
for
the
time
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
books
most
of
which
laid
down
clearly
enough
that
what
they
professed
to
teach
was
the
science
of
man
material
interests
and
the
laws
of
the
making
and
employment
of
capital
but
this
escaped
him
in
his
eagerness
and
he
wandered
up
and
down
their
pages
in
search
of
quite
another
science
and
of
laws
with
which
they
did
not
meddle
nevertheless
here
and
there
they
seemed
to
touch
upon
what
he
was
in
search
of
he
was
much
fascinated
for
instance
by
the
doctrine
of
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
and
for
its
sake
swallowed
for
a
time
though
not
without
wry
faces
the
dogmas
that
is
the
true
pivot
of
all
social
action
that
population
has
a
perpetual
tendency
to
outstrip
the
means
of
living
and
that
to
establish
a
preventive
check
on
population
is
the
duty
of
all
good
citizens
and
so
he
lived
on
for
some
time
in
a
dreary
uncomfortable
state
fearing
for
the
future
of
his
country
and
with
little
hope
about
his
own
but
when
he
came
to
take
stock
of
his
newly
acquired
knowledge
to
weigh
it
and
measure
it
and
found
it
to
consist
of
a
sort
of
hazy
conviction
that
society
would
be
all
right
and
ready
for
the
millennium
when
every
man
could
do
what
he
liked
and
nobody
could
interfere
with
him
and
there
should
be
a
law
against
marriage
the
result
was
more
than
he
could
stand
he
roused
himself
and
shook
himself
and
began
to
think
well
these
my
present
teachers
are
very
clever
men
and
men
too
i
see
all
that
but
if
their
teaching
is
only
to
land
me
here
why
it
was
scarcely
worth
while
going
through
so
much
to
get
so
little
casting
about
still
for
guidance
grey
occurred
to
him
grey
was
in
residence
as
a
bachelor
attending
divinity
lectures
and
preparing
for
ordination
he
was
still
working
hard
at
the
and
tom
had
been
there
once
or
twice
to
help
him
when
the
curate
was
away
in
short
he
was
in
very
good
books
with
grey
who
had
got
the
better
of
his
shyness
with
him
he
saw
that
tom
was
changed
and
sobered
and
in
his
heart
hoped
some
day
to
wean
him
from
the
pursuits
of
the
body
to
which
he
was
still
fearfully
addicted
and
to
bring
him
into
the
fold
this
hope
was
not
altogether
unfounded
for
notwithstanding
the
strong
bias
against
them
which
tom
had
brought
with
him
from
school
he
was
now
at
times
much
attracted
by
many
of
the
high
church
doctrines
and
the
men
who
professed
them
such
men
as
grey
he
saw
did
really
believe
something
and
were
in
earnest
about
carrying
their
beliefs
into
action
the
party
might
and
did
comprise
many
others
of
the
weakest
sort
who
believed
and
were
in
earnest
about
nothing
but
who
liked
to
be
peculiar
nevertheless
while
he
saw
it
laying
hold
of
many
of
the
best
men
of
his
time
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
was
drawn
towards
it
some
help
might
lie
in
these
men
if
he
could
only
get
at
it
so
he
propounded
his
doubts
and
studies
and
their
results
to
grey
but
it
was
a
failure
grey
felt
no
difficulty
or
very
little
in
the
whole
matter
but
tom
found
that
it
was
because
he
believed
the
world
to
belong
to
the
devil
buying
cheap
and
selling
dear
grey
held
might
be
good
enough
for
laws
for
the
world
very
probably
were
the
laws
of
the
church
were
and
bearing
one
another
burdens
her
children
should
come
out
from
the
regions
where
the
laws
were
acknowledged
tom
listened
was
dazzled
at
first
and
thought
he
was
getting
on
the
right
track
but
very
soon
he
found
that
grey
specific
was
not
of
the
least
use
to
him
it
was
no
good
to
tell
him
of
the
rules
of
a
society
to
which
he
felt
that
he
neither
belonged
nor
wished
to
belong
for
clearly
it
could
not
be
the
church
of
england
he
was
an
outsider
grey
would
probably
admit
it
to
be
so
if
he
asked
him
he
had
no
longing
to
be
anything
else
the
church
meant
an
exclusive
body
which
took
no
care
of
any
but
its
own
people
and
had
nothing
to
say
to
the
great
world
in
which
he
and
most
people
had
to
live
and
buying
and
selling
and
hiring
and
working
had
to
go
on
the
close
corporation
might
have
very
good
laws
but
they
were
nothing
to
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
about
was
the
law
which
this
great
world
the
world
as
grey
called
it
was
ruled
by
or
rather
ought
to
be
ruled
by
perhaps
after
all
bentham
and
the
others
whose
books
he
had
been
reading
might
be
right
at
any
rate
it
was
clear
that
they
had
had
in
their
thoughts
the
same
world
that
he
had
the
world
which
included
himself
and
harry
winburn
and
all
labourers
and
squires
and
farmers
so
he
turned
to
them
again
not
hopefully
but
more
inclined
to
listen
to
them
than
he
had
been
before
he
had
spoken
to
grey
hardy
was
so
fully
occupied
with
college
lectures
and
private
pupils
that
tom
had
scruples
about
taking
up
much
of
his
spare
time
in
the
evenings
nevertheless
as
grey
had
broken
down
and
there
was
nobody
else
on
whose
judgment
he
could
rely
who
would
listen
to
him
whenever
he
had
a
chance
he
would
propound
some
of
his
puzzles
to
his
old
friend
in
some
respects
he
got
little
help
for
hardy
was
almost
as
much
at
sea
as
he
himself
on
such
subjects
as
value
and
wages
and
the
laws
of
supply
and
demand
but
there
was
an
indomitable
belief
in
him
that
all
men
intercourse
with
one
another
and
not
merely
that
of
churchmen
must
be
founded
on
the
principal
of
doing
as
they
would
be
done
by
and
not
on
buying
cheap
and
selling
dear
and
that
these
never
would
or
could
be
reconciled
with
one
another
or
mean
the
same
thing
twist
them
how
you
would
this
faith
of
his
friend
comforted
tom
greatly
and
he
was
never
tired
of
bringing
it
out
but
at
times
he
had
his
doubts
whether
grey
might
not
be
right
whether
after
all
that
and
the
like
maxims
and
principles
were
meant
to
be
the
laws
of
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
he
wanted
some
corroborative
evidence
on
the
subject
from
an
impartial
and
competent
witness
and
at
last
hit
upon
what
he
wanted
for
one
evening
on
entering
hardy
rooms
he
found
him
on
the
last
pages
of
a
book
which
he
shut
up
with
an
air
of
triumph
on
recognizing
his
visitor
taking
it
up
he
thrust
it
into
tom
hands
and
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
said
there
my
boy
that
what
we
want
or
pretty
near
it
at
any
rate
now
do
say
a
word
but
go
back
to
your
rooms
and
swallow
it
whole
and
digest
it
and
then
come
back
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
ca
talk
i
have
spent
the
better
part
of
two
days
over
that
book
and
have
no
end
of
papers
to
look
over
there
get
back
to
your
rooms
and
do
what
i
tell
you
or
sit
down
here
and
hold
your
tongue
so
tom
sat
down
and
held
his
tongue
and
was
soon
deep
in
carlyle
past
and
present
how
he
did
revel
in
it
in
the
humor
the
power
the
pathos
but
above
all
in
the
root
and
branch
denunciations
of
many
of
the
doctrines
in
which
he
had
been
so
lately
voluntarily
and
wearily
chaining
himself
the
chains
went
snapping
off
one
after
another
and
in
his
exultation
he
kept
spouting
out
passage
after
passage
in
a
song
of
triumph
enlightened
egoism
never
so
luminous
is
not
the
rule
by
which
man
life
can
be
led
supply
and
demand
cash
payment
for
the
sole
nexus
and
so
forth
were
not
are
not
and
never
will
be
a
practical
law
of
union
for
a
society
of
men
until
hardy
fairly
got
up
and
turned
him
out
and
he
retired
with
his
treasure
to
his
own
rooms
he
had
scarcely
ever
in
his
life
been
so
moved
by
a
book
before
he
laughed
over
it
and
cried
over
it
and
began
half
a
dozen
letters
to
the
author
to
thank
him
which
he
fortunately
tore
up
he
almost
forgot
mary
for
several
hours
during
his
first
enthusiasm
he
had
no
notion
how
he
had
been
mastered
and
oppressed
before
he
felt
as
the
crew
of
a
small
who
are
being
towed
away
by
an
enemy
cruiser
might
feel
on
seeing
a
frigate
with
the
union
jack
flying
bearing
down
and
opening
fire
on
their
captor
or
as
a
small
boy
at
school
who
is
being
fagged
against
rules
by
the
right
of
the
strongest
feels
when
he
sees
his
big
brother
coming
around
the
corner
the
help
which
he
had
found
was
just
what
he
wanted
there
was
no
narrowing
of
the
ground
here
no
appeal
to
men
as
members
of
any
exclusive
body
whatever
to
separate
themselves
and
come
out
of
the
devil
world
but
to
men
as
men
to
every
man
as
a
man
to
the
weakest
and
meanest
as
well
as
to
the
strongest
and
most
noble
telling
them
that
the
world
is
god
world
that
everyone
of
them
has
a
work
in
it
and
bidding
them
find
their
work
and
set
about
it
the
strong
tinge
of
sadness
which
ran
through
the
whole
book
and
its
unsparing
denunciations
of
the
established
order
of
things
suited
his
own
unsettled
and
restless
frame
of
mind
so
he
gave
himself
up
to
his
new
bondage
and
rejoiced
in
it
as
though
he
had
found
at
last
what
he
was
seeking
for
and
by
the
time
that
long
vacation
came
round
again
to
which
we
are
compelled
to
hurry
him
he
was
filled
full
of
a
set
of
contradictory
notions
and
beliefs
which
were
destined
to
astonish
and
perplex
the
mind
of
that
worthy
for
the
county
of
berks
brown
the
elder
whatever
other
effect
they
might
have
on
society
at
large
readers
must
not
suppose
however
that
our
hero
had
given
up
his
old
pursuits
on
the
contrary
he
continued
to
boat
and
cricket
and
spar
with
as
much
vigor
as
ever
his
perplexities
only
made
him
a
little
more
silent
at
his
pastimes
than
he
used
to
be
but
as
we
have
already
seen
him
thus
employed
and
know
the
ways
of
the
animal
in
such
matters
it
is
needless
to
repeat
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
follow
him
into
new
fields
of
thought
and
action
and
mark
if
it
may
be
how
he
develops
and
gets
himself
educated
in
one
way
and
another
and
this
plunge
into
the
great
sea
of
social
political
and
economical
questions
is
the
noticeable
fact
so
far
as
any
is
noticeable
of
his
second
year
residence
during
the
year
he
had
only
very
meagre
accounts
of
matters
at
englebourn
katie
indeed
had
come
round
sufficiently
to
write
to
him
but
she
scarcely
alluded
to
her
cousin
he
only
knew
that
mary
had
come
out
in
london
and
was
much
admired
and
that
the
porters
had
not
taken
barton
again
but
were
going
abroad
for
the
autumn
and
winter
the
accounts
of
harry
were
bad
he
was
still
living
at
daddy
collins
nobody
knew
how
and
working
occasionally
with
the
outlaws
of
the
heath
the
only
fact
of
importance
in
the
neighborhood
had
been
the
death
of
squire
wurley
which
happened
suddenly
in
the
spring
a
distant
cousin
had
succeeded
him
a
young
man
of
tom
own
age
he
was
also
in
residence
at
oxford
and
tom
knew
him
they
were
not
very
congenial
so
he
was
much
astonished
when
young
wurley
on
his
return
to
college
after
his
relative
funeral
rather
sought
him
out
and
seemed
to
wish
to
know
more
of
him
the
end
of
it
was
an
invitation
to
tom
to
come
to
the
grange
and
spend
a
week
or
so
at
the
beginning
of
the
long
vacation
there
was
to
be
a
party
of
oxford
men
there
and
nobody
else
and
they
meant
to
enjoy
themselves
thoroughly
wurley
said
tom
felt
much
embarrassed
how
to
act
and
after
some
hesitation
told
his
inviter
of
his
last
visit
to
the
mansion
in
question
thinking
that
a
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
might
change
his
mind
but
he
found
that
young
wurley
knew
the
facts
already
and
in
fact
he
could
help
suspecting
that
his
quarrel
with
the
late
owner
had
something
to
say
to
his
present
invitation
however
it
did
not
lie
in
his
mouth
to
be
curious
on
the
subject
and
so
he
accepted
the
invitation
gladly
much
delighted
at
the
notion
of
beginning
his
vacation
so
near
englebourn
and
having
the
run
of
the
grange
fishing
which
was
justly
celebrated
chapter
xxxvi
the
river
side
so
from
henley
tom
went
home
just
to
see
his
father
and
mother
and
pick
up
his
and
then
started
for
the
grange
on
his
road
thither
he
more
than
once
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
go
round
by
englebourn
get
his
first
interview
with
katie
over
and
find
out
how
the
world
was
really
going
with
harry
and
his
sweetheart
of
whom
he
had
such
meagre
intelligence
of
late
but
for
some
reason
or
another
when
it
came
to
taking
the
turn
to
englebourn
he
passed
it
by
and
contenting
himself
for
the
time
with
a
distant
view
of
the
village
and
the
hawk
lynch
drove
straight
to
the
grange
he
had
not
expected
to
feel
very
comfortable
at
first
in
the
house
which
he
had
left
the
previous
autumn
in
so
strange
a
manner
and
he
was
not
disappointed
the
rooms
reminded
him
unpleasantly
of
his
passage
of
arms
with
the
late
master
and
the
grave
and
portly
butler
was
somewhat
embarrassed
in
his
reception
of
him
while
the
footman
who
carried
off
his
portmanteau
did
it
with
a
grin
which
put
him
out
the
set
of
men
whom
he
found
there
were
not
of
his
sort
they
were
young
londoners
and
he
a
thorough
countryman
but
the
sight
of
the
stream
by
which
he
took
a
hearty
stroll
before
dinner
made
up
for
everything
and
filled
him
with
pleasurable
anticipations
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
sweeter
bit
of
water
the
dinner
to
which
the
party
of
young
gentlemen
sat
down
was
most
undeniable
the
host
talked
a
little
too
much
perhaps
under
all
the
circumstances
of
wine
plate
mutton
provoking
the
thought
of
how
long
they
had
been
his
but
he
was
bent
on
hospitality
after
his
fashion
and
his
guests
were
not
disposed
to
criticize
much
the
old
butler
did
not
condescend
to
wait
but
brought
in
a
magnum
of
claret
after
dinner
carefully
nursing
it
as
if
it
were
a
baby
and
placing
it
patronizingly
before
his
young
master
before
they
adjourned
to
the
they
had
disposed
of
several
of
the
same
but
the
followers
were
brought
in
by
a
footman
the
butler
being
employed
in
discussing
a
bottle
of
an
older
vintage
with
the
steward
in
the
then
came
pool
pool
pool
and
brandy
and
cigars
into
the
short
hours
but
tom
stole
away
early
having
an
eye
to
his
fishing
and
not
feeling
much
at
home
with
his
companions
he
was
out
soon
after
sunrise
the
next
morning
he
never
wanted
to
be
called
when
there
was
a
within
reach
and
his
fishing
instinct
told
him
that
in
these
sultry
there
would
be
little
chance
of
sport
when
the
sun
was
well
up
so
he
let
himself
gently
out
of
the
hall
door
paused
a
moment
on
the
steps
to
fill
his
chest
with
the
fresh
morning
air
as
he
glanced
at
the
weathercock
over
the
stables
and
then
set
to
work
to
put
his
tackle
together
on
the
lawn
humming
a
tune
to
himself
as
he
selected
an
insinuating
red
hackle
and
alder
fly
from
his
book
and
tied
them
on
to
his
cast
then
he
slung
his
creel
over
his
shoulder
picked
up
his
rod
and
started
for
the
water
as
he
passed
the
gates
of
the
the
keeper
came
out
a
sturdy
fellow
in
a
velveteen
coat
and
cord
breeches
and
gaiters
and
touched
his
hat
tom
returned
the
salute
and
wished
him
good
morning
mornin
sir
you
be
about
early
yes
i
reckon
it
the
best
time
for
sport
at
the
end
of
june

so
sir
shall
i
fetch
a
net
and
come
along
no
thank
you
i
manage
the
ladle
myself
but
which
do
you
call
the
best
water
they

both
middling
good

much
odds
atwixt
but
i
see
most
fish
movin
o
mornin
in
the
deep
water
down
below
i
do
know
the
night
was
too
hot
said
tom
who
had
examined
the
water
the
day
before
and
made
up
his
mind
where
he
was
going
i
for
deep
water
on
cold
days
i
shall
begin
with
the
stickles
up
above
there

good
head
of
water

i
suppose

tom
stepped
off
brushing
through
the
steaming
long
grass
gemmed
with
wild
flowers
followed
by
the
keeper
and
as
the
grasshoppers
bounded
chirruping
out
of
his
way
and
the
insect
life
hummed
and
murmured
and
the
lark
rose
and
sang
above
his
head
he
felt
happier
than
he
had
done
for
many
a
long
month
so
his
heart
opened
towards
his
companion
who
kept
a
little
behind
him

nigh
that
there
off
bank
and
you
med
have
a
rare
good
un
ther
i
seen
a
fish
suck
there
just
now
as
war
spawned
this
year
nor
last
nether
and
away
went
the
communicative
keeper
stanch
fellow
the
keeper
said
tom
to
himself
as
he
reeled
out
yard
after
yard
of
his
tapered
line
and
with
a
gentle
sweep
dropped
his
collar
of
flies
lightly
on
the
water
each
cast
covering
another
five
feet
of
the
dimpling
surface
good
fellow
the
keeper
do
mind
telling
a
story
against
himself
can
stand
being
laughed
at
more
than
master
can
ah
there
the
fish
he
saw
sucking
i
be
bound
now
you
beauties
over
his
nose
and
fall
light
do
disgrace
your
bringing
up
and
away
went
the
flies
quivering
through
the
air
and
lighting
close
to
the
opposite
bank
under
a
bunch
of
rushes
a
slight
round
eddy
flowed
below
the
rushes
as
the
cast
came
gently
back
across
the
current
ah
you
see
them
do
you
old
boy
thought
tom
say
your
prayers
then
and
get
shrived
and
away
went
the
flies
again
this
time
a
little
below
no
movement
the
third
throw
a
great
lunge
and
splash
and
the
next
moment
the
lithe
rod
bent
double
and
the
gut
collar
spun
along
cutting
through
the
water
like
mad
up
goes
the
great
fish
twice
into
the
air
tom
giving
him
the
point
then
up
stream
again
tom
giving
him
the
butt
and
beginning
to
reel
up
gently
down
goes
the
great
fish
into
the
swaying
weeds
working
with
his
tail
like
a
screw
if
i
can
only
get
my
nose
to
ground
thinks
he
so
thinks
tom
and
trusts
to
his
tackle
keeping
a
steady
strain
on
trouty
and
creeping
gently
down
stream
no
go
says
the
fish
as
he
feels
his
nose
steadily
hauled
round
and
turns
a
swirl
downstream
away
goes
tom
reeling
in
and
away
goes
the
fish
in
hopes
of
a
slack
away
for
twenty
or
thirty
yards
the
fish
coming
to
the
top
lazily
and
again
and
holding
on
to
get
his
second
wind
now
a
cart
track
crosses
the
stream
no
weeds
and
shallow
water
at
the
side
here
we
must
have
it
out
thinks
tom
and
turns
fish
nose
up
stream
again
the
big
fish
gets
sulky
twice
drifts
towards
the
shallow
and
twice
plunges
away
at
the
sight
of
his
enemy
into
the
deep
water
the
third
time
he
comes
swaying
in
his
yellow
side
gleaming
and
his
mouth
open
and
the
next
moment
tom
scoops
him
out
onto
the
grass
with
a
whoop
that
might
have
been
heard
at
the
house
two
pounder
if
he
an
ounce
says
tom
as
he
gives
him
the
de
and
lays
him
out
lovingly
on
the
fresh
green
sward
who
amongst
you
dear
readers
can
appreciate
the
intense
delight
of
grassing
your
first
big
fish
after
a
nine
month
fast
all
first
sensations
have
their
special
pleasure
but
none
can
be
named
in
a
small
way
to
beat
this
of
the
first
fish
of
the
season
the
first
clean
for
four
in
your
first
match
at
lord
the
grating
of
the
bows
of
your
racing
boat
against
the
stern
of
the
boat
ahead
in
your
first
race
the
first
of
a
burst
from
the
cover
side
in
november
when
the
hounds
in
the
field
ahead
may
be
covered
with
a
and
no
one
but
the
huntsman
and
a
top
sawyer
or
two
lies
between
you
and
them
the
first
brief
after
your
call
to
the
bar
if
it
comes
within
the
year
the
sensations
produced
by
these
are
the
same
in
kind
but
cricket
boating
getting
briefs
even
hunting
lose
their
edge
as
time
goes
on
as
to
lady
readers
it
is
impossible
probably
to
give
them
an
idea
of
the
sensation
in
question
perhaps
some
may
have
experienced
something
of
the
kind
at
their
first
balls
when
they
heard
whispers
and
saw
all
eyes
turning
their
way
and
knew
that
their
dresses
and
gloves
fitted
perfectly
but
this
joy
can
be
felt
but
once
in
a
life
and
the
first
fish
comes
back
as
fresh
as
ever
or
ought
to
come
if
all
men
had
their
rights
once
in
a
season
so
good
luck
to
the
gentle
craft
and
its
professors
may
the
fates
send
us
much
into
their
company
the
trout
fisher
like
the
landscape
painter
haunts
the
loveliest
places
of
the
earth
and
haunts
them
alone
solitude
and
his
own
thoughts
he
must
be
on
the
best
terms
with
all
of
these
and
he
who
can
take
kindly
the
largest
allowance
of
these
is
likely
to
be
the
kindliest
and
truest
with
his
fellow
men
tom
had
splendid
sport
that
summer
morning
as
the
great
sun
rose
higher
the
light
morning
breeze
which
had
curled
the
water
died
away
the
light
mist
drew
up
into
light
cloud
and
the
light
cloud
vanished
into
cloudland
for
anything
i
know
and
still
the
fish
rose
strange
to
say
though
tom
felt
it
was
an
affair
of
minutes
and
acted
accordingly
at
eight
he
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
at
a
point
in
the
stream
of
rare
charms
both
for
the
angler
and
the
lover
of
gentle
river
beauty
the
main
stream
was
crossed
by
a
lock
formed
of
a
solid
brick
bridge
with
no
parapets
under
which
the
water
rushed
through
four
small
arches
each
of
which
could
be
closed
in
an
instant
by
letting
down
a
heavy
wooden
lock
gate
fitted
in
grooves
on
the
upper
side
of
the
bridge
such
locks
are
frequent
in
the
streams
even
at
long
distances
from
mills
and
millers
for
whose
behoof
they
were
made
in
old
days
that
the
supply
of
water
to
the
mill
might
be
easily
regulated
all
pious
anglers
should
bless
the
memories
of
the
old
builders
of
them
for
they
are
the
very
paradises
of
the
great
trout
who
frequent
the
old
brickwork
and
timber
foundations
the
water
in
its
rush
through
the
arches
had
of
course
worked
for
itself
a
deep
hole
and
then
some
twenty
yards
below
spread
itself
out
in
wanton
joyous
ripples
and
eddies
over
a
broad
surface
some
fifty
yards
across
and
dashed
away
towards
a
little
island
some
two
hundred
yards
below
or
rolled
itself
slowly
back
towards
the
bridge
again
up
the
backwater
by
the
side
of
the
bank
as
if
longing
for
another
merry
rush
through
one
of
those
narrow
arches
the
island
below
was
crowned
with
splendid
alders
willows
forty
feet
high
which
wept
into
the
water
and
two
or
three
poplars
a
rich
mile
of
water
meadow
with
an
occasional
willow
or
alder
lay
gleaming
beyond
and
the
view
was
bounded
by
a
glorious
wood
which
crowned
the
gentle
slope
at
the
foot
of
which
the
river
ran
another
considerable
body
of
water
which
had
been
carried
off
above
from
the
main
stream
to
flush
the
water
meadows
joined
its
parent
at
this
point
it
came
slowly
down
a
broad
artificial
ditch
running
parallel
with
the
main
stream
and
the
narrow
strip
of
land
which
divided
the
two
streams
ended
abruptly
just
below
the
lock
forming
a
splendid
point
for
bather
or
angler
tom
had
fixed
on
this
pool
as
his
as
a
child
keeps
its
plums
till
the
last
and
stole
over
the
bridge
stooping
low
to
gain
the
point
indicated
having
gained
it
he
glanced
round
to
be
aware
of
the
dwarf
and
willows
which
were
scattered
along
the
strip
and
might
catch
heedless
collars
and
spoil
sport
when
lying
lazily
almost
on
the
surface
where
the
backwater
met
the
stream
from
the
meadows
he
beheld
the
great
grandfather
of
all
trout
a
fellow
two
feet
long
and
a
foot
in
girth
at
the
shoulders
just
moving
fin
enough
to
keep
him
from
turning
over
on
to
his
back
he
threw
himself
flat
on
the
ground
and
crept
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
strip
the
king
fish
had
not
seen
him
and
the
next
moment
tom
saw
him
suck
in
a
bee
laden
with
his
morning
load
of
honey
who
touched
the
water
unwarily
close
to
his
nose
with
trembling
hand
tom
took
off
his
tail
fly
and
on
his
knee
substituted
a
governor
then
shortening
his
line
after
wetting
his
mimic
bee
in
the
pool
behind
him
tossed
it
gently
into
the
monster
very
jaws
for
a
moment
the
fish
seemed
scared
but
the
next
conscious
in
his
strength
lifted
his
nose
slowly
to
the
surface
and
sucked
in
the
bait
tom
struck
gently
and
then
sprang
to
his
feet
but
the
heavens
had
other
work
for
the
king
fish
who
dived
swiftly
under
the
bank
a
slight
jar
followed
and
tom
rod
was
straight
over
his
head
the
line
and
scarcely
a
yard
of
his
trusty
gut
collar
dangling
about
his
face
he
seized
this
remnant
with
horror
and
unsatisfied
longing
and
examined
it
with
care
could
he
have
overlooked
any
fraying
which
the
gut
might
have
got
in
the
morning
work
no
he
had
gone
over
every
inch
of
it
not
five
minutes
before
as
he
neared
the
pool
besides
it
was
cut
clean
through
not
a
trace
of
bruise
or
fray
about
it
how
could
it
have
happened
he
went
to
the
spot
and
looked
into
the
water
it
was
slightly
discolored
and
he
could
not
see
the
bottom
he
threw
his
fishing
coat
off
rolled
up
the
sleeve
of
his
flannel
shirt
and
lying
on
his
side
felt
about
the
bank
and
tried
to
reach
the
bottom
but
could
so
hearing
the
bell
ring
he
deferred
further
inquiry
and
stripped
in
silent
disgust
for
a
plunge
in
the
pool
three
times
he
hurled
himself
into
the
delicious
rush
of
the
cold
chalk
stream
with
that
utter
abandon
in
which
man
whose
bones
are
brittle
can
only
indulge
when
there
are
six
or
seven
feet
of
water
between
him
and
mother
earth
and
letting
the
stream
bear
him
away
at
its
own
sweet
will
to
the
shallows
below
struck
up
again
through
the
rush
and
the
roar
to
his
plunging
place
then
slowly
and
luxuriously
dressing
he
lit
his
short
pipe
companion
of
meditation
and
began
to
ruminate
on
the
escape
of
the
king
fish
what
could
have
cut
his
collar
the
more
he
thought
the
less
he
could
make
it
out
when
suddenly
he
was
aware
of
the
keeper
on
his
way
back
to
the
house
for
orders
and
breakfast
what
sport
sir
pretty
fair
said
tom
carelessly
lugging
five
plump
speckled
fellows
weighing
some
seven
and
a
half
pounds
out
of
his
creel
and
laying
them
out
for
the
keeper
inspection
well
they
be
in
prime
order
sir
surely
says
the
keeper
handling
them
they
allus
gets
mortal
thick
across
the
shoulders
while
the
be
on
loose
any
sir
i
put
in
some
little
ones
up
above
and
lost
one
screamer
just
up
the
black
ditch
there
he
must
have
been
a
and
went
off
and
be
hanged
to
him
with
two
yards
of
my
collar
and
a
couple
of
flies
how
on
earth
he
got
off
i
tell
and
he
went
on
to
unfold
the
particulars
of
the
short
struggle
the
keeper
could
hardly
keep
down
a
grin
ah
sir
said
he
i
thinks
i
knows
what
spwiled
your
sport
you
owes
it
all
to
that
chap
as
i
was
a
telling
you
of
or
my
name
not
willum
goddard
and
then
fishing
the
lockpole
with
a
hook
at
the
end
of
it
out
of
the
rushes
he
began
groping
under
the
bank
and
presently
hauled
up
a
sort
of
infernal
machine
consisting
of
a
heavy
lump
of
wood
a
yard
or
so
long
in
which
were
carefully
inserted
the
blades
of
four
or
five
old
knives
and
razors
while
a
crop
of
rusty
jagged
nails
filled
up
the
spare
space
tom
looked
at
it
in
wonder
what
devil
work
have
you
got
hold
of
there
he
said
at
last
bless
you
sir
said
the
keeper
is
only
our
shove
net
traps
as
i
was
a
telling
you
of
i
keeps
hard
upon
a
dozen
on
and
shifts
about
in
the
likeliest
holes
and
i
takes
care
to
let
the
men
as
is
about
the
water
meadows
see
me
on
up
a
bit
wi
a
file
now
and
again
and
since
master
gev
me
orders
to
put
in
i
do
think
they
tries
that
game
on
not
once
a
month
well
but
where
do
you
and
your
master
expect
to
go
to
if
you
set
such
things
as
those
about
said
tom
looking
serious
why
you
be
cutting
some
fellow
hand
or
foot
half
off
one
of
these
days
suppose
i
waded
up
the
bank
to
see
what
had
become
of
my
cast
lor
sir
i
never
thought
o
that
said
the
keeper
looking
sheepish
and
lifting
the
back
of
his
short
hat
off
his
head
to
make
room
for
a
scratch
but
added
he
turning
the
subject
if
you
wants
to
keep
they
artful
wosbirds
off
the
water
you
must
frighten
wi
summat
out
o
the
way
drattle
i
knows
they
puts
me
to
my
wit
end
but
you
never
had
five
such
fish
as
them
afore
breakfast
sir
if
we
did
stake
the
waters
well
and
i
do
want
if
i
ca
get
without
i
tell
you
what
it
is
keeper
this
razor
business
is
going
a
bit
too
far
men
ai
to
be
maimed
for
liking
a
bit
of
sport
you
set
in
the
woods
and
you
know
what
that
came
to
why
do
you
or
one
of
your
watchers
stop
out
here
at
night
and
catch
the
fellows
like
men
why
you
see
sir

do
allow
me
but
one

and
a
bad

too
well
she
told
him
once
when
he
would
gee
her
some
baccy
as
he
got
and

a
mind
to
as
he
fall
twice
into
the
water
for
once
as

out
and
th
poor

but
what

drownded
and
there
queer
sights
and
sounds
by
the
river
o

i
say
sir
let
alone
the
white
mist
as
makes
everything

but

afraid
of
ghosts
and

sir
but
then
there
the
pheasants
and

of

in
the
withey

and
a
sight
of
young

be
hard

to
to
mind

razors

the
keeper
from
behind

on
it
where
do

fellow

tom
after
a
minute
thought
mostly
at
reading
market
i
hears

said
tom
after
a
minute
silence
as
they
neared
the
house
the
wind
had
fallen
dead
and
not
a
spot
of
cloud
in
the
sky
not

but
we

is
that
good
greek
and
good
sense
i
do
see
it
they
only
laugh
and
sneer
if
we
go
back
now
they
laugh
at
us
twice
as
much
if
we
do
fancy
just
beginning
pool
now
on
that
stunning
table
come
along
brown
do
miss
your
chance
we
shall
be
sure
to
divide
the
pools
as
we
missed
the
claret
cool
hands
and
cool
heads
you
know
green
on
brown
pink
your
player
in
hand
that
a
good
deal
pleasanter
than
squatting
here
all
night
on
the
damp
grass
very
likely
but
you
wo
now
do
be
reasonable
will
you
come
if
i
stop
with
you
another
no
an
hour
then
say
till
ten
if
i
went
at
all
i
would
go
at
once
then
you
wo
come
no
i
bet
you
a
sovereign
you
never
see
a
poacher
and
then
how
sad
you
will
be
in
the
morning
it
will
be
much
worse
coming
in
to
breakfast
with
empty
hands
and
a
cold
in
the
head
than
going
in
now
they
will
chaff
then
i
grant
you
well
then
they
may
chaff
and
be
hanged
for
i
sha
go
in
now
tom
interlocutor
put
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
heather
mixture
shooting
coat
and
took
a
turn
or
two
of
some
dozen
yards
backwards
and
forwards
above
the
place
where
our
hero
was
sitting
he
did
like
going
in
and
facing
the
pool
players
by
himself
so
he
stopped
once
more
and
reopened
the
conversation
what
do
you
want
to
do
by
watching
all
night
brown
to
show
the
keeper
and
those
fellows
indoors
that
i
mean
what
i
say
i
said
i
do
it
and
i
will
you
do
want
to
catch
a
poacher
then
i
do
much
care
i
catch
one
if
he
comes
in
my
way
or
try
it
on
at
any
rate
i
say
brown
i
like
that
as
if
you
do
poach
yourself
why
i
remember
when
the
whiteham
keeper
spent
the
best
part
of
a
week
outside
the
college
gates
on
the
lookout
for
you
and
drysdale
and
some
other
fellows
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
why
you
ought
to
have
more
i
suppose
you
go
on
the
principle
of
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
tom
made
no
answer
and
his
companion
went
on
come
along
now
like
a
good
fellow
if
you
come
in
now
we
can
come
out
again
all
fresh
when
the
rest
go
to
bed
not
we
i
go
in
but
you
can
come
out
again
if
you
like
you
find
me
hereabouts
the
man
in
the
heather
mixture
had
now
shot
his
last
bolt
and
took
himself
off
to
the
house
leaving
tom
by
the
riverside
how
they
got
there
may
be
told
in
a
few
words
after
his
fishing
and
conversation
with
the
keeper
he
had
gone
in
full
of
his
subject
and
propounded
it
at
the
breakfast
table
his
strictures
on
the
knife
and
razor
business
produced
a
rather
warm
discussion
which
merged
in
the
question
whether
a
keeper
life
was
a
hard
one
till
something
was
said
implying
that
men
were
overworked
the
master
took
this
in
high
dudgeon
and
words
ran
high
in
the
discussion
tom
remarked
apropos
of
that
he
would
never
ask
another
man
to
do
what
he
would
not
do
himself
which
sentiment
was
endorsed
by
amongst
others
the
man
in
the
heather
mixture
the
host
had
retorted
that
they
had
better
in
that
case
try
it
themselves
which
remark
had
the
effect
of
making
tom
resolve
to
cut
short
his
visit
and
in
the
meantime
had
brought
him
and
his
ally
to
the
river
side
on
the
night
in
question
the
first
hour
as
we
have
seen
had
been
enough
for
the
ally
and
so
tom
was
left
in
company
with
a
plaid
a
stick
and
a
pipe
to
spend
the
night
by
himself
it
was
by
no
means
the
first
night
he
had
spent
in
the
open
air
and
promised
to
be
a
pleasant
one
for
camping
out
it
was
almost
the
longest
day
in
the
year
and
the
weather
was
magnificent
there
was
yet
an
hour
of
daylight
and
the
place
he
had
chosen
was
just
the
right
one
for
enjoying
the
evening
he
was
sitting
under
one
of
a
clump
of
huge
old
alders
growing
on
the
thin
strip
of
land
already
noticed
which
divided
the
main
stream
from
the
deep
artificial
ditch
which
fed
the
on
his
left
the
meadows
stretched
away
till
they
met
the
inclosed
on
his
right
ran
the
main
stream
some
fifty
feet
in
breadth
at
this
point
on
the
opposite
side
of
which
was
a
rough
piece
of
ground
half
half
copse
with
a
rank
growth
of
rushes
at
the
water
edge
these
were
the
chosen
haunts
of
the
and
whose
tracks
could
be
seen
by
dozens
like
small
open
doorways
looking
out
on
to
the
river
through
which
ran
a
number
of
mysterious
little
paths
into
the
beyond
the
sun
was
now
going
down
behind
the
copse
through
which
his
beams
came
aslant
chequered
and
mellow
the
stream
ran
dimpling
by
him
sleepily
swaying
the
masses
of
weed
under
the
surface
and
on
the
surface
and
the
trout
rose
under
the
banks
as
some
moth
or
gnat
or
gleaming
beetle
fell
into
the
stream
here
and
there
one
more
frolicsome
than
his
brethren
would
throw
himself
joyously
into
the
air
the
swifts
rushed
close
by
him
in
companies
of
five
or
six
and
wheeled
and
screamed
and
dashed
away
again
skimming
along
the
water
baffling
his
eye
as
he
tried
to
follow
their
flight
two
kingfishers
shot
suddenly
up
on
to
their
supper
station
on
a
stunted
willow
stump
some
twenty
yards
below
him
and
sat
there
in
the
glory
of
their
blue
backs
and
cloudy
red
waistcoats
watching
with
long
sagacious
beaks
pointed
to
the
water
beneath
and
every
now
and
then
dropping
like
flashes
of
light
into
the
stream
and
rising
again
with
what
seemed
one
motion
to
their
perches
a
heron
or
two
were
fishing
about
the
meadows
and
he
watched
them
stalking
about
in
their
sober
quaker
coats
or
rising
on
slow
heavy
wing
and
lumbering
away
home
with
a
weird
cry
he
heard
the
strong
pinions
of
the
wood
pigeon
in
the
air
and
then
from
the
trees
above
his
head
came
the
soft
call
with
which
that
fair
and
false
bird
is
said
to
have
beguilled
the
hapless
welchman
to
the
gallows
presently
as
he
lay
motionless
the
timid
and
graceful
little
peered
out
from
their
doors
in
the
rushes
opposite
and
seeing
no
cause
for
fear
stepped
daintily
into
the
water
and
were
suddenly
surrounded
by
little
bundles
of
black
soft
down
which
went
paddling
about
in
and
out
of
the
weeds
encouraged
by
the
occasional
sharp
clear
parental
and
merry
little
dabchicks
popped
up
in
and
looked
round
and
nodded
at
him
pert
and
voiceless
and
dived
again
even
old
cunning
sat
up
on
the
bank
with
round
black
noses
and
gleaming
eyes
or
took
solemn
swims
out
and
turned
up
their
tails
and
disappeared
for
his
amusement
a
comfortable
low
came
at
intervals
from
the
cattle
revelling
in
the
abundant
herbage
all
living
things
seemed
to
be
disporting
themselves
and
enjoying
after
their
kind
the
last
gleams
of
the
sunset
which
were
making
the
whole
vault
of
heaven
glow
and
shimmer
and
as
he
watched
them
tom
blessed
his
stars
as
he
contrasted
the
with
the
glare
of
lamps
and
the
click
of
balls
in
the
noisy
pool
room
before
it
got
dark
he
bethought
him
of
making
sure
of
his
position
once
more
matters
might
have
changed
since
he
chose
it
before
dinner
with
all
that
he
could
extract
from
the
keeper
and
his
own
experience
in
such
matters
it
had
taken
him
several
hours
hunting
up
and
down
the
river
that
afternoon
before
he
had
hit
on
a
but
he
had
persevered
knowing
that
this
was
the
only
safe
evidence
to
start
from
and
at
last
had
found
several
so
cunningly
set
that
it
was
clear
that
it
was
a
artist
in
the
poaching
line
against
whom
he
had
pitted
himself
these
lines
must
have
been
laid
almost
under
his
nose
on
that
very
day
as
the
freshness
of
the
baits
proved
the
one
which
he
had
selected
to
watch
by
was
under
the
bank
within
a
few
yards
of
the
clump
of
alders
where
he
was
now
sitting
there
was
no
satisfactory
cover
near
the
others
so
he
had
chosen
this
one
where
he
would
be
perfectly
concealed
behind
the
nearest
trunk
from
any
person
who
might
come
in
due
time
to
take
up
the
line
with
this
view
then
he
got
up
and
stepping
carefully
on
the
thickest
grass
where
his
foot
would
leave
no
mark
went
to
the
bank
and
felt
with
the
hook
of
his
stick
after
the
line
it
was
all
right
and
he
returned
to
his
old
seat
and
then
the
summer
twilight
came
on
and
the
birds
disappeared
and
the
hush
of
night
settled
down
on
river
and
copse
and
meadow
cool
and
gentle
summer
twilight
after
the
hot
bright
day
he
welcomed
it
too
as
it
folded
up
the
landscape
and
the
trees
lost
their
outline
and
settled
into
soft
black
masses
rising
here
and
there
out
of
the
white
mist
which
seemed
to
have
crept
up
to
within
a
few
yards
all
round
him
unawares
there
was
no
sound
now
but
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
water
and
an
occasional
rustle
of
reeds
or
of
the
leaves
over
his
head
as
a
stray
wandering
puff
of
air
passed
through
them
on
its
way
home
to
bed
nothing
to
listen
to
and
nothing
to
look
at
for
the
moon
had
not
risen
and
the
light
mist
hid
everything
except
a
star
or
two
right
up
above
him
so
the
outside
world
having
left
him
for
the
present
he
was
turned
inwards
on
himself
this
was
all
very
well
at
first
and
he
wrapped
the
plaid
round
his
shoulders
and
leant
against
his
tree
and
indulged
in
a
little
there
was
something
of
strangeness
and
adventure
in
his
solitary
which
had
its
charm
for
a
youngster
of
and
the
consciousness
of
not
running
from
his
word
of
doing
what
he
had
said
he
would
do
while
others
shirked
and
broke
down
was
decidedly
pleasant
but
this
satisfaction
did
not
last
very
long
and
the
night
began
to
get
a
little
wearisome
and
too
cool
to
be
quite
comfortable
by
degrees
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
his
task
crept
into
his
head
he
dismissed
them
for
a
time
by
turning
his
thoughts
to
other
matters
the
neighbourhood
of
englebourn
some
two
miles
up
above
him
reminded
him
of
the
previous
summer
and
he
wondered
how
he
should
get
on
with
his
cousin
when
they
met
he
should
probably
see
her
the
next
day
for
he
would
lose
no
time
in
calling
would
she
receive
him
well
would
she
have
much
to
tell
him
about
mary
he
had
been
more
hopeful
on
this
subject
of
late
but
the
loneliness
the
utter
solitude
and
silence
of
his
position
as
he
sat
there
in
the
misty
night
away
from
all
human
habitations
was
not
favorable
somehow
to
hopefulness
he
found
himself
getting
dreary
and
sombre
in
heart
more
and
more
so
as
the
minutes
rolled
on
and
the
silence
and
loneliness
pressed
on
him
more
and
more
heavily
he
was
surprised
at
his
own
and
tried
to
remember
how
he
had
spent
former
nights
so
pleasantly
out
of
doors
ah
he
had
always
had
a
companion
within
call
and
something
to
do
cray
fishing
bat
fowling
or
something
of
the
kind
sitting
there
doing
nothing
he
fancied
must
make
it
so
heavy
by
a
strong
effort
of
will
he
shook
off
the
oppression
he
moved
and
hummed
a
tune
to
break
the
silence
he
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
lest
it
should
again
master
him
if
wind
storm
pouring
rain
anything
to
make
sound
or
movement
would
but
come
but
neither
of
them
came
and
there
was
little
help
in
sound
or
movement
made
by
himself
besides
it
occurred
to
him
that
much
walking
up
and
down
might
defeat
the
object
of
his
watch
no
one
would
come
near
while
he
was
on
the
move
and
he
was
probably
making
marks
already
which
might
catch
the
eye
of
the
setter
of
the
nightlines
at
some
distance
if
that
cunning
party
waited
for
the
morning
light
and
might
keep
him
away
from
the
place
altogether
so
he
sat
down
again
on
his
old
seat
and
leant
hard
against
the
alder
trunk
as
though
to
steady
himself
and
keep
all
troublesome
thoughts
well
in
front
of
him
in
this
attitude
of
defense
he
reasoned
with
himself
on
the
absurdity
of
allowing
himself
to
be
depressed
by
the
mere
accidents
of
place
and
darkness
and
silence
but
all
the
reasoning
at
his
command
did
alter
the
fact
he
felt
the
enemy
advancing
again
and
casting
about
for
help
fell
back
on
the
thought
that
he
was
going
through
a
task
holding
to
his
word
doing
what
he
had
said
he
would
do
and
this
brought
him
some
relief
for
the
moment
he
fixed
his
mind
steadily
on
this
task
of
his
but
alas
here
again
in
his
very
last
stronghold
the
enemy
began
to
turn
his
flank
and
the
position
every
minute
became
more
and
more
untenable
he
had
of
late
fallen
into
a
pestilent
habit
of
himself
on
anything
which
he
was
about
setting
up
himself
like
a
cock
at
shrovetide
and
pelting
himself
with
inexorable
whys
and
wherefores
a
pestilent
habit
truly
he
had
found
it
and
one
which
left
a
man
no
peace
of
his
life
a
relentless
sleepless
habit
always
ready
to
take
advantage
of
him
but
never
so
viciously
alert
that
he
remembered
as
on
this
night
and
so
this
questioning
self
which
would
never
be
denied
for
long
began
to
examine
him
as
to
his
proposed
night
work
this
precious
task
which
he
was
so
proud
of
going
through
with
on
the
score
of
which
he
had
been
in
his
heart
crowing
over
others
because
they
had
not
taken
it
on
them
or
had
let
it
drop
what
then
was
the
meaning
of
it
what
was
he
out
there
for
what
had
he
come
out
to
do
they
were
awkward
questions
he
tried
several
answers
and
was
driven
from
one
to
another
till
he
was
bound
to
admit
that
he
was
out
there
that
night
partly
out
of
pique
and
partly
out
of
pride
and
that
his
object
next
to
earning
the
pleasure
of
thinking
himself
a
better
man
than
his
neighbours
was
if
so
be
to
catch
a
poacher
to
catch
a
poacher
what
business
had
he
to
be
catching
poachers
if
all
poachers
were
to
be
caught
he
would
have
to
be
caught
himself
he
had
just
had
an
unpleasant
reminder
of
this
fact
from
him
of
the
heather
mixture
a
parthian
remark
which
he
had
thrown
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
off
and
which
had
stuck
but
then
tom
argued
it
was
a
very
different
thing
his
poaching
going
out
for
a
day
lark
after
game
which
he
did
care
a
straw
for
but
only
for
the
sport
and
that
of
men
making
a
trade
of
it
like
the
man
the
keeper
spoke
of
why
how
different
if
there
were
any
difference
was
it
one
in
his
favour
avoiding
this
suggestion
he
took
up
new
ground
poachers
were
always
the
greatest
blackguards
in
their
neighbourhoods
pests
of
society
and
ought
to
be
put
down
possibly
at
any
rate
he
had
been
one
of
the
fraternity
in
his
time
and
was
scarcely
the
man
to
be
casting
stones
at
them
but
his
poaching
had
always
been
done
thoughtlessly
how
did
he
know
that
others
had
worse
motives
and
so
he
went
on
tossing
the
matter
backwards
and
forwards
in
his
mind
and
getting
more
and
more
uncomfortable
and
unable
to
answer
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
simple
question
what
right
have
you
to
be
out
here
on
this
errand
he
got
up
a
second
time
and
walked
up
and
down
but
with
no
better
success
than
before
the
change
of
position
and
exercise
did
not
help
him
out
of
his
difficulties
and
now
he
got
a
step
further
if
he
had
no
right
to
be
there
had
he
better
go
up
to
the
house
and
say
so
and
go
to
bed
like
the
rest
no
his
pride
could
stand
that
but
if
he
could
go
in
he
might
turn
in
to
a
barn
or
outhouse
nobody
would
be
any
the
wiser
then
and
after
all
he
was
not
pledged
to
stop
on
one
spot
all
night
it
was
a
tempting
suggestion
and
he
was
very
near
yielding
to
it
at
once
while
he
wavered
a
new
set
of
thoughts
came
up
to
back
it
how
if
he
stayed
there
and
a
gang
of
came
he
knew
that
many
of
them
were
desperate
men
he
had
no
arms
what
could
he
do
against
them
nothing
but
he
might
be
maimed
for
life
in
a
night
row
which
he
had
no
business
to
be
in
murdered
perhaps
he
stood
still
and
listened
long
and
painfully
every
moment
as
he
listened
the
silence
mastered
him
more
and
more
and
his
reason
became
more
and
more
powerless
it
was
such
a
silence
a
great
illimitable
vague
silence
the
silence
of
a
deserted
house
where
he
could
at
least
have
felt
that
he
was
bounded
somewhere
by
wall
and
floor
and
roof
where
men
must
have
lived
and
worked
once
though
they
might
be
there
no
longer
would
have
been
nothing
but
this
silence
of
the
huge
wide
world
where
there
was
nothing
but
air
and
space
around
and
above
him
and
the
ground
beneath
it
was
getting
irksome
intolerable
awful
the
great
silence
seemed
to
be
saying
to
him
you
are
alone
alone
alone
and
he
had
never
known
before
what
horror
lurked
in
that
thought
every
moment
that
he
stood
still
the
spell
grew
stronger
on
him
and
yet
he
dared
not
move
and
a
strange
wild
feeling
of
fear
unmistakable
physical
fear
which
made
his
heart
beat
and
his
limbs
tremble
seized
on
him
he
was
ready
to
cry
out
to
fall
down
to
run
and
yet
there
he
stood
listening
still
and
motionless
the
critical
moment
in
all
panics
must
come
at
last
a
wild
and
grewsome
hissing
and
snoring
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
air
just
over
his
head
made
him
start
and
spring
forward
and
gave
him
the
use
of
his
limbs
again
at
any
rate
though
they
would
not
have
been
worth
much
to
him
had
the
ghost
or
hobgoblin
appeared
whom
he
half
expected
to
see
the
next
moment
then
came
a
screech
which
seemed
to
flit
along
the
rough
meadow
opposite
and
come
towards
him
he
drew
a
long
breath
for
he
knew
that
sound
well
enough
it
was
nothing
after
all
but
the
owls
the
mere
realized
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
some
living
creatures
were
they
only
owls
brought
him
to
his
senses
and
now
the
moon
was
well
up
and
the
wayward
mist
had
cleared
away
and
he
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
solemn
birds
every
now
and
then
beating
over
the
rough
meadow
backwards
and
forwards
and
over
the
shallow
water
as
regularly
as
trained
pointers
he
threw
himself
down
again
under
his
tree
and
now
bethought
himself
of
his
pipe
here
was
a
companion
which
wonderful
to
say
he
had
not
thought
of
before
since
the
night
set
in
he
pulled
it
out
but
paused
before
lighting
nothing
was
so
likely
to
betray
his
whereabouts
as
tobacco
true
but
anything
was
better
than
such
another
fright
as
he
had
had
so
here
goes
he
thought
if
i
keep
off
all
the
poachers
in
berkshire
and
he
accordingly
lighted
up
and
with
the
help
of
his
pipe
once
more
debated
with
himself
the
question
of
beating
a
retreat
after
a
sharp
inward
struggle
he
concluded
to
stay
and
see
it
out
he
should
despise
himself
more
than
he
cared
to
face
if
he
gave
in
now
if
he
left
that
spot
before
morning
the
motive
would
be
sheer
cowardice
there
might
be
fifty
other
good
reasons
for
going
but
if
he
went
reason
would
be
fear
and
nothing
else
it
might
have
been
wrong
and
foolish
to
come
out
it
must
be
to
go
in
now
fear
never
made
a
man
do
a
right
action
he
summed
up
to
himself
so
here
i
stop
come
what
may
of
it
i
think
i
seen
the
worst
of
it
now
i
was
in
a
real
blue
funk
and
no
mistake
let
see
was
i
laughing
this
morning
at
the
watcher
who
did
like
passing
a
night
by
the
river
well
he
has
got
the
laugh
on
me
now
if
he
only
knew
it
i
learnt
one
lesson
at
any
rate
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
very
hard
on
cowards
again
by
the
time
he
had
finished
his
pipe
he
was
a
man
again
and
moreover
notwithstanding
the
damp
began
to
feel
sleepy
now
that
his
mind
was
thoroughly
made
up
and
his
nerves
were
quiet
so
he
made
the
best
of
his
plaid
and
picked
a
softish
place
and
went
off
into
a
sort
of
which
lasted
at
intervals
through
the
short
summer
night
a
poor
thin
sort
of
sleep
it
was
in
which
he
never
altogether
lost
his
consciousness
and
broken
by
short
intervals
of
actual
wakefulness
but
a
blessed
release
from
the
and
panics
of
the
early
night
he
woke
at
last
with
a
shiver
it
was
colder
than
he
had
yet
felt
it
and
it
seemed
lighter
he
stretched
his
limbs
and
sat
up
yes
it
was
certainly
getting
light
for
he
could
just
make
out
the
figures
on
the
face
of
his
watch
which
he
pulled
out
the
dawn
was
almost
upon
him
and
his
night
watch
was
over
nothing
had
come
of
it
as
yet
except
his
fright
at
which
he
could
now
laugh
comfortably
enough
probably
nothing
more
might
come
of
it
after
all
but
he
had
done
the
task
he
had
set
himself
without
flinching
and
that
was
a
satisfaction
he
wound
up
his
watch
which
he
had
forgotten
to
do
the
night
before
and
then
stood
up
and
threw
his
damp
plaid
aside
and
swung
his
arm
across
his
chest
to
restore
circulation
the
crescent
moon
was
high
up
in
the
sky
faint
and
white
and
he
could
scarcely
now
make
out
the
stars
which
were
fading
out
as
the
glow
in
the
got
stronger
and
broader
forgetting
for
a
moment
the
purpose
of
his
vigil
he
was
thinking
of
a
long
morning
fishing
and
had
turned
to
pick
up
his
plaid
and
go
off
to
the
house
for
his
when
he
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
dry
wood
snapping
he
listened
intently
and
the
next
moment
it
came
again
some
way
off
but
plainly
to
be
heard
in
the
intense
stillness
of
the
morning
some
living
thing
was
moving
down
the
stream
another
moment
listening
and
he
was
convinced
that
the
sound
came
from
a
hedge
some
hundred
yards
below
he
had
noticed
the
hedge
before
the
keeper
had
stopped
up
a
gap
in
it
the
day
before
at
the
place
where
it
came
down
to
the
water
with
some
old
hurdles
and
dry
thorns
he
drew
himself
up
behind
his
alder
looking
out
from
behind
it
cautiously
towards
the
point
from
which
the
sound
came
he
could
just
make
out
the
hedge
through
the
mist
but
saw
nothing
but
now
the
crackling
began
again
and
he
was
sure
that
a
man
was
forcing
his
way
over
the
keeper
barricade
a
moment
afterwards
he
saw
a
figure
drop
from
the
hedge
into
the
slip
in
which
he
stood
he
drew
back
his
head
hastily
and
his
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
as
he
waited
the
approach
of
the
stranger
in
a
few
seconds
the
suspense
was
too
much
for
him
for
again
there
was
perfect
silence
he
peered
out
a
second
time
cautiously
round
the
tree
and
now
he
could
make
out
the
figure
of
a
man
stopping
by
the
just
above
the
hedge
and
drawing
in
a
line
this
was
enough
and
he
drew
back
again
and
made
himself
small
behind
the
tree
now
he
was
sure
that
the
keeper
enemy
the
man
he
had
come
out
to
take
was
here
his
next
halt
would
be
at
the
line
which
was
set
within
a
few
yards
of
the
place
where
he
stood
so
the
struggle
which
he
had
courted
was
come
all
his
doubts
of
the
night
wrestled
in
his
mind
for
a
minute
but
forcing
them
down
he
strung
himself
up
for
the
encounter
his
whole
frame
trembling
with
excitement
and
his
blood
tingling
through
his
veins
as
though
it
would
burst
them
the
next
minute
was
as
severe
a
trial
of
nerve
as
he
had
ever
been
put
to
and
the
sound
of
a
stealthy
tread
on
the
grass
just
below
came
to
him
as
a
relief
it
stopped
and
he
heard
the
man
stoop
then
came
a
stir
in
the
water
and
the
flapping
as
of
a
fish
being
landed
now
was
his
time
he
sprang
from
behind
the
tree
and
the
next
moment
was
over
the
stooping
figure
of
the
poacher
before
he
could
seize
him
the
man
sprung
up
and
grappled
with
him
they
had
come
to
a
tight
lock
at
once
for
the
poacher
had
risen
so
close
under
him
that
he
could
not
catch
his
collar
and
hold
him
off
too
close
to
strike
it
was
a
desperate
trial
of
strength
and
bottom
tom
knew
in
a
moment
that
he
had
his
work
cut
out
for
him
he
felt
the
nervous
power
of
the
frame
he
had
got
hold
of
as
he
drove
his
chin
into
the
poacher
shoulder
and
arched
his
back
and
strained
every
muscle
in
his
body
to
force
him
backwards
but
in
vain
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
hold
his
own
but
he
felt
that
he
might
hold
it
yet
as
they
staggered
on
the
brink
of
the
back
ditch
stamping
the
grass
and
marsh
marigolds
into
the
ground
and
drawing
deep
breath
through
their
set
teeth
a
slip
a
false
a
failing
muscle
and
it
would
be
over
down
they
must
would
be
uppermost
the
poacher
had
trod
on
a
soft
place
and
tom
felt
it
and
throwing
himself
forward
was
reckoning
on
victory
but
reckoning
without
his
host
for
recovering
himself
with
a
twist
of
the
body
which
brought
them
still
closer
together
the
poacher
locked
his
leg
behind
tom
in
a
crook
which
brought
the
wrestlings
of
his
boyhood
into
his
head
with
a
flash
as
they
tottered
for
another
moment
and
then
losing
balance
went
headlong
over
with
a
heavy
plunge
and
splash
into
the
deep
back
ditch
locked
in
each
other
arms
the
cold
water
closed
over
them
and
for
a
moment
tom
held
as
tight
as
ever
under
or
above
the
surface
it
was
all
the
same
he
could
give
in
first
but
a
gulp
of
water
and
the
singing
in
his
ears
and
a
feeling
of
choking
brought
him
to
his
senses
helped
too
by
the
thought
of
his
mother
and
mary
and
love
of
the
pleasant
world
up
above
the
folly
and
uselessness
of
being
drowned
in
a
ditch
on
a
point
of
honor
stood
out
before
him
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
else
all
his
life
and
he
let
go
his
hold
much
relieved
to
find
that
his
companion
of
the
bath
seemed
equally
willing
to
be
quit
of
him
and
struggled
to
the
surface
and
seized
the
bank
gasping
and
exhausted
his
first
thought
was
to
turn
round
and
look
for
his
adversary
the
poacher
was
by
the
bank
too
a
few
feet
from
him
his
cap
had
fallen
off
in
the
struggle
and
all
chance
of
concealment
being
over
he
too
had
turned
to
face
the
matter
out
and
their
eyes
met
good
god
harry
is
it
you
harry
winburn
answered
nothing
and
the
two
dragged
their
feet
out
of
the
muddy
bottom
and
scrambled
on
to
the
bank
and
then
with
a
sort
of
common
instinct
sat
down
dripping
and
foolish
each
on
the
place
he
had
reached
and
looked
at
one
another
probably
two
more
thoroughly
bewildered
lieges
of
her
majesty
were
not
at
that
moment
facing
one
another
in
any
corner
of
the
united
kingdom
chapter
xxxviii
mary
in
mayfair
on
the
night
which
our
hero
spent
by
the
side
of
the
river
with
the
results
detailed
in
the
last
chapter
there
was
a
great
ball
in
mayfair
it
was
the
height
of
the
season
and
of
course
balls
concerts
and
parties
of
all
kinds
were
going
on
in
all
parts
of
the
great
babylon
but
the
entertainment
in
question
was
event
of
that
evening
persons
behind
the
scenes
would
have
told
you
at
once
had
you
happened
to
meet
them
and
enquire
on
the
subject
during
the
previous
ten
days
that
was
the
place
in
which
everybody
who
went
anywhere
ought
to
spend
some
hours
between
eleven
and
three
on
this
particular
evening
if
you
did
not
happen
to
be
going
there
you
had
better
stay
quietly
at
your
club
or
your
home
and
not
speak
of
your
engagements
for
that
night
a
great
awning
had
sprung
up
in
the
course
of
the
day
over
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
door
and
as
the
evening
closed
in
tired
lawyers
and
merchants
on
their
return
from
the
city
and
the
riders
and
drivers
on
their
way
home
from
the
park
might
have
seen
holland
men
laying
red
drugget
over
the
pavement
and
gunter
carts
coming
and
going
and
the
police
moving
on
the
street
boys
and
servant
maids
and
other
curious
members
of
the
masses
who
paused
to
stare
at
the
preparations
then
came
the
lighting
up
of
the
rooms
and
the
blaze
of
pure
white
light
from
the
uncurtained
ballroom
windows
spread
into
the
street
and
the
musicians
passed
in
with
their
instruments
then
after
a
short
pause
the
carriages
of
a
few
intimate
friends
who
came
early
at
the
hostess
express
desire
began
to
drive
up
and
the
hansom
cabs
of
the
contemporaries
of
the
eldest
son
from
which
issued
guardsmen
and
men
and
other
of
the
most
approved
description
then
the
crowd
collected
again
round
the
door
a
sadder
crowd
now
to
the
eye
of
anyone
who
has
time
to
look
at
it
with
sallow
haggard
looking
men
here
and
there
on
the
skirts
of
it
and
tawdry
women
joking
and
pushing
to
the
front
through
the
powdered
footmen
and
linkmen
in
red
waistcoats
already
clamorous
and
redolent
of
gin
and
beer
and
scarcely
kept
back
by
the
constables
of
the
a
division
told
off
for
the
special
duty
of
attending
and
keeping
order
on
so
important
an
occasion
then
comes
a
rush
of
carriages
and
by
eleven
the
line
stretches
away
half
round
grosvenor
square
and
moves
at
a
towards
the
lights
and
the
music
and
the
shouting
street
in
the
middle
of
the
line
is
the
comfortable
chariot
of
our
friend
porter
the
corners
occupied
by
himself
and
his
wife
while
miss
mary
sits
well
forward
between
them
her
white
muslin
dress
looped
up
with
sprigs
of
heather
spread
delicately
on
either
side
over
their
knees
and
herself
in
a
pleasant
tremor
of
impatience
and
excitement
how
very
slow
robert
is
mamma
we
shall
never
get
to
the
house
he
can
not
get
on
faster
my
dear
the
carriage
in
front
of
us
must
set
down
you
know
but
i
wish
they
would
be
quicker
i
wonder
whether
we
shall
know
many
people
do
you
think
i
shall
get
partners
not
waiting
for
her
mother
reply
she
went
on
to
name
some
of
her
acquaintance
who
she
knew
would
be
there
and
bewailing
the
hard
fate
which
was
keeping
her
out
of
the
first
dances
excitement
and
impatience
were
natural
enough
the
ball
was
not
like
most
balls
it
was
a
great
battle
in
the
midst
of
the
skirmishes
of
the
season
and
she
felt
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
and
porter
had
for
years
past
dropped
into
a
quiet
sort
of
life
in
which
they
saw
few
but
their
own
friends
and
contemporaries
they
generally
left
london
before
the
season
was
at
its
height
and
had
altogether
fallen
out
of
the
and
party
going
world
mary
coming
out
had
changed
their
way
of
life
for
her
sake
they
had
spent
the
winter
at
rome
and
now
that
they
were
at
home
again
they
were
picking
up
the
threads
of
old
acquaintance
and
encountering
the
disagreeables
of
a
return
into
habits
long
disused
and
almost
forgotten
the
giver
of
the
ball
was
a
stirring
man
in
political
life
rich
clever
and
much
sought
after
he
was
an
old
of
porter
and
their
intimacy
had
never
been
wholly
laid
aside
notwithstanding
the
severance
of
their
paths
in
life
now
that
mary
must
be
taken
out
the
house
was
one
of
the
first
to
which
the
porters
turned
and
the
invitation
to
this
ball
was
one
of
the
first
consequences
if
the
truth
must
be
told
neither
her
father
nor
mother
were
in
sympathy
with
mary
as
they
gradually
neared
the
place
of
setting
down
and
would
far
rather
have
been
going
to
a
much
less
imposing
place
where
they
could
have
driven
up
at
once
to
the
door
and
would
not
have
been
made
uncomfortable
by
the
shoutings
of
their
names
from
servant
to
servant
however
after
the
first
plunge
when
they
had
made
their
bows
to
their
kind
and
smiling
hostess
and
had
passed
on
into
the
already
well
filled
rooms
their
shyness
began
to
wear
off
and
they
could
in
some
sort
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
sight
from
a
quiet
corner
they
were
not
long
troubled
with
miss
mary
she
had
not
been
in
the
two
minutes
before
the
eldest
son
of
the
house
had
found
her
out
and
engaged
her
for
the
next
waltz
they
had
met
several
times
already
and
were
on
the
best
terms
and
the
freshness
and
brightness
of
her
look
and
manner
and
the
evident
enjoyment
of
her
partner
as
they
laughed
and
talked
together
in
the
intervals
of
the
dance
soon
attracted
the
attention
of
the
young
men
who
began
to
ask
one
another
who
is
norman
dancing
with
and
to
ejaculate
with
various
strength
according
to
their
several
temperaments
as
to
her
face
and
figure
and
dress
as
they
were
returning
towards
porter
norman
was
pulled
by
the
sleeve
more
than
once
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
introduce
first
one
and
then
another
of
his
friends
mary
gave
herself
up
to
the
fascination
of
the
scene
she
had
never
been
in
rooms
so
perfectly
lighted
with
such
a
floor
such
exquisite
music
and
so
many
pretty
and
looking
people
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
enjoy
it
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
and
danced
and
laughed
and
talked
herself
into
the
good
graces
of
partner
after
partner
till
she
began
to
attract
the
notice
of
some
of
the
people
who
are
to
be
found
in
every
room
and
who
can
not
pardon
the
pure
and
buoyant
and
unsuspecting
mirth
which
carries
away
all
but
themselves
in
its
bright
stream
so
mary
passed
on
from
one
partner
to
another
with
whom
we
have
no
concern
until
at
last
a
young
lieutenant
in
the
guards
who
had
just
finished
his
second
dance
with
her
led
up
a
friend
whom
he
begged
to
introduce
miss
porter
st
cloud
and
then
after
the
usual
preliminaries
mary
left
her
mother
side
again
and
stood
up
by
the
side
of
her
new
partner
it
is
your
first
season
i
believe
miss
porter
yes
my
first
in
london
i
thought
so
and
you
have
only
just
come
to
town
we
came
back
from
rome
six
weeks
ago
and
have
been
in
town
ever
since
but
i
am
sure
i
have
not
seen
you
anywhere
this
season
until
you
have
not
been
out
much
yet
yes
indeed
papa
and
mamma
are
very
and
go
whenever
we
are
asked
to
a
ball
as
i
am
fond
of
dancing
how
very
odd
and
yet
i
am
quite
sure
i
should
have
remembered
it
if
we
had
met
before
in
town
this
year
is
it
so
very
odd
asked
mary
laughing
london
is
a
very
large
place
it
seems
very
natural
that
two
people
should
be
able
to
live
in
it
for
a
long
time
without
meeting
indeed
you
are
quite
mistaken
you
will
find
out
very
soon
how
small
london
is
at
least
how
small
society
is
and
you
will
get
to
know
every
face
quite
well
i
mean
the
face
of
everyone
in
society
you
must
have
a
wonderful
memory
yes
i
have
a
good
memory
for
faces
and
by
the
way
i
am
sure
i
have
seen
you
before
but
not
in
town
and
i
can
not
remember
where
but
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
have
a
memory
to
know
everybody
in
society
by
sight
you
meet
every
night
almost
and
altogether
there
are
only
two
or
three
hundred
faces
to
remember
and
then
there
is
something
in
the
look
of
people
and
the
way
they
come
into
a
room
or
stand
about
which
tells
you
at
once
whether
they
are
amongst
those
whom
you
need
trouble
yourself
about
well
i
can
not
understand
it
i
seem
to
be
in
a
whirl
of
faces
and
can
hardly
ever
remember
any
of
them
you
will
soon
get
used
to
it
by
the
end
of
the
season
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
and
you
ought
to
make
a
study
of
it
or
you
will
never
feel
at
home
in
london
i
must
make
good
use
of
my
time
then
i
suppose
i
ought
to
know
everybody
here
for
instance
almost
everybody
and
i
really
do
not
know
the
names
of
a
dozen
people
will
you
let
me
give
you
a
lesson
oh
yes
i
shall
be
much
obliged
then
let
us
stand
here
and
we
will
take
them
as
they
pass
to
the
so
they
stood
near
the
of
the
and
he
ran
on
exchanging
constant
nods
and
remarks
with
the
passers
by
as
the
stream
flowed
to
and
from
the
ices
and
cup
and
then
rattling
on
to
his
partner
with
the
names
and
short
sketches
of
the
characters
and
peculiarities
of
his
large
acquaintance
mary
was
very
much
amused
and
had
no
time
to
notice
the
of
most
of
his
remarks
and
he
had
the
wit
to
keep
within
what
he
considered
the
most
innocent
bounds
there
you
know
him
of
course
he
said
as
an
elderly
looking
man
with
a
star
passed
them
yes
at
least
i
mean
i
know
him
by
sight
i
saw
him
at
the
commemoration
at
oxford
last
year
they
gave
him
an
honorary
degree
on
his
return
from
india
at
oxford
were
you
present
at
the
grand
commemoration
then
yes
the
commemoration
ball
was
the
first
public
ball
i
was
ever
at
ah
that
explains
it
all
i
must
have
seen
you
there
i
told
you
we
had
met
before
i
was
perfectly
sure
of
it
what
were
you
there
then
yes
i
had
the
honor
of
being
present
at
your
first
ball
you
see
but
how
curious
that
you
should
remember
me
do
you
really
think
so
surely
there
are
some
faces
which
once
seen
one
can
never
forget
i
am
so
glad
that
you
know
dear
oxford
i
know
it
too
well
perhaps
to
share
your
enthusiasm
how
do
you
mean
i
spent
nearly
three
years
there
what
were
you
at
oxford
last
year
yes
i
left
before
commemoration
but
i
went
up
for
the
gaieties
and
i
am
glad
of
it
as
i
shall
have
one
pleasant
memory
of
the
place
now
oh
i
wonder
you
do
love
it
but
what
college
were
you
of
why
you
talk
like
a
graduate
i
was
of
st
ambrose
ambrose
that
is
my
college
indeed
i
wish
we
had
been
in
residence
at
the
same
time
i
mean
that
we
almost
lived
there
at
the
commemoration
have
you
any
relation
there
then
no
not
a
relation
only
a
distant
connexion
may
i
ask
his
name
brown
did
you
know
him
yes
we
were
not
in
the
same
set
he
was
a
boating
man
i
think
she
felt
that
he
was
watching
her
narrowly
now
and
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
herself
reasonably
composed
as
it
was
she
could
not
help
showing
a
little
that
she
felt
embarrassed
and
looked
down
and
changed
colour
slightly
busying
herself
with
her
bouquet
she
longed
to
continue
the
conversation
but
somehow
the
manner
of
her
partner
kept
her
from
doing
so
she
resolved
to
recur
to
the
subject
carelessly
if
they
met
again
when
she
knew
him
better
the
fact
of
his
having
been
at
ambrose
made
her
wish
to
know
him
better
and
gave
him
a
good
start
in
her
favor
but
for
the
moment
she
felt
that
she
must
change
the
subject
so
looking
up
she
fixed
on
the
first
people
who
happened
to
be
passing
and
asked
who
they
were
oh
nobody
constituents
probably
or
something
of
that
sort
i
do
understand
why
you
see
we
are
in
a
political
house
so
you
may
set
down
the
people
whom
nobody
knows
as
troublesome
or
that
kind
of
thing
who
would
he
disagreeable
at
the
next
election
if
they
were
not
asked
then
you
do
not
include
them
in
society
by
no
manner
of
means
and
i
need
not
take
the
trouble
to
remember
their
faces
of
course
not
there
is
a
sediment
of
rubbish
at
almost
every
house
at
the
parties
here
it
is
political
rubbish
night
at
lady
aubrey
you
will
be
there
i
hope
no
we
do
not
know
her
i
am
sorry
for
that
well
there
we
shall
have
the
scientific
rubbish
and
at
other
houses
you
see
queer
artists
and
writing
people
in
fact
it
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
to
get
a
party
where
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
and
after
all
it
is
rather
amusing
to
watch
the
habits
of
the
different
species
well
to
me
the
rubbish
as
you
call
it
seems
much
like
the
rest
i
am
sure
these
people
were
ladies
and
gentlemen
very
likely
he
said
lifting
his
eyebrows
but
you
may
see
at
a
glance
that
they
have
not
the
air
of
society
here
again
look
yourself
you
can
see
that
these
are
constituents
to
the
horror
of
st
cloud
the
advancing
constituents
made
straight
for
his
partner
mary
my
dear
exclaimed
the
lady
where
have
you
been
we
have
lost
you
ever
since
the
last
dance
i
have
been
standing
here
mamma
she
said
and
then
slipping
from
her
late
partner
arm
she
made
a
demure
little
bow
and
passed
into
the
with
her
father
and
mother
st
cloud
bit
his
lip
and
swore
at
himself
under
his
breath
as
he
looked
after
them
what
an
infernal
idiot
i
must
have
been
not
to
know
that
her
people
would
be
sure
to
turn
out
something
of
that
sort
thought
he
by
jove
i
go
after
them
and
set
myself
right
before
the
little
minx
has
time
to
think
it
over
he
took
a
step
or
two
towards
the
but
then
thought
better
of
it
or
his
courage
failed
him
at
any
rate
he
turned
round
again
and
sought
the
where
he
joined
a
knot
of
young
gentlemen
indulging
in
delicate
little
raised
pies
and
salads
and
liberal
potations
at
iced
claret
or
champagne
cup
amongst
them
was
the
guardsman
who
had
introduced
him
to
mary
and
who
received
him
as
he
came
up
with
well
st
cloud
i
hope
you
are
alive
to
your
obligations
to
me
for
shunting
your
late
partner
on
to
me
yes
quite
you
be
hanged
replied
the
guardsman
you
may
pretend
what
you
please
now
but
you
would
let
me
alone
till
i
had
introduced
you
are
you
talking
about
the
girl
in
white
muslin
with
fern
leaves
in
her
hair
asked
another
yes
what
do
you
think
of
her
devilish
taking
i
think
i
say
ca
you
introduce
me
they
say
she
has
tin
i
ca
say
i
think
much
of
her
looks
said
st
cloud
acting
up
to
his
principle
of
telling
a
lie
sooner
than
let
his
real
thoughts
be
seen
do
you
said
the
guardsman
well
i
like
her
form
better
than
anything
out
this
year
such
a
clean
stepper
you
should
just
dance
with
her
and
so
they
went
on
criticizing
mary
and
others
of
their
partners
exactly
as
they
would
have
talked
of
a
stud
of
racers
till
they
found
themselves
sufficiently
refreshed
to
encounter
new
labors
and
broke
up
returning
in
twos
and
threes
towards
the
st
cloud
attached
himself
to
the
guardsman
and
returned
to
the
charge
you
seem
hit
by
that
girl
he
began
have
you
known
her
long
about
a
week
i
met
her
once
before
do
you
know
her
people
who
is
her
father
a
old
party
you
would
think
it
to
look
at
her
but
i
hear
he
is
very
solvent
any
sons
do
know
i
like
your
talking
of
my
being
hit
st
cloud
there
she
is
i
shall
go
and
try
for
another
waltz
the
guardsman
was
successful
and
carried
off
mary
from
her
father
and
mother
who
were
standing
together
watching
the
dancing
st
cloud
after
looking
them
well
over
sought
out
the
hostess
and
begged
to
be
introduced
to
and
porter
gleaning
at
the
same
time
some
particulars
of
who
they
were
the
introduction
was
effected
in
a
minute
the
lady
of
the
house
being
glad
to
get
anyone
to
talk
to
the
porters
who
were
almost
strangers
amongst
her
other
guests
she
managed
before
leaving
them
to
whisper
to
porter
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
excellent
connexions
st
cloud
made
the
most
of
his
time
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
to
please
and
being
fluent
of
speech
and
thoroughly
satisfied
with
himself
had
no
shyness
or
awkwardness
to
get
over
and
jumped
at
once
into
the
good
graces
of
mary
parents
when
she
returned
after
the
waltz
she
found
him
to
her
no
small
astonishment
deep
in
conversation
with
her
mother
who
was
listening
with
a
pleased
expression
to
his
small
talk
he
pretended
not
to
see
her
at
first
and
then
begged
porter
to
introduce
him
formally
to
her
daughter
though
he
had
already
had
the
honour
of
dancing
with
her
mary
put
on
her
shortest
and
coldest
manner
and
thought
she
had
never
heard
of
such
impertinence
that
he
should
be
there
talking
so
familiarly
to
her
mother
after
the
slip
he
had
made
to
her
was
almost
too
much
even
for
her
temper
but
she
went
off
for
another
dance
and
again
returned
and
found
him
still
there
this
time
entertaining
porter
with
political
gossip
the
unfavourable
impression
began
to
wear
off
and
she
soon
resolved
not
to
make
up
her
mind
about
him
without
some
further
knowledge
in
due
course
he
asked
her
to
dance
again
and
they
stood
in
a
quadrille
she
stood
by
him
looking
straight
before
her
and
perfectly
silent
wondering
how
he
would
open
the
conversation
he
did
not
leave
her
long
in
suspense
what
charming
people
your
father
and
mother
are
miss
porter
he
said
i
am
so
glad
to
have
been
introduced
to
them
indeed
you
are
very
kind
we
ought
to
be
flattered
by
your
study
of
us
and
i
am
sure
i
hope
you
will
find
it
amusing
st
cloud
was
a
little
embarrassed
by
the
rejoinder
and
was
not
sorry
at
the
moment
to
find
himself
called
upon
to
perform
the
second
figure
by
the
time
he
was
at
her
side
again
he
had
recovered
himself
you
ca
understand
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
meet
some
one
with
a
little
freshness
he
paused
to
think
how
he
should
end
his
sentence
who
has
not
the
air
of
society
she
suggested
yes
i
quite
understand
indeed
you
quite
mistake
me
surely
you
have
not
taken
seriously
the
nonsense
i
was
talking
just
now
i
am
a
constituent
you
know
i
do
understand
how
to
take
the
talk
of
society
oh
i
see
then
that
you
are
angry
at
my
joke
and
will
not
believe
that
i
knew
your
father
perfectly
by
sight
you
really
can
not
seriously
fancy
that
i
was
alluding
to
anyone
connected
with
you
and
then
he
proceeded
to
retail
the
particulars
he
had
picked
up
from
the
lady
of
the
house
as
if
they
had
been
familiar
to
him
for
years
and
to
launch
out
again
into
praises
of
her
father
and
mother
mary
looked
straight
up
in
his
face
and
though
he
did
not
meet
her
eye
his
manner
was
so
composed
that
she
began
to
doubt
her
own
senses
and
then
he
suddenly
changed
the
subject
to
oxford
and
the
commemoration
and
by
the
end
of
the
set
could
flatter
himself
that
he
had
quite
dispelled
the
cloud
which
had
looked
so
threatening
mary
had
a
great
success
that
evening
she
took
part
in
every
dance
and
might
have
had
two
or
three
partners
at
once
if
they
would
have
been
of
any
use
to
her
when
at
last
porter
insisted
that
he
would
keep
his
horses
no
longer
st
cloud
and
the
guardsman
accompanied
her
to
the
door
and
were
assiduous
in
the
cloak
room
young
men
are
pretty
much
like
a
drove
of
sheep
anyone
who
takes
a
decided
line
in
certain
matters
is
sure
to
lead
all
the
rest
the
guardsman
left
the
ball
in
the
firm
belief
as
he
himself
expressed
it
that
mary
had
done
his
business
for
life
and
being
quite
above
concealment
persisted
in
singing
her
praises
over
his
cigar
at
the
club
to
which
many
of
the
dancers
adjourned
and
from
that
night
she
became
the
fashion
with
the
set
in
which
st
cloud
lived
the
more
enterprising
of
them
he
amongst
the
foremost
were
soon
intimate
in
porter
house
and
spoke
well
of
his
dinners
porter
changed
his
hour
of
riding
in
the
park
at
their
suggestion
and
now
he
and
his
daughter
were
always
sure
of
companions
invitations
multiplied
for
mary
success
was
so
decided
that
she
floated
her
astonished
parents
into
a
whirl
of
balls
and
breakfasts
porter
and
his
wife
were
flattered
themselves
and
pleased
to
see
their
daughter
admired
and
enjoying
herself
and
in
the
next
six
weeks
mary
had
the
opportunity
of
getting
all
the
good
and
the
bad
which
a
girl
of
eighteen
can
extract
from
a
london
season
the
test
was
a
severe
one
two
months
of
constant
excitement
of
pure
and
simple
will
not
leave
people
just
as
they
found
them
and
mary
habits
and
thoughts
and
ways
of
looking
at
and
judging
of
people
and
things
were
much
changed
by
the
time
that
the
gay
world
melted
away
from
mayfair
and
belgravia
and
it
was
time
for
all
respectable
people
to
pull
down
the
blinds
and
shut
the
shutters
of
their
town
houses
chapter
xxxix
what
came
of
the
night
watch
the
last
knot
of
the
dancers
came
out
of
the
club
and
were
strolling
up
james
street
and
stopping
to
chaff
the
itinerant
coffee
vendor
who
was
preparing
his
stand
at
the
corner
of
piccadilly
for
his
early
customers
just
about
the
time
that
tom
was
beginning
to
rouse
himself
under
the
and
stretch
his
stiffened
limbs
and
sniff
the
morning
air
by
the
time
the
guardsman
had
let
himself
into
his
lodgings
in
mount
street
our
hero
had
undergone
his
unlooked
for
bath
and
was
sitting
in
a
state
of
utter
bewilderment
as
to
what
was
next
to
be
said
or
done
dripping
and
disconcerted
opposite
to
the
equally
dripping
and
to
all
appearance
equally
disconcerted
poacher
at
first
he
did
not
look
higher
than
his
antagonist
boots
and
gaiters
and
spent
a
few
seconds
by
the
way
in
considering
whether
the
arrangement
of
nails
on
the
bottom
of
harry
boots
was
better
than
his
own
he
settled
that
it
must
be
better
for
wading
on
slippery
stones
and
that
he
would
adopt
it
and
then
passed
on
to
wonder
whether
harry
boots
were
as
full
of
water
as
his
own
and
whether
corduroys
wet
through
must
not
be
very
uncomfortable
so
early
in
the
morning
and
congratulated
himself
on
being
in
flannels
and
so
he
hung
back
for
second
after
second
playing
with
an
absurd
little
thought
that
would
come
into
his
head
and
give
him
ever
so
brief
a
respite
from
the
effort
of
facing
the
situation
and
hoping
that
harry
might
do
or
say
something
to
open
the
ball
this
did
not
happen
he
felt
that
the
longer
he
waited
the
harder
it
would
be
he
must
begin
himself
so
he
raised
his
head
gently
and
took
a
sidelong
look
at
harry
face
to
see
whether
he
could
not
get
some
hint
for
starting
from
it
but
scarcely
had
he
brought
his
eyes
to
bear
when
they
met
harry
peering
dolefully
up
from
under
his
eyebrows
on
which
the
water
was
standing
unwiped
while
a
piece
of
green
weed
which
he
did
not
seem
to
have
presence
of
mind
enough
to
remove
trailed
over
his
dripping
locks
there
was
something
in
the
sight
which
tickled
tom
sense
of
humor
he
had
been
prepared
for
sullen
black
looks
and
fierce
words
instead
of
which
he
was
irresistibly
reminded
of
schoolboys
caught
by
their
master
using
a
crib
or
in
other
like
flagrant
delict
harry
lowered
his
eyes
at
once
but
lifted
them
the
next
moment
with
a
look
of
surprise
as
he
heard
tom
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
after
a
short
struggle
to
keep
serious
he
joined
in
it
himself
by
jove
though
harry
it
no
laughing
matter
tom
said
at
last
getting
on
to
his
legs
and
giving
himself
a
shake
harry
only
replied
by
looking
most
doleful
again
and
picking
the
weed
out
of
his
hair
as
he
too
got
up
what
in
the
world
to
be
done
i
sure
i
do
know
master
tom
i
very
much
surprised
to
find
you
at
this
work
harry
i
sure
so
be
i
to
find
you
master
tom
tom
was
not
prepared
for
this
line
of
rejoinder
it
seemed
to
be
made
with
perfect
innocence
and
yet
it
put
him
in
a
corner
at
once
he
did
not
care
to
inquire
into
the
reason
of
surprise
or
to
what
work
he
alluded
so
he
went
off
on
another
tack
let
us
walk
up
and
down
a
bit
to
dry
ourselves
now
harry
you
speak
to
me
openly
man
to
man
as
an
old
friend
should
wo
you
ay
master
tom
and
glad
to
do
it
how
long
have
you
taken
to
poaching
since
last
michaelmas
when
they
turned
me
out
o
our
cottage
and
tuk
away
my
bit
o
land
and
did
all
as
they
could
to
break
me
down
who
do
you
mean
why
squire
wurley
as
was
then
not
this
one
but
the
last
and
his
lawyer
and
farmer
tester
then
it
was
through
spite
to
them
that
you
took
to
it
nay
altogether
spite
tho
i
wo
say
but
what
i
might
ha
thought
o
bein
upsides
wi
them
what
was
it
then
besides
spite
want
o
work
i
hav
had
no
a
matter
o
six
work
ever
since
last
fall
how
that
have
you
tried
for
it
well
master
tom
i
wo
tell
a
lie
about
it
i
do
see
as
i
wur
bound
to
go
round
wi
my
cap
in
my
hand
a
beggin
for
a
work
to
the
likes
o
them
they
knowed
well
enough
as
i
wur
there
ready
and
willing
to
work
and
they
knowed
as
i
wur
able
to
do
as
good
a
day
work
as
man
in
the
parish
and
been
plenty
o
work
goin
but
they
thought
as
i
should
starve
and
have
to
come
and
beg
from
one
or
on
they
would
ha
liked
to
ha
seen
me
clean
broke
down
that
wut
they
would
and
in
the
house
and
he
paused
as
if
his
thoughts
were
getting
a
little
unmanageable
but
you
might
have
gone
to
look
for
work
elsewhere
i
ca
see
as
i
had
any
call
to
leave
the
place
where
i
wur
bred
up
master
tom
that
wur
just
wut
they
wanted
why
should
i
let
drive
well
harry
i
not
going
to
blame
you
i
only
want
to
know
more
about
what
has
been
happening
to
you
that
i
may
be
able
to
advise
and
help
you
did
you
ever
try
for
work
or
go
and
tell
your
story
at
the
rectory
try
for
work
there
no
i
never
went
arter
work
there
tom
went
on
without
noticing
the
change
in
harry
tone
and
manner
then
i
think
you
ought
to
have
gone
i
know
my
cousin
miss
winter
is
so
anxious
to
help
any
man
out
of
work
and
particularly
you
for
the
whole
story
of
patty
flashed
into
his
mind
and
made
him
stop
short
and
stammer
and
look
anywhere
except
at
harry
how
he
could
have
forgotten
it
for
a
moment
in
that
company
was
a
wonder
all
his
questioning
and
patronizing
powers
went
out
of
him
and
he
felt
that
their
positions
were
changed
and
that
he
was
the
culprit
it
was
clear
that
harry
knew
nothing
yet
of
his
own
relations
with
patty
did
he
even
suspect
them
it
must
all
come
out
now
at
any
rate
for
both
their
sakes
however
it
might
end
so
he
turned
again
and
met
harry
eye
which
was
now
cold
and
keen
and
suspicious
you
knows
all
about
it
then
yes
i
know
that
you
have
been
attached
to
simon
daughter
for
a
long
time
and
that
he
is
against
it
i
wish
i
could
help
you
with
all
my
heart
in
fact
i
did
feel
my
way
towards
speaking
to
him
about
it
last
year
when
i
was
in
hopes
of
getting
you
the
gardener
place
but
i
could
see
that
i
should
do
no
good
i
heard
say
as
you
was
acquainted
with
her
when
she
was
away
yes
i
was
when
she
was
with
her
aunt
in
oxford
what
then
was
there
as
she
larnt
her
bad
ways
bad
ways
what
do
you
mean
i
means
as
she
larnt
to
dress
fine
and
to
gee
herself
airs
to
them
as
she
known
from
a
child
and
as
ha
gone
through
fire
to
please
her
i
never
saw
anything
of
the
kind
in
her
she
was
a
pleasant
lively
girl

tom
blushed
scarlet
and
lowered
his
eyes
without
answering
dost
know
is
thine
by
the
words
came
hissing
out
between
his
set
teeth
tom
put
his
hands
behind
him
expecting
to
be
struck
as
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
said
yes
it
is
mine
and
i
tell
you
again
no
harm
has
come
of
it
is
a
lie
i
knowed
how
was
and
is
thou
hast
done
it
tom
blood
tingled
in
his
veins
and
wild
words
rushed
to
his
tongue
as
he
stood
opposite
the
man
who
had
just
given
him
the
lie
and
who
waited
his
reply
with
clinched
hands
and
laboring
breast
and
fierce
eye
but
the
discipline
of
the
last
year
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
crushing
his
hands
together
behind
his
back
drew
a
long
breath
and
answered
will
you
believe
my
oath
then
i
stood
by
your
side
at
your
mother
grave
a
man
who
did
that
wo
lie
to
you
harry
i
swear
to
you
there
no
wrong
between
me
and
her
there
never
was
fault
on
her
side
i
sought
her
she
never
cared
for
me
she
does
care
for
me
as
for
that
locket
i
forced
it
on
her
i
own
i
have
wronged
her
and
wronged
you
i
have
repented
it
bitterly
i
ask
your
forgiveness
harry
for
the
sake
of
old
times
for
the
sake
of
your
mother
he
spoke
from
the
heart
and
saw
that
his
words
went
home
come
harry
he
went
on
you
won
t
turn
from
an
old
playfellow
who
owns
the
wrong
he
has
done
and
will
do
all
he
can
to
make
up
for
it
you
shake
hands
and
say
you
forgive
me
tom
paused
and
held
out
his
hand
the
poacher
face
worked
violently
for
a
moment
or
two
and
he
seemed
to
struggle
once
or
twice
to
get
his
hand
out
in
vain
at
last
he
struck
it
suddenly
into
tom
turning
his
head
away
at
the
same
time
is
what
mother
would
ha
done
he
said
thou
cass
say
more
there
tis
then
though
i
never
thought
to
this
curious
and
unexpected
explanation
brought
thus
to
a
happy
issue
put
tom
into
high
spirits
and
at
once
roused
the
power
within
him
which
was
always
ready
enough
to
wake
up
his
first
care
was
to
persuade
harry
that
he
had
better
give
up
poaching
and
in
this
he
had
much
less
difficulty
than
he
expected
harry
owned
himself
sick
of
the
life
he
was
leading
already
he
admitted
that
some
of
the
men
with
whom
he
had
been
associating
more
or
less
for
the
last
year
were
the
greatest
blackguards
in
the
neighborhood
he
asked
nothing
better
than
to
get
out
of
it
but
how
this
was
all
tom
wanted
he
would
see
to
that
nothing
could
be
easier
i
shall
go
with
you
back
to
englebourn
this
morning
i
just
leave
a
note
for
wurley
to
say
that
i
be
back
some
time
in
the
day
to
explain
matters
to
him
and
then
we
will
be
off
at
once
we
shall
be
at
the
rectory
by
breakfast
time
ah
i
forgot
well
you
can
stop
at
david
while
i
go
and
speak
to
my
uncle
and
to
miss
winter
harry
did
seem
to
see
what
would
be
the
good
of
this
and
david
he
said
was
not
so
friendly
to
him
as
he
had
been
then
you
must
wait
at
the
red
lion
do
see
the
good
of
it
why
of
course
the
good
of
it
is
that
you
must
be
set
right
with
the
englebourn
people
that
the
first
thing
to
do
i
shall
explain
how
the
case
stands
to
my
uncle
and
i
know
that
i
can
get
him
to
let
you
have
your
land
again
if
you
stay
in
the
parish
even
if
he
ca
give
you
work
himself
but
what
he
must
do
is
to
take
you
up
to
show
people
that
he
is
your
friend
harry
well
then
if
you
can
get
good
work
mind
it
must
be
real
good
regular
work
at
farmer
grove
or
one
of
the
best
farmers
stop
here
by
all
means
and
i
will
myself
take
the
first
cottage
which
falls
vacant
and
let
you
have
it
and
meantime
you
must
lodge
with
old
david
oh
i
go
and
talk
him
round
never
fear
but
if
you
ca
get
regular
work
here
why
you
go
off
with
flying
colors
no
sneaking
off
under
a
cloud
and
leaving
no
address
you
go
off
with
me
as
my
servant
if
you
like
but
just
as
you
please
about
that
at
any
rate
you
go
with
me
and
i
take
care
that
it
shall
be
known
that
i
consider
you
as
an
old
friend
my
father
has
always
got
plenty
of
work
and
will
take
you
on
and
then
harry
after
a
bit
you
may
be
sure
all
will
go
right
and
i
shall
be
your
best
man
and
dance
at
your
wedding
before
a
year
out
there
is
something
in
this
kind
of
thing
which
is
contagious
and
irresistible
tom
thoroughly
believed
all
that
he
was
saying
and
faith
even
of
such
a
poor
kind
as
believing
in
one
own
castles
has
its
reward
common
sense
in
vain
suggested
to
harry
that
all
the
clouds
which
had
been
gathering
round
him
for
a
year
were
not
likely
to
melt
away
in
a
morning
prudence
suggested
that
the
sooner
he
got
away
the
better
which
suggestion
indeed
he
handed
on
for
what
it
was
worth
but
tom
treated
prudence
with
sublime
contempt
they
would
go
together
he
said
as
soon
as
any
one
was
up
at
the
house
just
to
let
him
in
to
change
his
things
and
write
a
note
harry
need
fear
any
unpleasant
consequences
wurley
was
an
fellow
at
bottom
and
would
mind
a
few
fish
talking
of
fish
where
was
the
one
he
heard
kicking
just
now
as
harry
hauled
in
the
line
they
went
to
the
place
and
looking
in
the
long
grass
soon
found
the
dead
trout
still
on
the
of
which
the
other
end
remained
in
the
water
tom
seized
hold
of
it
and
pulling
it
carefully
in
landed
landed
another
fine
trout
while
harry
stood
by
looking
rather
sheepish
tom
inspected
the
method
of
the
lines
which
was
simple
but
awfully
destructive
the
line
was
long
enough
to
reach
across
the
stream
at
one
end
was
a
heavy
stone
at
the
other
a
short
stake
cut
sharp
and
driven
into
the
bank
well
under
the
water
at
intervals
of
four
feet
along
the
line
short
pieces
of
fine
gimp
were
fastened
ending
in
hooks
baited
alternately
with
and
gudgeon
tom
complimented
his
companion
on
the
killing
nature
of
his
where
are
your
other
lines
harry
he
asked
we
may
as
well
go
and
take
them
up
a
bit
higher
up
stream
master
tom
and
so
they
walked
up
stream
and
took
up
the
other
lines
they
have
the
finest
dish
of
fish
they
seen
this
long
time
at
the
house
said
tom
as
each
line
came
out
with
two
or
three
fine
fish
on
it
i
you
what
harry
they
deuced
well
set
these
lines
of
yours
and
do
you
credit
they
do
i
not
complimenting
you
i
should
rather
like
to
be
off
master
tom
if
you
do
object
the
mornin
gettin
on
and
the
men
will
be
about
be
unked
for
i
to
be
caught
well
harry
if
you
are
so
set
on
it
off
with
you
but
is
too
late
now
here
keeper
tom
turned
sharp
round
and
sure
enough
there
was
the
keeper
coming
down
the
bank
towards
them
and
not
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
off
so
it
is
said
tom
well
only
hold
your
tongue
and
do
just
what
i
tell
you
the
keeper
came
up
quickly
and
touching
his
hat
to
tom
looked
inquiringly
at
him
and
then
at
harry
tom
nodded
to
him
as
if
everything
were
just
as
it
should
be
he
was
taking
a
fish
off
the
last
line
having
finished
which
feat
he
threw
it
on
the
ground
by
the
rest
there
keeper
he
said
there
a
fine
dish
of
fish
now
pick
up
and
come
along
never
was
keeper
more
puzzled
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
lifting
the
little
short
hat
from
the
back
of
his
head
and
scratching
that
somewhat
thick
skull
of
his
as
his
habit
was
when
engaged
in
what
he
called
thinking
conscious
that
somebody
ought
to
be
tackled
and
that
he
the
keeper
was
being
mystified
but
quite
at
sea
as
to
how
he
was
to
set
himself
straight
wet
bai
sir
he
said
at
last
nodding
at
clothes
dampish
keeper
answered
tom
i
may
as
well
go
and
change
the
servants
will
be
up
at
the
house
by
this
time
pick
up
the
fish
and
come
along
you
do
up
the
lines
harry
the
keeper
and
harry
performed
their
tasks
looking
at
one
another
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
like
the
terriers
of
rival
butchers
when
the
carts
happen
to
stop
suddenly
in
the
street
close
to
one
another
tom
watched
them
mischievously
delighted
with
the
fun
and
then
led
the
way
up
to
the
house
when
they
came
to
the
he
turned
to
harry
and
said
stop
here
i
sha
be
ten
minutes
adding
in
an
undertone
hold
your
tongue
now
he
then
vanished
through
the
dark
door
and
hurrying
up
to
his
room
changed
as
quickly
as
he
could
he
was
within
the
ten
minutes
but
as
he
descended
the
back
stairs
in
his
dry
things
became
aware
that
his
stay
had
been
too
long
noise
and
laughter
came
up
from
the
and
shouts
of
go
it
keeper
keeper
down
no
he
bai
greeted
his
astonished
ears
he
sprang
down
the
last
steps
and
rushed
into
the
where
he
found
harry
at
his
second
wrestling
match
for
the
day
while
two
or
three
stablemen
and
a
footman
and
the
gardener
looked
on
and
cheered
the
combatants
with
the
remarks
he
had
heard
on
his
way
down
tom
made
straight
to
them
and
tapping
harry
on
the
shoulder
said
now
then
come
along
i
ready
whereupon
the
keeper
and
harry
disengaged
and
the
latter
picked
up
his
cap
you
bai
goin
sir
said
the
keeper
yes
keeper
not
along
wi
he
yes
keeper
what
bai
i
to
take
un
take
him
no
what
for
for
night
poachin
look
at
all
them
fish
said
the
keeper
indignantly
pointing
to
the
shining
heap
no
no
keeper
you
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
may
give
him
the
lines
though
harry
i
left
a
note
for
your
master
on
my
dressing
table
tom
said
turning
to
the
footman
let
him
have
it
at
breakfast
i
responsible
for
him
nodding
at
harry
i
shall
be
back
in
a
few
hours
and
now
come
along
and
to
the
keeper
astonishment
tom
left
the
accompanied
by
harry
they
were
scarcely
out
of
hearing
before
the
broke
out
into
uproarious
laughter
at
the
keeper
expense
and
much
rude
banter
was
inflicted
on
him
for
letting
the
poacher
go
but
the
keeper
mind
for
the
moment
was
full
of
other
things
disregarding
their
remarks
he
went
on
scratching
his
head
and
burst
out
at
last
with
dang
un
i
knows
i
should
ha
drowed
un
drow
your
grandmother
politely
remarked
one
of
the
stablemen
an
acquaintance
of
harry
winburn
who
knew
his
repute
as
a
wrestler
i
should
i
tell
said
the
keeper
as
he
stooped
to
gather
up
the
fish
and
to
think
as
he
should
ha
gone
off
master
be
like
any
wild
beast
when
he
hears
o
how
is
brown
doin
is
a
queer
start
for
a
like
he
to
be
goin
off
wi
a
poacher
chap
and
callin
of
un
harry
is
past
me
altogether
but
i
he
bai
right
in
and
so
soliloquizing
he
carried
off
the
fish
to
the
kitchen
meantime
on
their
walk
to
englebourn
harry
in
answer
to
inquiries
explained
that
in
his
absence
the
his
acquaintance
had
come
up
and
begun
to
talk
the
keeper
had
joined
in
and
accused
him
of
being
the
man
who
had
thrown
him
into
the
furze
bush
the
story
of
the
discomfiture
on
that
occasion
being
well
known
a
laugh
had
been
raised
in
which
harry
had
joined
this
brought
on
a
challenge
to
try
a
fall
then
and
there
which
harry
had
accepted
notwithstanding
his
long
morning
work
and
the
ducking
he
had
had
they
laughed
over
the
story
though
harry
could
not
help
expressing
his
fears
as
to
how
it
might
all
end
they
reached
englebourn
in
time
for
breakfast
tom
appeared
at
the
rectory
and
soon
he
and
katie
were
on
their
old
terms
she
was
delighted
to
find
that
he
had
had
an
explanation
with
harry
winburn
and
that
there
was
some
chance
of
bringing
that
sturdy
offender
once
more
back
into
decent
ways
more
delighted
perhaps
to
hear
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
patty
to
whom
after
breakfast
she
paid
a
visit
and
returned
in
due
time
with
the
unfortunate
locket
tom
felt
as
if
another
coil
of
the
chain
he
had
tied
about
himself
had
fallen
off
he
went
out
into
the
village
consulted
again
with
harry
and
returned
again
to
the
rectory
to
consider
what
steps
were
to
be
taken
to
get
him
work
katie
entered
into
the
matter
heartily
though
forseeing
the
difficulties
in
the
case
at
luncheon
the
rector
was
to
be
sounded
on
the
subject
of
the
allotments
but
in
the
middle
of
their
plans
they
were
startled
by
the
news
that
a
magistrate
warrant
had
arrived
in
the
village
for
the
arrest
of
harry
as
a
night
poacher
tom
returned
to
the
grange
furious
and
before
night
had
had
a
worse
quarrel
with
young
wurley
than
with
his
uncle
before
him
had
duelling
been
in
fashion
still
in
england
they
would
probably
have
fought
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
park
before
night
as
it
was
they
only
said
bitter
things
and
parted
agreeing
not
to
know
one
another
in
the
future
three
days
afterwards
at
petty
sessions
where
tom
brought
upon
himself
the
severe
censure
of
the
bench
for
his
conduct
on
the
trial
harry
winburn
was
committed
to
reading
gaol
for
three
months
readers
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
remember
the
picture
of
our
hero
mental
growth
during
the
past
year
attempted
to
be
given
in
a
late
chapter
and
the
state
of
restless
dissatisfaction
into
which
his
experiences
and
thoughts
and
readings
had
thrown
him
by
the
time
long
vacation
had
come
around
again
will
perhaps
be
prepared
for
the
catastrophe
which
ensued
on
the
conviction
and
sentence
of
harry
winburn
at
petty
sessions
hitherto
notwithstanding
the
strength
of
the
new
and
revolutionary
forces
which
were
mustering
round
it
there
had
always
been
a
citadel
holding
out
in
his
mind
garrisoned
by
all
that
was
best
in
the
toryism
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
by
loyalty
reverence
for
established
order
and
established
institutions
by
family
traditions
and
the
pride
of
an
inherited
good
name
but
now
the
walls
of
that
citadel
went
down
with
a
crash
the
garrison
being
put
to
the
sword
or
making
away
to
hide
in
an
out
of
the
way
corner
and
wait
for
a
reaction
it
was
much
easier
for
a
youngster
whose
attention
was
once
turned
to
such
subjects
as
had
been
occupying
tom
to
get
hold
of
wild
and
violent
beliefs
and
notions
in
those
days
than
now
the
state
of
europe
generally
was
far
more
dead
and
hopeless
there
were
no
wars
certainly
and
no
expectations
of
wars
but
there
was
a
dull
feeling
abroad
as
if
the
lid
were
screwed
down
on
the
nations
and
the
thing
which
had
been
however
cruel
and
heavy
and
mean
was
that
which
was
to
remain
to
the
end
england
was
better
off
than
her
neighbours
but
yet
in
bad
case
in
the
south
and
west
particularly
several
causes
had
combined
to
spread
a
very
bitter
feeling
abroad
amongst
the
agricultural
poor
first
among
these
stood
the
new
poor
law
the
provisions
of
which
were
vigorously
carried
out
in
most
districts
the
poor
had
as
yet
felt
the
harshness
only
of
the
new
system
then
the
land
was
in
many
places
in
the
hands
of
men
on
their
last
legs
the
old
sporting
farmers
who
had
begun
business
as
young
men
while
the
great
war
was
going
on
had
made
their
money
hand
over
hand
for
a
few
years
out
of
the
war
prices
and
had
tried
to
go
on
living
with
greyhounds
and
yeomanry
uniforms
horse
to
ride
and
weapon
to
wear
through
the
hard
years
which
had
followed
these
were
bad
masters
every
way
unthrifty
profligate
needy
and
the
younger
men
who
were
supplanting
them
were
introducing
machinery
threshing
machines
and
winnowing
machines
to
take
the
little
bread
which
a
poor
man
was
still
able
to
earn
out
of
the
mouths
of
his
wife
and
children
so
at
least
the
poor
thought
and
muttered
to
one
another
and
the
mutterings
broke
out
every
now
and
then
in
the
long
nights
of
the
winter
months
in
blazing
ricks
and
broken
machines
game
preserving
was
on
the
increase
australia
and
america
had
not
yet
become
familiar
words
in
every
english
village
and
the
labour
market
was
everywhere
overstocked
and
last
but
not
least
the
corn
laws
were
still
in
force
and
the
bitter
and
exasperating
strife
in
which
they
went
out
was
at
its
height
and
while
swing
and
his
myrmidons
were
abroad
in
the
counties
and
could
scarcely
be
kept
down
by
yeomanry
and
poor
law
guardians
the
great
towns
were
in
almost
worse
case
here
too
emigration
had
not
set
in
to
thin
the
labour
market
wages
were
falling
and
prices
rising
the
corn
law
struggle
was
better
understood
and
far
keener
than
in
the
country
and
chartism
was
gaining
force
every
day
and
rising
into
a
huge
threatening
giant
waiting
to
put
forth
his
strength
and
eager
for
the
occasion
which
seemed
at
hand
you
generation
of
young
englishmen
who
were
too
young
then
to
be
troubled
with
such
matters
and
have
grown
into
manhood
since
you
little
know
may
you
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
living
the
citizens
of
a
divided
and
distracted
nation
for
the
time
that
danger
is
past
in
a
happy
home
and
so
far
as
man
can
judge
in
time
and
only
just
in
time
came
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
and
the
great
cause
of
strife
and
the
sense
of
injustice
passed
away
out
of
men
minds
the
nation
was
roused
by
the
irish
famine
and
the
fearful
distress
in
other
parts
of
the
country
to
begin
looking
steadily
and
seriously
at
some
of
the
sores
which
were
festering
in
its
body
and
undermining
health
and
life
and
so
the
tide
had
turned
and
england
had
already
passed
the
critical
point
when
came
upon
christendom
and
the
whole
of
europe
leapt
up
into
a
wild
blaze
of
revolution
is
anyone
still
inclined
to
make
light
of
the
danger
that
threatened
england
in
that
year
to
sneer
at
the
of
april
and
the
monster
petition
and
the
monster
meetings
on
kennington
and
other
commons
well
if
there
be
such
persons
among
my
readers
i
can
only
say
that
they
can
have
known
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
them
and
below
them
at
that
time
and
i
earnestly
hope
that
their
vision
has
become
clearer
since
then
and
that
they
are
not
looking
with
the
same
eyes
that
see
nothing
at
the
signs
of
today
for
that
there
are
questions
still
to
be
solved
by
us
in
england
in
this
current
quite
as
likely
to
tear
the
nation
to
pieces
as
the
corn
laws
no
man
with
half
an
eye
in
his
head
can
doubt
they
may
seem
little
clouds
like
a
man
hand
on
the
horizon
just
now
but
they
will
darken
the
whole
heaven
before
long
unless
we
can
find
wisdom
enough
amongst
us
to
take
the
little
clouds
in
hand
in
time
and
make
them
descend
in
soft
rain
but
such
matters
need
not
be
spoken
of
here
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
put
my
young
readers
in
a
position
to
understand
how
it
was
that
our
hero
fell
away
into
beliefs
and
notions
at
which
grundy
and
all
decent
people
could
only
lift
up
eyes
and
hands
in
pious
and
respectable
horror
and
became
soon
after
the
incarceration
of
his
friend
for
night
poaching
little
better
than
a
physical
force
chartist
at
the
age
of
chapter
xl
hue
and
cry
at
the
end
of
a
gusty
wild
october
afternoon
a
man
leading
two
horses
was
marching
up
and
down
the
little
plot
of
short
turf
at
the
top
of
the
hawk
lynch
every
now
and
then
he
would
stop
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
to
look
over
the
village
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
somebody
from
that
quarter
after
being
well
blown
he
would
turn
to
his
promenade
again
or
go
in
under
the
clump
of
firs
through
which
the
rising
wind
rushing
up
from
the
vale
below
was
beginning
to
make
a
moan
and
hitching
the
horses
to
some
stump
or
bush
and
patting
and
coaxing
them
to
induce
them
if
so
might
be
to
stand
quiet
for
a
while
would
try
to
settle
himself
to
leeward
of
one
of
the
larger
trees
but
the
fates
were
against
all
attempts
at
repose
he
had
scarcely
time
to
produce
a
cheroot
from
his
case
and
light
it
under
many
difficulties
when
the
horses
would
begin
fidgeting
and
pulling
at
their
bridles
and
shifting
round
to
get
their
tails
to
the
wind
they
clearly
did
not
understand
the
necessity
of
the
position
and
were
inclined
to
be
moving
so
he
had
to
get
up
again
sling
the
bridles
over
his
arm
and
take
to
his
march
up
and
down
the
plot
of
turf
now
stopping
for
a
moment
or
two
to
try
to
get
his
cheroot
to
burn
straight
and
pishing
and
pshawing
over
its
perverseness
now
going
again
and
again
to
the
brow
and
looking
along
the
road
which
led
to
the
village
holding
his
hat
on
tight
with
one
hand
for
by
this
time
it
was
blowing
half
a
gale
of
wind
though
it
was
not
yet
quite
the
hour
for
his
setting
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
a
heavy
bank
of
wicked
cloud
which
looked
as
though
it
were
rising
straight
up
into
the
western
heavens
while
the
wind
whirled
along
and
twisted
into
quaint
shapes
a
ragged
rift
of
white
vapor
which
went
hurrying
by
almost
touching
the
tops
of
the
moaning
firs
altogether
an
uncanny
evening
to
be
keeping
tryst
at
the
top
of
a
wild
knoll
and
so
thought
our
friend
with
the
horses
and
showed
it
too
clearly
enough
had
anyone
been
there
to
put
a
construction
on
his
impatient
movements
there
was
no
one
nearer
than
the
village
of
which
the
nearest
house
was
half
a
mile
and
more
away
so
by
way
of
passing
the
time
we
must
exercise
our
privilege
of
putting
into
words
what
he
is
half
thinking
half
muttering
to
himself
a
pleasant
night
i
call
this
to
be
out
on
a
wild
goose
chase
if
ever
i
saw
a
screaming
storm
brewing
there
it
comes
i
be
hanged
if
i
stop
up
here
to
be
caught
in
it
for
all
the
friends
i
ever
had
in
the
world
and
i
seem
to
have
a
faculty
for
picking
up
none
but
ones
i
wonder
what
the
plague
can
keep
him
so
long
he
must
have
been
gone
an
hour
there
steady
steady
old
horse
confound
this
weed
what
rascals
these
tobacconists
are
you
never
can
get
a
cheroot
now
worth
smoking
every
one
of
them
goes
sputtering
up
the
side
or
charring
up
the
middle
and
tasting
like
tow
soaked
in
saltpetre
and
tobacco
juice
well
i
suppose
i
shall
get
the
real
thing
in
india
india
in
a
month
from
we
shall
be
off
to
hear
our
senior
major
talk
one
might
as
well
be
going
to
the
bottomless
pit
at
once
well
he
sell
out
that
a
comfort
gives
us
a
step
and
gets
rid
of
an
old
ruffian
i
do
seem
to
care
much
what
the
place
is
like
if
we
only
get
some
work
and
there
will
be
some
work
there
before
long
by
all
accounts
no
more
life
at
any
rate
and
if
i
have
any
luck
a
man
may
get
a
chance
there
what
the
deuce
can
he
be
about
this
all
comes
of
sentiment
now
why
could
i
go
quietly
off
to
india
without
bothering
up
to
oxford
to
see
him
not
but
what
it
a
pleasant
place
enough
i
enjoyed
my
three
days
there
uncommonly
food
and
drink
all
that
can
be
wished
and
plenty
of
good
fellows
and
fun
the
look
of
the
place
too
makes
one
feel
respectable
but
by
george
if
their
divinity
is
at
all
like
their
politics
they
must
turn
out
a
queer
set
of
parsons
at
least
if
brown
picked
up
his
precious
notions
at
oxford
he
always
was
a
headstrong
beggar
what
was
it
he
was
holding
forth
about
last
night
let
see
sacred
right
of
insurrection
yes
that
was
it
and
he
talked
as
if
he
believed
it
all
too
and
if
there
should
be
a
row
which
seem
unlikely
by
jove
i
think
he
act
on
it
in
the
sort
of
temper
he
in
how
about
the
sacred
right
of
getting
hung
or
transported
i
should
wonder
to
hear
of
that
some
day
gad
suppose
he
should
be
in
for
an
installment
of
his
sacred
right
he
capable
of
it
and
of
lugging
me
in
with
him
what
did
he
say
we
were
come
here
for
to
get
some
fellow
out
of
a
scrape
he
said
some
sort
of
poaching
radical
of
his
who
had
been
in
gaol
and
deserved
it
too
i
be
bound
and
he
could
go
down
quietly
into
the
village
and
put
up
at
the
public
where
i
might
have
set
in
the
tap
and
not
run
the
chance
of
having
my
skin
blown
over
my
ears
and
my
teeth
down
my
throat
on
this
cursed
place
because
he
well
there
what
does
that
mean
upon
my
soul
it
looks
bad
they
may
be
lynching
a
down
there
or
making
a
spread
eagle
of
the
parish
constable
at
this
minute
for
anything
i
know
and
as
sure
as
fate
if
they
are
i
shall
get
my
foot
in
it
it
will
read
sweetly
in
the
naval
and
military
intelligence
was
held
this
day
at
chatham
president
colonel
smith
of
her
majesty
regiment
to
try
henry
east
a
lieutenant
in
the
same
distinguished
corps
who
has
been
under
arrest
since
the
for
aiding
and
abetting
the
escape
of
a
convict
and
taking
part
in
a
riot
in
the
village
of
englebourn
in
the
county
of
berks
the
defense
of
the
accused
was
that
he
had
a
sentimental
friendship
for
a
certain
thomas
brown
an
undergraduate
of
ambrose
college
oxford
and
the
sentence
of
the
court
hang
it
it
no
laughing
matter
many
a
fellow
has
been
broken
for
not
making
half
such
a
fool
of
himself
as
i
have
done
coming
out
here
on
this
errand
i
tell
a
bit
of
my
mind
as
sure
as
hullo
did
i
hear
a
shout
only
the
wind
i
believe
how
it
does
blow
one
of
these
firs
will
be
down
i
expect
just
now
the
storm
will
burst
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
here
goes
i
shall
ride
down
into
the
village
let
what
will
come
of
it
steady
now
steady
stand
still
you
old
fool
ca
you
there
now
i
all
right
solomon
said
something
about
a
beggar
on
horseback
was
is
solomon
though
never
mind
he
ride
never
had
a
horse
till
he
was
grown
up
but
he
said
some
uncommon
wise
things
about
having
to
do
with
such
friends
as
b
so
harry
east
if
you
please
no
more
tomfoolery
after
you
got
a
whole
skin
and
a
lieutenant
commission
to
make
your
way
in
the
world
with
and
are
troubled
with
no
particular
crotchets
yourself
that
need
ever
get
you
into
trouble
so
just
you
keep
clear
of
other
people
and
if
your
friends
must
be
mending
the
world
and
poor
men
plastering
and
running
their
heads
against
stone
walls
why
just
you
let
go
of
their
coat
tails
so
muttering
and
meditating
harry
east
paused
a
moment
after
mounting
to
turn
up
the
collar
of
the
rough
which
he
was
wearing
and
button
it
up
to
the
chin
before
riding
down
the
hill
when
in
the
of
the
wind
a
shout
came
spinning
past
his
ears
plain
enough
this
time
he
heard
the
gate
at
the
end
of
englebourn
lane
down
below
him
shut
with
a
clang
and
saw
two
men
running
at
full
speed
towards
him
straight
up
the
hill
oh
here
you
are
at
last
he
said
as
he
watched
them
well
you
do
lose
your
time
now
somebody
must
be
after
them
he
shouting
and
waving
his
hand
for
oh
i
to
bring
the
cavalry
supports
down
the
slope
i
suppose
well
here
goes
he
has
brought
off
his
pal
the
convict
i
see
says
he
you
from
transportation
all
upon
the
briny
main
so
never
give
way
to
no
temptation
and
do
get
drunk
nor
prig
again
there
goes
the
gate
again
by
jove
what
that
dragoons
as
a
sinner
there
going
to
be
the
d
saying
which
harry
east
dug
his
heels
into
his
horse
sides
holding
him
up
sharply
with
the
curb
at
the
same
time
and
in
another
moment
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
solitary
mound
on
which
he
had
been
perched
for
the
last
hour
and
on
the
brow
of
the
line
of
hill
out
of
which
it
rose
so
abruptly
just
at
the
point
for
which
the
two
runners
were
making
he
had
only
time
to
glance
at
the
pursuers
and
saw
that
one
or
two
rode
straight
on
the
track
of
the
fugitives
while
the
rest
skirted
away
along
a
parish
road
which
led
up
the
hill
side
by
an
easier
ascent
when
tom
and
his
companion
were
by
his
side
tom
seized
the
bridle
of
the
led
horse
and
was
in
the
saddle
with
one
spring
jump
up
behind
he
shouted
now
then
come
along
who
are
they
roared
east
in
that
wind
nothing
but
a
shout
could
be
heard
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
as
they
turned
to
the
heath
yeomanry
after
you
tom
nodded
as
they
broke
into
a
gallop
making
straight
across
the
heath
towards
the
oxford
road
they
were
some
quarter
of
a
mile
in
advance
before
any
of
their
pursuers
showed
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
behind
them
it
was
already
getting
dusk
and
the
great
bank
of
cloud
was
by
this
time
all
but
upon
them
making
the
atmosphere
denser
and
darker
every
second
then
first
one
of
the
men
appeared
who
had
ridden
straight
up
the
hill
under
the
hawk
lynch
and
pulling
up
for
a
moment
caught
sight
of
them
and
gave
chase
half
a
minute
later
and
several
of
those
who
had
kept
to
the
road
were
also
in
sight
some
distance
away
on
the
left
but
still
near
enough
to
be
unpleasant
and
they
too
after
a
moment
pause
were
in
full
pursuit
at
first
the
fugitives
held
their
own
and
the
distance
between
them
and
their
pursuers
was
not
lessened
but
it
was
clear
that
this
could
not
last
anything
that
is
capable
of
a
real
good
oxford
hack
such
as
they
rode
will
do
but
to
carry
two
men
at
the
end
of
a
pretty
long
day
away
from
fresh
horses
and
moderate
weights
is
too
much
to
expect
even
of
oxford
and
the
gallant
beast
which
tom
rode
was
beginning
to
show
signs
of
distress
when
they
struck
into
the
road
there
was
a
slight
dip
in
the
ground
a
this
place
and
a
little
further
on
the
heath
rose
suddenly
again
and
the
road
ran
between
high
banks
for
a
short
distance
as
they
reached
this
point
they
disappeared
for
the
moment
from
the
yeomanry
and
the
force
of
the
wind
was
broken
by
the
banks
so
that
they
could
breathe
more
easily
and
hear
one
voices
tom
looked
anxiously
round
at
the
lieutenant
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
answer
to
the
look
as
he
bent
forward
to
ease
his
own
horse
and
said
ca
last
another
mile
what
to
be
done
east
again
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
said
nothing
i
know
master
tom
said
harry
winburn
what
pull
up
a
bit
sir
tom
pulled
up
and
his
horse
fell
into
a
walk
willingly
enough
while
east
passed
on
a
few
strides
ahead
harry
winburn
sprang
off
you
ride
on
now
master
tom
he
said
i
knows
the
heath
well
you
let
me
bide
no
no
harry
not
i
wo
leave
you
now
so
let
them
come
and
be
hanged
east
had
pulled
up
and
listened
to
their
talk
look
here
now
he
said
to
harry
put
your
arm
over
the
hind
part
of
his
saddle
and
run
by
the
side
you
find
you
can
go
as
fast
as
the
horse
now
you
two
push
on
and
strike
across
the
heath
i
keep
the
road
and
take
off
this
joker
behind
who
is
the
only
dangerous
customer
that
like
you
old
boy
said
tom
then
we
meet
at
the
first
public
beyond
the
heath
they
passed
ahead
in
their
turn
and
turned
on
to
the
heath
harry
running
by
the
side
as
the
lieutenant
had
advised
east
looked
after
them
and
then
put
his
horse
into
a
steady
trot
muttering
like
me
yes
devilish
like
me
i
know
that
well
enough
i
always
play
to
his
monkey
at
school
but
that
convict
do
seem
such
a
bad
lot
after
all
meantime
tom
and
harry
struck
away
over
the
heath
as
the
darkness
closed
in
and
the
storm
drove
down
they
stumbled
on
over
the
charred
furze
roots
and
splashed
through
the
sloppy
peat
cuttings
casting
anxious
hasty
looks
over
their
shoulders
as
they
fled
straining
every
nerve
to
get
on
and
longing
for
night
and
the
storm
hark
was
that
a
said
tom
as
they
floundered
on
the
sound
came
from
the
road
they
had
left
look
here
some
on
then
said
harry
and
tom
was
aware
of
two
horsemen
coming
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
on
their
left
some
three
hundred
yards
to
the
rear
at
the
same
instant
his
horse
stumbled
and
came
down
on
his
nose
and
knees
tom
went
off
over
his
shoulder
tumbling
against
harry
and
sending
him
headlong
to
the
ground
but
keeping
hold
of
the
bridle
they
were
up
again
in
a
moment
are
you
hurt
no
come
along
then
and
tom
was
in
the
saddle
again
when
the
pursuers
raised
a
shout
they
had
caught
sight
of
them
now
and
spurred
down
the
slope
towards
them
tom
was
turning
his
head
straight
away
but
harry
shouted
keep
to
the
left
master
tom
to
the
left
right
on
it
seemed
like
running
into
the
lion
jaws
but
he
yielded
and
they
pushed
on
down
the
slope
on
which
they
were
another
shout
of
triumph
rose
on
the
howling
wind
tom
heart
sank
within
him
the
enemy
was
closing
on
them
at
every
stride
another
hundred
yards
and
they
must
meet
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
what
could
harry
be
dreaming
of
the
thought
had
scarcely
time
to
cross
his
brain
when
down
went
the
two
yeomen
horse
and
man
floundering
in
a
bog
above
their
horses
girths
at
the
same
moment
the
storm
burst
on
them
the
driving
mist
and
pelting
rain
the
chase
was
over
they
could
not
have
seen
a
regiment
of
men
at
fifty
distance
you
let
me
lead
the
horse
master
tom
shouted
harry
winburn
i
knowed
where
they
was
going
take
they
the
best
part
the
night
to
get
out
o
that
i
knows
all
right
let
get
back
to
the
road
then
as
soon
as
we
can
said
tom
surrendering
his
horse
head
to
harry
and
turning
up
his
collar
to
meet
the
pitiless
deluge
which
was
driving
on
their
flanks
they
were
drenched
to
the
skin
in
two
minutes
tom
jumped
off
and
plodded
along
on
the
opposite
side
of
his
horse
to
harry
they
did
not
speak
there
was
very
little
to
be
said
under
the
circumstances
and
a
great
deal
to
be
thought
about
harry
winburn
probably
knew
the
heath
as
well
as
any
man
living
but
even
he
had
much
difficulty
in
finding
his
way
back
to
the
road
through
that
storm
however
after
some
spent
in
beating
about
they
reached
it
and
turned
their
faces
northwards
towards
oxford
by
this
time
night
had
come
on
but
the
fury
of
the
storm
had
passed
over
them
and
the
moon
began
to
show
every
now
and
then
through
the
driving
clouds
at
last
tom
roused
himself
out
of
the
brown
study
in
which
he
had
been
hitherto
plodding
along
and
turned
down
his
coat
collar
and
shook
himself
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
across
at
his
companion
who
was
still
leading
the
horse
along
mechanically
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
but
his
walk
and
general
look
were
listless
and
dogged
at
last
tom
broke
silence
you
promised
not
to
do
anything
after
you
came
out
without
speaking
to
me
harry
made
no
reply
so
presently
he
went
on
i
did
think
you
have
gone
in
for
such
a
business
as
that
i
should
have
minded
so
much
if
it
had
only
been
but
robbing
the
cellar
and
staving
in
the
ale
casks
and
maiming
cattle
i
no
hand
in
that
interrupted
harry
i
glad
to
hear
it
you
were
certainly
leaning
against
the
gate
when
i
came
up
and
taking
no
part
in
it
but
you
were
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
riot
he
brought
it
on
hisself
said
harry
doggedly
tester
is
a
bad
man
i
know
that
and
the
people
have
much
to
complain
of
but
nothing
can
justify
what
was
done
harry
made
no
answer
you
known
and
they
be
after
you
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
is
very
little
odds
what
happens
to
me
you
no
right
to
say
that
harry
your
friends
i
ai
got
no
friends
well
harry
i
do
think
you
ought
to
say
that
after
what
has
happened
i
do
mean
to
say
that
my
friendship
has
done
you
much
good
yet
but
i
done
what
i
could
and
so
you
hev
master
tom
so
you
hev
and
i
stick
by
you
through
thick
and
thin
harry
but
you
must
take
heart
and
stick
by
yourself
or
we
shall
never
pull
you
through
harry
groaned
and
then
turning
at
once
to
what
was
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
said
is
no
good
now
i
been
in
gaol
her
father
wur
allus
agin
me
and
now
how
be
i
ever
to
hold
up
my
head
at
whoam
i
seen
her
once
arter
i
came
out
well
and
what
happened
said
tom
after
waiting
a
moment
or
two
she
just
turned
red
and
pale
and
was
all
flustered
like
and
made
as
though
she
have
held
out
her
hand
and
then
tuk
and
hurried
off
like
a
frightened
hare
as
though
she
heerd
somebody
comin
ah
is
no
good
is
no
good
i
do
see
anything
very
hopeless
in
that
said
tom
i
knowed
her
since
she
wur
that
high
went
on
harry
holding
out
his
hand
about
as
high
as
the
bottom
of
his
waistcoat
without
noticing
the
interruption
when
her
and
i
went
together
is
what
i
thought
on
and
lived
for
is
four
year
and
better
since
she
and
i
broke
a
sixpence
and
at
times
it
sim
as
tho
all
cum
right
when
my
poor
mother
wur
livin
tho
her
never
tuk
to
it
kindly
mother
did
but
all
gone
now
and
i
be
that
mad
wi
myself
and
mammered
and
down
i
be
ready
to
hang
myself
master
tom
and
if
they
just
teks
and
transports
me
oh
nonsense
harry
you
must
keep
out
of
that
we
shall
think
of
some
way
to
get
you
out
of
that
before
morning
and
you
must
get
clear
away
and
go
to
work
on
the
railways
or
somewhere
there
nothing
to
be
downhearted
about
as
far
as
patty
is
concerned
ah
is
they
as
wears
it
as
knows
where
the
shoe
pinches
say
different
if
was
you
master
tom
should
i
said
tom
and
after
pausing
a
moment
or
two
he
went
on
what
i
going
to
say
is
in
confidence
i
never
told
it
to
any
man
yet
and
only
one
has
found
it
out
now
harry
much
worse
off
than
you
are
at
this
minute
do
i
know
where
the
shoe
pinches
why
i
have
seen
i
scarcely
heard
of
of
well
of
my
sweetheart
there
you
understand
that
for
this
year
and
more
i
do
know
when
i
may
see
her
again
i
do
know
that
she
has
clean
forgotten
me
i
know
that
she
ever
cared
a
straw
for
me
now
you
know
quite
well
that
you
are
better
off
than
that
i
bea
so
sure
o
that
master
tom
but
i
be
terrible
vexed
to
hear
about
you
never
mind
about
me
you
say
you
not
sure
harry
come
now
you
said
not
two
minutes
ago
that
you
two
had
broken
a
sixpence
over
it
what
does
that
mean
now
ah
but
is
four
years
gone
her
been
a
leadin
o
me
up
and
down
and
a
dancin
o
me
round
and
round
purty
nigh
ever
since
let
alone
the
time
as
she
wur
at
oxford
when
well
we
wo
talk
of
that
harry
come
will
yesterday
do
for
you
if
you
thought
she
was
all
right
yesterday
would
that
satisfy
you
ees
and
summat
to
spare
you
do
believe
it
i
see
well
why
do
you
think
i
came
after
you
how
did
i
know
what
was
going
on
that
just
what
i
been
o
myself
as
we
cum
along
well
then
i
tell
you
i
came
because
i
got
a
note
from
her
yesterday
at
oxford
tom
paused
for
he
heard
a
muttered
growl
from
the
other
side
of
the
horse
head
and
could
see
even
in
the
fitful
moonlight
the
angry
toss
of
the
head
with
which
his
news
was
received
i
did
expect
this
harry
he
went
on
presently
after
what
i
told
you
just
now
about
myself
it
was
a
hard
matter
to
tell
it
at
all
but
after
telling
you
i
think
you
suspect
me
any
more
however
perhaps
i
deserved
it
so
to
go
on
with
what
i
was
saying
two
years
ago
when
i
came
to
my
senses
about
her
and
before
i
cared
for
anyone
else
i
told
her
to
write
if
ever
i
could
do
her
a
service
anything
that
a
man
could
do
for
his
sister
i
was
bound
to
do
for
her
and
i
told
her
so
she
never
answered
till
yesterday
when
i
got
this
note
and
he
dived
into
the
inner
breast
pocket
of
his
shooting
coat
if
it
is
soaked
to
pulp
it
in
my
pocket
now
yes
here
it
is
and
he
produced
a
dirty
piece
of
paper
and
handed
it
across
to
his
companion
when
there
light
enough
to
read
it
you
see
plain
enough
what
she
means
though
your
name
is
not
mentioned
having
finished
his
statement
tom
retired
into
himself
and
walked
along
watching
the
hurrying
clouds
after
they
had
gone
some
hundred
yards
harry
cleared
his
throat
once
or
twice
and
at
last
broke
out
master
tom
well
you
bea
offended
wi
me
sir
i
hopes
no
why
should
i
be
offended
i
knows
i
be
so
jealous
i
ca
to
hear
o
her
talkin
let
alone
writin
to
out
with
it
to
me
you
were
going
to
say
nay
is
mwore
nor
that
all
right
harry
if
you
only
lump
me
with
the
rest
of
mankind
i
do
care
but
you
need
be
jealous
of
me
and
you
be
jealous
of
me
or
i
be
able
to
help
you
as
i
want
to
do
i
give
you
my
hand
and
word
on
it
as
man
to
man
no
thought
in
my
heart
towards
her
that
you
might
see
this
minute
do
you
believe
me
ees
and
you
forgive
there
nothing
to
forgive
harry
but
now
you
allow
your
case
is
such
a
bad
one
she
must
keep
a
good
lookout
after
you
to
know
what
you
were
likely
to
be
about
and
if
she
did
care
for
you
she
would
have
written
to
me
that
good
sense
i
think
harry
assented
and
then
tom
went
into
a
consideration
of
what
was
to
be
done
and
as
usual
fair
castles
began
to
rise
in
the
air
harry
was
to
start
down
the
line
at
once
and
take
work
on
the
railway
in
a
few
weeks
he
would
be
captain
of
a
gang
and
then
what
was
to
hinder
his
becoming
a
contractor
and
making
his
fortune
and
buying
a
farm
of
his
own
at
englebourn
to
all
which
harry
listened
with
open
ears
till
they
got
off
the
heath
and
came
upon
a
small
hamlet
of
some
cottages
scattered
along
the
road
there
a
public
here
i
suppose
said
tom
returning
to
the
damp
realities
of
life
harry
indicated
the
humble
place
of
entertainment
for
man
and
horse
that
all
right
i
hope
we
shall
find
my
friend
here
and
they
went
towards
the
light
which
was
shining
temptingly
through
the
latticed
window
of
the
inn
chapter
xli
the
lieutenant
sentiments
and
problems
stop
it
looks
so
bright
that
there
must
be
something
going
on
surely
the
yeomanry
can
never
have
come
on
here
already
tom
laid
his
hand
on
the
bridle
and
they
halted
on
the
road
opposite
the
which
lay
a
little
back
with
an
open
space
of
ground
before
it
the
and
a
long
for
the
horses
of
guests
to
drink
at
were
pushed
forward
to
the
side
of
road
to
intimate
the
whereabouts
of
the
house
and
the
hack
which
harry
led
was
already
drinking
eagerly
stay
here
for
a
minute
and
i
go
to
the
window
and
see
what
up
inside
it
very
unlucky
but
it
will
never
do
for
us
to
go
in
if
there
are
any
people
there
tom
stole
softly
up
to
the
window
out
of
which
the
light
came
a
little
scrap
of
a
curtain
was
drawn
across
a
portion
of
it
but
he
could
see
easily
into
the
room
on
either
side
of
the
curtain
the
first
glance
comforted
him
for
he
saw
at
once
that
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
kitchen
but
who
and
what
he
might
be
was
a
puzzle
the
only
thing
which
was
clear
at
a
first
glance
was
that
he
was
making
himself
at
home
the
room
was
a
kitchen
with
a
sanded
floor
and
a
large
a
high
wooden
screen
with
a
narrow
seat
in
front
of
it
ran
along
the
side
on
which
the
door
from
the
opened
in
the
middle
there
was
a
long
rough
walnut
table
on
which
stood
a
large
loaf
some
cold
bacon
and
cheese
and
a
yellow
jug
a
few
heavy
chairs
and
a
settle
composed
the
rest
of
the
furniture
on
the
wall
were
a
few
samplers
a
warming
pan
and
shelves
with
some
common
delf
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
but
though
the
furniture
was
meagre
enough
the
kitchen
had
a
look
of
wondrous
comfort
for
a
drenched
mortal
outside
tom
felt
this
keenly
and
after
a
glance
round
fixed
his
attention
on
the
happy
occupant
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
he
would
be
a
safe
person
to
intrude
on
under
the
circumstances
he
was
seated
on
a
low
oak
seat
with
his
back
to
the
window
steadying
a
furze
fagot
on
the
fire
with
the
poker
the
fagot
blazed
and
crackled
and
roared
up
the
chimney
sending
out
the
bright
flickering
light
which
had
attracted
them
and
forming
a
glorious
top
to
the
glowing
clear
fire
of
wood
embers
beneath
into
which
was
inserted
a
long
tin
out
of
which
the
figure
helped
himself
to
some
warm
compound
when
he
had
settled
the
fagot
to
his
satisfaction
he
was
enveloped
as
to
his
shoulders
in
a
heavy
coat
with
huge
cape
and
high
collar
which
hid
the
back
of
his
head
such
as
was
then
in
use
by
country
carriers
but
the
garment
was
much
too
short
for
him
and
his
bare
arms
came
out
a
foot
beyond
the
end
of
the
sleeves
the
rest
of
his
costume
was
even
more
eccentric
being
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
coarse
flannel
petticoat
and
his
bare
feet
rested
on
the
mat
in
front
of
the
fire
tom
felt
a
sudden
doubt
as
to
his
sanity
which
doubt
was
apparently
shared
by
the
widow
woman
who
kept
the
house
and
her
one
or
other
of
whom
might
be
seen
constantly
keeping
an
eye
on
their
guest
from
behind
the
end
of
the
wooden
screen
however
it
was
no
time
to
be
over
particular
they
must
rest
before
going
further
and
after
all
it
was
only
one
man
so
tom
thought
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
calling
harry
to
come
on
when
the
figure
turned
round
towards
the
window
and
the
face
of
the
lieutenant
disclosed
itself
between
the
gills
of
the
carrier
coat
tom
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
and
called
out
it
all
right
come
along
i
just
look
to
the
hosses
master
tom
very
well
and
then
come
into
the
kitchen
saying
which
he
hurried
into
the
house
and
after
tumbling
against
the
in
the
passage
emerged
from
behind
the
screen
well
here
we
are
at
last
old
fellow
he
said
slapping
east
on
the
shoulder
oh
it
you
is
it
i
thought
you
were
in
the
by
this
time
east
costume
as
he
sat
looking
up
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
was
even
more
ridiculous
on
a
close
inspection
and
tom
roared
with
laughter
again
i
do
see
the
joke
said
east
without
moving
a
muscle
you
would
though
if
you
could
see
yourself
you
wonderful
old
guy
where
did
you
pick
up
that
toggery
the
late
lamented
husband
of
the
widow
higgs
our
landlady
was
the
owner
of
the
coat
he
also
bequeathed
to
her
several
pairs
of
breeches
which
i
have
vainly
endeavored
to
get
into
the
late
lamented
higgs
was
an
abominably
small
man
he
must
have
been
very
much
her
worse
half
so
in
default
of
other
clothing
the
widow
has
kindly
obliged
me
by
the
loan
of
one
of
her
own
garments
where
are
your
own
clothes
there
said
east
pointing
to
a
clothes
horse
which
tom
had
not
hitherto
remarked
which
stood
well
into
the
chimney
corner
and
they
are
dry
too
he
went
on
feeling
them
at
least
the
flannel
shirt
and
trousers
are
so
i
get
into
them
again
i
say
he
called
out
addressing
the
screen
i
going
to
change
my
things
so
you
had
better
not
look
in
just
now
in
fact
we
can
call
now
if
we
want
anything
at
this
strong
hint
the
widow
higgs
was
heard
bustling
away
behind
the
screen
and
after
her
departure
east
got
into
some
of
his
own
clothes
again
offering
the
garments
of
the
higgs
family
to
tom
who
however
declined
contenting
himself
with
taking
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
hanging
them
upon
the
horse
he
had
been
blown
comparatively
dry
in
the
last
of
his
walk
while
east
was
making
his
toilet
tom
turned
to
the
table
and
made
an
assault
on
the
bread
and
bacon
and
then
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
beer
and
began
to
drink
it
but
was
pulled
up
half
way
and
put
it
down
with
a
face
all
drawn
up
into
puckers
by
its
sharpness
i
thought
you
would
appreciate
the
widow
tap
said
east
watching
him
with
a
grin
regular
vengeance
and
no
mistake
here
i
do
mind
giving
you
some
of
my
compound
though
you
do
deserve
it
so
tom
drew
his
chair
to
the
fire
and
smacked
his
lips
over
the
glass
which
east
handed
to
him
ah
that
not
bad
tipple
after
such
a
ducking
as
we
had
is
it
east
nodded
well
old
fellow
i
will
say
you
are
the
best
hand
i
know
at
making
the
most
of
your
opportunities
i
do
know
of
anyone
else
who
could
have
made
such
a
good
brew
out
of
that
stuff
and
a
drop
of
gin
east
was
not
to
be
mollified
by
any
such
compliment
have
you
got
many
more
such
jobs
as
on
hand
i
should
think
they
must
interfere
with
reading
no
but
i
call
a
real
good
job
do
you
i
do
agree
of
course
it
a
matter
of
taste
i
have
the
honor
of
holding
her
majesty
commission
so
i
may
be
prejudiced
perhaps
what
difference
does
it
make
whose
commission
you
hold
you
would
hold
any
commission
i
know
which
would
bind
you
to
be
a
tyrant
and
oppress
the
weak
and
the
poor
humbug
about
your
oppressing
who
is
the
tyrant
i
should
like
to
know
the
farmer
or
the
mob
that
destroys
his
property
i
do
call
swing
mob
the
weak
and
the
poor
that
all
very
well
but
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
feel
if
you
had
no
work
and
a
starving
family
you
do
know
what
people
have
to
suffer
the
only
wonder
is
that
all
the
country
is
in
a
blaze
and
it
will
be
if
things
last
as
they
are
much
longer
it
must
be
a
bad
time
which
makes
such
men
as
harry
winburn
into
rioters
i
do
know
anything
about
harry
winburn
but
i
know
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
the
yeomanry
side
of
the
question
well
now
east
just
consider
no
i
not
in
the
humour
for
considering
i
do
want
to
argue
with
you
yes
that
always
the
way
you
wo
hear
what
a
fellow
got
to
say
and
then
set
him
down
for
a
mischievous
fool
because
he
wo
give
up
beliefs
founded
on
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
and
ears
and
reason
i
do
quarrel
with
any
of
your
beliefs
you
got
i
have
that
just
the
difference
between
us
you
got
some
sort
of
faith
to
fall
back
upon
in
equality
and
brotherhood
and
a
lot
of
cursed
nonsense
of
that
kind
so
i
daresay
you
could
drop
down
into
a
navigator
or
a
shoeblack
or
something
in
that
way
and
think
it
pleasant
you
might
rather
enjoy
a
trip
across
the
water
at
the
expense
of
your
country
like
your
friend
the
convict
here
do
talk
such
rot
man
in
the
first
place
he
is
a
convict
you
know
that
well
enough
he
is
just
out
of
prison
at
any
rate
however
this
sort
of
thing
is
my
line
of
country
at
all
so
the
next
time
you
want
to
do
a
bit
of
gaol
delivery
on
your
own
hook
do
ask
me
to
help
you
well
if
i
had
known
all
that
was
going
to
happen
i
have
asked
you
to
come
old
fellow
come
give
us
another
glass
of
your
and
no
more
of
your
sermon
which
edifying
the
lieutenant
filled
the
glass
which
tom
held
out
with
the
creaming
mixture
which
he
was
nursing
in
the
tin
but
he
was
not
prepared
to
waive
his
right
to
lecture
and
so
continued
while
tom
sipped
his
liquor
with
much
relish
and
looked
comically
across
at
his
old
schoolfellow
some
fellows
have
a
call
to
set
the
world
right
i
have
my
gracious
sovereign
pays
me
seven
and
sixpence
a
day
for
which
sum
i
undertake
to
be
shot
at
on
certain
occasions
and
by
proper
persons
and
i
hope
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
take
it
as
well
as
another
but
that
does
include
turning
out
to
be
potted
at
like
a
woodcock
on
your
confounded
berkshire
wilds
by
a
yeoman
it
is
to
be
done
at
the
figure
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
i
mean
just
what
i
say
that
one
of
those
unspeakable
yeomanry
has
been
shooting
at
you
just
so
no
you
do
really
mean
it
then
that
shot
we
heard
was
fired
at
you
my
honor
i
very
sorry
much
good
your
sorrow
would
have
done
me
if
your
precious
countryman
had
held
straight
well
what
can
i
say
more
east
if
there
anything
i
can
do
to
show
you
that
i
really
am
very
sorry
and
ashamed
at
having
brought
you
into
such
a
scrape
only
tell
me
what
it
is
i
do
suppose
your
word
would
go
for
much
at
the
horse
guards
or
i
ask
you
to
give
me
a
character
for
coolness
under
fire
come
i
see
you
joking
now
old
fellow
do
tell
us
how
it
happened
well
when
you
turned
off
across
the
common
i
pulled
up
for
half
a
minute
and
then
held
on
at
a
steady
slow
trot
if
i
had
pushed
on
ahead
my
friend
behind
would
have
been
just
as
likely
to
turn
after
you
as
after
me
presently
i
heard
number
one
coming
tearing
along
behind
and
as
soon
as
he
got
from
between
the
banks
he
saw
me
and
came
straight
after
me
down
the
road
you
were
well
away
to
the
left
so
now
i
just
clapped
on
a
bit
to
lead
him
further
away
from
the
right
scent
and
on
he
came
whooping
and
hallooing
to
me
to
pull
up
i
did
see
why
i
had
just
as
good
a
right
to
ride
along
the
road
at
my
own
pace
as
he
so
the
more
he
shouted
the
more
i
did
stop
but
the
beggar
had
the
legs
of
me
he
was
mounted
on
something
deuced
like
a
thoroughbred
and
gained
on
me
hand
over
hand
at
last
when
i
judged
he
must
be
about
twenty
yards
behind
i
thought
i
might
as
well
have
a
look
at
him
so
i
just
turned
for
a
moment
when
by
jove
there
was
my
lord
lugging
a
pistol
out
of
his
right
holster
he
shouted
again
to
me
to
stop
i
turned
ducked
my
head
and
the
next
moment
he
pulled
trigger
and
missed
me
and
what
happened
then
said
tom
eagerly
drawing
a
long
breath
why
i
flatter
myself
i
showed
considerable
generalship
if
i
had
given
him
time
to
get
at
his
other
pistol
or
his
toasting
fork
it
was
all
up
i
dived
into
my
pocket
where
by
good
luck
there
was
some
loose
powder
and
copper
caps
and
a
upset
the
snuff
grabbed
a
handful
of
the
mixture
and
pulled
hard
at
my
horse
next
moment
he
was
by
my
side
lifting
his
pistol
to
knock
me
over
so
i
gave
him
the
mixture
right
in
the
face
and
let
him
go
by
up
went
both
his
hands
and
away
went
he
and
his
horse
somewhere
over
the
common
out
of
sight
i
just
turned
round
and
walked
quietly
back
i
did
see
the
fun
of
accepting
any
more
attacks
in
the
rear
then
up
rides
number
two
a
young
farmer
on
a
big
gray
horse
blowing
like
a
grampus
he
pulled
up
short
when
we
met
and
stared
and
i
walked
past
him
you
never
saw
a
fellow
look
more
puzzled
i
had
regularly
him
however
he
took
heart
and
shouted
i
met
the
captain
i
said
gentleman
had
ridden
by
on
a
bright
bay
was
he
which
way
had
he
gone
so
i
pointed
generally
over
the
common
and
number
two
departed
and
then
down
came
the
storm
and
i
turned
again
and
came
on
here
the
captain
it
must
have
been
wurley
then
who
fired
at
you
i
do
know
who
it
was
i
only
hope
he
wo
be
blinded
it
a
strange
business
altogether
said
tom
looking
into
the
fire
i
scarcely
know
what
to
think
of
it
we
should
never
have
pulled
through
but
for
you
that
certain
i
know
what
to
think
of
it
well
enough
said
east
but
now
let
hear
what
happened
to
you
they
did
catch
you
of
course
no
but
it
was
touch
and
go
i
thought
it
was
all
up
at
one
time
for
harry
would
turn
right
across
their
line
but
he
knew
what
he
was
about
there
was
a
bog
between
us
and
they
came
on
right
into
it
and
we
left
them
floundering
the
convict
seems
to
have
his
head
about
him
then
where
is
he
by
the
way
i
curious
to
have
a
look
at
him
looking
after
the
horses
i
call
him
in
he
ought
have
something
to
drink
tom
went
to
the
door
and
called
harry
who
came
out
from
the
rough
shed
which
served
as
a
stable
in
his
shirt
with
a
wisp
of
hay
in
his
hand
he
had
stripped
off
coat
and
waistcoat
and
braces
and
had
been
warming
himself
by
giving
the
horses
a
good
dressing
why
harry
you
have
had
anything
said
tom
come
across
and
have
a
glass
of
something
hot
harry
followed
into
the
kitchen
and
stood
by
the
end
of
the
screen
looking
rather
uncomfortable
while
tom
poured
him
out
a
glass
of
the
hot
mixture
and
the
lieutenant
looked
him
over
with
keen
eyes
there
take
that
off
how
are
the
horses
pretty
fresh
master
tom
but
they
be
the
better
of
a
bran
mash
or
somethin
cumfable
i
spoke
to
the
missus
about
it
and
is
ready
to
put
on
the
fire
that
right
then
let
them
have
it
as
quick
as
you
can
then
i
med
fetch
it
and
warm
it
up
here
sir
said
harry
to
be
sure
the
sooner
the
better
harry
took
off
his
glass
making
a
shy
sort
of
duck
with
his
head
accompanied
by
your
health
sir
to
each
of
his
entertainers
and
then
disappeared
into
the
back
kitchen
returned
with
the
mash
which
he
put
on
the
fire
and
went
off
to
the
stable
again
what
do
you
think
of
him
said
tom
i
like
to
see
a
fellow
let
his
braces
down
when
he
goes
to
work
said
east
it
not
every
fellow
who
would
be
strapping
away
at
those
horses
instead
of
making
himself
at
home
in
the
back
kitchen
no
it
is
said
east
do
you
like
his
looks
now
he
not
a
bad
sort
your
convict
i
say
i
wish
you
would
call
him
names
very
good
your
unfortunate
friend
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
that
just
what
i
been
puzzling
about
all
the
way
here
what
do
you
think
and
then
they
drew
to
the
fire
again
and
began
to
talk
over
harry
prospects
in
some
ten
minutes
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
for
the
mash
and
this
time
drew
a
complimentary
remark
from
the
lieutenant
harry
was
passionately
fond
of
animals
and
especially
of
horses
and
they
found
it
out
quickly
enough
as
they
always
do
the
two
hacks
were
by
this
time
almost
fresh
again
with
dry
coats
and
feet
well
washed
and
cleansed
and
while
working
at
them
harry
had
been
thinking
over
all
he
had
heard
that
evening
and
what
with
the
work
and
what
with
his
thoughts
found
himself
getting
more
hopeful
every
minute
no
one
who
had
seen
his
face
an
hour
before
on
the
heath
would
have
believed
it
was
the
same
man
who
was
now
patting
and
fondling
the
two
hacks
as
they
disposed
of
the
mash
he
had
prepared
for
them
he
leant
back
against
the
manger
rubbing
the
ears
of
tom
hack
the
one
which
had
carried
double
so
well
in
their
first
flight
gently
with
his
two
hands
while
the
delighted
beast
bent
down
its
head
and
pressed
it
against
him
and
stretched
its
neck
expressing
in
all
manner
of
silent
ways
its
equine
astonishment
and
satisfaction
by
the
light
of
the
single
dip
harry
face
grew
shorter
and
shorter
until
at
last
a
quiet
humorous
look
began
to
creep
back
into
it
as
we
have
already
taken
the
liberty
of
putting
the
thoughts
of
his
betters
into
words
we
must
now
do
so
for
him
and
if
he
had
expressed
his
thoughts
in
his
own
vernacular
as
he
rubbed
the
hack
ears
in
the
stable
his
speech
would
have
been
much
as
follows
how
cums
it
as
i
be
all
changed
like
as
tho
sum
un
had
tuk
and
rubbed
all
the
downheartedness
out
o
me
here
i
be
two
days
out
o
gaol
wi
nothin
in
the
world
but
the
things
i
stands
in
for
in
course
i
med
just
give
up
the
bits
o
things
as

and
they
all
draggled
wi
the
wet
and
i
med
be
tuk
in
the
mornin
and
sent
across
the
water
and
yet
i
feels
sum
how
as
peert
as
a
yukkel
so
fur
as
i
can
see
is
jest
nothin
but
talkin
wi
our
master
tom
what
a
fine
thing
to
be
a
schollard
and
yet
is
nothin
but
talk
arter
all
said
and
done
but
is
allus
the
same
whenever
i
gets
talkin
wi
he
it
all
cums
out
as
smooth
as
crame
fust
time
as
ever
i
seen
him
since
we
wur
bwys
he
talked
just
as
a
do
now
and
then
my
poor
mother
died
then
he
come
in
arter
the
funeral
and
talked
me
up
agen
till
i
thought
as

if

un
and
talks
wi

if
i
be
gwine
to
be
hung
is
a
wunnerful
thing
to
be
a
schollard
to
be
able
to
make
things
look
all
straight
when
they
be
ever
so
akkerd
and
unked
and
then
harry
left
off
rubbing
the
horse
ears
and
pulling
the
damp
piece
of
paper
which
tom
had
given
him
out
of
his
breeches
pocket
proceeded
to
flatten
it
out
tenderly
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
read
it
by
the
light
of
the
dip
when
the
landlady
came
to
inform
him
that
the
gentlefolk
wanted
him
in
the
kitchen
so
he
folded
his
treasure
up
again
and
went
off
to
the
kitchen
he
found
tom
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
while
the
lieutenant
was
sitting
at
the
table
writing
on
a
scrap
of
paper
which
the
landlady
had
produced
after
much
hunting
over
of
drawers
tom
began
with
some
little
hesitation
oh
harry
i
been
talking
matters
over
with
my
friend
here
and
i
changed
my
mind
it
wo
do
after
all
for
you
to
stay
about
at
railway
work
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
see
you
would
be
safe
they
be
sure
to
trace
you
and
you
get
into
trouble
about
this
day
work
and
then
after
all
it
a
very
poor
opening
for
a
young
fellow
like
you
now
why
should
you
enlist
into
east
regiment
you
be
in
his
company
and
it
a
splendid
profession
what
do
you
say
now
east
looked
up
at
poor
harry
who
was
quite
taken
aback
at
this
change
in
his
prospects
and
could
only
mutter
that
he
had
never
turned
his
mind
to
sodgerin
it
just
the
thing
for
you
tom
went
on
you
can
write
and
keep
accounts
and
you
get
on
famously
ask
east
if
you
wo
and
do
you
fear
about
matters
at
home
you
see
that
all
come
right
i
pledge
you
my
word
it
will
and
take
care
that
you
shall
hear
everything
that
goes
on
there
and
depend
upon
it
it
your
best
chance
you
be
back
at
englebourn
as
a
sergeant
in
no
time
and
be
able
to
snap
your
fingers
at
them
all
you
come
with
us
to
steventon
station
and
take
the
night
train
to
london
and
then
in
the
morning
go
to
whitehall
and
find
east
sergeant
he
give
you
a
note
to
him
and
they
send
you
on
to
chatham
where
the
regiment
is
you
think
it
the
best
thing
for
him
do
you
said
tom
turning
to
east
yes
i
think
you
do
very
well
if
you
only
keep
steady
a
note
to
the
sergeant
and
i
shall
be
back
at
chatham
in
a
day
or
two
myself
harry
took
the
note
mechanically
he
was
quite
unable
yet
to
make
any
resistance
and
now
get
something
to
eat
as
quick
as
you
can
for
we
ought
to
be
off
the
horses
are
all
right
i
suppose
yes
master
tom
said
harry
with
an
appealing
look
where
are
your
coat
and
waistcoat
harry
they
be
in
the
stable
sir
in
the
stable
why
they
all
wet
then
still
oh
is
no
odds
about
that
master
tom
no
odds
get
them
in
directly
and
put
them
to
dry
here
so
harry
winburn
went
off
to
the
stable
to
fetch
his
clothes
he
a
fine
fellow
said
east
getting
up
and
coming
to
the
fire
i
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
him
but
he
does
fancy
enlisting
poor
fellow
he
has
to
leave
his
sweetheart
it
a
sad
business
but
it
the
best
thing
for
him
and
you
see
go
tom
was
right
poor
harry
came
in
and
dried
his
clothes
and
got
his
supper
and
while
he
was
eating
it
and
all
along
the
road
afterwards
till
they
reached
the
station
at
about
eleven
pleaded
in
his
plain
way
with
tom
against
leaving
his
own
country
side
and
east
listened
silently
and
liked
him
better
and
better
tom
argued
with
him
gently
and
turned
the
matter
round
on
all
sides
putting
the
most
hopeful
face
upon
it
and
in
the
end
talked
first
himself
and
then
harry
into
the
belief
that
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
him
and
more
likely
than
any
other
course
of
action
to
bring
everything
right
between
him
and
all
the
folk
at
englebourn
so
they
got
into
the
train
at
steventon
in
pretty
good
heart
with
his
fare
paid
and
in
his
pocket
more
and
more
impressed
in
his
mind
with
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
was
to
be
a
schollard
the
two
friends
rode
back
to
oxford
at
a
good
pace
they
had
both
of
them
quite
enough
to
think
about
and
were
not
in
the
humour
for
talk
had
place
and
time
served
so
that
scarce
a
word
passed
between
them
till
they
had
left
their
horses
at
the
livery
stables
and
were
walking
through
the
silent
streets
a
few
minutes
before
midnight
then
east
broke
silence
i
ca
make
out
how
you
do
it
i
give
pay
to
get
the
way
of
it
the
way
of
what
what
an
you
talking
about
why
your
way
of
shutting
your
eyes
and
going
in
blind
well
that
a
queer
wish
for
a
fighting
man
said
tom
laughing
we
always
thought
a
rusher
no
good
at
school
and
that
the
thing
to
learn
was
to
go
in
with
your
own
eyes
open
and
shut
up
other
people
ah
but
we
had
cut
our
then
i
look
at
these
things
from
a
professional
point
of
view
my
business
is
to
get
fellows
to
shut
their
eyes
tight
and
i
begin
to
think
you
ca
do
it
as
it
should
be
done
without
shutting
your
own
first
i
do
take
why
look
at
the
way
you
talked
your
convict
i
beg
your
pardon
your
unfortunate
friend
into
enlisting
tonight
you
talked
as
if
you
believed
every
word
you
were
saying
to
him
so
i
did
well
i
should
like
to
have
you
for
a
recruiting
sergeant
if
you
could
only
drop
that
radical
bosh
if
i
had
had
to
do
it
instead
of
enlisting
he
would
have
gone
straight
off
and
hung
himself
in
the
stable
i
glad
you
did
try
your
hand
at
it
then
look
again
at
me
do
you
think
anyone
but
such
a
well
i
want
to
say
anything
uncivil
a
headlong
dog
like
you
could
have
got
me
into
such
a
business
as
now
i
want
to
be
able
to
get
other
fellows
to
make
just
such
fools
of
themselves
as
made
of
myself
how
do
you
do
it
i
do
know
unless
it
is
that
i
ca
help
always
looking
at
the
best
side
of
things
myself
and
so
most
things
have
got
a
best
side
well
at
the
pretty
good
side
then
nor
a
pretty
good
one
if
they
have
got
a
pretty
good
one
it
do
matter
how
you
look
at
them
i
should
think
no
i
do
believe
it
does
much
still
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
too
when
i
want
with
the
view
of
getting
others
to
do
ditto
of
course
i
wish
i
could
help
you
old
fellow
but
i
do
see
my
way
to
it
i
shall
talk
to
our
regimental
doctor
about
it
and
get
put
through
a
course
of
before
we
start
for
india
they
call
it
what
fools
are
fed
on
but
it
odd
that
you
should
have
broken
out
in
this
place
when
all
the
way
home
i
been
doing
nothing
but
envying
you
your
special
talent
what
that
just
the
opposite
one
the
art
of
falling
on
your
feet
i
should
like
to
exchange
with
you
you
make
a
precious
bad
bargain
of
it
then
there
twelve
striking
i
must
knock
in
good
night
you
be
round
to
breakfast
at
nine
all
right
i
believe
in
your
breakfasts
rather
said
east
as
they
shook
hands
at
the
gate
of
ambrose
into
which
tom
disappeared
while
the
lieutenant
strolled
back
to
the
mitre
chapter
xlii
third
year
east
returned
to
his
regiment
in
a
few
days
and
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
gallant
embarked
for
india
tom
wrote
several
letters
to
the
lieutenant
inclosing
notes
to
harry
with
gleanings
of
news
from
englebourn
where
his
escape
on
the
night
of
the
riot
had
been
a
wonder
and
now
that
he
was
fairly
and
out
of
the
way
public
opinion
was
beginning
to
turn
in
his
favor
in
due
course
a
letter
arrived
from
the
lieutenant
dated
cape
town
giving
a
prosperous
account
of
the
voyage
so
far
east
did
not
say
much
about
your
convict
as
he
still
insisted
on
calling
harry
but
the
little
he
did
say
was
very
satisfactory
and
tom
sent
off
this
part
of
the
letter
to
katie
to
whom
he
had
confided
the
whole
story
entreating
her
to
make
the
best
use
of
it
in
the
interest
of
the
young
soldier
and
after
this
beginning
he
settled
down
into
the
usual
routine
of
his
oxford
life
this
change
in
his
opinions
and
objects
of
interest
brought
him
now
into
more
intimate
relations
with
a
set
of
whom
he
had
as
yet
seen
little
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
may
call
them
the
party
of
progress
at
their
parties
instead
of
practical
jokes
and
boisterous
mirth
and
talk
of
boats
and
bats
and
guns
and
horses
the
highest
and
deepest
questions
of
morals
and
politics
and
metaphysics
were
discussed
and
discussed
with
freshness
and
enthusiasm
which
is
apt
to
wear
off
when
doing
has
to
take
the
place
of
talking
but
has
a
strange
charm
of
its
own
while
it
lasts
and
is
looked
back
to
with
loving
regret
by
those
for
whom
it
is
no
longer
a
possibility
with
this
set
tom
soon
fraternized
and
drank
in
many
new
ideas
and
took
to
himself
also
many
new
crotchets
besides
those
with
which
he
was
already
weighted
almost
all
his
new
acquaintances
were
liberal
in
politics
but
a
few
only
were
ready
to
go
all
lengths
with
him
they
were
all
union
men
and
tom
of
course
followed
the
fashion
and
soon
propounded
theories
in
that
institution
which
gained
him
the
name
of
chartist
brown
there
was
a
strong
mixture
of
in
it
all
he
had
a
kind
of
idea
that
he
had
discovered
something
which
it
was
creditable
to
have
discovered
and
that
it
was
a
very
fine
thing
to
have
all
these
feelings
for
and
sympathies
with
the
masses
and
to
believe
in
democracy
and
glorious
humanity
and
a
good
time
coming
and
i
know
not
what
other
big
matters
and
although
it
startled
and
pained
him
at
first
to
hear
himself
called
ugly
names
which
he
had
hated
and
despised
from
his
youth
up
and
to
know
that
many
of
his
old
acquaintances
looked
upon
him
not
simply
as
a
madman
but
as
a
madman
with
snobbish
proclivities
yet
when
the
first
plunge
was
over
there
was
a
good
deal
on
the
other
hand
which
tickled
his
vanity
and
was
far
from
being
unpleasant
to
do
him
justice
however
the
disagreeables
were
such
that
had
there
not
been
some
genuine
belief
at
the
bottom
he
would
certainly
have
been
headed
back
very
speedily
into
the
fold
of
political
and
social
orthodoxy
as
it
was
amidst
the
cloud
of
sophisms
and
platitudes
and
big
ideas
which
filled
his
thoughts
and
overflowed
in
his
talk
there
was
growing
in
him
and
taking
firmer
hold
on
him
daily
a
true
and
broad
sympathy
for
men
as
men
and
especially
for
poor
men
as
poor
men
and
a
righteous
and
burning
hatred
against
all
laws
customs
or
notions
which
according
to
his
light
either
were
or
seemed
to
be
setting
aside
or
putting
anything
else
in
the
place
of
or
above
the
man
it
was
with
him
the
natural
outgrowth
of
the
child
and
boy
training
though
his
father
would
have
been
much
astonished
to
be
told
so
and
the
instincts
of
those
early
days
were
now
getting
rapidly
set
into
habits
and
faiths
and
becoming
a
part
of
himself
in
this
stage
of
his
life
as
in
so
many
former
ones
tom
got
great
help
from
his
intercourse
with
hardy
now
the
rising
tutor
of
the
college
hardy
was
travelling
much
the
same
road
himself
as
our
hero
but
was
somewhat
further
on
and
had
come
into
it
from
a
different
country
and
though
quite
other
obstacles
their
early
lives
had
been
very
different
and
both
by
nature
and
from
long
and
severe
and
discipline
hardy
was
much
the
less
impetuous
and
demonstrative
of
the
two
he
did
not
rush
out
therefore
as
tom
was
too
much
inclined
to
do
the
moment
he
had
seized
hold
of
the
end
of
a
new
idea
which
he
felt
to
be
good
for
and
what
wanted
and
brandish
it
in
the
face
of
all
comers
and
think
himself
a
traitor
to
the
truth
if
he
trying
to
make
everybody
he
met
with
eat
it
hardy
on
the
contrary
would
test
his
new
idea
and
turn
it
over
and
prove
it
as
far
as
he
could
and
try
to
get
hold
of
the
whole
of
it
and
ruthlessly
strip
off
any
tinsel
or
sentiment
with
which
it
might
happen
to
be
mixed
up
often
and
often
did
tom
suffer
under
this
severe
method
and
rebel
against
it
and
accuse
his
friend
both
to
his
face
and
in
his
own
secret
thoughts
of
coldness
and
want
of
faith
and
all
manner
of
other
sins
of
omission
and
commission
in
the
end
however
he
generally
came
round
with
more
or
less
of
rebellion
according
to
the
severity
of
the
treatment
and
acknowledge
that
when
hardy
brought
him
down
from
riding
the
high
horse
it
was
not
without
good
reason
and
that
the
dust
in
which
he
was
rolled
was
always
most
wholesome
dust
for
instance
there
was
no
phrase
more
frequently
in
the
mouths
of
the
party
of
progress
than
the
good
cause
it
was
a
fine
phrase
which
could
be
used
with
great
effect
in
perorations
of
speeches
at
the
union
and
was
sufficiently
indefinite
to
be
easily
defended
from
ordinary
attacks
while
it
saved
him
who
used
it
the
trouble
of
ascertaining
accurately
for
himself
or
settling
for
his
hearers
what
it
really
did
mean
but
however
satisfactory
it
might
be
before
promiscuous
audiences
and
so
long
as
vehement
assertion
or
declaration
was
all
that
was
required
to
uphold
it
this
same
good
cause
was
liable
to
come
to
much
grief
when
it
had
to
get
itself
defined
hardy
was
particularly
given
to
persecution
on
this
subject
when
he
could
get
tom
and
perhaps
one
or
two
others
in
a
quiet
room
by
themselves
while
professing
the
utmost
sympathy
for
the
good
cause
and
a
hope
as
strong
as
theirs
that
all
its
enemies
might
find
themselves
suspended
to
as
soon
as
possible
he
would
pursue
it
into
corners
from
which
escape
was
most
difficult
asking
it
and
its
supporters
what
it
exactly
was
and
driving
them
from
one
to
another
and
from
the
good
cause
to
the
people
cause
the
cause
of
labor
and
other
like
troublesome
definitions
until
the
great
idea
seemed
to
have
no
shape
or
existence
any
longer
even
in
their
own
brains
but
hardy
persecution
provoking
as
it
was
for
the
time
never
went
to
the
undermining
of
any
real
conviction
in
the
minds
of
his
juniors
or
the
shaking
of
anything
which
did
not
need
shaking
but
only
helped
them
to
clear
their
ideas
and
brains
as
to
what
they
were
talking
and
thinking
about
and
gave
them
glimpses
soon
clouded
over
again
but
most
useful
nevertheless
of
the
truth
that
there
were
a
good
many
knotty
questions
to
be
solved
before
a
man
could
be
quite
sure
that
he
had
found
out
the
way
to
set
the
world
thoroughly
to
rights
and
heal
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
hardy
treated
another
of
his
friend
most
favorite
notions
even
with
less
respect
than
this
one
of
the
good
cause
democracy
that
universal
democracy
which
their
favourite
author
had
recently
declared
to
be
an
inevitable
fact
of
the
days
in
which
we
live
was
perhaps
on
the
whole
the
pet
idea
of
the
small
section
of
liberal
young
oxford
with
whom
tom
was
now
hand
and
glove
they
lost
no
opportunity
of
worshipping
it
and
doing
battle
for
it
and
indeed
most
of
them
did
very
truly
believe
that
that
state
of
the
world
which
this
universal
democracy
was
to
bring
about
and
which
was
coming
no
man
could
say
how
soon
was
to
be
in
fact
that
age
of
peace
and
which
men
had
dreamt
of
in
all
times
when
the
lion
should
lie
down
with
the
kid
and
nation
should
not
vex
nation
any
more
after
hearing
something
to
this
effect
from
tom
on
several
occasions
hardy
cunningly
lured
him
to
his
rooms
on
the
pretence
of
talking
over
the
prospects
of
the
boat
club
and
then
having
seated
him
by
the
fire
which
he
himself
proceeded
to
assault
gently
with
the
poker
propounded
suddenly
to
him
the
question
brown
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
mean
by
tom
at
once
saw
the
trap
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
made
several
efforts
to
break
away
but
unsuccessfully
and
being
seated
to
a
cup
of
tea
and
allowed
to
smoke
was
then
and
there
grievously
oppressed
and
mangled
and
sat
upon
by
his
oldest
and
best
friend
he
took
his
ground
carefully
and
propounded
only
what
he
felt
sure
that
hardy
himself
would
at
once
accept
what
no
man
of
any
worth
could
possibly
take
exception
to
he
meant
much
more
he
said
than
this
but
for
the
present
purpose
it
would
be
enough
for
him
to
say
that
whatever
else
it
might
mean
democracy
in
his
mouth
always
meant
that
every
man
should
have
a
share
in
the
government
of
his
country
hardy
seeming
to
acquiesce
and
making
a
sudden
change
in
the
subject
of
their
talk
decoyed
his
innocent
guest
away
from
the
thought
of
democracy
for
a
few
minutes
by
holding
up
to
him
the
flag
of
in
which
worship
tom
was
of
course
a
sedulous
believer
then
having
involved
him
in
most
difficult
country
his
persecutor
opened
fire
upon
him
from
masked
batteries
of
the
most
deadly
kind
the
guns
being
all
from
the
armory
of
his
own
prophets
you
long
for
the
rule
of
the
ablest
man
everywhere
at
all
times
to
find
your
ablest
man
and
then
give
him
power
and
obey
him
that
you
hold
to
be
about
the
highest
act
of
wisdom
which
a
nation
can
be
capable
of
yes
and
you
know
you
believe
that
to
hardy
just
as
firmly
as
i
do
i
hope
so
but
then
how
about
our
universal
democracy
and
every
man
having
a
share
in
the
government
of
his
country
tom
felt
that
his
flank
was
turned
in
fact
the
contrast
of
his
two
beliefs
had
never
struck
him
vividly
before
and
he
was
consequently
much
confused
but
hardy
went
on
tapping
a
big
coal
gently
with
the
poker
and
gave
him
time
to
recover
himself
and
collect
his
thoughts
i
do
mean
of
course
that
every
man
is
to
have
an
actual
share
in
the
government
he
said
at
last
but
every
man
is
somehow
to
have
a
share
and
if
not
an
actual
one
i
ca
see
what
the
proposition
comes
to
i
call
it
having
a
share
in
the
government
when
a
man
has
share
in
saying
who
shall
govern
him
well
you
own
that
a
very
different
thing
but
let
see
will
that
find
our
wisest
governor
for
us
letting
all
the
most
foolish
men
in
the
nation
have
a
say
as
to
who
he
is
to
be
come
now
hardy
i
heard
you
say
that
you
are
for
manhood
suffrage
that
another
question
you
let
in
another
idea
there
at
present
we
are
considering
whether
the
is
the
best
test
for
finding
your
best
man
i
afraid
all
history
is
against
you
that
a
good
joke
now
there
i
defy
you
hardy
begin
at
the
beginning
then
and
let
us
see
i
suppose
you
say
then
that
the
egyptian
and
babylonian
empires
were
better
than
the
little
jewish
republic
republic
well
let
that
pass
but
i
never
heard
that
the
jews
elected
moses
or
any
of
the
judges
well
never
mind
the
jews
they
an
exceptional
case
you
ca
argue
from
them
i
do
admit
that
i
believe
just
the
contrary
but
go
on
well
then
what
do
you
say
to
the
glorious
greek
republics
with
athens
at
the
head
of
them
i
say
that
no
nation
ever
treated
their
best
men
so
badly
i
see
i
must
put
on
a
lecture
in
aristophanes
for
your
special
benefit
vain
irritable
shallow
suspicious
old
demus
with
his
two
oboli
in
his
cheek
and
doubting
only
between
cleon
and
the
which
he
shall
choose
for
his
wisest
man
not
to
govern
but
to
serve
his
whims
and
caprices
you
must
call
another
witness
i
think
but
that
a
caricature
take
the
picture
then
out
of
thucydides
plato
xenophon
how
you
will
you
wo
mend
the
matter
much
you
should
go
so
fast
brown
you
wo
mind
my
saying
so
i
know
you
do
get
clear
in
your
own
mind
before
you
pitch
into
everyone
who
comes
across
you
and
so
do
your
own
side
which
i
admit
is
mostly
the
right
one
more
harm
than
good
tom
could
stand
being
put
down
so
summarily
and
fought
over
the
ground
from
one
country
to
another
from
rome
to
the
united
states
with
all
the
arguments
he
could
muster
but
with
little
success
that
unfortunate
first
admission
of
his
he
felt
it
throughout
like
a
millstone
round
his
neck
and
could
not
help
admitting
to
himself
when
he
left
that
there
was
a
good
deal
in
hardy
concluding
remark
you
find
it
rather
a
tough
business
to
get
your
democracy
and
by
the
wisest
to
pull
together
in
one
coach
notwithstanding
all
such
occasional
reverses
and
cold
baths
however
tom
went
on
strengthening
himself
in
his
new
opinions
and
maintaining
them
with
all
the
zeal
of
a
convert
the
shelves
of
his
bookcase
and
the
walls
of
his
room
soon
began
to
show
signs
of
the
change
which
was
taking
place
in
his
ways
of
looking
at
men
and
things
hitherto
a
framed
engraving
of
george
iii
had
hung
over
his
but
early
in
this
his
third
year
the
frame
had
disappeared
for
a
few
days
and
when
it
reappeared
the
solemn
face
of
john
milton
looked
out
from
it
while
the
honest
monarch
had
retired
into
a
portfolio
a
facsimile
of
magna
charta
soon
displaced
a
large
colored
print
of
a
day
with
the
pycheley
and
soon
afterwards
the
death
warrant
of
charles
with
its
grim
and
resolute
rows
of
signatures
and
seals
appeared
on
the
wall
in
a
place
of
honour
in
the
neighbourhood
of
milton
squire
brown
was
passing
through
oxford
and
paid
his
son
a
visit
soon
after
this
last
arrangement
had
been
completed
he
dined
in
hall
at
the
high
table
being
still
a
member
of
the
college
and
afterwards
came
with
hardy
to
tom
rooms
to
have
a
quiet
glass
of
wine
and
spend
the
evening
with
his
son
and
a
few
of
his
friends
who
had
been
asked
to
meet
the
governor
tom
had
a
struggle
with
himself
whether
he
should
not
remove
the
into
his
bedroom
for
the
evening
and
had
actually
taken
if
down
with
this
view
but
in
the
end
he
could
not
stomach
such
a
backsliding
and
so
restored
it
to
its
place
i
have
never
concealed
my
opinions
from
my
father
he
thought
though
i
do
think
he
quite
knows
what
they
are
but
if
he
does
he
ought
and
the
sooner
the
better
i
should
be
a
sneak
to
try
to
hide
them
i
know
he
wo
like
it
but
he
is
always
just
and
fair
and
will
make
allowances
at
any
rate
up
it
goes
again
and
so
he
the
but
with
the
devout
secret
hope
that
his
father
might
not
see
it
the
went
off
admirably
the
men
were
nice
gentlemanly
intelligent
fellows
and
the
squire
who
had
been
carefully
planted
by
tom
with
his
back
to
the
enjoyed
himself
very
much
at
last
they
all
went
except
hardy
and
now
the
nervous
time
approached
for
a
short
time
longer
the
three
sat
at
the
while
the
squire
enlarged
upon
the
great
improvement
in
young
men
and
the
habits
of
the
university
especially
in
the
matter
of
drinking
tom
had
only
opened
three
bottles
of
port
in
his
time
the
men
would
have
drunk
certainly
not
less
than
a
bottle
a
man
and
other
like
remarks
he
made
as
he
sipped
his
coffee
and
then
pushing
back
his
chair
said
well
tom
had
your
servant
better
clear
away
and
then
we
can
draw
round
the
fire
and
have
a
talk
would
you
like
to
take
a
turn
while
he
is
clearing
the
martyr
memorial
you
have
seen
no
thank
you
i
know
the
place
well
enough
i
do
come
to
walk
about
in
the
dark
we
be
in
your
man
way
and
so
tom
scout
came
in
to
clear
away
took
out
the
extra
leaves
of
the
table
put
on
the
cloth
and
laid
tea
during
these
operations
brown
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looking
about
him
as
he
talked
when
there
was
more
space
to
move
in
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
and
very
soon
took
to
remarking
the
furniture
and
arrangements
of
the
room
one
after
the
other
the
pictures
came
under
his
notice
most
of
them
escaped
without
comment
the
squire
simply
pausing
a
moment
and
then
taking
up
his
walk
again
magna
charta
drew
forth
his
hearty
approval
it
was
a
capital
notion
to
hang
such
things
on
his
walls
instead
of
bad
prints
of
or
trash
of
that
sort
ah
something
else
of
the
same
kind
why
tom
what
this
said
the
squire
as
he
paused
before
the
there
was
a
moment
or
two
of
dead
silence
while
the
squire
eyes
ran
down
the
names
from
jo
bradshaw
to
miles
corbet
and
then
he
turned
and
came
and
sat
down
opposite
to
his
son
tom
expected
his
father
to
be
vexed
but
was
not
the
least
prepared
for
the
tone
of
pain
and
sorrow
and
anger
in
which
he
first
inquired
and
then
remonstrated
for
some
time
past
the
squire
and
his
son
had
not
felt
so
comfortable
together
as
of
old
brown
had
been
annoyed
by
much
that
tom
had
done
in
the
case
of
harry
winburn
though
he
did
not
know
all
there
had
sprung
up
a
barrier
somehow
or
other
between
them
neither
of
them
knew
how
they
had
often
felt
embarrassed
at
being
left
alone
together
during
the
past
year
and
found
that
there
were
certain
topics
which
they
could
not
talk
upon
which
they
avoided
by
mutual
consent
every
now
and
then
the
constraint
and
embarrassment
fell
off
for
a
short
time
for
at
bottom
they
loved
and
appreciated
one
another
heartily
but
the
divergences
in
their
thoughts
and
habits
had
become
very
serious
and
seemed
likely
to
increase
rather
than
not
they
felt
keenly
the
chasm
between
the
two
generations
as
they
looked
at
one
another
from
opposite
banks
each
in
his
secret
heart
blamed
the
other
in
great
measure
for
that
which
was
the
fault
of
neither
mixed
with
the
longings
which
each
felt
for
a
better
understanding
was
enough
of
reserve
and
indignation
to
prevent
them
from
coming
to
it
the
discovery
of
their
differences
was
too
recent
and
they
were
too
much
alike
in
character
and
temper
for
either
to
make
large
enough
allowance
for
or
to
be
really
tolerant
of
the
other
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
they
had
come
to
outspoken
and
serious
difference
and
though
the
collision
had
been
exceedingly
painful
to
both
yet
when
they
parted
for
the
night
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
the
ice
had
been
thoroughly
broken
before
his
father
left
the
room
tom
had
torn
the
facsimile
of
the
out
of
its
frame
and
put
it
in
the
fire
protesting
however
at
the
same
time
that
though
he
did
thist
out
of
deference
to
his
father
and
was
deeply
grieved
at
having
given
him
pain
he
could
not
and
would
not
give
up
his
convictions
or
pretend
that
they
were
changed
or
even
shaken
the
squire
walked
back
to
his
hotel
deeply
moved
who
can
wonder
he
was
a
man
full
of
living
and
vehement
convictions
one
of
his
early
recollections
had
been
the
arrival
in
england
of
the
news
of
the
beheading
of
louis
xvi
and
the
doings
of
the
reign
of
terror
he
had
been
bred
in
the
times
when
it
was
held
impossible
for
a
gentleman
or
a
christian
to
hold
such
views
as
his
son
had
been
maintaining
and
like
many
of
the
noblest
englishmen
of
his
time
had
gone
with
and
accepted
the
creed
of
the
day
tom
remained
behind
dejected
and
melancholy
now
accusing
his
father
of
injustice
and
bigotry
now
longing
to
go
after
him
and
give
up
everything
what
were
all
his
opinions
and
convictions
compared
with
his
father
confidence
and
love
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
however
after
each
of
them
had
had
time
for
thinking
over
what
had
passed
they
met
with
a
cordiality
which
was
as
pleasant
to
each
as
it
was
unlooked
for
and
from
this
visit
of
his
father
to
him
at
oxford
tom
dated
a
new
and
more
satisfactory
epoch
in
their
intercourse
the
fact
had
begun
to
dawn
on
the
squire
that
the
world
had
changed
a
good
deal
since
his
time
he
saw
that
young
men
were
much
improved
in
some
ways
and
acknowledged
the
fact
heartily
on
the
other
hand
they
had
taken
up
with
a
lot
of
new
notions
which
he
could
not
understand
and
thought
mischievous
and
bad
perhaps
tom
might
get
over
them
as
he
got
to
be
older
and
wiser
and
in
the
meantime
he
must
take
the
evil
with
the
good
at
any
rate
he
was
too
fair
a
man
to
try
to
dragoon
his
son
out
of
anything
which
he
really
believed
tom
on
his
part
gratefully
accepted
the
change
in
his
father
manner
and
took
all
means
of
showing
his
gratitude
by
consulting
and
talking
freely
to
him
on
such
subjects
as
they
could
agree
upon
which
were
numerous
keeping
in
the
the
questions
which
had
provoked
painful
discussions
between
them
by
degrees
these
even
could
be
tenderly
approached
and
now
that
they
were
approached
in
a
different
spirit
the
honest
beliefs
of
the
father
and
son
no
longer
looked
so
monstrous
to
one
another
the
hard
and
sharp
outlines
began
to
wear
off
and
the
views
of
each
of
them
to
be
modified
thus
bit
by
bit
by
a
slow
but
sure
process
a
better
understanding
than
ever
was
between
them
this
beginning
of
a
better
state
of
things
in
his
relations
with
his
father
consoled
tom
for
many
other
matters
that
seemed
to
go
wrong
with
him
and
was
a
constant
bit
of
bright
sky
to
turn
to
when
the
rest
of
his
horizon
looked
dark
and
dreary
as
it
did
often
enough
for
it
proved
a
very
trying
year
to
him
this
his
third
and
last
year
at
the
university
a
year
full
of
large
dreams
and
small
performances
of
unfulfilled
hopes
and
struggles
to
set
himself
right
ending
ever
more
surely
in
failure
and
disappointment
the
common
pursuits
of
the
place
had
lost
their
freshness
and
with
it
much
of
their
charm
he
was
beginning
to
feel
himself
in
a
cage
and
to
beat
against
the
bars
of
it
often
in
spite
of
all
his
natural
hopefulness
his
heart
seemed
to
sicken
and
turn
cold
without
any
apparent
reason
his
old
pursuits
palled
on
him
and
he
scarcely
cared
to
turn
to
new
ones
what
was
it
that
made
life
so
blank
to
him
at
these
times
how
was
it
that
he
could
not
keep
the
spirit
within
him
alive
and
warm
it
was
easier
to
ask
such
questions
than
to
get
an
answer
was
it
not
this
place
he
was
living
in
and
the
ways
of
it
no
for
the
place
and
its
ways
were
the
same
as
ever
and
his
own
way
of
life
in
it
better
than
ever
before
was
it
the
want
of
sight
or
tidings
of
mary
sometimes
he
thought
so
and
then
cast
the
thought
away
as
treason
his
love
for
her
was
ever
sinking
deeper
into
him
and
raising
and
purifying
him
light
and
strength
and
life
came
from
that
source
craven
weariness
and
coldness
of
heart
come
from
whence
they
might
were
not
from
that
quarter
but
precious
as
his
love
was
to
him
and
deeply
as
it
affected
his
whole
life
he
felt
that
there
must
be
something
beyond
it
that
its
full
satisfaction
would
not
be
enough
for
him
the
bed
was
too
narrow
for
a
man
to
stretch
himself
on
what
he
was
in
search
of
must
underlie
and
embrace
his
human
love
and
support
it
beyond
and
above
all
private
and
personal
desires
and
hopes
and
longings
he
was
conscious
of
a
restless
craving
and
feeling
about
after
something
which
he
could
not
grasp
and
yet
which
was
not
avoiding
him
which
seemed
to
be
mysteriously
laying
hold
of
him
and
surrounding
him
the
routine
of
chapels
and
lectures
and
reading
for
degree
boating
cricketing
all
well
enough
in
their
way
left
this
vacuum
unfilled
there
was
a
great
outer
visible
world
the
problems
and
puzzles
of
which
were
rising
before
him
and
haunting
him
more
and
more
and
a
great
inner
and
invisible
world
opening
round
him
in
awful
depth
he
seemed
to
be
standing
on
the
brink
of
each
now
shivering
and
helpless
feeling
like
an
atom
about
to
be
whirled
into
the
great
flood
and
carried
he
knew
not
where
now
ready
to
plunge
in
and
take
his
part
full
of
hope
and
belief
that
he
was
meant
to
buffet
in
the
strength
of
a
man
with
the
seen
and
the
unseen
and
to
be
subdued
by
neither
in
such
a
year
as
this
a
bit
of
steady
bright
blue
sky
was
a
boon
beyond
all
price
and
so
he
felt
it
to
be
and
it
was
not
only
with
his
father
that
tom
regained
lost
ground
in
this
year
he
was
in
a
state
of
mind
in
which
he
could
not
bear
to
neglect
or
lose
any
particle
of
human
sympathy
and
so
he
turned
to
old
friendships
and
revived
the
correspondence
with
several
of
his
old
and
particularly
with
arthur
to
the
great
delight
of
the
latter
who
had
mourned
bitterly
over
the
few
lines
all
he
had
got
from
tom
of
late
in
answer
to
his
own
letters
which
had
themselves
under
the
weight
of
neglect
gradually
dwindled
down
to
mere
formal
matters
a
specimen
of
the
later
correspondence
may
fitly
close
the
chapter
ambrose
dear
geordie
i
can
hardly
pardon
you
for
having
gone
to
cambridge
though
you
have
got
a
trinity
scholarship
which
i
suppose
is
on
the
whole
quite
as
good
a
thing
as
anything
of
the
sort
you
could
have
got
up
here
i
had
so
looked
forward
to
having
you
here
though
and
now
i
feel
that
we
shall
probably
scarcely
ever
meet
you
will
go
your
way
and
i
mine
and
one
alters
so
quickly
and
gets
into
such
strange
new
grooves
that
unless
one
sees
a
man
about
once
a
week
at
least
you
may
be
just
like
strangers
when
you
are
thrown
together
again
if
you
had
come
up
here
it
would
have
been
all
right
and
we
should
have
gone
all
through
life
as
we
were
when
i
left
school
and
as
i
know
we
should
be
again
in
no
time
if
you
had
come
here
but
now
who
can
tell
what
makes
me
think
so
much
of
this
is
a
visit
of
a
few
days
that
east
paid
me
just
before
his
regiment
went
to
india
i
feel
that
if
he
had
done
it
and
we
had
not
met
till
he
came
back
years
hence
perhaps
we
should
never
have
been
to
one
another
what
we
shall
be
now
the
break
would
have
been
too
great
now
it
all
right
you
would
have
liked
to
see
the
old
fellow
grown
into
a
man
but
not
a
bit
altered
just
the
quiet
old
way
you
and
pretending
to
care
for
nothing
but
ready
to
cut
the
nose
off
his
face
or
go
through
fire
and
water
for
you
at
a
pinch
if
you
only
let
him
go
his
own
way
about
it
and
have
his
grumble
and
say
that
he
does
it
all
from
the
worst
possible
motives
but
we
must
try
not
to
lose
hold
of
one
another
geordie
it
would
be
a
bitter
day
to
me
if
i
thought
anything
of
the
kind
could
ever
happen
again
we
must
write
more
to
one
another
been
awfully
lazy
i
know
about
it
for
this
last
year
and
more
but
then
i
always
thought
you
would
be
coming
up
here
and
so
that
it
did
matter
much
but
now
i
will
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
write
to
you
about
my
secret
thoughts
my
works
and
ways
and
you
must
do
it
too
if
we
can
only
tide
over
the
next
year
or
two
we
shall
get
into
plain
sailing
and
i
suppose
it
will
all
right
then
at
least
i
ca
believe
that
one
is
likely
to
have
many
such
years
in
one
life
as
the
last
two
if
one
is
goodness
knows
where
i
shall
end
you
know
the
outline
of
what
has
happened
to
me
from
my
letters
and
the
talks
we
have
had
in
my
flying
visits
to
the
old
school
but
you
have
a
notion
of
the
troubles
of
mind
i
been
in
and
the
changes
i
gone
through
i
can
hardly
believe
it
myself
when
i
look
back
however
i
quite
sure
i
have
that
my
great
comfort
it
is
a
strange
blind
sort
of
world
that
a
fact
with
lots
of
blind
alleys
down
which
you
go
blundering
in
the
fog
after
some
seedy
gaslight
which
you
take
for
the
sun
till
you
run
against
the
wall
at
the
end
and
find
out
that
the
light
is
a
gaslight
and
that
there
no
thoroughfare
but
for
all
that
one
does
get
on
you
get
to
know
the
sun
light
better
and
better
and
to
keep
out
of
the
blind
alleys
and
i
am
surer
and
surer
every
day
that
there
always
sunlight
enough
for
every
honest
fellow
though
i
did
think
so
a
few
months
back
and
a
good
sound
road
under
his
feet
if
he
will
only
step
out
on
it
talking
of
blind
alleys
puts
me
in
mind
of
your
last
are
you
going
down
a
blind
alley
or
something
worse
there
no
wall
to
bring
you
up
that
i
can
see
down
the
turn
you
taken
and
then
what
the
practical
use
of
it
all
what
good
would
you
do
to
yourself
or
anyone
else
if
you
could
get
to
the
end
of
it
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
fancy
i
confess
what
you
think
will
come
of
speculating
about
necessity
and
free
will
i
only
know
that
i
can
hold
out
my
hand
before
me
and
can
move
it
to
the
right
or
left
despite
of
all
the
powers
in
heaven
or
earth
as
i
sit
here
writing
to
you
i
can
let
into
my
heart
and
give
the
reins
to
all
sorts
of
devil
passions
or
to
the
spirit
of
god
well
that
enough
for
me
i
it
of
myself
and
i
believe
you
know
it
of
yourself
and
everybody
knows
it
of
themselves
or
himself
and
why
you
ca
be
satisfied
with
that
passes
my
comprehension
as
if
one
has
got
puzzles
enough
and
bothers
enough
under
one
nose
without
going
after
a
lot
of
metaphysical
quibbles
no
i
wrong
not
going
anything
one
has
to
go
for
is
all
right
what
a
fellow
meets
outside
himself
he
is
responsible
for
and
must
do
the
best
he
can
with
but
to
go
on
for
ever
looking
inside
of
one
self
and
groping
about
amongst
one
own
sensations
and
ideas
and
whimsies
of
one
kind
and
another
i
ca
conceive
a
poorer
line
of
business
than
that
do
you
get
into
it
now
that
a
dear
boy
very
likely
you
tell
me
you
ca
help
it
that
every
one
has
his
own
difficulties
and
must
fight
them
out
and
that
mine
are
one
sort
and
yours
another
well
perhaps
you
may
be
right
i
hope
i
getting
to
know
that
my
plummet
is
to
measure
all
the
world
but
it
does
seem
a
pity
that
men
should
be
thinking
about
how
to
cure
some
of
the
wrongs
which
poor
dear
old
england
is
pretty
near
dying
of
instead
of
taking
the
edge
off
their
brains
and
spending
all
their
steam
in
speculating
about
all
kinds
of
things
which
would
make
any
poor
man
in
the
world
or
rich
one
either
for
that
matter
a
bit
better
off
if
they
were
all
found
out
and
settled
but
here
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
paper
do
be
angry
at
my
jobation
but
write
me
a
long
answer
of
your
own
free
will
and
believe
me
ever
affectionately

chapter
xliii
afternoon
visitors
miss
mary
porter
was
sitting
alone
in
the
front
of
her
father
house
in
belgravia
on
the
afternoon
of
a
day
in
this
same
year
two
years
and
more
have
passed
over
her
head
since
we
first
met
her
and
she
may
be
a
thought
more
sedate
and
better
dressed
but
there
is
no
other
change
to
be
noticed
in
her
the
room
was
for
the
most
part
much
like
other
rooms
in
that
quarter
of
the
world
there
were
few
luxuries
in
the
way
of
furniture
which
fallen
man
can
desire
which
were
not
to
be
found
there
but
over
and
above
this
there
was
an
elegance
in
the
arrangement
of
all
the
and
ornaments
and
an
appropriateness
and
good
taste
in
the
placing
of
every
piece
of
furniture
and
vase
of
flowers
which
showed
that
a
higher
order
of
mind
than
the
upholsterer
or
housemaid
was
constantly
overlooking
and
working
there
everything
seemed
to
be
in
its
exact
place
in
the
best
place
which
could
have
been
thought
of
for
it
and
to
be
the
best
thing
which
could
have
been
thought
of
for
the
place
and
yet
this
perfection
did
not
strike
you
particularly
at
first
or
surprise
you
in
any
way
but
sank
into
you
gradually
so
that
until
you
forced
yourself
to
consider
the
matter
you
could
not
in
the
least
say
why
the
room
had
such
a
very
pleasant
effect
on
you
the
young
lady
to
whom
this
charm
was
chiefly
owing
was
sitting
by
a
buhl
on
which
lay
her
embroidery
and
a
book
she
was
reading
a
letter
which
seemed
deeply
to
interest
her
for
she
did
not
hear
the
voice
of
the
butler
who
had
just
opened
the
door
and
disturbed
her
solitude
until
he
had
repeated
for
the
second
time
mr
smith
then
mary
jumped
up
and
hastily
folding
her
letter
put
it
into
her
pocket
she
was
rather
provoked
at
having
allowed
herself
to
be
caught
there
alone
by
afternoon
visitors
and
with
the
servants
for
having
let
anyone
in
nevertheless
she
welcomed
smith
with
a
cordiality
of
manner
which
perhaps
rather
more
than
represented
her
real
feelings
and
with
a
let
mamma
know
to
the
butler
set
to
work
to
entertain
her
visitor
she
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
doing
this
under
ordinary
circumstances
as
all
that
smith
wanted
was
a
good
listener
he
was
a
somewhat
heavy
and
garrulous
old
gentleman
with
many
imaginary
and
a
few
real
troubles
the
constant
contemplation
of
which
served
to
occupy
the
whole
of
his
own
time
and
as
much
of
his
friends
as
he
could
get
them
to
give
him
but
scarcely
had
he
settled
himself
comfortably
in
an
easy
chair
opposite
to
his
victim
when
the
butler
entered
again
and
announced
st
cloud
mary
was
now
no
longer
at
her
ease
her
manner
of
receiving
her
new
visitor
was
constrained
and
yet
it
was
clear
that
he
was
on
easy
terms
in
the
house
she
asked
the
butler
where
his
mistress
was
and
heard
with
vexation
that
she
had
gone
out
but
was
expected
home
almost
immediately
charging
him
to
let
her
mother
know
the
moment
she
returned
mary
turned
to
her
unwelcome
task
and
sat
herself
down
again
with
such
resignation
as
she
was
capable
of
at
the
moment
the
conduct
of
her
visitors
was
by
no
means
calculated
to
restore
her
composure
or
make
her
comfortable
between
them
she
was
sure
that
they
knew
one
another
but
neither
of
then
would
speak
to
the
other
there
the
two
sat
on
each
resolutely
bent
on
tiring
the
other
out
the
elder
crooning
on
to
her
in
an
undertone
and
ignoring
the
younger
who
in
his
turn
put
on
an
air
of
serene
unconsciousness
of
the
presence
of
his
senior
and
gazed
about
the
room
and
watched
mary
making
occasional
remarks
to
her
as
if
no
one
else
were
present
on
and
on
they
sat
her
only
comfort
being
the
hope
that
neither
of
them
would
have
the
conscience
to
stay
on
after
the
departure
of
the
other
between
them
mary
was
driven
to
her
wits
end
and
looked
for
her
mother
or
for
some
new
visitor
to
come
to
her
help
as
wellington
looked
for
the
prussians
on
the
afternoon
of
june
at
length
youth
and
insolence
prevailed
and
smith
rose
to
go
mary
got
up
too
and
after
his
departure
remained
standing
in
hopes
that
her
other
visitor
would
take
the
hint
and
follow
the
good
example
but
st
cloud
had
not
the
least
intention
of
moving
really
your
is
quite
astonishing
miss
porter
he
said
leaning
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
following
the
pattern
of
one
of
the
flowers
on
the
carpet
with
his
cane
which
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
showing
his
delicately
gloved
hand
to
advantage
indeed
why
do
you
think
so
she
asked
taking
up
her
embroidery
and
pretending
to
begin
working
have
i
not
good
reason
after
sitting
this
and
seeing
you
enduring
old
smith
the
greatest
bore
in
london
i
believe
there
are
three
houses
where
the
servants
dare
let
him
in
it
would
be
as
much
as
their
places
are
worth
no
porter
could
hope
for
a
character
who
let
him
in
twice
in
the
season
poor
smith
said
mary
smiling
but
you
know
we
have
no
porter
and
she
suddenly
checked
herself
and
added
gravely
he
is
an
old
friend
and
papa
and
mamma
like
him
but
the
wearisomeness
of
his
grievances
those
three
sons
in
the
plungers
and
their
eternal
scrapes
how
you
could
manage
to
keep
a
civil
face
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
polite
patience
indeed
i
am
very
sorry
for
his
troubles
i
wonder
where
mamma
can
be
we
are
going
to
drive
shall
you
be
in
the
park
i
think
it
must
be
time
for
me
to
dress
i
hope
not
it
is
so
seldom
that
i
see
you
except
in
crowded
rooms
can
you
wonder
that
i
should
value
such
a
chance
as
this
were
you
at
the
new
opera
last
night
asked
mary
carefully
avoiding
his
eye
and
sticking
to
her
work
but
scarcely
able
to
conceal
her
nervousness
and
discomfort
yes
i
was
there
but
oh
do
tell
me
about
it
then
i
hear
it
was
a
great
success
another
time
we
can
talk
of
the
opera
anywhere
let
me
speak
now
of
something
else
you
must
have
seen
miss
porter
how
can
you
think
i
will
talk
of
anything
till
you
have
told
me
about
the
opera
interrupted
mary
rapidly
and
nervously
was
grisi
very
fine
the
chief
part
was
composed
for
her
was
it
not
and
dear
old
lablache
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
presently
if
you
will
let
me
in
five
minutes
time
i
only
ask
for
five
minutes
five
minutes
oh
no
not
five
seconds
i
must
hear
about
the
new
opera
before
i
will
listen
to
a
word
of
anything
else
indeed
miss
porter
you
must
pardon
me
for
disobeying
but
i
may
not
have
such
a
chance
as
this
again
for
months
with
which
prelude
he
drew
his
chair
towards
hers
and
mary
was
just
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
to
jump
up
and
run
right
out
of
the
room
when
the
door
opened
and
the
butler
walked
in
with
a
card
on
a
waiter
mary
had
never
felt
so
relieved
in
her
life
and
could
have
hugged
the
solemn
old
domestic
when
he
said
presenting
the
card
to
her
the
gentleman
asked
if
or
you
were
in
miss
and
told
me
to
bring
it
up
and
find
whether
you
would
see
him
on
particular
business
he
waiting
in
the
hall
oh
yes
i
know
of
course
yes
say
i
will
see
him
directly
i
mean
ask
him
to
come
up
now
shall
i
show
him
into
the
library
miss
no
no
in
here
do
you
understand
yes
miss
replied
the
butter
with
a
deprecatory
look
at
st
cloud
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
i
ca
help
it
in
answer
to
his
impatient
telegraphic
signals
st
cloud
had
been
very
liberal
to
the
porters
servants
mary
confidence
had
all
come
back
relief
was
at
hand
she
could
trust
herself
to
hold
st
cloud
at
bay
now
as
it
could
not
be
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
she
turned
to
him
the
nervousness
had
quite
gone
out
of
her
manner
and
she
spoke
in
her
old
tone
again
as
she
laid
her
embroidery
aside
how
lucky
that
you
should
be
here
look
i
think
you
must
be
acquainted
she
said
holding
out
the
card
which
the
butler
had
given
her
to
st
cloud
he
took
it
mechanically
and
looked
at
it
and
then
crushed
it
in
his
hand
and
was
going
to
speak
she
prevented
him
i
was
right
i
sure
you
do
know
him
i
did
see
the
name
he
said
almost
fiercely
the
name
on
the
card
which
i
gave
you
just
now
mr
grey
he
is
curate
in
one
of
the
poor
westminster
districts
you
must
remember
him
for
he
was
of
your
college
he
was
at
oxford
with
you
i
made
his
acquaintance
at
the
commemoration
he
will
be
so
glad
to
meet
an
old
friend
st
cloud
was
too
much
provoked
to
answer
and
the
next
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
butler
announced
grey
grey
came
into
the
room
timidly
carrying
his
head
a
little
down
as
usual
and
glancing
uncomfortably
about
in
a
manner
which
used
to
make
drysdale
say
that
he
always
looked
as
though
he
had
just
been
robbing
a
mary
went
forward
to
meet
him
holding
out
her
hand
cordially
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
she
said
how
kind
of
you
to
call
when
you
are
so
busy
mamma
will
be
here
directly
i
think
you
must
remember
st
cloud
mr
grey
st
cloud
patience
was
now
quite
gone
he
drew
himself
up
making
the
slightest
possible
inclination
towards
grey
and
then
without
taking
any
further
notice
of
him
turned
to
mary
with
a
look
which
he
meant
to
be
full
of
pitying
admiration
for
her
and
contempt
of
her
visitor
but
as
she
would
not
look
at
him
it
was
thrown
away
so
he
made
his
bow
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
angrily
debating
with
himself
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
whether
she
could
have
understood
him
he
was
so
fully
convinced
of
the
sacrifice
which
a
man
in
his
position
was
making
in
paying
serious
attention
to
a
girl
with
little
fortune
and
no
connexion
that
he
soon
consoled
himself
in
the
belief
that
her
embarrassment
only
arose
from
shyness
and
that
the
moment
he
could
explain
himself
she
would
be
his
obedient
and
grateful
servant
meantime
mary
sat
down
opposite
to
the
curate
and
listened
to
him
as
he
unfolded
his
errand
awkwardly
enough
an
execution
was
threatened
in
the
house
of
a
poor
struggling
widow
whom
porter
had
employed
to
do
needlework
occasionally
and
who
was
behind
with
her
rent
through
sickness
he
was
afraid
that
her
things
would
be
taken
and
sold
in
the
morning
unless
she
could
borrow
two
sovereigns
he
had
so
many
claims
on
him
that
he
could
not
lend
her
the
money
himself
and
so
had
come
out
to
see
what
he
could
do
amongst
those
who
knew
her
by
the
time
grey
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
his
story
mary
had
made
up
her
mind
not
without
a
little
struggle
to
sacrifice
the
greater
part
of
what
was
left
of
her
quarter
allowance
after
all
it
would
only
be
wearing
cleaned
gloves
instead
of
new
ones
and
giving
up
her
new
till
next
quarter
so
she
jumped
up
and
said
gaily
is
that
all
grey
i
have
the
money
and
i
will
lend
it
her
with
pleasure
i
will
fetch
it
directly
she
tripped
off
to
her
room
and
soon
came
back
with
the
money
and
just
then
the
butler
came
in
with
tea
and
mary
asked
grey
to
take
some
he
looked
tired
she
said
and
if
he
would
wait
a
little
time
he
would
see
her
mother
who
would
be
sure
to
do
something
more
for
the
poor
woman
grey
had
risen
to
leave
and
was
standing
hat
in
hand
ready
to
go
he
was
in
the
habit
of
reckoning
with
himself
strictly
for
every
minute
of
his
day
and
was
never
quite
satisfied
with
himself
unless
he
was
doing
the
most
disagreeable
thing
which
circumstances
for
the
time
being
allowed
him
to
do
but
greater
and
stronger
men
than
grey
from
adam
downwards
have
yielded
to
the
temptation
before
which
he
now
succumbed
he
looked
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
there
was
something
so
fresh
and
bright
in
the
picture
of
the
dainty
little
and
the
young
lady
behind
it
the
tea
which
she
was
beginning
to
pour
out
smelt
so
refreshing
and
her
hand
and
figure
looked
so
pretty
in
the
operation
that
with
a
sigh
of
departing
resolution
he
gave
in
put
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
sat
down
opposite
to
the
tempter
grey
took
a
cup
of
tea
and
then
another
he
thought
he
had
never
tasted
anything
so
good
the
delicious
rich
cream
and
the
tempting
plate
of
bread
and
butter
were
too
much
for
him
he
fairly
gave
way
and
resigned
himself
to
physical
enjoyment
and
sipped
his
tea
and
looked
over
his
cup
at
mary
sitting
there
bright
and
kind
and
ready
to
go
on
pouring
out
for
him
to
any
extent
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
an
atmosphere
of
light
and
joy
surrounded
her
within
the
circle
of
which
he
was
sitting
and
absorbing
tea
was
the
only
stimulant
that
grey
ever
took
and
he
had
more
need
of
it
than
usual
for
he
had
given
away
the
chop
which
was
his
ordinary
dinner
to
a
starving
woman
he
was
faint
with
fasting
and
the
bad
air
of
the
hovels
in
which
he
had
been
spending
his
morning
the
elegance
of
the
room
the
smell
of
the
flowers
the
charm
of
companionship
with
a
young
woman
of
his
own
rank
and
the
contrast
of
the
whole
to
his
common
way
of
life
carried
him
away
and
hopes
and
thoughts
began
to
creep
into
his
head
to
which
he
had
long
been
a
stranger
mary
did
her
very
best
to
make
his
visit
pleasant
to
him
she
had
a
great
respect
for
the
life
which
she
knew
he
was
leading
and
the
nervousness
and
shyness
of
his
manners
were
of
a
kind
which
instead
of
infecting
her
gave
her
confidence
and
made
her
feel
quite
at
her
ease
with
him
she
was
so
grateful
to
him
for
having
delivered
her
out
of
her
recent
embarrassment
that
she
was
more
than
usually
kind
in
her
manner
she
saw
how
he
was
enjoying
himself
and
thought
what
good
it
must
do
him
to
forget
his
usual
occupations
for
a
short
time
so
she
talked
positive
gossip
to
him
risked
his
opinion
on
riding
habits
and
very
soon
was
telling
him
the
plot
of
a
new
novel
which
she
had
just
been
reading
with
an
animation
and
playfulness
which
would
have
warmed
the
heart
of
an
anchorite
for
a
short
quarter
of
an
hour
grey
resigned
himself
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
became
suddenly
and
painfully
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
and
stopped
himself
short
in
the
middle
of
an
altogether
worldly
compliment
which
he
detected
himself
in
the
act
of
paying
to
his
too
fascinating
young
hostess
he
felt
that
retreat
was
his
only
chance
and
so
grasped
his
hat
again
and
rose
with
a
deep
sigh
and
a
sudden
change
of
manner
which
alarmed
mary
i
hope
you
are
not
ill
mr
grey
she
said
anxiously
no
not
the
least
thank
you
but
but
in
short
i
must
go
to
my
work
i
ought
to
apologize
indeed
for
having
stayed
so
long
oh
you
have
not
been
here
more
than
twenty
minutes
pray
stay
and
see
mamma
she
must
be
in
directly
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
i
should
like
it
very
much
but
indeed
i
can
not
mary
felt
that
it
would
be
no
kindness
to
press
it
further
and
so
rose
herself
and
held
out
her
hand
grey
took
it
and
it
is
not
quite
certain
to
this
day
whether
he
did
not
press
it
in
that
farewell
shake
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
if
he
did
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
he
administered
exemplary
punishment
to
himself
afterwards
for
so
doing
he
would
gladly
have
left
now
but
his
conscience
forbade
it
he
had
forgotten
his
office
he
thought
hitherto
but
there
was
time
yet
not
to
be
altogether
false
to
it
so
he
looked
grave
and
shy
again
and
said
you
will
not
be
offended
with
me
miss
porter
if
i
speak
to
you
as
a
clergyman
mary
was
a
little
disconcerted
but
answered
almost
immediately
oh
no
pray
say
anything
which
you
think
you
ought
to
say
i
am
afraid
there
must
be
a
great
temptation
in
living
always
in
beautiful
rooms
like
this
with
no
one
but
prosperous
people
do
you
not
think
so
but
one
can
not
help
it
surely
grey
you
do
not
think
it
can
be
wrong
no
not
wrong
but
it
must
be
very
trying
it
must
be
very
necessary
to
do
something
to
lessen
the
temptation
of
such
a
life
i
do
not
understand
you
what
could
one
do
might
you
not
take
up
some
work
which
would
not
be
pleasant
such
as
visiting
the
poor
i
should
be
very
glad
but
we
do
not
know
any
poor
people
in
london
there
are
very
miserable
districts
near
here
yes
and
papa
and
mamma
are
very
kind
i
know
in
helping
whenever
they
can
hear
of
a
proper
case
but
it
is
so
different
from
the
country
there
it
is
so
easy
and
pleasant
to
go
into
the
cottages
where
everyone
knows
you
and
most
of
the
people
work
for
papa
and
one
is
sure
of
being
welcomed
and
that
nobody
will
be
rude
but
here
i
should
be
afraid
it
would
seem
so
impertinent
to
go
to
people
houses
of
whom
one
knows
nothing
i
should
never
know
what
to
say
it
is
not
easy
or
pleasant
duty
which
is
the
best
for
us
great
cities
could
never
be
evangelized
miss
porter
if
all
ladies
thought
as
you
do
i
think
grey
said
mary
rather
nettled
that
everyone
has
not
the
gift
of
lecturing
the
poor
and
setting
them
right
and
if
they
have
not
they
had
better
not
try
to
do
it
and
as
for
the
rest
there
is
plenty
of
the
same
kind
of
work
to
be
done
i
believe
amongst
the
people
of
one
own
class
you
are
joking
miss
porter
no
i
am
not
joking
at
all
i
believe
that
rich
people
are
quite
as
unhappy
as
poor
their
troubles
are
not
the
same
of
course
and
are
generally
of
their
own
making
but
troubles
of
the
mind
are
worse
surely
than
troubles
of
the
body
certainly
and
it
is
the
highest
work
of
the
ministry
to
deal
with
spiritual
trials
but
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
that
i
can
not
think
this
is
the
proper
work
for
for
for
me
you
would
say
we
must
be
speaking
of
quite
different
things
i
am
sure
i
only
mean
that
i
can
listen
to
the
troubles
and
grievances
of
anyone
who
likes
to
talk
of
them
to
me
and
try
to
comfort
them
a
little
and
to
make
things
look
brighter
and
to
keep
cheerful
it
is
not
easy
always
even
to
do
this
it
is
not
indeed
but
would
it
not
be
easier
if
you
could
do
as
i
suggest
going
out
of
one
own
class
and
trying
to
care
for
and
help
the
poor
braces
the
mind
more
than
anything
else
you
ought
to
know
my
cousin
katie
said
mary
glad
to
make
a
diversion
that
is
just
what
she
would
say
indeed
i
think
you
must
have
seen
her
at
oxford
did
you
not
i
believe
i
had
the
honor
of
meeting
her
at
the
rooms
of
a
friend
i
think
he
said
she
was
also
a
cousin
of
his
brown
you
mean
yes
did
you
know
him
oh
yes
you
will
think
it
strange
as
we
are
so
very
unlike
but
i
knew
him
better
than
i
knew
almost
any
one
poor
katie
is
very
anxious
about
him
i
hope
you
thought
well
of
him
you
do
not
think
he
is
likely
to
go
very
wrong
no
indeed
i
could
wish
he
were
sounder
on
church
questions
but
that
may
come
do
you
know
that
he
is
in
london
i
had
heard
so
he
has
been
several
times
to
my
schools
he
used
to
help
me
at
oxford
and
has
a
capital
way
with
the
boys
at
this
moment
the
clock
on
the
struck
a
quarter
the
sound
touched
some
chord
in
grey
which
made
him
grasp
his
hat
again
and
prepare
for
another
attempt
to
get
away
i
hope
you
will
pardon
he
pulled
himself
up
short
in
the
fear
lest
he
were
going
again
to
be
false
as
he
deemed
it
to
his
calling
and
stood
the
picture
of
nervous
discomfort
mary
came
to
his
relief
i
am
sorry
you
must
go
grey
she
said
i
should
have
so
liked
to
have
talked
to
you
more
about
oxford
you
will
call
again
soon
i
hope
at
which
last
speech
grey
casting
an
imploring
glance
at
her
muttered
something
which
she
could
not
catch
and
fled
from
the
room
mary
stood
looking
dreamily
out
of
the
window
for
a
few
minutes
till
the
entrance
of
her
mother
roused
her
and
she
turned
to
pour
out
a
cup
of
tea
for
her
it
is
cold
mamma
dear
do
let
me
make
some
fresh
no
thank
you
dear
this
will
do
very
well
said
porter
and
she
took
off
her
bonnet
and
sipped
the
cold
tea
mary
watched
her
silently
for
a
minute
and
then
taking
the
letter
she
had
been
reading
out
of
her
pocket
said
i
have
a
letter
from
katie
mamma
porter
took
the
letter
and
read
it
and
as
mary
still
watched
she
saw
a
puzzled
look
coming
over
her
mother
face
porter
finished
the
letter
and
then
looked
stealthily
at
mary
who
on
her
side
was
now
busily
engaged
in
putting
up
the
it
is
very
embarrassing
said
porter
what
mamma
oh
of
course
my
dear
i
mean
katie
telling
us
of
her
cousin
being
in
london
and
sending
us
his
address
and
then
she
paused
why
mamma
your
papa
will
have
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
will
ask
him
to
the
house
katie
would
surely
never
have
told
him
that
she
has
written
and
brown
were
so
very
kind
it
would
seem
so
strange
so
ungrateful
not
to
ask
him
i
am
afraid
he
is
not
the
sort
of
young
man
in
short
i
must
speak
to
your
papa
porter
looked
hard
at
her
daughter
who
was
still
busied
with
the
she
had
risen
bonnet
in
hand
to
leave
the
room
but
now
changed
her
mind
and
crossing
to
her
daughter
put
her
arm
round
her
neck
mary
looked
up
steadily
into
her
eyes
then
blushed
slightly
and
said
quietly
no
mamma
indeed
it
is
not
as
you
think
her
mother
stooped
and
kissed
her
and
left
the
room
telling
her
to
get
dressed
as
the
carriage
would
be
round
in
a
few
minutes
her
trials
for
the
day
were
not
over
she
could
see
by
their
manner
at
dinner
that
her
father
and
mother
had
been
talking
about
her
her
father
took
her
to
a
ball
in
the
evening
where
they
met
st
cloud
who
fastened
himself
to
them
she
was
dancing
a
quadrille
and
her
father
stood
near
her
talking
confidentially
to
st
cloud
in
the
intervals
of
the
dance
scraps
of
their
conversation
reached
her
you
knew
him
then
at
oxford
yes
very
slightly
i
should
like
to
ask
you
now
as
a
friend
here
mary
partner
reminded
her
that
she
ought
to
be
dancing
when
she
had
returned
to
her
place
again
she
heard
you
think
then
that
it
was
a
bad
business
it
was
notorious
in
the
college
we
never
had
any
doubt
on
the
subject
my
niece
has
told
porter
that
there
really
was
nothing
wrong
in
it
indeed
i
am
happy
to
hear
it
i
should
like
to
think
well
of
him
as
he
is
a
connexion
of
my
wife
in
other
respects
now
here
again
she
was
carried
away
by
the
dance
when
she
returned
she
caught
the
end
of
a
sentence
of
st
cloud
you
will
consider
what
i
have
said
in
confidence
certainly
answered
porter
and
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
and
then
the
dance
was
over
and
mary
returned
to
her
father
side
she
had
never
enjoyed
a
ball
less
than
this
and
persuaded
her
father
to
leave
early
which
he
was
delighted
to
do
when
she
reached
her
own
room
mary
took
off
her
wreath
and
ornaments
and
then
sat
down
and
fell
into
a
brown
study
which
lasted
for
some
time
at
last
she
roused
herself
with
a
sigh
and
thought
she
had
never
had
so
tiring
a
day
though
she
could
hardly
tell
why
and
felt
half
inclined
to
have
a
good
cry
if
she
could
only
have
made
up
her
mind
what
about
however
being
a
sensible
young
woman
she
resisted
the
temptation
and
hardly
taking
the
trouble
to
roll
up
her
hair
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
porter
found
his
wife
sitting
up
for
him
they
were
evidently
both
full
of
the
same
subject
well
dear
she
said
as
he
entered
the
room
porter
put
down
his
candle
and
shook
his
head
you
do
think
katie
can
be
right
then
she
must
have
capital
opportunities
of
judging
you
know
dear
but
she
is
no
judge
what
can
a
girl
like
katie
know
about
such
things
well
dear
do
you
know
i
really
can
not
think
there
was
anything
very
wrong
though
i
did
think
so
at
first
i
own
but
i
find
that
his
character
was
bad
decidedly
bad
always
young
st
cloud
did
like
to
say
much
to
me
which
was
natural
of
course
young
men
never
like
to
betray
one
another
but
i
could
see
what
he
thought
he
is
a
young
man
and
very
agreeable
i
do
not
take
to
him
very
much
his
connexions
and
prospects
too
are
capital
i
sometimes
think
he
has
a
fancy
for
mary
have
you
remarked
it
yes
dear
but
as
to
the
other
matter
shall
you
ask
him
here
well
dear
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
need
he
is
only
in
town
i
suppose
for
a
short
time
and
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
we
should
know
where
he
is
you
see
but
if
he
should
call
of
course
then
we
must
be
civil
we
can
consider
then
what
is
to
be
done
chapter
xliv
the
intercepted
dear
katie
at
home
you
see
without
having
answered
your
last
kind
letter
of
counsel
and
sympathy
but
i
could
write
in
town
i
was
in
such
a
queer
state
all
the
time
i
enjoyed
nothing
not
even
the
match
at
lord
or
the
race
only
walking
at
night
in
the
square
and
watching
her
window
and
seeing
her
at
a
distance
in
rotten
row
i
followed
your
advice
at
last
though
it
went
against
the
grain
uncommonly
it
did
seem
so
unlike
what
i
had
a
right
to
expect
from
them
after
all
the
kindness
my
father
and
mother
had
shown
them
when
they
came
into
our
neighborhood
and
after
i
had
been
so
intimate
there
running
in
and
out
just
like
a
son
of
their
own
that
they
should
take
the
slightest
notice
of
me
all
the
time
i
was
in
london
i
should
have
wondered
if
you
explained
but
after
that
and
after
you
had
told
them
my
direction
and
when
they
knew
that
i
was
within
five
walk
of
their
house
constantly
for
they
knew
all
about
schools
and
that
i
was
there
three
or
four
times
a
week
i
do
think
it
was
too
bad
however
as
i
was
going
to
tell
you
i
went
at
last
for
i
could
leave
town
without
trying
to
see
her
and
i
believe
i
have
finished
it
all
off
i
do
know
i
very
low
about
it
at
any
rate
and
want
to
tell
you
all
that
passed
and
to
hear
what
you
think
i
have
no
one
to
consult
but
you
katie
what
should
i
do
without
you
but
you
were
born
to
help
and
comfort
all
the
world
i
sha
rest
till
i
know
what
you
think
about
this
last
crisis
in
my
history
i
put
off
going
till
my
last
day
in
town
and
then
called
twice
the
first
time
at
home
but
i
was
determined
now
to
see
somebody
and
make
out
something
so
i
left
my
card
and
a
message
that
as
i
was
leaving
town
next
day
i
would
call
again
when
i
called
again
at
i
was
shown
into
the
library
and
presently
your
uncle
came
in
i
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
i
think
he
did
too
but
he
shook
hands
cordially
enough
asked
why
i
had
not
called
before
and
said
he
was
sorry
to
hear
i
was
going
out
of
town
so
soon
do
you
believe
he
meant
it
i
did
but
it
put
me
out
because
it
made
it
look
as
if
it
had
been
my
fault
that
i
had
been
there
before
i
said
i
did
know
that
he
would
have
liked
me
to
call
but
i
felt
that
he
had
got
the
best
of
the
start
then
he
asked
after
all
at
home
and
talked
of
his
boys
and
how
they
were
getting
on
at
school
by
this
time
i
had
got
my
head
again
so
i
went
back
to
my
calling
and
said
that
i
had
felt
that
i
could
never
come
to
their
house
as
a
common
acquaintance
and
as
i
did
not
know
whether
they
would
ever
let
me
come
in
any
other
capacity
i
had
kept
away
till
now
your
uncle
did
like
it
i
know
for
he
got
up
and
walked
about
and
then
said
he
did
understand
me
well
i
was
quite
reckless
by
this
time
it
was
my
last
chance
i
felt
so
i
looked
hard
into
my
hat
and
said
that
i
had
been
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
mary
for
two
years
of
course
there
was
no
getting
out
of
the
business
after
that
i
kept
on
staring
into
my
hat
so
i
do
know
how
he
took
it
but
the
first
thing
he
said
was
that
he
had
had
some
suspicions
of
this
and
now
my
confession
gave
him
a
right
to
ask
me
several
questions
in
the
first
place
had
i
ever
spoken
to
her
no
never
directly
what
did
i
mean
by
directly
i
meant
that
i
had
never
either
spoken
or
written
to
her
on
the
subject
in
fact
i
had
seen
her
except
at
a
distance
for
the
last
two
years
but
i
could
not
say
that
she
might
not
have
found
it
out
from
my
manner
had
i
ever
told
anyone
else
no
and
this
was
quite
true
katie
for
both
you
and
hardy
found
it
out
he
took
a
good
many
turns
before
speaking
again
then
he
said
i
had
acted
as
a
gentleman
hitherto
and
he
should
be
very
plain
with
me
of
course
i
must
see
that
looking
at
my
prospects
and
his
daughter
it
could
not
be
an
engagement
which
he
could
look
on
with
much
favor
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
nevertheless
he
had
the
highest
respect
and
regard
for
my
family
so
that
if
in
some
years
time
i
was
in
a
position
to
marry
he
should
not
object
on
this
score
but
there
were
other
matters
which
were
in
his
eyes
of
more
importance
he
had
heard
who
could
have
told
him
that
i
had
taken
up
very
violent
opinions
opinions
which
to
say
nothing
more
of
them
would
very
much
damage
my
prospects
of
success
in
life
and
that
i
was
in
the
habit
of
associating
with
the
advocates
of
such
opinions
persons
who
he
must
say
were
not
fit
companions
for
a
gentleman
and
of
writing
violent
articles
in
low
revolutionary
newspapers
such
as
the
yes
i
confessed
i
had
written
would
i
give
up
these
things
i
had
a
great
mind
to
say
flat
no
and
i
believe
i
ought
to
have
but
as
his
tone
was
kind
i
could
help
trying
to
meet
him
so
i
said
i
would
give
up
writing
or
speaking
publicly
about
such
matters
but
i
could
pretend
not
to
believe
what
i
did
believe
perhaps
as
my
opinions
had
altered
so
much
already
very
likely
they
might
again
he
seemed
to
be
rather
amused
at
that
and
said
he
sincerely
hoped
they
might
but
now
came
the
most
serious
point
he
had
heard
very
bad
stories
of
me
at
oxford
but
he
would
not
press
me
with
them
there
were
too
few
young
men
whose
lives
would
bear
looking
into
for
him
to
insist
much
on
such
matters
and
he
was
ready
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
but
i
must
remember
that
he
had
himself
seen
me
in
one
very
awkward
position
i
broke
in
and
said
i
had
hoped
that
had
been
explained
to
him
i
could
not
defend
my
oxford
life
or
could
not
defend
myself
as
to
this
particular
case
at
one
time
but
there
had
been
nothing
in
it
that
i
was
ashamed
of
since
before
the
time
i
knew
his
daughter
on
my
honour
had
i
absolutely
and
entirely
broken
off
all
relations
with
her
he
had
been
told
that
i
still
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
her
yes
i
still
wrote
to
her
and
saw
her
occasionally
but
it
was
only
to
give
her
news
of
a
young
man
from
her
village
who
was
now
serving
in
india
he
had
no
other
way
of
communicating
with
her
it
was
a
most
curious
arrangement
did
i
mean
that
this
young
man
was
going
to
be
married
to
her
i
hoped
so
why
should
he
not
write
to
her
at
once
if
they
were
engaged
to
be
married
they
were
not
exactly
engaged
it
was
rather
hard
to
explain
here
your
uncle
seemed
to
lose
patience
for
he
interrupted
me
and
said
it
must
be
clear
to
me
as
a
reasonable
man
that
if
this
connexion
were
not
absolutely
broken
off
there
must
be
an
end
of
everything
so
far
as
his
daughter
was
concerned
would
i
give
my
word
of
honor
to
break
it
off
at
once
and
completely
i
tried
to
explain
again
but
he
would
have
nothing
but
or
dear
katie
what
could
i
do
i
have
written
to
patty
that
till
i
die
she
may
always
reckon
on
me
as
on
a
brother
and
i
promised
harry
never
to
lose
sight
of
her
and
to
let
her
know
everything
that
happens
to
him
your
uncle
would
not
hear
me
so
i
said
no
and
he
said
our
interview
had
better
end
and
rang
the
bell
somebody
i
sure
has
been
slandering
me
to
him
who
can
it
be
i
did
say
another
word
or
offer
to
shake
hands
but
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
room
as
it
was
no
good
waiting
for
the
servant
to
come
when
i
got
into
the
hall
the
front
door
was
open
and
i
heard
her
voice
i
stopped
dead
short
she
was
saying
something
to
some
people
who
had
been
out
riding
with
her
the
next
moment
the
door
shut
and
she
tripped
in
in
her
and
grey
gloves
and
hat
with
the
dearest
little
grey
plume
in
it
she
went
humming
along
and
up
six
or
eight
steps
without
seeing
me
then
i
moved
a
step
and
she
stopped
and
looked
and
gave
a
start
i
do
know
whether
my
face
was
awfully
miserable
but
when
our
eyes
met
her
seemed
to
fill
with
pity
and
uneasiness
and
inquiry
and
the
bright
look
to
melt
away
altogether
and
then
she
blushed
and
ran
down
stairs
again
and
held
out
her
hand
saying
am
so
glad
to
see
you
after
all
this
long
time
i
pressed
it
but
i
do
think
i
said
anything
i
forget
the
butler
came
into
the
hall
and
stood
by
the
door
she
paused
another
moment
looked
confused
and
then
as
the
library
door
opened
went
away
up
stairs
with
a
kind
she
dropped
a
little
bunch
of
violets
which
she
had
worn
in
the
breast
of
her
habit
as
she
went
away
i
went
and
picked
them
up
although
your
uncle
had
now
come
out
of
the
library
and
then
made
the
best
of
my
way
into
the
street
there
katie
i
have
told
you
everything
exactly
as
it
happened
do
write
to
me
dear
and
tell
me
now
what
you
think
is
it
all
over
what
can
i
do
can
you
do
anything
for
me
i
feel
it
is
better
in
one
respect
her
father
can
never
say
now
that
i
did
tell
him
all
about
it
but
what
is
to
happen
i
am
so
restless
i
can
settle
to
nothing
and
do
nothing
but
fish
i
moon
away
all
my
time
by
the
dreaming
but
i
mean
to
let
it
beat
me
much
longer
here
the
fourth
day
since
i
saw
her
i
came
away
the
next
morning
i
shall
give
myself
a
week
and
dear
do
write
me
a
long
letter
at
once
and
interpret
it
all
to
me
a
woman
knows
so
wonderfully
what
things
mean
but
do
make
it
out
better
than
you
really
think
nobody
can
stop
my
going
on
loving
her
that
a
comfort
and
while
i
can
do
that
and
do
know
she
loves
anybody
else
i
ought
to
be
happier
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
yes
i
ought
to
be
but
i
ai
i
will
be
though
see
if
i
wo
heigho
do
write
directly
my
dear
counsellor
to
your
affectionate
cousin
i
had
almost
forgotten
my
usual
budget
i
enclose
my
last
from
india
you
will
see
by
it
that
harry
is
getting
on
famously
i
am
more
glad
than
i
can
tell
you
that
my
friend
east
has
taken
him
as
his
servant
he
could
be
under
a
better
master
poor
harry
i
sometimes
think
his
case
is
more
hopeless
than
my
own
how
is
it
to
come
right
or
mine
englebourn
dear
cousin
you
will
believe
how
i
devoured
your
letter
though
when
i
had
read
the
first
few
lines
and
saw
what
was
coming
it
made
me
stop
and
tremble
at
first
i
could
have
cried
over
it
for
vexation
but
now
i
have
thought
about
it
a
little
i
really
do
not
see
any
reason
to
be
discouraged
at
any
rate
uncle
robert
now
knows
all
about
it
and
will
get
used
to
the
idea
and
mary
seems
to
have
received
you
just
as
you
ought
to
have
wished
that
she
should
i
am
thankful
that
you
have
left
off
pressing
me
to
write
to
her
about
you
for
i
am
sure
that
would
not
be
honorable
and
to
reward
you
i
enclose
a
letter
of
hers
which
came
yesterday
you
will
see
that
she
speaks
with
such
pleasure
of
having
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
that
you
need
not
regret
the
shortness
of
the
interview
you
could
not
expect
her
to
say
more
because
after
all
she
can
only
guess
and
i
can
not
do
more
than
answer
as
if
i
were
quite
innocent
too
i
am
sure
you
will
be
very
thankful
to
me
some
day
for
not
having
been
your
mouthpiece
as
i
was
so
very
near
being
you
need
not
return
the
letter
i
suppose
i
am
getting
more
hopeful
as
i
grow
older
indeed
i
am
sure
i
am
for
three
or
four
years
ago
i
should
have
been
in
despair
about
you
and
now
i
am
nearly
sure
that
all
will
come
right
but
indeed
cousin
tom
you
can
not
or
ought
not
to
wonder
at
uncle
robert
objecting
to
your
opinions
and
then
i
am
so
surprised
to
find
you
saying
that
you
think
you
may
very
likely
change
them
because
if
that
is
the
case
it
would
be
so
much
better
if
you
would
not
write
and
talk
about
them
unless
you
are
quite
convinced
of
such
things
as
you
write
in
that
dreadful
paper
you
really
ought
not
to
go
on
writing
them
so
very
much
as
if
you
believed
them
and
now
i
am
speaking
to
you
about
this
which
i
have
often
had
on
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
about
i
must
ask
you
not
to
send
me
that
any
more
i
am
always
delighted
to
hear
what
you
think
and
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
articles
you
mark
for
me
which
seems
very
fine
and
i
dare
say
you
quite
believe
it
all
when
you
write
it
only
i
am
afraid
lest
papa
or
anyone
of
the
servants
should
open
the
papers
or
get
hold
of
them
after
i
have
opened
them
for
i
am
sure
there
are
a
great
many
wicked
things
in
the
other
parts
of
the
paper
so
please
do
not
send
it
to
me
but
write
and
tell
me
yourself
anything
that
you
wish
me
to
know
of
what
you
are
thinking
about
and
doing
as
i
did
not
like
to
burn
the
papers
and
was
afraid
to
keep
them
here
i
have
generally
sent
them
on
to
your
friend
hardy
he
does
not
know
who
sends
them
and
now
you
might
send
them
yourself
straight
to
him
as
i
do
not
know
his
address
in
the
country
as
you
are
going
up
again
to
keep
a
term
i
wish
you
would
talk
them
over
with
him
and
see
what
he
thinks
about
them
you
will
think
this
very
odd
of
me
but
you
know
you
have
always
said
how
much
you
rely
on
his
judgment
and
that
you
have
learnt
so
much
from
him
so
i
am
sure
you
would
wish
to
consult
him
and
if
he
thinks
that
you
ought
to
go
on
writing
it
will
be
a
great
help
to
you
to
know
it
i
am
so
very
glad
to
be
able
to
tell
you
how
well
martha
is
getting
on
i
have
always
read
to
her
the
extracts
from
the
letters
from
india
which
you
have
sent
me
and
she
is
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
sending
them
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
is
and
always
has
been
attached
to
poor
widow
son
and
now
that
he
is
behaving
so
well
i
can
see
that
it
gives
her
great
pleasure
to
hear
about
him
only
i
hope
he
will
be
able
to
come
back
before
very
long
because
she
is
very
much
admired
and
is
likely
to
have
so
many
chances
of
settling
in
life
that
it
is
a
great
chance
whether
attachment
to
him
will
be
strong
enough
to
keep
her
single
if
he
should
be
absent
for
many
years
do
you
know
i
have
a
sort
of
superstition
that
your
fate
hangs
upon
theirs
in
some
curious
manner
the
two
stories
have
been
so
interwoven
and
that
they
will
both
be
settled
happily
much
sooner
than
we
dare
to
hope
even
just
now
do
think
my
dear
cousin
that
this
letter
is
cold
or
that
i
do
not
take
the
very
deepest
interest
in
all
that
concerns
you
you
and
mary
are
always
in
my
thoughts
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
would
not
do
for
you
both
which
i
thought
would
help
you
i
am
sure
it
would
do
you
harm
if
i
were
only
a
papa
is
much
as
usual
he
gets
out
a
good
deal
in
his
chair
in
the
sun
this
fine
weather
he
desires
me
to
say
how
glad
he
should
be
if
you
will
come
over
soon
and
pay
us
a
visit
i
hope
you
will
come
very
soon
ever
believe
me
dear
tom
your
affectionate
cousin
katie
november
dear
tom
i
hear
that
what
you
in
england
call
a
mail
is
to
leave
camp
this
evening
so
that
you
may
have
no
excuse
for
not
writing
to
me
constantly
i
am
sitting
down
to
spin
you
such
a
yarn
as
i
can
under
the
disadvantages
circumstances
in
which
this
will
leave
me
this
time
last
year
or
somewhere
thereabouts
i
was
enjoying
academic
life
with
you
at
oxford
and
now
here
i
am
encamped
at
some
unpronounceable
place
beyond
umbala
you
wo
be
much
the
wiser
for
that
what
do
you
know
about
umbala
i
did
myself
know
that
there
was
such
a
place
till
a
month
ago
when
we
were
ordered
to
march
up
here
but
one
lives
and
learns
marching
over
india
has
its
disagreeables
of
which
dysentery
and
dust
are
about
the
worst
a
lot
of
our
fellows
are
down
with
the
former
amongst
others
my
captain
so
i
am
in
command
of
the
company
if
it
were
not
for
the
glorious
privilege
of
grumbling
i
think
that
we
should
all
own
that
we
liked
the
life
moving
about
though
one
does
get
frozen
and
broiled
regularly
once
in
hours
suits
me
besides
they
talk
of
matters
coming
to
a
crisis
and
no
end
of
fighting
to
be
done
directly
you
know
more
about
what
going
on
from
the
papers
than
we
do
but
here
they
say
the
ball
may
begin
any
day
so
we
are
making
forced
marches
to
be
up
in
time
i
wonder
how
i
shall
like
it
perhaps
in
my
next
i
may
tell
you
how
a
bullet
sounds
when
it
comes
at
you
if
there
is
any
fighting
i
expect
our
regiment
will
make
their
mark
we
are
in
order
the
colonel
is
a
grand
fellow
and
the
regiment
feels
his
hand
down
to
the
youngest
drummer
boy
what
a
deal
of
good
i
will
do
when
i
a
colonel
i
duly
delivered
the
enclosure
in
your
last
to
your
convict
who
is
rapidly
ascending
the
ladder
of
promotion
i
am
disgusted
at
this
myself
for
i
have
had
to
give
him
up
and
there
never
was
such
a
jewel
of
a
servant
but
of
course
it
a
great
thing
for
him
he
is
covering
sergeant
of
my
company
and
the
smartest
coverer
we
have
too
i
have
got
a
regular
broth
of
a
boy
an
irishman
in
his
place
who
leads
me
a
dog
of
a
life
i
took
him
chiefly
because
he
very
nearly
beat
me
in
a
our
senior
major
is
a
pat
himself
and
it
seems
knew
something
of
powers
so
one
day
at
mess
he
offered
to
back
him
against
anyone
in
the
regiment
for
yards
my
captain
took
him
up
and
named
me
and
the
race
came
off
next
day
and
a
precious
narrow
thing
it
was
but
i
managed
to
win
by
a
neck
for
the
honor
of
the
old
school
he
is
a
lazy
creature
utterly
indifferent
to
fact
and
i
am
obliged
to
keep
the
brandy
flask
under
lock
and
key
but
the
humour
and
absolute
of
the
animal
impose
upon
me
and
i
really
think
he
is
attached
to
me
so
i
keep
him
on
grumbling
horribly
at
the
change
from
that
orderly
punctual
clean
accurate
convict
depend
upon
it
that
fellow
will
do
he
makes
his
way
everywhere
with
officers
and
men
he
is
a
gentleman
at
heart
and
by
the
way
you
would
be
surprised
at
the
improvement
in
his
manners
and
speech
there
is
hardly
a
taste
of
berkshire
left
in
his
he
has
read
all
the
books
i
could
lend
him
or
borrow
for
him
and
is
fast
picking
up
hindustanee
so
you
see
after
all
i
am
come
round
to
your
opinion
that
we
did
a
good
afternoon
work
on
that
precious
stormy
common
when
we
carried
off
the
convict
from
the
authorities
of
his
native
land
and
was
first
under
fire
as
you
are
a
performer
in
that
line
could
you
carry
off
his
sweetheart
and
send
her
out
here
after
the
sea
voyage
there
is
much
above
miles
to
come
by
dauk
and
tell
her
with
my
compliments
he
is
well
worth
coming
twice
the
distance
for
poor
fellow
it
is
a
bad
lookout
for
him
i
afraid
as
he
may
not
get
home
this
ten
years
and
though
he
is
a
kind
to
be
easily
lolled
there
are
serious
odds
against
him
even
if
he
keeps
all
right
i
almost
wish
you
had
never
told
me
his
story
we
are
going
into
cantonments
as
soon
as
this
expedition
is
over
in
a
splendid
pig
district
and
i
look
forward
to
some
real
sport
all
the
men
who
have
had
any
tell
me
it
beats
the
best
fox
hunt
all
to
fits
for
excitement
i
have
got
my
eye
on
a
famous
native
horse
who
is
to
be
had
cheap
the
brute
is
in
the
habit
of
kneeling
on
his
masters
and
tearing
them
with
his
teeth
when
he
gets
them
off
but
nothing
can
touch
him
while
you
keep
on
his
back
as
your
countrymen
say
i
shall
have
a
shy
at
him
if
i
can
get
him
at
my
price
i
nothing
more
to
say
there
nobody
you
knew
here
except
the
convict
sergeant
and
it
is
awfully
hard
to
fill
a
letter
home
unless
you
have
somebody
to
talk
about
yes
by
the
way
there
is
one
little
fellow
an
ensign
just
joined
who
says
he
remembers
us
at
school
he
ca
be
more
than
eighteen
or
nineteen
and
was
an
urchin
in
the
lower
school
i
suppose
when
we
were
leaving
i
do
remember
his
face
but
it
a
very
good
one
and
he
is
a
bright
gentlemanly
youngster
as
you
would
wish
to
see
his
name
is
jones
do
you
remember
him
he
will
be
a
godsend
to
me
i
have
him
to
chum
with
me
on
this
march
keep
up
your
letters
as
you
love
me
you
at
home
little
know
what
it
is
to
enjoy
a
letter
never
mind
what
you
put
in
it
anything
will
do
from
home
and
i
nobody
much
else
to
write
to
me
there
goes
the
why
i
ca
think
seeing
that
we
have
done
our
day
march
however
i
must
turn
out
and
see
what
up
december
i
have
just
fallen
on
this
letter
which
i
had
quite
forgotten
or
rather
had
fancied
i
had
sent
off
to
you
three
weeks
and
more
ago
my
baggage
has
just
come
to
hand
and
the
scrawl
turned
up
in
my
paper
cases
well
i
have
plenty
to
tell
you
now
at
any
rate
if
i
have
time
to
tell
it
that
which
stopped
me
short
sounded
in
consequence
of
the
arrival
of
one
of
the
aides
in
our
camp
with
the
news
that
the
enemy
was
over
the
sutlej
we
were
to
march
at
once
with
two
and
a
squadron
of
cavalry
on
a
fort
occupied
by
an
outlying
lot
of
them
which
commanded
a
ford
and
was
to
be
taken
and
destroyed
and
the
rascals
who
held
it
dispersed
after
which
we
were
to
join
the
main
army
our
colonel
had
the
command
so
we
were
on
the
route
within
an
hour
leaving
a
company
and
the
baggage
to
follow
as
it
could
and
from
that
time
to
this
forced
marching
and
hard
fighting
have
been
the
order
of
the
day
we
drew
first
blood
next
morning
the
enemy
were
in
some
force
outside
the
fort
and
showed
fight
in
very
rough
ground
covered
with
bushes
out
of
which
we
had
to
drive
them
which
we
did
after
a
sharp
struggle
and
the
main
body
drew
off
altogether
then
the
fort
had
to
be
taken
our
two
guns
worked
away
at
it
till
dark
in
the
night
two
of
the
gunners
who
volunteered
for
the
service
crept
close
up
to
the
place
and
reported
that
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
our
running
right
into
it
accordingly
the
colonel
resolved
to
rush
it
at
daybreak
and
my
company
was
told
off
to
lead
the
captain
being
absent
i
had
to
command
i
was
with
the
dear
old
chief
the
last
thing
at
night
getting
his
instructions
ten
minutes
with
him
before
going
into
action
would
make
a
hare
fight
there
was
cover
to
within
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
the
place
and
there
i
and
poor
little
jones
and
the
men
spent
the
night
in
a
dry
ditch
an
hour
before
daybreak
we
were
on
the
alert
and
served
out
rations
and
then
they
began
playing
tricks
on
one
another
as
if
we
were
out
for
a
junketing
i
sat
with
my
watch
in
my
hand
feeling
queer
and
wondering
whether
i
was
a
greater
coward
than
the
rest
then
came
a
streak
of
light
i
put
up
my
watch
formed
the
men
up
went
a
rocket
my
signal
and
out
into
the
open
we
went
at
the
double
we
had
got
over
a
third
of
the
ground
when
bang
went
the
fort
guns
and
the
were
whistling
about
our
ears
so
i
shouted
and
away
we
went
as
hard
as
we
could
go
i
was
obliged
to
go
ahead
you
see
because
every
man
of
them
knew
i
had
beaten
larry
their
best
runner
when
he
had
no
gun
to
carry
but
i
did
half
like
it
and
should
have
blessed
any
hole
or
bramble
which
would
have
sent
me
over
and
given
them
time
to
catch
me
but
the
ground
was
provokingly
level
and
so
i
was
at
the
first
mound
and
over
it
several
lengths
in
front
of
the
men
and
among
a
lot
of
black
fellows
serving
the
guns
they
came
at
me
like
wild
cats
and
how
i
got
off
is
a
mystery
i
parried
a
cut
from
one
fellow
and
dodged
a
second
a
third
rushed
at
my
left
side
i
just
caught
the
flash
of
his
tulwar
and
thought
it
was
all
up
when
he
jumped
into
the
air
shot
through
the
heart
by
sergeant
winburn
and
the
next
moment
master
larry
rushed
by
me
and
plunged
his
bayonet
into
my
friend
in
front
it
turned
me
as
sick
as
a
dog
i
ca
fancy
anything
more
disagreeable
than
seeing
the
operation
for
the
first
time
except
being
struck
oneself
the
supporting
companies
were
in
in
another
minute
with
the
dear
old
chief
himself
who
came
up
and
shook
hands
with
me
and
said
i
had
done
credit
to
the
regiment
then
i
began
to
look
about
and
missed
poor
little
jones
we
found
him
about
twenty
yards
from
the
place
with
two
through
him
stone
dead
and
smiling
like
a
child
asleep
we
buried
him
in
the
fort
i
cut
off
some
of
his
hair
and
sent
it
home
to
his
mother
her
last
letter
was
in
his
breast
pocket
and
a
lock
of
bright
brown
hair
of
some
one
i
sent
them
back
too
and
his
sword
since
then
we
have
been
with
the
army
and
had
three
or
four
general
actions
about
which
i
can
tell
you
nothing
except
that
we
have
lost
about
the
third
of
the
regiment
and
have
always
been
told
we
have
won
steps
go
fast
enough
my
captain
died
of
wounds
and
dysentery
a
week
ago
so
i
have
the
company
in
earnest
how
long
i
shall
hold
it
is
another
question
for
though
there
a
slack
we
have
done
with
sharp
work
yet
i
can
see
how
often
we
talked
years
ago
of
what
it
must
feel
like
going
into
battle
well
the
chief
thing
i
felt
when
the
grape
came
down
pretty
thick
for
the
first
time
as
we
were
advancing
was
a
sort
of
gripes
in
the
stomach
which
made
me
want
to
go
forward
stooping
but
i
did
give
in
to
it
the
chief
was
riding
close
behind
us
joking
the
youngsters
who
were
ducking
their
heads
and
so
cheery
and
cool
that
he
made
old
soldiers
of
us
at
once
what
with
smoke
and
dust
and
excitement
you
know
scarcely
anything
of
what
is
going
on
the
finest
sight
i
have
seen
is
the
artillery
going
into
action
nothing
stops
those
fellows
places
you
would
crane
at
out
hunting
they
go
right
over
guns
carriages
men
and
all
leaving
any
cavalry
got
out
here
well
behind
do
you
know
what
a
nullah
is
well
it
a
great
gap
like
a
huge
dry
canal
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
deep
we
were
halted
behind
one
in
the
last
great
fight
awaiting
the
order
to
advance
when
a
battery
came
up
at
full
gallop
we
all
made
sure
they
must
be
pulled
up
the
nullah
they
never
pulled
bridle
gun
right
turn
sang
out
the
subaltern
and
down
they
went
sideways
into
the
nullah
then
turn
up
the
other
bank
one
gun
after
another
the
horses
scrambling
like
cats
up
and
down
places
that
my
men
had
to
use
their
hands
to
scramble
up
and
away
on
the
other
side
to
within
yards
of
the
enemy
and
then
round
like
lightning
and
look
out
in
front
altogether
it
sickening
work
though
there
a
grand
sort
of
feeling
of
carrying
your
life
in
your
hand
they
say
the
sepoy
regiments
have
behaved
shamefully
there
is
no
sign
of
anything
like
funk
among
our
fellows
that
i
have
seen
sergeant
winburn
has
distinguished
himself
everywhere
he
is
like
my
shadow
and
i
can
see
he
tries
to
watch
over
my
precious
carcase
and
get
between
me
and
danger
he
would
be
a
deal
more
missed
in
the
world
than
i
except
you
old
friend
i
do
know
who
would
care
much
if
i
were
knocked
over
aunts
and
cousins
are
my
nearest
relations
you
know
i
never
was
a
snuffler
but
this
sort
of
life
makes
one
serious
if
one
has
any
reverence
at
all
in
one
you
be
glad
to
have
this
line
if
you
do
hear
from
me
again
i
often
thought
in
the
last
month
that
we
shall
never
see
one
another
again
in
this
world
but
whether
in
this
world
or
any
other
you
know
i
am
and
always
shall
be
your
affectionate
friend
h
east
camp
of
the
sutlej
january
dear
master
tom
the
captain
last
words
was
if
anything
happened
i
was
to
be
sure
to
write
and
tell
you
and
so
i
take
up
my
pen
though
you
will
know
as
i
am
not
used
to
writing
to
tell
you
the
misfortune
as
has
happened
to
our
regiment
because
if
you
was
to
ask
any
man
in
our
regiment
let
it
be
who
it
would
he
would
say
as
the
captain
was
the
best
officer
as
ever
led
men
not
but
what
there
a
many
of
them
as
will
go
to
the
front
as
brave
as
lions
and
do
value
shot
no
more
than
if
it
was
rotten
apples
and
men
as
is
men
will
go
after
such
but
is
the
captain
manners
and
ways
with
a
kind
word
for
any
poor
fellow
as
is
hurt
or
sick
and
tired
and
making
no
account
of
hisself
and
as
you
may
say
no
bounce
with
him
that
what
makes
the
difference
as
it
might
be
last
saturday
we
came
upon
the
enemy
where
he
was
posted
very
strong
with
guns
all
along
his
front
and
served
till
we
got
right
up
to
them
the
runners
being
cut
down
and
bayoneted
when
we
got
right
up
amongst
them
and
no
quarter
given
and
there
was
great
banks
of
earth
too
to
clamber
over
and
more
guns
behind
so
with
the
marching
up
in
front
and
losing
so
many
officers
and
men
our
regiment
was
that
wild
when
we
got
amongst
them
that
was
awful
to
see
and
if
there
was
any
prisoners
taken
it
was
more
by
mistake
than
not
me
and
three
or
four
more
settled
when
the
word
came
to
prepare
for
action
to
keep
with
the
captain
because
was
known
to
everyone
as
no
odds
would
stop
him
and
he
would
never
mind
hisself
the
dust
and
smoke
and
noise
was
that
thick
you
see
nor
hear
anything
after
our
regiment
was
in
action
but
so
far
as
i
seen
when
we
was
wheeled
into
line
and
got
the
word
to
advance
there
was
as
it
might
be
as
far
as
from
our
old
cottage
to
the
hawk
lynch
to
go
over
before
we
got
to
the
guns
which
was
playing
into
us
all
the
way
our
line
went
up
very
steady
only
where
men
was
knocked
down
and
when
we
came
to
within
a
matter
of
sixty
yards
the
officers
jumped
out
and
waved
their
swords
for
was
no
use
to
give
words
and
the
ranks
was
broken
by
reason
of
the
running
up
to
take
the
guns
from
the
enemy
me
and
the
rest
went
after
the
captain
but
he
being
so
light
of
foot
was
first
by
maybe
ten
yards
or
so
at
the
mound
and
so
up
before
we
was
by
him
but
though
they
was
all
round
him
like
bees
when
we
got
to
him
was
not
then
as
he
was
hit
there
was
more
guns
further
on
and
we
and
they
drove
on
all
together
and
though
they
was
beaten
being
fine
tall
men
and
desperate
there
was
many
of
them
fighting
hard
and
as
you
might
say
a
man
scarcely
knowed
how
he
got
hit
i
kept
to
the
captain
as
close
as
ever
i
could
but
there
was
times
when
i
had
to
mind
myself
just
as
we
came
to
the
last
gun
larry
that
the
servant
was
trying
by
hisself
to
turn
one
of
them
round
so
as
to
fire
on
the
enemy
as
they
took
the
river
to
the
back
of
their
lines
all
in
a
huddle
so
i
turned
to
lend
him
a
hand
and
when
i
looked
round
next
moment
there
was
the
captain
like
a
drunken
man
and
he
so
strong
and
lissom
up
to
then
and
never
had
a
scratch
since
the
war
begun
and
this
the
last
minute
of
it
pretty
nigh
for
the
enemy
was
all
cut
to
pieces
and
drowned
that
day
i
got
to
him
before
he
fell
and
we
laid
him
down
gently
and
did
the
best
we
could
for
him
but
he
was
bleeding
dreadful
with
a
great
gash
in
his
side
and
his
arm
broke
and
two
gunshot
wounds
our
surgeon
was
killed
and
was
hours
before
his
wounds
was
dressed
and
be
god
mercy
if
ever
he
gets
round
though
they
do
say
if
the
fever
and
dysentery
keeps
off
and
he
can
get
out
of
this
country
and
home
no
knowing
but
that
he
may
get
the
better
of
it
all
but
not
to
serve
with
the
regiment
again
for
years
to
come
i
hope
master
tom
as
i
told
you
all
the
captain
would
like
as
you
should
know
only
being
not
much
used
to
writing
i
hope
you
will
excuse
mistakes
and
if
so
be
that
it
wo
be
too
much
troubling
of
you
and
the
captain
should
go
home
and
you
could
write
to
say
as
things
was
going
on
at
home
as
before
which
the
captain
always
gave
to
me
to
read
when
the
mail
come
in
it
would
be
a
great
help
towards
keeping
up
a
good
heart
and
in
a
foreign
land
which
is
hard
at
times
to
do
there
is
some
things
which
i
make
bold
to
send
by
a
comrade
going
home
sick
i
do
know
as
they
will
seem
much
but
i
hope
as
you
will
accept
of
the
sword
which
belonged
to
one
of
her
officers
and
the
rest
to
her
also
on
account
of
what
was
in
the
last
piece
as
you
forwarded
i
send
a
letter
to
go
along
with
the
things
if
miss
winter
who
have
been
so
kind
or
you
would
deliver
the
same
to
whom
i
make
bold
to
send
my
respects
as
well
as
to
yourself
and
hoping
this
will
find
you
well
and
all
friends
from
your
respectful
henry
winburn
regiment
march
my
dear
tom
i
begin
to
think
i
may
see
you
again
yet
but
it
has
been
a
near
shave
i
hope
sergeant
winburn
letter
and
the
returns
in
which
i
see
i
was
put
down
dangerously
wounded
will
not
have
frightened
you
very
much
the
war
is
over
and
if
i
live
to
get
down
to
calcutta
you
will
see
me
in
the
summer
please
god
the
end
was
like
the
beginning
going
right
up
to
the
guns
our
regiment
is
frightfully
cut
up
there
are
only
men
left
under
arms
the
rest
dead
or
in
hospital
i
am
sick
at
heart
at
it
and
weak
in
body
and
can
only
write
a
few
lines
at
a
time
but
will
get
on
with
this
as
i
can
in
time
for
next
mail
since
beginning
this
letter
i
have
had
another
relapse
so
in
case
i
should
never
finish
it
i
will
say
at
once
what
i
most
want
to
say
winburn
has
saved
my
life
more
than
once
and
is
besides
one
of
the
noblest
and
bravest
fellows
in
the
world
so
i
mean
to
provide
for
him
in
case
anything
should
happen
to
me
i
have
made
a
will
and
appointed
you
my
executor
and
left
him
a
legacy
you
must
buy
his
discharge
and
get
him
home
and
married
to
the
englebourn
beauty
as
soon
as
possible
but
what
i
want
you
to
understand
is
that
if
the
legacy
is
enough
to
do
this
and
make
all
straight
with
her
old
curmudgeon
of
a
father
it
is
my
first
wish
that
whatever
will
do
it
should
be
made
up
to
him
he
has
been
in
hospital
with
a
bad
flesh
wound
and
has
let
out
to
me
the
whole
of
his
story
of
which
you
had
only
given
me
the
heads
if
that
young
women
does
not
wait
for
him
and
book
him
i
shall
give
up
all
faith
in
petticoats
now
that
done
i
feel
more
at
ease
let
me
see
i
have
written
for
six
weeks
and
more
just
before
our
last
great
fight
you
know
all
about
it
from
the
papers
long
before
you
get
this
a
bloody
business
i
am
loath
to
think
of
it
i
was
knocked
over
in
the
last
of
their
entrenchments
and
should
then
and
there
have
bled
to
death
had
it
not
been
for
winburn
he
never
left
me
though
the
killing
and
plundering
and
roystering
afterwards
was
going
on
all
around
and
strong
temptation
to
a
fellow
when
his
blood
is
up
and
he
sees
his
comrades
at
it
after
such
work
as
we
have
had
what
more
he
caught
my
irish
fellow
and
made
him
stay
by
me
too
and
between
them
they
managed
to
prop
me
up
and
stop
the
bleeding
though
it
was
touch
and
go
i
never
thought
they
would
manage
it
you
ca
think
what
a
curious
feeling
it
is
the
life
going
out
of
you
i
was
perfectly
conscious
and
knew
all
they
were
doing
and
saying
and
thought
quite
clearly
though
in
a
sort
of
dreamy
way
about
you
and
a
whole
jumble
of
people
and
things
at
home
it
was
the
most
curious
painless
mixture
of
dream
and
life
getting
more
dreamy
every
minute
i
do
suppose
i
could
have
opened
my
eyes
or
spoken
at
any
rate
i
had
no
wish
to
do
so
and
did
try
several
times
the
thought
of
death
came
close
to
me
and
whether
it
was
the
odd
state
i
was
in
or
what
else
i
do
know
but
the
only
feeling
i
had
was
one
of
intense
curiosity
i
should
think
i
must
have
lain
there
with
winburn
supporting
my
head
and
moistening
my
lips
with
for
four
or
five
hours
before
a
doctor
could
be
got
he
had
managed
to
drive
larry
about
till
he
had
found
or
borrowed
or
stolen
the
drink
and
then
kept
him
making
short
cruises
in
search
of
help
in
the
shape
of
ambulances
or
doctors
from
which
master
larry
always
came
back
without
the
slightest
success
my
belief
is
he
employed
those
precious
minutes
when
he
was
from
under
his
sergeant
eye
in
looting
at
last
winburn
got
impatient
and
i
heard
him
telling
larry
what
he
was
to
do
while
he
was
gone
himself
to
find
a
doctor
and
then
i
was
moved
as
gently
as
if
i
had
been
a
sick
girl
i
heard
him
go
off
with
a
limp
but
did
not
know
till
long
after
of
his
wound
larry
had
made
such
a
wailing
and
when
they
first
found
me
that
a
natural
reaction
now
set
in
and
he
began
gently
and
tenderly
to
run
over
in
his
mind
what
could
be
made
out
of
captin
and
what
would
become
of
his
things
i
found
out
this
partly
through
his
habit
of
talking
to
himself
and
partly
from
the
precaution
which
he
took
of
ascertaining
where
my
watch
and
purse
were
and
what
else
i
had
upon
me
it
tickled
me
immensely
to
hear
him
presently
i
found
he
was
examining
my
boots
which
he
pronounced
entirely
and
wondered
whether
he
could
get
them
on
the
would
never
want
them
and
he
then
proceeded
to
assert
while
actually
began
unlacing
them
that
the
would
never
have
but
for
the
boots
which
worth
ten
feet
in
a
furlong
to
any
man
is
too
late
now
but
would
i
like
to
run
him
agin
with
bare
feet
i
could
stand
that
and
just
opened
my
eyes
a
little
and
moved
my
hand
and
said
i
wanted
to
add
rascal
but
that
was
too
much
for
me
larry
face
of
horror
which
i
just
caught
through
my
eyes
would
have
made
me
roar
if
i
had
had
strength
for
it
i
believe
the
resolution
i
made
that
he
should
never
go
about
in
my
boots
helped
to
pull
me
through
but
as
soon
as
winburn
came
back
with
the
doctor
master
larry
departed
and
i
much
doubt
whether
i
shall
ever
set
eyes
on
him
again
in
the
flesh
not
if
he
can
help
it
certainly
the
regiment
what
left
of
it
is
away
in
the
punjaub
and
he
with
it
winburn
as
i
told
you
is
hard
hit
but
no
danger
i
have
great
hopes
that
he
will
be
invalided
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
will
escort
me
home
if
any
interest
of
mine
can
manage
it
and
the
dear
old
chief
is
so
kind
to
me
that
i
think
he
will
arrange
it
somehow
i
must
be
wonderfully
better
to
have
spun
such
a
yarn
writing
those
first
ten
lines
nearly
finished
me
a
week
ago
and
now
i
am
scarcely
tired
after
all
this
scrawl
if
that
rascal
larry
escapes
hanging
another
year
and
comes
back
home
i
will
run
him
and
thrash
his
head
off
there
is
something
marvelously
in
the
idea
of
sailing
for
old
england
again
and
i
mean
to
make
a
strong
fight
for
seeing
you
again
old
boy
god
bless
you
write
again
for
the
chance
directing
to
my
agents
at
calcutta
as
before
ever
your
but
and
affectionate
friend
east
chapter
xlv
master
term
one
more
look
into
the
old
college
where
we
have
spent
so
much
time
already
not
i
hope
altogether
unpleasantly
our
hero
is
up
in
the
summer
term
keeping
his
three
weeks
residence
the
necessary
preliminary
to
an
degree
we
find
him
sitting
in
hardy
rooms
tea
is
over
scouts
out
of
college
candles
lighted
and
silence
reigning
except
when
distant
sounds
of
mirth
come
from
some
undergraduates
rooms
on
the
opposite
side
of
quad
through
the
open
windows
hardy
is
deep
in
the
budget
of
indian
letters
some
of
which
we
have
read
in
the
last
chapter
and
tom
reads
them
over
again
as
his
friend
finishes
them
and
then
carefully
folds
them
up
and
puts
them
back
in
their
places
in
a
large
except
for
an
occasional
explanatory
remark
or
exclamation
of
interest
no
word
passes
until
hardy
finishes
the
last
letter
then
he
breaks
out
into
praises
of
the
two
harrys
which
gladdens
tom
heart
as
he
fastens
the
case
and
puts
it
back
in
his
pocket
saying
yes
you
wo
find
two
finer
fellows
in
a
long
summer
day
no
nor
in
twenty
and
you
expect
them
home
then
in
a
week
or
two
yes
i
think
so
just
about
the
time
i
shall
be
going
down
do
talk
about
going
down
you
have
been
here
a
week
just
a
week
one
out
of
three
three
weeks
wasted
in
keeping
one
master
term
why
ca
you
give
a
fellow
his
degree
quietly
without
making
him
come
and
kick
his
heels
here
for
three
weeks
you
ungrateful
dog
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
enjoyed
coming
back
and
sitting
in
dignity
in
the
bachelors
seats
in
chapel
and
at
the
bachelors
table
in
hall
and
thinking
how
much
wiser
you
are
than
the
undergraduates
besides
your
old
friends
want
to
see
you
and
you
ought
to
want
to
see
them
well
i
am
very
glad
to
see
something
of
you
again
old
fellow
i
do
find
that
a
year
absence
has
made
any
change
in
you
but
who
else
is
there
that
i
care
to
see
my
old
friends
are
gone
and
the
year
has
made
a
great
gap
between
me
and
the
youngsters
they
look
on
me
as
a
sort
of
don
of
course
they
do
why
you
are
a
sort
of
don
you
will
be
an
in
a
fortnight
and
a
member
of
convocation
very
likely
but
i
do
appreciate
the
dignity
i
can
tell
you
being
up
here
now
is
anything
but
enjoyable
you
have
never
broken
with
the
place
and
then
you
always
did
your
duty
and
have
done
the
college
credit
you
ca
enter
into
the
feelings
of
a
fellow
whose
connexion
with
oxford
has
been
quite
broken
off
and
who
wasted
three
parts
of
his
time
here
when
he
comes
back
to
keep
his
master
come
come
tom
you
might
have
read
more
certainly
with
benefit
to
yourself
and
college
and
taken
a
higher
degree
but
after
all
did
the
place
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
and
you
did
do
it
much
harm
i
do
like
to
see
you
in
this
sort
of
gloomy
state
it
is
natural
to
you
it
is
becoming
natural
you
have
seen
much
of
me
during
the
last
year
or
you
would
have
remarked
it
and
then
as
i
tell
you
oxford
when
one
has
nothing
to
do
in
it
but
to
moon
about
thinking
over
one
past
follies
and
sins
is
cheerful
it
never
was
a
very
cheerful
place
to
me
at
the
best
of
times
not
even
at
pulling
times
well
the
river
is
the
part
i
like
best
to
think
of
but
even
the
river
makes
me
rather
melancholy
now
one
feels
one
has
done
with
it
why
tom
i
believe
your
melancholy
comes
from
their
not
having
asked
you
to
pull
in
the
boat
perhaps
it
does
do
you
call
it
degrading
to
be
pulling
in
the
torpid
in
one
old
age
mortified
vanity
man
they
have
a
capital
boat
i
wonder
how
we
should
have
liked
to
have
been
turned
out
for
some
bachelor
just
because
he
had
pulled
a
good
oar
in
his
day
not
at
all
i
do
blame
the
young
ones
and
i
hope
to
do
my
duty
in
the
torpid
by
the
way
they
are
an
uncommonly
nice
set
of
youngsters
much
better
behaved
in
every
way
than
we
were
unless
it
is
that
they
put
on
their
best
manners
before
me
no
i
do
think
they
do
the
fact
is
they
are
really
fine
young
fellows
so
i
think
and
i
tell
you
what
jack
since
we
are
sitting
and
talking
our
minds
to
one
another
at
last
like
old
times
somebody
has
made
the
most
wonderful
change
in
this
college
i
rather
think
it
is
seeing
what
ambrose
is
now
and
thinking
what
it
was
in
my
time
and
what
an
uncommon
member
of
society
i
should
have
turned
out
if
i
had
had
the
luck
to
have
been
here
now
instead
of
then
that
makes
me
down
in
the
mouth
more
even
than
having
to
pull
in
the
torpid
instead
of
the
racing
boat
you
do
think
it
is
improved
then
think
why
it
is
a
different
place
altogether
and
as
you
are
the
only
new
tutor
it
must
have
been
your
doing
now
i
want
to
know
your
secret
i
no
secret
except
taking
a
real
interest
in
all
that
the
men
do
and
living
with
them
as
much
as
i
can
you
may
fancy
it
is
much
of
a
trial
to
me
to
steer
the
boat
down
or
run
on
the
bank
and
coach
the
crew
ah
i
remember
you
were
beginning
that
before
i
left
in
your
first
year
i
knew
that
would
answer
yes
the
fact
is
i
find
that
just
what
i
like
best
is
the
very
best
thing
for
the
men
with
very
few
exceptions
they
are
all
glad
to
be
stirred
up
and
meet
me
nearly
halfway
in
reading
and
in
everything
else
i
believe
they
would
make
me
captain
and
why
do
you
let
them
no
there
a
time
for
everything
i
go
in
in
the
scratch
fours
for
the
pewters
and
more
by
token
my
crew
won
them
two
years
running
look
at
my
trophies
and
he
pointed
to
two
pewter
pots
engraved
with
the
college
arms
which
stood
on
his
well
i
dare
say
you
right
but
what
does
the
president
say
oh
he
is
a
convert
did
you
see
him
on
the
bank
when
you
torpids
made
your
bump
the
other
night
no
you
do
mean
it
well
do
you
know
a
sort
of
vision
of
black
tights
and
a
hat
crossed
me
but
i
never
gave
it
a
second
thought
and
so
the
president
comes
out
to
see
the
ambrose
boat
row
seldom
misses
two
nights
running
then
me
out
and
bury
me
decently
have
you
seen
old
tom
walking
around
peckwater
lately
on
his
clapper
smoking
a
cigar
with
the
dean
of
christ
church
do
be
afraid
i
am
ready
for
anything
you
like
to
tell
me
draw
any
amount
you
like
on
my
faith
i
shall
honor
the
draft
after
that
the
president
is
a
bad
judge
of
an
oar
when
he
sets
his
mind
to
it
is
he
but
i
say
jack
no
sell
how
in
the
world
did
it
happen
i
believe
it
happened
chiefly
through
his
talks
with
me
when
i
was
first
made
tutor
he
sent
for
me
and
told
me
he
had
heard
i
encouraged
the
young
men
in
boating
and
he
must
positively
forbid
it
i
did
care
much
about
staying
up
so
i
was
pretty
plain
with
him
and
said
i
was
not
allowed
to
take
the
line
i
thought
best
in
such
matters
i
must
resign
at
the
end
of
the
term
he
assented
but
afterwards
thought
better
of
it
and
sent
for
me
again
and
we
had
several
encounters
i
took
my
ground
very
civilly
but
firmly
and
he
had
to
give
up
one
objection
after
another
i
think
the
turning
point
was
when
he
quoted
paul
on
me
and
said
i
was
teaching
boys
to
worship
physical
strength
instead
of
teaching
them
to
keep
under
their
bodies
and
bring
them
into
subjection
of
course
i
countered
him
there
with
tremendous
effect
the
old
boy
took
it
very
well
only
saying
he
feared
it
was
no
use
to
argue
further
in
this
matter
of
he
had
come
to
a
conclusion
not
without
serious
thought
many
years
before
however
he
came
round
quietly
and
so
he
has
on
other
points
in
fact
he
is
a
wonderfully
man
for
his
age
if
you
only
put
things
to
him
the
right
way
has
he
come
round
about
i
see
you
have
only
two
or
three
up
yes
we
have
given
up
taking
them
altogether
i
hope
that
may
come
soon
but
i
and
another
tutor
took
to
plucking
them
ruthlessly
at
matriculation
unless
they
were
quite
up
to
the
commoner
standard
the
consequence
was
a
row
in
common
room
we
stood
out
and
won
luckily
as
you
know
it
has
always
been
given
out
here
that
all
and
commoners
have
to
pass
the
same
college
examinations
and
to
attend
the
same
course
of
lectures
you
know
also
what
a
mere
sham
and
pretence
the
rule
had
become
well
we
simply
made
a
reality
of
it
and
in
answer
to
all
objectors
said
it
our
rule
or
not
if
it
is
we
are
bound
to
act
on
it
if
you
want
to
alter
it
there
are
the
regular
ways
of
doing
so
after
a
little
grumbling
they
let
us
have
our
way
and
the
consequence
is
that
velvet
is
getting
scarce
at
st
ambrose
what
a
blessing
what
other
miracles
have
you
been
performing
the
best
reform
we
have
carried
is
throwing
the
kitchen
and
cellar
open
to
the
undergraduates
that
just
the
sort
of
reform
we
should
have
appreciated
fancy
drysdale
lot
with
the
key
of
the
college
cellars
at
about
ten
on
a
shiny
night
you
do
quite
understand
the
reform
you
remember
when
you
were
an
undergraduate
you
could
give
a
dinner
in
college
and
you
had
to
buy
your
wine
anywhere
yes
and
awful
firewater
we
used
to
get
the
governor
supplied
me
like
a
wise
man
well
we
have
placed
the
college
in
the
relation
of
benevolent
father
every
undergraduate
now
can
give
two
dinners
a
term
in
his
own
rooms
from
the
kitchen
or
more
if
he
comes
and
asks
and
has
any
reason
to
give
we
take
care
that
they
have
a
good
dinner
at
a
reasonable
rate
and
the
men
are
delighted
with
the
arrangement
i
do
believe
there
are
three
men
in
the
college
now
who
have
hotel
bills
and
we
let
them
have
all
their
wine
out
of
the
college
cellars
that
what
i
call
good
common
sense
of
course
it
must
answer
in
every
way
and
you
find
they
all
come
to
you
almost
all
they
ca
get
anything
like
the
wine
we
give
them
at
the
price
and
they
know
it
do
you
make
them
pay
ready
money
the
dinners
and
wine
are
charged
in
their
battel
bills
so
they
have
to
pay
once
a
term
just
as
they
do
for
their
orders
at
commons
it
must
swell
their
battel
bills
awfully
yes
but
battel
bills
always
come
in
at
the
beginning
of
term
when
they
are
flush
of
money
besides
they
all
know
that
battel
bills
must
be
paid
in
a
small
way
it
is
the
best
thing
that
ever
was
done
for
ambrose
you
see
it
cuts
so
many
ways
keeps
men
in
the
college
knocks
off
the
most
objectionable
bills
at
inns
and
keeps
them
from
being
poisoned
makes
them
pay
their
bills
regularly
shows
them
that
we
like
them
to
be
able
to
live
like
gentlemen
and
lets
you
dons
know
what
they
are
all
about
and
how
much
they
spend
in
the
way
of
entertaining
yes
and
a
very
good
thing
for
them
too
they
know
that
we
shall
not
interfere
while
they
behave
like
gentlemen
oh
i
not
objecting
and
was
this
your
doing
too
no
a
joint
business
we
hatched
it
in
the
common
room
and
then
the
bursar
spoke
to
the
president
who
was
furious
and
said
we
were
giving
the
sanction
of
the
college
to
disgraceful
luxury
and
extravagance
luckily
he
had
not
the
power
of
stopping
us
and
now
is
convinced
the
goddess
of
common
sense
seems
to
have
alighted
again
in
the
quad
of
ambrose
you
never
leave
the
place
jack
now
you
beginning
to
get
everything
your
own
way
on
the
contrary
i
do
mean
to
stop
up
more
than
another
year
at
the
outside
i
have
been
tutor
nearly
three
years
now
about
long
enough
do
you
think
you
right
you
seem
to
have
hit
on
your
line
in
life
wonderfully
you
like
the
work
and
the
work
likes
you
you
are
doing
a
heap
of
good
up
here
you
be
president
in
a
year
or
two
depend
on
it
i
should
say
you
had
better
stick
to
oxford
no
i
should
be
of
no
use
in
a
year
or
two
we
want
a
constant
current
of
fresh
blood
here
in
a
general
way
but
you
do
get
a
man
every
day
who
can
throw
himself
into
the
men
pursuits
and
can
get
hold
of
them
in
the
right
way
and
then
after
all
when
a
fellow
has
got
such
work
cut
out
for
him
as
you
have
oxford
must
be
an
uncommonly
pleasant
place
to
live
in
pleasant
enough
in
many
ways
but
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
how
you
used
to
rail
against
it
yes
because
i
never
hit
off
the
right
ways
of
the
place
but
if
i
had
taken
a
first
and
got
a
fellowship
i
should
like
it
well
enough
i
dare
say
being
a
fellow
on
the
contrary
makes
it
worse
while
one
was
an
undergraduate
one
could
feel
virtuous
and
indignant
at
the
vices
of
oxford
at
least
at
those
which
one
did
not
indulge
in
particularly
at
the
flunkeyism
and
which
are
our
most
prevalent
and
disgraceful
sins
but
when
one
is
a
fellow
it
is
quite
another
affair
they
become
a
sore
burthen
then
enough
to
break
one
heart
why
jack
we
changing
characters
fancy
your
coming
out
in
the
abusive
line
why
i
never
said
harder
things
of
alma
mater
myself
however
there
plenty
of
flunkeyism
and
everywhere
else
yes
but
it
is
not
so
in
other
places
when
one
thinks
what
a
great
centre
of
learning
and
faith
oxford
ought
to
be
like
that
its
highest
educational
work
should
just
be
the
deliverance
of
us
all
from
flunkeyism
and
and
then
looks
at
matters
here
without
spectacles
it
gives
one
sometimes
a
sort
of
chilly
leaden
despondency
which
is
very
hard
to
struggle
against
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
jack
for
one
ca
help
loving
the
place
after
all
so
i
do
god
knows
if
i
did
i
should
care
for
its
shortcomings
well
the
flunkeyism
and
were
bad
enough
but
i
do
think
they
were
the
worst
things
at
least
not
in
my
day
our
neglects
were
almost
worse
than
our
worships
you
mean
the
want
of
all
reverence
for
parents
well
perhaps
that
lies
at
the
root
of
the
false
worships
they
spring
up
on
the
vacant
soil
and
the
want
of
reverence
for
women
jack
the
worst
of
all
to
my
mind
perhaps
you
are
right
but
we
are
not
at
the
bottom
yet
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
we
must
worship
god
before
we
can
reverence
parents
or
women
or
root
out
flunkeyism
and
yes
but
after
all
can
we
fairly
lay
that
sin
on
oxford
surely
whatever
may
be
growing
up
side
by
side
with
it
more
christianity
here
than
almost
anywhere
else
plenty
of
christianity
belief
in
a
dead
god
there
i
have
never
said
it
to
anyone
but
you
but
that
is
the
slough
we
have
to
get
out
of
do
think
that
i
despair
for
us
we
shall
do
it
yet
but
it
will
be
sore
work
stripping
off
the
comfortable
religion
in
which
we
are
wrapped
up
work
for
our
strongest
and
our
wisest
and
yet
you
think
of
leaving
there
are
other
reasons
i
will
tell
you
some
day
but
now
to
turn
to
other
matters
how
have
you
been
getting
on
this
last
year
you
write
so
seldom
that
i
am
all
oh
much
the
same
as
usual
then
you
are
still
like
one
of
those
who
went
out
to
david
no
i
not
in
debt
but
discontented
pretty
much
like
you
there
jack
however
content
is
no
virtue
that
i
can
see
while
there
anything
to
mend
who
is
going
to
be
contented
with
and
and
grinding
the
faces
of
the
poor
david
camp
was
a
better
place
than
saul
any
day
hardy
got
up
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
bundle
of
papers
which
tom
recognized
as
the
he
felt
rather
uncomfortable
as
his
friend
seated
himself
again
and
began
looking
them
over
you
see
what
i
have
here
he
said
tom
nodded
well
there
are
some
of
the
articles
i
should
like
to
ask
you
about
if
you
do
object
no
go
on
here
is
one
then
to
begin
with
i
wo
read
it
all
let
me
see
here
is
what
i
was
looking
for
and
he
began
reading
one
would
think
to
hear
these
landlords
our
rulers
talk
that
the
glorious
green
fields
the
deep
woods
the
everlasting
hills
and
the
rivers
that
run
among
them
were
made
for
the
sole
purpose
of
ministering
to
their
greedy
lusts
and
mean
ambitions
that
they
may
roll
out
amongst
unrealities
their
pitiful
mock
lives
from
their
silk
and
lace
cradles
to
their
spangled
coffins
studded
with
silver
knobs
and
lying
coats
of
arms
reaping
where
they
have
not
sown
and
gathering
where
they
have
not
strewed
making
the
omer
small
and
the
ephah
great
that
they
may
sell
the
refuse
of
the
wheat
that
do
jack
but
what
the
date
of
that
paper
july
last
is
it
yours
then
yes
and
i
allow
it
too
strong
and
i
have
given
up
writing
altogether
will
that
satisfy
you
i
do
see
my
own
way
clear
enough
yet
but
for
all
that
i
not
ashamed
of
what
i
wrote
in
that
paper
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
after
that
except
that
i
heartily
glad
you
have
given
up
writing
for
the
present
but
i
say
old
fellow
how
did
you
get
these
papers
and
know
about
my
articles
they
were
sent
me
shall
i
burn
them
now
or
would
you
like
to
have
them
we
need
say
anything
more
about
them
burn
them
by
all
means
i
suppose
a
friend
sent
them
to
you
i
suppose
so
hardy
went
on
burning
the
papers
in
silence
and
as
tom
watched
him
a
sudden
light
seemed
to
break
upon
him
i
say
jack
he
said
presently
a
little
bird
has
been
whispering
something
to
me
about
that
friend
hardy
winched
a
little
and
redoubled
his
diligence
in
burning
the
papers
tom
looked
on
smiling
and
thinking
how
to
go
on
now
that
he
had
so
unexpectedly
turned
the
tables
on
his
monitor
when
the
clock
struck
twelve
hullo
he
said
getting
up
time
for
me
to
knock
out
or
old
copas
will
be
in
bed
to
go
back
to
where
we
started
from
as
soon
as
east
and
harry
winburn
get
back
we
shall
have
some
jolly
doings
at
englebourn
there
be
a
wedding
i
hope
and
you
come
over
and
do
parson
for
us
wo
you
you
mean
for
patty
of
course
i
will
the
little
bird
whispered
to
me
that
you
would
dislike
visiting
that
part
of
the
old
county
good
night
jack
i
wish
you
success
old
fellow
with
all
my
heart
and
i
hope
after
all
that
you
may
leave
ambrose
within
the
year
chapter
xlvi
from
india
to
englebourn
if
a
knowledge
of
contemporary
history
must
be
reckoned
as
an
important
element
in
the
civilization
of
any
people
then
i
am
afraid
that
the
good
folk
of
englebourn
must
have
been
content
in
the
days
of
our
story
with
a
very
low
place
on
the
ladder
how
indeed
was
knowledge
to
percolate
so
as
to
reach
down
to
the
foundations
of
englebournian
society
the
stratum
on
which
all
others
rest
the
common
agricultural
labourer
producer
of
corn
and
other
grain
the
careful
and
stolid
nurse
and
guardian
of
youthful
oxen
sheep
and
pigs
many
of
them
far
better
fed
and
housed
than
his
own
children
as
she
is
one
can
not
help
wondering
that
she
did
not
give
up
englebourn
altogether
as
a
hopeless
job
so
far
as
written
periodical
instruction
is
concerned
with
the
exception
of
the
which
winter
had
taken
in
from
its
commencement
but
rarely
opened
the
supply
was
limited
to
at
most
half
a
dozen
weekly
papers
a
london
journal
sound
in
church
and
state
principles
most
respectable
but
not
otherwise
than
heavy
came
every
saturday
to
the
rectory
the
conservative
county
paper
was
taken
in
at
the
red
lion
and
david
the
constable
and
the
blacksmith
clubbed
together
to
purchase
the
liberal
paper
by
help
of
which
they
managed
to
wage
unequal
war
with
the
knot
of
village
quidnuncs
who
assembled
almost
nightly
at
the
bar
of
the
tory
beast
above
referred
to
that
king
of
beasts
red
indeed
in
colour
but
of
the
truest
blue
in
political
principle
besides
these
perhaps
three
or
four
more
papers
were
taken
by
the
farmers
but
scanty
as
the
food
was
it
was
quite
enough
for
the
mouths
indeed
when
the
papers
once
passed
out
of
the
parlours
they
had
for
the
most
part
performed
their
mission
few
of
the
male
or
female
had
curiosity
or
scholarship
enough
to
spell
through
the
dreary
columns
and
oral
teaching
was
not
much
more
plentiful
as
how
was
it
likely
to
be
englebourn
was
situated
on
no
trunk
road
and
the
amount
of
intercourse
between
it
and
the
rest
of
the
world
was
of
the
most
limited
kind
the
rector
never
left
home
the
curate
at
rare
intervals
most
of
the
farmers
went
to
market
once
a
week
and
dined
at
their
ordinary
discussing
county
politics
according
to
their
manner
but
bringing
home
little
except
as
much
food
and
drink
as
they
could
cleverly
carry
the
carrier
went
to
and
from
newbury
once
a
week
but
he
was
a
silent
man
chiefly
bent
on
collecting
and
selling
butter
the
postman
who
was
deaf
only
went
as
far
as
the
next
village
the
waggoners
drove
their
masters
produce
to
market
from
time
to
time
and
boozed
away
an
hour
or
two
in
the
kitchen
or
tap
or
of
some
small
in
the
nearest
town
while
their
horses
rested
with
the
above
exceptions
probably
not
one
of
the
villagers
strayed
ten
miles
from
home
from
year
end
to
end
as
to
visitors
an
occasional
peddler
or
small
commercial
traveller
turned
up
about
once
a
quarter
a
few
boys
and
girls
more
enterprising
than
their
fellows
went
out
altogether
into
the
world
of
their
own
accord
in
the
course
of
the
year
and
an
occasional
burly
ploughboy
or
carter
boy
was
entrapped
into
taking
the
queen
shilling
by
some
subtle
recruiting
sergeant
but
few
of
these
were
seen
again
except
at
long
intervals
the
yearly
village
feasts
harvest
homes
or
a
meet
of
the
hounds
on
englebourn
common
were
the
most
exciting
events
which
in
an
ordinary
way
stirred
the
surface
of
englebourn
life
only
faintest
and
most
distant
murmurs
of
the
din
and
strife
of
the
great
outer
world
of
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
the
fall
of
governments
and
the
throes
of
nations
reached
that
primitive
little
village
a
change
was
already
showing
itself
since
miss
winter
had
been
old
enough
to
look
after
the
schools
the
waters
were
beginning
to
stir
and
by
this
time
no
doubt
the
parish
boasts
a
regular
and
but
at
that
day
englebourn
was
like
one
of
those
small
ponds
you
may
find
in
some
nook
of
a
the
banks
grown
over
with
underwood
to
which
neither
man
nor
beast
scarcely
the
winds
of
heaven
have
any
access
when
you
have
found
such
a
pond
you
may
create
a
great
excitement
amongst
the
newts
and
frogs
who
inhabit
it
by
throwing
in
a
pebble
the
splash
in
itself
is
a
small
splash
enough
and
the
waves
which
circle
away
from
it
are
very
tiny
waves
but
they
move
over
the
whole
face
of
the
pond
and
are
of
more
interest
to
the
frogs
than
a
in
the
atlantic
so
the
approaching
return
of
harry
winburn
and
the
story
of
his
doings
at
the
wars
and
of
the
wonderful
things
he
had
sent
home
stirred
englebourn
to
its
depth
in
that
small
corner
of
the
earth
the
sergeant
was
of
far
more
importance
than
and
in
fact
it
was
probably
the
common
belief
that
he
was
somehow
the
head
of
the
whole
business
and
india
the
war
and
all
that
hung
thereon
were
looked
at
and
cared
for
only
as
they
had
served
to
bring
him
out
so
careless
were
the
good
folk
about
everything
in
the
matter
except
their
own
hero
and
so
wonderful
were
the
romances
which
soon
got
abroad
about
him
that
miss
winter
tired
of
explaining
again
and
again
to
the
old
women
without
the
slightest
effect
on
the
parochial
faith
bethought
her
of
having
a
lecture
on
the
subject
of
india
and
the
war
in
the
parish
schoolroom
full
of
this
idea
she
wrote
off
to
tom
who
was
the
medium
of
communication
on
indian
matters
and
propounded
it
to
him
the
difficulty
was
that
walker
the
curate
the
only
person
competent
to
give
it
was
going
away
directly
for
a
three
holiday
having
arranged
with
two
neighbouring
curates
to
take
his
sunday
duty
for
him
what
was
to
be
done
harry
might
be
back
any
day
it
seemed
so
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
could
tom
come
himself
and
help
her
tom
could
not
but
he
wrote
back
to
say
that
his
friend
hardy
was
just
getting
away
from
oxford
for
the
long
vacation
and
would
gladly
take
walker
duty
for
the
three
weeks
if
winter
approved
on
his
way
home
by
which
englebourn
would
not
be
without
an
efficient
parson
on
and
she
would
have
the
man
of
all
others
to
help
her
in
utilizing
the
sergeant
history
for
the
instruction
of
the
bucolic
mind
the
arrangement
moreover
would
be
particularly
happy
because
hardy
had
already
promised
to
perform
the
marriage
ceremony
which
tom
and
she
had
settled
would
take
place
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
after
the
return
of
the
indian
heroes
winter
was
very
glad
to
accept
the
offer
and
so
when
they
parted
at
oxford
hardy
went
to
englebourn
where
we
must
leave
him
for
the
present
tom
went
home
whence
in
a
few
days
he
had
to
hurry
down
to
southampton
to
meet
the
two
harrys
he
was
much
shocked
at
first
to
see
the
state
of
his
old
east
looked
haggard
and
pale
in
the
face
notwithstanding
the
sea
voyage
his
clothes
hung
on
him
as
if
they
had
been
made
for
a
man
of
twice
his
size
and
he
walked
with
difficulty
by
the
help
of
a
large
stick
but
he
had
lost
none
of
his
indomitableness
laughed
at
tom
long
face
and
declared
that
he
felt
himself
getting
better
and
stronger
every
day
if
you
had
only
seen
me
at
calcutta
he
said
you
would
sing
a
different
song
eh
winburn
harry
winburn
was
much
changed
and
had
acquired
all
the
composed
and
look
which
is
so
remarkable
in
a
good
officer
readiness
to
obey
and
command
was
stamped
on
every
line
of
his
face
but
it
required
all
his
powers
of
to
keep
within
bounds
his
delight
at
getting
home
again
his
wound
was
quite
healed
and
his
health
by
the
voyage
and
when
tom
saw
how
wonderfully
his
manners
and
carriage
were
improved
and
how
easily
his
uniform
sat
on
him
he
felt
quite
sure
that
all
would
soon
be
right
at
englebourn
and
that
katie
and
he
would
be
justified
in
their
prophecies
and
preparations
the
invalids
had
to
report
themselves
in
london
and
thither
the
three
proceeded
together
when
this
was
done
harry
winburn
was
sent
off
at
once
he
resisted
at
first
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
stay
with
his
captain
until
the
captain
could
go
to
berkshire
himself
but
he
was
by
this
time
too
much
accustomed
to
discipline
not
to
obey
a
positive
order
and
was
comforted
by
tom
assurance
that
he
would
not
leave
east
and
would
do
everything
for
him
which
the
sergeant
had
been
accustomed
to
do
three
days
later
as
east
and
tom
were
sitting
at
breakfast
a
short
note
came
from
miss
winter
telling
of
harry
arrival
how
the
bells
were
set
ringing
to
welcome
him
how
hardy
had
preached
the
most
wonderful
sermon
on
his
story
the
next
day
above
all
how
patty
had
surrendered
at
discretion
and
the
banns
had
been
called
for
the
first
time
so
the
sooner
they
would
come
down
the
better
as
it
was
very
important
that
no
time
should
be
lost
lest
some
of
the
old
jealousies
and
quarrels
should
break
out
again
upon
reading
and
considering
which
letter
east
resolved
to
start
for
englebourn
at
once
and
tom
to
accompany
him
there
was
one
person
to
whom
harry
return
and
approaching
wedding
was
a
subject
of
unmixed
joy
and
triumph
and
that
was
david
the
constable
he
had
always
been
a
sincere
friend
to
harry
and
had
stood
up
for
him
when
all
the
parish
respectabilities
had
turned
against
him
and
had
prophesied
that
he
would
live
to
be
a
credit
to
the
place
so
now
david
felt
himself
an
inch
higher
as
he
saw
harry
walking
about
in
his
uniform
with
his
sweetheart
the
admiration
of
all
englebourn
but
besides
all
the
unselfish
pleasure
which
david
enjoyed
on
his
young
friend
account
a
little
piece
of
private
and
personal
gratification
came
to
him
on
his
own
ever
since
courtship
had
begun
david
had
felt
himself
in
a
false
position
towards
and
had
suffered
under
old
simon
the
gardener
the
necessity
for
keeping
the
old
man
in
good
humor
for
harry
sake
had
always
been
present
to
the
constable
mind
and
for
the
privilege
of
putting
in
a
good
word
for
his
favorite
now
and
then
he
had
allowed
old
simon
to
assume
an
air
of
superiority
over
him
and
to
trample
upon
him
and
dogmatize
to
him
even
in
the
matters
of
flowers
and
bees
this
had
been
the
more
galling
to
david
on
account
of
old
simon
intolerant
toryism
which
the
constable
soul
rebelled
against
except
in
the
matter
of
church
music
on
this
point
they
agreed
but
even
here
simon
managed
to
be
unpleasant
he
would
lay
the
whole
blame
of
the
changes
which
had
been
effected
upon
david
accusing
him
of
having
given
in
where
there
was
no
need
as
there
was
nothing
but
a
wall
between
the
rectory
garden
and
david
little
strip
of
ground
in
which
he
spent
all
his
leisure
time
until
the
shades
of
evening
summoned
him
to
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
for
his
daily
pint
and
pipe
the
two
were
constantly
within
hearing
of
one
another
and
simon
in
times
past
had
seldom
neglected
an
opportunity
of
making
himself
disagreeable
to
his
neighbour
but
now
david
was
a
free
man
again
and
he
took
the
earliest
occasion
of
making
the
change
in
his
manner
apparent
to
simon
and
of
getting
as
he
called
it
upsides
with
him
one
would
have
thought
to
look
at
him
that
the
old
gardener
was
as
pachydermatous
as
a
rhinoceros
but
somehow
he
seemed
to
feel
that
things
had
changed
between
them
and
did
not
appreciate
an
interview
with
david
now
nearly
so
much
as
of
old
so
he
found
very
little
to
do
in
that
part
of
the
garden
which
abutted
on
the
constable
premises
when
he
could
not
help
working
there
he
chose
the
times
at
which
david
was
most
likely
to
be
engaged
or
even
took
the
trouble
to
ascertain
that
he
was
not
at
home
early
on
midsummer
day
old
simon
reared
his
ladder
against
the
boundary
wall
with
a
view
of
doctorin
some
of
the
fruit
trees
relying
on
a
parish
meeting
at
which
the
presence
was
required
but
he
had
not
more
than
half
finished
his
operations
before
david
had
returned
from
vestry
and
catching
sight
of
the
top
of
the
ladder
and
simon
head
above
the
wall
laid
aside
all
other
business
and
descended
into
the
garden
simon
kept
on
at
his
work
only
replying
by
a
jerk
of
the
head
and
one
of
his
grunts
to
his
neighbour
salutation
david
took
his
coat
off
and
his
pruning
knife
out
and
establishing
himself
within
easy
shot
of
his
old
oppressor
opened
fire
at
once
thy
consent
then
is
no
odds

or
none
her
old
enough
to
hev
her

simon
somewhat

seems
clear
about

miss
a
callin
and
old
simon
head
disappeared
as
he
descended
the
ladder
to
answer
the
summons
of
his
young
mistress
not
displeased
at
having
his
fears
as
to
the
safety
of
his
future
set
at
rest
by
so
eminent
a
legal
authority
as
the
constable
fortunately
for
harry
the
constable
law
was
not
destined
to
be
tried
young
wurley
was
away
in
london
old
tester
was
bedridden
with
an
accumulation
of
diseases
brought
on
by
his
bad
life
his
illness
made
him
more
violent
and
tyrannical
than
ever
but
he
could
do
little
harm
out
of
his
own
room
for
no
one
ever
went
to
see
him
and
the
wretched
who
attended
him
was
much
too
frightened
to
tell
him
anything
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
parish
there
was
no
one
else
to
revive
proceedings
against
harry
david
pottered
on
at
his
bees
and
his
flowers
till
old
simon
returned
and
ascended
his
ladder
again

said
as

david
was
preparing
a
stout
rejoinder
to
this
rebuke
of
the
old
retainer
of
the
winter
family
on
his
curiosity
but
was
summoned
by
his
wife
to
the
house
to
attend
a
customer
and
by
the
time
he
could
get
out
again
simon
had
disappeared
the
next
day
east
and
tom
arrived
and
took
possession
of
the
red
lion
and
englebourn
was
soon
in
a
ferment
of
preparation
for
the
wedding
east
was
not
the
man
to
do
things
by
halves
and
seconded
as
he
was
by
miss
winter
and
hardy
and
tom
had
soon
made
arrangements
for
all
sorts
of
merrymaking
the
were
to
have
a
whole
holiday
and
after
scattering
flowers
at
church
and
marching
in
the
bridal
procession
were
to
be
entertained
in
a
tent
pitched
in
the
home
paddock
of
the
rectory
and
to
have
an
afternoon
of
games
and
prizes
and
cake
and
tea
the
harry
old
comrades
were
to
have
five
shillings
apiece
and
a
cricket
match
and
a
dinner
afterwards
at
the
second
public
house
to
which
any
other
of
his
old
friends
whom
harry
chose
to
ask
were
to
be
also
invited
the
old
men
and
women
were
to
be
fed
in
the
village
and
east
and
tom
were
to
entertain
a
select
party
of
the
farmers
and
tradesmen
at
the
red
lion
the
tap
of
which
hostelry
was
to
be
thrown
open
to
all
comers
at
the
expense
it
was
not
without
considerable
demur
on
the
part
of
miss
winter
that
some
of
these
indiscriminate
festivities
were
allowed
to
pass
but
after
consulting
with
hardy
she
relented
on
condition
that
the
issue
of
beer
at
the
two
should
be
put
under
the
control
of
david
the
constable
who
on
his
part
promised
that
law
and
order
should
be
well
represented
and
maintained
on
the
occasion
arter
all
miss
you
sees
is
only
for
once
in
a
waay
he
said
and
make
remember
aal
as
hev
bin
said
to
about
the
indians
and
the
rest
o
so
the
captain
and
his
abettors
having
gained
the
constable
as
an
ally
prevailed
and
englebourn
much
wondering
at
itself
made
ready
for
a
general
holiday
chapter
xlvii
the
the
belfry
tower
rocked
and
reeled
as
that
peal
rang
out
now
merry
now
scornful
now
plaintive
from
whose
narrow
belfry
windows
into
the
bosom
of
the
soft
wind
which
was
playing
round
the
old
grey
tower
of
englebourn
church
and
the
wind
caught
the
peal
and
played
with
it
and
bore
it
away
over
rectory
and
village
street
and
many
a
homestead
and
gently
waving
field
of
ripening
corn
and
rich
pasture
and
and
tall
whispering
woods
of
the
grange
and
rolled
it
against
the
and
up
the
slope
past
the
clump
of
firs
on
the
hawk
lynch
till
it
died
away
on
the
wild
stretches
of
common
beyond
the
ringers
bent
lustily
to
their
work
there
had
been
no
such
ringing
in
englebourn
since
the
end
of
the
great
war
not
content
with
the
usual
peal
out
of
church
they
came
back
again
and
again
in
the
afternoon
full
of
the
good
cheer
which
had
been
provided
for
them
and
again
and
again
the
wedding
peal
rang
out
from
the
belfry
in
honour
of
their
old
comrade
such
was
the
ungallant
speech
which
for
many
generations
had
been
attributed
to
the
englebourn
when
you
had
once
caught
the
words
as
you
would
be
sure
to
do
from
some
grinning
boy
lounging
over
the
churchyard
rails
to
see
the
wedding
pass
it
would
be
impossible
to
persuade
yourself
that
they
did
in
fact
say
anything
else
somehow
harry
winburn
bore
his
undoing
in
the
most
heroic
manner
and
did
his
duty
throughout
the
trying
day
as
a
groom
should
the
only
part
of
the
performance
arranged
by
his
captain
which
he
fairly
resisted
was
the
proposed
departure
of
himself
and
patty
to
the
solitary
of
englebourn
a
real
old
yellow
with
a
pair
of
horses
east
after
hearing
the
pleading
on
the
subject
of
vehicles
at
last
allowed
them
to
drive
off
in
a
taking
a
small
boy
with
them
behind
to
bring
it
back
as
for
the
festivities
they
went
off
without
hitch
as
such
affairs
will
where
the
leaders
of
the
revels
have
their
hearts
in
them
the
children
had
all
played
and
romped
and
eaten
and
drunk
themselves
into
a
state
of
torpor
by
an
early
hour
of
the
evening
the
farmers
dinner
was
a
decided
success
east
proposed
the
health
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
was
followed
by
farmer
grove
and
the
constable
david
turned
out
in
a
new
blue
coat
with
metal
buttons
of
his
own
fabulous
cut
in
honor
of
the
occasion
he
and
the
farmer
spoke
like
the
leader
of
the
government
and
the
opposition
in
the
house
of
commons
on
an
address
to
the
crown
there
was
not
a
pin
to
choose
between
their
speeches
and
a
stranger
hearing
them
would
naturally
have
concluded
that
harry
had
never
been
anything
but
the
model
boy
and
young
man
of
the
parish
fortunately
the
oratorical
powers
of
englebourn
ended
here
and
east
and
the
majority
of
his
guests
adjourned
to
the
green
where
the
cricket
was
in
progress
each
game
lasted
a
very
short
time
only
as
the
youth
of
englebourn
were
not
experts
in
the
noble
science
and
lost
their
wickets
one
after
another
so
fast
that
tom
and
hardy
had
time
to
play
out
two
matches
with
them
and
then
to
retire
on
their
laurels
while
the
afternoon
was
yet
young
the
old
folks
in
the
village
enjoyed
their
beef
and
pudding
under
the
special
superintendence
of
miss
winter
and
then
toddled
to
their
homes
and
sat
about
in
the
warmest
nooks
they
could
find
mumbling
of
old
times
and
the
doings
at
winter
wedding
david
devoted
himself
to
superintending
the
issue
of
beer
swelling
with
importance
but
so
full
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
from
the
great
event
of
the
day
that
nobody
minded
his
little
airs
he
did
his
duty
so
satisfactorily
that
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
regular
confirmed
soakers
who
stuck
steadily
to
the
tap
of
the
red
lion
and
there
managed
successfully
to
fuddle
themselves
there
was
nothing
like
drunkenness
in
short
it
was
one
of
those
rare
days
when
everything
goes
right
and
everybody
seems
to
be
inclined
to
give
and
take
and
to
make
allowances
for
their
neighbours
by
degrees
the
cricket
flagged
and
most
of
the
men
went
off
to
sit
over
their
pipes
and
finish
the
evening
in
their
own
way
the
boys
and
girls
took
to
playing
at
kissing
in
the
ring
and
the
children
who
had
not
already
gone
home
sat
in
groups
watching
them
miss
winter
had
already
disappeared
and
tom
hardy
and
the
captain
began
to
feel
that
they
might
consider
their
part
finished
they
strolled
together
off
the
green
towards
lodgings
the
red
lion
being
still
in
possession
of
guests
well
how
do
you
think
it
all
went
off
asked
he
nothing
could
have
been
better
said
hardy
and
they
all
seem
so
inclined
to
be
reasonable
that
i
do
think
we
shall
even
have
a
roaring
song
along
the
street
when
the
red
lion
shuts
up
and
you
are
satisfied
tom
i
should
think
so
i
have
been
hoping
for
this
day
any
time
this
four
years
and
now
it
has
come
and
gone
off
well
too
thanks
to
you
harry
thanks
to
me
very
good
i
am
open
to
any
amount
of
gratitude
i
think
you
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
your
second
day
work
at
englebourn
at
any
rate
so
i
am
i
only
hope
it
may
turn
out
as
well
as
the
first
oh
there
no
doubt
about
that
i
do
know
i
rather
believe
in
the
rule
of
contraries
how
do
you
mean
why
when
you
inveigled
me
over
from
oxford
and
we
carried
off
the
sergeant
from
the
authorities
and
defeated
the
yeomanry
in
that
tremendous
i
thought
we
were
a
couple
of
idiots
and
deserved
a
week
each
in
the
lockup
for
our
pains
that
business
turned
out
well
this
time
we
have
started
with
flying
colours
and
bells
ringing
and
so
this
business
will
turn
out
better
why
not
then
let
us
manage
a
third
day
work
in
these
parts
as
soon
as
possible
i
should
like
to
get
to
the
third
degree
of
comparison
and
perhaps
the
superlative
will
turn
up
trumps
for
me
somehow
are
there
many
more
young
women
in
the
place
as
pretty
as
winburn
this
marrying
complaint
is
very
catching
i
find
there
my
cousin
katie
said
tom
looking
stealthily
at
hardy
i
wo
allow
that
there
any
face
in
the
to
match
hers
what
do
you
say
jack
hardy
was
confused
by
this
sudden
appeal
i
have
been
long
enough
here
to
judge
he
said
i
have
always
considered
miss
winter
very
beautiful
i
see
it
is
nearly
seven
and
i
have
a
call
or
two
to
make
in
the
village
i
should
think
you
ought
to
get
some
rest
after
this
tiring
day
captain
east
what
are
you
going
to
do
tom
well
i
was
thinking
of
just
throwing
a
fly
over
the
mill
tail
there
such
a
fine
head
of
water
on
is
it
too
bright
well
perhaps
it
is
a
little
marrying
weather
and
fishing
weather
do
agree
only
what
else
is
there
to
do
but
if
you
are
tired
he
added
looking
at
east
i
do
care
a
straw
about
it
i
shall
stay
with
you
not
a
bit
of
it
i
shall
hobble
down
with
you
and
lie
on
the
bank
and
smoke
a
cheroot
no
you
sha
walk
at
any
rate
i
can
borrow
the
pony
old
nibble
the
quietest
beast
in
the
world
he
stand
for
a
week
if
we
like
while
i
fish
and
you
lie
and
look
on
be
off
and
bring
him
around
in
two
minutes
then
we
shall
meet
for
a
clumsy
tea
at
nine
at
my
lodgings
said
hardy
as
he
went
off
to
his
pastoral
duties
tom
and
east
in
due
time
found
themselves
by
the
side
of
the
stream
there
was
only
a
small
piece
of
fishable
water
in
englebourn
the
fine
stream
which
a
mile
or
so
below
in
the
grange
grounds
might
be
called
a
river
came
into
respectable
existence
only
about
two
hundred
yards
above
englebourn
mill
here
two
little
chalk
brooks
met
and
former
millers
had
judiciously
deepened
the
channel
and
dammed
the
united
waters
back
so
as
to
get
a
respectable
reservoir
above
the
junction
the
little
weedy
bright
creeping
brooks
afforded
good
sport
for
small
truants
groppling
about
with
their
hands
or
bobbing
with
lob
worms
under
the
hollow
banks
but
were
not
available
for
the
scientific
angler
the
parish
ended
at
the
fence
next
below
the
mill
garden
on
the
other
side
of
which
the
land
was
part
of
the
grange
estate
so
there
was
just
the
piece
of
still
water
above
the
mill
and
the
one
field
below
it
over
which
tom
had
leave
on
ordinary
occasions
this
would
have
been
enough
with
careful
fishing
to
last
him
till
dark
but
his
nerves
were
probably
somewhat
excited
by
the
events
of
the
day
and
east
sat
near
and
kept
talking
so
he
got
over
his
water
faster
than
usual
at
any
rate
he
had
arrived
for
the
second
time
at
the
envious
fence
before
the
sun
was
down
the
fish
were
wondrous
wary
in
the
miller
bit
of
water
as
might
be
expected
for
they
led
a
dog
of
a
life
there
between
the
miller
and
his
men
and
their
nets
and
baits
of
all
kinds
always
set
so
tom
thought
himself
lucky
to
get
a
couple
of
decent
fish
the
only
ones
that
were
moving
within
his
liberty
but
he
could
not
help
looking
with
covetous
eyes
on
the
fine
stretch
of
water
below
all
dimpling
with
rises
why
do
you
get
over
and
fish
below
said
east
from
his
seat
on
the
bank
do
mind
me
i
can
watch
you
besides
lying
on
the
turf
on
such
an
evening
is
luxury
enough
by
itself
i
ca
go
both
sides
below
belong
to
that
fellow
wurley
the
sergeant
amiable
landlord
and
prosecutor
yes
and
the
yeoman
with
whom
you
exchanged
shots
on
the
common
hang
it
tom
just
jump
over
and
catch
a
brace
of
his
trout
look
how
they
are
rising
no
i
do
know
i
never
was
very
particular
about
poaching
but
somehow
i
should
like
to
do
it
on
his
land
i
do
like
him
well
enough
you
right
i
believe
but
just
look
there
there
a
whopper
rising
not
more
than
ten
yards
below
the
rail
you
might
reach
him
i
think
without
trespassing
from
where
you
stand
shall
i
have
a
shy
at
him
yes
it
ca
be
poaching
if
you
do
go
on
his
grounds
tom
could
not
resist
the
temptation
and
threw
over
the
rails
which
crossed
the
stream
from
hedge
to
hedge
to
mark
the
boundaries
of
the
parish
until
he
got
well
over
the
place
where
the
fish
was
rising
there
that
was
at
your
fly
said
east
hobbling
up
in
great
excitement
all
right
i
shall
have
him
directly
there
he
is
hullo
harry
i
say
splash
with
your
stick
drive
the
brute
back
bad
luck
to
him
look
at
that
the
fish
when
hooked
had
come
straight
up
stream
towards
his
captor
and
notwithstanding
east
attempts
to
frighten
him
back
he
rushed
in
under
the
walls
which
were
adorned
with
jagged
nails
to
make
crossing
on
them
unpleasant
for
the
englebourn
boys
against
one
of
these
tom
line
severed
and
the
waters
closed
over
two
beauteous
flies
and
some
six
feet
of
lovely
taper
gut
east
laughed
loud
and
merrily
and
tom
crestfallen
as
he
was
was
delighted
to
hear
the
old
ring
coming
back
into
his
voice
harry
old
fellow
you
picking
up
already
in
this
glorious
air
of
course
i
am
two
or
three
more
weddings
and
fishings
will
set
me
up
altogether
how
could
you
be
so
green
as
to
throw
over
those
rails
it
a
proper
lesson
to
you
tom
for
poaching
well
that
cool
did
i
throw
down
stream
to
please
you
you
ought
to
have
resisted
temptation
but
i
say
what
are
you
at
putting
on
another
cast
of
course
why
you
not
going
on
to
wurley
land
no
i
suppose
not
i
must
try
the
mill
tail
again
it
no
good
you
tried
it
over
twice
and
i
getting
bored
well
what
shall
we
do
then
i
a
mind
to
get
up
to
the
hill
there
to
see
the
sun
set
what
its
name
where
i
waited
with
the
cavalry
that
night
you
know
oh
the
hawk
lynch
come
along
then
i
your
man
so
tom
put
up
his
rod
and
caught
the
old
pony
and
the
two
friends
were
soon
on
their
way
towards
the
common
through
lanes
at
the
back
of
the
village
the
wind
had
sunk
to
sleep
as
the
shadows
lengthened
there
was
no
sound
abroad
except
that
of
nibble
hoofs
on
the
turf
not
even
the
hum
of
insects
for
the
few
persevering
gnats
who
were
still
dancing
about
in
the
slanting
glints
of
sunshine
that
struck
here
and
there
across
the
lanes
had
left
off
humming
nothing
living
met
them
except
an
occasional
steering
clumsily
down
the
lane
and
seeming
like
a
heavy
coaster
to
have
as
much
to
do
as
he
could
fairly
manage
in
keeping
clear
of
them
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
time
which
was
broken
at
last
by
east
i
have
had
time
to
tell
you
about
my
future
prospects
how
do
you
mean
has
anything
happened
yes
i
got
a
letter
two
days
ago
from
new
zealand
where
i
find
i
am
a
considerable
landowner
a
cousin
of
mine
has
died
out
there
and
has
left
me
his
property
w
ell
you
not
going
to
leave
england
surely
yes
i
am
the
doctors
say
the
voyage
will
do
me
good
and
the
climate
is
just
the
one
to
suit
me
what
the
good
of
my
staying
here
i
sha
be
fit
for
service
again
for
years
i
shall
go
on
and
become
an
enterprising
agriculturist
at
the
antipodes
i
have
spoken
to
the
sergeant
and
arranged
that
he
and
his
wife
shall
go
with
me
so
as
soon
as
i
can
get
his
discharge
and
he
has
done
honeymooning
we
shall
start
i
wish
you
would
come
with
us
tom
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
but
soon
found
that
east
was
in
earnest
and
had
an
answer
to
all
his
remonstrances
indeed
he
had
very
little
to
say
against
the
plan
for
it
jumped
with
his
own
humour
and
he
could
not
help
admitting
that
under
the
circumstances
it
was
a
wise
one
and
that
with
harry
winburn
for
his
head
man
east
could
do
better
than
carry
it
out
i
knew
you
would
soon
come
around
to
it
said
the
captain
what
could
i
do
dawdling
about
at
home
with
just
enough
money
to
keep
me
and
get
me
into
mischief
there
i
shall
have
a
position
and
an
object
and
one
may
be
of
some
use
and
make
one
mark
in
a
new
country
and
we
get
a
snug
berth
ready
for
you
by
the
time
you
starved
out
of
the
old
country
england
is
the
place
for
poor
men
with
any
go
in
them
i
believe
you
right
harry
said
tom
mournfully
i
know
i
am
and
in
a
few
years
when
we
made
our
fortunes
we
come
back
and
have
a
look
at
the
old
country
and
perhaps
buy
up
half
englebourn
and
lay
our
bones
in
the
old
church
yard
and
if
we
do
make
our
fortunes
then
we
stay
out
there
well
if
i
were
my
own
master
i
think
i
should
make
one
with
you
but
i
could
never
leave
my
father
and
mother
or
or
oh
i
understand
of
course
if
matters
go
all
right
in
that
quarter
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
but
from
what
you
have
told
me
i
thought
you
might
be
glad
of
a
regular
break
in
your
life
a
new
start
in
a
new
world
very
likely
i
may
i
should
have
said
so
myself
this
morning
but
somehow
i
feel
more
hopeful
than
i
have
for
years
those
wedding
chimes
are
running
in
your
head
yes
and
they
have
lifted
a
load
off
my
heart
too
four
years
ago
i
was
very
near
doing
the
greatest
wrong
a
man
can
do
to
that
girl
who
was
married
and
to
that
fine
fellow
her
husband
who
was
the
first
friend
i
ever
had
ever
since
then
i
have
been
doing
my
best
to
set
matters
straight
and
have
often
made
them
crookeder
but
they
are
all
straight
thank
god
and
i
feel
as
if
a
chain
were
broken
from
off
my
neck
all
has
come
right
for
them
and
perhaps
my
own
time
will
come
before
long
to
be
sure
it
will
i
must
be
introduced
to
a
certain
young
lady
before
we
start
i
shall
tell
her
that
i
do
mean
to
give
up
hopes
of
seeing
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
well
here
we
are
on
the
common
what
a
glorious
sunset
come
stir
up
nibble
we
shall
be
on
the
lynch
just
in
time
to
see
him
dip
if
we
push
on
nibble
the
ancient
pony
finding
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
scrambled
up
the
greater
part
of
the
ascent
successfully
but
his
wheezings
and
roarings
during
the
operation
excited
east
pity
so
he
dismounted
when
they
came
to
the
foot
of
the
hawk
lynch
and
tying
nibble
bridle
to
a
a
most
unnecessary
precaution
set
to
work
to
scale
the
last
and
deepest
bit
of
the
ascent
with
the
help
of
his
stick
and
tom
they
paused
every
ten
paces
or
so
to
rest
and
look
at
the
sunset
the
broad
vale
below
lay
in
purple
shadow
the
soft
flocks
of
little
clouds
high
up
over
their
heads
and
stretching
away
to
the
eastern
horizon
floated
in
a
sea
of
rosy
light
and
the
stems
of
the
scotch
firs
stood
out
like
columns
of
ruddy
flame
why
this
beats
india
said
east
putting
up
his
hand
to
shade
his
eyes
which
were
fairly
dazzled
by
the
blaze
what
a
contrast
to
the
last
time
i
was
up
here
do
you
remember
that
awful
sky
do
i
like
a
hullo
who
here
why
if
it
is
the
parson
and
miss
winter
said
east
smiling
true
enough
there
they
were
standing
together
on
the
very
verge
of
the
mound
beyond
the
firs
some
ten
yards
in
front
of
the
last
comers
looking
out
into
the
sunset
i
say
tom
another
good
omen
whispered
east
had
we
better
beat
a
retreat
before
tom
could
answer
or
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
hardy
turned
his
head
and
caught
sight
of
them
and
then
katie
turned
too
blushing
like
the
little
clouds
overhead
it
was
an
embarrassing
moment
tom
stammered
out
that
they
had
come
up
quite
by
chance
and
then
set
to
work
well
seconded
by
east
to
look
desperately
unconscious
and
to
expatiate
on
the
beauties
of
the
view
the
light
began
to
fade
and
the
little
clouds
to
change
again
from
soft
pink
to
grey
and
the
evening
star
shone
out
clear
as
they
turned
to
descend
the
hill
when
the
englebourn
clock
chimed
nine
katie
attached
herself
to
tom
while
hardy
helped
the
captain
down
the
steep
pitch
and
on
to
the
back
of
nibble
they
went
a
little
ahead
tom
was
longing
to
speak
to
his
cousin
but
could
not
tell
how
to
begin
at
last
katie
broke
the
silence
i
am
so
vexed
that
this
should
have
happened
are
you
dear
so
am
not
i
he
said
pressing
her
arm
to
his
side
but
i
mean
it
seems
so
forward
as
if
i
had
met
hardy
here
on
purpose
what
will
your
friend
think
of
me
he
will
think
no
evil
but
indeed
tom
do
tell
him
pray
it
was
quite
an
accident
you
know
how
i
and
mary
used
to
go
up
the
hawk
lynch
whenever
we
could
on
fine
evenings
yes
dear
i
know
it
well
and
i
thought
of
you
both
so
much
that
i
could
help
coming
up
here
and
you
found
hardy
i
do
wonder
i
should
come
up
to
see
the
sun
set
every
night
if
i
lived
at
englebourn
no
he
came
up
sometime
after
me
straight
up
the
hill
i
did
not
see
him
till
he
was
quite
close
i
could
not
run
away
then
indeed
it
was
not
five
minutes

chapter
xlviii
the
beginning
of
the
end
from
the
englebourn
festivities
tom
and
east
returned
to
london
the
captain
was
bent
on
starting
for
his
possessions
in
the
south
pacific
and
as
he
regained
strength
energized
over
all
his
preparations
and
went
about
in
cabs
purchasing
agricultural
implements
sometimes
by
the
light
of
nature
and
sometimes
under
the
guidance
of
harry
winburn
he
invested
also
in
something
of
a
library
and
in
large
quantities
of
saddlery
in
short
packages
of
all
kinds
began
to
increase
and
multiply
upon
him
then
there
was
the
selecting
of
a
vessel
and
all
the
negotiations
with
the
ship
captain
as
to
terms
and
the
business
of
getting
introduced
to
and
conferring
with
people
from
the
colony
or
who
were
supposed
to
know
something
about
it
altogether
east
had
plenty
of
work
on
his
hands
and
the
more
he
had
to
do
the
better
and
more
cheery
he
became
tom
on
the
contrary
was
rather
lower
than
usual
his
hopes
that
some
good
luck
was
going
to
happen
to
him
after
patty
marriage
were
beginning
to
grow
faint
and
the
contrast
of
his
friend
definite
present
purpose
in
life
with
his
own
uncertainty
made
him
more
or
less
melancholy
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
his
father
had
offered
him
a
tour
abroad
now
that
he
had
finished
with
oxford
urging
that
he
seemed
to
want
a
change
to
freshen
him
up
before
buckling
to
a
profession
and
that
he
would
never
in
all
likelihood
have
such
another
chance
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
accept
the
offer
the
attraction
to
london
was
too
strong
for
him
and
though
he
saw
little
hope
of
anything
happening
to
improve
his
prospects
he
could
not
keep
away
from
it
he
spent
most
of
his
time
when
not
with
east
in
haunting
the
neighborhood
of
porter
house
in
belgravia
and
the
places
where
he
was
likely
to
catch
distant
glimpses
of
mary
avoiding
all
chance
of
actual
meeting
or
recognition
from
which
he
shrank
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
the
nearest
approach
to
the
flame
which
he
allowed
himself
was
a
renewal
of
his
old
friendship
with
grey
who
was
still
working
on
in
his
westminister
rookery
he
had
become
a
great
favorite
with
porter
who
was
always
trying
to
get
him
to
her
house
to
feed
him
properly
and
was
much
astonished
and
sometimes
almost
provoked
at
the
small
success
of
her
hospitable
endeavors
grey
was
so
taken
up
with
his
own
pursuits
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
be
surprised
that
he
never
met
tom
at
the
house
of
his
relations
he
was
innocent
of
all
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
the
real
state
of
things
so
that
tom
could
talk
to
him
with
perfect
freedom
about
his
uncle
household
picking
up
all
such
scraps
of
information
as
grey
possessed
without
compromising
himself
or
feeling
shy
thus
the
two
old
schoolfellows
lived
on
together
after
their
return
from
englebourn
in
a
set
of
chambers
in
the
temple
which
one
of
tom
college
friends
who
had
been
beguiled
from
the
perusal
of
stephen
commentaries
and
aspirations
after
the
woolsack
by
the
offer
of
a
place
on
board
a
yacht
and
a
cruise
to
norway
had
fortunately
lent
him
we
join
company
with
our
hero
again
on
a
fine
july
morning
readers
will
begin
to
think
that
at
any
rate
he
is
always
blessed
with
fine
weather
whatever
troubles
he
may
have
to
endure
but
if
we
are
not
to
have
fine
weather
in
novels
when
and
where
are
we
to
have
it
it
was
a
fine
july
morning
then
and
the
streets
were
already
beginning
to
feel
sultry
as
he
worked
his
way
westward
grey
who
had
never
given
up
hopes
of
bringing
tom
round
to
his
own
views
had
not
neglected
the
opportunities
which
this
residence
in
town
offered
and
had
enlisted
tom
services
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
had
found
him
specially
useful
in
instructing
the
big
boys
whom
he
was
trying
to
bring
together
and
civilize
in
a
young
men
club
in
the
rudiments
of
cricket
on
saturday
evenings
but
on
the
morning
in
question
an
altogether
different
work
was
on
hand
a
lady
living
some
eight
or
nine
miles
to
the
of
london
who
took
great
interest
in
grey
doings
had
asked
him
to
bring
the
children
of
his
down
to
spend
a
day
in
her
grounds
and
this
was
the
happy
occasion
it
was
before
the
days
of
cheap
excursions
by
rail
so
that
vans
had
to
be
found
for
the
party
and
grey
had
discovered
a
benevolent
remover
of
furniture
in
paddington
who
was
ready
to
take
them
at
a
reasonable
figure
the
two
vans
with
awnings
and
curtains
in
the
height
of
fashion
and
horses
with
tasselled
and
everything
handsome
about
them
were
already
drawn
up
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
excited
children
and
scarcely
less
excited
mothers
when
tom
arrived
grey
was
arranging
his
forces
and
labouring
to
reduce
the
irish
children
who
formed
almost
half
his
ragged
little
flock
into
something
like
order
before
starting
by
degrees
this
was
managed
and
tom
was
placed
in
command
of
the
rear
van
while
grey
reserved
the
leading
one
to
himself
the
children
were
divided
and
warned
not
to
lean
over
the
sides
and
fall
out
a
somewhat
superfluous
caution
as
most
of
them
though
unused
to
riding
in
any
legitimate
manner
were
pretty
well
used
to
balancing
themselves
behind
any
vehicle
which
offered
as
much
as
a
spike
to
sit
on
out
of
sight
of
the
driver
then
came
the
rush
into
the
vans
grey
and
tom
took
up
their
places
next
the
doors
as
conductors
and
the
procession
lumbered
off
with
great
success
and
much
shouting
from
treble
voices
tom
soon
found
that
he
had
plenty
of
work
on
his
hands
to
keep
the
peace
among
his
flock
the
irish
element
was
in
a
state
of
wild
effervescence
and
he
had
to
draft
them
down
to
his
own
end
leaving
the
foremost
cart
of
the
van
to
the
soberer
english
children
he
was
much
struck
by
the
contrast
of
the
whole
set
to
the
englebourn
school
children
whom
he
had
lately
seen
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
the
difficulty
with
them
had
been
to
draw
them
out
and
put
anything
like
life
into
them
here
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
suppress
the
superabundant
life
however
the
vans
held
on
their
way
and
got
safely
into
the
suburbs
and
so
at
last
to
an
occasional
hedge
and
a
suspicion
of
trees
and
green
fields
beyond
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
now
to
keep
the
boys
in
and
when
they
came
to
a
hill
where
the
horses
had
to
walk
he
yielded
to
their
entreaties
and
opening
the
door
let
them
out
insisting
only
that
the
girls
should
remain
seated
they
scattered
over
the
sides
of
the
roads
and
up
the
banks
now
chasing
pigs
and
fowls
up
to
the
very
doors
of
their
owners
now
gathering
the
commonest
roadside
weeds
and
running
up
to
show
them
to
him
and
ask
their
names
as
if
they
were
rare
treasures
the
ignorance
of
most
of
the
children
as
to
the
commonest
country
matters
astonished
him
one
small
boy
particularly
came
back
time
after
time
to
ask
him
with
solemn
face
please
sir
is
this
the
country
and
when
at
last
he
allowed
that
it
was
rejoined
then
please
where
are
the
nuts
the
clothing
of
most
of
the
irish
boys
began
to
tumble
to
pieces
in
an
alarming
manner
grey
had
insisted
on
their
being
made
tidy
for
the
occasion
but
the
tidiness
was
of
a
superficial
kind
the
hasty
stitching
soon
began
to
give
way
and
they
were
rushing
about
with
wild
locks
the
strips
of
what
once
might
have
been
nether
garments
hanging
about
their
legs
their
feet
and
heads
bare
the
shoes
which
their
mothers
had
borrowed
for
the
state
occasion
having
been
deposited
under
the
seat
of
the
van
so
when
the
procession
arrived
at
the
trim
of
their
hostess
and
his
charge
descended
and
fell
in
on
the
beautifully
clipped
turf
at
the
side
of
the
drive
tom
felt
some
of
the
sensations
of
falstaff
when
he
had
to
lead
his
ragged
regiment
through
coventry
streets
he
was
soon
at
his
ease
again
and
enjoyed
the
day
thoroughly
and
the
drive
home
but
as
they
drew
near
town
again
a
sense
of
discomfort
and
shyness
came
over
him
and
he
wished
the
journey
to
westminster
well
over
and
hoped
that
the
carman
would
have
the
sense
to
go
through
the
quiet
parts
of
the
town
he
was
much
disconcerted
consequently
when
the
vans
came
to
a
sudden
stop
opposite
one
of
the
park
entrances
in
the
bayswater
road
what
in
the
world
is
grey
about
he
thought
as
he
saw
him
get
out
and
all
the
children
after
him
so
he
got
out
himself
and
went
forward
to
get
an
explanation
oh
i
have
told
the
man
that
he
need
not
drive
us
round
to
westminster
he
is
close
at
home
here
and
his
horses
have
had
a
hard
day
so
we
can
just
get
out
and
walk
home
what
across
the
park
asked
tom
yes
it
will
amuse
the
children
you
know
but
they
tired
persisted
tom
come
now
it
all
nonsense
letting
the
fellow
off
he
bound
to
take
us
back
i
afraid
i
have
promised
him
said
grey
besides
the
children
all
think
it
a
treat
do
you
all
want
to
walk
across
the
park
he
went
on
turning
to
them
and
a
general
affirmative
chorus
was
the
answer
so
tom
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
shrug
his
shoulders
empty
his
own
van
and
follow
into
the
park
with
his
convoy
not
in
the
best
humor
with
grey
for
having
arranged
this
ending
to
their
excursion
they
might
have
got
over
a
third
of
the
distance
between
the
bayswater
road
and
the
serpentine
when
he
was
aware
of
a
small
thin
voice
addressing
him
oh
please
wo
you
carry
me
a
bit
i
so
tired
said
the
voice
he
turned
in
some
trepidation
to
look
for
the
speaker
and
found
her
to
be
a
sickly
undergrown
little
girl
of
ten
or
thereabouts
with
large
pleading
grey
eyes
very
shabbily
dressed
and
a
little
lame
he
had
remarked
her
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
not
for
any
beauty
or
grace
about
her
for
the
poor
child
had
none
but
for
her
transparent
confidence
and
trustfulness
after
dinner
as
they
had
been
all
sitting
on
the
grass
under
the
shade
of
a
great
elm
to
hear
grey
read
a
story
and
tom
had
been
sitting
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
with
his
back
against
the
trunk
she
had
come
up
and
sat
quietly
down
by
him
leaning
on
his
knee
then
he
had
seen
her
go
up
and
take
the
hand
of
the
lady
who
had
entertained
them
and
walk
along
by
her
talking
without
the
least
shyness
soon
afterwards
she
had
squeezed
into
the
swing
by
the
side
of
the
little
daughter
of
the
same
lady
who
after
looking
for
a
minute
at
her
shabby
little
sister
with
large
round
eyes
had
jumped
out
and
run
off
to
her
mother
evidently
in
a
state
of
childish
bewilderment
as
to
whether
it
was
not
wicked
for
a
child
to
wear
such
dirty
old
clothes
tom
had
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
saw
cinderella
settling
herself
comfortably
in
the
swing
in
the
place
of
the
ousted
princess
and
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
child
speculating
to
himself
as
to
how
she
could
have
been
brought
up
to
be
so
utterly
unconscious
of
differences
of
rank
and
dress
she
seems
really
to
treat
her
as
if
she
had
been
studying
the
he
thought
she
was
cut
down
through
all
without
knowing
it
i
wonder
if
she
had
a
chance
whether
she
would
go
and
sit
down
in
the
queen
lap
he
did
not
at
the
time
anticipate
that
she
would
put
his
own
to
so
severe
a
test
before
the
day
was
over
the
child
had
been
as
merry
and
active
as
any
of
the
rest
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
but
now
as
he
looked
down
in
answer
to
her
reiterated
plea
wo
you
carry
me
a
bit
i
so
tired
he
saw
that
she
could
scarcely
drag
one
foot
after
another
what
was
to
be
done
he
was
already
keenly
alive
to
the
discomfort
of
walking
across
hyde
park
in
a
procession
of
ragged
children
with
such
a
figure
of
fun
as
grey
at
their
head
looking
in
his
long
rusty
black
coat
as
if
he
had
come
fresh
out
of
noah
ark
he
did
care
about
it
so
much
while
they
were
on
the
turf
in
the
parts
and
would
meet
nobody
but
guards
and
and
and
mechanics
out
for
an
evening
stroll
but
the
drive
and
rotten
row
lay
before
them
and
must
be
crossed
it
was
just
the
most
crowded
time
of
the
day
he
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
once
or
twice
to
stop
grey
and
the
procession
and
propose
to
sit
down
for
or
so
and
let
the
children
play
by
which
time
the
world
would
be
going
home
to
dinner
but
there
was
no
play
left
in
the
children
and
he
had
resisted
the
temptation
meaning
when
they
came
to
the
most
crowded
part
to
look
unconscious
as
if
it
were
by
chance
that
he
had
got
into
such
company
and
had
in
fact
nothing
to
do
with
them
but
now
if
he
listened
to
the
child
plea
and
carried
her
all
hope
of
concealment
was
over
if
he
did
not
he
felt
that
there
would
be
no
greater
flunkey
in
the
park
that
evening
than
thomas
brown
the
enlightened
radical
and
philosopher
amongst
the
young
gentlemen
riders
in
rotten
row
or
the
powdered
footmen
lounging
behind
the
great
blaring
carriages
in
the
drive
so
he
looked
down
at
the
child
once
or
twice
in
a
state
of
puzzle
a
third
time
she
looked
up
with
her
great
eyes
and
said
oh
please
carry
me
a
bit
and
her
piteous
tired
face
turned
the
scale
if
she
were
lady
mary
or
lady
blanche
thought
he
i
should
pick
her
up
at
once
and
be
proud
of
the
burden
here
goes
and
he
took
her
up
in
his
arms
and
walked
on
desperate
and
reckless
notwithstanding
all
his
philosophy
he
felt
his
ears
tingling
and
his
face
getting
red
as
they
approached
the
drive
it
was
crowded
they
were
kept
standing
a
minute
or
two
at
the
crossing
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
abstract
himself
wholly
from
the
visible
world
and
retire
in
a
state
of
serene
contemplation
but
it
would
not
do
and
he
was
painfully
conscious
of
the
stare
of
eyes
of
well
dressed
men
leaning
over
the
rails
and
the
amused
look
of
delicate
ladies
lounging
in
open
carriages
and
surveying
him
and
grey
and
their
ragged
rout
through
glasses
at
last
they
scrambled
across
and
he
breathed
freely
for
a
minute
as
they
struggled
along
the
comparatively
quiet
path
leading
to
albert
gate
and
stopped
to
drink
at
the
fountain
then
came
rotten
row
and
another
pause
amongst
the
loungers
and
a
plunge
into
the
ride
where
he
was
nearly
run
down
by
two
men
whom
he
had
known
at
oxford
they
shouted
to
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
he
felt
the
hot
defiant
blood
rushing
through
his
veins
as
he
strode
across
without
heeding
they
passed
on
one
of
them
having
to
pull
his
horse
out
of
his
stride
to
avoid
him
did
they
recognize
him
he
felt
a
strange
mixture
of
utter
indifference
and
longing
to
strangle
them
the
worst
was
now
over
besides
he
was
getting
used
to
the
situation
and
his
good
sense
was
beginning
to
rally
so
he
marched
through
albert
gate
carrying
his
ragged
little
charge
who
prattled
away
to
him
without
a
pause
and
surrounded
by
the
rest
of
the
children
scarcely
caring
who
might
see
him
they
won
safely
through
the
omnibuses
and
carriages
on
the
kensington
road
and
so
into
belgravia
at
last
he
was
quite
at
his
ease
again
and
began
listening
to
what
the
child
was
saying
to
him
and
was
strolling
carelessly
along
when
once
more
at
one
of
the
crossings
he
was
startled
by
a
shout
from
some
riders
there
was
straw
laid
down
in
the
street
so
that
he
had
not
heard
them
as
they
cantered
round
the
corner
hurrying
home
to
dress
for
dinner
and
they
were
all
but
upon
him
and
had
to
rein
up
their
horses
sharply
the
party
consisted
of
a
lady
and
two
gentlemen
one
old
the
other
young
the
latter
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
and
with
the
supercilious
air
which
tom
hated
from
his
soul
the
shout
came
from
the
young
man
and
drew
tom
attention
to
him
first
all
the
devil
rushed
up
as
he
recognized
st
cloud
the
lady
horse
swerved
against
his
and
began
to
rear
he
put
his
hand
on
its
bridle
as
if
he
had
a
right
to
protect
her
another
glance
told
tom
that
the
lady
was
mary
and
the
old
gentleman
fussing
up
on
his
stout
cob
on
the
other
side
of
her
porter
they
all
knew
him
in
another
moment
he
stared
from
one
to
the
other
was
conscious
that
she
turned
her
horse
head
sharply
so
as
to
disengage
the
bridle
from
st
cloud
hand
and
of
his
insolent
stare
and
of
the
embarrassment
of
porter
and
then
setting
his
face
straight
before
him
he
passed
on
in
a
bewildered
dream
never
looking
back
till
they
were
out
of
sight
the
dream
gave
way
to
bitter
and
wild
thoughts
upon
which
it
will
do
none
of
us
any
good
to
dwell
he
put
down
the
little
girl
outside
the
schools
turning
abruptly
from
the
mother
a
poor
widow
in
scant
black
clothes
who
was
waiting
for
the
child
and
began
thanking
him
for
his
care
of
her
refused
grey
pressing
invitation
to
tea
and
set
his
face
eastward
bitterer
and
more
wild
and
more
scornful
grew
his
thoughts
as
he
strode
along
past
the
abbey
and
up
whitehall
and
away
down
the
strand
holding
on
over
the
crossings
without
paying
the
slightest
heed
to
vehicle
or
horse
or
man
incensed
coachmen
had
to
pull
up
with
a
jerk
to
avoid
running
over
him
and
more
than
one
sturdy
walker
turned
round
in
indignation
at
a
collision
which
they
felt
had
been
intended
or
at
least
which
there
had
been
no
effort
to
avoid
as
he
passed
under
the
window
of
the
banqueting
hall
and
by
the
place
in
charing
cross
where
the
pillory
used
to
stand
he
growled
to
himself
what
a
pity
it
was
that
the
times
for
cutting
off
heads
and
cropping
ears
had
gone
by
the
whole
of
the
dense
population
from
either
side
of
the
strand
seemed
to
have
crowded
out
into
that
thoroughfare
to
impede
his
march
and
aggravate
him
the
further
eastward
he
got
the
thicker
got
the
crowd
and
the
vans
the
omnibuses
the
cabs
seemed
to
multiply
and
get
noisier
not
an
altogether
pleasant
sight
to
a
man
in
the
most
christian
frame
of
mind
is
the
crowd
that
a
fine
summer
evening
fetches
out
into
the
roaring
strand
as
the
sun
fetches
out
flies
on
the
window
of
a
village
grocery
to
him
just
then
it
was
at
once
depressing
and
provoking
and
he
went
shouldering
his
way
towards
temple
bar
as
thoroughly
out
of
tune
as
he
had
been
for
many
a
long
day
as
he
passed
from
the
narrowest
part
of
the
strand
into
the
space
round
clement
danes
church
he
was
startled
in
a
momentary
lull
of
the
uproar
by
the
sound
of
chiming
bells
he
slackened
his
pace
to
listen
but
a
huge
van
lumbered
by
shaking
the
houses
on
both
sides
and
drowning
all
sounds
but
its
own
rattle
and
then
he
found
himself
suddenly
immersed
in
a
crowd
vociferating
and
gesticulating
round
a
policeman
who
was
conveying
a
woman
towards
the
he
shouldered
through
it
another
lull
came
and
with
it
the
same
slow
gentle
calm
cadence
of
chiming
bells
again
and
again
he
caught
it
as
he
passed
on
to
temple
bar
whenever
the
roar
subsided
the
notes
of
the
old
hymn
tune
came
dropping
down
on
him
like
balm
from
the
air
if
the
ancient
benefactor
who
caused
the
bells
of
clement
danes
church
to
be
arranged
to
play
that
chime
so
many
times
a
day
is
allowed
to
hover
round
the
steeple
at
such
times
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
benefaction
on
posterity
he
must
have
been
well
satisfied
on
that
evening
tom
passed
under
the
bar
and
turned
into
the
temple
another
man
softened
again
and
in
his
right
mind
there
always
a
voice
saying
the
right
thing
to
you
somewhere
if
you
only
listen
for
it
he
thought
he
took
a
few
turns
in
the
court
to
clear
his
head
and
then
found
harry
east
reclining
on
a
sofa
in
full
view
of
the
gardens
and
river
solacing
himself
with
his
accustomed
cheroot
oh
here
you
are
he
said
making
room
on
the
sofa
how
did
it
go
off
well
enough
where
have
you
been
in
the
city
and
at
the
docks
i
been
all
over
our
vessel
she
a
real
clipper
when
do
you
sail
not
quite
certain
i
should
say
in
a
fortnight
though
east
puffed
away
for
a
minute
and
then
as
tom
said
nothing
went
on
i
not
so
sweet
on
it
as
the
time
draws
near
there
are
more
of
my
chums
turning
up
every
day
from
india
at
the
rag
and
this
is
uncommonly
pleasant
too
living
with
you
here
in
the
chambers
you
may
probably
think
it
odd
but
i
do
half
like
getting
rid
of
you
thanks
but
i
do
think
you
will
get
rid
of
me
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
shall
go
with
you
if
my
people
will
let
me
and
you
will
take
me
anything
happened
yes
you
seen
her
yes
well
go
on
do
keep
a
fellow
in
suspense
i
shall
be
introduced
and
eat
one
of
the
old
boy
good
dinners
after
all
before
i
sail
tom
looked
out
of
window
and
found
some
difficulty
in
getting
out
the
words
no
it
all
up
you
do
mean
it
said
east
coming
to
a
sitting
position
by
tom
side
but
how
do
you
know
are
you
sure
what
did
she
say
nothing
i
have
spoken
to
her
but
it
all
up
she
was
riding
with
her
father
and
the
fellow
to
whom
she
engaged
i
have
heard
it
a
dozen
times
but
never
would
believe
it
but
is
that
all
riding
with
her
father
and
another
man
why
there
nothing
in
that
yes
but
there
is
though
you
should
have
seen
his
look
and
they
all
knew
me
well
enough
but
not
one
of
them
nodded
even
well
there
not
much
in
that
after
all
it
may
have
been
chance
or
you
may
have
fancied
it
no
one
is
quite
such
a
fool
however
i
have
no
right
to
complain
and
i
wo
i
could
bear
it
all
well
enough
if
he
were
not
such
a
blackguard
what
this
fellow
she
was
riding
with
yes
he
has
a
heart
the
size
of
a
pin
head
he
break
hers
he
a
mean
brute
too
she
ca
know
him
though
he
has
been
after
her
this
year
and
more
they
must
have
forced
her
into
it
ah
it
a
bitter
business
and
he
put
his
head
between
his
hands
and
east
heard
the
deep
catches
of
his
laboring
breath
as
he
sat
by
him
feeling
deeply
for
him
but
puzzled
what
to
say
she
ca
be
worth
so
much
after
all
tom
he
said
at
last
if
she
would
have
such
a
fellow
as
that
depend
upon
it
she
not
what
you
thought
her
tom
made
no
answer
so
the
captain
went
on
presently
thinking
he
had
hit
the
right
note
cheer
up
old
boy
there
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
yet
as
ever
came
out
of
it
do
you
remember
the
song
whose
is
it
lovelace
she
be
not
fair
for
me
what
care
i
for
whom
she
be
tom
started
up
almost
fiercely
but
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
and
then
leant
his
head
down
again
do
talk
about
her
harry
you
do
know
her
he
said
and
do
want
to
know
her
tom
if
she
is
going
to
throw
you
over
well
i
shall
leave
you
for
an
hour
or
so
come
up
to
me
presently
at
the
rag
when
you
feel
better
east
started
for
his
club
debating
within
himself
what
he
could
do
for
his
friend
whether
calling
out
the
party
might
do
good
tom
left
to
himself
broke
down
at
first
sadly
but
as
the
evening
wore
on
he
began
to
rally
and
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
father
making
a
clean
breast
and
asking
his
permission
to
go
with
east
chapter
xlix
the
end
my
dear
katie
i
know
you
will
be
very
much
pained
when
you
read
this
letter
you
two
have
been
my
only
confidantes
and
you
have
always
kept
me
up
and
encouraged
me
to
hope
that
all
would
come
right
and
after
all
that
happened
last
week
patty
marriage
and
your
engagement
the
two
things
upon
earth
with
one
exception
that
i
most
wished
for
i
quite
felt
that
my
own
turn
was
coming
i
ca
tell
why
i
had
such
a
strong
feeling
about
it
but
somehow
all
the
most
important
changes
in
my
life
for
the
last
four
years
have
been
so
interwoven
with
patty
and
harry
winburn
history
that
now
they
were
married
i
was
sure
something
would
happen
to
me
as
soon
as
i
came
to
london
and
i
was
not
wrong
dear
katie
i
can
hardly
bring
myself
to
write
it
it
is
all
over
i
met
her
in
the
street
she
was
riding
with
her
father
and
the
man
i
told
you
about
they
had
to
pull
up
not
to
ride
over
me
so
i
had
a
good
look
at
her
and
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
it
i
have
often
tried
to
reason
myself
into
the
belief
that
the
evil
day
must
come
sooner
or
later
and
to
prepare
myself
for
it
but
i
might
have
spared
myself
for
it
could
not
have
been
worse
than
it
is
if
i
had
never
anticipated
it
my
future
is
all
a
blank
now
i
ca
stay
in
england
so
i
have
written
home
to
ask
them
to
let
me
go
to
new
zealand
with
east
and
i
am
sure
they
will
consent
when
they
know
all
i
shall
wait
in
town
till
i
get
the
answer
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
get
off
with
east
in
a
few
weeks
the
sooner
the
better
but
of
course
i
shall
not
go
without
seeing
you
and
dear
old
jack
you
must
mind
me
calling
him
jack
the
only
thing
that
it
gives
me
any
pleasure
to
think
about
is
your
engagement
it
is
so
right
and
one
wants
to
see
something
going
right
some
one
getting
their
due
to
keep
alive
one
belief
in
justice
being
done
somehow
or
another
in
the
world
and
i
do
see
it
and
acknowledge
it
when
i
think
over
his
history
and
mine
since
we
first
met
we
have
both
got
our
due
and
you
have
got
yours
katie
for
you
have
got
the
best
fellow
in
england
ah
if
i
only
could
think
that
she
has
got
hers
if
i
could
only
believe
that
the
man
she
has
chosen
is
worthy
of
her
i
will
try
hard
to
think
better
of
him
there
must
be
more
good
in
him
that
i
have
ever
seen
or
she
would
never
have
engaged
herself
to
him
but
i
ca
bear
to
stop
here
and
see
it
all
going
on
the
sooner
i
am
out
of
england
the
better
i
send
you
a
parcel
with
this
it
contains
her
notes
and
some
old
flowers
and
other
matters
which
i
have
the
heart
to
burn
you
will
be
the
best
judge
what
should
be
done
with
them
if
you
see
your
way
to
managing
it
i
should
like
her
to
know
that
i
had
sent
them
all
to
you
and
that
whatever
may
happen
to
me
hereafter
my
love
for
her
has
been
the
mainstay
and
the
of
my
life
ever
since
that
happy
time
when
you
all
came
to
stay
with
us
in
my
first
long
vacation
it
found
me
eaten
up
with
selfishness
and
conceit
the
puppet
of
my
own
lusts
and
vanities
and
has
left
me
well
never
mind
what
it
has
left
me
at
any
rate
if
i
have
not
gone
from
worse
to
worse
it
is
all
owing
to
her
and
she
ought
to
know
it
it
can
not
be
wrong
to
let
her
know
what
good
she
has
scattered
unknowingly
about
her
path
may
god
bless
and
reward
her
for
it
and
you
too
dear
cousin
for
all
your
long
love
and
kindness
to
one
who
is
very
unworthy
of
but
very
thankful
for
them
ever
yours
affectionately
t
b
the
above
letter
and
that
to
his
father
asking
for
leave
to
emigrate
having
been
written
and
sent
off
tom
was
left
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
his
upset
making
manful
if
not
very
successful
efforts
to
shake
off
the
load
of
depression
which
weighed
on
him
and
to
turn
his
thoughts
resolutely
forward
to
a
new
life
in
a
new
country
east
was
away
at
the
docks
there
was
no
one
moving
in
the
temple
the
men
who
had
business
were
all
at
westminster
or
out
of
sight
and
hearing
in
the
recesses
of
their
chambers
those
who
had
none
were
for
the
most
part
away
enjoying
themselves
in
one
way
or
another
amongst
the
mighty
whirl
of
the
mighty
human
sea
of
london
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
he
had
written
the
only
two
letters
he
had
to
write
and
had
only
to
sit
still
and
wait
for
the
answers
killing
the
meantime
as
well
as
he
could
reading
came
hard
to
him
but
it
was
the
best
thing
to
do
perhaps
at
any
rate
he
was
trying
it
on
though
his
studies
were
constantly
interrupted
by
long
fits
of
absence
of
mind
during
which
though
his
body
remained
in
the
temple
he
was
again
in
the
garden
of
barton
or
in
the
hazel
wood
under
the
lee
of
the
berkshire
hills
he
was
roused
out
of
one
of
these
reveries
and
brought
back
to
external
life
and
court
by
a
single
knock
at
the
outer
door
and
a
shout
of
the
newsman
boy
for
the
paper
so
he
got
up
found
the
paper
which
he
had
forgotten
to
read
and
as
he
went
to
the
door
cast
his
eye
on
it
and
saw
that
a
great
match
was
going
on
at
lord
this
gave
a
new
turn
to
his
thoughts
he
stood
looking
down
stairs
after
the
boy
considering
whether
he
should
not
start
at
once
for
the
match
he
would
be
sure
to
see
a
lot
of
acquaintances
there
at
any
rate
but
the
idea
of
seeing
and
having
to
talk
to
mere
acquaintances
was
more
distasteful
than
his
present
solitude
he
was
turning
to
bury
himself
again
in
his
hole
when
he
saw
a
white
dog
walk
quietly
up
seven
or
eight
stairs
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
and
then
turn
round
and
look
for
some
one
to
follow
how
odd
thought
tom
as
he
watched
him
as
like
as
two
peas
it
ca
be
no
why
yes
it
is
and
then
he
whistled
and
called
jack
and
the
dog
looked
up
and
wagged
his
tail
as
much
as
to
say
all
right
i
coming
directly
but
i
must
wait
for
my
master
the
next
moment
drysdale
appeared
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
looking
up
said
oh
that
you
is
it
i
all
right
then
so
you
knew
the
old
dog
i
should
rather
think
so
said
tom
i
hope
i
never
forget
a
dog
or
horse
i
have
once
known
in
the
short
minute
which
drysdale
and
jack
took
to
arrive
at
his
landing
tom
had
time
for
a
rush
of
old
college
memories
in
which
the
grave
and
gay
pleasant
and
bitter
were
strangely
mingled
the
light
when
he
had
been
first
brought
to
his
senses
about
patty
came
up
very
vividly
before
him
and
the
commemoration
days
when
he
had
last
seen
drysdale
how
strange
he
thought
is
my
old
life
coming
back
again
just
now
here
on
the
very
day
after
it
is
all
over
comes
back
the
man
with
whom
i
was
so
intimate
up
to
the
day
it
began
and
have
never
seen
since
what
does
it
mean
there
was
a
little
touch
of
embarrassment
in
the
manner
of
both
of
them
as
they
shook
hands
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
turned
into
the
chambers
tom
motioned
to
jack
to
take
his
old
place
at
one
end
of
the
sofa
and
began
caressing
him
there
the
dog
showing
unmistakably
by
gesture
and
whine
that
delight
at
renewing
an
old
friendship
for
which
his
race
are
so
nobly
distinguished
drysdale
threw
himself
down
in
an
and
watched
them
so
you
knew
the
old
dog
brown
he
repeated
knew
him
of
course
i
did
dear
old
jack
how
well
he
wears
he
is
scarcely
altered
at
all
very
little
only
steadier
more
than
i
can
say
for
his
master
i
very
glad
you
knew
jack
come
drysdale
take
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
or
it
wo
look
like
old
times
there
now
i
can
fancy
myself
back
at
st
ambrose
by
jove
brown
you
a
real
good
fellow
i
always
said
so
even
after
that
last
letter
you
pitched
it
rather
strong
in
that
though
i
was
very
near
coming
back
from
norway
to
quarrel
with
you
well
i
was
very
angry
at
being
left
in
the
lurch
by
you
and
blake
you
got
the
coin
all
right
i
suppose
you
never
acknowledged
it
did
i
then
i
ought
to
have
yes
i
got
it
all
right
about
six
months
afterwards
i
ought
to
have
acknowledged
it
and
i
thought
i
had
i
sorry
i
did
now
we
all
quits
and
talk
any
more
about
that
rascally
bill
i
suppose
i
may
light
up
said
drysdale
dropping
into
his
old
lounging
attitude
on
the
sofa
and
pulling
out
his
yes
of
course
will
you
have
anything
a
cool
drink
would
be
amiss
they
make
a
nice
tankard
with
cider
and
a
lump
of
ice
at
the
what
do
you
say
to
that
it
sounds
touching
said
drysdale
so
tom
posted
off
to
fleet
street
to
order
the
liquor
and
came
back
followed
by
a
waiter
with
the
tankard
drysdale
took
a
long
pull
and
smacked
his
lips
that
a
wrinkle
he
said
handing
the
tankard
to
tom
i
suppose
the
lawyers
teach
all
the
publicans
about
here
a
trick
or
two
why
one
can
fancy
one
self
back
in
the
old
quad
looking
out
on
this
court
if
it
were
such
an
outlandish
place
i
think
i
should
take
some
chambers
here
myself
how
did
you
get
here
oh
they
belong
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
away
but
how
did
get
here
why
along
the
strand
in
a
hansom
i
mean
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
grey
told
me
what
grey
who
was
at
ambrose
with
us
yes
you
look
puzzled
i
did
think
you
knew
grey
no
more
i
do
but
a
stout
old
party
i
met
last
night
your
godfather
i
should
think
he
is
told
me
where
he
was
and
said
i
should
get
your
address
from
him
so
i
looked
him
up
this
morning
in
that
in
westminster
where
he
lives
he
did
know
jack
from
adam
but
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
by
my
godfather
i
had
better
tell
my
story
from
the
beginning
i
see
last
night
i
did
what
i
do
often
do
went
out
to
a
great
drum
there
was
an
awful
crush
of
course
and
you
may
guess
what
the
heat
was
in
these
with
and
going
and
a
jam
of
people
in
every
corner
i
was
fool
enough
to
get
into
the
rooms
so
that
my
retreat
was
cut
off
and
i
had
to
work
right
through
and
got
at
last
into
a
back
room
which
was
not
so
full
the
window
was
in
a
recess
and
there
was
a
balcony
outside
looking
over
a
little
bit
of
garden
i
got
into
the
balcony
talking
with
a
girl
who
was
sensible
enough
to
like
the
cool
presently
i
heard
a
voice
i
thought
i
knew
inside
then
i
heard
ambrose
and
then
your
name
of
course
i
listened
i
help
myself
they
were
just
inside
the
window
in
the
recess
not
five
feet
from
us
so
i
heard
pretty
nearly
ever
word
give
us
the
tankard
i
as
dry
as
an
with
talking
tom
scarcely
able
to
control
his
impatience
handed
the
tankard
but
who
was
it
you
have
told
me
he
said
as
drysdale
put
it
down
at
last
empty
why
that
d
d
st
cloud
he
was
giving
you
a
nice
character
in
a
sort
of
sneaking
deprecatory
way
as
if
he
was
sorry
for
it
amongst
other
little
tales
he
said
you
used
to
borrow
money
from
jews
he
knew
it
for
a
certainty
because
he
had
been
asked
himself
to
join
you
and
another
man
meaning
me
of
course
in
such
a
transaction
you
remember
how
he
would
acknowledge
the
money
i
lent
him
at
play
and
the
note
he
wrote
me
which
upset
blake
so
i
had
never
forgotten
it
i
knew
i
should
get
my
chance
some
day
and
here
it
was
i
do
know
what
the
girl
thought
of
me
or
how
she
got
out
of
the
balcony
but
i
stepped
into
the
recess
just
as
he
had
finished
his
precious
story
and
landed
between
him
and
a
comfortable
old
boy
who
was
looking
shocked
he
be
your
godfather
or
something
of
the
kind
i
bet
you
a
pony
you
are
down
for
something
handsome
in
his
will
what
was
his
name
did
you
find
out
yes
potter
or
porter
or
something
like
it
i
got
his
card
somewhere
i
just
stared
st
cloud
in
the
face
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
winched
then
i
told
the
old
boy
that
i
had
heard
their
talk
and
as
i
was
at
ambrose
with
you
i
should
like
to
have
five
minutes
with
him
when
st
cloud
had
done
he
seemed
rather
in
a
corner
between
us
however
i
kept
in
sight
till
st
cloud
was
obliged
to
draw
off
and
to
cut
my
story
short
as
the
tankard
is
empty
i
think
i
put
you
pretty
straight
there
you
said
we
were
quits
just
now
after
last
night
perhaps
we
are
for
i
told
him
the
truth
of
the
benjamin
story
and
i
think
he
is
squared
he
seems
a
good
sort
of
old
boy
he
a
relation
of
yours
eh
only
a
distant
connexion
did
anything
more
happen
yes
i
saw
that
he
was
flurried
and
did
know
quite
what
to
think
so
i
asked
him
to
let
me
call
and
i
would
bring
him
some
one
else
to
speak
to
your
character
he
gave
me
his
card
and
going
to
take
blake
there
today
then
i
asked
him
where
you
were
and
he
did
know
but
said
he
thought
grey
could
tell
me
it
is
very
kind
of
you
drysdale
to
take
so
much
trouble
trouble
i
go
from
here
to
jericho
to
be
even
with
our
fine
friend
i
never
forget
a
bad
turn
i
met
him
afterwards
in
the
and
went
out
of
the
door
close
after
him
to
give
him
a
chance
if
he
wants
to
say
anything
i
only
wish
he
would
but
why
do
you
suppose
he
is
lying
about
you
i
ca
tell
i
never
spoken
to
him
since
he
left
oxford
never
saw
him
till
yesterday
riding
with
porter
i
suppose
that
reminded
them
of
me
well
st
cloud
is
bent
on
getting
round
him
for
some
reason
or
another
you
may
take
your
oath
of
that
now
my
time
up
i
shall
go
and
pick
up
blake
i
should
think
i
had
better
not
take
jack
to
call
in
eaton
square
though
he
give
you
a
good
character
if
he
could
speak
would
you
jack
jack
wagged
his
tail
and
descended
from
the
sofa
does
blake
live
up
here
what
is
he
doing
burning
the
candle
at
both
ends
and
in
the
middle
as
usual
yes
he
living
near
his
club
he
writes
political
articles
devilish
well
i
hear
too
and
is
reading
for
the
bar
beside
which
he
is
getting
into
society
and
going
out
whenever
he
can
and
fretting
his
soul
out
that
he
is
prime
minister
or
something
of
the
kind
he
wo
last
long
at
the
pace
going
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
but
you
come
here
again
drysdale
or
let
me
come
and
see
you
i
shall
be
very
anxious
to
hear
what
has
happened
here
my
pasteboard
i
shall
be
in
town
for
another
fortnight
drop
in
when
you
like
and
so
drysdale
and
jack
went
off
leaving
tom
in
a
chaotic
state
of
mind
all
his
old
hopes
were
roused
again
as
he
thought
over
drysdale
narrative
he
could
no
longer
sit
still
so
he
rushed
out
and
walked
up
and
down
the
walk
in
the
temple
gardens
where
a
fine
breeze
blowing
at
a
pace
which
astonished
the
and
the
and
children
who
were
taking
the
air
in
that
favorite
spot
once
or
twice
he
returned
to
chambers
and
at
last
found
east
reposing
after
his
excursion
to
the
docks
east
quick
eye
saw
at
once
that
something
had
happened
and
he
had
very
soon
heard
the
whole
story
upon
which
he
deliberated
for
some
minutes
and
rejoiced
tom
heart
by
saying
ah
all
up
with
new
zealand
i
see
i
shall
be
introduced
after
all
before
we
start
come
along
i
must
stand
you
a
dinner
on
the
strength
of
the
good
news
and
we
drink
her
health
tom
called
twice
that
evening
at
drysdale
lodgings
but
he
was
out
the
next
morning
he
called
again
drysdale
had
gone
to
hampton
court
races
and
had
left
no
message
he
left
a
note
for
him
but
got
no
answer
it
was
trying
work
another
day
passed
without
any
word
from
drysdale
who
seemed
never
to
be
at
home
and
no
answer
to
either
of
his
letters
on
the
third
morning
he
heard
from
his
father
it
was
just
the
answer
which
he
had
expected
as
kind
a
letter
as
could
be
written
brown
had
suspected
how
matters
stood
at
one
time
but
had
given
up
the
idea
in
consequence
of
tom
silence
which
he
regretted
as
possibly
things
might
have
happened
otherwise
had
he
known
the
state
of
the
case
it
was
too
late
now
however
and
the
less
said
the
better
about
what
might
have
been
as
to
new
zealand
he
should
not
oppose
tom
going
if
after
some
time
he
continued
in
his
present
mind
it
was
very
natural
for
him
just
now
to
wish
to
go
they
would
talk
it
over
as
soon
as
tom
came
home
which
brown
begged
him
to
do
at
once
or
at
any
rate
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
his
friend
off
home
was
the
best
place
for
him
tom
sighed
as
he
folded
it
up
the
hopes
of
the
last
three
days
seemed
to
be
fading
away
again
he
spent
another
restless
day
and
by
night
had
persuaded
himself
that
drysdale
mission
had
been
a
complete
failure
and
that
he
did
not
write
and
kept
out
of
the
way
out
of
kindness
for
him
why
tom
old
fellow
you
look
as
down
in
the
mouth
as
ever
east
said
when
tom
opened
the
door
for
him
about
midnight
on
his
return
from
his
club
cheer
up
you
may
depend
it
all
to
go
right
but
i
have
seen
drysdale
again
and
he
has
written
to
me
there
nothing
in
that
he
was
glad
enough
to
do
you
a
good
turn
i
dare
say
when
it
came
in
his
way
but
that
sort
of
fellow
never
can
keep
anything
up
he
has
been
too
much
used
to
having
his
own
way
and
following
his
own
fancies
do
you
lose
heart
because
he
wo
put
himself
out
for
you
well
harry
you
are
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
you
would
put
a
backbone
into
anyone
now
we
just
have
a
quiet
cheroot
and
then
turn
in
and
see
if
you
do
have
good
news
how
hot
it
is
the
strand
is
as
hot
as
the
punjaub
and
the
reek
of
it
phah
my
throat
is
full
of
it
still
east
took
off
his
coat
and
was
just
throwing
it
on
a
chair
when
he
stopped
and
feeling
in
his
pocket
said
let
see
here
a
note
for
you
the
porter
gave
it
to
me
as
i
knocked
in
tom
took
it
carelessly
but
the
next
moment
was
tearing
it
open
with
trembling
fingers
from
my
cousin
he
said
east
watched
him
read
and
saw
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
and
the
light
come
into
his
eyes
good
news
tom
i
see
bravo
old
boy
you
had
a
long
fight
for
it
and
deserve
to
win
tom
got
up
tossed
the
note
across
the
table
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
his
heart
was
too
full
for
speech
may
i
read
said
east
looking
up
tom
nodded
and
he
read
dear
tom
i
am
coming
to
town
to
spend
a
week
with
them
in
eaton
square
call
on
me
at
twelve
or
if
you
are
engaged
then
between
three
and
five
i
have
no
time
to
add
more
now
but
long
to
see
you
your
loving
cousin
katie
i
will
give
you
your
parcel
back
and
then
you
can
the
contents
yourself
or
do
what
you
like
with
them
uncle
bids
me
say
he
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
come
and
dine
and
any
other
day
you
can
spare
while
i
am
here
when
he
had
read
the
note
east
got
up
and
shook
hands
heartily
with
tom
and
then
sat
down
again
quietly
to
finish
his
cheroot
watching
with
a
humorous
look
his
friend
march
and
you
think
it
is
really
all
right
now
tom
asked
in
one
form
or
another
after
every
few
turns
and
east
replied
in
various
forms
of
chaffing
assurance
that
there
could
not
be
much
further
question
on
the
point
at
last
when
he
had
finished
his
cheroot
he
got
up
and
taking
his
candle
said
good
night
tom
when
that
revolution
comes
which
you
always
predicting
remember
if
you
not
shot
or
hung
you
always
find
a
roost
for
you
and
your
wife
in
new
zealand
i
do
feel
so
sure
about
the
revolution
now
harry
of
course
you
do
mind
i
bargain
for
the
dinner
in
eaton
square
i
always
told
you
i
should
dine
there
before
i
started
the
next
day
tom
found
that
he
was
not
engaged
at
twelve
and
was
able
to
appear
in
eaton
square
he
was
shown
up
into
the
and
found
katie
alone
there
the
quiet
and
coolness
of
the
darkened
room
was
most
grateful
to
him
after
the
glare
of
the
streets
as
he
sat
down
by
her
side
but
katie
he
said
as
soon
as
the
first
salutations
and
congratulations
had
passed
how
did
it
all
happen
i
believe
my
senses
yet
i
am
afraid
i
may
wake
up
any
minute
well
it
was
chiefly
owing
to
two
lucky
coincidences
though
no
doubt
it
would
have
all
come
right
in
time
without
them
our
meeting
the
other
day
in
the
street
i
suppose
was
one
of
them
yes
coming
across
you
so
suddenly
carrying
the
little
girl
reminded
mary
of
the
day
when
she
sprained
her
ankle
and
you
carried
her
through
hazel
copse
ah
you
never
told
me
of
that
adventure
either
of
you
all
that
was
necessary
katie
oh
i
have
pardoned
you
uncle
saw
then
that
she
was
very
much
moved
at
something
and
guessed
well
enough
what
it
was
he
is
so
very
kind
and
so
fond
of
mary
he
would
do
anything
in
the
world
that
she
wished
she
was
quite
unwell
that
evening
so
he
and
aunt
had
to
go
out
alone
and
they
met
st
cloud
at
a
party
who
was
said
to
be
engaged
to
her
it
was
true
then
no
never
he
is
a
very
designing
man
though
i
believe
he
was
really
in
love
with
poor
mary
at
any
rate
he
has
persecuted
her
for
more
than
a
year
and
it
is
very
wicked
but
i
am
afraid
he
spread
all
those
reports
himself
of
their
engagement
just
like
him
uncle
is
so
you
know
and
he
took
advantage
of
it
and
was
always
coming
here
and
riding
with
them
and
he
made
uncle
believe
dreadful
stories
about
you
which
made
him
seem
so
unkind
he
was
quite
afraid
to
have
you
at
the
house
yes
i
saw
that
last
year
and
the
second
coincidence
it
happened
that
very
night
poor
uncle
was
very
much
troubled
what
to
do
so
when
he
met
st
cloud
as
i
told
you
he
took
him
aside
to
ask
him
again
about
you
somehow
a
gentleman
who
was
a
friend
of
yours
at
oxford
overheard
what
was
said
and
came
forward
and
explained
everything
yes
he
came
and
told
me
then
you
know
more
than
i
about
it
and
you
think
porter
is
convinced
that
i
am
not
quite
such
a
scamp
after
all
yes
indeed
and
the
boys
are
so
delighted
that
they
will
see
you
again
they
are
at
home
for
the
holidays
and
so
grown
and
mary
she
is
very
well
you
will
see
her
before
long
i
dare
say
is
she
at
home
she
is
out
riding
with
uncle
now
i
will
go
up
and
get
your
parcel
which
i
had
opened
at
home
before
i
got
aunt
note
asking
me
here
no
wonder
we
could
never
find
her
boot
katie
disappeared
and
at
the
same
time
tom
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
horses
feet
yes
and
they
had
stopped
too
it
must
be
mary
and
her
father
he
could
not
see
because
of
the
blinds
and
other
devices
for
keeping
the
room
cool
but
the
next
moment
there
were
voices
in
the
hall
below
and
then
a
light
step
on
the
carpeted
stair
which
no
ear
but
his
could
have
heard
his
heart
beat
with
heavy
painful
pulsations
and
his
head
swam
as
the
door
opened
and
mary
in
her
stood
in
the
room
chapter
l
the
postscript
our
curtain
must
rise
once
again
and
it
shall
be
on
a
familiar
spot
once
more
we
must
place
ourselves
on
the
hawk
lynch
and
look
out
over
the
view
and
the
happy
autumn
fields
ripe
with
the
golden
harvest
two
people
are
approaching
on
horseback
from
the
barton
side
who
have
been
made
one
since
we
left
them
at
the
fall
of
the
curtain
in
the
last
chapter
they
ride
lovingly
together
close
to
one
another
and
forgetful
of
the
whole
world
as
they
should
do
for
they
have
scarcely
come
to
the
end
of
their
honeymoon
they
are
in
country
costume
she
in
a
light
habit
but
well
cut
and
sitting
on
her
as
well
as
she
sits
on
her
dainty
grey
he
in
and
with
his
fishing
basket
slung
over
his
shoulder
they
come
steadily
up
the
hillside
rousing
a
here
and
there
from
the
and
only
draw
bit
when
they
have
reached
the
very
top
of
the
knoll
then
they
dismount
and
tom
produces
two
halters
from
his
fishing
basket
and
taking
off
the
bridles
fastens
the
horses
up
in
the
shade
of
the
and
loosens
their
girths
while
mary
after
searching
in
the
basket
pulls
out
a
bag
and
pours
out
a
prodigal
feed
of
corn
before
each
of
them
on
the
short
grass
what
are
you
doing
you
wasteful
little
woman
you
should
have
put
the
bag
underneath
they
wo
be
able
to
pick
up
half
the
corn
never
mind
dear
then
the
birds
will
get
it
and
you
have
given
them
enough
for
three
feeds
why
did
you
put
so
much
in
the
bag
besides
you
know
it
is
the
last
feed
i
shall
give
her
poor
dear
little
gypsy
she
added
patting
the
neck
of
her
dapple
grey
you
have
found
a
kind
mistress
for
her
dear
have
you
yes
i
know
she
will
be
lightly
worked
and
well
cared
for
he
said
shortly
turning
away
and
busying
himself
with
the
basket
again
but
no
one
will
ever
love
you
gipsy
like
your
old
mistress
now
give
me
a
kiss
and
you
shall
have
your
treat
and
she
pulled
a
piece
of
sugar
out
of
the
pocket
of
her
riding
habit
at
the
sight
of
which
the
grey
held
out
her
beautiful
nose
to
be
fondled
and
then
lapped
up
the
sugar
with
eager
lips
from
hand
and
turned
to
her
corn
the
young
wife
tripped
across
and
sat
down
near
her
husband
who
was
laying
out
their
luncheon
on
the
turf
it
was
very
kind
of
you
think
of
coming
here
for
our
last
ride
she
said
i
remember
how
charmed
i
was
with
the
place
the
first
sunday
i
ever
spent
at
englebourn
when
katie
brought
me
up
here
directly
after
breakfast
before
we
went
to
the
school
such
a
time
ago
it
seems
before
i
ever
saw
you
and
i
have
never
been
here
since
but
i
love
it
most
for
your
sake
dear
now
tell
me
again
all
the
times
you
have
been
here
tom
proceeded
to
recount
some
of
his
visits
to
the
hawk
lynch
in
which
we
have
accompanied
him
then
they
talked
on
about
katie
and
east
and
the
englebourn
people
past
and
present
old
betty
and
harry
and
his
wife
in
new
zealand
and
david
patching
coats
and
tending
bees
and
executing
the
queen
justice
to
the
best
of
his
ability
in
the
village
at
their
feet
poor
david
i
must
get
over
somehow
to
see
him
before
we
leave
home
he
feels
your
uncle
death
and
the
other
changes
in
the
parish
more
than
anyone
i
am
so
sorry
the
living
was
sold
said
mary
katie
and
her
husband
would
have
made
englebourn
into
a
little
paradise
it
could
not
be
helped
dear
i
ca
say
i
sorry
there
would
not
have
been
work
enough
for
him
he
is
better
where
he
is
in
a
great
but
katie
did
love
the
place
so
and
was
so
used
to
it
she
had
become
quite
a
little
queen
there
before
her
marriage
see
what
we
women
have
to
give
up
for
you
she
said
playfully
turning
to
him
but
a
shadow
passed
over
his
face
and
he
looked
away
without
answering
what
makes
you
so
sorrowful
dear
what
are
you
thinking
of
oh
nothing
that
is
true
now
tell
me
what
it
is
you
have
no
right
you
know
to
keep
anything
from
me
i
ca
bear
to
think
that
you
have
had
to
sell
gipsy
you
have
never
been
without
a
riding
horse
till
now
you
will
miss
your
riding
dreadfully
i
am
sure
dear
i
shall
do
very
well
without
riding
i
am
so
proud
of
learning
my
lesson
from
you
you
will
see
what
a
poor
man
wife
i
shall
make
i
have
been
getting
mamma
to
let
me
do
the
and
know
how
a
joint
should
look
and
all
sorts
of
useful
things
and
i
have
made
my
own
i
shall
soon
get
to
hate
all
luxuries
as
much
as
you
do
now
mary
you
must
run
into
extremes
i
never
said
you
ought
to
hate
all
luxuries
but
that
almost
everybody
one
knows
is
a
slave
to
them
well
and
i
hate
anything
that
wants
to
make
a
slave
of
me
you
are
a
dear
little
free
woman
but
now
we
are
on
this
subject
again
mary
i
really
want
to
speak
to
you
about
keeping
a
maid
we
can
quite
afford
it
and
you
ought
to
have
one
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
not
to
oblige
me
mary
no
not
even
to
oblige
you
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
dear
gypsy
but
take
a
maid
again
to
do
nothing
but
torment
me
and
pretend
to
take
care
of
my
clothes
and
my
hair
i
never
knew
what
freedom
was
till
i
got
rid
of
poor
foolish
grumbling
higgins
but
you
may
get
a
nice
girl
who
will
be
a
comfort
to
you
no
i
never
will
have
a
woman
again
to
do
nothing
but
look
after
me
it
is
fair
to
them
besides
dear
you
ca
say
that
i
do
look
better
since
i
have
done
my
own
hair
did
you
ever
see
it
look
brighter
than
it
does
now
never
and
now
here
is
luncheon
all
ready
so
they
sat
down
on
the
verge
of
the
slope
and
ate
their
cold
chicken
and
tongue
with
the
relish
imparted
by
youth
a
long
ride
and
the
bracing
air
mary
was
merrier
and
brighter
than
ever
but
it
was
an
effort
with
him
to
respond
and
soon
she
began
to
notice
this
and
then
there
was
a
pause
which
she
broke
at
last
with
something
of
an
effort
there
is
that
look
again
what
makes
you
look
so
serious
now
i
must
know
was
i
looking
serious
i
beg
your
pardon
dearest
and
i
do
so
again
any
more
and
he
smiled
as
he
answered
but
the
smile
faded
away
before
her
steady
loving
gaze
and
he
turned
slightly
from
her
and
looked
out
over
the
vale
below
she
watched
him
for
a
short
time
in
silence
her
own
fair
young
face
changing
like
a
summer
sea
as
the
light
clouds
pass
over
it
presently
she
seemed
to
have
come
to
some
decision
for
taking
off
her
riding
hat
she
threw
it
and
her
whip
and
gauntlets
on
the
turf
beside
her
and
drawing
nearer
to
his
side
laid
her
hand
on
his
he
looked
at
her
fondly
and
stroking
her
hair
said
take
care
of
your
complexion
mary
oh
it
will
take
care
of
itself
in
this
air
dear
besides
you
are
between
me
and
the
sun
and
now
you
tell
me
why
you
look
so
serious
it
is
not
the
first
time
i
have
noticed
that
look
i
am
your
wife
you
know
and
i
have
a
right
to
know
your
thoughts
and
share
all
your
joy
and
all
your
sorrow
i
do
not
mean
to
give
up
any
of
my
rights
which
i
got
by
marrying
you
your
rights
dearest
your
poor
little
rights
which
you
have
gained
by
changing
name
and
plighting
troth
it
is
thinking
of
that
thinking
of
what
you
have
bought
and
the
price
you
have
paid
for
it
which
makes
me
sad
at
times
even
when
you
are
sitting
by
me
and
laying
your
hand
on
my
hand
and
the
sweet
burden
of
your
pure
life
and
being
on
my
soiled
and
baffled
manhood
but
it
was
my
own
bargain
you
know
dear
and
i
am
satisfied
with
my
purchase
i
paid
the
price
with
my
eyes
open
ah
if
i
only
could
feel
that
but
you
know
that
it
is
true
no
dearest
that
is
the
pinch
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
true
i
often
feel
that
it
is
just
a
bit
not
true
it
was
a
bargain
in
which
one
of
the
parties
had
eyes
open
and
got
all
the
advantage
and
that
party
was
i
i
will
not
have
you
so
conceited
she
said
patting
his
hand
once
or
twice
and
looking
more
bravely
than
ever
up
into
his
eyes
why
should
you
think
you
were
so
much
the
cleverer
of
the
two
as
to
get
all
the
good
out
of
our
bargain
i
am
not
going
to
allow
that
you
were
so
much
the
more
and
women
are
said
to
be
as
as
men
perhaps
it
is
not
i
who
have
been
outwitted
after
all
look
at
the
cost
mary
think
of
what
you
will
have
to
give
up
you
can
not
reckon
it
up
yet
what
are
you
going
back
to
the
and
lady
maid
again
i
thought
i
had
convinced
you
on
those
points
they
are
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
price
you
have
left
a
home
where
everybody
loved
you
you
knew
it
you
were
sure
of
it
you
had
felt
their
love
ever
since
you
could
remember
anything
yes
dear
and
i
feel
it
still
they
will
be
all
just
as
fond
of
me
at
home
though
i
am
your
wife
at
home
it
is
no
longer
your
home
no
i
have
a
home
of
my
own
now
a
new
home
with
new
love
there
to
live
on
and
an
old
home
with
the
old
love
to
think
of
a
new
home
instead
of
an
old
one
a
poor
home
instead
of
a
rich
one
a
home
where
the
cry
of
the
sorrow
and
suffering
of
the
world
will
reach
you
for
one
in
which
you
had
in
which
i
had
not
you
dear
there
now
that
was
my
purchase
i
set
my
mind
on
having
you
buying
you
as
that
is
your
word
i
have
paid
my
price
and
got
my
bargain
and
you
know
i
was
always
an
oddity
and
rather
willful
am
content
with
it
yes
mary
you
have
bought
me
and
you
little
know
dearest
what
you
have
bought
i
can
scarcely
bear
my
own
selfishness
at
times
when
i
think
of
what
your
life
might
have
been
had
i
left
you
alone
and
what
it
must
be
with
me
and
what
might
it
have
been
dear
why
you
might
have
married
some
man
with
plenty
of
money
who
could
have
given
you
everything
to
which
you
have
been
used
i
shall
begin
to
think
that
you
believe
in
luxuries
after
all
if
you
go
on
making
so
much
of
them
you
must
not
go
on
preaching
one
thing
and
practicing
another
i
am
a
convert
to
your
preaching
and
believe
in
the
misery
of
multiplying
artificial
wants
your
wife
must
have
none
yes
but
wealth
and
position
are
not
to
be
despised
i
feel
that
now
that
it
is
all
done
past
recall
and
i
have
to
think
of
you
but
the
loss
of
them
is
a
mere
nothing
to
what
you
will
have
to
go
through
what
do
you
mean
dear
of
course
we
must
expect
some
troubles
like
other
people
why
i
mean
mary
that
you
might
at
least
have
married
a
contented
man
some
one
who
found
the
world
a
very
good
world
and
was
satisfied
with
things
as
they
are
and
had
light
enough
to
steer
himself
by
and
not
a
fellow
like
me
full
of
all
manner
of
doubts
and
perplexities
who
sees
little
but
wrong
in
the
world
about
him
and
more
in
himself
you
think
i
should
have
been
more
comfortable
yes
more
comfortable
and
happier
what
right
had
i
to
bring
my
worries
on
you
for
i
know
you
ca
live
with
me
dearest
and
not
be
bothered
and
annoyed
when
i
am
anxious
and
dissatisfied
but
what
if
i
did
not
marry
you
to
be
comfortable
my
darling
you
never
thought
about
it
and
i
was
too
selfish
to
think
for
you
there
now
you
see
it
just
as
i
said
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
are
quite
wrong
in
thinking
that
i
have
been
deceived
i
did
not
marry
you
dear
to
be
comfortable
and
i
did
think
it
all
over
ay
over
and
over
again
so
you
are
not
to
run
away
with
the
belief
that
you
have
taken
me
in
i
shall
be
glad
enough
to
give
it
up
dearest
if
you
can
convince
me
then
you
will
listen
while
i
explain
yes
with
all
my
ears
and
all
my
heart
you
remember
the
year
we
met
when
we
danced
and
went
nutting
together
a
thoughtless
boy
and
girl
remember
it
have
i
ever
you
are
not
to
interrupt
of
course
you
remember
it
all
and
are
ready
to
tell
me
that
you
loved
me
the
first
moment
that
you
saw
me
at
the
window
in
high
street
well
perhaps
i
shall
not
object
to
being
told
it
at
a
proper
time
but
now
i
am
making
my
confessions
i
liked
you
then
because
you
were
katie
cousin
and
almost
my
first
partner
and
were
never
tired
of
dancing
and
were
generally
merry
and
pleasant
though
you
sometimes
took
to
lecturing
even
in
those
days
but
mary
you
are
to
be
silent
now
and
listen
i
liked
you
then
but
you
are
not
to
look
conceited
and
flatter
yourself
it
was
only
a
girl
fancy
i
could
have
married
you
then
given
myself
up
to
you
no
i
do
think
i
could
even
on
the
night
when
fished
for
me
out
of
the
window
with
the
heather
and
heliotrope
though
i
kept
them
and
have
them
still
and
then
came
that
scene
down
below
at
old
simon
cottage
and
i
thought
i
should
never
wish
to
see
you
again
and
then
i
came
out
in
london
and
went
abroad
i
scarcely
heard
of
you
again
for
a
year
for
katie
hardly
ever
mentioned
you
in
her
letters
and
though
i
sometimes
wished
that
she
would
and
thought
i
should
just
like
to
know
what
you
were
doing
i
was
too
proud
to
ask
meantime
i
went
out
and
enjoyed
myself
and
had
a
great
many
pretty
things
said
to
me
much
prettier
things
than
you
ever
said
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
pleasant
young
men
friends
of
papa
and
mamma
many
of
them
with
good
establishments
too
but
i
shall
not
tell
you
anything
more
about
them
or
you
will
be
going
off
about
the
luxuries
i
have
been
used
to
then
i
began
to
hear
of
you
again
katie
came
to
stay
with
us
and
i
met
some
of
your
oxford
friends
poor
dear
katie
she
was
full
of
you
and
your
wild
sayings
and
doings
and
but
all
the
time
the
best
and
truest
friend
you
ever
had
some
of
the
rest
were
not
friends
at
all
and
i
have
heard
many
a
sneer
and
unkind
word
and
stories
of
your
monstrous
speeches
and
habits
some
said
you
were
mad
others
that
you
liked
to
be
eccentric
that
you
could
bear
to
live
with
your
equals
that
you
sought
the
society
of
your
inferiors
to
be
flattered
i
listened
and
thought
it
all
over
and
being
willful
and
eccentric
myself
you
know
liked
more
and
more
to
hear
about
you
and
hoped
i
should
see
you
again
some
day
i
was
curious
to
judge
for
myself
whether
you
were
much
changed
for
the
better
or
the
worse
and
at
last
came
the
day
when
i
saw
you
again
carrying
the
poor
lame
child
and
after
that
you
know
what
happened
so
here
we
are
dear
and
you
are
my
husband
and
you
will
please
never
to
look
serious
again
from
any
foolish
thought
that
i
have
been
taken
in
that
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
about
when
i
took
you
better
or
for
worse
for
richer
or
for
poorer
in
sickness
and
in
health
till
death
us
do
part
now
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
nothing
but
a
great
deal
for
you
i
see
more
and
more
my
darling
what
a
brave
generous
pitying
angel
i
have
tied
to
myself
but
seeing
that
makes
me
despise
myself
more
what
you
are
going
to
dare
to
disobey
me
already
i
ca
help
it
dearest
all
you
say
shows
me
more
and
more
that
you
have
made
all
the
sacrifice
and
i
am
to
get
all
the
benefit
a
man
like
me
has
no
right
to
bring
such
a
woman
as
you
under
his
burden
but
you
could
help
yourself
it
was
because
you
were
out
of
sorts
with
the
world
smarting
with
the
wrongs
you
saw
on
every
side
struggling
after
something
better
and
higher
and
siding
and
sympathizing
with
the
poor
and
weak
that
i
loved
you
we
should
never
have
been
here
dear
if
you
had
been
a
young
gentleman
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
world
and
likely
to
get
on
well
in
society
ah
mary
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
man
it
is
a
man
business
but
why
is
a
woman
life
to
be
made
wretched
why
should
you
be
dragged
into
all
my
perplexities
and
doubts
and
dreams
and
struggles
and
why
should
i
not
life
should
be
all
bright
and
beautiful
to
a
woman
it
is
every
man
duty
to
shield
her
from
all
that
can
vex
or
pain
or
soil
but
have
women
different
souls
from
men
god
forbid
then
are
we
not
fit
to
share
your
highest
hopes
to
share
our
highest
hopes
yes
when
we
have
any
but
the
mire
and
clay
where
one
sticks
fast
over
and
over
again
with
no
high
hopes
or
high
anything
else
in
sight
a
man
must
be
a
selfish
brute
to
bring
any
one
he
pretends
to
love
into
all
that
now
tom
she
said
almost
solemnly
you
are
not
true
to
yourself
would
you
part
with
your
own
deepest
convictions
would
you
if
you
could
go
back
to
the
time
when
you
cared
for
and
thought
about
none
of
these
things
he
thought
a
minute
and
then
pressing
her
hand
said
no
dearest
i
would
not
the
consciousness
of
the
darkness
in
one
and
around
one
brings
the
longing
for
light
and
then
the
light
dawns
through
mist
and
fog
perhaps
but
enough
to
pick
ones
way
by
he
stopped
a
moment
and
then
added
and
shines
ever
brighter
unto
the
perfect
day
yes
i
begin
to
know
it
then
why
not
put
me
on
your
own
level
why
not
let
me
pick
my
way
by
your
side
can
not
a
woman
feel
the
wrongs
that
are
going
on
in
the
world
can
not
she
long
to
see
them
set
right
and
pray
that
they
may
be
set
right
we
are
not
meant
to
sit
in
fine
silks
and
look
pretty
and
spend
money
any
more
than
you
are
meant
to
make
it
and
cry
peace
where
there
is
no
peace
if
a
woman
can
not
do
much
herself
she
can
honor
and
love
a
man
who
can
he
turned
to
her
and
bent
over
her
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
kissed
her
lips
she
looked
up
with
sparkling
eyes
and
said
am
i
not
right
dear
yes
you
are
right
and
i
have
been
false
to
my
creed
you
have
taken
a
load
off
my
heart
dearest
henceforth
there
shall
be
but
one
mind
and
one
soul
between
us
you
have
made
me
feel
what
it
is
that
a
man
wants
what
is
the
help
that
is
mete
for
him
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
kissed
her
again
and
then
rose
up
for
there
was
something
within
him
like
a
moving
of
new
life
which
lifted
him
and
set
him
on
his
feet
and
he
stood
with
kindling
brow
gazing
into
the
autumn
air
as
his
heart
went
sorrowing
but
hopefully
sorrowing
back
through
all
the
faultful
past
and
she
sat
on
at
first
and
watched
his
face
and
neither
spoke
nor
moved
for
some
minutes
then
she
rose
too
and
stood
by
his
side
and
on
her
lover
arm
she
leant
and
round
her
waist
she
felt
it
fold
and
so
across
the
hills
they
went
in
that
new
world
which
is
the
old
yes
that
new
world
through
the
golden
gates
of
which
they
had
passed
together
which
is
the
old
old
world
after
all
and
nothing
else
the
same
old
and
new
world
it
was
to
our
fathers
and
mothers
as
it
is
to
us
and
shall
be
to
our
children
a
world
clear
and
bright
and
ever
becoming
clearer
and
brighter
to
the
humble
and
true
and
pure
of
heart
to
every
man
and
woman
who
will
live
in
it
as
the
children
of
the
maker
and
lord
of
it
their
father
to
them
and
to
them
alone
is
that
world
old
and
new
given
and
all
that
is
in
it
fully
and
freely
to
enjoy
all
others
but
these
are
occupying
where
they
have
no
title
they
are
sowing
much
but
bringing
in
little
they
eat
but
have
not
enough
they
drink
but
are
not
filled
with
drink
they
clothe
themselves
but
there
is
none
warm
and
he
of
them
who
earneth
wages
earneth
wages
to
put
them
into
a
bag
with
holes
but
these
have
the
world
and
all
things
for
a
rightful
and
rich
inheritance
for
they
hold
them
as
dear
children
of
him
in
whose
hand
it
and
they
are
lying
and
no
power
in
earth
or
hell
shall
pluck
them
out
of
their
father
hand
finis
