story
a
pretty
story
of
flowers
and
gems
and
birds

young

little
princess

nothing

psyche
chapter
i
gigantically
massive
with
three
hundred
towers
on
the
summit
of
a
rocky
mountain
rose
the
king
castle
high
into
the
clouds
but
the
summit
was
broad
and
flat
as
a
plateau
and
the
castle
spread
far
out
for
miles
and
miles
with
ramparts
and
walls
and
pinnacles
and
everywhere
rose
up
the
towers
lost
in
the
clouds
and
the
castle
was
like
a
city
built
upon
a
lofty
rock
of
basalt
round
the
castle
and
far
away
lay
the
valleys
of
the
kingdom
receding
into
the
horizon
one
after
the
other
and
ever
and
ever
ever
changing
was
the
horizon
now
pink
then
silver
now
blue
then
golden
now
grey
then
white
and
misty
and
gradually
fading
away
and
never
could
the
last
be
seen
in
clear
weather
there
loomed
behind
the
horizon
always
another
horizon
they
circled
one
another
endlessly
they
were
lost
in
the
dissolving
mists
and
suddenly
their
silhouette
became
more
sharply
defined
over
the
lofty
towers
stretched
away
at
times
an
expanse
of
variegated
clouds
but
below
rushed
a
torrent
which
fell
like
a
cataract
into
a
fathomless
abyss
that
made
one
dizzy
to
look
at
so
it
seemed
as
if
the
castle
rose
up
to
the
highest
stars
and
went
down
to
the
central
nave
of
the
earth
along
the
battlements
higher
than
a
man
psyche
often
wandered
wandered
round
the
castle
from
tower
to
tower
from
wall
to
wall
with
a
dreamy
smile
on
her
face
then
she
looked
up
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
the
stars
or
gazed
below
at
the
dashing
water
with
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
till
her
head
grew
dizzy
and
she
drew
back
and
placed
her
little
hands
before
her
eyes
and
long
she
would
sit
in
the
corner
of
an
embrasure
her
eyes
looking
far
away
a
smile
on
her
face
her
knees
drawn
up
and
her
arms
entwining
them
and
her
tiny
wings
spread
out
against
the
mossy
like
a
butterfly
that
sat
motionless
and
she
gazed
at
the
horizon
and
however
much
she
gazed
she
always
saw
more
close
by
were
the
green
valleys
dotted
with
grazing
sheep
soft
meadows
with
fat
cattle
waving
canals
covered
with
ships
and
the
cottage
roofs
of
a
village
farther
away
were
lines
of
woods
or
a
mass
of
angular
basalt
still
farther
off
misty
towers
with
minarets
and
domes
cupolas
and
spires
smoking
chimneys
and
the
outline
of
a
broad
river
beyond
the
horizon
became
or
like
an
opal
but
not
a
line
more
was
there
only
tint
the
reflection
of
the
last
glow
of
the
sun
as
if
lakes
were
mirrored
there
islands
rose
low
in
the
air
aerial
paradises
watery
streaks
of
blue
sea
oceans
of
ether
and
light
quivering
nothingness
and
psyche
gazed
and
mused
she
was
the
third
princess
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
old
king
monarch
of
the
kingdom
of
the
past
she
was
always
very
lonely
her
sisters
she
seldom
saw
her
father
only
for
a
moment
in
the
evening
before
she
went
to
bed
and
when
she
had
the
chance
she
fled
from
the
mumbling
old
nurse
and
wandered
along
the
battlements
and
dreamed
with
her
eyes
far
away
gazing
at
the
vast
kingdom
beyond
which
was
nothingness
oh
how
she
longed
to
go
farther
than
the
castle
to
the
meadows
the
woods
the
towns
to
go
to
the
shining
lakes
the
opal
islands
the
oceans
of
ether
and
then
to
that
far
nothingness
that
quivered
so
like
a
pale
pale
light
would
she
ever
be
able
to
pass
out
of
the
gates
oh
how
she
longed
to
wander
to
seek
to
fly
to
fly
oh
to
fly
to
fly
as
the
sparrows
the
doves
the
eagles
and
she
flapped
her
weak
little
wings
on
her
tender
shoulders
there
were
two
wings
like
those
of
a
very
large
butterfly
transparent
membranes
covered
with
crimson
and
soft
yellow
dust
streaked
with
azure
and
pink
where
they
were
joined
to
her
back
and
on
each
wing
glowed
two
eyes
like
those
on
a
tail
but
more
beautiful
in
colour
and
glistening
like
jewels
fine
sapphires
and
emeralds
on
velvet
and
the
velvet
eye
set
four
times
in
the
glittering
texture
of
the
wings
her
wings
she
flapped
but
with
them
she
could
not
fly
that
that
was
her
great
grief
that
that
made
her
think
what
were
they
for
those
wings
on
her
shoulders
and
she
shook
them
and
flapped
them
but
could
not
rise
above
the
ground
her
delicate
form
did
not
ascend
into
the
air
her
naked
foot
remained
firm
on
the
ground
and
only
her
thin
fine
veil
that
trailed
a
little
round
her
limbs
was
slightly
raised
by
the
gentle
fluttering
of
her
wings
chapter
ii
to
fly
oh
to
fly
she
was
so
fond
of
birds
how
she
envied
them
she
enticed
them
with
crumbs
of
bread
with
grains
of
corn
and
once
she
had
rescued
a
dove
from
an
eagle
the
dove
she
had
hidden
under
her
veil
pressed
close
to
her
bosom
and
the
eagle
she
had
courageously
driven
off
with
her
hand
when
in
his
flight
he
overshadowed
her
with
his
broad
wings
calling
out
to
him
to
go
away
and
leave
her
dove
unhurt
oh
to
seek
to
seek
for
she
was
so
fond
of
flowers
and
gladly
in
the
woods
and
meadows
or
farther
away
still
would
she
have
sought
for
those
that
were
unknown
but
she
cultivated
them
within
the
walls
on
the
rocky
ground
and
she
had
made
herself
a
garden
the
buds
opened
when
she
looked
at
them
the
stems
grew
when
she
stroked
them
and
when
she
kissed
a
faded
flower
it
became
as
fresh
again
as
ever
to
wander
oh
to
wander
then
she
wandered
along
the
battlements
down
the
steps
over
the
and
the
ramparts
but
at
the
gates
stood
the
guards
rough
and
bearded
and
clad
in
mail
with
horns
round
their
shoulders
then
she
could
go
no
farther
and
wandered
back
into
the
vaults
and
crypts
where
sacred
spiders
wove
their
webs
and
then
if
she
became
frightened
she
hurried
away
farther
farther
farther
along
endless
galleries
between
rows
of
motionless
knights
in
armour
till
she
came
again
to
her
nurse
who
sat
ever
at
her
oh
to
glide
through
the
air
to
glide
in
a
steady
wind
to
the
farthest
horizon
to
the
and
opal
region
which
she
saw
in
her
dreams
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
to
glide
to
the
seas
and
the
islands
which
yonder
so
far
far
away
and
so
unsubstantial
changed
every
moment
as
if
a
breeze
could
alter
their
form
their
tint
so
unfirm
that
no
foot
could
tread
them
but
only
a
winged
being
like
herself
a
bird
a
fairy
could
gently
hover
over
them
to
see
all
that
beautiful
landscape
to
enjoy
that
atmosphere
that
dream
of
paradise
oh
to
fly
to
seek
to
wander
to
soar
and
for
hours
together
she
sat
dreaming
in
an
embrasure
her
eyes
far
off
her
arms
round
her
knees
and
her
wings
spread
out
like
a
little
butterfly
that
sat
motionless
chapter
iii
emeralda
that
was
the
name
of
her
eldest
sister
surpassingly
beautiful
was
emeralda
dazzling
fair
as
no
woman
in
the
kingdom
no
princess
in
other
kingdoms
exceedingly
tall
she
was
and
majestic
in
stature
erect
she
walked
stately
and
proudly
she
was
very
proud
for
after
the
death
of
the
king
she
was
to
reign
on
the
throne
of
the
kingdom
of
the
past
jealous
of
all
the
power
which
would
be
hers
she
rejected
all
the
princes
who
sued
for
her
hand
she
never
spoke
but
to
command
and
only
to
her
father
did
she
bow
she
always
wore
heavy
brocade
silver
or
gold
studded
with
jewels
and
long
mantles
of
rustling
silk
fringed
with
broad
ermine
a
diadem
of
the
finest
jewels
always
glittered
on
her
red
golden
hair
and
her
eyes
also
were
jewels
two
magnificent
green
emeralds
in
which
a
black
carbuncle
was
the
pupil
and
people
whispered
secretly
that
her
heart
was
cut
out
of
one
single
gigantic
ruby
oh
psyche
was
so
afraid
of
her
when
psyche
wandered
through
the
castle
and
suddenly
saw
emeralda
coming
preceded
by
pages
torches
and
who
bore
her
train
and
a
score
of
halberdiers
then
she
was
struck
with
fear
and
hastily
concealed
herself
behind
a
door
a
curtain
no
matter
where
and
then
emeralda
rustled
by
with
a
great
noise
of
satin
and
gold
and
all
the
trampling
of
her
retinue
and
psyche
heart
beat
loudly
like
a
clock
tick
tick
tick
tick
till
she
thought
she
would
faint
then
she
shut
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
cold
proud
look
of
emeralda
green
emeralds
which
pierced
through
the
curtains
and
saw
psyche
well
enough
though
she
pretended
not
to
see
her
and
when
emeralda
was
gone
then
psyche
fled
upstairs
high
up
on
to
the
battlements
fetched
a
deep
breath
pressed
her
hands
to
her
bosom
and
long
afterwards
her
little
wings
trembled
from
fear
astra
that
was
the
name
of
the
second
princess
she
wore
a
living
star
upon
her
head
she
was
very
wise
and
learned
she
knew
much
more
than
all
the
philosophers
and
learned
men
in
the
kingdom
who
came
to
her
for
counsel
she
lived
in
the
highest
tower
of
the
castle
and
sometimes
along
the
bars
of
her
window
she
saw
clouds
pass
by
like
spirits
of
the
mist
she
never
left
the
tower
she
sat
surrounded
by
rolls
of
parchment
gigantic
globes
which
she
turned
with
a
pressure
of
her
finger
and
after
hours
of
contemplation
she
described
with
great
compasses
on
a
slab
of
black
marble
circle
after
circle
or
reckoned
out
long
sums
with
numbers
so
great
that
no
one
could
pronounce
them
sometimes
she
sat
surrounded
by
the
sages
of
the
land
and
the
king
himself
came
and
listened
to
his
daughter
as
in
a
low
firm
voice
she
explained
things
but
because
she
possessed
all
the
wisdom
of
the
earth
she
despised
all
the
world
and
she
had
had
constructed
on
the
terrace
of
her
tower
a
telescope
miles
long
through
which
she
could
look
to
every
part
of
the
illimitable
firmament
and
when
the
sages
were
gone
and
she
was
alone
then
she
went
on
to
the
terrace
and
peered
through
the
giant
which
she
turned
to
all
the
points
of
the
compass
through
the
diamond
lenses
cut
without
facets
she
saw
new
stars
unknown
to
men
and
gave
them
names
through
the
diamond
lenses
she
saw
sun
systems
spirals
of
fire
shrivel
up
through
the
illimitableness
of
the
universe
but
she
kept
gazing
for
behind
those
sun
systems
she
knew
were
other
spheres
other
heavens
and
there
farther
still
illimitably
far
was
the
mystic
rose
which
she
could
never
see
sometimes
when
psyche
wandered
round
the
castle
she
knocked
nervously
inquisitively
at
astra
door
who
graciously
allowed
her
to
enter
when
astra
stood
before
the
board
and
reckoned
out
long
sums
psyche
looked
very
earnestly
at
her
sister
star
which
glistened
on
her
head
in
her
hair
or
she
went
on
to
the
terrace
and
peeped
through
the
telescope
but
she
saw
nothing
but
very
bright
light
which
made
her
eyes
ache
chapter
iv
in
the
evening
before
she
went
to
sleep
psyche
sought
the
king
a
good
hundred
years
old
he
was
his
beard
hung
down
to
his
girdle
and
generally
he
sat
reading
the
historical
scrolls
of
the
kingdom
which
his
ministers
brought
him
every
day
but
in
the
evening
psyche
climbed
on
to
his
knees
and
nestled
in
his
beard
or
sat
at
his
feet
in
the
folds
of
his
tabard
and
the
scroll
fell
to
the
ground
and
crumpled
up
and
the
withered
hand
of
the
mighty
monarch
stroked
the
head
of
his
third
child
the
princess
with
the
little
wings
father
dear
asked
psyche
once
why
have
i
wings
and
can
not
fly
you
need
not
fly
child
you
are
much
safer
with
me
than
if
you
were
a
little
bird
in
the
air
but
why
then
have
i
wings
i
do
quite
know
my
child
why
have
i
wings
and
astra
a
living
star
upon
her
head
and
emeralda
eyes
of
jewels
because
you
are
princesses
they
are
different
from
other
girls
and
why
dear
father
whispered
psyche
secretly
has
emeralda
a
heart
of
ruby
no
child
that
she
has
not
she
has
it
is
true
eyes
of
emerald
because
she
is
a
princess
as
astra
has
a
star
and
you
two
pretty
wings
but
she
has
a
human
heart
no
father
dear
she
has
a
heart
of
stone
but
who
says
so
my
child
the
nurse
does
father
her
own
pages
the
guards
at
the
gates
and
the
wise
men
who
come
to
astra
the
king
was
very
sad
he
and
his
daughter
looked
deep
into
each
other
eyes
and
embraced
each
other
for
the
king
was
sad
on
account
of
what
he
saw
in
the
future
and
psyche
was
frightened
she
always
trembled
when
she
thought
of
emeralda
little
psyche
said
her
old
father
will
you
now
promise
me
something
yes
father
dear
will
you
always
stay
with
me
little
psyche
you
are
safe
here
are
you
not
and
the
world
is
so
great
the
world
is
so
wicked
the
world
is
full
of
temptation
and
mystery
winged
horses
soar
through
the
air
gigantic
sphinxes
lurk
in
the
deserts
devilish
fauns
roam
through
the
forests
in
the
world
tears
are
shed
which
form
brooks
and
in
the
world
people
give
away
their
noblest
right
for
the
lowest
pleasure
stay
with
me
psyche
never
wander
too
far
away
for
under
our
castle
glows
the
and
life
is
like
a
princess
a
cruel
princess
with
a
heart
of
stone
of
precious
stone
like
emeralda
thought
psyche
to
herself
who
rides
in
triumph
with
her
victorious
chariot
over
the
tenderest
and
dearest
and
presses
them
into
the
deepest
furrows
of
the
earth
oh
psyche
little
psyche
promise
me
always
to
stay
here
in
this
high
and
safe
castle
always
to
stay
with
your
father
she
did
not
understand
him
his
eyes
very
large
and
animated
looked
over
her
into
space
with
inexpressible
sadness
then
she
longed
to
console
him
and
threw
her
white
arms
round
his
neck
she
hid
herself
as
it
were
in
his
beard
and
she
whispered
playfully
i
will
always
stay
with
you
father
dear
then
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
thought
that
he
would
soon
die
chapter
v
psyche
was
often
very
lonely
but
yet
she
had
much
she
had
the
flowers
the
birds
she
had
the
butterflies
which
thought
that
she
was
a
bigger
sister
she
had
the
lizards
with
which
she
played
and
which
like
little
things
of
emerald
she
held
against
her
veil
she
had
the
swans
in
the
deep
castle
moats
which
followed
her
when
she
walked
on
the
ramparts
she
had
the
clouds
which
came
floating
from
distant
islands
and
paradises
beyond
she
had
the
wind
which
sang
her
ballads
the
rain
which
fell
down
wet
upon
her
and
covered
her
wings
with
pearls
she
would
gladly
have
played
with
the
pages
in
the
halls
have
laughed
with
the
in
the
armoury
have
listened
to
the
martial
tales
of
the
bearded
halberdiers
at
the
gates
but
she
was
a
princess
and
knew
she
could
not
do
that
and
she
always
walked
past
them
with
great
dignity
maidenly
modest
in
her
fine
thin
veil
which
left
her
tender
limbs
half
exposed
that
was
the
noble
nakedness
which
was
her
privilege
as
a
princess
a
privilege
given
her
at
her
cradle
together
with
her
wings
by
the
fairy
of
births
as
to
emeralda
was
given
the
jewel
and
to
astra
the
star
for
never
might
psyche
wear
jewel
or
star
and
never
might
emeralda
or
astra
go
naked
each
princess
had
her
own
privilege
her
birthright
adorable
was
psyche
as
unconscious
of
her
maidenly
tender
purity
she
was
seen
with
her
crimson
glittering
wings
naked
in
the
folds
of
her
veil
walking
past
the
and
soldiers
who
presented
their
swords
or
halberds
as
the
princess
stepped
past
them
psyche
was
often
very
lonely
for
her
nurse
was
old
and
mumbled
over
her
playmates
psyche
had
not
because
she
was
a
princess
and
she
would
not
get
till
she
was
older
and
more
dignified
but
with
the
birds
and
the
clouds
and
the
wind
psyche
could
speak
and
laugh
and
she
was
seldom
dull
although
she
sometimes
wished
she
were
no
longer
princess
of
nakedness
with
the
wings
but
one
of
those
very
ordinary
whom
she
had
seen
milking
the
cows
or
plucking
the
thick
bunches
of
grapes
in
the
vineyard
at
whilst
the
pressers
handsome
brown
lads
with
sturdy
arms
encircled
the
girls
and
danced
but
psyche
wandered
along
the
ramparts
she
looked
at
the
clouds
and
spoke
with
the
wind
and
she
asked
the
wind
to
give
flight
to
her
wings
so
that
she
could
fly
far
off
to
the
opal
landscapes
that
kept
shifting
and
changing
but
the
wind
rushed
away
with
a
flapping
noise
of
wings
that
psyche
envied
and
her
own
wings
flapped
a
little
but
in
vain
psyche
looked
at
the
clouds
they
floated
along
so
stately
in
all
kinds
of
forms
in
the
forms
of
sheep
swans
horses
and
the
form
never
remained
the
seeming
forms
in
the
blue
ether
were
constantly
changing
now
she
saw
three
swans
which
were
drawing
a
boat
in
which
stood
three
women
who
guided
the
swans
then
she
saw
the
women
become
a
tower
the
swans
a
dragon
and
from
far
far
away
came
a
knight
sitting
on
a
winged
horse
but
now
slowly
the
scene
changed
into
a
flock
of
little
downy
sheep
which
were
browsing
far
off
in
the
sunshine
as
in
a
golden
meadow
the
knight
disappeared
but
the
horse
glided
nearer
and
flew
on
his
wings
high
over
the
castle
towards
the
sheep
then
psyche
dreamed
at
night
of
the
swans
the
tower
the
dragon
the
knight
the
horse
but
the
horse
she
liked
best
because
it
had
strong
wings
and
next
morning
she
gazed
from
the
battlements
to
see
if
the
horse
would
come
again
but
then
the
sky
was
either
gloomy
from
the
rain
or
blue
from
the
absence
of
clouds
or
covered
with
white
peacock
feathers
splendid
plumes
but
motionless
far
far
away
in
the
air
the
wind
changed
when
she
said
away
blow
now
from
the
east
again
begone
north
wind
with
your
dark
perils
begone
begone
west
wind
with
your
begone
south
wind
with
your
peacock
feathers
come
now
wind
from
the
east
with
your
treasures
of
luxurious
visions
ye
dragons
ye
horses
ye
girls
with
swans
then
the
clouds
began
to
shift
the
winds
to
blow
and
play
an
opera
high
up
in
the
air
and
psyche
enchanted
sat
and
gazed
then
after
weeks
after
she
had
missed
it
for
weeks
came
again
the
winged
horse
and
she
beckoned
to
it
to
approach
to
descend
to
her
but
it
flew
past
over
the
castle
then
she
missed
it
again
for
many
days
and
angry
she
looked
at
the
sky
and
scolded
the
wind
but
then
the
horse
came
again
and
laughing
she
beckoned
to
it
the
horse
ascended
high
its
wings
expanded
in
the
air
and
oh
wonder
it
beckoned
to
her
to
come
up
up
to
it
she
gave
a
sign
that
she
could
not
shook
her
little
shoulders
helplessly
and
trembling
flapped
her
wings
and
spread
her
arms
wide
out
to
say
that
she
could
not
and
the
horse
sped
away
on
the
breath
of
the
wind
from
the
east
then
psyche
wept
and
sad
at
heart
sat
looking
at
the
far
landscapes
which
she
would
never
reach
but
weeks
afterwards
the
wind
blew
again
and
again
appeared
the
horse
in
the
horizon
and
it
flew
near
and
beckoned
to
psyche
her
heart
heavy
with
hope
and
fear
the
horse
mounted
up
it
beckoned
to
her
she
gave
a
sign
that
she
could
not
and
oh
she
feared
that
it
would
speed
away
again
the
horse
with
the
strong
wings
no
no
the
horse
descended
then
psyche
uttered
a
joyful
cry
sprang
up
danced
with
delight
and
clapped
her
little
hands
from
the
lofty
lofty
sky
the
horse
came
down
gliding
on
its
broad
wings
it
came
down
and
psyche
the
little
joyful
excited
psyche
saw
it
coming
coming
down
to
her
it
descended
it
approached
oh
what
a
beautiful
horse
it
was
greater
than
the
greatest
horses
and
then
with
wings
fair
it
was
fair
as
the
sun
with
a
long
curly
mane
and
long
flowing
tail
like
a
streamer
of
sunny
gold
the
noble
head
on
its
arched
neck
proudly
raised
and
its
eyes
shone
like
fire
and
a
stream
of
breath
came
from
its
expanded
nostrils
cloud
after
cloud
big
powerful
muscular
its
wings
were
stretched
out
like
silvery
quills
as
psyche
had
never
seen
in
a
bird
before
and
its
golden
hoofs
struck
the
clouds
and
made
them
thunder
and
sparks
of
fire
shot
forth
in
the
pure
clear
daylight
enraptured
psyche
had
never
seen
such
a
beautiful
horse
before
never
a
bird
so
beautiful
and
breathless
with
her
head
raised
she
waited
till
it
should
descend
descend
on
the
terrace
at
last
there
it
stood
before
her
its
nostrils
steamed
and
its
hoofs
struck
sparks
from
the
basalt
rock
and
it
waved
its
mane
and
switched
its
tail
splendid
beautiful
horse
said
psyche
who
are
you
i
am
the
chimera
answered
the
horse
and
his
voice
sounded
deep
as
the
clang
of
a
brazen
clock
can
you
really
speak
asked
psyche
astonished
and
fly
oh
how
happy
you
must
be
why
have
you
called
me
little
princess
said
the
chimera
i
wanted
to
see
you
quite
near
replied
psyche
i
only
saw
you
dart
like
winged
lightning
through
the
air
so
soon
were
you
away
again
and
i
was
always
sorry
when
i
could
not
see
you
any
more
then
i
became
oh
so
sad
and
why
did
you
want
to
see
me
quite
near
little
princess
with
the
wings
i
find
you
so
beautiful
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
i
did
not
know
that
anything
so
beautiful
existed
what
are
you
a
horse
you
are
not
nor
a
dragon
either
nor
a
man
what
are
you
i
am
the
chimera
where
do
you
come
from
from
far
away
from
the
lands
which
are
beyond
the
lands
from
the
worlds
beyond
the
worlds
from
the
heavens
beyond
the
heavens
where
are
you
going
very
far
do
you
see
those
distant
regions
yonder
of
silver
and
opal
well
thousands
of
times
so
far
i
am
going
i
go
from
illimitableness
to
illimitableness
i
come
from
nothingness
and
i
am
going
to
nothingness
what
is
nothingness
everything
nothingness
is
as
far
as
your
brains
can
think
my
little
princess
and
then
still
farther
and
nothingness
is
more
than
all
that
you
see
from
this
high
tower
are
you
never
tired
no
my
wings
are
strong
i
can
bear
all
mankind
on
my
back
and
i
could
carry
them
away
to
the
stars
behind
the
stars
if
astra
knew
that
astra
knows
it
but
she
does
not
want
me
she
reckons
out
the
stars
with
figures
why
do
you
fly
from
one
end
to
the
other
o
splendid
chimera
what
is
your
object
what
are
you
for
what
is
your
own
object
little
psyche
what
are
you
yourself
for
for
what
are
flowers
men
the
stars
who
knows
astra
no
astra
knows
nothing
her
knowledge
is
founded
on
a
fundamental
error
all
her
knowledge
is
like
a
tower
which
will
fall
down
i
should
like
to
know
much
i
should
like
to
know
more
i
should
like
to
seek
far
through
the
universe
i
long
for
what
is
most
beautiful
but
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
perhaps
you
yourself
are
what
is
most
beautiful
chimera
but
why
are
you
now
spreading
out
your
wings
i
must
go
so
soon
whence
oh
why
are
you
going
so
soon
splendid
chimera
i
must
i
must
traverse
illimitableness
i
have
already
stayed
here
too
long
stay
a
little
longer
i
can
not
i
may
not
who
compels
you
o
powerful
horse
quick
as
lightning
power
what
is
power
god
who
is
god
oh
tell
me
more

me
more
do
go
away
yet
i
want
to
ask
you
so
much
to
hear
so
much
i
am
so
stupid
i
have
longed
so
for
you
now
you
have
come
and
now
you
want
to
go
away
again
do
not
ask
me
for
wisdom
i
have
none

the
sphinx
for
wisdom
ask
me
for
flight
oh

little
longer

so
with
your
flaming
wings
who

the
sphinx
o
chimera

me
wisdom
but
flight

now
when
then
later
when
is
that
farewell
o
chimera
chimera
the
horse
had
already
spread
out
his
wings
broad
he
was
ascending
but
psyche
suddenly
threw
both
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
hung
on
to
his
mane
let
me
go
little
princess
cried
the
horse
i
ascend
quickly
and
you
will
fall
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rock
loose
me
and
slowly
he
ascended
psyche
was
afraid
she
let
go
her
arms
she
became
dizzy
fell
against
the
pinnacle
and
bruised
one
of
her
wings
that
pained
her
but
she
heeded
it
not
the
horse
was
already
high
in
the
air
and
she
followed
his
track
with
her
eyes
he
is
gone
thought
she
will
he
come
again
or
have
i
seen
him
for
the
first
and
last
time
as
a
dream
he
came
from
regions
and
to
still
farther
regions
he
has
gone
oh
how
dull
the
world
seems
how
dead
is
the
horizon
and
how
dizzy
i
feel
my
wing
pains
me
with
her
hand
she
smoothed
the
wrinkle
out
of
her
wing
she
stroked
it
till
it
was
smooth
again
and
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
horrid
wings
they
can
not
fly
they
can
not
follow
the
strong
chimera
i
in
such
trouble
such
trouble
but
no
is
that
trouble
is
that
happiness
i
know
not
i
am
very
happy
i
am
so
sorrowful
how
beautiful
he
was
how
strong
how
sleek
how
splendid
how
quick
how
wise
how
noble
how
broad
his
wings
how
broad
his
wings
how
weak
i
am
compared
to
him
a
child
a
weak
child
a
weak
naked
child
with
little
wings
o
chimera
my
chimera
o
chimera
of
my
desire
come
back
come
back
come
back
i
can
not
live
without
you
and
if
you
do
not
come
again
chimera
then
i
will
not
live
any
longer
lonely
in
this
high
castle
i
will
throw
myself
into
the
cataract
she
stood
up
her
eyes
looking
eagerly
into
the
empty
air
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
bosom
she
wept
and
her
wings
trembled
as
if
from
fever
then
suddenly
she
saw
the
king
her
father
sitting
at
the
of
his
room
he
did
not
see
her
he
was
reading
a
scroll
but
anxious
lest
he
should
see
her
trouble
her
despair
and
longing
desire
she
fled
along
the
battlements
the
ramparts
through
the
passages
and
halls
of
the
castle
till
she
came
to
the
tower
where
her
nurse
sat
at
her
and
then
she
fell
down
at
the
feet
of
the
old
woman
and
sobbed
aloud
what
is
it
darling
asked
the
old
crone
frightened
princess
what
is
it
i
have
hurt
my
wing
sobbed
psyche
and
she
showed
the
nurse
the
wrinkle
in
her
wing
which
was
not
yet
quite
gone
then
with
soothing
voice
and
wrinkled
hand
the
old
nurse
slowly
stroked
the
painful
wing
till
it
became
smooth
chapter
vi
the
old
king
assisted
by
pages
sat
down
slowly
on
his
throne
his
ministers
and
courtiers
gathered
round
him
then
there
was
a
great
rustling
of
satin
and
gold
and
in
came
emeralda
the
princess
royal
the
princess
of
the
jewel
as
her
title
ran
first
pages
and
then
she
herself
glittering
with
splendour
in
her
dress
of
silk
her
bosom
blazed
with
emeralds
a
tiara
of
emeralds
adorned
her
temples
her
tresses
intertwined
with
emeralds
fell
in
plaits
down
each
side
of
her
face
from
which
the
eyes
of
emerald
looked
proud
soulless
and
arrogant
bore
her
train
a
great
retinue
of
halberdiers
surrounded
her
jewelled
majesty
and
as
she
passed
along
the
trembling
courtiers
bowed
lower
to
her
than
they
did
to
the
king
because
they
were
in
deadly
fear
of
her
astra
with
dragging
step
followed
her
she
wore
a
dress
of
azure
covered
with
stars
a
white
mantle
full
of
stars
and
her
living
star
sparkled
in
her
hair
the
sages
of
the
country
surrounded
her
men
in
velvet
tabards
with
very
long
silver
beards
dim
eyes
and
wise
lips
the
two
princesses
sat
down
on
either
side
of
the
throne
and
for
a
moment
the
middle
space
of
the
hall
between
the
waiting
crowd
remained
empty
but
then
appeared
psyche
the
third
daughter
the
princess
of
nakedness
with
the
wings
shyly
she
approached
looking
right
and
left
with
the
laugh
of
a
child
she
was
naked
only
a
golden
veil
was
tied
in
a
fold
round
her
hips
her
wings
were
spread
out
like
a
butterfly
she
had
no
retinue
only
her
old
nurse
followed
her
and
she
was
so
pretty
and
charming
that
people
forgot
to
bow
as
she
passed
along
that
the
courtiers
smiled
and
whispered
full
of
admiration
because
she
was
so
beautiful
in
her
pure
chastity
slowly
she
walked
along
shy
and
laughing
a
little
then
close
to
the
throne
where
her
father
saw
her
approaching
hesitatingly
her
bare
foot
got
entangled
in
her
trailing
golden
veil
and
to
ascend
the
steps
she
lifted
it
up
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
king
hand
then
calmly
she
sat
down
on
a
cushion
at
his
feet
and
was
no
longer
shy
she
looked
round
inquisitively
and
nodded
a
greeting
here
and
there
child
as
she
was
till
all
at
once
to
the
right
of
the
throne
she
met
the
emerald
look
of
emeralda
and
started
and
shivered
a
cold
thrill
shot
through
her
limbs
and
she
hid
herself
in
the
ermine
of
her
father
mantle
to
be
safe
and
warm
then
there
was
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
at
the
door
of
the
hall
heralds
announced
prince
eros
the
youthful
monarch
of
the
present
he
came
in
all
alone
he
was
as
beautiful
as
a
god
with
hair
and
eyes
he
wore
a
white
suit
of
armour
over
a
silver
shirt
of
mail
and
his
whole
presence
portrayed
simplicity
and
intelligence
the
courtiers
were
astonished
at
his
coming
without
a
suite
emeralda
laughed
scornfully
aside
with
one
of
her
she
did
not
find
him
a
king
that
plain
youth
in
his
plain
dress
but
eros
had
now
approached
and
bowed
low
before
the
mighty
monarch
and
the
latter
bade
him
welcome
with
fatherly
condescension
then
spoke
the
prince

of
the
past

respectful
thanks

welcome

your
throne

horizon

in
illimitableness

country

garden

my
humble
palace

i

my
territory

majesty

lands

your
majesty
permit
me
to
kneel
and
pay
my
homage
to
you
as
an
obedient
vassal
then
the
old
king
nodded
to
psyche
and
the
princess
rose
because
eros
was
about
to
kneel
then
said
the
king
amiable
eros
i
love
you
as
a
son
tell
me
have
you
any
wish
that
i
can
satisfy
if
so
then
it
is
granted
you
then
said
eros
your
majesty
makes
my
heart
rejoice
by
saying
that
you
love
me
as
a
son
well
then
my
greatest
joy
would
be
to
marry
one
of
the
noble
princesses
who
are
your
majesty
daughters
but
i
am
a
poor
prince
and
whilst
confessing
to
your
majesty
my
bold
desire
i
fear
that
you
may
think
me
too
arrogant
in
presuming
to
cherish
a
wish
that
aims
so
high
noble
prince
said
the
king
you
are
poor
but
of
high
birth
and
divine
origin
higher
and
more
divine
than
we
you
are
descended
from
the
god
eros
we
from
his
beloved
psyche
the
history
of
the
gods
is
to
be
read
in
the
historical
rolls
of
our
kingdom
it
would
make
my
heart
rejoice
if
you
found
a
spouse
in
one
of
my
princesses
but
they
are
free
in
their
choice
and
you
will
have
to
win
their
love
permit
me
therefore
first
of
all
to
present
to
you
my
eldest
daughter
the
princess
royal
princess
of
the
jewel
emeralda
emeralda
rose
and
bowed
with
a
scornful
sneer
and
continued
the
monarch
in
the
second
place
to
my
wise
astra
princess
of
the
star
astra
rose
and
bowed
her
look
far
away
as
if
lost
in
contemplation
and
would
emeralda
permit
me
to
sue
for
her
love
and
her
hand
asked
the
prince
majesty
of
the
present
replied
emeralda
my
father
says
that
you
are
of
more
divine
origin
than
we
i
your
humble
slave
consider
it
therefore
too
great
an
honour
that
you
should
be
willing
to
raise
me
to
your
side
upon
your
throne
and
i
accept
your
homage
but
on
one
condition
that
condition
is
that
you
seek
for
me
the
jewel
jewel
of
mystery
the
name
of
which
may
not
be
uttered
the
noble
stone
of
supremacy
the
legends
respecting
this
jewel
are
innumerable
inexplicable
and
contradictory
but
the
jewel
exists
tell
me
ye
wise
men
of
the
land
tell
me
astra
my
sister
does
the
jewel
exist
it
exists
said
astra
it
exists
said
all
the
wise
men
after
her
it
exists
repeated
emeralda
prince
i
dare
ask
much
of
you
but
i
ask
you
the
greatest
thing
that
our
soul
and
ambition
can
think
of
if
you
find
me
beautiful
and
love
me
then
seek
and
bring
me
the
jewel
and
i
will
be
your
wife
and
together
we
shall
be
the
most
powerful
monarchs
in
the
world
the
prince
bowed
and
with
imperceptible
irony
said
royal
highness
of
the
jewel
your
words
breathe
the
splendour
of
yourself
and
i
will
weigh
them
in
my
mind
your
beauty
is
dazzling
and
to
reign
with
you
over
the
united
kingdoms
of
the
past
and
the
present
appears
to
me
indeed
a
divine
happiness
for
other
kingdoms
exist
not
added
astra
and
the
wise
men
repeated
her
words
yes
murmured
the
king
there
is
another
kingdom
what
kingdom
asked
all
the
kingdom
of
the
future
said
the
king
in
a
low
tone
emeralda
laughed
scornfully
astra
looked
compassionately
the
wise
men
glanced
at
each
other
the
courtiers
shook
their
heads
the
king
is
getting
old
they
whispered
the
mind
of
his
majesty
often
wanders
muttered
the
ministers
our
monarch
has
always
had
much
imagination
said
the
wise
men
he
is
a
poet
but
then
spoke
the
prince
and
you
wise
astra
royal
highness
of
the
star
will
you
like
emeralda
allow
me
to
sue
for
your
hand
and
heart
most
willingly
prince
eros
said
astra
with
a
look
and
in
a
vague
tone
but
i
have
conditions
to
make
as
well
as
emeralda
the
princess
royal
will
you
hear
them
then
listen
if
you
see
any
chance
of
lengthening
my
telescope
of
strengthening
the
lenses
that
i
can
see
through
them
to
the
confines
of
the
universe
to
the
last
to
the
mystic
rose
to
the
godhead
himself
then
i
will
be
your
wife
and
together
we
shall
be
the
most
powerful
beings
of
the
world
because
then
we
are
omniscient
for
the
universe
is
limited
the
universe
is
limited
said
the
wise
men
after
her
endless
is
the
universe
said
the
king
in
a
subdued
voice
the
people
laughed
and
shook
their
heads
the
king
is
getting
very
old
was
repeated
everywhere
the
king
will
soon
die
prophesied
the
wise
men
in
a
low
tone
he
speaks
like
an
old
man
without
reason
he
will
soon
die
royal
highness
of
the
star
said
the
prince
your
words
pregnant
with
wisdom
i
will
also
consider
for
to
be
omniscient
must
indeed
be
the
greatest
power
but
your
majesty
has
a
third
princess
he
continued
addressing
the
king
where
is
she
she
is
here
said
the
king
she
is
the
princess
of
nakedness
with
the
wings
but
she
is
still
a
child
prince
psyche
blushed
and
bowed
the
prince
looked
long
at
her
then
he
said
to
her
gently
your
highness
is
called
psyche
you
have
the
name
of
the
ancestress
of
your
race
as
i
have
the
name
of
the
god
who
begot
mine
is
it
not
true
i
believe
so
murmured
psyche
embarrassed
she
is
still
a
child
prince
forgive
her
repeated
the
king
will
your
majesty
not
permit
me
to
ask
for
the
hand
and
heart
of
your
third
daughter
the
princess
certainly
prince
but
she
is
still
so
young
if
she
leaves
me
i
shall
be
very
sad
but
if
she
loves
you
then
i
will
give
her
up
to
you
for
then
she
will
be
happy
tell
me
psyche
will
you
be
my
wife
psyche
blushed
exceedingly
her
naked
limbs
blushed
her
wings
blushed
prince
said
she
hesitatingly
and
looked
bashfully
at
her
father
you
do
me
much
honour
but
my
sisters
are
more
beautiful
and
wiser
than
i
and
my
father
would
miss
me
if
i
went
with
you
to
the
kingdom
of
the
present
but
tell
me
psyche
what
conditions
do
you
impose
upon
me
psyche
hesitated
she
was
about
to
exclaim
joyfully
catch
me
the
chimera
bind
him
in
a
meadow
to
graze
and
give
me
power
over
him
that
i
may
mount
his
back
and
fly
through
the
air
as
i
like
but
she
durst
not
before
the
whole
court
and
her
father
and
so
she
only
stammered
none
prince
could
you
love
me
i
do
know
prince
psyche
was
shy
she
kept
blushing
and
all
at
once
began
to
tremble
and
weep
and
she
looked
round
to
the
king
fled
to
his
arms
hid
her
face
in
his
beard
and
sobbed
prince
eros
said
the
king
forgive
her
you
see
she
is
a
child
seek
for
emeralda
jewel
or
seek
for
astra
the
glass
which
will
bring
to
view
the
confines
of
the
universe
but
leave
me
my
youngest
child
then
the
prince
bowed
an
indescribable
sadness
rose
in
his
soul
like
a
sea
and
pale
he
stammered
i
obey
your
majesty
then
the
king
descended
from
his
throne
and
embraced
the
prince
and
whilst
the
fanfares
sounded
he
put
his
arm
through
the
arm
of
eros
took
psyche
by
the
hand
and
conducted
his
guest
to
the
banquet
the
princesses
following
surrounded
by
the
whole
court
chapter
vii
for
days
had
psyche
watched
in
vain
and
all
hope
died
out
of
her
heart
but
one
windy
morning
the
thick
white
clouds
were
speeding
through
the
air
she
saw
the
desire
of
her
heart
again
far
away
appeared
a
cloud
but
as
it
drew
nearer
it
became
a
horse
it
was
the
chimera
she
beckoned
to
it
and
the
chimera
came
down
what
do
you
want
little
psyche
she
clasped
her
hands
imploringly
take
me
with
you
you
will
become
dizzy
no
no
he
descended
stamping
on
the
basalt
rock
the
terrace
shook
sparks
flew
up
and
the
steam
of
his
breath
shot
out
in
clouds
take
me
with
you
she
implored
where
do
you
wish
to
go
to
the
islands
of
opal
and
silver
they
are
too
far
away
take
me
then
nearer
to
them
take
me
with
you
where
you
will
are
you
not
afraid
no
will
you
hold
fast
to
my
neck
yes
oh
yes
come
then
she
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
he
bent
his
knees
and
she
got
up
with
a
beating
thumping
heart
between
his
flaming
wings
on
his
broad
broad
back
she
sat
almost
as
safe
as
in
a
nest
of
silver
feathers
trust
not
to
my
wings
he
warned
her
i
move
them
at
every
stroke
they
open
and
shut
open
and
shut
hold
fast
on
to
my
neck
clasp
my
mane
if
you
are
not
frightened
and
do
not
become
giddy
and
sick
you
will
not
fall
however
high
i
go
do
you
dare
psyche
yes
she
fastened
his
mane
round
her
waist
as
if
it
were
strong
rope
of
golden
flax
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
i
am
ready
she
said
courageously
he
ascended
very
slowly
with
his
broad
wings
under
him
under
her
the
terrace
sank
away
she
shut
her
eyes
she
held
her
breath
and
the
blood
left
her
heart
under
her
the
castle
sank
away
stop
she
implored
i
am
dying
i
thought
so
psyche
you
are
much
too
weak
you
can
not
go
up
with
me
she
opened
her
eyes
slightly
she
sat
on
his
back
in
the
silver
down
where
his
quills
clave
to
his
loins
and
round
her
circles
of
light
revolved
one
after
the
other
and
made
her
dizzy
descend
she
implored
oh
descend
i
can
not
endure
it
i
have
no
breath
i
am
dying
he
descended
he
stood
on
the
terrace
she
slid
along
his
wing
to
the
ground
she
put
her
hands
before
her
face
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
was
alone
then
she
was
very
very
sad
but
next
day
he
appeared
again
and
more
courageous
she
wished
to
mount
him
again
he
let
her
do
as
she
desired
and
she
got
on
his
back
she
shut
her
eyes
but
smiled
he
went
higher
and
higher
with
her
without
her
saying
descend
she
travelled
for
a
time
high
up
in
the
air
she
opened
her
eyes
and
kept
smiling
she
got
accustomed
to
the
rarefied
air
the
third
time
he
soared
away
with
her
she
saw
far
below
the
royal
castle
small
as
a
toy
towers
ramparts
and
then
she
realised
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
left
the
castle
she
thought
of
the
king
take
me
back
she
said
to
the
horse
commandingly
he
obeyed
her
he
took
her
back
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
she
longed
again
for
him
and
the
lofty
air
and
she
had
but
one
thought
the
chimera
she
no
longer
cared
for
the
flowers
which
she
had
planted
between
the
walls
and
the
flowers
withered
she
no
longer
cared
for
the
swans
and
the
swans
neglected
followed
her
in
vain
in
the
green
moats
she
forgot
to
crumble
bread
for
them
and
she
looked
at
the
clouds
and
she
gazed
at
the
wind
thinking
only
of
him
the
horse
with
the
silver
wings
because
he
came
on
the
wind
on
the
clouds
which
thundered
when
he
struck
with
his
hoofs
on
the
day
that
he
did
not
come
her
fair
chimera
she
sat
pale
and
lonely
gazing
from
the
battlements
her
eyes
far
away
her
arms
round
her
knees
in
the
evening
she
nestled
in
the
king
beard
in
the
folds
of
his
tabard
but
she
durst
not
tell
him
that
she
had
ridden
a
wondrous
winged
horse
and
flown
with
him
through
the
air
but
on
the
days
that
her
beloved
horse
had
come
and
taken
her
away
with
him
carefully
flapping
his
wings
her
face
shone
with
golden
happiness
in
the
apotheosis
of
her
soul
and
through
the
gloomy
halls
where
sacred
spiders
which
were
never
disturbed
wove
their
webs
rang
high
voice
and
from
the
faded
gobelin
the
low
vault
and
the
motionless
iron
knights
strangely
the
words
of
her
joyous
song
chapter
viii
psyche
where
do
you
wish
to
go
to
the
opal
islands
to
the
seas
of
light
to
the
luminous
streaks
take
a
deep
breath
hold
fast
on
to
my
neck
twist
my
mane
more
tightly
round
your
hand
then
we
will
begin
our
journey
the
clouds
sent
forth
a
rumbling
sound
of
thunder
the
hoofs
shot
fire
his
wings
expanded
and
shut
and
his
strong
feathers
rustled
in
the
air
psyche
uttered
a
cry
she
had
ascended
higher
than
ever
before
and
under
them
sank
away
the
castle
the
meadows
the
woods
the
cities
and
the
river
under
them
like
a
map
lay
stretched
out
province
after
province
desert
after
desert
the
whole
kingdom
of
the
past
how
great
it
was
how
great
it
was
the
frontiers
receded
from
view
again
and
again
far
down
below
rose
up
town
after
town
river
after
river
meandered
along
rose
up
one
after
the
other
now
only
slightly
elevated
then
rising
arabesquely
through
the
plains
then
there
were
great
waters
like
oceans
and
psyche
saw
nothing
but
white
foaming
sea
but
on
the
other
side
of
it
began
again
the
strand
the
land
the
wood
the
meadows
the
mountains
and
so
on
endlessly
how
much
farther
away
are
the
opal
islands
the
streaks
of
light
i
see
in
the
distance
my
beloved
chimera
we
have
already
passed
them
she
raised
her
head
bent
over
his
streaming
neck
and
gazed
about
her
but
i
do
not
see
them
any
longer
she
said
astonished
i
see
wood
and
meadow
towns
and
mountains
is
the
world
then
the
same
everywhere
where
are
the
opal
islands
behind
us
but
i
do
not
see
them
have
we
passed
them
without
my
seeing
them
o
naughty
chimera
you
did
not
tell
me
and
where
are
the
luminous
streaks
of
the
land
we
are
going
through
them
i
see
nothing
below
land
around
clouds
as
everywhere
but
no
lands
of
light
and
yet
there
in
the
distance
very
far
away
what
is
that
chimera
i
see
as
it
were
a
purple
desert
on
a
sea
of
golden
water
with
winding
borders
of
soft
in
the
desert
are
oases
like
pale
emerald
palms
with
silvery
waving
tops
azure
bananas
and
over
the
purple
desert
trills
ether
of
light
crimson
with
streaks
of
topaz
chimera
chimera
what
is
that
country
what
is
that
beautiful
country
the
golden
sea
with
its
foam
forms
a
pearly
fringe
along
the
shore
the
palms
wave
their
tops
to
a
rhythm
of
aerial
music
and
the
bananas
blue
pink
glow
in
the
ether
till
all
is
light

are
approaching
the
shore

with
soft
the
sea

a
dirty
green
like
an
ordinary
sea
the
borders
are
sand
you

me
away
through

everything
beautiful

see
disappears
from
my
view
but
yet
there
behind
the
horizon
behind
the
sand
of
the
desert
is
a
dazzling
scene
are
those
silver
grottos
on
a
sea
of
light

an
icy
coldness
in
the
air
o
chimera
take
me
back
he
turned
with
a
swing
of
his
powerful
wings
and
as
he
turned
the
lightning
broke
forth
and
darted
zigzag
through
the
air
like
electric
swords
the
black
clouds
parted
asunder
with
a
violent
peal
of
thunder
like
the
clapping
of
cymbals
a
storm
of
wind
arose
the
rain
fell
down
in
torrents
o
chimera
take
me
back
she
threw
herself
on
to
his
neck
she
hid
her
face
in
his
mane
and
through
the
bursting
storm
whilst
at
every
blow
of
his
hoofs
it
lightened
round
them
he
winged
his
way
back
with
her
to
her
country
the
kingdom
of
the
past
inky
there
in
the
inky
night
chapter
ix
the
old
king
was
dead
black
flags
hung
from
the
three
hundred
towers
and
cast
their
dark
shadows
below
a
dim
light
fell
through
the
into
the
castle
for
the
three
hundred
flags
obscured
the
sun
with
funeral
music
that
made
the
heart
feel
sad
the
procession
with
long
flickering
torches
followed
the
king
coffin
down
the
steps
to
the
deep
vaults
below
the
priests
in
black
prayed
in
latin
the
court
in
black
sang
the
litany
and
the
princesses
in
black
sang
alternately
a
long
latin
sentence
behind
the
coffin
walked
first
emeralda
behind
her
astra
her
sister
and
then
little
psyche
wrapped
in
her
black
veil
emeralda
sang
with
a
voice
of
crystal
astra
distracted
was
too
late
in
answering
and
psyche
voice
trembled
when
she
had
to
sing
alone
the
long
monotonous
sentence
there
in
the
deepest
vault
they
placed
the
coffin
next
to
the
coffin
of
the
king
father
and
kneeling
round
it
they
prayed
the
low
roman
vaults
receded
in
impenetrable
darkness
they
sang
and
prayed
the
whole
day
and
psyche
was
very
tired
and
whilst
she
was
kneeling
her
little
knees
quite
stiff
she
fell
asleep
against
the
coffin
of
her
father
her
last
thought
had
been
to
kiss
the
dear
old
face
for
the
last
time
but
she
felt
nothing
but
the
goldsmith
work
and
the
great
round
jewels
that
were
in
it
hurt
her
head
then
she
fell
asleep
and
when
the
court
had
prayed
and
all
went
up
the
steps
again
there
above
to
do
homage
to
emeralda
as
queen
of
the
kingdom
of
the
past
they
all
forgot
psyche
long
long
she
slept
and
when
she
awoke
she
did
not
know
at
first
where
she
was
then
by
the
light
of
the
long
torches
she
espied
the
coffin
and
through
the
crystal
of
the
sarcophagus
she
saw
the
dead
face
of
the
king
and
pressed
a
kiss
upon
the
glass
dear
father
she
whispered
trembling
why
have
you
gone
i
am
now
quite
alone
of
emeralda
i
am
afraid
and
astra
does
not
think
of
me
she
only
thinks
of
the
stars
father
dear
forgive
me
i
have
deceived
you
i
have
travelled
through
the
air
on
the
back
of
the
flying
horse
but
father

the
horse
is
beautiful
and
i
love
the
chimera
o
father

deceived
you
and

nobody

for
me
you

dead
father
and
embalmed
and
shut
up
in
gold
and
crystal
and
jewels
and
do

little
psyche
you
do
not
think
of
your
little
daughter
alone

the
castle

high
up
in
the
air
i
have
never

wandered
o

leave
the
castle

the
world
and

but
emeralda
is
powerful
and
i
am
afraid
of
her
if
i
remain
she
will
drive
me
away
with
her
look
and
shut
me
up
all
my
life
and
my
wings
i
shall
break
against
the
unbreakable
lattice

great
unsafe
world

o
father
farewell
farewell
and
forever
she
rose
she
shivered
the
dark
vaults
receded
more
and
more
by
the
light
of
the
long
torches
she
saw
the
sacred
spiders
which
wove
web
after
web
they
were
never
disturbed
sacred
spider
said
psyche
to
a
big
fat
one
with
a
cross
on
its
back
tell
me
where
i
must
go
you
can
not
flee
replied
the
spider
high
up
in
the
dark
vault
in
the
middle
of
its
web
everything
is
as
it
is
everything
becomes
as
it
was
happens
as
it
happens
all
goes
to
dust
every
day
sinks
into
the
deep
vaults
of
the
dark
pits
under
us
under
us
everything
becomes
the
past
and
everything
comes
into
the
power
of
emeralda
as
soon
as
anything
is
it
has
been
and
is
in
the
power
of
emeralda
seek
not
to
flee
that
is
vanity
submit
to
your
lot
the
best
thing
is
that
you
become
one
of
us
a
sacred
spider
and
weave
your
web
for
our
web
is
sacred
our
web
is
indisturbable
and
with
all
our
webs
one
for
the
other
we
serve
the
princess
and
protect
her
treasures
the
treasures
of
the
past
which
behind
our
weaving
go
to
dust
but
if
they
go
to
dust
of
what
value
are
they
foolish
child
dust
is
everything
the
past
is
dust
remembrance
is
dust
everything
becomes
dust
love
jewels
all
becomes
dust
and
the
sacred
dust
we
watch
over
behind
our
webs
become
a
spider
like
us
weave
your
web
and
be
wise
but
i
live
i
am
young
i
desire
i
love
and
i
can
not
bury
myself
in
dust
oh
tell
me
whither
i
must
flee
the
spider
laughed
scornfully
and
moved
its
eight
legs
with
great
impatience
ask
me
not
about
the
places
of
the
world
the
regions
of
the
wind
i
sit
here
and
spin
i
am
holy
i
watch
over
the
treasure
of
the
throne
disturb
me
no
more
with
your
frivolity
and
let
not
your
wings
get
entangled
in
the
rays
of
my
web
although
you
are
not
a
moth
but
princess
of
the
kingdom
of
the
past
psyche
was
frightened
the
spider
reverenced
her
because
she
was
a
princess
but
coveted
with
his
wicked
instinct
and
she
drew
back
she
cast
a
last
look
at
the
dead
face
of
her
father
and
fled
up
the
hundred
steps
in
every
corner
sat
the
sacred
spiders
and
moved
their
legs
shuddering
she
fled
on
whither
she
thought
of
her
love
the
chimera
but
nowhere
could
he
be
with
her
for
ever
she
glided
with
him
through
the
air
and
he
brought
her
back
to
the
castle
his
lot
was
to
fly
restlessly
through
the
air
oh
were
she
but
a
chimera
like
him
had
she
but
two
strong
wings
instead
of
princesses
wings
she
would
have
gone
with
him
everywhere
whither
above
from
the
came
the
sounds
of
joyful
music
there
emeralda
was
being
crowned
whither
she
fled
to
the
terrace
oh
if
emeralda
missed
her
how
angry
she
would
be
she
would
think
that
psyche
refused
to
do
her
homage
she
could
never
return
farewell
flowers
swans
doves
the
three
hundred
flags
obscured
the
light
she
would
never
be
able
to
see
the
chimera
coming
oh
if
he
came
and
she
did
not
see
him
and
did
not
beckon
to
him
and
he
flew
past
he
was
her
only
safety
if
needs
be
she
would
wait
for
days
together
on
the
battlements
but
if
emeralda
sent
to
search
for
her
oh
if
she
did
then
there
was
the
cataract
then
she
would
throw
herself
headlong
down
for
ever
for
ever
into
the
rushing
water
with
its
rainbow
colours
a
wind
arose
that
was
the
wind
that
brought
her
beloved
the
flags
flapped
and
impeded
her
view
and
although
she
saw
nothing
she
beckoned
as
in
despair
and
called
out
chimera

with
her
the
whole
day
the
sun

the
stars
glistened
in
the
dark
firmament
and
he
flew
back
again
they
approached
the
castle
the
day
began
to
dawn
fly
past
she
entreated
he
flew
on
under
her
she
could
just
see
the
castle
small
as
a
toy
the
three
hundred
towers
where
green
flags
now
fluttered
because
emeralda
reigned
he
flew
on
chimera
she
cried
i

you
you
are
the
most
beautiful
most
glorious
creature
that
i
have
ever
beheld
safe
i
lie
upon
your

arms
round
your
neck

i
am
tired
i

me
down
somewhere

with
me
in
a
beautiful
valley
amongst
flowers
near
a
brook

you
not
thirsty

you
not
tired
and

graze
and
lie
in
a
meadow

love
you
so
but
why
this
restless
flying
from

must
do
it
little
psyche
chimera
descend
somewhere
stay
somewhere
with
me
i

tired
i
am
cold
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
on
a
bed
of
moss
under
the
shade
of
trees
sleep
there
with
me
i
can
not
my
lot
is
to
fly
through
the
air
apparently
without
an
object
but
yet
with
an
object
and
what
that
is
i
do
not
know
but
what
then
does
the
power
want
you
fly
through
the
air
the
spider

over
dust
everything
is
as
it
is
oh
life
is
comfortless
chimera
i
can
hold
out
no
longer
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
but
if
you
do
not
descend
then
i
will
loose
the
knots
of
your
mane
i
will
let
go
my
arms
that
are
so
tired
and
then
i
shall
fall
down
into
nothingness
hold
out
a
little
longer
yonder
is
the
purple
desert
oh
that
is
beautiful
she
exclaimed
but
you
fly
past
it
always
past
it
do
you
want
to
rest
psyche
oh
yes
then
i
will
descend
hold
out
a
little
longer
she
held
him
tight
and
looked
about
he
plied
his
wings
with
a
rapidity
that
made
her
dizzy
they
blew
a
wind
round
psyche
in
the
air
there
loomed
the
purple
sands
on
the
golden
sea
with
a
pearly
border
of
foam
the
azure
bananas
which
waved
their
tops
in
the
ether
psyche
held
her
breath
would
he
descend
there
yes
indeed
he
was
descending
he
was
descending
the
purple
she
thought
grew
pale
as
soon
as
he
descended
the
sea
was
no
longer
golden
the
foliage
no
longer
blue
but
yet
yet
it
was
beautiful
a
an
enchanted
land
and
he
was
descending
with
his
broad
wings
he
glided
down
now
he
stood
still
snorting
his
breath
in
a
cloud
of
steam
she
glided
gently
down
his
back
on
to
the
sand
and
laughed
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
rest
now
here
psyche
said
he
dejectedly
and
the
quiver
in
his
voice
startled
her
she
laughed
no
more
rest
now
look
here
are
dates
and
there
is
a
spring
the
soft
violet
night
is
rapidly
spreading
over
the
sky
and
cooling
the
too
warm
air
a
few
pale
stars
are
already
glistening
now
quench
your
thirst
now
refresh
yourself
and
rest
this
is
a
pleasant
oasis
now
sleep
little
psyche
will
soon
be
here
farewell
she
looked
at
him
with
wondering
eyes
she
threw
herself
on
his
broad
powerful
heaving
breast
and
round
his
arched
neck
she
threw
her
trembling
arms
what
what
do
you
say
chimera
she
asked
pale
with
fear
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
do
you
mean
surely
you
will
rest
here
with
me
in
the
soft
violet
night
and
amongst
the
blue
flowers
with
me
you
will
refresh
yourself
with
dates
and
water
you
will
let
me
sleep
in
the
shadow
of
your
wings
and
watch
over
me
during
the
dreadful
night
no
little
psyche
i
am
going
farther
and
farther
and
then
i
will
return
then
after
weeks
after
months
perhaps
you
will
see
me
again
in
the
air
you
will
forsake
me
here
in
the
desert
take
courage
little
psyche
you
are
now
too
tired
to
fly
farther
with
me
through
the
air
you
would
slip
from
my
back
and
fall
into
nothingness
here
is
a
pleasant
oasis
here
are
dates
and
a
murmuring
stream
she
uttered
a
cry
her
sobs
choked
her
she
uttered
a
second
which
frightened
the
hyenas
far
away
in
the
desert
and
made
them
prick
up
their
ears
she
uttered
a
third
which
rent
the
and
the
stars
quivered
from
sympathy
alone
she
cried
and
wrung
her
hands
alone
o
chimera
you
will
leave
me
alone
with
dates
and
brook
and
i
thought
and
still
hoped
that
you
would
stay
with
me
king
in
your
country
of
the
rainbow
alone
you
will
leave
me
alone
in
a
sandy
desert
in
nothing
but
sand
sand
in
the
night
with
a
single
tree
and
a
handful
of
water
alone
o
chimera
you
can
not
do
that
for
i
love
you
i
adore
you
with
all
my
soul
and
shall
die
of
grief
and
tears
chimera
if
you
fly
away
from
me
i
love
you
i
worship
your
golden
eyes
your
voice
of
bronze
your
steaming
breath
your
panting
flanks
your
mane
to
which
i
bound
myself
your
flaming
wings
which
carried
me
far
farther
and
farther
to
this
place
o
chimera
lay
down
your
smoking
limbs
in
the
shadow
of
the
night
lay
your
noble
head
in
my
arms
and
my
bosom
and
together
we
will
rest
and
fly
away
farther
united
forever
i
can
not
o
little
psyche
i
too
love
you
sweet
burden
which
lay
between
my
wings
little
butterfly
with
weak
wings
that
lent
strength
to
my
flight
but
now
but
now
o
chimera
but
now
but
now
i
must
go
continue
my
lonely
journey
to
and
fro
without
knowing
why
farewell
little
psyche
hope
in
life
hope
in
the
morrow
he
spread
his
wings
his
limbs
quivered
he
ascended
into
the
air
she
wrung
her
arms
her
hands
she
sobbed
she
sobbed
have
pity
she
implored
pity
pity
what
have
i

me
so

god

done

have
trusted

my
soul
in
happiness

and

and

i
ask
he
no
longer

what

i
care
for
the
problems
of
life
him
i
love
and
in
me
is
nothing
but
my
love
and
despair
and
round
me
is
the
desert
and
the
night
and
now
now
i
must
die
she
sobbed
and
her
tears
flowed
she
was
alone
around
her
loomed
the
night
around
her
stretched
the
sands
as
far
as
the
perceptible
horizon
and
above
her
glistened
the
stars
and
she
wept
her
grief
was
too
great
for
her
little
soul
she
wept
alone
she
sobbed
alone
i
will
not
quench
my
thirst
i
will
not
refresh
myself
nor
will
i
sleep
i
am
tired
but
i
will
go
on
on
she
went
and
wept
in
the
night
she
walked
on
through
the
sand
and
she
wept
she
wept
from
fear
and
despair
and
she
wept
so
her
tears
flowed
so
many
down
her
cheeks
that
they
fell
her
tears
like
drops
great
and
warm
deep
into
the
sand
her
tears
flowed
down
into
the
sand
and
she
wept
she
kept
weeping
and
as
she
went
along
her
tears
did
not
stop
then
in
the
sand
her
tears
so
warm
and
so
great
formed
little
lakes
and
as
she
went
and
kept
going
on
and
weeping
the
little
lakes
flowed
into
one
another
and
behind
her
flowed
a
stream
of
tears
meandering
after
her
flowed
her
tears
and
on
she
went
in
the
night
and
wept
after
her
meandered
faithfully
the
stream
of
her
tears
and
she
thought
of
her
lost
happiness
he
had
forsaken
her
why
she
had
loved
him
so
still
loved
him
so
oh
she
would
always
love
him
so
always
always
and
in
her
love
she
did
not
scold
him
for
she
loved
him
and
scolded
not
she
longed
for
no
revenge
for
she
loved
him
that
was
fate
she
thought
weeping
he
could
not
do
anything
else
he
was
obliged
she
wept
and
oh
she
was
so
tired
so
tired
of
the
wide
sky
so
tired
of
the
wide
sand
then
she
thought
she
could
go
no
farther
and
should
fall
into
the
stream
of
her
tears
but
before
her
a
lofty
shadow
fell
with
gloomy
darkness
on
the
violet
night
she
looked
up
and
had
to
strain
her
neck
to
see
to
the
top
of
the
shadow
the
shadow
was
round
above
and
then
tapered
off
behind
but
she
wept
so
that
she
did
not
see
then
with
her
hand
she
wiped
away
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
gazed
the
shadow
was
awful
like
that
of
an
awfully
great
beast
and
she
kept
wiping
away
her
tears
which
formed
a
pool
around
her
and
gazed
then
she
saw
she
saw
squatting
in
the
sand
a
terribly
great
beast
like
a
lion
immovable
the
beast
was
as
great
as
a
castle
high
as
a
tower
its
head
reached
to
the
stars
but
its
head
was
the
head
of
a
woman
slender
enveloped
in
a
basalt
veil
which
fell
down
right
and
left
along
her
shoulders
and
the
woman
head
stood
on
the
breast
of
a
woman
two
breasts
of
a
gigantic
woman
of
basalt
but
the
body
that
squatted
down
in
the
sand
was
a
lion
and
the
forepaws
protruded
like
walls
the
night
shone
the
sultry
night
shone
with
diamonds
over
the
horizonless
desert
and
in
the
starlight
night
the
beast
terrible
rested
there
squatting
in
the
sand
its
paws
extended
and
its
breasts
and
woman
head
protruding
gigantic
reaching
to
the
stars
her
basalt
eyes
stared
straight
before
her
her
mouth
was
shut
and
so
were
the
basalt
lips
which
would
never
speak
psyche
stood
before
the
beast
around
her
was
the
night
around
her
was
the
sand
above
her
the
diamond
shining
stars
silently
shuddering
and
full
of
awe
stood
psyche
then
she
thought
it
must
be
she
the
sphinx
she
wept
her
tears
flowed
she
stood
in
the
stream
of
her
tears
which
winding
along
followed
her
and
weeping
she
lifted
up
her
voice
small
in
the
night
the
voice
of
a
child
that
speaks
in
the
illimitable
awful
sphinx
she
said
make
me
wise
you
know
the
problem
of
life
i
pray
you
solve
it
to
me
and
let
me
no
longer
weep
the
sphinx
was
silent
sphinx
continued
psyche
open
your
stony
lips
speak
tell
me
the
riddle
of
life
i
was
born
a
princess
naked
with
wings
i
can
not
fly
the
chimera
the
splendid
horse
with
the
silver
wings
came
down
to
me
took
me
away
with
him
in
wanderings
through
the
air
and
i
loved
him
he
has
left
me
me
a
child
alone
in
the
desert
alone
in
the
night
tell
me
why
if
i
know
i
shall
perhaps
weep
no
more
sphinx
i
am
tired
i
am
tired
of
the
air
tired
of
the
sand
tired
from
crying
and
i
can
not
stop
i
keep
on
crying
if
you
do
not
speak
to
me
sphinx
then
i
will
drown
you
gigantic
as
you
are
in
my
tears
look
at
them
flowing
around
me
look
at
them
rippling
at
your
feet
like
a
sea
sphinx
they
will
rise
above
your
head
sphinx
speak
the
sphinx
was
silent
the
sphinx
with
stony
eyes
looked
away
into
the
night
of
diamond
stars
her
basalt
lips
remained
closed
and
psyche
wept
then
she
cast
a
look
at
the
stars
sacred
stars
she
murmured
i
am
alone
my
father
is
dead
the
chimera
has
gone
the
sphinx
is
silent
i
am
alone
and
afraid
and
tired
sacred
stars
watch
over
me
see
my
tears
no
longer
flow
for
this
night
they
are
exhausted
i
can
cry
no
more
i
will
go
to
sleep
here
between
the
feet
of
the
sphinx
she
speaks
not
it
is
true
but
perhaps
she
is
not
angry
and
if
she
wants
to
crush
me
with
her
foot
i
care
not
but
yet
i
will
go
to
sleep
between
her
powerful
feet
in
your
looks
of
living
diamond
i
feel
compassion
thrill
sacred
stars
i
will
go
to
sleep
watch
over
me
she
lay
down
between
the
feet
of
the
sphinx
against
the
breast
of
the
sphinx
and
she
was
so
little
and
the
sphinx
so
great
that
she
was
like
a
butterfly
sitting
near
a
tower
then
she
fell
asleep
the
night
was
very
still
far
far
away
in
the
boundless
desert
a
mist
drifted
horizonlessly
along
and
lit
up
the
darkness
the
stream
of
psyche
tears
meandered
like
a
silver
thread
far
away
from
whence
she
had
come
she
herself
slept
the
sphinx
with
staring
eyes
and
closed
mouth
looked
out
high
into
the
night
the
stars
twinkled
and
watched
chapter
xi
without
a
cloud
arose
on
the
horizon
the
first
dawn
of
day
the
round
morning
glimmer
and
in
the
dawn
appeared
the
horizon
and
bordered
the
sandy
plain
in
the
rosy
light
gigantic
towered
the
gloomy
sphinx
psyche
slept
but
through
her
weary
eyelids
the
light
softly
sent
its
rays
and
suddenly
she
awoke
she
opened
her
eyes
but
did
not
move
she
remained
in
her
slumbering
attitude
but
her
eyes
looked
about
she
saw
the
desert
without
an
oasis
only
the
brooklet
of
tears
that
meandered
far
away
from
whence
she
had
come
it
was
like
a
silver
thread
in
the
rosy
light
of
the
dawn
and
she
followed
its
windings
with
her
eye
as
long
as
she
could
and
when
she
thus
looked
she
began
to
weep
again
the
tears
fell
on
the
feet
of
the
sphinx
and
psyche
wept
in
her
slumbering
position
there
was
a
mist
before
her
eyes
and
through
the
mist
glimmered
the
rosy
desert
and
the
little
glistening
stream
but
now
she
wiped
away
her
tears
which
trickled
through
her
fingers
for
she
thought
she
saw
and
that
was
so
improbable
she
wiped
her
eyes
again
and
saw
she
thought
she
saw
and
it
was
so
improbable
but
yet
it
was
so
she
saw
she
saw
someone
coming
along
every
winding
of
the
brook
she
saw
someone
approaching
who
was
it
coming
there
she
knew
not
he
came
nearer
and
nearer
was
she
dreaming
no
she
was
awake
he
came
whoever
he
was
he
was
approaching
she
remained
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
and
he
came
nearer
and
nearer
following
the
briny
track
till
he
stood
before
the
sphinx
the
sphinx
was
so
great
and
psyche
so
little
that
at
first
he
did
not
see
her
but
because
she
was
so
white
with
crimson
wings
he
saw
her
a
little
thing
red
and
white
he
approached
between
the
feet
of
the
sphinx
till
he
stood
right
before
her
he
approached
reverentially
because
she
had
wept
so
much
when
he
was
quite
close
he
knelt
down
and
folded
his
hands
through
her
tears
she
did
not
recognise
him
who
are
you
she
asked
in
a
faint
voice
he
stood
up
and
approached
still
closer
and
then
she
recognised
him
he
was
prince
eros
the
king
of
the
present
i
know
who
you
are
said
psyche
you
are
prince
eros
who
was
to
have
married
emeralda
or
astra
he
smiled
and
she
said
why
do
you
come
here
in
the
desert
are
you
seeking
here
for
the
jewel
or
the
glass
that
magnifies
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
no
psyche
he
said
gently
i
have
never
sought
for
the
jewel
nor
for
the
glass
but
first
tell
me
why
are
you
here
and
sleeping
by
the
sphinx
she
told
him
she
spoke
of
her
father
who
was
dead
of
the
chimera
of
the
purple
desert
and
the
sorrowful
night
she
told
him
of
her
tears
i
have
followed
them
o
psyche
he
replied
i
have
come
ever
since
i
saw
you
before
your
father
throne
a
day
never
to
be
forgotten
i
have
come
here
every
day
every
day
i
leave
my
garden
of
the
present
to
ask
the
awful
sphinx
for
the
solution
of
my
problem
what
problem
prince
eros
the
problem
of
my
grief
for
i
am
grieved
about
you
psyche
because
you
would
not
follow
me
and
stayed
with
your
father
now
i
know
why
you
loved
the
chimera
she
blushed
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
who
could
see
the
chimera
and
not
love
him
more
than
me
said
eros
gently
who
could
love
him
and
not
weep
over
him
he
whispered
still
more
gently
but
she
did
not
hear
him
then
he
spoke
louder
every
morning
psyche
i
come
to
ask
the
sphinx
how
long
i
must
still
suffer
and
why
i
must
suffer
and
still
much
more
o
psyche
i
ask
the
sphinx
that
i
will
not
tell
you
now
because
because
because
it
would
perhaps
pain
you
to
hear
the
question
of
my
heart
so
i
came
now
o
psyche
and
then
i
espied
a
brooklet
meandering
through
the
sand
i
did
not
know
it
i
was
thirsty
for
i
am
always
thirsty
i
stooped
down
and
scooped
up
the
clear
water
in
my
hand
it
tasted
salt
psyche
they
were
tears
my
tears
she
said
and
wept
psyche
i
drank
them
tell
me
do
you
forgive
me
for
that
yes
i
followed
the
brook
and
now
i
have
found
you
here
she
was
silent
she
looked
at
him
he
knelt
down
by
her
psyche
said
he
gently
i
love
you
because
i
saw
you
little
and
naked
and
winged
standing
amongst
your
proud
sisters
psyche
i
love
you
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
would
weep
all
your
tears
for
you
and
would
give
you
the
chimera
you
ca
do
that
she
said
sadly
no
psyche
answered
he
that
can
not
alas
be
done
i
can
only
weep
for
myself
and
the
chimera
nobody
can
catch
him
he
flies
too
fast
she
said
and
he
is
much
too
strong
but
it
is
very
kind
of
you
prince
eros
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
he
kissed
it
reverentially
then
he
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
psyche
said
he
gently
will
the
sphinx
give
me
an
answer
to
my
question
this
morning
she
cast
down
her
eyes
psyche
he
went
on
i
have
drunk
your
tears
i
respect
your
grief
too
great
for
your
little
heart
but
may
i
suffer
it
with
you
o
psyche
little
psyche
little
in
the
great
desert
now
your
father
is
dead
now
the
chimera
is
away
now
you
are
all
alone
o
psyche
now
come
with
me
oh
let
me
now
love
you
o
psyche
come
now
with
me
psyche
alone
in
the
desert
a
little
butterfly
in
a
sandy
plain
psyche
oh
come
with
me
i
will
give
you
a
to
live
in
a
garden
to
play
in
and
all
my
love
to
comfort
you
despise
them
all
that
i
have
will
i
give
small
is
my
palace
and
small
my
garden
round
it
but
greater
than
the
desert
and
the
sky
is
my
great
love
o
psyche
come
with
me
now
then
you
will
suffer
cold
and
hunger
and
thirst
no
more
and
the
grief
that
your
heart
now
suffers
psyche
we
will
bear
together
he
stretched
out
his
arms
she
smiled
tired
and
pale
from
weeping
slid
from
the
foot
of
the
sphinx
and
nestled
to
his
heart
eros
she
murmured
i
suffer
i
pine
i
weep
i
gave
away
all
that
i
had
i
have
nothing
more
than
my
grief
can
grief
be
happiness
in
the
present
he
smiled
from
grief
comes
happiness
he
answered
from
grief
will
come
happiness
not
in
the
present
but
in
the
future
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
what
is
that
she
asked
future
it
is
a
very
sweet
word
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
but
i
have
heard
it
before
father
sometimes
spoke
of
it
with
an
affected
voice
it
seems
to
be
something
far
away
far
far
away
from
grief
will
come
in
the
future
happiness
far
behind
me
lies
the
past
then
i
was
a
child
now
i
am
a
woman
a
woman
now
i
am
eros
a
woman
a
woman
who
has
wept
and
suffered
and
asked
of
the
silent
sphinx
now
i
am
no
longer
a
princess
but
a
woman
a
queen
of
the
present
she
fell
against
his
shoulder
and
fainted
he
gave
a
sign
and
out
of
the
air
flew
a
glittering
golden
chariot
drawn
by
two
panting
griffons
he
lifted
her
into
the
chariot
he
held
her
tight
in
his
arm
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
with
his
other
hand
he
guided
his
two
lions
through
the
glowing
air
of
the
desert
chapter
xii
when
psyche
opened
her
eyes
she
heard
the
soft
music
of
two
pipes
and
she
awoke
from
her
swoon
with
a
smile
she
lay
still
and
did
not
move
but
looked
about
her
she
was
reclining
upon
a
soft
bed
of
purple
on
a
couch
of
ivory
she
lay
in
a
crystal
palace
round
the
palace
were
pillars
of
crystal
and
a
round
crystal
gallery
the
pillars
were
entwined
with
roses
yellow
white
and
pink
and
they
perfumed
the
sunny
spring
morning
through
the
gallery
of
pillars
through
the
walls
of
crystal
she
saw
round
her
a
pleasant
meadow
like
a
round
valley
a
valley
like
a
garden
through
which
ran
a
murmuring
brook
between
beds
of
flowers
quite
near
appeared
the
horizon
of
a
low
and
the
cloudless
sky
was
like
a
chalice
of
turquoise
the
pipes
changed
their
music
psyche
raised
herself
a
little
higher
leaning
on
her
arm
she
laughed
and
looked
about
in
the
middle
of
the
crystal
palace
was
a
basin
of
white
marble
full
of
water
and
doves
were
hopping
about
it
or
drinking
sitting
at
the
gate
of
crystal
pillars
psyche
saw
two
girls
with
their
fingers
they
raised
the
flutes
to
their
mouth
and
played
psyche
laughed
and
listened
then
she
fell
back
on
the
bed
again
happy
but
tired
full
of
rest
and
contentment
and
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
up
through
a
curtain
fell
the
tempered
spring
sunshine
quiet
and
soft
joyous
and
still
psyche
breathed
more
freely
and
a
sigh
escaped
from
her
heart
she
put
her
arms
under
her
head
her
wings
lay
stretched
out
right
and
left
on
either
side
of
her
and
when
she
heard
the
music
of
the
flutes
her
thoughts
drifted
away
like
an
aimless
dream
like
upon
water
she
dreamed
and
she
listened
she
no
longer
felt
tired
and
her
eyes
which
had
shed
a
brook
of
tears
felt
moist
and
fresh
cooled
by
an
invisible
hand
with
invisible
care
her
breathing
was
regular
and
her
soul
felt
safe
and
she
smiled
continually
the
pipes
ceased
playing
the
two
girls
seeing
that
the
queen
had
awaked
rose
up
and
approached
her
bed
with
a
basket
of
fruit
which
they
set
down
near
her
then
they
made
a
deep
reverence
but
spoke
not
and
sat
down
again
by
the
pillars
and
blew
their
pipes
anew
but
to
another
tune
somewhat
louder
like
a
voice
calling
and
both
in
unison
the
pipes
sounded
jubilant
in
the
morning
and
outside
high
in
the
air
the
lark
answered
joyously
psyche
smiled
stretched
out
her
hand
and
took
a
peach
a
pear
a
bunch
of
blue
grapes
the
pipes
played
merrily
together
and
higher
and
higher
and
higher
soared
the
lark
and
sang
then
psyche
heard
the
brook
babbling
gently
the
doves
answered
one
another
and
round
her
the
morning
sang
her
welcome
then
footsteps
light
approached
her
softly
the
pipes
ceased
playing
the
girls
rose
and
made
a
deep
reverence
and
between
the
pillars
of
crystal
appeared
prince
eros
the
king
of
the
present
the
girls
withdrew
and
eros
approached
and
knelt
before
psyche
he
said
nothing
but
looked
at
her
eros
said
psyche
i
thank
you
i
have
rested
my
eyes
cease
to
burn
my
hunger
is
appeased
i
have
heard
sweet
music
and
everything
appeared
kind
and
to
love
me
everything
in
my
kingdom
is
glad
that
the
queen
has
come
everything
is
glad
that
the
queen
has
awaked
the
queen
of
the
present
murmured
psyche
then
she
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
leant
her
head
against
his
shoulder
eros
said
she
gently
i
love
you
how
shall
i
express
my
love
to
you
you
have
walked
in
the
track
of
my
tears
my
salt
tears
you
have
drunk
out
of
the
desert
from
the
breast
of
the
awful
sphinx
you
lifted
me
in
your
chariot
drawn
by
swift
griffons
in
my
swoon
i
felt
myself
going
through
the
air
not
with
the
speed
of
the
fair
chimera
whose
hoofs
struck
lightning
and
made
the
thunder
roll
high
in
the
ether
but
smoothly
and
evenly
on
wheels
over
the
clouds
delicately
tinted
with
the
glowing
dawn
how
long
did
we
travel
how
long
have
i
slept
eros
how
shall
i
express
my
love
to
you
my
love
is
deep
gratitude
inexpressible
because
you
rescued
me
my
love
is
thankfulness
because
you
have
cared
for
and
refreshed
me
my
love
is
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
rose
from
the
bed
what
psyche
said
he
gently
and
stood
up
my
love
is
deep
submissive
respect
o
eros
because
you
wanted
to
weep
my
tears
and
give
me
the
wish
of
my
heart
which
had
it
been
fulfilled
would
have
caused
you
the
most
poignant
grief
she
sank
upon
her
knees
and
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
kissed
it
long
he
lifted
her
up
and
pressed
her
to
his
breast
my
gentle
psyche
said
he
my
child
and
my
wife
and
my
tender
princess
kneel
not
to
me
in
love
it
is
sweet
to
give
and
to
suffer
love
gives
and
love
suffers
i
have
only
suffered
but
not
given
said
psyche
in
a
low
tone
to
suffer
is
to
give
most
to
give
to
one
we
love
the
suffering
of
his
suffering
soul
is
the
greatest
gift
that
can
be
given
my
child
and
my
princess
try
with
the
remembrance
sacred
to
suffering
and
love
endured
and
loved
to
be
happy
in
the
present
oh
let
the
past
be
a
remembrance
a
sacred
remembrance
a
golden
remembrance
but
now
look
to
the
present
oh
let
the
present
comfort
you
the
present
little
humble
and
poor
look
this
is
all
this
cupola
is
my
palace
this
garden
is
my
kingdom
these
flowers
and
these
birds
they
are
all
my
treasures
roses
and
doves
and
the
singing
lark
more
i
have
not
but
i
have
still
my
love
my
love
great
as
the
heaven
and
wide
as
the
universe
but
he
who
lives
in
love
so
great
needs
no
greater
palace
and
no
greater
kingdom
to
rule
over
for
the
treasures
of
emeralda
i
would
not
exchange
my
kingdom
and
my
love
psyche
my
queen
yet
i
have
ornaments
for
you
the
princess
of
nakedness
with
the
wings
may
never
wear
jewels
of
precious
stones
and
jewels
i
have
not
but
pearls
psyche
i
have
pearls
which
emeralda
despises
pearls
psyche
i
found
in
your
tears
of
yesterday
see
i
strung
them
together
they
were
a
crown
for
you
pearls
may
adorn
you
tears
may
adorn
you
my
child
of
suffering
my
wife
of
love
queen
of
my
soul
and
of
my
kingdom
then
he
took
a
little
crown
of
twelve
great
pearls
and
put
it
on
her
head
then
he
hung
a
necklace
of
pearls
round
her
neck
and
as
she
stood
before
him
naked
so
immaculately
delicate
in
her
princessly
nakedness
he
threw
around
her
loins
a
light
thin
veil
richly
adorned
with
pearls
and
which
she
fastened
in
a
knot
then
he
gave
her
a
mirror
and
she
beheld
herself
very
beautiful
crowned
like
a
queen
and
smiled
with
contentment
am
i
a
queen
she
said
softly
am
i
happy
eros
do
you
love
me
is
this
the
happiness
of
the
present
eros
do
i
love
you
out
of
gratitude
and
respect
my
husband
and
my
king
he
led
her
gently
away
through
the
porticos
down
the
crystal
steps
cupids
hovered
about
them
the
lark
sang
high
in
the
heavens
the
roses
perfumed
the
air
the
brook
murmured
gently
the
spring
rejoiced
to
welcome
them
and
behind
the
shrubs
the
pipes
played
a
duet
the
of
the
horizon
was
peaceful
and
above
the
heaven
arched
like
a
turquoise
chalice
everything
sang
everything
was
fragrant
in
the
grass
buzzed
thousands
of
insects
about
the
flowers
fluttered
butterflies
and
where
psyche
on
her
husband
arm
walked
along
the
all
the
flowers
bowed
to
her
in
homage
the
white
slender
lilies
the
violets
with
laughing
eyes
tall
flowers
and
short
flowers
on
long
and
short
stems
and
all
gave
forth
their
fragrance
eros
pointed
around
this
is
the
present
psyche
said
he
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
this
is
happiness
that
is
as
a
lily
and
a
violet
she
whispered
with
her
lips
to
his
chapter
xiii
the
pleasant
days
followed
each
other
like
a
row
of
laughing
houris
eros
and
psyche
tended
the
flowers
which
did
not
fade
when
psyche
stroked
the
stems
or
gently
kissed
the
calyces
they
wandered
along
the
brook
and
if
the
days
were
warm
sought
coolness
under
the
awning
in
the
crystal
palace
where
the
doves
cooed
round
the
basin
the
flutes
played
or
eros
himself
took
a
lyre
and
sang
at
psyche
feet
the
stories
of
days
gone
by
it
was
one
of
the
pleasures
of
the
present
between
the
shrubs
where
may
strewed
fragrant
naked
chubby
cupids
with
tender
wings
played
or
romped
hovering
like
little
clouds
in
the
air
the
sweet
nights
followed
the
pleasant
days
the
diamond
stars
the
same
which
psyche
had
entreated
to
watch
over
her
in
the
desert
glittered
in
the
heavens
under
the
roses
close
to
one
another
slumbered
the
children
tired
out
with
play
their
little
mouths
open
and
their
chubby
legs
all
folds
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
breath
of
lilac
and
jasmine
it
was
spring
it
was
the
present
it
was
night
and
while
psyche
lay
with
her
head
against
eros
shoulder
and
he
wound
his
arm
round
her
waist
while
psyche
looked
up
at
the
stars
sacred
in
the
violet
night
the
nightingale
broke
out
into
melody
the
bird
sang
and
sang
alone
everything
was
still
the
bird
sang
and
let
her
notes
fall
in
the
air
like
drops
of
sprinkled
sound
like
the
harmonious
falling
of
water
from
a
playing
fountain
the
bird
sang
and
psyche
closed
her
eyes
and
felt
on
her
lips
eros
kiss
the
days
followed
the
nights
it
was
always
the
sweet
pleasure
of
flowers
and
birds
of
spring
and
love
cupids
and
roses
music
and
dance
the
flowers
were
more
beautiful
and
did
not
fade
the
fruits
were
sweeter
and
of
richer
colour
the
spring
air
was
lighter
and
life
was
happier
than
a
golden
day
it
was
day
which
lasted
days
and
nights
it
was
the
present
if
psyche
were
alone
she
longed
for
eros
and
when
she
saw
him
again
she
spread
out
her
arms
and
they
loved
each
other
if
psyche
were
alone
she
wandered
about
in
the
rosy
spring
morning
the
flowers
bowed
down
to
her
the
brook
flowed
cool
over
her
feet
she
played
with
the
winged
cherubs
who
flew
about
her
head
like
butterflies
she
sat
down
in
the
moss
full
of
violets
she
bade
the
children
take
off
her
crown
loosen
the
plaits
of
her
long
hair
untie
the
knots
of
the
drapery
round
her
loins
and
she
lay
down
on
the
bank
of
the
brook
her
hand
played
with
the
clear
cold
water
and
naked
in
the
shade
of
flowery
shrubs
she
fell
asleep
and
the
cupids
round
her
then
the
step
of
the
king
awoke
her
the
children
awoke
they
dressed
her
and
she
went
to
meet
her
husband
and
received
him
with
open
arms
it
was
the
sweet
delight
of
the
present
one
day
she
was
sleeping
naked
under
the
shrubs
the
boys
round
about
her
on
the
moss
lay
her
crown
and
her
veil
and
the
brooklet
flowed
on
gently
murmuring
the
day
was
very
still
heavy
with
warmth
a
storm
was
brewing
but
the
sky
was
still
blue
in
the
distance
where
the
horizon
was
like
waves
of
the
sea
clouds
pregnant
with
storm
curled
up
gloomily
like
ostrich
feathers
and
once
there
was
lightning
but
no
thunder
then
above
the
ridge
of
the
hill
something
dark
appeared
to
rise
against
the
stormy
clouds
it
was
round
like
a
head
like
a
black
head
from
the
black
head
leered
two
eyes
black
as
jet
and
nothing
more
appeared
long
leered
the
eyes
then
from
the
palace
a
voice
cried
psyche
psyche
psyche
awoke
and
the
cupids
with
her
eros
approached
and
led
her
away
the
air
grew
dark
and
the
next
moment
the
summer
storm
burst
forth
dark
sky
lightning
rain
and
thunder
rapidly
rolling
on
it
lasted
only
for
a
time
then
the
sky
became
blue
again
the
flowers
recovered
their
breath
and
raised
their
drooping
heads
shaking
with
fresh
rain
chapter
xiv
next
day
when
psyche
was
sleeping
again
by
the
brook
the
dark
head
with
the
leering
eyes
of
jet
appeared
again
on
the
horizon
for
a
long
time
the
eyes
leered
full
of
lust
then
the
head
rose
up
higher
like
a
dark
sun
behind
the
in
the
sky
it
was
a
face
tanned
by
the
sun
with
hair
round
the
temples
a
wreath
of
vine
leaves
and
from
the
wreath
protruded
two
horns
like
those
of
a
young
goat
the
eyes
looked
lustful
and
young
as
though
they
were
jet
and
gold
the
lips
laughed
in
the
curly
beard
and
the
sharp
teeth
were
dazzling
white
the
pointed
ears
stood
up
then
the
dark
face
became
perfectly
visible
in
the
light
the
shoulders
rose
brown
and
naked
and
two
brown
hands
with
long
fingers
lifted
to
the
lips
a
pipe
of
short
and
long
reeds
the
pipe
played
a
fanfare
a
march
of
very
quick
notes
then
it
stopped
and
the
eyes
leered
psyche
moved
in
her
sleep
then
the
pipe
sounded
again
and
psyche
opened
her
eyes
astonished
she
listened
to
the
notes
of
the
pipe
as
they
rose
and
fell
so
as
she
had
never
heard
before
lively
and
wanton
quick
and
playful
she
sat
up
leant
on
her
arm
and
looked
she
started
there
on
the
horizon
like
a
dark
sun
she
saw
the
brown
face
and
the
lips
in
the
curly
beard
blowing
the
reeds
short
and
long
psyche
started
and
looked
on
trembling
then
the
pipe
stopped
again
and
roguishly
the
head
nodded
to
her
psyche
was
frightened
she
woke
the
boys
she
fled
away
from
the
palace
eros
came
to
meet
her
at
first
she
meant
to
speak
but
he
kissed
her
and
why
she
did
not
know
but
she
spoke
not
then
she
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
eros
that
night
but
in
her
husband
arms
she
lacked
the
courage
to
speak
she
did
not
tell
him
the
next
morning
she
resolved
not
to
repose
again
in
the
moss
by
the
brook
but
that
afternoon
she
played
with
the
cupids
and
tired
fell
asleep
in
the
same
place
the
pipe
awoke
her
on
the
horizon
the
brown
face
stood
out
against
the
sun
and
roguishly
nodded
to
her
psyche
indignant
looked
up
the
head
rose
the
shoulders
rose
and
the
whole
form
then
rose
up
a
sunburnt
youth
with
the
legs
of
a
goat
and
cloven
hoofs
there
he
stood
his
dark
shadow
reflected
in
the
golden
rays
of
the
setting
sun
he
blew
his
reeds
he
piped
lustily
and
merrily
roguishly
and
joyously
and
as
well
as
he
could
to
please
psyche
she
listened
about
her
the
boys
were
sleeping
and
she
smiled
he
saw
her
smile
and
smiled
too
then
proudly
she
pointed
with
her
finger
for
him
to
go
he
went
but
the
next
day
he
was
there
again
then
she
saw
him
every
day
he
stood
in
the
sun
which
was
going
down
and
blew
his
reeds
laughed
and
nodded
to
her
roguishly
sometimes
psyche
bade
him
be
gone
sometimes
she
pretended
not
to
see
who
was
playing
there
sometimes
she
listened
graciously
when
she
heard
the
king
call
psyche
psyche
she
woke
the
cupids
who
dressed
her
in
a
moment
and
went
to
meet
her
husband
she
kissed
him
and
wished
to
tell
him
that
every
day
a
young
man
with
goats
legs
stood
on
the
hill
and
played
upon
his
pipe
but
because
she
had
kept
silence
so
long
she
was
silent
again
and
could
not
open
her
lips
it
made
her
sad
and
eros
saw
her
sadness
and
often
asked
her
what
it
was
that
disturbed
the
equanimity
of
her
soul
she
said
nothing
and
embraced
him
and
declared
that
she
was
happy
but
when
the
lark
warbled
and
the
nightingale
sweet
notes
were
heard
when
eros
sang
to
the
lyre
and
the
brook
murmured
gently
psyche
always
heard
between
the
pleasant
sounds
the
impudent
tunes
of
the
reeds
short
and
long
she
tried
not
to
hear
but
she
always
heard
them
they
sounded
saucily
and
merrily
like
the
sounds
of
a
little
bird
in
a
wood
calling
something
to
her
from
afar
she
heard
but
did
not
yet
understand
what
one
day
when
he
stood
in
the
same
place
blowing
lustily
with
cheeks
psyche
indignant
rose
with
her
lips
closely
pressed
together
she
put
her
veil
on
and
wound
it
tightly
round
her
loins
without
waking
the
boys
then
with
a
firm
step
and
innocently
she
crossed
a
little
slope
and
came
into
a
valley
a
valley
of
grass
there
the
brook
flowed
away
between
multitudes
of
irises
and
narcissi
the
goat
leering
and
laughing
tripped
nimbly
down
the
hill
on
his
hoofs
to
meet
her
who
are
you
said
psyche
haughtily
i
am
the
satyr
said
he
deferentially
and
now
will
you
just
see
me
dance
he
piped
a
waltz
and
danced
for
her
to
the
measure
of
his
tripping
music
he
turned
out
his
feet
spun
round
and
round
and
underneath
on
his
back
she
saw
his
tiny
tail
wagging
she
laughed
and
found
him
amusing
with
his
tail
and
feet
and
horns
then
he
turned
a
somersault
and
finished
his
dance
with
a
bow
you
may
not
come
here
said
psyche
severely
this
is
the
kingdom
of
the
present
and
i
am
the
queen
and
my
husband
is
eros
the
king
of
this
kingdom
you
dance
indeed
nicely
and
you
play
rather
pretty
tunes
but
you
may
not
come
here
we
have
here
the
lark
and
the
nightingale
and
my
husband
sings
to
the
lyre
that
is
classical
music
said
the
satyr
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
classical
music
but
you
may
not
come
here
and
pipe
and
disturb
me
in
my
afternoon
slumber
if
my
husband
knew
it
he
would
be
very
angry
and
have
you
torn
to
pieces
by
two
raging
griffons
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
said
the
satyr
why
i
tame
panthers
and
they
are
much
more
dangerous
i
had
pity
on
you
continued
psyche
severely
raising
her
head
in
queenly
dignity
and
have
not
yet
said
anything
to
the
king
but
if
you
come
again
i
will
tell
him
no
you
wo
said
the
satyr
saucily
you
are
an
boy
said
psyche
angry
and
offended
you
must
not
speak
so
to
a
princess
i
ought
not
to
condescend
to
speak
to
you
i
can
see
very
well
that
you
do
know
how
people
behave
at
court
and
that
you
come
from
the
wood
and
you
are
ugly
too
with
your
hairy
feet
and
your
tail
the
satyr
looked
at
her
astonished
i
think
you
very
pretty
he
whispered
admiringly
oh
i
think
you
so
pretty
you
have
such
pretty
eyes
and
such
golden
hair
and
such
a
white
skin
only
i
do
like
your
wings
the
nymphs
have
any
you
may
not
speak
to
me
like
that
said
psyche
vexed
i
am
the
queen
how
dare
you
go
away
now
else
i
will
call
the
wild
beasts
here
well
do
be
angry
said
the
satyr
in
a
low
imploring
tone
that
is
my
way
of
speaking
we
all
speak
like
that
in
the
wood
the
bacchantes
too
are
not
particular
what
they
say
we
are
unacquainted
with
your
court
language
and
we
do
know
anything
of
classical
music
but
we
are
always
very
merry
and
sociable
together
but
you
must
come
once
are
you
going
said
psyche
imperiously
and
red
with
passion
and
with
her
finger
she
pointed
to
him
to
be
gone
he
crouched
down
suddenly
in
the
reeds
of
the
brook
among
the
irises
and
narcissi
and
she
saw
him
stealing
away
through
the
high
grass
when
she
turned
round
she
beheld
the
cupids
they
were
bringing
her
her
crown
the
king
is
looking
for
you
psyche
they
cried
out
in
the
distance
and
like
a
cloud
they
hovered
round
her
she
went
back
with
them
and
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
husband
do
roam
so
far
away
my
little
psyche
said
eros
in
the
wood
behind
the
hills
are
wild
beasts
night
came
on
eros
sang
the
nightingale
filled
the
air
with
her
sweet
notes
classical
music
thought
psyche
chapter
xv
psyche
had
a
secret
why
did
she
not
tell
it
she
did
not
know
she
could
not
after
having
once
kept
silent
she
knew
that
she
was
not
doing
right
by
being
silent
and
yet
she
did
not
speak
but
she
was
very
sad
about
it
and
felt
dissatisfied
then
she
wanted
to
speak
with
eros
but
because
she
had
said
nothing
at
first
she
was
afraid
and
then
she
said
to
herself
the
satyr
does
nothing
wrong
by
standing
there
and
piping
a
little
and
it
is
not
worth
while
thinking
much
about
it
and
yet
she
did
think
about
it
and
in
her
ears
she
always
heard
his
saucy
voice
his
coarse
words
countrified
and
funny
then
she
laughed
about
it
all
but
what
does
he
do
what
is
he
a
satyr
what
is
a
satyr
what
are
bacchantes
and
what
are
nymphs
panthers
too
i
have
never
seen
i
should
like
to
see
them
what
is
their
life
there
in
the
wood
there
are
many
lives
in
the
world
and
most
of
them
are
a
secret
i
only
know
the
courtiers
of
the
kingdom
of
the
past
here
there
are
the
two
girls
that
play
on
the
pipe
and
the
winged
children
i
should
like
to
see
all
that
there
is
in
the
world
and
experience
all
that
is
in
life
there
must
be
strange
things
which
i
never
see
the
chimera
was
glorious
and
deep
in
my
soul
i
always
long
for
him
but
in
other
respects
everything
is
the
same
no
wonders
take
place
in
this
garden
eros
is
a
young
prince
then
there
are
the
doves
the
griffons
the
cupids
that
is
all
so
commonplace
oh
to
seek
to
wander
the
world
is
so
great
the
universe
is
awful
although
it
has
limits
my
father
said
it
had
no
limits
oh
if
it
had
no
limits
oh
to
seek
to
wander
to
soar
in
the
air
i
shall
never
see
the
chimera
again
never
shall
i
soar
in
the
air
again
he
conjured
up
visions
for
me
and
then
let
them
pass
away
oh
to
soar
through
the
air
when
shall
i
see
him
again
and
when
shall
i
soar
again
eros
i
love
he
is
my
husband
but
he
has
no
wings
the
chimera
had
powerful
wings
of
silver
feathers
he
has
left
me
for
ever
so
alone
with
her
thought
she
wandered
in
the
garden
the
cupids
she
drove
away
and
crying
they
hid
themselves
among
the
roses
when
the
satyr
appeared
she
went
to
meet
him
in
the
valley
where
the
irises
were
blooming
so
you
are
there
again
yes
wo
you
just
see
me
dance
again
he
danced
and
frisked
his
tail
i
have
already
told
you
more
than
once
that
you
may
not
come
here
said
psyche
severely
he
winked
roguishly
he
knew
very
well
that
his
presence
was
not
disagreeable
to
her
you
are
so
beautiful
he
said
in
his
most
flattering
tone
much
more
beautiful
than
any
of
the
nymphs
and
the
bacchantes
then
said
psyche
much
more
beautiful
than
the
bacchantes
he
answered
but
they
are
also
very
nice
tell
me
would
you
like
to
see
them
psyche
was
very
inquisitive
and
he
noticed
it
wo
you
just
see
them
he
repeated
temptingly
where
said
psyche
look
there
he
pointed
in
the
distance
with
his
finger
on
the
hill
psyche
saw
forms
madly
whirling
round
in
a
dance
those
are
the
bacchantes
said
the
satyr
psyche
laughed
how
madly
they
whirl
round
she
exclaimed
are
they
always
so
merry
oh
we
are
always
dancing
said
the
satyr
in
the
wood
it
is
always
pleasure
we
play
at
tag
with
one
another
we
drink
the
juice
of
the
grapes
and
we
dance
till
nightfall
psyche
psyche
called
a
voice
it
was
her
husband
the
satyr
fled
through
the
flags
and
psyche
hastened
back
she
threw
herself
into
eros
arms
who
asked
her
where
she
had
been
and
without
answering
him
she
began
to
cry
and
hid
her
face
in
his
breast
what
is
it
little
psyche
asked
eros
are
you
in
trouble
amongst
the
roses
the
boys
cry
and
by
the
brook
the
queen
cries
is
there
then
sadness
in
my
kingdom
does
not
psyche
feel
happy
she
wept
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
to
say
that
she
did
not
know
and
she
hid
her
face
in
his
breast
tell
me
psyche
what
is
the
matter
she
would
have
liked
to
tell
him
but
she
could
not
a
stronger
power
kept
her
back
does
not
psyche
feel
happy
does
she
long
for
the
chimera
she
laid
her
little
hand
upon
his
lips
do
speak
about
him
i
am
not
worthy
of
him
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
eros
he
kissed
her
very
gently
what
does
my
psyche
think
about
may
i
not
leave
her
any
more
alone
by
the
brook
no
no
said
she
hastily
and
drew
his
arms
round
her
no
she
continued
quickly
do
leave
me
alone
any
more
always
stay
by
me
protect
me
from
myself
o
eros
is
little
psyche
ill
she
nodded
in
the
affirmative
and
laid
her
burning
head
upon
his
breast
she
nestled
against
him
and
shut
her
feverish
eyes
he
stayed
by
her
and
all
around
was
still
and
the
cupids
appeared
fluttering
in
the
air
that
night
she
slept
in
eros
arms
she
awoke
for
a
moment
out
of
her
sleep
far
away
in
the
distance
through
the
crystal
of
the
palace
she
heard
the
sound
of
pipes
she
raised
her
head
and
listened
but
she
would
not
hear
any
more
and
hid
herself
in
eros
arms
and
fell
asleep
on
his
heart
the
next
day
he
stayed
by
her
and
they
wandered
to
the
brook
sadness
hung
over
the
garden
the
flowers
drooped
in
the
afternoon
psyche
became
uneasy
she
heard
the
pipe
and
in
the
distance
caught
a
glimpse
of
vague
forms
dancing
do
you
see
nothing
she
asked
eros
no
do
you
hear
nothing
she
said
again
no
he
answered
poor
psyche
is
and
the
flowers
are
ill
too
because
she
is
oh
let
eros
cure
you
the
following
night
in
the
arms
of
her
husband
she
heard
the
pipe
it
played
saucy
short
lively
tunes
come
come
now
dance
with
us
we
are
drinking
the
grapes
come
come
she
could
resist
no
longer
trembling
she
loosed
herself
from
her
husband
arms
who
was
asleep
she
got
up
stole
out
of
the
palace
fled
through
the
garden
to
the
alluring
voice
the
flowers
in
the
brook
seemed
to
entreat
her
oh
go
not
away
oh
go
not
away
the
nightingale
uttered
a
cry
and
she
thought
it
was
an
owl
she
hurried
on
to
the
valley
where
the
irises
were
in
blossom
there
near
the
brook
in
the
light
of
the
moon
stood
the
satyr
tripping
to
the
sound
of
his
pipe
and
round
him
hand
in
hand
madly
danced
the
bacchantes
naked
a
panther
skin
cast
about
them
their
wild
streaming
hair
encircled
with
they
danced
like
drunken
spectres
in
the
pale
moonlight
night
they
waved
their
thyrsus
and
pelted
each
other
with
grapes
which
smashed
to
juice
upon
their
faces
come
come
they
cried
triumphantly
psyche
was
startled
by
their
voices
rough
and
hoarse
but
they
opened
their
circle
two
stretched
their
hand
out
to
psyche
and
they
danced
round
with
her
the
wild
dance
excited
her
she
had
never
known
till
then
what
dancing
was
and
she
danced
with
sparkling
eyes
she
waved
a
thyrsus
and
pressed
the
grapes
to
her
mouth
then
suddenly
the
satyr
caught
hold
of
her
and
kissed
her
passionately
pressing
the
grapes
to
her
lips
psyche
psyche
she
started
and
stood
still
the
bacchantes
the
satyr
fled
psyche
hastened
back
with
her
hand
she
wiped
her
contaminated
burning
lips
psyche
she
ran
to
meet
eros
but
when
she
saw
him
godlike
and
beautiful
as
an
image
spotlessly
pure
in
the
moonlight
with
his
noble
countenance
his
deep
brown
eyes
full
of
love
she
was
so
disgusted
with
herself
that
she
fell
at
his
feet
in
a
swoon
he
lifted
her
up
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
he
watched
while
she
slumbered
the
whole
night
he
watched
by
her
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
wandering
in
her
mind
her
face
glowed
with
fever
and
ever
and
anon
she
wiped
her
lips
outside
in
the
garden
the
flowers
drooped
in
sorrow
the
lark
was
silent
and
the
little
angels
sat
together
with
their
wings
drawn
in
the
sky
was
and
gloomy
that
night
psyche
slept
in
eros
arms
and
afar
off
the
pipe
allured
her
she
extracted
herself
from
eros
embrace
and
got
up
she
wanted
to
kiss
him
for
the
last
time
but
durst
not
for
fear
of
waking
him
farewell
she
whispered
very
gently
noble
eros
beloved
husband
farewell
i
am
unworthy
of
you
the
satyr
kiss
is
still
burning
on
my
lips
my
mouth
is
on
fire
from
the
juice
of
the
grapes
farewell
and
if
you
can
forgive
me
she
went
the
night
was
sultry
and
heavy
with
thunder
the
flowers
exhausted
hung
their
heads
the
nightingale
uttered
a
cry
and
she
thought
it
was
an
owl
bats
flitted
about
with
flapping
wings
she
walked
with
a
firm
step
she
followed
the
brook
to
where
it
flowed
into
the
valley
yonder
with
the
satyr
in
their
midst
danced
the
bacchantes
hurrah
hurrah
they
cried
out
rough
and
hoarse
and
threw
at
her
a
bunch
of
grapes
she
hesitated
a
moment
she
raised
her
eyes
through
the
gloomy
night
a
single
star
glistened
like
a
cold
proud
eye
sacred
star
said
psyche
you
who
watched
over
me
before
and
now
leave
me
for
ever
tell
him
that
i
am
unworthy
of
him
and
beg
him
to
forgive
me
the
star
hid
itself
in
the
darkness
come
cried
the
bacchantes
psyche
took
a
step
forward
brook
she
then
cried
little
stream
of
the
land
of
the
present
babbling
pure
and
peacefully
in
which
i
never
more
may
cool
myself
oh
tell
him
that
i
am
unworthy
of
him
and
beg
him
to
forgive
me
the
brook
went
murmuring
over
the
stones
and
muttered
no
no
come
come
cried
the
bacchantes
then
psyche
plucked
a
single
violet
white
as
a
maiden
face
sweet
violet
said
she
humble
flower
do
be
proud
your
queen
who
is
forsaking
her
kingdom
entreats
the
star
and
brook
in
vain
she
is
no
longer
a
queen
she
is
no
longer
obeyed
sweet
violet
hear
the
prayer
of
psyche
who
unworthy
is
forsaking
the
present
stay
psyche
implored
the
flower
in
her
hand
dear
little
flower
said
psyche
born
in
the
moss
withering
when
you
are
plucked
what
do
you
know
of
gods
and
mortals
what
do
you
know
of
soul
and
life
and
power
psyche
can
no
longer
stay
but
beg
love
to
forgive
her
oh
give
him
my
last
message
she
kissed
the
flower
and
laid
it
in
the
moss
psyche
psyche
come
cried
the
bacchantes
she
sprang
forward
into
the
midst
of
the
dance
here
i
am
she
cried
wildly
and
they
dragged
her
away
with
them
to
the
wood
chapter
xvi
when
eros
awoke
that
morning
he
found
not
psyche
by
his
side
he
got
up
thinking
that
she
was
in
the
garden
and
went
out
the
sky
was
dull
and
lowering
a
mist
hung
over
the
hills
the
lark
had
not
sung
the
cupids
were
not
fluttering
about
psyche
cried
he
psyche
no
answer
was
returned
no
sigh
rustled
in
the
leaves
of
the
trees
no
insect
hummed
in
the
grass
the
flowers
hung
down
withered
on
their
limp
stems
a
deathly
chilliness
reigned
around
a
fearful
presentiment
took
possession
of
eros
he
walked
along
the
along
the
brook
oh
where
is
psyche
he
cried
oh
tell
me
water
flowers
birds
where
is
psyche
no
answer
was
returned
the
brook
flowed
on
murkily
and
noiselessly
the
flowers
lay
across
the
path
no
bird
sang
among
the
leaves
he
wrung
his
hands
and
hastened
on
then
he
came
to
the
spot
where
psyche
was
wont
to
rest
in
the
moss
by
the
brook
in
the
shade
of
the
shrubs
who
will
tell
me
where
psyche
is
he
exclaimed
in
despair
and
threw
himself
on
the
moss
and
sobbed
eros
cried
a
weak
voice
who
speaks
there
i
a
white
violet
which
psyche
plucked
hear
me
quickly
for
i
feel
i
am
dying
and
my
elfin
voice
is
scarcely
audible
to
your
ear
listen
to
me
i
am
lying
close
to
you
take
me
in
your
hand
eros
took
the
flower
psyche
has
been
enticed
by
the
satyr
into
the
wood
the
bacchantes
have
taken
her
away
this
was
her
last
word
that
she
was
unworthy
of
you
and
went
away
praying
for
forgiveness
she
could
not
remain
she
said
she
went
eros
forgive
her
the
flower
shrivelled
up
in
his
hand
eros
rose
and
tottered
he
too
felt
that
he
was
dying
sad
at
heart
walked
eros
and
all
along
his
path
the
flowers
now
lay
shrivelled
the
brook
was
dry
the
lark
lay
dead
before
his
feet
the
cupids
lay
dead
in
the
withered
roses
eros
went
into
the
castle
and
fell
upon
the
purple
bed
a
single
dove
was
expiring
at
the
marble
basin
the
strings
of
the
lyre
were
all
broken
eros
too
felt
that
his
life
was
leaving
his
body
he
raised
his
eyes
over
which
the
film
of
death
was
stealing
and
looked
about
the
castle
the
crystal
crumbled
off
and
split
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
sacred
powers
prayed
he
forgive
her
as
i
forgive
her
and
love
her
till
the
end
as
i
shall
and
for
ever
let
her
find
what
she
seeks
let
her
wanderings
once
come
to
an
end
let
her
soar
through
the
air
if
she
must
till
she
comes
to
the
purest
sphere
this
sphere
was
the
earth
the
sweet
present
the
little
on
which
she
could
not
wander
and
thus
felt
within
her
the
irresistible
desire
sacred
powers
let
her
one
day
find
what
her
happiness
is
then
if
it
is
not
i
let
her
find
his
voice
failed
his
eyes
opened
as
in
a
vision
and
he
whispered
and
finished
his
prayer
find
in
the
future
that
sacred
word
was
his
last
he
died
in
the
kingdom
of
the
present
that
once
had
been
as
a
smiling
garden
everything
was
now
dead
then
in
the
mist
which
hung
over
the
ridge
of
the
mountains
something
seemed
to
be
creeping
near
something
with
feet
that
could
only
move
slowly
from
many
sides
over
the
the
strange
creeping
came
nearer
gigantic
hairy
feet
of
monstrous
spiders
were
walking
over
it
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
they
were
spiders
with
big
swollen
bodies
and
feet
always
in
motion
they
were
the
sacred
spiders
of
emeralda
princess
of
the
past
eagerly
they
ran
to
the
dead
garden
of
the
present
they
surrounded
the
garden
and
threw
out
their
filaments
to
the
crystal
roof
of
the
palace
then
they
wove
over
the
present
that
lay
dead
one
single
gigantic
web
and
whilst
they
wove
the
dead
present
went
to
dust

in

in

sun
autumn
was
keeping
festival
the
foliage
shone
resplendent
in
yellow
bronze
purple
and
pink
the
moss
looked
like
antique
velvet
with
gusts
of
wind
the
branches
madly
arrogant
shook
off
their
exuberance
of
sere
and
yellow
leaves
as
if
they
were
strewing
the
paths
with
silver
and
gold
and
rustling
notes
loudly
laughing
danced
the
dryads
through
the
whirling
leaves
out
of
the
foaming
stream
between
rocks
rose
the
white
naked
nymphs
where
is
she
where
is
she
cried
they
inquisitively
there
she
comes
there
she
comes
shouted
the
mad
dryads
and
in
handfuls
they
cast
the
leaves
into
the
air
which
whirled
over
the
nymphs
and
fell
down
on
the
water
the
dryads
danced
past
and
the
nymphs
looked
out
inquisitively
they
stood
a
naked
group
in
their
rocky
bath
their
arms
were
clasped
round
one
another
green
was
their
hair
and
white
as
pearls
were
their
bosoms
the
sere
and
yellow
leaves
kept
whirling
about
trampling
feet
were
approaching
and
were
heard
amongst
the
rustling
leaves
were
drawing
near
the
golden
foliage
quivered
like
a
curtain
of
thin
fine
gold
lace
there
she
comes
there
she
comes
exclaimed
the
nymphs
with
joy
the
branches
cracked
the
leaves
whirled
about
the
tender
sprays
recoiled
from
the
noisy
who
were
advancing
nearer
they
came
with
the
sound
of
pipe
and
cymbal
drunken
bacchantes
danced
before
them
waving
the
thyrsus
hand
in
hand
with
fauns
and
satyrs
they
encircled
a
triumphal
car
drawn
by
spotted
lynxes
high
on
the
car
sat
a
youth
beardless
with
a
wreath
of
round
his
forehead
full
of
laughter
and
animal
spirits
with
blue
eyes
that
showed
his
love
of
pleasure
naked
were
his
godlike
limbs
chubbily
formed
like
the
tender
flesh
of
a
boy
and
his
legs
were
long
and
slender
his
arms
rounded
like
those
of
a
woman
he
was
the
prince
of
the
wood
of
divine
origin
prince
bacchus
was
his
name
and
next
to
him
on
the
triumphal
car
sat
little
psyche
enthroned
she
too
was
naked
with
nothing
on
but
her
veil
and
her
wings
were
so
strikingly
beautiful
crimson
and
soft
yellow
and
with
four
eyes
round
the
car
close
together
as
a
bunch
of
grapes
sported
madly
a
number
of
tumbling
over
one
another

in

the
procession
rushed
on
through

the

which
spiteful
as

spat
at

and
bore
great
heavy
bunches
of

high
up
like

swept
past
as
though
hurried
along
by
the
gale
a
little
had
fallen
and
lay
in
the
yellow
leaves
playing
with
his
chubby
legs
from
the
juice
of
grapes
he
was
crying
because
he
had
been
left
behind
then
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
to
his
feet
and
tottered
after
the
procession
the
nymphs
laughed
loudly
at
the
little
they
dived
under
and
beneath
the
rocks
the
wind
blew
the
yellow
leaves
whirled
about
and
the
wood
became
still
and
lonely

gave
a

mocking
laugh
and
rushed
into
the
wood
it
was
a
moonlight
night
in
the
pale
moonbeams
she
left
the
wild
feast
behind
the
jealous
bacchantes
danced
round
bacchus
and
embraced
him

hastened
on
her
temples
throbbed
her
heart
beat
and
her
bosom
heaved
when
she
was
far
enough
away
she
stopped
pressed
both
her
hands
to
her
bosom
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
more
slowly
she
went
on
to
the
stream
fresh
was
the
autumn
night
but
burning
were
her
naked
limbs
the
wood
was
still
save
that
in
the
branches
the
wind
moaned
like
a
silvery
ship
the
moon
sailed
forth
from
the
luminous
ethereal
sea
and
the
rushing
foamed
like
snow
on
the
rocks
with
a
longing
desire
for
coolness
and
water

stepped
down
to
the
flags
on
the
bank
with
her
hands
she
put
aside
the
irises
and
made
her
way
through
the
ferns
and
plunged
her
foot
into

the

dived
up

joyously

into

up
let
me
be
with
you
a

let
me
cool
myself
in
your

the

pressed
round

her
on

she
lay
down
at
full

cool
my

cool
my

o

sprinkled

on
her

put
her
arm
round
the
neck
of
one
of

your
hiss
on
my

as
on
burning

your
flakes
of
foam
evaporate
on

fire
in
my
breast
and
on
my
soul
o

and

but
although
my

is
dripping
and
my

and
my
limbs
too
my

are
scorched
my
poor

burns

is
consumed

gently
in

down
oh

imploringly
benevolent
nymphs
bathe
me
some
coolness
still
hangs
about
my
body
but
my
soul
oh
my
soul
you
can
never
cool
she
wept
and
the
nymphs
caught
up
her
tears
in
shells
are
you
collecting
my
tears
oh
no
they
are
not
worth
it
once
i
wept
a

once
they
were

crowned
me
with

drops
of
fire
and
though
they
should
congeal
and
become
rubies
or
topazes
they
may
never
crown
me
more
henceforth
my
tears
i
shall
always
shed
for

sleep
quietly
but
in
my
sleep
my
soul
keeps
burning
in
my
dreams
i
see
it
flame
up
high
up
as
out
of
a
hole
in
hell
oh
she
uttered
a
cry
as
of
pain
the
nymphs
rocked
her
in
their
entwined
arms
as
in
a
cradle
of
lilies
and
softly
sang
a
song

this
is
the
fire
that
nothing

chapter
xix
that
morning
she
wandered
about
in
the
rosy
autumn
dawn
a
mist
between
the
trees
stripped
of
leaves
along
the
path
she
trod
on
a
skin
she
found
a
satyr
and
a
bacchante
lying
in
a
drunken
sleep
tight
in
each
other
arms
a
cup
lay
on
the
ground
a
broken
thyrsus
grapes
she
hastened
on
and
sought
the
most
lonely
spots
the
foliage
became
scantier
the
trees
grew
farther
apart
the
wood
ended
in
a
plain
and
violet
misty
a
perspective
of
very
low
hills
psyche
walked
on
over
the
plain
and
climbed
the
hills
the
autumn
wind
blew
and
howled
between
shrubs
and
bushes
and
sang
the
approach
of
winter
but
psyche
felt
not
the
cold
for
her
naked
limbs
glowed
her
soul
was
all
on
fire
on
the
highest
she
looked
out
her
hand
above
her
eyes
gazing
into
the
violet
mist
unconscious
to
herself
she
hoped
for
something
vague
and
impossible
that
she
might
see
eros
that
he
would
come
to
her
that
she
would
fall
at
his
feet
that
he
would
forgive
her
tenderly
and
take
her
away
with
him
impossible
what
was
impossible
could
not
everything
be
possible
had
he
not
followed
the
track
of
her
tears
had
he
not
found
her
in
the
arms
of
the
sphinx
oh
she
hoped
she
hoped
she
hoped
more
definitely
her
soul
longed
for
the
balsam
of
his
love
in
the
palace
of
crystal
for
the
sounds
of
his
lyre
for
the
tender
words
in
the
garden
of
the
present
she
hoped
she
gazed
in
the
pale
glow
of
the
morning
sun
the
violet
mist
cleared
up
and
parted
like
violet
curtains
she
gazed
there
was
the
present
there
eros
would
be
mourning
for
his
naughty
psyche
there
he
would
presently
forgive
her
oh
how
she
hoped
how
she
longed
she
longed
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
dared
cry
in
a
plaintive
voice
eros
the
wind
blew
through
bush
and
shrub
and
sang
the
approach
of
winter
the
violet
curtains
of
mist
were
drawn
aside
the
sad
autumn
morning
appeared
there
now
visible
lay
the
present
and
psyche
gazed
screening
her
eyes
with
her
hand
there
she
saw
her
happiness
of
days
gone
by
destroyed
in
a
dead
withered
garden
a
ruin
crystal
pillars
crumbling
to
pieces
and
between
the
pillars
spiders
webs
all
over
the
garden
webs
web
upon
web
and
in
them
spiders
with
bloated
bodies
and
feet
then
she
saw
that
emeralda
was
reigning
then
she
felt
that
eros
was
dead
she
had
murdered
him
oh
how
her
limbs
glowed
how
her
soul
burned
oh
the
burning
pain
within
her
deep
within
a
pain
which
no
could
allay
which
no
mad
dance
could
deaden
and
the
nymphs
could
not
cool
though
they
poured
over
her
all
their
urns
oh
that
hell
in
her
soul
for
the
irretrievable
desolation
for
the
murdered
one
past
recall
oh
that
suffering
not
for
herself
but
for
him
for
another
that
repentance
that
burning
remorse
she
fell
to
the
ground
and
sobbed
the
pale
sunbeams
faded
away
thick
grey
clouds
came
sweeping
along
a
shower
of
hail
rattled
down
flinging
handfuls
of
stones
she
felt
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
she
looked
up
it
was
the
satyr
who
had
allured
her
with
his
pipe
there
on
that
very
spot
psyche
said
he
what
are
you
doing
here
so
far
away
from
all
of
us
winter
is
coming
psyche
listen
to
the
whistling
winds
feel
the
rattling
hail
the
last
leaves
are
being
blown
away
we
are
going
to
the
south
and
prince
bacchus
is
seeking
for
you
what
are
you
doing
here
and
why
are
you
crouching
down
and
weeping
we
are
having
a
feast
and
are
fleeing
the
winter
come
i
feel
no
cold
i
am
burning
let
me
stay
here
and
weep
and
die
why
should
you
die
o
psyche
psyche
so
pretty
and
so
gay
psyche
the
prettiest
and
gayest
who
can
dance
the
maddest
who
can
dance
out
all
the
bacchantes
come
she
laughed
through
her
tears
a
laugh
like
a
piercing
shriek
but
psyche
do
you
know
what
it
is
said
the
satyr
whispering
confidentially
do
you
know
what
it
is
that
prevents
you
from
being
happy
and
why
you
are
not
like
all
of
us
i
told
you
before
psyche
it
is
on
account
of
your
wings
your
wings
prevent
you
from
putting
a
beast
skin
round
you
and
entwining
your
hair
with
vine
the
nymphs
find
your
wings
pretty
but
what
do
you
want
with
things
that
are
pretty
yet
of
no
use
whatever
if
you
could
only
fly
with
those
wings
if
i
could
only
fly
with
those
wings
said
psyche
sighing
no
i
have
never
been
able
to
fly
with
them
my
poor
weak
wings
the
nymphs
think
your
wings
pretty
but
the
nymphs
are
sentimental
the
bacchantes
think
them
ugly
and
laugh
at
you
in
secret
prince
bacchus
does
not
like
wings
either
he
can
not
embrace
you
well
with
those
things
on
your
back
psyche
dear
psyche
listen
shall
i
tell
you
something
you
must
let
me
cut
those
wings
off
with
a
pair
of
for
when
you
have
got
rid
of
your
wings
then
you
can
throw
a
panther
skin
round
you
and
put
a
round
your
hair
and
you
will
be
altogether
one
of
us
the

rattled
down

no
use
at
all
if
i
can
not
possibly
get
cool
if
i
keep
burning
deep
within
me
it
is
better
perhaps
to
renounce
my
princess
rights
to
go
naked
no
longer
to
have
no
wings
tell
me
psyche
may
i
cut
them
off
yes
clip
them
cut
them
right
off
my
wings
which
are
only
pretty
she
cried
fiercely
cut
them
off
his
eyes
glowed
jet
and
gold
his
breath
came
quickly
from
joy
he
produced
his
sharp
scissors
and
whilst
she
knelt
he
cut
off
both
her
wings
they
fell
on
the
ground
and
shrivelled
up
oh
that
pains
that
pains
oh
that
pains
cried
psyche
it
is
a
little
wound
it
will
soon
heal
said
the
satyr
soothingly
but
grinning
with
pleasure
then
he
threw
a
panther
skin
round
her
put
a
wreath
of
on
her
head
and
she
was
like
a
fair
bacchante
still
very
young
and
tender
with
her
white
skin
with
her
tender
eyes
of
in
which
deep
down
dejection
reigned
psyche
cried
he
delighted
psyche
how
pretty
you
are
she
uttered
her
shrill
laugh
her
laugh
of
bitter
irony
he
led
her
away
down
the
hills
she
looked
about
yonder
lay
the
present
reduced
to
dust
and
she
looked
about
in
the
wind
which
was
blowing
her
wings
whirled
away
shrivelled
up
whirled
away
like
dry
leaves
she
laughed
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
they
hastened
back
to
the
wood
the
wind
blew
the
first
snowflakes
fell

into

winter

autumn
were
the
present
for
a
moment
and
sank
into
the
past
and
again
it
was
spring
in
the
grassy
plains
the
shepherds
drove
out
their
flocks
and
they
sang
because
the
sky
was
blue
because
the
world
trilled
with
hope
in
the
new
and
tempered
sunshine
what
did
the
shepherds
know
of
emeralda
they
had
never
seen
her
they
sang
they
sang
they
filled
the
air
with
their
song
as
a
reed
their
song
remained
quivering
and
hanging
in
the
air
in
the
wood
and
in
the
mountains
over
the
meadows
and
in
the
air
echo
sang
with
them
their
song
they
sang
because
the
sky
was
blue
emeralda
they
did
not
know
blue
blue
blue
was
the
air
hope
quivered
in
the
sunshine
and
love
in
their
hearts
into
the
grassy
plains
the
shepherds
drove
their
flocks
and
they
sang
because
the
sky
was
blue
on
the
border
of
the
wood
where
endless
plains
extended
there
lived
in
a
grotto
between
rocks
a
holy
hermit
who
was
a
hundred
years
old
how
many
seasons
had
he
seen
sink
into
the
pits
of
the
past
how
many
times
had
he
heard
the
lenten
song
of
the
shepherds
wrapped
in
contemplation
he
heard
them
singing
they
sang
because
the
sky
was
blue
the
lark
was
soaring
because
the
world
trilled
with
hope
they
sang
because
fleecy
lambs
were
sporting
again
in
the
meadows
they
sang
because
they
were
young
and
loved
the
shepherdesses
they
sang
of
blue
sky
of
hope
of
lambs
and
love
the
hermit
continued
deep
in
thought
every
spring
it
was
the
same
song
and
he
had
never
sung
with
them
never
had
he
known
the
present
the
spring
present
of
the
shepherds
the
hermit
continued
deep
in
thought
he
dreamed
that
satan
was
tempting
him
but
his
pious
mind
resisted
he
dreamed
that
he
had
died
in
prayer
and
his
soul
purified
ascended
into
heaven
far
off
in
the
grassy
plains
was
heard
the
bleating
of
the
lambs
the
voices
of
the
shepherds
the
hermit
heard
a
step
he
looked
up
he
saw
a
little
form
as
of
a
naked
girl
with
no
covering
but
her
hair
and
he
thought
it
was
really
satan
and
he
muttered
an
exorcism
he
knit
his
brow
he
crossed
his
arms
the
little
form
approached
and
knelt
down
holy
father
said
she
in
a
low
trembling
voice
do
drive
me
away
i
am
poor
and
unhappy
i
am
a
sinner
and
come
to
you
for
help
i
am
not
shameless
holy
father
and
i
am
ashamed
that
i
appear
before
you
naked
i
asked
the
shepherdesses
for
something
to
cover
me
but
they
laughed
at
me
drove
me
away
and
threw
stones
at
me
father
o
father
men
are
merciless
they
all
drive
me
away
i
come
from
the
wood
and
the
wild
beasts
are
not
so
cruel
as
men
in
the
wood
the
beasts
spared
me
a
lion
licked
the
wounds
on
my
feet
and
a
tigress
let
me
rest
in
the
lair
of
her
whelps
holy
father
the
wild
beasts
had
pity
then
why
do
you
remain
in
the
wood
devil
because
i
must
fulfill
a
duty
among
men
who
lays
the
task
upon
you
witch
devil
in
my
dream
soft
voices
have
spoken
to
me
the
voice
of
my
father
and
of
him
whom
i
loved
and
they
said
among
men
do
but
naked
i
can
not
go
among
men
for
they
throw
stones
at
me
and
therefore
o
father
i
come
to
you
and
entreat
you
give
me
something
to
cover
me
i
have
only
my
hair
to
hide
me
and
under
my
hair
i
am
naked
o
father
give
me
something
to
cover
me
o
father
give
me
your
oldest
mantle
for
my
penance
garb
the
hermit
looked
up
at
her
as
she
knelt
in
her
fair
hair
and
he
saw
that
she
was
weeping
her
tears
were
rubies
he
who
weeps
rubies
has
committed
great
sin
he
who
weeps
rubies
has
a
soul
crimson
with
sin
the
penitent
sobbed
and
bowed
her
head
to
the
ground
here
said
the
hermit
sternly
but
compassionately
here
is
a
mantle
here
is
a
cord
for
your
loins
and
here
is
a
mat
to
sleep
on
and
here
is
bread
here
is
the
eat
drink
cover
yourself
and
rest
thanks
holy
father
but
i
am
not
tired
i
am
not
hungry
and
thirsty
i
am
only
naked
and
i
thank
you
for
your
mantle
and
your
cord
she
put
on
the
mantle
as
a
and
whilst
red
with
shame
she
covered
herself
the
hermit
saw
on
her
two
are
you
wounded
i
was
long
ago
your
eyes
glow
have
you
a
fever
i
do
not
know
men
fever
but
my
soul
is
always
burning
like
a
cave
in
hell
who
are
you
one
heavy
burdened
with
sin
what
is
your
name
i
have
no
name
now
holy
father
oh
ask
no
more
and
let
me
go
whither
are
you
going
far
along
the
way
of
thistles
to
the
royal
castle
to
the
princess
emeralda
she
is
proud
she
is
the
princess
of
the
jewel
and
i
weep
jewels
i
shed
them
for
her
once
there
was
a
time
that
i
wept
pearls
o
father
let
me
go
go
then
and
do
penance
thanks
father
oh
give
me
your
blessing
the
hermit
blessed
her
she
went
then
as
a
pilgrim
in
her
the
path
was
steep
and
covered
with
thistles
in
the
distance
was
heard
the
song
of
the
shepherds
chapter
xxi
the
path
was
steep
and
covered
with
cactus
and
thistles
it
was
a
narrow
path
hewn
out
of
the
rocks
winding
up
the
basalt
mountain
where
high
on
the
top
stood
the
castle
the
castle
had
three
hundred
towers
which
rose
to
the
sky
along
them
swept
the
clouds
in
the
path
were
many
steps
hewn
out
of
stone
heavy
masses
of
cactus
grew
on
the
side
of
the
precipice
and
over
the
leaves
prickly
and
round
psyche
saw
the
grassy
valleys
of
the
kingdom
of
the
past
the
villages
the
towns
the
river
a
broad
silver
streak
and
there
behind
it
views
lakes
in
the
sky
and
quivering
lines
of
ether
higher
and
higher
she
went
up
the
steps
up
the
path
in
the
gloomy
chilly
shadow
whilst
the
sun
shone
over
the
meadows
she
climbed
up
and
below
she
saw
the
shepherds
with
their
sheep
and
their
song
quite
faint
came
up
to
her
in
the
coppice
she
broke
a
strong
stick
for
a
staff
a
lappet
of
her
mantle
she
had
drawn
over
her
head
as
a
hood
and
with
her
staff
and
her
hood
she
looked
like
a
pious
pilgrim
the
solitary
countryman
who
was
coming
down
the
rocky
path
did
not
throw
stones
at
her
but
greeted
her
reverently
she
kept
climbing
up
high
in
the
air
lay
the
castle
gloomy
and
inaccessible
a
town
of
towers
a
babel
of
pinnacles
along
it
swept
the
clouds
as
an
innocent
child
as
a
naked
princess
with
wings
psyche
had
lived
there
like
a
butterfly
on
a
rock
had
wandered
along
the
dreadful
parapets
had
longed
and
hoped
and
dreamed
oh
her
longings
of
innocence
her
hope
to
fly
through
the
air
to
the
opal
islands
her
dreams
pure
as
the
doves
that
flew
round
about
her
she
had
wandered
through
clouds
through
desert
and
wood
from
the
north
to
the
south
she
had
loved
the
chimera
had
put
questions
to
the
sphinx
she
had
been
queen
of
the
present
and
the
beloved
of
bacchus
and
now
now
she
came
back
wingless
with
a
soul
that
burned
her
continually
like
a
scarlet
child
of
hell
now
she
came
back
up
the
steep
path
her
she
had
borrowed
but
the
thistles
tore
her
foot
and
pale
from
pain
and
suffering
from
wounded
feet
and
shoulders
and
a
soul
that
burned
continually
was
her
face
that
peeped
out
from
under
her
wide
hood
up
up
she
went
supporting
herself
with
her
staff
oh
the
voice
of
her
father
of
eros
in
her
dream
when
the
was
over
then
repentance
had
begun
then
she
had
fled
through
the
wood
through
the
wild
beasts
and
the
lion
had
licked
her
foot
and
the
tigress
had
allowed
her
to
rest
in
the
warm
lair
of
her
whelps
then
she
went
on
climbing
higher
and
higher
would
she
never
get
to
the
top
would
the
castle
the
babel
of
pinnacles
the
town
of
towers
remain
ever
inaccessibly
high
in
the
clouds
her
step
left
blood
behind
on
the
rocky
stone
but
she
did
not
rest
rest
did
not
help
her
she
preferred
to
go
on
to
climb
if
she
walked
if
she
climbed
the
sooner
would
she
reach
the
castle
step
by
step
she
advanced
oh
she
was
no
longer
afraid
of
emeralda
what
could
emeralda
do
to
her
to
make
her
afraid
what
greater
suffering
could
her
sister
inflict
upon
her
than
the
pain
of
remorse
that
was
ever
with
her
wherever
she
went
and
on
she
climbed
and
the
thistles
tore
her
feet
and
the
solitary
man
who
was
coming
down
the
rocky
path
greeted
her
reverently
when
he
saw
the
blood
of
her
footstep
chapter
xxii
the
night
was
pitch
dark
when
she
stood
before
the
awful
gate
and
asked
admittance
and
the
guards
let
her
in
because
she
wore
a
holy
dress
the
halberdiers
took
her
to
the
hall
where
they
slept
or
kept
watch
and
invited
her
to
rest
she
sat
down
on
a
rude
bench
she
ate
their
brown
soldier
bread
she
drank
a
drop
of
their
wine
then
she
offered
them
a
ruby
for
their
hospitality
and
evening
meal
and
while
they
wondered
that
a
pilgrim
possessed
such
a
beautiful
jewel
she
said
in
her
strange
voice
weak
tired
and
yet
commanding
i
have
still
more
topazes
and
rubies
and
dark
purple
carbuncles
tell
the
princess
that
i
have
come
to
do
her
homage
and
give
her
my
jewels
the
message
was
sent
to
emeralda
and
the
queen
asked
the
pilgrim
to
come
she
sent
pages
to
conduct
her
to
the
throne
where
she
sat
and
psyche
understood
that
emeralda
was
afraid
of
treachery
afraid
of
the
approach
of
soul
and
therefore
was
so
surrounded
by
armed
men
she
passed
between
the
pages
up
the
steps
over
passages
then
iron
gates
were
opened
and
a
curtain
was
drawn
aside
and
psyche
stepped
into
the
golden
hall
of
the
tower
there
sat
emeralda
in
the
light
of
a
thousand
candles
on
a
throne
under
a
canopy
surrounded
by
a
great
retinue
holy
pilgrim
said
emeralda
be
welcome
you
have
come
to
bring
me
jewels
a
cold
shiver
ran
like
a
serpent
over
psyche
limbs
when
she
heard
emeralda
voice
she
had
not
thought
that
she
would
be
afraid
any
more
of
her
proud
sister
but
now
when
she
saw
her
and
heard
her
voice
she
almost
fainted
from
fear
for
her
look
was
most
terrible
emeralda
had
grown
older
but
she
was
still
beautiful
yet
her
beauty
was
horrible
in
the
hall
lit
up
with
thousands
of
candles
a
hall
of
gold
and
enamel
sat
emeralda
like
an
idol
on
her
throne
of
agate
in
a
niche
of
jasper
there
was
nothing
more
human
about
her
she
was
like
a
great
jewel
she
had
become
petrified
as
it
were
into
a
jewel
her
eyes
of
sharp
emerald
looked
out
from
her
face
that
was
ivory
white
like
chalcedony
from
her
crown
of
beryl
there
hung
down
her
face
six
red
plaits
of
hair
as
inflexible
as
and
stiffly
interwoven
with
emeralds
her
mouth
was
a
split
ruby
her
teeth
glittered
like
brilliants
her
voice
sounded
harsh
and
creaking
like
the
noise
of
a
machine
her
hands
and
inflexible
fingers
stiff
with
rings
were
with
blue
veins
such
as
run
through
the
opal
her
bosom
opal
chalcedonic
was
enclosed
in
a
bodice
of
violet
amethyst
and
over
the
bodice
she
wore
a
tunic
of
precious
stones
her
dress
was
no
longer
brocade
but
composed
of
jewels
all
the
arabesque
was
jewels
her
mantle
was
jewelled
so
stiffly
that
the
stuff
could
not
bend
but
hung
straight
down
from
her
shoulders
like
a
long
jewelled
clock
and
she
was
beautiful
but
beautiful
as
a
monster
preciously
beautiful
as
a
work
of
art
made
by
one
both
jeweller
and
artist
barbarously
beautiful
in
the
incrustations
of
her
crown
the
facets
of
her
eyes
the
lapis
lazuli
of
her
stiffly
folded
and
all
the
gems
and
cameos
which
bordered
her
mantle
and
dress
in
the
light
of
thousands
of
candles
she
glistened
a
barbarous
idol
and
shot
forth
rays
like
a
rainbow
representing
every
colour
dazzling
was
her
look
pitiless
and
soulless
proud
she
sat
and
motionless
glistening
with
lustre
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
her
splendour
and
covetous
her
grating
voice
said
again
eagerly
holy
pilgrim
welcome
you
have
come
to
bring
me
jewels
psyche
gained
courage
yes
she
said
in
a
firm
voice
powerful
majesty
of
the
past
i
come
to
do
you
homage
and
bring
you
jewels
but
i
beg
that
we
may
be
left
alone
emeralda
hesitated
but
when
psyche
remained
silent
her
cupidity
got
the
better
of
her
fear
and
she
gave
a
sign
she
raised
her
stiff
hand
and
by
that
single
movement
she
cracked
and
creaked
with
grating
jewels
and
shot
forth
rays
like
the
sun
which
like
a
nimbus
streamed
around
her
her
suite
disappeared
through
the
withdrew
psyche
stood
alone
before
her
sister
and
then
psyche
unfastened
the
cord
round
her
waist
and
took
off
her
mantle
her
long
hair
fell
about
her
and
she
was
naked
naked
she
stood
before
emeralda
and
said
emeralda
do
you
recognise
me
i
am
psyche
your
sister
a
cry
escaped
the
princess
she
rose
up
she
creaked
her
splendour
and
pomp
grated
and
she
glittered
so
that
psyche
was
dazzled
wretched
psyche
she
exclaimed
yes
i
know
you
i
have
always
hated
you
hated
as
i
hate
everything
that
is
gentle
as
i
hate
doves
children
flowers
so
you
have
deceived
me
intruder
you
bring
me
no
jewels
psyche
knelt
down
and
showed
her
open
hand
emeralda
i
offer
you
the
homage
which
i
once
refused
you
i
present
you
with
topazes
rubies
and
dark
purple
carbuncles
i
kneel
in
humility
before
you
i
offer
you
my
tears
which
have
turned
into
stone
and
i
ask
you
humbly
punish
me
and
give
me
a
penance
to
do
look
i
have
lost
my
wings
i
may
not
go
naked
any
longer
i
have
committed
sin
emeralda
make
me
do
penance
inflict
on
me
the
heaviest
that
you
can
think
of
if
i
can
do
it
i
will
do
it
lay
a
heavy
task
upon
my
wingless
shoulders
emeralda
looked
down
at
kneeling
psyche
the
princess
approached
her
sister
took
the
jewels
examined
them
attentively
held
them
up
to
the
light
of
the
candles
and
then
dropped
them
into
an
open
casket
thoughtfully
she
continued
gazing
at
psyche
and
she
seemed
to
psyche
like
a
gigantic
watching
from
the
midst
of
her
glittering
web
the
rays
of
her
own
splendour
but
whatever
she
were
princess
sun
spider
or
jewel
a
woman
she
was
not
a
human
being
she
was
not
and
through
the
opal
of
her
bosom
gleamed
her
heart
of
ruby
psyche
kneeling
penitent
spoke
not
awaiting
her
fate
and
emeralda
watched
her
thoughts
mechanical
as
wheels
rolled
through
her
brain
she
thought
as
a
machine
she
was
inexorable
because
she
had
no
feeling
she
thought
inhumanly
because
she
had
no
soul
soulless
she
was
and
hard
as
stone
but
she
was
powerful
the
mightiest
ruler
of
the
world
she
ruled
with
a
movement
she
condemned
with
a
look
she
could
kill
with
a
smile
if
she
spoke
a
word
it
was
terrible
if
she
appeared
in
public
there
was
disaster
and
if
she
rode
through
her
kingdom
in
a
triumphal
chariot
then
everything
was
scorched
by
her
lustre
and
crushed
under
her
triumph
at
last
she
spoke
motionless
like
a
spider
in
her
web
of
glittering
rays
and
her
voice
sounded
like
an
oracle
in
a
screeching
incantation
psyche
fled
from
her
father
house
fallen
from
all
princely
dignity
dethroned
princess
of
the
present
immoral
bacchante
corrupt
and
wingless
weeping
tears
of
scarlet
sin
listen
psyche
who
wandered
frivolously
to
purple
streaks
of
sky
who
longed
for
the
nothingness
of
azure
and
of
light
who
loved
a
horse
who
forsook
her
husband
who
wandered
and
sought
and
asked
in
desert
and
in
wood
wander
seek
and
ask
wander
seek
and
ask
till
you
find
wander
along
the
flaming
caves
seek
in
the
mouths
of
monsters
ask
of
the
martyred
spirits
who
roll
upon
the
inky
sea
descend
to
the
seek
the
mystic
jewel
the
stone
that
gives
the
highest
omnipotence
seek
the
mystic
jewel
the
rays
of
which
reach
to
eternity
and
penetrate
to
the
godhead
descend
wander
ask
seek
and
find
her
voice
grew
terrible
and
screeching
she
stepped
nearer
and
with
a
look
at
the
casket
said
pitilessly
or
weep
for
it
suffer
for
it
i
care
not
how
much
she
paused
and
then
in
a
voice
of
horrible
hypocrisy
continued
and
then
if
you
bring
me
the
sacred
jewel
the
name
of
which
may
not
be
uttered
she
drew
still
nearer
then
be
blessed
psyche
and
share
with
me
emeralda
your
sister
the
divine
omnipotence
like
an
oracle
sounded
her
hypocritical
voice
she
felt
in
psyche
an
unknown
power
she
feared
for
her
soul
and
wished
to
gain
that
power
for
herself
to
make
sure
of
the
omnipotence
of
the
world
both
soul
and
body
and
in
the
horrible
penance
which
she
laid
upon
psyche
she
feigned
tender
love
creaking
and
cracking
she
drew
nearer
and
in
her
web
of
rays
shed
a
sunbeam
over
her
kneeling
sister
and
with
her
stiff
opal
fingers
stroked
the
bent
head
with
its
fair
long
tresses
an
shiver
ran
through
psyche
as
if
her
burning
soul
were
being
frozen
i
obey
she
murmured
and
she
rose
up
intoxicated
from
splendour
stiff
from
icy
coldness
she
tottered
and
shut
her
eyes
when
she
opened
them
she
was
in
a
gloomy
clad
in
her
coarse
mantle
and
the
approached
with
torches
conduct
me
to
astra
she
commanded
there
was
something
strange
in
her
voice
which
made
them
obey
the
voice
of
a
princess
the
soft
voice
of
command
which
appealed
strangely
to
the
men
as
if
they
had
heard
it
when
they
were
pages
they
conducted
psyche
through
halls
over
passages
up
steps
to
another
tower
they
opened
low
doors
and
through
silent
vaults
guided
the
strange
pilgrim
rich
in
rubies
who
comes
there
asked
a
voice
tired
weak
and
faint
then
the
men
left
psyche
alone
and
she
was
with
astra
and
she
saw
her
sister
in
the
twilight
on
the
terrace
sitting
before
her
telescope
surrounded
by
globes
and
rolls
of
heavy
parchment
spread
out
and
psyche
saw
astra
looking
very
old
with
thin
grey
hair
which
hung
down
her
face
from
which
two
dull
eyes
stared
out
her
white
dress
hung
down
limp
on
her
sunken
shoulders
her
withered
breast
and
attenuated
limbs
bitter
dejection
was
in
her
dull
eyes
her
thin
hand
hung
down
powerless
tired
and
incapable
of
work
and
her
voice
faint
and
weak
said
who
comes
there
i
psyche
your
little
sister
come
back
o
astra
as
a
penitent
as
a
penitent
yes
i
fled

and

will
do
penance

mused
it
is
true
she
murmured
i

my
hand

the
night

telescope

the
centre
the
kernel
of
science
the
focus
of
brilliant
knowledge
now
i
am
blind
now
i
see
nothing

the
colossal
numbers

become
confused
in
my
brain

living
star
on
my
head

you
still

its
faint
splendour
between
my
grey
hair

her
gift
from
the
fairy

brought
her
prosperity
her
heart
of
ruby

no
pain
she
is
clad
in
the
majesty
of
precious
jewels

emeralda
has
laid
penance
on
you
to
seek
the
philosopher
stone
in
the
caverns
of
flaming
hell
o
psyche
the
stone
does
not
exist
the
unutterable
name
is
a
legend
the
jewel
exists
only
in
the
pride
of
man
the
universe
is
limited
the
godhead
is
not
limited
no
rays
from
precious
stones
can
reach
the
godhead
and
rule
over
god
no
looking
through
lenses
of
diamond
can
penetrate
the
godhead
it
is
all
pride
and
vanity
psyche
there
is
nothing
but
resignation
emeralda
is
powerful
but
more
powerful
she
can
not
become
in

but
resignation
there
is
nothing
but
to

vanity
and
pride
but

penance
is
illusion
yet
illusion

pleasant
illusion
ennobles
believe
poor
child
in
your
penance
believe
in
your
illusion
i
have
never
known
it
i
have
always
calculated
the
colossal
numbers
roll
through
my
dull
and
hazy
brain
in
endless
series
of
figures
however
you
count
you
never
come
to
the
sum
of
the
endless
the
stars
can
not
be
counted
the
farthest
sun
is
incomputable
the
divine
is
limitless
even
the
nearest
frontier
of
the
future
is
beyond
computation
there
is
a
sea
of
unfathomable
light
o
psyche
i
am
tired
i
am
blind
and
i
shall
soon
die
in
this
place
here
i
will
stay

look
through
the
telescope

the
night
too
dark
do
you

a
dim
light

through
the
telescope
what
do
you

tell
me
what
do

in
the
glass
right
at
the
top
i
see
a
dark
spot
which
emits
a
few
rays
is
that
a
black
star
no
psyche
that
is
a
spider
emeralda
has
sent
a
spider
the
spider
has
crawled
to
the
top
along
the
smooth
diamond
there
the
spider
weaves
his
web
and
the
diamond
is
crumbling
to
pieces
astra

closer
to
me

me
feel
your
little
round
head
your
wingless
shoulders

is
black

drifting
past
the
stars

thus
in
my
mantle

at
my
feet

my
little
child
and

yourself
for

now
by

feeling
for
psyche
she
threw
her
mantle
round
her
the
night
was
dark
astra
powerless
hand
dropped
over
psyche
psyche
fell
asleep
chapter
xxiii
it
was
still
dark
when
psyche
awoke
she
looked
up
at
astra
who
sat
sleeping
her
grey
head
on
her
breast
faintly
shone
her
star
very
gently
so
as
not
to
wake
her
psyche
rose
and
left
the
terrace
she
knew
the
way
she
went
through
the
halls
and
passages
down
the
steps
the
endless
steps
in
the
corners
sat
the
sacred
spiders
and
wove
psyche
went
lower
down
to
the
vaults
there
burnt
the
everlasting
lamps
she
went
among
the
royal
tombs
crystal
sarcophagi
and
found
her
father
coffin
by
the
lamp
which
was
always
kept
burning
she
recognised
his
embalmed
rigid
face
the
eyes
were
closed
he
knew
nothing
about
her
that
she
had
gone
away
and
come
back
death
was
between
them
and
severed
them
forever
she
kissed
the
glass
and
her
tears
round
hard
and
red
clattered
on
the
crystal
she
knelt
down
and
tried
to
pray
in
a
corner
of
the
vault
a
black
spot
moved
it
was
a
big
spider
with
a
white
cross
on
its
body
so
you
have
come
back
again
i
knew
that
you
would
come
we
can
escape
from
nothing
everything
happens
as
it
happens
everything
is
as
it
is
everything
goes
to
dust
into
the
pits
of
the
past
into
the
power
of
emeralda
now
become
a
spider
like
us
weave
your
web
and
be
wise
psyche
got
up
no
she
exclaimed
i
will
not
become
a
spider
i
will
weave
no
web
i
have
sinned
but
i
will
weave
no
web
i
have
sinned
and
will
do
penance
the
world
is
awful
desert
and
wood
and
space
life
is
awful
love
and
pain
joy
and
despair
sin
and
punishment
and
if
fate
is
as
it
is
it
is
in
vain
to
weave
a
web
and
to
heap
up
treasures
of
dust
spider
were
it
not
more
human
to
love
to
live
and
even
to
sin
than
to
weave
web
upon
web
spider
i
envy
you
not
your
sacredness
the
spider
puffed
itself
out
maliciously
you
seem
to
be
still
proud
of
your
murder
and
your
immorality
and
shamelessness
your
princely
name
you
have
dragged
through
the
mire
your
wings
you
have
given
up
for
a
panther
skin
and
a
and
know
not
yet
what
repentance
is
if
you
had
been
wise
and
become
a
spider
you
would
have
served
emeralda
and
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
go
down
to
the
but
psyche
was
no
longer
afraid
she
had
come
to
kiss
her
coffin
she
left
her
jewelled
tears
in
the
treasure
which
the
spiders
watched
over
and
ascended
the
hundreds
of
steps
and
came
on
to
the
terrace
of
the
battlements
there
as
a
child
she
had
wandered
and
gazed
a
child
with
wings
and
innocent
her
soul
full
of
dreams
now
she
wandered
again
along
the
ramparts
and
battlements
high
as
a
man
the
doves
fluttered
about
her
the
swans
looked
up
at
her
and
full
of
dejection
for
former
innocence
and
youth
she
wept
and
wept
no
longer
a
brook
but
topazes
rubies
tears
of
sin
that
rattling
down
frightened
the
doves
and
the
swans
which
indignant
thought
that
she
was
pelting
them
with
stones
the
doves
flew
away
and
the
swans
offended
turned
their
backs
on
her
then
she
sat
down
in
an
embrasure
no
wings
now
lay
against
the
and
she
folded
her
arms
round
her
knees
she
looked
towards
the
horizon
behind
it
loomed
other
horizons
first
pink
then
silver
blue
then
gold
behind
the
grey
pale
and
misty
and
then
fading
away
then
beyond
the
horizon
became
like
an
opal
and
in
the
reflection
of
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
it
seemed
as
if
lakes
were
mirrored
there
islands
rose
in
the
air
aerial
paradises
watery
streaks
of
blue
sea
oceans
of
ether
and
nothingness
and
psyche
bowed
her
head
full
of
sadness
and
sobbed
the
world
was
not
changed
but
more
beautiful
than
ever
gloriously
beautiful
loomed
the
horizon
yet
psyche
sobbed
full
of
sadness
she
knew
that
the
horizons
were
pure
delusions
and
that
behind
them
was
the
desert
with
the
sphinx
oh
if
she
could
once
more
believe
in
the
aerial
paradises
the
purple
seas
the
golden
regions
with
people
of
light
who
lived
under
rosy
bananas
alas
had
she
not
trod
a
paradise
the
sweet
present
the
adorable
garden
of
a
moment
so
little
and
so
short
in
duration
it
was
past
it
was
past
oh
how
her
soul
scorched
how
her
shoulders
pained
how
her
eyes
burned
she
wept
and
she
sobbed
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
she
did
not
notice
that
the
wind
was
rising
that
the
horizon
quivered
that
clouds
were
speeding
through
the
air
white
colossi
like
towers
and
dragons
riders
and
horses
she
did
not
see
the
changes
in
the
sky
she
did
not
see
the
going
up
and
down
of
wings
of
flaming
wings
in
the
silver
lightning
that
flashed
from
the
sky
she
did
not
hear
the
warning
thunder
nor
did
she
see
the
clouds
emitting
sparks
but
suddenly
she
distinctly
heard
a
voice
psyche
psyche
she
looked
up
before
her
she
saw
descending
on
broad
wings
a
steed
of
pure
light
and
flame
and
she
uttered
a
cry
that
sounded
in
the
air
like
an
endless
shout
of
gladness
chimera
it
was
he
he
descended
the
basalt
terrace
trembled
as
though
shaken
by
an
earthquake
under
his
hoofs
the
stone
shot
sparks
and
he
stood
before
her
resplendent
and
beautiful
chimera
she
cried
and
folded
her
hands
and
sank
down
before
him
on
her
knees
she
could
say
nothing
else
she
was
dazzled
and
it
seemed
as
though
her
soul
ascended
heavenward
in
the
pure
delight
of
love
psyche
sounded
his
voice
of
bronze
i
have
come
down
for
i
love
you
but
i
may
not
bear
you
any
more
on
my
back
through
the
delusive
regions
of
air
because
you
have
committed
sin
psyche
it
is
your
bounden
duty
to
obey
emeralda
command
go
down
to
hell
and
seek
the
jewel
chimera
adored
one
delight
of
my
soul
oh
your
splendour

the

is
quivering
with

and

and

psyche
sounded
his
voice
again
like
bronze
be
strong
take
heart
descend
do
penance
seek
once
more
you
will
see
me
once
more
be
strong
take
heart

he
ascended
whilst
psyche
remained
kneeling
when
he
was
high
in
the
air
there
came
a
peal
of
thunder
as
if
the
heavens
would
burst
asunder
the
sky
was
dark
but
lit
up
by
the
lightning
in
the
black
sky
in
the
lightning
flame
rose
fearfully
the
three
hundred
towers
and
the
rumbled
on
one
after
the
other
as
if
the
past
were
perishing
in
the
last
day
with
a
joyful
cry
psyche
hastened
along
the
terraces
the
battlements
ramparts
entered
the
castle
and
went
down
the
steps
lower
and
lower
she
descended
lower
than
the
vaults
and
as
she
passed
them
she
threw
a
kiss
in
the
direction
where
the
old
king
lay
buried
she
descended
still
lower
and
yet
she
heard
the
thunder
pealing
above
and
the
castle
seemed
to
tremble
to
its
very
foundations
she
descended
still
lower
she
descended
very
deep
pits
built
like
towers
reversed
to
the
central
nave
of
the
earth
she
descended
step
after
step
thousands
of
steps
groping
in
the
darkness
she
walked
with
unerring
foot
that
felt
for
the
next
step
that
detected
the
slippery
stone
she
felt
and
never
hesitated
another
step
and
then
another
again
a
pit
pit
after
pit
all
the
pits
of
the
past
bats
flew
up
and
flapped
their
wings
spiders
she
felt
crawling
over
her
an
icy
dampness
fell
like
a
chill
wind
upon
her
shoulders
deeper
down
she
went
and
deeper
it
was
pitch
dark
and
above
she
heard
nothing
more
she
heard
only
the
flapping
of
the
gigantic
bats
the
droning
of
the
envious
spiders
but
she
defended
herself
with
her
little
hand
as
she
descended
she
beat
about
her
beat
the
bats
away
seized
a
vampire
held
it
tightly
by
the
neck
and
strangled
it
her
foot
glided
over
toads
she
slipped
over
snakes
but
she
got
up
again
and
beat
the
bats
and
fought
with
the
vampires
the
chimera
had
so
inspired
her
with
strength
that
she
felt
strong
as
a
giant
young
and
courageous
he
had
filled
her
eyes
with
such
light
that
she
saw
him
in
the
darkness
in
the
pitchy
darkness
his
flaming
wings
were
distinctly
visible
and
on
she
went
descending
thick
clouds
of
dust
the
deepest
shadows
of
emeralda
transitoriness
rose
up
but
she
kept
breathing
never
hesitating
and
her
foot
felt
instinctively
the
next
step
and
she
struck
at
the
bats
and
fought
with
the
vampires
when
she
throttled
them
a
human
cry
was
heard
and
the
echo
sounded
a
thousand
times
like
the
anxious
cry
of
a
murder
but
she
was
not
afraid
she
kept
on
descending
she
kept
descending
at
last
she
felt
no
more
steps
but
voidness
under
her
feet
and
she
sank
like
a
feather
through
heavier
air
she
sank
she
sank
deeper
and
deeper
deeper
and
deeper
a
black
draught
of
air
an
invisible
wind
damp
and
chill
made
her
feel
that
she
had
passed
all
the
pits
that
she
was
sinking
outside
them
in
the
open
air
invisible
and
black
thick
as
ink
then
she
began
to
sink
more
slowly
and
her
feet
touched
ground
sounds
soft
and
low
like
the
plaintive
strains
of
a
viol
rose
up
from
afar
like
music
of
the
sea
the
plaint
of
a
thousand
voices
which
never
became
melody
the
sound
continued
quivering
as
an
accompaniment
of
wind
of
a
black
wind
which
blew
and
overpowered
the
music
of
the
sea
sometimes
it
went
a
little
higher
sometimes
a
little
lower
and
always
remained
the
vague
and
distant
incomprehensible
harmony
from
where
the
wind
came
from
where
the
plaintive
murmuring
arose
thither
would
psyche
go
and
with
her
foot
she
kept
feeling
and
with
her
outstretched
hands
and
on
she
went
long
long
she
went
in
the
darkness
till
the
darkness
became
less
opaque
and
lit
up
with
phosphoric
flickerings
and
she
saw
that
she
was
ascending
a
path
between
two
inky
seas
black
as
ink
were
the
waves
then
she
heard
them
roaring
then
she
saw
their
crests
lit
up
with
a
blue
phosphorescent
glow
then
she
heard
the
soft
low
sounds
the
plaintive
viols
swell
till
they
became
a
dull
continuous
soughing
the
black
wind
rose
as
with
a
gigantic
sail
and
suddenly
blew
the
hurricane
in
the
air
the
lightning
flashed
blue
and
between
the
two
inky
seas
psyche
went
slowly
on
against
the
gusts
of
wind
then
she
uttered
a
cry
as
though
she
were
calling
the
hurricane
took
her
cry
for
help
over
the
endless
sea
of
hell
and
from
all
sides
dived
up
the
gruesome
frights
leviathan
monsters
they
opened
their
jaws
at
psyche
and
the
water
streamed
out
their
scaly
tortuous
bodies
wound
along
over
the
black
surface
of
the
ocean
and
on
the
horizon
lit
up
with
phosphorous
blue
their
tails
meandered
they
came
from
the
horizon
they
dived
up
and
down
and
the
ocean
dived
with
them
waterfall
waterfall
they
spread
out
their
dragon
wings
and
caught
up
the
boisterous
wind
they
shot
up
waterspouts
like
towering
fountains
of
a
blue
and
yellowish
hue
their
round
squinting
eyes
stood
out
watchful
like
green
and
yellow
signals
they
lifted
their
jaws
abysses
of
desires
bubbling
with
foamy
slaver
monsters
of
the
sea
of
pain
where
shall
i
find
the
jewel
for
emeralda
psyche
asked
the
question
in
a
high
musical
key
and
her
voice
rang
out
clearly
in
the
hurricane
and
plaintive
moanings
of
the
sea
her
high
soprano
sounded
above
all
the
roaring
of
the
elements
and
plaintive
cries
and
three
times
she
repeated
the
question
monsters
of
the
sea
of
pain
where
shall
i
find
the
jewel
for
emeralda
the
leviathans
pressed
together
along
the
path
that
psyche
trod
but
amidst
the
noise
of
their
tossing
and
snorting
and
spouting
she
heard
the
plaintive
sea
swelling
the
sea
of
plaintive
voices
and
then
in
the
blue
phosphorescent
glow
between
the
monsters
she
saw
the
drowned
shades
heaving
to
and
fro
always
writhing
in
fear
always
drowning
in
the
inky
sea
the
everlasting
wailing
of
the
plaintive
sea
the
cry
of
souls
in
pain
the
gigantic
plaintive
viol
with
strings
ever
playing
vanity
vanity
did
she
hear
aright
it
was
one
single
sound
like
a
note
repeated
again
and
again
vanity
vanity
was
the
inexorable
answer
first
vague
as
a
dream
mystic
as
a
thought
sounding
more
distinctly
as
an
admonition
against
worldly
pride
and
so
distinct
did
the
sound
become
that
psyche
brave
psyche
who
feared
neither
vampire
nor
monster
of
the
deep
that
courageous
psyche
hesitated
and
felt
all
her
strength
giving
way
if
it
were
vanity
to
seek
to
ask
for
the
jewel
how
much
farther
should
she
go
should
she
go
back
she
looked
round
but
she
saw
what
made
her
soul
sink
within
her
she
saw
that
behind
her
step
the
seas
immediately
closed
till
they
became
one
single
sea
of
ink
she
saw
that
the
only
path
for
her
stretched
across
the
seas
that
behind
her
it
immediately
sank
away
she
could
not
go
back
she
must
go
on
and
she
buoyed
up
her
sinking
soul
she
went
on
and
in
a
high
soprano
voice
repeated
again
and
again
her
question
spirits
in
the
sea
of
pain
where
shall
i
find
the
jewel
for
emeralda
vanity
vanity
the
plaintive
viol
kept
trembling
and
the
same
sound
sounded
ever
the
unchangeable
answer
the
hurricane
was
no
longer
chill
but
warm
sultry
strangely
sultry
more
and
more
sultry
blew
the
everlasting
cyclone
the
kept
back
they
dived
again
below
the
sea
sank
with
them
the
shades
swayed
to
and
fro
in
waterfall
waterfall
and
hydras
came
sinuously
up
the
sea
no
longer
shone
with
phosphorescent
glow
but
was
quite
black
pitch
black
black
as
boiling
pitch
without
foam
and
without
light
and
kept
sending
up
a
discharge
of
miry
vaporous
matter
in
the
boiling
pitch
the
hydras
with
their
thousand
snaky
heads
kept
diving
up
swayed
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
the
pale
faces
of
the
shades
but
ever
sounded
the
plaintive
viol
and
ever
rang
forth
the
same
note
the
unchangeable
answer
to
shrill
question
hydras
of
the
sea
of
pain
spirits
in
the
sea
of
pain
where
shall
i
find
the
jewel
for
emeralda

vanity
the
pitch
seethed
and
hissed
and
steamed
it
was
no
longer
a
sea
of
water
no
longer
a
sea
of
pitch
it
was
a
sea
of
nothing
but
flame
flame
a
sea
of
fire
fire
and
flame
that
waved
from
the
horizon
where
a
single
streak
of
pale
light
appeared
in
the
black
flames
burned
the
shades
in
the
black
flames
wound
the
hydras
in
and
out
the
thick
smoke
shot
up
into
the
clouds
and
the
clouds
sent
it
back
again
spirits
in
the
flames
where
shall
i
find
the
jewel
for
emeralda
vanity
vanity
the
hurricane
kept
blowing
the
plaintive
viol
kept
trembling
and
ever
sounded
the
same
note
the
unchangeable
answer
but
scorchingly
more
scorchingly
blew
the
wind
like
a
tempest
from
a
sun
for
ever
doomed
the
black
night
now
assumed
a
aspect
like
purple
steam
the
clouds
drove
a
bloody
vapour
into
the
heavens
and
on
either
side
of
psyche
path
suddenly
shot
out
the
flaming
hurricane
of
the
sun
gigantic
purple
tongues
of
fire
scarlet
and
orange
the
lower
clouds
drove
them
back
and
when
psyche
looked
round
she
stood
in
a
flaming
fire
the
flaming
hurricane
seethed
round
her
behind
her
feet
the
path
was
on
fire
the
air
was
fire
but
psyche
whose
own
soul
was
on
fire
in
her
own
scorching
fire
of
remorse
felt
not
the
glowing
heat
and
she
saw
out
of
the
living
scarlet
craters
the
orange
caves
the
hellish
chimeras
working
up
their
sinuous
way
like
glowing
spirals
half
arabesque
half
beast
half
dragon
half
tail
flaming
they
spat
and
fanned
the
glowing
fire
and
riding
aloft
on
the
burning
hurricane
the
shades
swept
past
psyche
spirits
in
the
scarlet
flames
vanity
vanity
this
was
the
only
answer
that
sounded
afar
off
in
her
ears
the
answer
of
the
tortured
angry
spirits
which
in
the
strength
of
their
sin
and
passion
came
flying
up
from
the
craters
on
she
went
she
went
on
along
the
path
that
unfolded
before
her
how
confidently
she
went
on
how
calmly
why
was
she
not
afraid
oh
she
knew
too
much
to
be
afraid
and
not
to
go
on
in
confidence
was
the
answer
not
always
more
distinct
and
unchangeable
psyche
soul
breathed
freely
and
in
the
fire
around
her
her
own
fire
seemed
to
diminish
for
when
the
fire
round
her
became
yellower
pure
yellow
the
pure
golden
yellow
of
the
sun
then
she
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
as
though
she
knew
the
answer
spirits
in
the
sulphur
flames
spirits
in
the
sun
flames
she
smiled
smiling
she
hastened
on
with
joyful
voice
with
winged
step
and
so
rapidly
did
she
flee
along
the
path
smoothed
out
small
for
her
foot
that
behind
her
the
answer
could
scarcely
reach
her
vanity
vanity
oh
it
was
always
the
plaintive
viol
but
the
too
poignant
grief
was
tempered
with
melancholy
the
plaintive
sea
became
like
a
sea
of
melancholy
the
thousands
of
voices
were
full
of
melancholy
and
when
the
flames
became
less
dense
and
lighter
when
they
changed
from
sulphur
yellow
to
soft
azure
a
flaming
sea
of
azure
in
the
silent
dawning
moonlight
scenery
high
broad
blue
flaming
tongues
that
shot
from
the
moon
when
the
hellish
hurricane
no
longer
raged
but
gave
away
to
a
more
benign
breeze
then
psyche
asked
no
more
in
so
shrill
a
key
but
knowing
all
her
voice
murmured
dejectedly
spirits
in
the
azure
flames
where
shall
i
find
the
jewel
for
emeralda
the
melancholy
viol
vibrated
more
gently
the
spirits
rocking
to
and
fro
in
the
thin
blue
fire
sang
more
softly
that
is
vanity
psyche
that
is
vanity
she
uttered
her
jubilant
cry
and
hastened
on
with
uplifted
arms
through
the
azure
the
firmament
spread
out
in
higher
circles
and
formed
wider
spheres
the
flames
became
clearer
and
clearer
more
benignly
blew
the
breeze
and
pale
the
spirits
flitted
to
and
fro
pale
shades
with
melancholy
eyes
singing
their
song
of
painful
remembrances
and
the
spirits
looked
at
psyche
the
spirits
smiled
benignly
on
her
astonished
that
she
was
still
alive
they
pointed
for
her
to
go
on
farther
and
farther
they
nodded
to
her
on
on
and
she
gave
a
loud
cry
of
joy
and
hastened
on
she
sped
through
the
flames
and
shades
till
the
flames
were
still
and
high
and
white
high
still
white
flames
like
sacrificial
flames
like
altar
flames
high
in
the
sky
the
lofty
sky
the
wide
sky
the
wide
expanse
full
of
white
flame
still
white
ascending
purifying
flames
refined
and
clear
over
the
whole
wide
expanse
the
wide
refining
expanse
once
more
she
asked
the
pale
shades
who
swarmed
about
between
the
flames
hand
in
hand
who
swayed
continually
to
and
fro
between
the
flames
spirits
in
the
white
flames
pure
white
in
the
white
flames
where
shall
i
find
the
jewel
for
emeralda
vanity
vanity
sang
the
shades
softly
and
quietly
and
in
the
answer
calm
and
assuring
of
the
expectant
penitents
vibrated
the
great
viol
with
a
sound
like
a
soft
jubilant
trill
psyche
asked
no
more
she
slackened
her
speed
and
began
to
walk
her
arms
raised
her
head
erect
through
the
silvery
flames
oh
the
dear
tender
flames
the
adorable
purifying
flames
how
they
cooled
in
their
glow
the
burning
remorse
of
her
soul
how
freely
psyche
breathed
in
the
innocently
white
glowing
fire
like
lilies
were
the
tongues
of
flame
fragrant
and
soothing
as
balsam
cool
and
fresh
as
snow
cold
as
water
as
foam
the
white
flames
foamed
and
rippled
like
a
sea
lower
and
smoother
quieter
and
more
serene
they
rippled
like
a
sea
of
lilies
like
a
sea
of
silver
snow
they
became
moisture
and
water
and
foaming
ocean
the
tender
element
of
gentle
compulsion
carrying
along
as
an
irresistible
dream
white
as
paradise
and
as
slightly
rippling
waves
of
foam
they
bore
psyche
away
on
the
foaming
waves
psyche
drifted
along
all
white
in
the
golden
boat
of
her
fair
hair
so
gently
did
they
rock
her
the
foaming
rippling
waves
that
psyche
shut
her
eyes
sleep
was
stealing
over
her
her
lips
smiled
with
inward
peace
the
waves
bore
her
away
the
sea
washed
her
ashore
she
awoke
from
her
slumber
she
rose
from
the
foam
amidst
the
joyful
dolphins
she
stepped
out
of
the
sea
on
to
the
land
she
felt
quite
cool
and
her
soul
was
calm
and
peaceful
full
of
reassuring
holy
knowledge
but
within
her
was
a
great
desire
smiling
she
stretched
out
her
arms
she
yearned
for
the
desire
of
her
heart
not
yet
not
yet
was
whispered
tenderly
to
her
cool
and
peaceful
soul
wait
wait
sounded
the
echo
in
the
silent
joy
of
her
soul
she
wept
she
lifted
her
hand
to
her
eyes
wet
were
her
tears
and
in
her
hand
lay
a
pearl
then
she
looked
round
she
recognised
the
with
its
many
bays
the
shore
of
the
kingdom
of
the
past
there
on
the
horizon
loomed
a
town
of
minarets
and
pinnacles
of
cupolas
and
obelisks
surrounded
with
golden
walls
that
was
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
thither
she
would
repair
there
proud
and
peaceful
still
and
cool
she
would
say
to
emeralda
her
powerful
sister
that
her
jewel
was
vanity
that
the
gem
did
not
exist
chapter
xxiv
when
psyche
approached
the
capital
she
heard
at
the
gates
the
excited
cries
of
festive
outside
the
gates
flocked
the
noisy
crowd
dressed
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
bedecked
with
flowers
singing
and
dancing
but
not
knowing
why
everywhere
was
bustle
and
commotion
on
the
roadside
sat
hundreds
of
hucksters
and
women
extolling
their
wares
glasses
with
jewels
and
fruit
cooling
drinks
dresses
and
flowers
in
a
shrill
key
they
praised
their
wares
they
spread
out
their
stuffs
with
much
ado
and
offered
the
people
flowers
and
poured
them
out
wine
and
held
up
strings
of
glass
pearls
and
cheap
necklaces
of
coins
psyche
was
naked
and
she
veiled
herself
in
her
hair
she
spread
over
the
marks
on
her
shoulders
her
golden
mantle
of
hair
and
as
many
of
the
dancing
girls
some
half
naked
and
others
quite
danced
round
hand
in
hand
people
thought
that
she
was
naked
only
because
she
was
so
fair
psyche
so
in
her
golden
hair
she
was
not
wont
to
be
ashamed
of
nakedness
which
was
once
her
right
her
privilege
as
a
princess
but
now
under
the
eyes
of
the
people
she
blushed
and
walked
with
downcast
eyes
then
she
turned
to
a
saleswoman
and
asked
what
is
the
feast
for
where
do
you
come
from
is
the
feast
for
do
you
know
anything
about
it
i
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
sea
is
the
feast
for
it
is
the
great
festival
it
is
the
festival
the
of
emeralda
it
is
the
triumphal
procession
of
the
queen
it
is
the
triumphal
procession
of
the
queen
resounded
on
all
sides
they
danced
and
sang
it
is
the
triumphal
procession
of
the
queen
they
were
drunk
with
joy
dizzy
from
strange
joy
but
psyche
suddenly
saw
that
they
were
deadly
pale
and
frightened
deadly
pale
under
paint
and
flowers
and
frightened
whilst
they
danced
round
in
a
ring
i
have
no
dress
for
the
occasion
give
me
that
veil
of
golden
gauze
said
psyche
to
the
saleswoman
that
is
very
dear
i
will
pay
you
for
it
with
this
pearl
with
that
pearl
are
you
a
princess
then
psyche
then
took
the
veil
and
she
bound
it
round
her
loins
just
as
she
used
to
do
before
i
will
give
you
a
wreath
of
fresh
roses
as
well
said
the
woman
pleased
and
put
the
flowers
on
her
head
she
smiled
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
decked
out
with
those
flowers
as
a
victim
for
the
altar
that
all
the
people
who
were
making
merry
and
dancing
were
bedecked
as
victims
she
went
on
through
the
round
gold
gate
she
entered
the
city
the
squares
were
seen
in
the
distance
connected
with
very
broad
streets
square
palaces
of
marble
and
bronze
of
jasper
and
malachite
round
cupolas
and
finely
pointed
minarets
glistered
in
the
sun
as
if
conjured
up
by
magic
they
stretched
far
away
and
right
behind
the
blue
mountains
rose
the
royal
castle
a
babel
of
pinnacles
and
towers
innumerable
almost
indiscernible
in
the
distance
with
square
ramparts
and
walls
and
lofty
summits
lost
in
the
rising
mist
and
along
the
squares
over
palaces
and
on
the
minarets
hung
the
thick
festoons
of
flowers
as
though
the
towns
were
decked
out
for
an
offering
close
up
to
the
castle
babel
of
pinnacles
the
festoons
of
flowers
seemed
to
reach
and
in
the
squares
the
dancers
threw
flowers
into
the
air
and
it
seemed
as
if
white
roses
were
raining
down
from
heaven
to
the
sound
of
tabour
and
cymbals
the
people
danced
madly
round
and
ever
was
heard
the
same
cry
it
is
the
triumphal
procession
of
the
queen
then
psyche
in
the
secret
depths
of
her
heart
saw
clearly
and
indubitably
what
it
all
meant
as
she
went
along
with
the
dense
crowds
of
noisy
shouting
she
saw
all
the
people
in
the
town
trembling
with
fear
which
made
the
blood
congeal
in
their
veins
their
eyes
through
fear
were
ready
to
start
out
of
their
sockets
their
teeth
chattered
their
limbs
bedecked
with
flowers
trembled
the
sun
was
shining
but
everyone
was
shivering
with
cold
but
no
one
spoke
of
his
trembling
and
they
danced
madly
drunk
with
foolish
joy
and
they
kept
shouting
the
same
thing
it
is
the
triumphal
procession
of
the
queen
chapter
xxv
a
great
commotion
was
going
on
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
in
that
direction
all
eyes
were
turned
and
the
dancing
girls
forgot
to
dance
from
fear
the
crowd
stood
still
as
if
petrified
and
forgot
to
conceal
the
anxiety
of
their
minds
the
palaces
seemed
to
tremble
the
quivered
audibly
something
dreadful
was
about
to
happen
the
royal
castle
shone
with
a
strange
lustre
a
sun
seemed
to
send
forth
a
halo
an
ominous
aureola
appeared
in
the
distance
the
fearful
rays
of
the
sun
of
consternation
outshone
the
day
outshone
the
sun
from
their
centre
they
penetrated
through
houses
and
people
and
everything
shone
softened
by
the
glow
of
piercing
sunbeams
the
rays
quivered
everywhere
in
the
air
and
the
aureola
filled
the
world
the
cause
of
consternation
came
rattling
on
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
all
hearts
stood
still
all
breath
was
taken
away
all
dancing
was
stopped
all
rejoicing
ceased
from
the
castle
over
the
triumphal
way
a
triumphal
chariot
rattled
along
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
on
the
top
a
living
jewel
stood
emeralda
and
guided
the
four
and
twenty
steeds
it
was
her
splendour
and
her
aureola
which
appeared
in
the
air
it
was
her
rays
which
caused
the
houses
to
shine
with
splendour
and
pierced
the
people
with
flashes
she
stood
immovable
clad
in
the
strength
of
precious
stones
in
a
tunic
of
sapphire
in
a
robe
of
brilliants
with
deep
flounces
of
gems
and
white
cameos
her
mantle
was
like
a
bell
with
folds
of
purple
carbuncle
lined
with
enamelled
ermine
from
her
crown
of
beryl
from
her
heart
of
ruby
the
rays
shot
forth
shone
out
her
aureola
and
streamed
over
the
town
and
in
the
air
eclipsing
the
sun
which
turned
pale
her
eyes
of
emerald
stars
in
her
opal
face
chalcedonic
looked
inexorable
and
her
bosom
of
precious
stones
heaved
not
only
her
heart
of
ruby
beat
regularly
and
then
her
lustre
grew
alternately
dim
and
bright
she
stood
immovable
and
guided
her
horses
her
four
and
twenty
foaming
stallions
rearing
greys
which
drew
her
triumphal
car
like
a
broad
enamelled
shell
on
innumerable
wheels
on
cutting
wheels
so
numerous
that
they
seemed
to
run
into
one
another
a
turning
confusion
of
spokes
the
dazzling
chariot
rattled
on
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
and
suddenly
awaking
from
their
stupefaction
the
people
madly
danced
again
and
shouted
the
same
jubilant
cry
the
tabours
sounded
the
white
roses
rained
down
and
before
the
queen
the
people
prostrated
themselves
and
paved
her
path
with
their
bodies
the
grey
stallions
foamed
and
reared
they
came
on
they
came
on
they
trampled
over
the
first
bodies
men
and
women
girls
and
children
dressed
for
a
festival
and
bedecked
with
flowers
over
her
people
rode
emeralda
the
innumerable
wheels
rattled
a
confusion
of
spokes
revolving
cutting
furrows
in
flesh
and
blood
reducing
blood
and
human
flesh
to
a
muddy
mass
but
farther
up
they
danced
farther
up
they
sang
before
casting
themselves
down
for
her
triumph
then
emeralda
looking
over
her
triumphal
way
saw
with
the
keen
glance
of
her
black
carbuncle
pupil
a
little
form
naked
and
fair
who
lifted
up
her
small
child
hand
and
fiercer
and
fiercer
gleamed
her
heart
of
ruby
for
she
had
recognised
the
form
and
the
desire
flamed
up
in
her
the
thirst
for
more
power
and
to
become
like
a
god
emeralda
recognised
psyche
and
she
reined
in
her
twelve
pair
of
horses
she
drove
them
more
slowly
and
under
the
less
quickly
revolving
wheels
she
heard
the
jubilant
cry
of
the
dying
people
the
blood
dropped
from
the
wheels
but
the
roses
rained
down
and
covered
the
horrible
sight
on
the
bloody
muddy
mass
the
roses
rained
down
white
from
the
balconies
of
the
palaces
emeralda
stopped
under
her
death
was
silent
around
the
town
was
silent
she
alone
reigned
and
shot
out
her
terrible
fan
of
rays
which
scorched
the
houses
and
pierced
the
air
and
before
her
at
a
little
distance
stood
psyche
proud
crowned
with
roses
in
a
veil
of
gold
and
the
silent
crowd
recognised
in
her
the
third
princess
of
the
kingdom
psyche
said
emeralda
and
her
voice
sounded
loud
through
the
town
from
the
focus
of
her
rays
have
you
come
to
bring
me
the
unutterable
jewel
the
gem
of
power
the
bestower
of
universal
power
the
sacred
stone
of
mysticism
have
you
found
the
mystery
of
the
godhead
and
do
you
rule
with
me
the
universe
and
god
the
town
shuddered
and
quivered
the
people
were
stupefied
the
trembled
audibly
then
psyche
voice
sounded
clearly
from
the
consciousness
of
the
wisdom
and
sacred
knowledge
which
she
possessed
emeralda
for
you
i
have
gone
through
hell
along
the
black
seas
oceans
of
pitch
along
the
horrible
sloughs
of
flaming
hurricanes
along
the
craters
and
caverns
scarlet
and
yellow
along
the
azure
fires
and
through
the
white
and
lilac
glow
give
heed
to
what
i
say
hell
answered
when
i
asked
for
the
jewel
the
leviathans
roared
the
chimeras
hissed
the
spirits
cried
and
the
whole
plaintive
viol
trilled
do
you
understand
me
emeralda
your
wish
was
vanity
for
the
mystic
jewel
that
bestows
godlike
power
is
vanity
and
does
not
exist
then
it
was
terrible
the
queen
a
living
idol
burned
with
rage
blazed
with
rage
her
heart
was
inflamed
with
rage
around
her
decked
out
for
sacrifice
in
festive
garb
in
the
sunshine
and
her
own
dazzling
splendour
her
people
trembled
with
fear
and
cruelty
gleamed
in
her
fixed
face
her
emerald
eyes
started
so
revengefully
from
their
sockets
as
though
blinded
by
their
own
splendour
and
she
pulled
at
the
numerous
reins
the
horses
reared
the
white
roses
fell
down
the
people
screamed
with
joy
and
the
fear
of
death
and
the
triumphal
chariot
rattled
on
swift
as
an
arrow
it
thundered
on
over
the
people
who
paved
the
way
in
ecstacy
and
psyche
saw
the
maddened
horses
approaching
snorting
foaming
panting
trampling
pulling
their
eyes
round
and
mad
for
a
moment
she
stood
firm
proud
tall
in
the
sacred
knowledge
she
possessed
then
the
angry
hoofs
struck
her
down
and
the
horses
trampled
her
as
a
flower
emeralda
chariot
rattled
over
her
with
its
many
cutting
wheels
and
whilst
she
died
like
a
crushed
lily
trampled
in
her
own
she
thought
of
her
old
father
and
how
she
had
crept
to
his
breast
and
hidden
her
face
in
his
beard
before
she
went
to
sleep
at
night
she
died
but
while
she
lay
trampled
to
death
in
the
mud
of
human
flesh
and
blood
and
the
sacrificial
roses
kept
falling
down
over
her
corpse
unrecognisable
she
returned
to
life
hovering
through
the
air
and
felt
so
light
and
unencumbered
and
was
whiter
than
ever
and
naked
and
on
her
tender
shoulders
she
felt
two
new
wings
quivering
she
hovered
over
her
own
body
into
a
drifting
cloud
a
mist
of
fragrance
which
farther
on
she
lost
sight
of
and
light
white
and
rarefied
she
looked
wonderingly
at
her
trampled
body
and
laughed
strange
clear
and
childlike
sounded
her
laugh
in
the
cloud
and
vapoury
fragrance
chapter

the
triumphal
chariot
rattled
on
madly
emeralda
stretched
out
her
sceptre
on
the
top
of
which
glowed
a
star
of
destroying
rays
when
she
stretched
out
the
sceptre
and
directed
the
rays
she
scorched
monuments
palaces
and
parks
to
a
white
ash
and
for
her
cruel
jubilant
procession
she
cut
down
everything
that
came
in
her
way
the
thick
white
ashes
flew
up
like
dust
the
jubilant
multitude
were
scorched
the
palaces
of
jaspar
and
malachite
shrivelled
up
like
burnt
paper
the
breath
of
the
horses
blew
away
like
ash
the
white
burnt
gardens
and
right
over
everything
went
emeralda
scorching
as
she
went
powerful
foolish
arrogant
and
proud
she
was
and
more
unfeeling
than
ever
spiteful
and
cruel
hurt
in
her
pride
and
she
scorched
and
made
the
way
smooth
before
her
behind
her
lay
all
the
town
and
she
drove
through
her
kingdom
filling
the
air
with
her
rays
she
drove
through
valleys
and
burnt
up
the
harvest
she
reduced
villages
to
dust
she
dried
up
rivers
and
before
her
the
mountains
split
asunder
her
sceptre
made
a
way
for
her
and
no
law
of
nature
resisted
her
power
the
air
was
grey
with
the
clouds
of
ash
which
rained
down
upon
the
earth
she
went
along
as
swiftly
as
an
arrow
swiftly
as
lightning
swiftly
as
light
swiftly
as
thought
she
went
so
swiftly
that
in
a
single
hour
she
had
gone
all
round
her
wide
kingdom
intoxicated
with
the
pride
of
annihilation
and
she
drove
her
maddened
horses
through
endless
plains
of
sand
desert
after
desert
she
consumed
the
lions
fled
before
her
she
overtook
them
in
a
moment
clouds
of
sand
she
sent
up
into
the
air
but
then
she
relaxed
her
speed
she
stopped
before
her
grey
and
high
through
the
clouds
of
sand
and
falling
ash
there
loomed
a
most
dreadful
shadow
the
shadow
was
like
a
gigantic
beast
squatting
in
the
sand
with
a
woman
head
in
a
stiff
basalt
veil
the
woman
head
had
a
woman
breast
two
basalt
breasts
of
a
gigantic
woman
but
the
body
that
squatted
in
the
sand
was
a
lion
and
the
paws
stuck
out
like
walls
and
so
great
was
the
shadow
so
monstrous
the
beast
that
even
the
triumphal
chariot
of
emeralda
appeared

i

there

for
if

as
you

i
will
scorch
you
to
a
white

and
go
over
you
in

the
sphinx
was
silent
the
sphinx
looked
with
stony
eyes
at
the
clouds
of
sand
and
raining
ash
her
basalt
lips
remained
shut

said
emeralda
threateningly
and
red
with
rage
the
sphinx
spoke
not
and
looked
emeralda
stretched
out
her
sceptre
and
directed
the
destroying
rays
the
rays
split
on
the
basalt
with
crackling
sparks
like
flashes
of
forked
lightning
emeralda
uttered
a
cry
hoarse
and
terrible
she
threw
away
her
broken
sceptre
but
of
her
greater
power
she
did
not
doubt
and
for
the
last
time
she
threatened
terrible
sphinx
tremble
i
am
more
terrible
than
you
speak

the
sphinx
was
silent
then
emeralda
tugged
at
the
reins
the
maddened
horses
reared
snorting
foaming
panting
trampling
pulling
and
dashed
against
the
sphinx
but
the
foremost
horses
were
dashed
to
pieces
against
the
basalt
then
emeralda
uttered
cry
after
cry
one
hoarse
cry
after
another
which
resounded
through
the
desert
she
tugged
at
the
reins
the
horses
despairing
of
their
attack
against
the
immovable
drove
at
the
sphinx
and
fell
back
crushed
falling
over
one
another
and
trampling
one
another
to
death
the
triumphal
chariot
split
and
the
splinters
of
sparkling
jewels
flew
up
like
cracking
fireworks
and
emeralda
fell
between
the
still
revolving
wheels
and
her
heart
of
ruby
broke
all
her
dazzling
splendour
suddenly
faded
the
terrifying
aureola
suddenly
grew
dim
and
the
desert
was
grey
and
gloomy
with
a
gentle
rain
of
thick
white
ash
falling
down
the
sphinx
was
silent
and
looked
on
chapter
xxvii
psyche
was
alive
again
soaring
through
the
air
and
felt
so
light
and
ethereal
she
was
than
ever
and
naked
and
on
her
tender
shoulders
she
felt
two
new
wings
fluttering
she
hovered
away
over
her
own
dead
body
into
a
drifting
cloud
a
fragrant
mist
which
farther
on
she
lost
sight
of
and
light
white
and
ethereal
she
looked
with
wonder
at
her
trampled
corpse
and
laughed
strange
clear
and
childlike
sounded
her
laugh
in
the
cloud
and
vapoury
fragrance
psyche
she
heard
her
name
but
so
dazzled
and
astonished
was
she
that
she
did
not
see
then
the
wind
blew
about
her
the
cloud
moved
the
fragrance
ascended
like
incense
and
she
saw
many
like
herself
restored
to
life
hovering
in
the
fragrant
cloud
and
round
her
she
distinguished
the
outlines
of
faces
psyche
she
recognised
the
voice
deep
bronze
but
yet
strange
and
the
wind
blew
about
her
and
she
saw
a
bright
light
before
her
and
recognised
the
chimera
you
promised
me
once
more
exclaimed
psyche
joyfully
she
threw
herself
on
to
his
back
she
clung
to
his
mane
and
he
soared
aloft
where
am
i
said
psyche
who
am
i
what
has
happened
and
what
is
going
on
around
me

i
dead
or
do
i
live

rarefied
is
the
air
how
high

ascend

to
ascend
higher

dazzlingly
bright
about
us

that
water
or

strange
element

going
up
with
us

forms

is
the
viol

is
playing

joyous
sound

of
joy

little
circle

dot

circles

spheres

horizon

horizon

see
purple
sands
wrinkling
far
far
away
and
round
them
foams
a
golden
sea
we
saw
that
once
before
but
not
as
it
is
now
for
then
it
was
delusion
and
now

sands
are
growing
more
distinct

ripple
of
the
golden
sea

land
is

rainbow

that
the
land
of
happiness

future

be
a
delusion

the
future

is
the
land

at
it
well

is
wider
than
the
widest
sphere
wider
than
anything
i
can
think
of
where
are
the
limits
nowhere
how
far
and
how
wide
is
the
widest
sphere
immeasurably
far
indescribably
wide
and
what
stretches
away
round
the
widest
sphere

unutterable
and
the
all

the
the
i
know
no
names
on
earth
things

called
by
names

strand

light

light

beings
of
light
dwell
there

these

of
the
farthest

way

circles

the
chimera

forms
i
see
the
people
of
light
o
chimera
chimera
they
are
beckoning
us
they
are
waving
to
us

two
of
them

form
of
majesty
and
another
near

of
love

o

wings

you
not
go
faster

fly
too
slowly
for
me

fly
too
slowly
i
can
fly
faster
than
you
she
spread
out
her
tender
light
butterfly
wings
she
rose
above
the
breathless
winged
horse
and
she
flew
she
glided
over
the
chimera
head
toward
the
strand
toward
the
city
toward
the
blessed
spirits
there
she
saw
her
father
there
she
saw
eros
eros
godlike
and
naked
with
shining
wings
round
her
the
viol
of
joy
played
its
joyous
notes
as
if
all
the
spheres
rejoiced
together
in
the
divine
light
the
faces
of
the
cherubim
began
to
blossom
like
winged
roses
she
glided
swiftly
through
the
air
to
her
father
and
eros
and
embraced
them
she
laughed
when
she
saw
the
flaming
chimera
approaching
because
she
could
fly
faster
than
he
come
cried
eros
joyfully
and
he
wanted
to
take
her
to
the
gate
from
whence
sunbeams
issued
like
a
path
of
sunny
gold
a
path
along
which
enraptured
souls
were
going
hand
in
hand
but
the
kingly
shade
stopped
them
for
a
moment
when
they
eros
and
psyche
intoxicated
with
love
embraced
each
other
look
said
the
shade
look
down
below
they
saw
the
kingdom
of
the
past
with
their
glorified
minds
lying
visible
deep
in
the
funnel
of
the
spheres
they
saw
the
castle
fallen
to
ruins
with
a
single
tower
still
standing
they
saw
astra
old
grey
and
blind
sitting
before
her
telescope
and
gazing
in
vain
they
saw
her
star
flicker
up
for
a
moment
with
a
bright
and
final
light
then
they
saw
astra
blind
eyes
see
astra
looked
and
beheld
the
land
of
light
and
the
little
band
of
happy
loving
dear
ones
in
their
shining
raiment
then
they
heard
astra
murmur
there
there
the
land
the
kingdom
of
the
future
and
they
saw
her
star
extinguish
she
fell
back
dead
the
viol
of
gladness
trilled
