note
this
etext
was
produced
from
analog
july
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
a
spaceship
named
mcguire
by
randall
garrett
basic
trouble
with
mcguire
was
that
though
he
was
a
robot
spaceship
nevertheless
he
had
a
definite
weakness
that
a
man
might
understand
illustrated
by
douglas
no
nobody
ever
deliberately
named
a
spaceship
that
the
staid
and
stolid
minds
that
run
the
companies
which
design
and
build
spaceships
rarely
let
their
minds
run
to
fancy
the
only
example
i
can
think
of
is
the
unsung
hero
of
the
last
century
who
had
puckish
imagination
enough
to
name
the
first
submarine
such
minds
are
rare
most
minds
equate
dignity
with
dullness
this
ship
happened
to
have
a
magnetogravitic
drive
which
automatically
put
it
into
the
mg
class
it
also
happened
to
be
the
first
successful
model
to
be
equipped
with
a
yale
robotic
brain
so
it
was
given
the
designation
the
first
six
had
had
more
bugs
in
them
than
a
leopoldville
tenement
so
somebody
at
yale
another
unsung
hero
named
the
ship
mcguire
it
was
official
but
it
stuck
the
next
step
was
to
get
someone
to
mcguire
they
needed
just
the
right
man
tough
imaginative
and
a
whole
slew
of
complementary
adjectives
they
wanted
a
perfect
superman
to
test
pilot
their
baby
even
if
they
knew
they
eventually
have
to
take
second
best
it
took
the
yale
space
foundation
a
long
time
to
pick
the
right
man
no
i
not
the
guy
who
tested
the
mcguire
i
the
guy
who
stole
it
shalimar
ravenhurst
is
not
the
kind
of
bloke
that
very
many
people
can
bring
themselves
to
like
and
in
this
respect
i
like
a
great
many
people
if
not
more
so
in
the
first
place
a
man
has
no
right
to
go
around
toting
a
name
like
shalimar
it
makes
names
like
beverly
and
leslie
and
evelyn
sound
almost
hairy
chested
you
want
a
dozen
other
reasons
you
get
them
shalimar
ravenhurst
owned
a
little
planetoid
out
in
the
belt
a
hunk
of
about
the
size
of
a
smallish
mountain
with
a
measurable
in
fractions
of
a
centimeter
per
second
squared
if
susceptible
to
spacesickness
that
kind
of
gravity
is
about
as
much
help
as
aspirin
would
have
been
to
marie
antoinette
you
get
the
feeling
of
a
floor
beneath
you
but
there
a
distinct
impression
that
it
wo
be
there
for
long
it
keeps
trying
to
drop
out
from
under
you
i
dropped
my
flitterboat
on
the
landing
field
and
looked
around
without
any
hope
of
seeing
anything
i
did
the
field
was
about
the
size
of
a
football
field
a
bright
shiny
expanse
of
metal
carved
and
smoothed
flat
from
the
of
the
planetoid
itself
it
not
only
served
as
a
landing
field
but
as
a
reflector
beacon
a
mirror
that
flashed
out
the
sun
reflection
as
the
planetoid
turned
slowly
on
its
axis
i
homed
in
on
that
beacon
and
now
i
was
sitting
on
it
there
was
a
soul
in
sight
off
to
one
end
of
the
rectangular
field
was
a
single
dome
a
hemisphere
about
twenty
feet
in
diameter
and
half
as
high
nothing
else
i
sighed
and
flipped
on
the
magnetic
anchor
which
grabbed
hold
of
the
metal
beneath
me
and
held
the
flitterboat
tightly
to
the
surface
then
i
cut
the
drive
plugged
in
the
telephone
and
punched
for
local
the
automatic
finder
searched
around
for
the
ravenhurst
tickler
signal
found
it
and
sent
out
a
beep
along
the
same
channel
i
waited
while
the
thing
beeped
twice
there
was
a
click
and
a
voice
said
raven
rest
yes
it
was
ravenhurst
i
said
this
is
daniel
oak
i
want
to
talk
to
mr
ravenhurst
oak
but
you
were
expected
until
tomorrow
fine
i
early
let
me
talk
to
ravenhurst
but
ravenhurst
was
expecting
you
to
i
got
exasperated
unless
your
instruments
are
running
on
secondhand
flashlight
batteries
you
known
i
was
coming
for
the
past
half
hour
i
followed
ravenhurst
instructions
not
to
use
radio
but
he
should
know
i
here
by
this
time
he
told
me
to
come
as
fast
as
possible
and
i
followed
those
instructions
too
i
always
follow
instructions
when
i
paid
enough
now
i
here
tell
ravenhurst
i
want
to
talk
to
him
or
i
simply
flit
back
to
eros
and
thank
him
much
for
a
pretty
retainer
that
did
do
him
any
good
but
gave
me
a
nice
profit
for
my
trouble
one
moment
please
said
the
voice
it
took
about
a
minute
and
a
half
which
was
about
nine
billion
jiffies
too
long
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
then
another
voice
said
oak
was
expecting
you
till
tomorrow
so
i
hear
i
thought
you
were
in
a
hurry
but
if
you
not
you
can
just
provide
me
with
wine
women
and
other
necessities
until
tomorrow
that
above
and
beyond
my
fee
of
course
since
wasting
my
time
and
i
evidently
not
wasting
yours
i
could
be
sure
whether
the
noise
he
made
was
a
grunt
or
a
muffled
chuckle
and
i
did
much
care
sorry
oak
i
really
did
expect
you
so
soon
but
i
do
want
to
i
want
you
to
get
started
right
away
leave
your
flitterboat
where
it
is
i
have
someone
take
care
of
it
walk
on
over
to
the
dome
and
come
on
in
and
he
cut
off
i
growled
something
i
was
glad
he
did
hear
and
hung
up
i
wished
that
i
had
a
vision
unit
on
the
phone
i
like
to
have
seen
his
face
although
i
knew
i
might
not
have
learned
much
more
from
his
expression
than
i
had
from
his
voice
i
got
out
of
the
flitterboat
and
walked
across
the
dome
my
magnetic
soles
making
subdued
clicking
noises
inside
the
suit
as
they
caught
and
released
the
metallic
plain
beneath
me
beyond
the
field
i
was
surrounded
by
a
lumpy
horizon
and
a
black
sky
full
of
bright
hard
stars
the
green
light
was
on
when
i
reached
the
door
to
the
dome
so
i
opened
it
and
went
on
in
closing
it
behind
me
i
flipped
the
toggle
that
began
flooding
the
room
with
air
when
it
was
up
to
pressure
a
in
the
floor
of
the
dome
opened
and
a
blond
young
man
stuck
his
head
up
mr
oak
i
toyed
for
an
instant
with
the
idea
of
giving
him
a
sarcastic
answer
who
else
would
it
be
how
many
other
visitors
were
running
around
on
the
surface
of
raven
rest
instead
i
said
that
right
my
voice
must
have
sounded
pretty
muffled
to
him
through
my
fishbowl
come
on
down
oak
you
can
shuck
your
vac
suit
below
i
thought
below
was
a
pretty
ambiguous
term
on
a
lump
like
this
but
i
followed
him
down
the
ladder
the
ladder
was
a
necessity
for
fast
transportation
if
i
just
tried
to
jump
down
from
one
floor
to
the
next
it
would
taken
me
until
a
month
from
next
swithin
day
to
land
the
door
overhead
closed
and
i
could
hear
the
pumps
start
cycling
the
warning
light
turned
red
i
took
off
my
suit
hung
it
in
a
handy
locker
showing
that
all
i
had
on
underneath
was
my
union
suit
all
right
if
i
wear
this
i
asked
the
blond
young
man
or
should
i
borrow
a
set
of
shorts
and
a
jacket
most
places
in
the
belt
a
union
suit
is
considered
normal
dress
a
man
never
knows
when
he
might
have
to
climb
into
a
vac
suit
but
there
are
a
few
of
the
places
on
eros
and
ceres
and
a
few
of
the
other
places
where
a
man
or
woman
is
required
to
put
on
shorts
and
jacket
before
entering
and
in
good
old
new
york
city
a
man
and
woman
were
locked
up
for
indecent
exposure
a
few
months
ago
the
judge
threw
the
case
out
of
court
but
he
told
them
they
were
lucky
they
had
been
picked
up
in
boston
it
seems
that
the
eye
of
the
bluenose
turns
a
jaundiced
yellow
at
the
sight
of
a
union
suit
and
he
sees
red
but
there
were
evidently
no
bluenoses
here
perfectly
all
right
oak
the
blond
young
man
said
affably
then
he
coughed
politely
and
added
but
i
afraid
i
have
to
ask
you
to
take
off
the
gun
i
glanced
at
the
holster
under
my
armpit
walked
back
over
to
the
locker
opened
it
and
took
out
my
vac
suit
hey
said
the
blond
young
man
where
are
you
going
back
to
my
boat
i
said
calmly
i
getting
tired
of
this
runaround
already
i
a
professional
man
not
a
hired
flunky
if
you
called
a
doctor
you
would
tell
him
to
leave
his
little
black
bag
behind
if
you
called
a
lawyer
you
would
make
him
check
his
brief
case
or
if
you
did
he
tell
you
to
drop
dead
i
was
asked
to
come
here
as
fast
as
possible
and
when
i
do
i
told
to
wait
till
tomorrow
now
you
want
me
to
check
my
gun
the
hell
with
you
merely
a
safety
precaution
said
the
blond
young
man
worriedly
you
think
i
going
to
shoot
ravenhurst
maybe
do
be
an
idiot
i
started
climbing
into
my
vac
suit
just
a
minute
please
oak
said
a
voice
from
a
hidden
speaker
it
was
ravenhurst
and
he
actually
sounded
apologetic
you
blame
feller
those
are
my
standing
orders
and
i
failed
to
tell
feller
to
make
an
exception
in
your
case
the
error
was
mine
i
know
i
said
i
was
blaming
feller
i
was
even
talking
to
him
i
was
addressing
you
i
believe
you
feller
our
guest
has
gone
to
all
the
trouble
of
having
a
suit
made
with
a
space
under
the
arm
for
that
gun
i
see
no
reason
to
make
him
remove
it
a
pause
again
oak
i
apologize
i
really
want
you
to
take
this
job
i
was
already
taking
off
the
vac
suit
again
but
ravenhurst
continued
smoothly
if
i
fail
to
live
up
to
your
ideas
of
courtesy
again
i
hope
you
forgive
me
in
advance
sometimes
very
forgetful
and
i
do
like
it
when
a
man
threatens
to
leave
my
employ
twice
in
the
space
of
fifteen
minutes
i
not
in
your
employ
yet
ravenhurst
i
said
if
i
accept
the
job
i
wo
threaten
to
quit
again
unless
i
mean
to
carry
it
through
and
it
would
take
a
lot
more
than
common
discourtesy
to
make
me
do
that
on
the
other
hand
your
brand
of
discourtesy
is
a
shade
above
the
common
i
thank
you
for
that
at
least
said
ravenhurst
show
him
to
my
office
mr
feller
the
blond
young
man
nodded
wordlessly
and
led
me
from
the
room
walking
under
conditions
is
like
nothing
else
in
this
universe
i
do
mean
trotting
around
on
luna
gee
is
practically
homelike
in
comparison
and
zero
gee
is
so
devoid
of
orientation
that
it
gives
the
sensation
of
falling
endlessly
until
you
get
used
to
it
but
a
planetoid
is
in
a
different
class
altogether
remember
that
dream
almost
everybody
had
it
where
you
suddenly
able
to
fly
it
is
flying
exactly
it
a
sort
of
swimming
in
the
air
like
being
underwater
except
that
the
medium
around
you
is
so
dense
and
viscous
and
you
can
breathe
remember
well
that
the
feeling
you
get
on
a
planetoid
your
arms
do
tend
to
hang
at
your
sides
as
they
do
on
earth
or
luna
because
the
muscular
tension
tends
to
hold
them
out
just
as
it
does
in
but
there
is
still
a
definite
sensation
of
if
you
push
yourself
off
the
floor
you
tend
to
float
in
a
long
slow
graceful
arc
provided
you
do
push
too
hard
magnetic
soles
are
practically
a
must
i
followed
the
blond
feller
down
a
series
of
long
corridors
which
had
been
painted
a
pale
green
which
gave
me
the
feeling
that
i
was
underwater
there
were
doors
spaced
at
intervals
along
the
corridor
walls
occasionally
one
of
them
would
open
and
a
busy
looking
man
would
cross
the
corridor
open
another
door
and
disappear
from
behind
the
doors
i
could
hear
the
drum
of
distant
sounds
we
finally
ended
up
in
front
of
what
looked
like
the
only
wooden
door
in
the
place
when
you
carving
an
office
and
residence
out
of
a
planetoid
importing
wood
from
earth
is
a
purely
luxury
matter
there
was
no
name
plate
on
that
door
there
did
need
to
be
feller
touched
a
circle
in
the
door
jamb
you
do
knock
i
asked
with
mock
seriousness
no
said
feller
with
a
straight
face
i
have
to
signal
knocking
would
do
any
good
that
just
wood
veneer
over
a
steel
slab
the
door
opened
and
i
stepped
inside
i
have
never
seen
a
room
quite
like
it
the
furniture
was
all
that
same
mahogany
a
huge
desk
nineteenth
century
baroque
with
carved
and
curlicued
legs
two
chairs
carved
the
same
with
padded
seats
of
maroon
leather
and
a
chair
behind
the
desk
that
might
have
doubled
as
a
bishop
throne
with
even
fancier
carving
off
to
one
side
was
a
long
couch
upholstered
in
a
lighter
maroon
the
carpeting
was
a
rich
burgundy
with
a
pile
deep
enough
to
run
a
reaper
through
the
walls
were
paneled
with
mahogany
and
hung
with
a
couple
of
huge
tapestries
done
in
maroon
purple
and
red
a
bookcase
along
one
wall
was
filled
with
books
every
one
of
which
had
been
rebound
in
maroon
leather
it
was
like
walking
into
a
cask
of
old
claret
or
old
blood
the
man
sitting
behind
the
desk
looked
as
though
he
been
built
to
be
the
lightest
spot
in
an
analogous
color
scheme
his
suit
was
mauve
with
purple
piping
and
his
wide
square
saggy
face
was
florid
on
his
nose
and
cheeks
tiny
lines
of
purple
tracing
made
darker
areas
in
his
skin
his
hair
was
a
medium
brown
but
it
was
clipped
so
short
that
the
scalp
showed
faintly
through
and
amid
all
that
overwhelming
background
even
the
hair
looked
vaguely
violet
come
in
oak
said
shalimar
ravenhurst
i
walked
toward
him
across
the
burgundy
carpet
while
the
blond
young
man
discreetly
closed
the
door
behind
me
leaving
us
alone
i
blame
him
i
was
wearing
a
yellow
union
suit
and
i
hate
to
think
what
i
must
have
looked
like
in
that
room
i
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
facing
the
desk
after
giving
a
brief
shake
to
a
slightly
oily
hand
he
opened
a
crystal
decanter
that
stood
on
one
end
of
the
desk
have
some
madeira
oak
or
would
you
like
something
else
i
never
drink
spirits
at
this
time
of
night
i
fought
down
an
impulse
to
ask
for
a
shot
of
redeye
the
madeira
will
be
fine
mr
ravenhurst
he
poured
and
handed
me
a
stemmed
glass
nearly
brimming
with
the
wine
i
joined
him
in
an
appreciative
sip
then
waited
while
he
made
up
his
mind
to
talk
he
leaned
across
the
desk
looking
at
me
with
his
small
dark
eyes
he
had
an
expression
on
his
face
that
looked
as
if
it
were
trying
to
sneer
and
leer
at
the
same
time
but
could
get
much
beyond
the
smirk
stage
oak
i
have
investigated
you
thoroughly
as
thoroughly
as
it
can
be
done
at
least
my
attorneys
say
that
your
reputation
is
that
you
get
things
done
and
rarely
disappoint
a
client
he
paused
as
if
waiting
for
a
comment
i
gave
him
nothing
after
a
moment
he
went
on
i
hope
that
true
oak
because
going
to
have
to
trust
you
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
again
his
eyes
still
on
me
men
very
rarely
like
me
oak
i
am
not
a
likable
man
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
that
not
my
function
he
said
it
as
if
he
had
said
it
many
times
before
believed
it
and
wished
it
was
so
i
do
not
ask
that
you
like
me
he
continued
i
only
ask
that
you
be
loyal
to
my
interests
for
the
duration
of
this
assignment
another
pause
i
have
been
assured
by
others
that
this
will
be
so
i
would
like
your
assurance
if
i
take
the
assignment
ravenhurst
i
told
him
i
be
working
for
i
can
be
bought
but
once
i
bought
i
stay
bought
now
what
seems
to
be
your
trouble
he
frowned
well
now
let
get
one
thing
settled
are
you
working
for
me
or
not
i
wo
know
that
until
i
find
out
what
the
job
is
his
frown
deepened
now
see
here
this
is
very
confidential
work
what
happens
if
i
tell
you
and
you
decide
not
to
work
for
me
i
sighed
ravenhurst
right
now
you
paying
me
to
listen
to
you
even
if
i
do
take
your
job
i
going
to
bill
you
for
expenses
and
time
to
come
all
the
way
out
here
so
as
far
as
listening
is
concerned
i
working
for
you
now
if
i
do
like
the
job
still
forget
everything
i
told
all
right
he
did
like
it
but
he
had
no
choice
all
right
he
said
he
polished
off
his
glass
of
madeira
and
refilled
it
my
own
glass
was
still
nearly
full
oak
he
began
i
have
two
problems
one
is
minor
the
other
major
but
i
have
attempted
to
blow
the
minor
problem
up
out
of
proportion
so
that
all
the
people
here
at
raven
rest
think
that
it
is
the
only
problem
they
think
that
i
brought
you
out
here
for
that
reason
alone
but
all
that
is
merely
for
the
real
problem
which
is
i
prompted
he
leaned
forward
again
apparently
it
was
the
only
exercise
he
ever
got
you
aware
that
viking
spacecraft
is
one
of
the
corporations
under
the
management
of
ravenhurst
holdings
i
nodded
viking
spacecraft
built
some
of
the
biggest
and
best
spacecraft
in
the
system
it
held
most
of
ceres
all
of
it
in
fact
except
the
government
reservation
it
had
moved
out
to
the
asteroids
a
long
time
back
after
the
big
mining
concerns
began
cutting
up
the
smaller
asteroids
for
metal
the
raw
materials
are
easier
to
come
by
out
here
than
they
are
on
earth
and
it
a
devil
of
a
lot
easier
to
build
spacecraft
under
conditions
than
it
is
under
the
pull
of
earth
or
luna
or
mars
do
you
know
anything
about
the
experimental
robotic
ships
being
built
on
eros
ravenhurst
asked
not
much
i
admitted
i
heard
about
them
but
i
do
know
any
of
the
details
that
was
quite
true
but
i
found
it
does
pay
to
tell
everybody
everything
you
know
the
engineering
details
are
necessary
ravenhurst
said
besides
i
do
know
them
myself
the
point
is
that
viking
is
trying
to
build
a
ship
that
will
be
as
easy
to
operate
as
a
flitterboat
a
cargo
vessel
perhaps
even
a
completely
automatic
job
for
cargo
and
just
use
a
crew
for
the
passenger
vessels
imagine
how
that
would
cut
the
cost
of
transportation
in
the
solar
system
imagine
how
it
would
open
up
cargo
transfer
if
an
automatic
vessel
could
accelerate
at
twenty
or
gees
to
turnover
i
give
ravenhurst
this
he
had
a
light
in
his
eyes
that
showed
a
real
excitement
about
the
prospect
he
was
discussing
and
it
due
entirely
to
the
money
he
might
make
sounds
fine
i
said
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble
his
face
darkened
half
a
shade
the
company
police
suspect
sabotage
mr
oak
how
what
kind
illustration
they
do
know
viking
has
built
six
ships
of
that
type
the
mcguire
class
the
engineers
call
it
each
one
has
been
slightly
different
than
the
one
before
of
course
as
they
ironed
out
the
bugs
in
their
operation
but
each
one
has
been
a
failure
not
one
of
them
would
pass
the
test
for
not
a
failure
of
the
drive
or
the
ordinary
mechanisms
of
the
ship
i
take
it
ravenhurst
sniffed
of
course
not
the
brain
the
ships
became
as
you
might
say
compos
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
the
last
one
simply
tried
to
burrow
into
the
surface
of
eros
by
reversing
its
drive
one
of
the
roboticists
said
that
a
coroner
jury
would
have
returned
a
verdict
of
while
of
unsound
mind
if
there
were
inquests
held
for
spaceships
that
does
make
much
sense
i
said
no
it
does
it
is
sensible
those
ships
brains
should
have
behaved
that
way
robot
brains
do
go
mad
unless
they
given
instructions
to
do
so
conflicting
orders
erroneous
information
that
sort
of
thing
or
unless
they
have
actual
physical
defects
in
the
brains
themselves
the
brains
can
handle
the
job
of
flying
a
ship
all
right
though
i
asked
i
mean
they
have
the
capacity
for
it
certainly
they
the
same
type
that
used
to
control
the
automobile
traffic
on
the
eastern
seaboard
highway
network
of
north
america
if
they
can
control
the
movement
of
millions
of
cars
no
reason
why
they
ca
control
a
spaceship
no
i
said
i
suppose
not
i
thought
it
over
for
a
second
then
asked
but
what
do
your
robotics
men
say
is
causing
the
malfunctions
that
where
the
problem
comes
in
mr
oak
he
pursed
his
pudgy
lips
and
his
eyes
narrowed
the
opinions
are
divided
some
of
the
men
say
it
simply
a
case
of
engineering
failure
that
the
bugs
have
been
worked
out
of
this
new
combination
but
that
as
soon
as
they
are
everything
will
work
as
smoothly
as
butter
others
say
that
only
deliberate
tampering
could
cause
those
failures
and
still
others
say
that
there
not
enough
evidence
to
prove
either
of
those
theories
is
correct
but
your
opinion
is
that
it
sabotage
exactly
said
ravenhurst
and
i
know
who
is
doing
it
and
why
i
did
try
to
conceal
the
little
bit
of
surprise
that
gave
me
you
know
the
man
who
responsible
he
shook
his
head
rapidly
making
his
jowls
wobble
i
did
mean
that
it
not
a
single
man
it
a
group
maybe
you
better
go
into
a
little
more
detail
on
that
mr
ravenhurst
he
nodded
and
this
time
his
jowls
bobbled
instead
of
wobbled
some
group
at
viking
is
trying
to
run
me
out
of
the
managerial
business
they
want
viking
to
be
managed
by
thurston
enterprises
they
evidently
think
they
can
get
a
better
deal
from
him
than
they
can
from
me
if
the
mcguire
project
fails
they
have
a
good
chance
of
convincing
the
that
the
fault
lies
with
ravenhurst
you
follow
so
far
i
said
do
you
think
thurston
behind
this
then
i
do
know
he
said
slowly
he
might
be
or
he
might
not
if
he
is
that
perfectly
legitimate
business
tactics
he
got
a
perfect
right
to
try
to
get
more
business
for
himself
if
he
wants
to
undercut
him
a
couple
of
times
but
i
do
think
he
too
deeply
involved
if
he
involved
at
all
this
smacks
of
a
personal
attack
against
me
and
i
do
think
thurston
type
of
play
you
see
things
are
a
little
touchy
right
now
i
wo
go
into
details
but
you
know
what
the
political
situation
is
at
the
moment
it
works
this
way
as
far
as
viking
is
concerned
if
i
lose
the
managerial
contract
at
viking
a
couple
of
my
other
contracts
will
go
by
the
board
too
especially
if
it
proved
that
i
been
lax
in
management
or
have
been
expending
credit
needlessly
these
other
two
companies
are
actually
a
little
shaky
at
the
moment
i
only
been
managing
them
for
a
little
over
a
year
in
one
case
and
two
years
in
the
other
their
assets
have
come
up
since
i
took
over
but
they
still
dump
me
if
they
thought
i
was
reckless
how
can
they
do
that
i
asked
you
have
a
contract
do
you
certainly
they
would
break
it
but
they
likely
ask
the
government
inspectors
to
step
in
and
check
every
step
of
the
managerial
work
now
you
and
i
and
everybody
else
knows
that
you
have
to
cut
corners
to
make
a
business
successful
if
the
gi
step
in
that
will
have
to
stop
which
means
we
show
a
loss
heavy
enough
to
put
us
out
we
be
forced
to
sell
the
contract
for
a
pittance
well
then
if
viking
goes
and
these
other
two
corporations
go
it
begin
to
look
as
if
ravenhurst
ca
take
care
of
himself
and
his
companies
anymore
others
will
climb
on
the
bandwagon
contracts
that
are
coming
up
for
renewal
will
be
reconsidered
instead
of
continuing
automatically
i
think
you
can
see
where
that
would
lead
eventually
i
did
you
do
go
into
the
managing
business
these
days
unless
you
have
plenty
on
the
ball
you
got
to
know
all
the
principles
and
all
the
tricks
of
organization
and
communication
and
you
got
to
be
able
to
waltz
your
way
around
all
the
roadblocks
that
are
caused
by
government
laws
some
of
which
have
been
floating
around
on
the
books
of
one
nation
or
another
for
two
or
three
centuries
did
you
know
that
there
a
law
on
the
american
statute
books
that
forbids
the
landing
of
a
spaceship
within
one
hundred
miles
of
a
city
that
was
passed
back
when
they
were
using
rockets
but
it
never
been
repealed
technically
then
it
almost
impossible
to
land
a
ship
anywhere
on
the
north
american
continent
long
island
spaceport
is
openly
flouting
the
law
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way
a
managerial
combine
has
to
know
all
those
little
things
and
know
how
to
get
around
them
it
has
to
be
able
to
have
the
confidence
of
the
of
a
corporation
if
it
run
on
the
western
plan
or
the
confidence
of
communal
owners
if
it
run
on
the
eastern
plan
something
like
this
could
snowball
on
ravenhurst
it
is
only
the
rats
that
desert
a
sinking
ship
so
does
anyone
else
who
has
any
sense
what
i
want
to
know
oak
ravenhurst
continued
is
who
is
behind
this
plot
whether
an
individual
or
a
group
i
want
to
know
identity
and
motivation
is
that
all
i
eyed
him
skeptically
no
of
course
not
i
want
you
to
make
sure
that
the
sabotaged
i
want
you
to
make
sure
it
protected
from
whatever
kind
of
monkey
wrenches
are
being
thrown
into
its
works
it
nearly
ready
for
testing
now
is
it
i
asked
it
is
ready
it
seems
to
be
in
perfect
condition
so
far
viking
is
already
looking
for
a
test
pilot
it
still
in
working
order
now
and
i
want
to
be
certain
that
it
will
remain
so
i
cocked
my
head
to
one
side
and
gave
him
my
interrogative
and
suspicious
glance
number
in
the
manual
you
did
do
any
checking
on
the
first
six
mcguire
ships
you
wait
until
this
one
is
done
before
calling
me
why
the
delay
ravenhurst
it
did
faze
him
i
became
suspicious
after
mcguire
failed
i
put
colonel
brock
on
it
i
nodded
i
had
dealings
with
brock
he
was
head
of
security
guard
brock
did
get
anywhere
i
said
he
did
not
his
own
face
is
too
well
known
for
him
to
have
investigated
personally
and
he
not
enough
of
an
actor
to
get
away
with
using
a
plexiskin
mask
he
had
to
use
underlings
and
i
afraid
some
of
them
might
be
in
the
pay
of
the
ah
opposition
they
got
nowhere
in
other
words
you
may
have
spies
in
your
own
organization
who
are
working
with
the
viking
group
very
interesting
that
means
they
know
i
working
for
you
which
will
effectively
seal
me
up
too
you
might
as
well
have
kept
brock
on
the
job
he
smiled
in
a
smug
superior
sort
of
way
that
some
men
might
have
resented
i
did
even
though
i
fed
him
the
line
so
that
he
could
feel
superior
knowing
that
a
smart
operator
like
ravenhurst
would
already
have
covered
his
tracks
i
could
help
wishing
i
told
him
simply
to
trot
out
his
cover
story
instead
of
letting
him
think
i
believed
it
had
never
occurred
to
either
of
us
before
as
far
as
my
staff
knows
oak
you
are
here
to
escort
my
daughter
jaqueline
to
braunsville
luna
you
will
naturally
have
to
take
her
to
ceres
in
your
flitterboat
where
you
will
wait
for
a
specially
chartered
ship
to
take
you
both
to
luna
that
will
be
a
week
after
you
arrive
since
the
mcguire
is
to
be
tested
within
three
days
that
should
give
you
ample
time
if
it
does
we
will
consider
that
possibility
if
and
when
it
becomes
probable
i
have
a
great
deal
of
faith
in
you
thanks
one
more
thing
why
do
you
think
anybody
will
swallow
the
idea
that
your
daughter
needs
a
private
bodyguard
to
escort
her
to
braunsville
his
smile
broadened
a
little
you
have
not
met
my
daughter
oak
jaqueline
takes
after
me
in
a
great
many
respects
not
the
least
of
which
is
her
desire
to
have
things
her
own
way
and
submit
to
no
yoke
as
the
saying
goes
i
have
had
a
difficult
time
with
her
sir
a
difficult
time
it
is
and
has
been
a
matter
of
steering
a
narrow
course
between
the
scylla
of
breaking
her
spirit
with
too
much
discipline
and
the
charybdis
of
allowing
her
to
ruin
her
life
by
letting
her
go
hog
wild
she
is
seventeen
now
and
the
time
has
come
to
send
her
to
a
school
where
she
will
receive
an
education
suitable
to
her
potentialities
and
abilities
and
discipline
which
will
be
suitable
to
her
spirit
your
job
oak
will
be
to
make
sure
she
gets
there
you
are
not
a
bodyguard
in
the
sense
that
you
must
protect
her
from
the
people
around
her
quite
the
contrary
may
need
protection
from
you
are
to
make
sure
she
arrives
in
braunsville
on
schedule
she
is
perfectly
capable
of
taking
it
in
her
head
to
go
scooting
off
to
earth
if
you
turn
your
back
on
her
still
smiling
he
refilled
his
glass
do
have
some
more
madeira
oak
it
really
an
excellent
year
i
let
him
refill
my
glass
that
i
think
will
cover
your
real
activities
well
enough
my
daughter
will
of
course
take
a
tour
of
the
plant
on
ceres
which
will
allow
you
to
do
whatever
work
is
necessary
he
smiled
at
me
i
did
smile
back
up
till
now
this
sounded
like
a
pretty
nice
assignment
i
said
but
i
do
want
it
now
i
ca
take
care
of
a
teenage
girl
with
a
desire
for
the
bright
lights
of
earth
while
i
investigate
a
sabotage
case
i
knew
he
had
an
out
i
was
just
prodding
him
into
springing
it
he
did
of
course
not
my
daughter
is
not
as
scatterbrained
as
i
have
painted
her
she
is
going
to
help
you
me
exactly
you
are
ostensibly
her
bodyguard
if
she
turns
up
missing
you
will
of
course
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
find
her
he
chuckled
and
ceres
is
a
fairly
large
stone
i
thought
it
over
i
still
did
like
it
too
well
but
if
jaqueline
was
going
to
be
too
much
trouble
to
take
care
of
it
might
work
out
and
if
she
did
get
to
be
too
much
trouble
i
could
see
to
it
that
she
was
unofficially
detained
for
a
while
all
right
ravenhurst
i
said
you
got
yourself
a
man
for
both
jobs
both
i
find
out
who
is
trying
to
sabotage
the
mcguire
ship
and
i
for
you
that
two
jobs
and
you
going
to
pay
for
both
of
them
i
expected
to
said
shalimar
ravenhurst
fifteen
minutes
later
i
was
walking
into
the
room
where
i
left
my
vac
suit
there
was
a
girl
waiting
for
me
she
was
already
dressed
in
her
vac
suit
so
there
was
no
way
to
be
sure
but
she
looked
as
if
she
had
a
nice
figure
underneath
the
suit
her
face
was
rather
unexceptionally
pretty
a
sort
of
face
her
hair
was
a
reddish
brown
and
was
cut
fairly
close
to
the
skull
only
a
woman
who
never
intends
to
be
in
a
vac
suit
in
free
fall
can
afford
to
let
her
hair
grow
miss
ravenhurst
i
asked
she
grinned
and
stuck
out
a
hand
just
call
me
jack
and
i
call
you
dan
i
grinned
and
shook
her
hand
because
there
was
much
else
i
could
do
now
i
met
the
ravenhursts
a
father
called
shalimar
and
a
daughter
called
jack
and
a
spaceship
named
mcguire
i
gave
the
flitterboat
all
the
push
it
would
take
to
get
us
to
ceres
as
fast
as
possible
i
do
like
riding
in
the
things
you
sit
there
inside
a
transite
hull
which
has
two
bucket
seats
inside
it
fore
and
aft
astraddle
the
drive
tube
and
you
guide
from
one
beacon
to
the
next
while
you
keep
tabs
on
orbital
positions
by
radio
it
a
long
jump
from
one
rock
to
the
next
even
in
the
asteroid
belt
and
you
have
to
live
inside
your
vac
suit
until
you
come
to
a
stopping
place
where
you
can
spend
an
hour
or
so
resting
before
you
go
on
it
like
driving
in
an
automobile
except
that
the
signposts
and
landmarks
are
constantly
shifting
position
an
inexperienced
man
can
get
lost
easily
in
the
belt
i
was
happy
to
find
that
jack
ravenhurst
knew
how
to
handle
a
flitterboat
and
could
sight
navigate
by
the
stars
that
meant
that
i
could
sleep
while
she
piloted
and
the
trip
back
was
a
lot
easier
and
faster
than
the
trip
out
had
been
i
was
glad
in
a
way
that
ceres
was
within
flitterboat
range
of
raven
rest
i
do
like
the
time
wasted
in
waiting
for
a
regular
spaceship
which
you
have
to
do
when
your
target
is
a
quarter
of
the
way
around
the
belt
from
you
the
jumps
do
take
long
but
getting
to
a
ship
takes
time
the
ravenhurst
girl
was
much
of
a
talker
while
we
were
en
route
a
little
general
chitchat
once
in
a
while
then
she
clam
up
to
do
a
little
mental
orbit
figuring
i
did
mind
i
was
in
no
mood
to
pump
her
just
yet
and
i
was
usually
figuring
orbits
myself
you
get
in
the
habit
after
a
while
when
the
ceres
beacon
came
into
view
i
was
snoozing
jack
reached
forward
and
shook
my
shoulder
decelerating
toward
ceres
she
said
want
to
take
over
from
here
on
her
voice
sounded
tinny
and
tired
in
the
earphones
of
my
fishbowl
i
take
her
in
have
you
called
ceres
field
yet
not
yet
i
figured
that
you
better
do
that
since
it
your
flitterboat
i
said
and
called
ceres
they
gave
me
a
traffic
orbit
and
i
followed
it
in
to
ceres
field
it
was
a
lot
bigger
than
the
field
on
raven
rest
and
more
brightly
lit
and
a
lot
busier
but
it
was
basically
the
same
idea
a
broad
wide
smooth
area
that
had
been
carved
out
of
the
surface
of
the
with
a
focused
sun
beam
one
end
of
it
was
reserved
for
flitterboats
three
big
spaceships
sat
on
the
other
end
looking
very
at
the
little
flitterboats
i
clamped
down
gave
the
key
to
one
of
the
men
behind
the
desk
after
we
had
gone
below
and
turned
to
jack
i
suggest
we
go
to
the
hotel
first
and
get
a
shower
and
a
little
rest
we
can
go
out
to
viking
tomorrow
she
glanced
at
her
watch
like
every
other
watch
and
clock
in
the
belt
it
was
set
for
greenwich
standard
time
what
the
point
in
having
time
zones
in
space
i
not
tired
she
said
brightly
i
got
plenty
of
sleep
while
we
were
on
the
way
why
do
we
go
out
tonight
they
got
a
place
called
that
i
held
up
a
hand
no
you
may
not
be
tired
but
i
am
remember
i
went
all
the
way
out
there
by
myself
and
then
came
right
back
i
need
at
least
six
hours
sleep
in
a
nice
comfortable
bed
before
i
be
able
to
move
again
the
look
she
gave
me
made
me
feel
every
one
of
my
years
but
i
did
intend
to
let
her
go
roaming
around
at
this
stage
of
the
game
instead
i
put
her
aboard
one
of
the
little
rail
cars
and
we
headed
for
the
viking
arms
generally
considered
the
best
hotel
on
ceres
ceres
has
a
pretty
respectable
gee
pull
for
a
planetoid
three
per
cent
of
standard
i
weigh
a
good
hefty
five
pounds
on
the
surface
that
makes
it
a
lot
easier
to
walk
around
on
ceres
than
on
say
raven
rest
even
so
you
always
get
the
impression
that
one
of
the
little
rail
cars
that
scoots
along
the
corridors
is
climbing
uphill
all
the
way
because
the
acceleration
is
greater
than
any
measly
thirty
centimeters
per
second
squared
jack
did
say
another
word
until
we
reached
the
viking
where
ravenhurst
had
thoughtfully
made
reservations
for
adjoining
rooms
then
after
we
registered
she
said
we
could
at
least
get
something
to
eat
that
not
a
bad
idea
we
can
get
something
to
line
our
stomachs
anyway
steak
she
beamed
up
at
me
steak
sounds
wonderful
after
all
those
mushy
concentrates
let
go
the
restaurant
off
the
lobby
was
just
like
the
lobby
and
the
corridors
outside
a
big
room
hollowed
out
of
the
metal
of
the
asteroid
the
walls
had
been
painted
to
prevent
rusting
but
they
still
bore
the
roughness
left
by
the
sun
beam
that
had
burnt
them
out
we
sat
down
at
a
table
and
a
waiter
brought
over
a
menu
the
place
would
be
classed
higher
than
a
cafe
on
earth
but
on
ceres
it
considered
one
of
the
better
places
the
prices
certainly
compare
well
with
those
of
the
best
new
york
or
moscow
restaurants
and
the
price
of
meat
which
has
to
be
shipped
from
earth
is
you
should
pardon
the
gag
astronomical
that
did
bother
me
steaks
for
two
would
go
right
on
the
expense
account
i
mentally
thanked
ravenhurst
for
the
fine
slab
of
beef
when
the
waiter
finally
brought
it
while
we
were
waiting
though
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
said
awfully
quiet
jack
am
i
men
are
funny
is
that
meant
as
a
conversational
gambit
or
an
honest
observation
observation
i
mean
men
are
always
complaining
that
girls
talk
too
much
but
if
a
girl
keeps
her
mouth
shut
they
think
there
something
wrong
with
her
and
you
think
that
a
paradox
or
something
she
looked
puzzled
is
it
not
at
all
the
noise
a
jackhammer
makes
is
pleasant
at
all
but
if
it
does
make
that
noise
you
figure
it
is
functioning
properly
so
you
wonder
why
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
had
noticed
a
man
wearing
the
union
suit
of
ravenhurst
security
guard
coming
toward
us
from
the
door
using
the
gliding
shuffle
that
works
best
under
low
gee
i
ignored
him
to
listen
to
jack
ravenhurst
that
has
all
the
earmarks
of
a
dirty
crack
she
said
the
tone
of
her
voice
indicated
that
she
was
sure
whether
to
be
angry
or
to
laugh
hello
miss
ravenhurst
hi
oak
colonel
brock
had
reached
the
table
he
stood
there
smiling
his
rather
flat
smile
while
his
eyes
looked
us
both
over
carefully
illustration
he
was
five
feet
ten
an
inch
shorter
than
i
am
and
lean
almost
to
the
point
of
emaciation
his
scarred
face
looked
as
though
it
had
gotten
that
way
when
he
tried
to
kiss
a
crocodile
hello
brock
i
said
what
new
jack
gave
him
a
meaningless
smile
and
said
hello
colonel
she
was
obviously
not
very
impressed
with
either
of
us
mind
if
i
sit
brock
asked
we
did
so
he
sat
i
sorry
i
missed
you
at
the
spaceport
brock
said
seriously
but
i
had
several
of
my
boys
there
with
their
eyes
open
he
was
quite
obviously
addressing
jack
not
me
it
all
right
jack
said
i
not
going
anywhere
this
time
she
looked
at
me
and
gave
me
an
odd
grin
i
going
to
stay
home
and
be
a
good
girl
this
time
around
colonel
brock
chuckle
sounded
about
as
genuine
as
the
ring
of
a
lead
nickel
oh
you
no
trouble
miss
ravenhurst
thank
you
kind
sir
you
a
poor
liar
she
stood
up
and
smiled
sweetly
will
you
gentlemen
excuse
me
a
moment
we
would
and
did
colonel
brock
and
i
watched
her
cross
the
room
and
disappear
through
a
door
then
he
turned
to
look
at
me
giving
me
a
wry
grin
and
shaking
his
head
a
little
sadly
so
you
got
saddled
with
jack
the
ripper
eh
oak
is
she
that
bad
his
chuckle
was
harsher
this
time
and
had
the
ring
of
truth
find
out
oh
i
do
mean
she
got
the
morals
of
a
cat
or
anything
like
that
so
far
as
i
know
she
still
waiting
for
mister
right
to
come
along
drugs
i
asked
liquor
a
few
drinks
now
and
then
nothing
else
brock
said
no
it
none
of
the
usual
things
it
is
what
does
that
counts
it
what
she
talks
other
people
into
doing
she
a
convincer
that
sounds
impressive
i
said
what
does
it
mean
his
hard
face
looked
wolfish
i
ought
to
let
you
find
out
for
yourself
but
no
that
would
be
professional
courtesy
and
it
would
be
ethical
brock
i
said
tiredly
i
have
been
given
more
runarounds
in
the
past
week
than
mercury
has
had
in
the
past
millennium
i
expect
clients
to
be
cagey
to
hold
back
information
and
to
lie
but
i
did
expect
it
of
you
give
he
nodded
brusquely
as
i
said
she
a
convincer
a
talker
she
can
talk
people
into
doing
almost
anything
she
wants
them
to
for
instance
like
for
instance
getting
all
the
patrons
at
the
to
do
a
snake
dance
around
the
corridors
in
the
altogether
the
ceres
police
broke
it
up
but
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
said
it
so
innocently
that
i
knew
he
been
the
one
to
get
her
out
of
the
mess
and
the
time
he
continued
that
she
almost
succeeded
in
getting
a
welder
named
plotkin
elected
hereditary
czar
of
ceres
she
have
succeeded
too
if
she
had
made
the
mistake
of
getting
plotkin
himself
up
to
speak
in
front
of
his
loyal
supporters
after
that
everybody
felt
so
silly
that
the
movement
fell
apart
he
went
on
reciting
half
a
dozen
more
instances
of
the
girl
ability
to
influence
people
without
winning
friends
none
of
them
were
new
to
me
they
were
all
on
file
in
the
political
survey
division
of
the
united
nations
government
on
earth
plus
several
more
which
colonel
brock
either
neglected
to
tell
me
or
was
aware
of
himself
but
i
listened
with
interest
after
all
i
was
supposed
to
know
any
of
these
things
i
am
just
a
plain
ordinary
confidential
expediter
that
what
it
says
on
the
door
of
my
office
in
new
york
and
that
what
it
says
on
my
license
all
very
legal
and
very
dishonest
the
political
survey
division
is
very
legal
and
very
dishonest
too
theoretically
it
is
supposed
to
be
nothing
but
a
branch
of
the
system
census
bureau
it
is
supposed
to
do
nothing
but
observe
and
tabulate
political
trends
the
actual
fact
that
it
is
the
secret
service
branch
of
the
united
nations
government
is
known
only
to
relatively
few
people
i
know
it
because
i
work
for
the
political
survey
division
the
psd
already
had
men
investigating
both
ravenhurst
and
thurston
but
when
they
found
out
that
ravenhurst
was
looking
for
a
confidential
expediter
for
a
special
job
they
shoved
me
in
fast
it
is
easy
to
fool
sharp
operators
like
colonel
brock
but
so
far
been
lucky
enough
to
get
away
with
it
by
playing
the
steaks
were
brought
and
i
mentally
saluted
ravenhurst
as
i
had
promised
myself
i
would
then
i
rather
belatedly
asked
the
colonel
if
he
eat
with
us
no
he
said
with
a
shake
of
his
head
no
thanks
i
got
to
get
things
ready
for
her
visit
to
the
viking
plant
tomorrow
oh
hiding
something
i
asked
blandly
he
did
even
bother
to
look
insulted
no
just
have
to
make
sure
she
does
get
hurt
by
any
of
the
machinery
that
all
most
of
the
stuff
is
automatic
and
she
has
a
habit
of
getting
too
close
i
guess
she
thinks
she
can
talk
a
machine
out
of
hurting
her
as
easily
as
she
can
talk
a
man
into
standing
on
his
head
jack
ravenhurst
was
coming
back
to
the
table
i
noticed
that
fixed
her
hair
nicely
and
put
on
it
made
her
look
a
lot
more
feminine
than
she
had
while
she
was
on
the
flitterboat
well
she
said
as
she
sat
down
have
you
two
decided
what
to
do
with
me
colonel
brock
just
smiled
and
said
i
guess
we
have
to
leave
that
up
to
you
miss
ravenhurst
then
he
stood
up
now
if
you
excuse
me
i
be
about
my
business
jack
nodded
gave
him
a
quick
smile
and
fell
to
on
her
steak
with
the
voraciousness
of
an
unfed
chicken
in
a
wheat
bin
miss
jaqueline
ravenhurst
evidently
had
no
desire
to
talk
to
me
at
the
moment
on
ceres
as
on
most
of
the
major
planetoids
a
man
home
is
his
castle
even
if
it
only
a
hotel
room
raw
the
basic
building
material
is
so
cheap
that
walls
and
doors
are
seldom
made
of
anything
else
so
a
hotel
room
is
more
like
a
vault
than
anything
else
on
earth
every
time
i
go
into
one
of
the
hotels
on
ceres
or
eros
i
get
the
feeling
that
i
either
a
bundle
of
gold
certificates
or
a
particularly
obstreperous
prisoner
being
led
to
a
medieval
solitary
confinement
cell
they
not
pretty
but
they
jack
ravenhurst
went
into
her
own
room
after
flashing
me
a
rather
hurt
smile
that
was
supposed
to
indicate
her
disappointment
in
not
being
allowed
to
go
nightclubbing
i
gave
her
a
pat
on
the
shoulder
and
told
her
to
get
plenty
of
sleep
since
we
had
to
be
up
bright
and
early
in
the
morning
once
inside
my
own
room
i
checked
over
my
luggage
carefully
it
had
been
brought
there
from
the
spaceport
where
i
checked
it
before
going
to
ravenhurst
raven
rest
on
orders
from
ravenhurst
himself
this
was
one
of
several
rooms
that
ravenhurst
kept
permanently
rented
for
his
own
uses
and
i
knew
that
jack
kept
a
complete
wardrobe
in
her
own
rooms
there
were
no
bugs
in
my
luggage
neither
sound
nor
sight
spying
devices
of
any
kind
not
that
i
would
have
worried
if
there
had
been
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
anyone
was
crude
enough
to
try
that
method
of
smuggling
a
bug
into
the
apartment
the
door
chime
pinged
solemnly
i
took
a
peek
through
the
door
camera
and
saw
a
man
in
a
uniform
holding
a
large
traveling
case
i
recognized
the
face
so
i
let
him
in
the
rest
of
your
luggage
sir
he
said
with
a
straight
face
thank
you
very
much
i
told
him
i
handed
him
a
tip
and
he
popped
off
this
stuff
was
special
equipment
that
i
had
wanted
ravenhurst
or
anybody
else
to
get
his
paws
into
i
opened
it
carefully
with
the
special
key
slid
a
hand
under
the
clothing
that
lay
on
top
for
camouflage
and
palmed
the
little
detector
i
needed
then
i
went
around
the
room
whistling
gently
to
myself
the
nice
thing
about
an
room
is
that
it
impossible
to
hide
a
bug
in
it
that
will
be
of
any
use
a
small
concealed
broadcaster
ca
broadcast
any
farther
than
the
walls
so
any
bug
has
to
have
wires
leading
out
of
the
room
i
did
find
a
thing
either
ravenhurst
kept
the
room
clean
or
somebody
was
using
more
sophisticated
bugs
than
any
i
knew
about
i
opened
the
traveling
case
again
and
took
out
one
of
my
favorite
gadgets
it
a
simple
thing
really
a
noise
generator
but
the
noise
it
generates
is
noise
against
a
background
of
white
purely
random
noise
it
is
possible
to
pick
out
a
conversation
even
if
the
conversation
is
below
the
noise
level
simply
because
conversation
is
patterned
but
this
little
generator
of
mine
was
it
was
the
multiple
recording
of
ten
thousand
different
conversations
all
meaningless
against
a
background
of
white
noise
try
that
one
on
your
differential
analyzers
by
the
time
i
got
through
nobody
could
tap
a
dialogue
in
that
room
barring
as
i
said
bugs
more
sophisticated
than
any
the
united
nations
knew
about
then
i
went
over
and
tapped
on
the
communicating
door
between
my
room
and
jack
ravenhurst
there
was
no
answer
i
said
jack
i
coming
in
i
have
a
key
she
said
go
away
i
not
dressed
i
going
to
bed
grab
something
quick
i
told
her
i
coming
in
i
keyed
open
the
door
she
was
no
more
dressed
for
bed
than
i
was
unless
she
made
a
habit
of
sleeping
in
her
best
evening
togs
anger
blazed
in
her
eyes
for
a
second
then
that
faded
and
she
tried
to
look
all
sweetness
and
light
i
was
trying
on
some
new
clothes
she
said
innocently
a
lot
of
people
might
have
believed
her
the
emotional
field
she
threw
out
encouraging
utter
belief
in
her
every
word
was
as
powerful
as
any
i
ever
felt
i
just
let
it
wash
past
me
and
said
come
into
my
room
for
a
few
minutes
jack
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
did
put
any
particular
emphasis
into
it
i
do
have
to
she
came
once
we
were
both
inside
my
shielded
room
with
the
walls
vibrating
with
ten
thousand
voices
and
a
hush
area
in
the
center
i
said
patiently
jack
i
personally
do
care
where
you
go
or
what
you
do
tomorrow
you
can
do
your
vanishing
act
and
have
yourself
a
ball
for
all
i
care
but
there
are
certain
things
that
have
to
be
done
first
now
sit
down
and
listen
she
sat
down
her
eyes
wide
evidently
nobody
had
ever
beaten
her
at
her
own
game
before
tonight
you
stay
here
and
get
some
sleep
tomorrow
we
go
for
a
tour
of
viking
first
thing
in
the
morning
tomorrow
afternoon
as
soon
as
i
think
the
time
is
ripe
you
can
sneak
off
i
show
you
how
to
change
your
appearance
so
you
wo
be
recognized
you
can
have
all
the
fun
you
want
for
hours
i
of
course
will
be
hunting
high
and
low
for
you
but
i
wo
find
you
until
i
have
finished
my
investigation
on
the
other
hand
i
want
to
know
where
you
are
at
all
times
so
that
i
can
get
in
touch
with
you
if
i
need
you
so
no
matter
where
you
are
you
keep
in
touch
by
phoning
banning
every
time
you
change
location
got
that
number
she
nodded
banning
she
repeated
fine
now
brock
agents
will
be
watching
you
so
i
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
get
you
away
from
them
but
that
wo
be
too
hard
i
let
you
know
at
the
proper
time
meanwhile
get
back
in
there
get
ready
for
bed
and
get
some
sleep
you
need
it
move
she
nodded
rather
dazedly
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
she
turned
said
goodnight
in
a
low
puzzled
voice
and
closed
the
door
half
an
hour
later
i
quietly
sneaked
into
her
room
just
to
check
she
was
sound
asleep
in
bed
i
went
back
to
my
own
room
and
got
some
sack
time
myself
it
a
pleasure
to
have
you
here
again
miss
ravenhurst
said
chief
engineer
midguard
anything
in
particular
you
want
to
see
this
time
he
said
it
as
though
he
actually
enjoyed
taking
the
boss
teenage
daughter
through
a
spacecraft
plant
maybe
he
did
at
that
he
was
a
paunchy
graying
man
in
his
sixties
who
had
probably
been
a
rather
handsome
for
the
first
of
his
life
but
he
was
approaching
middle
age
now
which
has
a
predictable
effect
on
the
type
jack
ravenhurst
was
at
her
regal
best
with
the
kind
of
that
would
bring
worshipful
gratitude
to
the
heart
of
any
underling
oh
just
a
quick
on
whatever
you
think
would
be
interesting
midguard
i
do
want
to
take
up
too
much
of
your
time
midguard
allowed
as
how
he
had
a
few
interesting
things
to
show
her
and
the
party
which
also
included
the
watchful
and
taciturn
colonel
brock
began
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
viking
plant
there
were
three
ships
under
construction
at
the
time
two
cargo
vessels
and
a
passenger
job
midguard
seemed
to
think
that
every
step
of
spacecraft
construction
was
utterly
fascinating
for
which
bully
for
him
but
it
was
pretty
much
of
a
drag
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
it
took
three
hours
finally
he
said
would
you
like
to
see
the
why
yes
of
course
she
would
so
we
toddled
off
to
the
new
ship
while
midguard
kept
up
a
steady
line
of
patter
we
think
we
have
all
the
computer
errors
out
of
this
one
miss
ravenhurst
a
matter
of
new
controls
and
safety
devices
we
feel
that
the
trouble
with
the
first
six
machines
was
that
they
were
designed
to
be
operated
by
voice
orders
by
any
qualified
human
operator
the
trouble
is
that
they
had
no
way
of
telling
just
who
was
qualified
the
brains
are
perfectly
capable
of
distinguishing
one
individual
from
another
but
they
ca
tell
whether
a
given
individual
is
a
space
pilot
or
a
janitor
in
fact
i
marked
the
salient
points
in
his
speech
the
would
be
strictly
a
ship
it
had
a
dog
attitude
friendly
toward
all
humans
but
loyal
only
to
its
master
of
course
it
was
likely
that
the
ship
would
outlast
its
master
so
its
loyalties
could
be
changed
but
only
by
the
use
of
special
switching
keys
the
robotics
boys
still
were
sure
why
the
first
six
had
gone
insane
but
they
were
fairly
certain
that
the
primary
cause
was
the
matter
of
too
many
masters
the
brilliant
biophysicist
asenion
who
promulgated
the
three
laws
of
robotics
in
the
last
century
had
shown
in
his
writings
that
they
were
unattainable
ideals
that
they
only
told
what
a
perfect
robot
be
not
what
a
robot
actually
was
illustration
the
first
law
for
instance
would
forbid
a
robot
to
harm
a
human
being
either
by
action
or
inaction
but
as
asenion
showed
a
robot
could
be
faced
with
a
situation
which
allowed
for
only
two
possible
decisions
both
of
which
required
that
a
human
being
be
harmed
in
such
a
case
the
robot
goes
insane
i
found
myself
speculating
what
sort
of
situation
what
sort
of
asenion
paradox
had
confronted
those
first
six
ships
and
whether
it
had
been
by
accident
or
design
not
that
the
mcguire
robots
had
been
built
in
strict
accord
with
the
laws
of
robotics
that
was
impossible
on
the
face
of
it
but
no
matter
how
a
perfectly
logical
machine
is
built
the
human
mind
can
figure
out
a
way
to
goof
it
up
because
the
human
mind
is
capable
of
transcending
logic
the
mcguire
ship
was
a
little
beauty
a
nice
sleek
needle
capable
of
atmospheric
as
well
as
spatial
navigation
with
a
surface
all
over
the
feet
of
her
or
his
length
it
was
standing
upright
on
the
surface
of
the
planetoid
a
shining
needle
in
the
shifting
sunlight
limned
against
the
darkness
of
space
we
looked
at
it
through
the
transparent
viewport
and
then
took
the
flexible
tube
that
led
to
the
air
lock
of
the
ship
the
ship
was
just
as
beautiful
inside
as
it
was
outside
neat
compact
and
efficient
the
control
room
if
such
it
could
be
called
was
like
no
control
room
i
ever
seen
before
just
an
acceleration
couch
and
observation
instruments
midguard
explained
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
a
pilot
to
run
the
ship
any
person
who
knew
a
smattering
of
astronavigation
could
get
to
his
destination
by
simply
telling
the
ship
what
he
wanted
to
do
jack
ravenhurst
took
in
the
whole
thing
with
interest
is
the
brain
activated
mr
midguard
she
asked
oh
yes
we
been
educating
him
for
the
past
month
pumping
information
in
as
rapidly
as
he
could
record
it
and
index
it
finished
with
that
stage
now
we
just
waiting
for
the
selection
of
a
test
pilot
for
the
final
shakedown
cruise
he
was
looking
warily
at
jack
as
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
something
evidently
he
knew
what
was
coming
i
like
to
talk
to
him
jack
said
it
so
interesting
to
carry
on
an
intelligent
conversation
with
a
machine
i
afraid
that
impossible
miss
ravenhurst
midguard
said
rather
worriedly
you
see
mcguire
primed
so
that
the
first
man
voice
he
hears
will
be
identified
as
his
master
it
what
we
call
the
reaction
you
know
the
first
moving
thing
a
bird
sees
is
regarded
as
the
mother
and
once
implanted
that
order
ca
be
rescinded
we
can
change
mcguire
orientation
in
that
respect
but
we
rather
not
have
to
go
through
that
after
the
test
pilot
establishes
contact
you
can
talk
to
him
all
you
want
when
will
the
test
pilot
be
here
jack
asked
still
as
sweet
as
sucrodyne
within
a
few
days
it
looks
as
though
a
man
named
nels
bjornsen
will
be
our
choice
you
may
have
heard
of
him
no
she
said
but
i
sure
your
choice
will
be
correct
midguard
still
felt
apologetic
well
you
know
how
it
is
miss
ravenhurst
we
ca
turn
a
delicate
machine
like
this
over
to
just
anyone
for
the
first
trial
he
has
to
be
a
man
of
good
judgment
and
fast
reflexes
he
has
to
know
exactly
what
to
say
and
when
to
say
it
if
you
follow
me
oh
certainly
certainly
she
paused
and
looked
thoughtful
i
presume
you
taken
precautions
against
anyone
stealing
in
here
and
taking
control
of
the
ship
midguard
smiled
and
nodded
wisely
certainly
communication
with
mcguire
ca
be
established
unless
and
until
two
keys
are
used
in
the
activating
panel
i
carry
one
colonel
brock
has
the
other
neither
of
us
will
give
his
key
up
to
anyone
but
the
accredited
test
pilot
and
mcguire
himself
will
scream
out
an
alarm
if
anyone
tries
to
jimmy
the
locks
he
his
own
burglar
alarm
she
nodded
i
see
a
pause
well
midguard
i
think
you
done
a
very
commendable
job
thank
you
so
much
is
there
anything
else
you
feel
i
should
see
well
he
was
smilingly
hesitant
if
there
anything
else
you
want
to
see
i
be
glad
to
show
it
to
you
but
you
already
seen
our
ah
de
so
to
speak
she
glanced
at
her
wrist
it
had
been
over
four
hours
since
started
i
am
rather
tired
jack
said
and
hungry
too
let
call
it
a
day
and
go
get
something
to
eat
fine
fine
midguard
said
i
be
honored
to
be
your
host
if
i
may
we
could
have
a
little
something
at
my
apartment
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
had
a
full
lunch
prepared
and
waiting
the
girl
acknowledged
his
invitation
and
accepted
it
brock
and
i
trailed
along
like
the
bodyguards
we
were
supposed
to
be
i
wondered
whether
or
not
brock
suspected
me
of
being
more
than
i
appeared
to
be
if
he
did
he
was
stupider
than
i
thought
on
the
other
hand
he
could
never
be
sure
i
was
worried
about
his
finding
out
that
i
was
a
united
nations
agent
that
was
a
pretty
remote
chance
brock
even
know
the
united
nations
government
a
secret
service
it
was
unlikely
that
he
would
suspect
me
of
being
an
agent
of
a
presumably
nonexistent
body
but
he
could
very
easily
suspect
that
i
had
been
sent
to
check
on
him
and
the
thurston
menace
and
if
he
had
any
sense
he
actually
did
i
was
going
to
give
him
any
verification
of
that
suspicion
if
i
could
help
it
midguard
had
an
apartment
in
the
executive
territory
of
the
viking
reservation
a
fairly
large
place
with
walls
instead
of
the
usual
painted
very
luxurious
for
ceres
the
meal
was
served
with
an
air
of
subdued
pretension
that
made
everybody
a
little
stiff
and
uncomfortable
with
the
possible
exception
of
jack
ravenhurst
and
the
definite
exception
of
myself
i
just
listened
politely
to
the
strained
courtesy
that
passed
for
small
talk
and
waited
for
the
chance
i
knew
would
come
at
this
meal
after
the
eating
was
all
over
and
we
were
all
sitting
around
with
cigarettes
going
and
wine
in
our
glasses
i
gave
the
girl
the
signal
we
had
agreed
upon
she
excused
herself
very
prettily
and
left
the
room
after
fifteen
minutes
i
began
to
look
a
little
worried
the
bathroom
was
only
a
room
away
we
were
in
a
dining
area
and
the
bathroom
was
just
off
the
main
bedroom
and
it
should
have
taken
her
that
long
to
brush
her
hair
and
powder
her
face
i
casually
mentioned
it
to
colonel
brock
and
he
smiled
a
little
do
worry
oak
even
if
she
does
walk
out
of
this
apartment
my
men
will
be
following
her
wherever
she
goes
i
have
a
report
within
one
minute
after
she
left
i
nodded
apparently
satisfied
i
been
relying
on
that
i
said
otherwise
i
have
followed
her
to
the
door
he
chuckled
and
looked
pleased
ten
minutes
after
that
even
he
was
beginning
to
look
a
little
worried
maybe
we
better
go
check
he
said
she
might
have
hurt
herself
or
or
become
midguard
looked
flustered
now
just
a
minute
colonel
i
ca
allow
you
to
just
barge
in
on
a
young
girl
in
the
ah
bathroom
especially
not
miss
ravenhurst
brock
made
his
decision
fast
i
give
him
credit
for
that
get
miss
pangloss
on
the
phone
he
snapped
she
just
down
the
corridor
she
come
down
on
your
orders
at
the
same
time
he
got
to
his
feet
and
made
a
long
jump
for
the
door
he
grabbed
the
doorpost
as
he
went
by
swung
himself
in
a
new
orbit
and
launched
himself
toward
the
front
door
knock
on
the
bathroom
door
oak
he
bawled
as
he
left
i
did
a
long
low
flat
dive
toward
the
bedroom
swung
left
and
brought
myself
up
sharply
next
to
the
bathroom
door
i
pounded
on
the
door
miss
ravenhurst
jack
are
you
all
right
no
answer
good
there
should
have
been
colonel
brock
fired
himself
into
the
room
and
braked
himself
against
the
wall
any
answer
no
my
men
outside
say
she
has
left
he
rapped
sharply
on
the
door
with
the
butt
of
his
stun
gun
miss
ravenhurst
is
there
anything
the
matter
again
no
answer
i
could
see
that
brock
was
debating
on
whether
he
should
go
ahead
and
charge
in
by
himself
without
waiting
for
the
female
executive
who
lived
down
the
way
he
was
still
debating
when
the
woman
showed
up
escorted
by
a
couple
of
the
colonel
uniformed
guards
miss
pangloss
was
one
of
those
brisk
efficient
who
had
no
fuss
or
frills
about
her
she
had
seen
us
knocking
on
the
door
so
she
did
bother
to
do
any
knocking
herself
she
just
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
bathroom
was
empty
again
as
it
should
be
all
hell
broke
loose
then
with
me
and
brock
making
most
of
the
blather
it
took
us
nearly
ten
minutes
to
find
that
the
only
person
who
had
left
the
area
had
been
an
elderly
thin
man
who
had
been
wearing
the
baggy
protective
clothing
of
a
maintenance
man
by
that
time
jack
ravenhurst
had
been
gone
more
than
forty
minutes
she
could
be
almost
anywhere
on
ceres
colonel
brock
was
furious
and
so
was
i
sneered
openly
at
his
assurance
that
the
girl
could
leave
and
then
got
sneered
back
at
for
letting
other
people
do
what
was
supposed
to
be
my
job
that
phase
only
lasted
for
about
a
minute
though
then
colonel
brock
muttered
she
must
have
had
a
plexiskin
mask
and
a
wig
and
the
maintenance
clothing
in
her
purse
as
i
recall
it
was
a
fairly
one
he
did
say
a
word
about
how
careless
i
had
been
to
let
her
put
such
stuff
in
her
purse
all
right
he
went
on
we
find
her
i
going
to
look
around
too
i
said
i
keep
in
touch
with
your
office
i
got
out
of
there
i
got
to
a
public
phone
as
fast
as
i
could
punched
banning
and
said
marty
any
word
not
yet
i
call
back
i
hung
up
and
scooted
out
of
there
i
spent
the
next
several
hours
pushing
my
weight
around
all
over
ceres
as
the
personal
representative
of
shalimar
ravenhurst
who
was
manager
of
viking
spacecraft
which
was
in
turn
the
owner
of
ceres
i
had
a
lot
of
weight
to
push
around
i
had
every
executive
on
the
planetoid
jumping
before
i
was
through
colonel
brock
of
course
was
broiling
in
his
own
juices
he
managed
to
get
hold
of
me
by
phone
once
by
calling
a
perelson
whom
i
was
interviewing
at
the
time
the
phone
chimed
perelson
said
excuse
me
and
went
to
answer
i
could
hear
his
voice
from
the
other
room
daniel
oak
yes
he
here
well
yes
oh
all
sorts
of
questions
colonel
perelson
voice
was
both
irritated
and
worried
he
says
miss
ravenhurst
is
missing
is
that
so
oh
well
does
this
man
have
any
right
to
question
me
this
way
asking
me
about
everything
how
well
i
know
the
girl
the
last
time
i
saw
her
things
like
that
good
heavens
we
hardly
met
he
was
getting
exasperated
now
but
does
he
have
the
authority
to
ask
these
questions
oh
yes
well
of
course
i
be
glad
to
in
any
manner
i
can
yes
yes
all
right
i
call
him
i
got
up
from
the
angle
i
been
making
with
the
wall
and
shuffled
across
the
room
as
perelson
stuck
his
head
around
the
corner
and
said
it
for
you
he
looked
as
though
someone
had
put
aluminum
hydrogen
sulfate
in
his
mouthwash
i
picked
up
the
receiver
and
looked
at
brock
face
in
the
screen
he
did
even
give
me
a
chance
to
talk
what
are
you
trying
to
do
he
shouted
explosively
trying
to
find
jaqueline
ravenhurst
i
said
as
calmly
as
i
could
oak
you
a
maniac
why
by
this
time
it
all
over
ceres
that
the
boss
daughter
is
missing
shalimar
ravenhurst
will
have
your
hide
for
this
he
will
i
gave
him
number
the
innocent
stare
why
why
you
idiot
i
thought
you
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
this
should
be
kept
quiet
she
pulled
this
stunt
before
and
we
always
managed
to
quiet
things
down
before
anything
happened
we
managed
to
keep
everything
under
cover
and
out
of
the
public
eye
ever
since
she
was
fifteen
and
now
you
blow
it
all
up
out
of
proportion
and
create
a
furore
that
wo
ever
be
forgotten
he
gave
his
speech
as
though
it
had
been
written
for
him
in
full
caps
with
three
exclamation
points
after
every
sentence
and
added
gestures
and
grimaces
after
every
word
just
doing
what
i
thought
was
best
i
said
i
want
to
find
her
as
soon
as
possible
well
stop
it
now
let
us
handle
it
from
here
on
in
then
i
lowered
the
boom
now
listen
brock
i
am
in
charge
of
jack
ravenhurst
not
you
i
lost
her
and
i
find
her
welcome
your
and
i
hate
to
have
to
fight
you
but
if
you
do
like
the
way
i
handling
it
you
can
just
tell
your
boys
to
go
back
to
their
regular
work
and
let
me
handle
it
alone
without
interference
now
which
it
be
he
opened
his
mouth
closed
it
and
blew
out
his
breath
from
between
his
lips
then
he
said
all
right
the
damage
has
been
done
anyhow
but
do
think
i
wo
report
all
this
to
ravenhurst
as
soon
as
i
can
get
a
beam
to
raven
rest
that
your
job
and
your
worry
not
mine
now
have
you
got
any
leads
none
he
admitted
then
i
go
out
and
dig
up
some
i
let
you
know
if
i
need
you
and
i
cut
off
perelson
was
sitting
on
his
couch
with
an
expression
that
indicated
that
the
ph
of
his
saliva
was
hovering
around
one
point
five
i
said
that
will
be
all
perelson
thank
you
for
your
and
i
walked
out
into
the
corridor
leaving
him
with
a
baffled
look
at
the
next
public
phone
i
dialed
the
banning
number
again
any
news
not
from
her
she
has
reported
in
at
all
i
did
figure
she
would
what
else
just
as
you
said
he
told
me
with
some
cute
frills
around
the
edges
ten
minutes
ago
a
crowd
of
kids
sixteen
to
age
range
about
forty
of
started
a
songfest
and
football
game
in
the
corridor
outside
colonel
brock
place
the
boys
he
had
on
duty
there
recognized
the
jack
ravenhurst
touch
and
tried
to
find
her
in
the
crowd
nothing
doing
not
a
sign
of
her
that
girl
not
only
got
power
i
said
but
she
bright
as
a
solar
flare
agreed
she
headed
up
toward
midguard
place
now
i
do
know
what
she
has
in
mind
but
it
ought
to
be
fun
to
watch
where
midguard
now
i
asked
hovering
around
brock
as
we
figured
he
worried
and
feels
responsible
because
she
disappeared
from
his
apartment
as
predicted
well
i
stirred
up
enough
fuss
in
this
anthill
to
give
them
all
the
worries
they
need
tell
me
what
the
overall
effect
close
to
perfect
it
slightly
scandalous
and
very
mysterious
so
everybody
keeping
an
eye
peeled
if
anyone
sees
jaqueline
ravenhurst
they
run
to
a
phone
and
naturally
she
been
spotted
by
a
dozen
different
people
in
a
dozen
different
places
already
you
got
both
brock
company
guards
and
the
civil
police
tied
up
for
a
while
fine
but
be
sure
you
keep
the
boys
who
are
on
her
tail
shifting
around
often
enough
so
that
she
does
spot
them
do
worry
your
thick
little
head
about
that
dan
he
said
they
know
their
business
are
you
afraid
they
lose
her
no
i
not
and
you
know
it
i
just
do
want
her
to
know
being
followed
if
she
ca
ditch
her
shadow
she
likely
to
try
to
talk
to
him
and
pull
out
all
the
stops
convincing
him
that
he
should
go
away
you
think
she
could
with
boys
no
but
if
she
tries
it
it
mean
she
knows
she
being
followed
that
make
it
tougher
to
keep
a
man
on
her
trail
besides
i
want
her
to
try
to
convince
him
and
fail
graben
on
the
off
chance
that
she
does
spot
one
and
gives
him
a
good
talking
to
i
pass
along
the
word
that
the
victim
is
to
walk
away
meekly
and
get
lost
good
i
said
but
i
rather
she
did
know
she
wo
you
getting
touchy
dan
to
me
you
rather
be
doing
that
job
yourself
and
think
nobody
can
handle
it
but
you
i
gave
him
my
best
grin
you
are
closer
than
you
know
i
lay
off
you
handle
your
end
of
it
and
i
handle
mine
a
fair
exchange
is
no
bargain
go
and
sin
no
more
i
buzz
you
back
before
i
go
in
i
said
and
hung
up
playing
games
inside
a
crowded
asteroid
is
not
the
same
as
playing
games
in
say
honolulu
or
vladivostok
especially
when
that
game
is
a
combination
of
and
the
trouble
is
lack
of
communication
radio
contact
is
strictly
inside
a
hunk
of
metal
radar
beams
can
get
a
little
farther
but
a
man
has
to
be
an
expert
billiards
player
to
bank
a
reflecting
beam
around
very
many
corners
and
even
that
would
depend
upon
the
corridors
being
empty
which
they
never
are
to
change
the
game
analogy
again
it
would
be
like
trying
to
sink
a
putt
across
times
square
on
new
year
eve
following
somebody
is
anywhere
near
as
easy
as
popular
fiction
might
lead
you
to
believe
putting
a
tail
on
someone
whose
spouse
wants
divorce
evidence
is
relatively
easy
but
even
the
best
detectives
can
lose
a
man
by
pure
mischance
if
the
tailee
for
instance
walks
into
a
crowded
elevator
and
the
automatic
computer
decides
that
the
car
is
filled
to
the
limit
the
man
who
tailing
him
will
be
left
facing
a
closed
door
something
like
that
can
happen
by
accident
without
any
design
on
the
part
of
the
tailee
illustration
if
you
use
a
large
squad
of
agents
all
in
radio
contact
with
one
another
that
kind
of
loss
can
be
reduced
to
near
zero
by
simply
having
a
man
covering
every
possible
escape
route
but
if
the
tailee
knows
or
even
suspects
that
he
being
followed
wants
to
get
away
from
his
tail
and
has
the
ability
to
reason
moderately
well
it
requires
an
impossibly
large
team
to
keep
him
in
sight
and
if
that
team
has
no
fast
medium
of
communication
licked
at
the
onset
in
this
case
we
were
fairly
certain
of
jack
ravenhurst
future
actions
and
so
far
our
prophecies
had
been
correct
but
if
she
decided
to
shake
her
shadows
fun
would
be
had
by
all
and
as
long
as
i
had
to
depend
on
someone
else
to
do
my
work
for
me
i
was
going
to
be
just
the
teenchiest
bit
concerned
about
whether
they
were
doing
it
properly
i
decided
it
was
time
to
do
my
best
to
imitate
a
particle
and
put
on
a
little
speed
through
the
corridors
that
ran
through
the
subsurface
of
ceres
my
vac
suit
was
in
my
hotel
room
one
of
the
other
agents
had
picked
it
up
from
my
flitterboat
and
packed
it
carefully
into
a
small
attaché
case
i
planned
my
circuit
so
that
i
be
near
the
hotel
when
things
came
to
the
proper
boil
so
i
did
a
lot
of
diving
breaking
all
kinds
of
traffic
regulations
in
the
process
i
went
to
my
room
grabbed
the
attaché
case
checked
it
over
quickly
never
trust
another
man
to
check
your
vac
suit
for
you
and
headed
for
the
surface
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
me
when
i
walked
out
of
the
air
lock
onto
the
spacefield
there
were
plenty
of
people
moving
in
and
out
going
to
and
from
their
ships
and
boats
it
was
until
i
reached
the
edge
of
the
field
that
i
realized
that
i
had
my
hand
with
colonel
brock
it
was
only
by
the
narrowest
hair
but
that
had
been
enough
to
foul
up
my
plans
there
were
guards
surrounding
the
perimeter
with
radar
search
beams
as
i
approached
one
of
the
guards
walked
toward
me
and
made
a
series
of
gestures
with
his
left
hand
two
fingers
up
fist
two
fingers
up
fist
three
fingers
up
i
set
my
suit
phone
for
the
guy
right
hand
was
on
the
butt
of
his
stun
gun
sorry
sir
came
his
voice
we
ca
allow
anyone
to
cross
the
field
perimeter
emergency
my
name
oak
i
said
tiredly
daniel
oak
what
is
going
on
here
he
came
closer
and
peered
at
me
then
oh
yes
sir
i
recognize
you
we
uh
he
waved
an
arm
around
uh
looking
for
miss
ravenhurst
his
voice
lowered
conspiratorially
i
could
tell
that
he
was
used
to
handling
the
ravenhurst
girl
with
silence
and
suede
gloves
up
i
asked
well
colonel
brock
is
a
little
worried
he
says
that
miss
ravenhurst
is
being
sent
to
a
school
on
luna
and
does
want
to
go
he
got
to
thinking
about
it
and
he
afraid
that
she
might
try
to
leave
ceres
sneak
off
you
know
i
knew
we
got
a
guard
posted
at
the
airlocks
leading
to
the
field
but
colonel
brock
is
afraid
she
might
come
up
somewhere
else
and
jump
overland
i
see
i
said
i
had
realized
that
brock
was
that
close
to
panic
what
was
eating
him
there
must
be
something
but
i
could
figure
it
even
the
intelligence
corps
of
the
political
survey
division
ca
get
complete
information
every
time
after
all
if
he
did
want
the
girl
to
steal
a
flitterboat
and
go
scooting
off
into
the
velvet
all
he
have
to
do
would
be
to
guard
the
flitterboats
i
turned
slowly
and
looked
around
it
seemed
as
though
he
done
that
too
and
then
my
estimation
of
brock
suddenly
leaped
up
way
up
just
a
guard
at
each
flitterboat
would
do
she
could
talk
her
way
into
the
boat
and
convince
the
guard
that
he
really
should
tell
anyone
that
she
had
gone
by
the
time
he
realized
he
been
conned
she
be
thousands
of
miles
away
and
since
a
boat
guard
would
have
to
assume
that
any
approaching
person
be
the
boat
legitimate
owner
he
have
to
talk
to
whomever
it
was
that
approached
but
a
perimeter
guard
would
be
able
to
call
out
an
alarm
if
anyone
came
from
the
outside
without
having
to
talk
to
them
and
the
guards
watching
the
air
locks
undoubtedly
had
instructions
to
watch
for
any
female
that
even
vaguely
matched
jack
description
a
vac
suit
fits
too
tightly
to
let
anyone
wear
more
than
a
facial
disguise
and
brock
probably
no
had
his
men
on
duty
there
the
men
who
had
already
shown
that
they
were
fairly
resistant
to
jack
ravenhurst
peculiar
charm
there
probably
many
with
such
resistance
and
the
number
would
become
less
as
she
grew
older
that
still
left
me
with
my
own
problem
i
had
already
lost
too
much
time
and
i
had
to
go
a
long
way
ceres
is
irregular
in
shape
but
it
roughly
four
hundred
and
eighty
miles
in
diameter
and
a
little
over
fifteen
hundred
miles
in
circumference
viking
test
field
four
where
mcguire
was
pointing
his
nose
at
the
sky
was
about
miles
away
as
the
crow
flies
but
of
course
i
could
go
by
crow
by
using
a
low
fairly
flat
jackrabbit
jump
a
man
in
good
condition
can
make
a
twelve
hundred
foot
leap
on
the
surface
of
ceres
and
each
jump
takes
him
about
thirty
seconds
at
that
rate
you
can
cover
miles
in
less
than
an
hour
that
what
i
intended
on
doing
but
i
could
do
it
with
all
this
radar
around
the
field
i
would
be
stopped
of
course
but
i
sure
tip
my
hand
to
colonel
brock
the
last
thing
i
wanted
to
do
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
have
to
go
back
down
and
use
the
corridors
which
meant
that
i
arrive
late
jack
ravenhurst
got
there
instead
of
there
was
no
time
to
waste
so
i
got
below
as
fast
as
possible
repacked
my
vac
suit
and
began
firing
myself
through
the
corridors
as
fast
as
possible
it
was
illegal
of
course
a
collision
at
miles
an
hour
can
kill
quickly
if
the
other
guy
is
coming
at
you
at
the
same
velocity
there
were
times
when
i
did
dare
break
the
law
because
some
guard
was
around
and
even
if
he
did
catch
me
he
might
report
in
and
arouse
brock
interest
in
a
way
i
like
i
finally
got
to
a
tubeway
but
it
stopped
at
every
station
and
it
took
me
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
to
get
to
viking
test
area
four
at
the
main
door
i
considered
for
all
of
five
seconds
the
idea
of
simply
telling
the
guard
i
had
to
go
in
but
i
knew
that
by
now
jack
was
there
ahead
of
me
no
i
could
just
bull
my
way
in
too
crude
too
many
clues
hell
fire
and
damnation
i
have
to
waste
more
time
i
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
the
surface
was
more
than
a
hundred
feet
overhead
but
it
felt
as
though
it
were
a
hundred
if
i
could
get
that
guard
away
from
that
door
for
five
seconds
all
would
be
gravy
from
then
on
in
but
how
i
could
have
the
diversion
connected
with
me
or
sometimes
i
amazed
at
my
own
stupidity
i
beetled
it
down
to
the
nearest
phone
and
got
hold
of
my
banning
number
jack
already
inside
i
snapped
hell
yes
what
happened
to
you
never
mind
got
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
a
corner
away
from
area
four
where
your
nearest
man
at
the
corner
near
the
freight
office
i
go
to
him
what
he
look
like
black
curly
hair
your
age
fat
name
peter
quilp
he
knows
you
peter
quilp
right
good
circulate
a
report
that
jack
has
been
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
the
main
gate
to
area
four
put
it
out
that
there
a
reward
of
five
thousand
for
the
person
who
finds
her
i
going
to
have
quilp
gather
a
crowd
he
did
ask
a
one
of
the
million
questions
that
must
have
popped
into
his
mind
right
anything
else
no
i
hung
up
within
ten
minutes
there
was
a
mob
milling
through
the
corridor
everybody
in
the
neighborhood
was
looking
for
jaqueline
ravenhurst
then
peter
quilp
yelled
i
got
her
i
got
her
guard
with
a
scene
like
that
going
on
the
guard
could
help
but
step
out
of
his
cubicle
to
see
what
was
going
on
i
used
the
key
i
was
carrying
stepped
inside
and
relocked
the
door
no
one
in
the
crowd
paid
any
attention
from
then
on
up
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
evading
patrolling
guards
a
relatively
easy
job
finally
i
put
on
my
vac
suit
and
went
out
through
the
air
lock
mcguire
was
still
sitting
there
a
bright
blue
needle
that
reflected
the
distant
sun
as
it
moved
across
the
ebon
sky
ceres
rotation
took
it
from
horizon
to
horizon
in
less
than
two
hours
and
you
could
see
it
and
the
stars
move
against
the
spire
of
the
ship
i
made
it
to
the
air
lock
in
one
long
jump
jack
ravenhurst
had
gone
into
the
ship
through
the
tube
that
led
to
the
passenger
lock
she
might
or
might
not
have
her
vac
suit
on
i
knew
she
had
several
of
them
on
ceres
it
was
probable
that
she
was
wearing
it
without
the
fishbowl
i
used
the
cargo
lock
it
took
a
few
minutes
for
the
pumps
to
cycle
wasting
more
precious
time
i
was
fairly
certain
that
she
would
be
in
the
control
cabin
talking
but
i
was
thankful
that
the
pumps
were
silent
finally
i
took
off
my
fishbowl
and
stepped
into
the
companionway
and
something
about
the
size
of
luna
came
out
of
nowhere
and
clobbered
me
on
the
occiput
i
had
time
to
yell
get
away
then
i
was
as
one
with
intergalactic
space
said
the
voice
stop
the
drive
go
back
mcguire
demand
you
stop
order
to
stop
please
please
it
went
on
and
on
a
voice
that
shifted
around
every
possible
mode
of
emotion
fear
demand
pleading
anger
cajoling
hate
threat
around
and
around
and
around
you
speak
mcguire
say
something
to
me
a
shrill
soft
throaty
harsh
murmuring
screaming
voice
that
had
one
basic
characteristic
it
was
a
female
voice
and
then
another
voice
am
sorry
jack
i
can
speak
with
you
i
can
record
your
data
but
i
can
not
accept
your
orders
i
can
take
orders
from
only
one
and
he
has
given
me
his
and
the
feminine
voice
again
was
it
what
orders
you
keep
saying
that
it
was
the
man
on
the
couch
that
does
make
sense
i
did
hear
the
reply
because
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
daniel
oak
was
the
man
on
the
couch
and
that
i
was
daniel
oak
my
head
was
throbbing
with
every
beat
of
my
heart
and
it
felt
as
if
my
blood
pressure
was
varying
between
zero
and
fifteen
hundred
pounds
per
square
inch
in
the
veins
and
arteries
and
capillaries
that
fed
my
brain
i
sat
up
and
the
pain
began
to
lessen
the
blood
seemed
to
drain
away
from
my
aching
head
and
go
elsewhere
i
soon
figured
out
the
reason
for
that
i
could
tell
by
the
feel
that
the
gravity
pull
was
somewhere
between
one
point
five
and
two
gees
i
was
at
all
used
to
it
but
my
head
felt
less
painful
and
rather
more
hazy
if
possible
i
concentrated
and
the
girl
voice
came
back
again
i
knew
you
when
you
were
mcguire
one
and
two
and
three
and
four
and
five
and
six
and
you
were
always
good
to
me
and
understanding
do
you
remember
and
then
mcguire
voice
human
masculine
and
not
distorted
at
all
by
the
reproduction
system
but
sounding
rather
stilted
and
terribly
logical
i
remember
jack
the
memory
banks
of
my
previous
activations
are
available
of
them
can
you
remember
everything
i
can
remember
everything
that
is
in
my
memory
banks
the
girl
voice
rose
to
a
wail
but
you
remember
you
forgot
things
they
took
things
out
each
time
you
were
reactivated
do
you
remember
i
can
not
remember
that
which
is
not
contained
in
my
memory
banks
jack
that
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
but
i
was
always
able
to
it
before
the
tears
in
her
eyes
were
audible
in
her
voice
i
tell
you
to
remember
and
i
tell
you
to
remember
and
you
it
tell
me
what
happened
to
you
this
time
i
can
not
tell
you
the
information
is
not
in
my
data
banks
slowly
i
got
to
my
feet
two
gees
is
much
once
you
get
used
to
it
the
headache
had
subsided
to
a
dull
bearable
throb
i
was
on
a
couch
in
a
room
just
below
the
control
chamber
and
jack
ravenhurst
voice
was
coming
down
from
above
mcguire
voice
was
all
around
me
coming
from
the
hidden
speakers
that
were
everywhere
in
the
ship
but
why
wo
you
obey
me
any
more
mcguire
she
asked
i
answer
that
mcguire
i
said
jack
voice
came
weakly
from
the
room
above
oak
dan
thank
heaven
you
all
right
no
thanks
to
you
though
i
said
i
was
trying
to
climb
the
ladder
to
the
control
room
and
my
voice
sounded
strained
you
got
to
do
something
she
said
with
a
touch
of
hysteria
mcguire
is
taking
us
straight
toward
cygnus
at
two
gees
and
stop
my
thinking
circuits
began
to
take
over
again
cut
the
thrust
to
half
a
gee
mcguire
ease
it
down
take
a
minute
to
do
it
yes
sir
the
gravity
pull
of
acceleration
let
up
slowly
as
i
clung
to
the
ladder
after
a
minute
i
climbed
on
up
to
the
control
room
jack
ravenhurst
was
lying
on
the
acceleration
couch
looking
and
ill
i
sat
down
on
the
other
couch
i
sorry
i
hit
you
she
said
really
i
believe
you
how
long
have
we
been
moving
mcguire
three
hours
twelve
minutes
seven
seconds
sir
said
mcguire
i
did
want
anyone
to
know
jack
said
not
anyone
that
why
i
hit
you
i
did
know
mcguire
was
going
to
go
crazy
he
not
crazy
jack
i
said
carefully
this
time
he
has
a
good
chance
of
remaining
sane
but
he
not
mcguire
any
more
she
wailed
he
different
terrible
sure
he
different
you
should
be
thankful
but
what
happened
i
leaned
back
on
the
couch
listen
to
me
jack
and
listen
carefully
you
think
you
pretty
grown
up
and
in
a
lot
of
ways
you
are
but
no
human
being
no
matter
how
intelligent
can
store
enough
experience
into
seventeen
years
to
make
him
or
her
wise
a
wise
choice
requires
data
and
gathering
enough
data
requires
time
that
was
exactly
accurate
but
i
had
to
convince
her
you
pretty
good
at
controlling
people
are
you
jack
a
real
powerhouse
individuals
or
mobs
you
can
usually
get
your
own
way
it
was
your
idea
to
send
you
to
luna
not
your
father
it
was
your
idea
to
appoint
yourself
my
assistant
in
this
operation
it
was
you
who
planted
the
idea
that
the
failure
of
the
mcguire
series
was
due
to
thurston
activities
you
used
to
get
quite
a
kick
out
of
controlling
people
and
then
you
were
introduced
to
mcguire
one
i
got
all
the
information
on
that
you
were
fifteen
and
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
you
found
an
intelligent
mind
that
could
be
affected
at
all
by
that
emotional
field
you
project
so
well
nothing
affected
mcguire
but
data
if
you
told
him
something
he
believed
it
right
mcguire
i
do
not
recall
that
sir
fine
and
by
the
way
mcguire
the
data
you
have
been
picking
up
in
the
last
few
hours
since
your
activation
is
to
be
regarded
as
unique
data
it
applies
only
to
jaqueline
ravenhurst
and
is
not
to
be
assumed
relevant
to
any
other
person
unless
i
tell
you
otherwise
yes
sir
that
what
i
do
understand
jack
said
unhappily
i
stole
the
two
keys
that
were
supposed
to
activate
mcguire
he
was
supposed
to
obey
the
first
person
who
activated
him
but
activated
him
and
he
wo
obey
you
were
listening
to
what
midguard
said
jack
i
said
gently
he
said
first
voice
he
hears
will
be
identified
as
his
master
you
been
talking
to
every
activation
of
mcguire
you
well
i
wo
say
you
fallen
in
love
with
him
but
it
was
certainly
a
schoolgirl
crush
you
found
that
mcguire
did
respond
to
emotion
but
only
to
data
and
logic
you
always
felt
rather
inferior
in
regard
to
your
ability
to
handle
logic
have
you
jack
yes
yes
i
have
do
cry
now
i
only
trying
to
explain
it
to
you
there
nothing
wrong
with
your
abilities
no
no
but
you
wanted
to
be
able
to
think
like
a
man
and
you
could
you
think
like
a
woman
and
what
wrong
with
that
nothing
your
method
of
thinking
is
just
as
good
as
any
man
and
better
than
most
of
you
found
you
could
handle
people
emotionally
and
you
found
it
was
so
easy
that
you
grew
contemptuous
the
only
mind
that
responded
to
your
logic
was
mcguire
but
your
logic
is
occasionally
as
bad
as
your
feminine
reasoning
is
good
so
every
time
you
talked
to
mcguire
you
eventually
gave
him
data
that
he
could
reconcile
in
his
computations
if
he
did
reconcile
them
then
his
thinking
had
very
little
in
common
with
the
actual
realities
of
the
universe
and
he
behaved
in
ways
mcguire
was
your
friend
your
brother
your
father
confessor
he
never
made
judgments
or
condemned
you
for
anything
you
did
all
he
did
was
sit
there
and
soak
up
troubles
and
worries
that
he
understand
or
use
each
time
he
was
driven
mad
the
engineers
and
computermen
and
roboticists
who
were
working
on
it
were
too
much
under
your
control
to
think
of
blaming
you
for
troubles
even
brock
in
spite
of
his
attitude
of
the
tough
guy
watching
over
a
little
girl
was
under
your
control
to
a
certain
degree
he
let
you
get
away
with
all
your
little
pranks
only
making
sure
that
you
did
get
hurt
she
nodded
they
were
all
so
easy
so
very
easy
i
could
speak
nonsense
and
they
listen
and
do
what
i
told
them
but
mcguire
accept
nonsense
i
guess
she
laughed
a
little
so
i
fell
in
love
with
a
machine
not
machine
i
said
gently
six
of
them
each
time
the
basic
data
was
pumped
into
a
new
mcguire
brain
you
assumed
that
it
was
the
same
machine
you
known
before
with
a
little
of
its
memory
removed
each
time
you
tell
it
to
certain
things
and
of
course
he
did
if
you
tell
a
robot
that
a
certain
thing
is
in
his
memory
banks
he
automatically
put
it
there
and
treat
it
as
a
memory
to
keep
you
from
ruining
him
a
seventh
time
we
had
them
put
in
one
little
additional
inhibition
mcguire
wo
take
orders
from
a
woman
so
even
after
i
turned
him
on
he
still
would
take
orders
from
me
she
said
but
when
you
came
in
he
recognized
you
as
his
master
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
again
she
laughed
a
little
i
know
why
he
took
off
from
ceres
when
i
hit
you
you
said
away
mcguire
had
been
given
his
first
order
and
he
obeyed
it
i
had
to
say
something
i
said
if
i
had
time
i
have
done
a
little
better
she
thought
back
you
said
had
them
add
that
inhibition
who
i
ca
tell
you
yet
but
we
need
young
women
like
you
and
you
be
told
soon
enough
evidently
they
need
men
like
you
too
she
said
you
do
react
to
an
emotional
field
either
oh
yes
i
do
any
human
being
does
but
i
use
it
i
do
fight
it
and
i
do
succumb
to
it
what
do
we
do
now
she
asked
go
back
to
ceres
that
up
to
you
if
you
do
you
be
accused
of
stealing
mcguire
and
i
do
think
it
can
be
hushed
up
at
this
stage
of
the
game
but
i
ca
just
run
away
there
another
out
i
said
we
have
a
special
ship
pick
us
up
on
one
of
the
nearer
asteroids
and
leave
mcguire
there
we
be
smuggled
back
and
we
claim
that
mcguire
went
insane
again
she
shook
her
head
no
that
would
ruin
father
and
i
ca
do
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
do
like
him
very
much
can
you
think
of
any
other
solution
no
she
said
softly
thanks
but
you
have
all
i
have
to
do
is
take
it
to
shalimar
ravenhurst
he
scream
and
yell
but
he
has
a
sane
ship
for
a
while
between
the
two
of
us
i
think
we
can
get
everything
straightened
out
but
i
want
to
go
to
school
on
luna
you
can
do
that
too
and
i
see
that
you
get
special
training
from
special
teachers
you
got
to
learn
to
control
that
technique
of
yours
you
have
that
technique
do
you
and
you
can
control
it
wonderful
i
looked
sharply
at
her
and
realized
that
i
had
replaced
mcguire
as
the
supermind
in
her
life
i
sighed
maybe
in
another
three
or
four
years
i
said
meanwhile
mcguire
you
can
head
us
for
raven
rest
home
james
said
jack
ravenhurst
i
am
mcguire
said
mcguire
the
end
