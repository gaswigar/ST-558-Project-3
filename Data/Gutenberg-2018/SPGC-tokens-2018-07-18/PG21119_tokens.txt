this
book
is
a
little
different
from
most
of
the
others
from
this
author
the
cast
of
the
story
are
just
a
shade
older
than
we
are
used
to
in
vaizey
books
and
there
is
no
one
who
is
afflicted
with
a
disabling
disease
such
as
the
author
herself
suffered
from
i
suppose
you
could
describe
the
setting
as
the
mayfair
set
the
scene
opens
in
the
house
of
a
tidy
old
spinster
living
in
a
tidy
little
seaside
town
in
a
row
of
large
houses
of
similar
people
sharing
private
access
to
a
garden
a
rather
stable
existence
there
is
also
a
nice
young
american
girl
over
in
england
as
part
of
her
education
no
doubt
her
father
has
become
very
rich
in
america
but
he
is
the
brother
of
the
tidy
old
spinster
on
whom
and
to
whose
dismay
he
has
imposed
cornelia
visit
cornelia
is
simply
not
used
to
the
standards
of
english
behaviour
for
instance
chaperones
and
not
gadding
about
with
young
men
cornelia
has
quite
enough
to
do
as
she
pleases
but
her
aunt
is
proved
right
in
the
end
for
among
all
these
nice
people
there
is
a
baddy
which
is
revealed
only
towards
the
end

chapter
one
somewhere
on
the
west
coast
of
england
about
a
hundred
miles
from
the
metropolis
there
stands
a
sleepy
little
town
which
possesses
no
special
activity
nor
beauty
to
justify
its
existence
people
live
in
it
for
reasons
of
their
own
the
people
who
do
live
in
it
wonder
for
reasons
but
attain
no
better
solution
of
the
mystery
than
the
statement
that
the
air
is
very
fine
we
have
such
bracing
air
says
the
resident
as
proudly
as
if
that
said
air
were
his
special
invention
and
property
certain
doctors
affect
for
patients
in
need
of
restful
change
and
their
melancholy
advent
justifies
the
existence
of
the
great
hotel
on
the
esplanade
and
the
row
of
at
the
corner
there
are
ten
in
all
and
on
sunny
days
ten
old
ladies
can
generally
be
seen
sitting
inside
their
canopies
trundling
slowly
along
the
esplanade
accompanied
by
a
paid
companion
dressed
in
black
and
looking
sorry
for
herself
occasionally
on
saturdays
and
sundays
a
pretty
daughter
or
a
tall
son
takes
the
companion
place
but
as
sure
as
monday
arrives
they
disappear
into
space
one
can
imagine
that
one
hears
them
bidding
their
farewells
so
glad
to
see
you
getting
on
so
well
mother
dear
i
positively
rush
back
to
town
to
attend
to
a
hundred
duties
a
comfort
to
feel
that
you
are
so
well
placed
miss
biggs
is
a
treasure
and
this
air
is
so
bracing
the
esplanade
consists
of
four
rows
of
and
two
hotels
in
front
of
which
is
a
strip
of
grass
on
which
a
band
plays
twice
a
week
during
the
summer
months
and
the
twice
a
day
all
the
year
long
the
invalids
in
the
hotel
object
to
the
children
and
make
unsuccessful
attempts
to
banish
them
from
their
pitch
and
the
children
in
their
turn
regard
the
invalids
with
frank
disdain
and
make
audible
and
uncomplimentary
surmises
as
to
the
nature
of
their
complaints
as
the
procession
of
chairs
trundles
by
in
front
of
the
green
and
separating
it
from
the
steep
pebbly
shore
are
a
number
of
fishermen
shanties
bathing
machines
and
hulks
of
old
vessels
stretched
in
a
long
straggling
row
while
one
larger
shed
stands
back
from
the
rest
labelled
lifeboat
in
large
white
letters
parallel
with
the
esplanade
runs
the
high
street
a
narrow
thoroughfare
showing
shops
crowded
with
the
useless
little
articles
which
are
supposed
to
prove
irresistibly
attractive
to
visitors
to
the
seaside
at
the
bazaar
a
big
white
label
proclaims
that
everything
in
the
window
is
to
be
sold
at
the
astounding
price
of
and
the
purchaser
is
free
to
make
his
choice
from
such
treasures
as
lined
in
crimson
plush
and
covered
with
a
massed
pattern
in
shells
desks
fitted
with
all
the
implements
for
writing
scent
bottles
tied
with
blue
ribbons
packets
of
stationery
with
local
views
photograph
frames
in
plush
and
gelatine
or
to
select
more
perishable
trophies
in
glass
and
china
all
solemnly
guaranteed
to
be
worth
double
the
price
at
the
photographer
a
few
yards
farther
along
a
visitor
can
have
his
portrait
taken
a
yard
square
the
size
of
a
postage
stamp
or
on
a
postcard
to
send
to
his
friends
ingenious
backgrounds
are
on
hand
representing
appropriate
seaside
scenes
in
which
the
sitter
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
press
his
face
against
a
hole
on
the
canvas
and
these
are
extensively
patronised
for
what
can
be
more
convenient
than
to
stand
on
solid
earth
attired
in
sober
everyday
clothing
yet
be
portrayed
splashing
in
the
waves
in
the
spandiest
of
french
bathing
costumes
riding
a
donkey
along
the
sands
or
manfully
hauling
down
the
sails
of
a
yacht
mr
photographer
sykes
is
a
man
of
resource
and
deserves
the
prosperity
which
is
the
envy
of
his
neighbours
mrs
sykes
wears
silk
linings
to
her
skirts
on
sundays
and
rustles
like
the
highest
in
the
land
she
had
three
new
hats
in
one
summer
and
the
fishmonger
wife
knows
for
a
fact
that
not
one
of
the
number
costs
less
than
the
high
street
and
the
esplanade
constitute
the
new
which
has
sprung
into
being
within
the
last
ten
years
but
the
real
original
aristocratic
norton
lies
a
couple
of
miles
inland
and
consists
of
a
wide
sloping
street
lined
with
alternate
shops
and
houses
branching
off
from
which
are
a
number
of
sleepy
roads
in
which
detached
and
detached
villas
hide
themselves
behind
trees
and
hedges
and
barricade
their
windows
with
stiff
white
curtains
the
one
great
longing
actuating
the
norton
householder
seems
to
be
to
see
nothing
and
to
be
seen
by
none
is
the
house
overlooked
they
ask
the
agent
anxiously
on
the
occasion
of
the
first
application
does
it
overlook
any
other
house
there
another
house
across
the
road
madam
the
agent
is
sometimes
regretfully
obliged
to
admit
but
it
has
been
very
cleverly
planted
out
so
it
has
by
means
of
a
fir
or
an
elm
planted
within
a
few
yards
of
the
windows
and
blocking
out
something
more
important
than
another
villa
but
the
norton
resident
desires
privacy
above
all
things
the
sun
and
the
air
have
to
creep
in
as
best
they
may
the
more
aristocratic
the
position
of
a
family
the
more
secluded
becomes
their
position
fences
are
raised
by
an
arrangement
of
work
on
the
top
of
boards
shrubs
are
planted
thickly
inside
the
hedges
even
the
railings
of
the
gates
are
backed
by
discreetly
concealing
boards
if
there
happens
to
be
a
rise
in
the
road
from
which
a
by
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
white
figures
darting
to
and
fro
on
the
tennis
courts
the
owner
promptly
throws
up
a
bank
and
plants
on
the
top
one
or
two
quickly
growing
limes
it
is
so
disagreeable
to
be
overlooked
at
the
date
at
which
this
history
opens
there
were
several
large
places
in
the
neighbourhood
of
norton
foremost
among
them
were
the
manor
house
occupied
by
the
young
squire
geoffrey
greville
and
madame
his
mother
green
arbour
owned
by
admiral
perry
who
had
married
the
widow
of
the
late
high
sheriff
and
the
meads
the
ofttime
deserted
seat
of
a
rich
london
banker
with
these
exceptions
quite
the
most
aristocratic
dwellings
were
situated
in
what
was
known
as
the
park
though
perhaps
the
crescent
would
have
been
the
more
appropriate
name
for
the
twelve
houses
were
built
on
one
side
of
a
curving
road
looking
out
on
a
charming
stretch
of
land
dipping
down
to
a
miniature
lake
and
rising
again
to
a
soft
green
knoll
surmounted
by
a
bank
of
trees
the
grass
looked
like
softest
velvet
and
might
be
seen
but
not
touched
being
surrounded
by
tiny
wire
arches
and
protected
by
wooden
boards
requesting
visitors
to
keep
to
the
paths
and
not
trespass
on
the
verges
impressive
title
visitors
were
likewise
requested
not
to
touch
the
flowering
shrubs
not
to
pick
the
flowers
not
to
throw
rubbish
into
the
lake
or
to
inscribe
their
initials
on
the
seats
these
rules
being
carefully
observed
the
twelve
householders
who
paid
for
the
upkeep
of
these
decorous
gardens
were
free
to
enjoy
such
relaxations
as
could
be
derived
from
gravel
paths
and
wooden
benches
the
view
from
their
windows
the
residents
apparently
did
not
wish
to
enjoy
for
they
planted
their
trees
and
heightened
their
fences
as
industriously
as
the
owners
of
the
villas
in
hill
street
mrs
garnett
at
buona
vista
having
a
garden
deficient
in
foliage
had
even
erected
a
temporary
trellis
at
the
end
of
the
lawn
and
covered
it
with
creepers
rather
than
face
the
indignity
of
an
open
view
it
gave
her
such
a
feeling
of
publicity
to
see
the
neighbours
pass
to
and
fro
it
was
only
the
residents
themselves
who
enjoyed
the
proud
privilege
of
pacing
the
park
unmolested
for
at
either
entrance
stood
small
eaved
lodges
in
which
were
housed
the
two
gardeners
and
their
wives
to
be
to
the
park
was
as
great
a
guarantee
of
respectability
in
norton
as
to
be
vicar
of
the
parish
church
itself
only
married
teetotal
childless
churchmen
could
apply
for
the
posts
and
among
their
scant
ranks
the
most
searching
inquiries
were
instituted
before
an
appointment
was
finally
arranged
it
is
safe
to
affirm
that
no
working
couples
on
earth
were
more
clean
industrious
and
alive
to
their
duty
towards
their
betters
than
the
occupants
of
the
north
and
south
lodges
of
norton
park
all
day
long
the
two
husbands
mowed
grass
clipped
hedges
and
swept
up
gravel
paths
all
day
long
the
wives
scrubbed
and
dusted
their
immaculate
little
houses
keeping
a
on
the
door
to
see
who
passed
to
and
fro
their
duty
it
was
to
pounce
out
on
any
stranger
who
dared
attempt
to
force
an
entrance
through
the
hallowed
portals
and
send
them
back
discomfited
you
ca
come
this
way
madam
this
road
is
private
ca
i
just
walk
straight
through
on

path
it
is
so
much
nearer
than
going

the
way
round

park

private
madam
there
is
no
thoroughfare
occasionally
some
child
of
sin
would
endeavour
to
prevaricate

wish
to
pay
a
call
which
house
did
you
wish
to
go

is
away
from
home
they
wo
be
back
till
the
end
of
the
month
foiled
in
her
attempts
the
miscreant
would
have
to
retrace
her
steps
or
make
her
way
round
by
the
narrow
lane
by
means
of
which
the
tradesmen
made
their
way
to
the
of
these
secluded
dwellings
perhaps
the
most
unpromisingly
decorous
house
in
the
park
was
christened
the
nook
with
that
appalling
lack
of
humour
which
is
nowhere
portrayed
more
strikingly
than
in
the
naming
of
suburban
residences
it
stood
fair
and
square
in
the
middle
of
the
crescent
and
from
garret
to
cellar
there
was
not
a
nooky
corner
on
which
the
eye
could
light
two
windows
flanked
the
front
door
on
the
left
two
windows
on
the
right
there
was
not
even
a
gable
or
a
dormer
to
break
the
square
solidity
of
the
whole
fourteen
windows
in
all
each
chastely
shrouded
in
nottingham
lace
curtains
looped
back
by
yellow
silk
bands
fastened
to
a
fraction
of
an
inch
at
the
same
height
from
the
sill
while
aspidistra
plants
mounted
on
small
tables
were
artfully
placed
so
as
to
fill
up
the
space
necessarily
left
in
the
centre
they
were
handsome
plants
of
venerable
age
which
mason
the
parlourmaid
watered
twice
a
week
sponging
their
leaves
with
milk
before
she
replaced
them
in
their
pots
it
was
a
typical
early
victorian
residence
inhabited
by
a
spinster
lady
of
early
victorian
type
and
her
four
henchwomen

the
cook

the
housemaid

parlourmaid
and

the
tweeny

women
plus
a

upon

solitary
person

in
conclave
with
the
domestic
at
the
croft
to
the
right
and
the
holt
to
the
left
miss
briskett
maids
were
wont
to
assert
that
they
were
worked
off
their
feet
it
was
as
has
been
said
an
early
victorian
household
conducted
on
early
victorian
lines
other
people
might
be
content
to
buy
half
their
supplies
from
the
stores
but
miss
briskett
insisted
on
bread
jams
and
cakes
made
pickles
and
sauces
tongues
and
hams
and
liqueurs
cook
kept
the
tweeny
busy
in
the
kitchen
while
mary
grumbled
at
having
to
keep
half
a
dozen
unused
bedrooms
in
spick
and
span
perfection
and
mason
spent
her
existence
in
polishing
and
sweeping
invisible
grains
of
dust
from
as
a
rule
the
domestic
wheel
turned
on
oiled
wheels
and
miss
existence
flowed
on
its
even
course
from
one
year
end
to
another
with
little
but
the
weather
to
differentiate
one
month
from
another
but
on
the
day
on
which
this
history
begins
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
bearing
a
new
york
which
the
postman
handed
in
at
the
door
of
the
nook
at
the
three
delivery
miss
briskett
read
its
contents
and
gasped
read
them
again
and
trembled
read
them
a
third
time
and
sat
buried
in
thought
for
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
she
opened
her
own
desk
and
penned
a
note
to
her
friend
and
confidant
mrs
ramsden
of
the
holt
my
dear
friend
i
have
just
received
a
communication
from
america
which
is
causing
me
considerable
perturbation
if
your
engagements
will
allow
i
should
be
grateful
if
you
will
take
tea
with
me
this
afternoon
and
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
wise
counsel
pray
send
a
verbal
answer
by
yours
sincerely
sophia
a
briskett
the
trim
mason
took
the
note
to
its
destination
and
waited
in
the
hall
while
mrs
ramsden
wrote
her
reply
the
reference
to
a
verbal
answer
was
only
a
matter
of
form
miss
briskett
would
have
been
surprised
and
affronted
to
receive
so
unceremonious
a
reply
to
her
invitation
my
dear
friend
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
take
tea
with
you
this
afternoon
as
you
so
kindly
suggest
i
trust
that
the
anxiety
under
which
you
are
labouring
may
be
of
a
temporary
nature
and
shall
be
thankful
indeed
if
i
can
in
any
way
assist
to
bring
about
its
most
truly
yours
ellen

ramsden
the
best
china
mason
and
a
teapot
for
two
was
miss
briskett
order
on
receipt
of
this
cordial
response
and
an
hour
later
the
two
ladies
sat
in
conclave
over
a
table
in
the
of
the
nook
miss
briskett
was
a
tall
thin
woman
of
or
sixty
wearing
a
white
cap
perched
upon
her
grey
hair
and
an
expression
of
frosty
propriety
on
her
thin
pointed
features
frosty
is
the
adjective
which
most
accurately
describes
her
appearance
one
felt
a
moral
conviction
that
she
would
suffer
from
chilblains
in
winter
that
the
long
thin
fingers
must
be
cold
to
the
touch
even
on
this
bright
may
day
that
the
tip
of
her
nose
was
colder
still
that
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
at
night
without
a
hot
bottle
to
her
feet
she
was
addicted
to
grey
dresses
composed
of
stiff
and
shiny
silk
and
to
grey
bonnets
glittering
with
steely
beads
she
creaked
as
she
moved
and
her
thin
figure
was
into
an
unnatural
rigidity
mrs
ramsden
was
in
appearance
at
least
a
striking
contrast
to
her
friend
being
a
dumpy
little
woman
in
whose
demeanour
vied
with
dignity
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
affected
an
upright
feather
in
front
of
her
bonnets
to
give
me
height
my
dear
in
looking
at
her
one
was
irresistibly
reminded
of
a
pouter
pigeon
strutting
along
on
its
short
little
legs
preening
its
sleek
little
head
to
and
fro
above
its
protuberant
breast
read
that
said
miss
briskett
tragically
handing
the
thin
sheet
of
paper
to
her
friend
and
mrs
ramsden
put
on
her
spectacles
and
read
as
follows
my
dear
sister
business
connected
with
mines
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
go
out
west
for
the
next
few
months
and
the
question
has
arisen
how
to
provide
for
cornelia
meantime
i
had
various
notions
but
she
prefers
her
own
she
generally
does
and
reckons
she
ca
fill
in
this
gap
better
than
by
running
over
to
pay
you
a
visit
in
the
old
country
i
can
pick
her
up
in
the
fall
and
have
a
little
trot
round
before
returning
she
has
friends
sailing
in
the
on
the
and
intends
crossing
with
them
you
will
just
have
time
to
cable
to
put
her
off
if
you
are
dead
or
otherwise
incapacitated
but
i
take
it
you
will
be
glad
to
have
a
look
at
my
girl
she
worth
looking
at
i
shall
feel
satisfied
to
know
she
is
with
you
she
might
get
up
to
mischief
over
here
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
later
on
your
brother
edward
briskett
dear
aunt
soph
do
you
worry
to
prepare
i
just
chip
in
and
take
you
as
you
are
we
have
some
high
old
times
your
niece
cornelia
letter
and
fell
together
upon
mrs
ramsden
knee
she
raised
startled
eyes
and
blinked
dumbly
at
her
friend
miss
briskett
wagged
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
heaved
a
sepulchral
sigh
the
halcyon
days
of
peace
were
over
chapter
two
my
dear
said
mrs
ramsden
solemnly
this
is
indeed
great
news
i
do
wonder
that
you
feel
unnerved
i
do
indeed
the
three
post
came
in
and
i
was
quite
surprised
when
mary
came
in
with
the
salver
i
was
not
expecting
any
letters
i
have
so
few
correspondents
and
i
am
mostly
in
their
debt
i
am
afraid
still
of
course
there
are
always
the
circulars
i
looked
for
nothing
more
exciting
and
then
arrived
i
really
felt
that
i
could
not
sit
alone
and
think
it
out
by
myself
all
day
long
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
asking
you
to
come
over
on
such
short
notice
indeed
i
am
flattered
that
you
should
wish
to
have
me
do
tell
me
all
about
this
brother
he
has
lived
abroad
a
long
time
i
think
it
is
the
eldest
is
it
not
the
rich
one
in
america
i
believe
he
is
rich
for
the
moment
goodness
knows
how
long
it
may
last
sighed
miss
briskett
dolefully
he
speculates
in
mines
my
dear
and
you
know
what
means
half
the
time
he
is
a
pauper
and
the
other
half
a
millionaire
and
so
far
as
i
can
gather
from
his
letters
he
seems
just
as
well
satisfied
one
way
as
another
he
was
always
a
flighty
irresponsible
creature
and
i
fear
cornelia
has
taken
after
him
she
is
the
only
child
yes
she
had
an
english
mother
i
thankful
to
say
but
poor
sybil
died
at
her
birth
and
edward
never
married
again
he
was
devoted
to
sybil
and
said
he
would
never
give
another
woman
the
charge
of
her
child
such
nonsense
as
if
any
man
on
earth
could
look
after
a
growing
girl
without
a
woman
help
instead
of
a
wise
judicious
stepmother
she
has
been
left
to
nurses
and
governesses
and
from
what
i
can
hear
has
ruled
instead
of
the
other
way
about
you
can
see
by
the
tone
of
her
father
letter
that
he
is
absurdly
prejudiced
that
is
natural
perhaps
with
an
only
child
left
to
him
in
such
peculiarly
sad
circumstances
we
must
not
judge
him
hardly
for
that
said
little
mrs
ramsden
kindly
has
the
girl
herself
ever
written
to
you
before
may
i
ask
or
is
this
her
first
communication
miss
briskett
back
stiffened
and
her
thin
lips
set
in
a
straight
line
she
has
addressed
little
notes
to
me
from
time
to
time
on
birthdays
and
christmases
and
so
on
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
i
have
not
encouraged
their
continuance
they
were
unduly
familiar
and
i
object
to
being
addressed
by
abbreviations
of
my
name
ideas
as
to
what
is
right
and
fitting
seem
to
differ
on
different
sides
of
the
atlantic
they
do
indeed
i
have
always
understood
that
young
people
are
brought
into
quite
undue
prominence
in
american
households
and
their
manners
too
one
sees
in
that
postscript
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
just
between
ourselves
a
a
quite
so
i
feel
it
myself
i
am
most
grieved
about
it
cornelia
is
my
niece
and
edward
is
the
head
of
the
family
her
position
as
his
only
child
is
one
of
importance
and
i
feel
distressed
that
she
is
so
little
qualified
to
adorn
it
she
has
been
well
educated
i
believe
has
as
they
call
it
but
she
has
evidently
none
of
our
english
polish
quite
in
confidence
mrs
ramsden
i
feel
that
she
may
be
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
the
neighbourhood
you
think
of
receiving
her
then
your
brother
leaves
you
the
option
of
refusing
and
i
should
think
things
over
very
seriously
before
incurring
such
a
responsibility
a
visit
i
doubt
you
could
not
stand
the
strain
if
you
excused
yourself
on
the
ground
of
health
no
offence
could
possibly
be
taken
but
at
that
miss
briskett
protested
strongly
oh
my
dear
i
could
not
refuse
edward
wishes
to
find
a
home
for
the
girl
and
says
he
would
be
relieved
to
have
her
with
me
i
could
not
possibly
refuse
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
have
never
yet
shirked
a
duty
distasteful
though
it
might
be
and
i
must
not
do
so
now
i
shall
cable
to
say
that
i
will
be
pleased
to
receive
cornelia
when
it
suits
her
to
arrive
mrs
ramsden
crumbled
her
and
wondered
why
that
being
the
case
she
had
been
summoned
to
give
advice
but
being
a
soul
smiled
assent
and
deftly
shifted
the
conversation
to
the
consideration
of
details
well
dear
i
only
trust
you
may
be
rewarded
miss
cornelia
is
fortunate
to
have
such
a
home
waiting
to
receive
her
what
room
do
you
propose
to
dedicate
to
her
use
miss
briskett
face
clouded
and
she
drew
a
long
despairing
sigh
that
another
thing
i
am
troubled
about
i
had
the
best
spare
room
done
up
only
this
spring
the
carpet
had
faded
and
when
i
was
renewing
it
i
took
the
opportunity
to
have
in
the
painters
and
paperhangers
it
is
fresh
even
the
curtains
and
they
have
not
once
been
used
mrs
ramsden
purred
in
sympathetic
understanding
poor
dear
when
one
has
just
made
a
room
all
fresh
and
clean
it
is
trying
to
have
it
taken
into
use
but
why
give
her
that
room
at
all
dear
you
have
several
others
a
young
unmarried
girl
should
be
satisfied
with
a
room
at
the
back
or
even
on
the
third
storey
you
have
a
nice
little
guest
room
over
your
own
bedroom
have
you
not
no
miss
briskett
again
manifested
a
noble
determination
to
do
her
duty
i
should
like
edward
to
feel
when
he
comes
over
that
i
have
paid
his
daughter
all
due
honour
she
must
have
the
spare
room
and
if
she
spills
things
over
the
new
carpet
i
must
pray
for
grace
to
bear
it
she
has
been
accustomed
to
a
very
luxurious
style
of
living
for
the
last
few
years
and
i
daresay
even
my
best
room
will
not
be
as
handsome
as
her
own
apartment
in
the
present
state
of
edward
finances
she
is
i
suppose
a
very
great
heiress
little
mrs
ramsden
stared
into
her
cup
with
a
kindly
thoughtfulness
i
should
keep
that
fact
secret
if
i
were
you
she
said
earnestly
poor
lassie
it
always
a
handicap
to
a
girl
to
be
received
for
what
she
has
rather
than
what
she
is
and
there
are
two
or
three
idle
worthless
young
men
hanging
about
who
might
be
only
too
glad
to
pick
up
a
rich
wife
i
should
simply
announce
that
i
was
expecting
a
niece
from
the
united
states
of
america
to
pay
me
a
visit
of
some
duration
and
offer
no
enlightenment
as
to
her
circumstances
you
will
have
enough
responsibility
as
it
is
without
embarrassing
entanglements
yes
indeed
thank
you
so
much
i
feel
sure
that
your
advice
is
wise
and
i
shall
certainly
follow
it
there
that
soldier
nephew
of
mrs
mott
who
is
constantly
running
down
on
short
visits
i
object
intensely
to
that
dashing
style
he
is
just
the
type
of
man
to
run
after
a
girl
for
her
money
i
shall
take
special
care
that
they
do
not
meet
one
thing
i
am
determined
upon
said
miss
briskett
sternly
and
that
is
that
there
shall
be
no
nor
philandering
of
any
kind
under
my
roof
i
could
not
be
troubled
with
such
nonsense
nor
with
the
responsibility
of
it
i
am
accustomed
to
a
quiet
regular
life
and
if
cornelia
comes
to
me
she
must
conform
to
the
regulations
of
the
household
at
my
age
i
can
not
be
expected
to
alter
my
ways
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
certainly
not
she
is
a
mere
girl
i
suppose
how
old
may
she
be
miss
briskett
considered
she
was
born
in
the
winter
i
distinctly
remember
coming
in
and
seeing
the
cable
and
taking
off
my
fur
gloves
to
open
it
was
the
year
i
bought
the
carpet
it
was
just
down
i
remember
and
as
we
drank
the
baby
health
the
cork
flew
out
of
the
bottle
and
some
of
the
champagne
was
spilt
and
there
was
a
great
fuss
wiping
it
up
years
ago
who
would
have
thought
it
could
be
so
long
ah
it
always
pays
to
get
a
good
thing
while
you
are
about
it
it
costs
a
great
deal
at
the
start
but
you
have
such
satisfaction
afterwards
it
not
a
bit
faded
mrs
ramsden
affirmed
alluding
be
it
understood
to
the
turkey
carpet
and
not
to
miss
cornelia
briskett
just
a
year
younger
than
my
elma
elma
will
be
glad
to
have
a
companion
it
is
kind
of
you
to
say
so
nothing
would
please
me
better
than
to
see
cornelia
become
intimate
with
your
daughter
poor
child
she
has
not
had
the
advantages
of
an
english
upbringing
but
we
must
hope
that
this
visit
will
be
productive
of
much
good
she
could
not
have
a
better
example
than
elma
she
is
a
type
of
a
sweet
guileless
english
girl
asserted
the
sweet
girl
mother
doubtfully
but
you
know
dear
miss
briskett
that
at
times
even
elma
she
shook
her
head
sighed
and
continued
with
a
struggling
smile
we
must
remember
must
we
not
that
we
have
been
young
ourselves
and
try
not
to
be
too
hard
on
little
eccentricities
mrs
ramsden
spoke
with
feeling
for
memory
though
slumbering
was
not
dead
she
had
not
always
been
a
widow
lady
who
expressed
herself
with
decorum
and
wore
black
cashmere
and
bugles
thirty
odd
years
ago
she
had
been
a
plump
little
girl
with
a
lively
capacity
for
mischief
on
one
occasion
she
had
danced
of
the
programme
at
a
ball
with
an
officer
even
more
dashing
than
the
objectionable
nephew
of
mrs
mott
and
in
a
corner
of
the
conservatory
had
given
him
a
flower
from
her
bouquet
he
had
kissed
the
flower
before
pressing
it
in
his
book
and
had
looked
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
kiss
something
else
into
the
bargain
after
years
of
life
at
norton
it
was
astonishing
how
vividly
the
prim
little
widow
recalled
the
guilty
thrill
of
that
moment
on
yet
another
occasion
she
had
carried
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
with
the
brother
of
a
friend
and
had
awakened
to
tardy
pangs
of
conscience
only
when
a
more
attractive
suitor
came
upon
the
scene
mrs
ramsden
blushed
at
the
remembrance
and
felt
a
kindly
softening
of
the
heart
towards
the
absent
cornelia
but
miss
briskett
remained
coldly
unmoved
she
had
been
an
old
maid
in
her
cradle
and
had
gone
on
steadily
growing
old
maidier
ever
since
never
had
she
so
forgotten
herself
as
to
dally
with
the
affections
of
any
young
man
which
was
perhaps
the
less
to
her
credit
as
no
young
man
had
exhibited
any
inclination
to
tempt
her
from
the
paths
of
single
blessedness
she
looked
down
her
nose
at
her
friend
remark
and
replied
that
she
trusted
she
might
be
enabled
to
do
her
duty
without
either
prejudice
or
indulgence
and
soon
afterwards
mrs
ramsden
took
her
leave
and
returned
to
her
own
domain
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
of
the
holt
a
girl
was
standing
gazing
dreamily
through
the
spotted
net
curtains
with
a
weary
little
droop
in
the
lines
of
the
figure
which
bespoke
fatigue
rather
mental
than
physical
she
was
badly
dressed
in
an
skirt
and
an
blouse
and
masses
of
light
brown
hair
were
twisted
heavily
together
at
the
back
of
her
head
but
the
face
which
she
turned
to
welcome
her
mother
reminded
one
instinctively
of
a
bunch
of
flowers
of
white
narcissi
of
fragrant
pink
roses
of
pansies
deep
pansies
soft
as
velvet
given
the
right
circumstances
and
accessories
this
might
have
been
a
beauty
an
historical
beauty
whose
name
would
be
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
a
georgina
of
devonshire
a
beautiful
miss
gunning
a
witching
nell
gwynne
but
alas
beauty
is
by
no
means
independent
of
external
aid
the
poets
who
declaim
to
the
contrary
are
men
poor
things
who
know
no
better
every
woman
in
the
world
will
plump
for
a
good
dressmaker
when
she
wishes
to
appear
at
her
best
elma
ramsden
with
the
makings
of
a
beauty
was
just
a
pretty
dowdy
girl
at
whom
a
would
hardly
cast
a
second
glance
she
looked
bored
too
and
a
trifle
discontented
and
her
voice
had
a
flat
uninterested
tone
well
mother
back
again
have
you
enjoyed
your
call
thank
you
dear
it
was
hardly
a
case
of
enjoyment
i
was
invited
to
give
my
opinion
of
a
matter
of
importance
yes
i
know
should
she
have
the
sweep
this
week
or
the
week
after
next
should
she
have
new
covers
for
the
would
you
advise
or
for
the
new
dress
i
hope
you
brought
the
weight
of
your
intellect
to
bear
on
the
great
problems
and
solved
them
to
your
mutual
satisfaction
mrs
ramsden
seated
herself
on
a
and
began
pulling
off
her
tight
kid
gloves
a
touch
of
offence
was
visible
in
her
demeanour
and
the
feather
in
the
front
of
her
bonnet
reared
itself
at
an
aggressive
angle
it
is
not
in
good
taste
my
dear
to
talk
in
that
tone
to
your
mother
matters
of
domestic
interest
may
not
appeal
to
you
in
your
present
irresponsible
position
but
they
are
not
without
their
own
importance
the
subject
of
discussion
however
was
something
quite
different
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
that
miss
briskett
is
expecting
a
young
american
niece
to
pay
her
a
visit
at
an
early
date
how
young
inquired
elma
tentatively
her
mother
had
a
habit
of
alluding
to
girls
of
which
did
not
commend
itself
to
her
youthful
judgment
she
reserved
her
interest
until
assured
on
this
important
point
about
your
own
age
or
slightly
younger
the
only
daughter
of
mr
edward
briskett
the
head
of
the
family
his
business
takes
him
away
from
home
for
several
months
and
his
daughter
is
anxious
to
avail
herself
of
the
opportunity
of
visiting
her
aunt
oh
said
elma
no
more
and
no
less
but
as
she
turned
her
eyes
once
more
to
the
window
she
grimaced
expressively
she
was
sorry
for
the
delusion
of
the
american
daughter
who
was
willing
to
cross
a
whole
ocean
for
the
privilege
of
beholding
miss
sophia
briskett
what
is
she
like
she
asked
presently
did
you
hear
anything
about
her
mrs
ramsden
shook
her
head
dolefully
i
fear
dear
strictly
between
ourselves
that
she
is
not
precisely
what
we
should
call
a
girl
the
tone
of
her
letter
was
decidedly
flippant
miss
briskett
is
hoping
much
from
your
influence
you
two
girls
will
naturally
come
a
good
deal
into
contact
and
i
hope
you
will
do
your
utmost
to
set
her
an
example
of
ladylike
demeanour
elma
stared
steadily
through
the
window
she
repeated
to
herself
in
a
breathless
whisper
the
pansy
eyes
widened
she
heaved
a
sigh
of
deep
incredulous
delight
chapter
three
the
was
due
to
arrive
in
the
mersey
early
on
a
tuesday
forenoon
and
miss
briskett
expected
to
welcome
her
niece
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
the
best
spare
room
was
already
swept
and
garnished
and
nothing
remained
but
to
take
counsel
with
heap
the
cook
and
draw
out
a
menu
of
a
dinner
which
could
most
successfully
combat
the
strain
of
waiting
the
spinster
own
appetite
though
sparse
was
fastidious
and
heap
was
a
mistress
of
her
art
so
that
between
the
two
a
dainty
little
meal
was
arranged
while
mason
not
to
be
outdone
endeavoured
to
impart
an
extra
polish
to
her
already
silver
in
the
seclusion
of
the
pantry
she
hummed
a
joyful
air
praise
the
pigs
we
shall
have
something
young
in
the
house
at
last
said
she
to
herself
i
do
mind
the
extra
work
if
she
only
make
a
bit
of
a
stir
by
six
the
was
laid
and
miss
briskett
was
sitting
in
state
clad
in
her
newest
grey
silk
gown
though
a
reference
to
bradshaw
made
it
seem
improbable
that
the
traveller
could
arrive
before
seven
at
six
hot
water
was
carried
up
to
the
bedroom
ten
minutes
later
miss
briskett
left
her
seat
to
move
another
few
yards
nearer
the
window
streaks
of
colour
showed
in
her
cheeks
her
fingers
clasped
and
unclasped
in
nervous
fashion
she
was
conscious
of
a
quick
at
the
left
side
of
the
bodice
and
realised
with
surprise
that
it
came
from
that
almost
forgotten
organ
her
heart
she
had
never
experienced
this
agitation
before
when
awaiting
the
arrival
of
her
own
friends
the
old
adage
was
right
after
all
blood
was
thicker
than
water
what
would
the
child
be
like
edward
was
a
big
fair
man
with
no
special
beauty
of
feature
sybil
had
been
slight
and
dainty
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
cornelia
would
be
specially
pretty
her
aunt
prayed
above
all
things
that
she
was
unnoticeable
to
be
unnoticeable
was
regarded
as
the
climax
of
elegance
in
norton
society
then
with
a
sudden
softening
of
expression
found
herself
hoping
that
there
would
be
something
of
edward
in
looks
or
manner
she
was
a
lonely
woman
living
apart
from
her
kin
to
have
someone
of
her
own
would
be
a
new
and
delightful
experience
she
felt
glad
actually
that
cornelia
was
coming
seven
at
any
moment
now
a
cab
might
appear
bearing
the
expected
guest
from
the
station
miss
briskett
crossed
the
room
to
alter
the
arrangement
of
a
vase
of
flowers
and
as
she
did
so
the
door
opened
and
mason
entered
carrying
a
telegram
upon
a
silver
salver
miss
briskett
tore
it
open
and
read
the
following
message
safe
and
sound
staying
night
in
london
with
friends
morning
be
with
you
at
five
god
save
the
queen
cornelia
miss
briskett
lips
tightened
she
folded
the
paper
and
returned
it
to
its
envelope
cleared
her
throat
and
said
coldly
inform
heap
that
my
niece
will
not
arrive
until
evening
and
be
good
enough
to
serve
dinner
at
once
mason
face
clouded
with
disappointment
in
the
kitchen
heap
banged
the
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
use
of
doing
your
best
in
a
despicable
world
where
you
never
got
nothing
for
your
pains
mary
repaired
dolefully
upstairs
to
take
away
the
hot
water
and
shroud
the
furniture
in
even
the
tweeny
felt
a
sudden
dampening
of
spirits
while
in
the
the
mistress
of
her
house
sat
at
her
solitary
meal
with
anger
smouldering
in
her
heart
a
delay
to
the
boat
would
of
course
have
been
inevitable
if
cornelia
had
been
so
fatigued
that
she
felt
it
necessary
to
break
her
journey
that
would
have
been
a
disappointment
pure
and
simple
but
that
the
girl
had
to
delay
her
arrival
for
her
own
amusement
and
gratification
this
was
an
offence
indeed
a
want
of
respect
and
consideration
unforgivable
staying
in
town
with
friends
staying
with
what
friends
doing
the
sights
morning
miss
briskett
lip
curled
in
disdain
then
that
ridiculous
ending
what
would
miss
brewster
the
telegraph
clerk
at
the
office
think
of
such
frivolity
in
this
tiny
township
everyone
was
as
well
acquainted
with
their
neighbour
business
as
with
their
own
and
while
emily
brewster
at
the
was
keenly
interested
in
the
advent
of
the
american
visitor
miss
briskett
in
her
turn
knew
all
about
emily
parentage
and
education
the
nature
and
peculiarities
of
the
diseases
which
she
had
enjoyed
and
vouchsafed
a
patronising
interest
in
her
prospects
it
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
feel
sure
that
emily
had
laughed
and
made
merry
over
a
message
addressed
to
a
briskett
from
a
member
of
her
own
house
everyone
has
experienced
the
flatness
which
ensues
when
an
expected
excitement
is
postponed
at
the
last
moment
leaving
the
hours
to
drag
along
a
slow
uneventful
course
it
was
long
since
miss
briskett
had
felt
so
consciously
lonely
and
depressed
as
at
her
solitary
dinner
that
evening
in
the
even
patience
lost
its
wonted
charm
and
she
was
thankful
when
the
time
arrived
to
sip
her
tumbler
of
hot
water
and
retire
to
bed
next
day
it
seemed
somewhat
flat
to
make
the
same
preparations
a
second
time
over
but
as
no
contradictory
message
had
been
received
it
did
not
appear
possible
that
a
second
disappointment
could
supervene
the
table
was
set
out
with
special
care
and
a
supply
of
cakes
placed
on
the
brass
stand
once
more
miss
briskett
donned
her
best
gown
and
sat
gazing
through
the
lace
window
curtains
at
last
a
cab
drove
up
to
the
gate
two
cabs
laden
with
enough
luggage
for
a
family
journeying
to
the
seaside
the
door
of
the
first
was
thrown
open
and
there
jumped
out
a
a
tall
alert
young
man
clad
in
a
suit
of
tweed
who
turned
and
gave
his
hand
to
a
girl
in
blue
serge
carefully
assisting
her
to
alight
they
sauntered
up
the
path
together
laughing
and
chattering
in
leisurely
enjoyment
to
the
house
the
girl
turned
round
and
stood
for
a
moment
to
stare
at
the
view
pointing
as
she
did
so
in
frank
unabashed
fashion
then
they
approached
the
door
held
hospitably
open
in
mason
hand
why
aunt
soph
is
that
you
cried
a
high
clear
voice
with
a
pronounced
american
accent
which
rang
strangely
in
the
unaccustomed
ears
this
is
me
anyhow
and
i
real
glad
to
see
you
i
had
a
lovely
ride
this
is
mr
eustace
c
ross
who
crossed
with
us
in
the
he
brought
me
right
here
in
case
i
got
lost
or
fell
over
the
edge
england
sweet
i
been
all
over
london
this
morning
and
we
did
a
theatre
last
night
aunt
soph
you
have
a
look
of
father
about
the
nose
makes
me
feel
kinder
homesick
to
see
your
nose
going
to
kiss
it
right
away
and
kiss
it
she
did
on
its
thin
chilly
tip
with
mason
sniggering
with
delight
in
the
background
and
the
strange
young
man
chuckling
in
the
foreground
miss
briskett
retreated
hastily
into
the
and
her
niece
followed
casting
curious
glances
to
right
and
to
left
you
got
a
real
cosy
little
house
aunt
soph
it
looks
real
english
not
a
mite
like
our
place
at
home
is
that
tea
i
just
about
dying
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
so
mr
ross
do
you
want
a
cup
of
tea
more
than
anything
in
the
world
mr
ross
i
see
you
do
by
the
way
you
look
she
sank
into
an
easy
chair
and
flashed
a
mischievous
glance
at
the
young
man
by
her
side
he
was
a
tall
young
fellow
with
the
square
shoulders
and
aggressive
chin
which
to
the
english
eye
are
the
leading
characteristics
of
american
men
he
had
the
air
of
being
exceedingly
well
able
to
look
after
himself
but
even
his
possession
wavered
before
the
frosty
nature
of
his
reception
he
stood
irresolutely
hat
in
hand
waiting
for
a
repetition
of
invitation
but
none
came
and
with
an
almost
imperceptible
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
resigned
himself
to
the
inevitable
and
announced
that
it
was
imperative
that
he
should
hasten
back
to
the
station
to
catch
a
return
train
to
town
he
proceeded
therefore
to
take
leave
of
his
travelling
companion
a
proceeding
characterised
on
his
side
by
transparent
regret
on
hers
by
an
equally
transparent
indifference
you
be
sure
to
let
me
know
when
you
come
home
yes
indeed
i
write
when
i
start
and
you
shall
come
down
to
meet
the
boat
you
been
real
kind
i
ever
so
much
obliged
oh
i
enjoyed
it
enormously
you
must
be
sure
to
let
me
know
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
at
any
time
anywhere
repeated
the
young
fellow
ardently
he
bowed
to
miss
briskett
who
extended
her
hand
in
patronising
farewell
accompanying
him
to
the
door
of
the
room
less
it
appeared
from
motives
of
kindliness
than
to
satisfy
herself
that
he
had
really
departed
on
her
return
she
found
that
her
niece
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
sticking
through
the
crown
with
smiling
complacence
miss
briskett
surveyed
her
with
not
unnatural
curiosity
and
came
to
the
swift
conclusion
that
she
was
not
at
all
pretty
but
most
objectionably
remarkable
in
appearance
the
sort
of
girl
whom
people
would
stare
at
in
the
street
the
sort
of
girl
whom
norton
would
emphatically
disapprove
her
hair
in
itself
was
arresting
miss
briskett
had
never
seen
such
hair
it
was
not
red
it
was
not
gold
it
was
not
brown
but
rather
a
blending
of
all
three
colours
it
was
moreover
extraordinarily
thick
and
stood
out
from
the
head
in
a
crisp
mass
rippling
into
big
natural
waves
while
behind
each
ear
was
a
broad
streak
of
a
lighter
shade
almost
flaxen
in
colour
no
artificial
means
could
have
produced
such
an
effect
it
was
obviously
the
work
of
nature
american
nature
miss
briskett
told
herself
with
a
sniff
a
respectably
english
girl
could
never
have
possessed
such
a
head
underneath
this
glorious
mass
of
hair
was
a
pale
little
face
lighted
up
by
a
pair
of
eyes
the
eyebrows
were
marked
and
remarkably
flexible
the
nose
was
thin
and
pointed
a
youthful
replica
of
miss
briskett
own
the
only
really
good
feature
was
the
mouth
and
that
was
adorable
with
coral
red
lips
curling
up
at
the
corners
tempting
kissable
lips
made
for
love
and
laughter
for
the
rest
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
a
plain
blue
serge
gown
could
possibly
contrive
to
look
so
smart
or
how
those
tiniest
of
tiny
brown
boots
had
managed
to
keep
so
dazzlingly
free
from
dust
throughout
a
railway
journey
miss
briskett
sat
herself
down
by
the
and
cleared
her
throat
ominously
her
niece
had
not
been
ten
minutes
in
the
house
yet
already
an
occasion
had
arisen
for
a
serious
rebuke
are
you
engaged
to
that
young
man
may
i
ask
cornelia
cornelia
gave
a
little
jump
upon
her
seat
and
opened
her
golden
eyes
in
a
stare
of
amazement
mussy
no
what
in
the
land
put
such
an
idea
in
your
head
your
tone
and
manner
my
dear
and
the
fact
of
his
accompanying
you
all
the
way
from
town
it
is
not
usual
for
young
men
to
put
themselves
to
so
much
trouble
for
a
mere
acquaintance
he
do
think
it
a
trouble
he
loves
flying
around
he
a
sweet
thing
said
miss
cornelia
with
smiling
recollection
but
he
not
my
chubb
i
sorry
he
could
stay
to
tea
for
he
real
amusing
when
he
once
gets
started
he
have
made
you
screech
with
laughter
miss
briskett
looked
down
her
nose
in
her
most
dignified
and
rebuking
fashion
i
am
not
accustomed
to
about
anything
and
in
this
country
my
dear
it
is
not
considered
convenable
for
young
girls
to
accept
the
escort
of
a
gentleman
to
whom
they
are
not
engaged
no
english
girl
would
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
they
must
have
a
middling
dull
time
of
it
retorted
cornelia
calmly
i
must
teach
them
a
thing
or
two
while
i
over
she
rose
to
take
the
teacup
from
her
aunt
hand
and
to
help
herself
to
a
couple
of
sandwiches
from
a
dainty
dish
well
are
you
pleased
to
have
me
aunt
soph
i
wanted
years
to
come
over
and
see
you
it
seemed
too
bad
that
i
knew
none
of
poppar
people
and
now
i
here
she
wheeled
round
teacup
in
hand
staring
curiously
around
the
handsome
room
at
the
big
ebony
console
table
ornamented
with
bunches
of
fruit
manufactured
out
of
coloured
pebbles
at
the
grand
piano
in
its
walnut
case
the
piano
which
was
never
opened
but
which
served
as
a
stand
for
innumerable
photographs
and
ornaments
at
the
sofas
and
chairs
in
their
glazey
chintz
covers
at
the
vases
on
the
marble
mantelshelf
i
here
and
too
quaint
for
words
everything
i
suppose
england
different
is
it
aunt
soph
very
different
miss
briskett
tones
fairly
bubbled
with
innuendoes
she
put
down
her
rolled
slice
of
bread
and
butter
and
added
frostily
before
we
go
any
further
cornelia
i
must
really
beg
you
to
address
me
by
my
proper
name
my
name
is
sophia
you
have
no
intention
of
being
disrespectful
i
feel
sure
but
i
am
not
accustomed
to
abbreviations
i
have
never
had
a
nickname
in
my
life
and
i
have
no
wish
to
begin
at
this
late
date
my
you
poor
sufferer
how
lonesome
for
you
nicknames
are
so
homely
and
cosy
i
have
about
as
many
as
i
have
toes
one
of
my
friends
calls
me
he
a
bit
of
a
wag
indeed
another
one
calls
me
she
threw
a
lingering
sentiment
into
the
repetition
and
chuckled
reminiscently
to
most
of
my
chums
i
just
life
too
short
for
three
syllables
every
day
of
the
week
over
here
in
england
we
are
not
too
hurried
to
address
people
in
a
proper
manner
i
shall
call
you
by
your
full
name
and
expect
you
to
do
the
same
by
me
all
right
aunt
sophia
ann
just
as
you
please
cried
cornelia
naughtily
she
was
standing
up
cup
in
hand
but
even
as
she
spoke
she
subsided
on
to
a
footstool
by
miss
briskett
side
with
a
sudden
lithe
collapse
of
the
body
which
made
that
good
lady
gasp
in
dismay
she
had
never
seen
anybody
but
a
professional
acrobat
move
so
quickly
or
unexpectedly
and
felt
convinced
that
the
tea
must
have
been
spilt
and
crumbs
scattered
wholesale
over
the
carpet
but
no
not
even
a
drop
had
fallen
into
the
saucer
and
there
sat
cornelia
nibbling
at
an
undamaged
sandwich
with
little
strong
white
teeth
as
cool
and
composed
as
if
such
feats
were
of
everyday
occurrence
this
is
how
i
sit
by
poppar
at
home
it
more
sociable
than
right
across
the
room
poppar
and
i
are
just
the
greatest
chums
and
i
hate
it
when
he
away
there
was
a
real
nice
woman
wanted
to
come
and
keep
house
and
take
me
around
mrs
van
dusen
widow
of
henry
p
van
dusen
who
made
a
boom
in
cheese
maybe
you
heard
of
him
he
made
a
pile
and
lost
it
all
trying
to
do
it
again
then
he
got
tired
of
himself
and
took
the
and
died
and
it
was
pretty
dull
for
mrs
van
she
visits
round
and
puts
in
her
time
the
best
way
she
can
she
have
liked
quite
well
to
settle
down
at
our
place
for
three
or
four
months
and
i
have
liked
it
too
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
wanted
to
see
you
aunt
soph
ia
ann
she
put
up
a
thin
little
hand
and
rubbed
it
ingratiatingly
up
and
down
the
shiny
silk
lap
to
the
stupefaction
of
mason
who
came
in
at
that
moment
bearing
a
plate
of
hot
scones
and
retired
to
give
a
faithful
rendering
of
the
position
to
her
allies
in
the
kitchen
sitting
down
on
the
fender
stool
and
stroking
the
cook
apron
in
dramatic
imitation
while
that
good
lady
and
her
satellites
went
into
helpless
fits
of
laughter
i
as
soon
stroke
a
nettle
myself
said
the
cook
but
there
no
accounting
for
taste
you
take
my
word
for
it
if
she
goes
on
stroking
much
longer
she
get
a
sting
as
she
wo
forget
in
a
hurry
upstairs
in
the
miss
briskett
fidgeting
uncomfortably
beneath
that
caressing
hand
in
her
lonely
life
she
was
so
unused
to
demonstrations
of
the
kind
that
she
was
at
a
loss
how
to
receive
them
when
they
came
instinctively
she
drew
herself
away
shrinking
into
the
corners
of
her
chair
and
busying
herself
with
the
arrangement
of
the
tray
while
cornelia
asked
one
question
after
another
in
her
slightly
monotonous
voice
it
mighty
quiet
out
here
aunt
soph
ia
ann
does
it
always
go
on
being
just
as
still
do
you
live
all
the
year
round
right
here
in
this
house
by
your
lonesome
listening
to
the
grass
growing
across
the
lane
what
do
you
anyway
that
a
real
maid
will
she
be
the
one
to
wait
upon
me
most
all
my
shirt
waists
fasten
up
the
back
and
there
got
to
be
someone
round
to
fix
them
or
i
all
undone
i
guess
you
pretty
tidy
by
the
looks
of
you
aunt
soph
i
ca
see
after
things
myself
but
i
fidget
the
life
out
of
everybody
if
i
not
just
so
i
got
the
sweetest
do
you
have
gay
times
over
here
in
norton
is
there
a
good
deal
of
young
society
i
love
prancing
round
and
having
a
good
time
poppar
says
the
boys
spoil
me
there
always
a
crowd
of
them
hanging
round
ready
to
do
everything
i
want
and
to
send
me
flowers
and
i
just
crazed
on
bonbons
my
was
piled
full
of
bouquets
and
chocolates
coming
over
i
had
more
than
any
other
girl
on
board
miss
briskett
lips
tightened
ominously
if
by
you
mean
young
men
cornelia
i
am
surprised
that
your
father
allows
you
to
receive
indiscriminate
gifts
from
strangers
i
fear
he
hag
become
a
thorough
american
and
forgotten
his
early
training
in
england
no
young
man
would
venture
to
send
a
gift
to
a
lady
to
whom
he
was
not
either
related
or
engaged
to
be
married
my
how
mean
amurican
men
are
for
ever
sending
things
and
the
girls
just
love
to
have
them
do
it
seems
to
me
aunt
soph
it
about
time
i
came
over
to
teach
you
how
to
do
things
in
this
benighted
isle
poppar
says
you
all
pretty
mouldy
but
short
of
an
earthquake
he
think
of
anything
better
calculated
to
shake
you
up
than
a
good
spell
of
me
waltzing
around
i
guess
he
about
right
i
never
quiet
unless
i
sick
there
not
much
of
the
sleeping
beauty
about
cornelia
e
briskett
miss
briskett
sat
still
a
pillar
of
outraged
propriety
this
was
worse
than
anything
she
had
expected
the
girl
appeared
to
have
no
modesty
no
decorum
no
sense
of
shame
she
might
straighten
her
back
until
it
was
as
stiff
as
a
poker
might
arch
her
brows
into
semicircles
and
purse
her
lips
into
an
expression
of
disapproval
which
would
have
frightened
elma
ramsden
out
of
her
senses
but
cornelia
never
appeared
to
notice
that
anything
was
amiss
and
continued
her
meal
with
bland
enjoyment
when
she
had
finished
the
sandwiches
she
rested
her
left
arm
more
firmly
on
her
aunt
knee
and
raised
her
pointed
chin
until
it
rested
actually
rested
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
the
while
she
carefully
scrutinised
the
different
varieties
of
cake
and
selected
the
piece
most
to
her
taste
at
this
she
proceeded
to
nibble
with
evident
satisfaction
lifting
it
to
her
lips
in
one
thin
hand
while
the
other
still
rested
caressingly
on
that
shiny
silk
lap
miss
briskett
dumb
swellings
of
anger
gradually
subsided
to
the
point
when
it
became
possible
to
put
them
into
words
she
cleared
her
throat
with
the
usual
preliminary
grunt
whereupon
the
girl
turned
her
head
to
gaze
questioningly
upwards
her
expression
sweetly
alert
her
eyes
limpid
golden
eyes
widely
opened
between
the
double
line
of
lashes
miss
briskett
looked
and
the
remonstrance
died
on
her
lips
the
scene
shifted
and
in
an
instant
she
had
travelled
back
through
the
years
to
a
day
long
long
ago
when
she
sat
a
girl
in
her
teens
talking
to
the
little
boy
brother
who
was
the
dearest
of
all
created
things
telling
him
stories
and
watching
the
wonder
in
his
eyes
pert
sufficient
and
presumptuous
as
she
might
be
by
some
contradictory
freak
of
nature
that
divine
innocence
still
lingered
in
this
young
girl
eyes
the
sight
of
it
arrested
the
words
on
the
spinster
lips
she
realised
with
shame
that
almost
every
word
which
she
had
spoken
to
the
girl
since
her
arrival
had
been
tinged
with
reproof
and
blushed
for
her
own
lack
of
hospitality
the
frown
faded
and
was
replaced
by
a
struggling
smile
with
a
movement
she
advanced
a
chilly
hand
to
meet
the
girl
warm
grasp
cornelia
drew
a
long
fluttering
sigh
a
sigh
of
utter
contentment
and
laid
her
russet
head
on
the
folds
of
the
stiff
grey
silk
oh
aunt
soph
ia
you
are
just
as
sweet
she
murmured
beneath
her
breath
chapter
four
perfect
health
radiant
spirits
supreme
a
sweetly
smiling
determination
to
have
her
own
way
and
go
her
own
course
though
the
skies
fell
and
all
creation
conspired
to
prevent
her
these
were
the
characteristics
of
miss
cornelia
briskett
most
apparent
on
a
superficial
acquaintance
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
when
mary
the
housemaid
carried
the
cup
of
early
morning
tea
to
her
bedside
she
found
the
young
lady
leaning
back
against
the
pillows
enveloped
in
a
garment
which
suggested
a
garden
party
rather
than
a
wide
awake
and
ready
for
conversation
really
a
most
affable
young
lady
who
instead
of
vouchsafing
a
cool
launched
out
into
quite
a
confidential
talk
inquiring
after
the
different
members
of
family
their
names
ages
and
occupations
and
showing
a
most
sympathetic
interest
in
the
girl
own
future
i
guess
you
are
going
to
be
married
pretty
soon
you
got
a
marrying
face
she
said
shrewdly
whereupon
mary
blushing
acknowledged
that
she
a
friend
and
that
he
speak
of
early
next
spring
told
you
so
cried
cornelia
dimpling
well
mury
see
here
you
nip
round
and
wait
upon
me
the
best
you
know
and
i
give
you
an
elegant
present
i
wear
muslins
most
all
the
time
in
summer
and
i
ca
endoor
to
have
them
mussed
you
keep
carrying
them
away
and
ironing
them
out
nice
and
smooth
without
bothering
me
to
tell
you
see
i
need
lots
of
attention
there
no
getting
away
from
that
but
i
make
it
worth
your
while
you
just
put
your
mind
to
it
and
i
guess
you
make
a
maid
mary
was
at
least
prepared
to
perish
in
the
attempt
she
related
the
conversation
downstairs
with
the
natural
result
that
each
of
the
other
three
maids
registered
a
vow
to
be
second
to
none
in
her
attentions
to
the
young
visitor
the
rang
at
eight
but
it
was
a
good
ten
minutes
later
before
cornelia
came
sauntering
downstairs
singing
an
unknown
ditty
at
the
pitch
of
a
sweet
if
somewhat
nasal
voice
she
was
dressed
in
white
of
the
most
elaborate
simplicity
and
her
shaded
hair
looked
even
more
crisply
conspicuous
than
on
the
night
before
the
last
line
of
the
song
did
not
come
to
an
end
until
she
was
across
the
floor
and
so
far
from
being
dismayed
by
her
aunt
stare
of
disapproval
she
only
laughed
waved
her
hands
and
threw
an
extra
flourish
into
the
rallentando
then
she
swooped
down
upon
the
stiff
figure
hugged
it
affectionately
and
planted
three
kisses
on
the
cold
grey
face
one
on
the
lips
one
on
the
brow
a
third
deliberately
on
the
tip
of
the
nose
cornelia
please
recollect
yourself
my
dear
have
a
little
respect
you
must
never
do
that
again
cried
miss
briskett
irritably
but
the
girl
showed
not
the
faintest
sign
of
being
awed
it
the
nose
of
my
father
and
i
just
to
kiss
it
it
not
a
mite
of
use
promising
that
i
wo
i
got
to
kiss
it
regularly
every
morning
and
every
night
until
he
comes
over
to
be
kissed
himself
she
announced
calmly
seating
herself
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
and
peering
curiously
at
the
various
dishes
poppar
says
you
never
have
anything
for
breakfast
in
england
but
bacon
and
eggs
but
i
do
see
any
here
what
under
this
cover
fish
if
you
wait
a
few
minutes
your
bacon
will
be
brought
in
it
had
grown
cold
with
waiting
so
long
so
i
sent
it
away
to
be
kept
hot
the
breakfast
hour
is
eight
not
a
quarter
past
it
not
a
mite
of
use
telling
me
the
hours
i
always
late
i
suppose
i
ever
been
down
in
time
in
my
life
unless
by
a
mistake
returned
cornelia
cheerfully
i
like
to
stay
in
bed
and
let
the
day
get
sorter
warmed
up
and
comfortable
before
i
begin
what
makes
you
want
to
get
up
so
early
anyway
i
should
have
thought
nine
would
have
been
heaps
early
enough
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
it
was
not
a
promising
beginning
to
the
day
in
her
own
household
miss
briskett
was
accustomed
to
an
authority
as
complete
as
that
of
the
general
of
an
army
she
was
just
and
she
was
generous
her
servants
were
treated
with
kindness
and
consideration
but
if
they
wished
to
retain
their
places
they
had
to
learn
the
lesson
of
dumb
unquestioning
obedience
she
might
be
right
she
might
be
wrong
she
might
remember
she
might
forget
no
matter
it
was
not
their
business
to
enlighten
her
theirs
but
to
do
and
die
she
would
not
brook
a
question
as
to
her
own
authority
it
was
therefore
a
distinct
blow
to
the
good
lady
to
find
her
decrees
ignored
by
her
young
guest
with
a
smiling
more
baffling
than
the
most
determined
opposition
she
remained
stolidly
silent
throughout
the
meal
but
cornelia
apparently
regarded
he
attitude
as
a
tactful
abdication
in
her
own
favour
and
kept
up
an
incessant
flow
of
conversation
from
start
to
finish
when
the
bell
was
rung
for
prayers
she
seated
herself
in
a
low
chair
directly
facing
the
servants
seats
and
smiled
a
dazzling
greeting
to
each
in
turn
they
sat
down
in
their
usual
positions
heads
bent
hands
folded
on
the
middle
of
their
clean
white
aprons
feet
tucked
carefully
out
of
sight
there
was
no
outward
sign
of
irreverence
or
inattention
in
their
demeanour
but
miss
briskett
that
every
single
woman
of
them
was
absorbed
utterly
consumedly
absorbed
in
casting
sly
glances
at
that
distracting
white
vision
in
the
easy
chair
at
the
dully
glowing
hair
the
floating
folds
of
white
the
tiny
extended
feet
she
might
have
read
a
page
of
the
dictionary
and
they
would
not
have
noticed
even
heap
who
was
old
enough
to
know
better
was
edging
sideways
in
her
chair
to
get
a
better
view
when
the
four
dresses
had
rustled
out
of
the
room
cornelia
yawned
and
stretched
herself
like
a
sleepy
luxurious
kitten
then
snoodled
down
once
more
in
her
comfortable
chair
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
aunt
face
while
that
good
lady
bustled
about
the
room
folding
the
newspaper
into
an
accurate
square
and
putting
it
away
in
a
cage
collecting
scattered
envelopes
and
putting
them
in
the
basket
moving
the
on
the
so
that
they
should
stand
at
mathematically
the
same
distance
from
the
central
clock
at
every
movement
she
waited
to
hear
the
expected
can
i
help
you
aunt
sophia
which
right
feeling
would
surely
prompt
in
any
damsel
and
though
her
reply
would
of
a
certainty
have
been
in
the
negative
she
felt
aggrieved
that
the
opportunity
was
not
vouchsafed
she
was
determined
not
to
look
in
the
girl
direction
nor
to
meet
those
watching
eyes
but
presently
in
spite
of
herself
she
felt
a
magnetic
compulsion
to
turn
her
head
to
answer
the
bright
expectant
glance
well
queried
cornelia
smiling
well
what
my
dear
how
are
you
going
to
amuse
me
this
forenoon
miss
briskett
sat
down
suddenly
in
the
nearest
chair
and
suffered
a
mental
collapse
positively
this
view
of
the
situation
had
never
once
dawned
upon
her
unimaginative
brain
mrs
ramsden
had
dimly
wrestled
with
the
problem
solving
it
at
last
with
an
easy
she
can
talk
to
elma
but
the
aunt
and
hostess
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
consideration
for
her
own
comfort
to
think
of
anyone
else
it
had
crossed
her
mind
that
the
girl
might
tire
her
bore
her
worry
her
or
humiliate
her
before
the
neighbours
in
an
occasional
giddy
flight
of
fancy
she
had
even
supposed
it
possible
that
cornelia
might
amuse
her
and
make
life
more
agreeable
but
never
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
had
she
realised
that
she
herself
was
fated
either
to
bore
or
to
amuse
cornelia
in
return
the
discovery
was
a
shock
being
a
just
woman
miss
briskett
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
she
had
been
selfish
and
but
such
do
not
as
a
rule
soften
our
hearts
towards
the
creature
who
has
been
the
means
of
our
enlightenment
miss
briskett
was
annoyed
with
herself
but
she
was
much
more
annoyed
with
cornelia
and
considered
that
she
had
good
reason
to
be
so
i
have
no
time
to
think
of
frivolities
in
the
morning
my
dear
i
am
too
busy
with
household
duties
i
am
now
going
to
the
kitchen
to
interview
my
cook
then
to
the
to
give
out
what
is
needed
for
the
day
and
when
that
is
accomplished
i
shall
go
to
the
shops
to
give
my
orders
if
you
wish
i
shall
be
pleased
to
have
your
company
right
oh
cried
cornelia
nodding
it
will
be
a
lesson
in
your
silly
old
pounds
and
pence
what
do
you
keep
in
your
aunt
soph
nice
things
fruits
candy
cake
i
would
mind
giving
out
the
stores
for
a
spell
now
and
again
well
i
just
mouch
round
and
be
ready
for
you
when
you
set
out
for
your
walk
miss
briskett
left
the
room
in
blissful
ignorance
of
what
mouch
might
mean
and
much
too
dignified
to
inquire
but
by
the
time
that
ten
had
struck
she
had
learnt
to
connect
the
expression
with
all
that
was
irritating
and
presumptuous
in
the
midst
of
her
discussion
with
the
cook
for
instance
the
sound
of
music
burst
upon
her
ears
the
echo
of
that
disused
piano
which
had
almost
forgotten
to
be
anything
but
a
stand
for
ornaments
and
lamps
bang
went
the
bass
crash
went
the
treble
the
tune
a
dance
played
with
a
dash
and
a
spirt
a
rollicking
marking
of
time
irresistible
to
any
human
creature
under
forty
who
did
not
suffer
from
corns
on
their
toes
in
the
recesses
of
the
scullery
a
subdued
scuffling
was
heard
tweeny
was
stepping
it
to
and
fro
saucepans
in
hand
from
the
overhead
where
mason
was
clearing
away
the
breakfast
dishes
came
a
succession
of
mysterious
bumping
sounds
heap
stood
stolid
as
a
rock
but
her
eyes
her
small
pale
querulous
eyes
danced
a
deliberate
waltz
round
the
table
and
back
i
must
request
cornelia
not
to
play
the
piano
in
the
morning
said
miss
briskett
to
herself
from
the
upstairs
a
sound
of
talking
and
laughing
was
heard
from
within
the
visitor
bedroom
where
sat
that
young
lady
in
state
issuing
orders
to
mary
who
was
blissfully
employed
in
unpacking
the
contents
of
one
of
the
big
dress
boxes
and
hanging
up
skirts
in
the
mahogany
wardrobe
i
must
beg
cornelia
not
to
interfere
with
the
servants
work
in
the
morning
said
miss
briskett
once
more
at
ten
silence
reigned
and
she
went
downstairs
equipped
in
her
black
silk
mantle
and
her
third
best
bonnet
to
announce
her
readiness
to
start
on
the
usual
morning
round
cornelia
was
not
in
the
she
was
not
in
the
though
abundant
signs
of
her
recent
presence
were
visible
in
the
littered
ornaments
on
the
open
piano
i
must
beg
cornelia
to
put
things
back
in
their
proper
places
said
miss
briskett
a
third
time
as
she
crossed
the
hall
to
the
this
room
also
was
empty
but
even
as
she
grasped
the
fact
miss
briskett
started
with
dismay
to
behold
a
bareheaded
figure
leaning
over
the
garden
gate
elbows
propped
on
the
topmost
bar
and
chin
supported
on
clasped
hands
this
time
she
did
not
pause
to
determine
what
commands
she
should
issue
in
the
future
but
stepped
hastily
down
the
path
to
take
immediate
and
peremptory
measures
my
dear
in
the
front
garden
without
a
hat
leaning
over
the
gate
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
the
neighbours
might
see
you
cornelia
turned
in
lazy
amusement
well
if
it
going
to
be
a
shock
to
them
they
might
as
well
begin
early
and
get
it
over
she
ran
a
surprised
eye
over
her
aunt
severe
attire
my
aunt
soph
you
look
too
good
to
live
i
frightened
of
you
in
that
bonnet
if
given
a
hoot
from
the
window
i
have
hustled
up
and
not
kept
you
waiting
just
hang
on
two
shakes
while
i
get
my
hat
i
wo
stay
to
prink
i
am
not
accustomed
began
miss
briskett
automatically
but
she
spoke
to
thin
air
cornelia
had
flown
up
the
path
in
a
cloud
of
swirling
skirts
cries
of
mury
mury
sounded
from
within
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
slowly
retraced
her
steps
and
seated
herself
to
await
the
next
appearance
of
the
whirlwind
with
what
patience
she
could
command
it
was
long
in
coming
the
clock
ticked
a
slow
quarter
of
an
hour
and
was
approaching
twenty
minutes
when
footsteps
sounded
once
more
and
cornelia
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
had
not
changed
her
dress
she
had
not
donned
her
jacket
her
long
white
gloves
dangled
from
her
hand
to
judge
from
appearances
she
had
spent
a
solid
twenty
minutes
in
putting
on
a
hat
which
had
been
trimmed
with
bows
of
dainty
flowered
ribbon
on
the
principle
of
the
more
the
merrier
miss
briskett
disapproved
of
the
hat
it
dipped
over
the
forehead
giving
an
obviously
artificial
air
of
demureness
to
the
features
it
tilted
up
at
the
back
revealing
the
objectionable
hair
in
all
its
wanton
profusion
it
looked
and
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
to
which
norton
objected
it
was
a
garment
which
differentiated
itself
from
its
fellows
aunt
and
niece
walked
down
the
path
together
in
the
direction
of
the
south
lodge
the
latter
putting
innumerable
questions
to
which
the
former
replied
in
shocked
surprise
what
were
those
gardens
across
the
road
they
were
private
property
of
householders
in
the
did
they
have
fine
jinks
over
there
in
summer
time
the
householders
in
the
park
never
under
any
circumstances
indulged
in
jinks
they
disapproved
thoroughly
and
on
principle
of
anything
connected
with
jinks
think
of
that
now
the
poor
deluded
creatures
what
did
they
use
the
gardens
for
anyway
the
gardens
were
used
for
an
occasional
promenade
and
were
also
valuable
as
forming
a
screen
between
the
park
and
the
houses
on
the
western
what
was
wrong
with
the
houses
on
the
western
road
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
houses
in
question
the
residents
in
the
park
objected
to
see
or
to
be
seen
by
houses
however
desirable
they
wished
to
ensure
for
themselves
an
unbroken
and
uninterrupted
my
gracious
mrs
phipps
the
dragon
of
the
south
lodge
came
out
to
the
doorstep
and
bobbed
respectfully
as
miss
briskett
passed
by
but
curiosity
was
rampant
upon
her
features
cornelia
smiled
radiantly
upon
her
she
smiled
upon
everyone
she
met
and
threw
bright
curious
glances
to
right
and
to
left
my
is
it
my
is
it
still
where
everyone
anyway
have
they
got
a
funeral
in
every
house
seems
kind
of
unsociable
muffling
themselves
up
behind
these
hedgerows
over
with
us
if
we
got
a
good
thing
we
not
so
eager
to
hide
it
away
you
can
walk
along
the
sidewalk
and
see
everything
that
going
on
in
the
towns
the
families
camp
out
on
the
doorsteps
it
real
lively
and
sociable
are
these
your
stores
they
look
as
if
they
been
made
in
the
year
one
they
were
in
truth
a
quaint
little
row
butcher
grocer
greengrocer
and
all
nestled
into
a
little
angle
between
two
long
outstanding
buildings
which
seemed
threatening
at
every
moment
to
fall
down
and
crush
them
to
atoms
the
windows
were
small
and
the
space
inside
decidedly
limited
and
this
morning
there
was
an
unusual
rush
of
customers
it
seemed
as
if
every
housewife
in
the
neighbourhood
had
sallied
forth
to
make
her
purchases
at
the
exact
hour
when
miss
briskett
was
known
to
do
her
daily
shopping
at
the
grocer
counter
cornelia
was
introduced
to
mrs
beaumont
of
the
croft
my
niece
miss
cornelia
briskett
mrs
beaumont
murmured
miss
briskett
mrs
repeated
cornelia
loudly
with
a
gracious
sidelong
observance
at
which
unusual
manner
of
receiving
an
introduction
both
ladies
stared
in
surprise
presently
mrs
beaumont
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
put
an
important
question
how
do
you
like
england
i
think
it
lovely
said
cornelia
in
the
fishmonger
shop
mrs
rhodes
and
mrs
muir
came
up
in
their
turn
and
opened
wide
eyes
of
surprise
as
the
strange
girl
again
repeated
their
names
in
her
high
monotone
evidently
this
was
an
american
custom
strange
people
the
americans
the
ladies
simpered
and
put
the
inevitable
query
how
do
you
like
england
i
think
it
sweet
said
cornelia
the
draper
shop
was
a
revelation
of
methods
one
looking
assistant
endeavoured
to
attend
to
three
counters
and
half
a
dozen
customers
with
an
unruffled
calm
which
they
vainly
strove
to
emulate
miss
briskett
produced
a
pattern
of
grey
ribbon
which
she
wished
to
match
four
different
boxes
were
lifted
down
from
the
wall
and
their
contents
ransacked
in
vain
while
the
patient
waiters
received
small
sops
in
the
shape
of
cases
and
trays
shoved
along
to
their
corner
of
the
counter
when
persuasion
failed
to
convince
miss
briskett
that
an
elephant
grey
exactly
matched
her
silvery
fragment
i
see
if
we
have
it
in
stock
cried
the
damsel
hopefully
and
promptly
disappeared
into
space
the
minutes
passed
by
cornelia
frowned
and
fidgeted
was
introduced
to
a
fourth
dame
and
declared
that
england
was
weary
waiters
for
flannel
and
looked
at
their
watches
and
fidgeted
restlessly
but
no
one
rebelled
nor
showed
any
inclination
to
walk
out
of
the
shop
in
disgust
at
length
the
assistant
reappeared
flushed
and
panting
to
regret
that
they
were
sold
out
and
what
is
your
next
pleasure
madam
madam
next
pleasure
was
a
skein
of
wool
which
investigation
again
failed
to
produce
but
we
have
a
very
nice
line
in
kid
gloves
can
i
show
you
something
in
that
line
this
morning
miss
briskett
refused
to
be
tempted
and
produced
a
coin
from
her
purse
in
payment
of
a
small
account
cornelia
was
interested
to
be
introduced
to
and
tried
to
calculate
what
would
be
left
after
the
subtraction
of
a
mysterious
she
had
abundant
time
to
calculate
for
to
the
suspicious
mind
it
might
really
appear
as
if
the
assistant
had
emigrated
to
foreign
climes
with
the
as
capital
in
hand
the
little
shop
was
dull
and
stuffy
an
odour
of
flannel
filled
the
air
the
faces
of
the
patient
waiters
were
colourless
and
depressed
cornelia
flounced
on
her
seat
and
curled
her
beautiful
lips
my
stars
and
stripes
she
cried
aloud
i
take
root
if
i
sit
here
much
longer
seems
as
that
change
wo
be
ready
till
the
last
trump
she
sprang
from
her
chair
as
she
spoke
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
impatience
to
note
the
petrifaction
of
horror
on
the
faces
of
the
waiters
at
the
counter
and
in
the
doorway
came
face
to
face
with
a
plump
dignified
little
lady
accompanied
by
a
girl
in
navy
blue
how
do
you
do
my
dear
i
am
mrs
ramsden
said
the
stoat
lady
holding
out
her
hand
with
a
very
pleasant
friendliness
as
the
niece
of
my
dear
friend
and
neighbour
allow
me
to
give
you
a
hearty
welcome
to
our
shores
this
is
my
daughter
elma
with
whom
i
hope
you
will
be
great
friends
i
will
leave
you
to
talk
together
while
i
make
my
purchases
young
people
always
get
on
better
alone
she
smiled
a
kind
motherly
smile
nodding
her
head
the
while
until
the
upright
feather
quivered
on
its
stem
then
disappeared
through
the
dingy
portals
leaving
the
two
girls
on
the
narrow
pavement
staring
at
each
other
with
bright
curious
eyes
how
how
do
you
like
england
queried
elma
shyly
and
cornelia
answered
with
a
happy
laugh
i
been
asked
that
question
hef
a
dozen
times
already
and
i
only
set
foot
on
these
shores
day
before
yesterday
i
think
it
seems
a
real
good
place
for
a
nerve
rest
but
if
you
want
to
hustle
she
shrugged
expressively
and
elma
smiled
with
quick
understanding
ah
you
have
been
shopping
at
willcox
but
willcox
is
not
england
norton
is
not
england
it
just
a
sleepy
little
backwater
shut
away
from
the
great
current
of
life
do
judge
england
by
what
you
see
here
you
like
the
england
you
could
help
liking
that
i
like
said
cornelia
bluntly
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
gesture
of
frank
camaraderie
and
elma
clasped
it
thrilling
with
pleasure
a
happy
conviction
assured
her
that
she
had
found
a
friend
after
her
own
heart
chapter
five
by
the
time
that
cornelia
had
been
a
week
in
residence
at
the
nook
she
had
become
the
one
absorbing
topic
of
norton
conversation
and
her
aunt
attitude
towards
her
was
an
odd
mingling
of
shame
and
pride
on
principle
the
spinster
disapproved
of
almost
everything
that
the
girl
did
or
said
and
suffered
every
day
a
succession
of
electric
shocks
but
as
we
all
know
such
shocks
are
guaranteed
to
exercise
a
bracing
influence
on
the
constitution
and
miss
briskett
was
conscious
of
feeling
brighter
and
more
alert
than
for
many
years
past
she
no
longer
reigned
as
monarch
over
all
she
surveyed
a
czar
of
russia
suddenly
confronted
by
a
duma
of
radical
principles
and
audacious
energy
could
not
feel
more
proudly
aggrieved
and
antagonistic
but
it
is
conceivable
that
a
czar
might
cherish
a
secret
affection
for
the
leader
of
an
opposition
who
showed
himself
honest
clever
and
affectionate
in
conclave
with
her
own
heart
miss
briskett
acknowledged
that
she
cherished
a
distinct
partiality
for
her
niece
but
in
view
of
the
said
niece
tendency
to
conceit
the
partiality
was
rigorously
concealed
as
for
norton
society
it
welcomed
cornelia
with
open
arms
that
is
to
say
all
the
old
ladies
of
miss
briskett
acquaintance
called
upon
her
inquired
if
she
liked
england
and
sent
their
maids
round
the
following
day
with
neat
little
notes
inviting
aunt
and
niece
to
take
tea
on
a
certain
afternoon
at
four
these
soon
became
a
daily
occurrence
and
cornelia
attitude
towards
them
was
one
of
consecutive
anticipation
amusement
and
ennui
you
dressed
up
in
your
best
clothes
you
sat
in
rows
round
a
stuffy
room
you
drank
stewed
tea
and
ate
buttered
cakes
you
met
every
day
the
same
everlastingly
the
same
ladies
dressed
in
the
same
garments
and
listened
every
day
to
the
same
futile
talk
from
the
older
ladies
criticisms
of
last
sunday
sermon
and
details
of
household
grievances
from
the
younger
you
seen
miss
horby
new
hat
you
hear
the
latest
about
the
briggs
i
going
to
have
blue
with
lace
insertions
cornelia
bore
it
meekly
for
a
week
on
end
and
then
she
struck
two
notes
were
discovered
lying
upon
the
containing
invitations
to
two
more
so
kind
of
them
you
will
like
to
go
wo
you
my
dear
said
miss
briskett
pouring
out
coffee
no
i
sha
then
answered
cornelia
ladling
out
bacon
her
curling
lips
were
pressed
together
her
flexible
eyebrows
wrinkled
towards
the
nose
if
edward
b
briskett
had
been
present
he
would
have
recognised
signals
of
breakers
ahead
i
guess
i
about
full
up
of
i
not
going
to
any
more
this
side
jordan
not
going
my
dear
miss
briskett
choked
with
mingled
amazement
and
dismay
why
not
if
you
please
you
have
no
other
engagements
my
friends
pay
you
the
honour
of
an
invitation
it
is
my
wish
that
you
accept
you
surely
can
not
mean
what
you
are
saying
she
stared
across
the
table
in
her
most
dignified
and
fashion
but
cornelia
refused
to
meet
her
eyes
devoting
her
entire
attention
to
the
consumption
of
her
breakfast
you
bet
i
do
cornelia
how
often
must
i
beg
you
not
to
use
that
exceedingly
objectionable
expression
i
ask
you
a
simple
question
please
answer
it
without
exaggeration
why
do
you
object
to
accompany
me
to
these
two
parties
because
it
a
waste
of
time
it
against
my
principles
to
have
the
same
tooth
drawn
six
times
over
i
know
all
i
want
to
about
in
england
and
i
ready
to
pass
on
to
something
fresh
i
go
clean
crazed
if
i
to
sit
through
that
performance
again
i
am
sorry
you
have
been
so
bored
i
hoped
you
had
enjoyed
yourself
said
miss
briskett
stiffly
but
with
an
underlying
disappointment
in
her
tone
which
cornelia
was
quick
to
recognise
the
imps
of
temper
and
obstinacy
which
had
peeped
out
of
her
golden
eyes
suddenly
disappeared
from
view
and
she
nodded
a
cheery
reassurement
i
was
a
mite
bored
at
the
start
i
loved
going
round
with
you
and
seeing
your
friends
but
i
seen
them
and
they
seen
me
and
we
said
all
we
want
to
so
that
trick
is
played
out
you
ca
go
on
drinking
tea
with
the
same
old
ladies
all
the
days
of
your
life
why
ca
they
hit
on
something
fresh
miss
briskett
did
not
reply
she
was
indeed
too
much
upset
for
words
was
the
only
form
of
dissipation
in
which
she
and
her
friends
indulged
or
had
indulged
for
many
years
past
in
more
energetic
days
an
occasional
dinner
had
varied
the
monotony
but
as
time
crept
on
there
seemed
a
dozen
reasons
for
dropping
the
more
elaborate
form
of
entertainment
a
upset
the
servants
it
necessitated
the
resurrection
of
the
best
from
the
china
cupboard
and
the
best
silver
from
the
safe
it
entailed
late
hours
a
sense
of
responsibility
the
exertion
of
entertaining
how
much
simpler
to
buy
a
sixpenny
jar
of
cream
and
a
few
shillings
worth
of
cake
welcome
your
friends
at
four
and
be
free
at
five
to
lie
down
on
the
sofa
and
have
a
nap
before
dressing
for
dinner
miss
briskett
had
counted
on
a
protracted
orgy
of
in
her
niece
honour
and
had
already
planned
a
return
bout
on
her
own
accord
to
set
the
ball
rolling
a
second
time
her
wildest
flight
of
fancy
had
not
soared
beyond
tea
and
here
was
cornelia
showing
signs
of
rebellion
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
it
said
much
for
the
impression
which
that
young
lady
had
made
that
there
was
a
note
of
actual
entreaty
in
the
voice
in
which
her
aunt
addressed
her
i
think
you
must
reconsider
your
decision
cornelia
i
strongly
wish
you
to
accept
these
invitations
and
my
friends
will
be
much
disappointed
if
you
refuse
when
you
understand
the
position
i
feel
sure
you
will
put
your
own
wishes
on
one
side
and
consent
to
do
what
is
right
and
fitting
but
miss
cornelia
tossed
her
head
and
the
impish
light
flashed
back
into
her
golden
eyes
i
ke
break
my
word
she
said
bluntly
in
moments
of
friction
her
american
accent
was
even
more
strongly
marked
than
usual
which
fact
was
not
calculated
to
soften
her
aunt
irritation
poppar
had
me
taught
to
say
a
thing
and
stick
to
it
no
matter
how
i
suffered
i
i
wo
go
and
i
not
if
all
the
old
ladies
in
christendom
were
to
come
and
howl
at
the
door
you
ken
tell
i
come
out
in
spots
and
you
reckon
i
going
down
with
that
would
not
be
true
oh
shucks
shrugged
cornelia
troth
is
a
fine
institootion
but
like
most
old
things
it
gives
out
at
times
and
then
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
fall
back
upon
good
imagination
miss
briskett
rose
majestically
from
her
seat
and
left
the
room
cornelia
lifted
the
remnant
of
bread
which
lay
beside
her
plate
raised
it
high
above
her
head
and
deliberately
pitched
it
to
the
end
of
the
room
it
hit
against
the
wall
and
fell
over
the
carpet
in
a
shower
of
crumbs
she
chuckled
malevolently
gave
the
table
a
vicious
shove
on
one
side
and
rose
in
her
turn
on
one
of
the
tables
by
the
window
stood
a
neat
little
pile
of
books
she
lifted
the
topmost
and
thrusting
it
under
her
arm
marched
deliberately
down
the
garden
path
to
the
front
gate
and
thence
across
the
road
towards
the
gate
leading
into
the
plantation
it
was
a
hot
sunny
day
and
up
the
green
knoll
stood
an
oak
tree
whose
spreading
branches
made
delightful
dapplings
of
shade
here
also
a
gentle
breeze
rustled
the
leaves
to
and
fro
while
in
the
stuffy
paths
below
the
air
itself
seemed
exhausted
and
bereft
of
life
cornelia
lifted
her
white
skirts
with
a
display
of
slim
brown
ankles
which
would
have
scandalised
the
norton
worthies
stepped
neatly
and
cleanly
over
the
wire
arches
and
made
a
across
the
grass
for
the
forbidden
spot
she
was
in
the
mood
when
it
seemed
an
absolute
necessity
to
defy
somebody
and
even
a
printed
notice
was
better
than
nothing
she
seated
herself
aggressively
in
the
most
conspicuous
position
on
the
side
of
the
tree
facing
the
houses
spread
wide
her
skirts
on
either
side
folded
her
arms
and
awaited
developments
i
hope
they
look
out
and
see
me
sitting
on
their
old
grass
i
hope
they
come
over
and
stand
in
on
the
path
telling
me
that
nice
young
girls
never
sat
on
the
grass
in
england
then
i
tell
what
think
i
just
in
the
mood
to
do
it
seems
as
if
i
had
drawn
a
free
breath
for
weeks
cornelia
this
country
we
always
this
country
we
never
my
stars
and
stripes
why
did
i
leave
my
happy
home
round
the
corner
of
the
path
there
came
into
view
the
figure
of
morris
keeper
of
the
south
lodge
sweeping
the
gravel
path
his
head
bent
over
his
task
cornelia
naughty
eyes
sent
out
a
flash
of
delight
she
cleared
her
throat
in
a
deliberate
hem
cleared
it
again
and
coughed
in
conclusion
morris
leant
on
his
broom
surveyed
the
landscape
and
visibly
reeled
at
the
sight
of
such
barefaced
trespassing
the
broom
was
hoisted
against
a
tree
while
he
himself
mounted
the
sloping
path
shading
his
eyes
from
the
sun
at
the
first
glance
he
had
recognised
the
young
lady
whose
doings
and
clothings
particularly
clothings
had
formed
the
unvarying
theme
of
his
conversation
for
the
last
fortnight
he
had
committed
himself
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
rather
fancied
the
looks
of
her
but
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
the
feeling
lingered
that
for
a
born
lady
she
was
a
trifle
free
morris
was
a
survival
of
the
old
feudal
type
who
knew
his
place
and
enjoyed
being
trampled
under
foot
by
his
betters
if
an
employer
addressed
him
in
terms
of
kindly
consideration
his
gratitude
was
tinged
with
contempt
these
were
not
the
manners
of
the
good
old
gentry
in
whose
service
he
had
been
trained
opposite
the
oak
tree
he
came
to
a
stand
and
assumed
his
official
manner
beg
pardon
miss
visitors
his
not
permitted
on
the
graws
for
the
land
sake
why
not
it
against
the
rules
miss
suppose
it
is
what
will
happen
if
i
break
morris
looked
discomfited
pushed
his
hat
from
his
forehead
and
murmured
vaguely
that
he
she
be
punished
who
by
who
does
the
grass
belong
to
anyhow
to
yer
rant
miss
and
the
hother
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
owns
the
park
well
and
what
could
do
morris
still
vague
and
uncomfortable
murmured
concerning
prosecution
what
prosecution
queried
cornelia
sounds
exciting
anyway
much
more
exciting
than
sitting
on
the
gravel
paths
guess
i
stay
where
i
am
and
find
out
you
get
on
with
your
work
and
keep
calm
and
when
the
fun
begins
you
can
waltz
in
and
play
your
part
it
no
use
officer
trying
to
arrest
me
though
you
need
a
for
fight
to
the
death
you
might
give
them
the
tip
morris
walked
down
hill
in
stunned
surprise
leaving
cornelia
to
chuckle
to
herself
in
restored
good
humour
her
impulses
towards
rebellion
and
repentance
were
alike
swift
and
speedy
but
between
the
two
lay
a
span
of
licence
when
she
revelled
in
revolt
and
felt
the
tingling
of
riotous
success
such
a
moment
was
the
present
as
she
watched
dumb
retreat
and
cast
her
dancing
eyes
around
in
search
of
the
next
victim
for
the
moment
no
living
creature
was
in
sight
but
the
scene
was
sufficiently
entrancing
to
justify
the
statement
that
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
so
charming
as
england
on
a
fine
june
day
it
was
hot
but
not
too
hot
to
be
exhausting
little
fleecy
white
clouds
flecked
the
blue
dome
overhead
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
odour
of
flowering
trees
now
in
the
height
of
their
beauty
the
gardener
who
had
planted
them
had
possessed
a
nice
eye
for
colour
and
much
skill
in
gaining
the
desired
effects
the
golden
rain
of
laburnum
and
deep
rich
red
of
hawthorn
were
thrown
up
against
the
dark
lustre
of
or
the
misty
green
of
a
graceful
fir
tree
white
and
purple
lilac
were
divided
by
a
light
pink
thorn
and
on
the
tall
chestnuts
the
red
and
white
blossoms
shone
like
candles
on
a
giant
christmas
tree
it
was
the
one
week
when
everything
seems
in
bloom
at
the
same
time
the
week
which
presages
the
end
of
spring
more
beautiful
than
summer
as
promise
is
ever
more
perfect
than
fulfilment
even
the
stiff
crescent
of
houses
looked
picturesque
viewed
through
the
softening
screen
of
green
cornelia
scanned
the
row
of
upper
windows
with
smiling
curiosity
no
one
was
visible
no
one
ever
visible
at
a
window
at
norton
park
but
discreetly
hidden
by
the
lace
curtains
half
a
dozen
heads
might
even
now
be
nodding
in
her
my
dear
is
that
white
figure
under
the
oak
tree
i
thought
at
first
it
must
be
a
sheep
but
it
is
evidently
a
female
of
some
description
it
looks
exceedingly
like
but
it
could
not
be
it
could
not
be
miss
briskett
niece
miss
briskett
niece
chuckled
and
turned
her
head
to
look
up
the
sloping
path
her
choice
of
position
had
been
largely
decided
by
the
fact
that
elma
ramsden
was
due
to
return
by
this
route
from
a
weekly
music
lesson
somewhere
about
the
present
time
in
the
course
of
the
past
week
the
two
girls
had
drunk
tea
in
the
same
houses
every
afternoon
and
exchanged
sympathetic
glances
across
a
phalanx
of
elderly
ladies
but
the
chances
for
conversations
had
been
disappointingly
few
and
this
morning
cornelia
had
a
craving
for
a
companion
young
enough
to
encourage
her
in
her
rebellion
or
at
least
to
understand
the
vitality
which
had
brought
it
to
a
head
she
watched
eagerly
for
the
advent
of
the
tall
figure
elma
always
wore
dark
blue
cambric
on
ordinary
occasions
so
useful
said
her
mother
and
such
a
saving
in
the
washing
bill
mother
and
daughter
ran
up
the
plain
breadths
in
the
sewing
machine
and
the
only
fitting
in
the
body
was
compassed
by
a
at
the
waist
it
did
not
seem
a
matter
of
moment
to
mrs
ramsden
whether
the
said
string
was
an
inch
higher
or
lower
and
elma
was
economical
in
belts
expression
was
eloquent
as
she
viewed
the
outline
of
the
english
figure
as
she
slowly
approached
down
the
narrow
path
so
far
elma
had
not
noticed
her
presence
she
was
too
much
buried
in
her
own
dreams
poor
pretty
thing
that
was
all
that
was
left
to
her
to
take
it
out
in
dreams
she
had
not
yet
begun
to
be
awake
chapter
six
twenty
yards
farther
elma
came
to
a
halt
eyes
and
lips
opened
wide
in
gaping
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
the
trespasser
cornelia
you
are
sitting
on
the
grass
that
so
why
should
i
if
i
a
mind
it
forbidden
oh
shucks
cried
cornelia
impatiently
who
by
elma
waved
her
hand
vaguely
towards
the
crescent
of
houses
everybody
all
of
them
it
a
rule
they
all
agreed
suppose
they
did
i
guess
it
would
take
more
than
ten
old
ladies
to
prevent
me
doing
what
i
want
what
the
good
of
grass
anyway
if
you
ca
enjoy
it
it
lovely
up
here
i
as
cool
as
an
otter
you
look
pretty
warm
after
your
walk
step
over
and
come
right
here
by
me
she
patted
the
ground
beside
her
and
smiled
in
her
most
irresistible
fashion
we
have
the
loveliest
talk
elma
hesitated
fascinated
but
dismayed
i
dare
it
breaking
the
rules
what
would
they
say
that
what
we
got
to
find
out
they
ca
kill
us
anyway
and
we
have
had
a
good
time
first
you
got
to
pay
your
bills
in
this
wicked
world
now
then
hustle
i
ca
faltered
elma
and
lifted
one
foot
over
the
wire
arch
i
dare
and
stepped
completely
over
lifting
her
skirt
behind
her
the
deed
was
done
a
tingle
of
excitement
ran
through
her
veins
she
reared
her
head
and
laughed
aloud
looking
with
bright
unashamed
eyes
at
the
curtained
windows
the
moment
of
revolt
had
come
a
moment
long
desired
in
the
depths
of
a
meek
heart
and
prepared
for
by
many
a
seething
inward
struggle
cornelia
had
applied
the
match
and
the
tow
blazed
elma
laughed
again
and
seated
herself
beneath
the
tree
cornelia
had
tossed
her
hat
on
the
ground
and
clasped
her
hands
round
her
knees
in
comfortable
inelegant
position
elma
did
the
same
and
the
american
girl
watching
her
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
reckless
radiance
of
her
smile
the
sunshine
flickered
down
between
the
branches
on
the
sweet
pink
and
white
face
the
pansy
blue
eyes
and
long
slender
throat
it
shone
alike
on
the
gown
the
clumsy
shoes
the
carelessly
arranged
hair
cornelia
golden
eyes
travelled
up
and
down
down
and
up
in
earnest
scrutinising
fashion
she
met
elma
glance
with
a
shake
of
the
head
forbearing
yet
reproachful
say
you
do
know
how
to
prink
do
you
prink
elma
was
doubtful
even
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
she
arched
her
brows
in
inquiry
whereat
cornelia
laughed
aloud
you
are
real
genuine
english
you
make
me
think
of
roses
and
cream
and
honey
and
mountain
dew
and
everything
that
sweet
and
wholesome
and
takes
no
thought
of
the
morrow
if
you
lived
over
with
us
we
fix
you
up
so
your
own
mother
would
know
you
and
there
be
paragraphs
about
you
in
the
papers
every
single
day
saying
what
you
did
and
what
you
were
wearing
and
how
you
looked
when
you
wore
it
elma
ramsden
sat
on
the
grass
attired
in
a
blue
rag
with
freckles
on
her
nose
my
no
cornelia
chuckled
they
spread
it
pretty
thick
when
they
once
begin
you
have
every
adjective
in
the
dictionary
emptied
over
you
irresistible
elma
miss
ramsden
beauteous
english
rose
half
the
time
it
only
bluff
but
with
you
it
would
be
a
true
bill
you
beautiful
do
you
know
it
the
pink
flush
deepened
in
elma
delicate
face
am
i
she
asked
wistfully
really
oh
i
hope
you
are
right
i
should
be
so
happy
if
it
were
true
but
but
i
afraid
it
ca
be
no
one
notices
me
no
one
seems
to
think
i
am
nice
i
only
just
elma
ramsden
not
radiant
nor
irresistible
nor
anything
of
the
kind
plain
elma
ramsden
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
the
trees
in
the
park
since
you
came
here
in
one
fortnight
you
had
more
attention
than
i
had
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
echoed
cornelia
shrilly
and
rolled
her
eyes
to
the
firmament
attention
you
ken
sit
there
and
look
me
in
the
face
and
talk
about
the
that
been
paid
me
the
last
two
weeks
you
crazed
where
does
the
attention
come
in
i
want
to
know
i
have
spoken
to
a
single
man
since
the
day
i
arrived
you
do
call
a
dozen
old
ladies
clucking
round
do
you
where
all
the
young
men
anyhow
i
have
been
used
to
a
heap
of
men
society
and
i
kind
of
lost
without
it
i
call
attention
having
half
a
dozen
nice
boys
to
play
about
and
do
whatever
i
want
do
you
ever
have
any
nice
young
men
to
take
you
round
elma
dissent
was
tinged
with
shocked
surprise
for
she
had
been
educated
in
the
theory
that
it
was
unmaidenly
to
think
about
the
opposite
sex
true
experience
had
proved
that
this
was
an
impossibility
for
thoughts
took
wing
and
flew
where
they
would
and
dreams
grew
of
themselves
dreams
of
someone
big
and
strong
and
tender
someone
who
would
and
fill
the
void
in
one
heart
which
ached
sometimes
and
called
for
more
more
refusing
to
be
satisfied
with
food
and
raiment
sometimes
the
dream
took
a
definite
shape
insisted
on
the
possession
of
grey
eyes
and
wide
square
shoulders
associating
itself
with
the
personality
of
a
certain
young
squire
of
racing
tendencies
at
whom
all
park
dwellers
glanced
askance
refusing
to
him
the
honour
of
their
hospitality
there
remained
however
certain
functions
at
which
this
outlaw
must
annually
be
encountered
functions
when
one
was
thrillingly
conscious
of
being
signalled
out
for
unusual
attention
one
remembered
for
example
being
escorted
to
eat
ices
under
the
shade
of
an
arbour
of
crimson
ramblers
of
talking
with
tongues
about
the
weather
and
the
flowers
and
the
music
while
grey
eyes
looked
into
blue
and
said
unutterable
things
oh
the
beauty
of
the
sky
seen
through
those
rosy
branches
oh
the
glory
of
the
sun
there
had
never
been
such
a
summer
day
before
elma
trembled
at
the
remembrance
and
then
blushed
at
her
own
audacity
it
was
terrible
to
have
to
acknowledge
such
things
to
one
inmost
heart
but
to
put
them
into
words
she
pursed
her
lips
and
looked
demurely
scandalised
by
her
companion
plain
speaking
do
you
know
cornelia
she
had
been
commanded
to
use
the
christian
name
but
it
still
came
with
a
certain
amount
of
hesitation
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
talk
like
that
before
your
aunt
we
we
do
do
it
over
here
it
is
not
considered
nice
for
a
girl
to
talk
about
young
men
cornelia
smiled
slowly
her
beautiful
lips
curved
upwards
at
the
corner
giving
an
air
of
impish
mischief
to
her
face
she
nodded
her
head
three
times
over
and
hitched
a
shoulder
under
the
muslin
gown
she
drawled
in
her
most
pronounced
accent
if
i
got
to
think
of
i
might
as
well
talk
of
and
i
to
think
of
she
relaxed
the
grasp
of
her
knees
and
lay
back
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
chuckling
softly
in
retrospective
triumph
i
had
such
heaps
of
fun
i
just
love
to
carry
on
and
have
boys
quarrelling
over
me
and
hustling
to
get
the
first
chance
i
had
as
many
as
ten
bouquets
before
a
ball
and
i
wore
an
eleventh
which
gotten
for
myself
and
they
were
all
clean
crazed
to
find
out
who
sent
it
poppar
says
i
be
an
old
maid
yet
but
it
wo
be
for
want
of
asking
there
one
young
man
who
just
daft
about
me
he
young
and
he
lovely
and
he
got
ten
million
and
a
hef
dollars
and
to
love
him
she
sighed
despairing
i
tried
hard
but
i
elm
a
struggled
between
disapproval
curiosity
and
a
shocking
mingling
of
something
else
which
was
not
could
not
possibly
be
of
such
adventures
the
lingering
doubt
served
to
add
severity
to
her
indictment
it
very
wicked
to
flirt
once
again
cornelia
flashed
her
impish
smile
it
vurry
nice
i
do
see
a
mite
of
use
in
being
young
if
you
have
some
fun
you
grow
old
fast
enough
and
then
there
nothing
else
to
it
but
to
sit
round
and
preach
your
mother
and
aunt
soph
have
just
to
preach
but
i
would
start
yet
awhile
if
i
were
you
be
just
the
prettiest
thing
that
was
ever
seen
if
you
knew
how
to
fix
yourself
up
but
you
and
you
seem
to
me
to
mope
along
the
whole
blessed
time
without
a
bit
of
fun
to
perk
you
up
say
do
you
feel
a
bit
tired
of
it
sometimes
do
you
ever
have
a
kind
of
feeling
that
you
want
to
something
for
a
change
sometimes
do
i
ever
elma
echoed
the
words
with
startling
emphasis
always
always
it
is
here
she
pressed
her
hands
on
her
breast
stifled
up
here
all
the
time
a
horrible
rebellious
longing
to
get
out
to
be
free
to
do
i
do
know
what
really
i
do
but
something
i
lived
in
norton
all
my
life
and
hardly
ever
been
away
mother
hates
travelling
in
winter
and
in
the
summer
she
hates
to
leave
the
garden
and
i
so
strong
that
i
do
need
change
i
never
went
to
school
like
other
girls
mother
disapproves
of
school
influences
so
i
had
governesses
instead
it
awful
to
have
a
resident
teacher
in
the
house
and
be
an
only
pupil
you
feel
governessed
out
of
your
life
and
now
i
have
no
friends
to
visit
or
to
visit
me
only
the
norton
girls
for
whom
i
do
care
it
seems
ungrateful
when
i
have
so
much
to
be
thankful
for
but
i
feel
sometimes
i
get
such
a
wicked
feeling
that
i
just
long
to
snap
and
snarl
at
everybody
i
ashamed
all
the
time
and
can
how
horrid
i
am
but
she
broke
off
sighing
deeply
and
cornelia
crouched
forward
clasping
her
knees
as
before
and
bending
her
chin
to
meet
them
her
eyes
ashine
with
eagerness
and
curiosity
yes
i
know
i
been
there
myself
i
was
there
this
morning
after
just
two
weeks
i
do
begin
to
have
your
endoorance
my
dear
but
you
take
a
straight
tip
from
me
when
you
feel
the
symptoms
coming
on
do
you
go
trying
to
be
sweet
and
forbearing
and
bottling
up
all
the
froth
it
not
a
mite
of
use
for
it
bound
to
rise
to
the
top
and
keeping
do
improve
it
just
let
yourself
go
and
be
ugly
to
anyone
will
do
the
first
that
comes
handy
and
feel
a
heap
better
she
sighed
and
turned
a
roguish
glance
towards
the
shrouded
windows
of
the
nook
i
was
ugly
to
aunt
soph
before
i
came
out
already
elma
had
mastered
the
subtleties
of
americanese
sufficiently
to
understand
that
the
terms
lovely
and
ugly
had
no
bearing
on
outward
appearance
but
were
descriptive
of
character
only
her
eyes
widened
partly
in
horrified
surprise
at
listening
to
a
doctrine
so
diametrically
opposed
to
everything
which
she
had
previously
heard
and
partly
in
pure
unadulterated
curiosity
to
know
the
cause
of
the
rebellion
to
miss
briskett
oh
how
had
you
the
courage
i
should
never
have
what
was
it
about
teas
replied
cornelia
shortly
i
attended
regularly
for
the
last
ten
days
and
met
the
same
people
every
single
time
and
now
i
struck
i
had
about
enough
teas
to
last
the
rest
of
my
natural
life
but
aunt
soph
seemed
to
think
i
was
bound
to
go
wherever
i
was
asked
two
more
old
ladies
sent
invitations
i
know
at
we
got
ours
too
you
ca
refuse
cornelia
if
you
have
another
engagement
ca
i
just
you
bet
i
can
besides
what
to
hinder
having
an
engagement
if
i
want
to
say
let
fix
one
up
right
here
i
be
delighted
to
have
you
come
a
drive
with
me
to
show
me
the
country
thursday
afternoon
at
a
quarter
after
four
we
could
hire
something
i
suppose
to
drive
in
and
find
a
place
to
have
tea
on
the
way
have
a
high
old
talk
and
you
enjoy
it
a
heap
more
than
the
party
oh
i
know
that
but
i
do
know
if
i
ought
mrs
nevins
invitation
came
first
shucks
cried
cornelia
you
got
too
much
conscience
that
the
matter
with
you
you
never
have
much
of
a
time
in
this
world
if
you
do
take
the
pick
of
a
choice
what
two
hours
anyway
you
go
right
home
and
write
nice
and
pretty
to
say
you
real
sorry
got
another
engagement
your
mother
can
trot
along
with
aunt
soph
they
enjoy
themselves
a
heap
better
sitting
round
without
us
talking
over
the
perversities
of
the
young
they
were
all
tame
angels
when
they
were
girls
and
never
did
anything
they
ought
not
to
have
done
my
she
twisted
her
saucy
nose
and
rolled
her
eyes
heavenwards
thankful
i
struck
a
livelier
time
as
for
you
elma
ramsden
going
to
be
equal
to
any
one
of
them
if
nothing
happens
to
shake
you
up
i
guess
it
my
mission
to
do
the
shaking
so
we
start
fair
from
now
on
you
engaged
to
me
thursday
afternoon
understand
i
guess
we
better
go
home
and
break
the
news
before
the
answers
are
written
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
elma
followed
her
example
shaking
her
skirts
and
fastening
on
the
shady
mushroom
hat
no
further
protestations
rose
to
her
lips
so
it
might
be
taken
for
granted
that
silence
gave
consent
but
down
the
path
she
spoke
again
in
tentative
hesitating
fashion
i
do
mind
about
mrs
nevins
she
is
rich
and
strong
and
enjoys
her
life
but
miss
nesbitt
is
different
she
an
old
maid
and
poor
she
belongs
to
a
good
family
so
she
is
asked
out
with
the
rest
but
she
hardly
ever
gives
a
tea
not
once
in
a
year
it
will
be
a
great
event
to
her
she
be
beginning
to
make
preparations
even
now
baking
cakes
and
cleaning
the
silver
and
taking
off
the
covers
of
the
chairs
it
is
all
in
your
honour
she
be
disappointed
if
you
go
cornelia
turned
upon
her
with
a
flash
of
reproof
why
could
you
tell
me
that
before
i
want
to
know
pretty
mean
i
should
have
felt
backing
out
of
a
thing
like
that
i
would
disappoint
the
old
dear
for
a
fortune
is
it
the
one
with
the
flat
hair
and
the
little
ringlets
dangling
at
the
sides
they
are
too
for
anything
those
ringlets
yes
i
guessed
she
was
the
one
for
i
noticed
her
clothes
looked
all
used
up
do
you
worry
i
take
tea
with
miss
nesbitt
as
often
as
she
wants
and
behave
so
pretty
you
admire
to
see
me
that
an
olive
branch
to
carry
in
to
aunt
soph
eh
i
reckon
she
be
pretty
dusty
i
reckon
she
will
elma
glanced
with
a
smile
at
her
companion
unruffled
face
i
would
be
in
your
shoes
for
a
hundred
pounds
miss
briskett
is
formidable
enough
when
she
is
pleased
but
when
she
is
angry
cornelia
are
you
frightened
cornelia
joyous
peal
of
laughter
floated
away
on
the
air
and
caught
the
ears
of
the
industrious
morris
who
was
sweeping
the
path
a
hundred
yards
away
he
turned
to
lean
on
his
brush
and
stare
while
elma
glanced
nervously
at
the
curtained
windows
i
never
was
scared
in
my
life
that
i
know
of
and
i
not
going
to
begin
with
my
very
own
aunt
i
rather
like
a
fizzle
now
and
then
it
freshens
one
up
do
you
worry
about
me
i
quite
able
to
stand
up
for
myself
she
pushed
open
the
gate
of
the
nook
as
she
spoke
and
sauntered
up
the
path
laughing
bareheaded
radiantly
unashamed
miss
briskett
beheld
her
approach
from
her
seat
in
the
corner
of
the
and
two
spots
of
colour
shone
dully
on
her
thin
cheek
bones
the
hands
which
held
her
knitting
trembled
with
indignation
and
her
eyes
welcomed
the
culprit
with
a
steely
flash
cornelia
are
you
aware
that
you
are
forbidden
to
trespass
on
the
grass
of
this
park
yes
you
are
also
aware
i
presume
that
to
wander
alone
bareheaded
is
not
the
habit
of
young
ladies
in
this
neighbourhood
and
that
it
is
intensely
annoying
to
me
that
you
should
do
so
yes
you
know
you
are
not
ashamed
to
acknowledge
it
then
may
i
inquire
why
you
have
deliberately
chosen
to
do
what
you
know
to
be
wrong
cornelia
drew
up
a
comfortable
chair
and
seated
herself
by
her
side
arranging
her
draperies
with
a
succession
of
little
pulls
and
pats
she
rested
one
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
leant
her
chin
upon
the
upraised
palm
a
pretty
pose
into
which
she
fell
naturally
in
leisure
moments
the
cat
blinked
at
her
through
sleepy
eyelids
then
deliberately
ignoring
the
devotion
of
years
rose
from
its
place
by
its
mistress
side
stretched
itself
with
feline
grace
and
stalked
majestically
across
the
rug
to
nestle
against
the
soft
white
skirts
miss
briskett
eyed
its
desertion
over
the
brim
of
her
spectacles
poor
lady
her
measure
of
love
received
was
so
small
that
she
felt
a
distinct
pang
at
the
defection
what
explanation
have
you
to
offer
cornelia
you
knew
that
you
would
annoy
me
why
yes
of
course
that
all
there
was
to
it
it
did
thrill
me
a
mite
to
walk
over
a
strip
of
lawn
without
figging
up
in
my
best
duds
i
can
do
that
any
day
i
want
at
home
but
i
just
to
raise
cain
somehow
it
the
only
way
i
ken
pull
round
again
when
i
get
mad
i
just
go
right
away
and
do
the
ugliest
thing
i
can
strike
and
then
i
feel
all
soothed
and
calmed
down
you
try
it
yourself
next
time
it
beats
knitting
stockings
all
into
fits
i
just
as
sweet
as
candy
now
so
you
got
to
forgive
me
and
be
friends
i
sorry
i
acted
so
mean
but
you
were
pretty
nippy
yourself
were
you
now
i
guess
we
both
been
used
to
take
our
own
way
without
any
fluster
and
it
comes
pretty
hard
to
be
crossed
but
now
we
had
our
fling
we
got
to
kiss
and
make
friends
that
so
is
it
she
bent
forward
pouting
her
lips
to
receive
the
token
of
peace
but
miss
briskett
drew
back
in
chilly
dignity
for
the
past
hour
she
had
nourished
a
smouldering
resentment
feeling
herself
the
most
of
womenkind
and
this
calm
inclusion
of
herself
in
the
list
of
did
not
tend
to
pour
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
for
cornelia
to
acknowledge
her
deliberate
intention
to
offend
and
in
the
same
breath
to
offer
a
kiss
of
reconciliation
showed
a
reprehensible
lack
of
proper
feeling
miss
briskett
was
a
woman
of
high
principles
and
made
a
point
of
forgiving
her
enemies
slowly
as
a
preliminary
process
she
demanded
an
abject
apology
and
a
period
of
waiting
during
which
the
culprit
was
expected
to
be
devoured
by
remorse
and
anxiety
then
bending
from
an
impeccable
height
she
vouchsafed
a
mitigated
pardon
i
forgive
you
but
i
can
never
forget
some
such
absolution
she
would
have
been
ready
to
bestow
upon
a
tearful
and
dejected
cornelia
but
the
pink
and
white
complaisance
of
the
uplifted
face
steeled
her
heart
afresh
she
shrank
back
in
her
chair
ignoring
the
outstretched
hand
excuse
me
my
dear
but
i
do
not
care
to
kiss
a
person
who
has
just
acknowledged
that
she
has
deliberately
tried
to
annoy
me
i
was
naturally
displeased
at
your
rejection
of
my
friend
hospitality
but
it
is
exceedingly
impertinent
to
compare
my
behaviour
to
your
own
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
your
hostess
and
nearly
three
times
your
age
then
you
ought
to
be
three
times
better
ought
you
retorted
cornelia
blandly
well
i
own
up
that
i
sorry
about
miss
nesbitt
and
i
be
pleased
to
take
tea
with
her
as
often
as
she
likes
but
i
regret
that
a
previous
engagement
prevents
my
going
thursday
also
you
tell
the
old
lady
from
me
that
i
real
sorry
to
miss
the
treat
and
if
it
will
ease
her
mind
any
to
know
that
i
do
think
england
a
patch
on
america
she
welcome
to
the
information
elma
ramsden
and
i
have
fixed
up
a
drive
to
see
the
country
thursday
afternoon
miss
briskett
clinked
irritably
together
a
half
concession
was
little
better
than
none
and
the
frivolous
tone
of
cornelia
remarks
spoke
of
something
far
removed
from
the
ideal
repentance
apart
from
the
question
of
the
she
disapproved
of
two
young
girls
driving
about
the
country
unattended
but
her
courage
shrank
from
the
thought
of
another
battle
she
dropped
her
eyelids
and
replied
icily
as
you
have
already
made
your
arrangements
it
is
useless
for
me
to
offer
any
objections
you
are
evidently
determined
to
take
your
own
way
in
spite
of
anything
i
can
say
i
can
only
trust
that
no
harm
may
come
of
the
experiment
chapter
seven
on
thursday
afternoon
at
three
cornelia
retired
to
her
bedroom
and
with
the
help
of
the
devoted
mary
proceeded
to
make
an
elaborate
toilette
for
the
drive
those
wonderful
trunks
seemed
to
contain
garments
suitable
for
every
possible
occasion
which
could
arise
for
every
fluctuation
of
weather
for
every
degree
of
festivity
from
one
of
the
number
out
came
a
long
driving
coat
snowy
white
light
of
texture
an
ideal
garment
for
a
warm
yet
dusty
summer
day
which
being
fastened
down
the
side
by
huge
pearl
buttons
displayed
a
degree
of
smartness
nothing
short
of
uncanny
in
an
untrimmed
garment
to
wear
with
the
coat
there
was
a
jaunty
cap
and
a
pair
of
driving
gloves
with
wide
gauntleted
cuffs
cornelia
made
faces
at
herself
in
the
glass
as
her
custom
was
the
while
she
arranged
the
set
of
her
hat
puffed
out
her
shaded
locks
and
affably
her
attendant
on
her
private
affairs
mury
how
your
friend
he
is
so
well
as
he
was
miss
thank
you
all
the
same
he
been
a
bit
upset
in
his
indigestion
think
of
that
now
is
that
sad
you
buy
him
a
bottle
of
physic
and
send
it
along
i
pay
it
not
a
mite
of
use
having
a
friend
with
indigestion
he
be
just
as
doleful
and
you
want
him
to
give
you
a
real
good
time
how
your
mother
getting
along
nicely
thank
you
miss
she
said
she
did
know
how
to
thank
you
enough
for
the
shawl
her
poor
old
bones
have
ached
half
so
much
since
she
had
it
to
hap
round
her
of
a
night
is
that
sweet
hustle
up
now
with
my
high
shoes
and
do
mind
buttoning
in
bits
of
flesh
as
you
did
last
time

just
as
lief
be
left
out
see
here
mury
i
want
everything

back
in
its
place
after

hate
to
find
a
muss
when
i
get
back
and
that
blue
muslin
has
got
to
be
pressed
out
for
and
those
bits
of
lace
washed
and
the
parcels
changed
at
the
shop
mind
it
got
to
be
all
done
by
the
time
i
am
back
and

here
next
time

go
out
to
meet
your
friend
there
that
taffetas
waist
you
can
have
for
yourself
look
dandy
in
it
and
he
be
so
proud
maybe
it
will
help
the
indigestion
better
than
physic
mary
was
incoherent
with
delight
and
promised
ardently
to
execute
all
the
young
lady
orders
knowing
full
well
that
it
was
the
silver
afternoon
and
that
her
time
should
of
rights
be
fully
occupied
with
household
duties
she
promised
and
she
intended
to
perform
by
dint
of
smiles
pleasant
words
kindly
interests
in
friends
and
ceaseless
doles
of
finery
and
physic
cornelia
had
established
such
a
hold
upon
the
affections
of
the
staff
that
her
wish
already
took
precedent
of
her
aunt
law
mary
mentally
condemned
half
the
contents
of
the
silver
cupboard
to
neglect
the
while
she
ironed
out
foaming
frills
and
floating
sash
ends
mrs
ramsden
accompanied
elma
to
the
gate
of
the
nook
and
stood
beside
miss
briskett
looking
on
with
dubious
eyes
while
the
two
girls
took
their
places
in
the
high
a
groom
had
driven
the
horse
from
the
livery
stable
and
both
good
ladies
expected
him
to
take
possession
of
the
back
seat
in
the
double
capacity
of
chaperon
and
guide
it
came
therefore
as
a
shock
when
cornelia
dismissed
the
man
with
a
smile
and
a
rain
of
silver
dropped
into
an
eager
hand
but
protestations
feeble
and
stern
were
alike
disregarded
how
do
you
suppose
we
are
going
to
talk
with
him
perched
there
with
his
ears
sticking
out
listening
to
every
word
we
say
we
do
want
any
men
poking
round
this
journey
laughed
cornelia
settling
herself
in
her
seat
and
taking
the
reins
in
her
gauntleted
hands
miss
briskett
was
dismayed
to
feel
a
thrill
of
pride
mingling
with
her
displeasure
for
the
girl
looked
so
fresh
so
trim
so
sparklingly
alive
perched
up
on
her
high
driving
seat
elma
ramsden
for
all
her
superior
beauty
looked
tame
and
insignificant
beside
her
although
she
would
not
condescend
to
look
around
miss
briskett
divined
that
behind
the
curtains
of
the
neighbouring
houses
the
occupants
were
looking
on
with
admiring
curiosity
and
noting
every
detail
of
the
girl
attire
if
cornelia
were
and
defiant
in
appearance
at
least
she
was
a
worthy
representative
of
her
race
the
stern
lines
of
the
mouth
relaxed
into
an
unwilling
smile
as
she
said
urgently
but
my
dear
the
horse
i
am
responsible
for
your
safety
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
are
capable
of
managing
him
cornelia
ripple
of
amusement
was
sufficiently
expressive
one
old
mare
in
a
hired
trap
when
i
driven
a
over
some
of
the
wickedest
roads
in
america
if
we
are
smashed
aunt
soph
you
can
lay
it
to
providence
and
not
to
my
driving
do
get
to
worrying
if
we
are
late
if
we
killed
you
hear
all
about
it
soon
enough
you
can
only
die
once
and
a
carriage
spill
is
a
good
slick
way
of
getting
it
over
cornelia
i
insist
miss
cornelia
i
beg
the
cart
dashed
suddenly
onward
in
response
to
a
flip
of
the
whip
leaving
the
two
old
ladies
upon
the
roadway
the
unfinished
appeal
frozen
upon
their
lips
elma
turned
round
to
wave
an
abashed
adieu
the
long
habit
of
servitude
struggling
with
a
delicious
new
sense
of
liberty
and
adventure
oh
oh
cornelia
if
you
could
only
them
they
are
standing
staring
after
us
they
look
petrified
it
naughty
of
you
you
frightened
your
aunt
on
purpose
that
so
assented
cornelia
frankly
i
meant
to
do
it
it
going
to
hurt
me
a
lot
more
than
it
does
her
as
the
mommar
said
when
she
spanked
the
nipper
but
she
got
just
as
set
as
a
fossil
paddling
along
in
this
little
backwater
and
imagining
it
the
whole
big
ocean
and
there
no
one
on
hand
to
rouse
her
but
myself
it
my
mission
wake
up
england
and
she
flourished
her
whip
dramatically
as
the
mare
trotted
through
the
south
gateway
of
the
park
outside
the
gate
lay
a
smooth
wide
road
stretching
uphill
and
in
response
to
a
movement
of
elma
outstretched
hand
cornelia
turned
the
mare
in
this
direction
flashing
a
radiant
smile
into
the
face
well
well
what
how
do
you
feel
excited
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
cornelia
nodded
sagely
perhaps
it
is
there
no
saying
i
seen
horses
i
sooner
trust
in
a
scrimmage
but
a
little
spill
would
do
you
no
harm
you
skeery
as
a
cat
you
want
nerve
my
dear
nerve
cornelia
flicked
her
whip
round
the
horse
ears
to
give
emphasis
to
her
words
and
chuckled
with
mischievous
amusement
as
elma
clutched
the
seat
and
gasped
in
dismay
i
call
this
crawling
not
driving
when
we
get
out
into
the
real
country
i
make
her
go
so
we
get
some
fresh
air
into
our
lungs
then
you
can
hold
on
if
you
like
but
do
pay
before
the
show
begins
now
then
where
are
we
bound
elma
cast
down
her
eyes
faintly
blushing
beneath
her
hat
surely
there
was
something
infectiously
electric
in
the
air
this
afternoon
or
why
should
her
thoughts
fly
as
an
arrow
from
the
bow
to
just
that
very
spot
which
it
should
have
been
her
maidenly
duty
to
avoid
she
blushed
at
her
own
audacity
telling
herself
sternly
that
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
held
the
temptation
afar
off
looking
at
it
longing
after
it
regretfully
deciding
to
cast
it
aside
then
with
a
sudden
impetuous
change
of
front
hugged
it
to
her
breast
yes
she
would
for
one
afternoon
one
golden
glorious
afternoon
she
would
send
prudence
to
the
winds
and
follow
her
own
instincts
after
all
why
not
because
a
certain
person
happened
to
be
squire
of
a
certain
district
it
did
not
follow
that
other
people
could
not
drive
over
his
land
without
being
suspected
of
personal
designs
it
was
to
the
last
degree
unlikely
that
one
would
happen
to
meet
anyone
one
knew
but
if
one
elma
acknowledged
to
herself
that
a
lift
of
the
hat
a
glance
of
pleased
recognition
would
remain
in
memory
as
the
pleasantest
episode
of
the
afternoon
as
a
palliative
to
her
conscience
elma
suggested
a
farther
village
as
the
termination
to
the
drive
directing
the
course
with
a
thrill
of
guilty
triumph
at
each
fresh
turning
ai
this
dandy
cried
cornelia
preening
her
little
head
and
showing
her
white
teeth
in
a
smile
of
delight
this
england
of
yours
is
just
a
little
garden
with
the
roads
rolled
out
like
gravel
paths
you
stare
to
see
the
roads
about
my
home
over
here
it
all
grass
and
roses
you
are
a
rose
too
a
real
sweet
garden
rose
with
the
dewdrops
on
its
leaves
if
i
were
an
artist
i
paint
a
picture
of
you
on
one
panel
and
aunt
soph
on
the
other
as
two
types
of
english
life
and
the
people
could
look
on
and
learn
a
lesson
it
kinder
sweet
and
touching
to
dream
along
so
long
as
you
young
but
if
you
go
on
keeping
your
eyes
shut
it
do
pan
out
well
in
old
age
it
best
to
have
wide
open
and
realise
that
there
are
two
or
three
more
people
in
the
world
beside
yourself
elma
smiled
in
vague
preoccupied
fashion
her
own
thoughts
were
all
engrossing
and
at
every
fresh
winding
of
the
road
she
held
her
breath
in
suspense
while
the
wild
rose
colour
deepened
in
her
cheeks
suppose
suppose
they
met
him
how
would
he
look
what
would
he
do
what
would
he
think
even
the
compliment
to
herself
faded
into
insignificance
beside
such
questions
as
these
the
mare
was
trotting
briskly
along
a
high
level
road
on
the
right
side
of
which
lay
the
boundary
wall
of
a
large
estate
estate
every
inch
of
which
was
thrilling
with
interest
to
one
onlooker
at
least
to
the
right
a
bank
of
grass
sloped
gradually
to
a
lower
road
beneath
which
again
could
be
seen
a
panorama
of
country
cornelia
slackened
the
reins
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
moment
up
to
now
decorous
toddles
to
and
fro
the
outlying
villas
had
been
her
only
form
of
exercise
and
she
was
amazed
and
delighted
with
the
verdant
beauty
of
the
scene
as
elma
did
not
seem
inclined
for
conversation
she
made
no
further
remark
and
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
the
two
girls
drove
onward
in
silence
each
happy
in
her
own
thoughts
in
the
sunshine
in
the
sweet
balmy
air
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
the
flowering
trees
then
of
a
sudden
one
of
the
lodges
of
the
park
came
into
view
and
on
the
roadside
beside
the
door
a
dazzling
golden
object
at
sight
of
which
cornelia
puckered
puzzled
brows
what
in
the
land
name
is
that
the
sun
dazzles
so
that
i
ca
see
it
a
a
cage
i
think
i
see
something
like
bars
what
are
they
up
to
then
putting
a
gilt
cage
on
the
high
road
in
the
blazing
sunshine
they
might
use
the
sense
they
were
born
with
steady
old
lady
steady
cried
cornelia
soothingly
as
the
mare
pricked
up
her
ears
and
shied
uneasily
to
the
farther
side
of
the
road
yes
it
a
cage
right
enough
and
a
poll
parrot
inside
guess
i
pull
up
at
that
house
and
tell
the
inmates
that
it
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
blazing
firework
on
the
side
of
the
path
enough
to
scare
any
horse
in
creation
this
old
lady
is
as
nervous
as
a
cat
the
fact
was
painfully
apparent
even
to
elma
inexperience
for
the
mare
refusing
to
be
soothed
by
cornelia
cajoling
words
and
chuckles
shied
still
nearer
the
opposite
hedge
her
ears
cocked
nervously
erect
seen
nearer
at
hand
and
out
of
the
direct
dazzle
of
sunlight
the
cage
looked
innocent
enough
with
its
grey
inmate
swinging
solemnly
to
and
fro
on
its
perch
but
as
the
cart
swung
rapidly
past
mistress
poll
evidently
felt
that
it
was
time
to
assert
herself
and
opened
her
mouth
to
emit
a
shrill
raucous
cry
at
the
sound
of
which
the
mare
bounded
forward
in
a
headlong
gallop
i
knew
it
cried
cornelia
shortly
i
just
guessed
that
had
to
come
next
she
sat
bolt
upright
twisting
the
reins
round
her
fingers
her
lips
pressed
into
a
thin
red
line
her
eyes
ashine
with
an
excitement
in
which
was
more
than
a
spice
of
enjoyment
she
shook
herself
impatiently
free
from
elma
frenzied
grasp
now
then
none
of
that
you
leave
my
arms
alone
i
need
all
my
strength
before
we
through
with
this
trouble
my
stars
and
stripes
how
she
does
pull
oh
oh
cornelia
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
shall
we
be
thrown
what
going
to
happen
not
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch
did
cornelia
turn
her
head
in
answer
to
this
frenzied
appeal
upright
as
a
dart
she
sat
in
her
seat
her
slender
wrists
straining
at
the
reins
do
yelp
she
said
shortly
keep
that
till
you
hurt
say
what
happens
to
the
road
after
the
next
turn
i
do
know
oh
what
shall
we
do
why
did
we
ever
come
cornelia
can
you
hold
her
back
no
snapped
cornelia
shortly
i
ca
not
for
many
minutes
longer
at
this
rate
my
wrists
are
about
broken
as
it
is
what
happens
after
this
turning
i
say
you
must
know
use
your
brains
for
goodness
sake
if
you
want
any
left
to
use
another
day
is
it
a
good
road
better
than
this
what
on
the
sides
hedgerows
walls
water
for
the
land
sake
child
sort
your
ideas
thus
admonished
elma
made
a
violent
effort
to
pull
herself
together
for
reasons
already
mentioned
this
particular
bit
of
country
was
clearly
imprinted
on
her
memory
and
she
had
but
to
collect
her
scattered
wits
to
see
a
clear
picture
of
the
path
ahead
the
road
is
quite
good
there
is
a
wall
two
walls
some
farm
buildings
on
the
right
at
the
end
there
is
a
hill
it
leads
down
into
the
next
village
humph
cornelia
nostrils
dilated
widely
and
two
spots
of
pink
showed
on
her
white
cheeks
then
i
guess
this
is
the
end
of
the
volume
a
grass
bank
is
better
than
a
wall
any
day
of
the
week
now
then
young
woman
if
you
got
any
grit
stowed
away
get
it
out
and
use
it
are
you
ready
no
no
shrieked
elma
wildly
she
clutched
the
seat
with
despairing
hands
as
with
a
sudden
convulsive
movement
cornelia
switched
the
mare
violently
to
the
right
help
help
oh
help
the
bank
rose
before
her
eyes
in
a
sudden
mountainous
sweep
the
mare
instead
of
being
in
front
soared
suddenly
on
the
top
of
the
trap
the
hinges
creaked
and
strained
and
the
seat
assumed
a
perpendicular
position
it
was
all
over
in
a
couple
of
minutes
but
to
elma
it
seemed
as
many
hours
she
had
time
to
hear
the
rush
of
approaching
footsteps
to
see
over
the
top
of
the
hedge
three
startled
masculine
faces
to
recognise
the
nearer
of
the
three
with
a
great
throb
of
relief
and
to
stretch
out
her
arms
towards
him
with
a
shrill
cry
of
appeal
then
the
crash
came
and
she
was
shot
headlong
into
space
fireworks
that
was
the
first
impression
little
dots
of
flame
flitting
about
before
her
eyes
forming
into
circles
of
light
and
whizzing
rapidly
round
and
round
then
when
her
eyes
were
open
a
heavy
confused
stupor
in
which
she
saw
but
refused
to
understand
why
was
she
lying
on
the
grass
in
the
middle
of
the
day
why
did
cornelia
look
so
queer
with
her
face
stained
with
soil
and
her
hat
on
one
side
why
did
they
offer
her
things
to
drink
she
was
thirsty
the
tea
was
bad
it
stung
her
mouth
it
was
tea
at
all
but
something
hot
and
nasty
it
was
brandy
out
of
a
flask
elma
lifted
big
lovely
eyes
of
a
pansy
blue
and
stared
vacantly
into
the
face
by
her
side
but
at
the
sight
of
it
memory
came
back
in
a
rush
she
sat
up
stiffly
moving
her
limbs
in
nervous
tentative
fashion
gasped
sighed
and
quavered
out
a
tremulous
what
happened
is
it
all
over
are
we
saved
cornelia
loomed
above
her
alert
even
in
this
moment
of
shock
and
dishevelment
one
cheek
was
plastered
with
soil
patches
of
green
stain
discoloured
her
coat
her
hair
hung
rakishly
askew
yet
never
had
her
manner
been
more
composed
nor
complacently
matter
of
fact
we
had
a
pretty
lucky
you
are
alive
all
right
and
i
guess
there
not
much
the
matter
with
you
but
nerves
there
nothing
wrong
with
your
lungs
anyway
you
scared
the
mare
pretty
near
as
much
as
the
bird
yelping
like
a
crazed
thing
and
hanging
on
to
my
arm
the
grass
is
soft
enough
it
has
hurt
you
any
you
need
worry
feeling
all
over
to
see
if
there
a
break
you
know
it
fast
enough
if
there
were
miss
ramsden
is
feeling
stunned
i
think
it
would
be
wiser
to
allow
her
to
recover
gradually
it
is
a
shock
to
er
to
most
systems
to
be
shot
out
of
a
cart
however
short
the
distance
the
masculine
voice
was
thunderous
with
indignation
and
the
arm
which
supported
elma
back
tightened
its
hold
as
if
to
protect
her
against
the
world
cornelia
turned
aside
her
red
lips
twisted
into
a
smile
and
walked
along
the
bank
to
where
the
other
two
men
were
unharnessing
the
mare
which
lay
on
her
side
trembling
with
fright
the
blood
oozing
from
several
cuts
and
scratches
as
cornelia
walked
she
held
her
right
wrist
tightly
with
her
left
hand
as
if
she
still
felt
the
strain
of
that
wrestle
with
the
reins
but
there
was
no
flinching
in
voice
or
manner
as
she
stood
over
the
men
issuing
instructions
in
brisk
incisive
tones
the
nearer
of
the
two
was
impressed
to
the
extent
of
ceasing
work
to
touch
his
cap
the
second
darted
one
contemptuous
glance
in
her
direction
and
placidly
continued
to
disobey
cornelia
promptly
knelt
on
the
grass
by
his
side
with
intent
to
demonstrate
her
own
greater
efficiency
but
the
first
movement
of
the
strained
wrist
brought
a
flush
of
pain
to
her
cheeks
she
sat
back
pursing
her
lips
together
to
restrain
an
involuntary
groan
while
the
stranger
flashed
a
second
look
in
her
direction
he
was
a
tall
lean
somewhat
cadaverous
looking
man
with
eyes
shaded
by
haughty
eyelids
perpetually
adroop
as
though
no
object
on
earth
were
worthy
of
his
regard
cornelia
took
him
in
in
a
swift
comprehensive
glance
and
with
youthful
ardour
decided
that
she
loathed
the
creature
hurt
yourself
not
a
bit
thanks
i
guess
there
enough
of
you
to
do
the
work
without
me
but
i
used
to
seeing
things
done
in
a
hurry
and
you
seemed
pretty
deliberate
a
little
caution
is
not
thrown
away
sometimes
what
induced
you
to
come
out
driving
alone
if
you
could
not
manage
a
horse
there
being
no
reply
to
this
question
and
the
last
buckle
of
the
harness
being
unstrapped
the
speaker
turned
an
inquiring
glance
over
his
shoulder
to
behold
a
rigid
figure
and
a
face
ablaze
with
indignation
there
was
something
in
the
girl
face
at
that
moment
so
vital
so
bizarre
and
arresting
that
so
long
as
rupert
guest
lived
it
remained
with
him
as
one
of
the
most
striking
pictures
in
his
mental
gallery
he
had
but
to
pass
a
high
green
hedge
in
the
june
sunshine
to
catch
the
fragrance
of
the
honeysuckle
and
roses
and
it
rose
up
before
him
again
the
white
furious
face
with
the
red
roughened
locks
and
the
gleam
of
white
teeth
through
the
scarlet
lips
there
was
no
admiration
in
his
thoughts
this
was
not
at
all
the
type
of
girl
whom
he
admired
but
she
was
a
being
by
herself
different
from
anyone
whom
he
had
met
he
stared
at
her
with
curious
attention
do
you
mean
said
cornelia
in
the
slow
even
tones
of
intense
anger
that
you
think
this
was
my
doing
that
i
upset
the
cart
by
my
bad
driving
if
that
so
you
are
a
little
out
in
your
reckoning
if
i
had
been
used
to
horses
all
my
days
we
might
have
been
in
kingdom
come
by
this
time
i
her
into
the
bank
before
worse
things
happened
then
what
sent
her
off
in
the
first
instance
a
poll
parrot
screeching
in
its
cage
set
right
out
in
the
roadway
by
some
fool
owner
who
ought
to
be
had
up
for
murder
the
stranger
pursed
up
his
lips
in
an
expressive
whistle
then
suddenly
sprang
upwards
as
the
mare
freed
from
her
harness
rolled
on
her
side
and
struggled
to
her
feet
where
she
stood
shivering
and
tossing
her
head
displaying
fresh
cuts
and
bruises
in
her
dusty
coat
the
labourer
put
his
hand
on
her
neck
soothing
her
with
gentle
words
and
touches
while
his
master
surveyed
her
with
kindly
concern
poor
brute
better
take
her
to
the
stables
james
and
send
off
for
a
vet
mrs
greville
can
no
doubt
spare
a
carriage
to
take
these
ladies
home
he
turned
towards
cornelia
with
an
impulse
of
provocation
which
seemed
to
spring
from
some
source
outside
himself
as
a
rule
he
was
chivalrous
where
women
were
concerned
but
there
was
something
in
the
personality
of
this
girl
which
aroused
his
antagonism
it
seemed
almost
a
personal
offence
that
she
should
be
so
alert
and
composed
while
the
mare
bled
and
trembled
and
that
pale
lovely
thing
lay
like
a
broken
snowdrop
on
the
bank
he
felt
a
growing
desire
to
annoy
to
wound
to
break
down
this
armour
of
complacent
vanity
so
you
could
not
hold
her
till
she
tired
herself
out
well
the
experiment
seems
to
have
answered
less
successfully
from
her
point
of
view
than
your
own
she
need
a
considerable
time
to
recover
her
nerves
and
give
these
scratches
time
to
heal
skin
deep
sneered
cornelia
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
i
drive
her
back
in
a
day
or
two
and
up
and
down
this
road
until
she
learns
not
to
play
that
trick
again
i
never
given
in
to
a
horse
yet
and
i
not
going
to
begin
with
a
hack
mare
the
stranger
eyed
her
with
cold
disapproval
perhaps
her
owner
may
refuse
to
allow
her
to
be
experimented
upon
again
i
should
in
his
place
it
may
be
foolish
but
i
hate
to
see
a
brute
suffer
even
for
the
noble
purpose
of
proving
my
own
superiority
he
swung
away
as
he
spoke
thus
failing
to
see
the
stunned
blankness
of
cornelia
expression
straight
as
a
dart
she
stood
with
head
thrown
back
scarlet
lips
pressed
tightly
together
and
dark
brows
knitted
above
the
wounded
tragedy
of
her
eyes
the
labourer
standing
by
the
mare
side
looked
towards
her
with
honest
sympathy
he
had
had
personal
experience
of
the
length
of
the
captain
tongue
and
was
correspondingly
sympathetic
towards
another
sufferer
a
tender
of
dumb
animals
he
was
quick
to
understand
the
expression
on
the
girl
face
and
to
know
that
she
had
been
wrongfully
accused
do
you
take
on
miss
he
said
touching
his
cap
with
the
unashamed
servility
at
which
the
american
girl
never
ceased
to
wonder
i
look
after
her
meself
and
if
the
dirt
is
washed
out
of
the
sores
at
once
she
come
to
no
harm
likely
as
not
there
be
nothing
for
the
vet
to
do
by
the
time
he
arrives
at
the
worst
it
be
only
a
few
stitches
she
soon
get
over
that
cornelia
shivered
and
bit
hard
on
her
lower
lip
she
slipped
her
hand
into
an
inside
pocket
of
the
white
coat
and
coming
a
step
nearer
dropped
a
coin
into
the
man
hand
he
cast
down
his
eyes
started
and
flushed
a
deep
red
thank
you
miss
beg
pardon
but
you
made
a
mistake
a
sovereign
lay
brightly
on
his
grimy
palm
he
stared
at
it
with
respectful
awe
scarcely
regretful
since
it
did
not
enter
his
mind
to
conceive
that
such
a
munificent
gift
could
seriously
have
been
offered
for
his
acceptance
it
had
seldom
happened
that
he
had
had
the
handling
of
such
a
fortune
since
his
whole
weekly
earnings
reached
a
total
of
eighteen
shillings
but
cornelia
in
her
turn
looked
abashed
and
discomfited
thrusting
her
hand
once
again
into
the
little
pocket
i
sorry
i
ke
get
used
to
your
money
over
here
will
that
make
it
enough
to
the
man
utter
stupefaction
she
placed
a
second
sovereign
beside
the
first
in
his
outstretched
palm
he
stared
at
it
with
distended
eyes
thrilled
by
the
discovery
that
she
meant
it
after
all
awed
by
the
revelation
of
such
munificence
beg
pardon
miss
i
was
thinking
as
you
mistook
it
for
a
shilling
not
making
so
bold
as
to
complain
i
thank
your
ladyship
kindly
sure
i
ca
rightly
say
what
i
ought
he
stuttered
incoherent
with
excitement
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
held
out
the
second
sovereign
and
cornelia
understood
that
his
good
feeling
permitted
him
to
accept
only
what
had
been
originally
offered
she
would
have
felt
the
same
in
his
place
and
realising
as
much
took
back
the
coin
without
a
demur
well
it
waiting
for
you
next
time
i
come
if
you
done
your
duty
by
that
mare
she
turned
and
walked
slowly
back
to
where
the
two
men
were
standing
talking
together
some
eight
or
ten
yards
away
their
backs
were
turned
towards
her
and
her
assailant
of
a
few
minutes
past
was
evidently
answering
an
appeal
from
his
friend
she
caught
the
last
words
as
she
drew
near
i
will
go
to
the
stable
and
look
after
the
mare
you
can
take
them
up
to
the
house
without
my
help
i
ca
stand
any
more
of
that
girl
he
wheeled
round
as
he
spoke
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
cornelia
they
stared
each
other
full
in
the
eyes
like
two
combatants
measuring
strength
before
a
battle
chapter
eight
to
elma
it
was
still
a
dream
but
a
dream
growing
momentarily
more
wonderful
and
thrilling
the
stupor
in
her
head
was
passing
away
and
there
was
nothing
painful
in
the
lassitude
which
remained
she
was
just
weak
and
languid
content
to
lie
still
in
the
sunshine
her
head
resting
on
one
of
the
cushions
from
the
overturned
cart
her
eyes
turning
instinctively
to
the
bronzed
face
which
bent
over
her
with
such
tender
solicitude
as
for
geoffrey
greville
he
was
realising
with
a
curious
mingling
of
dismay
and
elation
that
the
moment
was
fated
to
be
historic
in
the
story
of
his
life
for
the
last
two
years
he
had
been
haunted
by
the
vision
of
elma
ramsden
face
at
odd
but
by
no
means
inconsequent
moments
when
for
instance
his
mother
expatiated
on
the
duty
of
marriage
for
a
man
in
his
position
and
extolled
the
fascinations
of
certain
youthful
members
of
county
society
when
he
walked
down
the
long
and
regarded
the
space
on
the
wall
where
his
portrait
might
some
day
hang
beside
his
own
when
he
sat
at
the
head
of
his
table
and
looked
across
at
the
opposite
space
why
was
it
that
in
such
moments
as
these
the
face
of
this
one
girl
flashed
forward
and
persistently
blocked
the
way
elma
ramsden
just
a
little
insignificant
girl
whom
he
had
met
at
half
a
dozen
garden
parties
and
at
homes
she
did
not
even
belong
to
the
county
set
but
was
the
daughter
of
a
funny
dumpy
little
mother
who
disapproved
on
principle
of
everything
smart
and
himself
emphatically
included
the
good
lady
evidently
regarded
him
as
a
wicked
creature
whose
society
was
fraught
with
danger
to
her
tender
bantling
he
had
seen
her
clucking
with
agitation
as
he
had
sat
with
elma
beneath
the
trees
mrs
greville
had
a
calling
acquaintance
with
the
park
ladies
and
occasionally
referred
with
a
blighting
toleration
to
goody
ramsden
but
she
never
by
any
chance
mentioned
mrs
ramsden
daughter
geoffrey
was
doubtful
whether
she
realised
the
fact
of
elma
existence
up
till
now
he
himself
had
drifted
along
in
the
manner
of
bachelors
approaching
their
thirtieth
birthday
before
the
crucial
moment
arrives
which
acts
as
a
spark
to
smouldering
flames
he
had
indulged
in
lazy
in
which
elma
played
the
part
of
heroine
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
society
when
fate
placed
her
in
his
way
without
however
exerting
himself
to
take
any
active
steps
to
secure
additional
meetings
this
afternoon
as
he
walked
across
the
meadow
with
his
friend
he
would
have
indignantly
denied
the
accusation
that
he
was
in
love
but
the
historic
moment
was
at
hand
a
cry
for
help
rang
in
his
ears
above
the
hedge
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
white
frenzied
face
and
saw
two
hands
held
out
towards
him
in
appeal
the
anguished
grip
of
the
heart
with
which
he
realised
at
once
identity
and
her
peril
was
a
revelation
of
his
own
feelings
which
could
not
be
reasoned
away
as
he
knelt
by
her
side
in
those
first
anxious
moments
he
was
perhaps
almost
as
much
stunned
as
herself
for
in
the
flash
of
an
eye
his
whole
life
had
altered
where
he
had
doubted
he
was
now
convinced
where
he
had
frivoled
he
was
in
deep
intense
earnest
the
fact
that
there
would
be
certain
difficulties
to
overcome
only
seemed
to
strengthen
the
inward
determination
if
elma
would
accept
him
she
should
be
his
wife
though
the
whole
world
were
against
them
and
elma
lay
and
looked
at
him
with
her
dazed
lovely
eyes
allowing
him
to
arrange
the
cushions
under
her
head
with
a
simple
acquiescence
which
seemed
to
him
the
sweetest
thing
in
the
world
now
that
the
first
dread
was
relieved
he
felt
a
guilty
satisfaction
in
the
knowledge
of
her
prostration
and
of
the
damage
done
to
horse
and
cart
it
was
impossible
that
she
could
drive
back
to
norton
without
some
hours
rest
and
a
special
providence
seemed
to
have
arranged
that
the
accident
should
take
place
close
to
his
own
gates
he
was
too
much
engrossed
in
his
own
interests
to
notice
the
look
which
was
exchanged
between
his
friend
and
cornelia
and
as
the
captain
turned
away
discomfited
geoffrey
eagerly
addressing
his
remarks
to
the
girl
herself
i
want
to
get
miss
ramsden
up
to
the
house
she
must
rest
and
be
looked
after
and
my
mother
will
be
delighted
i
mean
she
be
awfully
distressed
if
you
did
come
it
not
far
only
a
few
hundred
yards
up
the
avenue
i
could
carry
her
easily
if
she
ca
manage
to
walk
but
at
that
elma
sat
up
a
spot
of
colour
shining
on
her
white
cheeks
ah
but
i
can
i
better
i
really
quite
well
but
it
giving
so
much
trouble
i
could
wait
in
the
lodge
indeed
you
could
i
would
allow
it
there
no
accommodation
there
and
the
children
would
annoy
you
take
my
arm
and
lean
on
me
miss
er
your
friend
will
support
you
on
the
other
side
briskett
volunteered
cornelia
bowing
towards
him
in
gracious
acknowledgment
now
then
elma
up
with
you
guess
you
about
sick
of
that
bank
by
this
time
there
nothing
to
it
but
nerves
and
that
wo
prevent
you
walking
with
a
prospect
of
tea
ahead
you
not
half
as
bad
as
you
think
you
are
elma
thought
she
was
a
good
deal
worse
the
sudden
rise
to
her
feet
drawn
by
two
strong
hands
brought
with
it
a
return
of
the
faintness
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
geoffrey
would
have
to
carry
out
his
first
proposition
she
struggled
bravely
however
and
cornelia
forcibly
ducked
her
head
forward
a
sensible
though
on
the
face
of
it
rather
a
callous
remedy
of
which
geoffrey
plainly
disapproved
he
drew
the
little
hand
through
his
arm
pressing
it
close
to
his
side
and
thus
linked
together
the
three
made
their
way
to
the
and
up
the
winding
avenue
as
they
went
cornelia
kept
casting
quick
scrutinising
glances
at
her
companions
her
brain
busily
at
work
trying
to
place
this
stranger
whose
name
had
never
been
mentioned
in
her
hearing
but
who
yet
appeared
to
take
such
a
deep
interest
in
elma
welfare
once
with
a
sigh
the
girl
had
regretted
that
her
mother
disapproved
of
some
of
the
nicest
people
in
the
neighbourhood
was
geoffrey
greville
to
be
regarded
as
representing
that
vague
quantity
again
with
a
second
sigh
elma
had
confessed
that
the
county
people
on
their
side
showed
no
desire
to
cultivate
her
own
acquaintance
this
afternoon
with
a
blush
she
had
maintained
that
the
best
road
lay
through
steadway
though
a
signpost
persistently
pointed
in
another
direction
two
sighs
and
a
blush
in
the
court
of
love
such
evidence
is
weighty
while
of
still
greater
import
was
the
manner
in
which
elma
clung
for
support
to
the
arm
on
the
right
leaving
only
the
gentlest
pressure
on
that
to
the
left
as
for
the
man
himself
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
had
reached
the
stage
of
entire
subjugation
his
whole
bearing
was
instinct
with
possessive
pride
his
strong
bronzed
features
softened
into
a
beautiful
tenderness
as
he
watched
the
flickering
colour
in
elma
cheeks
and
smiled
encouragement
into
her
eyes
he
had
a
good
face
a
trifle
arrogant
and
no
doubt
but
these
were
failings
which
would
be
mitigated
by
the
power
of
an
honest
love
for
the
rest
he
looked
strong
and
brave
and
true
cornelia
frown
gave
way
to
a
smile
of
approval
i
guess
it
just
about
as
a
little
romance
as
you
can
read
for
a
dollar
and
just
as
english
her
mommar
do
approve
of
him
he
smart
and
worldly
and
mommar
do
approve
of
she
lives
in
a
row
and
do
mix
with
the
set
she
sits
still
and
mopes
and
he
sets
to
and
kills
the
first
thing
that
comes
handy
to
distract
his
thoughts
and
they
going
to
stick
right
there
till
the
door
closed
and
the
lamps
give
out
this
is
where
step
in
cornelia
briskett
you
got
to
waltz
round
and
fix
up
this
business
while
you
a
i
guess
i
been
a
bit
too
bracing
i
better
begin
to
feel
a
bit
scared
about
elma
health
seems
to
me
had
a
pretty
bad
shock
and
wants
to
settle
right
in
and
not
risk
another
move
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
the
scarlet
lips
twisted
whimsically
and
a
dimple
dipped
in
the
white
cheek
if
there
was
one
thing
cornelia
loved
above
another
it
was
to
feel
herself
a
kind
of
ex
and
she
experienced
a
malicious
satisfaction
in
ranging
herself
on
the
side
of
the
lovers
in
the
battle
between
youth
and
age
presently
a
curve
in
the
road
brought
the
house
into
view
and
the
sight
of
its
mullioned
windows
and
old
grey
stone
gables
brought
with
it
a
sudden
remembrance
of
her
own
dishevelled
condition
the
disengaged
hand
darted
up
to
her
head
to
set
the
cap
at
the
correct
angle
and
from
thence
continued
a
patting
excursion
productive
of
distinctly
smartening
results
fortunately
the
long
coat
had
sheltered
the
dress
from
harm
so
that
on
reaching
the
house
she
could
shed
it
and
look
just
so
as
for
elma
it
was
a
comfort
to
see
her
a
little
mussed
for
in
her
conscientious
adherence
to
order
she
sacrificed
much
of
the
picturesque
nature
of
her
beauty
the
great
oak
door
stood
hospitably
open
at
the
inner
glass
door
an
old
butler
appeared
and
was
immediately
despatched
by
the
squire
to
find
his
mistress
and
inform
her
that
her
son
had
brought
home
two
ladies
who
had
experienced
a
carriage
accident
at
the
gates
meantime
geoffrey
led
the
way
into
the
and
while
elma
rested
thankfully
against
the
cushions
on
her
chair
cornelia
enjoyed
her
first
view
of
a
room
in
a
typical
english
country
house
it
fascinated
her
by
its
very
difference
from
the
gorgeous
apartments
which
took
its
place
in
her
own
country
space
daintiness
simplicity
these
were
the
first
impressions
long
french
windows
standing
open
to
a
velvet
stretch
of
lawn
deep
chairs
and
couches
covered
with
chintz
pale
green
walls
and
the
fragrance
of
many
flowers
a
closer
inspection
showed
the
intrinsic
value
and
beauty
of
each
detail
which
went
to
make
up
the
charming
whole
sheraton
cabinets
holding
specimens
of
rare
old
china
ivory
miniatures
of
grevilles
dead
and
gone
simpering
in
beauty
in
the
velvet
cases
on
the
walls
signed
by
famed
artists
wonderful
old
sconces
holding
lines
of
candles
everywhere
the
eye
turned
something
beautiful
rare
and
interesting
and
through
it
all
an
unobtrusive
good
taste
which
placed
the
most
precious
articles
in
quiet
corners
and
filled
the
foreground
with
a
bower
of
flowers
it
just
gaudy
said
cornelia
to
herself
using
her
favourite
superlative
with
sublime
disregard
of
suitability
she
looked
across
the
room
to
where
elma
sat
resting
her
head
against
a
brocaded
blue
cushion
one
of
the
cases
of
miniatures
hung
just
behind
the
chair
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
notice
the
likeness
between
the
living
face
and
those
portrayed
on
the
ivory
backgrounds
actual
similarity
of
feature
might
not
exist
but
the
delicate
colouring
the
fine
lines
of
the
features
the
loosened
cloud
of
hair
made
the
resemblance
striking
enough
if
some
day
elma
own
miniature
should
be
added
to
the
number
it
would
fully
sustain
the
reputation
for
the
beauty
so
long
enjoyed
by
the
women
of
the
house
coming
back
from
the
voyage
of
comparison
cornelia
eyes
met
those
of
the
squire
fixed
upon
her
in
a
questioning
fashion
he
averted
them
instantly
but
all
his
determination
could
not
restrain
the
mantling
blush
which
dyed
his
cheek
and
she
had
little
doubt
that
his
own
thoughts
had
been
a
duplicate
of
her
own
before
the
silence
was
broken
however
the
door
opened
and
mrs
greville
entered
the
room
chapter
nine
it
was
mrs
greville
pleasure
to
be
addressed
as
madame
by
the
members
of
her
household
and
the
name
had
spread
until
it
was
now
adopted
as
a
sobriquet
by
the
entire
neighbourhood
the
tradesmen
instructed
their
underlings
to
pay
implicit
attention
to
madame
orders
the
townsfolk
discussed
madame
clothes
and
manner
alternately
aggrieved
and
elated
as
she
smiled
upon
them
or
stared
them
haughtily
in
the
face
her
friends
adopted
it
for
ease
and
mrs
greville
herself
was
well
pleased
that
it
should
be
so
she
would
have
disdained
a
cheap
title
but
it
seemed
fitting
that
she
should
be
known
by
a
more
distinguished
and
exclusive
designation
than
the
vulgar
mrs
which
was
equally
the
property
of
the
meanest
of
her
dependants
she
was
a
graceful
woman
with
a
narrow
face
aquiline
features
and
a
society
smile
she
dressed
perfectly
in
soft
satins
and
brocades
not
black
but
of
rich
subdued
colours
softened
by
fichus
of
lace
while
her
wonderfully
silky
white
hair
was
dressed
in
the
latest
and
most
elaborate
fashion
her
dress
was
of
a
dull
heliotrope
a
bunch
of
parma
violets
was
fastened
in
the
folds
of
the
fichu
at
the
breast
ruffles
of
old
point
lace
fell
back
from
her
wrists
and
as
she
moved
there
came
the
glint
of
diamonds
discreetly
hidden
away
elma
recalled
her
mother
afternoon
costume
of
black
cashmere
with
prickly
jet
edging
on
the
cuffs
and
felt
several
degrees
more
faint
and
weary
from
pure
nervous
collapse
cornelia
beamed
in
artistic
satisfaction
mother
you
know
mrs
ramsden
this
is
her
daughter
and
her
friend
miss
er
briskett
i
happened
to
be
behind
a
hedge
just
as
their
cart
overturned
it
was
all
the
fault
of
that
lunatic
mrs
moss
what
must
she
do
but
stick
her
blessed
parrot
cage
on
the
side
of
the
road
to
frighten
stray
horses
out
of
their
wits
it
a
mercy
they
were
not
all
killed
miss
ramsden
has
had
a
severe
shock
poor
dear
how
trying
for
you
ejaculated
madame
in
gushing
tones
of
sympathy
what
she
said
was
paw
dar
as
cornelia
was
quick
to
note
storing
up
the
fact
to
produce
next
time
she
herself
was
accused
of
murdering
the
english
language
how
quite
too
senseless
of
mrs
moss
she
really
is
an
impossible
woman
but
so
clean
one
expect
brains
can
one
in
persons
of
that
class
so
sweet
of
you
to
come
up
and
let
us
do
what
we
can
to
comfort
you
it
is
really
our
fault
is
it
employers
liability
you
know
and
that
kind
of
thing
is
the
horse
hurt
your
hands
are
hot
dear
but
you
look
white
now
what
is
it
to
be
tea
wine
sal
volatile
tell
me
just
what
you
think
would
help
you
most
she
held
elma
hand
in
her
own
and
stretched
out
the
other
towards
cornelia
thus
making
both
girls
feel
the
warmth
of
her
welcome
elma
smiled
her
pretty
shy
smile
but
left
it
to
her
friend
to
reply
she
was
considerably
astonished
at
the
sudden
development
of
anxiety
which
the
answer
displayed
i
guess
if
you
do
mind
miss
ramsden
had
better
lie
for
a
spell
she
had
some
brandy
and
a
cup
of
tea
would
be
pretty
comforting
but
it
rest
she
needs
most
of
all
it
a
pretty
hard
strain
sitting
by
and
watching
someone
else
driving
straight
to
glory
when
you
got
something
to
do
there
not
so
much
time
to
think
the
spill
was
bound
to
come
so
it
was
up
to
me
to
choose
the
softest
place
mrs
greville
stared
in
obvious
disregard
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
why
you
are
american
how
odd
i
never
met
an
american
in
norton
before
in
all
the
years
i
have
lived
here
i
not
a
mite
surprised
replied
cornelia
with
a
depth
of
meaning
which
her
hearers
failed
to
fathom
they
imagined
that
she
was
humbly
appreciative
of
her
own
good
fortune
in
visiting
a
neighbourhood
as
yet
preserved
from
the
desecration
of
the
american
tourists
whereas
she
was
mentally
reviewing
the
sleepy
shops
where
the
assistants
took
a
solid
five
minutes
to
procure
twopence
change
the
flies
which
crawled
to
and
from
the
station
the
round
of
village
life
if
providence
had
sent
over
half
a
dozen
more
like
me
a
dozen
years
ago
there
no
saying
but
they
might
be
rubbing
their
knuckles
into
their
eyes
by
now
and
beginning
to
wake
up
i
got
to
butt
right
in
if
i
to
make
any
mark
by
the
end
of
three
months
such
were
the
young
woman
mental
reflections
while
geoffrey
rang
the
bell
and
anticipated
his
mother
order
for
tea
he
was
anxious
that
elma
should
lie
down
then
and
there
but
she
refused
to
do
so
with
a
glance
from
the
delicate
cushions
to
her
own
dusty
boots
openly
expressed
solicitude
had
had
the
not
unnatural
result
of
increasing
her
feeling
of
exhaustion
and
the
colour
flamed
and
faded
in
her
cheeks
as
she
endeavoured
to
drink
tea
and
take
part
in
the
conversation
which
ensued
mother
and
son
watched
her
continuously
the
one
with
unconcealed
anxiety
the
other
with
a
wholly
impersonal
admiration
as
though
the
girl
were
a
new
article
of
furniture
which
fitted
unusually
well
into
its
niche
her
air
was
kindly
enough
but
too
dispassionate
to
be
sympathetic
elma
ramsden
hardly
counted
as
an
independent
human
being
in
the
estimation
of
madame
greville
but
she
was
a
lovely
piece
of
flesh
and
blood
at
whom
it
was
pleasant
to
look
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
her
beauty
were
marred
it
was
more
in
a
spirit
of
a
connoisseur
than
a
friend
that
she
made
the
inquiry
which
her
son
was
already
longing
to
prompt
my
dear
child
you
look
very
ill
how
are
we
going
to
get
you
home
your
own
cart
is
injured
you
say
i
think
you
had
better
have
the
brougham
where
you
can
rest
against
the
cushions
you
shall
have
our
horses
of
course
they
wo
run
away
with
you
though
i
do
say
they
have
never
done
it
before
i
like
a
horse
with
a
spirit
of
its
own
but
these
two
have
been
out
so
they
ought
to
be
pretty
quiet
at
this
reassuring
speech
elma
turned
white
to
the
lips
and
for
a
moment
swayed
in
her
seat
as
if
about
to
faint
cornelia
sprang
to
her
side
while
geoffrey
whispered
to
his
mother
in
urgent
tones
to
which
she
listened
with
lifted
brows
a
final
nod
and
shrug
proved
her
consent
and
she
turned
to
elma
with
a
gracious
air
of
hospitality
madame
could
never
be
less
than
gracious
to
a
guest
in
her
own
house
my
dear
child
forgive
me
i
did
not
realise
how
unnerved
you
were
of
course
you
must
not
dream
of
returning
home
your
mother
and
i
are
old
friends
and
she
will
trust
me
to
take
care
of
you
your
friend
will
tell
her
that
you
are
going
to
rest
quietly
here
until
you
are
better
quite
a
charity
i
assure
you
to
keep
me
company
it
will
remind
me
of
the
days
before
my
own
carol
deserted
me
for
that
monster
and
went
off
to
india
only
daughters
should
not
be
allowed
to
marry
in
their
mother
lifetime
remember
that
when
your
time
comes
you
wo
of
course
but
it
horribly
ungrateful
all
the
same
now
settled
they
can
send
you
out
some
things
but
for
i
can
supply
all
you
need
a
fits
anyone
and
i
a
dream
which
has
just
come
home
that
will
suit
you
to
distraction
worry
any
more
dear
it
all
settled
but
elma
was
palpitating
with
agitation
that
she
elma
ramsden
should
be
invited
to
spend
several
days
at
norton
manor
seemed
altogether
too
unlooked
for
and
extraordinary
a
happening
to
be
realised
she
was
overcome
with
gratitude
with
regret
with
incredulity
for
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
accept
madame
could
not
be
in
earnest
the
invitation
was
merely
a
polite
form
of
speech
even
if
she
did
mean
it
her
own
mother
would
strongly
disapprove
for
did
she
not
consider
madame
a
hopeless
worldling
and
her
son
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
a
type
of
everything
that
a
young
man
should
not
be
oh
no
it
was
quite
quite
impossible
all
the
more
so
that
she
longed
longed
intensely
longed
from
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
to
accept
elma
straightened
herself
in
her
chair
protesting
explaining
thanking
and
refusing
in
confused
broken
sentences
to
which
none
of
her
hearers
paid
the
least
attention
mrs
greville
and
her
son
waived
objections
aside
with
the
easy
certainty
of
victory
while
cornelia
cried
briskly
you
do
hev
a
choice
i
undertook
to
bring
you
out
but
i
wo
take
you
back
if
i
know
it
until
you
ken
sit
behind
a
horse
without
going
off
into
hysterics
every
time
he
tosses
his
mane
your
mother
be
a
heap
more
scared
to
see
you
coming
back
looking
like
a
death
head
than
to
hear
that
you
were
comfortably
located
with
a
friend
till
you
pulled
round
i
guess
there
nothing
for
you
to
do
but
to
say
you
as
prettily
as
you
know
how
and
settle
down
to
be
comfortable
why
make
a
fuss
that
last
exhortation
was
decisive
elma
blushingly
subsided
into
the
silence
which
gives
consent
and
was
forthwith
escorted
to
the
room
which
was
to
be
given
over
to
her
use
there
to
rest
quietly
until
it
should
be
time
to
dress
for
dinner
unless
she
would
like
to
go
to
bed
at
once
do
you
think
that
would
be
the
better
plan
madame
asked
cornelia
in
a
whispered
aside
but
that
young
lady
was
quick
to
veto
a
retirement
which
would
be
so
detrimental
to
the
progress
of
the
cure
which
she
had
at
heart
why
no
indeed
to
be
left
alone
to
worry
herself
ill
brooding
over
the
whole
affair
is
about
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
to
her
just
now
it
was
only
a
spill
but
it
seems
the
worst
accident
that
the
world
ever
knew
to
her
she
got
to
be
roused
i
sit
up
here
and
see
that
she
rests
quietly
for
an
hour
and
then
i
fix
her
up
for
the
evening
so
she
can
lie
on
a
sofa
and
listen
while
you
talk
i
must
get
home
by
seven
to
soothe
the
old
ladies
it
would
be
real
sweet
if
you
lend
something
to
take
me
back
i
afraid
i
walk
all
the
way
madame
laughed
pleasantly
i
wish
we
could
keep
you
too
but
it
would
not
be
kind
to
mrs
ramsden
to
leave
her
with
only
a
message
i
must
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
another
time
you
american
girls
are
so
bright
and
amusing
and
i
love
to
be
amused
my
son
wishes
me
to
have
a
companion
but
a
young
woman
who
knew
her
place
would
exasperate
me
to
distraction
and
i
should
kill
anyone
who
took
liberties
so
the
situation
is
a
little
hard
to
fill
do
tell
me
who
you
are
where
are
you
staying
in
norton
and
how
long
have
you
been
in
england
just
over
three
weeks
and
i
like
it
pretty
well
thank
you
returned
cornelia
anticipating
the
inevitable
question
though
i
guess
i
not
struck
the
liveliest
spot
in
the
land
i
located
with
my
aunt
miss
briskett
in
the
park
and
my
poppar
coming
over
to
fetch
me
in
the
fall
madame
interest
waned
with
surprising
suddenness
of
an
american
girl
almost
more
than
any
other
is
that
worldly
adage
true
that
it
is
wise
to
treat
her
politely
since
there
is
no
knowing
whom
she
may
ultimately
marry
a
girl
of
such
striking
appearance
and
obvious
affluence
might
belong
to
anyone
or
become
anything
in
these
radical
days
the
mother
of
a
son
with
broad
acres
and
small
income
could
not
but
remember
that
a
large
proportion
of
duchesses
hail
from
across
the
water
but
it
was
a
very
different
matter
when
the
young
woman
suddenly
assumed
the
personality
of
the
niece
of
a
spinster
resident
at
the
manor
gates
to
mrs
greville
miss
briskett
stood
as
a
type
of
all
that
was
narrow
conventional
and
depressing
as
much
as
she
could
trouble
herself
to
dislike
any
woman
outside
her
own
world
she
disliked
the
rigid
spinster
and
was
fully
aware
that
the
dislike
was
returned
miss
briskett
invariably
declined
the
yearly
invitations
which
were
doled
out
to
her
in
company
with
the
other
townsfolk
satisfied
that
in
so
doing
she
proclaimed
a
dignified
disapproval
of
the
frivolities
of
the
manor
thank
goodness
that
old
cat
not
coming
was
madame
invariable
reception
of
the
refusals
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
resented
the
fact
that
so
insignificant
a
person
should
dare
to
reject
her
hospitality
miss
briskett
niece
really
how
interesting
she
drawled
in
a
tone
eloquent
of
the
most
superlative
indifference
her
easy
graciousness
of
manner
became
suddenly
instinct
with
patronage
her
eyelids
drooped
with
languid
disdain
she
sauntered
round
the
room
giving
a
touch
here
and
there
turned
over
the
garments
which
her
maid
had
laid
on
the
bed
ready
for
elma
use
and
finally
sailed
towards
the
door
we
will
leave
you
to
rest
then
as
long
as
you
think
fit
pray
ring
for
anything
you
require
the
door
closed
leaving
elma
to
snoodle
down
on
her
pillows
with
a
sigh
of
relief
while
cornelia
lifted
her
skirt
in
both
hands
and
danced
a
pas
seul
bowing
low
towards
the
doorway
blowing
kisses
from
her
the
while
after
the
manner
of
riders
in
a
circus
she
pranced
and
pirouetted
while
elma
protested
in
shocked
surprise
it
struck
her
that
cornelia
anxiety
as
to
her
own
condition
had
died
a
remarkably
sudden
death
with
the
disappearance
of
mrs
greville
from
the
room
a
pantomimic
display
was
not
the
best
way
to
ensure
quiet
and
repose
nor
was
there
much
sympathy
to
be
read
in
the
expression
of
the
twinkling
golden
eyes
elma
found
herself
blushing
before
their
gaze
and
guiltily
drooping
her
lashes
cornelia
what
do
you
mean
columns
my
dear
which
sweet
little
buds
like
you
ought
to
know
nothing
about
you
lie
still
and
look
pretty
and
ask
no
questions
that
part
in
the
play
you
got
to
remember
that
you
had
a
shock
and
your
nervous
system
all
to
pieces
you
do
have
no
pain
nor
suffering
and
anyone
to
look
at
you
might
think
you
were
quite
robust
but
just
as
soon
as
you
make
the
least
exertion
all
of
a
flop
and
have
to
be
waited
on
hand
and
foot
that
so
it
now
elma
delicate
brows
were
furrowed
in
her
attempt
to
make
out
what
cornelia
mean
and
what
she
did
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
which
did
not
ring
true
a
mocking
note
which
accorded
ill
with
the
words
themselves
she
blushed
still
deeper
and
put
on
an
air
of
wounded
dignity
i
certainly
am
very
far
from
well
my
head
feels
so
light
and
swimming
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
have
to
walk
far
at
present
coming
upstairs
just
now
tried
me
horribly
cornelia
clapped
her
hands
in
approval
capital
capital
keep
it
at
that
and
you
ca
do
better
go
slow
and
do
try
to
mend
all
of
a
sudden
even
when
you
begin
to
buck
up
in
a
day
or
two
time
the
very
sight
of
a
horse
will
set
you
palpitating
for
all
you
worth
you
feel
as
if
rather
crawl
home
on
all
fours
than
sit
behind
the
steadiest
old
nag
that
was
ever
raised
it
three
or
four
miles
from
home
is
it
or
maybe
more
much
too
far
for
an
invalid
to
attempt
for
a
week
at
least
just
a
little
saunter
in
the
grounds
will
be
all
you
fit
for
this
side
sunday
someone
to
support
you
carefully
as
you
you
be
apt
to
turn
giddy
if
you
go
about
alone
have
you
gotten
that
nicely
off
by
heart
now
so
you
wo
go
forgetting
at
the
wrong
moments
why
should
i
forget
surely
my
own
feelings
will
be
my
best
guide
yes
said
cornelia
demurely
she
let
her
lids
droop
over
her
eyes
and
stood
beside
the
couch
for
a
long
eloquent
moment
during
which
the
flickering
colour
deepened
on
elma
cheek
then
turned
aside
took
down
a
book
from
a
shelf
and
settled
herself
comfortably
on
a
wicker
chair
i
guess
we
understand
one
another
and
there
no
more
to
be
said
now
for
one
hour
by
the
clock
you
to
shut
your
eyes
and
be
quiet
go
to
sleep
if
you
can
i
wake
you
up
in
time
for
the
prinking
elma
buried
her
head
in
the
cushions
and
shed
a
silent
tear
cornelia
was
laughing
at
her
and
she
could
not
bear
it
her
mind
trained
to
habits
of
introspection
began
at
once
to
wonder
if
she
were
pretending
as
the
other
seemed
to
think
if
the
agitation
which
she
felt
was
not
so
much
the
result
of
the
accident
as
caused
by
the
excitement
of
seeing
geoffrey
greville
and
meeting
his
ardent
glances
the
prospect
of
remaining
in
the
same
house
and
of
meeting
him
from
hour
to
hour
was
incredible
but
delightful
yet
elma
would
give
it
up
a
hundred
times
over
rather
than
accept
hospitality
under
false
pretences
was
it
her
duty
to
insist
upon
returning
home
should
she
announce
that
she
felt
so
much
refreshed
by
her
rest
that
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
why
she
should
be
treated
as
an
invalid
the
sinking
feeling
of
disappointment
which
followed
this
inspiration
was
easily
mistaken
for
a
physical
symptom
yes
she
ill
it
was
quite
true
that
she
felt
faint
surreptitiously
she
felt
her
own
pulse
and
was
convinced
that
its
beat
had
increased
she
thought
of
the
expression
of
geoffrey
eyes
as
he
lifted
her
from
the
ground
blushed
and
felt
certain
that
she
was
feverish
yes
she
would
stay
it
would
be
foolish
and
ungrateful
to
refuse
mother
had
always
warned
her
not
to
run
risks
where
health
was
concerned
a
soft
little
sigh
of
contentment
sounded
through
the
room
if
elma
had
been
fifteen
years
younger
this
was
the
moment
at
which
a
warm
sticky
little
thumb
would
have
crept
into
her
mouth
as
a
sign
that
earthly
cares
were
swept
aside
and
that
she
had
resigned
herself
to
slumber
being
a
young
woman
of
sweet
and
twenty
she
snoodled
her
head
into
the
pillow
and
fell
fast
asleep
for
over
an
hour
she
slept
and
woke
to
find
cornelia
leaning
back
in
her
chair
watching
her
while
the
book
lay
closed
on
her
lap
for
a
moment
she
hardly
recognised
the
face
which
she
had
always
seen
animated
and
defiant
but
which
was
now
softened
into
so
sweet
a
tenderness
a
lightning
thought
flashed
through
her
mind
that
it
was
thus
cornelia
would
look
if
ever
in
the
time
to
come
she
watched
by
the
bedside
of
her
own
child
she
smiled
lazily
and
stretched
out
a
caressing
hand
why
cornelia
have
you
been
sitting
there
all
the
time
how
dull
for
you
how
long
have
i
been
asleep
it
half
after
five
so
we
must
be
lively
if
i
am
to
get
back
in
time
to
settle
the
old
ladies
and
get
ready
for
dinner
hustle
now
help
you
to
shed
your
own
duds
and
then
pipe
up
for
the
transformation
that
the
limit
i
thought
i
knew
the
last
thing
there
was
to
learn
about
clothes
but
i
would
be
above
going
in
for
a
course
of
from
the
woman
who
fixed
those
frills
this
is
going
to
be
an
historic
occasion
for
you
my
friend
your
sinful
nature
is
kinder
dead
to
the
joys
of
frillies
but
there
going
to
be
a
big
awakening
the
woman
is
born
who
could
come
out
of
that
gown
the
same
as
she
went
in
she
lifted
the
blue
serge
skirt
over
elma
head
and
surveyed
the
plain
hem
with
tragic
eyes
it
pretty
hard
luck
to
be
born
a
woman
instead
of
a
man
but
it
softens
it
some
to
have
a
swirl
of
frills
round
one
ankles
if
i
to
poke
around
with
a
hem
i
give
up
now
then
sit
still
where
you
are
while
i
fix
your
hair
i
going
to
do
it
a
way
of
my
own
that
will
be
more
comfy
for
leaning
up
against
cushions
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
say
so
but
i
guess
you
will
she
brushed
the
soft
light
tresses
to
the
top
of
elma
head
and
arranged
them
skilfully
in
curls
and
loops
from
time
to
time
she
retreated
a
step
or
two
as
if
to
study
the
effect
returning
to
heighten
a
curl
or
loosen
the
sweep
over
the
forehead
in
reality
she
was
reproducing
as
nearly
as
possible
the
coiffure
of
one
of
the
beauties
in
miniature
hanging
on
the
walls
behind
the
couch
on
which
elma
would
probably
pass
the
evening
it
might
chance
that
the
eyes
of
mother
or
son
would
observe
the
likeness
between
the
two
girlish
faces
a
fact
which
could
not
but
score
in
elma
favour
when
the
dainty
white
robe
was
fastened
and
each
ribbon
and
lace
patted
into
its
place
by
skilful
fingers
then
and
not
till
then
elma
was
allowed
to
regard
herself
in
the
glass
it
was
a
startling
revelation
of
her
own
beauty
but
the
predominant
feeling
was
not
elation
but
distress
accustomed
as
she
was
to
a
simplicity
elma
felt
almost
shocked
at
her
own
changed
appearance
the
sweeping
folds
of
the
gown
gave
additional
height
to
her
figure
her
neck
looked
like
a
round
white
pillar
above
the
square
of
lace
the
quaintly
arranged
tresses
gave
a
touch
of
piquancy
to
her
gentle
features
an
involuntary
and
quite
impersonal
admiration
was
followed
by
quick
repentance
cornelia
i
ca
i
ca
go
down
like
this
i
dare
do
it
i
look
like
an
actress
so
dressed
up
just
as
if
i
to
look
nice
cornelia
sniffed
eloquently
well
do
you
yes
but
but
i
do
like
to
as
if
i
did
oh
cornelia
could
i
put
on
my
own
dress
again
and
do
my
hair
the
old
way
be
so
much
happier
the
grevilles
would
you
got
to
remember
that
they
are
used
to
finery
and
not
to
having
young
women
sitting
round
in
blue
serge
in
the
evening
it
seems
gaudy
to
you
but
it
just
dead
to
them
and
wo
raise
a
ripple
you
look
a
daisy
and
i
proud
of
you
and
if
you
had
a
mite
of
feeling
you
say
you
instead
of
finding
fault
after
all
my
work
elma
wheeled
round
surprised
another
glance
of
tender
admiration
and
held
out
impulsive
hands
cornelia
you
are
good
i
thank
you
i
know
quite
well
that
you
you
are
trying
i
love
you
cornelia
oh
shucks
cried
cornelia
hastily
do
gush
i
hate
gush
take
my
arm
and
come
along
downstairs
lean
on
it
pretty
heavily
mind
your
spirit
too
much
for
your
strength
and
you
are
apt
to
forget
that
you
are
an
invalid
you
got
to
keep
a
check
on
yourself
my
dear
and
remember
that
a
nervous
shock
a
ticklish
thing
and
needs
a
lot
of
tending
elma
head
drooped
she
twisted
her
fingers
together
and
glanced
beneath
the
lashes
at
her
friend
face
glanced
timidly
questioningly
as
it
were
in
dread
cornelia
deliberately
chapter
ten
geoffrey
was
lounging
about
in
the
hall
as
the
two
girls
descended
the
wide
staircase
his
attitude
gave
the
impression
that
he
had
been
impatiently
awaiting
their
advent
and
as
he
took
in
elma
changed
looks
in
one
comprehensive
sweep
his
eyes
brightened
with
an
expression
before
which
her
lids
drooped
in
embarrassment
he
came
forward
eagerly
to
lead
the
way
into
the
where
madame
sat
reading
by
an
open
window
and
a
sofa
had
been
pulled
forward
and
banked
with
cushions
in
readiness
for
the
invalid
she
smiled
a
welcome
as
the
little
procession
entered
the
room
and
looked
on
with
an
amused
scrutiny
while
cornelia
shook
out
the
cushions
skilfully
altering
their
position
so
that
the
blue
brocade
should
form
the
background
for
elma
fair
head
she
did
not
attempt
to
rise
but
her
words
were
kindly
enough
if
a
trifle
patronising
well
dear
and
how
are
you
now
after
your
rest
we
must
take
care
of
you
and
not
let
you
get
overtired
sure
you
are
comfortable
you
look
too
sweet
in
that
gown
i
shall
never
have
the
heart
to
wear
it
after
you
is
it
wicked
that
a
woman
is
obliged
to
live
on
after
her
complexion
has
faded
i
could
bear
any
affliction
better
than
watching
myself
growing
uglier
every
day
i
should
have
a
little
pillow
tucked
into
your
back
sure
you
wo
feel
the
draught
right
and
you
really
must
leave
us
miss
briskett
could
possibly
stay
to
dinner
i
suppose
it
be
unkind
the
is
waiting
for
you
i
told
them
to
have
it
round
by
seven
geoffrey
will
drive
you
home
of
course
after
your
adventure
this
afternoon
we
should
not
be
happy
to
leave
you
to
a
groom
he
see
you
safely
to
the
door
and
report
to
us
on
your
safe
arrival
geoffrey
face
clouded
involuntarily
he
had
mapped
out
a
much
more
interesting
programme
for
himself
deciding
to
slip
upstairs
and
dress
for
dinner
so
early
that
he
should
be
able
to
descend
the
moment
that
his
mother
was
securely
shut
into
her
own
room
madame
evening
toilette
was
a
matter
of
of
an
hour
at
least
during
which
time
he
would
have
elma
all
to
himself
to
speak
to
to
look
at
to
make
her
look
at
him
lovely
creature
he
had
not
realised
how
beautiful
she
was
and
so
sweet
and
gentle
and
shy
what
a
marvel
to
meet
a
girl
in
these
days
of
smoking
women
a
man
may
appreciate
the
society
of
a
damsel
whom
he
designates
as
a
rattling
good
sort
but
he
wants
a
womanly
woman
for
his
wife
elma
was
womanliness
personified
a
sweet
white
creature
whose
eyes
regarded
the
masculine
creature
with
an
unspoken
tribute
of
homage
you
are
so
big
they
seemed
to
say
i
am
so
little
oh
please
be
kind
to
me
inspired
by
that
look
geoffrey
was
capable
of
fighting
dragons
on
her
behalf
and
now
he
was
consigned
to
drive
home
a
tiresome
american
girl
who
was
remarkably
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
mentally
he
fumed
outwardly
being
a
man
of
the
world
he
smiled
and
murmured
delighted
with
an
imitation
of
enthusiasm
which
won
admiration
one
to
you
mr
greville
you
played
up
real
well
was
the
mental
comment
as
she
dropped
a
kiss
on
elma
brow
and
listened
to
her
anxious
messages
tell
mother
not
to
be
anxious
tell
her
i
not
really
ill
only
silly
and
nervous
tell
her
i
shall
soon
be
well
that
all
right
my
dear
i
cool
her
fevered
brow
your
mother
be
a
circumstance
compared
with
aunt
soph
i
have
to
promise
never
to
look
at
a
horse
again
while
i
in
this
country
she
turned
towards
mrs
greville
with
easy
it
real
good
of
you
to
send
me
back
and
take
such
care
of
us
both
so
pleased
to
have
met
you
madame
extended
her
thin
ringed
hand
laughing
softly
the
while
as
she
had
said
she
loved
to
be
amused
and
this
american
girl
was
quite
too
ridiculously
audacious
actually
one
might
have
supposed
that
she
believed
herself
to
be
speaking
to
an
equal
cornelia
and
geoffrey
greville
passed
along
the
hall
with
its
great
oak
fireplace
filled
in
with
branches
of
spreading
beech
its
decorations
of
tapestry
of
armour
of
stags
heads
of
cases
of
stuffed
birds
the
ceiling
was
beamed
with
oak
the
floor
was
polished
to
a
dangerous
brightness
and
covered
in
the
centre
by
an
ancient
persian
rug
cornelia
had
never
seen
such
an
interior
except
as
it
is
imitated
on
the
stage
her
own
tessellated
entrance
hall
in
new
york
was
as
far
removed
from
it
on
the
one
side
as
on
the
other
was
the
square
of
decorated
with
a
and
two
mahogany
chairs
which
at
the
nook
was
dignified
by
the
same
title
she
admired
but
admired
with
reservations
kinder
mouldy
summoned
up
the
ultimate
verdict
geoffrey
moved
moodily
towards
the
doorway
though
bitterly
annoyed
at
his
mother
interference
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
wreak
his
vengeance
on
the
innocent
cause
of
his
exile
as
a
mitigation
of
the
penance
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
occupy
the
time
of
absence
by
talking
of
elma
since
he
might
not
talk
to
her
but
providence
was
merciful
and
came
to
his
aid
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
inner
door
opened
and
captain
guest
appeared
upon
the
threshold
cap
in
hand
evidently
returning
from
a
solitary
ramble
and
by
no
means
overjoyed
to
have
arrived
at
such
an
inopportune
moment
he
bowed
murmured
some
inarticulate
greeting
and
would
have
passed
by
had
not
geoffrey
eagerly
blocked
the
way
for
the
moment
the
claims
of
friendship
were
existent
he
did
not
care
whether
guest
were
pleased
or
annoyed
he
was
simply
a
means
of
escape
to
be
seized
on
without
compunction
halloa
here
you
are
just
the
man
i
wanted
he
cried
genially
you
shall
have
the
privilege
of
driving
miss
briskett
home
i
was
going
to
take
her
myself
but
i
got
some
rather
er
pressing
business
to
attend
to
before
dinner
he
chuckled
mentally
over
the
application
of
the
words
so
i
stand
aside
in
your
favour
we
are
not
going
to
trust
her
out
of
our
sight
until
she
is
delivered
safely
into
her
keeping
awfully
sorry
miss
briskett
but
we
shall
meet
again
come
up
to
see
miss
ramsden
wo
you
do
come
come
on
saturday
we
could
make
up
a
game
of
tennis
if
she
is
fit
enough
by
that
time
he
helped
cornelia
to
her
seat
courteously
yet
with
an
underlying
haste
which
could
not
be
concealed
captain
guest
gave
him
one
look
a
murderous
look
and
murmured
delighted
i
shaw
in
tones
of
ice
cornelia
felt
ugly
and
looked
delightful
head
erect
lips
pursed
eyes
just
as
mad
as
he
can
be
to
be
obliged
to
be
civil
to
girl
for
a
short
half
hour
guess
there
one
or
two
several
sizes
bigger
than
him
who
would
cross
the
ocean
for
the
chance
he
english
real
english
the
sort
that
fixed
up
with
liquid
prejudice
for
blood
and
made
to
see
nothing
on
earth
but
the
british
empire
rather
skeery
at
the
present
moment
at
being
set
down
beside
a
bold
american
hussy
with
only
a
groom
as
chaperon
well
i
always
was
i
pile
it
on
all
i
know
to
fix
him
in
his
opinions
i
made
so
i
ke
endoore
to
disappoint
anyone
in
his
expectations
she
turned
deliberately
to
stare
at
the
silent
figure
by
her
side
certainly
he
was
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
her
own
countrymen
who
would
have
travelled
so
far
as
to
take
his
place
would
have
to
be
giants
if
the
several
sizes
bigger
were
to
be
taken
in
literal
earnest
the
lean
cheek
showed
the
square
formation
of
the
jaw
the
lips
were
clean
shaven
the
eyes
dark
thickly
lashed
and
browed
the
only
handsome
feature
in
the
face
cornelia
mentally
pulled
herself
together
as
guest
turned
his
head
and
cast
a
fleeting
glance
at
her
beneath
his
drooping
lids
i
was
sorry
to
hear
that
your
friend
is
too
ill
to
be
moved
i
imagined
at
the
time
that
she
was
worse
than
you
realised
she
she
is
anyhow
and
that
about
as
good
as
the
real
thing
perhaps
better
where
health
concerned
some
people
do
need
much
to
upset
elma
one
i
guess
there
never
much
snap
to
her
the
dark
brows
arched
expressively
really
i
am
afraid
i
hardly
er
understand
the
expression
you
would
returned
cornelia
calmly
it
do
seem
to
flourish
in
this
part
of
the
country
at
home
we
reckon
no
one
much
use
without
it
so
i
have
heard
captain
guest
understanding
of
the
term
seemed
to
have
been
more
complete
than
he
would
acknowledge
our
standards
differ
however
may
be
a
useful
commodity
in
the
business
world
but
one
resents
its
intrusion
into
private
life
the
very
name
is
objectionable
in
connection
with
a
girl
like
miss
ramsden
with
any
english
girl
cornelia
curled
her
red
lips
yes
they
flop
and
you
like
floppy
kind
of
ivy
round
a
stalwart
oak
or
a
sweet
wayside
rose
a
rose
no
amount
of
description
could
convey
the
intonation
which
she
threw
into
that
short
word
the
o
was
lengthened
indefinitely
giving
a
quaint
effect
to
the
word
which
sounded
at
the
same
time
incredibly
full
of
suggestion
guest
flushed
with
annoyed
understanding
even
before
cornelia
proceeded
to
enlarge
the
makes
a
nice
soft
wadding
all
round
to
keep
the
little
buds
safe
and
hidden
we
use
it
quite
a
good
deal
at
home
for
packing
curios
moss
it
apt
to
get
a
bit
stale
with
keeping
do
you
think
no
doubt
but
even
so
it
retains
some
of
its
fragrance
in
its
worst
state
i
should
be
sorry
to
exchange
it
for
it
was
now
the
turn
to
throw
all
his
power
of
expression
into
one
short
word
cornelia
laugh
held
a
curious
mingling
of
irritation
and
pleasure
it
was
poor
fun
having
a
quarrel
all
to
herself
and
it
whetted
her
appetite
to
find
a
combatant
who
was
capable
of
hitting
back
she
sat
up
very
straight
in
her
seat
tossing
her
head
backward
in
quick
assertive
little
jerks
and
clasping
her
bare
hands
on
her
lap
guest
glanced
at
her
curiously
from
his
point
of
vantage
in
the
rear
she
was
like
no
other
girl
whom
he
had
met
but
somewhere
in
pictured
form
he
must
surely
have
seen
such
a
face
for
it
struck
some
sleeping
chord
of
memory
a
fantasy
perhaps
of
some
norse
goddess
or
flame
deity
a
wild
weird
head
painted
in
reds
and
whites
with
wonderful
shaded
locks
and
small
white
face
aglow
with
the
fire
within
his
lips
twisted
in
an
involuntary
smile
could
anything
be
more
aggressively
unlike
the
sweet
rose
of
which
she
had
spoken
i
guess
if
you
go
to
the
root
of
things
a
man
picture
of
a
woman
is
cut
out
to
fit
into
his
own
niche
if
he
very
big
himself
only
a
little
corner
left
for
her
a
nookey
little
corner
where
the
moss
can
grow
but
the
plant
do
have
much
scope
to
spread
if
he
take
much
stock
of
himself
he
stands
back
and
gives
her
the
front
place
then
she
gets
her
chance
and
shoots
ahead
guest
laughed
in
his
turn
an
exasperating
little
laugh
eloquent
of
an
immense
superiority
and
disdain
you
speak
in
an
allegory
an
allegory
of
english
and
american
life
i
am
quite
aware
that
with
you
the
sexes
have
reversed
positions
that
the
man
has
sunk
into
a
machine
who
slaves
so
that
his
wife
may
spend
while
the
woman
devotes
her
whole
life
to
dress
and
frivolity
have
you
ever
been
in
my
country
cornelia
was
brought
up
short
and
sharp
by
an
unexpected
assent
to
disparage
america
was
an
unforgivable
offence
and
she
was
prepared
to
denounce
the
judgment
of
ignorance
in
words
of
flame
her
anger
was
not
abated
but
merely
turned
in
another
direction
by
the
discovery
that
it
was
not
ignorance
but
blindness
which
she
had
now
to
denounce
the
blindness
of
the
obtuse
englishman
who
had
been
granted
a
privilege
which
he
was
incapable
of
appreciating
some
people
travel
about
with
such
a
heap
of
prejudice
as
baggage
that
they
might
as
well
stay
at
home
and
be
done
with
it
englishmen
pride
themselves
on
being
conservative
and
if
they
once
gotten
an
idea
into
their
heads
it
takes
they
ever
see
with
their
eyes
to
get
it
out
i
guess
you
spent
your
time
in
my
country
seeing
just
exactly
what
you
calculated
on
from
the
start
it
big
enough
to
rear
all
sorts
and
enlightened
enough
to
hold
it
is
certainly
very
big
assented
guest
in
a
tone
of
colourless
civility
cornelia
hated
him
for
his
indifference
his
patronage
his
antagonism
she
was
accustomed
to
a
surfeit
of
masculine
attention
and
cherished
a
complacent
faith
in
her
own
fascinations
it
was
a
new
and
disagreeable
experience
to
meet
a
man
who
so
far
from
exhibiting
the
symptoms
of
subjugation
was
honestly
anxious
to
avoid
her
society
to
feel
herself
disliked
to
be
a
bore
to
two
men
the
one
eager
to
hand
her
over
to
his
friend
the
other
furious
at
being
so
trapped
can
the
world
contain
a
deeper
degradation
for
feminine
cornelia
mood
changed
before
it
the
excitement
which
had
tided
her
over
the
events
of
the
afternoon
died
away
to
be
succeeded
by
a
wave
of
sickening
she
was
lonesome
she
wanted
her
poppar
she
hated
this
pokey
place
and
everyone
in
it
she
guessed
she
take
a
cabin
in
the
first
boat
and
sail
away
home
her
lips
quivered
and
she
blinked
rapidly
to
suppress
a
threatening
tear
she
would
rather
shoot
herself
than
cry
before
this
patronising
englishman
but
it
was
almost
past
endurance
to
play
second
fiddle
all
the
afternoon
be
snubbed
on
the
way
home
and
look
forward
to
an
evening
spent
in
propitiating
two
nervous
old
ladies
i
do
get
any
in
this
play
soliloquised
cornelia
sadly
i
can
see
there
is
a
soul
in
great
britain
that
cares
a
dump
about
me
at
the
present
moment
except
maybe
aunt
soph
and
she
like
me
a
heap
better
at
a
distance
she
sighed
involuntarily
and
captain
guest
watching
her
from
beneath
his
lowered
lids
was
visited
by
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
while
criticising
another
his
own
behaviour
had
not
been
above
reproach
now
that
the
girl
had
lost
her
aggressive
air
and
looked
tired
and
sad
the
feminine
element
made
its
appeal
arrogance
gave
place
to
sympathy
prejudice
to
she
was
only
a
little
thing
after
all
and
as
slim
as
a
reed
rapidly
reviewing
the
incidents
of
the
afternoon
he
was
as
much
surprised
as
shocked
at
the
recollection
of
his
own
discourtesy
this
stranger
had
overheard
his
frank
declaration
of
dislike
had
probably
also
seen
the
glance
of
reproach
which
he
had
cast
upon
greville
in
the
porch
before
starting
out
on
this
drive
twice
in
a
few
hours
had
he
overstepped
the
bounds
of
politeness
he
who
flattered
himself
on
presenting
an
unimpeachable
exterior
whatever
might
be
the
inward
emotions
the
explanation
of
the
lapse
was
a
suddenly
conceived
prejudice
at
the
moment
of
first
meeting
the
girl
jaunty
possession
had
struck
a
false
note
and
he
had
labelled
her
as
callous
and
selfish
now
looking
at
her
afresh
he
realised
that
this
was
not
the
face
of
a
woman
this
girl
could
she
was
feeling
now
feeling
something
painful
depressing
his
eyes
fell
once
more
on
her
ungloved
hands
he
noticed
that
she
held
the
right
wrist
tightly
grasped
and
even
as
he
did
so
memory
flashed
back
a
picture
of
her
as
she
had
stood
above
him
on
the
bank
her
hands
held
in
the
same
strained
position
afterwards
he
marvelled
at
the
accuracy
of
that
brain
picture
but
for
the
moment
concern
overwhelmed
every
other
feeling
the
inquiry
came
in
quick
almost
boyish
tones
strangely
different
from
his
previous
utterances
i
say
have
you
hurt
your
wrist
you
are
holding
it
as
if
it
were
painful
cornelia
turned
to
see
a
face
as
altered
as
the
voice
elevated
her
brows
in
involuntary
surprise
and
drawled
an
indifferent
assent
i
guess
i
ricked
it
hanging
on
to
those
reins
it
was
pulled
half
out
of
the
sockets
did
you
have
anything
done
for
it
at
the
house
no
or
tell
anyone
about
it
no
but
why
not
i
never
yelp
said
cornelia
proudly
she
tilted
her
chin
and
her
eyes
sent
out
a
golden
flash
there
was
enough
of
that
business
going
on
without
my
joining
in
the
chorus
if
you
hurt
it
do
mend
it
any
to
make
a
fuss
guest
looked
at
her
curiously
you
certainly
did
not
yelp
i
thought
you
had
escaped
entirely
and
that
your
friend
had
come
in
for
all
the
knocking
about
i
awfully
sorry
sprains
are
beastly
things
look
here
if
you
do
want
to
be
crippled
it
ought
to
be
massaged
at
once
i
knowing
about
sprains
had
an
ankle
cured
in
a
couple
of
days
by
a
swedish
fellow
which
would
have
laid
me
up
for
weeks
on
the
old
methods
the
great
point
is
to
keep
the
blood
from
congealing
in
the
veins
of
course
it
must
be
done
in
the
right
way
or
it
will
do
more
harm
than
good
you
set
to
work
directly
the
joint
er
would
you
allow
me
might
i
show
you
for
just
a
moment
the
horse
was
ambling
peacefully
along
a
quiet
lane
and
as
he
spoke
captain
guest
twisted
the
reins
loosely
round
his
own
wrist
and
half
held
out
his
hands
then
drew
them
back
again
in
obvious
embarrassment
the
shyness
was
all
on
his
own
side
however
for
cornelia
cried
why
suttenly
in
frank
response
and
pulled
back
the
loose
lawn
sleeve
to
leave
her
wrist
more
fully
exposed
she
watched
with
keen
interest
while
he
rubbed
upward
with
gentle
pressure
increased
gradually
as
she
showed
no
sign
of
pain
or
shrinking
that
the
way
upward
always
upward
follow
the
line
of
the
blood
vessels
you
see
he
traced
a
fine
blue
line
with
the
end
of
a
big
finger
while
the
groom
rolled
curious
eyes
from
behind
rehearsing
a
dramatic
recital
in
the
servants
hall
after
that
has
been
done
once
or
twice
tackle
the
joint
itself
and
you
be
astonished
at
the
effect
is
there
anyone
in
the
house
who
can
do
it
for
you
you
could
do
a
good
deal
for
yourself
you
know
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
like
this
give
me
the
left
hand
and
i
show
you
how
to
work
the
joint
itself
cornelia
edged
round
in
her
seat
to
adopt
a
more
convenient
position
and
laid
her
hand
in
his
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
such
a
slip
of
a
thing
it
looked
lying
on
his
big
brown
paw
soft
and
white
with
carefully
manicured
nails
transparent
faintly
pink
guest
loved
a
pretty
hand
and
held
theories
of
its
value
as
an
exponent
of
character
the
future
mrs
guest
might
or
might
not
be
handsome
as
fate
decreed
but
it
was
inconceivable
that
he
could
ever
marry
a
woman
with
red
fingers
or
bitten
nails
a
pure
artistic
delight
possessed
him
at
the
sight
of
cornelia
little
hand
but
the
soft
confident
touch
of
it
against
his
palm
brought
with
it
a
thrill
of
something
deeper
he
gave
his
demonstration
with
a
touch
of
awkwardness
but
the
girl
herself
was
as
placidly
as
if
he
had
been
a
maiden
aunt
buttoning
up
a
glove
she
put
question
after
question
requested
him
to
show
her
again
and
gripped
his
own
wrist
to
prove
that
she
had
mastered
the
desired
movements
a
more
manner
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
guest
doubted
if
another
girl
of
his
acquaintance
would
have
shown
such
an
utter
absence
of
it
was
admirable
of
course
quite
admirable
but
he
took
up
the
reins
with
a
little
rankle
of
disappointment
mingling
with
his
approval
barely
a
mile
now
remained
to
be
traversed
as
the
horse
was
trotting
up
the
long
hill
into
norton
at
the
top
was
the
high
road
at
the
end
of
the
high
road
the
gates
leading
into
the
park
if
anything
remained
to
be
said
it
would
be
wise
to
say
it
now
but
cornelia
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
say
she
sat
in
erect
fashion
her
right
hand
lying
on
her
knee
the
fingers
of
the
left
rubbing
softly
up
the
arm
serenely
oblivious
of
his
presence
guest
cleared
his
throat
once
cleared
it
again
cleared
it
a
third
time
but
the
words
would
not
come
they
passed
through
the
and
drew
up
before
the
holt
where
the
groom
stood
ready
to
assist
cornelia
to
alight
before
guest
could
throw
down
the
reins
she
had
jumped
to
the
ground
and
was
standing
facing
him
on
the
curb
the
slanting
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
fell
on
her
as
she
stood
a
slim
white
slip
of
a
girl
whom
he
could
lift
with
one
hand
a
spirit
as
of
tempered
steel
which
might
bend
but
never
break
i
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
said
cornelia
clearly
as
she
inclined
her
head
towards
him
in
formal
fashion
captain
guest
watched
her
progress
up
the
narrow
path
biting
hard
at
his
lower
lip
courtesy
the
word
stung
the
big
man
felt
uncommonly
small
as
he
turned
his
horse
and
drove
slowly
home
chapter
eleven
at
the
first
shock
of
hearing
of
the
accident
mrs
ramsden
motherly
anxiety
swamped
all
other
feeling
she
forgot
to
disapprove
of
a
woman
who
at
sixty
still
wore
a
pad
on
her
uncapped
head
and
lacy
frills
on
her
petticoat
in
gratitude
to
the
hostess
who
had
extended
hospitality
to
her
ewe
lamb
for
the
moment
also
geoffrey
himself
ceased
to
be
a
dangerous
roue
and
became
a
gallant
rescuer
miraculously
appearing
on
the
scene
of
danger
she
cried
and
wanted
to
know
how
elma
looked
what
elma
said
how
elma
felt
what
elma
had
had
to
eat
if
sheets
had
been
aired
if
elma
cried
poor
darling
at
being
left
behind
and
cornelia
answered
fully
on
all
these
points
not
always
it
is
to
be
feared
with
a
strict
regard
to
veracity
but
with
a
praiseworthy
desire
to
soothe
which
was
blessed
with
wonderful
success
mrs
ramsden
dried
her
eyes
and
opined
that
life
was
full
of
blessings
and
that
she
ought
to
be
thankful
that
things
were
no
worse
there
was
a
sweet
young
girl
whom
she
had
once
known
who
had
both
legs
amputated
and
died
of
gangrene
a
month
before
she
was
to
have
been
married
it
was
caused
by
a
carriage
accident
too
and
now
she
came
to
think
of
it
the
poor
dear
had
just
the
same
complexion
as
elma
herself
well
i
guess
there
not
much
stump
about
elma
this
journey
returned
cornelia
cheerily
there
nothing
to
it
but
a
little
shock
to
the
constitootion
elma
constitootion
is
nervy
what
she
needs
is
perfect
if
i
were
you
i
send
up
a
note
and
stay
quietly
at
home
it
would
naturally
upset
her
some
to
see
you
and
she
recuperate
quicker
by
herself
but
at
this
mrs
ramsden
drew
herself
up
with
a
chilly
dignity
she
must
certainly
see
her
child
it
was
her
duty
to
see
for
herself
how
matters
progressed
in
the
matter
of
removal
she
must
be
guided
by
what
she
saw
yes
assented
cornelia
meekly
she
had
said
her
say
and
felt
confident
that
geoffrey
greville
might
now
be
trusted
to
play
his
part
as
she
walked
along
the
few
yards
which
separated
the
holt
from
the
nook
she
congratulated
herself
that
the
worst
half
of
her
explanations
were
over
but
in
this
reckoning
she
was
mistaken
miss
briskett
displeasure
was
unsoftened
by
anxiety
and
was
moreover
accentuated
by
the
remembrance
that
all
this
trouble
would
have
been
averted
if
cornelia
had
consented
to
accept
mrs
invitation
to
tea
in
a
reasonable
and
respectful
manner
the
girl
had
refused
to
make
herself
amiable
had
insisted
upon
driving
a
strange
horse
over
strange
roads
in
the
face
of
expressed
disapproval
and
had
contrived
to
come
to
grief
outside
the
very
house
of
all
others
which
she
was
most
desired
to
avoid
cornelia
was
flighty
enough
already
the
only
chance
of
keeping
her
in
order
was
by
introducing
her
to
friends
who
by
their
quiet
decorum
would
exercise
a
restraining
effect
on
her
demeanour
symptoms
of
dissatisfaction
had
already
set
in
witness
that
same
rejected
tea
and
this
afternoon
experience
had
established
a
certain
amount
of
intimacy
which
would
entail
endless
difficulties
in
the
future
poor
miss
briskett
she
was
indeed
sorely
tried
with
her
own
eyes
she
had
beheld
cornelia
driven
up
to
the
gate
by
a
man
who
was
even
more
dangerous
than
the
young
squire
himself
inasmuch
as
he
was
often
a
visitor
in
the
park
for
weeks
at
a
time
his
aunt
being
the
proud
possessor
of
the
towers
the
largest
and
most
imposing
of
the
crescent
houses
on
the
afternoon
on
which
cornelia
coming
had
first
been
discussed
she
herself
had
remarked
to
mrs
ramsden
that
the
girl
must
be
protected
from
an
acquaintance
with
captain
guest
it
seemed
almost
too
exasperating
to
be
borne
that
she
should
have
effected
an
introduction
for
herself
within
three
short
weeks
of
her
arrival
the
spinster
sharp
nose
looked
sharper
than
ever
her
thin
lips
thinner
her
grey
eyes
more
cold
and
colourless
cornelia
looked
from
them
to
the
steel
trimmings
on
her
dress
really
and
truly
one
looked
about
as
human
as
the
other
the
lonesome
feeling
gripped
once
more
and
her
thoughts
flew
longingly
to
poppar
away
at
the
other
side
of
two
thousand
miles
of
ocean
i
feel
kinder
was
the
expressive
mental
comment
as
the
maid
swept
away
the
crumbs
placed
the
two
fruit
dishes
and
the
decanter
of
port
before
her
mistress
and
noiselessly
retired
from
the
room
miss
briskett
had
been
clearing
her
throat
in
ominous
fashion
for
the
last
ten
minutes
and
now
that
mary
restraining
presence
was
removed
she
wasted
no
further
time
in
preliminaries
i
think
it
is
time
that
we
came
to
an
understanding
cornelia
she
began
in
accents
if
you
remain
under
my
roof
you
must
give
me
your
word
to
indulge
in
no
more
escapades
like
that
of
this
afternoon
i
gave
my
consent
with
much
reluctance
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
that
i
was
not
asked
for
my
consent
at
all
and
now
you
see
what
the
consequences
have
been
i
promise
faithfully
aunt
soph
that
i
never
have
a
smash
again
if
i
can
help
it
i
not
a
bit
more
set
on
them
than
you
are
yourself
and
i
guess
the
mare
was
as
innocent
as
a
babe
so
far
concerned
she
was
deliberately
setting
out
to
annoy
you
as
you
seem
to
imagine
i
guess
she
needs
more
sympathy
than
blame
do
fence
with
words
cornelia
please
i
was
not
referring
to
the
horse
and
i
have
no
intention
of
allowing
you
to
run
any
more
risks
i
distinctly
forbid
you
to
take
more
carriage
expeditions
without
a
competent
driver
i
am
responsible
for
your
safety
and
your
father
would
blame
me
if
any
harm
happened
to
you
while
you
are
my
guest
i
acted
against
my
judgment
in
allowing
you
to
go
alone
but
i
shall
not
do
so
again
do
you
clearly
understand
cornelia
golden
eyes
stared
at
her
thoughtfully
an
inherent
sense
of
justice
made
her
conscious
that
her
aunt
had
right
on
her
side
though
she
might
have
worded
her
decree
in
more
conciliatory
fashion
the
reference
to
her
father
also
had
a
softening
effect
poppar
go
crazy
if
he
heard
that
his
daughter
had
been
in
any
sort
of
danger
well
she
said
slowly
it
a
i
suppose
it
would
be
playing
it
pretty
low
down
to
land
you
with
the
worry
of
nursing
me
and
keeping
poppar
quiet
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
but
you
would
expect
me
to
drive
about
with
one
of
those
from
the
livery
stable
taking
care
of
me
as
if
i
were
a
kiddy
no
sir
i
do
see
myself
coming
down
to
level
yet
awhile
we
best
get
up
some
driving
parties
with
those
men
at
the
manor
they
seem
to
have
lots
of
horses
and
carts
and
things
hanging
round
and
i
do
see
as
they
could
employ
themselves
better
than
in
giving
elma
and
me
a
good
time
i
air
the
subject
when
i
go
up
to
inquire
miss
briskett
fairly
leapt
on
her
seat
with
horror
and
indignation
she
began
to
speak
and
spoke
rapidly
for
the
next
three
minutes
laying
down
a
series
of
commandments
to
which
cornelia
listened
with
bated
breath
thou
shalt
not
hold
any
communication
with
the
manor
nor
with
the
people
inhabiting
the
manor
nor
with
the
guest
sojourning
beneath
the
roof
of
the
manor
thou
shalt
not
associate
with
any
men
outside
the
circle
of
thy
aunt
acquaintances
thou
shalt
walk
abroad
by
thine
aunt
side
on
thine
own
legs
and
comport
thyself
discreetly
as
behoves
a
young
gentlewoman
of
good
family
thou
shalt
remember
that
thou
art
a
guest
and
conform
to
the
rules
of
the
establishment
or
else
shalt
promptly
return
to
the
place
from
whence
thou
camest
in
a
word
miss
briskett
lost
her
temper
and
when
a
woman
of
mature
years
and
grey
hairs
loses
control
of
herself
and
lets
her
tongue
run
amuck
it
is
a
sorry
spectacle
the
flush
on
cornelia
cheeks
was
not
for
her
own
humiliation
but
for
her
aunt
she
lowered
her
lids
ashamed
to
look
into
the
angry
twisted
face
yes
i
understand
she
replied
quietly
in
answer
to
the
final
question
i
guess
i
understand
quite
a
lot
and
you
mean
to
obey
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
and
then
no
drawled
cornelia
calmly
i
ca
say
as
i
do
those
people
have
been
polite
to
me
and
i
bound
to
be
civil
in
return
i
never
ran
after
any
man
that
i
know
of
and
i
do
intend
to
begin
but
when
i
meet
i
going
to
be
as
pleasant
as
i
know
how
it
a
pity
aunt
soph
but
you
do
understand
girls
i
not
been
reared
on
and
cribbage
and
i
tell
you
straight
that
i
just
to
have
a
vent
you
be
wise
not
to
try
to
shut
me
up
for
i
get
pretty
reckless
if
i
thwarted
cornelia
do
you
dare
to
threaten
me
no
aunt
soph
i
kind
enough
to
warn
you
before
it
is
too
late
cornelia
rose
as
she
spoke
and
walked
upstairs
to
the
square
prosaic
room
which
seemed
the
only
bit
of
home
she
possessed
in
the
whole
big
map
of
europe
sat
herself
down
and
reviewed
the
situation
aunt
soph
had
not
wanted
her
the
longing
for
a
real
friendship
had
been
on
one
side
only
that
was
the
first
and
most
petrifying
revelation
she
had
travelled
two
thousand
miles
to
find
herself
an
unwelcome
guest
imprisoned
within
the
four
square
walls
of
a
nook
bound
fast
in
the
trammels
of
conventions
my
country
is
of
thee
land
of
libertee
murmured
cornelia
mournfully
beneath
her
breath
two
big
tears
rose
in
her
golden
eyes
and
her
lips
quivered
should
she
pack
up
and
sail
for
home
forthwith
for
a
moment
the
temptation
seemed
irresistible
but
only
for
a
moment
poppar
would
feel
badly
if
his
two
nearest
relations
came
to
an
open
rupture
and
besides
when
i
make
up
my
mind
to
do
a
thing
i
get
there
time
said
the
girl
staunchly
i
guess
it
take
more
than
four
weeks
of
this
country
to
daunt
cornelia
e
briskett
if
she
got
her
head
set
to
stay
for
one
thing
taken
in
hand
to
start
elma
ramsden
on
the
road
to
liberty
and
going
to
be
a
fight
before
she
through
i
have
to
stand
by
and
be
ready
with
the
drill
as
for
aunt
soph
she
acted
pretty
meanly
letting
me
come
along
when
she
hated
to
have
me
but
for
poppar
sake
i
be
as
meek
as
i
know
how
i
thought
we
were
going
to
be
friends
but
she
such
a
back
number
she
do
even
remember
how
it
felt
to
be
a
girl
and
it
not
a
mite
of
use
arguing
she
thinks
she
knows
better
than
i
do
cornelia
gurgled
amused
incredulity
well
it
as
easy
as
pie
to
hev
a
little
prank
on
my
own
account
and
prank
i
if
i
to
last
out
another
three
months
in
this
secluded
seminary
my
constitootion
fed
on
excitement
i
should
wilt
away
without
it
poppar
would
like
to
have
me
wilt
she
sat
gazing
out
of
the
window
gazing
gazing
while
a
slow
smile
curled
the
corners
of
her
lips
chapter
twelve
two
golden
days
summer
sunshine
roses
lounging
chairs
set
behind
sheltering
trees
grey
eyes
eloquent
with
unspoken
vows
on
every
side
beauty
and
luxury
and
sweet
fostering
care
elma
felt
as
if
she
had
fallen
asleep
and
awakened
in
a
fairyland
more
wonderful
than
her
wildest
dreams
on
the
morning
after
the
accident
mrs
ramsden
had
duly
chartered
a
fly
and
driven
to
the
manor
with
intent
to
bring
her
daughter
home
without
delay
during
the
night
watches
old
dreads
had
revived
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
elma
left
alone
poor
innocent
darling
with
that
terrible
young
man
pursed
her
lips
at
the
recollection
of
madame
frivolities
and
decided
that
nothing
but
grimmest
necessity
should
induce
her
to
prolong
the
danger
she
entered
the
manor
a
spartan
matron
prepared
to
fight
to
the
death
for
the
rescue
of
her
child
but
behold
instead
of
a
battlefield
there
stretched
before
her
eye
a
scene
of
pastoral
simplicity
in
which
the
most
puritan
of
critics
could
not
have
discovered
an
objectionable
detail
a
wide
velvet
lawn
shaded
by
a
belt
of
grand
old
beeches
a
deck
chair
placed
in
the
most
sheltered
nook
on
which
elma
reclined
against
a
bank
of
cushions
while
beside
her
marvellous
and
confounding
sight
sat
madame
herself
turning
the
heel
of
a
common
domestic
stocking
a
mushroom
hat
hiding
the
objectionable
pompadour
so
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
there
was
not
a
man
in
sight
not
so
much
as
a
whiff
of
tobacco
smoke
in
the
air
as
the
round
black
figure
waddled
across
the
lawn
madame
rose
in
gracious
welcome
while
elma
elma
heart
began
to
beat
with
sickening
rapidity
a
mist
swam
before
her
eyes
and
a
lump
swelled
in
her
throat
she
could
not
speak
her
cheeks
turned
first
red
and
then
white
she
shook
her
head
in
response
to
her
greeting
and
gasped
as
for
breath
the
good
lady
was
distracted
at
beholding
such
symptoms
of
collapse
in
her
quiet
daughter
and
madame
reproached
herself
in
the
conviction
that
the
child
was
really
much
worse
than
she
had
imagined
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
disease
from
which
elma
was
suffering
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
pure
unadulterated
fright
fright
lest
her
mother
should
insist
upon
taking
her
home
lest
she
should
be
compelled
to
leave
the
manor
before
geoffrey
returned
from
an
excursion
carefully
timed
to
end
just
as
his
mother
drove
out
to
keep
an
appointment
in
the
town
she
was
literally
paralysed
with
fear
it
seemed
as
if
life
itself
hung
on
the
issue
of
the
next
few
moments
she
shut
her
eyes
and
listened
with
palpitating
breath
to
the
conversation
between
the
two
ladies
do
be
alarmed
it
is
just
seeing
you
that
has
upset
her
a
few
minutes
ago
she
was
quite
gay
were
you
gay
dear
we
have
had
such
a
happy
little
morning
together
so
long
as
she
is
absolutely
quiet
she
seems
quite
well
but
as
you
see
any
excitement
madame
gesticulated
eloquently
behind
elma
back
excitement
prostrates
you
does
it
dear
we
must
keep
you
quite
a
prisoner
for
the
next
few
days
mrs
ramsden
sat
down
heavily
on
a
wicker
chair
folded
her
hands
on
her
sloping
lap
and
sighed
resignedly
hardly
a
moment
had
elapsed
since
her
arrival
but
already
her
cause
was
lost
to
subject
elma
to
the
fatigue
of
returning
home
would
be
madness
when
even
an
ordinary
meeting
had
so
disastrous
effect
to
refuse
hospitality
so
charmingly
offered
would
be
ungracious
in
the
extreme
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
with
a
good
grace
and
submit
she
did
arranging
to
send
up
a
box
of
clothing
later
in
the
afternoon
and
promising
to
drive
up
again
in
a
few
days
time
a
few
days
she
wanted
to
come
every
single
morning
but
madame
sweetly
ignored
her
hints
and
elma
brightening
into
something
wonderfully
like
her
old
self
declared
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
cause
for
anxiety
i
shall
be
well
mother
dear
she
murmured
affectionately
as
the
poor
lady
stooped
to
kiss
her
before
hurrying
away
carefully
mindful
of
the
fare
of
the
waiting
fly
well
and
happy
the
pink
flamed
again
at
that
last
word
and
madame
stroked
the
soft
cheek
caressingly
that
child
is
a
picture
i
love
to
look
at
her
she
said
gushingly
as
the
two
ladies
recrossed
the
lawn
how
cruel
of
you
to
have
kept
her
to
yourself
all
this
time
really
do
you
know
i
hardly
realised
that
you
a
daughter
but
we
are
going
to
alter
all
that
we
so
sweet
of
you
to
trust
her
to
me
madame
conversation
was
a
mixture
of
questions
and
exclamations
but
she
rarely
paused
for
a
reply
she
prattled
unceasingly
as
she
saw
her
guest
into
her
fly
and
watched
her
drive
down
the
avenue
poor
old
goody
ramsden
she
was
a
worthy
old
dear
wrapped
up
in
that
child
terrified
to
move
her
yet
terrified
to
leave
her
behind
madame
smiled
in
amused
understanding
of
the
good
lady
scruples
what
duckings
and
cacklings
would
go
on
in
the
parlours
of
the
park
what
fears
and
forebodings
would
be
experienced
for
the
safety
of
the
dove
in
the
eagle
nest
out
of
a
pure
spirit
of
bravado
she
was
inclined
to
keep
the
child
as
long
as
possible
and
the
fact
of
geoffrey
obvious
admiration
only
strengthened
her
determination
it
was
dull
for
a
young
man
with
only
his
mother
in
the
house
let
him
amuse
himself
with
this
pretty
girl
a
few
days
flirtation
would
put
him
in
good
humour
and
there
was
no
danger
of
anything
serious
geoffrey
never
serious
his
flirtations
could
be
counted
by
the
score
but
they
held
no
connection
with
his
future
marriage
that
must
be
a
serious
business
arrangement
involving
a
name
a
fortune
possibly
a
title
many
tangible
qualities
would
be
demanded
from
the
future
mistress
of
the
manor
madame
went
through
life
regarding
every
person
and
thing
from
her
own
personal
standpoint
apart
from
herself
they
ceased
to
interest
she
would
be
affectionate
and
gushing
to
elma
ramsden
so
long
as
the
girl
remained
a
guest
under
her
roof
when
she
returned
to
the
holt
she
would
promptly
fade
out
of
recollection
that
a
broken
heart
might
be
among
the
impedimenta
which
she
would
carry
away
with
her
was
a
possibility
which
never
once
entered
into
the
calculation
a
typical
society
woman
verily
goody
ramsden
fears
were
not
built
without
a
foundation
an
hour
later
madame
was
driving
out
of
her
own
gates
while
geoffrey
was
installed
on
her
seat
by
the
invalid
couch
a
whole
hour
and
a
half
still
remained
before
the
gong
would
sound
the
summons
to
luncheon
an
hour
and
a
half
of
solitude
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
trees
last
night
there
had
been
another
while
madame
and
captain
guest
played
piquet
at
the
end
of
the
room
this
morning
there
had
been
yet
another
when
elma
was
first
installed
in
the
garden
and
madame
was
interviewing
her
staff
astonishing
how
intimate
two
people
can
become
in
two
long
conversations
marvellous
in
what
unison
two
separate
minds
may
move
geoffrey
and
elma
seemed
constantly
to
be
discovering
fresh
subjects
on
which
they
thought
alike
longed
alike
hoped
grieved
joyed
failed
and
fought
in
precisely
the
same
interesting
fashion
each
discovery
was
a
fresh
joy
a
fresh
surprise
do
you
really
why
so
do
i
how
strange
it
seems
in
the
garden
of
eden
these
surprises
grow
on
every
bush
elma
heart
was
hopelessly
out
of
keeping
but
conscience
still
fought
feebly
against
temptation
she
had
been
trained
to
consider
no
man
worthy
of
her
regard
who
did
not
attend
saint
nathaniel
parish
church
eschew
amusements
wear
a
blue
ribbon
in
his
coat
belong
to
the
tobacco
league
and
vote
with
the
conservative
party
in
the
watches
of
the
night
she
had
decided
that
it
was
her
duty
to
use
her
influence
to
lead
this
dear
worldling
into
better
ways
and
to
his
credit
be
it
said
the
dear
worldling
appeared
most
eager
to
be
reformed
he
besought
miss
ramsden
to
pitch
into
him
declared
that
he
knew
you
know
that
he
was
an
awful
rotter
but
represented
himself
as
waiting
eagerly
to
be
guided
in
the
way
in
which
he
should
go
how
was
he
to
begin
elma
puckered
her
delicate
eyebrows
she
was
wearing
no
hat
as
it
was
more
comfortable
to
recline
against
the
cushions
with
uncovered
head
but
a
fluffy
white
parasol
belonging
to
her
hostess
was
placed
by
her
side
in
case
an
obtrusive
sunbeam
penetrated
the
branches
overhead
i
never
know
where
the
sun
is
going
to
move
next
men
always
do
they
i
think
it
is
so
clever
of
them
madame
had
declared
in
her
charming
inconsequent
fashion
as
she
fluttered
away
elma
did
not
need
the
parasol
as
a
shade
but
it
came
in
very
usefully
as
a
plaything
in
moments
of
embarrassment
there
was
one
subject
weighing
on
her
mind
she
made
a
desperate
plunge
and
put
it
into
words
you
you
do
go
to
church
not
very
often
i
admit
i
afraid
it
is
not
much
in
my
line
do
you
believe
in
it
the
vague
question
was
yet
sufficiently
explicit
the
squire
leant
forward
his
hands
clasped
between
his
knees
his
forehead
knitted
into
thoughtful
lines
er
yes
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
once
at
college
you
know
got
into
a
set
and
chucked
the
whole
thing
aside
but
i
been
about
a
good
bit
i
seen
countries
where
they
go
on
that
tack
and
it
does
pay
the
old
way
is
the
best
i
know
i
a
bit
careless
still
men
are
miss
ramsden
when
they
have
only
themselves
to
think
of
they
get
into
the
way
of
leaving
that
sort
of
thing
to
their
mothers
and
sisters
but
when
a
fellow
starts
for
himself
it
different
i
the
master
here
in
name
but
virtually
it
my
mother
who
runs
the
house
i
do
interfere
with
her
ways
but
when
i
er
it
will
be
different
then
i
shall
make
a
stand
family
prayers
and
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
know
a
man
ought
to
set
an
example
you
are
quite
right
you
are
always
right
bit
shy
at
first
you
know
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
do
it
i
promise
you
i
would
turn
up
at
church
regularly
every
sunday
it
would
be
your
duty
said
elma
primly
she
twirled
the
handle
of
the
sunshade
round
and
round
and
strove
womanfully
to
keep
her
thoughts
fixed
on
the
subject
on
hand
and
away
from
that
thrilling
when
i
marry
but
it
is
only
you
know
she
added
anxiously
it
caring
for
it
most
of
all
and
putting
it
before
everything
else
geoffrey
gazed
at
her
in
a
rapture
of
admiration
he
loved
her
simplicity
he
adored
her
earnestness
in
his
eyes
she
was
a
shining
white
angel
sent
down
from
heaven
to
be
his
guide
through
life
it
needed
all
his
to
keep
back
the
words
which
were
struggling
for
utterance
but
the
fear
of
frightening
elma
by
a
premature
declaration
gave
him
strength
to
resist
they
turned
instead
into
a
prayer
a
sincere
yet
prayer
like
that
of
jacob
of
old
give
me
this
woman
cried
the
inner
voice
this
one
woman
out
of
all
the
world
and
i
will
vow
in
return
my
faith
my
allegiance
the
most
earnest
vows
are
often
offered
in
the
least
conventional
language
and
geoffrey
greville
was
not
a
man
to
promise
without
intending
to
perform
there
was
a
long
pregnant
silence
elma
felt
the
presence
of
electricity
in
the
air
and
forced
herself
to
return
to
the
attack
and
there
are
other
things
you
play
bridge
certainly
i
do
for
money
shilling
points
what
are
geoffrey
laughed
happily
this
innocence
sounded
fascinating
in
his
infatuated
ears
that
a
little
difficult
to
explain
is
it
if
you
do
know
anything
about
the
game
do
you
play
cards
at
all
mother
wo
have
them
in
the
house
we
have
but
they
are
different
can
you
lose
much
at
shilling
points
a
fair
amount
if
you
unlucky
but
you
can
win
it
too
i
generally
do
win
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
is
the
most
you
ever
lost
in
a
night
geoffrey
grimaced
expressively
sixty
pounds
but
i
was
a
fool
and
doubled
no
trumps
on
a
risky
hand
on
the
chance
of
making
the
rubber
that
was
quite
an
exceptional
drop
i
should
hope
so
indeed
elma
horror
was
genuinely
unassumed
sixty
pounds
why
it
more
than
many
a
poor
family
has
to
live
on
all
the
year
round
think
of
all
the
good
you
could
do
with
sixty
pounds
it
seems
awful
to
lose
it
on
cards
in
one
evening
the
next
sixty
pounds
i
win
i
give
to
a
workmen
charity
will
that
wipe
away
my
offence
elma
was
not
at
all
sure
that
it
would
money
won
in
unworthy
fashion
could
never
bring
with
it
a
blessing
according
to
mrs
theories
she
shook
her
head
sadly
and
ventured
another
question
you
go
to
races
too
do
you
whenever
i
get
the
chance
you
going
love
it
why
should
i
finest
thing
in
the
world
to
see
a
good
hard
race
wish
i
could
keep
a
stud
myself
i
would
if
i
had
the
money
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
you
see
even
if
you
are
shocked
racecourses
are
very
wicked
places
ever
seen
one
no
oh
they
looked
at
each
other
and
simultaneously
burst
into
a
laugh
they
were
young
and
in
love
it
was
delightful
to
brush
aside
problematical
difficulties
and
give
themselves
over
to
enjoyment
of
the
golden
present
elma
forgot
her
usual
somewhat
prim
reserve
and
her
laughter
was
like
a
chime
of
silver
bells
it
is
a
rare
thing
to
bear
a
musical
laugh
geoffrey
longed
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
make
her
laugh
again
i
a
born
sportsman
miss
ramsden
and
i
never
be
anything
else
i
like
to
give
up
everything
you
dislike
but
it
no
use
swearing
against
one
convictions
it
not
honest
and
it
does
last
but
i
can
promise
you
always
to
play
straight
and
to
keep
down
the
stakes
so
that
i
shall
never
run
the
risk
of
losing
so
much
again
why
ca
you
play
for
nothing
but
just
the
fun
of
the
game
we
call
that
playing
for
love
it
rather
dull
elma
twirled
her
parasol
and
blushed
to
the
eyes
chapter
thirteen
mrs
ramsden
sent
up
a
box
to
the
manor
that
same
afternoon
containing
a
dark
linen
dress
a
blue
blouse
and
black
skirt
for
evening
wear
a
supply
of
underclothing
a
grey
shetland
shawl
and
a
flannel
gown
an
hour
later
conveyed
by
special
messenger
came
a
second
box
accompanied
by
a
note
in
cornelia
handwriting
elma
was
resting
in
her
bedroom
when
it
arrived
she
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
dear
moss
rose
i
guess
tight
gowns
are
a
bit
worrying
in
hot
weather
so
i
gotten
together
a
few
waists
and
skirts
that
may
aid
your
recovery
and
send
them
along
with
my
love
wishing
you
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
if
it
is
the
right
day
it
ought
to
be
anyway
i
always
calculated
to
be
here
for
your
birthday
and
about
tired
waiting
if
you
send
them
back
i
burn
them
as
sure
as
taxes
but
i
reckon
you
too
sweet
to
hurt
my
feelings
put
on
the
one
with
the
ruckings
it
the
duty
of
every
woman
to
look
her
best
in
the
eyes
of
what
wonderful
weather
for
the
time
of
year
your
friend
cornelia
there
quite
a
gale
blowing
round
this
corner
it
sweet
of
her
but
i
must
i
ca
i
really
was
elma
comment
as
she
flushed
with
surprise
and
embarrassment
it
was
quite
certain
that
she
could
not
accept
the
gift
but
there
was
no
harm
in
just
looking
to
see
what
the
box
contained
she
crossed
the
room
cut
the
string
and
unfolded
the
brown
papers
which
covered
the
cardboard
box
lifted
fold
after
fold
of
tissue
papers
and
gasped
in
admiration
of
each
treasure
as
it
was
revealed
the
daintiest
of
white
lawn
morning
blouses
with
skirt
to
match
a
skirt
and
bodice
of
cream
net
marvellously
rucked
with
ribbons
a
blue
muslin
afoam
with
flounces
all
were
fresh
from
the
maker
hands
and
as
elma
divined
had
been
selected
from
cornelia
storehouse
of
garments
with
careful
regard
to
her
own
requirements
the
waists
would
fit
easily
enough
the
skirts
she
shook
out
the
muslin
and
held
it
against
her
own
dress
just
a
trifle
short
perhaps
but
not
sufficiently
so
to
spoil
the
effect
it
was
a
skirt
elma
edged
away
from
the
glass
with
a
little
jerk
of
the
figure
calculated
to
send
the
flounces
in
a
swirl
round
her
feet
for
years
she
had
gone
through
life
wearing
plain
hems
and
as
cornelia
predicted
the
flounces
went
to
her
brain
after
all
would
it
not
be
ungracious
to
reject
so
kindly
a
gift
her
real
birthday
fell
in
the
middle
of
july
and
cornelia
being
rich
and
generous
would
naturally
offer
a
gift
on
the
occasion
to
keep
the
blue
muslin
would
be
only
anticipating
the
remembrance
yes
she
keep
it
and
return
the
other
dresses
explaining
that
she
really
could
not
accept
so
much
but
on
second
thoughts
cornelia
had
specially
desired
her
to
wear
the
net
with
the
ruckings
elma
dropped
the
muslin
on
the
bed
lifted
the
net
blouse
carefully
from
its
wrappings
and
held
it
before
her
to
view
the
effect
had
mortal
hands
fashioned
it
or
had
it
dropped
down
from
a
fairyland
where
good
spirits
gathered
pieces
of
cloud
and
and
blew
them
together
for
the
benefit
of
happy
girlhood
elma
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
looked
back
at
the
blue
glace
silk
and
black
surah
on
the
bed
and
thanked
heaven
for
cornelia
briskett
indeed
and
indeed
she
would
wear
the
rucked
net
and
look
her
best
in
the
eyes
of
and
she
would
send
back
the
white
lawn
and
say
should
she
say
perhaps
after
all
it
would
seem
rather
queer
to
keep
the
two
more
elaborate
gowns
and
send
back
the
simplest
it
might
appear
as
if
she
did
not
consider
it
worthy
of
acceptance
she
would
keep
them
all
wear
them
all
enjoy
them
all
and
oh
dear
sweet
kind
and
most
understanding
cornelia
if
ever
ever
the
time
arrived
when
the
gift
could
be
returned
with
what
a
full
heart
should
it
be
offered
pen
ink
and
paper
lay
ready
on
the
elma
seated
herself
and
wrote
her
thanks
you
dear
at
first
i
thought
i
could
but
tried
on
all
three
and
i
simply
part
from
them
i
do
know
what
mother
will
say
but
i
living
just
for
the
hour
i
going
to
wear
the
net
and
if
i
look
my
best
it
will
be
doing
and
i
never
forget
it
it
just
wonderful
up
here
but
i
feel
wicked
for
really
and
truly
i
not
ill
captain
guest
asked
me
a
hundred
questions
about
you
last
night
and
i
told
him
such
nice
things
cornelia
i
wonder
sometimes
whether
you
are
a
witch
and
upset
the
cart
on
purpose
but
of
course
there
the
parrot
madame
is
most
kind
but
i
do
really
her
a
scrap
better
than
the
moment
we
arrived
she
wears
lovely
clothes
if
it
were
not
for
you
i
should
have
to
go
downstairs
in
an
odd
blouse
and
skirt
and
feel
a
i
hope
you
come
up
to
inquire
come
soon
everyone
wants
to
see
you
again
with
a
hundred
your
loving
friend
elma
why
am
i
a
rose
the
note
was
slipped
into
the
in
the
hall
as
elma
went
down
to
dinner
that
night
lovely
to
behold
in
the
rucked
gown
and
the
perusal
of
it
next
morning
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
episodes
which
cornelia
had
known
since
her
arrival
truth
to
tell
she
had
felt
many
doubts
as
to
the
reception
of
her
fineries
but
the
mental
vision
of
elma
tasteless
garments
against
the
background
of
the
beautiful
old
manor
had
been
distressing
enough
to
overcome
her
scruples
she
dimpled
as
she
read
and
laughed
triumphantly
things
were
going
well
excellently
well
and
those
dresses
ought
to
exercise
a
distinctly
hurrying
effect
four
or
five
days
maybe
a
week
my
soliloquised
cornelia
happily
i
recollect
one
little
misery
who
proposed
to
me
at
the
end
of
an
afternoon
picnic
they
slower
over
here
but
mr
greville
was
pretty
well
started
before
this
spell
began
and
if
he
the
man
i
take
him
for
he
wo
last
out
a
whole
week
with
elma
among
the
roses
then
the
fun
will
begin
sakes
alive
what
a
and
how
will
the
rose
stand
pickling
that
where
i
come
to
a
full
stop
i
ca
surmise
one
mite
which
way
she
turn
but
she
got
to
reckon
with
cornelia
e
briskett
if
she
caves
in
miss
briskett
did
not
vouchsafe
any
inquiry
as
to
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
had
afforded
such
obvious
satisfaction
she
had
probably
recognised
elma
writing
on
the
envelope
but
made
no
inquiries
as
to
her
progress
relationships
between
the
aunt
and
niece
were
still
a
trifle
strained
that
is
to
say
they
were
strained
on
miss
side
cornelia
knack
of
relapsing
into
her
natural
manner
on
the
very
heels
of
a
heated
altercation
seemed
somehow
an
additional
offence
since
it
placed
one
under
the
imputation
of
being
sulky
whereas
of
course
one
was
exhibiting
only
a
dignified
reserve
miss
briskett
set
forth
on
her
morning
shopping
expedition
without
requesting
her
niece
to
accompany
her
an
omission
which
she
fondly
hoped
would
be
taken
to
heart
but
the
hardened
criminal
regarding
the
retreating
figure
from
behind
the
curtains
simply
ejaculated
praise
the
fates
swung
her
feet
on
to
the
sofa
and
settled
herself
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
novel
hired
from
the
circulating
library
round
the
corner
for
a
solid
hour
she
read
on
undisturbed
then
the
door
opened
and
mason
entered
carrying
a
telegram
upon
a
silver
salver
for
you
miss
the
boy
is
waiting
for
an
answer
cornelia
tore
open
the
envelope
with
the
haste
of
one
separated
far
from
her
dearest
took
in
the
contents
in
a
lightning
glance
sighed
with
relief
and
slowly
broke
into
a
smile
well
she
drawled
thoughtfully
well
yes
there
is
an
answer
mason
give
me
a
pencil
from
that
rack
she
scribbled
two
or
three
words
copied
an
address
and
handed
it
back
eagerly
there
give
that
to
the
boy
and
see
here
mason
i
shall
want
some
lunch
ready
by
half
after
twelve
send
mury
right
along
to
my
room
i
going
away
mason
chin
dropped
in
dismay
but
she
was
too
an
automaton
to
put
her
feelings
into
words
she
rustled
starchily
from
the
room
to
give
the
dread
message
to
mary
who
promptly
flew
upstairs
voluble
with
distress
you
never
mean
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
leave
us
miss
cornelia
why
you
only
just
come
i
thought
it
was
to
be
three
months
at
the
least
you
never
going
so
soon
only
for
a
few
days
i
be
back
again
to
plague
you
by
the
end
of
next
week
do
you
want
me
to
go
mury
mary
shook
her
head
vigourously
i
like
to
keep
you
for
ever
the
house
is
the
same
place
since
you
came
i
was
saying
to
my
friend
only
last
sunday
that
i
could
a
bear
to
think
of
you
leaving
could
you
find
a
nice
young
gentleman
and
settle
down
in
england
for
good
i
come
and
live
with
you
i
would
ask
anything
better
than
to
live
with
you
all
my
days
mury
mury
what
about
the
friend
what
would
he
say
to
such
desertion
mary
grimace
expressed
a
lively
disregard
of
the
friend
sufferings
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
i
think
a
heap
more
of
you
nor
i
do
of
him
she
confessed
candidly
i
come
fast
enough
if
you
gave
me
the
chance
there
lots
of
young
gentlemen
in
england
miss
cornelia
is
that
so
i
hope
i
meet
quite
a
number
of
them
then
but
i
could
settle
down
out
of
my
own
country
mury
you
hev
to
cross
the
ocean
if
you
want
to
tend
my
house
we
speak
about
that
another
day
just
now
we
got
to
hustle
round
and
get
my
clothes
packed
in
the
next
hef
hour
just
the
dandiest
things
i
got
i
going
to
have
a
real
gay
time
in
a
hotel
in
london
mury
with
some
friends
from
home
so
i
must
be
as
smart
as
i
know
how
get
out
the
big
dress
basket
and
we
hold
a
selection
committee
right
here
on
the
bed
mary
set
to
work
unable
despite
depression
to
restrain
her
interest
in
the
work
on
hand
the
big
boxes
were
dragged
into
the
middle
of
the
room
bed
chairs
and
sofas
were
strewn
with
garments
until
the
room
presented
the
appearance
of
a
general
drapery
establishment
cornelia
selected
and
directed
mary
carefully
folded
up
skirts
and
laid
them
in
the
long
shallow
shelves
in
the
height
of
the
confusion
the
door
opened
and
miss
briskett
entered
with
hasty
step
signs
of
agitation
were
visible
on
her
features
an
agitation
which
was
increased
by
the
sight
of
the
dishevelled
room
in
a
lightning
glance
she
took
in
the
trunks
the
trim
travelling
costume
spread
over
the
chair
by
the
and
a
gleam
of
something
strangely
like
fear
shone
out
of
the
cold
grey
eyes
cornelia
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
that
look
aunt
soph
was
afraid
she
had
pulled
the
rope
just
a
trifle
too
tight
and
that
it
was
snapping
before
her
eyes
she
was
picturing
a
flight
back
to
america
and
envisaging
her
brother
disappointment
and
wrath
out
of
the
abundance
of
her
own
content
the
girl
vouchsafed
a
generous
compassion
yes
i
off
aunt
soph
my
friends
the
moffatts
are
putting
up
at
the
ritz
for
a
week
and
want
to
have
me
come
and
fly
round
with
them
they
are
going
to
meet
me
at
four
this
afternoon
to
be
ready
for
a
theatre
i
got
to
be
off
at
once
mason
getting
ready
some
lunch
miss
briskett
stood
severely
erect
considering
the
situation
now
that
the
great
anxiety
was
removed
the
former
irritation
revived
and
pray
who
are
the
moffatts
i
must
know
something
more
about
them
before
i
can
give
my
consent
to
this
visit
cornelia
handed
a
pile
of
cardboard
boxes
into
mary
hands
take
that
downstairs
and
pack
these
on
the
tray
do
muss
them
about
then
you
can
come
back
to
finish
off
she
waited
until
the
door
was
safely
closed
then
faced
her
aunt
across
the
bed
i
pleased
to
answer
your
questions
as
well
as
i
know
how
the
moffatts
are
the
moffatts
i
guess
that
about
all
their
family
history
so
far
as
i
concerned
they
came
over
with
me
and
mrs
moffatt
was
real
kind
looking
after
me
when
i
first
came
on
deck
and
was
feeling
pretty
cheap
we
saw
quite
a
good
deal
of
each
other
after
that
and
she
said
she
love
to
have
me
do
the
sights
with
her
sometime
she
was
going
straight
through
to
paris
to
get
fixed
up
with
clothes
now
it
seems
she
back
in
london
i
gave
her
my
address
and
she
wires
me
to
come
you
spoke
of
moffatts
who
are
the
other
members
of
the
party
there
a
husband
of
course
but
he
not
much
account
except
to
pay
the
bills
he
must
be
pretty
cashy
for
she
has
everything
she
wants
but
it
gets
on
her
nerves
having
him
poking
round
all
the
while
one
reason
why
she
wants
me
i
could
always
keep
him
quiet
the
complacent
gurgle
the
jaunty
tilt
of
the
head
were
as
fuel
to
the
spinster
indignation
she
pressed
her
lips
tightly
together
before
putting
the
final
question
and
your
father
knows
nothing
nothing
whatever
of
these
people
well
i
guess
i
may
have
mentioned
their
names
he
did
know
anything
about
them
before
that
and
you
propose
to
stay
at
a
london
hotel
with
the
casual
acquaintances
of
a
few
days
you
are
mad
i
can
not
possibly
allow
it
you
must
wire
at
once
to
say
that
you
are
unable
to
accept
cornelia
stood
silently
erect
her
chief
personal
characteristic
was
that
air
of
fragility
so
often
seen
in
american
girls
but
in
that
silence
her
chin
squared
her
lips
set
the
delicate
brows
contracted
in
a
beetling
frown
it
was
no
longer
the
face
of
a
girl
of
which
confronted
the
spinster
across
the
bed
it
was
the
face
of
edward
b
briskett
the
financier
who
had
twice
over
piled
up
great
fortunes
by
sheer
force
and
determination
now
see
here
aunt
soph
said
cornelia
clearly
this
is
where
you
and
i
have
got
to
come
to
an
understanding
i
been
used
to
going
my
own
way
ever
since
i
was
and
it
was
hankering
to
be
put
back
into
that
brought
me
across
the
ocean
poppar
trusts
me
and
that
enough
for
me
you
got
a
right
to
boss
your
own
home
but
where
i
concerned
your
authority
do
spread
one
inch
beyond
the
gate
if
i
decide
to
accept
an
invitation
it
on
my
own
responsibility
and
no
matter
what
happens
wo
be
blamed
decided
to
leave
this
at
one
and
i
to
leave
if
i
have
to
jump
out
of
the
window
to
get
away
now
that
straight
and
we
know
where
we
are
i
shall
write
to
your
father
and
tell
him
that
you
have
gone
in
defiance
of
my
wishes
i
guess
it
the
best
thing
you
can
do
poppar
cable
back
corney
her
head
it
screwed
on
pretty
and
you
feel
easier
in
your
mind
she
paused
a
moment
her
features
softened
into
a
smile
despite
the
force
of
her
words
there
had
throughout
been
no
trace
of
in
her
voice
now
she
drew
slowly
nearer
her
aunt
holding
out
her
pretty
white
hands
in
ingratiating
appeal
see
here
aunt
soph
do
be
mad
i
sorry
you
take
it
like
this
for
i
a
feeling
that
it
just
about
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
both
of
us
for
me
to
clear
out
for
a
spell
just
now
we
been
a
bit
fratchetty
this
last
week
gotten
on
each
other
nerves
somehow
but
when
i
come
back
we
can
make
a
fresh
start
in
america
girls
have
more
liberty
than
over
here
but
there
not
a
mite
of
reason
why
we
should
quarrel
over
it
you
my
own
poppar
sister
and
i
came
quite
a
good
way
to
see
you
it
a
pity
if
we
ke
pull
it
off
for
the
next
few
months
do
you
want
to
kiss
me
and
wish
me
a
real
good
time
miss
briskett
drew
back
coldly
but
the
little
hands
clasped
her
shoulder
the
young
face
pressed
nearer
and
nearer
looking
down
from
her
superior
stature
the
girl
likeness
to
her
father
was
once
more
strikingly
apparent
but
it
was
not
the
man
she
recalled
but
the
dearer
memory
of
the
baby
edward
of
long
ago
whose
clear
child
eyes
had
seen
in
sister
the
most
marvellous
of
created
things
as
on
a
former
occasion
the
remembrance
was
more
powerful
than
words
long
years
of
solitary
confinement
had
hardened
the
spinster
heart
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
gracious
capitulation
but
at
least
she
submitted
to
the
girl
embrace
and
made
no
further
objections
to
the
proposed
journey
on
the
whole
cornelia
felt
that
she
had
scored
a
victory
chapter
fourteen
cornelia
booked
a
return
to
town
scattered
broadcast
among
the
astonished
porters
ensconced
herself
in
a
corner
of
an
empty
carriage
and
prepared
to
enjoy
the
journey
she
did
not
purchase
any
magazines
at
the
bookstall
the
only
child
of
a
millionaire
need
not
trouble
about
insurance
coupons
and
at
life
is
more
interesting
than
fiction
cornelia
guessed
she
heaps
more
to
think
about
than
would
occupy
a
pokey
little
journey
of
from
two
or
three
hours
just
to
think
how
things
changed
from
day
to
day
yesterday
she
had
supposed
herself
dumped
in
norton
park
for
a
solid
three
months
and
here
she
was
full
chase
for
london
with
the
prospect
of
a
week
crammed
full
of
frivolity
and
amusement
she
gurgled
to
herself
in
much
contentment
aunt
soph
had
kissed
her
or
at
least
submitted
to
be
kissed
elma
was
engaged
in
playing
the
part
of
eve
in
flounced
blue
muslin
to
an
adam
in
a
flannel
suit
in
a
particularly
garden
of
eden
she
could
therefore
be
happy
in
her
mind
concerning
those
who
were
left
behind
and
she
had
never
yet
doubted
her
own
ability
to
take
care
of
herself
she
smoothed
the
wrinkles
on
her
long
suede
gloves
flicked
the
dust
off
the
ridiculous
points
of
her
high
shoes
and
sighed
impatiently
she
and
her
baggage
were
safely
aboard
why
could
that
old
engine
hustle
up
and
start
cornelia
rose
to
her
feet
and
thrust
her
head
out
of
the
open
window
there
was
only
one
passenger
approaching
along
the
deserted
platform
and
as
fate
would
have
it
he
had
reached
a
spot
but
a
couple
of
yards
away
so
that
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
girl
head
through
the
window
was
followed
by
simultaneous
exclamations
of
astonishment
exclamations
of
recognition
too
for
the
was
none
other
than
captain
guest
himself
most
obviously
equipped
for
town
miss
briskett
is
that
you
mussy
what
a
turn
you
gave
me
who
have
dreamt
of
meeting
you
here
are
you
going
up
to
town
i
am
are
you
i
am
do
you
prefer
to
travel
alone
if
not
may
i
come
in
why
suttenly
cornelia
was
not
yet
quite
sure
whether
she
were
annoyed
or
pleased
by
the
encounter
but
on
the
whole
the
agreeable
element
predominated
she
was
of
a
gregarious
nature
and
at
any
time
preferred
to
talk
rather
than
remain
silent
after
a
month
spent
in
a
strictly
feminine
household
the
society
of
a
male
man
was
an
agreeable
novelty
moreover
sweet
triumph
to
a
daughter
of
eve
half
an
on
the
drive
home
from
the
manor
had
apparently
made
short
work
of
the
captain
preconceived
dislike
since
he
was
so
anxious
to
repeat
the
dose
cornelia
smiled
the
naughty
little
smile
of
a
spider
who
welcomes
a
fly
into
his
net
another
minute
and
the
train
was
movings
lowly
out
of
the
station
while
the
two
young
people
continued
their
confronting
each
other
from
their
separate
corners
this
is
an
unexpected
visit
is
it
not
i
understood
from
miss
ramsden
that
she
expected
you
to
call
at
the
manor
or
cornelia
scored
a
point
against
him
for
his
own
desertion
in
the
face
of
so
interesting
a
prospect
vury
unexpected
i
got
a
wire
from
a
friend
and
came
off
within
two
hours
i
understood
from
mrs
greville
that
were
making
quite
a
good
stay
guest
grimaced
eloquently
i
was
but
circumstances
alter
cases
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
miss
briskett
i
just
a
bit
fed
up
with
playing
gooseberry
by
day
and
piquet
with
madame
by
night
and
the
idea
of
spending
a
few
days
at
the
club
presented
itself
as
an
agreeable
novelty
my
friends
are
almost
all
in
town
just
now
and
there
is
a
good
deal
going
on
i
generally
put
in
a
week
or
so
of
the
season
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
clear
out
at
once
they
do
want
me
here
i
do
know
about
that
returned
cornelia
thoughtfully
what
about
madame
got
to
keep
her
occupied
what
to
happen
to
her
in
the
evenings
now
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
a
game
and
that
the
limit
if
you
been
a
kind
friend
you
have
stayed
on
and
worked
that
piquet
for
all
you
were
worth
but
i
not
you
see
captain
guest
explained
and
in
truth
he
did
not
look
it
cornelia
glance
took
in
the
magnificent
proportions
of
the
man
the
indefinable
air
of
birth
and
breeding
the
faultless
toilette
the
strong
dark
features
to
one
and
all
she
paid
a
tribute
of
admiration
but
the
expression
on
the
face
was
of
concentrated
at
this
point
admiration
stopped
dead
to
be
replaced
by
an
uneasy
dread
was
geoffrey
greville
even
as
his
friend
frankly
indifferent
to
everything
but
his
own
amusement
and
if
so
what
of
poor
elma
and
her
dream
it
was
an
awful
reflection
that
in
such
a
case
she
herself
would
be
largely
responsible
for
thrusting
elma
into
danger
her
expression
clouded
and
she
stared
through
the
window
with
unseeing
eyes
captain
guest
words
had
been
so
exceedingly
plain
that
she
had
not
affected
to
misunderstand
their
meaning
and
the
ice
once
broken
she
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
solving
her
doubts
you
know
mr
greville
very
well
is
he
a
flirt
captain
guest
flashed
a
glance
at
her
a
rapid
understanding
glance
he
has
been
he
replied
quietly
a
desperate
flirt
but
he
is
not
flirting
now
you
think
i
sure
cornelia
clasped
her
hands
with
a
sigh
of
relief
then
the
deluge
you
mean
he
ca
marry
her
of
course
she
a
lovely
girl
and
everything
that
nice
and
good
and
that
kind
of
thing
but
not
at
all
the
kind
of
girl
he
ought
to
marry
ought
he
to
marry
someone
hideous
then
with
an
ugly
temper
poor
fellow
why
there
no
necessity
to
be
hideous
that
i
know
of
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
probably
wo
find
a
girl
suitable
as
to
means
and
position
who
is
anything
like
so
attractive
personally
as
miss
ramsden
greville
is
hardly
his
own
master
miss
briskett
he
is
not
a
rich
man
and
he
has
the
place
to
think
of
besides
there
madame
to
consider
madame
belongs
to
a
noble
house
and
has
high
ideas
for
her
son
is
it
the
custom
over
here
for
the
mommas
to
choose
wives
for
their
sons
i
do
know
much
about
mr
greville
but
from
the
look
of
him
i
should
suppose
he
was
one
of
that
sort
he
has
a
kind
of
an
air
as
if
he
want
a
lot
of
moving
once
he
got
his
head
set
if
he
really
cares
captain
guest
shrugged
expressively
oh
for
the
moment
of
course
it
a
case
of
for
love
and
the
world
well
lost
but
in
a
few
days
time
miss
ramsden
will
return
home
they
will
drop
out
of
each
other
lives
and
then
prudence
will
come
to
the
fore
there
a
girl
whom
he
has
known
for
years
who
is
built
for
him
all
the
way
round
i
do
say
he
like
it
so
much
but
he
end
by
marrying
her
like
a
good
boy
by
marrying
her
money
you
mean
to
say
i
see
we
americans
are
the
only
mercenary
nation
in
the
world
though
we
get
the
credit
for
it
sometimes
well
i
wait
a
while
before
i
judge
there
comes
a
time
in
most
men
lives
when
they
forget
their
fine
principles
and
see
just
one
thing
ahead
they
got
to
have
everything
else
goes
down
like
ninepins
even
if
it
a
real
stately
old
mother
with
her
hair
like
marie
antoinette
we
wait
and
see
if
that
time
comes
along
for
mr
greville
guest
lip
twitched
with
amusement
you
seem
to
be
very
experienced
on
the
subject
i
am
so
i
seen
quite
a
good
deal
of
life
said
cornelia
with
the
air
of
a
female
methuselah
she
did
not
smirk
nor
giggle
at
the
insinuation
but
accepted
it
placidly
as
a
matter
of
course
an
occurrence
of
everyday
happening
guest
studied
her
critically
as
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
was
she
plain
or
beautiful
it
was
difficult
to
say
the
colourless
complexion
and
sharply
pointed
nose
were
serious
blemishes
but
the
mouth
was
exquisite
and
the
hair
a
marvel
how
rossetti
would
have
gloried
in
painting
it
unbound
with
the
great
waves
floating
over
her
shoulders
the
eyes
were
good
too
despite
their
unusual
colour
the
colour
of
a
tawny
old
sherry
as
though
attracted
by
his
scrutiny
cornelia
turned
her
head
and
let
the
golden
eyes
dwell
thoughtfully
upon
his
face
does
mr
greville
do
anything
she
inquired
has
he
any
sort
of
occupation
in
life
he
has
a
certain
amount
of
business
in
connection
with
the
property
but
the
agent
does
most
of
that
he
hunts
of
course
and
shoots
a
capital
shot
and
fishes
at
odd
times
all
the
ordinary
things
that
a
man
does
is
that
so
they
would
be
ordinary
with
us
i
like
a
man
to
work
got
to
work
hard
i
suppose
you
a
soldier
the
quick
pucker
of
lips
and
brows
were
almost
startlingly
eloquent
of
pain
not
now
i
was
you
retired
yes
why
rupert
guest
looked
across
the
carriage
in
silence
at
any
time
he
was
haughtily
resentful
of
curiosity
but
on
this
subject
most
of
all
he
could
not
endure
to
speak
with
his
most
intimate
friends
his
first
impulse
was
to
ignore
the
question
but
as
he
met
cornelia
steady
eyes
that
impulse
underwent
an
extraordinary
reversion
incredible
as
it
might
appear
he
became
conscious
that
it
was
not
only
possible
that
he
could
tell
this
girl
this
stranger
the
hidden
sorrow
of
his
life
but
that
he
actually
wished
to
tell
it
he
wanted
to
hear
what
she
would
say
to
see
how
she
would
look
those
childlike
eyes
would
look
very
beautiful
softened
with
the
light
of
sympathy
and
consolation
he
wanted
to
see
that
light
shining
for
his
sake
it
a
long
story
he
began
slowly
i
do
talk
of
it
more
than
i
can
help
but
i
tell
you
if
you
care
to
hear
it
i
come
of
a
race
of
soldiers
it
never
entered
my
head
that
i
could
be
anything
else
my
father
was
in
the
lancers
he
died
before
i
left
sandhurst
but
my
mother
managed
to
allow
me
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
i
joined
my
father
regiment
i
was
lucky
as
things
go
went
through
two
engagements
before
i
was
thirty
gained
distinction
at
omdurman
at
home
i
had
a
nailing
good
time
adjutant
of
the
regiment
we
had
the
jolliest
mess
i
do
think
a
man
ever
lived
who
enjoyed
his
life
more
there
was
lots
of
play
but
i
loved
the
work
too
and
studied
hard
at
every
branch
of
the
profession
i
had
the
credit
of
being
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
service
he
laughed
a
hard
hearted
laugh
i
can
say
that
now
without
reproach
for
it
belongs
to
another
life
then
my
mother
died
she
had
been
living
beyond
her
income
and
there
were
all
the
legal
expenses
to
face
selling
up
at
a
loss
giving
the
girls
their
share
she
had
made
a
special
push
to
keep
me
in
the
old
regiment
but
in
the
end
it
came
down
to
this
that
in
all
there
was
barely
five
hundred
a
year
for
me
it
was
a
big
blow
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
send
in
my
resignation
why
one
ca
be
an
officer
in
a
crack
cavalry
regiment
with
only
five
hundred
a
year
beyond
his
pay
miss
briskett
it
ca
be
done
there
was
one
of
my
subs
who
had
less
than
eight
hundred
do
you
get
any
pay
at
all
in
your
army
then
certainly
about
enough
to
pay
the
mess
bills
and
perhaps
the
changes
of
kit
the
uniform
costs
several
hundreds
to
start
with
and
those
fools
at
the
war
office
are
everlastingly
ordering
senseless
alterations
yes
but
i
do
understand
if
the
pay
is
enough
for
your
keep
why
do
you
need
such
a
heap
more
to
get
along
where
does
all
the
expense
come
in
guest
knitted
his
brows
in
momentary
embarrassment
well
of
course
there
are
certain
things
that
a
man
must
do
to
live
up
to
his
position
he
must
entertain
he
must
hunt
he
must
play
polo
it
comes
cheaper
to
him
than
ordinary
men
for
he
has
the
use
of
the
regimental
stables
but
still
things
run
up
it
astonishing
how
they
run
up
there
are
a
hundred
things
that
are
of
him
and
there
no
getting
away
from
them
is
he
expected
first
thing
of
all
to
serve
his
country
that
is
of
course
guest
raised
his
head
proudly
i
have
already
explained
that
i
served
her
would
they
let
you
go
on
then
because
you
could
cut
a
dash
me
there
was
a
man
in
the
mess
who
did
beg
me
to
stay
on
the
duke
sent
for
me
and
argued
for
half
an
hour
he
promised
me
a
staff
appointment
he
said
some
awfully
decent
things
about
my
past
services
i
was
glad
of
that
i
said
no
good
sir
i
face
the
prospect
of
being
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
not
being
able
to
afford
as
much
as
my
own
subs
we
went
over
it
again
and
again
and
he
lost
his
temper
at
last
and
called
me
a
fool
but
i
stuck
to
it
cornelia
drew
a
sharp
breath
of
excitement
you
resign
for
money
in
spite
of
all
for
only
that
it
a
very
big
miss
briskett
you
do
know
how
it
feels
to
have
your
income
suddenly
reduced
by
oh
do
i
just
i
know
how
it
feels
to
have
it
wiped
clean
away
i
guess
my
poppar
dropped
about
as
much
in
one
slump
as
any
man
in
the
states
cried
cornelia
with
the
true
american
pride
in
size
be
it
for
good
or
she
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
state
that
the
lost
fortune
had
been
more
than
retrieved
for
one
of
the
very
few
points
on
which
she
found
herself
in
complete
agreement
with
her
aunt
was
the
suppression
of
her
own
wealth
she
had
no
wish
to
be
judged
from
a
monetary
standpoint
and
poppar
fame
had
not
travelled
across
the
ocean
he
was
just
an
ordinary
everyday
millionaire
with
a
modest
little
income
of
from
three
to
four
hundred
a
day
not
a
real
genuine
with
a
thousand
an
hour
i
had
to
give
up
my
frills
and
fixings
but
i
held
on
like
grim
death
to
the
things
that
i
guess
there
something
wrong
about
your
army
if
a
man
got
to
have
a
fortune
before
he
can
be
an
officer
a
good
many
people
are
with
you
there
miss
briskett
but
unfortunately
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
then
what
did
you
do
after
that
cleared
out
i
sold
my
uniform
for
eighty
pounds
he
laughed
again
the
same
sore
laugh
and
gave
my
orderly
about
a
dozen
suits
of
ordinary
clothes
the
only
thing
i
kept
was
my
sword
i
had
ten
swords
hung
on
my
walls
used
by
ten
generations
in
succession
i
could
give
that
up
an
old
chum
was
going
out
ranching
to
the
wildest
part
of
california
he
asked
me
to
come
with
him
and
i
jumped
at
it
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
country
away
from
it
all
if
i
seen
the
regiment
riding
through
the
streets
i
should
have
gone
mad
we
sailed
within
a
few
weeks
cornelia
face
was
eloquent
with
meaning
she
had
seen
a
regiment
of
lancers
riding
through
the
streets
of
london
on
the
one
day
which
she
had
spent
in
the
metropolis
had
stood
to
stare
mouthed
even
as
the
crowd
who
thronged
the
pavement
she
recalled
the
figure
of
the
officer
a
gorgeous
mediaeval
knight
impenetrably
lifeless
sitting
astride
his
high
horse
like
a
figure
of
bronze
a
glimpse
of
haughty
set
features
visible
between
cap
and
outwardly
immovable
indifferent
but
within
ah
within
beyond
a
doubt
a
swelling
pride
in
himself
in
his
men
in
the
noble
animals
which
bore
them
in
the
consciousness
that
every
day
the
pageant
attracted
the
same
meed
of
admiration
pride
in
the
consciousness
that
he
represented
his
king
his
empire
the
power
of
the
sword
cornelia
a
stranger
and
a
republican
had
thrilled
at
the
sight
of
the
gallant
lancers
and
she
had
visited
the
wilds
of
california
also
and
had
received
hospitality
at
a
lonely
ranch
there
was
a
husky
note
in
her
voice
as
she
spoke
again
how
long
were
you
there
three
years
did
you
hate
it
very
much
the
laugh
this
time
was
more
strangled
than
before
twice
over
i
came
within
an
inch
of
shooting
myself
we
were
twenty
miles
from
the
nearest
neighbour
my
friend
went
his
way
i
went
mine
for
days
together
we
hardly
exchanged
a
word
there
was
nothing
but
the
great
stretch
of
land
and
the
rockies
in
the
distance
in
time
one
gets
to
think
them
beautiful
but
at
first
i
used
to
sit
and
think
of
home
and
the
regiment
it
was
with
me
i
used
to
say
to
myself
they
are
at
mess
now
the
horses
are
coming
out
of
the
stables
now
they
are
turning
out
for
polo
i
could
hear
the
drum
and
the
reveille
and
the
last
post
as
clearly
as
in
the
barracks
at
home
i
heard
them
he
stopped
short
turning
his
eyes
from
the
window
to
look
at
face
it
was
distorted
quivering
with
emotion
her
hands
were
clasped
together
and
down
her
cheek
rolled
two
unashamed
he
turned
sharply
aside
and
for
some
moments
neither
spoke
cornelia
was
seeing
as
in
a
picture
the
lonely
ranch
with
the
solitary
figure
sitting
with
his
face
towards
the
east
thinking
thinking
guest
was
reflecting
with
amaze
on
the
strange
antic
of
fate
which
ordained
that
it
should
be
in
the
eyes
of
this
yankee
stranger
that
he
should
see
the
first
woman
tears
shed
on
his
behalf
she
cried
like
a
child
simply
involuntarily
without
thought
of
appearance
the
tears
rising
from
a
pure
well
of
sympathy
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
would
bless
her
for
those
tears
the
train
slackened
and
drew
up
at
a
country
station
a
stout
elderly
lady
approached
the
carriage
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
occupants
and
hastily
moved
on
cornelia
smiled
with
the
tears
wet
on
her
lashes
again
the
wheels
began
to
move
and
guest
said
shortly
thank
you
for
your
sympathy
i
had
a
feeling
that
you
would
understand
that
why
i
told
you
it
not
a
story
that
i
often
tell
to
strangers
as
you
may
guess
my
yes
i
sympathise
i
should
just
think
i
do
i
know
what
even
our
own
people
suffer
sometimes
away
out
west
but
i
do
said
cornelia
firmly
i
do
understand
one
little
bit
more
to
soldiering
than
riding
through
the
streets
looking
fine
and
large
and
gotten
up
like
a
show
i
love
to
see
it
we
profess
to
laugh
at
forms
and
ceremonies
but
we
love
them
just
the
same
as
anybody
else
but
it
was
your
you
promise
to
serve
for
better
or
worse
you
allowed
you
were
sworn
to
serve
her
you
had
risked
your
life
for
her
i
reckon
you
had
shed
your
blood
there
was
just
one
thing
you
would
sacrifice
your
own
pride
you
were
thinking
of
when
you
sent
in
that
resignation
captain
guest
you
saw
yourself
sitting
looking
out
of
the
window
and
seeing
the
boys
riding
off
to
their
sports
and
leaving
you
behind
you
cared
more
for
that
than
the
thought
that
england
might
need
you
you
hit
hard
miss
briskett
i
hit
straight
i
know
just
how
you
suffered
seems
to
me
going
to
remember
all
my
life
how
you
sat
in
that
ranch
and
heard
the
last
post
but
if
i
been
in
your
place
if
america
had
wanted
me
her
small
white
face
lit
up
with
a
very
ecstasy
of
emotion
i
have
stayed
at
my
post
i
had
to
sweep
the
floors
to
do
chapter
fifteen
the
moment
of
tension
passed
and
the
strain
relaxed
captain
guest
stoutly
defended
his
position
and
cornelia
vouchsafed
a
generous
sympathy
while
not
budging
an
inch
from
her
ultimate
decision
she
disapproved
but
she
had
wept
the
tears
had
rolled
unchecked
down
her
cheeks
on
his
behalf
after
that
they
could
no
longer
be
mere
casual
acquaintances
by
the
end
of
the
first
hour
they
had
left
the
personal
element
behind
and
were
chatting
busily
about
a
dozen
varying
subjects
the
english
landscape
trusts
free
trade
miss
alice
roosevelt
chafing
dishes
and
the
london
season
cornelia
had
a
opinion
on
each
and
was
satisfied
that
every
one
who
did
not
agree
with
her
was
a
back
number
but
her
arguments
and
illustrations
were
so
apt
and
humorous
that
guest
was
abundantly
entertained
throughout
the
entire
journey
their
was
uninterrupted
for
though
several
passengers
approached
the
carriage
with
intent
to
enter
one
and
all
followed
the
example
of
the
stout
lady
and
dropped
the
handle
at
sight
of
the
two
occupants
the
third
time
that
this
interesting
little
pantomime
was
enacted
cornelia
laughed
aloud
and
cried
serenely
guess
they
think
we
a
honeymoon
couple
they
so
scared
of
getting
in
beside
us
her
colour
showed
not
the
faintest
variation
as
she
spoke
it
was
guest
who
grew
hot
and
embarrassed
and
was
at
a
loss
how
to
reply
he
need
not
have
troubled
himself
however
for
cornelia
continued
her
exposition
touching
the
superiority
of
american
everything
over
the
miserable
imitations
of
other
countries
with
hardly
as
much
as
a
comma
pause
for
breath
guest
sat
back
in
his
corner
looking
at
her
with
every
appearance
of
attention
but
in
reality
his
thoughts
were
engaged
in
following
a
bewildering
suggestion
they
think
we
are
a
honeymoon
couple
suppose
it
was
folly
of
course
but
for
one
moment
they
he
would
be
looking
at
his
wife
she
would
smile
across
at
him
and
call
him
fond
silly
little
names
he
would
kiss
her
she
had
beautiful
lips
to
kiss
and
hold
her
hand
it
was
a
soft
little
hand
to
hold
and
tease
her
about
her
shaded
hair
and
her
sharp
little
nose
and
her
ridiculous
pointed
shoes
they
would
get
out
at
the
terminus
but
instead
of
bidding
each
other
a
polite
would
drive
off
together
in
a
fly
discussing
joint
plans
for
the
evening
later
on
they
would
have
dinner
at
a
little
table
in
the
great
of
the
hotel
criticising
their
neighbours
and
laughing
at
their
peculiarities
in
the
theatre
they
would
whisper
together
and
when
the
curtain
went
up
on
the
heels
of
a
critical
moment
he
would
see
the
shining
once
more
on
her
it
was
a
lonely
business
going
off
to
a
man
club
where
nobody
wanted
you
or
cared
a
brass
farthing
whether
you
came
or
went
not
that
for
a
moment
he
wished
to
be
married
least
of
all
to
cornelia
briskett
there
were
a
dozen
things
about
her
which
jarred
on
his
nerves
and
offended
his
ideas
of
good
taste
he
objected
to
her
accent
her
unconventional
expressions
her
little
tricks
of
manner
while
on
almost
every
subject
her
point
of
view
appeared
to
be
diametrically
opposed
to
his
own
in
her
company
he
would
be
often
jarred
annoyed
and
discomfited
but
of
a
certainty
he
would
never
be
bored
rapidly
reviewing
his
life
for
the
last
few
years
it
appeared
to
guest
that
he
had
existed
in
a
chronic
state
of
boredom
if
we
were
a
honeymoon
couple
that
dreariness
at
least
would
come
to
an
end
he
looked
at
cornelia
ungloved
left
hand
resting
upon
the
dark
cushions
she
wore
a
ring
a
wide
flat
band
of
gold
with
one
fine
diamond
standing
far
out
in
a
claw
setting
american
ladies
affect
solitaire
rings
as
tokens
of
betrothal
did
this
mean
that
the
honeymooning
question
was
already
settled
if
it
were
so
the
fact
would
account
for
the
girl
absence
of
embarrassment
in
his
own
company
all
the
same
he
did
not
believe
it
for
there
was
in
her
manner
a
calm
virginal
composure
an
absence
of
sentimentality
which
seemed
to
denote
that
the
citadel
had
not
yet
been
stormed
cornelia
noted
his
gaze
without
in
the
least
guessing
its
meaning
it
was
the
other
wrist
that
was
sprained
the
right
one
she
said
holding
it
up
as
she
spoke
and
carefully
moving
it
to
and
fro
heaps
better
thanks
to
you
i
set
mury
to
rub
it
according
to
instructions
and
there
you
are
it
most
as
well
as
the
other
ready
to
shake
hands
now
oh
yes
mentally
as
well
as
physically
the
white
teeth
showed
in
a
smile
of
comprehension
i
guess
so
i
never
was
one
to
harbour
animosity
i
am
glad
of
that
you
bade
me
such
a
frigid
on
thursday
afternoon
that
i
was
afraid
you
had
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
me
my
stars
and
stripes
that
pretty
calm
what
about
i
beg
to
ask
cornelia
rolled
indignant
eyes
to
the
hanging
lamp
i
hev
to
think
i
from
your
own
lips
what
you
thought
about
i
could
rest
easy
in
my
bed
for
fear
you
went
home
and
did
away
with
mr
greville
for
making
you
drive
me
home
i
never
supposed
i
should
live
to
endoor
the
degradation
of
having
a
man
do
things
for
me
against
his
will
but
i
had
to
come
to
england
to
find
my
mistake
and
then
you
sit
there
and
accuse
me
of
disliking
you
well
guest
flushed
with
embarrassment
with
something
deeper
than
embarrassment
with
honest
shame
he
clasped
his
hands
between
his
knees
and
bent
forward
eagerly
you
are
quite
right
miss
briskett
there
is
no
excuse
for
me
i
behaved
like
a
cad
things
got
me
on
the
raw
somehow
i
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
which
were
true
that
no
excuse
i
know
i
should
have
controlled
myself
better
but
if
i
was
annoyed
at
starting
on
that
drive
i
was
far
more
so
when
it
came
to
an
end
you
had
your
revenge
and
you
do
deny
that
you
disliked
me
in
return
i
did
so
i
did
heaps
more
than
that
i
thought
you
just
the
hatefullest
person
i
ever
met
and
now
cornelia
laughed
easily
oh
well
we
had
a
pretty
good
time
together
have
we
we
can
let
bygones
be
bygones
you
english
vurry
vurry
english
but
i
guess
you
nice
what
do
you
mean
by
english
but
even
as
he
put
the
question
captain
guest
straightened
himself
and
reared
his
neck
within
his
stiff
upstanding
collar
with
that
air
of
ineffable
superiority
which
marks
the
englishman
in
his
intercourse
with
inferior
nations
cornelia
laughed
a
of
amusement
it
there
no
other
word
to
it
you
are
about
as
english
at
this
moment
as
you
been
in
the
whole
of
your
i
guess
we
must
be
getting
pretty
near
london
now
for
i
ken
see
nothing
but
smoke
yes
we
are
nearly
there
will
you
may
i
call
at
your
hotel
some
day
on
the
chance
of
finding
you
in
why
suttenly
i
love
to
have
you
you
could
take
me
round
if
the
moffatts
have
a
dinner
for
themselves
some
night
we
might
go
to
a
theatre
together
um
yes
guest
surveyed
her
with
doubtful
eyes
i
suppose
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
find
some
other
lady
to
play
chaperon
i
do
want
a
chaperon
why
should
i
it
no
fun
having
her
poking
round
and
listening
to
every
word
one
says
it
ever
so
much
nicer
alone
i
do
doubt
it
but
in
rome
one
must
do
as
the
romans
do
miss
briskett
in
england
a
man
does
not
take
a
girl
to
a
theatre
unchaperoned
it
not
the
thing
i
do
care
a
mite
it
the
custom
with
us
anyway
and
there
no
country
in
the
world
where
women
are
more
respected
what
the
harm
i
want
to
know
no
harm
at
all
that
not
the
question
it
simply
not
the
custom
do
you
mean
to
say
you
refuse
to
take
me
alone
even
if
i
ask
you
i
do
then
you
a
mean
old
thing
and
i
sha
go
at
all
guest
laughed
an
amused
little
laugh
in
which
there
was
an
unwonted
softness
somehow
he
quite
enjoyed
being
called
a
mean
old
thing
by
cornelia
briskett
there
was
an
intimacy
in
the
sound
which
more
than
nullified
the
disparagement
i
think
you
will
you
are
too
to
punish
me
for
what
is
not
my
fault
it
would
be
much
more
amusing
for
me
to
take
you
about
unattended
and
so
far
as
i
concerned
i
can
afford
to
ignore
conventions
a
man
can
do
as
he
likes
it
is
you
i
am
thinking
of
you
may
not
approve
of
our
ideas
but
that
does
not
alter
their
existence
or
the
fact
that
whip
you
are
here
you
must
be
judged
by
them
you
would
not
like
to
be
considered
careless
of
your
reputation
i
do
care
a
mite
what
the
old
fossils
think
do
then
and
i
will
take
no
part
in
putting
you
in
a
false
position
cornelia
pouted
but
in
her
heart
admired
his
firmness
as
any
woman
would
she
stared
at
the
forest
of
without
speaking
for
several
minutes
then
suddenly
turned
towards
him
speaking
in
what
was
evidently
supposed
to
be
a
lifelike
imitation
of
the
english
accent
as
spoken
by
the
lady
of
the
manor
how
varry
kind
i
shall
be
charmed
too
sweet
of
you
that
all
right
laughed
guest
happily
we
manage
to
enjoy
ourselves
never
fear
there
such
a
thing
as
taking
chaperons
and
letting
them
play
with
each
other
here
we
are
at
paddington
are
your
friends
coming
to
meet
you
they
are
i
guess
they
be
waiting
on
the
platform
she
tall
and
and
dresses
fit
to
kill
she
paused
with
a
sharp
little
intake
of
breath
for
the
train
as
it
snorted
into
the
station
had
passed
by
the
figure
of
a
woman
standing
conspicuously
alone
a
tall
woman
with
hair
of
a
violent
peroxide
gold
holding
up
an
elaborate
white
gown
to
display
a
petticoat
of
flounced
pink
silk
it
was
cornelia
first
introduction
to
mrs
moffatt
in
shore
clothes
and
to
an
eye
accustomed
to
norton
simplicity
the
vision
was
sufficiently
startling
also
it
was
hateful
to
think
such
things
but
that
hair
on
the
steamer
it
had
been
just
an
ordinary
brown
cornelia
would
have
died
rather
than
own
it
but
she
felt
a
qualm
on
the
platform
she
saw
other
ladies
standing
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
train
smart
even
ladies
not
a
few
but
none
in
the
least
resembling
mrs
silas
p
moffatt
a
swift
desire
arose
that
guest
might
depart
before
her
hostess
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
followed
by
a
resigned
recollection
that
that
would
be
of
no
avail
since
the
two
were
bound
to
meet
sooner
or
later
she
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
keeping
her
head
turned
in
an
opposite
direction
but
almost
immediately
a
crisp
rustling
of
skirts
a
strong
odour
of
violette
de
parme
and
a
loud
say
is
that
you
proclaimed
that
the
search
was
at
an
end
cornelia
forced
a
smile
to
her
lips
and
acknowledged
her
identity
in
suitable
terms
and
mrs
moffatt
gushed
over
her
in
a
yankee
accent
strong
enough
to
cut
with
a
knife
casting
the
while
arch
questioning
glances
in
guest
direction
cornelia
suffered
qualm
number
two
even
to
her
ears
the
tone
of
her
friend
voice
sounded
unduly
loud
and
nasal
and
looking
from
her
to
her
late
travelling
companion
it
appeared
that
to
be
english
need
not
be
invariably
a
disadvantage
of
course
mrs
moffatt
was
not
a
good
type
of
american
she
belonged
to
the
class
who
brought
that
honourable
title
into
disrepute
how
was
it
that
she
herself
had
hitherto
been
blind
to
peculiarities
which
now
aroused
an
instant
prejudice
do
you
want
to
introduce
me
to
your
friend
dear
i
never
came
across
such
a
girl
someone
flying
around
after
you
wherever
you
go
cried
mrs
moffatt
genially
and
cornelia
mumbled
the
necessary
words
with
an
unusual
display
of
embarrassment
she
dared
not
look
at
the
expression
of
guest
face
and
his
cool
easy
voice
gave
no
hint
of
his
real
feelings
she
turned
aside
to
give
instructions
to
a
porter
while
her
ears
strained
to
catch
every
word
which
passed
between
her
companions
mrs
moffatt
was
talking
about
her
gushing
over
her
in
fulsome
phrases
cornelia
this
cornelia
that
what
business
had
she
to
use
that
name
anyway
she
had
never
received
permission
to
do
so
it
was
impertinent
to
assume
such
an
air
of
familiarity
the
three
made
their
way
together
towards
the
luggage
van
where
cornelia
claimed
her
two
big
boxes
and
saw
them
hoisted
on
the
top
of
a
the
elation
of
ten
minutes
back
had
died
a
sudden
death
and
she
felt
depressed
and
lonesome
among
all
the
crowd
no
one
seemed
a
greater
stranger
than
this
woman
by
her
side
in
comparison
with
her
captain
guest
appeared
an
old
and
proven
friend
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
as
the
cabman
busily
strapped
the
last
box
to
the
roof
and
found
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
with
a
very
grave
scrutiny
she
did
not
know
how
pale
and
dejected
was
her
own
appearance
how
different
from
the
jaunty
of
an
hour
before
but
guest
had
been
keen
to
notice
the
quickly
succeeding
expressions
and
was
saying
to
himself
she
is
upset
something
is
different
from
what
she
expected
it
a
bad
lookout
for
her
with
that
terrible
woman
but
she
must
have
known
her
before
mrs
moffatt
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
giggled
meaningly
and
stepped
into
the
cab
they
were
alone
as
much
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
and
confusion
as
in
the
quiet
of
the
railway
carriage
well
said
guest
regretfully
i
suppose
i
must
say
come
round
soon
to
see
how
you
are
getting
along
and
miss
briskett
here
is
my
it
gives
the
address
of
my
club
if
you
should
need
me
for
anything
at
any
time
ring
me
up
you
will
promise
wo
you
i
could
be
with
you
in
a
few
minutes
cornelia
smiled
faintly
oh
thanks
i
do
know
about
mr
moffatt
will
be
round
to
look
after
us
but
norton
my
only
home
over
here
and
you
seem
like
a
bit
of
it
i
be
real
glad
to
see
you
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
held
it
for
a
moment
in
a
tight
protective
grasp
then
took
off
his
hat
to
mrs
moffatt
and
turned
away
twenty
yards
farther
on
the
cab
passed
him
and
he
caught
another
glimpse
of
the
two
faces
one
small
and
white
the
other
heavy
in
outline
and
suspiciously
as
to
cheeks
thank
heaven
i
came
up
said
captain
guest
to
himself
chapter
sixteen
cornelia
was
surprised
to
find
that
her
friends
were
not
already
housed
at
the
ritz
but
had
been
staying
at
a
private
hotel
in
a
dull
side
street
where
the
cab
called
on
the
way
from
the
station
to
take
up
a
pile
of
luggage
lying
ready
packed
in
the
hall
the
fashionable
hotels
are
all
crowded
out
in
the
season
mrs
moffatt
explained
we
had
our
names
down
for
ages
at
the
ritz
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
in
before
i
do
know
as
we
should
have
managed
even
now
if
it
had
been
for
you
dear
it
worked
wonders
when
we
said
you
would
be
one
of
the
party
you
do
mind
having
your
name
mentioned
do
you
you
just
got
to
play
up
to
these
managers
if
you
do
want
to
be
put
off
for
ever
or
poked
away
in
a
back
room
oh
i
do
mind
said
cornelia
easily
if
my
name
is
of
any
use
use
it
for
all
you
worth
i
should
have
supposed
anyone
would
know
it
over
here
they
do
in
norton
my
dear
the
hotel
is
crammed
full
of
americans
and
any
one
of
them
would
say
it
was
poor
business
to
refuse
the
daughter
of
edward
b
briskett
the
connection
might
be
worth
a
heap
if
you
went
home
and
allowed
you
were
satisfied
silas
do
count
for
anything
he
no
push
we
might
have
waited
for
ever
if
it
had
been
left
to
him
to
judge
by
the
hangdog
expression
of
the
said
silas
as
he
came
forward
to
greet
his
guest
at
the
door
of
the
ritz
the
success
attending
his
wife
manoeuvres
had
not
inspired
him
with
any
particular
joy
cornelia
thought
he
looked
more
henpecked
than
ever
but
he
received
her
warmly
and
hovered
round
to
assist
with
the
smaller
impedimenta
while
his
wife
hurried
forward
into
the
hotel
inside
all
was
brightness
and
gaiety
little
parties
of
visitors
grouped
here
and
there
about
the
large
light
hall
obsequious
clerks
bowing
before
one
hoping
that
the
rooms
reserved
might
give
satisfaction
begging
to
be
informed
if
any
comfort
were
lacking
summoning
waiters
to
show
the
way
to
the
lift
cornelia
was
annoyed
to
notice
that
most
of
these
attentions
were
directed
towards
herself
but
as
mrs
moffatt
did
not
appear
to
take
umbrage
it
seemed
wisest
to
make
no
protest
the
mistake
was
not
likely
to
occur
again
for
with
so
many
guests
in
the
house
individual
attention
could
not
extend
beyond
the
arrival
civilities
tea
was
served
in
the
empire
suite
which
had
been
reserved
for
the
party
and
cornelia
hated
herself
for
feeling
so
little
in
sympathy
with
a
host
and
hostess
whose
one
anxiety
seemed
to
be
to
provide
for
her
enjoyment
from
a
printed
list
of
amusements
she
was
bidden
to
make
her
choice
for
every
evening
in
the
week
for
the
afternoons
picnics
were
suggested
coaching
expeditions
to
outlying
scenes
of
interest
drives
in
the
park
for
the
mornings
well
naturally
there
was
just
one
thing
to
be
done
in
the
morning
and
that
was
shopping
i
hope
you
brought
up
heaps
of
money
my
dear
you
need
it
the
things
are
just
heavenly
this
season
mrs
moffatt
declared
but
cornelia
remained
unfired
i
a
circular
note
it
all
right
so
far
as
that
goes
but
i
want
any
more
clothes
for
ages
i
brought
over
a
whole
trousseau
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
half
will
go
back
unpacked
they
do
dress
down
at
norton
they
you
got
to
be
covered
right
up
to
the
chin
and
to
work
in
all
the
blue
serge
you
can
and
that
about
all
there
is
to
it
if
you
like
we
do
at
home
you
make
as
much
stir
as
the
i
like
to
mail
a
few
presents
if
i
saw
anything
really
new
and
snappy
but
i
sha
go
near
a
store
for
myself
i
shall
then
cried
mrs
moffatt
laughing
i
got
next
to
nothing
in
paris
the
shops
over
there
are
a
patch
on
london
in
my
opinion
and
the
language
puts
one
off
i
ca
get
the
hang
of
it
and
it
gets
on
my
nerves
fitting
on
clothes
and
not
being
able
to
find
fault
you
have
to
come
round
with
me
cornelia
i
been
waiting
till
you
came
to
decide
on
heaps
of
things
you
got
such
lovely
taste
silas
wants
to
give
me
some
furs
and
i
seen
an
emerald
necklace
that
i
bound
to
have
if
i
to
know
another
happy
moment
i
been
in
twice
to
see
it
and
i
guess
the
man
beginning
to
weaken
it
would
pay
him
to
let
me
have
it
at
a
reduction
rather
than
keep
it
lying
idle
you
shall
come
with
me
and
say
what
you
think
it
worth
but
mind
i
to
have
the
first
chance
you
must
try
to
snap
it
up
a
few
hundred
dollars
do
matter
to
you
one
way
or
the
other
but
got
to
worry
round
to
make
the
money
go
as
far
as
it
will
it
not
that
silas
wants
to
stint
me
he
not
that
sort
but
he
has
the
balance
behind
him
your
father
has
silas
smiled
in
sickly
acknowledgment
of
his
wife
consideration
fidgeted
in
his
seat
and
finally
took
himself
downstairs
to
see
about
securing
theatre
tickets
whereupon
his
wife
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
helped
herself
to
a
fresh
cup
of
tea
thank
goodness
i
ke
stand
men
in
the
daytime
they
do
take
any
interest
in
clothes
or
parcels
or
but
kinder
hang
round
looking
bored
and
superior
it
gets
on
my
nerves
that
was
a
real
man
you
had
with
you
dear
guest
did
you
say
captain
guest
english
is
he
acts
as
though
he
got
the
patent
and
everybody
else
was
imitation
i
rather
like
it
myself
i
think
anything
of
a
man
who
takes
a
back
seat
the
short
impatient
little
sigh
was
evidently
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
the
absent
silas
where
did
you
pick
him
up
dear
he
seems
very
devoted
anything
coming
on
between
you
cornelia
no
made
the
listener
start
in
her
seat
so
loud
was
it
so
stern
so
eloquent
of
displeasure
she
herself
was
astonished
at
the
white
heat
of
anger
which
possessed
her
as
she
listened
to
mrs
moffatt
questionings
picked
him
up
indeed
what
insolence
what
vulgarity
what
an
indignity
to
speak
of
him
in
such
words
her
indignation
seemed
almost
as
much
on
guest
account
as
her
own
a
vision
of
his
face
rose
before
her
she
seemed
to
see
the
curl
of
the
lip
the
droop
of
the
eyelid
with
which
he
would
have
greeted
such
an
expression
no
suttenly
not
he
is
the
merest
acquaintance
there
is
not
even
an
ordinary
friendship
between
us
i
may
very
probably
never
meet
him
again
is
that
so
queried
mrs
moffatt
calmly
as
the
captain
had
himself
announced
his
intention
of
calling
at
the
hotel
the
only
effect
of
cornelia
violence
was
to
deepen
the
impression
that
there
was
something
in
it
but
she
was
too
diplomatic
to
pursue
the
subject
instead
she
prattled
on
about
a
dozen
inconsequent
topics
and
finally
suggested
a
drive
in
the
park
before
dinner
it
will
freshen
you
up
after
your
journey
and
there
nothing
else
to
do
for
the
next
two
hours
just
ring
will
you
dear
and
make
arrangements
while
i
write
a
few
notes
in
my
room
a
victoria
or
a
motor
whichever
you
prefer
and
in
about
that
will
give
us
time
to
prink
she
rustled
out
of
the
room
and
cornelia
rang
and
gave
the
order
only
too
thankful
to
avoid
a
prolonged
indoors
once
again
she
wondered
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
she
had
become
on
intimate
terms
with
this
woman
who
now
jarred
upon
her
at
every
turn
on
board
the
steamer
her
own
friends
had
scarcely
left
their
during
the
voyage
and
mrs
moffatt
in
a
neat
tweed
costume
and
an
enveloping
blue
veil
had
played
the
part
of
ministering
angel
with
much
devotion
during
three
dreary
days
when
she
herself
had
lain
on
a
chair
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
deck
had
read
aloud
repeated
amusing
little
anecdotes
about
the
passengers
taken
her
for
constitutionals
up
and
down
and
even
helped
her
to
bed
at
night
when
liverpool
was
reached
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
known
one
another
for
years
they
had
kissed
at
parting
and
mutually
agreed
to
meet
and
have
a
good
time
shucks
cried
cornelia
mentally
it
that
old
norton
i
gotten
so
used
to
dowds
that
the
sight
of
a
paris
gown
scares
me
all
into
fits
i
looked
forward
to
coming
to
london
all
my
life
and
now
here
i
going
to
enjoy
myself
all
i
know
now
then
for
the
park
i
guess
that
grey
crepe
and
the
hat
with
the
white
feathers
will
be
about
the
best
i
can
do
for
the
honour
of
the
flag
you
got
to
strike
a
balance
my
dear
and
plump
for
neutral
colours
as
long
as
you
run
in
harness
with
mrs
silas
p
moffatt
that
first
drive
in
hyde
park
was
a
pleasant
experience
though
the
trees
looked
grey
and
dusty
after
the
fresh
green
of
the
country
cornelia
like
most
of
her
sisters
had
as
a
first
object
to
see
the
people
not
the
park
itself
and
certainly
they
were
worth
the
seeing
there
is
no
place
in
the
world
where
finer
specimens
of
humanity
can
be
seen
than
in
hyde
park
on
the
afternoon
of
a
bright
june
day
cornelia
admired
the
tall
men
the
dainty
looking
women
with
their
air
of
indolent
grace
they
did
not
look
as
if
they
were
enjoying
themselves
particularly
but
she
enjoyed
looking
at
them
and
honestly
acknowledged
the
presence
of
a
certain
quality
unowned
by
herself
they
got
a
look
as
if
they
see
anything
nearer
than
a
hundred
miles
and
were
scared
to
laugh
in
case
they
might
break
i
guess
it
what
they
call
captain
guest
got
it
too
we
not
much
use
for
that
kind
of
thing
at
home
but
it
counts
if
you
been
used
to
it
all
your
life
it
would
be
a
jar
to
step
down
mrs
moffatt
knew
a
great
many
people
by
sight
and
pointed
them
out
as
they
drove
by
lady
this
the
countess
of
that
mrs
blank
who
wrote
society
novels
and
was
noted
for
her
taste
in
dress
the
beautiful
miss
not
that
i
can
see
much
beauty
in
her
myself
she
not
a
patch
on
you
when
you
in
form
cornelia
felt
a
girl
natural
pleasure
in
the
compliment
in
the
truth
of
which
she
complacently
agreed
she
did
not
envy
miss
dash
her
looks
but
she
did
emphatically
envy
her
her
friends
particularly
her
male
friends
who
clustered
around
her
carriage
eager
for
a
word
one
felt
decidedly
out
of
it
driving
through
a
crowd
of
strangers
not
one
of
whom
turned
a
welcoming
smile
in
your
direction
nor
cared
whether
you
came
or
went
at
home
cornelia
was
accustomed
to
be
in
the
midst
of
all
that
was
going
on
a
central
figure
round
which
all
the
rest
revolved
she
did
not
at
all
appreciate
being
relegated
to
the
position
of
regarding
the
fray
from
the
vantage
of
a
hired
vehicle
cornelia
craned
her
head
to
right
and
to
left
scanning
the
passing
crowd
for
a
familiar
face
it
seemed
impossible
that
among
hundreds
of
people
there
should
not
be
someone
whom
she
recognised
and
her
faith
was
justified
for
just
at
the
bend
near
the
marble
arch
she
had
a
passing
glimpse
of
guest
tall
figure
standing
talking
to
two
ladies
one
the
other
young
and
graceful
and
smiling
they
were
quietly
even
simply
attired
but
their
whole
air
and
carriage
breathed
that
indefinable
something
which
she
had
just
struggled
to
define
something
diametrically
different
from
the
ostentatious
display
of
the
woman
by
her
side
theoretically
cornelia
was
thankful
to
escape
observation
in
reality
she
felt
an
absurd
pang
of
loneliness
and
disappointment
as
the
carriage
bore
her
out
of
sight
the
evening
was
spent
at
a
theatre
and
by
eleven
next
morning
both
ladies
had
started
forth
on
one
of
the
shopping
expeditions
which
seemed
to
constitute
mrs
moffatt
chief
pleasure
in
life
they
drove
first
of
all
to
the
jeweller
where
cornelia
was
shown
the
emerald
necklace
a
wonderful
collection
of
stones
in
an
antique
setting
with
which
she
herself
promptly
fell
in
love
the
price
was
excessive
even
for
her
own
deep
purse
and
she
concluded
that
mr
moffatt
means
must
be
even
larger
than
she
had
imagined
since
his
wife
seriously
contemplated
such
a
purchase
there
was
a
good
deal
of
bargaining
between
mrs
moffatt
and
the
very
looking
personage
behind
the
counter
but
fortified
by
the
advent
of
another
possible
purchaser
the
latter
steadily
refused
to
reduce
his
price
and
once
again
mrs
moffatt
retired
discomfited
from
the
struggle
i
know
just
how
it
will
be
she
cried
i
have
to
give
it
up
and
then
you
step
in
and
carry
it
off
before
my
eyes
but
you
got
to
wait
a
bit
till
i
see
what
i
can
do
with
silas
i
not
going
to
give
up
yet
awhile
cornelia
laughed
easily
oh
i
play
fair
if
you
give
up
the
idea
i
daresay
poppar
let
me
have
it
he
says
emeralds
suit
me
better
than
any
other
stones
but
i
sha
break
my
heart
one
way
or
the
other
then
addressing
the
shopman
have
you
got
anything
really
new
and
tasty
for
little
presents
i
might
as
well
look
round
while
i
here
then
followed
a
delightful
hour
from
the
shopkeeper
point
of
view
at
least
when
cornelia
examined
the
contents
of
tray
after
tray
and
selected
little
presents
to
the
value
of
a
cool
hundred
pounds
an
old
pearl
and
enamel
solitaire
stud
for
her
father
a
composed
of
a
big
turquoise
and
a
selection
of
dainty
jewelled
brooches
and
bangles
for
special
girl
friends
i
give
you
the
addresses
and
you
better
mail
them
from
here
i
do
know
how
you
fix
up
things
to
travel
safely
from
this
side
but
you
can
do
all
that
necessary
i
give
you
a
cheque
and
you
send
them
out
till
you
see
that
it
all
right
i
a
stranger
to
you
and
ca
expect
you
to
trust
me
right
away
but
you
find
the
there
well
i
should
think
your
name
good
enough
no
one
need
fear
trusting
your
father
daughter
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
mrs
moffatt
protested
while
the
shopman
waxed
eloquent
in
protestation
cornelia
continued
to
write
addresses
on
the
various
boxes
without
troubling
to
answer
for
the
assiduous
manner
in
which
her
friend
advertised
her
parentage
was
already
beginning
to
jar
first
to
the
hotel
officials
then
to
casual
acquaintances
during
the
evening
and
now
to
this
tradesman
it
was
a
disagreeable
change
from
norton
where
the
subject
of
money
was
never
mentioned
and
no
one
seemed
to
care
whether
you
were
rich
or
poor
the
whole
morning
was
devoted
to
shopping
in
the
afternoon
the
two
ladies
went
out
driving
and
returned
to
the
hotel
to
find
captain
guest
card
on
the
table
he
has
lost
no
time
anyhow
said
mrs
moffatt
meaningly
he
has
done
the
polite
thing
now
he
need
not
trouble
any
more
cornelia
replied
on
the
whole
she
was
not
sorry
to
have
missed
the
call
conversation
with
mrs
moffatt
as
audience
would
have
been
somewhat
of
a
strain
chapter
seventeen
the
moffatts
appeared
to
have
few
private
friends
in
london
and
to
show
no
anxiety
to
add
to
their
number
though
they
displayed
an
insatiable
curiosity
about
everything
which
concerned
their
guest
they
volunteered
very
little
information
in
return
and
after
three
days
spent
entirely
in
their
society
cornelia
knew
little
more
about
them
than
on
the
first
day
of
their
meeting
on
shipboard
a
mushroom
city
of
the
west
figured
as
home
in
occasional
references
but
the
wife
frankly
declared
a
hatred
of
domesticity
while
the
husband
regretted
that
constant
travel
was
a
necessity
in
his
business
evidently
the
present
period
was
one
of
for
mr
moffatt
seemed
to
do
nothing
but
hang
about
the
hotel
playing
odd
games
of
bridge
or
billiards
with
stray
loafers
like
himself
and
being
correspondingly
elated
or
depressed
as
he
won
or
lost
on
the
whole
cornelia
preferred
him
when
he
was
depressed
exuberance
of
spirits
is
apt
to
wax
offensive
when
divorced
from
good
taste
at
times
she
frankly
disliked
both
husband
and
wife
and
meditated
an
immediate
return
to
norton
but
as
a
rule
she
was
absorbed
in
the
interest
and
charm
of
the
grey
old
city
which
was
so
unlike
anything
she
had
yet
visited
it
was
like
turning
back
a
page
of
history
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
those
historical
landmarks
of
which
she
had
read
since
childhood
to
drive
about
looking
at
the
names
of
the
streets
the
monuments
at
the
corners
the
great
inky
buildings
visitors
from
sunnier
lands
often
take
away
from
our
capital
an
impression
of
gloom
and
ugliness
but
cornelia
artistic
sense
realised
a
picturesque
element
which
rose
superior
to
smoke
and
grime
she
loved
the
narrow
irregular
streets
the
turneresque
haze
which
hung
over
the
sky
even
in
this
fine
summer
weather
the
city
was
a
solemn
land
of
work
but
the
west
end
was
a
fairy
realm
of
luxury
and
pleasure
flowers
everywhere
stacked
up
in
great
piles
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
hanging
from
massed
together
in
the
beds
of
the
parks
the
carriages
blocked
one
another
in
the
narrow
roads
the
balconies
were
draped
with
awnings
clad
flunkeys
stood
upon
the
doorsteps
ushering
in
long
streams
of
visitors
in
the
city
men
worked
for
money
in
the
west
end
they
threw
it
away
carelessly
heedlessly
as
if
it
had
been
dross
the
great
hotels
sheltered
hives
of
strangers
who
admired
and
criticised
envied
and
scoffed
and
flitted
industriously
about
on
the
edge
of
the
feast
on
the
edge
but
never
actually
passing
over
the
border
on
the
fourth
morning
of
her
stay
in
town
a
note
addressed
in
a
strange
handwriting
was
brought
to
cornelia
with
her
morning
tea
she
guessed
at
its
authorship
before
opening
the
envelope
and
reading
the
name
rupert
guest
at
the
end
of
the
letter
rupert
a
good
name
an
appropriate
name
strong
and
manly
with
an
echo
of
dignity
in
the
sound
one
could
not
associate
this
man
with
abbreviations
or
nicknames
at
work
and
at
play
at
home
and
abroad
he
would
remain
plain
unabbreviated
rupert
one
doubted
if
even
his
own
mother
ventured
on
a
familiarity
cornelia
read
the
few
lines
with
lively
curiosity
dear
miss
briskett
i
was
disappointed
to
miss
seeing
you
when
i
called
at
your
hotel
on
saturday
my
aunt
lady
seymour
is
giving
a
reception
afternoon
and
would
be
delighted
to
see
you
and
your
friends
if
you
have
nothing
better
on
hand
there
ought
to
be
some
pretty
good
music
i
will
call
at
three
on
the
chance
that
you
may
care
to
yours
faithfully
rupert
guest
enclosed
was
a
formal
card
of
invitation
dated
from
grosvenor
gate
miss
briskett
and
party
written
on
the
corner
cornelia
sat
banked
up
against
her
pillows
her
ruddy
locks
framing
her
little
face
in
a
glory
of
rippling
curls
and
waves
her
lips
pursed
in
slow
reflection
i
guess
miss
briskett
and
party
would
rather
not
i
do
see
the
fun
of
squeezing
in
among
a
lot
of
grandees
who
do
want
anything
of
us
but
just
to
quiz
and
stare
and
make
remarks
if
he
asked
me
alone
i
have
risked
it
just
to
see
how
they
manage
their
shows
over
here
but
he
too
proper
to
take
me
without
a
chaperon
and
well
anyway
the
moffatts
are
good
to
me
and
i
have
no
hand
in
having
them
snubbed
miss
briskett
will
politely
refuse
and
the
party
wo
have
a
chance
of
accepting
for
they
wo
be
told
anything
about
it
i
hate
a
fuss
cornelia
went
downstairs
deciding
to
write
a
letter
before
going
out
and
post
it
to
the
club
but
during
breakfast
mrs
moffatt
announced
with
profuse
apologies
that
she
and
her
husband
were
obliged
to
devote
the
afternoon
to
visiting
a
friend
living
at
some
distance
from
town
and
must
therefore
leave
her
to
her
own
resources
perhaps
she
would
like
to
do
a
little
shopping
on
her
own
account
take
a
drive
or
visit
a
gallery
cornelia
with
a
sudden
rising
of
spirits
guessed
she
could
find
a
dozen
things
to
do
and
bade
her
friends
feel
no
anxiety
on
her
score
she
wrote
no
letters
that
morning
but
sallied
forth
on
the
inevitable
shopping
excursion
with
a
particularly
gay
and
jaunty
air
and
an
inclination
to
bubble
into
laughter
on
the
slightest
provocation
at
which
mrs
moffatt
exclaimed
in
envy
my
what
spirits
you
do
enjoy
i
wish
i
could
laugh
like
that
some
people
have
all
the
luck
she
sighed
as
she
spoke
and
cornelia
glancing
at
her
caught
a
haggard
look
beneath
the
white
veil
it
occurred
to
her
for
the
first
time
that
her
hostess
was
no
longer
young
she
wondered
how
she
would
look
at
night
denuded
of
powder
and
rouge
and
luxuriant
golden
locks
an
elderly
woman
thin
and
worn
with
the
crow
feet
deepening
round
her
eyes
a
woman
whose
life
was
spent
in
the
pursuit
of
personal
gain
and
who
reaped
in
return
the
inevitable
harvest
of
weariness
and
satiety
cornelia
was
too
happy
to
judge
her
harshly
she
was
sorry
for
her
and
made
a
point
of
being
unusually
amiable
during
the
long
hours
of
trailing
about
from
shop
to
shop
which
were
beginning
to
be
a
severe
tax
on
her
patience
mrs
moffatt
never
seemed
to
make
a
purchase
outright
but
preferred
to
pay
half
a
dozen
visits
to
a
shop
trying
on
garment
or
ornament
as
the
case
might
be
haggling
over
the
price
and
throwing
small
sops
to
the
vendor
in
the
shape
of
the
purchase
of
insignificant
trifles
cornelia
herself
was
tempted
to
buy
a
number
of
articles
which
she
neither
needed
nor
knew
exactly
how
to
use
partly
from
want
of
something
to
do
while
her
companion
was
occupied
and
partly
from
a
sense
of
shame
at
giving
so
much
trouble
for
nothing
every
day
also
boxes
of
fineries
were
sent
on
approval
to
the
hotel
so
that
one
seemed
to
live
in
a
constant
atmosphere
of
milliner
shop
cornelia
wondered
to
what
purpose
was
this
everlasting
dressing
up
the
dejected
silas
could
hardly
count
as
an
audience
since
he
was
the
most
indifferent
of
husbands
and
it
seemed
a
poor
reward
for
so
much
trouble
to
receive
the
passing
glances
of
strangers
i
hope
when
i
settle
down
i
have
some
real
interest
in
life
take
care
that
i
have
too
i
go
crazed
if
there
was
nothing
more
to
it
than
hanging
round
stores
all
the
time
said
cornelia
to
herself
as
she
bade
farewell
to
her
friends
after
lunch
and
settled
herself
with
a
book
in
the
corner
of
the
lounge
to
await
guest
arrival
she
was
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
him
again
mischievously
amused
at
the
anticipation
of
his
embarrassment
when
he
found
that
her
chaperons
had
fled
it
would
be
a
delightful
change
to
chat
with
him
for
half
an
hour
and
when
he
departed
to
listen
to
the
pretty
good
music
she
herself
would
get
into
a
hansom
and
drive
to
saint
paul
to
listen
to
the
wonderful
boys
voices
chanting
the
evening
service
cathedrals
were
not
included
in
the
london
known
to
mrs
silas
p
moffatt
but
cornelia
was
determined
not
to
leave
the
metropolis
without
visiting
the
great
temple
of
the
east
after
four
days
of
pure
undiluted
moffatt
she
felt
mentally
and
spiritually
starved
it
would
be
good
to
leave
the
world
and
sit
apart
awhile
beneath
the
great
dome
at
five
minutes
past
three
by
the
clock
guest
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
hotel
made
an
inquiry
of
the
porter
and
was
directed
to
cornelia
sheltered
seat
she
saw
him
cast
a
glance
over
her
neat
walking
costume
as
he
approached
and
naughtily
determined
to
prolong
his
uncertainty
on
her
own
side
she
honestly
admired
his
appearance
compared
him
to
his
advantage
with
the
other
men
in
the
hall
and
was
proud
to
welcome
him
as
her
friend
her
little
white
face
was
sparkling
with
animation
as
she
held
out
her
hand
to
greet
him
how
do
captain
guest
it
real
good
of
you
to
come
again
so
soon
i
was
sorry
to
miss
you
saturday
afternoon
so
was
i
guest
seated
himself
and
deposited
his
hat
carefully
by
his
side
i
waited
half
an
hour
and
then
gave
it
up
and
went
to
loaf
in
the
park
it
the
only
thing
to
do
before
dinner
i
saw
you
there
standing
on
the
sidewalk
talking
to
two
ladies
an
old
one
and
a
young
one
as
pretty
as
a
moss
rose
he
suggested
quickly
and
they
laughed
together
over
the
remembrance
were
you
driving
i
wish
i
had
seen
you
is
er
mrs
moffatt
quite
well
puffectly
thank
you
said
cornelia
calmly
she
noted
the
quick
glance
around
and
wondered
if
he
felt
it
compromising
to
sit
with
her
alone
even
in
the
publicity
of
a
hotel
lounge
we
drive
most
afternoons
and
go
to
the
theatre
every
evening
i
having
a
giddy
time
just
about
as
different
from
norton
as
it
possible
to
imagine
have
you
heard
anything
from
the
manor
that
wretched
girl
has
never
sent
me
as
much
as
a
postal
and
i
dying
to
hear
what
going
on
no
i
heard
nothing
i
never
for
a
moment
expected
that
i
should
greville
is
too
much
engaged
guest
knitted
his
brows
bitched
his
trousers
at
the
knee
and
cleared
his
throat
uncertainly
cornelia
divined
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
refer
to
his
aunt
invitation
and
feeling
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
severity
of
her
costume
at
last
the
question
came
out
suddenly
er
you
got
my
note
i
did
i
thank
you
for
it
it
was
real
kind
of
good
to
take
the
trouble
i
suppose
you
had
to
go
and
ask
for
those
invitations
i
asked
of
course
but
my
aunt
was
delighted
to
give
them
it
will
be
quite
worth
going
to
i
think
good
music
and
something
of
a
function
you
would
enjoy
seeing
the
people
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
say
that
you
ca
come
what
makes
you
think
that
i
wonder
do
i
look
smart
enough
sorry
you
do
approve
of
my
costume
she
sat
up
straight
in
her
seat
a
smart
little
hat
perched
on
the
top
of
shaded
locks
a
neat
little
stock
beneath
the
collar
of
her
coat
minute
little
shoes
with
ridiculous
points
appearing
beneath
the
hem
of
her
skirt
guest
looked
her
over
deliberately
his
dark
face
softening
into
a
very
charming
smile
i
do
very
much
indeed
maybe
it
a
trifle
homely
but
it
best
to
strike
a
balance
mrs
moffatt
apt
to
be
a
bit
gaudy
on
these
occasions
it
is
very
good
of
her
to
take
so
much
trouble
is
er
is
she
nearly
ready
do
you
know
cornelia
had
been
narrowly
on
the
watch
for
the
flicker
of
dismay
on
guest
face
it
came
surely
enough
but
was
suppressed
by
such
a
gallant
effort
that
to
use
her
own
vernacular
she
weakened
at
the
sight
the
impish
light
died
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
said
frankly
i
guess
i
been
jollying
all
the
time
mrs
moffatt
gone
with
her
husband
to
visit
a
friend
who
lives
quite
a
good
way
out
and
she
be
back
before
seven
i
did
tell
her
of
your
invitation
as
her
plans
were
made
so
it
was
worth
while
i
in
london
for
the
afternoon
sounds
kinder
pathetic
do
it
but
i
enjoying
it
very
well
then
er
am
i
to
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
alone
cornelia
threw
him
a
glance
of
tragic
reproach
captain
guest
i
how
dare
you
take
advantage
of
my
unprotected
position
to
make
such
a
suggestion
in
england
young
girls
young
girls
do
not
go
about
with
young
gentlemen
unchaperoned
i
shocked
at
you
i
should
have
believed
you
would
have
been
more
considerate
we
could
start
early
i
could
introduce
you
to
my
aunt
she
would
find
some
ladies
with
whom
you
could
sit
during
the
concert
cornelia
made
a
grimace
the
reverse
of
appreciative
no
thank
you
i
guess
not
i
not
of
sitting
with
ladies
at
any
time
but
strange
ones
are
the
limit
you
tell
your
aunt
that
it
real
kind
of
her
and
i
vury
much
regret
that
i
do
want
to
go
i
just
how
i
going
to
spend
the
afternoon
first
going
to
give
you
some
coffee
the
waiter
bringing
it
along
then
when
you
go
off
to
your
crush
i
shall
get
into
a
hansom
and
drive
away
into
the
city
to
saint
paul
the
service
is
at
four
i
sit
right
by
myself
and
listen
till
that
over
then
i
go
round
and
see
the
tombs
quite
a
number
of
big
people
are
buried
there
i
told
saint
paul
guest
tone
was
eloquent
of
amazement
but
why
saint
paul
of
all
places
on
earth
why
not
hit
on
something
livelier
while
you
are
about
it
there
a
splendid
exhibition
of
paintings
in
bond
street
and
the
academy
of
course
and
the
wallace
collection
half
a
dozen
shows
which
are
worth
seeing
why
go
into
the
city
on
a
day
like
this
because
i
want
to
i
had
four
days
cram
full
of
she
hesitated
seeking
for
a
word
that
would
not
incriminate
her
hosts
of
and
i
want
something
else
for
a
change
from
all
i
hear
saint
paul
is
a
kinder
big
and
soothing
and
empty
you
can
sit
and
think
without
being
jostled
up
against
someone
else
all
the
time
i
do
suppose
there
a
more
sociable
creature
on
earth
than
i
am
myself
but
every
now
and
then
i
just
to
get
away
and
have
things
out
by
myself
guest
sipped
his
coffee
in
thoughtful
silence
glancing
at
cornelia
from
time
to
time
with
eyes
full
of
a
new
diffidence
an
impulse
gripped
him
an
impulse
so
extraordinary
that
he
hesitated
to
put
it
into
words
he
wanted
to
go
to
saint
paul
too
to
drive
beside
cornelia
through
the
streets
to
see
her
face
as
she
sat
in
the
dim
old
cathedral
that
softened
tremulous
face
of
which
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
once
before
the
memory
of
which
lived
with
him
still
when
the
service
was
over
he
wanted
to
be
her
guide
to
climb
with
her
the
tortuous
staircase
and
look
down
on
the
figures
in
the
streets
below
to
descend
with
her
to
the
subterranean
vaults
he
rupert
guest
wished
to
visit
saint
paul
on
a
grilling
june
afternoon
in
preference
to
attending
a
fashionable
rendezvous
what
madness
was
this
which
possessed
him
it
was
rank
folly
he
would
be
ashamed
to
put
the
request
into
words
pshaw
it
was
only
the
impulse
of
a
moment
he
would
never
think
of
it
again
then
he
looked
at
cornelia
once
more
and
heard
himself
say
in
deliberate
tones
may
i
come
with
you
i
should
not
interrupt
if
you
prefer
i
could
sit
in
another
place
during
the
service
but
i
like
to
come
afterwards
we
could
go
round
together
it
would
be
good
of
you
to
give
me
the
chance
but
the
reception
oh
hang
the
reception
i
not
sure
that
i
should
go
in
any
ease
do
let
me
come
miss
briskett
i
want
to
badly
cornelia
hesitated
staring
at
him
with
puzzled
eyes
you
seemed
to
think
saint
paul
a
pretty
queer
choice
when
i
mentioned
it
a
few
minutes
back
i
did
more
shame
to
me
i
suppose
but
then
you
explained
your
i
do
pretend
that
i
should
care
to
go
by
myself
but
if
you
take
me
as
your
companion
it
might
be
good
for
me
too
would
it
disturb
you
to
have
me
there
said
cornelia
slowly
i
as
lief
you
were
there
as
not
i
feel
differently
since
i
heard
that
story
you
must
need
heartening
up
sometimes
let
go
right
along
then
and
see
if
we
ke
lay
in
a
store
of
good
thoughts
that
will
help
us
along
for
quite
a
while
will
you
order
a
cab
guest
walked
in
silence
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
by
his
own
request
he
was
going
to
attend
a
church
afternoon
service
with
cornelia
briskett
the
thing
seemed
too
extraordinary
to
be
believed
he
took
his
seat
in
the
hansom
in
a
kind
of
stunned
surprise
truly
every
man
was
a
stranger
to
himself
and
there
was
no
foretelling
what
an
hour
might
bring
forth
cornelia
turned
to
survey
herself
in
the
slip
of
mirror
and
carefully
adjusted
the
set
of
her
hat
say
she
cried
laughingly
we
forgotten
that
chaperon
suppose
you
think
one
not
needed
in
a
cathedral
she
paused
dimpling
mischievously
well
that
just
as
you
made
i
guess
if
i
were
set
on
it
i
could
flirt
in
a
chapter
eighteen
captain
guest
could
not
flatter
himself
that
cornelia
was
in
anyway
set
on
flirting
with
himself
since
nothing
could
have
been
further
removed
from
that
attitude
than
her
behaviour
during
the
afternoon
she
displayed
a
keen
interest
in
her
first
view
of
the
strand
and
fleet
street
and
though
her
criticisms
of
those
ancient
thoroughfares
were
the
reverse
of
complimentary
she
was
evidently
impressed
by
the
vast
solemnity
of
the
cathedral
itself
the
usual
congregation
of
stragglers
were
dotted
about
on
the
chairs
in
the
nave
derelicts
from
god
knows
where
who
drift
in
through
the
open
doorways
seeking
refuge
from
heat
in
summer
and
cold
in
winter
and
listen
with
apathetic
indifference
to
the
passing
services
guest
seated
himself
by
cornelia
side
at
the
end
of
an
unoccupied
row
but
for
all
the
notice
she
paid
him
he
might
as
well
have
been
at
his
aunt
reception
miles
away
only
once
as
the
boys
voices
soared
upwards
in
a
strain
of
almost
unearthly
sweetness
did
she
turn
her
face
towards
him
in
involuntary
appeal
for
sympathy
and
at
that
moment
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
as
to
her
looks
she
was
beautiful
so
beautiful
that
guest
was
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
the
white
kindled
face
the
service
was
an
unmitigated
success
an
hour
to
cherish
in
memory
but
in
the
expedition
which
followed
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
cornelia
even
the
most
phlegmatic
of
englishmen
must
be
roused
to
a
feeling
of
pride
by
such
a
review
of
the
deeds
of
his
countrymen
as
is
set
forth
in
a
national
cathedral
it
may
be
even
conceded
that
his
attitude
may
be
a
trifle
irritating
to
strangers
from
distant
lands
be
that
as
it
may
guest
and
cornelia
seemed
fated
to
view
everything
from
different
points
of
view
where
he
waxed
enthusiastic
she
displayed
cool
commonsense
when
he
stood
dumb
she
criticised
the
design
of
the
sculpture
and
speculated
as
to
the
cost
she
guessed
it
was
playing
it
pretty
low
down
on
wellington
to
stow
him
away
in
a
cellar
and
made
scathing
remarks
by
gordon
memorial
you
muffed
it
badly
that
time
guess
if
he
belonged
to
he
have
been
hopping
round
still
guest
was
thankful
to
mount
the
narrow
staircase
leading
to
the
golden
gallery
for
cornelia
was
so
essentially
a
creature
of
that
he
felt
more
in
sympathy
with
her
in
the
air
and
the
sunshine
with
the
echo
of
the
great
city
rising
to
their
ears
they
stood
side
by
side
while
the
breeze
blew
tendrils
of
hair
round
the
girl
face
the
gentle
expression
of
half
an
hour
ago
had
departed
and
she
looked
a
creature
of
steel
and
flame
a
vital
indomitable
being
tingling
with
energy
and
joy
at
sight
of
the
forest
of
chimney
pots
stretching
away
into
the
horizon
her
eyes
shone
with
an
enthusiasm
which
the
wonders
of
the
cathedral
had
failed
to
inspire
to
guest
the
outlook
was
dreariness
personified
the
vastness
which
so
impressed
his
companion
conveyed
to
him
only
a
realisation
of
work
and
struggle
of
a
in
which
human
creatures
struggled
for
existence
he
stood
in
silence
while
cornelia
exhausted
her
supply
of
adjectives
brooding
on
the
difference
in
the
standpoints
from
which
each
regarded
life
until
presently
she
interrupted
with
a
personal
question
you
have
never
told
me
where
you
live
captain
guest
london
is
not
your
real
home
is
it
thank
goodness
no
i
could
never
live
in
a
city
my
home
is
in
the
country
staffordshire
it
was
a
valuable
property
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
but
the
factories
have
crept
nearer
and
nearer
and
of
course
that
depreciates
values
it
is
let
at
present
i
hope
to
save
enough
money
to
go
back
in
time
to
end
my
days
there
it
a
fine
old
place
but
its
value
is
bound
to
go
on
dropping
could
you
pull
it
down
and
build
small
property
on
the
site
if
there
are
factories
about
it
might
pay
vury
well
guest
look
of
stupefaction
incredulity
of
horror
could
scarcely
have
been
greater
if
cornelia
had
suggested
a
leap
down
to
the
street
beneath
good
heavens
what
an
idea
you
ca
realise
what
you
are
talking
about
miss
briskett
that
house
has
been
in
the
possession
of
my
family
since
the
time
of
the
tudors
cornelia
elevated
indifferent
eyebrows
i
do
know
as
that
any
reason
why
you
should
drop
money
on
it
now
i
would
take
any
stock
of
toodors
beside
my
own
convenience
it
better
to
own
a
house
you
ken
live
in
than
the
garden
of
eden
and
be
obliged
to
rent
it
out
there
is
such
a
thing
as
sentiment
miss
briskett
though
you
seem
to
realise
it
do
you
make
any
mistake
about
that
i
realise
it
right
enough
death
on
sentiment
in
its
right
place
but
it
takes
a
back
seat
when
daily
bread
comes
into
the
question
and
if
i
told
you
that
i
rather
starve
than
desecrate
the
home
of
my
ancestors
that
i
sooner
end
my
days
in
a
london
garret
than
level
a
single
wall
for
my
own
benefit
what
then
would
you
put
me
down
as
a
madman
for
my
pains
guest
spoke
with
unwonted
passion
staring
down
into
the
girl
face
with
challenging
eyes
but
cornelia
preserved
her
attitude
of
complacent
albeit
commiserating
superiority
my
poppar
say
it
was
sheer
wickedness
to
see
a
chance
of
making
money
and
letting
it
slide
but
i
do
go
so
far
as
that
everyone
has
a
right
to
be
miserable
in
his
own
way
but
i
prefer
to
be
comfortable
her
ripple
of
laughter
struck
a
chill
to
guest
heart
he
looked
at
her
moodily
beneath
knitted
brows
how
is
it
that
we
always
feel
differently
we
seem
never
to
agree
what
is
the
explanation
i
wonder
we
different
returned
cornelia
simply
the
difference
is
deep
down
beneath
all
we
say
or
do
we
differently
from
the
start
you
felt
it
the
first
moment
we
met
and
i
did
the
same
we
kinder
hated
each
other
and
wanted
to
scratch
that
was
instinct
you
do
get
behind
instinct
in
a
hurry
later
on
other
things
come
in
and
muddle
one
up
but
just
in
the
first
moment
one
sees
clearly
you
thought
elma
ramsden
the
sweetest
thing
and
were
all
fired
up
to
help
her
but
when
you
looked
at
me
you
were
bursting
with
pride
and
prejudice
why
was
that
i
want
to
know
you
have
answered
yourself
prejudice
a
blind
ignorant
prejudice
of
which
i
am
ashamed
and
pride
wounded
pride
because
you
attempted
to
lay
down
the
law
do
judge
me
by
that
unfortunate
beginning
miss
briskett
i
have
repented
sufficiently
to
deserve
forgiveness
cornelia
rested
her
chin
on
her
clasped
hands
and
stared
thoughtfully
over
the
forest
of
you
are
sorry
because
i
a
girl
and
we
had
some
pretty
good
times
together
but
that
do
alter
the
position
of
the
case
i
guess
we
are
each
pretty
good
types
of
our
different
nationalities
we
ke
blame
ourselves
for
that
if
the
truth
told
i
expect
we
are
proud
of
it
but
it
makes
it
impossible
to
feel
the
same
way
we
bound
to
jolt
up
against
each
other
every
time
we
dip
below
the
surface
you
find
it
impossible
then
to
think
of
me
as
a
friend
to
his
own
amazement
there
was
a
touch
of
genuine
anxiety
in
voice
it
seemed
to
matter
a
great
deal
whether
this
girl
of
the
ruddy
locks
and
curling
lips
accepted
his
friendship
or
deliberately
put
it
aside
to
matter
none
the
less
that
she
had
jarred
upon
a
dozen
prejudices
during
the
course
of
the
last
half
hour
he
knew
the
tension
of
suspense
before
he
met
her
radiant
answering
smile
oh
my
no
we
friends
right
enough
if
you
have
to
live
with
people
all
the
time
it
easy
enough
to
avoid
the
rubs
i
guess
we
can
agree
to
differ
for
the
few
times
we
likely
to
meet
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hand
to
suppress
a
yawn
those
steps
have
just
about
finished
me
i
all
used
up
do
you
want
to
give
me
some
tea
i
noticed
one
of
those
fuller
stores
in
the
strand
as
we
came
along
let
go
right
back
and
have
a
rest
guest
led
the
way
downwards
feeling
but
indifferently
consoled
an
uncomfortable
depression
weighed
on
him
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
and
sat
with
cornelia
in
a
corner
of
the
it
was
the
first
meal
of
which
he
had
partaken
in
her
company
and
it
gave
a
feeling
of
intimacy
to
face
each
other
across
the
table
to
watch
her
pour
out
tea
with
the
pretty
white
hands
on
which
the
diamond
solitaire
twinkled
meaningly
she
seemed
really
tired
and
for
once
was
content
to
be
silent
while
she
drank
boiling
tea
and
munched
rich
cakes
with
supreme
disregard
of
digestion
as
for
guest
two
phrases
rang
in
his
ears
to
the
exclusion
of
other
thoughts
the
few
times
we
are
likely
to
meet
we
might
be
a
honeymoon
couple
two
suggestions
far
apart
as
the
poles
yet
each
bringing
within
it
a
thrill
of
something
like
fear
he
did
not
wish
to
find
himself
in
the
position
of
bridegroom
to
this
yankee
stranger
the
thought
was
absurd
nevertheless
it
was
distinctly
unpleasant
to
picture
anyone
else
occupying
the
position
it
was
worse
than
unpleasant
it
was
actually
painful
to
think
that
the
friendship
might
be
interrupted
by
a
separation
of
three
thousand
miles
he
sat
staring
at
his
companion
with
the
intensity
which
accompanies
a
preoccupied
mind
until
presently
cornelia
began
to
arch
her
eyebrows
purse
up
her
lips
and
crane
her
head
from
side
to
side
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
was
to
get
up
and
stand
on
that
bench
do
you
think
it
would
aid
your
scrutiny
what
the
verdict
please
it
the
least
you
can
do
to
tell
me
after
quizzing
all
this
time
what
do
you
think
of
my
looks
honestly
mind
without
any
bunkum
i
crazy
to
know
i
think
sometimes
you
are
beautiful
seriously
you
mean
it
i
do
the
golden
eyes
met
his
with
a
flash
of
delight
and
an
arm
was
stretched
impetuously
across
the
table
shake
hands
you
just
the
nicest
thing
to
be
puffectly
candid
i
thought
the
same
once
or
twice
when
i
caught
sight
of
myself
in
a
mirror
at
a
big
moment
when
i
was
all
worked
up
big
moments
are
vury
suiting
but
on
ordinary
days
cornelia
put
a
strong
accent
on
the
penultimate
my
nose
she
closed
one
eye
to
regard
with
the
other
the
sharp
little
tip
of
the
member
in
question
there
no
getting
away
from
it
that
my
nose
is
a
it
a
mean
little
thing
without
a
mite
of
dignity
and
kinder
and
pasty
by
your
english
roses
do
you
think
i
should
look
better
if
my
cheeks
were
pink
like
elma
she
looked
at
him
with
arch
inquiry
and
even
as
she
did
so
either
as
the
result
of
something
which
she
read
in
the
watching
eyes
or
by
the
action
of
some
mysterious
mental
power
the
pink
flamed
in
her
cheek
and
lo
she
was
a
rose
herself
a
wonderful
exotic
rose
flaming
from
red
to
gold
guest
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
hastily
dropped
his
eyes
he
was
not
by
nature
an
impetuous
man
but
he
had
a
conviction
that
if
he
looked
at
cornelia
any
longer
at
this
moment
he
might
say
something
which
he
should
afterwards
regret
he
did
not
answer
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
answer
his
eyes
had
done
that
eloquently
enough
in
that
moment
of
meeting
there
was
a
long
silence
while
guest
mentally
pulled
himself
together
calling
himself
a
fool
for
his
pains
recalling
the
fact
that
by
her
own
confession
cornelia
was
an
accomplished
flirt
steeling
himself
against
her
blandishments
when
presently
he
heard
his
name
pronounced
in
dulcet
tones
he
looked
up
with
his
most
unapproachable
air
cornelia
was
holding
her
plate
towards
him
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
held
a
fragment
of
cake
to
her
lips
another
piece
please
she
commanded
it
the
best
thing
struck
since
i
been
this
side
and
i
going
to
wolf
into
it
for
all
i
worth
ordinary
meals
bore
the
life
out
of
me
but
i
just
wicked
when
i
get
started
on
sweets
guest
signalled
to
a
damsel
in
attendance
and
saw
her
eyes
widen
in
amazement
at
the
renewed
order
she
walked
away
suppressing
a
smile
and
could
be
observed
obviously
retailing
the
incident
to
a
companion
behind
the
counter
it
detracted
woefully
from
the
romance
of
the
situation
to
be
pointed
out
as
a
couple
who
had
demolished
a
large
plateful
of
cakes
and
sent
out
an
order
for
more
chapter
nineteen
before
parting
from
cornelia
at
the
hotel
guest
made
a
point
of
finding
out
her
programme
of
amusements
for
the
next
few
days
as
a
consequence
of
which
he
called
at
a
theatrical
depot
on
his
way
to
his
club
and
secured
an
odd
stall
for
either
night
he
had
already
more
social
engagements
than
he
could
keep
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
possible
to
run
into
the
theatre
for
an
odd
half
hour
and
chat
with
cornelia
during
an
interval
on
his
way
from
one
place
to
another
he
assured
himself
with
much
solemnity
that
it
was
his
duty
to
look
after
the
girl
since
she
had
told
him
that
he
seemed
to
her
like
a
bit
of
home
and
he
had
the
poorest
possible
opinion
of
her
hosts
as
for
cornelia
she
ran
gaily
upstairs
to
her
room
disdaining
the
lift
and
all
with
pleasurable
excitement
from
her
point
of
view
the
afternoon
had
been
an
unmitigated
success
she
had
been
conscious
of
no
jar
being
blandly
indifferent
to
every
opinion
but
her
own
and
was
now
as
in
appreciation
of
her
companion
as
she
had
previously
been
violent
in
denunciation
he
was
just
the
sweetest
thing
and
she
was
going
to
see
him
again
maybe
night
it
felt
like
being
at
home
again
to
have
a
nice
man
hopping
around
she
threw
open
the
door
of
her
room
and
started
with
surprise
to
meet
mrs
moffatt
on
the
threshold
her
arms
piled
high
with
parcels
a
long
narrow
box
lay
on
the
top
and
she
had
an
impression
of
seeing
her
own
name
written
on
the
cover
before
mrs
moffatt
hurried
past
speaking
rapidly
over
her
shoulder
why
cornelia
is
that
you
excuse
me
wo
you
coming
into
your
room
the
stupid
things
have
gotten
the
parcels
all
mixed
up
these
are
the
things
i
ordered
this
morning
come
into
the
parlour
before
you
change
i
want
you
a
moment
she
bustled
down
the
passage
towards
her
own
room
deposited
her
bundles
then
crossed
the
corridor
to
the
where
cornelia
was
already
seated
she
looked
up
as
the
elder
woman
entered
and
thought
she
had
never
seen
her
look
so
worn
and
tired
so
old
despite
the
artificial
colouring
i
afraid
you
not
had
a
good
time
you
look
all
used
up
the
visit
as
nice
as
you
expected
mrs
moffatt
threw
herself
down
on
a
chair
with
a
sigh
of
impatience
oh
my
dear
i
am
so
rattled
every
mortal
thing
gone
wrong
from
start
to
finish
do
ask
me
about
it
for
it
do
bear
speaking
of
my
head
aches
fit
to
split
and
now
silas
has
taken
the
huff
and
marched
off
goodness
knows
where
and
there
a
man
sitting
down
in
the
hall
refusing
to
go
away
until
he
gets
his
money
and
disgracing
me
before
the
whole
hotel
it
for
those
furs
i
had
sent
in
the
other
day
i
decided
to
keep
them
and
mailed
them
to
a
friend
in
the
country
to
house
for
me
i
ca
be
worried
with
a
lot
of
goods
in
a
hotel
so
she
gives
me
until
we
sail
that
where
i
you
see
i
ca
give
him
either
the
goods
or
the
money
and
when
silas
turns
ugly
goodness
only
knows
when
he
may
come
back
maybe
not
till
late
at
night
i
so
mortified
i
do
know
what
to
do
cornelia
laughed
easily
do
you
worry
it
as
easy
as
pie
i
give
you
a
cheque
and
mr
moffatt
can
pay
me
back
in
the
morning
i
go
and
write
it
out
for
you
now
what
the
damage
two
hundred
pounds
fredburg
and
company
you
are
an
angel
cornelia
i
ke
begin
to
thank
you
do
try
please
what
does
it
matter
for
a
few
hours
cried
cornelia
brightly
she
went
into
her
own
room
made
out
the
cheque
and
handed
it
to
her
friend
who
promptly
carried
it
away
to
return
at
the
expiration
of
five
minutes
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
was
one
for
him
he
looked
kinder
small
when
he
saw
your
name
on
the
cheque
it
real
sweet
of
you
dear
and
silas
will
pay
up
like
a
lamb
when
you
are
the
creditor
he
wo
show
his
temper
to
you
as
he
would
to
me
you
are
a
stranger
you
see
and
i
only
his
wife
there
was
an
accent
of
bitterness
in
the
speaker
voice
and
she
leant
her
head
on
her
hands
in
an
attitude
of
profound
dejection
cornelia
had
never
before
been
the
witness
of
so
abandoned
a
mood
but
her
ideas
of
loyalty
were
too
much
outraged
to
permit
of
sympathy
she
held
her
head
erect
and
her
voice
sounded
cold
and
distant
i
just
as
soon
not
hear
any
more
about
mr
moffatt
if
you
mind
he
been
very
kind
to
me
and
it
not
my
business
how
he
behaves
i
guess
a
good
many
men
get
crusty
when
the
bills
come
in
and
you
a
pretty
expensive
wife
i
should
think
you
get
tired
of
prowling
about
those
stores
mrs
moffatt
flushed
and
bit
her
lower
lip
not
attempting
to
defend
herself
but
staring
before
her
with
weary
vacant
eyes
it
was
a
welcome
diversion
when
a
waiter
entered
the
room
carrying
a
tray
with
tea
and
refreshments
and
cornelia
waited
on
her
hostess
with
an
attention
which
was
intended
to
mitigate
her
late
severity
although
a
fuller
acquaintance
of
mrs
moffatt
had
increased
neither
liking
nor
respect
it
had
developed
a
sincere
pity
for
a
woman
whose
life
was
barren
of
purpose
of
interest
apparently
of
love
also
it
was
not
in
cornelia
nature
to
see
anyone
suffer
and
not
try
to
help
and
if
it
had
been
her
own
mother
on
whom
she
was
waiting
she
could
not
have
shown
more
care
and
consideration
a
table
was
placed
by
mrs
moffatt
side
tea
was
made
with
exact
remembrance
of
her
preferences
a
cushion
was
brought
from
a
sofa
to
put
behind
her
back
and
a
footstool
placed
ready
for
her
feet
it
was
while
she
still
knelt
to
put
the
stool
in
position
that
the
elder
woman
at
length
broke
silence
see
here
cornelia
she
cried
suddenly
i
may
have
another
chance
of
talking
to
you
quietly
before
you
go
and
there
something
i
want
to
say
you
are
young
and
rich
and
pretty
and
strong
and
had
a
good
time
all
the
way
through
your
poppar
spoils
you
and
got
just
to
wish
for
a
thing
and
it
there
right
along
i
glad
of
it
for
you
a
real
sweet
girl
but
come
down
too
hard
on
other
it
a
pretty
queer
world
when
you
compare
one
person
luck
with
another
i
not
going
to
tell
you
all
i
come
through
but
it
not
been
too
easy
at
times
i
been
to
blame
and
at
times
i
have
i
do
know
as
it
makes
much
difference
anyway
the
end
the
same
seems
to
you
i
a
pretty
poor
thing
but
you
know
how
you
have
been
yourself
cornelia
if
you
come
along
the
same
road
you
got
to
remember
that
before
you
judge
that
so
assented
cornelia
gravely
she
was
too
straight
to
deny
an
insinuation
which
was
all
too
true
but
at
the
same
time
she
felt
an
acute
regret
and
embarrassment
in
the
thought
that
a
woman
so
much
older
than
herself
should
feel
it
necessary
to
make
such
a
confession
of
unworthiness
i
ought
to
be
a
heap
better
than
i
am
for
there
anyone
living
that
had
a
better
time
we
had
spells
when
had
bad
luck
and
the
money
been
short
but
we
were
as
happy
as
grigs
planning
out
how
we
spend
the
next
pile
so
long
as
you
can
get
along
it
does
matter
much
about
the
extras
when
you
as
happy
together
as
we
are
poppar
and
i
mrs
moffatt
sighed
once
more
i
never
knew
my
parents
they
died
when
i
was
a
baby
and
i
was
raised
among
strangers
who
put
up
with
me
for
the
sake
of
the
pay
love
never
came
my
way
somehow
i
suppose
some
folks
would
say
that
was
my
own
fault
there
was
a
man
i
could
have
cared
for
but
he
did
want
me
and
i
married
silas
for
a
change
to
get
away
from
the
dull
old
life
you
be
careful
who
you
marry
cornelia
you
the
sort
of
girl
who
does
things
pretty
thoroughly
either
way
there
no
middle
course
for
you
you
bound
to
be
either
blissful
or
wretched
you
got
enough
money
of
your
own
so
you
can
afford
to
choose
lucky
girl
is
it
going
to
be
that
captain
guest
suttenly
not
cornelia
rose
to
her
feet
and
walked
back
to
the
table
very
stiff
in
the
back
and
pink
in
the
cheeks
she
was
angry
with
herself
for
blushing
and
the
fact
naturally
made
her
blush
the
more
i
told
you
before
that
we
have
only
met
once
or
twice
and
half
the
time
has
been
taken
up
in
quarrelling
we
are
too
different
ever
to
run
together
in
double
harness
well
i
sorry
he
got
lots
of
frills
but
he
looks
the
right
sort
all
the
same
i
sorry
you
ought
to
have
a
good
man
cornelia
mrs
moffatt
pushed
aside
her
cup
of
tea
and
rose
wearily
to
her
feet
well
i
guess
i
go
and
dress
we
have
some
champagne
for
dinner
and
that
will
perk
us
up
for
the
theatre
they
say
it
a
real
good
play
and
we
shall
only
be
together
two
more
nights
so
i
want
you
to
have
a
good
time
it
seems
mean
not
to
ask
you
to
stay
on
but
our
plans
are
all
uncertain
we
may
be
off
ourselves
any
time
now
silas
never
settles
down
for
more
than
a
few
days
cornelia
gave
the
politely
inaudible
murmur
usual
on
such
occasions
much
as
she
had
enjoyed
the
stay
in
town
she
could
not
pretend
to
regret
the
prospect
of
returning
to
norton
later
on
she
would
make
a
longer
visit
to
town
in
poppar
company
but
even
if
the
invitation
were
given
she
could
not
consent
to
remain
any
longer
the
guest
of
mrs
silas
p
moffatt
she
was
a
woman
whom
it
was
impossible
to
respect
and
to
cornelia
respect
was
a
necessary
foundation
to
friendship
silas
did
not
count
he
was
a
little
misery
to
be
regarded
only
as
an
adjunct
to
his
wife
she
was
even
surprised
to
hear
that
he
was
capable
of
exhibiting
in
any
case
it
seemed
to
be
as
dinner
found
him
in
his
usual
place
and
then
and
throughout
the
evening
he
was
if
anything
a
trifle
more
animated
than
usual
thanking
cornelia
warmly
for
helping
his
wife
out
of
an
awkward
position
and
regretting
that
in
the
rush
to
the
theatre
there
was
not
time
to
discharge
the
debt
forthwith
but
we
must
settle
up
after
breakfast
short
accounts
make
long
friends
he
declared
smilingly
as
he
helped
her
to
put
on
her
cloak
cornelia
had
dressed
with
a
vivid
remembrance
of
the
fact
that
captain
guest
had
never
seen
her
in
evening
attire
and
a
determination
to
secure
a
big
moment
for
his
benefit
when
an
hour
or
two
later
he
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
stalls
and
caught
sight
of
her
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
front
row
it
seemed
at
first
sight
that
she
was
clad
entirely
in
black
but
even
as
he
was
applauding
the
choice
for
the
display
of
ruddy
locks
and
snowy
shoulders
she
made
a
sudden
movement
and
lo
the
black
was
transformed
into
vivid
glittering
green
now
she
was
conspicuous
too
conspicuous
to
please
his
fastidious
taste
he
could
see
levelled
on
her
from
the
boxes
overhead
and
over
the
edge
of
the
dress
circle
she
sat
well
forward
in
her
stall
with
head
thrown
back
and
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stage
in
absorbed
attention
there
was
no
doubting
the
unconsciousness
of
the
pose
she
was
as
oblivious
of
the
gaze
of
others
as
of
his
own
presence
but
he
felt
an
irritated
longing
to
muffle
her
in
veils
and
wrappings
to
lift
her
up
and
transplant
her
to
the
back
seat
in
a
box
what
business
had
those
idiots
to
stare
at
her
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
actresses
on
the
stage
he
branded
the
idiots
with
even
stronger
titles
the
while
he
continued
to
follow
their
example
surely
it
was
a
forgivable
sin
to
be
conspicuously
attractive
to
stand
out
vivid
and
dazzling
from
the
surrounding
throng
whose
chief
characteristics
seemed
to
be
a
bleached
inanity
and
indifference
guest
stood
in
the
shadow
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
girl
with
unblinking
scrutiny
he
remembered
that
such
a
gaze
was
said
to
demand
a
response
where
a
certain
amount
of
affinity
existed
between
the
people
involved
and
put
out
his
strength
to
try
the
truth
of
the
statement
in
his
own
case
the
proof
came
almost
startlingly
soon
cornelia
head
turned
over
her
shoulder
and
her
eyes
lightened
with
a
flash
of
recognition
she
smiled
at
him
nodded
her
head
and
arched
her
brows
signalling
a
message
which
he
could
easily
divine
to
be
an
invitation
to
come
to
speak
to
her
between
the
acts
when
the
curtain
fell
mr
moffatt
made
an
immediate
rush
for
the
door
and
guest
took
possession
of
his
seat
devoutly
thankful
that
it
did
not
happen
to
adjoin
that
of
the
other
lady
of
the
party
i
very
pleased
to
meet
you
again
seems
quite
a
good
time
since
we
parted
said
cornelia
gaily
her
hair
stood
out
round
her
head
like
a
halo
of
gold
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
her
cheeks
were
softly
pink
guest
was
dazzled
by
the
bizarre
beauty
of
her
she
wore
no
jewels
not
so
much
as
a
chain
round
her
neck
and
the
dress
by
some
witchery
was
black
once
more
a
thin
black
gauze
heavily
jetted
he
pointed
at
it
with
a
curious
finger
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
green
over
there
what
has
happened
to
turn
it
into
black
cornelia
laughed
complacently
it
meant
to
change
there
are
skirts
and
skirts
ever
so
many
of
them
on
top
of
each
other
and
each
one
is
different
they
all
get
a
chance
at
times
it
the
vury
latest
craze
mrs
moffatt
nearly
killed
me
when
she
saw
it
a
chameleon
effect
i
see
is
it
supposed
to
be
symbolic
of
me
i
guess
not
when
i
made
up
my
mind
i
there
no
chopping
about
for
this
child
it
was
extraordinary
how
illusion
vanished
at
the
sound
of
the
pitched
nasal
voice
the
fairy
princess
vanished
and
in
her
place
sat
a
damsel
composed
complacent
and
guest
felt
again
the
intrusion
of
a
jarring
note
he
would
have
liked
cornelia
to
welcome
him
with
a
flutter
of
embarrassment
to
have
seen
her
eyes
droop
before
his
and
hear
a
quiver
in
her
voice
he
wanted
to
realise
that
he
was
the
natural
head
and
protector
and
she
the
woman
the
weak
clinging
creature
whose
happy
destiny
it
was
to
be
the
helpmeet
of
man
but
as
cornelia
herself
would
have
phrased
it
there
was
no
cling
to
her
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
think
of
protection
in
connection
with
a
creature
so
jauntily
and
independent
he
sat
by
her
side
until
the
conclusion
of
the
interval
but
the
conversation
was
forced
and
uninteresting
and
he
rose
to
depart
with
the
depressing
consciousness
that
the
interview
had
been
a
failure
since
it
left
him
less
in
sympathy
with
cornelia
than
he
had
been
in
the
afternoon
on
his
way
to
the
door
guest
eyes
caught
the
signal
of
a
warning
fan
and
he
looked
up
to
see
one
of
the
boxes
occupied
by
a
party
of
his
own
friends
he
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
cornelia
to
look
around
the
audience
but
now
it
was
impossible
to
leave
the
theatre
without
going
upstairs
a
few
minutes
after
the
ordinary
greetings
complaints
of
the
heat
and
comparisons
of
engagements
followed
the
inevitable
question
who
is
miss
rossetti
i
beg
your
pardon
your
friend
in
the
stalls
the
girl
with
the
wonderful
hair
she
an
american
a
miss
briskett
over
from
the
states
on
a
short
visit
i
met
her
lately
down
in
the
country
and
we
happened
to
strike
the
same
week
for
a
visit
to
town
lucky
for
you
i
been
admiring
her
all
night
that
hair
and
skin
and
the
glittering
frock
quite
bewitching
where
is
she
staying
at
the
ritz
with
some
people
she
met
coming
over
she
knows
no
one
over
here
the
good
lady
interest
appeased
she
turned
back
to
the
stage
fluttering
her
fan
to
and
fro
attracted
by
its
movement
or
by
the
glances
focussed
upon
her
cornelia
tilted
her
head
upwards
recognised
guest
and
whispered
to
her
companion
mr
moffatt
eyes
travelled
obediently
towards
the
box
to
fasten
not
on
guest
but
on
the
man
by
his
side
for
a
moment
they
widened
in
unmistakable
recognition
before
of
set
purpose
as
it
were
they
grew
blank
and
lifeless
he
bowed
slightly
to
guest
and
turned
back
to
the
stage
the
man
by
guest
side
laughed
drily
and
followed
him
out
into
the
corridor
look
here
guest
he
said
shortly
if
that
girl
is
a
friend
of
yours
and
is
staying
in
a
hotel
here
with
those
people
you
better
advise
her
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
that
man
a
bad
egg
i
ran
up
against
him
in
marienbad
last
year
he
and
his
wife
made
the
hotel
too
hot
to
hold
them
and
were
politely
requested
to
leave
there
was
nothing
definite
proved
but
too
many
shady
things
to
be
pleasant
he
had
an
extraordinary
facility
for
winning
at
cards
and
the
fair
mrs
schuter
by
the
way
her
hair
was
brown
at
that
time
these
people
are
called
moffatt
perhaps
you
are
mistaking
them
for
somebody
else
guest
interrupted
eagerly
but
he
knew
the
futility
of
his
hope
before
he
heard
the
reply
no
doubt
they
have
half
a
dozen
aliases
what
does
it
matter
what
they
choose
to
call
themselves
you
saw
for
yourself
that
the
man
recognised
me
just
now
sorry
to
interfere
you
know
and
all
that
but
i
be
nailing
sorry
to
leave
any
girl
i
knew
in
such
a
caravansary
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
thanks
very
much
you
are
perfectly
right
i
send
her
off
morrow
said
guest
firmly
as
he
walked
down
the
steps
again
he
was
smouldering
with
fury
with
an
impulse
to
walk
into
the
theatre
denounce
the
adventurers
to
their
faces
and
bear
cornelia
away
to
a
place
of
safety
for
all
her
assurance
events
had
proved
that
she
was
neither
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
nor
of
choosing
her
own
companions
she
had
been
led
away
by
impulse
like
other
girls
he
liked
her
the
more
not
the
less
for
the
discovery
and
his
heart
softened
at
the
thought
of
her
disillusion
no
use
to
worry
her
night
let
her
have
a
good
night
rest
and
morning
bright
and
early
he
would
go
round
to
the
hotel
when
mr
and
mrs
schuter
or
moffatt
or
whatever
their
name
happened
to
be
would
once
more
find
their
quarters
too
hot
to
hold
them
chapter
twenty
on
returning
to
the
hotel
that
evening
mr
moffatt
announced
that
he
and
his
wife
had
business
on
hand
next
morning
which
would
necessitate
an
early
breakfast
and
that
once
again
they
would
be
obliged
to
leave
cornelia
to
her
own
resources
he
suggested
however
that
they
should
all
meet
at
paddington
station
at
two
whence
they
could
take
train
to
maidenhead
for
an
afternoon
on
the
river
cornelia
hailed
the
prospect
with
delight
and
mentally
dedicated
the
morning
to
doing
a
and
to
choosing
a
suitable
present
for
her
aunt
and
elma
ramsden
aunt
soph
should
have
lace
something
soft
and
smooth
and
womanly
to
take
the
place
of
the
prickly
steel
trimmings
which
seemed
to
constitute
her
one
idea
of
adornment
elma
dear
thing
what
should
be
chosen
for
her
not
clothes
it
would
not
be
good
taste
to
offer
another
gift
of
the
kind
a
piece
of
jewellery
would
be
best
something
good
and
quiet
and
unobtrusive
suitable
for
the
wear
of
a
nice
young
girl
cornelia
chuckled
to
herself
in
prospective
enjoyment
next
morning
as
she
repaired
to
the
private
of
the
suite
where
breakfast
was
invariably
served
her
host
and
hostess
had
already
risen
from
the
table
and
were
dressed
for
walking
mrs
moffatt
stood
before
the
window
looking
down
into
the
street
with
a
pale
and
worried
expression
her
husband
was
scribbling
at
a
side
table
but
jumped
up
at
entrance
as
if
he
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
her
appearance
ah
miss
briskett
we
are
just
off
but
i
wanted
to
settle
up
with
you
first
here
the
cheque
with
many
thanks
perhaps
you
will
kindly
look
over
it
to
see
it
is
all
right
oh
mr
moffatt
you
should
not
have
troubled
when
you
were
so
hustled
it
too
good
of
you
cried
cornelia
eagerly
her
heart
warming
to
the
little
man
for
a
promptitude
in
money
matters
which
reminded
her
of
her
own
beloved
poppar
of
course
it
all
right
she
cast
a
casual
glance
over
the
cheque
and
broke
into
a
surprised
laugh
it
is
though
you
paid
me
too
much
i
guess
i
not
a
usurer
to
want
interest
for
a
single
night
it
was
only
two
hundred
that
i
lent
mr
moffatt
gave
an
exclamation
of
irritation
and
i
have
made
it
out
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
how
very
annoying
i
have
advised
it
to
the
bank
too
and
sent
off
the
letter
i
wanted
to
get
through
with
as
much
business
as
possible
this
morning
the
more
hurry
the
less
speed
why
on
earth
could
you
not
give
me
the
right
figures
gertrude
he
turned
upon
his
wife
with
an
expression
of
querulous
anger
which
she
treated
with
her
usual
cool
disdain
i
tell
you
silas
but
for
the
land
sake
do
make
a
fuss
it
simple
enough
cornelia
can
give
me
the
change
in
notes
and
it
will
do
to
pay
up
one
or
two
odd
accounts
before
we
leave
you
mind
dear
i
know
and
see
here
i
fairly
rattled
this
morning
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
through
i
written
out
a
list
of
errands
that
ought
to
be
done
right
away
as
soon
as
you
gotten
through
breakfast
the
particulars
are
down
on
this
list
and
i
be
for
ever
obliged
you
ought
to
get
through
before
one
if
you
start
soon
so
meet
me
at
buzzard
and
we
have
lunch
together
in
case
i
should
be
late
do
wait
but
just
order
for
yourself
and
allow
half
an
hour
to
get
to
paddington
if
i
delayed
i
go
straight
there
and
look
out
for
you
on
our
platform
that
be
all
right
i
stay
till
you
come
cornelia
assented
she
had
already
opened
the
gold
chain
bag
which
hung
by
her
side
and
was
a
roll
of
notes
two
fives
two
tens
i
guess
all
i
can
do
this
morning
i
give
you
the
rest
oh
my
yes
there
no
hurry
thank
you
dear
much
obliged
said
mrs
moffatt
lightly
but
her
expression
altered
as
she
spoke
cornelia
wondered
if
she
were
imagining
a
look
of
disappointment
it
be
imagination
for
of
what
importance
were
a
trumpery
hundred
dollars
to
a
woman
who
daily
squandered
many
times
the
amount
on
her
own
adornment
after
the
moffatts
had
departed
cornelia
ate
her
breakfast
and
set
out
in
a
hansom
to
accomplish
mrs
moffatt
commissions
before
proceeding
to
shop
on
her
own
account
she
handed
the
driver
the
list
of
addresses
which
she
was
asked
to
visit
in
town
and
wondered
at
his
expression
of
astonishment
but
she
wondered
no
longer
as
they
traversed
mile
after
mile
of
dreary
roadways
to
find
on
arriving
at
the
first
destination
that
as
great
a
distance
still
separated
it
from
the
second
on
the
list
the
commissions
themselves
were
trivial
and
unimportant
at
which
cornelia
was
not
surprised
after
her
personal
experience
of
mrs
moffatt
shopping
eccentricities
but
when
she
had
wasted
a
couple
of
hours
driving
to
and
fro
for
no
tangible
result
she
waxed
impatient
determined
that
she
had
done
enough
for
the
honour
of
friendship
and
that
mrs
moffatt
could
herself
finish
the
remaining
transactions
she
therefore
directed
the
driver
to
take
her
to
the
jeweller
shop
in
bond
street
where
she
had
made
her
previous
purchases
and
anticipated
a
pleasant
half
hour
choosing
an
ornament
which
would
commend
itself
to
elma
approval
the
partner
in
the
firm
welcomed
her
with
his
usual
empressement
mingled
with
a
certain
surprise
for
which
she
was
at
a
loss
to
account
although
a
keen
tradesman
pearl
brooches
and
bangles
seemed
this
morning
too
trivial
matters
to
engross
his
attention
he
had
the
air
of
waiting
momentarily
to
discuss
a
more
important
subject
and
presently
introduced
it
himself
unable
to
be
longer
silent
i
despatched
a
messenger
to
the
hotel
an
hour
ago
with
the
emerald
necklace
mrs
moffatt
informed
him
that
you
were
not
in
at
the
moment
but
would
be
able
to
see
him
at
she
was
probably
unaware
that
you
intended
to
call
yourself
yes
she
was
it
does
matter
a
mite
so
long
as
she
was
there
it
all
right
cornelia
replied
turning
over
the
tray
of
ornaments
absently
it
seemed
odd
that
mrs
moffatt
should
have
returned
to
the
hotel
after
representing
that
she
was
obliged
to
be
absent
all
morning
but
no
doubt
some
engagement
had
fallen
through
which
she
had
intended
to
keep
she
had
lifted
a
brooch
in
her
hands
and
turned
towards
the
window
to
examine
the
colour
of
the
pearls
when
the
jeweller
spoke
again
we
were
delighted
to
receive
your
agreement
to
take
the
necklace
for
as
mrs
moffatt
had
definitely
decided
that
it
was
beyond
her
figure
we
were
on
the
point
of
sending
it
over
to
our
paris
house
i
am
sure
mr
briskett
will
not
regret
this
purchase
when
he
sees
the
quality
of
the
stones
cornelia
stood
staring
hard
at
the
little
pearl
brooch
a
hundred
vague
doubts
and
dreads
which
had
previously
been
resolutely
thrust
aside
darting
back
into
her
mind
with
a
new
and
terrible
significance
she
felt
stunned
and
bewildered
but
the
predominant
sensation
was
the
necessity
for
caution
she
must
be
certain
of
what
had
happened
before
she
presumed
to
judge
she
rallied
all
her
possession
and
was
surprised
at
the
natural
sound
of
her
own
voice
as
she
replied
what
makes
you
speak
of
my
father
mr
marchant
did
i
mention
to
you
at
any
time
that
he
was
fond
of
emeralds
i
believe
you
did
on
one
occasion
but
it
was
your
reference
this
morning
to
which
i
alluded
mr
marchant
drew
out
his
and
selected
one
letter
from
the
contents
this
is
it
i
think
yes
you
say
have
just
received
a
cable
permission
from
my
father
mr
edward
b
briskett
to
purchase
the
emerald
necklace
i
was
referring
to
this
quotation
rather
than
any
casual
remark
cornelia
leant
over
the
counter
and
read
the
words
with
her
own
eyes
saw
the
signature
of
her
own
name
written
below
in
mrs
handwriting
why
of
course
i
forgot
i
never
do
remember
what
i
write
she
said
calmly
she
was
sure
now
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
for
doubt
the
everlasting
shopping
expeditions
the
purchase
of
a
succession
of
worthless
trifles
the
exploiting
of
her
own
wealth
had
all
been
designed
to
create
a
confidence
which
would
prepare
the
way
for
such
a
as
the
present
and
this
morning
she
had
been
deliberately
decoyed
out
of
the
way
while
the
last
scene
of
the
comedy
was
enacted
the
messages
were
plainly
a
ruse
while
the
different
rendezvous
would
have
provided
a
further
detention
allowing
the
conspirators
plenty
of
time
to
decamp
once
opened
cornelia
eyes
were
wonderfully
keen
she
understood
now
why
the
goods
which
it
was
inconvenient
to
harbour
in
a
hotel
had
been
constantly
despatched
to
the
keeping
of
a
friend
she
realised
that
she
had
been
cheated
doubly
cheated
in
first
giving
a
cheque
for
two
hundred
pounds
and
afterwards
in
counting
out
change
for
a
worthless
return
i
need
never
fancy
myself
again
after
this
i
just
the
greenest
peach
on
the
wall
she
told
herself
furiously
but
through
all
the
anger
and
shock
the
necessity
for
caution
remained
predominant
in
her
mind
mr
marchant
must
not
suspect
that
anything
was
wrong
even
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
fraud
might
be
prevented
she
must
get
back
to
the
hotel
at
once
see
mrs
moffatt
and
reason
with
her
argue
with
her
command
her
to
hand
over
the
jewels
the
woman
was
not
all
bad
and
life
had
gone
hardly
with
her
she
should
have
another
chance
cornelia
waived
aside
all
thought
of
responsibility
toward
the
jeweller
himself
by
the
easy
decision
to
pay
for
the
necklace
if
necessary
but
a
sudden
feeling
of
helplessness
weighed
upon
her
at
the
prospect
of
the
interview
ahead
suppose
mr
moffatt
were
at
the
hotel
with
his
wife
then
there
would
be
two
to
one
and
once
the
outer
veneer
was
broken
through
there
was
no
saying
to
what
extremes
of
abuse
of
threatening
even
of
violence
itself
they
might
descend
cornelia
recalled
the
two
faces
the
woman
hard
sullen
coarse
the
man
mean
and
crafty
and
shuddered
at
the
prospect
all
at
once
the
thought
of
guest
occurred
to
bring
with
it
a
wave
of
relief
guest
had
begged
her
to
summon
him
if
at
any
time
he
should
be
needed
now
the
need
had
arisen
and
he
should
help
her
through
she
hastily
selected
a
pearl
bangle
and
laid
it
on
one
side
on
the
counter
i
will
decide
on
that
let
your
man
bring
it
round
at
five
and
ask
to
see
me
personally
he
can
bring
a
bill
made
out
for
all
i
owe
and
i
settle
at
once
and
mr
marchant
i
want
to
use
your
telephone
can
you
ring
and
have
me
switched
on
to
the
army
and
navy
club
while
the
preliminary
operations
were
going
on
at
the
telephone
cornelia
racked
her
brain
to
think
of
a
suitable
rendezvous
and
failing
a
better
suggestion
decided
on
a
exactly
across
the
road
to
her
immense
relief
guest
was
found
at
his
club
and
announced
that
he
would
be
with
her
in
ten
minutes
time
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
dismiss
the
hansom
and
secure
a
table
in
a
quiet
corner
the
time
seemed
long
but
in
reality
it
was
less
than
ten
minutes
before
guest
seated
himself
by
her
side
he
looked
grave
and
stern
preoccupied
almost
to
the
point
of
discourtesy
for
the
ordinary
greetings
were
exchanged
for
a
succession
of
short
eager
questions
where
have
you
been
all
the
morning
have
you
been
back
to
the
hotel
did
you
get
my
message
i
did
not
i
been
out
since
about
nine
what
was
the
message
about
anything
important
tell
me
first
what
you
wanted
me
for
just
now
cornelia
paused
for
a
moment
and
her
lips
trembled
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
leant
across
the
little
table
staring
earnestly
into
his
eyes
captain
guest
i
in
trouble
i
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
myself
as
a
rule
but
i
ke
see
it
through
alone
it
going
to
be
one
of
the
meanest
businesses
you
ever
touched
will
you
help
me
i
will
said
guest
quietly
thank
you
for
asking
me
is
it
excuse
my
asking
anything
in
connection
with
mr
and
mrs
moffatt
ah
as
the
girl
exclaimed
in
sharp
surprise
i
fancied
that
last
meeting
might
bring
things
to
a
crisis
now
i
tell
you
just
what
happened
in
that
box
and
then
you
must
tell
me
your
story
for
the
next
ten
minutes
they
sat
with
heads
bent
close
together
exchanging
confidences
of
grave
import
cornelia
kept
nothing
back
and
as
he
listened
guest
face
grew
momentarily
sterner
the
hastily
ordered
meal
lay
neglected
on
the
table
while
they
faced
the
desperate
situation
with
which
they
had
to
deal
guest
took
a
man
view
of
the
case
and
was
strongly
in
favour
of
apprising
mr
marchant
of
what
had
happened
and
returning
to
the
hotel
supported
not
only
by
him
but
by
a
police
officer
into
the
bargain
but
cornelia
would
not
be
induced
to
agree
she
done
wrong
and
she
forged
my
name
for
her
own
purposes
no
getting
away
from
that
but
there
may
be
some
explanation
which
will
make
it
look
a
little
less
black
anyway
i
going
to
hear
it
before
i
judge
and
if
she
make
things
good
i
give
her
another
chance
you
do
know
what
come
before
this
i
should
have
little
difficulty
in
guessing
however
guest
said
drily
he
thought
of
the
hotel
in
marienbad
of
the
changed
name
the
dyed
hair
and
mentally
conjured
up
the
dreary
life
of
plotting
and
scheming
of
constant
danger
and
miserable
success
which
constitutes
the
life
of
the
professional
adventurer
but
cornelia
saw
only
the
haggard
face
which
had
looked
at
her
in
the
of
the
hotel
the
face
of
the
woman
whose
childhood
had
known
no
home
whom
love
had
passed
by
she
heard
again
the
hopeless
intonation
of
the
voice
which
had
reminded
her
you
have
to
tread
the
same
road
yourself
before
you
could
judge
me
cornelia
her
chin
squared
with
the
look
of
stubborn
determination
which
her
aunt
already
knew
so
well
and
she
said
firmly
well
anyway
i
got
to
see
her
first
if
you
do
approve
i
go
alone
but
i
like
best
to
have
you
there
of
course
i
come
there
no
question
about
that
we
had
better
get
off
at
once
then
and
not
waste
any
more
time
but
first
you
must
have
something
to
eat
you
been
driving
about
all
morning
and
there
trouble
ahead
i
ring
for
something
hot
and
tempting
what
would
you
like
best
i
could
swallow
a
bite
if
you
paid
me
for
it
it
would
stick
in
my
throat
have
a
glass
of
wine
then
i
not
going
to
stir
till
you
have
something
you
look
tired
out
i
never
touch
wine
i
think
perhaps
i
could
drink
some
cornelia
said
doubtfully
and
guest
stern
face
suddenly
lightened
into
a
smile
coffee
the
worst
thing
possible
for
your
nerves
you
funny
little
girl
you
have
not
the
smallest
glimmering
of
an
idea
how
to
take
care
of
yourself
to
his
surprise
and
alarm
two
big
tears
brimmed
up
suddenly
in
cornelia
eyes
and
her
lips
quivered
do
be
good
to
me
she
whispered
sharply
for
two
straws
i
howl
i
all
worked
up
take
me
out
out
into
the
street
quick
before
i
make
a
scene
guest
needed
no
second
bidding
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
untasted
meal
was
paid
for
a
hansom
summoned
and
he
was
driving
once
more
through
the
streets
by
cornelia
side
while
she
mopped
her
eyes
with
a
minute
have
lived
with
her
for
days
at
a
time
thought
of
her
as
a
friend
have
had
her
nurse
you
when
you
were
sick
thank
heaven
for
that
ejaculated
guest
devoutly
it
was
ridiculous
to
indulge
in
sentiment
in
connection
with
a
thief
and
a
forger
the
woman
deserved
no
mercy
and
would
receive
none
if
he
had
his
way
none
the
less
was
he
charmed
by
cornelia
emotion
by
her
pity
her
amazing
inconsistency
gone
were
her
airs
of
complacency
and
independence
at
the
first
threatening
of
danger
the
pretty
pretence
was
broken
up
weak
trembling
tearful
she
summoned
her
natural
protector
to
her
side
guest
heart
swelled
with
a
passion
of
tenderness
in
his
immaculate
trousers
and
irreproachable
silk
hat
he
was
as
truly
a
at
that
moment
as
any
mailed
warrior
of
old
going
forth
to
fight
a
tourney
for
his
lady
favour
do
cry
he
cried
eagerly
look
here
you
know
if
you
want
me
to
let
her
down
lightly
you
must
pull
yourself
together
i
ca
stand
this
if
you
cry
any
more
i
cornelia
swallowed
dismally
blinking
the
tears
from
her
eyelids
i
do
know
as
it
would
be
the
best
way
out
as
far
as
concerned
but
i
just
as
lief
you
did
turn
criminals
on
my
hands
i
pull
myself
up
once
we
are
there
but
i
all
of
a
flutter
thinking
it
over
in
advance
we
be
there
soon
now
guest
told
her
reassuringly
they
drove
in
silence
down
the
length
of
bond
street
and
out
into
the
whirl
of
piccadilly
soon
almost
too
soon
for
cornelia
jangled
nerves
they
had
drawn
up
before
the
great
door
of
the
hotel
here
nothing
of
a
sensational
nature
had
occurred
the
porter
touched
his
cap
to
cornelia
with
his
usual
stolid
air
the
clerk
bowed
with
unruffled
complacence
no
hint
of
trouble
had
come
to
their
ears
the
lift
was
full
of
a
laughing
chattering
crowd
it
seemed
to
cornelia
almost
incredible
that
these
women
were
repairing
to
their
rooms
to
deck
themselves
for
fresh
pleasures
while
she
was
about
to
bring
a
prisoner
to
the
bar
she
turned
towards
guest
as
he
stood
by
her
side
and
felt
a
fresh
sense
of
comfort
in
his
nearness
his
bigness
his
air
of
quiet
strength
on
the
second
floor
the
lift
discharged
half
its
occupants
a
merry
flock
for
the
most
part
hurrying
along
the
corridor
laughing
and
jesting
as
they
went
while
two
followed
gravely
behind
looking
to
right
and
left
with
anxious
eyes
the
door
of
mrs
moffatt
bedroom
was
closed
was
it
already
deserted
its
drawers
and
wardrobes
despoiled
of
their
treasures
a
bundle
of
worthless
trifles
left
behind
cornelia
heart
beat
in
sickening
throbs
she
knew
a
coward
wish
that
she
might
be
too
late
to
pay
up
and
go
quietly
home
seemed
an
easy
way
out
of
the
difficulty
into
which
she
had
walked
so
blindly
she
drew
a
quick
frightened
breath
and
felt
guest
hand
press
protectingly
on
her
arm
the
door
opened
and
side
by
side
they
entered
the
room
chapter
twenty
one
mrs
moffatt
was
standing
before
the
table
tearing
up
old
papers
she
looked
up
with
a
start
to
see
guest
and
cornelia
standing
before
her
in
that
eloquent
linked
attitude
and
over
her
features
there
passed
that
helpless
trapped
expression
of
guilt
discovered
and
brought
to
bay
which
once
seen
can
never
be
forgotten
the
blood
ebbed
from
her
face
leaving
it
ashen
white
except
for
two
fixed
spots
of
colour
on
either
cheek
her
fingers
relaxed
their
hold
and
the
fragments
of
paper
fluttered
downward
to
the
floor
there
was
a
ghastly
silence
it
was
guest
who
was
the
first
to
speak
standing
straight
and
stern
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
at
the
sound
of
his
opening
words
the
wretched
woman
trembled
violently
and
sank
on
a
chair
for
support
mrs
schuter
i
have
come
here
with
miss
briskett
to
ask
your
explanation
of
a
letter
sent
in
her
name
to
mr
marchant
the
jeweller
this
morning
she
has
seen
the
letter
with
the
forged
signature
at
the
end
and
has
heard
that
the
necklace
was
brought
to
this
hotel
and
delivered
to
you
may
i
trouble
you
to
hand
it
over
each
word
was
sharp
and
cutting
as
an
icicle
and
guest
eyes
were
alight
with
remorseless
anger
cornelia
turned
her
head
aside
unable
to
endure
the
pitiful
spectacle
mrs
moffatt
stammered
out
a
broken
subterfuge
what
necklace
i
do
know
i
do
understand
even
as
she
spoke
one
trembling
hand
twitched
upward
to
be
as
quickly
lowered
but
not
before
guest
had
pounced
upon
the
clue
with
swift
intuition
you
understand
very
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
are
wearing
it
at
this
moment
beneath
your
dress
will
you
kindly
take
it
off
and
put
it
on
the
table
he
turned
aside
as
he
spoke
paying
this
small
tribute
to
her
womanly
feelings
a
strangled
sob
broke
the
silence
the
sound
of
laboured
breathing
then
a
faint
clicking
sound
and
he
looked
round
to
see
a
dazzle
of
light
on
a
corner
of
the
table
where
the
sunbeams
had
found
a
plaything
a
bauble
of
green
and
white
stones
for
which
a
woman
had
sold
her
soul
cornelia
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
guest
realised
that
it
was
her
sob
which
he
had
heard
and
the
knowledge
did
not
soften
his
heart
thank
you
he
said
in
the
same
tone
of
cutting
politeness
that
is
so
much
to
the
good
but
i
shall
have
to
trouble
you
still
further
there
was
two
hundred
pounds
lent
to
you
yesterday
ostensibly
to
be
paid
to
a
furrier
that
of
course
was
a
mere
excuse
and
thirty
pounds
in
this
morning
i
fear
the
first
sum
is
gone
beyond
recall
since
your
husband
cheque
is
probably
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
is
written
but
i
take
it
that
the
notes
are
still
intact
as
you
prefer
someone
else
to
pay
your
bills
you
will
have
kept
them
for
personal
use
they
are
probably
in
your
pocket
at
this
moment
i
have
not
got
the
cheque
i
could
not
return
it
if
i
would
said
mrs
moffatt
hoarsely
my
husband
cashed
it
as
soon
as
the
bank
was
open
and
left
london
shortly
after
he
has
the
money
i
have
not
had
a
cent
of
it
the
notes
are
in
my
purse
he
left
them
so
that
i
should
be
able
to
follow
just
so
you
will
please
return
them
to
miss
briskett
and
we
will
deal
with
the
other
sum
later
on
your
intention
was
to
leave
the
hotel
for
good
this
morning
and
you
provided
miss
briskett
with
commissions
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
while
you
made
your
preparations
that
is
the
case
is
it
not
the
woman
did
not
answer
but
looked
across
the
room
towards
where
cornelia
stood
and
cornelia
parted
her
hands
and
looked
back
at
her
in
pitiful
inquiry
you
mean
to
run
away
and
leave
me
here
alone
mrs
moffatt
bent
her
head
in
shame
her
face
was
not
white
now
but
deep
burning
red
we
knew
after
last
night
that
the
game
was
up
we
to
go
cornelia
or
be
kind
enough
not
to
address
miss
briskett
by
her
christian
name
interrupted
guest
sharply
it
seemed
to
him
an
impossible
humiliation
that
this
woman
should
still
dare
to
address
the
girl
in
the
language
of
friendship
let
us
get
to
the
end
of
this
business
i
presume
there
are
other
bills
which
will
come
in
in
due
course
bills
for
goods
ordered
in
other
forged
notes
am
i
right
in
supposing
this
it
is
your
best
plan
to
speak
the
truth
there
more
bills
can
you
give
me
an
approximate
idea
of
their
amount
fifty
pounds
one
hundred
two
hundred
what
is
the
amount
about
one
hundred
and
the
hotel
expenses
miss
briskett
suspects
from
the
manner
of
the
officials
that
you
were
thoughtful
enough
to
take
these
rooms
in
her
name
again
i
ask
you
is
that
the
case
a
bend
of
the
head
gave
assent
and
guest
wheeled
round
with
a
gesture
of
intense
indignation
took
a
few
rapid
strides
up
and
down
the
room
then
halted
again
by
mrs
moffatt
side
and
not
content
with
cheating
and
plotting
to
desert
this
young
girl
whom
you
professed
to
befriend
how
many
of
her
personal
possessions
have
you
stolen
you
had
free
access
to
her
room
have
you
taken
advantage
of
her
absence
this
morning
to
rob
her
of
her
private
belongings
two
exclamations
of
denial
of
dismay
and
reproach
sounded
in
his
ears
innocent
and
guilty
alike
regarded
him
with
indignant
eyes
to
the
mysterious
feminine
reasoning
it
appeared
there
were
different
degrees
in
the
crime
of
theft
to
pay
a
debt
by
means
of
a
worthless
cheque
was
evidently
less
reprehensible
than
to
pilfer
a
brooch
from
a
guest
knew
himself
condemned
before
he
heard
the
simultaneous
replies
captain
guest
how
you
she
would
never
do
that
indeed
you
are
mistaken
i
bad
enough
but
i
have
not
fallen
quite
so
low
i
have
not
touched
a
thing
you
must
excuse
my
denseness
i
fail
to
see
how
one
theft
is
so
much
worse
than
the
other
i
am
sorry
to
seem
intrusive
miss
briskett
but
i
have
taken
a
certain
responsibility
upon
myself
and
i
must
be
satisfied
on
this
point
before
we
go
any
further
will
you
take
mrs
schuter
with
you
to
your
room
while
you
carefully
check
your
possessions
and
get
back
your
i
will
wait
here
till
you
return
for
a
moment
cornelia
appeared
on
the
point
of
refusing
but
she
changed
her
mind
and
without
a
word
led
the
way
down
the
corridor
towards
her
own
bedroom
her
stood
on
a
table
by
the
window
she
stood
over
it
uncertainly
as
if
still
debating
with
herself
whether
she
should
or
should
not
obey
guest
command
and
as
she
did
so
mrs
moffatt
voice
broke
the
silence
cornelia
there
not
a
mite
of
reason
why
you
should
take
my
word
but
i
tell
you
straight
i
have
laid
a
finger
on
one
of
your
things
you
ken
look
as
well
as
not
but
it
wasting
time
the
thirty
pounds
is
in
my
purse
ready
for
you
to
take
when
it
comes
to
the
last
silas
takes
fright
there
no
need
to
tell
any
more
lies
we
have
lived
by
this
sort
of
thing
for
years
past
but
as
soon
as
he
scents
danger
in
the
air
he
makes
off
to
a
place
of
safety
and
leaves
me
to
finish
up
you
wo
find
him
however
hard
you
search
but
i
right
here
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
cornelia
cornelia
drew
a
sharp
sobbing
breath
oh
why
did
you
do
it
she
cried
wildly
why
did
you
do
it
you
laid
a
plot
for
me
from
the
start
i
was
rich
and
and
so
you
fussed
over
me
and
acted
like
a
friend
and
invited
me
up
here
for
nothing
but
to
bleed
me
to
get
as
much
out
of
me
as
you
could
and
then
leave
me
to
face
it
out
alone
in
a
strange
place
i
was
your
own
countrywoman
and
i
trusted
you
had
you
got
a
spark
of
loyalty
left
that
you
could
act
so
mrs
moffatt
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
her
voice
seemed
paralysed
husky
disjointed
and
feeble
no
it
all
gone
loyalty
faith
everything
that
matters
nothing
left
but
you
not
believe
me
if
i
said
i
was
fond
of
you
cornelia
but
it
the
solid
truth
though
i
robbed
you
all
the
same
i
to
rob
you
as
you
say
you
had
plenty
of
money
and
we
were
cleaned
out
i
meant
to
get
away
with
that
necklace
and
sell
the
stones
on
the
continent
there
are
people
there
who
will
buy
without
asking
questions
i
got
to
know
them
pretty
well
during
the
last
few
years
cornelia
what
are
you
going
to
do
is
mr
marchant
sending
to
arrest
me
here
he
does
know
that
anything
is
wrong
i
managed
to
keep
quiet
and
let
him
believe
i
knew
all
about
it
to
the
last
i
kept
hoping
that
there
was
some
way
out
captain
guest
wanted
to
bring
an
officer
along
but
i
would
do
it
that
was
like
you
you
wanted
i
should
have
a
chance
but
it
all
true
every
one
thing
there
more
true
than
you
know
of
other
bills
to
come
in
a
big
sum
run
up
here
you
can
give
back
the
necklace
but
even
so
it
is
going
to
be
heavy
enough
cornelia
are
you
going
to
i
a
bad
woman
are
you
going
to
send
me
to
prison
to
have
a
chance
of
growing
worse
among
other
bad
women
like
myself
cornelia
threw
out
her
arms
with
a
sudden
reckless
gesture
she
cried
strongly
i
not
i
going
to
let
you
go
going
to
you
to
go
captain
guest
a
pretty
hard
man
i
guess
you
better
not
see
him
again
keep
those
notes
you
need
some
money
to
help
along
and
march
out
of
the
hotel
right
now
and
lose
yourself
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
you
can
have
ten
minutes
to
do
it
while
i
wait
here
and
as
much
longer
as
i
can
keep
him
quiet
but
you
got
to
be
slippy
you
shall
have
your
chance
mrs
moffatt
gasped
for
breath
her
face
twitched
convulsively
and
she
tottered
as
she
stood
you
mean
that
oh
god
bless
you
cornelia
briskett
if
there
are
any
blessings
going
there
no
one
on
earth
deserves
them
more
than
you
you
saved
me
this
time
whatever
happens
in
the
future
you
given
me
a
chance
that
so
but
the
question
is
you
going
to
take
see
here
let
strike
a
bargain
over
this
before
you
go
you
are
a
clever
woman
or
you
would
have
escaped
so
long
but
the
game
is
played
out
it
is
safe
to
go
on
when
any
moment
you
may
be
recognised
by
people
you
have
fooled
before
you
bound
to
make
a
fresh
start
why
you
try
being
straight
for
a
change
you
find
it
would
pay
better
in
the
end
you
got
to
think
when
you
leave
this
that
a
whim
is
all
there
is
between
you
and
a
prison
cell
that
ought
to
be
a
pretty
bracing
remembrance
i
should
say
start
away
with
the
money
you
have
in
hand
and
see
if
you
ke
make
some
more
for
yourself
there
another
thing
you
can
write
to
me
in
a
year
from
now
and
tell
me
where
you
are
and
what
you
have
been
about
i
ferret
into
every
single
thing
and
if
it
i
help
you
again
i
go
helping
you
you
need
never
say
after
this
that
you
cheat
because
you
obliged
live
straight
and
work
hard
and
i
see
to
it
that
you
do
want
you
got
your
chance
i
guess
you
better
scoot
mrs
moffatt
stood
before
her
trembling
and
abject
overcome
with
a
pitiful
emotion
i
going
could
you
could
you
kiss
me
cornelia
before
i
go
cornelia
drew
herself
up
proudly
no
i
guess
not
we
leave
that
over
for
another
time
some
day
perhaps
when
you
straight
you
best
not
waste
any
more
time
i
going
i
ca
thank
you
i
swear
to
you
no
do
swear
i
do
want
any
promises
promise
that
the
best
thing
cornelia
briskett
the
door
opened
and
shut
cornelia
listened
with
bated
breath
but
all
was
silent
from
the
corridor
without
she
leant
her
head
on
the
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
captain
guest
paced
up
and
down
the
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
casting
impatient
glances
at
the
clock
and
pausing
now
and
then
to
lift
the
emerald
necklace
from
the
table
and
examine
it
with
wondering
curiosity
it
was
a
pretty
enough
plaything
but
from
his
point
of
view
it
seemed
a
preposterous
waste
of
money
to
sink
a
cool
thousand
pounds
on
its
purchase
he
mentally
ran
over
the
various
necessary
repairs
on
his
own
property
which
could
be
completed
for
the
sum
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
expressively
still
women
liked
such
playthings
and
if
one
were
specially
interested
in
a
woman
a
woman
say
to
whom
emeralds
were
specially
becoming
there
would
be
a
certain
satisfaction
in
seeing
her
wearing
the
pretty
things
it
was
conceivable
that
the
pleasure
so
given
might
even
be
as
keen
as
that
derived
from
a
new
or
a
barn
a
vision
rose
before
him
a
vision
of
a
ruddy
head
and
snowy
shoulders
on
which
the
green
light
flashed
and
waned
he
saw
cornelia
as
she
had
appeared
sitting
in
the
front
row
of
the
stalls
at
the
theatre
and
mentally
clasped
the
necklace
round
her
throat
the
door
opened
he
thrust
the
vision
aside
and
wheeled
round
quickly
reassuming
his
sternest
expression
a
dejected
little
girl
stood
on
the
threshold
with
dishevelled
locks
and
eyes
and
as
he
stared
in
amazement
she
quietly
closed
the
door
and
collapsed
in
a
limp
little
heap
on
the
corner
of
the
sofa
i
come
back
where
mrs
moffatt
she
the
voice
broke
in
a
strangled
sob
gone
gone
away
ten
minutes
ago
she
ever
so
far
off
by
now
guest
stood
still
transfixed
with
anger
and
astonishment
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
escaped
before
your
eyes
what
happened
did
you
leave
her
alone
in
your
room
no
i
told
her
to
go
i
sent
her
away
it
was
my
suggestion
from
the
start
you
told
her
to
go
guest
face
was
a
study
of
outraged
wrath
after
all
she
has
done
after
the
deliberate
way
in
which
she
has
cheated
and
deceived
you
after
the
lies
she
has
told
after
her
thefts
hundreds
of
pounds
still
to
pay
up
after
intending
to
desert
you
in
this
hotel
you
mean
to
tell
me
seriously
that
you
her
away
the
tousled
head
nodded
dumbly
two
big
tears
trickled
down
the
reddened
cheeks
are
you
aware
that
you
have
compounded
a
felony
if
mr
marchant
heard
what
you
had
done
he
could
accuse
you
of
being
a
partner
in
the
crime
do
you
know
that
you
have
broken
the
law
of
the
country
and
that
i
could
give
you
in
charge
at
this
moment
if
i
wished
to
do
so
i
guess
that
are
you
going
to
do
it
that
ridiculous
you
know
it
is
but
then
you
another
cried
cornelia
laughing
through
her
tears
you
as
bad
as
i
am
so
you
ca
preach
she
gone
anyway
and
i
we
got
the
necklace
and
for
the
rest
i
just
have
to
pay
up
and
look
pleasant
poppar
says
you
got
to
pay
for
experience
in
this
world
i
tell
him
i
concluded
i
better
learn
it
pretty
thoroughly
once
i
started
he
wo
mind
your
father
must
be
a
wealthy
man
if
he
can
afford
to
lose
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
without
feeling
annoyed
cornelia
looked
at
him
quickly
and
replied
in
a
tone
of
studied
indifference
oh
he
flush
enough
at
the
moment
likely
enough
we
shall
be
paupers
next
year
do
be
angry
with
me
captain
guest
i
simply
to
give
her
a
chance
i
can
afford
to
pay
up
and
if
i
sent
her
to
prison
it
would
have
killed
the
last
little
mite
of
i
trusted
her
instead
and
i
believe
that
going
to
help
more
than
any
punishment
it
would
she
had
a
good
old
fright
and
maybe
this
will
be
the
in
her
life
guest
lips
curled
in
eloquent
disbelief
he
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
room
then
stationed
himself
once
more
in
front
of
the
sofa
did
you
look
over
your
things
to
see
that
they
were
all
right
no
she
said
she
had
touched
them
did
you
make
her
return
the
notes
no
i
i
guessed
she
need
them
herself
how
extremely
considerate
did
you
feel
it
necessary
to
offer
her
a
little
more
while
you
were
about
it
to
give
her
another
twenty
pounds
say
to
make
up
the
full
change
for
the
cheque
the
face
that
peered
up
at
him
was
at
once
so
abashed
so
discomfited
so
childlike
in
its
humility
that
his
anger
melted
before
it
and
gave
place
to
a
wave
of
tenderness
you
ridiculous
little
girl
who
would
have
believed
that
all
your
shrewd
commonsense
would
collapse
like
this
no
i
not
angry
i
sha
scold
any
more
the
thing
done
now
and
you
had
enough
worry
i
going
to
ring
the
bell
and
order
some
luncheon
we
will
have
it
here
together
and
comfort
ourselves
after
all
this
excitement
i
hungry
enough
whatever
you
are
what
shall
it
be
you
are
going
to
treat
me
you
know
so
it
must
be
something
good
roast
chicken
that
what
ladies
generally
prefer
and
some
sweets
and
fruit
claret
for
me
and
what
for
you
is
it
to
be
once
more
he
went
to
the
door
to
give
the
order
to
the
waiter
accompanied
by
a
tip
which
had
the
effect
of
producing
the
meal
in
an
extraordinarily
short
space
of
time
cornelia
appearance
being
still
distinctly
dishevelled
guest
dismissed
the
waiter
and
himself
took
the
head
of
the
table
carving
the
chicken
handing
the
vegetable
dishes
and
even
pouring
out
the
coffee
if
they
had
been
a
honeymoon
couple
the
intimacy
of
the
scene
could
not
have
been
greater
but
in
that
case
he
would
have
taken
his
wife
in
his
arms
and
kissed
away
her
tears
poor
little
girl
there
was
precious
little
beauty
about
her
at
the
moment
yet
she
had
never
appeared
more
attractive
i
ke
eat
a
bite
was
cornelia
first
melancholy
statement
but
when
one
wing
of
the
chicken
had
disappeared
from
her
plate
mighty
good
she
said
and
promptly
set
to
work
on
a
second
she
drank
copious
draughts
of
coffee
began
to
revive
in
spirits
and
experience
qualms
concerning
her
appearance
say
do
i
look
a
perfect
freak
you
look
much
better
than
you
did
ten
minutes
since
in
another
ten
minutes
you
will
look
quite
like
yourself
if
you
obey
my
orders
and
eat
a
good
meal
cornelia
shrugged
expressively
i
know
what
that
means
i
guess
i
ugly
enough
to
kill
that
why
i
hate
to
cry
it
musses
one
up
so
for
hours
after
captain
guest
what
am
i
going
to
do
next
can
i
settle
up
and
get
away
to
norton
this
afternoon
do
you
suppose
i
am
afraid
not
the
last
train
leaves
at
three
and
that
does
not
give
enough
time
for
all
that
has
to
be
done
i
was
wondering
whether
my
aunt
whether
you
would
consent
to
sleep
at
her
house
night
suttenly
not
why
should
i
it
wo
be
the
first
time
by
a
good
many
that
i
stayed
a
night
by
myself
in
a
hotel
and
there
no
reason
why
i
should
move
i
have
my
meals
up
in
this
room
if
it
will
ease
you
any
but
i
wo
leave
this
place
till
morning
then
i
go
back
she
laughed
feebly
to
the
nook
and
humble
pie
you
need
not
tell
your
aunt
what
has
happened
if
you
do
choose
to
do
so
oh
yes
i
own
up
aunt
soph
will
be
pleased
to
feel
she
was
right
maybe
she
like
me
better
when
i
down
on
my
luck
what
must
i
set
about
first
i
shall
interview
the
hotel
manager
and
tell
him
the
whole
story
that
due
to
him
you
know
or
there
might
be
a
repetition
of
the
offence
then
there
the
jeweller
he
must
be
warned
in
the
same
way
and
the
necklace
returned
i
presume
you
do
want
to
keep
it
cornelia
shuddered
oh
no
i
could
never
wear
it
but
when
poppar
comes
over
i
make
him
buy
me
something
else
instead
mr
marchant
sha
lose
i
guess
i
better
drive
there
straight
away
and
then
to
the
bank
i
have
to
arrange
for
a
pretty
big
draft
you
never
know
how
things
are
going
to
pan
out
in
this
world
do
you
i
thought
i
was
going
to
spend
this
afternoon
on
the
river
gliding
about
so
sweet
and
peaceful
guest
flushed
hesitated
and
plunged
why
should
we
go
all
the
same
we
can
finish
our
business
and
still
have
time
if
you
will
allow
me
i
take
great
care
of
you
and
bring
you
home
before
it
dark
it
would
be
too
dreary
sitting
up
here
by
yourself
all
the
evening
cornelia
sprang
to
her
feet
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
how
lovely
how
lovely
you
just
the
nicest
thing
it
sweet
of
you
to
think
of
it
go
right
away
now
and
get
through
with
your
interview
and
i
join
you
in
the
lounge
as
soon
as
i
prinked
and
gotten
my
face
into
order
i
hang
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
massage
my
nose
let
go
and
be
happy
and
forget
all
our
woes
she
ran
to
the
door
waved
her
hand
gaily
over
her
shoulder
and
disappeared
from
sight
chapter
twenty
two
when
guest
drove
round
to
the
hotel
next
morning
to
escort
cornelia
to
the
station
she
was
surprised
to
see
his
own
bag
on
the
roof
and
to
hear
that
he
intended
to
accompany
her
all
the
way
to
norton
i
want
to
make
sure
that
you
are
safely
housed
once
more
he
explained
as
they
drove
off
i
feel
a
certain
responsibility
for
you
and
i
think
perhaps
your
aunt
would
like
to
see
me
and
hear
from
a
second
person
that
everything
is
satisfactorily
settled
here
my
aunt
said
cornelia
demurely
my
aunt
is
a
mite
disposed
to
acknowledge
your
responsibility
she
thinks
you
she
do
approve
of
dashing
young
men
she
warned
me
specially
to
avoid
you
humph
dashing
am
i
the
word
has
an
early
victorian
sound
that
suggests
and
trousers
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
flattered
returned
guest
as
he
alternately
stared
out
of
the
window
and
busied
himself
in
arranging
the
bags
on
the
front
seat
of
the
cab
there
was
an
air
of
embarrassment
in
his
manner
this
morning
and
he
talked
against
time
as
if
anxious
not
to
let
the
conversation
come
to
a
pause
the
afternoon
on
the
river
had
been
a
delightful
experience
abundantly
proving
the
truth
of
his
prophecy
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
bored
in
cornelia
society
she
had
looked
very
sweet
in
her
softened
mood
and
as
they
drifted
down
the
stream
together
had
prattled
away
in
simple
confiding
fashion
telling
him
the
story
of
her
life
of
the
ups
and
downs
which
she
and
her
poppar
had
known
together
of
her
own
individual
adventures
he
learnt
that
she
was
not
engaged
and
had
never
been
in
love
though
there
were
always
heaps
of
admirers
prancing
round
she
intended
to
marry
some
day
however
why
suttenly
just
as
soon
as
ever
the
right
man
hove
along
what
was
the
good
of
being
a
woman
if
you
did
have
your
own
home
and
your
own
husband
and
children
then
she
looked
at
him
with
her
clear
golden
eyes
and
inquired
how
it
was
with
himself
was
he
in
love
no
answered
guest
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
he
lied
in
the
guise
of
a
yankee
stranger
who
embodied
in
herself
all
the
traits
which
he
most
condemned
the
one
woman
of
his
life
had
appeared
he
loved
and
the
woman
whom
he
loved
was
cornelia
briskett
after
that
conversation
languished
guest
was
too
much
bewildered
by
the
sudden
realisation
of
his
position
to
wish
to
talk
and
cornelia
had
developed
a
headache
as
a
result
of
the
morning
emotion
she
was
glad
to
be
quiet
to
allow
herself
to
be
led
about
and
cared
for
and
told
what
she
must
do
just
like
a
young
girl
she
said
laughingly
as
they
parted
in
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
if
i
lived
over
here
long
enough
there
no
telling
i
might
grow
into
a
moss
rose
myself
i
wish
you
would
i
wish
you
would
wo
you
try
guest
cried
eagerly
he
himself
did
not
know
what
he
really
meant
by
the
inquiry
for
the
words
had
sprung
to
his
lips
almost
without
thought
he
was
as
much
startled
by
the
sound
of
them
as
was
cornelia
herself
he
saw
the
dismay
in
her
eyes
the
dawning
comprehension
he
saw
something
else
also
the
first
flicker
of
the
first
droop
of
the
lids
she
put
him
off
with
a
light
answer
and
he
went
out
to
pace
the
streets
until
the
night
closed
around
him
what
was
this
that
had
happened
and
what
was
it
going
to
mean
one
week
a
week
to
the
day
since
he
had
first
met
this
girl
and
conceived
a
violent
dislike
to
her
on
the
spot
voice
accent
and
manner
had
alike
jarred
on
his
nerves
she
had
appeared
in
every
respect
the
opposite
to
the
decorous
if
somewhat
inane
damsel
who
represented
his
ideal
of
feminine
charm
one
week
ago
what
magic
did
she
possess
this
little
girl
to
make
such
short
work
of
the
scruples
of
a
lifetime
what
was
this
mysterious
feminine
charm
which
blinded
his
senses
to
everything
but
just
herself
and
the
dearness
of
her
and
the
longing
to
have
her
for
his
own
the
jarring
element
had
not
disappeared
the
difference
of
thought
still
existed
but
for
the
moment
he
was
oblivious
of
their
existence
for
the
first
time
in
his
years
he
was
in
love
and
had
room
for
no
other
thought
the
morning
brought
colder
reflections
when
supposing
he
ever
married
it
would
be
wormwood
and
gall
to
see
his
wife
condemned
by
his
friends
he
had
looked
forward
to
espousing
the
daughter
of
some
irreproachable
county
family
and
returning
to
his
old
home
to
live
in
frugal
state
for
the
rest
of
his
life
driving
to
church
in
the
old
barouche
attending
a
succession
of
dull
dinners
taking
the
chair
at
village
meetings
he
tried
to
imagine
cornelia
spending
long
peaceful
years
as
the
squire
wife
contentedly
pottering
about
the
village
superintending
dorcas
meetings
and
finding
recreation
in
occasional
garden
parties
where
the
same
people
met
the
same
people
attired
in
the
same
frocks
and
sat
meekly
in
rows
drinking
claret
cup
and
sour
lemonade
but
the
effort
failed
cornelia
obstinately
refused
to
fit
into
the
niche
he
could
summon
up
a
vision
of
her
indeed
but
it
was
a
disconcerting
vision
in
which
she
pranced
round
while
the
neighbourhood
turned
its
back
and
pursed
disapproving
lips
he
was
attracted
by
the
girl
seriously
attracted
it
was
a
great
big
and
he
promised
himself
to
be
cautious
to
think
long
and
well
before
taking
the
plunge
all
the
same
it
seemed
imperative
that
he
should
return
to
norton
his
aunt
was
always
delighted
to
put
him
up
and
he
could
not
be
happy
until
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
all
was
well
with
cornelia
once
more
incidentally
also
he
was
interested
to
know
what
was
happening
at
the
manor
on
the
journey
to
norton
the
presence
of
kept
the
conversation
necessarily
impersonal
and
at
the
station
cornelia
dismissed
her
escort
refusing
point
blank
to
drive
with
him
to
the
park
i
going
back
as
a
sorrowing
penitent
and
it
do
suit
the
part
to
drive
up
with
a
dashing
young
man
there
are
only
two
players
in
this
act
and
they
are
aunt
soph
and
myself
you
come
round
in
the
evening
when
i
paved
the
way
till
then
said
guest
raising
his
hat
once
again
as
he
looked
at
her
through
the
window
of
the
cab
the
clear
eyes
wavered
before
his
own
once
again
his
scruples
vanished
he
loved
and
the
world
held
nothing
but
that
glad
fact
cornelia
exhibited
much
diplomacy
in
her
interview
with
her
aunt
seated
at
the
good
lady
feet
in
an
attitude
of
childlike
humility
she
related
the
story
of
her
adventures
in
simple
unexaggerated
language
without
any
attempt
at
i
ought
to
have
guessed
from
the
start
but
it
seems
i
not
as
smart
as
i
thought
they
had
me
the
whole
way
through
you
were
right
you
see
and
i
was
wrong
i
should
have
taken
your
advice
guess
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
me
i
trust
it
may
prove
so
my
dear
a
but
invaluable
lesson
quoth
miss
briskett
blandly
so
far
from
being
incensed
she
actually
purred
with
satisfaction
for
had
not
the
truant
returned
home
in
a
humble
and
tractable
spirit
ready
to
acknowledge
and
apologise
for
her
error
her
good
humour
was
such
that
she
bore
the
shock
of
hearing
of
guest
role
in
the
drama
with
comparative
composure
he
seems
she
declared
to
have
comported
himself
with
considerable
judgment
but
my
dear
cornelia
if
anything
more
were
needed
to
demonstrate
the
necessity
for
caution
and
restraint
in
the
future
it
must
surely
be
the
remembrance
that
you
were
driven
into
such
intimate
relationship
with
a
man
whose
acquaintance
you
had
made
but
a
few
short
days
before
it
seems
to
me
that
the
recollection
must
be
painfully
embarrassing
to
any
nice
young
girl
yes
said
cornelia
meekly
she
lowered
her
eyelids
and
her
cheeks
flushed
to
a
vivid
pink
such
a
typical
picture
did
she
make
of
a
modest
and
abashed
young
girl
that
the
spinster
stern
face
relaxed
into
a
smile
and
she
laid
her
hand
affectionately
upon
the
ruddy
locks
there
there
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
is
to
leave
the
sins
we
loved
before
and
show
that
we
in
earnest
grieve
by
doing
so
another
time
you
will
be
guided
by
wiser
counsels
have
you
missed
me
aunt
soph
while
i
been
away
er
the
house
has
seemed
very
quiet
replied
miss
briskett
truthfully
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
obliged
to
leave
you
this
afternoon
my
dear
but
i
have
promised
to
attend
a
committee
meeting
at
four
you
will
be
glad
to
rest
after
your
journey
and
to
unpack
and
get
your
things
put
neatly
away
has
elma
come
home
she
returned
yesterday
morning
i
saw
the
from
the
manor
waiting
outside
the
gate
this
morning
mrs
ramsden
told
me
the
other
day
that
elma
health
was
completely
restored
cornelia
pondered
over
these
scanty
items
of
news
as
she
sat
at
her
solitary
tea
an
hour
later
elma
was
well
elma
had
returned
home
a
from
the
manor
had
been
observed
waiting
outside
the
gate
of
the
holt
that
morning
a
imagination
failed
to
picture
the
picturesque
figure
of
madame
perched
on
the
high
seat
of
that
undignified
vehicle
if
the
cart
had
not
conveyed
the
mother
it
must
in
all
probability
have
conveyed
the
son
the
had
been
the
deduction
was
obvious
to
the
meanest
intellect
geoffrey
greville
had
driven
down
to
see
elma
the
morning
after
her
departure
and
had
spent
a
considerable
time
in
her
society
suddenly
cornelia
realised
that
her
anxiety
could
brook
no
delay
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
spend
another
night
without
discovering
how
the
moss
rose
had
fared
during
her
absence
she
despatched
mary
to
the
holt
with
a
verbal
message
to
the
effect
that
she
had
returned
from
town
and
if
convenient
would
much
like
to
see
miss
ramsden
for
a
few
minutes
before
six
and
while
she
was
still
at
tea
the
answer
was
received
a
note
this
time
written
in
pencil
and
bearing
marks
of
haste
and
agitation
dearest
cornelia
yes
of
course
i
thankful
you
are
back
come
right
up
to
my
room
it
perfectly
wretched
here
but
i
so
happy
elma
cornelia
rolled
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
indulged
in
an
expressive
whistle
contradictory
as
elma
epistle
might
have
appeared
to
an
ordinary
reader
she
understood
it
readily
enough
it
was
mrs
ramsden
who
was
wretched
elma
who
was
happy
happy
despite
the
atmosphere
of
disapproval
the
crisis
had
arrived
in
five
minutes
time
cornelia
was
in
her
friend
room
holding
her
hands
gazing
into
her
face
kissing
her
flaming
cheeks
elma
it
it
is
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
oh
you
dear
thing
when
how
i
crazy
to
know
tell
me
every
single
thing
elma
laughed
a
delicious
little
laugh
of
conscious
happiness
yes
yes
it
is
oh
cornelia
is
it
wonderful
i
ca
believe
it
it
partly
your
doing
you
know
and
i
love
you
for
that
but
does
it
seem
impossible
that
he
can
really
care
for
she
turned
her
exquisite
face
towards
her
friend
with
an
expression
of
humility
as
sweet
as
it
was
sincere
he
might
have
had
anybody
and
he
chooses
oh
cornelia
i
never
knew
that
one
could
live
and
be
so
happy
it
seems
like
a
dream
wake
up
then
and
get
down
to
facts
i
crazy
to
hear
all
about
it
when
was
it
settled
this
morning
only
this
morning
i
calculated
it
would
come
off
monday
at
latest
no
it
did
of
course
he
was
very
i
mean
i
knew
we
both
understood
but
geoffrey
says
he
could
possibly
have
spoken
plainly
while
i
was
a
guest
under
his
own
roof
it
would
have
been
the
right
thing
he
was
obliged
to
wait
till
i
got
home
my
how
mediaeval
i
should
have
thought
geoffrey
greville
had
more
snap
to
him
than
to
hang
on
to
such
notions
fancy
letting
you
go
away
and
driving
down
in
cold
blood
next
morning
it
the
dullest
thing
it
not
dull
at
all
contradicted
elma
hotly
it
noble
and
manly
and
i
love
him
for
it
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honour
more
shucks
sniffed
cornelia
scornfully
i
as
lief
have
a
little
less
and
a
lot
more
push
i
would
mind
if
it
was
his
house
ten
times
over
i
want
him
to
feel
he
could
wait
another
five
minutes
and
settle
it
off
so
we
could
have
a
good
time
together
if
he
let
me
come
away
not
knowing
if
he
were
in
fun
or
earnest
i
have
led
him
a
pretty
dance
for
his
pains
but
you
so
meek
i
bet
you
dropped
into
his
mouth
like
a
ripe
plum
elma
drew
herself
up
with
a
charming
dignity
i
told
him
the
truth
without
any
pretences
if
that
is
what
you
mean
she
said
quietly
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
with
geoffrey
behaviour
and
i
rather
not
discuss
it
cornelia
please
we
may
seem
fashioned
to
you
but
we
understand
each
other
and
there
is
not
a
thing
not
a
single
thing
i
would
wish
altered
i
am
perfectly
utterly
happy
bless
you
you
sweet
thing
i
see
you
are
and
i
happy
for
you
never
mind
how
it
happened
it
happened
and
that
good
enough
how
mrs
ramsden
bearing
up
elma
face
fell
for
a
person
who
had
just
proclaimed
herself
completely
happy
she
looked
astonishingly
worried
and
perturbed
oh
my
dear
such
a
scene
i
took
geoffrey
in
to
see
her
and
she
could
have
been
more
horrified
if
he
had
been
the
most
desperate
character
in
the
world
she
refused
to
listen
to
a
word
you
would
not
have
recognised
mother
she
was
so
haughty
and
distant
and
rude
some
things
she
said
were
horribly
rude
after
he
went
she
cried
that
was
the
worst
of
all
she
cried
and
said
she
had
given
her
whole
life
for
me
for
years
and
was
i
going
to
break
her
heart
as
a
reward
i
cried
too
and
said
no
i
should
love
her
more
not
less
but
she
would
listen
she
said
if
i
married
geoffrey
it
would
be
as
bad
as
a
public
refutation
of
all
the
principles
which
i
had
professed
since
childhood
then
she
called
him
names
and
i
got
angry
we
speak
a
word
all
through
lunch
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
she
sent
for
a
fly
to
drive
to
the
manor
she
there
still
shut
up
with
madame
hatching
the
plan
of
campaign
madame
wo
like
it
any
better
i
suppose
elma
flushed
miserably
no
she
against
us
too
geoffrey
told
her
what
he
was
coming
for
and
is
it
curious
she
was
quite
surprised
she
had
not
suspected
a
bit
and
i
afraid
she
was
pretty
cross
geoffrey
would
let
me
say
it
but
i
know
she
does
think
me
good
enough
i
not
quite
true
no
one
knows
it
better
than
i
if
you
say
that
again
i
shake
you
you
a
heap
too
good
for
the
best
man
that
ever
lived
mind
now
elma
do
start
out
on
this
business
by
eating
humble
pie
you
got
to
hold
up
your
end
of
the
stick
for
all
you
worth
and
let
them
see
you
wo
be
sat
upon
when
you
feel
redooced
go
and
sit
in
front
of
the
glass
for
a
spell
and
ask
yourself
if
he
wo
be
a
lucky
man
to
have
that
vista
across
the
table
all
the
rest
of
his
life
do
be
humble
with
whatever
happens
make
him
believe
he
got
the
pick
of
the
bundle
he
he
does
said
elma
and
blushed
again
it
makes
me
ashamed
to
hear
him
talk
about
me
for
i
know
i
am
really
so
different
he
would
not
have
thought
me
so
sweet
if
he
had
heard
me
scolding
mother
this
morning
poor
mother
i
so
terribly
sorry
for
her
it
must
be
hard
to
care
for
a
child
for
years
as
she
says
and
then
have
to
step
aside
for
a
stranger
i
sympathised
with
every
word
she
said
and
knew
that
i
should
have
felt
the
same
my
head
was
with
her
all
the
time
but
my
heart
she
clasped
her
hands
to
her
side
with
the
prettiest
of
gestures
my
heart
was
with
geoffrey
reason
not
a
bit
of
use
cornelia
when
you
in
love
well
said
cornelia
firmly
my
heart
got
to
wait
and
behave
itself
until
my
head
goes
along
at
the
same
pace
i
not
kept
it
in
order
for
years
to
have
it
weaken
at
the
last
moment
stick
to
my
guns
whatever
it
may
cost
elma
looked
at
her
with
surprised
curiosity
why
you
talk
as
if
as
if
you
were
in
love
too
i
wish
you
we
could
sympathise
with
each
other
so
beautifully
you
in
love
cornelia
you
never
said
so
before
cornelia
turned
to
the
window
and
gazed
out
on
the
forbidden
grass
of
the
park
her
face
was
hidden
from
view
and
she
answered
by
another
question
put
in
slow
thoughtful
what
is
love
you
seem
to
feel
pretty
certain
that
yours
is
the
genuine
article
define
it
for
me
how
do
you
feel
when
you
are
in
dear
geoffrey
society
happy
so
wonderfully
happy
that
i
seem
to
walk
on
air
everything
seems
beautiful
and
i
love
everybody
and
long
to
make
them
as
happy
as
myself
nothing
troubles
me
any
more
it
seems
as
if
nothing
could
trouble
me
geoffrey
there
he
is
like
a
great
big
rock
which
will
shelter
me
all
my
life
do
you
feel
one
moment
that
it
the
cutest
thing
in
the
world
to
sit
right
there
in
the
shade
and
be
fussed
over
and
the
next
as
if
you
wanted
to
knock
the
rock
down
and
march
away
down
your
own
road
do
you
feel
blissful
one
moment
and
the
next
all
worked
up
and
fit
to
scratch
when
he
kinder
big
and
superior
and
the
natural
protector
do
you
feel
ugly
or
inclined
to
cave
in
and
honour
and
obey
elma
stared
at
her
with
shocked
blue
eyes
of
i
obey
geoffrey
is
so
wise
and
clever
he
knows
so
much
better
than
i
only
too
thankful
to
let
him
decide
for
us
both
you
talk
so
strangely
cornelia
i
do
understand
cornelia
swung
round
quickly
and
kissed
her
upon
the
cheek
never
mind
sweetling
she
said
fondly
do
to
understand
you
are
better
off
as
you
are
it
is
women
like
you
who
have
the
best
time
in
the
world
and
are
the
most
loved
i
wish
i
were
like
you
but
i
not
so
what
the
use
of
repining
i
am
as
i
wor
created
she
laughed
but
the
laugh
had
a
forced
unnatural
sound
elma
saw
with
dismay
a
glimmer
of
tears
in
the
golden
eyes
chapter
twenty
three
for
a
whole
week
the
battle
raged
the
battle
between
youth
and
age
love
and
the
world
elma
pleaded
for
patience
and
geoffrey
urged
defiance
and
independence
mrs
ramsden
quoted
scripture
and
made
constant
reference
to
serpents
teeth
while
madame
remained
charmingly
satirical
refusing
to
treat
the
matter
otherwise
than
as
a
joke
laughing
at
geoffrey
rhapsodies
and
assuring
him
that
he
was
suffering
from
an
attack
of
sun
from
which
recovery
would
be
swift
and
certain
rupert
guest
and
cornelia
hurried
to
and
fro
on
the
outskirts
of
the
fray
in
the
character
of
carrying
messages
and
administering
encouragement
and
consolation
every
morning
cornelia
sat
in
conclave
with
her
friend
in
the
prosaic
victorian
which
took
the
place
of
the
turret
chamber
of
romance
elma
would
not
condescend
to
hold
stolen
interviews
with
her
lover
while
both
families
so
strongly
opposed
the
engagement
so
she
shut
herself
up
in
the
house
growing
daily
whiter
and
thinner
wandering
aimlessly
from
room
to
room
and
crying
helplessly
upon
her
bed
it
was
as
a
breath
of
fresh
mountain
air
when
cornelia
appeared
upon
the
scene
bearing
always
the
same
terse
practical
advice
make
sure
of
your
own
mind
and
to
it
the
colour
came
back
to
elma
face
as
she
listened
and
hope
revived
in
her
heart
she
declared
anew
that
nothing
in
the
world
should
separate
her
from
geoffrey
that
she
would
be
true
to
him
to
the
last
day
of
her
life
cornelia
repeated
these
touching
vows
in
conclave
with
guest
behind
the
shrubbery
of
the
park
and
then
he
went
off
to
the
manor
to
cheer
geoffrey
with
the
news
of
the
steadfast
loyalty
of
his
assurances
soon
pall
however
on
the
youthful
lover
and
after
a
week
had
passed
by
geoffrey
suddenly
waxed
desperate
and
announced
that
he
would
not
submit
to
the
separation
for
another
hour
he
was
perfectly
capable
of
choosing
his
own
wife
elma
was
of
age
and
at
liberty
to
decide
for
herself
he
would
go
down
to
the
holt
that
very
afternoon
and
have
it
out
with
the
old
lady
once
for
all
if
his
mother
liked
to
accompany
him
so
much
the
better
she
and
mrs
ramsden
could
each
have
their
say
and
then
he
and
elma
would
have
theirs
for
his
part
he
warned
them
that
no
arguments
could
move
him
from
his
point
but
they
might
see
what
they
would
do
with
elma
perhaps
they
could
persuade
elma
to
give
him
up
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
in
proud
fashion
but
madame
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
smoothed
the
ruffles
on
her
sleeves
and
replied
in
her
sweetest
tones
dear
boy
yes
quite
a
good
idea
let
us
talk
it
over
like
sensible
people
elma
has
such
truly
nice
i
feel
sure
we
may
trust
her
decision
geoffrey
sat
him
down
forthwith
to
indite
a
letter
to
his
love
warning
her
of
the
ordeal
ahead
in
a
couple
of
lines
and
enlarging
on
his
own
devotion
for
the
rest
of
the
sheet
which
missive
was
entrusted
to
guest
when
he
paid
his
daily
visit
to
the
manor
i
mean
to
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense
once
for
all
the
squire
declared
firmly
you
must
be
sick
of
trotting
to
and
fro
with
these
everlasting
messages
but
there
wo
be
any
more
need
for
them
after
guest
expressed
his
gratification
and
started
forth
on
his
return
journey
profoundly
depressed
in
spirit
with
the
end
of
the
strife
would
end
his
daily
meetings
with
cornelia
which
alone
kept
him
in
norton
miss
briskett
attitude
on
the
occasion
of
his
one
call
at
the
nook
had
not
encouraged
him
to
repeat
the
experiment
he
smiled
to
himself
whenever
he
recalled
the
picture
of
the
room
the
spinster
with
her
stiff
repellent
manner
and
the
slim
figure
of
cornelia
sitting
demurely
in
the
background
drooping
her
eyes
to
the
ground
whenever
her
aunt
looked
in
her
direction
and
wrinkling
her
nose
at
him
in
pert
little
grimaces
when
the
good
lady
back
was
turned
so
that
he
had
had
hard
work
to
preserve
his
gravity
since
that
evening
they
had
met
daily
in
the
shrubbery
of
the
park
though
only
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
for
cornelia
steadily
refused
to
sit
down
or
to
linger
by
his
side
in
a
manner
which
would
suggest
that
the
assignation
was
on
her
behalf
as
well
as
that
of
her
friend
guest
was
always
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
and
was
careful
to
remain
standing
in
a
position
from
which
he
could
watch
the
girl
approach
in
these
bright
summer
days
cornelia
was
invariably
dressed
in
white
her
short
skirts
standing
out
above
her
feet
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
herself
and
the
fashion
plates
she
wore
shady
hats
which
dipped
over
her
face
and
curved
upward
at
the
sides
showing
the
burnished
waves
of
her
wonderful
hair
at
first
sight
she
gave
the
impression
of
looking
pale
and
ill
but
invariably
by
the
time
she
reached
his
side
her
cheeks
were
pink
and
he
forgot
his
anxiety
in
delight
and
admiration
his
manner
was
less
buoyant
than
usual
as
he
delivered
the
note
into
her
hands
an
ultimatum
at
last
geoffrey
and
madame
propose
to
storm
the
citadel
this
afternoon
quite
time
too
i
wonder
he
has
waited
so
long
i
should
have
come
to
blows
on
the
second
day
fancy
hanging
about
a
whole
week
when
a
girl
like
that
was
waiting
to
see
you
cornelia
turned
the
letter
round
and
round
staring
at
it
the
while
with
absent
eyes
you
used
to
say
that
he
would
never
marry
her
that
she
was
not
a
suitable
wife
that
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
if
he
did
i
used
to
say
a
great
many
foolish
things
said
guest
quietly
i
did
know
what
i
was
talking
about
you
see
now
i
do
if
she
is
the
woman
he
loves
all
the
little
differences
go
for
nothing
i
hope
he
will
marry
her
and
i
believe
that
they
will
be
happy
cornelia
twirled
to
and
fro
on
the
heels
of
her
pointed
shoes
and
tilted
her
chin
with
a
pretence
at
indifference
well
i
guess
it
wo
help
things
on
if
i
hang
about
gossiping
here
she
ought
to
have
this
letter
at
once
to
think
out
what
she
going
to
say
poor
little
elma
she
have
a
rough
time
with
those
two
mammas
firing
away
at
her
at
the
same
time
mrs
ramsden
will
plump
for
principle
and
madame
for
convention
it
does
seem
to
either
of
that
love
is
enough
they
both
believe
they
know
a
heap
better
what
good
for
the
young
people
than
they
do
themselves
been
through
you
ca
get
away
from
that
they
been
through
it
and
away
at
the
other
end
they
are
going
to
do
all
they
know
to
prevent
their
own
son
and
their
own
daughter
from
the
folly
of
marrying
for
love
people
some
people
seem
to
keep
no
memory
of
youth
in
middle
age
it
a
pity
for
it
destroys
their
influence
in
the
end
however
it
is
the
young
people
who
decide
these
two
ought
to
know
their
own
minds
for
it
has
not
been
a
hurried
affair
they
have
known
each
other
for
years
and
have
been
more
and
more
attracted
that
is
a
duty
which
a
man
and
a
woman
owe
to
each
other
in
these
circumstances
to
make
sure
that
what
they
are
offering
is
real
and
lasting
i
suppose
only
time
can
prove
this
we
shall
see
what
this
afternoon
brings
forth
in
any
case
i
am
needed
no
i
thought
of
going
north
morning
to
pay
a
couple
of
visits
the
hand
that
was
playing
with
the
letter
was
still
for
a
moment
and
an
almost
imperceptible
quiver
straightened
the
white
figure
for
a
moment
guest
saw
or
imagined
that
he
saw
a
shadow
flit
across
the
face
but
it
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
she
tilted
her
head
and
said
calmly
i
guess
you
right
we
done
our
turn
and
now
they
got
to
fend
for
themselves
i
hope
you
have
a
real
good
time
mr
greville
will
let
you
know
when
the
wedding
fixed
oh
i
shall
be
back
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
weeks
before
any
talk
of
dates
i
expect
i
shall
see
you
again
in
july
he
paused
looking
at
her
with
sudden
uneasy
suspicion
you
will
be
here
in
july
there
is
no
chance
that
you
may
be
away
paying
other
visits
cornelia
shook
her
head
i
have
no
other
relations
over
here
so
far
as
i
know
at
present
i
shall
stay
on
here
until
poppar
comes
over
to
fetch
me
we
going
to
fly
round
together
for
two
or
three
months
after
that
guest
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
but
as
he
took
cornelia
outstretched
hand
in
his
own
to
say
he
added
a
hesitating
request
if
for
any
unexpected
reason
you
should
be
leaving
norton
during
the
next
three
or
four
weeks
will
you
let
me
know
a
line
to
my
club
will
always
be
forwarded
if
there
were
any
uncertainty
about
seeing
you
again
i
his
voice
lost
its
level
tone
and
became
husky
and
disconnected
these
visits
do
i
could
put
them
i
am
myself
go
because
his
fingers
tightened
over
hers
in
involuntary
appeal
cornelia
i
wonder
if
you
understand
what
is
in
my
mind
she
looked
into
his
kindled
face
with
serious
unwavering
eyes
for
a
moment
it
appeared
as
if
she
had
some
difficulty
in
managing
her
voice
but
when
she
spoke
it
was
calm
and
as
ever
i
understand
that
you
been
a
real
true
friend
to
me
captain
guest
and
i
grateful
for
all
the
good
times
we
had
together
all
we
need
worry
about
elma
is
waiting
i
must
keep
her
longer
again
i
wish
you
a
real
pleasant
time
she
drew
her
hand
from
his
gently
enough
yet
with
a
determination
which
could
not
be
opposed
in
her
voice
there
was
the
same
note
of
finality
the
composure
of
her
pale
fixed
look
checked
the
words
on
guest
lips
and
left
him
chilled
and
wondering
for
three
weeks
then
he
murmured
softly
but
no
echoing
assurance
came
in
reply
cornelia
carried
the
message
to
elma
in
her
den
cheered
her
with
affectionate
prophecies
and
hurried
back
to
the
shelter
of
her
own
bedroom
safe
behind
locked
doors
she
stood
before
the
mirror
on
her
staring
at
her
own
reflection
with
the
implacable
air
of
a
judge
regarding
a
prisoner
at
the
bar
the
slight
figure
was
held
proudly
erect
the
lips
set
in
a
straight
hard
line
but
the
eyes
poor
woman
eyes
the
eyes
wavered
and
on
the
white
cheeks
flamed
two
patches
of
rosy
red
cornelia
turned
on
her
heel
and
crossing
the
room
to
her
tore
open
a
letter
which
lay
there
already
addressed
to
her
father
in
america
it
was
a
long
epistle
containing
constant
references
to
his
coming
and
to
the
good
time
which
they
were
to
enjoy
together
with
deliberate
fingers
she
tore
it
in
pieces
and
dropped
the
fragments
into
the
basket
the
missive
which
was
written
in
its
stead
was
short
and
to
the
point
my
old
poppar
this
is
just
a
business
note
that
has
got
to
be
attended
to
in
a
hurry
do
what
they
told
and
ask
no
questions
there
are
breakers
ahead
over
here
they
concern
aunt
soph
i
broken
the
back
of
that
worry
and
we
get
along
a
treat
heart
trouble
daddy
symptoms
unfavourable
and
ultimate
collapse
preventable
only
by
speedy
change
of
scene
sit
down
straight
away
and
write
a
letter
i
can
show
round
summoning
me
home
by
the
first
boat
you
can
call
it
an
crisis
as
true
as
taxes
though
not
in
the
way
they
take
it
i
got
to
run
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
our
jaunt
must
wait
till
another
day
you
must
comfort
me
poppar
you
and
america
your
lonesome
cornelia
she
did
not
pause
to
read
over
what
she
had
written
but
fastening
it
in
an
envelope
pealed
the
bell
which
brought
mary
running
blithely
to
her
service
for
once
however
the
devoted
slave
ventured
to
raise
a
feeble
objection
miss
cornelia
i
in
the
middle
of
my
silver
it
will
go
just
as
soon
if
it
posted
by
three
cornelia
glanced
at
her
with
the
air
of
an
offended
goddess
i
said
now
and
i
now
this
instant
before
you
touch
another
one
thing
post
it
with
your
own
hands
and
come
up
here
to
tell
me
it
done
mary
vanished
in
a
whirl
of
starched
cotton
skirts
rushed
to
the
at
the
corner
of
the
park
and
in
five
minutes
time
was
back
at
the
bedroom
door
to
proclaim
her
obedience
cornelia
was
still
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
appeared
to
the
maid
that
she
had
not
altered
her
position
by
as
much
as
an
inch
since
she
had
seen
her
last
her
expression
was
tense
with
expectation
it
gone
miss
i
put
it
in
myself
the
golden
eyes
regarded
her
strangely
did
you
mury
said
cornelia
low
she
paused
a
moment
as
though
to
form
some
expression
of
acknowledgment
but
it
did
not
come
some
time
she
continued
slowly
some
time
mury
i
believe
i
going
to
thank
you
very
much
but
i
do
feel
like
gushing
you
can
go
back
to
your
work
chapter
twenty
four
i
suppose
i
must
give
them
tea
was
mrs
ramsden
comment
upon
hearing
of
the
visit
which
had
been
planned
for
the
afternoon
her
depression
was
broken
by
a
struggling
sense
of
elation
for
it
was
not
every
day
that
madame
deigned
to
accept
hospitality
from
her
neighbours
she
despatched
a
messenger
to
the
confectioner
to
purchase
a
pound
of
plum
cake
a
muffin
and
half
a
pound
of
macaroons
the
invariable
preparations
under
such
circumstances
and
gave
instructions
that
the
best
silver
and
china
should
be
brought
out
of
their
with
the
finest
tablecloth
and
at
three
elma
discovered
her
removing
the
covers
from
the
cushions
and
folding
them
neatly
away
in
the
chiffonnier
something
in
the
simple
action
touched
the
girl
and
broke
down
the
hard
wall
of
reserve
which
had
risen
between
her
mother
and
herself
during
the
past
painful
week
she
stretched
out
impulsive
arms
and
stooped
her
head
to
kiss
the
troubled
face
you
funny
little
mother
what
do
cushions
matter
geoffrey
will
never
notice
them
and
madame
she
hesitated
unwilling
to
hurt
her
feelings
by
hinting
at
madame
opinion
of
the
satin
splendours
so
carefully
preserved
from
sight
madame
wo
care
she
is
not
coming
to
admire
mrs
ramsden
lifted
a
flushed
face
to
look
at
her
daughter
standing
before
her
lovely
and
slender
in
the
blue
muslin
gown
which
had
been
cornelia
gift
the
daintiness
of
the
dress
its
unaccustomed
smartness
and
air
of
fashion
seemed
at
the
moment
a
presage
of
the
threatened
separation
at
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
the
softened
voice
the
tears
streamed
afresh
and
she
cried
brokenly
elma
elma
my
child
i
beg
you
at
the
eleventh
hour
think
consider
remember
all
that
i
have
striven
to
teach
you
you
have
prayed
to
resist
temptation
what
is
the
use
of
your
prayers
if
they
do
avail
you
in
your
hour
of
need
elma
i
know
it
will
be
hard
do
think
i
shall
not
suffer
with
you
but
if
it
is
right
there
is
no
happiness
my
child
if
we
depart
from
the
right
course
i
know
it
mother
said
elma
calmly
if
you
or
madame
can
convince
me
that
i
should
be
doing
wrong
in
marrying
geoffrey
i
will
give
him
up
i
promise
you
that
and
you
must
promise
me
in
return
that
you
will
try
to
see
things
from
our
point
of
view
as
well
as
your
own
remember
it
my
life
that
is
at
stake
and
i
so
young
i
may
have
such
a
long
time
to
live
some
girls
have
a
dozen
fancies
before
they
are
three
but
i
have
never
thought
of
anyone
else
from
the
first
time
that
i
met
geoffrey
i
knew
that
he
was
the
one
man
for
me
you
have
been
happily
married
yourself
mother
could
you
bear
to
spoil
our
happiness
mrs
ramsden
winced
at
the
sound
of
that
significant
little
pronoun
which
now
for
the
first
time
in
years
failed
to
include
herself
now
she
was
an
outsider
for
her
child
heart
and
life
alike
had
passed
from
her
keeping
it
is
a
bitter
moment
for
all
mothers
doubly
bitter
when
as
to
mrs
ramsden
the
supplanter
seems
unworthy
of
his
trust
happiness
is
not
everything
elma
i
hope
i
hope
i
am
strong
enough
to
endure
even
to
see
you
suffer
for
your
ultimate
good
she
mopped
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
while
elma
turned
aside
realising
sadly
that
it
was
useless
to
prolong
the
discussion
presently
geoffrey
and
his
mother
would
arrive
and
then
they
would
all
consult
together
elma
had
not
rehearsed
her
own
share
in
the
conversation
the
decision
was
in
the
last
issue
to
be
left
to
herself
and
she
had
spoken
the
simple
truth
in
saying
that
she
wished
above
all
things
to
do
what
was
right
her
life
training
had
instilled
the
conviction
that
no
happiness
was
possible
at
the
cost
of
a
sacrifice
of
principle
if
she
could
be
once
convinced
that
it
was
wrong
to
marry
geoffrey
greville
she
would
give
him
up
as
unflinchingly
as
any
martyr
of
old
walked
to
the
stake
but
she
must
be
convinced
on
the
ground
of
principle
alone
pride
prejudice
convention
would
pass
her
by
leaving
her
unshaken
in
her
determination
to
marry
the
man
she
loved
at
four
the
great
landau
from
the
manor
drove
up
to
the
gate
and
from
within
the
shrouded
windows
mother
and
daughter
watched
the
groom
jump
lightly
from
his
seat
to
shield
the
grey
froth
of
draperies
as
she
stepped
to
the
ground
to
mrs
ramsden
the
scene
was
an
eloquent
illustration
of
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
the
world
exemplified
by
the
carriage
with
its
handsome
trappings
its
valuable
horses
and
liveried
attendants
the
flesh
by
madame
a
picture
of
elegance
in
cloudy
grey
draperies
her
silvery
locks
surmounted
by
a
toque
her
cheeks
faintly
pink
beneath
the
old
lace
veil
the
devil
it
was
a
hard
word
to
apply
to
the
handsome
resolute
young
fellow
who
followed
his
mother
up
the
gravel
path
but
at
the
moment
geoffrey
greville
appeared
in
mrs
ramsden
eyes
as
the
destroyer
of
her
happiness
the
serpent
who
had
brought
discord
into
eden
she
was
in
truth
an
honest
little
puritan
in
whose
sight
the
good
things
of
the
world
were
but
as
snares
and
pitfalls
so
far
from
feeling
any
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
her
daughter
might
one
day
reign
as
the
great
lady
of
the
neighbourhood
the
prospect
filled
her
with
unaffected
dread
and
the
needle
eye
had
been
quoted
almost
as
frequently
as
the
serpent
teeth
during
the
last
week
she
turned
away
from
the
window
with
a
shudder
of
distress
the
door
opened
and
madame
entered
bringing
with
her
that
faint
delicious
fragrance
of
violets
which
seemed
inseparable
from
her
person
contrary
to
her
hostess
expectation
she
was
wreathed
in
smiles
and
even
more
gracious
than
of
yore
she
pressed
the
plump
little
hand
extended
towards
her
kissed
elma
on
the
cheek
exclaimed
prettily
upon
the
comfort
of
the
chair
to
which
she
was
escorted
and
chatted
about
the
weather
as
if
her
coming
were
an
ordinary
society
call
mrs
ramsden
being
unaccustomed
to
the
ways
of
fashionable
warfare
was
flurried
and
thrown
off
her
balance
by
so
unexpected
an
opening
to
the
fray
and
had
hard
work
to
answer
connectedly
she
was
moreover
keenly
on
the
alert
to
watch
the
meeting
between
elma
and
geoffrey
whom
she
had
not
seen
in
each
other
company
since
the
fatal
visit
to
the
manor
they
shook
hands
without
speaking
a
word
but
their
eyes
met
and
at
the
sight
of
that
look
the
onlooker
thrilled
with
a
memory
of
long
ago
that
glance
that
silent
softened
her
heart
more
than
a
hundred
arguments
it
was
an
ocular
demonstration
of
what
had
until
now
been
merely
words
the
trim
maid
brought
in
the
and
proceeded
to
set
it
out
on
the
little
table
in
front
of
her
mistress
it
was
a
good
hour
earlier
than
the
time
when
the
meal
was
served
at
the
manor
but
the
little
business
of
handing
round
cups
and
cake
broke
the
embarrassment
of
the
first
few
minutes
and
was
therefore
welcome
to
all
elma
began
as
usual
to
wait
upon
her
guests
but
geoffrey
took
the
plates
out
of
her
hand
with
an
air
of
gentle
authority
which
the
elder
ladies
were
quick
to
note
it
was
the
air
of
the
master
the
proprietor
as
significant
in
its
way
as
was
elma
blushing
obedience
once
again
mrs
ramsden
felt
a
pang
of
remembrance
but
madame
arched
her
eyebrows
and
tapped
her
foot
on
the
floor
in
noiseless
irritation
it
was
time
that
this
nonsense
came
to
an
end
well
dear
people
she
began
airily
let
us
get
to
business
it
so
much
wiser
to
talk
things
over
quietly
when
there
is
any
misunderstanding
i
thought
it
was
so
clever
of
geoffrey
to
suggest
this
meeting
letters
are
quite
useless
one
always
forgets
the
most
important
things
or
if
one
remembers
they
look
so
horribly
disagreeable
in
black
and
white
and
people
bring
them
up
against
one
years
afterwards
dear
elma
i
afraid
you
think
me
a
cruel
old
woman
i
am
desolated
to
appear
so
unfeeling
especially
as
i
should
certainly
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
in
geoffrey
place
but
it
not
always
a
question
of
doing
what
we
like
in
this
world
i
am
sure
your
dear
mother
has
taught
you
that
i
said
to
geoffrey
has
such
sweet
true
feelings
i
shall
be
quite
satisfied
to
trust
to
her
decision
when
the
matter
has
been
put
fully
before
her
thank
you
said
elma
faintly
she
had
put
down
her
cup
and
now
sat
with
her
fingers
clasped
tightly
together
on
her
lap
the
two
elder
ladies
faced
her
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
geoffrey
fidgeted
about
and
finally
seated
himself
not
by
her
side
as
had
obviously
been
his
first
impulse
but
some
little
distance
away
where
he
could
watch
the
expression
of
her
face
mrs
ramsden
pushed
the
aside
and
fidgeted
with
the
jet
trimming
on
her
cuff
i
er
i
think
we
should
get
on
better
if
mr
greville
would
would
kindly
leave
us
alone
she
said
awkwardly
we
are
well
acquainted
with
his
arguments
and
as
elma
is
to
decide
there
seems
no
object
in
his
staying
on
elma
will
no
doubt
feel
quieter
and
less
restrained
without
his
presence
madame
murmur
of
agreement
was
interrupted
by
a
sharp
exclamation
from
her
son
he
looked
flushed
and
angry
but
elma
checked
him
in
his
turn
and
answered
herself
in
clear
decided
accents
no
mother
i
shall
feel
much
better
if
geoffrey
is
here
i
do
want
him
to
go
if
i
am
persuaded
to
give
him
up
it
is
only
right
that
he
should
know
my
reasons
he
will
promise
to
listen
quietly
to
what
you
have
to
say
as
i
am
going
to
do
and
not
to
interrupt
until
you
have
done
she
turned
towards
her
lover
with
a
flickering
smile
wo
you
geoffrey
geoffrey
bit
his
moustache
and
scowled
heavily
i
do
my
best
he
said
slowly
i
not
going
away
in
any
case
it
preposterous
to
suppose
that
i
could
be
absent
while
such
a
discussion
was
going
on
elma
knows
that
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
me
if
you
persuade
her
to
give
me
up
it
will
be
sending
me
straight
to
the
devil
mrs
ramsden
eyes
flashed
with
anger
if
an
earthly
love
is
the
only
incentive
you
have
to
follow
the
paths
of
righteousness
mr
greville
that
is
a
poor
inducement
to
me
to
give
my
child
into
your
care
i
have
brought
her
up
to
put
principle
first
of
all
it
is
my
chief
objection
to
yourself
that
your
character
is
not
worthy
of
the
trust
my
dear
lady
he
is
not
a
pickpocket
you
speak
as
if
he
were
a
hardened
criminal
cried
madame
with
an
irritated
laugh
geoffrey
may
not
be
a
saint
but
i
assure
you
that
considered
as
a
young
man
of
the
world
he
is
quite
a
model
specimen
he
has
been
an
excellent
son
there
have
been
no
debts
no
troubles
of
any
kind
absolutely
at
times
i
have
accused
him
of
being
almost
too
staid
one
can
only
be
young
once
i
think
you
and
mrs
ramsden
have
somewhat
different
standards
mother
put
in
geoffrey
quietly
he
turned
towards
the
lady
bending
forward
and
speaking
with
deliberate
emphasis
i
quite
agree
with
you
mrs
ramsden
that
i
am
unworthy
of
your
daughter
i
wish
i
had
been
a
better
man
for
her
sake
with
her
to
help
me
i
hope
i
might
become
a
man
more
after
your
own
heart
as
my
mother
says
i
have
so
far
been
a
respectable
member
of
society
for
the
things
which
you
condemn
in
me
are
after
all
matters
of
opinion
but
at
this
moment
i
stand
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
if
you
give
me
elma
i
shall
look
upon
her
as
a
sacred
trust
and
shall
be
a
better
man
for
her
sake
i
be
a
better
man
with
her
beside
me
if
you
refuse
if
she
refuses
he
shrugged
expressively
you
empty
my
life
of
all
i
value
the
responsibility
will
be
upon
your
shoulders
that
is
not
true
you
can
depute
to
nobody
the
responsibility
of
your
own
soul
mrs
ramsden
began
solemnly
but
madame
interrupted
with
an
impatient
gesture
i
thought
geoffrey
was
not
to
interfere
for
pity
sake
do
let
us
waste
time
talking
sentiment
we
are
here
to
discuss
this
matter
in
a
sensible
business
manner
let
us
begin
at
once
and
not
waste
time
to
her
surprise
elma
met
her
glance
with
a
smile
a
happy
composed
little
smile
which
brought
the
dimples
into
her
soft
cheeks
really
the
child
was
wonderful
her
quietness
and
were
in
delightful
contrast
with
her
mother
flustered
solemnity
madame
returned
the
smile
with
restored
equanimity
and
felt
a
thrill
of
artistic
satisfaction
i
am
afraid
geoffrey
and
i
hardly
look
at
our
engagement
from
a
business
point
of
view
said
elma
slowly
it
a
matter
of
sentiment
with
us
and
we
are
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
it
but
i
must
answer
mother
first
mother
dear
you
are
shocked
because
geoffrey
says
he
would
not
be
good
without
me
but
when
were
young
when
you
were
careless
and
enjoyed
things
which
you
disapprove
of
now
was
there
no
good
influence
in
your
life
which
helped
you
to
be
strong
it
may
have
been
a
companion
or
a
book
or
a
sermon
one
of
a
hundred
things
but
when
it
came
were
you
thankful
for
it
did
you
hold
close
to
it
and
fear
lest
it
should
go
i
am
geoffrey
influence
i
glad
and
proud
that
it
is
so
if
i
can
help
him
in
one
little
way
i
rather
do
it
than
anything
else
in
all
the
world
when
he
feels
like
that
about
me
i
should
think
it
very
very
wrong
to
give
him
up
elma
my
dear
these
are
specious
arguments
you
are
deceiving
yourself
and
preparing
a
bitter
awakening
mr
greville
does
not
even
understand
what
he
is
promising
his
ideas
and
yours
are
different
as
night
from
day
the
same
words
convey
different
meanings
to
you
and
him
you
would
find
as
you
talked
together
that
there
was
a
gulf
between
you
on
every
serious
subject
no
mother
dear
there
is
no
gulf
we
agree
we
always
agree
i
am
amazed
to
find
how
marvellously
we
agree
said
elma
simply
geoffrey
eyes
flashed
a
look
at
her
a
look
of
adoring
triumph
madame
screwed
her
lips
on
one
side
and
stared
markedly
at
a
corner
of
the
ceiling
mrs
ramsden
wrung
her
hands
in
despair
elma
you
pray
every
night
to
be
delivered
from
temptation
consider
what
your
position
would
be
if
you
married
mr
greville
ask
yourself
if
you
are
strong
enough
to
resist
pride
and
selfishness
and
absorption
in
the
things
of
this
world
many
would
say
that
it
was
a
great
match
for
you
but
i
would
rather
see
you
settled
in
a
cottage
with
enough
money
for
your
daily
needs
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
elma
interrupted
quickly
i
do
think
you
need
be
afraid
mother
i
love
beautiful
things
but
truly
and
honestly
i
believe
they
are
good
for
me
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
explain
but
ugly
things
inartistic
things
they
make
me
feel
cross
and
discontented
while
beauty
is
a
joy
i
need
not
become
proud
and
because
the
things
around
me
are
beautiful
and
rich
with
associations
on
the
contrary
they
ought
to
do
me
good
i
them
so
and
be
so
thankful
that
i
should
want
other
people
to
enjoy
them
too
it
is
riches
themselves
that
one
cares
for
it
is
the
things
that
riches
can
give
madame
had
been
watching
the
girl
face
as
she
spoke
her
own
expression
kindling
in
sympathy
with
views
so
entirely
in
accordance
with
her
own
but
at
the
last
sentence
her
brows
knitted
it
not
a
case
of
riches
my
dear
she
said
quickly
i
do
think
you
understand
the
position
geoffrey
is
a
poor
man
the
estate
brings
in
little
more
than
half
what
it
did
in
his
father
time
and
the
expense
of
keeping
it
up
increases
rather
than
diminishes
as
the
buildings
grow
older
he
ought
to
marry
money
all
these
years
we
have
lived
in
the
expectation
of
a
marriage
which
would
pay
up
old
scores
and
put
things
on
a
better
basis
for
the
future
if
he
marries
a
girl
without
money
he
will
have
to
face
constant
anxiety
and
trouble
elma
turned
to
her
mother
her
delicate
brow
puckered
in
anxiety
i
shall
have
money
sha
i
mother
you
told
me
that
father
left
some
provision
for
me
on
my
marriage
you
are
to
have
three
thousand
pounds
paid
down
if
you
marry
with
my
consent
my
income
is
largely
derived
from
an
annuity
mrs
greville
but
there
will
be
about
another
five
thousand
to
come
to
elma
after
death
madame
bowed
her
head
in
gracious
patronage
very
nice
i
sure
a
very
nice
little
sum
for
pin
money
but
quite
useless
for
our
purposes
do
hate
me
elma
i
am
the
most
unmercenary
of
women
geoffrey
will
tell
you
that
i
am
always
getting
into
debt
but
when
a
man
is
the
owner
of
a
property
which
has
descended
to
him
from
generations
of
ancestors
his
first
duty
is
to
it
it
is
not
right
to
allow
it
to
fall
into
disrepair
for
a
matter
of
sentiment
elma
sat
with
downcast
looks
considering
the
point
while
geoffrey
devoured
her
face
with
hungry
eyes
mrs
ramsden
face
had
flushed
to
a
painful
red
and
she
passed
her
handkerchief
nervously
round
her
lips
she
could
bear
to
torture
her
child
herself
but
not
to
sit
by
and
hear
another
woman
follow
in
her
own
footsteps
the
silence
lasted
for
a
long
minute
before
elma
replied
by
asking
a
question
on
her
own
behalf
can
it
be
right
for
a
man
to
marry
one
woman
for
money
when
he
has
given
his
heart
to
another
mrs
greville
tossed
her
head
with
another
impatient
little
laugh
his
heart
ah
my
dear
a
man
heart
is
an
adaptable
commodity
he
it
as
you
say
many
times
over
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
is
far
more
likely
to
love
a
wife
whose
money
brings
him
ease
and
comfort
than
one
for
whose
pretty
face
he
has
sacrificed
his
peace
elma
turned
to
her
lover
and
looked
deep
into
his
eyes
with
a
strong
effort
he
had
resisted
breaking
into
the
conversation
before
now
but
his
face
was
more
eloquent
than
words
she
smiled
at
him
a
tender
little
smile
of
encouragement
i
am
very
economical
i
would
help
geoffrey
to
save
i
have
not
been
accustomed
to
luxuries
so
it
would
cost
me
nothing
to
do
without
them
and
he
says
he
does
care
do
think
i
am
selfish
mrs
greville
please
i
am
thinking
of
geoffrey
first
but
i
believe
he
would
be
happier
living
quietly
with
me
and
looking
after
the
estate
himself
instead
of
paying
an
agent
to
do
it
than
if
he
sold
himself
for
money
and
ease
we
love
each
other
very
much
we
need
nothing
more
than
just
to
be
together
geoffrey
turned
aside
and
stared
out
of
the
window
the
two
mothers
exchanged
helpless
glances
elma
said
mrs
ramsden
sharply
have
you
no
pride
it
is
hard
enough
for
me
to
sit
by
and
listen
are
you
not
ashamed
to
force
yourself
upon
a
family
where
you
are
not
wanted
when
i
have
looked
forward
to
your
marriage
i
have
always
imagined
that
you
would
be
welcomed
with
open
arms
for
your
own
position
you
are
well
dowered
i
have
been
proud
of
you
all
your
life
too
proud
perhaps
it
would
be
a
bitter
blow
to
me
to
see
you
married
on
sufferance
if
you
have
no
other
feeling
in
the
matter
does
not
your
pride
come
to
your
aid
mother
i
going
to
marry
geoffrey
not
his
family
he
can
take
care
of
his
wife
the
child
is
right
said
madame
quickly
geoffrey
wife
whoever
she
may
be
will
be
treated
with
every
respect
it
is
not
the
judgment
of
others
which
she
need
dread
but
the
judgment
of
her
own
heart
listen
to
me
child
you
are
a
sweet
thing
and
i
love
you
for
your
devotion
to
my
boy
as
i
told
you
before
i
should
be
in
love
with
you
in
his
place
but
i
an
old
woman
and
i
know
the
world
geoffrey
is
not
used
to
work
and
economy
for
a
little
time
while
the
first
glamour
lasted
he
might
be
contented
enough
but
he
would
weary
in
the
end
he
would
surely
weary
and
then
how
would
you
feel
when
you
saw
him
restless
and
discontented
longing
to
leave
you
and
fly
back
to
his
old
life
would
you
feel
no
remorse
love
young
dream
does
not
last
for
ever
my
pretty
child
no
said
elma
quietly
dreams
do
last
but
sometimes
the
awakening
is
better
you
have
known
geoffrey
all
his
life
mrs
greville
and
it
seems
presumptuous
to
pretend
that
i
know
him
even
better
but
i
can
you
believe
he
would
tire
of
me
and
long
to
get
back
to
his
old
luxurious
life
you
think
he
would
love
me
very
much
for
a
little
time
and
then
be
indifferent
and
careless
and
that
i
should
feel
it
was
my
own
fault
but
you
are
wrong
indeed
indeed
you
are
wrong
he
is
your
son
has
he
ever
failed
you
you
say
yourself
that
he
has
been
good
and
true
you
would
trust
him
for
your
own
future
do
you
think
he
would
be
less
loyal
to
his
own
wife
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
i
am
like
you
i
trust
geoffrey
as
she
finished
speaking
she
turned
towards
her
lover
and
held
out
her
hand
towards
him
and
in
two
strides
geoffrey
was
by
her
side
was
on
his
knees
beside
her
holding
that
little
hand
pressed
between
both
his
own
turning
to
look
at
his
mother
with
triumphant
eyes
with
eyes
ashine
with
something
deeper
than
triumph
geoffrey
on
his
knees
tears
in
geoffrey
eyes
madame
stared
in
amaze
then
broke
into
a
sudden
excited
laugh
bravo
elma
bravo
geoffrey
congratulations
my
dears
thank
heaven
you
have
a
mother
who
knows
when
she
is
well
beaten
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
the
girl
sat
bravo
little
elma
i
like
to
see
a
good
fighting
spirit
you
will
make
geoffrey
a
charming
wife
and
i
shall
be
proud
of
my
daughter
she
took
elma
disengaged
hand
and
pressed
it
between
her
own
and
the
girl
smiled
a
happy
response
but
geoffrey
was
oblivious
of
her
presence
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
love
face
with
the
rapt
adoring
gaze
with
which
a
knight
of
old
may
have
gazed
upon
the
vision
of
the
grail
his
mother
looked
at
him
and
her
lips
quivered
artificial
and
frivolous
though
she
was
her
only
son
was
dear
to
her
heart
since
the
hour
of
his
birth
he
had
been
to
her
as
a
pivot
round
which
the
world
revolved
her
son
the
last
of
the
grevilles
who
had
owned
the
manor
since
the
days
of
the
tudors
to
be
alienated
from
him
would
be
the
bitterest
grief
which
life
could
bring
her
grip
tightened
on
the
girl
hand
elma
she
cried
urgently
i
am
geoffrey
mother
he
is
yours
now
and
will
be
swayed
by
you
but
he
has
been
mine
for
years
if
i
have
taken
part
against
you
it
has
been
because
i
believed
it
was
best
for
him
i
have
lost
and
you
have
won
you
will
be
his
wife
the
mistress
of
the
manor
i
do
grudge
you
your
success
but
do
do
bear
me
a
grudge
do
turn
my
boy
against
me
mrs
greville
gasped
elma
breathlessly
mrs
greville
she
pulled
her
hand
from
geoffrey
grasp
and
rose
swiftly
to
her
feet
oh
please
do
think
that
i
could
be
so
mean
i
want
him
to
love
you
more
not
less
i
want
to
be
a
daughter
you
must
not
think
that
i
am
going
to
drive
you
from
your
place
you
must
stay
on
at
the
manor
and
let
me
learn
from
you
there
is
so
much
that
i
shall
have
to
learn
i
shall
be
quite
satisfied
to
be
allowed
to
help
silly
child
said
madame
smiling
she
lifted
her
delicate
ringed
hand
and
stroked
the
girl
cheeks
with
kindly
patronage
you
know
what
you
are
talking
about
my
dear
but
i
fortunately
for
us
all
geoffrey
wife
must
have
no
divided
rule
you
need
not
trouble
your
pretty
head
about
me
norton
palls
at
times
even
to
a
greville
and
i
shall
enjoy
my
liberty
i
go
out
and
spend
a
cold
weather
with
carol
i
have
a
cosy
little
flat
in
town
and
do
the
theatres
enjoy
myself
gadding
about
and
come
down
upon
you
now
and
then
when
i
want
a
rest
but
i
never
with
you
my
dear
be
sure
of
that
it
rather
early
to
make
plans
mater
things
will
arrange
themselves
elma
and
i
will
always
try
to
make
you
happy
said
geoffrey
bluntly
he
too
had
risen
and
stood
by
his
mother
side
flushed
triumphant
a
little
shamefaced
at
the
remembrance
of
his
late
emotion
but
transparently
and
most
radiantly
happy
i
do
all
in
my
power
to
be
a
good
son
to
you
and
to
mrs
ramsden
also
if
she
will
allow
me
he
was
the
first
of
the
three
to
remember
the
existence
of
the
little
woman
in
the
background
the
little
woman
who
was
sobbing
into
her
handkerchief
shedding
bitter
tears
because
forsooth
her
daughter
had
secured
the
biggest
match
in
the
and
was
about
to
become
a
greville
of
norton
manor
chapter
twenty
five
the
parental
summons
arrived
ten
days
after
the
date
of
elma
formal
engagement
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
seventh
week
of
sojourn
in
england
there
it
was
for
all
the
world
to
see
short
authoritative
and
to
the
point
circumstances
had
altered
plan
his
visit
to
europe
must
be
postponed
he
desired
his
daughter
to
return
home
by
the
first
possible
boat
useless
to
exclaim
to
argue
to
condemn
the
command
had
gone
forth
implicit
obedience
must
ensue
will
you
feel
badly
when
i
gone
aunt
soph
cornelia
asked
after
the
news
had
been
broken
she
looked
wistfully
into
the
face
and
felt
herself
answered
as
she
noted
the
involuntary
momentary
hesitation
which
preceded
the
reply
it
will
naturally
be
a
disappointment
to
me
to
miss
seeing
my
brother
but
i
hope
the
pleasure
is
only
deferred
i
am
glad
to
have
had
an
opportunity
of
making
your
acquaintance
my
dear
though
the
time
is
so
curtailed
yes
i
guess
we
an
acquaintance
right
enough
said
cornelia
quietly
seven
weeks
or
seven
years
what
did
it
matter
she
and
this
woman
could
never
become
friends
time
counts
for
nothing
in
the
intercourse
of
souls
an
hour
may
reveal
a
kindred
spirit
no
years
can
bridge
some
gaps
elma
would
remain
a
friend
guest
a
memory
but
her
kinswoman
the
nearest
on
earth
with
the
one
exception
of
her
father
must
for
ever
be
a
stranger
cornelia
was
sad
at
heart
that
day
and
elma
was
sad
too
opening
wide
startled
eyes
and
clasping
her
friend
in
jealous
arms
cornelia
it
is
true
it
be
true
i
ca
spare
you
dear
is
it
really
impossible
to
stay
on
a
little
longer
geoffrey
and
i
counted
on
you
for
our
wedding
it
is
fixed
for
october
and
i
wanted
you
for
a
bridesmaid
i
wanted
you
to
pay
me
a
visit
in
my
own
house
you
have
been
such
a
friend
to
us
both
that
we
you
cornelia
i
shall
miss
you
badly
shucks
returned
cornelia
lightly
you
forget
there
is
such
a
creature
in
existence
should
in
your
place
and
i
do
mind
if
you
do
for
i
know
you
remember
again
another
day
this
is
geoffrey
hour
and
i
wo
interfere
if
i
live
i
pay
you
that
visit
right
enough
and
maybe
you
come
over
to
see
me
i
give
you
a
roaring
time
tell
geoffrey
he
is
bound
to
bring
you
over
to
see
america
i
think
about
you
on
your
but
i
do
know
as
i
sorry
to
do
the
thinking
at
a
distance
are
the
liveliest
occasions
in
the
world
for
the
i
guess
i
feel
pretty
when
you
drove
off
from
the
gates
and
i
found
myself
all
by
my
lonesome
with
the
two
old
girls
i
wired
to
liverpool
about
berths
and
may
have
to
start
off
at
a
day
notice
so
we
got
to
make
the
most
of
the
time
aunt
soph
do
care
she
polite
of
course
but
right
at
the
back
of
her
mind
i
can
see
she
planning
to
clean
out
my
room
and
thinking
how
good
it
will
be
to
have
the
mats
laid
aside
and
the
shroudings
over
the
tables
if
it
was
for
you
moss
rose
i
should
feel
i
done
a
coming
over
at
all
when
all
said
and
done
it
amounts
to
nothing
but
disappointment
and
break
you
mean
began
elma
you
mean
and
then
suddenly
paused
why
should
cornelia
heart
break
disappointment
and
disillusion
would
be
natural
enough
in
one
who
had
experienced
both
coldness
and
deception
within
the
last
few
weeks
but
was
too
strong
a
term
to
elma
with
her
mind
full
to
overflowing
of
that
beloved
geoffrey
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
but
love
could
count
so
seriously
in
life
her
thoughts
flew
to
guest
recalling
all
she
had
heard
of
his
errantry
in
london
of
the
long
hours
which
the
two
had
spent
alone
together
and
later
on
of
the
daily
meetings
in
the
park
planned
for
her
own
benefit
but
none
the
less
opportunities
for
fuller
knowledge
she
fixed
her
blue
eyes
on
cornelia
face
and
asked
a
sudden
question
does
captain
guest
know
that
you
are
going
how
should
he
returned
cornelia
lightly
eyes
and
lips
were
unflinching
but
all
the
will
in
the
world
could
not
keep
the
blood
from
her
cheeks
he
visiting
somewhere
at
the
other
end
of
the
country
with
old
friends
who
belong
to
his
own
world
and
feel
the
same
way
about
the
same
things
let
him
stay
and
be
happy
i
do
want
him
to
come
worrying
down
here
for
the
fun
of
saying
guess
he
had
trouble
enough
about
my
affairs
mind
now
elma
you
are
not
to
tell
him
this
is
my
affair
and
i
wo
have
you
interfere
elma
meekly
disavowed
any
intention
of
communicating
with
captain
guest
but
like
many
other
meek
people
she
harboured
a
quiet
reservation
which
annulled
the
promise
she
would
not
write
but
geoffrey
could
geoffrey
that
flame
in
cornelia
cheek
satisfied
her
that
the
girl
interest
was
deeper
than
she
would
admit
and
if
guest
returned
the
feeling
what
joy
what
rapture
to
have
cornelia
settled
in
england
to
look
forward
to
a
life
of
constant
intercourse
cornelia
had
helped
her
according
to
her
lights
elma
was
determined
to
help
cornelia
also
with
disconcerting
swiftness
a
return
telegram
arrived
from
liverpool
stating
that
owing
to
illness
a
passenger
had
been
suddenly
obliged
to
resign
a
on
the
boat
sailing
on
the
following
saturday
and
that
the
accommodation
would
be
reserved
pending
miss
confirmation
an
immediate
reply
was
requested
cornelia
gasped
and
hesitated
four
days
four
days
and
then
farewell
to
england
and
english
friends
she
had
not
expected
anything
so
speedy
as
this
during
these
summer
months
berths
were
engaged
so
long
ahead
that
it
was
generally
a
most
difficult
thing
to
arrange
for
a
speedy
passage
she
had
been
told
of
this
over
and
over
again
had
known
of
her
friends
difficulties
in
such
matters
in
the
background
of
her
mind
had
counted
on
a
similar
delay
in
her
own
case
in
a
week
or
a
fortnight
much
might
happen
but
in
four
days
she
stood
battling
with
temptation
while
mary
watched
her
with
anxious
eyes
no
one
but
herself
knew
the
purport
of
the
message
no
one
need
know
if
the
answer
were
a
refusal
two
or
three
scribbled
words
would
give
her
a
reprieve
poor
cornelia
she
realised
afresh
how
easy
it
was
to
be
brave
in
anticipation
how
bitterly
hard
in
actual
fact
she
was
silent
so
long
that
mary
summoned
up
courage
to
ask
a
question
is
it
bad
news
miss
cornelia
stared
at
her
blankly
for
a
moment
and
valiantly
forced
a
smile
i
guess
there
two
sides
to
it
as
there
are
to
most
things
in
this
world
my
poppar
think
it
splendid
but
you
hate
it
badly
enough
i
going
pretty
quick
mury
you
wo
have
me
but
four
days
more
the
truth
was
out
she
had
burned
her
boats
and
made
retreat
impossible
while
mary
wept
and
lamented
cornelia
wrote
the
confirmatory
wire
and
sent
it
out
to
the
waiting
messenger
then
mary
returned
to
continue
her
lamentations
i
wish
i
could
marry
him
and
be
done
with
it
i
ca
seem
to
face
staying
on
here
with
no
one
but
her
in
the
house
nagging
at
us
all
the
day
i
have
to
make
another
move
she
proclaimed
dismally
in
mary
converse
the
singular
pronoun
when
masculine
always
applied
to
her
friend
when
feminine
to
her
mistress
cornelia
had
grasped
this
fact
and
had
therefore
no
difficulty
in
understanding
her
meaning
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
stared
at
the
maid
with
serious
eyes
do
you
love
him
mury
enough
to
marry
him
and
live
beside
him
every
one
day
to
the
end
of
your
life
you
think
you
would
not
get
mary
hesitated
unwilling
to
commit
herself
i
would
like
to
go
so
far
as
that
she
announced
judicially
he
aggravates
me
at
times
something
cruel
but
i
sooner
be
aggravated
by
him
nor
anyone
else
they
talk
a
lot
of
rubbish
about
love
miss
cornelia
but
that
about
the
size
of
it
when
all
said
and
done
some
people
suit
you
and
others
do
and
all
the
in
the
world
wo
make
why
mury
you
are
a
philosopher
it
the
dead
truth
mury
but
i
guess
you
need
rub
it
if
you
made
up
your
mind
why
need
you
wait
furniture
miss
i
told
him
i
wo
marry
to
go
into
rooms
not
if
it
ever
so
i
wait
till
i
get
a
of
me
own
he
put
by
a
goodish
bit
and
so
had
i
but
things
have
been
agen
us
he
was
out
of
work
four
months
last
winter
and
mother
legs
are
a
awful
drain
liniments
and
bandages
and
you
ca
see
your
own
mother
suffer
and
not
pay
out
we
got
to
wait
till
we
save
up
again
how
much
money
does
it
take
to
furnish
a
cottage
over
here
mury
that
depends
on
how
it
done
you
can
do
it
for
forty
pounds
i
lived
with
a
girl
who
did
hers
for
twenty
but
i
like
to
be
as
close
as
that
i
reckon
about
thirty
thirty
pounds
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
cornelia
gasped
in
astonishment
at
the
smallness
of
the
sum
you
ca
mean
that
that
includes
everything
chairs
and
tables
and
carpets
and
dishes
and
beds
and
bureaus
and
brooms
and
tins
and
curtains
and
and
all
the
fixing
to
put
up
it
is
possible
you
can
get
them
all
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
you
can
miss
there
a
shop
in
the
fore
street
where
they
do
you
everything
complete
for
three
rooms
for
thirty
pounds
with
a
velvet
suite
for
the
parlour
lady
chair
gent
chair
sofa
and
four
uprights
with
chiffonnier
and
overmantel
and
all
you
could
wish
for
anything
better
the
girl
i
lived
with
had
only
a
few
odd
bits
be
ashamed
to
have
such
a
poor
sort
of
in
the
kitchen
they
give
you
a
dresser
and
a
and
linoleum
on
the
floor
jim
and
me
went
to
the
shop
one
day
to
have
a
look
round
that
was
when
he
had
a
bit
put
by
mary
sighed
and
flicked
away
a
tear
and
now
you
going
next
i
getting
a
bit
sick
of
bad
luck
i
am
cornelia
was
bending
forward
in
her
seat
her
chin
supported
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
her
expression
was
very
grave
and
wistful
but
in
her
eyes
shone
the
light
of
awakened
interest
mury

real
good
and
attentive
to
me
i
guess
i
given
you
quite
a
heap
of
trouble

present
before

to
that
store
and
make
your
own
bargains
and
i
leave
thirty
pounds
with
miss
ramsden
to
pay
the
bills
i
like
to
feel
i
helped
you
to
a
home
of
your
own
mury
mary
clutched
the
back
of
a
chair
near
to
which
she
was
standing
her
eyes
protruded
her
chin
dropped
speech
failed
her
in
the
excess
of
emotion
she
could
only
stare
and
gasp
and
stare
again
poor
mury
said
cornelia
softly
are
you
so
pleased
i
want
you
should
be
pleased
if
i

someone
happy

going
shopping
with
your
friend
mury
bossing
round
in
that
store
choosing
the
things

want
and
putting
on
airs
as
if

bank

on
the
mantelpiece
in
that
parlour
and
when
you
dust
it
in
the
mornings
you
can
send
me
a
kind
thought
over
all
those
miles
of
ocean
and
think
of
you
sitting
in
the
lady
chair
for
the
land
sake
girl
do
have
a
fit
you
do
need
to
have
a
thing
unless
you
say
so
oh
miss
cornelia
sobbed
mary
brokenly
you
too
i
so
an
miss
cornelia
that
what
you
are
jim
will
go
off
his
head
when
he
hears
it
a
sort
of
thing
you
ca
seem
to
i
loved
to
wait
on
you
miss
if
you
never
given
me
a
thing
i
have
loved
it
all
the
same
you
talked
so
kind
and
took
such
an
interest
and
was
always
so
lively
and
laughing
it
was
for
what
i
could
get
but
the
house
to
have
a
house
thrown
at
you
as
you
may
say
at
a
moment
notice
it
takes
away
my
breath
i
ca
seem
to
take
it
in
but
you
are
happy
mury
you
feel
happy
to
think
of
it
i
should
think
i
do
just
clean
dazed
with
happiness
poor
mury
said
cornelia
again
she
looked
across
the
room
at
the
flushed
ecstatic
face
of
the
prospective
bride
and
smiled
with
tender
sympathy
i
real
glad
you
pleased
just
as
soon
as
dinner
over
you
must
go
out
and
tell
your
friend
i
fix
it
up
with
aunt
soph
you
have
a
fine
time
wo
you
he
wo
believe
it
true
but
you
him
believe
and
be
as
happy
as
grigs
walking
round
and
planning
out
that
parlour
come
into
my
room
when
you
get
back
and
tell
me
what
he
says
i
sha
be
asleep
there
seemed
no
time
for
sleep
during
the
next
few
days
the
mornings
were
devoted
to
packing
and
to
long
confidential
interviews
with
elma
the
afternoons
to
a
succession
of
to
which
every
old
lady
in
norton
was
bidden
in
turns
to
say
the
same
things
and
breathe
the
same
pious
good
wishes
the
evenings
to
decorous
cribbage
matches
with
her
aunt
the
nights
the
nights
were
cornelia
own
secret
but
they
left
a
wan
damsel
to
yawn
at
the
each
morning
when
the
last
hour
arrived
the
very
last
cornelia
friends
assembled
at
the
station
to
bid
her
miss
briskett
tall
and
angular
in
her
new
grey
costume
mrs
ramsden
with
the
black
feather
fiercely
erect
in
the
front
of
her
bonnet
lovely
blooming
elma
attended
by
her
swain
and
in
the
background
the
faithful
mary
holding
on
to
the
and
sniffing
dolorously
cornelia
had
refused
to
be
escorted
farther
on
the
journey
and
now
that
the
hour
had
arrived
her
one
longing
was
to
say
her
farewells
and
be
left
to
herself
she
was
eager
to
be
off
yet
when
the
train
steamed
slowly
out
of
the
station
she
was
gripped
by
a
strange
swift
spasm
of
anguish
not
on
her
friends
behalf
aunt
soph
had
made
no
pretence
of
anything
beyond
polite
regret
elma
and
mary
shared
a
personal
happiness
so
deep
that
for
the
time
at
least
the
departure
of
a
friend
held
no
lasting
sting
cornelia
could
wave
adieu
to
each
rejoicing
in
their
joy
in
the
remembrance
that
she
had
had
some
small
share
in
bringing
it
about
yet
the
torturing
pain
continued
the
desolating
ache
of
disappointment
what
was
it
for
which
she
had
waited
what
hope
had
lived
persistent
at
the
back
of
her
mind
while
she
had
pretended
that
she
had
no
hope
she
knew
now
that
hour
by
hour
she
had
lived
in
the
expectation
of
return
had
felt
an
unreassuring
conviction
that
he
must
come
before
she
left
that
she
had
done
her
utmost
to
prevent
his
coming
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
surely
when
she
had
so
sternly
followed
the
dictates
of
reason
there
was
all
the
more
need
for
some
good
fairy
to
weave
a
miracle
which
should
upset
her
plans
something
must
happen
something
at
it
is
so
difficult
to
believe
in
the
irrevocable
the
journey
to
london
was
alive
with
memories
in
this
corner
she
had
sat
watching
guest
face
listening
to
his
voice
as
he
told
the
story
of
his
life
at
this
landscape
they
had
looked
together
admiring
and
comparing
tastes
and
impressions
at
paddington
mrs
moffatt
had
stood
in
waiting
upon
the
platform
cornelia
was
thankful
to
be
safe
inside
the
away
from
the
pressing
memories
here
the
atmosphere
was
of
home
eye
and
ear
caught
on
every
side
the
familiar
accent
the
familiar
phraseology
the
familiar
tilt
of
the
hat
and
squaring
of
shoulder
the
passenger
list
included
more
than
one
name
and
once
afloat
she
was
sure
of
companionship
she
settled
down
in
her
corner
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
of
one
who
has
reached
a
haven
after
struggling
in
deep
waters
this
was
a
foretaste
of
home
these
people
were
her
own
kindred
their
ways
were
her
ways
their
thoughts
her
thoughts
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
on
english
soil
she
felt
the
rest
of
being
in
perfect
accord
with
her
surroundings
with
cornelia
america
was
a
passion
life
away
from
her
native
land
was
only
half
a
life
aboard
the
great
steamer
the
passengers
were
rushing
to
and
fro
searching
for
their
and
when
found
depositing
their
impedimenta
on
the
tops
of
the
narrow
white
bunks
cornelia
walked
to
the
quietest
corner
of
the
deck
dropped
her
bag
on
a
seat
and
leant
idly
over
the
rail
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
go
below
and
held
instinctively
aloof
from
the
groups
of
and
their
friends
she
was
alone
and
her
heart
was
sad
someone
walking
quickly
along
the
deck
caught
sight
of
the
solitary
figure
in
the
trim
dress
and
recognised
its
outline
before
a
turn
of
the
head
revealed
the
glorious
flaming
hair
someone
with
a
grim
face
pale
beneath
his
tan
with
haggard
lines
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
a
man
whose
looks
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
had
been
awake
all
night
face
to
face
with
calamity
he
walked
straight
to
the
side
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
cornelia
cornelia
turned
swiftly
and
a
light
leapt
into
her
eyes
a
light
of
joy
so
pure
and
involuntary
that
at
sight
of
it
the
man
face
lost
something
of
its
grim
tension
he
turned
his
back
so
as
to
screen
the
girl
from
the
and
his
hand
tightened
on
her
arm
cornelia
are
you
running
away
from
me
she
did
not
answer
but
her
silence
gave
assent
her
silence
and
a
quiet
bend
of
the
head
why
i
was
afraid
breathed
cornelia
low
beneath
the
cap
guest
could
see
her
lips
tremble
the
little
face
looked
white
and
tense
she
twisted
her
fingers
nervously
afraid
of
me
and
my
love
afraid
that
i
should
come
back
to
trouble
you
afraid
of
my
selfishness
cornelia
the
curling
lips
breathed
a
faint
dissent
of
what
then
we
have
only
a
few
minutes
left
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
now
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
brave
pitiful
eyes
mutely
imploring
for
mercy
of
myself
of
my
own
weakness
afraid
lest
i
might
give
way
and
ruin
two
lives
you
knew
that
i
loved
you
that
i
had
gone
away
to
prove
my
love
to
see
if
it
would
stand
the
test
of
absence
it
was
a
serious
matter
for
us
both
and
i
would
not
let
myself
act
on
the
spur
of
an
impulse
if
i
had
cornelia
you
know
that
i
should
have
spoken
long
ago
that
night
on
the
river
you
knew
it
at
the
time
i
saw
it
in
your
i
made
you
promise
to
let
me
know
if
you
left
norton
during
my
absence
it
was
not
fair
to
run
away
i
never
promised
i
never
did
you
asked
me
but
i
did
promise
i
felt
at
the
time
that
i
must
leave
the
words
came
in
quick
gasping
breaths
as
a
child
might
speak
who
tried
to
justify
himself
to
his
taskmaster
guest
face
softened
at
the
sound
and
his
grasp
of
the
girl
arm
turned
into
a
caress
darling
do
you
see
what
that
means
you
love
me
or
you
would
not
be
afraid
geoffrey
wrote
to
me
giving
me
warning
but
the
letter
only
reached
me
late
yesterday
night
i
have
been
travelling
ever
since
i
just
managed
to
be
here
in
time
if
i
had
missed
the
boat
i
should
have
come
after
you
do
you
think
a
few
thousand
miles
are
going
to
keep
us
apart
cornelia
she
shook
her
head
sadly
no
no
distance
in
space
just
the
distance
between
our
two
selves
the
distance
that
ca
be
bridged
we
belong
to
different
worlds
you
and
i
we
could
never
be
happy
together
you
love
forms
and
ceremonies
and
conventions
all
the
things
that
worry
me
most
and
make
me
feel
ugly
it
the
height
of
your
ambition
to
settle
down
in
your
old
home
and
to
keep
things
rolling
along
in
the
same
old
ruts
that
they
run
in
for
centuries
i
want
change
and
excitement
and
the
newest
there
is
your
quiet
english
life
would
get
on
my
nerves
poppar
and
i
have
had
lots
of
ups
and
downs
and
i
never
lost
grit
i
ken
bear
a
good
big
blow
but
to
stodge
along
every
day
the
same
dull
round
would
drive
me
crazed
we
live
quickly
over
with
us
and
you
so
slow
i
do
say
that
the
advantage
is
all
on
our
side
i
used
to
laugh
at
english
girls
but
i
do
any
longer
since
i
known
elma
ramsden
if
i
were
a
man
elma
the
sort
i
want
for
my
wife
you
find
another
like
her
some
day
and
be
thankful
you
are
free
you
love
me
now
but
your
love
would
not
stand
the
strain
of
pulling
separate
ways
all
our
lives
guest
gazed
at
her
with
gloomy
eyes
you
do
love
me
or
you
would
not
think
of
anything
else
whatever
may
be
the
differences
between
us
you
are
the
one
woman
i
have
ever
wanted
for
my
wife
i
ca
bear
to
let
you
go
do
trifle
with
me
for
the
few
minutes
that
are
left
tell
me
honestly
how
we
stand
do
you
love
me
cornelia
i
answered
cornelia
slowly
her
cheeks
flushed
beneath
his
gaze
and
the
white
lids
drooped
over
the
honest
eyes
it
was
just
finding
out
how
easy
it
would
be
that
sent
me
running
home
the
people
at
norton
think
it
was
poppar
doing
but
i
tell
you
straight
that
i
asked
him
to
send
for
me
life
a
big
chance
we
got
to
make
the
best
we
know
out
of
it
for
ourselves
and
other
people
i
mean
to
spoil
things
for
us
both
you
did
to
love
me
right
at
the
back
of
your
mind
you
felt
all
the
time
that
i
was
not
your
mate
you
went
away
to
think
it
out
perhaps
if
the
known
you
were
still
undecided
when
the
news
of
my
sailing
brought
you
up
with
a
run
when
i
am
gone
and
you
have
had
time
to
cool
down
you
be
glad
guest
repeated
the
word
with
bitter
emphasis
i
shall
be
glad
shall
i
at
the
present
moment
in
any
case
i
am
the
most
miserable
man
on
earth
have
you
no
pity
cornelia
will
nothing
move
you
think
how
happy
we
have
been
together
if
we
loved
each
other
surely
we
could
outlive
the
differences
can
you
bear
to
go
away
like
this
and
leave
me
for
ever
is
it
nothing
to
you
how
i
suffer
do
you
cornelia
yes
i
care
she
answered
simply
it
but
it
going
to
hurt
a
lot
more
if
i
stay
behind
if
we
lived
together
it
would
be
like
trying
to
piece
together
the
bits
of
two
different
puzzles
we
fit
the
simple
words
expressed
the
truth
with
paralysing
force
even
at
that
bitter
moment
guest
recognised
their
truth
and
was
dumb
before
it
he
turned
aside
his
strong
jaw
working
with
emotion
powerless
to
fight
any
longer
against
the
rock
of
cornelia
will
behind
him
lay
the
grey
city
wrapped
in
its
veil
of
smoke
the
tall
spire
of
the
old
church
rising
in
picturesque
isolation
above
the
line
of
the
surrounding
buildings
it
seemed
at
that
moment
to
stand
as
a
symbol
of
the
life
of
the
mother
country
a
life
fenced
in
by
convention
by
forms
and
ceremonies
sanctified
to
every
englishman
by
centuries
of
association
forms
at
which
he
may
at
times
smile
or
scoff
but
which
he
would
no
sooner
demolish
than
he
would
tear
away
the
clustering
ivy
which
clothes
his
walls
before
him
lay
the
broad
river
its
mouth
widening
to
the
sea
to
that
free
untrammelled
waste
of
waters
which
were
a
fit
symbol
of
that
land
of
the
west
whose
daughter
could
place
her
liberty
even
before
her
love
there
came
a
sudden
stir
and
movement
a
second
time
the
bell
clanged
its
warning
and
the
visitors
began
to
stream
towards
the
gangway
guest
heard
the
sound
of
a
strangled
sob
and
felt
his
own
heart
beat
with
suffocating
quickness
i
i
ca
face
it
he
cried
desperately
i
wo
take
this
as
an
answer
if
i
had
time
i
could
you
listen
to
me
i
could
make
you
agree
i
shall
come
after
you
to
new
york
she
turned
aside
but
not
so
quickly
that
he
did
not
catch
the
sudden
light
in
her
eyes
the
same
involuntary
gleam
of
joy
which
had
greeted
his
coming
a
few
minutes
before
the
sight
of
that
signal
made
his
heart
leap
but
cornelia
shook
her
head
and
her
voice
broke
in
a
ho
it
would
be
a
mistake
wait
here
wait
quietly
at
first
it
will
hurt
but
after
a
while
you
be
glad
you
find
that
other
things
come
first
you
think
now
that
you
will
come
after
me
but
i
know
you
better
you
will
never
come
you
not
want
me
any
more
guest
laughed
a
strained
little
laugh
of
excitement
and
exultation
cornelia
might
preach
prudence
and
hold
fast
to
her
own
ideas
but
at
least
she
had
not
forbidden
his
coming
had
not
said
in
so
many
words
i
will
not
see
you
for
the
moment
at
least
he
had
triumphed
he
was
confident
that
the
future
also
would
be
his
own
we
will
discuss
that
question
on
our
next
meeting
he
cried
breathlessly
i
will
wait
as
long
as
you
like
undergo
any
test
you
like
to
decree
but
i
will
come
cornelia
breathed
cornelia
low
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
but
now
there
was
no
light
in
the
golden
depths
but
only
a
deep
and
immeasurable
sadness
guest
wrung
her
hand
and
turned
aside
there
was
no
time
left
to
reason
further
the
future
alone
could
prove
the
depth
and
stability
of
his
love
he
made
his
way
to
the
gangway
his
heart
wrung
with
the
sense
of
loss
of
wounded
love
and
pride
by
his
side
men
and
women
sobbed
and
cried
while
others
laughed
and
exchanged
merry
banter
with
their
friends
on
board
to
some
this
meant
a
parting
for
life
to
others
a
pleasure
excursion
across
the
ocean
ferry
among
them
all
was
there
one
whose
loss
was
as
his
own
a
wild
impulse
seized
him
to
push
his
way
back
and
remain
on
the
boat
for
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
but
the
steady
stream
bore
him
onward
and
as
in
a
dream
he
found
himself
standing
on
the
stage
and
saw
the
gangway
descend
he
stood
in
the
crowd
and
heard
a
woman
sob
by
his
side
she
was
waving
her
handkerchief
to
a
man
who
stood
on
the
spot
which
cornelia
had
vacated
but
a
minute
before
now
she
had
disappeared
guest
eyes
searched
for
her
hungrily
but
in
vain
it
was
only
as
the
vessel
slowly
moved
from
the
stage
that
she
came
into
sight
a
small
dark
figure
standing
alone
on
the
upper
deck
with
the
sunlight
shining
on
ruddy
locks
and
