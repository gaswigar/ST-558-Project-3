chapter
there
were
times
when
we
had
to
go
without
puddings
to
pay
john
s
uniform
bills
and
always
i
did
the
facings
myself
with
a
to
save
getting
new
ones
i
would
have
polished
his
sword
too
if
i
had
been
allowed
i
adored
his
sword
and
once
i
remember
we
painted
and
varnished
our
own
and
very
smart
it
looked
to
save
fifty
rupees
we
had
nothing
but
our
pay
john
had
his
company
when
we
were
married
but
what
is
that
and
life
was
made
up
of
small
knowing
economies
much
more
amusing
in
recollection
than
in
practise
we
were
sodden
poor
and
that
is
a
fact
poor
and
conscientious
which
was
worse
a
big
fat
spider
of
a
came
one
day
into
the
veranda
and
tempted
us
we
lived
in
a
hut
but
it
had
a
veranda
and
john
threatened
to
report
him
to
the
police
poor
when
everybody
else
had
enough
to
live
in
the
indian
fashion
that
was
what
made
it
so
hard
we
were
alone
in
our
sordid
little
ways
when
the
expectation
of
cecily
came
to
us
we
made
out
to
be
delighted
knowing
that
the
whole
station
pitied
us
and
when
cecily
came
herself
with
a
swamping
burst
of
expense
we
kept
up
the
pretense
splendidly
she
was
peevish
poor
little
thing
and
she
threatened
convulsions
from
the
beginning
but
we
both
knew
that
it
was
abnormal
not
to
love
her
a
great
deal
more
than
life
immediately
and
increasingly
and
we
applied
ourselves
honestly
to
do
it
with
the
thermometer
at
a
hundred
and
two
and
the
nurse
leaving
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
because
she
discovered
that
i
had
only
six
of
everything
for
the
table
to
find
out
a
husband
s
virtues
you
must
marry
a
poor
man
the
regiment
was
as
usual
and
john
had
to
take
parade
at
daylight
quite
three
times
a
week
but
he
walked
up
and
down
the
veranda
with
cecily
constantly
till
two
in
the
morning
when
a
little
coolness
came
i
usually
lay
awake
the
rest
of
the
night
in
fear
that
a
scorpion
would
drop
from
the
ceiling
on
her
nevertheless
we
were
of
excellent
mind
towards
cecily
we
were
in
such
terror
not
so
much
of
failing
in
our
duty
towards
her
as
towards
the
ideal
standard
of
mankind
we
were
very
anxious
indeed
not
to
come
short
to
be
found
too
small
for
one
s
place
in
nature
would
have
been
odious
we
would
talk
about
her
for
an
hour
at
a
time
even
when
john
s
charger
was
threatening
glanders
and
i
could
see
his
mind
perpetually
wandering
to
the
stable
i
would
say
to
john
that
she
had
brought
a
new
element
into
our
lives
she
had
indeed
and
john
would
reply
i
know
what
you
mean
and
go
on
to
prophesy
that
she
would
bind
us
we
didn
t
need
binding
together
we
were
more
to
each
other
there
in
the
desolation
of
that
arid
frontier
outpost
than
most
husbands
and
wives
but
it
seemed
a
proper
and
hopeful
thing
to
believe
so
we
believed
it
of
course
the
real
experience
would
have
come
we
weren
t
monsters
but
fate
curtailed
the
opportunity
she
was
just
five
weeks
old
when
the
doctor
told
us
that
we
must
either
pack
her
home
immediately
or
lose
her
and
the
very
next
day
john
went
down
with
enteric
so
cecily
was
sent
to
england
with
a
sergeant
s
wife
who
had
lost
her
twins
and
i
settled
down
under
the
direction
of
a
native
doctor
to
fight
for
my
husband
s
life
without
ice
or
proper
food
or
sickroom
comforts
of
any
sort
ah
fort
samila
with
the
sun
glaring
up
from
the
sand
however
it
is
a
long
time
ago
now
i
trusted
the
baby
willingly
to
berry
and
to
providence
and
did
not
fret
my
capacity
for
worry
i
suppose
was
completely
absorbed
berry
s
letter
describing
the
child
s
improvement
on
the
voyage
and
safe
arrival
came
i
remember
the
day
on
which
john
was
allowed
his
first
solid
mouthful
it
had
been
a
long
siege
poor
little
wretch
he
said
when
i
read
it
aloud
and
after
that
cecily
became
an
episode
she
had
gone
to
my
husband
s
people
it
was
the
best
arrangement
we
were
lucky
that
it
was
possible
so
many
children
had
to
be
sent
to
strangers
and
hirelings
since
an
unfortunate
infant
must
be
brought
into
the
world
and
set
adrift
the
haven
of
its
grandmother
and
its
aunt
emma
and
its
aunt
alice
certainly
seemed
providential
i
had
absolutely
no
cause
for
anxiety
as
i
often
told
people
wondering
that
i
did
not
feel
a
little
all
the
same
nothing
i
knew
could
exceed
the
conscientious
devotion
of
all
three
farnham
ladies
to
the
child
she
would
appear
upon
their
somewhat
barren
horizon
as
a
new
and
interesting
duty
and
the
small
additional
income
she
also
represented
would
be
almost
nominal
compensation
for
the
care
she
would
receive
they
were
excellent
persons
of
the
kind
that
talk
about
matins
and
vespers
and
attend
both
they
helped
little
charities
and
gave
little
teas
and
wrote
little
notes
and
made
deprecating
allowance
for
the
eccentricities
of
their
titled
or
moneyed
acquaintances
they
were
the
subdued
smiling
unimaginatively
dressed
women
on
a
small
definite
income
that
you
meet
at
every
rectory
in
the
country
a
little
snobbish
a
little
priggish
wholly
conventional
but
apart
from
these
weaknesses
sound
and
simple
and
dignified
managing
their
two
small
servants
with
a
display
of
the
most
exact
traditions
and
keeping
a
somewhat
vague
and
belated
but
constant
eye
upon
the
doings
of
their
country
as
chronicled
in
a
paper
they
were
all
immensely
interested
in
royalty
and
would
read
paragraphs
aloud
to
each
other
about
how
the
princess
beatrice
or
the
princess
maud
had
opened
a
fancy
bazaar
looking
remarkably
well
in
plain
grey
poplin
trimmed
with
irish
lace
an
industry
which
as
is
well
known
the
royal
family
has
set
its
heart
on
rehabilitating
upon
which
farnham
s
comment
invariably
would
be
how
thoughtful
of
them
dear
and
alice
would
usually
say
well
if
i
were
a
princess
i
should
like
something
nicer
than
plain
grey
alice
being
the
youngest
was
not
always
expected
to
think
before
she
spoke
alice
painted
in
but
emma
was
supposed
to
have
the
most
common
sense
they
took
turns
in
writing
to
us
with
the
greatest
regularity
about
cecily
only
once
i
think
did
they
miss
the
weekly
mail
and
that
was
when
she
threatened
diphtheria
and
they
thought
we
had
better
be
kept
in
ignorance
the
kind
and
affectionate
terms
of
these
letters
never
altered
except
with
the
facts
they
described
teething
creeping
measles
cheeks
growing
round
and
rosy
all
were
conveyed
in
the
same
smooth
pat
and
proper
phrases
so
absolutely
empty
of
any
glimpse
of
the
child
s
personality
that
after
the
first
few
months
it
was
like
reading
about
a
somewhat
uninteresting
infant
in
a
book
i
was
sure
cecily
was
not
uninteresting
but
her
chroniclers
were
we
used
to
wade
through
the
long
thin
sheets
and
saw
how
much
more
satisfactory
it
would
be
when
cecily
could
write
to
us
herself
meanwhile
we
noted
her
weekly
progress
with
much
the
feeling
one
would
have
about
a
little
bit
of
property
that
was
giving
no
trouble
and
coming
on
exceedingly
well
we
would
take
possession
of
cecily
at
our
convenience
till
then
it
was
gratifying
to
hear
of
our
unearned
increment
in
dear
little
dimples
and
sweet
little
curls
she
was
nearly
four
when
i
saw
her
again
we
were
home
on
three
months
leave
john
had
just
got
his
first
brevet
for
doing
something
which
he
does
not
allow
me
to
talk
about
in
the
black
mountain
country
and
we
were
fearfully
pleased
with
ourselves
i
remember
that
excitement
lasted
well
up
to
port
said
as
far
as
the
canal
cecily
was
only
one
of
the
pleasures
and
interests
we
were
going
home
to
john
s
majority
was
the
thing
that
really
gave
savour
to
life
but
the
first
faint
line
of
europe
brought
my
child
to
my
horizon
and
all
the
rest
of
the
way
she
kept
her
place
holding
out
her
little
arms
to
me
beckoning
me
on
her
four
motherless
years
brought
compunction
to
my
heart
and
tears
to
my
eyes
she
should
have
all
the
compensation
that
could
be
i
suddenly
realized
how
ready
i
was
how
ready
to
have
her
back
i
rebelled
fiercely
against
john
s
decision
that
we
must
not
take
her
with
us
on
our
return
to
the
frontier
privately
i
resolved
to
dispute
it
and
if
necessary
i
saw
myself
abducting
the
child
my
own
child
my
days
and
nights
as
the
ship
crept
on
were
full
of
a
long
ache
to
possess
her
the
defrauded
tenderness
of
the
last
four
years
rose
up
in
me
and
sometimes
caught
at
my
throat
i
could
think
and
talk
and
dream
of
nothing
else
john
indulged
me
as
much
as
was
reasonable
and
only
once
betrayed
by
a
yawn
that
the
subject
was
not
for
him
endlessly
absorbing
then
i
cried
and
he
apologized
you
know
he
said
it
isn
t
exactly
the
same
thing
i
m
not
her
at
which
i
dried
my
tears
and
expanded
proud
and
pacified
i
was
her
mother
then
the
rainy
little
station
and
alice
in
a
damp
waterproof
and
the
drive
in
the
fly
and
john
s
mother
at
the
gate
and
a
necessary
pause
while
i
kissed
john
s
mother
dear
thing
she
wanted
to
hold
our
hands
and
look
into
our
faces
and
tell
us
how
little
we
had
changed
for
all
our
hardships
and
on
the
way
to
the
house
she
actually
stopped
to
point
out
some
alterations
in
the
at
last
the
door
and
the
smiling
housemaid
turning
the
handle
and
the
unforgettable
picture
of
a
little
girl
a
little
girl
unlike
anything
we
had
imagined
starting
bravely
to
trot
across
the
room
with
the
little
speech
that
had
been
taught
her
she
came
i
suppose
our
regards
were
too
fixed
too
absorbed
for
there
she
stopped
with
a
wail
of
terror
at
the
strange
faces
and
ran
straight
back
to
the
outstretched
arms
of
her
aunt
emma
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
no
doubt
i
walked
over
to
a
chair
opposite
with
my
and
umbrella
and
sat
down
a
spectator
aloof
and
silent
aunt
emma
fondled
and
quieted
the
child
apologizing
for
her
to
me
coaxing
her
to
look
up
but
the
little
figure
still
shook
with
sobs
hiding
its
face
in
the
bosom
that
it
knew
i
smiled
politely
like
any
other
stranger
at
emma
s
deprecations
and
sat
impassive
looking
at
my
alleged
baby
breaking
her
heart
at
the
sight
of
her
mother
it
is
not
amusing
even
now
to
remember
the
anger
that
i
felt
i
did
not
touch
her
or
speak
to
her
i
simply
sat
observing
my
alien
possession
in
the
frock
i
had
not
made
and
the
sash
i
had
not
chosen
being
coaxed
and
kissed
and
protected
and
petted
by
its
aunt
emma
presently
i
asked
to
be
taken
to
my
room
and
there
i
locked
myself
in
for
two
atrocious
hours
just
once
my
heart
beat
high
when
a
tiny
knock
came
and
a
timid
docile
little
voice
said
that
tea
was
ready
but
i
heard
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
and
guessed
the
directing
angel
in
aunt
emma
and
responded
thank
you
dear
run
away
and
say
that
i
am
coming
with
a
pleasant
visitor
s
inflection
which
i
was
able
to
sustain
for
the
rest
of
afternoon
she
goes
to
bed
at
seven
said
emma
oh
does
she
said
i
a
very
good
hour
i
should
she
sleeps
in
my
room
said
farnham
we
give
her
mutton
broth
very
often
but
seldom
stock
soup
said
aunt
emma
mamma
thinks
it
is
too
indeed
said
i
to
all
of
it
they
took
me
up
to
see
her
in
her
crib
and
pointed
out
as
she
lay
asleep
that
though
she
had
a
general
look
of
me
her
features
were
distinctively
farnham
won
t
you
kiss
her
asked
alice
you
haven
t
kissed
her
yet
and
she
is
used
to
so
much
i
don
t
think
i
could
take
such
an
advantage
of
her
i
said
they
looked
at
each
other
and
farnham
said
that
i
was
plainly
worn
out
i
mustn
t
sit
up
to
prayers
if
i
had
been
given
anything
like
reasonable
time
i
might
have
made
a
fight
for
it
but
four
weeks
it
took
a
month
each
way
in
those
days
was
too
absurdly
little
i
could
do
nothing
but
i
would
not
stay
at
mamma
s
it
was
more
than
i
would
ask
of
myself
that
daily
disappointment
under
the
mask
of
gratified
discovery
for
long
i
spent
an
approving
unnatural
week
in
my
farcical
character
bridling
my
resentment
and
hiding
my
mortification
with
pretty
phrases
and
then
i
went
up
to
town
and
drowned
my
sorrows
in
the
summer
sales
i
took
john
with
me
i
may
have
been
cecily
s
mother
in
theory
but
i
was
john
s
wife
in
fact
we
went
back
to
the
frontier
and
the
regiment
saw
a
lot
of
service
that
meant
medals
and
fun
for
my
husband
but
economy
and
anxiety
for
me
though
i
managed
to
be
allowed
as
close
to
the
firing
line
as
any
woman
once
the
colonel
s
wife
and
i
sitting
in
fort
samila
actually
heard
the
rifles
of
a
punitive
expedition
cracking
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
that
was
a
bad
moment
my
man
came
in
after
fifteen
hours
fighting
and
went
sound
asleep
sitting
before
his
food
with
his
knife
and
fork
in
his
hands
but
service
makes
heavy
demands
besides
those
on
your
wife
s
nerves
we
had
saved
two
thousand
rupees
i
remember
against
another
run
home
and
it
all
went
like
powder
in
the
mirzai
expedition
and
the
run
home
diminished
to
a
month
in
a
in
the
hills
meanwhile
however
we
had
begun
to
correspond
with
our
daughter
in
large
round
words
of
one
syllable
behind
which
of
course
was
plain
the
patient
guiding
hand
of
aunt
emma
one
could
hear
aunt
emma
suggesting
what
would
be
nice
to
say
trying
to
instil
a
little
pale
affection
for
the
papa
and
mamma
there
was
so
little
cecily
and
so
much
emma
of
course
it
could
not
be
otherwise
that
i
used
to
take
i
fear
but
a
perfunctory
joy
in
these
letters
when
we
went
home
again
i
stipulated
absolutely
that
she
was
to
write
to
us
without
any
sort
of
supervision
the
child
was
ten
but
the
spelling
cried
aunt
emma
with
lifted
eyebrows
her
letters
aren
t
exercises
i
was
obliged
to
retort
she
will
do
the
best
she
we
found
her
a
docile
little
girl
with
nice
manners
a
thoroughly
unobjectionable
child
i
saw
quite
clearly
that
i
could
not
have
brought
her
up
so
well
indeed
there
were
moments
when
i
fancied
that
cecily
contrasting
me
with
her
aunts
wondered
a
little
what
my
bringing
up
could
have
been
like
with
this
reserve
of
criticism
on
cecily
s
part
however
we
got
on
very
tolerably
largely
because
i
found
it
impossible
to
assume
any
responsibility
towards
her
and
in
moments
of
doubt
or
discipline
referred
her
to
her
aunts
we
spent
a
pleasant
summer
with
a
little
girl
in
the
house
whose
interest
in
us
was
amusing
and
whose
outings
it
was
gratifying
to
arrange
but
when
we
went
back
i
had
no
desire
to
take
her
with
us
i
thought
her
very
much
better
where
she
was
then
came
the
period
which
is
filled
in
a
subordinate
degree
with
cecily
s
letters
i
do
not
wish
to
claim
more
than
i
ought
they
were
not
my
only
or
even
my
principal
interest
in
life
it
was
a
long
period
it
lasted
till
she
was
john
had
had
promotion
in
the
meantime
and
there
was
rather
more
money
but
he
had
earned
his
second
brevet
with
a
bullet
through
one
lung
and
the
doctors
ordered
our
leave
to
be
spent
in
south
africa
we
had
photographs
we
knew
she
had
grown
tall
and
athletic
and
comely
and
the
letters
were
always
very
creditable
i
had
the
unusual
and
qualified
privilege
of
watching
my
daughter
s
development
from
ten
to
at
a
distance
of
four
thousand
miles
by
means
of
the
written
word
i
wrote
myself
as
provocatively
as
possible
i
sought
for
every
string
but
the
vibration
that
came
back
across
the
seas
to
me
was
always
other
than
the
one
i
looked
for
and
sometimes
there
was
none
nevertheless
farnham
wrote
me
that
cecily
very
much
valued
my
communications
once
when
i
had
described
an
unusual
excursion
in
a
native
state
i
learned
that
she
had
read
my
letter
aloud
to
the
sewing
circle
after
that
i
abandoned
description
and
confined
myself
to
such
intimate
personal
details
as
no
sewing
circle
could
find
amusing
the
child
s
own
letters
were
simply
a
mirror
of
the
ideas
of
the
farnham
ladies
that
must
have
been
so
it
was
not
altogether
my
jaundiced
eye
alice
and
emma
and
grandmamma
paraded
the
pages
in
turn
i
very
early
gave
up
hope
of
discoveries
in
my
daughter
though
as
much
of
the
original
as
i
could
detect
was
satisfactorily
simple
and
sturdy
i
found
little
things
to
criticize
of
course
tendencies
to
correct
and
by
return
post
i
criticized
and
corrected
but
the
distance
and
the
deliberation
seemed
to
touch
my
maxims
with
a
kind
of
arid
frivolity
and
sometimes
i
tore
them
up
one
quick
scolding
would
have
been
worth
a
sheaf
of
them
my
studied
little
phrases
could
only
inoculate
her
with
a
dislike
for
me
without
protecting
her
from
anything
under
the
sun
however
i
found
she
didn
t
dislike
me
when
john
and
i
went
home
at
last
to
bring
her
out
she
received
me
with
just
a
hint
of
kindness
perhaps
but
on
the
whole
very
well
chapter
john
was
recalled
of
course
before
the
end
of
our
furlough
which
knocked
various
things
on
the
head
but
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
one
learned
to
take
with
philosophy
in
any
lengthened
term
of
her
majesty
s
service
besides
there
is
usually
sugar
for
the
pill
and
in
this
case
it
was
a
staff
command
bigger
than
anything
we
expected
for
at
least
five
years
to
come
the
excitement
of
it
when
it
was
explained
to
her
gave
cecily
a
charming
colour
she
took
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
the
general
her
papa
i
think
she
had
an
idea
that
his
distinction
would
alleviate
the
situation
in
india
however
it
might
present
itself
she
accepted
that
prospective
situation
calmly
it
had
been
placed
before
her
all
her
life
there
would
always
be
a
time
when
she
should
go
and
live
with
papa
and
mamma
in
india
and
so
long
as
she
was
of
an
age
to
receive
the
idea
with
rebel
tears
she
was
assured
that
papa
and
mamma
would
give
her
a
pony
the
pony
was
no
longer
added
to
the
prospect
it
was
absorbed
no
doubt
in
the
general
list
of
attractions
calculated
to
reconcile
a
young
lady
to
a
parental
roof
with
which
she
had
no
practical
acquaintance
at
all
events
when
i
feared
the
embarrassment
and
dismay
of
a
pathetic
parting
with
darling
grandmamma
and
the
aunties
and
the
sweet
cat
and
the
dear
vicar
and
all
the
other
objects
of
affection
i
found
an
agreeable
unexpected
philosophy
i
may
add
that
while
i
anticipated
such
farewells
i
was
quite
prepared
to
take
them
easily
time
i
imagined
had
brought
philosophy
to
me
also
equally
agreeable
and
equally
unexpected
it
was
a
bombay
ship
full
of
returning
i
looked
up
and
down
the
long
saloon
tables
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
of
solace
i
was
again
among
my
own
people
they
belonged
to
bengal
and
to
burma
to
madras
and
to
the
punjab
but
they
were
all
my
people
i
could
pick
out
a
score
that
i
knew
in
fact
and
there
were
none
that
in
imagination
i
didn
t
know
the
look
of
wider
seas
and
skies
the
casual
experienced
glance
the
touch
of
irony
and
of
tolerance
how
well
i
knew
it
and
how
well
i
liked
it
dear
old
england
sitting
in
our
wake
seemed
to
hold
by
comparison
a
great
many
soft
unsophisticated
people
immensely
occupied
about
very
particular
trifles
how
difficult
it
had
been
all
the
summer
to
be
interested
these
of
my
long
acquaintance
belonged
to
my
country
s
executive
acute
alert
with
the
marks
of
travail
on
them
gladly
i
went
in
and
out
of
the
women
s
cabins
and
listened
to
the
argot
of
the
men
my
own
ruling
administering
soldiering
little
lot
cecily
looked
at
them
askance
to
her
the
atmosphere
was
alien
and
i
perceived
that
gently
and
privately
she
registered
objections
she
cast
a
disapproving
eye
upon
the
wife
of
a
conservator
of
forests
who
scanned
with
interest
a
distant
funnel
and
laid
a
small
wager
that
it
belonged
to
the
messageries
maritimes
she
looked
with
a
straightened
lip
at
the
crisply
stepping
women
who
walked
the
deck
in
short
and
rather
shabby
skirts
with
their
hands
in
their
talking
transfers
and
promotions
and
having
got
up
at
six
to
make
a
sketch
of
the
sunrise
she
came
to
me
in
profound
indignation
to
say
that
she
had
met
a
man
in
his
pyjamas
no
doubt
poor
wretch
on
his
way
to
be
shaved
i
was
unable
to
convince
her
he
was
not
expected
to
visit
the
barber
in
all
his
clothes
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
she
told
me
that
she
wished
these
people
wouldn
t
talk
to
her
she
didn
t
like
them
i
had
turned
in
the
hour
we
left
the
channel
and
had
not
left
my
berth
since
so
possibly
i
was
not
in
the
most
amiable
mood
to
receive
a
douche
of
cold
water
i
must
try
to
remember
dear
i
said
that
you
have
been
brought
up
altogether
in
the
society
of
pussies
and
vicars
and
elderly
ladies
and
of
course
you
miss
them
but
you
must
have
a
little
patience
i
shall
be
up
tomorrow
if
this
beastly
sea
continues
to
go
down
and
then
we
will
try
to
find
somebody
suitable
to
introduce
to
thank
you
mamma
said
my
daughter
without
a
ray
of
suspicion
then
she
added
consideringly
aunt
emma
and
aunt
alice
do
seem
quite
elderly
ladies
beside
you
and
yet
you
are
older
than
either
of
them
aren
t
you
i
wonder
how
that
it
was
so
innocent
so
admirable
that
i
laughed
at
my
own
expense
while
cecily
doing
her
hair
considered
me
gravely
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
why
you
laugh
mamma
quoth
she
you
laugh
so
we
had
not
to
wait
after
all
for
my
good
offices
of
the
next
morning
cecily
came
down
at
ten
o
clock
that
night
quite
happy
and
excited
she
had
been
talking
to
a
bishop
such
a
dear
bishop
the
bishop
had
been
showing
her
his
collection
of
photographs
and
she
had
promised
to
play
the
harmonium
for
him
at
the
clock
service
in
the
morning
bless
me
said
i
is
it
sunday
it
seemed
she
had
got
on
very
well
indeed
with
the
bishop
who
knew
the
married
sister
at
tunbridge
of
her
very
greatest
friend
cecily
herself
did
not
know
the
married
sister
but
that
didn
t
matter
it
was
a
link
the
bishop
was
charming
well
my
love
said
i
i
was
teaching
myself
to
use
these
forms
of
address
for
fear
she
would
feel
an
unkind
lack
of
them
but
it
was
difficult
i
am
glad
that
somebody
from
my
part
of
the
world
has
impressed
you
favourably
at
last
i
wish
we
had
more
oh
but
my
bishop
doesn
t
belong
to
your
part
of
the
world
responded
my
daughter
sleepily
he
is
travelling
for
his
it
was
the
most
unexpected
and
delightful
thing
to
be
packed
into
one
s
chair
next
morning
by
dacres
tottenham
as
i
emerged
from
the
music
saloon
after
breakfast
cecily
had
stayed
below
to
look
over
her
hymns
and
consider
with
her
bishop
the
possibility
of
an
anthem
dacres
s
face
was
the
first
i
saw
it
simply
illuminated
for
me
that
portion
of
the
deck
i
noticed
with
pleasure
the
quick
toss
of
the
cigar
overboard
as
he
recognized
and
bore
down
upon
me
we
were
immense
friends
john
liked
him
too
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
make
a
tremendous
difference
in
all
our
three
hundred
passengers
there
could
be
no
one
like
him
certainly
no
one
whom
i
could
be
more
glad
to
see
we
plunged
at
once
into
immediate
personal
affairs
we
would
get
at
the
heart
of
them
later
he
gave
his
vivid
word
to
everything
he
had
seen
and
done
we
laughed
and
exclaimed
and
were
silent
in
a
concert
of
admirable
understanding
we
were
still
unravelling
still
demanding
and
explaining
when
the
ship
s
bell
began
to
ring
for
church
and
almost
simultaneously
cecily
advanced
towards
us
she
had
a
proper
sunday
hat
on
with
flowers
under
the
brim
and
a
frock
she
wore
gloves
and
clasped
a
most
of
the
women
who
filed
past
to
the
summons
of
the
bell
were
going
down
as
they
were
in
cotton
blouses
and
serge
skirts
in
tweed
caps
or
anything
as
to
a
kind
of
family
prayers
i
knew
exactly
how
they
would
lean
against
the
pillars
of
the
saloon
during
the
psalms
this
young
lady
would
be
little
less
than
a
rebuke
to
them
i
surveyed
her
approach
she
positively
walked
as
if
it
were
sunday
my
dear
i
said
how
endimanchee
you
look
the
bishop
will
be
very
pleased
with
you
this
gentleman
is
tottenham
who
administers
her
majesty
s
pleasure
in
parts
of
india
about
allahabad
my
daughter
she
was
certainly
looking
very
fresh
and
her
calm
grey
eyes
had
the
repose
in
them
that
has
never
known
itself
to
be
disturbed
about
anything
i
wondered
whether
she
bowed
so
distantly
also
because
it
was
sunday
and
then
i
remembered
that
dacres
was
a
young
man
and
that
the
farnham
ladies
had
probably
taught
her
that
it
was
right
to
be
very
distant
with
young
men
it
is
almost
eleven
yes
dear
i
see
you
are
going
to
are
you
not
coming
mamma
i
was
well
wrapped
up
in
an
extremely
comfortable
corner
i
had
la
duchesse
bleue
uncut
in
my
lap
and
an
agreeable
person
to
talk
to
i
fear
that
in
any
case
i
should
not
been
inclined
to
attend
the
service
but
there
was
something
in
my
daughter
s
intonation
that
made
me
distinctly
hostile
to
the
idea
i
am
putting
things
down
as
they
were
extenuating
nothing
i
think
not
i
ve
turned
up
two
such
nice
stay
miss
farnham
and
keep
us
in
countenance
said
dacres
with
his
charming
smile
the
smile
displaced
a
look
of
discreet
and
amused
observation
dacres
had
an
eye
always
for
a
situation
and
this
one
was
even
newer
to
him
than
to
me
no
no
she
must
run
away
and
not
bully
her
mamma
i
said
when
she
comes
back
we
will
see
how
much
she
remembers
of
the
sermon
and
as
the
flat
tinkle
from
the
companion
began
to
show
signs
of
diminishing
cecily
with
one
grieved
glance
hastened
down
you
amazing
lady
said
dacres
a
daughter
and
such
a
tall
daughter
i
somehow
never
you
knew
we
had
one
there
was
theory
of
that
kind
i
remember
about
ten
years
ago
since
then
excuse
me
i
don
t
think
you
ve
mentioned
you
talk
as
if
she
were
a
skeleton
in
the
closet
you
didn
t
talk
as
if
she
i
think
she
was
in
a
way
poor
child
but
the
resurrection
day
hasn
t
confounded
me
as
i
deserved
she
s
a
very
good
if
you
had
asked
me
to
pick
out
your
daughter
she
would
have
been
the
last
you
would
indicate
quite
so
i
said
she
is
like
her
father
s
people
i
can
t
help
i
shouldn
t
think
you
would
if
you
could
dacres
remarked
absently
but
the
sea
air
perhaps
enabled
me
to
digest
his
thoughtlessness
with
a
smile
no
i
said
i
am
just
as
well
pleased
i
think
a
resemblance
to
me
would
confuse
me
there
was
a
trace
of
scrutiny
in
dacres
s
glance
don
t
you
find
yourself
in
sympathy
with
her
he
asked
my
dear
boy
i
have
seen
her
just
twice
in
years
you
see
i
ve
always
stuck
to
but
between
mother
and
daughter
i
may
be
but
i
had
an
idea
that
there
was
an
instinct
that
might
be
depended
i
am
depending
on
it
i
said
and
let
my
eyes
follow
the
little
blue
waves
that
chased
past
the
we
are
making
very
good
speed
aren
t
we
knots
since
last
night
at
ten
are
you
in
the
sweep
i
never
bet
on
the
way
out
can
t
afford
it
am
i
he
insisted
probably
men
are
very
slow
in
changing
their
philosophy
about
women
i
fancy
their
idea
of
the
maternal
relation
is
firmest
fixed
of
we
see
it
a
beatitude
he
cried
i
know
i
said
wearily
and
you
never
modify
the
dacres
contemplated
the
portion
of
the
deck
that
lay
between
us
his
eyes
were
discreetly
lowered
but
i
saw
embarrassment
and
speculation
and
a
hint
of
criticism
in
them
tell
me
more
about
it
said
he
oh
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
be
sympathetic
i
exclaimed
lend
me
a
little
philosophy
instead
there
is
nothing
to
tell
there
she
is
and
there
i
am
in
the
most
intimate
relation
in
the
world
constituted
when
she
is
and
i
am
dacres
started
slightly
at
the
ominous
word
so
little
do
men
realize
that
the
women
they
like
can
ever
pass
out
of
the
constated
years
of
attraction
i
find
the
young
lady
very
tolerable
very
creditable
very
nice
i
find
the
relation
atrocious
there
you
have
it
i
would
like
to
break
the
relation
into
pieces
i
went
on
recklessly
and
throw
it
into
the
sea
such
things
should
be
tempered
to
one
i
should
feel
it
much
less
if
she
occupied
another
cabin
and
would
consent
to
call
me
elizabeth
or
jane
it
is
not
as
if
i
had
been
her
mother
always
one
grows
fastidious
at
forty
new
intimacies
are
only
possible
then
on
a
basis
of
temperament
i
paused
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
making
excuses
and
i
had
not
the
least
desire
in
the
world
to
do
that
how
awfully
rough
on
the
girl
said
dacres
tottenham
that
consideration
has
also
occurred
to
me
i
said
candidly
though
i
have
perhaps
been
even
more
struck
by
its
you
had
no
earthly
business
to
be
her
mother
said
my
friend
with
irritation
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
what
would
you
have
done
and
opened
la
duchesse
bleue
chapter
morgan
wife
of
a
judge
of
the
high
court
of
bombay
and
i
sat
amidships
on
the
cool
side
in
the
suez
canal
she
was
outlining
soiled
linen
in
on
a
green
canvas
bag
i
was
admiring
the
egyptian
sands
how
charming
said
i
is
this
solitary
desert
in
the
endless
oasis
we
are
compelled
to
cross
oasis
in
the
desert
you
mean
said
morgan
i
haven
t
noticed
any
but
i
happened
to
look
up
this
morning
as
i
was
putting
on
my
stockings
and
i
saw
through
my
the
most
lovely
i
had
been
at
school
with
morgan
more
than
twenty
years
agone
but
she
had
come
to
the
special
enjoyment
of
the
dignities
of
life
while
i
still
liked
doing
things
morgan
was
the
kind
of
person
to
make
one
realize
how
distressing
a
medium
is
middle
age
contemplating
her
precipitous
lap
to
which
conventional
attitudes
were
certainly
more
becoming
i
crossed
my
own
knees
with
energy
and
once
more
resolved
to
be
young
until
i
was
old
how
perfectly
delightful
for
you
to
be
taking
cecily
out
said
morgan
placidly
isn
t
it
i
responded
watching
the
gliding
sands
but
she
was
born
in
that
makes
her
quite
time
i
should
oh
we
couldn
t
put
it
off
any
longer
i
mean
her
father
has
such
a
horror
of
early
debuts
he
simply
would
not
hear
of
her
coming
doesn
t
want
her
to
marry
in
india
i
dare
say
the
only
one
purred
morgan
oh
i
don
t
know
it
isn
t
such
a
bad
place
i
was
brought
out
there
to
marry
and
i
married
i
ve
found
it
very
you
always
did
say
exactly
what
you
thought
helena
said
morgan
excusingly
i
haven
t
much
patience
with
people
who
bring
their
daughters
out
to
give
them
the
chance
they
never
would
have
in
england
and
then
go
about
devoutly
hoping
they
won
t
marry
in
india
i
said
i
shall
be
very
pleased
if
cecily
does
as
well
as
your
girls
have
mary
in
the
indian
civil
and
jessie
in
the
imperial
service
troops
sighed
morgan
complacently
and
both
my
dear
within
a
year
it
was
a
oh
it
must
have
been
i
said
civilly
there
was
no
use
in
bandying
words
with
emily
morgan
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
like
the
satisfaction
and
pleasure
one
takes
in
one
s
daughters
morgan
went
on
limpidly
and
one
can
be
in
such
close
sympathy
with
one
s
girls
i
have
never
regretted
having
no
dear
me
yes
to
watch
oneself
growing
up
again
call
back
the
lovely
april
of
one
s
prime
etcetera
to
read
every
thought
and
anticipate
every
wish
there
is
no
more
golden
privilege
in
life
dear
emily
such
a
direct
and
natural
avenue
for
affection
such
a
wide
field
for
interest
i
paused
lost
in
the
volume
of
my
admirable
sentiments
how
beautifully
you
talk
helena
i
wish
i
had
the
it
doesn
t
mean
very
much
i
said
truthfully
oh
i
think
it
s
everything
and
how
companionable
a
girl
is
i
quite
envy
you
this
season
having
cecily
constantly
with
you
and
taking
her
about
everywhere
something
quite
new
for
you
isn
t
it
absolutely
said
i
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
immensely
but
it
is
likely
she
will
make
her
own
friends
don
t
you
think
i
added
anxiously
hardly
the
first
season
my
girls
didn
t
i
was
practically
their
only
intimate
for
months
don
t
be
afraid
you
won
t
be
obliged
to
go
shares
in
cecily
with
anybody
for
a
good
long
while
added
morgan
kindly
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
the
muddy
water
of
the
ditch
chafed
up
from
under
us
against
its
banks
with
a
smell
that
enabled
me
to
hide
the
emotions
morgan
evoked
behind
my
handkerchief
the
pale
desert
was
pictorial
with
the
drifting
deepening
purple
shadows
of
clouds
and
in
the
midst
a
blue
glimmer
of
the
bitter
lakes
with
a
white
sail
on
them
a
little
frantic
arab
boy
ran
alongside
keeping
pace
with
the
ship
except
for
the
smell
it
was
like
a
dream
we
moved
so
quietly
on
gently
on
and
on
between
the
ridgy
clay
banks
and
the
rows
of
piles
peace
was
on
the
ship
you
could
hear
what
the
fourth
in
his
white
ducks
said
to
the
quartermaster
in
his
blue
denims
you
could
count
the
strokes
of
the
electric
bell
in
the
peace
was
on
the
ship
as
she
pushed
on
an
impertinence
through
the
sands
of
the
ages
my
eyes
wandered
along
a
in
the
deck
till
they
were
arrested
by
a
petticoat
i
knew
when
they
returned
of
their
own
accord
i
seemed
to
be
always
seeing
that
petticoat
i
think
resumed
morgan
whose
glance
had
wandered
in
the
same
direction
that
cecily
is
a
very
fine
type
of
our
english
girls
with
those
dark
grey
eyes
a
little
prominent
possibly
and
that
good
colour
it
s
rather
high
now
perhaps
but
she
will
lose
quite
enough
of
it
in
india
and
those
regular
features
she
would
make
a
splendid
britannia
do
you
know
i
fancy
she
must
have
a
great
deal
of
character
has
she
any
amount
and
all
of
it
good
i
responded
with
private
dejection
no
faults
at
all
chaffed
morgan
i
shook
my
head
nothing
i
said
sadly
that
i
can
put
my
finger
on
but
i
hope
to
discover
a
few
later
the
sun
may
bring
them
like
freckles
well
you
are
a
lucky
woman
mine
had
plenty
i
assure
you
untidiness
was
no
name
for
jessie
and
mary
i
m
sorry
to
say
that
mary
sometimes
how
lovable
of
her
cecily
s
neatness
is
a
painful
example
to
me
and
i
don
t
believe
she
would
tell
a
fib
to
save
my
tell
me
said
morgan
as
the
rang
and
she
gathered
her
occupation
into
her
who
is
that
talking
to
her
oh
an
old
friend
i
replied
easily
dacres
tottenham
a
dear
fellow
and
most
benevolent
he
is
trying
on
my
behalf
to
reconcile
her
to
the
life
she
ll
have
to
lead
in
she
won
t
need
much
reconciling
if
she
s
like
most
girls
observed
morgan
but
he
seems
to
be
trying
very
that
was
quite
the
way
i
took
it
on
my
behalf
for
several
days
when
people
have
understood
you
very
adequately
for
ten
years
you
do
not
expect
them
to
boggle
at
any
problem
you
may
present
at
the
end
of
the
decade
i
thought
dacres
was
moved
by
a
fine
sense
of
compassion
i
thought
that
with
his
admirable
perception
he
had
put
a
finger
on
the
little
comedy
of
fruitfulness
in
my
life
that
laughed
so
bitterly
at
the
tragedy
of
the
barren
woman
and
was
attempting
by
delicate
manipulation
to
make
it
easier
i
really
thought
so
then
i
observed
that
myself
had
preposterously
deceived
me
that
it
wasn
t
like
that
at
all
when
tottenham
joined
us
cecily
and
me
i
saw
that
he
listened
more
than
he
talked
with
an
ear
specially
cocked
to
register
any
small
irony
which
might
appear
in
my
remarks
to
my
daughter
naturally
he
registered
more
than
there
were
to
make
up
perhaps
for
dear
cecily
s
obviously
not
registering
any
i
could
see
too
that
he
was
suspicious
of
any
flavour
of
kindness
finally
to
avoid
the
strictures
of
his
upper
lip
which
really
dear
fellow
began
to
bore
me
i
talked
exclusively
about
the
distant
sails
and
the
red
sea
littoral
when
he
no
longer
joined
us
as
we
sat
or
walked
together
i
perceived
that
his
hostility
was
fixed
and
his
parti
pris
he
was
brimful
of
compassion
but
it
was
all
for
cecily
none
for
the
situation
or
for
me
she
would
have
marvelled
placidly
why
he
pitied
her
i
am
glad
i
can
say
that
the
primitive
man
in
him
rose
up
as
pope
of
nature
and
excommunicated
me
as
a
creature
recusant
to
her
functions
then
deliberately
dacres
undertook
an
office
of
consolation
and
i
fell
to
wondering
while
morgan
spoke
her
convictions
plainly
out
how
far
an
impulse
of
reparation
for
a
misfortune
with
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
might
carry
a
man
i
began
to
watch
the
affair
with
an
interest
which
even
to
me
seemed
queer
it
was
not
detached
but
it
was
and
of
course
on
the
side
for
which
i
seem
in
this
history
to
be
perpetually
apologizing
with
certain
limitations
it
didn
t
matter
an
atom
whom
cecily
married
so
that
he
was
sound
and
decent
with
reasonable
prospects
her
simple
requirements
and
ours
for
her
would
be
quite
met
there
was
the
ghost
of
a
consolation
in
that
one
needn
t
be
anxious
or
exacting
i
could
predict
with
a
certain
amount
of
confidence
that
in
her
first
season
she
would
probably
receive
three
or
four
proposals
any
one
of
which
she
might
accept
with
as
much
propriety
and
satisfaction
as
any
other
one
for
cecily
it
was
so
simple
prearranged
by
nature
like
her
digestion
one
could
not
see
any
logical
basis
for
difficulties
a
nice
upstanding
sapper
a
dashing
bengal
lancer
oh
i
could
think
of
half
a
dozen
types
that
would
answer
excellently
she
was
the
kind
of
young
person
and
that
was
the
summing
up
of
it
to
marry
a
type
and
be
typically
happy
i
hoped
and
expected
that
she
would
but
dacres
dacres
should
exercise
the
greatest
possible
discretion
he
was
not
a
person
who
could
throw
the
dice
indifferently
with
fate
he
could
respond
to
so
much
and
he
would
inevitably
sooner
or
later
demand
so
much
response
he
was
governed
by
a
preposterously
exacting
temperament
and
he
wore
his
nerves
outside
and
what
vision
he
had
how
he
explored
the
world
he
lived
in
and
drew
out
of
it
all
there
was
all
there
was
i
could
see
him
in
the
years
to
come
ranging
alone
the
fields
that
were
sweet
and
the
horizons
that
lifted
for
him
and
ever
returning
to
pace
the
common
dusty
mortal
road
by
the
side
of
a
purblind
wife
on
general
principles
as
a
case
to
point
at
it
would
be
a
conspicuous
pity
nor
would
it
lack
the
aspect
of
a
particular
a
personal
misfortune
dacres
was
occupied
in
quite
the
natural
normal
degree
with
his
charming
self
he
would
pass
his
misery
on
and
who
would
deserve
to
escape
it
less
than
his
i
listened
to
emily
morgan
who
gleaned
in
the
ship
more
information
about
dacres
tottenham
s
people
pay
and
prospects
than
i
had
ever
acquired
and
i
kept
an
eye
upon
the
pair
which
was
i
flattered
myself
quite
maternal
i
watched
them
without
acute
anxiety
deploring
the
threatening
destiny
but
hardly
nearer
to
it
than
one
is
in
the
stalls
to
the
stage
my
moments
of
real
concern
for
dacres
were
mingled
more
with
anger
than
with
sorrow
it
seemed
inexcusable
that
he
with
his
infallible
for
temperament
should
be
on
the
point
of
making
such
an
ass
of
himself
though
i
talk
of
the
stage
there
was
nothing
at
all
dramatic
to
reward
my
attention
mine
and
emily
morgan
s
to
my
imagination
excited
by
its
idea
of
what
dacres
tottenham
s
courtship
ought
to
be
the
attentions
he
paid
to
cecily
were
most
humdrum
he
threw
rings
into
buckets
with
her
she
was
good
at
that
and
quoits
upon
the
bull
board
he
found
her
chair
after
the
decks
were
swabbed
in
the
morning
and
established
her
in
it
he
paced
the
deck
with
her
at
convenient
times
and
seasons
they
were
humdrum
but
they
were
constant
and
cumulative
cecily
took
them
with
an
even
breath
that
perfectly
matched
there
was
hardly
anything
on
her
part
to
note
a
little
discreet
observation
of
his
comings
and
goings
eyes
scarcely
lifted
from
her
book
and
later
just
a
hint
of
proprietorship
as
the
evening
she
came
up
to
me
on
deck
our
first
night
in
the
indian
ocean
i
was
lying
in
my
long
chair
looking
at
the
thick
low
stars
and
thinking
it
was
a
long
time
since
i
had
seen
john
dearest
mamma
out
here
and
nothing
over
your
shoulders
you
are
imprudent
where
is
your
wrap
tottenham
will
you
please
fetch
mamma
s
wrap
for
her
if
mamma
so
instructs
me
he
said
audaciously
do
as
cecily
tells
you
i
laughed
and
he
went
and
did
it
while
i
by
the
light
of
a
quartermaster
s
lantern
distinctly
saw
my
daughter
blush
another
time
when
cecily
came
down
to
undress
she
bent
over
me
as
i
lay
in
the
lower
berth
with
unusual
solicitude
i
had
been
dozing
and
i
jumped
what
is
it
child
i
said
is
the
ship
on
fire
no
mamma
the
ship
is
not
on
fire
there
is
nothing
wrong
i
m
so
sorry
i
startled
you
but
tottenham
has
been
telling
me
all
about
what
you
did
for
the
soldiers
the
time
plague
broke
out
in
the
lines
at
i
think
it
was
splendid
mamma
and
so
does
oh
lord
i
groaned
good
chapter
it
remained
in
my
mind
that
little
thing
that
dacres
had
taken
the
trouble
to
tell
my
daughter
i
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
serious
and
convincing
circumstances
that
had
yet
offered
itself
to
my
consideration
dacres
was
no
longer
content
to
bring
solace
and
support
to
the
more
appealing
figure
of
the
situation
he
must
set
to
work
bless
him
to
improve
the
situation
itself
he
must
try
to
induce
miss
farnham
by
telling
her
everything
he
could
remember
to
my
credit
to
think
as
well
of
her
mother
as
possible
in
spite
of
the
strange
and
secret
blows
which
that
mother
might
be
supposed
to
sit
up
at
night
to
deliver
to
her
cecily
thought
very
well
of
me
already
indeed
with
private
reservations
as
to
my
manners
and
no
not
my
morals
i
believe
i
exceeded
her
expectations
of
what
a
perfectly
new
and
untrained
mother
would
be
likely
to
prove
it
was
my
theory
that
she
found
me
all
she
could
understand
me
to
be
the
maternal
virtues
of
the
outside
were
certainly
mine
i
put
them
on
with
care
every
morning
and
wore
them
with
patience
all
day
dacres
i
assured
myself
must
have
allowed
his
preconception
to
lead
him
absurdly
by
the
nose
not
to
see
that
the
girl
was
satisfied
that
my
impatience
my
impotence
did
not
at
all
make
her
miserable
evidently
however
he
had
created
our
relations
differently
evidently
he
had
set
himself
to
their
amelioration
there
was
portent
in
it
things
seemed
to
be
closing
in
i
bit
off
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
wooden
in
considering
whether
or
not
i
should
mention
it
in
my
letter
to
john
and
decided
that
it
would
be
better
just
perhaps
to
drop
a
hint
though
i
could
not
expect
john
to
receive
it
with
any
sort
of
perturbation
men
are
different
he
would
probably
think
tottenham
well
enough
able
to
look
after
himself
i
had
embarked
on
my
letter
there
at
the
end
of
a
of
the
saloon
when
i
saw
dacres
saunter
through
he
wore
a
very
conscious
and
elaborately
purposeless
air
and
it
jumped
with
my
mood
that
he
had
nothing
less
than
the
crisis
of
his
life
in
his
pocket
and
was
looking
for
me
as
he
advanced
towards
me
between
the
long
tables
doubt
left
me
and
alarm
assailed
me
i
m
glad
to
find
you
in
a
quiet
corner
said
he
seating
himself
and
confirmed
my
worst
anticipations
i
m
writing
to
john
i
said
and
again
applied
myself
to
my
it
is
a
trick
cecily
has
since
done
her
best
in
vain
to
cure
me
of
i
am
going
to
interrupt
you
he
said
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
you
for
some
i
like
that
i
exclaimed
derisively
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
am
very
much
charmed
with
well
i
said
i
am
not
going
to
gratify
you
by
saying
anything
against
you
don
t
deserve
her
you
i
won
t
dispute
that
but
if
you
don
t
mind
i
m
not
sure
that
i
ll
stand
being
abused
dear
i
quite
see
it
isn
t
any
use
though
one
spoke
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels
and
had
not
charity
i
continued
for
him
precisely
i
won
t
go
on
but
your
quotation
is
very
i
so
bow
down
before
her
simplicity
it
makes
a
wide
and
beautiful
margin
for
the
rest
of
her
character
she
is
a
girl
ruskin
would
have
i
wonder
said
i
he
did
seem
fond
of
the
simple
type
didn
t
he
her
mind
is
so
clear
so
transparent
the
motive
spring
of
everything
she
says
and
does
is
so
direct
don
t
you
find
you
can
most
completely
depend
upon
her
oh
yes
i
said
certainly
i
nearly
always
know
what
she
is
going
to
say
before
she
says
it
and
under
given
circumstances
i
can
tell
precisely
what
she
will
i
fancy
her
sense
of
duty
is
very
beautifully
it
is
i
said
there
is
hardly
a
day
when
i
do
not
come
in
contact
with
well
that
is
surely
a
good
thing
and
i
find
that
calm
poise
of
hers
very
i
would
not
have
believed
that
so
many
virtues
could
reside
in
one
young
lady
i
said
taking
refuge
in
flippancy
and
to
think
that
she
should
be
my
daughter
as
i
believe
you
know
that
seems
to
me
rather
a
cruel
stroke
of
destiny
oh
yes
i
know
you
have
a
constructive
imagination
dacres
you
don
t
seem
to
see
that
the
girl
is
protected
by
her
limitations
like
a
tortoise
she
lives
within
them
quite
secure
and
happy
and
content
how
determined
you
are
to
be
sorry
for
her
tottenham
looked
at
the
end
of
this
lively
exchange
as
though
he
sought
for
a
polite
way
of
conveying
to
me
that
i
rather
was
the
limited
person
he
looked
as
if
he
wished
he
could
say
things
the
first
of
them
would
be
i
saw
that
he
had
quite
a
different
conception
of
cecily
that
it
was
illuminated
by
many
trifles
nuances
of
feeling
and
expression
which
he
had
noticed
in
his
talks
with
her
whenever
they
had
skirted
the
subject
of
her
adoption
by
her
mother
he
knew
her
he
was
longing
to
say
better
than
i
did
when
it
would
have
been
natural
to
reply
that
one
could
not
hope
to
compete
in
such
a
direction
with
an
intelligent
young
man
and
we
should
at
once
have
been
upon
delicate
and
difficult
ground
so
it
was
as
well
perhaps
that
he
kept
silence
until
he
said
as
he
had
come
prepared
to
say
well
i
want
to
put
that
beyond
a
doubt
her
happiness
if
i
m
good
enough
i
want
her
please
and
i
only
hope
that
she
will
be
half
as
willing
to
come
as
you
are
likely
to
be
to
let
her
it
was
a
shock
when
it
came
plump
like
that
and
i
was
horrified
to
feel
how
completely
every
other
consideration
was
lost
for
the
instant
in
the
immense
relief
that
it
prefigured
to
be
my
whole
complete
self
again
without
the
feeling
that
a
fraction
of
me
was
masquerading
about
in
cecily
to
be
freed
at
once
or
almost
from
an
exacting
condition
and
an
impossible
ideal
oh
i
exclaimed
and
my
eyes
positively
filled
you
are
good
dacres
but
i
couldn
t
let
you
do
his
undisguised
stare
brought
me
back
to
a
sense
of
the
proportion
of
things
i
saw
that
in
the
combination
of
influences
that
had
brought
tottenham
to
the
point
of
proposing
to
marry
my
daughter
consideration
for
me
if
it
had
a
place
would
be
fantastic
inwardly
i
laughed
at
the
egotism
of
raw
nerves
that
had
conjured
it
up
even
for
an
instant
as
a
reason
for
gratitude
the
situation
was
not
so
peculiar
not
so
interesting
as
that
but
i
answered
his
stare
with
a
smile
what
i
had
said
might
very
well
stand
do
you
imagine
he
said
seeing
that
i
did
not
mean
to
amplify
it
that
i
want
to
marry
her
out
of
any
sort
of
goodness
benevolence
is
your
weakness
i
see
you
think
one
s
motive
is
to
withdraw
her
from
a
relation
which
ought
to
be
the
most
natural
in
the
world
but
which
is
in
her
particular
and
painful
case
the
most
well
come
i
remonstrated
you
have
dropped
one
or
two
things
you
know
in
the
heat
of
your
indignation
not
badly
calculated
to
give
one
that
idea
the
eloquent
statement
you
have
just
made
for
instance
it
carries
all
the
patness
of
old
conviction
how
often
have
you
rehearsed
it
i
am
a
fairly
person
but
i
began
to
feel
a
little
annoyed
with
my
if
the
relation
were
achieved
it
would
give
him
no
prescriptive
right
to
bully
me
and
we
were
still
in
very
early
anticipation
of
that
ah
he
said
disarmingly
don
t
let
us
quarrel
i
m
sorry
you
think
that
because
it
isn
t
likely
to
bring
your
favour
to
my
project
and
i
want
you
friendly
and
helpful
oh
confound
it
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
temper
you
ought
to
be
i
don
t
understand
this
aloofness
i
half
suspect
it
s
pose
you
undervalue
cecily
well
you
have
no
business
to
undervalue
me
you
know
me
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
now
are
you
going
to
help
me
to
marry
your
daughter
i
don
t
think
so
i
said
slowly
after
a
moment
s
silence
which
he
sat
through
like
a
mutinous
schoolboy
i
might
tell
you
that
i
don
t
care
a
button
whom
you
marry
but
that
would
not
be
true
i
do
care
more
or
less
as
you
say
i
know
you
pretty
well
i
d
a
little
rather
you
didn
t
make
a
mess
of
it
and
if
you
must
i
should
distinctly
prefer
not
to
have
the
spectacle
under
my
nose
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
can
t
hinder
you
but
i
won
t
help
and
what
possesses
you
to
imagine
that
in
marrying
cecily
i
should
make
a
mess
of
it
shouldn
t
your
first
consideration
be
whether
she
would
perhaps
it
should
but
you
see
it
isn
t
cecily
would
be
happy
with
anybody
who
made
her
comfortable
you
would
ask
a
good
deal
more
than
that
you
dacres
at
this
took
me
up
promptly
life
he
said
the
heart
of
life
had
particularly
little
to
say
to
temperament
by
the
heart
of
life
i
suppose
he
meant
married
love
he
explained
that
its
roots
asked
other
sustenance
and
that
it
throve
best
of
all
on
simple
elemental
goodness
so
long
as
a
man
sought
in
women
mere
casual
companionship
perhaps
the
most
exquisite
thing
to
be
experienced
was
the
stimulus
of
some
spiritual
feminine
counterpart
but
when
he
desired
of
one
woman
that
she
should
be
always
and
intimately
with
him
the
background
of
his
life
the
mother
of
his
children
he
was
better
advised
to
avoid
nerves
and
sensibilities
and
try
for
the
repose
of
the
common
the
uncommon
domestic
virtues
ah
he
said
they
were
sweet
like
lavender
already
i
told
him
he
smelled
the
housekeeper
s
but
i
did
not
interrupt
him
much
i
couldn
t
he
was
too
absorbed
to
temperamental
pairing
he
declared
the
century
owed
its
breed
of
decadents
i
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
really
recognized
one
and
he
retorted
that
if
he
hadn
t
he
didn
t
wish
to
make
a
beginning
in
his
own
family
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
repudiated
the
theories
of
a
lifetime
a
gratifying
triumph
for
simple
elemental
goodness
having
denied
the
value
of
the
subtler
pretensions
to
charm
in
woman
as
you
marry
her
he
went
artlessly
on
to
endow
cecily
with
as
many
of
them
as
could
possibly
be
desirable
he
actually
persuaded
himself
to
say
that
it
was
lovely
to
see
the
reflections
of
life
in
her
tranquil
spirit
and
when
i
looked
at
him
incredulously
he
grew
angry
and
hinted
that
cecily
s
sensitiveness
to
reflections
and
other
things
might
be
a
trifle
beyond
her
mother
s
ken
she
responds
instantly
intimately
to
the
beautiful
everywhere
he
declared
aren
t
the
opportunities
of
life
on
board
ship
rather
limited
to
demonstrate
that
i
inquired
i
know
you
mean
sunsets
cecily
is
very
fond
of
sunsets
she
is
always
asking
me
to
come
and
look
at
i
was
thinking
of
last
night
s
sunset
he
confessed
we
looked
at
it
what
did
she
say
i
asked
idly
nothing
very
much
that
s
just
the
point
another
girl
would
have
raved
and
oh
well
cecily
never
does
that
i
responded
nevertheless
she
is
a
very
ordinary
human
instrument
i
hope
i
shall
have
no
temptation
ten
years
hence
to
remind
you
that
i
warned
you
of
her
i
wish
not
in
the
least
for
my
own
profit
for
i
am
well
convinced
already
but
simply
to
win
your
cordiality
and
your
approval
never
did
an
unexceptional
wooer
receive
such
niggard
encouragement
i
wish
there
were
some
sort
of
test
for
her
quality
i
would
be
proud
to
stand
by
it
and
you
would
be
convinced
i
can
t
find
words
to
describe
my
objection
to
your
state
of
the
thing
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
foregone
conclusion
i
saw
it
accomplished
with
all
its
possibilities
of
disastrous
commonplace
i
saw
all
that
i
have
here
taken
the
trouble
to
foreshadow
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
dacres
s
burden
would
add
itself
to
my
philosophies
voila
tout
i
should
always
be
a
little
uncomfortable
about
it
because
it
had
been
taken
from
my
back
but
it
would
not
be
a
matter
for
the
wringing
of
hands
and
yet
the
hatefulness
of
the
mistake
dacres
s
bold
talk
of
a
test
made
no
suggestion
should
my
invention
be
more
fertile
i
thought
of
something
you
have
said
nothing
to
her
yet
i
asked
nothing
i
don
t
think
she
suspects
for
a
moment
she
treats
me
as
if
no
such
fell
design
were
possible
i
m
none
too
confident
you
know
he
added
with
longer
face
we
go
straight
to
agra
could
you
come
to
agra
ideal
he
cried
the
memory
of
mumtaz
the
garden
of
the
taj
i
ve
always
wanted
to
love
under
the
same
moon
as
shah
jehan
how
thoughtful
of
you
you
must
spend
a
few
days
with
us
in
agra
i
continued
and
as
you
say
it
is
the
very
place
to
shrine
your
happiness
if
it
comes
to
pass
well
i
am
glad
to
have
extracted
a
word
of
kindness
from
you
at
last
said
dacres
as
the
stewards
came
to
lay
the
table
but
i
wish
he
added
regretfully
you
could
have
thought
of
a
chapter
four
days
later
we
were
in
agra
a
time
there
was
when
the
name
would
have
been
the
key
of
dreams
to
me
now
it
stood
for
john
s
headquarters
i
was
rejoiced
to
think
i
would
look
again
upon
the
taj
and
the
prospect
of
living
with
it
was
a
real
enchantment
but
i
pondered
most
the
kind
of
house
that
would
be
provided
for
the
general
commanding
the
district
how
many
the
would
seat
and
whether
it
would
have
a
roof
of
thatch
or
of
corrugated
iron
i
prayed
against
corrugated
iron
i
confess
these
my
preoccupations
i
was
forty
and
at
forty
the
practical
considerations
of
life
hold
their
own
even
against
domes
of
marble
and
set
about
with
gardens
where
the
bulbul
sings
to
the
rose
i
smiled
across
the
years
at
the
raptures
of
my
first
vision
of
the
place
at
just
cecily
s
age
would
i
now
sit
under
arjamand
s
cypresses
till
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
see
the
wonder
of
her
tomb
at
a
particular
angle
of
the
moon
would
i
climb
one
of
her
tall
white
ministering
minarets
to
see
anything
whatever
i
very
greatly
feared
that
i
would
not
alas
for
the
aging
of
sentiment
of
interest
keep
your
touch
with
life
and
your
seat
in
the
saddle
as
long
as
you
will
the
world
is
no
new
toy
at
forty
but
cecily
was
cecily
who
sat
stolidly
finishing
her
lunch
while
dacres
tottenham
talked
about
akbar
and
his
philosophy
the
sort
of
man
he
said
that
carlyle
might
have
smoked
a
pipe
but
surely
said
cecily
reflectively
tobacco
was
not
discovered
in
england
then
akbar
came
to
the
throne
in
nor
carlyle
either
for
that
matter
i
hastened
to
observe
nevertheless
i
think
tottenham
s
proposition
must
thanks
farnham
said
dacres
but
imagine
miss
farnham
s
remembering
akbar
s
date
i
m
sure
you
didn
t
let
us
hope
she
doesn
t
know
too
much
about
him
i
cried
gaily
or
there
will
be
nothing
to
tell
oh
really
and
truly
very
little
said
cecily
but
as
soon
as
we
heard
papa
would
be
stationed
here
aunt
emma
made
me
read
up
about
those
old
moguls
and
people
i
think
i
remember
the
dynasty
baber
wasn
t
he
the
first
and
then
humayon
and
after
him
akbar
and
then
jehangir
and
then
shah
jehan
but
i
ve
forgotten
every
date
but
akbar
she
smiled
her
smile
of
brilliant
health
and
even
spirits
as
she
made
the
damaging
admission
and
she
was
so
good
to
look
at
sitting
there
simple
and
wholesome
and
fresh
peeling
her
banana
with
her
fingers
that
we
swallowed
the
dynasty
as
it
were
whole
and
smiled
back
upon
her
john
i
may
say
was
extremely
pleased
with
cecily
he
said
she
was
a
very
satisfactory
human
accomplishment
one
would
have
thought
positively
the
way
he
plumed
himself
over
his
handsome
daughter
that
he
alone
was
responsible
for
her
but
john
having
received
his
family
straightway
set
off
with
his
staff
on
a
tour
of
inspection
and
thereby
takes
himself
out
of
this
history
i
sometimes
think
that
if
he
had
stayed
but
there
has
never
been
the
lightest
recrimination
between
us
about
it
and
i
am
not
going
to
hint
one
now
did
you
read
asked
dacres
what
he
and
the
court
poet
wrote
over
the
entrance
gate
to
the
big
mosque
at
it
s
rather
nice
the
world
is
a
wherein
the
image
has
come
and
is
gone
take
as
thine
own
nothing
more
than
what
thou
lookest
my
daughter
s
thoughtful
gaze
was
of
course
fixed
upon
the
speaker
and
in
his
own
glance
i
saw
a
sudden
ray
of
consciousness
but
cecily
transferred
her
eyes
to
the
opposite
wall
deeply
considering
and
while
dacres
and
i
smiled
across
the
table
i
saw
that
she
had
perceived
no
reason
for
blushing
it
was
a
singularly
narrow
escape
no
she
said
i
didn
t
what
a
curious
proverb
for
an
emperor
to
make
he
couldn
t
possibly
have
been
able
to
see
all
his
possessions
at
if
you
have
finished
dacres
addressed
her
do
let
me
show
you
what
your
plain
and
immediate
duty
is
to
the
garden
the
garden
waits
for
you
all
the
roses
expectant
why
there
isn
t
one
cried
cecily
pinning
on
her
hat
it
was
pleasing
and
just
a
trifle
pathetic
the
way
he
hurried
her
out
of
the
scope
of
any
little
dart
he
would
not
have
her
even
within
range
of
amused
observation
would
he
continue
i
wondered
vaguely
as
with
my
elbows
on
the
table
i
tore
into
strips
the
that
floated
in
my
would
he
continue
through
life
to
shelter
her
from
his
other
clever
friends
as
now
he
attempted
to
shelter
her
from
her
mother
in
that
case
he
would
have
to
domicile
her
poor
dear
behind
the
curtain
like
the
native
ladies
a
good
price
to
pay
for
a
protection
of
which
bless
her
heart
she
would
be
all
unaware
i
had
quite
stopped
bemoaning
the
affair
perhaps
the
comments
of
my
husband
who
treated
it
with
broad
approval
and
satisfaction
did
something
to
soothe
my
sensibilities
at
all
events
i
had
gradually
come
to
occupy
a
high
fatalistic
ground
towards
the
pair
if
it
was
written
upon
their
foreheads
that
they
should
marry
the
inscription
was
none
of
mine
and
of
course
it
was
true
as
john
had
indignantly
stated
that
dacres
might
do
very
much
worse
one
s
interest
in
dacres
tottenham
s
problematical
future
had
in
no
way
diminished
but
the
young
man
was
so
positive
so
full
of
intention
so
disinclined
to
discussion
he
had
not
reopened
the
subject
since
that
morning
in
the
saloon
of
the
caledonia
that
one
s
feeling
about
it
rather
took
the
attenuated
form
of
a
shrug
i
am
afraid
too
that
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
such
an
impending
event
had
a
little
supervened
even
at
forty
there
is
no
disallowing
the
natural
interests
of
one
s
sex
as
i
sat
there
pulling
my
to
pieces
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
or
in
the
least
put
about
if
the
two
had
returned
radiant
from
the
lawn
to
demand
my
blessing
as
to
the
test
of
quality
that
i
had
obligingly
invented
for
dacres
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
without
his
knowledge
or
connivance
it
had
some
time
ago
faded
into
what
he
apprehended
it
to
be
a
mere
idyllic
opportunity
a
charming
background
a
frame
for
his
project
of
prettier
sentiment
than
the
funnels
and
the
of
a
ship
tottenham
had
ten
days
to
spend
with
us
he
knew
the
place
well
it
belonged
to
the
province
to
whose
service
he
was
dedicated
and
he
claimed
with
impressive
authority
the
privilege
of
showing
it
to
cecily
by
degrees
the
hall
of
audience
today
the
jessamine
tower
tomorrow
the
tomb
of
akbar
another
and
the
deserted
city
yet
another
day
we
arranged
the
expeditions
in
conference
dacres
insisting
only
upon
the
order
of
them
which
i
saw
was
to
be
cumulative
with
the
taj
at
the
very
end
on
the
night
precisely
of
the
full
of
the
moon
with
a
better
chance
of
roses
i
had
no
special
views
but
cecily
contributed
some
that
we
should
do
the
hall
of
audience
in
the
morning
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
club
tennis
in
the
afternoon
that
we
should
bicycle
to
akbar
s
tomb
and
take
a
cold
luncheon
if
we
were
sure
there
would
be
no
snakes
to
the
deserted
city
to
all
of
which
dacres
gave
loyal
assent
i
endorsed
everything
i
was
the
encouraging
chorus
only
stipulating
that
my
number
should
be
swelled
from
day
to
day
by
the
addition
of
such
persons
as
i
should
approve
cecily
for
instance
wanted
to
invite
the
bakewells
because
we
had
come
out
in
the
same
ship
with
them
but
i
could
not
endure
the
bakewells
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
having
made
the
voyage
with
them
was
the
best
possible
reason
for
declining
to
lay
eyes
on
them
for
the
rest
of
our
natural
lives
mamma
has
such
strong
prejudices
cecily
remarked
as
she
reluctantly
gave
up
the
idea
and
i
waited
to
see
whether
the
graceless
tottenham
would
unmurmuringly
take
down
the
bakewells
how
strong
must
be
the
sentiment
that
turns
a
man
into
a
without
a
pang
of
transmigration
but
no
this
time
he
was
faithful
to
the
principles
of
his
existence
they
are
rather
boojums
he
declared
you
would
think
so
too
if
you
knew
them
better
it
is
that
kind
of
excellent
person
that
makes
the
real
burden
of
i
could
have
patted
him
on
the
back
thanks
to
the
rest
of
the
chorus
which
proved
abundantly
available
i
was
no
immediate
witness
to
cecily
s
introduction
to
the
glorious
fragments
which
sustain
in
agra
the
memory
of
the
moguls
i
may
as
well
say
that
i
arranged
with
care
that
if
anybody
must
be
standing
by
when
dacres
disclosed
them
it
should
not
be
i
if
cecily
had
squinted
i
should
have
been
sorry
but
i
would
have
found
in
it
no
personal
humiliation
there
were
other
imperfections
of
vision
however
for
which
i
felt
responsible
and
ashamed
and
with
dacres
though
the
situation
heaven
knows
was
none
of
my
seeking
i
had
a
little
the
feeling
of
a
dealer
who
offers
a
defective
bibelot
to
a
connoisseur
my
charming
daughter
i
was
fifty
times
congratulated
upon
her
appearance
and
her
manners
had
many
excellent
qualities
and
capacities
which
she
never
inherited
from
me
but
she
could
see
no
more
than
the
bulk
no
further
than
the
perspective
she
could
register
exactly
as
much
as
a
camera
this
was
a
curious
thing
perhaps
to
displease
my
maternal
vanity
but
it
did
i
had
really
rather
she
squinted
and
when
there
was
anything
to
look
at
i
kept
out
of
the
way
i
can
not
tell
precisely
therefore
what
the
incidents
were
that
contributed
to
make
tottenham
on
our
return
from
these
expeditions
so
thoughtful
with
a
thoughtfulness
which
increased
towards
the
end
of
them
to
a
positive
gravity
this
would
disappear
during
dinner
under
the
influence
of
food
and
drink
he
would
talk
nightly
with
new
enthusiasm
and
fresh
hope
or
did
i
imagine
it
of
the
loveliness
he
had
arranged
to
reveal
on
the
following
day
if
again
my
imagination
did
not
lead
me
astray
i
fancied
this
occurred
later
and
later
in
the
course
of
the
meal
as
the
week
went
on
as
if
his
state
required
more
stimulus
as
time
progressed
one
evening
when
i
expected
it
to
flag
altogether
i
had
a
whim
to
order
champagne
and
observe
the
effect
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
reproved
myself
and
refrained
cecily
meanwhile
was
conducting
herself
in
a
manner
which
left
nothing
to
be
desired
if
as
i
sometimes
thought
she
took
dacres
very
much
for
granted
she
took
him
calmly
for
granted
she
seemed
a
prey
to
none
of
those
fluttering
uncertainties
those
suspended
judgments
and
elaborate
indifferences
which
translate
themselves
so
plainly
in
a
young
lady
receiving
addresses
she
turned
herself
out
very
freshly
and
very
well
she
was
always
ready
for
everything
and
i
am
sure
that
no
glance
of
dacres
tottenham
s
found
aught
but
direct
and
decorous
response
his
society
on
these
occasions
gave
her
solid
pleasure
so
did
the
drive
and
the
lunch
the
satisfactions
were
apparently
upon
the
same
plane
she
was
aware
of
the
plum
if
i
may
be
permitted
a
brusque
but
irresistible
simile
and
with
her
mouth
open
her
eyes
modestly
closed
and
her
head
in
a
convenient
position
she
waited
placidly
until
it
should
fall
in
the
farnham
ladies
would
have
been
delighted
with
the
result
of
their
labours
in
the
sweet
reason
and
eminent
propriety
of
this
attitude
thinking
of
my
idiotic
sufferings
when
john
began
to
fix
himself
upon
my
horizon
i
pondered
profoundly
the
power
of
nature
in
differentiation
one
evening
the
last
i
think
but
one
i
had
occasion
to
go
to
my
daughter
s
room
and
found
her
writing
in
her
she
had
a
as
well
as
a
where
is
it
an
an
a
diary
a
daily
sunshine
and
others
with
purposes
too
various
to
remember
dearest
mamma
she
said
as
i
was
departing
there
is
only
one
p
in
opulence
isn
t
there
yes
i
replied
with
my
hand
on
the
and
added
curiously
for
it
was
an
odd
word
in
cecily
s
mouth
why
she
hardly
hesitated
oh
she
said
i
am
just
writing
down
one
or
two
things
tottenham
said
about
agra
before
i
forget
them
they
seemed
so
he
has
a
descriptive
touch
i
remarked
i
think
he
describes
beautifully
would
you
like
to
hear
what
he
said
today
i
would
i
replied
sincerely
agra
read
this
astonishing
young
lady
is
india
s
one
pure
idyll
elsewhere
she
offers
other
things
foolish
opulence
tawdry
pageant
treachery
of
eunuchs
and
jealousies
of
harems
thefts
of
kings
jewels
and
barbaric
retributions
but
they
are
all
actual
visualized
or
part
of
a
past
that
shows
to
the
backward
glance
hardly
more
relief
and
vitality
than
a
persian
painting
i
should
like
to
see
a
persian
painting
but
here
the
immortal
tombs
and
rise
out
of
colour
delicate
and
subtle
the
vision
holds
across
three
hundred
years
the
print
of
the
court
is
still
in
the
dust
of
the
did
you
really
let
him
go
on
like
that
i
exclaimed
it
has
the
license
of
a
lecture
i
encouraged
him
to
of
course
he
didn
t
say
it
straight
off
he
said
it
naturally
he
stopped
now
and
then
to
cough
i
didn
t
understand
it
all
but
i
think
i
have
remembered
every
you
have
a
remarkable
memory
i
m
glad
he
stopped
to
cough
is
there
any
more
one
little
bit
here
the
moguls
wrought
their
passions
into
marble
and
held
them
up
with
great
refrains
from
their
religion
and
set
them
about
with
gardens
and
here
they
stand
in
the
twilight
of
the
glory
of
those
kings
and
the
noonday
splendour
of
their
how
clever
of
you
i
exclaimed
how
wonderfully
clever
of
you
to
remember
i
had
to
ask
him
to
repeat
one
or
two
sentences
he
didn
t
like
that
but
this
is
nothing
i
used
to
learn
pages
for
aunt
emma
she
was
very
particular
i
think
it
is
worth
preserving
don
t
you
dear
cecily
i
responded
you
have
a
frugal
there
was
nothing
else
to
respond
i
could
not
tell
her
just
how
practical
i
thought
her
or
how
pathetic
her
little
book
chapter
we
drove
together
after
dinner
to
the
taj
the
moonlight
lay
in
an
empty
splendour
over
the
broad
sandy
road
with
the
acacias
pricking
up
on
each
side
of
it
and
the
gardens
of
the
station
bungalows
stretching
back
into
clusters
of
crisp
shadows
it
was
an
exquisite
february
night
very
still
nothing
seemed
abroad
but
two
or
three
pariah
dogs
upon
vague
and
errant
business
and
the
executive
engineer
going
swiftly
home
from
the
club
on
his
bicycle
even
the
little
shops
of
the
bazaar
were
dark
and
empty
only
here
and
there
a
light
showed
barred
behind
the
carved
balconies
of
the
upper
rooms
and
there
was
hardly
any
the
last
long
slope
of
the
road
showed
us
the
river
curving
to
the
left
through
a
silent
white
waste
that
stretched
indefinitely
into
the
moonlight
on
one
side
and
was
crowned
by
akbar
s
fort
on
the
other
his
long
high
line
of
turrets
and
battlements
still
guarded
a
hint
of
their
evening
rose
and
dim
and
exquisite
above
them
hovered
the
three
of
the
pearl
mosque
it
was
a
night
of
perfect
illusion
and
the
illusion
was
mysterious
delicate
and
faint
i
sat
silent
as
we
rolled
along
twenty
years
nearer
to
the
original
joy
of
things
when
john
and
i
drove
through
the
same
old
dream
dacres
too
seemed
preoccupied
only
cecily
was
as
they
say
herself
cecily
was
really
more
than
herself
she
exhibited
an
unusual
flow
of
spirits
she
talked
continually
she
pointed
out
this
and
that
she
asked
who
lived
here
and
who
lived
there
at
regular
intervals
of
about
four
minutes
she
demanded
if
it
wasn
t
simply
too
lovely
she
sat
straight
up
with
her
vigorous
profile
and
her
smart
hat
and
the
silhouette
of
her
personality
sharply
refused
to
mingle
with
the
dust
of
any
dynasty
she
was
a
contrast
a
protest
positively
she
was
an
indignity
do
lean
back
dear
child
i
exclaimed
at
last
you
interfere
with
the
she
leaned
back
but
she
went
on
interfering
with
it
in
terms
of
sincerest
enthusiasm
when
we
stopped
at
the
great
archway
of
entrance
i
begged
to
be
left
in
the
carriage
what
else
could
one
do
when
the
golden
moment
had
come
but
sit
in
the
carriage
and
measure
it
they
climbed
the
broad
stone
steps
together
and
passed
under
the
lofty
gravures
into
the
garden
and
i
waited
i
waited
and
remembered
i
am
not
as
perhaps
by
this
time
is
evident
a
person
of
overwhelming
sentiment
but
i
think
the
smile
upon
my
lips
was
gentle
so
plainly
i
could
see
beyond
the
massive
archway
and
across
a
score
of
years
all
that
they
saw
at
that
moment
arjamand
s
garden
and
the
long
straight
tank
of
marble
cleaving
it
full
of
sleeping
water
and
the
shadows
of
the
marshaling
cypresses
her
wide
dark
garden
of
roses
and
of
pomegranates
and
at
the
end
the
vision
marvellous
aerial
the
soul
of
something
is
it
beauty
is
it
sorrow
that
great
white
pride
of
love
in
mourning
such
as
only
here
in
all
the
round
of
our
little
world
lifts
itself
to
the
stars
the
unpaintable
indescribable
taj
mahal
a
gentle
breath
stole
out
with
a
scent
of
jessamine
and
such
a
memory
i
closed
my
eyes
and
felt
the
warm
luxury
of
a
tear
thinking
of
the
two
in
the
garden
my
mood
was
very
kind
very
conniving
how
foolish
after
all
were
my
theories
of
taste
and
temperament
before
that
uncalculating
thing
which
sways
a
world
and
builds
a
taj
mahal
was
it
probable
that
arjamand
and
her
emperor
had
loved
fastidiously
and
yet
how
they
had
loved
i
wandered
away
into
consideration
of
the
blind
forces
which
move
the
world
in
which
comely
young
persons
like
my
daughter
cecily
had
such
a
place
i
speculated
vaguely
upon
the
value
of
the
subtler
gifts
of
sympathy
and
insight
which
seemed
indeed
at
that
enveloping
moment
to
be
mere
flowers
strewn
upon
the
tide
of
deeper
emotions
the
garden
sent
me
a
fragrance
of
roses
the
moon
sailed
higher
and
picked
out
the
little
kiosks
set
along
the
wall
it
was
a
charming
charming
thing
to
wait
there
at
the
portal
of
the
silvered
scented
garden
for
an
idyll
to
come
forth
when
they
reappeared
dacres
and
my
daughter
they
came
with
casual
steps
and
cheerful
voices
they
might
have
been
a
couple
of
tourists
the
moonlight
fell
full
upon
them
on
the
platform
under
the
arch
it
showed
dacres
measuring
with
his
stick
the
length
of
the
sanskrit
letters
which
declared
the
stately
texts
and
cecily
s
expression
of
polite
perfunctory
interest
they
looked
up
at
the
height
above
them
they
looked
back
at
the
vision
behind
then
they
sauntered
towards
the
carriage
he
offering
a
formal
hand
to
help
her
down
the
uncertain
steps
she
gracefully
accepting
it
you
you
have
not
been
long
said
i
i
hope
you
didn
t
hurry
on
my
miss
farnham
found
the
marble
a
little
cold
under
foot
replied
dacres
putting
miss
farnham
in
you
see
explained
cecily
i
stupidly
forgot
to
change
into
thicker
soles
i
have
only
my
slippers
but
mamma
how
lovely
it
is
do
let
us
come
again
in
the
daytime
i
am
dying
to
make
a
sketch
of
tottenham
was
to
leave
us
on
the
following
day
in
the
morning
after
little
breakfast
as
we
say
in
india
he
sought
me
in
the
room
i
had
set
aside
to
be
particularly
my
own
again
i
was
writing
to
john
but
this
time
i
waited
for
precisely
his
interruption
i
had
got
no
further
than
my
dearest
husband
and
my
was
a
fringe
another
fine
day
i
said
as
if
the
old
old
indian
joke
could
give
him
ease
poor
man
yes
said
he
we
are
having
lovely
he
had
forgotten
that
it
was
a
joke
then
he
lapsed
into
silence
while
i
renewed
my
attentions
to
my
pen
i
say
he
said
at
last
with
so
strained
a
look
about
his
mouth
that
it
was
almost
a
contortion
i
haven
t
done
it
you
no
i
responded
cheerfully
and
you
re
not
going
to
is
that
it
well
frankly
said
he
dear
me
yes
anything
else
between
you
and
me
would
be
grotesque
i
interrupted
after
all
these
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
a
success
he
said
looking
at
me
resolutely
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
in
which
still
lay
alas
the
possibility
of
many
delusions
no
i
said
i
never
did
you
know
but
the
prospect
had
begun
to
impose
upon
to
say
how
right
you
were
would
seem
under
the
circumstances
the
most
hateful
form
of
yes
i
said
i
think
i
can
dispense
with
your
verbal
i
felt
a
little
bitter
it
was
of
course
better
that
the
connoisseur
should
have
discovered
the
flaw
before
concluding
the
transaction
but
although
i
had
pointed
it
out
myself
i
was
not
entirely
pleased
to
have
the
article
returned
i
am
infinitely
ashamed
that
it
should
have
taken
me
all
these
days
day
after
day
and
each
contributory
to
discover
what
you
saw
so
easily
and
so
you
forget
that
i
am
her
mother
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
saying
oh
for
god
s
sake
don
t
jeer
please
be
absolutely
direct
and
tell
me
if
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
to
the
extent
of
a
thought
of
a
breath
to
any
extent
at
all
she
he
was
i
could
see
very
deeply
moved
he
had
not
arrived
at
this
point
without
trouble
and
disorder
not
lightly
to
be
put
on
or
off
yet
i
did
not
hurry
to
his
relief
i
was
still
possessed
by
a
vague
feeling
of
offense
i
reflected
that
any
mother
would
be
and
i
quite
plumed
myself
upon
my
annoyance
it
was
so
satisfactory
when
one
had
a
daughter
to
know
the
sensations
of
even
any
mother
nor
was
it
soothing
to
remember
that
the
young
man
s
whole
attitude
towards
cecily
had
been
based
upon
criticism
of
me
even
though
he
sat
before
me
whipped
with
his
own
lash
his
temerity
had
been
stupid
and
obstinate
i
could
not
regret
his
punishment
i
kept
him
waiting
long
enough
to
think
all
this
and
then
i
replied
i
have
not
the
least
means
of
i
can
not
say
what
he
expected
but
he
squared
his
shoulders
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
and
might
receive
another
then
he
looked
at
me
with
a
flash
of
the
old
indignation
you
are
not
near
enough
to
her
for
that
he
exclaimed
i
am
not
near
enough
to
her
for
silence
fell
between
us
a
crow
perched
upon
an
opened
venetian
and
cawed
lustily
for
years
afterward
i
never
heard
a
crow
caw
without
a
sense
of
vain
distressing
experiment
dacres
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
i
very
soon
put
a
stop
to
that
i
can
t
talk
to
a
pendulum
i
said
but
i
could
not
persuade
him
to
sit
down
again
candidly
he
said
at
length
do
you
think
she
would
have
me
i
regret
to
say
that
i
think
she
would
but
you
would
not
dream
of
asking
why
not
she
is
a
dear
girl
he
responded
inconsequently
you
could
not
possibly
stand
then
tottenham
delivered
himself
of
this
remarkable
phrase
i
could
stand
it
he
said
as
well
as
you
there
was
far
from
being
any
joy
in
the
irony
with
which
i
regarded
him
and
under
which
i
saw
him
gather
up
his
resolution
to
go
nevertheless
i
did
nothing
to
make
it
easy
for
him
i
refrained
from
imparting
my
private
conviction
that
cecily
would
accept
the
first
presentable
substitute
that
appeared
although
it
was
strong
i
made
no
reference
to
my
daughter
s
large
fund
of
philosophy
and
small
balance
of
sentiment
i
did
not
even
though
this
was
reprehensible
confess
the
test
the
test
of
quality
in
these
ten
days
with
the
marble
archives
of
the
moguls
which
i
had
almost
wantonly
suggested
which
he
had
so
unconsciously
accepted
so
disastrously
applied
i
gave
him
quite
fifteen
minutes
of
his
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
and
when
it
was
over
i
wrote
truthfully
but
furiously
to
john
that
was
ten
years
ago
we
have
since
attained
the
shades
of
retirement
and
our
daughter
is
still
with
us
when
she
is
not
with
aunt
emma
and
aunt
alice
grandmamma
has
passed
away
tottenham
s
dumb
departure
that
day
in
february
it
was
the
year
john
got
his
was
followed
i
am
thankful
to
say
by
none
of
the
symptoms
of
unrequited
affection
on
cecily
s
part
not
for
ten
minutes
so
far
as
i
was
aware
was
she
the
maid
forlorn
i
think
her
was
of
too
robust
a
character
thanks
to
the
misses
farnham
still
less
of
course
had
she
any
reproaches
to
serve
upon
her
mother
although
for
a
long
time
i
thought
i
detected
or
was
it
my
guilty
conscience
a
spark
of
shrewdness
in
the
glance
she
bent
upon
me
when
the
talk
was
of
tottenham
and
the
probabilities
of
his
return
to
agra
so
well
did
she
sustain
her
experience
or
so
little
did
she
feel
it
that
i
believe
the
impression
went
abroad
that
dacres
had
been
sent
disconsolate
away
one
astonishing
conversation
i
had
with
her
some
six
months
later
which
turned
upon
the
point
of
a
particularly
desirable
offer
she
told
me
something
then
without
any
sort
of
embarrassment
but
quite
lucidly
and
directly
that
edified
me
much
to
hear
she
said
that
while
she
was
quite
sure
that
tottenham
thought
of
her
only
as
a
friend
she
had
never
had
the
least
reason
for
any
other
impression
he
had
done
her
a
service
for
which
she
could
not
thank
him
enough
in
showing
her
what
a
husband
might
be
he
had
given
her
a
standard
it
might
be
high
but
it
was
unalterable
she
didn
t
know
whether
she
could
describe
it
but
tottenham
was
different
from
the
kind
of
man
you
seemed
to
meet
in
india
he
had
his
own
ways
of
looking
at
things
and
he
talked
so
well
he
had
given
her
an
ideal
and
she
intended
to
profit
by
it
to
know
that
men
like
tottenham
existed
and
to
marry
any
other
kind
would
be
an
act
of
folly
which
she
did
not
intend
to
commit
no
major
the
hon
hugh
taverel
did
not
come
near
it
very
far
short
indeed
he
had
talked
to
her
during
the
whole
of
dinner
the
night
before
about
with
a
bobbery
pack
not
at
all
an
elevated
mind
yes
he
might
be
a
very
good
fellow
but
as
a
companion
for
life
she
was
sure
he
would
not
be
at
all
suitable
she
would
wait
and
she
has
waited
i
never
thought
she
would
but
she
has
from
time
to
time
men
have
wished
to
take
her
from
us
but
the
standard
has
been
inexorable
and
none
of
them
have
reached
it
when
dacres
married
the
charming
american
whom
he
caught
like
a
butterfly
upon
her
eastern
tour
cecily
sent
them
as
a
wedding
present
an
alabaster
model
of
the
taj
and
i
let
her
do
it
the
gift
was
so
exquisitely
appropriate
i
suppose
he
never
looks
at
it
without
being
reminded
that
he
didn
t
marry
miss
farnham
and
i
hope
that
he
remembers
that
he
owes
it
to
miss
farnham
s
mother
so
much
i
think
i
might
claim
it
is
really
very
little
considering
what
it
stands
for
cecily
is
permanently
with
us
i
believe
she
considers
herself
an
intimate
i
am
very
reasonable
about
lending
her
to
her
aunts
but
she
takes
no
sort
of
advantage
of
my
liberality
she
says
she
knows
her
duty
is
at
home
she
is
growing
into
a
firm
and
solid
english
maiden
lady
with
a
good
colour
and
great
decision
of
character
that
she
always
had
i
point
out
to
john
when
she
takes
our
crumpets
away
from
us
that
she
gets
it
from
him
i
could
never
take
away
anybody
s
crumpets
merely
because
they
were
indigestible
least
of
all
my
own
parents
she
has
acquired
a
distinct
affection
for
us
by
some
means
best
known
to
herself
but
i
should
have
no
objection
to
that
if
she
would
not
rearrange
my
that
is
a
fond
liberty
to
which
i
take
exception
but
it
is
one
thing
to
take
exception
and
another
to
express
it
our
daughter
is
with
us
permanently
with
us
she
declares
that
she
intends
to
be
the
prop
of
our
declining
years
she
makes
the
statement
often
and
always
as
if
it
were
humorous
nevertheless
i
sometimes
notice
a
spirit
of
inquiry
a
note
of
investigation
in
her
encounters
with
the
opposite
sex
that
suggests
an
expectation
not
yet
extinct
that
another
and
perhaps
a
more
appreciative
dacres
tottenham
may
flash
across
her
field
of
vision
alas
how
improbable
myself
i
can
not
imagine
why
she
should
wish
it
i
have
grown
in
my
old
age
into
a
perfect
horror
of
cultivated
young
men
but
if
such
a
person
should
by
a
miracle
at
any
time
appear
i
think
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
i
will
interfere
on
his
behalf
an
impossible
ideal
chapter
to
understand
how
we
prized
him
dora
harris
and
i
it
is
necessary
to
know
simla
i
suppose
people
think
of
that
place
if
they
ever
do
think
of
it
as
an
agreeable
retreat
in
the
wilds
of
the
himalayas
where
deodars
and
scandals
grow
and
where
the
viceroy
if
he
likes
may
take
off
his
decorations
and
go
about
in
flannels
i
know
how
useless
it
would
be
to
try
to
give
a
more
faithful
impression
and
i
will
hold
back
from
the
attempt
as
far
as
i
can
besides
my
little
story
is
itself
an
explanation
of
simla
ingersoll
armour
might
have
appeared
almost
anywhere
else
without
making
social
history
he
came
and
bloomed
among
us
in
the
wilderness
and
such
and
such
things
happened
it
sounds
too
rude
a
generalization
to
say
that
simla
is
a
wilderness
i
hasten
to
add
that
it
is
a
waste
as
highly
cultivated
as
you
like
producing
many
things
more
admirable
than
ingersoll
armour
still
he
bloomed
there
conspicuously
alone
perhaps
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
tell
if
we
had
not
tried
to
gather
him
that
was
wrong
nature
in
simla
expects
you
to
be
content
with
cocked
hats
there
are
artists
almost
everywhere
and
people
who
paint
even
in
the
himalayas
though
miss
harris
and
i
in
our
superior
way
went
yearly
to
the
simla
fine
arts
exhibition
chiefly
to
amuse
ourselves
by
scoffing
it
was
easy
to
say
clever
things
about
the
poor
little
exhibits
and
one
was
grateful
to
the
show
on
this
account
for
nothing
is
more
depressing
east
of
suez
than
the
absence
of
provocation
to
say
clever
things
there
one
afternoon
in
may
as
we
marched
about
enjoying
ourselves
we
came
upon
ingersoll
armour
not
in
the
flesh
but
in
half
a
dozen
studies
hanging
in
the
least
conspicuous
corner
and
quite
the
worst
light
in
the
room
eh
what
said
i
and
dora
exclaimed
i
say
sent
out
from
home
i
said
ever
the
oracle
not
at
all
replied
dora
look
they
are
indian
subjects
simla
subjects
she
went
on
with
excitement
i
turned
up
the
catalogue
kasumti
bazaar
clouds
on
the
chor
the
house
of
a
friend
lord
what
apricot
blossoms
yes
they
re
all
for
goodness
sake
said
dora
who
painted
them
you
ve
got
the
catalogue
i
armour
i
read
i
armour
she
repeated
and
we
looked
at
each
other
saying
in
plain
silence
that
to
the
small
world
of
simla
armour
was
unknown
not
on
government
house
list
i
venture
to
believe
said
dora
that
in
itself
may
show
to
what
depths
we
sink
yet
it
was
a
trenchant
and
a
reasonable
speculation
it
may
be
a
newcomer
i
suggested
but
she
shook
her
head
all
newcomers
call
upon
us
she
said
there
in
the
middle
of
the
mall
we
escape
none
of
them
he
isn
t
a
calling
why
do
you
say
he
you
are
very
confident
with
your
pronouns
there
s
a
delicacy
of
feeling
which
exactly
does
not
suggest
a
women
we
are
undermined
by
delicacy
of
feeling
we
re
not
strong
enough
to
express
it
with
brushes
a
man
can
make
it
a
quality
a
decorative
characteristic
and
so
we
see
it
with
a
woman
it
s
everything
all
over
the
place
and
of
no
effect
oh
i
assure
you
armour
is
a
who
shall
stand
against
you
let
him
be
a
man
he
has
taste
exclaimed
miss
harris
violently
and
from
the
corners
of
her
mouth
i
gathered
that
i
had
said
one
of
those
things
which
she
would
store
up
and
produce
to
prove
that
i
was
not
for
all
my
pretensions
a
person
of
the
truest
feeling
he
sees
there
s
an
intensity
i
ventured
that
s
better
yes
an
intensity
a
perfect
passion
of
colour
look
at
she
indicated
a
patch
of
hillsides
perhaps
six
inches
by
four
in
which
the
light
seemed
to
come
and
go
as
it
does
in
a
sapphire
we
stood
and
gazed
it
was
a
tremendous
thing
only
half
a
dozen
studies
with
feeling
and
knowledge
in
them
but
there
in
that
remote
fastness
thrice
barred
against
the
arts
a
tremendous
thing
a
banquet
for
our
famished
eyes
what
they
would
have
said
to
us
in
london
is
a
different
matter
and
how
good
they
really
were
i
do
not
find
the
courage
to
pronounce
but
they
had
merit
enough
to
prick
our
sense
of
beauty
delightfully
where
we
found
them
oh
they
were
good
heaven
send
it
isn
t
a
tommy
said
dora
with
a
falling
countenance
there
is
something
absolutely
inaccessible
about
a
how
could
it
be
i
asked
oh
there
are
some
inspired
ones
but
it
isn
t
that
s
french
technique
it
s
an
englishman
or
an
american
who
has
worked
in
paris
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
is
he
doing
here
oh
i
said
we
have
had
them
you
know
val
prinsep
came
out
at
the
time
of
the
prince
of
wales
s
do
you
remember
that
it
s
a
matter
of
history
i
said
evasively
and
edwin
weeks
travelled
through
india
not
so
many
years
ago
i
saw
his
studio
in
paris
afterward
between
his
own
canvases
and
ahmedabad
balconies
and
delhi
embroideries
and
burmese
buddhas
and
other
things
he
seemed
to
have
carried
off
the
whole
but
they
don
t
come
up
here
ever
they
come
in
the
cold
weather
and
as
they
can
get
plenty
of
snow
and
ice
at
home
they
stay
down
in
the
plains
with
the
precisely
they
do
i
said
and
besides
dora
went
on
with
increasing
excitement
this
isn
t
a
master
you
see
he
doesn
t
send
a
single
picture
only
these
tiny
things
and
there
s
a
certain
tentativeness
miss
harris
her
parasol
handle
pressed
against
her
lips
looked
at
me
with
an
eagerness
that
was
a
pleasure
to
look
at
in
itself
a
certain
weakness
almost
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
drawing
i
said
what
does
that
signify
why
immaturity
of
course
not
enough
he
s
a
student
not
that
it
amounts
to
a
defect
you
know
she
was
as
jealous
already
as
if
she
possessed
the
things
only
a
sign
to
read
by
i
should
be
grateful
for
more
signs
why
should
a
student
come
to
simla
to
teach
perhaps
i
suggested
naturally
one
sought
only
among
reasons
of
utility
it
s
the
kensington
person
who
teaches
when
they
have
worked
in
the
ateliers
and
learned
as
much
as
this
they
never
do
they
paint
fans
and
menu
cards
and
starve
but
they
don
t
sir
william
lamb
member
of
council
for
the
department
of
finance
was
borne
by
the
stream
to
our
sides
the
simile
will
hardly
stand
conscientious
examination
for
the
stream
was
a
thin
one
and
did
no
more
than
trickle
past
while
sir
william
weighed
fifteen
stone
and
was
so
eminent
that
it
could
never
inconvenience
him
at
its
deepest
dora
detached
her
gaze
from
the
pictures
and
turned
her
back
upon
them
i
saw
the
measure
of
precaution
it
was
unavailing
however
what
have
we
here
said
sir
william
dora
removed
her
person
from
his
line
of
vision
and
he
saw
what
we
had
there
the
work
of
a
friend
of
yours
sir
william
was
spoken
of
as
a
cautious
man
he
had
risen
to
his
present
distinction
on
of
mistakes
he
conspicuously
had
not
made
no
said
dora
we
were
wondering
who
the
artist
could
sir
william
looked
at
the
studies
and
had
a
happy
thought
if
you
ask
me
i
should
say
a
child
of
ten
he
said
he
was
also
known
as
a
man
of
humour
miss
harris
had
just
remarked
a
certain
immaturity
i
ventured
oh
well
said
sir
william
this
isn
t
the
royal
academy
is
it
i
always
say
it
s
very
good
of
people
to
send
their
things
here
at
all
and
some
of
them
are
not
half
bad
i
should
call
this
year
s
average
very
high
are
you
pleased
with
the
picture
that
has
taken
your
prize
sir
william
asked
dora
i
have
bought
sir
william
s
chest
underwent
before
our
eyes
an
expansion
of
conscious
virtue
living
is
so
expensive
in
simla
the
purchase
of
a
merely
decorative
object
takes
almost
the
proportion
of
an
act
of
religion
even
by
a
member
of
council
drawing
four
hundred
pounds
a
month
it
is
have
you
seen
it
our
camp
in
natives
cooking
in
the
foreground
fellows
standing
about
smoking
and
a
whole
pile
of
tinned
stores
dumped
down
in
one
corner
exactly
as
they
would
be
don
t
you
know
oh
i
think
the
committee
made
a
very
good
choice
indeed
a
very
good
sir
william
moved
on
and
dora
was
free
to
send
me
an
expressive
glance
isn
t
that
just
like
this
place
she
demanded
let
me
see
the
viceroy
s
medal
the
society
s
silver
medal
five
prizes
from
members
of
council
highly
commended
s
as
thick
as
blackberries
and
these
perfectly
fresh
original
admirable
things
completely
ignored
what
an
absurd
impossible
corner
of
the
earth
it
is
you
look
very
cross
you
two
said
sinclair
trailing
past
come
and
see
the
crazy
china
exhibit
all
made
of
little
bits
you
know
they
say
the
photograph
frames
are
simply
sinclair
s
invitation
was
not
sincere
miss
harris
was
able
to
answer
it
with
a
laugh
and
a
wave
we
remained
beside
the
serious
fact
of
exhibits
who
are
the
judges
this
year
i
asked
not
that
i
did
not
know
precisely
who
they
were
likely
to
be
there
is
a
custom
in
these
matters
and
i
had
been
part
of
simla
for
eleven
years
dora
took
the
catalogue
from
my
hand
and
turned
its
pages
over
mr
cathcart
of
course
the
private
secretary
to
the
viceroy
would
be
on
the
committee
almost
ex
officio
wouldn
t
he
impossible
to
conceive
a
private
secretary
to
the
viceroy
whose
opinion
would
not
be
valuable
upon
any
head
the
member
for
public
works
i
suppose
he
can
build
bridges
or
could
once
therefore
he
can
draw
or
could
once
besides
look
at
his
precedence
and
his
pay
general
haycock
isn
t
he
head
of
the
ordnance
department
i
can
t
think
of
any
other
reason
for
putting
him
on
oh
yes
he
s
a
and
he
is
inventing
a
way
of
taking
coloured
photographs
tilley
the
old
gentleman
that
teaches
elementary
drawing
to
the
little
girls
in
the
diocesan
school
that
s
all
right
and
jay
of
course
because
jay
s
are
the
mainstay
of
the
exhibition
and
he
must
be
given
a
chance
of
expressing
his
opinion
of
she
handed
me
back
the
catalogue
i
have
never
been
really
angry
with
them
before
she
said
are
you
really
angry
now
i
asked
furious
dora
replied
and
indeed
her
face
expressed
indignation
its
lines
were
quite
tense
and
a
spark
shone
oddly
in
the
middle
of
the
eyes
one
could
not
credit
her
with
beauty
but
as
her
lady
friends
were
fond
of
saying
there
was
something
more
in
her
face
i
saw
a
good
deal
more
at
this
moment
and
it
gave
me
pleasure
as
all
her
feelings
did
when
they
came
out
like
that
i
hasten
to
add
that
she
was
not
unpleasing
her
features
had
a
symmetry
and
a
mobility
and
her
eyes
could
take
any
transient
charm
they
chose
to
endow
themselves
with
though
there
were
moments
when
she
compared
very
badly
with
the
other
young
ladies
of
simla
with
their
high
spirits
and
their
pretty
complexions
very
badly
indeed
those
were
occasions
when
the
gay
monotony
of
the
place
pressed
i
imagine
a
little
heavily
upon
her
and
the
dullness
she
felt
translated
itself
in
her
expression
but
she
was
by
no
means
unpleasing
i
must
go
and
see
lady
pilkey
s
picture
i
said
what
is
the
use
said
dora
it
s
a
landscape
in
oils
a
view
of
the
himalayas
near
narkanda
there
are
the
snows
in
the
background
very
thin
and
visionary
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
and
two
hills
one
hill
on
each
side
dark
green
trees
with
a
dead
one
in
the
left
foreground
covered
with
a
brilliant
red
creeper
right
foreground
occupied
by
a
mountain
path
and
a
solitary
native
figure
with
its
back
turned
society
s
silver
when
did
you
see
it
i
asked
i
haven
t
seen
it
this
year
but
i
saw
the
one
she
sent
last
and
the
one
the
year
before
that
you
can
trust
my
memory
no
i
said
i
can
t
i
m
dining
there
tonight
i
must
have
an
original
congratulate
her
on
the
warm
blaze
of
colour
in
the
foreground
it
s
perfectly
safe
urged
miss
harris
but
i
felt
compelled
to
go
myself
to
see
lady
pilkey
s
landscape
when
i
returned
i
found
her
still
sitting
in
grave
absorption
before
the
studies
that
had
taken
us
so
by
surprise
her
face
was
full
of
a
soft
new
light
i
had
never
before
seen
the
spring
touched
in
her
that
could
flood
it
like
that
you
were
very
nearly
right
i
announced
but
the
blaze
of
colour
was
in
the
middle
distance
and
there
was
a
torrent
in
the
foreground
that
quite
put
it
out
and
the
picture
does
take
the
society
s
silver
i
can
not
decide
she
replied
without
looking
at
me
between
the
kattiawar
fair
thing
and
those
hills
in
the
rain
i
can
only
have
one
father
won
t
hear
of
more
than
you
can
have
two
i
said
bluntly
so
deeply
interested
i
was
in
the
effect
the
things
had
on
her
and
i
will
have
a
third
for
myself
i
can
t
withstand
those
i
thought
there
was
moisture
in
the
eyes
she
turned
upon
me
an
unusual
thing
a
most
unusual
thing
in
dora
harris
but
she
winked
it
back
if
it
was
there
too
quickly
for
any
certainty
you
are
a
dear
she
said
once
or
twice
before
she
had
called
me
a
dear
it
reminded
me
as
nothing
else
ever
did
that
i
was
a
contemporary
of
her
father
s
it
is
a
feeble
confession
but
i
have
known
myself
refrain
from
doing
occasional
agreeable
things
apprehending
that
she
might
call
me
a
dear
chapter
dora
had
been
out
three
seasons
when
these
things
happened
i
remember
sharing
edward
harris
s
anxiety
in
no
slight
degree
as
to
how
the
situation
would
resolve
itself
when
she
came
the
situation
consisting
so
considerably
in
his
eyes
of
the
second
harris
who
had
complicated
it
further
with
three
little
boys
all
of
the
age
to
be
led
about
the
station
on
very
small
ponies
and
not
under
any
circumstances
to
be
allowed
in
the
when
one
went
to
tea
with
their
mother
no
one
except
perhaps
poor
ted
himself
was
more
interested
than
i
to
observe
how
the
situation
did
resolve
itself
in
the
decision
of
harris
that
the
boys
the
two
eldest
at
least
must
positively
begin
the
race
for
the
competitive
examinations
of
the
future
without
further
delay
and
that
she
must
as
positively
be
domiciled
in
england
to
be
near
them
at
all
events
until
they
had
well
made
the
start
i
should
have
been
glad
to
see
them
ride
their
ponies
up
and
down
the
mall
a
bit
longer
poor
little
chaps
they
were
still
very
cherubic
to
be
invited
to
take
a
view
of
competitive
examinations
however
distant
but
harris
s
conviction
was
not
to
be
overcome
so
they
went
home
to
begin
and
she
went
with
them
leaving
dora
in
possession
of
her
father
her
father
s
house
his
pay
his
precedence
and
all
that
was
his
not
that
i
would
suggest
any
friction
i
am
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
like
that
at
least
nothing
that
met
the
eye
or
the
ear
dora
adored
the
three
little
boys
and
was
extremely
kind
to
their
mother
she
regarded
this
lady
i
have
reason
to
believe
with
the
greatest
indulgence
and
behaved
towards
her
with
the
greatest
consideration
i
mean
she
had
unerring
intuitions
as
to
just
when
on
afternoons
when
harris
was
at
home
from
dusk
till
dinner
she
should
be
dying
for
a
walk
one
could
imagine
her
looking
with
her
grey
eyes
at
dear
mamma
s
horizon
and
deciding
that
papa
was
certainly
not
enough
to
fill
it
by
himself
deciding
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
never
likely
to
be
ousted
there
only
accompanied
in
a
less
important
and
entirely
innocent
degree
it
may
be
surprising
that
any
one
should
fly
from
so
a
but
the
happy
family
party
lasted
a
bare
three
months
i
think
harris
had
a
perception
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
who
arrived
obscurely
at
very
correct
conclusions
that
she
was
contributing
to
her
s
amusement
in
a
manner
which
her
most
benevolent
intentions
had
not
contemplated
and
she
was
not
by
any
means
the
little
person
to
go
on
doing
that
indefinitely
perhaps
increasingly
besides
it
was
in
the
natural
order
of
things
that
dora
should
marry
and
harris
doubtless
foresaw
a
comfortable
return
for
herself
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
when
the
usual
promising
junior
in
the
department
should
gild
his
own
prospects
and
promote
the
general
by
acquiring
its
head
for
a
things
always
worked
out
if
you
gave
them
time
how
much
time
you
ought
to
give
them
was
doubtless
by
now
a
pretty
constant
query
with
the
little
lady
in
her
foggy
exile
for
two
years
had
already
passed
and
dora
had
found
no
connection
with
any
young
man
of
the
department
more
permanent
than
those
prescribed
at
dinners
and
at
dances
it
is
doubtful
indeed
if
she
had
had
the
opportunity
there
was
no
absolute
means
of
knowing
but
if
offers
were
made
they
never
transpired
and
harris
far
away
in
england
nourished
a
certainty
that
they
never
were
made
speaking
with
her
intimate
knowledge
of
the
sex
she
declared
that
dora
frightened
the
men
that
her
cleverness
was
of
a
kind
to
paralyze
any
sentiment
of
the
sort
that
might
be
expected
it
depended
upon
harris
s
humour
whether
this
was
dora
s
misfortune
or
her
crime
she
dora
never
frightened
me
and
by
the
time
her
cleverness
dawned
upon
me
my
sentiment
about
her
had
become
too
robust
to
be
paralyzed
on
the
contrary
the
agreeable
stimulus
it
gave
me
was
one
of
the
things
i
counted
most
valuable
in
my
life
out
there
it
hardly
mattered
however
that
i
should
confess
this
i
was
not
a
young
man
in
harris
s
department
i
had
a
department
of
my
own
and
dora
though
she
frisked
with
me
gloriously
and
bullied
continually
must
ever
have
been
aware
of
the
formidable
fact
that
i
joined
the
service
two
years
before
edward
harris
did
the
daughter
of
three
generations
of
bureaucrats
was
not
likely
to
forget
that
at
one
time
her
father
had
been
junior
to
me
in
the
same
office
though
in
the
course
of
time
and
the
march
of
opportunity
he
had
his
own
show
now
and
we
nodded
to
each
other
on
the
mall
with
an
equal
sense
of
the
divine
right
of
secretaries
it
may
seem
irrelevant
but
i
feel
compelled
to
explain
here
that
i
had
remained
a
bachelor
while
harris
had
married
twice
and
that
i
had
kept
up
my
cricket
while
harris
had
let
his
figure
take
all
the
soft
curves
of
middle
age
nevertheless
the
fact
remained
sometimes
i
fancied
it
gave
a
certain
piquancy
to
my
relations
with
his
daughter
but
i
could
never
believe
that
the
laugh
was
on
my
side
if
we
met
at
it
would
be
sometimes
edward
harris
and
sometimes
myself
who
would
take
the
dullest
and
stoutest
woman
down
if
she
fell
to
him
the
next
in
precedence
was
bestowed
upon
me
and
there
might
not
be
a
pin
to
choose
between
them
for
phlegm
and
inflation
it
is
a
preposterous
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
married
ladies
of
simla
are
in
the
majority
brilliant
and
fascinating
creatures
who
say
things
in
french
for
greater
convenience
and
lead
a
man
on
after
fifteen
years
i
am
ready
to
swear
that
i
have
been
led
on
to
nothing
more
compromising
than
a
subscription
to
the
young
women
s
christian
association
though
no
one
could
have
been
more
docile
or
more
intelligent
during
one
viceroyalty
of
happy
memory
half
a
dozen
clever
and
amusing
men
and
women
came
together
in
simla
it
was
a
mere
fortuitous
occurrence
aided
by
a
joyous
ruler
who
hated
being
bored
as
none
before
or
ever
since
have
hated
it
and
the
place
has
lived
socially
upon
the
reputation
of
that
meteoric
term
ever
since
whereas
the
domestic
virtues
are
no
more
deeply
rooted
anywhere
than
under
the
deodars
nor
could
any
one
i
hasten
to
add
chronicle
the
fact
with
more
profound
satisfaction
than
myself
a
however
is
not
a
favourable
setting
for
the
domestic
virtues
it
does
them
so
little
justice
that
one
could
sometimes
almost
wish
them
left
at
home
and
i
was
talking
of
simla
where
i
have
encountered
so
many
how
often
have
i
been
consulted
as
to
the
best
school
for
boys
in
england
or
instructed
as
to
how
much
i
should
let
my
man
charge
me
for
or
advised
as
to
the
most
effectual
way
of
preventing
the
butler
from
stealing
my
cheroots
while
dora
harris
remote
as
a
star
talked
to
a
cavalry
subaltern
about
and
splints
at
these
moments
i
felt
my
seniority
bitterly
to
give
dora
to
a
cavalry
subaltern
was
such
plain
waste
it
was
an
infinite
pleasure
to
know
any
one
as
well
as
i
seemed
to
know
dora
harris
she
i
believe
held
no
one
else
upon
the
same
terms
of
intimacy
though
she
found
women
of
course
with
whom
she
fluttered
and
embraced
and
while
there
were
naturally
men
with
whom
i
exchanged
the
time
o
day
in
terms
more
or
less
cordial
i
am
certain
that
i
kept
all
my
closest
thoughts
for
her
it
is
necessary
again
to
know
simla
to
understand
how
our
friendship
was
gilded
by
the
consideration
that
it
was
on
both
sides
perfectly
spontaneous
social
life
in
the
poor
little
place
is
almost
a
pure
farce
with
the
number
of
its
dictated
prompted
intimacies
not
controlled
by
general
laws
of
expediency
as
at
home
but
each
on
its
own
basis
of
hope
and
expectancy
broadly
and
ludicrously
obvious
as
a
case
by
itself
there
is
a
conspiracy
of
stupidity
about
it
for
we
are
all
in
the
same
hat
every
one
of
us
there
is
none
so
exalted
that
he
does
not
urgently
want
a
post
that
somebody
else
can
give
him
so
we
continue
to
exchange
our
depreciated
smiles
and
only
privately
admit
that
the
person
who
most
desires
to
be
agreeable
to
us
is
the
person
whom
we
regard
with
the
greatest
suspicion
as
between
dora
harris
and
myself
there
could
be
naturally
no
ax
to
grind
we
amused
ourselves
by
looking
on
penetratingly
but
tolerantly
at
the
grinding
of
other
people
s
that
was
a
very
principal
bond
between
us
that
uncompromising
clearness
with
which
we
looked
at
the
place
we
lived
in
and
on
the
testimony
of
which
we
were
so
certain
that
we
didn
t
like
it
the
women
were
nearly
all
so
much
in
heaven
in
simla
the
men
so
well
satisfied
to
be
there
too
at
the
top
of
the
tree
that
our
dissatisfaction
gave
us
to
one
another
the
merit
of
originality
almost
proved
in
one
another
a
superior
mind
it
was
not
that
either
of
us
would
have
preferred
to
grill
out
our
days
in
the
plains
we
always
had
a
saving
clause
for
the
climate
the
altitude
the
scenery
it
was
simla
intrinsic
simla
as
its
other
conditions
made
it
with
which
we
found
such
liberal
fault
again
i
should
have
to
explain
simla
at
the
length
of
an
essay
at
least
to
justify
our
condemnation
this
difficulty
confronts
me
everywhere
i
must
ask
you
instead
to
imagine
a
small
colony
of
superior
very
superior
officials
of
british
origin
and
traditions
set
on
the
top
of
a
hill
years
and
miles
away
from
literature
music
pictures
politics
existing
like
a
harem
on
the
gossip
of
the
viceroy
s
intentions
and
depending
for
amusement
on
tennis
and
and
then
consider
you
yourself
whether
you
are
the
sort
of
person
to
be
unquestionably
happy
there
if
you
see
no
reason
to
the
contrary
pray
do
not
go
on
there
were
times
when
dora
declared
that
she
couldn
t
breathe
for
want
of
an
atmosphere
and
times
when
i
looked
round
and
groaned
at
the
cheerful
congratulatory
aridity
in
every
man
s
eye
men
who
had
done
things
at
oxford
in
my
own
year
and
come
out
like
me
to
be
mummified
into
a
last
state
like
this
thank
heaven
there
was
never
any
cheerful
congratulation
in
my
eye
one
could
always
put
there
when
the
thought
inspired
it
a
saving
spark
of
rank
ingratitude
instead
it
was
as
if
we
had
the
most
desirable
things
roses
cool
airs
far
snowy
ranges
to
build
what
we
like
with
and
we
built
simla
altitude
population
headquarters
of
the
government
of
india
during
the
summer
months
an
ark
it
was
of
course
an
ark
of
refuge
from
the
horrible
heat
that
surged
below
and
i
wondered
as
i
climbed
the
steeps
of
summer
hill
in
search
of
armour
s
inaccessible
address
whether
he
was
to
be
the
dove
bearing
beautiful
testimony
of
a
world
coming
nearer
i
rejected
the
simile
however
as
we
had
been
too
long
abandoned
on
our
ararat
chapter
a
dog
of
no
sort
of
caste
stood
in
the
veranda
and
barked
at
me
offensively
i
picked
up
a
stone
and
he
vanished
like
the
dog
of
a
dream
into
the
house
it
was
such
a
small
house
that
it
wasn
t
on
the
municipal
map
at
all
it
looked
as
if
someone
had
built
it
for
amusement
with
anything
that
was
lying
about
nevertheless
it
had
a
name
it
was
called
amy
villa
freshly
painted
in
white
letters
on
a
shiny
black
board
and
nailed
against
the
nearest
tree
in
the
orthodox
simla
fashion
it
looked
as
if
the
owner
of
the
place
had
named
it
as
a
duty
towards
his
tenant
the
board
was
so
new
and
in
that
case
the
reflection
presented
itself
that
the
tenant
might
have
cooperated
to
call
it
something
else
it
was
disconcerting
somehow
to
find
that
our
dove
had
perched
even
temporarily
in
amy
villa
nor
was
it
soothing
to
discover
that
the
small
white
object
stuck
in
the
corner
of
the
board
was
ingersoll
armour
s
card
in
simla
we
do
not
stick
our
cards
about
in
that
way
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
the
weather
we
paint
our
names
neatly
under
the
names
of
our
houses
with
for
indian
civil
service
or
for
public
works
department
or
whatever
designation
we
are
entitled
to
immediately
after
so
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
this
strikes
newcomers
sometimes
as
a
little
professional
especially
when
a
hand
accompanies
pointing
but
it
is
the
only
possible
way
where
there
are
no
streets
and
no
numbers
but
where
houses
are
dropped
about
a
hilltop
as
if
they
had
fallen
from
a
in
sticking
his
card
out
like
that
armour
seemed
to
imagine
himself
au
quatrieme
or
au
cinquieme
somewhere
on
the
south
side
of
the
seine
it
betrayed
rather
a
ridiculous
lack
of
conformity
he
was
high
enough
up
however
to
give
any
illusion
i
had
to
stop
to
find
the
wind
to
announce
myself
there
was
nobody
else
to
do
it
if
i
except
the
dog
i
walked
into
the
veranda
and
shouted
then
i
saw
that
one
end
of
it
was
partly
glazed
off
and
inside
sat
a
young
man
in
his
with
his
back
to
the
door
in
reply
he
called
out
that
you
rosario
and
i
stood
silent
taken
somewhat
aback
there
was
only
one
rosario
in
simla
and
he
was
a
subordinate
in
my
own
office
again
the
hateful
need
to
explain
between
subordinate
clerks
and
officials
in
simla
there
is
a
greater
gulf
fixed
than
was
ever
imagined
in
parable
besides
rosario
had
a
plain
strain
of
what
we
call
the
country
in
him
a
plain
strain
that
is
of
the
colour
of
the
country
it
was
certainly
the
first
time
in
my
official
career
that
i
had
been
mistaken
for
rosario
armour
turned
round
and
saw
me
that
i
was
a
stranger
he
got
up
at
once
oh
he
said
i
thought
it
was
rosario
it
isn
t
i
replied
my
name
is
philips
may
i
ask
whether
you
were
expecting
rosario
i
can
come
again
you
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
sit
down
he
may
drop
in
or
he
may
not
i
rather
thought
he
would
today
it
s
a
pull
up
isn
t
it
from
the
mall
have
a
whisky
and
i
stood
on
the
threshold
spellbound
it
was
just
the
smell
that
bound
me
the
good
old
smell
of
oil
paints
and
turpentine
and
mediums
and
varnish
and
new
canvas
that
you
never
by
any
chance
put
your
nose
into
in
any
part
of
asia
it
carried
me
back
twenty
years
to
old
haunts
old
friends
old
joys
ideals
theories
ah
to
be
young
and
have
a
temperament
for
i
had
one
then
that
instant
in
armour
s
veranda
proved
it
to
me
forever
no
thanks
i
said
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
just
have
the
the
young
fellow
knew
at
once
that
i
liked
the
smell
well
have
a
chair
anyhow
he
said
and
took
one
himself
and
sat
down
opposite
me
letting
his
lean
brown
hands
fall
between
his
knees
do
you
mind
i
said
if
for
a
minute
i
sit
still
and
look
round
he
understood
again
i
haven
t
brought
much
he
said
i
left
pretty
near
everything
in
you
have
brought
a
then
after
a
moment
did
you
do
that
i
asked
nodding
towards
a
canvas
tacked
against
the
wall
it
was
the
head
of
a
arab
woman
turned
away
the
picture
was
in
the
turning
away
and
the
shadow
the
made
over
the
cheek
and
lips
lord
no
that
s
dagnan
bouveret
i
used
to
take
my
things
to
him
and
one
day
he
gave
me
that
you
have
an
eye
he
added
but
without
patronage
it
s
the
best
thing
i
ve
i
felt
the
warmth
of
an
old
thrill
once
upon
a
time
i
said
i
was
allowed
to
have
an
the
wine
untasted
all
those
years
went
to
my
head
that
s
a
vigorous
bit
above
i
continued
oh
well
it
isn
t
really
up
to
much
you
know
it
s
rosario
s
he
photographs
mostly
but
he
has
a
notion
of
really
said
i
thinking
with
regard
to
my
eye
that
the
sun
of
that
atrocious
country
had
put
it
out
i
expect
i
ve
lost
it
i
said
aloud
your
eye
oh
you
ll
easily
get
a
fresh
one
do
you
go
home
for
the
exhibitions
i
did
once
i
confessed
my
first
leave
a
kind
of
paralysis
overtakes
one
here
last
time
i
went
for
the
he
glanced
at
me
with
his
light
clear
eyes
as
if
for
the
first
time
he
encountered
a
difficulty
it
s
a
magnificent
country
for
painting
he
said
but
not
for
pictures
i
rejoined
he
paid
no
attention
staring
at
the
ground
and
twisting
one
end
of
his
moustache
the
sun
on
those
old
marble
tombs
broad
sun
and
sand
you
mean
somewhere
about
i
couldn
t
get
anywhere
near
he
was
not
at
that
moment
anywhere
near
me
but
i
have
thought
out
a
trick
or
two
i
mean
to
have
another
go
when
it
cools
off
again
down
he
returned
with
a
smile
and
i
saw
how
delicate
his
face
was
the
smile
turned
down
with
a
little
gentle
mockery
in
its
lines
i
had
seen
that
particular
smile
only
on
the
faces
of
one
or
two
beautiful
women
it
had
a
borrowed
air
upon
a
man
like
a
tiara
or
an
earring
there
s
plenty
to
paint
he
said
looking
at
me
with
an
air
of
friendly
speculation
indeed
yes
and
it
has
never
been
done
we
are
sure
it
has
never
been
we
you
mean
people
generally
not
at
all
i
mean
miss
harris
miss
harris
and
your
daughter
my
name
is
philips
i
reminded
him
pleasantly
remembering
that
the
intelligence
of
clever
people
is
often
limited
to
a
single
art
miss
harris
is
the
daughter
of
edward
harris
secretary
of
the
government
of
india
in
the
legislative
department
she
is
fond
of
pictures
we
have
a
good
many
tastes
in
common
we
have
always
suspected
that
india
had
never
been
painted
and
when
we
saw
your
things
at
the
town
hall
we
knew
his
queer
eyes
dilated
and
he
blushed
oh
he
said
it
s
only
one
interpretation
it
all
depends
on
what
a
fellow
sees
no
fellow
can
see
till
you
came
i
insisted
nobody
had
seen
he
shook
his
head
but
i
could
read
in
his
face
that
this
was
not
news
to
him
that
is
mainly
what
i
came
up
to
tell
you
i
continued
to
beg
that
you
will
go
on
and
on
to
hope
that
you
will
stay
a
long
time
and
do
a
great
deal
it
is
such
an
extraordinary
chance
that
any
one
should
turn
up
who
can
say
what
the
country
really
he
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
with
a
restive
movement
oh
don
t
make
me
feel
responsible
he
said
i
hate
that
and
then
suddenly
he
remembered
his
manners
but
it
s
certainly
nice
of
you
to
think
so
he
added
there
was
something
a
little
unusual
in
his
inflection
which
led
me
to
ask
at
this
point
whether
he
was
an
american
and
to
discover
that
he
came
from
somewhere
in
wisconsin
not
directly
but
by
way
of
a
few
years
in
london
and
paris
this
accounted
in
a
way
for
the
effect
of
freedom
in
any
fortune
about
him
for
which
i
already
liked
him
and
perhaps
partly
for
the
look
of
unembarrassed
inquiry
and
experiment
which
sat
so
lightly
in
his
unlined
face
he
came
one
realized
out
of
the
fermentation
of
new
conditions
he
never
could
have
been
the
product
of
our
limits
and
systems
and
classes
in
england
his
surroundings
his
things
as
he
called
them
were
as
old
as
the
sense
of
beauty
but
he
seemed
simply
to
have
put
them
where
he
could
see
them
there
was
no
pose
in
their
arrangement
they
were
all
good
and
his
delight
in
them
was
plain
but
he
was
evidently
in
no
sense
a
connoisseur
beyond
that
of
natural
instinct
some
of
those
he
had
picked
up
in
india
i
could
tell
him
about
but
i
had
no
impression
that
he
would
remember
what
i
said
there
was
one
bokhara
tapestry
i
examined
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
yes
he
said
they
told
me
i
shouldn
t
get
anything
as
good
as
that
out
here
so
i
brought
it
but
i
had
to
explain
to
him
why
it
was
anomalous
that
this
should
be
so
it
came
a
good
many
miles
over
desert
from
somewhere
he
remarked
as
i
made
a
note
of
inquiry
as
to
the
present
direction
of
trade
in
woven
goods
from
persia
i
had
to
pound
it
for
a
week
to
get
the
dust
we
spent
an
hour
looking
over
work
he
had
done
down
in
the
plains
and
then
i
took
my
leave
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
moment
to
ask
armour
to
come
to
the
club
or
to
offer
to
do
anything
for
him
all
the
hospitality
all
that
was
worth
offering
seemed
so
much
more
at
his
disposition
than
at
mine
i
only
asked
if
i
might
come
again
mentioning
somewhat
shyly
that
i
must
have
the
opportunity
of
adding
at
my
leisure
to
those
of
his
pictures
that
were
already
mine
by
transaction
with
the
secretary
of
the
art
exhibition
i
left
him
so
astonished
that
this
had
happened
so
plainly
pleased
that
i
was
certain
he
had
never
sold
anything
before
in
his
life
this
impression
gave
me
the
uplifted
joy
of
a
discoverer
to
add
to
the
satisfactions
i
had
already
drawn
from
the
afternoon
and
i
almost
bounded
down
the
hill
to
the
mall
i
left
the
pi
dog
barking
in
the
veranda
and
i
met
rosario
coming
up
but
in
my
unusual
elation
i
hardly
paused
to
consider
either
of
them
further
the
mare
and
her
groom
were
waiting
on
the
mall
and
it
was
only
when
i
got
on
her
back
that
the
consciousness
visited
me
of
something
forgotten
it
was
my
mission
to
propose
to
take
armour
if
he
were
possible
to
call
upon
the
harrises
oh
well
he
was
possible
enough
i
supposed
he
possessed
a
coat
though
he
hadn
t
been
wearing
it
and
i
could
arrange
it
by
letter
meanwhile
as
was
only
fair
i
turned
the
mare
in
the
direction
of
the
where
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
miss
dora
harris
was
quenching
her
impatience
in
tea
chapter
the
very
next
morning
i
met
armour
on
my
way
to
the
office
he
was
ambling
along
on
the
leanest
and
most
of
bazaar
ponies
and
he
wore
a
bowler
in
simla
sun
hats
are
admissible
straw
hats
are
presentable
and
soft
felt
hats
are
superior
but
you
must
not
wear
a
bowler
i
might
almost
say
that
if
one
s
glance
falls
upon
a
bowler
one
hardly
looks
further
the
expectation
of
finding
an
acquaintance
under
it
is
so
vain
in
this
instance
i
did
look
further
fortunately
though
in
doing
so
i
was
compelled
to
notice
that
the
bowler
was
not
lifted
in
answer
to
my
salutation
of
no
importance
in
itself
of
course
but
betraying
in
armour
a
certain
lack
of
observation
i
felt
the
departmental
head
crumble
in
me
however
as
i
recognized
him
and
i
pulled
the
mare
up
in
a
manner
which
she
plainly
resented
it
was
my
opportunity
to
do
cautiously
and
delicately
what
i
had
omitted
the
afternoon
before
but
my
recollection
is
that
i
was
very
clumsy
i
said
something
about
the
dust
and
he
said
something
about
the
glare
and
then
i
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
ask
him
if
he
wouldn
t
like
to
meet
a
few
simla
people
oh
i
know
lots
of
people
thanks
he
said
it
s
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
all
the
same
but
i
ve
got
any
amount
of
friends
i
thought
of
rosario
and
stood
or
sat
confounded
the
mare
fidgeted
i
knocked
a
beast
of
a
fly
off
her
and
so
gained
time
this
is
my
second
season
up
here
you
your
second
season
i
exclaimed
where
on
earth
have
you
been
hiding
well
i
didn
t
exhibit
last
year
you
see
i
d
heard
it
was
a
kind
of
a
toy
show
so
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
i
think
now
that
was
foolish
but
i
got
to
know
quite
a
number
of
but
i
am
sure
there
are
numbers
that
you
haven
t
met
i
urged
or
i
should
have
heard
of
he
glanced
at
me
with
a
slight
flush
if
you
mean
society
people
he
said
i
don
t
care
about
that
kind
of
thing
philips
i
m
not
adapted
to
it
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
if
any
one
offered
to
introduce
me
to
the
viceroy
i
would
ask
to
be
oh
the
viceroy
i
responded
disrespectfully
is
neither
here
nor
there
but
there
are
some
people
friends
of
my
own
who
would
like
very
much
to
meet
by
the
name
of
harris
he
asked
i
was
too
amazed
to
do
anything
but
nod
by
the
name
of
harris
the
secretary
of
the
government
of
india
in
the
legislative
department
the
expression
not
used
as
an
invocation
was
inexcusable
i
remember
you
mentioned
them
yes
i
said
there
s
a
father
and
daughter
miss
harris
is
very
his
face
clouded
as
well
it
might
at
the
word
does
she
paint
he
asked
so
apprehensively
that
i
could
not
forbear
a
smile
at
dora
s
expense
i
could
assure
him
that
she
did
not
paint
that
she
had
not
painted
at
all
events
for
years
and
presently
i
found
myself
in
the
ridiculous
position
of
using
argument
to
bring
a
young
man
to
the
harrises
in
the
end
i
prevailed
i
know
out
of
sheer
good
nature
on
armour
s
part
he
was
as
innocent
as
a
baby
of
any
sense
of
opportunity
we
arranged
it
for
the
following
friday
but
as
luck
would
have
it
his
excellency
sent
for
me
at
the
very
hour
we
met
the
messenger
i
felt
myself
unlucky
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
armour
should
go
alone
which
he
did
with
neither
diffidence
nor
alacrity
but
as
if
it
were
all
in
the
day
s
work
and
he
had
no
reason
to
be
disobliging
the
files
were
very
heavy
during
the
succeeding
fortnight
and
the
viceroy
quite
importunate
in
his
demand
for
my
valuable
suggestions
i
was
worked
off
my
legs
and
two
or
three
times
was
obliged
to
deny
myself
in
replying
to
notes
from
dora
suggesting
sunday
breakfast
or
afternoon
tea
finally
i
shook
myself
free
it
was
the
day
she
wrote
you
must
come
i
can
t
keep
it
to
myself
any
i
half
thought
armour
would
be
there
but
he
wasn
t
that
is
he
was
absent
corporeally
but
the
spirit
and
expression
of
him
littered
every
convenient
part
some
few
things
lay
about
that
i
had
seen
in
the
studio
to
call
it
so
but
most
of
the
little
wooden
panels
looked
fresh
almost
wet
and
the
air
held
strongly
the
fragrance
of
armour
s
north
veranda
in
one
corner
there
used
to
be
a
madonna
on
a
carved
easel
the
madonna
stood
on
the
floor
and
the
easel
with
working
pegs
in
it
held
an
unfinished
canvas
dora
sat
in
the
midst
with
a
distinct
flush
she
was
inclined
to
be
sallow
and
made
me
welcome
in
terms
touched
with
extravagance
she
did
not
rush
however
upon
the
matter
that
was
dyeing
her
cheeks
and
i
showed
myself
as
little
impetuous
she
poured
out
the
tea
and
we
sat
there
inhaling
as
it
were
the
aroma
of
the
thing
while
keeping
it
consciously
in
the
background
i
imagine
there
was
no
moment
in
the
time
i
describe
when
we
enjoyed
ingersoll
armour
so
much
as
at
this
one
when
he
lay
in
his
nimbus
half
known
and
wholly
suppressed
between
us
there
were
later
instances
perhaps
of
deeper
satisfaction
but
they
were
more
or
less
perplexed
and
not
unobscured
by
anxiety
that
afternoon
it
was
all
to
know
and
to
be
experienced
with
just
a
delicious
foretaste
i
said
something
presently
about
lady
pilkey
s
picnic
on
the
morrow
to
which
we
had
both
been
bidden
shall
i
call
for
you
i
asked
you
will
ride
of
thanks
but
i
ve
cried
off
i
m
going
her
eyes
plainly
added
with
ingersoll
armour
but
she
as
obviously
shrank
from
the
roughness
of
pitching
him
in
that
unconsidered
way
before
us
for
some
reason
i
refrained
from
taking
the
cue
i
would
not
lug
him
in
either
that
is
a
new
accomplishment
was
as
much
as
i
felt
i
could
say
with
dignity
and
she
responded
yes
isn
t
it
i
felt
some
slight
indignation
on
lady
pilkey
s
account
do
you
really
think
you
ought
to
do
things
like
that
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
asked
but
dora
smiled
at
a
glance
the
hypocrisy
out
of
my
face
what
does
anything
matter
she
demanded
i
knew
perfectly
well
the
standard
by
which
nothing
mattered
and
there
was
no
use
of
course
in
going
on
pretending
that
i
did
not
i
assured
him
that
you
didn
t
paint
i
said
accusingly
oh
i
had
to
otherwise
what
was
there
to
go
upon
he
would
have
been
found
only
to
be
lost
again
you
did
not
contemplate
that
miss
harris
inquired
sweetly
i
should
have
thought
it
was
the
surest
way
of
losing
i
can
t
think
why
you
should
be
so
rude
he
observes
progress
with
a
view
to
claiming
and
holding
him
would
it
be
of
any
use
i
asked
for
me
to
start
in
oils
miss
harris
eyed
me
calmly
i
don
t
know
she
said
but
it
doesn
t
seem
the
same
thing
somehow
i
think
you
had
better
leave
it
to
indeed
i
won
t
i
said
there
is
too
much
in
it
and
we
smiled
across
the
gulf
of
our
friendly
understanding
i
crossed
to
the
mantelpiece
and
picked
up
one
of
the
little
wet
panels
there
was
that
in
it
which
explained
my
friend
s
exultation
much
more
plainly
than
words
that
is
what
i
am
to
show
him
tomorrow
she
exclaimed
i
think
i
have
done
as
he
told
me
i
think
it
s
pretty
whether
it
was
pretty
right
or
pretty
wrong
she
had
taken
in
an
extraordinary
way
an
essence
out
of
him
it
wasn
t
of
course
good
but
his
feeling
was
reflected
in
it
at
once
so
brilliantly
and
so
profoundly
that
it
was
startling
to
see
do
you
think
he
ll
be
pleased
she
asked
anxiously
i
think
he
ll
be
astounded
i
said
reserving
the
rest
and
she
cried
in
her
pleasure
oh
you
dear
man
i
see
you
have
taken
possession
of
him
i
went
on
ah
body
and
soul
dora
rejoined
and
it
must
have
been
something
like
that
i
could
imagine
how
she
did
it
with
what
wiles
of
simplicity
and
candid
she
had
drawn
him
to
forgetfulness
and
response
and
how
presently
his
enthusiasm
leaped
up
to
answer
hers
and
they
had
been
caught
altogether
out
of
the
plane
of
common
relations
and
he
had
gone
away
on
that
disgraceful
bazaar
pony
with
a
ratified
arrangement
to
return
next
day
which
had
been
almost
taken
for
granted
from
the
beginning
i
confess
though
i
had
helped
to
bring
it
about
the
situation
didn
t
altogether
please
me
i
did
not
dream
of
foolish
dangers
but
it
seemed
to
take
a
little
too
much
for
granted
i
found
myself
inwardly
demanding
whether
after
all
a
vivid
capacity
to
make
colour
conscious
was
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
to
bring
to
edward
harris
s
house
a
young
man
about
whom
we
knew
nothing
whatever
else
an
instant
s
regard
showed
the
scruple
fraudulent
it
fled
before
the
rush
of
pleasure
with
which
i
gazed
at
the
tokens
he
had
left
behind
him
i
fell
back
on
my
wonder
which
was
great
that
dora
should
have
possessed
the
technique
necessary
to
take
him
at
a
point
where
he
could
give
her
so
much
that
was
valuable
oh
well
she
said
when
i
uttered
it
you
know
i
made
the
experiment
i
found
out
in
south
kensington
you
can
learn
that
much
there
that
i
never
would
be
able
to
paint
well
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
so
i
dropped
it
and
took
a
more
general
line
towards
life
but
i
find
it
very
easy
to
imagine
myself
dedicated
to
that
particular
one
you
never
told
me
i
said
why
had
i
been
shut
out
of
that
experience
i
tell
you
now
dora
replied
absently
when
i
am
able
to
offer
you
the
fact
with
she
laughed
and
dropped
a
still
illuminated
face
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
he
has
wonderfully
revived
me
she
declared
i
could
throw
honestly
the
whole
of
simla
overboard
for
don
t
i
urged
feeling
suddenly
an
integral
part
of
simla
oh
no
what
end
would
be
served
but
i
don
t
care
who
knows
she
went
on
with
a
rush
that
in
all
life
this
is
what
i
like
best
and
people
like
armour
are
the
people
i
value
most
heavens
how
few
of
them
there
are
and
wherever
they
go
how
the
air
clears
up
round
them
it
makes
me
quite
ill
to
think
of
the
life
we
lead
here
the
poverty
of
it
the
preposterous
dullness
of
it
for
goodness
sake
i
said
obscurely
irritated
don
t
quote
the
bishop
the
life
holds
whatever
we
put
into
for
other
people
it
does
and
for
us
it
holds
what
other
people
put
into
it
she
retorted
i
don
t
know
whether
you
think
it
s
adequately
filled
with
gold
lace
and
why
should
i
defend
it
i
asked
not
knowing
indeed
why
but
it
has
perhaps
a
dignity
you
know
ah
you
are
too
fresh
from
your
baptism
i
continued
as
she
shook
her
head
and
went
to
the
piano
the
quality
whatever
it
was
that
the
last
fortnight
had
generated
in
her
leaped
from
her
fingers
she
played
with
triumph
elation
intention
the
notes
seemed
an
outlet
for
the
sense
of
beauty
and
for
power
to
make
it
i
had
never
heard
her
play
like
that
before
it
occurred
to
me
to
ask
when
she
had
done
how
far
after
a
fortnight
she
could
throw
light
on
armour
s
aims
and
history
where
he
had
come
from
and
the
great
query
with
which
we
first
received
him
what
he
could
be
doing
in
simla
i
gathered
that
she
had
learned
practically
nothing
and
had
hardly
concerned
herself
to
learn
anything
what
difference
did
it
make
she
asked
me
why
should
we
inquire
why
tack
a
theory
of
origin
to
a
phenomenon
of
joy
let
us
say
the
wind
brought
him
and
build
him
a
temple
she
was
very
whimsical
up
to
the
furthest
stretch
of
what
could
possibly
be
considered
when
i
went
away
i
saw
her
go
again
and
sit
down
at
the
piano
in
the
veranda
i
remembered
something
stopped
and
went
back
i
had
to
go
back
you
did
not
tell
me
i
said
when
he
was
coming
oh
tomorrow
tomorrow
of
course
dora
paused
to
reply
i
resented
as
i
made
my
way
to
the
club
the
weight
of
official
duties
that
made
it
so
impossible
for
me
to
keep
at
all
closely
in
touch
with
this
young
man
chapter
the
art
of
the
photographer
usually
arouses
in
me
all
that
is
splenetic
and
i
had
not
submitted
myself
to
him
for
years
before
dora
made
such
a
preposterous
point
of
it
years
in
which
as
i
sadly
explained
to
her
i
might
have
submitted
to
the
ordeal
with
much
more
pleasing
results
she
had
often
insisted
before
but
i
could
never
see
that
she
made
out
a
particularly
good
case
for
the
operation
until
one
afternoon
when
she
showed
me
the
bold
counterfeit
presentment
of
an
assistant
or
some
such
person
much
flattered
as
to
features
but
singularly
faithful
in
its
reproduction
of
the
straps
and
buttons
attached
to
my
post
also
there
belongs
a
uniform
and
a
cocked
hat
sufficiently
dramatic
but
persons
who
serve
the
state
primarily
with
the
intelligence
are
supposed
to
have
a
mind
above
buttons
and
when
i
decided
that
my
photograph
should
compete
with
the
assistant
s
i
gave
him
every
sartorial
advantage
i
gathered
that
the
offer
cabinet
size
of
this
gentleman
had
been
a
spontaneous
one
that
certainly
could
not
be
said
of
mine
most
unwillingly
i
turned
one
morning
into
kauffer
s
and
i
can
not
now
imagine
why
i
did
it
for
emulation
of
the
assistant
was
really
not
motive
enough
unless
it
was
with
an
instinct
prepared
to
stumble
upon
matter
germane
in
an
absurd
degree
to
this
little
history
i
had
the
honour
to
be
subjected
to
the
searching
analysis
of
kauffer
himself
it
was
he
who
placed
the
chair
and
arranged
the
screw
he
who
fixed
the
angle
of
my
chin
and
gently
disposed
my
fingers
on
my
knee
he
gave
me
i
remember
a
recent
portrait
of
the
viceroy
to
fix
my
eye
upon
doubtless
with
the
purpose
of
inspiring
my
countenance
with
the
devotion
which
would
sit
suitably
upon
one
of
his
excellency
s
slaves
and
when
it
was
all
over
he
conducted
me
into
another
apartment
in
order
that
i
might
see
the
very
latest
viceregal
group
a
domestic
one
including
the
staff
the
walls
of
the
room
contained
what
is
usually
there
the
enlarged
photograph
the
coloured
photograph
the
amateur
theatrical
group
the
group
of
his
excellency
s
executive
council
the
native
dignitary
with
a
aigrette
in
the
front
of
his
turban
the
copy
in
oils
of
some
old
italian
landscape
very
black
and
yellow
also
held
its
invariable
place
and
above
it
very
near
the
ceiling
a
line
of
canvases
which
had
i
not
been
led
past
them
to
inspect
our
ruler
and
his
family
who
sat
transfixed
on
an
easel
in
a
resplendent
frame
would
probably
have
escaped
my
attention
i
did
proper
homage
to
the
easel
and
then
turned
to
those
pictures
it
was
plain
enough
who
had
painted
them
armour
s
broad
brush
stood
out
all
over
them
they
were
mostly
indian
sporting
subjects
the
incident
a
trifle
elliptical
the
drawing
unequal
but
the
verve
and
feeling
unmistakeable
and
colour
to
send
a
quiver
of
glorious
acquiescence
through
you
like
a
pang
what
astonished
me
was
the
number
of
them
there
must
have
been
at
least
a
dozen
all
the
same
size
and
shape
all
hanging
in
a
line
of
dazzling
repetition
here
then
was
the
explanation
of
armour
s
seeming
curious
lack
of
output
and
plain
denial
of
the
supposition
that
he
spent
the
whole
of
his
time
in
doing
the
little
wooden
pochade
things
whose
sweetness
and
delicacy
had
so
feasted
our
eyes
elsewhere
it
was
part
no
doubt
of
his
absolutely
uncommercial
nature
we
had
experienced
together
passages
of
the
keenest
embarrassment
over
my
purchase
of
some
of
his
studies
that
he
had
not
mentioned
these
more
serious
things
exposed
at
kauffer
s
one
had
the
feeling
of
coming
unexpectedly
on
treasure
left
upon
the
wayside
and
forgotten
hullo
i
said
at
a
standstill
i
see
you
ve
got
some
of
armour
s
work
kauffer
with
his
hands
behind
him
made
the
sound
which
has
its
counterpart
in
a
shrug
yass
he
said
i
haf
some
of
armour
s
work
there
this
one
that
one
all
those
remaining
pictures
they
are
all
the
work
of
i
didn
t
know
that
any
of
his
things
were
to
be
seen
outside
his
studio
i
observed
so
they
are
to
be
seen
here
there
is
no
why
should
there
be
any
objection
i
demanded
slightly
nettled
people
must
see
them
before
they
buy
buy
them
kauffer
s
tone
was
distinctly
exasperated
who
will
buy
these
pictures
nobody
they
are
all
every
one
of
them
to
if
you
know
armour
well
enough
i
said
you
should
advise
him
to
exhibit
some
of
his
local
studies
and
sketches
here
they
might
sell
my
words
seemed
unfortunately
chosen
kauffer
turned
an
honest
angry
red
do
i
not
know
armour
well
enough
und
better
he
exclaimed
what
this
man
wass
doing
when
i
in
paris
find
him
oudt
shtarving
mein
gott
i
see
his
work
i
see
he
paint
a
very
goot
horse
very
goot
animal
subject
i
bring
him
oudt
on
contract
five
hundred
rupees
the
monnth
to
paint
for
me
for
my
firm
sir
it
is
now
nine
monnth
i
am
yoost
four
tousand
five
hundred
rupees
out
of
my
pocket
by
this
gentleman
to
enable
me
to
cope
with
this
astonishing
tale
i
asked
kauffer
for
a
chair
which
he
obligingly
gave
me
and
begged
that
he
also
would
be
seated
the
files
at
my
office
were
my
business
and
this
was
not
but
no
matter
of
imperial
concern
seemed
at
the
moment
half
so
urgently
to
require
probing
surely
i
said
that
is
an
unusual
piece
of
enterprise
for
a
photographic
firm
to
employ
an
artist
to
paint
on
a
salary
i
don
t
know
even
a
regular
dealer
who
does
kauffer
at
once
and
frankly
explained
it
was
unusual
and
entirely
out
of
the
regular
line
of
business
it
was
in
fact
one
of
the
exceptional
forms
of
enterprise
inspired
in
this
country
by
the
native
prince
we
who
had
to
treat
with
the
native
prince
solely
on
lofty
political
lines
were
hardly
likely
to
remember
how
largely
he
bulked
in
the
humbler
relations
of
trade
but
there
was
more
than
one
calcutta
establishment
kauffer
declared
that
would
be
obliged
to
put
up
its
shutters
without
this
inconstant
and
difficult
but
liberal
customer
i
waited
with
impatience
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
armour
s
connection
with
the
native
prince
who
is
seldom
a
patron
of
the
arts
for
their
own
sakes
surely
i
said
you
could
not
depend
on
the
indian
nobility
to
buy
landscapes
they
never
do
i
know
of
only
one
distinguished
exception
and
he
lives
a
thousand
miles
from
here
in
no
not
landscape
returned
kauffer
but
that
indian
nobleman
will
buy
his
portrait
we
send
our
own
man
photographic
artist
to
his
state
and
he
photograph
the
chief
and
his
arab
the
chief
and
his
prime
minister
the
chief
in
his
durbar
palace
gardens
stables
everything
presently
the
chief
goes
on
a
big
shoot
he
says
he
will
not
have
a
plain
photograph
besides
it
is
difficult
he
will
have
a
painting
and
he
will
ah
i
said
i
begin
to
you
see
then
i
send
this
armour
look
kauffer
continued
with
rising
excitement
baited
apparently
by
the
unfortunate
canvas
to
which
he
pointed
when
armour
go
to
make
that
i
say
you
go
paint
ze
maharajah
of
gridigurh
spearing
ze
wild
pig
you
see
what
he
make
well
i
said
it
is
a
wonderfully
spirited
dashing
thing
and
the
treatment
of
all
that
and
jungle
grass
is
ze
treatment
pardon
me
sir
i
overboil
do
you
know
which
is
ze
maharajah
i
can
t
say
i
neider
does
he
ze
maharajah
refuse
zat
picture
he
is
a
good
fellow
too
he
says
it
is
a
portrait
of
ze
but
it
is
so
good
i
protested
of
the
but
that
does
not
interest
the
maharajah
you
onderstand
no
you
see
this
one
nawab
of
kandore
on
his
state
no
doubt
about
it
i
said
i
know
the
nawab
well
the
young
scoundrel
how
dignified
he
looks
there
was
a
note
of
real
sorrow
in
kauffer
s
voice
dignified
oh
yes
dignified
but
you
observe
also
black
the
nawab
will
not
be
painted
black
at
once
it
is
on
my
but
he
is
black
i
remonstrated
he
s
the
darkest
native
i
ve
ever
seen
among
the
no
matter
for
that
he
will
not
be
black
when
i
photograph
that
nawab
any
nawab
i
do
not
him
black
make
but
ziss
ass
of
armour
ach
it
was
a
fascinating
subject
and
i
could
have
pursued
it
all
along
the
line
of
poor
armour
s
rejected
canvases
but
the
need
to
get
away
from
kauffer
with
his
equal
claim
upon
my
sympathy
was
too
great
to
have
cracked
my
solemn
mask
by
a
single
smile
would
have
been
to
break
down
irrepressibly
and
never
since
i
set
foot
in
india
had
i
felt
a
parallel
desire
to
laugh
and
to
weep
there
was
a
pang
in
it
which
i
recognize
as
impossible
to
convey
arising
from
the
point
of
contact
almost
unimaginable
yet
so
clear
before
me
of
the
uncompromising
ideals
of
the
atelier
and
the
naive
demands
of
the
oriental
with
an
unhappy
photographer
caught
between
and
wriggling
the
situation
was
really
monstrous
the
fatuous
rejection
of
all
that
fine
scheming
and
exquisite
manipulation
and
it
did
not
grow
less
so
as
kauffer
continued
to
unfold
it
armour
had
not
apparently
proceeded
to
the
scene
of
his
labours
without
instructions
in
the
delineation
he
had
been
specially
told
that
the
maharajah
and
the
pig
were
to
be
in
the
middle
with
the
rest
nowhere
and
nothing
between
other
injunctions
were
as
clear
and
as
clearly
disregarded
armour
like
the
maharajahs
had
simply
refuse
to
abandon
his
premeditated
conceptions
of
how
the
thing
should
be
done
and
here
was
the
result
for
the
laughter
of
the
gods
and
anybody
else
that
might
see
i
asked
kauffer
unguardedly
if
no
sort
of
pressure
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
these
chaps
to
make
them
pay
up
his
face
beaming
with
hope
and
intelligence
he
suggested
that
i
should
approach
the
foreign
office
in
his
behalf
but
this
i
could
not
quite
see
my
way
to
the
coercion
of
native
rulers
i
explained
was
a
difficult
and
a
dangerous
art
and
to
insist
for
example
that
one
of
them
should
recognize
his
own
complexion
might
be
to
run
up
a
disproportionate
little
bill
of
our
own
i
did
however
compound
something
with
kauffer
i
hope
it
wasn
t
a
felony
look
here
i
said
to
kauffer
this
isn
t
official
you
know
in
any
way
but
how
would
it
do
to
write
that
scamp
kandore
a
formal
letter
regretting
that
the
portrait
does
not
suit
him
and
asking
his
permission
to
dispose
of
it
to
me
of
course
it
is
yours
to
do
as
you
like
with
already
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
ask
i
should
like
it
but
the
porcha
tiger
beat
will
do
as
kauffer
nearly
fell
upon
my
neck
that
kandore
will
buy
it
to
put
in
one
bonfire
first
he
assured
me
and
i
sincerely
hoped
for
his
sake
that
it
would
be
the
case
of
course
it
s
understood
i
bethought
me
to
say
that
i
get
it
if
i
do
get
it
at
armour
s
price
i
m
not
a
maharajah
you
know
and
it
isn
t
a
portrait
of
of
course
said
kauffer
but
i
sink
i
sell
you
that
porcha
it
is
ze
best
of
ze
chapter
i
ventured
for
a
few
days
to
keep
the
light
which
chance
had
shed
for
me
upon
armour
s
affairs
to
myself
the
whole
thing
considered
in
connection
with
his
rare
and
delicate
talent
seemed
too
derogatory
and
disastrous
to
impart
without
the
sense
of
doing
him
some
kind
of
injury
in
the
mere
statement
but
there
came
a
point
when
i
could
no
longer
listen
to
dora
harris
s
theories
to
account
for
him
wild
idealizations
as
most
of
them
were
of
any
man
s
circumstances
and
intentions
why
don
t
you
ask
him
i
said
and
she
replied
frowning
slightly
oh
i
couldn
t
do
that
it
would
destroy
something
i
don
t
know
what
but
something
valuable
between
this
struck
me
as
an
exaggeration
considering
how
far
by
that
time
they
must
have
progressed
towards
intimacy
and
my
mouth
was
opened
she
heard
me
without
the
exclamations
i
expected
her
head
bent
over
the
pencil
she
was
sharpening
and
her
silence
continued
after
i
had
finished
the
touch
of
comedy
i
gave
the
whole
thing
surely
i
was
justified
in
that
fell
flat
and
i
extracted
from
her
muteness
a
sense
of
rebuke
one
would
think
i
had
been
taking
advantage
of
the
poor
devil
at
last
having
broken
the
lead
of
her
pencil
three
times
she
turned
a
calm
considering
eye
upon
me
you
have
known
this
for
a
fortnight
she
asked
that
doesn
t
seem
somehow
quite
to
whom
i
asked
and
her
answer
startled
me
to
either
of
us
she
said
how
she
advised
herself
to
that
effect
is
more
than
i
can
imagine
but
the
print
of
her
words
is
indelible
that
is
what
she
said
oh
confound
it
i
exclaimed
i
couldn
t
help
finding
out
you
but
you
could
help
keeping
it
to
yourself
in
that
in
that
base
way
she
replied
and
almost
the
evening
light
was
beginning
to
glimmer
uncertainly
through
the
deodars
i
could
swear
i
saw
the
flash
of
a
tear
on
her
eyelid
i
beg
your
pardon
she
went
on
a
moment
later
but
i
do
hate
having
to
pity
him
it
s
intolerable
i
picked
up
a
dainty
edition
of
aucassin
and
nicolette
with
the
intention
of
getting
upon
ground
less
emotional
and
observed
on
the
flyleaf
from
in
memory
of
the
hill
of
i
looked
appreciatively
at
the
binding
and
as
soon
as
possible
put
it
down
he
was
not
bound
to
tell
me
dora
asserted
presently
in
reply
to
my
statement
that
the
mare
had
somehow
picked
up
a
nail
in
the
stable
and
was
laid
up
you
have
been
very
good
to
him
i
said
i
think
he
his
reticence
was
due
she
continued
as
if
defying
contradiction
to
a
simple
dislike
to
bore
one
with
his
personal
was
it
i
assented
my
tone
acknowledged
with
all
humility
that
she
was
likely
to
know
and
i
did
not
deserve
her
doubtful
glance
he
could
not
certainly
she
went
on
with
firmer
decision
have
been
in
the
least
ashamed
of
his
connection
with
he
comes
from
a
country
where
social
distinctions
are
less
sharp
than
they
are
in
this
idiotic
place
i
observed
oh
if
you
think
it
is
from
any
lack
of
recognition
his
sensitiveness
is
beyond
reason
he
has
met
two
or
three
men
in
the
military
department
here
he
was
aware
of
the
nicest
shade
of
their
patronage
but
he
does
not
care
to
him
life
is
more
than
a
clerkship
he
sees
all
round
people
like
that
they
are
only
figures
in
the
then
i
said
he
is
not
at
all
concerned
that
nobody
in
this
capua
of
ours
knows
him
or
cares
anything
about
him
or
has
bought
a
scrap
of
his
work
except
our
two
that
s
a
different
matter
i
have
tried
to
rouse
in
him
the
feeling
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
be
appreciated
even
in
simla
and
i
think
i
ve
succeeded
he
said
after
those
two
men
had
gone
away
on
sunday
that
he
thought
a
certain
reputation
in
the
place
where
he
lived
would
help
anybody
in
his
on
sunday
do
you
mean
between
twelve
and
two
yes
he
came
and
made
a
formal
call
there
was
no
reason
why
he
shouldn
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
rejoined
he
shot
a
card
on
me
too
at
the
club
i
was
a
little
surprised
we
didn
t
seem
somehow
to
be
on
those
terms
one
doesn
t
readily
associate
him
with
any
there
s
no
reason
why
he
shouldn
t
said
dora
again
and
with
this
vague
comment
we
spoke
of
something
else
both
of
us
i
think
a
little
disquieted
and
dissatisfied
that
he
had
i
think
dora
said
as
i
went
away
that
you
had
better
go
up
to
the
studio
and
tell
him
what
you
have
told
me
perhaps
it
doesn
t
matter
much
but
i
can
t
bear
the
thought
of
his
not
come
to
kauffer
s
in
the
morning
and
see
the
pictures
i
urged
but
she
turned
away
oh
not
with
i
found
my
way
almost
at
once
to
amy
villa
not
only
because
i
had
been
told
to
go
there
i
wanted
myself
certain
satisfactions
armour
was
alone
and
smoking
but
i
had
come
prepared
against
the
contingency
of
one
of
his
cigars
they
were
the
cigars
of
the
man
who
doesn
t
know
what
he
eats
with
sociable
promptness
i
lighted
one
of
my
own
the
little
enclosed
veranda
testified
to
a
wave
of
fresh
activity
the
north
light
streamed
in
upon
two
or
three
fresh
canvases
the
place
seemed
full
of
enthusiasm
and
you
could
see
its
source
at
present
quiescent
under
the
influence
of
tobacco
in
armour
s
face
you
have
taken
a
new
line
i
said
pointing
to
a
file
of
camels
still
half
obscured
by
the
dust
of
the
day
coming
along
a
mountain
road
under
a
dim
moon
they
might
have
been
walking
through
time
and
through
history
it
was
a
queer
simple
thing
with
a
world
of
early
aryanism
in
it
does
that
say
anything
i
m
glad
it
was
to
me
articulate
but
i
didn
t
know
oh
things
have
been
going
well
with
me
lately
those
two
studies
over
there
simply
did
themselves
that
camp
scene
on
the
left
is
almost
a
picture
i
think
i
ll
put
a
little
more
work
on
it
and
give
it
a
chance
in
paris
i
got
in
once
you
know
champ
de
mars
with
some
did
you
indeed
i
said
i
asked
him
if
he
didn
t
atrociously
miss
the
life
of
the
quarter
and
he
surprised
me
by
saying
that
he
never
had
lived
it
he
had
been
en
pension
instead
with
a
dear
old
professor
of
chemistry
and
his
family
at
puteaux
and
used
to
go
in
and
out
a
smile
came
into
his
eyes
at
the
remembrance
and
he
told
me
one
after
the
other
idyllic
little
stories
of
the
old
professor
and
madame
madame
and
the
omelet
madame
and
the
melon
vibois
and
the
maire
i
sat
charmed
so
long
as
we
remained
in
france
his
humour
was
like
this
delicate
and
expansive
but
an
accidental
allusion
led
us
across
the
channel
when
he
changed
he
had
no
little
stories
of
the
time
he
spent
in
england
instead
he
let
himself
go
in
generalizations
aimed
for
they
had
a
distinct
animus
at
english
institutions
and
character
particularly
as
these
appear
in
english
society
i
could
not
believe
from
the
little
i
had
seen
of
him
that
his
experience
of
english
society
of
any
degree
had
been
intimate
what
he
said
had
the
flavour
of
radical
sunday
papers
the
only
original
element
was
the
feeling
behind
which
was
plainly
part
of
him
speculation
instantly
clamoured
as
to
how
far
this
was
purely
temperamental
and
how
far
the
result
of
painful
contact
he
himself
he
said
though
later
of
the
western
states
had
been
born
under
the
british
flag
of
british
parents
though
his
mother
was
an
irishwoman
she
came
from
loyal
ulster
and
he
repeated
the
statement
as
if
it
in
some
way
justified
his
attitude
towards
his
fellow
countrymen
and
excused
his
truculence
in
the
ear
of
a
servant
of
the
empire
which
he
had
the
humour
to
abuse
i
heard
him
i
confess
with
impatience
it
was
all
so
shabby
and
shallow
but
i
heard
him
out
and
i
was
rewarded
he
came
for
an
illustration
in
the
end
to
simla
look
he
said
at
what
they
call
their
government
house
list
and
look
at
strobo
signor
strobo
isn
t
strobo
a
man
of
intelligence
isn
t
he
a
man
of
benevolence
he
gave
ten
thousand
rupees
last
week
to
the
famine
fund
is
strobo
on
government
house
list
is
he
ever
invited
to
dine
with
the
viceroy
no
because
strobo
keeps
a
hotel
look
at
rosario
where
does
rosario
come
in
nowhere
because
rosario
is
a
clerk
and
a
subordinate
yet
rosario
is
a
man
of
wide
reading
and
a
very
accomplished
fellow
it
became
more
or
less
necessary
to
argue
then
and
the
commonplaces
with
which
i
opposed
him
called
forth
a
wealth
of
detail
bearing
most
picturesquely
upon
his
stay
among
us
i
began
to
think
he
had
never
hated
english
rigidity
and
english
snobbery
until
he
came
to
simla
and
that
he
and
strobo
and
rosario
had
mingled
their
experiences
in
one
bitter
cup
i
gathered
this
by
inference
only
he
was
curiously
watchful
and
reticent
as
to
anything
that
had
happened
to
him
personally
indeed
he
was
careful
to
aver
preferences
for
the
society
of
sincere
people
like
strobo
and
rosario
that
seemed
to
declare
him
more
than
indifferent
to
circles
in
which
he
would
not
meet
them
in
the
end
our
argument
left
me
ridiculously
irritated
it
was
simply
distressing
to
see
the
platform
from
which
he
obtained
so
wide
and
exquisite
a
view
of
the
world
upheld
by
such
flimsy
pillars
and
my
nerves
were
not
soothed
by
his
proposal
to
walk
with
me
to
the
club
i
could
hardly
refuse
it
however
and
he
came
along
in
excellent
spirits
having
effected
the
demolition
of
british
social
ideals
root
and
branch
his
mongrel
dog
accompanied
keeping
offensively
near
our
heels
it
was
not
even
an
honest
pi
but
a
dog
of
tawdry
pretensions
with
a
tail
dishonestly
got
from
a
spaniel
on
one
occasion
i
very
nearly
kicked
the
dog
chapter
the
fact
is
i
said
to
dora
as
we
rode
down
to
the
gymkhana
his
personality
takes
possession
of
one
i
constantly
go
to
that
little
hut
of
his
with
intentions
benevolent
or
otherwise
which
i
never
carry
you
mean
she
answered
that
you
completely
forgot
to
reveal
to
him
your
hateful
knowledge
about
on
the
contrary
i
didn
t
forget
it
for
a
moment
but
the
conversation
took
a
turn
that
made
it
quite
impossible
to
i
can
understand
miss
harris
replied
softly
how
that
might
be
and
it
doesn
t
in
the
least
matter
she
went
on
triumphantly
because
i
ve
told
him
my
nerves
must
have
been
a
trifle
strung
up
at
the
time
for
this
struck
me
as
a
matter
for
offense
you
thought
i
would
trample
upon
him
i
exclaimed
no
no
really
i
disliked
his
not
knowing
it
was
known
rien
de
plus
she
said
lightly
what
did
he
say
oh
not
much
what
should
he
say
he
might
have
expressed
a
decent
regret
on
poor
kauffer
s
account
i
growled
dora
did
not
reply
and
a
glance
showed
her
frowning
i
believe
he
apologized
i
cried
pushing
as
it
were
my
advantage
he
oh
of
course
he
hasn
t
relished
the
position
and
of
course
he
didn
t
realize
it
before
he
came
shall
we
trot
i
was
compelled
to
negative
the
idea
of
trotting
since
we
were
descending
quite
the
steepest
pitch
of
the
road
down
to
annandale
we
went
on
at
a
walk
and
it
occurred
to
me
as
my
contemplative
gaze
fell
on
my
own
that
we
were
even
for
simla
an
uncommonly
pair
i
had
helped
to
pick
dora
s
hack
and
i
allowed
myself
to
reflect
that
he
did
my
judgment
credit
she
sat
him
perfectly
in
her
wrath
she
was
plainly
angry
not
a
hair
out
of
place
why
is
it
that
a
lady
out
of
temper
with
her
escort
always
walks
away
from
him
is
her
horse
sympathetic
ronald
at
all
events
was
leading
by
a
couple
of
yards
when
suddenly
he
shied
bounding
well
across
the
road
the
mare
whose
manners
i
can
always
answer
for
simply
stopped
and
looked
haughtily
about
for
explanations
a
path
dropped
into
the
road
from
the
hillside
something
came
scrambling
and
stumbling
down
oh
cried
dora
as
it
emerged
and
was
armour
on
his
much
enduring
white
pony
how
you
frightened
us
why
don
t
you
stick
to
the
road
man
i
exclaimed
it
isn
t
usual
to
put
ponies
up
and
down
these
coolie
tracks
he
took
no
notice
of
this
rather
broad
hint
that
i
was
annoyed
but
fixed
his
eager
light
luminous
eyes
upon
dora
i
m
sorry
he
said
and
added
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
today
not
till
tomorrow
she
returned
you
remember
that
we
are
sketching
tomorrow
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
slightly
and
then
i
remember
noticing
that
his
full
arched
upper
lip
seldom
quite
met
its
counterpart
over
his
teeth
this
gave
an
unpremeditated
casual
effect
to
everything
he
found
to
say
and
made
him
look
a
dreamer
at
his
busiest
his
smile
was
at
the
folly
of
her
reminder
i
ve
just
been
looking
for
something
that
you
would
like
he
said
but
it
isn
t
much
good
hunting
about
alone
i
see
five
times
as
much
when
we
go
he
and
his
pony
barred
the
way
he
had
an
air
of
leisure
and
of
felicity
one
would
think
we
had
met
at
an
afternoon
party
we
are
on
our
way
i
explained
to
the
gymkhana
miss
harris
is
in
one
of
the
events
you
did
enter
for
the
race
didn
t
you
with
lord
arthur
i
think
we
must
get
a
slow
dull
red
mounted
to
armour
s
face
and
seemed
to
put
out
that
curious
light
in
his
eyes
is
it
far
he
asked
glancing
down
over
the
i
ve
never
been
why
cried
dora
suddenly
you
ve
been
down
so
you
have
i
confirmed
her
your
beast
is
damaged
oh
it
was
only
a
stumble
armour
replied
i
stuck
on
all
well
i
said
you
had
better
get
off
now
as
you
didn
t
then
and
look
at
your
animal
s
near
fore
the
swelling
s
as
big
as
a
bun
again
he
made
me
no
answer
but
looked
intently
and
questioningly
at
dora
get
off
armour
she
said
sharply
and
lead
your
horse
home
it
is
not
fit
to
be
ridden
i
have
no
doubt
he
did
it
but
neither
of
us
were
inclined
to
look
back
to
see
we
pushed
on
under
the
deodars
and
i
was
indulgent
to
a
trot
at
the
end
of
it
dora
remarked
that
armour
naturally
could
not
be
expected
to
know
anything
about
riding
it
was
very
plucky
of
him
to
get
on
a
horse
at
all
among
these
precipices
and
i
of
course
agreed
lord
arthur
was
waiting
when
we
arrived
on
his
chestnut
polo
pony
but
dora
immediately
scratched
for
the
brilliant
event
in
which
they
were
paired
ronald
she
said
was
simply
cooked
with
the
heat
ronald
had
come
every
yard
of
the
way
on
his
toes
and
was
fit
for
anything
but
lord
arthur
did
not
insist
there
were
young
ladies
in
simla
i
am
glad
to
say
who
appealed
more
vividly
to
his
imagination
than
dora
harris
did
and
one
of
them
speedily
replaced
her
a
young
amazon
who
was
staying
at
the
chief
s
she
wandered
about
restlessly
over
the
dry
turf
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
went
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
little
wooden
grand
stand
and
sent
me
for
a
cup
of
tea
won
t
you
come
to
the
tent
i
asked
a
little
ruefully
eyeing
the
distance
and
the
possible
collisions
between
but
she
shook
her
head
i
simply
couldn
t
bear
it
she
said
and
i
went
feeling
somehow
chastened
myself
by
the
cloud
that
was
upon
her
spirit
i
found
her
on
my
return
regarding
the
scene
with
a
more
than
usually
critical
eye
and
a
more
than
usually
turned
down
lip
yet
it
was
exactly
the
scene
it
always
was
and
always
probably
will
be
i
sat
down
beside
her
and
regarded
it
also
but
more
charitably
than
usual
perhaps
it
was
rather
trivial
just
a
lot
of
pretty
dresses
and
excited
young
men
in
white
doing
foolish
things
on
ponies
in
the
shortest
possible
time
with
one
little
crowd
about
the
club
s
refreshment
tent
and
another
about
the
staff
s
while
the
hills
sat
round
in
an
indifferent
circle
but
it
appealed
to
me
with
a
kind
of
family
feeling
that
afternoon
and
inspired
me
with
tolerance
even
benevolence
after
all
i
said
it
s
mainly
youth
and
high
spirits
two
good
things
and
one
knows
them
and
who
are
they
to
know
complained
dora
just
decent
young
englishmen
and
englishwomen
out
here
on
their
country
s
business
i
replied
cheerfully
with
the
marks
of
oxford
and
cambridge
and
sandhurst
and
woolwich
on
the
men
youngsters
who
know
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
oh
i
like
the
breed
i
wonder
said
she
in
a
tone
of
preposterous
melancholy
if
eventually
i
have
to
marry
one
of
not
necessarily
i
said
she
looked
at
me
with
interest
as
if
i
had
contributed
importantly
to
the
matter
in
hand
and
resumed
tapping
her
boot
with
her
we
talked
of
indifferent
things
and
had
long
lapses
at
the
close
of
one
effort
dora
threw
herself
back
with
a
deep
tumultuous
sigh
the
poverty
of
this
little
wretched
resort
ties
up
one
s
tongue
she
cried
it
is
the
bottom
of
the
cup
here
one
gets
the
very
dregs
of
simla
s
commonplace
let
us
climb
out
of
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
ronald
had
been
too
much
for
her
nerves
coming
down
and
offered
to
change
saddles
but
she
would
not
we
took
it
out
of
the
horses
all
along
the
first
upward
slopes
and
as
we
pulled
in
to
breathe
them
she
turned
to
me
paler
than
ever
i
feel
better
now
she
said
for
myself
i
had
got
rid
of
armour
for
the
afternoon
i
think
my
irritation
with
him
about
his
pony
rose
and
delivered
me
from
the
too
insistent
thought
of
him
with
dora
it
was
otherwise
she
had
dismissed
him
but
he
had
never
left
her
for
a
moment
the
whole
long
afternoon
she
flung
a
searching
look
at
me
with
a
reckless
turn
of
her
head
she
said
why
didn
t
we
take
him
with
us
did
we
want
him
i
asked
i
think
i
always
want
ah
said
i
and
would
have
pondered
this
statement
at
some
length
in
silence
but
that
she
plainly
did
not
wish
me
to
do
so
we
might
perfectly
well
have
sent
his
pony
home
with
one
of
our
own
servants
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
walk
he
wasn
t
in
proper
kit
i
remonstrated
oh
i
wish
you
would
speak
to
him
about
that
make
him
get
some
and
do
you
propose
to
get
him
asked
to
places
i
inquired
she
gave
me
a
charmingly
unguarded
smile
i
propose
to
induce
you
to
do
so
i
have
done
what
i
could
he
has
dined
with
us
several
times
and
met
a
few
people
who
would
i
thought
be
kind
to
oh
well
i
said
i
have
had
him
at
the
club
too
with
old
lamb
and
colonel
hamilton
he
made
us
all
miserable
with
his
shyness
don
t
ask
me
to
do
it
again
i
ve
sent
him
to
call
on
certain
people
dora
continued
and
i
ve
shown
his
pictures
to
everybody
and
praised
him
and
talked
about
him
but
i
can
t
go
on
doing
that
indefinitely
can
i
no
i
said
people
might
i
don
t
think
they
would
misunderstand
replied
this
astonishing
girl
without
flinching
she
even
sought
my
eyes
to
show
me
that
hers
were
clear
and
full
of
purpose
good
god
i
said
to
myself
but
the
words
that
fell
from
me
were
he
is
outside
all
that
what
is
the
use
of
living
a
life
that
he
is
outside
of
oh
if
you
put
it
that
way
i
said
and
set
my
teeth
i
will
do
what
i
she
held
out
her
hand
with
an
affectionate
gesture
and
i
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
press
it
the
horses
broke
into
a
trot
and
we
talked
no
more
of
armour
or
of
anything
until
ted
harris
joined
us
on
the
mall
i
have
rendered
this
conversation
with
dora
in
detail
because
subsequent
events
depend
so
closely
upon
it
some
may
not
agree
that
it
was
basis
enough
for
the
action
i
thought
well
to
take
i
can
only
say
that
it
was
all
i
was
ever
able
to
obtain
dora
was
always
particularly
civil
and
grateful
about
my
efforts
but
she
gave
me
only
one
more
glimpse
and
that
enigmatic
of
any
special
reason
why
they
should
be
made
perhaps
this
was
more
than
compensated
for
by
the
abounding
views
i
had
of
the
situation
as
it
lay
with
ingersoll
armour
but
of
that
other
persons
approaching
the
subject
without
prejudice
will
doubtless
judge
better
than
i
chapter
it
was
better
not
to
inquire
so
i
never
knew
to
what
extent
kauffer
worked
upon
the
vanity
of
ancient
houses
the
sinful
dodge
i
suggested
to
him
but
i
heard
before
long
that
the
line
of
armour
s
rejected
efforts
had
been
considerably
diminished
armour
told
me
himself
that
kauffer
s
attitude
had
become
almost
conciliatory
that
kauffer
had
even
hinted
at
the
acceptance
of
and
adhesion
to
certain
principles
which
he
would
lay
down
as
the
basis
of
another
year
s
contract
in
talking
to
me
about
it
armour
dwelt
on
these
absurd
stipulations
only
as
the
reason
why
any
idea
of
renewal
was
impossible
it
was
his
proud
theory
with
me
that
to
work
for
a
photographer
was
just
as
dignified
as
to
produce
under
any
other
conditions
provided
you
did
not
stoop
to
ideals
which
for
lack
of
a
better
word
might
be
called
photographic
how
he
represented
it
to
dora
or
permitted
dora
to
represent
it
to
him
i
am
not
so
certain
i
imagine
there
may
have
been
admissions
and
qualifications
be
that
as
it
may
however
the
fact
was
imperative
that
only
three
months
of
the
hated
bond
remained
and
that
some
working
substitute
for
the
hated
bond
would
have
to
be
discovered
at
their
expiration
simla
in
short
must
be
made
to
buy
armour
s
pictures
to
appreciate
them
if
the
days
of
miracle
were
not
entirely
past
but
to
buy
them
any
way
on
one
or
two
occasions
i
had
already
made
simla
buy
things
i
had
cleared
out
young
ludlow
s
stables
for
him
in
a
week
he
had
a
string
of
ten
when
he
played
polo
in
a
straw
hat
and
had
to
go
home
with
sunstroke
and
i
once
auctioned
off
all
the
property
costumes
of
the
amateur
dramatic
society
at
astonishing
prices
pictures
presented
difficulties
which
i
have
hinted
at
in
an
earlier
chapter
but
i
did
not
despair
i
began
by
hauling
old
lamb
puffing
and
blowing
like
a
grampus
up
to
amy
villa
filling
him
up
all
the
way
with
denunciations
of
simla
s
philistinism
and
suggestions
that
he
alone
redeemed
it
it
is
a
thing
i
am
ashamed
to
think
of
and
it
deserved
its
reward
lamb
criticized
and
patronized
every
blessed
thing
he
saw
advised
armour
to
beware
of
mannerisms
and
to
be
a
little
less
liberal
with
his
colour
and
heard
absolutely
unmoved
of
the
horses
armour
had
got
into
the
salon
i
understand
he
said
with
a
benevolent
wink
that
about
four
thousand
pictures
are
hung
every
year
at
the
salon
and
i
don
t
know
how
many
thousand
are
rejected
let
armour
get
a
picture
accepted
by
the
academy
then
he
will
have
something
to
talk
neither
did
sir
william
lamb
buy
anything
at
all
the
experiment
with
lady
pilkey
was
even
more
distressing
she
gushed
with
fair
appropriateness
and
great
liberality
and
finally
fixed
upon
one
scene
to
make
her
own
she
winningly
asked
the
price
of
it
she
had
never
known
anybody
who
did
not
understand
prices
poor
armour
the
colour
of
a
live
coal
named
one
hundred
rupees
one
hundred
rupees
oh
my
dear
boy
i
can
never
afford
that
you
must
you
must
really
give
it
to
me
for
it
will
break
my
heart
if
i
can
t
have
it
for
give
me
the
pleasure
said
armour
of
making
you
a
present
of
it
you
have
been
so
kind
about
everything
and
it
s
so
seldom
one
meets
anybody
who
really
cares
so
let
me
send
it
to
it
was
honest
embarrassment
he
did
not
mean
to
be
impertinent
and
she
did
blum
of
the
geological
department
herr
blum
in
his
own
country
came
up
and
honestly
rejoiced
and
at
end
of
an
interminable
pipe
did
purchase
a
little
breton
bit
that
i
hated
to
see
go
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
gave
the
place
its
air
but
blum
had
a
large
family
undergoing
education
at
heidelberg
and
exclaimed
to
armour
s
keenest
anguish
that
on
this
account
he
could
not
more
do
altogether
during
the
months
of
august
and
september
persons
resident
in
simla
drawing
their
income
from
her
majesty
bought
from
the
eccentric
young
artist
from
nowhere
living
on
summer
hill
canvases
and
little
wooden
panels
to
the
extent
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
lady
pilkey
had
asked
him
to
lunch
she
might
well
and
he
had
appeared
at
three
and
a
picnic
it
was
not
enough
it
was
not
enough
and
yet
it
was
in
a
manner
too
much
pitiful
as
it
was
in
substance
it
had
an
extraordinary
personal
effect
armour
suddenly
began
to
turn
himself
out
well
his
apparel
was
of
smarter
cut
than
mine
and
his
neckties
in
better
taste
little
elegances
appeared
in
the
studio
he
offered
you
scotch
in
a
venetian
decanter
and
melachrinos
from
a
chased
silver
box
the
farouche
element
faded
out
of
his
speech
his
ideas
remained
as
fresh
and
as
simple
as
ever
but
he
gave
them
a
form
bless
me
that
might
have
been
used
at
the
club
he
worked
as
hard
as
ever
but
more
variously
he
tried
his
hand
at
several
new
things
he
said
he
was
feeling
about
for
something
that
would
really
make
his
reputation
in
spite
of
all
this
his
little
measure
of
success
made
him
more
contemptuous
than
before
of
its
scene
and
its
elements
he
declared
that
he
had
a
poorer
idea
than
ever
of
society
now
that
he
saw
the
pattern
from
the
smart
side
that
his
convictions
on
this
head
survived
one
of
the
best
simla
tailors
shows
that
they
must
always
have
been
strong
i
think
he
believed
that
he
was
doing
all
that
he
did
do
to
make
himself
socially
possible
with
the
purpose
of
pleasing
dora
harris
i
would
not
now
venture
to
say
how
far
dora
inspired
and
controlled
him
in
this
direction
and
how
far
the
impulse
was
his
own
the
measure
of
appreciation
that
began
to
seek
his
pictures
poor
and
small
though
it
was
gave
him
on
the
other
hand
the
most
unalloyed
delight
he
talked
of
the
advice
of
sir
william
lamb
as
if
it
were
anything
but
that
of
a
pompous
old
ass
and
he
made
a
feast
with
champagne
for
blum
that
must
have
cost
him
quite
as
much
as
blum
paid
for
the
breton
sketch
he
confirmed
my
guess
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
until
he
came
to
simla
sold
anything
so
that
even
these
small
transactions
were
great
things
to
him
and
the
earnest
of
a
future
upon
which
he
covered
his
eyes
not
to
gaze
too
raptly
he
mentioned
to
me
that
kauffer
had
been
asked
for
his
address
who
could
it
possibly
be
and
looked
so
damped
by
my
humourous
suggestion
that
it
was
a
friend
of
kauffer
s
in
some
other
line
who
wanted
a
bill
paid
that
i
felt
i
had
been
guilty
of
brutality
and
all
the
while
the
quality
of
his
wonderful
output
never
changed
or
abated
pure
and
firm
and
prismatic
it
remained
i
found
him
one
day
at
the
very
end
of
october
with
shining
eyes
and
fingers
blue
with
cold
putting
the
last
of
the
afternoon
light
on
the
snows
into
one
of
the
most
dramatic
hill
pictures
i
ever
knew
him
to
do
he
seemed
intoxicated
with
his
skill
and
hummed
the
marseillaise
i
remember
all
the
way
to
amy
villa
whither
i
accompanied
him
it
was
the
last
day
of
kauffer
s
contract
and
besides
all
the
world
secretaries
establishments
hill
captains
grass
widows
shops
and
sundries
was
trundling
down
the
hill
i
came
to
ask
my
young
friend
what
he
meant
to
do
do
he
cried
why
eat
drink
and
be
merry
kauffer
has
paid
up
and
his
yoke
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
come
back
and
dine
with
me
the
hour
we
spent
together
in
his
little
inner
room
before
dinner
was
served
stands
out
among
my
strangest
loveliest
memories
of
armour
he
was
divinely
caught
up
and
absurd
as
it
is
to
write
he
seemed
to
carry
me
with
him
we
drank
each
a
glass
of
vermouth
before
dinner
sitting
over
a
scented
fire
of
deodar
branches
while
outside
the
little
window
in
front
of
me
the
lifted
lines
of
the
great
empty
himalayan
landscape
faded
and
fell
into
a
blur
i
remembered
the
solitary
scarlet
dahlia
that
stood
between
us
and
the
vast
cold
hills
and
held
its
colour
when
all
was
grey
but
that
the
hill
world
waited
for
the
winter
down
a
far
valley
we
could
hear
a
barking
deer
armour
talked
slowly
often
hesitating
for
a
word
of
the
joy
there
was
in
beauty
and
the
divinity
in
the
man
who
saw
it
with
his
own
eyes
i
have
read
notable
pages
that
brought
conviction
pale
beside
that
which
stole
about
the
room
from
what
he
said
the
comment
may
seem
fantastic
but
it
is
a
comment
i
caressed
the
dog
the
servant
clattered
in
with
the
plates
and
at
a
shout
outside
armour
left
me
he
came
in
radiant
with
signor
strobo
also
radiant
and
carrying
a
violin
for
was
not
the
signor
s
only
accomplishment
i
knew
strobo
well
many
a
special
dish
had
he
ordered
for
my
little
parties
and
we
met
at
armour
s
fireside
like
the
genial
old
acquaintances
we
were
another
voice
without
and
presently
i
was
nodding
to
rosario
and
vaguely
wondering
why
he
looked
uncomfortable
i
m
sorry
said
armour
as
we
sat
down
i
ve
got
nothing
but
beer
if
i
had
known
you
were
all
coming
no
vintage
that
crawls
up
the
hill
would
have
been
good
enough
for
he
threw
the
bond
of
his
wonderful
smile
round
us
as
we
swallowed
his
stuff
and
our
hearts
were
lightened
you
fellows
he
went
on
nodding
at
the
other
two
might
happen
any
day
but
my
friend
john
philips
comes
to
me
across
aerial
spaces
he
is
a
star
i
ve
trapped
you
don
t
do
that
often
pilsener
john
philips
or
black
he
was
helping
his
only
servant
by
pouring
out
the
beer
himself
and
as
i
declared
for
black
he
slapped
me
affectionately
on
the
back
and
said
my
choice
was
good
the
last
person
who
had
slapped
me
on
the
back
was
lord
dufferin
and
i
smiled
softly
and
privately
at
the
remembrance
and
what
a
difference
there
was
i
had
resented
dufferin
s
slap
we
had
spiced
hump
and
and
a
normandy
cheese
everybody
will
understand
that
but
how
shall
i
make
plain
with
what
exultation
and
simplicity
we
ate
and
drank
how
the
four
candid
selves
of
us
sat
around
the
table
in
a
cloud
of
tobacco
and
cheered
each
other
on
armour
always
far
in
front
turning
handsprings
as
he
went
scraps
come
back
to
me
but
the
whole
queer
night
has
receded
and
taken
its
place
among
those
dreams
that
insist
at
times
upon
having
been
realities
rosario
told
us
stories
kipling
might
have
coveted
of
the
under
life
of
port
said
strobo
talked
with
glorious
gusto
of
his
uncle
the
brigand
they
were
liberated
men
we
were
all
liberated
men
let
the
direction
go
cried
armour
and
give
the
senses
flight
taking
the
image
as
it
comes
beating
the
air
with
happy
he
must
have
been
talking
of
his
work
but
i
can
not
now
remember
and
what
made
strobo
say
of
life
and
art
i
have
waited
for
ten
years
and
five
thousand
pounds
now
my
old
violin
says
go
handle
the
ladle
go
add
up
the
account
and
did
we
really
discuss
the
chances
of
ultimate
salvation
for
souls
in
the
secretariat
i
know
i
lifted
my
glass
once
and
cried
i
a
slave
drink
to
freedom
and
rosario
clinked
with
me
and
strobo
played
wailing
hungarian
airs
with
sudden
little
shakes
of
hopeless
laughter
in
them
i
can
not
even
now
hear
naches
without
being
filled
with
the
recollection
of
how
certain
bare
branches
in
me
that
night
blossomed
i
walked
alone
down
the
hill
and
along
the
three
miles
to
the
club
and
at
every
step
the
tide
sank
in
me
till
it
cast
me
on
my
threshold
at
three
in
the
morning
just
the
shell
of
a
secretary
to
the
government
of
india
that
i
was
when
i
set
forth
next
day
when
my
head
clerk
brought
me
the
files
we
avoided
one
another
s
glances
and
it
was
quite
three
weeks
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
address
him
with
the
dignity
and
distance
prescribed
for
his
station
as
rosario
chapter
i
went
of
course
to
calcutta
for
the
four
winter
months
harris
and
i
were
together
at
the
club
it
was
the
year
i
remember
of
the
great
shindy
as
to
whether
foreign
consuls
should
continue
to
be
made
honourary
members
in
view
of
the
sentiments
some
of
them
were
freely
reflecting
from
europe
upon
the
subject
of
a
war
in
south
africa
which
was
none
of
theirs
certainly
feeling
as
they
did
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
swaggered
less
about
a
club
that
stood
for
british
government
but
i
did
not
vote
to
withdraw
the
invitation
we
can
not
after
all
take
notice
of
every
idle
word
that
drops
from
latin
or
teutonic
tongues
it
isn
t
our
way
but
it
was
a
liverish
cold
weather
on
various
accounts
and
the
public
temper
was
short
i
heard
from
dora
oftener
harris
declared
than
he
did
she
was
spending
the
winter
with
friends
in
agra
and
armour
of
course
was
there
too
living
at
laurie
s
hotel
and
painting
dora
assured
me
with
immense
energy
it
was
just
the
place
for
armour
a
sumptuous
dynasty
wrecked
in
white
marble
and
buried
in
desert
sands
for
three
hundred
years
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
he
was
making
the
most
of
it
it
was
quite
by
the
way
but
i
had
lent
him
the
money
to
go
there
somebody
had
to
lend
it
to
him
and
when
he
asked
me
to
decide
whether
he
should
take
his
passage
for
marseilles
or
use
it
for
this
other
purpose
i
could
hardly
hesitate
believing
in
him
as
i
did
to
urge
him
to
paint
a
little
more
of
india
before
he
went
i
frankly
despaired
of
his
ever
being
able
to
pay
his
way
in
simla
without
kauffer
but
that
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
make
a
few
more
notes
for
further
use
at
home
where
i
sometimes
saw
for
him
when
his
desultory
and
experimental
days
were
over
and
some
definiteness
and
order
had
come
into
his
work
a
bond
street
exhibition
i
have
not
said
all
this
time
what
i
thought
of
ingersoll
armour
and
dora
harris
together
because
their
connection
seemed
too
vague
and
fantastic
and
impossible
to
hold
for
an
instant
before
a
steady
gaze
i
have
no
wish
to
justify
myself
when
i
write
that
i
preferred
to
keep
my
eyes
averted
enjoying
perhaps
just
such
a
measure
of
vision
as
would
enter
at
a
corner
of
them
this
may
or
may
not
have
been
immoral
under
the
circumstances
the
event
did
not
prove
it
so
but
for
urgent
private
reasons
i
could
not
be
the
person
to
destroy
the
idyll
if
indeed
its
destruction
were
possible
that
flourished
there
in
the
corner
of
my
eye
besides
had
not
i
myself
planted
and
watered
it
but
it
was
foolish
to
expect
other
people
people
who
are
forever
on
the
lookout
for
trousseaux
and
and
who
considered
these
two
as
mere
man
and
maid
and
had
no
sight
of
them
as
engaging
young
spirits
in
happy
conjunction
it
was
foolish
to
expect
such
people
to
show
equal
consideration
christmas
was
barely
over
before
the
lady
with
whom
miss
harris
was
staying
found
it
her
duty
to
communicate
to
edward
harris
the
fact
that
dear
dora
s
charming
friendship
she
was
sure
it
was
nothing
more
with
the
young
artist
poulton
believed
harris
would
understand
who
was
meant
was
exciting
a
good
deal
of
comment
in
the
station
and
would
dear
harris
please
write
to
dora
himself
as
poulton
was
beginning
to
feel
so
responsible
i
saw
the
letter
harris
showed
it
to
me
when
he
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
long
face
of
a
man
in
a
domestic
difficulty
and
we
settled
together
whom
we
should
ask
to
put
his
daughter
up
in
calcutta
it
should
be
the
wife
of
a
man
in
his
own
department
of
course
it
is
to
one
s
deputy
secretary
that
one
looks
for
succour
at
times
like
this
and
naturally
one
never
looks
in
vain
symons
would
be
delighted
i
conjured
up
dora
s
rage
on
receipt
of
the
telegram
she
loathed
the
symonses
she
came
but
not
at
the
jerk
of
a
wire
she
arrived
a
week
later
with
a
face
of
great
propriety
and
a
smile
of
great
unconcern
harris
having
got
her
effectually
out
of
harm
s
way
shirked
further
insistence
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
armour
was
never
even
mentioned
between
them
dora
applied
herself
to
the
gaieties
of
the
season
with
the
zest
of
a
debutante
she
seemed
really
refreshed
revitalized
she
had
never
looked
better
happier
i
met
her
again
for
the
first
time
at
one
of
the
thursday
dances
at
government
house
in
the
glance
she
gave
me
i
was
glad
to
detect
no
suspicion
of
collusion
she
plainly
could
not
dream
that
edward
harris
in
his
nefarious
exercise
of
parental
authority
had
acted
upon
any
hint
from
me
it
was
rather
sweet
out
in
the
veranda
away
from
the
blare
of
the
viceroy
s
band
she
told
me
very
delicately
and
with
the
most
charming
ellipses
how
armour
had
been
filling
her
life
in
agra
how
it
had
all
been
for
these
two
a
dream
and
a
vision
there
is
a
place
below
the
bridge
there
where
the
cattle
come
down
from
the
waste
pastures
across
the
yellow
sands
to
drink
and
stand
in
the
low
water
of
the
jumna
to
stand
and
switch
their
tails
while
their
herdsmen
on
the
bank
coax
them
back
with
ari
ari
ari
long
and
high
faint
and
musical
and
the
minarets
of
akbar
s
fort
rise
beyond
against
the
throbbing
sky
and
the
sun
fills
it
all
this
place
i
shall
never
see
more
distinctly
than
i
saw
it
that
night
on
the
veranda
at
government
house
calcutta
with
the
conviction
like
a
margin
for
the
picture
that
its
foreground
had
been
very
often
occupied
by
the
woman
i
profoundly
worshiped
and
ingersoll
armour
she
told
me
that
he
had
sent
me
a
sketch
of
it
and
i
very
much
wished
he
hadn
t
one
felt
that
the
gift
would
carry
a
trifle
of
irony
he
has
told
me
she
said
once
brusquely
how
good
you
have
been
to
is
he
coming
to
simla
again
i
asked
oh
yes
and
please
take
it
from
me
that
this
time
he
will
conquer
the
place
he
has
undertaken
to
do
at
your
request
at
my
persuasion
at
my
long
entreaty
they
must
recognize
him
they
must
be
taught
i
have
set
my
heart
on
does
he
himself
very
much
care
i
asked
remembering
the
night
of
the
of
october
yes
he
does
care
he
despises
it
of
course
but
in
a
way
he
cares
i
ve
been
trying
to
make
him
care
more
a
human
being
isn
t
an
orchid
he
must
draw
something
from
the
soil
he
grows
if
he
were
stable
i
mused
if
he
had
a
fixed
ambition
somewhere
in
the
firmament
but
his
purpose
is
a
i
think
he
has
an
ambition
said
miss
harris
into
the
dark
ah
then
we
must
continue
i
said
continue
to
push
from
dora
did
not
reply
she
is
a
person
of
energy
and
determination
and
might
have
been
expected
to
offer
to
cooperate
gladly
but
she
didn
t
he
is
painting
a
large
picture
for
next
season
s
exhibition
she
informed
me
i
was
not
allowed
to
see
it
or
to
know
anything
about
it
but
he
declares
it
will
bring
simla
i
hope
not
i
said
piously
oh
i
hope
so
i
have
told
him
dora
continued
slowly
that
a
great
deal
depends
on
here
is
symons
i
was
able
to
return
and
i
am
afraid
she
is
looking
for
march
came
and
the
city
lay
white
under
its
own
dust
the
electric
fans
began
to
purr
in
the
club
and
lent
brought
the
flagging
season
to
a
full
stop
i
had
to
go
that
year
on
tour
through
the
famine
district
with
the
member
and
we
escaped
gasping
from
the
plains
about
the
middle
of
april
simla
was
crimson
with
rhododendron
blossoms
and
seemed
a
spur
of
arcady
there
had
been
the
usual
number
of
flittings
from
one
house
to
another
and
among
them
i
heard
with
satisfaction
that
armour
no
longer
occupied
amy
villa
i
would
not
for
the
world
have
blurred
my
recollections
of
that
last
evening
i
could
not
have
gone
there
again
he
is
staying
with
sir
william
lamb
said
dora
handing
me
my
cup
of
tea
and
i
am
quite
jealous
sir
william
only
sir
william
has
been
allowed
to
see
the
exhibition
what
does
that
portend
i
said
thoughtfully
i
don
t
know
sir
william
was
here
yesterday
simply
swelling
with
his
impression
of
it
he
says
it
s
the
finest
thing
that
has
been
done
in
india
i
told
you
he
would
conquer
you
did
and
without
thinking
i
added
i
hope
you
won
t
be
sorry
that
you
asked
him
it
must
have
been
an
inspiration
armour
those
weeks
before
the
exhibition
seemed
invisible
dora
reported
him
torn
with
the
incapacity
of
the
bazaar
to
follow
a
design
and
otherwise
excessively
occupied
and
there
was
no
lack
of
demands
upon
my
own
time
besides
my
ardour
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
young
man
found
a
slight
damper
in
the
fact
that
he
was
staying
with
sir
william
lamb
what
competence
had
i
to
be
of
use
to
the
guest
of
sir
william
lamb
i
do
not
for
a
moment
think
he
will
be
there
said
dora
on
the
day
of
the
private
view
as
we
went
along
the
mall
towards
the
town
hall
together
he
will
not
run
with
an
open
mouth
to
his
success
he
will
take
it
from
us
but
he
was
there
we
entered
precisely
at
the
dramatic
moment
of
his
presentation
by
sir
william
lamb
to
the
viceroy
he
stood
embarrassed
and
smiling
in
a
little
circle
of
compliments
and
congratulation
behind
him
and
a
little
to
the
left
hung
his
picture
large
and
predominant
and
in
the
corner
of
the
frame
was
stuck
the
red
ticket
that
signified
the
viceroy
s
gold
medal
we
saw
that
i
think
before
we
saw
anything
else
then
with
as
little
haste
as
was
decent
considering
his
excellency
s
proximity
we
walked
within
range
of
the
picture
i
am
not
particularly
pleased
even
now
to
have
the
task
of
describing
the
thing
its
subject
was
an
old
mahomedan
priest
with
a
green
turban
and
a
white
beard
exhorting
a
rabble
of
followers
i
heard
myself
saying
to
dora
that
it
was
very
well
painted
indeed
very
conscientiously
painted
and
that
is
certainly
what
struck
me
the
expression
of
the
s
face
was
extremely
characteristic
his
arm
was
flung
out
with
a
gesture
that
perfectly
matched
the
group
of
listeners
was
carefully
composed
and
most
naturally
that
is
the
only
word
that
would
come
to
me
i
glanced
almost
timidly
at
dora
she
was
regarding
it
with
a
deep
vertical
line
between
her
handsome
brows
what
on
earth
has
he
done
with
himself
she
demanded
but
before
i
could
reply
armour
was
by
our
side
well
he
said
looking
at
dora
it
it
s
very
nice
she
stammered
but
i
miss
she
only
means
you
know
i
rushed
in
that
you
ve
put
in
everything
that
was
never
there
before
accuracy
of
detail
you
know
and
so
forth
pon
my
word
there
s
some
drawing
in
that
no
said
dora
calmly
what
i
complain
of
is
that
he
has
left
out
everything
that
was
there
before
but
he
has
won
the
gold
medal
and
i
congratulate
well
i
said
uneasily
don
t
congratulate
me
i
didn
t
do
it
positively
i
am
not
to
his
excellency
says
that
it
reminds
him
of
an
incident
in
one
of
steel
s
novels
said
armour
just
turning
his
head
to
ascertain
his
excellency
s
whereabouts
dear
me
so
it
does
i
exclaimed
eagerly
one
couldn
t
name
the
chapter
it
s
the
general
i
went
on
to
discourse
of
the
general
feeling
words
came
generously
questions
with
point
comments
with
intelligence
i
swamped
the
situation
and
so
carried
it
off
the
viceroy
has
bought
the
thing
armour
went
on
looking
at
dora
and
has
commissioned
me
to
paint
another
the
only
restriction
he
makes
is
that
it
shall
be
of
the
same
size
asked
dora
that
it
must
deal
with
some
phase
of
native
miss
harris
walked
to
a
point
behind
us
and
stood
there
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
picture
i
glanced
at
her
once
her
gaze
was
steady
but
perfectly
blank
then
she
joined
us
again
and
struck
into
the
stream
of
my
volubility
i
am
delighted
she
said
pleasantly
to
armour
you
have
done
exactly
what
i
wanted
you
to
do
you
have
won
the
viceroy
s
medal
and
all
the
reputation
there
is
to
win
in
this
place
come
and
dine
tonight
and
we
will
rejoice
together
but
wasn
t
it
for
you
a
little
difficult
he
looked
at
her
as
if
she
had
offered
him
a
cup
and
then
dashed
it
from
his
lips
but
the
occasion
was
not
one
of
course
for
crying
out
oh
no
he
said
putting
on
an
excellent
face
but
it
took
a
hideous
chapter
within
a
fortnight
i
was
surprised
and
a
little
irritated
to
receive
from
armour
the
amount
of
my
loan
in
full
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
my
preconceived
idea
of
him
that
he
should
return
it
at
all
i
had
arranged
in
my
own
mind
that
he
should
be
governed
by
the
most
honest
impulses
and
the
most
approved
intentions
up
to
the
point
of
departure
but
that
he
should
never
find
it
quite
convenient
to
pay
and
that
in
order
to
effect
his
final
shipment
to
other
shores
i
should
be
compelled
to
lend
him
some
more
money
in
the
far
future
when
he
should
be
famous
and
i
an
obscure
pauper
on
pension
my
generous
imagination
permitted
me
to
see
the
loan
repaid
but
not
till
then
these
are
perhaps
stereotyped
and
conventional
lines
to
conceive
him
on
but
i
hardly
think
that
anybody
who
has
followed
my
little
account
to
this
point
will
think
them
unjustifiable
i
looked
at
his
cheque
with
disgust
that
a
man
turns
out
better
than
you
expected
is
no
reason
why
you
such
not
be
annoyed
that
your
conception
of
him
is
shattered
you
may
be
gratified
on
general
grounds
but
distinctly
put
out
on
personal
ones
especially
when
your
conception
pointed
to
his
inevitable
removal
that
was
the
way
i
felt
the
cheque
stood
for
so
much
more
than
its
money
value
it
stood
for
a
possible
nay
a
probable
capacity
in
armour
to
take
his
place
in
the
stable
body
of
society
to
recognize
and
make
demands
to
become
a
taxpayer
a
churchgoer
a
householder
a
husband
as
i
gazed
the
signature
changed
from
that
of
a
gnome
with
luminous
eyes
who
inhabited
an
inaccessible
crag
among
the
rhododendrons
to
that
of
a
prosperous
with
a
silk
hat
for
sundays
i
have
in
some
small
degree
the
psychological
knack
i
saw
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
with
immense
clearness
and
i
cursed
the
cheque
coincidence
is
odious
tells
on
the
nerves
i
never
felt
it
more
so
than
a
week
later
when
i
read
in
the
pioneer
the
announcement
of
the
death
of
my
old
friend
fry
superintendent
of
the
school
of
art
in
calcutta
the
paragraph
in
which
the
journal
dismissed
poor
fry
to
his
reward
was
not
unkind
but
it
distinctly
implied
that
the
removal
of
fry
should
include
the
removal
of
his
ideas
and
methods
and
the
substitution
of
something
rather
more
up
to
date
it
remarked
that
the
bengali
student
had
been
pinned
down
long
enough
to
drawing
plaster
casts
and
declared
that
something
should
be
done
to
awake
within
him
the
creative
idea
i
remember
the
phrase
it
seemed
so
directly
to
suggest
that
the
person
to
awake
it
should
be
ingersoll
armour
i
turned
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
indeed
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
my
brain
revolved
with
little
else
the
billet
was
an
excellent
one
with
very
decent
pay
and
charming
quarters
it
carried
a
pension
it
was
the
completest
sort
of
provision
there
was
a
long
vacation
with
opportunities
for
original
effort
and
i
had
heard
fry
call
the
work
interesting
fry
was
the
kind
of
man
to
be
interested
in
anything
that
gave
him
a
living
but
there
was
no
reason
why
a
more
captious
spirit
in
view
of
the
great
advantages
should
not
accommodate
itself
to
the
routine
that
might
present
itself
the
post
was
in
the
gift
of
the
government
of
bengal
but
that
was
no
reason
why
the
government
of
bengal
should
not
be
grateful
in
the
difficulty
of
making
a
choice
for
a
hint
from
us
the
difficulty
was
really
great
they
would
have
to
write
home
and
advertise
in
the
athenaeum
for
some
reason
indian
governments
always
advertise
educational
appointments
in
the
athenaeum
it
is
a
habit
which
dates
from
the
days
of
john
company
and
that
would
mean
delay
and
then
the
result
might
be
a
disappointment
might
armour
not
also
be
a
disappointment
that
i
really
could
not
say
a
new
man
is
always
a
speculation
and
departments
like
individuals
have
got
to
take
their
luck
the
viceroy
was
so
delighted
everybody
was
so
delighted
with
the
medal
picture
that
the
merest
breath
blown
among
them
would
secure
armour
s
nomination
should
i
blow
that
breath
these
happy
thoughts
must
always
occur
to
somebody
this
one
had
occurred
to
me
ten
to
one
it
would
occur
to
nobody
else
and
last
of
all
to
armour
himself
the
advertisement
might
already
be
on
its
way
home
to
the
athenaeum
it
would
make
everything
possible
it
would
throw
a
very
different
complexion
over
the
idyll
it
would
turn
that
interlacing
wreath
of
laurels
and
of
poppies
into
the
strongest
bond
in
the
world
i
would
simply
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
there
was
no
harm
i
asking
armour
to
dine
with
me
i
sent
the
note
off
by
messenger
after
breakfast
and
told
the
steward
to
put
a
magnum
of
pommery
to
cool
at
seven
precisely
i
had
some
idea
i
suppose
of
drinking
with
armour
to
his
eternal
discomfiture
then
i
went
to
the
office
with
a
mind
cleared
of
responsibility
and
comfortably
pervaded
with
the
glow
of
good
intentions
the
moment
i
saw
the
young
man
punctual
and
immediate
and
a
little
uncomfortable
about
the
cuffs
i
regretted
not
having
asked
one
or
two
more
fellows
it
might
have
spoiled
the
occasion
but
it
would
have
saved
the
situation
that
single
glance
of
my
accustomed
eye
alas
that
it
was
so
well
accustomed
revealed
him
anxious
and
screwed
up
as
nervous
as
a
cat
but
determined
revealed
how
well
i
knew
the
signs
that
he
had
something
confidential
and
important
and
highly
personal
to
communicate
a
matter
in
which
i
could
if
i
only
would
be
of
the
greatest
possible
assistance
from
these
appearances
twenty
years
had
taught
me
to
fly
to
any
burrow
but
your
offers
no
retreat
you
are
hoist
so
to
speak
on
your
own
there
are
men
of
course
and
even
women
who
have
scruples
about
taking
advantage
of
so
intimate
and
unguarded
an
opportunity
but
armour
i
rapidly
decided
was
not
one
of
these
his
sophistication
was
progressing
but
it
had
not
reached
that
point
he
wanted
something
i
flew
instantly
to
the
mad
conclusion
that
he
wanted
dora
i
did
not
pause
to
inquire
why
he
should
ask
her
of
me
it
had
seemed
for
a
long
time
eminently
proper
that
anybody
who
wanted
dora
should
ask
her
of
me
the
application
was
impossible
but
applications
nearly
always
were
impossible
nobody
knew
that
better
than
the
secretary
to
the
government
of
india
in
the
home
department
i
squared
my
shoulders
and
we
got
through
the
soup
it
was
necessary
to
apologize
for
the
fish
i
suppose
one
must
remember
i
said
that
it
has
to
climb
six
thousand
feet
when
suddenly
he
burst
out
sir
william
lamb
tells
me
he
said
and
stopped
to
swallow
some
wine
that
there
is
something
very
good
going
in
calcutta
and
that
i
should
ask
you
to
help
me
to
get
it
may
i
so
the
miserable
idea
the
happy
thought
had
occurred
to
somebody
else
is
there
i
said
with
interest
and
attention
it
s
something
in
the
school
of
art
a
man
named
fry
has
ah
i
said
a
man
named
fry
he
i
think
was
director
of
that
i
looked
at
armour
in
the
considering
measuring
way
with
which
we
suggest
to
candidates
for
posts
that
their
fitness
to
fill
them
is
not
to
be
absolutely
taken
for
granted
fry
was
a
man
of
i
said
i
am
he
certainly
did
not
look
it
but
years
often
fall
lightly
upon
a
temperament
it
s
a
vile
i
know
is
it
too
vile
do
you
think
he
said
anxiously
to
ask
a
lady
to
share
lots
of
ladies
do
share
it
i
replied
with
amazing
calmness
but
i
must
decline
absolutely
to
enter
into
my
frown
was
so
forbidding
that
he
couldn
t
and
didn
t
dare
to
go
on
he
looked
dashed
and
disappointed
he
was
really
a
fool
of
an
applicant
quite
ready
to
retire
from
the
siege
on
the
first
intimation
that
the
gates
were
not
to
be
thrown
open
at
his
approach
do
you
think
you
would
like
teaching
i
asked
i
can
teach
miss
my
only
pupil
here
has
made
capital
i
am
afraid
you
must
not
measure
the
bengali
art
student
by
the
standard
of
miss
harris
i
replied
coldly
he
was
a
fool
we
talked
of
other
things
i
led
him
on
to
betray
his
ludicrous
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
world
in
various
directions
at
other
times
it
had
irritated
me
that
night
it
gave
me
purest
pleasure
i
agreed
with
him
about
everything
as
he
selected
his
smoke
to
go
home
with
i
said
send
your
application
in
to
the
director
of
public
instruction
bengal
lamb
will
tell
you
how
and
i
ll
see
what
i
can
they
were
only
too
thankful
to
get
him
as
a
student
it
seemed
he
had
been
diligent
both
in
london
and
paris
he
possessed
diplomas
or
some
such
things
bearing
names
which
were
bound
to
have
weight
with
a
department
of
public
instruction
anywhere
i
felt
particularly
thankful
for
this
for
i
was
committed
to
him
if
he
had
not
a
rag
to
show
the
matter
was
settled
in
three
weeks
during
which
armour
became
more
and
more
the
fashion
in
simla
he
was
given
every
opportunity
of
experiment
in
the
society
of
which
he
was
about
to
become
a
permanent
item
he
dined
out
four
or
five
times
a
week
and
learned
exactly
what
to
talk
about
he
surprised
me
one
day
with
a
piece
of
news
of
my
own
department
which
was
a
liberty
of
a
very
serious
kind
but
i
forgave
him
upon
finding
that
it
was
not
true
he
rode
lamb
s
to
cross
which
his
short
legs
were
barely
adequate
and
apart
from
this
disadvantage
he
did
not
ride
them
badly
only
one
thing
marred
the
completeness
of
the
transformation
he
didn
t
dismiss
the
dog
the
dog
fundamentally
was
still
and
ever
his
companion
it
was
a
suspicious
circumstance
if
we
had
known
but
we
saw
in
it
only
a
kind
heart
and
ignored
it
i
saw
little
of
dora
harris
at
this
time
making
no
doubt
that
she
was
enjoying
her
triumph
as
she
deserved
i
took
the
liberty
of
supposing
that
she
would
hardly
wish
to
share
so
intimate
a
source
of
satisfaction
i
met
them
both
several
times
at
people
s
houses
certain
things
had
apparently
been
taken
for
granted
but
i
was
only
one
of
the
little
circle
that
wondered
how
soon
it
might
venture
upon
open
congratulations
the
rest
of
us
knew
as
much
it
seemed
as
edward
harris
did
lady
pilkey
asked
him
and
he
said
what
his
daughter
found
to
like
in
the
fellow
the
lord
only
knew
and
he
was
glad
to
say
that
at
present
he
had
no
announcement
to
make
lady
pilkey
told
me
she
thought
it
very
romantic
like
marrying
a
newspaper
correspondent
but
i
pointed
to
a
lifelong
task
with
a
pension
attached
of
teaching
fat
young
bengalis
to
draw
and
asked
her
if
she
saw
extravagant
romance
in
that
they
wrote
up
from
calcutta
that
they
would
like
to
have
a
look
at
armour
before
making
the
final
recommendation
and
he
left
us
i
remember
by
the
mail
tonga
of
the
third
of
june
he
dropped
into
my
office
to
say
goodbye
but
i
was
busy
with
the
member
and
could
see
nobody
so
he
left
a
card
with
on
it
i
kept
the
card
by
accident
and
i
keep
it
still
by
design
for
the
sake
of
that
inscription
strobo
had
given
up
his
hotel
in
simla
to
start
one
in
calcutta
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
armour
might
go
to
strobo
s
but
it
was
of
course
the
natural
thing
for
him
to
do
especially
as
strobo
happened
to
be
in
calcutta
himself
at
the
time
he
went
and
stayed
with
strobo
and
every
day
he
and
the
signor
clad
in
lay
in
closed
rooms
under
punkahs
and
had
iced
drinks
in
the
long
tumblers
of
the
east
and
smoked
and
talked
away
the
burden
of
the
hours
strobo
was
in
calcutta
to
meet
a
friend
an
austrian
who
was
shortly
leaving
india
in
the
messagerie
maritimes
steamer
dupleix
after
agreeable
wanderings
disguised
as
a
fakir
in
tibet
and
to
this
friend
was
attached
in
what
capacity
i
never
thought
well
to
inquire
a
lady
who
was
a
pole
and
played
and
sang
as
well
as
strobo
fiddled
i
believe
they
dined
together
every
night
this
precious
quartet
and
exchanged
in
various
tongues
their
impressions
of
india
under
british
control
a
houri
in
stays
the
lady
who
was
a
pole
described
it
i
believe
she
herself
was
a
houri
without
them
and
at
midnight
when
the
south
wind
was
cool
and
strong
from
the
river
strobo
and
armour
would
walk
up
chowringhee
road
and
look
at
the
red
brick
school
of
art
from
the
outside
in
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
as
a
preliminary
to
our
friend
s
final
acceptance
of
the
task
of
superintending
it
from
within
we
in
simla
of
course
knew
nothing
of
all
this
at
the
time
the
details
leaked
out
later
when
strobo
came
up
again
i
began
to
feel
some
joyful
anxiety
when
in
a
letter
dated
a
week
after
armour
s
arrival
in
calcutta
the
director
of
public
instruction
wrote
to
inquire
whether
he
had
yet
left
simla
but
the
sweet
blow
did
not
fall
with
any
precision
or
certainty
until
the
newspaper
arrived
containing
his
name
immediately
under
that
of
herr
vanrig
and
mme
dansky
in
the
list
of
passengers
who
had
sailed
per
dupleix
on
the
fifteenth
of
june
for
colombo
there
it
was
i
armour
as
significant
as
ever
to
two
persons
intimately
concerned
with
it
but
no
longer
a
wrapping
of
mystery
rather
a
radiating
centre
of
light
its
power
of
illumination
was
such
that
it
tried
my
eyes
i
closed
them
to
recall
the
outlines
of
the
school
of
art
it
had
been
built
in
a
fit
of
economy
and
the
headings
of
the
last
director
s
report
which
i
had
kindly
sent
after
armour
to
calcutta
perhaps
that
had
been
the
last
straw
the
real
meaning
of
the
task
of
implanting
western
ideals
in
the
eastern
mind
rose
before
me
when
i
thought
of
armour
s
doing
it
how
they
would
dwindle
in
the
process
and
how
he
must
go
on
handling
them
and
looking
at
them
withered
and
shrunken
for
years
i
understood
there
was
enough
left
in
me
to
understand
armour
s
terrified
escape
i
was
happy
in
the
thought
of
him
sailing
down
the
bay
the
possibilities
of
marriage
social
position
assured
income
support
in
old
age
the
strands
in
the
bond
that
held
him
the
bond
that
holds
us
all
had
been
untwisting
untwisting
from
the
third
of
june
to
the
fifteenth
the
strand
that
stood
for
dora
doubtless
was
the
last
to
break
but
it
did
not
detract
from
my
beatitude
to
know
that
even
this
consideration
before
the
dupleix
and
liberty
failed
to
hold
i
kept
out
of
miss
harris
s
way
so
studiously
for
the
next
week
or
two
that
she
was
kind
enough
in
the
end
to
feel
compelled
to
send
for
me
i
went
with
misgivings
i
expected
as
may
be
imagined
to
be
very
deeply
distressed
she
met
me
with
a
storm
of
gay
reproaches
i
had
never
seen
her
in
better
health
or
spirits
my
surprise
must
have
been
more
evident
than
i
supposed
or
intended
for
before
i
went
away
she
told
me
the
whole
story
by
that
time
she
had
heard
from
ceylon
a
delicious
letter
with
a
sketch
at
the
top
i
have
it
still
it
infallibly
brought
the
man
back
to
me
but
it
was
all
over
she
assured
me
with
shining
eyes
that
it
was
the
reason
of
her
plainly
boundless
thankfulness
that
armour
had
run
away
from
the
school
of
art
did
not
come
to
the
surface
until
i
was
just
going
then
i
gathered
that
if
he
had
taken
the
post
she
would
have
felt
compelled
compelled
by
all
she
had
done
for
him
to
share
its
honours
with
him
and
this
ever
since
at
her
bidding
he
had
begun
to
gather
such
things
up
was
precisely
what
she
had
lost
all
inclination
to
do
we
were
married
the
following
october
we
had
a
big
gorgeous
official
wedding
which
we
both
enjoyed
enormously
i
took
furlough
and
we
went
home
but
we
found
london
very
expensive
and
the
country
very
slow
and
with
my
came
the
offer
of
the
membership
so
we
went
back
to
simla
for
three
perfectly
unnecessary
years
which
we
now
look
back
upon
with
pleasure
and
regret
i
fear
that
we
no
more
than
ingersoll
armour
were
quite
bohemians
but
i
don
t
know
that
we
really
ever
pretended
to
be
the
hesitation
of
miss
anderson
chapter
when
it
became
known
that
madeline
anderson
had
finally
decided
to
go
abroad
for
two
years
her
little
circle
in
new
york
naturally
talked
a
good
deal
in
review
about
her
curious
reason
for
never
having
gone
before
so
much
that
happened
afterward
so
much
that
i
am
going
to
tell
depends
upon
this
reason
for
not
going
before
that
i
also
must
talk
about
it
and
explain
it
i
could
never
bring
it
out
just
as
we
went
along
it
would
have
been
a
curious
reason
in
connection
with
anybody
but
doubly
so
as
explaining
the
behaviour
of
miss
anderson
whose
profile
gave
you
the
impression
that
she
was
anything
but
the
shuttlecock
of
her
emotions
shortly
her
reason
was
a
convict
number
who
up
to
february
in
that
year
had
been
working
or
rather
waiting
out
his
sentence
in
the
state
penitentiary
so
long
as
he
worked
or
waited
madeline
remained
in
new
york
but
when
in
february
death
gave
him
his
quittance
she
took
her
freedom
too
with
wide
intentions
and
many
coupons
earlier
in
his
career
number
had
been
known
in
new
york
society
as
frederick
prendergast
and
for
a
little
while
he
was
disapproved
there
on
the
score
of
having
engaged
himself
to
a
miss
anderson
madeline
anderson
whom
nobody
knew
anything
about
there
was
her
own
little
circle
as
i
have
said
and
it
lacked
neither
dignity
nor
refinement
but
i
doubt
whether
any
member
of
it
was
valeted
from
london
or
could
imply
in
conversation
a
personal
acquaintance
with
yvette
guilbert
there
is
no
need
however
to
insist
that
there
are
many
persons
of
comfortable
income
and
much
cultivation
in
new
york
who
would
not
be
met
by
strangers
having
what
are
called
the
best
introductions
there
the
best
so
often
fails
to
include
the
better
it
may
be
accepted
that
madeline
anderson
and
her
people
were
of
these
and
that
she
wondered
sometimes
during
the
brief
days
of
her
engagement
what
it
would
be
like
to
belong
to
the
brilliant
little
world
about
her
that
had
its
visiting
list
in
london
paris
or
petersburg
and
was
immensely
entertained
by
the
gaucheries
of
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
then
came
with
the
most
unexceptionable
introductions
miss
violet
forde
from
a
sloane
square
address
london
she
came
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
brother
the
only
relative
she
had
in
the
world
and
so
brilliant
was
the
form
of
these
young
people
that
it
occurred
to
nobody
to
imagine
that
it
had
the
most
precarious
pecuniary
foundation
must
have
faded
and
shrivelled
indeed
after
another
year
or
two
of
anything
but
hospitality
as
generous
as
that
of
new
york
and
undimmed
however
it
concealed
for
them
admirably
the
fact
that
it
was
the
hospitality
they
were
after
and
not
the
bracing
climate
or
the
desire
to
see
the
fascinating
americans
of
london
and
paris
at
home
new
york
found
them
agreeable
specimens
of
young
english
people
and
played
with
them
indefinitely
miss
forde
when
she
sat
imperturbably
on
a
cushion
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
after
dinner
and
sang
to
a
guitar
the
songs
of
albert
chevalier
was
an
anomaly
in
english
decorum
that
was
as
pleasing
to
observe
as
it
was
amusing
to
criticize
the
americans
she
met
delighted
in
drawing
her
out
it
was
a
pastime
that
took
the
lead
at
to
an
extent
which
her
hostess
often
thought
preposterous
and
she
responded
with
naivete
and
vigour
perfectly
aware
that
she
was
scoring
all
along
the
line
upon
many
charming
people
she
made
the
impression
that
she
was
a
type
of
the
most
finished
class
of
what
they
called
english
society
girls
that
she
represented
the
best
they
could
do
over
there
in
this
direction
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
might
have
sat
to
any
of
those
black
and
white
artists
who
draw
townish
young
women
of
london
saying
cynical
things
to
young
men
in
the
weekly
papers
that
was
her
type
and
if
you
look
for
her
picture
there
you
will
see
that
her
face
was
very
accurately
oval
with
eyes
that
knew
their
value
and
other
features
that
didn
t
very
much
matter
except
in
so
far
as
they
expressed
a
very
full
conception
of
the
satisfactions
of
this
life
and
a
wide
philosophy
as
to
methods
of
obtaining
them
frederick
prendergast
was
unacquainted
with
the
popular
pictures
i
have
mentioned
having
a
very
reasonable
preference
for
the
illustrated
papers
of
his
own
country
otherwise
there
is
no
telling
he
might
have
observed
the
resemblance
and
escaped
the
state
prison
whither
he
assuredly
never
would
have
gone
had
he
married
madeline
anderson
as
he
fully
intended
to
do
when
miss
forde
came
over
he
was
worth
at
that
time
a
great
deal
of
money
besides
being
more
personable
than
any
one
would
have
believed
who
knew
him
as
his
fiancee
was
never
too
obtrusively
in
evidence
and
if
miss
forde
thought
of
miss
anderson
with
any
scruple
it
was
probably
to
reflect
that
if
she
could
not
take
care
of
these
things
she
did
not
deserve
to
have
them
this
at
all
events
was
how
her
attitude
expressed
itself
practically
and
the
upshot
was
that
miss
anderson
lost
them
there
came
a
day
when
frederick
prendergast
in
much
discomfort
of
mind
took
to
violet
the
news
that
madeline
had
brought
their
engagement
to
an
end
she
violet
gave
him
some
tea
and
they
talked
frankly
of
the
absurd
misconception
of
the
relations
between
them
upon
which
his
dismissal
was
founded
and
prendergast
went
away
much
comforted
and
wholly
disposed
to
respect
miss
anderson
s
startling
wishes
she
with
what
both
the
others
thought
excellent
taste
persuaded
her
mother
and
sister
to
move
to
brooklyn
and
so
far
as
the
thoroughfares
and
social
theatres
of
new
york
were
concerned
the
city
over
the
river
might
have
been
a
nunnery
which
had
closed
its
gates
upon
her
it
was
only
in
imagination
that
she
heard
frederick
prendergast
s
when
two
months
later
he
was
united
to
miss
forde
in
grace
church
and
that
after
the
fact
their
melody
being
brought
to
her
inner
sense
next
day
by
the
marriage
notice
in
the
tribune
it
would
be
painful
in
view
of
what
we
know
of
frederick
prendergast
to
dwell
upon
what
madeline
anderson
undeniably
felt
besides
her
emotions
were
not
destructively
acute
they
only
lasted
longer
than
any
one
could
have
either
expected
or
approved
she
suffered
for
him
as
well
she
saw
as
plainly
as
he
did
the
first
sordid
consequences
of
his
mistake
the
afternoon
he
came
to
solicit
her
friendship
having
lost
other
claims
and
it
was
then
perhaps
that
her
responsibility
in
allowing
violet
forde
to
spoil
his
life
for
him
began
to
suggest
itself
to
her
up
to
that
time
she
had
thought
of
the
matter
differently
as
she
would
have
said
selfishly
he
was
not
permitted
to
come
again
but
he
went
away
lightened
inasmuch
as
he
had
added
his
burden
to
hers
when
a
year
later
the
national
credit
involved
that
of
prendergast
s
firm
madeline
read
financial
articles
in
the
newspapers
with
heavy
concern
surprising
her
family
with
views
on
sound
money
and
when
shortly
afterward
his
partners
brought
that
unhappy
young
man
before
the
criminal
courts
for
an
irregular
use
of
the
firm
s
signature
which
further
involved
it
beyond
hope
of
extrication
there
was
no
moment
of
the
day
which
did
not
find
her
in
spirit
beside
him
there
the
case
dragged
on
through
appeal
and
the
decision
of
the
lower
courts
was
not
reversed
the
day
this
became
known
the
fact
also
transpired
that
poor
prendergast
would
never
live
to
complete
his
ten
years
term
of
imprisonment
he
went
to
prison
with
hardly
more
than
one
lung
and
in
the
most
favourable
physical
condition
to
get
rid
of
the
other
prendergast
wept
a
little
over
the
installation
and
assured
frederick
that
it
was
perfectly
absurd
they
were
certain
to
get
him
out
again
people
always
got
people
out
again
in
america
she
took
him
grapes
and
flowers
once
a
week
for
about
a
month
and
then
she
sailed
for
europe
she
put
it
about
that
her
stay
was
to
be
as
brief
as
was
consistent
with
the
transaction
of
certain
necessary
business
in
london
but
she
never
came
back
and
madeline
anderson
had
taken
her
place
in
so
far
as
the
grapes
and
flowers
were
concerned
for
many
months
when
the
announcement
of
his
wife
s
death
reached
prendergast
in
an
english
paper
published
in
paris
about
a
year
after
that
it
began
to
be
thought
singular
how
he
picked
up
in
health
and
madeline
s
mother
and
sister
occasionally
romanced
about
the
possibility
of
his
recovering
and
marrying
her
after
all
they
had
an
enormous
opinion
of
the
artistic
virtue
of
forgiveness
but
it
was
not
a
contingency
ever
seriously
contemplated
by
miss
anderson
herself
her
affection
pricked
on
by
remorse
had
long
satisfied
itself
with
the
duties
of
her
ministry
if
she
would
not
leave
him
until
he
died
it
was
because
there
was
no
one
but
herself
to
brighten
the
long
day
in
the
prison
hospital
for
him
because
she
had
thrown
him
into
the
arms
of
the
woman
who
had
deserted
him
because
he
represented
in
her
fancy
her
life
s
only
budding
towards
the
sun
her
patience
lasted
through
six
years
which
was
four
years
longer
than
any
doctor
had
given
frederick
prendergast
to
live
but
when
one
last
morning
she
found
an
empty
bed
and
learned
that
number
had
been
discharged
in
his
coffin
she
rose
from
the
shock
with
the
sense
of
a
task
fully
performed
and
a
desire
to
see
what
else
there
might
be
in
the
world
she
announced
her
intention
of
travelling
for
a
year
or
two
with
a
maid
and
her
family
expressed
the
usual
acquiescence
it
would
help
her
they
said
to
shake
it
off
but
they
said
that
to
one
another
they
were
not
aware
and
it
would
have
spoiled
an
ideal
for
them
if
they
had
been
that
she
had
shaken
it
off
quite
completely
into
prendergast
s
grave
this
was
the
curious
reason
why
miss
anderson
s
travels
were
so
long
postponed
chapter
it
was
madeline
s
fancy
to
enjoy
the
contrast
between
west
and
east
in
all
its
sharpness
so
she
and
brookes
embarked
at
san
francisco
for
yokohama
their
wanderings
in
japan
were
ideal
in
spite
of
brookes
s
ungrateful
statement
that
she
could
have
done
with
fewer
eggs
and
more
bacon
and
madeline
prolonged
the
appeal
of
the
country
to
her
sense
of
humour
and
fantasy
putting
off
her
departure
for
india
from
week
to
week
she
went
at
last
in
march
and
found
herself
down
with
fever
at
benares
in
the
middle
of
one
particularly
hot
april
two
months
after
the
last
of
her
fellow
travellers
had
sailed
from
bombay
haunted
on
her
baking
pillow
by
pictorial
views
of
the
burning
ghat
and
the
vultures
the
station
doctor
using
appalling
language
to
her
ordered
her
to
the
hills
and
thus
it
was
that
she
went
to
simla
where
she
had
no
intention
of
going
and
where
this
story
really
begins
brookes
has
always
declared
that
providence
in
sending
miss
anderson
to
simla
had
it
in
mind
to
prevent
a
tragedy
but
as
to
that
there
is
room
for
a
difference
of
opinion
besides
i
can
not
be
anticipated
by
brookes
it
s
the
oddest
place
imaginable
and
in
many
ways
the
most
delightful
madeline
wrote
to
her
sister
adele
this
microcosm
of
indian
official
society
withdrawn
from
all
the
world
and
playing
at
being
a
municipality
on
three
himalayan
mountaintops
you
can
t
imagine
its
individuality
its
airy
unsubstantial
superior
poise
how
can
i
explain
to
you
elderly
gentlemen
whose
faces
express
daily
electric
communications
with
the
secretary
of
state
playing
tennis
violently
every
single
afternoon
in
striped
flannels
writing
letters
of
admonition
to
the
amir
all
day
long
and
in
the
evening
with
the
assistance
of
yellow
wigs
and
sticks
from
the
calcutta
imagining
that
they
produce
things
poor
dears
only
a
little
less
well
done
than
is
done
at
the
lyceum
nothing
is
beyond
them
i
assure
you
they
are
contemplating
at
the
moment
the
second
tanqueray
the
effect
of
remoteness
from
the
world
i
suppose
and
the
enormous
mutual
appreciation
of
people
who
have
watched
each
other
climb
for
to
arrive
officially
at
simla
they
have
had
to
climb
in
more
ways
than
one
it
is
all
so
hilarious
so
so
young
and
yet
my
word
what
a
cult
of
official
dignity
underlying
i
saw
a
in
full
uniform
red
and
white
feathers
and
all
going
to
the
birthday
dinner
at
the
viceroy
s
the
other
evening
in
a
perambulator
rickshaw
you
know
such
as
they
have
in
japan
that
is
typical
of
the
place
all
the
honours
and
dignities
and
a
perambulator
to
put
them
in
or
a
ridiculous
little
house
made
of
mud
and
tin
and
calling
itself
warwick
castle
blenheim
abbotsford
they
haven
t
a
very
good
hold
these
simla
residences
and
sometimes
they
slip
fifty
yards
or
so
down
the
but
the
chimneys
bad
pun
coming
are
never
any
more
out
of
drawing
than
they
were
before
yet
never
forget
the
queer
little
place
has
a
nobility
drawn
i
suppose
from
high
standards
of
conduct
in
essentials
this
matter
of
precedence
is
a
bore
for
an
outsider
i
am
very
tired
of
being
taken
in
to
dinner
by
subalterns
because
i
have
no
official
something
of
the
kind
was
offered
me
by
the
way
the
other
day
by
a
little
gunner
with
red
eyelids
in
the
ordnance
department
named
mcdermott
captain
mcdermott
he
took
my
declining
very
cheerfully
said
he
knew
americans
didn
t
like
englishmen
who
hadn
t
been
taught
to
pronounce
their
g
s
but
hoped
i
would
change
my
mind
before
the
rains
when
he
was
goin
down
of
course
i
sha
n
t
the
red
eyelids
alone
i
am
living
in
a
precisely
under
the
deodars
and
have
tiffin
with
hauksbee
every
day
when
neither
of
us
are
having
it
anywhere
else
and
i
ve
been
told
the
original
of
general
bangs
that
most
immoral
you
remember
don
t
you
the
heliograph
incident
i
needn
t
quote
it
it
really
happened
and
the
general
still
lives
none
the
worse
perhaps
rather
greater
quite
half
the
people
seem
materializations
of
kipling
and
it
s
very
interesting
but
one
mustn
t
say
so
if
one
wants
to
be
popular
talking
of
materializations
i
saw
the
original
of
crawford
s
isaacs
too
the
other
day
he
used
to
be
a
diamond
agent
among
the
native
princes
when
crawford
knew
him
when
i
saw
him
he
was
auctioning
off
his
collection
of
curios
and
things
these
types
of
novelists
look
wonderfully
little
impaired
i
suppose
it
s
the
dry
air
brookes
is
also
quite
happy
she
was
much
struck
on
arriving
by
an
apparent
anomaly
in
nature
have
you
noticed
ma
am
said
she
how
at
this
height
all
the
birds
are
crows
and
monkeys
miss
anderson
described
simla
exhaustively
in
her
letters
to
new
york
she
touched
upon
almost
every
feature
from
mickie
and
gammidge
whose
husbands
were
perspiring
in
the
plains
and
nobody
telling
them
anything
to
the
much
larger
number
of
ladies
interested
in
the
work
of
the
young
women
s
christian
association
from
the
type
of
the
military
secretary
to
the
viceroy
to
that
of
ali
buksh
who
sold
raw
turquoises
in
a
little
carved
shop
in
the
bazaar
i
should
like
to
quote
more
of
her
letters
but
if
i
did
i
should
find
nothing
about
colonel
horace
innes
who
represented
she
often
acknowledged
to
herself
her
only
serious
interest
miss
anderson
took
the
world
at
its
own
light
valuation
as
it
came
but
she
had
a
scale
of
recognitions
and
acceptances
which
she
kept
apart
for
the
very
few
and
innes
had
claimed
a
place
in
it
the
first
time
they
met
it
seems
a
trifle
ungrateful
that
she
should
have
left
him
out
since
it
was
he
who
gave
her
a
standard
by
which
to
measure
the
frivolity
of
simla
he
went
to
gymkhanas
if
he
knew
she
was
going
but
he
towered
almost
pictorially
above
them
and
when
he
talked
to
madeline
his
shoulders
expressed
a
resentment
of
possible
interruptions
that
isolated
him
still
further
i
would
not
suggest
that
he
was
superior
by
conviction
he
was
only
intent
whereas
most
of
the
other
people
were
extremely
diffused
and
discriminating
while
the
intimacies
of
the
rest
were
practically
coextensive
with
government
house
list
neither
for
his
part
would
he
admit
that
the
tone
of
simla
was
as
wholly
flippant
as
i
have
implied
they
often
talked
about
it
he
recognized
it
as
a
feature
likely
to
compel
the
attention
of
people
from
other
parts
of
the
world
and
one
afternoon
he
asked
her
with
some
directness
if
she
could
see
no
tragedies
underneath
tragedies
of
the
heart
she
asked
oh
i
can
not
take
them
seriously
the
emotion
is
so
ephemeral
a
woman
came
to
tea
with
me
three
days
ago
and
made
me
her
confessor
it
was
unexpected
if
it
hadn
t
been
i
wouldn
t
have
asked
her
to
tea
she
was
so
unhappy
that
she
forgot
about
the
rouge
and
it
all
came
off
on
her
handkerchief
when
she
cried
the
man
likes
somebody
else
better
this
season
well
i
gave
her
nougat
and
cheap
cynicisms
and
she
allowed
herself
to
be
comforted
why
the
loves
of
are
more
they
were
riding
on
the
broad
road
blasted
out
of
the
rock
that
winds
round
jakko
the
deodars
stood
thick
above
them
with
the
sunlight
filtering
through
a
thousand
feet
below
lay
the
little
square
fields
yellow
and
green
of
the
king
of
koti
the
himalayas
shouldered
the
eye
out
to
the
horizon
and
there
the
snows
lifted
themselves
hardly
more
palpable
than
the
drifted
clouds
except
for
a
gleam
of
ice
in
their
whiteness
a
low
stone
wall
ran
along
the
verge
of
the
precipice
and
looking
down
they
saw
tangled
patches
of
the
white
wild
rose
of
the
himalayas
waving
and
drooping
over
the
abyss
i
am
afraid
said
innes
you
are
not
even
upon
the
fringe
of
the
it
s
the
situation
as
i
see
then
excuse
me
you
do
not
see
deep
enough
that
poor
lady
suffered
i
suppose
to
the
extent
of
her
capacity
you
would
not
have
have
increased
i
don
t
know
i
should
have
preferred
not
to
measure
besides
that
was
not
quite
the
sort
of
thing
i
had
in
mind
i
was
thinking
more
of
the
ah
said
madeline
it
s
not
fair
to
ask
women
to
live
much
in
india
sometimes
it
s
the
children
sometimes
it
s
ill
health
sometimes
it
s
natural
antipathy
to
the
place
there
s
always
a
reason
to
take
them
yes
said
madeline
turning
a
glance
of
scrutiny
on
him
his
face
was
impassive
he
was
watching
mechanically
for
a
chance
to
slay
a
teasing
green
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
tragedy
i
was
thinking
of
time
does
the
rest
time
and
the
aridity
of
separations
how
many
men
and
women
can
hold
themselves
together
with
letters
i
don
t
mean
aging
or
any
physical
change
i
don
t
mean
change
at
no
said
madeline
and
this
time
though
her
curiosity
was
greater
she
did
not
look
at
him
no
the
mind
could
accustom
itself
to
expect
that
and
so
forestall
the
blow
if
it
really
would
be
a
blow
which
i
doubt
for
myself
i
m
pretty
sure
that
nothing
of
that
kind
could
have
much
effect
upon
one
s
feeling
if
it
were
the
real
he
spoke
practically
to
himself
as
if
he
had
reasoned
this
out
many
times
oh
no
said
madeline
but
separation
can
do
a
worse
thing
than
that
it
can
reintroduce
people
having
deprived
them
of
their
mutual
illusion
under
which
they
married
if
they
lived
together
the
illusion
would
go
i
suppose
but
custom
and
comfort
would
step
in
to
prevent
a
jar
there
never
would
be
that
awful
revelation
of
he
stopped
sharply
and
the
hope
went
through
madeline
s
mind
that
her
face
expressed
no
personal
concern
for
him
there
was
a
small
red
stain
in
the
brown
of
his
cheek
as
he
looked
at
her
to
find
out
and
he
added
i
ve
known
in
bombay
one
or
two
bad
cases
of
that
but
of
course
it
is
the
wife
who
suffers
most
shall
we
canter
on
in
a
minute
said
madeline
and
he
drew
his
rein
again
she
could
not
let
this
be
the
last
word
he
must
not
imagine
that
she
had
seen
through
the
simple
crystal
of
his
convictions
the
personal
situation
that
gave
them
to
him
of
course
she
said
thoughtfully
you
know
the
world
and
i
don
t
you
must
have
observed
this
that
you
speak
of
it
it
sounds
only
too
probable
and
i
confess
it
makes
my
little
impression
very
vulgar
and
she
turned
her
head
and
a
candid
smile
to
him
all
the
same
i
fancy
that
the
people
who
are
capable
of
suffering
much
that
way
are
the
exceptions
and
i
don
t
care
i
believe
there
is
more
cheap
sentiment
in
this
place
than
the
other
kind
what
do
you
think
i
heard
a
woman
say
the
other
day
at
a
no
man
has
touched
my
heart
since
i
ve
been
married
she
proclaimed
except
my
husband
at
a
she
heard
the
relief
in
innes
s
laugh
and
was
satisfied
how
does
it
happen
he
said
that
women
nowadays
are
critical
of
the
world
so
young
i
shall
be
thirty
in
september
and
we
no
longer
look
at
society
through
a
she
said
hardily
and
i
shall
be
next
month
but
hitherto
i
have
known
it
to
produce
nothing
like
you
he
returned
and
if
there
was
ambiguity
in
his
phrase
there
was
none
in
his
face
miss
anderson
made
with
her
head
her
little
smiling
gesture
simla
called
it
very
american
which
expressed
that
all
chivalrous
speech
was
to
be
taken
for
granted
and
meant
nothing
whatever
and
as
they
turned
into
the
ladies
mile
gave
her
horse
his
head
and
herself
a
chance
for
meditation
she
thought
of
the
matter
again
that
evening
before
her
little
fire
of
snapping
deodar
twigs
thought
of
it
intently
she
remembered
it
all
with
perfect
distinctness
she
might
have
been
listening
to
a
telephonic
reproduction
it
was
the
almost
intimate
glimpse
innes
had
given
her
of
himself
and
it
brought
her
an
excitement
which
she
did
not
think
of
analyzing
she
wrung
from
every
sentence
its
last
possibility
of
unconscious
meaning
and
she
found
when
she
had
finished
that
it
was
eleven
o
clock
then
she
went
to
bed
preferring
not
to
call
brookes
with
the
somewhat
foolish
feeling
of
being
unable
to
account
for
her
evening
her
last
reflection
before
she
slept
shaped
itself
in
her
mind
in
definite
words
there
are
no
children
it
ran
and
her
health
has
always
been
good
he
says
she
must
have
left
him
after
that
first
six
months
in
lucknow
because
of
a
natural
antipathy
to
the
country
and
when
she
condescended
to
come
out
again
for
a
winter
he
met
the
different
lady
he
thinks
about
with
little
hard
lines
around
the
mouth
and
common
conventional
habits
of
thought
full
of
subservience
to
his
official
superiors
and
perfectly
uninterested
in
him
except
as
the
source
of
supplies
but
i
don
t
know
why
i
should
want
her
to
be
so
disagreeable
as
a
matter
of
fact
innes
travelling
at
the
moment
with
the
mails
from
london
to
bombay
was
hastening
to
present
to
miss
anderson
features
astonishingly
different
chapter
the
lady
guests
at
peliti
s
jack
owen
and
the
rest
were
giving
a
tea
in
the
hotel
pavilion
they
had
the
band
the
wife
of
the
the
governess
from
viceregal
lodge
and
one
little
viceregal
girl
three
s
one
member
of
council
and
the
archdeacon
these
were
the
main
features
moving
among
a
hundred
or
so
of
people
more
miscellaneous
who
like
the
ladies
at
peliti
s
had
come
up
out
of
the
seething
plains
to
the
paradise
of
the
summer
capital
the
pavilion
overhung
the
mall
looking
down
one
could
see
the
coming
and
going
of
leisurely
government
peons
in
scarlet
and
gold
cashmiri
vendors
of
great
bales
of
embroideries
and
skins
pahari
chaffering
in
groups
and
here
and
there
a
mounted
trotting
to
the
club
beyond
the
hills
dipped
blue
and
bluer
to
the
plains
and
against
them
hung
a
single
waving
yellow
laburnum
a
note
of
imagination
madeline
anderson
was
looking
at
it
when
mickie
and
gammidge
came
up
with
an
affectionate
observation
upon
the
cut
of
her
skirt
after
which
mickie
harked
back
to
what
they
had
been
talking
about
before
she
s
straight
enough
now
i
suppose
this
lady
said
she
goes
down
but
she
gives
people
a
good
deal
of
latitude
for
who
is
this
asked
madeline
i
ask
for
information
to
keep
out
of
her
way
i
find
i
am
developing
the
most
shocking
curiosity
i
must
be
in
a
position
to
check
the
ladies
exchanged
hardly
perceptible
glances
then
gammidge
said
mrs
innes
and
looked
as
if
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
she
would
withhold
further
judgment
but
you
mustn
t
avoid
the
poor
lady
put
in
mickie
simply
because
of
her
past
it
wouldn
t
be
fair
besides
her
past
madeline
made
one
little
effort
to
look
indifferent
and
then
let
the
question
leap
up
in
her
my
dear
said
gammidge
with
brief
impatience
he
married
her
in
cairo
and
she
was
dancing
there
case
of
chivalry
i
believe
though
there
are
different
versions
awful
row
in
the
regiment
he
had
to
take
a
year
s
leave
then
he
succeeded
to
the
command
and
the
were
ordered
out
here
she
came
with
him
to
lucknow
and
made
slaves
of
every
one
of
them
they
ll
swear
to
you
now
that
she
was
staying
at
shepheard
s
with
an
invalid
mother
when
he
met
her
and
now
she
s
accepted
like
everybody
else
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
there
s
nothing
in
that
said
madeline
determinedly
to
prove
that
she
wasn
t
n
no
of
course
not
and
again
the
eye
of
gammidge
met
that
of
mickie
though
you
see
love
added
the
latter
lady
it
would
have
been
nicer
for
his
people
they
ve
never
spoken
to
him
since
if
she
had
been
making
her
living
otherwise
in
as
a
barmaid
for
instance
said
madeline
sarcastically
as
a
barmaid
for
instance
repeated
gammidge
calmly
but
simla
isn
t
related
to
him
simla
doesn
t
care
mickie
exclaimed
everybody
will
be
as
polite
as
possible
when
she
turns
up
you
ll
see
you
knew
didn
t
you
that
she
was
coming
out
in
the
caledonia
no
said
madeline
she
looked
carefully
where
she
was
going
to
put
her
and
then
she
glanced
out
again
at
the
laburnum
hanging
over
the
plains
i
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
these
separations
you
take
so
lightly
out
here
are
miserable
the
other
ladies
did
not
exchange
glances
this
time
miss
anderson
s
change
of
tone
was
too
marked
for
comment
which
she
might
have
detected
colonel
innes
got
the
telegram
this
morning
she
wired
from
brindisi
gammidge
said
does
he
seem
pleased
asked
mickie
demurely
he
said
he
was
afraid
she
would
find
it
very
hot
coming
up
here
from
bombay
and
of
course
he
is
worried
about
a
house
when
a
man
has
been
living
for
months
at
the
club
of
course
poor
fellow
i
do
love
that
dear
old
colonel
innes
though
i
can
t
say
i
know
him
a
bit
he
won
t
take
the
trouble
to
be
nice
to
me
but
i
am
perfectly
certain
he
must
be
the
dearest
old
thing
inside
of
him
worth
any
dozen
of
these
little
that
run
round
after
rickshaws
said
mickie
with
candour
i
think
he
s
a
ridiculous
old
glacier
gammidge
remarked
and
mickie
looked
at
madeline
and
said
slap
her
what
for
asked
miss
anderson
with
composure
i
dare
say
he
is
occasionally
it
isn
t
a
bad
thing
to
be
i
should
think
in
indian
i
guess
you
got
it
that
time
dear
lady
said
mickie
to
gammidge
as
madeline
slipped
toward
the
door
meant
to
be
cross
did
she
how
silly
of
her
if
she
gives
her
little
heart
away
like
that
often
people
will
begin
to
make
the
worst
of
that
girl
is
mickie
continued
that
you
never
can
depend
upon
her
for
days
together
she
ll
be
just
as
giddy
and
jolly
as
anybody
and
then
suddenly
she
ll
give
you
a
nasty
superior
bit
of
ice
down
the
back
of
your
neck
like
that
i
ve
got
her
coming
to
tea
tomorrow
afternoon
mickie
added
with
sudden
gloom
and
little
lord
billy
and
all
that
set
are
coming
they
ll
throw
buns
at
each
other
i
know
they
will
what
in
heaven
s
name
made
me
ask
her
oh
she
ll
have
recovered
by
then
you
must
make
allowance
for
the
shock
we
gave
her
poor
dear
consider
how
you
would
feel
if
lady
worsley
suddenly
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
demanded
devotion
from
sir
she
wouldn
t
get
it
mickie
dimpled
candidly
frank
always
loses
his
heart
and
his
conscience
at
the
same
time
but
you
don
t
suppose
there
s
anything
serious
in
this
affair
pure
pretty
platonics
i
should
call
gammidge
lifted
her
eyebrows
i
dare
say
that
is
what
they
imagine
it
well
they
re
never
in
the
same
room
for
two
minutes
without
being
aware
of
it
and
their
absorption
when
they
get
in
a
corner
i
saw
her
keep
the
viceroy
waiting
the
other
night
after
dinner
while
colonel
innes
finished
a
sentence
and
then
she
was
annoyed
at
the
interruption
here
s
kitty
vesey
lookin
such
a
dog
hello
kitty
where
did
you
get
that
hat
where
did
you
get
that
tile
but
that
wasn
t
the
colour
of
your
hair
last
week
kitty
don
t
feel
any
kind
of
a
dog
vesey
s
pout
though
becoming
was
genuine
i
m
in
a
perfectly
furious
rage
my
dears
and
i
m
coming
home
to
cry
just
as
soon
as
i

had
an
ice
what
do
you
think
they
won
t
let
me
have
val
for
captain
wynne
s
part
in
the
outcast
pearl
they
say
he
s
been
tried
before
and
he
s
a
stick
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
brutes
they
want
me
to
act
with
major
dalton
and
he
s
much
too
old
for
the
kitten
said
mickie
with
conviction
valentine
drake
on
the
stage
would
be
fatal
to
your
affection
for
i
don
t
care
i
won
t
act
with
anybody
else
i
ll
throw
up
the
part

i
got
to
make
love
to
the
man
how
am
i
to
play
up
to
such
an
animal
as
major
dalton
i
shall
certainly
throw
up
the
don
t
do
anything
rash
kitty
if
you
do
they
ll
probably
offer
it
to
me
and
i
warn
you
i
won
t
give
it
back
to
oh
refuse
it
like
a
dear
i
am
dying
to
put
them

a
hole
it
s
jealousy
that

what
it
is
goodbye
jack
i
ve
had
a
lovely
time
val
and
i
have
been
explaining
our
affection
to
the
archdeacon
and
he
says
it
s
perfectly
innocent
we
re
going
to
get
him
to
put
it
on
paper
to
produce
when
jimmy
sues
for
a
divorce
aren
t
we
val
you

said
jack
owen
oh
yes
i
must
but
i
ve
enjoyed
myself
awfully
and
so
has
everybody
i
ve
been
talking
to
i
say
mickie
dear
about
tomorrow
afternoon
i
suppose
i
may
bring
val
oh
dear
yes
mickie
replied
but
you
must
let
me
hold
his
i
don
t
know
which
of
you
is
the
most
ridiculous
owen
remarked
i
shall
write
to
both
your
husbands
this
very
night
but
as
the
group
shifted
and
left
her
alone
with
gammidge
she
said
she
didn
t
know
whether
vesey
would
be
quite
so
chirpy
three
weeks
hence
when
innes
comes
out
she
added
in
explanation
oh
yes
valentine
drake
is
quite
her
property
my
own
idea
is
that
kitty
won
t
be
in
where
the
road
past
peliti
s
dips
to
the
mall
madeline
met
horace
innes
when
she
appeared
in
her
rickshaw
he
dismounted
and
gave
the
reins
to
his
syce
she
saw
in
his
eyes
the
look
of
a
person
who
has
been
all
day
lapsing
into
meditation
and
rousing
himself
from
it
you
are
very
late
she
said
as
he
came
up
oh
i
m
not
going
at
least
you
are
just
coming
away
aren
t
you
i
think
it
is
too
late
i
ll
turn
back
with
do
she
said
and
looked
at
his
capable
sensitive
hand
as
he
laid
it
on
the
side
of
her
little
carriage
miss
anderson
had
not
the
accomplishment
of
but
she
took
general
manual
impressions
she
had
observed
colonel
innes
s
hand
before
but
it
had
never
offered
itself
so
intimately
to
her
inspection
that
perhaps
was
why
the
conviction
seemed
new
to
her
as
she
thought
he
is
admirable
and
it
is
all
when
they
got
to
the
level
mall
he
kept
his
hold
which
was
a
perfectly
natural
and
proper
thing
for
him
to
do
walking
alongside
but
she
still
looked
at
it
i
have
heard
your
good
news
she
said
smiling
congratulation
at
him
my
good
news
oh
about
my
wife
of
course
yes
she
ought
to
be
here
by
the
end
of
the
month
i
thought
of
writing
to
tell
you
when
the
telegram
came
and
then
i
didn
t
the
files
drove
it
out
of
my
head
i
heavy
day
yes
he
said
absently
they
went
along
together
in
an
intimacy
of
silence
and
madeline
was
quite
aware
of
the
effort
with
which
she
said
i
shall
look
forward
to
meeting
it
was
plain
that
his
smile
was
perfunctory
but
he
put
it
on
with
creditable
alacrity
she
will
be
delighted
my
wife
is
a
clever
woman
he
went
on
very
bright
and
attractive
she
keeps
people
well
she
must
be
a
great
success
in
india
i
think
she
is
liked
she
has
a
tremendous
fund
of
humour
and
spirits
a
fellow
feels
terribly
dull
beside
her
madeline
cast
a
quick
glance
at
him
but
he
was
only
occupied
to
find
other
matters
with
which
he
might
commend
his
wife
she
is
very
fond
of
animals
he
said
and
she
sings
and
plays
well
really
extremely
that
must
be
charming
murmured
madeline
privately
iterating
he
doesn
t
mean
to
damn
her
he
doesn
t
mean
to
damn
have
you
a
photograph
of
her
quantities
of
them
he
said
with
simplicity
you
have
never
shown
me
one
but
how
could
you
she
added
in
haste
a
photograph
is
always
about
the
size
of
a
door
nowadays
it
is
simply
impossible
to
keep
one
s
friends
and
relations
in
a
pocketbook
as
one
used
to
they
might
have
stopped
there
but
some
demon
of
persistence
drove
madeline
on
she
besought
help
from
her
imagination
she
was
not
for
the
moment
honest
it
was
an
impulse
an
equivocal
impulse
born
doubtless
of
the
equivocal
situation
and
it
ended
badly
she
will
bring
something
of
the
spring
out
to
you
said
madeline
the
spring
in
england
how
many
years
is
it
since
you
have
seen
it
there
will
be
a
breath
of
the
cowslips
about
her
and
in
her
eyes
the
soft
wet
of
the
english
sky
oh
you
will
be
very
glad
to
see
the
girl
was
well
aware
of
her
insincerity
but
only
dimly
of
her
cruelty
she
was
drawn
on
by
something
stronger
than
her
sense
of
honesty
and
humanity
a
determination
to
see
to
know
that
swept
these
things
away
innes
s
hand
tightened
on
the
rickshaw
and
he
made
at
first
no
answer
then
he
said
she
has
been
staying
in
town
you
there
was
just
a
quiver
of
madeline
s
eyelid
it
said
nothing
of
the
natural
rapacity
behind
this
man
s
testimony
was
coming
out
in
throes
and
yet
it
must
be
said
again
she
probed
then
she
will
put
you
in
touch
again
she
cried
you
will
remember
when
you
see
her
all
the
vigour
of
great
issues
and
the
fascination
of
great
personalities
for
a
little
while
anyway
after
she
comes
you
will
be
in
a
world
far
away
from
here
where
people
talk
and
think
and
he
looked
at
her
in
wonder
not
understanding
as
indeed
how
could
he
why
he
said
you
speak
of
what
you
have
done
and
before
the
truth
of
this
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
turned
a
hot
deep
red
and
had
nothing
to
say
no
he
said
my
wife
is
not
like
he
walked
along
in
absorption
from
which
he
roused
himself
with
resentment
in
his
voice
i
can
not
leave
such
a
fabric
of
illusion
in
your
mind
it
irritates
me
that
it
should
be
there
about
anybody
belonging
to
me
my
wife
is
not
in
the
least
what
you
imagine
her
she
has
her
virtues
but
she
is
like
the
rest
i
can
not
hope
that
you
will
take
to
her
and
she
won
t
like
you
either
we
never
care
about
the
same
people
and
we
shall
see
nothing
of
you
nothing
i
can
hardly
believe
that
i
am
saying
this
of
my
own
wife
but
i
wish
that
she
had
stayed
in
mrs
mickie
cried
madeline
to
a
passing
rickshaw
what
are
you
rushing
on
like
that
for
just
go
quietly
and
peaceably
along
with
us
please
and
tell
us
what
vesey
decided
to
do
about
her
part
in
the
outcast
pearl
i
m
dining
out
tonight
i
must
and
mickie
was
kind
enough
to
accompany
them
all
the
rest
of
the
way
miss
anderson
dined
out
and
preferred
to
suppose
that
she
had
no
time
to
think
until
she
was
on
her
way
home
along
the
empty
road
round
jakko
at
eleven
o
clock
that
night
then
it
pleased
her
to
get
out
of
her
rickshaw
and
walk
there
was
an
opulent
moon
the
vast
hills
curving
down
to
the
plains
were
all
grey
and
silvery
and
the
deodars
overhead
fretted
the
road
with
dramatic
shadows
about
her
hung
the
great
stillness
in
a
mighty
loneliness
in
which
little
simla
is
set
and
it
freed
her
from
what
had
happened
so
that
she
could
look
at
it
and
cry
out
she
actually
did
speak
pausing
in
the
little
pavilion
on
the
road
where
the
nursemaids
gather
in
the
daytime
but
very
low
so
that
her
words
fell
round
her
even
in
that
silence
and
hardly
a
deodar
was
aware
i
will
not
go
now
she
said
i
will
stay
and
realize
that
he
is
another
woman
s
husband
that
should
cure
me
if
anything
will
to
see
him
surrounded
by
the
commonplaces
of
married
life
that
kind
of
married
life
i
will
stay
till
she
comes
and
a
fortnight
after
besides
i
want
to
see
her
i
want
to
see
how
far
she
comes
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
the
moonlight
played
upon
her
smile
of
quiet
triumph
he
cares
too
she
said
he
cares
too
but
he
doesn
t
know
it
and
i
promise
you
one
thing
madeline
anderson
you
won
t
help
him
to
find
out
and
in
five
weeks
i
will
go
away
and
leave
my
love
where
i
found
it
on
a
mountaintop
in
the
middle
of
asia
chapter
madeline
did
her
best
to
make
certain
changes
delicately
imperceptibly
so
that
innes
would
not
above
all
things
be
perplexed
into
seeking
for
their
reason
the
walks
and
rides
came
to
a
vague
conclusion
and
miss
anderson
no
longer
kept
the
viceroy
or
anybody
else
waiting
while
innes
finished
what
he
had
to
say
to
her
in
public
since
his
opportunities
for
talking
to
her
seemed
to
become
gradually
more
and
more
like
everybody
else
s
so
long
as
she
had
been
mistress
of
herself
she
was
indifferent
to
the
very
tolerant
and
gossip
of
the
hill
capital
but
as
soon
as
she
found
her
citadel
undermined
the
lightest
kind
of
comment
became
a
contingency
unbearable
in
arranging
to
make
it
impossible
she
was
really
and
her
soldier
never
thought
of
analyzing
his
bad
luck
or
searching
for
motive
in
it
to
him
the
combinations
of
circumstances
that
seemed
always
to
deprive
him
of
former
pleasures
were
simply
among
the
things
that
might
happen
grieving
she
left
him
under
that
impression
for
the
sake
of
its
expediency
and
tried
to
make
it
by
being
more
than
ever
agreeable
on
the
occasions
when
he
came
and
demanded
a
cup
of
tea
and
would
not
be
denied
after
all
she
consoled
herself
no
situation
was
improved
by
being
turned
too
suddenly
upside
down
she
did
not
wholly
withdraw
his
privilege
of
taking
counsel
with
her
and
he
continued
to
go
away
freshened
and
calmed
leaving
her
to
toss
little
sad
reflections
into
the
fire
and
tremulously
wonder
whether
the
jewel
of
her
love
had
flashed
ever
so
little
behind
the
eyes
they
both
saw
it
a
conspicuous
thing
that
as
those
three
weeks
went
on
neither
he
nor
she
alluded
even
remotely
to
innes
but
the
fact
remained
and
they
allowed
it
to
remain
nevertheless
madeline
knew
precisely
when
that
lady
was
expected
and
as
she
sauntered
in
the
bazaar
one
morning
and
heard
innes
s
steps
and
voice
behind
her
her
mind
became
one
acute
surmise
as
to
whether
he
could
possibly
postpone
the
announcement
any
longer
but
he
immediately
made
it
plain
that
this
was
his
business
in
stopping
to
speak
to
her
good
morning
he
said
and
then
my
wife
comes
he
had
not
told
her
a
bit
of
personal
news
he
had
made
her
an
official
communication
as
briefly
as
it
could
be
done
and
he
would
have
raised
his
hat
and
gone
on
without
more
words
if
madeline
had
not
thwarted
him
what
a
stupidity
for
him
to
be
haunted
by
afterward
was
the
essence
of
the
thought
that
visited
her
and
she
put
out
a
detaining
hand
really
by
the
bombay
mail
i
suppose
no
an
hour
or
so
later
private
tongas
are
always
as
much
as
that
behind
the
about
eleven
i
fancy
you
you
are
not
inclined
for
a
canter
round
summer
hill
before
breakfast
i
am
terrified
of
summer
hill
the
turk
always
misbehaves
there
yesterday
he
got
one
leg
well
over
the
khud
i
was
thankful
he
had
four
tell
me
are
you
ready
for
innes
everything
in
the
house
is
there
anything
i
can
do
oh
thanks
very
much
i
don
t
think
so
the
house
isn
t
ready
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
two
or
three
people
have
offered
to
put
us
up
for
a
day
or
so
until
it
is
i
ve
left
it
open
till
my
wife
comes
as
i
dare
say
she
has
already
arranged
to
go
to
somebody
what
are
you
buying
country
tobacco
upon
my
word
for
your
men
that
s
subversive
of
all
discipline
the
lines
on
his
face
relaxed
he
looked
at
her
with
fond
recognition
of
another
delightful
thing
in
her
you
give
to
your
horses
she
declared
why
shouldn
t
i
give
tobacco
to
mine
goodbye
i
hope
innes
will
like
two
gables
there
are
roses
waiting
for
her
in
the
garden
at
all
are
there
he
said
i
didn
t
notice
goodbye
he
went
on
to
his
office
thinking
of
the
roses
and
that
they
were
in
his
garden
and
that
madeline
had
seen
them
there
he
thought
that
if
they
were
good
roses
in
fact
any
kind
of
roses
they
should
be
taken
care
of
and
he
asked
a
deputy
assistant
of
ordnance
whether
he
knew
of
a
gardener
that
was
worth
anything
most
of
them
are
mere
coolies
said
colonel
innes
and
i
ve
got
some
roses
in
this
little
place
i
ve
taken
that
i
want
to
look
next
day
madeline
took
brookes
and
the
amazing
marriage
and
a
and
went
out
to
mashobra
where
the
deodars
shadow
hardly
any
scandal
at
all
and
the
snows
come
with
perceptible
confidence
a
little
nearer
they
almost
step
she
said
to
brookes
looking
at
them
out
of
the
realm
of
the
brookes
said
that
they
did
indeed
and
hoped
that
she
hadn
t
by
any
chance
forgotten
the
mustard
the
wind
is
keen
off
the
glaciers
over
there
anybody
would
think
of
a
condiment
miss
anderson
remarked
in
deprecation
and
to
this
brookes
made
no
response
it
was
a
liberty
she
often
felt
compelled
to
take
the
snows
appealed
to
madeline
even
more
than
did
carintha
countess
of
fleetwood
to
whose
fortunes
she
gave
long
pauses
while
she
looked
across
their
summits
at
renunciation
and
fancied
her
spirit
made
strong
and
equal
to
its
task
she
was
glad
of
their
sanctuary
she
did
not
know
where
she
should
find
such
another
perhaps
the
spectacle
was
more
than
ever
sublime
in
its
alternative
to
the
one
she
had
come
away
to
postpone
the
sight
of
at
all
events
it
drove
the
reunion
of
the
inneses
from
her
mind
several
times
for
five
minutes
together
during
which
she
thought
of
horace
by
himself
and
went
over
by
way
of
preparation
for
her
departure
all
that
had
come
and
gone
between
them
there
had
been
luminous
moments
especially
as
they
irradiated
him
and
she
dwelt
on
these
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
preserve
in
london
or
in
new
york
a
careful
memory
of
them
so
the
lights
were
twinkling
all
up
and
down
and
round
about
simla
when
she
cantered
back
to
it
and
it
was
late
when
she
started
for
the
worsleys
where
she
was
dining
one
little
lighted
house
looked
much
like
another
perched
on
the
mountainside
and
the
wooden
board
painted
branksome
hall
worsley
nailed
to
the
most
conspicuous
tree
from
the
main
road
was
invisible
in
the
darkness
madeline
arrived
in
consequence
at
the
wrong
and
was
acclaimed
and
redirected
with
much
gaiety
which
gave
her
a
further
agreeable
impression
of
the
insouciance
of
simla
but
made
her
later
still
at
the
worsleys
so
that
half
the
people
were
already
seated
when
she
at
last
appeared
and
her
hostess
had
just
time
to
cry
my
dear
we
thought
the
langurs
must
have
eaten
you
captain
gordon
you
are
not
abandoned
after
all
you
know
miss
anderson
when
she
found
herself
before
her
soup
captain
gordon
heard
her
account
of
herself
with
complacence
and
declared
wiping
his
moustache
that
a
similar
experience
had
befallen
him
only
a
fortnight
before
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
that
chap
sir
james
jackson
who
went
to
the
right
by
mistake
he
asked
and
apologized
like
mad
by
jove
and
insisted
he
couldn
t
stay
the
people
nearly
had
to
tie
him
down
in
his
captain
gordon
stopped
arrested
by
his
companion
s
sudden
and
complete
inattention
i
see
a
lady
interrupted
madeline
with
odd
distinctness
curiously
like
somebody
i
have
known
her
eyes
convinced
themselves
and
then
refused
to
be
convinced
of
the
inconceivable
fact
that
they
were
resting
on
violet
prendergast
it
was
at
first
too
amazing
too
amazing
only
then
an
old
forgotten
feeling
rose
in
her
bosom
the
hand
on
the
stem
of
her
grew
tense
the
sensation
fell
away
she
remembered
her
emancipation
the
years
arose
and
reassured
her
during
which
violet
prendergast
living
or
dead
had
been
to
her
of
absolutely
no
importance
yet
there
was
a
little
aroused
tremour
in
her
voice
as
she
went
on
she
is
on
the
general
s
right
he
must
have
taken
her
in
can
you
see
from
where
you
are
sitting
these
narrow
oval
tables
are
a
nuisance
that
way
aren
t
they
you
don
t
know
who
you
re
dining
with
till
the
end
of
the
function
oh
i
see
that
s
innes
just
out
and
fresh
as
paint
isn
t
she
the
colonel
captain
gordon
craned
his
head
again
is
sitting
fourth
from
me
on
this
mrs
innes
really
said
madeline
then
then
of
course
i
must
be
she
removed
her
eyes
almost
stealthily
from
the
other
woman
s
face
and
fixed
them
on
the
pattern
of
the
her
brain
guided
her
clearly
through
the
tumult
of
her
perception
and
no
emotion
could
be
observed
in
the
smiling
attention
which
she
gave
to
captain
gordon
s
account
of
the
afternoon
s
tandem
racing
but
there
was
a
furious
beating
in
her
breast
and
she
thought
she
could
never
draw
a
breath
long
enough
to
control
it
it
helped
her
that
there
was
food
to
swallow
wine
to
drink
and
captain
gordon
to
listen
to
and
under
cover
of
these
things
she
gradually
consciously
prepared
herself
for
the
shock
of
encounter
which
should
be
conclusive
presently
she
leaned
a
little
forward
and
let
her
glance
in
which
no
outsider
could
see
the
steady
recognition
rest
upon
the
lady
on
the
general
s
right
until
that
person
s
agreeable
blue
eyes
wandered
down
the
table
and
met
it
perhaps
madeline
s
own
eyelids
fluttered
a
little
as
she
saw
the
sudden
stricture
in
the
face
that
received
her
message
and
the
grimace
with
which
it
uttered
pallid
with
apprehension
its
response
to
a
pleasantry
of
general
worsley
s
she
was
not
consummate
in
her
but
she
was
able
at
all
events
to
send
the
glance
travelling
prettily
on
with
a
casual
smile
for
an
intervening
friend
and
bring
it
back
to
her
without
mischief
it
did
not
adventure
again
she
knew
and
she
set
herself
to
hold
her
knowledge
to
look
at
it
and
understand
it
while
the
mechanical
part
of
her
made
up
its
mind
about
the
entrees
and
sympathized
with
captain
gordon
on
his
hard
luck
in
having
three
ponies
laid
up
at
once
she
did
not
look
again
although
she
felt
the
watching
of
the
other
woman
and
was
quite
aware
of
the
moment
at
which
innes
allowed
herself
the
reprieve
of
believing
that
at
the
worsley
s
at
least
there
would
be
no
scandal
the
belief
had
its
reflex
action
doing
something
to
calm
her
how
could
there
be
scandal
she
asked
herself
and
dismissed
with
relief
the
denunciations
which
crowded
vague
but
insistent
in
her
brain
even
then
she
had
not
grasped
the
salient
points
of
the
situation
she
was
too
much
occupied
with
its
irony
as
it
affected
her
personally
her
impressions
circled
steadily
round
the
word
twice
and
the
unimaginable
coincidence
her
resentment
filled
her
and
her
indignation
was
like
a
clear
flame
behind
her
smiling
face
robbed
twice
once
in
new
york
and
oh
preposterous
the
second
time
in
simla
robbed
of
the
same
things
by
the
same
hand
she
perceived
in
the
shock
of
it
only
a
monstrous
fatality
a
ludicrously
wicked
chance
this
may
have
been
due
to
the
necessity
of
listening
to
captain
gordon
at
all
events
it
was
only
as
she
passed
colonel
innes
on
her
way
to
the
and
saw
ahead
of
her
the
very
modish
receding
back
of
innes
that
she
realized
other
things
crime
and
freedom
it
was
the
reversion
of
power
it
brought
her
a
great
exultation
she
sat
down
under
it
in
a
corner
hoping
to
be
left
alone
with
a
white
face
and
shining
eyes
power
and
opportunity
and
purpose
righteous
purpose
the
circumstances
had
come
to
her
in
a
flash
she
brought
them
up
again
steadily
and
scrutinized
them
the
case
was
absolutely
clear
frank
prendergast
had
been
dead
just
seven
months
colonel
innes
imagined
himself
married
four
years
violet
prendergast
was
a
bigamist
and
horace
innes
had
no
wife
that
was
the
marvellous
transcendent
fact
that
was
what
lifted
her
and
carried
her
on
great
pulsing
waves
that
rolled
beyond
the
walls
of
the
little
fripperied
and
its
collection
of
women
out
into
her
life
which
had
not
these
boundaries
she
lived
again
in
a
possible
world
there
was
no
stone
wall
between
herself
and
joy
the
old
mussulman
butler
who
offered
her
coffee
looked
at
her
with
aroused
curiosity
here
was
certainly
a
memsahib
under
the
favour
of
god
and
as
she
stirred
it
the
shadow
that
violet
prendergast
had
thrown
upon
her
life
faded
out
of
her
mind
in
the
light
that
was
there
then
she
looked
up
and
met
that
lady
s
vivid
blue
eyes
innes
s
colour
had
not
returned
but
there
was
a
recklessness
in
the
lines
of
her
mouth
in
the
way
she
held
her
chin
expressing
that
she
had
been
reflecting
on
old
scores
and
anticipated
the
worst
meeting
this
vigilance
miss
anderson
experienced
a
slight
recoil
her
happiness
she
realized
had
been
brought
to
her
in
the
hands
of
ugly
circumstance
and
so
melodramatic
she
told
herself
it
is
really
almost
vulgar
in
a
story
i
should
have
no
patience
with
but
she
went
on
stirring
her
coffee
with
a
little
uncontrollable
smile
a
moment
later
she
had
to
contemplate
the
circumstance
that
her
hostess
was
addressing
her
innes
wished
to
be
introduced
innes
incarnate
conscious
sensation
was
smiling
at
her
saying
that
she
must
know
so
great
a
friend
of
her
husband
s
he
made
so
few
friends
and
she
was
so
grateful
to
anybody
who
was
good
to
him
eyes
and
voice
tolerably
in
rein
aware
of
the
situation
at
every
point
she
had
a
meretricious
daring
and
it
occurred
to
madeline
looking
at
her
that
she
was
after
all
a
fairly
competent
adventuress
she
would
not
refuse
the
cue
it
would
make
so
little
difference
on
the
contrary
i
am
tremendously
indebted
to
colonel
innes
he
has
been
so
very
kind
about
ponies
and
jhampanies
and
things
simla
is
full
of
pitfalls
for
a
stranger
don
t
you
think
and
miss
anderson
unclosing
her
fan
turned
her
reposeful
head
a
little
in
the
direction
of
three
married
schoolgirls
voluble
on
her
left
not
when
you
get
to
know
the
language
you
must
learn
the
language
it
s
indispensable
but
of
course
it
depends
on
how
long
you
mean
to
i
think
i
will
learn
the
language
said
madeline
but
general
worsley
told
me
you
were
leaving
simla
in
a
oh
no
my
plans
are
very
indefinite
but
i
shall
stay
much
longer
than
it
is
miss
anderson
isn
t
it
miss
madeline
anderson
of
new
york
no
brooklyn
madeline
looked
at
her
did
not
the
general
say
so
she
asked
yes
he
did
but
one
looks
to
make
quite
i
can
understand
innes
leaned
forward
with
one
elbow
on
her
knee
it
was
not
a
graceful
attitude
but
it
gave
the
casual
air
to
the
conversation
which
was
desirable
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
said
my
plans
are
as
indefinite
as
possible
really
madeline
returned
i
may
spend
the
cold
weather
in
calcutta
or
go
into
camp
with
the
dovedells
i
should
like
mrs
innes
cried
the
nearest
schoolgirl
we
are
coming
tomorrow
to
see
all
the
lovely
things
in
your
boxes
may
we
do
duckies
but
mind
no
copying

them
by
durzies
in
the
veranda
they
re
all
paris
things
coulter
s
and
you
know
he
doesn
t
copy
well
does
he
oh
dear
here

the
men
they
always
come
too
soon

t
they
so
glad
to

even
a
little
chat

anderson

and

india

the
first
calls
i
shall
find
you
at
home
sha
n
t
i
by
all
means
madeline
said
innes
crossed
the
room
crying
out
that
the
heat
was
perfectly
absurd
for
simla
it
must
be
cooler
outside
and
as
captain
valentine
drake
followed
her
into
the
of
the
veranda
the
three
married
schoolgirls
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
don
t
be
naughty
said
captain
gordon
leaning
over
the
sofa
from
behind
they
re
very
dear
friends
and
they
ve
been
separated
for
two
madeline
heard
this
as
plainly
as
they
did
she
noted
disdainfully
how
it
all
fell
in
how
absent
you
are
tonight
horace
innes
exclaimed
when
miss
anderson
had
asked
him
a
trivial
question
for
the
third
time
hush
she
said
mrs
scallepa
is
going
to
sing
and
as
scallepa
sang
she
let
her
eyes
play
over
him
with
a
light
in
them
so
tender
that
once
catching
it
the
felt
a
sudden
answering
throb
and
looked
again
but
after
that
her
eyes
were
on
the
floor
we
are
staying
here
he
said
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
as
he
saw
her
into
her
rickshaw
and
i
think
i
must
see
you
to
your
quarters
it
s
very
dark
and
there
is
an
ugly
little
slip
between
this
and
the
mall
he
ran
upstairs
to
get
his
coat
and
stick
and
a
white
face
like
an
apparition
suddenly
hung
itself
on
the
edge
of
madeline
s
don
t
tell
him
tonight
it
said
hoarsely
are
you
ready
colonel
innes
then
good
night
everybody
cried
madeline
she
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
would
not
tell
horace
innes
tonight
chapter
my
wife
said
colonel
innes
is
looking
extremely
she
seems
so
indeed
madeline
replied
she
is
delighted
with
two
gables
likes
it
better
she
says
than
any
other
house
we
could
have
what
a
good
thing
it
was
a
record
trip
for
the
caledonia
thirteen
days
from
brindisi
to
bombay
was
she
telling
you
about
the
voyage
no
said
madeline
impatiently
she
didn
t
mention
it
how
shall
i
tell
the
men
to
put
down
the
hood
please
a
rickshaw
is
detestable
with
the
hood
up
stifling
thanks
i
beg
your
pardon
the
caledonia
made
a
good
run
thirteen
days
wonderful
weather
of
course
which
was
luck
for
violet
she
is
an
atrocious
madeline
fancied
she
heard
repose
and
reassurance
in
his
voice
her
thought
cried
it
is
not
so
bad
as
he
expected
we
can
not
be
surprised
that
she
failed
to
see
in
herself
the
alleviation
of
that
first
evening
she
has
brought
quantities
of
things
for
the
house
with
her
innes
went
on
as
well
as
three
dachshund
puppies
and
he
laughed
wouldn
t
you
like
one
what
can
we
do
with
three
and
the
terrier
and
brutus
oh
thank
you
how
could
he
laugh
how
could
he
speak
pleasantly
of
these
intimate
details
of
his
bondage
how
could
he
conceive
that
she
would
accept
already
she
has
arranged
four
it
will
be
a
relief
not
to
have
to
think
of
that
sort
of
thing
to
be
able
to
leave
it
to
mrs
innes
must
have
great
energy
to
drive
all
the
way
up
from
kalka
by
noon
and
appear
at
a
at
night
wonderful
oh
great
energy
horace
said
she
will
take
you
everywhere
to
all
the
functions
she
will
insist
on
your
duty
to
madeline
felt
that
she
must
get
him
somehow
back
into
his
slough
of
despond
his
freedom
paralyzed
her
and
he
returned
with
a
pathetic
change
of
tone
i
suppose
there
is
no
alternative
violet
is
very
good
about
being
willing
to
go
alone
or
with
somebody
else
but
i
never
think
it
quite
fair
on
one
s
wife
to
impose
on
her
the
necessity
of
going
about
with
other
mrs
worsley
introduced
us
after
dinner
said
madeline
she
kept
disparagement
out
of
her
mind
but
he
could
not
help
perceiving
aloofness
yes
the
monosyllable
told
her
sensitive
ear
that
while
he
admitted
her
consideration
in
going
on
with
the
subject
he
was
willing
to
recognize
that
there
was
no
more
to
say
and
have
done
with
it
she
gathered
up
her
scruples
and
repugnances
in
a
firm
grasp
she
would
not
let
him
throw
his
own
shadow
as
an
effectual
obstacle
between
himself
and
liberty
i
am
going
to
ask
you
something
she
said
it
might
come
naturally
enough
from
another
man
with
whom
your
friendship
was
as
candid
as
it
is
with
me
but
there
is
an
awkwardness
in
it
from
a
woman
you
must
believe
i
have
a
good
reason
will
you
tell
me
about
your
first
meeting
with
innes
when
when
you
became
engaged
she
knew
she
was
daring
a
good
deal
but
when
a
man
s
prison
is
to
be
brought
down
about
his
ears
one
might
as
well
begin
she
thought
at
the
foundation
for
a
moment
innes
did
not
speak
and
then
his
words
came
slowly
i
find
it
difficult
he
said
to
answer
you
how
can
it
matter
it
is
impossible
i
suppose
you
have
heard
some
story
and
it
is
like
you
to
want
to
be
in
a
position
to
negative
it
ignore
it
instead
she
has
very
successfully
championed
herself
believe
nothing
to
her
disadvantage
that
may
be
said
about
that
that
time
i
was
pleased
to
marry
her
and
she
was
pleased
to
marry
me
but
for
god
s
sake
don
t
let
us
talk
about
it
as
he
spoke
madeline
saw
the
vivid
clearness
of
the
situation
grow
blurred
and
confused
it
was
as
if
her
point
of
view
had
suddenly
changed
and
her
eyes
failed
her
her
eager
impulse
had
beat
less
and
less
strongly
from
the
worsley
s
door
now
it
seemed
to
shrink
away
in
fetters
her
eyes
filled
with
vaguely
resentful
tears
which
sprang
if
she
could
have
traced
them
from
the
fact
that
the
man
she
loved
was
loyal
to
his
own
mistake
and
the
formless
premonition
that
he
might
continue
to
be
she
contorted
her
lip
to
keep
her
emotion
back
and
deliberately
turned
away
from
a
matter
in
which
she
was
not
mistress
and
which
contained
ugly
possibilities
of
buffeting
she
would
wait
a
little
and
though
consideration
for
violet
prendergast
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
would
not
tell
him
tonight
i
am
sorry
she
said
and
after
a
moment
did
i
tell
you
that
i
have
changed
my
plans
you
are
not
going
so
soon
she
took
all
the
comfort
there
was
in
his
eagerness
i
am
not
going
at
all
for
the
present
i
have
abandoned
my
intentions
and
my
dates
i
mean
to
drift
for
a
little
while
i
have
been
too
too
are
you
quite
serious
do
you
mean
it
indeed
i
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
you
will
not
go
out
of
one
s
life
you
will
stay
on
you
summer
day
it
s
hard
to
believe
in
luck
like
that
i
sent
a
poor
devil
of
a
sepoy
a
reprieve
last
week
one
knows
now
how
he
must
have
felt
about
does
it
make
all
that
difference
madeline
asked
softly
it
makes
a
difference
he
answered
controlling
his
words
that
i
am
glad
you
can
not
conceive
since
that
would
mean
that
your
life
has
been
as
barren
as
he
seemed
to
refrain
from
saying
more
and
then
he
added
you
must
be
careful
when
you
plant
your
friendship
that
you
mean
it
to
stay
and
blossom
it
will
not
come
easily
up
by
the
roots
and
it
will
leave
an
ugly
he
was
helping
her
out
of
her
rickshaw
and
as
they
followed
the
servant
who
carried
her
wraps
the
few
yards
to
the
door
she
left
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
it
was
the
seal
he
thought
of
her
unwritten
bond
that
there
should
be
no
uprooting
of
the
single
flower
he
cherished
and
he
went
back
almost
buoyantly
because
of
it
to
the
woman
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
sackcloth
and
ashes
of
misfortune
turning
over
the
expedients
for
which
his
step
might
make
occasion
by
the
time
the
monkeys
began
to
scramble
about
the
roof
in
the
early
creeping
of
the
dawn
among
the
deodars
madeline
had
groped
her
way
to
a
tolerably
clear
conception
of
what
might
happen
the
impeding
circumstance
everywhere
it
must
be
acknowledged
was
frederick
prendergast
s
coffin
the
case
had
convict
no
been
still
alive
and
working
out
his
debt
to
society
would
have
been
transcendentally
simple
she
told
herself
even
a
convict
has
a
right
a
prospective
right
to
his
wife
and
no
honest
man
should
be
compelled
to
retain
a
criminal
s
property
this
was
an
odd
reflection
perhaps
to
be
made
by
madeline
anderson
but
the
situation
as
a
whole
might
be
described
as
curious
and
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
coffin
chapter
the
veranda
of
which
miss
anderson
s
little
claimed
its
section
hung
over
the
road
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
heard
the
sound
of
innes
s
arrival
about
ten
minutes
after
breakfast
on
the
contrary
she
had
spent
two
whole
hours
contemplating
with
very
fixed
attention
first
the
domestic
circumstances
of
colonel
horace
innes
and
their
possible
development
and
then
with
a
pang
of
profoundest
acknowledgment
the
moral
qualities
which
he
would
bring
to
bear
upon
them
she
was
further
from
knowing
what
course
she
personally
intended
to
pursue
than
ever
when
she
heard
the
wheels
roll
up
underneath
and
she
had
worked
herself
into
a
state
of
sufficient
detachment
from
the
whole
problem
to
reflect
upon
the
absurdity
of
a
bigamist
rattling
forth
to
discuss
her
probable
ruin
in
the
fanciful
gaiety
of
a
rickshaw
the
circumstances
had
its
value
though
it
lightened
all
responsibility
for
the
lady
concerned
as
madeline
heard
her
jump
out
and
give
pronounced
orders
for
the
securing
of
an
accompanying
dachshund
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
so
particularly
what
became
of
violet
prendergast
innes
s
footsteps
came
briskly
along
the
veranda
madeline
noted
that
there
was
no
lagging
number
seven
she
said
aloud
as
she
passed
other
doors
number
eight
number
nine
ah
there
you
the
door
was
open
i
wouldn
t
let
them
bring
up
my
card
for
fear
of
some
mistake
how
do
you
do
now
please
don
t
get
up
you
look
so
comfortable
with
your
book
what
is
it
oh
yes
of
course
that
people
were
talking
about
it
a
good
deal
when
i
left
london
but
i
haven
t
read
it
is
it
good
i
like
it
said
madeline
she
half
rose
as
innes
entered
but
as
the
lady
did
not
seem
to
miss
the
ceremony
of
greeting
she
was
glad
to
sink
back
in
her
chair
and
how
do
you
like
simla
charming
in
many
ways
isn
t
it
a
little
too
flippant
i
always
say
rather
too
much
champagne
and
silliness
but
awfully
the
snows
are
magnificent
madeline
said
when
you
can
see
them
and
there
s
a
lot
of
good
work
done
aren
t
they
divine
i
did
nothing
absolutely
nothing
my
first
season
but
paint
them
and
the
shops
they
re
not
bad
are
they
for
the
size
of
the
place
though
today
upon
my
soul
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
a
yard
of
white
spotted
veiling
among
that
is
annoying
said
madeline
if
you
want
spotted
isn
t
it
well
innes
take
a
deep
breath
you
didn
t
tell
him
last
night
n
no
said
madeline
with
deliberation
i
was
grateful
i
knew
i
could
rely
upon
you
not
to
it
would
have
been
too
cruel
when
we
have
only
just
been
reunited
dear
horace
would
have
had
to
sleep
in
the
pray
well
horace
is
the
soul
of
honour
is
your
ayah
in
there
innes
nodded
towards
the
bedroom
door
you
can
not
imagine
what
long
ears
she
i
have
no
ayah
there
is
only
brookes
and
as
that
excellent
woman
passed
through
the
room
with
a
towel
over
her
arm
madeline
said
you
can
go
now
brookes
and
see
about
that
alpaca
take
the
rickshaw
it
looks
very
maid
you
are
a
swell
there
are
only
four
genuine
maids
in
simla
that
i
know
of
the
rest
are
really
what
a
comfort
she
must
be
the
luxury
of
all
others
that
i
long
for
but
alas
army
pay
you
know
i
did
once
bring
a
dear
thing
out
with
me
from
nice
you
should
have
seen
horace
s
i
couldn
t
very
well
go
about
quite
alone
it
would
be
except
that
you
americans
are
so
perfectly
on
the
contrary
if
i
could
order
about
a
servant
the
way
an
englishwoman
does
say
you
are
not
going
to
tell
him
i
ve
got
such
a
lot
of
other
calls
to
make
exclaimed
innes
dear
lady
bloomfield
won
t
understand
it
if
i
don
t
call
today
especially
after
the
baby
what
people
in
that
position
want
with
more
babies
i
can
not
comprehend
of
course
you
haven
t
noticed
it
but
a
baby
is
such
a
shock
to
don
t
let
me
keep
you
madeline
said
rising
but
you
haven
t
promised
do
promise
miss
anderson
you
gain
nothing
by
telling
him
except
your
revenge
and
i
should
think
by
this
time
you
would
have
forgiven
me
for
taking
frederick
away
from
you
he
didn
t
turn
out
so
well
you
can
t
still
bear
me
malice
over
that
convict
in
sing
for
his
sake
poor
fellow
i
coming
along
i
said
to
myself
she
can
score
off
me
badly
but
surely
she
doesn
t
want
to
so
much
as
all
besides
i
really
only
took
your
leavings
you
know
you
threw
poor
fred
prendergast
i
am
not
prepared
to
discuss
that
madeline
said
at
no
pains
to
smooth
the
curve
out
of
her
lip
then
i
thought
perhaps
you
never
can
tell
with
people
she
will
think
it
her
duty
to
make
a
that
is
a
possible
point
of
i
know
you
think
i
m
an
imposter
on
society
and
i
ought
to
be
exposed
and
i
suppose
you
could
shut
every
door
in
simla
against
me
if
you
liked
but
you
are
a
friend
of
my
husband
s
miss
anderson
you
would
not
turn
his
whole
married
life
into
a
scandal
and
ruin
his
career
ruin
his
career
of
course
government
is
awfully
particular
it
mayn
t
be
his
fault
in
the
least
but
no
man
is
likely
to
get
any
big
position
with
a
cloud
over
his
domestic
affairs
horace
would
resign
or
take
long
leave
innes
added
to
herself
but
she
did
not
give
madeline
this
alternative
a
line
or
two
of
nervous
irritation
marked
themselves
about
her
eyes
and
her
colour
had
faded
her
hat
was
less
becoming
than
it
had
been
and
she
had
pulled
a
button
off
her
glove
besides
she
went
on
quickly
it
isn
t
as
if
you
could
do
any
good
you
know
the
harm
was
done
once
for
all
when
i
let
him
think
he
d
married
me
i
thought
then
well
i
had
to
take
it
or
leave
it
and
every
week
i
expected
to
hear
of
frederick
s
death
then
i
meant
to
tell
horace
myself
and
have
the
ceremony
over
again
he
couldn
t
refuse
and
all
these
years
it
s
been
like
living
on
a
volcano
in
the
fear
of
meeting
new
york
people
out
here
there
never
are
any
but
in
england
i
dye
my
hair
and
alter
my
why
did
you
change
your
mind
madeline
asked
about
telling
colonel
innes
i
haven
t
why
should
i
change
my
mind
for
my
own
protection
i
mean
to
get
things
put
straight
instantly
when
the
time
when
the
time
comes
madeline
repeated
and
her
eyes
as
she
fixed
them
on
innes
were
suddenly
so
lightened
with
a
new
idea
that
she
dropped
the
lids
over
them
as
she
waited
for
the
answer
when
poor
frederick
does
pass
away
innes
said
with
an
air
of
observing
the
proprieties
when
they
put
him
in
prison
it
was
a
matter
of
months
the
doctors
said
that
was
one
reason
why
i
went
abroad
i
couldn
t
bear
to
stay
there
and
see
him
dying
by
inches
poor
couldn
t
you
oh
i
couldn
t
and
the
idea
of
the
hard
labour
made
me
sick
but
it
seems
to
have
improved
his
health
and
now
there
is
no
telling
i
sometimes
believe
he
will
live
out
his
sentence
should
you
think
that
possible
in
the
case
of
a
man
with
half
a
lung
i
have
no
knowledge
of
pulmonary
disease
madeline
said
she
forced
the
words
from
her
lips
and
carefully
looked
away
taking
this
second
key
to
the
situation
mechanically
and
for
a
moment
groping
with
it
what
arrangement
did
you
make
to
be
informed
about
about
him
she
asked
and
instantly
regretted
having
gone
so
perilously
near
provoking
a
direct
question
i
subscribe
to
the
new
york
world
i
used
to
see
lots
of
things
in
it
about
the
shock
the
news
of
my
death
gave
him
a
flash
of
hysterical
amusement
shot
into
innes
s
eyes
and
she
questioned
madeline
s
face
to
see
whether
it
responded
to
her
humour
then
she
put
her
own
features
straight
behind
her
handkerchief
and
went
on
and
about
his
failing
health
and
then
about
his
being
so
much
better
but
nothing
now
for
did
the
world
tell
you
asked
miss
anderson
with
sudden
interest
that
prendergast
came
into
a
considerable
fortune
before
about
two
years
ago
innes
s
face
turned
suddenly
blank
how
much
she
exclaimed
about
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
believe
left
him
by
a
cousin
then
you
didn
t
know
that
must
have
been
gordon
prendergast
the
engineer
innes
said
with
excitement
fancy
that
leaving
money
to
a
relation
in
sing
sing
hadn
t
altered
his
will
i
suppose
who
could
possibly
and
her
face
fell
visibly
have
foreseen
such
a
thing
no
one
i
think
said
madeline
through
a
little
edged
smile
on
that
point
you
will
hardly
be
innes
with
clasped
hands
was
sunk
in
thought
she
raised
her
eyes
with
a
conviction
in
them
which
she
evidently
felt
to
be
pathetic
after
all
she
said
there
is
something
in
what
the
padres
say
about
our
reaping
the
reward
of
our
misdeeds
in
this
world
some
of
us
anyway
if
i
had
stayed
in
new
york
yes
said
madeline
i
shall
wake
up
presently
she
reflected
and
find
that
i
have
been
dreaming
but
that
was
a
fantastic
underscoring
of
her
experience
she
knew
very
well
she
was
making
it
innes
again
wrapped
in
astonished
contemplation
did
not
reply
then
she
jumped
to
her
feet
with
a
gesture
that
cast
fortunes
back
into
the
lap
of
fate
one
thing
is
certain
she
said
i
can
t
do
anything
now
can
i
madeline
laid
hold
of
silence
and
made
armour
with
it
at
all
events
she
must
have
time
to
think
i
decline
to
advise
you
she
said
and
she
spoke
with
a
barely
perceptive
movement
of
her
lips
only
the
rest
of
her
face
was
stone
how
unkind
and
unforgiving
you
are
must
people
would
think
the
loss
of
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
about
punishment
enough
for
what
i
have
done
you
don
t
seem
to
see
it
but
on
top
of
that
you
won
t
refuse
to
promise
not
to
tell
horace
i
will
not
bind
myself
in
any
way
not
even
when
you
know
that
the
moment
i
hear
of
the
death
i
intend
to
to
make
an
honest
man
of
him
not
even
when
i
know
do
you
want
me
to
go
down
on
my
knees
to
you
madeline
glanced
at
the
flowered
fabric
involved
and
said
i
wouldn
t
i
and
this
is
to
hang
over
me
the
whole
season
i
shall
enjoy
nothing
absolutely
the
blue
eyes
were
suddenly
eclipsed
by
angry
tears
which
the
advent
of
a
servant
with
cards
checked
as
suddenly
goodbye
then
dear
cried
innes
as
if
in
response
to
the
advancing
rustle
of
skirts
in
the
veranda
so
glad
to
have
found
you
at
home
dear
me
has
trilby
made
her
way
up
and
i
gave
such
particular
orders
oh
you
naughty
dog
chapter
from
the
complication
that
surged
round
miss
anderson
s
waking
hours
one
point
emerged
and
gave
her
a
perch
for
congratulation
that
was
the
determination
she
had
shown
in
refusing
to
let
frederick
prendergast
leave
her
his
money
or
any
part
of
it
it
has
been
said
that
he
had
outlived
her
tenderness
if
not
her
care
and
this
fact
which
she
never
found
it
necessary
to
communicate
to
poor
frederick
himself
naturally
made
his
desire
in
the
matter
sharply
distasteful
she
was
even
unaware
of
the
disposition
he
had
made
of
his
ironical
fortune
a
reflection
which
brought
her
thankfulness
that
there
was
something
she
did
not
know
if
i
had
let
him
do
it
she
thought
i
should
have
felt
compelled
to
tell
her
everything
instantly
and
think
of
discussing
it
with
her
this
was
quite
a
fortnight
later
and
innes
still
occupied
her
remarkable
position
only
in
her
own
mind
and
madeline
s
still
knowing
herself
the
wife
of
and
of
only
and
still
unaware
that
was
in
his
grave
simla
had
gone
on
with
its
dances
and
dinners
and
gymkhanas
quite
as
if
no
crucial
experience
were
hanging
over
the
heads
of
three
of
the
people
one
met
everywhere
and
the
three
people
continued
to
be
met
everywhere
although
only
one
of
them
was
unconscious
the
women
tried
to
avoid
each
other
without
accenting
it
exchanging
light
words
only
as
occasion
demanded
but
they
were
not
clever
enough
for
gammidge
and
mickie
who
went
about
saying
that
innes
s
treatment
of
madeline
anderson
was
as
ridiculous
as
it
was
inexplicable
did
you
ever
know
her
to
be
jealous
of
anybody
before
demanded
mickie
to
which
gammidge
responded
with
her
customary
humour
that
the
colonel
had
never
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
been
known
to
give
her
occasion
well
declared
mickie
if
friendships
unsentimental
friendships
between
men
and
women
are
not
understood
in
simla
i
d
like
to
be
told
what
is
between
them
they
gave
madeline
a
noble
support
for
which
although
she
did
not
particularly
require
it
and
they
did
not
venture
to
offer
it
in
so
many
words
she
was
grateful
a
breath
of
public
criticism
from
any
point
of
view
would
have
blown
over
the
toppling
structure
she
was
defending
against
her
conscience
the
siege
was
severe
and
obstinate
with
an
undermining
conviction
ever
at
work
that
in
the
end
she
would
yield
in
the
end
she
would
go
away
at
least
as
far
as
bombay
or
calcutta
and
from
there
send
to
innes
the
news
of
her
liberation
it
would
not
be
necessary
after
all
or
even
excusable
to
tell
horace
his
wife
would
do
that
quickly
enough
at
least
she
had
said
she
would
if
she
didn
t
well
if
she
didn
t
nothing
would
be
possible
but
another
letter
giving
him
the
simple
facts
she
madeline
carefully
out
of
the
way
of
his
path
of
duty
at
all
events
at
calcutta
or
bombay
but
there
was
no
danger
that
innes
would
lose
the
advantage
of
confession
of
throwing
herself
on
his
generosity
and
at
this
point
madeline
usually
felt
her
defenses
against
her
better
nature
considerably
strengthened
and
the
date
of
her
sacrifice
grow
vague
again
meanwhile
she
was
astonished
to
observe
that
in
spite
of
her
threat
to
the
contrary
innes
appeared
to
be
enjoying
herself
particularly
well
madeline
had
frequent
occasion
for
private
comment
on
the
advantages
of
a
temperament
that
could
find
satisfaction
in
dancing
through
whole
programmes
at
the
very
door
so
to
speak
of
the
criminal
courts
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
capacity
of
innes
s
went
far
to
increase
the
vacillation
with
which
miss
anderson
considered
her
duty
towards
that
lady
if
she
had
shown
traces
of
a
single
hour
of
genuine
suffering
there
would
have
been
an
end
to
madeline
s
hesitation
but
beyond
an
occasional
watchful
glance
at
conversations
in
which
she
might
be
figuring
dramatically
and
upon
which
she
instantly
turned
her
back
as
soon
as
she
was
perceived
innes
gave
no
sign
even
of
preoccupation
if
she
had
bad
they
occurred
between
the
teas
and
tennises
the
picnics
luncheons
and
other
entertainments
at
which
you
could
always
count
upon
meeting
her
and
in
that
case
they
must
have
been
short
she
looked
extremely
well
and
her
admirable
frocks
gave
an
accent
even
to
birthday
functions
at
viceregal
lodge
which
were
quite
hopelessly
general
if
any
one
could
have
compelled
a
revelation
of
her
mind
i
think
it
would
have
transpired
that
her
anxieties
about
capt
valentine
drake
and
vesey
gave
her
no
leisure
for
lesser
ones
these
for
a
few
days
had
been
keen
and
indignant
captain
drake
had
so
far
forgotten
himself
as
to
ride
with
vesey
twice
since
innes
s
arrival
and
any
display
of
poverty
of
spirit
was
naturally
impossible
under
the
circumstances
the
moment
was
a
critical
one
captain
drake
seemed
inclined
to
place
her
in
the
category
of
old
unexacting
friends
ladies
who
looked
on
and
smiled
content
to
give
him
tea
on
rainy
days
and
call
him
by
his
christian
name
with
perhaps
the
privilege
of
a
tapping
finger
on
his
shoulder
and
an
occasional
order
about
a
rickshaw
violet
was
not
an
introspective
person
or
she
might
have
discovered
here
that
the
most
stable
part
of
her
was
her
exigence
with
captain
drake
she
found
out
quickly
enough
however
that
she
did
not
mean
to
discard
it
she
threw
herself
therefore
her
fine
shoulders
and
arms
her
pretty
clothes
her
hilarity
her
complexion
her
eyelashes
and
all
that
appertained
to
her
into
the
critical
task
of
making
other
men
believe
at
captain
drake
s
expense
that
they
were
quite
as
fond
of
her
as
he
was
vesey
took
opposite
measures
and
the
club
laid
bets
on
the
result
the
club
was
not
prepossessed
by
captain
drake
he
said
too
little
and
he
implied
too
much
he
had
magnificent
shoulders
which
he
bent
a
great
deal
over
secluded
sofas
and
a
very
languid
interest
in
matters
over
which
ordinary
men
were
enthusiastic
he
seemed
to
believe
that
if
he
smiled
all
the
way
across
his
face
he
would
damage
a
conventionality
his
clothes
were
unexceptionable
and
he
always
did
the
right
thing
though
bored
by
the
necessity
he
was
in
an
ugly
way
which
gave
him
an
air
of
restrained
capacity
for
melodrama
and
made
women
think
him
interesting
somebody
with
a
knack
of
disparagement
said
that
he
was
too
much
expressed
it
rather
added
to
his
unpopularity
that
he
was
a
man
whom
women
usually
took
with
preposterous
seriousness
all
but
kitty
vesey
who
charmed
and
held
him
by
her
outrageous
liberties
when
vesey
chaffed
him
he
felt
picturesque
he
was
also
aware
of
inspiring
entertainment
for
the
with
the
feeling
at
such
times
that
he
too
was
an
amused
spectator
this
was
of
course
their
public
attitude
in
private
there
was
sentiment
and
they
talked
about
the
tyranny
of
society
or
delivered
themselves
of
ideas
suggested
by
works
of
fiction
which
everybody
simply
had
to
read
for
a
week
innes
looked
on
apparently
indifferent
rather
apparently
not
observing
and
an
assistant
secretary
in
the
home
department
began
to
fancy
that
his
patience
in
teaching
the
three
dachshund
puppies
tricks
was
really
appreciated
he
was
an
assistant
secretary
with
other
conspicuous
parts
and
hitherto
his
time
had
been
too
valuable
to
spend
upon
ladies
dachshunds
innes
had
selected
him
well
there
came
an
evening
when
at
a
dance
at
the
s
innes
was
so
absorbed
in
what
the
assistant
secretary
was
saying
to
her
as
she
passed
on
his
arm
that
she
did
not
see
captain
drake
in
the
corridor
at
all
although
he
had
carefully
broken
an
engagement
to
walk
with
kitty
vesey
that
very
afternoon
as
the
beginning
of
gradual
and
painless
reform
in
her
direction
his
unrewarded
virtue
rose
up
and
surprised
him
with
the
distinctness
of
its
resentment
and
while
his
expression
was
successfully
amused
his
shoulders
and
the
back
of
his
neck
as
well
as
the
hand
on
his
moustache
spoke
of
discipline
which
promised
to
be
efficient
reflection
assured
him
that
discipline
was
after
all
deserved
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
found
him
wagging
his
tail
so
to
speak
over
innes
s
programme
in
a
corner
pleasantly
isolated
the
other
chair
was
occupied
by
the
assistant
secretary
captain
drake
represented
an
interruption
and
was
obliged
to
take
a
step
towards
the
nearest
lamp
to
read
the
card
three
dances
were
rather
ostentatiously
left
and
drake
initialled
them
all
he
brought
back
the
card
with
a
bow
which
spoke
of
dignity
under
bitter
usage
together
with
the
inflexible
intention
of
courteous
and
turned
away
oh
if
you
please
captain
drake
let
me
see
what
you
ve
done
all
those
but
isn
t
it
after
eleven
innes
asked
the
assistant
secretary
with
a
timid
smile
he
was
enjoying
himself
but
he
had
a
respect
for
vested
interests
and
those
of
captain
drake
were
so
well
known
that
he
felt
a
little
like
a
buccaneer
dear
me
so
it
is
innes
glanced
at
one
of
her
bracelets
then
captain
drake
i
m
sorry
she
carefully
crossed
out
the
three
s
i
promised
all
the
dances
i
had
left
after
ten
to
holmcroft
most
of
the
others
i
gave
away
at
the
gymkhana
really
why
weren
t
you
there
that
persian
tutor
again
i
m
afraid
you
are
working
too
hard
and
what
did
the
rani
do
holmcroft
it
s
like
the
arabian
nights
only
with
real
jewels
oh
i
say
holmcroft
this
is
too
much
luck
you
know
regular
sweepstakes
by
jove
and
captain
drake
lingered
on
the
fringe
of
the
situation
perhaps
i
have
been
greedy
said
the
assistant
secretary
deprecatingly
i
ll
not
in
the
very
least
that
is
exclaimed
violet
pouting
if
i
m
to
be
considered
we
ll
sit
out
all
but
the
waltzes
and
you
shall
tell
me
official
secrets
about
the
rani
she
put
us
up
once
she
s
a
delicious
old
thing
gave
us
string
beds
to
sleep
on
and
gold
plate
to
eat
from
and
swore
about
every
other
word
she
had
been
investing
in
government
paper
and
it
had
dropped
three
points
just
my
damn
luck
she
said
wasn
t
it
exquisite
captain
drake
mrs
innes
i
don
t
want
to
be
rude
but
you
re
a
dreadful
embarrassment
holmcroft
won
t
tell
you
official
secrets
if
she
would
only
behave
thought
madeline
looking
on
i
would
tell
her
indeed
i
would
at
colonel
innes
detached
himself
from
a
group
of
men
in
mess
dress
as
she
appeared
with
the
worsleys
and
let
himself
drift
with
the
tide
that
brought
them
always
together
you
are
looking
tired
ill
she
said
seriously
as
they
sought
the
unconfessed
solace
of
each
other
s
eyes
last
night
it
was
the
s
and
the
night
before
the
dance
at
peliti
s
and
again
tonight
and
you
are
not
like
those
of
us
who
can
rest
next
morning
you
have
always
your
heavy
office
work
she
spoke
with
indignant
tender
reproach
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
hearing
it
you
will
have
to
take
leave
and
go
away
she
insisted
foolishly
leave
good
heavens
no
i
wish
all
our
fellows
were
as
fit
as
i
am
and
yes
she
said
don
t
pity
me
dear
friend
i
don
t
think
it
s
good
for
me
the
world
really
uses
me
very
then
it
s
all
right
i
suppose
madeline
said
with
sudden
depression
of
course
it
is
you
are
dining
with
us
on
the
eighth
i
m
afraid
not
i
m
engaged
again
don
t
you
want
to
break
bread
in
my
house
miss
anderson
she
was
silent
and
he
insisted
tell
me
he
said
she
gave
him
instead
a
kind
mysterious
smile
i
will
explain
to
you
what
i
feel
about
that
some
day
she
said
some
day
soon
i
can
t
accept
innes
s
invitation
for
the
eighth
but
brookes
and
i
are
going
to
take
tea
with
the
fakir
s
monkeys
on
the
top
of
jakko
tomorrow
anybody
else
or
only
brookes
only
and
she
thought
she
had
abandoned
coquetry
then
may
i
come
indeed
you
i
really
don
t
know
reflected
madeline
as
she
caught
another
glimpse
of
innes
vigorously
dancing
the
reel
opposite
little
lord
billy
in
his
highland
uniform
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
that
i
am
behaving
very
well
chapter
horace
innes
looked
round
his
wife
s
as
if
he
were
making
an
inventory
of
it
carefully
giving
each
article
its
value
which
happened
however
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
rupees
madeline
anderson
had
been
saying
something
the
day
before
about
the
intimacy
and
accuracy
with
which
people
s
walls
expressed
them
and
though
the
commonplace
was
not
new
to
him
this
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
led
him
to
scan
his
wife
s
what
he
saw
may
be
imagined
but
his
only
distinct
reflection
was
that
he
had
no
idea
that
she
had
been
photographed
so
variously
or
had
so
many
friends
who
wore
resplendent
staff
uniforms
the
relation
of
cheapness
in
porcelain
ornaments
to
the
lady
s
individuality
was
beyond
him
and
he
could
not
analyze
his
feelings
of
sitting
in
the
midst
of
her
poverty
of
spirit
indeed
thinking
of
his
ordinary
unsusceptibility
to
such
things
he
told
himself
sharply
that
he
was
adding
an
affectation
of
discomfort
to
the
others
that
he
had
to
bear
and
that
if
madeline
had
not
given
him
the
idea
it
would
never
have
entered
his
mind
the
less
he
mused
that
one
had
to
do
with
finicking
feelings
in
this
world
the
better
they
were
well
enough
for
people
who
were
tolerably
conditioned
in
essentials
he
preferred
this
vagueness
even
with
himself
in
connection
with
his
marriage
otherwise
they
added
pricks
besides
he
had
that
other
matter
to
think
of
he
thought
of
the
other
matter
with
such
obvious
irritation
that
the
butler
coming
in
to
say
that
the
english
water
was
finished
and
how
many
dozen
should
he
order
put
a
chair
in
its
place
instead
closed
the
door
softly
again
and
went
away
it
was
not
good
for
the
dignity
of
butlers
to
ask
questions
of
any
sort
with
a
look
of
that
kind
under
the
eyebrows
of
the
sahib
the
matter
was
not
serious
colonel
innes
told
himself
but
he
would
prefer
by
comparison
to
deal
with
matters
that
were
serious
he
knew
simla
well
enough
to
attach
no
overwhelming
importance
to
things
said
about
women
at
the
club
where
the
broadest
charity
prevailed
underneath
and
the
idle
comment
of
the
moment
had
an
intrinsic
value
as
a
distraction
rather
than
a
reflective
one
as
a
criticism
this
consideration
however
was
more
philosophical
in
connection
with
other
men
s
wives
he
found
very
little
in
it
to
palliate
what
he
had
overheard
submerged
in
the
times
of
india
that
afternoon
and
to
put
an
edge
on
it
the
thing
had
been
said
by
one
of
his
own
juniors
luckily
the
boy
had
left
the
room
without
discovering
who
was
behind
the
times
of
india
innes
felt
that
he
should
be
grateful
for
having
been
spared
the
exigency
of
defending
his
wife
against
a
flippant
word
to
which
she
had
very
probably
laid
herself
open
he
was
very
angry
and
it
is
perhaps
not
surprising
that
he
did
not
pause
to
consider
how
far
his
anger
was
due
to
the
humiliating
necessity
of
speaking
to
her
about
it
she
was
coming
at
last
though
she
was
in
the
hall
he
would
get
it
over
quickly
goodbye
said
innes
at
the
door
no
i
can
t
possibly
let
you
come
in
to
tea
i
don
t
know
how
you
have
the
conscience
after
drinking
three
cups
at
mickie
s
where
i
had
no
business
to
take
you
tomorrow
oh
all
right
if
you
want
to
very
badly
but
i
won
t
promise
you
strawberries
they
re
nearly
all
there
was
the
sound
of
a
departing
pony
s
trot
and
innes
came
into
the
good
heavens
horace
what
are
you
sitting
there
for
like
a
like
a
ghost
why
didn
t
you
make
a
noise
or
something
and
why
aren
t
you
at
office
i
can
t
tell
you
how
you
startled
it
is
early
colonel
innes
said
we
are
neither
of
us
in
the
house
as
a
rule
at
this
coincidence
violet
turned
a
cool
searching
glance
on
her
husband
and
held
herself
ready
i
came
home
early
because
i
want
to
alter
the
lace
on
my
yellow
bodice
for
tonight
it
s
too
disgusting
as
it
is
but
i
was
rather
glad
to
get
away
from
mickie
s
lot
so
rowdy
and
i
came
because
i
had
a
special
reason
for
wanting
to
speak
to
violet
s
lips
parted
and
her
breath
in
spite
of
herself
came
a
little
faster
as
we
are
dining
out
tonight
i
thought
that
if
i
didn
t
catch
you
now
i
might
not
have
another
opportunity
till
tomorrow
and
it
s
always
a
pity
to
spoil
one
s
breakfast
i
can
tell
from
your
manner
mon
ami
it
s
something
disagreeable
what
have
i
been
and
gone
and
done
she
was
dancing
poor
thing
in
her
little
vulgar
way
on
hot
iron
but
her
eyes
kept
their
inconsistent
coolness
i
heard
something
today
which
you
are
not
in
the
way
of
hearing
you
have
probably
no
conception
that
it
could
be
then
she
has
been
telling
other
people
absolutely
the
worst
thing
she
could
do
innes
exclaimed
privately
sitting
unmoved
her
face
a
little
too
expectant
you
won
t
be
prepared
for
it
you
may
be
shocked
and
hurt
by
it
indeed
i
think
there
is
no
need
to
repeat
it
to
you
but
i
must
put
you
on
your
guard
men
are
coarser
you
know
than
women
they
are
apt
to
put
their
own
interpretation
what
is
it
there
was
a
physical
gasp
a
sharpness
in
her
voice
that
brought
innes
s
eyes
from
the
floor
to
her
face
i
am
sorry
he
said
but
don
t
overestimate
it
don
t
let
it
worry
you
it
was
simply
a
very
impertinent
a
very
disagreeable
reference
to
you
and
holmcroft
i
think
in
connection
with
the
dovedell
s
picnic
it
was
a
particularly
silly
thing
as
well
and
i
am
sure
no
one
would
attach
any
importance
to
it
but
it
was
said
openly
at
the
club
and
who
said
it
innes
demanded
a
flood
of
colour
rushed
over
her
face
horace
marked
that
she
blushed
i
don
t
know
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
violet
it
certainly
was
not
meant
for
your
if
i
m
not
to
know
who
said
it
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
pay
any
attention
to
it
mere
idle
rumour
innes
bit
his
lip
captain
gordon
said
it
he
replied
bobby
gordon
do
tell
me
what
he
said
i
m
dying
to
know
was
he
very
disagreeable
i
did
give
his
dance
away
on
thursday
innes
looked
at
her
with
the
curious
distrust
which
she
often
inspired
in
him
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
put
her
out
of
the
room
into
a
place
by
herself
and
keep
her
there
i
won
t
repeat
what
he
colonel
innes
took
up
the
saturday
review
oh
do
horace
i
particularly
want
to
innes
said
nothing
horace
was
it
was
it
anything
about
holmcroft
being
my
secretariat
if
you
adorn
your
guess
with
a
little
profanity
said
innes
acidly
you
won
t
be
far
violet
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
why
you
old
goose
she
articulated
behind
her
handkerchief
he
said
that
to
innes
laid
down
the
saturday
review
to
you
he
repeated
gordon
said
it
to
you
rather
violet
was
still
mirthful
i
m
not
sure
that
he
didn
t
call
poor
little
homie
something
worse
than
that
it
s
the
purest
jealousy
on
his
part
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
the
fourth
skin
which
enables
so
many
of
us
to
be
callous
to
all
but
the
relative
meaning
of
careless
phrases
had
not
been
given
to
innes
and
her
words
fell
upon
his
bare
sense
of
propriety
jealous
he
said
of
a
married
woman
i
find
that
difficult
to
violet
s
face
straightened
out
don
t
be
absurd
horace
these
boys
are
always
jealous
of
somebody
or
other
it
s
the
occupation
of
their
lives
i
really
don
t
see
how
one
can
prevent
it
seems
to
me
that
a
woman
should
see
how
your
point
of
view
in
these
matters
is
perhaps
violet
was
driven
by
righteous
anger
to
say
you
find
miss
anderson
s
easier
to
colonel
innes
s
face
took
its
regimental
disciplinary
look
and
though
his
eyes
were
aroused
his
words
were
quiet
with
repression
i
see
no
reason
to
discuss
miss
anderson
with
you
he
said
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
we
are
talking
oh
don
t
you
really
hasn
t
she
indeed
i
take
it
you
are
trying
to
make
me
believe
that
compromising
things
are
said
about
holmcroft
and
me
at
the
club
well
i
advise
you
to
keep
your
ears
open
a
little
more
and
listen
to
the
things
said
about
you
and
madeline
anderson
there
but
i
don
t
suppose
you
would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
repeat
them
to
innes
turned
very
white
and
the
rigidity
of
his
face
gave
place
to
heavy
dismay
his
look
was
that
of
a
man
upon
whom
misfortune
had
fallen
out
of
a
clear
sky
for
an
instant
he
stared
at
his
wife
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
altered
for
god
s
sake
he
said
let
us
have
done
with
this
pitiful
wrangling
i
dare
say
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
at
all
events
i
only
meant
to
warn
you
but
now
you
must
tell
me
exactly
what
you
mean
by
this
that
you
have
said
this
about
the
fat
s
in
the
fire
was
innes
s
reflection
certainly
i
ll
tell
you
don
t
shout
please
i
mean
simply
that
all
simla
is
talking
about
your
affair
with
miss
anderson
you
may
imagine
that
because
you
are
fifteen
years
older
than
she
is
things
won
t
be
thought
of
but
they
are
and
i
hear
it
s
been
spoken
about
at
viceregal
lodge
i
know
lady
bloomfield
has
noticed
it
for
she
herself
mentioned
it
to
me
i
told
her
i
hadn
t
the
slightest
objection
and
neither
have
i
but
there
s
an
old
proverb
about
people
in
glass
houses
what
are
you
going
to
do
colonel
innes
s
expression
was
certainly
alarming
and
he
had
made
a
step
toward
her
that
had
menace
in
it
i
am
going
out
he
said
and
turned
and
left
her
to
her
triumph
chapter
she
violet
had
unspeakably
vulgarized
it
but
it
must
be
true
it
must
be
to
some
extent
true
she
may
even
have
lied
about
it
but
the
truth
was
there
fundamentally
in
the
mere
fact
that
it
had
been
suggested
to
her
imagination
madeline
s
name
which
had
come
to
be
for
him
an
epitome
of
what
was
finest
and
most
valuable
most
to
be
lived
for
was
dropping
from
men
s
lips
into
a
kind
of
an
abyss
of
dishonourable
suggestion
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
or
around
it
it
was
a
cloud
which
encompassed
them
suddenly
blackening
down
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
do
nothing
except
yes
of
course
that
was
obvious
as
obvious
as
any
other
plain
duty
through
his
selfishness
it
had
a
beginning
in
spite
of
his
selfishness
it
should
have
an
end
that
went
without
saying
no
more
walks
or
rides
in
a
conventional
way
perhaps
but
nothing
deliberate
designed
and
never
alone
together
gossip
about
flippant
married
women
was
bad
enough
but
that
it
should
concern
itself
with
an
unprotected
creature
like
madeline
was
monstrous
incredible
he
strode
fiercely
into
the
road
round
jakko
and
no
little
harmless
snake
if
it
had
crawled
across
his
path
would
have
failed
to
suffer
a
quick
fate
under
the
guidance
of
his
imagination
but
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
kill
and
he
turned
upon
himself
the
sun
went
down
into
the
punjab
and
left
great
hill
worlds
barring
the
passage
behind
him
the
deodars
sank
waist
deep
into
filmy
shadow
and
the
yellow
afterlight
lay
silently
among
the
branches
a
monkey
lopading
across
the
road
with
a
great
show
of
prudence
seemed
to
have
strayed
into
an
unfamiliar
country
and
the
rustling
twigs
behind
him
made
an
episode
of
sound
the
road
in
perpetual
curve
between
its
little
stone
parapet
and
the
broad
flank
of
the
hill
rose
and
fell
under
the
deodars
innes
took
its
slopes
and
its
steepnesses
with
even
unslackened
stride
aware
of
no
difference
aware
of
little
indeed
except
the
physical
necessity
of
movement
spurred
on
by
a
futile
instinct
that
the
end
of
his
walk
would
be
the
end
of
his
trouble
his
amazing
black
menacing
trouble
a
pony
s
trot
behind
him
struck
through
the
silence
like
all
jakko
seemed
to
echo
with
it
and
it
came
nearer
insistent
purposeful
but
he
was
hardly
aware
of
it
until
the
creature
pulled
up
beside
him
and
madeline
slipping
quickly
off
said
i
m
coming
he
took
off
his
hat
and
stared
at
her
she
seemed
to
represent
a
climax
i
m
coming
too
she
said
i
m
tired
of
picking
flies
off
the
turk
and
he
s
really
unbearable
about
them
tonight
here
she
threw
the
reins
to
the
man
and
turned
to
innes
with
a
smile
of
relief
i
would
much
rather
do
a
walk
why
you
want
me
to
come
too
don
t
you
his
face
was
all
one
negative
and
under
the
unexpectedness
of
it
and
the
amazement
of
it
her
questioning
eyes
slowly
filled
with
sudden
uncontrollable
tears
so
that
she
had
to
lower
them
and
look
steadily
at
the
in
the
road
while
she
waited
for
his
answer
you
know
how
i
feel
about
seeing
you
how
glad
i
always
am
he
stammered
but
there
are
reasons
reasons
she
repeated
half
audibly
i
don
t
know
how
to
tell
you
i
will
write
but
let
me
put
you
up
again
i
will
not
madeline
said
with
a
sob
i
won
t
be
sent
home
like
a
child
i
am
going
to
walk
but
but
i
can
quite
well
go
she
started
forward
and
her
foot
caught
in
her
habit
so
that
she
made
an
awkward
stumble
and
came
down
on
her
knee
in
rising
she
stumbled
again
and
his
quick
arm
was
necessary
looking
down
at
her
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
bitterly
the
tension
had
lasted
long
and
the
snap
had
come
when
she
least
expected
it
stop
innes
said
firmly
hardly
daring
to
turn
his
head
and
ascertain
the
blessed
fact
that
they
were
still
alone
stop
instantly
you
shall
not
go
by
he
flicked
the
dust
off
her
habit
with
his
come
please
we
will
go
on
her
distress
seemed
to
make
things
simple
again
it
was
as
if
the
cloud
that
hung
over
them
had
melted
as
she
wept
and
lifted
and
drifted
a
little
further
on
for
the
moment
naturally
nothing
mattered
except
that
she
should
be
comforted
as
she
walked
by
his
side
shaken
with
her
effort
at
he
had
to
resist
the
impulse
to
touch
her
his
hand
tingled
to
do
its
part
in
soothing
her
his
arm
ached
to
protect
her
while
he
vaguely
felt
an
element
of
right
of
justice
in
her
tears
they
were
in
a
manner
his
own
what
he
did
was
to
turn
and
ask
the
syce
following
if
he
had
loosened
the
turk
s
i
shall
be
better
in
a
moment
madeline
said
and
he
answered
of
course
but
they
walked
on
and
said
nothing
more
until
the
road
ran
out
from
under
the
last
deodar
and
round
the
first
bare
boulder
that
marked
the
beginning
of
the
ladies
mile
it
lay
rolled
out
before
them
the
ladies
mile
sinuous
and
grey
and
empty
along
the
face
of
the
cliff
they
could
see
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
it
was
the
bleak
side
of
jakko
even
tonight
there
was
a
fresh
springing
coldness
in
it
blowing
over
from
the
hidden
snows
behind
the
rims
of
the
nearer
hills
madeline
held
up
her
face
to
it
and
gave
herself
a
moment
of
its
grateful
discipline
i
have
been
as
foolish
as
possible
she
said
as
foolish
as
possible
i
have
distressed
you
well
i
couldn
t
help
it
that
is
all
there
is
to
be
said
now
if
you
will
tell
me
what
is
in
your
mind
what
you
spoke
of
writing
i
will
mount
again
and
go
home
it
doesn
t
matter
i
know
you
didn
t
mean
to
be
her
lip
was
trembling
again
and
he
knew
it
and
dared
not
look
at
it
how
can
you
ask
me
to
tell
you
miserable
things
he
exclaimed
how
can
i
find
the
words
and
i
have
only
just
been
told
i
can
hardly
myself
conceive
it
i
am
not
a
child
in
her
teens
that
my
ears
should
be
guarded
from
miserable
things
i
have
come
of
age
i
have
entered
into
my
inheritance
of
the
world
s
bitterness
with
the
rest
i
can
listen
madeline
said
why
not
he
looked
to
her
with
grave
tenderness
you
think
yourself
very
old
and
very
wise
about
the
world
he
said
but
you
are
a
woman
and
you
will
be
hurt
and
when
i
think
that
a
little
ordinary
forethought
on
my
part
would
have
protected
you
i
feel
like
the
criminal
i
don
t
make
too
much
of
it
she
said
simply
i
have
a
presentiment
i
ll
tell
you
innes
said
slowly
i
won
t
niggle
about
it
the
people
of
this
place
idiots
are
unable
to
believe
that
a
man
and
a
woman
can
be
to
each
other
what
we
yes
said
madeline
she
paused
beside
the
parapet
and
looked
down
at
the
indistinct
little
fields
below
and
the
blurred
masses
of
white
wild
roses
waving
midway
against
the
precipice
they
can
not
understand
that
there
can
be
any
higher
plane
of
intercourse
between
us
than
the
one
they
know
they
won
t
see
they
can
t
see
that
the
satisfaction
we
find
in
being
together
is
of
a
different
i
see
said
madeline
she
had
raised
her
eyes
and
they
sought
the
solemn
lines
of
the
horizon
she
looked
as
if
she
saw
something
infinitely
lifted
above
the
pettiness
he
retailed
to
her
so
they
say
good
god
why
should
i
tell
you
what
they
say
it
suddenly
flashed
upon
him
that
the
embodiment
of
it
in
words
would
be
at
once
from
him
sacrilegious
and
ludicrous
it
flashed
upon
him
that
her
natural
anger
would
bring
him
pain
and
that
if
she
laughed
it
was
so
hard
to
tell
when
she
would
laugh
it
would
be
as
if
she
struck
him
he
cast
about
him
dumb
and
helpless
while
she
kept
her
invincibly
quiet
gaze
upon
the
farther
hills
she
was
thinking
that
this
breath
of
gossip
now
that
it
had
blown
was
a
very
slight
affair
compared
with
horace
innes
s
misery
which
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
then
her
soul
rose
up
in
her
brushing
everything
aside
and
forgetting
alas
the
vow
it
had
once
made
to
her
i
think
i
know
she
said
they
are
indeed
foolish
they
say
that
we
love
each
other
is
not
that
what
they
say
he
looked
in
amazement
into
her
tender
eyes
and
caught
at
the
little
mocking
smile
about
her
lips
suddenly
the
world
grew
light
about
him
the
shadows
fled
away
somewhere
down
in
the
valley
he
remembered
afterward
a
made
music
when
he
spoke
it
was
almost
in
a
whisper
lest
he
should
disturb
some
newly
perceived
lovely
thing
that
had
wings
and
might
leave
him
oh
madeline
he
said
is
it
true
she
only
smiled
on
in
gladness
that
took
no
heed
of
any
apprehension
any
fear
or
scruple
and
he
himself
keeping
his
eyes
upon
her
face
said
it
is
so
they
stood
for
a
little
time
in
silence
while
she
resisted
her
great
opportunity
she
resisted
it
to
the
end
and
presently
beckoned
to
the
syce
who
came
up
leading
the
pony
innes
mounted
her
mechanically
and
said
is
that
all
right
as
she
put
her
foot
in
the
stirrup
without
knowing
that
he
had
spoken
goodbye
she
said
i
am
going
away
immediately
it
will
be
better
and
listen
i
have
known
this
for
weeks
and
i
have
gone
on
seeing
you
and
i
hope
i
am
not
any
more
wicked
than
i
feel
goodbye
he
said
taking
his
hand
from
the
pony
s
neck
and
she
rode
buoyantly
away
he
turning
to
breast
the
road
again
saw
darkness
gathering
over
the
end
of
it
and
drawing
nearer
at
eleven
o
clock
next
morning
brookes
rose
from
her
packing
to
take
a
note
addressed
to
her
mistress
from
the
hand
of
a
messenger
in
the
imperial
red
and
gold
it
ran
dear
miss
anderson
i
write
to
tell
you
that
i
have
obtained
three
weeks
leave
and
i
am
going
into
the
interior
to
shoot
starting
this
afternoon
you
spoke
yesterday
of
leaving
simla
almost
immediately
i
trust
you
will
not
do
this
as
it
would
be
extremely
risky
to
venture
down
to
the
plains
just
now
in
ten
days
the
rains
will
have
broken
when
it
will
be
safe
pray
wait
till
then
yours
sincerely
horace
involuntarily
the
letter
found
its
way
to
madeline
s
lips
and
remained
there
until
she
saw
the
maid
observing
her
with
intelligence
brookes
she
said
i
am
strongly
advised
not
to
start
until
the
rains
break
i
think
on
the
whole
that
we
won
indeed
miss
returned
brookes
mrs
sergeant
simmons
told
me
that
it
was
courting
cholera
to
go
and
nothing
short
of
it
i
must
say
i
m
chapter
a
week
later
colonel
innes
had
got
his
leave
and
had
left
simla
for
the
by
what
is
facetiously
known
as
the
carriage
road
to
madeline
had
done
as
she
was
bidden
and
was
waiting
for
the
rains
to
break
another
day
had
come
without
them
to
write
and
tell
innes
to
write
to
tell
violet
to
go
away
and
leave
the
situation
as
she
found
it
she
had
lived
and
moved
and
slept
and
awakened
to
these
alternatives
at
the
moment
she
slept
it
was
early
very
early
in
the
morning
the
hills
all
about
seemed
still
unaware
of
it
standing
in
the
greyness
compact
silent
immutable
as
if
they
slept
with
their
eyes
open
nothing
spoke
of
the
oncoming
sun
nothing
was
yet
surprised
the
hill
world
lifted
itself
unconscious
in
a
pale
solution
of
daylight
and
only
on
the
very
far
away
it
rippled
into
a
cloud
the
flimsy
town
clinging
steeply
roof
above
roof
to
the
slope
mounting
to
the
saddle
and
slipping
over
on
the
other
side
cut
the
dawn
with
innumerable
little
lines
and
angles
all
in
one
tone
like
a
pencil
drawing
there
was
no
feeling
in
it
no
expression
it
had
a
temporary
air
in
that
light
like
trampled
snow
and
even
the
big
secretariat
buildings
that
raised
themselves
here
and
there
out
of
the
huddling
bazaar
looked
trivial
childish
enterprises
in
the
simple
revelation
of
the
morning
a
cold
silence
was
abroad
which
a
crow
now
and
then
vainly
tried
to
disturb
with
a
note
of
tentative
enterprise
forced
premature
it
announced
that
the
sun
would
probably
rise
but
nothing
more
in
the
little
dark
shops
of
the
an
occasional
indefinite
figure
moved
groping
among
last
night
s
tools
or
an
old
woman
in
a
red
sari
washed
a
brass
dish
over
the
shallow
open
drain
that
ran
past
her
door
at
the
tonga
terminus
below
the
mall
a
couple
of
coughing
syces
muffled
in
their
blankets
pulled
one
of
these
vehicles
out
of
the
shed
they
pushed
it
about
sleepily
with
clumsy
futility
nothing
else
stirred
or
spoke
at
all
in
simla
nothing
disturbed
miss
anderson
asleep
in
her
hotel
a
brown
figure
in
a
with
a
burden
appeared
where
the
road
turned
down
from
the
mall
and
then
another
and
several
following
they
were
coolies
and
they
carried
luggage
the
first
to
arrive
beside
the
tonga
bent
and
loosed
the
trunk
he
brought
which
slipped
from
his
back
to
the
ground
the
syces
looked
at
him
saying
nothing
and
he
straightened
himself
against
the
wall
of
the
hillside
also
in
silence
it
was
too
early
for
conversation
thus
did
all
the
others
when
the
last
portmanteau
had
been
deposited
a
heap
on
the
shed
floor
rose
up
as
a
punjabi
driver
and
walked
round
the
luggage
looking
at
it
and
you
owls
brethren
he
said
with
sarcasm
addressing
the
first
coolie
you
have
undertaken
to
carry
these
matter
kos
to
kalka
have
you
na
replied
the
coolie
stolidly
and
spat
how
else
then
is
it
to
be
taken
the
driver
cried
with
anger
in
his
argument
behold
the
memsahib
has
ordered
but
one
tonga
and
a
of
an
ekka
here
is
work
for
six
tongas
what
reason
is
there
in
this
the
coolie
folded
his
naked
arms
and
dug
in
the
dust
with
an
unconcerned
toe
i
what
can
i
do
he
said
it
is
the
order
of
the
ram
singh
grunted
and
said
no
more
a
rickshaw
was
coming
down
from
the
mall
and
the
memsahib
was
in
it
ten
minutes
later
the
ponies
stood
in
their
traces
under
the
iron
bar
and
the
lady
sat
in
the
tonga
behind
ram
singh
her
runners
in
uniform
waited
beside
the
empty
rickshaw
with
a
puzzled
look
at
which
she
laughed
and
threw
a
rupee
to
the
head
man
the
luggage
was
piled
and
corded
on
three
ekkas
behind
and
their
drivers
too
were
ready
chellao
she
cried
crisply
and
ram
singh
imperturbably
lifted
the
reins
the
little
procession
clanked
and
jingled
along
the
hillside
always
tending
down
and
broke
upon
the
early
grey
melancholy
with
a
forced
and
futile
cheerfulness
too
early
like
everything
else
as
it
passed
the
last
of
simla
s
little
gardens
spread
like
a
on
the
side
of
the
hill
the
lady
leaned
forward
and
looked
back
as
if
she
wished
to
impress
the
place
upon
her
memory
her
expression
was
that
of
a
person
going
forth
without
demur
into
the
day
s
hazards
ready
to
cope
with
them
yet
there
was
some
regret
in
the
backward
look
it
s
a
place
she
said
aloud
where
everybody
has
a
good
time
then
the
amusement
club
went
out
of
sight
behind
a
curve
and
she
settled
herself
more
comfortably
among
her
cushions
and
drew
a
wrap
round
her
to
meet
the
chill
wind
of
the
valley
it
was
all
behind
her
the
lady
looked
out
as
the
ponies
galloped
up
to
the
first
and
seeing
a
saddled
horse
held
by
a
syce
cramped
herself
a
little
into
one
corner
to
make
room
the
seat
would
just
hold
two
ram
singh
salaamed
getting
down
to
harness
the
fresh
pair
and
a
man
put
his
face
in
at
the
side
of
the
tonga
and
took
off
his
hat
are
you
all
right
he
said
his
smile
was
as
conscious
as
his
words
were
casual
quite
right
the
ayah
was
silly
about
coming
didn
t
want
to
leave
her
babies
or
something
so
i
had
to
leave
her
behind
everything
else
is
either
here
or
in
the
the
brute
never
mind
they
re
not
much
use
in
a
railway
journey
you
can
pick
up
another
at
bombay
then
i
suppose
i
d
better
get
i
suppose
you
better
had
unless
you
think
of
walking
she
laughed
and
he
took
the
place
beside
her
ram
singh
again
unquestioningly
took
up
the
reins
nobody
else
going
down
not
another
soul
we
might
just
as
well
have
started
oh
well
we
couldn
t
tell
beastly
awkward
if
there
had
been
yes
she
said
but
thrust
up
her
under
lip
indifferently
then
with
the
effect
of
turning
to
the
business
in
hand
she
bent
her
eyes
upon
him
understandingly
and
smiled
in
frank
reference
to
something
that
had
not
been
mentioned
it
s
goodbye
simla
isn
t
it
she
said
he
smiled
in
response
and
put
his
hand
upon
her
firm
round
arm
possessively
and
they
began
to
talk
ram
singh
all
unaware
kept
his
horses
at
their
steady
clanking
downward
gallop
and
simla
clinging
to
the
hilltops
was
brushed
by
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
it
came
a
gloriously
clear
morning
early
riders
round
jakko
saw
the
real
india
lying
beyond
the
outer
ranges
flat
and
blue
and
pictured
with
forests
and
rivers
like
a
map
the
plains
were
pretty
and
interesting
in
this
aspect
but
nobody
found
them
attractive
sensitive
people
liked
it
better
when
the
heat
mist
veiled
them
and
it
was
possible
to
look
abroad
without
a
sudden
painful
thought
of
contrasting
temperatures
we
may
suppose
that
the
inhabitants
of
paradise
sometimes
grieve
over
their
luck
even
madeline
anderson
whose
heart
knew
no
constriction
at
the
remembrance
of
brother
or
husband
at
some
cruel
point
in
the
blue
expanse
had
come
to
turn
her
head
more
willingly
the
other
way
towards
the
hills
rolling
up
to
the
snows
being
a
woman
who
suffered
by
proxy
and
by
observation
and
by
rudyard
kipling
on
this
particular
morning
however
she
had
not
elected
to
do
either
she
slept
late
instead
and
was
glad
to
sleep
i
might
as
well
say
at
once
that
on
the
night
before
she
had
made
up
her
mind
had
brought
herself
to
the
point
and
had
written
to
innes
at
two
gables
all
the
facts
in
so
far
as
she
was
acquainted
with
them
connected
with
frederick
prendergast
s
death
she
was
very
much
ashamed
of
herself
poor
girl
she
was
aware
that
through
her
postponement
horace
innes
would
now
see
his
problem
in
all
its
bitterness
make
his
choice
with
his
eyes
wide
open
if
it
had
only
happened
before
he
knew
anything
about
her
she
charged
herself
with
having
deliberately
waited
and
then
spent
an
exhausting
hour
trying
to
believe
that
she
had
drifted
unconsciously
to
the
point
of
their
mutual
confession
whatever
the
truth
was
she
did
not
hesitate
to
recognize
a
new
voice
in
her
private
counsels
from
that
hour
urging
her
in
one
way
or
another
to
bring
matters
to
an
end
it
was
a
strong
instinct
looking
at
the
facts
she
saw
it
was
the
gambler
s
when
she
tried
to
think
of
the
ethical
considerations
involved
she
saw
only
the
chances
the
air
seemed
to
throb
with
them
all
night
she
had
to
count
them
finally
to
get
rid
of
them
brookes
was
up
betimes
however
and
sent
off
the
letter
it
went
duly
by
surnoo
to
innes
at
two
gables
madeline
woke
at
seven
with
a
start
and
asked
if
it
had
gone
then
slept
again
contentedly
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
thing
was
finished
the
breakfast
gong
had
sounded
and
the
english
mail
had
arrived
before
she
opened
her
eyes
again
upon
the
day
s
issues
she
gave
it
her
somewhat
desultory
attention
while
brookes
did
her
hair
there
was
only
one
scrap
of
news
adele
mentioned
in
a
postscript
that
poor
prendergast
s
money
was
likely
to
go
to
a
distant
relative
it
having
transpired
that
he
died
without
leaving
a
will
she
is
sure
absolutely
sure
madeline
mused
to
answer
my
letter
in
person
she
will
be
here
within
an
hour
i
shall
have
this
to
tell
her
too
how
pleased
she
will
be
she
will
come
into
it
all
i
suppose
if
she
is
allowed
though
she
won
t
be
allowed
that
is
if
but
there
speculation
began
and
madeline
had
forbidden
herself
speculation
if
not
once
and
for
all
at
least
many
times
and
for
fifteen
minutes
no
reasonable
purpose
would
be
served
by
innes
s
visit
madeline
reflected
as
she
sat
waiting
in
the
little
room
opening
on
the
veranda
but
she
would
come
of
course
she
would
come
she
would
require
the
satisfaction
of
the
verbal
assurance
she
would
hope
to
extract
more
details
she
would
want
the
objectionable
gratification
of
talking
if
over
in
spite
of
any
assurance
she
would
believe
that
madeline
had
not
told
her
before
in
order
to
make
her
miserable
a
little
longer
than
she
need
be
but
after
all
her
impression
about
that
did
not
particularly
matter
it
couldn
t
possibly
be
a
pleasant
interview
yet
madeline
found
herself
impatient
for
it
surnoo
she
said
of
her
messenger
must
be
idling
on
his
way
back
in
the
bazaar
i
must
try
to
remember
to
fine
him
two
pice
surnoo
is
she
forgot
however
to
fine
surnoo
the
pad
of
his
bare
feet
sounded
along
the
veranda
almost
immediately
and
the
look
in
his
pahari
eyes
was
that
of
expected
reproach
and
ability
to
defend
himself
against
it
he
held
out
two
letters
at
arm
for
as
he
was
expected
to
bring
only
one
there
was
a
fault
in
this
and
all
his
domestic
traditions
told
him
that
he
might
be
chastened
one
was
addressed
to
madeline
in
innes
s
handwriting
the
other
she
saw
with
astonishment
was
her
own
communication
to
that
lady
her
own
letter
returned
surnoo
explained
volubly
all
the
way
along
the
veranda
and
in
the
flood
of
his
unknown
tongue
madeline
caught
a
sentence
or
two
the
memsahib
was
not
said
surnoo
clearly
he
could
not
deliver
a
letter
to
a
memsahib
who
was
not
therefore
surnoo
continued
i
have
brought
back
your
honour
s
letter
and
the
other
i
had
from
the
hand
of
the
memsahib
s
runner
the
runner
with
one
eye
who
was
on
the
road
to
bring
it
here
more
i
do
not
know
but
it
appears
that
the
memsahib
has
gone
to
her
father
and
mother
in
belaat
being
very
sorrowful
because
the
has
left
her
to
the
letter
will
tell
me
said
madeline
to
herself
fingering
it
enough
the
man
went
away
and
madeline
closed
and
locked
the
door
of
her
the
letter
would
tell
her
what
she
glanced
about
her
with
dissatisfaction
and
sought
the
greater
privacy
of
her
bedroom
where
also
she
locked
the
door
and
drew
the
muslin
curtain
across
the
window
she
laid
the
letter
on
the
and
kept
her
eyes
upon
it
while
she
unfastened
with
trembling
hands
the
brooch
at
her
neck
and
the
belt
at
her
waist
she
did
one
or
two
other
meaningless
things
as
if
she
wanted
to
gain
time
to
fortify
her
nerves
even
against
an
exhibition
before
herself
then
she
sat
down
with
her
back
towards
the
light
and
opened
the
letter
it
had
a
pink
look
and
a
scented
air
even
in
her
beating
suspense
madeline
held
it
a
little
farther
away
from
her
as
she
unfolded
it
and
it
ran
dear
miss
anderson
what
will
you
say
i
wonder
and
what
will
simla
say
when
you
know
that
captain
drake
and
i
have
determined
to
disregard
conventionalities
and
live
henceforward
only
for
one
another
i
am
all
packed
up
and
long
before
this
meets
your
eye
we
shall
have
taken
the
step
which
society
condemns
but
which
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
knowing
my
history
will
be
enough
to
sympathize
with
at
least
to
some
extent
that
is
the
reason
i
am
writing
to
you
rather
than
to
any
of
my
own
chums
and
also
of
course
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
telling
you
that
i
no
longer
care
what
you
do
about
letting
out
the
secret
of
my
marriage
to
frederick
prendergast
i
am
now
above
and
beyond
it
any
way
you
look
at
it
i
do
not
see
that
i
am
much
to
blame
as
i
never
have
been
colonel
innes
s
wife
there
can
be
no
harm
in
leaving
him
though
if
he
had
ever
been
sympathetic
or
understood
me
the
least
little
bit
i
might
have
felt
bound
to
him
but
he
has
never
been
able
to
evoke
the
finer
parts
of
my
nature
and
when
this
is
the
case
marriage
is
a
mere
miserable
fleshly
failure
you
may
say
why
try
it
a
third
time
but
my
union
with
val
will
be
different
i
have
never
been
fond
of
the
opposite
sex
so
far
as
that
goes
i
should
have
made
a
very
good
nun
but
for
a
long
time
valentine
drake
has
been
the
only
man
i
cared
to
have
come
within
a
mile
of
me
and
lately
we
have
discovered
that
we
are
absolutely
necessary
to
each
other
s
existence
on
the
higher
plane
i
don
t
care
much
what
simla
thinks
but
if
you
happen
to
be
talking
about
it
to
dear
lady
bloomfield
you
might
just
mention
this
val
has
eight
hundred
a
year
of
his
own
so
it
is
perfectly
practicable
of
course
he
will
send
in
his
papers
whatever
happens
val
and
i
will
never
bind
ourselves
in
any
way
we
both
think
it
wrong
and
enslaving
i
have
nothing
more
to
add
except
that
i
am
depending
on
you
to
explain
to
simla
that
i
never
was
innes
yours
sincerely
violet
prendergast
i
have
written
to
horace
telling
him
everything
about
everything
and
sent
my
letter
off
to
him
in
the
wilds
by
a
runner
if
you
see
him
you
might
try
and
smooth
him
down
i
don
t
want
him
coming
after
val
with
a
madeline
read
this
communication
through
twice
then
quietly
and
deliberately
she
lay
down
upon
the
bed
and
drew
herself
out
of
the
control
of
her
heart
by
the
hard
labour
of
thought
when
she
rose
she
had
decided
that
there
were
only
two
things
for
her
to
do
and
she
began
at
once
to
do
them
continuing
her
refuge
in
action
she
threw
her
little
rooms
open
again
and
walked
methodically
round
the
outer
one
collecting
the
odds
and
ends
of
indian
fabrics
with
which
she
had
garnished
it
as
the
maid
came
in
she
looked
up
from
folding
them
i
have
news
brookes
she
said
that
necessitates
my
going
home
at
once
no
it
is
not
bad
news
but
important
i
will
go
now
and
see
about
the
tonga
we
must
start
tomorrow
brookes
called
surnoo
and
the
rickshaw
came
round
madeline
looked
at
her
watch
the
telegraph
office
she
said
and
as
quickly
as
may
as
the
runners
panted
over
the
mall
up
and
down
and
on
madeline
said
to
herself
she
shall
have
her
chance
she
shall
the
four
reeking
paharis
pulled
up
at
the
telegraph
office
and
madeline
sped
up
the
steps
there
was
a
table
with
forms
printed
indian
telegraphs
and
the
usual
bottle
of
thickened
ink
and
pair
of
rusty
pens
she
sat
down
to
her
intention
as
if
she
dared
not
let
it
cool
she
wrote
her
message
swiftly
she
had
worded
it
on
the
way
to
innes
dak
bungalow
solon
from
anderson
simla
frederick
prendergast
died
on
january
at
sing

your
letter
considered
confidential
if
you

left
no
will
m
send

urgent
babu
she
said
to
the
clerk
and
repeat
it
to
the
railway
station
kalka
shall
i
fill
up
another
form
no
very
at
the
door
she
turned
and
came
back
it
is
now
eleven
o
clock
she
said
the
person
i
am
telegraphing
to
is
on
her
way
down
to
get
tonight
s
train
at
kalka
i
am
hoping
to
catch
her
at
solon
do
you
think
i
can
i
think
so
madam
oyess
it
is
the
custom
to
stop
at
solon
for
tiffin
the
telegram
can
arrive
there
all
urgent
telegram
going
very
and
in
any
case
said
madeline
it
can
not
fail
to
reach
her
at
kalka
not
possible
to
fail
she
will
have
her
chance
she
said
to
herself
on
her
way
to
the
post
office
to
order
her
tonga
and
with
a
little
nauseated
shudder
at
the
thought
of
the
letter
in
her
pocket
she
added
it
is
amazing
i
should
have
thought
her
too
good
a
woman
of
business
after
which
she
concentrated
her
whole
attention
upon
the
necessities
of
departure
her
single
immediate
apprehension
was
that
horace
innes
might
by
some
magic
of
circumstances
be
transported
back
into
simla
before
she
could
get
out
of
it
that
such
a
contingency
was
physically
impossible
made
no
difference
to
her
nerves
and
to
the
last
brookes
was
the
hurrying
victim
of
unnecessary
promptings
the
little
rambling
hotel
of
kalka
where
the
railway
spreads
out
over
the
plains
raises
its
shelter
under
the
very
walls
of
the
himalayas
madeline
just
arrived
lay
back
in
a
long
wicker
chair
on
the
veranda
and
looked
up
at
them
as
they
mounted
green
and
grey
and
silent
under
the
beating
of
the
first
of
the
rains
everywhere
was
a
luxury
of
silence
the
place
was
steeped
in
it
drowned
in
it
a
feeding
cow
flicked
an
automatic
tail
under
a
tree
near
the
low
mud
wall
that
strolled
irresolutely
between
the
house
and
the
hills
leaned
a
bush
with
a
few
single
pink
roses
their
petals
were
floating
down
under
the
battering
drops
a
draggled
bee
tried
to
climb
to
a
dry
place
on
a
pillar
of
the
veranda
above
all
the
hills
immediate
towering
all
grey
and
green
solidly
ideal
with
phantasies
of
mist
everything
drippingly
soft
and
silent
suddenly
the
venetian
blind
that
hung
before
the
door
of
a
bedroom
farther
on
swayed
out
before
a
hand
variously
ringed
to
emit
a
lady
in
a
pink
lawn
dress
with
apt
embroideries
madeline
s
eyes
opened
very
wide
and
for
an
instant
she
and
the
lady
to
whom
i
must
once
more
refer
as
innes
confronted
each
other
then
innes
s
countenance
expanded
and
she
took
three
or
four
light
steps
forward
oh
you
dear
thing
she
exclaimed
i
thought
you
were
in
simla
imagine
you
being
here
do
you
know
you
have
saved
me
madeline
regarded
her
in
silence
while
a
pallor
spread
over
her
face
and
lips
and
her
features
grew
sharp
with
a
presage
of
pain
have
i
she
stammered
she
could
not
think
indeed
you
have
i
don
t
know
how
to
be
grateful
enough
to
you
your
telegram
of
yesterday
reached
me
at
solon
we
had
just
sat
down
to
tiffin
nothing
will
ever
shake
my
faith
in
providence
again
my
dear
think
of
it
after
all
i
ve
been
through
my
darling
val
and
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
well
well
i
stayed
behind
there
last
night
and
val
came
on
here
and
made
the
necessary
arrangement
and
yes
and
we
were
married
this
morning
good
heavens
what
s
the
matter
with
you
here
oh
brookes
water
salts
anything
brookes
i
know
would
think
that
i
should
dwell
at
greater
length
upon
miss
anderson
s
attack
of
faintness
in
kalka
and
the
various
measures
which
were
resorted
to
for
her
succour
but
perhaps
the
feelings
and
expedients
of
any
really
capable
lady
under
the
circumstances
may
be
taken
for
granted
i
feel
more
seriously
called
upon
to
explain
that
colonel
horace
innes
shortly
after
these
last
events
took
two
years
furlough
to
england
during
which
he
made
a
very
interesting
tour
in
the
united
states
with
the
lady
with
now
bears
his
name
by
inalienable
right
captain
and
valentine
drake
are
getting
the
most
that
is
to
be
had
out
of
frederick
prendergast
s
fortune
with
courage
in
london
and
the
european
capitals
where
drake
is
sometimes
mentioned
as
a
lady
with
a
romantic
past
they
have
not
returned
to
simla
where
the
situation
has
never
been
properly
understood
people
always
supposed
that
drake
ran
away
that
june
morning
with
her
present
husband
who
must
have
been
tremendously
fond
of
her
to
have
married
her
after
the
she
is
also
occasionally
mentioned
in
undertones
as
the
first
all
of
which
we
know
to
be
quite
erroneous
like
most
scandal
mickie
and
gammidge
in
retirement
are
superintending
the
education
of
their
children
in
bedford
where
it
is
cheap
and
practical
they
converse
when
they
meet
about
the
iniquitous
prices
of
dressmakers
and
the
degeneracy
of
the
kind
of
cook
obtainable
in
england
at
eighteen
pounds
a
year
gammidge
has
grown
rather
portly
and
very
ritualistic
they
seldom
speak
of
simla
and
when
they
do
if
too
reminiscent
a
spark
appears
in
mickie
s
eye
gammidge
changes
the
subject
kitty
vesey
still
fills
her
dance
cards
at
viceregal
functions
though
people
do
not
quote
her
as
they
used
to
and
subalterns
imagine
themselves
vastly
witty
about
her
colour
which
is
unimpaired
people
often
commend
her
however
for
her
good
nature
to
debutantes
and
it
is
admitted
that
she
may
still
ride
with
credit
in
affinity
stakes
and
occasionally
win
them
the
pool
in
the
desert
i
knew
anna
chichele
and
judy
harbottle
so
well
and
they
figured
so
vividly
at
one
time
against
the
rather
empty
landscape
of
life
in
a
frontier
station
that
my
affection
for
one
of
them
used
to
seem
little
more
or
less
than
a
variant
upon
my
affection
for
the
other
that
recollection
however
bears
examination
badly
judy
was
much
the
better
sort
and
it
is
judy
s
part
in
it
that
draws
me
into
telling
the
story
conveying
judy
is
what
i
tremble
at
her
part
was
simple
looking
back
and
not
so
very
far
her
part
has
the
relief
of
high
comedy
with
the
proximity
of
tears
but
looking
closely
i
find
that
it
is
mostly
judy
and
what
she
did
is
entirely
second
in
my
untarnished
picture
to
what
she
was
still
i
do
not
think
i
can
dissuade
myself
from
putting
it
down
they
would
of
course
inevitably
have
found
each
other
sooner
or
later
harbottle
and
chichele
but
it
was
i
who
actually
introduced
them
my
palmy
veranda
in
rawul
pindi
where
the
teacups
used
to
assemble
was
the
scene
of
it
i
presided
behind
my
samovar
over
the
early
formalities
that
were
almost
at
once
to
drop
from
their
friendship
like
the
sheath
of
some
bursting
flower
i
deliberately
brought
them
together
so
the
birth
was
not
accidental
and
my
interest
in
it
quite
legitimately
maternal
we
always
had
tea
in
the
veranda
in
rawul
pindi
the
was
painted
blue
blue
for
thirty
feet
up
to
the
whitewashed
cotton
ceiling
nothing
of
any
value
in
the
way
of
a
human
relation
i
am
sure
could
have
originated
there
the
veranda
was
spacious
and
open
their
mutual
observation
had
room
and
freedom
i
watched
it
to
and
fro
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
my
reward
the
beautiful
candour
i
expected
between
them
was
not
ten
minutes
in
coming
for
the
sake
of
it
i
had
taken
some
trouble
but
when
i
perceived
it
revealing
i
went
and
sat
down
beside
judy
s
husband
robert
harbottle
and
talked
about
pharaoh
s
split
hoof
it
was
only
fair
and
when
next
day
i
got
their
impressions
of
one
another
i
felt
and
deserving
i
knew
it
would
be
a
satisfactory
sort
of
thing
to
do
but
perhaps
it
was
rather
more
for
judy
s
sake
than
for
anna
s
that
i
did
it
harbottle
was
only
then
and
robert
a
major
but
he
had
brought
her
to
india
out
of
an
episode
too
to
tone
with
english
hedges
their
marriage
had
come
in
short
of
his
divorce
and
as
too
natural
a
consequence
in
india
it
is
well
known
that
the
eye
becomes
accustomed
to
primitive
pigments
and
high
lights
the
aesthetic
consideration
if
nothing
else
demanded
robert
s
exchange
he
was
lucky
to
get
a
piffer
regiment
and
the
twelfth
were
lucky
to
get
him
we
were
all
lucky
i
thought
to
get
judy
it
was
an
opinion
of
course
a
good
deal
challenged
even
in
rawul
pindi
where
it
was
thought
especially
in
the
beginning
that
acquiescence
was
the
most
the
harbottles
could
hope
for
that
is
not
enough
in
india
cordiality
is
the
common
right
i
could
not
have
judy
preserving
her
atmosphere
at
our
and
gymkhanas
not
that
there
were
two
minds
among
us
about
the
case
it
was
a
preposterous
case
sentimentally
undignified
from
some
points
of
view
deplorable
i
chose
to
reserve
my
point
of
view
from
which
i
saw
it
on
judy
s
behalf
merely
quixotic
preferring
on
robert
s
just
to
close
my
eyes
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
first
wife
was
odious
to
a
degree
which
it
is
simply
pleasanter
not
to
recount
but
her
malignity
must
almost
have
amounted
to
a
sense
of
humour
her
detestation
of
her
cousin
judy
thynne
dated
much
further
back
than
robert
s
attachment
that
began
in
paris
where
judy
a
young
widow
was
developing
a
real
vein
at
julian
s
i
am
entirely
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
as
people
say
in
it
judy
had
not
a
thought
at
that
time
that
was
not
based
on
chinese
white
and
permeated
with
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
it
and
no
doubt
the
turgid
imagination
of
the
first
harbottle
dealt
with
it
honestly
enough
at
all
events
she
saw
her
opportunity
and
the
depths
of
her
indifference
to
robert
bubbled
up
venomously
into
the
suit
that
it
was
undefended
was
the
senseless
mystery
decency
ordained
that
he
and
judy
should
have
made
a
fight
even
in
the
hope
that
it
would
be
a
losing
one
the
reason
it
had
to
be
a
losing
one
the
reason
so
immensely
criticized
was
that
the
petitioning
lady
obstinately
refused
to
bring
her
action
against
any
other
set
of
circumstances
than
those
to
which
i
have
no
doubt
judy
contributed
every
indiscretion
it
is
hard
to
imagine
robert
harbottle
refusing
her
any
sort
of
justification
that
the
law
demands
short
of
beating
her
but
her
malice
would
accept
nothing
of
which
the
account
did
not
go
for
final
settlement
to
judy
thynne
if
her
husband
wanted
his
liberty
he
should
have
it
she
declared
at
that
price
and
no
other
major
harbottle
did
indeed
deeply
long
for
his
liberty
and
his
interesting
friend
thynne
had
one
can
only
say
the
most
vivid
commiseration
for
his
bondage
whatever
chance
they
had
of
winning
to
win
would
be
for
the
end
they
had
at
heart
to
lose
so
they
simply
abstained
as
it
were
from
comment
upon
the
detestable
procedure
which
terminated
in
the
rule
absolute
i
have
often
wondered
whether
the
whole
business
would
not
have
been
more
defensible
if
there
had
been
on
judy
s
part
any
emotional
spring
for
the
leap
they
made
i
offer
my
conviction
that
there
was
none
that
she
was
only
extravagantly
affected
by
the
ideals
of
the
quarter
it
is
a
transporting
atmosphere
and
held
a
view
of
comradeship
which
permitted
the
reversal
of
the
modern
situation
filled
by
a
blameless
correspondent
robert
of
course
was
tremendously
in
love
with
her
but
my
theory
is
that
she
married
him
as
the
logical
outcome
of
her
sacrifice
and
by
no
means
the
smallest
part
of
it
it
was
all
quite
unimaginable
as
so
many
things
are
but
the
upshot
of
it
brought
judy
to
rawul
pindi
as
i
have
said
where
i
for
one
thought
her
mistake
insignificant
compared
with
her
value
it
would
have
been
great
her
value
anywhere
in
the
middle
of
the
punjab
it
was
incalculable
to
explain
why
would
be
to
explain
british
india
but
i
hope
it
will
appear
and
i
am
quite
willing
remember
to
take
the
responsibility
if
it
does
not
somers
chichele
anna
s
son
it
is
absurd
to
think
must
have
been
about
fifteen
then
reflecting
at
winchester
with
the
other
men
upon
the
comparative
merits
of
tinned
sardines
and
jam
roll
and
whether
a
packet
of
real
egyptians
was
not
worth
the
sacrifice
of
either
his
father
was
colonel
of
the
twelfth
his
mother
was
still
charming
it
was
the
year
before
dick
forsyth
came
down
from
the
neighbourhood
of
sheikhbudin
with
a
brevet
and
a
good
deal
of
personal
damage
i
mention
him
because
he
proved
anna
s
charm
in
the
only
conclusive
way
before
the
eyes
of
us
all
and
the
station
i
remember
was
edified
to
observe
that
if
chichele
came
out
of
the
matter
straight
one
relapses
so
easily
into
the
simple
definitions
of
those
parts
which
she
undoubtedly
did
she
owed
it
in
no
small
degree
to
judy
harbottle
this
one
feels
to
be
hardly
a
legitimate
reference
but
it
is
something
tangible
to
lay
hold
upon
in
trying
to
describe
the
web
of
volitions
which
began
to
weave
itself
between
the
two
that
afternoon
on
my
veranda
and
which
afterward
became
so
strong
a
bond
i
was
delighted
with
the
thing
its
simplicity
and
sincerity
stood
out
among
our
conventional
little
compromises
at
friendship
like
an
ideal
she
and
judy
had
the
assurance
of
one
another
they
made
upon
one
another
the
finest
and
often
the
most
unconscionable
demands
one
met
them
walking
at
odd
hours
in
queer
places
of
which
i
imagine
they
were
not
much
aware
they
would
turn
deliberately
off
the
maidan
and
away
from
the
bandstand
to
be
rid
of
our
irrelevant
bows
they
did
their
duty
by
the
rest
of
us
but
the
most
egregious
among
us
the
for
selection
could
see
that
he
hardly
counted
i
thought
i
understood
but
that
may
have
been
my
fatuity
certainly
when
their
husbands
inquired
what
on
earth
they
had
been
talking
of
it
usually
transpired
that
they
had
found
an
infinite
amount
to
say
about
nothing
it
was
a
little
worrying
to
hear
colonel
chichele
and
major
harbottle
describe
their
wives
as
pals
but
the
fact
could
not
be
denied
and
after
all
we
were
in
the
punjab
they
were
pals
too
but
the
terms
were
different
people
discussed
it
according
to
their
lights
and
girls
said
in
pretty
wonderment
that
harbottle
and
chichele
were
like
men
they
never
kissed
each
other
i
think
judy
prescribed
these
conditions
anna
was
far
more
a
person
who
did
as
the
world
told
her
but
it
was
a
poor
negation
to
describe
all
that
they
never
did
there
was
no
common
little
convention
of
attachment
that
did
not
seem
to
be
tacitly
omitted
between
them
i
hope
one
did
not
too
cynically
observe
that
they
offered
these
to
their
husbands
instead
the
redeeming
observation
was
their
husbands
complete
satisfaction
this
they
maintained
to
the
end
in
the
natural
order
of
things
robert
harbottle
should
have
paid
heavily
for
interfering
as
he
did
in
paris
between
a
woman
and
what
she
was
entitled
to
live
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
paid
anything
at
all
i
doubt
whether
he
ever
knew
himself
a
debtor
judy
kept
her
temperament
under
like
a
current
and
swam
with
the
tides
of
the
surface
taking
refreshing
dips
only
now
and
then
which
one
traced
in
her
eyes
and
her
hair
when
she
and
robert
came
back
from
leave
that
sort
of
thing
is
lost
in
the
sands
of
india
but
it
makes
an
oasis
as
it
travels
and
it
sometimes
seemed
to
me
a
curious
pity
that
she
and
anna
should
sit
in
the
shade
of
it
together
while
robert
and
peter
chichele
their
titular
companions
blundered
on
in
the
desert
but
after
all
if
you
are
born
blind
and
the
men
were
both
immensely
liked
and
the
shooting
was
good
ten
years
later
somers
joined
the
twelfth
were
at
peshawur
robert
harbottle
was
by
that
time
and
had
the
regiment
distinction
had
incrusted
in
the
indian
way
upon
peter
chichele
its
former
colonel
he
was
general
commanding
the
district
and
so
we
were
all
still
together
in
peshawur
it
was
great
luck
for
the
chicheles
sir
peter
s
having
the
district
though
his
father
s
old
regiment
would
have
made
it
pleasant
enough
for
the
boy
in
any
case
he
came
to
us
i
mean
of
course
to
two
or
three
of
us
with
the
interest
that
hangs
about
a
victim
of
circumstances
we
understood
that
he
wasn
t
a
born
anna
had
told
me
on
the
contrary
that
he
was
a
sacrifice
to
family
tradition
made
inevitable
by
the
general
s
unfortunate
investments
bellona
s
bridegroom
was
not
a
role
he
fancied
though
he
would
make
a
kind
of
compromise
as
best
man
he
would
agree
she
said
to
be
a
war
correspondent
and
write
picturesque
specials
for
the
london
halfpenny
press
there
was
the
humour
of
the
poor
boy
s
despair
in
it
but
she
conveyed
it
i
remember
in
exactly
the
same
tone
with
which
she
had
said
to
me
years
before
that
he
wanted
to
drive
a
she
carried
quite
her
half
of
the
family
tradition
though
she
could
talk
of
sacrifice
and
make
her
eyes
wistful
contemplating
for
somers
the
limitations
of
the
and
the
camp
of
exercise
proclaiming
and
insisting
upon
what
she
would
have
done
if
she
could
only
have
chosen
for
him
anna
chichele
saw
things
that
way
with
more
than
a
passable
sense
of
all
that
was
involved
if
she
could
have
made
her
son
an
artist
in
life
or
a
if
she
could
have
given
him
the
seeing
eye
or
order
of
the
star
of
india
she
would
not
have
hesitated
for
an
instant
judy
with
her
single
mind
cried
out
almost
at
sight
of
him
upon
them
both
i
mean
both
anna
and
sir
peter
not
that
the
boy
carried
his
condemnation
badly
or
even
obviously
i
venture
that
no
one
noticed
it
in
the
mess
but
it
was
naturally
plain
to
those
of
us
who
were
under
the
same
he
had
put
in
his
two
years
with
a
british
regiment
at
meerut
they
nurse
subalterns
that
way
for
the
indian
army
and
his
eyes
no
longer
played
with
the
tinsel
vision
of
india
they
looked
instead
into
the
arid
stretch
beyond
this
preoccupation
conveyed
to
the
s
wife
the
suggestion
that
chichele
was
the
victim
of
a
hopeless
attachment
harbottle
made
no
such
mistake
she
saw
simply
i
imagine
the
beginnings
of
her
own
hunger
and
thirst
in
him
looking
back
as
she
told
us
across
a
decade
of
dusty
sunsets
to
remember
them
the
decade
was
there
close
to
the
memory
of
all
of
us
we
put
from
judy
herself
downward
an
absurd
amount
of
confidence
in
it
she
looked
so
well
the
night
she
met
him
it
was
english
mail
day
she
depended
a
great
deal
upon
her
letters
and
i
suppose
somebody
had
written
her
a
word
that
brought
her
that
happy
still
excitement
that
is
the
inner
mystery
of
words
he
went
straight
to
her
with
some
speech
about
his
mother
having
given
him
leave
and
for
twenty
minutes
she
patronized
him
on
a
sofa
as
his
mother
would
not
have
dreamed
of
doing
anna
chichele
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
smiled
on
the
pair
i
depend
on
you
and
judy
to
be
good
to
him
while
we
are
away
she
said
she
and
sir
peter
were
going
on
leave
at
the
end
of
the
week
to
scotland
as
usual
for
the
shooting
following
her
glance
i
felt
incapable
of
the
proportion
she
assigned
me
i
will
see
after
his
socks
with
pleasure
i
said
i
think
don
t
you
we
may
leave
the
rest
to
judy
her
eyes
remained
upon
the
boy
and
i
saw
the
passion
rise
in
them
at
which
i
turned
mine
elsewhere
who
can
look
unperturbed
upon
such
a
privacy
of
nature
as
that
poor
old
judy
she
went
on
she
never
would
be
bothered
with
him
in
all
his
dear
time
she
resented
his
claims
the
unreasonable
creature
used
to
limit
me
to
three
anecdotes
a
week
and
now
she
has
him
on
her
hands
if
you
like
see
the
pretty
air
of
deference
in
the
way
he
listens
to
her
he
has
nice
manners
the
villain
if
he
is
a
chichele
oh
you
have
improved
sir
peter
s
i
said
kindly
i
do
hope
judy
will
think
him
worth
while
i
can
t
quite
expect
that
he
will
be
up
to
her
bless
him
she
is
so
much
cleverer
isn
t
she
than
any
of
us
but
if
she
will
just
be
herself
with
him
it
will
make
such
a
the
other
two
crossed
the
room
to
us
at
that
and
judy
gaily
made
somers
over
to
his
mother
trailing
off
to
find
robert
in
the
well
what
has
harbottle
been
telling
you
anna
asked
him
the
young
man
s
eye
followed
judy
his
hand
went
musingly
to
his
moustache
she
was
telling
me
he
said
that
people
in
india
were
sepulchers
of
themselves
but
that
now
and
then
one
came
who
could
roll
away
another
s
it
sounds
promising
said
lady
chichele
to
me
it
sounds
cryptic
i
laughed
to
somers
but
i
saw
that
he
had
the
key
i
can
not
say
that
i
attended
diligently
to
chichele
s
socks
but
the
part
corresponding
was
freely
assigned
me
after
his
people
went
i
saw
him
often
he
pretended
to
find
qualities
in
my
tea
implied
that
he
found
them
in
my
talk
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
my
inquiring
attitude
that
he
loved
the
knowledge
that
there
was
no
detail
that
he
could
give
me
about
himself
his
impressions
and
experiences
that
was
unlikely
to
interest
me
i
would
not
for
the
world
imply
that
he
was
egotistical
or
complacent
absolutely
the
reverse
but
he
possessed
an
articulate
soul
which
found
its
happiness
in
expression
and
i
liked
to
listen
i
feel
that
these
are
complicated
words
to
explain
a
very
simple
relation
and
i
pause
to
wonder
what
is
left
to
me
if
i
wished
to
describe
his
commerce
with
harbottle
luckily
there
is
an
alternative
one
needn
t
do
it
i
wish
i
had
somewhere
on
paper
judy
s
own
account
of
it
at
this
period
however
it
is
a
thing
she
would
have
enjoyed
writing
and
more
enjoyed
communicating
at
this
period
there
was
a
grave
reticence
in
his
talk
about
her
which
amused
me
in
the
beginning
harbottle
had
been
for
ten
years
important
enough
to
us
all
but
her
serious
significance
the
light
and
the
beauty
in
her
had
plainly
been
reserved
for
the
discovery
of
this
sensitive
and
intelligent
person
not
very
long
from
sandhurst
and
exactly
i
was
barely
allowed
a
familiar
reference
and
anything
approaching
a
flippancy
was
met
with
penetrating
silence
i
was
almost
rebuked
for
lightly
suggesting
that
she
must
occasionally
find
herself
bored
in
peshawur
i
think
not
anywhere
said
chichele
mrs
harbottle
is
one
of
the
few
people
who
sound
the
privilege
of
this
to
me
who
had
counted
harbottle
s
yawns
on
so
many
occasions
it
became
presently
necessary
to
be
careful
tactful
in
one
s
implications
about
harbottle
and
to
recognize
a
certain
distinction
in
the
fact
that
one
was
the
only
person
with
whom
chichele
discussed
her
at
all
the
day
came
when
we
talked
of
robert
it
was
bound
to
come
in
the
progress
of
any
understanding
and
affectionate
colloquy
which
had
his
wife
for
inspiration
i
was
familiar
of
course
with
somers
s
opinion
that
the
colonel
was
an
awfully
good
sort
that
had
been
among
the
preliminaries
and
become
understood
as
the
base
of
all
references
and
i
liked
robert
harbottle
very
well
myself
when
his
adjutant
called
him
a
born
leader
of
men
however
i
felt
compelled
to
look
at
the
statement
consideringly
in
a
tight
place
i
said
dear
me
what
expressions
had
the
freedom
of
our
little
frontier
i
would
as
soon
depend
on
him
as
on
anybody
but
as
for
leadership
he
is
such
a
good
fellow
that
nobody
here
does
justice
to
his
soldierly
qualities
said
chichele
except
has
she
been
telling
you
about
them
i
inquired
well
he
hesitated
she
told
me
about
the
mulla
nulla
affair
she
is
rather
proud
of
that
any
woman
would
poor
dear
judy
i
mused
somers
said
nothing
but
looked
at
me
removing
his
cigarette
as
if
my
words
would
be
the
better
of
explanation
she
has
taken
refuge
in
them
in
bob
harbottle
s
soldierly
qualities
ever
since
she
married
him
i
continued
taken
refuge
he
repeated
coldly
but
at
my
uncompromising
glance
his
eyes
fell
well
i
said
you
mean
oh
i
mean
what
i
say
i
laughed
your
cigarette
has
gone
out
have
i
think
her
devotion
to
him
quite
splendid
have
you
seen
the
things
he
brought
her
from
the
simla
art
exhibition
he
said
they
were
nice
bits
of
colour
and
she
has
hung
them
in
the
where
she
will
have
to
look
at
them
every
day
let
us
admire
her
dear
oh
he
said
with
a
fine
air
of
detachment
do
you
think
they
are
so
necessary
those
agreements
well
i
replied
we
see
that
they
are
not
indispensable
more
sugar
i
have
only
given
you
one
lump
and
we
know
at
all
events
i
added
unguardedly
that
she
could
never
have
had
an
illusion
about
the
young
man
looked
up
quickly
is
that
story
true
he
asked
there
was
a
story
but
most
of
us
have
forgotten
it
who
told
you
the
the
i
said
has
an
accurate
memory
and
a
sense
of
proportion
as
i
suppose
you
were
bound
to
get
it
from
somebody
i
am
glad
you
got
it
from
i
was
not
prepared
to
go
on
and
saw
with
some
relief
that
somers
was
not
either
his
silence
as
he
smoked
seemed
to
me
deliberate
and
i
had
oddly
enough
at
this
moment
for
the
first
time
the
impression
that
he
was
a
man
and
not
a
boy
then
the
harbottles
themselves
joined
us
very
cheery
after
a
gallop
from
the
we
talked
of
old
times
old
friendships
good
swords
that
were
broken
names
that
had
carried
far
and
somers
effaced
himself
in
the
perfect
manner
of
the
british
subaltern
it
was
a
long
pleasant
gossip
and
i
thought
judy
seemed
rather
glad
to
let
her
husband
dictate
its
level
which
of
course
he
did
i
noticed
when
the
three
rode
away
together
that
the
colonel
was
beginning
to
sit
down
rather
solidly
on
his
big
new
zealander
and
i
watched
the
dusk
come
over
from
the
foothills
for
a
long
time
thinking
more
kindly
than
i
had
spoken
of
robert
harbottle
i
have
often
wondered
how
far
happiness
is
contributed
to
a
temperament
like
judy
harbottle
s
and
how
far
it
creates
its
own
but
i
doubt
whether
on
either
count
she
found
as
much
in
any
other
winter
of
her
life
except
perhaps
the
remote
ones
by
the
seine
those
ardent
hours
of
hers
when
everything
she
said
was
touched
with
the
flame
of
her
individuality
came
oftener
she
suddenly
cleaned
up
her
palate
and
began
to
translate
in
one
study
after
another
the
language
of
the
frontier
country
that
spoke
only
in
stones
and
in
shadows
under
the
stones
and
in
sunlight
over
them
there
is
nothing
in
the
academy
of
this
year
at
all
events
that
i
would
exchange
for
the
one
she
gave
me
she
lived
her
physical
life
at
a
pace
which
carried
us
all
along
with
her
she
hunted
and
drove
and
danced
and
dined
with
such
sincere
intention
as
convinced
us
all
that
in
hunting
and
driving
and
dancing
and
dining
there
were
satisfactions
that
had
been
somehow
overlooked
the
s
wife
said
it
was
delightful
to
meet
harbottle
she
seemed
to
enjoy
everything
so
thoroughly
the
looked
at
her
critically
and
asked
her
if
she
were
quite
sure
she
hadn
t
a
night
temperature
he
was
a
scotchman
one
night
colonel
harbottle
hearing
her
give
away
the
last
extra
charged
her
with
renewing
her
youth
no
bob
she
said
only
imitating
ah
that
question
of
her
youth
it
was
so
near
her
still
she
told
me
once
she
heard
the
beat
of
its
flying
and
the
pulse
in
her
veins
answered
the
false
signal
that
was
afterward
when
she
told
the
truth
she
was
not
so
happy
when
she
indulged
herself
otherwise
as
when
she
asked
one
to
remember
that
she
was
a
woman
with
thoughts
and
satisfactions
i
am
now
really
happiest
she
declared
when
the
commissioner
takes
me
in
to
dinner
when
the
general
commanding
leads
me
to
the
she
did
her
best
to
make
it
an
honest
conviction
i
offered
her
a
recent
success
not
crowned
by
the
academy
and
she
put
it
down
on
the
table
by
and
by
she
said
at
present
i
am
reading
pascal
and
well
she
was
reading
pascal
and
bossuet
she
grieved
aloud
that
most
of
our
activities
in
india
were
so
indomitably
youthful
owing
to
the
accident
that
most
of
us
were
always
so
young
there
is
no
dignified
distraction
in
this
country
she
complained
for
respectable
ladies
nearing
she
seemed
to
like
to
make
these
declarations
in
the
presence
of
somers
chichele
who
would
look
at
her
with
a
little
queer
smile
a
bad
translation
i
imagine
of
what
he
felt
she
gave
herself
so
generously
to
her
seniors
that
somebody
said
harbottle
s
girdle
was
hung
with
brass
hats
it
seems
flippant
to
add
that
her
complexion
was
as
honest
as
the
day
but
the
fact
is
that
the
year
before
judy
had
felt
compelled
like
the
rest
of
us
to
repair
just
a
little
the
ravages
of
the
climate
if
she
had
never
done
it
one
would
not
have
looked
twice
at
the
absurdity
when
she
said
of
the
in
the
i
have
raised
that
thing
to
the
level
of
an
immorality
and
sailed
in
to
dance
with
an
uncompromising
expression
and
a
face
uncompromised
i
have
not
spoken
of
her
beauty
for
one
thing
it
was
not
always
there
and
there
were
people
who
would
deny
it
altogether
or
whose
considered
comment
was
i
wouldn
t
call
her
they
of
course
were
people
in
whom
she
declined
to
be
interested
but
even
for
those
of
us
who
could
evoke
some
demonstration
of
her
vivid
self
her
face
would
not
always
light
in
correspondence
when
it
did
there
was
none
that
i
liked
better
to
look
at
and
i
envied
somers
chichele
his
way
to
make
it
the
pale
shining
thing
that
would
hold
him
lifted
in
return
for
hours
together
with
i
know
not
what
mystic
power
of
a
moon
upon
the
tide
and
he
oh
he
was
dark
and
delicate
by
nature
simple
sincere
delightfully
intelligent
his
common
title
to
charm
was
the
rather
sweet
seriousness
that
rested
on
his
upper
lip
and
a
certain
winning
gratification
in
his
attention
but
he
had
a
subtler
one
in
his
eyes
which
must
be
always
seeking
and
smiling
over
what
they
found
those
eyes
of
perpetual
inquiry
for
the
exquisite
which
ask
so
little
help
to
create
it
a
personality
to
button
up
in
a
uniform
good
heavens
as
i
begin
to
think
of
them
together
i
remember
how
the
maternal
note
appeared
in
her
talk
about
him
his
youth
is
pathetic
she
told
me
but
there
is
nothing
that
he
does
not
don
t
apologize
judy
i
said
we
were
so
brusque
on
the
frontier
besides
the
matter
still
suffered
a
jocular
presentment
harbottle
and
chichele
were
still
great
friends
we
could
still
put
them
next
each
other
at
our
without
the
feeling
that
it
would
be
there
was
still
nothing
unusual
in
the
fact
that
when
harbottle
was
there
chichele
might
be
taken
for
granted
we
were
so
also
on
the
frontier
it
grew
more
obvious
the
maternal
note
i
began
positively
to
dread
it
almost
as
much
i
imagine
as
somers
did
she
took
her
privileges
all
in
anna
s
name
she
exercised
her
authority
quite
as
lady
chichele
s
proxy
she
went
to
the
very
limit
anna
chichele
she
said
actually
in
his
presence
is
a
fortunate
woman
she
has
all
kinds
of
cleverness
and
she
has
her
tall
son
i
have
only
one
little
talent
and
i
have
no
tall
now
it
was
not
in
nature
that
she
could
have
had
a
son
as
tall
as
somers
nor
was
that
desire
in
her
eyes
all
civilization
implies
a
good
deal
of
farce
but
this
was
a
poor
refuge
a
cheap
device
i
was
glad
when
it
fell
away
from
her
sincerity
when
the
day
came
on
which
she
looked
into
my
fire
and
said
simply
an
attachment
like
ours
has
no
i
wonder
i
said
for
what
comes
and
goes
she
went
on
dreamily
how
could
there
be
a
formula
look
here
judy
i
said
you
know
me
very
well
what
if
the
flesh
leaps
with
the
spirit
she
looked
at
me
very
white
oh
no
she
said
i
waited
but
there
seemed
nothing
more
that
she
could
say
and
in
the
silence
the
futile
negative
seemed
to
wander
round
the
room
repeating
itself
like
an
echo
oh
no
i
poked
the
fire
presently
to
drown
the
sound
of
it
judy
sat
still
with
her
feet
crossed
and
her
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
her
coat
staring
into
the
coals
can
you
live
independently
satisfied
with
your
interests
and
occupations
she
demanded
at
last
yes
i
know
you
can
i
can
t
i
must
exist
more
than
half
in
other
people
it
is
what
they
think
and
feel
that
matters
to
me
just
as
much
as
what
i
think
and
feel
the
best
of
life
is
in
that
it
has
always
been
a
passion
with
you
judy
i
replied
i
can
imagine
how
much
you
must
miss
whom
anna
chichele
i
said
softly
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
fixing
here
and
there
an
intent
regard
upon
things
which
she
did
not
see
oh
i
do
she
said
at
one
point
with
the
effect
of
pulling
herself
together
she
took
another
turn
or
two
and
then
finding
herself
near
the
door
she
went
out
i
felt
as
profoundly
humiliated
for
her
as
if
she
had
staggered
the
next
night
was
one
of
those
that
stand
out
so
vividly
for
no
reason
that
one
can
identify
in
one
s
memory
we
were
dining
with
the
harbottles
a
small
party
for
a
tourist
they
had
with
them
judy
and
i
and
somers
and
the
traveller
had
drifted
out
into
the
veranda
where
the
scent
of
japanese
lilies
came
and
went
on
the
spring
wind
to
trouble
the
souls
of
any
taken
unawares
there
was
a
brightness
beyond
the
foothills
where
the
moon
was
coming
and
i
remember
how
one
tall
clump
swayed
out
against
it
and
seemed
in
passionate
perfume
to
lay
a
burden
on
the
breast
judy
moved
away
from
it
and
sat
clasping
her
knees
on
the
edge
of
the
veranda
somers
when
his
eyes
were
not
upon
her
looked
always
at
the
lily
even
the
spirit
of
the
was
stirred
and
he
said
i
think
you
live
in
a
kind
of
little
there
was
an
instant
s
silence
and
then
judy
turned
her
face
into
the
lamplight
from
the
with
everything
but
the
essentials
she
said
we
stayed
late
chichele
and
ourselves
were
the
last
to
go
judy
walked
with
us
along
the
moonlit
drive
to
the
gate
which
is
so
unnecessary
a
luxury
in
india
that
the
servants
always
leave
it
open
she
swung
the
stiff
halves
together
now
she
said
it
is
and
i
said
somers
chichele
softly
and
quickly
am
on
the
other
even
over
that
depth
she
could
flash
him
a
smile
it
is
the
business
of
my
life
she
gave
him
in
return
to
keep
this
gate
i
felt
as
if
they
had
forgotten
us
somers
mounted
and
rode
off
without
a
word
we
were
walking
in
a
different
direction
looking
back
i
saw
judy
leaning
immovable
on
the
gate
while
somers
turned
in
his
saddle
apparently
to
repeat
the
form
of
lifting
his
hat
and
all
about
them
stretched
the
stones
of
kabul
valley
vague
and
formless
in
the
tide
of
the
moonlight
next
day
a
note
from
harbottle
informed
me
that
she
had
gone
to
bombay
for
a
fortnight
in
a
postscript
she
wrote
i
shall
wait
for
the
chicheles
there
and
come
back
with
i
remember
reflecting
that
if
she
could
not
induce
herself
to
take
a
passage
to
england
in
the
ship
that
brought
them
it
seemed
the
right
thing
to
do
she
did
come
back
with
them
i
met
the
party
at
the
station
i
knew
somers
would
meet
them
and
it
seemed
to
me
so
imminent
did
disaster
loom
that
someone
else
should
be
there
someone
to
offer
a
covering
movement
or
a
flank
support
wherever
it
might
be
most
needed
and
among
all
our
smiling
faces
disaster
did
come
or
the
cold
premonition
of
it
we
were
all
perfect
but
somers
s
lip
trembled
deprived
for
a
fortnight
he
was
eager
for
the
draft
and
he
was
only
his
lip
trembled
and
there
under
the
flickering
suddenly
stood
that
of
which
there
never
could
be
again
any
denial
for
those
of
us
who
saw
did
we
make
i
wonder
even
a
pretense
of
disguising
the
consternation
that
sprang
up
among
us
like
an
armed
thing
ready
to
kill
any
further
suggestion
of
the
truth
i
don
t
know
anna
chichele
s
unfinished
sentence
dropped
as
if
someone
had
given
her
a
blow
upon
the
mouth
coolies
were
piling
the
luggage
into
a
hired
carriage
at
the
edge
of
the
platform
she
walked
mechanically
after
them
and
would
have
stepped
in
with
it
but
for
the
sight
of
her
own
gleaming
landau
drawn
up
within
a
yard
or
two
and
the
general
waiting
we
all
got
home
somehow
taking
it
with
us
and
i
gave
lady
chichele
hours
to
come
to
me
with
her
face
all
one
question
and
her
heart
all
one
fear
she
came
in
twelve
have
you
seen
it
long
prepared
as
i
was
her
directness
was
demoralizing
it
isn
t
a
mortal
oh
for
heaven
s
sake
well
not
with
certainty
for
more
than
a
she
made
a
little
spasmodic
movement
with
her
hands
then
dropped
them
pitifully
couldn
t
you
do
anything
i
looked
at
her
and
she
said
at
once
no
of
course
you
couldn
for
a
moment
or
two
i
took
my
share
of
the
heavy
sense
of
it
my
trivial
share
which
yet
was
an
experience
sufficiently
exciting
i
am
afraid
it
will
have
to
be
faced
i
said
what
will
happen
anna
cried
oh
what
will
happen
why
not
the
usual
thing
lady
chichele
looked
up
quickly
as
if
at
a
reminder
the
ambiguous
attachment
of
the
country
i
went
on
limping
but
courageous
half
declared
half
admitted
that
leads
vaguely
nowhere
and
finally
perishes
as
the
man
s
life
enriches
itself
the
thing
we
have
seen
so
whatever
judy
is
capable
of
it
won
t
be
the
usual
thing
you
know
i
had
to
confess
in
silence
that
i
did
it
flashed
at
me
the
difference
in
her
in
she
pressed
her
lips
together
and
then
went
on
unsteadily
in
her
eyes
her
voice
she
was
mannered
extravagant
elaborate
with
me
all
the
way
up
i
wondered
and
worried
but
i
never
thought
she
stopped
her
voice
simply
shook
itself
into
silence
i
called
a
servant
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
good
stiff
peg
i
said
i
apologize
for
the
peg
but
not
for
the
whisky
and
soda
it
is
a
beverage
on
the
frontier
of
which
the
vulgarity
is
lost
in
the
value
while
it
was
coming
i
tried
to
talk
of
other
things
but
she
would
only
nod
absently
in
the
pauses
last
night
we
dined
with
him
it
was
guest
night
at
the
mess
and
she
was
there
i
watched
her
and
she
knew
it
i
don
t
know
whether
she
tried
but
anyway
she
failed
the
covenant
between
them
was
written
on
her
forehead
whenever
she
looked
at
him
though
that
was
seldom
she
dared
not
look
at
him
and
the
little
conversation
that
they
had
you
would
have
laughed
it
was
a
comedy
of
stutters
the
facile
harbottle
you
do
well
to
be
angry
naturally
i
said
but
it
would
be
fatal
to
let
yourself
go
angry
oh
i
am
sick
the
misery
of
it
the
terror
of
it
if
it
were
anybody
but
judy
can
t
you
imagine
the
passion
of
a
temperament
like
that
in
a
woman
who
has
all
these
years
been
feeding
on
herself
i
tell
you
she
will
take
him
from
my
very
arms
and
he
will
go
to
i
dare
not
imagine
what
catastrophe
who
can
prevent
it
who
can
prevent
it
there
is
you
i
said
lady
chichele
laughed
hysterically
i
think
you
ought
to
say
there
are
i
what
can
i
do
do
you
realize
that
it
s
judy
my
friend
my
other
self
do
you
think
we
can
drag
all
that
out
of
it
do
you
think
a
tie
like
that
can
be
broken
by
an
accident
by
a
misfortune
with
it
all
i
adore
judy
harbottle
i
love
her
as
i
have
always
loved
her
and
it
s
damnable
but
i
don
t
know
whether
whatever
happened
i
wouldn
t
go
on
loving
finish
your
peg
i
said
she
was
sobbing
where
i
blame
myself
most
she
went
on
is
for
not
seeing
in
him
all
that
makes
him
mature
to
her
that
makes
her
forget
the
absurd
difference
between
them
and
take
him
simply
and
sincerely
as
i
know
she
does
as
the
contemporary
of
her
soul
if
not
of
her
body
i
saw
none
of
that
could
i
as
his
mother
would
he
show
it
to
me
i
thought
him
just
a
charming
boy
clever
too
of
course
with
nice
instincts
and
well
plucked
we
were
always
proud
of
that
with
his
delicate
physique
just
a
boy
i
haven
t
yet
stopped
thinking
how
different
he
looks
without
his
curls
and
i
thought
she
would
be
just
kind
and
gracious
and
delightful
to
him
because
he
was
my
there
of
course
i
said
is
the
only
where
what
he
is
your
would
you
have
me
appeal
to
her
do
you
know
i
don
t
think
i
could
dear
me
no
your
case
must
present
itself
it
must
spring
upon
her
and
grow
before
her
out
of
your
silence
and
if
you
can
manage
it
your
confidence
there
is
a
great
deal
after
all
remember
to
hold
her
in
that
i
can
t
somehow
imagine
her
failing
you
otherwise
lady
chichele
and
i
exchanged
a
glance
of
candid
admission
otherwise
she
would
be
capable
of
sacrificing
everything
everything
of
gathering
her
life
into
an
hour
i
know
and
do
you
know
if
the
thing
were
less
impossible
less
grotesque
i
should
not
be
so
much
afraid
i
mean
that
the
absolute
indefensibility
of
it
might
bring
her
a
recklessness
and
a
momentum
which
might
send
her
over
the
verge
i
said
well
go
home
and
ask
her
to
there
was
a
good
deal
more
to
say
of
course
than
i
have
thought
proper
to
put
down
here
but
before
anna
went
i
saw
that
she
was
keyed
up
to
the
heroic
part
this
was
none
the
less
to
her
credit
because
it
was
the
only
part
the
dictation
of
a
sense
of
expediency
that
despaired
while
it
dictated
the
noble
thing
was
her
capacity
to
take
it
and
amid
all
that
warred
in
her
to
carry
it
out
on
the
brave
high
lines
of
her
inspiration
it
seemed
a
literal
inspiration
so
perfectly
calculated
that
it
was
hard
not
to
think
sometimes
when
one
saw
them
together
that
anna
had
been
lulled
into
a
simple
resumption
of
the
old
relation
then
from
the
least
thing
possible
the
lift
of
an
eyelid
it
flashed
upon
one
that
between
these
two
every
moment
was
dramatic
and
one
took
up
the
word
with
a
curious
sense
of
detachment
and
futility
but
with
one
s
heart
beating
like
a
with
the
mad
excitement
of
it
the
acute
thing
was
the
splendid
sincerity
of
judy
harbottle
s
response
for
days
she
was
profoundly
on
her
guard
then
suddenly
she
seemed
to
become
practically
vividly
aware
of
what
i
must
go
on
calling
the
great
chance
and
passionately
to
fling
herself
upon
it
it
was
the
strangest
cooperation
without
a
word
or
a
sign
to
show
it
conscious
a
playing
together
for
stakes
that
could
not
be
admitted
a
thing
to
hang
upon
breathless
it
was
there
between
them
the
tenable
ground
of
what
they
were
to
each
other
they
occupied
it
with
almost
an
equal
eye
upon
the
tide
that
threatened
while
i
from
my
mainland
tower
also
made
an
anguished
calculation
of
the
chances
i
think
in
spite
of
the
menace
they
found
real
beatitudes
so
keenly
did
they
set
about
the
business
that
it
brought
them
moments
finer
than
any
they
could
count
in
the
years
that
were
behind
them
the
flat
and
colourless
years
that
were
gone
once
or
twice
the
wild
idea
even
visited
me
that
it
was
after
all
the
projection
of
his
mother
in
somers
that
had
so
seized
judy
harbottle
and
that
the
original
was
all
that
was
needed
to
help
the
happy
process
of
detachment
somers
himself
at
the
time
was
a
good
deal
away
on
escort
duty
they
had
a
clear
field
i
can
not
tell
exactly
when
between
harbottle
and
myself
it
became
a
matter
for
reference
more
or
less
overt
i
mean
her
defined
problem
the
thing
that
went
about
between
her
and
the
sun
it
will
be
imagined
that
it
did
not
come
up
like
the
weather
indeed
it
was
hardly
ever
to
be
envisaged
and
never
to
be
held
but
it
was
always
there
and
out
of
our
joint
consciousness
it
would
sometimes
leap
and
pass
without
shape
or
face
it
might
slip
between
two
sentences
or
it
might
remain
a
dogging
shadow
for
an
hour
or
a
week
would
go
by
while
with
a
strong
hand
she
held
it
out
of
sight
altogether
and
talked
of
anna
always
of
anna
her
eyes
shone
with
the
things
she
told
me
then
she
seemed
to
keep
herself
under
the
influence
of
them
as
if
they
had
the
power
of
narcotics
at
the
end
of
a
time
like
this
she
turned
to
me
in
the
door
as
she
was
going
and
stood
silent
as
if
she
could
neither
go
nor
stay
i
had
been
able
to
make
nothing
of
her
that
afternoon
she
had
seemed
preoccupied
with
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
which
she
traced
continually
with
her
riding
crop
and
finally
i
too
had
relapsed
she
sat
haggard
with
the
fight
forever
in
her
eyes
and
the
day
seemed
to
sombre
about
her
in
her
corner
when
she
turned
in
the
door
i
looked
up
with
sudden
prescience
of
a
crisis
don
t
jump
she
said
it
was
only
to
tell
you
that
i
have
persuaded
robert
to
apply
for
furlough
eighteen
months
from
the
first
of
april
don
t
touch
i
suppose
i
made
a
movement
towards
her
certainly
i
wanted
to
throw
my
arms
about
her
with
the
instinct
i
suppose
to
steady
her
in
her
great
resolution
at
the
end
of
that
time
as
you
know
he
will
be
retired
i
had
some
trouble
he
is
so
keen
on
the
regiment
but
i
think
i
have
succeeded
you
might
mention
it
to
haven
t
you
sprang
past
my
lips
i
can
t
it
would
be
like
taking
an
oath
to
tell
her
and
i
can
t
take
an
oath
to
go
but
i
mean
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
i
brought
out
feeling
indeed
that
there
was
not
but
i
congratulate
you
no
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
and
you
congratulate
me
no
doubt
she
stood
for
a
moment
quivering
in
the
isolation
she
made
for
herself
and
i
felt
a
primitive
angry
revolt
against
the
delicate
trafficking
of
souls
that
could
end
in
such
ravage
and
disaster
the
price
was
too
heavy
i
would
have
denuded
her
at
the
moment
of
all
that
had
led
her
into
this
and
turned
her
out
a
clod
with
fine
shoulders
like
fifty
other
women
in
peshawur
then
perhaps
because
i
held
myself
silent
and
remote
and
she
had
no
emotion
of
fear
from
me
she
did
not
immediately
go
it
will
beat
itself
away
i
suppose
like
the
rest
of
the
unreasonable
pain
of
the
world
she
said
at
last
and
that
of
course
brought
me
to
her
side
things
will
go
back
to
their
proportions
this
she
touched
an
open
rose
will
claim
its
beauty
again
and
life
will
become
perhaps
what
it
was
still
i
found
nothing
to
say
i
could
only
put
my
arm
in
hers
and
walk
with
her
to
the
edge
of
the
veranda
where
the
syce
was
holding
her
horse
she
stroked
the
animal
s
neck
everything
in
me
answered
him
she
informed
me
with
the
grave
intelligence
of
a
patient
who
relates
a
symptom
past
as
she
took
the
reins
she
turned
to
me
again
his
spirit
came
to
mine
like
a
homing
bird
she
said
and
in
her
smile
even
the
pale
reflection
of
happiness
was
sweet
and
stirring
it
left
me
hanging
in
imagination
over
the
source
and
the
stream
a
little
blessed
in
the
mere
understanding
too
much
blessed
for
confidence
or
any
safe
feeling
that
the
source
was
bound
rather
i
saw
it
leaping
over
every
obstacle
flashing
to
its
destiny
as
i
drove
to
the
club
next
day
i
decided
that
i
would
not
tell
anna
chichele
of
colonel
harbottle
s
projected
furlough
if
to
judy
telling
her
would
be
like
taking
an
oath
that
they
would
go
to
me
it
would
at
least
be
like
assuming
sponsorship
for
their
intention
that
would
be
heavy
indeed
from
the
first
of
april
we
were
then
in
march
anna
would
hear
it
soon
enough
from
the
general
would
see
it
soon
enough
almost
in
the
gazette
when
it
would
have
passed
into
irrecoverable
fact
so
i
went
by
her
with
locked
lips
kept
out
of
the
way
of
those
eyes
of
the
mother
that
asked
and
asked
and
would
have
seen
clear
to
any
depth
any
of
knowledge
like
that
as
i
pulled
up
at
the
club
i
saw
colonel
harbottle
talking
concernedly
to
the
wife
of
our
and
was
reminded
that
i
had
not
heard
for
some
days
how
major
watkins
was
going
on
so
i
too
approached
watkins
in
her
victoria
to
ask
robert
harbottle
kindly
forestalled
her
reply
hard
luck
isn
t
it
watkins
has
been
ordered
home
at
once
just
settled
into
their
new
house
too
last
of
the
kit
came
up
from
calcutta
yesterday
didn
t
it
watkins
but
it
s
sound
to
go
peshawur
is
the
worst
hole
in
asia
to
shake
off
dysentery
we
agreed
upon
this
and
discussed
the
of
her
new
furniture
that
watkins
would
have
to
send
round
the
station
and
considered
the
chances
of
a
trooper
to
the
watkinses
with
two
children
and
not
a
penny
but
his
pay
it
did
make
it
easier
not
to
have
to
go
by
a
liner
and
colonel
harbottle
and
i
were
halfway
to
the
before
the
significance
of
major
watkins
s
flashed
upon
me
but
this
i
cried
will
make
a
difference
to
your
plans
you
won
t
be
able
to
ask
for
that
furlough
judy
wants
rather
not
i
m
afraid
she
s
disappointed
she
was
tremendously
set
on
going
but
it
doesn
t
matter
tuppence
to
i
sought
out
harbottle
at
the
end
of
the
room
she
looked
radiant
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
swung
a
heel
she
was
talking
to
people
who
in
themselves
were
a
witness
to
high
spirits
captain
the
hon
freddy
gisborne
flamboys
at
sight
of
me
her
face
clouded
fell
suddenly
into
the
old
weary
lines
it
made
me
feel
somehow
a
little
sick
i
went
back
to
my
cart
and
drove
home
for
more
than
a
week
i
did
not
see
her
except
when
i
met
her
riding
with
somers
chichele
along
the
road
that
leads
to
the
the
trees
were
all
in
blossom
and
made
a
picture
that
might
well
catch
dreaming
hearts
into
a
beatitude
that
would
correspond
the
air
was
full
of
spring
and
the
scent
of
violets
those
wonderful
peshawur
violets
that
grow
in
great
clumps
tall
and
double
gracious
clouds
came
and
trailed
across
the
frontier
barrier
blue
as
an
idyll
it
rose
about
us
the
city
smiled
in
her
gardens
she
had
it
all
in
her
face
poor
judy
all
the
spring
softness
and
more
the
morning
she
came
intensely
controlled
to
announce
her
defeat
i
was
in
the
doing
the
flowers
i
put
them
down
to
look
at
her
the
wonderful
telegram
from
simla
arrived
that
was
the
wonderful
part
at
the
same
time
i
remembered
how
the
red
white
and
blue
turban
of
the
telegraph
peon
bobbed
up
behind
her
shoulder
in
the
veranda
i
signed
and
laid
it
on
the
table
i
suppose
it
seemed
hardly
likely
that
anything
could
be
important
enough
to
interfere
at
the
moment
with
my
impression
of
what
love
unbound
and
victorious
could
do
with
a
face
i
thought
i
knew
love
sat
there
careless
of
the
issue
full
of
delight
love
proclaimed
that
between
him
and
judith
harbottle
it
was
all
over
she
had
met
him
alas
in
too
narrow
a
place
and
i
marvelled
at
the
paradox
with
which
he
softened
every
curve
and
underlined
every
vivid
note
of
personality
in
token
that
it
had
just
begun
he
sat
there
in
great
serenity
and
though
i
knew
that
somewhere
behind
lurked
a
vanquished
woman
i
saw
her
through
such
a
radiance
that
i
could
not
be
sure
of
seeing
her
at
all
she
went
back
to
the
very
first
of
it
she
seemed
herself
intensely
interested
in
the
facts
and
there
is
no
use
in
pretending
that
while
she
talked
the
moral
consideration
was
at
all
present
with
me
either
it
wasn
t
her
extremity
was
the
thing
that
absorbed
us
she
even
in
tender
thoughtfulness
diagnosed
it
from
its
definite
beautiful
beginning
it
was
there
in
my
heart
when
i
woke
one
morning
exquisite
and
strange
the
assurance
of
a
gift
how
had
it
come
there
while
i
slept
i
assure
you
when
i
closed
my
eyes
it
did
not
exist
for
me
yes
of
course
i
had
seen
him
but
only
somewhere
at
dinner
as
the
day
went
on
it
changed
it
turned
into
a
clear
pool
into
a
flower
and
i
think
of
my
not
understanding
i
was
pleased
with
it
for
a
long
time
for
days
i
never
dreamed
that
it
could
be
anything
but
a
little
secret
joy
then
suddenly
oh
i
had
not
been
perceiving
enough
it
was
in
all
my
veins
a
tide
an
efflorescence
a
thing
of
my
very
life
then
it
was
a
little
late
i
understood
and
since
i
began
by
hating
it
being
furious
furious
and
afraid
too
sometimes
it
was
like
a
low
cloud
hovering
and
travelling
always
with
me
sometimes
like
a
beast
of
prey
that
went
a
little
way
off
and
sat
looking
at
me
i
have
done
my
best
but
there
is
nothing
to
do
to
kill
to
abolish
how
can
i
say
i
will
not
let
you
in
when
it
is
already
there
how
can
i
assume
indifference
when
this
thing
is
imposed
upon
every
moment
of
my
day
and
it
has
grown
so
sweet
the
longing
that
isn
t
it
strange
i
could
more
willingly
give
him
up
than
the
desire
of
him
that
seems
as
impossible
to
part
with
as
life
she
sat
reflective
for
a
moment
and
i
saw
her
eyes
slowly
fill
don
t
don
t
cry
judy
i
faltered
wanting
to
horribly
myself
she
smiled
them
dry
not
now
but
i
am
giving
myself
i
suppose
to
many
god
help
you
i
said
what
else
was
there
to
say
there
is
no
such
person
she
replied
gaily
there
is
only
a
blessed
then
you
go
all
the
way
to
the
logical
conclusion
she
hardly
hesitated
to
the
logical
conclusion
what
poor
words
may
i
ask
when
i
should
like
to
tell
you
that
quite
definitely
and
i
think
i
can
the
english
mail
leaves
and
you
have
arranged
to
take
it
we
have
arranged
nothing
do
you
know
she
smiled
as
if
at
the
fresh
colours
of
an
idyll
we
have
not
even
come
to
the
admission
there
has
been
between
us
no
word
no
vision
ah
we
have
gone
in
bonds
and
dumb
hours
we
have
had
exquisite
hours
of
the
spirit
but
never
a
moment
of
the
heart
a
moment
confessed
it
was
mine
to
give
that
moment
and
he
has
waited
i
know
wondering
whether
perhaps
it
would
ever
come
and
today
we
are
going
for
a
ride
today
and
i
do
not
think
we
shall
come
o
judy
i
cried
catching
at
her
sleeve
he
is
only
a
boy
there
were
times
when
i
thought
that
conclusive
now
the
misery
of
it
has
gone
to
sleep
don
t
waken
it
it
pleases
me
to
believe
that
the
years
are
a
convention
i
never
had
any
dignity
you
know
and
i
seem
to
have
missed
the
moral
deliverance
i
only
want
oh
you
know
what
i
want
why
don
t
you
open
your
telegram
i
had
been
folding
and
fingering
the
brown
envelope
as
if
it
had
been
a
scrap
of
waste
paper
it
is
probably
from
watkins
about
the
victoria
i
said
feeling
its
profound
irrelevance
i
wired
an
offer
to
her
in
bombay
however
and
i
read
the
telegram
the
little
solving
telegram
from
army
headquarters
i
turned
my
back
on
her
to
read
it
again
and
then
i
replaced
it
very
carefully
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
it
was
a
moment
to
take
hold
of
with
both
hands
crying
on
all
one
s
gods
for
steadiness
how
white
you
look
said
harbottle
with
concern
not
bad
news
on
the
contrary
excellent
news
judy
will
you
stay
to
lunch
she
looked
at
me
hesitating
won
t
it
seem
rather
a
compromise
on
your
part
when
you
ought
to
be
rousing
the
city
i
don
t
intend
to
rouse
the
city
i
said
i
have
given
you
the
thank
you
i
said
grimly
but
the
only
real
favour
you
can
do
me
is
to
stay
to
it
was
then
just
on
one
i
ll
stay
she
said
if
you
will
promise
not
to
make
any
sort
of
effort
i
shouldn
t
mind
but
it
would
distress
i
promise
absolutely
i
said
and
ironical
joy
rose
up
in
me
and
the
telegram
burned
in
my
pocket
she
would
talk
of
it
though
i
found
it
hard
to
let
her
go
on
knowing
and
knowing
and
knowing
as
i
did
that
for
that
day
at
least
it
could
not
be
there
was
very
little
about
herself
that
she
wanted
to
tell
me
she
was
there
confessed
a
woman
whom
joy
had
overcome
it
was
understood
that
we
both
accepted
that
situation
but
in
the
details
which
she
asked
me
to
take
charge
of
it
was
plain
that
she
also
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
fate
matters
of
business
we
were
in
the
the
little
round
clock
in
its
armritsar
case
marked
three
judy
put
down
her
coffee
cup
and
rose
to
go
as
she
glanced
at
the
clock
the
light
deepened
in
her
eyes
and
i
with
her
hand
in
mine
felt
like
an
agent
of
the
destroyer
for
it
was
three
consumed
myself
with
fear
lest
the
blow
had
miscarried
then
as
we
stood
suddenly
the
sound
of
hoofs
at
a
gallop
on
the
drive
and
my
husband
threw
himself
off
at
the
door
and
tore
through
the
hall
to
his
room
and
in
the
certainty
that
overwhelmed
me
even
judy
for
an
instant
stood
dim
and
remote
major
jim
seems
to
be
in
a
hurry
said
harbottle
lightly
i
have
always
liked
your
husband
i
wonder
whether
he
will
say
tomorrow
that
he
always
liked
dear
judy
i
don
t
think
he
will
be
occupied
with
you
oh
surely
just
a
little
if
i
go
you
won
t
go
she
looked
at
me
helplessly
i
felt
as
if
i
were
insisting
upon
her
abasement
instead
of
her
salvation
i
wish
you
re
not
going
you
re
not
you
can
t
look
i
pulled
it
out
of
my
pocket
and
thrust
it
at
her
the
telegram
it
came
against
every
regulation
from
my
good
friend
the
deputy
in
simla
and
it
read
row
khurram
probably
ordered
front
three
hours
her
face
changed
how
my
heart
leaped
to
see
it
change
and
that
took
command
there
which
will
command
trampling
even
in
the
women
of
the
camp
at
news
like
this
what
luck
that
bob
couldn
t
take
his
furlough
she
exclaimed
but
you
have
known
this
for
hours
there
was
even
something
of
the
colonel
s
wife
authority
incisiveness
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
ah
i
i
stood
before
her
abashed
and
that
was
ridiculous
while
she
measured
me
as
if
i
presented
in
myself
the
woman
i
took
her
to
be
it
wasn
t
like
that
she
said
i
had
to
defend
myself
judy
i
said
if
you
weren
t
in
honour
bound
to
anna
how
could
i
know
that
you
would
be
in
honour
bound
to
the
regiment
there
was
a
train
at
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
you
have
overcalculated
said
harbottle
her
eyes
were
hard
and
proud
and
i
am
not
sure
a
deep
red
swept
over
her
face
a
man
s
blush
in
the
light
of
this
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
not
in
honour
bound
to
we
had
reached
the
veranda
and
at
her
signal
her
coachman
drove
quickly
up
you
have
kept
me
here
three
hours
when
there
was
the
whole
of
bob
s
kit
to
see
to
she
said
as
she
flung
herself
in
you
might
have
thought
of
it
was
a
more
than
usually
tedious
campaign
and
colonel
robert
harbottle
was
ambushed
and
shot
in
a
place
where
one
must
believe
pure
boredom
induced
him
to
take
his
men
the
incident
was
relieved
the
newspapers
said
and
they
are
seldom
so
clever
in
finding
relief
for
such
incidents
by
the
dash
and
courage
shown
by
lieutenant
chichele
who
in
one
of
those
feats
which
it
has
lately
been
the
fashion
to
criticize
carried
the
mortally
wounded
body
of
his
colonel
out
of
range
at
conspicuous
risk
of
depriving
the
queen
of
another
officer
i
helped
judy
with
her
silent
packing
she
had
forgiven
me
long
before
that
and
she
settled
almost
at
once
into
the
flat
in
chelsea
which
has
since
been
credited
with
so
delightful
an
atmosphere
went
back
straight
into
her
own
world
i
have
always
kept
her
first
letters
about
it
always
shall
for
months
after
while
the
expedition
still
raged
after
snipers
and
i
discussed
with
lady
chichele
the
probable
outcome
of
it
all
i
have
sometimes
felt
ashamed
of
leaping
as
straight
as
i
did
with
anna
to
what
we
thought
the
inevitable
i
based
no
calculation
on
all
harbottle
had
gone
back
to
just
as
i
had
based
no
calculation
on
her
ten
years
companionship
in
arms
when
i
kept
her
from
the
three
o
clock
train
this
last
was
a
retrospection
in
which
anna
naturally
could
not
join
me
she
never
knew
poor
dear
how
fortunate
as
to
its
moment
was
the
campaign
she
deplored
and
nothing
to
this
day
can
have
disturbed
her
conviction
that
the
bond
she
was
at
such
magnificent
pains
to
strengthen
held
against
the
strain
as
long
happily
as
the
supreme
need
existed
how
right
you
were
she
often
said
she
did
after
all
love
me
best
dear
wonderful
judy
her
distress
about
poor
robert
harbottle
was
genuine
enough
but
one
could
not
be
surprised
at
a
certain
ambiguity
one
tear
for
robert
so
to
speak
and
two
for
her
boy
it
could
hardly
be
for
him
a
marriage
after
his
mother
s
heart
and
she
laid
down
with
some
emphasis
that
somers
was
brilliantly
entitled
to
all
he
was
likely
to
get
which
was
natural
too
i
had
been
from
the
beginning
so
much
in
it
that
anna
showed
me
a
year
later
though
i
don
t
believe
she
liked
doing
it
the
letter
in
part
of
which
harbottle
shall
finally
excuse
herself
somers
will
give
you
this
i
read
and
with
it
take
back
your
son
you
will
not
find
i
know
anything
grotesque
in
the
charming
enthusiasm
with
which
he
has
offered
his
life
to
me
you
understand
too
well
you
are
too
kind
and
if
you
wonder
that
i
can
so
render
up
a
dear
thing
which
i
might
keep
and
would
once
have
taken
think
how
sweet
in
the
desert
is
the
pool
and
how
barren
was
the
prospect
from
it
was
like
her
to
abandon
in
pride
a
happiness
that
asked
so
much
less
humiliation
i
don
t
know
why
but
it
was
like
her
and
of
course
when
one
thought
of
it
she
had
consulted
all
sorts
of
high
expediencies
but
i
sat
silent
with
remembrance
quieting
a
pang
in
my
heart
trying
not
to
calculate
how
much
it
had
cost
judy
harbottle
to
take
her
second
chance
