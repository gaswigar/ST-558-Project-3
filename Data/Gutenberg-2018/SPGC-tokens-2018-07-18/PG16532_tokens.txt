when
an
american
sets
out

found

hunts

for
a
hill
john
harvard
was
an
englishman
and
indifferent
to
high
places
the
result
is
that
harvard
has
become
a
university
of
vast
proportions
and
no
color
yale
flounders
about
among
the
new
haven
shops
trying
to
rise
above
them
the
harkness
memorial
tower
is
successful
otherwise
the
university
smells
of
trade
if
yale
had
been
built
on
a
hill
it
would
probably
be
far
less
important
and
much
more
interesting
hezekiah
sanford
was
wise
he
found
first
his
hill
and
then
founded
his
college
believing
probably
that
any
one
ambitious
enough
to
climb
the
hill
was
a
man
fit
to
wrestle
with
learning
and
if
need
be
with
satan
himself
satan
was
ever
before
hezekiah
and
he
fought
him
valiantly
exorcising
him
every
morning
in
chapel
and
every
evening
at
prayers
the
first
students
of
sanford
college
learned
latin
and
greek
and
to
fear
the
devil
there
are
some
who
declare
that
their
successors
learn
less
hezekiah
built
sanford
hall
a
fine
georgian
building
performed
the
duties
of
trustees
president
dean
and
faculty
for
thirty
years
and
then
passed
to
his
reward
leaving
three
thousand
acres
his
library
of
five
hundred
books
mostly
sermons
sanford
hall
and
a
charter
that
opened
the
gates
of
sanford
to
all
men
so
that
they
might
find
the
true
light
of
god
and
the
glory
of
jesus
in
the
halls
of
this
most
liberal
college
more
than
a
century
had
passed
since
hezekiah
was
laid
to
rest
in
haydensville
cemetery
the
college
had
grown
miraculously
and
changed
even
more
miraculously
only
the
hill
and
its
beautiful
surroundings
remained
the
same
indian
lake
on
the
south
of
the
campus
still
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
on
the
east
the
woods
were
as
virgin
as
they
had
been
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
haydensville
still
only
a
village
surrounded
the
college
on
the
west
and
north
hezekiah
successors
had
done
strange
things
to
his
campus
there
were
dozens
of
buildings
now
surrounding
sanford
hall
and
they
revealed
all
the
types
of
architecture
popular
since
hezekiah
had
thundered
his
last
defiance
at
satan
there
were
fine
old
colonial
buildings
their
windows
outlined
by
english
ivy
ponderous
romanesque
buildings
made
of
stone
grotesque
and
hideous
a
chapel
with
a
tower
of
surpassing
loveliness
and
four
laboratories
of
the
purest
factory
design
but
despite
the
conglomerate
and
sometimes
absurd
architecture
a
doric
temple
neighbored
a
byzantine
mosque
the
campus
was
beautiful
lawns
often
terraced
stretched
everywhere
and
the
great
elms
lent
a
dignity
to
sanford
college
that
no
architect
however
stupid
could
quite
efface
this
first
day
of
the
new
college
year
was
glorious
in
the
golden
haze
of
indian
summer
the
lake
was
silver
blue
the
long
reflections
of
the
trees
twisting
and
bending
as
a
soft
breeze
ruffled
the
surface
into
tiny
waves
the
hills
already
brilliant
with
color
scarlet
burnt
orange
mauve
and
purple
flamed
up
to
meet
the
clear
blue
sky
the
elms
softly
rustled
their
drying
leaves
the
white
houses
of
the
village
retreated
coyly
behind
maples
and
firs
and
elms
everywhere
there
was
peace
the
peace
that
comes
with
strength
that
has
been
stronger
than
time
as
hugh
carver
hastened
up
the
hill
from
the
station
his
two
banged
his
legs
and
tripped
him
he
could
hardly
wait
to
reach
the
campus
the
journey
had
been
intolerably
long
haydensville
was
more
than
three
hundred
miles
from
merrytown
his
home
and
he
was
wild
to
find
his
room
in
surrey
hall
he
wondered
how
he
would
like
his
peters
what
his
name
oh
yes
carl
the
registrar
had
written
that
peters
had
gone
to
kane
school
must
be
pretty
fine
ought
to
be
to
room
with
hugh
hoped
that
peters
think
that
he
was
too
country
hugh
was
a
slender
lad
who
looked
considerably
less
than
his
eighteen
years
a
gray
cap
concealed
his
sandy
brown
hair
which
he
parted
on
the
side
and
which
curled
despite
all
his
brushing
his
crystalline
blue
eyes
his
small
neatly
carved
nose
his
sensitive
mouth
that
hid
a
shy
and
appealing
smile
were
all
very
boyish
he
seemed
young
almost
pathetically
young
people
invariably
called
him
a
nice
boy
and
he
did
like
it
in
fact
he
wanted
to
know
how
they
got
that
way
they
gave
him
the
pip
what
they
did
he
guessed
that
a
fellow
who
could
run
the
hundred
in
and
anybody
in
high
school
was
such
a
baby
why
he
had
overheard
one
of
the
old
maid
teachers
call
him
sweet
sweet
cripes
that
old
hen
made
him
sick
she
was
always
pawing
him
and
sticking
her
skinny
hands
in
his
hair
he
was
darn
glad
to
get
to
college
where
there
were
only
men
teachers
women
always
wanted
to
get
their
hands
into
his
hair
and
boys
liked
him
on
sight
many
of
those
who
were
streaming
up
the
hill
before
and
behind
him
who
passed
him
or
whom
he
passed
glanced
at
his
eager
face
and
thought
that
there
was
a
guy
they
like
to
know
an
experienced
observer
would
have
divided
those
boys
into
three
groups
preparatory
school
boys
carelessly
at
ease
well
dressed
or
as
the
college
argot
has
it
smooth
boys
from
city
schools
not
so
well
dressed
perhaps
certainly
not
so
sure
of
themselves
and
country
boys
many
of
them
miserably
confused
and
some
of
them
clad
in
kollege
kut
klothes
that
they
would
shamefacedly
discard
within
a
week
hugh
finally
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
the
campus
was
before
him
he
had
visited
the
college
once
with
his
father
and
knew
his
way
about
eager
as
he
was
to
reach
surrey
hall
he
paused
to
admire
the
chapel
he
felt
a
little
thrill
of
pride
as
he
stared
in
awe
at
the
magnificent
building
it
had
been
willed
to
the
college
by
an
alumnus
who
had
made
millions
selling
rotten
pork
hugh
skirted
two
of
the
factory
laboratories
hurried
between
the
doric
temple
and
byzantine
mosque
paused
five
times
to
direct
confused
classmates
passed
a
dull
red
colonial
building
and
finally
stood
before
surrey
hall
a
large
brick
dormitory
half
covered
by
ivy
he
hurried
and
down
a
corridor
until
he
found
a
door
with
on
it
he
knocked
what
th
hell
come
in
the
voice
was
impatiently
cheerful
hugh
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
room
to
meet
wild
confusion
and
his
the
room
was
a
clutter
of
trunks
clothes
banners
unpacked
furniture
pillows
pictures
and
photographs
dozens
of
photographs
all
of
them
of
girls
apparently
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
boy
was
on
his
knees
before
an
open
trunk
he
had
sleek
black
hair
parted
meticulously
in
the
center
a
slender
face
with
rather
sharp
features
and
large
black
eyes
that
almost
glittered
his
lips
were
full
and
very
red
almost
too
red
and
his
cheeks
seemed
to
be
colored
with
a
hard
blush
hullo
he
said
in
a
clear
voice
as
hugh
came
in
who
are
you
hugh
flushed
slightly
i
carver
he
answered
hugh
carver
the
other
lad
jumped
to
his
feet
revealing
to
hugh
surprise
golf
knickers
he
was
tall
slender
and
very
neatly
built
hell
he
exclaimed
i
ought
to
have
guessed
that
he
held
out
his
hand
i
carl
peters
the
guy
you
got
to
room
with
and
god
help
you
hugh
dropped
his
and
shook
hands
guess
i
can
stand
it
he
said
with
a
quick
laugh
to
hide
his
embarrassment
maybe
you
need
a
little
of
god
help
yourself
diffident
and
unsure
he
smiled
and
peters
liked
him
on
the
spot
chase
yourself
peters
said
easily
i
know
a
good
guy
when
i
see
one
sit
down
somewhere
er
here
he
brushed
a
pile
of
clothes
off
a
trunk
to
the
floor
with
one
sweep
of
his
arm
rest
yourself
after
climbing
that
goddamn
hill
christ
it
a
bastard
that
hill
is
say
your
trunk
i
saw
it
i
help
you
bring
it
up
soon
got
your
wind
hugh
was
rather
dazzled
by
the
rapid
staccato
talk
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
a
little
shocked
by
the
profanity
not
that
he
was
used
to
profanity
he
had
heard
plenty
of
that
in
merrytown
but
he
expect
somehow
that
a
college
man
that
is
a
man
would
use
it
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
make
some
reply
to
peters
talk
but
he
did
know
just
what
would
do
peters
saved
him
the
trouble
i
tell
you
carver
oh
hell
i
going
to
call
you
hugh
going
to
have
a
swell
joint
here
quite
the
darb
three
rooms
you
know
a
bedroom
for
each
of
us
and
this
big
study
i
brought
most
of
the
junk
that
i
had
at
kane
and
i
you
got
some
of
your
own
not
much
hugh
replied
rather
ashamed
of
what
he
thought
might
be
considered
stinginess
he
hastened
to
explain
that
he
did
know
what
carl
would
have
so
he
thought
that
he
had
better
wait
and
get
his
stuff
at
college
that
the
bean
exclaimed
carl
he
had
perched
himself
on
the
he
threw
one
well
shaped
leg
over
the
other
and
gazed
at
hugh
admiringly
you
certainly
used
the
old
bean
say
i
got
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
truck
here
and
if
you
a
brought
much
we
a
been
swamped
say
i
tell
you
how
we
fix
this
dump
he
jumped
up
led
hugh
on
a
tour
of
the
rooms
discussed
the
disposal
of
the
various
pieces
of
furniture
with
enormous
gusto
and
finally
pointed
to
the
photographs
hope
you
do
mind
my
harem
he
said
making
a
poor
attempt
to
hide
his
pride
it
some
harem
replied
hugh
in
honest
awe
again
he
felt
ashamed
he
had
pictures
of
his
father
and
mother
and
that
was
all
he
write
to
helen
for
one
right
away
where
you
get
all
of
you
certainly
got
a
collection
sure
have
the
album
of
hearts
i
broken
when
i
kissed
a
girl
twice
i
make
her
give
me
her
picture
i
forgotten
the
names
of
some
of
these
janes
i
collected
ten
at
bar
harbor
this
summer
and
three
at
christmas
cove
say
this
kid
he
fished
through
a
pile
of
pictures
was
the
hottest
little
devil
i
ever
met
he
passed
to
hugh
a
cabinet
photograph
of
a
standard
flapper
pet
my
god
he
cast
his
eyes
ceilingward
ecstatically
hugh
mind
was
a
of
disapproval
and
envy
carl
dazzled
and
confused
him
he
had
often
listened
to
the
recitals
of
their
exploits
by
the
merrytown
don
juans
but
this
sophisticated
lad
evidently
had
a
technique
and
breadth
of
experience
quite
unknown
to
merrytown
he
wanted
badly
to
hear
more
but
time
was
flying
and
he
had
even
begun
to
unpack
will
you
help
me
bring
up
my
trunk
he
asked
half
shyly
oh
hell
yes
i
forgotten
all
about
that
come
on
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
unpacking
arranging
and
rearranging
the
furniture
and
pictures
they
found
a
restaurant
and
had
dinner
then
they
returned
to
surrey
and
rearranged
the
furniture
once
more
pausing
occasionally
to
chat
while
carl
smoked
he
offered
hugh
a
cigarette
hugh
explained
that
he
did
not
smoke
that
he
was
a
sprinter
and
that
the
coaches
said
that
cigarettes
were
bad
for
a
runner
said
carl
respecting
the
reason
thoroughly
i
ca
run
worth
a
damn
myself
but
i
not
bad
at
tennis
not
very
good
either
say
if
you
a
runner
you
ought
to
make
a
fraternity
easy
got
your
eye
on
one
well
said
hugh
my
father
a
nu
delt
the
nu
delts
phew
as
hell
he
looked
at
hugh
enviously
say
you
certainly
are
set
well
my
old
man
never
went
to
college
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
he
left
us
a
whale
of
a
lot
of
jack
when
he
passed
out
a
couple
of
years
ago
what
hugh
exclaimed
staring
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
in
an
instant
carl
was
on
his
feet
his
flashing
eyes
dimmed
by
tears
my
old
man
was
the
best
scout
that
ever
lived
the
best
damned
old
scout
that
ever
lived
his
sophistication
was
all
gone
he
was
just
a
small
boy
heartily
ashamed
of
himself
and
ready
to
cry
i
want
you
to
know
that
he
ended
defiantly
at
once
hugh
was
all
sympathy
sure
i
know
he
said
softly
then
he
smiled
and
added
so
mine
carl
face
lost
its
lugubriousness
in
a
broad
grin
i
a
fish
he
announced
let
hit
the
hay
you
said
it
chapter
ii
hugh
wrote
two
letters
before
he
went
to
bed
one
to
his
mother
and
father
and
the
other
to
helen
simpson
his
letter
to
helen
was
very
brief
merely
a
request
for
her
photograph
then
his
mind
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
he
went
to
bed
and
lay
awake
dreaming
thinking
of
carl
the
college
and
most
of
all
of
helen
and
his
walk
with
her
the
day
before
he
had
called
on
her
to
say
they
had
been
going
together
for
a
year
and
she
was
generally
considered
his
girl
she
was
a
pretty
child
with
really
beautiful
brown
hair
which
she
had
foolishly
bobbed
lively
blue
eyes
and
an
absurdly
tiny
snub
nose
she
was
little
with
quick
eager
hands
a
shallow
creature
who
was
proud
to
be
seen
with
hugh
because
he
had
been
captain
of
the
track
team
but
she
did
wish
that
he
was
so
slow
why
he
had
kissed
her
only
once
and
that
had
been
a
silly
peck
on
the
cheek
perhaps
he
was
just
shy
but
sometimes
she
was
almost
sure
that
he
was
plain
dumb
they
had
walked
silently
along
the
country
road
to
the
woods
that
skirted
the
town
an
early
frost
had
already
touched
the
foliage
with
scarlet
and
orange
they
sat
down
on
a
fallen
log
and
hugh
gazed
at
a
radiant
helen
let
her
hand
drop
lightly
on
his
thinking
of
me
she
asked
softly
hugh
squeezed
her
hand
yes
he
whispered
and
looked
at
the
ground
while
he
scuffed
some
fallen
leaves
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
i
am
going
to
miss
you
hughie
oh
awfully
are
you
going
to
miss
me
he
held
her
hand
tightly
and
said
nothing
he
was
aware
only
of
her
hand
his
throat
seemed
to
be
stopped
choked
with
something
a
bird
that
should
have
been
on
its
way
south
chirped
from
a
tree
near
by
the
sound
made
hugh
look
up
he
noticed
that
the
shadows
were
lengthening
he
and
helen
would
have
to
start
back
pretty
soon
or
he
would
be
late
for
dinner
there
was
still
packing
to
do
his
mother
had
said
that
his
father
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
him
and
through
all
his
thoughts
there
ran
like
a
fiery
red
line
the
desire
to
kiss
the
girl
whose
hand
was
clasped
in
his
he
turned
slightly
toward
her
hughie
she
whispered
and
moved
close
to
him
his
heart
stopped
as
he
loosened
her
hand
from
his
and
put
his
arm
around
her
with
a
contented
sigh
she
rested
her
head
on
one
shoulder
and
her
hand
on
the
other
hughie
dear
she
breathed
softly
he
hesitated
no
longer
his
heart
was
beating
so
that
he
could
not
speak
but
he
bent
and
kissed
her
and
there
they
sat
for
half
an
hour
more
close
in
each
other
embrace
speaking
no
words
but
losing
themselves
in
kisses
that
seemed
to
have
no
end
finally
hugh
realized
that
darkness
had
fallen
he
drew
the
yielding
girl
to
her
feet
and
started
home
his
arm
around
her
when
they
reached
her
gate
he
embraced
her
once
more
and
kissed
her
as
if
he
could
never
let
her
go
a
light
flashed
in
a
window
frightened
he
tried
to
leave
but
she
clung
to
him
i
must
go
he
whispered
desperately
i
going
to
miss
you
awfully
he
thought
that
she
was
weeping
and
kissed
her
again
then
as
another
window
shot
light
into
the
yard
he
forced
her
arms
from
around
his
neck
helen
write
to
me
his
voice
was
rough
and
husky
oh
i
will
darling
he
walked
home
tingling
with
emotion
he
wanted
to
shout
he
felt
suddenly
grown
up
golly
but
helen
was
a
little
peach
he
felt
her
arms
around
his
neck
again
her
lips
pressed
maddeningly
to
his
for
an
instant
he
was
dizzy
as
he
lay
in
bed
in
surrey
thinking
of
helen
he
tried
to
summon
that
glorious
intoxication
again
but
he
failed
carl
the
college
registration
a
thousand
thoughts
intruded
themselves
already
helen
seemed
far
away
a
little
nebulous
he
wondered
why
chapter
iii
for
the
next
few
days
carl
and
hugh
did
little
but
wait
in
line
they
lined
up
to
register
they
lined
up
to
pay
tuition
they
lined
up
to
shake
hands
with
president
culver
they
lined
up
to
talk
for
two
quite
useless
minutes
with
the
freshman
dean
they
lined
up
to
be
assigned
seats
in
the
commons
carl
suggested
that
he
and
hugh
line
up
in
the
study
before
going
to
bed
so
that
they
would
keep
in
practice
then
they
had
to
attend
lectures
given
by
various
members
of
the
faculty
about
college
customs
college
manners
college
honor
college
everything
after
the
sixth
of
them
hugh
thoroughly
weary
and
utterly
confused
asked
carl
if
he
now
had
any
idea
of
what
college
was
yes
replied
carl
it
a
young
ladies
school
for
very
nice
boys
well
hugh
said
desperately
if
i
have
to
listen
to
about
two
more
awfully
noble
lectures
i
going
to
get
drunk
i
have
a
hunch
that
college
is
anything
like
what
these
old
birds
say
it
is
i
hope
not
anyway
course
it
is
say
why
wait
for
two
more
of
the
damn
things
to
kill
you
off
he
pulled
a
flask
out
of
his
desk
drawer
and
held
it
out
invitingly
hugh
laughed
you
told
me
yourself
that
that
stuff
was
catgut
and
that
you
would
drink
it
on
a
bet
besides
you
know
that
i
do
drink
if
i
going
to
make
my
letter
i
got
to
keep
in
trim
right
you
are
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
with
this
poison
if
i
leave
it
around
here
the
biddy
get
hold
of
it
and
then
god
help
us
tell
you
what
after
it
gets
dark
we
take
it
down
and
poison
the
waters
of
dear
old
indian
lake
all
right
say
i
got
to
pike
along
i
got
a
date
with
my
faculty
adviser
hope
i
do
have
to
stand
in
line
he
did
have
to
stand
in
line
he
was
permitted
to
sit
but
he
did
have
to
wait
an
hour
and
a
half
finally
a
student
came
out
of
the
inner
office
and
a
gruff
voice
from
within
called
next
just
like
a
barber
shop
flashed
across
hugh
mind
as
he
entered
the
tiny
office
an
man
was
sitting
behind
a
desk
shuffling
papers
he
glanced
up
as
hugh
came
in
and
motioned
him
to
a
chair
beside
him
hugh
sat
down
and
stared
at
his
feet
um
let
see
your
name
what
carver
sir
hugh
carver
the
adviser
professor
kane
glanced
at
some
notes
oh
yes
from
merrytown
high
school
fully
accredited
are
you
taking
an
or
a
i
i
do
know
you
have
to
have
one
year
of
college
latin
for
a
and
at
least
two
years
of
greek
besides
for
an
oh
hugh
was
frightened
and
confused
he
knew
that
his
father
was
an
but
he
had
heard
the
principal
say
that
greek
was
useless
nowadays
suddenly
he
remembered
the
principal
had
advised
him
to
take
a
he
had
said
that
it
was
more
practical
i
guess
i
better
take
a
he
said
softly
very
well
professor
kane
who
had
yet
looked
at
hugh
picked
up
a
schedule
card
any
middle
name
he
asked
abruptly
yes
sir
meredith
kane
scribbled
carver
at
the
top
of
the
card
and
then
proceeded
to
fill
it
in
rapidly
he
hastily
explained
the
symbols
that
he
was
using
but
he
did
not
say
anything
about
the
courses
when
he
had
completed
the
schedule
he
copied
it
on
another
card
handed
one
to
hugh
and
stuck
the
other
into
a
anything
else
he
asked
turning
his
blond
blank
face
toward
hugh
for
the
first
time
hugh
stood
up
there
were
a
dozen
questions
that
he
wanted
to
ask
no
sir
he
replied
very
well
then
i
am
your
regular
adviser
you
will
come
to
me
when
you
need
assistance
good
day
good
day
sir
and
as
hugh
passed
out
of
the
door
the
gruff
voice
bawled
next
the
boy
nearest
the
door
rose
and
entered
the
sanctum
hugh
sought
the
open
air
and
gazed
at
the
hieroglyphics
on
the
card
guess
they
mean
something
he
mused
but
how
am
i
going
to
find
out
a
sudden
fear
made
him
blanch
i
bet
i
get
into
the
wrong
places
oh
golly
then
came
the
nearly
seven
hundred
of
them
the
quiet
campus
became
a
bedlam
of
excitement
and
greetings
hi
jack
didya
have
a
good
summer
well
tom
ol
kid
i
sure
am
glad
to
see
you
put
her
there
ol
scout
it
sure
good
to
see
you
everywhere
the
same
greetings
didya
have
a
good
summer
glad
to
see
you
back
every
one
called
every
one
else
by
his
first
name
every
one
shook
hands
with
astonishing
vigor
usually
clutching
the
other
fellow
by
the
forearm
at
the
same
time
how
cockily
these
lads
went
around
the
campus
no
confusion
or
fear
for
them
they
knew
what
to
do
for
the
first
time
hugh
felt
a
pang
of
homesickness
for
the
first
time
he
realized
that
he
was
yet
part
of
the
college
he
clung
close
to
carl
and
one
or
two
other
lads
in
surrey
with
whom
he
picked
up
an
acquaintance
and
carl
clung
close
to
hugh
careful
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
felt
very
small
and
meek
for
the
first
time
realized
that
he
was
just
a
freshman
and
he
did
like
it
then
suddenly
the
tension
which
had
been
gathering
for
a
day
or
so
broke
orders
went
out
from
the
that
all
freshmen
put
on
their
baby
bonnets
silly
little
blue
caps
with
a
bright
orange
button
from
that
moment
every
freshman
was
doomed
work
was
their
lot
and
plenty
of
it
hi
freshman
carry
up
my
trunk
yeah
you
freshman
you
with
the
skinny
legs
you
and
your
fat
friend
carry
my
trunk
up
to
the
fourth
floor
and
if
you
drop
it
i
break
your
fool
freshman
go
down
to
the
station
and
get
my
here
are
the
checks
hurry
back
if
you
know
what
good
for
freshman
go
up
to
hill
and
put
the
beds
freshman
come
up
to
my
room
i
want
you
to
hang
pictures
fortunately
the
labor
did
not
last
long
but
while
it
lasted
hugh
was
hustled
around
as
he
never
had
been
before
and
he
loved
it
he
loved
his
blue
cap
and
its
orange
button
he
loved
the
who
called
him
freshman
and
ordered
him
around
he
loved
the
very
trunks
that
he
lugged
so
painfully
he
was
being
recognized
merely
as
a
janitor
it
is
true
but
recognized
at
last
he
was
a
part
of
sanford
college
further
one
of
the
men
who
had
ordered
him
around
the
most
fiercely
wore
a
nu
delta
pin
the
emblem
of
his
fraternity
he
ran
that
man
errands
with
such
speed
and
willingness
that
the
hero
decided
that
the
freshman
was
very
very
dumb
that
night
hugh
and
carl
sat
in
surrey
and
rested
their
aching
bones
one
on
a
couch
the
other
in
a
leather
morris
chair
hot
stuff
was
it
said
hugh
stretching
out
comfortably
hot
stuff
hell
how
do
they
get
that
way
never
mind
we
do
the
ordering
next
year
right
you
are
said
carl
decisively
lighting
a
cigarette
and
i
make
the
little
frosh
walk
he
gazed
around
the
room
his
face
beaming
with
satisfaction
say
we
pretty
snappy
here
are
we
hugh
too
looked
around
admiringly
the
walls
were
almost
hidden
by
banners
a
huge
sanford
blanket
hugh
greatest
contribution
kane
blanket
the
photographs
of
the
harem
posters
of
college
athletes
and
movie
and
three
maxfield
parrish
prints
it
certainly
is
fine
said
hugh
proudly
all
we
need
is
a
barber
pole
and
a
street
sign
we
have
before
the
week
is
out
this
with
great
decision
chapter
iv
carl
adviser
had
been
less
efficient
than
hugh
therefore
he
knew
what
his
courses
were
where
the
classes
met
and
the
hours
the
names
of
his
instructors
and
the
requirements
other
than
latin
for
a
degree
carl
said
that
he
was
taking
a
because
he
had
had
a
year
of
greek
at
kane
and
was
therefore
perfectly
competent
to
make
full
use
of
the
language
he
could
read
the
letters
on
the
front
doors
of
the
fraternity
houses
the
boys
found
that
their
courses
were
the
same
but
that
they
were
in
different
sections
hugh
was
in
a
dilemma
he
could
make
nothing
out
of
his
card
here
said
carl
give
the
thing
to
me
my
adviser
was
a
good
scout
and
wised
me
up
this
is
paper
cutting
as
you
might
suppose
it
gym
you
get
out
of
that
by
signing
up
for
track
means
physical
culture
think
of
that
you
can
sign
up
for
track
any
time
down
at
the
gym
and
e
i
means
that
you
in
english
i
section
and
m
is
math
you
re
in
section
lat
means
latin
of
course
section
my
adviser
he
tried
pretty
hard
to
be
funny
said
that
was
glorious
salvation
but
general
science
that
meets
in
the
big
lecture
hall
in
cranston
we
all
go
to
that
and
h
i
means
that
you
are
in
section
of
history
i
see
that
all
there
is
to
it
now
this
thing
he
held
up
a
printed
schedule
tells
you
where
the
classes
meet
with
a
great
deal
of
labor
discussion
and
profanity
they
finally
got
a
schedule
made
out
that
meant
something
to
hugh
he
heaved
a
brobdingnagian
sigh
of
relief
when
they
finished
well
he
exclaimed
that
that
at
last
i
know
where
i
going
you
certainly
saved
my
life
i
know
where
all
the
buildings
are
so
it
ought
to
be
easy
sure
said
carl
encouragingly
it
easy
now
there
nothing
to
do
till
until
eight
when
we
attend
chapel
to
the
glory
of
the
lord
i
think
i
pray
i
may
need
it
christ
i
hate
to
study
me
too
hugh
lied
he
really
loved
books
but
somehow
he
admit
the
fact
which
had
suddenly
become
shameful
to
carl
let
go
to
the
movies
he
suggested
changing
the
subject
for
safety
carl
put
on
his
freshman
cap
and
flung
hugh
to
him
gloria
nielsen
is
there
and
she
a
pash
baby
ought
to
be
a
good
fillum
the
blue
and
orange
it
was
the
only
movie
theater
in
town
was
almost
full
when
the
boys
arrived
only
a
few
seats
near
the
front
were
still
vacant
a
freshman
started
down
the
aisle
his
baby
bonnet
stuck
jauntily
on
the
back
of
his
head
freshman
kill
him
murder
the
frosh
shouts
came
from
all
parts
of
the
house
and
an
instant
later
hundreds
of
peanuts
shot
swiftly
at
the
startled
freshman
cap
cap
cap
off
there
was
a
panic
of
excitement
were
standing
on
their
chairs
to
get
free
throwing
room
the
freshman
snatched
off
his
cap
drew
his
head
like
a
scared
turtle
down
into
his
coat
collar
and
ran
for
a
seat
hugh
and
carl
tucked
their
caps
into
their
coat
pockets
and
attempted
to
stroll
nonchalantly
down
the
aisle
they
had
taken
three
steps
before
the
bombardment
began
like
their
classmate
they
ran
for
safety
then
some
one
in
the
front
of
the
theatre
threw
a
peanut
at
some
one
in
the
rear
the
fight
was
on
yelling
like
madmen
the
students
stood
on
their
chairs
and
hurled
peanuts
the
front
and
rear
of
the
house
automatically
dividing
into
enemy
camps
when
the
fight
was
at
its
hottest
three
girls
entered
wimmen
wimmen
as
the
girls
walked
down
the
aisle
infinitely
pleased
with
their
reception
five
hundred
men
stamped
in
time
with
their
steps
no
sooner
were
the
girls
seated
than
there
was
a
scramble
in
one
corner
an
excited
scuffling
of
feet
i
got
it
a
boy
screamed
he
stood
on
his
chair
and
held
up
a
live
mouse
by
its
tail
there
was
a
shout
of
applause
and
then
play
catch
the
boy
dropped
the
writhing
mouse
into
a
peanut
bag
screwed
the
open
end
and
then
threw
the
bag
far
across
the
room
another
boy
caught
it
and
threw
it
this
time
over
the
girls
heads
they
screamed
and
jumped
upon
their
chairs
holding
their
skirts
and
dancing
up
and
down
in
assumed
terror
back
over
their
heads
back
and
over
again
and
again
the
bagged
mouse
was
thrown
while
the
girls
screamed
and
the
boys
roared
with
delight
suddenly
one
of
the
girls
threw
up
her
arm
caught
the
bag
deftly
held
it
for
a
second
and
then
tossed
it
into
the
rear
of
the
theater
cheers
of
terrifying
violence
broke
loose
ray
ray
atta
girl
hot
dog
ray
ray
and
then
the
lights
went
out
moosick
moosick
the
audience
stamped
and
roared
whistled
and
howled
moosick
we
want
moosick
the
pianist
an
undergraduate
calmly
strolled
down
the
aisle
get
a
move
on
earn
your
salary
give
us
moosick
the
pianist
paused
to
thumb
his
nose
casually
at
the
entire
audience
and
then
amid
shouts
and
hisses
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
began
to
play
love
nest
immediately
the
boys
began
to
whistle
and
as
the
comedy
was
utterly
stupid
they
relieved
their
boredom
by
whistling
the
various
tunes
that
the
pianist
played
until
the
miserable
film
flickered
out
then
the
feature
and
the
fun
began
during
the
stretches
of
pure
narrative
the
boys
whistled
but
when
there
was
any
real
action
they
talked
the
picture
was
a
melodrama
of
love
and
hate
as
the
advertisement
said
the
boys
told
the
actors
what
to
do
they
revealed
to
them
the
secrets
of
the
plot
she
hiding
behind
the
door
harold
no
no
not
that
way
hey
dumbbell
behind
the
catch
him
gloria
he
only

no
that
not
him
the
climactic
fight
brought
shouts
of
encouragement
to
the
villain
kill

to
his
kidneys
ahhhhh
as
the
villain
hit
the
hero
in
the
stomach
muss
his
hair
attaboy
kill
the
skunk
and
finally
groans
of
despair
when
the
hero
won
his
inevitable
victory
but
it
was
the
love
scenes
that
aroused
the
greatest
ardor
and
joy
the
hero
was
given
careful
instructions
some
neckin
harold

ahhh

harold

getting

she
vamping

stop

gloria
he
a
good
boy
and
so
on
until
the
picture
ended
in
the
usual
of
the
hero
and
heroine
silhouetted
in
a
tender
embrace
against
the
setting
sun
the
boys
breathed
ahhhh
and
ooooh
ecstatically
and
laughed
the
meretricious
melodrama
did
not
fool
them
but
they
delighted
in
its
absurdities
the
lights
flashed
on
and
the
crowd
filed
out
about
the
picture
and
commenting
favorably
on
the
heroine
figure
there
were
shouts
to
this
fellow
or
that
fellow
to
come
on
over
and
play
bridge
and
suggestions
here
and
there
to
go
to
a
drug
store
and
get
a
drink
hugh
and
carl
strolled
home
over
the
dark
campus
both
of
them
radiant
with
excitement
hugh
frankly
so
golly
i
did
enjoy
that
he
exclaimed
i
never
had
a
better
time
it
was
sure
hot
stuff

shoulders
until

ears

his
coat
collar
gettin
cold
fall
here
nope
not
the
harem
my
old
lady
hugh
looked
at
him
bewildered
he
was
finding
carl
more
and
more
a
conundrum
he
consistently
called
his
mother
his
old
lady
insisted
that
she
was
a
damned
nuisance
and
wrote
to
her
every
night
hugh
was
writing
to
his
mother
only
twice
a
week
it
was
very
confusing
chapter
v
capwell
chapel
it
bore
the
pork
merchant
name
as
an
eternal
memorial
to
him
was
as
impressive
inside
as
out
the
windows
had
been
made
by
a
famous
new
york
firm
the
altar
had
been
designed
by
an
even
more
famous
sculptor
the
walls
quite
improperly
were
adorned
with
paintings
of
former
presidents
but
the
largest
painting
of
all
it
was
fairly
gargantuan
was
of
the
pork
merchant
a
large
ruddy
gentleman
whom
the
artist
a
keen
observer
had
painted
truly
complacently
porcine
benevolently
smug
the
seniors
and
juniors
sat
in
the
nave
the
sophomores
on
the
right
side
of
the
transept
the
freshmen
on
the
left
hugh
gazed
upward
in
awe
at
the
dim
recesses
of
the
vaulted
ceiling
at
the
ornately
carved
choir
where
gowned
students
were
quietly
seating
themselves
at
the
colored
light
streaming
through
the
beautiful
windows
at
the
picture
of
the
pork
merchant
the
chapel
bells
ceased
tolling
rich
solemn
tones
swelled
from
the
organ
president
culver
in
cap
and
gown
his
purple
hood
falling
over
his
shoulders
entered
followed
by
his
faculty
also
gowned
and
hooded
the
students
rose
and
remained
standing
until
the
president
and
faculty
were
seated
the
organ
sounded
a
final
chord
and
then
the
college
chaplain
rose
and
prayed
very
badly
he
implored
the
lord
to
look
kindly
on
these
young
men
who
have
come
from
near
and
far
to
drink
from
this
great
fount
of
learning
this
well
of
wisdom
the
prayer
over
the
president
addressed
the
students
he
was
a
large
erect
man
with
hair
and
a
rugged
intelligent
face
although
he
was
sixty
years
old
his
body
was
vigorous
and
free
from
extra
weight
he
spoke
slowly
and
impressively
choosing
his
words
with
care
and
enunciating
them
with
great
distinctness
his
address
was
for
the
freshmen
he
welcomed
them
to
sanford
college
to
its
splendid
traditions
its
high
ideals
its
noble
history
he
spoke
of
the
famous
men
it
numbered
among
its
sons
of
the
work
they
had
done
for
america
and
the
world
of
the
work
he
hoped
future
sanford
men
they
the
freshmen
would
some
day
do
for
america
and
the
world
he
mentioned
briefly
the
boys
from
sanford
who
had
died
in
the
world
war
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
and
he
prayed
that
their
sacrifice
had
not
been
in
vain
finally
he
spoke
of
the
chapel
service
which
the
students
were
required
to
attend
he
hoped
that
they
would
find
inspiration
in
it
knowledge
and
strength
he
assured
them
that
the
service
would
always
be
nonsectarian
that
there
would
never
be
anything
in
it
to
offend
any
one
of
any
race
creed
or
religion
with
a
last
exhortation
to
the
freshmen
to
make
the
most
of
their
great
opportunities
he
ended
with
the
announcement
that
they
would
rise
and
sing
the
hymn
hugh
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
speech
but
disturbed
by
the
students
from
where
he
sat
he
got
an
excellent
view
of
the
juniors
and
seniors
the
seniors
who
sat
in
the
front
of
the
nave
seemed
to
be
paying
fairly
good
attention
but
the
juniors
many
of
them
at
least
paid
no
attention
at
all
some
of
them
were
munching
apples
some
doughnuts
and
many
of
them
were
reading
the
sanford
news
the
college
daily
paper
some
of
the
juniors
talked
during
the
president
address
and
once
he
noticed
four
of
them
doubled
up
as
if
overcome
by
laughter
to
him
the
service
was
a
beautiful
and
impressive
occasion
he
could
not
understand
the
conduct
of
the
it
seemed
to
put
it
mildly
irreverent
every
one
however
sang
the
doxology
with
great
vigor
some
of
the
boys
lifting
up
a
whisky
tenor
that
made
the
chapel
ring
and
to
which
hugh
happily
added
his
own
clear
tenor
the
benediction
was
pronounced
by
the
chaplain
the
seniors
marched
out
slowly
in
twos
while
the
other
students
and
the
faculty
stood
in
their
places
then
the
president
followed
by
the
faculty
passed
out
of
the
great
doors
when
the
back
of
the
last
faculty
gown
had
disappeared
the
broke
for
the
door
pushing
each
other
aside
swearing
when
a
toe
was
stepped
on
yelling
to
each
other
some
of
them
joyously
chanting
the
doxology
hugh
was
caught
in
the
rush
and
carried
along
with
the
mob
feeling
ashamed
and
distressed
this
was
no
way
to
leave
a
church
once
outside
however
he
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
chapel
service
he
had
five
minutes
in
which
to
get
to
his
first
class
and
the
building
was
across
the
campus
a
good
two
minutes
walk
he
patted
his
cap
to
be
sure
that
it
was
firmly
on
the
back
of
his
head
clutched
his
and
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
go
the
strolling
whom
he
passed
at
top
speed
grinning
after
him
in
tolerant
amusement
hugh
was
the
first
one
in
the
and
wondered
in
a
moment
of
panic
if
he
was
in
the
right
place
he
sat
down
dubiously
and
looked
at
his
watch
four
minutes
left
he
would
wait
two
and
then
if
nobody
came
he
would
he
gasped
he
could
imagine
what
he
would
do
how
could
he
find
the
right
maybe
his
class
did
come
at
this
hour
at
all
suppose
he
and
carl
had
made
a
mistake
if
they
had
his
whole
schedule
was
probably
wrong
oh
golly
he
thought
feeling
pitifully
weak
wo
that
be
hell
what
can
i
do
at
that
moment
a
youth
entered
looking
as
scared
as
hugh
felt
his
face
was
pale
and
his
voice
trembled
as
he
asked
timidly
do
you
know
if
this
is
section
three
of
math
one
hugh
was
immediately
strengthened
i
think
so
he
replied
anyhow
let
wait
and
find
out
the
freshman
sighed
in
huge
relief
took
out
a
not
too
clean
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
face
criminy
he
exclaimed
as
he
wriggled
down
the
aisle
to
a
seat
by
hugh
i
was
sure
worried
i
thought
i
was
in
the
wrong
building
though
i
was
sure
that
my
adviser
had
told
me
positively
that
math
was
in
matthew
six
i
guess
we
all
right
hugh
comforted
him
as
two
other
freshmen
also
looking
dubious
entered
they
were
followed
by
four
more
and
then
by
a
stampeding
group
all
of
them
all
of
them
in
a
rush
in
the
next
minute
five
freshmen
dashed
in
and
then
dashed
out
again
utterly
bewildered
obviously
terrified
and
not
knowing
where
to
go
or
what
to
do
is
this
math
one
section
three
every
man
demanded
of
the
room
as
he
entered
and
every
one
yelled
yes
or
i
think
so
just
as
the
bell
rang
at
ten
minutes
after
the
hour
the
instructor
entered
it
was
professor
kane
this
is
mathematics
one
section
three
kane
announced
in
a
dry
voice
if
there
is
any
one
here
who
does
not
belong
here
he
will
please
leave
nobody
moved
so
he
shuffled
some
cards
in
his
hand
and
asked
the
men
to
answer
to
the
adams
present
sir
kane
looked
up
and
frowned
say
he
said
severely
this
is
not
a
yes
sir
stuttered
adams
his
face
first
white
then
purple
here
sir
will
do
there
is
no
need
of
the
allsop
here
in
a
very
faint
voice
speak
up
here
this
time
a
little
louder
and
so
it
went
hardly
a
man
escaping
without
some
admonishment
throat
went
dry
his
tongue
literally
stuck
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
was
sure
that
he
would
be
able
to
say
here
when
it
came
his
turn
and
he
could
feel
his
heart
pounding
in
dreadful
anticipation
carver
here
there
it
was
out
or
had
he
really
said
it
he
looked
at
the
professor
in
terror
but
kane
was
already
calling
dana
hugh
sank
back
in
his
chair
he
was
trembling
kane
announced
the
and
when
hugh
caught
the
word
trigonometry
he
actually
thrilled
with
joy
he
had
had
trig
in
high
school
whoops
would
he
hit
math
i
in
the
eye
he
knock
it
for
a
goal
then
conscience
spoke
ought
he
to
tell
kane
that
he
had
already
had
trig
he
guessed
quite
rightly
that
kane
had
not
understood
his
credentials
which
had
given
him
credit
for
advanced
mathematics
kane
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
that
was
advanced
algebra
hugh
felt
that
he
ought
to
explain
the
mistake
but
fear
of
the
arid
impersonal
man
restrained
him
kane
had
told
him
to
take
math
i
and
kane
was
law
unlike
most
of
hugh
instructors
kane
kept
the
class
the
full
hour
the
first
day
seating
them
in
alphabetical
order
he
had
to
repeat
the
performance
three
times
during
the
week
as
new
men
entered
the
class
lecturing
them
on
the
need
of
doing
their
problems
carefully
and
accurately
and
discoursing
on
the
value
of
mathematics
trigonometry
in
particular
in
the
study
of
science
and
engineering
hugh
was
not
interested
in
science
engineering
or
mathematics
but
he
listened
carefully
trying
hard
to
follow
kane
cold
discourse
at
the
end
of
the
hour
he
told
his
neighbor
as
they
left
the
room
that
he
guessed
that
professor
kane
knew
an
awful
lot
and
his
neighbor
agreed
with
him
hugh
other
instructors
proved
less
impressive
than
kane
in
fact
alling
the
instructor
in
latin
was
altogether
disconcerting
plautus
he
told
the
class
wrote
comedies
farces
not
exercises
in
translation
he
was
also
my
innocents
occasionally
naughty
oh
really
naughty
what
worse
he
used
slang
common
slang
the
kind
of
stuff
that
you
and
i
talk
now
i
have
an
excellent
vocabulary
of
slang
obscenity
and
profanity
and
you
are
going
to
hear
most
of
it
think
of
the
opportunity
do
think
that
i
mean
just
and
they
are
good
for
a
laugh
in
a
theater
any
day
but
plautus
was
not
restrained
by
our
modern
conventions
will
confine
yourselves
please
to
english
undefiled
but
i
shall
speak
the
modern
equivalent
to
a
roman
language
whenever
necessary
you
will
find
this
course
very
illuminating
in
some
ways
and
who
knows
you
may
learn
something
not
only
about
latin
but
about
rome
hugh
thought
alling
was
rather
flippant
and
lacking
in
dignity
professor
kane
was
more
like
a
college
teacher
before
the
term
was
out
he
hated
kane
with
an
intensity
that
astonished
him
and
he
looked
forward
to
his
latin
classes
with
an
eagerness
of
which
he
was
almost
ashamed
plautus
in
the
alling
free
and
colloquial
translations
was
enormously
funny
professor
hartley
who
gave
the
history
lectures
talked
in
a
bass
monotone
and
never
seemed
to
pause
for
breath
his
words
came
in
a
slow
steady
stream
that
never
rose
nor
fell
nor
paused
until
the
bell
rang
the
men
in
the
back
of
the
room
slept
hugh
was
seated
near
the
front
so
he
drew
pictures
in
his
the
english
instructor
talked
about
punctuation
as
if
it
were
very
unpleasant
but
almost
religiously
important
and
what
the
various
lecturers
in
general
science
talked
about
ten
men
gave
the
course
hugh
never
knew
in
after
years
all
that
he
could
remember
about
the
course
was
that
one
man
spoke
broken
english
and
that
a
professor
of
physics
had
made
huge
bulbs
glow
with
marvelous
colors
hugh
had
one
terrifying
experience
before
he
finally
got
settled
to
his
work
it
occurred
the
second
day
of
classes
he
was
comfortably
seated
in
what
he
thought
was
his
english
class
he
had
come
in
just
as
the
bell
rang
when
the
instructor
announced
that
it
was
a
class
in
french
what
was
he
to
do
what
would
the
instructor
do
if
he
got
up
and
left
the
room
what
would
happen
if
he
did
report
at
his
english
class
what
would
happen
to
him
for
coming
into
his
english
class
late
these
questions
staggered
his
mind
he
was
afraid
to
stay
in
the
french
class
cautiously
he
got
up
and
began
to
tiptoe
to
the
door
wrong
room
the
instructor
asked
pleasantly
hugh
flushed
yes
sir
he
stopped
dead
still
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
he
was
a
typical
rattled
freshman
and
the
class
which
was
composed
of
sophomores
laughed
hugh
angry
and
humiliated
started
for
the
door
but
the
instructor
held
up
a
hand
that
silenced
the
class
then
he
motioned
for
hugh
to
come
to
his
desk
what
class
are
you
looking
for
english
one
sir
section
seven
he
held
out
his
schedule
card
reassured
by
the
instructor
kindly
manner
the
instructor
looked
at
the
card
and
then
consulted
a
printed
schedule
oh
he
said
your
adviser
made
a
mistake
he
got
you
into
the
wrong
group
list
you
belong
in
sanders
six
thank
you
sir
hugh
spoke
so
softly
that
the
waiting
class
did
not
hear
him
but
the
instructor
smiled
at
the
intensity
of
his
thanks
as
he
left
the
room
he
knew
that
every
one
was
looking
at
him
his
legs
felt
as
if
they
were
made
of
wood
it
was
until
he
had
closed
the
door
that
his
worked
naturally
but
the
worst
was
still
ahead
of
him
he
had
to
go
to
his
english
class
in
sanders
he
ran
across
the
campus
his
heart
beating
wildly
his
hands
desperately
clenched
when
he
reached
sanders
he
found
three
other
freshmen
grouped
before
the
door
is
this
english
one
section
seven
one
asked
tremulously
i
think
so
whispered
the
second
do
you
know
he
asked
turning
to
hugh
yes
i
am
almost
sure
they
stood
there
looking
at
each
other
no
one
quite
daring
to
enter
sanders
no
one
quite
daring
to
leave
suddenly
the
front
door
of
the
building
slammed
a
bareheaded
youth
rushed
up
the
stairs
he
was
a
repeater
that
is
a
man
who
had
failed
the
course
the
preceding
year
and
was
taking
it
over
again
he
brushed
by
the
scared
freshmen
opened
the
door
and
strode
into
sanders
closing
the
door
behind
him
the
freshmen
looked
at
each
other
and
then
the
one
nearest
the
door
opened
it
the
four
of
them
filed
in
silently
the
class
looked
up
sit
in
the
back
of
the
room
said
the
instructor
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
that
in
his
senior
year
hugh
remembered
the
incident
and
wondered
at
his
terror
he
tried
to
remember
why
he
had
been
so
badly
frightened
he
could
there
did
seem
to
be
any
reason
at
all
chapter
vi
about
a
week
after
the
opening
of
college
hugh
returned
to
surrey
hall
one
night
feeling
unusually
virtuous
and
happy
he
had
worked
religiously
at
the
library
until
it
had
closed
at
ten
and
he
had
been
in
the
mood
to
study
his
lessons
for
the
next
day
were
all
prepared
and
prepared
well
he
had
strolled
across
the
campus
buoyant
and
happy
some
one
was
playing
the
organ
in
the
dark
chapel
he
paused
to
listen
two
students
passed
him
humming
softly
sanford
sanford
mother
of
men
love
us
guard
us
hold
us
true
the
dormitories
were
dim
masses
broken
by
rectangles
of
soft
yellow
light
somewhere
a
banjo
twanged
another
student
passed
hello
carver
he
said
pleasantly
nice
night
oh
hello
jones
it
sure
is
the
simple
greeting
completed
his
happiness
he
felt
that
he
belonged
that
sanford
the
mother
of
men
had
taken
him
to
her
heart
the
music
in
the
chapel
swelled
lyric
passionate
up
up
almost
a
cry
the
moonlight
was
golden
between
the
heavy
shadows
of
the
elms
tears
came
into
the
boy
eyes
he
was
melancholy
with
joy
he
climbed
the
stairs
of
surrey
slowly
reluctant
to
reach
his
room
and
carl
flippancy
he
passed
an
open
door
and
glanced
at
the
men
inside
the
room
hi
hugh
come
in
and
bull
a
while
not
thanks
he
moved
on
down
the
hall
feeling
a
vague
resentment
his
mood
had
been
broken
shattered
the
door
opposite
his
own
room
was
slightly
open
a
freshman
lived
there
herbert
morse
a
queer
chap
with
whom
carl
and
hugh
had
succeeded
in
scraping
up
only
the
slightest
acquaintance
he
was
a
big
fellow
fully
six
feet
husky
and
quick
the
football
coach
said
that
he
had
the
makings
of
a
great
but
he
had
already
been
fired
off
the
squad
because
of
his
irregularity
in
reporting
for
practice
except
for
what
the
boys
called
his
some
of
them
said
that
he
was
too
damned
he
was
extremely
attractive
he
had
red
almost
hair
and
an
exquisite
skin
as
delicate
as
a
child
his
features
were
well
carved
his
nose
slightly
aquiline
a
magnificent
looking
fellow
almost
imperious
or
as
hugh
once
said
to
carl
morse
looks
kinda
noble
as
hugh
placed
his
hand
on
the
of
no
he
heard
something
that
sounded
suspiciously
like
a
sob
from
across
the
hall
he
paused
and
listened
he
was
sure
that
he
could
hear
some
one
crying
wonder
what
wrong
he
thought
instantly
disturbed
and
sympathetic
he
crossed
the
hall
and
tapped
lightly
on
morse
door
there
was
no
answer
nor
was
there
any
when
he
tapped
a
second
time
for
a
moment
he
was
abashed
and
then
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
morse
room
in
the
far
corner
morse
was
sitting
at
his
desk
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
his
shoulders
shaking
he
was
crying
fiercely
terribly
at
times
his
whole
body
jerked
in
the
violence
of
his
sobbing
hugh
stood
by
the
door
embarrassed
and
rather
frightened
morse
grief
brought
a
lump
to
his
throat
he
had
never
seen
any
one
cry
like
that
before
something
had
to
be
done
but
what
could
he
do
he
had
no
right
to
intrude
on
morse
but
he
could
let
the
poor
fellow
go
on
suffering
like
that
as
he
stood
there
hesitant
shaken
morse
buried
his
head
deeper
in
his
arms
moaned
convulsively
twisting
and
trembling
after
a
series
of
sobs
that
seemed
to
tear
themselves
from
him
that
was
too
much
for
hugh
he
could
stand
it
some
force
outside
of
him
sent
him
across
the
room
to
morse
he
put
his
hand
on
a
quivering
shoulder
and
said
gently
what
is
it
morse
what
the
matter
morse
ran
his
hand
despairingly
through
his
red
hair
shook
his
head
and
made
no
answer
come
on
old
man
buck
up
hugh
voice
trembled
it
was
husky
with
sympathy
tell
me
about
it
maybe
i
can
help
then
morse
looked
up
his
face
stained
with
tears
his
eyes
inflamed
almost
desperate
he
stared
at
hugh
wonderingly
for
an
instant
he
was
angry
at
the
intrusion
but
his
anger
passed
at
once
he
could
not
miss
the
tenderness
and
sympathy
in
hugh
face
and
the
boy
hand
was
still
pressing
with
friendly
insistence
on
his
shoulder
there
was
something
so
boyishly
frank
so
clean
and
honest
about
hugh
that
his
irritation
melted
into
confidence
and
he
craved
a
confidant
passionately
shut
the
door
he
said
dully
and
reached
into
his
trousers
pocket
for
his
handkerchief
he
mopped
his
face
and
eyes
vigorously
while
hugh
was
closing
the
door
and
then
blew
his
nose
as
if
he
hated
it
but
the
tears
continued
to
come
and
all
during
his
talk
with
hugh
he
had
to
pause
occasionally
to
dry
his
eyes
hugh
stood
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
rug
not
knowing
whether
to
sit
down
or
not
morse
was
clutching
his
handkerchief
in
his
hand
and
staring
at
the
floor
finally
he
spoke
up
sit
down
he
said
in
a
dead
voice
there
hugh
sank
into
the
chair
morse
indicated
and
then
gripped
his
hands
together
he
felt
weak
and
frightened
and
absolutely
unable
to
say
anything
but
morse
saved
him
the
trouble
i
suppose
you
think
i
am
an
awful
baby
he
began
his
voice
thick
with
tears
but
i
just
ca
help
it
i
i
just
ca
help
it
i
do
want
to
cry
but
i
do
and
then
he
added
defiantly
go
ahead
and
think
a
baby
if
you
want
to
i
do
think
you
a
baby
hugh
said
softly
i
just
sorry
all
i
hope
i
can
help
he
smiled
shyly
hopefully
his
smile
conquered
morse
you
a
good
kid
carver
he
cried
impulsively
a
darn
good
kid
i
like
you
and
i
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
and
i
i
i
wo
care
if
you
laugh
i
wo
laugh
hugh
promised
relieved
to
think
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
laughing
the
trouble
could
be
so
awfully
bad
morse
blew
his
nose
stuck
his
handkerchief
into
his
pocket
pulled
it
out
again
and
dabbed
his
eyes
returned
it
to
his
pocket
and
suddenly
stood
up
i
homesick
he
blurred
out
i
i
homesick
damned
homesick
i
been
homesick
ever
since
i
arrived
i
i
just
ca
stand
it
for
an
instant
hugh
did
have
a
wild
desire
to
laugh
part
of
the
desire
was
caused
by
nervous
relief
but
part
of
it
was
caused
by
what
seemed
to
him
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
a
big
fellow
like
morse
blubbering
bawling
for
home
and
mother
you
ca
know
morse
went
on
how
awful
it
is
awful
i
want
to
cry
all
the
time
i
ca
listen
in
classes
a
prof
asked
me
a
question
and
i
did
know
what
he
had
been
talking
about
he
asked
me
what
he
had
said
i
had
to
say
i
did
know
the
whole
class
laughed
and
the
prof
asked
me
why
i
had
come
to
college
god
i
nearly
died
hugh
sympathy
was
all
captured
again
he
knew
that
he
die
if
he
ever
made
a
fool
of
himself
in
the
gosh
he
exclaimed
what
did
you
say
nothing
i
could
think
of
anything
for
a
minute
i
thought
that
my
head
was
going
to
bust
he
quit
razzing
me
and
i
tried
to
pay
attention
but
i
could
all
i
could
do
was
think
of
home
lord
i
wish
i
was
there
he
mopped
at
his
eyes
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
nervously
oh
you
get
over
that
hugh
said
comfortingly
pretty
soon
get
to
know
lots
of
fellows
and
then
you
wo
mind
about
home
that
what
i
keep
telling
myself
but
it
do
work
i
ca
eat
or
sleep
i
ca
study
i
ca
do
anything
i
tell
you
i
got
to
go
home
i
to
this
last
with
desperate
emphasis
hugh
smiled
you
all
wrong
he
asserted
positively
you
just
lonely
that
all
i
bet
that
you
be
crazy
about
college
in
a
month
same
as
the
rest
of
us
when
you
feel
blue
come
in
and
see
peters
and
me
we
make
you
grin
peters
will
anyway
you
ca
be
blue
around
him
morse
sat
down
you
do
understand
i
not
lonely
it
is
that
i
could
talk
to
fellows
all
day
long
if
i
wanted
to
i
do
want
to
talk
to
i
ca
there
just
one
person
that
i
want
to
talk
to
and
that
my
mother
he
shot
the
word
mother
out
defiantly
and
glared
at
hugh
silently
daring
him
to
laugh
which
hugh
had
sense
enough
not
to
do
although
he
wanted
to
strongly
the
great
big
baby
wanting
his
mother
why
he
wanted
his
mother
too
but
he
did
cry
about
it
that
all
right
he
said
reassuringly
you
see
her
christmas
vacation
and
that
is
very
long
off
i
want
to
see
her
now
morse
jumped
to
his
feet
and
raised
his
clenched
hands
above
his
head
now
he
roared
now
i
got
to
going
home
on
the
midnight
he
whirled
about
to
his
desk
and
began
to
pull
open
the
drawers
piling
their
contents
on
the
top
here
hugh
rushed
to
him
and
clutched
his
arms
do
do
that
morse
struggled
angry
at
the
restraining
hands
ready
to
strike
them
off
hugh
had
a
flash
of
inspiration
think
how
disappointed
your
mother
will
be
he
cried
hanging
on
to
morse
arms
think
of
her
morse
ceased
struggling
she
will
be
disappointed
he
admitted
miserably
what
can
i
do
there
was
a
world
of
despair
in
his
question
hugh
pushed
him
into
the
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
i
tell
you
he
said
he
talked
for
half
an
hour
cheering
morse
assuring
him
that
his
homesickness
would
pass
away
offering
to
study
with
him
at
first
morse
paid
little
attention
but
finally
he
quit
sniffing
and
looked
up
real
interest
in
his
face
when
hugh
got
a
weak
smile
out
of
him
he
felt
that
his
work
had
been
done
he
jumped
off
the
desk
leaned
over
to
slap
morse
on
the
back
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
good
egg
but
a
damn
fool
morse
grinned
you
a
good
egg
yourself
he
said
gratefully
saved
my
life
hugh
was
pleased
and
blushed
you
full
of
bull
remember
we
do
latin
at
ten
he
opened
the
door
good
night
good
night
and
hugh
heard
as
he
closed
the
door
thanks
a
lot
when
he
opened
his
own
door
he
found
carl
sitting
before
a
blazing
log
fire
there
was
no
other
light
in
the
room
carl
had
written
his
nightly
letter
to
the
old
lady
and
he
was
a
little
homesick
himself
softened
into
a
tender
and
pensive
mood
he
did
not
move
as
hugh
sat
down
in
a
big
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
and
said
softly
thinking
where
you
been
across
the
hall
in
morse
room
then
as
carl
looked
up
in
surprise
he
told
him
of
his
experience
with
their
neighbor
he
get
over
it
he
concluded
confidently
he
just
been
lonely
carl
puffed
contemplatively
at
his
pipe
for
a
few
minutes
before
replying
hugh
waited
watching
the
slender
boy
stretched
out
in
a
big
chair
before
the
fire
his
ankles
crossed
his
face
gentle
and
boyish
in
the
ruddy
flickering
light
the
shadows
heavy
and
wavering
played
magic
with
the
room
it
was
vast
mysterious
no
said
carl
pausing
again
to
puff
his
pipe
no
he
wo
get
over
it
he
go
home
aw
shucks
a
big
guy
like
that
is
going
to
stay
a
baby
all
his
life
hugh
was
frankly
derisive
soon
as
he
gets
to
know
a
lot
of
fellows
he
forget
home
and
mother
carl
smiled
vaguely
his
eyes
dreamy
as
he
gazed
into
the
hypnotizing
flames
the
mask
of
sophistication
had
slipped
off
his
face
he
was
pleasantly
in
the
control
of
a
gentle
mood
a
mood
that
erased
the
last
vestige
of
protective
coloring
he
shook
his
head
slowly
you
do
understand
hugh
morse
is
sick
not
lonesome
he
got
something
worse
than
flu
nobody
can
stand
what
he
got
hugh
looked
at
him
in
bewilderment
this
was
a
new
carl
some
one
he
had
met
before
gone
was
the
slang
flippancy
the
hard
roughness
even
his
voice
was
softened
carl
knocked
his
pipe
empty
on
the
knob
of
an
andiron
sank
deeper
into
his
chair
and
began
to
speak
slowly
i
think
i
going
to
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
about
myself
we
got
to
room
together
and
i
well
i
like
you
you
a
good
egg
but
you
get
me
at
all
i
guess
you
never
run
up
against
anybody
like
me
before
he
paused
hugh
said
nothing
afraid
to
break
into
carl
mood
he
was
intensely
curious
he
leaned
forward
and
watched
carl
who
was
staring
dreamily
into
the
fire
i
told
you
once
i
think
he
continued
that
my
old
man
had
left
us
a
lot
of
jack
that
true
we
rich
awfully
rich
i
have
my
own
account
and
can
spend
as
much
as
i
like
the
sky
the
limit
what
i
did
tell
you
is
that
we
no
class
at
all
my
old
man
made
all
his
money
the
first
year
of
the
war
he
was
a
a
middleman
money
just
rolled
in
i
guess
he
bought
stocks
with
it
and
they
boomed
and
he
had
sense
enough
to
sell
them
when
they
were
at
the
top
six
years
ago
we
did
have
hardly
anything
now
we
rich
my
old
man
was
a
good
scout
but
he
did
have
much
education
neither
has
the
old
lady
both
of
went
through
that
all
well
they
knew
they
were
real
folks
not
regular
people
and
they
wanted
me
to
be
see
that
why
they
sent
me
to
kane
well
kane
strong
for
kids
not
by
a
damn
sight
at
first
old
simmonds
he
the
head
master
would
take
me
said
that
he
have
room
but
my
old
man
begged
and
begged
so
finally
simmonds
said
all
right
again
he
paused
and
hugh
waited
carl
was
speaking
so
softly
that
he
had
trouble
in
hearing
him
but
somehow
he
did
dare
to
ask
him
to
speak
louder
i
forget
the
day
carl
went
on
that
the
old
man
left
me
at
kane
i
was
scared
and
i
did
want
to
stay
but
he
made
me
he
said
that
kane
would
make
a
gentleman
out
of
me
i
was
homesick
homesick
as
hell
i
know
how
morse
feels
i
tried
to
run
away
three
times
but
they
caught
me
and
brought
me
back
cry
i
bawled
all
the
time
when
i
was
alone
i
could
sleep
for
weeks
i
just
laid
in
bed
and
bawled
god
it
was
awful
the
worst
of
it
was
the
meals
i
did
know
how
to
eat
right
you
see
and
the
master
who
sat
at
the
table
with
our
form
would
correct
me
i
used
to
want
to
die
and
sometimes
i
would
say
that
i
was
sick
and
did
want
any
food
so
that
i
would
have
to
go
to
meals
the
fellows
razzed
the
life
out
of
me
some
of
called
me
paddy
the
reason
i
came
here
to
sanford
was
that
no
kane
fellows
come
here
they
go
mostly
to
williams
but
some
of
go
to
yale
or
princeton
well
i
had
four
years
of
that
and
i
was
homesick
the
whole
four
years
oh
i
do
mean
that
they
kept
after
me
all
the
time
that
was
just
the
first
few
months
but
they
never
really
accepted
me
i
never
felt
at
home
even
when
i
was
with
a
bunch
of
them
i
felt
lonesome
and
they
never
made
a
gentleman
out
of
me
though
my
old
lady
thinks
they
did
you
crazy
hugh
interrupted
indignantly
you
as
much
a
gentleman
as
anybody
in
college
carl
smiled
and
shook
his
head
no
you
do
understand
you
a
gentleman
but
i
not
oh
i
know
all
the
tricks
the
parlor
stunts
four
years
at
kane
taught
me
those
but
they
just
tricks
to
me
i
do
know
just
how
to
explain
it
but
i
know
that
you
a
gentleman
and
i
not
you
just
plain
you
make
me
feel
like
a
fish
why
just
from
a
country
high
school
i
not
in
your
class
hugh
sat
up
and
leaned
eagerly
toward
carl
gesticulating
excitedly
as
if
that
made
any
difference
carl
replied
his
voice
sharp
with
scorn
you
see
i
a
bad
egg
i
drink
and
gamble
and
pet
i
gone
the
limit
yet
on
on
account
of
my
old
lady
but
i
will
hugh
was
relieved
he
had
wondered
more
than
once
during
the
past
week
just
how
far
carl
had
gone
several
times
carl
had
suggested
by
sly
innuendos
that
there
was
anything
that
he
had
done
and
hugh
had
felt
a
slight
disapproval
and
considerable
envy
his
own
standards
were
very
high
very
strict
but
he
was
ashamed
to
reveal
them
i
never
gone
the
limit
either
he
confessed
shyly
carl
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
you
poor
fish
do
you
suppose
i
know
that
he
exclaimed
how
did
you
know
hugh
demanded
indignantly
i
might
why
i
was
out
with
a
girl
just
before
i
left
home
and
you
kissed
her
carl
concluded
for
him
i
do
know
how
i
knew
but
i
did
you
just
kinda
pure
that
all
i
not
pure
at
all
i
just
a
little
afraid
and
i
keep
thinkin
of
my
old
lady
i
started
to
several
times
but
i
always
thought
of
her
and
quit
he
sat
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
continued
more
gently
my
old
lady
never
came
to
kane
she
never
will
come
here
either
she
wants
to
give
me
a
real
chance
see
she
knows
she
is
a
lady
but
but
oh
god
hugh
she
white
white
as
hell
i
guess
i
think
more
of
her
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
that
why
i
write
to
her
every
night
she
writes
to
me
every
day
too
the
letters
have
mistakes
in
them
but
but
they
keep
me
straight
that
is
they
have
so
far
i
know
though
that
some
night
i
be
out
with
a
bag
and
get
too
much
liquor
in
me
and
then
virginity
you
crazy
carl
you
know
you
wo
carl
rose
from
the
chair
and
stretched
hugely
you
a
good
egg
hugh
he
said
in
the
midst
of
a
yawn
but
you
a
damn
fool
hugh
started
that
was
just
what
he
had
said
to
morse
he
never
caught
carl
in
a
confidential
mood
again
the
next
morning
he
was
his
old
flippant
self
swearing
because
he
had
to
study
his
latin
which
was
of
any
damned
use
to
anybody
in
the
following
weeks
hugh
religiously
clung
to
morse
helped
him
with
his
work
went
to
the
movies
with
him
inveigled
him
into
going
on
several
long
walks
morse
was
more
cheerful
and
almost
pathetically
grateful
one
day
however
hugh
found
an
unstamped
letter
on
the
floor
he
opened
it
wonderingly
dear
hugh
he
read
you
been
awfully
good
to
me
but
i
ca
stand
it
i
going
home
give
my
regards
to
peters
thanks
for
all
you
done
for
me
bert
morse
chapter
vii
for
a
moment
after
reading
morse
letter
hugh
was
genuinely
sorry
but
almost
immediately
he
felt
irritated
and
hurt
he
handed
the
letter
to
carl
who
entered
just
as
he
finished
reading
it
and
exploded
the
simp
and
after
i
wasted
so
much
time
on
him
carl
read
the
letter
i
told
you
so
he
smiled
impishly
you
were
the
wise
boy
you
that
he
would
get
over
it
hugh
should
really
have
felt
grateful
to
morse
it
was
only
a
feeling
of
responsibility
for
him
that
had
made
hugh
prepare
his
own
lessons
day
after
day
he
had
studied
with
morse
in
order
to
cheer
him
up
and
that
was
all
the
studying
he
had
done
latin
and
history
had
little
opportunity
to
claim
his
interest
in
competition
with
the
excitement
around
him
crossing
the
campus
for
the
first
few
weeks
of
college
was
an
adventure
for
every
freshman
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
be
seized
by
a
howling
group
of
sophomores
and
forced
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
for
their
amusement
sometimes
he
was
required
to
do
esthetic
dancing
sometimes
to
sing
or
what
was
more
common
to
make
a
speech
and
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
the
sophomores
were
never
pleased
if
he
danced
they
laughed
at
him
guyed
him
unmercifully
called
attention
to
his
legs
his
awkwardness
urged
him
to
go
faster
insisted
that
he
get
some
pash
into
it
if
he
sang
and
the
frightened
freshman
usually
sang
off
key
they
interrupted
him
after
a
few
notes
told
him
to
sing
something
else
interrupted
that
and
told
him
for
god
sake
to
dance
the
however
provided
the
most
fun
especially
if
the
freshman
was
cleverer
than
his
captors
then
there
was
a
battle
of
wits
and
if
the
freshman
too
successfully
defeated
his
opponents
he
was
dropped
into
a
that
had
stood
on
the
campus
for
more
than
a
century
of
justice
there
was
none
but
of
sport
there
was
a
great
plenty
the
worst
scared
of
the
freshmen
really
enjoyed
the
experience
by
a
strange
sort
of
inverted
logic
he
felt
that
he
was
something
of
a
hero
at
least
for
a
brief
time
he
had
occupied
the
public
eye
he
had
been
initiated
he
was
a
sanford
man
one
freshman
however
found
those
two
weeks
harrowing
that
was
merton
billings
the
fat
man
of
the
class
day
after
day
he
was
captured
by
the
sophomores
and
commanded
to
dance
he
was
an
earnest
youth
and
entirely
without
a
sense
of
humor
dancing
to
him
was
not
only
hard
work
but
downright
wicked
he
was
a
member
of
the
epworth
league
and
he
took
his
membership
seriously
even
david
he
remembered
had
got
in
wrong
because
he
danced
and
he
had
no
desire
to
emulate
david
within
two
days
the
sophomores
discovered
his
religious
ardor
his
horror
of
drinking
smoking
and
dancing
so
they
made
him
dance
while
they
howled
with
glee
at
his
bobbing
stomach
his
short
staggering
legs
his
red
jowls
jigging
and
jouncing
his
pale
blue
eyes
protruding
excitedly
from
their
sockets
his
lips
pressed
tight
together
periodically
popping
open
for
breath
he
was
very
funny
very
angry
and
very
much
ashamed
every
night
he
prayed
that
he
might
be
forgiven
his
sin
a
month
later
when
the
intensity
of
his
hatred
had
subsided
somewhat
he
remembered
to
his
horror
that
he
had
not
prayed
that
his
tormentors
be
forgiven
their
even
greater
sin
he
rectified
the
error
without
delay
not
neglecting
to
ask
that
the
error
be
forgiven
too
hugh
was
forced
to
sing
to
dance
and
to
make
a
speech
but
he
escaped
the
he
thought
the
fellows
were
darned
nice
to
let
him
off
and
they
thought
that
he
was
too
darned
nice
to
be
ducked
although
hugh
did
suspect
it
he
was
winning
immediate
popularity
his
shy
friendly
smile
his
natural
modesty
and
his
boyish
enthusiasm
were
making
a
host
of
friends
for
him
he
liked
the
initiations
on
the
campus
but
he
did
not
like
some
of
them
in
the
dormitories
he
mind
being
pulled
out
of
bed
and
shoved
under
a
cold
shower
he
took
a
cold
shower
every
morning
and
if
the
sophomores
wanted
to
give
him
another
one
at
night
all
right
he
was
willing
he
had
to
confess
that
eliza
crossing
the
ice
had
been
enormous
fun
the
freshmen
were
commanded
to
appear
in
the
common
room
in
their
oldest
clothes
then
all
of
them
the
smallest
lad
excepted
got
down
on
their
hands
and
knees
forming
a
circle
the
smallest
lad
eliza
was
given
a
big
bucket
full
of
water
he
jumped
upon
the
back
of
the
man
nearest
to
him
and
ran
wildly
around
the
circle
leaping
from
back
to
back
the
bucket
swinging
crazily
the
water
splashing
in
every
direction
and
over
everybody
hugh
liked
such
stunts
and
he
liked
putting
on
a
show
with
three
other
freshmen
for
the
amusement
of
their
peers
but
he
did
object
to
the
vulgarity
and
cruelty
of
much
that
was
done
the
first
order
the
sophomores
often
gave
was
strip
freshman
just
why
the
freshmen
had
to
be
naked
before
they
performed
hugh
did
not
know
but
there
was
something
phallic
about
the
proceedings
that
disgusted
him
like
every
athlete
he
thought
nothing
of
nudity
but
he
soon
discovered
that
some
of
the
freshmen
were
intensely
conscious
of
it
true
a
few
months
in
the
gymnasium
cured
them
of
that
consciousness
but
at
first
many
of
them
were
eternally
wrapping
towels
about
themselves
in
the
gymnasium
and
they
took
a
shower
as
if
it
were
an
act
of
public
shame
the
sophomores
recognized
the
timidity
that
some
of
the
freshmen
had
in
revealing
their
bodies
and
they
made
full
capital
of
it
the
shyer
the
freshman
the
more
pointed
their
remarks
the
more
ingeniously
nasty
their
tricks
i
do
mind
the
razzing
myself
hugh
told
carl
after
one
particularly
strenuous
evening
but
i
do
like
the
things
they
said
to
poor
little
wilkins
and
when
they
stripped
and
made
wilkins
read
that
dirty
story
to
culver
i
wanted
to
fight
it
was
kinda
rotten
carl
agreed
but
it
was
funny
it
was
funny
at
all
hugh
said
angrily
carl
looked
at
him
in
surprise
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
seen
him
aroused
it
was
funny
at
all
hugh
repeated
it
was
just
filthy
i
just
about
died
if
i
been
in
wilkins
place
the
poor
kid
they
too
damn
dirty
these
sophomores
i
did
think
that
college
men
could
be
so
dirty
why
not
even
the
bums
at
home
would
think
of
such
things
and
i
telling
you
right
now
that
there
are
three
of
those
guys
that
i
layin
for
just
wait
till
the
class
rush
i
going
to
get
adams
and
then
i
going
to
get
cooper
yes
i
going
to
get
him
even
if
he
is
me
and
i
going
to
get
dodge
i
did
say
anything
when
they
made
me
wash
my
face
in
the
toilet
bowl
but
by
god
i
going
to
get
for
it
three
weeks
later
he
made
good
this
threat
he
was
a
clever
boxer
and
he
succeeded
in
separating
each
of
the
malefactors
from
the
fighting
mob
he
would
have
been
completely
nonplussed
if
he
could
have
heard
adams
and
dodge
talking
in
their
room
after
the
rush
who
gave
you
the
black
eye
adams
asked
dodge
that
freshman
carver
he
replied
touching
the
eye
gingerly
who
gave
you
that
welt
on
the
chin
carver
and
say
he
beat
hi
cooper
to
a
pulp
he
a
mess
they
looked
at
each
other
and
burst
out
laughing
lord
said
dodge
i
going
to
pick
my
freshmen
next
time
who
take
a
kid
with
a
smile
like
his
to
be
a
scrapper
he
got
the
nicest
smile
in
college
why
he
looks
meek
as
a
lamb
you
never
can
tell
remarked
adams
rubbing
his
chin
ruefully
dodge
was
examining
his
eye
in
the
mirror
no
you
never
can
tell
damn
it
i
going
to
have
to
get
a
beefsteak
or
something
for
this
lamp
of
mine
say
he
ought
to
be
a
good
man
for
the
fraternity
adams
said
suddenly
who
dodge
eye
was
absorbing
his
entire
attention
carver
of
course
he
ought
to
make
a
damn
good
man
yeah
you
bet
we
got
to
rush
him
sure
chapter
viii
the
dormitory
initiations
had
more
than
angered
hugh
they
had
completely
upset
his
mental
equilibrium
his
every
ideal
of
college
swayed
and
wabbled
he
was
a
prig
but
he
had
come
to
sanford
with
very
definite
ideas
about
the
place
and
those
ideas
were
already
groggy
from
the
unmerciful
pounding
they
were
receiving
his
father
was
responsible
for
his
illusions
if
one
may
call
them
illusions
mr
carver
was
a
shy
sensitive
man
well
along
in
his
fifties
with
a
wife
twelve
years
his
junior
he
pretended
to
cultivate
his
small
farm
in
merrytown
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
lived
off
of
a
comfortable
income
left
him
by
his
very
capable
father
he
spent
most
of
his
time
reading
the
essayists
john
donne
poetry
the
atlantic
monthly
the
boston
transcript
and
playing
mozart
on
his
violin
he
did
not
understand
his
wife
and
was
thoroughly
afraid
of
his
son
hugh
had
an
animal
vigor
that
at
times
almost
terrified
him
at
his
wife
insistence
he
had
a
talk
with
hugh
the
night
before
the
boy
left
for
college
hugh
had
wanted
to
run
when
he
met
his
father
in
the
library
after
dinner
for
that
talk
he
loved
the
gentle
man
with
the
fine
delicate
features
and
soft
voice
he
had
often
wished
that
he
knew
his
father
mr
carver
was
equally
eager
to
know
hugh
but
he
had
no
idea
of
how
to
go
about
getting
acquainted
with
his
son
they
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fireplace
and
mr
carver
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
boy
why
had
betty
had
this
talk
with
hugh
she
knew
him
so
much
better
than
he
did
they
were
more
like
brother
and
sister
than
mother
and
son
why
hugh
called
her
betty
half
the
time
and
she
seemed
to
understand
him
perfectly
hugh
waited
silently
mr
carver
ran
a
thin
hand
through
his
hair
and
then
sharply
desisted
he
must
let
the
boy
know
that
he
was
nervous
then
he
settled
his
more
firmly
on
his
nose
and
felt
in
his
waistcoat
for
a
cigar
why
did
hugh
say
something
he
snipped
the
end
of
the
cigar
with
a
silver
knife
slowly
he
lighted
the
cigar
inhaled
once
or
twice
coughed
mildly
and
finally
found
his
voice
well
hugh
he
said
in
his
gentle
way
well
dad
hugh
grinned
sheepishly
then
they
both
started
hugh
had
never
called
his
father
dad
before
he
thought
of
him
that
way
always
but
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
dare
anything
but
the
more
formal
father
in
his
embarrassment
he
had
forgotten
himself
i
i
i
sorry
sir
he
stuttered
flushing
painfully
mr
carver
laughed
to
hide
his
own
embarrassment
that
all
right
hugh
his
smile
was
very
kindly
let
it
be
dad
i
think
i
like
it
better
that
fine
hugh
exclaimed
the
tension
was
broken
and
mr
carver
began
to
give
the
dreaded
talk
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
to
you
hugh
he
began
on
the
eve
of
your
going
away
to
college
there
is
so
much
that
you
ought
to
know
and
i
have
no
idea
of
how
much
you
know
already
hugh
thought
of
all
the
smutty
stories
he
had
heard
and
told
instinctively
he
knew
that
his
father
referred
to
what
a
local
doctor
called
the
facts
of
life
he
hung
his
head
and
said
gruffly
i
guess
i
know
a
good
deal
dad
that
splendid
mr
carver
felt
the
full
weight
of
a
responsibilities
lifted
from
his
shoulders
i
believe
hanson
gave
you
a
talk
at
school
about
er
sex
did
he
yes
sir
hugh
was
picking
out
the
design
in
the
rug
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
and
at
the
same
time
unconsciously
pinching
his
leg
he
pinched
so
hard
that
he
afterward
found
a
black
and
blue
spot
but
he
never
knew
how
it
got
there
excellent
thing
excellent
thing
these
talks
by
medical
men
he
was
beginning
to
feel
at
ease
excellent
thing
i
am
glad
that
you
are
so
well
informed
you
are
old
enough
hugh
was
well
informed
he
was
pathetically
ignorant
most
of
what
he
knew
had
come
from
the
smutty
stories
and
he
often
did
not
understand
the
stories
that
he
laughed
at
most
heartily
he
was
consumed
with
curiosity
if
there
is
anything
you
want
to
know
do
hesitate
to
ask
his
father
continued
he
had
a
moment
of
panic
lest
hugh
would
ask
something
but
the
boy
merely
shook
his
head
and
pinched
his
leg
mr
carver
puffed
his
cigar
in
great
relief
well
he
continued
i
do
want
to
give
you
much
advice
but
your
mother
feels
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
a
little
more
about
college
before
you
leave
as
i
have
told
you
before
sanford
is
a
splendid
place
a
er
a
splendid
place
fine
old
traditions
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
splendid
place
you
will
find
a
wonderful
faculty
wonderful
most
of
the
professors
i
had
are
gone
but
i
am
sure
that
the
new
ones
are
quite
as
good
your
opportunities
will
be
enormous
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
take
advantage
of
them
we
have
been
very
proud
of
your
high
school
record
your
mother
and
i
and
we
know
that
you
will
do
quite
as
well
in
college
by
the
way
i
hope
you
take
a
course
in
the
essayists
you
will
find
them
very
stimulating
addison
especially
i
er
your
mother
feels
that
i
ought
to
say
something
about
the
dissipations
of
college
i
i
sure
that
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
suppose
that
there
are
young
men
in
college
who
dissipate
remember
that
i
knew
one
or
two
but
certainly
most
of
them
are
gentlemen
crude
men
vulgarians
do
not
commonly
go
to
college
vulgarity
has
no
place
in
college
you
may
i
presume
meet
some
men
not
altogether
admirable
but
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
you
to
know
them
now
as
to
the
fraternity
hugh
forgot
to
pinch
his
leg
and
looked
up
with
avid
interest
in
his
face
the
nu
deltas
mr
carver
leaned
forward
to
stir
the
fire
with
a
brass
poker
before
he
continued
then
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
comfortably
he
was
completely
at
ease
now
the
worst
was
over
i
have
written
to
the
nu
deltas
about
you
and
told
them
that
i
hoped
that
they
would
find
you
acceptable
as
i
am
sure
they
will
as
a
legacy
you
will
be
among
the
first
considered
for
an
hour
more
he
talked
about
the
fraternity
hugh
his
embarrassment
swallowed
by
his
interest
eagerly
asking
questions
his
father
admiration
for
the
fraternity
was
second
only
to
his
admiration
for
the
college
and
before
the
evening
was
over
he
had
filled
hugh
with
an
idolatry
for
both
he
left
his
father
that
night
feeling
closer
to
him
than
he
ever
had
before
he
was
going
to
be
a
college
man
like
his
father
perhaps
a
nu
delta
too
he
wished
that
they
had
got
chummy
before
when
he
went
to
bed
he
lay
awake
dreaming
thinking
sometimes
of
helen
simpson
and
of
how
he
had
kissed
her
that
afternoon
but
more
often
of
sanford
and
nu
delta
he
was
so
deeply
grateful
to
his
father
for
talking
to
him
frankly
and
telling
him
everything
about
college
he
was
darned
lucky
to
have
a
father
who
was
a
college
grad
and
could
put
him
wise
it
was
pretty
tough
on
the
fellows
whose
fathers
had
never
been
to
college
poor
fellows
they
did
know
the
ropes
the
way
he
did
he
finally
fell
off
to
sleep
picturing
himself
in
the
doorway
of
the
nu
delta
house
welcoming
his
father
to
a
reunion
that
talk
was
returning
to
hugh
repeatedly
he
wondered
if
sanford
had
changed
since
his
father
day
or
if
his
father
had
just
forgotten
what
college
was
like
everything
seemed
so
different
from
what
he
had
been
told
to
expect
perhaps
he
was
just
soft
and
some
of
the
fellows
as
crude
as
he
thought
they
were
chapter
ix
hugh
was
by
no
means
continuously
depressed
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
the
time
he
was
agog
with
delight
especially
over
the
rallies
that
were
occurring
with
increasing
frequency
as
the
football
season
progressed
sometimes
the
rallies
were
carefully
prepared
ceremonies
held
in
the
gymnasium
sometimes
they
were
entirely
spontaneous
a
group
of
men
would
rush
out
of
a
dormitory
or
fraternity
house
yelling
peerade
peerade
instantly
every
one
within
hearing
would
drop
his
books
or
his
cards
and
rush
to
the
yelling
group
which
would
line
up
in
fours
and
begin
circling
the
campus
the
line
ever
getting
longer
as
more
men
came
running
out
of
the
dormitories
and
fraternity
houses
on
on
they
would
go
arm
in
arm
dancing
singing
sanford
songs
past
every
dormitory
on
the
campus
past
every
fraternity
house
pausing
occasionally
to
give
a
cheer
always
however
keeping
one
goal
in
mind
the
fraternity
house
where
the
team
lived
during
the
football
season
then
when
the
and
the
team
were
heading
the
procession
the
mob
would
make
for
the
football
field
with
the
cry
of
wood
freshmen
wood
ringing
down
the
line
hugh
was
always
one
of
the
first
freshmen
to
break
from
the
line
in
his
eagerness
to
get
wood
in
an
incredibly
short
time
he
and
his
classmates
had
found
a
large
quantity
of
old
lumber
empty
boxes
rotten
planks
and
not
very
rotten
gates
when
a
light
was
applied
to
the
clumsy
pile
of
wood
the
flames
leaped
up
quickly
some
one
always
seemed
to
have
a
supply
of
kerosene
ready
and
revealed
the
excited
sitting
on
the
bleachers
dance
freshmen
dance
then
the
freshmen
danced
around
the
fire
holding
hands
and
spreading
into
an
ever
widening
circle
as
the
fire
crackled
and
the
flames
leaped
upward
slowly
almost
impressively
the
chanted
round
the
fire
the
freshmen
go
freshmen
go
freshmen
go
round
the
fire
the
freshmen
go
to
cheer
sanford
the
song
had
a
dozen
stanzas
only
the
last
line
of
each
being
different
the
freshmen
danced
until
the
last
verse
was
sung
which
ended
with
the
sanford
cheer
closer
now
the
freshmen
go
freshmen
go
freshmen
go
closer
now
the
freshmen
go
to
cheer
sanford
sanford
rah
rah
sanford
sanford
san
san
san
san
ford
san
ford
san
ford
while
the
were
singing
the
last
stanza
the
freshmen
slowly
closed
in
on
the
dying
fire
at
the
first
word
of
the
cheer
they
stopped
turned
toward
the
grand
stand
and
joined
the
cheering
that
over
they
broke
and
ran
for
the
bleachers
scrambling
up
the
wooden
stands
shoving
each
other
out
of
the
way
laughing
and
shouting
the
football
captain
usually
made
a
short
and
very
awkward
speech
which
was
madly
applauded
perhaps
the
coach
said
a
few
words
two
or
three
cheers
were
given
and
finally
every
one
rose
took
off
his
hat
if
he
wore
one
nearly
every
one
but
the
freshmen
went
bareheaded
and
sang
the
college
hymn
simply
and
religiously
then
the
crowd
broke
straggling
in
groups
across
the
campus
chatting
singing
shouting
to
each
other
suddenly
lights
began
to
flash
in
the
dormitory
windows
in
less
than
an
hour
after
the
first
cry
of
peerade
the
men
were
back
in
their
rooms
once
more
studying
talking
or
playing
cards
it
was
the
smoker
rallies
though
that
hugh
found
the
most
thrilling
especially
the
last
one
before
the
final
game
of
the
season
the
big
game
with
raleigh
college
there
were
students
in
sanford
and
more
than
were
at
the
rally
a
rough
platform
had
been
built
at
one
end
of
the
gymnasium
on
one
side
of
it
sat
the
band
on
the
other
side
the
glee
club
and
before
it
the
mass
of
students
smoking
cigarettes
pipes
and
occasionally
a
cigar
the
smokes
had
been
furnished
free
by
a
local
tobacconist
so
everybody
smoked
violently
and
too
much
in
half
an
hour
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
the
ceiling
through
the
dull
blue
haze
and
the
men
in
the
rear
of
the
gymnasium
saw
the
speakers
on
the
platform
dimly
through
a
wavering
mist
the
band
played
various
sanford
songs
and
everybody
sang
occasionally
wayne
gifford
the
leaped
upon
the
platform
raised
a
megaphone
to
his
mouth
and
shouted
a
regular
cheer
for
sanford
a
regular
cheer
for
sanford
then
he
lifted
his
arms
above
his
head
flinging
the
megaphone
aside
with
the
same
motion
and
waited
tense
and
rigid
until
the
students
were
on
their
feet
suddenly
he
turned
into
a
mad
dervish
twisting
bending
gesticulating
leaping
running
back
and
forth
across
the
platform
shouting
and
finally
throwing
his
hands
above
his
head
and
springing
high
into
the
air
at
the
concluding
san
ford
the
glee
club
sang
to
mad
applause
a
tenor
twanged
a
ukulele
and
moaned
various
blues
a
popular
professor
told
stories
some
of
them
funny
most
of
them
slightly
off
color
a
former
told
of
the
triumphs
of
former
sanford
teams
and
the
atmosphere
grew
denser
and
denser
bluer
and
bluer
as
the
smoke
wreathed
upward
the
thousand
boys
leaned
intently
forward
occasionally
jumping
to
their
feet
to
shout
and
cheer
and
then
sinking
back
into
their
chairs
tense
and
excited
as
each
speaker
mounted
the
platform
they
shouted
off
with
your
coat
off
with
your
coat
and
the
speakers
even
the
professor
had
to
shed
their
coats
before
they
were
permitted
to
say
a
word
when
the
team
entered
bedlam
broke
loose
every
student
stood
on
his
chair
waved
his
arms
slapped
his
neighbor
on
the
back
or
hugged
him
wildly
threw
his
hat
in
the
air
if
he
had
one
and
so
great
was
his
training
keeping
an
eye
on
the
who
was
on
the
platform
going
through
a
series
of
indescribable
contortions
suddenly
he
straightened
up
held
his
hands
above
his
head
again
and
shouted
through
his
megaphone
a
regular
cheer
for
the
team
a
regular
cheer
for
the
team
make
it
big
big
ready
away
whirled
the
megaphone
and
he
went
through
exactly
the
same
performance
that
he
had
used
before
in
conducting
the
regular
cheer
gifford
looked
like
an
inspired
madman
but
he
knew
exactly
what
he
was
doing
the
students
cheered
lustily
so
lustily
that
some
of
them
were
hoarse
the
next
day
they
continued
to
yell
after
the
cheer
was
completed
ceasing
only
when
gifford
signaled
for
silence
then
there
were
speeches
by
each
member
of
the
team
all
enthusiastically
applauded
and
finally
the
speech
of
the
evening
that
of
the
coach
jack
price
he
was
a
big
compactly
built
man
with
regular
features
heavy
blond
hair
and
pale
cold
blue
eyes
he
threw
off
his
coat
with
a
belligerent
gesture
stuck
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
waited
rigidly
until
the
cheering
had
subsided
then
he
began
go
ahead
and
yell
it
easy
as
hell
to
cheer
here
in
the
gym
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
saturday
afternoon
his
voice
was
sharp
with
sarcasm
and
to
the
shouts
of
yell
fight
that
came
from
all
over
the
gymnasium
he
answered
yeah
maybe
maybe
he
shifted
his
position
stepping
toward
the
front
of
the
platform
thrusting
his
hands
deeper
into
his
pockets
i
seen
a
lot
of
football
games
and
i
seen
lots
of
rooters
but
this
is
the
goddamndest
gang
of
quitters
that
i
ever
seen
what

saturday
when
we
were
behind
i
asking
you

quit
like
a
bunch
of
whipped
curs
god

as

but
the
team
went
on
fighting
and
it
won
won
in
spite
of
you
won
for
a
bunch
of
yellow
pups
and
why
because
the
team
got
guts
and
when
it
was
all
over
you
cheered
and
howled
and
serpentined
and
felt
big
as
hell
lord
almighty
you
acted
as
if
done
something
his
right
hand
came
out
of
his
pocket
with
a
jerk
and
he
extended
a
fighting
clenched
fist
toward
his
breathless
audience
i
tell
you
something
he
said
slowly
viciously
the
team
ca

alone
day
after
ca
win
alone
you
got
to
fight
damn
it
got
to
fight

only
one
way
that

back
of
the
team
every
goddamned
mother
son
of
you
the
team
good
but
it
ca
win
unless
you
fight
suddenly
his
voice
grew
softer
almost
gentle
he
held
out
both
hands
to
the
boys
who
had
become
so
tense
that
they
had
forgotten
to
smoke
we
got
to
win
fellows
for
old
sanford
are
you
back
of
us
yes
the
tension
shattered
into
a
thousand
yells
the
boys
leaped
on
the
chairs
and
shouted
until
they
could
shout
no
more
when
gifford
called
for
a
regular
cheer
for
jack
price
and
then
one
for
the
team
make
it
the
biggest
you
ever
gave
they
could
respond
with
only
a
hoarse
croak
finally
the
hymn
was
sung
at
least
the
boys
tried
loyally
to
sing
it
and
they
stood
silent
and
almost
reverent
as
the
team
filed
out
of
the
gymnasium
hugh
walked
back
to
surrey
hall
with
several
men
no
one
said
a
word
except
a
quiet
good
night
as
they
parted
carl
was
in
the
room
when
he
arrived
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
finally
he
said
in
a
happy
whisper
was
it
wonderful
carl
damn
good
gosh
i
hope
we
win
we
to
carl
looked
up
his
cheeks
redder
than
usual
his
eyes
glittering
god
yes
he
breathed
piously
chapter
x
the
football
season
lasted
from
the
first
of
october
to
the
latter
part
of
november
and
during
those
weeks
little
was
talked
about
or
even
thought
about
on
the
campus
but
football
there
were
undergraduates
who
knew
the
personnel
of
virtually
every
football
team
in
the
country
the
teams
that
had
played
against
each
other
their
relative
merits
the
various
scores
the
outstanding
players
of
each
position
half
the
students
at
sanford
regularly
made
out
all
american
teams
and
each
man
was
more
than
willing
to
debate
the
quality
of
his
team
against
that
of
any
other
night
after
night
the
students
gathered
in
groups
in
dormitory
rooms
and
fraternity
houses
discussing
football
football
football
even
religion
and
sex
the
favorite
topics
for
bull
sessions
could
not
compete
with
football
especially
when
some
one
mentioned
raleigh
college
raleigh
was
sanford
ancient
rival
to
defeat
her
was
of
cosmic
importance
there
was
a
game
every
saturday
about
half
the
time
the
team
played
at
home
the
other
games
were
played
on
the
rivals
fields
no
matter
how
far
away
the
team
traveled
the
college
traveled
with
it
the
men
who
had
the
necessary
money
went
by
train
a
few
owned
automobiles
but
most
of
the
undergraduates
had
neither
an
automobile
nor
money
for
train
fare
they
bummed
their
way
some
of
them
emulated
professional
tramps
and
rode
the
beams
but
most
of
them
started
out
walking
trusting
that
motorists
would
pick
them
up
and
carry
them
at
least
part
way
to
their
destination
although
the
distances
were
sometimes
great
and
although
many
motorists
are
not
kind
there
is
no
record
of
any
man
who
ever
started
for
a
game
not
arriving
in
time
for
the
referee
first
whistle
somehow
by
hook
or
by
crook
and
it
was
often
by
crook
the
boys
got
there
and
what
is
more
astonishing
they
got
back
on
monday
morning
at
they
were
in
chapel
usually
worn
and
tired
it
is
true
ready
to
bluff
their
way
through
the
assignments
and
damning
any
instructor
who
was
heartless
enough
to
give
them
a
quiz
some
of
them
were
worn
out
from
really
harsh
traveling
experiences
some
of
them
had
more
exciting
adventures
to
relate
behind
closed
doors
to
selected
groups
of
confidants
football
nothing
else
mattered
and
as
the
weeks
passed
the
excitement
grew
especially
as
the
day
drew
near
for
the
raleigh
game
which
this
year
was
to
be
played
on
the
sanford
field
what
were
sanford
chances
would
harry
slade
sanford
great
make
all
american
damn
it
to
hell
he
ought
to
it
be
a
stinkin
shame
if
he
do
would
raleigh
line
be
able
to
stop
slade
end
runs
slade
slade
he
was
the
team
the
hope
and
adoration
of
the
whole
college
three
days
before
the
big
game
the
alumni
began
to
pour
into
town
most
of
them
fairly
recent
graduates
but
many
of
them
men
who
boasted
that
they
had
missed
a
game
in
thirty
years
hundreds
of
alumni
arrived
filling
the
two
hotels
to
capacity
and
overrunning
the
fraternity
houses
the
students
doubling
up
or
seeking
hospitality
from
a
friend
in
a
dormitory
in
the
little
room
in
the
rear
of
the
sanford
pool
and
billiard
parlors
there
was
almost
continual
excitement
jim
mccarty
the
proprietor
a
big
jovial
man
whom
all
the
students
called
mac
was
the
official
for
the
college
bets
for
any
amount
could
be
placed
with
him
money
from
raleigh
flowed
into
his
pudgy
hands
and
he
placed
it
at
the
odds
offered
with
eager
sanford
takers
by
the
day
of
the
game
his
safe
held
thousands
of
dollars
most
of
it
wagered
at
five
to
three
raleigh
offering
odds
there
was
hardly
an
alumnus
who
did
not
prove
his
loyalty
to
sanford
by
visiting
mac
back
room
and
putting
down
a
few
greenbacks
at
least
some
were
more
loyal
than
others
the
most
loyal
placed
a
thousand
dollars
at
five
to
two
there
was
rain
for
two
days
before
the
game
but
on
friday
night
the
clouds
broke
a
full
moon
seemed
to
shine
them
away
and
the
whole
campus
rejoiced
with
great
enthusiasm
most
of
the
alumni
got
drunk
to
show
their
deep
appreciation
to
the
moon
and
many
of
the
undergraduates
followed
the
example
set
by
their
elders
all
friday
afternoon
girls
had
been
arriving
dozens
of
them
to
attend
the
fraternity
dances
one
dormitory
had
been
set
aside
for
them
the
normal
residents
seeking
shelter
in
other
dormitories
no
man
ever
objected
to
resigning
his
room
to
a
girl
he
never
could
tell
what
he
would
find
when
he
returned
to
it
monday
morning
some
of
the
girls
left
strange
mementos
no
one
except
a
few
notorious
grinds
studied
that
night
some
of
the
students
were
of
course
at
the
fraternity
dances
some
of
them
sat
in
dormitory
rooms
and
discussed
the
coming
game
from
every
possible
angle
and
groups
of
them
wandered
around
the
campus
peering
into
the
fraternity
houses
commenting
on
the
girls
wandering
on
humming
a
song
that
an
orchestra
had
been
playing
occasionally
pausing
to
give
a
regular
cheer
for
the
moon
hugh
was
too
much
excited
to
stay
in
a
room
so
with
several
other
freshmen
he
traveled
the
campus
he
passionately
envied
the
dancers
in
the
fraternity
houses
but
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
maybe
i
be
dancing
at
the
nu
delt
house
next
year
then
he
had
a
spasm
of
fright
perhaps
the
nu
delts
perhaps
no
fraternity
would
bid
him
the
moon
lost
its
brilliance
for
a
moment
even
the
game
was
forgotten
the
boys
were
standing
before
a
fraternity
house
and
as
the
music
ceased
jack
collings
suggested
let
serenade
them
you
lead
hugh
hugh
had
a
sweet
light
tenor
voice
it
was
not
at
all
remarkable
just
clear
and
true
but
he
had
easily
made
the
glee
club
and
had
an
excellent
chance
to
be
chosen
freshman
collings
had
brought
a
guitar
with
him
he
handed
it
to
hugh
who
like
most
musical
undergraduates
could
play
both
a
guitar
and
a
banjo
sing
that
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
thing
that
you
were
singing
the
other
night
we
hum
hugh
slipped
the
cord
around
his
neck
tuned
the
guitar
and
then
thrummed
a
few
opening
chords
his
heart
was
beating
at
double
time
he
was
very
happy
he
was
serenading
girls
at
a
fraternity
dance
couples
were
strolling
out
upon
the
veranda
the
girls
throwing
warm
wraps
over
their
shoulders
the
men
lighting
cigarettes
and
tossing
the
burnt
matches
on
the
lawn
their
white
gleamed
eerily
in
the
pale
light
cast
by
the
japanese
lanterns
with
which
the
veranda
was
hung
hugh
began
to
sing
shelley
passionate
lyric
set
so
well
to
music
by
tod
galloway
his
mother
had
taught
him
the
song
and
he
loved
it
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
in
the
first
sweet
sleep
of
night
when
the
winds
are
breathing
low
and
the
stars
are
shining
bright
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
and
a
spirit
in
my
feet
hath
led
me
who
knows
how
to
thy
sweet
two
of
the
boys
who
had
heard
hugh
sing
the
song
before
hummed
a
soft
accompaniment
when
he
began
the
second
verse
several
more
began
to
hum
they
had
caught
the
melody
the
couples
on
the
veranda
moved
quietly
to
the
porch
railing
their
chatter
silent
their
attention
focused
on
a
group
of
dim
figures
standing
in
the
shadow
of
an
elm
hugh
was
singing
well
better
than
he
ever
had
before
neither
he
nor
his
audience
knew
that
the
lyric
was
immortal
but
its
tender
passionate
beauty
caught
and
held
them
the
wandering
airs
they
faint
on
the
dark
the
silent
stream
the
champak
odors
fail
like
in
a
dream
the
nightingale
complaint
it
dies
upon
her
heart
as
i
must
die
on
thine
o
beloved
as
thou
art
oh
lift
me
from
the
grass
i
die
i
faint
i
fail
let
thy
love
in
kisses
rain
on
my
cheeks
and
eyelids
pale
my
cheek
is
cold
and
white
alas
my
heart
beats
loud
and
fast
oh
press
it
close
to
thine
again
where
it
will
break
at
last
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
after
hugh
finished
the
shadows
the
moonlight
the
boy
soft
young
voice
had
moved
them
all
suddenly
a
girl
on
the
veranda
cried
bring
him
up
instantly
half
a
dozen
others
turned
to
their
escorts
insisting
shrilly
bring
him
up
we
want
to
see
him
hugh
jerked
the
guitar
cord
from
around
his
neck
banded
the
instrument
to
collings
and
tried
to
run
a
burst
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
freshmen
they
caught
him
and
held
him
fast
until
the
rushed
down
from
the
veranda
and
had
him
by
the
arms
they
pulled
him
protesting
and
struggling
upon
the
veranda
and
into
the
the
girls
gathered
around
him
praising
demanding
more
he
flushed
scarlet
when
one
enthusiastic
maiden
forced
her
way
through
the
ring
looked
hard
at
him
and
then
announced
positively
i
think
he
sweet
he
was
intensely
embarrassed
in
an
agony
of
confusion
but
very
happy
the
girls
liked
his
clean
blondness
his
blushes
his
startled
smile
how
long
they
would
have
held
him
there
in
the
center
of
the
ring
while
they
admired
and
teased
him
there
is
no
telling
but
suddenly
the
orchestra
brought
relief
by
striking
up
a
he
mine
cried
a
pretty
girl
with
a
cloud
of
bobbed
hair
and
flaming
cheeks
her
slender
shoulders
were
bare
her
round
white
arms
waved
in
excited
graceful
gestures
her
frock
was
a
gauzy
mist
she
clutched
hugh
arm
he
mine
she
repeated
shrilly
he
going
to
dance
with
me
hugh
cheeks
burned
a
deeper
scarlet
my
clothes
he
muttered
hesitating
your
clothes
my
dear
you
look
sweet
take
off
your
cap
and
dance
with
me
hugh
snatched
off
his
cap
his
mind
reeling
with
shame
but
he
had
no
time
to
think
the
girl
pulled
him
through
the
crowd
to
a
clear
floor
almost
mechanically
hugh
put
his
arm
around
her
and
began
to
dance
he
dance
and
the
girl
had
sense
enough
not
to
talk
she
floated
in
his
arm
her
slender
body
close
to
his
when
the
music
ceased
she
clapped
her
little
hands
excitedly
and
told
hugh
that
he
danced
after
the
third
encore
she
led
him
to
a
dark
corner
in
the
hall
you
sweet
honey
she
said
softly
she
turned
her
small
glowing
face
up
to
his
kiss
me
she
commanded
dazed
hugh
gathered
her
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
little
red
mouth
she
clung
to
him
for
a
minute
and
then
pushed
him
gently
away
good
night
honey
she
whispered
good
night
hugh
voice
broke
huskily
he
turned
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
hall
upon
the
veranda
and
down
the
steps
his
classmates
were
waiting
for
him
they
rushed
up
to
him
demanding
that
he
tell
them
what
had
happened
he
told
them
most
of
it
especially
about
the
dance
but
he
neglected
to
mention
the
kiss
shyness
overcame
any
desire
that
he
had
to
strut
besides
there
was
something
about
that
kiss
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
tell
any
one
even
carl
when
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
did
not
think
once
about
the
coming
football
game
before
his
eyes
floated
the
girl
in
the
frock
he
wished
he
knew
her
name
closer
and
closer
she
came
to
him
he
could
feel
her
cool
arms
around
his
neck
what
a
wonderful
wonderful
girl
sweeter
than
helen
lots
sweeter
she
like
the
night
and
moonlight
like
moonlight
and
the
music
of
the
indian
serenade
began
to
thrill
through
his
mind
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
in
the
first
sweet
sleep
of
night
oh
she
sweet
sweet
like
music
and
moonlight
he
fell
asleep
repeating
music
and
moonlight
over
and
over
again
music
and
moonlight
the
morning
of
the
big
game
proved
ideal
crisp
and
cold
crystal
clear
indian
summer
was
near
its
close
but
there
was
still
something
of
its
dreamy
wonder
in
the
air
and
the
hills
still
flamed
with
glorious
autumn
foliage
the
purples
the
mauves
the
scarlets
the
burnt
oranges
were
a
little
dimmed
a
little
less
brilliant
the
leaves
were
rustling
dryly
now
but
there
was
beauty
in
dying
autumn
its
splendor
slowly
fading
as
there
was
in
its
first
startling
burst
of
color
classes
that
saturday
morning
were
a
farce
but
they
were
held
the
administration
which
the
boys
damned
heartily
insisted
upon
it
some
of
the
instructors
merely
took
the
roll
and
dismissed
their
classes
feeling
that
honor
had
been
satisfied
but
others
held
their
classes
through
the
hour
lecturing
the
disgusted
students
on
their
lack
of
interest
warning
them
that
examinations
were
as
far
off
as
the
millennium
hugh
felt
that
he
was
lucky
he
had
only
one
class
it
was
with
alling
in
latin
and
it
had
been
promptly
dismissed
when
the
day
comes
said
alling
that
latin
can
compete
with
football
i
well
i
probably
get
a
living
wage
you
had
better
go
before
i
get
to
talking
about
a
living
wage
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
topics
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
door
the
boys
roared
with
delight
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
shoving
each
other
and
laughing
they
ran
out
of
the
building
all
of
them
were
too
excited
to
walk
by
one
the
stands
were
filled
most
of
the
girls
wore
fur
coats
as
did
many
of
the
alumni
but
the
students
sported
no
such
luxuries
nine
tenths
of
them
wore
coats
gray
jackets
lined
with
sheep
wool
except
for
an
occasional
banner
usually
carried
by
a
girl
and
the
bright
hats
of
the
women
there
was
little
color
to
the
scene
the
air
was
sharp
and
the
spectators
huddled
down
into
their
warm
coats
the
rival
cheering
sections
seated
on
opposite
sides
of
the
field
alternated
in
cheering
and
singing
each
applauding
the
other
efforts
the
cheering
was
very
good
and
the
singing
was
worse
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
that
was
about
all
that
mattered
to
either
side
a
few
minutes
before
two
the
raleigh
team
ran
upon
the
field
the
raleigh
cheering
section
promptly
went
mad
when
the
sanford
team
appeared
a
minute
later
the
sanford
cheering
section
tried
its
best
to
go
madder
the
boys
whistling
and
yelling
like
possessed
demons
wayne
gifford
brought
them
to
attention
by
holding
his
hands
above
his
head
he
called
for
the
usual
regular
cheer
for
the
team
and
then
for
a
short
cheer
for
each
member
of
it
starting
with
the
captain
sherman
walford
and
ending
with
the
great
harry
slade
suddenly
there
was
silence
the
had
been
completed
the
teams
were
in
position
on
the
field
slade
had
finished
building
a
slender
pyramid
of
mud
on
which
he
had
balanced
the
ball
the
referee
held
up
his
hand
are
you
ready
sanford
walford
signaled
his
readiness
are
you
ready
raleigh
the
shrill
blast
of
the
referee
whistle
and
the
game
was
on
the
first
half
was
a
up
and
down
the
field
near
the
end
of
the
half
raleigh
was
within
twenty
yards
of
the
sanford
line
shouts
of
score
score
score
went
up
from
the
raleigh
rooters
rhythmic
insistent
hold
hold
fight
fight
fight
the
sanford
cheering
section
pleaded
almost
sobbing
the
words
a
forward
pass
skilfully
completed
netted
raleigh
sixteen
yards
fight
fight
fight
the
timekeeper
tooted
his
little
horn
the
half
was
over
for
a
moment
the
sanford
boys
leaned
back
exhausted
then
they
leaped
to
their
feet
and
yelled
madly
while
the
raleigh
boys
leaned
back
or
against
each
other
and
swore
fervently
within
two
minutes
the
tension
had
departed
the
rival
cheering
sections
alternated
in
singing
songs
applauded
each
other
vigorously
whistled
at
a
frightened
dog
that
tried
to
cross
the
field
and
nearly
lost
its
mind
entirely
when
called
by
a
thousand
masters
waited
breathlessly
when
the
announced
the
results
from
other
football
games
that
had
been
telegraphed
to
the
field
applauded
if
harvard
was
losing
groaned
if
it
was
sang
some
more
relaxed
and
felt
consummately
happy
sanford
immediately
took
the
offensive
in
the
second
half
slade
was
consistently
carrying
the
ball
twice
he
brought
it
within
line
the
first
time
raleigh
held
firm
but
the
second
time
slade
stepped
back
for
a
the
spectators
sat
silent
breathless
the
angle
was
difficult
could
he
make
it
would
the
line
hold
quite
calmly
slade
waited
the
center
passed
the
ball
neatly
slade
turned
it
in
his
hands
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
mad
struggle
going
on
a
few
feet
in
front
of
him
dropped
the
ball
and
kicked
the
ball
rose
in
a
graceful
arc
and
passed
safely
between
the
every
one
men
and
women
alike
the
raleigh
adherents
excepted
promptly
turned
into
extraordinarily
active
lunatics
the
women
waved
their
banners
and
shrieked
or
if
they
had
no
banners
they
waved
their
arms
and
shrieked
the
men
danced
up
and
down
yelled
pounded
each
other
on
the
back
sometimes
wildly
embraced
many
a
woman
was
kissed
by
a
man
she
had
never
seen
before
and
never
would
again
nor
did
she
object
wayne
gifford
was
turning
handsprings
and
many
of
the
students
were
feebly
fluttering
their
hands
voiceless
spent
with
cheering
weak
from
excitement
early
in
the
fourth
quarter
however
raleigh
got
its
revenge
carrying
the
ball
to
a
after
a
series
of
line
rushes
sanford
tried
desperately
to
score
again
but
its
best
efforts
were
useless
against
the
raleigh
defense
the
final
whistle
blew
and
sanford
had
lost
cheering
wildly
tossing
their
hats
into
the
air
the
raleigh
students
piled
down
from
the
grand
stand
upon
the
field
with
the
at
the
head
waving
their
megaphones
the
boys
rapidly
formed
into
a
long
line
in
uneven
groups
holding
arms
dancing
shouting
winding
in
and
out
around
the
field
between
the
tossing
their
hats
over
the
bars
waving
their
hands
at
the
sanford
men
standing
despondently
in
their
places
in
and
out
in
and
out
in
the
triumphant
serpentine
finally
they
paused
took
off
their
hats
cheered
first
their
own
team
then
the
sanford
team
and
then
sang
their
hymn
while
the
sanford
men
respectfully
uncovered
silent
and
despairing
when
the
hymn
was
over
the
sanford
men
quietly
left
the
grand
stand
quietly
formed
into
a
long
line
in
groups
of
fours
quietly
marched
to
the
college
flagpole
in
the
center
of
the
campus
a
sanford
banner
was
flying
from
the
pole
a
blue
banner
with
an
orange
wayne
gifford
loosened
the
ropes
down
fluttered
the
banner
and
the
boys
reverently
took
off
their
hats
gifford
caught
the
banner
before
it
touched
the
ground
and
gathered
it
into
his
arms
the
stepped
beside
him
he
lifted
his
hand
sang
a
note
and
then
the
boys
sang
with
him
huskily
sadly
some
of
them
with
tears
streaming
down
their
cheeks
sanford

slowly
the
circle
broke
into
small
groups
that
straggled
wearily
across
the
campus
hugh
with
two
or
three
others
was
walking
behind
two
young
professors
one
of
them
alling
the
other
jones
of
the
economics
department
hugh
was
almost
literally
the
defeat
lay
on
him
like
an
awful
sorrow
that
never
could
be
lifted
every
inch
of
him
ached
but
his
despair
was
greater
than
his
physical
pain
the
sharp
clear
voice
of
jones
broke
into
his
consciousness

all
this
emotional
excitement
said
jones
crisply
a
football
game
is
a
football
game
not
a
national
calamity
i
enjoy
the
game
myself
but
why
weep
over
it
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
anything
more
absurd
than
those
boys
singing
with
tears
running
into
their
mouths
shocked
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
they
started
to
make
angry
remarks
but
paused
as
alling
spoke
of
course
what
you
say
jones
is
quite
right
he
remarked
calmly
quite
right
but
do
you
know
i
pity
you
alling
a
good
guy
hugh
told
carl
later
he
human
chapter
xi
after
the
game
the
college
seemed
to
be
slowly
dying
the
boys
held
countless
over
the
game
explaining
to
each
other
just
how
it
had
been
lost
or
how
it
could
have
been
won
they
watched
the
newspapers
eagerly
as
the
sport
writers
announced
their
choice
for
the
all
american
team
if
slade
was
on
the
team
the
writer
was
conceded
to
know
his
dope
if
slade
was
the
writer
was
a
dumbbell
but
all
this
was
merely
picking
at
the
covers
there
was
no
real
heart
in
it
gradually
the
football
talk
died
down
freshmen
ceased
to
write
themes
about
sanford
great
fighting
spirit
sex
and
religion
once
more
became
predominant
at
the
bull
sessions
studies
too
began
to
find
a
place
in
the
sun
hour
examinations
were
coming
and
most
of
the
boys
knew
that
they
were
miserably
prepared
lights
were
burning
in
fraternity
houses
and
dormitories
until
late
at
night
and
mighty
little
of
their
glow
was
shed
on
poker
parties
and
crap
games
the
college
had
begun
to
study
when
hugh
finally
calmed
down
and
took
stock
he
was
horrified
and
frightened
to
discover
how
far
he
was
behind
in
all
his
work
he
had
done
his
lessons
sketchily
from
day
to
day
but
he
really
knew
nothing
about
them
and
he
knew
that
he
did
since
morse
departure
he
had
loafed
trusting
to
luck
and
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
in
high
school
so
far
he
had
escaped
a
summons
from
the
dean
but
he
daily
expected
one
and
the
mere
thought
of
hour
examinations
made
him
shiver
he
studied
hard
for
a
week
succeeding
only
in
getting
gloriously
confused
and
more
frightened
the
examinations
proved
to
be
easier
than
he
had
expected
he
did
fail
in
any
of
them
but
he
did
not
get
a
grade
above
a
the
examination
flurry
passed
and
the
college
was
left
cold
nothing
seemed
to
happen
the
boys
went
to
the
movies
every
night
had
a
peanut
fight
talked
to
the
shadowy
actors
they
played
cards
pool
and
billiards
or
shot
craps
saturday
nights
many
of
them
went
to
a
dance
at
hastings
a
small
town
five
miles
away
they
held
bull
sessions
and
discussed
everything
under
the
sun
and
some
things
beyond
it
they
attended
a
performance
of
shaw
candida
given
by
the
dramatic
society
and
voted
it
a
wet
show
and
incidentally
some
of
them
studied
but
all
in
all
life
was
rather
tepid
and
most
of
the
boys
were
merely
marking
time
and
waiting
for
christmas
vacation
for
hugh
the
vacation
came
and
went
with
a
rush
it
was
glorious
to
get
home
again
glorious
to
see
his
father
and
mother
and
at
first
glorious
to
see
helen
simpson
but
helen
had
begun
to
pall
her
kisses
hardly
compensated
for
her
conversation
she
gave
him
a
little
feeling
of
guilt
too
which
he
tried
to
argue
away
kissing
is
really
wrong
everybody
pets
at
least
carl
says
they
do
helen
likes
it
but
always
that
but
intruded
itself
but
it
does
seem
quite
right
when
i
do
really
love
her
when
he
kissed
her
for
the
last
time
before
returning
to
college
he
had
a
distinct
feeling
of
relief
well
that
would
be
off
his
mind
for
a
while
anyway
it
was
a
sober
quiet
crowd
of
students
for
the
first
time
they
were
students
that
returned
to
their
desks
after
the
vacation
the
final
examinations
were
ahead
of
them
less
than
a
month
away
and
those
examinations
hung
over
their
heads
like
the
relentless
glittering
blade
of
a
guillotine
the
boys
studied
college
life
ceased
there
was
a
brief
period
of
education
of
course
they
did
not
desert
the
movies
and
the
snow
and
ice
claimed
them
part
of
indian
lake
was
scraped
free
of
snow
and
every
clear
afternoon
hundreds
of
boys
skated
happily
explaining
afterward
that
they
had
to
have
some
exercise
if
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
study
on
those
afternoons
the
lake
was
a
pretty
sight
zestful
alive
with
color
many
of
the
men
wore
blue
sweaters
some
of
them
brightly
colored
mackinaws
all
of
them
knitted
toques
as
soon
as
the
cold
weather
arrived
the
freshmen
had
been
permitted
to
substitute
blue
toques
with
orange
tassels
for
their
baby
bonnets
the
blue
and
orange
stood
out
vividly
against
the
white
hills
and
the
skates
rang
sharply
as
they
cut
the
glare
ice
there
was
skiing
and
sliding
to
keep
a
fellow
fit
so
that
he
could
do
good
work
in
his
exams
but
much
as
the
boys
enjoyed
the
winter
sports
a
black
pall
hung
over
the
college
as
the
examination
period
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
library
which
had
been
virtually
deserted
all
term
suddenly
became
crowded
every
afternoon
and
evening
its
big
tables
were
filled
with
lads
earnestly
bending
over
books
making
notes
running
their
fingers
through
their
hair
occasionally
looking
up
with
dazed
eyes
or
twisting
about
miserably
the
tension
grew
greater
and
greater
the
were
quiet
and
businesslike
but
most
of
the
freshmen
were
frankly
terrified
a
few
of
them
packed
their
trunks
and
slunk
away
and
a
few
more
openly
scorned
the
examinations
and
their
frightened
classmates
but
they
were
the
exceptions
all
the
buoyancy
seemed
gone
out
of
the
college
nothing
was
left
but
an
intense
strain
the
dormitories
were
strangely
quiet
at
night
there
was
no
playing
of
golf
in
the
hallways
no
rolling
of
bats
down
the
stairs
no
shouting
no
laughter
a
man
who
made
any
noise
was
in
danger
of
a
serious
beating
even
the
greetings
as
the
men
passed
each
other
on
the
campus
were
quiet
and
abstracted
they
ceased
to
cut
classes
everybody
attended
and
everybody
paid
close
attention
even
to
the
most
tiresome
instructors
studious
seniors
began
to
reap
a
harvest
out
of
tutoring
sections
the
meetings
were
a
dollar
a
throw
and
for
another
dollar
a
student
could
get
a
mimeographed
outline
of
a
course
but
the
tutoring
sections
were
only
for
the
plutes
or
the
athletes
many
of
whom
were
subsidized
by
fraternities
or
alumni
most
of
the
students
had
to
learn
their
own
lessons
so
they
often
banded
together
in
small
groups
to
make
the
task
less
arduous
finding
some
relief
in
sociability
the
study
groups
quite
properly
called
seminars
would
have
shocked
many
a
worthy
professor
had
he
been
able
to
attend
one
but
they
were
truly
educative
and
to
many
students
inspiring
the
professor
had
planted
the
seed
of
wisdom
with
them
it
was
at
the
seminars
that
they
tried
honestly
if
somewhat
hysterically
and
irreverently
to
make
it
grow
hugh
did
most
of
his
studying
alone
fearing
that
the
seminars
would
degenerate
into
bull
sessions
as
many
of
them
did
but
carl
insisted
that
he
join
one
group
that
was
going
to
wipe
up
that
goddamned
english
course
there
were
only
five
men
at
the
seminar
which
met
in
surrey
because
pudge
jamieson
who
was
rating
an
a
in
the
course
and
was
therefore
an
authority
said
that
he
would
come
if
there
were
any
more
pudge
as
his
nickname
suggests
was
plump
he
was
a
jovial
youngster
who
learned
everything
with
consummate
ease
wrote
with
great
fluency
and
sometimes
real
beauty
peered
through
his
spectacles
amusedly
at
the
world
and
read
every
smut
book
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
his
library
of
erotica
was
already
famous
throughout
the
college
his
volumes
of
balzac
droll
stories
rabelais
complete
mlle
de
maupin
burton
arabian
nights
and
the
decameron
being
in
constant
demand
he
could
tell
literally
hundreds
of
dirty
stories
always
having
a
new
one
on
tap
always
looking
when
he
told
it
like
a
complacent
cherub
there
were
two
other
men
in
the
seminar
freddy
dickson
an
earnest
anemic
youth
seemed
to
be
always
striving
for
greater
acceleration
and
never
gaining
it
or
as
pudge
put
it
the
trouble
with
freddy
is
that
he
always
shifting
gears
larry
stillwell
the
last
man
was
a
dark
handsome
youth
with
exceedingly
regular
features
pomaded
hair
parted
in
the
center
and
shining
sleekly
fine
teeth
and
rich
coloring
a
smooth
boy
who
prided
himself
on
his
conquests
and
the
fact
that
he
never
got
a
grade
above
a
c
in
his
courses
there
was
no
man
in
the
freshman
class
with
a
finer
mind
but
he
declined
to
study
declaring
firmly
that
he
could
not
waste
his
time
acquiring
impractical
tastes
for
useless
arts
now
everybody
shut
up
said
pudge
seating
himself
in
a
big
chair
and
laboriously
crossing
one
leg
over
the
other
put
some
more
wood
on
the
fire
hugh
will
you
hugh
stirred
up
the
fire
piled
on
a
log
or
so
and
then
returned
to
his
chair
hoping
against
belief
that
something
really
would
be
accomplished
in
the
seminar
all
the
boys
he
excepted
were
smoking
and
all
of
them
were
lolling
back
in
dangerously
comfortable
attitudes
we
got
to
get
going
pudge
continued
and
we
are
going
to
get
anything
done
if
we
just
sit
around
and
bull
i
the
prof
and
going
to
ask
questions
now
do
bull
if
you
do
know
just
say
soap
and
if
you
do
know
shoot
your
dope
he
grinned
how
that
for
a
rime
atta
boy
carl
exclaimed
enthusiastically
shut
up
now
the
stuff
we
want
to
get
at
is
the
poetry
no
use
spending
any
time
on
the
composition
my
prof
said
that
we
would
have
to
write
themes
in
the
exam
but
we
ca
do
anything
about
that
here
you
all
getting
by
on
your
themes
anyway
are
you
yeah
the
listening
quartet
answered
in
unison
larry
stillwell
adding
dubiously
well
i
getting
c
larry
said
carl
in
cold
contempt
you
a
goddamn
liar
i
saw
a
b
on
one
of
your
themes
the
other
day
and
an
a
on
another
what
are
you
always
pulling
that
stuff
for
larry
had
the
grace
to
blush
aw
he
explained
in
some
confusion
my
prof
full
of
hooey
he
does
know
a
c
theme
from
an
a
one
he
makes
me
sick
he
aw
shut
up
freddy
dickson
shouted
let
get
going
let
get
going
we
got
ta
learn
this
poetry
damn
i
do
know
anything
about
it
i
did
crack
the
book
till
two
days
ago
pudge
took
charge
again
close
your
gabs
everybody
he
commanded
sternly
there
no
sense
in
going
over
the
prose
lit
you
can
do
that
better
by
yourselves
god
knows
i
not
going
to
waste
my
time
telling
you
what
carlyle
means
by
a
hero
if
you
do
know
odin
from
mohammed
by
this
time
you
can
roast
in
dante
hell
for
all
of
me
now
listen
the
prof
said
that
they
were
going
to
make
us
place
lines
and
of
course
they
expect
us
to
know
what
the
poems
are
about
hell
how
some
of
the
boys
are
going
to
fox
he
paused
to
laugh
jim
hicks
told
me
this
afternoon
that
was
by
shakspere
the
other
boys
did
not
understand
the
joke
but
they
all
laughed
heartily
now
he
went
on
i
give
you
the
name
of
a
poem
and
then
you
tell
me
what
it
about
and
who
wrote
it
he
leafed
rapidly
through
an
anthology
carl
who
wrote
khan
carl
puffed
his
pipe
meditatively
i
going
to
fox
you
pudge
he
said
frankly
triumphant
i
know
coleridge
wrote
it
it
seems
to
be
about
a
jew
who
built
a
swell
joint
for
a
wild
woman
or
something
like
that
i
ca
make
much
out
of
the
damn
thing
that
enough
smack
for
carl
said
pudge
approvingly
smack
meant
that
the
answer
was
satisfactory
freddy
who
wrote
belle
dame
sans
merci
freddy
twisted
in
his
chair
thumped
his
head
with
his
knuckles
and
finally
announced
with
a
groan
of
despair
no
soap
hugh
no
soap
larry
well
drawled
larry
i
think
jawn
keats
wrote
it
it
one
of
those
bedtime
stories
with
a
kick
a
knight
gets
picked
up
by
a
jane
he
puts
her
on
his
prancing
steed
and
beats
it
for
the
tall
timber
keats
very
plain
about
what
happened
there
but
i
suspect
the
worst
anyhow
the
knight
woke
up
the
next
morning
with
an
awful
rotten
taste
in
his
mouth
smack
for
larry
your
turn
carl
who
wrote
west
wind
you
ca
get
me
on
that
boy
masefield
pudge
i
know
all
his
stuff
there
is
any
story
it
just
about
the
west
wind
but
it
a
goddamn
good
poem
it
the
cat
pajamas
you
said
it
carl
hugh
chimed
in
but
i
like
fever
better
i
must
go
down
to
the
seas
again
to
the
lonely
sea
and
the
sky
gosh
that
hot
stuff
s
a
peach
too
yeah
agreed
larry
languidly
i
got
a
great
kick
when
the
prof
read
that
in
class
masefield
all
right
i
wish
we
had
more
of
his
stuff
and
less
of
milton
lord
almighty
how
i
hate
milton
what
th
hell
do
they
have
to
give
us
that
tripe
for
oh
let
get
going
freddy
pleaded
running
a
nervous
hand
through
his
hair
shoot
a
question
pudge
all
right
freddy
pudge
tried
to
smile
wickedly
but
succeeded
only
in
looking
like
a
beaming
cherub
tell
us
who
wrote
the
on
intimations
of
immortality
from
recollections
of
early
childhood
cripes
what
a
title
freddy
groaned
i
know
that
wadsworth
wrote
it
but
that
is
all
that
i
do
know
about
it
wordsworth
freddy
carl
corrected
him
wordsworth
henry
w
wordsworth
gee
carl
thanks
i
thought
it
was
william
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
and
then
pudge
explained
it
is
william
freddy
do
let
peters
razz
you
just
for
that
carl
you
tell
what
it
about
no
soap
said
carl
decisively
i
know
hugh
announced
excited
and
pleased
shoot
well
it
this
reincarnation
business
wordsworth
thought
you
lived
before
you
came
on
to
this
earth
and
everything
was
fine
when
you
were
a
baby
but
it
got
worse
when
you
got
older
that
about
all
it
kinda
bugs
but
i
like
some
of
it
it
is
bugs
pudge
contradicted
flatly
it
got
sense
you
do
lose
something
as
you
grow
older
but
you
gain
something
too
wordsworth
admits
that
it
a
wonderful
poem
and
you
dumbbells
if
you
see
it
he
was
very
serious
as
he
turned
the
pages
of
the
book
and
laid
his
pipe
on
the
table
at
his
elbow
now
listen
this
stanza
has
the
dope
for
the
whole
poem
he
read
the
famous
stanza
simply
and
effectively
our
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
forgetting
the
soul
that
rises
with
us
our
life
star
hath
had
elsewhere
its
setting
and
cometh
from
afar
not
in
entire
forgetfulness
and
not
in
utter
nakedness
but
trailing
clouds
of
glory
do
we
come
from
god
who
is
our
home
heaven
lies
about
us
in
our
infancy
shades
of
the
prison
house
begin
to
close
upon
the
growing
boy
but
he
beholds
the
light
and
whence
it
flows
he
sees
it
in
his
joy
the
youth
who
daily
farther
from
the
east
must
travel
still
is
nature
priest
and
by
the
vision
splendid
is
on
his
way
attended
at
length
the
man
perceives
it
die
away
and
fade
into
the
light
of
common
day
there
was
a
moment
silence
when
he
finished
and
then
hugh
said
reverently
that
is
beautiful
read
the
last
stanza
will
you
pudge
so
pudge
read
the
last
stanza
and
then
the
boys
got
into
an
argument
over
the
possible
truth
of
the
thesis
of
the
poem
freddy
finally
brought
them
back
to
the
task
in
hand
with
his
plaintive
plea
got
ta
get
going
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
the
seminar
broke
up
hugh
admitting
to
carl
after
their
visitors
departed
that
he
had
not
only
learned
a
lot
but
that
he
had
enjoyed
the
evening
heartily
the
college
grew
quieter
and
quieter
as
the
day
for
the
examinations
approached
there
were
seminars
on
everything
even
on
the
best
way
to
prepare
cribs
certain
students
with
low
grades
and
less
honor
would
somehow
gravitate
together
and
discuss
plans
for
foxing
the
profs
opinions
differed
one
man
usually
insisted
that
notes
in
the
palm
of
the
left
hand
were
safe
from
detection
only
to
be
met
by
the
objection
that
they
had
to
be
written
in
ink
and
if
one
hand
perspired
and
it
was
sure
as
hell
to
nothing
was
left
but
an
inky
smear
another
held
that
a
fellow
could
fasten
a
rubber
band
on
his
forearm
and
attach
the
notes
to
those
pulling
them
down
when
needed
and
then
letting
them
snap
back
out
of
sight
into
safety
but
one
of
the
conspirators
was
sure
to
object
what
th
hell
are
you
going
to
do
if
the
band
breaks
some
of
them
insisted
that
notes
placed
in
the
inside
of
one
goloshes
all
the
students
wore
them
but
took
them
off
in
the
could
be
easily
read
yeah
but
the
proctors
are
wise
to
that
stunt
and
so
eventually
all
the
stunts
were
used
and
many
more
not
that
all
the
students
cheated
everything
considered
the
percentage
of
cheaters
was
not
great
but
those
who
did
cheat
usually
spent
enough
time
evolving
ingenious
methods
of
preparing
cribs
and
in
preparing
them
to
have
learned
their
lessons
honestly
and
well
the
night
before
the
first
examinations
the
campus
was
utterly
quiet
suddenly
bedlam
broke
loose
somehow
every
dormitory
that
contained
freshmen
became
a
madhouse
at
the
same
time
hugh
and
carl
were
in
surrey
earnestly
studying
freddy
dickson
flung
the
door
open
and
shouted
hysterically
the
general
science
exam
out
hugh
and
carl
whirled
around
in
their
what
they
shouted
together
yeah
one
of
the
fellows
saw
it
a
girl
that
works
at
the
press
copied
down
the
exam
and
gave
it
to
him
what
fellow
where
the
exam
i
do
know
who
the
guy
is
but
hubert
manning
saw
the
exam
hugh
and
carl
were
out
of
their
chairs
in
an
instant
and
the
three
boys
rushed
out
of
surrey
in
search
of
manning
they
found
him
in
his
room
telling
a
mob
of
excited
classmates
that
he
had
seen
the
exam
but
that
harry
smithson
had
away
went
the
crowd
in
search
of
smithson
carl
and
hugh
and
freddy
in
the
midst
of
the
excited
chattering
lads
smithson
had
seen
the
exam
but
he
had
heard
that
puddy
mccumber
had
a
copy
freshmen
were
running
up
and
down
stairs
in
the
dormitories
shouting
have
you
seen
the
exam
no
nobody
had
seen
the
exam
but
some
of
the
boys
had
been
told
definitely
what
the
questions
were
going
to
be
no
two
seemed
to
agree
on
the
questions
but
everybody
copied
them
down
and
then
rushed
on
to
search
for
a
copy
they
hurried
from
dormitory
to
dormitory
constantly
shouting
the
same
question
have
you
seen
the
exam
there
were
men
in
every
dormitory
with
a
new
list
of
questions
which
were
hastily
scratched
into
by
the
eager
seekers
until
midnight
the
excitement
raged
then
the
campus
quieted
down
as
the
freshmen
began
to
study
the
long
lists
of
questions
god
said
carl
as
he
scanned
his
list
hopelessly
these
damn
questions
cover
everything
in
the
course
and
some
things
that
i
know
damn
well
were
in
it
what
a
lot
of
nuts
we
were
let
go
to
bed
carl
hugh
wailed
despondently
i
going
to
flunk
that
exam
i
answer
a
tenth
of
these
questions
i
ca
go
to
bed
i
got
to
study
oh
lord
do
be
a
jackass
come
on
to
bed
you
just
get
woozy
if
you
stay
up
any
longer
all
right
hugh
agreed
wearily
he
went
to
bed
but
many
of
the
boys
stayed
up
and
studied
some
of
them
all
night
the
examinations
were
held
in
the
gymnasium
hundreds
of
chairs
were
set
in
even
rows
nothing
else
was
there
not
even
the
gymnasium
apparatus
a
few
years
earlier
a
wily
student
had
sneaked
into
the
gymnasium
the
night
before
an
examination
and
written
his
notes
on
a
dumbbell
hanging
on
the
wall
the
next
day
he
calmly
chose
the
seat
in
front
of
the
dumbbell
and
proceeded
to
write
a
perfect
examination
the
annotated
dumbbell
was
found
later
and
after
that
the
walls
were
stripped
clean
of
apparatus
before
the
examinations
began
at
a
few
minutes
before
nine
the
entire
freshman
class
was
grouped
before
the
doors
of
the
gymnasium
nervously
talking
some
of
them
glancing
through
their
notes
others
smoking
some
of
them
so
rapidly
that
the
cigarettes
seemed
to
melt
others
walking
up
and
down
muttering
and
mumbling
all
of
them
so
excited
so
tense
that
they
hardly
knew
what
they
were
doing
hugh
was
trying
to
think
of
a
dozen
answers
to
questions
that
popped
into
his
head
and
he
could
think
of
anything
suddenly
the
doors
were
thrown
open
yelling
shoving
each
other
about
fairly
dancing
in
their
eagerness
and
excitement
the
freshmen
rushed
into
the
gymnasium
hugh
broke
from
the
mob
as
quickly
as
possible
hurried
to
a
chair
and
snatched
up
a
copy
of
the
examination
that
was
lying
on
its
broad
arm
at
the
first
glance
he
thought
that
he
could
answer
all
the
questions
a
second
glance
revealed
four
that
meant
nothing
to
him
for
a
moment
he
was
dizzy
with
hope
and
despair
and
then
all
at
once
he
felt
quite
calm
he
pulled
off
his
goloshes
and
prepared
to
go
to
work
within
three
minutes
the
noise
had
subsided
there
was
a
rustling
as
the
boys
took
off
their
coats
and
goloshes
but
after
that
there
was
no
sound
save
the
slow
steps
of
the
proctors
pacing
up
and
down
the
aisle
once
hugh
looked
up
thinking
desperately
almost
seizing
an
idea
that
floated
nebulous
and
necessary
before
him
a
proctor
that
he
knew
caught
his
eye
and
smiled
fatuously
hugh
did
not
smile
back
he
could
have
cried
in
his
fury
the
idea
was
gone
forever
some
of
the
students
began
to
write
immediately
some
of
them
leaned
back
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
some
of
them
chewed
their
pencils
nervously
some
of
them
leaned
forward
mercilessly
pounding
a
knee
some
of
them
kept
running
one
or
both
hands
through
their
hair
some
of
them
wrote
a
little
and
then
paused
to
gaze
blankly
before
them
or
to
tap
their
teeth
with
a
pen
or
pencil
all
of
them
were
concentrating
with
an
intensity
that
made
the
silence
electric
that
proctor
idiotic
smile
had
thrown
hugh
thoughts
into
what
seemed
hopeless
confusion
but
a
small
incident
almost
immediately
brought
order
and
relief
the
gymnasium
cat
was
wandering
around
the
rear
of
the
gymnasium
it
attracted
the
attention
of
several
of
the
students
and
of
a
proctor
being
very
careful
not
to
make
any
noise
he
picked
up
the
cat
and
started
for
the
door
almost
instantly
every
student
looked
up
and
then
the
stamping
began
four
hundred
freshmen
stamped
in
rhythm
to
the
proctor
steps
he
hushed
violently
tried
vainly
to
look
unconcerned
and
finally
disappeared
through
the
door
with
the
cat
hugh
had
stamped
lustily
and
laughed
in
great
glee
at
the
proctor
confusion
then
he
returned
to
his
work
completely
at
ease
his
nervousness
gone
one
hour
passed
two
hours
still
the
freshmen
wrote
still
the
proctors
paced
up
and
down
suddenly
a
proctor
paused
stared
intently
at
a
youth
who
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
walked
quickly
to
him
and
picked
up
one
of
his
goloshes
the
next
instant
he
had
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
was
walking
down
the
gymnasium
after
beckoning
to
the
boy
to
follow
him
the
boy
shoved
his
feet
into
his
goloshes
pulled
on
his
coat
and
his
face
white
and
strained
marched
down
the
aisle
the
proctor
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
at
the
door
he
nodded
opened
the
door
left
the
gymnasium
and
five
hours
later
the
college
thus
the
college
for
ten
days
the
better
students
moderately
calm
the
others
cramming
information
into
aching
heads
drinking
unbelievable
quantities
of
coffee
sitting
up
many
of
them
all
night
attending
seminars
or
tutoring
sessions
working
for
long
hours
in
the
library
finally
taking
the
examination
only
to
start
a
new
grind
in
preparation
for
the
next
one
if
a
student
failed
in
a
course
he
received
a
flunk
notice
from
the
registrar
office
within
four
days
after
the
examination
so
that
four
days
after
the
last
examination
every
student
knew
whether
he
had
passed
his
courses
or
not
all
those
who
failed
to
pass
three
courses
were
as
the
students
put
it
flunked
out
or
as
the
registrar
put
it
their
connection
with
the
college
was
severed
some
of
the
flunkees
took
the
news
very
casually
packed
their
trunks
sold
their
furniture
and
departed
others
frankly
wept
or
hastened
to
their
instructors
to
plead
vainly
that
their
grades
be
raised
all
of
them
were
required
to
leave
haydensville
at
once
hugh
passed
all
of
his
courses
but
without
distinction
his
b
in
trigonometry
did
not
give
him
great
satisfaction
inasmuch
as
he
had
received
an
a
in
exactly
the
same
course
in
high
school
nor
was
he
particularly
proud
of
his
b
in
english
since
he
knew
that
with
a
little
effort
he
could
have
pulled
an
a
the
remainder
of
his
grades
were
c
and
d
mostly
d
he
felt
almost
as
much
ashamed
as
freddy
dickson
who
somehow
had
got
going
and
had
been
flunked
out
carl
received
nothing
less
than
a
c
and
his
record
made
hugh
more
ashamed
of
his
own
carl
never
seemed
to
study
but
he
had
disgraced
himself
hugh
spent
many
bitter
hours
thinking
about
his
record
what
would
his
folks
think
worse
what
would
they
finally
he
wrote
to
them
dear
mother
and
dad
i
have
just
found
out
my
grades
i
think
that
they
will
be
sent
to
you
later
well
i
did
flunk
out
but
my
record
is
so
hot
only
two
of
my
grades
are
any
good
i
got
a
b
in
english
and
math
but
the
others
are
all
and
d
i
know
that
you
will
be
ashamed
of
me
and
awfully
sorry
i
thought
of
lots
of
excuses
to
write
to
you
but
i
guess
i
wo
write
them
i
know
that
i
did
study
hard
enough
i
had
too
much
fun
i
promise
you
that
i
do
better
next
time
i
know
that
i
can
please
do
scold
me
lots
of
love
hugh
all
that
his
mother
wrote
in
reply
was
of
course
you
will
do
better
next
time
the
kindness
hurt
dreadfully
hugh
wished
that
she
had
scolded
him
chapter
xii
the
college
granted
a
vacation
of
three
days
between
terms
but
hugh
did
not
go
home
nor
did
many
of
the
other
undergraduates
there
was
excitement
in
the
air
the
college
was
beginning
to
stew
and
boil
again
fraternity
rushing
was
scheduled
for
the
second
week
of
the
new
term
the
administration
strictly
prohibited
the
rushing
of
freshmen
the
first
term
and
in
general
the
fraternities
respected
the
rule
true
the
fraternity
men
were
constantly
visiting
eligible
freshmen
chatting
with
them
discussing
everything
with
them
except
fraternities
that
subject
was
barred
hugh
and
carl
received
a
great
many
calls
from
the
first
term
and
hugh
had
been
astonished
at
carl
reticence
and
silence
carl
the
flippant
the
voluble
the
lost
his
tongue
the
minute
a
man
wearing
a
fraternity
pin
entered
the
room
hugh
was
forced
to
entertain
the
guest
carl
never
explained
how
much
he
wanted
to
make
a
good
fraternity
not
any
fraternity
only
a
one
nor
did
he
explain
that
his
secret
studying
the
first
term
had
been
inspired
by
his
eagerness
to
be
completely
eligible
a
good
fraternity
would
put
the
seal
of
aristocracy
on
him
it
would
mean
everything
to
the
old
lady
for
the
first
three
nights
of
the
rushing
season
the
fraternities
held
open
house
for
all
freshmen
but
during
the
last
three
nights
no
freshman
was
supposed
to
enter
a
fraternity
house
unless
invited
the
first
three
nights
found
the
freshmen
traveling
in
scared
groups
from
fraternity
house
to
fraternity
house
sticking
close
together
unless
rather
vigorously
pried
apart
by
their
hosts
everybody
was
introduced
to
everybody
else
everybody
tried
rather
hopelessly
to
make
conversation
and
nearly
everybody
smoked
too
much
partly
because
they
were
nervous
and
partly
because
the
smokes
were
free
it
was
the
last
three
nights
that
counted
both
hugh
and
carl
received
invitations
from
most
of
the
fraternities
and
they
stuck
together
religiously
visiting
them
all
hugh
hoped
that
they
would
make
the
same
fraternity
and
that
that
fraternity
would
be
nu
delta
they
were
together
so
consistently
during
the
rushing
period
that
the
story
went
around
the
campus
that
carver
and
peters
were
going
the
same
way
and
that
carver
had
said
that
he
would
accept
a
bid
from
any
fraternity
unless
it
asked
peters
too
hugh
heard
the
story
and
could
understand
it
everybody
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
would
be
bid
why
did
they
take
it
equally
for
granted
that
carl
would
be
bid
as
well
he
thought
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
an
athlete
and
carl
was
but
the
truth
was
of
course
that
the
perceived
the
quality
in
carl
quite
as
clearly
as
he
did
himself
he
knew
that
his
money
and
the
fact
that
he
had
gone
to
a
fashionable
prep
school
would
bring
him
bids
but
would
they
be
from
the
right
fraternities
that
was
the
question
those
last
three
days
of
rushing
were
at
night
the
invited
freshmen
and
that
meant
about
two
thirds
of
the
class
were
at
the
fraternity
houses
until
eleven
between
classes
and
during
every
free
hour
they
were
accosted
by
earnest
fraternity
men
each
presenting
the
superior
merits
of
his
fraternity
the
fraternity
men
were
wearier
than
the
freshmen
they
sat
up
until
the
small
hours
every
morning
discussing
the
freshmen
they
had
entertained
the
night
before
hugh
was
in
a
daze
over
and
over
he
heard
the
same
words
with
only
slight
variations
a
fraternity
man
would
slap
a
fat
book
with
an
excited
hand
and
exclaim
this
is
manual
the
final
authority
on
fraternities
and
it
got
absolutely
all
the
dope
you
can
see
where
we
stand
sixty
chapters
you
do
join
just
this
one
y
understand
you
join
all
of
you
welcome
wherever
you
go
or
if
the
number
of
chapters
happened
to
be
small
baird
manual
was
referred
to
again
only
fifteen
chapters
you
see
we
do
take
in
new
chapters
every
time
they
ask
we
darned
careful
to
know
what
we
signing
up
before
we
take
anybody
in
the
word
aristocratic
was
carefully
avoided
but
it
was
just
as
carefully
suggested
it
seemed
to
hugh
that
he
was
shown
a
photograph
of
every
fraternity
house
in
the
country
look
he
would
be
told
by
his
host
look
at
that
picture
to
the
right
of
the
fireplace
that
our
house
at
cornell
is
it
the
darb
and
look
at
that
one
it
our
house
at
california
some
palace
they
got
sunken
gardens
i
was
out
there
last
year
to
our
convention
the
boys
certainly
gave
us
a
swell
time
all
this
through
a
haze
of
tobacco
smoke
and
over
the
noise
of
a
jazz
orchestra
and
the
chatter
of
a
dozen
similar
conversations
hugh
was
excited
but
not
really
interested
the
nu
deltas
invited
him
to
their
house
every
evening
but
they
were
not
making
a
great
fuss
over
him
perhaps
they
were
going
to
give
him
a
bid
well
he
go
some
other
fraternity
no
he
would
either
maybe
the
nu
delta
would
bid
him
later
after
he
done
something
on
the
track
although
actual
pledging
was
not
supposed
to
be
done
until
saturday
night
hugh
was
receiving
what
amounted
to
bids
all
that
day
and
the
night
before
several
times
groups
of
fraternity
men
got
into
a
room
closed
the
door
and
then
talked
to
him
until
he
was
almost
literally
dizzy
he
was
wise
enough
not
to
make
any
promises
his
invariable
answer
was
i
do
know
yet
i
wo
know
until
saturday
night
carl
was
having
similar
experiences
but
neither
of
them
had
been
talked
to
by
nu
deltas
the
president
of
the
chapter
merle
douglas
had
said
to
hugh
in
passing
we
got
our
eye
on
you
carver
and
that
was
all
that
had
been
said
carl
did
not
have
even
that
much
consolation
but
he
was
so
much
interested
in
nu
delta
as
hugh
was
kappa
zeta
or
alpha
sigma
would
do
as
well
both
of
these
fraternities
were
making
violent
efforts
to
get
hugh
but
they
were
paying
only
polite
attention
to
carl
on
friday
night
hugh
was
given
some
advice
that
he
had
good
reason
to
remember
in
later
years
at
the
moment
it
did
not
interest
him
a
great
deal
he
had
gone
to
the
delta
sigma
delta
house
not
because
he
had
the
slightest
interest
in
that
fraternity
but
because
the
nu
deltas
had
not
urged
him
to
remain
with
them
the
delta
sigma
deltas
welcomed
him
enthusiastically
and
turned
him
over
to
their
president
malcolm
graham
a
tall
serious
senior
with
sandy
hair
and
quiet
brown
eyes
will
you
come
with
me
carver
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
he
said
simply
hugh
hesitated
he
did
mind
being
talked
but
he
was
heartily
sick
of
being
talked
graham
noticed
his
hesitation
and
smiled
do
worry
i
not
going
to
shanghai
you
and
i
not
going
to
jaw
you
to
death
either
hugh
smiled
in
response
i
glad
of
that
he
said
wearily
i
been
jawed
until
i
do
know
anything
i
do
doubt
it
come
on
let
get
away
from
this
racket
he
took
hugh
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
his
own
room
which
was
pleasantly
quiet
and
restful
after
the
noise
they
had
left
when
they
were
both
seated
in
comfortable
chairs
graham
began
to
talk
i
know
that
you
are
being
tremendously
rushed
carver
and
i
know
that
you
are
going
to
get
a
lot
of
bids
too
i
been
watching
you
all
through
this
week
and
you
seem
dazed
and
confused
to
me
more
confused
even
than
the
average
freshman
i
think
i
know
the
reason
what
is
it
hugh
demanded
eagerly
i
understand
that
your
father
is
a
nu
delt
hugh
nodded
and
you
afraid
that
they
are
going
to
bid
you
hugh
was
startled
how
did
you
know
he
never
thought
of
denying
the
statement
i
guessed
it
you
were
obviously
worried
you
visited
other
fraternities
and
you
did
seem
to
enjoy
the
attention
that
you
were
getting
i
tell
you
right
now
that
you
are
worrying
about
nothing
the
nu
delts
will
bid
you
they
are
just
taking
you
for
granted
all
you
are
a
legacy
and
you
have
accepted
all
their
invitations
to
come
around
if
you
had
stayed
away
one
night
there
would
have
been
a
whole
delegation
rushing
around
the
campus
to
hunt
you
up
hugh
relaxed
for
the
time
being
he
believed
graham
implicitly
now
graham
went
on
it
the
nu
delts
that
i
want
to
talk
about
oh
i
not
going
to
knock
them
he
hastened
to
add
as
hugh
eyed
him
suspiciously
i
know
that
you
have
heard
plenty
of
fraternities
knocking
each
other
but
i
am
sure
that
you
have
heard
any
knocking
in
this
house
no
i
have
hugh
admitted
well
you
are
going
to
either
the
nu
delts
are
much
more
important
than
we
are
they
are
stronger
locally
and
they
got
a
very
powerful
national
organization
but
i
do
think
that
you
have
a
very
clear
notion
about
the
nu
delts
or
us
or
any
other
fraternity
i
heard
you
talking
about
fraternities
the
other
night
and
if
you
will
forgive
me
for
being
awfully
frank
you
were
talking
a
lot
of
nonsense
hugh
leaned
forward
eagerly
he
was
offended
and
for
the
first
time
that
week
he
did
feel
that
he
was
being
rushed
well
you
have
a
lot
of
sentimental
notions
about
fraternities
that
are
all
bull
that
all
you
think
that
the
brothers
are
really
brothers
that
they
stick
by
each
other
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
seem
to
think
too
that
the
fraternities
are
democratic
they
are
or
there
would
be
any
fraternities
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
fraternities
are
among
other
things
political
organizations
fighting
each
other
on
the
campus
for
dear
life
you
heard
fraternities
this
week
knocking
each
other
well
about
nine
tenths
of
what
been
said
is
either
lies
or
true
of
every
fraternity
on
the
campus
these
fraternities
are
working
together
for
the
good
of
sanford
working
like
hell
to
ruin
each
other
you
think
that
you
are
going
to
like
every
man
in
the
fraternity
you
join
you
wo
you
hate
some
of
them
hugh
was
aroused
and
indignant
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
why
do
you
stay
in
a
fraternity
graham
smiled
gravely
do
get
angry
please
i
stay
because
the
fraternity
has
its
virtues
as
well
as
its
faults
i
hated
the
fraternity
the
first
two
years
and
i
afraid
that
you
going
to
too
you
see
i
had
the
same
sort
of
notions
you
have
and
it
hurt
like
the
devil
when
they
were
knocked
into
a
cocked
hat
the
fraternity
is
a
pleasant
club
it
gets
you
into
campus
activities
and
it
gives
you
a
social
life
in
college
that
you
ca
get
without
it
it
is
very
important
to
most
men
after
they
graduate
just
try
to
raise
some
money
from
the
alumni
some
time
and
you
find
out
some
of
them
remain
undergraduates
all
their
lives
and
they
think
that
the
fraternity
is
important
but
most
of
them
hardly
think
of
it
except
when
they
come
back
to
reunions
they
more
interested
in
their
clubs
or
the
masons
or
something
of
that
sort
my
father
has
remained
an
undergraduate
all
his
life
but
interested
in
the
nu
delts
hugh
countered
vigorously
i
suppose
he
is
graham
tactfully
admitted
but
you
find
that
most
men
are
but
that
does
matter
you
are
an
alumnus
yet
you
a
freshman
and
a
fraternity
is
a
darn
nice
thing
to
have
around
while
you
are
in
college
what
i
am
going
to
say
now
he
continued
hesitating
is
pretty
touchy
and
i
hope
that
you
wo
be
offended
i
have
been
trying
to
impress
on
you
that
the
fraternity
is
most
important
while
you
are
in
college
and
believe
me
it
damned
important
a
fellow
has
a
hell
of
a
time
if
he
gets
into
the
wrong
fraternity
i
am
sure
that
you
are
going
to
get
a
lot
of
bids
do
choose
hastily
spend
thinking
the
various
bunches
over
and
choose
the
one
that
has
the
fellows
that
you
like
best
no
matter
what
its
standing
on
the
campus
is
be
sure
that
you
like
the
fellows
that
is
we
want
you
to
come
to
us
i
think
that
you
would
fit
in
here
but
i
am
not
going
to
urge
you
think
us
over
if
you
like
us
accept
our
bid
if
you
do
go
some
fraternity
where
you
do
like
the
fellows
and
that
my
warning
about
the
nu
delts
be
sure
that
you
like
the
fellows
or
most
of
them
anyway
before
you
accept
their
bid
have
you
thought
them
over
no
hugh
admitted
i
have
he
did
like
graham
talk
he
thought
that
it
was
merely
very
clever
rushing
he
did
graham
an
injustice
graham
had
been
strongly
attracted
to
hugh
and
felt
sure
that
he
would
be
making
a
serious
mistake
if
he
joined
nu
delta
hugh
reaction
however
was
natural
he
had
been
rushed
in
dozens
of
ingenious
ways
for
a
week
he
had
little
reason
therefore
to
trust
graham
or
anybody
else
graham
stood
up
i
have
a
feeling
carver
he
said
slowly
that
i
have
flubbed
this
talk
i
am
sure
that
you
know
some
day
that
i
was
really
disinterested
and
wanted
to
do
my
best
for
you
hugh
was
softened
and
smiled
shyly
as
he
lifted
himself
out
of
his
chair
i
know
you
did
he
said
with
more
gratitude
in
his
voice
than
he
quite
felt
and
i
very
grateful
but
i
so
woozy
now
that
i
do
know
what
to
think
i
do
wonder
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
too
i
have
got
to
bed
earlier
than
three
any
night
this
week
and
right
now
i
hardly
care
if
we
pledge
anybody
night
he
continued
talking
as
they
walked
slowly
down
the
stairs
one
more
bit
of
advice
do
go
anywhere
else
go
home
to
bed
and
think
over
what
i
told
you
and
he
added
holding
out
his
hand
even
if
you
come
our
way
i
hope
i
see
a
lot
of
you
before
the
end
of
the
term
hugh
clasped
his
hand
you
sure
will
thanks
a
lot
good
night
good
night
hugh
did
go
straight
to
his
room
and
tried
to
think
but
the
effort
met
with
little
success
he
wanted
desperately
to
receive
a
bid
from
nu
delta
and
if
he
did
well
nothing
else
much
mattered
assertion
that
nu
delta
would
bid
him
no
longer
brought
him
any
comfort
why
should
graham
know
what
nu
delta
was
going
to
do
shortly
after
eleven
carl
came
in
and
threw
himself
wearily
into
a
chair
for
a
few
minutes
neither
boy
said
anything
they
stared
into
the
fire
and
frowned
finally
carl
spoke
i
can
go
alpha
sig
if
i
want
he
said
softly
hugh
looked
up
good
he
exclaimed
honestly
pleased
but
i
hope
we
can
both
go
nu
delt
did
they
come
right
out
and
bid
you
er
no
not
exactly
it
kinda
funny
carl
obviously
wanted
to
tell
something
and
did
know
how
to
go
about
it
what
do
you
mean
what
happened
carl
shifted
around
in
his
chair
nervously
filled
his
pipe
lighted
it
and
then
forgot
to
smoke
well
he
began
slowly
morton
you
know
that
alpha
sig
clem
morton
the
senior
well
he
got
me
off
into
a
corner
and
talked
to
me
quite
a
while
shot
me
a
heavy
line
of
dope
at
first
i
did
get
him
at
all
he
was
talking
about
how
they
needed
new
furniture
and
that
sort
of
thing
finally
i
got
him
it
like
this
well
this
way
they
need
money
oh
hell
hugh
do
you
see
they
want
money
and
they
know
i
got
it
all
i
got
to
do
is
to
let
them
know
that
i
make
the
chapter
a
present
of
a
thousand
or
two
after
initiation
and
i
can
be
an
alpha
sig
hugh
was
sitting
tensely
erect
and
staring
at
carl
dazedly
you
mean
he
asked
slowly
that
they
want
you
to
buy
your
way
in
carl
gave
a
short
hard
laugh
well
nobody
said
anything
vulgar
like
that
hugh
but
you
got
the
big
idea
the
dirty
pups
the
goddamn
stinkers
i
hope
you
told
morton
to
go
straight
to
hell
hugh
jumped
up
and
stood
over
carl
excitedly
keep
your
shirt
on
hugh
no
i
did
tell
him
to
go
to
hell
i
say
anything
but
i
know
that
all
i
got
to
do
to
get
an
alpha
sig
bid
night
is
to
let
morton
know
that
i
like
to
make
the
chapter
a
present
and
i
not
sure
but
i
think
maybe
i
do
it
what
hugh
cried
you
would
carl
you
know
damn
well
you
would
he
was
almost
pleading
hey
quit
yelling
and
sit
down
he
got
up
shoved
hugh
back
into
his
chair
and
then
sat
down
again
i
want
to
make
one
of
the
big
three
i
got
to
i
do
believe
that
either
nu
delt
or
kappa
zete
is
going
to
bid
me
see
this
is
my
only
chance
and
i
think
that
i
going
to
take
it
he
spoke
deliberately
staring
pensively
into
the
fire
i
do
see
how
you
can
even
think
of
such
a
thing
hugh
said
in
painful
wonderment
why
i
rather
never
join
a
fraternity
than
buy
myself
into
one
you
are
me
no
i
not
you
listen
carl
hugh
turned
in
his
chair
and
faced
carl
who
kept
his
eyes
on
the
dying
fire
i
going
to
say
something
awfully
mean
but
i
hope
you
wo
get
mad
you
remember
you
told
me
once
that
you
were
a
gentleman
i
did
believe
you
but
if
you
buy
yourself
into
that
that
bunch
of
of
i
i
oh
hell
carl
i
have
to
believe
it
he
was
painfully
embarrassed
very
much
in
earnest
and
dreadfully
unhappy
i
told
you
that
i
was
a
gentleman
carl
said
sullenly
now
you
know
it
i
do
know
anything
of
the
sort
i
never
believe
that
you
could
do
such
a
thing
he
stood
up
again
and
leaned
over
carl
putting
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
listen
carl
he
said
soberly
earnestly
i
promise
that
i
wo
go
nu
delt
or
any
other
fraternity
unless
they
take
you
too
if
you
promise
me
not
to
go
alpha
sig
carl
looked
up
wonderingly
what
he
exclaimed
you
turn
down
nu
delt
if
they
do
bid
me
too
yes
nu
delt
or
kappa
zete
or
any
other
bunch
promise
me
he
urged
promise
me
carl
understood
the
magnitude
of
the
sacrifice
offered
and
his
eyes
became
dangerously
soft
god
you
white
hugh
he
whispered
huskily
white
as
hell
you
go
nu
delt
if
they
ask
you
but
i
promise
you
that
i
wo
go
alpha
sig
even
if
they
bid
me
without
pay
he
held
out
his
hand
and
hugh
gripped
it
hard
i
promise
he
repeated
on
my
word
of
honor
at
seven
saturday
evening
every
freshman
who
had
any
reason
at
all
to
think
that
he
would
get
a
bid
and
some
that
had
no
reason
collected
in
nervous
groups
in
the
of
the
union
at
the
stroke
of
seven
they
were
permitted
to
move
up
to
a
long
row
of
tables
which
were
covered
with
large
envelopes
one
for
every
freshman
they
were
arranged
in
alphabetical
order
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
each
man
found
the
one
addressed
to
him
some
of
the
envelopes
were
stuffed
with
cards
each
containing
the
freshman
name
and
the
name
of
the
fraternity
bidding
him
some
of
them
contained
only
one
or
two
cards
and
some
of
them
were
empty
the
boys
who
drew
empty
envelopes
instantly
left
the
union
without
a
word
to
anybody
the
others
tried
to
find
a
free
space
where
they
could
scan
their
cards
unobserved
they
were
all
wildly
excited
and
nervous
one
glance
at
the
cards
and
their
faces
either
lighted
with
joy
or
went
white
with
disappointment
hugh
found
ten
cards
in
his
envelope
and
one
of
them
had
nu
delta
written
on
it
his
heart
leaped
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
he
was
going
to
cry
then
he
rushed
around
the
union
looking
for
carl
he
found
him
staring
at
a
fan
of
cards
which
he
was
holding
like
a
hand
of
bridge
what
luck
hugh
cried
carl
handed
him
the
cards
lamp
those
he
said
and
then
explain
they
got
me
stopped
he
had
thirteen
bids
one
from
every
fraternity
in
good
standing
including
the
big
three
when
hugh
saw
the
nu
delta
card
he
yelled
with
delight
i
got
a
nu
delt
too
his
voice
was
trembling
with
excitement
go
with
me
wo
you
of
course
hugh
but
i
do
understand
oh
what
the
dif
let
go
he
tucked
his
arm
in
carl
and
the
two
of
them
passed
out
of
the
union
on
their
way
to
the
nu
delta
house
later
both
of
them
understood
carl
good
looks
his
excellent
clothes
his
money
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
to
an
expensive
preparatory
school
were
enough
to
insure
him
plenty
of
bids
even
if
he
had
been
considerably
less
of
a
gentleman
than
he
was
already
the
campus
was
ringing
with
shouts
as
freshmen
entered
fraternity
houses
each
freshman
being
required
to
report
at
once
to
the
fraternity
whose
bid
he
was
accepting
when
carl
and
hugh
walked
up
the
nu
delta
steps
they
were
seized
by
waiting
and
rushed
into
the
where
they
were
received
with
loud
cheers
slapped
on
the
back
and
passed
around
the
room
each
shaking
hands
with
them
so
vigorously
that
their
hands
hurt
for
an
hour
afterward
what
pleasant
pain
each
new
arrival
was
similarly
received
but
the
excitement
did
not
last
long
both
the
freshmen
and
the
were
too
tired
to
keep
the
enthusiasm
at
the
proper
pitch
at
nine
the
freshmen
were
sent
home
with
orders
to
report
the
next
evening
at
eight
carl
and
hugh
proudly
conscious
of
the
pledge
buttons
in
the
lapels
of
their
coats
walked
slowly
across
the
campus
spent
and
weary
but
exquisitely
happy
they
bid
me
on
account
of
you
carl
said
softly
they
did
think
they
could
get
you
unless
they
asked
me
too
no
hugh
replied
you
wrong
they
took
you
for
yourself
they
knew
you
would
go
where
i
did
and
they
were
sure
that
i
would
go
their
way
hugh
was
quite
right
the
nu
deltas
had
felt
sure
of
both
of
them
and
had
not
rushed
them
harder
because
they
were
too
busy
to
waste
any
time
on
certainties
carl
stopped
suddenly
god
hugh
he
exclaimed
just
suppose
i
had
offered
the
alpha
sigs
that
cash
god
are
you
glad
you
did
hugh
asked
happily
glad
glad
boy
i
and
he
added
softly
i
know
the
lad
i
got
to
thank
aw
go
to
hell
the
initiation
season
lasted
two
weeks
and
the
neophytes
found
that
the
dormitory
initiations
had
been
merely
child
play
they
had
to
account
for
every
hour
and
except
for
a
brief
time
allowed
every
day
for
studying
they
were
kept
busy
making
asses
of
themselves
for
the
delectation
of
the
in
the
nu
delta
house
a
freshman
had
to
be
on
guard
every
hour
of
the
day
up
to
midnight
he
was
forced
to
dress
himself
in
some
outlandish
costume
the
more
outlandish
the
better
and
announce
every
one
who
entered
or
left
the
house
standish
entering
he
would
bawl
or
kerwin
leaving
if
he
bawled
too
loudly
he
was
paddled
if
he
did
bawl
loudly
enough
he
was
paddled
and
if
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
with
his
bawling
he
was
paddled
anyway
every
freshman
had
to
supply
his
own
paddle
a
broad
stout
oak
affair
sold
at
the
cooperative
store
at
a
handsome
profit
if
a
freshman
reported
for
duty
one
minute
late
he
was
paddled
if
he
reported
one
minute
early
he
was
paddled
there
was
no
end
to
the
paddling
assume
the
angle
an
would
roar
the
unfortunate
freshman
then
humbly
bent
forward
gripped
his
ankles
with
his
hands
and
waited
the
worst
always
happened
the
brought
the
paddle
down
with
a
resounding
whack
on
the
seat
of
the
freshman
trousers
does
it
hurt
yes
sir
another
resounding
whack
no
no
sir
oh
well
if
it
does
hurt
i
might
as
well
give
you
another
one
and
he
gave
him
another
one
a
freshman
was
paddled
if
he
forgot
to
say
sir
to
an
he
was
paddled
if
he
neglected
to
touch
the
floor
with
his
fingers
every
time
he
passed
through
a
door
in
the
fraternity
house
he
was
paddled
if
he
laughed
when
an
told
a
joke
and
he
was
paddled
if
he
did
laugh
he
was
paddled
if
he
failed
to
return
from
an
errand
in
an
inconceivably
short
time
he
was
paddled
for
every
and
no
reason
but
mainly
because
the
the
sophomores
particularly
got
boundless
delight
out
of
doing
the
paddling
every
night
a
freshman
stood
on
the
roof
of
the
nu
delta
house
and
announced
the
time
every
fifteen
seconds
one
minute
and
fifteen
seconds
after
nine
and
all
well
in
the
halls
of
nu
delta
one
minute
and
thirty
seconds
after
nine
and
all
well
in
the
halls
of
nu
delta
one
minute
and
seconds
after
nine
and
all
well
in
the
halls
of
nu
delta
and
so
on
for
an
hour
then
he
was
relieved
by
another
freshman
who
took
up
the
chant
nightly
the
freshmen
had
to
entertain
the
and
if
the
entertainment
was
satisfactory
as
it
never
was
the
entertainers
were
paddled
they
had
to
run
races
shoving
pennies
across
the
floor
with
their
noses
the
winner
was
paddled
for
going
too
fast
did
he
have
any
sense
of
sportsmanship
and
the
loser
was
paddled
for
going
too
slow
most
of
the
freshmen
lost
skin
off
their
noses
and
foreheads
all
of
them
shivered
at
the
sight
of
a
paddle
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
they
were
whispering
to
each
other
how
many
blisters
they
had
on
their
buttocks
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
night
in
late
february
when
the
nu
deltas
took
the
freshmen
for
their
walk
they
drove
in
automobiles
fifteen
miles
into
the
country
and
then
left
the
freshmen
to
walk
back
it
was
four
in
the
morning
when
the
miserable
freshmen
reached
the
campus
half
frozen
unutterably
weary
but
thankful
that
the
end
of
the
initiation
was
at
hand
hugh
was
thankful
for
another
thing
the
nu
deltas
did
not
brand
he
had
noticed
several
men
in
the
with
tiny
greek
letters
branded
on
their
chests
or
thighs
the
branded
ones
seemed
proud
of
their
permanent
insignia
but
the
idea
of
a
fraternity
branding
its
members
like
was
repugnant
to
hugh
he
told
carl
that
he
was
darn
glad
the
nu
deltas
were
above
that
sort
of
thing
and
surprisingly
carl
agreed
with
him
the
next
night
they
were
formally
initiated
the
nu
delta
house
seemed
strangely
quiet
levity
was
strictly
prohibited
the
freshmen
were
given
white
robes
such
as
the
were
wearing
the
president
excepted
who
wore
a
really
handsome
robe
of
blue
and
silver
then
they
marched
to
the
goat
room
once
there
the
president
mounted
a
dais
a
brother
stood
on
each
side
of
him
hugh
was
so
much
impressed
by
the
ritual
the
black
hangings
of
the
room
the
fraternity
seal
over
the
dais
the
ornate
chandelier
the
long
speeches
of
the
president
and
his
assistants
that
he
failed
to
notice
that
many
of
the
brothers
were
openly
bored
eventually
each
freshman
was
led
forward
by
an
he
knelt
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
dais
and
repeated
after
the
president
the
oath
of
allegiance
then
one
of
the
assisting
brothers
whispered
to
him
the
password
and
taught
him
the
grip
a
secret
and
elaborate
method
of
shaking
hands
while
the
other
pinned
the
jeweled
pin
to
his
vest
when
each
freshman
had
been
received
into
the
fraternity
the
entire
chapter
marched
in
twos
singing
the
fraternity
song
the
initiation
was
over
carl
and
hugh
were
nu
delts
the
whole
ceremony
had
moved
hugh
deeply
so
deeply
that
he
had
hardly
been
able
to
repeat
the
oath
after
the
president
he
thought
the
ritual
very
beautiful
more
beautiful
even
than
the
easter
service
at
church
he
left
the
nu
delta
house
that
night
feeling
a
deeper
loyalty
for
the
fraternity
than
he
had
words
to
express
he
and
carl
walked
back
to
surrey
in
silence
neither
was
capable
of
speech
though
both
of
them
wanted
to
give
expression
to
their
emotion
in
some
way
they
reached
their
room
well
said
hugh
shyly
i
guess
i
go
to
bed
me
too
then
carl
moved
hesitatingly
to
where
hugh
was
standing
he
held
out
his
hand
and
grinned
but
his
eyes
were
serious
good
night
brother
their
hands
met
in
the
sacred
grip
good
night
brother
chapter
xiii
to
hugh
the
remainder
of
the
term
was
simply
a
fight
to
get
an
opportunity
to
study
the
old
saying
if
study
interferes
with
college
cut
out
study
did
not
appeal
to
him
he
honestly
wanted
to
do
good
work
but
he
found
that
the
chance
to
do
it
was
rare
some
one
always
seemed
to
be
in
his
room
eager
to
talk
there
was
the
fraternity
meeting
to
attend
every
monday
night
early
in
the
term
there
was
at
least
one
hockey
or
basketball
game
a
week
later
there
were
track
meets
baseball
games
and
tennis
matches
he
had
to
attend
glee
club
rehearsals
twice
a
week
he
ran
every
afternoon
either
in
the
gymnasium
or
on
the
cinder
path
some
one
always
seduced
him
into
going
to
the
movies
he
was
constantly
being
drawn
into
bull
sessions
there
was
an
occasional
concert
and
besides
all
these
distractions
there
was
a
fraternity
dance
the
excitement
of
prom
a
trip
to
three
cities
with
the
glee
club
and
finally
a
week
vacation
at
home
at
easter
worst
of
all
none
of
his
instructors
was
inspiring
he
had
been
assigned
to
a
new
section
in
latin
and
in
losing
alling
he
lost
the
one
really
enjoyable
teacher
he
had
had
the
others
were
conscientious
more
or
less
competent
but
there
was
little
enthusiasm
in
their
teaching
nothing
to
make
a
freshman
eager
either
to
attend
their
classes
or
to
study
the
lessons
they
assigned
they
did
not
make
the
acquiring
of
knowledge
a
thrilling
experience
they
made
it
a
duty
and
hugh
found
that
duty
exceedingly
irksome
he
attended
neither
the
fraternity
dance
nor
the
prom
he
had
looked
forward
enthusiastically
to
the
house
dance
but
after
he
had
along
with
the
other
men
in
his
delegation
cleaned
the
house
from
garret
to
basement
he
suddenly
took
to
his
bed
with
grippe
he
groaned
with
despair
when
carl
gave
him
glowing
accounts
of
the
dance
and
the
janes
carl
for
once
however
was
circumspect
he
did
not
tell
hugh
all
that
happened
he
would
have
been
hard
put
to
explain
his
own
reticence
but
although
he
thought
the
jane
who
got
had
been
enormously
funny
he
decided
not
to
tell
hugh
about
her
or
the
brothers
no
freshman
was
allowed
to
attend
the
prom
but
along
with
the
other
men
who
were
dragging
women
hugh
walked
the
streets
and
watched
the
girls
there
was
a
at
the
fraternity
house
during
prom
week
hugh
said
that
he
got
a
great
kick
out
of
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
remained
only
a
short
time
there
was
a
hectic
quality
to
both
the
girls
and
the
talk
that
confused
him
for
some
reason
he
did
like
the
atmosphere
and
he
did
know
why
his
excuse
to
the
brothers
and
to
himself
for
leaving
early
was
that
he
was
in
training
and
not
supposed
to
dance
track
above
all
things
was
absorbing
his
interest
he
could
hardly
think
of
anything
else
he
lay
awake
nights
dreaming
of
the
race
he
would
run
against
raleigh
sanford
had
three
dual
track
meets
a
year
but
the
first
two
were
with
small
colleges
and
considered
of
little
importance
only
a
point
winner
in
the
raleigh
meet
was
granted
his
letter
hugh
won
the
hundred
in
the
meet
and
in
a
meet
with
the
raleigh
freshmen
so
that
he
was
given
his
class
numerals
he
did
nothing
however
in
the
raleigh
meet
he
was
much
too
nervous
to
run
well
breaking
three
times
at
the
mark
he
was
set
back
two
yards
and
was
never
able
to
regain
them
for
a
time
he
was
bitterly
despondent
but
he
soon
cheered
up
when
he
thought
of
the
three
years
ahead
of
him
spring
brought
first
rain
and
slush
and
then
the
sings
there
was
a
fine
stretch
of
lawn
in
the
center
of
the
campus
and
on
clear
nights
the
students
gathered
there
for
a
sing
one
class
on
each
side
of
the
lawn
first
the
seniors
sang
a
college
song
then
the
juniors
then
the
sophomores
and
then
the
freshmen
after
each
song
the
other
classes
cheered
the
singers
except
when
the
sophomores
and
freshmen
sang
they
always
razzed
each
other
hugh
led
the
freshmen
and
he
never
failed
to
get
a
thrill
out
of
singing
a
clear
note
and
hearing
his
classmates
take
it
up
after
each
class
had
sung
three
or
four
songs
the
boys
gathered
in
the
center
of
the
lawn
sang
the
college
hymn
gave
a
cheer
and
the
sing
was
over
on
such
nights
however
the
singing
really
continued
for
hours
the
glee
club
often
sang
from
the
union
steps
groups
of
boys
wandered
arm
in
arm
around
the
campus
singing
on
every
fraternity
steps
there
were
youths
strumming
banjos
and
others
harmonizing
here
there
everywhere
young
voices
were
lifted
in
song
not
joyous
nor
jazzy
but
plaintive
and
sentimental
adeline
sweetness
was
extolled
by
unsure
barytones
and
whisky
tenors
and
the
charms
of
rosie
were
chanted
in
close
harmony
in
every
corner
of
the
campus
sweet
rosie
she
my
pretty
rose
she
my
pretty
lady
as
every
one
knows
and
when
we
are
married
oh
how
happy
we
be
for
i
love
sweet
rosie
and
rosie
loves
me
hugh
loved
those
nights
the
shadows
of
the
elms
the
soft
spring
moonlight
the
twanging
banjos
the
happy
singing
he
would
never
so
long
as
he
lived
hear
rosie
without
surrendering
to
a
tender
sentimental
mood
that
song
would
always
mean
the
campus
and
singing
youth
suddenly
examinations
threw
their
baleful
influence
over
the
campus
again
once
more
the
excitement
but
not
so
great
this
time
the
cramming
the
rumors
of
examinations
getting
out
the
seminars
the
tutoring
sections
the
nervousness
the
fear
hugh
however
was
surer
of
himself
than
he
had
been
the
first
term
and
although
he
had
no
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
grades
he
received
he
was
not
particularly
ashamed
of
them
he
and
carl
left
the
same
day
but
by
different
trains
they
had
agreed
to
room
together
again
in
surrey
so
they
did
feel
that
the
parting
for
the
summer
was
very
important
you
write
wo
you
old
man
sure
hugh
surest
thing
you
know
say
it
do
seem
possible
that
our
freshman
year
over
already
why
hell
hugh
we
sophomores
so
we
are
what
do
you
know
about
that
hugh
eyes
shone
gosh
carl
looked
at
his
watch
hell
i
got
to
beat
it
he
picked
up
his
dropped
it
shook
hands
vigorously
with
hugh
snatched
up
his
and
was
off
with
a
final
hugh
old
boy
sounding
behind
him
hugh
settled
back
into
a
chair
he
had
half
an
hour
to
wait
a
sophomore
gosh
chapter
xiv
hugh
spent
the
summer
at
home
working
on
the
farm
reading
a
little
and
occasionally
visiting
a
lake
summer
resort
a
few
miles
away
helen
had
left
merrytown
to
attend
a
secretarial
school
in
a
neighboring
city
and
hugh
was
genuinely
glad
to
find
her
gone
when
he
returned
from
college
helen
was
becoming
not
only
a
bore
but
a
problem
besides
he
met
a
girl
at
corley
lake
the
summer
resort
whom
he
found
much
more
fascinating
for
a
month
or
two
he
thought
that
he
was
in
love
with
janet
harton
night
after
night
he
drove
to
corley
lake
in
his
car
sometimes
dancing
with
janet
in
the
pavilion
sometimes
canoeing
with
her
on
the
lake
sometimes
taking
her
for
long
rides
in
the
car
but
often
merely
wandering
through
the
pines
with
her
or
sitting
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
staring
at
the
rippling
water
janet
was
small
and
delicate
she
seemed
almost
fragile
she
did
everything
daintily
like
a
little
girl
playing
her
hands
and
feet
were
exquisitely
small
her
features
childlike
and
indefinite
except
her
little
coral
mouth
which
was
as
clearly
outlined
with
color
as
a
doll
and
as
mobile
as
a
fluttering
leaf
she
had
wide
blue
eyes
and
hair
that
was
truly
golden
strangely
she
had
not
bobbed
it
but
wore
it
bound
into
a
shining
coil
around
her
head
hugh
wrote
a
poem
to
her
it
began
thus
maiden
with
the
clear
blue
eyes
lady
with
the
golden
hair
exquisite
child
serenely
wise
sweetly
tender
morning
fair
he
was
sure
that
it
was
a
very
good
poem
there
was
something
reminiscent
about
the
first
line
and
he
was
dubious
about
morning
fair
he
had
however
studied
german
for
a
year
in
high
school
and
he
guessed
that
if
was
all
right
in
german
it
was
all
right
in
english
too
they
rarely
talked
hugh
was
content
to
sit
for
hours
with
the
delicate
child
nestling
in
his
arm
her
hand
lying
passive
and
cool
in
his
she
made
him
feel
very
strong
and
protective
nights
he
dreamed
of
doing
brave
deeds
for
her
of
saving
her
from
terrible
dangers
at
first
her
vague
fleeting
kisses
thrilled
him
but
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
his
passion
grew
he
found
them
strangely
unsatisfying
when
she
cuddled
her
lovely
head
in
the
hollow
of
his
shoulder
he
would
lean
forward
and
whisper
kiss
me
janet
kiss
me
obediently
she
would
turn
her
face
upward
her
little
mouth
pursed
into
a
coral
bud
but
if
he
held
her
too
tightly
or
prolonged
the
kiss
she
pushed
him
away
or
turned
her
face
then
he
felt
repelled
chilled
she
kissed
him
much
as
she
kissed
her
mother
every
night
and
he
wanted
well
he
did
quite
know
what
he
did
want
except
that
he
did
want
to
be
kissed
way
finally
he
protested
what
the
matter
janet
he
asked
gently
do
you
love
me
of
course
she
answered
calmly
in
her
small
voice
of
course
i
love
you
but
you
are
so
rough
you
must
kiss
me
hard
like
that
it
is
nice
nice
hugh
felt
as
if
she
had
slapped
his
face
then
he
knew
that
she
did
understand
at
all
he
tried
to
excuse
her
by
telling
himself
that
she
was
just
a
child
she
was
within
a
year
of
his
own
age
and
that
she
would
love
him
the
way
he
did
her
when
she
grew
older
but
down
in
his
heart
he
sensed
the
fact
that
she
was
capable
of
love
that
she
merely
wanted
to
be
petted
and
caressed
as
a
child
did
the
shadows
and
the
moonlight
did
not
move
her
as
they
did
him
and
she
thought
that
he
was
silly
when
he
said
that
he
could
hear
a
song
in
the
night
breeze
she
had
said
that
his
poem
was
very
pretty
that
was
all
well
maybe
it
was
a
very
good
poem
but
it
had
well
it
had
it
had
something
in
it
that
was
just
pretty
he
began
to
visit
the
lake
less
often
and
to
wish
that
september
and
the
opening
of
college
would
arrive
when
the
day
finally
came
to
return
he
was
almost
as
much
excited
as
he
had
been
the
year
before
gosh
it
would
be
good
to
see
carl
again
the
bum
had
written
only
once
yeah
and
pudge
jamieson
too
and
larry
stillwell
and
bill
freeman
and
yes
by
golly
merton
billings
he
be
glad
to
see
old
fat
billings
he
wondered
if
merton
was
as
fat
as
ever
and
as
pure
and
all
the
brothers
at
the
nu
delta
house
he
been
too
busy
to
get
really
acquainted
with
them
last
year
but
this
year
by
gosh
he
get
to
know
all
of
them
it
certainly
would
be
great
to
be
back
and
be
a
sophomore
and
make
the
little
frosh
stand
around
he
did
carry
his
up
the
hill
this
time
he
checked
it
and
sent
a
freshman
for
it
later
when
he
arrived
at
surrey
carl
was
already
there
and
he
was
kneeling
before
a
trunk
when
hugh
walked
into
the
room
both
of
them
instantly
remembered
the
identical
scene
of
the
year
before
carl
jumped
to
his
feet
hullo
who
are
you
he
demanded
his
face
beaming
hugh
pretended
to
be
frightened
and
shy
i
hugh
carver
i
i
guess
i
going
to
room
with
you
you
sure
are
yelled
carl
jumping
over
the
trunk
and
landing
on
hugh
god
i
glad
to
see
you
put
it
there
they
shook
hands
and
stared
at
each
other
with
shining
eyes
then
they
began
to
talk
interrupting
each
other
gesticulating
occasionally
slapping
each
other
violently
on
the
back
or
knee
shouting
with
laughter
as
one
of
them
told
of
a
summer
experience
that
struck
them
as
funny
they
were
both
so
glad
to
get
back
to
college
so
glad
to
see
each
other
that
they
were
almost
hysterical
and
when
they
left
surrey
arm
in
arm
on
their
way
to
the
nu
delta
house
to
see
the
brothers
their
cup
of
bliss
was
full
to
the
brim
and
running
over
criminy
the
ol
campus
sure
does
look
good
said
hugh
ecstatically
watch
the
frosh
work
he
was
suddenly
reminded
of
something
hey
freshman
he
yelled
at
a
big
youngster
who
was
to
be
on
the
football
team
a
year
hence
the
freshman
came
on
a
run
yes
yes
sir
here
a
check
take
it
down
to
the
station
and
get
my
take
it
up
to
surrey
nineteen
and
put
it
in
the
room
the
door
open
hurry
up
now
i
going
to
want
it
pretty
soon
yes
sir
i
hurry
and
the
freshman
was
off
running
hugh
and
carl
grinned
at
each
other
linked
arms
again
and
continued
their
way
across
the
campus
when
they
entered
the
nu
delta
house
a
shout
went
up
hi
carl
hi
hugh
glad
to
see
you
back
didya
have
a
good
summer
put
it
there
ol
kid
and
they
shook
hands
gripping
each
other
forearm
at
the
same
time
hugh
tried
hard
to
become
a
typical
sophomore
and
failed
rather
badly
he
retained
much
of
the
shyness
and
diffidence
that
gives
the
freshman
his
charm
and
he
did
not
succeed
very
well
in
acquiring
the
swagger
the
cocky
patronizing
manner
the
raucous
that
characterize
the
true
sophomore
he
found
too
that
he
could
lord
it
over
the
freshmen
very
well
and
at
times
he
was
nothing
less
than
a
renegade
to
his
class
he
was
constantly
giving
freshmen
correct
information
about
their
problems
and
during
the
dormitory
initiations
he
more
than
once
publicly
objected
to
some
stunt
that
seemed
to
him
needlessly
insulting
to
the
initiates
because
he
was
an
athlete
his
opinion
was
respected
and
quite
unintentionally
he
won
several
good
friends
among
the
freshmen
his
objections
had
all
been
spontaneous
and
he
was
rather
sorry
about
them
afterward
he
felt
that
he
must
be
soft
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
stand
anything
that
anybody
else
could
further
he
felt
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
his
sense
of
humor
things
that
struck
lots
of
his
classmates
as
funny
seemed
merely
disgusting
to
him
he
wanted
very
much
to
tell
carl
about
janet
but
for
several
weeks
the
opportunity
did
not
present
itself
there
was
too
much
excitement
about
the
campus
the
mood
of
the
place
was
all
wrong
and
hugh
although
he
did
know
it
was
very
sensitive
to
moods
and
atmosphere
finally
one
night
in
october
he
and
carl
were
seated
in
their
big
chairs
before
the
fire
they
had
been
walking
that
afternoon
and
hugh
had
been
swept
outside
of
himself
by
the
brilliance
of
the
autumn
foliage
he
was
emotionally
and
physically
tired
feeling
that
vague
melancholy
happiness
that
comes
after
an
intense
but
pleasant
experience
carl
leaned
back
to
the
and
switched
off
the
study
light
pleasanter
with
just
the
firelight
he
said
quietly
he
too
had
something
that
he
wanted
to
tell
and
the
less
light
the
better
hugh
sighed
and
relaxed
comfortably
into
his
chair
the
shadows
were
thick
and
mysterious
behind
them
the
flames
leaped
merrily
in
the
fireplace
both
boys
sat
silent
staring
into
the
fire
finally
hugh
spoke
i
met
a
girt
this
summer
carl
he
said
softly
yeah
yeah
little
peach
pretty
dainty
you
know
dainty
like
a
little
kid
you
know
carl
had
slumped
down
into
his
chair
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
and
staring
pensively
at
the
flames
go
on
well
i
fell
pretty
hard
she
was
so
er
dainty
she
always
reminded
me
of
a
little
girl
playing
lady
she
had
golden
hair
and
blue
eyes
the
bluest
eyes
i
ever
seen
oh
lots
bluer
than
mine
lots
bluer
and
little
bits
of
hands
and
feet
carl
continued
to
puff
his
pipe
and
stare
at
the
fire
pet
he
asked
dreamily
yeah
she
petted
but
she
was
kinda
funny
cold
you
know
and
kinda
scared
gee
carl
i
was
crazy
about
her
i
i
even
wrote
her
a
poem
i
guess
it
was
very
good
but
i
do
think
she
knew
what
it
was
about
i
guess
i
off
her
now
though
she
too
cold
i
do
want
a
girl
to
fall
over
me
my
last
girl
did
that
but
golly
carl
janet
did
understand
i
do
think
she
knows
anything
about
love
some
of
do
carl
remarked
philosophically
slipping
deeper
into
his
chair
they
just
pet
that
the
way
she
was
she
liked
me
to
hold
her
and
kiss
her
just
as
long
as
i
acted
like
a
big
brother
but
criminy
when
i
felt
that
soft
little
thing
in
my
arms
i
did
feel
like
a
big
brother
i
loved
her
like
hell
she
was
awfully
sweet
he
added
regretfully
i
wish
she
was
so
cold
hard
luck
old
man
said
carl
consolingly
hard
luck
guess
you
picked
an
iceberg
for
a
few
minutes
the
room
was
quiet
except
for
the
crackling
of
the
fire
which
was
beginning
to
burn
low
the
shadows
were
creeping
up
on
the
boys
the
flames
were
less
merry
carl
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
drawled
softly
i
had
better
luck
hugh
pricked
up
his
ears
you
have
really
fallen
in
love
have
you
he
demanded
eagerly
carl
had
often
said
that
he
would
never
fall
in
love
that
he
was
too
wise
to
women
no
i
did
fall
in
love
nothing
like
that
i
met
a
bunch
of
janes
down
at
bar
harbor
some
of
them
i
known
before
but
i
met
some
new
ones
too
had
a
damn
good
time
some
of
those
janes
certainly
could
neck
and
they
were
ready
for
it
any
time
gee
if
the
old
lady
been
there
i
a
been
potted
about
half
the
time
as
it
was
i
drank
enough
gin
and
scotch
to
float
a
well
the
old
lady
had
to
go
to
new
york
on
account
of
some
business
so
i
went
down
to
christmas
cove
to
visit
some
people
i
know
there
christmas
cove
a
nice
place
not
so
as
bar
harbor
but
still
it
a
nice
place
hugh
felt
that
carl
was
leaving
the
main
track
and
he
hastened
to
shunt
him
back
sure
he
said
in
cheerful
agreement
sure
it
is
but
what
happened
what
happened
oh
oh
yes
carl
brought
himself
back
to
the
present
with
an
obvious
effort
sure
i
tell
you
what
happened
well
there
was
a
girl
there
named
elaine
marston
she
was
staying
with
the
folks
i
was
but
they
knew
her
so
i
saw
a
lot
of
her
see
sure
hugh
wished
he
would
hurry
up
carl
did
usually
wander
all
over
when
telling
a
story
this
must
be
something
special
well
i
saw
lots
of
her
lots
pretty
girl
nice
family
and
everything
but
she
liked
her
booze
and
she
liked
to
pet
awful
hot
kid
well
one
night
we
went
to
a
dance
and
between
dances
we
had
a
lot
of
gin
i
had
brought
with
me
good
stuff
too
i
bought
it
off
a
guy
who
brought
it
down
from
canada
himself
where
was
i
oh
yes
at
the
dance
we
both
got
i
was
all
liquored
up
and
i
guess
she
was
too
after
the
dance
was
over
i
dared
her
to
walk
over
to
south
bristol
that
just
across
the
island
you
know
and
then
walk
back
again
well
we
gone
far
when
we
decided
to
sit
down
we
were
both
kinda
dizzy
from
the
gin
you
have
to
go
through
the
woods
you
know
and
it
dark
as
hell
in
there
at
night
we
sat
down
among
some
ferns
and
i
began
to
pet
her
do
know
why
just
did
oh
hell
what
the
use
of
going
into
details
you
can
guess
what
happened
hugh
sat
suddenly
erect
you
did
carl
stood
up
and
stretched
yeah
he
yawned
i
did
it
lots
of
times
afterwards
hugh
was
dazed
he
did
know
what
to
think
for
an
instant
he
was
shocked
and
then
he
was
envious
wonder
if
janet
would
have
gone
the
whole
way
flitted
across
his
mind
he
instantly
dismissed
the
question
he
felt
that
it
was
fair
to
janet
but
carl
gosh
carl
yawned
again
great
stuff
he
said
nonchalantly
sleepy
as
hell
guess
i
hit
the
hay
he
eyed
hugh
suspiciously
you
are
shocked
are
you
you
do
think
i
a
moral
leper
or
anything
like
that
he
attempted
to
be
light
but
was
altogether
successful
of
course
not
hugh
denied
the
suggestion
vehemently
and
yet
down
in
his
heart
he
felt
a
keen
disappointment
he
hardly
knew
why
he
was
disappointed
but
he
was
going
to
bed
he
asked
as
casually
as
he
could
yeah
good
night
good
night
old
man
each
boy
went
to
his
own
bedroom
hugh
to
go
to
bed
and
think
story
over
it
thrilled
him
and
he
envied
carl
and
yet
and
yet
he
wished
carl
had
done
it
it
made
him
and
carl
different
sorta
not
the
same
no
that
was
it
he
did
know
just
what
the
trouble
was
but
there
was
a
sharp
sting
of
disillusionment
that
hurt
he
would
have
been
more
confused
had
he
known
what
was
happening
in
carl
room
carl
had
walked
into
his
own
bedroom
lighted
the
light
and
closed
the
door
then
he
walked
to
the
dresser
and
stared
at
himself
in
the
mirror
stared
a
long
time
as
if
the
face
were
somehow
new
to
him
there
was
a
picture
of
the
old
lady
on
the
dresser
it
caught
his
eye
and
he
flinched
it
seemed
to
look
at
him
reproachfully
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
he
thought
of
how
he
had
bluffed
hugh
he
had
cried
after
his
first
experience
with
the
girl
he
looked
again
into
the
mirror
you
goddamn
hypocrite
he
said
softly
you
goddamn
hypocrite
his
lip
curled
in
contempt
at
his
image
he
began
to
undress
rapidly
the
eyes
of
the
old
lady
in
the
picture
seemed
to
follow
him
around
the
room
the
thought
of
her
haunted
him
desperately
he
switched
out
the
light
once
in
bed
he
rolled
over
on
his
stomach
and
buried
his
face
in
the
pillow
god
he
whispered
god
chapter
xv
sanford
defeated
raleigh
this
year
in
football
and
for
a
time
the
college
was
wild
with
excitement
and
delight
most
of
the
free
lumber
in
haydensville
was
burned
in
a
triumphant
bonfire
and
many
of
the
undergraduates
celebrated
so
joyously
with
their
winnings
that
they
looked
sadly
bedraggled
for
several
days
afterward
the
victory
was
discussed
until
the
boys
were
thoroughly
sick
of
it
and
then
they
settled
down
to
a
normal
life
studying
playing
pool
billiards
and
cards
going
to
the
movies
reading
a
little
and
holding
bull
sessions
hugh
attended
many
bull
sessions
some
of
them
he
found
interesting
but
many
of
them
were
merely
orgies
of
filthy
talk
the
participants
vying
with
one
another
in
telling
the
dirtiest
stories
and
although
hugh
was
not
a
prig
he
was
offended
by
a
dirty
story
that
was
told
merely
for
the
sake
of
its
dirt
pudge
jamieson
stories
were
smutty
but
they
were
funny
too
and
he
could
send
hugh
into
paroxysms
of
laughter
any
time
that
he
chose
one
night
in
late
november
hugh
was
in
gordon
ross
room
in
surrey
along
with
four
others
ross
was
a
senior
a
quiet
man
with
gray
eyes
rather
heavy
features
and
soft
brown
hair
he
was
considerably
older
than
the
others
having
worked
for
several
years
before
he
came
to
college
he
listened
to
the
stories
that
were
being
told
occasionally
smiled
but
more
often
studied
the
group
curiously
the
talk
became
exceedingly
nasty
and
hugh
was
about
to
leave
in
disgust
when
the
discussion
suddenly
turned
serious
do
you
know
said
george
winsor
abruptly
i
wonder
why
we
hold
these
smut
sessions
i
sit
here
and
laugh
like
a
fool
and
am
ashamed
of
myself
half
the
time
and
this
is
the
only
smut
session
that
going
on
right
now
i
bet
there
thirty
at
least
going
on
around
the
campus
why
are
we
always
getting
into
little
groups
and
covering
each
other
with
filth
college
men
are
supposed
to
be
gentlemen
and
we
talk
like
a
lot
of
winsor
was
a
sophomore
a
fine
student
and
thoroughly
popular
he
looked
like
an
unkempt
airedale
his
clothes
even
when
new
never
looked
neat
and
his
rusty
hair
refused
to
lie
flat
he
had
an
eager
quick
way
about
him
and
his
brown
eyes
were
very
bright
and
lively
yes
that
what
i
want
to
know
hugh
chimed
in
forgetting
all
about
his
desire
to
leave
i
always
sitting
in
on
bull
sessions
but
i
think
they
re
rotten
about
every
so
often
i
make
up
my
mind
that
i
wo
take
part
in
another
one
and
before
i
know
it
somebody
telling
me
the
latest
and
i
listening
for
all
i
worth
that
easy
melville
burbank
answered
he
was
a
junior
with
a
brilliant
record
you
merely
sublimating
your
sex
instincts
all
if
you
played
around
with
cheap
women
more
you
would
be
thinking
about
sex
all
the
time
and
talking
smut
you
crazy
it
was
keith
nutter
talking
a
sophomore
notorious
for
his
dissipations
hell
i
out
with
bags
all
the
time
as
you
damn
well
know
my
sex
instincts
do
need
sublimating
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
i
talk
smut
as
much
as
anybody
more
than
some
perhaps
you
just
naturally
dirty
burbank
said
his
voice
edged
with
sarcasm
he
did
like
nutter
the
boy
seemed
gross
to
him
go
to
hell
i
no
dirtier
than
anybody
else
nutter
was
not
only
angry
but
frankly
hurt
the
only
difference
between
me
and
the
rest
of
you
guys
is
that
i
admit
that
i
chase
around
with
rats
and
the
rest
of
you
do
it
on
the
sly
i
no
hypocrite
oh
come
off
keith
gordon
ross
said
quietly
you
not
fair
i
admit
that
lots
of
the
fellows
are
chasing
around
with
rats
on
the
sly
but
lots
of
them
are
too
more
fellows
go
straight
around
this
college
than
you
think
i
know
a
number
that
have
never
touched
a
woman
they
just
hate
to
admit
they
pure
that
all
and
you
take
their
bluff
for
the
real
thing
you
got
to
show
me
nutter
was
almost
sullen
i
admit
that
i
no
angel
but
i
do
believe
that
i
a
damn
bit
worse
than
the
average
besides
what
wrong
about
it
anyhow
it
just
as
natural
as
eating
and
i
do
see
where
there
is
anything
worse
about
it
george
winsor
stood
up
and
leaned
against
the
mantel
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
until
it
stood
grotesquely
on
end
oh
that
the
old
argument
i
heard
it
debated
in
a
hundred
bull
sessions
one
fellow
says
it
all
wrong
and
another
fellow
says
it
all
right
and
you
never
get
anywhere
i
want
somebody
to
tell
me
what
wrong
about
it
and
what
right
god
knows
you
do
find
out
in
your
classes
they
have
doc
conners
give
those
smut
talks
to
us
in
our
freshman
year
and
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
good
they
do
a
bunch
of
fellows
faint
and
have
to
be
lugged
out
and
the
doc
gives
you
some
sickening
details
about
venereal
diseases
and
that
as
far
as
you
get
now
i
all
messed
up
about
this
sex
business
and
i
admit
that
i
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
too
some
fellows
say
it
all
right
to
have
a
woman
and
some
fellows
say
it
all
wrong
but
i
notice
none
of
them
have
any
use
for
a
woman
who
is
straight
all
of
the
boys
were
sitting
in
except
donald
ferguson
who
was
lying
on
the
couch
and
listening
in
silence
he
was
a
handsome
youth
with
scotch
blue
eyes
and
sandy
hair
women
were
instantly
attracted
by
his
good
looks
splendid
physique
slow
smile
and
quiet
drawl
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
the
old
fight
he
said
propping
his
head
on
his
hand
i
do
see
any
sense
in
scrapping
about
that
any
more
we
got
a
single
standard
now
the
girls
go
just
as
fast
as
the
fellows
oh
that
not
so
hugh
exclaimed
girls
do
go
as
far
as
fellows
ferguson
smiled
pleasantly
at
hugh
and
drawled
shut
up
innocent
you
do
know
anything
about
it
i
tell
you
the
old
double
standard
has
gone
all
to
hell
you
exaggerating
don
just
to
get
hugh
excited
ross
said
in
his
quiet
way
there
are
plenty
of
decent
girls
just
because
a
lot
of
them
pet
on
all
occasions
is
any
reason
to
say
that
they
are
straight
i
older
than
you
fellows
and
i
guess
i
had
a
lot
more
experience
than
most
of
you
i
had
to
make
my
own
way
since
i
was
a
kid
and
i
bumped
up
against
a
lot
of
rough
customers
i
worked
in
a
lumber
camp
for
a
year
and
after
you
been
with
a
gang
like
that
for
a
while
you
understand
the
difference
between
them
and
college
fellows
those
boys
are
bad
eggs
they
just
have
any
morals
all
they
turn
into
beasts
every
pay
night
and
bad
as
some
of
our
college
parties
are
they
are
a
circumstance
to
a
lumber
town
on
pay
night
that
no
argument
george
winsor
said
excitedly
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
gesticulating
with
it
just
because
a
lumberjack
is
a
beast
is
no
reason
that
a
college
man
is
all
right
because
he
less
of
a
beast
i
tell
you
i
get
sick
of
my
own
thoughts
and
i
get
sick
of
the
college
when
i
hear
about
some
things
that
are
done
i
keep
straight
and
i
do
know
why
i
do
i
despise
about
half
the
fellows
that
chase
around
with
rats
and
sometimes
i
envy
them
like
hell
well
what
the
sense
in
me
keeping
straight
what
the
sense
in
anybody
keeping
straight
fellows
that
do
seem
to
get
along
just
as
well
as
those
that
do
what
do
you
think
mel
you
been
reading
havelock
ellis
and
a
lot
of
ducks
like
that
burbank
tossed
a
cigarette
butt
into
the
fire
and
gazed
into
the
flames
for
a
minute
before
speaking
his
homely
face
serious
and
troubled
i
do
know
what
to
think
he
replied
slowly
ellis
tells
about
some
things
that
make
you
fairly
sick
so
does
forel
the
human
race
can
be
awfully
rotten
i
been
thinking
about
it
a
lot
and
i
all
mixed
up
sometimes
life
just
does
seem
worth
living
to
me
what
with
the
filth
and
the
slums
and
the
greed
and
everything
i
been
taking
a
course
in
sociology
and
some
of
the
things
that
prof
davis
has
been
telling
us
make
you
wonder
why
the
world
goes
on
at
all
some
poet
has
a
line
somewhere
about
man
inhumanity
to
man
and
i
find
myself
thinking
about
that
all
the
time
the
world
rotten
as
hell
and
i
do
see
how
anything
can
be
done
about
it
i
do
think
sometimes
that
it
worth
living
in
i
can
understand
why
people
commit
suicide
he
spoke
softly
gazing
into
the
fire
hugh
had
given
him
rapt
attention
suddenly
he
spoke
up
forgetting
his
resolve
not
to
say
anything
more
after
ferguson
had
called
him
innocent
i
think
you
wrong
mel
he
said
positively
i
was
reading
a
book
the
other
day
called
it
all
about
gipsies
well
this
fellow
lavengro
was
all
busted
up
and
depressed
he
just
about
made
up
his
mind
to
commit
suicide
when
he
meets
a
friend
of
his
a
gipsy
he
tells
the
gipsy
that
he
going
to
bump
himself
off
that
he
does
see
anything
in
life
to
live
for
then
the
gipsy
answers
him
gee
it
hit
me
square
in
the
eye
and
i
memorized
it
on
the
spot
i
think
i
can
say
it
he
says
night
and
day
brother
both
sweet
things
sun
moon
and
stars
brother
all
sweet
things
likewise
a
wind
on
the
heath
life
is
very
sweet
brother
who
would
wish
to
die
i
think
that
beautiful
he
added
simply
and
i
think
it
true
too
good
for
you
hugh
ross
said
quietly
hugh
blushed
with
pleasure
but
he
was
taken
back
by
nutter
vigorous
rejoinder
bunk
he
exclaimed
hooey
the
sun
moon
and
stars
and
all
that
stuff
sounds
pretty
but
it
is
life
life
earning
a
living
and
working
like
hell
and
women
and
pleasure
the
the
only
poem
if
you
going
to
quote
poetry
that
the
only
poem
i
ever
saw
that
had
any
sense
to
it
come
beloved
fill
the
cup
that
clears
of
past
regrets
and
future
fears
why
i
may
be
myself
with
yesterday
seven
thousand
years
you
bet
you
never
can
tell
when
you
going
to
be
bumped
off
and
so
you
might
just
as
well
have
a
good
time
while
you
can
you
damn
well
do
know
what
coming
after
you
kick
the
bucket
good
stuff
the
said
ferguson
lazily
he
was
lying
on
his
back
staring
at
the
ceiling
i
bet
i
read
it
a
hundred
times
when
they
turn
down
an
empty
glass
for
me
it
going
to
be
i
know
what
i
here
for
or
where
i
going
or
why
this
world
and
why
not
knowing
and
so
on
my
folks
sent
me
to
and
brought
me
up
to
be
a
good
little
boy
i
believed
just
about
everything
they
told
me
until
i
came
to
college
now
i
know
they
told
me
a
lot
of
damned
lies
and
i
talked
with
a
lot
of
fellows
who
had
the
same
experience
anybody
got
a
butt
burbank
who
was
nearest
to
him
passed
him
a
package
of
cigarettes
ferguson
extracted
one
lighted
it
blew
smoke
at
the
ceiling
and
then
quietly
continued
drawling
lazily
most
fellows
do
tell
their
folks
anything
and
there
no
reason
why
they
should
either
our
folks
lie
to
us
from
the
time
we
are
babies
they
lie
to
us
about
birth
and
god
and
life
my
folks
never
told
me
the
truth
about
anything
when
i
came
to
college
i
was
very
innocent
about
women
but
i
was
about
everything
else
i
believed
that
god
made
the
world
in
six
days
the
way
the
bible
says
and
that
some
day
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
and
that
we
all
be
pulled
up
to
heaven
where
christ
would
give
us
the
then
he
ship
some
of
us
to
hell
and
give
the
good
ones
harps
well
since
i
found
out
that
all
that
hooey
i
do
believe
in
much
of
anything
i
suppose
you
are
talking
about
evolution
said
ross
well
prof
humbert
says
that
evolutions
has
anything
to
do
with
the
bible
he
says
that
science
is
science
and
that
religion
is
religion
and
that
the
two
do
mix
he
says
that
he
holds
by
evolution
but
that
that
make
christ
philosophy
bad
no
burbank
agreed
it
does
make
it
bad
but
that
is
the
point
i
read
the
bible
which
i
bet
is
more
than
the
rest
of
you
can
say
and
i
read
the
sermon
on
the
mount
a
dozen
times
it
darn
good
sense
but
what
good
does
it
do
the
world
will
never
practice
philosophy
the
bible
says
is
born
to
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
and
believe
me
that
damn
true
if
people
would
be
pure
and
good
then
christ
philosophy
would
work
but
they
are
pure
and
good
they
are
made
pure
and
good
they
made
selfish
and
bad
they
made
mind
you
made
full
of
evil
and
lust
i
tell
you
it
all
wrong
i
been
reading
and
reading
and
the
more
i
read
the
more
convinced
that
we
all
rotten
and
that
if
there
is
a
god
he
made
us
rotten
you
wrong
they
all
turned
toward
winsor
who
was
still
standing
by
the
fireplace
even
ferguson
rolled
over
and
looked
at
the
excited
boy
you
wrong
he
repeated
all
wrong
i
admit
all
that
been
said
about
parents
they
do
cheat
us
just
as
don
said
i
never
tell
my
folks
anything
that
really
matters
and
i
do
know
any
other
fellows
that
do
either
i
suppose
there
are
some
but
i
do
know
them
and
i
admit
that
there
is
sin
and
vice
but
i
do
admit
that
christ
philosophy
is
useless
i
read
the
sermon
on
the
mount
too
that
about
all
of
the
bible
that
i
have
read
but
i
read
that
and
i
tell
you
all
wrong
there
is
enough
good
in
man
to
make
that
philosophy
practical
why
there
is
more
kindness
and
goodness
around
than
we
know
about
we
see
the
evil
and
we
know
we
have
lusts
and
and
things
but
we
do
good
too
and
hugh
was
right
when
he
talked
a
while
ago
about
the
beauty
in
the
world
there
lots
of
it
lots
and
lots
of
it
beautiful
poetry
and
beautiful
music
and
beautiful
scenery
and
there
are
people
who
appreciate
all
of
it
i
tell
you
that
in
spite
of
everything
life
is
worth
living
and
i
believe
in
christ
philosophy
too
i
do
know
whether
he
is
the
son
of
god
or
not
i
think
that
he
must
be
but
that
does
make
any
difference
look
at
the
wonderful
influence
he
has
had
rot
said
burbank
calmly
absolute
rot
there
has
never
been
a
good
deed
done
in
his
name
just
the
inquisition
and
the
in
russia
oh
yes
pogroms
and
wars
and
robbing
people
christianity
is
just
a
name
there
is
any
such
thing
and
most
of
the
professional
christians
that
i
seen
are
damn
fools
i
tell
you
george
it
all
wrong
we
all
in
the
dark
and
i
do
believe
the
profs
know
any
more
about
it
than
we
do
oh
yes
they
do
hugh
exclaimed
they
must
think
of
all
the
studying
they
done
bah
burbank
was
contemptuous
they
read
a
lot
of
books
all
most
of
them
never
had
an
idea
in
their
lives
oh
i
know
that
some
of
them
think
if
they
did
i
leave
college
men
like
davis
and
maxwell
and
henley
and
jimpson
who
keep
me
here
but
most
of
the
profs
ca
do
anything
more
than
spout
a
few
facts
that
they
got
out
of
books
no
they
do
know
any
more
about
it
than
we
do
we
do
know
why
we
here
or
where
we
going
or
what
we
ought
to
do
while
we
are
here
and
we
get
into
groups
and
tell
smutty
stories
and
talk
about
women
and
religion
and
we
do
know
any
more
than
when
we
started
think
of
all
the
talk
that
goes
on
around
this
college
about
sex
there
no
end
to
it
some
of
the
fellows
say
positively
there
no
sense
in
staying
straight
and
a
few
damn
few
admit
that
they
think
a
fellow
ought
to
leave
women
alone
but
most
of
them
are
in
a
muddle
he
rose
and
stretched
i
got
to
be
going
philosophy
quiz
he
smiled
i
do
agree
with
nutter
and
i
do
agree
with
george
and
i
do
agree
with
you
don
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
do
agree
with
myself
you
fellows
can
bull
about
this
some
more
if
you
want
to
i
got
to
study
no
they
ca
said
ross
not
here
anyway
i
got
to
study
too
the
whole
of
you
have
to
get
out
the
boys
rose
and
stretched
ferguson
rolled
lazily
off
the
couch
well
he
said
with
a
yawn
this
has
been
very
edifying
i
heard
it
all
before
in
a
hundred
bull
sessions
and
i
suppose
i
hear
it
all
again
i
do
know
why
i
hung
around
there
a
little
dame
that
i
got
to
write
a
letter
to
and
believe
me
she
a
damn
sight
more
interesting
than
all
your
bull
he
strolled
out
of
the
door
drawling
a
slow
good
night
over
his
shoulder
hugh
went
to
his
room
and
thought
over
the
talk
he
was
miserably
confused
like
ferguson
he
had
believed
everything
that
his
father
and
mother
and
the
minister
had
told
him
and
he
found
himself
beginning
to
discard
their
ideas
there
did
seem
to
be
any
ideas
to
put
in
the
place
of
those
he
discarded
until
carl
recent
confidence
he
had
believed
firmly
in
chastity
but
he
discovered
once
the
first
shock
had
worn
off
that
he
liked
carl
the
unchaste
just
as
much
as
he
had
carl
the
chaste
carl
seemed
neither
better
nor
worse
for
his
experience
he
was
lashed
by
desire
he
was
burning
with
curiosity
and
yet
and
yet
something
held
him
back
something
he
hardly
knew
what
it
was
made
him
avoid
any
woman
who
had
a
reputation
for
moral
laxity
he
shrank
from
such
a
woman
and
desired
her
so
intensely
that
he
was
ashamed
life
was
suddenly
becoming
very
complicated
more
complicated
it
seemed
every
day
with
other
undergraduates
he
discussed
women
and
religion
endlessly
but
he
never
reached
any
satisfactory
conclusions
he
wished
that
he
knew
some
professor
that
he
could
talk
to
surely
some
of
them
must
know
the
answers
to
his
riddles
chapter
xvi
hugh
was
troubled
only
by
religion
and
sex
the
whole
college
was
disturbing
his
peace
of
mind
all
of
his
illusions
were
being
ruthlessly
shattered
he
had
supposed
that
all
professors
were
wise
men
that
their
knowledge
was
almost
limitless
and
he
was
finding
that
many
of
the
undergraduates
were
frankly
contemptuous
of
the
majority
of
their
teachers
and
that
he
himself
was
finding
inspiration
from
only
a
few
of
them
he
went
to
his
classes
because
he
felt
that
he
had
to
but
in
most
of
them
he
was
confused
or
bored
he
learned
more
in
the
bull
sessions
than
he
did
in
the
and
men
like
ross
and
burbank
were
teaching
him
more
than
his
instructors
further
nu
delta
was
proving
a
keen
disappointment
more
and
more
he
found
himself
thinking
of
malcolm
graham
talk
to
him
during
the
rushing
season
of
his
freshman
year
he
often
wished
that
graham
were
still
in
college
so
that
he
could
go
to
him
for
advice
the
fraternity
was
not
the
brotherhood
that
he
had
dreamed
about
it
was
composed
of
several
cliques
warring
with
each
other
never
coalescing
into
a
single
group
except
to
contest
the
control
of
a
student
activity
with
some
other
fraternity
there
were
a
few
brothers
that
hugh
liked
but
most
of
them
were
not
his
kind
at
all
many
of
them
were
athletes
taken
into
the
fraternity
because
they
were
athletes
and
for
no
other
reason
and
although
hugh
liked
two
of
the
athletes
they
were
really
splendid
fellows
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
three
of
them
were
hardly
better
than
thugs
cheap
muckers
with
fine
bodies
then
there
were
the
snobs
usually
prep
school
men
with
more
money
than
they
could
handle
wisely
utterly
contemptuous
of
any
man
not
belonging
to
a
fraternity
or
of
one
belonging
to
any
of
the
lesser
fraternities
these
were
the
smooth
boys
interested
primarily
in
clothes
and
parties
passing
their
courses
by
the
aid
of
tutors
or
fraternity
brothers
who
happened
to
study
hugh
felt
that
he
ought
to
like
all
of
his
fraternity
brothers
but
try
as
he
would
he
disliked
the
majority
of
them
early
in
his
sophomore
year
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
have
gone
delta
sigma
delta
that
that
fraternity
contained
a
group
of
men
whom
he
liked
and
respected
most
of
them
at
least
they
were
prominent
in
student
activities
but
they
were
earnest
lads
as
a
whole
trying
hard
to
get
something
out
of
college
the
nu
delta
meetings
every
monday
night
were
a
revelation
to
him
the
brothers
were
openly
bored
they
paid
little
or
no
attention
to
the
business
before
them
the
president
was
constantly
calling
for
order
and
not
getting
it
during
the
rushing
season
in
the
second
term
interest
picked
up
freshmen
were
being
discussed
four
questions
were
inevitably
asked
did
the
freshman
have
money
was
he
an
athlete
had
he
gone
to
a
prep
school
what
was
his
family
like
hugh
had
been
very
much
attracted
by
a
lad
named
parker
he
was
a
charming
youngster
with
a
good
mind
and
beautiful
manners
in
general
only
bad
manners
were
at
sanford
so
parker
was
naturally
conspicuous
hugh
proposed
his
name
for
membership
to
nu
delta
he
a
harp
said
a
brother
scornfully
at
any
rate
he
a
catholic
that
settled
that
only
protestants
were
eligible
to
nu
delta
at
sanford
although
the
fraternity
had
no
national
rule
prohibiting
members
of
other
religions
the
snobbery
of
the
fraternity
cut
hugh
deeply
he
was
a
friendly
lad
who
had
never
been
taught
prejudice
he
even
made
friends
with
a
jewish
youth
and
was
severely
censured
by
three
fraternity
brothers
for
that
friendship
he
was
especially
taken
to
task
by
bob
tucker
the
president
look
here
hugh
tucker
said
sternly
you
got
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
i
suppose
einstein
is
a
good
fellow
and
all
that
but
been
running
around
with
him
a
lot
you
even
brought
him
here
several
times
of
course
you
can
have
anybody
in
your
room
you
want
but
we
do
want
any
jews
around
the
house
i
do
see
why
you
had
to
pick
him
up
anyway
there
plenty
of
christians
in
college
he
a
fellow
hugh
replied
stubbornly
and
i
like
him
i
do
see
why
we
have
to
be
so
about
jews
and
catholics
most
of
the
fraternities
take
in
catholics
and
the
phi
thetas
take
in
jews
at
least
they
got
two
they
bid
einstein
but
he
turned
them
down
his
folks
do
want
him
to
join
a
fraternity
and
chubby
elson
told
me
that
the
theta
kappas
wanted
him
awfully
but
they
have
a
local
rule
against
jews
that
does
make
any
difference
tucker
said
sharply
we
do
want
him
around
here
because
some
of
the
fraternities
are
so
damn
is
any
reason
that
we
ought
to
be
i
do
see
that
their
is
getting
them
anything
we
rate
about
ten
times
as
much
as
the
phi
thetas
or
the
theta
kappas
and
the
reason
we
do
is
that
we
are
so
much
more
exclusive
hugh
wanted
to
mention
the
three
nu
delta
thugs
but
he
wisely
restrained
himself
all
right
he
said
stubbornly
i
wo
bring
einstein
around
here
again
and
i
wo
bring
parker
either
but
see
just
as
much
of
them
as
i
want
to
my
friends
are
my
friends
and
if
the
fraternity
does
like
them
it
can
leave
them
alone
i
pledged
loyalty
to
the
fraternity
but
i
be
damned
if
i
pledged
my
life
to
it
he
got
up
and
started
for
the
door
his
blue
eyes
dark
with
anger
i
hate
snobs
he
said
viciously
and
departed
after
rushing
season
was
over
he
rarely
entered
that
fraternity
house
chumming
mostly
with
carl
but
finding
friends
in
other
fraternities
or
among
men
he
was
depressed
and
gloomy
although
his
grades
for
the
first
term
had
been
respectable
nothing
seemed
very
much
worth
while
not
even
making
his
letter
on
the
track
he
was
gradually
taking
to
cigarettes
and
he
had
even
had
a
nip
or
two
out
of
a
flask
that
carl
had
brought
to
the
room
he
had
read
the
rubaiyat
and
it
made
a
great
impression
on
him
he
and
carl
often
discussed
the
poem
and
more
and
more
hugh
was
beginning
to
believe
in
omar
philosophy
at
least
he
could
answer
the
arguments
presented
in
beautiful
quatrains
the
poem
both
depressed
and
thrilled
him
after
reading
it
he
felt
desperate
and
ready
for
anything
convinced
that
the
only
wise
course
was
to
take
the
cash
and
let
the
credit
go
he
was
much
too
young
to
hear
the
rumble
of
the
distant
drum
sometimes
he
was
sure
that
there
was
a
drum
anyway
he
was
particularly
blue
one
afternoon
when
carl
rushed
into
the
room
and
urged
him
to
go
to
hastings
a
town
five
miles
from
haydensville
jim
pearson
outside
with
his
car
carl
said
excitedly
and
take
us
down
he
got
to
come
right
back
he
only
going
for
some
booze
but
we
need
come
back
if
we
do
want
to
we
have
a
drink
and
give
hastings
the
how
to
come
along
all
right
hugh
agreed
indifferently
and
began
to
pull
on
his
coat
i
with
you
a
shot
of
gin
might
jazz
me
up
a
little
once
in
hastings
pearson
drove
to
a
private
residence
at
the
edge
of
the
town
the
boys
got
out
of
the
car
and
filed
around
to
the
back
door
which
was
opened
to
their
knock
by
a
young
man
with
a
hatchet
face
and
hard
blue
eyes
hello
pearson
he
said
with
an
effort
to
be
pleasant
want
some
gin
yes
and
some
scotch
too
pete
if
you
have
it
i
take
two
quarts
of
scotch
and
one
of
gin
all
right
pete
led
the
way
down
into
the
cellar
switching
on
an
electric
light
when
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
was
a
small
bar
in
the
rear
of
the
dingy
underground
room
a
table
or
two
and
dozens
of
small
boxes
stacked
against
the
wall
it
was
hugh
first
visit
to
a
bootlegger
den
and
he
was
keenly
interested
he
had
a
along
with
carl
and
pearson
then
took
another
when
carl
offered
to
stand
treat
pearson
bought
his
three
quarts
of
liquor
paid
pete
and
departed
alone
carl
and
hugh
having
decided
to
have
another
drink
or
two
before
they
returned
to
haydensville
after
a
second
hugh
did
not
care
how
many
he
drank
and
was
rather
peevish
when
carl
insisted
that
he
stop
with
a
third
pete
charged
them
eight
dollars
for
their
drinks
which
they
cheerfully
paid
and
then
warily
climbed
the
stairs
and
stumbled
out
into
the
cold
winter
air
brr
said
carl
buttoning
his
coat
up
to
his
chin
it
cold
as
hell
so
is
hugh
agreed
so
is
so
is
that
pretty
so
is
so
so
is
is
that
pretty
carl
awful
pretty
say
it
again
so
is
so
so
so
so
what
wush
it
carl
so
is
oh
yes
so
they
walked
slowly
arm
in
arm
toward
the
business
section
of
hastings
pausing
now
and
then
to
laugh
joyously
over
something
that
appealed
to
them
as
inordinately
funny
once
it
was
a
tree
another
time
a
farmer
in
a
sleigh
and
a
third
time
a
ford
hugh
insisted
after
laughing
until
he
wept
that
the
ford
was
the
funniest
goddamned
thing
he
ever
seen
carl
agreed
with
him
they
were
both
pretty
thoroughly
drunk
by
the
time
they
reached
the
center
of
the
town
where
they
intended
getting
the
bus
back
to
haydensville
two
girls
passed
them
and
smiled
invitingly
oh
what
peaches
carl
exclaimed
jush
jush
jush
swell
hugh
said
with
great
positiveness
hanging
on
to
carl
arm
they
the
shwellest
janes
i
ever
sheen
the
girls
who
were
a
few
feet
ahead
turned
and
smiled
again
let
pick
them
up
carl
whispered
loudly
shure
and
hugh
started
unsteadily
to
increase
his
pace
the
girls
were
professional
prostitutes
who
visited
hastings
twice
a
year
to
get
the
sanford
trade
they
were
crude
specimens
revealing
their
profession
to
the
most
casual
observer
if
hugh
had
been
sober
they
would
have
sickened
him
but
he
was
sober
he
was
joyously
drunk
and
the
girls
looked
very
desirable
hello
girls
carl
said
expansively
taking
hold
of
one
girl
arm
busy
hugh
repeated
valiantly
the
older
girl
smiled
revealing
five
gold
teeth
of
course
not
she
replied
in
a
hard
flat
voice
not
too
busy
for
you
boys
anyway
come
along
with
us
and
we
make
this
a
big
afternoon
sure
carl
agreed
hugh
stuttered
he
reached
forward
to
take
the
arm
of
the
girl
who
had
spoken
but
at
the
same
instant
some
one
caught
him
by
the
wrist
and
held
him
still
harry
slade
the
star
football
player
and
this
year
captain
happened
to
be
in
hastings
he
was
in
fact
seeking
these
very
girls
he
had
intended
to
pass
on
when
he
saw
two
men
with
them
but
as
soon
as
he
recognized
hugh
he
paused
and
then
impulsively
strode
forward
here
carver
he
said
sharply
what
are
you
doing
none
none
of
you
business
hugh
replied
angrily
trying
to
shake
his
wrist
free
leggo
of
me
or
or
i
i
you
wo
do
anything
interrupted
you
going
home
with
me
who
in
hell
are
you
one
of
the
girls
asked
viciously
mind
your
own
damn
business
you
mind
yours
sister
or
you
get
into
a
peck
of
trouble
this
kid
going
with
me
and
do
forget
that
come
on
carver
hugh
was
still
vainly
trying
to
twist
his
wrist
free
and
was
muttering
leggo
leggo
o
me
slade
jerked
him
across
the
sidewalk
carl
followed
expostulating
get
the
hell
out
of
here
peters
slade
said
angrily
or
i
knock
your
fool
block
off
you
chase
off
with
those
rats
if
you
want
to
but
you
leave
carver
with
me
if
you
know
what
good
for
you
he
shoved
carl
away
and
carl
was
sober
enough
to
know
that
slade
meant
what
he
said
each
girl
took
him
by
an
arm
and
he
walked
off
down
the
street
between
them
almost
instantly
forgetting
hugh
fortunately
the
street
was
nearly
deserted
and
no
one
had
witnessed
the
little
drama
hugh
began
to
sob
drunkenly
slade
grasped
his
shoulders
and
shook
him
until
his
head
waggled
now
shut
up
slade
commanded
sharply
he
took
hugh
by
the
arm
and
started
down
the
street
with
him
hugh
still
muttering
leggo
leggo
o
me
slade
walked
him
the
whole
five
miles
back
to
haydensville
and
before
they
were
half
way
home
hugh
head
began
to
clear
for
a
time
he
felt
a
little
sick
but
the
nausea
passed
and
when
they
reached
the
campus
he
was
quite
sober
not
a
word
was
spoken
until
hugh
unlocked
the
door
of
surrey
then
slade
said
go
wash
your
face
and
head
in
cold
water
souse
yourself
good
and
then
come
back
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
hugh
obeyed
orders
but
with
poor
grace
he
was
angry
and
confused
angry
because
his
liberty
had
been
interfered
with
and
confused
because
slade
had
never
paid
more
than
passing
attention
to
him
and
for
a
year
and
a
half
slade
had
been
his
god
slade
was
one
of
those
superb
natural
athletes
who
make
history
for
many
colleges
he
was
big
powerfully
built
and
moved
as
easily
as
a
dancer
his
features
were
good
enough
but
his
brown
eyes
were
dull
and
his
jaw
heavy
rather
than
strong
hugh
had
often
heard
that
slade
dissipated
violently
but
he
did
not
believe
the
rumors
he
was
positive
that
slade
could
not
be
the
athlete
he
was
if
he
dissipated
he
had
been
thrilled
every
time
slade
had
spoken
to
him
the
big
man
of
the
college
the
one
sanford
man
who
had
ever
made
all
american
as
slade
had
this
year
when
he
returned
to
his
room
from
the
slade
was
sitting
in
a
big
chair
smoking
a
cigarette
hugh
walked
into
his
bedroom
combed
his
dripping
hair
and
then
came
into
the
study
still
angry
but
feeling
a
little
sheepish
and
very
curious
well
what
is
it
he
demanded
sitting
down
do
you
know
who
those
women
were
no
who
are
they
they
bessie
haines
and
emma
gleeson
at
least
that
what
they
call
themselves
and
they
rotten
bags
hugh
had
a
little
quiver
of
fright
but
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
defend
himself
well
what
of
it
he
asked
sullenly
i
do
see
as
you
had
any
right
to
pull
me
away
you
never
paid
any
attention
before
to
me
why
this
sudden
interest
how
come
you
so
anxious
to
guard
my
purity
slade
was
embarrassed
he
threw
his
cigarette
into
the
fireplace
and
immediately
lighted
another
one
then
he
looked
at
his
shoes
and
muttered
i
a
pretty
bad
egg
myself
so
i
heard
hugh
was
frankly
sarcastic
well
i
am
slade
looked
up
defiantly
i
guess
it
up
to
me
to
explain
and
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
i
a
dumbbell
i
ca
talk
decently
i
flunked
english
one
three
times
you
know
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
blurted
out
i
was
looking
for
those
bags
myself
what
hugh
leaned
forward
and
stared
at
him
bewildered
and
dumfounded
were
looking
for
them
yeah
you
see
i
a
bad
egg
always
been
a
bad
one
with
women
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
got
ta
have
one
about
every
so
often
i
i
not
much
but
what
made
you
stop
me
hugh
pressed
his
hand
to
his
temple
his
head
was
aching
and
he
could
make
nothing
out
of
slade
talk
because
because
oh
hell
carver
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
i
and
you
about
nineteen
and
i
know
a
lot
that
you
do
i
was
brought
up
in
south
boston
and
i
ran
with
a
gang
there
was
anything
rotten
that
we
did
do
i
been
watching
you
you
different
how
different
hugh
demanded
i
want
women
just
as
much
as
you
do
that
is
it
slade
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thick
black
hair
and
scowled
fiercely
at
the
fireplace
that
is
it
at
all
you
awfully
clean
and
decent
i
been
watching
you
lots
oh
for
a
year
you
you
different
he
finished
lamely
hugh
was
beginning
to
understand
do
you
mean
he
asked
slowly
that
you
want
me
to
keep
straight
that
that
well
that
you
like
me
that
way
better
he
was
really
asking
slade
if
he
admired
him
and
slade
got
his
meaning
perfectly
to
hugh
the
idea
was
preposterous
why
slade
had
made
every
society
on
the
campus
he
had
been
given
every
honor
that
the
students
could
heap
on
him
and
he
envied
hugh
an
almost
unknown
sophomore
why
it
was
ridiculous
yes
that
what
i
mean
that
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
for
a
minute
slade
hesitated
he
was
used
to
giving
expression
to
his
confused
emotions
and
he
did
know
how
to
go
about
it
i
i
like
to
be
like
you
that
it
i
i
did
want
you
to
be
like
me
those
women
are
awful
bags
anything
might
happen
why
did
you
stop
carl
peters
too
then
peters
knows
his
way
about
he
can
take
care
of
himself
different
though
you
never
been
drunk
before
have
you
no
no
i
never
have
hugh
irritation
was
all
gone
he
was
touched
deeply
touched
by
slade
clumsy
admiration
and
he
felt
weak
emotionally
exhausted
after
his
little
spree
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
to
think
of
me
that
way
i
i
glad
you
stopped
me
slade
stood
up
he
felt
that
he
had
better
be
going
he
could
tell
hugh
how
much
he
liked
and
admired
him
how
much
he
envied
him
he
was
altogether
sentimental
about
the
boy
entirely
devoted
to
him
he
had
wanted
to
talk
to
hugh
more
than
hugh
had
wanted
to
talk
to
him
but
he
had
never
felt
that
he
had
anything
to
offer
that
could
possibly
interest
hugh
it
was
a
strange
situation
the
hero
had
put
the
hero
worshiper
on
a
high
white
marble
pedestal
he
moved
toward
the
door
so
long
he
said
as
casually
as
he
could
hugh
jumped
up
and
rushed
to
him
i
awfully
grateful
to
you
harry
he
said
impulsively
it
was
damn
white
of
you
i
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
he
held
out
his
hand
slade
gripped
it
for
a
moment
and
then
muttering
another
so
long
passed
out
of
the
door
hugh
was
more
confused
than
ever
and
grew
steadily
more
confused
as
the
days
passed
he
could
understand
why
slade
frankly
unchaste
himself
should
consider
his
chastity
so
important
he
was
genuinely
glad
that
slade
had
rescued
him
genuinely
grateful
but
his
confusion
about
all
things
sexual
was
more
confounded
the
strangest
thing
was
that
when
he
told
carl
about
slade
talk
carl
seemed
to
understand
perfectly
though
he
never
offered
a
satisfactory
explanation
i
know
how
he
feels
carl
said
and
i
awfully
glad
he
butted
in
and
pulled
you
away
i
hate
to
see
you
messing
around
with
bags
like
that
myself
and
if
i
had
been
drunk
i
would
have
let
you
i
more
grateful
to
him
than
you
are
gee
i
never
have
forgiven
myself
he
concluded
fervently
just
when
the
incident
was
beginning
to
occupy
less
of
hugh
thoughts
it
was
suddenly
brought
back
with
a
crash
he
came
home
from
the
gymnasium
one
afternoon
to
find
carl
seated
at
his
desk
writing
he
looked
up
when
hugh
came
in
tore
the
paper
into
fragments
and
tossed
them
info
the
guess
i
better
tell
you
he
said
briefly
i
was
just
writing
a
note
to
you
to
me
why
carl
pointed
to
his
standing
by
the
that
why
going
away
on
a
party
my
trunk
left
an
hour
ago
i
going
away
for
good
carl
voice
was
husky
and
he
spoke
with
an
obvious
effort
hugh
walked
quickly
to
the
desk
why
old
man
what
the
matter
anything
wrong
with
your
mother
you
not
sick
are
you
carl
laughed
briefly
bitterly
yes
i
sick
all
right
i
sick
hugh
worried
looked
at
him
seriously
why
what
the
matter
i
did
know
that
you
were
feeling
well
carl
looked
at
the
rug
and
muttered
you
remember
those
rats
we
picked
up
in
hastings
yes
well
i
know
of
seven
fellows
they
sent
home
what
hugh
cried
his
eyes
wide
with
horror
you
do
mean
that
you
that
you
i
mean
exactly
that
carl
replied
in
a
low
flat
voice
he
rose
and
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
i
mean
exactly
that
and
doc
conners
agrees
with
me
he
added
sarcastically
then
more
softly
got
to
tell
the
dean
that
why
i
going
home
hugh
was
swept
simultaneously
by
revulsion
and
sympathy
god
sorry
he
exclaimed
oh
carl
i
so
damn
sorry
carl
was
standing
by
hugh
desk
his
hands
clenched
his
lips
compressed
keep
my
junk
he
said
unevenly
and
sell
anything
you
want
to
if
you
live
in
the
house
next
year
but
you
be
back
no
i
wo
come
back
i
wo
come
back
he
was
having
a
hard
time
to
keep
back
the
tears
and
bit
his
trembling
lip
mercilessly
oh
hugh
he
suddenly
cried
what
will
my
mother
say
hugh
was
deeply
distressed
but
he
was
startled
by
that
my
mother
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
heard
carl
speak
of
his
mother
except
as
the
old
lady
she
will
understand
he
said
soothingly
how
can
she
how
can
she
god
hugh
god
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
hugh
put
his
arm
around
his
shoulder
and
tried
to
comfort
him
and
in
a
few
minutes
carl
was
in
control
of
himself
again
he
dried
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
what
a
fish
i
am
he
said
trying
to
grin
a
goddamn
fish
he
looked
at
his
watch
hell
i
got
to
be
going
if
i
going
to
make
the
five
fifteen
he
picked
up
his
and
held
out
his
free
hand
there
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
hugh
but
i
guess
i
write
it
please
do
come
to
the
train
with
me
he
gripped
hugh
hand
hard
for
an
instant
and
then
was
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
hall
before
hugh
had
time
to
say
anything
two
days
afterward
the
letter
came
the
customary
dear
brother
and
fraternally
yours
were
omitted
dear
hugh
i
thought
of
letters
yards
long
but
i
not
going
to
write
them
i
just
want
to
say
that
you
are
the
finest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
outside
of
my
mother
and
i
respect
you
more
than
any
fellow
i
ever
known
ashamed
because
i
started
you
drinking
and
i
hope
stop
it
i
feel
toward
you
the
way
harry
slade
does
only
more
i
guess
you
done
an
awful
lot
for
me
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
please
leave
women
alone
keep
straight
please
you
do
know
how
much
i
want
you
to
do
that
thanks
for
all
you
done
for
me
carl
hugh
eyes
filled
with
tears
when
he
read
that
letter
carl
seemed
a
tragic
figure
to
him
and
he
missed
him
dreadfully
poor
old
carl
what
hell
it
must
have
been
to
tell
his
mother
and
he
wants
me
to
keep
straight
by
god
i
will
i
try
to
anyhow
chapter
xvii
hugh
depression
was
not
continuous
by
any
means
he
was
much
too
young
and
too
healthy
not
to
find
life
an
enjoyable
experience
most
of
the
time
disillusionment
followed
disillusionment
each
one
painful
and
dispiriting
in
itself
but
they
came
at
long
enough
intervals
for
him
to
find
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
between
also
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
transferred
from
section
in
latin
he
was
taking
genuine
interest
in
a
course
having
decided
to
major
in
english
he
found
that
he
was
required
to
take
a
composition
course
the
second
half
of
his
sophomore
year
his
instructor
was
professor
henley
known
as
jimmie
henley
among
the
students
a
man
in
his
middle
thirties
spare
neat
in
his
dress
sharp
with
his
tongue
apt
to
say
what
he
thought
in
terms
so
plain
that
not
even
the
stupidest
undergraduate
could
fail
to
understand
him
his
eyes
were
capable
of
a
friendly
twinkle
but
they
had
a
way
of
darkening
suddenly
and
snapping
that
kept
his
students
constantly
on
the
alert
there
was
little
of
the
professor
about
him
but
a
great
deal
of
the
teacher
hugh
went
to
his
first
conference
with
him
not
entirely
easy
in
his
mind
henley
had
a
reputation
for
tearing
themes
to
pieces
and
making
a
fellow
feel
like
a
poor
fish
hugh
had
written
his
themes
hastily
as
he
had
during
his
freshman
year
and
he
was
afraid
that
henley
might
discover
evidences
of
that
haste
henley
was
leaning
back
in
his
swivel
chair
his
feet
on
the
desk
a
brier
pipe
in
his
mouth
as
hugh
entered
the
cubbyhole
of
an
office
down
came
the
feet
with
a
bang
hello
carver
henley
said
cheerfully
come
in
and
sit
down
while
i
go
through
your
themes
he
motioned
to
a
chair
by
the
desk
hugh
muttered
a
shy
hello
and
sat
down
watching
henley
expectantly
and
rather
uncomfortably
henley
picked
up
three
themes
then
he
turned
his
keen
eyes
on
hugh
i
already
read
these
lazy
cuss
are
you
he
asked
amiably
hugh
flushed
i
i
suppose
so
you
know
that
you
are
no
supposing
to
it
he
slapped
the
desk
lightly
with
the
themes
first
drafts
are
they
yes
sir
hugh
felt
his
cheeks
getting
warmer
henley
smiled
thanks
for
not
lying
if
you
had
lied
this
conference
would
have
ended
right
now
oh
i
would
have
told
you
that
i
thought
you
were
lying
i
would
simply
have
made
a
few
polite
but
entirely
insincere
comments
about
your
work
and
let
you
go
now
i
am
going
to
talk
to
you
frankly
and
honestly
i
wish
you
would
hugh
murmured
but
he
was
at
all
sure
that
he
wished
anything
of
the
sort
henley
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
into
a
metal
tray
refilled
it
lighted
it
and
then
puffed
meditatively
gazing
at
hugh
with
kind
but
speculative
eyes
i
think
you
have
ability
he
began
slowly
you
evidently
write
with
great
fluency
and
considerable
accuracy
and
i
can
find
poetic
touches
here
and
there
that
please
me
but
you
are
careless
abominably
careless
lazy
whatever
virtues
there
are
in
your
themes
come
from
a
natural
gift
not
from
any
effort
you
made
to
say
the
thing
in
the
best
way
now
i
not
going
to
spend
anytime
discussing
these
themes
in
detail
they
are
worth
it
he
pointed
his
pipe
at
hugh
the
point
is
exactly
this
he
said
sternly
i
never
spend
any
time
discussing
your
themes
so
long
as
you
turn
in
hasty
shoddy
work
i
can
see
right
now
that
you
can
get
a
c
in
this
course
without
trying
if
that
all
you
want
all
right
give
it
to
you
and
let
it
go
at
that
the
lord
knows
that
i
have
enough
to
do
without
wasting
time
on
lazy
youngsters
who
have
sense
enough
to
develop
their
gifts
if
you
continue
to
turn
in
themes
like
these
i
give
you
c
or
d
on
them
and
let
you
dig
your
own
shallow
grave
by
yourself
but
if
you
want
to
try
to
write
as
well
as
you
can
give
you
all
the
help
in
my
power
not
one
minute
can
you
have
so
long
as
you
do
try
but
you
can
have
hours
if
you
do
try
furthermore
you
will
find
writing
a
pleasure
if
you
write
as
well
as
you
can
but
you
wo
get
any
sport
just
scribbling
off
themes
because
you
have
to
he
paused
to
toss
the
three
themes
across
the
desk
to
hugh
who
was
watching
him
with
astonishment
no
instructor
had
ever
talked
to
him
that
way
before
you
can
rewrite
these
themes
if
you
want
to
henley
went
on
i
have
graded
them
and
i
reserve
the
grades
for
the
rewritten
themes
and
if
i
find
that
you
have
made
a
real
effort
i
discuss
them
in
detail
with
you
what
do
you
say
i
like
to
rewrite
them
hugh
said
softly
i
know
they
are
rotten
no
they
are
rotten
i
got
dozens
that
are
worse
that
is
the
point
they
are
nearly
so
good
as
you
can
make
them
and
only
your
best
work
is
acceptable
to
me
now
show
me
what
you
can
do
with
them
and
then
we
tear
them
to
shreds
in
regular
fashion
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
smiled
at
hugh
who
understanding
that
the
conference
was
over
stood
up
and
reached
for
the
themes
i
be
interested
in
seeing
what
you
can
do
with
those
henley
concluded
every
one
of
them
has
a
good
idea
go
to
it
and
get
them
back
in
a
week
yes
sir
thanks
very
much
sir
and
hugh
left
the
office
determined
to
rewrite
those
themes
so
that
they
knock
jimmie
henley
eye
out
they
did
do
exactly
that
but
they
did
interest
him
and
he
spent
an
hour
and
a
half
discussing
them
with
hugh
that
was
merely
the
first
of
a
series
of
long
conferences
sometimes
henley
and
hugh
discussed
writing
but
often
they
talked
about
other
subjects
not
as
instructor
and
student
but
as
two
men
who
respected
each
other
mind
before
the
term
was
out
henley
had
invited
hugh
to
his
home
for
dinner
and
to
meet
henley
hugh
was
enormously
flattered
and
for
some
reason
stimulated
to
do
better
work
he
found
his
talks
with
henley
really
exciting
and
he
expressed
his
opinions
to
him
as
freely
and
almost
as
positively
as
he
did
to
his
classmates
he
told
his
friends
that
jimmie
henley
was
human
not
like
most
profs
and
he
worked
at
his
writing
as
he
had
never
worked
at
anything
running
excepted
since
he
had
been
in
college
the
students
never
knew
what
to
expect
from
henley
in
the
sometimes
he
read
themes
and
criticized
them
sometimes
he
discussed
books
that
he
had
been
reading
sometimes
he
read
poetry
not
because
contemporary
poetry
was
part
of
the
course
but
because
he
happened
to
feel
like
reading
it
that
morning
sometimes
he
discoursed
on
the
art
of
writing
and
sometimes
he
talked
about
anything
that
happened
to
be
occupying
his
mind
he
made
his
an
open
forum
and
the
students
felt
free
to
interrupt
him
at
any
time
and
to
disagree
with
him
usually
they
did
disagree
with
him
and
afterward
wrote
violent
themes
to
prove
that
he
was
wrong
that
was
exactly
what
henley
wanted
them
to
do
and
the
more
he
could
stir
them
up
the
better
satisfied
he
was
one
morning
however
he
talked
without
interruption
he
did
want
to
be
interrupted
and
the
boys
were
so
taken
back
by
his
statements
that
they
could
find
no
words
to
say
anything
the
bell
rang
henley
called
the
roll
stuck
his
into
his
coat
pocket
placed
his
watch
on
the
desk
then
leaned
back
and
looked
the
class
over
your
themes
are
making
me
sick
he
began
nauseated
i
have
a
fairly
strong
stomach
but
there
is
just
so
much
that
i
can
stand
and
you
have
passed
the
limit
there
is
hardly
a
man
in
this
class
who
has
written
at
least
one
theme
on
the
glory
that
is
sanford
as
you
know
i
am
a
sanford
man
myself
and
i
have
my
share
of
affection
for
the
college
but
you
have
reached
an
ecstasy
of
chauvinism
that
makes
affection
for
napoleon
seem
almost
like
contempt
in
the
last
batch
of
themes
i
got
five
telling
me
of
the
perfection
of
sanford
sanford
is
the
greatest
college
in
the
country
sanford
has
the
best
athletes
the
finest
equipment
the
most
erudite
faculty
the
most
perfect
location
the
most
loyal
alumni
the
strongest
spirit
the
most
superlative
everything
nonsense
rot
bunk
sanford
has
anything
of
the
sort
and
i
who
love
it
say
so
sanford
is
a
good
little
college
but
it
is
a
harvard
a
yale
or
a
princeton
or
for
that
matter
a
dartmouth
or
brown
and
those
colleges
still
have
perfection
ahead
of
them
sanford
has
made
a
place
for
itself
in
the
sun
but
it
will
never
find
a
bigger
place
so
long
as
its
sons
do
nothing
but
chant
its
praises
and
condemn
any
one
as
disloyal
who
happens
to
mention
its
very
numerous
faults
well
i
going
to
mention
some
of
those
faults
not
all
of
them
by
any
means
just
those
that
any
intelligent
undergraduate
ought
to
be
able
to
see
for
himself
in
the
first
place
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
educational
institution
it
is
endowed
for
that
purpose
and
it
advertises
itself
as
such
and
you
men
say
that
you
come
here
to
get
an
education
but
what
do
you
really
do
you
resist
education
with
all
your
might
and
main
digging
your
heels
into
the
gravel
of
your
own
ignorance
and
fighting
any
attempt
to
teach
you
anything
every
inch
of
the
way
what
worse
you
content
with
your
own
ignorance
you
insist
that
every
one
else
be
ignorant
too
suppose
a
man
attempts
to
acquire
culture
as
some
of
them
do
what
happens
he
is
branded
as
wet
he
is
a
social
leper
wet
what
currency
that
bit
of
slang
has
and
what
awful
power
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
find
out
what
the
word
meant
but
after
long
research
i
think
that
i
know
a
man
is
wet
if
he
is
a
guy
he
is
wet
if
he
is
he
is
wet
if
he
has
intellectual
interests
and
lets
the
mob
discover
them
and
strangely
enough
he
is
wet
by
the
same
token
if
he
is
utterly
stupid
he
is
wet
if
he
does
show
at
least
a
tendency
to
dissipate
but
he
is
wet
if
he
dissipates
to
excess
a
man
will
be
branded
as
wet
for
any
of
these
reasons
and
once
he
is
so
branded
he
might
as
well
leave
college
if
he
does
he
will
have
a
lonely
and
hard
row
to
hoe
it
is
a
rare
undergraduate
who
can
stand
the
open
contempt
of
his
fellows
he
paused
obviously
ordering
his
thoughts
before
continuing
the
boys
waited
expectantly
some
of
them
were
angry
some
amused
a
few
in
agreement
and
all
of
them
intensely
interested
henley
leaned
back
in
his
chair
what
horrible
little
conformers
you
are
he
began
sarcastically
and
how
you
loathe
any
one
who
conform
you
dress
both
your
bodies
and
your
minds
to
some
set
model
just
at
present
you
are
making
your
hair
foul
with
some
sort
of
perfumed
nine
tenths
of
you
part
it
in
the
middle
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
style
is
becoming
to
you
or
not
you
slick
it
down
and
part
it
in
the
middle
last
year
nobody
did
it
the
chances
are
that
next
year
nobody
will
do
it
but
anybody
who
does
do
it
right
now
is
in
danger
of
being
called
wet
hugh
had
a
moment
of
satisfaction
he
did
not
pomade
his
hair
and
he
parted
it
on
the
side
as
he
had
when
he
came
to
college
true
he
had
tried
the
new
fashion
but
after
scanning
himself
carefully
in
the
mirror
he
decided
that
he
looked
like
a
blond
wop
and
washed
his
hair
he
was
guilty
however
of
the
next
crime
mentioned
the
same
thing
is
true
of
clothes
henley
was
saying
last
year
every
one
wore
suits
and
very
severe
trousers
this
year
every
one
is
wearing
norfolk
jackets
and
trousers
absurd
things
that
flop
around
the
shoes
and
some
of
them
all
but
trail
on
the
ground
now
any
one
who
ca
afford
the
latest
creation
or
who
declines
to
wear
it
is
promptly
called
wet
and
as
i
said
before
you
insist
on
the
same
standardization
of
your
minds
just
now
it
is
not
to
like
poetry
a
man
who
does
is
exceedingly
wet
indeed
he
is
effeminate
a
sissy
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
you
like
poetry
very
much
you
never
give
me
such
good
attention
as
when
i
read
poetry
what
more
some
of
you
are
writing
the
disgraceful
stuff
but
what
happens
when
a
man
does
submit
a
poem
as
a
theme
he
writes
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
do
not
read
this
in
class
some
of
you
write
that
because
you
do
think
that
the
poem
is
very
good
but
most
of
you
are
afraid
of
the
contempt
of
your
classmates
i
know
of
any
number
of
men
in
this
college
who
read
vast
quantities
of
poetry
but
always
on
the
sly
just
think
of
that
men
pay
thousands
of
dollars
and
give
four
years
of
their
lives
supposedly
to
acquire
culture
and
then
have
to
sneak
off
into
a
corner
to
read
poetry
who
are
your
college
gods
the
brilliant
men
who
are
thinking
and
learning
the
men
with
ideals
and
aspirations
not
by
a
long
shot
they
are
the
athletes
some
of
the
athletes
happen
to
be
as
intelligent
and
as
eager
to
learn
as
anybody
else
but
a
fair
number
are
here
simply
because
they
are
paid
to
come
to
play
football
or
baseball
or
what
not
and
they
are
worshiped
bowed
down
to
cheered
and
adored
the
brilliant
men
unless
they
happen
to
be
very
in
the
bargain
are
considered
wet
and
are
ostracized
such
is
the
college
that
you
write
themes
about
to
tell
me
that
it
is
perfect
the
college
is
made
up
of
men
who
worship
mediocrity
that
is
their
ideal
except
in
athletics
the
condition
of
the
football
field
is
a
thousand
times
more
important
to
the
undergraduates
and
the
alumni
than
the
number
of
books
in
the
library
or
the
quality
of
the
faculty
the
fraternities
will
fight
each
other
to
pledge
an
athlete
but
i
have
yet
to
see
them
raise
any
dust
over
a
man
who
was
merely
intelligent
i
tell
you
that
you
have
false
standards
false
ideals
and
that
you
have
a
false
loyalty
to
the
college
the
college
can
stand
criticism
it
will
thrive
and
grow
on
it
but
it
wo
grow
on
blind
adoration
i
tell
you
further
that
you
are
as
standardized
as
fords
and
about
as
ornamental
fords
are
useful
for
ordinary
work
so
are
you
and
unless
some
of
you
wake
up
and
as
you
would
say
hep
to
yourselves
you
are
never
going
to
be
anything
more
than
human
fords
you
pride
yourselves
on
being
the
cream
of
the
earth
the
noblest
work
of
god
you
are
told
so
constantly
you
are
the
intellectual
aristocracy
of
america
the
men
who
are
going
to
lead
the
masses
to
a
brighter
and
broader
vision
of
life
merciful
heavens
preserve
us
you
swagger
around
utterly
contemptuous
of
the
man
who
has
gone
to
college
you
talk
magnificently
about
democracy
but
you
scorn
the
man
and
you
try
pathetically
to
imitate
yale
and
princeton
and
i
suppose
yale
and
princeton
are
trying
to
imitate
fifth
avenue
and
newport
democracy
rot
this
college
is
democratic
certain
fraternities
condescend
to
other
fraternities
and
those
fraternities
barely
deign
even
to
condescend
to
the
men
you
say
hello
to
everybody
on
the
campus
and
think
that
you
are
democratic
do
fool
yourselves
and
do
try
to
fool
me
if
you
want
to
write
some
themes
about
sanford
that
have
some
sense
and
truth
in
them
some
honest
observation
go
ahead
but
do
pass
in
any
more
chauvinistic
bunk
i
sick
of
it
he
put
his
watch
in
his
pocket
and
stood
up
you
may
belong
to
the
intellectual
aristocracy
of
the
country
but
i
doubt
it
you
may
lead
the
masses
to
a
and
better
life
but
i
doubt
it
you
may
be
the
cream
of
the
earth
but
i
doubt
it
all
i
got
to
say
is
this
if
you
the
cream
of
the
earth

he
stepped
down
from
the
rostrum
and
briskly
left
the
room
for
an
instant
the
boys
sat
silent
and
then
suddenly
there
was
a
rustle
of
excitement
some
of
them
laughed
some
of
them
swore
softly
and
most
of
them
began
to
talk
they
pulled
on
their
coats
and
left
the
room
chattering
he
certainly
has
the
dope
said
pudge
jamieson
we
a
lot
of
pretending
to
be
intellectual
we
intellectual
hypocrites
that
what
we
are
how
do
you
get
that
way
ferdy
hillman
who
was
walking
with
hugh
and
pudge
demanded
angrily
we
may
not
be
so
hot
but
we
a
damn
sight
better
than
these
guys
that
work
in
offices
and
mills
jimmie
henley
gives
me
a
pain
he
shoots
off
his
gab
as
if
he
knew
everything
got
to
show
me
where
other
colleges
have
anything
on
sanford
he
a
hell
of
a
sanford
man
he
is
they
were
walking
slowly
down
the
stairs
george
winsor
caught
up
with
them
what
did
you
think
of
it
george
hugh
asked
winsor
grinned
he
gave
me
some
awful
body
blows
he
said
chuckling
cripes
i
felt
most
of
the
time
that
he
was
talking
only
to
me
sore
all
over
what
did
you
think
of
it
jimmie
a
live
wire
all
right
i
do
know
what
to
think
hugh
replied
soberly
he
knocked
all
the
props
from
under
me
i
got
to
think
it
over
he
did
think
it
over
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
was
inclined
to
believe
that
henley
was
right
he
carried
statements
to
their
final
conclusion
and
decided
that
the
college
was
a
colossal
failure
he
wrote
a
theme
and
said
so
you
wrong
hugh
henley
said
when
he
read
the
theme
sanford
has
real
virtues
a
bushel
of
them
you
discover
them
all
right
before
you
graduate
chapter
xviii
sanford
virtues
were
hard
for
hugh
to
find
and
they
grew
more
inconspicuous
as
the
term
advanced
for
the
time
being
nothing
seemed
worth
while
he
was
disgusted
with
himself
the
undergraduates
and
the
fraternity
he
felt
that
the
college
had
bilked
him
often
he
thought
of
the
talk
he
had
had
with
his
father
before
he
left
for
college
sometimes
that
talk
seemed
funny
entirely
idiotic
but
sometimes
it
infuriated
him
what
right
had
his
father
to
send
him
off
to
college
with
such
fool
ideas
in
his
head
nu
delta
the
perfect
brotherhood
bull
how
did
his
father
get
that
way
anyhow
hugh
had
yet
to
learn
that
nearly
every
chapter
changes
character
at
least
once
a
decade
and
that
nu
delta
thirty
years
earlier
had
been
an
entirely
different
organization
from
what
it
was
at
present
at
times
he
felt
that
his
father
had
deliberately
deceived
him
but
in
quieter
moments
he
knew
better
then
he
realized
that
his
father
was
a
dreamer
and
an
innocent
a
delicately
minded
man
who
had
never
really
known
anything
about
sanford
college
or
the
world
either
hugh
often
felt
older
and
wiser
than
his
father
and
in
many
ways
he
was
in
march
he
angered
his
fraternity
brothers
again
by
refusing
a
part
in
the
annual
musical
comedy
which
was
staged
by
the
dramatic
society
during
prom
week
hugh
tenor
singing
voice
and
rather
small
features
made
him
an
excellent
possibility
for
a
woman
part
but
he
was
not
a
good
actor
and
he
knew
it
his
attempts
at
acting
in
a
play
had
resulted
in
a
flat
failure
and
he
had
no
intention
of
publicly
making
a
fool
of
himself
again
besides
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
appearing
on
the
stage
as
a
girl
the
mere
idea
was
offensive
to
him
therefore
when
the
society
offered
him
a
part
he
declined
it
bob
tucker
took
him
severely
to
task
what
do
you
mean
hugh
he
demanded
by
turning
down
the
dramat
here
you
got
a
chance
for
a
lead
and
you
turn
up
your
nose
at
it
as
if
you
were
god
almighty
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
getting
lately
you
run
around
with
a
bunch
of
thoroughly
wet
ones
you
never
come
to
fraternity
meetings
if
you
can
help
it
you
are
half
training
down
at
the
track
and
now
you
give
the
dramat
the
air
just
as
if
an
activity
or
two
anything
in
your
young
life
the
dramat
is
anything
to
me
hugh
replied
trying
to
keep
his
temper
tucker
arrogance
always
made
him
angry
i
ca
act
worth
a
damn
never
could
i
tried
once
in
a
play
at
home
and
made
a
poor
fish
of
myself
and
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
that
i
not
going
to
again
bunk
tucker
ejaculated
contemptuously
hooey
anybody
can
act
good
enough
for
the
dramat
i
tell
you
right
now
that
you
turning
the
fraternity
down
you
playing
us
dirt
what
have
you
done
in
college
not
a
goddamn
thing
except
make
the
glee
club
i
do
care
about
track
i
suppose
you
did
your
best
last
year
though
i
know
damn
well
that
you
are
doing
it
this
year
what
would
become
of
the
fraternity
if
all
of
us
parked
ourselves
on
our
tails
and
gave
the
activities
the
air
the
way
you
do
you
throwing
us
down
and
we
do
like
it
well
i
not
going
out
for
the
dramat
hugh
mumbled
sullenly
you
can
just
bet
on
that
i
admit
that
i
have
trained
the
way
i
ought
to
but
i
have
made
the
glee
club
and
i
have
promised
to
join
the
banjo
club
and
i
am
still
on
the
track
squad
and
that
more
than
half
the
fellows
in
this
fraternity
can
say
most
of
do
do
anything
but
go
on
parties
and
raise
hell
generally
how
come
you
picking
on
me
why
do
you
ride
some
of
them
for
a
while
i
do
see
where
they
so
hot
never
mind
the
other
fellows
tucker
black
eyes
flashed
angrily
he
was
one
of
the
himself
good
looking
always
beautifully
dressed
and
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
was
rated
the
smoothest
man
on
the
campus
his
smoothness
had
made
him
prominent
in
activities
that
and
his
estimate
of
himself
he
took
it
for
granted
that
he
would
be
prominent
and
the
students
accepted
him
at
his
own
valuation
and
powerful
nu
delta
had
been
behind
him
always
able
to
swing
votes
when
votes
were
needed
never
mind
the
other
fellows
he
repeated
they
none
of
your
party
you
got
talents
and
you
not
making
use
of
them
you
could
be
as
popular
as
the
devil
if
you
wanted
to
but
you
go
chasing
around
with
kikes
and
micks
hugh
was
very
angry
and
a
little
absurd
in
his
youthful
pomposity
i
suppose
you
refer
to
parker
and
einstein
my
one
mick
friend
although
he
is
irish
and
my
one
jewish
friend
well
i
shall
stick
to
them
and
see
just
as
much
of
them
as
i
like
i
told
you
that
before
and
you
might
as
well
get
me
straight
right
now
i
going
to
run
with
whoever
i
want
the
fraternity
can
not
dictate
to
me
about
my
friends
you
told
me
you
did
want
parker
and
einstein
around
the
house
i
do
bring
them
around
i
do
see
as
how
you
got
a
right
to
ask
anything
more
i
do
suppose
you
realize
that
everything
you
do
reflects
on
the
fraternity
tucker
retorted
slightly
pompous
himself
i
suppose
it
does
but
i
ca
see
that
i
have
done
anything
that
is
going
to
ruin
the
name
of
nu
delta
i
do
get
potted
regularly
or
chase
around
with
filthy
bags
or
flunk
my
courses
or
crib
my
way
through
and
i
could
mention
some
men
in
this
house
who
do
all
those
things
hugh
was
thoroughly
angry
and
no
longer
in
possession
of
his
best
judgment
if
you
do
like
the
way
i
act
you
can
have
my
pin
any
time
you
say
he
stood
up
his
blue
eyes
almost
black
with
rage
his
cheeks
flushed
his
mouth
a
thin
white
line
tucker
realized
that
he
had
gone
too
far
oh
do
get
sore
hugh
he
said
soothingly
i
did
mean
it
the
way
you
are
taking
it
of
course
we
do
want
you
to
turn
in
your
pin
we
all
like
you
we
just
want
you
to
come
around
more
and
be
one
of
the
fellows
more
of
a
regular
guy
we
feel
that
you
can
bring
a
lot
of
honor
to
the
fraternity
if
you
want
to
and
we
been
kinda
sore
because
you
been
giving
activities
the
how
about
my
studies
hugh
retorted
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
give
them
the
air
well
i
did
the
first
term
and
i
made
a
record
that
i
was
ashamed
of
i
promised
my
folks
that
i
do
better
and
i
going
to
i
give
an
hour
or
two
a
day
to
track
and
several
hours
a
week
to
the
glee
club
and
now
i
going
to
have
to
give
several
more
to
the
banjo
club
that
all
i
can
give
at
present
and
that
all
i
going
to
give
i
know
perfectly
well
that
some
fellows
can
go
out
for
a
bunch
of
activities
and
make
phi
bete
too
but
they
sharks
and
i
not
worry
either
i
wo
disgrace
the
fraternity
by
making
phi
bete
he
concluded
sarcastically
oh
calm
down
hugh
and
forget
what
i
said
tucker
pleaded
thoroughly
sorry
that
he
had
started
the
argument
you
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
think
right
and
we
stand
by
you
he
stood
up
and
put
his
hand
on
hugh
shoulder
no
hard
feelings
are
there
old
man
kindness
always
melted
hugh
no
matter
how
angry
he
was
he
could
not
resist
it
no
he
said
softly
no
hard
feelings
i
sorry
i
lost
my
temper
tucker
patted
his
shoulder
oh
that
all
right
i
guess
i
kinda
lost
mine
too
you
be
around
to
the
meeting
night
wo
you
better
come
paying
fines
do
get
you
anywhere
sure
i
come
he
went
but
took
no
part
in
the
discussion
nor
did
he
frequent
the
fraternity
house
any
more
than
he
had
previously
more
and
more
he
realized
that
he
had
gone
with
the
wrong
crowd
and
more
and
more
he
thought
of
what
graham
had
said
to
him
in
his
freshman
year
about
how
a
man
was
in
hell
if
he
joined
the
wrong
fraternity
i
was
the
wise
bird
he
told
himself
caustically
i
was
the
guy
who
knew
all
about
it
graham
saw
what
would
happen
and
i
did
have
sense
enough
to
take
his
advice
hell
i
never
even
thought
about
what
he
told
me
i
knew
that
i
would
be
in
heaven
if
nu
delta
gave
me
a
bid
heaven
well
i
glad
that
they
were
too
for
norry
parker
and
that
he
went
with
the
right
bunch
norville
parker
was
hugh
catholic
friend
and
the
more
he
saw
of
the
freshman
the
better
he
liked
him
parker
had
received
several
bids
from
fraternities
and
he
followed
the
advice
hugh
had
given
him
if
delta
sigma
delta
bids
you
go
there
hugh
had
said
positively
they
the
bunch
you
belong
with
apparently
the
kappa
zetes
are
going
to
bid
you
too
you
go
delta
sig
if
you
get
the
chance
hugh
envied
parker
the
really
beautiful
fraternity
life
he
was
leading
why
in
god
name
he
demanded
of
himself
regularly
did
i
have
sense
enough
to
take
graham
advice
when
spring
came
the
two
boys
took
long
walks
into
the
country
both
of
them
loving
the
new
beauty
of
the
spring
and
happy
in
perfect
companionship
hugh
missed
carl
badly
and
he
wanted
to
ask
parker
to
room
with
him
the
remainder
of
the
term
he
felt
however
that
the
fraternity
would
object
and
he
wanted
no
further
trouble
with
nu
delta
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
fraternity
would
have
said
nothing
but
hugh
had
become
hypersensitive
and
expected
his
brothers
to
find
fault
with
his
every
move
he
had
no
intention
of
deserting
parker
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
rooming
with
him
would
be
a
gratuitous
insult
to
the
fraternity
parker
every
one
called
him
norry
was
a
slender
delicate
lad
with
dreamy
gray
eyes
and
silky
brown
hair
that
unless
he
brushed
it
back
severely
fell
in
soft
curls
on
his
extraordinarily
white
forehead
except
for
a
slightly
aquiline
nose
and
a
firm
jaw
he
was
almost
effeminate
in
appearance
his
mouth
was
so
sensitive
his
hands
so
white
and
slender
his
manner
so
gentle
he
had
a
slow
winning
smile
a
quiet
low
voice
he
was
a
dreamer
and
a
mystic
a
youth
who
could
see
fairies
dancing
in
the
shadows
and
he
told
hugh
what
he
saw
i
see
things
he
said
to
hugh
one
moonlight
night
as
they
strolled
through
the
woods
i
see
things
lovely
little
creatures
flitting
around
among
the
trees
i
mean
i
see
them
when
i
alone
i
like
to
lie
on
my
back
in
the
meadows
and
look
at
the
clouds
and
imagine
myself
sitting
on
a
big
fellow
and
sailing
and
sailing
away
to
heaven
wonderful
i
feel
that
way
when
i
play
my
fiddle
he
played
the
violin
beautifully
and
had
promptly
been
made
soloist
for
the
musical
clubs
i
i
ca
explain
sometimes
when
i
finish
playing
i
find
my
eyes
full
of
tears
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
to
some
wonderful
place
and
i
do
want
to
come
back
i
guess
i
not
like
other
fellows
i
cry
over
poetry
not
because
it
makes
me
sad
it
not
that
it
just
so
beautiful
why
when
i
first
read
shelley
i
was
almost
sick
i
was
so
happy
i
could
hardly
stand
it
and
when
i
hear
beautiful
music
i
cry
too
why
when
i
listen
to
kreisler
i
sometimes
want
to
beg
him
to
stop
it
hurts
and
makes
me
so
happy
that
that
i
just
ca
stand
it
he
finished
lamely
i
know
hugh
said
i
know
how
it
is
i
feel
that
way
sometimes
too
but
not
as
much
as
you
i
guess
i
do
cry
i
never
really
cry
but
i
want
to
once
in
a
while
i
i
write
poetry
sometimes
he
confessed
awkwardly
but
i
guess
it
not
very
good
jimmie
henley
says
it
so
bad
for
a
sophomore
but
i
afraid
that
he
just
stringing
me
along
trying
to
encourage
me
you
know
but
there
are
times
when
said
a
little
bit
right
just
a
little
bit
but
i
known
that
it
was
right
and
then
i
feel
the
way
you
do
i
written
lots
of
poetry
norry
said
simply
but
it
no
good
it
never
any
good
he
paused
between
two
big
trees
and
pointed
upward
look
look
up
there
see
those
black
branches
and
that
patch
of
sky
between
them
and
those
stars
i
want
to
picture
that
and
i
ca
and
i
want
to
picture
the
trees
the
way
they
look
now
so
fluffy
with
tiny
new
leaves
but
i
miss
it
a
million
miles
but
i
can
get
it
in
music
he
added
more
brightly
grieg
says
it
music
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
i
wish
i
could
be
a
great
violinist
i
ca
though
i
not
a
genius
and
i
not
strong
enough
i
practice
very
long
they
continued
walking
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
norry
said
i
awfully
happy
here
at
college
and
i
did
expect
to
be
either
i
knew
that
i
was
kinda
different
from
other
fellows
not
so
strong
and
i
do
like
ugly
things
or
smutty
stories
or
anything
like
that
i
think
women
are
lovely
and
i
hate
to
hear
fellows
tell
dirty
stories
about
them
i
no
fool
hugh
i
know
about
the
things
that
happen
but
i
do
want
to
hear
about
them
things
that
are
dirty
and
ugly
make
me
feel
sick
well
i
was
afraid
the
fellows
would
razz
me
but
they
do
they
do
at
all
the
fellows
over
at
the
delta
sig
house
are
wonderful
to
me
they
do
think
i
wet
they
do
razz
me
for
not
going
on
wild
parties
though
i
know
that
some
of
the
fellows
are
pretty
gay
themselves
they
ask
me
to
fiddle
for
them
nearly
every
evening
and
they
sit
and
listen
very
very
quietly
just
as
long
as
i
play
glad
you
told
me
to
go
delta
sig
norry
made
hugh
feel
very
old
and
a
little
crude
and
hard
he
realized
that
there
was
something
rare
almost
exquisite
about
the
boy
and
that
he
lived
largely
in
a
beautiful
world
of
his
own
imagination
it
would
have
surprised
norry
if
any
one
had
told
him
that
his
fraternity
brothers
stood
in
awe
of
him
that
they
thought
he
was
a
genius
some
of
them
were
built
out
of
pretty
common
clay
but
they
felt
the
almost
unearthly
purity
of
the
boy
they
had
made
a
brother
and
the
hardest
of
them
the
crudest
silently
elected
himself
the
guardian
of
that
purity
chapter
xix
hugh
found
real
happiness
in
norry
parker
companionship
and
such
men
as
burbank
and
winsor
were
giving
him
a
more
robust
but
no
less
pleasant
friendship
they
were
earnest
youths
eager
and
alive
curious
about
the
world
reading
discussing
all
sorts
of
topics
vigorously
and
yet
far
more
of
the
earth
earthy
than
parker
who
was
so
mystical
and
dreamy
that
constant
association
with
him
would
have
been
something
of
a
strain
for
a
time
life
seemed
to
settle
down
into
a
pleasant
groove
of
studies
that
took
not
too
much
time
movies
concerts
an
occasional
play
by
the
dramatic
society
perhaps
a
slumming
party
to
a
dance
in
hastings
saturday
nights
bull
sessions
long
talks
with
henley
in
his
office
or
at
his
home
running
on
the
track
and
some
reading
for
a
week
or
two
life
was
lifted
out
of
the
groove
by
a
daughter
burbank
introduced
hugh
to
her
and
at
first
he
was
attracted
by
her
calm
dignity
he
called
three
times
and
then
gave
her
up
in
despair
her
dignity
hid
an
utterly
blank
mind
she
was
as
uninteresting
as
her
father
and
he
had
the
reputation
well
deserved
of
being
the
dullest
lecturer
on
the
campus
only
one
event
disturbed
the
pleasant
calm
of
hugh
life
after
his
argument
with
tucker
he
did
not
attend
prom
because
he
knew
no
girl
whom
he
cared
to
ask
he
failed
again
to
make
his
letter
and
took
his
failure
philosophically
and
he
received
a
note
from
janet
harton
telling
him
that
she
was
engaged
to
the
most
wonderful
man
in
the
world
and
he
did
give
a
hoot
if
she
was
just
after
easter
vacation
the
nu
deltas
gave
their
annual
house
dance
hugh
looked
forward
to
it
with
considerable
pleasure
true
he
was
not
dragging
a
woman
but
several
of
the
brothers
were
going
stag
so
he
felt
completely
at
ease
the
freshmen
were
put
to
work
cleaning
the
house
the
curtains
were
sent
to
the
laundry
bedroom
closets
and
dresser
drawers
were
emptied
of
anything
the
girls
might
find
too
interesting
and
an
enormously
expensive
orchestra
was
imported
from
new
york
finally
a
number
of
young
alumni
the
four
patronesses
and
the
girls
appeared
getting
dressed
for
the
dance
was
a
real
event
in
hugh
life
he
had
worn
evening
clothes
only
a
few
times
before
but
those
occasions
fraternity
banquets
and
glee
club
concerts
were
he
felt
relatively
unimportant
the
dance
however
was
different
and
he
felt
that
he
must
look
his
best
his
very
smoothest
he
was
a
rare
undergraduate
he
owned
everything
necessary
to
wear
to
an
evening
function
at
least
everything
an
undergraduate
considered
necessary
he
did
not
own
a
and
he
would
have
had
no
use
for
it
if
he
had
only
tuxedos
were
worn
he
dressed
with
great
care
tying
and
retying
his
tie
until
it
was
knotted
perfectly
when
at
last
he
drew
on
his
jacket
he
looked
himself
over
in
the
mirror
with
considerable
satisfaction
he
knew
that
he
was
dressed
right
it
hardly
entered
his
mind
that
he
was
an
exceedingly
young
man
vanity
was
not
one
of
his
faults
but
he
had
good
reason
to
be
pleased
with
the
image
he
was
examining
for
any
sartorial
defects
he
had
brushed
his
sandy
brown
hair
until
it
shone
his
shave
had
left
his
slender
cheeks
almost
as
smooth
as
a
girl
his
blue
eyes
were
very
bright
and
clear
and
the
black
suit
emphasized
his
blond
cleanness
it
was
a
attractive
youth
who
finally
pulled
on
his
and
started
happily
across
the
campus
for
the
nu
delta
house
the
dance
was
just
starting
when
he
arrived
the
patronesses
were
in
the
library
a
small
room
off
the
hugh
learned
later
that
six
men
had
been
delegated
to
keep
the
patronesses
in
the
library
and
adequately
entertained
the
men
worked
in
shifts
and
although
the
dance
lasted
until
three
the
next
morning
not
a
patroness
got
a
chance
to
wander
unchaperoned
around
the
house
the
of
the
nu
delta
house
was
so
large
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
use
the
for
a
dance
therefore
most
of
the
big
chairs
and
divans
had
been
moved
into
the
and
the
was
dark
hugh
permitted
himself
to
be
presented
to
the
patronesses
mumbled
a
few
polite
words
and
then
joined
the
stag
line
waiting
for
a
chance
to
cut
in
presently
a
couple
moved
slowly
by
so
slowly
that
they
did
not
seem
to
move
at
all
the
girl
was
hester
sheville
and
hugh
had
been
introduced
to
her
in
the
afternoon
despite
rather
uneven
features
and
red
hair
she
was
almost
pretty
and
in
her
green
evening
gown
which
was
cut
daringly
low
she
was
flashing
and
attractive
hugh
stepped
forward
and
tapped
her
partner
on
the
shoulder
the
brother
released
her
with
a
grimace
at
hugh
and
hester
without
a
word
put
her
right
hand
in
hugh
left
and
slipped
her
left
arm
around
his
neck
they
danced
in
silence
for
a
time
bodies
pressed
close
together
swaying
in
place
hardly
advancing
presently
however
hester
drew
her
head
back
and
spoke
hot
stuff
is
it
she
asked
lazily
hugh
was
startled
her
breath
was
redolent
of
whisky
sure
is
he
replied
and
executed
a
difficult
step
the
girl
following
him
without
the
slightest
difficulty
she
danced
remarkably
but
he
was
glad
when
he
was
tapped
on
the
shoulder
and
another
brother
claimed
hester
the
whisky
breath
had
repelled
him
as
the
evening
wore
on
he
danced
with
a
good
many
girls
who
had
whisky
breaths
one
girl
clung
to
him
as
they
danced
and
whispered
hold
me
up
kid
i
ginned
he
had
to
rush
a
third
a
dainty
blond
child
to
the
porch
railing
she
was
a
pretty
sight
as
she
vomited
into
the
garden
nor
did
hugh
find
her
gasped
comment
the
seas
are
rough
amusing
another
girl
went
sound
asleep
in
a
chair
and
had
to
be
carried
and
put
to
bed
a
number
of
the
brothers
were
hilarious
a
few
had
drunk
too
much
and
were
sick
one
had
a
crying
jag
there
were
men
there
however
who
were
not
drinking
at
all
and
they
were
making
gallant
efforts
to
keep
the
sober
girls
away
from
the
less
sober
girls
and
the
inebriated
brothers
hugh
was
not
drinking
the
idea
of
drinking
at
a
dance
was
offensive
to
him
he
thought
it
insulting
to
the
girls
the
fact
that
some
of
the
girls
were
drinking
horrified
him
he
did
mind
their
smoking
well
not
very
much
but
drinking
that
was
going
altogether
too
far
about
midnight
he
danced
again
with
hester
sheville
not
because
he
wanted
to
but
because
she
had
insisted
he
had
been
standing
gloomily
in
the
doorway
watching
the
bacchanalian
scene
listening
to
the
of
the
drums
when
she
came
up
to
him
i
wanta
dance
she
said
huskily
i
wanta
dance
with
you
you
you
blond
beast
seeing
no
way
to
decline
to
dance
with
the
girl
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
started
off
hester
tongue
was
no
longer
in
control
but
her
feet
followed
his
unerringly
when
the
music
stopped
she
whispered
take
me
me
to
th
th
wonderingly
hugh
led
her
across
the
hall
he
had
not
been
in
the
since
the
dance
started
and
he
was
amazed
and
shocked
to
find
half
a
dozen
couples
in
the
big
chairs
or
on
the
divans
in
close
embrace
he
paused
but
hester
led
him
to
an
empty
chair
shoved
him
clumsily
down
into
it
and
then
flopped
down
on
his
lap
le
le
pet
she
whispered
i
wan
na
pet
again
hugh
smelled
the
whisky
fumes
as
she
put
her
hot
mouth
to
his
and
kissed
him
hungrily
he
was
angry
angry
and
humiliated
he
tried
to
get
up
to
force
the
girl
off
of
his
lap
but
she
clung
tenaciously
to
him
striving
insistently
to
kiss
him
on
the
mouth
finally
hugh
anger
got
the
better
of
his
manners
he
stood
up
the
girl
hanging
to
his
neck
literally
tore
her
arms
off
of
him
took
her
by
the
waist
and
set
her
down
firmly
in
the
chair
sit
there
he
said
softly
viciously
sit
there
she
began
to
cry
and
he
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
his
cheeks
flaming
and
his
eyes
flashing
and
the
embracing
couples
paid
no
attention
to
him
at
all
he
had
to
pass
the
door
of
the
library
to
get
his
he
made
up
his
mind
to
get
out
of
the
goddamned
house
and
was
walking
quickly
by
the
door
when
one
of
the
patronesses
called
to
him
oh
mr
carver
will
you
come
here
a
minute
surely
mrs
reynolds
he
entered
the
library
and
waited
before
the
dowager
i
left
my
wrap
in
merrill
room
i
think
it
is
i
am
getting
a
little
chilly
wo
you
get
it
for
me
of
course
it
in
merrill
room
i
think
it
is
it
right
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
wrap
blue
with
white
fur
hugh
ran
up
the
stairs
opened
merrill
door
switched
on
the
lights
and
immediately
spotted
the
wrap
lying
over
the
back
of
a
chair
he
picked
it
up
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
a
noise
behind
him
attracted
his
attention
he
turned
and
saw
a
man
and
a
girl
lying
on
the
bed
watching
him
hugh
stared
blankly
at
them
his
mouth
half
open
get
th
hell
out
of
here
the
man
said
roughly
for
an
instant
hugh
continued
to
stare
then
he
whirled
about
walked
out
of
the
room
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
he
delivered
the
wrap
to
reynolds
and
two
minutes
later
he
was
out
of
the
house
walking
almost
running
across
the
campus
to
surrey
hall
once
there
he
tore
off
his
his
jacket
his
collar
and
tie
and
threw
himself
down
into
a
chair
so
this
was
college
this
was
the
fraternity
that
goddamned
rat
house
that
was
what
he
had
pledged
allegiance
to
was
it
those
were
his
brothers
were
they
brothers
brothers
he
fairly
leaped
out
of
his
chair
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
college
gentlemen
a
lot
of
muckers
chasing
around
with
a
bunch
of
rats
what
they
were
great
thing
fraternities
no
doubt
about
it
they
were
a
great
institution
he
paused
in
his
mental
tirade
suddenly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
fair
some
of
the
fraternities
he
knew
would
never
stand
for
any
such
performance
as
he
had
witnessed
that
evening
most
of
them
he
was
sure
would
it
was
just
the
nu
deltas
and
one
or
two
others
well
maybe
three
or
four
so
that
what
he
had
joined
was
it
he
thought
of
hester
sheville
of
her
whisky
breath
her
lascivious
pawing
and
his
hands
clenched
filthy
little
rat
he
said
aloud
the
stinkin
rotten
rat
then
he
remembered
that
there
had
been
girls
there
who
had
drunk
anything
girls
who
somehow
managed
to
move
through
the
whole
orgy
calm
and
sweet
his
anger
mounted
it
was
a
hell
of
a
way
to
treat
a
decent
girl
to
ask
her
to
a
dance
with
a
lot
of
drunkards
and
soused
rats
he
was
warm
with
anger
reckless
of
the
buttons
he
tore
off
his
waistcoat
and
threw
it
on
a
chair
the
jeweled
fraternity
pin
by
the
pocket
caught
his
eye
he
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
unpinned
it
he
let
it
lie
in
his
hand
and
addressed
it
aloud
hardly
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
speaking
at
all
so
that
what
you
stand
for
is
it
for
snobs
and
politicians
and
muckers
well
i
do
want
any
more
of
you
not
one
damn
bit
more
of
you
he
tossed
the
pin
indifferently
upon
the
making
up
his
mind
that
he
would
resign
from
the
fraternity
the
next
day
when
the
next
day
came
he
found
however
that
his
anger
had
somewhat
abated
he
was
still
indignant
but
he
did
have
the
courage
to
go
through
with
his
resignation
such
an
action
he
knew
would
mean
a
great
deal
of
publicity
publicity
impossible
to
avoid
the
fraternity
would
announce
its
acceptance
of
his
resignation
in
the
sanford
daily
news
and
then
he
would
either
have
to
lie
or
start
a
scandal
as
the
days
went
by
and
he
thought
more
and
more
about
the
dance
he
began
to
doubt
his
indignation
was
he
after
all
a
prude
to
get
so
hot
was
he
perhaps
a
prig
a
sissy
at
times
he
thought
that
he
was
at
other
times
he
was
sure
that
he
was
he
could
be
permanently
sure
of
only
one
thing
that
he
was
a
cynic
chapter
xx
hugh
avoided
the
nu
delta
house
for
the
remainder
of
the
term
and
spent
more
time
on
his
studies
than
he
had
since
he
had
entered
college
the
result
was
of
course
that
he
made
a
good
record
and
the
a
that
henley
gave
him
in
english
delighted
him
so
much
that
he
almost
forgot
his
fraternity
troubles
not
quite
however
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
vacation
he
often
thought
of
talking
to
his
father
about
nu
delta
but
he
could
not
find
the
courage
to
destroy
his
father
illusions
he
found
too
that
he
could
talk
to
his
mother
about
things
that
he
had
seen
and
learned
at
college
like
most
of
his
friends
he
felt
that
the
folks
would
understand
he
spent
the
first
two
months
at
home
working
on
the
farm
but
when
norry
parker
invited
him
to
visit
him
for
a
month
on
long
island
sound
hugh
accepted
the
invitation
and
departed
for
the
parker
summer
cottage
in
high
feather
he
was
eager
to
see
norry
again
but
he
was
even
more
eager
to
see
new
york
he
had
just
celebrated
his
twentieth
birthday
and
he
considered
it
disgraceful
that
he
had
never
visited
the
big
city
as
new
york
was
always
known
at
sanford
norry
met
him
at
grand
central
a
livelier
and
more
robust
norry
than
hugh
had
ever
seen
the
boy
actually
seemed
like
a
boy
and
not
a
sprite
his
cheeks
were
tanned
almost
brown
and
his
gray
eyes
danced
with
excitement
when
he
spotted
hugh
in
the
crowd
gee
hugh
i
glad
to
see
you
he
exclaimed
shaking
hugh
hand
joyously
i
tickled
to
death
that
you
could
come
so
am
i
said
hugh
heartily
really
happy
to
see
norry
looking
so
well
and
thrilled
to
be
in
new
york
gosh
you
look
fine
i
hardly
know
you
where
you
get
all
the
pep
swimming
and
sailing
this
is
the
first
summer
i
been
well
enough
to
swim
all
i
want
to
oh
it
pretty
down
where
we
are
you
love
the
nights
hugh
the
sound
is
wonderful
i
bet
well
where
do
we
go
from
here
say
this
is
certainly
a
whale
of
a
station
is
it
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
hick
oh
you
get
over
that
soon
enough
norry
the
seasoned
new
yorker
assured
him
easily
we
going
right
out
to
the
cottage
it
too
hot
to
run
around
the
city
but
we
come
in
soon
and
you
can
give
it
the
he
took
hugh
arm
and
led
him
out
of
the
station
it
had
never
entered
hugh
mind
that
norry
father
might
be
rich
he
had
noticed
that
norry
clothes
were
very
well
tailored
and
norry
had
told
him
that
his
violin
was
a
cremona
but
the
boy
was
not
lavish
with
money
and
never
talked
about
it
at
all
hugh
was
therefore
surprised
and
a
little
startled
to
see
norry
walk
up
to
an
expensive
limousine
with
a
uniformed
chauffeur
at
the
wheel
he
wondered
if
the
parkers
were
too
for
him
we
go
right
home
martin
norry
said
to
the
chauffeur
get
in
hugh
the
parker
cottage
was
a
short
distance
from
new
rochelle
it
was
a
beautiful
place
hardly
in
the
style
of
a
newport
cottage
but
roomy
and
very
comfortable
it
was
not
far
from
the
water
and
the
parkers
owned
their
own
parker
was
on
the
veranda
when
the
car
drew
up
at
the
steps
hello
mother
norry
called
she
got
up
and
ran
lightly
down
the
steps
her
hand
held
out
in
welcome
to
hugh
i
know
that
you
are
hugh
carver
she
said
in
a
beautifully
modulated
voice
and
i
am
really
delighted
to
meet
you
norry
has
talked
so
much
about
you
that
i
should
have
felt
cheated
if
you
had
come
hugh
fears
immediately
departed
i
should
have
myself
he
replied
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
invite
me
after
meeting
norry
father
and
mother
hugh
understood
the
boy
better
parker
was
both
charming
and
pretty
a
delightful
woman
who
played
the
piano
with
professional
skill
parker
was
an
artist
a
and
he
got
prices
for
his
pictures
that
staggered
hugh
when
norry
mentioned
them
casually
he
was
a
quiet
grave
man
with
gray
eyes
like
his
son
when
he
had
a
minute
alone
with
hugh
he
said
to
him
with
simple
sincerity
you
have
been
very
kind
to
norry
and
we
are
grateful
he
is
a
strange
poetic
lad
who
needs
the
kind
of
understanding
friendship
you
have
given
him
we
should
have
been
deeply
disappointed
if
you
been
able
to
visit
us
the
expressions
of
gratitude
embarrassed
hugh
but
they
made
him
feel
sure
of
his
welcome
and
once
he
was
sure
of
that
he
began
to
enjoy
himself
as
he
never
had
before
before
the
month
was
out
he
had
made
many
visits
to
new
york
and
was
able
to
talk
about
both
the
ritz
and
macdougal
alley
with
elaborate
casualness
when
he
returned
to
college
he
and
norry
went
swimming
nearly
every
day
and
spent
hours
sailing
on
the
sound
norry
introduced
him
to
the
many
girls
who
had
summer
homes
near
the
parker
cottage
they
were
a
new
type
to
him
products
sure
of
themselves
finished
with
a
high
polish
that
glittered
effectively
daringly
frank
both
in
their
speech
and
their
actions
beautiful
dancers
good
swimmers
full
of
dirt
as
they
called
gossip
and
as
offhand
with
men
as
they
were
with
each
other
within
a
week
hugh
got
over
his
prejudice
against
women
smoking
nearly
every
woman
he
met
including
parker
smoked
and
every
girl
carried
her
most
of
the
girls
treated
norry
as
if
he
were
a
very
nice
small
boy
but
they
adopted
a
different
attitude
toward
hugh
they
flirted
with
him
perfected
his
petting
technique
occasionally
treated
him
to
a
drink
and
made
no
pretense
of
hiding
his
attraction
for
them
at
first
hugh
was
startled
and
a
little
repelled
but
he
soon
grew
to
like
the
frankness
the
petting
and
the
liquor
and
he
was
having
a
much
too
exciting
time
to
pause
often
for
criticism
of
himself
or
anybody
else
it
was
during
the
last
week
of
his
visit
that
he
fell
in
love
he
and
norry
were
standing
near
the
float
watching
a
number
of
swimmers
suddenly
hugh
was
attracted
by
a
girl
he
had
never
seen
before
she
wore
a
red
that
revealed
every
curve
of
her
slender
boyish
figure
she
noticed
norry
and
threw
up
her
arm
in
greeting
who
is
she
hugh
demanded
eagerly
cynthia
day
she
just
back
from
visiting
friends
in
maine
she
an
awfully
good
swimmer
watch
her
the
girl
poised
for
an
instant
on
the
edge
of
the
float
and
then
dived
gracefully
into
the
water
striking
out
with
a
powerful
overhand
stroke
for
another
float
a
quarter
of
a
mile
out
in
the
sound
the
boys
watched
her
red
cap
as
she
rounded
the
float
and
started
back
swimming
easily
and
expertly
when
she
reached
the
beach
she
ran
out
of
the
water
rubbed
her
hands
over
her
face
and
then
strolled
over
to
norry
her
hair
was
concealed
by
a
red
but
hugh
guessed
that
it
was
brown
at
any
rate
her
eyes
were
brown
and
very
large
she
had
an
impudent
little
nose
and
full
red
lips
norry
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
how
the
infant
oh
i
fine
this
is
my
friend
hugh
carver
i
heard
about
you
she
said
as
they
shook
hands
i
only
got
back
last
night
but
everybody
seems
to
be
digging
dirt
about
norry
friend
three
of
my
friends
are
enemies
on
account
of
you
and
one
of
says
she
going
in
swimming
some
day
and
forget
to
come
back
if
you
give
her
a
little
more
time
hugh
blushed
but
he
had
learned
a
few
things
in
the
past
weeks
i
wish
they
would
tell
me
about
it
he
said
with
a
fair
assumption
of
ease
why
did
you
come
back
sooner
he
was
pleased
with
that
speech
he
would
have
dared
it
a
month
before
the
brown
eyes
smiled
at
him
because
i
did
know
you
were
here
you
have
got
a
cigarette
about
you
have
you
norry
useless
when
it
comes
to
smokes
hugh
did
have
a
package
of
cigarettes
she
took
one
put
it
in
her
mouth
and
waited
for
hugh
to
light
it
for
her
when
he
did
she
gazed
curiously
over
the
flame
at
him
she
puffed
the
cigarette
for
a
moment
and
then
said
you
look
like
a
good
egg
let
talk
she
threw
herself
down
on
the
sand
and
the
boys
sat
down
beside
her
from
that
moment
hugh
was
lost
for
the
remaining
days
of
the
visit
he
spent
every
possible
moment
with
cynthia
fascinated
by
her
chatter
thrilled
by
the
touch
of
her
hand
she
made
no
objection
when
he
offered
shyly
to
kiss
her
she
quietly
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
turned
her
face
up
to
his
and
her
kisses
set
him
aflame
for
once
he
did
not
want
to
return
to
college
and
when
he
arrived
in
haydensville
he
felt
none
of
his
usual
enthusiasm
the
initiation
of
the
freshmen
amused
him
only
slightly
and
the
football
games
did
not
seem
so
important
as
they
had
the
two
previous
years
a
letter
from
cynthia
was
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
and
she
wrote
good
letters
chatty
gay
and
affectionate
custom
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
room
in
the
fraternity
house
it
was
an
unwritten
law
of
nu
delta
that
all
members
live
in
the
house
their
last
two
years
and
hugh
hardly
dared
to
contest
the
law
there
were
four
men
in
the
chapter
whom
he
thoroughly
liked
and
with
whom
he
would
have
been
glad
to
room
but
they
all
had
made
their
arrangements
by
the
time
he
spoke
to
them
so
he
was
forced
to
accept
paul
invitation
to
room
with
him
vinton
was
a
cheerful
youth
with
too
much
money
and
not
enough
sense
he
wanted
desperately
to
be
thought
a
good
fellow
a
regular
guy
and
he
was
willing
to
buy
popularity
if
necessary
by
standing
treat
to
any
one
every
chance
he
got
he
was
known
all
over
the
campus
as
a
prize
sucker
he
bored
hugh
excessively
by
his
confidences
and
almost
offensive
generosity
he
always
had
a
supply
of
scotch
whisky
on
hand
and
he
offered
it
to
him
so
constantly
that
hugh
drank
too
much
because
it
was
easier
and
pleasanter
to
drink
than
to
refuse
tucker
had
graduated
and
the
new
president
leonard
gates
was
an
altogether
different
sort
of
man
there
had
been
a
fight
in
the
fraternity
over
his
election
the
regular
guys
opposed
him
and
offered
one
of
their
own
number
as
a
candidate
gates
however
was
prominent
in
campus
activities
and
had
his
own
following
in
the
house
as
a
result
he
was
elected
by
a
slight
margin
he
won
hugh
loyalty
at
the
first
fraternity
meeting
after
he
took
the
chair
some
things
are
going
to
be
changed
in
this
house
he
said
sternly
or
i
will
bring
influence
to
bear
that
will
change
them
every
one
knew
that
he
referred
to
the
national
president
of
the
fraternity
there
will
be
no
more
drunken
brawls
in
this
house
such
as
we
had
at
the
last
house
dance
any
one
who
brings
a
cheap
woman
into
this
house
at
a
dance
will
hear
from
it
both
my
fiancée
and
my
sister
were
at
the
last
dance
i
do
not
intend
that
they
shall
be
insulted
again
this
is
not
a
and
i
want
some
of
you
to
remember
that
he
tried
very
hard
to
pass
a
rule
such
as
many
of
the
fraternities
had
that
no
one
could
bring
liquor
into
the
house
and
that
there
should
be
no
gambling
he
failed
however
the
brothers
took
his
scolding
about
the
dance
because
most
of
them
were
heartily
ashamed
of
that
occasion
but
they
announced
that
they
did
not
intend
to
have
the
chapter
turned
into
the
which
was
the
sanford
christian
association
it
would
have
been
well
for
hugh
if
the
law
had
been
passed
vinton
insistent
generosity
was
rapidly
turning
him
into
a
steady
drinker
he
did
not
get
drunk
but
he
was
taking
down
more
than
were
good
for
him
outside
of
his
drinking
however
he
was
leading
a
virtuous
and
on
the
whole
an
industrious
life
he
was
too
much
in
love
with
cynthia
day
to
let
his
mind
dwell
on
other
women
and
he
had
become
sufficiently
interested
in
his
studies
to
like
them
for
their
own
sake
a
change
had
come
over
the
campus
it
was
inexplicable
but
highly
significant
there
had
been
evidences
of
it
the
year
before
but
now
it
became
so
evident
that
even
some
of
the
members
of
the
faculty
were
aware
of
it
intolerance
seemed
to
be
dying
and
the
word
wet
was
heard
less
often
the
undergraduates
were
forsaking
their
old
gods
the
wave
of
materialism
was
swept
back
by
an
tide
of
idealism
students
suddenly
ceased
to
concentrate
in
economics
and
filled
the
english
and
philosophy
classes
to
overflowing
no
one
was
able
really
to
explain
the
causes
for
the
change
but
it
was
there
and
welcome
the
sanford
literary
magazine
which
had
been
slowly
perishing
for
several
years
became
almost
as
popular
as
the
cap
and
bells
the
comic
magazine
which
coined
money
by
publishing
risque
jokes
and
pictures
of
slightly
dressed
women
a
poetry
magazine
daringly
made
its
appearance
on
the
campus
and
to
the
surprise
of
its
editors
was
received
so
cordially
that
they
were
able
to
pay
the
printer
bill
it
became
the
fashion
to
read
instructors
in
english
were
continually
being
asked
what
the
best
new
books
were
or
if
such
and
such
a
book
was
all
that
it
was
cracked
up
to
be
if
the
instructor
had
read
the
book
he
was
treated
to
a
look
of
contempt
that
sent
him
hastening
to
the
library
of
course
not
all
of
the
undergraduates
took
to
reading
and
thinking
the
millennium
had
not
arrived
but
the
intelligent
majority
began
to
read
and
discuss
books
openly
and
the
intelligent
majority
ruled
the
campus
hugh
was
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
of
the
readers
he
was
taking
a
course
in
poetry
with
blake
the
head
of
the
english
department
his
other
instructors
either
bored
him
or
left
him
cold
but
blake
turned
each
class
hour
into
a
thrilling
experience
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
gray
hair
dark
eyes
and
a
magnificent
voice
he
taught
poetry
almost
entirely
by
reading
it
only
occasionally
interpolating
an
explanatory
remark
and
he
read
beautifully
his
reading
was
dramatic
almost
tricky
but
it
made
the
poems
live
for
his
students
and
they
reveled
in
his
classes
hugh
junior
year
was
made
almost
beautiful
by
that
poetry
course
and
by
his
adoration
for
cynthia
he
was
writing
verses
constantly
and
he
found
cynthia
an
exceedingly
troublesome
word
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
would
rime
with
it
at
times
he
thought
of
taking
to
free
verse
but
the
results
of
his
efforts
did
not
satisfy
him
he
always
had
the
feeling
that
he
had
merely
chopped
up
some
rather
bad
prose
and
he
was
invariably
right
cynthia
wrote
him
that
she
loved
the
poems
he
sent
her
because
they
were
so
passionate
he
blushed
when
he
read
her
praise
it
disturbed
him
he
wished
that
she
had
used
a
different
word
chapter
xxi
for
the
first
term
hugh
slid
comfortably
down
a
well
oiled
groove
of
routine
he
went
to
the
movies
regularly
wrote
as
regularly
to
cynthia
and
thought
about
her
even
more
read
enormous
quantities
of
poetry
bulled
with
his
friends
attended
all
the
athletic
contests
played
cards
occasionally
and
received
his
daily
liquor
from
vinton
he
no
longer
protested
when
vinton
offered
him
a
drink
he
accepted
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
he
had
almost
completely
forgotten
that
smoking
was
good
for
a
runner
he
had
just
about
decided
that
he
was
a
runner
anyway
one
evening
in
early
spring
he
met
george
winsor
as
he
was
crossing
the
campus
hello
george
where
are
you
going
over
to
ted

winsor

i

little

hugh
i

very
often
though
except
in
the
house
when
the
fellows
insist
i
ca

craps
at
all
and
i
get
tired
of
cards
after
a
couple
of
hours
i
a
damn
fool
to
play
winsor
asserted
positively
a
plain
damn
fool
i
ought
to
waste
my
time
at
it
but
i
a
regular
fiend
for
the
game
i
get
a
great
kick
out
of
it
how
to
sit
in
with
us
only
going
to
be
half
a
dozen
fellows

yeah
it
start
with
a
limit
but
after
an
hour
deuces
be
wild
all
over
the
place
and
the
sky
will
be
the
limit
i
sat
in
those
games
before
winsor
laughed
guess
you
right
but
what
the
odds

shoot
a
few
hands
well
but
i
ca
stay
later
than
eleven
i

i
got
to
bone
up
on
it
some
time
i
got
that
quiz
too
i
leave
with
you
at
eleven
winsor
and
hugh
entered
the
dormitory
and
climbed
the
stairs
door
was
open
and
several
undergraduates
were
lolling
around
the
room
smoking
and
chatting
they
welcomed
the
with
shouts
of
hi
hugh
and
hi
george
allen
had
a
large
round
table
in
the
center
of
his
study
and
the
boys
soon
had
it
cleared
for
action
allen
tossed
the
cards
upon
the
table
produced
several
and
then
carefully
locked
the
door
keep
an
ear
open
for
mac
he
admonished
his
friends
he
warned
me
twice
now
mac
was
the
and
he
had
a
way
of
dropping
in
unexpectedly
on
gambling
parties
here
are
the
chips
you
count
out
george
limit
the
boys
drew
up
chairs
to
the
table
lighted
cigarettes
or
pipes
and
began
the
game
hugh
had
been
right
the
limit
was
soon
lifted
and
allen
urged
his
guests
to
go
as
far
as
they
liked
there
were
ugly
rumors
about
allen
around
the
campus
he
was
good
looking
belonged
to
a
fraternity
in
high
standing
wore
excellent
clothes
and
did
fairly
well
in
his
studies
but
the
rumors
persisted
there
were
students
who
insisted
that
he
had
the
conscience
of
a
snake
and
a
good
many
of
them
hinted
that
no
honest
man
ever
had
such
consistently
good
luck
at
cards
and
dice
the
other
boys
soon
got
heated
and
talkative
but
allen
said
little
besides
announcing
his
bids
his
blue
eyes
remained
coldly
expressionless
whether
he
won
or
lost
the
hand
his
crisp
curly
brown
hair
remained
neatly
combed
and
untouched
by
a
nervous
hand
his
lips
parted
occasionally
in
a
quiet
smile
he
was
the
perfect
gambler
never
excited
always
in
absolute
control
of
himself
hugh
marveled
at
the
control
as
the
evening
wore
on
he
was
excited
and
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
keep
his
excitement
from
showing
luck
however
was
with
him
by
ten
he
was
dollars
ahead
and
most
of
it
was
allen
money
hugh
passed
by
three
hands
in
succession
unwilling
to
take
any
chances
he
had
decided
to
play
close
never
betting
unless
he
held
something
worth
putting
his
money
on
allen
dealt
the
fourth
hand
ante
up
he
said
quietly
the
five
other
men
followed
his
lead
in
tossing
chips
into
the
center
of
the
table
he
looked
at
his
hand
two
blue
ones
if
you
want
to
stay
in
winsor
and
two
of
the
men
threw
down
their
cards
but
hugh
and
a
lad
named
mandel
each
shoved
two
blue
chips
into
the
pot
hugh
had
three
queens
and
an
ace
one
card
he
said
to
allen
allen
tossed
him
the
card
and
hugh
heart
leaped
when
he
saw
that
it
was
an
ace
two
cards
ted
mandel
requested
nervously
crushing
his
cigarette
in
an
he
picked
up
the
cards
one
at
a
time
lifting
each
slowly
by
one
corner
and
peeking
at
it
as
if
he
were
afraid
that
a
sudden
full
view
would
blast
him
to
eternity
his
face
did
not
change
expression
as
he
added
the
cards
to
the
three
that
he
held
in
his
hand
i
sitting
pretty
allen
remarked
casually
picking
up
the
five
cards
that
he
had
laid
down
before
he
dealt
the
betting
began
hugh
nervous
openly
excited
mandel
stonily
calm
allen
completely
at
ease
at
first
the
bets
were
for
a
dollar
but
they
gradually
rose
to
five
mandel
threw
down
his
cards
fight
it
out
he
said
morosely
i
thrown
away
bucks
and
i
be
damned
if
i
going
to
throw
away
any
more
to
see
your
allen
lifted
a
pile
of
chips
and
let
them
fall
lightly
clicking
a
rapid
staccato
it
cost
you
ten
dollars
to
see
my
hand
hugh
he
said
quietly
it
cost
you
twenty
if
you
want
to
see
mine
hugh
responded
tossing
the
equivalent
to
thirty
dollars
into
the
pot
he
watched
allen
eagerly
but
allen
face
remained
quite
impassive
as
he
raised
hugh
another
ten
the
four
boys
who
were
playing
leaned
forward
pipes
or
cigarettes
in
their
mouths
their
stomachs
pressed
against
the
table
their
eyes
narrowed
and
excited
the
air
was
a
stench
of
stale
smoke
the
silence
between
bets
was
electric
the
betting
continued
hugh
sure
that
allen
was
bluffing
but
allen
never
failed
to
raise
him
ten
dollars
on
every
bet
finally
hugh
had
a
hundred
dollars
in
the
pot
and
dared
not
risk
more
on
his
hand
i
think
you
bluffing
goddamn
it
he
said
his
voice
shrill
and
nervous
i
call
you
show
your
stinkin
hand
oh
not
so
stinkin
allen
replied
lightly
i
got
four
of
a
kind
all
of
kings
let
see
your
three
deuces
he
tossed
down
his
hand
and
hugh
slumped
in
his
chair
at
the
sight
of
the
four
kings
he
shoved
the
pile
of
chips
toward
allen
take
the
pot
damn
you
of
all
the
bastard
luck
look
he
slapped
down
his
cards
angrily
a
full
house
queens
up
christ
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
obscenity
the
other
boys
listening
sympathetically
all
except
allen
who
was
carefully
stacking
the
chips
in
a
few
minutes
hugh
anger
died
he
remembered
that
he
was
only
about
dollars
behind
and
that
he
had
an
hour
in
which
to
recover
them
his
face
became
set
and
hard
his
hands
lost
their
jerky
eagerness
he
played
carefully
never
daring
to
enter
a
big
pot
never
betting
for
more
than
his
hands
were
worth
as
the
bets
grew
larger
the
room
grew
quieter
every
one
was
smoking
constantly
the
air
was
heavy
with
smoke
and
the
stench
grew
more
and
more
foul
outside
of
a
soft
i
raise
you
twenty
or
even
fifty
bucks
if
you
want
to
see
my
hand
a
muttered
oath
or
a
request
to
buy
chips
there
was
hardly
a
word
said
the
excitement
was
so
intense
that
it
hurt
the
expletives
smelled
of
the
docks
at
times
there
was
more
than
five
hundred
dollars
in
a
pot
and
five
times
out
of
seven
when
the
pot
was
big
allen
won
it
win
or
lose
he
continued
cool
and
calm
at
times
smoking
a
pipe
other
times
puffing
nonchalantly
at
a
cigarette
the
acrid
smoke
cut
hugh
eyes
they
smarted
and
pained
but
he
continued
to
light
cigarette
after
cigarette
drawing
the
smoke
deep
into
his
lungs
hardly
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
hurt
he
won
and
lost
won
and
lost
but
gradually
he
won
back
the
dollars
and
a
little
more
the
college
clock
struck
eleven
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
go
but
he
wondered
if
he
could
quit
with
honor
when
he
was
ahead
i
ought
to
go
he
said
hesitatingly
i
told
george
when
i
said
that
i
sit
in
that
i
have

one
of
the
men

excitedly

warm
i
know
hugh
agreed
and
i
hate
like
hell

but
i

to
beat
it
besides
the
stakes
are
too
big
for
me
i
ca
afford
a
game
like
this
you
can
afford
it
as
well
as
i
can
mandel
said
irritably
i
over
two
hundred
berries
in
the
hole

goddamn
well

winsor
announced
miserably
but
i
got
to

that
eccy
i
going
to
be
out
of
luck
he
shoved
back
his
chair
i
hate
like
hell
to
leave
but
i
promised
hugh
that
i
leave
with
him
at
eleven
and
i
got
to
do
it
allen
had
been
quite
indifferent
when
hugh
said
that
he
was
leaving
hugh
was
obviously
small
money
and
allen
had
no
time
to
waste
on
but
winsor
was
a
different
matter
you
do
want
to
go
george
when
you
in
the
hole
better
stick
around
maybe
you
win
it
back
your
luck
ca
be
bad
all
night
you
right
said
winsor
stretching
mightily
it
ca
be
bad
all
night
but
i
ca
hang
around
all
night
to
watch
it
change
welcome
to
the
hundred
and
fifty
ted
but
some
night
soon
i
coming
over
and
take
it
away
from
you
allen
laughed
any
time
you
say
george
hugh
and
winsor
settled
their
accounts
then
stood
up
aching
and
weary
their
muscles
cramped
from
three
hours
of
sitting
and
nervous
tension
they
said
brief
good
nights
unlocked
the
door
they
heard
allen
lock
it
behind
them
and
left
their
disgruntled
friends
glad
to
be
out
of
the
noisome
odor
of
the
room
god
what
luck
winsor
exclaimed
as
they
started
down
the
hall
off
allen
for
good
that
boy
wins
big
pots
too
regularly
and
always
loses
the
little
ones
i
bet
he
a
artist
or
something
he
something
all
right
hugh
agreed
cripes
i
feel
dirty
and
stinko
i
feel
as
if
i
been
in
a
den
you
have
been
say
what
that
they
had
almost
traversed
the
length
of
the
long
hall
when
winsor
stopped
suddenly
taking
hugh
by
the
arm
a
door
was
open
and
they
could
hear
somebody
reading
what
what
hugh
asked
a
little
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
winsor
question
listen
that
poem
i
heard
it
somewhere
before
what
is
it
hugh
listened
a
moment
and
then
said
oh
that
the
poem
prof
blake
read
us
the
other
day
you
know
it
about
the
shepherd
and
it
great
stuff
listen
they
remained
standing
in
the
deserted
hall
the
voice
coming
clearly
to
them
through
the
open
doorway
it
freddy
fowler
winsor
whispered
he
can
sure
read
the
reading
stopped
and
they
heard
fowler
say
to
some
one
presumably
his
this
is
the
part
that
i
like
best
get
it
then
he
read
plea
to
such
argument
what
can
i
plead
or
what
pale
promise
make
yet
since
it
is
in
women
to
pity
rather
than
to
aspire
a
little
i
will
speak
i
love
thee
then
not
only
for
thy
body
packed
with
sweet
of
all
this
world
that
cup
of
brimming
june
that
jar
of
violet
wine
set
in
the
air
that
palest
rose
sweet
in
the
night
of
life
nor
for
that
stirring
bosom
all
besieged
by
drowsing
lovers
or
thy
perilous
hair
nor
for
that
face
that
might
indeed
provoke
invasion
of
old
cities
no
nor
all
thy
freshness
stealing
on
me
like
strange
sleep
winsor
hand
tightened
on
hugh
arm
and
the
two
boys
stood
almost
rigid
listening
to
the
young
voice
which
was
trembling
with
emotion
rich
with
passion
only
for
this
do
i
love
thee
but
because
infinity
upon
thee
broods
and
thou
are
full
of
whispers
and
of
shadows
thou
meanest
what
the
sea
has
striven
to
say
so
long
and
yearned
up
the
cliffs
to
tell
thou
art
what
all
the
winds
have
uttered
not
what
the
still
night
suggesteth
to
the
heart
thy
voice
is
like
to
music
heard
ere
birth
some
spirit
lute
touched
on
a
spirit
sea
thy
face
remembered
is
from
other
worlds
it
has
been
died
for
though
i
know
not
when
it
has
been
sung
of
though
i
know
not
where
god
winsor
whispered
that
beautiful
hush
this
is
the
best
part
has
the
strangeness
of
the
luring
west
and
of
sad
beside
thee
i
am
aware
of
other
times
and
lands
of
birth
far
back
of
lives
in
many
stars
o
beauty
lone
and
like
a
candle
clear
in
this
dark
country
of
the
world
thou
art
my
woe
my
early
light
my
music
dying
hugh
and
winsor
remained
silent
while
the
young
voice
went
on
reading
reply
her
gentle
refusal
of
the
god
and
her
proud
acceptance
of
the
mortal
finally
they
heard
the
last
words
when
she
had
spoken
idas
with
one
cry
held
her
and
there
was
silence
while
the
god
in
anger
disappeared
then
slowly
they
he
looking
downward
and
she
gazing
up
into
the
evening
green
wandered
away
when
the
voice
paused
the
poem
done
the
two
boys
walked
slowly
down
the
hall
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
cool
night
air
neither
said
a
word
until
they
were
across
the
campus
then
winsor
spoke
softly
god
was
that
beautiful
yes
beautiful
hugh
voice
was
hardly
more
than
a
whisper
beautiful
it
it
oh
it
makes
me
kinda
ashamed
me
too
poker
when
we
can
have
that
we
awful
fools
hugh
yes
awful
fools
chapter
xxii
prom
came
early
in
may
and
hugh
looked
forward
to
it
joyously
partly
because
it
would
be
his
first
prom
and
partly
because
cynthia
was
coming
cynthia
he
thought
of
her
constantly
dreamed
of
her
wrote
poems
about
her
and
to
her
at
times
his
longing
for
her
swelled
into
an
ecstasy
of
desire
that
racked
and
tore
him
he
was
lost
in
love
his
moods
sweeping
him
from
lyric
happiness
to
black
despair
he
wrote
to
her
several
times
a
week
and
between
letters
he
took
long
walks
composing
dithyrambic
epistles
that
fortunately
were
never
written
when
he
received
her
letter
saying
that
she
would
come
to
prom
he
yelled
like
a
lunatic
pounded
the
astonished
vinton
on
the
back
and
raced
to
the
she
coming
he
shouted
there
were
several
men
in
the
room
and
they
all
turned
and
looked
at
him
some
of
them
grinning
broadly
what
th
hell
hugh
leonard
gates
asked
amiably
who
coming
she
hugh
blushed
and
shuffled
his
feet
he
knew
that
he
had
laid
himself
open
to
a
royal
razzing
but
he
proceeded
to
bluff
himself
out
of
the
dilemma
she
oh
yes
she
well
she
is
she
altogether
divine
len
he
was
trying
hard
to
be
casual
and
flippant
but
his
eyes
were
dancing
and
his
lips
trembled
with
smiles
gates
grinned
at
him
a
poor
bluff
old
man
a
darn
poor
bluff
in
love
and
i
afraid
that
you
in
a
very
bad
way
come
on
tell
us
the
lady
name
her
pedigree
and
list
of
charms
hugh
grinned
back
at
gates
chase
yourself
he
said
gaily
i
tell
you
a
blamed
thing
about
her
you
better
said
jim
saunders
from
the
depths
of
a
leather
chair
is
she
the
jane
whose
picture
adorns
your
desk
yeah
hugh
admitted
how
do
you
like
her
very
fair
very
fair
saunders
was
magnificently
lofty
i
seen
better
of
course
but
i
seen
worse
too
not
bad
um
not
very
bad
the
razzing
had
started
and
hugh
lost
his
nerve
jim
you
can
go
to
hell
he
said
definitely
prepared
to
rush
before
saunders
could
reply
you
do
know
a
queen
when
you
see
one
why
cynthia
cynthia
four
of
the
boys
shouted
so
her
name
cynthia
that
but
hugh
was
embarrassed
and
delighted
the
girls
arrived
on
thursday
the
train
which
brought
most
of
them
reaching
haydensville
early
in
the
afternoon
hugh
paced
up
and
down
the
station
trying
to
keep
up
a
pretense
of
a
conversation
with
two
or
three
others
he
gave
the
wrong
reply
twice
and
then
decided
to
say
nothing
more
he
listened
with
his
whole
body
for
the
first
whistle
of
the
train
and
so
great
was
the
chatter
of
the
hundreds
of
waiting
youths
that
he
never
heard
it
suddenly
the
engine
rounded
a
curve
and
a
minute
later
the
train
stopped
before
the
station
immediately
the
boys
began
to
mill
around
the
platform
like
cattle
about
to
stampede
standing
on
their
toes
to
look
over
the
heads
of
their
comrades
shoving
shouting
dancing
in
their
impatience
girls
began
to
descend
the
steps
of
the
cars
the
stampede
broke
a
youth
would
see
his
girl
and
start
through
the
crowd
for
her
dozens
spotted
their
girls
at
the
same
time
and
tried
to
run
through
the
crowd
they
bumped
into
one
another
laughed
joyously
bumped
into
somebody
else
and
finally
reached
the
girl
when
hugh
eventually
saw
cynthia
standing
on
a
car
platform
near
him
he
shouted
to
her
and
held
his
hand
high
in
greeting
she
saw
him
and
waved
back
at
the
same
time
starting
down
the
steps
she
had
a
little
scarlet
hat
pulled
down
over
her
curly
brown
hair
and
she
wore
a
simple
blue
that
set
off
her
slender
figure
perfectly
her
eyes
seemed
bigger
and
browner
than
ever
her
nose
more
impudently
tilted
her
mouth
more
supremely
irresistible
her
cheeks
were
daintily
rouged
her
eyebrows
plucked
into
a
thin
arch
she
was
new
york
from
her
small
pumps
to
the
expensively
simple
scarlet
hat
hugh
dashed
several
people
aside
and
grabbed
her
hand
squeezing
it
unmercifully
oh
gee
cynthia
i
glad
to
see
you
i
thought
the
darn
train
was
never
going
to
get
here
how
are
you
gee
you
looking
great
wonderful
where
your
he
fairly
stuttered
in
his
excitement
his
words
toppling
over
each
other
i
full
of
pep
you
look
wonderful
there
my
the
big
black
one

the
porter

bits
or
something

any
change
hugh
tipped
the
porter
picked
up
the
with
one
hand
and
took
cynthia
by
the
arm
with
the
other
carefully
piloting
her
through
the
noisy
surging
crowd
of
boys
and
girls
all
of
them
talking
at
top
speed
and
in
high
excited
voices
once
hugh
and
cynthia
were
off
the
platform
they
could
talk
without
shouting
we
got
to
walk
up
the
hill
hugh
explained
miserably
i
get
a
car
for
love
nor
money
i
awfully
sorry
cynthia
did
a
and
petted
his
arm
happily
what
do

so

or

hugh

on
blushing

ahead
he
said
bravely
i
wish

cynthia
laughed
like
fun
you
do
you
die
of
embarrassment
but
your
mouth
is
an
awful
temptation

have
the
sweetest
mouth
hugh

she
continued
to
banter
him
until
they
reached
the
fraternity
house
where
do
i
live
she
demanded
in
your
room
i
hope
yep

down
in
keller
hall
with
norry
parker
his
sick
in
the
hospital
so

to
see

pounds
of
dirt
washed
off
and
some
powder
on
my
nose
well
we
having
a
here
at
the
house
at
but
we
got
an
hour
till
then
and
i
thought
we
take
a
walk
i
want
to
show
you
the
college
after
cynthia
had
repaired
the
damages
of
travel
and
had
been
introduced
to
hugh
fraternity
brothers
and
their
girls
she
and
hugh
departed
for
a
tour
of
the
campus
the
lawns
were
so
green
that
the
grass
seemed
to
be
bursting
with
color
the
elms
waved
tiny
new
leaves
in
a
faint
breeze
the
walls
of
the
buildings
were
speckled
with
green
patches
of
ivy
cynthia
was
properly
awed
by
the
chapel
and
enthusiastic
over
the
other
buildings
she
assured
hugh
that
sanford
men
looked
awfully
smooth
in
their
knickers
and
white
flannels
in
fact
she
said
the
whole
college
seemed
jake
to
her
they
wandered
past
the
lake
and
into
the
woods
as
if
by
common
consent
once
they
were
out
of
sight
of
hugh
paused
and
turned
to
cynthia
without
a
word
she
stepped
into
his
arms
and
lifted
her
face
to
his
hugh
heart
seemed
to
stop
he
was
so
hungry
for
that
kiss
he
had
waited
so
long
for
it
when
he
finally
took
his
lips
from
hers
cynthia
whispered
softly
you
such
a
good
egg
hugh
honey
such
a
damn
good
egg
hugh
could
say
nothing
he
just
held
her
close
his
mind
swimming
dizzily
his
whole
being
atingle
for
a
long
time
he
held
her
kissing
her
now
tenderly
now
almost
brutally
lost
in
a
thrill
of
passion
finally
she
whispered
faintly
no
more
hugh
not
now
dear
hugh
released
her
reluctantly
i
love
you
so
damned
hard
cynthia
he
said
huskily
i
i
ca
keep
my
hands
off
of
you
i
know
she
replied
but
we
got
to
go
back
wait
a
minute
though
i
must
look
like
the
devil
she
straightened
her
hat
powdered
her
nose
and
then
tucked
her
arm
in
his
after
the
and
dinner
hugh
left
her
to
dress
for
the
dramatic
society
musical
comedy
that
was
to
be
performed
that
evening
he
returned
to
norry
parker
room
and
prepared
to
put
on
his
tuxedo
you
look
as
if
somebody
had
left
you
a
million
dollars
norry
said
to
hugh
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
anybody
look
so
happy
you
you
shine
hugh
laughed
i
am
happy
norry
happy
as
hell
i
so
happy
i
ache
oh
god
cynthia
wonderful
i
crazy
about
her
norry
plumb
crazy
norry
had
known
cynthia
for
years
and
despite
his
ingenuousness
he
had
noticed
some
of
her
characteristics
i
never
expected
you
to
fall
in
love
with
cynthia
hugh
he
said
in
his
gentle
way
i
awfully
surprised
hugh
was
humming
a
strain
from
say
it
with
music
while
he
undressed
he
pulled
off
his
trousers
and
then
turned
to
norry
who
was
sitting
on
the
bed
what
did
you
say
you
said
something
did
you
norry
smiled
for
some
quite
inexplicable
reason
he
suddenly
felt
older
than
hugh
yes
i
said
something
i
said
that
i
never
expected
you
to
fall
in
love
with
cynthia
hugh
paused
in
taking
off
his
socks
why
not
he
demanded
wonderful
you
so
different
how
different
we
understand
each
other
perfectly
of
course
we
only
saw
each
other
for
a
week
when
i
was
down
at
your
place
but
we
understood
each
other
from
the
first
i
was
crazy
about
her
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
norry
was
troubled
i
do
think
i
can
explain
exactly
he
said
slowly
cynthia
runs
with
a
fast
crowd
and
she
smokes
and
drinks
and
you
well
you
idealistic
hugh
pulled
off
his
underclothes
and
laughed
as
he
stuck
his
feet
into
slippers
and
drew
on
a
of
course
she
does
all
the
girls
do
now
she
just
as
idealistic
as
i
am
he
wrapped
the
around
him
and
departed
for
the
showers
singing
gaily
say
it
with
music
beautiful
music
somehow
they
rather
be
kissed
to
the
strains
of
chopin
or
liszt
a
melody
mellow
played
on
a
cello
helps
mister
cupid
along
so
say
it
with
a
beautiful
song
shortly
he
returned
still
singing
the
same
song
his
voice
full
and
happy
he
continued
to
sing
as
he
dressed
paying
no
attention
to
norry
completely
lost
in
his
own
elysian
thoughts
to
hugh
and
cynthia
the
musical
comedy
was
a
complete
success
although
the
music
written
by
an
undergraduate
was
strangely
reminiscent
of
several
recent
broadway
song
successes
and
the
plot
of
the
comedy
got
lost
after
the
first
ten
minutes
and
was
never
recovered
until
the
last
two
it
was
amusing
to
watch
men
try
to
act
like
women
and
two
of
the
ladies
of
the
chorus
were
patently
drunk
the
leading
lady
was
a
wrestler
and
looked
it
his
biceps
swelling
magnificently
every
time
he
raised
his
arms
to
embrace
the
comic
it
was
glorious
nonsense
badly
enough
done
to
be
really
funny
hugh
and
cynthia
along
with
the
rest
of
the
audience
laughed
joyously
and
held
hands
after
the
play
was
over
they
returned
to
the
nu
delta
house
and
danced
until
two
in
the
morning
during
one
dance
cynthia
whispered
to
him
hugh
get
me
a
drink
or
i
pass
out
hugh
forgetting
his
indignation
of
the
year
before
went
in
search
of
vinton
and
deprived
that
young
man
of
a
pint
of
gin
without
a
scruple
he
and
cynthia
then
sneaked
behind
the
house
and
did
away
with
the
liquor
other
couples
were
drinking
all
of
them
surreptitiously
leonard
gates
having
laid
down
the
law
in
no
uncertain
manner
and
all
of
the
brothers
were
a
little
afraid
of
gates
cynthia
slept
until
noon
the
next
day
and
hugh
went
to
his
classes
in
the
afternoon
they
attended
a
baseball
game
and
then
returned
to
the
fraternity
house
for
another
the
prom
was
to
be
that
night
hugh
assured
cynthia
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
wet
party
and
that
vinton
had
sold
him
a
good
supply
of
scotch
the
campus
was
rife
with
stories
this
was
the
wettest
prom
on
record
the
girls
were
drinking
as
much
as
the
men
some
of
the
fraternities
had
made
the
sky
the
limit
the
dormitories
were
being
invaded
by
couples
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
and
so
on
hugh
heard
numerous
stories
but
paid
no
attention
to
them
he
was
supremely
happy
and
that
was
all
that
mattered
true
several
men
had
advised
him
to
bring
plenty
of
liquor
along
to
the
prom
if
he
wanted
to
have
a
good
time
and
he
was
careful
to
act
on
their
advice
especially
as
cynthia
had
assured
him
that
she
would
dance
until
doomsday
if
he
kept
her
well
oiled
with
hooch
the
gymnasium
was
gaily
decorated
for
the
prom
the
walls
hidden
with
greenery
the
rafters
twined
with
the
college
colors
and
almost
lost
behind
hundreds
of
small
japanese
lanterns
the
fraternity
booths
were
made
of
fir
boughs
and
the
orchestra
platform
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
looked
like
a
small
forest
of
saplings
the
girls
were
beautiful
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
lanterns
their
arms
and
shoulders
smooth
and
white
the
men
were
trim
and
neat
in
their
tuxedos
the
dark
suits
emphasizing
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
gowns
it
was
soon
apparent
that
some
of
the
couples
had
got
at
least
half
oiled
before
the
dance
began
and
before
an
hour
had
passed
many
more
couples
gave
evidence
of
imbibing
more
freely
than
wisely
occasionally
a
hysterical
laugh
burst
shrilly
above
the
pounding
of
the
drums
and
the
moaning
of
the
saxophones
a
couple
would
stagger
awkwardly
against
another
couple
and
then
continue
unevenly
on
an
uncertain
way
the
stags
seemed
to
be
the
worst
offenders
many
of
them
were
joyously
drunk
dashing
dizzily
across
the
floor
to
find
a
partner
and
once
having
taken
her
from
a
friend
dragging
her
about
happily
unconscious
of
anything
but
the
girl
and
the
insistent
rhythm
of
the
music
the
musicians
played
as
if
in
a
frenzy
the
drums
a
terrible
the
saxophones
moaning
and
wailing
the
violins
singing
sensuously
shrilly
as
if
in
pain
an
exquisite
searing
pain
boom
boom
boom
boom
stumbling
all
around
stumbling
all
around
stumbling
all
around
so
funny
the
couples
moved
slowly
about
the
gymnasium
body
pressed
tight
to
body
swaying
in
place
boom
boom
boom
boom
stumbling
here
and
there
stumbling
everywhere
six
dowagers
the
chaperons
sat
in
a
corner
gossiped
and
idly
watched
the
young
couples
a
man
suddenly
released
his
girl
and
raced
clumsily
for
the
door
one
hand
pressed
to
his
mouth
the
other
stretched
uncertainly
in
front
of
him
always
the
drums
beating
their
terrible
their
primitive
boom
boom
boom
boom
i
like
it
just
a
little
bit
just
a
little
bit
quite
a
little
bit
the
music
ceased
and
some
of
the
couples
disentangled
themselves
others
waited
in
frank
embrace
for
the
orchestra
to
begin
the
encore
a
boy
slumped
in
a
chair
his
head
in
his
hands
his
partner
sought
two
friends
they
helped
the
boy
out
of
the
gymnasium
the
orchestra
leader
lifted
his
bow
the
stags
waited
in
a
broken
line
looking
for
certain
girls
the
music
began
turning
a
song
with
comic
words
into
something
weirdly
sensuous
strange
syncopations
uneven
startling
a
mad
the
couples
pressed
close
together
again
swaying
barely
moving
in
place
boom
boom
boom
boom
hats
clothes
that
why
they
call
me
rose
the
saxophones
sang
the
melody
with
passionate
despair
the
violins
played
tricks
with
a
broken
heart
the
clarinets
rose
shrill
in
pain
the
drums
beat
on
boom
boom
boom
boom
a
boy
and
girl
sought
a
dark
corner
he
shielded
her
with
his
body
while
she
took
a
drink
from
a
flask
then
he
turned
his
face
to
the
corner
and
drank
a
moment
later
they
were
back
on
the
floor
holding
each
other
tight
drunkenly
swaying
finally
the
last
strains
a
wall
of
agony
one
knows
that
i
just
rose
from
the
couples
moved
slowly
off
the
floor
the
pounding
of
the
drums
still
in
their
ears
and
in
their
blood
some
of
them
sought
the
fraternity
booths
some
of
the
girls
retired
to
their
perhaps
to
have
another
drink
many
of
the
men
went
outside
for
a
smoke
and
to
tip
a
flask
upward
through
the
noise
the
the
dancers
moved
men
and
women
quite
sober
the
men
vainly
trying
to
shield
the
women
from
contact
with
any
one
who
was
drunk
there
was
an
angry
light
in
those
men
eyes
but
most
of
them
said
nothing
merely
kept
close
to
their
partners
ready
to
defend
them
from
any
too
assertive
friend
again
the
music
again
the
of
the
drums
on
and
on
for
hours
a
man
passed
out
cold
and
had
to
be
carried
from
the
gymnasium
a
girl
got
a
laughing
jag
and
shrieked
with
idiotic
laughter
until
her
partner
managed
to
lead
her
protesting
off
the
floor
on
and
on
the
constant
rhythmic
wailing
of
the
fiddles
syncopated
passion
screaming
with
lust
the
drums
horribly
primitive
drunken
embraces
oh
those
wabash
blues
i
know
i
got
my
dues
a
soul
am
i
i
feel
that
i
could
die
blues
sobbing
despairing
blues
orgiastic
music
beautiful
hideous
light
that
gleams
haunts
me
in
my
dreams
the
drums
boom
boom
boom
booming
i
pack
my
walking
shoes
to
lose
those
blues
hour
after
hour
on
and
on
flushed
faces
breaths
hot
with
passion
and
whisky
pretty
girls
cool
and
sober
dancing
with
men
who
held
them
with
drunken
lasciviousness
sober
men
hating
the
whisky
breaths
of
the
girls
on
and
on
the
drunken
carnival
to
maddening
music
the
passion
the
lust
both
hugh
and
cynthia
were
drinking
and
by
midnight
both
of
them
were
drunk
too
drunk
any
longer
to
think
clearly
as
they
danced
hugh
was
aware
of
nothing
but
cynthia
body
her
firm
young
body
close
to
his
his
blood
beat
with
the
pounding
of
the
drums
he
held
her
tighter
and
tighter
the
gymnasium
the
other
couples
a
swaying
mist
before
his
eyes
when
the
dance
ended
cynthia
whispered
huskily
me
somewhere
hugh
strangely
enough
he
got
the
significance
of
her
words
at
once
his
blood
raced
and
he
staggered
so
crazily
that
cynthia
had
to
hold
him
by
the
arm
sure
sure
i
i
you
i
i
too
cyntheea
they
walked
unevenly
out
of
the
gymnasium
down
the
steps
and
through
the
crowd
of
smokers
standing
outside
hardly
aware
of
what
he
was
doing
hugh
led
cynthia
to
keller
hall
which
was
not
more
than
fifty
yards
distant
he
took
a
flask
out
of
his
pocket
jush
one
more
drink
he
said
thickly
and
emptied
the
bottle
then
holding
cynthia
desperately
by
the
arm
he
opened
the
door
of
keller
hall
and
stumbled
with
her
up
the
stairs
to
norry
parker
room
fortunately
the
hallways
were
deserted
and
no
one
saw
them
the
door
was
unlocked
and
hugh
after
searching
blindly
for
the
switch
finally
clicked
on
the
lights
and
mechanically
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
was
very
dizzy
he
wanted
another
drink
and
he
wanted
cynthia
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
pulled
her
drunkenly
to
him
the
door
of
one
of
the
bedrooms
opened
and
norry
parker
stood
watching
them
he
had
spent
the
evening
at
the
home
of
a
musical
professor
and
had
returned
to
his
room
only
a
few
minutes
before
his
face
went
white
when
he
saw
the
embracing
couple
hugh
he
said
sharply
hugh
and
cynthia
still
clinging
to
each
other
looked
at
him
slowly
cynthia
took
her
arms
from
around
hugh
neck
and
forced
herself
from
his
embrace
norry
disappeared
into
his
room
and
came
out
a
minute
later
with
his
coat
on
he
had
just
begun
to
undress
when
he
had
heard
a
noise
in
the
study
i
see
you
home
cynthia
he
said
quietly
he
took
her
arm
and
led
her
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
hugh
stared
at
them
blankly
swaying
slightly
completely
befuddled
cynthia
went
with
norry
willingly
enough
leaning
heavily
on
his
arm
and
occasionally
sniffing
when
he
returned
to
his
room
hugh
was
sitting
on
the
floor
staring
at
a
photograph
of
norry
mother
he
had
been
staring
at
it
for
ten
minutes
holding
it
first
at
arm
length
and
then
drawing
it
closer
and
closer
to
him
no
matter
where
he
held
it
he
could
not
see
what
it
was
and
he
was
determined
to
see
it
norry
walked
up
to
him
and
reached
for
the
photograph
give
me
that
he
said
curtly
take
your
hands
on
my
picture
it
not
hugh
exclaimed
angrily
it
not
it
my
musher
my
own
my
my
own
dear
musher
oh
oh
he
slumped
down
in
a
heap
and
began
to
sob
bitterly
muttering
musher
musher
musher
norry
was
angry
the
whole
scene
was
revolting
to
him
his
best
friend
was
a
disgusting
sight
apparently
not
much
better
than
a
gibbering
idiot
and
hugh
had
shamefully
abused
his
hospitality
norry
was
no
longer
gentle
and
boyish
he
was
bitterly
disillusioned
get
up
he
said
briefly
get
up
and
go
to
bed
tha
my
musher
you
said
it
was
my
my
musher
hugh
looked
up
his
face
wet
with
maudlin
tears
norry
leaned
over
and
snatched
the
picture
from
him
take
your
dirty
hands
off
of
that
he
snapped
get
up
and
go
to
bed
tha
my
musher
hugh
was
gently
persistent
it
not
your
mother
you
make
me
sick
go
to
bed
norry
tugged
at
hugh
arm
impotently
hugh
simply
sat
limp
a
dead
weight
norry
gray
eyes
narrowed
he
took
a
glass
filled
it
with
cold
water
in
the
bedroom
and
then
deliberately
dashed
the
water
into
hugh
face
then
he
repeated
the
performance
hugh
shook
his
head
and
rubbed
his
hands
wonderingly
over
his
face
no
good
he
said
almost
clearly
i
no
good
you
certainly
are
come
on
get
up
and
go
to
bed
again
norry
tugged
at
his
arm
and
this
time
hugh
clinging
clumsily
to
the
edge
of
the
table
by
which
he
was
sitting
staggered
to
his
feet
i
a
blot
he
declared
mournfully
i
no
good
norry
i
an
an
excreeshence
an
tha
what
i
am
something
of
the
sort
norry
agreed
in
disgust
here
let
me
take
off
your
coat

my
coat
alone
he
pulled
himself
away
from
norry
i
no

he
clung
pleadingly
to
norry
arm
and
begged
with
passionate
intensity
you

over
to
harry
king
room
he
got
a
a
pistol
you
get
it
for
me
and
i
put

he
touched
his
temple
awkwardly
and
i
i

i
an
norry
shook
him
shut

you

i
sick
i
an
the
room
was
whizzing
rapidly
around
hugh
and
he
clung
hysterically
to
norry
finally
he
permitted
himself
to
be
led
into
the
bedroom
and
undressed
still
moaning
that
he
was
an
the
bed
pitched
he
lay
on
his
right
side
clutching
the
covers
in
terror
he
turned
over
on
his
back
still
the
bed
swung
up
and
down
sickeningly
then
he
twisted
over
to
his
left
side
and
the
bed
suddenly
swung
into
rest
almost
stable
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
sound
asleep
he
cut
chapel
and
his
two
classes
the
next
morning
one
at
nine
and
the
other
at
ten
in
fact
it
was
nearly
eleven
when
he
awoke
his
head
was
splitting
with
pain
his
tongue
was
furry
and
his
mouth
tasted
like
he
made
wry
faces
passed
his
thick
tongue
around
his
dry
mouth
oh
so
damnably
dry
and
pressed
the
palms
of
his
hands
to
his
pounding
temples
he
craved
a
drink
of
cold
water
but
he
was
afraid
to
get
out
of
bed
he
felt
pathetically
weak
and
dizzy
norry
walked
into
the
room
and
stood
quietly
looking
at
him
get
me
a
drink
norry
please
hugh
begged
i
parched
he
rolled
over
ouch
god
how
my
head
aches
norry
brought
him
the
drink
but
nothing
less
than
three
glasses
even
began
to
satisfy
hugh
then
still
saying
nothing
norry
put
a
cold
compress
on
hugh
hot
forehead
thanks
norry
old
man
that
awfully
damn
good
of
you
norry
walked
out
of
the
room
and
hugh
quickly
fell
into
a
light
sleep
an
hour
later
he
woke
up
quite
unaware
of
the
fact
that
norry
had
changed
the
cold
compress
three
times
the
nap
had
refreshed
him
he
still
felt
weak
and
faint
but
his
head
no
longer
throbbed
and
his
throat
was
less
dry
norry
he
called
feebly
yes
norry
stood
in
the
doorway
feeling
better
yes
some
come
sit
down
on
the
bed
i
want
to
talk
to
you
but
get
me
another
drink
first
please
my
mouth
tastes
like
burnt
rubber
norry
gave
him
the
drink
and
then
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
silently
waiting
i
awfully
ashamed
of
myself
old
man
hugh
began
i
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
ca
remember
much
what
happened
i
remember
bringing
cynthia
up
here
and
you
coming
in
and
then
well
i
somehow
remember
anything
after
that
what
did
you
do
i
took
cynthia
home
and
then
came
back
and
put
you
to
bed
norry
gazed
at
the
floor
and
spoke
softly
you
took
cynthia
home
of
course
hugh
stared
at
him
in
awe
but
if
you
been
seen
with
her
in
the
dorm
you
have
been
fired
from
college
nobody
saw
us
it
all
right
hugh
wanted
to
cry
oh
lord
norry
you
white
he
exclaimed
the
whitest
fellow
that
ever
lived
you
took
that
chance
for
me
that
all
right
norry
was
painfully
embarrassed
and
i
such
a
rotter
you
you
know
what
we
came
up
here
for
i
can
guess
norry
glance
still
rested
on
the
floor
he
spoke
hardly
above
a
whisper
nothing
happened
i
swear
it
norry
i
meant
to
but
but
you
came
thank
god
i

but
i
disappointed

way
i
so
damned
ashamed

norry

very
near
to
tears
of
course
i

he
whispered
but
i
hope

it
again
i
wo
norry
i
promise

stopped
by
an
accident
i
go
straight
now
though
i
promise
you
norry
stood
up
it
nearly
noon
he
said
more
naturally
cynthia
will
be
wondering
where
you
are
cynthia
oh
norry
how
can
i
face
her
you
got
to
said
the
young
moralist
firmly
i
suppose
so
the
sinner
agreed
his
voice
miserably
lugubrious
god
after
three
cups
of
coffee
however
the
task
did
not
seem
so
impossible
hugh
entered
the
nu
delta
house
with
a
fairly
jaunty
air
and
greeted
the
men
and
women
easily
enough
his
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
he
saw
cynthia
standing
in
the
far
corner
of
the
she
was
wearing
her
scarlet
hat
and
blue
suit
she
saved
him
the
embarrassment
of
opening
the
conversation
come
into
the
library
she
said
softly
i
want
to
speak
to
you
wondering
and
rather
frightened
he
followed
her
i
going
home
this
afternoon
she
began
i
got
everything
packed
and
i
told
everybody
that
i
do
feel
very
well
you
are
sick
he
asked
really
worried
of
course
not
but
i
had
to
say
something
the
train
leaves
in
an
hour
or
two
and
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
before
i
go
but
hang
it
cynthia
think
of
what
you
missing
there
a
baseball
game
with
raleigh
this
afternoon
a
in
the
union
after
that
the
musical
clubs
concert
this
evening
i
sing
with
the
glee
club
and
norry
going
to
play
a
solo
and
i
in
the
banjo
club
too
and
we
are
going
to
have
a
farewell
dance
at
the
house
after
the
concert
hugh
pleaded
earnestly
but
somehow
down
in
his
heart
he
wished
that
she
would
stay
i
know
but
i
got
to
go
let
go
somewhere
out
in
the
woods
where
we
can
talk
without
being
disturbed
still
protesting
he
led
her
out
of
the
house
across
the
campus
past
the
lake
and
into
the
woods
finally
they
sat
down
on
a
smooth
rock
i
awfully
sorry
to
bust
up
your
party
hugh
cynthia
began
slowly
but
i
been
doing
some
thinking
and
i
just
got
to
beat
it
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
looked
him
square
in
the
eyes
do
you
love
me
for
an
instant
hugh
eyes
dropped
and
then
he
looked
up
and
lied
like
a
gentleman
yes
he
said
simply
i
love
you
cynthia
she
smiled
almost
wearily
and
shook
her
head
you
a
good
egg
hugh
it
was
white
of
you
to
say
that
but
i
know
that
you
do
love
me
you
did
yesterday
but
you
do
now
do
you
realize
that
you
have
asked
to
kiss
me
hugh
flushed
and
stammered
i
i
got
an
awful
cynthia
i
feel
rotten
yes
i
know
but
that
is
why
you
did
want
to
kiss
me
i
know
all
about
it
listen
hugh
she
faced
him
bravely
i
been
running
with
a
fast
crowd
for
three
years
and
i
learned
a
lot
about
fellows
and
most
of
that
i
known
were
your
kind
how
old
are
you
in
a
couple
of
months
i
twenty
and
lots
wiser
about
some
things
than
you
are
i
been
crazy
about
you
i
guess
i
am
kinda
yet
and
i
know
that
you
thought
you
were
in
love
with
me
i
wanted
you
to
have
hold
of
me
all
the
time
that
all
that
mattered
it
was
was
your
body
hugh
you
sweet
and
fine
and
i
respect
you
but
i
not
the
kid
for
you
to
run
around
with
i
too
fast
i
woke
up
early
this
morning
and
i
done
a
lot
of
thinking
since
you
know
what
we
came
near
doing
last
night
well
that
all
we
want
each
other
for
we
not
in
love
a
phrase
from
the
bull
sessions
rushed
into
hugh
mind
you
mean
sex
attraction
he
asked
in
some
embarrassment
he
felt
weak
and
tired
he
seemed
to
be
listening
to
cynthia
in
a
dream
nothing
was
real
and
everything
was
a
little
sad
yes
that
it
and
oh
hugh
somehow
i
do
want
that
with
you
we
not
the
same
kind
at
all
i
used
to
think
that
when
i
got
your
letters
sometimes
i
hardly
understood
them
but
i
close
my
eyes
and
see
you
so
strong
and
blond
and
clean
and
i
imagine
you
were
holding
me
tight
and
and
then
i
was
happy
i
guess
i
did
kinda
love
you
but
we
spoiled
it
she
wanted
desperately
to
cry
but
bit
her
lip
and
held
back
her
tears
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
cynthia
hugh
said
softly
i
do
know
much
about
love
and
sex
attraction
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
know
that
i
was
happier
kissing
you
than
i
ever
been
in
my
life
i
i
wish
that
last
night
had
happened
i
hate
myself
you
need
it
was
more
my
fault
than
yours
i
a
pretty
bad
egg
i
guess
and
the
booze
and
you
holding
me
was
too
much
i
hate
myself
too
i
spoiled
the
nicest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
she
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
bright
with
tears
i
love
you
hugh
i
loved
you
as
much
as
i
could
love
any
one
hugh
put
his
arms
around
her
and
drew
her
to
him
then
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
gently
there
was
no
passion
in
his
embrace
but
there
was
infinite
tenderness
he
felt
spiritually
and
physically
weak
as
if
all
his
emotional
resources
had
been
quite
spent
i
think
that
i
love
you
more
than
i
ever
did
before
he
whispered
if
he
had
shown
any
passion
if
there
had
been
any
warmth
in
his
kiss
cynthia
might
have
believed
him
but
she
was
aware
only
of
his
gentleness
she
pushed
him
back
and
drew
out
of
his
arms
no
she
said
sharply
you
do
love
me
you
just
sorry
for
me
you
just
kind
hugh
had
read
marpessa
many
times
and
a
line
from
it
came
to
make
her
attitude
clear
thou
wouldst
grow
kind
most
bitter
to
a
woman
that
was
loved
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
he
said
miserably
let
not
call
everything
off
now
cynthia
let
wait
a
while
no
she
stood
up
decisively
no
i
hate
loose
ends
she
glanced
at
her
tiny
if
i
going
to
make
that
train
i
got
to
hurry
we
got
barely
half
an
hour
come
hugh
be
a
sport
he
stood
up
his
face
white
and
weary
his
blue
eyes
dull
and
sad
just
as
you
say
cynthia
he
said
slowly
but
i
going
to
miss
you
like
hell
she
did
not
reply
but
started
silently
for
the
path
he
followed
her
and
they
walked
back
to
the
fraternity
house
without
saying
a
word
both
busy
with
unhappy
thoughts
when
they
reached
the
fraternity
she
got
her
handed
it
to
him
declined
his
offer
of
a
taxi
and
walked
unhappily
by
his
side
down
the
hill
that
they
had
climbed
so
gaily
two
days
before
hugh
had
just
time
to
get
her
ticket
before
the
train
started
she
paused
a
moment
at
the
car
steps
and
held
out
her
hand
hugh
she
said
softly
her
lips
trembling
her
eyes
full
of
tears
cynthia
he
whispered
and
then
foolishly
thanks
for
coming
she
did
not
smile
but
drew
her
hand
from
his
and
mounted
the
steps
an
instant
later
she
was
inside
the
car
and
the
train
was
moving
numbed
and
miserable
hugh
slowly
climbed
the
hill
and
wandered
back
to
norry
parker
room
he
was
glad
that
norry
was
there
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
a
few
minutes
trying
to
think
then
he
threw
himself
despairingly
on
a
couch
face
down
he
wanted
to
cry
he
had
never
wanted
so
much
to
cry
and
he
could
there
were
no
tears
and
he
had
lost
something
very
precious
he
thought
it
was
love
it
was
only
his
dreams
chapter
xxiii
for
several
days
hugh
was
tortured
by
doubt
and
indecision
there
were
times
when
he
thought
that
he
loved
cynthia
times
when
he
was
sure
that
he
did
when
he
had
just
about
made
up
his
mind
that
he
hated
her
he
found
himself
planning
to
follow
her
to
new
rochelle
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
his
conduct
was
no
more
reprehensible
than
that
of
his
comrades
but
shame
invariably
overwhelmed
his
arguments
there
were
hours
when
he
ached
for
cynthia
and
hours
when
he
loathed
her
for
smashing
something
that
had
been
beautiful
most
of
all
he
wanted
comfort
advice
but
he
knew
no
one
to
whom
he
was
willing
to
give
his
confidence
somehow
he
could
admit
his
drunkenness
to
any
one
whose
advice
he
valued
he
called
on
professor
henley
twice
intending
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
his
transgressions
henley
he
knew
would
not
lecture
him
but
when
he
found
himself
facing
him
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
confession
he
was
afraid
of
losing
henley
respect
finally
in
desperation
he
talked
to
norry
not
because
he
thought
norry
could
help
him
but
because
he
had
to
talk
to
somebody
and
norry
already
knew
the
worst
they
went
walking
far
out
into
the
country
idly
discussing
campus
gossip
or
pausing
to
revel
in
the
beauty
of
the
night
the
clear
clean
sky
the
pale
moon
the
fireflies
sparkling
suddenly
over
the
meadows
or
even
to
the
weary
from
their
long
walk
they
sat
down
on
a
stump
and
hugh
let
the
dam
of
his
emotion
break
norry
he
began
intensely
i
in
hell
in
hell
it
a
week
since
prom
and
i
have
had
a
line
from
cynthia
i
have
dared
write
to
her
why
not
she
she
oh
damn
it
she
told
me
before
she
left
that
everything
was
all
off
that
why
she
left
early
she
said
that
we
did
love
each
other
that
all
we
felt
was
sex
attraction
i
do
know
whether
right
or
not
but
i
miss
her
like
the
devil
i
i
feel
empty
sort
of
hollow
inside
as
if
everything
had
suddenly
been
poured
out
of
me
and
there
nothing
to
take
its
place
i
was
full
of
cynthia
you
see
and
now
there
no
cynthia
there
nothing
left
but
oh
god
norry
ashamed
of
myself
i
feel
dirty
the
last
word
was
hardly
audible
norry
touched
his
arm
i
know
hugh
and
i
awfully
sorry
i
think
though
that
cynthia
was
right
i
know
her
better
than
you
do
she
an
awfully
good
kid
but
not
your
kind
at
all
i
think
i
feel
as
badly
almost
as
you
do
about
it
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
simply
i
was
so
proud
of
you
hugh
do
hugh
exclaimed
i
want
to
kill
myself
when
you
say
things
like
that
you
do
understand
i
know
that
you
do
understand
i
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
since
prom
too
i
thought
over
a
lot
of
things
that
you
said
to
me
about
me
i
mean
why
hugh
you
think
i
not
human
i
do
believe
you
think
i
have
passions
like
the
rest
of
you
well
i
do
and
sometimes
it
it
awful
i
telling
you
that
so
you
understand
that
i
know
how
you
feel
but
love
beautiful
to
me
hugh
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
i
was
in
love
with
a
girl
once
and
i
know
she
did
give
a
hang
for
me
she
thought
i
was
a
baby
i
suffered
awfully
but
i
know
that
my
love
was
beautiful
as
beautiful
as
he
looked
around
for
a
simile
as
i
think
it
because
of
that
that
i
hate
mugging
and
petting
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
want
beauty
debased
i
want
to
fight
when
orchestras
jazz
famous
arias
well
petting
is
jazzing
love
and
i
hate
it
do
you
see
what
i
mean
hugh
looked
at
him
wonderingly
he
did
know
this
norry
at
all
yes
he
said
slowly
yes
i
see
what
you
mean
i
think
i
do
anyway
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
well
i
know
most
of
the
fellows
pet
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
they
do
think
anything
about
it
but
you
different
you
love
beautiful
things
as
much
as
i
do
you
told
me
yourself
that
jimmie
henley
said
last
year
that
you
were
gifted
you
can
write
and
sing
and
run
but
i
just
realized
that
you
are
proud
of
those
things
at
all
you
just
take
them
for
granted
and
you
ashamed
that
you
write
poetry
some
of
your
poems
are
good
but
you
have
sent
any
of
them
to
the
poetry
magazine
you
do
want
anybody
to
know
that
you
write
poetry
you
trying
to
make
yourself
like
fellows
that
are
inferior
to
you
norry
was
piteously
in
earnest
his
hero
had
crumbled
into
clay
before
his
eyes
and
he
was
trying
to
patch
him
together
again
preparatory
to
boosting
him
back
upon
his
pedestal
oh
cripes
norry
hugh
said
a
little
impatiently
you
exaggerate
all
my
virtues
you
always
have
i
not
half
the
fellow
you
think
i
am
i
do
love
beautiful
things
but
i
do
believe
my
poetry
is
any
good
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
confessed
mournfully
i
admit
though
that
i
have
been
going
downhill
i
going
to
do
better
from
now
on
you
watch
me
they
talked
for
hours
norry
embarrassing
hugh
with
the
frankness
of
his
admiration
norry
had
always
embarrassed
him
but
he
did
like
it
when
the
worshiper
began
to
criticize
he
admitted
the
justness
of
the
criticism
but
it
hurt
him
just
the
same
perching
on
a
pedestal
had
been
uncomfortable
but
a
little
thrilling
sitting
on
the
ground
and
gazing
up
at
his
perch
was
rather
humiliating
the
fall
had
bruised
him
and
norry
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
was
kicking
the
bruises
nevertheless
he
felt
better
after
the
talk
determined
to
win
back
norry
esteem
and
his
own
he
swore
off
smoking
and
drinking
and
stuck
to
his
oath
he
told
vinton
that
if
he
brought
any
more
liquor
to
their
room
one
of
them
was
going
to
be
carried
out
and
that
he
had
a
hunch
that
it
would
be
vinton
vinton
gazed
at
him
with
round
eyes
and
believed
him
after
that
he
did
his
drinking
elsewhere
confiding
to
his
cronies
that
carver
was
on
the
wagon
and
that
he
had
got
as
religious
as
holy
hell
he
wo
let
me
drink
in
my
own
room
he
wailed
dolorously
and
then
with
a
sudden
burst
of
clairvoyance
he
added
i
guess
his
girl
has
given
him
the
gate
for
weeks
the
campus
buzzed
with
talk
about
the
prom
a
dozen
men
who
had
been
detected
were
summarily
expelled
many
others
who
had
been
equally
guilty
were
in
a
constant
state
of
mental
would
the
next
mail
bring
a
summons
from
the
dean
president
culver
spoke
sternly
in
chapel
and
hinted
that
there
would
be
no
prom
the
coming
year
most
of
the
men
said
that
the
prom
had
been
an
awful
brawl
but
there
were
some
who
insisted
that
it
was
no
worse
than
the
proms
held
at
other
colleges
and
recited
startling
tales
in
support
of
their
argument
leonard
gates
finally
settled
the
whole
matter
for
hugh
there
had
been
many
discussions
in
the
nu
delta
about
the
prom
and
in
one
of
them
gates
ended
the
argument
with
a
sane
and
thoughtful
statement
the
prom
was
a
brawl
he
said
seriously
a
drunken
brawl
we
all
admit
that
the
fact
that
proms
at
other
colleges
are
brawls
too
does
make
ours
any
more
respectable
if
a
yale
man
happens
to
commit
murder
and
gets
away
with
it
that
is
no
reason
that
a
harvard
man
or
a
sanford
man
should
commit
murder
too
some
of
you
are
arguing
like
babies
but
some
of
you
are
going
to
the
other
extreme
you
talk
as
if
everybody
at
the
prom
was
lit
well
i
was
lit
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
them
were
lit
just
use
a
little
common
sense
there
were
three
hundred
and
fifty
couples
at
the
prom
now
not
half
of
them
even
had
a
drink
say
that
half
did
that
makes
one
hundred
and
fellows
if
fifty
of
those
fellows
were
really
soused
i
eat
my
hat
but
we
say
that
there
were
fifty
fifty
were
quite
enough
to
make
the
whole
prom
look
like
a
longshoreman
ball
got
to
take
the
music
into
consideration
too
that
orchestra
could
certainly
play
jazz
it
could
play
it
too
damn
well
why
that
music
was
enough
to
make
a
saint
shed
his
halo
and
shake
a
shimmy
what
i
getting
to
is
this
there
are
over
a
thousand
fellows
in
college
and
out
of
that
thousand
not
more
than
fifty
were
really
soused
at
the
prom
and
not
more
than
a
hundred
and
were
even
a
little
teed
to
go
around
saying
that
sanford
men
are
a
lot
of
muckers
just
because
a
small
fraction
of
them
acted
like
is
sheer
bunk
the
prom
was
a
drunken
brawl
but
all
sanford
men
drunkards
not
by
a
damn
sight
hugh
had
to
admit
the
force
of
gates
reasoning
and
he
found
comfort
in
it
he
had
been
just
about
ready
to
believe
that
all
college
men
and
sanford
men
in
particular
were
hardly
better
than
common
muckers
but
in
the
end
the
comfort
that
he
got
was
small
he
realized
bitterly
that
he
was
one
of
the
minority
that
had
disgraced
his
college
he
was
one
of
the
the
recognition
of
that
undeniable
fact
cut
deep
he
was
determined
to
redeem
himself
he
to
somehow
living
a
life
of
perfect
rectitude
was
not
enough
he
had
to
do
something
that
would
win
back
his
own
respect
and
the
respect
of
his
fellows
which
he
thought
quite
absurdly
that
he
had
forfeited
so
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
only
one
way
that
he
could
justify
his
existence
at
sanford
that
was
to
win
one
of
the
dashes
in
the
meet
he
clung
to
that
idea
with
the
tenacity
of
a
fanatic
he
had
nearly
a
month
in
which
to
train
and
train
he
did
as
he
never
had
before
his
diet
became
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
a
was
a
holy
rite
and
the
words
of
jansen
the
coach
divine
gospel
he
placed
in
both
of
the
preliminary
meets
but
he
knew
that
he
could
do
better
he
was
yet
in
condition
when
the
day
for
the
meet
finally
came
he
did
not
feel
any
of
the
nervousness
that
had
spelled
defeat
for
him
in
his
freshman
year
he
was
stonily
calm
silently
determined
he
was
going
to
place
in
the
hundred
and
win
the
or
die
in
the
attempt
no
golden
dreams
of
breaking
records
excited
him
calvert
of
raleigh
was
running
the
hundred
consistently
in
ten
seconds
and
had
been
credited
with
better
time
hugh
had
no
hopes
of
defeating
him
in
the
hundred
but
there
was
a
chance
in
the
calvert
was
a
man
the
shorter
the
better
two
hundred
and
twenty
yards
was
a
little
too
far
for
him
calvert
did
not
look
like
a
runner
he
was
a
good
two
inches
shorter
than
hugh
who
lacked
nearly
that
much
of
six
feet
calvert
was
heavily
built
a
dark
brawny
chap
both
quick
and
powerful
hugh
looked
at
him
and
for
a
moment
hated
him
although
he
did
not
phrase
it
so
in
fact
he
did
not
phrase
it
at
all
calvert
was
his
obstacle
in
his
race
for
redemption
calvert
won
the
dash
in
ten
seconds
flat
breaking
the
record
hugh
running
faster
than
he
ever
had
in
his
life
barely
managed
to
come
in
second
ahead
of
his
murphy
the
sanford
men
cheered
him
lustily
but
he
hardly
listened
he
to
win
the
at
last
the
runners
were
called
to
the
they
danced
up
and
down
the
track
flexing
their
muscles
hugh
was
tense
but
more
determined
than
nervous
calvert
pranced
around
easily
he
seemed
entirely
recovered
from
his
great
effort
in
the
hundred
finally
the
starter
called
them
to
their
marks
they
tried
their
spikes
in
the
scraped
them
out
a
bit
more
made
a
few
trial
dashes
and
finally
knelt
in
line
at
the
command
of
the
starter
hugh
expected
calvert
to
lead
for
the
first
hundred
yards
but
the
last
hundred
that
was
where
calvert
would
weaken
calvert
was
sure
to
be
ahead
at
the
beginning
but
after
that
on
your
marks
set
the
pistol
cracked
the
start
was
perfect
the
five
men
leaped
forward
almost
exactly
together
for
once
calvert
had
not
beaten
the
others
off
the
mark
but
he
immediately
drew
ahead
he
was
running
powerfully
his
legs
rising
and
falling
in
exact
rhythm
his
spikes
tearing
into
the
cinder
path
but
hugh
and
murphy
were
pressing
him
close
at
the
end
of
the
first
hundred
calvert
led
by
a
yard
hugh
pounded
on
murphy
falling
behind
him
the
others
were
hopelessly
outclassed
hugh
did
not
think
he
did
not
hear
a
thousand
men
shouting
hysterically
carver
carver
he
saw
nothing
but
calvert
a
yard
ahead
of
him
he
knew
nothing
but
that
he
had
to
make
up
that
yard
down
the
track
they
sped
their
breath
bursting
from
them
their
hands
clenched
their
faces
grotesquely
distorted
their
legs
driving
them
splendidly
on
hugh
was
gaining
that
yard
was
closing
he
sensed
it
rather
than
saw
it
he
saw
nothing
now
not
even
calvert
blinded
with
effort
his
lungs
aching
his
heart
pounding
terribly
he
fought
on
mechanically
keeping
between
the
two
white
lines
ten
yards
from
the
tape
he
was
almost
abreast
of
calvert
he
saw
the
tape
through
a
red
haze
he
made
a
final
valiant
leap
for
it
but
he
never
touched
it
calvert
chest
had
broken
it
a
tiny
fraction
of
a
second
before
hugh
almost
collapsed
after
the
race
two
men
caught
him
and
carried
him
despite
his
protests
to
the
at
first
he
was
aware
only
of
his
overwhelming
weariness
something
very
important
had
happened
it
was
over
and
he
was
tired
infinitely
tired
a
refreshed
his
muscles
but
his
spirit
remained
weary
for
a
month
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
that
race
even
cynthia
had
become
strangely
insignificant
in
comparison
with
it
and
now
that
the
race
had
been
run
and
lost
his
whole
spirit
sagged
and
drooped
he
was
pounded
on
the
back
his
hand
was
grasped
and
shaken
until
it
ached
he
was
cheered
to
an
echo
by
the
thrilled
sanford
men
but
still
his
depression
remained
he
had
won
his
letter
he
had
run
a
magnificent
race
all
sanford
sang
his
praise
norry
parker
had
actually
cried
with
excitement
and
delight
but
he
felt
that
he
had
failed
he
had
not
justified
himself
a
few
days
later
he
entered
henley
office
intending
to
make
only
a
brief
visit
henley
congratulated
him
you
were
wonderful
hugh
he
said
enthusiastically
the
way
that
you
crawled
up
on
him
the
last
hundred
yards
was
thrilling
i
shouted
until
i
was
hoarse
i
never
saw
any
one
fight
more
gamely
he
a
faster
man
than
you
are
but
you
almost
beat
him
i
congratulate
you
excuse
the
word
please
on
your
guts
somehow
hugh
could
stand
henley
enthusiasm
suddenly
he
blurted
out
the
whole
story
his
drunkenness
at
the
prom
his
split
with
cynthia
he
did
not
mention
the
visit
to
norry
room
his
determination
to
redeem
himself
his
feeling
that
if
he
had
won
that
race
he
would
at
least
have
justified
his
existence
at
the
college
and
finally
his
sense
of
failure
henley
listened
sympathetically
amused
and
touched
by
the
boy
naive
philosophy
he
did
not
tell
him
that
the
race
was
relatively
unimportant
he
was
sure
that
hugh
would
find
that
out
for
himself
but
he
did
bring
him
comfort
you
did
not
fail
hugh
he
said
gently
you
succeeded
magnificently
as
for
serving
your
college
you
can
always
serve
it
best
by
being
yourself
being
true
to
yourself
i
mean
and
that
means
being
the
very
fine
gentleman
that
you
are
he
paused
a
minute
aware
that
he
must
be
less
personal
hugh
was
red
to
the
hair
and
gazing
unhappily
at
the
floor
you
must
read
browning
he
went
on
and
learn
about
his
philosophy
he
maintains
that
it
is
better
to
strive
for
a
million
and
miss
it
than
to
strive
for
a
hundred
and
get
it
man
reach
should
exceed
his
grasp
or
what
a
heaven
for
he
says
it
in
a
dozen
different
ways
it
the
man
who
tries
bravely
for
something
beyond
his
power
that
gets
somewhere
the
man
who
really
succeeds
well
you
tried
for
something
beyond
your
power
to
beat
calvert
a
really
great
runner
you
tried
to
your
utmost
therefore
you
succeeded
i
admire
your
sense
of
failure
it
means
that
you
recognize
an
ideal
but
i
think
that
you
succeeded
you
may
not
have
quite
justified
yourself
to
yourself
but
you
have
proved
capable
of
enduring
a
hard
test
bravely
you
have
no
reason
to
be
depressed
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
they
talked
for
a
long
time
and
finally
henley
confessed
that
he
thought
cynthia
had
been
wise
in
taking
herself
out
of
hugh
life
i
can
see
he
said
that
you
are
telling
me
quite
all
the
story
i
do
want
you
to
either
i
judge
however
from
what
you
have
said
that
you
went
somewhere
with
her
and
that
only
complete
drunkenness
saved
you
from
disgracing
both
yourself
and
her
you
need
no
lecture
i
am
sure
you
are
sufficiently
contrite
i
have
a
feeling
that
she
was
right
about
sexual
attraction
being
paramount
and
i
think
that
she
is
a
very
brave
girl
i
like
the
way
she
went
home
and
i
like
the
way
she
has
kept
silent
not
many
girls
could
or
would
do
that
it
takes
courage
from
what
you
have
said
however
i
imagine
that
she
is
not
your
kind
at
least
that
she
is
the
kind
that
is
good
for
you
you
have
suffered
and
are
suffering
i
know
but
i
am
sure
that
some
day
you
are
going
to
be
very
grateful
to
that
girl
for
a
good
many
reasons
hugh
felt
better
after
that
talk
and
the
end
of
the
term
brought
him
a
surprise
that
wiped
out
his
depression
and
his
sense
of
failure
he
found
too
that
his
pain
was
growing
less
the
wound
was
healing
perversely
he
hated
it
for
healing
and
he
poked
it
viciously
to
feel
it
throb
agony
had
become
sweet
it
made
life
more
intense
less
beautiful
perhaps
but
more
wonderful
more
real
romantically
too
he
felt
that
he
must
be
true
both
to
his
love
and
to
his
sorrow
and
his
love
was
fading
into
a
memory
that
was
plaintively
gray
but
shot
with
scarlet
thrills
and
his
sorrow
was
bowing
before
the
relentless
excitement
of
his
daily
life
the
surprise
that
rehabilitated
him
in
his
own
respect
was
his
election
to
the
boulé
the
senior
council
and
governing
board
of
the
student
body
it
was
the
greatest
honor
that
an
undergraduate
could
receive
and
hugh
had
in
no
way
expected
it
when
nu
delta
had
first
suggested
to
him
that
he
be
a
candidate
he
had
demurred
saying
that
there
were
other
men
in
his
delegation
better
fitted
to
serve
and
with
better
chances
of
election
leonard
gates
however
felt
otherwise
and
before
hugh
knew
what
had
happened
he
was
a
candidate
along
with
thirty
other
juniors
only
twelve
of
whom
could
be
elected
he
took
no
part
in
the
campaigning
attended
none
of
the
caucuses
was
hardly
interested
in
the
fraternity
combine
that
promised
to
elect
him
he
did
not
believe
that
he
could
be
elected
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
be
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
gates
and
others
well
knew
his
chances
were
more
than
good
hugh
was
popular
in
his
own
right
and
his
great
race
in
the
meet
had
made
him
something
of
a
hero
for
the
time
being
furthermore
he
was
a
member
of
both
the
glee
and
banjo
clubs
he
had
led
his
class
in
the
spring
sings
for
three
years
and
he
had
a
respectable
record
in
his
studies
the
tapping
took
place
in
chapel
the
last
week
of
classes
after
the
first
hymn
the
retiring
members
of
the
boulé
rose
and
marched
down
the
aisle
to
where
the
juniors
were
sitting
the
new
members
were
tapped
in
the
order
of
the
number
of
votes
that
they
had
received
and
the
first
man
tapped
having
received
the
largest
number
of
votes
automatically
became
president
of
the
boulé
for
the
coming
year
hugh
interest
naturally
picked
up
the
day
of
the
election
and
he
began
to
have
faint
hopes
that
he
would
be
the
tenth
or
eleventh
man
to
his
enormous
surprise
he
was
tapped
third
and
he
marched
down
the
aisle
to
the
front
seat
reserved
for
the
new
members
with
the
applause
of
his
fellows
sweet
in
his
ears
it
did
seem
possible
he
was
one
of
the
most
popular
and
most
respected
men
in
his
class
he
could
not
understand
it
but
he
did
particularly
care
to
understand
it
the
honor
was
enough
nu
delta
tried
to
heap
further
honors
on
him
but
he
declined
them
as
a
member
of
boulé
he
was
naturally
nominated
for
the
presidency
of
the
chapter
quite
properly
he
felt
that
he
was
not
fitted
for
such
a
position
and
he
retired
in
favor
of
john
lawrence
the
only
man
in
his
delegation
really
capable
of
controlling
the
brothers
lawrence
was
a
man
like
gates
he
would
hugh
knew
carry
on
the
constructive
work
that
gates
had
so
splendidly
started
nu
delta
was
in
the
throes
of
one
of
those
changes
so
characteristic
of
fraternities
chapter
xxiv
hugh
spent
his
last
college
vacation
at
home
working
on
the
farm
reading
occasionally
dancing
at
corley
lake
and
thinking
a
great
deal
he
saw
janet
harton
now
janet
moffitt
several
times
at
the
lake
and
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
adored
her
she
was
still
childlike
still
dainty
and
pretty
but
to
hugh
she
was
merely
a
talking
doll
and
he
felt
a
little
sorry
for
her
burly
rather
stupid
husband
who
lumbered
about
after
her
like
a
protecting
he
met
plenty
of
pretty
girls
at
the
lake
but
as
he
said
he
was
off
women
for
good
he
was
afraid
of
them
he
had
been
severely
burnt
and
while
the
fire
still
fascinated
him
it
frightened
him
too
women
he
was
sure
were
shallow
creatures
dangerous
to
a
man
peace
of
mind
and
they
were
all
right
to
dance
with
and
pet
a
bit
but
that
was
all
absolutely
all
he
thought
a
lot
about
girls
that
summer
and
even
more
about
his
life
after
graduation
from
college
what
was
he
going
to
do
life
stretched
ahead
of
him
for
one
year
like
a
smooth
flowered
plain
and
then
the
abyss
he
felt
prepared
to
do
nothing
at
all
and
he
was
not
swept
by
an
overpowering
desire
to
do
anything
in
particular
writing
had
the
greatest
appeal
for
him
but
he
doubted
his
ability
teach
perhaps
but
teaching
meant
graduate
work
well
he
would
see
what
the
next
year
at
college
would
show
he
was
going
to
take
a
course
in
composition
with
professor
henley
and
if
henley
thought
his
gifts
warranted
it
he
would
ask
his
father
for
a
year
or
two
of
graduate
work
at
harvard
college
was
pleasant
that
last
year
it
was
pleasant
to
wear
a
blue
sweater
with
an
orange
s
on
it
it
was
pleasant
too
to
wear
a
small
white
hat
that
had
a
blue
b
on
the
crown
the
insignia
of
the
boulé
and
a
sign
that
he
was
a
person
to
be
respected
and
obeyed
it
was
pleasant
to
be
spoken
to
by
the
professors
as
one
who
had
reached
something
approaching
manhood
life
generally
was
pleasant
not
so
exciting
as
the
three
preceding
years
but
fuller
and
richer
early
in
the
first
term
he
was
elected
to
helmer
an
honor
society
that
possessed
a
granite
tomb
a
small
windowless
building
in
which
the
members
were
supposed
to
discuss
questions
of
great
importance
and
practice
secret
rites
of
wonder
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
monthly
meetings
were
nothing
but
bull
fests
or
as
one
cynical
member
put
it
we
wear
a
gold
helmet
on
our
sweaters
and
chew
the
fat
once
a
month
true
enough
but
that
gold
helmet
glittered
enticingly
in
the
eyes
of
every
student
who
did
not
possess
one
for
the
first
time
hugh
studies
meant
more
to
him
than
the
undergraduate
life
he
had
chosen
his
instructors
carefully
having
learned
from
three
years
of
experience
that
the
instructor
was
far
more
important
than
the
title
of
the
course
he
had
three
classes
in
literature
one
in
music
partly
because
it
was
a
snap
and
partly
because
he
really
wanted
to
know
more
about
music
and
his
composition
course
with
henley
to
him
the
most
important
of
the
lot
he
really
studied
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
term
received
three
and
two
b
a
very
creditable
record
what
was
more
important
than
his
record
however
was
the
fact
that
he
was
really
enjoying
his
work
he
was
intellectually
awakened
and
hungry
for
learning
also
for
the
first
time
he
really
enjoyed
the
fraternity
jack
lawrence
was
proving
an
able
president
and
nu
delta
pledged
a
freshman
delegation
of
which
hugh
was
genuinely
proud
there
were
plenty
of
men
in
the
chapter
whom
he
did
not
like
or
toward
whom
he
was
indifferent
but
he
had
learned
to
ignore
them
and
center
his
interest
in
those
men
whom
he
found
congenial
the
first
term
was
ideal
but
the
second
became
a
maelstrom
of
doubt
and
trouble
in
which
he
whirled
madly
around
trying
to
find
some
philosophy
that
would
solve
his
difficulties
when
norry
returned
to
college
after
the
christmas
vacation
he
told
hugh
that
he
had
seen
cynthia
naturally
hugh
was
interested
and
the
mere
mention
of
cynthia
name
was
still
enough
to
quicken
his
pulse
how
did
she
look
he
asked
eagerly
awful
what
what
the
matter
is
she
sick
norry
shook
his
head
no
i
do
think
she
is
exactly
sick
he
said
gravely
but
something
is
the
matter
with
her
you
know
she
has
been
going
an
awful
pace
tearing
around
like
crazy
i
told
you
that
i
know
when
i
came
back
in
the
fall
well
she
kept
it
up
and
i
guess
about
all
in
i
could
understand
it
cynthia
always
run
with
a
fast
bunch
but
she
never
had
a
bad
name
she
beginning
to
get
one
now
no
hugh
was
honestly
troubled
what
the
matter
anyway
did
you
try
to
stop
her
norry
smiled
of
course
not
can
you
imagine
me
stopping
cynthia
from
doing
anything
she
wanted
to
do
but
i
did
have
a
talk
with
her
she
got
hold
of
me
one
night
at
the
country
club
and
pulled
me
off
in
a
corner
she
wanted
to
talk
about
you
me
hugh
heart
was
beginning
to
pound
what
did
she
say
she
asked
questions
she
wanted
to
know
everything
about
you
i
guess
she
asked
me
a
thousand
questions
she
wanted
to
know
how
you
looked
how
you
were
doing
in
your
courses
where
you
were
during
vacation
if
you
had
a
girl
oh
everything
and
finally
she
asked
if
you
ever
talked
about
her
what
did
you
say
hugh
demanded
breathlessly
i
told
her
yes
of
course
gee
hugh
i
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
we
talked
some
more
all
about
you
she
crazy
about
you
hugh
sure
of
it
and
i
think
that
why
she
been
hitting
the
high
spots
i
felt
sorry
as
the
devil
for
her
poor
kid
gee
that
tough
that
damn
tough
did
she
send
me
any
message
no
i
asked
her
if
she
wanted
to
send
her
love
or
anything
and
she
said
she
guessed
not
i
think
she
having
an
awful
time
hugh
that
talk
tore
hugh
peace
of
mind
into
quivering
shreds
cynthia
was
with
him
every
waking
minute
and
with
her
a
sense
of
guilt
that
would
not
down
he
knew
that
if
he
wrote
to
her
he
might
involve
himself
in
a
very
difficult
situation
but
the
temptation
was
stronger
than
his
discretion
he
wanted
to
know
if
norry
was
right
and
he
knew
that
he
would
never
have
an
hour
real
comfort
until
he
found
out
cynthia
had
told
him
that
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
she
had
said
definitely
that
their
attraction
for
each
other
was
merely
sexual
had
she
lied
to
him
had
she
gone
home
in
the
middle
of
prom
week
because
she
thought
she
ought
to
save
him
from
herself
he
could
decide
and
he
felt
that
he
had
to
know
if
cynthia
was
unhappy
and
he
was
the
cause
of
her
unhappiness
he
wanted
he
assured
himself
to
do
the
right
thing
and
he
had
very
vague
notions
indeed
of
what
the
right
thing
might
be
finally
he
wrote
to
her
the
letter
took
him
hours
to
write
but
he
flattered
himself
that
it
was
very
discreet
it
implied
nothing
and
demanded
nothing
dear
cynthia
i
had
a
talk
with
norry
parker
recently
that
has
troubled
me
a
great
deal
he
said
that
you
seemed
both
unwell
and
unhappy
and
he
felt
that
i
was
in
some
way
responsible
for
your
depression
of
course
we
both
know
how
ingenuous
and
romantic
norry
is
he
can
find
tragedy
in
a
cut
finger
i
recognize
that
fact
but
what
he
told
me
has
given
me
no
end
of
worry
just
the
same
wo
you
please
write
to
me
just
what
is
wrong
if
anything
really
is
and
if
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
shall
continue
to
worry
until
i
get
your
letter
most
sincerely
hugh
weeks
went
by
and
no
answer
came
hugh
confusion
increased
he
thought
of
writing
her
another
letter
but
pride
and
common
sense
forbade
then
her
letter
came
and
all
of
his
props
were
kicked
suddenly
from
under
him
oh
my
dear
my
dear
she
wrote
i
swore
that
i
answer
your
letter
and
here
i
am
doing
it
i
fought
and
fought
and
fought
until
i
ca
fight
any
longer
i
held
out
as
long
as
i
can
oh
hugh
my
dearest
i
love
you
i
ca
help
it
i
do
i
do
i
tried
so
hard
not
to
and
when
i
found
that
i
could
help
it
i
swore
that
i
would
never
let
you
know
because
i
knew
that
you
did
love
me
and
that
i
am
bad
for
you
i
thought
i
loved
you
enough
to
give
you
up
and
i
might
have
succeeded
if
you
had
written
to
me
oh
hugh
dearest
i
nearly
fainted
when
i
saw
your
letter
i
hardly
dared
open
it
i
just
looked
and
looked
at
your
beloved
handwriting
i
cried
when
i
did
read
it
i
thought
of
the
letters
you
used
to
write
to
me
and
this
one
was
so
different
so
cold
and
impersonal
it
hurt
me
dreadfully
i
said
that
i
would
answer
it
i
swore
that
i
would
and
then
i
read
your
old
letters
i
kept
every
one
of
them
and
looked
at
your
picture
and
you
just
seemed
to
be
here
i
could
see
your
sweet
smile
and
feel
your
dear
arms
around
me
and
hugh
my
darling
i
had
to
write
i
to
my
pride
is
all
gone
i
ca
think
any
more
you
are
all
that
matters
oh
hugh
dearest
i
love
you
so
damned
hard
cynthia
two
hours
after
the
letter
arrived
it
was
followed
by
a
telegram
do
pay
any
attention
to
my
letter
i
was
crazy
when
i
wrote
it
hugh
had
sense
enough
to
pay
no
attention
to
the
telegram
he
tossed
it
into
the
fireplace
and
reread
the
letter
what
could
he
do
what
he
do
he
was
torn
by
doubt
and
confusion
he
looked
at
her
picture
and
all
his
old
longing
for
her
returned
but
he
had
learned
to
distrust
that
longing
he
had
got
along
for
a
year
without
her
he
had
almost
ceased
thinking
of
her
when
norry
brought
her
back
to
his
mind
he
had
to
answer
her
letter
what
could
he
say
he
paced
the
floor
of
his
room
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
pounded
his
forehead
but
no
solution
came
he
took
a
long
walk
into
the
country
and
came
back
more
confused
than
ever
he
was
flattered
by
her
letter
moved
by
it
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
loved
her
as
she
loved
him
and
he
could
not
do
it
his
passion
for
her
was
no
longer
overpowering
and
no
amount
of
thinking
could
make
it
so
in
the
end
he
temporized
his
letter
was
brief
dear
cynthia
there
is
no
need
i
guess
to
tell
you
that
your
letter
swept
me
clean
off
my
feet
i
am
still
dizzy
with
confusion
i
do
know
what
to
say
and
i
have
decided
that
it
is
best
for
me
not
to
say
anything
until
i
know
my
own
mind
i
could
be
fair
either
to
you
or
myself
otherwise
and
i
want
to
be
fair
i
must
be
give
me
time
please
it
is
because
i
care
so
much
for
you
that
i
ask
it
do
worry
if
you
do
hear
from
me
for
weeks
my
silence
wo
mean
that
i
have
forgotten
you
it
will
mean
that
i
am
thinking
of
you
sincerely
hugh
her
answer
came
promptly
hugh
my
dear
i
was
a
fish
to
write
that
letter
and
i
know
that
never
forgive
myself
but
i
could
help
it
i
just
could
help
it
i
am
glad
that
you
are
keeping
your
head
because
i
lost
mine
entirely
take
all
the
time
you
like
do
you
hate
me
for
losing
my
pride
i
do
your
stupid
cynthia
weeks
went
by
and
hugh
found
no
solution
he
damned
college
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
what
good
had
it
done
him
anyway
here
he
was
with
a
serious
problem
on
his
hands
and
he
could
solve
it
any
better
than
he
could
have
when
he
was
a
freshman
four
years
of
studying
and
lectures
and
examinations
and
the
first
time
he
bucked
up
against
a
bit
of
life
he
was
licked
eventually
he
wrote
to
her
and
told
her
that
he
was
fonder
of
her
than
he
was
of
any
girl
that
he
had
ever
known
but
that
he
did
know
whether
he
was
in
love
with
her
or
not
i
have
learned
to
distrust
my
own
emotions
he
wrote
and
my
own
decisions
the
more
i
think
the
more
bewildered
i
become
i
am
afraid
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
for
fear
that
i
wreck
both
our
lives
and
i
afraid
not
to
ask
you
for
the
same
reason
do
you
think
that
time
will
solve
our
problem
i
know
i
do
know
anything
she
replied
that
she
was
willing
to
wait
just
so
long
as
they
continued
to
correspond
she
said
that
she
could
no
longer
bear
not
to
hear
from
him
so
they
wrote
to
each
other
and
the
tangle
of
their
relations
became
more
hopelessly
knotted
cynthia
never
sent
another
letter
so
unguarded
as
her
first
but
she
made
no
pretense
of
hiding
her
love
as
hugh
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
bog
of
confusion
and
distress
his
contempt
for
his
college
education
increased
one
night
in
may
he
expressed
that
contempt
to
a
small
group
of
seniors
college
is
bunk
said
hugh
sternly
pure
bunk
they
tell
us
that
we
learn
to
think
rot
i
have
learned
to
think
a
child
can
solve
a
simple
human
problem
as
well
as
i
can
college
has
played
hell
with
me
i
came
here
four
years
ago
a
darned
nice
kid
if
i
do
say
so
myself
i
was
of
ideals
and
illusions
well
college
has
smashed
most
of
those
ideals
and
knocked
the
illusions
plumb
to
hell
i
thought
for
example
that
all
college
men
were
gentlemen
well
most
of
them
are
i
thought
that
all
of
them
were
intelligent
and
hard
students
the
group
broke
into
loud
laughter
me
too
said
george
winsor
when
the
noise
had
abated
i
thought
that
i
was
coming
to
a
regular
educational
heaven
halls
of
learning
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
why
it
a
farce
here
i
am
sporting
a
phi
bete
key
an
honor
student
if
you
please
and
all
that
i
really
know
as
a
result
of
my
college
is
the
fine
points
of
football
and
how
to
play
poker
i
do
really
know
one
damn
thing
about
anything
the
other
men
were
jack
lawrence
and
pudge
jamieson
jack
was
an
earnest
chap
serious
and
hard
working
but
without
a
trace
of
brilliance
he
too
wore
a
phi
beta
kappa
key
and
so
did
pudge
hugh
was
the
only
one
of
the
group
who
had
not
won
that
honor
the
fact
that
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
won
a
letter
was
hardly
he
felt
complete
justification
his
legs
no
longer
seemed
more
important
than
his
brains
in
fact
when
he
had
sprained
a
tendon
and
been
forced
to
drop
track
he
had
been
genuinely
pleased
pudge
was
quite
as
plump
as
he
had
been
as
a
freshman
and
quite
as
jovial
but
he
did
not
tell
so
many
smutty
stories
he
still
persisted
in
crossing
his
knees
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
involved
when
winsor
finished
speaking
pudge
forced
his
legs
into
his
favorite
position
for
them
and
then
twinkled
at
winsor
through
his
glasses
right
you
are
george
he
said
in
his
quick
way
i
wear
a
phi
bete
key
too
we
both
belong
to
the
world
greatest
intellectual
fraternity
but
what
in
hell
do
we
know
we
all
majored
in
english
except
jack
and
i
bet
any
one
of
us
can
give
the
others
an
exam
offhand
that
they
ca
pass
i
going
to
law
school
i
hope
to
god
that
i
learn
something
there
i
certainly
do
feel
that
i
know
anything
now
as
a
result
of
my
four
years
of
education
well
if
you
fellows
feel
that
way
said
hugh
mournfully
how
do
you
suppose
i
feel
i
made
my
first
really
good
record
last
term
and
that
was
any
world
beater
i
learned
how
to
gamble
and
smoke
and
drink
and
pet
in
college
but
that
about
all
that
i
have
learned
i
not
as
fine
as
i
was
when
i
came
here
i
been
coarsened
and
cheapened
all
of
us
have
i
take
things
for
granted
that
shocked
me
horribly
once
i
know
that
they
ought
to
shock
me
now
but
they
do
i
made
some
friends
and
i
had
a
wonderful
time
but
i
certainly
do
feel
that
i
have
got
any
other
value
out
of
college
winsor
could
not
sit
still
and
talk
he
filled
his
pipe
viciously
lighted
it
and
then
jumped
up
and
leaned
against
the
mantel
i
admit
everything
that
been
said
but
i
do
believe
that
it
is
altogether
our
fault
he
was
intensely
in
earnest
and
so
were
his
listeners
look
at
the
faculty
when
i
came
here
i
thought
that
they
were
all
wise
men
because
they
were
on
the
faculty
well
i
found
out
otherwise
some
of
them
know
a
lot
and
ca
teach
a
few
of
them
know
a
lot
and
can
teach
some
of
them
know
a
little
and
ca
teach
and
some
of
them
do
know
anything
and
ca
explain
why
look
at
kempton
that
freshman
larson
showed
me
a
theme
the
other
day
that
kempton
had
corrected
it
was
full
of
errors
that
were
marked
and
it
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
drip
even
larson
knew
that
but
he
the
foxy
kid
he
wrote
the
theme
about
kempton
all
right
kempton
gives
him
a
b
and
tells
him
that
it
is
very
amusing
hell
of
a
lot
larson
learning
look
at
kane
in
math
i
had
him
when
i
was
a
freshman
me
too
hugh
chimed
in
said
then
math
dry
enough
god
knows
but
kane
makes
it
dryer
he
a
born
desiccator
he
could
make
as
dry
as
calculus
said
pudge
but
mitchell
could
make
calculus
as
exciting
as
it
and
they
fired
mitchell
jack
lawrence
spoke
for
the
first
time
i
have
that
straight
the
administration
seems
afraid
of
a
man
that
can
teach
they
made
buchanan
a
full
professor
and
there
is
a
man
in
college
who
can
tell
what
he
talking
about
he
written
a
couple
of
books
that
nobody
reads
and
that
makes
him
a
scholar
i
was
forced
to
take
three
courses
with
him
they
were
agony
and
he
never
taught
me
a
damn
thing
most
of
them
do
teach
you
a
damn
thing
winsor
exclaimed
tapping
his
pipe
on
the
mantel
they
either
tell
you
something
that
you
can
find
more
easily
in
a
book
or
just
confuse
you
with
a
lot
of
ponderous
lectures
that
put
you
to
sleep
or
drive
you
crazy
if
you
try
to
understand
them
there
are
just
about
a
dozen
men
in
this
college
worth
listening
to
hugh
put
in
and
i
got
three
of
them
this
term
i
learning
more
than
i
did
in
my
whole
three
first
years
let
be
fair
though
blaming
it
all
on
the
profs
and
you
know
damn
well
that
we
do
study
all
we
try
to
do
is
to
get
by
i
do
mean
you
phi
betes
i
mean
all
the
rest
of
us
and
if
we
can
put
anything
over
on
the
profs
we
are
tickled
pink
we
like
a
lot
of
little
kids
in
just
look
at
the
cheating
that
goes
on
the
copying
of
themes
and
the
cribbing
it
rotten
winsor
started
to
protest
but
hugh
rushed
on
oh
i
know
that
the
majority
of
the
fellows
do
consciously
cheat
i
talking
about
the
copying
of
math
problems
and
the
using
of
trots
and
the
paraphrasing
of
digest
articles
for
themes
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
if
more
than
half
of
the
fellows
do
do
that
sort
of
thing
some
time
or
other
in
college
i
eat
my
hat
and
we
all
know
darned
well
that
we
are
supposed
to
do
it
but
the
majority
of
fellows
cheat
in
some
way
or
other
before
they
graduate
we
are
so
much
do
you
remember
george
what
jimmie
henley
said
to
us
when
we
were
sophomores
in
english
he
laid
us
out
cold
said
that
we
were
as
standardized
as
fords
and
that
we
were
ashamed
of
anything
intellectual
well
he
was
right
do
you
remember
how
he
ended
by
saying
that
if
we
were
the
cream
of
the
earth
he
felt
sorry
for
the
skimmed
milk
or
something
like
that
sure
remember
winsor
replied
running
his
fingers
through
his
rusty
hair
he
certainly
pulled
a
heavy
line
that
day
he
was
right
too
i
tell
you
what
exclaimed
pudge
suddenly
so
suddenly
that
his
crossed
legs
parted
company
and
his
foot
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
let
put
it
up
to
henley
in
class
let
ask
him
straight
out
if
he
thinks
college
is
worth
while
he
hedge
objected
lawrence
all
the
profs
do
if
you
ask
them
anything
like
that
winsor
laughed
you
do
know
jimmie
henley
he
wo
hedge
you
never
had
a
class
with
him
but
hugh
and
pudge
and
i
are
all
in
english
and
we
put
it
up
to
him
he
tell
us
what
he
thinks
all
right
and
i
hope
to
god
that
he
says
it
is
worth
while
i
like
to
have
somebody
convince
me
that
i
got
something
out
of
these
four
years
beside
lower
ideals
hell
sometimes
i
think
that
we
all
damn
fools
we
worship
athletics
no
offense
hugh
above
everything
else
we
gamble
and
drink
and
talk
like
bums
and
about
every
so
often
some
fellow
has
to
go
home
because
a
lovely
lady
has
left
him
with
bitter
bitter
memories
i
with
henley
if
we
the
cream
of
the
earth
well
thank
the
lord
we
not
who
is
lawrence
asked
earnestly
god
knows
chapter
xxv
english
had
only
a
dozen
men
in
it
so
henley
conducted
the
course
in
a
very
informal
fashion
the
men
felt
free
to
bring
up
for
discussion
any
topic
that
interested
them
nobody
was
surprised
therefore
when
george
winsor
asked
henley
to
express
his
opinion
of
the
value
of
a
college
education
he
reminded
henley
of
what
he
had
said
two
years
before
and
rapidly
gave
a
resumé
of
the
discussion
that
resulted
in
the
question
he
was
asking
like
to
know
too
he
concluded
grinning
wickedly
just
whom
you
consider
the
cream
of
the
earth
you
remember
you
said
that
if
we
were
you
felt
sorry
for
the
skimmed
milk
henley
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
yes
he
said
i
remember
saying
that
i
did
think
though
that
you
would
remember
it
for
two
years
you
seem
to
remember
most
of
what
i
said
i
am
truly
astonished
he
grinned
back
at
winsor
the
swine
seem
to
have
eaten
the
pearls
the
class
laughed
but
winsor
was
not
one
to
refuse
the
gambit
they
were
very
indigestible
he
said
quickly
good
henley
exclaimed
i
wanted
them
to
give
you
a
and
i
am
delighted
that
you
still
suffer
we
do
pudge
jamieson
admitted
but
we
like
to
have
a
little
mercy
shown
to
us
now
we
spent
four
years
here
and
while
we
enjoyed
them
we
just
about
made
up
our
minds
that
they
have
been
all
in
all
wasted
years
no
henley
was
decisive
his
playful
manner
entirely
disappeared
no
not
wasted
you
have
enjoyed
them
you
say
splendid
justification
you
will
continue
to
enjoy
them
as
the
years
grow
between
you
and
your
college
days
all
men
are
sentimental
about
college
and
in
that
sentimentality
there
is
continuous
pleasure
your
doubt
delights
me
your
feeling
that
you
have
learned
anything
delights
me
too
it
proves
that
you
have
learned
a
great
deal
it
is
only
the
ignoramus
who
thinks
he
is
wise
the
wise
man
knows
that
he
is
an
ignoramus
that
a
platitude
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
i
have
cold
comfort
for
you
the
more
you
learn
the
less
confident
you
will
be
of
your
own
learning
the
more
utterly
ignorant
you
will
feel
i
have
never
known
so
much
as
the
day
i
graduated
from
high
school
i
held
my
diploma
and
the
knowledge
of
the
ages
in
my
hand
i
had
never
heard
of
socrates
but
i
would
have
challenged
him
to
a
debate
without
the
slightest
fear
since
then
i
have
grown
more
humble
so
humble
that
there
are
times
when
i
am
ashamed
to
come
into
the
what
right
have
i
to
teach
anybody
anything
i
mean
that
quite
sincerely
then
i
remember
that
ignorant
as
i
am
the
undergraduates
are
more
ignorant
i
take
heart
and
mount
the
rostrum
ready
to
speak
with
the
authority
of
a
pundit
he
realized
that
he
was
sliding
off
on
a
tangent
and
paused
to
find
a
new
attack
pudge
jamieson
helped
him
i
suppose
that
all
true
he
said
but
it
does
explain
why
college
is
really
worth
while
the
fact
remains
that
most
of
us
learn
anything
that
we
are
coarsened
by
college
and
that
we
well
we
worship
false
gods
henley
nodded
in
agreement
it
would
be
hard
to
deny
your
assertions
he
acknowledged
and
i
do
think
that
i
am
going
to
try
to
deny
them
of
course
men
grow
coarser
while
they
are
in
college
but
that
mean
that
they
would
grow
coarser
if
they
were
in
college
it
is
college
that
coarsens
a
man
and
destroys
his
illusions
it
is
life
do
think
that
you
can
grow
to
manhood
and
retain
your
pretty
dreams
you
have
become
disillusioned
about
college
in
the
next
few
years
you
will
suffer
further
disillusionment
that
is
the
price
of
living
every
intelligent
man
with
ideals
eventually
becomes
a
cynic
it
is
inevitable
he
has
standards
and
granted
that
he
is
intelligent
he
can
not
fail
to
see
how
far
mankind
falls
below
those
standards
the
result
is
cynicism
and
if
he
is
truly
intelligent
the
cynicism
is
kindly
having
learned
that
man
is
frail
he
expects
little
of
him
therefore
if
he
judges
at
all
his
judgment
is
tempered
either
with
humor
or
with
mercy
the
dozen
boys
were
sprawled
lazily
in
their
chairs
their
feet
resting
on
the
rungs
of
the
chairs
before
them
but
their
eyes
were
fastened
keenly
on
henley
all
that
he
was
saying
was
of
the
greatest
importance
to
them
they
found
comfort
in
his
words
but
the
comfort
raised
new
doubts
new
problems
how
does
that
affect
college
winsor
asked
it
affects
it
very
decidedly
henley
replied
you
have
become
true
cynics
yet
you
expect
too
much
of
college
you
forget
that
the
men
who
run
the
college
and
the
men
who
attend
it
are
at
best
human
beings
and
that
means
that
very
much
can
not
be
expected
of
them
you
do
worship
false
gods
i
find
hope
in
the
fact
that
you
recognize
the
stuff
of
which
your
gods
are
made
i
have
great
hopes
for
the
american
colleges
not
because
i
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
faculties
will
become
wiser
or
that
the
administrations
will
lead
the
students
to
true
gods
not
at
all
but
i
do
think
that
the
students
themselves
will
find
a
way
they
have
already
abandoned
mammon
at
least
the
most
intelligent
have
and
i
begin
to
see
signs
of
less
adoration
for
athletics
athletics
of
course
have
their
place
and
some
of
the
students
are
beginning
to
find
that
place
certainly
the
alumni
have
and
i
do
believe
that
the
administrative
officers
have
either
just
so
long
as
athletes
advertise
the
college
the
administrations
will
coddle
them
the
undergraduates
however
show
signs
of
frowning
on
professionalism
and
the
stupid
athlete
is
rapidly
losing
his
prestige
an
athlete
has
to
show
something
more
than
brawn
to
be
a
hero
among
his
fellows
nowadays
he
paused
and
pudge
spoke
up
perhaps
you
are
right
he
said
but
i
doubt
it
athletics
are
certainly
far
more
important
to
us
than
anything
else
and
the
captain
of
the
football
team
is
always
the
biggest
man
in
college
but
i
do
care
particularly
about
that
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
the
colleges
justify
their
existence
i
do
see
that
you
have
proved
that
they
do
no
i
have
henley
admitted
and
i
do
know
that
i
can
prove
it
of
course
the
colleges
are
perfect
not
by
a
long
way
but
as
human
institutions
go
i
think
they
justify
their
existence
the
four
years
spent
at
college
by
an
intelligent
boy
please
notice
that
i
say
intelligent
are
well
spent
indeed
they
are
gloriously
worth
while
you
said
that
you
have
had
a
wonderful
time
not
so
wonderful
as
you
think
it
is
a
strange
feeling
that
we
have
about
our
college
years
we
all
believe
that
they
are
years
of
unalloyed
happiness
and
the
further
we
leave
them
behind
the
more
perfect
they
seem
as
a
matter
of
fact
few
undergraduates
are
truly
happy
they
are
going
through
a
period
of
storm
and
stress
they
are
torn
by
show
me
a
boy
who
is
perfectly
happy
and
you
show
me
an
idiot
i
rarely
get
a
cheerful
theme
except
from
freshmen
nine
tenths
of
them
are
expressions
of
deep
concern
and
distress
a
boy
college
years
are
the
years
when
he
finds
out
that
life
is
what
he
thought
it
and
the
finding
out
is
a
painful
experience
he
discovers
that
he
and
his
fellows
are
made
of
very
brittle
clay
usually
he
loathes
himself
often
he
loathes
his
fellows
college
is
the
elysium
that
it
is
painted
in
stories
and
novels
but
i
feel
sorry
for
any
intelligent
man
who
did
have
the
opportunity
to
go
to
college
there
is
something
beautiful
about
one
college
days
something
that
one
treasures
all
his
life
as
we
grow
older
we
forget
the
hours
of
storm
and
stress
the
humiliations
the
terror
of
examinations
the
awful
periods
of
doubt
of
god
and
man
we
forget
everything
but
athletic
victories
long
discussions
with
friends
campus
sings
fraternity
life
moonlight
on
the
campus
and
everything
that
is
romantic
the
sting
dies
and
the
beauty
remains
why
do
men
give
large
sums
of
money
to
their
colleges
when
asked
because
they
want
to
help
society
not
at
all
the
average
man
even
take
that
into
consideration
he
gives
the
money
because
he
loves
his
alma
mater
because
he
has
beautiful
and
tender
memories
of
her
no
colleges
are
far
from
perfect
tragically
far
from
it
but
any
institution
that
commands
loyalty
and
love
as
colleges
do
can
not
be
wholly
imperfect
there
is
a
virtue
in
a
college
that
uninspired
administrative
officers
stupid
professors
and
alumni
with
false
ideals
can
not
kill
at
times
i
tremble
for
sanford
college
there
are
times
when
i
swear
at
it
but
i
never
cease
to
love
it
if
you
feel
that
way
about
college
why
did
you
say
those
things
to
us
two
years
ago
hugh
asked
because
they
were
true
all
true
i
was
talking
about
the
undergraduates
then
and
i
could
have
said
much
more
cutting
things
and
still
been
on
the
safe
side
of
the
truth
there
is
however
another
side
and
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
give
you
now
rather
incoherently
i
know
hugh
thought
of
cynthia
i
suppose
all
that
you
say
is
true
he
admitted
dubiously
but
i
ca
feel
that
college
does
what
it
should
for
us
we
are
told
that
we
are
taught
to
think
but
the
minute
we
bump
up
against
a
problem
in
living
we
are
stumped
just
as
badly
as
we
were
when
we
are
freshmen
oh
no
not
at
all
you
solve
problems
every
day
that
would
have
stumped
you
hopelessly
as
a
freshman
you
think
better
than
you
did
four
years
ago
but
no
college
however
perfect
can
teach
you
all
the
solutions
of
life
there
are
no
nostrums
or
that
the
colleges
can
give
for
all
the
ills
and
sicknesses
of
life
you
i
am
afraid
will
have
to
doctor
those
yourself
i
see
hugh
did
altogether
see
both
college
and
life
seemed
more
complicated
than
he
had
thought
them
i
am
curious
to
know
he
added
just
whom
you
consider
the
cream
of
the
earth
that
expression
has
stuck
in
my
mind
i
do
know
why
but
it
has
henley
smiled
probably
because
it
is
such
a
very
badly
mixed
metaphor
well
i
consider
the
college
man
the
cream
of
the
earth
what
four
of
the
men
exclaimed
and
all
of
them
sat
suddenly
upright
yes
but
let
me
explain
if
i
remember
rightly
i
said
that
if
you
were
the
cream
of
the
earth
i
hoped
that
god
would
pity
the
skimmed
milk
well
everything
taken
into
consideration
i
do
think
that
you
are
the
cream
of
the
earth
and
i
have
no
hope
for
the
skimmed
milk
perhaps
it
is
wise
for
me
to
give
public
expression
to
my
pessimism
but
you
ought
to
be
old
enough
to
stand
it
the
average
college
graduate
is
a
pretty
poor
specimen
but
all
in
all
he
is
just
about
the
best
we
have
please
remember
that
i
am
talking
in
averages
i
know
perfectly
well
that
a
great
many
brilliant
men
do
not
come
to
college
and
that
a
great
many
stupid
men
do
come
but
the
colleges
get
a
very
fair
percentage
of
the
intelligent
ones
and
a
comparatively
small
percentage
of
the
stupid
ones
in
other
words
to
play
with
my
mixed
metaphor
a
bit
the
cream
is
very
thin
in
places
and
the
skimmed
milk
has
some
very
thick
clots
of
cream
but
in
the
end
the
cream
remains
the
cream
and
the
milk
the
milk
everything
taken
into
consideration
we
get
in
the
colleges
the
young
men
with
the
highest
ideals
the
loftiest
purpose
you
want
to
tell
me
that
those
ideals
are
low
and
the
purpose
materialistic
and
selfish
i
know
it
but
the
average
college
graduate
i
repeat
has
loftier
ideals
and
is
less
materialistic
than
the
average
man
who
has
not
gone
to
college
i
wish
that
i
could
believe
that
the
college
gives
him
those
ideals
i
ca
however
the
colleges
draw
the
best
that
society
has
to
offer
therefore
they
graduate
the
best
oh
i
do
know
a
student
interrupted
how
about
edison
and
ford
and
and
shakspere
and
sophocles
henley
concluded
for
him
edison
is
an
inventive
genius
and
ford
is
a
business
genius
genius
has
anything
to
do
with
schools
the
colleges
however
could
have
made
both
ford
and
edison
bigger
men
though
they
could
have
made
them
lesser
geniuses
no
we
must
not
take
the
exceptional
man
as
a
standard
we
got
to
talk
about
the
average
the
hand
of
the
potter
shook
badly
when
he
made
man
it
was
at
best
a
careless
job
but
he
made
some
better
than
others
some
a
little
less
weak
a
little
more
intelligent
all
in
all
those
are
the
men
that
come
to
college
the
colleges
ought
to
do
a
thousand
times
more
for
those
men
than
they
do
do
but
after
all
they
do
something
for
them
and
i
am
optimistic
enough
to
believe
that
the
time
will
come
when
they
will
do
more
some
day
perhaps
he
concluded
very
seriously
our
administrative
officers
will
be
true
educators
some
day
perhaps
our
faculties
will
be
wise
men
really
fitted
to
teach
some
day
perhaps
our
students
will
be
really
students
eager
to
learn
honest
searchers
after
beauty
and
truth
that
day
will
be
the
millennium
i
look
for
the
undergraduates
to
lead
us
to
it
chapter
xxvi
the
college
year
swept
rapidly
to
its
close
so
rapidly
to
the
seniors
that
the
days
seemed
to
melt
in
their
grasp
the
twentieth
of
june
would
bring
them
their
diplomas
and
the
end
of
their
college
life
they
felt
a
bit
chesty
at
the
thought
of
that
or
but
a
little
sentimental
at
the
thought
of
leaving
old
sanford
suddenly
everything
about
the
college
became
infinitely
precious
every
tradition
every
building
no
matter
how
ugly
even
the
professors
not
just
the
deserving
few
all
of
them
hugh
took
to
wandering
about
the
campus
sometimes
alone
thinking
of
cynthia
sometimes
with
a
favored
crony
such
as
george
winsor
or
pudge
jamieson
he
did
see
very
much
of
norry
the
last
month
or
two
of
college
he
was
just
as
fond
of
him
as
ever
but
norry
was
only
a
junior
he
would
not
understand
how
a
fellow
felt
about
sanford
when
he
was
on
the
verge
of
leaving
her
but
george
and
pudge
did
understand
the
boys
did
say
much
as
they
wandered
around
the
buildings
merely
strolled
along
occasionally
pausing
to
laugh
over
some
experience
that
had
happened
to
one
of
them
in
the
building
they
were
passing
hugh
could
never
pass
surrey
hall
without
feeling
something
deeper
than
sentimentality
he
always
thought
of
carl
peters
from
whom
he
had
not
heard
for
more
than
a
year
he
understood
carl
better
now
his
desire
to
be
a
gentleman
and
his
despair
at
ever
succeeding
surrey
hall
held
drama
for
hugh
not
all
of
it
pleasant
but
he
had
a
deeper
affection
for
the
dormitory
then
he
would
ever
have
for
the
nu
delta
house
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
morse
the
homesick
freshman
poor
morse
and
the
bull
sessions
he
had
sat
in
in
old
surrey
he
had
learned
a
lot
from
them
a
whole
lot
the
chapel
where
he
had
slept
and
surreptitiously
eaten
doughnuts
and
read
the
sanford
news
suddenly
became
a
holy
building
the
building
that
housed
the
soul
of
sanford
he
knew
that
he
was
sentimental
that
he
was
investing
buildings
with
a
greater
significance
than
they
had
in
their
own
right
but
he
continued
to
dream
over
the
last
four
years
and
to
find
a
melancholy
beauty
in
his
own
sentimentality
if
it
been
for
cynthia
he
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
soon
the
examinations
were
over
and
the
underclassmen
began
to
depart
to
all
his
friends
who
were
not
seniors
to
norry
parker
thanks
for
the
congratulations
old
man
sorry
i
visit
you
this
summer
ca
you
spend
a
month
with
me
on
the
farm
to
his
fraternity
brothers
except
the
few
left
in
his
own
delegation
old
man
sure
i
see
you
next
year
at
the
reunion
sad
this
business
of
saying
damn
sad
gee
how
a
fellow
would
miss
all
the
good
old
eggs
he
had
walked
with
and
drunk
with
and
bulled
with
these
past
years
good
eggs
all
of
them
damn
good
eggs
god
a
fellow
could
appreciate
college
until
he
was
about
to
leave
it
oh
for
a
chance
to
live
those
four
years
over
again
would
i
live
them
differently
i
say
i
would
boyhood
commencement
was
coming
hugh
had
thought
before
of
what
that
word
meant
commencement
the
beginning
what
was
he
going
to
do
with
this
commencement
of
his
into
life
old
pudge
was
going
to
law
school
and
so
was
jack
lawrence
george
winsor
was
going
to
medical
school
but
what
was
he
going
to
do
he
felt
so
pathetically
unprepared
and
then
there
was
cynthia
what
was
he
going
to
do
about
her
she
rarely
left
his
mind
how
could
he
tackle
life
when
he
could
solve
the
problem
she
presented
it
was
like
trying
to
run
a
hundred
against
fast
men
when
a
fellow
had
only
begun
to
train
henley
had
advised
him
to
take
a
year
or
so
at
harvard
if
his
father
proved
willing
and
his
father
was
more
than
willing
even
eager
he
guessed
that
he
take
at
least
a
year
in
cambridge
perhaps
he
could
find
himself
in
that
year
maybe
he
could
learn
to
write
he
hoped
to
god
he
could
just
before
commencement
his
relations
with
cynthia
came
to
a
climax
they
had
been
constantly
becoming
more
complicated
she
was
demanding
nothing
of
him
but
her
letters
were
tinged
with
despair
he
felt
at
last
that
he
must
see
her
then
he
would
know
whether
he
loved
her
or
not
a
year
before
she
had
said
that
he
did
how
did
she
know
she
had
said
that
all
he
felt
for
her
was
sex
attraction
how
did
she
know
that
why
she
had
said
that
was
all
that
she
felt
for
him
and
he
had
heard
plenty
of
fellows
argue
that
love
was
nothing
but
sexual
attraction
anyway
and
that
all
the
stuff
the
poets
wrote
was
pure
bunk
freud
said
something
like
that
he
thought
and
freud
knew
a
damn
sight
more
about
it
than
the
poets
yet
the
doubt
remained
whether
love
was
merely
sexual
attraction
or
not
he
wanted
something
more
than
that
his
every
instinct
demanded
something
more
he
had
noticed
another
thing
the
fellows
that
engaged
said
that
love
was
only
sexual
attraction
those
who
were
engaged
vehemently
denied
it
and
hugh
knew
that
some
of
the
engaged
men
had
led
gay
lives
in
college
he
could
not
reach
any
decision
at
times
he
was
sure
that
what
he
felt
for
cynthia
was
love
at
other
times
he
was
sure
that
it
was
at
last
in
desperation
he
telegraphed
to
her
that
he
was
coming
to
new
york
and
that
she
should
meet
him
at
grand
central
at
three
the
next
day
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
go
he
would
be
able
to
stay
in
new
york
only
a
little
more
than
two
hours
because
his
father
and
mother
would
arrive
in
haydensville
the
day
following
and
he
felt
that
he
had
to
be
there
to
greet
them
he
damned
himself
for
his
impetuousness
all
during
the
long
trip
and
a
dozen
times
he
wished
he
were
back
safe
in
the
nu
delta
house
what
in
hell
would
he
say
to
cynthia
anyway
what
would
he
do
when
he
saw
her
kiss
her
i
wo
have
a
damned
bit
of
sense
left
if
i
do
she
was
waiting
for
him
as
he
came
through
the
gate
quite
without
thinking
he
put
down
his
bag
and
kissed
her
her
touch
had
its
old
power
his
blood
leaped
with
a
tremendous
effort
of
will
he
controlled
himself
that
afternoon
was
he
must
keep
his
head
it
sweet
of
you
to
come
cynthia
whispered
clinging
to
him
so
damned
sweet
it
damned
good
to
see
you
he
replied
gruffly
come
on
while
i
check
this
bag
i
only
got
a
little
over
two
hours
cynthia
got
to
get
the
back
my
folks
will
be
in
haydensville
morning
and
i
got
to
get
back
to
meet
them
her
face
clouded
for
an
instant
but
she
tucked
her
arm
gaily
in
his
and
marched
with
him
across
the
rotunda
to
the
checking
counter
when
hugh
had
disposed
of
his
bag
he
suggested
that
they
go
to
a
little
tea
room
on
street
she
agreed
without
argument
once
they
were
in
a
taxi
she
wanted
to
snuggle
down
into
his
arm
but
she
restrained
herself
she
felt
that
she
had
to
play
fair
hugh
said
nothing
he
was
trying
to
think
and
his
thoughts
whirled
around
in
a
mad
drunken
dance
he
believed
that
he
would
be
married
before
he
took
the
train
back
at
least
engaged
and
what
would
all
that
mean
did
he
want
to
get
married
god
he
did
know
when
at
last
they
were
settled
in
a
corner
of
the
empty
and
had
given
their
order
they
talked
in
an
embarrassed
fashion
about
their
recent
letters
both
of
them
carefully
quiet
and
restrained
finally
hugh
shoved
his
plate
and
cup
aside
and
looked
straight
at
her
for
the
first
time
she
was
thin
much
thinner
than
she
had
been
a
year
ago
but
there
was
something
sweeter
about
her
too
she
seemed
so
quiet
so
gentle
we
are
going
to
get
anywhere
this
way
cynthia
he
said
desperately
we
both
evading
i
have
any
sense
left
but
what
i
say
from
now
on
i
am
going
to
say
straight
out
i
swore
on
the
train
that
i
would
kiss
you
i
knew
that
i
would
be
able
to
think
if
i
did
and
i
ca
all
i
know
is
that
i
want
to
kiss
you
again
he
looked
at
her
sitting
across
the
little
table
from
him
so
slender
and
still
a
different
cynthia
but
damnably
desirable
cynthia
he
added
hoarsely
if
you
took
my
hand
you
could
lead
me
to
hell
she
in
turn
looked
at
him
he
was
much
older
than
he
had
been
a
year
before
then
he
had
been
a
boy
now
he
seemed
a
man
he
had
not
changed
particularly
he
was
as
blond
and
young
and
clean
as
ever
but
there
was
something
about
his
mouth
and
eyes
something
more
serious
and
more
stern
that
made
him
seem
years
older
i
do
want
to
lead
you
to
hell
honey
she
replied
softly
i
left
prom
last
year
so
that
i
would
do
that
i
told
you
then
that
i
good
for
you
but
i
different
now
i
can
see
that
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
you
different
awfully
different
he
leaned
forward
suddenly
cynthia
shall
we
go
over
to
jersey
and
get
married
i
understand
that
one
can
there
right
away
we
both
of
age
wait
hugh
wait
cynthia
hands
were
tightly
clasped
in
her
lap
are
you
sure
that
you
want
to
i
been
thinking
a
lot
since
i
got
your
telegram
are
you
sure
you
love
me
he
slumped
back
into
his
chair
i
do
know
what
love
is
he
confessed
miserably
i
ca
find
out
cynthia
hands
tightened
in
her
lap
i
tried
to
think
this
business
out
and
i
ca
i
any
right
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
have
any
money
not
a
bit
and
i
not
prepared
to
do
anything
either
as
i
wrote
you
my
folks
want
me
to
go
to
harvard
next
year
the
mention
of
his
poverty
and
of
his
inability
to
support
a
wife
brought
him
back
to
something
approaching
normal
again
i
suppose
i
just
a
kid
cynthia
he
added
more
quietly
but
sometimes
i
feel
a
thousand
years
old
i
do
right
now
what
were
your
plans
for
next
year
and
after
that
until
you
saw
me
her
eyes
searched
his
oh
i
thought
i
go
to
harvard
a
year
or
two
and
then
try
to
write
or
perhaps
teach
writing
is
slow
business
i
understand
and
teaching
does
pay
anything
i
do
want
to
ask
my
father
to
support
us
and
i
wo
let
your
folks
i
lost
my
head
when
i
suggested
that
we
get
married
it
would
be
foolish
i
have
the
right
no
she
agreed
slowly
no
neither
of
us
has
the
right
i
thought
before
you
came
if
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
i
was
sure
somehow
that
you
would
i
would
run
right
off
and
do
it
but
now
i
know
that
i
wo
she
continued
to
gaze
at
him
her
eyes
troubled
and
confused
what
made
him
seem
so
much
older
so
different
do
you
think
we
can
ever
forget
prom
she
waited
for
his
reply
so
much
depended
on
it
of
course
he
answered
impatiently
i
forgotten
that
already
we
were
crazy
kids
that
all
youngsters
trying
to
act
smart
and
wild
oh
the
ejaculation
was
soft
but
it
vibrated
with
pain
you
mean
that
that
you
would
well
you
would
get
drunk
like
that
again
of
course
not
especially
at
a
dance
i
not
a
child
any
longer
cynthia
i
have
sense
enough
now
not
to
forfeit
my
again
i
hope
so
anyway
i
have
been
drunk
in
the
last
year
a
drunkard
is
a
beastly
sight
rotten
if
i
have
learned
anything
in
college
it
is
that
a
man
has
to
respect
himself
and
i
ca
respect
any
one
any
longer
who
deliberately
reduces
himself
to
a
beast
i
was
a
beast
with
you
a
year
ago
i
treated
you
like
a
woman
of
the
streets
and
i
abused
norry
parker
hospitality
shamefully
if
i
can
help
it
i
never
act
like
a
rotter
again
i
hate
a
prig
cynthia
like
the
devil
but
i
hate
a
rotter
even
more
i
hope
i
can
learn
to
be
neither
as
he
spoke
cynthia
clenched
her
hands
so
tightly
that
the
were
bruising
her
tender
palms
but
her
eyes
remained
dry
and
her
lips
did
not
tremble
if
he
could
have
seen
on
some
parties
this
last
year
you
have
changed
a
lot
her
words
were
barely
audible
you
have
changed
an
awful
lot
he
smiled
i
hope
so
there
are
times
now
when
i
hate
myself
but
i
never
hate
myself
so
much
as
when
i
think
of
prom
i
learned
a
lot
in
the
last
year
and
i
hope
i
learned
enough
to
treat
a
decent
girl
decently
i
have
never
apologized
to
you
the
way
i
think
i
ought
to
do
she
cried
her
voice
vibrant
with
pain
do
i
was
more
to
blame
than
you
were
let
not
talk
about
that
all
right
i
more
than
willing
to
forget
it
he
paused
and
then
continued
very
seriously
i
ca
ask
you
to
marry
me
now
cynthia
but
but
are
you
willing
to
wait
for
me
it
may
take
time
but
i
promise
i
work
hard
cynthia
hands
clenched
convulsively
no
hugh
honey
she
whispered
i
never
marry
you
i
i
do
love
you
what
he
demanded
his
senses
swimming
in
hopeless
confusion
what
she
did
not
say
that
she
knew
that
he
did
not
love
her
she
did
not
tell
him
how
much
his
quixotic
chivalry
moved
her
nor
did
she
tell
him
that
she
knew
only
too
well
that
she
could
lead
him
to
hell
as
he
said
but
that
that
was
the
only
place
that
she
could
lead
him
these
things
she
felt
positive
of
but
to
mention
them
meant
an
argument
and
an
argument
would
have
been
unendurable
no
she
repeated
i
do
love
you
you
see
you
so
different
from
what
i
remembered
you
grown
up
and
you
changed
why
hugh
strangers
i
realized
that
while
you
been
talking
we
do
know
each
other
not
a
bit
we
only
saw
each
other
for
a
week
summer
before
last
and
for
two
days
last
spring
now
we
two
altogether
different
people
and
we
do
know
each
other
at
all
she
prayed
that
he
would
deny
her
statements
that
he
would
say
they
knew
each
other
by
instinct
anything
so
long
as
he
did
not
agree
i
certainly
do
know
you
the
way
you
talking
now
he
said
almost
roughly
his
pride
hurt
and
his
mind
in
a
turmoil
i
know
that
we
know
each
other
but
i
never
thought
that
you
thought
that
mattered
her
hands
clenched
more
tightly
for
an
instant
and
then
lay
open
and
limp
in
her
lap
her
lips
were
trembling
so
she
smiled
i
did
think
it
mattered
until
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
then
i
knew
it
did
it
was
game
of
you
to
offer
to
take
a
chance
but
i
not
that
game
i
could
marry
a
strange
man
i
like
that
man
a
lot
but
i
do
love
him
and
you
want
me
to
marry
you
if
i
do
love
you
do
you
hugh
of
course
not
he
looked
down
in
earnest
thought
and
then
said
softly
his
eyes
on
the
table
i
glad
that
you
feel
that
way
cynthia
she
bit
her
lip
and
trembled
slightly
i
confess
now
that
i
do
think
that
i
love
you
either
you
sweep
me
clean
off
my
feet
when
i
with
you
but
when
i
away
from
you
i
do
feel
that
way
i
think
love
must
be
something
more
than
we
feel
for
each
other
he
looked
up
and
smiled
boyishly
we
go
on
being
friends
anyhow
we
somehow
she
managed
to
smile
back
at
him
of
course
she
whispered
and
then
after
a
brief
pause
added
we
had
better
go
now
your
train
will
be
leaving
pretty
soon
hugh
pulled
out
his
watch
by
jingo
so
it
will
he
called
the
waiter
paid
his
bill
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
turned
into
fifth
avenue
they
had
gone
about
a
block
down
the
avenue
when
hugh
saw
some
one
a
few
feet
ahead
of
him
who
looked
familiar
could
it
be
carl
peters
by
the
lord
harry
it
was
excuse
me
a
minute
cynthia
please
there
a
fellow
i
know
he
rushed
forward
and
caught
carl
by
the
arm
carl
cried
hugh
by
god
and
shook
hands
with
him
violently
hell
hugh
i
glad
to
see
you
hugh
turned
to
cynthia
who
was
a
pace
behind
them
he
introduced
carl
and
cynthia
to
each
other
and
then
asked
carl
why
in
the
devil
he
had
written
carl
switched
his
leg
with
his
cane
and
grinned
you
know
darn
well
hugh
that
i
do
write
letters
but
i
did
mean
to
write
to
you
i
meant
to
often
i
been
traveling
my
mother
and
i
have
just
got
back
from
a
trip
around
the
world
where
are
you
going
now
oh
golly
hugh
exclaimed
i
got
to
hurry
if
i
going
to
make
that
train
come
on
carl
with
us
to
grand
central
i
got
to
get
the
back
to
haydensville
my
folks
are
coming
up
for
commencement
instantly
he
hated
himself
why
did
he
have
to
mention
commencement
he
might
have
remembered
that
it
should
have
been
commencement
too
carl
however
did
not
seem
in
the
least
disturbed
and
he
cheerfully
accompanied
hugh
and
cynthia
to
the
station
he
looked
at
cynthia
and
had
an
idea
have
you
checked
your
bag
yes
hugh
replied
well
give
me
the
check
and
i
get
it
for
you
i
meet
you
at
the
gate
hugh
surrendered
the
check
and
then
proceeded
to
the
gate
with
cynthia
he
turned
to
her
and
asked
gently
may
i
kiss
you
cynthia
for
an
instant
she
looked
down
and
said
nothing
then
she
turned
her
face
up
to
his
he
kissed
her
tenderly
wondering
why
he
felt
no
passion
afraid
that
he
would
cynthia
dear
he
whispered
her
hands
fluttered
helplessly
about
his
coat
lapels
and
then
fell
to
her
side
she
managed
a
brave
little
smile
honey
carl
rushed
up
with
the
bag
gosh
hugh
you
got
to
hurry
closing
the
gate
he
gripped
his
hand
for
a
second
visit
me
at
bar
harbor
this
summer
if
you
can
sure
old
man
cynthia
hugh
slipped
through
the
gate
and
turned
to
wave
at
carl
and
cynthia
they
waved
back
and
then
he
ran
for
the
train
on
the
long
trip
to
haydensville
hugh
relaxed
now
that
the
strain
was
over
he
felt
suddenly
weak
but
it
was
sweet
weakness
he
could
graduate
in
peace
now
the
visit
to
new
york
had
been
worth
while
and
what
do
you
know
bumping
into
old
carl
like
that
i
cynthia
and
he
were
friends
too
the
best
friends
in
the
world
but
she
no
longer
wanted
to
marry
him
that
was
fine
he
remembered
the
picture
she
and
carl
had
made
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
from
him
what
a
peach
of
a
pair
golly
would
it
be
funny
if
they
hit
it
off
he
thought
over
every
word
that
he
and
cynthia
had
said
she
certainly
had
been
square
all
right
not
many
like
her
but
by
heaven
i
knew
down
in
my
heart
all
the
time
that
i
did
want
to
get
married
or
even
engaged
it
would
have
played
hell
with
everything
chapter
xxvii
the
next
morning
hugh
mother
and
father
arrived
in
the
automobile
he
was
to
drive
them
back
to
merrytown
the
day
after
commencement
at
last
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
nu
delta
house
and
welcomed
his
father
but
he
had
forgotten
all
about
that
youthful
dream
he
was
merely
aware
that
he
was
enormously
glad
to
see
the
folks
and
that
his
father
seemed
to
be
withering
into
an
old
man
as
the
departed
the
alumni
began
to
arrive
the
five
year
classes
dressed
in
extraordinary
outfits
indians
turks
and
men
in
prison
garb
roamed
the
campus
there
were
youngsters
just
a
year
out
of
college
still
looking
like
undergraduates
still
full
of
college
talk
the
alumni
ranged
all
the
way
from
these
men
to
the
men
twelve
old
men
who
had
come
back
to
sanford
fifty
years
after
their
graduation
and
two
of
them
had
come
all
the
way
across
the
continent
there
had
been
only
fifty
men
originally
in
that
class
and
twelve
of
them
were
back
what
brought
them
back
hugh
wondered
he
thought
he
knew
but
he
could
have
given
a
reason
he
watched
those
old
men
wandering
slowly
around
the
campus
one
of
them
with
his
grandson
who
was
graduating
this
year
and
he
was
awed
by
their
age
and
their
devotion
to
their
alma
mater
yes
henley
had
been
right
sanford
was
far
from
perfect
far
from
it
a
child
could
see
that
but
there
was
something
in
the
college
that
gripped
one
heart
what
faults
that
old
college
had
but
how
one
loved
her
thousands
of
japanese
lanterns
had
been
strung
around
the
campus
an
electric
fountain
sparkled
and
splashed
its
waters
a
band
seemed
to
be
playing
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
from
the
in
front
of
the
union
it
was
a
gay
scene
and
everybody
seemed
superbly
happy
except
possibly
the
seniors
they
pretended
to
be
happy
but
all
of
them
were
a
little
sad
a
little
frightened
college
had
been
very
beautiful
and
the
world
outside
what
was
it
what
did
it
have
in
store
for
them
there
were
mothers
and
fathers
there
to
see
their
sons
receive
their
degrees
there
were
the
wives
and
children
of
the
alumni
there
were
sisters
and
fiancées
of
the
seniors
nearly
two
thousand
people
and
at
least
half
of
the
alumni
drunk
most
of
the
time
very
drunk
many
of
them
and
very
foolish
but
nobody
minded
somehow
every
one
seemed
to
realize
that
in
a
few
brief
days
they
were
trying
to
recapture
a
youthful
thrill
that
had
gone
forever
some
of
the
drunken
ones
seemed
very
silly
some
of
them
seemed
almost
offensive
all
of
them
were
pathetic
they
had
come
back
to
sanford
where
they
had
once
been
so
young
and
exuberant
so
tireless
in
pleasure
so
in
love
with
living
and
they
were
trying
to
pour
all
that
youthful
zest
into
themselves
again
out
of
a
bottle
bought
from
a
bootlegger
were
they
having
a
good
time
who
knows
probably
not
a
man
does
not
particularly
enjoy
looking
at
a
picture
taken
in
his
hirsute
youth
and
yet
there
is
a
certain
whimsical
pleasure
in
the
memories
the
picture
brings
for
three
days
there
was
much
gaiety
much
singing
of
class
songs
constant
parading
dances
class
circuses
and
endless
shaking
of
hands
and
exchanging
of
reminiscences
the
seniors
moved
through
all
the
excitement
quietly
keeping
close
to
their
relatives
and
friends
graduation
was
so
thrilling
as
they
had
expected
it
to
be
it
was
more
sad
the
alumni
seemed
to
be
having
a
good
time
they
were
ridiculously
boyish
only
the
seniors
were
grave
strangely
and
unnaturally
dignified
most
of
the
alumni
left
the
night
before
the
graduation
exercises
the
parents
and
fiancées
remained
they
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
campus
and
watched
the
seniors
clad
in
caps
and
gowns
line
up
before
the
union
at
the
orders
of
the
class
marshal
finally
the
procession
the
grand
marshal
a
professor
in
the
lead
with
a
wand
in
his
hand
then
president
culver
and
the
governor
of
the
state
then
the
men
who
were
to
receive
honorary
degrees
a
writer
a
college
president
a
philanthropist
a
professor
and
three
politicians
then
the
faculty
in
academic
robes
their
hoods
brilliant
against
their
black
gowns
and
last
the
seniors
a
long
line
of
them
marching
in
twos
headed
by
their
marshal
the
visitors
streamed
after
them
into
the
chapel
the
seniors
sat
in
their
customary
seats
the
faculty
and
the
men
who
were
to
receive
honorary
degrees
on
a
platform
that
had
been
built
at
the
altar
after
they
were
seated
everything
became
a
blur
to
hugh
he
hardly
knew
what
was
happening
he
saw
his
father
and
mother
sitting
in
the
transept
he
thought
his
mother
was
crying
he
hoped
not
some
one
prayed
stupidly
there
was
a
hymn
what
was
it
cynthia
had
said
oh
yes
i
ca
marry
a
stranger
well
they
were
exactly
strangers
he
was
darn
glad
he
had
gone
to
new
york
the
president
seemed
to
be
saying
over
and
over
again
by
the
power
invested
in
me
and
every
time
that
he
said
it
professor
blake
would
slip
the
loop
of
a
colored
hood
over
the
head
of
a
writer
or
a
politician
and
then
it
was
happening
all
over
again
suddenly
the
class
marshal
motioned
to
the
seniors
to
rise
they
put
on
their
the
president
said
once
more
by
the
power
invested
in
me
the
seniors
filed
by
the
president
and
the
grand
marshal
handed
each
of
them
a
roll
of
parchment
tied
with
blue
and
orange
ribbons
hugh
felt
a
strange
thrill
as
he
took
his
he
was
graduated
he
was
a
bachelor
of
science
back
again
to
their
seats
some
one
was
pronouncing
benediction
music
from
the
organ
marching
out
of
the
chapel
the
surge
of
friends
his
father
shaking
his
hand
his
mother
arms
around
his
neck
she
crying
graduation
was
over
and
with
it
hugh
college
days
many
of
the
seniors
left
at
once
hugh
would
have
liked
to
go
too
but
his
father
wanted
to
stay
one
more
day
in
haydensville
besides
there
was
a
final
senior
dance
that
night
and
he
thought
that
hugh
ought
to
attend
it
hugh
did
go
to
the
dance
but
somehow
it
brought
him
no
pleasure
although
it
was
immensely
decorous
it
reminded
him
of
cynthia
he
thought
of
her
tenderly
the
best
little
girl
he
ever
met
he
danced
on
religiously
steering
around
the
sisters
and
fiancées
of
his
friends
but
he
could
not
enjoy
the
dance
shortly
after
eleven
he
slipped
out
of
the
gymnasium
and
made
one
last
tour
of
the
campus
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
the
campus
was
mysterious
with
shadows
the
elms
shook
their
leaves
whisperingly
the
tower
of
the
chapel
looked
like
magic
tracery
in
the
moonlight
he
paused
before
surrey
hall
now
dark
and
empty
good
old
carl
carl
and
cynthia
he
wondered
pudge
had
roomed
there
too
he
passed
on
keller
hall
cynthia
and
norry
god
what
a
beast
i
was
that
night
how
white
norry
was
and
cynthia
too
cynthia
again
she
always
be
a
part
of
sanford
to
him
on
down
to
the
lake
to
watch
the
silver
path
of
the
moonlight
and
the
heavy
reflections
near
the
shore
swimming
canoeing
skating
he
and
cynthia
in
the
woods
beyond
on
back
to
the
campus
around
the
buildings
every
one
of
them
filled
with
memories
four
years
four
beautiful
wonderful
years
good
old
sanford
midnight
struck
some
one
turned
a
switch
somewhere
the
japanese
lanterns
suddenly
lost
their
colors
and
faded
to
gray
balloons
in
the
moonlight
some
men
were
singing
on
the
union
steps
it
was
a
few
seniors
hugh
knew
they
had
been
singing
for
an
hour
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
campus
and
listened
his
eyes
full
of
tears
earnestly
religiously
the
men
sang
their
voices
rich
with
emotion
sanford
sanford
mother
of
men
love
us
guard
us
hold
us
true
let
thy
arms
enfold
us
let
thy
truth
uphold
us
queen
of
colleges
mother
of
men
alma
mater
sanford
hail
hail
hail
hugh
walked
slowly
across
the
campus
toward
the
nu
delta
house
he
was
both
happy
and
sad
happy
because
the
great
adventure
was
before
him
with
all
its
mystery
sad
because
he
was
leaving
something
beautiful
behind
