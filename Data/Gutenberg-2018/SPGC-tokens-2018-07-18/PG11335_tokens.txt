the
einstein
theory
of
relativity
a
concise
statement
by
lorentz
of
the
university
of
leyden
note
whether
it
is
true
or
not
that
not
more
than
twelve
persons
in
all
the
world
are
able
to
understand
einstein
theory
it
is
nevertheless
a
fact
that
there
is
a
constant
demand
for
information
about
this
topic
of
relativity
the
books
published
on
the
subject
are
so
technical
that
only
a
person
trained
in
pure
physics
and
higher
mathematics
is
able
to
fully
understand
them
in
order
to
make
a
popular
explanation
of
this
theory
available
the
present
book
is
published
professor
lorentz
is
credited
by
einstein
with
sharing
the
development
of
his
theory
he
is
doubtless
better
able
than
any
other
man
except
the
author
himself
to
explain
this
scientific
discovery
the
publishers
wish
to
acknowledge
their
indebtedness
to
the
new
york
times
the
review

courteous

originally
in
the
nieuwe
rotterdamsche
courant
of
november
introduction
the
action
of
the
royal
society
at
its
meeting
in
london
on
november
in
recognizing
albert
einstein
theory
of
relativity
has
caused
a
great
stir
in
scientific
circles
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
einstein
propounded
his
theory
nearly
fifteen
years
ago
the
present
revival
of
interest
in
it
is
due
to
the
remarkable
confirmation
which
it
received
in
the
report
of
the
observations
made
during
the
sun
eclipse
of
last
may
to
determine
whether
rays
of
light
passing
close
to
the
sun
are
deflected
from
their
course
the
actual
deflection
of
the
rays
that
was
discovered
by
the
astronomers
was
precisely
what
had
been
predicted
theoretically
by
einstein
many
years
since
this
striking
confirmation
has
led
certain
german
scientists
to
assert
that
no
scientific
discovery
of
such
importance
has
been
made
since
newton
theory
of
gravitation
was
promulgated
this
suggestion
however
was
put
aside
by
einstein
himself
when
he
was
interviewed
by
a
correspondent
of
the
new
york
times
at
his
home
in
berlin
to
this
correspondent
he
expressed
the
difference
between
his
conception
and
the
law
of
gravitation
in
the
following
terms
please
imagine
the
earth
removed
and
in
its
place
suspended
a
box
as
big
as
a
room
or
a
whole
house
and
inside
a
man
naturally
floating
in
the
center
there
being
no
force
whatever
pulling
him
imagine
further
this
box
being
by
a
rope
or
other
contrivance
suddenly
jerked
to
one
side
which
is
scientifically
termed
motion
as
opposed
to
motion
the
person
would
then
naturally
reach
bottom
on
the
opposite
side
the
result
would
consequently
be
the
same
as
if
he
obeyed
newton
law
of
gravitation
while
in
fact
there
is
no
gravitation
exerted
whatever
which
proves
that
difform
motion
will
in
every
case
produce
the
same
effects
as
gravitation
i
have
applied
this
new
idea
to
every
kind
of
difform
motion
and
have
thus
developed
mathematical
formulas
which
i
am
convinced
give
more
precise
results
than
those
based
on
newton
theory
formulas
however
are
such
close
approximations
that
it
was
difficult
to
find
by
observation
any
obvious
disagreement
with
experience
einstein
it
must
be
remembered
is
a
physicist
and
not
an
astronomer
he
developed
his
theory
as
a
mathematical
formula
the
confirmation
of
it
came
from
the
astronomers
as
he
himself
says
the
crucial
test
was
supplied
by
the
last
total
solar
eclipse
observations
then
proved
that
the
rays
of
fixed
stars
having
to
pass
close
to
the
sun
to
reach
the
earth
were
deflected
the
exact
amount
demanded
by
einstein
formulas
the
deflection
was
also
in
the
direction
predicted
by
him
the
question
must
have
occurred
to
many
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
relativity
when
this
query
was
propounded
by
the
times
correspondent
to
einstein
he
replied
as
follows
the
term
relativity
refers
to
time
and
space
according
to
galileo
and
newton
time
and
space
were
absolute
entities
and
the
moving
systems
of
the
universe
were
dependent
on
this
absolute
time
and
space
on
this
conception
was
built
the
science
of
mechanics
the
resulting
formulas
sufficed
for
all
motions
of
a
slow
nature
it
was
found
however
that
they
would
not
conform
to
the
rapid
motions
apparent
in
electrodynamics
this
led
the
dutch
professor
lorentz
and
myself
to
develop
the
theory
of
special
relativity
briefly
it
discards
absolute
time
and
space
and
makes
them
in
every
instance
relative
to
moving
systems
by
this
theory
all
phenomena
in
electrodynamics
as
well
as
mechanics
hitherto
irreducible
by
the
old
formulae
and
there
are
multitudes
were
satisfactorily
explained
till
now
it
was
believed
that
time
and
space
existed
by
themselves
even
if
there
was
nothing
else
no
sun
no
earth
no
stars
while
now
we
know
that
time
and
space
are
not
the
vessel
for
the
universe
but
could
not
exist
at
all
if
there
were
no
contents
namely
no
sun
earth
and
other
celestial
bodies
this
special
relativity
forming
the
first
part
of
my
theory
relates
to
all
systems
moving
with
uniform
motion
that
is
moving
in
a
straight
line
with
equal
velocity
gradually
i
was
led
to
the
idea
seeming
a
very
paradox
in
science
that
it
might
apply
equally
to
all
moving
systems
even
of
difform
motion
and
thus
i
developed
the
conception
of
general
relativity
which
forms
the
second
part
of
my
theory
as
summarized
by
an
american
astronomer
professor
henry
norris
russell
of
princeton
in
the
scientific
american
for
november
einstein
contribution
amounts
to
this
the
central
fact
which
has
been
proved
and
which
is
of
great
interest
and
importance
is
that
the
natural
phenomena
involving
gravitation
and
inertia
such
as
the
motions
of
the
planets
and
the
phenomena
involving
electricity
and
magnetism
including
the
motion
of
light
are
not
independent
of
one
another
but
are
intimately
related
so
that
both
sets
of
phenomena
should
be
regarded
as
parts
of
one
vast
system
embracing
all
nature
the
relation
of
the
two
is
however
of
such
a
character
that
it
is
perceptible
only
in
a
very
few
instances
and
then
only
to
refined
observations
already
before
the
war
einstein
had
immense
fame
among
physicists
and
among
all
who
are
interested
in
the
philosophy
of
science
because
of
his
principle
of
relativity
clerk
maxwell
had
shown
that
light
is
and
had
reduced
the
whole
theory
of
to
a
small
number
of
equations
which
are
fundamental
in
all
subsequent
work
but
these
equations
were
entangled
with
the
hypothesis
of
the
ether
and
with
the
notion
of
motion
relative
to
the
ether
since
the
ether
was
supposed
to
be
at
rest
such
motion
was
indistinguishable
from
absolute
motion
the
motion
of
the
earth
relatively
to
the
ether
should
have
been
different
at
different
points
of
its
orbit
and
measurable
phenomena
should
have
resulted
from
this
difference
but
none
did
and
all
attempts
to
detect
effects
of
motions
relative
to
the
ether
failed
the
theory
of
relativity
succeeded
in
accounting
for
this
fact
but
it
was
necessary
incidentally
to
throw
over
the
one
universal
time
and
substitute
local
times
attached
to
moving
bodies
and
varying
according
to
their
motion
the
equations
on
which
the
theory
of
relativity
is
based
are
due
to
lorentz
but
einstein
connected
them
with
his
general
principle
namely
that
there
must
be
nothing
in
observable
phenomena
which
could
be
attributed
to
absolute
motion
of
the
observer
in
orthodox
newtonian
dynamics
the
principle
of
relativity
had
a
simpler
form
which
did
not
require
the
substitution
of
local
time
for
general
time
but
it
now
appeared
that
newtonian
dynamics
is
only
valid
when
we
confine
ourselves
to
velocities
much
less
than
that
of
light
the
whole
system
thus
sank
to
the
level
of
a
first
approximation
becoming
progressively
less
exact
as
the
velocities
concerned
approached
that
of
light
einstein
extension
of
his
principle
so
as
to
account
for
gravitation
was
made
during
the
war
and
for
a
considerable
period
our
astronomers
were
unable
to
become
acquainted
with
it
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
german
printed
matter
however
copies
of
his
work
ultimately
reached
the
outside
world
and
enabled
people
to
learn
more
about
it
gravitation
ever
since
newton
had
remained
isolated
from
other
forces
in
nature
various
attempts
had
been
made
to
account
for
it
but
without
success
the
immense
unification
effected
by
apparently
left
gravitation
out
of
its
scope
it
seemed
that
nature
had
presented
a
challenge
to
the
physicists
which
none
of
them
were
able
to
meet
at
this
point
einstein
intervened
with
a
hypothesis
which
apart
altogether
from
subsequent
verification
deserves
to
rank
as
one
of
the
great
monuments
of
human
genius
after
correcting
newton
it
remained
to
correct
euclid
and
it
was
in
terms
of
geometry
that
he
stated
his
new
theory
geometry
is
a
study
of
which
the
primary
motive
was
logical
and
philosophical
few
of
its
promoters
ever
dreamed
that
it
would
come
to
be
applied
in
physics
some
of
euclid
axioms
were
felt
to
be
not
necessary
truths
but
mere
empirical
laws
in
order
to
establish
this
view
geometries
were
constructed
upon
assumptions
other
than
those
of
euclid
in
these
geometries
the
sum
of
the
angles
of
a
triangle
is
not
two
right
angles
and
the
departure
from
two
right
angles
increases
as
the
size
of
the
triangle
increases
it
is
often
said
that
in
geometry
space
has
a
curvature
but
this
way
of
stating
the
matter
is
misleading
since
it
seems
to
imply
a
fourth
dimension
which
is
not
implied
by
these
systems
einstein
supposes
that
space
is
euclidean
where
it
is
sufficiently
remote
from
matter
but
that
the
presence
of
matter
causes
it
to
become
slightly
the
more
matter
there
is
in
the
neighborhood
the
more
space
will
depart
from
euclid
by
the
help
of
this
hypothesis
together
with
his
previous
theory
of
relativity
he
deduces
gravitation
very
approximately
but
not
exactly
according
to
the
newtonian
law
of
the
inverse
square
the
minute
differences
between
the
effects
deduced
from
his
theory
and
those
deduced
from
newton
are
measurable
in
certain
cases
there
are
so
far
three
crucial
tests
of
the
relative
accuracy
of
the
new
theory
and
the
old
the
perihelion
of
mercury
shows
a
discrepancy
which
has
long
puzzled
astronomers
this
discrepancy
is
fully
accounted
for
by
einstein
at
the
time
when
he
published
his
theory
this
was
its
only
experimental
verification
modern
physicists
were
willing
to
suppose
that
light
might
be
subject
to
gravitation
that
a
ray
of
light
passing
near
a
great
mass
like
the
sun
might
be
deflected
to
the
extent
to
which
a
particle
moving
with
the
same
velocity
would
be
deflected
according
to
the
orthodox
theory
of
gravitation
but
einstein
theory
required
that
the
light
should
be
deflected
just
twice
as
much
as
this
the
matter
could
only
be
tested
during
an
eclipse
among
a
number
of
bright
stars
fortunately
a
peculiarly
favourable
eclipse
occurred
last
year
the
results
of
the
observations
have
now
been
published
and
are
found
to
verify
einstein
prediction
the
verification
is
not
of
course
quite
exact
with
such
delicate
observations
that
was
not
to
be
expected
in
some
cases
the
departure
is
considerable
but
taking
the
average
of
the
best
series
of
observations
the
deflection
at
the
sun
limb
is
found
to
be
with
a
probable
error
of
about
per
whereas
the
deflection
calculated
by
einstein
theory
should
be
it
will
be
noticed
that
einstein
theory
gave
a
deflection
twice
as
large
as
that
predicted
by
the
orthodox
theory
and
that
the
observed
deflection
is
slightly
larger
than
einstein
predicted
the
discrepancy
is
well
within
what
might
be
expected
in
view
of
the
minuteness
of
the
measurements
it
is
therefore
generally
acknowledged
by
astronomers
that
the
outcome
is
a
triumph
for
einstein
in
the
excitement
of
this
sensational
verification
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
overlook
the
third
experimental
test
to
which
einstein
theory
was
to
be
subjected
if
his
theory
is
correct
as
it
stands
there
ought
in
a
gravitational
field
to
be
a
displacement
of
the
lines
of
the
spectrum
towards
the
red
no
such
effect
has
been
discovered
spectroscopists
maintain
that
so
far
as
can
be
seen
at
present
there
is
no
way
of
accounting
for
this
failure
if
einstein
theory
in
its
present
form
is
assumed
they
admit
that
some
compensating
cause
may
be
discovered
to
explain
the
discrepancy
but
they
think
it
far
more
probable
that
einstein
theory
requires
some
essential
modification
meanwhile
a
certain
suspense
of
judgment
is
called
for
the
new
law
has
been
so
amazingly
successful
in
two
of
the
three
tests
that
there
must
be
some
thing
valid
about
it
even
if
it
is
not
exactly
right
as
yet
einstein
theory
has
the
very
highest
degree
of
aesthetic
merit
every
lover
of
the
beautiful
must
wish
it
to
be
true
it
gives
a
vast
unified
survey
of
the
operations
of
nature
with
a
technical
simplicity
in
the
critical
assumptions
which
makes
the
wealth
of
deductions
astonishing
it
is
a
case
of
an
advance
arrived
at
by
pure
theory
the
whole
effect
of
einstein
work
is
to
make
physics
more
philosophical
in
a
good
sense
and
to
restore
some
of
that
intellectual
unity
which
belonged
to
the
great
scientific
systems
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
but
which
was
lost
through
increasing
specialization
and
the
overwhelming
mass
of
detailed
knowledge
in
some
ways
our
age
is
not
a
good
one
to
live
in
but
for
those
who
are
interested
in
physics
there
are
great
compensations
the
einstein
theory
of
relativity
a
concise
statement
by
lorentz
of
the
university
of
leyden
the
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
of
may
resulted
in
a
striking
confirmation
of
the
new
theory
of
the
universal
attractive
power
of
gravitation
developed
by
albert
einstein
and
thus
reinforced
the
conviction
that
the
defining
of
this
theory
is
one
of
the
most
important
steps
ever
taken
in
the
domain
of
natural
science
in
response
to
a
request
by
the
editor
i
will
attempt
to
contribute
something
to
its
general
appreciation
in
the
following
lines
for
centuries
newton
doctrine
of
the
attraction
of
gravitation
has
been
the
most
prominent
example
of
a
theory
of
natural
science
through
the
simplicity
of
its
basic
idea
an
attraction
between
two
bodies
proportionate
to
their
mass
and
also
proportionate
to
the
square
of
the
distance
through
the
completeness
with
which
it
explained
so
many
of
the
peculiarities
in
the
movement
of
the
bodies
making
up
the
solar
system
and
finally
through
its
universal
validity
even
in
the
case
of
the
planetary
systems
it
compelled
the
admiration
of
all
but
while
the
skill
of
the
mathematicians
was
devoted
to
making
more
exact
calculations
of
the
consequences
to
which
it
led
no
real
progress
was
made
in
the
science
of
gravitation
it
is
true
that
the
inquiry
was
transferred
to
the
field
of
physics
following
cavendish
success
in
demonstrating
the
common
attraction
between
bodies
with
which
laboratory
work
can
be
done
but
it
always
was
evident
that
natural
philosophy
had
no
grip
on
the
universal
power
of
attraction
while
in
electric
effects
an
influence
exercised
by
the
matter
placed
between
bodies
was
speedily
observed
the
of
a
new
and
fertile
doctrine
of
electricity
in
the
case
of
gravitation
not
a
trace
of
an
influence
exercised
by
intermediate
matter
could
ever
be
discovered
it
was
and
remained
inaccessible
and
unchangeable
without
any
connection
apparently
with
other
phenomena
of
natural
philosophy
einstein
has
put
an
end
to
this
isolation
it
is
now
well
established
that
gravitation
affects
not
only
matter
but
also
light
thus
strengthened
in
the
faith
that
his
theory
already
has
inspired
we
may
assume
with
him
that
there
is
not
a
single
physical
or
chemical
phenomenon
which
does
not
feel
although
very
probably
in
an
unnoticeable
degree
the
influence
of
gravitation
and
that
on
the
other
side
the
attraction
exercised
by
a
body
is
limited
in
the
first
place
by
the
quantity
of
matter
it
contains
and
also
to
some
degree
by
motion
and
by
the
physical
and
chemical
condition
in
which
it
moves
it
is
comprehensible
that
a
person
could
not
have
arrived
at
such
a
change
of
view
by
continuing
to
follow
the
old
beaten
paths
but
only
by
introducing
some
sort
of
new
idea
indeed
einstein
arrived
at
his
theory
through
a
train
of
thought
of
great
originality
let
me
try
to
restate
it
in
concise
terms
the
earth
as
a
moving
car
everyone
knows
that
a
person
may
be
sitting
in
any
kind
of
a
vehicle
without
noticing
its
progress
so
long
as
the
movement
does
not
vary
in
direction
or
speed
in
a
car
of
a
fast
express
train
objects
fall
in
just
the
same
way
as
in
a
coach
that
is
standing
still
only
when
we
look
at
objects
outside
the
train
or
when
the
air
can
enter
the
car
do
we
notice
indications
of
the
motion
we
may
compare
the
earth
with
such
a
moving
vehicle
which
in
its
course
around
the
sun
has
a
remarkable
speed
of
which
the
direction
and
velocity
during
a
considerable
period
of
time
may
be
regarded
as
constant
in
place
of
the
air
now
comes
so
it
was
reasoned
formerly
the
ether
which
fills
the
spaces
of
the
universe
and
is
the
carrier
of
light
and
of
phenomena
there
were
good
reasons
to
assume
that
the
earth
was
entirely
permeable
for
the
ether
and
could
travel
through
it
without
setting
it
in
motion
so
here
was
a
case
comparable
with
that
of
a
railroad
coach
open
on
all
sides
there
certainly
should
have
been
a
powerful
ether
wind
blowing
through
the
earth
and
all
our
instruments
and
it
was
to
have
been
expected
that
some
signs
of
it
would
be
noticed
in
connection
with
some
experiment
or
other
every
attempt
along
that
line
however
has
remained
fruitless
all
the
phenomena
examined
were
evidently
independent
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
that
this
is
the
way
they
do
function
was
brought
to
the
front
by
einstein
in
his
first
or
special
theory
of
relativity
for
him
the
ether
does
not
function
and
in
the
sketch
that
he
draws
of
natural
phenomena
there
is
no
mention
of
that
intermediate
matter
if
the
spaces
of
the
universe
are
filled
with
an
ether
let
us
suppose
with
a
substance
in
which
aside
from
eventual
vibrations
and
other
slight
movements
there
is
never
any
crowding
or
flowing
of
one
part
alongside
of
another
then
we
can
imagine
fixed
points
existing
in
it
for
example
points
in
a
straight
line
located
one
meter
apart
points
in
a
level
plain
like
the
angles
or
squares
on
a
chess
board
extending
out
into
infinity
and
finally
points
in
space
as
they
are
obtained
by
repeatedly
shifting
that
level
spot
a
distance
of
a
meter
in
the
direction
perpendicular
to
it
if
consequently
one
of
the
points
is
chosen
as
an
original
point
we
can
proceeding
from
that
point
reach
any
other
point
through
three
steps
in
the
common
perpendicular
directions
in
which
the
points
are
arranged
the
figures
showing
how
many
meters
are
comprized
in
each
of
the
steps
may
serve
to
indicate
the
place
reached
and
to
distinguish
it
from
any
other
these
are
as
is
said
the
of
these
places
comparable
for
example
with
the
numbers
on
a
map
giving
the
longitude
and
latitude
let
us
imagine
that
each
point
has
noted
upon
it
the
three
numbers
that
give
its
position
then
we
have
something
comparable
with
a
measure
with
numbered
subdivisions
only
we
now
have
to
do
one
might
say
with
a
good
many
imaginary
measures
in
three
common
perpendicular
directions
in
this
system
of
the
numbers
that
fix
the
position
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
bodies
may
now
be
read
off
at
any
moment
this
is
the
means
which
the
astronomers
and
their
mathematical
assistants
have
always
used
in
dealing
with
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
at
a
determined
moment
the
position
of
each
body
is
fixed
by
its
three
if
these
are
given
then
one
knows
also
the
common
distances
as
well
as
the
angles
formed
by
the
connecting
lines
and
the
movement
of
a
planet
is
to
be
known
as
soon
as
one
knows
how
its
are
changing
from
one
moment
to
the
other
thus
the
picture
that
one
forms
of
the
phenomena
stands
there
as
if
it
were
sketched
on
the
canvas
of
the
motionless
ether
einstein
departure
since
einstein
has
cut
loose
from
the
ether
he
lacks
this
canvas
and
therewith
at
the
first
glance
also
loses
the
possibility
of
fixing
the
positions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
mathematically
describing
their
movement
by
giving
comparisons
that
define
the
positions
at
every
moment
how
einstein
has
overcome
this
difficulty
may
be
somewhat
elucidated
through
a
simple
illustration
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
attraction
of
gravitation
causes
all
bodies
to
fall
along
vertical
lines
and
indeed
when
one
omits
the
resistance
of
the
air
with
an
equally
accelerated
movement
the
velocity
increases
in
equal
degrees
in
equal
consecutive
divisions
of
time
at
a
rate
that
in
this
country
gives
the
velocity
attained
at
the
end
of
a
second
as
centimeters
feet
per
second
the
number
defines
the
acceleration
in
the
field
of
gravitation
and
this
field
is
fully
characterized
by
that
single
number
with
its
help
we
can
also
calculate
the
movement
of
an
object
hurled
out
in
an
arbitrary
direction
in
order
to
measure
the
acceleration
we
let
the
body
drop
alongside
of
a
vertical
measure
set
solidly
on
the
ground
on
this
scale
we
read
at
every
moment
the
figure
that
indicates
the
height
the
only
that
is
of
importance
in
this
rectilinear
movement
now
we
ask
what
would
we
be
able
to
see
if
the
measure
were
not
bound
solidly
to
the
earth
if
it
let
us
suppose
moved
down
or
up
with
the
place
where
it
is
located
and
where
we
are
ourselves
if
in
this
case
the
speed
were
constant
then
and
this
is
in
accord
with
the
special
theory
of
relativity
there
would
be
no
motion
observed
at
all
we
should
again
find
an
acceleration
of
for
a
falling
body
it
would
be
different
if
the
measure
moved
with
changeable
velocity
if
it
went
down
with
a
constant
acceleration
of
itself
then
an
object
could
remain
permanently
at
the
same
point
on
the
measure
or
could
move
up
or
down
itself
alongside
of
it
with
constant
speed
the
relative
movement
of
the
body
with
regard
to
the
measure
should
be
without
acceleration
and
if
we
had
to
judge
only
by
what
we
observed
in
the
spot
where
we
were
and
which
was
falling
itself
then
we
should
get
the
impression
that
there
was
no
gravitation
at
all
if
the
measure
goes
down
with
an
acceleration
equal
to
a
half
or
a
third
of
what
it
just
was
then
the
relative
motion
of
the
body
will
of
course
be
accelerated
but
we
should
find
the
increase
in
velocity
per
second
or
of
if
finally
we
let
the
measure
rise
with
a
uniformly
accelerated
movement
then
we
shall
find
a
greater
acceleration
than
for
the
body
itself
thus
we
see
that
we
also
when
the
measure
is
not
attached
to
the
earth
disregarding
its
displacement
may
describe
the
motion
of
the
body
in
respect
to
the
measure
always
in
the
same
way
as
one
uniformly
accelerated
as
we
ascribe
now
and
again
a
fixed
value
to
the
acceleration
of
the
sphere
of
gravitation
in
a
particular
case
the
value
of
zero
of
course
in
the
case
here
under
consideration
the
use
of
a
measure
fixed
immovably
upon
the
earth
should
merit
all
recommendation
but
in
the
spaces
of
the
solar
system
we
have
now
that
we
have
abandoned
the
ether
no
such
support
we
can
no
longer
establish
a
system
of
like
the
one
just
mentioned
in
a
universal
intermediate
matter
and
if
we
were
to
arrive
in
one
way
or
another
at
a
definite
system
of
lines
crossing
each
other
in
three
directions
then
we
should
be
able
to
use
just
as
well
another
similar
system
that
in
respect
to
the
first
moves
this
or
that
way
we
should
also
be
able
to
remodel
the
system
of
in
all
kinds
of
ways
for
example
by
extension
or
compression
that
in
all
these
cases
for
fixed
bodies
that
do
not
participate
in
the
movement
or
the
remodelling
of
the
system
other
will
be
read
off
again
and
again
is
clear
new
system
or
what
way
einstein
had
to
follow
is
now
apparent
he
must
this
hardly
needs
to
be
said
in
calculating
definite
particular
cases
make
use
of
a
chosen
system
of
but
as
he
had
no
means
of
limiting
his
choice
beforehand
and
in
general
he
had
to
reserve
full
liberty
of
action
in
this
respect
therefore
he
made
it
his
aim
so
to
arrange
the
theory
that
no
matter
how
the
choice
was
made
the
phenomena
of
gravitation
so
far
as
its
effects
and
its
stimulation
by
the
attracting
bodies
are
concerned
may
always
be
described
in
the
same
way
through
comparisons
of
the
same
general
form
as
we
again
and
again
give
certain
values
to
the
numbers
that
mark
the
sphere
of
gravitation
for
the
sake
of
simplification
i
here
disregard
the
fact
that
einstein
desires
that
also
the
way
in
which
time
is
measured
and
represented
by
figures
shall
have
no
influence
upon
the
central
value
of
the
comparisons
whether
this
aim
could
be
attained
was
a
question
of
mathematical
inquiry
it
really
was
attained
remarkably
enough
and
we
may
say
to
the
surprise
of
einstein
himself
although
at
the
cost
of
considerable
simplicity
in
the
mathematical
form
it
appeared
necessary
for
the
fixation
of
the
field
of
gravitation
in
one
or
the
other
point
in
space
to
introduce
no
fewer
than
ten
quantities
in
the
place
of
the
one
that
occurred
in
the
example
mentioned
above
in
this
connection
it
is
of
importance
to
note
that
when
we
exclude
certain
possibilities
that
would
give
rise
to
still
greater
intricacy
the
form
of
comparison
used
by
einstein
to
present
the
theory
is
the
only
possible
one
the
principle
of
the
freedom
of
choice
in
was
the
only
one
by
which
he
needed
to
allow
himself
to
be
guided
although
thus
there
was
no
special
effort
made
to
reach
a
connection
with
the
theory
of
newton
it
was
evident
fortunately
at
the
end
of
the
experiment
that
the
connection
existed
if
we
avail
ourselves
of
the
simplifying
circumstance
that
the
velocities
of
the
heavenly
bodies
are
slight
in
comparison
with
that
of
light
then
we
can
deduce
the
theory
of
newton
from
the
new
theory
the
universal
relativity
theory
as
it
is
called
by
einstein
thus
all
the
conclusions
based
upon
the
newtonian
theory
hold
good
as
must
naturally
be
required
but
now
we
have
got
further
along
the
newtonian
theory
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
absolutely
correct
in
all
cases
there
are
slight
deviations
from
it
which
although
as
a
rule
unnoticeable
once
in
a
while
fall
within
the
range
of
observation
now
there
was
a
difficulty
in
the
movement
of
the
planet
mercury
which
could
not
be
solved
even
after
all
the
disturbances
caused
by
the
attraction
of
other
planets
had
been
taken
into
account
there
remained
an
inexplicable
phenomenon
an
extremely
slow
turning
of
the
ellipsis
described
by
mercury
on
its
own
plane
leverrier
had
found
that
it
amounted
to
seconds
a
century
einstein
found
that
according
to
his
formulas
this
movement
must
really
amount
to
just
that
much
thus
with
a
single
blow
he
solved
one
of
the
greatest
puzzles
of
astronomy
still
more
remarkable
because
it
has
a
bearing
upon
a
phenomenon
which
formerly
could
not
be
imagined
is
the
confirmation
of
prediction
regarding
the
influence
of
gravitation
upon
the
course
of
the
rays
of
light
that
such
an
influence
must
exist
is
taught
by
a
simple
examination
we
have
only
to
turn
back
for
a
moment
to
the
following
comparison
in
which
we
were
just
imagining
ourselves
to
make
our
observations
it
was
noted
that
when
the
compartment
is
falling
with
the
acceleration
of
the
phenomena
therein
will
occur
just
as
if
there
were
no
attraction
of
gravitation
we
can
then
see
an
object
a
stand
still
somewhere
in
open
space
a
projectile
b
can
travel
with
constant
speed
along
a
horizontal
line
without
varying
from
it
in
the
slightest
a
ray
of
light
can
do
the
same
everybody
will
admit
that
in
each
case
if
there
is
no
gravitation
light
will
certainly
extend
itself
in
a
rectilinear
way
if
we
limit
the
light
to
a
flicker
of
the
slightest
duration
so
that
only
a
little
bit
c
of
a
ray
of
light
arises
or
if
we
fix
our
attention
upon
a
single
vibration
of
light
c
while
we
on
the
other
hand
give
to
the
projectile
b
a
speed
equal
to
that
of
light
then
we
can
conclude
that
b
and
c
in
their
continued
motion
can
always
remain
next
to
each
other
now
if
we
watch
all
this
not
from
the
movable
compartment
but
from
a
place
on
the
earth
then
we
shall
note
the
usual
falling
movement
of
object
a
which
shows
us
that
we
have
to
deal
with
a
sphere
of
gravitation
the
projectile
b
will
in
a
bent
path
vary
more
and
more
from
a
horizontal
straight
line
and
the
light
will
do
the
same
because
if
we
observe
the
movements
from
another
standpoint
this
can
have
no
effect
upon
the
remaining
next
to
each
other
of
b
and
deflection
of
light
the
bending
of
a
ray
of
light
thus
described
is
much
too
light
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
to
be
observed
but
the
attraction
of
gravitation
exercised
by
the
sun
on
its
surface
is
because
of
its
great
mass
more
than
times
stronger
and
a
ray
of
light
that
goes
close
by
the
superficies
of
the
sun
must
surely
be
noticeably
bent
the
rays
of
a
star
that
are
seen
at
a
short
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
sun
will
going
along
the
sun
deviate
so
much
from
the
original
direction
that
they
strike
the
eye
of
an
observer
as
if
they
came
in
a
straight
line
from
a
point
somewhat
further
removed
than
the
real
position
of
the
star
from
the
sun
it
is
at
that
point
that
we
think
we
see
the
star
so
here
is
a
seeming
displacement
from
the
sun
which
increases
in
the
measure
in
which
the
star
is
observed
closer
to
the
sun
the
einstein
theory
teaches
that
the
displacement
is
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
apparent
distance
of
the
star
from
the
centre
of
the
sun
and
that
for
a
star
just
on
its
edge
it
will
amount
to
seconds
this
is
approximately
the
thousandth
part
of
the
apparent
diameter
of
the
sun
naturally
the
phenomenon
can
only
be
observed
when
there
is
a
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
then
one
can
take
photographs
of
neighboring
stars
and
through
comparing
the
plate
with
a
picture
of
the
same
part
of
the
heavens
taken
at
a
time
when
the
sun
was
far
removed
from
that
point
the
movement
to
one
side
may
become
apparent
thus
to
put
the
einstein
theory
to
the
test
was
the
principal
aim
of
the
english
expeditions
sent
out
to
observe
the
eclipse
of
may
one
to
prince
island
off
the
coast
of
guinea
and
the
other
to
sobral
brazil
the
expedition
observers
were
eddington
and
cottingham
those
of
the
second
crommelin
and
davidson
the
conditions
were
especially
favorable
for
a
very
large
number
of
bright
stars
were
shown
on
the
photographic
plate
the
observers
at
sobral
being
particularly
lucky
in
having
good
weather
the
total
eclipse
lasted
five
minutes
during
four
of
which
it
was
perfectly
clear
so
that
good
photographs
could
be
taken
in
the
report
issued
regarding
the
results
the
following
figures
which
are
the
average
of
the
measurements
made
from
the
seven
plates
are
given
for
the
displacements
of
seven
stars
whereas
according
to
the
theory
the
displacements
should
have
amounted
to
if
we
consider
that
according
to
the
theory
the
displacements
must
be
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
sun
then
we
may
deduce
from
each
observed
displacement
how
great
the
sideways
movement
for
a
star
at
the
edge
of
the
sun
should
have
been
as
the
most
probable
result
therefore
the
number
was
found
from
all
the
observations
together
as
the
last
of
the
displacements
given
above
is
about
of
this
we
may
say
that
the
influence
of
the
attraction
of
the
sun
upon
light
made
itself
felt
upon
the
ray
at
a
distance
eight
times
removed
from
its
centre
the
displacements
calculated
according
to
the
theory
are
just
because
of
the
way
in
which
they
are
calculated
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
distance
to
the
centre
now
that
the
observed
deviations
also
accord
with
the
same
rule
it
follows
that
they
are
surely
proportionate
with
the
calculated
displacements
the
proportion
of
the
first
and
the
last
observed
sidewise
movements
is
and
that
of
the
two
most
extreme
of
the
calculated
numbers
is
this
result
is
of
importance
because
thereby
the
theory
is
excluded
or
at
least
made
extremely
improbable
that
the
phenomenon
of
refraction
is
to
be
ascribed
to
a
ring
of
vapor
surrounding
the
sun
for
a
great
distance
indeed
such
a
refraction
should
cause
a
deviation
in
the
observed
direction
and
in
order
to
produce
the
displacement
of
one
of
the
stars
under
observation
itself
a
slight
proximity
of
the
vapor
ring
should
be
sufficient
but
we
have
every
reason
to
expect
that
if
it
were
merely
a
question
of
a
mass
of
gas
around
the
sun
the
diminishing
effect
accompanying
a
removal
from
the
sun
should
manifest
itself
much
faster
than
is
really
the
case
we
can
not
speak
with
perfect
certainty
here
as
all
the
factors
that
might
be
of
influence
upon
the
distribution
of
density
in
a
sun
atmosphere
are
not
well
enough
known
but
we
can
surely
demonstrate
that
in
case
one
of
the
gasses
with
which
we
are
acquainted
were
held
in
equilibrium
solely
by
the
influence
of
attraction
of
the
sun
the
phenomenon
should
become
much
less
as
soon
as
we
got
somewhat
further
from
the
edge
of
the
sun
if
the
displacement
of
the
first
star
which
amounts
to
were
to
be
ascribed
to
such
a
mass
of
gas
then
the
displacement
of
the
second
must
already
be
entirely
inappreciable
so
far
as
the
absolute
extent
of
the
displacements
is
concerned
it
was
found
somewhat
too
great
as
has
been
shown
by
the
figures
given
above
it
also
appears
from
the
final
result
to
be
for
the
edge
of
the
sun
per
cent
greater
than
the
theoretical
value
of
it
indeed
seems
that
the
discrepancies
may
be
ascribed
to
faults
in
observations
which
supposition
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
observations
at
prince
island
which
it
is
true
did
not
turn
out
quite
as
well
as
those
mentioned
above
gave
the
result
of
somewhat
lower
than
einstein
figure
the
observations
made
with
a
second
instrument
at
sobral
gave
a
result
of
but
the
observers
are
of
the
opinion
that
because
of
the
shifting
of
the
mirror
which
reflected
the
rays
no
value
is
to
be
attached
to
it
difficulty
exaggerated
during
a
discussion
of
the
results
obtained
at
a
joint
meeting
of
the
royal
society
and
the
royal
astronomical
society
held
especially
for
that
purpose
recently
in
london
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
einstein
prediction
might
be
regarded
as
justified
and
warm
tributes
to
his
genius
were
made
on
all
sides
nevertheless
i
can
not
refrain
while
i
am
mentioning
it
from
expressing
my
surprise
that
according
to
the
report
in
the
times
there
should
be
so
much
complaint
about
the
difficulty
of
understanding
the
new
theory
it
is
evident
that
einstein
little
book
about
the
special
and
the
general
theory
of
relativity
in
plain
terms
did
not
find
its
way
into
england
during
wartime
any
one
reading
it
will
in
my
opinion
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
basic
ideas
of
the
theory
are
really
clear
and
simple
it
is
only
to
be
regretted
that
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
clothing
them
in
pretty
involved
mathematical
terms
but
we
must
not
worry
about
that
i
allow
myself
to
add
that
as
we
follow
einstein
we
may
retain
much
of
what
has
been
formerly
gained
the
newtonian
theory
remains
in
its
full
value
as
the
first
great
step
without
which
one
can
not
imagine
the
development
of
astronomy
and
without
which
the
second
step
that
has
now
been
made
would
hardly
have
been
possible
it
remains
moreover
as
the
first
and
in
most
cases
sufficient
approximation
it
is
true
that
according
to
einstein
theory
because
it
leaves
us
entirely
free
as
to
the
way
in
which
we
wish
to
represent
the
phenomena
we
can
imagine
an
idea
of
the
solar
system
in
which
the
planets
follow
paths
of
peculiar
form
and
the
rays
of
light
shine
along
sharply
bent
lines
think
of
a
twisted
and
distorted
planetarium
but
in
every
case
where
we
apply
it
to
concrete
questions
we
shall
so
arrange
it
that
the
planets
describe
almost
exact
ellipses
and
the
rays
of
light
almost
straight
lines
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
up
entirely
even
the
ether
many
natural
philosophers
find
satisfaction
in
the
idea
of
a
material
intermediate
substance
in
which
the
vibrations
of
light
take
place
and
they
will
very
probably
be
all
the
more
inclined
to
imagine
such
a
medium
when
they
learn
that
according
to
the
einstein
theory
gravitation
itself
does
not
spread
instantaneously
but
with
a
velocity
that
at
the
first
estimate
may
be
compared
with
that
of
light
especially
in
former
years
were
such
interpretations
current
and
repeated
attempts
were
made
by
speculations
about
the
nature
of
the
ether
and
about
the
mutations
and
movements
that
might
take
place
in
it
to
arrive
at
a
clear
presentation
of
phenomena
and
also
of
the
functioning
of
gravitation
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
impossible
that
in
the
future
this
road
indeed
abandoned
at
present
will
once
more
be
followed
with
good
results
if
only
because
it
can
lead
to
the
thinking
out
of
new
experimental
tests
einstein
theory
need
not
keep
us
from
so
doing
only
the
ideas
about
the
ether
must
accord
with
it
nevertheless
even
without
the
color
and
clearness
that
the
ether
theories
and
the
other
models
may
be
able
to
give
and
even
we
can
feel
it
this
way
just
because
of
the
soberness
induced
by
their
absence
einstein
work
we
may
now
positively
expect
will
remain
a
monument
of
science
his
theory
entirely
fulfills
the
first
and
principal
demand
that
we
may
make
that
of
deducing
the
course
of
phenomena
from
certain
principles
exactly
and
to
the
smallest
details
it
was
certainly
fortunate
that
he
himself
put
the
ether
in
the
background
if
he
had
not
done
so
he
probably
would
never
have
come
upon
the
idea
that
has
been
the
foundation
of
all
his
examinations
thanks
to
his
indefatigable
exertions
and
perseverance
for
he
had
great
difficulties
to
overcome
in
his
attempts
einstein
has
attained
the
results
which
i
have
tried
to
sketch
while
still
young
he
is
now
years
old
he
completed
his
first
investigations
in
switzerland
where
he
first
was
engaged
in
the
patent
bureau
at
berne
and
later
as
a
professor
at
the
polytechnic
in
zurich
after
having
been
a
professor
for
a
short
time
at
the
university
of
prague
he
settled
in
berlin
where
the
kaiser
wilhelm
institute
afforded
him
the
opportunity
to
devote
himself
exclusively
to
his
scientific
work
he
repeatedly
visited
our
country
and
made
his
netherland
colleagues
among
whom
he
counts
many
good
friends
partners
in
his
studies
and
his
results
he
attended
the
last
meeting
of
the
department
of
natural
philosophy
of
the
royal
academy
of
sciences
and
the
members
then
had
the
privilege
of
hearing
him
explain
in
his
own
fascinating
clear
and
simple
way
his
interpretations
of
the
fundamental
questions
to
which
his
theory
gives
rise
