the
athenian
constitution
by
aristotle
translated
by
sir
frederic
kenyon
part
they
were
tried
by
a
court
empanelled
from
among
the
noble
families
and
sworn
upon
the
sacrifices
the
part
of
accuser
was
taken
by
myron
they
were
found
guilty
of
the
sacrilege
and
their
bodies
were
cast
out
of
their
graves
and
their
race
banished
for
evermore
in
view
of
this
expiation
epimenides
the
cretan
performed
a
purification
of
the
city
part
after
this
event
there
was
contention
for
a
long
time
between
the
upper
classes
and
the
populace
not
only
was
the
constitution
at
this
time
oligarchical
in
every
respect
but
the
poorer
classes
men
women
and
children
were
the
serfs
of
the
rich
they
were
known
as
pelatae
and
also
as
hectemori
because
they
cultivated
the
lands
of
the
rich
at
the
rent
thus
indicated
the
whole
country
was
in
the
hands
of
a
few
persons
and
if
the
tenants
failed
to
pay
their
rent
they
were
liable
to
be
haled
into
slavery
and
their
children
with
them
all
loans
secured
upon
the
debtor
person
a
custom
which
prevailed
until
the
time
of
solon
who
was
the
first
to
appear
as
the
champion
of
the
people
but
the
hardest
and
bitterest
part
of
the
constitution
in
the
eyes
of
the
masses
was
their
state
of
serfdom
not
but
what
they
were
also
discontented
with
every
other
feature
of
their
lot
for
to
speak
generally
they
had
no
part
nor
share
in
anything
part
now
the
ancient
constitution
as
it
existed
before
the
time
of
draco
was
organized
as
follows
the
magistrates
were
elected
according
to
qualifications
of
birth
and
wealth
at
first
they
governed
for
life
but
subsequently
for
terms
of
ten
years
the
first
magistrates
both
in
date
and
in
importance
were
the
king
the
polemarch
and
the
archon
the
earliest
of
these
offices
was
that
of
the
king
which
existed
from
ancestral
antiquity
to
this
was
added
secondly
the
office
of
polemarch
on
account
of
some
of
the
kings
proving
feeble
in
war
for
it
was
on
this
account
that
ion
was
invited
to
accept
the
post
on
an
occasion
of
pressing
need
the
last
of
the
three
offices
was
that
of
the
archon
which
most
authorities
state
to
have
come
into
existence
in
the
time
of
medon
others
assign
it
to
the
time
of
acastus
and
adduce
as
proof
the
fact
that
the
nine
archons
swear
to
execute
their
oaths
in
the
days
of
acastus
which
seems
to
suggest
that
it
was
in
his
time
that
the
descendants
of
codrus
retired
from
the
kingship
in
return
for
the
prerogatives
conferred
upon
the
archon
whichever
way
it
may
be
the
difference
in
date
is
small
but
that
it
was
the
last
of
these
magistracies
to
be
created
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
archon
has
no
part
in
the
ancestral
sacrifices
as
the
king
and
the
polemarch
have
but
exclusively
in
those
of
later
origin
so
it
is
only
at
a
comparatively
late
date
that
the
office
of
archon
has
become
of
great
importance
through
the
dignity
conferred
by
these
later
additions
the
thesmothetae
were
many
years
afterwards
when
these
offices
had
already
become
annual
with
the
object
that
they
might
publicly
record
all
legal
decisions
and
act
as
guardians
of
them
with
a
view
to
determining
the
issues
between
litigants
accordingly
their
office
alone
of
those
which
have
been
mentioned
was
never
of
more
than
annual
duration
such
then
is
the
relative
chronological
precedence
of
these
offices
at
that
time
the
nine
archons
did
not
all
live
together
the
king
occupied
the
building
now
known
as
the
boculium
near
the
prytaneum
as
may
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
even
to
the
present
day
the
marriage
of
the
king
wife
to
dionysus
takes
place
there
the
archon
lived
in
the
prytaneum
the
polemarch
in
the
epilyceum
the
latter
building
was
formerly
called
the
polemarcheum
but
after
epilycus
during
his
term
of
office
as
polemarch
had
rebuilt
it
and
fitted
it
up
it
was
called
the
epilyceum
the
thesmothetae
occupied
the
thesmotheteum
in
the
time
of
solon
however
they
all
came
together
into
the
thesmotheteum
they
had
power
to
decide
cases
finally
on
their
own
authority
not
as
now
merely
to
hold
a
preliminary
hearing
such
then
was
the
arrangement
of
the
magistracies
the
council
of
areopagus
had
as
its
constitutionally
assigned
duty
the
protection
of
the
laws
but
in
point
of
fact
it
administered
the
greater
and
most
important
part
of
the
government
of
the
state
and
inflicted
personal
punishments
and
fines
summarily
upon
all
who
misbehaved
themselves
this
was
the
natural
consequence
of
the
facts
that
the
archons
were
elected
under
qualifications
of
birth
and
wealth
and
that
the
areopagus
was
composed
of
those
who
had
served
as
archons
for
which
latter
reason
the
membership
of
the
areopagus
is
the
only
office
which
has
continued
to
be
a
to
the
present
day
part
such
was
in
outline
the
first
constitution
but
not
very
long
after
the
events
above
recorded
in
the
archonship
of
aristaichmus
draco
enacted
his
ordinances
now
his
constitution
had
the
following
form
the
franchise
was
given
to
all
who
could
furnish
themselves
with
a
military
equipment
the
nine
archons
and
the
treasurers
were
elected
by
this
body
from
persons
possessing
an
unencumbered
property
of
not
less
than
ten
minas
the
less
important
officials
from
those
who
could
furnish
themselves
with
a
military
equipment
and
the
generals
strategi
and
commanders
of
the
cavalry
hipparchi
from
those
who
could
show
an
unencumbered
property
of
not
less
than
a
hundred
minas
and
had
children
born
in
lawful
wedlock
over
ten
years
of
age
these
officers
were
required
to
hold
to
bail
the
prytanes
the
strategi
and
the
hipparchi
of
the
preceding
year
until
their
accounts
had
been
audited
taking
four
securities
of
the
same
class
as
that
to
which
the
strategi
and
the
hipparchi
belonged
there
was
also
to
be
a
council
consisting
of
four
hundred
and
one
members
elected
by
lot
from
among
those
who
possessed
the
franchise
both
for
this
and
for
the
other
magistracies
the
lot
was
cast
among
those
who
were
over
thirty
years
of
age
and
no
one
might
hold
office
twice
until
every
one
else
had
had
his
turn
after
which
they
were
to
cast
the
lot
afresh
if
any
member
of
the
council
failed
to
attend
when
there
was
a
sitting
of
the
council
or
of
the
assembly
he
paid
a
fine
to
the
amount
of
three
drachmas
if
he
was
a
pentacosiomedimnus
two
if
he
was
a
knight
and
one
if
he
was
a
zeugites
the
council
of
areopagus
was
guardian
of
the
laws
and
kept
watch
over
the
magistrates
to
see
that
they
executed
their
offices
in
accordance
with
the
laws
any
person
who
felt
himself
wronged
might
lay
an
information
before
the
council
of
areopagus
on
declaring
what
law
was
broken
by
the
wrong
done
to
him
but
as
has
been
said
before
loans
were
secured
upon
the
persons
of
the
debtors
and
the
land
was
in
the
hands
of
a
few
part
since
such
then
was
the
organization
of
the
constitution
and
the
many
were
in
slavery
to
the
few
the
people
rose
against
the
upper
class
the
strife
was
keen
and
for
a
long
time
the
two
parties
were
ranged
in
hostile
camps
against
one
another
till
at
last
by
common
consent
they
appointed
solon
to
be
mediator
and
archon
and
committed
the
whole
constitution
to
his
hands
the
immediate
occasion
of
his
appointment
was
his
poem
which
begins
with
the
words
i
behold
and
within
my
heart
deep
sadness
has
claimed
its
place
as
i
mark
the
oldest
home
of
the
ancient
ionian
race
slain
by
the
sword
in
this
poem
he
fights
and
disputes
on
behalf
of
each
party
in
turn
against
the
other
and
finally
he
advises
them
to
come
to
terms
and
put
an
end
to
the
quarrel
existing
between
them
by
birth
and
reputation
solon
was
one
of
the
foremost
men
of
the
day
but
in
wealth
and
position
he
was
of
the
middle
class
as
is
generally
agreed
and
is
indeed
established
by
his
own
evidence
in
these
poems
where
he
exhorts
the
wealthy
not
to
be
grasping
but
ye
who
have
store
of
good
who
are
sated
and
overflow
restrain
your
swelling
soul
and
still
it
and
keep
it
low
let
the
heart
that
is
great
within
you
be
trained
a
lowlier
way
ye
shall
not
have
all
at
your
will
and
we
will
not
for
ever
obey
indeed
he
constantly
fastens
the
blame
of
the
conflict
on
the
rich
and
accordingly
at
the
beginning
of
the
poem
he
says
that
he
fears
love
of
wealth
and
an
overweening
mind
evidently
meaning
that
it
was
through
these
that
the
quarrel
arose
part
as
soon
as
he
was
at
the
head
of
affairs
solon
liberated
the
people
once
and
for
all
by
prohibiting
all
loans
on
the
security
of
the
debtor
person
and
in
addition
he
made
laws
by
which
he
cancelled
all
debts
public
and
private
this
measure
is
commonly
called
the
seisachtheia
removal
of
burdens
since
thereby
the
people
had
their
loads
removed
from
them
in
connexion
with
it
some
persons
try
to
traduce
the
character
of
solon
it
so
happened
that
when
he
was
about
to
enact
the
seisachtheia
he
communicated
his
intention
to
some
members
of
the
upper
class
whereupon
as
the
partisans
of
the
popular
party
say
his
friends
stole
a
march
on
him
while
those
who
wish
to
attack
his
character
maintain
that
he
too
had
a
share
in
the
fraud
himself
for
these
persons
borrowed
money
and
bought
up
a
large
amount
of
land
and
so
when
a
short
time
afterwards
all
debts
were
cancelled
they
became
wealthy
and
this
they
say
was
the
origin
of
the
families
which
were
afterwards
looked
on
as
having
been
wealthy
from
primeval
times
however
the
story
of
the
popular
party
is
by
far
the
most
probable
a
man
who
was
so
moderate
and
in
all
his
other
actions
that
when
it
was
within
his
power
to
put
his
beneath
his
feet
and
establish
himself
as
tyrant
he
preferred
instead
to
incur
the
hostility
of
both
parties
by
placing
his
honour
and
the
general
welfare
above
his
personal
aggrandisement
is
not
likely
to
have
consented
to
defile
his
hands
by
such
a
petty
and
palpable
fraud
that
he
had
this
absolute
power
is
in
the
first
place
indicated
by
the
desperate
condition
the
country
moreover
he
mentions
it
himself
repeatedly
in
his
poems
and
it
is
universally
admitted
we
are
therefore
bound
to
consider
this
accusation
to
be
false
part
next
solon
drew
up
a
constitution
and
enacted
new
laws
and
the
ordinances
of
draco
ceased
to
be
used
with
the
exception
of
those
relating
to
murder
the
laws
were
inscribed
on
the
wooden
stands
and
set
up
in
the
king
porch
and
all
swore
to
obey
them
and
the
nine
archons
made
oath
upon
the
stone
declaring
that
they
would
dedicate
a
golden
statue
if
they
should
transgress
any
of
them
this
is
the
origin
of
the
oath
to
that
effect
which
they
take
to
the
present
day
solon
ratified
his
laws
for
a
hundred
years
and
the
following
was
the
fashion
in
which
he
organized
the
constitution
he
divided
the
population
according
to
property
into
four
classes
just
as
it
had
been
divided
before
namely
pentacosiomedimni
knights
zeugitae
and
thetes
the
various
magistracies
namely
the
nine
archons
the
treasurers
the
commissioners
for
public
contracts
poletae
the
eleven
and
clerks
colacretae
he
assigned
to
the
pentacosiomedimni
the
knights
and
the
zeugitae
giving
offices
to
each
class
in
proportion
to
the
value
of
their
rateable
property
to
who
ranked
among
the
thetes
he
gave
nothing
but
a
place
in
the
assembly
and
in
the
juries
a
man
had
to
rank
as
a
pentacosiomedimnus
if
he
made
from
his
own
land
five
hundred
measures
whether
liquid
or
solid
those
ranked
as
knights
who
made
three
hundred
measures
or
as
some
say
those
who
were
able
to
maintain
a
horse
in
support
of
the
latter
definition
they
adduce
the
name
of
the
class
which
may
be
supposed
to
be
derived
from
this
fact
and
also
some
votive
offerings
of
early
times
for
in
the
acropolis
there
is
a
votive
offering
a
statue
of
diphilus
bearing
this
inscription
the
son
of
diphilus
athenion
hight
raised
from
the
thetes
and
become
a
knight
did
to
the
gods
this
sculptured
charger
bring
for
his
promotion
a
and
a
horse
stands
in
evidence
beside
the
man
implying
that
this
was
what
was
meant
by
belonging
to
the
rank
of
knight
at
the
same
time
it
seems
reasonable
to
suppose
that
this
class
like
the
pentacosiomedimni
was
defined
by
the
possession
of
an
income
of
a
certain
number
of
measures
those
ranked
as
zeugitae
who
made
two
hundred
measures
liquid
or
solid
and
the
rest
ranked
as
thetes
and
were
not
eligible
for
any
office
hence
it
is
that
even
at
the
present
day
when
a
candidate
for
any
office
is
asked
to
what
class
he
belongs
no
one
would
think
of
saying
that
he
belonged
to
the
thetes
part
the
elections
to
the
various
offices
solon
enacted
should
be
by
lot
out
of
candidates
selected
by
each
of
the
tribes
each
tribe
selected
ten
candidates
for
the
nine
archonships
and
among
these
the
lot
was
cast
hence
it
is
still
the
custom
for
each
tribe
to
choose
ten
candidates
by
lot
and
then
the
lot
is
again
cast
among
these
a
proof
that
solon
regulated
the
elections
to
office
according
to
the
property
classes
may
be
found
in
the
law
still
in
force
with
regard
to
the
treasurers
which
enacts
that
they
shall
be
chosen
from
the
pentacosiomedimni
such
was
solon
legislation
with
respect
to
the
nine
archons
whereas
in
early
times
the
council
of
areopagus
summoned
suitable
persons
according
to
its
own
judgement
and
appointed
them
for
the
year
to
the
several
offices
there
were
four
tribes
as
before
and
four
each
tribe
was
divided
into
three
trittyes
with
twelve
naucraries
in
each
and
the
naucraries
had
officers
of
their
own
called
naucrari
whose
duty
it
was
to
superintend
the
current
receipts
and
expenditure
hence
among
the
laws
of
solon
now
obsolete
it
is
repeatedly
written
that
the
naucrari
are
to
receive
and
to
spend
out
of
the
naucraric
fund
solon
also
appointed
a
council
of
four
hundred
a
hundred
from
each
tribe
but
he
assigned
to
the
council
of
the
areopagus
the
duty
of
superintending
the
laws
acting
as
before
as
the
guardian
of
the
constitution
in
general
it
kept
watch
over
the
affairs
of
the
state
in
most
of
the
more
important
matters
and
corrected
offenders
with
full
powers
to
inflict
either
fines
or
personal
punishment
the
money
received
in
fines
it
brought
up
into
the
acropolis
without
assigning
the
reason
for
the
mulct
it
also
tried
those
who
conspired
for
the
overthrow
of
the
state
solon
having
enacted
a
process
of
impeachment
to
deal
with
such
offenders
further
since
he
saw
the
state
often
engaged
in
internal
disputes
while
many
of
the
citizens
from
sheer
indifference
accepted
whatever
might
turn
up
he
made
a
law
with
express
reference
to
such
persons
enacting
that
any
one
who
in
a
time
transcriber
note
of
civil
factions
did
not
take
up
arms
with
either
party
should
lose
his
rights
as
a
citizen
and
cease
to
have
any
part
in
the
state
part
such
then
was
his
legislation
concerning
the
magistracies
there
are
three
points
in
the
constitution
of
solon
which
appear
to
be
its
most
democratic
features
first
and
most
important
the
prohibition
of
loans
on
the
security
of
the
debtor
person
secondly
the
right
of
every
person
who
so
willed
to
claim
redress
on
behalf
of
any
one
to
whom
wrong
was
being
done
thirdly
the
institution
of
the
appeal
to
the
jurycourts
and
it
is
to
this
last
they
say
that
the
masses
have
owed
their
strength
most
of
all
since
when
the
democracy
is
master
of
the
it
is
master
of
the
constitution
moreover
since
the
laws
were
not
drawn
up
in
simple
and
explicit
terms
but
like
the
one
concerning
inheritances
and
wards
of
state
disputes
inevitably
occurred
and
the
courts
had
to
decide
in
every
matter
whether
public
or
private
some
persons
in
fact
believe
that
solon
deliberately
made
the
laws
indefinite
in
order
that
the
final
decision
might
be
in
the
hands
of
the
people
this
however
is
not
probable
and
the
reason
no
doubt
was
that
it
is
impossible
to
attain
ideal
perfection
when
framing
a
law
in
general
terms
for
we
must
judge
of
his
intentions
not
from
the
actual
results
in
the
present
day
but
from
the
general
tenor
of
the
rest
of
his
legislation
part
these
seem
to
be
the
democratic
features
of
his
laws
but
in
addition
before
the
period
of
his
legislation
he
carried
through
his
abolition
of
debts
and
after
it
his
increase
in
the
standards
of
weights
and
measures
and
of
the
currency
during
his
administration
the
measures
were
made
larger
than
those
of
pheidon
and
the
mina
which
previously
had
a
standard
of
seventy
drachmas
was
raised
to
the
full
hundred
the
standard
coin
in
earlier
times
was
the
piece
he
also
made
weights
corresponding
with
the
coinage
minas
going
to
the
talent
and
the
odd
three
minas
were
distributed
among
the
staters
and
the
other
values
part
when
he
had
completed
his
organization
of
the
constitution
in
the
manner
that
has
been
described
he
found
himself
beset
by
people
coming
to
him
and
harassing
him
concerning
his
laws
criticizing
here
and
questioning
there
till
as
he
wished
neither
to
alter
what
he
had
decided
on
nor
yet
to
be
an
object
of
ill
will
to
every
one
by
remaining
in
athens
he
set
off
on
a
journey
to
egypt
with
the
combined
objects
of
trade
and
travel
giving
out
that
he
should
not
return
for
ten
years
he
considered
that
there
was
no
call
for
him
to
expound
the
laws
personally
but
that
every
one
should
obey
them
just
as
they
were
written
moreover
his
position
at
this
time
was
unpleasant
many
members
of
the
upper
class
had
been
estranged
from
him
on
account
of
his
abolition
of
debts
and
both
parties
were
alienated
through
their
disappointment
at
the
condition
of
things
which
he
had
created
the
mass
of
the
people
had
expected
him
to
make
a
complete
redistribution
of
all
property
and
the
upper
class
hoped
he
would
restore
everything
to
its
former
position
or
at
any
rate
make
but
a
small
change
solon
however
had
resisted
both
classes
he
might
have
made
himself
a
despot
by
attaching
himself
to
whichever
party
he
chose
but
he
preferred
though
at
the
cost
of
incurring
the
enmity
of
both
to
be
the
saviour
of
his
country
and
the
ideal
lawgiver
part
the
truth
of
this
view
of
solon
policy
is
established
alike
by
common
consent
and
by
the
mention
he
has
himself
made
of
the
matter
in
his
poems
thus
i
gave
to
the
mass
of
the
people
such
rank
as
befitted
their
need
i
took
not
away
their
honour
and
i
granted
naught
to
their
greed
while
those
who
were
rich
in
power
who
in
wealth
were
glorious
and
great
i
bethought
me
that
naught
should
befall
them
unworthy
their
splendour
and
state
so
i
stood
with
my
shield
outstretched
and
both
were
safe
in
its
sight
and
i
would
not
that
either
should
triumph
when
the
triumph
was
not
with
right
again
he
declares
how
the
mass
of
the
people
ought
to
be
treated
but
thus
will
the
people
best
the
voice
of
their
leaders
obey
when
neither
too
slack
is
the
rein
nor
violence
holdeth
the
sway
for
indulgence
breedeth
a
child
the
presumption
that
spurns
control
when
riches
too
great
are
poured
upon
men
of
unbalanced
soul
and
again
elsewhere
he
speaks
about
the
persons
who
wished
to
redistribute
the
land
so
they
came
in
search
of
plunder
and
their
cravings
knew
no
bound
every
one
among
them
deeming
endless
wealth
would
here
be
found
and
that
i
with
glozing
smoothness
hid
a
cruel
mind
within
fondly
then
and
vainly
dreamt
they
now
they
raise
an
angry
din
and
they
glare
askance
in
anger
and
the
light
within
their
eyes
burns
with
hostile
flames
upon
me
yet
therein
no
justice
lies
all
i
promised
fully
wrought
i
with
the
gods
at
hand
to
cheer
naught
beyond
in
folly
ventured
never
to
my
soul
was
dear
with
a
tyrant
force
to
govern
nor
to
see
the
good
and
base
side
by
side
in
equal
portion
share
the
rich
home
of
our
race
once
more
he
speaks
of
the
abolition
of
debts
and
of
those
who
before
were
in
servitude
but
were
released
owing
to
the
seisachtheia
of
all
the
aims
for
which
i
summoned
forth
the
people
was
there
one
i
compassed
not
thou
when
slow
time
brings
justice
in
its
train
o
mighty
mother
of
the
olympian
gods
dark
earth
thou
best
canst
witness
from
whose
breast
i
swept
the
pillars
broadcast
planted
there
and
made
thee
free
who
hadst
been
slave
of
yore
and
many
a
man
whom
fraud
or
law
had
sold
for
from
his
land
an
outcast
slave
i
brought
again
to
athens
yea
and
some
exiles
from
home
through
debt
oppressive
load
speaking
no
more
the
dear
athenian
tongue
but
wandering
far
and
wide
i
brought
again
and
those
that
here
in
vilest
slavery
crouched
a
master
frown
i
set
them
free
thus
might
and
right
were
yoked
in
harmony
since
by
the
force
of
law
i
won
my
ends
and
kept
my
promise
equal
laws
i
gave
to
evil
and
to
good
with
even
hand
drawing
straight
justice
for
the
lot
of
each
but
had
another
held
the
goad
as
one
in
whose
heart
was
guile
and
greediness
he
had
not
kept
the
people
back
from
strife
for
had
i
granted
now
what
pleased
the
one
then
what
their
foes
devised
in
counterpoise
of
many
a
man
this
state
had
been
bereft
therefore
i
showed
my
might
on
every
side
turning
at
bay
like
wolf
among
the
hounds
and
again
he
reviles
both
parties
for
their
grumblings
in
the
times
that
followed
nay
if
one
must
lay
blame
where
blame
is
due
not
for
me
the
people
had
set
their
eyes
upon
these
blessings
in
dreams
while
greater
men
the
men
of
wealthier
life
should
praise
me
and
should
court
me
as
their
friend
for
had
any
other
man
he
says
received
this
exalted
post
he
had
not
kept
the
people
back
nor
ceased
til
he
had
robbed
the
richness
of
the
milk
but
i
stood
forth
a
landmark
in
the
midst
and
barred
the
foes
from
battle
part
such
then
were
solon
reasons
for
his
departure
from
the
country
after
his
retirement
the
city
was
still
torn
by
divisions
for
four
years
indeed
they
lived
in
peace
but
in
the
fifth
year
after
government
they
were
unable
to
elect
an
archon
on
account
of
their
dissensions
and
again
four
years
later
they
elected
no
archon
for
the
same
reason
subsequently
after
a
similar
period
had
elapsed
damasias
was
elected
archon
and
he
governed
for
two
years
and
two
months
until
he
was
forcibly
expelled
from
his
office
after
this
it
was
agreed
as
a
compromise
to
elect
ten
archons
five
from
the
eupatridae
three
from
the
agroeci
and
two
from
the
demiurgi
and
they
ruled
for
the
year
following
damasias
it
is
clear
from
this
that
the
archon
was
at
the
time
the
magistrate
who
possessed
the
greatest
power
since
it
is
always
in
connexion
with
this
office
that
conflicts
are
seen
to
arise
but
altogether
they
were
in
a
continual
state
of
internal
disorder
some
found
the
cause
and
justification
of
their
discontent
in
the
abolition
of
debts
because
thereby
they
had
been
reduced
to
poverty
others
were
dissatisfied
with
the
political
constitution
because
it
had
undergone
a
revolutionary
change
while
with
others
the
motive
was
found
in
personal
rivalries
among
themselves
the
parties
at
this
time
were
three
in
number
first
there
was
the
party
of
the
shore
led
by
megacles
the
son
of
alcmeon
which
was
considered
to
aim
at
a
moderate
form
of
government
then
there
were
the
men
of
the
plain
who
desired
an
oligarchy
and
were
led
by
lycurgus
and
thirdly
there
were
the
men
of
the
highlands
at
the
head
of
whom
was
pisistratus
who
was
looked
on
as
an
extreme
democrat
this
latter
party
was
reinforced
by
those
who
had
been
deprived
of
the
debts
due
to
them
from
motives
of
poverty
and
by
those
who
were
not
of
pure
descent
from
motives
of
personal
apprehension
a
proof
of
this
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
after
the
tyranny
was
overthrown
a
revision
was
made
of
the
on
the
ground
that
many
persons
were
partaking
in
the
franchise
without
having
a
right
to
it
the
names
given
to
the
respective
parties
were
derived
from
the
districts
in
which
they
held
their
lands
part
pisistratus
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
extreme
democrat
and
he
also
had
distinguished
himself
greatly
in
the
war
with
megara
taking
advantage
of
this
he
wounded
himself
and
by
representing
that
his
injuries
had
been
inflicted
on
him
by
his
political
rivals
he
persuaded
the
people
through
a
motion
proposed
by
aristion
to
grant
him
a
bodyguard
after
he
had
got
these
as
they
were
called
he
made
an
attack
with
them
on
the
people
and
seized
the
acropolis
this
happened
in
the
archonship
of
comeas
years
after
the
legislation
of
solon
it
is
related
that
when
pisistratus
asked
for
his
bodyguard
solon
opposed
the
request
and
declared
that
in
so
doing
he
proved
himself
wiser
than
half
the
people
and
braver
than
the
rest
wiser
than
those
who
did
not
see
that
pisistratus
designed
to
make
himself
tyrant
and
braver
than
those
who
saw
it
and
kept
silence
but
when
all
his
words
availed
nothing
he
carried
forth
his
armour
and
set
it
up
in
front
of
his
house
saying
that
he
had
helped
his
country
so
far
as
lay
in
his
power
he
was
already
a
very
old
man
and
that
he
called
on
all
others
to
do
the
same
exhortations
however
proved
fruitless
and
pisistratus
assumed
the
sovereignty
his
administration
was
more
like
a
constitutional
government
than
the
rule
of
a
tyrant
but
before
his
power
was
firmly
established
the
adherents
of
megacles
and
lycurgus
made
a
coalition
and
drove
him
out
this
took
place
in
the
archonship
of
hegesias
five
years
after
the
first
establishment
of
his
rule
eleven
years
later
megacles
being
in
difficulties
in
a
party
struggle
again
opened
negotiations
with
pisistratus
proposing
that
the
latter
should
marry
his
daughter
and
on
these
terms
he
brought
him
back
to
athens
by
a
very
primitive
and
device
he
first
spread
abroad
a
rumour
that
athens
was
bringing
back
pisistratus
and
then
having
found
a
woman
of
great
stature
and
beauty
named
phye
according
to
herodotus
of
the
deme
of
paeania
but
as
others
say
a
thracian
of
the
deme
of
collytus
he
dressed
her
in
a
garb
resembling
that
of
the
goddess
and
brought
her
into
the
city
with
pisistratus
the
latter
drove
in
on
a
chariot
with
the
woman
beside
him
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
struck
with
awe
received
him
with
adoration
part
in
this
manner
did
his
first
return
take
place
he
did
not
however
hold
his
power
long
for
about
six
years
after
his
return
he
was
again
expelled
he
refused
to
treat
the
daughter
of
megacles
as
his
wife
and
being
afraid
in
consequence
of
a
combination
of
the
two
opposing
parties
he
retired
from
the
country
first
he
led
a
colony
to
a
place
called
rhaicelus
in
the
region
of
the
thermaic
gulf
and
thence
he
passed
to
the
country
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mt
pangaeus
here
he
acquired
wealth
and
hired
mercenaries
and
not
till
ten
years
had
elapsed
did
he
return
to
eretria
and
make
an
attempt
to
recover
the
government
by
force
in
this
he
had
the
assistance
of
many
allies
notably
the
thebans
and
lygdamis
of
naxos
and
also
the
knights
who
held
the
supreme
power
in
the
constitution
of
eretria
after
his
victory
in
the
battle
at
pallene
he
captured
athens
and
when
he
had
disarmed
the
people
he
at
last
had
his
tyranny
securely
established
and
was
able
to
take
naxos
and
set
up
lygdamis
as
ruler
there
he
effected
the
disarmament
of
the
people
in
the
following
manner
he
ordered
a
parade
in
full
armour
in
the
theseum
and
began
to
make
a
speech
to
the
people
he
spoke
for
a
short
time
until
the
people
called
out
that
they
could
not
hear
him
whereupon
he
bade
them
come
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
acropolis
in
order
that
his
voice
might
be
better
heard
then
while
he
continued
to
speak
to
them
at
great
length
men
whom
he
had
appointed
for
the
purpose
collected
the
arms
and
locked
them
up
in
the
chambers
of
the
theseum
hard
by
and
came
and
made
a
signal
to
him
that
it
was
done
pisistratus
accordingly
when
he
had
finished
the
rest
of
what
he
had
to
say
told
the
people
also
what
had
happened
to
their
arms
adding
that
they
were
not
to
be
surprised
or
alarmed
but
go
home
and
attend
to
their
private
affairs
while
he
would
himself
for
the
future
manage
all
the
business
of
the
state
part
such
was
the
origin
and
such
the
vicissitudes
of
the
tyranny
of
pisistratus
his
administration
was
temperate
as
has
been
said
before
and
more
like
constitutional
government
than
a
tyranny
not
only
was
he
in
every
respect
humane
and
mild
and
ready
to
forgive
those
who
offended
but
in
addition
he
advanced
money
to
the
poorer
people
to
help
them
in
their
labours
so
that
they
might
make
their
living
by
agriculture
in
this
he
had
two
objects
first
that
they
might
not
spend
their
time
in
the
city
but
might
be
scattered
over
all
the
face
of
the
country
and
secondly
that
being
moderately
well
off
and
occupied
with
their
own
business
they
might
have
neither
the
wish
nor
the
time
to
attend
to
public
affairs
at
the
same
time
his
revenues
were
increased
by
the
thorough
cultivation
of
the
country
since
he
imposed
a
tax
of
one
tenth
on
all
the
produce
for
the
same
reasons
he
instituted
the
local
justices
and
often
made
expeditions
in
person
into
the
country
to
inspect
it
and
to
settle
disputes
between
individuals
that
they
might
not
come
into
the
city
and
neglect
their
farms
it
was
in
one
of
these
progresses
that
as
the
story
goes
pisistratus
had
his
adventure
with
the
man
of
hymettus
who
was
cultivating
the
spot
afterwards
known
as
farm
he
saw
a
man
digging
and
working
at
a
very
stony
piece
of
ground
and
being
surprised
he
sent
his
attendant
to
ask
what
he
got
out
of
this
plot
of
land
and
pains
said
the
man
that
what
pisistratus
ought
to
have
his
tenth
of
the
man
spoke
without
knowing
who
his
questioner
was
but
pisistratus
was
so
pleased
with
his
frank
speech
and
his
industry
that
he
granted
him
exemption
from
all
taxes
and
so
in
matters
in
general
he
burdened
the
people
as
little
as
possible
with
his
government
but
always
cultivated
peace
and
kept
them
in
all
quietness
hence
the
tyranny
of
pisistratus
was
often
spoken
of
proverbially
as
age
of
gold
for
when
his
sons
succeeded
him
the
government
became
much
harsher
but
most
important
of
all
in
this
respect
was
his
popular
and
kindly
disposition
in
all
things
he
was
accustomed
to
observe
the
laws
without
giving
himself
any
exceptional
privileges
once
he
was
summoned
on
a
charge
of
homicide
before
the
areopagus
and
he
appeared
in
person
to
make
his
defence
but
the
prosecutor
was
afraid
to
present
himself
and
abandoned
the
case
for
these
reasons
he
held
power
long
and
whenever
he
was
expelled
he
regained
his
position
easily
the
majority
alike
of
the
upper
class
and
of
the
people
were
in
his
favour
the
former
he
won
by
his
social
intercourse
with
them
the
latter
by
the
assistance
which
he
gave
to
their
private
purses
and
his
nature
fitted
him
to
win
the
hearts
of
both
moreover
the
laws
in
reference
to
tyrants
at
that
time
in
force
at
athens
were
very
mild
especially
the
one
which
applies
more
particularly
to
the
establishment
of
a
tyranny
the
law
ran
as
follows
are
the
ancestral
statutes
of
the
athenians
if
any
persons
shall
make
an
attempt
to
establish
a
tyranny
or
if
any
person
shall
join
in
setting
up
a
tyranny
he
shall
lose
his
civic
rights
both
himself
and
his
whole
house
part
thus
did
pisistratus
grow
old
in
the
possession
of
power
and
he
died
a
natural
death
in
the
archonship
of
philoneos
three
and
thirty
years
from
the
time
at
which
he
first
established
himself
as
tyrant
during
nineteen
of
which
he
was
in
possession
of
power
the
rest
he
spent
in
exile
it
is
evident
from
this
that
the
story
is
mere
gossip
which
states
that
pisistratus
was
the
youthful
favourite
of
solon
and
commanded
in
the
war
against
megara
for
the
recovery
of
salamis
it
will
not
harmonize
with
their
respective
ages
as
any
one
may
see
who
will
reckon
up
the
years
of
the
life
of
each
of
them
and
the
dates
at
which
they
died
after
the
death
of
pisistratus
his
sons
took
up
the
government
and
conducted
it
on
the
same
system
he
had
two
sons
by
his
first
and
legitimate
wife
hippias
and
hipparchus
and
two
by
his
argive
consort
iophon
and
hegesistratus
who
was
surnamed
thessalus
for
pisistratus
took
a
wife
from
argos
timonassa
the
daughter
of
a
man
of
argos
named
gorgilus
she
had
previously
been
the
wife
of
archinus
of
ambracia
one
of
the
descendants
of
cypselus
this
was
the
origin
of
his
friendship
with
the
argives
on
account
of
which
a
thousand
of
them
were
brought
over
by
hegesistratus
and
fought
on
his
side
in
the
battle
at
pallene
some
authorities
say
that
this
marriage
took
place
after
his
first
expulsion
from
athens
others
while
he
was
in
possession
of
the
government
part
hippias
and
hipparchus
assumed
the
control
of
affairs
on
grounds
alike
of
standing
and
of
age
but
hippias
as
being
also
naturally
of
a
statesmanlike
and
shrewd
disposition
was
really
the
head
of
the
government
hipparchus
was
youthful
in
disposition
amorous
and
fond
of
literature
it
was
he
who
invited
to
athens
anacreon
simonides
and
the
other
poets
while
thessalus
was
much
junior
in
age
and
was
violent
and
headstrong
in
his
behaviour
it
was
from
his
character
that
all
the
evils
arose
which
befell
the
house
he
became
enamoured
of
harmodius
and
since
he
failed
to
win
his
affection
he
lost
all
restraint
upon
his
passion
and
in
addition
to
other
exhibitions
of
rage
he
finally
prevented
the
sister
of
harmodius
from
taking
the
part
of
a
in
the
panathenaic
procession
alleging
as
his
reason
that
harmodius
was
a
person
of
loose
life
thereupon
in
a
frenzy
of
wrath
harmodius
and
aristogeiton
did
their
celebrated
deed
in
conjunction
with
a
number
of
confederates
but
while
they
were
lying
in
wait
for
hippias
in
the
acropolis
at
the
time
of
the
panathenaea
hippias
at
this
moment
was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
procession
while
hipparchus
was
organizing
its
dispatch
they
saw
one
of
the
persons
privy
to
the
plot
talking
familiarly
with
him
thinking
that
he
was
betraying
them
and
desiring
to
do
something
before
they
were
arrested
they
rushed
down
and
made
their
attempt
without
waiting
for
the
rest
of
their
confederates
they
succeeded
in
killing
hipparchus
near
the
leocoreum
while
he
was
engaged
in
arranging
the
procession
but
ruined
the
design
as
a
whole
of
the
two
leaders
harmodius
was
killed
on
the
spot
by
the
guards
while
aristogeiton
was
arrested
and
perished
later
after
suffering
long
tortures
while
under
the
torture
he
accused
many
persons
who
belonged
by
birth
to
the
most
distinguished
families
and
were
also
personal
friends
of
the
tyrants
at
first
the
government
could
find
no
clue
to
the
conspiracy
for
the
current
story
that
hippias
made
all
who
were
taking
part
in
the
procession
leave
their
arms
and
then
detected
those
who
were
carrying
secret
daggers
can
not
be
true
since
at
that
time
they
did
not
bear
arms
in
the
processions
this
being
a
custom
instituted
at
a
later
period
by
the
democracy
according
to
the
story
of
the
popular
party
aristogeiton
accused
the
friends
of
the
tyrants
with
the
deliberate
intention
that
the
latter
might
commit
an
impious
act
and
at
the
same
time
weaken
themselves
by
putting
to
death
innocent
men
who
were
their
own
friends
others
say
that
he
told
no
falsehood
but
was
betraying
the
actual
accomplices
at
last
when
for
all
his
efforts
he
could
not
obtain
release
by
death
he
promised
to
give
further
information
against
a
number
of
other
persons
and
having
induced
hippias
to
give
him
his
hand
to
confirm
his
word
as
soon
as
he
had
hold
of
it
he
reviled
him
for
giving
his
hand
to
the
murderer
of
his
brother
till
hippias
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
lost
control
of
himself
and
snatched
out
his
dagger
and
dispatched
him
part
after
this
event
the
tyranny
became
much
harsher
in
consequence
of
his
vengeance
for
his
brother
and
of
the
execution
and
banishment
of
a
large
number
of
persons
hippias
became
a
distrusted
and
an
embittered
man
about
three
years
after
the
death
of
hipparchus
finding
his
position
in
the
city
insecure
he
set
about
fortifying
munichia
with
the
intention
of
establishing
himself
there
while
he
was
still
engaged
on
this
work
however
he
was
expelled
by
cleomenes
king
of
lacedaemon
in
consequence
of
the
spartans
being
continually
incited
by
oracles
to
overthrow
the
tyranny
these
oracles
were
obtained
in
the
following
way
the
athenian
exiles
headed
by
the
alcmeonidae
could
not
by
their
own
power
effect
their
return
but
failed
continually
in
their
attempts
among
their
other
failures
they
fortified
a
post
in
attica
lipsydrium
above
mt
parnes
and
were
there
joined
by
some
partisans
from
the
city
but
they
were
besieged
by
the
tyrants
and
reduced
to
surrender
after
this
disaster
the
following
became
a
popular
drinking
song
ah
lipsydrium
faithless
friend
lo
what
heroes
to
death
didst
send
nobly
born
and
great
in
deed
well
did
they
prove
themselves
at
need
of
noble
sires
a
noble
seed
having
failed
then
in
every
other
method
they
took
the
contract
for
rebuilding
the
temple
at
delphi
thereby
obtaining
ample
funds
which
they
employed
to
secure
the
help
of
the
lacedaemonians
all
this
time
the
pythia
kept
continually
enjoining
on
the
lacedaemonians
who
came
to
consult
the
oracle
that
they
must
free
athens
till
finally
she
succeeded
in
impelling
the
spartans
to
that
step
although
the
house
of
pisistratus
was
connected
with
them
by
ties
of
hospitality
the
resolution
of
the
lacedaemonians
was
however
at
least
equally
due
to
the
friendship
which
had
been
formed
between
the
house
of
pisistratus
and
argos
accordingly
they
first
sent
anchimolus
by
sea
at
the
head
of
an
army
but
he
was
defeated
and
killed
through
the
arrival
of
cineas
of
thessaly
to
support
the
sons
of
pisistratus
with
a
force
of
a
thousand
horsemen
then
being
roused
to
anger
by
this
disaster
they
sent
their
king
cleomenes
by
land
at
the
head
of
a
larger
force
and
he
after
defeating
the
thessalian
cavalry
when
they
attempted
to
intercept
his
march
into
attica
shut
up
hippias
within
what
was
known
as
the
pelargic
wall
and
blockaded
him
there
with
the
assistance
of
the
athenians
while
he
was
sitting
down
before
the
place
it
so
happened
that
the
sons
of
the
pisistratidae
were
captured
in
an
attempt
to
slip
out
upon
which
the
tyrants
capitulated
on
condition
of
the
safety
of
their
children
and
surrendered
the
acropolis
to
the
athenians
five
days
being
first
allowed
them
to
remove
their
effects
this
took
place
in
the
archonship
of
harpactides
after
they
had
held
the
tyranny
for
about
seventeen
years
since
their
father
death
or
in
all
including
the
period
of
their
father
rule
for
years
part
after
the
overthrow
of
the
tyranny
the
rival
leaders
in
the
state
were
isagoras
son
of
tisander
a
partisan
of
the
tyrants
and
cleisthenes
who
belonged
to
the
family
of
the
alcmeonidae
cleisthenes
being
beaten
in
the
political
clubs
called
in
the
people
by
giving
the
franchise
to
the
masses
thereupon
isagoras
finding
himself
left
inferior
in
power
invited
cleomenes
who
was
united
to
him
by
ties
of
hospitality
to
return
to
athens
and
persuaded
him
to
out
the
pollution
a
plea
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
alcmeonidae
were
suppposed
to
be
under
the
curse
of
pollution
on
this
cleisthenes
retired
from
the
country
and
cleomenes
entering
attica
with
a
small
force
expelled
as
polluted
seven
hundred
athenian
families
having
effected
this
he
next
attempted
to
dissolve
the
council
and
to
set
up
isagoras
and
three
hundred
of
his
partisans
as
the
supreme
power
in
the
state
the
council
however
resisted
the
populace
flocked
together
and
cleomenes
and
isagoras
with
their
adherents
took
refuge
in
the
acropolis
here
the
people
sat
down
and
besieged
them
for
two
days
and
on
the
third
they
agreed
to
let
cleomenes
and
all
his
followers
depart
while
they
summoned
cleisthenes
and
the
other
exiles
back
to
athens
when
the
people
had
thus
obtained
the
command
of
affairs
cleisthenes
was
their
chief
and
popular
leader
and
this
was
natural
for
the
alcmeonidae
were
perhaps
the
chief
cause
of
the
expulsion
of
the
tyrants
and
for
the
greater
part
of
their
rule
were
at
perpetual
war
with
them
but
even
earlier
than
the
attempts
of
the
alcmeonidae
one
cedon
made
an
attack
on
the
tyrants
when
there
came
another
popular
drinking
song
addressed
to
him
pour
a
health
yet
again
boy
to
cedon
forget
not
this
duty
to
do
if
a
health
is
an
honour
befitting
the
name
of
a
good
man
and
true
part
the
people
therefore
had
good
reason
to
place
confidence
in
cleisthenes
accordingly
now
that
he
was
the
popular
leader
three
years
after
the
expulsion
of
the
tyrants
in
the
archonship
of
isagoras
his
first
step
was
to
distribute
the
whole
population
into
ten
tribes
in
place
of
the
existing
four
with
the
object
of
intermixing
the
members
of
the
different
tribes
and
so
securing
that
more
persons
might
have
a
share
in
the
franchise
from
this
arose
the
saying
not
look
at
the
tribes
addressed
to
those
who
wished
to
scrutinize
the
lists
of
the
old
families
next
he
made
the
council
to
consist
of
five
hundred
members
instead
of
four
hundred
each
tribe
now
contributing
fifty
whereas
formerly
each
had
sent
a
hundred
the
reason
why
he
did
not
organize
the
people
into
twelve
tribes
was
that
he
might
not
have
to
use
the
existing
division
into
trittyes
for
the
four
tribes
had
twelve
trittyes
so
that
he
would
not
have
achieved
his
object
of
redistributing
the
population
in
fresh
combinations
further
he
divided
the
country
into
thirty
groups
of
demes
ten
from
the
districts
about
the
city
ten
from
the
coast
and
ten
from
the
interior
these
he
called
trittyes
and
he
assigned
three
of
them
by
lot
to
each
tribe
in
such
a
way
that
each
should
have
one
portion
in
each
of
these
three
localities
all
who
lived
in
any
given
deme
he
declared
to
the
end
that
the
new
citizens
might
not
be
exposed
by
the
habitual
use
of
family
names
but
that
men
might
be
officially
described
by
the
names
of
their
demes
and
accordingly
it
is
by
the
names
of
their
demes
that
the
athenians
speak
of
one
another
he
also
instituted
demarchs
who
had
the
same
duties
as
the
previously
existing
naucrari
the
demes
being
made
to
take
the
place
of
the
naucraries
he
gave
names
to
the
demes
some
from
the
localities
to
which
they
belonged
some
from
the
persons
who
founded
them
since
some
of
the
areas
no
longer
corresponded
to
localities
possessing
names
on
the
other
hand
he
allowed
every
one
to
retain
his
family
and
clan
and
religious
rites
according
to
ancestral
custom
the
names
given
to
the
tribes
were
the
ten
which
the
pythia
appointed
out
of
the
hundred
selected
national
heroes
part
by
these
reforms
the
constitution
became
much
more
democratic
than
that
of
solon
the
laws
of
solon
had
been
obliterated
by
disuse
during
the
period
of
the
tyranny
while
cleisthenes
substituted
new
ones
with
the
object
of
securing
the
goodwill
of
the
masses
among
these
was
the
law
concerning
ostracism
four
years
after
the
establishment
of
this
system
in
the
archonship
of
hermocreon
they
first
imposed
upon
the
council
of
five
hundred
the
oath
which
they
take
to
the
present
day
next
they
began
to
elect
the
generals
by
tribes
one
from
each
tribe
while
the
polemarch
was
the
commander
of
the
whole
army
then
eleven
years
later
in
the
archonship
of
phaenippus
they
won
the
battle
of
marathon
and
two
years
after
this
victory
when
the
people
had
now
gained
they
for
the
first
time
made
use
of
the
law
of
ostracism
this
had
originally
been
passed
as
a
precaution
against
men
in
high
office
because
pisistratus
took
advantage
of
his
position
as
a
popular
leader
and
general
to
make
himself
tyrant
and
the
first
person
ostracized
was
one
of
his
relatives
hipparchus
son
of
charmus
of
the
deme
of
collytus
the
very
person
on
whose
account
especially
cleisthenes
had
enacted
the
law
as
he
wished
to
get
rid
of
him
hitherto
however
he
had
escaped
for
the
athenians
with
the
usual
leniency
of
the
democracy
allowed
all
the
partisans
of
the
tyrants
who
had
not
joined
in
their
evil
deeds
in
the
time
of
the
troubles
to
remain
in
the
city
and
the
chief
and
leader
of
these
was
hipparchus
then
in
the
very
next
year
in
the
archonship
of
telesinus
they
for
the
first
time
since
the
tyranny
elected
tribe
by
tribe
the
nine
archons
by
lot
out
of
the
five
hundred
candidates
selected
by
the
demes
all
the
earlier
ones
having
been
elected
by
vote
and
in
the
same
year
megacles
son
of
hippocrates
of
the
deme
of
alopece
was
ostracized
thus
for
three
years
they
continued
to
ostracize
the
friends
of
the
tyrants
on
whose
account
the
law
had
been
passed
but
in
the
following
year
they
began
to
remove
others
as
well
including
any
one
who
seemed
to
be
more
powerful
than
was
expedient
the
first
person
unconnected
with
the
tyrants
who
was
ostracized
was
xanthippus
son
of
ariphron
two
years
later
in
the
archonship
of
nicodemus
the
mines
of
maroneia
were
discovered
and
the
state
made
a
profit
of
a
hundred
talents
from
the
working
of
them
some
persons
advised
the
people
to
make
a
distribution
of
the
money
among
themselves
but
this
was
prevented
by
themistocles
he
refused
to
say
on
what
he
proposed
to
spend
the
money
but
he
bade
them
lend
it
to
the
hundred
richest
men
in
athens
one
talent
to
each
and
then
if
the
manner
in
which
it
was
employed
pleased
the
people
the
expenditure
should
be
charged
to
the
state
but
otherwise
the
state
should
receive
the
sum
back
from
those
to
whom
it
was
lent
on
these
terms
he
received
the
money
and
with
it
he
had
a
hundred
triremes
built
each
of
the
hundred
individuals
building
one
and
it
was
with
these
ships
that
they
fought
the
battle
of
salamis
against
the
barbarians
about
this
time
aristides
the
son
of
lysimachus
was
ostracized
three
years
later
however
in
the
archonship
of
hypsichides
all
the
ostracized
persons
were
recalled
on
account
of
the
advance
of
the
army
of
xerxes
and
it
was
laid
down
for
the
future
that
persons
under
sentence
of
ostracism
must
live
between
geraestus
and
scyllaeum
on
pain
of
losing
their
civic
rights
irrevocably
part
so
far
then
had
the
city
progressed
by
this
time
growing
gradually
with
the
growth
of
the
democracy
but
after
the
persian
wars
the
council
of
areopagus
once
more
developed
strength
and
assumed
the
control
of
the
state
it
did
not
acquire
this
supremacy
by
virtue
of
any
formal
decree
but
because
it
had
been
the
cause
of
the
battle
of
salamis
being
fought
when
the
generals
were
utterly
at
a
loss
how
to
meet
the
crisis
and
made
proclamation
that
every
one
should
see
to
his
own
safety
the
areopagus
provided
a
donation
of
money
distributing
eight
drachmas
to
each
member
of
the
ships
crews
and
so
prevailed
on
them
to
go
on
board
on
these
grounds
people
bowed
to
its
prestige
and
during
this
period
athens
was
well
administered
at
this
time
they
devoted
themselves
to
the
prosecution
of
the
war
and
were
in
high
repute
among
the
greeks
so
that
the
command
by
sea
was
conferred
upon
them
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
lacedaemonians
the
leaders
of
the
people
during
this
period
were
aristides
of
lysimachus
and
themistocles
son
of
lysimachus
and
themistocles
son
of
neocles
of
whom
the
latter
appeared
to
devote
himself
to
the
conduct
of
war
while
the
former
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
clever
statesman
and
the
most
upright
man
of
his
time
accordingly
the
one
was
usually
employed
as
general
the
other
as
political
adviser
the
rebuilding
of
the
fortifications
they
conducted
in
combination
although
they
were
political
opponents
but
it
was
aristides
who
seizing
the
opportunity
afforded
by
the
discredit
brought
upon
the
lacedaemonians
by
pausanias
guided
the
public
policy
in
the
matter
of
the
defection
of
the
ionian
states
from
the
alliance
with
sparta
it
follows
that
it
was
he
who
made
the
first
assessment
of
tribute
from
the
various
allied
states
two
years
after
the
battle
of
salamis
in
the
archonship
of
timosthenes
and
it
was
he
who
took
the
oath
of
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
with
the
ionians
on
which
occasion
they
cast
the
masses
of
iron
into
the
sea
part
after
this
seeing
the
state
growing
in
confidence
and
much
wealth
accumulated
he
advised
the
people
to
lay
hold
of
the
leadership
of
the
league
and
to
quit
the
country
districts
and
settle
in
the
city
he
pointed
out
to
them
that
all
would
be
able
to
gain
a
living
there
some
by
service
in
the
army
others
in
the
garrisons
others
by
taking
a
part
in
public
affairs
and
in
this
way
they
would
secure
the
leadership
this
advice
was
taken
and
when
the
people
had
assumed
the
supreme
control
they
proceeded
to
treat
their
allies
in
a
more
imperious
fashion
with
the
exception
of
the
chians
lesbians
and
samians
these
they
maintained
to
protect
their
empire
leaving
their
constitutions
untouched
and
allowing
them
to
retain
whatever
dominion
they
then
possessed
they
also
secured
an
ample
maintenance
for
the
mass
of
the
population
in
the
way
which
aristides
had
pointed
out
to
them
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
tributes
and
the
taxes
and
the
contributions
of
the
allies
more
than
twenty
thousand
persons
were
maintained
there
were
jurymen
bowmen
knights
members
of
the
council
guards
of
the
dockyards
besides
fifty
guards
in
the
acropolis
there
were
some
magistrates
at
home
and
some
abroad
further
when
they
subsequently
went
to
war
there
were
in
addition
troops
twenty
and
other
ships
which
collected
the
tributes
with
crews
amounting
to
men
selected
by
lot
and
besides
these
there
were
the
persons
maintained
at
the
prytaneum
and
orphans
and
gaolers
since
all
these
were
supported
by
the
state
part
such
was
the
way
in
which
the
people
earned
their
livelihood
the
supremacy
of
the
areopagus
lasted
for
about
seventeen
years
after
the
persian
wars
although
gradually
declining
but
as
the
strength
of
the
masses
increased
ephialtes
son
of
sophonides
a
man
with
a
reputation
for
incorruptibility
and
public
virtue
who
had
become
the
leader
of
the
people
made
an
attack
upon
that
council
first
of
all
he
ruined
many
of
its
members
by
bringing
actions
against
them
with
reference
to
their
administration
then
in
the
archonship
of
conon
he
stripped
the
council
of
all
the
acquired
prerogatives
from
which
it
derived
its
guardianship
of
the
constitution
and
assigned
some
of
them
to
the
council
of
five
hundred
and
others
to
the
assembly
and
the
in
this
revolution
he
was
assisted
by
themistocles
who
was
himself
a
member
of
the
areopagus
but
was
expecting
to
be
tried
before
it
on
a
charge
of
treasonable
dealings
with
persia
this
made
him
anxious
that
it
should
be
overthrown
and
accordingly
he
warned
ephialtes
that
the
council
intended
to
arrest
him
while
at
the
same
time
he
informed
the
areopagites
that
he
would
reveal
to
them
certain
persons
who
were
conspiring
to
subvert
the
constitution
he
then
conducted
the
representatives
delegated
by
the
council
to
the
residence
of
ephialtes
promising
to
show
them
the
conspirators
who
assembled
there
and
proceeded
to
converse
with
them
in
an
earnest
manner
ephialtes
seeing
this
was
seized
with
alarm
and
took
refuge
in
suppliant
guise
at
the
altar
every
one
was
astounded
at
the
occurrence
and
presently
when
the
council
of
five
hundred
met
ephialtes
and
themistocles
together
proceeded
to
denounce
the
areopagus
to
them
this
they
repeated
in
similar
fashion
in
the
assembly
until
they
succeeded
in
depriving
it
of
its
power
not
long
afterwards
however
ephialtes
was
assassinated
by
aristodicus
of
tanagra
in
this
way
was
the
council
of
areopagus
deprived
of
its
guardianship
of
the
state
part
after
this
revolution
the
administration
of
the
state
became
more
and
more
lax
in
consequence
of
the
eager
rivalry
of
candidates
for
popular
favour
during
this
period
the
moderate
party
as
it
happened
had
no
real
chief
their
leader
being
cimon
son
of
miltiades
who
was
a
comparatively
young
man
and
had
been
late
in
entering
public
life
and
at
the
same
time
the
general
populace
suffered
great
losses
by
war
the
soldiers
for
active
service
were
selected
at
that
time
from
the
roll
of
citizens
and
as
the
generals
were
men
of
no
military
experience
who
owed
their
position
solely
to
their
family
standing
it
continually
happened
that
some
two
or
three
thousand
of
the
troops
perished
on
an
expedition
and
in
this
way
the
best
men
alike
of
the
lower
and
the
upper
classes
were
exhausted
consequently
in
most
matters
of
administration
less
heed
was
paid
to
the
laws
than
had
formerly
been
the
case
no
alteration
however
was
made
in
the
method
of
election
of
the
nine
archons
except
that
five
years
after
the
death
of
ephialtes
it
was
decided
that
the
candidates
to
be
submitted
to
the
lot
for
that
office
might
be
selected
from
the
zeugitae
as
well
as
from
the
higher
classes
the
first
archon
from
that
class
was
mnesitheides
up
to
this
time
all
the
archons
had
been
taken
from
the
pentacosiomedimni
and
knights
while
the
zeugitae
were
confined
to
the
ordinary
magistracies
save
where
an
evasion
of
the
law
was
overlooked
four
years
later
in
the
archonship
of
lysicrates
thirty
justices
as
they
as
they
were
called
were
and
two
years
afterwards
in
the
archonship
of
antidotus
consequence
of
the
great
increase
in
the
number
of
citizens
it
was
resolved
on
the
motion
of
pericles
that
no
one
should
be
admitted
to
the
franchise
who
was
not
of
citizen
birth
by
both
parents
part
after
this
pericles
came
forward
as
popular
leader
having
first
distinguished
himself
while
still
a
young
man
by
prosecuting
cimon
on
the
audit
of
his
official
accounts
as
general
under
his
auspices
the
constitution
became
still
more
democratic
he
took
away
some
of
the
privileges
of
the
areopagus
and
above
all
he
turned
the
policy
of
the
state
in
the
direction
of
sea
power
which
caused
the
masses
to
acquire
confidence
in
themselves
and
consequently
to
take
the
conduct
of
affairs
more
and
more
into
their
own
hands
moreover
years
after
the
battle
of
salamis
in
the
archonship
of
pythodorus
the
peloponnesian
war
broke
out
during
which
the
populace
was
shut
up
in
the
city
and
became
accustomed
to
gain
its
livelihood
by
military
service
and
so
partly
voluntarily
and
partly
involuntarily
determined
to
assume
the
administration
of
the
state
itself
pericles
was
also
the
first
to
institute
pay
for
service
in
the
as
a
bid
for
popular
favour
to
counterbalance
the
wealth
of
cimon
the
latter
having
private
possessions
on
a
regal
scale
not
only
performed
the
regular
public
services
magnificently
but
also
maintained
a
large
number
of
his
any
member
of
the
deme
of
laciadae
could
go
every
day
to
cimon
house
and
there
receive
a
reasonable
provision
while
his
estate
was
guarded
by
no
fences
so
that
any
one
who
liked
might
help
himself
to
the
fruit
from
it
pericles
private
property
was
quite
unequal
to
this
magnificence
and
accordingly
he
took
the
advice
of
damonides
of
oia
who
was
commonly
supposed
to
be
the
person
who
prompted
pericles
in
most
of
his
measures
and
was
therefore
subsequently
ostracized
which
was
that
as
he
was
beaten
in
the
matter
of
private
possessions
he
should
make
gifts
to
the
people
from
their
own
property
and
accordingly
he
instituted
pay
for
the
members
of
the
juries
some
critics
accuse
him
of
thereby
causing
a
deterioration
in
the
character
of
the
juries
since
it
was
always
the
common
people
who
put
themselves
forward
for
selection
as
jurors
rather
than
the
men
of
better
position
moreover
bribery
came
into
existence
after
this
the
first
person
to
introduce
it
being
anytus
after
his
command
at
pylos
he
was
prosecuted
by
certain
individuals
on
account
of
his
loss
of
pylos
but
escaped
by
bribing
the
jury
part
so
long
however
as
pericles
was
leader
of
the
people
things
went
tolerably
well
with
the
state
but
when
he
was
dead
there
was
a
great
change
for
the
worse
then
for
the
first
time
did
the
people
choose
a
leader
who
was
of
no
reputation
among
men
of
good
standing
whereas
up
to
this
time
such
men
had
always
been
found
as
leaders
of
the
democracy
the
first
leader
of
the
people
in
the
very
beginning
of
things
was
solon
and
the
second
was
pisistratus
both
of
them
men
of
birth
and
position
after
the
overthrow
of
the
tyrants
there
was
cleisthenes
a
member
of
the
house
of
the
alcmeonidae
and
he
had
no
rival
opposed
to
him
after
the
expulsion
of
the
party
of
isagoras
after
this
xanthippus
was
the
leader
of
the
people
and
miltiades
of
the
upper
class
then
came
themistocles
and
aristides
and
after
them
ephialtes
as
leader
of
the
people
and
cimon
son
of
miltiades
of
the
wealthier
class
pericles
followed
as
leader
of
the
people
and
thucydides
who
was
connected
by
marriage
with
cimon
of
the
opposition
after
the
death
of
pericles
nicias
who
subsequently
fell
in
sicily
appeared
as
leader
of
the
aristocracy
and
cleon
son
of
cleaenetus
of
the
people
the
latter
seems
more
than
any
one
else
to
have
been
the
cause
of
the
corruption
of
the
democracy
by
his
wild
undertakings
and
he
was
the
first
to
use
unseemly
shouting
and
coarse
abuse
on
the
bema
and
to
harangue
the
people
with
his
cloak
girt
up
short
about
him
whereas
all
his
predecessors
had
spoken
decently
and
in
order
these
were
succeeded
by
theramenes
son
of
hagnon
as
leader
of
the
one
party
and
the
cleophon
of
the
people
it
was
cleophon
who
first
granted
the
donation
for
the
theatrical
performances
and
for
some
time
it
continued
to
be
given
but
then
callicrates
of
paeania
ousted
him
by
promising
to
add
a
third
obol
to
the
sum
both
of
these
persons
were
subsequently
condemned
to
death
for
the
people
even
if
they
are
deceived
for
a
time
in
the
end
generally
come
to
detest
those
who
have
beguiled
them
into
any
unworthy
action
after
cleophon
the
popular
leadership
was
occupied
successively
by
the
men
who
chose
to
talk
the
biggest
and
pander
the
most
to
the
tastes
of
the
majority
with
their
eyes
fixed
only
on
the
interests
of
the
moment
the
best
statesmen
at
athens
after
those
of
early
times
seem
to
have
been
nicias
thucydides
and
theramenes
as
to
nicias
and
thucydides
nearly
every
one
agrees
that
they
were
not
merely
men
of
birth
and
character
but
also
statesmen
and
that
they
ruled
the
state
with
paternal
care
on
the
merits
of
theramenes
opinion
is
divided
because
it
so
happened
that
in
his
time
public
affairs
were
in
a
very
stormy
state
but
those
who
give
their
opinion
deliberately
find
him
not
as
his
critics
falsely
assert
overthrowing
every
kind
of
constitution
but
supporting
every
kind
so
long
as
it
did
not
transgress
laws
thus
showing
that
he
was
able
as
every
good
citizen
should
be
to
live
under
any
form
of
constitution
while
he
refused
to
countenance
illegality
and
was
its
constant
enemy
part
so
long
as
the
fortune
of
the
war
continued
even
the
athenians
preserved
the
democracy
but
after
the
disaster
in
sicily
when
the
lacedaemonians
had
gained
the
upper
hand
through
their
alliance
with
the
king
of
persia
they
were
compelled
to
abolish
the
democracy
and
establish
in
its
place
the
constitution
of
the
four
hundred
the
speech
recommending
this
course
before
the
vote
was
made
by
melobius
and
the
motion
was
proposed
by
pythodorus
of
anaphlystus
but
the
real
argument
which
persuaded
the
majority
was
the
belief
that
the
king
of
persia
was
more
likely
to
form
an
alliance
with
them
if
the
constitution
were
on
an
oligarchical
basis
the
motion
of
pythodorus
was
to
the
following
effect
the
popular
assembly
was
to
elect
twenty
persons
over
forty
years
of
age
who
in
conjunction
with
the
existing
ten
members
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
after
taking
an
oath
that
they
would
frame
such
measures
as
they
thought
best
for
the
state
should
then
prepare
proposals
for
the
public
safety
in
addition
any
other
person
might
make
proposals
so
that
of
all
the
schemes
before
them
the
people
might
choose
the
best
cleitophon
concurred
with
the
motion
of
pythodorus
but
moved
that
the
committee
should
also
investigate
the
ancient
laws
enacted
by
cleisthenes
when
he
created
the
democracy
in
order
that
they
might
have
these
too
before
them
and
so
be
in
a
position
to
decide
wisely
his
suggestion
being
that
the
constitution
of
cleisthenes
was
not
really
democratic
but
closely
akin
to
that
of
solon
when
the
committee
was
elected
their
first
proposal
was
that
the
prytanes
should
be
compelled
to
put
to
the
vote
any
motion
that
was
offered
on
behalf
of
the
public
safety
next
they
abolished
all
indictments
for
illegal
proposals
all
impeachments
and
pubic
prosecutions
in
order
that
every
athenian
should
be
free
to
give
his
counsel
on
the
situation
if
he
chose
and
they
decreed
that
if
any
person
imposed
a
fine
on
any
other
for
his
acts
in
this
respect
or
prosecuted
him
or
summoned
him
before
the
courts
he
should
on
an
information
being
laid
against
him
be
summarily
arrested
and
brought
before
the
generals
who
should
deliver
him
to
the
eleven
to
be
put
to
death
after
these
preliminary
measures
they
drew
up
the
constitution
in
the
following
manner
the
revenues
of
the
state
were
not
to
be
spent
on
any
purpose
except
the
war
all
magistrates
should
serve
without
remuneration
for
the
period
of
the
war
except
the
nine
archons
and
the
prytanes
for
the
time
being
who
should
each
receive
three
obols
a
day
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
administration
was
to
be
committed
for
the
period
of
the
war
to
those
athenians
who
were
most
capable
of
serving
the
state
personally
or
pecuniarily
to
the
number
of
not
less
than
five
thousand
this
body
was
to
have
full
powers
to
the
extent
even
of
making
treaties
with
whomsoever
they
willed
and
ten
representatives
over
forty
years
of
age
were
to
be
elected
from
each
tribe
to
draw
up
the
list
of
the
five
thousand
after
taking
an
oath
on
a
full
and
perfect
sacrifice
part
these
were
the
recommendations
of
the
committee
and
when
they
had
been
ratified
the
five
thousand
elected
from
their
own
number
a
hundred
commissioners
to
draw
up
the
constitution
they
on
their
appointment
drew
up
and
produced
the
following
recommendations
there
should
be
a
council
holding
office
for
a
year
consisting
of
men
over
thirty
years
of
age
serving
without
pay
to
this
body
should
belong
the
generals
the
nine
archons
the
amphictyonic
registrar
hieromnemon
the
taxiarchs
the
hipparchs
the
phylarch
the
commanders
of
garrisons
the
treasurers
of
athena
and
the
other
gods
ten
in
number
the
hellenic
treasurers
hellenotamiae
the
treasurers
of
the
other
moneys
to
the
number
of
twenty
the
ten
commissioners
of
sacrifices
hieropoei
and
the
ten
superintendents
of
the
mysteries
all
these
were
to
be
appointed
by
the
council
from
a
larger
number
of
selected
candidates
chosen
from
its
members
for
the
time
being
the
other
offices
were
all
to
be
filled
by
lot
and
not
from
the
members
of
the
council
the
hellenic
treasurers
who
actually
administered
the
funds
should
not
sit
with
the
council
as
regards
the
future
four
councils
were
to
be
created
of
men
of
the
age
already
mentioned
and
one
of
these
was
to
be
chosen
by
lot
to
take
office
at
once
while
the
others
were
to
receive
it
in
turn
in
the
order
decided
by
the
lot
for
this
purpose
the
hundred
commissioners
were
to
distribute
themselves
and
all
the
rest
as
equally
as
possible
into
four
parts
and
cast
lots
for
precedence
and
the
selected
body
should
hold
office
for
a
year
they
were
to
administer
that
office
as
seemed
to
them
best
both
with
reference
to
the
safe
custody
and
due
expenditure
of
the
finances
and
generally
with
regard
to
all
other
matters
to
the
best
of
their
ability
if
they
desired
to
take
a
larger
number
of
persons
into
counsel
each
member
might
call
in
one
assistant
of
his
own
choice
subject
to
the
same
qualification
of
age
the
council
was
to
sit
once
every
five
days
unless
there
was
any
special
need
for
more
frequent
sittings
the
casting
of
the
lot
for
the
council
was
to
be
held
by
the
nine
archons
votes
on
divisions
were
to
be
counted
by
five
tellers
chosen
by
lot
from
the
members
of
the
council
and
of
these
one
was
to
be
selected
by
lot
every
day
to
act
as
president
these
five
persons
were
to
cast
lots
for
precedence
between
the
parties
wishing
to
appear
before
the
council
giving
the
first
place
to
sacred
matters
the
second
to
heralds
the
third
to
embassies
and
the
fourth
to
all
other
subjects
but
matters
concerning
the
war
might
be
dealt
with
on
the
motion
of
the
generals
whenever
there
was
need
without
balloting
any
member
of
the
council
who
did
not
enter
the
at
the
time
named
should
be
fined
a
drachma
for
each
day
unless
he
was
away
on
leave
of
absence
from
the
council
part
such
was
the
constitution
which
they
drew
up
for
the
time
to
come
but
for
the
immediate
present
they
devised
the
following
scheme
there
should
be
a
council
of
four
hundred
as
in
the
ancient
constitution
forty
from
each
tribe
chosen
out
of
candidates
of
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
selected
by
the
members
of
the
tribes
this
council
should
appoint
the
magistrates
and
draw
up
the
form
of
oath
which
they
were
to
take
and
in
all
that
concerned
the
laws
in
the
examination
of
official
accounts
and
in
other
matters
generally
they
might
act
according
to
their
discretion
they
must
however
observe
the
laws
that
might
be
enacted
with
reference
to
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
had
no
power
to
alter
them
nor
to
pass
others
the
generals
should
be
provisionally
elected
from
the
whole
body
of
the
five
thousand
but
so
soon
as
the
council
came
into
existence
it
was
to
hold
an
examination
of
military
equipments
and
thereon
elect
ten
persons
together
with
a
secretary
and
the
persons
thus
elected
should
hold
office
during
the
coming
year
with
full
powers
and
should
have
the
right
whenever
they
desired
it
of
joining
in
the
deliberations
of
the
council
the
five
thousand
was
also
to
elect
a
single
hipparch
and
ten
phylarchs
but
for
the
future
the
council
was
to
elect
these
officers
according
to
the
regulations
above
laid
down
no
office
except
those
of
member
of
the
council
and
of
general
might
be
held
more
than
once
either
by
the
first
occupants
or
by
their
successors
with
reference
to
the
future
distribution
of
the
four
hundred
into
the
four
successive
sections
the
hundred
commissioners
must
divide
them
whenever
the
time
comes
for
the
citizens
to
join
in
the
council
along
with
the
rest
part
the
hundred
commissioners
appointed
by
the
five
thousand
drew
up
the
constitution
as
just
stated
and
after
it
had
been
ratified
by
the
people
under
the
presidency
of
aristomachus
the
existing
council
that
of
the
year
of
callias
was
dissolved
before
it
had
completed
its
term
of
office
it
was
dissolved
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
thargelion
and
the
four
hundred
entered
into
office
on
the
whereas
the
regular
council
elected
by
lot
ought
to
have
entered
into
office
on
the
fourteenth
of
scirophorion
thus
was
the
oligarchy
established
in
the
archonship
of
callias
just
about
a
hundred
years
after
the
expulsion
of
the
tyrants
the
chief
promoters
of
the
revolution
were
pisander
antiphon
and
theramenes
all
of
them
men
of
good
birth
and
with
high
reputations
for
ability
and
judgement
when
however
this
constitution
had
been
established
the
five
thousand
were
only
nominally
selected
and
the
four
hundred
together
with
the
ten
officers
on
whom
full
powers
had
been
conferred
occupied
the
and
really
administered
the
government
they
began
by
sending
ambassadors
to
the
lacedaemonians
proposing
a
cessation
of
the
war
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
position
but
as
the
lacedaemonians
refused
to
listen
to
them
unless
they
would
also
abandon
the
command
of
the
sea
they
broke
off
the
negotiations
part
for
about
four
months
the
constitution
of
the
four
hundred
lasted
and
mnasilochus
held
office
as
archon
of
their
nomination
for
two
months
of
the
year
of
theopompus
who
was
archon
for
the
remaining
ten
on
the
loss
of
the
naval
battle
of
eretria
however
and
the
revolt
of
the
whole
of
euboea
except
oreum
the
indignation
of
the
people
was
greater
than
at
any
of
the
earlier
disasters
since
they
drew
far
more
supplies
at
this
time
from
euboea
than
from
attica
itself
accordingly
they
deposed
the
four
hundred
and
committed
the
management
of
affairs
to
the
five
thousand
consisting
of
persons
possessing
a
military
equipment
at
the
same
time
they
voted
that
pay
should
not
be
given
for
any
public
office
the
persons
chiefly
responsible
for
the
revolution
were
aristocrates
and
theramenes
who
disapproved
of
the
action
of
the
four
hundred
in
retaining
the
direction
of
affairs
entirely
in
their
own
hands
and
referring
nothing
to
the
five
thousand
during
this
period
the
constitution
of
the
state
seems
to
have
been
admirable
since
it
was
a
time
of
war
and
the
franchise
was
in
the
hands
of
those
who
possessed
a
military
equipment
part
the
people
however
in
a
very
short
time
deprived
the
five
thousand
of
their
monopoly
of
the
government
then
six
years
after
the
overthrow
of
the
four
hundred
in
the
archonship
of
callias
of
angele
the
battle
of
arginusae
took
place
of
which
the
results
were
first
that
the
ten
generals
who
had
gained
the
victory
were
all
condemned
by
a
single
decision
owing
to
the
people
being
led
astray
by
persons
who
aroused
their
indignation
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
some
of
the
generals
had
actually
taken
no
part
in
the
battle
and
others
were
themselves
picked
up
by
other
vessels
secondly
when
the
lacedaemonians
proposed
to
evacuate
decelea
and
make
peace
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
position
although
some
of
the
athenians
supported
this
proposal
the
majority
refused
to
listen
to
them
in
this
they
were
led
astray
by
cleophon
who
appeared
in
the
assembly
drunk
and
wearing
his
breastplate
and
prevented
peace
being
made
declaring
that
he
would
never
accept
peace
unless
the
lacedaemonians
abandoned
their
claims
on
all
the
cities
allied
with
them
they
mismanaged
their
opportunity
then
and
in
a
very
short
time
they
learnt
their
mistake
the
next
year
in
the
archonship
of
alexias
they
suffered
the
disaster
of
aegospotami
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
lysander
became
master
of
the
city
and
set
up
the
thirty
as
its
governors
he
did
so
in
the
following
manner
one
of
the
terms
of
peace
stipulated
that
the
state
should
be
governed
according
to
ancient
constitution
accordingly
the
popular
party
tried
to
preserve
the
democracy
while
that
part
of
the
upper
class
which
belonged
to
the
political
clubs
together
with
the
exiles
who
had
returned
since
the
peace
aimed
at
an
oligarchy
and
those
who
were
not
members
of
any
club
though
in
other
respects
they
considered
themselves
as
good
as
any
other
citizens
were
anxious
to
restore
the
ancient
constitution
the
latter
class
included
archinus
anytus
cleitophon
phormisius
and
many
others
but
their
most
prominent
leader
was
theramenes
lysander
however
threw
his
influence
on
the
side
of
the
oligarchical
party
and
the
popular
assembly
was
compelled
by
sheer
intimidation
to
pass
a
vote
establishing
the
oligarchy
the
motion
to
this
effect
was
proposed
by
dracontides
of
aphidna
part
in
this
way
were
the
thirty
established
in
power
in
the
archonship
of
pythodorus
as
soon
however
as
they
were
masters
of
the
city
they
ignored
all
the
resolutions
which
had
been
passed
relating
to
the
organization
of
the
constitution
but
after
appointing
a
council
of
five
hundred
and
the
other
magistrates
out
of
a
thousand
selected
candidates
and
associating
with
themselves
ten
archons
in
piraeus
eleven
superintendents
of
the
prison
and
three
hundred
as
attendants
with
the
help
of
these
they
kept
the
city
under
their
own
control
at
first
indeed
they
behaved
with
moderation
towards
the
citizens
and
pretended
to
administer
the
state
according
to
the
ancient
constitution
in
pursuance
of
this
policy
they
took
down
from
the
hill
of
areopagus
the
laws
of
ephialtes
and
archestratus
relating
to
the
areopagite
council
they
also
repealed
such
of
the
statutes
of
solon
as
were
obscure
and
abolished
the
supreme
power
of
the
in
this
they
claimed
to
be
restoring
the
constitution
and
freeing
it
from
obscurities
as
for
instance
by
making
the
testator
free
once
for
all
to
leave
his
property
as
he
pleased
and
abolishing
the
existing
limitations
in
cases
of
insanity
old
age
and
undue
female
influence
in
order
that
no
opening
might
be
left
for
professional
accusers
in
other
matters
also
their
conduct
was
similar
at
first
then
they
acted
on
these
lines
and
they
destroyed
the
professional
accusers
and
those
mischievous
and
persons
who
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
democracy
had
attached
themselves
to
it
in
order
to
curry
favour
with
it
with
all
of
this
the
city
was
much
pleased
and
thought
that
the
thirty
were
doing
it
with
the
best
of
motives
but
so
soon
as
they
had
got
a
firmer
hold
on
the
city
they
spared
no
class
of
citizens
but
put
to
death
any
persons
who
were
eminent
for
wealth
or
birth
or
character
herein
they
aimed
at
removing
all
whom
they
had
reason
to
fear
while
they
also
wished
to
lay
hands
on
their
possessions
and
in
a
short
time
they
put
to
death
not
less
than
fifteen
hundred
persons
part
theramenes
however
seeing
the
city
thus
falling
into
ruin
was
displeased
with
their
proceedings
and
counselled
them
to
cease
such
unprincipled
conduct
and
let
the
better
classes
have
a
share
in
the
government
at
first
they
resisted
his
advice
but
when
his
proposals
came
to
be
known
abroad
and
the
masses
began
to
associate
themselves
with
him
they
were
seized
with
alarm
lest
he
should
make
himself
the
leader
of
the
people
and
destroy
their
despotic
power
accordingly
they
drew
up
a
list
of
three
thousand
citizens
to
whom
they
announced
that
they
would
give
a
share
in
the
constitution
theramenes
however
criticized
this
scheme
also
first
on
the
ground
that
while
proposing
to
give
all
respectable
citizens
a
share
in
the
constitution
they
were
actually
giving
it
only
to
three
thousand
persons
as
though
all
merit
were
confined
within
that
number
and
secondly
because
they
were
doing
two
inconsistent
things
since
they
made
the
government
rest
on
the
basis
of
force
and
yet
made
the
governors
inferior
in
strength
to
the
governed
however
they
took
no
notice
of
his
criticisms
and
for
a
long
time
put
off
the
publication
of
the
list
of
the
three
thousand
and
kept
to
themselves
the
names
of
those
who
had
been
placed
upon
it
and
every
time
they
did
decide
to
publish
it
they
proceeded
to
strike
out
some
of
those
who
had
been
included
in
it
and
insert
others
who
had
been
omitted
part
now
when
winter
had
set
in
thrasybulus
and
the
exiles
occupied
phyle
and
the
force
which
the
thirty
led
out
to
attack
them
met
with
a
reverse
thereupon
the
thirty
decided
to
disarm
the
bulk
of
the
population
and
to
get
rid
of
theramenes
which
they
did
in
the
following
way
they
introduced
two
laws
into
the
council
which
they
commanded
it
to
pass
the
first
of
them
gave
the
thirty
absolute
power
to
put
to
death
any
citizen
who
was
not
included
in
the
list
of
the
three
thousand
while
the
second
disqualified
all
persons
from
participation
in
the
franchise
who
should
have
assisted
in
the
demolition
of
the
fort
of
eetioneia
or
have
acted
in
any
way
against
the
four
hundred
who
had
organized
the
previous
oligarchy
theramenes
had
done
both
and
accordingly
when
these
laws
were
ratified
he
became
excluded
from
the
franchise
and
the
thirty
had
full
power
to
put
him
to
death
theramenes
having
been
thus
removed
they
disarmed
all
the
people
except
the
three
thousand
and
in
every
respect
showed
a
great
advance
in
cruelty
and
crime
they
also
sent
ambassadors
to
lacedaemonian
to
blacken
the
character
of
theramenes
and
to
ask
for
help
and
the
lacedaemonians
in
answer
to
their
appeal
sent
callibius
as
military
governor
with
about
seven
hundred
troops
who
came
and
occupied
the
acropolis
part
these
events
were
followed
by
the
occupation
of
munichia
by
the
exiles
from
phyle
and
their
victory
over
the
thirty
and
their
partisans
after
the
fight
the
party
of
the
city
retreated
and
next
day
they
held
a
meeting
in
the
marketplace
and
deposed
the
thirty
and
elected
ten
citizens
with
full
powers
to
bring
the
war
to
a
termination
when
however
the
ten
had
taken
over
the
government
they
did
nothing
towards
the
object
for
which
they
were
elected
but
sent
envoys
to
lacedaemonian
to
ask
for
help
and
to
borrow
money
further
finding
that
the
citizens
who
possessed
the
franchise
were
displeased
at
their
proceedings
they
were
afraid
lest
they
should
be
deposed
and
consequently
in
order
to
strike
terror
into
them
in
which
design
they
succeeded
they
arrested
demaretus
one
of
the
most
eminent
citizens
and
put
him
to
death
this
gave
them
a
firm
hold
on
the
government
and
they
also
had
the
support
of
callibius
and
his
peloponnesians
together
with
several
of
the
knights
for
some
of
the
members
of
this
class
were
the
most
zealous
among
the
citizens
to
prevent
the
return
of
the
exiles
from
phyle
when
however
the
party
in
piraeus
and
munichia
began
to
gain
the
upper
hand
in
the
war
through
the
defection
of
the
whole
populace
to
them
the
party
in
the
city
deposed
the
original
ten
and
elected
another
ten
consisting
of
men
of
the
highest
repute
under
their
administration
and
with
their
active
and
zealous
cooperation
the
treaty
of
reconciliation
was
made
and
the
populace
returned
to
the
city
the
most
prominent
members
of
this
board
were
rhinon
of
paeania
and
phayllus
of
acherdus
who
even
before
the
arrival
of
pausanias
opened
negotiations
with
the
party
in
piraeus
and
after
his
arrival
seconded
his
efforts
to
bring
about
the
return
of
the
exiles
for
it
was
pausanias
the
king
of
the
lacedaemonians
who
brought
the
peace
and
reconciliation
to
a
fulfillment
in
conjunction
with
the
ten
commissioners
of
arbitration
who
arrived
later
from
lacedaemonian
at
his
own
earnest
request
rhinon
and
his
colleagues
received
a
vote
of
thanks
for
the
goodwill
shown
by
them
to
the
people
and
though
they
received
their
charge
under
an
oligarchy
and
handed
in
their
accounts
under
a
democracy
no
one
either
of
the
party
that
had
stayed
in
the
city
or
of
the
exiles
that
had
returned
from
the
piraeus
brought
any
complaint
against
them
on
the
contrary
rhinon
was
immediately
elected
general
on
account
of
his
conduct
in
this
office
part
this
reconciliation
was
effected
in
the
archonship
of
eucleides
on
the
following
terms
all
persons
who
having
remained
in
the
city
during
the
troubles
were
now
anxious
to
leave
it
were
to
be
free
to
settle
at
eleusis
retaining
their
civil
rights
and
possessing
full
and
independent
powers
of
and
with
the
free
enjoyment
of
their
own
personal
property
the
temple
at
eleusis
should
be
common
ground
for
both
parties
and
should
be
under
the
superintendence
of
the
ceryces
and
the
eumolpidae
according
to
primitive
custom
the
settlers
at
eleusis
should
not
be
allowed
to
enter
athens
nor
the
people
of
athens
to
enter
eleusis
except
at
the
season
of
the
mysteries
when
both
parties
should
be
free
from
these
restrictions
the
secessionists
should
pay
their
share
to
the
fund
for
the
common
defence
out
of
their
revenues
just
like
all
the
other
athenians
if
any
of
the
seceding
party
wished
to
take
a
house
in
eleusis
the
people
would
help
them
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
owner
but
if
they
could
not
come
to
terms
they
should
appoint
three
valuers
on
either
side
and
the
owner
should
receive
whatever
price
they
should
appoint
of
the
inhabitants
of
eleusis
those
whom
the
secessionists
wished
to
remain
should
be
allowed
to
do
so
the
list
of
those
who
desired
to
secede
should
be
made
up
within
ten
days
after
the
taking
of
the
oaths
in
the
case
of
persons
already
in
the
country
and
their
actual
departure
should
take
place
within
twenty
days
persons
at
present
out
of
the
country
should
have
the
same
terms
allowed
to
them
after
their
return
no
one
who
settled
at
eleusis
should
be
capable
of
holding
any
office
in
athens
until
he
should
again
register
himself
on
the
roll
as
a
resident
in
the
city
trials
for
homicide
including
all
cases
in
which
one
party
had
either
killed
or
wounded
another
should
be
conducted
according
to
ancestral
practice
there
should
be
a
general
amnesty
concerning
past
events
towards
all
persons
except
the
thirty
the
ten
the
eleven
and
the
magistrates
in
piraeus
and
these
too
should
be
included
if
they
should
submit
their
accounts
in
the
usual
way
such
accounts
should
be
given
by
the
magistrates
in
piraeus
before
a
court
of
citizens
rated
in
piraeus
and
by
the
magistrates
in
the
city
before
a
court
of
those
rated
in
the
city
on
these
terms
those
who
wished
to
do
so
might
secede
each
party
was
to
repay
separately
the
money
which
it
had
borrowed
for
the
war
part
when
the
reconciliation
had
taken
place
on
these
terms
those
who
had
fought
on
the
side
of
the
thirty
felt
considerable
apprehensions
and
a
large
number
intended
to
secede
but
as
they
put
off
entering
their
names
till
the
last
moment
as
people
will
do
archinus
observing
their
numbers
and
being
anxious
to
retain
them
as
citizens
cut
off
the
remaining
days
during
which
the
list
should
have
remained
open
and
in
this
way
many
persons
were
compelled
to
remain
though
they
did
so
very
unwillingly
until
they
recovered
confidence
this
is
one
point
in
which
archinus
appears
to
have
acted
in
a
most
statesmanlike
manner
and
another
was
his
subsequent
prosecution
of
thrasybulus
on
the
charge
of
illegality
for
a
motion
by
which
he
proposed
to
confer
the
franchise
on
all
who
had
taken
part
in
the
return
from
piraeus
although
some
of
them
were
notoriously
slaves
and
yet
a
third
such
action
was
when
one
of
the
returned
exiles
began
to
violate
the
amnesty
whereupon
archinus
haled
him
to
the
council
and
persuaded
them
to
execute
him
without
trial
telling
them
that
now
they
would
have
to
show
whether
they
wished
to
preserve
the
democracy
and
abide
by
the
oaths
they
had
taken
for
if
they
let
this
man
escape
they
would
encourage
others
to
imitate
him
while
if
they
executed
him
they
would
make
an
example
for
all
to
learn
by
and
this
was
exactly
what
happened
for
after
this
man
had
been
put
to
death
no
one
ever
again
broke
the
amnesty
on
the
contrary
the
athenians
seem
both
in
public
and
in
private
to
have
behaved
in
the
most
unprecedentedly
admirable
and
way
with
reference
to
the
preceding
troubles
not
only
did
they
blot
out
all
memory
of
former
offences
but
they
even
repaid
to
the
lacedaemonians
out
of
the
public
purse
the
money
which
the
thirty
had
borrowed
for
the
war
although
the
treaty
required
each
party
the
party
of
the
city
and
the
party
of
piraeus
to
pay
its
own
debts
separately
this
they
did
because
they
thought
it
was
a
necessary
first
step
in
the
direction
of
restoring
harmony
but
in
other
states
so
far
from
the
democratic
parties
making
advances
from
their
own
possessions
they
are
rather
in
the
habit
of
making
a
general
redistribution
of
the
land
a
final
reconciliation
was
made
with
the
secessionists
at
eleusis
two
years
after
the
secession
in
the
archonship
of
xenaenetus
part
this
however
took
place
at
a
later
date
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
people
having
secured
the
control
of
the
state
established
the
constitution
which
exists
at
the
present
day
pythodorus
was
archon
at
the
time
but
the
democracy
seems
to
have
assumed
the
supreme
power
with
perfect
justice
since
it
had
effected
its
own
return
by
its
own
exertions
this
was
the
eleventh
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
constitution
of
athens
the
first
modification
of
the
primaeval
condition
of
things
was
when
ion
and
his
companions
brought
the
people
together
into
a
community
for
then
the
people
was
first
divided
into
the
four
tribes
and
the
were
created
next
and
first
after
this
having
now
some
semblance
of
a
constitution
was
that
which
took
place
in
the
reign
of
theseus
consisting
in
a
slight
deviation
from
absolute
monarchy
after
this
came
the
constitution
formed
under
draco
when
the
first
code
of
laws
was
drawn
up
the
third
was
that
which
followed
the
civil
war
in
the
time
of
solon
from
this
the
democracy
took
its
rise
the
fourth
was
the
tyranny
of
pisistratus
the
fifth
the
constitution
of
cleisthenes
after
the
overthrow
of
the
tyrants
of
a
more
democratic
character
than
that
of
solon
the
sixth
was
that
which
followed
on
the
persian
wars
when
the
council
of
areopagus
had
the
direction
of
the
state
the
seventh
succeeding
this
was
the
constitution
which
aristides
sketched
out
and
which
ephialtes
brought
to
completion
by
overthrowing
the
areopagite
council
under
this
the
nation
misled
by
the
demagogues
made
the
most
serious
mistakes
in
the
interest
of
its
maritime
empire
the
eighth
was
the
establishment
of
the
four
hundred
followed
by
the
ninth
the
restored
democracy
the
tenth
was
the
tyranny
of
the
thirty
and
the
ten
the
eleventh
was
that
which
followed
the
return
from
phyle
and
piraeus
and
this
has
continued
from
that
day
to
this
with
continual
accretions
of
power
to
the
masses
the
democracy
has
made
itself
master
of
everything
and
administers
everything
by
its
votes
in
the
assembly
and
by
the
in
which
it
holds
the
supreme
power
even
the
jurisdiction
of
the
council
has
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
people
at
large
and
this
appears
to
be
a
judicious
change
since
small
bodies
are
more
open
to
corruption
whether
by
actual
money
or
influence
than
large
ones
at
first
they
refused
to
allow
payment
for
attendance
at
the
assembly
but
the
result
was
that
people
did
not
attend
consequently
after
the
prytanes
had
tried
many
devices
in
vain
in
order
to
induce
the
populace
to
come
and
ratify
the
votes
agyrrhius
in
the
first
instance
made
a
provision
of
one
obol
a
day
which
heracleides
of
clazomenae
nicknamed
king
increased
to
two
obols
and
agyrrhius
again
to
three
part
the
present
state
of
the
constitution
is
as
follows
the
franchise
is
open
to
all
who
are
of
citizen
birth
by
both
parents
they
are
enrolled
among
the
demesmen
at
the
age
of
eighteen
on
the
occasion
of
their
enrollment
the
demesmen
give
their
votes
on
oath
first
whether
the
candidates
appear
to
be
of
the
age
prescribed
by
the
law
if
not
they
are
dismissed
back
into
the
ranks
of
the
boys
and
secondly
whether
the
candidate
is
free
born
and
of
such
parentage
as
the
laws
require
then
if
they
decide
that
he
is
not
a
free
man
he
appeals
to
the
and
the
demesmen
appoint
five
of
their
own
number
to
act
as
accusers
if
the
court
decides
that
he
has
no
right
to
be
enrolled
he
is
sold
by
the
state
as
a
slave
but
if
he
wins
his
case
he
has
a
right
to
be
enrolled
among
the
demesmen
without
further
question
after
this
the
council
examines
those
who
have
been
enrolled
and
if
it
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
any
of
them
is
less
than
eighteen
years
of
age
it
fines
the
demesmen
who
enrolled
him
when
the
youths
ephebi
have
passed
this
examination
their
fathers
meet
by
their
tribes
and
appoint
on
oath
three
of
their
fellow
tribesmen
over
forty
years
of
age
who
in
their
opinion
are
the
best
and
most
suitable
persons
to
have
charge
of
the
youths
and
of
these
the
assembly
elects
one
from
each
tribe
as
guardian
together
with
a
director
chosen
from
the
general
body
of
athenians
to
control
the
while
under
the
charge
of
these
persons
the
youths
first
of
all
make
the
circuit
of
the
temples
then
they
proceed
to
piraeus
and
some
of
them
garrison
munichia
and
some
the
south
shore
the
assembly
also
elects
two
trainers
with
subordinate
instructors
who
teach
them
to
fight
in
heavy
armour
to
use
the
bow
and
javelin
and
to
discharge
a
catapult
the
guardians
receive
from
the
state
a
drachma
apiece
for
their
keep
and
the
youths
four
obols
apiece
each
guardian
receives
the
allowance
for
all
the
members
of
his
tribe
and
buys
the
necessary
provisions
for
the
common
stock
they
mess
together
by
tribes
and
generally
superintends
everything
in
this
way
they
spend
the
first
year
the
next
year
after
giving
a
public
display
of
their
military
evolutions
on
the
occasion
when
the
assembly
meets
in
the
theatre
they
receive
a
shield
and
spear
from
the
state
after
which
they
patrol
the
country
and
spend
their
time
in
the
forts
for
these
two
years
they
are
on
garrison
duty
and
wear
the
military
cloak
and
during
this
time
they
are
exempt
from
all
taxes
they
also
can
neither
bring
an
action
at
law
nor
have
one
brought
against
them
in
order
that
they
may
have
no
excuse
for
requiring
leave
of
absence
though
exception
is
made
in
cases
of
actions
concerning
inheritances
and
wards
of
state
or
of
any
sacrificial
ceremony
connected
with
the
family
when
the
two
years
have
elapsed
they
thereupon
take
their
position
among
the
other
citizens
such
is
the
manner
of
the
enrollment
of
the
citizens
and
the
training
of
the
youths
part
all
the
magistrates
that
are
concerned
with
the
ordinary
routine
of
administration
are
elected
by
lot
except
the
military
treasurer
the
commissioners
of
the
theoric
fund
and
the
superintendent
of
springs
these
are
elected
by
vote
and
hold
office
from
one
panathenaic
festival
to
the
next
all
military
officers
are
also
elected
by
vote
the
council
of
five
hundred
is
elected
by
lot
fifty
from
each
tribe
each
tribe
holds
the
office
of
prytanes
in
turn
the
order
being
determined
by

the
first
four
serve
for
days
each
the
last
six
for
since
the
reckoning
is
by
lunar
years
the
prytanes
for
the
time
being
in
the
first
place
mess
together
in
the
tholus
and
receive
a
sum
of
money
from
the
state
for
their
maintenance
and
secondly
they
convene
the
meetings
of

and
the

the

they
convene
every

unless
it
is
a

the

four
times
in
each

it
is
also
their
duty
to
draw
up
the
programme
of
the
business
of
the

and
to
decide
what
subjects
are
to
be
dealt
with
on
each
particular
day
and
where
the
sitting
is
to
be
held
they
also
draw
up
the
programme
for
the
meetings
of
the
assembly
one
of
these
in
each
prytany
is
called
the
assembly
in
this
the
people
have
to
ratify
the
continuance
of
the
magistrates
in
office
if
they
are
performing
their
duties
properly
and
to
consider
the
supply
of
corn
and
the
defence
of
the
country
on
this
day
too
impeachments
are
introduced
by
those
who
wish
to
do
so
the
lists
of
property
confiscated
by
the
state
are
read
and
also
applications
for
inheritances
and
wards
of

so
that
nothing
may
pass
unclaimed
without
the
cognizance
of
any
person
concerned
in
the
sixth
prytany
in
addition
to
the
business
already
stated
the
question
is
put
to
the
vote
whether
it
is
desirable
to
hold
a
vote
of
ostracism
or
not
and
complaints
against
professional
accusers
whether
athenian
or
aliens
domiciled
in
athens
are
received
to
the
number
of
not
more
than
three
of
either
class
together
with
cases
in
which
an
individual
has
made
some
promise
to
the

and
has
not
performed

to
the
people
concerning
any
matter
public
or
private
the
two
remaining
meetings
are
devoted
to
all
other
subjects
and
the
laws
require
them
to
deal
with
three
questions
connected
with
religion
three
connected
with
heralds
and
embassies
and
three
on
secular
subjects
sometimes
questions
are
brought
forward
without
a
preliminary
vote
of
the
assembly
to
take
them
into
consideration
heralds
and
envoys
appear
first
before
the
prytanes
and
the
bearers
of
dispatches
also

and
a
day
he
may
not

elections
to
the
offices
of
general
and
hipparch
and
all
other
military
commands
are
held
in
the
assembly
in
such
manner
as
the
people
decide
they
are
held
after
the
sixth
prytany
by
the
first
board
of
prytanes
in
whose
term
of
office
the
omens
are
favourable
there
has
however
to
be
a
preliminary
consideration
by
the
council
in
this
case
also
part
in
former
times
the
council
had
full
powers
to
inflict
fines
and
imprisonment
and
death
but
when
it
had
consigned
lysimachus
to
the
executioner
and
he
was
sitting
in
the
immediate
expectation
of
death
eumelides
of
alopece
rescued
him
from
its
hands
maintaining
that
no
citizen
ought
to
be
put
to
death
except
on
the
decision
of
a
court
of
law
accordingly
a
trial
was
held
in
a
and
lysimachus
was
acquitted
receiving
henceforth
the
nickname
of
man
from
the
and
the
people
deprived
the
council
thenceforward
of
the
power
to
inflict
death
or
imprisonment
or
fine
passing
a
law
that
if
the
council
condemn
any
person
for
an
offence
or
inflict
a
fine
the
thesmothetae
shall
bring
the
sentence
or
fine
before
the
and
the
decision
of
the
jurors
shall
be
the
final
judgement
in
the
matter
the
council
passes
judgement
on
nearly
all
magistrates
especially
those
who
have
the
control
of
money
its
judgement
however
is
not
final
but
is
subject
to
an
appeal
to
the
lawcourts
private
individuals
also
may
lay
an
information
against
any
magistrate
they
please
for
not
obeying
the
laws
but
here
too
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
if
the
council
declare
the
charge
proved
the
council
also
examines
those
who
are
to
be
its
members
for
the
ensuing
year
and
likewise
the
nine
archons
formerly
the
council
had
full
power
to
reject
candidates
for
office
as
unsuitable
but
now
they
have
an
appeal
to
the
in
all
these
matters
therefore
the
council
has
no
final
jurisdiction
it
takes
however
preliminary
cognizance
of
all
matters
brought
before
the
assembly
and
the
assembly
can
not
vote
on
any
question
unless
it
has
first
been
considered
by
the
council
and
placed
on
the
programme
by
the
prytanes
since
a
person
who
carries
a
motion
in
the
assembly
is
liable
to
an
action
for
illegal
proposal
on
these
grounds
part
the
council
also
superintends
the
triremes
that
are
already
in
existence
with
their
tackle
and
sheds
and
builds
new
triremes
or
quadriremes
whichever
the
assembly
votes
with
tackle
and
sheds
to
match
the
assembly
appoints
for
the
ships
by
vote
and
if
they
do
not
hand
them
over
completed
to
the
next
council
the
old
council
can
not
receive
the
customary
donation
that
being
normally
given
to
it
during
its
successor
term
of
office
for
the
building
of
the
triremes
it
appoints
ten
commissioners
chosen
from
its
own
members
the
council
also
inspects
all
public
buildings
and
if
it
is
of
opinion
that
the
state
is
being
defrauded
it
reports
the
culprit
to
the
assembly
and
on
condemnation
hands
him
over
to
the
part
the
council
also
with
other
magistrates
in
most
of
their
duties
first
there
are
the
treasurers
of
athena
ten
in
number
elected
by
lot
one
from
each
tribe
according
to
the
law
of
solon
which
is
still
in
force
they
must
be
pentacosiomedimni
but
in
point
of
fact
the
person
on
whom
the
lot
falls
holds
the
office
even
though
he
be
quite
a
poor
man
these
officers
take
over
charge
of
the
statue
of
athena
the
figures
of
victory
and
all
the
other
ornaments
of
the
temple
together
with
the
money
in
the
presence
of
the
council
then
there
are
the
commissioners
for
public
contracts
poletae
ten
in
number
one
chosen
by
lot
from
each
tribe
who
farm
out
the
public
contracts
they
lease
the
mines
and
taxes
in
conjunction
with
the
military
treasurer
and
the
commissioners
of
the
theoric
fund
in
the
presence
of
the
council
and
grant
to
the
persons
indicated
by
the
vote
of
the
council
the
mines
which
are
let
out
by
the
state
including
both
the
workable
ones
which
are
let
for
three
years
and
those
which
are
let
under
special
agreements
years
they
also
sell
in
the
presence
of
the
council
the
property
of
those
who
have
gone
into
exile
from
the
court
of
the
areopagus
and
of
others
whose
goods
have
been
confiscated
and
the
nine
archons
ratify
the
contracts
they
also
hand
over
to
the
council
lists
of
the
taxes
which
are
farmed
out
for
the
year
entering
on
whitened
tablets
the
name
of
the
lessee
and
the
amount
paid
they
make
separate
lists
first
of
those
who
have
to
pay
their
instalments
in
each
prytany
on
ten
several
tablets
next
of
those
who
pay
thrice
in
the
year
with
a
separate
tablet
for
each
instalment
and
finally
of
those
who
pay
in
the
ninth
prytany
they
also
draw
up
a
list
of
farms
and
dwellings
which
have
been
confiscated
and
sold
by
order
of
the
courts
for
these
too
come
within
their
province
in
the
case
of
dwellings
the
value
must
be
paid
up
in
five
years
and
in
that
of
farms
in
ten
the
instalments
are
paid
in
the
ninth
prytany
further
the
brings
before
the
council
the
leases
of
the
sacred
enclosures
written
on
whitened
tablets
these
too
are
leased
for
ten
years
and
the
instalments
are
paid
in
the
prytany
consequently
it
is
in
this
prytany
that
the
greatest
amount
of
money
is
collected
the
tablets
containing
the
lists
of
the
instalments
are
carried
into
the
council
and
the
public
clerk
takes
charge
of
them
whenever
a
payment
of
instalments
is
to
be
made
he
takes

may
be
struck
off
before
it
is
paid
part
there
are
ten
apodectae
elected
by
lot
one
from
each
tribe
these
officers
receive
the
tablets
and
strike
off
the
instalments
as
they
are
paid
in
the
presence
of
the
council
in
the
and
give
the
tablets
back
to
the
public
clerk
if
any
one
fails
to
pay
his
instalment
a
note
is
made
of
it
on
the
tablet
and
he
is
bound
to
pay
double
the
amount
of
the
deficiency
or
in
default
to
be
imprisoned
the
council
has
full
power
by
the
laws
to
exact
these
payments
and
to
inflict
this
imprisonment
they
receive
all
the
instalments
therefore
on
one
day
and
portion

to
the
apportionment
on
the
part
of
either
a

after
the
oligarchy
of

were
increased
to

they
have
full

to
decide

the

anything

the

are
persons
in
the
sixtieth
year
of
their
age
this
appears
from
the
schedule
of
the
archons
and
the
eponymi
there
are
two
classes
of
eponymi
the
ten
who
give
their
names
to
the
tribes
and
the
of
the
years
of
service
the
youths
on
being
enrolled
among
the
citizens
were
formerly
registered
upon
whitened
tablets
and
the
names
were
appended
of
the
archon
in
whose
year
they
were
enrolled
and
of
the
eponymus
who
had
been
in
course
in
the
preceding
year
at
the
present
day
they
are
written
on
a
bronze
pillar
which
stands
in
front
of
the
near
the
eponymi
of
the
tribes
then
the
forty
take
the
last
of
the
eponymi
of
the
years
of
service
and
assign
the
arbitrations
to
the
persons
belonging
to
that
year
casting
lots
to
determine
which
arbitrations
each
shall
undertake
and
every
one
is
compelled
to
carry
through
the
arbitrations
which
the
lot
assigns
to
him
the
law
enacts
that
any
one
who
does
not
serve
as
arbitrator
when
he
has
arrived
at
the
necessary
age
shall
lose
his
civil
rights
unless
he
happens
to
be
holding
some
other
office
during
that
year
or
to
be
out
of
the
country
these
are
the
only
persons
who
escape
the
duty
any
one
who
suffers
injustice
at
the
hands
of
the
arbitrator
may
appeal
to
the
whole
board
of
arbitrators
and
if
they
find
the
magistrate
guilty
the
law
enacts
that
he
shall
lose
his
civil
rights
the
persons
thus
condemned
have
however
in
their
turn
an
appeal
the
eponymi
are
also
used
in
reference
to
military
expeditions
when
the
men
of
military
age
are
despatched
on

is
put
up
stating
that
the

assessed
is
paid
without

otherwise
it
is

no
one
could
hold
the
office
if
the

but
now
there
is
an
appeal
to
the

is
the
final

in
the
matter
of
the
examination
when
they
are
examined
they
are

and
where
their
sanctuaries
are
next

vote
formerly
a
single
individual
gave
the
vote
but
now
all
the
members
are
obliged
to
vote
on
the
candidates
so
that
if
any
unprincipled
candidate
has
managed
to
get
rid
of
his
accusers
it
may
still
be
possible
for
him
to
be
disqualified

letter
as
that
on

he
is
chosen
by

lest
if
the
were
always
the

person
he

five
of

by

are
made
of
brass
coloured
black
or

many
white
dice

it
throws
the
ticket
of
the
juror
into
the
chest
on
which
is
inscribed
the
letter
which
is
on
the
counter
so
that
the
juror
must
go
into
the
court
assigned
to
him
by
lot
and
not
into
one
chosen
by
himself
and
that
it
may
be
impossible
for
any
one
to
collect
the
jurors
of
his
choice
into
any
particular
court
for
this
purpose
chests
are
placed
near
the
archon
as
many
in
number
as
there
are
courts
to
be
filled
that
day
bearing
the
letters
of
the
courts
on
which
the
lot
has
fallen

juror
thereupon
after
showing
his
counter
again
to
the
attendant
passes
through
the
barrier
into
the
court
the
attendant
gives
him
a
staff
of
the
same
colour
as
the
court
bearing
the
letter
which
is
on
his
counter
so
as
to
ensure
his
going
into
the
court
assigned
to
him
by
lot
since
if
he
were
to
go
into
any
other
he
would
be
betrayed
by
the
colour
of
his
staff
each
court
has
a
certain
colour
painted
on
the
lintel
of
the
entrance
accordingly
the
juror
bearing
his
staff
enters
the
court
which
has
the
same
colour
as
his
staff
and
the
same
letter
as
his
counter
as
he
enters
he
receives
a
voucher
from
the
official
to
whom
this
duty
has
been
assigned
by
lot
so
with
their
counters
and
their
staves
the
selected
jurors
take
their
seats
in
the
court

thus
completed
the
process
of
admission
the
unsuccessful
candidates
receive
back
their
tickets
from
the
the
public
servants

the
chests
from
each
tribe
one
to
each
court
containing
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
tribe
who
are
in
that
court
and
hand
them
over
to
the
officials
assigned
to
the
duty
of
giving
back
their
tickets
to
the
jurors
in
each
court
so
that
these
officials
may
call
them
up
by
name
and
pay
them
their
fee
part
when
all
the
courts
are
full
two
ballot
boxes
are
placed
in
the
first
court
and
a
number
of
brazen
dice
bearing
the
colours
of
the
several
courts
and
other
dice
inscribed
with
the
names
of
the
presiding
magistrates
then
two
of
the
thesmothetae
selected
by
lot
severally
throw
the
dice
with
the
colours
into
one
box
and
those
with
the
magistrates
names
into
the
other
the
magistrate
whose
name
is
first
drawn
is
thereupon
proclaimed
by
the
crier
as
assigned
for
duty
in
the
court
which
is
first
drawn
and
the
second
in
the
second
and
similarly
with
the
rest
the
object
of
this
procedure
is
that
no
one
may
know
which
court
he
will
have
but
that
each
may
take
the
court
assigned
to
him
by
lot
when
the
jurors
have
come
in
and
have
been
assigned
to
their
respective
courts
the
presiding
magistrate
in
each
court
draws
one
ticket
out
of
each
chest
making
ten
in
all
one
out
of
each
tribe
and
throws
them
into
another
empty
chest
he
then
draws
out
five
of
them
and
assigns
one
to
the
superintendence
of
the
and
the
other
four
to
the
telling
of
the
votes
this
is
to
prevent
any
tampering
beforehand
with
either
the
superintendent
of
the
clock
or
the
tellers
of
the
votes
and
to
secure
that
there
is
no
malpractice
in
these
respects
the
five
who
have
not
been
selected
for
these
duties
receive
from
them
a
statement
of
the
order
in
which
the
jurors
shall
receive
their
fees
and
of
the
places
where
the
several
tribes
shall
respectively
gather
in
the
court
for
this
purpose
when
their
duties
are
completed
the
object
being
that
the
jurors
may
be
broken
up
into
small
groups
for
the
reception
of
their
pay
and
not
all
crowd
together
and
impede
one
another

most
of
the
courts
consist
of
members
and
when
it
is
necessary
to
bring
public
cases
before
a
jury
of
members
two
courts
combine
for
the
purpose
the
most
important
cases
of
all
are
brought
jurors
or
three
courts
the
ballot
balls
are
made
of
brass
with
stems
running
through
the
centre
half
of
them
having
the
stem
pierced
and
the
other
half
solid
when
the
speeches
are
concluded
the
officials
assigned
to
the
taking
of
the
votes
give
each
juror
two
ballot
balls
one
pierced
and
one
solid
this
is
done
in
full
view
of
the
rival
litigants
to
secure
that
no
one
shall
receive
two
pierced
or
two
solid
balls
then
the
official
designated
for
the
purpose
takes
away
the
jurors
staves
in
return
for
which
each
one
as
he
records
his
vote
receives
a
brass
voucher
marked
with
the
numeral
because
he
gets
three
obols
when
he
gives
it
up
this
is
to
ensure
that
all
shall
vote
since
no
one
can
get
a
voucher
unless
he
votes
two
urns
one
of
brass
and
the
other
of
wood
stand
in
the
court
in
distinct
spots
so
that
no
one
may
surreptitiously
insert
ballot
balls
in
these
the
jurors
record
their
votes
the
brazen
urn
is
for
effective
votes
the
wooden
for
unused
votes
and
the
brazen
urn
has
a
lid
pierced
so
as
to
take
only
one
ballot
ball
in
order
that
no
one
may
put
in
two
at
a
time
when
the
jurors
are
about
to
vote
the
crier
demands
first
whether
the
litigants
enter
a
protest
against
any
of
the
evidence
for
no
protest
can
be
received
after
the
voting
has
begun
then
he
proclaims
again
pierced
ballot
for
the
plaintiff
the
solid
for
the
defendant
and
the
juror
taking
his
two
ballot
balls
from
the
stand
with
his
hand
closed
over
the
stem
so
as
not
to
show
either
the
pierced
or
the
solid
ballot
to
the
litigants
casts
the
one
which
is
to
count
into
the
brazen
urn
and
the
other
into
the
wooden
urn
part
when
all
the
jurors
have
voted
the
attendants
take
the
urn
containing
the
effective
votes
and
discharge
them
on
to
a
reckoning
board
having
as
many
cavities
as
there
are
ballot
balls
so
that
the
effective
votes
whether
pierced
or
solid
may
be
plainly
displayed
and
easily
counted
then
the
officials
assigned
to
the
taking
of
the
votes
tell
them
off
on
the
board
the
solid
in
one
place
and
the
pierced
in
another
and
the
crier
announces
the
numbers
of
the
votes
the
pierced
ballots
being
for
the
prosecutor
and
the
solid
for
the
defendant
whichever
has
the
majority
is
victorious
but
if
the
votes
are
equal
the
verdict
is
for
the
defendant
each
juror
receives
two
ballots
and
uses
one
to
record
his
vote
and
throws
the
other
away
then
if
damages
have
to
be
awarded
they
vote
again
in
the
same
way
first
returning
their
and
receiving
back
their
staves
half
a
gallon
of
water
is
allowed
to
each
party
for
the
discussion
of
the
damages
finally
when
all
has
been
completed
in
accordance
with
the
law
the
jurors
receive
their
pay
in
the
order
assigned
by
the
lot
the
end
