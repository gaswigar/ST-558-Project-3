note
as
you
may
be
aware
project
gutenberg
has
been
involved
with
the
writings
of
both
the
alexandre
dumases
for
some
time
now
and
since
we
get
a
few
questions
about
the
order
in
which
the
books
should
be
read
and
in
which
they
were
published
these
following
comments
should
hopefully
help
most
of
our
readers
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
is
the
final
volume
of
d
artagnan
romances
it
is
usually
split
into
three
or
four
parts
and
the
final
portion
is
entitled
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
we
re
familiar
with
today
is
the
last
volume
of
the
edition
not
all
the
editions
split
them
in
the
same
manner
hence
some
of
the
confusion
but
wait
there
s
yet
more
reason
for
confusion
we
intend
to
do
all
of
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
split
into
four
etexts
entitled
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
ten
years
later
louise
de
la
valliere
and
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
you
will
be
getting
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
one
thing
that
may
be
causing
confusion
is
that
the
etext
we
have
now
entitled
ten
years
later
says
it
s
the
sequel
to
the
three
musketeers
while
this
is
technically
true
there
s
another
book
twenty
years
after
that
comes
between
the
confusion
is
generated
by
the
two
facts
that
we
published
ten
years
later
before
we
published
twenty
years
after
and
that
many
people
see
those
titles
as
meaning
ten
and
twenty
years
after
the
original
story
however
this
is
why
the
different
words
after
and
later
the
ten
years
after
is
ten
years
after
the
twenty
years
later
as
per
history
also
the
third
book
of
the
d
artagnan
romances
while
entitled
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
has
the
subtitle
ten
years
later
these
two
titles
are
also
given
to
different
volumes
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
can
refer
to
the
whole
book
or
the
first
volume
of
the
three
or
editions
ten
years
later
can
similarly
refer
to
the
whole
book
or
the
second

of
the
edition
to
add

the
confusion

the

at

o

in

morning

the
sun
already
high
in

heavens
was
fast
absorbing
the
dew
from
the
ramparts
of
the
castle
of

composed
of

men
and
two
pages
the
city
by

bridge
without
producing
any
other
effect
upon
the
passengers
of
the
quay
beyond
a
first
movement
of
the
hand
to
the
head
as
a
salute
and
a
second
movement
of
the
tongue
to
express
in
the
purest
french
then
spoken
in
france
there
is
monsieur
returning
from
hunting
and
that
was
all
whilst
however
the
horses
were
climbing
the
steep
acclivity
which
leads
from
the
river
to
the
castle
several
approached
the
last
horse
from
whose
a
number
of
birds
were
suspended
by
the
beak
on
seeing
this
the
inquisitive
youths
manifested
with
rustic
freedom
their
contempt
for
such
paltry
sport
and
after
a
dissertation
among
themselves
upon
the
disadvantages
of
hawking
they
returned
to
their
occupations
one
only
of
the
curious
party
a
stout
stubby
cheerful
lad
having
demanded
how
it
was
that
monsieur
who
from
his
great
revenues
had
it
in
his
power
to
amuse
himself
so
much
better
could
be
satisfied
with
such
mean
diversions
do
you
not
know
one
of
the
replied
that
monsieur
s
principal
amusement
is
to
weary
himself
the
boy
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
which
said
as
clear
as
day
in
that
case
i
would
rather
be
plain
jack
than
a
prince
and
all
resumed
their
labors
in
the
meanwhile
monsieur
continued
his
route
with
an
air
at
once
so
melancholy
and
so
majestic
that
he
certainly
would
have
attracted
the
attention
of
spectators
if
spectators
there
had
been
but
the
good
citizens
of
blois
could
not
pardon
monsieur
for
having
chosen
their
gay
city
for
an
abode
in
which
to
indulge
melancholy
at
his
ease
and
as
often
as
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
illustrious
ennuye
they
stole
away
gaping
or
drew
back
their
heads
into
the
interior
of
their
dwellings
to
escape
the
soporific
influence
of
that
long
pale
face
of
those
watery
eyes
and
that
languid
address
so
that
the
worthy
prince
was
almost
certain
to
find
the
streets
deserted
whenever
he
chanced
to
pass
through
them
now
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
of
blois
this
was
a
culpable
piece
of
disrespect
for
monsieur
was
after
the
king
nay
even
perhaps
before
the
king
the
greatest
noble
of
the
kingdom
in
fact
god
who
had
granted
to
louis
then
reigning
the
honor
of
being
son
of
louis
had
granted
to
monsieur
the
honor
of
being
son
of
henry
iv
it
was
not
then
or
at
least
it
ought
not
to
have
been
a
trifling
source
of
pride
for
the
city
of
blois
that
gaston
of
orleans
had
chosen
it
as
his
residence
and
held
his
court
in
the
ancient
castle
of
the
states
but
it
was
the
destiny
of
this
great
prince
to
excite
the
attention
and
admiration
of
the
public
in
a
very
modified
degree
wherever
he
might
be
monsieur
had
fallen
into
this
situation
by
habit
it
was
not
perhaps
this
which
gave
him
that
air
of
listlessness
monsieur
had
already
been
tolerably
busy
in
the
course
of
his
life
a
man
can
not
allow
the
heads
of
a
dozen
of
his
best
friends
to
be
cut
off
without
feeling
a
little
excitement
and
as
since
the
accession
of
mazarin
to
power
no
heads
had
been
cut
off
monsieur
s
occupation
was
gone
and
his
morale
suffered
from
it
the
life
of
the
poor
prince
was
then
very
dull
after
his
little
morning
on
the
banks
of
the
beuvron
or
in
the
woods
of
cheverny
monsieur
crossed
the
loire
went
to
breakfast
at
chambord
with
or
without
an
appetite
and
the
city
of
blois
heard
no
more
of
its
sovereign
lord
and
master
till
the
next
so
much
for
the
ennui
extra
muros
of
the
ennui
of
the
interior
we
will
give
the
reader
an
idea
if
he
will
with
us
follow
the
cavalcade
to
the
majestic
porch
of
the
castle
of
the
states
monsieur
rode
a
little
horse
equipped
with
a
large
saddle
of
red
flemish
velvet
with
stirrups
in
the
shape
of
buskins
the
horse
was
of
a
bay
color
monsieur
s
pourpoint
of
crimson
velvet
corresponded
with
the
cloak
of
the
same
shade
and
the
horse
s
equipment
and
it
was
only
by
this
red
appearance
of
the
whole
that
the
prince
could
be
known
from
his
two
companions
the
one
dressed
in
violet
the
other
in
green
he
on
the
left
in
violet
was
his
equerry
he
on
the
right
in
green
was
the
grand
veneur
one
of
the
pages
carried
two
gerfalcons
upon
a
perch
the
other
a
which
he
blew
with
a
careless
note
at
twenty
paces
from
the
castle
every
one
about
this
listless
prince
did
what
he
had
to
listlessly
at
this
signal
eight
guards
who
were
lounging
in
the
sun
in
the
square
court
ran
to
their
halberts
and
monsieur
made
his
solemn
entry
into
the
castle
when
he
had
disappeared
under
the
shades
of
the
porch
three
or
four
idlers
who
had
followed
the
cavalcade
to
the
castle
after
pointing
out
the
suspended
birds
to
each
other
dispersed
with
comments
upon
what
they
saw
and
when
they
were
gone
the
street
the
palace
and
the
court
all
remained
deserted
alike
monsieur
dismounted
without
speaking
a
word
went
straight
to
his
apartments
where
his
valet
changed
his
dress
and
as
madame
had
not
yet
sent
orders
respecting
breakfast
monsieur
stretched
himself
upon
a
chaise
longue
and
was
soon
as
fast
asleep
as
if
it
had
been
eleven
o
clock
at
night
the
eight
guards
who
concluded
their
service
for
the
day
was
over
laid
themselves
down
very
comfortably
in
the
sun
upon
some
stone
benches
the
grooms
disappeared
with
their
horses
into
the
stables
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
joyous
birds
startling
each
other
with
their
sharp
chirping
in
the
tufted
shrubberies
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
whole
castle
was
as
soundly
asleep
as
monsieur
was
all
at
once
in
the
midst
of
this
delicious
silence
there
resounded
a
clear
ringing
laugh
which
caused
several
of
the
halberdiers
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
siesta
to
open
at
least
one
eye
this
burst
of
laughter
proceeded
from
a
window
of
the
castle
visited
at
this
moment
by
the
sun
that
embraced
it
in
one
of
those
large
angles
which
the
profiles
of
the
chimneys
mark
out
upon
the
walls
before
the
little
balcony
of
wrought
iron
which
advanced
in
front
of
this
window
was
furnished
with
a
pot
of
red
gilliflowers
another
pot
of
primroses
and
an
early
the
foliage
of
which
beautifully
green
was
variegated
with
numerous
red
specks
announcing
future
roses
in
the
chamber
lighted
by
this
window
was
a
square
table
covered
with
an
old
haarlem
tapestry
in
the
center
of
this
table
was
a
stone
bottle
in
which
were
irises
and
lilies
of
the
valley
at
each
end
of
this
table
was
a
young
girl
the
position
of
these
two
young
people
was
singular
they
might
have
been
taken
for
two
boarders
escaped
from
a
convent
one
of
them
with
both
elbows
on
the
table
and
a
pen
in
her
hand
was
tracing
characters
upon
a
sheet
of
fine
dutch
paper
the
other
kneeling
upon
a
chair
which
allowed
her
to
advance
her
head
and
bust
over
the
back
of
it
to
the
middle
of
the
table
was
watching
her
companion
as
she
wrote
or
rather
hesitated
to
write
thence
the
thousand
cries
the
thousand
railleries
the
thousand
laughs
one
of
which
more
brilliant
than
the
rest
had
startled
the
birds
in
the
gardens
and
disturbed
the
slumbers
of
monsieur
s
guards
we
are
taking
portraits
now
we
shall
be
allowed
therefore
we
hope
to
sketch
the
two
last
of
this
chapter
the
one
who
was
leaning
in
the
chair
that
is
to
say
the
joyous
laughing
one
was
a
beautiful
girl
of
from
eighteen
to
twenty
with
brown
complexion
and
brown
hair
splendid
from
eyes
which
sparkled
beneath
brows
and
particularly
from
her
teeth
which
seemed
to
shine
like
pearls
between
her
red
coral
lips
her
every
movement
seemed
the
accent
of
a
sunny
nature
she
did
not
walk
she
bounded
the
other
she
who
was
writing
looked
at
her
turbulent
companion
with
an
eye
as
limpid
as
pure
and
as
blue
as
the
azure
of
the
day
her
hair
of
a
shaded
fairness
arranged
with
exquisite
taste
fell
in
silky
curls
over
her
lovely
mantling
cheeks
she
passed
across
the
paper
a
delicate
hand
whose
thinness
announced
her
extreme
youth
at
each
burst
of
laughter
that
proceeded
from
her
friend
she
raised
as
if
annoyed
her
white
shoulders
in
a
poetical
and
mild
manner
but
they
were
wanting
in
that
richfulness
of
mold
that
was
likewise
to
be
wished
in
her
arms
and
hands
montalais
montalais
said
she
at
length
in
a
voice
soft
and
caressing
as
a
melody
you
laugh
too
loud
you
laugh
like
a
man
you
will
not
only
draw
the
attention
of
messieurs
the
guards
but
you
will
not
hear
madame
s
bell
when
madame
rings
this
admonition
neither
made
the
young
girl
called
montalais
cease
to
laugh
nor
gesticulate
she
only
replied
louise
you
do
not
speak
as
you
think
my
dear
you
know
that
messieurs
the
guards
as
you
call
them
have
only
just
commenced
their
sleep
and
that
a
cannon
would
not
waken
them
you
know
that
madame
s
bell
can
be
heard
at
the
bridge
of
blois
and
that
consequently
i
shall
hear
it
when
my
services
are
required
by
madame
what
annoys
you
my
child
is
that
i
laugh
while
you
are
writing
and
what
you
are
afraid
of
is
that
madame
de
your
mother
should
come
up
here
as
she
does
sometimes
when
we
laugh
too
loud
that
she
should
surprise
us
and
that
she
should
see
that
enormous
sheet
of
paper
upon
which
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
have
only
traced
the
words
monsieur
raoul
now
you
are
right
my
dear
louise
because
after
these
words
monsieur
raoul
others
may
be
put
so
significant
and
incendiary
as
to
cause
madame
to
burst
out
into
fire
and
flames
hein
is
not
that
true
now
say
and
montalais
redoubled
her
laughter
and
noisy
provocations
the
fair
girl
at
length
became
quite
angry
she
tore
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
in
fact
the
words
monsieur
raoul
were
written
in
good
characters
and
crushing
the
paper
in
her
trembling
hands
she
threw
it
out
of
the
window
there
there
said
mademoiselle
de
montalais
there
is
our
little
lamb
our
gentle
dove
angry
don
t
be
afraid
louise
madame
de
will
not
come
and
if
she
should
you
know
i
have
a
quick
ear
besides
what
can
be
more
permissible
than
to
write
to
an
old
friend
of
twelve
years
standing
particularly
when
the
letter
begins
with
the
words
monsieur
raoul
it
is
all
very
well
i
will
not
write
to
him
at
all
said
the
young
girl
ah
ah
in
good
sooth
montalais
is
properly
punished
cried
the
jeering
brunette
still
laughing
come
come
let
us
try
another
sheet
of
paper
and
finish
our
dispatch
good
there
is
the
bell
ringing
now
by
my
faith
so
much
the
worse
madame
must
wait
or
else
do
without
her
first
maid
of
honor
this
morning
a
bell
in
fact
did
ring
it
announced
that
madame
had
finished
her
toilette
and
waited
for
monsieur
to
give
her
his
hand
and
conduct
her
from
the
salon
to
the
refectory
this
formality
being
accomplished
with
great
ceremony
the
husband
and
wife
breakfasted
and
then
separated
till
the
hour
of
dinner
invariably
fixed
at
two
o
clock
the
sound
of
this
bell
caused
a
door
to
be
opened
in
the
offices
on
the
left
hand
of
the
court
from
which
filed
two
maitres
d
hotel
followed
by
eight
scullions
bearing
a
kind
of
loaded
with
dishes
under
silver
covers
one
of
the
maitres
d
hotel
the
first
in
rank
touched
one
of
the
guards
who
was
snoring
on
his
bench
slightly
with
his
wand
he
even
carried
his
kindness
so
far
as
to
place
the
halbert
which
stood
against
the
wall
in
the
hands
of
the
man
stupid
with
sleep
after
which
the
soldier
without
explanation
escorted
the
viande
of
monsieur
to
the
refectory
preceded
by
a
page
and
the
two
maitres
d
hotel
wherever
the
viande
passed
the
soldiers
ported
arms
mademoiselle
de
montalais
and
her
companion
had
watched
from
their
window
the
details
of
this
ceremony
to
which
by
the
bye
they
must
have
been
pretty
well
accustomed
but
they
did
not
look
so
much
from
curiosity
as
to
be
assured
they
should
not
be
disturbed
so
guards
scullions
maitres
d
hotel
and
pages
having
passed
they
resumed
their
places
at
the
table
and
the
sun
which
through
the
had
for
an
instant
fallen
upon
those
two
charming
countenances
now
only
shed
its
light
upon
the
gilliflowers
primroses
and
bah
said
mademoiselle
de
montalais
taking
her
place
again
madame
will
breakfast
very
well
without
me
oh
montalais
you
will
be
punished
replied
the
other
girl
sitting
down
quietly
in
hers
punished
indeed
that
is
to
say
deprived
of
a
ride
that
is
just
the
way
in
which
i
wish
to
be
punished
to
go
out
in
the
grand
coach
perched
upon
a
doorstep
to
turn
to
the
left
twist
round
to
the
right
over
roads
full
of
ruts
where
we
can
not
exceed
a
league
in
two
hours
and
then
to
come
back
straight
towards
the
wing
of
the
castle
in
which
is
the
window
of
mary
de
medici
so
that
madame
never
fails
to
say
could
one
believe
it
possible
that
mary
de
medici
should
have
escaped
from
that
window
feet
high
the
mother
of
two
princes
and
three
princesses
if
you
call
that
relaxation
louise
all
i
ask
is
to
be
punished
every
day
particularly
when
my
punishment
is
to
remain
with
you
and
write
such
interesting
letters
as
we
write
montalais
montalais
there
are
duties
to
be
performed
you
talk
of
them
very
much
at
your
ease
dear
child
you
who
are
left
quite
free
amidst
this
tedious
court
you
are
the
only
person
that
reaps
the
advantages
of
them
without
incurring
the
trouble
you
who
are
really
more
one
of
madame
s
maids
of
honor
than
i
am
because
madame
makes
her
affection
for
your
glance
off
upon
you
so
that
you
enter
this
dull
house
as
the
birds
fly
into
yonder
court
inhaling
the
air
pecking
the
flowers
picking
up
the
grain
without
having
the
least
service
to
perform
or
the
least
annoyance
to
undergo
and
you
talk
to
me
of
duties
to
be
performed
in
sooth
my
pretty
idler
what
are
your
own
proper
duties
unless
to
write
to
the
handsome
raoul
and
even
that
you
don
t
do
so
that
it
looks
to
me
as
if
you
likewise
were
rather
negligent
of
your
duties
louise
assumed
a
serious
air
leant
her
chin
upon
her
hand
and
in
a
tone
full
of
candid
remonstrance
and
do
you
reproach
me
with
my
good
fortune
said
she
can
you
have
the
heart
to
do
it
you
have
a
future
you
will
belong
to
the
court
the
king
if
he
should
marry
will
require
monsieur
to
be
near
his
person
you
will
see
splendid
fetes
you
will
see
the
king
who
they
say
is
so
handsome
so
agreeable
ay
and
still
more
i
shall
see
raoul
who
attends
upon
le
prince
added
montalais
maliciously
poor
raoul
sighed
louise
now
is
the
time
to
write
to
him
my
pretty
dear
come
begin
again
with
that
famous
monsieur
raoul
which
figures
at
the
top
of
the
poor
torn
sheet
she
then
held
the
pen
toward
her
and
with
a
charming
smile
encouraged
her
hand
which
quickly
traced
the
words
she
named
what
next
asked
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
why
now
write
what
you
think
louise
replied
montalais
are
you
quite
sure
i
think
of
anything
you
think
of
somebody
and
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing
or
rather
even
more
do
you
think
so
montalais
louise
louise
your
blue
eyes
are
as
deep
as
the
sea
i
saw
at
boulogne
last
year
no
no
i
mistake
the
sea
is
perfidious
your
eyes
are
as
deep
as
the
azure
yonder
look
over
our
heads
well
since
you
can
read
so
well
in
my
eyes
tell
me
what
i
am
thinking
about
montalais
in
the
first
place
you
don
t
think
monsieur
raoul
you
think
my
dear
raoul
oh
never
blush
for
such
a
trifle
as
that
my
dear
raoul
we
will
say
you
implore
me
to
write
you
at
paris
where
you
are
detained
by
your
attendance
on
le
prince
as
you
must
be
very
dull
there
to
seek
for
amusement
in
the
remembrance
of
a
provinciale
louise
rose
up
suddenly
no
montalais
said
she
with
a
smile
i
don
t
think
a
word
of
that
look
this
is
what
i
think
and
she
seized
the
pen
boldly
and
traced
with
a
firm
hand
the
following
words
i
should
have
been
very
unhappy
if
your
entreaties
to
obtain
a
remembrance
of
me
had
been
less
warm
everything
here
reminds
me
of
our
early
days
which
so
quickly
passed
away
which
so
delightfully
flew
by
that
no
others
will
ever
replace
the
charm
of
them
in
my
heart
montalais
who
watched
the
flying
pen
and
read
the
wrong
way
upwards
as
fast
as
her
friend
wrote
here
interrupted
by
clapping
her
hands
capital
cried
she
there
is
frankness
there
is
heart
there
is
style
show
these
parisians
my
dear
that
blois
is
the
city
for
fine
language
he
knows
very
well
that
blois
was
a
paradise
to
me
replied
the
girl
that
is
exactly
what
you
mean
to
say
and
you
speak
like
an
angel
i
will
finish
montalais
and
she
continued
as
follows
you
often
think
of
me
you
say
monsieur
raoul
i
thank
you
but
that
does
not
surprise
me
when
i
recollect
how
often
our
hearts
have
beaten
close
to
each
other
oh
oh
said
montalais
beware
my
lamb
you
are
scattering
your
wool
and
there
are
wolves
about
louise
was
about
to
reply
when
the
gallop
of
a
horse
resounded
under
the
porch
of
the
castle
what
is
that
said
montalais
approaching
the
window
a
handsome
cavalier
by
my
faith
oh
raoul
exclaimed
louise
who
had
made
the
same
movement
as
her
friend
and
becoming
pale
as
death
sunk
back
beside
her
unfinished
letter
now
he
is
a
clever
lover
upon
my
word
cried
montalais
he
arrives
just
at
the
proper
moment
come
in
come
in
i
implore
you
murmured
louise
bah
he
does
not
know
me
let
me
see
what
he
has
come
here
for
chapter
ii
the
messenger
mademoiselle
de
montalais
was
right
the
young
cavalier
was
goodly
to
look
upon
he
was
a
young
man
of
from
to
years
of
age
tall
and
slender
wearing
gracefully
the
picturesque
military
costume
of
the
period
his
large
boots
contained
a
foot
which
mademoiselle
de
montalais
might
not
have
disowned
if
she
had
been
transformed
into
a
man
with
one
of
his
delicate
but
nervous
hands
he
checked
his
horse
in
the
middle
of
the
court
and
with
the
other
raised
his
hat
whose
long
plumes
shaded
his
at
once
serious
and
ingenuous
countenance
the
guards
roused
by
the
steps
of
the
horse
awoke
and
were
on
foot
in
a
minute
the
young
man
waited
till
one
of
them
was
close
to
his
then
stooping
towards
him
in
a
clear
distinct
voice
which
was
perfectly
audible
at
the
window
where
the
two
girls
were
concealed
a
message
for
his
royal
highness
he
said
ah
ah
cried
the
soldier
officer
a
messenger
but
this
brave
guard
knew
very
well
that
no
officer
would
appear
seeing
that
the
only
one
who
could
have
appeared
dwelt
at
the
other
side
of
the
castle
in
an
apartment
looking
into
the
gardens
so
he
hastened
to
add
the
officer
monsieur
is
on
his
rounds
but
in
his
absence
de
the
maitre
d
hotel
shall
be
informed
de
repeated
the
cavalier
slightly
blushing
do
you
know
him
why
yes
but
request
him
if
you
please
that
my
visit
be
announced
to
his
royal
highness
as
soon
as
possible
it
appears
to
be
pressing
said
the
guard
as
if
speaking
to
himself
but
really
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
an
answer
the
messenger
made
an
affirmative
sign
with
his
head
in
that
case
said
the
guard
i
will
go
and
seek
the
maitre
d
hotel
myself
the
young
man
in
the
meantime
dismounted
and
whilst
the
others
were
making
their
remarks
upon
the
fine
horse
the
cavalier
rode
the
soldier
returned
your
pardon
young
gentleman
but
your
name
if
you
please
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
on
the
part
of
his
highness
le
prince
de
conde
the
soldier
made
a
profound
bow
and
as
if
the
name
of
the
conqueror
of
rocroi
and
lens
had
given
him
wings
he
stepped
lightly
up
the
steps
leading
to
the
de
bragelonne
had
not
had
time
to
fasten
his
horse
to
the
iron
bars
of
the
perron
when
de
came
running
out
of
breath
supporting
his
capacious
body
with
one
hand
whilst
with
the
other
he
cut
the
air
as
a
fisherman
cleaves
the
waves
with
his
oar
ah
monsieur
le
vicomte
you
at
blois
cried
he
well
that
is
a
wonder
to
you
monsieur
raoul
i
offer
you
a
thousand
respects
de
how
madame
de
la
vall
i
mean
how
delighted
madame
de
will
be
to
see
you
but
come
in
his
royal
highness
is
at
breakfast
must
he
be
interrupted
is
the
matter
serious
yes
and
no
monsieur
de
a
moment
s
delay
however
would
be
disagreeable
to
his
royal
highness
if
that
is
the
case
we
will
force
the
consigne
monsieur
le
vicomte
come
in
besides
monsieur
is
in
an
excellent
humor
and
then
you
bring
news
do
you
not
great
news
monsieur
de
and
good
i
presume
excellent
come
quickly
come
quickly
then
cried
the
worthy
man
putting
his
dress
to
rights
as
he
went
along
raoul
followed
him
hat
in
hand
and
a
little
disconcerted
at
the
noise
made
by
his
spurs
in
these
immense
salons
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
in
the
interior
of
the
palace
the
window
of
the
court
was
repeopled
and
an
animated
whispering
betrayed
the
emotion
of
the
two
girls
they
soon
appeared
to
have
formed
a
resolution
for
one
of
the
two
faces
disappeared
from
the
window
this
was
the
brunette
the
other
remained
behind
the
balcony
concealed
by
the
flowers
watching
attentively
through
the
branches
the
perron
by
which
de
bragelonne
had
entered
the
castle
in
the
meantime
the
object
of
so
much
laudable
curiosity
continued
his
route
following
the
steps
of
the
maitre
d
hotel
the
noise
of
quick
steps
an
odor
of
wine
and
viands
a
clinking
of
crystal
and
plates
warned
them
that
they
were
coming
to
the
end
of
their
course
the
pages
valets
and
officers
assembled
in
the
office
which
led
up
to
the
refectory
welcomed
the
newcomer
with
the
proverbial
politeness
of
the
country
some
of
them
were
acquainted
with
raoul
and
all
knew
that
he
came
from
paris
it
might
be
said
that
his
arrival
for
a
moment
suspended
the
service
in
fact
a
page
who
was
pouring
out
wine
for
his
royal
highness
on
hearing
the
jingling
of
spurs
in
the
next
chamber
turned
round
like
a
child
without
perceiving
that
he
was
continuing
to
pour
out
not
into
the
glass
but
upon
the
tablecloth
madame
who
was
not
so
preoccupied
as
her
glorious
spouse
was
remarked
this
distraction
of
the
page
well
exclaimed
she
well
repeated
monsieur
what
is
going
on
then
de
who
had
just
introduced
his
head
through
the
doorway
took
advantage
of
the
moment
why
am
i
to
be
disturbed
said
gaston
helping
himself
to
a
thick
slice
of
one
of
the
largest
salmon
that
had
ever
ascended
the
loire
to
be
captured
between
paimboeuf
and
there
is
a
messenger
from
paris
oh
but
after
monseigneur
has
breakfasted
will
do
there
is
plenty
of
time
from
paris
cried
the
prince
letting
his
fork
fall
a
messenger
from
paris
do
you
say
and
on
whose
part
does
this
messenger
come
on
the
part
of
le
prince
said
the
maitre
d
hotel
promptly
every
one
knows
that
the
prince
de
conde
was
so
called
a
messenger
from
le
prince
said
gaston
with
an
inquietude
that
escaped
none
of
the
assistants
and
consequently
redoubled
the
general
curiosity
monsieur
perhaps
fancied
himself
brought
back
again
to
the
happy
times
when
the
opening
of
a
door
gave
him
an
emotion
in
which
every
letter
might
contain
a
state
secret
in
which
every
message
was
connected
with
a
dark
and
complicated
intrigue
perhaps
likewise
that
great
name
of
le
prince
expanded
itself
beneath
the
roofs
of
blois
to
the
proportions
of
a
phantom
monsieur
pushed
away
his
plate
shall
i
tell
the
envoy
to
wait
asked
de
a
glance
from
madame
emboldened
gaston
who
replied
no
no
let
him
come
in
at
once
on
the
contrary
a
propos
who
is
he
a
gentleman
of
this
country
le
vicomte
de
bragelonne
ah
very
well
introduce
him
introduce
him
and
when
he
had
let
fall
these
words
with
his
accustomed
gravity
monsieur
turned
his
eyes
in
a
certain
manner
upon
the
people
of
his
suite
so
that
all
pages
officers
and
equerries
quitted
the
service
knives
and
goblets
and
made
towards
the
second
chamber
door
a
retreat
as
rapid
as
it
was
disorderly
this
little
army
had
dispersed
in
two
files
when
raoul
de
bragelonne
preceded
by
de
entered
the
refectory
the
short
interval
of
solitude
which
this
retreat
had
left
him
permitted
monsieur
the
time
to
assume
a
diplomatic
countenance
he
did
not
turn
round
but
waited
till
the
maitre
d
hotel
should
bring
the
messenger
face
to
face
with
him
raoul
stopped
even
with
the
lower
end
of
the
table
so
as
to
be
exactly
between
monsieur
and
madame
from
this
place
he
made
a
profound
bow
to
monsieur
and
a
very
humble
one
to
madame
then
drawing
himself
up
into
military
pose
he
waited
for
monsieur
to
address
him
on
his
part
the
prince
waited
till
the
doors
were
hermetically
closed
he
would
not
turn
round
to
ascertain
the
fact
as
that
would
have
been
derogatory
to
his
dignity
but
he
listened
with
all
his
ears
for
the
noise
of
the
lock
which
would
promise
him
at
least
an
appearance
of
secrecy
the
doors
being
closed
monsieur
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
vicomte
and
said
it
appears
that
you
come
from
paris
monsieur
this
minute
monseigneur
how
is
the
king
his
majesty
is
in
perfect
health
monseigneur
and
my
her
majesty
the
still
suffers
from
the
complaint
in
her
chest
but
for
the
last
month
she
has
been
rather
better
somebody
told
me
you
came
on
the
part
of
le
prince
they
must
have
been
mistaken
surely
no
monseigneur
le
prince
has
charged
me
to
convey
this
letter
to
your
royal
highness
and
i
am
to
wait
for
an
answer
to
it
raoul
had
been
a
little
annoyed
by
this
cold
and
cautious
reception
and
his
voice
insensibly
sank
to
a
low
key
the
prince
forgot
that
he
was
the
cause
of
this
apparent
mystery
and
his
fears
returned
he
received
the
letter
from
the
prince
de
conde
with
a
haggard
look
unsealed
it
as
he
would
have
unsealed
a
suspicious
packet
and
in
order
to
read
it
so
that
no
one
should
remark
the
effects
of
it
upon
his
countenance
he
turned
round
madame
followed
with
an
anxiety
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
prince
every
maneuver
of
her
august
husband
raoul
impassible
and
a
little
disengaged
by
the
attention
of
his
hosts
looked
from
his
place
through
the
open
window
at
the
gardens
and
the
statues
which
peopled
them
well
cried
monsieur
all
at
once
with
a
cheerful
smile
here
is
an
agreeable
surprise
and
a
charming
letter
from
le
prince
look
madame
the
table
was
too
large
to
allow
the
arm
of
the
prince
to
reach
the
hand
of
madame
raoul
sprang
forward
to
be
their
intermediary
and
did
it
with
so
good
a
grace
as
to
procure
a
flattering
acknowledgement
from
the
princess
you
know
the
contents
of
this
letter
no
doubt
said
gaston
to
raoul
yes
monseigneur
le
prince
at
first
gave
me
the
message
verbally
but
upon
reflection
his
highness
took
up
his
pen
it
is
beautiful
writing
said
madame
but
i
can
not
read
it
will
you
read
it
to
madame
de
bragelonne
said
the
duke
yes
read
it
if
you
please
monsieur
raoul
began
to
read
monsieur
giving
again
all
his
attention
the
letter
was
conceived
in
these
terms
monseigneur
the
king
is
about
to
set
out
for
the
frontiers
you
are
aware
the
marriage
of
his
majesty
is
concluded
upon
the
king
has
done
me
the
honor
to
appoint
me
his
for
this
journey
and
as
i
knew
with
what
joy
his
majesty
would
pass
a
day
at
blois
i
venture
to
ask
your
royal
highness
s
permission
to
mark
the
house
you
inhabit
as
our
quarters
if
however
the
suddenness
of
this
request
should
create
to
your
royal
highness
any
embarrassment
i
entreat
you
to
say
so
by
the
messenger
i
send
a
gentleman
of
my
suite
le
vicomte
de
bragelonne
my
itinerary
will
depend
on
your
royal
highness
s
determination
and
instead
of
passing
through
blois
we
shall
come
through
vendome
or
romorantin
i
venture
to
hope
that
your
royal
highness
will
be
pleased
with
my
arrangement
it
being
the
expression
of
my
boundless
desire
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
you
nothing
can
be
more
gracious
toward
us
said
madame
who
had
more
than
once
consulted
the
looks
of
her
husband
during
the
reading
of
the
letter
the
king
here
exclaimed
she
in
a
rather
louder
tone
than
would
have
been
necessary
to
preserve
secrecy
monsieur
said
his
royal
highness
in
his
turn
you
will
offer
my
thanks
to
de
conde
and
express
to
him
my
gratitude
for
the
honor
he
has
done
me
raoul
bowed
on
what
day
will
his
majesty
arrive
continued
the
prince
the
king
monseigneur
will
in
all
probability
arrive
this
evening
but
how
then
could
he
have
known
my
reply
if
it
had
been
in
the
negative
i
was
desired
monseigneur
to
return
in
all
haste
to
beaugency
to
give
to
the
courier
who
was
himself
to
go
back
immediately
with
to
le
prince
his
majesty
is
at
orleans
then
much
nearer
monseigneur
his
majesty
must
by
this
time
have
arrived
at
meung
does
the
court
accompany
him
yes
monseigneur
a
propos
i
forgot
to
ask
you
after
le
cardinal
his
eminence
appears
to
enjoy
good
health
monseigneur
his
nieces
accompany
him
no
doubt
no
monseigneur
his
eminence
has
ordered
the
mesdemoiselles
de
mancini
to
set
out
for
brouage
they
will
follow
the
left
bank
of
the
loire
while
the
court
will
come
by
the
right
what
mademoiselle
mary
de
mancini
quit
the
court
in
that
manner
asked
monsieur
his
reserve
beginning
to
diminish
mademoiselle
mary
de
mancini
in
particular
replied
raoul
discreetly
a
fugitive
smile
an
imperceptible
vestige
of
his
ancient
spirit
of
intrigue
shot
across
the
pale
face
of
the
prince
thanks
de
bragelonne
then
said
monsieur
you
would
perhaps
not
be
willing
to
carry
le
prince
the
commission
with
which
i
would
charge
you
and
that
is
that
his
messenger
has
been
very
agreeable
to
me
but
i
will
tell
him
so
myself
raoul
bowed
his
thanks
to
monsieur
for
the
honor
he
had
done
him
monsieur
made
a
sign
to
madame
who
struck
a
bell
which
was
placed
at
her
right
hand
de
entered
and
the
room
was
soon
filled
with
people
messieurs
said
the
prince
his
majesty
is
about
to
pay
me
the
honor
of
passing
a
day
at
blois
i
depend
on
the
king
my
nephew
not
having
to
repent
of
the
favor
he
does
my
house
vive
le
roi
cried
all
the
officers
of
the
household
with
frantic
enthusiasm
and
de
louder
than
the
rest
gaston
hung
down
his
head
with
evident
chagrin
he
had
all
his
life
been
obliged
to
hear
or
rather
to
undergo
this
cry
of
vive
le
roi
which
passed
over
him
for
a
long
time
being
unaccustomed
to
hear
it
his
ear
had
had
rest
and
now
a
younger
more
vivacious
and
more
brilliant
royalty
rose
up
before
him
like
a
new
and
more
painful
provocation
madame
perfectly
understood
the
sufferings
of
that
timid
gloomy
heart
she
rose
from
the
table
monsieur
imitated
her
mechanically
and
all
the
domestics
with
a
buzzing
like
that
of
several
surrounded
raoul
for
the
purpose
of
questioning
him
madame
saw
this
movement
and
called
de
this
is
not
the
time
for
gossiping
but
working
said
she
with
the
tone
of
an
angry
housekeeper
de
hastened
to
break
the
circle
formed
by
the
officers
round
raoul
so
that
the
latter
was
able
to
gain
the
care
will
be
taken
of
that
gentleman
i
hope
added
madame
addressing
de
the
worthy
man
immediately
hastened
after
raoul
madame
desires
refreshments
to
be
offered
to
you
said
he
and
there
is
besides
a
lodging
for
you
in
the
castle
thanks
de
replied
raoul
but
you
know
how
anxious
i
must
be
to
pay
my
duty
to
le
comte
my
father
that
is
true
that
is
true
monsieur
raoul
present
him
at
the
same
time
my
humble
respects
if
you
please
raoul
thus
once
more
got
rid
of
the
old
gentleman
and
pursued
his
way
as
he
was
passing
under
the
porch
leading
his
horse
by
the
bridle
a
soft
voice
called
him
from
the
depths
of
an
obscure
path
monsieur
raoul
said
the
voice
the
young
man
turned
round
surprised
and
saw
a
dark
complexioned
girl
who
with
a
finger
on
her
lip
held
out
her
other
hand
to
him
this
young
lady
was
an
utter
stranger
chapter
iii
the
interview
raoul
made
one
step
towards
the
girl
who
thus
called
him
but
my
horse
madame
said
he
oh
you
are
terribly
embarrassed
go
yonder
way
there
is
a
shed
in
the
outer
court
fasten
your
horse
and
return
quickly
i
obey
madame
raoul
was
not
four
minutes
in
performing
what
he
had
been
directed
to
do
he
returned
to
the
little
door
where
in
the
gloom
he
found
his
mysterious
conductress
waiting
for
him
on
the
first
steps
of
a
winding
staircase
are
you
brave
enough
to
follow
me
monsieur
knight
errant
asked
the
girl
laughing
at
the
momentary
hesitation
raoul
had
manifested
the
latter
replied
by
springing
up
the
dark
staircase
after
her
they
thus
climbed
up
three
stories
he
behind
her
touching
with
his
hands
when
he
felt
for
the
banister
a
silk
dress
which
rubbed
against
each
side
of
the
staircase
at
every
false
step
made
by
raoul
his
conductress
cried
hush
and
held
out
to
him
a
soft
perfumed
hand
one
would
mount
thus
to
the
belfry
of
the
castle
without
being
conscious
of
fatigue
said
raoul
all
of
which
means
monsieur
that
you
are
very
much
perplexed
very
tired
and
very
uneasy
but
be
of
good
cheer
monsieur
here
we
are
at
our
destination
the
girl
threw
open
a
door
which
immediately
without
any
transition
filled
with
a
flood
of
light
the
landing
of
the
staircase
at
the
top
of
which
raoul
appeared
holding
fast
by
the
balustrade
the
girl
continued
to
walk
on
he
followed
her
she
entered
a
chamber
he
did
the
same
as
soon
as
he
was
fairly
in
the
net
he
heard
a
loud
cry
and
turning
round
saw
at
two
paces
from
him
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
eyes
closed
that
beautiful
fair
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
white
shoulders
who
recognizing
him
called
him
raoul
he
saw
her
and
divined
at
once
so
much
love
and
so
much
joy
in
the
expression
of
her
countenance
the
he
sank
on
his
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
murmuring
on
his
part
the
name
of
louise
ah
montalais
montalais
she
sighed
it
is
very
wicked
to
deceive
me
so
who
i
i
have
deceived
you
yes
you
told
me
you
would
go
down
to
inquire
the
news
and
you
have
brought
up
monsieur
well
i
was
obliged
to
do
so
how
else
could
he
have
received
the
letter
you
wrote
him
and
she
pointed
with
her
finger
to
the
letter
which
was
still
upon
the
table
raoul
made
a
step
to
take
it
louise
more
rapid
although
she
had
sprung
forward
with
a
sufficiently
remarkable
physical
hesitation
reached
out
her
hand
to
stop
him
raoul
came
in
contact
with
that
trembling
hand
took
it
within
his
own
and
carried
it
so
respectfully
to
his
lips
that
he
might
have
been
said
to
have
deposited
a
sigh
upon
it
rather
than
a
kiss
in
the
meantime
mademoiselle
de
montalais
had
taken
the
letter
folded
it
carefully
as
women
do
in
three
folds
and
slipped
it
into
her
bosom
don
t
be
afraid
louise
said
she
monsieur
will
no
more
venture
to
take
it
hence
than
the
defunct
king
louis
xiii
ventured
to
take
billets
from
the
corsage
of
mademoiselle
de
hautefort
raoul
blushed
at
seeing
the
smile
of
the
two
girls
and
he
did
not
remark
that
the
hand
of
louise
remained
in
his
there
said
montalais
you
have
pardoned
me
louise
for
having
brought
monsieur
to
you
and
you
monsieur
bear
me
no
malice
for
having
followed
me
to
see
mademoiselle
now
then
peace
being
made
let
us
chat
like
old
friends
present
me
louise
to
de
bragelonne
monsieur
le
vicomte
said
louise
with
her
quiet
grace
and
ingenuous
smile
i
have
the
honor
to
present
to
you
mademoiselle
aure
de
montalais
maid
of
honor
to
her
royal
highness
madame
and
moreover
my
friend
my
excellent
friend
raoul
bowed
ceremoniously
and
me
louise
said
he
will
you
not
present
me
also
to
mademoiselle
oh
she
knows
you
she
knows
all
this
unguarded
expression
made
montalais
laugh
and
raoul
sigh
with
happiness
for
he
interpreted
it
thus
she
knows
all
our
love
the
ceremonies
being
over
monsieur
le
vicomte
said
montalais
take
a
chair
and
tell
us
quickly
the
news
you
bring
flying
thus
mademoiselle
it
is
no
longer
a
secret
the
king
on
his
way
to
poitiers
will
stop
at
blois
to
visit
his
royal
highness
the
king
here
exclaimed
montalais
clapping
her
hands
what
are
we
going
to
see
the
court
only
think
louise
the
real
court
from
paris
oh
good
heavens
but
when
will
this
happen
monsieur
perhaps
this
evening
mademoiselle
at
latest
montalais
lifted
her
shoulders
in
a
sigh
of
vexation
no
time
to
get
ready
no
time
to
prepare
a
single
dress
we
are
as
far
behind
the
fashions
as
the
poles
we
shall
look
like
portraits
from
the
time
of
henry
iv
ah
monsieur
this
is
sad
news
you
bring
us
but
mesdemoiselles
you
will
be
still
beautiful
that
s
no
news
yes
we
shall
always
be
beautiful
because
nature
has
made
us
passable
but
we
shall
be
ridiculous
because
the
fashion
will
have
forgotten
us
alas
ridiculous
i
shall
be
thought
ridiculous
i
and
by
whom
said
louise
innocently
by
whom
you
are
a
strange
girl
my
dear
is
that
a
question
to
put
to
me
i
mean
everybody
i
mean
the
courtiers
the
nobles
i
mean
the
king
pardon
me
my
good
friend
but
as
here
every
one
is
accustomed
to
see
us
as
we
are
granted
but
that
is
about
to
change
and
we
shall
be
ridiculous
even
for
blois
for
close
to
us
will
be
seen
the
fashions
from
paris
and
they
will
perceive
that
we
are
in
the
fashion
of
blois
it
is
enough
to
make
one
despair
console
yourself
mademoiselle
well
so
let
it
be
after
all
so
much
the
worse
for
those
who
do
not
find
me
to
their
taste
said
montalais
philosophically
they
would
be
very
difficult
to
please
replied
raoul
faithful
to
his
regular
system
of
gallantry
thank
you
monsieur
le
vicomte
we
were
saying
then
that
the
king
is
coming
to
blois
with
all
the
court
mesdemoiselles
de
mancini
will
they
be
with
them
no
certainly
not
but
as
the
king
it
is
said
can
not
do
without
mademoiselle
mary
mademoiselle
the
king
must
do
without
her
le
cardinal
will
have
it
so
he
has
exiled
his
nieces
to
brouage
he
the
hypocrite
hush
said
louise
pressing
a
finger
on
her
friend
s
rosy
lips
bah
nobody
can
hear
me
i
say
that
old
mazarino
mazarini
is
a
hypocrite
who
burns
impatiently
to
make
his
niece
queen
of
france
that
can
not
be
mademoiselle
since
le
cardinal
on
the
contrary
had
brought
about
the
marriage
of
his
majesty
with
the
infanta
maria
theresa
montalais
looked
raoul
full
in
the
face
and
said
and
do
you
parisians
believe
in
these
tales
well
we
are
a
little
more
knowing
than
you
at
blois
mademoiselle
if
the
king
goes
beyond
poitiers
and
sets
out
for
spain
if
the
articles
of
the
marriage
contract
are
agreed
upon
by
don
luis
de
haro
and
his
eminence
you
must
plainly
perceive
that
it
is
not
child
s
play
all
very
fine
but
the
king
is
king
i
suppose
no
doubt
mademoiselle
but
the
cardinal
is
the
cardinal
the
king
is
not
a
man
then
and
he
does
not
love
mary
mancini
he
adores
her
well
he
will
marry
her
then
we
shall
have
war
with
spain
mazarin
will
spend
a
few
of
the
millions
he
has
put
away
our
gentlemen
will
perform
prodigies
of
valor
in
their
encounters
with
the
proud
castilians
and
many
of
them
will
return
crowned
with
laurels
to
be
recrowned
by
us
with
myrtles
now
that
is
my
view
of
politics
montalais
you
are
wild
said
louise
and
every
exaggeration
attracts
you
as
light
does
a
moth
louise
you
are
so
extremely
reasonable
that
you
will
never
know
how
to
love
oh
said
louise
in
a
tone
of
tender
reproach
don
t
you
see
montalais
the
desires
to
marry
her
son
to
the
infanta
would
you
wish
him
to
disobey
his
mother
is
it
for
a
royal
heart
like
his
to
set
such
a
bad
example
when
parents
forbid
love
love
must
be
banished
and
louise
sighed
raoul
cast
down
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
constraint
montalais
on
her
part
laughed
aloud
well
i
have
no
parents
said
she
you
are
acquainted
without
doubt
with
the
state
of
health
of
le
comte
de
la
fere
said
louise
after
breathing
that
sigh
which
had
revealed
so
many
griefs
in
its
eloquent
utterance
no
mademoiselle
replied
raoul
i
have
not
let
paid
my
respects
to
my
father
i
was
going
to
his
house
when
mademoiselle
de
montalais
so
kindly
stopped
me
i
hope
the
comte
is
well
you
have
heard
nothing
to
the
contrary
have
you
no
raoul
nothing
thank
god
here
for
several
instants
ensued
a
silence
during
which
two
spirits
which
followed
the
same
idea
communicated
perfectly
without
even
the
assistance
of
a
single
glance
oh
heavens
exclaimed
montalais
in
a
fright
there
is
somebody
coming
up
who
can
it
be
said
louise
rising
in
great
agitation
mesdemoiselles
i
inconvenience
you
very
much
i
have
without
doubt
been
very
indiscreet
stammered
raoul
very
ill
at
ease
it
is
a
heavy
step
said
louise
ah
if
it
is
only
malicorne
added
montalais
do
not
disturb
yourselves
louise
and
raoul
looked
at
each
other
to
inquire
who
malicorne
could
be
there
is
no
occasion
to
mind
him
continued
montalais
he
is
not
jealous
but
mademoiselle
said
raoul
yes
i
understand
well
he
is
discreet
as
i
am
good
heavens
cried
louise
who
had
applied
her
ear
to
the
door
which
had
been
left
ajar
it
is
my
mother
s
step
madame
de
where
shall
i
hide
myself
exclaimed
raoul
catching
at
the
dress
of
montalais
who
looked
quite
bewildered
yes
said
she
yes
i
know
the
clicking
of
those
pattens
it
is
our
excellent
mother
le
vicomte
what
a
pity
it
is
the
window
looks
upon
a
stone
pavement
and
that
fifty
paces
below
it
raoul
glanced
at
the
balcony
in
despair
louise
seized
his
arm
and
held
it
tight
oh
how
silly
i
am
said
montalais
have
i
not
the
closet
it
looks
as
if
it
were
made
on
purpose
it
was
quite
time
to
act
madame
de
was
coming
up
at
a
quicker
pace
than
usual
she
gained
the
landing
at
the
moment
when
montalais
as
in
all
scenes
of
surprises
shut
the
closet
by
leaning
with
her
back
against
the
door
ah
cried
madame
de
you
are
here
are
you
louise
yes
madame
replied
she
more
pale
than
if
she
had
committed
a
great
crime
well
well
pray
be
seated
madame
said
montalais
offering
her
a
chair
which
she
placed
so
that
the
back
was
towards
the
closet
thank
you
mademoiselle
aure
thank
you
come
my
child
be
quick
where
do
you
wish
me
to
go
madame
why
home
to
be
sure
have
you
not
to
prepare
your
toilette
what
did
you
say
cried
montalais
hastening
to
affect
surprise
so
fearful
was
she
that
louise
would
in
some
way
commit
herself
you
don
t
know
the
news
then
said
madame
de
what
news
madame
is
it
possible
for
two
girls
to
learn
up
in
this
what
have
you
seen
nobody
madame
you
talk
in
enigmas
and
you
torment
us
at
a
slow
fire
cried
montalais
who
terrified
at
seeing
louise
become
paler
and
paler
did
not
know
to
what
saint
to
put
up
her
vows
at
length
she
caught
an
eloquent
look
of
her
companion
s
one
of
those
looks
which
would
convey
intelligence
to
a
brick
wall
louise
directed
her
attention
to
a
hat
raoul
s
unlucky
hat
which
was
set
out
in
all
its
feathery
splendor
upon
the
table
montalais
sprang
towards
it
and
seizing
it
with
her
left
hand
passed
it
behind
her
into
the
right
concealing
it
as
she
was
speaking
well
said
madame
de
a
courier
has
arrived
announcing
the
approach
of
the
king
there
mesdemoiselles
there
is
something
to
make
you
put
on
your
best
looks
quick
quick
cried
montalais
follow
madame
your
mother
louise
and
leave
me
to
get
ready
my
dress
of
ceremony
louise
arose
her
mother
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
out
on
to
the
landing
come
along
said
she
then
adding
in
a
low
voice
when
i
forbid
you
to
come
the
apartment
of
montalais
why
do
you
do
so
madame
she
is
my
friend
besides
i
had
but
just
come
did
you
see
nobody
concealed
while
you
were
there
madame
i
saw
a
man
s
hat
i
tell
you
the
hat
of
that
fellow
that
madame
repeated
louise
of
that
malicorne
a
maid
of
honor
to
have
such
company
fie
fie
and
their
voices
were
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
narrow
staircase
montalais
had
not
missed
a
word
of
this
conversation
which
echo
conveyed
to
her
as
if
through
a
tunnel
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
on
seeing
raoul
who
had
listened
likewise
issue
from
the
closet
poor
montalais
said
she
the
victim
of
friendship
poor
malicorne
the
victim
of
love
she
stopped
on
viewing
the
face
of
raoul
who
was
vexed
at
having
in
one
day
surprised
so
many
secrets
oh
mademoiselle
said
he
how
can
we
repay
your
kindness
oh
we
will
balance
accounts
some
day
said
she
for
the
present
begone
de
bragelonne
for
madame
de
is
not
over
indulgent
and
any
indiscretion
on
her
part
might
bring
hither
a
domiciliary
visit
which
would
be
disagreeable
to
all
parties
but
louise
how
shall
i
know
begone
begone
king
louis
xi
knew
very
well
what
he
was
about
when
he
invented
the
post
alas
sighed
raoul
and
am
i
not
here
i
who
am
worth
all
the
posts
in
the
kingdom
quick
i
say
to
horse
so
that
if
madame
de
should
return
for
the
purpose
of
preaching
me
a
lesson
on
morality
she
may
not
find
you
here
she
would
tell
my
father
would
she
not
murmured
raoul
and
you
would
be
scolded
ah
vicomte
it
is
very
plain
you
come
from
court
you
are
as
timid
as
the
king
peste
at
blois
we
contrive
better
than
that
to
do
without
papa
s
consent
ask
malicorne
else
and
at
these
words
the
girl
pushed
raoul
out
of
the
room
by
the
shoulders
he
glided
swiftly
down
to
the
porch
regained
his
horse
mounted
and
set
off
as
if
he
had
had
monsieur
s
guards
at
his
heels
chapter
iv
father
and
son
raoul
followed
the
road
so
dear
to
his
memory
which
led
from
blois
to
the
residence
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
the
reader
will
dispense
with
a
second
description
of
that
habitation
he
perhaps
has
been
with
us
there
before
and
knows
it
only
since
our
last
journey
thither
the
walls
had
taken
on
a
grayer
tint
and
the
assumed
a
more
harmonious
copper
tone
the
trees
had
grown
and
many
that
then
only
stretched
their
slender
branches
along
the
tops
of
the
hedges
now
bushy
strong
and
luxuriant
cast
around
beneath
boughs
swollen
with
sap
great
shadows
of
blossoms
or
fruit
for
the
benefit
of
the
traveler
raoul
perceived
from
a
distance
the
two
little
turrets
the
in
the
elms
and
the
flights
of
pigeons
which
wheeled
incessantly
around
that
brick
cone
seemingly
without
power
to
quit
it
like
the
sweet
memories
which
hover
round
a
spirit
at
peace
as
he
approached
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
pulleys
which
grated
under
the
weight
of
the
heavy
pails
he
also
fancied
he
heard
the
melancholy
moaning
of
the
water
which
falls
back
again
into
the
wells
a
sad
funereal
solemn
sound
which
strikes
the
ear
of
the
child
and
the
poet
both
dreamers
which
the
english
call
splash
arabian
poets
gasgachau
and
which
we
frenchmen
who
would
be
poets
can
only
translate
by
a
paraphrase
the
noise
of
water
falling
into
water
it
was
more
than
a
year
since
raoul
had
been
to
visit
his
father
he
had
passed
the
whole
time
in
the
household
of
le
prince
in
fact
after
all
the
commotions
of
the
fronde
of
the
early
period
of
which
we
formerly
attempted
to
give
a
sketch
louis
de
conde
had
made
a
public
solemn
and
frank
reconciliation
with
the
court
during
all
the
time
that
the
rupture
between
the
king
and
the
prince
had
lasted
the
prince
who
had
long
entertained
a
great
regard
for
bragelonne
had
in
vain
offered
him
advantages
of
the
most
dazzling
kind
for
a
young
man
the
comte
de
la
fere
still
faithful
to
his
principles
of
loyalty
and
royalty
one
day
developed
before
his
son
in
the
vaults
of
saint
denis
the
comte
de
la
fere
in
the
name
of
his
son
had
always
declined
them
moreover
instead
of
following
de
conde
in
his
rebellion
the
vicomte
had
followed
de
turenne
fighting
for
the
king
then
when
de
turenne
in
his
turn
had
appeared
to
abandon
the
royal
cause
he
had
quitted
de
turenne
as
he
had
quitted
de
conde
it
resulted
from
this
invariable
line
of
conduct
that
as
conde
and
turenne
had
never
been
conquerors
of
each
other
but
under
the
standard
of
the
king
raoul
however
young
had
ten
victories
inscribed
on
his
list
of
services
and
not
one
defeat
from
which
his
bravery
or
conscience
had
to
suffer
raoul
therefore
had
in
compliance
with
the
wish
of
his
father
served
obstinately
and
passively
the
fortunes
of
louis
in
spite
of
the
tergiversations
which
were
endemic
and
it
might
be
said
inevitable
at
that
period
de
conde
on
being
restored
to
favor
had
at
once
availed
himself
of
all
the
privileges
of
the
amnesty
to
ask
for
many
things
back
again
which
had
been
granted
to
him
before
and
among
others
raoul
de
la
fere
with
his
invariable
good
sense
had
immediately
sent
him
again
to
the
prince
a
year
then
had
passed
away
since
the
separation
of
the
father
and
son
a
few
letters
had
softened
but
not
removed
the
pain
of
absence
we
have
seen
that
raoul
had
left
at
blois
another
love
in
addition
to
filial
love
but
let
us
do
him
this
justice
if
it
had
not
been
for
chance
and
mademoiselle
de
montalais
two
great
temptations
raoul
after
delivering
his
message
would
have
galloped
off
towards
his
father
s
house
turning
his
head
round
perhaps
but
without
stopping
for
a
single
instant
even
if
louise
had
held
out
her
arms
to
him
so
the
first
part
of
the
journey
was
given
by
raoul
to
regretting
the
past
which
he
had
been
forced
to
quit
so
quickly
that
is
to
say
his
and
the
other
part
to
the
friend
he
was
about
to
join
so
much
too
slowly
for
his
wishes
raoul
found
the
open
and
rode
straight
in
without
regarding
the
long
arms
raised
in
anger
of
an
old
man
dressed
in
a
jacket
of
wool
and
a
large
cap
of
faded
velvet
the
old
man
who
was
weeding
with
his
hands
a
bed
of
dwarf
roses
and
arguerites
was
indignant
at
seeing
a
horse
thus
traversing
his
sanded
and
walks
he
even
ventured
a
vigorous
humph
which
made
the
cavalier
turn
round
then
there
was
a
change
of
scene
for
no
sooner
had
he
caught
sight
of
raoul
s
face
than
the
old
man
sprang
up
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
house
amidst
interrupted
growlings
which
appeared
to
be
paroxysms
of
wild
delight
when
arrived
at
the
stables
raoul
gave
his
horse
to
a
little
lackey
and
sprang
up
the
perron
with
an
ardor
that
would
have
delighted
the
heart
of
his
father
he
crossed
the
the
and
the
salon
without
meeting
any
one
at
length
on
reaching
the
door
of
de
la
fere
s
apartment
he
rapped
impatiently
and
entered
almost
without
waiting
for
the
word
enter
which
was
vouchsafed
him
by
a
voice
at
once
sweet
and
serious
the
comte
was
seated
at
a
table
covered
with
papers
and
books
he
was
still
the
noble
handsome
gentleman
of
former
days
but
time
had
given
to
this
nobleness
and
beauty
a
more
solemn
and
distinct
character
a
brow
white
and
void
of
wrinkles
beneath
his
long
hair
now
more
white
than
black
an
eye
piercing
and
mild
under
the
lids
of
a
young
man
his
mustache
fine
but
slightly
grizzled
waved
over
lips
of
a
pure
and
delicate
model
as
if
they
had
never
been
curled
by
mortal
passions
a
form
straight
and
supple
an
irreproachable
but
thin
hand
this
was
what
remained
of
the
illustrious
gentleman
whom
so
many
illustrious
mouths
had
praised
under
the
name
of
athos
he
was
engaged
in
correcting
the
pages
of
a
manuscript
book
entirely
filled
by
his
own
hand
raoul
seized
his
father
by
the
shoulders
by
the
neck
as
he
could
and
embraced
him
so
tenderly
and
so
rapidly
that
the
comte
had
neither
strength
nor
time
to
disengage
himself
or
to
overcome
his
paternal
emotions
what
you
here
raoul
you
is
it
possible
said
he
oh
monsieur
monsieur
what
joy
to
see
you
once
again
but
you
don
t
answer
me
vicomte
have
you
leave
of
absence
or
has
some
misfortune
happened
at
paris
thank
god
monsieur
replied
raoul
calming
himself
by
degrees
nothing
has
happened
but
what
is
fortunate
the
king
is
going
to
be
married
as
i
had
the
honor
of
informing
you
in
my
last
letter
and
on
his
way
to
spain
he
will
pass
through
blois
to
pay
a
visit
to
monsieur
yes
monsieur
le
comte
so
fearing
to
find
him
unprepared
or
wishing
to
be
particularly
polite
to
him
monsieur
le
prince
sent
me
forward
to
have
the
lodgings
ready
you
have
seen
monsieur
asked
the
comte
eagerly
i
have
had
that
honor
at
the
castle
yes
monsieur
replied
raoul
casting
down
his
eyes
because
no
doubt
he
had
felt
there
was
something
more
than
curiosity
in
the
comte
s
inquiries
ah
indeed
vicomte
accept
my
compliments
thereupon
raoul
bowed
but
you
have
seen
some
one
else
at
blois
monsieur
i
saw
her
royal
highness
madame
that
s
very
well
but
it
is
not
madame
that
i
mean
raoul
colored
deeply
but
made
no
reply
you
do
not
appear
to
understand
me
monsieur
le
vicomte
persisted
de
la
fere
without
accenting
his
words
more
strongly
but
with
a
rather
severer
look
i
understand
you
quite
plainly
monsieur
replied
raoul
and
if
i
hesitate
a
little
in
my
reply
you
are
well
assured
i
am
not
seeking
for
a
falsehood
no
you
can
not
tell
a
lie
and
that
makes
me
so
astonished
you
should
be
so
long
in
saying
yes
or
no
i
can
not
answer
you
without
understanding
you
very
well
and
if
i
have
understood
you
you
will
take
my
first
words
in
ill
part
you
will
displeased
no
doubt
monsieur
le
comte
because
i
have
seen
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
have
you
not
it
was
of
her
you
meant
to
speak
i
know
very
well
monsieur
said
raoul
with
inexpressible
sweetness
and
i
asked
you
if
you
have
seen
her
monsieur
i
was
ignorant
when
i
entered
the
castle
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
was
there
it
was
only
on
my
return
after
i
had
performed
my
mission
that
chance
brought
us
together
i
have
had
the
honor
of
paying
my
respects
to
her
but
what
do
you
call
the
chance
that
led
you
into
the
presence
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
mademoiselle
de
montalais
monsieur
and
who
is
mademoiselle
de
montalais
a
young
lady
i
did
not
know
before
whom
i
had
never
seen
she
is
maid
of
honor
to
madame
monsieur
le
vicomte
i
will
push
my
interrogatory
no
further
and
reproach
myself
with
having
carried
it
so
far
i
had
desired
you
to
avoid
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
not
to
see
her
without
my
permission
oh
i
am
quite
sure
you
have
told
me
the
truth
and
that
you
took
no
measures
to
approach
her
chance
has
done
me
this
injury
i
do
not
accuse
you
of
it
i
will
be
content
then
with
what
i
formerly
said
to
you
concerning
this
young
lady
i
do
not
reproach
her
with
anything
god
is
my
witness
only
it
is
not
my
intention
or
wish
that
you
should
frequent
her
place
of
residence
i
beg
you
once
more
my
dear
raoul
to
understand
that
it
was
plain
the
limpid
eyes
of
raoul
were
troubled
at
this
speech
now
my
friend
said
the
comte
with
his
soft
smile
and
in
his
customary
tone
let
us
talk
of
other
matters
you
are
returning
perhaps
to
your
duty
no
monsieur
i
have
no
duty
for
except
the
pleasure
of
remaining
with
you
the
prince
kindly
appointed
me
no
other
which
was
so
much
in
accord
with
my
wish
is
the
king
well
perfectly
and
monsieur
le
prince
also
as
usual
monsieur
the
comte
forgot
to
inquire
after
mazarin
that
was
an
old
habit
well
raoul
since
you
are
entirely
mine
i
will
give
up
my
whole
day
to
you
embrace
me
again
again
you
are
at
home
vicomte
ah
there
is
our
old
grimaud
come
in
grimaud
monsieur
le
vicomte
is
desirous
of
embracing
you
likewise
the
good
old
man
did
not
require
to
be
twice
told
he
rushed
in
with
open
arms
raoul
meeting
him
now
if
you
please
we
will
go
into
the
garden
raoul
i
will
show
you
the
new
lodging
i
have
had
prepared
for
you
during
your
leave
of
absence
and
whilst
examining
the
last
winter
s
plantations
and
two
i
have
just
acquired
you
will
give
me
all
the
news
of
our
friends
in
paris
the
comte
closed
his
manuscript
took
the
young
man
s
arm
and
went
out
into
the
gardens
with
him
grimaud
looked
at
raoul
with
a
melancholy
air
as
the
young
man
passed
out
observing
that
his
head
nearly
touched
the
traverse
of
the
doorway
stroking
his
white
royale
he
slowly
murmured
how
he
has
grown
chapter
in
which
something
will
be
said
of
cropoli
whilst
the
comte
de
la
fere
with
raoul
visits
the
new
buildings
he
has
erected
and
the
new
horses
he
has
bought
with
the
reader
s
permission
we
will
lead
him
back
to
the
city
of
blois
and
make
him
a
witness
of
the
unaccustomed
activity
which
pervades
that
city
it
was
in
the
hotels
that
the
surprise
of
the
news
brought
by
raoul
was
most
sensibly
felt
in
fact
the
king
and
the
court
at
blois
that
is
to
say
a
hundred
horsemen
ten
carriages
two
hundred
horses
as
many
lackeys
as
masters
where
was
this
crowd
to
be
housed
where
were
to
be
lodged
all
the
gentry
of
the
neighborhood
who
would
gather
in
two
or
three
hours
after
the
news
had
enlarged
the
circle
of
its
report
like
the
increasing
circumferences
produced
by
a
stone
thrown
into
a
placid
lake
blois
as
peaceful
in
the
morning
as
we
have
seen
as
the
calmest
lake
in
the
world
at
the
announcement
of
the
royal
arrival
was
suddenly
filled
with
the
tumult
and
buzzing
of
a
swarm
of
bees
all
the
servants
of
the
castle
under
the
inspection
of
the
officers
were
sent
into
the
city
in
quest
of
provisions
and
ten
horsemen
were
dispatched
to
the
preserves
of
chambord
to
seek
for
game
to
the
fisheries
of
beuvron
for
fish
and
to
the
gardens
of
cheverny
for
fruits
and
flowers
precious
tapestries
and
lusters
with
great
gilt
chains
were
drawn
from
the
cupboards
an
army
of
the
poor
were
engaged
in
sweeping
the
courts
and
washing
the
stone
fronts
whilst
their
wives
went
in
droves
to
the
meadows
beyond
the
loire
to
gather
green
boughs
and
the
whole
city
not
to
be
behind
in
this
luxury
of
cleanliness
assumed
its
best
toilette
with
the
help
of
brushes
brooms
and
water
the
gutters
of
the
upper
town
swollen
by
these
continued
ablutions
became
rivers
at
the
bottom
of
the
city
and
the
pavement
generally
very
muddy
it
must
be
allowed
took
a
clean
face
and
absolutely
shone
in
the
friendly
rays
of
the
sun
next
the
music
was
to
be
provided
drawers
were
emptied
the
did
a
glorious
trade
in
wax
ribbons
and
housekeepers
laid
in
stores
of
bread
meat
and
spices
already
numbers
of
the
citizens
whose
houses
were
furnished
as
if
for
a
siege
having
nothing
more
to
do
donned
their
festive
clothes
and
directed
their
course
towards
the
city
gate
in
order
to
be
the
first
to
signal
or
see
the
cortege
they
knew
very
well
that
the
king
would
not
arrive
before
night
perhaps
not
before
the
next
morning
yet
what
is
expectation
but
a
kind
of
folly
and
what
is
that
folly
but
an
excess
of
hope
in
the
lower
city
at
scarcely
a
hundred
paces
from
the
castle
of
the
states
between
the
mall
and
the
castle
in
a
sufficiently
handsome
street
then
called
the
rue
vieille
and
which
must
in
fact
have
been
very
old
stood
a
venerable
edifice
with
pointed
gables
of
squat
but
large
dimensions
ornamented
with
three
windows
looking
into
the
street
on
the
first
floor
with
two
in
the
second
and
with
a
little
oeil
de
boeuf
in
the
third
on
the
sides
of
this
triangle
had
recently
been
constructed
a
parallelogram
of
considerable
size
which
encroached
upon
the
street
remorselessly
according
to
the
familiar
uses
of
the
building
of
that
period
the
street
was
narrowed
by
a
quarter
by
it
but
then
the
house
was
enlarged
by
a
half
and
was
not
that
a
sufficient
compensation
tradition
said
that
this
house
with
the
pointed
gables
was
inhabited
in
the
time
of
henry
by
a
councilor
of
state
whom
queen
catherine
came
some
say
to
visit
and
others
to
strangle
however
that
may
be
the
good
lady
must
have
stepped
with
a
circumspect
foot
over
the
threshold
of
this
building
after
the
councilor
had
died
whether
by
strangulation
or
naturally
is
of
no
consequence
the
house
had
been
sold
then
abandoned
and
lastly
isolated
from
the
other
houses
of
the
street
towards
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiii
only
an
italian
named
cropoli
escaped
from
the
kitchens
of
the
marechal
d
ancre
came
and
took
possession
of
this
house
there
he
established
a
little
hostelry
in
which
was
fabricated
a
macaroni
so
delicious
that
people
came
from
miles
round
to
fetch
it
or
eat
it
so
famous
had
the
house
become
for
it
that
when
mary
de
medici
was
a
prisoner
as
we
know
in
the
castle
of
blois
she
once
sent
for
some
it
was
precisely
on
the
day
she
had
escaped
by
the
famous
window
the
dish
of
macaroni
was
left
upon
the
table
only
just
tasted
by
the
royal
mouth
this
double
favor
of
a
strangulation
and
a
macaroni
conferred
upon
the
triangular
house
gave
poor
cropoli
a
fancy
to
grace
his
hostelry
with
a
pompous
title
but
his
quality
of
an
italian
was
no
recommendation
in
these
times
and
his
small
fortune
forbade
attracting
too
much
attention
when
he
found
himself
about
to
die
which
happened
in
just
after
the
death
of
louis
he
called
to
him
his
son
a
young
cook
of
great
promise
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
recommended
him
to
preserve
carefully
the
secret
of
the
macaroni
to
frenchify
his
name
and
at
length
when
the
political
horizon
should
be
cleared
from
the
clouds
which
obscured
it
this
was
practiced
then
as
in
our
day
to
order
of
the
nearest
smith
a
handsome
sign
upon
which
a
famous
painter
whom
he
named
should
design
two
queens
portraits
with
these
words
as
a
legend
to
the
medici
the
worthy
cropoli
after
these
recommendations
had
only
sufficient
time
to
point
out
to
his
young
successor
a
chimney
under
the
slab
of
which
he
had
hidden
a
thousand
pieces
and
then
expired
cropoli
the
younger
like
a
man
of
good
heart
supported
the
loss
with
resignation
and
the
gain
without
insolence
he
began
by
accustoming
the
public
to
sound
the
final
i
of
his
name
so
little
that
by
the
aid
of
general
complaisance
he
was
soon
called
nothing
but
cropole
which
is
quite
a
french
name
he
then
married
having
had
in
his
eye
a
little
french
girl
from
whose
parents
he
extorted
a
reasonable
dowry
by
showing
them
what
there
was
beneath
the
slab
of
the
chimney
these
two
points
accomplished
he
went
in
search
of
the
painter
who
was
to
paint
the
sign
and
he
was
soon
found
he
was
an
old
italian
a
rival
of
the
raphaels
and
the
caracci
but
an
unfortunate
rival
he
said
he
was
of
the
venetian
school
doubtless
from
his
fondness
for
color
his
works
of
which
he
had
never
sold
one
attracted
the
eye
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
but
they
so
formidably
displeased
the
citizens
that
he
had
finished
by
painting
no
more
he
boasted
of
having
painted
a
for
madame
la
marechale
d
ancre
and
mourned
over
this
chamber
having
been
burnt
at
the
time
of
the
marechal
s
disaster
cropoli
in
his
character
of
a
compatriot
was
indulgent
towards
pittrino
which
was
the
name
of
the
artist
perhaps
he
had
seen
the
famous
pictures
of
the
be
this
as
it
may
he
held
in
such
esteem
we
may
say
in
such
friendship
the
famous
pittrino
that
he
took
him
in
his
own
house
pittrino
grateful
and
fed
with
macaroni
set
about
propagating
the
reputation
of
this
national
dish
and
from
the
time
of
its
founder
he
had
rendered
with
his
indefatigable
tongue
signal
services
to
the
house
of
cropoli
as
he
grew
old
he
attached
himself
to
the
son
as
he
had
done
to
the
father
and
by
degrees
became
a
kind
of
of
a
house
in
which
his
remarkable
integrity
his
acknowledged
sobriety
and
a
thousand
other
virtues
useless
to
enumerate
gave
him
an
eternal
place
by
the
fireside
with
a
right
of
inspection
over
the
domestics
besides
this
it
was
he
who
tasted
the
macaroni
to
maintain
the
pure
flavor
of
the
ancient
tradition
and
it
must
be
allowed
that
he
never
permitted
a
grain
of
pepper
too
much
or
an
atom
of
parmesan
too
little
his
joy
was
at
its
height
on
that
day
when
called
upon
to
share
the
secret
of
cropoli
the
younger
and
to
paint
the
famous
sign
he
was
seen
at
once
rummaging
with
ardor
in
an
old
box
in
which
he
found
some
brushes
a
little
gnawed
by
the
rats
but
still
passable
some
in
a
bottle
and
a
palette
which
had
formerly
belonged
to
bronzino
that
dieu
de
la
pittoure
as
the
ultramontane
artist
in
his
ever
young
enthusiasm
always
called
him
pittrino
was
puffed
up
with
all
the
joy
of
a
rehabilitation
he
did
as
raphael
had
done
he
changed
his
style
and
painted
in
the
fashion
of
albani
two
goddesses
rather
than
two
queens
these
illustrious
ladies
appeared
so
lovely
on
the
sign
they
presented
to
the
astonished
eyes
such
an
assemblage
of
lilies
and
roses
the
enchanting
result
of
the
changes
of
style
in
pittrino
they
assumed
the
poses
of
sirens
so
anacreontically
that
the
principal
echevin
when
admitted
to
view
this
capital
piece
in
the
salle
of
cropole
at
once
declared
that
these
ladies
were
too
handsome
of
too
animated
a
beauty
to
figure
as
a
sign
in
the
eyes
of
to
pittrino
he
added
his
royal
highness
monsieur
who
often
comes
into
our
city
will
not
be
much
pleased
to
see
his
illustrious
mother
so
slightly
clothed
and
he
will
send
you
to
the
oubliettes
of
the
state
for
remember
the
heart
of
that
glorious
prince
is
not
always
tender
you
must
efface
either
the
two
sirens
or
the
legend
without
which
i
forbid
the
exhibition
of
the
sign
i
say
this
for
your
sake
master
cropole
as
well
for
yours
signor
pittrino
what
answer
could
be
made
to
this
it
was
necessary
to
thank
the
echevin
for
his
kindness
which
cropole
did
but
pittrino
remained
downcast
and
said
he
felt
assured
of
what
was
about
to
happen
the
visitor
was
scarcely
gone
when
cropole
crossing
his
arms
said
well
master
what
is
to
be
done
we
must
efface
the
legend
said
pittrino
in
a
melancholy
tone
i
have
some
excellent
it
will
be
done
in
a
moment
and
we
will
replace
the
medici
by
the
nymphs
or
the
sirens
whichever
you
prefer
no
said
cropole
the
will
of
my
father
must
be
carried
out
my
father
considered
he
considered
the
figures
of
the
most
importance
said
pittrino
he
thought
most
of
the
legend
said
cropole
the
proof
of
the
importance
in
which
he
held
the
figures
said
pittrino
is
that
he
desired
they
should
be
likenesses
and
they
are
so
yes
but
if
they
had
not
been
so
who
would
have
recognized
them
without
the
legend
at
the
present
day
even
when
the
memory
of
the
blaisois
begins
to
be
faint
with
regard
to
these
two
celebrated
persons
who
would
recognize
catherine
and
mary
without
the
words
to
the
medici
but
the
figures
said
pittrino
in
despair
for
he
felt
that
young
cropole
was
right
i
should
not
like
to
lose
the
fruit
of
my
labor
and
i
should
not
wish
you
to
be
thrown
into
prison
and
myself
into
the
oubliettes
let
us
efface
medici
said
pittrino
supplicatingly
no
replied
cropole
firmly
i
have
got
an
idea
a
sublime
idea
your
picture
shall
appear
and
my
legend
likewise
does
not
medici
mean
doctor
or
physician
in
italian
yes
in
the
plural
well
then
you
shall
order
another
of
the
smith
you
shall
paint
six
physicians
and
write
underneath
aux
medici
which
makes
a
very
pretty
play
upon
words
six
physicians
impossible
and
the
composition
cried
pittrino
that
is
your
business
but
so
it
shall
be
i
insist
upon
it
it
must
be
so
my
macaroni
is
burning
this
reasoning
was
peremptory
pittrino
obeyed
he
composed
the
sign
of
six
physicians
with
the
legend
the
echevin
applauded
and
authorized
it
the
sign
produced
an
extravagant
success
in
the
city
which
proves
that
poetry
has
always
been
in
the
wrong
before
citizens
as
pittrino
said
cropole
to
make
amends
to
his
hung
up
the
nymphs
of
the
preceding
sign
in
his
bedroom
which
made
madame
cropole
blush
every
time
she
looked
at
it
when
she
was
undressing
at
night
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
house
got
a
sign
and
this
is
how
the
hostelry
of
the
medici
making
a
fortune
was
found
to
be
enlarged
by
a
quarter
as
we
have
described
and
this
is
how
there
was
at
blois
a
hostelry
of
that
name
and
had
for
a
master
pittrino
chapter
vi
the
unknown
thus
founded
and
recommended
by
its
sign
the
hostelry
of
master
cropole
held
its
way
steadily
on
towards
a
solid
prosperity
it
was
not
an
immense
fortune
that
cropole
had
in
perspective
but
he
might
hope
to
double
the
thousand
louis
d
or
left
by
his
father
to
make
another
thousand
louis
by
the
sale
of
his
house
and
stock
and
at
length
to
live
happily
like
a
retired
citizen
cropole
was
anxious
for
gain
and
was
with
joy
at
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
louis
xiv
himself
his
wife
pittrino
and
two
cooks
immediately
laid
hands
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
the
and
the
so
that
as
many
lamentations
and
cries
resounded
in
the
yards
of
the
hostelry
of
the
medici
as
were
formerly
heard
in
rama
cropole
had
at
the
time
but
one
single
traveler
in
his
house
this
was
a
man
of
scarcely
thirty
years
of
age
handsome
tall
austere
or
rather
melancholy
in
all
his
gestures
and
looks
he
was
dressed
in
black
velvet
with
jet
trimmings
a
white
collar
as
plain
as
that
of
the
severest
puritan
set
off
the
whiteness
of
his
youthful
neck
a
small
mustache
scarcely
covered
his
curled
disdainful
lip
he
spoke
to
people
looking
them
full
in
the
face
without
affectation
it
is
true
but
without
scruple
so
that
the
brilliancy
of
his
black
eyes
became
so
insupportable
that
more
than
one
look
had
sunk
beneath
his
like
the
weaker
sword
in
a
single
combat
at
this
time
in
which
men
all
created
equal
by
god
were
divided
thanks
to
prejudices
into
two
distinct
castes
the
gentlemen
and
the
commoner
as
they
are
really
divided
into
two
races
the
black
and
the
white
at
this
time
we
say
he
whose
portrait
we
have
just
sketched
could
not
fail
of
being
taken
for
a
gentleman
and
of
the
best
class
to
ascertain
this
there
was
no
necessity
to
consult
anything
but
his
hands
long
slender
and
white
of
which
every
muscle
every
vein
became
apparent
through
the
skin
at
the
least
movement
and
eloquently
spoke
of
good
descent
this
gentleman
then
had
arrived
alone
at
cropole
s
house
he
had
taken
without
hesitation
without
reflection
even
the
principal
apartment
which
the
hotelier
had
pointed
out
to
him
with
a
rapacious
aim
very
praiseworthy
some
will
say
very
reprehensible
will
say
others
if
they
admit
that
cropole
was
a
physiognomist
and
judged
people
at
first
sight
this
apartment
was
that
which
composed
the
whole
front
of
the
ancient
triangular
house
a
large
salon
lighted
by
two
windows
on
the
first
stage
a
small
chamber
by
the
side
of
it
and
another
above
it
now
from
the
time
he
had
arrived
this
gentleman
had
scarcely
touched
any
repast
that
had
been
served
up
to
him
in
his
chamber
he
had
spoken
but
two
words
to
the
host
to
warn
him
that
a
traveler
of
the
name
of
parry
would
arrive
and
to
desire
that
when
he
did
he
should
be
shown
up
to
him
immediately
he
afterwards
preserved
so
profound
a
silence
that
cropole
was
almost
offended
so
much
did
he
prefer
people
who
were
good
company
this
gentleman
had
risen
early
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
this
history
begins
and
had
placed
himself
at
the
window
of
his
salon
seated
upon
the
ledge
and
leaning
upon
the
rail
of
the
balcony
gazing
sadly
but
persistently
on
both
sides
of
the
street
watching
no
doubt
for
the
arrival
of
the
traveler
he
had
mentioned
to
the
host
in
this
way
he
had
seen
the
little
cortege
of
monsieur
return
from
hunting
then
had
again
partaken
of
the
profound
tranquillity
of
the
street
absorbed
in
his
own
expectations
all
at
once
the
movement
of
the
crowd
going
to
the
meadows
couriers
setting
out
washers
of
pavement
purveyors
of
the
royal
household
gabbling
scampering
chariots
in
motion
on
the
run
and
pages
toiling
along
this
tumult
and
bustle
had
surprised
him
but
without
losing
any
of
that
impassible
and
supreme
majesty
which
gives
to
the
eagle
and
the
lion
that
serene
and
contemptuous
glance
amidst
the
hurrahs
and
shouts
of
hunters
or
the
curious
soon
the
cries
of
the
victims
slaughtered
in
the
the
hasty
steps
of
madame
cropole
up
that
little
wooden
staircase
so
narrow
and
so
echoing
the
bounding
pace
of
pittrino
who
only
that
morning
was
smoking
at
the
door
with
all
the
phlegm
of
a
dutchman
all
this
communicated
something
like
surprise
and
agitation
to
the
traveler
as
he
was
rising
to
make
inquiries
the
door
of
his
chamber
opened
the
unknown
concluded
they
were
about
to
introduce
the
impatiently
expected
traveler
and
made
three
precipitate
steps
to
meet
him
but
instead
of
the
person
he
expected
it
was
master
cropole
who
appeared
and
behind
him
in
the
staircase
the
pleasant
face
of
madame
cropole
rendered
trivial
by
curiosity
she
only
gave
one
furtive
glance
at
the
handsome
gentleman
and
disappeared
cropole
advanced
cap
in
hand
rather
bent
than
bowing
a
gesture
of
the
unknown
interrogated
him
without
a
word
being
pronounced
monsieur
said
cropole
i
come
to
ask
how
what
ought
i
to
say
your
lordship
monsieur
le
comte
or
monsieur
le
marquis
say
monsieur
and
speak
quickly
replied
the
unknown
with
that
haughty
accent
which
admits
of
neither
discussion
nor
reply
i
came
then
to
inquire
how
monsieur
had
passed
the
night
and
if
monsieur
intended
to
keep
this
apartment
yes
monsieur
something
has
happened
upon
which
we
could
not
reckon
what
his
majesty
louis
xiv
will
enter
our
city
and
will
remain
here
one
day
perhaps
two
great
astonishment
was
painted
on
the
countenance
of
the
unknown
the
king
of
france
is
coming
to
blois
he
is
on
the
road
monsieur
then
there
is
the
stronger
reason
for
my
remaining
said
the
unknown
very
well
but
will
monsieur
keep
all
the
apartments
i
do
not
understand
you
why
should
i
require
less
than
yesterday
because
monsieur
your
lordship
will
permit
me
to
say
yesterday
i
did
not
think
proper
when
you
chose
your
lodging
to
fix
any
price
that
might
have
made
your
lordship
believe
that
i
prejudged
your
resources
whilst
the
unknown
colored
the
idea
at
once
struck
him
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
poor
and
was
being
insulted
whilst
replied
he
coldly
you
do
not
prejudge
monsieur
i
am
a
man
thank
god
and
simple
hotelier
as
i
am
there
is
in
me
the
blood
of
a
gentleman
my
father
was
a
servant
and
officer
of
the
late
marechal
d
ancre
god
rest
his
soul
i
do
not
contest
that
point
with
you
i
only
wish
to
know
and
that
quickly
to
what
your
questions
tend
you
are
too
reasonable
monsieur
not
to
comprehend
that
our
city
is
small
that
the
court
is
about
to
invade
it
that
the
houses
will
be
overflowing
with
inhabitants
and
that
lodgings
will
consequently
obtain
considerable
prices
again
the
unknown
colored
name
your
terms
said
he
i
name
them
with
scruple
monsieur
because
i
seek
an
honest
gain
and
that
i
wish
to
carry
on
my
business
without
being
uncivil
or
extravagant
in
my
demands
now
the
room
you
occupy
is
considerable
and
you
are
alone
that
is
my
business
oh
certainly
i
do
not
mean
to
turn
monsieur
out
the
blood
rushed
to
the
temples
of
the
unknown
he
darted
at
poor
cropole
the
descendant
of
one
of
the
officers
of
the
marechal
d
ancre
a
glance
that
would
have
crushed
him
down
to
beneath
that
famous
if
cropole
had
not
been
nailed
to
the
spot
by
the
question
of
his
own
proper
interests
do
you
desire
me
to
go
said
he
explain
yourself
but
quickly
monsieur
monsieur
you
do
not
understand
me
it
is
very
critical
i
know
that
which
i
am
doing
i
express
myself
badly
or
perhaps
as
monsieur
is
a
foreigner
which
i
perceive
by
his
accent
in
fact
the
unknown
spoke
with
that
impetuosity
which
is
the
principal
character
of
english
accentuation
even
among
men
who
speak
the
french
language
with
the
greatest
purity
as
monsieur
is
a
foreigner
i
say
it
is
perhaps
he
who
does
not
catch
my
exact
meaning
i
wish
for
monsieur
to
give
up
one
or
two
of
the
apartments
he
occupies
which
would
diminish
his
expenses
and
ease
my
conscience
indeed
it
is
hard
to
increase
unreasonably
the
price
of
the
chambers
when
one
has
had
the
honor
to
let
them
at
a
reasonable
price
how
much
does
the
hire
amount
to
since
yesterday
monsieur
to
one
louis
with
refreshments
and
the
charge
for
the
horse
very
well
and
that
of
ah
there
is
the
difficulty
this
is
the
day
of
the
king
s
arrival
if
the
court
comes
to
sleep
here
the
charge
of
the
day
is
reckoned
from
that
it
results
that
three
chambers
at
two
louis
each
make
six
louis
two
louis
monsieur
are
not
much
but
six
louis
make
a
great
deal
the
unknown
from
red
as
we
have
seen
him
became
very
pale
he
drew
from
his
pocket
with
heroic
bravery
a
purse
embroidered
with
a
which
he
carefully
concealed
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
this
purse
was
of
a
thinness
a
flabbiness
a
hollowness
which
did
not
escape
the
eye
of
cropole
the
unknown
emptied
the
purse
into
his
hand
it
contained
three
double
louis
which
amounted
to
the
six
louis
demanded
by
the
host
but
it
was
seven
that
cropole
had
required
he
looked
therefore
at
the
unknown
as
much
as
to
say
and
then
there
remains
one
louis
does
there
not
master
hotelier
yes
monsieur
but
the
unknown
plunged
his
hand
into
the
pocket
of
his
and
emptied
it
it
contained
a
small
a
gold
key
and
some
silver
with
this
change
he
made
up
a
louis
thank
you
monsieur
said
cropole
it
now
only
remains
for
me
to
ask
whether
monsieur
intends
to
occupy
his
apartments
in
which
case
i
will
reserve
them
for
him
whereas
if
monsieur
does
not
mean
to
do
so
i
will
promise
them
to
some
of
the
king
s
people
who
are
coming
that
is
but
right
said
the
unknown
after
a
long
silence
but
as
i
have
no
more
money
as
you
have
seen
and
as
i
yet
must
retain
the
apartments
you
must
either
sell
this
diamond
in
the
city
or
hold
it
in
pledge
cropole
looked
at
the
diamond
so
long
that
the
unknown
said
hastily
i
prefer
your
selling
it
monsieur
for
it
is
worth
three
hundred
pistoles
a
jew
are
there
any
jews
in
blois
would
give
you
two
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
it
take
whatever
may
be
offered
for
it
if
it
be
no
more
than
the
price
of
your
lodging
begone
oh
monsieur
replied
cropole
ashamed
of
the
sudden
inferiority
which
the
unknown
reflected
upon
him
by
this
noble
and
disinterested
confidence
as
well
as
by
the
unalterable
patience
opposed
to
so
many
suspicions
and
evasions
oh
monsieur
i
hope
people
are
not
so
dishonest
at
blois
as
you
seem
to
think
and
that
the
diamond
being
worth
what
you
say
the
unknown
here
again
darted
at
cropole
one
of
his
withering
glances
i
really
do
not
understand
diamonds
monsieur
i
assure
you
cried
he
but
the
jewelers
do
ask
them
said
the
unknown
now
i
believe
our
accounts
are
settled
are
they
not
monsieur
l
hote
yes
monsieur
and
to
my
profound
regret
for
i
fear
i
have
offended
monsieur
not
at
all
replied
the
unknown
with
ineffable
majesty
or
have
appeared
to
be
extortionate
with
a
noble
traveler
consider
monsieur
the
peculiarity
of
the
case
say
no
more
about
it
i
desire
and
leave
me
to
myself
cropole
bowed
profoundly
and
left
the
room
with
a
stupefied
air
which
announced
that
he
had
a
good
heart
and
felt
genuine
remorse
the
unknown
himself
shut
the
door
after
him
and
when
left
alone
looked
mournfully
at
the
bottom
of
the
purse
from
which
he
had
taken
a
small
silken
bag
containing
the
diamond
his
last
resource
he
dwelt
likewise
upon
the
emptiness
of
his
pockets
turned
over
the
papers
in
his
and
convinced
himself
of
the
state
of
absolute
destitution
in
which
he
was
about
to
be
plunged
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
heaven
with
a
sublime
emotion
of
despairing
calmness
brushed
off
with
his
hand
some
drops
of
sweat
which
trickled
over
his
noble
brow
and
then
cast
down
upon
the
earth
a
look
which
just
before
had
been
impressed
with
almost
divine
majesty
that
the
storm
had
passed
far
from
him
perhaps
he
had
prayed
in
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
drew
near
to
the
window
resumed
his
place
in
the
balcony
and
remained
there
motionless
annihilated
dead
till
the
moment
when
the
heavens
beginning
to
darken
the
first
flambeaux
traversed
the
enlivened
street
and
gave
the
signal
for
illumination
to
all
the
windows
of
the
city
chapter
vii
parry
whilst
the
unknown
was
viewing
these
lights
with
interest
and
lending
an
ear
to
the
various
noises
master
cropole
entered
his
apartment
followed
by
two
attendants
who
laid
the
cloth
for
his
meal
the
stranger
did
not
pay
them
the
least
attention
but
cropole
approaching
him
respectfully
whispered
monsieur
the
diamond
has
been
valued
ah
said
the
traveler
well
well
monsieur
the
jeweler
of
gives
two
hundred
and
eighty
pistoles
for
it
have
you
them
i
thought
it
best
to
take
them
monsieur
nevertheless
i
made
it
a
condition
of
the
bargain
that
if
monsieur
wished
to
keep
his
diamond
it
should
be
held
till
monsieur
was
again
in
funds
oh
no
not
at
all
i
told
you
to
sell
it
then
i
have
obeyed
or
nearly
so
since
without
having
definitely
sold
it
i
have
touched
the
money
pay
yourself
added
the
unknown
i
will
do
so
monsieur
since
you
so
positively
require
it
a
sad
smile
passed
over
the
lips
of
the
gentleman
place
the
money
on
that
trunk
said
he
turning
round
and
pointing
to
the
piece
of
furniture
cropole
deposited
a
tolerably
large
bag
as
directed
after
having
taken
from
it
the
amount
of
his
reckoning
now
said
he
i
hope
monsieur
will
not
give
me
the
pain
of
not
taking
any
supper
dinner
has
already
been
refused
this
is
affronting
to
the
house
of
les
medici
look
monsieur
the
supper
is
on
the
table
and
i
venture
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
bad
one
the
unknown
asked
for
a
glass
of
wine
broke
off
a
morsel
of
bread
and
did
not
stir
from
the
window
whilst
he
ate
and
drank
shortly
after
was
heard
a
loud
flourish
of
trumpets
cries
arose
in
the
distance
a
confused
buzzing
filled
the
lower
part
of
the
city
and
the
first
distinct
sound
that
struck
the
ears
of
the
stranger
was
the
tramp
of
advancing
horses
the
king
the
king
repeated
a
noisy
and
eager
crowd
the
king
cried
cropole
abandoning
his
guest
and
his
ideas
of
delicacy
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
with
cropole
were
mingled
and
jostled
on
the
staircase
madame
cropole
pittrino
and
the
waiters
and
scullions
the
cortege
advanced
slowly
lighted
by
a
thousand
flambeaux
in
the
streets
and
from
the
windows
after
a
company
of
musketeers
a
closely
ranked
troop
of
gentlemen
came
the
litter
of
monsieur
le
cardinal
drawn
like
a
carriage
by
four
black
horses
the
pages
and
people
of
the
cardinal
marched
behind
next
came
the
carriage
of
the
with
her
maids
of
honor
at
the
doors
her
gentlemen
on
horseback
at
both
sides
the
king
then
appeared
mounted
upon
a
splendid
horse
of
saxon
breed
with
a
flowing
mane
the
young
prince
exhibited
when
bowing
to
some
windows
from
which
issued
the
most
animated
acclamations
a
noble
and
handsome
countenance
illuminated
by
the
flambeaux
of
his
pages
by
the
side
of
the
king
though
a
little
in
the
rear
the
prince
de
conde
dangeau
and
twenty
other
courtiers
followed
by
their
people
and
their
baggage
closed
this
veritably
triumphant
march
the
pomp
was
of
a
military
character
some
of
the
courtiers
the
elder
ones
for
instance
wore
traveling
dresses
but
all
the
rest
were
clothed
in
warlike
panoply
many
wore
the
gorget
and
buff
coat
of
the
times
of
henry
iv
and
louis
xiii
when
the
king
passed
before
him
the
unknown
who
had
leant
forward
over
the
balcony
to
obtain
a
better
view
and
who
had
concealed
his
face
by
leaning
on
his
arm
felt
his
heart
swell
and
overflow
with
a
bitter
jealousy
the
noise
of
the
trumpets
excited
him
the
popular
acclamations
deafened
him
for
a
moment
he
allowed
his
reason
to
be
absorbed
in
this
flood
of
lights
tumult
and
brilliant
images
he
is
a
king
murmured
he
in
an
accent
of
despair
then
before
he
had
recovered
from
his
sombre
reverie
all
the
noise
all
the
splendor
had
passed
away
at
the
angle
of
the
street
there
remained
nothing
beneath
the
stranger
but
a
few
hoarse
discordant
voices
shouting
at
intervals
vive
le
roi
there
remained
likewise
the
six
candles
held
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
hostelry
des
medici
that
is
to
say
two
for
cropole
two
for
pittrino
and
one
for
each
scullion
cropole
never
ceased
repeating
how
the
king
is
how
strongly
he
resembles
his
illustrious
father
a
handsome
likeness
said
pittrino
and
what
a
lofty
carriage
he
has
added
madame
cropole
already
in
promiscuous
commentary
with
her
neighbors
of
both
sexes
cropole
was
feeding
their
gossip
with
his
own
personal
remarks
without
observing
that
an
old
man
on
foot
but
leading
a
small
irish
horse
by
the
bridle
was
endeavoring
to
penetrate
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
which
blocked
up
the
entrance
to
the
medici
but
at
that
moment
the
voice
of
the
stranger
was
heard
from
the
window
make
way
monsieur
l
hotelier
to
the
entrance
of
your
house
cropole
turned
around
and
on
seeing
the
old
man
cleared
a
passage
for
him
the
window
was
instantly
closed
pittrino
pointed
out
the
way
to
the
guest
who
entered
without
uttering
a
word
the
stranger
waited
for
him
on
the
landing
he
opened
his
arms
to
the
old
man
and
led
him
to
a
seat
oh
no
no
my
lord
said
he
sit
down
in
your
presence
never

cried
the
gentleman
i

age

i
have
my
reply
to
give
your
lordship
in
the
first
place

i
conjure
you
to
tell
me
nothing
for
if
your
news
had
been
good
you
would
not
have
begun
in
such
a
manner
you
go
about
which
proves
that
the
news
is
bad
my
lord
said
the
old
man
do
not
hasten
to
alarm
yourself
all
is
not
lost
i
hope
you
must
employ
energy
but
more
particularly
resignation
parry
said
the
young
man
i
have
reached
this
place
through
a
thousand
snares
and
after
a
thousand
difficulties
can
you
doubt
my
energy
i
have
meditated
this
journey
ten
years
in
spite
of
all
counsels
and
all
obstacles
have
you
faith
in
my
perseverance
i
have
this
evening
sold
the
last
of
my
father
s
diamonds
for
i
had
nothing
wherewith
to
pay
for
my
lodgings
and
my
host
was
about
to
turn
me
out
parry
made
a
gesture
of
indignation
to
which
the
young
man
replied
by
a
pressure
of
the
hand
and
a
smile
i
have
still
two
hundred
and
pistoles
left
and
i
feel
myself
rich
i
do
not
despair
parry
have
you
faith
in
my
resignation
the
old
man
raised
his
trembling
hands
towards
heaven
let
me
know
said
the
stranger
disguise
nothing
from
me
what
has
happened
my
recital
will
be
short
my
lord
but
in
the
name
of
heaven
do
not
tremble
so
it
is
impatience
parry
come
what
did
the
general
say
to
you
at
first
the
general
would
not
receive
me
he
took
you
for
a
spy
yes
my
lord
but
i
wrote
him
a
letter
well
he
read
it
and
received
me
my
lord
did
that
letter
thoroughly
explain
my
position
and
my
views
oh
yes
said
parry
with
a
sad
smile
it
painted
your
very
thoughts
faithfully
well
then
parry
then
the
general
sent
me
back
the
letter
by
an
informing
me
that
if
i
were
found
the
next
day
within
the
circumscription
of
his
command
he
would
have
me
arrested
arrested
murmured
the
young
man
what
arrest
you
my
most
faithful
servant
yes
my
lord
and
notwithstanding
you
had
signed
the
name
parry
to
all
my
letters
my
lord
and
the
had
known
me
at
james
s
and
at
whitehall
too
added
the
old
man
with
a
sigh
the
young
man
leaned
forward
thoughtful
and
sad
ay
that
s
what
he
did
before
his
people
said
he
endeavoring
to
cheat
himself
with
hopes
but
privately
between
you
and
him
what
did
he
do
answer
alas
my
lord
he
sent
to
me
four
cavaliers
who
gave
me
the
horse
with
which
you
just
now
saw
me
come
back
these
cavaliers
conducted
me
in
great
haste
to
the
little
port
of
tenby
threw
me
rather
than
embarked
me
into
a
little
about
to
sail
for
brittany
and
here
i
am
oh
sighed
the
young
man
clasping
his
neck
convulsively
with
his
hand
and
with
a
sob
parry
is
that
all
is
that
all
yes
my
lord
that
is
all
after
this
brief
reply
ensued
a
long
interval
of
silence
broken
only
by
the
convulsive
beating
of
the
heel
of
the
young
man
on
the
floor
the
old
man
endeavored
to
change
the
conversation
it
was
leading
to
thoughts
much
too
sinister
my
lord
said
he
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
the
noise
which
preceded
me
what
are
these
people
crying
vive
le
roi
for
what
king
do
they
mean
and
what
are
all
these
lights
for
ah
parry
replied
the
young
man
ironically
don
t
you
know
that
this
is
the
king
of
france
visiting
his
good
city
of
blois
all
these
trumpets
are
his
all
those
gilded
housings
are
his
all
those
gentlemen
wear
swords
that
are
his
his
mother
precedes
him
in
a
carriage
magnificently
encrusted
with
silver
and
gold
happy
mother
his
minister
heaps
up
millions
and
conducts
him
to
a
rich
bride
then
all
these
people
rejoice
they
love
their
king
they
hail
him
with
their
acclamations
and
they
cry
vive
le
roi
vive
le
roi
well
well
my
lord
said
parry
more
uneasy
at
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
than
at
the
other
you
know
resumed
the
unknown
that
my
mother
and
my
sister
whilst
all
this
is
going
on
in
honor
of
the
king
of
france
have
neither
money
nor
bread
you
know
that
i
myself
shall
be
poor
and
degraded
within
a
fortnight
when
all
europe
will
become
acquainted
with
what
you
have
told
me
parry
are
there
not
examples
in
which
a
man
of
my
condition
should
himself
my
lord
in
the
name
of
heaven
you
are
right
parry
i
am
a
coward
and
if
i
do
nothing
for
myself
what
will
god
do
no
no
i
have
two
arms
parry
and
i
have
a
sword
and
he
struck
his
arm
violently
with
his
hand
and
took
down
his
sword
which
hung
against
the
wall
what
are
you
going
to
do
my
lord
what
am
i
going
to
do
parry
what
every
one
in
my
family
does
my
mother
lives
on
public
charity
my
sister
begs
for
my
mother
i
have
somewhere
or
other
brothers
who
equally
beg
for
themselves
and
i
the
eldest
will
go
and
do
as
all
the
rest
do
i
will
go
and
ask
charity
and
with
these
words
which
he
finished
sharply
with
a
nervous
and
terrible
laugh
the
young
man
girded
on
his
sword
took
his
hat
from
the
trunk
fastened
to
his
shoulder
a
black
cloak
which
he
had
worn
all
during
his
journey
and
pressing
the
two
hands
of
the
old
man
who
watched
his
proceedings
with
a
look
of
anxiety
my
good
parry
said
he
order
a
fire
drink
eat
sleep
and
be
happy
let
us
both
be
happy
my
faithful
friend
my
only
friend
we
are
rich
as
rich
as
kings
he
struck
the
bag
of
pistoles
with
his
clenched
hand
as
he
spoke
and
it
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
he
resumed
that
dismal
laugh
that
had
so
alarmed
parry
and
whilst
the
whole
household
was
screaming
singing
and
preparing
to
install
the
travelers
who
had
been
preceded
by
their
lackeys
he
glided
out
by
the
principal
entrance
into
the
street
where
the
old
man
who
had
gone
to
the
window
lost
sight
of
him
in
a
moment
chapter
viii
what
his
majesty
king
louis
xiv
was
at
the
age
of
it
has
been
seen
by
the
account
we
have
endeavored
to
give
of
it
that
the
entree
of
king
louis
xiv
into
the
city
of
blois
had
been
noisy
and
brilliant
his
young
majesty
had
therefore
appeared
perfectly
satisfied
with
it
on
arriving
beneath
the
porch
of
the
castle
of
the
states
the
king
met
surrounded
by
his
guards
and
gentlemen
with
the
duke
gaston
of
orleans
whose
physiognomy
naturally
rather
majestic
had
borrowed
on
this
solemn
occasion
a
fresh
luster
and
a
fresh
dignity

her
part
madame
dressed
in

robes

awaited
in

the
entrance
of
her
nephew

the
windows
of
the
old
castle
so
deserted
and
dismal
on
ordinary
days
were
resplendent
with
ladies
and
lights
it
was
then
to
the
sound
of
drums
trumpets
and
vivats
that
the
young
king
crossed
the
threshold
of
that
castle
in
which
years
before
henry
iii
had
called
in
the
aid
of
assassination
and
treachery
to
keep
upon
his
head
and
in
his
house
a
crown
which
was
already
slipping
from
his
brow
to
fall
into
another
family
all
eyes
after
having
admired
the
young
king
so
handsome
and
so
agreeable

for
that
other

much
otherwise

people
called

louis

at
this
time
endowed
with
all
the
natural
gifts

of
the
king
the
most
skillful
physiognomists
we
say
would
never
have
been
able
to
fathom
the
depths
of
that
abyss
of
mildness
it
was
with
the
eyes
of
the
king
as
with
the
immense
depths
of
the
azure
heavens
or
with
those
more
terrific
and
almost
as
sublime
which
the
mediterranean
reveals
under
the
keels
of
its
ships
in
a
clear
summer
day
a
gigantic
mirror
in
which
heaven
delights
to
reflect
sometimes
its
stars
sometimes
its
storms
the
king
was
short
of
stature
he
was
scarcely
five
feet
two
inches
but
his
youth
made
up
for
this
defect
set
off
likewise
by
great
nobleness
in
all
his
movements
and
by
considerable
address
in
all
bodily
exercises
certes
he
was
already
quite
a
king
and
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
a
king
in
that
period
of
traditional
devotedness
and
respect
but
as
up
to
that
time
he
had
been
but
seldom
and
always
poorly
shown
to
the
people
as
they
to
whom
he
was
shown
saw
him
by
the
side
of
his
mother
a
tall
woman
and
monsieur
le
cardinal
a
man
of
commanding
presence
many
found
him
so
little
of
a
king
as
to
say
why
the
king
is
not
so
tall
as
monsieur
le
cardinal
whatever
may
be
thought
of
these
physical
observations
which
were
principally
made
in
the
capital
the
young
king
was
welcomed
as
a
god
by
the
inhabitants
of
blois
and
almost
like
a
king
by
his
uncle
and
aunt
monsieur
and
madame
the
inhabitants
of
the
castle
it
must
however
be
allowed
that
when
he
saw
in
the
hall
of
reception
chairs
of
equal
height
for
himself
his
mother
the
cardinal
and
his
uncle
and
aunt
a
disposition
artfully
concealed
by
the
form
of
the
assembly
louis
xiv
became
red
with
anger
and
looked
around
him
to
ascertain
by
the
countenances
of
those
that
were
present
if
this
humiliation
had
been
prepared
for
him
but
as
he
saw
nothing
upon
the
impassible
visage
of
the
cardinal
nothing
on
that
of
his
mother
nothing
on
those
of
the
assembly
he
resigned
himself
and
sat
down
taking
care
to
be
seated
before
anybody
else
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
were
presented
to
their
majesties
and
monsieur
le
cardinal
the
king
remarked
that
his
mother
and
he
scarcely
knew
the
names
of
any
of
the
persons
who
were
presented
to
them
whilst
the
cardinal
on
the
contrary
never
failed
with
an
admirable
memory
and
presence
of
mind
to
talk
to
every
one
about
his
estates
his
ancestors
or
his
children
some
of
whom
he
named
which
enchanted
those
worthy
country
gentlemen
and
confirmed
them
in
the
idea
that
he
alone
is
truly
king
who
knows
his
subjects
from
the
same
reason
that
the
sun
has
no
rival
because
the
sun
alone
warms
and
lightens
the
study
of
the
young
king
which
had
begun
a
long
time
before
without
anybody
suspecting
it
was
continued
then
and
he
looked
around
him
attentively
to
endeavor
to
make
out
something
in
the
physiognomies
which
had
at
first
appeared
the
most
insignificant
and
trivial
a
collation
was
served
the
king
without
daring
to
call
upon
the
hospitality
of
his
uncle
had
waited
for
it
impatiently
this
time
therefore
he
had
all
the
honors
due
if
not
to
his
rank
at
least
to
his
appetite
as
to
the
cardinal
he
contented
himself
with
touching
with
his
withered
lips
a
bouillon
served
in
a
golden
cup
the
minister
who
had
taken
her
regency
from
the
queen
and
his
royalty
from
the
king
had
not
been
able
to
take
a
good
stomach
from
nature
anne
of
austria
already
suffering
from
the
cancer
which
six
or
eight
years
after
caused
her
death
ate
very
little
more
than
the
cardinal
for
monsieur
already
puffed
up
with
the
great
event
which
had
taken
place
in
his
provincial
life
he
ate
nothing
whatever
madame
alone
like
a
true
lorrainer
kept
pace
with
his
majesty
so
that
louis
who
without
this
partner
might
have
eaten
nearly
alone
was
at
first
much
pleased
with
his
aunt
and
afterwards
with
de
her
maitre
d
hotel
who
had
really
distinguished
himself
the
collation
over
at
a
sign
of
approbation
from
de
mazarin
the
king
arose
and
at
the
invitation
of
his
aunt
walked
about
among
the
ranks
of
the
assembly
the
ladies
then
observed
there
are
certain
things
for
which
women
are
as
good
observers
at
blois
as
at
paris
the
ladies
then
observed
that
louis
xiv
had
a
prompt
and
bold
look
which
premised
a
distinguished
appreciator
of
beauty
the
men
on
their
part
observed
that
the
prince
was
proud
and
haughty
that
he
loved
to
look
down
those
who
fixed
their
eyes
upon
him
too
long
or
too
earnestly
which
gave
presage
of
a
master
louis
xiv
had
accomplished
about
a
third
of
his
review
when
his
ears
were
struck
with
a
word
which
his
eminence
pronounced
whilst
conversing
with
monsieur
this
word
was
the
name
of
a
woman
scarcely
had
louis
xiv
heard
this
word
than
he
heard
or
rather
listening
to
nothing
else
and
neglecting
the
arc
of
the
circle
which
awaited
his
visit
his
object
seemed
to
be
to
come
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
extremity
of
the
curve
monsieur
like
a
good
courtier
was
inquiring
of
monsieur
le
cardinal
after
the
health
of
his
nieces
he
regretted
he
said
not
having
the
pleasure
of
receiving
them
at
the
same
time
with
their
uncle
they
must
certainly
have
grown
in
stature
beauty
and
grace
as
they
had
promised
to
do
the
last
time
monsieur
had
seen
them
what
had
first
struck
the
king
was
a
certain
constraint
in
the
voices
of
the
two
interlocutors
the
voice
of
monsieur
was
calm
and
natural
when
he
spoke
thus
while
that
of
de
mazarin
jumped
by
a
note
and
a
half
to
reply
above
the
diapason
of
his
usual
voice
it
might
have
been
said
that
he
wished
that
voice
to
strike
at
the
end
of
the
salon
any
ear
that
was
too
distant
monseigneur
replied
he
mesdemoiselles
de
mazarin
have
still
to
finish
their
education
they
have
duties
to
fulfill
and
a
position
to
make
an
abode
in
a
young
and
brilliant
court
would
dissipate
them
a
little
louis
at
this
last
sentence
smiled
sadly
the
court
was
young
it
was
true
but
the
avarice
of
the
cardinal
had
taken
good
care
that
it
should
not
be
brilliant
you
have
nevertheless
no
intention
replied
monsieur
to
cloister
them
or
make
them
borgeoises
not
at
all
replied
the
cardinal
forcing
his
italian
pronunciation
in
such
a
manner
that
from
soft
and
velvety
as
it
was
it
became
sharp
and
vibrating
not
at
all
i
have
a
full
and
fixed
intention
to
marry
them
and
that
as
well
as
i
shall
be
able
parties
will
not
be
wanting
monsieur
le
cardinal
replied
monsieur
with
a
bonhomie
worthy
of
one
tradesman
congratulating
another
i
hope
not
monseigneur
and
with
reason
as
god
has
been
pleased
to
give
them
grace
intelligence
and
beauty
during
this
conversation
louis
conducted
by
madame
accomplished
as
we
have
described
the
circle
of
presentations
mademoiselle
auricule
said
the
princess
presenting
to
his
majesty
a
fat
fair
girl
of
who
at
a
village
fete
might
have
been
taken
for
a
peasant
in
sunday
finery
the
daughter
of
my
the
king
smiled
madame
had
never
been
able
to
extract
four
correct
notes
from
either
viol
or
harpsichord
mademoiselle
aure
de
montalais
continued
madame
a
young
lady
of
rank
and
my
good
attendant
this
time
it
was
not
the
king
that
smiled
it
was
the
young
lady
presented
because
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
heard
given
to
her
by
madame
who
generally
showed
no
tendency
to
spoil
her
such
an
honorable
qualification
our
old
acquaintance
montalais
therefore
made
his
majesty
a
profound
courtesy
the
more
respectful
from
the
necessity
she
was
under
of
concealing
certain
contractions
of
her
laughing
lips
which
the
king
might
not
have
attributed
to
their
real
cause
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
the
king
caught
the
word
which
startled
him
and
the
name
of
the
third
asked
monsieur
mary
monseigneur
replied
the
cardinal
there
was
doubtless
some
magical
influence
in
that
word
for
as
we
have
said
the
king
started
in
hearing
it
and
drew
madame
towards
the
middle
of
the
circle
as
if
he
wished
to
put
some
confidential
question
to
her
but
in
reality
for
the
sake
of
getting
nearer
to
the
cardinal
madame
my
aunt
said
he
laughing
and
in
a
suppressed
voice
my
did
not
teach
me
that
blois
was
at
such
an
immense
distance
from
paris
what
do
you
mean
nephew
asked
madame
why
because
it
would
appear
that
it
requires
several
years
as
regards
fashion
to
travel
the
distance
look
at
those
young
ladies
well
i
know
them
all
some
of
them
are
pretty
don
t
say
that
too
loud
monsieur
my
nephew
you
will
drive
them
wild
stop
a
bit
stop
a
bit
dear
aunt
said
the
king
smiling
for
the
second
part
of
my
sentence
will
serve
as
a
corrective
to
the
first
well
my
dear
aunt
some
of
them
appear
old
and
others
ugly
thanks
to
their
fashions
but
sire
blois
is
only
five
days
journey
from
paris
yes
that
is
it
said
the
king
two
years
behind
for
each
day
indeed
do
you
really
think
so
well
that
is
strange
it
never
struck
me
now
look
aunt
said
louis
drawing
still
nearer
to
mazarin
under
the
pretext
of
gaining
a
better
point
of
view
look
at
that
simple
white
dress
by
the
side
of
those
antiquated
specimens
of
finery
and
those
pretentious
coiffures
she
is
probably
one
of
my
mother
s
maids
of
honor
though
i
don
t
know
her
ah
ah
my
dear
nephew
replied
madame
laughing
permit
me
to
tell
you
that
your
divinatory
science
is
at
fault
for
once
the
young
lady
you
honor
with
your
praise
is
not
a
parisian
but
a
blaisoise
oh
aunt
replied
the
king
with
a
look
of
doubt
come
here
louise
said
madame
and
the
fair
girl
already
known
to
you
under
that
name
approached
them
timid
blushing
and
almost
bent
beneath
the
royal
glance
mademoiselle
louise
francoise
de
la
beaume
le
blanc
the
daughter
of
the
marquise
de
la
valliere
said
madame
ceremoniously
the
young
girl
bowed
with
so
much
grace
mingled
with
the
profound
timidity
inspired
by
the
presence
of
the
king
that
the
latter
lost
while
looking
at
her
a
few
words
of
the
conversation
of
monsieur
and
the
cardinal
continued
madame
of
de
my
maitre
d
hotel
who
presided
over
the
confection
of
that
excellent
daube
truffee
which
your
majesty
seemed
so
much
to
appreciate
no
grace
no
youth
no
beauty
could
stand
out
against
such
a
presentation
the
king
smiled
whether
the
words
of
madame
were
a
pleasantry
or
uttered
in
all
innocency
they
proved
the
pitiless
immolation
of
everything
that
louis
had
found
charming
or
poetic
in
the
young
girl
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
for
madame
and
by
rebound
for
the
king
was
for
a
moment
no
more
than
the
daughter
of
a
man
of
a
superior
talent
over
dindes
truffees
but
princes
are
thus
constituted
the
gods
too
were
just
like
this
in
olympus
diana
and
venus
no
doubt
abused
the
beautiful
alcmena
and
poor
io
when
they
condescended
for
distraction
s
sake
to
speak
amidst
nectar
and
ambrosia
of
mortal
beauties
at
the
table
of
jupiter
fortunately
louise
was
so
bent
in
her
reverential
salute
that
she
did
not
catch
either
madame
s
words
or
the
king
s
smile
in
fact
if
the
poor
child
who
had
so
much
good
taste
as
alone
to
have
chosen
to
dress
herself
in
white
amidst
all
her
companions
if
that
dove
s
heart
so
easily
accessible
to
painful
emotions
had
been
touched
by
the
cruel
words
of
madame
or
the
egotistical
cold
smile
of
the
king
it
would
have
annihilated
her
and
montalais
herself
the
girl
of
ingenious
ideas
would
not
have
attempted
to
recall
her
to
life
for
ridicule
kills
beauty
even
but
fortunately
as
we
have
said
louise
whose
ears
were
buzzing
and
her
eyes
veiled
by
timidity
louise
saw
nothing
and
heard
nothing
and
the
king
who
had
still
his
attention
directed
to
the
conversation
of
the
cardinal
and
his
uncle
hastened
to
return
to
them
he
came
up
just
at
the
moment
mazarin
terminated
by
saying
mary
as
well
as
her
sisters
has
just
set
off
for
brouage
i
make
them
follow
the
opposite
bank
of
the
loire
to
that
along
which
we
have
traveled
and
if
i
calculate
their
progress
correctly
according
to
the
orders
i
have
given
they
will
be
opposite
blois
these
words
were
pronounced
with
that
tact
that
measure
that
distinctness
of
tone
of
intention
and
reach
which
made
del
signor
giulio
mazarini
the
first
comedian
in
the
world
it
resulted
that
they
went
straight
to
the
heart
of
louis
and
the
cardinal
on
turning
round
at
the
simple
noise
of
the
approaching
footsteps
of
his
majesty
saw
the
immediate
effect
of
them
upon
the
countenance
of
his
pupil
an
effect
betrayed
to
the
keen
eyes
of
his
eminence
by
a
slight
increase
of
color
but
what
was
the
ventilation
of
such
a
secret
to
him
whose
craft
had
for
twenty
years
deceived
all
the
diplomatists
of
europe
from
the
moment
the
young
king
heard
these
last
words
he
appeared
as
if
he
had
received
a
poisoned
arrow
in
his
heart
he
could
not
remain
quiet
in
a
place
but
cast
around
an
uncertain
dead
and
aimless
look
over
the
assembly
he
with
his
eyes
interrogated
his
mother
more
than
twenty
times
but
she
given
up
to
the
pleasure
of
conversing
with
her
and
likewise
constrained
by
the
glance
of
mazarin
did
not
appear
to
comprehend
any
of
the
supplications
conveyed
by
the
looks
of
her
son
from
this
moment
music
lights
flowers
beauties
all
became
odious
and
insipid
to
louis
xiv
after
he
had
a
hundred
times
bitten
his
lips
stretched
his
legs
and
his
arms
like
a
child
who
without
daring
to
gape
exhausts
all
the
modes
of
evincing
his
weariness
after
having
uselessly
again
implored
his
mother
and
the
minister
he
turned
a
despairing
look
towards
the
door
that
is
to
say
towards
liberty
at
this
door
in
the
embrasure
of
which
he
was
leaning
he
saw
standing
out
strongly
a
figure
with
a
brown
and
lofty
countenance
an
aquiline
nose
a
stern
but
brilliant
eye
gray
and
long
hair
a
black
mustache
the
true
type
of
military
beauty
whose
gorget
more
sparkling
than
a
mirror
broke
all
the
reflected
lights
which
concentrated
upon
it
and
sent
them
back
as
lightning
this
officer
wore
his
gray
hat
with
its
long
red
plumes
upon
his
head
a
proof
that
he
was
called
there
by
his
duty
and
not
by
his
pleasure
if
he
had
been
brought
thither
by
his
pleasure
if
he
had
been
a
courtier
instead
of
a
soldier
as
pleasure
must
always
be
paid
for
at
the
same
price
he
would
have
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
that
which
proved
still
better
that
this
officer
was
upon
duty
and
was
accomplishing
a
task
to
which
he
was
accustomed
was
that
he
watched
with
folded
arms
remarkable
indifference
and
supreme
apathy
the
joys
and
ennuis
of
this
fete
above
all
he
appeared
like
a
philosopher
and
all
old
soldiers
are
philosophers
he
appeared
above
all
to
comprehend
the
ennuis
infinitely
better
than
the
joys
but
in
the
one
he
took
his
part
knowing
very
well
how
to
do
without
the
other
now
he
was
leaning
as
we
have
said
against
the
carved
when
the
melancholy
weary
eyes
of
the
king
by
chance
met
his
it
was
not
the
first
time
as
it
appeared
that
the
eyes
of
the
officer
had
met
those
eyes
and
he
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
expression
of
them
for
as
soon
as
he
had
cast
his
own
look
upon
the
countenance
of
louis
and
had
read
by
it
what
was
passing
in
his
heart
that
is
to
say
all
the
ennui
that
oppressed
him
all
the
timid
desire
to
go
out
which
agitated
him
he
perceived
he
must
render
the
king
a
service
without
his
commanding
it
almost
in
spite
of
himself
boldly
therefore
as
if
he
had
given
the
word
of
command
to
cavalry
in
battle
on
the
king
s
service
cried
he
in
a
clear
sonorous
voice
at
these
words
which
produced
the
effect
of
a
peal
of
thunder
prevailing
over
the
orchestra
the
singing
and
the
buzz
of
the
promenaders
the
cardinal
and
the
looked
at
each
other
with
surprise
louis
pale
but
resolved
supported
as
he
was
by
that
intuition
of
his
own
thought
which
he
had
found
in
the
mind
of
the
officer
of
musketeers
and
which
he
had
just
manifested
by
the
order
given
arose
from
his
chair
and
took
a
step
towards
the
door
are
you
going
my
son
said
the
queen
whilst
mazarin
satisfied
himself
with
interrogating
by
a
look
which
might
have
appeared
mild
if
it
had
not
been
so
piercing
yes
madame
replied
the
king
i
am
fatigued
and
besides
wish
to
write
this
evening
a
smile
stole
over
the
lips
of
the
minister
who
appeared
by
a
bend
of
the
head
to
give
the
king
permission
monsieur
and
madame
hastened
to
give
orders
to
the
officers
who
presented
themselves
the
king
bowed
crossed
the
hall
and
gained
the
door
where
a
hedge
of
twenty
musketeers
awaited
him
at
the
extremity
of
this
hedge
stood
the
officer
impassible
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
the
king
passed
and
all
the
crowd
stood
on
to
have
one
more
look
at
him
ten
musketeers
opening
the
crowd
of
the
and
the
steps
made
way
for
his
majesty
the
other
ten
surrounded
the
king
and
monsieur
who
had
insisted
upon
accompanying
his
majesty
the
domestics
walked
behind
this
little
cortege
escorted
the
king
to
the
chamber
destined
for
him
the
apartment
was
the
same
that
had
been
occupied
by
henry
iii
during
his
sojourn
in
the
states
monsieur
had
given
his
orders
the
musketeers
led
by
their
officer
took
possession
of
the
little
passage
by
which
one
wing
of
the
castle
communicates
with
the
other
this
passage
was
commenced
by
a
small
square
dark
even
in
the
finest
days
monsieur
stopped
louis
xiv
you
are
passing
now
sire
said
he
the
very
spot
where
the
duc
de
guise
received
the
first
stab
of
the
poniard
the
king
was
ignorant
of
all
historical
matters
he
had
heard
of
the
fact
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
localities
or
the
details
ah
said
he
with
a
shudder
and
he
stopped
the
rest
both
behind
and
before
him
stopped
likewise
the
duc
sire
continued
gaston
was
nearly
were
i
stand
he
was
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
your
majesty
de
loignac
was
exactly
where
your
lieutenant
of
musketeers
is
de
and
his
majesty
s
ordinaries
were
behind
him
and
around
him
it
was
here
that
he
was
struck
the
king
turned
towards
his
officer
and
saw
something
like
a
cloud
pass
over
his
martial
and
daring
countenance
yes
from
behind
murmured
the
lieutenant
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
disdain
and
he
endeavored
to
resume
the
march
as
if
ill
at
ease
at
being
between
walls
formerly
defiled
by
treachery
but
the
king
who
appeared
to
wish
to
be
informed
was
disposed
to
give
another
look
at
this
dismal
spot
gaston
perceived
his
nephew
s
desire
look
sire
said
he
taking
a
flambeaux
from
the
hands
of
de
this
is
where
he
fell
there
was
a
bed
there
the
curtains
of
which
he
tore
with
catching
at
them
why
does
the
floor
seem
hollowed
out
at
this
spot
asked
louis
because
it
was
here
the
blood
flowed
replied
gaston
the
blood
penetrated
deeply
into
the
oak
and
it
was
only
by
cutting
it
out
that
they
succeeded
in
making
it
disappear
and
even
then
added
gaston
pointing
the
flambeaux
to
the
spot
even
then
this
red
stain
resisted
all
the
attempts
made
to
destroy
it
louis
xiv
raised
his
head
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
that
bloody
trace
that
had
once
been
shown
him
at
the
louvre
and
which
as
a
pendant
to
that
of
blois
had
been
made
there
one
day
by
the
king
his
father
with
the
blood
of
concini
let
us
go
on
said
he
the
march
was
resumed
promptly
for
emotion
no
doubt
had
given
to
the
voice
of
the
young
prince
a
tone
of
command
which
was
not
customary
with
him
when
he
arrived
at
the
apartment
destined
for
the
king
which
communicated
not
only
with
the
little
passage
we
have
passed
through
but
further
with
the
great
staircase
leading
to
the
court
will
your
majesty
said
gaston
condescend
to
occupy
this
apartment
all
unworthy
as
it
is
to
receive
you
uncle
replied
the
young
king
i
render
you
my
thanks
for
your
cordial
hospitality
gaston
bowed
to
his
nephew
embraced
him
and
then
went
out
of
the
twenty
musketeers
who
had
accompanied
the
king
ten
reconducted
monsieur
to
the
which
were
not
yet
empty
notwithstanding
the
king
had
retired
the
ten
others
were
posted
by
their
officer
who
himself
explored
in
five
minutes
all
the
localities
with
that
cold
and
certain
glance
which
not
even
habit
gives
unless
that
glance
belongs
to
genius
then
when
all
were
placed
he
chose
as
his
headquarters
the
in
which
he
found
a
large
fauteuil
a
lamp
some
wine
some
water
and
some
dry
bread
he
refreshed
his
lamp
drank
half
a
glass
of
wine
curled
his
lip
with
a
smile
full
of
expression
installed
himself
in
his
large
armchair
and
made
preparations
for
sleeping
chapter
ix
in
which
the
unknown
of
the
hostelry
of
les
medici
loses
his
incognito
this
officer
who
was
sleeping
or
preparing
to
sleep
was
notwithstanding
his
careless
air
charged
with
a
serious
responsibility
lieutenant
of
the
king
s
musketeers
he
commanded
all
the
company
which
came
from
paris
and
that
company
consisted
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
but
with
the
exception
of
the
twenty
of
whom
we
have
spoken
the
other
hundred
were
engaged
in
guarding
the
and
more
particularly
the
cardinal
monsignor
giulio
mazarini
economized
the
traveling
expenses
of
his
guards
he
consequently
used
the
king
s
and
that
largely
since
he
took
fifty
of
them
for
himself
a
peculiarity
which
would
not
have
failed
to
strike
any
one
unacquainted
with
the
usages
of
that
court
that
which
would
still
further
have
appeared
if
not
inconvenient
at
least
extraordinary
to
a
stranger
was
that
the
side
of
the
castle
destined
for
monsieur
le
cardinal
was
brilliant
light
and
cheerful
the
musketeers
there
mounted
guard
before
every
door
and
allowed
no
one
to
enter
except
the
couriers
who
even
while
he
was
traveling
followed
the
cardinal
for
the
carrying
on
of
his
correspondence
twenty
men
were
on
duty
with
the
thirty
rested
in
order
to
relieve
their
companions
the
next
day
on
the
king
s
side
on
the
contrary
were
darkness
silence
and
solitude
when
once
the
doors
were
closed
there
was
no
longer
an
appearance
of
royalty
all
the
servitors
had
by
degrees
retired
monsieur
le
prince
had
sent
to
know
if
his
majesty
required
his
attendance
and
on
the
customary
no
of
the
lieutenant
of
musketeers
who
was
habituated
to
the
question
and
the
reply
all
appeared
to
sink
into
the
arms
of
sleep
as
if
in
the
dwelling
of
a
good
citizen
and
yet
it
was
possible
to
hear
from
the
side
of
the
house
occupied
by
the
young
king
the
music
of
the
banquet
and
to
see
the
windows
of
the
great
hall
richly
illuminated
ten
minutes
after
his
installation
in
his
apartment
louis
xiv
had
been
able
to
learn
by
movement
much
more
distinguished
than
marked
his
own
leaving
the
departure
of
the
cardinal
who
in
his
turn
sought
his
bedroom
accompanied
by
a
large
escort
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
besides
to
perceive
this
movement
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
look
out
at
his
window
the
shutters
of
which
had
not
been
closed
his
eminence
crossed
the
court
conducted
by
monsieur
who
himself
held
a
flambeau
then
followed
the
to
whom
madame
familiarly
gave
her
arm
and
both
walked
chatting
away
like
two
old
friends
behind
these
two
couples
filed
nobles
ladies
pages
and
officers
the
flambeaux
gleamed
over
the
whole
court
like
the
moving
reflections
of
a
conflagration
then
the
noise
of
steps
and
voices
became
lost
in
the
upper
floors
of
the
castle
no
one
was
then
thinking
of
the
king
who
leaning
on
his
elbow
at
his
window
had
sadly
seen
pass
away
all
that
light
and
heard
that
noise
die
off
no
not
one
if
it
was
not
that
unknown
of
the
hostelry
des
medici
whom
we
have
seen
go
out
enveloped
in
his
cloak
he
had
come
straight
up
to
the
castle
and
had
with
his
melancholy
countenance
wandered
round
and
round
the
palace
from
which
the
people
had
not
yet
departed
and
finding
that
on
one
guarded
the
great
entrance
or
the
porch
seeing
that
the
soldiers
of
monsieur
were
fraternizing
with
the
royal
soldiers
that
is
to
say
swallowing
beaugency
at
discretion
or
rather
indiscretion
the
unknown
penetrated
through
the
crowd
then
ascended
to
the
court
and
came
to
the
landing
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
cardinal
s
apartment
what
according
to
all
probability
induced
him
to
direct
his
steps
that
way
was
the
splendor
of
the
flambeaux
and
the
busy
air
of
the
pages
and
domestics
but
he
was
stopped
short
by
a
presented
musket
and
the
cry
of
the
sentinel
where
are
you
going
my
friend
asked
the
soldier
i
am
going
to
the
king
s
apartment
replied
the
unknown
haughtily
but
tranquilly
the
soldier
called
one
of
his
eminence
s
officers
who
in
the
tone
in
which
a
youth
in
office
directs
a
solicitor
to
a
minister
let
fall
these
words
the
other
staircase
in
front
and
the
officer
without
further
notice
of
the
unknown
resumed
his
interrupted
conversation
the
stranger
without
reply
directed
his
steps
towards
the
staircase
pointed
out
to
him
on
this
side
there
was
no
noise
there
were
no
more
flambeaux
obscurity
through
which
a
sentinel
glided
like
a
shadow
silence
which
permitted
him
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
accompanied
with
the
jingling
of
his
spurs
upon
the
stone
slabs
this
guard
was
one
of
the
twenty
musketeers
appointed
for
attendance
upon
the
king
and
who
mounted
guard
with
the
stiffness
and
consciousness
of
a
statue
who
goes
there
said
the
guard
a
friend
replied
the
unknown
what
do
you
want
to
speak
to
the
king
do
you
my
dear
monsieur
that
s
not
very
likely
why
not
because
the
king
has
gone
to
bed
gone
to
bed
already
yes
no
matter
i
must
speak
to
him
and
i
tell
you
that
is
impossible
and
yet
go
back
do
you
require
the
word
i
have
no
account
to
render
to
you
stand
back
and
this
time
the
soldier
accompanied
his
word
with
a
threatening
gesture
but
the
unknown
stirred
no
more
than
if
his
feet
had
taken
root
monsieur
le
mousquetaire
said
he
are
you
a
gentleman
i
have
that
honor
very
well
i
also
am
one
and
between
gentlemen
some
consideration
ought
to
be
observed
the
soldier
lowered
his
arms
overcome
by
the
dignity
with
which
these
words
were
pronounced
speak
monsieur
said
he
and
if
you
ask
me
anything
in
my
power
thank
you
you
have
an
officer
have
you
not
our
lieutenant
yes
monsieur
well
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
oh
that
s
a
different
thing
come
up
monsieur
the
unknown
saluted
the
soldier
in
a
lofty
fashion
and
ascended
the
staircase
whilst
a
cry
lieutenant
a
visit
transmitted
from
sentinel
to
sentinel
preceded
the
unknown
and
disturbed
the
slumbers
of
the
officer
dragging
on
his
boot
rubbing
his
eyes
and
hooking
his
cloak
the
lieutenant
made
three
steps
towards
the
stranger
what
can
i
do
to
serve
you
monsieur
asked
he
you
are
the
officer
on
duty
lieutenant
of
the
musketeers
are
you
i
have
that
honor
replied
the
officer
monsieur
i
must
absolutely
speak
to
the
king
the
lieutenant
looked
attentively
at
the
unknown
and
in
that
look
he
saw
all
he
wished
to
see
that
is
to
say
a
person
of
high
distinction
in
an
ordinary
dress
i
do
not
suppose
you
to
be
mad
replied
he
and
yet
you
seem
to
me
to
be
in
a
condition
to
know
monsieur
that
people
do
not
enter
a
king
s
apartments
in
this
manner
without
his
consent
he
will
consent
monsieur
permit
me
to
doubt
that
the
king
has
retired
this
quarter
of
an
hour
he
must
be
now
undressing
besides
the
word
is
given
when
he
knows
who
i
am
he
will
recall
the
word
the
officer
was
more
and
more
surprised
more
and
more
subdued
if
i
consent
to
announce
you
may
i
at
least
know
whom
to
announce
monsieur
you
will
announce
his
majesty
charles
king
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
the
officer
uttered
a
cry
of
astonishment
drew
back
and
there
might
be
seen
upon
his
pallid
countenance
one
of
the
most
poignant
emotions
that
ever
an
energetic
man
endeavored
to
drive
back
to
his
heart
oh
yes
sire
in
fact
said
he
i
ought
to
have
recognized
you
you
have
seen
my
portrait
then
no
sire
or
else
you
have
seen
me
formerly
at
court
before
i
was
driven
from
france
no
sire
it
is
not
even
that
how
then
could
you
have
recognized
me
if
you
have
never
seen
my
portrait
or
my
person
sire
i
saw
his
majesty
your
father
at
a
terrible
moment
the
day
yes
a
dark
cloud
passed
over
the
brow
of
the
prince
then
dashing
his
hand
across
it
do
you
see
any
difficulty
in
announcing
me
said
he
sire
pardon
me
replied
the
officer
but
i
could
not
imagine
a
king
under
so
simple
an
exterior
and
yet
i
had
the
honor
to
tell
your
majesty
just
now
that
i
had
seen
charles
i
but
pardon
me
monsieur
i
will
go
and
inform
the
king
but
returning
after
going
a
few
steps
your
majesty
is
desirous
without
doubt
that
this
interview
should
be
a
secret
said
he
i
do
not
require
it
but
if
it
were
possible
to
preserve
it
it
is
possible
sire
for
i
can
dispense
with
informing
the
first
gentleman
on
duty
but
for
that
your
majesty
must
please
to
consent
to
give
up
your
sword
true
true
i
had
forgotten
that
no
one
armed
is
permitted
to
enter
the
chamber
of
a
king
of
france
your
majesty
will
form
an
exception
if
you
wish
it
but
then
i
shall
avoid
my
responsibility
by
informing
the
king
s
attendant
here
is
my
sword
monsieur
will
you
now
please
to
announce
me
to
his
majesty
instantly
sire
and
the
officer
immediately
went
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
communication
which
the
valet
opened
to
him
his
majesty
the
king
of
england
said
the
officer
his
majesty
the
king
of
england
replied
the
valet
de
chambre
at
these
words
a
gentleman
opened
the
of
the
king
s
apartment
and
louis
xiv
was
seen
without
hat
or
sword
and
his
pourpoint
open
advancing
with
signs
of
the
greatest
surprise
you
my
brother
you
at
blois
cried
louis
dismissing
with
a
gesture
both
the
gentlemen
and
the
valet
de
chambre
who
passed
out
into
the
next
apartment
sire
replied
charles
i
was
going
to
paris
in
the
hope
of
seeing
your
majesty
when
report
informed
me
of
your
approaching
arrival
in
this
city
i
therefore
prolonged
my
abode
here
having
something
very
particular
to
communicate
to
you
will
this
closet
suit
you
my
brother
perfectly
well
sire
for
i
think
no
one
can
hear
us
here
i
have
dismissed
my
gentleman
and
my
watcher
they
are
in
the
next
chamber
there
behind
that
partition
is
a
solitary
closet
looking
into
the
and
in
that
you
found
nobody
but
a
solitary
officer
did
you
no
sire
well
then
speak
my
brother
i
listen
to
you
sire
i
commence
and
entreat
your
majesty
to
have
pity
on
the
misfortunes
of
our
house
the
king
of
france
colored
and
drew
his
chair
closer
to
that
of
the
king
of
england
sire
said
charles
i
have
no
need
to
ask
if
your
majesty
is
acquainted
with
the
details
of
my
deplorable
history
louis
xiv
blushed
this
time
more
strongly
than
before
then
stretching
forth
his
hand
to
that
of
the
king
of
england
my
brother
said
he
i
am
ashamed
to
say
so
but
the
cardinal
scarcely
ever
speaks
of
political
affairs
before
me
still
more
formerly
i
used
to
get
laporte
my
valet
de
chambre
to
read
historical
subjects
to
me
but
he
put
a
stop
to
these
readings
and
took
away
laporte
from
me
so
that
i
beg
my
brother
charles
to
tell
me
all
those
matters
as
to
a
man
who
knows
nothing
well
sire
i
think
that
by
taking
things
from
the
beginning
i
shall
have
a
better
chance
of
touching
the
heart
of
your
majesty
speak
on
my
brother
speak
on
you
know
sire
that
being
called
in
to
edinburgh
during
cromwell
s
expedition
into
ireland
i
was
crowned
at
scone
a
year
after
wounded
in
one
of
the
provinces
he
had
usurped
cromwell
returned
upon
us
to
meet
him
was
my
object
to
leave
scotland
was
my
wish
and
yet
interrupted
the
young
king
scotland
is
almost
your
native
country
is
it
not
my
brother
yes
but
the
scots
were
cruel
compatriots
for
me
sire
they
had
forced
me
to
forsake
the
religion
of
my
fathers
they
had
hung
lord
montrose
the
most
devoted
of
my
servants
because
he
was
not
a
covenanter
and
as
the
poor
martyr
to
whom
they
had
offered
a
favor
when
dying
had
asked
that
his
body
might
be
cut
into
as
many
pieces
as
there
are
cities
in
scotland
in
order
that
evidence
of
his
fidelity
might
be
met
with
everywhere
i
could
not
leave
one
city
or
go
into
another
without
passing
under
some
fragments
of
a
body
which
had
acted
fought
and
breathed
for
me
by
a
bold
almost
desperate
march
i
passed
through
cromwell
s
army
and
entered
england
the
protector
set
out
in
pursuit
of
this
strange
flight
which
had
a
crown
for
its
object
if
i
had
been
able
to
reach
london
before
him
without
doubt
the
prize
of
the
race
would
have
been
mine
but
he
overtook
me
at
worcester
the
genius
of
england
was
no
longer
with
us
but
with
him
on
the
of
september
sire
the
anniversary
of
the
other
battle
of
dunbar
so
fatal
to
the
scots
i
was
conquered
two
thousand
men
fell
around
me
before
i
thought
of
retreating
a
step
at
length
i
was
obliged
to
fly
from
that
moment
my
history
became
a
romance
pursued
with
persistent
inveteracy
i
cut
off
my
hair
i
disguised
myself
as
a
woodman
one
day
spent
amidst
the
branches
of
an
oak
gave
to
that
tree
the
name
of
the
royal
oak
which
it
bears
to
this
day
my
adventures
in
the
county
of
stafford
whence
i
escaped
with
the
daughter
of
my
host
on
a
pillion
behind
me
still
fill
the
tales
of
the
country
firesides
and
would
furnish
matter
for
ballads
i
will
some
day
write
all
this
sire
for
the
instruction
of
my
brother
kings
i
will
first
tell
how
on
arriving
at
the
residence
of
norton
i
met
with
a
court
chaplain
who
was
looking
on
at
a
party
playing
at
skittles
and
an
old
servant
who
named
me
bursting
into
tears
and
who
was
as
near
and
as
certainly
killing
me
by
his
fidelity
as
another
might
have
been
by
treachery
then
i
will
tell
of
my
terrors
yes
sire
of
my
terrors
when
at
the
house
of
colonel
windham
a
farrier
who
came
to
shoe
our
horses
declared
they
had
been
shod
in
the
north
how
strange
murmured
louis
xiv
i
never
heard
anything
of
all
that
i
was
only
told
of
your
embarkation
at
brighelmstone
and
your
landing
in
normandy
the
correct
name
of
the
city
is
brighthelmstone
the
mistake
is
dumas
oh
exclaimed
charles
if
heaven
permits
kings
to
be
thus
ignorant
of
the
histories
of
each
other
how
can
they
render
assistance
to
their
brothers
who
need
it
but
tell
me
continued
louis
how
after
being
so
roughly
received
in
england
you
can
still
hope
for
anything
from
that
unhappy
country
and
that
rebellious
people
oh
sire
since
the
battle
of
worcester
everything
is
changed
there
cromwell
is
dead
after
having
signed
a
treaty
with
france
in
which
his
name
is
placed
above
yours
he
died
on
the
of
september
a
fresh
anniversary
of
the
battles
of
dunbar
and
worcester
his
son
has
succeeded
him
but
certain
men
have
a
family
sire
and
no
heir
the
inheritance
of
oliver
was
too
heavy
for
richard
richard
was
neither
a
republican
nor
a
royalist
richard
allowed
his
guards
to
eat
his
dinner
and
his
generals
to
govern
the
republic
richard
abdicated
the
protectorate
on
the
of
april
more
than
a
year
ago
sire
from
that
time
england
is
nothing
but
a
in
which
the
players
throw
dice
for
the
crown
of
my
father
the
two
most
eager
players
are
lambert
and
monk
well
sire
i
in
my
turn
wish
to
take
part
in
this
game
where
the
stakes
are
thrown
upon
my
royal
mantle
sire
it
only
requires
a
million
to
corrupt
one
of
these
players
and
make
an
ally
of
him
or
two
hundred
of
your
gentlemen
to
drive
them
out
of
my
palace
at
whitehall
as
christ
drove
the
from
the
temple
you
come
then
replied
louis
to
ask
me
for
your
assistance
that
is
to
say
not
only
for
that
which
kings
owe
to
each
other
but
that
which
simple
christians
owe
to
each
other
your
assistance
sire
either
in
money
or
men
your
assistance
sire
and
within
a
month
whether
i
oppose
lambert
to
monk
or
monk
to
lambert
i
shall
have
reconquered
my
paternal
inheritance
without
having
cost
my
country
a
guinea
or
my
subjects
a
drop
of
blood
for
they
are
now
all
drunk
with
revolutions
protectorates
and
republics
and
ask
nothing
better
than
to
fall
staggering
to
sleep
in
the
arms
of
royalty
your
assistance
sire
and
i
shall
owe
you
more
than
i
owe
my
father
my
poor
father
who
bought
at
so
dear
a
rate
the
ruin
of
our
house
you
may
judge
sire
whether
i
am
unhappy
whether
i
am
in
despair
for
i
accuse
my
own
father
and
the
blood
mounted
to
the
pale
face
of
charles
who
remained
for
an
instant
with
his
head
between
his
hands
and
as
if
blinded
by
that
blood
which
appeared
to
revolt
against
the
filial
blasphemy
the
young
king
was
not
less
affected
than
his
elder
brother
he
threw
himself
about
in
his
fauteuil
and
could
not
find
a
single
word
of
reply
charles
to
whom
ten
years
in
age
gave
a
superior
strength
to
master
his
emotions
recovered
his
speech
the
first
sire
said
he
your
reply
i
wait
for
it
as
a
criminal
waits
for
his
sentence
must
i
die
my
brother
replied
the
french
prince
you
ask
of
me
for
a
million
me
who
was
never
possessed
of
a
quarter
of
that
sum
i
possess
nothing
i
am
no
more
king
of
france
than
you
are
king
of
england
i
am
a
name
a
cipher
dressed
in
velvet
that
is
all
i
am
upon
a
visible
throne
that
is
my
only
advantage
over
your
majesty
i
have
nothing
i
can
do
nothing
can
it
be
so
exclaimed
charles
ii
my
brother
said
louis
sinking
his
voice
i
have
undergone
miseries
with
which
my
poorest
gentlemen
are
unacquainted
if
my
poor
laporte
were
here
he
would
tell
you
that
i
have
slept
in
ragged
sheets
through
the
holes
of
which
my
legs
have
passed
he
would
tell
you
that
afterwards
when
i
asked
for
carriages
they
brought
me
conveyances
by
the
rats
of
the
he
would
tell
you
that
when
i
asked
for
my
dinner
the
servants
went
to
the
cardinal
s
kitchen
to
inquire
if
there
were
any
dinner
for
the
king
and
look
this
very
day
even
when
i
am
years
of
age
when
i
have
attained
the
grade
of
the
majority
of
kings
when
i
ought
to
have
the
key
of
the
treasury
the
direction
of
the
policy
the
supremacy
in
peace
and
war
cast
your
eyes
around
me
see
how
i
am
left
look
at
this
abandonment
this
disdain
this
silence
whilst
yonder
look
yonder
view
the
bustle
the
lights
the
homage
there
there
you
see
the
real
king
of
france
my
brother
in
the
cardinal
s
apartments
yes
in
the
cardinal
s
apartments
then
i
am
condemned
sire
louis
xiv
made
no
reply
condemned
is
the
word
for
i
will
never
solicit
him
who
left
my
mother
and
sister
to
die
with
cold
and
hunger
the
daughter
and
of
henry
as
surely
they
would
have
if
de
retz
and
the
parliament
had
not
sent
them
wood
and
bread
to
die
murmured
louis
xiv
well
continued
the
king
of
england
poor
charles
grandson
of
henry
as
you
are
sire
having
neither
parliament
nor
cardinal
de
retz
to
apply
to
will
die
of
hunger
as
his
mother
and
sister
had
nearly
done
louis
knitted
his
brow
and
twisted
violently
the
lace
of
his
ruffles
this
prostration
this
immobility
serving
as
a
mark
to
an
emotion
so
visible
struck
charles
and
he
took
the
young
man
s
hand
thanks
said
he
my
brother
you
pity
me
and
that
is
all
i
can
require
of
you
in
your
present
situation
sire
said
louis
with
a
sudden
impulse
and
raising
his
head
it
is
a
million
you
require
or
two
hundred
gentlemen
i
think
you
say
sire
a
million
would
be
quite
sufficient
that
is
very
little
offered
to
a
single
man
it
is
a
great
deal
convictions
have
been
purchased
at
a
much
lower
price
and
i
should
have
nothing
to
do
but
with
venalities
two
hundred
gentlemen
reflect
that
is
little
more
than
a
single
company
sire
there
is
in
our
family
a
tradition
and
that
is
that
four
men
four
french
gentlemen
devoted
to
my
father
were
near
saving
my
father
though
condemned
by
a
parliament
guarded
by
an
army
and
surrounded
by
a
nation
then
if
i
can
procure
you
a
million
or
two
hundred
gentlemen
you
will
be
satisfied
and
you
will
consider
me
your
brother
i
shall
consider
you
as
my
saviour
and
if
i
recover
the
throne
of
my
father
england
will
be
as
long
as
i
reign
it
a
sister
to
france
as
you
will
have
been
a
brother
to
me
well
my
brother
said
louis
rising
what
you
hesitate
to
ask
for
i
will
myself
demand
that
which
i
have
never
done
on
my
own
account
i
will
do
on
yours
i
will
go
and
find
the
king
of
france
the
other
the
rich
the
powerful
one
i
mean
i
will
myself
solicit
this
million
or
these
two
hundred
gentlemen
and
we
will
see
oh
cried
charles
you
are
a
noble
friend
sire
a
heart
created
by
god
you
save
me
my
brother
and
if
you
should
ever
stand
in
need
of
the
life
you
restored
me
demand
it
silence
my
brother
silence
said
louis
in
a
suppressed
voice
take
care
that
no
one
hears
you
we
have
not
obtained
our
end
yet
to
ask
money
of
mazarin
that
is
worse
than
traversing
the
enchanted
forest
each
tree
of
which
inclosed
a
demon
it
is
more
than
setting
out
to
conquer
a
world
but
yet
sire
when
you
ask
it
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
never
asked
replied
louis
with
a
haughtiness
that
made
the
king
of
england
turn
pale
and
the
latter
like
a
wounded
man
made
a
retreating
movement
pardon
me
my
brother
replied
he
i
have
neither
a
mother
nor
a
sister
who
are
suffering
my
throne
is
hard
and
naked
but
i
am
firmly
seated
on
my
throne
pardon
me
that
expression
my
brother
it
was
that
of
an
egotist
i
will
retract
it
therefore
by
a
sacrifice
i
will
go
to
monsieur
le
cardinal
wait
for
me
if
you
please
i
will
return
chapter
x
the
arithmetic
of
de
mazarin
whilst
the
king
was
directing
his
course
rapidly
towards
the
wing
of
the
castle
occupied
by
the
cardinal
taking
nobody
with
him
but
his
valet
de
chambre
the
officer
of
musketeers
came
out
breathing
like
a
man
who
has
for
a
long
time
been
forced
to
hold
his
breath
from
the
little
cabinet
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
and
which
the
king
believed
to
be
quite
solitary
this
little
cabinet
had
formerly
been
part
of
the
chamber
from
which
it
was
only
separated
by
a
thin
partition
it
resulted
that
this
partition
which
was
only
for
the
eye
permitted
the
ear
the
least
indiscreet
to
hear
every
word
spoken
in
the
chamber
there
was
no
doubt
then
that
this
lieutenant
of
musketeers
had
heard
all
that
passed
in
his
majesty
s
apartment
warned
by
the
last
words
of
the
young
king
he
came
out
just
in
time
to
salute
him
on
his
passage
and
to
follow
him
with
his
eyes
till
he
had
disappeared
in
the
corridor
then
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
he
shook
his
head
after
a
fashion
peculiarly
his
own
and
in
a
voice
which
forty
years
absence
from
gascony
had
not
deprived
of
its
gascon
accent
a
melancholy
service
said
he
and
a
melancholy
master
these
words
pronounced
the
lieutenant
resumed
his
place
in
his
fauteuil
stretched
his
legs
and
closed
his
eyes
like
a
man
who
either
sleeps
or
meditates
during
this
short
monologue
and
the
mise
en
scene
that
had
accompanied
it
whilst
the
king
through
the
long
corridors
of
the
old
castle
proceeded
to
the
apartment
of
de
mazarin
a
scene
of
another
sort
was
being
enacted
in
those
apartments
mazarin
was
in
bed
suffering
a
little
from
the
gout
but
as
he
was
a
man
of
order
who
utilized
even
pain
he
forced
his
wakefulness
to
be
the
humble
servant
of
his
labor
he
had
consequently
ordered
bernouin
his
valet
de
chambre
to
bring
him
a
little
so
that
he
might
write
in
bed
but
the
gout
is
not
an
adversary
that
allows
itself
to
be
conquered
so
easily
therefore
at
each
movement
he
made
the
pain
from
dull
became
sharp
is
brienne
there
asked
he
of
bernouin
no
monseigneur
replied
the
valet
de
chambre
de
brienne
with
your
permission
is
gone
to
bed
but
if
it
is
the
wish
of
your
eminence
he
can
speedily
be
called
no
it
is
not
worth
while
let
us
see
however
cursed
ciphers
and
the
cardinal
began
to
think
counting
on
his
fingers
the
while
oh
ciphers
is
it
said
bernouin
very
well
if
your
eminence
attempts
calculations
i
will
promise
you
a
pretty
headache
and
with
that
please
to
remember
guenaud
is
not
here
you
are
right
bernouin
you
must
take
brienne
s
place
my
friend
indeed
i
ought
to
have
brought
colbert
with
me
that
young
man
goes
on
very
well
bernouin
very
well
a
very
orderly
youth
i
do
not
know
said
the
valet
de
chambre
but
i
don
t
like
the
countenance
of
your
young
man
who
goes
on
so
well
well
well
bernouin
we
don
t
stand
in
need
of
your
advice
place
yourself
there
take
the
pen
and
write
i
am
ready
monseigneur
what
am
i
to
write
there
that
s
the
place
after
the
two
lines
already
traced
i
am
there
write
seven
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
livres
that
is
written
upon
lyons
the
cardinal
appeared
to
hesitate
upon
lyons
repeated
bernouin
three
millions
nine
hundred
thousand
livres
well
monseigneur
upon
bordeaux
seven
millions
seven
repeated
bernouin
yes
said
the
cardinal
pettishly
seven
then
recollecting
himself
you
understand
bernouin
added
he
that
all
this
money
is
to
be
spent
eh
monseigneur
whether
it
be
spent
or
put
away
is
of
very
little
consequence
to
me
since
none
of
these
millions
are
mine
these
millions
are
the
king
s
it
is
the
king
s
money
i
am
reckoning
well
what
were
we
saying
you
always
interrupt
me
seven
millions
upon
bordeaux
ah
yes
that
s
right
upon
madrid
four
millions
i
give
you
to
understand
plainly
to
whom
this
money
belongs
bernouin
seeing
that
everybody
has
the
stupidity
to
believe
me
rich
in
millions
i
repel
the
silly
idea
a
minister
besides
has
nothing
of
his
own
come
go
on
rentrees
generales
seven
millions
properties
nine
millions
have
you
written
that
bernouin
yes
monseigneur
bourse
six
hundred
thousand
livres
various
property
two
millions
ah
i
forgot
the
furniture
of
the
different
chateaux
must
i
put
of
the
crown
asked
bernouin
no
no
it
is
of
no
use
doing
that
that
is
understood
have
you
written
that
bernouin
yes
monseigneur
and
the
ciphers
stand
straight
under
one
another
cast
them
up
bernouin
millions
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
livres
monseigneur
ah
cried
the
cardinal
in
a
tone
of
vexation
there
are
not
yet
forty
millions
bernouin
recommenced
the
addition
no
monseigneur
there
want
seven
hundred
and
forty
thousand
livres
mazarin
asked
for
the
account
and
revised
it
carefully
yes
but
said
bernouin
millions
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
livres
make
a
good
round
sum
ah
bernouin
i
wish
the
king
had
it
your
eminence
told
me
that
this
money
was
his
majesty
s
doubtless
as
clear
as
transparent
as
possible
these
millions
are
bespoken
and
much
more
bernouin
smiled
after
his
own
fashion
that
is
like
a
man
who
believes
no
more
than
he
is
willing
to
believe
whilst
preparing
the
cardinal
s
night
draught
and
putting
his
pillow
to
rights
oh
said
mazarin
when
the
valet
had
gone
out
not
yet
forty
millions
i
must
however
attain
that
sum
which
i
had
set
down
for
myself
but
who
knows
whether
i
shall
have
time
i
sink
i
am
going
i
shall
never
reach
it
and
yet
who
knows
that
i
may
not
find
two
or
three
millions
in
the
pockets
of
my
good
friends
the
spaniards
they
discovered
peru
those
people
did
and
what
the
devil
they
must
have
something
left
as
he
was
speaking
thus
entirely
occupied
with
his
ciphers
and
thinking
no
more
of
his
gout
repelled
by
a
preoccupation
which
with
the
cardinal
was
the
most
powerful
of
all
preoccupations
bernouin
rushed
into
the
chamber
quite
in
a
fright
well
asked
the
cardinal
what
is
the
matter
now
the
king
monseigneur
the
king
how
the
king
said
mazarin
quickly
concealing
his
paper
the
king
here
the
king
at
this
hour
i
thought
he
was
in
bed
long
ago
what
is
the
matter
then
the
king
could
hear
these
last
words
and
see
the
terrified
gesture
of
the
cardinal
rising
up
in
his
bed
for
he
entered
the
chamber
at
that
moment
it
is
nothing
monsieur
le
cardinal
or
at
least
nothing
which
can
alarm
you
it
is
an
important
communication
which
i
wish
to
make
to
your
eminence
that
is
all
mazarin
immediately
thought
of
that
marked
attention
which
the
king
had
given
to
his
words
concerning
mademoiselle
de
mancini
and
the
communication
appeared
to
him
probably
to
refer
to
this
source
he
recovered
his
serenity
then
instantly
and
assumed
his
most
agreeable
air
a
change
of
countenance
which
inspired
the
king
with
the
greatest
joy
and
when
louis
was
seated
sire
said
the
cardinal
i
ought
certainly
to
listen
to
your
majesty
standing
but
the
violence
of
my
complaint
no
ceremony
between
us
my
dear
monsieur
le
cardinal
said
louis
kindly
i
am
your
pupil
and
not
the
king
you
know
very
well
and
this
evening
in
particular
as
i
come
to
you
as
a
petitioner
as
a
solicitor
and
one
very
humble
and
desirous
to
be
kindly
received
too
mazarin
seeing
the
heightened
color
of
the
king
was
confirmed
in
his
first
idea
that
is
to
say
that
love
thoughts
were
hidden
under
all
these
fine
words
this
time
political
cunning
as
keen
as
it
was
made
a
mistake
this
color
was
not
caused
by
the
bashfulness
of
a
juvenile
passion
but
only
by
the
painful
contraction
of
the
royal
pride
like
a
good
uncle
mazarin
felt
disposed
to
facilitate
the
confidence
speak
sire
said
he
and
since
your
majesty
is
willing
for
an
instant
to
forget
that
i
am
your
subject
and
call
me
your
master
and
instructor
i
promise
your
majesty
my
most
devoted
and
tender
consideration
thanks
monsieur
le
cardinal
answered
the
king
that
which
i
have
to
ask
of
your
eminence
has
but
little
to
do
with
myself
so
much
the
worse
replied
the
cardinal
so
much
the
worse
sire
i
should
wish
your
majesty
to
ask
of
me
something
of
importance
even
a
sacrifice
but
whatever
it
may
be
that
you
ask
me
i
am
ready
to
set
your
heart
at
rest
by
granting
it
my
dear
sire
well
this
is
what
brings
me
here
said
the
king
with
a
beating
of
the
heart
that
had
no
equal
except
the
beating
of
the
heart
of
the
minister
i
have
just
received
a
visit
from
my
brother
the
king
of
england
mazarin
bounded
in
his
bed
as
if
he
had
been
put
in
relation
with
a
leyden
jar
or
a
voltaic
pile
at
the
same
time
that
a
surprise
or
rather
a
manifest
disappointment
inflamed
his
features
with
such
a
blaze
of
anger
that
louis
little
diplomatist
as
he
was
saw
that
the
minister
had
hoped
to
hear
something
else
charles
exclaimed
mazarin
with
a
hoarse
voice
and
a
disdainful
movement
of
his
lips
you
have
received
a
visit
from
charles
from
king
charles
replied
louis
according
in
a
marked
manner
to
the
grandson
of
henry
iv
the
title
which
mazarin
had
forgotten
to
give
him
yes
monsieur
le
cardinal
that
unhappy
prince
has
touched
my
heart
with
the
relation
of
his
misfortunes
his
distress
is
great
monsieur
le
cardinal
and
it
has
appeared
painful
to
me
who
have
seen
my
own
throne
disputed
who
have
been
forced
in
times
of
commotion
to
quit
my
capital
to
me
in
short
who
am
acquainted
with
misfortune
to
leave
a
deposed
and
fugitive
brother
without
assistance
eh
said
the
cardinal
sharply
why
had
he
not
as
you
have
a
jules
mazarin
by
his
side
his
crown
would
then
have
remained
intact
i
know
all
that
my
house
owes
to
your
eminence
replied
the
king
haughtily
and
you
may
well
believe
that
i
on
my
part
shall
never
forget
it
it
is
precisely
because
my
brother
the
king
of
england
has
not
about
him
the
powerful
genius
who
has
saved
me
it
is
for
that
i
say
that
i
wish
to
conciliate
the
aid
of
that
same
genius
and
beg
you
to
extend
your
arm
over
his
head
well
assured
monsieur
le
cardinal
that
your
hand
by
touching
him
only
would
know
how
to
replace
upon
his
brow
the
crown
which
fell
at
the
foot
of
his
father
s
scaffold
sire
replied
mazarin
i
thank
you
for
your
good
opinion
with
regard
to
myself
but
we
have
nothing
to
do
yonder
they
are
a
set
of
madmen
who
deny
god
and
cut
off
the
heads
of
their
kings
they
are
dangerous
observe
sire
and
filthy
to
the
touch
after
having
wallowed
in
royal
blood
and
covenantal
murder
that
policy
has
never
suited
me
i
scorn
it
and
reject
it
therefore
you
ought
to
assist
in
establishing
a
better
what
is
that
the
restoration
of
charles
for
example
good
heavens
cried
mazarin
does
the
poor
prince
flatter
himself
with
that
chimera
yes
he
does
replied
the
young
king
terrified
at
the
difficulties
opposed
to
this
project
which
he
fancied
he
could
perceive
in
the
infallible
eye
of
his
minister
he
only
asks
for
a
million
to
carry
out
his
purpose
is
that
all
a
little
million
if
you
please
said
the
cardinal
ironically
with
an
effort
to
conquer
his
italian
accent
a
little
million
if
you
please
brother
bah
a
family
of
mendicants
cardinal
said
louis
raising
his
head
that
family
of
mendicants
is
a
branch
of
my
family
are
you
rich
enough
to
give
millions
to
other
people
sire
have
you
millions
to
throw
away
oh
replied
louis
with
great
pain
which
he
however
by
a
strong
effort
prevented
from
appearing
on
his
countenance
oh
yes
monsieur
le
cardinal
i
am
well
aware
i
am
poor
and
yet
the
crown
of
france
is
worth
a
million
and
to
perform
a
good
action
i
would
pledge
my
crown
if
it
were
necessary
i
could
find
jews
who
would
be
willing
to
lend
me
a
million
so
sire
you
say
you
want
a
million
said
mazarin
yes
monsieur
i
say
so
you
are
mistaken
greatly
mistaken
sire
you
want
much
more
than
that
bernouin
you
shall
see
sire
how
much
you
really
want
what
cardinal
said
the
king
are
you
going
to
consult
a
lackey
about
my
affairs
bernouin
cried
the
cardinal
again
without
appearing
to
remark
the
humiliation
of
the
young
prince
come
here
bernouin
and
tell
me
the
figures
i
gave
you
just
now
cardinal
cardinal
did
you
not
hear
me
said
louis
turning
pale
with
anger
do
not
be
angry
sire
i
deal
openly
with
the
affairs
of
your
majesty
every
one
in
france
knows
that
my
books
are
as
open
as
day
what
did
i
tell
you
to
do
just
now
bernouin
your
eminence
commanded
me
to
cast
up
an
account
you
did
it
did
you
not
yes
my
lord
to
verify
the
amount
of
which
his
majesty
at
this
moment
stands
in
need
did
i
not
tell
you
so
be
frank
my
friend
your
eminence
said
so
well
what
sum
did
i
say
i
wanted
millions
i
think
and
what
sum
could
we
find
after
collecting
all
our
resources
millions
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
that
is
correct
bernouin
that
is
all
i
wanted
to
know
leave
us
now
said
the
cardinal
fixing
his
brilliant
eye
upon
the
young
king
who
sat
mute
with
stupefaction
however
stammered
the
king
what
do
you
still
doubt
sire
said
the
cardinal
well
here
is
a
proof
of
what
i
said
and
mazarin
drew
from
under
his
bolster
the
paper
covered
with
figures
which
he
presented
to
the
king
who
turned
away
his
eyes
his
vexation
was
so
deep
therefore
as
it
is
a
million
you
want
sire
and
that
million
is
not
set
down
here
it
is
millions
your
majesty
stands
in
need
of
well
i
don
t
think
that
any
jews
in
the
world
would
lend
such
a
sum
even
upon
the
crown
of
france
the
king
clenching
his
hands
beneath
his
ruffles
pushed
away
his
chair
so
it
must
be
then
said
he
my
brother
the
king
of
england
will
die
of
hunger
sire
replied
mazarin
in
the
same
tone
remember
this
proverb
which
i
give
you
as
the
expression
of
the
soundest
policy
rejoice
at
being
poor
when
your
neighbor
is
poor
louis
meditated
this
for
a
few
moments
with
an
inquisitive
glance
directed
to
the
paper
one
end
of
which
remained
under
the
bolster
then
said
he
it
is
impossible
to
comply
with
my
demand
for
money
my
lord
cardinal
is
it
absolutely
sire
remember
this
will
secure
me
a
future
enemy
if
he
succeed
in
recovering
his
crown
without
my
assistance
if
your
majesty
only
fears
that
you
may
be
quite
at
ease
replied
mazarin
eagerly
very
well
i
say
no
more
about
it
exclaimed
louis
xiv
have
i
at
least
convinced
you
sire
placing
his
hand
upon
that
of
the
young
king
perfectly
if
there
be
anything
else
ask
it
sire
i
shall
most
happy
to
grant
it
to
you
having
refused
this
anything
else
my
lord
why
yes
am
i
not
devoted
body
and
soul
to
your
majesty
hola
bernouin
lights
and
guards
for
his
majesty
his
majesty
is
returning
to
his
own
chamber
not
yet
monsieur
since
you
place
your
at
my
disposal
i
will
take
advantage
of
it
for
yourself
sire
asked
the
cardinal
hoping
that
his
niece
was
at
length
about
to
be
named
no
monsieur
not
for
myself
replied
louis
but
still
for
my
brother
charles
the
brow
of
mazarin
again
became
clouded
and
he
grumbled
a
few
words
that
the
king
could
not
catch
chapter
xi
mazarin
s
policy
instead
of
the
hesitation
with
which
he
had
accosted
the
cardinal
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
there
might
be
read
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
king
that
will
against
which
a
struggle
might
be
maintained
and
which
might
be
crushed
by
its
own
impotence
but
which
at
least
would
preserve
like
a
wound
in
the
depth
of
the
heart
the
remembrance
of
its
defeat
this
time
my
lord
cardinal
we
have
to
deal
with
something
more
easily
found
than
a
million
do
you
think
so
sire
said
mazarin
looking
at
the
king
with
that
penetrating
eye
which
was
accustomed
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
hearts
yes
i
think
so
and
when
you
know
the
object
of
my
request
and
do
you
think
i
do
not
know
it
sire
you
know
what
remains
for
me
to
say
to
you
listen
sire
these
are
king
charles
s
own
words
oh
impossible
listen
and
if
that
miserly
beggarly
italian
said
he
my
lord
cardinal
that
is
the
sense
if
not
the
words
eh
good
heavens
i
wish
him
no
ill
on
that
account
one
is
biased
by
his
passions
he
said
to
you
if
that
vile
italian
refuses
the
million
we
ask
of
him
sire
if
we
are
forced
for
want
of
money
to
renounce
diplomacy
well
then
we
will
ask
him
to
grant
us
five
hundred
the
king
started
for
the
cardinal
was
only
mistaken
in
the
number
is
not
that
it
sire
cried
the
minister
with
a
triumphant
accent
and
then
he
added
some
fine
words
he
said
i
have
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
and
these
friends
only
want
a
leader
and
a
banner
when
they
see
me
when
they
behold
the
banner
of
france
they
will
rally
around
me
for
they
will
comprehend
that
i
have
your
support
the
colors
of
the
french
uniform
will
be
worth
as
much
to
me
as
the
million
de
mazarin
refuses
us
for
he
was
pretty
well
assured
i
should
refuse
him
that
i
shall
conquer
with
these
five
hundred
gentlemen
sire
and
all
the
honor
will
be
now
that
is
what
he
said
or
to
that
purpose
was
it
not
turning
those
plain
words
into
brilliant
metaphors
and
pompous
images
for
they
are
fine
talkers
in
that
family
the
father
talked
even
on
the
scaffold
the
perspiration
of
shame
stood
on
the
brow
of
louis
he
felt
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
his
dignity
to
hear
his
brother
thus
insulted
but
he
did
not
yet
know
how
to
act
with
him
to
whom
every
one
yielded
even
his
mother
at
last
he
made
an
effort
but
said
he
my
lord
cardinal
it
is
not
five
hundred
men
it
is
only
two
hundred
well
but
you
see
i
guessed
what
he
wanted
i
never
denied
that
you
had
a
penetrating
eye
and
that
was
why
i
thought
you
would
not
refuse
my
brother
charles
a
thing
so
simple
and
so
easy
to
grant
him
as
what
i
ask
of
you
in
his
name
my
lord
cardinal
or
rather
in
my
own
sire
said
mazarin
i
have
studied
policy
thirty
years
first
under
the
auspices
of
le
cardinal
richelieu
and
then
alone
this
policy
has
not
always
been
it
must
be
allowed
but
it
has
never
been
unskillful
now
that
which
is
proposed
to
your
majesty
is
dishonest
and
unskillful
at
the
same
time
dishonest
monsieur
sire
you
entered
into
a
treaty
with
cromwell
yes
and
in
that
very
treaty
cromwell
signed
his
name
above
mine
why
did
you
sign
yours
so
lo
down
sire
cromwell
found
a
good
place
and
he
took
it
that
was
his
custom
i
return
then
to
cromwell
you
have
a
treaty
with
him
that
is
to
say
with
england
since
when
you
signed
that
treaty
cromwell
was
england
cromwell
is
dead
do
you
think
so
sire
no
doubt
he
is
since
his
son
richard
has
succeeded
him
and
has
abdicated
yes
that
is
it
exactly
richard
inherited
after
the
death
of
his
father
and
england
at
the
abdication
of
richard
the
treaty
formed
part
of
the
inheritance
whether
in
the
hands
of
richard
or
in
the
hands
of
england
the
treaty
is
then
still
as
good
as
valid
as
ever
why
should
you
evade
it
sire
what
is
changed
charles
wants
what
we
were
not
willing
to
grant
him
ten
years
ago
but
that
was
foreseen
and
provided
against
you
are
the
ally
of
england
sire
and
not
of
charles
ii
it
was
doubtless
wrong
from
a
family
point
of
view
to
sign
a
treaty
with
a
man
who
had
cut
off
the
head
of
the
king
your
father
s
and
to
contract
an
alliance
with
a
parliament
which
they
call
yonder
the
rump
parliament
it
was
unbecoming
i
acknowledge
but
it
was
not
unskillful
from
a
political
point
of
view
since
thanks
to
that
treaty
i
saved
your
majesty
then
a
minor
the
trouble
and
danger
of
a
foreign
war
which
the
fronde
you
remember
the
fronde
sire
the
young
king
hung
his
head
which
the
fronde
might
have
fatally
complicated
and
thus
i
prove
to
your
majesty
that
to
change
our
plan
now
without
warning
our
allies
would
be
at
once
unskillful
and
dishonest
we
should
make
war
with
the
aggression
on
our
side
we
should
make
it
deserving
to
have
it
made
against
us
and
we
should
have
the
appearance
of
fearing
it
whilst
provoking
it
for
a
permission
granted
to
five
hundred
men
to
two
hundred
men
to
fifty
men
to
ten
men
is
still
a
permission
one
frenchman
that
is
the
nation
one
uniform
that
is
the
army
suppose
sire
for
example
that
you
should
have
war
with
holland
which
sooner
or
later
will
certainly
happen
or
with
spain
which
will
perhaps
ensue
if
your
marriage
fails
mazarin
stole
a
furtive
glance
at
the
king
and
there
are
a
thousand
causes
that
might
yet
make
your
marriage
fail
well
would
you
approve
of
england
s
sending
to
the
united
provinces
or
to
spain
a
regiment
a
company
a
squadron
even
of
english
gentlemen
would
you
think
that
they
kept
within
the
limits
of
their
treaty
of
alliance
louis
listened
it
seemed
so
strange
to
him
that
mazarin
should
invoke
good
faith
and
he
the
author
of
so
many
political
tricks
called
mazarinades
and
yet
said
the
king
without
manifest
of
my
authorization
i
can
not
prevent
gentlemen
of
my
states
from
passing
over
into
england
if
such
should
be
their
good
pleasure
you
should
compel
them
to
return
sire
or
at
least
protest
against
their
presence
as
enemies
in
a
allied
country
but
come
my
lord
cardinal
you
who
are
so
profound
a
genius
try
if
you
can
not
find
a
means
to
assist
this
poor
king
without
compromising
ourselves
and
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
not
willing
to
do
my
dear
sire
said
mazarin
if
england
were
to
act
exactly
according
to
my
wishes
she
could
not
act
better
than
she
does
if
i
directed
the
policy
of
england
from
this
place
i
should
not
direct
it
otherwise
governed
as
she
is
governed
england
is
an
eternal
nest
of
contention
for
all
europe
holland
protects
charles
let
holland
do
so
they
will
quarrel
they
will
fight
let
them
destroy
each
other
s
navies
we
can
construct
ours
with
the
wrecks
of
their
vessels
when
we
shall
save
our
money
to
buy
nails
oh
how
paltry
and
mean
is
all
this
that
you
are
telling
me
monsieur
le
cardinal
yes
but
nevertheless
it
is
true
sire
you
must
confess
that
still
further
suppose
i
admit
for
a
moment
the
possibility
of
breaking
your
word
and
evading
the
treaty
such
a
thing
as
sometimes
happens
but
that
is
when
some
great
interest
is
to
be
promoted
by
it
or
when
the
treaty
is
found
to
be
too
troublesome
well
you
will
authorize
the
engagement
asked
of
you
france
her
banner
which
is
the
same
thing
will
cross
the
straits
and
will
fight
france
will
be
conquered
why
so
ma
foi
we
have
a
pretty
general
to
fight
under
this
charles
worcester
gave
us
proofs
of
that
but
he
will
no
longer
have
to
deal
with
cromwell
monsieur
but
he
will
have
to
deal
with
monk
who
is
quite
as
dangerous
the
brave
brewer
of
whom
we
are
speaking
was
a
visionary
he
had
moments
of
exaltation
of
inflation
during
which
he
ran
over
like
an
cask
and
from
the
chinks
there
always
escaped
some
drops
of
his
thoughts
and
by
the
sample
the
whole
of
his
thought
was
to
be
made
out
cromwell
has
thus
allowed
us
more
than
ten
times
to
penetrate
into
his
very
soul
when
one
would
have
conceived
that
soul
to
be
enveloped
in
triple
brass
as
horace
had
it
but
monk
oh
sire
god
defend
you
from
ever
having
anything
to
transact
politically
with
monk
it
is
he
who
has
given
me
in
one
year
all
the
gray
hairs
i
have
monk
is
no
fanatic
unfortunately
he
is
a
politician
he
does
not
overflow
he
keeps
close
together
for
ten
years
he
has
had
his
eyes
fixed
upon
one
object
and
nobody
has
yet
been
able
to
ascertain
what
every
morning
as
louis
xi
advised
he
burns
his
nightcap
therefore
on
the
day
when
this
plan
slowly
and
solitarily
ripened
shall
break
forth
it
will
break
forth
with
all
the
conditions
of
success
which
always
accompany
an
unforeseen
event
that
is
monk
sire
of
whom
perhaps
you
have
never
even
heard
of
whom
perhaps
you
did
not
even
know
the
name
before
your
brother
charles
who
knows
what
he
is
pronounced
it
before
you
he
is
a
marvel
of
depth
and
tenacity
the
two
only
things
against
which
intelligence
and
ardor
are
blunted
sire
i
had
ardor
when
i
was
young
i
always
was
intelligent
i
may
safely
boast
of
it
because
i
am
reproached
with
it
i
have
done
very
well
with
these
two
qualities
since
from
the
son
of
a
fisherman
of
piscina
i
have
become
prime
minister
to
the
king
of
france
and
in
that
position
your
majesty
will
perhaps
acknowledge
i
have
rendered
some
service
to
the
throne
of
your
majesty
well
sire
if
i
had
met
with
monk
on
my
way
instead
of
monsieur
de
beaufort
monsieur
de
retz
or
monsieur
le
prince
well
we
should
have
been
ruined
if
you
engage
yourself
rashly
sire
you
will
fall
into
the
talons
of
this
politic
soldier
the
casque
of
monk
sire
is
an
iron
coffer
and
no
one
has
the
key
of
it
therefore
near
him
or
rather
before
him
i
bow
sire
for
i
have
nothing
but
a
velvet
cap
what
do
you
think
monk
wishes
to
do
then
eh
sire
if
i
knew
that
i
would
not
tell
you
to
mistrust
him
for
i
should
be
stronger
than
he
but
with
him
i
am
afraid
to
guess
to
guess
you
understand
my
word
for
if
i
thought
i
had
guessed
i
should
stop
at
an
idea
and
in
spite
of
myself
should
pursue
that
idea
since
that
man
has
been
in
power
yonder
i
am
like
one
of
the
damned
in
dante
whose
neck
satan
has
twisted
and
who
walk
forward
looking
around
behind
them
i
am
traveling
towards
madrid
but
i
never
lose
sight
of
london
to
guess
with
that
devil
of
a
man
is
to
deceive
one
s
self
and
to
deceive
one
s
self
is
to
ruin
one
s
self
god
keep
me
from
ever
seeking
to
guess
what
he
aims
at
i
confine
myself
to
watching
what
he
does
and
that
is
well
enough
now
i
believe
you
observe
the
meaning
of
the
word
i
believe
i
believe
with
respect
to
monk
ties
one
to
nothing
i
believe
that
he
has
a
strong
inclination
to
succeed
cromwell
your
charles
ii
has
already
caused
proposals
to
be
made
to
him
by
ten
persons
he
has
satisfied
himself
with
driving
these
ten
meddlers
from
his
presence
without
saying
anything
to
them
but
begone
or
i
will
have
you
that
man
is
a
sepulcher
at
this
moment
monk
is
affecting
devotion
to
the
rump
parliament
of
this
devotion
i
am
not
the
dupe
monk
has
no
wish
to
be
assassinated
an
assassination
would
stop
him
in
the
middle
of
his
operations
and
his
work
must
be
accomplished
so
i
believe
but
do
not
believe
what
i
believe
sire
for
as
i
say
i
believe
from
habit
i
believe
that
monk
is
keeping
on
friendly
terms
with
the
parliament
till
the
day
comes
for
dispersing
it
you
are
asked
for
swords
but
they
are
to
fight
against
monk
god
preserve
you
from
fighting
against
monk
sire
for
monk
would
beat
us
and
i
should
never
console
myself
after
being
beaten
by
monk
i
should
say
to
myself
monk
has
foreseen
that
victory
ten
years
for
god
s
sake
sire
out
of
friendship
for
you
if
not
out
of
consideration
for
himself
let
charles
ii
keep
quiet
your
majesty
will
give
him
a
little
income
here
give
him
one
of
your
chateaux
yes
yes
wait
awhile
but
i
forget
the
treaty
that
famous
treaty
of
which
we
were
just
now
speaking
your
majesty
has
not
even
the
right
to
give
him
a
chateau
how
is
that
yes
yes
your
majesty
is
bound
not
to
grant
hospitality
to
king
charles
and
to
compel
him
to
leave
france
even
it
was
on
this
account
we
forced
him
to
quit
you
and
yet
here
he
is
again
sire
i
hope
you
will
give
your
brother
to
understand
that
he
can
not
remain
with
us
that
it
is
impossible
he
should
be
allowed
to
compromise
us
or
i
myself
enough
my
lord
said
louis
rising
in
refusing
me
a
million
perhaps
you
may
be
right
your
millions
are
your
own
in
refusing
me
two
hundred
gentlemen
you
are
still
further
in
the
right
for
you
are
prime
minister
and
you
have
in
the
eyes
of
france
the
responsibility
of
peace
and
war
but
that
you
should
pretend
to
prevent
me
who
am
king
from
extending
my
hospitality
to
the
grandson
of
henry
to
my
to
the
companion
of
my
childhood
there
your
power
stops
and
there
begins
my
will
sire
said
mazarin
delighted
at
being
let
off
so
cheaply
and
who
had
besides
only
fought
so
earnestly
to
arrive
at
that
sire
i
shall
always
bend
before
the
will
of
my
king
let
my
king
then
keep
near
him
or
in
one
of
his
chateaux
the
king
of
england
let
mazarin
know
it
but
let
not
the
minister
know
it
my
lord
said
louis
i
go
away
in
despair
but
convinced
and
that
is
all
i
desire
sire
replied
mazarin
the
king
made
no
answer
and
retired
quite
pensive
convinced
not
of
all
mazarin
had
told
him
but
of
one
thing
which
he
took
care
not
to
mention
to
him
and
that
was
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
study
seriously
both
his
own
affairs
and
those
of
europe
for
he
found
them
very
difficult
and
very
obscure
louis
found
the
king
of
england
seated
in
the
same
place
where
he
had
left
him
on
perceiving
him
the
english
prince
arose
but
at
the
first
glance
he
saw
discouragement
written
in
dark
letters
upon
his
cousin
s
brow
then
speaking
first
as
if
to
facilitate
the
painful
avowal
that
louis
had
to
make
to
him
whatever
it
may
be
said
he
i
shall
never
forget
all
the
kindness
all
the
friendship
you
have
exhibited
towards
me
alas
replied
louis
in
a
melancholy
tone
only
barren
my
brother
charles
ii
became
extremely
pale
he
passed
his
cold
hand
over
his
brow
and
struggled
for
a
few
instants
against
a
faintness
that
made
him
tremble
i
understand
said
he
at
last
no
more
hope
louis
seized
the
hand
of
charles
ii
wait
my
brother
said
he
precipitate
nothing
everything
may
change
hasty
resolutions
ruin
all
causes
add
another
year
of
trial
i
implore
you
to
the
years
you
have
already
undergone
you
have
to
induce
you
to
act
now
rather
than
at
another
time
neither
occasion
nor
opportunity
come
with
me
my
brother
i
will
give
you
one
of
my
residences
whichever
you
prefer
to
inhabit
i
with
you
will
keep
my
eyes
upon
events
we
will
prepare
come
then
my
brother
have
courage
charles
ii
withdrew
his
hand
from
that
of
the
king
and
drawing
back
to
salute
him
with
more
ceremony
with
all
my
heart
thanks
replied
he
sire
but
i
have
prayed
without
success
to
the
greatest
king
on
earth
now
i
will
go
and
ask
a
miracle
of
god
and
he
went
out
without
being
willing
to
hear
any
more
his
head
carried
loftily
his
hand
trembling
with
a
painful
contraction
of
his
noble
countenance
and
that
profound
gloom
which
finding
no
more
hope
in
the
world
of
men
appeared
to
go
beyond
it
and
ask
it
in
worlds
unknown
the
officer
of
musketeers
on
seeing
him
pass
by
thus
pale
bowed
almost
to
his
knees
as
he
saluted
him
he
then
took
a
flambeau
called
two
musketeers
and
descended
the
deserted
staircase
with
the
unfortunate
king
holding
in
his
left
hand
his
hat
the
plume
of
which
swept
the
steps
arrived
at
the
door
the
musketeer
asked
the
king
which
way
he
was
going
that
he
might
direct
the
musketeers
monsieur
replied
charles
in
a
subdued
voice
you
who
have
known
my
father
say
did
you
ever
pray
for
him
if
you
have
done
so
do
not
forget
me
in
your
prayers
now
i
am
going
alone
and
beg
of
you
not
to
accompany
me
or
have
me
accompanied
any
further
the
officer
bowed
and
sent
away
the
musketeers
into
the
interior
of
the
palace
but
he
himself
remained
an
instant
under
the
porch
watching
the
departing
charles
till
he
was
lost
in
the
turn
of
the
next
street
to
him
as
to
his
father
formerly
murmured
he
athos
if
he
were
here
would
say
with
reason
salute
fallen
majesty
then
reascending
the
staircase
oh
the
vile
service
that
i
follow
said
he
at
every
step
oh
my
pitiful
master
life
thus
carried
on
is
no
longer
tolerable
and
it
is
at
length
time
that
i
should
do
something
no
more
generosity
no
more
energy
the
master
has
succeeded
the
pupil
is
starved
forever
mordioux
i
will
not
resist
come
you
men
continued
he
entering
the
why
are
you
all
looking
at
me
so
extinguish
these
torches
and
return
to
your
posts
ah
you
were
guarding
me
yes
you
watch
over
me
do
you
not
worthy
fellows
brave
fools
i
am
not
the
duc
de
guise
begone
they
will
not
assassinate
me
in
the
little
passage
besides
added
he
in
a
low
voice
that
would
be
a
resolution
and
no
resolutions
have
been
formed
since
monsieur
le
cardinal
richelieu
died
now
with
all
his
faults
that
was
a
man
it
is
settled
i
will
throw
my
cassock
to
the
nettles
then
reflecting
no
said
he
not
yet
i
have
one
great
trial
to
make
and
i
will
make
it
but
that
and
i
swear
it
shall
be
the
last
mordioux
he
had
not
finished
speaking
when
a
voice
issued
from
the
king
s
chamber
monsieur
le
lieutenant
said
this
voice
here
i
am
replied
he
the
king
desires
to
speak
to
you
humph
said
the
lieutenant
perhaps
of
what
i
was
thinking
about
and
he
went
into
the
king
s
apartment
chapter
xii
the
king
and
the
lieutenant
as
soon
as
the
king
saw
the
officer
enter
he
dismissed
his
valet
de
chambre
and
his
gentleman
who
is
on
duty
monsieur
asked
he
the
lieutenant
bowed
his
head
with
military
politeness
and
replied
i
am
sire
what
still
you
always
i
sire
how
can
that
be
monsieur
sire
when
traveling
the
musketeers
supply
all
the
posts
of
your
majesty
s
household
that
is
to
say
yours
her
majesty
the
queen
s
and
monsieur
le
cardinal
s
the
latter
of
whom
borrows
of
the
king
the
best
part
or
rather
the
numerous
part
of
the
royal
guard
but
in
the
interims
there
are
no
interims
sire
but
for
twenty
or
thirty
men
who
rest
out
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
at
the
louvre
it
is
very
different
and
if
i
were
at
the
louvre
i
should
rely
upon
my
brigadier
but
when
traveling
sire
no
one
knows
what
may
happen
and
i
prefer
doing
my
duty
myself
then
you
are
on
guard
every
day
and
every
night
yes
sire
monsieur
i
can
not
allow
that
i
will
have
you
rest
that
is
very
kind
sire
but
i
will
not
what
do
you
say
said
the
king
who
did
not
at
first
comprehend
the
full
meaning
of
this
reply
i
say
sire
that
i
will
not
expose
myself
to
the
chance
of
a
fault
if
the
devil
had
a
trick
to
play
on
me
you
understand
sire
as
he
knows
the
man
with
whom
he
has
to
deal
he
would
chose
the
moment
when
i
should
not
be
there
my
duty
and
the
peace
of
my
conscience
before
everything
sire
but
such
duty
will
kill
you
monsieur
eh
sire
i
have
performed
it
for
thirty
years
and
in
all
france
and
navarre
there
is
not
a
man
in
better
health
than
i
am
moreover
i
entreat
you
sire
not
to
trouble
yourself
about
me
that
would
appear
very
strange
to
me
seeing
that
i
am
not
accustomed
to
it
the
king
cut
short
the
conversation
by
a
fresh
question
shall
you
be
here
then
morning
as
at
present
yes
sire
the
king
walked
several
times
up
and
down
his
chamber
it
was
very
plain
that
he
burned
with
a
desire
to
speak
but
that
he
was
restrained
by
some
fear
or
other
the
lieutenant
standing
motionless
hat
in
hand
watched
him
making
these
evolutions
and
whilst
looking
at
him
grumbled
to
himself
biting
his
mustache
he
has
not
half
a
crown
worth
of
resolution
parole
d
honneur
i
would
lay
a
wager
he
does
not
speak
at
all
the
king
continued
to
walk
about
casting
from
time
to
time
a
side
glance
at
the
lieutenant
he
is
the
very
image
of
his
father
continued
the
latter
in
is
secret
soliloquy
he
is
at
once
proud
avaricious
and
timid
the
devil
take
his
master
say
i
the
king
stopped
lieutenant
said
he
i
am
here
sire
why
did
you
cry
out
this
evening
down
below
in
the
salons
the
king
s
service
his
majesty
s
musketeers
because
you
gave
me
the
order
sire
i
yourself
indeed
i
did
not
say
a
word
monsieur
sire
an
order
is
given
by
a
sign
by
a
gesture
by
a
glance
as
intelligibly
as
freely
and
as
clearly
as
by
word
of
mouth
a
servant
who
has
nothing
but
ears
is
not
half
a
good
servant
your
eyes
are
very
penetrating
then
monsieur
how
is
that
sire
because
they
see
what
is
not
my
eyes
are
good
though
sire
although
they
have
served
their
master
long
and
much
when
they
have
anything
to
see
they
seldom
miss
the
opportunity
now
this
evening
they
saw
that
your
majesty
colored
with
endeavoring
to
conceal
the
inclination
to
yawn
that
your
majesty
looked
with
eloquent
supplications
first
to
his
eminence
and
then
at
her
majesty
the
and
at
length
to
the
entrance
door
and
they
so
thoroughly
remarked
all
i
have
said
that
they
saw
your
majesty
s
lips
articulate
these
words
who
will
get
me
out
of
this
monsieur
or
something
to
this
effect
sire
my
musketeers
i
could
then
no
longer
hesitate
that
look
was
for
me
i
cried
out
instantly
his
majesty
s
musketeers
and
besides
that
was
shown
to
be
true
sire
not
only
by
your
majesty
s
not
saying
i
was
wrong
but
proving
i
was
right
by
going
out
at
once
the
king
turned
away
to
smile
then
after
a
few
seconds
he
again
fixed
his
limpid
eye
upon
that
countenance
so
intelligent
so
bold
and
so
firm
that
it
might
have
been
said
to
be
the
proud
and
energetic
profile
of
the
eagle
facing
the
sun
that
is
all
very
well
said
he
after
a
short
silence
during
which
he
endeavored
in
vain
to
make
his
officer
lower
his
eyes
but
seeing
the
king
said
no
more
the
latter
pirouetted
on
his
heels
and
took
three
steps
towards
the
door
muttering
he
will
not
speak
mordioux
he
will
not
speak
thank
you
monsieur
said
the
king
at
last
humph
continued
the
lieutenant
there
was
only
wanting
that
blamed
for
having
been
less
of
a
fool
than
another
might
have
been
and
he
went
to
the
door
allowing
his
spurs
to
jingle
in
true
military
style
but
when
he
was
on
the
threshold
feeling
the
king
s
desire
drew
him
back
he
returned
has
your
majesty
told
me
all
asked
he
in
a
tone
we
can
not
describe
but
which
without
appearing
to
solicit
the
royal
confidence
contained
so
much
persuasive
frankness
that
the
king
immediately
replied
yes
but
draw
near
monsieur
now
then
murmured
the
officer
he
is
coming
to
it
at
last
listen
to
me
i
shall
not
lose
a
word
sire
you
will
mount
on
horseback
at
about
four
in
the
morning
and
you
will
have
a
horse
saddled
for
me
from
your
majesty
s
stables
no
one
of
your
musketeers
horses
very
well
sire
is
that
all
and
you
will
accompany
me
alone
alone
shall
i
come
to
seek
your
majesty
or
shall
i
wait
you
will
wait
for
me
where
sire
at
the
little
the
lieutenant
bowed
understanding
that
the
king
had
told
him
all
he
had
to
say
in
fact
the
king
dismissed
him
with
a
gracious
wave
of
the
hand
the
officer
left
the
chamber
of
the
king
and
returned
to
place
himself
philosophically
in
his
fauteuil
where
far
from
sleeping
as
might
have
been
expected
considering
how
late
it
was
he
began
to
reflect
more
deeply
than
he
had
ever
reflected
before
the
result
of
these
reflections
was
not
so
melancholy
as
the
preceding
ones
had
been
come
he
has
begun
said
he
love
urges
him
on
and
he
goes
forward
he
goes
forward
the
king
is
nobody
in
his
own
palace
but
the
man
perhaps
may
prove
to
be
worth
something
well
we
shall
see
morning
oh
oh
cried
he
all
at
once
starting
up
that
is
a
gigantic
idea
mordioux
and
perhaps
my
fortune
depends
at
least
upon
that
idea
after
this
exclamation
the
officer
arose
and
marched
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
justaucorps
about
the
immense
that
served
him
as
an
apartment
the
flamed
furiously
under
the
effects
of
a
fresh
breeze
which
stole
in
through
the
chinks
of
the
door
and
the
window
and
cut
the
salle
diagonally
it
threw
out
a
reddish
unequal
light
sometimes
brilliant
sometimes
dull
and
the
tall
shadow
of
the
lieutenant
was
seen
marching
on
the
wall
in
profile
like
a
figure
by
callot
with
his
long
sword
and
feathered
hat
certainly
said
he
i
am
mistaken
if
mazarin
is
not
laying
a
snare
for
this
amorous
boy
mazarin
this
evening
gave
an
address
and
made
an
appointment
as
complacently
as
daangeau
himself
could
have
done
i
heard
him
and
i
know
the
meaning
of
his
words
morning
said
he
they
will
pass
opposite
the
bridge
of
mordioux
that
is
clear
enough
and
particularly
for
a
lover
that
is
the
cause
of
this
embarrassment
that
is
the
cause
of
this
hesitation
that
is
the
cause
of
this
order
monsieur
the
lieutenant
of
my
musketeers
be
on
horseback
at
four
o
clock
in
the
which
is
as
clear
as
if
he
had
said
monsieur
the
lieutenant
of
my
musketeers
at
four
at
the
bridge
of
blois
do
you
understand
here
is
a
state
secret
then
which
i
humble
as
i
am
have
in
my
possession
while
it
is
in
action
and
how
do
i
get
it
because
i
have
good
eyes
as
his
majesty
just
now
said
they
say
he
loves
this
little
italian
doll
furiously
they
say
he
threw
himself
at
his
mother
s
feet
to
beg
her
to
allow
him
to
marry
her
they
say
the
queen
went
so
far
as
to
consult
the
court
of
rome
whether
such
a
marriage
contracted
against
her
will
would
be
valid
oh
if
i
were
but
if
i
had
by
my
side
those
i
no
longer
have
if
i
did
not
despise
the
whole
world
most
profoundly
i
would
embroil
mazarin
with
the
france
with
spain
and
i
would
make
a
queen
after
my
own
fashion
but
let
that
pass
and
the
lieutenant
snapped
his
fingers
in
disdain
this
miserable
italian
this
poor
creature
this
sordid
wretch
who
has
just
refused
the
king
of
england
a
million
would
not
perhaps
give
me
a
thousand
pistoles
for
the
news
i
would
carry
him
mordioux
i
am
falling
into
second
childhood
i
am
becoming
stupid
indeed
the
idea
of
mazarin
giving
anything
ha
ha
ha
and
he
laughed
in
a
subdued
voice
well
let
us
go
to
sleep
let
us
go
to
sleep
and
the
sooner
the
better
my
mind
is
wearied
with
my
evening
s
work
and
will
see
things
more
clearly
than
and
upon
this
recommendation
made
to
himself
he
folded
his
cloak
around
him
looking
with
contempt
upon
his
royal
neighbor
five
minutes
after
this
he
was
asleep
with
his
hands
clenched
and
his
lips
apart
giving
escape
not
to
his
secret
but
to
a
sonorous
sound
which
rose
and
spread
freely
beneath
the
majestic
roof
of
the
chapter
xiii
mary
de
mancini
the
sun
had
scarcely
shed
its
first
beams
on
the
majestic
trees
of
the
park
and
the
lofty
turrets
of
the
castle
when
the
young
king
who
had
been
awake
more
than
two
hours
possessed
by
the
sleeplessness
of
love
opened
his
shutters
himself
and
cast
an
inquiring
look
into
the
courts
of
the
sleeping
palace
he
saw
that
it
was
the
hour
agreed
upon
the
great
court
clock
pointed
to
a
quarter
past
four
he
did
not
disturb
his
valet
de
chambre
who
was
sleeping
soundly
at
some
distance
he
dressed
himself
and
the
valet
in
a
great
fright
sprang
up
thinking
he
had
been
deficient
in
his
duty
but
the
king
sent
him
back
again
commanding
him
to
preserve
the
most
absolute
silence
he
then
descended
the
little
staircase
went
out
at
a
lateral
door
and
perceived
at
the
end
of
the
wall
a
mounted
horseman
holding
another
horse
by
the
bridle
this
horseman
could
not
be
recognized
in
his
cloak
and
slouched
hat
as
to
the
horse
saddled
like
that
of
a
rich
citizen
it
offered
nothing
remarkable
to
the
most
experienced
eye
louis
took
the
bridle
the
officer
held
the
stirrup
without
dismounting
and
asked
his
majesty
s
orders
in
a
low
voice
follow
me
replied
the
king
the
officer
put
his
horse
to
the
trot
behind
that
of
his
master
and
they
descended
the
hill
towards
the
bridge
when
they
reached
the
other
side
of
the
loire
monsieur
said
the
king
you
will
please
to
ride
on
till
you
see
a
carriage
coming
then
return
and
inform
me
i
will
wait
here
will
your
majesty
deign
to
give
me
some
description
of
the
carriage
i
am
charged
to
discover
a
carriage
in
which
you
will
see
two
ladies
and
probably
their
attendants
likewise
sire
i
should
not
wish
to
make
a
mistake
is
there
no
other
sign
by
which
i
may
know
this
carriage
it
will
bear
in
all
probability
the
arms
of
monsieur
le
cardinal
that
is
sufficient
sire
replied
the
officer
fully
instructed
in
the
object
of
his
search
he
put
his
horse
to
the
trot
and
rode
sharply
on
in
the
direction
pointed
out
by
the
king
but
he
had
scarcely
gone
five
hundred
paces
when
he
saw
four
mules
and
then
a
carriage
loom
up
from
behind
a
little
hill
behind
this
carriage
came
another
it
required
only
one
glance
to
assure
him
that
these
were
the
equipages
he
was
in
search
of
he
therefore
turned
his
bridle
and
rode
back
to
the
king
sire
said
he
here
are
the
carriages
the
first
as
you
said
contains
two
ladies
with
their
femmes
de
chambre
the
second
contains
the
footmen
provisions
and
necessaries
that
is
well
replied
the
king
in
an
agitated
voice
please
to
go
and
tell
those
ladies
that
a
cavalier
of
the
court
wishes
to
pay
his
respects
to
them
alone
the
officer
set
off
at
a
gallop
mordioux
said
he
as
he
rode
on
here
is
a
new
and
honorable
employment
i
hope
i
complained
of
being
nobody
i
am
the
king
s
confidant
that
is
enough
to
make
a
musketeer
burst
with
pride
he
approached
the
carriage
and
delivered
his
message
gallantly
and
intelligently
there
were
two
ladies
in
the
carriage
one
of
great
beauty
although
rather
thin
the
other
less
favored
by
nature
but
lively
graceful
and
uniting
in
the
delicate
lines
of
her
brow
all
the
signs
of
a
strong
will
her
eyes
animated
and
piercing
in
particular
spoke
more
eloquently
than
all
the
amorous
phrases
in
fashion
in
those
days
of
gallantry
it
was
to
her
d
artagnan
addressed
himself
without
fear
of
being
mistaken
although
the
other
was
as
we
have
said
the
more
handsome
of
the
two
madame
said
he
i
am
the
lieutenant
of
the
musketeers
and
there
is
on
the
road
a
horseman
who
awaits
you
and
is
desirous
of
paying
his
respects
to
you
at
these
words
the
effect
of
which
he
watched
closely
the
lady
with
the
black
eyes
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
leant
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
seeing
the
cavalier
approaching
held
out
her
arms
exclaiming
ah
my
dear
sire
and
the
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
the
coachman
stopped
his
team
the
women
rose
in
confusion
from
the
back
of
the
carriage
and
the
second
lady
made
a
slight
curtsey
terminated
by
the
most
ironical
smile
that
jealousy
ever
imparted
to
the
lips
of
woman
marie
dear
marie
cried
the
king
taking
the
hand
of
the
lady
in
both
his
and
opening
the
heavy
door
himself
he
drew
her
out
of
the
carriage
with
so
much
ardor
that
she
was
in
his
arms
before
she
touched
the
ground
the
lieutenant
posted
on
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
saw
and
heard
all
without
being
observed
the
king
offered
his
arm
to
mademoiselle
de
mancini
and
made
a
sign
to
the
coachman
and
lackeys
to
proceed
it
was
nearly
six
o
clock
the
road
was
fresh
and
pleasant
tall
trees
with
their
foliage
still
inclosed
in
the
golden
down
of
their
buds
let
the
dew
of
morning
filter
from
their
trembling
branches
like
liquid
diamonds
the
grass
was
bursting
at
the
foot
of
the
hedges
the
swallows
having
returned
only
a
few
days
since
described
their
graceful
curves
between
the
heavens
and
the
water
a
breeze
laden
with
the
perfumes
of
the
blossoming
woods
sighed
along
the
road
and
wrinkled
the
surface
of
the
waters
of
the
river
all
these
beauties
of
the
day
all
these
perfumes
of
the
plants
all
these
aspirations
of
the
earth
towards
heaven
intoxicated
the
two
lovers
walking
side
by
side
leaning
upon
each
other
eyes
fixed
upon
eyes
hand
clasping
hand
and
who
lingering
as
by
a
common
desire
did
not
dare
to
speak
they
had
so
much
to
say
the
officer
saw
that
the
king
s
horse
in
wandering
this
way
and
that
annoyed
mademoiselle
de
mancini
he
took
advantage
of
the
pretext
of
securing
the
horse
to
draw
near
them
and
dismounting
walked
between
the
two
horses
he
led
he
did
not
lose
a
single
word
or
gesture
of
the
lovers
it
was
mademoiselle
de
mancini
who
at
length
began
ah
my
dear
sire
said
she
you
do
not
abandon
me
then
no
marie
replied
the
king
you
see
i
do
not
i
had
so
often
been
told
though
that
as
soon
as
we
should
be
separated
you
would
no
longer
think
of
me
dear
marie
is
it
then
only
that
you
have
discovered
we
are
surrounded
by
people
interested
in
deceiving
us
but
then
sire
this
journey
this
alliance
with
spain
they
are
going
to
marry
you
off
louis
hung
his
head
at
the
same
time
the
officer
could
see
the
eyes
of
marie
de
mancini
shine
in
the
sun
with
the
brilliancy
of
a
dagger
starting
from
its
sheath
and
you
have
done
nothing
in
favor
of
our
love
asked
the
girl
after
a
silence
of
a
moment
ah
mademoiselle
how
could
you
believe
that
i
threw
myself
at
the
feet
of
my
mother
i
begged
her
i
implored
her
i
told
her
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
were
in
you
i
even
threatened
well
asked
marie
eagerly
well
the
wrote
to
the
court
of
rome
and
received
as
answer
that
a
marriage
between
us
would
have
no
validity
and
would
be
dissolved
by
the
holy
father
at
length
finding
there
was
no
hope
for
us
i
requested
to
have
my
marriage
with
the
infanta
at
least
delayed
and
yet
that
does
not
prevent
your
being
on
the
road
to
meet
her
how
can
i
help
it
to
my
prayers
to
my
supplications
to
my
tears
i
received
no
answer
but
reasons
of
state
well
well
well
what
is
to
be
done
mademoiselle
when
so
many
wills
are
leagued
against
me
it
was
now
marie
s
turn
to
hang
her
head
then
i
must
bid
you
adieu
forever
said
she
you
know
that
i
am
being
exiled
you
know
that
i
am
going
to
be
buried
alive
you
know
still
more
that
they
want
to
marry
me
off
too
louis
became
very
pale
and
placed
his
hand
upon
his
heart
if
i
had
thought
that
my
life
only
had
been
at
stake
i
have
been
so
persecuted
that
i
might
have
yielded
but
i
thought
yours
was
concerned
my
dear
sire
and
i
stood
out
for
the
sake
of
preserving
your
happiness
oh
yes
my
happiness
my
treasure
murmured
the
king
more
gallantly
than
passionately
perhaps
the
cardinal
might
have
yielded
said
marie
if
you
had
addressed
yourself
to
him
if
you
had
pressed
him
for
the
cardinal
to
call
the
king
of
france
his
nephew
do
you
not
perceive
sire
he
would
have
made
war
even
for
that
honor
the
cardinal
assured
of
governing
alone
under
the
double
pretext
of
having
brought
up
the
king
and
given
his
niece
to
him
in
marriage
the
cardinal
would
have
fought
all
antagonists
overcome
all
obstacles
oh
sire
i
can
answer
for
that
i
am
a
woman
and
i
see
clearly
into
everything
where
love
is
concerned
these
words
produced
a
strange
effect
upon
the
king
instead
of
heightening
his
passion
they
cooled
it
he
stopped
and
said
hastily
what
is
to
be
said
mademoiselle
everything
has
failed
except
your
will
i
trust
my
dear
sire
alas
said
the
king
coloring
have
i
a
will
oh
said
mademoiselle
de
mancini
mournfully
wounded
by
that
expression
the
king
has
no
will
but
that
which
policy
dictates
but
that
which
reasons
of
state
impose
upon
him
oh
it
is
because
you
have
no
love
cried
mary
if
you
loved
sire
you
would
have
a
will
on
pronouncing
these
words
mary
raised
her
eyes
to
her
lover
whom
she
saw
more
pale
and
more
cast
down
than
an
exile
who
is
about
to
quit
his
native
land
forever
accuse
me
murmured
the
king
but
do
not
say
i
do
not
love
you
a
long
silence
followed
these
words
which
the
young
king
had
pronounced
with
a
perfectly
true
and
profound
feeling
i
am
unable
to
think
that
and
after
i
shall
see
you
no
more
i
can
not
think
that
i
am
going
to
end
my
sad
days
at
a
distance
from
paris
that
the
lips
of
an
old
man
of
an
unknown
should
touch
that
hand
which
you
hold
within
yours
no
in
truth
i
can
not
think
of
all
that
my
dear
sire
without
having
my
poor
heart
burst
with
despair
and
marie
de
mancini
did
shed
floods
of
tears
on
his
part
the
king
much
affected
carried
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
and
stifled
a
sob
see
said
she
the
carriages
have
stopped
my
sister
waits
for
me
the
time
is
come
what
you
are
about
to
decide
upon
will
be
decided
for
life
oh
sire
you
are
willing
then
that
i
should
lose
you
you
are
willing
then
louis
that
she
to
whom
you
have
said
i
love
you
should
belong
to
another
than
to
her
king
to
her
master
to
her
lover
oh
courage
louis
courage
one
word
a
single
word
say
i
will
and
all
my
life
is
enchained
to
yours
and
all
my
heart
is
yours
forever
the
king
made
no
reply
mary
then
looked
at
him
as
dido
looked
at
aeneas
in
the
elysian
fields
fierce
and
disdainful
farewell
then
said
she
farewell
life
love
heaven
and
she
took
a
step
away
the
king
detained
her
seizing
her
hand
which
he
pressed
to
his
lips
and
despair
prevailing
over
the
resolution
he
appeared
to
have
inwardly
formed
he
let
fall
upon
that
beautiful
hand
a
burning
tear
of
regret
which
made
mary
start
so
really
had
that
tear
burnt
her
she
saw
the
humid
eyes
of
the
king
his
pale
brow
his
convulsed
lips
and
cried
with
an
accent
that
can
not
be
described
oh
sire
you
are
a
king
you
weep
and
yet
i
depart
as
his
sole
reply
the
king
hid
his
face
in
his
handkerchief
the
officer
uttered
something
so
like
a
roar
that
it
frightened
the
horses
mademoiselle
de
mancini
quite
indignant
quitted
the
king
s
arm
hastily
entered
the
carriage
crying
to
the
coachman
go
on
go
on
and
quick
the
coachman
obeyed
flogging
his
mules
and
the
heavy
carriage
rocked
upon
its
creaking
axle
whilst
the
king
of
france
alone
cast
down
annihilated
did
not
dare
to
look
either
behind
or
before
him
chapter
xiv
in
which
the
king
and
the
lieutenant
each
give
proofs
of
memory
when
the
king
like
all
the
people
in
the
world
who
are
in
love
had
long
and
attentively
watched
disappear
in
the
distance
the
carriage
which
bore
away
his
mistress
when
he
had
turned
and
turned
again
a
hundred
times
to
the
same
side
and
had
at
length
succeeded
in
somewhat
calming
the
agitation
of
his
heart
and
thoughts
he
recollected
that
he
was
not
alone
the
officer
still
held
the
horse
by
the
bridle
and
had
not
lost
all
hope
of
seeing
the
king
recover
his
resolution
he
had
still
the
resource
of
mounting
and
riding
after
the
carriage
they
would
have
lost
nothing
by
waiting
a
little
but
the
imagination
of
the
lieutenant
of
the
musketeers
was
too
rich
and
too
brilliant
it
left
far
behind
it
that
of
the
king
who
took
care
not
to
allow
himself
to
be
carried
away
to
such
excess
he
contented
himself
with
approaching
the
officer
and
in
a
doleful
voice
come
said
he
let
us
be
gone
all
is
ended
to
horse
the
officer
imitated
this
carriage
this
slowness
this
sadness
and
leisurely
mounted
his
horse
the
king
pushed
on
sharply
the
lieutenant
followed
him
at
the
bridge
louis
turned
around
for
the
last
time
the
lieutenant
patient
as
a
god
who
has
eternity
behind
and
before
him
still
hoped
for
a
return
of
energy
but
it
was
groundless
nothing
appeared
louis
gained
the
street
which
led
to
the
castle
and
entered
as
seven
was
striking
when
the
king
had
returned
and
the
musketeer
who
saw
everything
had
seen
a
corner
of
the
tapestry
over
the
cardinal
s
window
lifted
up
he
breathed
a
profound
sigh
like
a
man
unloosed
from
the
tightest
bonds
and
said
in
a
low
voice
now
then
my
officer
i
hope
that
it
is
over
the
king
summoned
his
gentleman
please
to
understand
i
shall
receive
nobody
before
two
o
clock
said
he
sire
replied
the
gentleman
there
is
however
some
one
who
requests
admittance
who
is
that
your
lieutenant
of
musketeers
he
who
accompanied
me
yes
sire
ah
said
the
king
let
him
come
in
the
officer
entered
the
king
made
a
sign
and
the
gentleman
and
the
valet
retired
louis
followed
them
with
his
eyes
until
they
had
shut
the
door
and
when
the
tapestries
had
fallen
behind
them
you
remind
me
by
your
presence
monsieur
of
something
i
had
forgotten
to
recommend
to
you
that
is
to
say
the
most
absolute
discretion
oh
sire
why
does
your
majesty
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
making
me
such
a
recommendation
it
is
plain
you
do
not
know
me
yes
monsieur
that
is
true
i
know
that
you
are
discreet
but
as
i
had
prescribed
nothing
the
officer
bowed
has
your
majesty
nothing
else
to
say
to
me
no
monsieur
you
may
retire
shall
i
obtain
permission
not
to
do
so
till
i
have
spoken
to
the
king
sire
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
me
explain
yourself
monsieur
sire
a
thing
without
importance
to
you
but
which
interests
me
greatly
pardon
me
then
for
speaking
of
it
without
urgency
without
necessity
i
never
would
have
done
it
and
i
would
have
disappeared
mute
and
insignificant
as
i
always
have
been
how
disappeared
i
do
not
understand
you
monsieur
sire
in
a
word
said
the
officer
i
am
come
to
ask
for
my
discharge
from
your
majesty
s
service
the
king
made
a
movement
of
surprise
but
the
officer
remained
as
motionless
as
a
statue
your
discharge
yours
monsieur
and
for
how
long
a
time
i
pray
why
forever
sire
what
you
are
desirous
of
quitting
my
service
monsieur
said
louis
with
an
expression
that
revealed
something
more
than
surprise
sire
i
regret
to
say
that
i
am
impossible
it
is
so
however
sire
i
am
getting
old
i
have
worn
harness
now
years
my
poor
shoulders
are
tired
i
feel
that
i
must
give
place
to
the
young
i
don
t
belong
to
this
age
i
have
still
one
foot
in
the
old
one
it
results
that
everything
is
strange
in
my
eyes
everything
astonishes
and
bewilders
me
in
short
i
have
the
honor
to
ask
your
majesty
for
my
discharge
monsieur
said
the
king
looking
at
the
officer
who
wore
his
uniform
with
an
ease
that
would
have
caused
envy
in
a
young
man
you
are
stronger
and
more
vigorous
than
i
am
oh
replied
the
officer
with
an
air
of
false
modesty
your
majesty
says
so
because
i
still
have
a
good
eye
and
a
tolerably
firm
foot
because
i
can
still
ride
a
horse
and
my
mustache
is
black
but
sire
vanity
of
vanities
all
that
illusions
all
that
appearance
smoke
sire
i
have
still
a
youthful
air
it
is
true
but
i
feel
old
and
within
six
months
i
am
certain
i
shall
be
broken
down
gouty
impotent
therefore
then
sire
monsieur
interrupted
the
king
remember
your
words
of
yesterday
you
said
to
me
in
this
very
place
where
you
now
are
that
you
were
endowed
with
the
best
health
of
any
man
in
france
that
fatigue
was
unknown
to
you
that
you
did
not
mind
spending
whole
days
and
nights
at
your
post
did
you
tell
me
that
monsieur
or
not
try
and
recall
monsieur
the
officer
sighed
sire
said
he
old
age
is
boastful
and
it
is
pardonable
for
old
men
to
praise
themselves
when
others
no
longer
do
it
it
is
very
possible
i
said
that
but
the
fact
is
sire
i
am
very
much
fatigued
an
request
permission
to
retire
monsieur
said
the
king
advancing
towards
the
officer
with
a
gesture
full
of
majesty
you
are
not
assigning
me
the
true
reason
you
wish
to
quit
my
service
it
may
be
true
but
you
disguise
from
me
the
motive
of
your
retreat
sire
believe
that
i
believe
what
i
see
monsieur
i
see
a
vigorous
energetic
man
full
of
presence
of
mind
the
best
soldier
in
france
perhaps
and
this
personage
can
not
persuade
me
the
least
in
the
world
that
he
stands
in
need
of
rest
ah
sire
said
the
lieutenant
with
bitterness
what
praise
indeed
your
majesty
confounds
me
energetic
vigorous
brave
intelligent
the
best
soldier
in
the
army
but
sire
your
majesty
exaggerates
my
small
portion
of
merit
to
such
a
point
that
however
good
an
opinion
i
may
have
of
myself
i
do
not
recognize
myself
in
truth
i
do
not
if
i
were
vain
enough
to
believe
only
half
of
your
majesty
s
words
i
should
consider
myself
a
valuable
indispensable
man
i
should
say
that
a
servant
possessed
of
such
brilliant
qualities
was
a
treasure
beyond
all
price
now
sire
i
have
been
all
my
life
i
feel
bound
to
say
it
except
at
the
present
time
appreciated
in
my
opinion
much
below
my
value
i
therefore
repeat
your
majesty
exaggerates
the
king
knitted
his
brow
for
he
saw
a
bitter
raillery
beneath
the
words
of
the
officer
come
monsieur
said
he
let
us
meet
the
question
frankly
are
you
dissatisfied
with
my
service
say
no
evasions
speak
boldly
frankly
i
command
you
to
do
so
the
officer
who
had
been
twisting
his
hat
about
in
his
hands
with
an
embarrassed
air
for
several
minutes
raised
his
head
at
these
words
oh
sire
said
he
that
puts
me
a
little
more
at
my
ease
to
a
question
put
so
frankly
i
will
reply
frankly
to
tell
the
truth
is
a
good
thing
as
much
from
the
pleasure
one
feels
in
relieving
one
s
heart
as
on
account
of
the
rarity
of
the
fact
i
will
speak
the
truth
then
to
my
king
at
the
same
time
imploring
him
to
excuse
the
frankness
of
an
old
soldier
louis
looked
at
his
officer
with
anxiety
which
he
manifested
by
the
agitation
of
his
gesture
well
then
speak
said
he
for
i
am
impatient
to
hear
the
truths
you
have
to
tell
me
the
officer
threw
his
hat
upon
a
table
and
his
countenance
always
so
intelligent
and
martial
assumed
all
at
once
a
strange
character
of
grandeur
and
solemnity
sire
said
he
i
quit
the
king
s
service
because
i
am
dissatisfied
the
valet
in
these
times
can
approach
his
master
as
respectfully
as
i
do
can
give
him
an
account
of
his
labor
bring
back
his
tools
return
the
funds
that
have
been
intrusted
to
him
and
say
master
my
day
s
work
is
done
pay
me
if
you
please
and
let
us
monsieur
monsieur
exclaimed
the
king
crimson
with
rage
ah
sire
replied
the
officer
bending
his
knee
for
a
moment
never
was
servant
more
respectful
than
i
am
before
your
majesty
only
you
commanded
me
to
tell
the
truth
now
i
have
begun
to
tell
it
it
must
come
out
even
if
you
command
me
to
hold
my
tongue
there
was
so
much
resolution
expressed
in
the
muscles
of
the
officer
s
countenance
that
louis
xiv
had
no
occasion
to
tell
him
to
continue
he
continued
therefore
whilst
the
king
looked
at
him
with
a
curiosity
mingled
with
admiration
sire
i
have
as
i
have
said
now
served
the
house
of
france
years
few
people
have
worn
out
so
many
swords
in
that
service
as
i
have
and
the
swords
i
speak
of
were
good
swords
too
sire
i
was
a
boy
ignorant
of
everything
except
courage
when
the
king
your
father
guessed
that
there
was
a
man
in
me
i
was
a
man
sire
when
the
cardinal
de
richelieu
who
was
a
judge
of
manhood
discovered
an
enemy
in
me
sire
the
history
of
that
enmity
between
the
ant
and
the
lion
may
be
read
from
the
first
to
the
last
line
in
the
secret
archives
of
your
family
if
ever
you
feel
an
inclination
to
know
it
do
so
sire
the
history
is
worth
the
trouble
it
is
i
who
tell
you
so
you
will
there
read
that
the
lion
fatigued
harassed
out
of
breath
at
length
cried
for
quarter
and
the
justice
must
be
rendered
him
to
say
that
he
gave
as
much
as
he
required
oh
those
were
glorious
times
sire
strewed
over
with
battles
like
one
of
tasso
s
or
ariosto
s
epics
the
wonders
of
those
times
to
which
the
people
of
ours
would
refuse
belief
were
occurrences
for
five
years
together
i
was
a
hero
every
day
at
least
so
i
was
told
by
persons
of
judgment
and
that
is
a
long
period
for
heroism
trust
me
sire
a
period
of
five
years
nevertheless
i
have
faith
in
what
these
people
told
me
for
the
were
good
judges
they
were
named
de
richelieu
de
buckingham
de
beaufort
de
retz
a
mighty
genius
himself
in
street
warfare
in
short
the
king
louis
and
even
the
queen
your
noble
mother
who
one
day
condescended
to
say
thank
i
don
t
know
what
service
i
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
render
her
pardon
me
sire
for
speaking
so
boldly
but
what
i
relate
to
you
as
i
have
already
had
the
honor
to
tell
your
majesty
is
history
the
king
bit
his
lips
and
threw
himself
violently
on
a
chair
i
appear
importunate
to
your
majesty
said
the
lieutenant
eh
sire
that
is
the
fate
of
truth
she
is
a
stern
companion
she
bristles
all
over
with
steel
she
wounds
those
whom
she
attacks
and
sometimes
him
who
speaks
her
no
monsieur
replied
the
king
i
bade
you
speak
speak
then
after
the
service
of
the
king
and
the
cardinal
came
the
service
of
the
regency
sire
i
fought
pretty
well
in
the
fronde
much
less
though
than
the
first
time
the
men
began
to
diminish
in
stature
i
have
nevertheless
led
your
majesty
s
musketeers
on
some
perilous
occasions
which
stand
upon
the
orders
of
the
day
of
the
company
mine
was
a
beautiful
luck
at
that
time
i
was
the
favorite
of
de
mazarin
lieutenant
here
lieutenant
there
lieutenant
to
the
right
lieutenant
to
the
left
there
was
not
a
buffet
dealt
in
france
of
which
your
humble
servant
did
not
have
the
dealing
but
soon
france
was
not
enough
the
cardinal
sent
me
to
england
on
cromwell
s
account
another
gentleman
who
was
not
over
gentle
i
assure
you
sire
i
had
the
honor
of
knowing
him
and
i
was
well
able
to
appreciate
him
a
great
deal
was
promised
me
on
account
of
that
mission
so
as
i
did
much
more
than
i
had
been
bidden
to
do
i
was
generously
paid
for
i
was
at
length
appointed
captain
of
the
musketeers
that
is
to
say
the
most
envied
position
in
court
which
takes
precedence
over
the
marshals
of
france
and
justly
for
who
says
captain
of
the
musketeers
says
the
flower
of
chivalry
and
king
of
the
brave
captain
monsieur
interrupted
the
king
you
make
a
mistake
lieutenant
you
mean
not
at
all
sire
i
make
no
mistake
your
majesty
may
rely
upon
me
in
that
respect
monsieur
le
cardinal
gave
me
the
commission
himself
well
but
de
mazarin
as
you
know
better
than
anybody
does
not
often
give
and
sometimes
takes
back
what
he
has
given
he
took
it
back
again
as
soon
as
peace
was
made
and
he
was
no
longer
in
want
of
me
certainly
i
was
not
worthy
to
replace
de
treville
of
illustrious
memory
but
they
had
promised
me
and
they
had
given
me
they
ought
to
have
stopped
there
is
that
what
dissatisfies
you
monsieur
well
i
shall
make
inquiries
i
love
justice
and
your
claim
though
made
in
military
fashion
does
not
displease
me
oh
sire
said
the
officer
your
majesty
has
ill
understood
me
i
no
longer
claim
anything
now
excess
of
delicacy
monsieur
but
i
will
keep
my
eye
upon
your
affairs
and
later
oh
sire
what
a
word
later
thirty
years
have
i
lived
upon
that
promising
word
which
has
been
pronounced
by
so
many
great
personages
and
which
your
mouth
has
in
its
turn
just
pronounced
later
that
is
how
i
have
received
a
score
of
wounds
and
how
i
have
reached
years
of
age
without
ever
having
had
a
louis
in
my
purse
and
without
ever
having
met
with
a
protector
on
my
way
i
who
have
protected
so
many
people
so
i
change
my
formula
sire
and
when
any
one
says
to
me
later
i
reply
it
is
rest
that
i
solicit
sire
that
may
be
easily
granted
me
that
will
cost
nobody
anything
i
did
not
look
for
this
language
monsieur
particularly
from
a
man
who
has
always
lived
among
the
great
you
forget
you
are
speaking
to
the
king
to
a
gentleman
who
is
i
suppose
as
of
good
a
house
as
yourself
and
when
i
say
later
i
mean
a
certainty
i
do
not
at
all
doubt
it
sire
but
this
is
the
end
of
the
terrible
truth
i
had
to
tell
you
if
i
were
to
see
upon
that
table
a
marshal
s
stick
the
sword
of
constable
the
crown
of
poland
instead
of
later
i
swear
to
you
sire
that
i
should
still
say
now
oh
excuse
me
sire
i
am
from
the
country
of
your
grandfather
henry
iv
i
do
not
speak
often
but
when
i
do
speak
i
speak
all
the
future
of
my
reign
has
little
temptation
for
you
monsieur
it
appears
said
louis
haughtily
forgetfulness
forgetfulness
everywhere
cried
the
officer
with
a
noble
air
the
master
has
forgotten
the
servant
so
the
servant
is
reduced
to
forget
his
master
i
live
in
unfortunate
times
sire
i
see
youth
full
of
discouragement
and
fear
i
see
it
timid
and
despoiled
when
it
ought
to
be
rich
and
powerful
i
yesterday
evening
for
example
open
the
door
to
a
king
of
england
whose
father
humble
as
i
am
i
was
near
saving
if
god
had
not
been
against
me
god
who
inspired
his
elect
cromwell
i
open
i
said
the
door
that
is
to
say
the
palace
of
one
brother
to
another
brother
and
i
see
stop
sire
that
is
a
load
on
my
heart
i
see
the
minister
of
that
king
drive
away
the
proscribed
prince
and
humiliate
his
master
by
condemning
to
want
another
king
his
equal
then
i
see
my
prince
who
is
young
handsome
and
brave
who
has
courage
in
his
heart
and
lightening
in
his
eye
i
see
him
tremble
before
a
priest
who
laughs
at
him
behind
the
curtain
of
his
alcove
where
he
digests
all
the
gold
of
france
which
he
afterwards
stuffs
into
secret
coffers
yes
i
understand
your
looks
sire
i
am
bold
to
madness
but
what
is
to
be
said
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
tell
you
here
sire
to
you
my
king
things
which
i
would
cram
down
the
throat
of
any
one
who
should
dare
to
pronounce
them
before
me
you
have
commanded
me
to
pour
out
the
bottom
of
my
heart
before
you
sire
and
i
cast
at
the
feet
of
your
majesty
the
indignation
of
thirty
years
as
i
would
pour
out
all
my
blood
if
your
majesty
commanded
me
to
do
so
the
king
without
speaking
a
word
wiped
the
drops
of
cold
and
abundant
perspiration
which
trickled
from
his
temples
the
moment
of
silence
which
followed
this
vehement
outbreak
represented
for
him
who
had
spoken
and
for
him
who
had
listened
ages
of
suffering
monsieur
said
the
king
at
length
you
spoke
the
word
forgetfulness
i
have
heard
nothing
but
that
word
i
will
reply
then
to
it
alone
others
have
perhaps
been
able
to
forget
but
i
have
not
and
the
proof
is
that
i
remember
that
one
day
of
riot
that
one
day
when
the
furious
people
raging
and
roaring
as
the
sea
invaded
the
royal
palace
that
one
day
when
i
feigned
sleep
in
my
bed
one
man
alone
naked
sword
in
hand
concealed
behind
my
curtain
watched
over
my
life
ready
to
risk
his
own
for
me
as
he
had
before
risked
it
twenty
times
for
the
lives
of
my
family
was
not
the
gentleman
whose
name
i
then
demanded
called
d
artagnan
say
monsieur
your
majesty
has
a
good
memory
replied
the
officer
coldly
you
see
then
continued
the
king
if
i
have
such
remembrances
of
my
childhood
what
an
amount
i
may
gather
in
the
age
of
reason
your
majesty
has
been
richly
endowed
by
god
said
the
officer
in
the
same
tone
come
monsieur
d
artagnan
continued
louis
with
feverish
agitation
ought
you
not
to
be
patient
as
i
am
ought
you
not
to
do
as
i
do
come
and
what
do
you
do
sire
i
wait
your
majesty
may
do
so
because
you
are
young
but
i
sire
have
not
time
to
wait
old
age
is
at
my
door
and
death
is
behind
it
looking
into
the
very
depths
of
my
house
your
majesty
is
beginning
life
its
future
is
full
of
hope
and
fortune
but
i
sire
i
am
on
the
other
side
of
the
horizon
and
we
are
so
far
from
each
other
that
i
should
never
have
time
to
wait
till
your
majesty
came
up
to
me
louis
made
another
turn
in
his
apartment
still
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
brow
in
a
manner
that
would
have
terrified
his
physicians
if
his
physicians
had
witnessed
the
state
his
majesty
was
in
it
is
very
well
monsieur
said
louis
in
a
sharp
voice
you
are
desirous
of
having
your
discharge
and
you
shall
have
it
you
offer
me
your
resignation
of
the
rank
of
lieutenant
of
the
musketeers
i
deposit
it
humbly
at
your
majesty
s
feet
sire
that
is
sufficient
i
will
order
your
pension
i
shall
have
a
thousand
obligations
to
your
majesty
monsieur
said
the
king
with
a
violent
effort
i
think
you
are
losing
a
good
master
and
i
am
sure
of
it
sire
shall
you
ever
find
such
another
oh
sire
i
know
that
your
majesty
is
alone
in
the
world
therefore
will
i
never
again
take
service
with
any
other
king
upon
earth
and
will
never
again
have
other
master
than
myself
you
say
so
i
swear
so
your
majesty
i
shall
remember
that
word
monsieur
d
artagnan
bowed
and
you
know
i
have
a
good
memory
said
the
king
yes
sire
and
yet
i
should
desire
that
that
memory
should
fail
your
majesty
in
this
instance
in
order
that
you
might
forget
all
the
miseries
i
have
been
forced
to
spread
before
your
eyes
your
majesty
is
so
much
above
the
poor
and
the
mean
that
i
hope
my
majesty
monsieur
will
act
like
the
sun
which
looks
upon
all
great
and
small
rich
and
poor
giving
luster
to
some
warmth
to
others
and
life
to
all
adieu
monsieur
d
artagnan
adieu
you
are
free
and
the
king
with
a
hoarse
sob
which
was
lost
in
his
throat
passed
quickly
into
the
next
room
d
artagnan
took
up
his
hat
from
the
table
on
which
he
had
thrown
in
and
went
out
chapter
xv
the
proscribed
d
artagnan
had
not
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
when
the
king
called
his
gentleman
i
have
a
commission
to
give
you
monsieur
said
he
i
am
at
your
majesty
s
commands
wait
then
and
the
young
king
began
to
write
the
following
letter
which
cost
him
more
than
one
sigh
although
at
the
same
time
something
like
a
feeling
of
triumph
glittered
in
his
eyes
my
lord
cardinal
thanks
to
your
good
counsels
and
above
all
thanks
to
your
firmness
i
have
succeeded
in
overcoming
a
weakness
unworthy
of
a
king
you
have
too
ably
arranged
my
destiny
to
allow
gratitude
not
to
stop
me
at
the
moment
when
i
was
about
to
destroy
your
work
i
felt
i
was
wrong
to
wish
to
make
my
life
turn
from
the
course
you
had
marked
out
for
it
certainly
it
would
have
been
a
misfortune
to
france
and
my
family
if
a
misunderstanding
had
taken
place
between
me
and
my
minister
this
however
would
certainly
have
happened
if
i
had
made
your
niece
my
wife
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
this
and
will
henceforth
oppose
nothing
to
the
accomplishment
of
my
destiny
i
am
prepared
then
to
wed
the
infanta
maria
theresa
you
may
at
once
open
the
your
affectionate
louis
the
king
after
reperusing
the
letter
sealed
it
himself
this
letter
for
my
lord
cardinal
said
he
the
gentleman
took
it
at
mazarin
s
door
he
found
bernouin
waiting
with
anxiety
well
asked
the
minister
s
valet
de
chambre
monsieur
said
the
gentleman
here
is
a
letter
for
his
eminence
a
letter
ah
we
expected
one
after
the
little
journey
of
the
morning
oh
you
know
then
that
his
majesty
as
first
minister
it
belongs
to
the
duties
of
our
charge
to
know
everything
and
his
majesty
prays
and
implores
i
presume
i
don
t
know
but
he
sighed
frequently
whilst
he
was
writing
yes
yes
yes
we
understand
all
that
people
sigh
sometimes
from
happiness
as
well
as
from
grief
monsieur
and
yet
the
king
did
not
look
very
happy
when
he
returned
monsieur
you
did
not
see
clearly
besides
you
only
saw
his
majesty
on
his
return
for
he
was
only
accompanied
by
the
lieutenant
of
the
guards
but
i
had
his
eminence
s
telescope
i
looked
through
it
when
he
was
tired
and
i
am
sure
they
both
wept
well
was
it
for
happiness
they
wept
no
but
for
love
and
they
vowed
to
each
other
a
thousand
tendernesses
which
the
king
asks
no
better
to
keep
now
this
letter
is
a
beginning
of
the
execution
and
what
does
his
eminence
think
of
this
love
which
is
by
the
bye
no
secret
to
anybody
bernouin
took
the
gentleman
by
the
arm
and
whilst
ascending
the
staircase
in
confidence
said
he
in
a
low
voice
his
eminence
looks
for
success
in
the
affair
i
know
very
well
we
shall
have
war
with
spain
but
bah
war
will
please
the
nobles
my
lord
cardinal
besides
can
endow
his
niece
royally
nay
more
than
royally
there
will
be
money
festivities
and
everybody
will
be
delighted
well
for
my
part
replied
the
gentleman
shaking
his
head
it
appears
to
me
that
this
letter
is
very
light
to
contain
all
that
my
friend
replied
bernouin
i
am
certain
of
what
i
tell
you
d
artagnan
related
all
that
passed
to
me
ay
ay
and
what
did
he
tell
you
let
us
hear
i
accosted
him
by
asking
him
on
the
part
of
the
cardinal
if
there
were
any
news
without
discovering
my
designs
observe
for
d
artagnan
is
a
cunning
hand
my
dear
monsieur
bernouin
he
replied
the
king
is
madly
in
love
with
mademoiselle
de
mancini
that
is
all
i
have
to
tell
and
then
i
asked
him
do
you
think
to
such
a
degree
that
it
will
urge
him
to
act
contrary
to
the
designs
of
his
eminence
ah
don
t
ask
me
said
he
i
think
the
king
capable
of
anything
he
has
a
will
of
iron
and
what
he
wills
he
wills
in
earnest
if
he
takes
it
into
his
head
to
marry
mademoiselle
de
mancini
he
will
marry
her
depend
upon
and
thereupon
he
left
me
and
went
straight
to
the
stables
took
a
horse
saddled
it
himself
jumped
upon
its
back
and
set
off
as
if
the
devil
were
at
his
heels
so
that
you
believe
then
i
believe
that
monsieur
the
lieutenant
of
the
guards
knew
more
than
he
was
willing
to
say
in
you
opinion
then
d
artagnan
is
gone
according
to
all
probability
after
the
exiles
to
carry
out
all
that
can
facilitate
the
success
of
the
king
s
love
chatting
thus
the
two
confidants
arrived
at
the
door
of
his
eminence
s
apartment
his
eminence
s
gout
had
left
him
he
was
walking
about
his
chamber
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
listening
at
doors
and
looking
out
of
windows
bernouin
entered
followed
by
the
gentleman
who
had
orders
from
the
king
to
place
the
letter
in
the
hands
of
the
cardinal
himself
mazarin
took
the
letter
but
before
opening
it
he
got
up
a
ready
smile
a
smile
of
circumstance
able
to
throw
a
veil
over
emotions
of
whatever
sort
they
might
be
so
prepared
whatever
was
the
impression
received
from
the
letter
no
reflection
of
that
impression
was
allowed
to
transpire
upon
his
countenance
well
said
he
when
he
had
read
and
reread
the
letter
very
well
monsieur
inform
the
king
that
i
thank
him
for
his
obedience
to
the
wishes
of
the
and
that
i
will
do
everything
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
will
the
gentleman
left
the
room
the
door
had
scarcely
closed
before
the
cardinal
who
had
no
mask
for
bernouin
took
off
that
which
had
so
recently
covered
his
face
and
with
a
most
dismal
expression
call
de
brienne
said
he
five
minutes
afterward
the
secretary
entered
monsieur
said
mazarin
i
have
just
rendered
a
great
service
to
the
monarchy
the
greatest
i
have
ever
rendered
it
you
will
carry
this
letter
which
proves
it
to
her
majesty
the
and
when
she
shall
have
returned
it
to
you
you
will
lodge
it
in
portfolio
which
is
filed
with
documents
and
papers
relative
to
my
ministry
brienne
went
as
desired
and
as
the
letter
was
unsealed
did
not
fail
to
read
it
on
his
way
there
is
likewise
no
doubt
that
bernouin
who
was
on
good
terms
with
everybody
approached
so
near
to
the
secretary
as
to
be
able
to
read
the
letter
over
his
shoulder
so
that
the
news
spread
with
such
activity
through
the
castle
that
mazarin
might
have
feared
it
would
reach
the
ears
of
the
before
de
brienne
could
convey
louis
s
letter
to
her
a
moment
after
orders
were
given
for
departure
and
de
conde
having
been
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
king
on
his
pretended
rising
inscribed
the
city
of
poitiers
upon
his
tablets
as
the
place
of
sojourn
and
rest
for
their
majesties
thus
in
a
few
instants
was
unraveled
an
intrigue
which
had
covertly
occupied
all
the
diplomacies
of
europe
it
had
nothing
however
very
clear
as
a
result
but
to
make
a
poor
lieutenant
of
musketeers
lose
his
commission
and
his
fortune
it
is
true
that
in
exchange
he
gained
his
liberty
we
shall
soon
know
how
d
artagnan
profited
by
this
for
the
moment
if
the
reader
will
permit
us
we
shall
return
to
the
hostelry
of
les
medici
of
which
one
of
the
windows
opened
at
the
very
moment
the
orders
were
given
for
the
departure
of
the
king
the
window
that
opened
was
that
of
one
of
the
rooms
of
charles
ii
the
unfortunate
prince
had
passed
the
night
in
bitter
reflections
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
and
his
elbows
on
the
table
whilst
parry
infirm
and
old
wearied
in
body
and
in
mind
had
fallen
asleep
in
a
corner
a
singular
fortune
was
that
of
this
faithful
servant
who
saw
beginning
for
the
second
generation
the
fearful
series
of
misfortunes
which
had
weighed
so
heavily
on
the
first
when
charles
ii
had
well
thought
over
the
fresh
defeat
he
had
experienced
when
he
perfectly
comprehended
the
complete
isolation
into
which
he
had
just
fallen
on
seeing
his
fresh
hope
left
behind
him
he
was
seized
as
with
a
vertigo
and
sank
back
into
the
large
armchair
in
which
he
was
seated
then
god
took
pity
on
the
unhappy
prince
and
sent
to
console
him
sleep
the
innocent
brother
of
death
he
did
not
wake
till
six
that
is
to
say
till
the
sun
shone
brightly
into
his
chamber
and
parry
motionless
with
fear
of
waking
him
was
observing
with
profound
grief
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
already
red
with
wakefulness
and
his
cheeks
pale
with
suffering
and
privations
at
length
the
noise
of
some
heavy
carts
descending
towards
the
loire
awakened
charles
he
arose
looked
around
him
like
a
man
who
has
forgotten
everything
perceived
parry
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
commanded
him
to
settle
the
reckoning
with
master
cropole
master
cropole
being
called
upon
to
settle
his
account
with
parry
acquitted
himself
it
must
be
allowed
like
an
honest
man
he
only
made
his
customary
remark
that
the
two
travelers
had
eaten
nothing
which
had
the
double
disadvantage
of
being
humiliating
for
his
kitchen
and
of
forcing
him
to
ask
payment
for
a
repast
not
consumed
but
not
the
less
lost
parry
had
nothing
to
say
to
the
contrary
and
paid
i
hope
said
the
king
it
has
not
been
the
same
with
the
horses
i
don
t
see
that
they
have
eaten
at
your
expense
and
it
would
be
a
misfortune
for
travelers
like
us
who
have
a
long
journey
to
make
to
have
our
horses
fail
us
but
cropole
at
this
doubt
assumed
his
majestic
air
and
replied
that
the
stables
of
les
medici
were
not
less
hospitable
than
its
refectory
the
king
mounted
his
horse
his
old
servant
did
the
same
and
both
set
out
towards
paris
without
meeting
a
single
person
on
their
road
in
the
streets
or
the
faubourgs
of
the
city
for
the
prince
the
blow
was
the
more
severe
as
it
was
a
fresh
exile
the
unfortunates
cling
to
the
smallest
hopes
as
the
happy
do
to
the
greatest
good
and
when
they
are
obliged
to
quit
the
place
where
that
hope
has
soothed
their
hearts
they
experience
the
mortal
regret
which
the
banished
man
feels
when
he
places
his
foot
upon
the
vessel
which
is
to
bear
him
into
exile
it
appears
that
the
heart
already
wounded
so
many
times
suffers
from
the
least
scratch
it
appears
that
it
considers
as
a
good
the
momentary
absence
of
evil
which
is
nothing
but
the
absence
of
pain
and
that
god
into
the
most
terrible
misfortunes
has
thrown
hope
as
the
drop
of
water
which
the
rich
sinner
in
hell
entreated
of
lazarus
for
one
instant
even
the
hope
of
charles
ii
had
been
more
than
a
fugitive
joy
that
was
when
he
found
himself
so
kindly
welcomed
by
his
brother
king
then
it
had
taken
a
form
that
had
become
a
reality
then
all
at
once
the
refusal
of
mazarin
had
reduced
the
fictitious
reality
to
the
state
of
a
dream
this
promise
of
louis
so
soon
retracted
had
been
nothing
but
a
mockery
a
mockery
like
his
crown
like
his
scepter
like
his
friends
like
all
that
had
surrounded
his
royal
childhood
and
which
had
abandoned
his
proscribed
youth
mockery
everything
was
a
mockery
for
charles
ii
except
the
cold
black
repose
promised
by
death
such
were
the
ideas
of
the
unfortunate
prince
while
sitting
listlessly
upon
his
horse
to
which
he
abandoned
the
reins
he
rode
slowly
along
beneath
the
warm
may
sun
in
which
the
somber
misanthropy
of
the
exile
perceived
a
last
insult
to
his
grief
chapter
xvi
remember
a
horseman
going
rapidly
along
the
road
leading
towards
blois
which
he
had
left
nearly
half
an
hour
before
passed
the
two
travelers
and
though
apparently
in
haste
raised
his
hat
as
he
passed
them
the
king
scarcely
observed
this
young
man
who
was
about
years
of
age
and
who
turning
round
several
times
made
friendly
signals
to
a
man
standing
before
the
gate
of
a
handsome
house
that
is
to
say
built
of
brick
and
stone
with
a
slated
roof
situated
on
the
left
hand
of
the
road
the
prince
was
traveling
this
man
old
tall
and
thin
with
white
hair
we
speak
of
the
one
standing
by
the
gate
this
man
replied
to
the
farewell
signals
of
the
young
one
by
signs
of
parting
as
tender
as
could
have
been
made
by
a
father
the
young
man
disappeared
at
the
first
turn
of
the
road
bordered
by
fine
trees
and
the
old
man
was
preparing
to
return
to
the
house
when
the
two
travelers
arriving
in
front
of
the
gate
attracted
his
attention
the
king
as
we
have
said
was
riding
with
his
head
cast
down
his
arms
inert
leaving
his
horse
to
go
what
pace
he
liked
whilst
parry
behind
him
the
better
to
imbibe
the
genial
influence
of
the
sun
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
was
looking
about
right
and
left
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
old
man
leaning
against
the
gate
the
latter
as
if
struck
by
some
strange
spectacle
uttered
an
exclamation
and
made
one
step
towards
the
two
travelers
from
parry
his
eyes
immediately
turned
towards
the
king
upon
whom
they
rested
for
an
instant
this
examination
however
rapid
was
instantly
reflected
in
a
visible
manner
upon
the
features
of
the
tall
old
man
for
scarcely
had
he
recognized
the
younger
of
the
travelers
and
we
said
recognized
for
nothing
but
a
perfect
recognition
could
have
explained
such
an
act
scarcely
we
say
had
he
recognized
the
younger
of
the
two
travelers
than
he
clapped
his
hands
together
with
respectful
surprise
and
raising
his
hat
from
his
head
bowed
so
profoundly
that
it
might
have
been
said
he
was
kneeling
this
demonstration
however
absent
or
rather
however
absorbed
was
the
king
in
his
reflections
attracted
his
attention
instantly
and
checking
his
horse
and
turning
towards
parry
he
exclaimed
good
god
parry
who
is
that
man
who
salutes
me
in
such
a
marked
manner
can
he
know
me
think
you
parry
much
agitated
and
very
pale
had
already
turned
his
horse
towards
the
gate
ah
sire
said
he
stopping
suddenly
at
five
or
six
paces
distance
from
the
still
bending
old
man
sire
i
am
seized
with
astonishment
for
i
think
i
recognize
that
brave
man
yes
it
must
be
he
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
speak
to
him
certainly
can
it
be
you
monsieur
grimaud
asked
parry
yes
it
is
i
replied
the
tall
old
man
drawing
himself
up
but
without
losing
his
respectful
demeanor
sire
then
said
parry
i
was
not
deceived
this
good
man
is
the
servant
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
comte
de
la
fere
if
you
remember
is
the
worthy
gentleman
of
whom
i
have
so
often
spoken
to
your
majesty
that
the
remembrance
of
him
must
remain
not
only
in
your
mind
but
in
your
heart
he
who
assisted
my
father
at
his
last
moments
asked
charles
evidently
affected
at
the
remembrance
the
same
sire
alas
said
charles
and
then
addressing
grimaud
whose
penetrating
and
intelligent
eyes
seemed
to
search
and
divine
his
my
friend
said
he
does
your
master
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
live
in
this
neighborhood
there
replied
grimaud
pointing
with
his
outstretched
arm
to
the
house
behind
the
gate
and
is
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
at
home
at
present
at
the
back
under
the
chestnut
trees
parry
said
the
king
i
will
not
miss
this
opportunity
so
precious
for
me
to
thank
the
gentleman
to
whom
our
house
is
indebted
for
such
a
noble
example
of
devotedness
and
generosity
hold
my
horse
my
friend
if
you
please
and
throwing
the
bridle
to
grimaud
the
king
entered
the
abode
of
athos
quite
alone
as
one
equal
enters
the
dwelling
of
another
charles
had
been
informed
by
the
concise
explanation
of
grimaud
at
the
back
under
the
chestnut
trees
he
left
therefore
the
house
on
the
left
and
went
straight
down
the
path
indicated
the
thing
was
easy
the
tops
of
those
noble
trees
already
covered
with
leaves
and
flowers
rose
above
all
the
rest
on
arriving
under
the
lozenges
by
turns
luminous
and
dark
which
checkered
the
ground
of
this
path
according
as
the
trees
were
more
or
less
in
leaf
the
young
prince
perceived
a
gentleman
walking
with
his
arms
behind
him
apparently
plunged
in
a
deep
meditation
without
doubt
he
had
often
had
this
gentleman
described
to
himself
for
without
hesitating
charles
ii
walked
straight
up
to
him
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
the
comte
de
la
fere
raised
his
head
and
seeing
an
unknown
man
of
noble
and
elegant
carriage
coming
towards
him
he
raised
his
hat
and
waited
at
some
paces
from
him
charles
ii
likewise
took
off
his
hat
then
as
if
in
reply
to
the
comte
s
mute
interrogation
monsieur
le
comte
said
he
i
come
to
discharge
a
debt
towards
you
i
have
for
a
long
time
had
the
expression
of
a
profound
gratitude
to
bring
you
i
am
charles
son
of
charles
stuart
who
reigned
in
england
and
died
on
the
scaffold
on
hearing
this
illustrious
name
athos
felt
a
kind
of
shudder
creep
through
his
veins
but
at
the
sight
of
the
young
prince
standing
uncovered
before
him
and
stretching
out
his
hand
towards
him
two
tears
for
an
instant
dimmed
his
brilliant
eyes
he
bent
respectfully
but
the
prince
took
him
by
the
hand
see
how
unfortunate
i
am
my
lord
count
it
is
only
due
to
chance
that
i
have
met
with
you
alas
i
ought
to
have
people
around
me
whom
i
love
and
honor
whereas
i
am
reduced
to
preserve
their
services
in
my
heart
and
their
names
in
my
memory
so
that
if
your
servant
had
not
recognized
mine
i
should
have
passed
by
your
door
as
by
that
of
a
stranger
it
is
but
too
true
said
athos
replying
with
his
voice
to
the
first
part
of
the
king
s
speech
and
with
a
bow
to
the
second
it
is
but
too
true
indeed
that
your
majesty
has
seen
many
evil
days
and
the
worst
alas
replied
charles
are
perhaps
still
to
come
sire
let
us
hope
count
count
continued
charles
shaking
his
head
i
entertained
hope
till
last
night
and
that
of
a
good
christian
i
swear
athos
looked
at
the
king
as
if
to
interrogate
him
oh
the
history
is
soon
related
said
charles
proscribed
despoiled
disdained
i
resolved
in
spite
of
all
my
repugnance
to
tempt
fortune
one
last
time
is
it
not
written
above
that
for
our
family
all
good
fortune
and
all
bad
fortune
shall
eternally
come
from
france
you
know
something
of
that
monsieur
you
who
are
one
of
the
frenchmen
whom
my
unfortunate
father
found
at
the
foot
of
his
scaffold
on
the
day
of
his
death
after
having
found
them
at
his
right
hand
on
the
day
of
battle
sire
said
athos
modestly
i
was
not
alone
my
companions
and
i
did
under
the
circumstances
our
duty
as
gentlemen
and
that
was
all
your
majesty
was
about
to
do
me
the
honor
to
relate
that
is
true
i
had
the
protection
pardon
my
hesitation
count
but
for
a
stuart
you
who
understand
everything
you
will
comprehend
that
the
word
is
hard
to
pronounce
i
had
i
say
the
protection
of
my
cousin
the
stadtholder
of
holland
but
without
the
intervention
or
at
least
without
the
authorization
of
france
the
stadtholder
would
not
take
the
initiative
i
came
then
to
ask
this
authorization
of
the
king
of
france
who
has
refused
me
the
king
has
refused
you
sire
oh
not
he
all
justice
must
be
rendered
to
my
younger
brother
louis
but
monsieur
de
mazarin
athos
bit
his
lips
you
perhaps
think
i
should
have
expected
this
refusal
said
the
king
who
had
noticed
the
movement
that
was
in
truth
my
thought
sire
replied
athos
respectfully
i
know
that
italian
of
old
then
i
determined
to
come
to
the
test
and
know
at
once
the
last
word
of
my
destiny
i
told
my
brother
louis
that
not
to
compromise
either
france
or
holland
i
would
tempt
fortune
myself
in
person
as
i
had
already
done
with
two
hundred
gentlemen
if
he
would
give
them
to
me
and
a
million
if
he
would
lend
it
me
well
sire
well
monsieur
i
am
suffering
at
this
moment
something
strange
and
that
is
the
satisfaction
of
despair
there
is
in
certain
souls
and
i
have
just
discovered
that
mine
is
of
the
number
a
real
satisfaction
in
the
assurance
that
all
is
lost
and
the
time
is
come
to
yield
oh
i
hope
said
athos
that
your
majesty
is
not
come
to
that
extremity
to
say
so
my
lord
count
to
endeavor
to
revive
hope
in
my
heart
you
must
have
ill
understood
what
i
have
just
told
you
i
came
to
blois
to
ask
of
my
brother
louis
the
alms
of
a
million
with
which
i
had
the
hopes
of
my
affairs
and
my
brother
louis
has
refused
me
you
see
then
plainly
that
all
is
lost
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
express
a
contrary
opinion
how
is
that
count
do
you
think
my
heart
of
so
low
an
order
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
face
my
position
sire
i
have
always
seen
that
it
was
in
desperate
positions
that
suddenly
the
great
turns
of
fortune
have
taken
place
thank
you
count
it
is
some
comfort
to
meet
with
a
heart
like
yours
that
is
to
say
sufficiently
trustful
in
god
and
in
monarchy
never
to
despair
of
a
royal
fortune
however
low
it
may
be
fallen
unfortunately
my
dear
count
your
words
are
like
those
remedies
they
call
sovereign
and
which
though
able
to
cure
curable
wounds
or
diseases
fail
against
death
thank
you
for
your
perseverance
in
consoling
me
count
thanks
for
your
devoted
remembrance
but
i
know
in
what
i
must
trust
nothing
will
save
me
now
and
see
my
friend
i
was
so
convinced
that
i
was
taking
the
route
of
exile
with
my
old
parry
i
was
returning
to
devour
my
poignant
griefs
in
the
little
hermitage
offered
me
by
holland
there
believe
me
count
all
will
soon
be
over
and
death
will
come
quickly
it
is
called
so
often
by
this
body
eaten
up
by
its
soul
and
by
this
soul
which
aspires
to
heaven
your
majesty
has
a
mother
a
sister
and
brothers
your
majesty
is
the
head
of
the
family
and
ought
therefore
to
ask
a
long
life
of
god
instead
of
imploring
him
for
a
prompt
death
your
majesty
is
an
exile
a
fugitive
but
you
have
right
on
your
side
you
ought
to
aspire
to
combats
dangers
business
and
not
to
rest
in
heavens
count
said
charles
with
a
smile
of
indescribable
sadness
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
king
who
reconquered
his
kingdom
with
one
servant
the
age
of
parry
and
with
three
hundred
crowns
which
that
servant
carried
in
his
purse
no
sire
but
i
have
heard
and
that
more
than
once
that
a
dethroned
king
has
recovered
his
kingdom
with
a
firm
will
perseverance
some
friends
and
a
million
skillfully
employed
but
you
can
not
have
understood
me
the
million
i
asked
of
my
brother
louis
was
refused
me
sire
said
athos
will
your
majesty
grant
me
a
few
minutes
and
listen
attentively
to
what
remains
for
me
to
say
to
you
charles
ii
looked
earnestly
at
athos
willingly
monsieur
said
he
then
i
will
show
your
majesty
the
way
resumed
the
count
directing
his
steps
towards
the
house
he
then
conducted
the
king
to
his
study
and
begged
him
to
be
seated
sire
said
he
your
majesty
just
now
told
me
that
in
the
present
state
of
england
a
million
would
suffice
for
the
recovery
of
your
kingdom
to
attempt
it
at
least
monsieur
and
to
die
as
a
king
if
i
should
not
succeed
well
then
sire
let
your
majesty
according
to
the
promise
you
have
made
me
have
the
goodness
to
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
charles
made
an
affirmative
sign
with
his
head
athos
walked
straight
up
to
the
door
the
bolts
of
which
he
drew
after
looking
to
see
if
anybody
was
near
and
then
returned
sire
said
he
your
majesty
has
kindly
remembered
that
i
lent
assistance
to
the
very
noble
and
very
unfortunate
charles
when
his
executioners
conducted
him
from
james
s
to
whitehall
yes
certainly
i
do
remember
it
and
always
shall
remember
it
sire
it
is
a
dismal
history
to
be
heard
by
a
son
who
no
doubt
has
had
it
related
to
him
many
times
and
yet
i
ought
to
repeat
it
to
your
majesty
without
omitting
one
detail
speak
on
monsieur
when
the
king
your
father
ascended
the
scaffold
or
rather
when
he
passed
from
his
chamber
to
the
scaffold
on
a
level
with
his
window
everything
was
prepared
for
his
escape
the
executioner
was
got
out
of
the
way
a
hole
contrived
under
the
floor
of
his
apartment
i
myself
was
beneath
the
funeral
vault
which
i
heard
all
at
once
creak
beneath
his
feet
parry
has
related
to
me
all
these
terrible
details
monsieur
athos
bowed
and
resumed
but
here
is
something
he
had
not
related
to
you
sire
for
what
follows
passed
between
god
your
father
and
myself
and
never
has
the
revelation
of
it
been
made
even
to
my
dearest
friends
go
a
little
further
off
said
the
august
prisoner
to
the
executioner
it
is
but
for
an
instant
and
i
know
that
i
belong
to
you
but
remember
not
to
strike
till
i
give
the
signal
i
wish
to
offer
up
my
prayers
in
freedom
pardon
me
said
charles
turning
very
pale
but
you
count
who
know
so
many
details
of
this
melancholy
event
details
which
as
you
said
just
now
have
never
been
revealed
to
any
one
do
you
know
the
name
of
that
infernal
executioner
of
that
base
wretch
who
concealed
his
face
that
he
might
assassinate
a
king
with
impunity
athos
became
slightly
pale
his
name
said
he
yes
i
know
it
but
can
not
tell
it
and
what
is
become
of
him
for
nobody
in
england
knows
his
destiny
he
is
dead
but
he
did
not
die
in
his
bed
he
did
not
die
a
calm
and
peaceful
death
he
did
not
die
the
death
of
the
good
he
died
a
violent
death
in
a
terrible
night
rendered
so
by
the
passions
of
man
and
a
tempest
from
god
his
body
pierced
by
a
dagger
sank
to
the
depths
of
the
ocean
god
pardon
his
murderer
proceed
then
said
charles
seeing
that
the
count
was
unwilling
to
say
more
the
king
of
england
after
having
as
i
have
said
spoken
thus
to
the
masked
executioner
added
observe
you
will
not
strike
till
i
shall
stretch
out
my
arms
saying
remember
i
was
aware
said
charles
in
an
agitated
voice
that
that
was
the
last
word
pronounced
by
my
unfortunate
father
but
why
and
for
whom
for
the
french
gentleman
placed
beneath
his
scaffold
for
you
then
monsieur
yes
sire
and
every
one
of
the
words
which
he
spoke
to
me
through
the
planks
of
the
scaffold
covered
with
a
black
cloth
still
sounds
in
my
ears
the
king
knelt
down
on
one
knee
comte
de
la
fere
said
he
are
you
there
yes
sire
replied
i
then
the
king
stooped
towards
the
boards
charles
also
palpitating
with
interest
burning
with
grief
stooped
towards
athos
to
catch
one
by
one
every
word
that
escaped
from
him
his
head
touched
that
of
the
comte
then
continued
athos
the
king
stooped
comte
de
la
fere
said
he
i
could
not
be
saved
by
you
it
was
not
to
be
now
even
though
i
commit
a
sacrilege
i
must
speak
to
you
yes
i
have
spoken
to
men
yes
i
have
spoken
to
god
and
i
speak
to
you
the
last
to
sustain
a
cause
which
i
thought
sacred
i
have
lost
the
throne
of
my
fathers
and
the
heritage
of
my
charles
ii
concealed
his
face
in
his
hands
and
a
bitter
tear
glided
between
his
white
and
slender
fingers
i
have
still
a
million
in
gold
continued
the
king
i
buried
it
in
the
vaults
of
the
castle
of
newcastle
a
moment
before
i
left
that
charles
raised
his
head
with
an
expression
of
such
painful
joy
that
it
would
have
drawn
tears
from
any
one
acquainted
with
his
misfortunes
a
million
murmured
he
oh
count
you
alone
know
that
this
money
exists
employ
it
when
you
think
it
can
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
my
eldest
son
and
now
comte
de
la
fere
bid
me
adieu
adieu
adieu
sire
cried
i
charles
arose
and
went
and
leant
his
burning
brow
against
the
window
it
was
then
continued
athos
that
the
king
pronounced
the
word
remember
addressed
to
me
you
see
sire
that
i
have
remembered
the
king
could
not
resist
or
conceal
his
emotion
athos
beheld
the
movement
of
his
shoulders
which
undulated
convulsively
he
heard
the
sobs
which
burst
from
his
breast
he
was
silent
himself
suffocated
by
the
flood
of
bitter
remembrances
he
had
just
poured
upon
that
royal
head
charles
with
a
violent
effort
left
the
window
devoured
his
tears
and
came
and
sat
by
athos
sire
said
the
latter
i
thought
till
that
the
time
had
not
yet
arrived
for
the
employment
of
that
last
resource
but
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
england
i
felt
it
was
approaching
i
meant
to
go
and
inquire
in
what
part
of
the
world
your
majesty
was
and
then
i
purposed
going
to
you
you
come
to
me
sire
that
is
an
indication
that
god
is
with
us
my
lord
said
charles
in
a
voice
choked
by
emotion
you
are
for
me
what
an
angel
sent
from
heaven
would
be
you
are
a
preserver
sent
to
me
from
the
tomb
of
my
father
himself
but
believe
me
for
ten
years
civil
war
has
passed
over
my
country
striking
down
men
tearing
up
soil
it
is
no
more
probable
that
gold
should
remain
in
the
entrails
of
the
earth
than
love
in
the
hearts
of
my
subjects
sire
the
spot
in
which
his
majesty
buried
the
million
is
well
known
to
me
and
no
one
i
am
sure
has
been
able
to
discover
it
besides
is
the
castle
of
newcastle
quite
destroyed
have
they
demolished
it
stone
by
stone
and
uprooted
the
soil
to
the
last
tree
no
it
is
still
standing
but
at
this
moment
general
monk
occupies
it
and
is
encamped
there
the
only
spot
from
which
i
could
look
for
succor
where
i
possess
a
single
resource
you
see
is
invaded
by
my
enemies
general
monk
sire
can
not
have
discovered
the
treasure
which
i
speak
of
yes
but
can
i
go
and
deliver
myself
up
to
monk
in
order
to
recover
this
treasure
ah
count
you
see
plainly
i
must
yield
to
destiny
since
it
strikes
me
to
the
earth
every
time
i
rise
what
can
i
do
with
parry
as
my
only
servant
with
parry
whom
monk
has
already
driven
from
his
presence
no
no
no
count
we
must
yield
to
this
last
blow
but
what
your
majesty
can
not
do
and
what
parry
can
no
more
attempt
do
you
not
believe
that
i
could
succeed
in
accomplishing
you
you
count
you
would
go
if
it
please
your
majesty
said
athos
bowing
to
the
king
yes
i
will
go
sire
what
you
so
happy
here
count
i
am
never
happy
when
i
have
a
duty
left
to
accomplish
and
it
is
an
imperative
duty
which
the
king
your
father
left
me
to
watch
over
your
fortunes
and
make
a
royal
use
of
his
money
so
if
your
majesty
honors
me
with
a
sign
i
will
go
with
you
ah
monsieur
said
the
king
forgetting
all
royal
etiquette
and
throwing
his
arms
around
the
neck
of
athos
you
prove
to
me
that
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
and
that
this
god
sometimes
sends
messengers
to
the
unfortunate
who
groan
on
the
earth
athos
exceedingly
moved
by
this
burst
of
feeling
of
the
young
man
thanked
him
with
profound
respect
and
approached
the
window
grimaud
cried
he
bring
out
my
horses
what
now
immediately
said
the
king
ah
monsieur
you
are
indeed
a
wonderful
man
sire
said
athos
i
know
nothing
more
pressing
than
your
majesty
s
service
besides
added
he
smiling
it
is
a
habit
contracted
long
since
in
the
service
of
the
queen
your
aunt
and
of
the
king
your
father
how
is
it
possible
for
me
to
lose
it
at
the
moment
your
majesty
s
service
calls
for
it
what
a
man
murmured
the
king
then
after
a
moment
s
reflection
but
no
count
i
can
not
expose
you
to
such
privations
i
have
no
means
of
rewarding
such
services
bah
said
athos
laughing
your
majesty
is
joking
have
you
not
a
million
ah
why
am
i
not
possessed
of
half
such
a
sum
i
would
already
have
raised
a
regiment
but
thank
god
i
have
still
a
few
rolls
of
gold
and
some
family
diamonds
left
your
majesty
will
i
hope
deign
to
share
with
a
devoted
servant
with
a
friend
yes
count
but
on
condition
that
in
his
turn
that
friend
will
share
with
me
hereafter
sire
said
athos
opening
a
casket
form
which
he
drew
both
gold
and
jewels
you
see
sire
we
are
too
rich
fortunately
there
are
four
of
us
in
the
event
of
our
meeting
with
thieves
joy
made
the
blood
rush
to
the
pale
cheeks
of
charles
as
he
saw
athos
s
two
horses
led
by
grimaud
already
booted
for
the
journey
advance
towards
the
porch
blaisois
this
letter
for
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
for
everybody
else
i
am
gone
to
paris
i
confide
the
house
to
you
blaisois
blaisois
bowed
shook
hands
with
grimaud
and
shut
the
gate
chapter
xvii
in
which
aramis
is
sought
and
only
bazin
is
found
two
hours
had
scarcely
elapsed
since
the
departure
of
the
master
of
the
house
who
in
blaisois
s
sight
had
taken
the
road
to
paris
when
a
horseman
mounted
on
a
good
pied
horse
stopped
before
the
gate
and
with
a
sonorous
hola
called
the
who
with
the
gardeners
had
formed
a
circle
round
blaisois
the
to
the
household
of
the
chateau
this
hola
doubtless
well
known
to
master
blaisois
made
him
turn
his
head
and
exclaim
monsieur
d
artagnan
run
quickly
you
chaps
and
open
the
gate
a
swarm
of
eight
brisk
lads
flew
to
the
gate
which
was
opened
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
feathers
and
every
one
loaded
him
with
attentions
for
they
knew
the
welcome
this
friend
was
accustomed
to
receive
from
their
master
and
for
such
remarks
the
eye
of
the
valet
may
always
be
depended
upon
ah
said
d
artagnan
with
an
agreeable
smile
balancing
himself
upon
his
stirrup
to
jump
to
the
ground
where
is
that
dear
count
ah
how
unfortunate
you
are
monsieur
said
blaisois
and
how
unfortunate
will
monsieur
le
comte
our
master
think
himself
when
he
hears
of
your
coming
as
ill
luck
will
have
it
monsieur
le
comte
left
home
two
hours
ago
d
artagnan
did
not
trouble
himself
about
such
trifles
very
good
said
he
you
always
speak
the
best
french
in
the
world
you
shall
give
me
a
lesson
in
grammar
and
correct
language
whilst
i
wait
the
return
of
your
master
that
is
impossible
monsieur
said
blaisois
you
would
have
to
wait
too
long
will
he
not
come
back
then
no
nor
nor
the
day
after
monsieur
le
comte
has
gone
on
a
journey
a
journey
said
d
artagnan
surprised
that
s
a
fable
master
blaisois
monsieur
it
is
no
more
than
the
truth
monsieur
has
done
me
the
honor
to
give
me
the
house
in
charge
and
he
added
with
his
voice
so
full
of
authority
and
kindness
that
is
all
one
to
me
you
will
say
i
have
gone
to
well
cried
d
artagnan
since
he
is
gone
towards
paris
that
is
all
i
wanted
to
know
you
should
have
told
me
so
at
first
booby
he
is
then
two
hours
in
advance
yes
monsieur
i
shall
soon
overtake
him
is
he
alone
no
monsieur
who
is
with
him
then
a
gentleman
whom
i
don
t
know
an
old
man
and
m
grimaud
such
a
party
can
not
travel
as
fast
as
i
can
i
will
start
will
monsieur
listen
to
me
an
instant
said
blaisois
laying
his
hand
gently
on
the
reins
of
the
horse
yes
if
you
don
t
favor
me
with
fine
speeches
and
make
haste
well
then
monsieur
that
word
paris
appears
to
me
to
be
only
an
excuse
oh
oh
said
d
artagnan
seriously
an
excuse
eh
yes
monsieur
and
monsieur
le
comte
is
not
going
to
paris
i
will
swear
what
makes
you
think
so
this
grimaud
always
knows
where
our
master
is
going
and
he
had
promised
me
that
the
first
time
he
went
to
paris
he
would
take
a
little
money
for
me
to
my
wife
what
have
you
a
wife
then
i
had
one
she
was
of
this
country
but
monsieur
thought
her
a
noisy
scold
and
i
sent
her
to
paris
it
is
sometimes
inconvenient
but
very
agreeable
at
others
i
understand
but
go
on
you
do
not
believe
the
count
gone
to
paris
no
monsieur
for
then
grimaud
would
have
broken
his
word
he
would
have
perjured
himself
and
that
is
impossible
that
is
impossible
repeated
d
artagnan
quite
in
a
study
because
he
was
quite
convinced
well
my
brave
blaisois
many
thanks
to
you
blaisois
bowed
come
you
know
i
am
not
curious
i
have
serious
business
with
your
master
could
you
not
by
a
little
bit
of
a
word
you
who
speak
so
well
give
me
to
understand
one
syllable
only
i
will
guess
the
rest
upon
my
word
monsieur
i
can
not
i
am
quite
ignorant
where
monsieur
le
comte
is
gone
as
to
listening
at
doors
that
is
contrary
to
my
nature
and
besides
it
is
forbidden
here
my
dear
fellow
said
d
artagnan
this
is
a
very
bad
beginning
for
me
never
mind
you
know
when
monsieur
le
comte
will
return
at
least
as
little
monsieur
as
the
place
of
his
destination
come
blaisois
come
search
monsieur
doubts
my
sincerity
ah
monsieur
that
grieves
me
much
the
devil
take
his
gilded
tongue
grumbled
d
artagnan
a
clown
with
a
word
would
be
worth
a
dozen
of
him
adieu
monsieur
i
have
the
honor
to
present
you
my
respects
cuistre
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
the
fellow
is
unbearable
he
gave
another
look
up
to
the
house
turned
his
horse
s
head
and
set
off
like
a
man
who
has
nothing
either
annoying
or
embarrassing
in
his
mind
when
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
wall
and
out
of
sight
well
now
i
wonder
said
he
breathing
quickly
whether
athos
was
at
home
no
all
those
idlers
standing
with
their
arms
crossed
would
have
been
at
work
if
the
eye
of
the
master
was
near
athos
gone
on
a
journey
that
is
incomprehensible
bah
it
is
all
devilish
mysterious
and
then
no
he
is
not
the
man
i
want
i
want
one
of
a
cunning
patient
mind
my
business
is
at
melun
in
a
certain
presbytery
i
am
acquainted
with
leagues
four
days
and
a
half
well
it
is
fine
weather
and
i
am
free
never
mind
the
distance
and
he
put
his
horse
into
a
trot
directing
his
course
towards
paris
on
the
fourth
day
he
alighted
at
melun
as
he
had
intended
d
artagnan
was
never
in
the
habit
of
asking
any
one
on
the
road
for
any
common
information
for
these
sorts
of
details
unless
in
very
serious
circumstances
he
confided
in
his
perspicacity
which
was
so
seldom
at
fault
in
his
experience
of
thirty
years
and
in
a
great
habit
of
reading
the
physiognomies
of
houses
as
well
as
those
of
men
at
melun
d
artagnan
immediately
found
the
presbytery
a
charming
house
plastered
over
red
brick
with
vines
climbing
along
the
gutters
and
a
cross
in
carved
stone
surmounting
the
ridge
of
the
roof
from
the
of
this
house
came
a
noise
or
rather
a
confusion
of
voices
like
the
chirping
of
young
birds
when
the
brood
is
just
hatched
under
the
down
one
of
these
voices
was
spelling
the
alphabet
distinctly
a
voice
thick
yet
pleasant
at
the
same
time
scolded
the
talkers
and
corrected
the
faults
of
the
reader
d
artagnan
recognized
that
voice
and
as
the
window
of
the
was
open
he
leant
down
from
his
horse
under
the
branches
and
red
fibers
of
the
vine
and
cried
bazin
my
dear
bazin
to
you
a
short
fat
man
with
a
flat
face
a
cranium
ornamented
with
a
crown
of
gray
hairs
cut
short
in
imitation
of
a
tonsure
and
covered
with
an
old
black
velvet
cap
arose
as
soon
as
he
heard
d
artagnan
we
ought
not
to
say
arose
but
bounded
up
in
fact
bazin
bounded
up
carrying
with
him
his
little
low
chair
which
the
children
tried
to
take
away
with
battles
more
fierce
than
those
of
the
greeks
endeavoring
to
recover
the
body
of
patroclus
from
the
hands
of
the
trojans
bazin
did
more
than
bound
he
let
fall
both
his
alphabet
and
his
ferule
you
said
he
you
monsieur
d
artagnan
yes
myself
where
is
aramis
no
le
chevalier
d
herblay
no
i
am
still
mistaken
monsieur
le
ah
monsieur
said
bazin
with
dignity
monseigneur
is
at
his
diocese
what
did
you
say
said
d
artagnan
bazin
repeated
the
sentence
ah
ah
but
has
aramis
a
diocese
yes
monsieur
why
not
is
he
a
bishop
then
why
where
can
you
come
from
said
bazin
rather
irreverently
that
you
don
t
know
that
my
dear
bazin
we
pagans
we
men
of
the
sword
know
very
well
when
a
man
is
made
a
colonel
or
or
marshal
of
france
but
if
he
be
made
a
bishop
or
pope
devil
take
me
if
the
news
reaches
us
before
the
three
quarters
of
the
earth
have
had
the
advantage
of
it
hush
hush
said
bazin
opening
his
eyes
do
not
spoil
these
poor
children
in
whom
i
am
endeavoring
to
inculcate
such
good
principles
in
fact
the
children
had
surrounded
d
artagnan
whose
horse
long
sword
spurs
and
martial
air
they
very
much
admired
but
above
all
they
admired
his
strong
voice
so
that
when
he
uttered
his
oath
the
whole
school
cried
out
the
devil
take
me
with
fearful
bursts
of
laughter
shouts
and
bounds
which
delighted
the
musketeer
and
bewildered
the
old
pedagogue
there
said
he
hold
your
tongues
you
brats
you
have
come
d
artagnan
and
all
my
good
principles
fly
away
with
you
as
usual
comes
disorder
babel
is
revived
ah
good
lord
ah
the
wild
little
wretches
and
the
worthy
bazin
distributed
right
and
left
blows
which
increased
the
cries
of
his
scholars
by
changing
the
nature
of
them
at
least
said
he
you
will
no
longer
decoy
any
one
here
do
you
think
so
said
d
artagnan
with
a
smile
which
made
a
shudder
creep
over
the
shoulders
of
bazin
he
is
capable
of
it
murmured
he
where
is
your
master
s
diocese
monseigneur
rene
is
bishop
of
vannes
who
had
him
nominated
why
monsieur
le
surintendant
our
neighbor
what
monsieur
fouquet
to
be
sure
he
did
is
aramis
on
good
terms
with
him
then
monseigneur
preached
every
sunday
at
the
house
of
monsieur
le
surintendant
at
vaux
then
they
hunted
together
ah
and
monseigneur
composed
his
homilies
no
i
mean
his
sermons
with
monsieur
le
surintendant
bah
he
preached
in
verse
then
this
worthy
bishop
monsieur
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
not
jest
with
sacred
things
there
bazin
there
so
then
aramis
is
at
vannes
at
vannes
in
bretagne
you
are
a
deceitful
old
hunks
bazin
that
is
not
true
see
monsieur
if
you
please
the
apartments
of
the
presbytery
are
empty
he
is
right
there
said
d
artagnan
looking
attentively
at
the
house
the
aspect
of
which
announced
solitude
but
monseigneur
must
have
written
you
an
account
of
his
promotion
when
did
it
take
place
a
month
back
oh
then
there
is
no
time
lost
aramis
can
not
yet
have
wanted
me
but
how
is
it
bazin
you
do
not
follow
your
master
monsieur
i
can
not
i
have
occupations
your
alphabet
and
my
penitents
what
do
you
confess
then
are
you
a
priest
the
same
as
one
i
have
such
a
call
but
the
orders
oh
said
bazin
without
hesitation
now
that
monseigneur
is
a
bishop
i
shall
soon
have
my
orders
or
at
least
my
dispensations
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
decidedly
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
there
will
be
no
means
of
uprooting
these
people
get
me
some
supper
bazin
with
pleasure
monsieur
a
fowl
a
bouillon
and
a
bottle
of
wine
this
is
saturday
night
monsieur
it
is
a
day
of
abstinence
i
have
a
dispensation
said
d
artagnan
bazin
looked
at
him
suspiciously
ah
ah
master
hypocrite
said
the
musketeer
for
whom
do
you
take
me
if
you
who
are
the
valet
hope
for
dispensation
to
commit
a
crime
shall
not
i
the
friend
of
your
bishop
have
dispensation
for
eating
meat
at
the
call
of
my
stomach
make
yourself
agreeable
with
me
bazin
or
by
heavens
i
will
complain
to
the
king
and
you
shall
never
confess
now
you
know
that
the
nomination
of
bishops
rests
with
the
king
i
have
the
king
i
am
the
stronger
bazin
smiled
hypocritically
ah
but
we
have
monsieur
le
surintendant
said
he
and
you
laugh
at
the
king
then
bazin
made
no
reply
his
smile
was
sufficiently
eloquent
my
supper
said
d
artagnan
it
is
getting
towards
seven
o
clock
bazin
turned
round
and
ordered
the
eldest
of
the
pupils
to
inform
the
cook
in
the
meantime
d
artagnan
surveyed
the
presbytery
phew
said
he
disdainfully
monseigneur
lodged
his
grandeur
very
meanly
here
we
have
the
chateau
de
vaux
said
bazin
which
is
perhaps
equal
to
the
louvre
said
d
artagnan
jeeringly
which
is
better
replied
bazin
with
the
greatest
coolness
imaginable
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
he
would
perhaps
have
prolonged
the
discussion
and
maintained
the
superiority
of
the
louvre
but
the
lieutenant
perceived
that
his
horse
remained
fastened
to
the
bars
of
a
gate
the
devil
said
he
get
my
horse
looked
after
your
master
the
bishop
has
none
like
him
in
his
stables
bazin
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
horse
and
replied
monsieur
le
surintendant
gave
him
four
from
his
own
stables
and
each
of
the
four
is
worth
four
of
yours
the
blood
mounted
to
the
face
of
d
artagnan
his
hand
itched
and
his
eye
glanced
over
the
head
of
bazin
to
select
the
place
upon
which
he
should
discharge
his
anger
but
it
passed
away
reflection
came
and
d
artagnan
contented
himself
with
saying
the
devil
the
devil
i
have
done
well
to
quit
the
service
of
the
king
tell
me
worthy
master
bazin
added
he
how
many
musketeers
does
monsieur
le
surintendant
retain
in
his
service
he
could
have
all
there
are
in
the
kingdom
with
his
money
replied
bazin
closing
his
book
and
dismissing
the
boys
with
some
kindly
blows
of
his
cane
the
devil
the
devil
repeated
d
artagnan
once
more
as
if
to
annoy
the
pedagogue
but
as
supper
was
now
announced
he
followed
the
cook
who
introduced
him
into
the
refectory
where
it
awaited
him
d
artagnan
placed
himself
at
the
table
and
began
a
hearty
attack
upon
his
fowl
it
appears
to
me
said
d
artagnan
biting
with
all
his
might
at
the
tough
fowl
they
had
served
up
to
him
and
which
they
had
evidently
forgotten
to
fatten
it
appears
that
i
have
done
wrong
in
not
seeking
service
with
that
master
yonder
a
powerful
noble
this
intendant
seemingly
in
good
truth
we
poor
fellows
know
nothing
at
the
court
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
prevent
our
seeing
the
large
stars
which
are
also
suns
at
a
little
greater
distance
from
our
earth
that
is
all
as
d
artagnan
delighted
both
from
pleasure
and
system
in
making
people
talk
about
things
which
interested
him
he
fenced
in
his
best
style
with
master
bazin
but
it
was
pure
loss
of
time
beyond
the
tiresome
and
hyperbolical
praises
of
monsieur
le
surintendant
of
the
finances
bazin
who
on
his
side
was
on
his
guard
afforded
nothing
but
platitudes
to
the
curiosity
of
d
artagnan
so
that
our
musketeer
in
a
tolerably
bad
humor
desired
to
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
he
had
supped
d
artagnan
was
introduced
by
bazin
into
a
mean
chamber
in
which
there
was
a
poor
bed
but
d
artagnan
was
not
fastidious
in
that
respect
he
had
been
told
that
aramis
had
taken
away
the
key
of
his
own
private
apartment
and
as
he
knew
aramis
was
a
very
particular
man
and
had
generally
many
things
to
conceal
in
his
apartment
he
had
not
been
surprised
he
therefore
although
it
seemed
comparatively
even
harder
attacked
the
bed
as
bravely
as
he
had
done
the
fowl
and
as
he
had
as
good
an
inclination
to
sleep
as
he
had
had
to
eat
he
took
scarcely
longer
time
to
be
snoring
harmoniously
than
he
had
employed
in
picking
the
last
bones
of
the
bird
since
he
was
no
longer
in
the
service
of
any
one
d
artagnan
had
promised
himself
to
indulge
in
sleeping
as
soundly
as
he
had
formerly
slept
lightly
but
with
whatever
good
faith
d
artagnan
had
made
himself
this
promise
and
whatever
desire
he
might
have
to
keep
it
religiously
he
was
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
loud
noise
of
carriages
and
servants
on
horseback
a
sudden
illumination
flashed
over
the
walls
of
his
chamber
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
in
his
shirt
can
the
king
be
coming
this
way
he
thought
rubbing
his
eyes
in
truth
such
a
suite
can
only
be
attached
to
royalty
vive
le
monsieur
le
surintendant
cried
or
rather
vociferated
from
a
window
on
the
a
voice
which
he
recognized
as
bazin
s
who
at
the
same
time
waved
a
handkerchief
with
one
hand
and
held
a
large
candle
in
the
other
d
artagnan
then
saw
something
like
a
brilliant
human
form
leaning
out
of
the
principal
carriage
at
the
same
time
loud
bursts
of
laughter
caused
no
doubt
by
the
strange
figure
of
bazin
and
issuing
from
the
same
carriage
left
as
it
were
a
train
of
joy
upon
the
passage
of
the
rapid
cortege
i
might
easily
see
it
was
not
the
king
said
d
artagnan
people
don
t
laugh
so
heartily
when
the
king
passes
hola
bazin
cried
he
to
his
neighbor
of
whose
body
still
hung
out
of
the
window
to
follow
the
carriage
with
his
eyes
as
long
as
he
could
what
is
all
that
about
it
is
fouquet
said
bazin
in
a
patronizing
tone
and
all
those
people
that
is
the
court
of
m
fouquet
oh
oh
said
d
artagnan
what
would
de
mazarin
say
to
that
if
he
heard
it
and
he
returned
to
his
bed
asking
himself
how
aramis
always
contrived
to
be
protected
by
the
most
powerful
personages
in
the
kingdom
is
it
that
he
has
more
luck
than
i
or
that
i
am
a
greater
fool
than
he
bah
that
was
the
concluding
word
by
the
aid
of
which
d
artagnan
having
become
wise
now
terminated
every
thought
and
every
period
of
his
style
formerly
he
said
mordioux
which
was
a
prick
of
the
spur
but
now
he
had
become
older
and
he
murmured
that
philosophical
bah
which
served
as
a
bridle
to
all
the
passions
chapter
xviii
in
which
d
artagnan
seeks
porthos
and
only
finds
mousqueton
when
d
artagnan
had
perfectly
convinced
himself
that
the
absence
of
the
d
herblay
was
real
and
that
his
friend
was
not
to
be
found
at
melun
or
in
its
vicinity
he
left
bazin
without
regret
cast
an
glance
at
the
magnificent
chateau
de
vaux
which
was
beginning
to
shine
with
that
splendor
which
brought
on
its
ruin
and
compressing
his
lips
like
a
man
full
of
mistrust
and
suspicion
he
put
spurs
to
his
pied
horse
saying
well
well
i
have
still
pierrefonds
left
and
there
i
shall
find
the
best
man
and
the
best
filled
coffer
and
that
is
all
i
want
for
i
have
an
idea
of
my
own
we
will
spare
our
readers
the
prosaic
incidents
of
d
artagnan
s
journey
which
terminated
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
within
sight
of
pierrefonds
d
artagnan
came
by
the
way
of
and
crepy
at
a
distance
he
perceived
the
castle
of
louis
of
orleans
which
having
become
part
of
the
crown
domain
was
kept
by
an
old
concierge
this
was
one
of
those
marvelous
manors
of
the
middle
ages
with
walls
twenty
feet
in
thickness
and
a
hundred
in
height
d
artagnan
rode
slowly
past
its
walls
measured
its
towers
with
his
eye
and
descended
into
the
valley
from
afar
he
looked
down
upon
the
chateau
of
porthos
situated
on
the
shores
of
a
small
lake
and
contiguous
to
a
magnificent
forest
it
was
the
same
place
we
have
already
had
the
honor
of
describing
to
our
readers
we
shall
therefore
satisfy
ourselves
with
naming
it
the
first
thing
d
artagnan
perceived
after
the
fine
trees
the
may
sun
gilding
the
sides
of
the
green
hills
the
long
rows
of
trees
which
stretched
out
towards
compiegne
was
a
large
rolling
box
pushed
forward
by
two
servants
and
dragged
by
two
others
in
this
box
there
was
an
enormous
thing
which
went
along
the
smiling
glades
of
the
park
thus
dragged
and
pushed
this
thing
at
a
distance
could
not
be
distinguished
and
signified
absolutely
nothing
nearer
it
was
a
hogshead
muffled
in
green
cloth
when
close
it
was
a
man
or
rather
a
poussa
the
inferior
extremity
of
whom
spreading
over
the
interior
of
the
box
entirely
filled
it
when
still
closer
the
man
was
mousqueton
mousqueton
with
gray
hair
and
a
face
as
red
as
punchinello
s
pardieu
cried
d
artagnan
why
that
s
my
dear
monsieur
mousqueton
ah
cried
the
fat
man
ah
what
happiness
what
joy
there
s
d
artagnan
stop
you
rascals
these
last
words
were
addressed
to
the
lackeys
who
pushed
and
dragged
him
the
box
stopped
and
the
four
lackeys
with
a
precision
quite
military
took
off
their
laced
hats
and
ranged
themselves
behind
it
oh
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
mousqueton
why
can
i
not
embrace
your
knees
but
i
have
become
impotent
as
you
see
dame
my
dear
mousqueton
it
is
age
no
monsieur
it
is
not
age
it
is
infirmities
troubles
troubles
you
mousqueton
said
d
artagnan
making
the
tour
of
the
box
are
you
out
of
your
mind
my
dear
friend
thank
god
you
are
as
hearty
as
a
oak
ah
but
my
legs
monsieur
my
legs
groaned
the
faithful
servant
what
s
the
matter
with
your
legs
oh
they
will
no
longer
bear
me
ah
the
ungrateful
things
and
yet
you
feed
them
well
mousqueton
apparently
alas
yes
they
can
reproach
me
with
nothing
in
that
respect
said
mousqueton
with
a
sigh
i
have
always
done
what
i
could
for
my
poor
body
i
am
not
selfish
and
mousqueton
sighed
afresh
i
wonder
whether
mousqueton
wants
to
be
a
baron
too
as
he
sighs
after
that
fashion
thought
d
artagnan
mon
dieu
monsieur
said
mousqueton
as
if
rousing
himself
from
a
painful
reverie
how
happy
monseigneur
will
be
that
you
have
thought
of
him
kind
porthos
cried
d
artagnan
i
am
anxious
to
embrace
him
oh
said
mousqueton
much
affected
i
shall
certainly
write
to
him
what
cried
d
artagnan
you
will
write
to
him
this
very
day
i
shall
not
delay
it
an
hour
is
he
not
here
then
no
monsieur
but
is
he
near
at
hand
is
he
far
off
oh
can
i
tell
monsieur
can
i
tell
mordioux
cried
the
musketeer
stamping
with
his
foot
i
am
unfortunate
porthos
is
such
a
monsieur
there
is
not
a
more
sedentary
man
that
monseigneur
but
but
what
when
a
friend
presses
you
a
friend
doubtless
the
worthy
m
d
herblay
what
has
aramis
pressed
porthos
this
is
how
the
thing
happened
monsieur
d
artagnan
d
herblay
wrote
to
monseigneur
indeed
a
letter
monsieur
such
a
pressing
letter
that
it
threw
us
all
into
a
bustle
tell
me
all
about
it
my
dear
friend
said
d
artagnan
but
remove
these
people
a
little
further
off
first
mousqueton
shouted
fall
back
you
fellows
with
such
powerful
lungs
that
the
breath
without
the
words
would
have
been
sufficient
to
disperse
the
four
lackeys
d
artagnan
seated
himself
on
the
shaft
of
the
box
and
opened
his
ears
monsieur
said
mousqueton
monseigneur
then
received
a
letter
from
le
d
herblay
eight
or
nine
days
ago
it
was
the
day
of
the
rustic
pleasures
yes
it
must
have
been
wednesday
what
do
you
mean
said
d
artagnan
the
day
of
rustic
pleasures
yes
monsieur
we
have
so
many
pleasures
to
take
in
this
delightful
country
that
we
were
encumbered
by
them
so
much
so
that
we
have
been
forced
to
regulate
the
distribution
of
them
how
easily
do
i
recognize
porthos
s
love
of
order
in
that
now
that
idea
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
but
then
i
am
not
encumbered
with
pleasures
we
were
though
said
mousqueton
and
how
did
you
regulate
the
matter
let
me
know
said
d
artagnan
it
is
rather
long
monsieur
never
mind
we
have
plenty
of
time
and
you
speak
so
well
my
dear
mousqueton
that
it
is
really
a
pleasure
to
hear
you
it
is
true
said
mousqueton
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
which
emanated
evidently
from
the
justice
which
had
been
rendered
him
it
is
true
i
have
made
great
progress
in
the
company
of
monseigneur
i
am
waiting
for
the
distribution
of
the
pleasures
mousqueton
and
with
impatience
i
want
to
know
if
i
have
arrived
on
a
lucky
day
oh
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
mousqueton
in
a
melancholy
tone
since
monseigneur
s
departure
all
the
pleasures
have
gone
too
well
my
dear
mousqueton
refresh
your
memory
with
what
day
shall
i
begin
eh
pardieux
begin
with
sunday
that
is
the
lord
s
day
sunday
monsieur
yes
sunday
pleasures
are
religious
monseigneur
goes
to
mass
makes
the
and
has
discourses
and
instructions
made
to
him
by
his
that
is
not
very
amusing
but
we
expect
a
carmelite
from
paris
who
will
do
the
duty
of
our
almonry
and
who
we
are
assured
speaks
very
well
which
will
keep
us
awake
whereas
our
present
almoner
always
sends
us
to
sleep
these
are
sunday
religious
pleasures
on
monday
worldly
pleasures
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
what
do
you
mean
by
that
let
us
have
a
glimpse
at
your
worldly
pleasures
monsieur
on
monday
we
go
into
the
world
we
pay
and
receive
visits
we
play
on
the
lute
we
dance
we
make
verses
and
burn
a
little
incense
in
honor
of
the
ladies
peste
that
is
the
height
of
gallantry
said
the
musketeer
who
was
obliged
to
call
to
his
aid
all
the
strength
of
his
facial
muscles
to
suppress
an
enormous
inclination
to
laugh
tuesday
learned
pleasures
good
cried
d
artagnan
what
are
they
detail
them
my
dear
mousqueton
monseigneur
has
bought
a
sphere
or
globe
which
i
shall
show
you
it
fills
all
the
perimeter
of
the
great
tower
except
a
gallery
which
he
has
had
built
over
the
sphere
there
are
little
strings
and
brass
wires
to
which
the
sun
and
moon
are
hooked
it
all
turns
and
that
is
very
beautiful
monseigneur
points
out
to
me
the
seas
and
distant
countries
we
don
t
intend
to
visit
them
but
it
is
very
interesting
interesting
yes
that
s
the
word
repeated
d
artagnan
and
wednesday
rustic
pleasures
as
i
have
had
the
honor
to
tell
you
monsieur
le
chevalier
we
look
over
monseigneur
s
sheep
and
goats
we
make
the
shepherds
dance
to
pipes
and
reeds
as
is
written
in
a
book
monseigneur
has
in
his
library
which
is
called
the
author
died
about
a
month
ago
monsieur
racan
perhaps
said
d
artagnan
yes
that
was
his
name
racan
but
that
is
not
all
we
angle
in
the
little
canal
after
which
we
dine
crowned
with
flowers
that
is
wednesday
peste
said
d
artagnan
you
don
t
divide
your
pleasures
badly
and
thursday
what
can
be
left
for
poor
thursday
it
is
not
very
unfortunate
monsieur
said
mousqueton
smiling
thursday
olympian
pleasures
ah
monsieur
that
is
superb
we
get
together
all
monseigneur
s
young
vassals
and
we
make
them
throw
the
disc
wrestle
and
run
races
monseigneur
can
t
run
now
no
more
can
i
but
monseigneur
throws
the
disc
as
nobody
else
can
throw
it
and
when
he
does
deal
a
blow
oh
that
proves
a
misfortune
how
so
yes
monsieur
we
were
obliged
to
renounce
the
cestus
he
cracked
heads
he
broke
jaws
beat
in
ribs
it
was
charming
sport
but
nobody
was
willing
to
play
with
him
then
his
wrist
oh
monsieur
firmer
than
ever
monseigneur
gets
a
trifle
weaker
in
his
legs
he
confesses
that
himself
but
his
strength
has
all
taken
refuge
in
his
arms
so
that
so
that
he
can
knock
down
bullocks
as
he
used
to
formerly
monsieur
better
than
that
he
beats
in
walls
lately
after
having
supped
with
one
of
our
farmers
you
know
how
popular
and
kind
monseigneur
is
after
supper
as
a
joke
he
struck
the
wall
a
blow
the
wall
crumbled
away
beneath
his
hand
the
roof
fell
in
and
three
men
and
an
old
woman
were
stifled
good
god
mousqueton
and
your
master
oh
monseigneur
a
little
skin
was
rubbed
off
his
head
we
bathed
the
wounds
with
some
water
which
the
monks
gave
us
but
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
his
hand
nothing
no
nothing
monsieur
deuce
take
the
olympic
pleasures
they
must
cost
your
master
too
dear
for
widows
and
orphans
they
all
had
pensions
monsieur
a
tenth
of
monseigneur
s
revenue
was
spent
in
that
way
then
pass
on
to
friday
said
d
artagnan
friday
noble
and
warlike
pleasures
we
hunt
we
fence
we
dress
falcons
and
break
horses
then
saturday
is
the
day
for
intellectual
pleasures
we
adorn
our
minds
we
look
at
monseigneur
s
pictures
and
statues
we
write
even
and
trace
plans
and
then
we
fire
monseigneur
s
cannon
you
draw
plans
and
fire
cannon
yes
monsieur
why
my
friend
said
d
artagnan
du
vallon
in
truth
possesses
the
most
subtle
and
amiable
mind
that
i
know
but
there
is
one
kind
of
pleasure
you
have
forgotten
it
appears
to
me
what
is
that
monsieur
asked
mousqueton
with
anxiety
the
material
pleasures
mousqueton
colored
what
do
you
mean
by
that
monsieur
said
he
casting
down
his
eyes
i
mean
the
table
good
wine
evenings
occupied
in
passing
the
bottle
ah
monsieur
we
don
t
reckon
those
pleasures
we
practice
them
every
day
my
brave
mousqueton
resumed
d
artagnan
pardon
me
but
i
was
so
absorbed
in
your
charming
recital
that
i
have
forgotten
the
principal
object
of
our
conversation
which
was
to
learn
what
le
d
herblay
could
have
to
write
to
your
master
about
that
is
true
monsieur
said
mousqueton
the
pleasures
have
misled
us
well
monsieur
this
is
the
whole
affair
i
am
all
attention
mousqueton
on
wednesday
the
day
of
the
rustic
pleasures
yes
a
letter
arrived
he
received
it
from
my
hands
i
had
recognized
the
writing
well
monseigneur
read
it
and
cried
out
quick
my
horses
my
arms
oh
good
lord
then
it
was
for
some
duel
said
d
artagnan
no
monsieur
there
were
only
these
words
dear
porthos
set
out
if
you
would
wish
to
arrive
before
the
equinox
i
expect
mordioux
said
d
artagnan
thoughtfully
that
was
pressing
apparently
i
think
so
therefore
continued
mousqueton
monseigneur
set
out
the
very
same
day
with
his
secretary
in
order
to
endeavor
to
arrive
in
time
and
did
he
arrive
in
time
i
hope
so
monseigneur
who
is
hasty
as
you
know
monsieur
repeated
incessantly
tonne
dieu
what
can
this
mean
the
equinox
never
mind
a
fellow
must
be
well
mounted
to
arrive
before
i
and
you
think
porthos
will
have
arrived
first
do
you
asked
d
artagnan
i
am
sure
of
it
this
equinox
however
rich
he
may
be
has
certainly
no
horses
so
good
as
monseigneur
s
d
artagnan
repressed
his
inclination
to
laugh
because
the
brevity
of
aramis
s
letter
gave
rise
to
reflection
he
followed
mousqueton
or
rather
mousqueton
s
chariot
to
the
castle
he
sat
down
to
a
sumptuous
table
of
which
they
did
him
the
honors
as
to
a
king
but
he
could
draw
nothing
from
mousqueton
the
faithful
servant
seemed
to
shed
tears
at
will
but
that
was
all
d
artagnan
after
a
night
passed
in
an
excellent
bed
reflected
much
upon
the
meaning
of
aramis
s
letter
puzzled
himself
as
to
the
relation
of
the
equinox
with
the
affairs
of
porthos
and
being
unable
to
make
anything
out
unless
it
concerned
some
amour
of
the
bishop
s
for
which
it
was
necessary
that
the
days
and
nights
should
be
equal
d
artagnan
left
pierrefonds
as
he
had
left
melun
as
he
had
left
the
chateau
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
it
was
not
however
without
a
melancholy
which
might
in
good
sooth
pass
for
one
of
the
most
dismal
of
d
artagnan
s
moods
his
head
cast
down
his
eyes
fixed
he
suffered
his
legs
to
hang
on
each
side
of
his
horse
and
said
to
himself
in
that
vague
sort
of
reverie
which
ascends
sometimes
to
the
sublimest
eloquence
no
more
friends
no
more
future
no
more
anything
my
energies
are
broken
like
the
bonds
of
our
ancient
friendship
oh
old
age
is
coming
cold
and
inexorable
it
envelopes
in
its
funeral
crepe
all
that
was
brilliant
all
that
was
embalming
in
my
youth
then
it
throws
that
sweet
burthen
on
its
shoulders
and
carries
it
away
with
the
rest
into
the
fathomless
gulf
of
death
a
shudder
crept
through
the
heart
of
the
gascon
so
brave
and
so
strong
against
all
the
misfortunes
of
life
and
during
some
moments
the
clouds
appeared
black
to
him
the
earth
slippery
and
full
of
pits
as
that
of
cemeteries
whither
am
i
going
said
he
to
himself
what
am
i
going
to
do
alone
quite
alone
without
family
without
friends
bah
cried
he
all
at
once
and
he
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
who
having
found
nothing
melancholy
in
the
heavy
oats
of
pierrefonds
profited
by
this
permission
to
show
his
gayety
in
a
gallop
which
absorbed
two
leagues
to
paris
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
and
on
the
morrow
he
alighted
in
paris
he
had
devoted
ten
days
to
this
journey
chapter
xix
what
d
artagnan
went
to
paris
for
the
lieutenant
dismounted
before
a
shop
in
the
rue
des
lombards
at
the
sign
of
the
pilon
d
or
a
man
of
good
appearance
wearing
a
white
apron
and
stroking
his
gray
mustache
with
a
large
hand
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
on
perceiving
the
pied
horse
monsieur
le
chevalier
said
he
ah
is
that
you
bon
jour
planchet
replied
d
artagnan
stooping
to
enter
the
shop
quick
somebody
cried
planchet
to
look
after
monsieur
d
artagnan
s
horse
somebody
to
get
ready
his
room
somebody
to
prepare
his
supper
thanks
planchet
my
children
said
d
artagnan
to
the
eager
boys
allow
me
to
send
off
this
coffee
this
treacle
and
these
raisins
said
planchet
they
are
for
the
of
monsieur
le
surintendant
send
them
off
send
them
off
that
is
only
the
affair
of
a
moment
then
we
shall
sup
arrange
it
that
we
may
sup
alone
i
want
to
speak
to
you
planchet
looked
at
his
old
master
in
a
significant
manner
oh
don
t
be
uneasy
it
is
nothing
unpleasant
said
d
artagnan
so
much
the
better
so
much
the
better
and
planchet
breathed
freely
again
whilst
d
artagnan
seated
himself
quietly
down
in
the
shop
upon
a
bale
of
corks
and
made
a
survey
of
the
premises
the
shop
was
well
stocked
there
was
a
mingled
perfume
of
ginger
cinnamon
and
ground
pepper
which
made
d
artagnan
sneeze
the
proud
of
being
in
company
with
so
renowned
a
warrior
of
a
lieutenant
of
musketeers
who
approached
the
person
of
the
king
began
to
work
with
an
enthusiasm
which
was
something
like
delirium
and
to
serve
the
customers
with
a
disdainful
haste
that
was
noticed
by
several
planchet
put
away
his
money
and
made
up
his
accounts
amidst
civilities
addressed
to
his
former
master
planchet
had
with
his
equals
the
short
speech
and
haughty
familiarity
of
the
rich
shopkeeper
who
serves
everybody
and
waits
for
nobody
d
artagnan
observed
this
habit
with
a
pleasure
which
we
shall
analyze
presently
he
saw
night
come
on
by
degrees
and
at
length
planchet
conducted
him
to
a
chamber
on
the
first
story
where
amidst
bales
and
chests
a
table
very
nicely
set
out
awaited
the
two
guests
d
artagnan
took
advantage
of
a
moment
s
pause
to
examine
the
countenance
of
planchet
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
a
year
the
shrewd
planchet
had
acquired
a
slight
protuberance
in
front
but
his
countenance
was
not
puffed
his
keen
eye
still
played
with
facility
in
its
orbit
and
fat
which
levels
all
the
characteristic
saliences
of
the
human
face
had
not
yet
touched
either
his
high
the
sign
of
cunning
and
cupidity
or
his
pointed
chin
the
sign
of
acuteness
and
perseverance
planchet
reigned
with
as
much
majesty
in
his
as
in
his
shop
he
set
before
his
master
a
frugal
but
perfectly
parisian
repast
roast
meat
cooked
at
the
baker
s
with
vegetables
salad
and
a
dessert
borrowed
from
the
shop
itself
d
artagnan
was
pleased
that
the
grocer
had
drawn
from
behind
the
fagots
a
bottle
of
that
anjou
wine
which
during
all
his
life
had
been
d
artagnan
s
favorite
wine
formerly
monsieur
said
planchet
with
a
smile
full
of
bonhomie
it
was
i
who
drank
your
wine
now
you
do
me
the
honor
to
drink
mine
and
thank
god
friend
planchet
i
shall
drink
it
for
a
long
time
to
come
i
hope
for
at
present
i
am
free
free
you
have
a
leave
of
absence
monsieur
unlimited
you
are
leaving
the
service
said
planchet
stupefied
yes
i
am
resting
and
the
king
cried
planchet
who
could
not
suppose
it
possible
that
the
king
could
do
without
the
services
of
such
a
man
as
d
artagnan
the
king
will
try
his
fortune
elsewhere
but
we
have
supped
well
you
are
disposed
to
enjoy
yourself
you
invite
me
to
confide
in
you
open
your
ears
then
they
are
open
and
planchet
with
a
laugh
more
frank
than
cunning
opened
a
bottle
of
white
wine
leave
me
my
reason
at
least
oh
as
to
you
losing
your
head
you
monsieur
now
my
head
is
my
own
and
i
mean
to
take
better
care
of
it
than
ever
in
the
first
place
we
shall
talk
business
how
fares
our
wonderfully
well
monsieur
the
twenty
thousand
livres
i
had
of
you
are
still
employed
in
my
trade
in
which
they
bring
me
nine
per
cent
i
give
you
seven
so
i
gain
two
by
you
and
you
are
still
satisfied
delighted
have
you
brought
me
any
more
better
than
that
but
do
you
want
any
oh
not
at
all
every
one
is
willing
to
trust
me
now
i
am
extending
my
business
that
was
your
intention
i
play
the
banker
a
little
i
buy
goods
of
my
needy
brethren
i
lend
money
to
those
who
are
not
ready
for
their
payments
without
usury
oh
monsieur
in
the
course
of
the
last
week
i
have
had
two
meetings
on
the
boulevards
on
account
of
the
word
you
have
just
pronounced
what
you
shall
see
it
concerned
a
loan
the
borrower
gives
me
in
pledge
some
raw
sugars
on
condition
that
i
should
sell
if
repayment
were
not
made
within
a
fixed
period
i
lend
a
thousand
livres
he
does
not
pay
me
and
i
sell
the
sugars
for
thirteen
hundred
livres
he
learns
this
and
claims
a
hundred
crowns
ma
foi
i
refused
pretending
that
i
could
not
sell
them
for
more
than
nine
hundred
livres
he
accused
me
of
usury
i
begged
him
to
repeat
that
word
to
me
behind
the
boulevards
he
was
an
old
guard
and
he
came
and
i
passed
your
sword
through
his
left
thigh
tu
dieu
what
a
pretty
sort
of
banker
you
make
said
d
artagnan
for
above
thirteen
per
cent
i
fight
replied
planchet
that
is
my
character
take
only
twelve
said
d
artagnan
and
call
the
rest
premium
and
brokerage
you
are
right
monsieur
but
to
your
business
ah
planchet
it
is
very
long
and
very
hard
to
speak
do
speak
it
nevertheless
d
artagnan
twisted
his
mustache
like
a
man
embarrassed
with
the
confidence
he
is
about
to
make
and
mistrustful
of
his
confidant
is
it
an
investment
asked
planchet
why
yes
at
good
profit
a
capital
profit
four
hundred
per
cent
planchet
planchet
gave
such
a
blow
with
his
fist
upon
the
table
that
the
bottles
bounded
as
if
they
had
been
frightened
good
heavens
is
that
possible
i
think
it
will
be
more
replied
d
artagnan
coolly
but
i
like
to
lay
it
at
the
lowest
the
devil
said
planchet
drawing
nearer
why
monsieur
that
is
magnificent
can
one
put
much
money
in
it
twenty
thousand
livres
each
planchet
why
that
is
all
you
have
monsieur
for
how
long
a
time
for
a
month
and
that
will
give
us
fifty
thousand
livres
each
profit
it
is
monstrous
it
is
worth
while
to
fight
for
such
interest
as
that
in
fact
i
believe
it
will
be
necessary
to
fight
not
a
little
said
d
artagnan
with
the
same
tranquillity
but
this
time
there
are
two
of
us
planchet
and
i
shall
take
all
the
blows
to
myself
oh
monsieur
i
will
not
allow
that
planchet
you
can
not
be
concerned
in
it
you
would
be
obliged
to
leave
your
business
and
your
family
the
affair
is
not
in
paris
then
no
abroad
in
england
a
speculative
country
that
is
true
said
planchet
a
country
that
i
know
well
what
sort
of
an
affair
monsieur
without
too
much
curiosity
planchet
it
is
a
restoration
of
monuments
yes
of
monuments
we
shall
restore
whitehall
that
is
important
and
in
a
month
you
think
i
shall
undertake
it
that
concerns
you
monsieur
and
when
once
you
are
engaged
yes
that
concerns
me
i
know
what
i
am
about
nevertheless
i
will
freely
consult
with
you
you
do
me
great
honor
but
i
know
very
little
about
architecture
planchet
you
are
wrong
you
are
an
excellent
architect
quite
as
good
as
i
am
for
the
case
in
question
thanks
monsieur
but
your
old
friends
of
the
musketeers
i
have
been
i
confess
tempted
to
speak
of
the
thing
to
those
gentlemen
but
they
are
all
absent
from
their
houses
it
is
vexatious
for
i
know
none
more
bold
or
able
ah
then
it
appears
there
will
be
an
opposition
and
the
enterprise
will
be
disputed
oh
yes
planchet
yes
i
burn
to
know
the
details
monsieur
here
they
are
planchet
close
all
the
doors
tight
yes
monsieur
and
planchet
them
that
is
well
now
draw
near
planchet
obeyed
and
open
the
window
because
the
noise
of
the
and
the
carts
will
deafen
all
who
might
hear
us
planchet
opened
the
window
as
desired
and
the
gust
of
tumult
which
filled
the
chamber
with
cries
wheels
barkings
and
steps
deafened
d
artagnan
himself
as
he
had
wished
he
then
swallowed
a
glass
of
white
wine
and
began
in
these
terms
planchet
i
have
an
idea
ah
monsieur
i
recognize
you
so
well
in
that
replied
planchet
panting
with
emotion
chapter
xx
of
the
society
which
was
formed
in
the
rue
des
lombards
after
a
moment
s
silence
in
which
d
artagnan
appeared
to
be
collecting
not
one
idea
but
all
his
ideas
it
can
not
be
my
dear
planchet
said
he
that
you
have
not
heard
of
his
majesty
charles
of
england
alas
yes
monsieur
since
you
left
france
in
order
to
assist
him
and
that
in
spite
of
that
assistance
he
fell
and
was
near
dragging
you
down
in
his
fall
exactly
so
i
see
you
have
a
good
memory
planchet
peste
the
astonishing
thing
would
be
if
i
could
have
lost
that
memory
however
bad
it
might
have
been
when
one
has
heard
grimaud
who
you
know
is
not
given
to
talking
relate
how
the
head
of
king
charles
fell
how
you
sailed
the
half
of
a
night
in
a
scuttled
vessel
and
saw
floating
on
the
water
that
good
mordaunt
with
a
certain
dagger
buried
in
his
breast
one
is
not
very
likely
to
forget
such
things
and
yet
there
are
people
who
forget
them
planchet
yes
such
as
have
not
seen
them
or
have
not
heard
grimaud
relate
them
well
it
is
all
the
better
that
you
recollect
all
that
i
shall
only
have
to
remind
you
of
one
thing
and
that
is
that
charles
had
a
son
without
contradicting
you
monsieur
he
had
two
said
planchet
for
i
saw
the
second
one
in
paris
le
duke
of
york
one
day
as
he
was
going
to
the
palais
royal
and
i
was
told
that
he
was
not
the
eldest
son
of
charles
i
as
to
the
eldest
i
have
the
honor
of
knowing
him
by
name
but
not
personally
that
is
exactly
the
point
planchet
we
must
come
to
it
is
to
this
eldest
son
formerly
called
the
prince
of
wales
and
who
is
now
styled
charles
king
of
england
a
king
without
a
kingdom
monsieur
replied
planchet
sententiously
yes
planchet
and
you
may
add
an
unfortunate
prince
more
unfortunate
than
the
poorest
man
of
the
people
lost
in
the
worst
quarter
of
paris
planchet
made
a
gesture
full
of
that
sort
of
compassion
which
we
grant
to
strangers
with
whom
we
think
we
can
never
possibly
find
ourselves
in
contact
besides
he
did
not
see
in
this
operation
any
sign
of
the
commercial
idea
of
d
artagnan
and
it
was
in
this
idea
that
d
artagnan
who
was
from
habit
pretty
well
acquainted
with
men
and
things
had
principally
interested
planchet
i
am
come
to
our
business
this
young
prince
of
wales
a
king
without
a
kingdom
as
you
have
so
well
said
planchet
has
interested
me
i
d
artagnan
have
seen
him
begging
assistance
of
mazarin
who
is
a
miser
and
the
aid
of
louis
who
is
a
child
and
it
appeared
to
me
who
am
acquainted
with
such
things
that
in
the
intelligent
eye
of
the
fallen
king
in
the
nobility
of
his
whole
person
a
nobility
apparent
above
all
his
miseries
i
could
discern
the
stuff
of
a
man
and
the
heart
of
a
king
planchet
tacitly
approved
of
all
this
but
it
did
not
at
all
in
his
eyes
at
least
throw
any
light
upon
d
artagnan
s
idea
the
latter
continued
this
then
is
the
reasoning
which
i
made
with
myself
listen
attentively
planchet
for
we
are
coming
to
the
conclusion
i
am
listening
kings
are
not
so
thickly
sown
upon
the
earth
that
people
can
find
them
whenever
they
want
them
now
this
king
without
a
kingdom
is
in
my
opinion
a
grain
of
seed
which
will
blossom
in
some
season
or
other
provided
a
skillful
discreet
and
vigorous
hand
sow
it
duly
and
truly
selecting
soil
sky
and
time
planchet
still
approved
by
a
nod
of
his
head
which
showed
that
he
did
not
perfectly
comprehend
all
that
was
said
poor
little
seed
of
a
king
said
i
to
myself
and
really
i
was
affected
planchet
which
leads
me
to
think
i
am
entering
upon
a
foolish
business
and
that
is
why
i
wished
to
consult
you
my
friend
planchet
colored
with
pleasure
and
pride
poor
little
seed
of
a
king
i
will
pick
you
up
and
cast
you
into
good
good
god
said
planchet
looking
earnestly
at
his
old
master
as
if
in
doubt
as
to
the
state
of
his
reason
well
what
is
it
said
d
artagnan
who
hurts
you
me
nothing
monsieur
you
said
good
god
did
i
i
am
sure
you
did
can
you
already
understand
i
confess
d
artagnan
that
i
am
afraid
to
understand
yes
to
understand
that
i
wish
to
replace
upon
his
throne
this
king
charles
who
has
no
throne
is
that
it
planchet
made
a
prodigious
bound
in
his
chair
ah
ah
said
he
in
evident
terror
that
is
what
you
call
a
restoration
yes
planchet
is
it
not
the
proper
term
for
it
oh
no
doubt
no
doubt
but
have
you
reflected
seriously
upon
what
upon
what
is
going
on
yonder
where
in
england
and
what
is
that
let
us
see
planchet
in
the
first
place
monsieur
i
ask
you
pardon
for
meddling
in
these
things
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
trade
but
since
it
is
an
affair
that
you
propose
to
me
for
you
are
proposing
an
affair
are
you
not
a
superb
one
planchet
but
as
it
is
business
you
propose
to
me
i
have
the
right
to
discuss
it
discuss
it
planchet
out
of
discussion
is
born
light
well
then
since
i
have
monsieur
s
permission
i
will
tell
him
that
there
is
yonder
in
the
first
place
the
parliament
well
next
and
then
the
army
good
do
you
see
anything
else
why
then
the
nation
is
that
all
the
nation
which
consented
to
the
overthrow
and
death
of
the
late
king
the
father
of
this
one
and
which
will
not
be
willing
to
belie
its
acts
planchet
said
d
artagnan
you
argue
like
a
cheese
the
nation
the
nation
is
tired
of
these
gentlemen
who
give
themselves
such
barbarous
names
and
who
sing
songs
to
it
chanting
for
chanting
my
dear
planchet
i
have
remarked
that
nations
prefer
singing
a
merry
chant
to
the
plain
chant
remember
the
fronde
what
did
they
sing
in
those
times
well
those
were
good
times
not
too
good
not
too
good
i
was
near
being
hung
in
those
times
well
but
you
were
not
no
and
you
laid
the
foundations
of
your
fortune
in
the
midst
of
all
those
songs
that
is
true
then
you
have
nothing
to
say
against
them
well
i
return
then
to
the
army
and
parliament
i
say
that
i
borrow
twenty
thousand
livres
of
planchet
and
that
i
put
twenty
thousand
livres
of
my
own
to
it
and
with
these
forty
thousand
livres
i
raise
an
army
planchet
clasped
his
hands
he
saw
that
d
artagnan
was
in
earnest
and
in
good
truth
he
believed
his
master
had
lost
his
senses
an
army
ah
monsieur
said
he
with
his
most
agreeable
smile
for
fear
of
irritating
the
madman
and
rendering
him
furious
an
army
how
many
of
forty
men
said
d
artagnan
forty
against
forty
thousand
that
is
not
enough
i
know
very
well
that
you
d
artagnan
alone
are
equal
to
a
thousand
men
but
where
are
we
to
find
men
equal
to
you
or
if
we
could
find
them
who
would
furnish
you
with
money
to
pay
them
not
bad
planchet
ah
the
devil
you
play
the
courtier
no
monsieur
i
speak
what
i
think
and
that
is
exactly
why
i
say
that
in
the
first
pitched
battle
you
fight
with
your
forty
men
i
am
very
much
afraid
therefore
i
shall
fight
no
pitched
battles
my
dear
planchet
said
the
gascon
laughing
we
have
very
fine
examples
in
antiquity
of
skillful
retreats
and
marches
which
consisted
in
avoiding
the
enemy
instead
of
attacking
them
you
should
know
that
planchet
you
who
commanded
the
parisians
the
day
on
which
they
ought
to
have
fought
against
the
musketeers
and
who
so
well
calculated
marches
and
countermarches
that
you
never
left
the
palais
royal
planchet
could
not
help
laughing
it
is
plain
replied
he
that
if
your
forty
men
conceal
themselves
and
are
not
unskillful
they
may
hope
not
to
be
beaten
but
you
propose
obtaining
some
result
do
you
not
no
doubt
this
then
in
my
opinion
is
the
plan
to
be
proceeded
upon
in
order
quickly
to
replace
his
majesty
charles
ii
on
his
throne
good
said
planchet
increasing
his
attention
let
us
see
your
plan
but
in
the
first
place
it
seems
to
me
we
are
forgetting
something
what
is
that
we
have
set
aside
the
nation
which
prefers
singing
merry
songs
to
psalms
and
the
army
which
we
will
not
fight
but
the
parliament
remains
and
that
seldom
sings
nor
does
it
fight
how
is
it
planchet
that
an
intelligent
man
like
yourself
should
take
any
heed
of
a
set
of
brawlers
who
call
themselves
rumps
and
barebones
the
parliament
does
not
trouble
me
at
all
planchet
as
soon
as
it
ceases
to
trouble
you
monsieur
let
us
pass
on
yes
and
arrive
at
the
result
you
remember
cromwell
planchet
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
him
he
was
a
rough
soldier
and
a
terrible
eater
moreover
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
at
one
gulp
he
swallowed
all
england
well
planchet
the
evening
before
the
day
on
which
he
swallowed
england
if
any
one
had
swallowed
m
cromwell
oh
monsieur
it
is
one
of
the
axioms
of
mathematics
that
the
container
must
be
greater
than
the
contained
very
well
that
is
our
affair
planchet
but
cromwell
is
dead
and
his
container
is
now
the
tomb
my
dear
planchet
i
see
with
pleasure
that
you
have
not
only
become
a
mathematician
but
a
philosopher
monsieur
in
my
grocery
business
i
use
much
printed
paper
and
that
instructs
me
bravo
you
know
then
in
that
case
for
you
have
not
learnt
mathematics
and
philosophy
without
a
little
history
that
after
this
cromwell
so
great
there
came
one
who
was
very
little
yes
he
was
named
richard
and
he
as
done
as
you
have
d
artagnan
he
has
tendered
his
resignation
very
well
said
very
well
after
the
great
man
who
is
dead
after
the
little
one
who
tendered
his
resignation
there
came
a
third
this
one
is
named
monk
he
is
an
able
general
considering
he
has
never
fought
a
battle
he
is
a
skillful
diplomatist
considering
that
he
never
speaks
in
public
and
that
having
to
say
to
a
man
he
meditates
twelve
hours
and
ends
by
saying
good
night
which
makes
people
exclaim
miracle
seeing
that
it
falls
out
correctly
that
is
rather
strong
said
planchet
but
i
know
another
political
man
who
resembles
him
very
much
mazarin
you
mean
himself
you
are
right
planchet
only
mazarin
does
not
aspire
to
the
throne
of
france
and
that
changes
everything
do
you
see
well
this
monk
who
has
england
in
his
plate
and
who
is
already
opening
his
mouth
to
swallow
it
this
monk
who
says
to
the
people
of
charles
and
to
charles
ii
himself
nescio
vos
i
don
t
understand
english
said
planchet
yes
but
i
understand
it
said
d
artagnan
nescio
vos
means
i
do
not
know
this
monk
the
most
important
man
in
england
when
he
shall
have
swallowed
it
well
asked
planchet
well
my
friend
i
shall
go
over
yonder
and
with
my
forty
men
i
shall
carry
him
off
pack
him
up
and
bring
him
into
france
where
two
modes
of
proceeding
present
themselves
to
my
dazzled
eyes
oh
and
to
mine
too
cried
planchet
transported
with
enthusiasm
we
will
put
him
in
a
cage
and
show
him
for
money
well
planchet
that
is
a
third
plan
of
which
i
had
not
thought
do
you
think
it
a
good
one
yes
certainly
but
i
think
mine
better
let
us
see
yours
then
in
the
first
place
i
shall
set
a
ransom
on
him
of
how
much
peste
a
fellow
like
that
must
be
well
worth
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
yes
yes
you
see
then
in
the
first
place
a
ransom
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
or
else
or
else
what
is
much
better
i
deliver
him
up
to
king
charles
who
having
no
longer
either
a
general
or
an
army
to
fear
nor
a
diplomatist
to
trick
him
will
restore
himself
and
when
once
restored
will
pay
down
to
me
the
hundred
thousand
crowns
in
question
that
is
the
idea
i
have
formed
what
do
you
say
to
it
planchet
magnificent
monsieur
cried
planchet
trembling
with
emotion
how
did
you
conceive
that
idea
it
came
to
me
one
morning
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
whilst
our
beloved
king
louis
was
pretending
to
weep
upon
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
de
mancini
monsieur
i
declare
the
idea
is
sublime
but
ah
is
there
a
but
permit
me
but
this
is
a
little
like
the
skin
of
that
fine
bear
you
know
that
they
were
about
to
sell
but
which
it
was
necessary
to
take
from
the
back
of
the
living
bear
now
to
take
monk
there
will
be
a
bit
of
a
scuffle
i
should
think
no
doubt
but
as
i
shall
raise
an
army
to
yes
yes
i
understand
parbleu
a
yes
then
monsieur
you
will
triumph
for
no
one
equals
you
in
such
sorts
of
encounters
i
certainly
am
lucky
in
them
said
d
artagnan
with
a
proud
simplicity
you
know
that
if
for
this
affair
i
had
my
dear
athos
my
brave
porthos
and
my
cunning
aramis
the
business
would
be
settled
but
they
are
all
lost
as
it
appears
and
nobody
knows
where
to
find
them
i
will
do
it
then
alone
now
do
you
find
the
business
good
and
the
investment
advantageous
too
much
so
too
much
so
how
can
that
be
because
fine
things
never
reach
the
expected
point
this
is
infallible
planchet
and
the
proof
is
that
i
undertake
it
it
will
be
for
you
a
tolerably
pretty
gain
and
for
me
a
very
interesting
stroke
it
will
be
said
such
was
the
old
age
of
d
artagnan
and
i
shall
hold
a
place
in
tales
and
even
in
history
itself
planchet
i
am
greedy
of
honor
monsieur
cried
planchet
when
i
think
that
it
is
here
in
my
home
in
the
midst
of
my
sugar
my
prunes
and
my
cinnamon
that
this
gigantic
project
is
ripened
my
shop
seems
a
palace
to
me
beware
beware
planchet
if
the
least
report
of
this
escapes
there
is
the
bastile
for
both
of
us
beware
my
friend
for
this
is
a
plot
we
are
hatching
monk
is
the
ally
of
m
mazarin
beware
monsieur
when
a
man
has
had
the
honor
to
belong
to
you
he
knows
nothing
of
fear
and
when
he
has
had
the
advantage
of
being
bound
up
in
interests
with
you
he
holds
his
tongue
very
well
that
is
more
your
affair
than
mine
seeing
that
in
a
week
i
shall
be
in
england
depart
monsieur
depart
the
sooner
the
better
is
the
money
then
ready
it
will
be
you
shall
receive
it
from
my
own
hands
will
you
have
gold
or
silver
gold
that
is
most
convenient
but
how
are
we
going
to
arrange
this
let
us
see
oh
good
lord
in
the
simplest
way
possible
you
shall
give
me
a
receipt
that
is
all
no
no
said
d
artagnan
warmly
we
must
preserve
order
in
all
things
that
is
likewise
my
opinion
but
with
you
d
artagnan
and
if
i
should
die
yonder
if
i
should
be
killed
by
a
if
i
should
burst
from
drinking
beer
monsieur
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
in
that
case
i
should
be
so
much
afflicted
at
your
death
that
i
should
not
think
about
the
money
thank
you
planchet
but
no
matter
we
shall
like
two
lawyers
clerks
draw
up
together
an
agreement
a
sort
of
act
which
may
be
called
a
deed
of
company
willingly
monsieur
i
know
it
is
difficult
to
draw
such
a
thing
up
but
we
can
try
let
us
try
then
and
planchet
went
in
search
of
pens
ink
and
paper
d
artagnan
took
the
pen
and
wrote
between
messire
d
artagnan
of
the
king
s
musketeers
at
present
residing
in
the
rue
tiquetonne
hotel
de
la
chevrette
and
the
sieur
planchet
grocer
residing
in
the
rue
des
lombards
at
the
sign
of
the
pilon
d
or
it
has
been
agreed
as
follows
a
company
with
a
capital
of
forty
thousand
livres
and
formed
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
an
idea
conceived
by
d
artagnan
and
the
said
planchet
approving
of
it
in
all
points
will
place
twenty
thousand
livres
in
the
hands
of
d
artagnan
he
will
require
neither
repayment
nor
interest
before
the
return
of
d
artagnan
from
a
journey
he
is
about
to
take
into
england
on
his
part
d
artagnan
undertakes
it
to
find
twenty
thousand
livres
which
he
will
join
to
the
twenty
thousand
already
laid
down
by
the
sieur
planchet
he
will
employ
the
said
sum
of
forty
thousand
livres
according
to
his
judgment
in
an
undertaking
which
is
described
below
on
the
day
when
d
artagnan
shall
have
by
whatever
means
his
majesty
king
charles
ii
upon
the
throne
of
england
he
will
pay
into
the
hands
of
planchet
the
sum
of
the
sum
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
said
planchet
innocently
perceiving
that
d
artagnan
hesitated
oh
the
devil
no
said
d
artagnan
the
division
can
not
be
made
by
half
that
would
not
be
just
and
yet
monsieur
we
each
lay
down
half
objected
planchet
timidly
yes
but
listen
to
this
clause
my
dear
planchet
and
if
you
do
not
find
if
equitable
in
every
respect
when
it
is
written
well
we
can
scratch
it
out
again
nevertheless
as
d
artagnan
brings
to
the
association
besides
his
capital
of
twenty
thousand
livres
his
time
his
idea
his
industry
and
his
skin
things
which
he
appreciates
strongly
particularly
the
last
d
artagnan
will
keep
of
the
three
hundred
thousand
livres
two
hundred
thousand
livres
for
himself
which
will
make
his
share
very
well
said
planchet
is
it
just
asked
d
artagnan
perfectly
just
monsieur
and
you
will
be
contented
with
a
hundred
thousand
livres
peste
i
think
so
a
hundred
thousand
for
twenty
thousand
and
in
a
month
understand
how
in
a
month
yes
i
only
ask
one
month
monsieur
said
planchet
generously
i
give
you
six
weeks
thank
you
replied
the
musketeer
politely
after
which
the
two
partners
reperused
their
deed
that
is
perfect
monsieur
said
planchet
and
the
late
coquenard
the
first
husband
of
madame
la
baronne
du
vallon
could
not
have
done
it
better
do
you
find
it
so
let
us
sign
it
then
and
both
affixed
their
signatures
in
this
fashion
said
d
artagnan
i
shall
be
under
obligations
to
no
one
but
i
shall
be
under
obligations
to
you
said
planchet
no
for
whatever
store
i
set
by
it
planchet
i
may
lose
my
skin
yonder
and
you
will
lose
all
a
propos
peste
that
makes
me
think
of
the
principal
an
indispensable
clause
i
shall
write
it
in
case
of
d
artagnan
dying
in
this
enterprise
liquidation
will
be
considered
made
and
the
sieur
planchet
will
give
quittance
from
that
moment
to
the
shade
of
messire
d
artagnan
for
the
twenty
thousand
livres
paid
by
him
into
the
hands
of
the
said
this
last
clause
made
planchet
knit
his
brows
a
little
but
when
he
saw
the
brilliant
eye
the
muscular
hand
the
supple
and
strong
back
of
his
associate
he
regained
his
courage
and
without
regret
he
at
once
added
another
stroke
to
his
signature
d
artagnan
did
the
same
thus
was
drawn
the
first
known
company
contract
perhaps
such
things
have
been
abused
a
little
since
both
in
form
and
principle
now
said
planchet
pouring
out
the
last
glass
of
anjou
wine
for
d
artagnan
now
go
to
sleep
my
dear
master
no
replied
d
artagnan
for
the
most
difficult
part
now
remains
to
be
done
and
i
will
think
over
that
difficult
part
bah
said
planchet
i
have
such
great
confidence
in
you
d
artagnan
that
i
would
not
give
my
hundred
thousand
livres
for
ninety
thousand
livres
down
and
devil
take
me
if
i
don
t
think
you
are
right
upon
which
d
artagnan
took
a
candle
and
went
up
to
his
bedroom
chapter
xxi
in
which
d
artagnan
prepares
to
travel
d
artagnan
reflected
to
such
good
purpose
during
the
night
that
his
plan
was
settled
by
morning
this
is
it
said
he
sitting
up
in
bed
supporting
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
chin
in
his
hand
this
is
it
i
shall
seek
out
forty
steady
firm
men
recruited
among
people
a
little
compromised
but
having
habits
of
discipline
i
shall
promise
them
five
hundred
livres
for
a
month
if
they
return
nothing
if
they
do
not
return
or
half
for
their
kindred
as
to
food
and
lodging
that
concerns
the
english
who
have
cattle
in
their
pastures
bacon
in
their
fowls
in
their
and
corn
in
their
barns
i
will
present
myself
to
general
monk
with
my
little
body
of
troops
he
will
receive
me
i
shall
win
his
confidence
and
take
advantage
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
but
without
going
further
d
artagnan
shook
his
head
and
interrupted
himself
no
said
he
i
should
not
dare
to
relate
this
to
athos
the
way
is
therefore
not
honorable
i
must
use
violence
continued
he
very
certainly
i
must
but
without
compromising
my
loyalty
with
forty
men
i
will
traverse
the
country
as
a
partisan
but
if
i
fall
in
with
not
forty
thousand
english
as
planchet
said
but
purely
and
simply
with
four
hundred
i
shall
be
beaten
supposing
that
among
my
forty
warriors
there
should
be
found
at
least
ten
stupid
ones
ten
who
will
allow
themselves
to
be
killed
one
after
the
other
from
mere
folly
no
it
is
in
fact
impossible
to
find
forty
men
to
be
depended
upon
they
do
not
exist
i
must
learn
how
to
be
contented
with
thirty
with
ten
men
less
i
should
have
the
right
of
avoiding
any
armed
encounter
on
account
of
the
small
number
of
my
people
and
if
the
encounter
should
take
place
my
chance
is
better
with
thirty
men
than
forty
besides
i
should
save
five
thousand
francs
that
is
to
say
the
eighth
of
my
capital
that
is
worth
the
trial
this
being
so
i
should
have
thirty
men
i
shall
divide
them
into
three
bands
we
will
spread
ourselves
about
over
the
country
with
an
injunction
to
reunite
at
a
given
moment
in
this
fashion
ten
by
ten
we
should
excite
no
suspicion
we
should
pass
unperceived
yes
yes
thirty
that
is
a
magic
number
there
are
three
tens
three
that
divine
number
and
then
truly
a
company
of
thirty
men
when
all
together
will
look
rather
imposing
ah
stupid
wretch
that
i
am
continued
d
artagnan
i
want
thirty
horses
that
is
ruinous
where
the
devil
was
my
head
when
i
forgot
the
horses
we
can
not
however
think
of
striking
such
a
blow
without
horses
well
so
be
it
that
sacrifice
must
be
made
we
can
get
the
horses
in
the
country
they
are
not
bad
besides
but
i
forgot
peste
three
bands
that
necessitates
three
leaders
there
is
the
difficulty
of
the
three
commanders
i
have
already
one
that
is
myself
yes
but
the
two
others
will
of
themselves
cost
almost
as
much
money
as
all
the
rest
of
the
troop
no
positively
i
must
have
but
one
lieutenant
in
that
case
then
i
should
reduce
my
troop
to
twenty
men
i
know
very
well
that
twenty
men
is
but
very
little
but
since
with
thirty
i
was
determined
not
to
seek
to
come
to
blows
i
should
do
so
more
carefully
still
with
twenty
twenty
that
is
a
round
number
that
besides
reduces
the
number
of
the
horses
by
ten
which
is
a
consideration
and
then
with
a
good
lieutenant
mordioux
what
things
patience
and
calculation
are
was
i
not
going
to
embark
with
forty
men
and
i
have
now
reduced
them
to
twenty
for
an
equal
success
ten
thousand
livres
saved
at
one
stroke
and
more
safety
that
is
well
now
then
let
us
see
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
find
this
lieutenant
let
him
be
found
then
and
after
that
is
not
so
easy
he
must
be
brave
and
good
a
second
myself
yes
but
a
lieutenant
must
have
my
secret
and
as
that
secret
is
worth
a
million
and
i
shall
only
pay
my
man
a
thousand
livres
fifteen
hundred
at
the
most
my
man
will
sell
the
secret
to
monk
mordioux
no
lieutenant
besides
this
man
were
he
as
mute
as
a
disciple
of
pythagoras
this
man
would
be
sure
to
have
in
the
troop
some
favorite
soldier
whom
he
would
make
his
sergeant
the
sergeant
would
penetrate
the
secret
of
the
lieutenant
in
case
the
latter
should
be
honest
and
unwilling
to
sell
it
then
the
sergeant
less
honest
and
less
ambitious
will
give
up
the
whole
for
fifty
thousand
livres
come
come
that
is
impossible
the
lieutenant
is
impossible
but
then
i
must
have
no
fractions
i
can
not
divide
my
troop
in
two
and
act
upon
two
points
at
once
without
another
self
who
but
what
is
the
use
of
acting
upon
two
points
as
we
have
only
one
man
to
take
what
can
be
the
use
of
weakening
a
corps
by
placing
the
right
here
and
the
left
there
a
single
corps
mordioux
a
single
one
and
that
commanded
by
d
artagnan
very
well
but
twenty
men
marching
in
one
band
are
suspected
by
everybody
twenty
horsemen
must
not
be
seen
marching
together
or
a
company
will
be
detached
against
them
and
the
password
will
be
required
the
which
company
upon
seeing
them
embarrassed
to
give
it
would
shoot
d
artagnan
and
his
men
like
so
many
rabbits
i
reduce
myself
then
to
ten
men
in
this
fashion
i
shall
act
simply
and
with
unity
i
shall
be
forced
to
be
prudent
which
is
half
the
success
in
an
affair
of
the
kind
i
am
undertaking
a
greater
number
might
perhaps
have
drawn
me
into
some
folly
ten
horses
are
not
many
either
to
buy
or
take
a
capital
idea
what
tranquillity
it
infuses
into
my
mind
no
more
suspicions
no
passwords
no
more
dangers
ten
men
they
are
valets
or
clerks
ten
men
leading
ten
horses
laden
with
merchandise
of
whatever
kind
are
tolerated
well
received
everywhere
ten
men
travel
on
account
of
the
house
of
planchet
of
france
nothing
can
be
said
against
that
these
ten
men
clothed
like
manufacturers
have
a
good
cutlass
or
a
good
musket
at
their
and
a
good
pistol
in
the
holster
they
never
allow
themselves
to
be
uneasy
because
they
have
no
evil
designs
they
are
perhaps
in
truth
a
little
disposed
to
be
smugglers
but
what
harm
is
in
that
smuggling
is
not
like
polygamy
a
hanging
offense
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
us
is
the
confiscation
of
our
merchandise
our
merchandise
confiscated
a
fine
affair
that
come
come
it
is
a
superb
plan
ten
men
only
ten
men
whom
i
will
engage
for
my
service
ten
men
who
shall
be
as
resolute
as
forty
who
would
cost
me
four
times
as
much
and
to
whom
for
greater
security
i
will
never
open
my
mouth
as
to
my
designs
and
to
whom
i
shall
only
say
my
friends
there
is
a
blow
to
be
things
being
after
this
fashion
satan
will
be
very
malicious
if
he
plays
me
one
of
his
tricks
fifteen
thousand
livres
saved
that
s
superb
out
of
twenty
thus
fortified
by
his
laborious
calculations
d
artagnan
stopped
at
this
plan
and
determined
to
change
nothing
in
it
he
had
already
on
a
list
furnished
by
his
inexhaustible
memory
ten
men
illustrious
amongst
the
seekers
of
adventure
by
fortune
and
not
on
good
terms
with
justice
upon
this
d
artagnan
rose
and
instantly
set
off
on
the
search
telling
planchet
not
to
expect
him
to
breakfast
and
perhaps
not
to
dinner
a
day
and
a
half
spent
in
rummaging
amongst
certain
dens
of
paris
sufficed
for
his
recruiting
and
without
allowing
his
adventurers
to
communicate
with
each
other
he
had
picked
up
and
got
together
in
less
than
thirty
hours
a
charming
collection
of
faces
speaking
a
french
less
pure
than
the
english
they
were
about
to
attempt
these
men
were
for
the
most
part
guards
whose
merit
d
artagnan
had
had
an
opportunity
of
appreciating
in
various
encounters
whom
drunkenness
unlucky
unexpected
winnings
at
play
or
the
economical
reforms
of
mazarin
had
forced
to
seek
shade
and
solitude
those
two
great
consolers
of
irritated
and
chafing
spirits
they
bore
upon
their
countenances
and
in
their
vestments
the
traces
of
the
heartaches
they
had
undergone
some
had
their
visages
scarred
all
had
their
clothes
in
rags
d
artagnan
comforted
the
most
needy
of
these
brotherly
miseries
by
a
prudent
distribution
of
the
crowns
of
the
company
then
having
taken
care
that
these
crowns
should
be
employed
in
the
physical
improvement
of
the
troop
he
appointed
a
trysting
place
in
the
north
of
france
between
bergues
and
saint
omer
six
days
were
allowed
as
the
utmost
term
and
d
artagnan
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
the
and
the
relative
probity
of
these
illustrious
recruits
to
be
certain
that
not
one
of
them
would
fail
in
his
appointment
these
orders
given
this
rendezvous
fixed
he
went
to
bid
farewell
to
planchet
who
asked
news
of
his
army
d
artagnan
did
not
think
it
proper
to
inform
him
of
the
reduction
he
had
made
in
his
personnel
he
feared
that
the
confidence
of
his
associate
would
be
abated
by
such
an
avowal
planchet
was
delighted
to
learn
that
the
army
was
levied
and
that
he
planchet
found
himself
a
kind
of
half
king
who
from
his
kept
in
pay
a
body
of
troops
destined
to
make
war
against
perfidious
albion
that
enemy
of
all
true
french
hearts
planchet
paid
down
in
double
louis
twenty
thousand
livres
to
d
artagnan
on
the
part
of
himself
planchet
and
twenty
thousand
livres
still
in
double
louis
in
account
with
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
placed
each
of
the
twenty
thousand
francs
in
a
bag
and
weighing
a
bag
in
each
hand
this
money
is
very
embarrassing
my
dear
planchet
said
he
do
you
know
this
weighs
thirty
pounds
bah
your
horse
will
carry
that
like
a
feather
d
artagnan
shook
his
head
don
t
tell
me
such
things
planchet
a
horse
overloaded
with
thirty
pounds
in
addition
to
the
rider
and
his
portmanteau
can
not
cross
a
river
so
easily
can
not
leap
over
a
wall
or
ditch
so
lightly
and
the
horse
failing
the
horseman
fails
it
is
true
that
you
planchet
who
have
served
in
the
infantry
may
not
be
aware
of
all
that
then
what
is
to
be
done
monsieur
said
planchet
greatly
embarrassed
listen
to
me
said
d
artagnan
i
will
pay
my
army
on
its
return
home
keep
my
half
of
twenty
thousand
livres
which
you
can
use
during
that
time
and
my
half
said
planchet
i
shall
take
that
with
me
your
confidence
does
me
honor
said
planchet
but
supposing
you
should
not
return
that
is
possible
though
not
very
probable
then
planchet
in
case
i
should
not
return
give
me
a
pen
i
will
make
my
will
d
artagnan
took
a
pen
and
some
paper
and
wrote
upon
a
plain
sheet
i
d
artagnan
possess
twenty
thousand
livres
laid
up
cent
per
cent
during
thirty
years
that
i
have
been
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
france
i
leave
five
thousand
to
athos
five
thousand
to
porthos
and
five
thousand
to
aramis
that
they
may
give
the
said
sums
in
my
name
and
their
own
to
my
young
friend
raoul
vicomte
de
bragelonne
i
give
the
remaining
five
thousand
to
planchet
that
he
may
distribute
the
fifteen
thousand
with
less
regret
among
my
friends
with
which
purpose
i
sign
these
d
artagnan
planchet
appeared
very
curious
to
know
what
d
artagnan
had
written
here
said
the
musketeer
read
it
on
reading
the
last
lines
the
tears
came
into
planchet
s
eyes
you
think
then
that
i
would
not
have
given
the
money
without
that
then
i
will
have
none
of
your
five
thousand
francs
d
artagnan
smiled
accept
it
accept
it
planchet
and
in
that
way
you
will
only
lose
fifteen
thousand
francs
instead
of
twenty
thousand
and
you
will
not
be
tempted
to
disregard
the
signature
of
your
master
and
friend
by
losing
nothing
at
all
how
well
that
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
knew
the
hearts
of
men
and
grocers
they
who
have
pronounced
don
quixote
mad
because
he
rode
out
to
the
conquest
of
an
empire
with
nobody
but
sancho
his
squire
and
they
who
have
pronounced
sancho
mad
because
he
accompanied
his
master
in
his
attempt
to
conquer
the
said
empire
they
certainly
will
have
no
hesitation
in
extending
the
same
judgment
to
d
artagnan
and
planchet
and
yet
the
first
passed
for
one
of
the
most
subtle
spirits
among
the
astute
spirits
of
the
court
of
france
as
to
the
second
he
had
acquired
by
good
right
the
reputation
of
having
one
of
the
longest
heads
among
the
grocers
of
the
rue
des
lombards
consequently
of
paris
and
consequently
of
france
now
to
consider
these
two
men
from
the
point
of
view
from
which
you
would
consider
other
men
and
the
means
by
the
aid
of
which
they
contemplated
to
restore
a
monarch
to
his
throne
compared
with
other
means
the
shallowest
brains
of
the
country
where
brains
are
most
shallow
must
have
revolted
against
the
presumptuous
madness
of
the
lieutenant
and
the
stupidity
of
his
associate
fortunately
d
artagnan
was
not
a
man
to
listen
to
the
idle
talk
of
those
around
him
or
to
the
comments
that
were
made
on
himself
he
had
adopted
the
motto
act
well
and
let
people
talk
planchet
on
his
part
had
adopted
this
act
and
say
nothing
it
resulted
from
this
that
according
to
the
custom
of
all
superior
geniuses
these
two
men
flattered
themselves
intra
pectus
with
being
in
the
right
against
all
who
found
fault
with
them
as
a
beginning
d
artagnan
set
out
in
the
finest
of
possible
weather
without
a
cloud
in
the
heavens
without
a
cloud
on
his
mind
joyous
and
strong
calm
and
decided
great
in
his
resolution
and
consequently
carrying
with
him
a
tenfold
dose
of
that
potent
fluid
which
the
shocks
of
mind
cause
to
spring
from
the
nerves
and
which
procure
for
the
human
machine
a
force
and
an
influence
of
which
future
ages
will
render
according
to
all
probability
a
more
arithmetical
account
than
we
can
possibly
do
at
present
he
was
again
as
in
times
past
on
that
same
road
of
adventures
which
had
led
him
to
boulogne
and
which
he
was
now
traveling
for
the
fourth
time
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
could
almost
recognize
the
trace
of
his
own
steps
upon
the
road
and
that
of
his
fist
upon
the
doors
of
the
hostelries
his
memory
always
active
and
present
brought
back
that
youth
which
neither
thirty
years
later
his
great
heart
nor
his
wrist
of
steel
would
have
belied
what
a
rich
nature
was
that
of
this
man
he
had
all
the
passions
all
the
defects
all
the
weaknesses
and
the
spirit
of
contradiction
familiar
to
his
understanding
changed
all
these
imperfections
into
corresponding
qualities
d
artagnan
thanks
to
his
ever
active
imagination
was
afraid
of
a
shadow
and
ashamed
of
being
afraid
he
marched
straight
up
to
that
shadow
and
then
became
extravagant
in
his
bravery
if
the
danger
proved
to
be
real
thus
everything
in
him
was
emotion
and
therefore
enjoyment
he
loved
the
society
of
others
but
never
became
tired
of
his
own
and
more
than
once
if
he
could
have
been
heard
when
he
was
alone
he
might
have
been
seen
laughing
at
the
jokes
he
related
to
himself
or
the
tricks
his
imagination
created
just
five
minutes
before
ennui
might
have
been
looked
for
d
artagnan
was
not
perhaps
so
gay
this
time
as
he
would
have
been
with
the
prospect
of
finding
some
good
friends
at
calais
instead
of
joining
the
ten
scamps
there
melancholy
however
did
not
visit
him
more
than
once
a
day
and
it
was
about
five
visits
that
he
received
from
that
somber
deity
before
he
got
sight
of
the
sea
at
boulogne
and
then
these
visits
were
indeed
but
short
but
when
once
d
artagnan
found
himself
near
the
field
of
action
all
other
feelings
but
that
of
confidence
disappeared
never
to
return
from
boulogne
he
followed
the
coast
to
calais
calais
was
the
place
of
general
rendezvous
and
at
calais
he
had
named
to
each
of
his
recruits
the
hostelry
of
le
grande
monarque
where
living
was
not
extravagant
where
sailors
messed
and
where
men
of
the
sword
with
sheath
of
leather
be
it
understood
found
lodging
table
food
and
all
the
comforts
of
life
for
thirty
sous
per
diem
d
artagnan
proposed
to
himself
to
take
them
by
surprise
in
flagrante
delicto
of
wandering
life
and
to
judge
by
the
first
appearance
if
he
could
count
on
them
as
trusty
companions
he
arrived
at
calais
at
half
past
four
in
the
afternoon
chapter
xxii
d
artagnan
travels
for
the
house
of
planchet
and
company
the
hostelry
of
le
grand
monarque
was
situated
in
a
little
street
parallel
to
the
port
without
looking
out
upon
the
port
itself
some
lanes
cut
as
steps
cut
the
two
parallels
of
the
ladder
the
two
great
straight
lines
of
the
port
and
the
street
by
these
lanes
passengers
came
suddenly
from
the
port
into
the
street
or
from
the
street
on
to
the
port
d
artagnan
arrived
at
the
port
took
one
of
these
lanes
and
came
out
in
front
of
the
hostelry
of
le
grand
monarque
the
moment
was
well
chosen
and
might
remind
d
artagnan
of
his
start
in
life
at
the
hostelry
of
the
at
meung
some
sailors
who
had
been
playing
at
dice
had
started
a
quarrel
and
were
threatening
each
other
furiously
the
host
hostess
and
two
lads
were
watching
with
anxiety
the
circle
of
these
angry
gamblers
from
the
midst
of
which
war
seemed
ready
to
break
forth
bristling
with
knives
and
hatchets
the
play
nevertheless
was
continued
a
stone
bench
was
occupied
by
two
men
who
appeared
thence
to
watch
the
door
four
tables
placed
at
the
back
of
the
common
chamber
were
occupied
by
eight
other
individuals
neither
the
men
at
the
door
nor
those
at
the
tables
took
any
part
in
the
play
or
the
quarrel
d
artagnan
recognized
his
ten
men
in
these
cold
indifferent
spectators
the
quarrel
went
on
increasing
every
passion
has
like
the
sea
its
tide
which
ascends
and
descends
reaching
the
climax
of
passion
one
sailor
overturned
the
table
and
the
money
which
was
upon
it
the
table
fell
and
the
money
rolled
about
in
an
instant
all
belonging
to
the
hostelry
threw
themselves
upon
the
stakes
and
many
a
piece
of
silver
was
picked
up
by
people
who
stole
away
whilst
the
sailors
were
scuffling
with
each
other
the
two
men
on
the
bench
and
the
eight
at
the
tables
although
they
seemed
perfect
strangers
to
each
other
these
ten
men
alone
we
say
appeared
to
have
agreed
to
remain
impassible
amidst
the
cries
of
fury
and
the
chinking
of
money
two
only
contented
themselves
with
pushing
with
their
feet
combatants
who
came
under
their
table
two
others
rather
than
take
part
in
this
disturbance
buried
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
another
two
jumped
upon
the
table
they
occupied
as
people
do
to
avoid
being
submerged
by
overflowing
water
come
come
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
not
having
lost
one
of
the
details
we
have
related
this
is
a
very
fair
gathering
circumspect
calm
accustomed
to
disturbance
acquainted
with
blows
peste
i
have
been
lucky
all
at
once
his
attention
was
called
to
a
particular
part
of
the
room
the
two
men
who
had
pushed
the
strugglers
with
their
feet
were
assailed
with
abuse
by
the
sailors
who
had
become
reconciled
one
of
them
half
drunk
with
passion
and
quite
drunk
with
beer
came
in
a
menacing
manner
to
demand
of
the
shorter
of
these
two
sages
by
what
right
he
had
touched
with
his
foot
creatures
of
the
good
god
who
were
not
dogs
and
whilst
putting
this
question
in
order
to
make
it
more
direct
he
applied
his
great
fist
to
the
nose
of
d
artagnan
s
recruit
this
man
became
pale
without
its
being
to
be
discerned
whether
his
pallor
arose
from
anger
or
fear
seeing
which
the
sailor
concluded
it
was
from
fear
and
raised
his
fist
with
the
manifest
intention
of
letting
it
fall
upon
the
head
of
the
stranger
but
though
the
threatened
man
did
not
appear
to
move
he
dealt
the
sailor
such
a
severe
blow
in
the
stomach
that
he
sent
him
rolling
and
howling
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
at
the
same
instant
rallied
by
the
espirit
de
corps
all
the
comrades
of
the
conquered
man
fell
upon
the
conqueror
the
latter
with
the
same
coolness
of
which
he
had
given
proof
without
committing
the
imprudence
of
touching
his
weapons
took
up
a
with
a
and
knocked
down
two
or
three
of
his
assailants
then
as
he
was
about
to
yield
to
numbers
the
seven
other
silent
men
at
the
tables
who
had
not
yet
stirred
perceived
that
their
cause
was
at
stake
and
came
to
the
rescue
at
the
same
time
the
two
indifferent
spectators
at
the
door
turned
round
with
frowning
bows
indicating
their
evident
intention
of
taking
the
enemy
in
the
rear
if
the
enemy
did
not
cease
their
aggressions
the
host
his
helpers
and
two
watchmen
who
were
passing
and
who
from
the
curiosity
had
penetrated
too
far
into
the
room
were
mixed
up
in
the
tumult
and
showered
with
blows
the
parisians
hit
like
cyclops
with
an
ensemble
and
a
tactic
delightful
to
behold
at
length
obliged
to
beat
a
retreat
before
superior
numbers
they
formed
an
intrenchment
behind
the
large
table
which
they
raised
by
main
force
whilst
the
two
others
arming
themselves
each
with
a
trestle
and
using
it
like
a
great
knocked
down
at
a
blow
eight
sailors
upon
whose
heads
they
had
brought
their
monstrous
catapult
in
play
the
floor
was
already
strewn
with
wounded
and
the
room
filled
with
cries
and
dust
when
d
artagnan
satisfied
with
the
test
advanced
sword
in
hand
and
striking
with
the
pommel
every
head
that
came
in
his
way
he
uttered
a
vigorous
hola
which
put
an
instantaneous
end
to
the
conflict
a
great
directly
took
place
from
the
center
to
the
sides
of
the
room
so
that
d
artagnan
found
himself
isolated
and
dominator
what
is
this
all
about
then
demanded
he
of
the
assembly
with
the
majestic
tone
of
neptune
pronouncing
the
quos
ego
at
the
very
instant
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
to
carry
on
the
virgilian
metaphor
d
artagnan
s
recruits
recognizing
each
his
sovereign
lord
discontinued
their
and
trestle
blows
on
their
side
the
sailors
seeing
that
long
naked
sword
that
martial
air
and
the
agile
arm
which
came
to
the
rescue
of
their
enemies
in
the
person
of
a
man
who
seemed
accustomed
to
command
the
sailors
picked
up
their
wounded
and
their
pitchers
the
parisians
wiped
their
brows
and
viewed
their
leader
with
respect
d
artagnan
was
loaded
with
thanks
by
the
host
of
le
grand
monarque
he
received
them
like
a
man
who
knows
that
nothing
is
being
offered
that
does
not
belong
to
him
and
then
said
he
would
go
and
walk
upon
the
port
till
supper
was
ready
immediately
each
of
the
recruits
who
understood
the
summons
took
his
hat
brushed
the
dust
off
his
clothes
and
followed
d
artagnan
but
d
artagnan
whilst
walking
and
observing
took
care
not
to
stop
he
directed
his
course
towards
the
downs
and
the
ten
men
surprised
at
finding
themselves
going
in
the
track
of
each
other
uneasy
at
seeing
on
their
right
on
their
left
and
behind
them
companions
upon
whom
they
had
not
reckoned
followed
him
casting
furtive
glances
at
each
other
it
was
not
till
he
had
arrived
at
the
hollow
part
of
the
deepest
down
that
d
artagnan
smiling
to
see
them
outdone
turned
towards
them
making
a
friendly
sign
with
his
hand
eh
come
come
gentlemen
said
he
let
us
not
devour
each
other
you
are
made
to
live
together
to
understand
each
other
in
all
respects
and
not
to
devour
one
another
instantly
all
hesitation
ceased
the
men
breathed
as
if
they
had
been
taken
out
of
a
coffin
and
examined
each
other
complacently
after
this
examination
they
turned
their
eyes
towards
their
leader
who
had
long
been
acquainted
with
the
art
of
speaking
to
men
of
that
class
and
who
improvised
the
following
little
speech
pronounced
with
an
energy
truly
gascon
gentlemen
you
all
know
who
i
am
i
have
engaged
you
from
knowing
you
to
be
brave
and
willing
to
associate
you
with
me
in
a
glorious
enterprise
imagine
that
in
laboring
for
me
you
labor
for
the
king
i
only
warn
you
that
if
you
allow
anything
of
this
supposition
to
appear
i
shall
be
forced
to
crack
your
skulls
immediately
in
the
manner
most
convenient
to
me
you
are
not
ignorant
gentlemen
that
state
secrets
are
like
a
mortal
poison
as
long
as
that
poison
is
in
its
box
and
the
box
is
closed
it
is
not
injurious
out
of
the
box
it
kills
now
draw
near
and
you
shall
know
as
much
of
this
secret
as
i
am
able
to
tell
you
all
drew
close
to
him
with
an
expression
of
curiosity
approach
continued
d
artagnan
and
let
not
the
bird
which
passes
over
our
heads
the
rabbit
which
sports
on
the
downs
the
fish
which
bounds
from
the
waters
hear
us
our
business
is
to
learn
and
to
report
to
monsieur
le
surintendant
of
the
finances
to
what
extent
english
smuggling
is
injurious
to
the
french
merchants
i
shall
enter
every
place
and
see
everything
we
are
poor
picard
fishermen
thrown
upon
the
coast
by
a
storm
it
is
certain
that
we
must
sell
fish
neither
more
nor
less
like
true
fishermen
only
people
might
guess
who
we
are
and
might
molest
us
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
we
should
be
in
a
condition
to
defend
ourselves
and
this
is
why
i
have
selected
men
of
spirit
and
courage
we
shall
lead
a
steady
life
and
not
incur
much
danger
seeing
that
we
have
behind
us
a
powerful
protector
thanks
to
whom
no
embarrassment
is
possible
one
thing
alone
puzzles
me
but
i
hope
that
after
a
short
explanation
you
will
relieve
me
from
that
difficulty
the
thing
which
puzzles
me
is
taking
with
me
a
crew
of
stupid
fishermen
which
crew
will
annoy
me
immensely
whilst
if
by
chance
there
were
among
you
any
who
have
seen
the
sea
oh
don
t
let
that
trouble
you
said
one
of
the
recruits
i
was
a
prisoner
among
the
pirates
of
tunis
three
years
and
can
maneuver
a
boat
like
an
admiral
see
said
d
artagnan
what
an
admirable
thing
chance
is
d
artagnan
pronounced
these
words
with
an
indefinable
tone
of
feigned
bonhomie
for
he
knew
very
well
that
the
victim
of
the
pirates
was
an
old
corsair
and
had
engaged
him
in
consequence
of
that
knowledge
but
d
artagnan
never
said
more
than
there
was
need
to
say
in
order
to
leave
people
in
doubt
he
paid
himself
with
the
explanation
and
welcomed
the
effect
without
appearing
to
be
preoccupied
with
the
cause
and
i
said
a
second
i
by
chance
had
an
uncle
who
directed
the
works
of
the
port
of
la
rochelle
when
quite
a
child
i
played
about
the
boats
and
i
know
how
to
handle
an
oar
or
a
sail
as
well
as
the
best
ponantais
sailor
the
latter
did
not
lie
much
more
than
the
first
for
he
had
rowed
on
board
his
majesty
s
galleys
six
years
at
ciotat
two
others
were
more
frank
they
confessed
honestly
that
they
had
served
on
board
a
vessel
as
soldiers
as
punishment
and
did
not
blush
for
it
d
artagnan
found
himself
then
the
leader
of
ten
men
of
war
and
four
sailors
having
at
once
an
land
army
and
a
sea
force
which
would
have
carried
the
pride
of
planchet
to
its
height
if
planchet
had
known
the
details
nothing
was
now
left
but
arranging
the
general
orders
and
d
artagnan
gave
them
with
precision
he
enjoined
his
men
to
be
ready
to
set
out
for
the
hague
some
following
the
coast
which
leads
to
breskens
others
the
road
to
antwerp
the
rendezvous
was
given
by
calculating
each
day
s
march
a
fortnight
from
that
time
upon
the
chief
place
at
the
hague
d
artagnan
recommended
his
men
to
go
in
couples
as
they
liked
best
from
sympathy
he
himself
selected
from
among
those
with
the
least
disreputable
look
two
guards
whom
he
had
formerly
known
and
whose
only
faults
were
being
drunkards
and
gamblers
these
men
had
not
entirely
lost
all
ideas
of
civilization
and
under
proper
garments
their
hearts
would
beat
again
d
artagnan
not
to
create
any
jealousy
with
the
others
made
the
rest
go
forward
he
kept
his
two
selected
ones
clothed
them
from
his
own
wardrobe
and
set
out
with
them
it
was
to
these
two
whom
he
seemed
to
honor
with
an
absolute
confidence
that
d
artagnan
imparted
a
false
secret
destined
to
secure
the
success
of
the
expedition
he
confessed
to
them
that
the
object
was
not
to
learn
to
what
extent
french
merchants
were
injured
by
english
smuggling
but
to
learn
how
far
french
smuggling
could
annoy
english
trade
these
men
appeared
convinced
they
were
effectively
so
d
artagnan
was
quite
sure
that
at
the
first
debauch
when
thoroughly
drunk
one
of
the
two
would
divulge
the
secret
to
the
whole
band
his
game
appeared
infallible
a
fortnight
after
all
we
have
said
had
taken
place
at
calais
the
whole
troop
assembled
at
the
hague
then
d
artagnan
perceived
that
all
his
men
with
remarkable
intelligence
had
already
travestied
themselves
into
sailors
more
or
less
by
the
sea
d
artagnan
left
them
to
sleep
in
a
den
in
newkerke
street
whilst
he
lodged
comfortably
upon
the
grand
canal
he
learned
that
the
king
of
england
had
come
back
to
his
old
ally
william
ii
of
nassau
stadtholder
of
holland
he
learned
also
that
the
refusal
of
louis
xiv
had
a
little
cooled
the
protection
afforded
him
up
to
that
time
and
in
consequence
he
had
gone
to
reside
in
a
little
village
house
at
scheveningen
situated
in
the
downs
on
the
about
a
league
from
the
hague
there
it
was
said
the
unfortunate
banished
king
consoled
himself
in
his
exile
by
looking
with
the
melancholy
peculiar
to
the
princes
of
his
race
at
that
immense
north
sea
which
separated
him
from
his
england
as
it
had
formerly
separated
mary
stuart
from
france
there
behind
the
trees
of
the
beautiful
wood
of
scheveningen
on
the
fine
sand
upon
which
grows
the
golden
broom
of
the
down
charles
ii
vegetated
as
it
did
more
unfortunate
for
he
had
life
and
thought
and
he
hoped
and
despaired
by
turns
d
artagnan
went
once
as
far
as
scheveningen
in
order
to
be
certain
that
all
was
true
that
was
said
of
the
king
he
beheld
charles
pensive
and
alone
coming
out
of
a
little
door
opening
into
the
wood
and
walking
on
the
beach
in
the
setting
sun
without
even
attracting
the
attention
of
the
fishermen
who
on
their
return
in
the
evening
drew
like
the
ancient
mariners
of
the
archipelago
their
barks
up
upon
the
sand
of
the
shore
d
artagnan
recognized
the
king
he
saw
him
fix
his
melancholy
look
upon
the
immense
extent
of
the
waters
and
absorb
upon
his
pale
countenance
the
red
rays
of
the
sun
already
cut
by
the
black
line
of
the
horizon
then
charles
returned
to
his
isolated
abode
always
alone
slow
and
sad
amusing
himself
with
making
the
friable
and
moving
sand
creak
beneath
his
feet
that
very
evening
d
artagnan
hired
for
a
thousand
livres
a
worth
four
thousand
he
paid
a
thousand
livres
down
and
deposited
the
three
thousand
with
a
burgomaster
after
which
he
brought
on
board
without
their
being
seen
the
six
men
who
formed
his
land
army
and
with
the
rising
tide
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
got
into
the
open
sea
maneuvering
ostensibly
with
the
four
others
and
depending
upon
the
science
of
his
galley
slave
as
upon
that
of
the
first
pilot
of
the
port
chapter
xxiii
in
which
the
author
is
forced
to
write
a
little
history
while
kings
and
men
were
thus
occupied
with
england
which
governed
itself
quite
alone
and
which
it
must
be
said
in
its
praise
had
never
been
so
badly
governed
a
man
upon
whom
god
had
fixed
his
eye
and
placed
his
finger
a
man
predestined
to
write
his
name
in
brilliant
letters
upon
the
page
of
history
was
pursuing
in
the
face
of
the
world
a
work
full
of
mystery
and
audacity
he
went
on
and
no
one
knew
whither
he
meant
to
go
although
not
only
england
but
france
and
europe
watched
him
marching
with
a
firm
step
and
head
held
high
all
that
was
known
of
this
man
we
are
about
to
tell
monk
had
just
declared
himself
in
favor
of
the
liberty
of
the
rump
parliament
a
parliament
which
general
lambert
imitating
cromwell
whose
lieutenant
he
had
been
had
just
blocked
up
so
closely
in
order
to
bring
it
to
his
will
that
no
member
during
all
the
blockade
was
able
to
go
out
and
only
one
peter
wentworth
had
been
able
to
get
in
lambert
and
monk
everything
was
summed
up
in
these
two
men
the
first
representing
military
despotism
the
second
pure
republicanism
these
men
were
the
two
sole
political
representatives
of
that
revolution
in
which
charles
had
first
lost
his
crown
and
afterwards
his
head
as
regarded
lambert
he
did
not
dissemble
his
views
he
sought
to
establish
a
military
government
and
to
be
himself
the
head
of
that
government
monk
a
rigid
republican
some
said
wished
to
maintain
the
rump
parliament
that
visible
though
degenerated
representative
of
the
republic
monk
artful
and
ambitious
said
others
wished
simply
to
make
of
this
parliament
which
he
affected
to
protect
a
solid
step
by
which
to
mount
the
throne
which
cromwell
had
left
empty
but
upon
which
he
had
never
dared
to
take
his
seat
thus
lambert
by
persecuting
the
parliament
and
monk
by
declaring
for
it
had
mutually
proclaimed
themselves
enemies
of
each
other
monk
and
lambert
therefore
had
at
first
thought
of
creating
an
army
each
for
himself
monk
in
scotland
where
were
the
presbyterians
and
the
royalists
that
is
to
say
the
malcontents
lambert
in
london
where
was
found
as
is
always
the
case
the
strongest
opposition
to
the
existing
power
which
it
had
beneath
its
eyes
monk
had
pacified
scotland
he
had
there
formed
for
himself
an
army
and
found
an
asylum
the
one
watched
the
other
monk
knew
that
the
day
was
not
yet
come
the
day
marked
by
the
lord
for
a
great
change
his
sword
therefore
appeared
glued
to
the
sheath
inexpugnable
in
his
wild
and
mountainous
scotland
an
absolute
general
king
of
an
army
of
eleven
thousand
old
soldiers
whom
he
had
more
than
once
led
on
to
victory
as
well
informed
nay
even
better
of
the
affairs
of
london
than
lambert
who
held
garrison
in
the
city
such
was
the
position
of
monk
when
at
a
hundred
leagues
from
london
he
declared
himself
for
the
parliament
lambert
on
the
contrary
as
we
have
said
lived
in
the
capital
that
was
the
center
of
all
his
operations
and
he
there
collected
all
around
him
all
his
friends
and
all
the
people
of
the
lower
class
eternally
inclined
to
cherish
the
enemies
of
constituted
power
it
was
then
in
london
that
lambert
learnt
the
support
that
from
the
frontiers
of
scotland
monk
lent
to
the
parliament
he
judged
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
that
the
tweed
was
not
so
far
distant
from
the
thames
that
an
army
could
not
march
from
one
river
to
the
other
particularly
when
it
was
well
commanded
he
knew
besides
that
as
fast
as
the
soldiers
of
monk
penetrated
into
england
they
would
form
on
their
route
that
ball
of
snow
the
emblem
of
the
globe
of
fortune
which
is
for
the
ambitious
nothing
but
a
step
growing
unceasingly
higher
to
conduct
him
to
his
object
he
got
together
therefore
his
army
formidable
at
the
same
time
for
its
composition
and
its
numbers
and
hastened
to
meet
monk
who
on
his
part
like
a
prudent
navigator
sailing
amidst
rocks
advanced
by
very
short
marches
listening
to
the
reports
which
came
from
london
the
two
armies
came
in
sight
of
each
other
near
newcastle
lambert
arriving
first
encamped
in
the
city
itself
monk
always
circumspect
stopped
where
he
was
and
placed
his
general
quarters
at
coldstream
on
the
tweed
the
sight
of
lambert
spread
joy
through
monk
s
army
whilst
on
the
contrary
the
sight
of
monk
threw
disorder
into
lambert
s
army
it
might
have
been
thought
that
these
intrepid
warriors
who
had
made
such
a
noise
in
the
streets
of
london
had
set
out
with
the
hopes
of
meeting
no
one
and
that
now
seeing
that
they
had
met
an
army
and
that
that
army
hoisted
before
them
not
only
a
standard
but
still
further
a
cause
and
a
principle
it
might
have
been
believed
we
say
that
these
intrepid
warriors
had
begun
to
reflect
that
they
were
less
good
republicans
than
the
soldiers
of
monk
since
the
latter
supported
the
parliament
whilst
lambert
supported
nothing
not
even
himself
as
to
monk
if
he
had
had
to
reflect
or
if
he
did
reflect
it
must
have
been
after
a
sad
fashion
for
history
relates
and
that
modest
dame
it
is
well
known
never
lies
history
relates
that
the
day
of
his
arrival
at
coldstream
search
was
made
in
vain
throughout
the
place
for
a
single
sheep
if
monk
had
commanded
an
english
army
that
was
enough
to
have
brought
about
a
general
desertion
but
it
is
not
with
the
scots
as
it
is
with
the
english
to
whom
that
fluid
flesh
which
is
called
blood
is
a
paramount
necessity
the
scots
a
poor
and
sober
race
live
upon
a
little
barley
crushed
between
two
stones
diluted
with
the
water
of
the
fountain
and
cooked
upon
another
stone
heated
the
scots
their
distribution
of
barley
being
made
cared
very
little
whether
there
was
or
was
not
any
meat
in
coldstream
monk
little
accustomed
to
was
hungry
and
his
staff
at
least
as
hungry
as
himself
looked
with
anxiety
right
and
left
to
know
what
was
being
prepared
for
supper
monk
ordered
search
to
be
made
his
scouts
had
on
arriving
in
the
place
found
it
deserted
and
the
cupboards
empty
upon
butchers
and
bakers
it
was
of
no
use
depending
in
coldstream
the
smallest
morsel
of
bread
then
could
not
be
found
for
the
general
s
table
as
accounts
succeeded
each
other
all
equally
unsatisfactory
monk
seeing
terror
and
discouragement
upon
every
face
declared
that
he
was
not
hungry
besides
they
should
eat
on
the
morrow
since
lambert
was
there
probably
with
the
intention
of
giving
battle
and
consequently
would
give
up
his
provisions
if
he
were
forced
from
newcastle
or
forever
to
relieve
monk
s
soldiers
from
hunger
if
he
conquered
this
consolation
was
only
efficacious
upon
a
very
small
number
but
of
what
importance
was
it
to
monk
for
monk
was
very
absolute
under
the
appearance
of
the
most
perfect
mildness
every
one
therefore
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
or
at
least
to
appear
so
monk
quite
as
hungry
as
his
people
but
affecting
perfect
indifference
for
the
absent
mutton
cut
a
fragment
of
tobacco
half
an
inch
long
from
the
carotte
of
a
sergeant
who
formed
part
of
his
suite
and
began
to
masticate
the
said
fragment
assuring
his
lieutenant
that
hunger
was
a
chimera
and
that
besides
people
were
never
hungry
when
they
had
anything
to
chew
this
joke
satisfied
some
of
those
who
had
resisted
monk
s
first
deduction
drawn
from
the
neighborhood
of
lambert
s
army
the
number
of
the
dissentients
diminished
greatly
the
guard
took
their
posts
the
patrols
began
and
the
general
continued
his
frugal
repast
beneath
his
open
tent
between
his
camp
and
that
of
the
enemy
stood
an
old
abbey
of
which
at
the
present
day
there
only
remain
some
ruins
but
which
then
was
in
existence
and
was
called
newcastle
abbey
it
was
built
upon
a
vast
site
independent
at
once
of
the
plain
and
of
the
river
because
it
was
almost
a
marsh
fed
by
springs
and
kept
up
by
rains
nevertheless
in
the
midst
of
these
pools
of
water
covered
with
long
grass
rushes
and
reeds
were
seen
solid
spots
of
ground
formerly
used
as
the
the
park
the
and
other
dependencies
of
the
abbey
looking
like
one
of
those
great
whose
body
is
round
whilst
the
claws
go
diverging
round
from
this
circumference
the
one
of
the
longest
claws
of
the
abbey
extended
to
monk
s
camp
unfortunately
it
was
as
we
have
said
early
in
june
and
the
being
abandoned
offered
no
resources
monk
had
ordered
this
spot
to
be
guarded
as
most
subject
to
surprises
the
fires
of
the
enemy
s
general
were
plainly
to
be
perceived
on
the
other
side
of
the
abbey
but
between
these
fires
and
the
abbey
extended
the
tweed
unfolding
its
luminous
scales
beneath
the
thick
shade
of
tall
green
oaks
monk
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
this
position
newcastle
and
its
environs
having
already
more
than
once
been
his
headquarters
he
knew
that
by
this
day
his
enemy
might
without
doubt
throw
a
few
scouts
into
these
ruins
and
promote
a
skirmish
but
that
by
night
he
would
take
care
to
abstain
from
such
a
risk
he
felt
himself
therefore
in
security
thus
his
soldiers
saw
him
after
what
he
boastingly
called
his
supper
that
is
to
say
after
the
exercise
of
mastication
reported
by
us
at
the
commencement
of
this
chapter
like
napoleon
on
the
eve
of
austerlitz
seated
asleep
in
his
rush
chair
half
beneath
the
light
of
his
lamp
half
beneath
the
reflection
of
the
moon
commencing
its
ascent
in
the
heavens
which
denoted
that
it
was
nearly
half
past
nine
in
the
evening
all
at
once
monk
was
roused
from
his
half
sleep
fictitious
perhaps
by
a
troop
of
soldiers
who
came
with
joyous
cries
and
kicked
the
poles
of
his
tent
with
a
humming
noise
as
if
on
purpose
to
wake
him
there
was
no
need
of
so
much
noise
the
general
opened
his
eyes
quickly
well
my
children
what
is
going
on
now
asked
the
general
general
replied
several
voices
at
once
general
you
shall
have
some
supper
i
have
had
my
supper
gentlemen
replied
he
quietly
and
was
comfortably
digesting
it
as
you
see
but
come
in
and
tell
me
what
brings
you
hither
good
news
general
bah
has
lambert
sent
us
word
that
he
will
fight
no
but
we
have
just
captured
a
conveying
fish
to
newcastle
and
you
have
done
very
wrong
my
friends
these
gentlemen
from
london
are
delicate
must
have
their
first
course
you
will
put
them
sadly
out
of
humor
this
evening
and
they
will
be
pitiless
it
would
really
be
in
good
taste
to
send
back
to
lambert
both
his
fish
and
his
fishermen
unless
and
the
general
reflected
an
instant
tell
me
continued
he
what
are
these
fishermen
if
you
please
some
picard
seamen
who
were
fishing
on
the
coasts
of
france
or
holland
and
who
have
been
thrown
upon
ours
by
a
gale
of
wind
do
any
among
them
speak
our
language
the
leader
spoke
some
few
words
of
english
the
mistrust
of
the
general
was
awakened
in
proportion
as
fresh
information
reached
him
that
is
well
said
he
i
wish
to
see
these
men
bring
them
to
me
an
officer
immediately
went
to
fetch
them
how
many
are
there
of
them
continued
monk
and
what
is
their
vessel
there
are
ten
or
twelve
of
them
general
and
they
were
aboard
of
a
kind
of
as
it
is
called
apparently
and
you
say
they
were
carrying
fish
to
lambert
s
camp
yes
general
and
they
seem
to
have
had
good
luck
in
their
fishing
humph
we
shall
see
that
said
monk
at
this
moment
the
officer
returned
bringing
the
leader
of
the
fishermen
with
him
he
was
a
man
from
fifty
to
years
old
but
for
his
age
he
was
of
middle
height
and
wore
a
justaucorps
of
coarse
wool
a
cap
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
a
cutlass
hung
from
his
belt
and
he
walked
with
the
hesitation
peculiar
to
sailors
who
never
knowing
thanks
to
the
movement
of
the
vessel
whether
their
foot
will
be
placed
upon
the
plank
or
upon
nothing
give
to
every
one
of
their
steps
a
fall
as
firm
as
if
they
were
driving
a
pile
monk
with
an
acute
and
penetrating
look
examined
the
fisherman
for
some
time
while
the
latter
smiled
with
that
smile
half
cunning
half
silly
peculiar
to
french
peasants
do
you
speak
english
asked
monk
in
excellent
french
ah
but
badly
my
lord
replied
the
fisherman
this
reply
was
made
much
more
with
the
lively
and
sharp
accentuation
of
the
people
beyond
the
loire
than
with
the
accent
of
the
countries
of
the
west
and
north
of
france
but
you
do
speak
it
persisted
monk
in
order
to
examine
his
accent
once
more
eh
we
men
of
the
sea
replied
the
fisherman
speak
a
little
of
all
languages
then
you
are
a
sea
fisherman
i
am
at
present
my
lord
a
fisherman
and
a
famous
fisherman
too
i
have
taken
a
barbel
that
weighs
at
least
thirty
pounds
and
more
than
fifty
mullets
i
have
also
some
little
whitings
that
will
fry
beautifully
you
appear
to
me
to
have
fished
more
frequently
in
the
gulf
of
gascony
than
in
the
channel
said
monk
smiling
well
i
am
from
the
south
but
does
that
prevent
me
from
being
a
good
fisherman
my
lord
oh
not
at
all
i
shall
buy
your
fish
and
now
speak
frankly
for
whom
did
you
destine
them
my
lord
i
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
i
was
going
to
newcastle
following
the
coast
when
a
party
of
horsemen
who
were
passing
along
in
an
opposite
direction
made
a
sign
to
my
bark
to
turn
back
to
your
honor
s
camp
under
penalty
of
a
discharge
of
musketry
as
i
was
not
armed
for
fighting
added
the
fisherman
smiling
i
was
forced
to
submit
and
why
did
you
go
to
lambert
s
camp
in
preference
to
mine
my
lord
i
will
be
frank
will
your
lordship
permit
me
yes
and
even
if
need
be
shall
command
you
to
be
so
well
my
lord
i
was
going
to
lambert
s
camp
because
those
gentlemen
from
the
city
pay
well
whilst
your
scotchmen
puritans
presbyterians
covenanters
or
whatever
you
chose
to
call
them
eat
but
little
and
pay
for
nothing
monk
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
however
being
able
to
refrain
from
smiling
at
the
same
time
how
is
it
that
being
from
the
south
you
come
to
fish
on
our
coasts
because
i
have
been
fool
enough
to
marry
in
picardy
yes
but
even
picardy
is
not
england
my
lord
man
shoves
his
boat
into
the
sea
but
god
and
the
wind
do
the
rest
and
drive
the
boat
where
they
please
you
had
then
no
intention
of
landing
on
our
coasts
never
and
what
route
were
you
steering
we
were
returning
from
ostend
where
some
mackerel
had
already
been
seen
when
a
sharp
wind
from
the
south
drove
us
from
our
course
then
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
struggle
against
it
we
let
it
drive
us
it
then
became
necessary
not
to
lose
our
fish
which
were
good
to
go
and
sell
them
at
the
nearest
english
port
and
that
was
newcastle
we
were
told
the
opportunity
was
good
as
there
was
an
increase
of
population
in
the
camp
an
increase
of
population
in
the
city
both
we
were
told
were
full
of
gentlemen
very
rich
and
very
hungry
so
we
steered
our
course
towards
newcastle
and
your
companions
where
are
they
oh
my
companions
have
remained
on
board
they
are
sailors
without
the
least
instruction
whilst
you
said
monk
who
i
said
the
patron
laughing
i
have
sailed
about
with
my
father
and
i
know
what
is
called
a
sou
a
crown
a
pistole
a
louis
and
a
double
louis
in
all
the
languages
of
europe
my
crew
therefore
listen
to
me
as
they
would
to
an
oracle
and
obey
me
as
if
i
were
an
admiral
then
it
was
you
who
preferred
lambert
as
the
best
customer
yes
certainly
and
to
be
frank
my
lord
was
i
wrong
you
will
see
that
by
and
by
at
all
events
my
lord
if
there
is
a
fault
the
fault
is
mine
and
my
comrades
should
not
be
dealt
hardly
with
on
that
account
this
is
decidedly
an
intelligent
sharp
fellow
thought
monk
then
after
a
few
minutes
silence
employed
in
scrutinizing
the
fisherman
you
come
from
ostend
did
you
not
say
asked
the
general
yes
my
lord
in
a
straight
line
you
have
then
heard
of
the
affairs
of
the
day
for
i
have
no
doubt
that
both
in
france
and
holland
they
excite
interest
what
is
he
doing
who
calls
himself
king
of
england
oh
my
lord
cried
the
fisherman
with
loud
and
expansive
frankness
that
is
a
lucky
question
and
you
could
not
put
it
to
anybody
better
than
to
me
for
in
truth
i
can
make
you
a
famous
reply
imagine
my
lord
that
when
putting
into
ostend
to
sell
the
few
mackerel
we
had
caught
i
saw
the
walking
on
the
downs
waiting
for
his
horses
which
were
to
take
him
to
the
hague
he
is
a
rather
tall
pale
man
with
black
hair
and
somewhat
he
looks
ill
and
i
don
t
think
the
air
of
holland
agrees
with
him
monk
followed
with
the
greatest
attention
the
rapid
heightened
and
diffuse
conversation
of
the
fisherman
in
a
language
which
was
not
his
own
but
which
as
we
have
said
he
spoke
with
great
facility
the
fisherman
on
his
part
employed
sometimes
a
french
word
sometimes
an
english
word
and
sometimes
a
word
which
appeared
not
to
belong
to
any
language
but
was
in
truth
pure
gascon
fortunately
his
eyes
spoke
for
him
and
that
so
eloquently
that
it
was
possible
to
lose
a
word
from
his
mouth
but
not
a
single
intention
from
his
eyes
the
general
appeared
more
and
more
satisfied
with
his
examination
you
must
have
heard
that
this
as
you
call
him
was
going
to
the
hague
for
some
purpose
oh
yes
said
the
fisherman
i
heard
that
and
what
was
his
purpose
always
the
same
said
the
fisherman
must
he
not
always
entertain
the
fixed
idea
of
returning
to
england
that
is
true
said
monk
pensively
without
reckoning
added
the
fisherman
that
the
stadtholder
you
know
my
lord
william
ii
well
he
will
assist
him
with
all
his
power
ah
did
you
hear
that
said
no
but
i
think
so
you
are
quite
a
politician
apparently
said
monk
why
we
sailors
my
lord
who
are
accustomed
to
study
the
water
and
the
air
that
is
to
say
the
two
most
changeable
things
in
the
world
are
seldom
deceived
as
to
the
rest
now
then
said
monk
changing
the
conversation
i
am
told
you
are
going
to
provision
us
i
shall
do
my
best
my
lord
how
much
do
you
ask
for
your
fish
in
the
first
place
not
such
a
fool
as
to
name
a
price
my
lord
why
not
because
my
fish
is
yours
by
what
right
by
that
of
the
strongest
but
my
intention
is
to
pay
you
for
it
that
is
very
generous
of
you
my
lord
and
the
worth
of
it
my
lord
i
fix
no
price
what
do
you
ask
then
i
only
ask
to
be
permitted
to
go
away
where
to
general
lambert
s
camp
i
cried
the
fisherman
what
should
i
go
to
newcastle
for
now
i
have
no
longer
any
fish
at
all
events
listen
to
me
i
do
my
lord
i
shall
give
you
some
advice
how
my
lord
pay
me
and
give
me
good
advice
likewise
you
overwhelm
me
my
lord
monk
looked
more
earnestly
than
ever
at
the
fisherman
about
whom
he
still
appeared
to
entertain
some
suspicion
yes
i
shall
pay
you
and
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
for
the
two
things
are
connected
if
you
return
then
to
general
lambert
the
fisherman
made
a
movement
of
his
head
and
shoulders
which
signified
if
he
persists
in
it
i
won
t
contradict
him
do
not
cross
the
marsh
continued
monk
you
will
have
money
in
your
pocket
and
there
are
in
the
marsh
some
scottish
ambuscaders
i
have
placed
there
those
people
are
very
intractable
they
understand
but
very
little
of
the
language
which
you
speak
although
it
appears
to
me
to
be
composed
of
three
languages
they
might
take
from
you
what
i
have
given
you
and
on
your
return
to
your
country
you
would
not
fail
to
say
that
general
monk
has
two
hands
the
one
scottish
and
the
other
english
and
that
he
takes
back
with
the
scottish
hand
what
he
has
given
with
the
english
hand
oh
general
i
shall
go
where
you
like
be
sure
of
that
said
the
fisherman
with
a
fear
too
expressive
not
to
be
exaggerated
i
only
wish
to
remain
here
if
you
will
allow
me
to
remain
i
readily
believe
you
said
monk
with
an
imperceptible
smile
but
i
can
not
nevertheless
keep
you
in
my
tent
i
have
no
such
wish
my
lord
and
desire
only
that
your
lordship
should
point
out
where
you
will
have
me
posted
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
us
with
us
a
night
soon
passes
away
you
shall
be
conducted
to
your
bark
as
your
lordship
pleases
only
if
your
lordship
would
allow
me
to
be
taken
back
by
a
carpenter
i
should
be
extremely
grateful
why
so
because
the
gentlemen
of
your
army
in
dragging
my
boat
up
the
river
with
a
cable
pulled
by
their
horses
have
battered
it
a
little
upon
the
rocks
of
the
shore
so
that
i
have
at
least
two
feet
of
water
in
my
hold
my
lord
the
greater
reason
why
you
should
watch
your
boat
i
think
my
lord
i
am
quite
at
your
orders
said
the
fisherman
i
shall
empty
my
baskets
where
you
wish
then
you
will
pay
me
if
you
please
to
do
so
and
you
will
send
me
away
if
it
appears
right
to
you
you
see
i
am
very
easily
managed
and
pleased
my
lord
come
come
you
are
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
said
monk
whose
scrutinizing
glance
had
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
shade
in
the
clear
eye
of
the
fisherman
holloa
digby
an
appeared
you
will
conduct
this
good
fellow
and
his
companions
to
the
little
tents
of
the
canteens
in
front
of
the
marshes
so
that
they
will
be
near
their
bark
and
yet
will
not
sleep
on
board
what
is
the
matter
spithead
spithead
was
the
sergeant
from
whom
monk
had
borrowed
a
piece
of
tobacco
for
his
supper
spithead
having
entered
the
general
s
tent
without
being
sent
for
had
drawn
this
question
from
monk
my
lord
said
he
a
french
gentleman
has
just
presented
himself
at
the
outposts
and
wishes
to
speak
to
your
honor
all
this
was
said
be
it
understood
in
english
but
notwithstanding
it
produced
a
slight
emotion
in
the
fisherman
which
monk
occupied
with
his
sergeant
did
not
remark
who
is
the
gentleman
asked
monk
my
lord
replied
spithead
he
told
it
me
but
those
devils
of
french
names
are
so
difficult
to
pronounce
for
a
scottish
throat
that
i
could
not
retain
it
i
believe
however
from
what
the
guards
say
that
it
is
the
same
gentleman
who
presented
himself
yesterday
at
the
halt
and
whom
your
honor
would
not
receive
that
is
true
i
was
holding
a
council
of
officers
will
your
honor
give
any
orders
respecting
this
gentleman
yes
let
him
be
brought
here
must
we
take
any
precautions
such
as
what
blinding
his
eyes
for
instance
to
what
purpose
he
can
only
see
what
i
desire
should
be
seen
that
is
to
say
that
i
have
around
me
eleven
thousand
brave
men
who
ask
no
better
than
to
have
their
throats
cut
in
honor
of
the
parliament
of
scotland
and
england
and
this
man
my
lord
said
spithead
pointing
to
the
fisherman
who
during
this
conversation
had
remained
standing
and
motionless
like
a
man
who
sees
but
does
not
understand
ah
that
is
true
said
monk
then
turning
towards
the
fisherman
i
shall
see
you
again
my
brave
fellow
said
he
i
have
selected
a
lodging
for
you
digby
take
him
to
it
fear
nothing
your
money
shall
be
sent
to
you
presently
thank
you
my
lord
said
the
fisherman
and
after
having
bowed
he
left
the
tent
accompanied
by
digby
before
he
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
he
found
his
companions
who
were
whispering
with
a
volubility
which
did
not
appear
exempt
from
uneasiness
but
he
made
them
a
sign
which
seemed
to
reassure
them
hola
you
fellows
said
the
patron
come
this
way
his
lordship
general
monk
has
the
generosity
to
pay
us
for
our
fish
and
the
goodness
to
give
us
hospitality
for
the
fishermen
gathered
round
their
leader
and
conducted
by
digby
the
little
troop
proceeded
towards
the
canteens
the
post
as
may
be
remembered
which
had
been
assigned
them
as
they
went
along
in
the
dark
the
fishermen
passed
close
to
the
guards
who
were
conducting
the
french
gentleman
to
general
monk
this
gentleman
was
on
horseback
and
enveloped
in
a
large
cloak
which
prevented
the
patron
from
seeing
him
however
great
his
curiosity
might
be
as
to
the
gentleman
ignorant
that
he
was
elbowing
compatriots
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
little
troop
the
settled
his
guests
in
a
tolerably
comfortable
tent
from
which
was
dislodged
an
irish
canteen
woman
who
went
with
her
six
children
to
sleep
where
she
could
a
large
fire
was
burning
in
front
of
this
tent
and
threw
its
purple
light
over
the
grassy
pools
of
the
marsh
rippled
by
a
fresh
breeze
the
arrangements
made
the
wished
the
fishermen
calling
to
their
notice
that
they
might
see
from
the
door
of
the
tent
the
masts
of
their
bark
which
was
tossing
gently
on
the
tweed
a
proof
that
it
had
not
yet
sunk
the
sight
of
this
appeared
to
delight
the
leader
of
the
fishermen
infinitely
chapter
xxiv
the
treasure
the
french
gentleman
whom
spithead
had
announced
to
monk
and
who
closely
wrapped
in
his
cloak
had
passed
by
the
fishermen
who
left
the
general
s
tent
five
minutes
before
he
entered
it
the
french
gentleman
went
through
the
various
posts
without
even
casting
his
eyes
around
him
for
fear
of
appearing
indiscreet
as
the
order
had
been
given
he
was
conducted
to
the
tent
of
the
general
the
gentleman
was
left
alone
in
the
sort
of
in
front
of
the
principal
body
of
the
tent
where
he
awaited
monk
who
only
delayed
till
he
had
heard
the
report
of
his
people
and
observed
through
the
opening
of
the
canvas
the
countenance
of
the
person
who
solicited
an
audience
without
doubt
the
report
of
those
who
had
accompanied
the
french
gentleman
established
the
discretion
with
which
he
had
behaved
for
the
first
impression
the
stranger
received
of
the
welcome
made
him
by
the
general
was
more
favorable
than
he
could
have
expected
at
such
a
moment
and
on
the
part
of
so
suspicious
a
man
nevertheless
according
to
his
custom
when
monk
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
he
fixed
upon
him
his
penetrating
eyes
which
scrutiny
the
stranger
on
his
part
sustained
without
embarrassment
or
notice
at
the
end
of
a
few
seconds
the
general
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
and
head
in
sign
of
attention
my
lord
said
the
gentleman
in
excellent
english
i
have
requested
an
interview
with
your
honor
for
an
affair
of
importance
monsieur
replied
monk
in
french
you
speak
our
language
well
for
a
son
of
the
continent
i
ask
your
pardon
for
doubtless
the
question
is
indiscreet
do
you
speak
french
with
the
same
purity
there
is
nothing
surprising
my
lord
in
my
speaking
english
tolerably
i
resided
for
some
time
in
england
in
my
youth
and
since
then
i
have
made
two
voyages
to
this
country
these
words
were
spoken
in
french
and
with
a
purity
of
accent
that
bespoke
not
only
a
frenchman
but
a
frenchman
from
the
vicinity
of
tours
and
what
part
of
england
have
you
resided
in
monsieur
in
my
youth
london
my
lord
then
about
i
made
a
pleasure
trip
to
scotland
and
lastly
in
i
lived
for
some
time
at
newcastle
particularly
in
the
convent
the
gardens
of
which
are
now
occupied
by
your
army
excuse
me
monsieur
but
you
must
comprehend
that
these
questions
are
necessary
on
my
part
do
you
not
it
would
astonish
me
my
lord
if
they
were
not
asked
now
then
monsieur
what
can
i
do
to
serve
you
what
do
you
wish
this
my
lord
but
in
the
first
place
are
we
alone
perfectly
so
monsieur
except
of
course
the
post
which
guards
us
so
saying
monk
pulled
open
the
canvas
with
his
hand
and
pointed
to
the
soldier
placed
at
ten
paces
from
the
tent
and
who
at
the
first
call
could
have
rendered
assistance
in
a
second
in
that
case
my
lord
said
the
gentleman
in
as
calm
a
tone
as
if
he
had
been
for
a
length
of
time
in
habits
of
intimacy
with
his
interlocutor
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
address
myself
to
you
because
i
believe
you
to
be
an
honest
man
indeed
the
communication
i
am
about
to
make
to
you
will
prove
to
you
the
esteem
in
which
i
hold
you
monk
astonished
at
this
language
which
established
between
him
and
the
french
gentleman
equality
at
least
raised
his
piercing
eye
to
the
stranger
s
face
and
with
a
sensible
irony
conveyed
by
the
inflection
of
his
voice
alone
for
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moved
i
thank
you
monsieur
said
he
but
in
the
first
place
to
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
i
sent
you
my
name
by
your
sergeant
my
lord
excuse
him
monsieur
he
is
a
scotsman
he
could
not
retain
it
i
am
called
the
comte
de
la
fere
monsieur
said
athos
bowing
the
comte
de
la
fere
said
monk
endeavoring
to
recollect
the
name
pardon
me
monsieur
but
this
appears
to
be
the
first
time
i
have
ever
heard
that
name
do
you
fill
any
post
at
the
court
of
france
none
i
am
a
simple
gentleman
what
dignity
king
charles
made
me
a
knight
of
the
garter
and
queen
anne
of
austria
has
given
me
the
cordon
of
the
holy
ghost
these
are
my
only
dignities
the
garter
the
holy
ghost
are
you
a
knight
of
those
two
orders
monsieur
yes
and
on
what
occasions
have
such
favors
been
bestowed
upon
you
for
services
rendered
to
their
majesties
monk
looked
with
astonishment
at
this
man
who
appeared
to
him
so
simple
and
so
great
at
the
same
time
then
as
if
he
had
renounced
endeavoring
to
penetrate
this
mystery
of
a
simplicity
and
grandeur
upon
which
the
stranger
did
not
seem
disposed
to
give
him
any
other
information
than
that
which
he
had
already
received
did
you
present
yourself
yesterday
at
our
advanced
posts
and
was
sent
back
yes
my
lord
many
officers
monsieur
would
permit
no
one
to
enter
their
camp
particularly
on
the
eve
of
a
probable
battle
but
i
differ
from
my
colleagues
and
like
to
leave
nothing
behind
me
every
advice
is
good
to
me
all
danger
is
sent
to
me
by
god
and
i
weigh
it
in
my
hand
with
the
energy
he
has
given
me
so
yesterday
you
were
only
sent
back
on
account
of
the
council
i
was
holding
i
am
at
liberty
speak
my
lord
you
have
done
much
better
in
receiving
me
for
what
i
have
to
say
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
battle
you
are
about
to
fight
with
general
lambert
or
with
your
camp
and
the
proof
is
that
i
turned
away
my
head
that
i
might
not
see
your
men
and
closed
my
eyes
that
i
might
not
count
your
tents
no
i
came
to
speak
to
you
my
lord
on
my
own
account
speak
then
monsieur
said
monk
just
now
continued
athos
i
had
the
honor
of
telling
your
lordship
that
for
a
long
time
i
lived
in
newcastle
it
was
in
the
time
of
charles
and
when
the
king
was
given
up
to
cromwell
by
the
scots
i
know
said
monk
coldly
i
had
at
that
time
a
large
sum
in
gold
and
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
from
a
presentiment
perhaps
of
the
turn
which
things
would
take
on
the
morrow
i
concealed
it
in
the
principal
vault
of
the
covenant
of
newcastle
in
the
tower
whose
summit
you
now
see
silvered
by
the
moonbeams
my
treasure
has
then
remained
interred
there
and
i
have
come
to
entreat
your
honor
to
permit
me
to
withdraw
it
before
perhaps
the
battle
turning
that
way
a
mine
or
some
other
war
engine
has
destroyed
the
building
and
scattered
my
gold
or
rendered
it
so
apparent
that
the
soldiers
will
take
possession
of
it
monk
was
well
acquainted
with
mankind
he
saw
in
the
physiognomy
of
this
gentleman
all
the
energy
all
the
reason
all
the
circumspection
possible
he
could
therefore
only
attribute
to
a
magnanimous
confidence
the
revelation
the
frenchman
had
made
him
and
he
showed
himself
profoundly
touched
by
it
monsieur
said
he
you
have
augured
well
of
me
but
is
the
sum
worth
the
trouble
to
which
you
expose
yourself
do
you
even
believe
that
it
can
be
in
the
same
place
where
you
left
it
it
is
there
monsieur
i
do
not
doubt
that
is
a
reply
to
one
question
but
to
the
other
i
asked
you
if
the
sum
was
so
large
as
to
warrant
your
exposing
yourself
thus
it
is
really
large
yes
my
lord
for
it
is
a
million
i
inclosed
in
two
barrels
a
million
cried
monk
at
whom
this
time
in
turn
athos
looked
earnestly
and
long
monk
perceived
this
and
his
mistrust
returned
here
is
a
man
said
he
to
himself
who
is
laying
a
snare
for
me
so
you
wish
to
withdraw
this
money
monsieur
replied
he
as
i
understand
if
you
please
my
lord
this
very
evening
and
that
on
account
of
the
circumstances
i
have
named
but
monsieur
objected
monk
general
lambert
is
as
near
the
abbey
where
you
have
to
act
as
i
am
why
then
have
you
not
addressed
yourself
to
him
because
my
lord
when
one
acts
in
important
matters
it
is
best
to
consult
one
s
instinct
before
everything
well
general
lambert
does
not
inspire
with
me
so
much
confidence
as
you
do
be
it
so
monsieur
i
shall
assist
you
in
recovering
your
money
if
however
it
can
still
be
there
for
that
is
far
from
likely
since
twelve
years
have
rolled
away
and
many
events
have
taken
place
monk
dwelt
upon
this
point
to
see
if
the
french
gentleman
would
seize
the
evasions
that
were
open
to
him
but
athos
did
not
hesitate
i
assure
you
my
lord
he
said
firmly
that
my
conviction
is
that
the
two
barrels
have
neither
changed
place
nor
master
this
reply
had
removed
one
suspicion
from
the
mind
of
monk
but
it
had
suggested
another
without
doubt
this
frenchman
was
some
emissary
sent
to
entice
into
error
the
protector
of
the
parliament
the
gold
was
nothing
but
a
lure
and
by
the
help
of
this
lure
they
thought
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
general
this
gold
might
not
exist
it
was
monk
s
business
then
to
seize
the
frenchman
in
the
act
of
falsehood
and
trick
and
to
draw
from
the
false
step
itself
in
which
his
enemies
wished
to
entrap
him
a
triumph
for
his
renown
when
monk
was
determined
how
to
act
monsieur
said
he
to
athos
without
doubt
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
share
my
supper
this
evening
yes
my
lord
replied
athos
bowing
for
you
do
me
an
honor
of
which
i
feel
myself
worthy
by
the
inclination
which
drew
me
towards
you
it
is
so
much
the
more
gracious
on
your
part
to
accept
my
invitation
with
such
frankness
as
my
cooks
are
but
few
and
inexperienced
and
my
providers
have
returned
this
evening
so
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
fisherman
of
your
nation
who
strayed
into
our
camp
general
monk
would
have
gone
to
bed
without
his
supper
i
have
then
some
fresh
fish
to
offer
you
as
the
vendor
assures
me
my
lord
it
is
principally
for
the
sake
of
having
the
honor
to
pass
an
hour
with
you
after
this
exchange
of
civilities
during
which
monk
had
lost
nothing
of
his
circumspection
the
supper
or
what
was
to
serve
for
one
had
been
laid
upon
a
deal
table
monk
invited
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
be
seated
at
this
table
and
took
his
place
opposite
to
him
a
single
dish
of
boiled
fish
set
before
the
two
illustrious
guests
was
more
tempting
to
hungry
stomachs
than
to
delicate
palates
whilst
supping
that
is
while
eating
the
fish
washed
down
with
bad
ale
monk
got
athos
to
relate
to
him
the
last
events
of
the
fronde
the
reconciliation
of
de
conde
with
the
king
and
the
probable
marriage
of
the
infanta
of
spain
but
he
avoided
as
athos
himself
avoided
it
all
allusion
to
the
political
interests
which
united
or
rather
which
disunited
at
this
time
england
france
and
holland
monk
in
this
conversation
convinced
himself
of
one
thing
which
he
must
have
remarked
after
the
first
words
exchanged
that
was
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
of
high
distinction
he
could
not
be
an
assassin
and
it
was
repugnant
to
monk
to
believe
him
to
be
a
spy
but
there
was
sufficient
finesse
and
at
the
same
time
firmness
in
athos
to
lead
monk
to
fancy
he
was
a
conspirator
when
they
had
quitted
the
table
you
still
believe
in
your
treasure
then
monsieur
asked
monk
yes
my
lord
quite
seriously
seriously
and
you
think
you
can
find
the
place
again
where
it
was
buried
at
the
first
inspection
well
monsieur
from
curiosity
i
shall
accompany
you
and
it
is
so
much
the
more
necessary
that
i
should
accompany
you
that
you
would
find
great
difficulties
in
passing
through
the
camp
without
me
or
one
of
my
lieutenants
general
i
would
not
suffer
you
to
inconvenience
yourself
if
i
did
not
in
fact
stand
in
need
of
your
company
but
as
i
recognize
that
this
company
is
not
only
honorable
but
necessary
i
accept
it
do
you
desire
we
should
take
any
people
with
us
asked
monk
general
i
believe
that
would
be
useless
if
you
yourself
do
not
see
the
necessity
for
it
two
men
and
a
horse
will
suffice
to
transport
the
two
casks
on
board
the
felucca
which
brought
me
hither
but
it
will
be
necessary
to
pick
dig
and
remove
the
earth
and
split
stones
you
don
t
intend
doing
this
work
yourself
monsieur
do
you
general
there
is
no
picking
or
digging
required
the
treasure
is
buried
in
the
sepulchral
vault
of
the
convent
under
a
stone
in
which
is
fixed
a
large
iron
ring
and
under
which
there
are
four
steps
leading
down
the
two
casks
are
there
placed
end
to
end
covered
with
a
coat
of
plaster
in
the
form
of
a
bier
there
is
besides
an
inscription
which
will
enable
me
to
recognize
the
stone
and
as
i
am
not
willing
in
an
affair
of
delicacy
and
confidence
to
keep
the
secret
from
your
honor
here
is
the
inscription

venerabilis

castelli

mccviii
requiescat
in
monk
did
not
lose
a
single
word
he
was
astonished
either
at
the
marvelous
duplicity
of
this
man
and
the
superior
style
in
which
he
played
his
part
or
at
the
good
loyal
faith
with
which
he
presented
his
request
in
a
situation
in
which
concerning
a
million
of
money
risked
against
the
blow
from
a
dagger
amidst
an
army
that
would
have
looked
upon
the
theft
as
a
restitution
very
well
said
he
i
shall
accompany
you
and
the
adventure
appears
to
me
so
wonderful
that
i
shall
carry
the
torch
myself
and
saying
these
words
he
girded
on
a
short
sword
placed
a
pistol
in
his
belt
disclosing
in
this
movement
which
opened
his
doublet
a
little
the
fine
rings
of
a
coat
of
mail
destined
to
protect
him
from
the
first
of
an
assassin
after
which
he
took
a
scottish
dirk
in
his
left
hand
and
then
turning
to
athos
are
you
ready
monsieur
said
he
i
am
athos
as
if
in
opposition
to
what
monk
had
done
unfastened
his
poniard
which
he
placed
upon
the
table
unhooked
his
which
he
laid
close
to
his
poniard
and
without
affectation
opening
his
doublet
as
if
to
look
for
his
handkerchief
showed
beneath
his
fine
cambric
shirt
his
naked
breast
without
weapons
either
offensive
or
defensive
this
is
truly
a
singular
man
said
monk
he
is
without
any
arms
he
has
an
ambuscade
placed
somewhere
yonder
general
said
he
as
if
he
had
divined
monk
s
thought
you
wish
we
should
be
alone
that
is
very
right
but
a
great
captain
ought
never
to
expose
himself
with
temerity
it
is
night
the
passage
of
the
marsh
may
present
dangers
be
accompanied
you
are
right
replied
he
calling
digby
the
appeared
fifty
men
with
swords
and
muskets
said
he
looking
at
athos
that
is
too
few
if
there
is
danger
too
many
if
there
is
not
i
will
go
alone
said
monk
i
want
nobody
come
monsieur
chapter
xxv
the
marsh
athos
and
monk
passed
over
in
going
from
the
camp
towards
the
tweed
that
part
of
the
ground
which
digby
had
traversed
with
the
fishermen
coming
from
the
tweed
to
the
camp
the
aspect
of
this
place
the
aspect
of
the
changes
man
had
wrought
in
it
was
of
a
nature
to
produce
a
great
effect
upon
a
lively
and
delicate
imagination
like
that
of
athos
athos
looked
at
nothing
but
these
desolate
spots
monk
looked
at
nothing
but
athos
at
athos
who
with
his
eyes
sometimes
directed
towards
heaven
and
sometimes
towards
the
earth
sought
thought
and
sighed
digby
whom
the
last
orders
of
the
general
and
particularly
the
accent
with
which
he
had
given
them
had
at
first
a
little
excited
digby
followed
the
pair
at
about
twenty
paces
but
the
general
having
turned
round
as
if
astonished
to
find
his
orders
had
not
been
obeyed
the
perceived
his
indiscretion
and
returned
to
his
tent
he
supposed
that
the
general
wished
to
make
incognito
one
of
those
reviews
of
vigilance
which
every
experienced
captain
never
fails
to
make
on
the
eve
of
a
decisive
engagement
he
explained
to
himself
the
presence
of
athos
in
this
case
as
an
inferior
explains
all
that
is
mysterious
on
the
part
of
his
leader
athos
might
be
and
indeed
in
the
eyes
of
digby
must
be
a
spy
whose
information
was
to
enlighten
the
general
at
the
end
of
a
walk
of
about
ten
minutes
among
the
tents
and
posts
which
were
closer
together
near
the
headquarters
monk
entered
upon
a
little
causeway
which
diverged
into
three
branches
that
on
the
left
led
to
the
river
that
in
the
middle
to
newcastle
abbey
on
the
marsh
that
on
the
right
crossed
the
first
lines
of
monk
s
camp
that
is
to
say
the
lines
nearest
to
lambert
s
army
beyond
the
river
was
an
advanced
post
belonging
to
monk
s
army
which
watched
the
enemy
it
was
composed
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
scots
they
had
swum
across
the
tweed
and
in
case
of
attack
were
to
recross
it
in
the
same
manner
giving
the
alarm
but
as
there
was
no
post
at
that
spot
and
as
lambert
s
soldiers
were
not
so
prompt
at
taking
to
the
water
as
monk
s
were
the
latter
appeared
not
to
have
as
much
uneasiness
on
that
side
on
this
side
of
the
river
at
about
five
hundred
paces
from
the
old
abbey
the
fishermen
had
taken
up
their
abode
amidst
a
crowd
of
small
tents
raised
by
soldiers
of
the
neighboring
clans
who
had
with
them
their
wives
and
children
all
this
confusion
seen
by
the
moon
s
light
presented
a
striking
coup
d
oeil
the
half
shadow
enlarged
every
detail
and
the
light
that
flatterer
which
only
attaches
itself
to
the
polished
side
of
things
courted
upon
each
rusty
musket
the
point
still
left
intact
and
upon
every
rag
of
canvas
the
whitest
and
least
sullied
part
monk
arrived
then
with
athos
crossing
this
spot
illumined
with
a
double
light
the
silver
splendor
of
the
moon
and
the
red
blaze
of
the
fires
at
the
meeting
of
these
three
causeways
there
he
stopped
and
addressing
his
companion
monsieur
said
he
do
you
know
your
road
general
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
middle
causeway
leads
straight
to
the
abbey
that
is
right
but
we
shall
want
lights
to
guide
us
in
the
vaults
monk
turned
round
ah
i
thought
digby
was
following
us
said
he
so
much
the
better
he
will
procure
us
what
we
want
yes
general
there
is
a
man
yonder
who
has
been
walking
behind
us
for
some
time
digby
cried
monk
digby
come
here
if
you
please
but
instead
of
obeying
the
shadow
made
a
motion
of
surprise
and
retreating
instead
of
advancing
it
bent
down
and
disappeared
along
the
jetty
on
the
left
directing
its
course
towards
the
lodging
of
the
fishermen
it
appears
not
to
be
digby
said
monk
both
had
followed
the
shadow
which
had
vanished
but
it
was
not
so
rare
a
thing
for
a
man
to
be
wandering
about
at
eleven
o
clock
at
night
in
a
camp
in
which
are
reposing
ten
or
eleven
thousand
men
as
to
give
monk
and
athos
any
alarm
at
his
disappearance
as
it
is
so
said
monk
and
we
must
have
a
light
a
lantern
a
torch
or
something
by
which
we
may
see
where
to
see
our
feet
let
us
seek
this
light
general
the
first
soldier
we
meet
will
light
us
no
said
monk
in
order
to
discover
if
there
were
not
any
connivance
between
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
fisherman
no
i
should
prefer
one
of
these
french
sailors
who
came
this
evening
to
sell
me
their
fish
they
leave
and
the
secret
will
be
better
kept
by
them
whereas
if
a
report
should
be
spread
in
the
scottish
army
that
treasures
are
to
be
found
in
the
abbey
of
newcastle
my
highlanders
will
believe
there
is
a
million
concealed
beneath
every
slab
and
they
will
not
leave
stone
upon
stone
in
the
building
do
as
you
think
best
general
replied
athos
in
a
natural
tone
of
voice
making
evident
that
soldier
or
fisherman
was
the
same
to
him
and
that
he
had
no
preference
monk
approached
the
causeway
behind
which
had
disappeared
the
person
he
had
taken
for
digby
and
met
a
patrol
who
making
the
tour
of
the
tents
was
going
towards
headquarters
he
was
stopped
with
his
companion
gave
the
password
and
went
on
a
soldier
roused
by
the
noise
unrolled
his
plaid
and
looked
up
to
see
what
was
going
forward
ask
him
said
monk
to
athos
where
the
fishermen
are
if
i
were
to
speak
to
him
he
would
know
me
athos
went
up
to
the
soldier
who
pointed
out
the
tent
to
him
immediately
monk
and
athos
turned
towards
it
it
appeared
to
the
general
that
at
the
moment
they
came
up
a
shadow
like
that
they
had
already
seen
glided
into
this
tent
but
on
drawing
nearer
he
perceived
he
must
have
been
mistaken
for
all
of
them
were
asleep
pele
mele
and
nothing
was
seen
but
arms
and
legs
joined
crossed
and
mixed
athos
fearing
lest
he
should
be
suspected
of
connivance
with
some
of
his
compatriots
remained
outside
the
tent
hola
said
monk
in
french
wake
up
here
two
or
three
of
the
sleepers
got
up
i
want
a
man
to
light
me
continued
monk
your
honor
may
depend
on
us
said
a
voice
which
made
athos
start
where
do
you
wish
us
to
go
you
shall
see
a
light
come
quickly
yes
your
honor
does
it
please
your
honor
that
i
should
accompany
you
you
or
another
it
is
of
very
little
consequence
provided
i
have
a
light
it
is
strange
thought
athos
what
a
singular
voice
that
man
has
some
fire
you
fellows
cried
the
fisherman
come
make
haste
then
addressing
his
companion
nearest
to
him
in
a
low
voice
get
ready
a
light
menneville
said
he
and
hold
yourself
ready
for
anything
one
of
the
fishermen
struck
light
from
a
stone
set
fire
to
some
tinder
and
by
the
aid
of
a
match
lit
a
lantern
the
light
immediately
spread
all
over
the
tent
are
you
ready
monsieur
said
monk
to
athos
who
had
turned
away
not
to
expose
his
face
to
the
light
yes
general
replied
he
ah
the
french
gentleman
said
the
leader
of
the
fishermen
to
himself
peste
i
have
a
great
mind
to
charge
you
with
the
commission
menneville
he
may
know
me
light
light
this
dialogue
was
pronounced
at
the
back
of
the
tent
and
in
so
low
a
voice
that
monk
could
not
hear
a
syllable
of
it
he
was
besides
talking
with
athos
menneville
got
himself
ready
in
the
meantime
or
rather
received
the
orders
of
his
leader
well
said
monk
i
am
ready
general
said
the
fisherman
monk
athos
and
the
fisherman
left
the
tent
it
is
impossible
thought
athos
what
dream
could
put
that
into
my
head
go
forward
follow
the
middle
causeway
and
stretch
out
your
legs
said
monk
to
the
fisherman
they
were
not
twenty
paces
on
their
way
when
the
same
shadow
that
had
appeared
to
enter
the
tent
came
out
of
it
again
crawled
along
as
far
as
the
piles
and
protected
by
that
sort
of
parapet
placed
along
the
causeway
carefully
observed
the
march
of
the
general
all
three
disappeared
in
the
night
haze
they
were
walking
towards
newcastle
the
white
stones
of
which
appeared
to
them
like
sepulchers
after
standing
for
a
few
seconds
under
the
porch
they
penetrated
into
the
interior
the
door
had
been
broken
open
by
hatchets
a
post
of
four
men
slept
in
safety
in
a
corner
so
certain
were
they
that
the
attack
would
not
take
place
on
that
side
will
not
these
men
be
in
your
way
said
monk
to
athos
on
the
contrary
monsieur
they
will
assist
in
rolling
out
the
barrels
if
your
honor
will
permit
them
you
are
right
the
post
though
fast
asleep
roused
up
at
the
first
steps
of
the
three
visitors
amongst
the
briars
and
grass
that
invaded
the
porch
monk
gave
the
password
and
penetrated
into
the
interior
of
the
convent
preceded
by
the
light
he
walked
last
watching
the
least
movement
of
athos
his
naked
dirk
in
his
sleeve
and
ready
to
plunge
it
into
the
back
of
the
gentleman
at
the
first
suspicious
gesture
he
should
see
him
make
but
athos
with
a
firm
and
sure
step
crossed
the
chambers
and
courts
not
a
door
not
a
window
was
left
in
the
building
the
doors
had
been
burnt
some
on
the
spot
and
the
charcoal
of
them
was
still
jagged
with
the
action
of
the
fire
which
had
gone
out
of
itself
powerless
no
doubt
to
get
to
the
heart
of
those
massive
joints
of
oak
fastened
together
with
iron
nails
as
to
the
windows
all
the
panes
having
been
broken
night
birds
alarmed
by
the
torch
flew
away
through
their
holes
at
the
same
time
gigantic
bats
began
to
trace
their
vast
silent
circles
around
the
intruders
whilst
the
light
of
the
torch
made
their
shadows
tremble
on
the
high
stone
walls
monk
concluded
that
there
could
be
no
man
in
the
convent
since
wild
beasts
and
birds
were
there
still
and
fled
away
at
his
approach
after
having
passed
the
rubbish
and
torn
away
more
than
one
branch
of
ivy
that
had
made
itself
a
guardian
of
the
solitude
athos
arrived
at
the
vaults
situated
beneath
the
great
hall
but
the
entrance
of
which
was
from
the
chapel
there
he
stopped
here
we
are
general
said
he
this
then
is
the
slab
yes
ay
and
here
is
the
ring
but
the
ring
is
sealed
into
the
stone
we
must
have
a
lever
that
s
a
very
easy
thing
to
find
whilst
looking
around
them
athos
and
monk
perceived
a
little
ash
of
about
three
inches
in
diameter
which
had
shot
up
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
reaching
a
window
concealed
by
its
branches
have
you
a
knife
said
monk
to
the
fisherman
yes
monsieur
cut
down
this
tree
then
the
fisherman
obeyed
but
not
without
notching
his
cutlass
when
the
ash
was
cut
and
fashioned
into
the
shape
of
a
lever
the
three
men
penetrated
into
the
vault
stop
where
you
are
said
monk
to
the
fisherman
we
are
going
to
dig
up
some
powder
your
light
may
be
dangerous
the
man
drew
back
in
a
sort
of
terror
and
faithfully
kept
to
the
post
assigned
him
whilst
monk
and
athos
turned
behind
a
column
at
the
foot
of
which
penetrating
through
a
crack
was
a
moonbeam
reflected
exactly
on
the
stone
which
the
comte
de
la
fere
had
come
so
far
in
search
this
is
it
said
athos
pointing
out
to
the
general
the
latin
inscription
yes
said
monk
then
as
if
still
willing
to
leave
the
frenchman
one
means
of
evasion
do
you
not
observe
that
this
vault
has
already
been
broken
into
continued
he
and
that
several
statues
have
already
been
knocked
down
my
lord
you
have
without
doubt
heard
that
the
religious
respect
of
your
scots
loves
to
confide
to
the
statues
of
the
dead
the
valuable
objects
they
have
possessed
during
their
lives
therefore
the
soldiers
had
reason
to
think
that
under
the
pedestals
of
the
statues
which
ornament
most
of
these
tombs
a
treasure
was
hidden
they
have
consequently
broken
down
pedestal
and
statue
but
the
tomb
of
the
venerable
cannon
with
which
we
have
to
do
is
not
distinguished
by
any
monument
it
is
simple
therefore
it
has
been
protected
by
the
superstitious
fear
which
your
puritans
have
always
had
of
sacrilege
not
a
morsel
of
the
masonry
of
this
tomb
has
been
chipped
off
that
is
true
said
monk
athos
seized
the
lever
shall
i
help
you
said
monk
thank
you
my
lord
but
i
am
not
willing
that
your
honor
should
lend
your
hand
to
a
work
of
which
perhaps
you
would
not
take
the
responsibility
if
you
knew
the
probable
consequences
of
it
monk
raised
his
head
what
do
you
mean
by
that
monsieur
i
mean
but
that
man
stop
said
monk
i
perceive
what
you
are
afraid
of
i
shall
make
a
trial
monk
turned
towards
the
fisherman
the
whole
of
whose
profile
was
thrown
upon
the
wall
come
here
friend
said
he
in
english
and
in
a
tone
of
command
the
fisherman
did
not
stir
that
is
well
continued
he
he
does
not
know
english
speak
to
me
then
in
english
if
you
please
monsieur
my
lord
replied
athos
i
have
frequently
seen
men
in
certain
circumstances
have
sufficient
command
over
themselves
not
to
reply
to
a
question
put
to
them
in
a
language
they
understood
the
fisherman
is
perhaps
more
learned
than
we
believe
him
to
be
send
him
away
my
lord
i
beg
you
decidedly
said
monk
he
wishes
to
have
me
alone
in
this
vault
never
mind
we
shall
go
through
with
it
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
man
and
we
are
alone
my
friend
said
monk
to
the
fisherman
go
back
up
the
stairs
we
have
just
descended
and
watch
that
nobody
comes
to
disturb
us
the
fisherman
made
a
sign
of
obedience
leave
your
torch
said
monk
it
would
betray
your
presence
and
might
procure
you
a
the
fisherman
appeared
to
appreciate
the
counsel
he
laid
down
the
light
and
disappeared
under
the
vault
of
the
stairs
monk
took
up
the
torch
and
brought
it
to
the
foot
of
the
column
ah
ah
said
he
money
then
is
concealed
under
this
tomb
yes
my
lord
and
in
five
minutes
you
will
no
longer
doubt
it
at
the
same
time
athos
struck
a
violent
blow
upon
the
plaster
which
split
presenting
a
chink
for
the
point
of
the
lever
athos
introduced
the
bar
into
this
crack
and
soon
large
pieces
of
plaster
yielded
rising
up
like
rounded
slabs
then
the
comte
de
la
fere
seized
the
stones
and
threw
them
away
with
a
force
that
hands
so
delicate
as
his
might
not
have
been
supposed
capable
of
having
my
lord
said
athos
this
is
plainly
the
masonry
of
which
i
told
your
honor
yes
but
i
do
not
yet
see
the
casks
said
monk
if
i
had
a
dagger
said
athos
looking
round
him
you
should
soon
see
them
monsieur
unfortunately
i
left
mine
in
your
tent
i
would
willingly
offer
you
mine
said
monk
but
the
blade
is
too
thin
for
such
work
athos
appeared
to
look
around
him
for
a
thing
of
some
kind
that
might
serve
as
a
substitute
for
the
weapon
he
desired
monk
did
not
lose
one
of
the
movements
of
his
hands
or
one
of
the
expressions
of
his
eyes
why
do
you
not
ask
the
fisherman
for
his
cutlass
said
monk
he
has
a
cutlass
ah
that
is
true
said
athos
for
he
cut
the
tree
down
with
it
and
he
advanced
towards
the
stairs
friend
said
he
to
the
fisherman
throw
me
down
your
cutlass
if
you
please
i
want
it
the
noise
of
the
falling
weapon
sounded
on
the
steps
take
it
said
monk
it
is
a
solid
instrument
as
i
have
seen
and
a
strong
hand
might
make
good
use
of
it
athos
appeared
only
to
give
to
the
words
of
monk
the
natural
and
simple
sense
under
which
they
were
to
be
heard
and
understood
nor
did
he
remark
or
at
least
appear
to
remark
that
when
he
returned
with
the
weapon
monk
drew
back
placing
his
left
hand
on
the
stock
of
his
pistol
in
the
right
he
already
held
his
dirk
he
went
to
work
then
turning
his
back
to
monk
placing
his
life
in
his
hands
without
possible
defense
he
then
struck
during
several
seconds
so
skillfully
and
sharply
upon
the
intermediary
plaster
that
it
separated
into
two
parts
and
monk
was
able
to
discern
two
barrels
placed
end
to
end
and
which
their
weight
maintained
motionless
in
their
chalky
envelope
my
lord
said
athos
you
see
that
my
presentiments
have
not
been
disappointed
yes
monsieur
said
monk
and
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
you
are
satisfied
are
you
not
doubtless
i
am
the
loss
of
this
money
would
have
been
inexpressibly
great
to
me
but
i
was
certain
that
god
who
protects
the
good
cause
would
not
have
permitted
this
gold
which
should
procure
its
triumph
to
be
diverted
to
baser
purposes
you
are
upon
my
honor
as
mysterious
in
your
words
as
in
your
actions
monsieur
said
monk
just
now
as
i
did
not
perfectly
understand
you
when
you
said
that
you
were
not
willing
to
throw
upon
me
the
responsibility
of
the
work
we
were
accomplishing
i
had
reason
to
say
so
my
lord
and
now
you
speak
to
me
of
the
good
cause
what
do
you
mean
by
the
words
the
good
cause
we
are
defending
at
this
moment
in
england
five
or
six
causes
which
does
not
prevent
every
one
from
considering
his
own
not
only
as
the
good
cause
but
as
the
best
what
is
yours
monsieur
speak
boldly
that
we
may
see
if
upon
this
point
to
which
you
appear
to
attach
a
great
importance
we
are
of
the
same
opinion
athos
fixed
upon
monk
one
of
those
penetrating
looks
which
seemed
to
convey
to
him
to
whom
they
are
directed
a
challenge
to
conceal
a
single
one
of
his
thoughts
then
taking
off
his
hat
he
began
in
a
solemn
voice
while
his
interlocutor
with
one
hand
upon
his
visage
allowed
that
long
and
nervous
hand
to
compress
his
mustache
and
beard
while
his
vague
and
melancholy
eye
wandered
about
the
recesses
of
the
vaults
chapter

heart
and
mind
my
lord
said
the
comte
de
la
fere
you
are
an
noble
englishman
you
are
a
loyal
man
you
are
speaking
to
a
noble
frenchman
to
a
man
of
heart
the
gold
contained
in
these
two
casks
before
us
i
have
told
you
was
mine
i
was
wrong
it
is
the
first
lie
i
have
pronounced
in
my
life
a
temporary
lie
it
is
true
this
gold
is
the
property
of
king
charles
exiled
from
his
country
driven
from
his
palaces
the
orphan
at
once
of
his
father
and
his
throne
and
deprived
of
everything
even
of
the
melancholy
happiness
of
kissing
on
his
knees
the
stone
upon
which
the
hands
of
his
murderers
have
written
that
simple
epitaph
which
will
eternally
cry
out
for
vengeance
upon
them
here
lies
charles
monk
grew
slightly
pale
and
an
imperceptible
shudder
crept
over
his
skin
and
raised
his
gray
mustache
i
continued
athos
i
comte
de
la
fere
the
last
only
faithful
friend
the
poor
abandoned
prince
has
left
i
have
offered
him
to
come
hither
to
find
the
man
upon
whom
now
depends
the
fate
of
royalty
and
of
england
and
i
have
come
and
placed
myself
under
the
eye
of
this
man
and
have
placed
myself
naked
and
unarmed
in
his
hands
saying
my
lord
here
are
the
last
resources
of
a
prince
whom
god
made
your
master
whom
his
birth
made
your
king
upon
you
and
you
alone
depend
his
life
and
future
will
you
employ
this
money
in
consoling
england
for
the
evils
it
must
have
suffered
from
anarchy
that
is
to
say
will
you
aid
and
if
not
aid
will
you
allow
king
charles
ii
to
act
you
are
master
you
are
king
master
and
king
for
chance
sometimes
defeats
the
work
of
time
and
god
i
am
here
alone
with
you
my
lord
if
divided
success
alarms
you
if
my
complicity
annoys
you
you
are
armed
my
lord
and
here
is
a
grave
ready
dug
if
on
the
contrary
the
enthusiasm
of
your
cause
carries
you
away
if
you
are
what
you
appear
to
be
if
your
hand
in
what
it
undertakes
obeys
your
mind
and
your
mind
your
heart
here
are
the
means
of
ruining
forever
the
cause
of
your
enemy
charles
stuart
kill
then
the
man
you
have
before
you
for
that
man
will
never
return
to
him
who
has
sent
him
without
bearing
with
him
the
deposit
which
charles
his
father
confided
to
him
and
keep
the
gold
which
may
assist
in
carrying
on
the
civil
war
alas
my
lord
it
is
the
fate
of
this
unfortunate
prince
he
must
either
corrupt
or
kill
for
everything
resists
him
everything
repulses
him
everything
is
hostile
to
him
and
yet
he
is
marked
with
divine
seal
and
he
must
not
to
belie
his
blood
reascend
the
throne
or
die
upon
the
sacred
soil
of
his
my
lord
you
have
heard
me
to
any
other
but
the
illustrious
man
who
listens
to
me
i
would
have
said
my
lord
you
are
poor
my
lord
the
king
offers
you
this
million
as
an
earnest
of
an
immense
bargain
take
it
and
serve
charles
ii
as
i
served
charles
and
i
feel
assured
that
god
who
listens
to
us
who
sees
us
who
alone
reads
in
your
heart
shut
up
from
all
human
eyes
i
am
assured
god
will
give
you
a
happy
eternal
life
after
but
to
general
monk
to
the
illustrious
man
of
whose
standard
i
believe
i
have
taken
measure
i
say
my
lord
there
is
for
you
in
the
history
of
peoples
and
kings
a
brilliant
place
an
immortal
imperishable
glory
if
alone
without
any
other
interest
but
the
good
of
your
country
and
the
interests
of
justice
you
become
the
supporter
of
your
king
many
others
have
been
conquerors
and
glorious
usurpers
you
my
lord
you
will
be
content
with
being
the
most
virtuous
the
most
honest
and
the
most
incorruptible
of
men
you
will
have
held
a
crown
in
your
hand
and
instead
of
placing
it
upon
your
own
brow
you
will
have
deposited
it
upon
the
head
of
him
for
whom
it
was
made
oh
my
lord
act
thus
and
you
will
leave
to
posterity
the
most
enviable
of
names
in
which
no
human
creature
can
rival
athos
stopped
during
the
whole
time
that
the
noble
gentleman
was
speaking
monk
had
not
given
one
sign
of
either
approbation
or
disapprobation
scarcely
even
during
this
vehement
appeal
had
his
eyes
been
animated
with
that
fire
which
bespeaks
intelligence
the
comte
de
la
fere
looked
at
him
sorrowfully
and
on
seeing
that
melancholy
countenance
felt
discouragement
penetrate
to
his
very
heart
at
length
monk
appeared
to
recover
and
broke
the
silence
monsieur
said
he
in
a
mild
calm
tone
in
reply
to
you
i
will
make
use
of
your
own
words
to
any
other
but
yourself
i
would
reply
by
expulsion
imprisonment
or
still
worse
for
in
fact
you
tempt
me
and
you
force
me
at
the
same
time
but
you
are
one
of
those
men
monsieur
to
whom
it
is
impossible
to
refuse
the
attention
and
respect
they
merit
you
are
a
brave
gentleman
monsieur
i
say
so
and
i
am
a
judge
you
just
now
spoke
of
a
deposit
which
the
late
king
transmitted
through
you
to
his
son
are
you
then
one
of
those
frenchmen
who
as
i
have
heard
endeavored
to
carry
off
charles
from
whitehall
yes
my
lord
it
was
i
who
was
beneath
the
scaffold
during
the
execution
i
who
had
not
been
able
to
redeem
it
received
upon
my
brow
the
blood
of
the
martyred
king
i
received
at
the
same
time
the
last
word
of
charles
it
was
to
me
he
said
remember
and
in
saying
remember
he
alluded
to
the
money
at
your
feet
my
lord
i
have
heard
much
of
you
monsieur
said
monk
but
i
am
happy
to
have
in
the
first
place
appreciated
you
by
my
own
observations
and
not
by
my
remembrances
i
will
give
you
then
explanations
that
i
have
given
to
no
other
and
you
will
appreciate
what
a
distinction
i
make
between
you
and
the
persons
who
have
hitherto
been
sent
to
me
athos
bowed
and
prepared
to
absorb
greedily
the
words
which
fell
one
by
one
from
the
mouth
of
monk
those
words
rare
and
precious
as
the
dew
in
the
desert
you
spoke
to
me
said
monk
of
charles
ii
but
pray
monsieur
of
what
consequence
to
me
is
that
phantom
of
a
king
i
have
grown
old
in
a
war
and
in
a
policy
which
are
nowadays
so
closely
linked
together
that
every
man
of
the
sword
must
fight
in
virtue
of
his
rights
or
his
ambition
with
a
personal
interest
and
not
blindly
behind
an
officer
as
in
ordinary
wars
for
myself
i
perhaps
desire
nothing
but
i
fear
much
in
the
war
of
rests
the
liberty
of
england
and
perhaps
that
of
every
englishman
how
can
you
expect
that
i
free
in
the
position
i
have
made
for
myself
should
go
willingly
and
hold
out
my
hands
to
the
shackles
of
a
stranger
that
is
all
charles
is
to
me
he
has
fought
battles
here
which
he
has
lost
he
is
therefore
a
bad
captain
he
has
succeeded
in
no
negotiation
he
is
therefore
a
bad
diplomatist
he
has
paraded
his
wants
and
his
miseries
in
all
the
courts
of
europe
he
has
therefore
a
weak
and
pusillanimous
heart
nothing
noble
nothing
great
nothing
strong
has
hitherto
emanated
from
that
genius
which
aspires
to
govern
one
of
the
greatest
kingdoms
of
the
earth
i
know
this
charles
then
under
none
but
bad
aspects
and
you
would
wish
me
a
man
of
good
sense
to
go
and
make
myself
gratuitously
the
slave
of
a
creature
who
is
inferior
to
me
in
military
capacity
in
politics
and
in
dignity
no
monsieur
when
some
great
and
noble
action
shall
have
taught
me
to
value
charles
i
shall
perhaps
recognize
his
rights
to
a
throne
from
which
we
cast
the
father
because
he
wanted
the
virtues
which
his
son
has
hitherto
lacked
but
in
fact
of
rights
i
only
recognize
my
own
the
revolution
made
me
a
general
my
sword
will
make
me
protector
if
i
wish
it
let
charles
show
himself
let
him
present
himself
let
him
enter
the
competition
open
to
genius
and
above
all
let
him
remember
that
he
is
of
a
race
from
whom
more
will
be
expected
than
from
any
other
therefore
monsieur
say
no
more
about
him
i
neither
refuse
nor
accept
i
reserve
myself
i
wait
athos
knew
monk
to
be
too
well
informed
of
all
concerning
charles
to
venture
to
urge
the
discussion
further
it
was
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
my
lord
then
said
he
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
thank
you
and
why
monsieur
because
you
have
formed
a
correct
opinion
of
me
or
because
i
have
acted
according
to
your
judgment
is
that
in
truth
worthy
of
thanks
this
gold
which
you
are
about
to
carry
to
charles
will
serve
me
as
a
test
for
him
by
seeing
the
use
he
will
make
of
it
i
shall
have
an
opinion
which
now
i
have
not
and
yet
does
not
your
honor
fear
to
compromise
yourself
by
allowing
such
a
sum
to
be
carried
away
for
the
service
of
your
enemy
my
enemy
say
you
eh
monsieur
i
have
no
enemies
i
am
in
the
service
of
the
parliament
which
orders
me
to
fight
general
lambert
and
charles
stuart
its
enemies
and
not
mine
i
fight
them
if
the
parliament
on
the
contrary
ordered
me
to
unfurl
my
standards
on
the
port
of
london
and
to
assemble
my
soldiers
on
the
banks
to
receive
charles
you
would
obey
cried
athos
joyfully
pardon
me
said
monk
smiling
i
was
going
on
i
a
man
in
truth
how
could
i
forget
myself
was
going
to
speak
like
a
foolish
young
man
then
you
would
not
obey
said
athos
i
do
not
say
that
either
monsieur
the
welfare
of
my
country
before
everything
god
who
has
given
me
the
power
has
no
doubt
willed
that
i
should
have
that
power
for
the
good
of
all
and
he
has
given
me
at
the
same
time
discernment
if
the
parliament
were
to
order
such
a
thing
i
should
reflect
the
brow
of
athos
became
clouded
then
i
may
positively
say
that
your
honor
is
not
inclined
to
favor
king
charles
you
continue
to
question
me
monsieur
le
comte
allow
me
to
do
so
in
turn
if
you
please
do
monsieur
and
may
god
inspire
you
with
the
idea
of
replying
to
me
as
frankly
as
i
shall
reply
to
you
when
you
shall
have
taken
this
money
back
to
your
prince
what
advice
will
you
give
him
athos
fixed
upon
monk
a
proud
and
resolute
look
my
lord
said
he
with
this
million
which
others
would
perhaps
employ
in
negotiating
i
would
advise
the
king
to
rise
two
regiments
to
enter
scotland
which
you
have
just
pacified
to
give
to
the
people
the
franchises
which
the
revolution
promised
them
and
in
which
it
has
not
in
all
cases
kept
its
word
i
should
advise
him
to
command
in
person
this
little
army
which
would
believe
me
increase
and
to
die
standard
in
hand
and
sword
in
sheath
saying
englishmen
i
am
the
third
king
of
my
race
you
have
killed
beware
of
the
justice
of
god
monk
hung
down
his
head
and
mused
for
an
instant
if
he
succeeded
said
he
which
is
very
improbable
but
not
impossible
for
everything
is
possible
in
this
world
what
would
you
advise
him
to
do
to
think
that
by
the
will
of
god
he
lost
his
crown
by
the
good
will
of
men
he
recovered
it
an
ironical
smile
passed
over
the
lips
of
monk
unfortunately
monsieur
said
he
kings
do
not
know
how
to
follow
good
advice
ah
my
lord
charles
ii
is
not
a
king
replied
athos
smiling
in
his
turn
but
with
a
very
different
expression
from
monk
let
us
terminate
this
monsieur
le
comte
that
is
your
desire
is
it
not
athos
bowed
i
shall
give
orders
to
have
these
two
casks
transported
whither
you
please
where
are
you
lodging
monsieur
in
a
little
hamlet
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
your
honor
oh
i
know
the
hamlet
it
consists
of
five
or
six
houses
does
it
not
exactly
well
i
inhabit
the
first
two
occupy
it
with
me
it
is
their
bark
which
brought
me
ashore
but
your
own
vessel
monsieur
my
vessel
is
at
anchor
a
quarter
of
a
mile
at
sea
and
waits
for
me
you
do
not
think
however
of
setting
out
immediately
my
lord
i
shall
try
once
more
to
convince
your
honor
you
will
not
succeed
replied
monk
but
it
is
of
consequence
that
you
should
depart
from
newcastle
without
leaving
of
your
passage
the
least
suspicion
that
might
prove
injurious
to
me
or
you
my
officers
think
lambert
will
attack
me
i
on
the
contrary
am
convinced
he
will
not
stir
it
is
in
my
opinion
impossible
lambert
leads
an
army
devoid
of
homogeneous
principles
and
there
is
no
possible
army
with
such
elements
i
have
taught
my
soldiers
to
consider
my
authority
subordinate
to
another
therefore
after
me
round
me
and
beneath
me
they
still
look
for
something
it
would
result
that
if
i
were
dead
whatever
might
happen
my
army
would
not
be
demoralized
all
at
once
it
results
that
if
i
choose
to
absent
myself
for
instance
as
it
does
please
me
to
do
sometimes
there
would
not
be
in
the
camp
the
shadow
of
uneasiness
or
disorder
i
am
the
magnet
the
sympathetic
and
natural
strength
of
the
english
all
those
scattered
irons
that
will
be
sent
against
me
i
shall
attract
to
myself
lambert
at
this
moment
commands
eighteen
thousand
deserters
but
i
have
never
mentioned
that
to
my
officers
you
may
easily
suppose
nothing
is
more
useful
to
an
army
than
the
expectation
of
a
coming
battle
everybody
is
awake
everybody
is
on
guard
i
tell
you
this
that
you
may
live
in
perfect
security
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
then
to
cross
the
seas
within
a
week
there
will
be
something
fresh
either
a
battle
or
an
accommodation
then
as
you
have
judged
me
to
be
an
honorable
man
and
confided
your
secret
to
me
i
have
to
thank
you
for
this
confidence
and
i
shall
come
and
pay
you
a
visit
or
send
for
you
do
not
go
before
i
send
word
i
repeat
the
request
i
promise
you
general
cried
athos
with
a
joy
so
great
that
in
spite
of
all
his
circumspection
he
could
not
prevent
its
sparkling
in
his
eyes
monk
surprised
this
flash
and
immediately
extinguished
it
by
one
of
those
silent
smiles
which
always
caused
his
interlocutors
to
know
they
had
made
no
inroad
on
his
mind
then
my
lord
it
is
a
week
that
you
desire
me
to
wait
a
week
yes
monsieur
and
during
those
days
what
shall
i
do
if
there
should
be
a
battle
keep
at
a
distance
from
it
i
beseech
you
i
know
the
french
delight
in
such
amusements
you
might
take
a
fancy
to
see
how
we
fight
and
you
might
receive
some
chance
shot
our
scotsmen
are
very
bad
marksmen
and
i
do
not
wish
that
a
worthy
gentleman
like
you
should
return
to
france
wounded
nor
should
i
like
to
be
obliged
myself
to
send
to
your
prince
his
million
left
here
by
you
for
then
it
would
be
said
and
with
some
reason
that
i
paid
the
pretender
to
enable
him
to
make
war
against
the
parliament
go
then
monsieur
and
let
it
be
done
as
has
been
agreed
upon
ah
my
lord
said
athos
what
joy
it
would
give
me
to
be
the
first
that
penetrated
to
the
noble
heart
which
beats
beneath
that
cloak
you
think
then
that
i
have
secrets
said
monk
without
changing
the
half
cheerful
expression
of
his
countenance
why
monsieur
what
secret
can
you
expect
to
find
in
the
hollow
head
of
a
soldier
but
it
is
getting
late
and
our
torch
is
almost
out
let
us
call
our
man
hola
cried
monk
in
french
approaching
the
stairs
hola
fisherman
the
fisherman
benumbed
by
the
cold
night
air
replied
in
a
hoarse
voice
asking
what
they
wanted
of
him
go
to
the
post
said
monk
and
order
a
sergeant
in
the
name
of
general
monk
to
come
here
immediately
this
was
a
commission
easily
performed
for
the
sergeant
uneasy
at
the
general
s
being
in
that
desolate
abbey
had
drawn
nearer
by
degrees
and
was
not
much
further
off
than
the
fisherman
the
general
s
order
was
therefore
heard
by
him
and
he
hastened
to
obey
it
get
a
horse
and
two
men
said
monk
a
horse
and
two
men
repeated
the
sergeant
yes
replied
monk
have
you
got
any
means
of
getting
a
horse
with
a
or
two
panniers
no
doubt
at
a
hundred
paces
off
in
the
scottish
camp
very
well
what
shall
i
do
with
the
horse
general
look
here
the
sergeant
descended
the
three
steps
which
separated
him
from
monk
and
came
into
the
vault
you
see
said
monk
that
gentleman
yonder
yes
general
and
you
see
these
two
casks
perfectly
they
are
two
casks
one
containing
powder
and
the
other
balls
i
wish
these
casks
to
be
transported
to
the
little
hamlet
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
which
i
intend
to
occupy
with
two
hundred
muskets
you
understand
that
the
commission
is
a
secret
one
for
it
is
a
movement
that
may
decide
the
fate
of
the
battle
oh
general
murmured
the
sergeant
mind
then
let
these
casks
be
fastened
on
to
the
horse
and
let
them
be
escorted
by
two
men
and
you
to
the
residence
of
this
gentleman
who
is
my
friend
but
take
care
that
nobody
knows
it
i
would
go
by
the
marsh
if
i
knew
the
road
said
the
sergeant
i
know
one
myself
said
athos
it
is
not
wide
but
it
is
solid
having
been
made
upon
piles
and
with
care
we
shall
get
over
safely
enough
do
everything
this
gentleman
shall
order
you
to
do
oh
oh
the
casks
are
heavy
said
the
sergeant
trying
to
lift
one
they
weigh
four
hundred
pounds
each
if
they
contain
what
they
ought
to
contain
do
they
not
monsieur
thereabouts
said
athos
the
sergeant
went
in
search
of
the
two
men
and
the
horse
monk
left
alone
with
athos
affected
to
speak
to
him
on
nothing
but
indifferent
subjects
while
examining
the
vault
in
a
cursory
manner
then
hearing
the
horse
s
steps
i
leave
you
with
your
men
monsieur
said
he
and
return
to
the
camp
you
are
perfectly
safe
i
shall
see
you
again
then
my
lord
asked
athos
that
is
agreed
upon
monsieur
and
with
much
pleasure
monk
held
out
his
hand
to
athos
ah
my
lord
if
you
would
murmured
athos
hush
monsieur
it
is
agreed
that
we
shall
speak
no
more
of
that
and
bowing
to
athos
he
went
up
the
stairs
meeting
about
his
men
who
were
coming
down
he
had
not
gone
twenty
paces
when
a
faint
but
prolonged
whistle
was
heard
at
a
distance
monk
listened
but
seeing
nothing
and
hearing
nothing
he
continued
his
route
then
he
remembered
the
fisherman
and
looked
about
for
him
but
the
fisherman
had
disappeared
if
he
had
however
looked
with
more
attention
he
might
have
seen
that
man
bent
double
gliding
like
a
serpent
along
the
stones
and
losing
himself
in
the
mist
that
floated
over
the
surface
of
the
marsh
he
might
equally
have
seen
had
he
attempted
to
pierce
that
mist
a
spectacle
that
might
have
attracted
his
attention
and
that
was
the
rigging
of
the
vessel
which
had
changed
place
and
was
now
nearer
the
shore
but
monk
saw
nothing
and
thinking
he
had
nothing
to
fear
he
entered
the
deserted
causeway
which
led
to
his
camp
it
was
then
that
the
disappearance
of
the
fisherman
appeared
strange
and
that
a
real
suspicion
began
to
take
possession
of
his
mind
he
had
just
placed
at
the
orders
of
athos
the
only
post
that
could
protect
him
he
had
a
mile
of
causeway
to
traverse
before
he
could
regain
his
camp
the
fog
increased
with
such
intensity
that
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
objects
at
ten
paces
distance
monk
then
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
an
oar
over
the
marsh
on
the
right
who
goes
there
said
he
but
nobody
answered
then
he
cocked
his
pistol
took
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
quickened
his
pace
without
however
being
willing
to
call
anybody
such
a
summons
for
which
there
was
no
absolute
necessity
appeared
unworthy
of
him
chapter
xxvii
the
next
day
it
was
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
first
rays
of
day
lightened
the
pools
of
the
marsh
in
which
the
sun
was
reflected
like
a
red
ball
when
athos
awakening
and
opening
the
window
of
his
which
looked
out
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
perceived
at
fifteen
paces
distance
from
him
the
sergeant
and
the
men
who
had
accompanied
him
the
evening
before
and
who
after
having
deposited
the
casks
at
his
house
had
returned
to
the
camp
by
the
causeway
on
the
right
why
had
these
men
come
back
after
having
returned
to
the
camp
that
was
the
question
which
first
presented
itself
to
athos
the
sergeant
with
his
head
raised
appeared
to
be
watching
the
moment
when
the
gentleman
should
appear
to
address
him
athos
surprised
to
see
these
men
whom
he
had
seen
depart
the
night
before
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
his
astonishment
to
them
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
that
monsieur
said
the
sergeant
for
yesterday
the
general
commanded
me
to
watch
over
your
safety
and
i
thought
it
right
to
obey
that
order
is
the
general
at
the
camp
asked
athos
no
doubt
he
is
monsieur
as
when
he
left
you
he
was
going
back
well
wait
for
me
a
moment
i
am
going
thither
to
render
an
account
of
the
fidelity
with
which
you
fulfilled
your
duty
and
to
get
my
sword
which
i
left
upon
the
table
in
the
tent
this
happens
very
well
said
the
sergeant
for
we
were
about
to
request
you
to
do
so
athos
fancied
he
could
detect
an
air
of
equivocal
bonhomie
upon
the
countenance
of
the
sergeant
but
the
adventure
of
the
vault
might
have
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
man
and
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
allowed
some
of
the
feelings
which
agitated
his
mind
to
appear
in
his
face
athos
closed
the
doors
carefully
confiding
the
keys
to
grimaud
who
had
chosen
his
domicile
beneath
the
shed
itself
which
led
to
the
cellar
where
the
casks
had
been
deposited
the
sergeant
escorted
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
the
camp
there
a
fresh
guard
awaited
him
and
relieved
the
four
men
who
had
conducted
athos
this
fresh
guard
was
commanded
by
the
digby
who
on
their
way
fixed
upon
athos
looks
so
little
encouraging
that
the
frenchman
asked
himself
whence
arose
with
regard
to
him
this
vigilance
and
this
severity
when
the
evening
before
he
had
been
left
perfectly
free
he
nevertheless
continued
his
way
to
the
headquarters
keeping
to
himself
the
observations
which
men
and
things
forced
him
to
make
he
found
in
the
general
s
tent
to
which
he
had
been
introduced
the
evening
before
three
superior
officers
these
were
monk
s
lieutenant
and
two
colonels
athos
perceived
his
sword
it
was
still
on
the
table
where
he
left
it
neither
of
the
officers
had
seen
athos
consequently
neither
of
them
knew
him
monk
s
lieutenant
asked
at
the
appearance
of
athos
if
that
were
the
same
gentleman
with
whom
the
general
had
left
the
tent
yes
your
honor
said
the
sergeant
it
is
the
same
but
said
athos
haughtily
i
do
not
deny
it
i
think
and
now
gentlemen
in
turn
permit
me
to
ask
you
to
what
purpose
these
questions
are
asked
and
particularly
some
explanations
upon
the
tone
in
which
you
ask
them
monsieur
said
the
lieutenant
if
we
address
these
questions
to
you
it
is
because
we
have
a
right
to
do
so
and
if
we
make
them
in
a
particular
tone
it
is
because
that
tone
believe
me
agrees
with
the
circumstances
gentlemen
said
athos
you
do
not
know
who
i
am
but
i
must
tell
you
that
i
acknowledge
no
one
here
but
general
monk
as
my
equal
where
is
he
let
me
be
conducted
to
him
and
if
he
has
any
questions
to
put
to
me
i
will
answer
him
and
to
his
satisfaction
i
hope
i
repeat
gentlemen
where
is
the
general
eh
good
god
you
know
better
than
we
do
where
he
is
said
the
lieutenant
i
yes
you
monsieur
said
athos
i
do
not
understand
you
you
will
understand
me
and
in
the
first
place
do
not
speak
so
loudly
athos
smiled
disdainfully
we
don
t
ask
you
to
smile
said
one
of
the
colonels
warmly
we
require
you
to
answer
and
i
gentlemen
declare
to
you
that
i
will
not
reply
until
i
am
in
the
presence
of
the
general
but
replied
the
same
colonel
who
had
already
spoken
you
know
very
well
that
is
impossible
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
received
this
strange
reply
to
the
wish
i
express
said
athos
is
the
general
absent
this
question
was
made
with
such
apparent
good
faith
and
the
gentleman
wore
an
air
of
such
natural
surprise
that
the
three
officers
exchanged
a
meaning
look
the
lieutenant
by
a
tacit
convention
with
the
other
two
was
spokesman
monsieur
the
general
left
you
last
night
on
the
borders
of
the
monastery
yes
monsieur
and
you
went
it
is
not
for
me
to
answer
you
but
for
those
who
have
accompanied
me
they
were
your
soldiers
ask
them
but
if
we
please
to
question
you
then
it
will
please
me
to
reply
monsieur
that
i
do
not
recognize
any
one
here
that
i
know
no
one
here
but
the
general
and
that
it
is
to
him
alone
i
will
reply
so
be
it
monsieur
but
as
we
are
the
masters
we
constitute
ourselves
a
council
of
war
and
when
you
are
before
judges
you
must
reply
the
countenance
of
athos
expressed
nothing
but
astonishment
and
disdain
instead
of
the
terror
the
officers
expected
to
read
in
it
at
this
threat
scottish
or
english
judges
upon
me
a
subject
of
the
king
of
france
upon
me
placed
under
the
safeguard
of
british
honor
you
are
mad
gentlemen
said
athos
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
then
monsieur
said
one
of
them
do
you
pretend
not
to
know
where
the
general
is
to
that
monsieur
i
have
already
replied
yes
but
you
have
already
replied
an
incredible
thing
it
is
true
nevertheless
gentlemen
men
of
my
rank
are
not
generally
liars
i
am
a
gentleman
i
have
told
you
and
when
i
have
at
my
side
the
sword
which
by
an
excess
of
delicacy
i
left
last
night
upon
the
table
whereon
it
still
lies
believe
me
no
man
says
that
to
me
which
i
am
unwilling
to
hear
i
am
at
this
moment
disarmed
if
you
pretend
to
be
my
judges
try
me
if
you
are
but
my
executioners
kill
me
but
monsieur
asked
the
lieutenant
in
a
more
courteous
voice
struck
with
the
lofty
coolness
of
athos
sir
i
came
to
speak
confidentially
with
your
general
about
affairs
of
importance
it
was
not
an
ordinary
welcome
that
he
gave
me
the
accounts
your
soldiers
can
give
you
may
convince
you
of
that
if
then
the
general
received
me
in
that
manner
he
knew
my
titles
to
his
esteem
now
you
do
not
suspect
i
should
think
that
i
should
reveal
my
secrets
to
you
and
still
less
his
but
these
casks
what
do
they
contain
have
you
not
put
that
question
to
your
soldiers
what
was
their
reply
that
they
contained
powder
and
ball
from
whom
had
they
that
information
they
must
have
told
you
that
from
the
general
but
we
are
not
dupes
beware
gentlemen
it
is
not
to
me
you
are
now
giving
the
lie
it
is
to
your
leader
the
officers
again
looked
at
each
other
athos
continued
before
your
soldiers
the
general
told
me
to
wait
a
week
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
week
he
would
give
me
the
answer
he
had
to
make
me
have
i
fled
away
no
i
wait
he
told
you
to
wait
a
week
cried
the
lieutenant
he
told
me
that
so
clearly
sir
that
i
have
a
sloop
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
which
i
could
with
ease
have
joined
yesterday
and
embarked
now
if
i
have
remained
it
was
only
in
compliance
with
the
desire
of
your
general
his
honor
having
requested
me
not
to
depart
without
a
last
audience
which
he
fixed
at
a
week
hence
i
repeat
to
you
then
i
am
waiting
the
lieutenant
turned
towards
the
other
officers
and
said
in
a
low
voice
if
this
gentleman
speaks
truth
there
may
still
be
some
hope
the
general
may
be
carrying
out
some
negotiations
so
secret
that
he
thought
it
imprudent
to
inform
even
us
then
the
time
limited
for
his
absence
would
be
a
week
then
turning
towards
athos
monsieur
said
he
your
declaration
is
of
the
most
serious
importance
are
you
willing
to
repeat
it
under
the
seal
of
an
oath
sir
replied
athos
i
have
always
lived
in
a
world
where
my
simple
word
was
regarded
as
the
most
sacred
of
oaths
this
time
however
monsieur
the
circumstance
is
more
grave
than
any
you
may
have
been
placed
in
the
safety
of
the
whole
army
is
at
stake
reflect
the
general
has
disappeared
and
our
search
for
him
has
been
in
vain
is
this
disappearance
natural
has
a
crime
been
committed
are
we
not
bound
to
carry
our
investigations
to
extremity
have
we
any
right
to
wait
with
patience
at
this
moment
everything
monsieur
depends
upon
the
words
you
are
about
to
pronounce
thus
questioned
gentlemen
i
no
longer
hesitate
said
athos
yes
i
came
hither
to
converse
confidentially
with
general
monk
and
ask
him
for
an
answer
regarding
certain
interests
yes
the
general
being
doubtless
unable
to
pronounce
before
the
expected
battle
begged
me
to
remain
a
week
in
the
house
i
inhabit
promising
me
that
in
a
week
i
should
see
him
again
yes
all
this
is
true
and
i
swear
it
by
god
who
is
the
absolute
master
of
my
life
and
yours
athos
pronounced
these
words
with
so
much
grandeur
and
solemnity
that
the
three
officers
were
almost
convinced
nevertheless
one
of
the
colonels
made
a
last
attempt
monsieur
said
he
although
we
may
now
be
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
what
you
say
there
is
yet
a
strange
mystery
in
all
this
the
general
is
too
prudent
a
man
to
have
thus
abandoned
his
army
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
without
having
at
least
given
notice
of
it
to
one
of
us
as
for
myself
i
can
not
believe
but
some
strange
event
has
been
the
cause
of
this
disappearance
yesterday
some
foreign
fishermen
came
to
sell
their
fish
here
they
were
lodged
yonder
among
the
scots
that
is
to
say
on
the
road
the
general
took
with
this
gentleman
to
go
to
the
abbey
and
to
return
from
it
it
was
one
of
these
fishermen
that
accompanied
the
general
with
a
light
and
this
morning
bark
and
fishermen
have
all
disappeared
carried
away
by
the
night
s
tide
for
my
part
said
the
lieutenant
i
see
nothing
in
that
that
is
not
quite
natural
for
these
people
were
not
prisoners
no
but
i
repeat
it
was
one
of
them
who
lighted
the
general
and
this
gentleman
to
the
abbey
and
digby
assures
us
that
the
general
had
strong
suspicions
concerning
those
people
now
who
can
say
whether
these
people
were
not
connected
with
this
gentleman
and
that
the
blow
being
struck
the
gentleman
who
is
evidently
brave
did
not
remain
to
reassure
us
by
his
presence
and
to
prevent
our
researches
being
made
in
a
right
direction
this
speech
made
an
impression
upon
the
other
two
officers
sir
said
athos
permit
me
to
tell
you
that
your
reasoning
though
specious
in
appearance
nevertheless
wants
consistency
as
regards
me
i
have
remained
you
say
to
divert
suspicion
well
on
the
contrary
suspicions
arise
in
me
as
well
as
in
you
and
i
say
it
is
impossible
gentlemen
that
the
general
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
should
leave
his
army
without
saying
anything
to
at
least
one
of
his
officers
yes
there
is
some
strange
event
connected
with
this
instead
of
being
idle
and
waiting
you
must
display
all
the
activity
and
all
the
vigilance
possible
i
am
your
prisoner
gentlemen
upon
parole
or
otherwise
my
honor
is
concerned
in
ascertaining
what
has
become
of
general
monk
and
to
such
a
point
that
if
you
were
to
say
to
me
depart
i
should
reply
no
i
will
remain
and
if
you
were
to
ask
my
opinion
i
should
add
yes
the
general
is
the
victim
of
some
conspiracy
for
if
he
had
intended
to
leave
the
camp
he
would
have
told
me
seek
then
search
the
land
search
the
sea
the
general
has
not
gone
of
his
own
good
will
the
lieutenant
made
a
sign
to
the
two
other
officers
no
monsieur
said
he
no
in
your
turn
you
go
too
far
the
general
has
nothing
to
suffer
from
these
events
and
no
doubt
has
directed
them
what
monk
is
now
doing
he
has
often
done
before
we
are
wrong
in
alarming
ourselves
his
absence
will
doubtless
be
of
short
duration
therefore
let
us
beware
lest
by
a
pusillanimity
which
the
general
would
consider
a
crime
of
making
his
absence
public
and
by
that
means
demoralize
the
army
the
general
gives
a
striking
proof
of
his
confidence
in
us
let
us
show
ourselves
worthy
of
it
gentlemen
let
the
most
profound
silence
cover
all
this
with
an
impenetrable
veil
we
will
detain
this
gentleman
not
from
mistrust
of
him
with
regard
to
the
crime
but
to
assure
more
effectively
the
secret
of
the
general
s
absence
by
keeping
among
ourselves
therefore
until
fresh
orders
the
gentleman
will
remain
at
headquarters
gentlemen
said
athos
you
forget
that
last
night
the
general
confided
to
me
a
deposit
over
which
i
am
bound
to
watch
give
me
whatever
guard
you
like
chain
me
if
you
like
but
leave
me
the
house
i
inhabit
for
my
prison
the
general
on
his
return
would
reproach
you
i
swear
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
for
having
displeased
him
in
this
so
be
it
monsieur
said
the
lieutenant
return
to
your
abode
then
they
placed
over
athos
a
guard
of
fifty
men
who
surrounded
his
house
without
losing
sight
of
him
for
a
minute
the
secret
remained
secure
but
hours
days
passed
away
without
the
general
s
returning
or
without
anything
being
heard
of
him
chapter
xxviii
smuggling
two
days
after
the
events
we
have
just
related
and
while
general
monk
was
expected
every
minute
in
the
camp
to
which
he
did
not
return
a
little
dutch
felucca
manned
by
eleven
men
cast
anchor
upon
the
coast
of
scheveningen
nearly
within
of
the
port
it
was
night
the
darkness
was
great
the
tide
rose
in
the
darkness
it
was
a
capital
time
to
land
passengers
and
merchandise
the
road
of
scheveningen
forms
a
vast
crescent
it
is
not
very
deep
and
not
very
safe
therefore
nothing
is
seen
stationed
there
but
large
flemish
hoys
or
some
of
those
dutch
barks
which
fishermen
draw
up
on
the
sand
on
rollers
as
the
ancients
did
according
to
virgil
when
the
tide
is
rising
and
advancing
on
land
it
is
not
prudent
to
bring
the
vessels
too
close
in
shore
for
if
the
wind
is
fresh
the
prows
are
buried
in
the
sand
and
the
sand
of
that
coast
is
spongy
it
receives
easily
but
does
not
yield
so
well
it
was
on
this
account
no
doubt
that
a
boat
was
detached
from
the
bark
as
soon
as
the
latter
had
cast
anchor
and
came
with
eight
sailors
amidst
whom
was
to
be
seen
an
object
of
an
oblong
form
a
sort
of
large
pannier
or
bale
the
shore
was
deserted
the
few
fishermen
inhabiting
the
down
were
gone
to
bed
the
only
sentinel
that
guarded
the
coast
a
coast
very
badly
guarded
seeing
that
a
landing
from
large
ships
was
impossible
without
having
been
able
to
follow
the
example
of
the
fishermen
who
were
gone
to
bed
imitated
them
so
far
that
he
slept
at
the
back
of
his
as
soundly
as
they
slept
in
their
beds
the
only
noise
to
be
heard
then
was
the
whistling
of
the
night
breeze
among
the
bushes
and
the
brambles
of
the
downs
but
the
people
who
were
approaching
were
doubtless
mistrustful
people
for
this
real
silence
and
apparent
solitude
did
not
satisfy
them
their
boat
therefore
scarcely
as
visible
as
a
dark
speck
upon
the
ocean
gilded
along
noiselessly
avoiding
the
use
of
their
oars
for
fear
of
being
heard
and
gained
the
nearest
land
scarcely
had
it
touched
the
ground
when
a
single
man
jumped
out
of
the
boat
after
having
given
a
brief
order
in
a
manner
which
denoted
the
habit
of
commanding
in
consequence
of
this
order
several
muskets
immediately
glittered
in
the
feeble
light
reflected
from
that
mirror
of
the
heavens
the
sea
and
the
oblong
bale
of
which
we
spoke
containing
no
doubt
some
contraband
object
was
transported
to
land
with
infinite
precautions
immediately
after
that
the
man
who
had
landed
first
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
diagonally
towards
the
village
of
scheveningen
directing
his
course
to
the
nearest
point
of
the
wood
when
there
he
sought
for
that
house
already
described
as
the
temporary
residence
and
a
very
humble
residence
of
him
who
was
styled
by
courtesy
king
of
england
all
were
asleep
there
as
everywhere
else
only
a
large
dog
of
the
race
of
those
which
the
fishermen
of
scheveningen
harness
to
little
carts
to
carry
fish
to
the
hague
began
to
bark
formidably
as
soon
as
the
stranger
s
steps
were
audible
beneath
the
windows
but
the
watchfulness
instead
of
alarming
the
man
appeared
on
the
contrary
to
give
him
great
joy
for
his
voice
might
perhaps
have
proved
insufficient
to
rouse
the
people
of
the
house
whilst
with
an
auxiliary
of
that
sort
his
voice
became
almost
useless
the
stranger
waited
then
till
these
reiterated
and
sonorous
barkings
should
according
to
all
probability
have
produced
their
effect
and
then
he
ventured
a
summons
on
hearing
his
voice
the
dog
began
to
roar
with
such
violence
that
another
voice
was
soon
heard
from
the
interior
quieting
the
dog
with
that
the
dog
was
quieted
what
do
you
want
asked
that
voice
at
the
same
time
weak
broken
and
civil
i
want
his
majesty
king
charles
king
of
england
said
the
stranger
what
do
you
want
with
him
i
want
to
speak
with
him
who
are
you
ah
mordioux
you
ask
too
much
i
don
t
like
talking
through
doors
only
tell
me
your
name
i
don
t
like
to
declare
my
name
in
the
open
air
either
besides
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
not
eat
your
dog
and
i
hope
to
god
he
will
be
as
reserved

the
voice
uttered
an
exclamation
oh

said
a
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
monsieur
d
artagnan
what

at

words
he
let
in
d
artagnan
who
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
he
carried
in
his
hand
recognized
his
obstinate
interlocutor

come
on
my
own
part
come
parry
quick
the
king
i
want
the
king
parry
did
not
think
it
his
duty
to
resist
any
longer
he
knew
d
artagnan
of
old
he
knew
that
although
a
gascon
his
words
never
promised
more
than
they
could
stand
to
he
crossed
a
court
and
a
little
garden
appeased
the
dog
that
seemed
most
anxious
to
taste
of
the
musketeer
s
flesh
and
went
to
knock
at
the
window
of
a
chamber
forming
the
of
a
little
pavilion
immediately
a
little
dog
inhabiting
that
chamber
replied
to
the
great
dog
inhabiting
the
court
poor
king
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
these
are
his
it
is
true
he
is
not
the
worse
guarded
on
that
account
what
is
wanted
with
me
asked
the
king
from
the
back
of
the
chamber
sire
it
is
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
who
brings
you
some
news
a
noise
was
immediately
heard
in
the
chamber
a
door
was
opened
and
a
flood
of
light
inundated
the
corridor
and
the
garden
the
king
was
working
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
papers
were
lying
about
upon
his
desk
and
he
had
commenced
the
first
copy
of
a
letter
which
showed
by
the
numerous
erasures
the
trouble
he
had
had
in
writing
it
come
in
monsieur
le
chevalier
said
he
turning
around
then
perceiving
the
fisherman
what
do
you
mean
parry
where
is
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
asked
charles
he
is
before
you
sire
said
d
artagnan
what
in
that
costume
yes
look
at
me
sire
do
you
not
remember
having
seen
me
at
blois
in
the
of
king
louis
yes
monsieur
and
i
remember
i
was
much
pleased
with
you
d
artagnan
bowed
it
was
my
duty
to
behave
as
i
did
the
moment
i
knew
that
i
had
the
honor
of
being
near
your
majesty
you
bring
me
news
do
you
say
yes
sire
from
the
king
of
france
ma
foi
no
sire
replied
d
artagnan
your
majesty
must
have
seen
yonder
that
the
king
of
france
is
only
occupied
with
his
own
majesty
charles
raised
his
eyes
towards
heaven
no
sire
no
continued
d
artagnan
i
bring
news
entirely
composed
of
personal
facts
nevertheless
i
hope
that
your
majesty
will
listen
to
the
facts
and
news
with
some
favor
speak
monsieur
if
i
am
not
mistaken
sire
your
majesty
spoke
a
great
deal
at
blois
of
the
embarrassed
state
in
which
the
affairs
of
england
are
charles
colored
monsieur
said
he
it
was
to
the
king
of
france
i
related
oh
your
majesty
is
mistaken
said
the
musketeer
coolly
i
know
how
to
speak
to
kings
in
misfortune
it
is
only
when
they
are
in
misfortune
that
they
speak
to
me
once
fortunate
they
look
upon
me
no
more
i
have
then
for
your
majesty
not
only
the
greatest
respect
but
still
more
the
most
absolute
devotion
and
that
believe
me
with
me
sire
means
something
now
hearing
your
majesty
complain
of
fate
i
found
that
you
were
noble
and
generous
and
bore
misfortune
well
in
truth
said
charles
much
astonished
i
do
not
know
which
i
ought
to
prefer
your
freedoms
or
your
respects
you
will
choose
presently
sire
said
d
artagnan
then
your
majesty
complained
to
your
brother
louis
of
the
difficulty
you
experienced
in
returning
to
england
and
regaining
your
throne
for
want
of
men
and
money
charles
allowed
a
movement
of
impatience
to
escape
him
and
the
principal
object
your
majesty
found
in
your
way
continued
d
artagnan
was
a
certain
general
commanding
the
armies
of
the
parliament
and
who
was
playing
yonder
the
part
of
another
cromwell
did
not
your
majesty
say
so
yes
but
i
repeat
to
you
monsieur
those
words
were
for
the
king
s
ears
alone
and
you
will
see
sire
that
it
is
very
fortunate
that
they
fell
into
those
of
his
lieutenant
of
musketeers
that
man
so
troublesome
to
your
majesty
was
one
general
monk
i
believe
did
i
not
hear
his
name
correctly
sire
yes
monsieur
but
once
more
to
what
purpose
are
all
these
questions
oh
i
know
very
well
sire
that
etiquette
will
not
allow
kings
to
be
questioned
i
hope
however
presently
you
will
pardon
my
want
of
etiquette
your
majesty
added
that
notwithstanding
if
you
could
see
him
confer
with
him
and
meet
him
face
to
face
you
would
triumph
either
by
force
or
persuasion
over
that
obstacle
the
only
serious
one
the
only
insurmountable
one
the
only
real
one
you
met
with
on
your
road
all
that
is
true
monsieur
my
destiny
my
future
my
obscurity
or
my
glory
depend
upon
that
man
but
what
do
you
draw
from
that
one
thing
alone
that
if
this
general
monk
is
troublesome
to
the
point
your
majesty
describes
it
would
be
expedient
to
get
rid
of
him
or
make
an
ally
of
him
monsieur
a
king
who
has
neither
army
nor
money
as
you
have
heard
my
conversation
with
my
brother
louis
has
no
means
of
acting
against
a
man
like
monk
yes
sire
that
was
your
opinion
i
know
very
well
but
fortunately
for
you
it
was
not
mine
what
do
you
mean
by
that
that
without
an
army
and
without
a
million
i
have
done
i
myself
what
your
majesty
thought
could
alone
be
done
with
an
army
and
a
million
how
what
do
you
say
what
have
you
done
what
have
i
done
eh
well
sire
i
went
yonder
to
take
this
man
who
is
so
troublesome
to
your
majesty
in
england
exactly
sire
you
went
to
take
monk
in
england
should
i
by
chance
have
done
wrong
sire
in
truth
you
are
mad
monsieur
not
the
least
in
the
world
sire
you
have
taken
monk
yes
sire
where
in
the
midst
of
his
camp
the
king
trembled
with
impatience
and
having
taken
him
on
the
causeway
of
newcastle
i
bring
him
to
your
majesty
said
d
artagnan
simply
you
bring
him
to
me
cried
the
king
almost
indignant
at
what
he
considered
a
mystification
yes
sire
replied
d
artagnan
in
the
same
tone
i
bring
him
to
you
he
is
down
below
yonder
in
a
large
chest
pierced
with
holes
so
as
to
allow
him
to
breathe
good
god
oh
don
t
be
uneasy
sire
we
have
taken
the
greatest
possible
care
of
him
he
comes
in
good
state
and
in
perfect
condition
would
your
majesty
please
to
see
him
to
talk
with
him
or
to
have
him
thrown
into
the
sea
oh
heavens
repeated
charles
oh
heavens
do
you
speak
the
truth
monsieur
are
you
not
insulting
me
with
some
unworthy
joke
you
have
accomplished
this
act
of
audacity
and
genius
impossible
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
open
the
window
said
d
artagnan
opening
it
the
king
had
not
time
to
reply
yes
or
no
d
artagnan
gave
a
shrill
and
prolonged
whistle
which
he
repeated
three
times
through
the
silence
of
the
night
there
said
he
he
will
be
brought
to
your
majesty
chapter
xxix
fear
he
has
placed
his
money
and
that
of
planchet
in
the
sinking
fund
the
king
could
not
overcome
his
surprise
and
looked
sometimes
at
the
smiling
face
of
the
musketeer
and
sometimes
at
the
dark
window
which
opened
into
the
night
but
before
he
had
fixed
his
ideas
eight
of
d
artagnan
s
men
for
two
had
remained
to
take
care
of
the
bark
brought
to
the
house
where
parry
received
him
that
object
of
an
oblong
form
which
for
the
moment
inclosed
the
destinies
of
england
before
he
left
calais
d
artagnan
had
had
made
in
that
city
a
sort
of
coffin
large
and
deep
enough
for
a
man
to
turn
in
it
at
his
ease
the
bottom
and
sides
properly
upholstered
formed
a
bed
sufficiently
soft
to
prevent
the
rolling
of
the
ship
turning
this
kind
of
cage
into
a
the
little
grating
of
which
d
artagnan
had
spoken
to
the
king
like
the
visor
of
the
helmet
was
placed
opposite
to
the
man
s
face
it
was
so
constructed
that
at
the
least
cry
a
sudden
pressure
would
stifle
that
cry
and
if
necessary
him
who
had
uttered
that
cry
d
artagnan
was
so
well
acquainted
with
his
crew
and
his
prisoner
that
during
the
whole
voyage
he
had
been
in
dread
of
two
things
either
that
the
general
would
prefer
death
to
this
sort
of
imprisonment
and
would
smother
himself
by
endeavoring
to
speak
or
that
his
guards
would
allow
themselves
to
be
tempted
by
the
offers
of
the
prisoner
and
put
him
d
artagnan
into
the
box
instead
of
monk
d
artagnan
therefore
had
passed
the
two
days
and
the
two
nights
of
the
voyage
close
to
the
coffin
alone
with
the
general
offering
him
wine
and
food
which
the
latter
had
refused
and
constantly
endeavoring
to
reassure
him
upon
the
destiny
which
awaited
him
at
the
end
of
this
singular
captivity
two
pistols
on
the
table
and
his
naked
sword
made
d
artagnan
easy
with
regard
to
indiscretions
from
without
when
once
at
scheveningen
he
had
felt
completely
reassured
his
men
greatly
dreaded
any
conflict
with
the
lords
of
the
soil
he
had
besides
interested
in
his
cause
him
who
had
morally
served
him
as
lieutenant
and
whom
we
have
seen
reply
to
the
name
of
menneville
the
latter
not
being
a
vulgar
spirit
had
more
to
risk
than
the
others
because
he
had
more
conscience
he
believed
in
a
future
in
the
service
of
d
artagnan
and
consequently
would
have
allowed
himself
to
be
cut
to
pieces
rather
than
violate
the
order
given
by
his
leader
thus
it
was
that
once
landed
it
was
to
him
that
d
artagnan
had
confided
the
care
of
the
chest
and
the
general
s
breathing
it
was
he
too
he
had
ordered
to
have
the
chest
brought
by
the
seven
men
as
soon
as
he
should
hear
the
triple
whistle
we
have
seen
that
the
lieutenant
obeyed
the
coffer
once
in
the
house
d
artagnan
dismissed
his
men
with
a
gracious
smile
saying
messieurs
you
have
rendered
a
great
service
to
king
charles
who
in
less
than
six
weeks
will
be
king
of
england
your
gratification
will
then
be
doubled
return
to
the
boat
and
wait
for
me
upon
which
they
departed
with
such
shouts
of
joy
as
terrified
even
the
dog
himself
d
artagnan
had
caused
the
coffer
to
be
brought
as
far
as
the
king
s
he
then
with
great
care
closed
the
door
of
this
after
which
he
opened
the
coffer
and
said
to
the
general
general
i
have
a
thousand
excuses
to
make
to
you
my
manner
of
acting
has
not
been
worthy
of
such
a
man
as
you
i
know
very
well
but
i
wished
you
to
take
me
for
the
captain
of
a
bark
and
then
england
is
a
very
inconvenient
country
for
transports
i
hope
therefore
you
will
take
all
that
into
consideration
but
now
general
you
are
at
liberty
to
get
up
and
walk
this
said
he
cut
the
bonds
which
fastened
the
arms
and
hands
of
the
general
the
latter
got
up
and
then
sat
down
with
the
countenance
of
a
man
who
expects
death
d
artagnan
opened
the
door
of
charles
s
study
and
said
sire
here
is
your
enemy
monk
i
promised
myself
to
perform
this
service
for
your
majesty
it
is
done
now
order
as
you
please
monk
added
he
turning
towards
the
prisoner
you
are
in
the
presence
of
his
majesty
charles
sovereign
lord
of
great
britain
monk
raised
towards
the
prince
his
coldly
stoical
look
and
replied
i
know
no
king
of
great
britain
i
recognize
even
here
no
one
worthy
of
bearing
the
name
of
gentleman
for
it
is
in
the
name
of
king
charles
ii
that
an
emissary
whom
i
took
for
an
honest
man
came
and
laid
an
infamous
snare
for
me
i
have
fallen
into
that
snare
so
much
the
worse
for
me
now
you
the
tempter
said
he
to
the
king
you
the
executor
said
he
to
d
artagnan
remember
what
i
am
about
to
say
to
you
you
have
my
body
you
may
kill
it
and
i
advise
you
to
do
so
for
you
shall
never
have
my
mind
or
my
will
and
now
ask
me
not
a
single
word
as
from
this
moment
i
will
not
open
my
mouth
even
to
cry
out
i
have
said
and
he
pronounced
these
words
with
the
savage
invincible
resolution
of
the
most
mortified
puritan
d
artagnan
looked
at
his
prisoner
like
a
man
who
knows
the
value
of
every
word
and
who
fixes
that
value
according
to
the
accent
with
which
it
has
been
pronounced
the
fact
is
said
he
in
a
whisper
to
the
king
the
general
is
an
obstinate
man
he
would
not
take
a
mouthful
of
bread
nor
swallow
a
drop
of
wine
during
the
two
days
of
our
voyage
but
as
from
this
moment
it
is
your
majesty
who
must
decide
his
fate
i
wash
my
hands
of
him
monk
erect
pale
and
resigned
waited
with
his
eyes
fixed
and
his
arms
folded
d
artagnan
turned
towards
him
you
will
please
to
understand
perfectly
said
he
that
your
speech
otherwise
very
fine
does
not
suit
anybody
not
even
yourself
his
majesty
wished
to
speak
to
you
you
refused
an
interview
why
now
that
you
are
face
to
face
that
you
are
here
by
a
force
independent
of
your
will
why
do
you
confine
yourself
to
the
rigors
which
i
consider
useless
and
absurd
speak
what
the
devil
speak
if
only
to
say
monk
did
not
unclose
his
lips
monk
did
not
turn
his
eyes
monk
stroked
his
mustache
with
a
thoughtful
air
which
announced
that
matters
were
going
on
badly
during
all
this
time
charles
ii
had
fallen
into
a
profound
reverie
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
monk
with
the
man
he
had
so
much
desired
to
see
and
with
that
peculiar
glance
which
god
has
given
to
eagles
and
kings
he
had
fathomed
the
abyss
of
his
heart
he
beheld
monk
then
resolved
positively
to
die
rather
than
speak
which
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
so
considerable
a
man
the
wound
in
whose
mind
must
at
the
moment
have
been
cruel
charles
ii
formed
on
the
instant
one
of
those
resolutions
upon
which
an
ordinary
man
risks
his
life
a
general
his
fortune
and
a
king
his
kingdom
monsieur
said
he
to
monk
you
are
perfectly
right
upon
certain
points
i
do
not
therefore
ask
you
to
answer
me
but
to
listen
to
me
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
during
which
the
king
looked
at
monk
who
remained
impassible
you
have
made
me
just
now
a
painful
reproach
monsieur
continued
the
king
you
said
that
one
of
my
emissaries
had
been
to
newcastle
to
lay
a
snare
for
you
and
that
parenthetically
can
not
be
understood
by
d
artagnan
here
and
to
whom
before
everything
i
owe
sincere
thanks
for
his
generous
his
heroic
devotion
d
artagnan
bowed
with
respect
monk
took
no
notice
for
d
artagnan
and
observe
monk
i
do
not
say
this
to
excuse
myself
for
d
artagnan
continued
the
king
went
to
england
of
his
free
will
without
interest
without
orders
without
hope
like
a
true
gentleman
as
he
is
to
render
a
service
to
an
unfortunate
king
and
to
add
to
the
illustrious
actions
of
an
existence
already
so
well
filled
one
glorious
deed
more
d
artagnan
colored
a
little
and
coughed
to
keep
his
countenance
monk
did
not
stir
you
do
not
believe
what
i
tell
you
monk
continued
the
king
i
can
understand
that
such
proofs
of
devotion
are
so
rare
that
their
reality
may
well
be
put
in
doubt
monsieur
would
do
wrong
not
to
believe
you
sire
cried
d
artagnan
for
that
which
your
majesty
has
said
is
the
exact
truth
and
the
truth
so
exact
that
it
seems
in
going
to
fetch
the
general
i
have
done
something
which
sets
everything
wrong
in
truth
if
it
be
so
i
am
in
despair
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
king
pressing
the
hand
of
the
musketeer
you
have
obliged
me
as
much
as
if
you
had
promoted
the
success
of
my
cause
for
you
have
revealed
to
me
an
unknown
friend
to
whom
i
shall
ever
be
grateful
and
whom
i
shall
always
love
and
the
king
pressed
his
hand
cordially
and
continued
he
bowing
to
monk
an
enemy
whom
i
shall
henceforth
esteem
at
his
proper
value
the
eyes
of
the
puritan
flashed
but
only
once
and
his
countenance
for
an
instant
illuminated
by
that
flash
resumed
its
somber
impassibility
then
monsieur
d
artagnan
continued
charles
this
is
what
was
about
to
happen
le
comte
de
la
fere
who
you
know
i
believe
has
set
out
for
newcastle
what
athos
exclaimed
d
artagnan
yes
that
was
his
nom
de
guerre
i
believe
the
comte
de
la
fere
had
then
set
out
for
newcastle
and
was
going
perhaps
to
bring
the
general
to
hold
a
conference
with
me
or
with
those
of
my
party
when
you
violently
as
it
appears
interfered
with
the
negotiation
mordioux
replied
d
artagnan
he
entered
the
camp
the
very
evening
in
which
i
succeeded
in
getting
into
it
with
my
fishermen
an
almost
imperceptible
frown
on
the
brow
of
monk
told
d
artagnan
that
he
had
surmised
rightly
yes
yes
muttered
he
i
thought
i
knew
his
person
i
even
fancied
i
knew
his
voice
unlucky
wretch
that
i
am
oh
sire
pardon
me
i
thought
i
had
so
successfully
steered
my
bark
there
is
nothing
ill
in
it
sir
said
the
king
except
that
the
general
accuses
me
of
having
laid
a
snare
for
him
which
is
not
the
case
no
general
those
are
not
the
arms
which
i
contemplated
employing
with
you
as
you
will
soon
see
in
the
meanwhile
when
i
give
you
my
word
upon
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
believe
me
sir
believe
me
now
monsieur
d
artagnan
a
word
with
you
if
you
please
i
listen
on
my
knees
sire
you
are
truly
at
my
service
are
you
not
your
majesty
has
seen
that
i
am
too
much
so
that
is
well
from
a
man
like
you
one
word
suffices
in
addition
to
that
word
you
bring
actions
general
have
the
goodness
to
follow
me
come
with
us
m
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
considerably
surprised
prepared
to
obey
charles
ii
went
out
monk
followed
him
d
artagnan
followed
monk
charles
took
the
path
by
which
d
artagnan
had
come
to
his
abode
the
fresh
sea
breezes
soon
caressed
the
faces
of
the
three
nocturnal
travelers
and
at
fifty
paces
from
the
little
gate
which
charles
opened
they
found
themselves
upon
the
down
in
the
face
of
the
ocean
which
having
ceased
to
rise
reposed
upon
the
shore
like
a
wearied
monster
charles
ii
walked
pensively
along
his
head
hanging
down
and
his
hand
beneath
his
cloak
monk
followed
him
with
crossed
arms
and
an
uneasy
look
d
artagnan
came
last
with
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
where
is
the
boat
in
which
you
came
gentlemen
said
charles
to
the
musketeer
yonder
sire
i
have
seven
men
and
an
officer
waiting
me
in
that
little
bark
which
is
lighted
by
a
fire
yes
i
see
the
boat
is
drawn
upon
the
sand
but
you
certainly
did
not
come
from
newcastle
in
that
frail
bark
no
sire
i
freighted
a
felucca
at
my
own
expense
which
is
at
anchor
within
of
the
downs
it
was
in
that
felucca
we
made
the
voyage
sir
said
the
king
to
monk
you
are
free
however
firm
his
will
monk
could
not
suppress
an
exclamation
the
king
added
an
affirmative
motion
of
his
head
and
continued
we
shall
waken
a
fisherman
of
the
village
who
will
put
his
boat
to
sea
immediately
and
will
take
you
back
to
any
place
you
may
command
him
d
artagnan
here
will
escort
your
honor
i
place
d
artagnan
under
the
safeguard
of
your
loyalty
m
monk
monk
allowed
a
murmur
of
surprise
to
escape
him
and
d
artagnan
a
profound
sigh
the
king
without
appearing
to
notice
either
knocked
against
the
deal
trellis
which
inclosed
the
cabin
of
the
principal
fisherman
inhabiting
the
down
hey
keyser
cried
he
awake
who
calls
me
asked
the
fisherman
i
charles
the
king
ah
my
lord
cried
keyser
rising
ready
dressed
from
the
sail
in
which
he
slept
as
people
sleep
in
a
hammock
what
can
i
do
to
serve
you
captain
keyser
said
charles
you
must
set
sail
immediately
here
is
a
traveler
who
wishes
to
freight
your
bark
and
will
pay
you
well
serve
him
well
and
the
king
drew
back
a
few
steps
to
allow
monk
to
speak
to
the
fisherman
i
wish
to
cross
over
into
england
said
monk
who
spoke
dutch
enough
to
make
himself
understood
this
minute
said
the
patron
this
very
minute
if
you
wish
it
but
will
that
be
long
said
monk
not
half
an
hour
your
honor
my
eldest
son
is
at
this
moment
preparing
the
boat
as
we
were
going
out
fishing
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
well
is
all
arranged
asked
the
king
drawing
near
all
but
the
price
said
the
fisherman
yes
sire
that
is
my
affair
said
charles
the
gentleman
is
my
friend
monk
started
and
looked
at
charles
on
hearing
this
word
very
well
my
lord
replied
keyser
and
at
that
moment
they
heard
keyser
s
son
signaling
form
the
shore
with
the
blast
of
a
bull
s
horn
now
gentlemen
said
the
king
depart
sire
said
d
artagnan
will
it
please
your
majesty
to
grant
me
a
few
minutes
i
have
engaged
men
and
i
am
going
without
them
i
must
give
them
notice
whistle
to
them
said
charles
smiling
d
artagnan
accordingly
whistled
whilst
the
patron
keyser
replied
to
his
son
and
four
men
led
by
menneville
attended
the
first
summons
here
is
some
money
in
account
said
d
artagnan
putting
into
their
hands
a
purse
containing
two
thousand
five
hundred
livres
in
gold
go
and
wait
for
me
at
calais
you
know
where
and
d
artagnan
heaved
a
profound
sigh
as
he
let
the
purse
fall
into
the
hands
of
menneville
what
are
you
leaving
us
cried
the
men
for
a
short
time
said
d
artagnan
or
for
a
long
time
who
knows
but
with
livres
and
the
you
have
already
received
you
are
paid
according
to
our
agreement
we
are
quits
then
my
friend
but
the
boat
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
our
things
are
on
board
the
felucca
go
and
seek
them
and
then
set
off
immediately
yes
captain
d
artagnan
returned
to
monk
saying
monsieur
i
await
your
orders
for
i
understand
we
are
to
go
together
unless
my
company
be
disagreeable
to
you
on
the
contrary
monsieur
said
monk
come
gentlemen
on
board
cried
keyser
s
son
charles
bowed
to
the
general
with
grace
and
dignity
saying
you
will
pardon
me
this
unfortunate
accident
and
the
violence
to
which
you
have
been
subjected
when
you
are
convinced
that
i
was
not
the
cause
of
them
monk
bowed
profoundly
without
replying
on
his
side
charles
affected
not
to
say
a
word
to
d
artagnan
in
private
but
aloud
once
more
thanks
monsieur
le
chevalier
said
he
thanks
for
your
services
they
will
be
repaid
you
by
the
lord
god
who
i
hope
reserves
trials
and
troubles
for
me
alone
monk
followed
keyser
and
his
son
embarked
with
them
d
artagnan
came
after
muttering
to
himself
poor
planchet
poor
planchet
i
am
very
much
afraid
we
have
made
a
bad
speculation
chapter
xxx
the
shares
of
planchet
and
company
rise
again
to
par
during
the
passage
monk
only
spoke
to
d
artagnan
in
cases
of
urgent
necessity
thus
when
the
frenchman
hesitated
to
come
and
take
his
meals
poor
meals
composed
of
salt
fish
biscuit
and
hollands
gin
monk
called
him
saying
to
table
monsieur
to
table
this
was
all
d
artagnan
from
being
himself
on
all
great
occasions
extremely
concise
did
not
draw
from
the
general
s
conciseness
a
favorable
augury
of
the
result
of
his
mission
now
as
d
artagnan
had
plenty
of
time
for
reflection
he
battered
his
brains
during
this
time
in
endeavoring
to
find
out
how
athos
had
seen
king
charles
how
he
had
conspired
his
departure
with
him
and
lastly
how
he
had
entered
monk
s
camp
and
the
poor
lieutenant
of
musketeers
plucked
a
hair
from
his
mustache
every
time
that
he
reflected
that
the
horseman
who
accompanied
monk
on
the
night
of
the
famous
abduction
must
have
been
athos
at
length
after
a
passage
of
two
nights
and
two
days
the
patron
keyser
touched
at
the
point
where
monk
who
had
given
all
the
orders
during
the
voyage
had
commanded
they
should
land
it
was
exactly
at
the
mouth
of
the
little
river
near
where
athos
had
chosen
his
abode
daylight
was
waning
a
splendid
sun
like
a
red
steel
buckler
was
plunging
the
lower
extremity
of
its
disc
beneath
the
blue
line
of
the
sea
the
felucca
was
making
fair
way
up
the
river
tolerably
wide
in
that
part
but
monk
in
his
impatience
desired
to
be
landed
and
keyser
s
boat
set
him
and
d
artagnan
upon
the
muddy
bank
amidst
the
reeds
d
artagnan
resigned
to
obedience
followed
monk
exactly
as
a
chained
bear
follows
his
master
but
the
position
humiliated
him
not
a
little
and
he
grumbled
to
himself
that
the
service
of
kings
was
a
bitter
one
and
that
the
best
of
them
was
good
for
nothing
monk
walked
with
long
and
hasty
strides
it
might
be
thought
that
he
did
not
yet
feel
certain
of
having
reached
english
land
they
had
already
begun
to
perceive
distinctly
a
few
of
the
cottages
of
the
sailors
and
fishermen
spread
over
the
little
quay
of
this
humble
port
when
all
at
once
d
artagnan
cried
out
god
pardon
me
there
is
a
house
on
fire
monk
raised
his
eyes
and
perceived
there
was
in
fact
a
house
which
the
flames
were
beginning
to
devour
it
had
begun
at
a
little
shed
belonging
to
the
house
the
roof
of
which
had
caught
the
fresh
evening
breeze
agitated
the
fire
the
two
travelers
quickened
their
steps
hearing
loud
cries
and
seeing
as
they
drew
nearer
soldiers
with
their
glittering
arms
pointed
towards
the
house
on
fire
it
was
doubtless
this
menacing
occupation
which
had
made
them
neglect
to
signal
the
felucca
monk
stopped
short
for
an
instant
and
for
the
first
time
formulated
his
thoughts
into
words
eh
but
said
he
perhaps
they
are
not
my
soldiers
but
lambert
s
these
words
contained
at
once
a
sorrow
and
apprehension
and
a
reproach
perfectly
intelligible
to
d
artagnan
in
fact
during
the
general
s
absence
lambert
might
have
given
battle
conquered
and
dispersed
the
parliament
s
army
and
taken
with
his
own
the
place
of
monk
s
army
deprived
of
its
strongest
support
at
this
doubt
which
passed
from
the
mind
of
monk
to
his
own
d
artagnan
reasoned
in
this
manner
one
of
two
things
is
going
to
happen
either
monk
has
spoken
correctly
and
there
are
no
longer
any
but
lambertists
in
the
country
that
is
to
say
enemies
who
would
receive
me
wonderfully
well
since
it
is
to
me
they
owe
their
victory
or
nothing
is
changed
and
monk
transported
with
joy
at
finding
his
camp
still
in
the
same
place
will
not
prove
too
severe
in
his
settlement
with
me
whilst
thinking
thus
the
two
travelers
advanced
and
began
to
mingle
with
a
little
knot
of
sailors
who
looked
on
with
sorrow
at
the
burning
house
but
did
not
dare
to
say
anything
on
account
of
the
threats
of
the
soldiers
monk
addressed
one
of
these
sailors
what
is
going
on
here
asked
he
sir
replied
the
man
not
recognizing
monk
as
an
officer
under
the
thick
cloak
which
enveloped
him
that
house
was
inhabited
by
a
foreign
gentleman
and
this
foreigner
became
suspected
by
the
soldiers
they
wanted
to
get
into
his
house
under
pretense
of
taking
him
to
the
camp
but
he
without
being
frightened
by
their
number
threatened
death
to
the
first
who
should
cross
the
threshold
of
his
door
and
as
there
was
one
who
did
venture
the
frenchman
stretched
him
on
the
earth
with
a
ah
he
is
a
frenchman
is
he
said
d
artagnan
rubbing
his
hands
good
how
good
replied
the
fisherman
no
i
don
t
mean
what
then
my
tongue
slipped
what
then
sir
why
the
other
men
became
as
enraged
as
so
many
lions
they
fired
more
than
a
hundred
shots
at
the
house
but
the
frenchman
was
sheltered
by
the
wall
and
every
time
they
tried
to
enter
by
the
door
they
met
with
a
shot
from
his
lackey
whose
aim
is
deadly
d
ye
see
every
time
they
threatened
the
window
they
met
with
a
from
the
master
look
and
count
there
are
seven
men
down
ah
my
brave
countryman
cried
d
artagnan
wait
a
little
wait
a
little
i
will
be
with
you
and
we
will
settle
with
this
rabble
one
instant
sir
said
monk
wait
long
no
only
the
time
to
ask
a
question
then
turning
towards
the
sailor
my
friend
asked
he
with
an
emotion
which
in
spite
of
all
his
he
could
not
conceal
whose
soldiers
are
these
pray
tell
me
whose
should
they
be
but
that
madman
monk
s
there
has
been
no
battle
then
a
battle
ah
yes
for
what
purpose
lambert
s
army
is
melting
away
like
snow
in
april
all
come
to
monk
officers
and
soldiers
in
a
week
lambert
won
t
have
fifty
men
left
the
fisherman
was
interrupted
by
a
fresh
discharge
directed
against
the
house
and
by
another
which
replied
to
the
discharge
and
struck
down
the
most
daring
of
the
aggressors
the
rage
of
soldiers
was
at
its
height
the
fire
still
continued
to
increase
and
a
crest
of
flame
and
smoke
whirled
and
spread
over
the
roof
of
the
house
d
artagnan
could
no
longer
contain
himself
mordioux
said
he
to
monk
glancing
at
him
sideways
you
are
a
general
and
allow
your
men
to
burn
houses
and
assassinate
people
while
you
look
on
and
warm
your
hands
at
the
blaze
of
the
conflagration
mordioux
you
are
not
a
man

said
monk
smiling
patience
yes
until
that
brave
gentleman
is
roasted

that
what
you
mean
and
d
artagnan
rushed
forward
remain
where
you
are
sir
said
monk
in
a
tone
of
command
and
he
advanced
towards
the
house
just
as
an
officer
had
approached
it
saying
to
the
besieged
the
house
is
burning
you
will
be
roasted
within
an
hour
there
is
still
time

will

your
life

patrick
the
besieged

no
answer
he
was
no
doubt
reloading
his
pistol
a
reinforcement

continued
the
officer
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
will
be
a
hundred
men
around
your
house
i
reply
to
you
said
the
frenchman
let
your
men
be
sent

i
will
come
out
freely
and
repair
to
the
camp
alone
or
else
i
will
be
killed
here
mille
tonnerres
shouted
d
artagnan
why
that
s
the
voice
of
athos
ah
canailles
and
the
sword
of
d
artagnan
flashed
from
its
sheath
monk
stopped
him
and
advanced
himself
exclaiming
in
a
sonorous
voice
hola
what
is
going
on
here
digby
whence
this
fire
why
these
cries
the
general
cried
digby
letting
the
point
of
his
sword
fall
the
general
repeated
the
soldiers
well
what
is
there
so
astonishing
in
that
said
monk
in
a
calm
tone
then
silence
being
now
said
he
who
lit
this
fire
the
soldiers
hung
their
heads
what
do
i
ask
a
question
and
nobody
answers
me
said
monk
what
do
i
find
a
fault
and
nobody
repairs
it
the
fire
is
still
burning
i
believe
immediately
the
twenty
men
rushed
forward
seizing
pails
buckets
jars
barrels
and
extinguishing
the
fire
with
as
much
ardor
as
they
had
an
instant
before
employed
in
promoting
it
but
already
and
before
all
the
rest
d
artagnan
had
applied
a
ladder
to
the
house
crying
athos
it
is
i
d
artagnan
do
not
kill
me
my
dearest
friend
and
in
a
moment
the
count
was
clasped
in
his
arms
in
the
meantime
grimaud
preserving
his
calmness
dismantled
the
fortification
of
the
and
after
having
opened
the
door
stood
with
his
arms
folded
quietly
on
the
sill
only
on
hearing
the
voice
of
d
artagnan
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
fire
being
extinguished
the
soldiers
presented
themselves
digby
at
their
head
general
said
he
excuse
us
what
we
have
done
was
for
love
of
your
honor
whom
we
thought
lost
you
are
mad
gentlemen
lost
is
a
man
like
me
to
be
lost
am
i
not
permitted
to
be
absent
according
to
my
pleasure
without
giving
formal
notice
do
you
by
chance
take
me
for
a
citizen
from
the
city
is
a
gentleman
my
friend
my
guest
to
be
besieged
entrapped
and
threatened
with
death
because
he
is
suspected
what
signifies
the
word
suspected
curse
me
if
i
don
t
have
every
one
of
you
shot
like
dogs
that
the
brave
gentleman
has
left
alive
general
said
digby
piteously
there
were
of
us
and
see
there
are
eight
on
the
ground
i
authorize
le
comte
de
la
fere
to
send
the
twenty
to
join
the
eight
said
monk
stretching
out
his
hand
to
athos
let
them
return
to
camp
digby
you
will
consider
yourself
under
arrest
for
a
month
general
that
is
to
teach
you
sir
not
to
act
another
time
without
orders
i
had
those
of
the
lieutenant
general
the
lieutenant
had
no
such
orders
to
give
you
and
he
shall
be
placed
under
arrest
instead
of
you
if
he
has
really
commanded
you
to
burn
this
gentleman
he
did
not
command
that
general
he
commanded
us
to
bring
him
to
the
camp
but
the
count
was
not
willing
to
follow
us
i
was
not
willing
that
they
should
enter
and
plunder
my
house
said
athos
to
monk
with
a
significant
look
and
you
were
quite
right
to
the
camp
i
say
the
soldiers
departed
with
dejected
looks
now
we
are
alone
said
monk
to
athos
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
monsieur
why
you
persisted
in
remaining
here
whilst
you
had
your
felucca
i
waited
for
you
general
said
athos
had
not
your
honor
appointed
to
meet
me
in
a
week
an
eloquent
look
from
d
artagnan
made
it
clear
to
monk
that
these
two
men
so
brave
and
so
loyal
had
not
acted
in
concert
for
his
abduction
he
knew
already
it
could
not
be
so
monsieur
said
he
to
d
artagnan
you
were
perfectly
right
have
the
kindness
to
allow
me
a
moment
s
conversation
with
le
comte
de
la
fere
d
artagnan
took
advantage
of
this
to
go
and
ask
grimaud
how
he
was
monk
requested
athos
to
conduct
him
to
the
chamber
he
lived
in
this
chamber
was
still
full
of
smoke
and
rubbish
more
than
fifty
balls
had
passed
through
the
windows
and
mutilated
the
walls
they
found
a
table
inkstand
and
materials
for
writing
monk
took
up
a
pen
wrote
a
single
line
signed
it
folded
the
paper
sealed
the
letter
with
the
seal
of
his
ring
and
handed
over
the
missive
to
athos
saying
monsieur
carry
if
you
please
this
letter
to
king
charles
and
set
out
immediately
if
nothing
detains
you
here
any
longer
and
the
casks
said
athos
the
fisherman
who
brought
me
hither
will
assist
you
in
transporting
them
on
board
depart
if
possible
within
an
hour
yes
general
said
athos
monsieur
d
artagnan
cried
monk
from
the
window
d
artagnan
ran
up
precipitately
embrace
your
friend
and
bid
him
adieu
sir
he
is
returning
to
holland
to
holland
cried
d
artagnan
and
i
you
are
at
liberty
to
follow
him
monsieur
but
i
request
you
to
remain
said
monk
will
you
refuse
me
oh
no
general
i
am
at
your
orders
d
artagnan
embraced
athos
and
only
had
time
to
bid
him
adieu
monk
watched
them
both
then
he
took
upon
himself
the
preparations
for
the
departure
the
transportation
of
the
casks
on
board
and
the
embarking
of
athos
then
taking
d
artagnan
by
the
arm
who
was
quite
amazed
and
agitated
he
led
him
towards
newcastle
whilst
going
along
the
general
leaning
on
his
arm
d
artagnan
could
not
help
murmuring
to
himself
come
come
it
seems
to
me
that
the
shares
of
the
firm
of
planchet
and
company
are
rising
chapter
xxxi
monk
reveals
himself
d
artagnan
although
he
flattered
himself
with
better
success
had
nevertheless
not
too
well
comprehended
his
situation
it
was
a
strange
and
grave
subject
for
him
to
reflect
upon
this
voyage
of
athos
into
england
this
league
of
the
king
with
athos
and
that
extraordinary
combination
of
his
design
with
that
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
the
best
way
was
to
let
things
follow
their
own
train
an
imprudence
had
been
committed
and
whilst
having
succeeded
as
he
had
promised
d
artagnan
found
that
he
had
gained
no
advantage
by
his
success
since
everything
was
lost
he
could
risk
no
more
d
artagnan
followed
monk
through
his
camp
the
return
of
the
general
had
produced
a
marvelous
effect
for
his
people
had
thought
him
lost
but
monk
with
his
austere
look
and
icy
demeanor
appeared
to
ask
of
his
eager
lieutenants
and
delighted
soldiers
the
cause
of
all
this
joy
therefore
to
the
lieutenants
who
had
come
to
meet
him
and
who
expressed
the
uneasiness
with
which
they
had
learnt
his
departure
why
is
all
this
said
he
am
i
obliged
to
give
you
an
account
of
myself
but
your
honor
the
sheep
may
well
tremble
without
the
shepherd
tremble
replied
monk
in
his
calm
and
powerful
voice
ah
monsieur
what
a
word
curse
me
if
my
sheep
have
not
both
teeth
and
claws
i
renounce
being
their
shepherd
ah
you
tremble
gentlemen
do
you
yes
general
for
you
oh
pray
meddle
with
your
own
concerns
if
i
have
not
the
wit
god
gave
to
oliver
cromwell
i
have
that
which
he
has
sent
to
me
i
am
satisfied
with
it
however
little
it
may
be
the
officer
made
no
reply
and
monk
having
imposed
silence
on
his
people
all
remained
persuaded
that
he
had
accomplished
some
important
work
or
made
some
important
trial
this
was
forming
a
very
poor
conception
of
his
patience
and
scrupulous
genius
monk
if
he
had
the
good
faith
of
the
puritans
his
allies
must
have
returned
fervent
thanks
to
the
patron
saint
who
had
taken
him
from
the
box
of
d
artagnan
whilst
these
things
were
going
on
our
musketeer
could
not
help
constantly
repeating
god
grant
that
monk
may
not
have
as
much
pride
as
i
have
for
i
declare
that
if
any
one
had
put
me
into
a
coffer
with
that
grating
over
my
mouth
and
carried
me
packed
up
like
a
calf
across
the
seas
i
should
cherish
such
a
memory
of
my
piteous
looks
in
that
coffer
and
such
an
ugly
animosity
against
him
who
had
inclosed
me
in
it
i
should
dread
so
greatly
to
see
a
sarcastic
smile
blooming
upon
the
face
of
the
malicious
wretch
or
in
his
attitude
any
grotesque
imitation
of
my
position
in
the
box
that
mordioux
i
should
plunge
a
good
dagger
into
his
throat
in
compensation
for
the
grating
and
would
nail
him
down
in
a
veritable
bier
in
remembrance
of
the
false
coffin
in
which
i
had
been
left
in
to
grow
moldy
for
two
days
and
d
artagnan
spoke
honestly
when
he
spoke
thus
for
the
skin
of
our
gascon
was
a
very
thin
one
monk
fortunately
entertained
other
ideas
he
never
opened
his
mouth
to
his
timid
conqueror
concerning
the
past
but
he
admitted
him
very
near
to
his
person
in
his
labors
took
him
with
him
to
several
reconnoiterings
in
such
a
way
as
to
obtain
that
which
he
evidently
warmly
desired
a
rehabilitation
in
the
mind
of
d
artagnan
the
latter
conducted
himself
like
a
in
the
art
of
flattery
he
admired
all
monk
s
tactics
and
the
ordering
of
his
camp
he
joked
very
pleasantly
upon
the
circumvallations
of
lambert
s
camp
who
had
he
said
very
uselessly
given
himself
the
trouble
to
inclose
a
camp
for
twenty
thousand
men
whilst
an
acre
of
ground
would
have
been
quite
sufficient
for
the
corporal
and
fifty
guards
who
would
perhaps
remain
faithful
to
him
monk
immediately
after
his
arrival
had
accepted
the
proposition
made
by
lambert
the
evening
before
for
an
interview
and
which
monk
s
lieutenants
had
refused
under
the
pretext
that
the
general
was
indisposed
this
interview
was
neither
long
nor
interesting
lambert
demanded
a
profession
of
faith
from
his
rival
the
latter
declared
he
had
no
other
opinion
than
that
of
the
majority
lambert
asked
if
it
would
not
be
more
expedient
to
terminate
the
quarrel
by
an
alliance
than
by
a
battle
monk
hereupon
demanded
a
week
for
consideration
now
lambert
could
not
refuse
this
and
lambert
nevertheless
had
come
saying
that
he
should
devour
monk
s
army
therefore
at
the
end
of
the
interview
which
lambert
s
party
watched
with
impatience
nothing
was
decided
neither
treaty
nor
battle
the
rebel
army
as
d
artagnan
had
foreseen
began
to
prefer
the
good
cause
to
the
bad
one
and
the
parliament
rumpish
as
it
was
to
the
pompous
nothings
of
lambert
s
designs
they
remembered
likewise
the
good
feasts
of
london
the
profusion
of
ale
and
sherry
with
which
the
citizens
of
london
paid
their
friends
the
soldiers
they
looked
with
terror
at
the
black
war
bread
at
the
troubled
waters
of
the
tweed
too
salt
for
the
glass
not
enough
so
for
the
pot
and
they
said
to
themselves
are
not
the
roast
meats
kept
warm
for
monk
in
london
from
that
time
nothing
was
heard
of
but
desertion
in
lambert
s
army
the
soldiers
allowed
themselves
to
be
drawn
away
by
the
force
of
principles
which
are
like
discipline
the
obligatory
tie
in
everybody
constituted
for
any
purpose
monk
defended
the
parliament
lambert
attacked
it
monk
had
no
more
inclination
to
support
parliament
than
lambert
but
he
had
it
inscribed
on
his
standards
so
that
all
those
of
the
contrary
party
were
reduced
to
write
upon
theirs
rebellion
which
sounded
ill
to
puritan
ears
they
flocked
then
from
lambert
to
monk
as
sinners
flock
from
baal
to
god
monk
made
his
calculations
at
a
thousand
desertions
a
day
lambert
had
men
enough
to
last
twenty
days
but
there
is
in
sinking
things
such
a
growth
of
weight
and
swiftness
which
combine
with
each
other
that
a
hundred
left
the
first
day
five
hundred
the
second
a
thousand
the
third
monk
thought
he
had
obtained
his
rate
but
from
one
thousand
the
deserters
increased
to
two
thousand
then
to
four
thousand
and
a
week
after
lambert
perceiving
that
he
had
no
longer
the
possibility
of
accepting
battle
if
it
were
offered
to
him
took
the
wise
resolution
of
decamping
during
the
night
returning
to
london
and
being
beforehand
with
monk
in
constructing
a
power
with
the
wreck
of
the
military
party
but
monk
free
and
without
uneasiness
marched
towards
london
as
a
conqueror
augmenting
his
army
with
all
the
floating
parties
on
the
way
he
encamped
at
barnet
that
is
to
say
within
four
leagues
of
the
capital
cherished
by
the
parliament
which
thought
it
beheld
in
him
a
protector
and
awaited
by
the
people
who
were
anxious
to
see
him
reveal
himself
that
they
might
judge
him
d
artagnan
himself
had
not
been
able
to
fathom
his
tactics
he
observed
he
admired
monk
could
not
enter
london
with
a
settled
determination
without
bringing
about
civil
war
he
temporized
for
a
short
time
suddenly
when
least
expected
monk
drove
the
military
party
out
of
london
and
installed
himself
in
the
city
amidst
the
citizens
by
order
of
the
parliament
then
at
the
moment
when
the
citizens
were
crying
out
against
monk
at
the
moment
when
the
soldiers
themselves
were
accusing
their
leader
monk
finding
himself
certain
of
a
majority
declared
to
the
rump
parliament
that
it
must
abdicate
be
dissolved
and
yield
its
place
to
a
government
which
would
not
be
a
joke
monk
pronounced
this
declaration
supported
by
fifty
thousand
swords
to
which
that
same
evening
were
united
with
shouts
of
delirious
joy
the
five
thousand
inhabitants
of
the
good
city
of
london
at
length
at
the
moment
when
the
people
after
their
triumphs
and
festive
repasts
in
the
open
streets
were
looking
about
for
a
master
it
was
affirmed
that
a
vessel
had
left
the
hague
bearing
king
charles
ii
and
his
fortunes
gentlemen
said
monk
to
his
officers
i
am
going
to
meet
the
legitimate
king
he
who
loves
me
will
follow
me
a
burst
of
acclamations
welcomed
these
words
which
d
artagnan
did
not
hear
without
the
greatest
delight
mordioux
said
he
to
monk
that
is
bold
monsieur
you
will
accompany
me
will
you
not
said
monk
pardieu
general
but
tell
me
i
beg
what
you
wrote
by
athos
that
is
to
say
the
comte
de
la
fere
you
know
the
day
of
our
arrival
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
now
replied
monk
i
wrote
these
words
sire
i
expect
your
majesty
in
six
weeks
at
ah
said
d
artagnan
i
no
longer
say
it
is
bold
i
say
it
is
well
played
it
is
a
fine
stroke
you
are
something
of
a
judge
in
such
matters
replied
monk
and
this
was
the
only
time
the
general
had
ever
made
an
allusion
to
his
voyage
to
holland

great
pomp
as
he
afterwards
did
in
london
he
had
sent
for
his
brothers
he
had
brought
over
his
mother
and
sister
england
had
been
for
so
long
a
time
given
up
to
herself
that
is
to
say
to
tyranny
mediocrity
and
nonsense
that
this
return
of
charles
whom
the
english
only
knew
as
the
son
of
the
man
whose
head
they
had
cut
off
was
a
festival
for
three
kingdoms
consequently
all
the
good
wishes
all
the
acclamations
which
accompanied
his
return
struck
the
young
king
so
forcibly
that
he
stooped
and
whispered
in
the
ear
of
james
of
york
his
younger
brother
in
truth
james
it
seems
to
have
been
our
own
fault
that
we
were
so
long
absent
from
a
country
where
we
are
so
much
beloved
the
pageant
was
magnificent
beautiful
weather
favored
the
solemnity
charles
had
regained
all
his
youth
all
his
good
humor
he
appeared
to
be
transfigured
hearts
seemed
to
smile
on
him
like
the
sun
amongst
this
noisy
crowd
of
courtiers
and
worshipers
who
did
not
appear
to
remember
they
had
conducted
to
the
scaffold
at
whitehall
the
father
of
the
new
king
a
man
in
the
garb
of
a
lieutenant
of
musketeers
looked
with
a
smile
upon
his
thin
intellectual
lips
sometimes
at
the
people
vociferating
their
blessings
and
sometimes
at
the
prince
who
pretended
emotion
and
who
bowed
most
particularly
to
the
women
whose
bouquets
fell
beneath
his
horse
s
feet
what
a
fine
trade
is
that
of
king
said
this
man
so
completely
absorbed
in
contemplation
that
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
leaving
the
cortege
to
file
past
now
there
is
in
good
truth
a
prince
all
bespangled
over
with
gold
and
diamonds
enamelled
with
flowers
like
a
spring
meadow
he
is
about
to
plunge
his
empty
hands
into
the
immense
coffer
in
which
his
now
faithful
but
so
lately
unfaithful
subjects
have
amassed
one
or
two
cartloads
of
ingots
of
gold
they
cast
bouquets
enough
upon
him
to
smother
him
and
yet
if
he
had
presented
himself
to
them
two
months
ago
they
would
have
sent
as
many
bullets
and
balls
at
him
as
they
now
throw
flowers
decidedly
it
is
worth
something
to
be
born
in
a
certain
sphere
with
due
respect
to
the
lowly
who
pretend
that
it
is
of
very
little
advantage
to
them
to
be
born
lowly
the
cortege
continued
to
file
on
and
with
the
king
the
acclamations
began
to
die
away
in
the
direction
of
the
palace
which
however
did
not
prevent
our
officer
from
being
pushed
about
mordioux
continued
the
reasoner
these
people
tread
upon
my
toes
and
look
upon
me
as
of
very
little
consequence
or
rather
of
none
at
all
seeing
that
they
are
englishmen
and
i
am
a
frenchman
if
all
these
people
were
asked
who
is
d
artagnan
they
would
reply
nescio
but
let
any
one
say
to
them
there
is
the
king
going
by
there
is
monk
going
by
they
would
run
away
shouting
vive
le
roi
vive
monk
till
their
lungs
were
exhausted
and
yet
continued
he
surveying
with
that
look
sometimes
so
keen
and
sometimes
so
proud
the
diminishing
crowd
and
yet
reflect
a
little
my
good
people
on
what
your
king
has
done
on
what
monk
has
done
and
then
think
what
has
been
done
by
this
poor
unknown
who
is
called
d
artagnan
it
is
true
you
do
not
know
him
since
he
is
here
unknown
and
that
prevents
your
thinking
about
the
matter
but
bah
what
matters
it
all
that
does
not
prevent
charles
ii
from
being
a
great
king
although
he
has
been
exiled
twelve
years
or
monk
from
being
a
great
captain
although
he
did
make
a
voyage
to
holland
in
a
box
well
then
since
it
is
admitted
that
one
is
a
great
king
and
the
other
a
great
captain
hurrah
for
king
charles
ii
hurrah
for
general
monk
and
his
voice
mingled
with
the
voices
of
the
hundreds
of
spectators
over
which
it
sounded
for
a
moment
then
the
better
to
play
the
devoted
man
he
took
off
his
hat
and
waved
it
in
the
air
some
one
seized
his
arm
in
the
very
height
of
his
expansive
loyalism
in
that
was
so
termed
which
we
now
call
royalism
athos
cried
d
artagnan
you
here
and
the
two
friends
seized
each
other
s
hands
you
here
and
being
here
continued
the
musketeer
you
are
not
in
the
midst
of
all
these
courtiers
my
dear
comte
what
you
the
hero
of
the
fete
you
are
not
prancing
on
the
left
hand
of
the
king
as
monk
is
prancing
on
the
right
in
truth
i
can
not
comprehend
your
character
nor
that
of
the
prince
who
owes
you
so
much
always
scornful
my
dear
d
artagnan
said
athos
will
you
never
correct
yourself
of
that
vile
habit
but
you
do
not
form
part
of
the
pageant
i
do
not
because
i
was
not
willing
to
do
so
and
why
were
you
not
willing
because
i
am
neither
envoy
nor
ambassador
nor
representative
of
the
king
of
france
and
it
does
not
become
me
to
exhibit
myself
thus
near
the
person
of
another
king
than
the
one
god
has
given
me
for
a
master
mordioux
you
came
very
near
to
the
person
of
the
king
his
father
that
was
another
thing
my
friend
he
was
about
to
die
and
yet
that
which
you
did
for
him
i
did
it
because
it
was
my
duty
to
do
it
but
you
know
i
hate
all
ostentation
let
king
charles
then
who
no
longer
stands
in
need
of
me
leave
me
to
my
rest
and
the
shadow
that
is
all
i
claim
of
him
d
artagnan
sighed
what
is
the
matter
with
you
said
athos
one
would
say
that
this
happy
return
of
the
king
to
london
saddens
you
my
friend
you
who
have
done
at
least
as
much
for
his
majesty
as
i
have
have
i
not
replied
d
artagnan
with
his
gascon
laugh
have
i
not
done
much
for
his
majesty
without
any
one
suspecting
it
yes
yes
but
the
king
is
well
aware
of
it
my
friend
cried
athos
he
is
aware
of
it
said
the
musketeer
bitterly
by
my
faith
i
did
not
suspect
so
and
i
was
even
a
moment
ago
trying
to
forget
it
myself
but
he
my
friend
will
not
forget
it
i
will
answer
for
him
you
tell
me
that
to
console
me
a
little
athos
for
what
mordioux
for
all
the
expense
i
incurred
i
have
ruined
myself
my
friend
ruined
myself
for
the
restoration
of
this
young
prince
who
has
just
passed
cantering
on
his
isabelle
colored
horse
the
king
does
not
know
you
have
ruined
yourself
my
friend
but
he
knows
he
owes
you
much
and
say
athos
does
that
advance
me
in
any
respect
for
to
do
you
justice
you
have
labored
nobly
but
i
i
who
in
appearance
marred
your
combinations
it
was
i
who
really
made
them
succeed
follow
my
calculations
closely
you
might
not
have
by
persuasions
or
mildness
convinced
general
monk
whilst
i
so
roughly
treated
this
dear
general
that
i
furnished
your
prince
with
an
opportunity
of
showing
himself
generous
this
generosity
was
inspired
in
him
by
the
fact
of
my
fortunate
mistake
and
charles
is
paid
by
the
restoration
which
monk
has
brought
about
all
that
my
dear
friend
is
strikingly
true
replied
athos
well
strikingly
true
as
it
may
be
it
is
not
less
true
my
friend
that
i
shall
return
greatly
beloved
by
monk
who
calls
me
dear
captain
all
day
long
although
i
am
neither
dear
to
him
nor
a
captain
and
much
appreciated
by
the
king
who
has
already
forgotten
my
name
it
is
not
less
true
i
say
that
i
shall
return
to
my
beautiful
country
cursed
by
the
soldiers
i
had
raised
with
the
hopes
of
large
pay
cursed
by
the
brave
planchet
of
who
i
have
borrowed
a
part
of
his
fortune
how
is
that
what
the
devil
had
planchet
to
do
in
all
this
ah
yes
my
friend
but
this
king
so
spruce
so
smiling
so
adored
monk
fancies
he
has
recalled
him
you
fancy
you
have
supported
him
i
fancy
i
have
brought
him
back
the
people
fancy
they
have
reconquered
him
he
himself
fancies
he
has
negotiated
his
restoration
and
yet
nothing
of
all
this
is
true
for
charles
king
of
england
scotland
and
ireland
has
been
replaced
upon
the
throne
by
a
french
grocer
who
lives
in
the
rue
des
lombards
and
is
named
planchet
and
such
is
grandeur
vanity
says
the
scripture
vanity
all
is
athos
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
whimsical
outbreak
of
his
friend
my
dear
d
artagnan
said
he
pressing
his
hand
affectionately
should
you
not
exercise
a
little
more
philosophy
is
it
not
some
further
satisfaction
to
you
to
have
saved
my
life
as
you
did
by
arriving
so
fortunately
with
monk
when
those
damned
parliamentarians
wanted
to
burn
me
alive
well
but
you
in
some
degree
deserved
a
little
burning
my
friend
how
so
what
for
having
saved
king
charles
s
million
what
million
ah
that
is
true
you
never
knew
that
my
friend
but
you
must
not
be
angry
for
it
was
my
secret
that
word
remember
which
the
king
pronounced
upon
the
scaffold
and
which
means
exactly
that
was
signified
remember
there
is
a
million
buried
in
the
vaults
of
newcastle
abbey
and
that
that
million
belongs
to
my
ah
very
well
i
understand
but
what
i
understand
likewise
and
what
is
very
frightful
is
that
every
time
his
majesty
charles
ii
will
think
of
me
he
will
say
to
himself
there
is
the
man
who
came
very
near
to
making
me
lose
my
crown
fortunately
i
was
generous
great
full
of
presence
of
that
will
be
said
by
the
young
gentleman
in
a
shabby
black
doublet
who
came
to
the
chateau
of
blois
hat
in
hand
to
ask
me
if
i
would
give
him
access
to
the
king
of
france
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
said
athos
laying
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
musketeer
you
are
unjust
i
have
a
right
to
be
so
no
for
you
are
ignorant
of
the
future
d
artagnan
looked
his
friend
full
in
the
face
and
began
to
laugh
in
truth
my
dear
athos
said
he
you
have
some
sayings
so
superb
that
they
only
belong
to
you
and
le
cardinal
mazarin
athos
frowned
slightly
i
beg
your
pardon
continued
d
artagnan
laughing
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
have
offended
you
the
future
nein
what
pretty
words
are
words
that
promise
and
how
well
they
fill
the
mouth
in
default
of
other
things
mordioux
after
having
met
with
so
many
who
promised
when
shall
i
find
one
who
will
give
but
let
that
pass
continued
d
artagnan
what
are
you
doing
here
my
dear
athos
are
you
the
king
s
treasurer
how
why
the
king
s
treasurer
well
since
the
king
possess
a
million
he
must
want
a
treasurer
the
king
of
france
although
he
is
not
worth
a
sou
has
still
a
superintendent
of
finance
fouquet
it
is
true
that
in
exchange
fouquet
they
say
has
a
good
number
of
millions
of
his
own
oh
our
million
was
spent
long
ago
said
athos
laughing
in
his
turn
i
understand
it
was
frittered
away
in
satin
precious
stones
velvet
and
feathers
of
all
sorts
and
colors
all
these
princes
and
princesses
stood
in
great
need
of
tailors
and
dressmakers
eh
athos
do
you
remember
what
we
fellows
spent
in
equipping
ourselves
for
the
campaign
of
la
rochelle
and
to
make
our
appearance
on
horseback
two
or
three
thousand
livres
by
my
faith
but
a
king
s
robe
is
the
more
ample
it
would
require
a
million
to
purchase
the
stuff
at
least
athos
if
you
are
not
treasurer
you
are
on
good
footing
at
court
by
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
athos
simply
what
you
know
nothing
about
it
no
i
have
not
seen
the
king
since
we
left
dover
then
he
has
forgotten
you
too
mordioux
that
is
shameful
his
majesty
has
had
so
much
business
to
transact
oh
cried
d
artagnan
with
one
of
those
intelligent
grimaces
which
he
alone
knew
how
to
make
that
is
enough
to
make
me
recover
my
love
for
monseigneur
giulio
mazarini
what
athos
the
king
has
not
seen
you
since
then
no
and
you
are
not
furious
i
why
should
i
be
do
you
imagine
my
dear
d
artagnan
that
it
was
on
the
king
s
account
i
acted
as
i
have
done
i
did
not
know
the
young
man
i
defended
the
father
who
represented
a
principle
sacred
in
my
eyes
and
i
allowed
myself
to
be
drawn
towards
the
son
from
sympathy
for
this
same
principle
besides
he
was
a
worthy
knight
a
noble
creature
that
father
do
you
remember
him
yes
that
is
true
he
was
a
brave
an
excellent
man
who
led
a
sad
life
but
made
a
fine
end
well
my
dear
d
artagnan
understand
this
to
that
king
to
that
man
of
heart
to
that
friend
of
my
thoughts
if
i
durst
venture
to
say
so
i
swore
at
the
last
hour
to
preserve
faithfully
the
secret
of
a
deposit
which
was
to
be
transmitted
to
his
son
to
assist
him
in
his
hour
of
need
this
young
man
came
to
me
he
described
his
destitution
he
was
ignorant
that
he
was
anything
to
me
save
a
living
memory
of
his
father
i
have
accomplished
towards
charles
ii
what
i
promised
charles
that
is
all
of
what
consequence
is
it
to
me
then
whether
he
be
grateful
or
not
it
is
to
myself
i
have
rendered
a
service
by
relieving
myself
of
this
responsibility
and
not
to
him
well
i
have
always
said
replied
d
artagnan
with
a
sigh
that
disinterestedness
was
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
well
and
you
my
friend
resumed
athos
are
you
not
in
the
same
situation
as
myself
if
i
have
properly
understood
your
words
you
allowed
yourself
to
be
affected
by
the
misfortunes
of
this
young
man
that
on
your
part
was
much
greater
than
it
was
upon
mine
for
i
had
a
duty
to
fulfill
whilst
you
were
under
no
obligation
to
the
son
of
the
martyr
you
had
not
on
your
part
to
pay
him
the
price
of
that
precious
drop
of
blood
which
he
let
fall
upon
my
brow
through
the
floor
of
the
scaffold
that
which
made
you
act
was
heart
alone
the
noble
and
good
heart
which
you
possess
beneath
your
apparent
skepticism
and
sarcastic
irony
you
have
engaged
the
fortune
of
a
servitor
and
your
own
i
suspect
my
benevolent
miser
and
your
sacrifice
is
not
acknowledged
of
what
consequence
is
it
you
wish
to
repay
planchet
his
money
i
can
comprehend
that
my
friend
for
it
is
not
becoming
in
a
gentleman
to
borrow
from
his
inferior
without
returning
to
him
principal
and
interest
well
i
will
sell
la
fere
if
necessary
and
if
not
some
little
farm
you
shall
pay
planchet
and
there
will
be
enough
believe
me
of
corn
left
in
my
granaries
for
us
two
and
raoul
in
this
way
my
friend
you
will
be
under
obligations
to
nobody
but
yourself
and
if
i
know
you
well
it
will
not
be
a
small
satisfaction
to
your
mind
to
be
able
to
say
i
have
made
a
king
am
i
right
athos
athos
murmured
d
artagnan
thoughtfully
i
have
told
you
more
than
once
that
the
day
on
which
you
will
preach
i
shall
attend
the
sermon
the
day
on
which
you
will
tell
me
there
is
a
hell
mordioux
i
shall
be
afraid
of
the
gridiron
and
the
you
are
better
than
i
or
rather
better
than
anybody
and
i
only
acknowledge
the
possession
of
one
quality
and
that
is
of
not
being
jealous
except
that
defect
damme
as
the
english
say
if
i
have
not
all
the
rest
i
know
no
one
equal
to
d
artagnan
replied
athos
but
here
we
are
having
quietly
reached
the
house
i
inhabit
will
you
come
in
my
friend
eh
why
this
is
the
tavern
of
the
corne
du
cerf
i
think
said
d
artagnan
i
confess
i
chose
it
on
purpose
i
like
old
acquaintances
i
like
to
sit
down
on
that
place
whereon
i
sank
overcome
by
fatigue
overwhelmed
by
despair
when
you
returned
on
the
of
january
after
having
discovered
the
abode
of
the
masked
executioner
yes
that
was
a
terrible
day
come
in
then
said
athos
interrupting
him
they
entered
the
large
apartment
formerly
the
common
one
the
tavern
in
general
and
this
room
in
particular
had
undergone
great
changes
the
ancient
host
of
the
musketeers
having
become
tolerably
rich
for
an
innkeeper
had
closed
his
shop
and
make
of
this
room
of
which
we
were
speaking
a
for
colonial
provisions
as
for
the
rest
of
the
house
he
let
it
ready
furnished
to
strangers
it
was
with
unspeakable
emotion
d
artagnan
recognized
all
the
furniture
of
the
chamber
of
the
first
story
the
wainscoting
the
tapestries
and
even
that
geographical
chart
which
porthos
had
so
fondly
studied
in
his
moments
of
leisure
it
is
eleven
years
ago
cried
d
artagnan
mordioux
it
appears
to
me
a
century
and
to
me
but
a
day
said
athos
imagine
the
joy
i
experience
my
friend
in
seeing
you
there
in
pressing
your
hand
in
casting
from
me
sword
and
dagger
and
tasting
without
mistrust
this
glass
of
sherry
and
oh
what
still
further
joy
it
would
be
if
our
two
friends
were
there
at
the
two
corners
of
the
table
and
raoul
my
beloved
raoul
on
the
threshold
looking
at
us
with
his
large
eyes
at
once
so
brilliant
and
so
soft
yes
yes
said
d
artagnan
much
affected
that
is
true
i
approve
particularly
of
the
first
part
of
your
thought
it
is
very
pleasant
to
smile
there
where
we
have
so
legitimately
shuddered
in
thinking
that
from
one
moment
to
another
mordaunt
might
appear
upon
the
landing
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
d
artagnan
brave
as
he
was
could
not
restrain
a
slight
movement
of
fright
athos
understood
him
and
smiling
it
is
our
host
said
he
bringing
me
a
letter
yes
my
lord
said
the
good
man
here
is
a
letter
for
your
honor
thank
you
said
athos
taking
the
letter
without
looking
at
it
tell
me
my
dear
host
if
you
do
not
remember
this
gentleman
the
old
man
raised
his
head
and
looked
attentively
at
d
artagnan
no
said
he
it
is
said
athos
one
of
those
friends
of
whom
i
have
spoken
to
you
and
who
lodged
here
with
me
eleven
years
ago
oh
but
said
the
old
man
so
many
strangers
have
lodged
here
but
we
lodged
here
on
the
of
january
added
athos
believing
he
should
stimulate
the
lazy
memory
of
the
host
by
this
remark
that
is
very
possible
replied
he
smiling
but
it
is
so
long
ago
and
he
bowed
and
went
out
thank
you
said
d
artagnan
perform
exploits
accomplish
revolutions
endeavor
to
engrave
your
name
in
stone
or
bronze
with
strong
swords
there
is
something
more
rebellious
more
hard
more
forgetful
than
iron
bronze
or
stone
and
that
is
the
brain
of
a
keeper
who
has
grown
rich
in
the
trade
he
does
not
know
me
well
i
should
have
known
him
though
athos
smiling
at
his
friend
s
philosophy
unsealed
his
letter
ah
said
he
a
letter
from
parry
oh
oh
said
d
artagnan
read
it
my
friend
read
it
no
doubt
it
contains
news
athos
shook
his
head
and
read
monsieur
le
the
king
has
experienced
much
regret
at
not
seeing
you
beside
him
at
his
entrance
his
majesty
commands
me
to
say
so
and
to
recall
him
to
your
memory
his
majesty
will
expect
you
this
evening
at
the
palace
of
james
between
nine
and
ten
o
clock
i
am
respectfully
monsieur
le
comte
your
honor
s
very
humble
and
very
obedient
servant
parry
you
see
my
dear
d
artagnan
said
athos
we
must
not
despair
of
the
hearts
of
kings
not
despair
you
are
right
to
say
so
replied
d
artagnan
oh
my
dear
very
dear
friend
resumed
athos
whom
the
almost
imperceptible
bitterness
of
d
artagnan
had
not
escaped
pardon
me
can
i
have
unintentionally
wounded
my
best
comrade
you
are
mad
athos
and
to
prove
it
i
shall
conduct
you
to
the
palace
to
the
very
gate
i
mean
the
walk
will
do
me
good
you
shall
go
in
with
me
my
friend
i
will
speak
to
his
majesty
no
no
replied
d
artagnan
with
true
pride
free
from
all
mixture
if
there
is
anything
worse
than
begging
yourself
it
is
making
others
beg
for
you
come
let
us
go
my
friend
the
walk
will
be
charming
on
the
way
i
shall
show
you
the
house
of
monk
who
has
detained
me
with
him
a
beautiful
house
by
my
faith
being
a
general
in
england
is
better
than
being
a
marechal
in
france
please
to
know
athos
allowed
himself
to
be
led
along
quite
saddened
by
d
artagnan
s
forced
attempts
at
gayety
the
whole
city
was
in
a
state
of
joy
the
two
friends
were
jostled
at
every
moment
by
enthusiasts
who
required
them
in
their
intoxication
to
cry
out
long
live
good
king
charles
d
artagnan
replied
by
a
grunt
and
athos
by
a
smile
they
arrived
thus
in
front
of
monk
s
house
before
which
as
we
have
said
they
had
to
pass
on
their
way
to
james
s
athos
and
d
artagnan
said
but
little
on
the
road
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
would
have
had
so
many
things
to
talk
about
if
they
had
spoken
athos
thought
that
by
speaking
he
should
evince
satisfaction
and
that
might
wound
d
artagnan
the
latter
feared
that
in
speaking
he
should
allow
some
little
bitterness
to
steal
into
his
words
which
would
render
his
company
unpleasant
to
his
friend
it
was
a
singular
emulation
of
silence
between
contentment
and
d
artagnan
gave
way
first
to
that
itching
at
the
tip
of
his
tongue
which
he
so
habitually
experienced
do
you
remember
athos
said
he
the
passage
of
the
memoires
de
d
aubigny
in
which
that
devoted
servant
a
gascon
like
myself
poor
as
myself
and
i
was
going
to
add
brave
as
myself
relates
instances
of
the
meanness
of
henry
my
father
always
told
me
i
remember
that
d
aubigny
was
a
liar
but
nevertheless
examine
how
all
the
princes
the
issue
of
the
great
henry
keep
up
the
character
of
the
race
nonsense
said
athos
the
kings
of
france
misers
you
are
mad
my
friend
oh
you
are
so
perfect
yourself
you
never
agree
to
the
faults
of
others
but
in
reality
henry
iv
was
covetous
louis
his
son
was
so
likewise
we
know
something
of
that
don
t
we
gaston
carried
this
vice
to
exaggeration
and
has
made
himself
in
this
respect
hated
by
all
who
surround
him
henriette
poor
woman
might
well
be
avaricious
she
who
did
not
eat
every
day
and
could
not
warm
herself
every
winter
and
that
is
an
example
she
has
given
to
her
son
charles
grandson
of
the
great
henry
who
is
as
covetous
as
his
mother
and
his
grandfather
see
if
i
have
well
traced
the
genealogy
of
the
misers
d
artagnan
my
friend
cried
athos
you
are
very
rude
towards
that
eagle
race
called
the
bourbons
eh
and
i
have
forgotten
the
best
instance
of
all
the
other
grandson
of
the
bernais
louis
my
well
i
hope
he
is
miserly
enough
he
who
would
not
lend
a
million
to
his
brother
charles
good
i
see
you
are
beginning
to
be
angry
here
we
are
by
good
luck
close
to
my
house
or
rather
that
of
my
friend
m
monk
my
dear
d
artagnan
you
do
not
make
me
angry
you
make
me
sad
it
is
cruel
in
fact
to
see
a
man
of
your
deserts
out
of
the
position
his
services
ought
to
have
acquired
it
appears
to
me
my
dear
friend
that
your
name
is
as
radiant
as
the
greatest
names
in
war
and
diplomacy
tell
me
if
the
luynes
the
ballegardes
and
the
bassompierres
have
merited
as
we
have
fortunes
and
honors
you
are
right
my
friend
a
hundred
times
right
d
artagnan
sighed
and
preceded
his
friend
under
the
porch
of
he
mansion
monk
inhabited
at
the
extremity
of
the
city
permit
me
said
he
to
leave
my
purse
at
home
for
if
in
the
crowd
those
clever
pickpockets
of
london
who
are
much
boasted
of
even
in
paris
were
to
steal
from
me
the
remainder
of
my
poor
crowns
i
should
not
be
able
to
return
to
france
now
content
i
left
france
and
wild
with
joy
i
should
return
to
it
seeing
that
all
my
prejudices
of
former
days
against
england
have
returned
accompanied
by
many
others
athos
made
no
reply
so
then
my
dear
friend
one
second
and
i
will
follow
you
said
d
artagnan
i
know
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
go
yonder
to
receive
your
reward
but
believe
me
i
am
not
less
eager
to
partake
of
your
joy
although
from
a
distance
wait
for
me
and
d
artagnan
was
already
passing
through
the
vestibule
when
a
man
half
servant
half
soldier
who
filled
in
monk
s
establishment
the
double
function
of
porter
and
guard
stopped
our
musketeer
saying
to
him
in
english
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
d
artagnan
well
replied
the
latter
what
is
it
is
the
general
going
to
dismiss
me
i
only
needed
to
be
expelled
by
him
these
words
spoken
in
french
made
no
impression
upon
the
person
to
whom
they
were
addressed
and
who
himself
only
spoke
an
english
mixed
with
the
rudest
scots
but
athos
was
grieved
at
them
for
he
began
to
think
d
artagnan
was
not
wrong
the
englishman
showed
d
artagnan
a
letter
from
the
general
said
he
aye
that
s
it
my
dismissal
replied
the
gascon
must
i
read
it
athos
you
must
be
deceived
said
athos
or
i
know
no
more
honest
people
in
the
world
but
you
and
myself
d
artagnan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
unsealed
the
letter
while
the
impassible
englishman
held
for
him
a
large
lantern
by
the
light
of
which
he
was
enabled
to
read
it
well
what
is
the
matter
said
athos
seeing
the
countenance
of
the
reader
change
read
it
yourself
said
the
musketeer
athos
took
the
paper
and
read
monsieur
d
the
king
regrets
very
much
you
did
not
come
to
paul
s
with
his
cortege
he
missed
you
as
i
also
have
missed
you
my
dear
captain
there
is
but
one
means
of
repairing
all
this
his
majesty
expects
me
at
nine
o
clock
at
the
palace
of
james
s
will
you
be
there
at
the
same
time
with
me
his
gracious
majesty
appoints
that
hour
for
an
audience
he
grants
you
this
letter
was
from
monk
chapter
xxxiii
the
audience
well
cried
athos
with
a
mild
look
of
reproach
when
d
artagnan
had
read
the
letter
addressed
to
him
by
monk
well
said
d
artagnan
red
with
pleasure
and
a
little
with
shame
at
having
so
hastily
accused
the
king
and
monk
this
is
a
politeness
which
leads
to
nothing
it
is
true
but
yet
it
is
a
politeness
i
had
great
difficulty
in
believing
the
young
prince
ungrateful
said
athos
the
fact
is
that
his
present
is
still
too
near
his
past
replied
d
artagnan
after
all
everything
to
the
present
moment
proved
me
right
i
acknowledge
it
my
dear
friend
i
acknowledge
it
ah
there
is
your
cheerful
look
returned
you
can
not
think
how
delighted
i
am
thus
you
see
said
d
artagnan
charles
ii
receives
monk
at
nine
o
clock
he
will
receive
me
at
ten
it
is
a
grand
audience
of
the
sort
which
at
the
louvre
are
called
distributions
of
court
holy
come
let
us
go
and
place
ourselves
under
the
spout
my
dear
friend
come
along
athos
replied
nothing
and
both
directed
their
steps
at
a
quick
pace
towards
the
palace
of
james
s
which
the
crowd
still
surrounded
to
catch
through
the
windows
the
shadows
of
the
courtiers
and
the
reflection
of
the
royal
person
eight
o
clock
was
striking
when
the
two
friends
took
their
places
in
the
gallery
filled
with
courtiers
and
politicians
every
one
looked
at
these
men
in
foreign
costumes
at
these
two
noble
heads
so
full
of
character
and
meaning
on
their
side
athos
and
d
artagnan
having
with
two
glances
taken
the
measure
of
the
whole
assembly
resumed
their
chat
a
great
noise
was
suddenly
heard
at
the
extremity
of
the
gallery
it
was
general
monk
who
entered
followed
by
more
than
twenty
officers
all
eager
for
a
smile
as
only
the
evening
before
he
was
master
of
all
england
and
a
glorious
was
looked
to
for
the
restorer
of
the
stuart
family
gentlemen
said
monk
turning
round
henceforward
i
beg
you
to
remember
that
i
am
no
longer
anything
lately
i
commanded
the
principal
army
of
the
republic
now
that
army
is
the
king
s
into
whose
hands
i
am
about
to
surrender
at
his
command
my
power
of
yesterday
great
surprise
was
painted
on
all
the
countenances
and
the
circle
of
adulators
and
suppliants
which
surrounded
monk
an
instant
before
was
enlarged
by
degrees
and
ended
by
being
lost
in
the
large
undulations
of
the
crowd
monk
was
going
into
the
as
others
did
d
artagnan
could
not
help
remarking
this
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
who
frowned
on
beholding
it
suddenly
the
door
of
the
royal
apartment
opened
and
the
young
king
appeared
preceded
by
two
officers
of
his
household
good
evening
gentlemen
said
he
is
general
monk
here
i
am
here
sire
replied
the
old
general
charles
stepped
hastily
towards
him
and
seized
his
hand
with
the
warmest
demonstration
of
friendship
general
said
the
king
aloud
i
have
just
signed
your
patent
you
are
duke
of
albemarle
and
my
intention
is
that
no
one
shall
equal
you
in
power
and
fortune
in
this
kingdom
where
the
noble
montrose
excepted
no
one
has
equaled
you
in
loyalty
courage
and
talent
gentlemen
the
duke
is
commander
of
our
armies
of
land
and
sea
pay
him
your
respects
if
you
please
in
that
character
whilst
every
one
was
pressing
round
the
general
who
received
all
this
homage
without
losing
his
impassibility
for
an
instant
d
artagnan
said
to
athos
when
one
thinks
that
this
duchy
this
commander
of
the
land
and
sea
forces
all
these
grandeurs
in
a
word
have
been
shut
up
in
a
box
six
feet
long
and
three
feet
wide
my
friend
replied
athos
much
more
imposing
grandeurs
are
confined
in
boxes
still
smaller
and
remain
there
forever
all
at
once
monk
perceived
the
two
gentlemen
who
held
themselves
aside
until
the
crowd
had
diminished
he
made
himself
a
passage
towards
them
so
that
he
surprised
them
in
the
midst
of
their
philosophical
reflections
were
you
speaking
of
me
sad
he
with
a
smile
my
lord
replied
athos
we
were
speaking
likewise
of
god
monk
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
gayly
gentlemen
let
us
speak
a
little
of
the
king
likewise
if
you
please
for
you
have
i
believe
an
audience
of
his
majesty
at
nine
o
clock
said
athos
at
ten
o
clock
said
d
artagnan
let
us
go
into
this
closet
at
once
replied
monk
making
a
sign
to
his
two
companions
to
precede
him
but
to
that
neither
would
consent
the
king
during
this
discussion
so
characteristic
of
the
french
had
returned
to
the
center
of
the
gallery
oh
my
frenchmen
said
he
in
that
tone
of
careless
gayety
which
in
spite
of
so
much
grief
and
so
many
crosses
he
had
never
lost
my
frenchmen
my
consolation
athos
and
d
artagnan
bowed
duke
conduct
these
gentlemen
into
my
study
i
am
at
your
service
messieurs
added
he
in
french
and
he
promptly
expedited
his
court
to
return
to
his
frenchmen
as
he
called
them
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
he
as
he
entered
his
closet
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
sire
my
joy
is
at
its
height
at
having
the
honor
to
salute
your
majesty
in
your
own
palace
of
st
james
s
monsieur
you
have
been
willing
to
render
me
a
great
service
and
i
owe
you
my
gratitude
for
it
if
i
did
not
fear
to
intrude
upon
the
rights
of
our
command
general
i
would
offer
you
some
post
worthy
of
you
near
our
person
sire
replied
d
artagnan
i
have
quitted
the
service
of
the
king
of
france
making
a
promise
to
my
prince
not
to
serve
any
other
king
humph
said
charles
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
i
should
like
to
do
much
for
you
i
like
you
very
much
sire
but
let
us
see
said
charles
with
a
smile
if
we
can
not
make
you
break
your
word
duke
assist
me
if
you
were
offered
that
is
to
say
if
i
offered
you
the
chief
command
of
my
musketeers
d
artagnan
bowed
lower
than
before
i
should
have
the
regret
to
refuse
what
your
gracious
majesty
would
offer
me
said
he
a
gentleman
has
but
his
word
and
that
word
as
i
have
had
the
honor
to
tell
your
majesty
is
engaged
to
the
king
of
france
we
shall
say
no
more
about
it
then
said
the
king
turning
towards
athos
and
leaving
d
artagnan
plunged
in
the
deepest
pangs
of
disappointment
ah
i
said
so
muttered
the
musketeer
words
words
court
holy
water
kings
have
always
a
marvelous
talent
for
offering
us
that
which
they
know
we
will
not
accept
and
in
appearing
generous
without
risk
so
be
it
triple
fool
that
i
was
to
have
hoped
for
a
moment
during
this
time
charles
took
the
hand
of
athos
comte
said
he
you
have
been
to
me
a
second
father
the
services
you
have
rendered
to
me
are
above
all
price
i
have
nevertheless
thought
of
a
recompense
you
were
created
by
my
father
a
knight
of
the
garter
that
is
an
order
which
all
the
kings
of
europe
can
not
bear
by
the
queen
regent
knight
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
an
order
not
less
illustrious
i
join
to
it
that
of
the
golden
fleece
sent
me
by
the
king
of
france
to
whom
the
king
of
spain
his
gave
two
on
the
occasion
of
his
marriage
but
in
return
i
have
a
service
to
ask
of
you
sire
said
athos
with
confusion
the
golden
fleece
for
me
when
the
king
of
france
is
the
only
person
in
my
country
who
enjoys
that
distinction
i
wish
you
to
be
in
your
country
and
all
others
the
equal
of
all
those
whom
sovereigns
have
honored
with
their
favor
said
charles
drawing
the
chain
from
his
neck
and
i
am
sure
comte
my
father
smiles
on
me
from
his
grave
it
is
unaccountably
strange
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
whilst
his
friend
on
his
knees
received
the
eminent
order
which
the
king
conferred
on
him
it
is
almost
incredible
that
i
have
always
seen
showers
of
prosperity
fall
upon
all
who
surrounded
me
and
that
not
a
drop
ever
reached
me
if
i
were
a
jealous
man
it
would
be
enough
to
make
one
tear
one
s
hair
parole
d
honneur
athos
rose
from
his
knees
and
charles
embraced
him
tenderly
general
said
he
to
monk
then
stopping
with
a
smile
pardon
me
duke
i
mean
no
wonder
if
i
make
a
mistake
the
word
duke
is
too
short
for
me
i
always
seek
some
title
to
lengthen
it
i
should
wish
to
see
you
so
near
my
throne
that
i
might
say
to
you
as
to
louis
my
brother
oh
i
have
it
and
you
will
almost
be
my
brother
for
i
make
you
viceroy
of
ireland
and
scotland
my
dear
duke
so
after
that
fashion
henceforward
i
shall
not
make
a
mistake
the
duke
seized
the
hand
of
the
king
but
without
enthusiasm
without
joy
as
he
did
everything
his
heart
however
had
been
moved
by
this
last
favor
charles
by
skillfully
husbanding
his
generosity
had
given
the
duke
time
to
wish
although
he
might
not
have
wished
for
so
much
as
was
given
him
mordioux
grumbled
d
artagnan
there
is
the
shower
beginning
again
oh
it
is
enough
to
turn
one
s
brain
and
he
turned
away
with
an
air
so
sorrowful
and
so
comically
piteous
that
the
king
who
caught
it
could
not
restrain
a
smile
monk
was
preparing
to
leave
the
room
to
take
leave
of
charles
what
my
trusty
and
said
the
king
to
the
duke
are
you
going
with
your
majesty
s
permission
for
in
truth
i
am
weary
the
emotions
of
the
day
have
worn
me
out
i
stand
in
need
of
rest
but
said
the
king
you
are
not
going
without
d
artagnan
i
hope
why
not
sire
said
the
old
warrior
well
you
know
very
well
why
said
the
king
monk
looked
at
charles
with
astonishment
oh
it
may
be
possible
but
if
you
forget
you
d
artagnan
do
not
astonishment
was
painted
on
the
face
of
the
musketeer
well
then
duke
said
the
king
do
you
not
lodge
with
m
d
artagnan
i
had
the
honor
of
offering
d
artagnan
a
lodging
yes
sire
that
idea
is
your
own
and
yours
solely
mine
and
mine
only
yes
sire
well
but
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
prisoner
always
lodges
with
his
conqueror
monk
colored
in
his
turn
ah
that
is
true
said
he
i
am
d
artagnan
s
prisoner
without
doubt
duke
since
you
are
not
yet
ransomed
but
have
no
care
of
that
it
was
i
who
took
you
out
of
d
artagnan
s
hands
and
it
is
i
who
will
pay
your
ransom
the
eyes
of
d
artagnan
regained
their
gayety
and
their
brilliancy
the
gascon
began
to
understand
charles
advanced
towards
him
the
general
said
he
is
not
rich
and
can
not
pay
you
what
he
is
worth
i
am
richer
certainly
but
now
that
he
is
a
duke
and
if
not
a
king
almost
a
king
he
is
worth
a
sum
i
could
not
perhaps
pay
come
d
artagnan
be
moderate
with
me
how
much
do
i
owe
you
d
artagnan
delighted
at
the
turn
things
were
taking
but
not
for
a
moment
losing
his
replied
sire
your
majesty
has
no
occasion
to
be
alarmed
when
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
take
his
grace
monk
was
only
a
general
it
is
therefore
only
a
general
s
ransom
that
is
due
to
me
but
if
the
general
will
have
the
kindness
to
deliver
me
his
sword
i
shall
consider
myself
paid
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
general
s
sword
which
is
worth
as
much
as
himself
odds
fish
as
my
father
said
cried
charles
that
is
a
gallant
proposal
and
a
gallant
man
is
he
not
duke
upon
my
honor
yes
sire
and
he
drew
his
sword
monsieur
said
he
to
d
artagnan
here
is
what
you
demand
many
have
handled
a
better
blade
but
however
modest
mine
may
be
i
have
never
surrendered
it
to
any
one
d
artagnan
received
with
pride
the
sword
which
had
just
made
a
king
oh
oh
cried
charles
ii
what
a
sword
that
has
restored
me
to
my
throne
to
go
out
of
the
kingdom
and
not
one
day
to
figure
among
the
crown
jewels
no
on
my
soul
that
shall
not
be
captain
d
artagnan
i
will
give
you
two
hundred
thousand
livres
for
your
sword
if
that
is
too
little
say
so
it
is
too
little
sire
replied
d
artagnan
with
inimitable
seriousness
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
at
all
wish
to
sell
it
but
your
majesty
desires
me
to
do
so
and
that
is
an
order
i
obey
then
but
the
respect
i
owe
to
the
illustrious
warrior
who
hears
me
commands
me
to
estimate
a
third
more
the
reward
of
my
victory
i
ask
then
three
hundred
thousand
livres
for
the
sword
or
i
shall
give
it
to
your
majesty
for
nothing
and
taking
it
by
the
point
he
presented
it
to
the
king
charles
broke
into
hilarious
laughter
a
gallant
man
and
a
merry
companion
odds
fish
is
he
not
duke
is
he
not
comte
he
pleases
me
i
like
him
here
chevalier
d
artagnan
take
this
and
going
to
the
table
he
took
a
pen
and
wrote
an
order
upon
his
treasurer
for
three
hundred
thousand
livres
d
artagnan
took
it
and
turning
gravely
towards
monk
i
have
still
asked
too
little
i
know
said
he
but
believe
me
your
grace
i
would
rather
have
died
that
allow
myself
to
be
governed
by
avarice
the
king
began
to
laugh
again
like
the
happiest
cockney
of
his
kingdom
you
will
come
and
see
me
again
before
you
go
chevalier
said
he
i
shall
want
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
gayety
now
my
frenchmen
are
leaving
me
ah
sire
it
will
not
be
with
the
gayety
as
with
the
duke
s
sword
i
will
give
it
to
your
majesty
gratis
replied
d
artagnan
whose
feet
scarcely
seemed
to
touch
the
ground
and
you
comte
added
charles
turning
towards
athos
come
again
also
i
have
an
important
message
to
confide
to
you
your
hand
duke
monk
pressed
the
hand
of
the
king
adieu
gentlemen
said
charles
holding
out
each
of
his
hands
to
the
two
frenchmen
who
carried
them
to
their
lips
well
said
athos
when
they
were
out
of
the
palace
are
you
satisfied
hush
said
d
artagnan
wild
with
joy
i
have
not
yet
returned
from
the
treasurer
s
a
shutter
may
fall
upon
my
head
chapter
xxxiv
of
the
embarrassment
of
riches
d
artagnan
lost
no
time
and
as
soon
as
the
thing
was
suitable
and
opportune
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
lord
treasurer
of
his
majesty
he
had
then
the
satisfaction
to
exchange
a
piece
of
paper
covered
with
very
ugly
writing
for
a
prodigious
number
of
crowns
recently
stamped
with
the
effigies
of
his
very
gracious
majesty
charles
ii
d
artagnan
easily
controlled
himself
and
yet
on
this
occasion
he
could
not
help
evincing
a
joy
which
the
reader
will
perhaps
comprehend
if
he
deigns
to
have
some
indulgence
for
a
man
who
since
his
birth
had
never
seen
so
many
pieces
and
rolls
of
pieces
in
an
order
truly
agreeable
to
the
eye
the
treasurer
placed
all
the
rolls
in
bags
and
closed
each
bag
with
a
stamp
sealed
with
the
arms
of
england
a
favor
which
treasurers
do
not
grant
to
everybody
then
impassible
and
just
as
polite
as
he
ought
to
be
towards
a
man
honored
with
the
friendship
of
the
king
he
said
to
d
artagnan
take
away
your
money
sir
your
money
these
words
made
a
thousand
chords
vibrate
in
the
heart
of
d
artagnan
which
he
had
never
felt
before
he
had
the
bags
packed
in
a
small
cart
and
returned
home
meditating
deeply
a
man
who
possessed
three
hundred
thousand
livres
can
no
longer
expect
to
wear
a
smooth
brow
a
wrinkle
for
every
hundred
thousand
livres
is
not
too
much
d
artagnan
shut
himself
up
ate
no
dinner
closed
his
door
to
everybody
and
with
a
lighted
lamp
and
a
loaded
pistol
on
the
table
he
watched
all
night
ruminating
upon
the
means
of
preventing
these
lovely
crowns
which
from
the
coffers
of
the
king
had
passed
into
his
coffers
from
passing
from
his
coffers
into
the
pockets
of
any
thief
whatever
the
best
means
discovered
by
the
gascon
was
to
inclose
his
treasure
for
the
present
under
locks
so
solid
that
no
wrist
could
break
them
and
so
complicated
that
no
could
open
them
d
artagnan
remembered
that
the
english
are
masters
in
mechanics
and
conservative
industry
and
he
determined
to
go
in
the
morning
in
search
of
a
mechanic
who
would
sell
him
a
strong
box
he
did
not
go
far
master
will
jobson
dwelling
in
piccadilly
listened
to
his
propositions
comprehended
his
wishes
and
promised
to
make
him
a
safety
lock
that
should
relieve
him
from
all
future
fear
i
will
give
you
said
he
a
piece
of
mechanism
entirely
new
at
the
first
serious
attempt
upon
your
lock
an
invisible
plate
will
open
of
itself
and
vomit
forth
a
pretty
copper
bullet
the
weight
of
a
mark
which
will
knock
down
the
intruder
and
not
with
a
loud
report
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
it
very
ingenuous
cried
d
artagnan
the
little
copper
bullet
pleases
me
mightily
so
now
sir
mechanic
the
terms
a
fortnight
for
the
execution
and
fifteen
hundred
livres
payable
on
delivery
replied
the
artisan
d
artagnan
s
brow
darkened
a
fortnight
was
delay
enough
to
allow
the
thieves
of
london
time
to
remove
all
occasion
for
the
strong
box
as
to
the
fifteen
hundred
livres
that
would
be
paying
too
dear
for
what
a
little
vigilance
would
procure
him
for
nothing
i
will
think
of
it
said
he
thank
you
sir
and
he
returned
home
at
full
speed
nobody
had
yet
touched
his
treasure
that
same
day
athos
paid
a
visit
to
his
friend
and
found
him
so
thoughtful
that
he
could
not
help
expressing
his
surprise
how
is
this
said
he
you
are
rich
and
not
gay
you
who
were
so
anxious
for
wealth
my
friend
the
pleasures
to
which
we
are
not
accustomed
oppress
us
more
than
the
griefs
with
which
we
are
familiar
give
me
your
opinion
if
you
please
i
can
ask
you
who
have
always
had
money
when
we
have
money
what
do
we
do
with
it
that
depends
what
have
you
done
with
yours
seeing
that
it
has
not
made
you
a
miser
or
a
prodigal
for
avarice
dries
up
the
heart
and
prodigality
drowns
it
is
that
not
so
fabricius
could
not
have
spoken
more
justly
but
in
truth
my
money
has
never
been
a
burden
to
me
how
so
do
you
place
it
out
at
interest
no
you
know
i
have
a
tolerably
handsome
house
and
that
house
composes
the
better
part
of
my
property
i
know
it
does
so
that
you
can
be
as
rich
as
i
am
and
indeed
more
rich
whenever
you
like
by
the
same
means
but
your
rents
do
you
lay
them
by
no
what
do
you
think
of
a
chest
concealed
in
a
wall
i
never
made
use
of
such
a
thing
then
you
must
have
some
confidant
some
safe
man
of
business
who
pays
you
interest
at
a
fair
rate
not
at
all
good
heavens
what
do
you
do
with
it
then
i
spend
all
i
have
and
i
only
have
what
i
spend
my
dear
d
artagnan
ah
that
may
be
but
you
are
something
of
a
prince
fifteen
or
sixteen
thousand
livres
melt
away
between
your
fingers
and
then
you
have
expenses
and
appearances
well
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
be
less
of
a
noble
than
i
am
my
friend
your
money
would
be
quite
sufficient
three
hundred
thousand
livres
too
much
i
beg
your
pardon
did
you
not
tell
me
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
i
fancied
you
had
a
partner
ah
mordioux
that
s
true
cried
d
artagnan
coloring
there
is
planchet
i
had
forgotten
planchet
upon
my
life
well
there
are
my
three
hundred
thousand
livres
broken
into
that
s
a
pity
it
was
a
round
sum
and
sounded
well
that
is
true
athos
i
am
no
longer
rich
what
a
memory
you
have
tolerably
good
yes
thank
god
the
worthy
planchet
grumbled
d
artagnan
his
was
not
a
bad
dream
what
a
speculation
peste
well
what
is
said
is
said
how
much
are
you
to
give
him
oh
said
d
artagnan
he

have
no
fear
for
the
worthy
planchet

my
respects

you

grimaud
with
all
my
heart

simple
and
which

not

i
shall
only
beg
him
to
take
charge
of
my
pistols
which
lie
there
on
the
table
near
that
coffer
very
well
replied
athos
imperturbably
and
he
will
not
stir
will
he
not
more
than
the
pistols
themselves
then
i
shall
go
and
take
leave
of
his
majesty
au
revoir
d
artagnan
arrived
at
james
s
where
charles
who
was
busy
writing
kept
him
in
the
a
full
hour
whilst
walking
about
in
the
gallery
from
the
door
to
the
window
from
the
window
to
the
door
he
thought
he
saw
a
cloak
like
athos
s
cross
the
vestibule
but
at
the
moment
he
was
going
to
ascertain
if
it
were
he
the
usher
summoned
him
to
his
majesty
s
presence
charles
ii
rubbed
his
hands
while
receiving
the
thanks
of
our
friend
chevalier
said
he
you
are
wrong
to
express
gratitude
to
me
i
have
not
paid
you
a
quarter
of
the
value
of
the
history
of
the
box
into
which
you
put
the
brave
general
the
excellent
duke
of
albemarle
i
mean
and
the
king
laughed
heartily
d
artagnan
did
not
think
it
proper
to
interrupt
his
majesty
and
he
bowed
with
much
modesty
a
propos
continued
charles
do
you
think
my
dear
monk
has
really
pardoned
you
pardoned
me
yes
i
hope
so
sire
eh
but
it
was
a
cruel
trick
odds
fish
to
pack
up
the
first
personage
of
the
english
revolution
like
a
herring
in
your
place
i
would
not
trust
him
chevalier
but
sire
yes
i
know
very
well
monk
calls
you
his
friend
but
he
has
too
penetrating
an
eye
not
to
have
a
memory
and
too
lofty
a
brow
not
to
be
very
proud
you
know
grande
supercilium
i
shall
certainly
learn
latin
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
but
stop
cried
the
merry
monarch
i
must
manage
your
reconciliation
i
know
how
to
set
about
it
so
d
artagnan
bit
his
mustache
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
speak
chevalier
speak
well
sire
you
alarm
me
greatly
if
your
majesty
undertakes
the
affair
as
you
seem
inclined
to
do
i
am
a
lost
man
the
duke
will
have
me
assassinated
the
king
burst
into
a
fresh
roar
of
laughter
which
changed
d
artagnan
s
alarm
into
downright
terror
sire
i
beg
you
to
allow
me
to
settle
this
matter
myself
and
if
your
majesty
has
no
further
need
of
my
services
no
chevalier
what
do
you
want
to
leave
us
replied
charles
with
a
hilarity
that
grew
more
and
more
alarming
if
your
majesty
has
no
more
commands
for
me
charles
became
more
serious
one
single
thing
see
my
sister
the
lady
henrietta
do
you
know
her
no
sire
but
an
old
soldier
like
me
is
not
an
agreeable
spectacle
for
a
young
and
gay
princess
ah
but
my
sister
must
know
you
she
must
in
case
of
need
have
you
to
depend
upon
sire
every
one
that
is
dear
to
your
majesty
will
be
sacred
to
me
very
well
parry
come
here
parry
the
side
door
opened
and
parry
entered
his
face
beaming
with
pleasure
as
soon
as
he
saw
d
artagnan
what
is
rochester
doing
said
the
king
he
is
on
the
canal
with
the
ladies
replied
parry
and
buckingham
he
is
there
also
that
is
well
you
will
conduct
the
chevalier
to
villiers
that
is
the
duke
of
buckingham
chevalier
and
beg
the
duke
to
introduce
d
artagnan
to
the
princess
henrietta
parry
bowed
and
smiled
to
d
artagnan
chevalier
continued
the
king
this
is
your
parting
audience
you
can
afterwards
set
out
as
soon
as
you
please
sire
i
thank
you
but
be
sure
you
make
your
peace
with
monk
oh
sire
you
know
there
is
one
of
my
vessels
at
your
disposal
sire
you
overpower
me
i
can
not
think
of
putting
your
majesty
s
officers
to
inconvenience
on
my
account
the
king
slapped
d
artagnan
upon
the
shoulder
nobody
will
be
inconvenienced
on
your
account
chevalier
but
for
that
of
an
ambassador
i
am
about
sending
to
france
and
to
whom
you
will
willingly
serve
as
a
companion
i
fancy
for
you
know
him
d
artagnan
appeared
astonished
he
is
a
certain
comte
de
la
fere
whom
you
call
athos
added
the
king
terminating
the
conversation
as
he
had
begun
it
by
a
joyous
burst
of
laughter
adieu
chevalier
adieu
love
me
as
i
love
you
and
thereupon
making
a
sign
to
parry
to
ask
if
there
were
any
one
waiting
for
him
in
the
adjoining
closet
the
king
disappeared
into
that
closet
leaving
the
chevalier
perfectly
astonished
by
this
singular
audience
the
old
man
took
his
arm
in
a
friendly
way
and
led
him
towards
the
garden
chapter
xxxv
on
the
canal
upon
the
green
waters
of
the
canal
bordered
with
marble
upon
which
time
had
already
scattered
black
spots
and
tufts
of
mossy
grass
there
glided
majestically
a
long
flat
bark
adorned
with
the
arms
of
england
surmounted
by
a
dais
and
carpeted
with
long
damasked
stuffs
which
trailed
their
fringes
in
the
water
eight
rowers
leaning
lazily
to
their
oars
made
it
move
upon
the
canal
with
the
graceful
slowness
of
the
swans
which
disturbed
in
their
ancient
possessions
by
the
approach
of
the
bark
looked
from
a
distance
at
this
splendid
and
noisy
pageant
we
say
noisy
for
the
bark
contained
four
guitar
and
lute
players
two
singers
and
several
courtiers
all
sparkling
with
gold
and
precious
stones
and
showing
their
white
teeth
in
emulation
of
each
other
to
please
the
lady
henrietta
stuart
of
henry
daughter
of
charles
and
sister
of
charles
who
occupied
the
seat
of
honor
under
the
dais
of
the
bark
we
know
this
young
princess
we
have
seen
her
at
the
louvre
with
her
mother
wanting
wood
wanting
bread
and
fed
by
the
coadjuteur
and
the
parliament
she
had
therefore
like
her
brothers
passed
through
an
uneasy
youth
then
all
at
once
she
had
just
awakened
from
a
long
and
horrible
dream
seated
on
the
steps
of
a
throne
surrounded
by
courtiers
and
flatterers
like
mary
stuart
on
leaving
prison
she
aspired
not
only
to
life
and
liberty
but
to
power
and
wealth
the
lady
henrietta
in
growing
had
attained
remarkable
beauty
which
the
recent
restoration
had
rendered
celebrated
misfortune
had
taken
from
her
the
luster
of
pride
but
prosperity
had
restored
it
to
her
she
was
resplendent
then
in
her
joy
and
her
happiness
like
those
flowers
which
forgotten
during
a
frosty
autumn
night
have
hung
their
heads
but
which
on
the
morrow
warmed
once
more
by
the
atmosphere
in
which
they
were
born
rise
again
with
greater
splendor
than
ever
villiers
duke
of
buckingham
son
of
him
who
played
so
conspicuous
a
part
in
the
early
chapters
of
this
history
villiers
of
buckingham
a
handsome
cavalier
melancholy
with
women
a
jester
with
men
and
wilmot
lord
rochester
a
jester
with
both
sexes
were
standing
at
this
moment
before
the
lady
henrietta
disputing
the
privilege
of
making
her
smile
as
to
that
young
and
beautiful
princess
reclining
upon
a
cushion
of
velvet
bordered
with
gold
her
hands
hanging
listlessly
so
as
to
dip
in
the
water
she
listened
carelessly
to
the
musicians
without
hearing
them
and
heard
the
two
courtiers
without
appearing
to
listen
to
them
this
lady
henrietta
this
charming
creature
this
woman
who
joined
the
graces
of
france
to
the
beauties
of
england
not
having
yet
loved
was
cruel
in
her
coquetry
the
smile
then
that
innocent
favor
of
young
girls
did
not
even
lighten
her
countenance
and
if
at
times
she
did
raise
her
eyes
it
was
to
fasten
them
upon
one
or
other
of
the
cavaliers
with
such
a
fixity
that
their
gallantry
bold
as
it
generally
was
took
the
alarm
and
became
timid
in
the
meanwhile
the
boat
continued
its
course
the
musicians
made
a
great
noise
and
the
courtiers
began
like
them
to
be
out
of
breath
besides
the
excursion
became
doubtless
monotonous
to
the
princess
for
all
at
once
shaking
her
head
with
an
air
of
impatience
come
gentlemen
enough
of
this
let
us
land
ah
madam
said
buckingham
we
are
very
unfortunate
we
have
not
succeeded
in
making
the
excursion
agreeable
to
your
royal
highness
my
mother
expects
me
replied
the
princess
and
i
must
frankly
admit
gentlemen
i
am
bored
and
whilst
uttering
this
cruel
word
henrietta
endeavored
to
console
by
a
look
each
of
the
two
young
men
who
appeared
terrified
at
such
frankness
the
look
produced
its
effect
the
two
faces
brightened
but
immediately
as
if
the
royal
coquette
thought
she
had
done
too
much
for
simple
mortals
she
made
a
movement
turned
her
back
on
both
her
adorers
and
appeared
plunged
in
a
reverie
in
which
it
was
evident
they
had
no
part
buckingham
bit
his
lips
with
anger
for
he
was
truly
in
love
with
the
lady
henrietta
and
in
that
case
took
everything
in
a
serious
light
rochester
bit
his
lips
likewise
but
his
wit
always
dominated
over
his
heart
it
was
purely
and
simply
to
repress
a
malicious
smile
the
princess
was
then
allowing
the
eyes
she
turned
from
the
young
nobles
to
wander
over
the
green
and
flowery
turf
of
the
park
when
she
perceived
parry
and
d
artagnan
at
a
distance
who
is
coming
yonder
said
she
the
two
young
men
turned
round
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
parry
replied
buckingham
nobody
but
parry
i
beg
your
pardon
said
rochester
but
i
think
he
has
a
companion
yes
said
the
princess
at
first
with
languor
but
then
what
mean
those
words
nobody
but
parry
say
my
lord
because
madam
replied
buckingham
piqued
because
the
faithful
parry
the
wandering
parry
the
eternal
parry
is
not
i
believe
of
much
consequence
you
are
mistaken
duke
parry
the
wandering
parry
as
you
call
him
has
always
wandered
in
the
service
of
my
family
and
the
sight
of
that
old
man
always
gives
me
satisfaction
the
lady
henrietta
followed
the
usual
progress
of
pretty
women
particularly
coquettish
women
she
passed
from
caprice
to
contradiction
the
gallant
had
undergone
the
caprice
the
courtier
must
bend
beneath
the
contradictory
humor
buckingham
bowed
but
made
no
reply
it
is
true
madam
said
rochester
bowing
in
his
turn
that
parry
is
the
model
of
servants
but
madam
he
is
no
longer
young
and
we
laugh
only
when
we
see
cheerful
objects
is
an
old
man
a
gay
object
enough
my
lord
said
the
princess
coolly
the
subject
of
conversation
is
unpleasant
to
me
then
as
if
speaking
to
herself
it
is
really
unaccountable
said
she
how
little
regard
my
brother
s
friends
have
for
his
servants
ah
madam
cried
buckingham
your
royal
highness
pierces
my
heart
with
a
dagger
forged
by
your
own
hands
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
speech
which
is
turned
so
like
a
french
madrigal
duke
i
do
not
understand
it
it
means
madam
that
you
yourself
so
good
so
charming
so
sensible
you
have
laughed
sometimes
smiled
i
should
say
at
the
idle
prattle
of
that
good
parry
for
whom
your
royal
highness
entertains
such
a
marvelous
susceptibility
well
my
lord
if
i
have
forgotten
myself
so
far
said
henrietta
you
do
wrong
to
remind
me
of
it
and
she
made
a
sign
of
impatience
the
good
parry
wants
to
speak
to
me
i
believe
please
order
them
to
row
to
the
shore
my
lord
rochester
rochester
hastened
to
repeat
the
princess
s
command
and
a
moment
later
the
boat
touched
the
bank
let
us
land
gentlemen
said
henrietta
taking
the
arm
which
rochester
offered
her
although
buckingham
was
nearer
to
her
and
had
presented
his
then
rochester
with
an
pride
which
pierced
the
heart
of
the
unhappy
buckingham
through
and
through
led
the
princess
across
the
little
bridge
which
the
rowers
had
cast
from
the
royal
boat
to
the
shore
which
way
will
your
highness
go
asked
rochester
you
see
my
lord
towards
that
good
parry
who
is
wandering
as
my
lord
of
buckingham
says
and
seeking
me
with
eyes
weakened
by
the
tears
he
has
shed
over
our
misfortunes
good
heavens
said
rochester
how
sad
your
royal
highness
is
in
truth
we
seem
ridiculous
fools
to
you
madam
speak
for
yourself
my
lord
interrupted
buckingham
with
vexation
for
my
part
i
displease
her
royal
highness
to
such
a
degree
that
i
appear
absolutely
nothing
to
her
neither
rochester
nor
the
princess
made
any
reply
henrietta
only
urged
her
companion
more
quickly
on
buckingham
remained
behind
and
took
advantage
of
this
isolation
to
give
himself
up
to
his
anger
he
bit
his
handkerchief
so
furiously
that
it
was
soon
in
shreds
parry
my
good
parry
said
the
princess
with
her
gentle
voice
come
hither
i
see
you
are
seeking
me
and
i
am
waiting
for
you
ah
madam
said
rochester
coming
charitably
to
the
help
of
his
companion
who
had
remained
as
we
have
said
behind
if
parry
can
not
see
your
royal
highness
the
man
who
follows
him
is
a
sufficient
guide
even
for
a
blind
man
for
he
has
eyes
of
flame
that
man
is
a
lantern
lighting
a
very
handsome
martial
countenance
said
the
princess
determined
to
be
as
as
possible
rochester
bowed
one
of
those
vigorous
soldiers
heads
seen
nowhere
but
in
france
added
the
princess
with
the
perseverance
of
a
woman
sure
of
impunity
rochester
and
buckingham
looked
at
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
what
can
be
the
matter
with
her
see
my
lord
of
buckingham
what
parry
wants
said
henrietta
go
the
young
man
who
considered
this
order
as
a
favor
resumed
his
courage
and
hastened
to
meet
parry
who
followed
by
d
artagnan
advanced
slowly
on
account
of
his
age
d
artagnan
walked
slowly
but
nobly
as
d
artagnan
doubled
by
the
third
of
a
million
ought
to
walk
that
is
to
say
without
conceit
or
swagger
but
without
timidity
when
buckingham
very
eager
to
comply
with
the
desire
of
the
princess
who
had
seated
herself
on
a
marble
bench
as
if
fatigued
with
the
few
steps
she
had
gone
when
buckingham
we
say
was
at
a
distance
of
only
a
few
paces
from
parry
the
latter
recognized
him
ah
my
lord
cried
he
quite
out
of
breath
will
your
grace
obey
the
king
in
what
mr
parry
said
the
young
man
with
a
kind
of
coolness
tempered
by
a
desire
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
princess
well
his
majesty
begs
your
grace
to
present
this
gentleman
to
her
royal
highness
the
princess
henrietta
in
the
first
place
what
is
the
gentleman
s
name
said
the
duke
haughtily
d
artagnan
as
we
know
was
easily
affronted
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
s
tone
displeased
him
he
surveyed
the
courtier
from
head
to
foot
and
two
flashes
beamed
from
beneath
his
bent
brows
but
after
a
struggle
monsieur
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
my
lord
replied
he
quietly
pardon
me
sir
that
teaches
me
your
name
but
nothing
more
you
mean
i
mean
i
do
not
know
you
i
am
more
fortunate
than
you
sir
replied
d
artagnan
for
i
have
had
the
honor
of
knowing
your
family
and
particularly
my
lord
duke
of
buckingham
your
illustrious
father
my
father
said
buckingham
well
i
think
i
now
remember
monsieur
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
do
you
say
d
artagnan
bowed
in
person
said
he
pardon
me
but
are
you
one
of
those
frenchmen
who
had
secret
relations
with
my
father
exactly
my
lord
duke
i
am
one
of
those
frenchmen
then
sir
permit
me
to
say
that
it
was
strange
my
father
never
heard
of
you
during
his
lifetime
no
monsieur
but
he
heard
of
me
at
the
moment
of
his
death
it
was
i
who
sent
to
him
through
the
hands
of
the
valet
de
chambre
of
anne
of
austria
notice
of
the
dangers
which
threatened
him
unfortunately
it
came
too
late
never
mind
monsieur
said
buckingham
i
understand
now
that
having
had
the
intention
of
rendering
a
service
to
the
father
you
have
come
to
claim
the
protection
of
the
son
in
the
first
place
my
lord
replied
d
artagnan
phlegmatically
i
claim
the
protection
of
no
man
his
majesty
charles
to
whom
i
have
had
the
honor
of
rendering
some
services
i
may
tell
you
my
lord
my
life
has
been
passed
in
such
occupations
king
charles
then
who
wishes
to
honor
me
with
some
kindness
desires
me
to
be
presented
to
her
royal
highness
the
princess
henrietta
his
sister
to
whom
i
shall
perhaps
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
of
service
hereafter
now
the
king
knew
that
you
at
this
moment
were
with
her
royal
highness
and
sent
me
to
you
there
is
no
other
mystery
i
ask
absolutely
nothing
of
you
and
if
you
will
not
present
me
to
her
royal
highness
i
shall
be
compelled
to
do
without
you
and
present
myself
at
least
sir
said
buckingham
determined
to
have
the
last
word
you
will
not
refuse
me
an
explanation
provoked
by
yourself
i
never
refuse
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
as
you
have
had
relations
with
my
father
you
must
be
acquainted
with
some
private
details
these
relations
are
already
far
removed
from
us
my
lord
for
you
were
not
then
born
and
for
some
unfortunate
diamond
studs
which
i
received
from
his
hands
and
carried
back
to
france
it
is
really
not
worth
while
awakening
so
many
remembrances
ah
sir
said
buckingham
warmly
going
up
to
d
artagnan
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
him
it
is
you
then
you
whom
my
father
sought
everywhere
and
who
had
a
right
to
expect
so
much
from
us
to
expect
my
lord
in
truth
that
is
my
forte
all
my
life
i
have
expected
at
this
moment
the
princess
who
was
tired
of
not
seeing
the
stranger
approach
her
arose
and
came
towards
them
at
least
sir
said
buckingham
you
shall
not
wait
for
the
presentation
you
claim
of
me
then
turning
towards
the
princess
and
bowing
madam
said
the
young
man
the
king
your
brother
desires
me
to
have
the
honor
of
presenting
to
your
royal
highness
monsieur
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
in
order
that
your
royal
highness
may
have
in
case
of
need
a
firm
support
and
a
sure
friend
added
parry
d
artagnan
bowed
you
have
still
something
to
say
parry
replied
henrietta
smiling
upon
d
artagnan
while
addressing
the
old
servant
yes
madam
the
king
desires
you
to
preserve
religiously
in
your
memory
the
name
and
merit
of
d
artagnan
to
whom
his
majesty
owes
he
says
the
recovery
of
his
kingdom
buckingham
the
princess
and
rochester
looked
at
each
other
that
said
d
artagnan
is
another
little
secret
of
which
in
all
probability
i
shall
not
boast
to
his
majesty
s
son
as
i
have
done
to
you
with
respect
to
the
diamond
studs
madam
said
buckingham
monsieur
has
just
for
the
second
time
recalled
to
my
memory
an
event
which
excites
my
curiosity
to
such
a
degree
that
i
shall
venture
to
ask
your
permission
to
take
him
to
one
side
for
a
moment
to
converse
in
private
do
my
lord
said
the
princess
but
restore
to
the
sister
as
quickly
as
possible
this
friend
so
devoted
to
the
brother
and
she
took
the
arm
of
rochester
whilst
buckingham
took
that
of
d
artagnan
oh
tell
me
chevalier
said
buckingham
all
that
affair
of
the
diamonds
which
nobody
knows
in
england
not
even
the
son
of
him
who
was
the
hero
of
it
my
lord
one
person
alone
had
a
right
to
relate
all
that
affair
as
you
call
it
and
that
was
your
father
he
thought
it
proper
to
be
silent
i
must
beg
you
to
allow
me
to
be
so
likewise
and
d
artagnan
bowed
like
a
man
upon
whom
it
was
evident
no
entreaties
could
prevail
since
it
is
so
sir
said
buckingham
pardon
my
indiscretion
i
beg
you
and
if
at
any
time
i
should
go
into
france
and
he
turned
round
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
princess
who
took
but
little
notice
of
him
totally
occupied
as
she
was
or
appeared
to
be
with
rochester
buckingham
sighed
well
said
d
artagnan
i
was
saying
that
if
any
day
i
were
to
go
to
france
you
will
go
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
i
shall
answer
for
that
and
how
so
oh
i
have
strange
powers
of
prediction
if
i
do
predict
anything
i
am
seldom
mistaken
if
then
you
do
come
to
france
well
then
monsieur
you
of
whom
kings
ask
that
valuable
friendship
which
restores
crowns
to
them
i
will
venture
to
beg
of
you
a
little
of
that
great
interest
you
took
in
my
father
my
lord
replied
d
artagnan
believe
me
i
shall
deem
myself
highly
honored
if
in
france
you
remember
having
seen
me
here
and
now
permit
then
turning
towards
the
princess
madam
said
he
your
royal
highness
is
a
daughter
of
france
and
in
that
quality
i
hope
to
see
you
again
in
paris
one
of
my
happy
days
will
be
on
that
on
which
your
royal
highness
shall
give
me
any
command
whatever
thus
proving
to
me
that
you
have
not
forgotten
the
recommendations
of
your
august
brother
and
he
bowed
respectfully
to
the
young
princess
who
gave
him
her
hand
to
kiss
with
a
right
royal
grace
ah
madam
said
buckingham
in
a
subdued
voice
what
can
a
man
do
to
obtain
a
similar
favor
from
your
royal
highness
dame
my
lord
replied
henrietta
ask
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
will
tell
you
chapter
xxxvi
how
d
artagnan
drew
a
from
a
deal
box
the
king
s
words
regarding
the
wounded
pride
of
monk
had
inspired
d
artagnan
with
no
small
portion
of
apprehension
the
lieutenant
had
had
all
his
life
the
great
art
of
choosing
his
enemies
and
when
he
had
found
them
implacable
and
invincible
it
was
when
he
had
not
been
able
under
any
pretense
to
make
them
otherwise
but
points
of
view
change
greatly
in
the
course
of
a
life
it
is
a
magic
lantern
of
which
the
eye
of
man
every
year
changes
the
aspects
it
results
that
from
the
last
day
of
a
year
on
which
we
saw
white
to
the
first
day
of
the
year
on
which
we
shall
see
black
there
is
the
interval
of
but
a
single
night
now
d
artagnan
when
he
left
calais
with
his
ten
scamps
would
have
hesitated
as
little
in
attacking
a
goliath
a
nebuchadnezzar
or
a
holofernes
as
he
would
in
crossing
swords
with
a
recruit
or
caviling
with
a
then
he
resembled
the
which
when
fasting
will
attack
a
ram
hunger
is
blind
but
d
artagnan
satisfied
d
artagnan
rich
d
artagnan
a
conqueror
d
artagnan
proud
of
so
difficult
a
triumph
d
artagnan
had
too
much
to
lose
not
to
reckon
figure
by
figure
with
probable
misfortune
his
thoughts
were
employed
therefore
all
the
way
on
the
road
from
his
presentation
with
one
thing
and
that
was
how
he
should
conciliate
a
man
like
monk
a
man
whom
charles
himself
king
as
he
was
conciliated
with
difficulty
for
scarcely
established
the
protected
might
again
stand
in
need
of
the
protector
and
would
consequently
not
refuse
him
such
being
the
case
the
petty
satisfaction
of
transporting
d
artagnan
or
of
confining
him
in
one
of
the
middlesex
prisons
or
drowning
him
a
little
on
his
passage
from
dover
to
boulogne
such
sorts
of
satisfaction
kings
are
accustomed
to
render
to
viceroys
without
disagreeable
consequences
it
would
not
be
at
all
necessary
for
the
king
to
be
active
in
that
contrepartie
of
the
play
in
which
monk
should
take
his
revenge
the
part
of
the
king
would
be
confined
to
simply
pardoning
the
viceroy
of
ireland
all
he
should
undertake
against
d
artagnan
nothing
more
was
necessary
to
place
the
conscience
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
at
rest
than
a
te
absolvo
said
with
a
laugh
or
the
scrawl
of
charles
the
king
traced
at
the
foot
of
a
parchment
and
with
these
two
words
pronounced
and
these
two
words
written
poor
d
artagnan
was
forever
crushed
beneath
the
ruins
of
his
imagination
and
then
a
thing
sufficiently
disquieting
for
a
man
with
such
foresight
as
our
musketeer
he
found
himself
alone
and
even
the
friendship
of
athos
could
not
restore
his
confidence
certainly
if
the
affair
had
only
concerned
a
free
distribution
of
the
musketeer
would
have
counted
upon
his
companion
but
in
delicate
dealings
with
a
king
when
the
perhaps
of
an
unlucky
chance
should
arise
in
justification
of
monk
or
of
charles
of
england
d
artagnan
knew
athos
well
enough
to
be
sure
he
would
give
the
best
possible
coloring
to
the
loyalty
of
the
survivor
and
would
content
himself
with
shedding
floods
of
tears
on
the
tomb
of
the
dead
supposing
the
dead
to
be
his
friend
and
afterwards
composing
his
epitaph
in
the
most
pompous
superlatives
decidedly
thought
the
gascon
and
this
thought
was
the
result
of
the
reflections
which
he
had
just
whispered
to
himself
and
which
we
have
repeated
aloud
decidedly
i
must
be
reconciled
with
monk
and
acquire
proof
of
his
perfect
indifference
for
the
past
if
and
god
forbid
it
should
be
so
he
is
still
sulky
and
reserved
in
the
expression
of
this
sentiment
i
shall
give
my
money
to
athos
to
take
away
with
him
and
remain
in
england
just
long
enough
to
unmask
him
then
as
i
have
a
quick
eye
and
a
light
foot
i
shall
notice
the
first
hostile
sign
to
decamp
or
conceal
myself
at
the
residence
of
my
lord
buckingham
who
seems
a
good
sort
of
devil
at
the
bottom
and
to
whom
in
return
for
his
hospitality
i
shall
relate
all
that
history
of
the
diamonds
which
can
now
compromise
nobody
but
an
old
queen
who
need
not
be
ashamed
after
being
the
wife
of
a
miserly
creature
like
mazarin
of
having
formerly
been
the
mistress
of
a
handsome
nobleman
like
buckingham
mordioux
that
is
the
thing
and
this
monk
shall
not
get
the
better
of
me
eh
and
besides
i
have
an
idea
we
know
that
in
general
d
artagnan
was
not
wanting
in
ideas
and
during
this
soliloquy
d
artagnan
buttoned
his
vest
up
to
the
chin
and
nothing
excited
his
imagination
like
this
preparation
for
a
combat
of
any
kind
called
accinction
by
the
romans
he
was
quite
heated
when
he
reached
the
mansion
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
he
was
introduced
to
the
viceroy
with
a
promptitude
which
proved
that
he
was
considered
as
one
of
the
household
monk
was
in
his
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
with
that
expression
of
frankness
which
the
gascon
knew
so
well
how
to
assume
my
lord
i
have
come
to
ask
your
grace
s
advice
monk
as
closely
buttoned
up
morally
as
his
antagonist
was
physically
replied
ask
my
friend
and
his
countenance
presented
an
expression
not
less
open
than
that
of
d
artagnan
my
lord
in
the
first
place
promise
me
secrecy
and
indulgence
i
promise
you
all
you
wish
what
is
the
matter
speak
it
is
my
lord
that
i
am
not
quite
pleased
with
the
king
indeed
and
on
what
account
my
dear
lieutenant
because
his
majesty
gives
way
sometimes
to
jests
very
compromising
for
his
servants
and
jesting
my
lord
is
a
weapon
that
seriously
wounds
men
of
the
sword
as
we
are
monk
did
all
in
his
power
not
to
betray
his
thought
but
d
artagnan
watched
him
with
too
close
attention
not
to
detect
an
almost
imperceptible
flush
upon
his
face
well
now
for
my
part
said
he
with
the
most
natural
air
possible
i
am
not
an
enemy
of
jesting
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
my
soldiers
will
tell
you
that
even
many
times
in
camp
i
listened
very
indifferently
and
with
a
certain
pleasure
to
the
satirical
songs
which
the
army
of
lambert
passed
into
mine
and
which
certainly
would
have
caused
the
ears
of
a
general
more
susceptible
than
i
am
to
tingle
oh
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
i
know
you
are
a
complete
man
i
know
you
have
been
for
a
long
time
placed
above
human
miseries
but
there
are
jests
and
jests
of
a
certain
kind
which
have
the
power
of
irritating
me
beyond
expression
may
i
inquire
what
kind
my
friend
such
as
are
directed
against
my
friends
or
against
people
i
respect
my
lord
monk
made
a
slight
movement
which
d
artagnan
perceived
eh
and
in
what
asked
monk
in
what
can
the
stroke
of
a
pin
which
scratches
another
tickle
your
skin
answer
me
that
my
lord
i
can
explain
it
to
you
in
a
single
sentence
it
concerns
you
monk
advanced
a
single
step
towards
d
artagnan
concerns
me
said
he
yes
and
this
is
what
i
can
not
explain
but
that
arises
perhaps
from
my
want
of
knowledge
of
his
character
how
can
the
king
have
the
heart
to
jest
about
a
man
who
has
rendered
him
so
many
and
such
great
services
how
can
one
understand
that
he
should
amuse
himself
in
setting
by
the
ears
a
lion
like
you
with
a
gnat
like
me
i
can
not
conceive
that
in
any
way
said
monk
but
so
it
is
the
king
who
owed
me
a
reward
might
have
rewarded
me
as
a
soldier
without
contriving
that
history
of
the
ransom
which
affects
you
my
lord
no
said
monk
laughing
it
does
not
affect
me
in
any
way
i
can
assure
you
not
as
regards
me
i
can
understand
you
know
me
my
lord
i
am
so
discreet
that
the
grave
would
appear
a
babbler
compared
to
me
but
do
you
understand
my
lord
no
replied
monk
with
persistent
obstinacy
if
another
knew
the
secret
which
i
know
what
secret
eh
my
lord
why
that
unfortunate
secret
of
newcastle
oh
the
million
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
no
my
lord
no
the
enterprise
made
upon
your
grace
s
person
it
was
well
played
chevalier
that
is
all
and
no
more
is
to
be
said
about
it
you
are
a
soldier
both
brave
and
cunning
which
proves
that
you
unite
the
qualities
of
fabius
and
hannibal
you
employed
your
means
force
and
cunning
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
against
that
i
ought
to
have
been
on
guard
ah
yes
i
know
my
lord
and
i
expected
nothing
less
from
your
partiality
so
that
if
it
were
only
the
abduction
in
itself
mordioux
that
would
be
nothing
but
there
are
what
the
circumstances
of
that
abduction
what
circumstances
oh
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
my
lord
no
curse
me
if
i
do
there
is
in
truth
it
is
difficult
to
speak
it
there
is
well
there
is
that
devil
of
a
box
monk
colored
visibly
well
i
have
forgotten
it
deal
box
continued
d
artagnan
with
holes
for
the
nose
and
mouth
in
truth
my
lord
all
the
rest
was
well
but
the
box
the
box
that
was
really
a
coarse
joke
monk
fidgeted
about
in
his
chair
and
notwithstanding
my
having
done
that
resumed
d
artagnan
i
a
soldier
of
fortune
it
was
quite
simple
because
by
the
side
of
that
action
a
little
inconsiderate
i
admit
which
i
committed
but
which
the
gravity
of
the
case
may
excuse
i
am
circumspect
and
reserved
oh
said
monk
believe
me
i
know
you
well
monsieur
d
artagnan
and
i
appreciate
you
d
artagnan
never
took
his
eyes
off
monk
studying
all
which
passed
in
the
mind
of
the
general
as
he
prosecuted
his
idea
but
it
does
not
concern
me
resumed
he
well
then
who
does
it
concern
said
monk
who
began
to
grow
a
little
impatient
it
relates
to
the
king
who
will
never
restrain
his
tongue
well
and
suppose
he
should
say
all
he
knows
said
monk
with
a
degree
of
hesitation
my
lord
replied
d
artagnan
do
not
dissemble
i
implore
you
with
a
man
who
speaks
so
frankly
as
i
do
you
have
a
right
to
feel
your
susceptibility
excited
however
benignant
it
may
be
what
the
devil
it
is
not
the
place
for
a
man
like
you
a
man
who
plays
with
crowns
and
scepters
as
a
bohemian
plays
with
his
balls
it
is
not
the
place
of
a
serious
man
i
said
to
be
shut
up
in
a
box
like
some
freak
of
natural
history
for
you
must
understand
it
would
make
all
your
enemies
ready
to
burst
with
laughter
and
you
are
so
great
so
noble
so
generous
that
you
must
have
many
enemies
this
secret
is
enough
to
set
half
the
human
race
laughing
if
you
were
represented
in
that
box
it
is
not
decent
to
have
the
second
personage
in
the
kingdom
laughed
at
monk
was
quite
out
of
countenance
at
the
idea
of
seeing
himself
represented
in
this
box
ridicule
as
d
artagnan
had
judiciously
foreseen
acted
upon
him
in
a
manner
which
neither
the
chances
of
war
the
aspirations
of
ambition
nor
the
fear
of
death
had
been
able
to
do
good
thought
the
gascon
he
is
frightened
i
am
safe
oh
as
to
the
king
said
monk
fear
nothing
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
the
king
will
not
jest
with
monk
i
assure
you
the
momentary
flash
of
his
eye
was
noticed
by
d
artagnan
monk
lowered
his
tone
immediately
the
king
continued
he
is
of
too
noble
a
nature
the
king
s
heart
is
too
high
to
allow
him
to
wish
ill
to
those
who
do
him
good
oh
certainly
cried
d
artagnan
i
am
entirely
of
your
grace
s
opinion
with
regard
to
his
heart
but
not
as
to
his
head
it
is
good
but
it
is
trifling
the
king
will
not
trifle
with
monk
be
assured
then
you
are
quite
at
ease
my
lord
on
that
side
at
least
yes
perfectly
oh
i
understand
you
you
are
at
ease
as
far
as
the
king
is
concerned
i
have
told
you
i
was
but
you
are
not
so
much
so
on
my
account
i
thought
i
had
told
you
that
i
had
faith
in
your
loyalty
and
discretion
no
doubt
no
doubt
but
you
must
remember
one
thing
what
is
that
that
i
was
not
alone
that
i
had
companions
and
what
companions
oh
yes
i
know
them
and
unfortunately
my
lord
they
know
you
too
well
well
they
are
yonder
at
boulogne
waiting
for
me
and
you
fear
yes
i
fear
that
in
my
absence
parbleu
if
i
were
near
them
i
could
answer
for
their
silence
was
i
not
right
in
saying
that
the
danger
if
there
was
any
danger
would
not
come
from
his
majesty
however
disposed
he
may
be
to
jest
but
from
your
companions
as
you
say
to
be
laughed
at
by
a
king
may
be
tolerable
but
by
the
and
scamps
of
the
army
damn
it
yes
i
understand
that
would
be
unbearable
that
is
why
my
lord
i
came
to
say
do
you
not
think
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
set
out
for
france
as
soon
as
possible
certainly
if
you
think
your
presence
would
impose
silence
upon
those
scoundrels
oh
i
am
sure
of
that
my
lord
your
presence
will
not
prevent
the
report
from
spreading
if
the
tale
has
already
transpired
oh
it
has
not
transpired
my
lord
i
will
wager
at
all
events
be
assured
that
i
am
determined
upon
one
thing
what
is
that
to
blow
out
the
brains
of
the
first
who
shall
have
propagated
that
report
and
of
the
first
who
has
heard
it
after
which
i
shall
return
to
england
to
seek
an
asylum
and
perhaps
employment
with
your
grace
oh
come
back
come
back
unfortunately
my
lord
i
am
acquainted
with
nobody
here
but
your
grace
and
if
i
should
no
longer
find
you
or
if
you
should
have
forgotten
me
in
your
greatness
listen
to
me
monsieur
d
artagnan
replied
monk
you
are
a
superior
man
full
of
intelligence
and
courage
you
deserve
all
the
good
fortune
this
world
can
bring
you
come
with
me
into
scotland
and
i
swear
to
you
i
shall
arrange
for
you
a
fate
which
all
may
envy
oh
my
lord
that
is
impossible
at
present
i
have
a
sacred
duty
to
perform
i
have
to
watch
over
your
glory
i
have
to
prevent
a
low
jester
from
tarnishing
in
the
eyes
of
our
contemporaries
who
knows
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
the
splendor
of
your
name
of
posterity
monsieur
d
artagnan
doubtless
it
is
necessary
as
regards
posterity
that
all
the
details
of
that
history
should
remain
a
mystery
for
admit
that
this
unfortunate
history
of
the
deal
box
should
spread
and
it
should
be
asserted
that
you
had
not
the
king
loyally
and
of
your
own
free
will
but
in
consequence
of
a
compromise
entered
into
at
scheveningen
between
you
two
it
would
be
vain
for
me
to
declare
how
the
thing
came
about
for
though
i
know
i
should
not
be
believed
it
would
be
said
that
i
had
received
my
part
of
the
cake
and
was
eating
it
monk
knitted
his
glory
honor
probity
said
he
you
are
but
empty
words
mist
replied
d
artagnan
nothing
but
mist
through
which
nobody
can
see
clearly
well
then
go
to
france
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
monk
go
and
to
render
england
more
attractive
and
agreeable
to
you
accept
a
remembrance
of
me
what
now
thought
d
artagnan
i
have
on
the
banks
of
the
clyde
continued
monk
a
little
house
in
a
grove
cottage
as
it
is
called
here
to
this
house
are
attached
a
hundred
acres
of
land
accept
it
as
a
souvenir
oh
my
lord
faith
you
will
be
there
in
your
own
home
and
that
will
be
the
place
of
refuge
you
spoke
of
just
now
for
me
to
be
obliged
to
your
lordship
to
such
an
extent
really
your
grace
i
am
ashamed
not
at
all
not
at
all
monsieur
replied
monk
with
an
arch
smile
it
is
i
who
shall
be
obliged
to
you
and
pressing
the
hand
of
the
musketeer
i
shall
go
and
draw
up
the
deed
of
gift
and
he
left
the
room
d
artagnan
looked
at
him
as
he
went
out
with
something
of
a
pensive
and
even
an
agitated
air
after
all
said
he
he
is
a
brave
man
it
is
only
a
sad
reflection
that
it
is
from
fear
of
me
and
not
affection
that
he
acts
thus
well
i
shall
endeavor
that
affection
may
follow
then
after
an
instant
s
deeper
reflection
bah
said
he
to
what
purpose
he
is
an
englishman
and
he
in
turn
went
out
a
little
confused
after
the
combat
so
said
he
i
am
a
but
how
the
devil
am
i
to
share
the
cottage
with
planchet
unless
i
give
him
the
land
and
i
take
the
chateau
or
the
he
takes
the
house
and
i
nonsense
monk
will
never
allow
me
to
share
a
house
he
has
inhabited
with
a
grocer
he
is
too
proud
for
that
besides
why
should
i
say
anything
about
it
to
him
it
was
not
with
the
money
of
the
company
i
have
acquired
that
property
it
was
with
my
alone
it
is
all
mine
then
so
now
i
will
go
and
find
athos
and
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
dwelling
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
chapter
xxxvii
how
d
artagnan
regulated
the
assets
of
the
company
decidedly
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
i
have
struck
a
good
vein
that
star
which
shines
once
in
the
life
of
every
man
which
shone
for
job
and
iris
the
most
unfortunate
of
the
jews
and
the
poorest
of
the
greeks
is
come
at
last
to
shine
on
me
i
will
commit
no
folly
i
will
take
advantage
of
it
it
comes
quite
late
enough
to
find
me
reasonable
he
supped
that
evening
in
very
good
humor
with
his
friend
athos
he
said
nothing
to
him
about
the
expected
donation
but
he
could
not
forbear
questioning
his
friend
while
eating
about
country
produce
sowing
and
planting
athos
replied
complacently
as
he
always
did
his
idea
was
that
d
artagnan
wished
to
become
a
only
he
could
not
help
regretting
more
than
once
the
absence
of
the
lively
humor
and
amusing
sallies
of
the
cheerful
companion
of
former
days
in
fact
d
artagnan
was
so
absorbed
that
with
his
knife
he
took
advantage
of
the
grease
left
at
the
bottom
of
his
plate
to
trace
ciphers
and
make
additions
of
surprising
rotundity
the
order
or
rather
license
for
their
embarkation
arrived
at
athos
s
lodgings
that
evening
while
this
paper
was
remitted
to
the
comte
another
messenger
brought
to
d
artagnan
a
little
bundle
of
parchments
adorned
with
all
the
seals
employed
in
setting
off
property
deeds
in
england
athos
surprised
him
turning
over
the
leaves
of
these
different
acts
which
established
the
transmission
of
property
the
prudent
monk
others
would
say
the
generous
monk
had
commuted
the
donation
into
a
sale
and
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
the
sum
of
fifteen
thousand
crowns
as
the
price
of
the
property
ceded
the
messenger
was
gone
d
artagnan
still
continued
reading
athos
watched
him
with
a
smile
d
artagnan
surprising
one
of
those
smiles
over
his
shoulder
put
the
bundle
in
its
wrapper
i
beg
your
pardon
said
athos
oh
not
at
all
my
friend
replied
the
lieutenant
i
shall
tell
you
no
don
t
tell
me
anything
i
beg
you
orders
are
things
so
sacred
that
to
one
s
brother
one
s
father
the
person
charged
with
such
orders
should
never
open
his
mouth
thus
i
who
speak
to
you
and
love
you
more
tenderly
than
brother
father
or
all
the
world
except
your
raoul
i
shall
love
raoul
still
better
when
he
shall
be
a
man
and
i
shall
have
seen
him
develop
himself
in
all
the
phases
of
his
character
and
his
actions
as
i
have
seen
you
my
friend
you
said
then
that
you
had
an
order
likewise
and
that
you
would
not
communicate
it
to
me
yes
my
dear
d
artagnan
the
gascon
sighed
there
was
a
time
said
he
when
you
would
have
placed
that
order
open
upon
the
table
saying
d
artagnan
read
this
scrawl
to
porthos
aramis
and
to
that
is
true
oh
that
was
the
time
of
youth
confidence
the
generous
season
when
the
blood
commands
when
it
is
warmed
by
feeling
well
athos
will
you
allow
me
to
tell
you
speak
my
friend
that
delightful
time
that
generous
season
that
ruling
by
warm
blood
were
all
very
fine
things
no
doubt
but
i
do
not
regret
them
at
all
it
is
absolutely
like
the
period
of
studies
i
have
constantly
met
with
fools
who
would
boast
of
the
days
of
pensums
ferules
and
crusts
of
dry
bread
it
is
singular
but
i
never
loved
all
that
for
my
part
however
active
and
sober
i
might
be
you
know
if
i
was
so
athos
however
simple
i
might
appear
in
my
clothes
i
would
not
the
less
have
preferred
the
braveries
and
embroideries
of
porthos
to
my
little
perforated
cassock
which
gave
passage
to
the
wind
in
winter
and
the
sun
in
summer
i
should
always
my
friend
mistrust
him
who
would
pretend
to
prefer
evil
to
good
now
in
times
past
all
went
wrong
with
me
and
every
month
found
a
fresh
hole
in
my
cassock
and
in
my
skin
a
gold
crown
less
in
my
poor
purse
of
that
execrable
time
of
small
beer
and
i
regret
absolutely
nothing
nothing
nothing
save
our
friendship
for
within
me
i
have
a
heart
and
it
is
a
miracle
that
heart
has
not
been
dried
up
by
the
wind
of
poverty
which
passed
through
all
the
holes
of
my
cloak
or
pierced
by
the
swords
of
all
shapes
which
passed
through
the
holes
in
my
poor
flesh
do
not
regret
our
friendship
said
athos
that
will
only
die
with
ourselves
friendship
is
composed
above
all
things
of
memories
and
habits
and
if
you
have
just
now
made
a
little
satire
upon
mine
because
i
hesitate
to
tell
you
the
nature
of
my
mission
into
france
who
i
oh
heavens
if
you
knew
my
dear
friend
how
indifferent
all
the
missions
of
the
world
will
henceforth
become
to
me
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
parchment
in
his
vest
pocket
athos
rose
from
the
table
and
called
the
host
in
order
to
pay
the
reckoning
since
i
have
known
you
my
friend
said
d
artagnan
i
have
never
discharged
the
reckoning
porthos
often
did
aramis
sometimes
and
you
you
almost
always
drew
out
your
purse
with
the
dessert
i
am
now
rich
and
should
like
to
try
if
it
is
heroic
to
pay
do
so
said
athos
returning
his
purse
to
his
pocket
the
two
friends
then
directed
their
steps
towards
the
port
not
however
without
d
artagnan
s
frequently
turning
round
to
watch
the
transportation
of
his
dear
crowns
night
had
just
spread
her
thick
veil
over
the
yellow
waters
of
the
thames
they
heard
those
noises
of
casks
and
pulleys
the
preliminaries
of
preparing
to
sail
which
had
so
many
times
made
the
hearts
of
the
musketeers
beat
when
the
dangers
of
the
sea
were
the
least
of
those
they
were
going
to
face
this
time
they
were
to
embark
on
board
a
large
vessel
which
awaited
them
at
gravesend
and
charles
always
delicate
in
small
affairs
had
sent
one
of
his
yachts
with
twelve
men
of
his
scots
guard
to
do
honor
to
the
ambassador
he
was
sending
to
france
at
midnight
the
yacht
had
deposited
its
passengers
on
board
the
vessel
and
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
vessel
landed
the
ambassador
and
his
friend
on
the
wharf
at
boulogne
whilst
the
comte
with
grimaud
was
busy
procuring
horses
to
go
straight
to
paris
d
artagnan
hastened
to
the
hostelry
where
according
to
his
orders
his
little
army
was
to
wait
for
him
these
gentlemen
were
at
breakfast
upon
oysters
fish
and
spiced
brandy
when
d
artagnan
appeared
they
were
all
very
gay
but
not
one
of
them
had
yet
exceeded
the
bounds
of
reason
a
hurrah
of
joy
welcomed
the
general
here
i
am
said
d
artagnan
the
campaign
is
ended
i
am
come
to
bring
each
his
supplement
of
pay
as
agreed
upon
their
eyes
sparkled
i
will
lay
a
wager
there
are
not
at
this
moment
a
hundred
crowns
remaining
in
the
purse
of
the
richest
among
you
that
is
true
cried
they
in
chorus
gentlemen
said
d
artagnan
then
this
is
the
last
order
the
treaty
of
commerce
has
been
concluded
thanks
to
our
which
made
us
masters
of
the
most
skillful
financier
of
england
for
now
i
am
at
liberty
to
confess
to
you
that
the
man
we
had
to
carry
off
was
the
treasurer
of
general
monk
this
word
treasurer
produced
a
certain
effect
on
his
army
d
artagnan
observed
that
the
eyes
of
menneville
alone
did
not
evince
perfect
faith
this
treasurer
he
continued
i
conveyed
to
a
neutral
territory
holland
i
forced
him
to
sign
the
treaty
i
have
even
reconducted
him
to
newcastle
and
he
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
our
proceedings
towards
him
the
deal
coffer
being
always
carried
without
jolting
and
being
lined
softly
i
asked
a
gratification
for
you
here
it
is
he
threw
a
purse
upon
the
cloth
and
all
involuntarily
stretched
out
their
hands
one
moment
my
lambs
said
d
artagnan
if
there
are
profits
there
are
also
charges
oh
oh
murmured
they
we
are
about
to
find
ourselves
my
friends
in
a
position
which
would
not
be
tenable
for
people
without
brains
i
speak
plainly
we
are
between
the
gallows
and
the
bastile
oh
oh
said
the
chorus
that
is
easily
understood
it
was
necessary
to
explain
to
general
monk
the
disappearance
of
his
treasurer
i
waited
for
that
purpose
till
the
moment
of
the
restoration
of
king
charles
who
is
one
of
my
friends
this
army
exchanged
a
glance
of
satisfaction
in
reply
to
the
sufficiently
proud
look
of
d
artagnan
the
king
being
restored
i
restored
to
monk
his
man
of
business
a
little
plucked
it
is
true
but
in
short
i
restored
him
now
general
monk
when
he
pardoned
me
for
he
has
pardoned
me
could
not
help
repeating
these
words
to
me
which
i
charge
every
one
of
you
to
engrave
deeply
there
between
the
eyes
under
the
vault
of
the
cranium
monsieur
the
joke
has
been
a
good
one
but
i
don
t
naturally
like
jokes
if
ever
a
word
of
what
you
have
done
you
understand
me
menneville
escapes
from
your
lips
or
the
lips
of
your
companions
i
have
in
my
government
of
scotland
and
ireland
seven
hundred
and
wooden
gibbets
of
strong
oak
clamped
with
iron
and
freshly
greased
every
week
i
will
make
a
present
of
one
of
these
gibbets
to
each
of
you
and
observe
well
d
artagnan
added
he
observe
it
also
menneville
i
shall
still
have
seven
hundred
and
thirty
left
for
my
private
pleasure
and
still
further
ah
ah
said
the
auxiliaries
is
there
still
more
a
mere
trifle
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
send
to
the
king
of
france
the
treaty
in
question
with
a
request
that
he
will
cast
into
the
bastile
provisionally
and
then
send
to
me
all
who
have
taken
part
in
this
expedition
and
that
is
a
prayer
with
which
the
king
will
certainly
a
cry
of
terror
broke
from
all
corners
of
the
table
there
there
there
said
d
artagnan
this
brave
monk
has
forgotten
one
thing
and
that
is
he
does
not
know
the
name
of
any
one
of
you
i
alone
know
you
and
it
is
not
i
you
well
may
believe
who
will
betray
you
why
should
i
as
for
you
i
can
not
suppose
you
will
be
silly
enough
to
denounce
yourselves
for
then
the
king
to
spare
himself
the
expense
of
feeding
and
lodging
you
will
send
you
off
to
scotland
where
the
seven
hundred
and
gibbets
are
to
be
found
that
is
all
messieurs
i
have
not
another
word
to
add
to
what
i
have
had
the
honor
to
tell
you
i
am
sure
you
have
understood
me
perfectly
well
have
you
not
m
menneville
perfectly
replied
the
latter
now
the
crowns
said
d
artagnan
shut
the
doors
he
cried
and
opened
the
bag
upon
the
table
from
which
rolled
several
fine
gold
crowns
every
one
made
a
movement
towards
the
floor
gently
cried
d
artagnan
let
no
one
stoop
and
then
i
shall
not
be
out
in
my
reckoning
he
found
it
all
right
gave
fifty
of
those
splendid
crowns
to
each
man
and
received
as
many
benedictions
as
he
bestowed
pieces
now
said
he
if
it
were
possible
for
you
to
reform
a
little
if
you
could
become
good
and
honest
citizens
that
is
rather
difficult
said
one
of
the
troop
what
then
captain
said
another
because
i
might
be
able
to
find
you
again
and
who
knows
what
other
good
fortune
he
made
a
sign
to
menneville
who
listened
to
all
he
said
with
a
composed
air
menneville
said
he
come
with
me
adieu
my
brave
fellows
i
need
not
warn
you
to
be
discreet
menneville
followed
him
whilst
the
salutations
of
the
auxiliaries
were
mingled
with
the
sweet
sound
of
the
money
clinking
in
their
pockets
menneville
said
d
artagnan
when
they
were
once
in
the
street
you
were
not
my
dupe
beware
of
being
so
you
did
not
appear
to
have
any
fear
of
the
gibbets
of
monk
or
the
bastile
of
his
majesty
king
louis
but
you
will
do
me
the
favor
of
being
afraid
of
me
then
listen
at
the
smallest
word
that
shall
escape
you
i
will
kill
you
as
i
would
a
fowl
i
have
absolution
from
our
holy
father
the
pope
in
my
pocket
i
assure
you
i
know
absolutely
nothing
my
dear
d
artagnan
and
that
your
words
have
all
been
to
me
so
many
articles
of
faith
i
was
quite
sure
you
were
an
intelligent
fellow
said
the
musketeer
i
have
tried
you
for
a
length
of
time
these
fifty
crowns
which
i
give
you
above
the
rest
will
prove
the
esteem
i
have
for
you
take
them
thanks
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
menneville
with
that
sum
you
can
really
become
an
honest
man
replied
d
artagnan
in
the
most
serious
tone
possible
it
would
be
disgraceful
for
a
mind
like
yours
and
a
name
you
no
longer
dare
to
bear
to
sink
forever
under
the
rust
of
an
evil
life
become
a
gallant
man
menneville
and
live
for
a
year
upon
those
hundred
gold
crowns
it
is
a
good
provision
twice
the
pay
of
a
high
officer
in
a
year
come
to
me
and
mordioux
i
will
make
something
of
you
menneville
swore
as
his
comrades
had
sworn
that
he
would
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
and
yet
some
one
must
have
spoken
and
as
certainly
it
was
not
one
of
the
nine
companions
and
quite
as
certainly
it
was
not
menneville
it
must
have
been
d
artagnan
who
in
his
quality
of
a
gascon
had
his
tongue
very
near
to
his
lips
for
in
short
if
it
were
not
he
who
could
it
be
and
how
can
it
be
explained
that
the
secret
of
the
deal
coffer
pierced
with
holes
should
come
to
our
knowledge
and
in
so
complete
a
fashion
that
we
have
as
has
been
seen
related
the
history
of
it
in
all
its
most
minute
details
details
which
besides
throw
a
light
as
new
as
unexpected
upon
all
that
portion
of
the
history
of
england
which
has
been
left
up
to
the
present
day
completely
in
darkness
by
the
historian
of
our
neighbors
chapter
xxxviii
the
french
grocer
had
already
been
established
in
the
seventeenth
century
his
accounts
once
settled
and
his
recommendations
made
d
artagnan
thought
of
nothing
but
returning
to
paris
as
soon
as
possible
athos
on
his
part
was
anxious
to
reach
home
and
to
rest
a
little
however
whole
the
character
and
the
man
may
remain
after
the
fatigues
of
a
voyage
the
traveler
perceives
with
pleasure
at
the
close
of
the
day
even
though
the
day
has
been
a
fine
one
that
night
is
approaching
and
will
bring
a
little
sleep
with
it
so
from
boulogne
to
paris
jogging
on
side
by
side
the
two
friends
in
some
degree
absorbed
each
in
his
individual
thoughts
conversed
of
nothing
sufficiently
interesting
for
us
to
repeat
to
our
readers
each
of
them
given
up
to
his
personal
reflections
and
constructing
his
future
after
his
own
fashion
was
above
all
anxious
to
abridge
the
distance
by
speed
athos
and
d
artagnan
arrived
at
the
gates
of
paris
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
after
leaving
boulogne
where
are
you
going
my
friend
asked
athos
i
shall
direct
my
course
straight
to
my
hotel
and
i
straight
to
my
partner
s
to
planchet
s
yes
at
the
pilon
d
or
well
but
shall
we
not
meet
again
if
you
remain
in
paris
yes
for
i
shall
stay
here
no
after
having
embraced
raoul
with
whom
i
have
appointed
a
meeting
at
my
hotel
i
shall
set
out
immediately
for
la
fere
well
adieu
then
dear
and
true
friend
au
revoir
i
should
rather
say
for
why
can
you
not
come
and
live
with
me
at
blois
you
are
free
you
are
rich
i
shall
purchase
for
you
if
you
like
a
handsome
estate
in
the
vicinity
of
cheverny
or
of
bracieux
on
the
one
side
you
will
have
the
finest
woods
in
the
world
which
join
those
of
chambord
on
the
other
admirable
marshes
you
who
love
sporting
and
who
whether
you
admit
it
or
not
are
a
poet
my
dear
friend
you
will
find
pheasants
rail
and
teal
without
counting
sunsets
and
excursions
on
the
water
to
make
you
fancy
yourself
nimrod
and
apollo
themselves
while
awaiting
the
purchase
you
can
live
at
la
fere
and
we
shall
go
together
to
fly
our
hawks
among
the
vines
as
louis
xiii
used
to
do
that
is
a
quiet
amusement
for
old
fellows
like
us
d
artagnan
took
the
hands
of
athos
in
his
own
dear
count
said
he
i
shall
say
neither
yes
nor
let
me
pass
in
paris
the
time
necessary
for
the
regulation
of
my
affairs
and
accustom
myself
by
degrees
to
the
heavy
and
glittering
idea
which
is
beating
in
my
brain
and
dazzles
me
i
am
rich
you
see
and
from
this
moment
until
the
time
when
i
shall
have
acquired
the
habit
of
being
rich
i
know
myself
and
i
shall
be
an
insupportable
animal
now
i
am
not
enough
of
a
fool
to
wish
to
appear
to
have
lost
my
wits
before
a
friend
like
you
athos
the
cloak
is
handsome
the
cloak
is
richly
gilded
but
it
is
new
and
does
not
seem
to
fit
me
athos
smiled
so
be
it
said
he
but
a
propos
of
this
cloak
dear
d
artagnan
will
you
allow
me
to
offer
you
a
little
advice
yes
willingly
you
will
not
be
angry
proceed
when
wealth
comes
to
a
man
late
in
life
or
all
at
once
that
man
in
order
not
to
change
must
most
likely
become
a
miser
that
is
to
say
not
spend
much
more
money
than
he
had
done
before
or
else
become
a
prodigal
and
contract
so
many
debts
as
to
become
poor
again
oh
but
what
you
say
looks
very
much
like
a
sophism
my
dear
philosophic
friend
i
do
not
think
so
will
you
become
a
miser
no
pardieu
i
was
one
already
having
nothing
let
us
change
then
be
prodigal
still
less
mordioux
debts
terrify
me
creditors
appear
to
me
by
anticipation
like
those
devils
who
turn
the
damned
upon
the
gridirons
and
as
patience
is
not
my
dominant
virtue
i
am
always
tempted
to
thrash
those
devils
you
are
the
wisest
man
i
know
and
stand
in
no
need
of
advice
from
any
one
great
fools
must
they
be
who
think
they
have
anything
to
teach
you
but
are
we
not
at
the
rue
saint
honore
yes
dear
athos
look
yonder
on
the
left
that
small
long
white
house
is
the
hotel
where
i
lodge
you
may
observe
that
it
has
but
two
stories
i
occupy
the
first
the
other
is
let
to
an
officer
whose
duties
oblige
him
to
be
absent
eight
or
nine
months
in
the
year
so
i
am
in
that
house
as
in
my
own
home
without
the
expense
oh
how
well
you
manage
athos
what
order
and
what
liberality
they
are
what
i
wish
to
unite
but
of
what
use
trying
that
comes
from
birth
and
can
not
be
acquired
you
are
a
flatterer
well
adieu
dear
friend
a
propos
remember
me
to
master
planchet
he
always
was
a
bright
fellow
and
a
man
of
heart
too
athos
adieu
and
the
separated
during
all
this
conversation
d
artagnan
had
not
for
a
moment
lost
sight
of
a
certain
in
whose
panniers
under
some
hay
were
spread
the
sacoches
messenger
s
bags
with
the
portmanteau
nine
o
clock
was
striking
at
planchet
s
helps
were
shutting
up
his
shop
d
artagnan
stopped
the
postilion
who
rode
the
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
lombards
under
a
and
calling
one
of
planchet
s
boys
he
desired
him
not
only
to
take
care
of
the
two
horses
but
to
watch
the
postilion
after
which
he
entered
the
shop
of
the
grocer
who
had
just
finished
supper
and
who
in
his
little
private
room
was
with
a
degree
of
anxiety
consulting
the
calendar
on
which
every
evening
he
scratched
out
the
day
that
was
past
at
the
moment
when
planchet
according
to
his
daily
custom
with
the
back
of
his
pen
erased
another
day
d
artagnan
kicked
the
door
with
his
foot
and
the
blow
made
his
steel
spur
jingle
oh
good
lord
cried
planchet
the
worthy
grocer
could
say
no
more
he
had
just
perceived
his
partner
d
artagnan
entered
with
a
bent
back
and
a
dull
eye
the
gascon
had
an
idea
with
regard
to
planchet
good
god
thought
the
grocer
looking
earnestly
at
the
traveler
he
looks
sad
the
musketeer
sat
down
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
planchet
with
a
horrible
palpitation
of
the
heart
here
you
are
and
your
health
tolerably
good
planchet
tolerably
good
said
d
artagnan
with
a
profound
sigh
you
have
not
been
wounded
i
hope
phew
ah
i
see
continued
planchet
more
and
more
alarmed
the
expedition
has
been
a
trying
one
yes
said
d
artagnan
a
shudder
ran
down
planchet
s
back
i
should
like
to
have
something
to
drink
said
the
musketeer
raising
his
head
piteously
planchet
ran
to
the
cupboard
and
poured
out
to
d
artagnan
some
wine
in
a
large
glass
d
artagnan
examined
the
bottle
what
wine
is
that
asked
he
alas
that
which
you
prefer
monsieur
said
planchet
that
good
old
anjou
wine
which
was
one
day
nearly
costing
us
all
so
dear
ah
replied
d
artagnan
with
a
melancholy
smile
ah
my
poor
planchet
ought
i
still
to
drink
good
wine
come
my
dear
master
said
planchet
making
a
effort
whilst
all
his
contracted
muscles
his
pallor
and
his
trembling
betrayed
the
most
acute
anguish
come
i
have
been
a
soldier
and
consequently
have
some
courage
do
not
make
me
linger
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
our
money
is
lost
is
it
not
before
he
answered
d
artagnan
took
his
time
and
that
appeared
an
age
to
the
poor
grocer
nevertheless
he
did
nothing
but
turn
about
on
his
chair
and
if
that
were
the
case
said
he
slowly
moving
his
head
up
and
down
if
that
were
the
case
what
would
you
say
my
dear
friend
planchet
from
being
pale
turned
yellow
it
might
have
been
thought
he
was
going
to
swallow
his
tongue
so
full
became
his
throat
so
red
were
his
eyes
twenty
thousand
livres
murmured
he
twenty
thousand
livres
and
yet
d
artagnan
with
his
neck
elongated
his
legs
stretched
out
and
his
hands
hanging
listlessly
looked
like
a
statue
of
discouragement
planchet
drew
up
a
sigh
from
the
deepest
cavities
of
his
breast
well
said
he
i
see
how
it
is
let
us
be
men
it
is
all
over
is
it
not
the
principal
thing
is
monsieur
that
your
life
is
safe
doubtless
doubtless
life
is
something
but
i
am
ruined
cordieu
monsieur
said
planchet
if
it
is
so
we
must
not
despair
for
that
you
shall
become
a
grocer
with
me
i
shall
take
you
for
my
partner
we
will
share
the
profits
and
if
there
should
be
no
more
profits
well
why
then
we
shall
share
the
almonds
raisins
and
prunes
and
we
will
nibble
together
the

with
great
emotion
thou
art
a
brave
fellow
on
my
honor
planchet
you
have
not
been
playing
a
part
have
you
you
have
not
seen
the
with
the
bags
under
the
shed
yonder
what
horse
what
bags
said
planchet
whose
trembling
heart
began
to
suggest
that
d
artagnan
was
mad
why
the
english
bags
mordioux
said
d
artagnan
all
radiant
quite
transfigured
ah
good
god
articulated
planchet
drawing
back
before
the
dazzling
fire
of
his
looks
imbecile
cried
d
artagnan
you
think
me
mad
mordioux
on
the
contrary
never
was
my
head
more
clear
or
my
heart
more
joyous
to
the
bags
planchet
to
the
bags
but
to
what
bags
good
heavens
d
artagnan
pushed
planchet
towards
the
window
under
that
shed
yonder
don
t
you

a
horse
yes
don
t
you
see
how
his
back
is
laden
yes

you

talking
with

shouted
d

the
horse
screamed
planchet
now
give
ten
livres
to
the
postilion
said
d
artagnan
in
the
tone
he
would
have
employed
in
commanding
a
maneuver
two
lads
to
bring
up
the
first
two
bags
two
to
bring
up
the
two
last
and
move
mordioux
be
lively
planchet
rushed
down
the
stairs
as
if
the
devil
had
been
at
his
heels
a
moment
later
the
lads
ascended
the
stairs
bending
beneath
their
burden
d
artagnan
sent
them
off
to
their
garrets
carefully
closed
the
door
and
addressing
planchet
who
in
his
turn
looked
a
little
wild
now
we
are
by
ourselves
said
he
and
he
spread
upon
the
floor
a
large
cover
and
emptied
the
first
bag
into
it
planchet
did
the
same
with
the
second
then
d
artagnan
all
in
a
tremble
let
out
the
precious
bowels
of
the
third
with
a
knife
when
planchet
heard
the
provoking
sound
of
the
silver
and
gold
when
he
saw
bubbling
out
of
the
bags
the
shining
crowns
which
glittered
like
fish
from
the
when
he
felt
himself
plunging
his
hands
up
to
the
elbows
in
that
still
rising
tide
of
yellow
and
white
coins
a
giddiness
seized
him
and
like
a
man
struck
by
lightning
he
sank
heavily
down
upon
the
enormous
heap
which
his
weight
caused
to
roll
away
in
all
directions
planchet
suffocated
with
joy
had
lost
his
senses
d
artagnan
threw
a
glass
of
white
wine
in
his
face
which
incontinently
recalled
him
to
life
ah
good
heavens
good
heavens
good
heavens
said
planchet
wiping
his
mustache
and
beard
at
that
time
as
they
do
now
grocers
wore
the
cavalier
mustache
and
the
lansquenet
beard

the
money
baths
already
rare
in
those
days
have
become
almost
unknown
now

said
d
artagnan
there
are
a
hundred
thousand

your
share
if
you
please
and
i
will
draw
mine
oh

lovely

monsieur
d
artagnan
the
lovely
sum
i
confess
that
half
an
hour
ago
i
regretted
that
i
had
to
give
you
so
much
but
now
i
no
longer
regret
it
thou
art
a
brave
grocer
planchet
there
let
us
close
our
accounts
for
as
they
say
short
reckonings
make
long
friends
oh
rather
in
the
first
place
tell
me
the
whole

said
planchet
that
must
be
better
than
the
money
ma
foi
said
d
artagnan
stroking
his
mustache
i
can
t
say
no
and
if
ever
the
historian
turns
to
me
for
information
he
will
be
able
to
say
he
has
not
dipped
his
bucket
into
a
dry
spring
listen
then
planchet
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
i
shall
build
piles
of
crowns

my
dear
master
well
this
is

his
breath

mazarin
s
gaming
party
in
a
large
chamber
of
the
palais
royal
hung
with
a
dark
colored
velvet
which
threw
into
strong
relief
the
gilded
frames
of
a
great
number
of
magnificent
pictures
on
the
evening
of
the
arrival
of
the
two
frenchmen
the
whole
court
was
assembled
before
the
alcove
of
le
cardinal
de
mazarin
who
gave
a
card
party
to
the
king
and
queen
a
small
screen
separated
three
prepared
tables
at
one
of
these
tables
the
king
and
the
two
queens
were
seated
louis
placed
opposite
to
the
young
queen
his
wife
smiled
upon
her
with
an
expression
of
real
happiness
anne
of
austria
held
the
cards
against
the
cardinal
and
her
assisted
her
in
the
game
when
she
was
not
engaged
in
smiling
at
her
husband
as
for
the
cardinal
who
was
lying
on
his
bed
with
a
weary
and
careworn
face
his
cards
were
held
by
the
comtesse
de
soissons
and
he
watched
them
with
an
incessant
look
of
interest
and
cupidity
the
cardinal
s
face
had
been
painted
by
bernouin
but
the
rouge
which
glowed
only
on
his
cheeks
threw
into
stronger
contrast
the
sickly
pallor
of
his
countenance
and
the
shining
yellow
of
his
brow
his
eyes
alone
acquired
a
more
brilliant
luster
from
this
auxiliary
and
upon
those
sick
man
s
eyes
were
from
time
to
time
turned
the
uneasy
looks
of
the
king
the
queen
and
the
courtiers
the
fact
is
that
the
two
eyes
of
the
signor
mazarin
were
the
stars
more
or
less
brilliant
in
which
the
france
of
the
seventeenth
century
read
its
destiny
every
evening
and
every
morning
monseigneur
neither
won
nor
lost
he
was
therefore
neither
gay
nor
sad
it
was
a
stagnation
in
which
full
of
pity
for
him
anne
of
austria
would
not
have
willingly
left
him
but
in
order
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
sick
man
by
some
brilliant
stroke
she
must
have
either
won
or
lost
to
win
would
have
been
dangerous
because
mazarin
would
have
changed
his
indifference
into
an
ugly
grimace
to
lose
would
likewise
have
been
dangerous
because
she
must
have
cheated
and
the
infanta
who
watched
her
game
would
doubtless
have
exclaimed
against
her
partiality
for
mazarin
profiting
by
this
calm
the
courtiers
were
chatting
when
not
in
a
bad
humor
de
mazarin
was
a
very
debonnaire
prince
and
he
who
prevented
nobody
from
singing
provided
they
paid
was
not
tyrant
enough
to
prevent
people
from
talking
provided
they
made
up
their
minds
to
lose
they
were
therefore
chatting
at
the
first
table
the
king
s
younger
brother
philip
duc
d
anjou
was
admiring
his
handsome
face
in
the
glass
of
a
box
his
favorite
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
prince
s
chair
was
listening
with
secret
envy
to
the
comte
de
guiche
another
of
philip
s
favorites
who
was
relating
in
choice
terms
the
various
vicissitudes
of
fortune
of
the
royal
adventurer
charles
ii
he
told
as
so
many
fabulous
events
all
the
history
of
his
perigrinations
in
scotland
and
his
terrors
when
the
enemy
s
party
was
so
closely
on
his
track
of
nights
spent
in
trees
and
days
spent
in
hunger
and
combats
by
degrees
the
fate
of
the
unfortunate
king
interested
his
auditors
so
greatly
that
the
play
languished
even
at
the
royal
table
and
the
young
king
with
a
pensive
look
and
downcast
eye
followed
without
appearing
to
give
any
attention
to
it
the
smallest
details
of
this
odyssey
very
picturesquely
related
by
the
comte
de
guiche
the
comtesse
de
soissons
interrupted
the
narrator
confess
count
you
are
inventing
madame
i
am
repeating
like
a
parrot
all
the
stories
related
to
me
by
different
englishmen
to
my
shame
i
am
compelled
to
say
i
am
as
exact
as
a
copy
charles
ii
would
have
died
before
he
could
have
endured
all
that
louis
xiv
raised
his
intelligent
and
proud
head
madame
said
he
in
a
grave
tone
still
partaking
something
of
the
timid
child
monsieur
le
cardinal
will
tell
you
that
during
my
minority
the
affairs
of
france
were
in
jeopardy
and
that
if
i
had
been
older
and
obliged
to
take
sword
in
hand
it
would
sometimes
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
the
evening
meal
thanks
to
god
said
the
cardinal
who
spoke
for
the
first
time
your
majesty
exaggerates
and
your
supper
has
always
been
ready
with
that
of
your
servants
the
king
colored
oh
cried
philip
inconsiderately
from
his
place
and
without
ceasing
to
admire
himself
i
recollect
once
at
melun
the
supper
was
laid
for
nobody
and
that
the
king
ate
of
a
slice
of
bread
and
abandoned
to
me
the
other
third
the
whole
assembly
seeing
mazarin
smile
began
to
laugh
courtiers
flatter
kings
with
the
remembrance
of
past
distresses
as
with
the
hopes
of
future
good
fortune
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
the
crown
of
france
has
always
remained
firm
upon
the
heads
of
its
kings
anne
of
austria
hastened
to
say
and
that
it
has
fallen
off
of
that
of
the
king
of
england
and
when
by
chance
that
crown
oscillated
a
little
for
there
are
as
well
as
earthquakes
every
time
i
say
that
rebellion
threatened
it
a
good
victory
restored
tranquillity
with
a
few
gems
added
to
the
crown
said
mazarin
the
comte
de
guiche
was
silent
the
king
composed
his
countenance
and
mazarin
exchanged
looks
with
anne
of
austria
as
if
to
thank
her
for
her
intervention
it
is
of
no
consequence
said
philip
smoothing
his
hair
my
cousin
charles
is
not
handsome
but
he
is
very
brave
and
fought
like
a
landsknecht
and
if
he
continues
to
fight
thus
no
doubt
he
will
finish
by
gaining
a
battle
like
rocroi
he
has
no
soldiers
interrupted
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
the
king
of
holland
his
ally
will
give
him
some
i
would
willingly
have
given
him
some
if
i
had
been
king
of
france
louis
xiv
blushed
excessively
mazarin
affected
to
be
more
attentive
to
his
game
than
ever
by
this
time
resumed
the
comte
de
guiche
the
fortune
of
this
unhappy
prince
is
decided
if
he
has
been
deceived
by
monk
he
is
ruined
imprisonment
perhaps
death
will
finish
what
exiles
battles
and
privations
have
commenced
mazarin
s
brow
became
clouded
it
is
certain
said
louis
that
his
majesty
charles
has
quitted
the
hague
quite
certain
your
majesty
replied
the
young
man
my
father
has
received
a
letter
containing
all
the
details
it
is
even
known
that
the
king
has
landed
at
dover
some
fishermen
saw
him
entering
the
port
the
rest
is
still
a
mystery
i
should
like
to
know
the
rest
said
philip
impetuously
you
know
you
my
brother
louis
xiv
colored
again
that
was
the
third
time
within
an
hour
ask
my
lord
cardinal
replied
he
in
a
tone
which
made
mazarin
anne
of
austria
and
everybody
else
open
their
eyes
that
means
my
son
said
anne
of
austria
laughing
that
the
king
does
not
like
affairs
of
state
to
be
talked
of
out
of
the
council
philip
received
the
reprimand
with
good
grace
and
bowed
first
smiling
at
his
brother
and
then
at
his
mother
but
mazarin
saw
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
a
group
was
about
to
be
formed
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
that
the
duc
d
anjou
with
the
comte
de
guiche
and
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
prevented
from
talking
aloud
might
say
in
a
whisper
what
it
was
not
convenient
should
be
said
he
was
beginning
then
to
dart
at
them
glances
full
of
mistrust
and
uneasiness
inviting
anne
of
austria
to
throw
perturbation
in
the
midst
of
the
unlawful
assembly
when
suddenly
bernouin
entering
from
behind
the
tapestry
of
the
bedroom
whispered
in
the
ear
of
mazarin
monseigneur
an
envoy
from
his
majesty
the
king
of
england
mazarin
could
not
help
exhibiting
a
slight
emotion
which
was
perceived
by
the
king
to
avoid
being
indiscreet
rather
than
to
appear
useless
louis
xiv
rose
immediately
and
approaching
his
eminence
wished
him
all
the
assembly
had
risen
with
a
great
noise
of
rolling
of
chairs
and
tables
being
pushed
away
let
everybody
depart
by
degrees
said
mazarin
in
a
whisper
to
louis
and
be
so
good
as
to
excuse
me
a
few
minutes
i
am
going
to
dispatch
an
affair
about
which
i
wish
to
converse
with
your
majesty
this
very
evening
and
the
queens
asked
louis
xiv
and
le
duc
d
anjou
said
his
eminence
at
the
same
time
he
turned
round
in
his
ruelle
the
curtains
of
which
in
falling
concealed
the
bed
the
cardinal
nevertheless
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
conspirators
le
comte
de
guiche
said
he
in
a
fretful
voice
whilst
putting
on
behind
the
curtain
his
with
the
assistance
of
bernouin
i
am
here
my
lord
said
the
young
man
as
he
approached
take
my
cards
you
are
lucky
win
a
little
money
for
me
of
these
gentlemen
yes
my
lord
the
young
man
sat
down
at
the
table
from
which
the
king
withdrew
to
talk
with
the
two
queens
a
serious
game
was
commenced
between
the
comte
and
several
rich
courtiers
in
the
meantime
philip
was
discussing
the
questions
of
dress
with
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
and
they
had
ceased
to
hear
the
rustling
of
the
cardinal
s
silk
robe
from
behind
the
curtain
his
eminence
had
followed
bernouin
into
the
closet
adjoining
the
bedroom
chapter
xl
an
affair
of
state
the
cardinal
on
passing
into
his
cabinet
found
the
comte
de
la
fere
who
was
waiting
for
him
engaged
in
admiring
a
very
fine
raphael
placed
over
a
sideboard
covered
with
a
plate
his
eminence
came
in
softly
lightly
and
as
silently
as
a
shadow
and
surprised
the
countenance
of
the
comte
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
pretending
to
divine
by
the
simple
expression
of
the
face
of
his
interlocutor
what
would
be
the
result
of
the
conversation
but
this
time
mazarin
was
foiled
in
his
expectation
he
read
nothing
upon
the
face
of
athos
not
even
the
respect
he
was
accustomed
to
see
on
all
faces
athos
was
dressed
in
black
with
a
simple
lacing
of
silver
he
wore
the
holy
ghost
the
garter
and
the
golden
fleece
three
orders
of
such
importance
that
a
king
alone
or
else
a
player
could
wear
them
at
once
mazarin
rummaged
a
long
time
in
his
somewhat
troubled
memory
to
recall
the
name
he
ought
to
give
to
this
icy
figure
but
he
did
not
succeed
i
am
told
said
he
at
length
you
have
a
message
from
england
for
me
and
he
sat
down
dismissing
bernouin
who
in
his
quality
of
secretary
was
getting
his
pen
ready
on
the
part
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
england
yes
your
eminence
you
speak
very
good
french
for
an
englishman
monsieur
said
mazarin
graciously
looking
through
his
fingers
at
the
holy
ghost
garter
and
golden
fleece
but
more
particularly
at
the
face
of
the
messenger
i
am
not
an
englishman
but
a
frenchman
monsieur
le
cardinal
replied
athos
it
is
remarkable
that
the
king
of
england
should
choose
a
frenchman
for
his
ambassador
it
is
an
excellent
augury
your
name
monsieur
if
you
please
comte
de
la
fere
replied
athos
bowing
more
slightly
than
the
ceremonial
and
pride
of
the
minister
required
mazarin
bent
his
shoulders
as
if
to
say
i
do
not
know
that
name
athos
did
not
alter
his
carriage
and
you
come
monsieur
continued
mazarin
to
tell
me
i
come
on
the
part
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
great
britain
to
announce
to
the
king
of
france
mazarin
frowned
to
announce
to
the
king
of
france
continued
athos
imperturbably
the
happy
restoration
of
his
majesty
charles
ii
to
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
this
shade
did
not
escape
his
cunning
eminence
mazarin
was
too
much
accustomed
to
mankind
not
to
see
in
the
cold
and
almost
haughty
politeness
of
athos
an
index
of
hostility
which
was
not
of
the
temperature
of
that
called
a
court
you
have
powers
i
suppose
asked
mazarin
in
a
short
querulous
tone
yes
monseigneur
and
the
word
monseigneur
came
so
painfully
from
the
lips
of
athos
that
it
might
be
said
it
skinned
them
athos
took
from
an
embroidered
velvet
bag
which
he
carried
under
his
doublet
a
dispatch
the
cardinal
held
out
his
hand
for
it
your
pardon
monseigneur
said
athos
my
dispatch
is
for
the
king
since
you
are
a
frenchman
monsieur
you
ought
to
know
the
position
of
a
prime
minister
at
the
court
of
france
there
was
a
time
replied
athos
when
i
occupied
myself
with
the
importance
of
prime
ministers
but
i
have
formed
long
ago
a
resolution
to
treat
no
longer
with
any
but
the
king
then
monsieur
said
mazarin
who
began
to
be
irritated
you
will
neither
see
the
minister
nor
the
king
mazarin
rose
athos
replaced
his
dispatch
in
its
bag
bowed
gravely
and
made
several
steps
towards
the
door
this
coolness
exasperated
mazarin
what
strange
diplomatic
proceedings
are
these
cried
he
have
we
returned
to
the
times
when
cromwell
sent
us
bullies
in
the
guise
of
charges
d
affaires
you
want
nothing
monsieur
but
the
steel
cap
on
your
head
and
a
bible
at
your
girdle
monsieur
said
athos
dryly
i
have
never
had
as
you
have
the
advantage
of
treating
with
cromwell
and
i
have
only
seen
his
charges
d
affaires
sword
in
hand
i
am
therefore
ignorant
of
how
he
treated
with
prime
ministers
as
for
the
king
of
england
charles
i
know
that
when
he
writes
to
his
majesty
king
louis
he
does
not
write
to
his
eminence
the
cardinal
mazarin
i
see
no
diplomacy
in
that
distinction
ah
cried
mazarin
raising
his
attenuated
hand
and
striking
his
head
i
remember
now
athos
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
yes
that
is
it
said
the
cardinal
continuing
to
look
at
his
interlocutor
yes
that
is
certainly
it
i
know
you
now
monsieur
ah
diavolo
i
am
no
longer
astonished
in
fact
i
was
astonished
that
with
your
eminence
s
excellent
memory
replied
athos
smiling
you
had
not
recognized
me
before
always
refractory
and
grumbling
monsieur
monsieur
what
do
they
call
you
stop
a
name
of
a
river
potamos
no
the
name
of
an
island
naxos
no
per
giove
the
name
of
a
mountain
athos
now
i
have
it
delighted
to
see
you
again
and
to
be
no
longer
at
rueil
where
you
and
your
damned
companions
made
me
pay
ransom
fronde
still
fronde
accursed
fronde
oh
what
grudges
why
monsieur
have
your
antipathies
survived
mine
if
any
one
has
cause
to
complain
i
think
it
could
not
be
you
who
got
out
of
the
affair
not
only
in
a
sound
skin
but
with
the
cordon
of
the
holy
ghost
around
your
neck
my
lord
cardinal
replied
athos
permit
me
not
to
enter
into
considerations
of
that
kind
i
have
a
mission
to
fulfill
will
you
facilitate
the
means
of
my
fulfilling
that
mission
or
will
you
not
i
am
astonished
said
mazarin
quite
delighted
at
having
recovered
his
memory
and
bristling
with
malice
i
am
astonished
monsieur
athos
that
a
frondeur
like
you
should
have
accepted
a
mission
for
the
perfidious
mazarin
as
used
to
be
said
in
the
good
old
times
and
mazarin
began
to
laugh
in
spite
of
a
painful
cough
which
cut
short
his
sentences
converting
them
into
sobs
i
have
only
accepted
the
mission
near
the
king
of
france
monsieur
le
cardinal
retorted
the
comte
though
with
less
asperity
for
he
thought
he
had
sufficiently
the
advantage
to
show
himself
moderate
and
yet
monsieur
le
frondeur
said
mazarin
gayly
the
affair
which
you
have
taken
in
charge
must
from
the
king
with
which
i
have
been
given
in
charge
monseigneur
i
do
not
run
after
affairs
be
it
so
i
say
that
this
negotiation
must
pass
through
my
hands
let
us
lose
no
precious
time
then
tell
me
the
conditions
i
have
had
the
honor
of
assuring
your
eminence
that
only
the
letter
of
his
majesty
king
charles
ii
contains
the
revelation
of
his
wishes
pooh
you
are
ridiculous
with
your
obstinacy
monsieur
athos
it
is
plain
you
have
kept
company
with
the
puritans
yonder
as
to
your
secret
i
know
it
better
than
you
do
and
you
have
done
wrongly
perhaps
in
not
having
shown
some
respect
for
a
very
old
and
suffering
man
who
has
labored
much
during
his
life
and
kept
the
field
for
his
ideas
as
bravely
as
you
have
for
yours
you
will
not
communicate
your
letter
to
me
you
will
say
nothing
to
me
very
well
come
with
me
into
my
chamber
you
shall
speak
to
the
king
and
before
the
now
then
one
last
word
who
gave
you
the
fleece
i
remember
you
passed
for
having
the
garter
but
as
to
the
fleece
i
do
not
know
recently
my
lord
spain
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
his
majesty
louis
sent
king
charles
ii
a
brevet
of
the
fleece
in
blank
charles
ii
immediately
transmitted
it
to
me
filling
up
the
blank
with
my
name
mazarin
arose
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
bernouin
he
returned
to
his
ruelle
at
the
moment
the
name
of
le
prince
was
being
announced
the
prince
de
conde
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
the
conqueror
of
rocroi
lens
and
nordlingen
was
in
fact
entering
the
apartment
of
monseigneur
de
mazarin
followed
by
his
gentlemen
and
had
already
saluted
the
king
when
the
prime
minister
raised
his
curtain
athos
had
time
to
see
raoul
pressing
the
hand
of
the
comte
de
guiche
and
send
him
a
smile
in
return
for
his
respectful
bow
he
had
time
likewise
to
see
the
radiant
countenance
of
the
cardinal
when
he
perceived
before
him
upon
the
table
an
enormous
heap
of
gold
which
the
comte
de
guiche
had
won
in
a
run
of
luck
after
his
eminence
had
confided
his
cards
to
him
so
forgetting
ambassador
embassy
and
prince
his
first
thought
was
of
the
gold
what
cried
the
old
man
all
that
won
some
fifty
thousand
crowns
yes
monseigneur
replied
the
comte
de
guiche
rising
must
i
give
up
my
place
to
your
eminence
or
shall
i
continue
give
up
give
up
you
are
mad
you
would
lose
all
you
have
won
peste
my
lord
said
the
prince
de
conde
bowing
monsieur
le
prince
said
the
minister
in
a
careless
tone
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
visit
an
old
sick
friend
a
friend
murmured
the
comte
de
la
fere
at
witnessing
with
stupor
this
monstrous
alliance
of
words
friends
when
the
parties
are
conde
and
mazarin
mazarin
seemed
to
divine
the
thoughts
of
the
frondeur
for
he
smiled
upon
him
with
triumph
and
immediately
sire
said
he
to
the
king
i
have
the
honor
of
presenting
to
your
majesty
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
ambassador
from
his
britannic
majesty
an
affair
of
state
gentlemen
added
he
waving
his
hand
to
all
who
filled
the
chamber
and
who
the
prince
de
conde
at
their
head
all
disappeared
at
the
simple
gesture
raoul
after
a
last
look
cast
at
the
comte
followed
de
conde
philip
of
anjou
and
the
queen
appeared
to
be
consulting
about
departing
a
family
affair
said
mazarin
suddenly
detaining
them
in
their
seats
this
gentleman
is
the
bearer
of
a
letter
in
which
king
charles
completely
restored
to
his
throne
demands
an
alliance
between
monsieur
the
brother
of
the
king
and
mademoiselle
henrietta
of
henry
iv
will
you
remit
your
letter
of
credit
to
the
king
monsieur
le
comte
athos
remained
for
a
minute
stupefied
how
could
the
minister
possibly
know
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
had
never
been
out
of
his
keeping
for
a
single
instant
nevertheless
always
master
of
himself
he
held
out
the
dispatch
to
the
young
king
louis
who
took
it
with
a
blush
a
solemn
silence
reigned
in
the
cardinal
s
chamber
it
was
only
troubled
by
the
dull
sound
of
the
gold
which
mazarin
with
his
yellow
dry
hand
piled
up
in
a
casket
whilst
the
king
was
reading
chapter
xli
the
recital
the
maliciousness
of
the
cardinal
did
not
leave
much
for
the
ambassador
to
say
nevertheless
the
word
restoration
had
struck
the
king
who
addressing
the
comte
upon
whom
his
eyes
had
been
fixed
since
his
entrance
monsieur
said
he
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
give
us
some
details
concerning
the
affairs
of
england
you
come
from
that
country
you
are
a
frenchman
and
the
orders
which
i
see
glittering
upon
your
person
announce
you
to
be
a
man
of
merit
as
well
as
a
man
of
quality
monsieur
said
the
cardinal
turning
towards
the
is
an
ancient
servant
of
your
majesty
s
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
anne
of
austria
was
as
oblivious
as
a
queen
whose
life
had
been
mingled
with
fine
and
stormy
days
she
looked
at
mazarin
whose
evil
smile
promised
her
something
disagreeable
then
she
solicited
from
athos
by
another
look
an
explanation
monsieur
continued
the
cardinal
was
a
treville
musketeer
in
the
service
of
the
late
king
monsieur
is
well
acquainted
with
england
whither
he
has
made
several
voyages
at
various
periods
he
is
a
subject
of
the
highest
merit
these
words
made
allusion
to
all
the
memories
which
anne
of
austria
trembled
to
evoke
england
that
was
her
hatred
of
richelieu
and
her
love
for
buckingham
a
treville
musketeer
that
was
the
whole
odyssey
of
the
triumphs
which
had
made
the
heart
of
the
young
woman
throb
and
of
the
dangers
which
had
been
so
near
overturning
the
throne
of
the
young
queen
these
words
had
much
power
for
they
rendered
mute
and
attentive
all
the
royal
personages
who
with
very
various
sentiments
set
about
recomposing
at
the
same
time
the
mysteries
which
the
young
had
not
seen
and
which
the
old
had
believed
to
be
forever
effaced
speak
monsieur
said
louis
the
first
to
escape
from
troubles
suspicions
and
remembrances
yes
speak
added
mazarin
to
whom
the
little
malicious
thrust
directed
against
anne
of
austria
had
restored
energy
and
gayety
sire
said
the
comte
a
sort
of
miracle
has
changed
the
whole
destiny
of
charles
ii
that
which
men
till
that
time
had
been
unable
to
do
god
resolved
to
accomplish
mazarin
coughed
while
tossing
about
in
his
bed
king
charles
continued
athos
left
the
hague
neither
as
a
fugitive
nor
a
conqueror
but
as
an
absolute
king
who
after
a
distant
voyage
from
his
kingdom
returns
amidst
universal
benedictions
a
great
miracle
indeed
said
mazarin
for
if
the
news
was
true
king
charles
who
has
just
returned
amidst
benedictions
went
away
amidst
the
king
remained
impassible
philip
younger
and
more
frivolous
could
not
repress
a
smile
which
flattered
mazarin
as
an
applause
of
his
pleasantry
it
is
plain
said
the
king
there
is
a
miracle
but
god
who
does
so
much
for
kings
monsieur
le
comte
nevertheless
employs
the
hand
of
man
to
bring
about
the
triumph
of
his
designs
to
what
men
does
charles
ii
principally
owe
his
why
interrupted
mazarin
without
any
regard
for
the
king
s
pride
does
not
your
majesty
know
that
it
is
to
m
monk
i
ought
to
know
it
replied
louis
resolutely
and
yet
i
ask
my
lord
ambassador
the
causes
of
the
change
in
this
general
monk
and
your
majesty
touches
precisely
the
question
replied
athos
for
without
the
miracle
of
which
i
have
had
the
honor
to
speak
general
monk
would
probably
have
remained
an
implacable
enemy
of
charles
ii
god
willed
that
a
strange
bold
and
ingenious
idea
should
enter
into
the
mind
of
a
certain
man
whilst
a
devoted
and
courageous
idea
took
possession
of
the
mind
of
another
man
the
combinations
of
these
two
ideas
brought
about
such
a
change
in
the
position
of
monk
that
from
an
inveterate
enemy
he
became
a
friend
to
the
deposed
king
these
are
exactly
the
details
i
asked
for
said
the
king
who
and
what
are
the
two
men
of
whom
you
speak
two
frenchmen
sire
indeed
i
am
glad
of
that
and
the
two
ideas
said
mazarin
i
am
more
curious
about
ideas
than
about
men
for
my
part
yes
murmured
the
king
the
second
idea
the
devoted
reasonable
idea
the
least
important
sir
was
to
go
and
dig
up
a
million
in
gold
buried
by
king
charles
at
newcastle
and
to
purchase
with
that
gold
the
adherence
of
monk
oh
oh
said
mazarin
reanimated
by
the
word
million
but
newcastle
was
at
the
time
occupied
by
monk
yes
monsieur
le
cardinal
and
that
is
why
i
venture
to
call
the
idea
courageous
as
well
as
devoted
it
was
necessary
if
monk
refused
the
offers
of
the
negotiator
to
reinstate
king
charles
ii
in
possession
of
this
million
which
was
to
be
torn
as
it
were
from
the
loyalty
and
not
the
loyalism
of
general
monk
this
was
effected
in
spite
of
many
difficulties
the
general
proved
to
be
loyal
and
allowed
the
money
to
be
taken
away
it
seems
to
me
said
the
timid
thoughtful
king
that
charles
ii
could
not
have
known
of
this
million
whilst
he
was
in
paris
it
seems
to
me
rejoined
the
cardinal
maliciously
that
his
majesty
the
king
of
great
britain
knew
perfectly
well
of
this
million
but
that
he
preferred
having
two
millions
to
having
one
sire
said
athos
firmly
the
king
of
england
whilst
in
france
was
so
poor
that
he
had
not
even
money
to
take
the
post
so
destitute
of
hope
that
he
frequently
thought
of
dying
he
was
so
entirely
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
million
at
newcastle
that
but
for
a
gentleman
one
of
your
majesty
s
subjects
the
moral
depositary
of
the
million
who
revealed
the
secret
to
king
charles
that
prince
would
still
be
vegetating
in
the
most
cruel
forgetfulness
let
us
pass
on
to
the
strange
bold
and
ingenious
idea
interrupted
mazarin
whose
sagacity
foresaw
a
check
what
was
that
idea
this
monk
formed
the
only
obstacle
to
the
of
the
fallen
king
a
frenchman
imagined
the
idea
of
suppressing
this
obstacle
oh
oh
but
he
is
a
scoundrel
that
frenchman
said
mazarin
and
the
idea
is
not
so
ingenious
as
to
prevent
its
author
being
tied
up
by
the
neck
at
the
place
de
greve
by
decree
of
the
parliament
your
eminence
is
mistaken
replied
athos
dryly
i
did
not
say
that
the
frenchman
in
question
had
resolved
to
assassinate
monk
but
only
to
suppress
him
the
words
of
the
french
language
have
a
value
which
the
gentlemen
of
france
know
perfectly
besides
this
is
an
affair
of
war
and
when
men
serve
kings
against
their
enemies
they
are
not
to
be
condemned
by
a
parliament
god
is
their
judge
this
french
gentleman
then
formed
the
idea
of
gaining
possession
of
the
person
of
monk
and
he
executed
his
plan
the
king
became
animated
at
the
recital
of
great
actions
the
king
s
younger
brother
struck
the
table
with
his
hand
exclaiming
ah
that
is
fine
he
carried
off
monk
said
the
king
why
monk
was
in
his
camp
and
the
gentleman
was
alone
sire
that
is
marvelous
said
philip
marvelous
indeed
cried
the
king
good
there
are
the
two
little
lions
unchained
murmured
the
cardinal
and
with
an
air
of
spite
which
he
did
not
dissemble
i
am
unacquainted
with
these
details
will
you
guarantee
their
authenticity
monsieur
all
the
more
easily
my
lord
cardinal
from
having
seen
the
events
you
have
yes
monseigneur
the
king
had
involuntarily
drawn
close
to
the
count
the
duc
d
anjou
had
turned
sharply
round
and
pressed
athos
on
the
other
side
what
next
monsieur
what
next
cried
they
both
at
the
same
time
sire
monk
being
taken
by
the
frenchman
was
brought
to
king
charles
at
the
hague
the
king
gave
back
his
freedom
to
monk
and
the
grateful
general
in
return
gave
charles
ii
the
throne
of
great
britain
for
which
so
many
valiant
men
had
fought
in
vain
philip
clapped
his
hands
with
enthusiasm
louis
more
reflective
turned
towards
the
comte
de
la
fere
is
this
true
said
he
in
all
its
details
absolutely
true
sire
that
one
of
my
gentlemen
knew
the
secret
of
the
million
and
kept
it
yes
sire
the
name
of
that
gentleman
it
was
your
humble
servant
said
athos
simply
and
bowing
a
murmur
of
admiration
made
the
heart
of
athos
swell
with
pleasure
he
had
reason
to
be
proud
at
least
mazarin
himself
had
raised
his
arms
towards
heaven
monsieur
said
the
king
i
shall
seek
and
find
means
to
reward
you
athos
made
a
movement
oh
not
for
your
honesty
to
be
paid
for
that
would
humiliate
you
but
i
owe
you
a
reward
for
having
participated
in
the
restoration
of
my
brother
king
charles
ii
certainly
said
mazarin
it
is
the
triumph
of
a
good
cause
which
fills
the
whole
house
of
france
with
joy
said
anne
of
austria
i
continue
said
louis
xiv
is
it
also
true
that
a
single
man
penetrated
to
monk
in
his
camp
and
carried
him
off
that
man
had
ten
auxiliaries
taken
from
a
very
inferior
rank
and
nothing
more
but
them
nothing
more
and
he
is
named
monsieur
d
artagnan
formerly
lieutenant
of
the
musketeers
of
your
majesty
anne
of
austria
colored
mazarin
became
yellow
with
shame
louis
xiv
was
deeply
thoughtful
and
a
drop
of
moisture
fell
from
his
pale
brow
what
men
murmured
he
and
involuntarily
he
darted
a
glance
at
the
minister
which
would
have
terrified
him
if
mazarin
at
the
moment
had
not
concealed
his
head
under
his
pillow
monsieur
said
the
young
duc
d
anjou
placing
his
hand
delicate
and
white
as
that
of
a
woman
upon
the
arm
of
athos
tell
that
brave
man
i
beg
you
that
monsieur
brother
of
the
king
will
drink
his
health
before
five
hundred
of
the
best
gentlemen
of
france
and
on
finishing
those
words
the
young
man
perceiving
that
his
enthusiasm
had
deranged
one
of
his
ruffles
set
to
work
to
put
it
to
rights
with
the
greatest
care
imaginable
let
us
resume
business
sire
interrupted
mazarin
who
never
was
enthusiastic
and
who
wore
no
ruffles
yes
monsieur
replied
louis
xiv
pursue
your
communication
monsieur
le
comte
added
he
turning
towards
athos
athos
immediately
began
and
offered
in
due
form
the
hand
of
the
princess
henrietta
stuart
to
the
young
prince
the
king
s
brother
the
conference
lasted
an
hour
after
which
the
doors
of
the
chamber
were
thrown
open
to
the
courtiers
who
resumed
their
places
as
if
nothing
had
been
kept
from
them
in
the
occupations
of
that
evening
athos
then
found
himself
again
with
raoul
and
the
father
and
son
were
able
to
clasp
each
other
s
hands
chapter
xlii
in
which
mazarin
becomes
prodigal
whilst
mazarin
was
endeavoring
to
recover
from
the
serious
alarm
he
had
just
experienced
athos
and
raoul
were
exchanging
a
few
words
in
a
corner
of
the
apartment
well
here
you
are
at
paris
then
raoul
said
the
comte
yes
monsieur
since
the
return
of
le
prince
i
can
not
converse
freely
with
you
here
because
we
are
observed
but
i
shall
return
home
presently
and
shall
expect
you
as
soon
as
your
duty
permits
raoul
bowed
and
at
that
moment
le
prince
came
up
to
them
the
prince
had
that
clear
and
keen
look
which
distinguishes
birds
of
prey
of
the
noble
species
his
physiognomy
itself
presented
several
distinct
traits
of
this
resemblance
it
is
known
that
in
the
prince
de
conde
the
aquiline
nose
rose
out
sharply
and
incisively
from
a
brow
slightly
retreating
rather
low
than
high
and
according
to
the
railers
of
the
court
a
pitiless
race
without
mercy
even
for
genius
constituted
rather
an
eagle
s
beak
than
a
human
nose
in
the
heir
of
the
illustrious
princes
of
the
house
of
conde
this
penetrating
look
this
imperious
expression
of
the
whole
countenance
generally
disturbed
those
to
whom
the
prince
spoke
more
than
either
majesty
or
regular
beauty
could
have
done
in
the
conqueror
of
rocroi
besides
this
the
fire
mounted
so
suddenly
to
his
projecting
eyes
that
with
the
prince
every
sort
of
animation
resembled
passion
now
on
account
of
his
rank
everybody
at
the
court
respected
le
prince
and
many
even
seeing
only
the
man
carried
their
respect
as
far
as
terror
louis
de
conde
then
advanced
towards
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
raoul
with
the
marked
intention
of
being
saluted
by
the
one
and
of
speaking
with
the
other
no
man
bowed
with
more
reserved
grace
than
the
comte
de
la
fere
he
disdained
to
put
into
a
salutation
all
the
shades
which
a
courtier
ordinarily
borrows
from
the
same
color
the
desire
to
please
athos
knew
his
own
personal
value
and
bowed
to
the
prince
like
a
man
correcting
by
something
sympathetic
and
undefinable
that
which
might
have
appeared
offensive
to
the
pride
of
the
highest
rank
in
the
inflexibility
of
his
attitude
the
prince
was
about
to
speak
to
raoul
athos
forestalled
him
if
le
vicomte
de
bragelonne
said
he
were
not
one
of
the
humble
servants
of
your
royal
highness
i
would
beg
him
to
pronounce
my
name
before
you
mon
prince
i
have
the
honor
to
address
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
said
conde
instantly
my
protector
added
raoul
blushing
one
of
the
most
honorable
men
in
the
kingdom
continued
the
prince
one
of
the
first
gentlemen
of
france
and
of
whom
i
have
heard
so
much
that
i
have
frequently
desired
to
number
him
among
my
friends
an
honor
of
which
i
should
be
unworthy
replied
athos
but
for
the
respect
and
admiration
i
entertain
for
your
royal
highness
monsieur
de
bragelonne
said
the
prince
is
a
good
officer
and
it
is
plainly
seen
that
he
has
been
to
a
good
school
ah
monsieur
le
comte
in
your
time
generals
had
soldiers
that
is
true
my
lord
but
nowadays
soldiers
have
generals
this
compliment
which
savored
so
little
of
flattery
gave
a
thrill
of
joy
to
the
man
whom
already
europe
considered
a
hero
and
who
might
be
thought
to
be
satiated
with
praise
i
regret
very
much
continued
the
prince
that
you
should
have
retired
from
the
service
monsieur
le
comte
for
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
king
will
soon
have
a
war
with
holland
or
england
and
opportunities
for
distinguishing
himself
would
not
be
wanting
for
a
man
who
like
you
knows
great
britain
as
well
as
you
do
france
i
believe
i
may
say
monseigneur
that
i
have
acted
wisely
in
retiring
from
the
service
said
athos
smiling
france
and
great
britain
will
henceforward
live
like
two
sisters
if
i
can
trust
my
presentiments
your
presentiments
stop
monseigneur
listen
to
what
is
being
said
yonder
at
the
table
of
my
lord
the
cardinal
where
they
are
playing
yes
my
lord
the
cardinal
had
just
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
and
made
a
sign
to
the
king
s
brother
who
went
to
him
my
lord
said
the
cardinal
pick
up
if
you
please
all
those
gold
crowns
and
he
pointed
to
the
enormous
pile
of
yellow
and
glittering
pieces
which
the
comte
de
guiche
had
raised
by
degrees
before
him
by
a
surprising
run
of
luck
at
play
for
me
cried
the
duc
d
anjou
those
fifty
thousand
crowns
yes
monseigneur
they
are
yours
do
you
give
them
to
me
i
have
been
playing
on
your
account
monseigneur
replied
the
cardinal
getting
weaker
and
weaker
as
if
this
effort
of
giving
money
had
exhausted
all
his
physical
and
moral
faculties
oh
good
heavens
exclaimed
philip
wild
with
joy
what
a
fortunate
day
and
he
himself
making
a
rake
of
his
fingers
drew
a
part
of
the
sum
into
his
pockets
which
he
filled
and
still
full
a
third
remained
on
the
table
chevalier
said
philip
to
his
favorite
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
come
hither
chevalier
the
favorite
quickly
obeyed
pocket
the
rest
said
the
young
prince
this
singular
scene
was
considered
by
the
persons
present
only
as
a
touching
kind
of
family
fete
the
cardinal
assumed
the
airs
of
a
father
with
the
sons
of
france
and
the
two
princes
had
grown
up
under
his
wing
no
one
then
imputed
to
pride
or
even
impertinence
as
would
be
done
nowadays
this
liberality
on
the
part
of
the
first
minister
the
courtiers
were
satisfied
with
envying
the
the
king
turned
away
his
head
i
never
had
so
much
money
before
said
the
young
prince
joyously
as
he
crossed
the
chamber
with
his
favorite
to
go
to
his
carriage
no
never
what
a
weight
these
crowns
are
but
why
has
monsieur
le
cardinal
given
away
all
this
money
at
once
asked
le
prince
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
he
must
be
very
ill
the
dear
cardinal
yes
my
lord
very
ill
without
doubt
he
looks
very
ill
as
your
royal
highness
may
perceive
but
surely
he
will
die
of
it
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
oh
it
is
incredible
but
comte
tell
me
a
reason
for
it
patience
monseigneur
i
beg
of
you
here
comes
le
duc
d
anjou
talking
with
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
they
spared
us
the
trouble
of
being
indiscreet
listen
to
them
in
fact
the
chevalier
said
to
the
prince
in
a
low
voice
my
lord
it
is
not
natural
for
mazarin
to
give
you
so
much
money
take
care
you
will
let
some
of
the
pieces
fall
my
lord
what
design
has
the
cardinal
upon
you
to
make
him
so
generous
as
i
said
whispered
athos
in
the
prince
s
ear
that
perhaps
is
the
best
reply
to
your
question
tell
me
my
lord
repeated
the
chevalier
impatiently
as
he
was
calculating
by
weighing
them
in
his
pocket
the
quota
of
the
sum
which
had
fallen
to
his
share
by
rebound
my
dear
chevalier
a
wedding
present
how
a
wedding
present
eh
yes
i
am
going
to
be
married
replied
the
duc
d
anjou
without
perceiving
at
the
moment
he
was
passing
the
prince
and
athos
who
both
bowed
respectfully
the
chevalier
darted
at
the
young
duke
a
glance
so
strange
and
so
malicious
that
the
comte
de
la
fere
quite
started
on
beholding
it
you
you
to
be
married
repeated
he
oh
that
s
impossible
you
would
not
commit
such
a
folly
bah
i
don
t
do
it
myself
i
am
made
to
do
it
replied
the
duc
d
anjou
but
come
quick
let
us
get
rid
of
our
money
thereupon
he
disappeared
with
his
companion
laughing
and
talking
whilst
all
heads
were
bowed
on
his
passage
then
whispered
the
prince
to
athos
that
is
the
secret
it
was
not
i
who
told
you
so
my
lord
he
is
to
marry
the
sister
of
charles
i
believe
so
the
prince
reflected
for
a
moment
and
his
eye
shot
forth
one
of
its
not
infrequent
flashes
humph
said
he
slowly
as
if
speaking
to
himself
our
swords
are
once
more
to
be
hung
on
the
wall
for
a
long
time
and
he
sighed
all
that
sigh
contained
of
ambition
silently
stifled
of
extinguished
illusions
and
disappointed
hopes
athos
alone
divined
for
he
alone
heard
that
sigh
immediately
after
the
prince
took
leave
and
the
king
left
the
apartment
athos
by
a
sign
made
to
bragelonne
renewed
the
desire
he
had
expressed
at
the
beginning
of
the
scene
by
degrees
the
chamber
was
deserted
and
mazarin
was
left
alone
a
prey
to
suffering
which
he
could
no
longer
dissemble
bernouin
bernouin
cried
he
in
a
broken
voice
what
does
monseigneur
want
guenaud
let
guenaud
be
sent
for
said
his
eminence
i
think
i
m
dying
bernouin
in
great
terror
rushed
into
the
cabinet
to
give
the
order
and
the
piqueur
who
hastened
to
fetch
the
physician
passed
the
king
s
carriage
in
the
rue
saint
honore
chapter
xliii
guenaud
the
cardinal
s
order
was
pressing
guenaud
quickly
obeyed
it
he
found
his
patient
stretched
on
his
bed
his
legs
swelled
his
face
livid
and
his
stomach
collapsed
mazarin
had
a
severe
attack
of
gout
he
suffered
tortures
with
the
impatience
of
a
man
who
has
not
been
accustomed
to
resistances
on
seeing
guenaud
ah
said
he
now
i
am
saved
guenaud
was
a
very
learned
and
circumspect
man
who
stood
in
no
need
of
the
critiques
of
boileau
to
obtain
a
reputation
when
facing
a
disease
if
it
were
personified
in
a
king
he
treated
the
patient
as
a
turk
treats
a
moor
he
did
not
therefore
reply
to
mazarin
as
the
minister
expected
here
is
the
doctor
disease
on
the
contrary
on
examining
his
patient
with
a
very
serious
air
oh
oh
said
he
eh
what
guenaud
how
you
look
at
me
i
look
as
i
should
on
seeing
your
complaint
my
lord
it
is
a
very
dangerous
one
the
gout
oh
yes
the
gout
with
complications
my
lord
mazarin
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
and
questioning
by
look
and
gesture
what
do
you
mean
by
that
am
i
worse
than
i
believe
myself
to
be
my
lord
said
guenaud
seating
himself
beside
the
bed
your
eminence
has
worked
very
hard
during
your
life
your
eminence
has
suffered
much
but
i
am
not
old
i
fancy
the
late
de
richelieu
was
but
seventeen
months
younger
than
i
am
when
he
died
and
died
of
a
mortal
disease
i
am
young
guenaud
remember
i
am
scarcely
oh
my
lord
you
are
much
more
than
that
how
long
did
the
fronde
last
for
what
purpose
do
you
put
such
a
question
to
me
for
a
medical
calculation
monseigneur
well
some
ten
years
off
and
on
very
well
be
kind
enough
to
reckon
every
year
of
the
fronde
as
three
years
that
makes
thirty
now
twenty
and
makes
years
you
are
my
lord
and
that
is
a
great
age
whilst
saying
this
he
felt
the
pulse
of
his
patient
this
pulse
was
full
of
such
fatal
indications
that
the
physician
continued
notwithstanding
the
interruptions
of
the
patient
put
down
the
years
of
the
fronde
at
four
each
and
you
have
lived
years
are
you
speaking
seriously
guenaud
alas
yes
monseigneur
you
take
a
roundabout
way
then
to
inform
me
that
i
am
very
ill
ma
foi
yes
my
lord
and
with
a
man
of
the
mind
and
courage
of
your
eminence
it
ought
not
to
be
necessary
to
do
so
the
cardinal
breathed
with
such
difficulty
that
he
inspired
pity
even
in
a
pitiless
physician
there
are
diseases
and
diseases
resumed
mazarin
from
some
of
them
people
escape
that
is
true
my
lord
is
it
not
cried
mazarin
almost
joyously
for
in
short
what
else
would
be
the
use
of
power
of
strength
of
will
what
would
the
use
of
genius
be
your
genius
guenaud
what
would
be
the
use
of
science
and
art
if
the
patient
who
disposes
of
all
that
can
not
be
saved
from
peril
guenaud
was
about
to
open
his
mouth
but
mazarin
continued
remember
said
he
i
am
the
most
confiding
of
your
patients
remember
i
obey
you
blindly
and
that
consequently
i
know
all
that
said
guenaud
i
shall
be
cured
then
monseigneur
there
is
neither
strength
of
will
nor
power
nor
genius
nor
science
that
can
resist
a
disease
which
god
doubtless
sends
or
which
he
cast
upon
the
earth
at
the
creation
with
full
power
to
destroy
and
kill
mankind
when
the
disease
is
mortal
and
nothing
can
is
my
disease
mortal
asked
mazarin
yes
my
lord
his
eminence
sank
down
for
a
moment
like
an
unfortunate
wretch
who
is
crushed
by
a
falling
column
but
the
spirit
of
mazarin
was
a
strong
one
or
rather
his
mind
was
a
firm
one
guenaud
said
he
recovering
from
his
first
shock
you
will
permit
me
to
appeal
from
your
judgment
i
will
call
together
the
most
learned
men
of
europe
i
will
consult
them
i
will
live
in
short
by
the
virtue
of
i
care
not
what
remedy
my
lord
must
not
suppose
said
guenaud
that
i
have
the
presumption
to
pronounce
alone
upon
an
existence
so
valuable
as
yours
i
have
already
assembled
all
the
good
physicians
and
practitioners
of
france
and
europe
there
were
twelve
of
them
and
they
said
they
said
that
your
eminence
was
suffering
from
a
mortal
disease
i
have
the
consultation
signed
in
my
portfolio
if
your
eminence
will
please
to
see
it
you
will
find
the
names
of
all
the
incurable
diseases
we
have
met
with
there
is
first
no
no
cried
mazarin
pushing
away
the
paper
no
no
guenaud
i
yield
i
yield
and
a
profound
silence
during
which
the
cardinal
resumed
his
senses
and
recovered
his
strength
succeeded
to
the
agitation
of
this
scene
there
is
another
thing
murmured
mazarin
there
are
empirics
and
charlatans
in
my
country
those
whom
physicians
abandon
run
the
chance
of
a
quack
who
kills
them
ten
times
but
saves
them
a
hundred
times
has
not
your
eminence
observed
that
during
the
last
month
i
have
changed
my
remedies
ten
times
yes
well
well
i
have
spent
fifty
thousand
crowns
in
purchasing
the
secrets
of
all
these
fellows
the
list
is
exhausted
and
so
is
my
purse
you
are
not
cured
and
but
for
my
art
you
would
be
dead
that
ends
it
murmured
the
cardinal
that
ends
it
and
he
threw
a
melancholy
look
upon
the
riches
which
surrounded
him
and
must
i
quit
all
that
sighed
he
i
am
dying
guenaud
i
am
dying
oh
not
yet
my
lord
said
the
physician
mazarin
seized
his
hand
in
what
time
asked
he
fixing
his
two
large
eyes
upon
the
impassible
countenance
of
the
physician
my
lord
we
never
tell
that
to
ordinary
men
perhaps
not
but
to
me
to
me
whose
every
minute
is
worth
a
treasure
tell
me
guenaud
tell
me
no
no
my
lord
i
insist
upon
it
i
tell
you
oh
give
me
a
month
and
for
every
one
of
those
thirty
days
i
will
pay
you
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
my
lord
replied
guenaud
in
a
firm
voice
it
is
god
who
can
give
you
days
of
grace
and
not
i
god
only
allows
you
a
fortnight
the
cardinal
breathed
a
painful
sigh
and
sank
back
down
upon
his
pillow
murmuring
thank
you
guenaud
thank
you
the
physician
was
about
to
depart
the
dying
man
raising
himself
up
silence
said
he
with
flaming
eyes
silence
my
lord
i
have
known
this
secret
two
months
you
see
that
i
have
kept
it
faithfully
go
guenaud
i
will
take
care
of
your
fortunes
go
and
tell
brienne
to
send
me
a
clerk
called
colbert
go
chapter
xliv
colbert
colbert
was
not
far
off
during
the
whole
evening
he
had
remained
in
one
of
the
corridors
chatting
with
bernouin
and
brienne
and
commenting
with
the
ordinary
skill
of
people
of
court
upon
the
news
which
developed
like
upon
the
water
on
the
surface
of
each
event
it
is
doubtless
time
to
trace
in
a
few
words
one
of
the
most
interesting
portraits
of
the
age
and
to
trace
it
with
as
much
truth
perhaps
as
contemporary
painters
have
been
able
to
do
colbert
was
a
man
in
whom
the
historian
and
the
moralist
have
an
equal
right
he
was
thirteen
years
older
than
louis
his
future
master
of
middle
height
rather
lean
than
otherwise
he
had
eyes
a
mean
appearance
his
hair
was
coarse
black
and
thin
which
say
the
biographers
of
his
time
made
him
take
early
to
the
a
look
of
severity
of
harshness
even
a
sort
of
stiffness
which
with
inferiors
was
pride
with
superiors
an
affectation
of
superior
virtue
a
surly
cast
of
countenance
upon
all
occasions
even
when
looking
at
himself
in
a
glass
alone
such
is
the
exterior
of
his
personage
as
to
the
moral
part
of
his
character
the
depth
of
his
talent
for
accounts
and
his
ingenuity
in
making
sterility
itself
productive
were
much
boasted
of
colbert
had
formed
the
idea
of
forcing
governors
of
frontier
places
to
feed
the
garrisons
without
pay
with
what
they
drew
from
contributions
such
a
valuable
quality
made
mazarin
think
of
replacing
joubert
his
intendant
who
had
recently
died
by
colbert
who
had
such
skill
in
nibbling
down
allowances
colbert
by
degrees
crept
into
court
notwithstanding
his
lowly
birth
for
he
was
the
son
of
a
man
who
sold
wine
as
his
father
had
done
but
who
afterwards
sold
cloth
and
then
silk
stuffs
colbert
destined
for
trade
had
been
clerk
in
lyons
to
a
merchant
whom
he
had
quitted
to
come
to
paris
in
the
office
of
a
chatlet
procureur
named
biterne
it
was
here
he
learned
the
art
of
drawing
up
an
account
and
the
much
more
valuable
one
of
complicating
it
this
stiffness
of
manner
in
colbert
had
been
of
great
service
to
him
it
is
so
true
that
fortune
when
she
has
a
caprice
resembles
those
women
of
antiquity
who
when
they
had
a
fancy
were
disgusted
by
no
physical
or
moral
defects
in
either
men
or
things
colbert
placed
with
michel
letellier
secretary
of
state
in
by
his
cousin
colbert
seigneur
de
who
protected
him
received
one
day
from
the
minister
a
commission
for
cardinal
mazarin
his
eminence
was
then
in
the
enjoyment
of
flourishing
health
and
the
bad
years
of
the
fronde
had
not
yet
counted
triple
and
quadruple
for
him
he
was
at
sedan
very
much
annoyed
at
a
court
intrigue
in
which
anne
of
austria
seemed
inclined
to
desert
his
cause
of
this
intrigue
letellier
held
the
thread
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
anne
of
austria
a
letter
very
valuable
to
him
and
strongly
compromising
mazarin
but
as
he
already
played
the
double
part
which
served
him
so
well
and
by
which
he
always
managed
two
enemies
so
as
to
draw
advantage
from
both
either
by
embroiling
them
more
and
more
or
by
reconciling
them
michel
letellier
wished
to
send
anne
of
austria
s
letter
to
mazarin
in
order
that
he
might
be
acquainted
with
it
and
consequently
pleased
with
his
having
so
willingly
rendered
him
a
service
to
send
the
letter
was
an
easy
matter
to
recover
it
again
after
having
communicated
it
that
was
the
difficulty
letellier
cast
his
eyes
around
him
and
seeing
the
black
and
meager
clerk
with
the
scowling
brow
scribbling
away
in
his
office
he
preferred
him
to
the
best
gendarme
for
the
execution
of
this
design
colbert
was
commanded
to
set
out
for
sedan
with
positive
orders
to
carry
the
letter
to
mazarin
and
bring
it
back
to
letellier
he
listened
to
his
orders
with
scrupulous
attention
required
the
instructions
to
be
repeated
twice
and
was
particular
in
learning
whether
the
bringing
back
was
as
necessary
as
the
communicating
and
letellier
replied
sternly
more
necessary
then
he
set
out
traveled
like
a
courier
without
any
care
for
his
body
and
placed
in
the
hands
of
mazarin
first
a
letter
from
letellier
which
announced
to
the
cardinal
the
sending
of
the
precious
letter
and
then
that
letter
itself
mazarin
colored
greatly
whilst
reading
anne
of
austria
s
letter
gave
colbert
a
gracious
smile
and
dismissed
him
when
shall
i
have
the
answer
monseigneur
morning
yes
monsieur
the
clerk
turned
upon
his
heel
after
making
his
very
best
bow
the
next
day
he
was
at
his
post
at
seven
o
clock
mazarin
made
him
wait
till
ten
he
remained
patiently
in
the
his
turn
having
come
he
entered
mazarin
gave
him
a
sealed
packet
on
the
envelope
of
this
packet
were
these
words
monsieur
michel
letellier
etc
colbert
looked
at
the
packet
with
much
attention
the
cardinal
put
on
a
pleasant
countenance
and
pushed
him
towards
the
door
and
the
letter
of
the
my
lord
asked
colbert
it
is
in
with
the
rest
in
the
packet
said
mazarin
oh
very
well
replied
colbert
and
placing
his
hat
between
his
knees
he
began
to
unseal
the
packet
mazarin
uttered
a
cry
what
are
you
doing
said
he
angrily
i
am
unsealing
the
packet
my
lord
you
mistrust
me
then
master
pedant
do
you
did
any
one
ever
see
such
impertinence
oh
my
lord
do
not
be
angry
with
me
it
is
certainly
not
your
eminence
s
word
i
place
in
doubt
god
forbid
what
then
it
is
the
carefulness
of
your
chancery
my
lord
what
is
a
letter
a
rag
may
not
a
rag
be
forgotten
and
look
my
lord
look
if
i
was
not
right
your
clerks
have
forgotten
the
rag
the
letter
is
not
in
the
packet
you
are
an
insolent
fellow
and
you
have
not
looked
cried
mazarin
very
angrily
begone
and
wait
my
pleasure
whilst
saying
these
words
with
perfectly
italian
subtlety
he
snatched
the
packet
from
the
hands
of
colbert
and
his
apartments
but
this
anger
could
not
last
so
long
as
to
be
replaced
in
time
by
reason
mazarin
every
morning
on
opening
his
closet
door
found
the
figure
of
colbert
like
a
sentinel
behind
the
bench
and
this
disagreeable
figure
never
failed
to
ask
him
humbly
but
with
tenacity
for
the
s
letter
mazarin
could
hold
out
no
longer
and
was
obliged
to
give
it
up
he
accompanied
this
restitution
with
a
most
severe
reprimand
during
which
colbert
contented
himself
with
examining
feeling
even
smelling
as
it
were
the
paper
the
characters
and
the
signature
neither
more
nor
less
than
if
he
had
to
deal
with
the
greatest
forger
in
the
kingdom
mazarin
behaved
still
more
rudely
to
him
but
colbert
still
impassible
having
obtained
a
certainty
that
the
letter
was
the
true
one
went
off
as
if
he
had
been
deaf
this
conduct
obtained
for
him
afterwards
the
post
of
joubert
for
mazarin
instead
of
bearing
malice
admired
him
and
was
desirous
of
attaching
so
much
fidelity
to
himself
it
may
be
judged
by
this
single
anecdote
what
the
character
of
colbert
was
events
developing
themselves
by
degrees
allowed
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
to
act
freely
colbert
was
not
long
in
insinuating
himself
to
the
good
graces
of
the
cardinal
he
became
even
indispensable
to
him
the
clerk
was
acquainted
with
all
his
accounts
without
the
cardinal
s
ever
having
spoken
to
him
about
them
this
secret
between
them
was
a
powerful
tie
and
this
was
why
when
about
to
appear
before
the
master
of
another
world
mazarin
was
desirous
of
taking
good
counsel
in
disposing
the
wealth
he
was
so
unwillingly
obliged
to
leave
in
this
world
after
the
visit
of
guenaud
he
therefore
sent
for
colbert
desired
him
to
sit
down
and
said
to
him
let
us
converse
monsieur
colbert
and
seriously
for
i
am
very
ill
and
i
may
chance
to
die
man
is
mortal
replied
colbert
i
have
always
remembered
that
colbert
and
i
have
worked
with
that
end
in
view
you
know
that
i
have
amassed
a
little
wealth
i
know
you
have
monseigneur
at
how
much
do
you
estimate
as
near
as
you
can
the
amount
of
this
wealth
m
colbert
at
forty
millions
five
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
two
hundred
livres
nine
cents
eight
farthings
replied
colbert
the
cardinal
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
looked
at
colbert
with
wonder
but
he
allowed
a
smile
to
steal
across
his
lips
known
money
added
colbert
in
reply
to
that
smile
the
cardinal
gave
quite
a
start
in
bed
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
he
i
mean
said
colbert
that
besides
those
forty
millions
five
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
two
hundred
livres
nine
cents
eight
farthings
there
are
thirteen
millions
that
are
not
known
ouf
sighed
mazarin
what
a
man
at
this
moment
the
head
of
bernouin
appeared
through
the
embrasure
of
the
door
what
is
it
asked
mazarin
and
why
do
you
disturb
me
the
theatin
father
your
eminence
s
director
was
sent
for
this
evening
and
he
can
not
come
again
to
my
lord
till
after
mazarin
looked
a
colbert
who
rose
and
took
his
hat
saying
i
shall
come
again
my
lord
mazarin
hesitated
no
no
said
he
i
have
as
much
business
to
transact
with
you
as
with
him
besides
you
are
my
other
confessor
and
what
i
have
to
say
to
one
the
other
may
hear
remain
where
you
are
colbert
but
my
lord
if
there
be
no
secret
of
penitence
will
the
director
consent
to
my
being
here
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
come
into
the
ruelle
i
can
wait
outside
monseigneur
no
no
it
will
do
you
good
to
hear
the
confession
of
a
rich
man
colbert
bowed
and
went
into
the
ruelle
introduce
the
theatin
father
said
mazarin
closing
the
curtains
chapter
xlv
confession
of
a
man
of
wealth
the
theatin
entered
deliberately
without
being
too
much
astonished
at
the
noise
and
agitation
which
anxiety
for
the
cardinal
s
health
had
raised
in
his
household
come
in
my
reverend
father
said
mazarin
after
a
last
look
at
the
ruelle
come
in
and
console
me
that
is
my
duty
my
lord
replied
the
theatin
begin
by
sitting
down
and
making
yourself
comfortable
for
i
am
going
to
begin
with
a
general
confession
you
will
afterwards
give
me
a
good
absolution
and
i
shall
believe
myself
more
tranquil
my
lord
said
the
father
you
are
not
so
ill
as
to
make
a
general
confession
urgent
and
it
will
be
very
fatiguing
take
care
you
suspect
then
that
it
may
be
long
father
how
can
i
think
it
otherwise
when
a
man
has
lived
so
completely
as
your
eminence
has
done
ah
that
is
true
yes
the
recital
may
be
long
the
mercy
of
god
is
great
snuffled
the
theatin
stop
said
mazarin
there
i
begin
to
terrify
myself
with
having
allowed
so
many
things
to
pass
which
the
lord
might
reprove
is
that
not
always
so
said
the
theatin
naively
removing
further
from
the
lamp
his
thin
pointed
face
like
that
of
a
mole
sinners
are
so
forgetful
beforehand
and
scrupulous
when
it
is
too
late
sinners
replied
mazarin
do
you
use
that
word
ironically
and
to
reproach
me
with
all
the
genealogies
i
have
allowed
to
be
made
on
my
account
i
the
son
of
a
fisherman
in
fact
this
is
quite
untranslatable
it
being
a
play
upon
the
words
pecheur
with
a
grave
over
the
first
e
a
sinner
and
pecheur
with
an
accent
circumflex
over
the
first
e
a
fisherman
it
is
in
very
bad
trans
hum
said
the
theatin
that
is
a
first
sin
father
for
i
have
allowed
myself
made
to
descend
from
two
old
roman
consuls
geganius
macerinus
macerinus
and
proculus
macerinus
of
whom
the
chronicle
of
haolander
speaks
from
macerinus
to
mazarin
the
proximity
was
tempting
macerinus
a
diminutive
means
leanish
poorish
out
of
case
oh
reverend
father
mazarini
may
now
be
carried
to
the
augmentative
maigre
thin
as
lazarus
look
and
he
showed
his
fleshless
arms
in
your
having
been
born
of
a
family
of
fishermen
i
see
nothing
injurious
to
you
for
peter
was
a
fisherman
and
if
you
are
a
prince
of
the
church
my
lord
he
was
the
supreme
head
of
it
pass
on
if
you
please
so
much
the
more
for
my
having
threatened
with
the
bastile
a
certain
bounet
a
priest
of
avignon
who
wanted
to
publish
a
genealogy
of
the
casa
mazarini
much
too
marvelous
to
be
probable
replied
the
theatin
oh
if
i
had
acted
up
to
his
idea
father
that
would
have
been
the
vice
of
pride
another
sin
it
was
an
excess
of
wit
and
a
person
is
not
to
be
reproached
with
such
sorts
of
abuses
pass
on
pass
on
i
was
all
pride
look
you
father
i
will
endeavor
to
divide
that
into
capital
sins
i
like
divisions
when
well
made
i
am
glad
of
that
you
must
know
that
in
alas
that
is
years
ago
you
were
then
years
old
monseigneur
a
age
i
was
then
something
of
a
soldier
and
i
threw
myself
at
casal
into
the
arquebusades
to
show
that
i
rode
on
horseback
as
well
as
an
officer
it
is
true
i
restored
peace
between
the
french
and
the
spaniards
that
redeems
my
sin
a
little
i
see
no
sin
in
being
able
to
ride
well
on
horseback
said
the
theatin
that
is
in
perfect
good
taste
and
does
honor
to
our
gown
as
a
christian
i
approve
of
your
having
prevented
the
effusion
of
blood
as
a
monk
i
am
proud
of
the
bravery
a
monk
has
exhibited
mazarin
bowed
his
head
humbly
yes
said
he
but
the
consequences
what
consequences
eh
that
damned
sin
of
pride
has
roots
without
end
from
the
time
that
i
threw
myself
in
that
manner
between
two
armies
that
i
had
smelt
powder
and
faced
lines
of
soldiers
i
have
held
generals
a
little
in
contempt
ah
said
the
father
there
is
the
evil
so
that
i
have
not
found
one
endurable
since
that
time
the
fact
is
said
the
theatin
that
the
generals
we
have
had
have
not
been
remarkable
oh
cried
mazarin
there
was
monsieur
le
prince
i
have
tormented
him
thoroughly
he
is
not
much
to
be
pitied
he
has
acquired
sufficient
glory
and
sufficient
wealth
that
may
be
for
monsieur
le
prince
but
beaufort
for
example
whom
i
held
suffering
so
long
in
the
dungeon
of
vincennes
ah
but
he
was
a
rebel
and
the
safety
of
the
state
required
that
you
should
make
a
sacrifice
pass
on
i
believe
i
have
exhausted
pride
there
is
another
sin
which
i
am
afraid
to
qualify
i
can
qualify
it
myself
tell
it
a
great
sin
reverend
father
we
shall
judge
monseigneur
you
can
not
fail
to
have
heard
of
certain
relations
which
i
have
had
with
her
majesty
the
the
malevolent
the
malevolent
my
lord
are
fools
was
it
not
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
state
and
the
interests
of
the
young
king
that
you
should
live
in
good
intelligence
with
the
queen
pass
on
pass
on
i
assure
you
said
mazarin
you
remove
a
terrible
weight
from
my
breast
these
are
all
trifles
look
for
something
serious
i
have
had
much
ambition
father
that
is
the
march
of
great
minds
and
things
my
lord
even
the
longing
for
the
tiara
to
be
pope
is
to
be
the
first
of
christians
why
should
you
not
desire
that
it
has
been
printed
that
to
gain
that
object
i
had
sold
cambria
to
the
spaniards
you
have
perhaps
yourself
written
pamphlets
without
severely
persecuting
pamphleteers
then
reverend
father
i
have
truly
a
clean
breast
i
feel
nothing
remaining
but
slight
peccadilloes
what
are
they
play
that
is
rather
worldly
but
you
were
obliged
by
the
duties
of
greatness
to
keep
a
good
house
i
like
to
win
no
player
plays
to
lose
i
cheated
a
little
you
took
your
advantage
pass
on
well
reverend
father
i
feel
nothing
else
upon
my
conscience
give
me
absolution
and
my
soul
will
be
able
when
god
shall
please
to
call
it
to
mount
without
obstacle
to
the
throne
the
theatin
moved
neither
his
arms
nor
his
lips
what
are
you
waiting
for
father
said
mazarin
i
am
waiting
for
the
end
the
end
of
what
of
the
confession
monsieur
but
i
have
ended
oh
no
your
eminence
is
mistaken
not
that
i
know
of
search
diligently
i
have
searched
as
well
as
possible
then
i
shall
assist
your
memory
do
the
theatin
coughed
several
times
you
have
said
nothing
of
avarice
another
capital
sin
nor
of
those
millions
said
he
what
millions
father
why
those
you
possess
my
lord
father
that
money
is
mine
why
should
i
speak
to
you
about
that
because
you
see
our
opinions
differ
you
say
that
money
is
yours
whilst
i
i
believe
it
is
rather
the
property
of
others
mazarin
lifted
his
cold
hand
to
his
brow
which
was
beaded
with
perspiration
how
so
stammered
he
this
way
your
excellency
had
gained
much
wealth
in
the
service
of
the
king
hum
much
that
is
not
too
much
whatever
it
may
be
whence
came
that
wealth
from
the
state
the
state
that
is
the
king
but
what
do
you
conclude
from
that
father
said
mazarin
who
began
to
tremble
i
can
not
conclude
without
seeing
a
list
of
the
riches
you
possess
let
us
reckon
a
little
if
you
please
you
have
the
bishopric
of
metz
yes
the
abbeys
of
clement
arnould
and
vincent
all
at
metz
yes
you
have
the
abbey
of
denis
in
france
magnificent
property
yes
father
you
have
the
abbey
of
cluny
which
is
rich
i
have
that
of
medard
at
soissons
with
a
revenue
of
one
hundred
thousand
livres
i
can
not
deny
it
that
of
victor
at
marseilles
one
of
the
best
in
the
south
yes
father
a
good
million
a
year
with
the
emoluments
of
the
cardinalship
and
the
ministry
i
say
too
little
when
i
say
two
millions
a
year
eh
in
ten
years
that
is
twenty
millions
and
twenty
millions
put
out
at
fifty
per
cent
give
by
progression
millions
in
ten
years
how
well
you
reckon
for
a
theatin
since
your
eminence
placed
our
order
in
the
convent
we
occupy
near
germain
des
pres
in
i
have
kept
the
accounts
of
the
society
and
mine
likewise
apparently
father
one
ought
to
know
a
little
of
everything
my
lord
very
well
conclude
at
present
i
conclude
that
your
baggage
is
too
heavy
to
allow
you
to
pass
through
the
gates
of
paradise
shall
i
be
damned
if
you
do
not
make
restitution
yes
mazarin
uttered
a
piteous
cry
restitution
but
to
whom
good
god
to
the
owner
of
that
money
to
the
king
but
the
king
did
not
give
it
all
to
me
one
moment
does
not
the
king
sign
the
ordonances
mazarin
passed
from
sighs
to
groans
absolution
absolution
cried
he
impossible
my
lord
restitution
restitution
replied
the
theatin
but
you
absolve
me
from
all
other
sins
why
not
from
that
because
replied
the
father
to
absolve
you
for
that
motive
would
be
a
sin
for
which
the
king
would
never
absolve
me
my
lord
thereupon
the
confessor
quitted
his
penitent
with
an
air
full
of
compunction
he
then
went
out
in
the
same
manner
he
had
entered
oh
good
god
groaned
the
cardinal
come
here
colbert
i
am
very
very
ill
indeed
my
friend
chapter
xlvi
the
donation
colbert
reappeared
beneath
the
curtains
have
you
heard
said
mazarin
alas
yes
my
lord
can
he
be
right
can
all
this
money
be
badly
acquired
a
theatin
monseigneur
is
a
bad
judge
in
matters
of
finance
replied
colbert
coolly
and
yet
it
is
very
possible
that
according
to
his
theological
views
your
eminence
has
been
in
a
certain
degree
in
the
wrong
people
generally
find
they
have
been
so
when
they
die
in
the
first
place
they
commit
the
wrong
of
dying
colbert
that
is
true
my
lord
against
whom
however
did
the
theatin
make
out
that
you
had
committed
these
wrongs
against
the
king
mazarin
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
i
had
not
saved
both
his
state
and
his
finances
that
admits
of
no
contradiction
my
lord
does
it
then
i
have
received
a
merely
legitimate
salary
in
spite
of
the
opinion
of
my
confessor
that
is
beyond
doubt
and
i
might
fairly
keep
for
my
own
family
which
is
so
needy
a
good
fortune
the
whole
even
of
which
i
have
earned
i
see
no
impediment
to
that
monseigneur
i
felt
assured
that
in
consulting
you
colbert
i
should
have
good
advice
replied
mazarin
greatly
delighted
colbert
resumed
his
pedantic
look
my
lord
interrupted
he
i
think
it
would
be
quite
as
well
to
examine
whether
what
the
theatin
said
is
not
a
snare
oh
no
a
snare
what
for
the
theatin
is
an
honest
man
he
believed
your
eminence
to
be
at
death
s
door
because
your
eminence
consulted
him
did
i
not
hear
him
say
distinguish
that
which
the
king
has
given
you
from
that
which
you
have
given
recollect
my
lord
if
he
did
not
say
something
a
little
like
that
to
you
that
is
quite
a
theatrical
speech
that
is
possible
in
which
case
my
lord
i
should
consider
you
as
required
by
the
theatin
to
to
make
restitution
cried
mazarin
with
great
warmth
eh
i
do
not
say
no
what
of
all
you
do
not
dream
of
such
a
thing
you
speak
just
as
the
confessor
did
to
make
restitution
of
a
part
that
is
to
say
his
majesty
s
part
and
that
monseigneur
may
have
its
dangers
your
eminence
is
too
skillful
a
politician
not
to
know
that
at
this
moment
the
king
does
not
possess
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
livres
clear
in
his
coffers
that
is
not
my
affair
said
mazarin
triumphantly
that
belongs
to
le
surintendant
fouquet
whose
accounts
i
gave
you
to
verify
some
months
ago
colbert
bit
his
lips
at
the
name
of
fouquet
his
majesty
said
he
between
his
teeth
has
no
money
but
that
which
fouquet
collects
your
money
monseigneur
would
afford
him
a
delicious
banquet
well
but
i
am
not
the
superintendent
of
his
majesty
s
finances
i
have
my
purse
surely
i
would
do
much
for
his
majesty
s
welfare
some
legacy
but
i
can
not
disappoint
my
family
the
legacy
of
a
part
would
dishonor
you
and
offend
the
king
leaving
a
part
to
his
majesty
is
to
avow
that
that
part
has
inspired
you
with
doubts
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
the
means
of
acquisition
monsieur
colbert
i
thought
your
eminence
did
me
the
honor
to
ask
my
advice
yes
but
you
are
ignorant
of
the
principal
details
of
the
question
i
am
ignorant
of
nothing
my
lord
during
ten
years
all
the
columns
of
figures
which
are
found
in
france
have
passed
into
review
before
me
and
if
i
have
painfully
nailed
them
into
my
brain
they
are
there
now
so
well
riveted
that
from
the
office
of
letellier
who
is
sober
to
the
little
secret
largesses
of
fouquet
who
is
prodigal
i
could
recite
figure
by
figure
all
the
money
that
is
spent
in
france
from
marseilles
to
cherbourg
then
you
would
have
me
throw
all
my
money
into
the
coffers
of
the
king
cried
mazarin
ironically
and
from
whom
at
the
same
time
the
gout
forced
painful
moans
surely
the
king
would
reproach
me
with
nothing
but
he
would
laugh
at
me
while
squandering
my
millions
and
with
good
reason
your
eminence
has
misunderstood
me
i
did
not
the
least
in
the
world
pretend
that
his
majesty
ought
to
spend
your
money
you
said
so
clearly
it
seems
to
me
when
you
advised
me
to
give
it
to
him
ah
replied
colbert
that
is
because
your
eminence
absorbed
as
you
are
by
your
disease
entirely
loses
sight
of
the
character
of
louis
xiv
how
so
that
character
if
i
may
venture
to
express
myself
thus
resembles
that
which
my
lord
confessed
just
now
to
the
theatin
go
on
that
is
pride
pardon
me
my
lord
haughtiness
nobleness
kings
have
no
pride
that
is
a
human
passion
pride
yes
you
are
right
next
well
my
lord
if
i
have
divined
rightly
your
eminence
has
but
to
give
all
your
money
to
the
king
and
that
immediately
but
for
what
said
mazarin
quite
bewildered
because
the
king
will
not
accept
of
the
whole
what
and
he
a
young
man
and
devoured
by
ambition
just
so
a
young
man
who
is
anxious
for
my
death
my
lord
to
inherit
yes
colbert
yes
he
is
anxious
for
my
death
in
order
to
inherit
triple
fool
that
i
am
i
would
prevent
him
exactly
if
the
donation
were
made
in
a
certain
form
he
would
refuse
it
well
but
how
that
is
plain
enough
a
young
man
who
has
yet
done
nothing
who
burns
to
distinguish
himself
who
burns
to
reign
alone
will
never
take
anything
ready
built
he
will
construct
for
himself
this
prince
monseigneur
will
never
be
content
with
the
palais
royal
which
de
richelieu
left
him
nor
with
the
palais
mazarin
which
you
have
had
so
superbly
constructed
nor
with
the
louvre
which
his
ancestors
inhabited
nor
with
germain
where
he
was
born
all
that
does
not
proceed
from
himself
i
predict
he
will
disdain
and
you
will
guarantee
that
if
i
give
my
forty
millions
to
the
king
saying
certain
things
to
him
at
the
same
time
i
guarantee
he
will
refuse
them
but
those
things
what
are
they
i
will
write
them
if
my
lord
will
have
the
goodness
to
dictate
them
well
but
after
all
what
advantage
will
that
be
to
me
an
enormous
one
nobody
will
afterwards
be
able
to
accuse
your
eminence
of
that
unjust
avarice
with
which
pamphleteers
have
reproached
the
most
brilliant
mind
of
the
present
age
you
are
right
colbert
you
are
right
go
and
seek
the
king
on
my
part
and
take
him
my
will
your
donation
my
lord
but
if
he
should
accept
it
if
he
should
even
think
of
accepting
it
then
there
would
remain
thirteen
millions
for
your
family
and
that
is
a
good
round
sum
but
then
you
would
be
either
a
fool
or
a
traitor
and
i
am
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
my
lord
you
appear
to
be
much
afraid
that
the
king
will
accept
you
have
a
deal
more
reason
to
fear
that
he
will
not
accept
but
see
you
if
he
does
not
accept
i
should
like
to
guarantee
my
thirteen
reserved
millions
to
him
yes
i
will
do
so
yes
but
my
pains
are
returning
i
shall
faint
i
am
very
very
ill
colbert
i
am
near
my
end
colbert
started
the
cardinal
was
indeed
very
ill
large
drops
of
sweat
flowed
down
upon
his
bed
of
agony
and
the
frightful
pallor
of
a
face
streaming
with
water
was
a
spectacle
which
the
most
hardened
practitioner
could
not
have
beheld
without
much
compassion
colbert
was
without
doubt
very
much
affected
for
he
quitted
the
chamber
calling
bernouin
to
attend
to
the
dying
man
and
went
into
the
corridor
there
walking
about
with
a
meditative
expression
which
almost
gave
nobility
to
his
vulgar
head
his
shoulders
thrown
up
his
neck
stretched
out
his
lips
half
open
to
give
vent
to
unconnected
fragments
of
incoherent
thoughts
he
lashed
up
his
courage
to
the
pitch
of
the
undertaking
contemplated
whilst
within
ten
paces
of
him
separated
only
by
a
wall
his
master
was
being
stifled
by
anguish
which
drew
from
him
lamentable
cries
thinking
no
more
of
the
treasures
of
the
earth
or
of
the
joys
of
paradise
but
much
of
all
the
horrors
of
hell
whilst
napkins
physic
revulsives
and
guenaud
who
was
recalled
were
performing
their
functions
with
increased
activity
colbert
holding
his
great
head
in
both
his
hands
to
compress
within
it
the
fever
of
the
projects
engendered
by
the
brain
was
meditating
the
tenor
of
the
donation
he
would
make
mazarin
write
at
the
first
hour
of
respite
his
disease
should
afford
him
it
would
appear
as
if
all
the
cries
of
the
cardinal
and
all
the
attacks
of
death
upon
this
representative
of
the
past
were
stimulants
for
the
genius
of
this
thinker
with
the
bushy
eyebrows
who
was
turning
already
towards
the
rising
sun
of
a
regenerated
society
colbert
resumed
his
place
at
mazarin
s
pillow
at
the
first
interval
of
pain
and
persuaded
him
to
dictate
a
donation
thus
conceived
about
to
appear
before
god
the
master
of
mankind
i
beg
the
king
who
was
my
master
on
earth
to
resume
the
wealth
which
his
bounty
has
bestowed
upon
me
and
which
my
family
would
be
happy
to
see
pass
into
such
illustrious
hands
the
particulars
of
my
property
will
be
found
they
are
drawn
up
at
the
first
requisition
of
his
majesty
or
at
the
last
sigh
of
his
most
devoted
servant
jules
cardinal
de
mazarin
the
cardinal
sighed
heavily
as
he
signed
this
colbert
sealed
the
packet
and
carried
it
immediately
to
the
louvre
whither
the
king
had
returned
he
then
went
back
to
his
own
home
rubbing
his
hands
with
the
confidence
of
workman
who
has
done

chapter
xlvii
how
anne
of
austria
gave
one
piece
of
advice
to
louis
xiv
the
news
of
the
extreme
illness
of
the
cardinal
had
already
spread
and
attracted
at
least
as
much
attention
among
the
people
of
the
louvre
as
the
news
of
the
marriage
of
monsieur
the
king
s
brother
which
had
already
been
announced
as
an
official
fact
scarcely
had
louis
xiv
returned
home
with
his
thoughts
fully
occupied
with
the
various
things
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
the
course
of
the
evening
when
an
usher
announced
that
the
same
crowd
of
courtiers
who
in
the
morning
had
thronged
his
lever
presented
themselves
again
at
his
coucher
a
remarkable
piece
of
respect
which
during
the
reign
of
the
cardinal
the
court
not
very
discreet
in
its
performance
had
accorded
to
the
minister
without
caring
about
displeasing
the
king
but
the
minister
had
had
as
we
have
said
an
alarming
attack
of
gout
and
the
tide
of
flattery
was
mounting
towards
the
throne
courtiers
have
a
marvelous
instinct
in
scenting
the
turn
of
events
courtiers
possess
a
supreme
kind
of
science
they
are
diplomatists
in
throwing
light
upon
the
unraveling
of
complicated
intrigues
captains
in
divining
the
issue
of
battles
and
physicians
in
curing
the
sick
louis
to
whom
his
mother
had
taught
this
axiom
together
with
many
others
understood
at
once
that
the
cardinal
must
be
very
scarcely
had
anne
of
austria
conducted
the
young
queen
to
her
apartments
and
taken
from
her
brow
the
of
ceremony
when
she
went
to
see
her
son
in
his
cabinet
where
alone
melancholy
and
depressed
he
was
indulging
as
if
to
exercise
his
will
in
one
of
those
terrible
inward
passions
king
s
passions
which
create
events
when
they
break
out
and
with
louis
thanks
to
his
astonishing
command
over
himself
became
such
benign
tempests
that
his
most
violent
his
only
passion
that
which
saint
simon
mentions
with
astonishment
was
that
famous
fit
of
anger
which
he
exhibited
fifty
years
later
on
the
occasion
of
a
little
concealment
of
the
duc
de
maine
s
and
which
had
for
result
a
shower
of
blows
inflicted
with
a
cane
upon
the
back
of
a
poor
valet
who
had
stolen
a
biscuit
the
young
king
then
was
as
we
have
seen
a
prey
to
a
double
excitement
and
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
in
a
glass
o
king
king
by
name
and
not
in
fact
phantom
vain
phantom
art
thou
inert
statue
which
has
no
other
power
than
that
of
provoking
salutations
from
courtiers
when
wilt
thou
be
able
to
raise
thy
velvet
arm
or
clench
thy
silken
hand
when
wilt
thou
be
able
to
open
for
any
purpose
but
to
sigh
or
smile
lips
condemned
to
the
motionless
stupidity
of
the
marbles
in
thy
gallery
then
passing
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
feeling
the
want
of
air
he
approached
a
window
and
looking
down
saw
below
some
horsemen
talking
together
and
groups
of
timid
observers
these
horsemen
were
a
fraction
of
the
watch
the
groups
were
busy
portions
of
the
people
to
whom
a
king
is
always
a
curious
thing
the
same
as
a
rhinoceros
a
crocodile
or
a
serpent
he
struck
his
brow
with
his
open
hand
crying
king
of
france
what
a
title
people
of
france
what
a
heap
of
creatures
i
have
just
returned
to
my
louvre
my
horses
just
unharnessed
are
still
smoking
and
i
have
created
interest
enough
to
induce
scarcely
twenty
persons
to
look
at
me
as
i
passed
twenty
what
do
i
say
no
there
were
not
twenty
anxious
to
see
the
king
of
france
there
are
not
even
ten
archers
to
guard
my
palace
of
residence
archers
people
guards
all
are
at
the
palais
royal
why
my
good
god
have
not
i
the
king
the
right
to
ask
of
you
all
that
because
said
a
voice
replying
to
his
and
which
sounded
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
of
the
cabinet
because
at
the
palais
royal
lies
all
the
gold
that
is
to
say
all
the
power
of
him
who
desires
to
reign
louis
turned
round
sharply
the
voice
which
had
pronounced
these
words
was
that
of
anne
of
austria
the
king
started
and
advanced
towards
her
i
hope
said
he
your
majesty
has
paid
no
attention
to
the
vain
declamations
which
the
solitude
and
disgust
familiar
to
kings
suggest
to
the
happiest
dispositions
i
only
paid
attention
to
one
thing
my
son
and
that
was
that
you
were
complaining
who
i
not
at
all
said
louis
xiv
no
in
truth
you
err
madame
what
were
you
doing
then
i
thought
i
was
under
the
ferule
of
my
professor
and
developing
a
subject
of
amplification
my
son
replied
anne
of
austria
shaking
her
head
you
are
wrong
not
to
trust
my
word
you
are
wrong
not
to
grant
me
your
confidence
a
day
will
come
and
perhaps
quickly
wherein
you
will
have
occasion
to
remember
that
axiom
gold
is
universal
power
and
they
alone
are
kings
who
are
your
intention
continued
the
king
was
not
however
to
cast
blame
upon
the
rich
men
of
this
age
was
it
no
said
the
queen
warmly
no
sire
they
who
are
rich
in
this
age
under
your
reign
are
rich
because
you
have
been
willing
they
should
be
so
and
i
entertain
against
them
neither
malice
nor
envy
they
have
without
doubt
served
your
majesty
sufficiently
well
for
your
majesty
to
have
permitted
them
to
reward
themselves
that
is
what
i
mean
to
say
by
the
words
for
which
you
reproach
me
god
forbid
madame
that
i
should
ever
reproach
my
mother
with
anything
besides
continued
anne
of
austria
the
lord
never
gives
the
goods
of
this
world
but
for
a
season
the
lord
as
correctives
to
honor
and
riches
the
lord
has
placed
sufferings
sickness
and
death
and
no
one
added
she
with
a
melancholy
smile
which
proved
she
made
the
application
of
the
funeral
precept
to
herself
no
man
can
take
his
wealth
or
greatness
with
him
to
the
grave
it
results
therefore
that
the
young
gather
the
abundant
harvest
prepared
for
them
by
the
old
louis
listened
with
increased
attention
to
the
words
which
anne
of
austria
no
doubt
pronounced
with
a
view
to
console
him
madame
said
he
looking
earnestly
at
his
mother
one
would
almost
say
in
truth
that
you
had
something
else
to
announce
to
me
i
have
absolutely
nothing
my
son
only
you
can
not
have
failed
to
remark
that
his
eminence
the
cardinal
is
very
louis
looked
at
his
mother
expecting
some
emotion
in
her
voice
some
sorrow
in
her
countenance
the
face
of
anne
of
austria
appeared
a
little
changed
but
that
was
from
sufferings
of
quite
a
personal
character
perhaps
the
alteration
was
caused
by
the
cancer
which
had
begun
to
consume
her
breast
yes
madame
said
the
king
yes
de
mazarin
is
very
and
it
would
be
a
great
loss
to
the
kingdom
if
god
were
to
summon
his
eminence
away
is
not
that
your
opinion
as
well
as
mine
my
son
said
the
queen
yes
madame
yes
certainly
it
would
be
a
great
loss
for
the
kingdom
said
louis
coloring
but
the
peril
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
so
great
besides
the
cardinal
is
still
young
the
king
had
scarcely
ceased
speaking
when
an
usher
lifted
the
tapestry
and
stood
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
waiting
for
the
king
to
speak
to
him
what
have
you
there
asked
the
king
a
message
from
de
mazarin
replied
the
usher
give
it
to
me
said
the
king
and
he
took
the
paper
but
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
open
it
there
was
a
great
noise
in
the
gallery
the
and
the
court
ah
ah
said
louis
who
doubtless
knew
the
meaning
of
that
triple
noise
how
could
i
say
there
was
but
one
king
in
france
i
was
mistaken
there
are
two
as
he
spoke
or
thought
thus
the
door
opened
and
the
superintendent
of
finances
fouquet
appeared
before
his
nominal
master
it
was
he
who
made
the
noise
in
the
it
was
his
horse
that
made
the
noise
in
the
courtyard
in
addition
to
all
this
a
loud
murmur
was
heard
along
his
passage
which
did
not
die
away
till
some
time
after
he
had
passed
it
was
this
murmur
which
louis
xiv
regretted
so
deeply
not
hearing
as
he
passed
and
dying
away
behind
him
he
is
not
precisely
a
king
as
you
fancy
said
anne
of
austria
to
her
son
he
is
only
a
man
who
is
much
too
rich
that
is
all
whilst
saying
these
words
a
bitter
feeling
gave
to
these
words
of
the
queen
a
most
hateful
expression
whereas
the
brow
of
the
king
calm
and
on
the
contrary
was
without
the
slightest
wrinkle
he
nodded
therefore
familiarly
to
fouquet
whilst
he
continued
to
unfold
the
paper
given
to
him
by
the
usher
fouquet
perceived
this
movement
and
with
a
politeness
at
once
easy
and
respectful
advanced
towards
the
queen
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
king
louis
had
opened
the
paper
and
yet
he
did
not
read
it
he
listened
to
fouquet
paying
the
most
charming
compliments
to
the
queen
upon
her
hand
and
arm
anne
of
austria
s
frown
relaxed
a
little
she
even
almost
smiled
fouquet
perceived
that
the
king
instead
of
reading
was
looking
at
him
he
turned
half
round
therefore
and
while
continuing
his
conversation
with
the
queen
faced
the
king
you
know
monsieur
fouquet
said
louis
how
ill
mazarin
is
yes
sire
i
know
that
said
fouquet
in
fact
he
is
very
ill
i
was
at
my
of
vaux
when
the
news
reached
me
and
the
affair
seemed
so
pressing
that
i
left
at
once
you
left
vaux
this
evening
monsieur
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
yes
your
majesty
said
fouquet
consulting
a
watch
richly
ornamented
with
diamonds
an
hour
and
a
half
said
the
king
still
able
to
restrain
his
anger
but
not
to
conceal
his
astonishment
i
understand
you
sire
your
majesty
doubts
my
word
and
you
have
reason
to
do
so
but
i
have
really
come
in
that
time
though
it
is
wonderful
i
received
from
england
three
pairs
of
very
fast
horses
as
i
had
been
assured
they
were
placed
at
distances
of
four
leagues
apart
and
i
tried
them
this
evening
they
really
brought
me
from
vaux
to
the
louvre
in
an
hour
and
a
half
so
your
majesty
sees
i
have
not
been
cheated
the
smiled
with
something
like
secret
envy
but
fouquet
caught
her
thought
thus
madame
he
promptly
said
such
horses
are
made
for
kings
not
for
subjects
for
kings
ought
never
to
yield
to
any
one
in
anything
the
king
looked
up
and
yet
interrupted
anne
of
austria
you
are
not
a
king
that
i
know
of
m
fouquet
truly
not
madame
therefore
the
horses
only
await
the
orders
of
his
majesty
to
enter
the
royal
stables
and
if
i
allowed
myself
to
try
them
it
was
only
for
fear
of
offering
to
the
king
anything
that
was
not
positively
wonderful
the
king
became
quite
red
you
know
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
queen
that
at
the
court
of
france
it
is
not
the
custom
for
a
subject
to
offer
anything
to
his
king
louis
started
i
hoped
madame
said
fouquet
much
agitated
that
my
love
for
his
majesty
my
incessant
desire
to
please
him
would
serve
to
compensate
the
want
of
etiquette
it
was
not
so
much
a
present
that
i
permitted
myself
to
offer
as
the
tribute
i
paid
thank
you
monsieur
fouquet
said
the
king
politely
and
i
am
gratified
by
your
intention
for
i
love
good
horses
but
you
know
i
am
not
very
rich
you
who
are
my
superintendent
of
finances
know
it
better
than
any
one
else
i
am
not
able
then
however
willing
i
may
be
to
purchase
such
a
valuable
set
of
horses
fouquet
darted
a
haughty
glance
at
the
who
appeared
to
triumph
at
the
false
position
in
which
the
minister
had
placed
himself
and
replied
luxury
is
the
virtue
of
kings
sire
it
is
luxury
which
makes
them
resemble
god
it
is
by
luxury
they
are
more
than
other
men
with
luxury
a
king
nourishes
his
subjects
and
honors
them
under
the
mild
heat
of
this
luxury
of
kings
springs
the
luxury
of
individuals
a
source
of
riches
for
the
people
his
majesty
by
accepting
the
gift
of
these
six
incomparable
horses
would
stimulate
the
pride
of
his
own
breeders
of
limousin
perche
and
normandy
and
this
emulation
would
have
been
beneficial
to
all
but
the
king
is
silent
and
consequently
i
am
condemned
during
this
speech
louis
was
unconsciously
folding
and
unfolding
mazarin
s
paper
upon
which
he
had
not
cast
his
eyes
at
length
he
glanced
upon
it
and
uttered
a
faint
cry
at
reading
the
first
line
what
is
the
matter
my
son
asked
the
queen
anxiously
and
going
towards
the
king
from
the
cardinal
replied
the
king
continuing
to
read
yes
yes
it
is
really
from
him
is
he
worse
then
read
said
the
king
passing
the
parchment
to
his
mother
as
if
he
thought
that
nothing
less
than
reading
would
convince
anne
of
austria
of
a
thing
so
astonishing
as
was
conveyed
in
that
paper
anne
of
austria
read
in
turn
and
as
she
read
her
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
all
the
greater
from
her
useless
endeavor
to
hide
it
which
attracted
the
attention
of
fouquet
oh
a
regularly
drawn
up
deed
of
gift
said
she
a
gift
repeated
fouquet
yes
said
the
king
replying
pointedly
to
the
superintendent
of
finances
yes
at
the
point
of
death
monsieur
le
cardinal
makes
me
a
donation
of
all
his
wealth
forty
millions
cried
the
queen
oh
my
son
this
is
very
noble
on
the
part
of
his
eminence
and
will
silence
all
malicious
rumors
forty
millions
scraped
together
slowly
coming
back
all
in
one
heap
to
the
treasury
it
is
the
act
of
a
faithful
subject
and
a
good
christian
and
having
once
more
cast
her
eyes
over
the
act
she
restored
it
to
louis
whom
the
announcement
of
the
sum
greatly
agitated
fouquet
had
taken
some
steps
backwards
and
remained
silent
the
king
looked
at
him
and
held
the
paper
out
to
him
in
turn
the
superintendent
only
bestowed
a
haughty
look
of
a
second
upon
it
then
bowing
yes
sire
said
he
a
donation
i
see
you
must
reply
to
it
my
son
said
anne
of
austria
you
must
reply
to
it
and
immediately
but
how
madame
by
a
visit
to
the
cardinal
why
it
is
but
an
hour
since
i
left
his
eminence
said
the
king
write
then
sire
write
said
the
young
king
with
evident
repugnance
well
replied
anne
of
austria
it
seems
to
me
my
son
that
a
man
who
has
just
made
such
a
present
has
a
good
right
to
expect
to
be
thanked
for
it
with
some
degree
of
promptitude
then
turning
towards
fouquet
is
not
that
likewise
your
opinion
monsieur
that
the
present
is
worth
the
trouble
yes
madame
said
fouquet
with
a
lofty
air
that
did
not
escape
the
king
accept
then
and
thank
him
insisted
anne
of
austria
what
says
m
fouquet
asked
louis
xiv
does
your
majesty
wish
to
know
my
opinion
yes
thank
him
sire
ah
said
the
queen
but
do
not
accept
continued
fouquet
and
why
not
asked
the
queen
you
have
yourself
said
why
madame
replied
fouquet
because
kings
can
not
and
ought
not
to
receive
presents
from
their
subjects
the
king
remained
silent
between
these
two
contrary
opinions
but
forty
millions
said
anne
of
austria
in
the
same
tone
as
that
in
which
at
a
later
period
poor
marie
antoinette
replied
you
will
tell
me
as
much

said
fouquet
laughing
forty
millions
makes
a
good
round
sum
such
a
sum
as
could
almost
tempt
a
royal
conscience
but
monsieur
said
anne
of
austria
instead
of
persuading
the
king
not
to
receive
this
present
recall
to
his
majesty
s
mind
you
whose
duty
it
is
that
these
forty
millions
are
a
fortune
to
him
it
is
precisely
madame
because
these
forty
millions
would
be
a
fortune
that
i
will
say
to
the
king
sire
if
it
be
not
decent
for
a
king
to
accept
from
a
subject
six
horses
worth
twenty
thousand
livres
it
would
be
disgraceful
for
him
to
owe
a
fortune
to
another
subject
more
or
less
scrupulous
in
the
choice
of
the
materials
which
contributed
to
the
building
up
of
that
it
ill
becomes
you
monsieur
to
give
your
king
a
lesson
said
anne
of
austria
better
procure
for
him
forty
millions
to
replace
those
you
make
him
lose
the
king
shall
have
them
whenever
he
wishes
said
the
superintendent
of
finances
bowing
yes
by
oppressing
the
people
said
the
queen
and
were
they
not
oppressed
madame
replied
fouquet
when
they
were
made
to
sweat
the
forty
millions
given
by
this
deed
furthermore
his
majesty
has
asked
my
opinion
i
have
given
it
if
his
majesty
ask
my
concurrence
it
will
be
the
same
nonsense
accept
my
son
accept
said
anne
of

you
are
above
reports
and
interpretations
refuse
sire
said
fouquet
as
long
as
a
king
lives
he
has
no
other
measure
but
his
conscience
no
other
judge
than
his
own
desires
but
when
dead
he
has
posterity
which
applauds
or
accuses
thank
you

replied
louis
bowing
respectfully
to

you
monsieur

said
he
dismissing

chapter
xlviii
agony
the
day
that
the
deed
of
gift
had
been
sent
to
the
king
the
cardinal
caused
himself
to
be
transported
to
vincennes
the
king
and
the
court
followed
him
thither
the
last
flashes
of
this
torch
still
cast
splendor
enough
around
to
absorb
all
other
lights
in
its
rays
besides
as
it
has
been
seen
the
faithful
satellite
of
his
minister
young
louis
marched
to
the
last
minute
in
accordance
with
his
gravitation
the
disease
as
guenaud
had
predicted
had
become
worse
it
was
no
longer
an
attack
of
gout
it
was
an
attack
of
death
then
there
was
another
thing
which
made
that
agony
more
agonizing
still
and
that
was
the
agitation
brought
into
his
mind
by
the
donation
he
had
sent
to
the
king
and
which
according
to
colbert
the
king
ought
to
send
back
unaccepted
to
the
cardinal
the
cardinal
had
as
we
have
said
great
faith
in
the
predictions
of
his
secretary
but
the
sum
was
a
large
one
and
whatever
might
be
the
genius
of
colbert
from
time
to
time
the
cardinal
thought
to
himself
that
the
theatin
also
might
possibly
have
been
mistaken
and
there
was
at
least
as
much
chance
of
his
not
being
damned
as
there
was
of
louis
xiv
sending
back
his
millions
besides
the
longer
the
donation
was
in
coming
back
the
more
mazarin
thought
that
forty
millions
were
worth
a
little
risk
particularly
of
so
hypothetic
a
thing
as
the
soul
mazarin
in
his
character
of
cardinal
and
prime
minister
was
almost
an
atheist
and
quite
a
materialist
every
time
that
the
door
opened
he
turned
sharply
round
towards
that
door
expecting
to
see
the
return
of
his
unfortunate
donation
then
deceived
in
his
hope
he
fell
back
again
with
a
sigh
and
found
his
pains
so
much
the
greater
for
having
forgotten
them
for
an
instant
anne
of
austria
had
also
followed
the
cardinal
her
heart
though
age
had
made
it
selfish
could
not
help
evincing
towards
the
dying
man
a
sorrow
which
she
owed
him
as
a
wife
according
to
some
and
as
a
sovereign
according
to
others
she
had
in
some
sort
put
on
a
mourning
countenance
beforehand
and
all
the
court
wore
it
as
she
did
louis
in
order
not
to
show
on
his
face
what
was
passing
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
persisted
in
remaining
in
his
own
apartments
where
his
nurse
alone
kept
him
company
the
more
he
saw
the
approach
of
the
time
when
all
constraint
would
be
at
an
end
the
more
humble
and
patient
he
was
falling
back
upon
himself
as
all
strong
men
do
when
they
form
great
designs
in
order
to
gain
more
spring
at
the
decisive
moment
extreme
unction
had
been
administered
to
the
cardinal
who
faithful
to
his
habits
of
dissimulation
struggled
against
appearances
and
even
against
reality
receiving
company
in
his
bed
as
if
he
only
suffered
from
a
temporary
complaint
guenaud
on
his
part
preserved
profound
secrecy
wearied
with
visits
and
questions
he
answered
nothing
but
his
eminence
is
still
full
of
youth
and
strength
but
god
wills
that
which
he
wills
and
when
he
has
decided
that
man
is
to
be
laid
low
he
will
be
laid
low
these
words
which
he
scattered
with
a
sort
of
discretion
reserve
and
preference
were
commented
upon
earnestly
by
two
persons
the
king
and
the
cardinal
mazarin
notwithstanding
the
prophecy
of
guenaud
still
lured
himself
with
a
hope
or
rather
played
his
part
so
well
that
the
most
cunning
when
saying
that
he
lured
himself
proved
that
they
were
his
dupes
louis
absent
from
the
cardinal
for
two
days
louis
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that
same
donation
which
so
constantly
preoccupied
the
cardinal
louis
did
not
exactly
know
how
to
make
out
mazarin
s
conduct
the
son
of
louis
following
the
paternal
traditions
had
up
to
that
time
been
so
little
of
a
king
that
whilst
ardently
desiring
royalty
he
desired
it
with
that
terror
which
always
accompanies
the
unknown
thus
having
formed
his
resolution
which
besides
he
communicated
to
nobody
he
determined
to
have
an
interview
with
mazarin
it
was
anne
of
austria
who
constant
in
her
attendance
upon
the
cardinal
first
heard
this
proposition
of
the
king
s
and
transmitted
it
to
the
dying
man
whom
it
greatly
agitated
for
what
purpose
could
louis
wish
for
an
interview
was
it
to
return
the
deed
as
colbert
had
said
he
would
was
it
to
keep
it
after
thanking
him
as
mazarin
thought
he
would
nevertheless
as
the
dying
man
felt
that
the
uncertainty
increased
his
torments
he
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
his
majesty
will
be
welcome
yes
very
welcome
cried
he
making
a
sign
to
colbert
who
was
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
which
the
latter
understood
perfectly
madame
continued
mazarin
will
your
majesty
be
good
enough
to
assure
the
king
yourself
of
the
truth
of
what
i
have
just
said
anne
of
austria
rose
she
herself
was
anxious
to
have
the
question
of
the
forty
millions
settled
the
question
which
seemed
to
lie
heavy
on
the
mind
of
everyone
anne
of
austria
went
out
mazarin
made
a
great
effort
and
raising
himself
up
towards
colbert
well
colbert
said
he
two
days
have
passed
away
two
mortal
days
and
you
see
nothing
has
been
returned
from
yonder
patience
my
lord
said
colbert
are
you
mad
you
wretch
you
advise
me
to
have
patience
oh
in
sad
truth
colbert
you
are
laughing
at
me
i
am
dying
and
you
call
out
to
me
to
wait
my
lord
said
colbert
with
his
habitual
coolness
it
is
impossible
that
things
should
not
come
out
as
i
have
said
his
majesty
is
coming
to
see
you
and
no
doubt
he
brings
back
the
deed
himself
do
you
think
so
well
i
on
the
contrary
am
sure
that
his
majesty
is
coming
to
thank
me
at
this
moment
anne
of
austria
returned
on
her
way
to
the
apartments
of
her
son
she
had
met
with
a
new
empiric
this
was
a
powder
which
was
said
to
have
power
to
save
the
cardinal
and
she
brought
a
portion
of
this
powder
with
her
but
this
was
not
what
mazarin
expected
therefore
he
would
not
even
look
at
it
declaring
that
life
was
not
worth
the
pains
that
were
taken
to
preserve
it
but
whilst
professing
this
philosophical
axiom
his
secret
escaped
him
at
last
that
madame
said
he
that
is
not
the
interesting
part
of
my
situation
i
made
two
days
ago
a
little
donation
to
the
king
up
to
this
time
from
delicacy
no
doubt
his
majesty
has
not
condescended
to
say
anything
about
it
but
the
time
for
explanation
is
come
and
i
implore
your
majesty
to
tell
me
if
the
king
has
made
up
his
mind
on
that
matter
anne
of
austria
was
about
to
reply
when
mazarin
stopped
her
the
truth
madame
said
he
in
the
name
of
heaven
the
truth
do
not
flatter
a
dying
man
with
a
hope
that
may
prove
vain
there
he
stopped
a
look
from
colbert
telling
him
he
was
on
the
wrong
track
i
know
said
anne
of
austria
taking
the
cardinal
s
hand
i
know
that
you
have
generously
made
not
a
little
donation
as
you
modestly
call
it
but
a
magnificent
gift
i
know
how
painful
it
would
be
to
you
if
the
king
mazarin
listened
dying
as
he
was
as
ten
living
men
could
not
have
listened
if
the
king
replied
he
if
the
king
continued
anne
of
austria
should
not
freely
accept
what
you
offer
so
nobly
mazarin
allowed
himself
to
sink
back
upon
his
pillow
like
pantaloon
that
is
to
say
with
all
the
despair
of
a
man
who
bows
before
the
tempest
but
he
still
preserved
sufficient
strength
and
presence
of
mind
to
cast
upon
colbert
one
of
those
looks
which
are
well
worth
ten
sonnets
which
is
to
say
ten
long
poems
should
you
not
added
the
queen
have
considered
the
refusal
of
the
king
as
a
sort
of
insult
mazarin
rolled
his
head
about
upon
his
pillow
without
articulating
a
syllable
the
queen
was
deceived
or
feigned
to
be
deceived
by
this
demonstration
therefore
resumed
she
i
have
circumvented
him
with
good
counsels
and
as
certain
minds
jealous
no
doubt
of
the
glory
you
are
about
to
acquire
by
this
generosity
have
endeavored
to
prove
to
the
king
that
he
ought
not
to
accept
this
donation
i
have
struggled
in
your
favor
and
so
well
i
have
struggled
that
you
will
not
have
i
hope
that
distress
to
undergo
ah
murmured
mazarin
with
languishing
eyes
ah
that
is
a
service
i
shall
never
forget
for
a
single
minute
of
the
few
hours
i
still
have
to
live
i
must
admit
continued
the
queen
that
it
was
not
without
trouble
i
rendered
it
to
your
eminence
ah
peste
i
believe
that
oh
oh
good
god
what
is
the
matter
i
am
burning
do
you
suffer
much
as
much
as
one
of
the
damned
colbert
would
have
liked
to
sink
through
the
floor
so
then
resumed
mazarin
your
majesty
thinks
that
the
king
he
stopped
several
seconds
that
the
king
is
coming
here
to
offer
me
some
small
thanks
i
think
so
said
queen
mazarin
annihilated
colbert
with
his
last
look
at
that
moment
the
ushers
announced
that
the
king
was
in
the
which
were
filled
with
people
this
announcement
produced
a
stir
of
which
colbert
took
advantage
to
escape
by
the
door
of
the
ruelle
anne
of
austria
arose
and
awaited
her
son
standing
louis
xiv
appeared
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
dying
man
who
did
not
even
think
it
worth
while
to
notice
that
majesty
from
whom
he
thought
he
had
nothing
more
to
expect
an
usher
placed
an
armchair
close
to
the
bed
louis
bowed
to
his
mother
then
to
the
cardinal
and
sat
down
the
queen
took
a
seat
in
her
turn
then
as
the
king
looked
behind
him
the
usher
understood
that
look
and
made
a
sign
to
the
courtiers
who
filled
up
the
doorway
to
go
out
which
they
instantly
did
silence
fell
upon
the
chamber
with
the
velvet
curtains
the
king
still
very
young
and
very
timid
in
the
presence
of
him
who
had
been
his
master
from
his
birth
still
respected
him
much
particularly
now
in
the
supreme
majesty
of
death
he
did
not
dare
therefore
to
begin
the
conversation
feeling
that
every
word
must
have
its
weight
not
only
upon
things
of
this
world
but
of
the
next
as
to
the
cardinal
at
that
moment
he
had
but
one
thought
his
donation
it
was
not
physical
pain
which
gave
him
that
air
of
despondency
and
that
lugubrious
look
it
was
the
expectation
of
the
thanks
that
were
about
to
issue
from
the
king
s
mouth
and
cut
off
all
hope
of
restitution
mazarin
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
is
your
majesty
come
to
make
any
stay
at
vincennes
said
he
louis
made
an
affirmative
sign
with
his
head
that
is
a
gracious
favor
continued
mazarin
granted
to
a
dying
man
and
which
will
render
death
less
painful
to
him
i
hope
replied
the
king
i
am
come
to
visit
not
a
dying
man
but
a
sick
man
susceptible
of
cure
mazarin
replied
by
a
movement
of
the
head
your
majesty
is
very
kind
but
i
know
more
than
you
on
that
subject
the
last
visit
sire
said
he
the
last
visit
if
it
were
so
monsieur
le
cardinal
said
louis
i
would
come
a
last
time
to
ask
the
counsels
of
a
guide
to
whom
i
owe
everything
anne
of
austria
was
a
woman
she
could
not
restrain
her
tears
louis
showed
himself
much
affected
and
mazarin
still
more
than
his
two
guests
but
from
very
different
motives
here
the
silence
returned
the
queen
wiped
her
eyes
and
the
king
resumed
his
firmness
i
was
saying
continued
the
king
that
i
owed
much
to
your
eminence
the
eyes
of
the
cardinal
had
devoured
the
king
for
he
felt
the
great
moment
had
come
and
continued
louis
the
principal
object
of
my
visit
was
to
offer
you
very
sincere
thanks
for
the
last
evidence
of
friendship
you
have
kindly
sent
me
the
cheeks
of
the
cardinal
became
sunken
his
lips
partially
opened
and
the
most
lamentable
sigh
he
had
ever
uttered
was
about
to
issue
from
his
chest
sire
said
he
i
shall
have
despoiled
my
poor
family
i
shall
have
ruined
all
who
belong
to
me
which
may
be
imputed
to
me
as
an
error
but
at
least
it
shall
not
be
said
of
me
that
i
have
refused
to
sacrifice
everything
to
my
king
anne
of
austria
s
tears
flowed
afresh
my
dear
monsieur
mazarin
said
the
king
in
a
more
serious
tone
than
might
have
been
expected
from
his
youth
you
have
misunderstood
me
apparently
mazarin
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
i
have
no
purpose
to
despoil
your
dear
family
nor
to
ruin
your
servants
oh
no
that
must
never
be
humph
thought
mazarin
he
is
going
to
restore
me
some
scraps
let
us
get
the
largest
piece
we
can
the
king
is
going
to
be
foolishly
affected
and
play
generous
thought
the
queen
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
impoverish
himself
such
an
opportunity
for
getting
a
fortune
will
never
occur
again
sire
said
the
cardinal
aloud
my
family
is
very
numerous
and
my
nieces
will
be
destitute
when
i
am
gone
oh
interrupted
the
queen
eagerly
have
no
uneasiness
with
respect
to
your
family
dear
monsieur
mazarin
we
have
no
friends
dearer
than
your
friends
your
nieces
shall
be
my
children
the
sisters
of
his
majesty
and
if
a
favor
be
distributed
in
france
it
shall
be
to
those
you
love
smoke
thought
mazarin
who
knew
better
than
any
one
the
faith
that
can
be
put
in
the
promises
of
kings
louis
read
the
dying
man
s
thought
in
his
face
be
comforted
my
dear
monsieur
mazarin
said
he
with
a
sad
beneath
its
irony
the
mesdemoiselles
de
mancini
will
lose
in
losing
you
their
most
precious
good
but
they
shall
none
the
less
be
the
richest
heiresses
of
france
and
since
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
give
me
their
dowry
the
cardinal
was
panting
i
restore
it
to
them
continued
louis
drawing
from
his
breast
and
holding
towards
the
cardinal
s
bed
the
parchment
which
contained
the
donation
that
during
two
days
had
kept
alive
such
tempests
in
the
mind
of
mazarin
what
did
i
tell
you
my
lord
murmured
in
the
alcove
a
voice
which
passed
away
like
a
breath
your
majesty
returns
my
donation
cried
mazarin
so
disturbed
by
joy
as
to
forget
his
character
of
a
benefactor
your
majesty
rejects
the
forty
millions
cried
anne
of
austria
so
stupefied
as
to
forget
her
character
of
an
afflicted
wife
or
queen
yes
my
lord
cardinal
yes
madame
replied
louis
tearing
the
parchment
which
mazarin
had
not
yet
ventured
to
clutch
yes
i
annihilate
this
deed
which
despoiled
a
whole
family
the
wealth
acquired
by
his
eminence
in
my
service
is
his
own
wealth
and
not
mine
but
sire
does
your
majesty
reflect
said
anne
of
austria
that
you
have
not
ten
thousand
crowns
in
your
coffers
madame
i
have
just
performed
my
first
royal
action
and
i
hope
it
will
worthily
inaugurate
my
reign
ah
sire
you
are
right
cried
mazarin
that
is
truly
great
that
is
truly
generous
which
you
have
just
done
and
he
looked
one
after
the
other
at
the
pieces
of
the
act
spread
over
his
bed
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
the
original
and
not
a
copy
that
had
been
torn
at
length
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
fragment
which
bore
his
signature
and
recognizing
it
he
sunk
back
on
his
bolster
in
a
swoon
anne
of
austria
without
strength
to
conceal
her
regret
raised
her
hands
and
eyes
towards
heaven
oh
sire
cried
mazarin
may
you
be
blessed
my
god
may
you
be
beloved
by
all
my
family
per
baccho
if
ever
any
of
those
belonging
to
me
should
cause
your
displeasure
sire
only
frown
and
i
will
rise
from
my
tomb
this
pantalonnade
did
not
produce
all
the
effect
mazarin
had
counted
upon
louis
had
already
passed
to
considerations
of
a
higher
nature
and
as
to
anne
of
austria
unable
to
bear
without
abandoning
herself
to
the
anger
she
felt
burning
within
her
the
magnanimity
of
her
son
and
the
hypocrisy
of
the
cardinal
she
arose
and
left
the
chamber
heedless
of
thus
betraying
the
extent
of
her
grief
mazarin
saw
all
this
and
fearing
that
louis
xiv
might
repent
his
decision
in
order
to
draw
attention
another
way
he
began
to
cry
out
as
at
a
later
period
scapin
was
to
cry
out
in
that
sublime
piece
of
pleasantry
with
which
the
morose
and
grumbling
boileau
dared
to
reproach
moliere
his
cries
however
by
degrees
became
fainter
and
when
anne
of
austria
left
the
apartment
they
ceased
altogether
monsieur
le
cardinal
said
the
king
have
you
any
recommendations
to
make
me
sire
replied
mazarin
you
are
already
wisdom
itself
prudence
personified
of
your
generosity
i
shall
not
venture
to
speak
that
which
you
have
just
done
exceeds
all
that
the
most
generous
men
of
antiquity
or
of
modern
times
have
ever
done
the
king
received
this
praise
coldly
so
you
confine
yourself
said
he
to
your
thanks
and
your
experience
much
more
extensive
than
my
wisdom
my
prudence
or
my
generosity
does
not
furnish
you
with
a
single
piece
of
friendly
advice
to
guide
my
future
mazarin
reflected
for
a
moment
you
have
just
done
much
for
me
sire
said
he
that
is
for
my
family
say
no
more
about
that
said
the
king
well
continued
mazarin
i
shall
give
you
something
in
exchange
for
these
forty
millions
you
have
refused
so
royally
louis
xiv
indicated
by
a
movement
that
these
flatteries
were
displeasing
to
him
i
shall
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
continued
mazarin
yes
a
piece
of
advice
advice
more
precious
than
the
forty
millions
my
lord
cardinal
interrupted
louis
sire
listen
to
this
advice
i
am
listening
come
nearer
sire
for
i
am
weak
nearer
sire
nearer
the
king
bent
over
the
dying
man
sire
said
mazarin
in
so
low
a
tone
that
the
breath
of
his
words
arrived
only
like
a
recommendation
from
the
tomb
in
the
attentive
ears
of
the
king
sire
never
have
a
prime
minister
louis
drew
back
astonished
the
advice
was
a
confession
a
treasure
in
fact
was
that
sincere
confession
of
mazarin
the
legacy
of
the
cardinal
to
the
young
king
was
composed
of
six
words
only
but
those
six
words
as
mazarin
had
said
were
worth
forty
millions
louis
remained
for
an
instant
bewildered
as
for
mazarin
he
appeared
only
to
have
said
something
quite
natural
a
little
scratching
was
heard
along
the
curtains
of
the
alcove
mazarin
understood
yes
yes
cried
he
warmly
yes
sire
i
recommend
to
you
a
wise
man
an
honest
man
and
a
clever
man
tell
me
his
name
my
lord
his
name
is
yet
almost
unknown
sire
it
is
colbert
my
attendant
oh
try
him
added
mazarin
in
an
earnest
voice
all
that
he
has
predicted
has
come
to
pass
he
has
a
safe
glance
he
is
never
mistaken
either
in
things
or
in
men
which
is
more
surprising
still
sire
i
owe
you
much
but
i
think
i
acquit
myself
of
all
towards
you
in
giving
you
m
colbert
so
be
it
said
louis
faintly
for
as
mazarin
had
said
the
name
of
colbert
was
quite
unknown
to
him
and
he
thought
the
enthusiasm
of
the
cardinal
partook
of
the
delirium
of
a
dying
man
the
cardinal
sank
back
on
his
pillows
for
the
present
adieu
sire
adieu
murmured
mazarin
i
am
tired
and
i
have
yet
a
rough
journey
to
take
before
i
present
myself
to
my
new
master
adieu
sire
the
young
king
felt
the
tears
rise
to
his
eyes
he
bent
over
the
dying
man
already
half
a
corpse
and
then
hastily
retired
chapter
xlix
the
first
appearance
of
colbert
the
whole
night
was
passed
in
anguish
common
to
the
dying
man
and
to
the
king
the
dying
man
expected
his
deliverance
the
king
awaited
his
liberty
louis
did
not
go
to
bed
an
hour
after
leaving
the
chamber
of
the
cardinal
he
learned
that
the
dying
man
recovering
a
little
strength
had
insisted
upon
being
dressed
adorned
and
painted
and
seeing
the
ambassadors
like
augustus
he
no
doubt
considered
the
world
a
great
stage
and
was
desirous
of
playing
out
the
last
act
of
the
comedy
anne
of
austria
reappeared
no
more
in
the
cardinal
s
apartments
she
had
nothing
more
to
do
there
propriety
was
the
pretext
for
her
absence
on
his
part
the
cardinal
did
not
ask
for
her
the
advice
the
queen
had
giver
her
son
rankled
in
his
heart
towards
midnight
while
still
painted
mazarin
s
mortal
agony
came
on
he
had
revised
his
will
and
as
this
will
was
the
exact
expression
of
his
wishes
and
as
he
feared
that
some
interested
influence
might
take
advantage
of
his
weakness
to
make
him
change
something
in
it
he
had
given
orders
to
colbert
who
walked
up
and
down
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
cardinal
s
like
the
most
vigilant
of
sentinels
the
king
shut
up
in
his
own
apartment
dispatched
his
nurse
every
hour
to
mazarin
s
chamber
with
orders
to
bring
him
back
an
exact
bulletin
of
the
cardinal
s
state
after
having
heard
that
mazarin
was
dressed
painted
and
had
seen
the
ambassadors
louis
herd
that
the
prayers
for
the
dying
were
being
read
for
the
cardinal
at
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
guenaud
had
administered
the
last
remedy
this
was
a
relic
of
the
old
customs
of
that
fencing
time
which
was
about
to
disappear
to
give
place
to
another
time
to
believe
that
death
could
be
kept
off
by
some
good
secret
thrust
mazarin
after
having
taken
the
remedy
respired
freely
for
nearly
ten
minutes
he
immediately
gave
orders
that
the
news
should
be
spread
everywhere
of
a
fortunate
crisis
the
king
on
learning
this
felt
as
if
a
cold
sweat
were
passing
over
his
brow
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
the
light
of
liberty
slavery
appeared
to
him
more
dark
and
less
acceptable
than
ever
but
the
bulletin
which
followed
entirely
changed
the
face
of
things
mazarin
could
no
longer
breathe
at
all
and
could
scarcely
follow
the
prayers
which
the
cure
of
recited
near
him
the
king
resumed
his
agitated
walk
about
his
chamber
and
consulted
as
he
walked
several
papers
drawn
from
a
casket
of
which
he
alone
had
the
key
a
third
time
the
nurse
returned
de
mazarin
had
just
uttered
a
joke
and
had
ordered
his
flora
by
titian
to
be
revarnished
at
length
towards
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
king
could
no
longer
resist
his
weariness
he
had
not
slept
for
hours
sleep
so
powerful
at
his
age
overcame
him
for
about
an
hour
but
he
did
not
go
to
bed
for
that
hour
he
slept
in
a
fauteuil
about
four
o
clock
his
nurse
awoke
him
by
entering
the
room
well
asked
the
king
well
my
dear
sire
said
the
nurse
clasping
her
hands
with
an
air
of
commiseration
well
he
is
dead
the
king
arose
at
a
bound
as
if
a
steel
spring
had
been
applied
to
his
legs
dead
cried
he
alas
yes
is
it
quite
certain
yes
official
yes
has
the
news
been
made
public
not
yet
who
told
you
then
that
the
cardinal
was
dead
m
colbert
m
colbert
yes
and
he
was
sure
of
what
he
said
he
came
out
of
the
chamber
and
had
held
a
glass
for
some
minutes
before
the
cardinal
s
lips
ah
said
the
king
and
what
is
become
of
m
colbert
he
has
just
left
his
eminence
s
chamber
where
is
he
he
followed
me
so
that
he
is
sire
waiting
at
your
door
till
it
shall
be
your
good
pleasure
to
receive
him
louis
ran
to
the
door
opened
it
himself
and
perceived
colbert
standing
waiting
in
the
passage
the
king
started
at
sight
of
this
statue
all
clothed
in
black
colbert
bowing
with
profound
respect
advanced
two
steps
towards
his
majesty
louis
his
chamber
making
colbert
a
sign
to
follow
colbert
entered
louis
dismissed
the
nurse
who
closed
the
door
as
she
went
out
colbert
remained
modestly
standing
near
that
door
what
do
you
come
to
announce
to
me
monsieur
said
louis
very
much
troubled
at
being
thus
surprised
in
his
private
thoughts
which
he
could
not
completely
conceal
that
monsieur
le
cardinal
has
just
expired
sire
and
that
i
bring
your
majesty
his
last
adieu
the
king
remained
pensive
for
a
minute
and
during
that
minute
he
looked
attentively
at
colbert
it
was
evident
that
the
cardinal
s
last
words
were
in
his
mind
are
you
then
m
colbert
asked
he
yes
sire
his
faithful
servant
as
his
eminence
himself
told
me
yes
sire
the
depositary
of
many
of
his
secrets
of
all
of
them
the
friends
and
servants
of
his
eminence
will
be
dear
to
me
monsieur
and
i
shall
take
care
that
you
are
well
placed
in
my
employment
colbert
bowed
you
are
a
financier
monsieur
i
believe
yes
sire
and
did
monsieur
le
cardinal
employ
you
in
his
stewardship
i
had
that
honor
sire
you
never
did
anything
personally
for
my
household
i
believe
pardon
me
sire
it
was
i
who
had
the
honor
of
giving
monsieur
le
cardinal
the
idea
of
an
economy
which
puts
three
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
into
your
majesty
s
coffers
what
economy
was
that
monsieur
asked
louis
xiv
your
majesty
knows
that
the
hundred
swiss
have
silver
lace
on
each
side
of
their
ribbons
doubtless
well
sire
it
was
i
who
proposed
that
imitation
silver
lace
should
be
placed
upon
these
ribbons
it
could
not
be
detected
and
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
serve
to
feed
a
regiment
during
six
months
and
is
the
price
of
ten
thousand
good
muskets
or
the
value
of
a
vessel
of
ten
guns
ready
for
sea
that
is
true
said
louis
considering
more
attentively
and
ma
foi
that
was
a
well
placed
economy
besides
it
was
ridiculous
for
soldiers
to
wear
the
same
lace
as
noblemen
i
am
happy
to
be
approved
of
by
your
majesty
is
that
the
only
appointment
you
held
about
the
cardinal
asked
the
king
it
was
i
who
was
appointed
to
examine
the
accounts
of
the
superintendent
sire
ah
said
louis
who
was
about
to
dismiss
colbert
but
whom
that
word
stopped
ah
it
was
you
whom
his
eminence
had
charged
to
control
fouquet
was
it
and
the
result
of
that
examination
is
that
there
is
a
deficit
sire
but
if
your
majesty
will
permit
me
speak
m
colbert
i
ought
to
give
your
majesty
some
explanations
not
at
all
monsieur
it
is
you
who
have
controlled
these
accounts
give
me
the
result
that
is
very
easily
done
sire
emptiness
everywhere
money
nowhere
beware
monsieur
you
are
roughly
attacking
the
administration
of
fouquet
who
nevertheless
i
have
heard
say
is
an
able
man
colbert
colored
and
then
became
pale
for
he
felt
that
from
that
minute
he
entered
upon
a
struggle
with
a
man
whose
power
almost
equaled
the
sway
of
him
who
had
just
died
yes
sire
a
very
able
man
repeated
colbert
bowing
but
if
fouquet
is
an
able
man
and
in
spite
of
that
ability
if
money
be
wanting
whose
fault
is
it
i
do
not
accuse
sire
i
verify
that
is
well
make
out
your
accounts
and
present
them
to
me
there
is
a
deficit
you
say
a
deficit
may
be
temporary
credit
returns
and
funds
are
restored
no
sire
upon
this
year
perhaps
i
understand
that
but
upon
next
year
next
year
is
eaten
as
bare
as
the
current
year
but
the
year
after
then
will
be
just
like
next
year
what
do
you
tell
me
monsieur
colbert
i
say
there
are
four
years
engaged
beforehand
they
must
have
a
loan
then
they
must
have
three
sire
i
will
create
offices
to
make
them
resign
and
the
salary
of
the
posts
shall
be
paid
into
the
treasury
impossible
sire
for
there
have
already
been
creations
upon
creations
of
offices
the
provisions
of
which
are
given
in
blank
so
that
the
purchasers
enjoy
them
without
filling
them
that
is
why
your
majesty
can
not
make
them
resign
further
upon
each
agreement
fouquet
has
made
an
abatement
of
a
third
so
that
the
people
have
been
plundered
without
your
majesty
profiting
by
it
the
king
started
explain
me
that
colbert
he
said
let
your
majesty
set
down
clearly
your
thought
and
tell
me
what
you
wish
me
to
explain
you
are
right
clearness
is
what
you
wish
is
it
not
yes
sire
clearness
god
is
god
above
all
things
because
he
made
light
well
for
example
resumed
louis
if
the
cardinal
being
dead
and
i
being
king
suppose
i
wanted
money
your
majesty
would
not
have
any
oh
that
is
strange
monsieur
how
my
superintendent
would
not
find
me
any
money
colbert
shook
his
large
head
how
is
that
said
the
king
is
the
income
of
the
state
so
much
in
debt
that
there
is
no
longer
any
revenue
yes
sire
the
king
frowned
and
said
if
it
be
so
i
will
get
together
the
ordonnances
to
obtain
a
discharge
from
the
holders
a
liquidation
at
a
cheap
rate
impossible
for
the
ordonnances
have
been
converted
into
bills
which
bills
for
the
convenience
of
return
and
facility
of
transaction
are
divided
into
so
many
parts
that
the
originals
can
no
longer
be
recognized
louis
very
much
agitated
walked
about
still
frowning
but
if
this
is
as
you
say
monsieur
colbert
said
he
stopping
all
at
once
i
shall
be
ruined
before
i
begin
to
reign
you
are
in
fact
sire
said
the
impassible
of
figures
well
but
yet
monsieur
the
money
is
somewhere
yes
sire
and
even
as
a
beginning
i
bring
your
majesty
a
note
of
funds
which
le
cardinal
mazarin
was
not
willing
to
set
down
in
his
testament
neither
in
any
act
whatever
but
which
he
confided
to
me
to
you
yes
sire
with
an
injunction
to
remit
it
to
your
majesty
what
besides
the
forty
millions
of
the
testament
yes
sire
de
mazarin
had
still
other
funds
colbert
bowed
why
that
man
was
a
gulf
murmured
the
king
de
mazarin
on
one
side
fouquet
on
the
other
more
than
a
hundred
millions
perhaps
between
them
no
wonder
my
coffers
should
be
empty
colbert
waited
without
stirring
and
is
the
sum
you
bring
me
worth
the
trouble
asked
the
king
yes
sire
it
is
a
round
sum
amounting
to
how
much
to
thirteen
millions
of
livres
sire
thirteen
millions
cried
louis
trembling
with
joy
do
you
say
thirteen
millions
monsieur
colbert
i
said
thirteen
millions
yes
your
majesty
of
which
everybody
is
ignorant
of
which
everybody
is
ignorant
which
are
in
your
hands
in
my
hands
yes
sire
and
which
i
can
have
within
two
hours
sire
but
where
are
they
then
in
the
cellar
of
a
house
which
the
cardinal
possessed
in
the
city
and
which
he
was
so
kind
as
to
leave
me
by
a
particular
clause
of
his
will
you
are
acquainted
with
the
cardinal
s
will
then
i
have
a
duplicate
of
it
signed
by
his
hand
a
duplicate
yes
sire
and
here
it
is
colbert
drew
the
deed
quietly
from
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
king
the
king
read
the
article
relative
to
the
donation
of
the
house
but
said
he
there
is
no
question
here
but
of
the
house
there
is
nothing
said
of
the
money
your
pardon
sire
it
is
in
my
conscience
and
monsieur
mazarin
has
intrusted
it
to
you
why
not
sire
he
a
man
mistrustful
of
everybody
he
was
not
so
of
me
sire
as
your
majesty
may
perceive
louis
fixed
his
eyes
with
admiration
upon
that
vulgar
but
expressive
face
you
are
an
honest
man
colbert
said
the
king
that
is
not
a
virtue
it
is
a
duty
replied
colbert
coolly
but
added
louis
does
not
the
money
belong
to
the
family
if
this
money
belonged
to
the
family
it
would
be
disposed
of
in
the
testament
as
the
rest
of
the
fortune
is
if
this
money
belonged
to
the
family
i
who
drew
up
the
deed
of
donation
in
favor
of
your
majesty
should
have
added
the
sum
of
thirteen
millions
to
that
of
forty
millions
which
was
offered
to
you
how
exclaimed
louis
was
it
you
who
drew
up
the
deed
of
donation
yes
sire
and
yet
the
cardinal
was
attached
to
you
added
the
king
ingenuously
i
had
assured
his
eminence
you
would
by
no
means
accept
the
gift
said
colbert
in
that
same
quiet
manner
we
have
described
and
which
even
in
the
common
habits
of
life
had
something
solemn
in
it
louis
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
oh
how
young
i
am
murmured
he
to
have
command
of
men
colbert
waited
the
end
of
this
monologue
he
saw
louis
raise
his
head
at
what
hour
shall
i
send
the
money
to
your
majesty
asked
he
at
eleven
o
clock
i
desire
that
no
one
may
know
that
i
possess
this
money
colbert
made
no
more
reply
than
if
the
thing
had
not
been
said
to
him
is
the
amount
in
ingots
or
coined
gold
in
coined
gold
sire
that
is
well
where
shall
i
send
it
to
the
louvre
thank
you
m
colbert
colbert
bowed
and
retired
thirteen
millions
exclaimed
louis
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
this
must
be
a
dream
then
he
allowed
his
head
to
sink
between
his
hands
as
if
he
were
really
asleep
but
at
the
end
of
a
moment
he
arose
and
opening
the
window
violently
he
bathed
his
burning
brow
in
the
keen
morning
air
which
brought
to
his
senses
the
scent
of
the
trees
and
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
a
splendid
dawn
was
gilding
the
horizon
and
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
bathed
in
flame
the
young
king
s
brow
this
is
the
dawn
of
my
reign
murmured
louis
xiv
it
s
a
presage
sent
by
the
almighty
chapter
l
the
first
day
of
the
royalty
of
louis
xiv
in
the
morning
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
cardinal
was
spread
through
the
castle
and
thence
speedily
reached
the
city
the
ministers
fouquet
lyonne
and
letellier
entered
la
salle
des
seances
to
hold
a
council
the
king
sent
for
them
immediately
messieurs
said
he
as
long
as
monsieur
le
cardinal
lived
i
allowed
him
to
govern
my
affairs
but
now
i
mean
to
govern
them
myself
you
will
give
me
your
advice
when
i
ask
it
you
may
go
the
ministers
looked
at
each
other
with
surprise
if
they
concealed
a
smile
it
was
with
a
great
effort
for
they
knew
that
the
prince
brought
up
in
absolute
ignorance
of
business
by
this
took
upon
himself
a
burden
much
too
heavy
for
his
strength
fouquet
took
leave
of
his
colleagues
upon
the
stairs
saying
messieurs
there
will
be
so
much
the
less
labor
for
us
and
he
gayly
climbed
into
his
carriage
the
others
a
little
uneasy
at
the
turn
things
had
taken
went
back
to
paris
together
towards
ten
o
clock
the
king
repaired
to
the
apartment
of
his
mother
with
whom
he
had
a
long
and
private
conversation
after
dinner
he
got
into
his
carriage
and
went
straight
to
the
louvre
there
he
received
much
company
and
took
a
degree
of
pleasure
in
remarking
the
hesitation
of
each
and
the
curiosity
of
all
towards
evening
he
ordered
the
doors
of
the
louvre
to
be
closed
with
the
exception
of
only
one
which
opened
on
the
quay
he
placed
on
duty
at
this
point
two
hundred
swiss
who
did
not
speak
a
word
of
french
with
orders
to
admit
all
who
carried
packages
but
no
others
and
by
no
means
to
allow
any
one
to
go
out
at
eleven
o
clock
precisely
he
heard
the
rolling
of
a
heavy
carriage
under
the
arch
then
of
another
then
of
a
third
after
which
the
gate
grated
upon
its
hinges
to
be
closed
soon
after
somebody
scratched
with
his
nail
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
the
king
opened
it
himself
and
beheld
colbert
whose
first
word
was
this
the
money
is
in
your
majesty
s
cellar
the
king
then
descended
and
went
himself
to
see
the
barrels
of
specie
in
gold
and
silver
which
under
the
direction
of
colbert
four
men
had
just
rolled
into
a
cellar
of
which
the
king
had
given
colbert
the
key
in
the
morning
this
review
completed
louis
returned
to
his
apartments
followed
by
colbert
who
had
not
apparently
warmed
with
one
ray
of
personal
satisfaction
monsieur
said
the
king
what
do
you
wish
that
i
should
give
you
as
a
recompense
for
this
devotedness
and
probity
absolutely
nothing
sire
how
nothing
not
even
an
opportunity
of
serving
me
if
your
majesty
were
not
to
furnish
me
with
that
opportunity
i
should
not
the
less
serve
you
it
is
impossible
for
me
not
to
be
the
best
servant
of
the
king
you
shall
be
intendant
of
the
finances
m
colbert
but
there
is
already
a
superintendent
sire
i
know
that
sire
the
superintendent
of
the
finances
is
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
kingdom
ah
cried
louis
coloring
do
you
think
so
he
will
crush
me
in
a
week
sire
your
majesty
gives
me
a
controle
for
which
strength
is
indispensable
an
intendant
under
a
superintendent
that
is
inferiority
you
want
support
you
do
not
reckon
upon
me
i
had
the
honor
of
telling
your
majesty
that
during
the
lifetime
of
de
mazarin
fouquet
was
the
second
man
in
the
kingdom
now
de
mazarin
is
dead
fouquet
is
become
the
first
monsieur
i
agree
to
what
you
told
me
of
all
things
up
to
but
please
to
remember
i
shall
no
longer
suffer
it
then
i
shall
be
of
no
use
to
your
majesty
you
are
already
since
you
fear
to
compromise
yourself
in
serving
me
i
only
fear
to
be
placed
so
that
i
can
not
serve
your
majesty
what
do
you
wish
then
i
wish
your
majesty
to
allow
me
assistance
in
the
labors
of
the
office
of
intendant
that
post
would
lose
its
value
it
would
gain
in
security
choose
your
colleagues
messieurs
breteuil
marin
hervart
the
ordonnance
shall
appear
sire
i
thank
you
is
that
all
you
ask
no
sire
one
thing
more
what
is
that
allow
me
to
compose
a
chamber
of
justice
what
would
this
chamber
of
justice
do
try
the
and
contractors
who
during
ten
years
have
been
robbing
the
state
well
but
what
would
you
do
with
them
hang
two
or
three
and
that
would
make
the
rest
disgorge
i
can
not
commence
my
reign
with
executions
monsieur
colbert
on
the
contrary
sire
you
had
better
in
order
not
to
have
to
end
with
them
the
king
made
no
reply
does
your
majesty
consent
said
colbert
i
will
reflect
upon
it
monsieur
it
will
be
too
late
when
reflection
may
be
made
why
because
you
have
to
deal
with
people
stronger
than
ourselves
if
they
are
warned
compose
that
chamber
of
justice
monsieur
i
will
sire
is
that
all
no
sire
there
is
still
another
important
affair
what
rights
does
your
majesty
attach
to
this
office
of
intendant
well
i
do
not
know
the
customary
ones
sire
i
desire
that
this
office
be
invested
with
the
right
of
reading
the
correspondence
with
england
impossible
monsieur
for
that
correspondence
is
kept
from
the
council
monsieur
le
cardinal
himself
carried
it
on
i
thought
your
majesty
had
this
morning
declared
that
there
should
no
longer
be
a
council
yes
i
said
so
let
your
majesty
then
have
the
goodness
to
read
all
the
letters
yourself
particularly
those
from
england
i
hold
strongly
to
this
article
monsieur
you
shall
have
that
correspondence
and
render
me
an
account
of
it
now
sire
what
shall
i
do
with
respect
to
the
finances
everything
fouquet
has
not
done
that
is
all
i
ask
of
your
majesty
thanks
sire
i
depart
in
peace
and
at
these
words
he
took
his
leave
louis
watched
his
departure
colbert
was
not
yet
a
hundred
paces
from
the
louvre
when
the
king
received
a
courier
from
england
after
having
looked
at
and
examined
the
envelope
the
king
broke
the
seal
precipitately
and
found
a
letter
from
charles
ii
the
following
is
what
the
english
prince
wrote
to
his
royal
brother
your
majesty
must
be
rendered
very
uneasy
by
the
illness
of
le
cardinal
mazarin
but
the
excess
of
danger
can
only
prove
of
service
to
you
the
cardinal
is
given
over
by
his
physician
i
thank
you
for
the
gracious
reply
you
have
made
to
my
communication
touching
the
princess
henrietta
my
sister
and
in
a
week
the
princess
and
her
court
will
set
out
for
paris
it
is
gratifying
to
me
to
acknowledge
the
fraternal
friendship
you
have
evinced
towards
me
and
to
call
you
more
justly
than
ever
my
brother
it
is
gratifying
to
me
above
everything
to
prove
to
your
majesty
how
much
i
am
interested
in
all
that
may
please
you
you
are
wrong
in
having
secretly
fortified
that
is
wrong
we
shall
never
be
at
war
against
each
other
that
measure
does
not
make
me
uneasy
it
makes
me
sad
you
are
spending
useless
millions
tell
your
ministers
so
and
rest
assured
that
i
am
well
informed
render
me
the
same
service
my
brother
if
occasion
offers
the
king
rang
his
bell
violently
and
his
valet
de
chambre
appeared
monsieur
colbert
is
just
gone
he
can
not
be
far
off
let
him
be
called
back
exclaimed
he
the
valet
was
about
to
execute
the
order
when
the
king
stopped
him
no
said
he
no
i
see
the
whole
scheme
of
that
man
belongs
to
fouquet
is
being
fortified
that
is
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
fouquet
the
discovery
of
that
conspiracy
is
the
ruin
of
the
superintendent
and
that
discovery
is
the
result
of
the
correspondence
with
england
this
is
why
colbert
wished
to
have
that
correspondence
oh
but
i
can
not
place
all
my
dependence
upon
that
man
he
has
a
good
head
but
i
must
have
an
arm
louis
all
at
once
uttered
a
joyful
cry
i
had
said
he
a
lieutenant
of
musketeers
yes
sire
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
quitted
the
service
for
a
time
yes
sire
let
him
be
found
and
be
here
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
valet
de
chambre
bowed
and
went
out
thirteen
millions
in
my
cellar
said
the
king
colbert
carrying
my
purse
and
d
artagnan
my
sword
i
am
king
chapter
li
a
passion
the
day
of
his
arrival
on
returning
from
the
palais
royal
athos
as
we
have
seen
went
straight
to
his
hotel
in
the
rue
he
there
found
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
waiting
for
him
in
his
chamber
chatting
with
grimaud
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
talk
with
this
old
servant
two
men
only
possessed
the
secret
athos
and
d
artagnan
the
first
succeeded
because
grimaud
sought
to
make
him
speak
himself
d
artagnan
on
the
contrary
because
he
knew
how
to
make
grimaud
talk
raoul
was
occupied
in
making
him
describe
the
voyage
to
england
and
grimaud
had
related
it
in
all
its
details
with
a
limited
number
of
gestures
and
eight
words
neither
more
nor
less
he
had
at
first
indicated
by
an
undulating
movement
of
his
hand
that
his
master
and
he
had
crossed
the
sea
upon
some
expedition
raoul
had
asked
grimaud
by
bending
down
his
head
had
answered
yes
when
monsieur
le
comte
incurred
much
danger
asked
raoul
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
was
replied
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
but
still
what
sort
of
danger
insisted
raoul
grimaud
pointed
to
the
sword
he
pointed
to
the
fire
and
to
a
musket
that
was
hanging
on
the
wall
monsieur
le
comte
had
an
enemy
there
then
cried
raoul
monk
replied
grimaud
it
is
strange
continued
raoul
that
monsieur
le
comte
persists
in
considering
me
a
novice
and
not
allowing
me
to
partake
the
honor
and
danger
of
his
adventure
grimaud
smiled
it
was
at
this
moment
athos
came
in
the
host
was
lighting
him
up
the
stairs
and
grimaud
recognizing
the
step
of
his
master
hastened
to
meet
him
which
cut
short
the
conversation
but
raoul
was
launched
on
the
sea
of
interrogatories
and
did
not
stop
taking
both
hands
of
the
comte
with
warm
but
respectful
tenderness
how
is
it
monsieur
said
he
that
you
have
set
out
upon
a
dangerous
voyage
without
bidding
me
adieu
without
commanding
the
aid
of
my
sword
of
myself
who
ought
to
be
your
support
now
i
have
the
strength
whom
you
have
brought
up
like
a
man
ah
monsieur
can
you
expose
me
to
the
cruel
trial
of
never
seeing
you
again
who
told
you
raoul
said
the
comte
placing
his
cloak
and
hat
in
the
hands
of
grimaud
who
had
unbuckled
his
sword
who
told
you
that
my
voyage
was
a
dangerous
one
i
said
grimaud
and
why
did
you
do
so
said
athos
sternly
grimaud
was
embarrassed
raoul
came
to
his
assistance
by
answering
for
him
it
is
natural
monsieur
that
our
good
grimaud
should
tell
me
the
truth
in
what
concerns
you
by
whom
should
you
be
loved
an
supported
if
not
by
me
athos
did
not
reply
he
made
a
friendly
motion
to
grimaud
which
sent
him
out
of
the
room
he
then
seated
himself
in
a
fauteuil
whilst
raoul
remained
standing
before
him
but
it
is
true
continued
raoul
that
your
voyage
was
an
expedition
and
that
steel
and
fire
threatened
you
say
no
more
about
that
vicomte
said
athos
mildly
i
set
out
hastily
it
is
true
but
the
service
of
king
charles
ii
required
a
prompt
departure
as
to
your
anxiety
i
thank
you
for
it
and
i
know
that
i
can
depend
on
you
you
have
not
wanted
for
anything
vicomte
in
my
absence
have
you
no
monsieur
thank
you

hundred
pistoles
if
you
should
stand
in
need
of
money
monsieur
i
have
not
seen

without
money
then
monsieur
i
had
thirty
pistoles
left
from
the
sale
of
the
horses
i
took
in
my
last
campaign
and
le
prince

the
kindness
to
allow
me
to
win
two
hundred
pistoles
at
his
three
months
ago
do
you
play
i
don
t
like
that
raoul
i
never
play
monsieur
it
was
le
prince
who
ordered
me
to
hold
his
cards
at
chantilly
one
night
when
a
courier
came
to
him
from
the
king
i
won
and
le
prince
commanded
me
to
take
the
stakes
is
that
a
practice
in
the
household
raoul
asked
athos
with
a
frown
yes
monsieur
every
week
le
prince
affords
upon
one
occasion
or
another
a
similar
advantage
to
one
of
his
gentlemen
there
are
fifty
gentlemen
in
his
highness
s
household
it
was
my
turn
very
well
you
went
into
spain
then
yes
monsieur
i
made
a
very
delightful
and
interesting
journey
you
have
been
back
a
month
have
you
not
yes
monsieur
and
in
the
course
of
that
month
in
that
month
what
have
you
done
my
duty
monsieur
have
you
not
been
home
to
la
fere
raoul
colored
athos
looked
at
him
with
a
fixed
but
tranquil
expression
you
would
be
wrong
not
to
believe
me
said
raoul
i
feel
that
i
colored
and
in
spite
of
myself
the
question
you
did
me
the
honor
to
ask
me
is
of
a
nature
to
raise
in
me
much
emotion
i
color
then
because
i
am
agitated
not
because
i
meditate
a
falsehood
i
know
raoul
you
never
lie
no
monsieur
besides
my
young
friend
you
would
be
wrong
what
i
wanted
to
say
i
know
quite
well
monsieur
you
would
ask
me
if
i
have
not
been
to
blois
exactly
so
i
have
not
been
there
i
have
not
even
seen
the
person
to
whom
you
allude
raoul
s
voice
trembled
as
he
pronounced
these
words
athos
a
sovereign
judge
in
all
matters
of
delicacy
immediately
added
raoul
you
answer
me
with
a
painful
feeling
you
are
unhappy
very
monsieur
you
have
forbidden
me
to
go
to
blois
or
to
see
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
again
here
the
young
man
stopped
that
dear
name
so
delightful
to
pronounce
made
his
heart
bleed
although
so
sweet
upon
his
lips
and
i
have
acted
rightly
raoul
athos
hastened
to
reply
i
am
neither
an
unjust
nor
a
barbarous
father
i
respect
true
love
but
i
look
forward
for
you
to
a
future
an
immense
future
a
new
reign
is
about
to
break
upon
us
like
a
fresh
dawn
war
calls
upon
a
young
king
full
of
chivalric
spirit
what
is
wanting
to
assist
this
heroic
ardor
is
a
battalion
of
young
and
free
lieutenants
who
would
rush
to
the
fight
with
enthusiasm
and
fall
crying
vive
le
roi
instead
of
adieu
my
dear
you
understand
that
raoul
however
brutal
my
reasoning
may
appear
i
conjure
you
then
to
believe
me
and
to
turn
away
your
thoughts
from
those
early
days
of
youth
in
which
you
took
up
this
habit
of
love
days
of
effeminate
carelessness
which
soften
the
heart
and
render
it
incapable
of
consuming
those
strong
bitter
draughts
called
glory
and
adversity
therefore
raoul
i
repeat
to
you
you
should
see
in
my
counsel
only
the
desire
of
being
useful
to
you
only
the
ambition
of
seeing
you
prosper
i
believe
you
capable
of
becoming
a
remarkable
man
march
alone
and
you
will
march
better
and
more
quickly
you
have
commanded
monsieur
replied
raoul
and
i
obey
commanded
cried
athos
is
it
thus
you
reply
to
me
i
have
commanded
you
oh
you
distort
my
words
as
you
misconceive
my
intentions
i
do
not
command
you
i
request
you
no
monsieur
you
have
commanded
said
raoul
persistently
had
you
requested
me
your
request
is
even
more
effective
than
your
order
i
have
not
seen
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
again
but
you
are
unhappy
you
are
unhappy
insisted
athos
raoul
made
no
reply
i
find
you
pale
i
find
you
dull
the
sentiment
is
strong
then
it
is
a
passion
replied
raoul
no
a
habit
monsieur
you
know
i
have
traveled
much
that
i
have
passed
two
years
far
away
from
her
a
habit
would
yield
to
an
absence
of
two
years
i
believe
whereas
on
my
return
i
loved
not
more
that
was
impossible
but
as
much
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
is
for
me
the
one
lady
above
all
others
but
you
are
for
me
a
god
upon
earth
to
you
i
sacrifice
everything
you
are
wrong
said
athos
i
have
no
longer
any
right
over
you
age
has
emancipated
you
you
no
longer
even
stand
in
need
of
my
consent
besides
i
will
not
refuse
my
consent
after
what
you
have
told
me
marry
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
if
you
like
raoul
was
startled
but
suddenly
you
are
very
kind
monsieur
said
he
and
your
concession
excites
my
warmest
gratitude
but
i
will
not
accept
it
then
you
now
refuse
yes
monsieur
i
will
not
oppose
you
in
anything
raoul
but
you
have
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
an
idea
against
this
marriage
it
is
not
your
choice
that
is
true
that
is
sufficient
to
make
me
resist
i
will
wait
beware
raoul
what
you
are
now
saying
is
serious
i
know
it
is
monsieur
as
i
said
i
will
wait
until
i
die
said
athos
much
agitated
oh
monsieur
cried
raoul
with
tears
in
his
eyes
is
it
possible
that
you
should
wound
my
heart
thus
i
have
never
given
you
cause
of
complaint
dear
boy
that
is
true
murmured
athos
pressing
his
lips
violently
together
to
conceal
the
emotion
of
which
he
was
no
longer
master
no
i
will
no
longer
afflict
you
only
i
do
not
comprehend
what
you
mean
by
waiting
will
you
wait
till
you
love
no
longer
ah
for
that
no
monsieur
i
will
wait
till
you
change
your
opinion
i
should
wish
to
put
the
matter
to
a
test
raoul
i
should
like
to
see
if
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
will
wait
as
you
do
i
hope
so
monsieur
but
take
care
raoul
suppose
she
did
not
wait
ah
you
are
young
so
confiding
so
loyal
women
are
changeable
you
have
never
spoken
ill
to
me
of
women
monsieur
you
have
never
had
to
complain
of
them
why
should
you
doubt
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
that
is
true
said
athos
casting
down
his
eyes
i
have
never
spoken
ill
to
you
of
women
i
have
never
had
to
complain
of
them
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
never
gave
birth
to
a
suspicion
but
when
we
are
looking
forward
we
must
go
even
to
exceptions
even
to
improbabilities
if
i
say
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
should
not
wait
for
you
how
monsieur
if
she
turned
her
eyes
another
way
if
she
looked
favorably
upon
another
do
you
mean
monsieur
said
raoul
pale
with
agony
exactly
well
monsieur
i
would
kill
him
said
raoul
simply
and
all
the
men
whom
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
should
choose
until
one
of
them
had
killed
me
or
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
restored
me
her
heart
athos
started
i
thought
resumed
he
in
an
agitated
voice
that
you
called
my
just
now
your
god
your
law
in
this
world
oh
said
raoul
trembling
you
would
forbid
me
the
duel
suppose
i
did
forbid
it
raoul
you
would
not
forbid
me
to
hope
monsieur
consequently
you
would
not
forbid
me
to
die
athos
raised
his
eyes
toward
the
vicomte
he
had
pronounced
these
words
with
the
most
melancholy
look
enough
said
athos
after
a
long
silence
enough
of
this
subject
upon
which
we
both
go
too
far
live
as
well
as
you
are
able
raoul
perform
your
duties
love
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
in
a
word
act
like
a
man
since
you
have
attained
the
age
of
a
man
only
do
not
forget
that
i
love
you
tenderly
and
that
you
profess
to
love
me
ah
monsieur
le
comte
cried
raoul
pressing
the
hand
of
athos
to
his
heart
enough

boy

propos

artagnan

great
pleasure

right
in
doing
so

a
worthy
man
and

brave
cavalier
who
loves
you
dearly
i
am
sure
of
that
do
you

address

the
louvre

at

house
of
a
certain
planchet

former
lackey

des
lombards

raoul
chapter
lii
d
artagnan
s
lesson
raoul
did
not
meet
with
d
artagnan
the
next
day
as
he
had
hoped
he
only
met
with
planchet
whose
joy
was
great
at
seeing
the
young
man
again
and
who
contrived
to
pay
him
two
or
three
little
soldierly
compliments
savoring
very
little
of
the
grocer
s
shop
but
as
raoul
was
returning
the
next
day
from
vincennes
at
the
head
of
fifty
dragoons
confided
to
him
by
monsieur
le
prince
he
perceived
in
la
place
baudoyer
a
man
with
his
nose
in
the
air
examining
a
house
as
we
examine
a
horse
we
have
a
fancy
to
buy
this
man
dressed
in
a
citizen
costume
buttoned
up
like
a
military
pourpoint
a
very
small
hat
on
his
head
but
a
long
sword
by
his
side
turned
his
head
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
steps
of
the
horses
and
left
off
looking
at
the
house
to
look
at
the
dragoons
it
was
simply
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
on
foot
d
artagnan
with
his
hands
behind
him
passing
a
little
review
upon
the
dragoons
after
having
reviewed
the
buildings
not
a
man
not
a
tag
not
a
horse
s
hoof
escaped
his
inspection
raoul
rode
at
the
side
of
his
troop
d
artagnan
perceived
him
the
last
eh
said
he
eh
mordioux
i
was
not
mistaken
cried
raoul
turning
his
horse
towards
him
mistaken
no
to
you
replied
the
whilst
raoul
eagerly
pressed
the
hand
of
his
old
friend
take
care
raoul
said
d
artagnan
the
second
horse
of
the
fifth
rank
will
lose
a
shoe
before
he
gets
to
the
pont
marie
he
has
only
two
nails
left
in
his
off
wait
a
minute
i
will
come
back
said
raoul
can
you
quit
your
detachment
the
cornet
is
there
to
take
my
place
then
you
will
come
and
dine
with
me
most
willingly
monsieur
d
artagnan
be
quick
then
leave
your
horse
or
make
them
give
me
one
i
prefer
coming
back
on
foot
with
you
raoul
hastened
to
give
notice
to
the
cornet
who
took
his
post
he
then
dismounted
gave
his
horse
to
one
of
the
dragoons
and
with
great
delight
seized
the
arm
of
d
artagnan
who
had
watched
him
during
all
these
little
evolutions
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
connoisseur
what
do
you
come
from
vincennes
said
he
yes
monsieur
le
chevalier
and
the
cardinal
is
very
ill
it
is
even
reported
he
is
dead
are
you
on
good
terms
with
m
fouquet
asked
d
artagnan
with
a
disdainful
movement
of
the
shoulders
proving
that
the
death
of
mazarin
did
not
affect
him
beyond
measure
with
m
fouquet
said
raoul
i
do
not
know
him
so
much
the
worse
so
much
the
worse
for
a
new
king
always
seeks
to
get
good
men
in
his
employment
oh
the
king
means
no
harm
replied
the
young
man
i
say
nothing
about
the
crown
cried
d
artagnan
i
am
speaking
of
the
king
the
king
that
is
fouquet
if
the
cardinal
is
dead
you
must
contrive
to
stand
well
with
fouquet
if
you
do
not
wish
to
molder
away
all
your
life
as
i
have
moldered
it
is
true
you
have
fortunately
other
protectors
le
prince
for
instance
worn
out
worn
out
le
comte
de
la
fere
athos
oh
that
s
different
yes
athos
and
if
you
have
any
wish
to
make
your
way
in
england
you
can
not
apply
to
a
better
person
i
can
even
say
without
too
much
vanity
that
i
myself
have
some
credit
at
the
court
of
charles
ii
there
is
a
king
god
speed
him
ah
cried
raoul
with
the
natural
curiosity
of
young
people
while
listening
to
experience
and
courage
yes
a
king
who
amuses
himself
it
is
true
but
who
has
had
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
can
appreciate
useful
men
athos
is
on
good
terms
with
charles
ii
take
service
there
and
leave
these
scoundrels
of
contractors
and
who
steal
as
well
with
french
hands
as
others
have
done
with
italian
hands
leave
the
little
snivelling
king
who
is
going
to
give
us
another
reign
of
francis
ii
do
you
know
anything
of
history
raoul
yes
monsieur
le
chevalier
do
you
know
then
that
francis
ii
had
always
the
earache
no
i
did
not
know
that
that
charles
iv
had
always
the
headache
indeed
and
henry
iii
had
always
the
raoul
began
to
laugh
well
my
dear
friend
louis
xiv
always
has
the
it
is
deplorable
to
see
a
king
sighing
from
morning
till
night
without
saying
once
in
the
course
of
the
day
corboef
or
anything
to
rouse
one
was
that
the
reason
why
you
quitted
the
service
monsieur
le
chevalier
yes
but
you
yourself
d
artagnan
are
throwing
the
handle
after
the
axe
you
will
not
make
a
fortune
who
i
replied
d
artagnan
in
a
careless
tone
i
am
settled
i
had
some
family
property
raoul
looked
at
him
the
poverty
of
d
artagnan
was
proverbial
a
gascon
he
exceeded
in
all
the
gasconnades
of
france
and
navarre
raoul
had
a
hundred
times
heard
job
and
d
artagnan
named
together
as
the
twins
romulus
and
remus
d
artagnan
caught
raoul
s
look
of
astonishment
and
has
not
your
father
told
you
i
have
been
in
england
yes
monsieur
le
chevalier
and
that
i
there
met
with
a
very
lucky
chance
no

did
not
know
that
yes
a
very
worthy
friend
of
mine

great
nobleman

viceroy
of
scotland
and
ireland

endowed
me

for
five
hundred
livres
indeed
yes
indeed
five
hundred
livres
for
a
garret
why
it
is
not
habitable
therefore
no
one
inhabits
it
only
you
see
this
garret
has
two
windows
which
look
out
upon
the
place
yes
monsieur
well
then
every
time
anybody
is
broken
on
the
wheel
or
hung
quartered
or
burnt
these
two
windows
let
for
twenty
pistoles
oh
said
raoul
with
horror
it
is
disgusting
is
it
not
said
d
artagnan
oh
repeated
raoul
it
is
disgusting
but
so
it
is
these
parisian
cockneys
are
sometimes
real
anthropophagi
i
can
not
conceive
how
men
christians
can
make
such
speculation
that
is
true
as
for
myself
continued
d
artagnan
if
i
inhabited
that
house
on
days
of
execution
i
would
shut
it
up
to
the
very
keyholes
but
i
do
not
inhabit
it
and
you
let
the
garret
for
five
hundred
livres
to
the
ferocious
cabaretier
who
it
i
said
then
fifteen
hundred
livres
the
natural
interest
of
money
said
raoul
five
per
cent
exactly
so
i
then
have
left
the
side
of
the
house
at
the
back
and
cellars
inundated
every
winter
two
hundred
livres
and
the
garden
which
is
very
fine
well
planted
well
shaded
under
the
walls
and
the
portal
of
thirteen
hundred
livres
thirteen
hundred
livres
why
that
is
royal
this
is
the
whole
history
i
strongly
suspect
some
canon
of
the
parish
these
canons
are
all
rich
as
croesus
i
suspect
some
canon
of
having
hired
the
garden
to
take
his
pleasure
in
the
tenant
has
given
the
name
of
godard
that
is
either
a
false
name
or
a
real
name
if
true
he
is
a
canon
if
false
he
is
some
unknown
but
of
what
consequence
is
it
to
me
he
always
pays
in
advance
i
had
also
an
idea
just
now
when
i
met
you
of
buying
a
house
in
the
place
baudoyer
the
back
premises
of
which
join
my
garden
and
would
make
a
magnificent
property
your
dragoons
interrupted
my
calculations
but
come
let
us
take
the
rue
de
la
vannerie
that
will
lead
us
straight
to
m
planchet
s
d
artagnan
mended
his
pace
and
conducted
raoul
to
planchet
s
dwelling
a
chamber
of
which
the
grocer
had
given
up
to
his
old
master
planchet
was
out
but
the
dinner
was
ready
there
was
a
remains
of
military
regularity
and
punctuality
preserved
in
the
grocer
s
household
d
artagnan
returned
to
the
subject
of
raoul
s
future
your
father
brings
you
up
rather
strictly
said
he
justly
monsieur
le
chevalier
oh
yes
i
know
athos
is
just
but
close
perhaps
a
royal
hand
monsieur
d
artagnan
well
never
want
my
boy
if
ever
you
stand
in
need
of
a
few
pistoles
the
old
musketeer
is
at
hand
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
do
you
play
a
little
never
successful
with
the
ladies
then
oh
my
little
aramis
that
my
dear
friend
costs
even
more
than
play
it
is
true
we
fight
when
we
lose
that
is
a
compensation
bah
that
little
sniveller
the
king
makes
winners
give
him
his
revenge
what
a
reign
my
poor
raoul
what
a
reign
when
we
think
that
in
my
time
the
musketeers
were
besieged
in
their
houses
like
hector
and
priam
in
the
city
of
troy
and
the
women
wept
and
then
the
walls
laughed
and
then
five
hundred
beggarly
fellows
clapped
their
hands
and
cried
kill
kill
when
not
one
musketeer
was
hurt
mordioux
you
will
never
see
anything
like
that
you
are
very
hard
upon
the
king
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
and
yet
you
scarcely
know
him
i
listen
raoul
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
take
note
of
my
words
i
will
predict
what
he
will
do
the
cardinal
being
dead
he
will
fret
very
well
that
is
the
least
silly
thing
he
will
do
particularly
if
he
does
not
shed
a
tear
and
then
why
then
he
will
get
fouquet
to
allow
him
a
pension
and
will
go
and
compose
verses
at
fontainebleau
upon
some
mancini
or
other
whose
eyes
the
queen
will
scratch
out
she
is
a
spaniard
you
see
this
queen
of
ours
and
she
has
for
madame
anne
of
austria
i
know
something
of
the
spaniards
of
the
house
of
austria
and
next
well
after
having
torn
the
silver
lace
from
the
uniforms
of
his
swiss
because
lace
is
too
expensive
he
will
dismount
his
musketeers
because
oats
and
hay
of
a
horse
cost
five
sols
a
day
oh
do
not
say
that
of
what
consequence
is
it
to
me
i
am
no
longer
a
musketeer
am
i
let
them
be
on
horseback
let
them
be
on
foot
let
them
carry
a
a
spit
a
sword
or
nothing
what
is
it
to
me
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
beseech
you
speak
no
more
ill
of
the
king
i
am
almost
in
his
service
and
my
father
would
be
very
angry
with
me
for
having
heard
even
from
your
mouth
words
injurious
to
his
majesty
your
father
eh
he
is
a
knight
in
every
bad
cause
pardieu
yes
your
father
is
a
brave
man
a
caesar
it
is
true
but
a
man
without
perception
now
my
dear
chevalier
exclaimed
raoul
laughing
are
you
going
to
speak
ill
of
my
father
of
him
you
call
the
great
athos
truly
you
are
in
a
bad
vein
riches
render
you
as
sour
as
poverty
renders
other
people
pardieu
you
are
right
i
am
a
rascal
and
in
my
dotage
i
am
an
unhappy
wretch
grown
old
a
untwisted
a
pierced
cuirass
a
boot
without
a
sole
a
spur
without
a
rowel
but
do
me
the
pleasure
to
add
one
thing
what
is
that
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
simply
say
mazarin
was
a
pitiful
perhaps
he
is
dead
more
the
reason
i
say
was
if
i
did
not
hope
that
he
was
dead
i
would
entreat
you
to
say
mazarin
is
a
pitiful
come
say
so
say
so
for
love
of
me
well
i
will
say
it
mazarin
was
a
pitiful
wretch
said
raoul
smiling
at
the
musketeer
who
roared
with
laughter
as
in
his
best
days
a
moment
said
the
latter
you
have
spoken
my
first
proposition
here
is
the
conclusion
of
it
repeat
raoul
repeat
but
i
regret
chevalier
you
will
not
say
it
well
then
i
will
say
it
twice
for
you
but
you
would
regret
mazarin
and
they
were
still
laughing
and
discussing
this
profession
of
principles
when
one
of
the
entered
a
letter
monsieur
said
he
for
m
d
artagnan
thank
you
give
it
me
cried
the
musketeer
the
handwriting
of
monsieur
le
comte
said
raoul
yes
yes
and
d
artagnan
broke
the
seal
dear
friend
said
athos
a
person
has
just
been
here
to
beg
me
to
seek
for
you
on
the
part
of
the
king
seek
me
said
d
artagnan
letting
the
paper
fall
upon
the
table
raoul
picked
it
up
and
continued
to
read
aloud
make
haste
his
majesty
is
very
anxious
to
speak
to
you
and
expects
you
at
the
louvre
expects
me
again
repeated
the
musketeer
he
he
he
laughed
raoul
oh
oh
replied
d
artagnan
what
the
devil
can
this
mean
chapter
liii
the
king
the
first
moment
of
surprise
over
d
artagnan
reperused
athos
s
note
it
is
strange
said
he
that
the
king
should
send
for
me
why
so
said
raoul
do
you
not
think
monsieur
that
the
king
must
regret
such
a
servant
as
you
oh
oh
cried
the
officer
laughing
with
all
his
might
you
are
poking
fun
at
me
master
raoul
if
the
king
had
regretted
me
he
would
not
have
let
me
leave
him
no
no
i
see
in
it
something
better
or
worse
if
you
like
worse
what
can
that
be
monsieur
le
chevalier
you
are
young
you
are
a
boy
you
are
admirable
oh
how
i
should
like
to
be
as
you
are
to
be
but
with
an
unfortunate
brow
under
which
the
brain
is
void
of
everything
but
women
love
and
good
intentions
oh
raoul
as
long
as
you
have
not
received
the
smiles
of
kings
the
confidence
of
queens
as
long
as
you
have
not
had
two
cardinals
killed
under
you
the
one
a
tiger
the
other
a
fox
as
long
as
you
have
not
but
what
is
the
good
of
all
this
trifling
we
must
part
raoul
how
you
say
the
word
what
a
serious
face
eh
but
the
occasion
is
worthy
of
it
listen
to
me
i
have
a
very
good
recommendation
to
tender
you
i
am
all
attention
monsieur
d
artagnan
you
will
go
and
inform
your
father
of
my
departure
your
departure
pardieu
you
will
tell
him
i
am
gone
into
england
and
that
i
am
living
in
my
little
in
england
you
and
the
king
s
orders
you
get
more
and
more
silly
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
the
louvre
to
place
myself
at
the
disposal
of
that
little
crowned
the
king
a
why
monsieur
le
chevalier
you
are
mad
on
the
contrary
i
never
was
so
sane
you
do
not
know
what
he
wants
to
do
with
me
this
worthy
son
of
louis
le
juste
but
mordioux
that
is
policy
he
wishes
to
ensconce
me
snugly
in
the
bastile
purely
and
simply
look
you
what
for
cried
raoul
terrified
at
what
he
heard
on
account
of
what
i
told
him
one
day
at
blois
i
was
warm
he
remembers
it
you
told
him
what
that
he
was
mean
cowardly
and
silly
good
god
cried
raoul
is
it
possible
that
such
words
should
have
issued
from
your
mouth
perhaps
i
don
t
give
the
letter
of
my
speech
but
i
give
the
sense
of
it
but
did
not
the
king
have
you
arrested
immediately
by
whom
it
was
i
who
commanded
the
musketeers
he
must
have
commanded
me
to
convey
myself
to
prison
i
would
never
have
consented
i
would
have
resisted
myself
and
then
i
went
into
england
no
more
d
artagnan
now
the
cardinal
is
dead
or
nearly
so
they
learn
that
i
am
in
paris
and
they
lay
their
hands
on
me
the
cardinal
was
your
protector
the
cardinal
knew
me
he
knew
certain
particularities
of
me
i
also
knew
some
of
his
we
appreciated
each
other
mutually
and
then
on
rendering
his
soul
to
the
devil
he
would
recommend
anne
of
austria
to
make
me
the
inhabitant
of
a
safe
place
go
then
and
find
your
father
relate
the
fact
to
him
and
adieu
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
raoul
very
much
agitated
after
having
looked
out
the
window
you
can
not
even
fly
why
not
because
there
is
below
an
officer
of
the
swiss
guards
waiting
for
you
well
well
he
will
arrest
you
d
artagnan
broke
into
a
homeric
laugh
oh
i
know
very
well
that
you
will
resist
that
you
will
fight
even
i
know
very
well
that
you
will
prove
the
conqueror
but
that
amounts
to
rebellion
and
you
are
an
officer
yourself
knowing
what
discipline
is
devil
of
a
boy
how
logical
that
is
grumbled
d
artagnan
you
approve
of
it
do
you
not
yes
instead
of
passing
into
the
street
where
that
idiot
is
waiting
for
me
i
will
slip
quietly
out
at
the
back
i
have
a
horse
in
the
stable
and
a
good
one
i
will
ride
him
to
death
my
means
permit
me
to
do
so
and
by
killing
one
horse
after
another
i
shall
arrive
at
boulogne
in
eleven
hours
i
know
the
road
only
tell
your
father
one
thing
what
is
that
that
is
that
the
thing
he
knows
about
is
placed
at
planchet
s
house
except
a
fifth
and
that
but
my
dear
d
artagnan
rest
assured
that
if
you
fly
two
things
will
be
said
of
you
what
are
they
my
dear
friend
the
first
that
you
have
been
afraid
ah
and
who
will
dare
to
say
that
the
king
first
well
but
he
will
tell
the
truth
i
am
afraid
the
second
that
you
knew
yourself
guilty
guilty
of
what
why
of
the
crimes
they
wish
to
impute
to
you
that
is
true
again
so
then
you
advise
me
to
go
and
get
myself
made
a
prisoner
in
the
bastile
le
comte
de
la
fere
would
advise
you
just
as
i
do
pardieu
i
know
he
would
said
d
artagnan
thoughtfully
you
are
right
i
shall
not
escape
but
if
they
cast
me
into
the
bastile
we
will
get
you
out
again
said
raoul
with
a
quiet
calm
air
mordioux
you
said
that
after
a
brave
fashion
raoul
said
d
artagnan
seizing
his
hand
that
savors
of
athos
distinctly
well
i
will
go
then
do
not
forget
my
last
word
except
a
fifth
said
raoul
yes
you
are
a
fine
boy
and
i
wish
you
to
add
one
thing
to
that
last
word
speak
chevalier
it
is
that
if
you
can
not
get
me
out
of
the
bastile
and
i
remain
there
oh
that
will
be
so
and
i
shall
be
a
detestable
prisoner
i
who
have
been
a
passable
man
in
that
case
i
give
to
you
and
the
fourth
to
your
father
chevalier
mordioux
if
you
will
have
some
masses
said
for
me
you
are
welcome
that
being
said
d
artagnan
took
his
belt
from
the
hook
girded
on
his
sword
took
a
hat
the
feather
of
which
was
fresh
and
held
his
hand
out
to
raoul
who
threw
himself
into
his
arms
when
in
the
shop
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
the
who
looked
upon
the
scene
with
a
pride
mingled
with
some
inquietude
then
plunging
his
hands
into
a
chest
of
currants
he
went
straight
to
the
officer
who
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
those
features
can
it
be
you
monsieur
de
friedisch
cried
d
artagnan
gayly
eh
eh
what
do
we
arrest
our
friends
arrest
whispered
the
lads
among
themselves
ja
it
is
i
monsieur
d
artagnan
to
you
said
the
swiss
in
his
mountain
patois
must
i
give
you
up
my
sword
i
warn
you
that
it
is
long
and
heavy
you
had
better
let
me
wear
if
to
the
louvre
i
feel
quite
lost
in
the
streets
without
a
sword
and
you
would
be
more
at
a
loss
that
i
should
with
two
the
king
has
given
me
no
orders
about
it
replied
the
swiss
so
keep
your
sword
well
that
is
very
polite
on
the
part
of
the
king
let
us
go
at
once
monsieur
friedisch
was
not
a
talker
and
d
artagnan
had
too
many
things
to
think
about
to
say
much
from
planchet
s
shop
to
the
louvre
was
not
far
they
arrived
in
ten
minutes
it
was
a
dark
night
de
friedisch
wanted
to
enter
by
the
wicket
no
said
d
artagnan
you
would
lose
time
by
that
take
the
little
staircase
the
swiss
did
as
d
artagnan
advised
and
conducted
him
to
the
vestibule
of
the
king
s
cabinet
when
arrived
there
he
bowed
to
his
prisoner
and
without
saying
anything
returned
to
his
post
d
artagnan
had
not
had
time
to
ask
why
his
sword
was
not
taken
from
him
when
the
door
of
the
cabinet
opened
and
a
valet
de
chambre
called
m
d
artagnan
the
musketeer
assumed
his
parade
carriage
and
entered
with
his
large
eyes
wide
open
his
brow
calm
his
moustache
stiff
the
king
was
seated
at
a
table
writing
he
did
not
disturb
himself
when
the
step
of
the
musketeer
resounded
on
the
floor
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
d
artagnan
advanced
as
far
as
the
middle
of
the
room
and
seeing
that
the
king
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
suspecting
besides
that
this
was
nothing
but
affectation
a
sort
of
tormenting
preamble
to
the
explanation
that
was
preparing
he
turned
his
back
on
the
prince
and
began
to
examine
the
frescoes
on
the
cornices
and
the
cracks
in
the
ceiling
this
maneuver
was
accompanied
by
a
little
tacit
monologue
ah
you
want
to
humble
me
do
you
you
whom
i
have
seen
so
young
you
whom
i
have
saved
as
i
would
my
own
child
you
whom
i
have
served
as
i
would
a
god
that
is
to
say
for
nothing
wait
awhile
wait
awhile
you
shall
see
what
a
man
can
do
who
has
suffered
the
air
of
the
fire
of
the
huguenots
under
the
beard
of
monsieur
le
cardinal
the
true
cardinal
at
this
moment
louis
turned
round
ah
are
you
there
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
he
d
artagnan
saw
the
movement
and
imitated
it
yes
sire
said
he
very
well
have
the
goodness
to
wait
till
i
have
cast
this
up
d
artagnan
made
no
reply
he
only
bowed
that
is
polite
enough
thought
he
i
have
nothing
to
say
louis
made
a
violent
dash
with
his
pen
and
threw
it
angrily
away
ah
go
on
work
yourself
up
thought
the
musketeer
you
will
put
me
at
my
ease
you
shall
find
i
did
not
empty
the
bag
the
other
day
at
blois
louis
rose
from
his
seat
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
then
stopping
opposite
to
d
artagnan
he
looked
at
him
with
an
air
at
once
imperious
and
kind
what
the
devil
does
he
want
with
me
i
wish
he
would
begin
thought
the
musketeer
monsieur
said
the
king
you
know
without
doubt
that
monsieur
le
cardinal
is
dead
i
suspected
so
sire
you
know
that
consequently
i
am
master
in
my
own
kingdom
that
is
not
a
thing
that
dates
from
the
death
of
monsieur
le
cardinal
sire
a
man
is
always
master
in
his
own
house
when
he
wishes
to
be
so
yes
but
do
you
not
remember
all
you
said
to
me
at
blois
now
we
come
to
it
thought
d
artagnan
i
was
not
deceived
well
so
much
the
better
it
is
a
sign
that
my
scent
is
tolerably
keen
yet
you
do
not
answer
me
said
louis
sire
i
think
i
recollect
you
only
think
it
is
so
long
ago
if
you
do
not
remember
i
do
you
said
to
me
listen
with
attention
ah
i
shall
listen
with
all
my
ears
sire
for
it
is
very
likely
the
conversation
will
turn
in
a
fashion
very
interesting
to
me
louis
once
more
looked
at
the
musketeer
the
latter
smoothed
the
feather
of
his
hat
then
his
mustache
and
waited
bravely
louis
xiv
continued
you
quitted
my
service
monsieur
after
having
told
me
the
whole
truth
yes
sire
that
is
after
having
declared
to
me
all
you
thought
to
be
true
with
regard
to
my
mode
of
thinking
and
acting
that
is
always
a
merit
you
began
by
telling
me
that
you
had
served
my
family
thirty
years
and
were
fatigued
i
said
so
yes
sire
and
you
afterwards
admitted
that
that
fatigue
was
a
pretext
and
that
discontent
was
the
real
cause
i
was
discontented
in
fact
but
that
discontent
has
never
betrayed
itself
that
i
know
of
and
if
like
a
man
of
heart
i
have
spoken
out
before
your
majesty
i
have
not
even
thought
of
the
matter
before
anybody
else
do
not
excuse
yourself
d
artagnan
but
continue
to
listen
to
me
when
making
me
the
reproach
that
you
were
discontented
you
received
in
reply
a
promise
is
that
not
true
yes
sire
as
true
as
what
i
told
you
you
answered
me
hereafter
no
now
do
not
excuse
yourself
i
tell
you
it
was
natural
but
you
had
no
charity
for
your
poor
prince
monsieur
d
artagnan
sire
charity
for
a
king
on
the
part
of
a
poor
soldier
you
understand
me
very
well
you
knew
that
i
stood
in
need
of
it
you
knew
very
well
that
i
was
not
master
you
knew
very
well
that
my
hope
was
in
the
future
now
you
answered
me
when
i
spoke
of
the
future
my
discharge
and
that
that
is
true
murmured
d
artagnan
biting
his
mustache
you
did
not
flatter
me
when
i
was
in
distress
added
louis
but
said
d
artagnan
raising
his
head
nobly
if
i
did
not
flatter
your
majesty
when
poor
neither
did
i
betray
you
i
have
shed
my
blood
for
nothing
i
have
watched
like
a
dog
at
a
door
knowing
full
well
that
neither
bread
nor
bone
would
be
thrown
to
me
i
although
poor
likewise
asked
nothing
of
your
majesty
but
the
discharge
you
speak
of
i
know
you
are
a
brave
man
but
i
was
a
young
man
and
you
ought
to
have
had
some
indulgence
for
me
what
had
you
to
reproach
the
king
with
that
he
left
king
charles
ii
without
assistance
let
us
say
further
that
he
did
not
marry
mademoiselle
de
mancini
when
saying
these
words
the
king
fixed
upon
the
musketeer
a
searching
look
ah
ah
thought
the
latter
he
is
doing
far
more
than
remembering
he
divines
the
devil
your
sentence
continued
louis
fell
upon
the
king
and
fell
upon
the
man
but
monsieur
d
artagnan
that
weakness
for
you
considered
it
a
weakness
d
artagnan
made
no
reply
you
reproached
me
also
with
regard
to
monsieur
the
defunct
cardinal
now
monsieur
le
cardinal
did
he
not
bring
me
up
did
he
not
support
me
elevating
himself
and
supporting
himself
at
the
same
time
i
admit
but
the
benefit
was
discharged
as
an
ingrate
or
an
egotist
would
you
then
have
better
loved
or
served
me
sire
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
monsieur
it
would
only
create
in
you
too
many
regrets
and
me
too
much
pain
d
artagnan
was
not
convinced
the
young
king
in
adopting
a
tone
of
hauteur
with
him
did
not
forward
his
purpose
you
have
since
reflected
resumed
louis
upon
what
sire
asked
d
artagnan
politely
why
upon
all
that
i
have
said
to
you
monsieur
yes
sire
no
doubt
and
you
have
only
waited
for
an
opportunity
of
retracting
your
words
sire
you
hesitate
it
seems
i
do
not
understand
what
your
majesty
did
me
the
honor
to
say
to
me
louis
s
brow
became
cloudy
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
me
sire
my
understanding
is
particularly
thick
things
do
not
penetrate
it
without
difficulty
but
it
is
true
once
they
get
in
they
remain
there
yes
yes
you
appear
to
have
a
memory
almost
as
good
a
one
as
your
majesty
s
then
give
me
quickly
one
solution
my
time
is
valuable
what
have
you
been
doing
since
your
discharge
making
my
fortune
sire
the
expression
is
crude
monsieur
d
artagnan
your
majesty
takes
it
in
bad
part
certainly
i
entertain
nothing
but
the
profoundest
respect
for
the
king
and
if
i
have
been
impolite
which
might
be
excused
by
my
long
sojourn
in
camps
and
barracks
your
majesty
is
too
much
above
me
to
be
offended
at
a
word
that
innocently
escapes
from
a
soldier
in
fact
i
know
you
performed
a
brilliant
action
in
england
monsieur
i
only
regret
that
you
have
broken
your
promise
i
cried
d
artagnan
doubtless
you
engaged
your
word
not
to
serve
any
other
prince
on
quitting
my
service
now
it
was
for
king
charles
ii
that
you
undertook
the
marvelous
carrying
off
of
m
monk
pardon
me
sire
it
was
for
myself
and
did
you
succeed
like
the
captains
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
adventures
what
do
you
call
succeeding
a
fortune
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
sire
which
i
now
possess
that
is
in
one
week
three
times
as
much
money
as
i
ever
had
in
fifty
years
it
is
a
handsome
sum
but
you
are
ambitious
i
perceive
i
sire
the
quarter
of
that
would
be
a
treasure
and
i
swear
to
you
i
have
no
thought
of
augmenting
it
what
you
contemplate
remaining
idle
yes
sire
you
mean
to
drop
the
sword
that
i
have
already
done
impossible
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
louis
firmly
but
sire
well
and
why
sire
because
it
is
my
wish
you
should
not
said
the
young
prince
in
a
voice
so
stern
and
imperious
that
d
artagnan
evinced
surprise
and
even
uneasiness
will
your
majesty
allow
me
one
word
of
reply
said
he
speak
i
formed
that
resolution
when
i
was
poor
and
destitute
so
be
it
go
on
now
when
by
my
energy
i
have
acquired
a
comfortable
means
of
subsistence
would
your
majesty
despoil
me
of
my
liberty
your
majesty
would
condemn
me
to
the
lowest
when
i
have
gained
the
highest
who
gave
you
permission
monsieur
to
fathom
my
designs
or
to
reckon
with
me
replied
louis
in
a
voice
almost
angry
who
told
you
what
i
shall
do
or
what
you
will
yourself
do
sire
said
the
musketeer
quietly
as
far
as
i
see
freedom
is
not
the
order
of
the
conversation
as
it
was
on
the
day
we
came
to
an
explanation
at
blois
no
monsieur
everything
is
changed
i
tender
your
majesty
my
sincere
compliments
upon
that
but
but
you
don
t
believe
it
i
am
not
a
great
statesman
and
yet
i
have
my
eye
upon
affairs
it
seldom
fails
now
i
do
not
see
exactly
as
your
majesty
does
sire
the
reign
of
mazarin
is
over
but
that
of
the
financiers
is
begun
they
have
the
money
your
majesty
will
not
often
see
much
of
it
to
live
under
the
paw
of
these
hungry
wolves
is
hard
for
a
man
who
reckoned
upon
independence
at
this
moment
someone
scratched
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
the
king
raised
his
head
proudly
your
pardon
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
he
it
is
colbert
who
comes
to
make
me
a
report
come
in
m
colbert
d
artagnan
drew
back
colbert
entered
with
papers
in
his
hand
and
went
up
to
the
king
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
gascon
did
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
applying
his
keen
quick
glance
to
the
new
figure
which
presented
itself
is
the
inquiry
made
yes
sire
and
the
opinion
of
the
inquisitors
is
that
the
accused
merit
confiscation
and
death
ah
ah
said
the
king
without
changing
countenance
and
casting
an
oblique
look
at
d
artagnan
and
your
own
opinion
m
colbert
said
he
colbert
looked
at
d
artagnan
is
his
turn
that
imposing
countenance
checked
the
words
upon
his
lips
louis
perceived
this
do
not
disturb
yourself
said
he
it
is
d
artagnan
do
you
not
know
d
artagnan
again
these
two
men
looked
at
each
other
d
artagnan
with
eyes
open
and
bright
as
the
day
colbert
with
his
half
closed
and
dim
the
frank
intrepidity
of
the
financier
annoyed
the
other
the
circumspection
of
the
financier
disgusted
the
soldier
ah
ah
this
is
the
gentleman
who
made
that
brilliant
stroke
in
england
said
colbert
and
he
bowed
slightly
to
d
artagnan
ah
ah
said
the
gascon
this
is
the
gentleman
who
clipped
off
the
lace
from
the
uniform
of
the
swiss
a
praiseworthy
piece
of
economy
the
financier
thought
to
pierce
the
musketeer
but
the
musketeer
ran
the
financier
through
monsieur
d
artagnan
resumed
the
king
who
had
not
remarked
all
the
shades
of
which
mazarin
would
have
missed
not
one
this
concerns
the
farmers
of
the
revenue
who
have
robbed
me
whom
i
am
hanging
and
whose
i
am
about
to
sign
oh
oh
said
d
artagnan
starting
what
did
you
say
oh
nothing
sire
this
is
no
business
of
mine
the
king
had
already
taken
up
the
pen
and
was
applying
it
to
the
paper
sire
said
colbert
in
a
subdued
voice
i
beg
to
warn
your
majesty
that
if
an
example
be
necessary
there
will
be
difficulty
in
the
execution
of
your
orders
what
do
you
say
said
louis
you
must
not
conceal
from
yourself
continued
colbert
quietly
that
attacking
the
is
attacking
the
superintendence
the
two
unfortunate
guilty
men
in
question
are
the
particular
friends
of
a
powerful
personage
and
the
punishment
which
otherwise
might
be
comfortably
confined
to
the
chatlet
will
doubtless
be
a
signal
for
disturbances
louis
colored
and
turned
towards
d
artagnan
who
took
a
slight
bite
at
his
mustache
not
without
a
smile
of
pity
for
the
financier
and
for
the
king
who
had
to
listen
to
him
so
long
but
louis
seized
the
pen
and
with
a
movement
so
rapid
that
his
hand
shook
he
affixed
his
signature
at
the
bottom
of
the
two
papers
presented
by
colbert
then
looking
the
latter
in
the
face
monsieur
colbert
said
he
when
you
speak
to
me
on
business
exclude
more
frequently
the
word
difficulty
from
your
reasonings
and
opinions
as
to
the
word
impossibility
never
pronounce
it
colbert
bowed
much
humiliated
at
having
to
undergo
such
a
lesson
before
the
musketeer
he
was
about
to
go
out
but
jealous
to
repair
his
check
i
forgot
to
announce
to
your
majesty
said
he
that
the
confiscations
amount
to
the
sum
of
five
millions
of
livres
that
s
pretty
well
thought
d
artagnan
which
makes
in
my
coffers
said
the
king
eighteen
millions
of
livres
sire
replied
colbert
bowing
mordioux
growled
d
artagnan
that
s
glorious
monsieur
colbert
added
the
king
you
will
if
you
please
go
through
the
gallery
where
lyonne
is
waiting
and
will
tell
him
to
bring
hither
what
he
has
drawn
up
by
my
order
directly
sire
if
your
majesty
wants
me
no
more
this
evening
no
monsieur
and
colbert
went
out
now
let
us
return
to
our
affair
d
artagnan
said
the
king
as
if
nothing
had
happened
you
see
that
with
respect
to
money
there
is
already
a
notable
change
something
to
the
tune
of
from
zero
to
eighteen
millions
replied
the
musketeer
gayly
ah
that
was
what
your
majesty
wanted
the
day
king
charles
ii
came
to
blois
the
two
states
would
not
have
been
embroiled
for
i
must
say
that
there
also
i
see
another
well
in
the
first
place
replied
louis
you
are
unjust
monsieur
for
if
providence
had
made
me
able
to
give
my
brother
the
million
that
day
you
would
not
have
quitted
my
service
and
consequently
you
would
not
have
made
your
fortune
as
you
told
me
just
now
you
have
done
but
in
addition
to
this
i
have
had
another
piece
of
good
fortune
and
my
difference
with
great
britain
need
not
alarm
you
a
valet
de
chambre
interrupted
the
king
by
announcing
lyonne
come
in
monsieur
said
the
king
you
are
punctual
that
is
like
a
good
servant
let
us
see
your
letter
to
my
brother
charles
ii
d
artagnan
pricked
up
his
ears
a
moment
monsieur
said
louis
carelessly
to
the
gascon
i
must
expedite
to
london
my
consent
to
the
marriage
of
my
brother
le
duc
d
anjou
with
the
princess
henrietta
stuart
he
is
knocking
me
about
it
seems
murmured
d
artagnan
whilst
the
king
signed
the
letter
and
dismissed
de
lyonne
but
ma
foi
the
more
he
knocks
me
about
in
this
manner
the
better
i
like
it
the
king
followed
de
lyonne
with
his
eyes
till
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
he
even
made
three
steps
as
if
he
would
follow
the
minister
but
after
these
three
steps
stopping
passing
and
coming
back
to
the
musketeer
now
monsieur
said
he
let
us
hasten
to
terminate
our
affair
you
told
me
the
other
day
at
blois
that
you
were
not
rich
but
i
am
now
sire
yes
but
that
does
not
concern
me
you
have
your
own
money
not
mine
that
does
not
enter
into
my
account
i
do
not
well
understand
what
your
majesty
means
then
instead
of
leaving
you
to
draw
out
words
speak
spontaneously
should
you
be
satisfied
with
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
as
a
fixed
income
but
sire
said
d
artagnan
opening
his
eyes
to
the
utmost
would
you
be
satisfied
with
four
horses
furnished
and
kept
and
with
a
supplement
of
funds
such
as
you
might
require
according
to
occasions
and
needs
or
would
you
prefer
a
fixed
sum
which
would
be
for
example
forty
thousand
livres
answer
sire
your
majesty
yes
you
are
surprised
that
is
natural
and
i
expected
it
answer
me
come
or
i
shall
think
you
have
no
longer
that
rapidity
of
judgment
i
have
so
much
admired
in
you
it
is
certain
sire
that
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
make
a
handsome
sum
but
no
buts
yes
or
no
is
it
an
honorable
indemnity
oh
very
certainly
you
will
be
satisfied
with
it
that
is
well
it
will
be
better
to
reckon
the
extra
expenses
separately
you
can
arrange
that
with
colbert
now
let
us
pass
to
something
more
important
but
sire
i
told
your
majesty
that
you
wanted
rest
i
know
you
did
only
i
replied
that
i
would
not
allow
it
i
am
master
i
suppose
yes
sire
that
is
well
you
were
formerly
in
the
way
of
becoming
captain
of
the
musketeers
yes
sire
well
here
is
your
commission
signed
i
place
it
in
this
drawer
the
day
on
which
you
return
from
a
certain
expedition
which
i
have
to
confide
to
you
on
that
day
you
may
yourself
take
the
commission
from
the
drawer
d
artagnan
still
hesitated
and
hung
down
his
head
come
monsieur
said
the
king
one
would
believe
to
look
at
you
that
you
did
not
know
that
at
the
court
of
the
most
christian
king
the
of
the
musketeers
takes
precedence
of
the
marechals
of
france
sire
i
know
he
does
then
am
i
to
think
you
do
put
no
faith
in
my
word
oh
sire
never
never
dream
of
such
a
thing
i
have
wished
to
prove
to
you
that
you
so
good
a
servant
had
lost
a
good
master
am
i
anything
like
the
master
that
will
suit
you
i
begin
to
think
you
are
sire
then
monsieur
you
will
resume
your
functions
your
company
is
quite
disorganized
since
your
departure
and
the
men
go
about
drinking
and
rioting
in
the
cabarets
where
they
fight
in
spite
of
my
edicts
and
those
of
my
father
you
will
reorganize
the
service
as
soon
as
possible
yes
sire
you
will
not
again
quit
my
person
very
well
sire
you
will
march
with
me
to
the
army
you
will
encamp
round
my
tent
then
sire
said
d
artagnan
if
it
is
only
to
impose
upon
me
a
service
like
that
your
majesty
need
not
give
me
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
i
shall
not
earn
them
i
desire
that
you
shall
keep
open
house
i
desire
that
you
should
keep
a
liberal
table
i
desire
that
my
captain
of
musketeers
should
be
a
personage
and
i
said
d
artagnan
bluntly
i
do
not
like
easily
found
money
i
like
money
won
your
majesty
gives
me
an
idle
trade
which
the
first
comer
would
perform
for
four
thousand
livres
louis
xiv
began
to
laugh
you
are
a
true
gascon
monsieur
d
artagnan
you
will
draw
my
heart
s
secret
from
me
bah
has
your
majesty
a
secret
then
yes
monsieur
well
then
i
accept
the
twenty
thousand
livres
for
i
will
keep
that
secret
and
discretion
is
above
all
price
in
these
times
will
your
majesty
speak
now
boot
yourself
monsieur
d
artagnan
and
to
horse
directly
sire
within
two
days
that
is
well
sire
for
i
have
my
affairs
to
settle
before
i
set
out
particularly
if
it
is
likely
there
should
be
any
blows
stirring
that
may
happen
we
can
receive
them
but
sire
you
have
addressed
yourself
to
avarice
to
ambition
you
have
addressed
yourself
to
the
heart
of
d
artagnan
but
you
have
forgotten
one
thing
what
is
that
you
have
said
nothing
to
his
vanity
when
shall
i
be
a
knight
of
the
king
s
orders
does
that
interest
you
why
yes
sire
my
friend
athos
is
quite
covered
with
orders
and
that
dazzles
me
you
shall
be
a
knight
of
my
order
a
month
after
you
have
taken
your
commission
of
captain
ah
ah
said
the
officer
thoughtfully
after
the
expedition
precisely
where
is
your
majesty
going
to
send
me
are
you
acquainted
with
bretagne
no
sire
have
you
any
friends
there
in
bretagne
no
ma
foi
so
much
the
better
do
you
know
anything
about
fortifications
i
believe
i
do
sire
said
d
artagnan
smiling
that
is
to
say
you
can
readily
distinguish
a
fortress
from
a
simple
fortification
such
as
is
allowed
to
chatelains
or
vassals
i
distinguish
a
fort
from
a
rampart
as
i
distinguish
a
cuirass
from
a
raised
sire
is
that
sufficient
yes
monsieur
you
will
set
out
then
for
bretagne
yes
alone
absolutely
alone
that
is
to
say
you
must
not
even
take
a
lackey
with
you
may
i
ask
your
majesty
for
what
reason
because
monsieur
it
will
be
necessary
to
disguise
yourself
sometimes
as
the
servant
of
a
good
family
your
face
is
very
well
known
in
france
m
d
artagnan
and
then
sire
and
then
you
will
travel
slowly
through
bretagne
and
will
examine
the
fortifications
of
that
country
the
coasts
yes
and
the
isles
commencing
by
ah
which
belongs
to
m
fouquet
said
d
artagnan
in
a
serious
tone
raising
his
intelligent
eye
to
louis
xiv
i
fancy
you
are
right
monsieur
and
that
does
belong
to
fouquet
in
fact
then
your
majesty
wishes
me
to
ascertain
if
is
a
strong
place
yes
if
the
fortifications
of
it
are
new
or
old
precisely
and
if
the
vassals
of
fouquet
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
form
a
garrison
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
you
have
placed
your
finger
on
the
question
and
if
they
are
not
fortifying
sire
you
will
travel
about
bretagne
listening
and
judging
then
i
am
a
king
s
spy
said
d
artagnan
bluntly
twisting
his
mustache
no
monsieur
your
pardon
sire
i
spy
on
your
majesty
s
account
you
start
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
monsieur
would
you
march
at
the
head
of
your
musketeers
with
your
sword
in
your
hand
to
observe
any
spot
whatever
or
an
enemy
s
position
at
this
word
d
artagnan
started
do
you
continued
the
king
imagine
yourself
to
be
a
spy
no
no
said
d
artagnan
but
pensively
the
thing
changes
its
face
when
one
observes
an
enemy
one
is
but
a
soldier
and
if
they
are
fortifying
added
he
quickly
you
will
take
an
exact
plan
of
the
fortifications
will
they
permit
me
to
enter
that
does
not
concern
me
that
is
your
affair
did
you
not
understand
that
i
reserved
for
you
a
supplement
of
twenty
thousand
livres
per
annum
if
you
wished
it
yes
sire
but
if
they
are
not
fortifying
you
will
return
quietly
without
fatiguing
your
horse
sire
i
am
ready
you
will
begin
by
going
to
monsieur
le
surintendant
s
to
take
the
first
quarter
of
the
pension
i
give
you
do
you
know
m
fouquet
very
little
sire
but
i
beg
your
majesty
to
observe
that
i
don
t
think
it
immediately
necessary
that
i
should
know
him
your
pardon
monsieur
for
he
will
refuse
you
the
money
i
wish
you
to
take
and
it
is
that
refusal
i
look
for
ah
said
d
artagnan
then
sire
the
money
being
refused
you
will
go
and
seek
it
at
colbert
s
a
propos
have
you
a
good
horse
an
excellent
one
sire
how
much
did
it
cost
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
pistoles
i
will
buy
it
of
you
here
is
a
note
for
two
hundred
pistoles
but
i
want
a
horse
for
my
journey
sire
well
well
and
you
take
mine
from
me
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
give
it
you
only
as
it
is
now
mine
and
not
yours
i
am
sure
you
will
not
spare
it
your
majesty
is
in
a
hurry
then
a
great
hurry
then
what
compels
me
to
wait
two
days
reasons
known
to
myself
that
s
a
different
affair
the
horse
may
make
up
the
two
days
in
the
eight
he
has
to
travel
and
then
there
is
the
post
no
no
the
post
compromises
monsieur
d
artagnan
begone
and
do
not
forget
you
are
my
servant
sire
it
is
not
my
duty
to
forget
it
at
what
hour
shall
i
take
my
leave
of
your
majesty
whence
do
you
lodge
i
must
henceforward
lodge
at
the
louvre
that
must
not
be
now
keep
your
lodgings
in
the
city
i
will
pay
for
them
as
to
your
departure
it
must
take
place
at
night
you
must
set
out
without
being
seen
by
any
one
or
if
you
are
seen
it
must
not
be
known
that
you
belong
to
me
keep
your
mouth
shut
monsieur
your
majesty
spoils
all
you
have
said
by
that
single
word
i
asked
where
you
lodged
for
i
can
not
always
send
to
le
comte
de
la
fere
to
seek
you
i
lodge
with
planchet
a
grocer
rue
des
lombards
at
the
sign
of
the
pilon
d
or
go
out
but
little
show
yourself
less
and
await
my
orders
and
yet
sire
i
must
go
for
the
money
that
is
true
but
when
going
to
the
superintendence
where
so
many
people
are
constantly
going
you
must
mingle
with
the
crowd
i
want
the
notes
sire
for
the
money
here
they
are
the
king
signed
them
and
d
artagnan
looked
on
to
assure
himself
of
their
regularity
adieu
monsieur
d
artagnan
added
the
king
i
think
you
have
perfectly
understood
me
i
i
understand
that
your
majesty
sends
me
to
that
is
all
to
learn
to
learn
how
fouquet
s
works
are
going
on
that
is
all
very
well
i
admit
you
may
be
taken
and
i
do
not
admit
it
replied
the
gascon
boldly
i
admit
you
may
be
killed
continued
the
king
that
is
not
probable
sire
in
the
first
case
you
must
not
speak
in
the
second
there
must
be
no
papers
found
upon
you
d
artagnan
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
ceremony
and
took
leave
of
the
king
saying
to
himself
the
english
shower
continues
let
us
remain
under
the
spout
chapter
liv
the
houses
of
fouquet
whilst
d
artagnan
was
returning
to
planchet
s
house
his
head
aching
and
bewildered
with
all
that
had
happened
to
him
there
was
passing
a
scene
of
quite
a
different
character
and
which
nevertheless
is
not
foreign
to
the
conversation
our
musketeer
had
just
had
with
the
king
only
this
scene
took
place
out
of
paris
in
a
house
possessed
by
the
superintendent
fouquet
in
the
village
of
the
minister
had
just
arrived
at
this
followed
by
his
principal
clerk
who
carried
an
enormous
portfolio
full
of
papers
to
be
examined
and
others
waiting
for
signature
as
it
might
be
about
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
masters
had
dined
supper
was
being
prepared
for
twenty
subaltern
guests
the
superintendent
did
not
stop
on
alighting
from
his
carriage
he
at
the
same
bound
sprang
through
the
doorway
traversed
the
apartments
and
gained
his
cabinet
where
he
declared
he
would
shut
himself
up
to
work
commanding
that
he
should
not
be
disturbed
for
anything
but
an
order
from
the
king
as
soon
as
this
order
was
given
fouquet
shut
himself
up
and
two
footmen
were
placed
as
sentinels
at
his
door
then
fouquet
pushed
a
bolt
which
displaced
a
panel
that
walled
up
the
entrance
and
prevented
everything
that
passed
in
this
apartment
from
being
either
seen
or
heard
but
against
all
probability
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
shutting
himself
up
that
fouquet
shut
himself
up
thus
for
he
went
straight
to
a
bureau
seated
himself
at
it
opened
the
portfolio
and
began
to
make
a
choice
amongst
the
enormous
mass
of
papers
it
contained
it
was
not
more
than
ten
minutes
after
he
had
entered
and
taken
all
the
precautions
we
have
described
when
the
repeated
noise
of
several
slight
equal
knocks
struck
his
ear
and
appeared
to
fix
his
utmost
attention
fouquet
raised
his
head
turned
his
ear
and
listened
the
strokes
continued
then
the
worker
arose
with
a
slight
movement
of
impatience
and
walked
straight
up
to
a
glass
behind
which
the
blows
were
struck
by
a
hand
or
by
some
invisible
mechanism
it
was
a
large
glass
let
into
a
panel
three
other
glasses
exactly
similar
to
it
completed
the
symmetry
of
the
apartment
nothing
distinguished
that
one
from
the
others
without
doubt
these
reiterated
knocks
were
a
signal
for
at
the
moment
fouquet
approached
the
glass
listening
the
same
noise
was
renewed
and
in
the
same
measure
oh
oh
murmured
the
intendant
with
surprise
who
is
yonder
i
did
not
expect
anybody
and
without
doubt
to
respond
to
the
signal
he
pulled
out
a
gilded
nail
near
the
glass
and
shook
it
thrice
then
returning
to
his
place
and
seating
himself
again
ma
foi
let
them
wait
said
he
and
plunging
again
into
the
ocean
of
papers
unrolled
before
him
he
appeared
to
think
of
nothing
now
but
work
in
fact
with
incredible
rapidity
and
marvelous
lucidity
fouquet
deciphered
the
largest
papers
and
most
complicated
writings
correcting
them
annotating
them
with
a
pen
moved
as
if
by
a
fever
and
the
work
melting
under
his
hands
signatures
figures
references
became
multiplied
as
if
ten
clerks
that
is
to
say
a
hundred
fingers
and
ten
brains
had
performed
the
duties
instead
of
the
five
fingers
and
single
brain
of
this
man
from
time
to
time
only
fouquet
absorbed
by
his
work
raised
his
head
to
cast
a
furtive
glance
upon
a
clock
placed
before
him
the
reason
of
this
was
fouquet
set
himself
a
task
and
when
this
task
was
once
set
in
one
hour
s
work
he
by
himself
did
what
another
would
not
have
accomplished
in
a
day
always
certain
consequently
provided
he
was
not
disturbed
of
arriving
at
the
close
in
the
time
his
devouring
activity
had
fixed
but
in
the
midst
of
his
ardent
labor
the
soft
strokes
upon
the
little
bell
placed
behind
the
glass
sounded
again
hasty
and
consequently
more
urgent
the
lady
appears
to
be
impatient
said
fouquet
humph
a
calm
that
must
be
the
comtesse
but
no
the
comtesse
is
gone
to
rambouillet
for
three
days
the
presidente
then
oh
no
the
presidente
would
not
assume
such
grand
airs
she
would
ring
very
humbly
then
she
would
wait
my
good
pleasure
the
greatest
certainty
is
that
i
do
not
know
who
it
can
be
but
that
i
know
who
it
can
not
be
and
since
it
is
not
you
marquise
since
it
can
not
be
you
deuce
take
the
rest
and
he
went
on
with
his
work
in
spite
of
the
reiterated
appeals
of
the
bell
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
however
impatience
prevailed
over
fouquet
in
his
turn
he
might
be
said
to
consume
rather
than
to
complete
the
rest
of
his
work
he
thrust
his
papers
into
his
portfolio
and
giving
a
glance
at
the
mirror
whilst
the
taps
continued
faster
than
ever
oh
oh
said
he
whence
comes
all
this
racket
what
has
happened
and
who
can
the
ariadne
be
who
expects
me
so
impatiently
let
us
see
he
then
applied
the
tip
of
his
finger
to
the
nail
parallel
to
the
one
he
had
drawn
immediately
the
glass
moved
like
a
and
discovered
a
secret
closet
rather
deep
into
which
the
superintendent
disappeared
as
if
going
into
a
vast
box
when
there
he
touched
another
spring
which
opened
not
a
board
but
a
block
of
the
wall
and
he
went
out
by
that
opening
leaving
the
door
to
shut
of
itself
then
fouquet
descended
about
a
score
of
steps
which
sank
winding
underground
and
came
to
a
long
subterranean
passage
lighted
by
imperceptible
loopholes
the
walls
of
this
vault
were
covered
with
slabs
or
tiles
and
the
floor
with
carpeting
this
passage
was
under
the
street
itself
which
separated
fouquet
s
house
from
the
park
of
vincennes
at
the
end
of
the
passage
ascended
a
winding
staircase
parallel
with
that
by
which
fouquet
had
entered
he
mounted
these
other
stairs
entered
by
means
of
a
spring
placed
in
a
closet
similar
to
that
in
his
cabinet
and
from
this
closet
an
untenanted
chamber
furnished
with
the
utmost
elegance
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
examined
carefully
whether
the
glass
closed
without
leaving
any
trace
and
doubtless
satisfied
with
his
observation
he
opened
by
means
of
a
small
gold
key
the
triple
fastenings
of
a
door
in
front
of
him
this
time
the
door
opened
upon
a
handsome
cabinet
sumptuously
furnished
in
which
was
seated
upon
cushions
a
lady
of
surpassing
beauty
who
at
the
sound
of
the
lock
sprang
towards
fouquet
ah
good
heavens
cried
the
latter
starting
back
with
astonishment
madame
la
marquise
de
belliere
you
here
yes
murmured
la
marquise
yes
it
is
i
monsieur
marquise
dear
marquise
added
fouquet
ready
to
prostrate
himself
ah
my
god
how
did
you
come
here
and
i
to
keep
you
waiting
a
long
time
monsieur
yes
a
very
long
time
i
am
happy
in
thinking
this
waiting
has
appeared
long
to
you
marquise
oh
an
eternity
monsieur
oh
i
rang
more
than
twenty
times
did
you
not
hear
me
marquise
you
are
pale
you
tremble
did
you
not
hear
then
that
you
were
summoned
oh
yes
i
heard
plainly
enough
madame
but
i
could
not
come
after
your
rigors
and
your
refusals
how
could
i
dream
it
was
you
if
i
could
have
had
any
suspicion
of
the
happiness
that
awaited
me
believe
me
madame
i
would
have
quitted
everything
to
fall
at
your
feet
as
i
do
at
this
moment
are
we
quite
alone
monsieur
asked
the
marquise
looking
round
the
room
oh
yes
madame
i
can
assure
you
of
that
really
said
the
marquise
in
a
melancholy
tone
you
sigh
said
fouquet
what
mysteries
what
precautions
said
the
marquise
with
a
slight
bitterness
of
expression
and
how
evident
it
is
that
you
fear
the
least
suspicion
of
your
amours
to
escape
would
you
prefer
their
being
made
public
oh
no
you
act
like
a
delicate
man
said
the
marquise
smiling
come
dear
marquise
punish
me
not
with
reproaches
i
implore
you
reproaches
have
i
a
right
to
make
you
any
no
unfortunately
no
but
tell
me
you
who
during
a
year
i
have
loved
without
return
or
hope
you
are
mistaken
without
hope
it
is
true
but
not
without
return
what
for
me
of
my
love
there
is
but
one
proof
and
that
proof
i
still
want
i
am
here
to
bring
it
monsieur
fouquet
wished
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
but
she
disengaged
herself
with
a
gesture
you
persist
in
deceiving
yourself
monsieur
and
will
never
accept
of
me
the
only
thing
i
am
willing
to
give
you
devotion
ah
then
you
do
not
love
me
devotion
is
but
a
virtue
love
is
a
passion
listen
to
me
i
implore
you
i
should
not
have
come
hither
without
a
serious
motive
you
are
well
assured
of
that
are
you
not
the
motive
is
of
very
little
consequence
so
that
you
are
but
here
so
that
i
see
you
so
that
i
speak
to
you
you
are
right
the
principal
thing
is
that
i
am
here
without
any
one
having
seen
me
and
that
i
can
speak
to
you
fouquet
sank
on
his
knees
before
her
speak
speak
madame
said
he
i
listen
to
you
the
marquise
looked
at
fouquet
on
his
knees
at
her
feet
and
there
was
in
the
looks
of
the
woman
a
strange
mixture
of
love
and
melancholy
oh
at
length
murmured
she
would
that
i
were
she
who
has
the
right
of
seeing
you
every
minute
of
speaking
to
you
every
instant
would
that
i
were
she
who
might
watch
over
you
she
who
would
have
no
need
of
mysterious
springs
to
summon
and
cause
to
appear
like
a
sylph
the
man
she
loves
to
look
at
him
for
an
hour
and
then
see
him
disappear
in
the
darkness
of
a
mystery
still
more
strange
at
his
going
out
than
at
his
coming
in
oh
that
would
be
to
live
like
a
happy
woman
do
you
happen
marquise
said
fouquet
smiling
to
be
speaking
of
my
wife
yes
certainly
of
her
i
spoke
well
you
need
not
envy
her
lot
marquise
of
all
the
women
with
whom
i
have
had
any
relations
madame
fouquet
is
the
one
i
see
the
least
of
and
who
has
the
least
intercourse
with
me
at
least
monsieur
she
is
not
reduced
to
place
as
i
have
done
her
hand
upon
the
ornament
of
a
glass
to
call
you
to
her
at
least
you
do
not
reply
to
her
by
the
mysterious
alarming
sound
of
a
bell
the
spring
of
which
comes
from
i
don
t
know
where
at
least
you
have
not
forbidden
her
to
endeavor
to
discover
the
secret
of
these
communications
under
pain
of
breaking
off
forever
your
connections
with
her
as
you
have
forbidden
all
who
come
here
before
me
and
who
will
come
after
me
dear
marquise
how
unjust
you
are
and
how
little
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
in
thus
exclaiming
against
mystery
it
is
with
mystery
alone
we
can
love
without
trouble
it
is
with
love
without
trouble
alone
that
we
can
be
happy
but
let
us
return
to
ourselves
to
that
devotion
of
which
you
were
speaking
or
rather
let
me
labor
under
a
pleasing
delusion
and
believe
this
devotion
is
love
just
now
repeated
the
marquise
passing
over
her
eyes
a
hand
that
might
have
been
a
model
for
the
graceful
contours
of
antiquity
just
now
i
was
prepared
to
speak
my
ideas
were
clear
and
bold
now
i
am
quite
confused
quite
troubled
i
fear
i
bring
you
bad
news
if
it
is
to
that
bad
news
i
owe
your
presence
marquise
welcome
be
even
that
bad
news
or
rather
marquise
since
you
allow
that
i
am
not
quite
indifferent
to
you
let
me
hear
nothing
of
the
bad
news
but
speak
of
yourself
no
no
on
the
contrary
demand
it
of
me
require
me
to
tell
it
to
you
instantly
and
not
to
allow
myself
to
be
turned
aside
by
any
feeling
whatever
fouquet
my
friend
it
is
of
immense
importance
you
astonish
me
marquise
i
will
even
say
you
almost
frighten
me
you
so
serious
so
collected
you
who
know
the
world
we
live
in
so
well
is
it
then
important
oh
very
important
in
the
first
place
how
did
you
come
here
you
shall
know
that
presently
but
first
to
something
of
more
consequence
speak
marquise
speak
i
implore
you
have
pity
on
my
impatience
do
you
know
that
colbert
is
made
intendant
of
the
finances
bah
colbert
little
colbert
yes
colbert
little
colbert
mazarin
s
factotum
the
same
well
what
do
you
see
so
terrific
in
that
dear
marquise
little
colbert
is
intendant
that
is
astonishing
i
confess
but
is
not
terrible
do
you
think
the
king
has
given
without
pressing
motive
such
a
place
to
one
you
call
a
little
cuistre
in
the
first
place
is
it
positively
true
that
the
king
has
given
it
to
him
it
is
so
said
ay
but
who
says
so
everybody
everybody
that
s
nobody
mention
some
one
likely
to
be
well
informed
who
says
so
madame
vanel
ah
now
you
begin
to
frighten
me
in
earnest
said
fouquet
laughing
if
any
one
is
well
informed
or
ought
to
be
well
informed
it
is
the
person
you
name
do
not
speak
ill
of
poor
marguerite
monsieur
fouquet
for
she
still
loves
you
bah
indeed
that
is
scarcely
credible
i
thought
little
colbert
as
you
said
just
now
had
passed
over
that
love
and
left
the
impression
upon
it
of
a
spot
of
ink
or
a
stain
of
grease
fouquet
fouquet
is
this
the
way
you
always
treat
the
poor
creatures
you
desert
why
you
surely
are
not
going
to
undertake
the
defense
of
madame
vanel
yes
i
will
undertake
it
for
i
repeat
she
loves
you
still
and
the
proof
is
she
saves
you
but
your
interposition
marquise
that
is
very
cunning
on
her
part
no
angel
could
be
more
agreeable
to
me
or
could
lead
me
more
certainly
to
salvation
but
let
me
ask
you
do
you
know
marguerite
she
was
my
convent
friend
and
you
say
that
she
has
informed
you
that
monsieur
colbert
was
named
intendant
yes
she
did
well
enlighten
me
marquise
granted
monsieur
colbert
is
intendant
so
be
it
in
what
can
an
intendant
that
is
to
say
my
subordinate
my
clerk
give
me
umbrage
or
injure
me
even
if
he
is
monsieur
colbert
you
do
not
reflect
monsieur
apparently
replied
the
marquise
upon
what
this
that
monsieur
colbert
hates
you
hates
me
cried
fouquet
good
heavens
marquise
whence
do
you
come
where
can
you
live
hates
me
why
all
the
world
hates
me
he
of
course
as
others
do
he
more
than
others
more
than
others
let
him
he
is
ambitious
who
is
not
marquise
yes
but
with
him
ambition
has
no
bounds
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
since
he
made
it
a
point
to
succeed
me
with
madame
vanel
and
obtained
his
end
look
at
that
do
you
mean
to
say
he
has
the
presumption
to
pass
from
intendant
to
superintendent
have
you
not
yourself
already
had
the
same
fear
oh
oh
said
fouquet
to
succeed
with
madame
vanel
is
one
thing
to
succeed
me
with
the
king
is
another
france
is
not
to
be
purchased
so
easily
as
the
wife
of
a
maitre
des
comptes
eh
monsieur
everything
is
to
be
bought
if
not
by
gold
by
intrigue
nobody
knows
to
the
contrary
better
than
you
madame
you
to
whom
i
have
offered
millions
instead
of
millions
fouquet
you
should
have
offered
me
a
true
only
and
boundless
love
i
might
have
accepted
that
so
you
see
still
everything
is
to
be
bought
if
not
in
one
way
by
another
so
colbert
in
your
opinion
is
in
a
fair
way
of
bargaining
for
my
place
of
superintendent
make
yourself
easy
on
that
head
my
dear
marquise
he
is
not
yet
rich
enough
to
purchase
it
but
if
he
should
rob
you
of
it
ah
that
is
another
thing
unfortunately
before
he
can
reach
me
that
is
to
say
the
body
of
the
place
he
must
destroy
must
make
a
breach
in
the
advanced
works
and
i
am
devilishly
well
fortified
marquise
what
you
call
your
advanced
works
are
your
creatures
are
they
not
your
friends
exactly
so
and
is
d
eymeris
one
of
your
creatures
yes
he
is
is
lyodot
one
of
your
friends
certainly
de
vanin
de
vanin
ah
they
may
do
what
they
like
with
him
but
but
but
they
must
not
touch
the
others
well
if
you
are
anxious
they
should
not
touch
mm
d
eymeris
and
lyodot
it
is
time
to
look
about
you
who
threatens
them
will
you
listen
to
me
now
attentively
marquise
without
interrupting
me
speak
well
this
morning
marguerite
sent
for
me
and
what
did
she
want
with
you
i
dare
not
see
fouquet
myself
said
she
bah
why
should
she
think
i
would
reproach
her
poor
woman
she
vastly
deceives
herself
see
him
yourself
said
she
and
tell
him
to
beware
of
what
she
warned
me
to
beware
of
her
lover
i
have
told
you
she
still
loves
you
go
on
marquise
m
colbert
she
added
came
to
me
two
hours
ago
to
inform
me
he
was
appointed
i
have
already
told
you
marquise
that
colbert
would
only
be
the
more
in
my
power
for
that
yes
but
that
is
not
all
marguerite
is
intimate
as
you
know
with
madame
d
eymeris
and
madame
lyodot
i
know
it
well
colbert
put
many
questions
to
her
relative
to
the
fortunes
of
these
two
gentlemen
and
as
to
the
devotion
they
had
for
you
oh
as
to
those
two
i
can
answer
for
them
they
must
be
killed
before
they
will
cease
to
be
mine
then
as
madame
vanel
was
obliged
to
quit
colbert
for
an
instant
to
receive
a
visitor
and
as
colbert
is
industrious
scarcely
was
the
new
intendant
left
alone
before
he
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
there
was
paper
on
the
table
began
to
make
notes
notes
concerning
d
eymeris
and
lyodot
exactly
i
should
like
to
know
what
those
notes
were
about
and
that
is
just
what
i
have
brought
you
madame
vanel
has
taken
colbert
s
notes
and
sent
them
to
me
no
but
by
a
chance
which
resembles
a
miracle
she
has
a
duplicate
of
those
notes
how
could
she
get
that
listen
i
told
you
that
colbert
found
paper
on
the
table
yes
that
he
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
yes
and
wrote
upon
that
paper
yes
well
this
pencil
was
a
consequently
hard
so
it
marked
in
black
upon
the
first
sheet
and
in
white
upon
the
second
go
on
colbert
when
tearing
off
the
first
sheet
took
no
notice
of
the
second
well
well
on
the
second
was
to
be
read
what
had
been
written
on
the
first
madame
vanel
read
it
and
sent
for
me
yes
yes
then
when
she
was
assured
i
was
your
devoted
friend
she
gave
me
the
paper
and
told
me
the
secret
of
this
house
and
this
paper
said
fouquet
in
some
degree
of
agitation
here
it
is
monsieur
read
it
said
the
marquise
fouquet
read
names
of
the
farmers
of
revenue
to
be
condemned
by
the
chamber
of
justice
d
eymeris
friend
of
lyodot
friend
of
de
vanin
indif
d
eymeris
and
lyodot
cried
fouquet
reading
the
paper
eagerly
again
friends
of
pointed
the
marquise
with
her
finger
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
words
to
be
condemned
by
the
chamber
of
justice
dame
said
the
marquise
that
is
clear
enough
i
think
besides
that
is
not
all
read
on
read
on
and
fouquet
continued
the
two
first
to
death
the
third
to
be
dismissed
with
mm
d
hautemont
and
de
la
vallette
who
will
only
have
their
property
confiscated
great
god
cried
fouquet
to
death
to
death
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
but
even
if
the
chamber
of
justice
should
condemn
them
to
death
the
king
will
never
ratify
their
condemnation
and
they
can
not
be
executed
without
the
king
s
signature
the
king
has
made
colbert
intendant
oh
cried
fouquet
as
if
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
abyss
that
yawned
beneath
his
feet
impossible
impossible
but
who
passed
a
pencil
over
the
marks
made
by
colbert
i
did
i
was
afraid
the
first
would
be
effaced
oh
i
will
know
all
you
will
know
nothing
monsieur
you
despise
your
enemy
too
much
for
that
pardon
me
my
dear
marquise
excuse
me
yes
colbert
is
my
enemy
i
believe
him
to
be
so
yes
colbert
is
a
man
to
be
dreaded
i
admit
but
i
i
have
time
and
as
you
are
here
as
you
have
assured
me
of
your
devotion
as
you
have
allowed
me
to
hope
for
your
love
as
we
are
alone
i
came
here
to
save
you
monsieur
fouquet
and
not
to
ruin
myself
said
the
marquise
rising
therefore
beware
marquise
in
truth
you
terrify
yourself
too
much
at
least
unless
this
terror
is
but
a
pretext
he
is
very
deep
very
deep
this
colbert
beware
fouquet
in
his
turn
drew
himself
up
and
i
asked
he
and
you
you
have
only
a
noble
heart
beware
beware
so
i
have
done
what
was
right
my
friend
at
the
risk
of
my
reputation
adieu
not
adieu
au
revoir
perhaps
said
the
marquise
giving
her
hand
to
fouquet
to
kiss
and
walking
towards
the
door
with
so
firm
a
step
that
he
did
not
dare
to
bar
her
passage
as
to
fouquet
he
retook
with
his
head
hanging
down
and
a
fixed
cloud
on
his
brow
the
path
of
the
subterranean
passage
along
which
ran
the
metal
wires
that
communicated
from
one
house
to
the
other
transmitting
through
two
glasses
the
wishes
and
signals
of
hidden
correspondents
chapter
lv
the
abbe
fouquet
fouquet
hastened
back
to
his
apartment
by
the
subterranean
passage
and
immediately
closed
the
mirror
with
the
spring
he
was
scarcely
in
his
voice
crying
open
the
door
monseigneur
i
entreat
you
open
the
door
fouquet
quickly
restored
a
little
order
to
everything
that
might
have
revealed
either
his
absence
or
his
agitation
he
spread
his
papers
over
the
desk
took
up
a
pen
and
to
gain
time
said
through
the
closed
door
who
is
there
what
monseigneur
do
you
not
know
me
replied
the
voice
yes
yes
said
fouquet
to
himself
yes
my
friend
i
know
you
well
enough
and
then
aloud
is
it
not
gourville
why
yes
monseigneur
fouquet
arose
cast
a
look
at
one
of
his
glasses
went
to
the
door
pushed
back
the
bolt
and
gourville
entered
ah
monseigneur
monseigneur
cried
he
what
cruelty
in
what
i
have
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
imploring
you
to
open
the
door
and
you
would
not
even
answer
me
once
and
for
all
you
know
that
i
will
not
be
disturbed
when
i
am
busy
now
although
i
might
make
you
an
exception
gourville
i
insist
upon
my
orders
being
respected
by
others
monseigneur
at
this
moment
orders
doors
bolts
locks
and
walls
i
could
have
broken
forced
and
overthrown
ah
ah
it
relates
to
some
great
event
then
asked
fouquet
oh
i
assure
you
it
does
monseigneur
replied
gourville
and
what
is
this
event
said
fouquet
a
little
troubled
by
the
evident
agitation
of
his
most
intimate
confidant
there
is
a
secret
chamber
of
justice
instituted
monseigneur
i
know
there
is
but
do
the
members
meet
gourville
they
not
only
meet
but
they
have
passed
a
sentence
monseigneur
a
sentence
said
the
superintendent
with
a
shudder
and
pallor
he
could
not
conceal
a
sentence
and
on
whom
two
of
your
best
friends
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
do
you
mean
but
what
sort
of
a
sentence
sentence
of
death
passed
oh
you
must
be
mistaken
gourville
that
is
impossible
here
is
a
copy
of
the
sentence
which
the
king
is
to
sign
if
he
has
not
already
signed
it
fouquet
seized
the
paper
eagerly
read
it
and
returned
it
to
gourville
the
king
will
never
sign
that
said
he
gourville
shook
his
head
monseigneur
colbert
is
a
bold
councilor
do
not
be
too
confident
monsieur
colbert
again
cried
fouquet
how
is
it
that
that
name
rises
upon
all
occasions
to
torment
my
ears
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
you
make
so
trifling
a
subject
of
too
much
importance
gourville
let
colbert
appear
i
will
face
him
let
him
raise
his
head
i
will
crush
him
but
you
understand
there
must
be
an
outline
upon
which
my
look
may
fall
there
must
be
a
surface
upon
which
my
feet
may
be
placed
patience
monseigneur
for
you
do
not
know
what
colbert
is
study
him
quickly
it
is
with
this
dark
financier
as
it
is
with
meteors
which
the
eye
never
sees
completely
before
their
disastrous
invasion
when
we
feel
them
we
are
dead
oh
gourville
this
is
going
too
far
replied
fouquet
smiling
allow
me
my
friend
not
to
be
so
easily
frightened
colbert
a
meteor
corbleu
we
confront
the
meteor
let
us
see
acts
and
not
words
what
has
he
done
he
has
ordered
two
gibbets
of
the
executioner
of
paris
answered
gourville
fouquet
raised
his
head
and
a
flash
gleamed
from
his
eyes
are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
cried
he
here
is
the
proof
monseigneur
and
gourville
held
out
to
the
superintendent
a
note
communicated
by
a
certain
secretary
of
the
hotel
de
ville
who
was
one
of
fouquet
s
creatures
yes
that
is
true
murmured
the
minister
the
scaffold
may
be
prepared
but
the
king
has
not
signed
gourville
the
king
will
not
sign
i
shall
soon
know
said
gourville
how
if
the
king
has
signed
the
gibbets
will
be
sent
this
evening
to
the
hotel
de
ville
in
order
to
be
got
up
and
ready
by
morning
oh
no
no
cried
the
superintendent
once
again
you
are
all
deceived
and
deceive
me
in
my
turn
lyodot
came
to
see
me
only
the
day
before
yesterday
only
three
days
ago
i
received
a
present
of
some
syracuse
wine
from
poor
d
eymeris
what
does
that
prove
replied
gourville
except
that
the
chamber
of
justice
has
been
secretly
assembled
has
deliberated
in
the
absence
of
the
accused
and
that
the
whole
proceeding
was
complete
when
they
were
arrested
what
are
they
then
arrested
no
doubt
they
are
but
where
when
and
how
have
they
been
arrested
lyodot
yesterday
at
daybreak
d
eymeris
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
evening
as
he
was
returning
from
the
house
of
his
mistress
their
disappearances
had
disturbed
nobody
but
at
length
colbert
all
at
once
raised
the
mask
and
caused
the
affair
to
be
published
it
is
being
cried
by
sound
of
trumpet
at
this
moment
in
paris
and
in
truth
monseigneur
there
is
scarcely
anybody
but
yourself
ignorant
of
the
event
fouquet
began
to
walk
about
in
his
chamber
with
an
uneasiness
that
became
more
and
more
serious
what
do
you
decide
upon
monseigneur
said
gourville
if
it
were
really
as
easy
as
you
say
i
would
go
to
the
king
cried
fouquet
but
as
i
go
to
the
louvre
i
will
pass
by
the
hotel
de
ville
we
shall
see
if
the
sentence
is
signed
incredulity
thou
art
the
pest
of
all
great
minds
said
gourville
shrugging
his
shoulders
gourville
yes
continued
he
and
incredulity
thou
ruinest
as
contagion
destroys
the
most
robust
health
that
is
to
say
in
an
instant
let
us
go
cried
fouquet
desire
the
door
to
be
opened
gourville
be
cautious
said
the
latter
the
abbe
fouquet
is
there
ah
my
brother
replied
fouquet
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
he
is
there
is
he
he
knows
all
the
ill
news
then
and
is
rejoiced
to
bring
it
to
me
as
usual
the
devil
if
my
brother
is
there
my
affairs
are
bad
gourville
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
sooner
i
should
have
been
the
more
readily
convinced
monseigneur
calumniates
him
said
gourville
laughing
if
he
is
come
it
is
not
with
a
bad
intention
what
do
you
excuse
him
cried
fouquet
a
fellow
without
a
heart
without
ideas
a
devourer
of
wealth
he
knows
you
are
rich
and
would
ruin
me
no
but
he
would
have
your
purse
that
is
all
enough
enough
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
per
month
during
two
years
corbleu
it
is
i
that
pay
gourville
and
i
know
my
figures
gourville
laughed
in
a
silent
sly
manner
yes
yes
you
mean
to
say
it
is
the
king
pays
said
the
superintendent
ah
gourville
that
is
a
vile
joke
this
is
not
the
place
monseigneur
do
not
be
angry
well
then
send
away
the
abbe
fouquet
i
have
not
a
sou
gourville
made
a
step
towards
the
door
he
has
been
a
month
without
seeing
me
continued
fouquet
why
could
he
not
be
two
months
because
he
repents
of
living
in
bad
company
said
gourville
and
prefers
you
to
all
his
bandits
thanks
for
the
preference
you
make
a
strange
advocate
gourville
the
advocate
of
the
abbe
fouquet
eh
but
everything
and
every
man
has
a
good
side
their
useful
side
monseigneur
the
bandits
whom
the
abbe
keeps
in
pay
and
drink
have
their
useful
side
have
they
prove
that
if
you
please
let
the
circumstance
arise
monseigneur
and
you
will
be
very
glad
to
have
these
bandits
under
your
hand
you
advise
me
then
to
be
reconciled
to
the
abbe
said
fouquet
ironically
i
advise
you
monseigneur
not
to
quarrel
with
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
twenty
loose
fellows
who
by
putting
their
rapiers
end
to
end
would
form
a
cordon
of
steel
capable
of
surrounding
three
thousand
men
fouquet
darted
a
searching
glance
at
gourville
and
passing
before
him
that
is
all
very
well
let
l
abbe
fouquet
be
introduced
said
he
to
the
footman
you
are
right
gourville
two
minutes
after
the
abbe
fouquet
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
profound
reverence
he
was
a
man
of
from
forty
to
years
of
age
half
churchman
half
soldier
a
spadassin
grafted
upon
an
abbe
upon
seeing
that
he
had
not
a
sword
by
his
side
you
might
be
sure
he
had
pistols
fouquet
saluted
him
more
as
elder
brother
than
as
a
minister
what
can
i
do
to
serve
you
monsieur
l
abbe
said
he
oh
oh
how
coldly
you
speak
to
me
brother
i
speak
like
a
man
who
is
in
a
hurry
monsieur
the
abbe
looked
maliciously
at
gourville
and
anxiously
at
fouquet
and
said
i
have
three
hundred
pistoles
to
pay
to
de
bregi
this
evening
a
play
debt
a
sacred
debt
what
next
said
fouquet
bravely
for
he
comprehended
that
the
abbe
fouquet
would
not
have
disturbed
him
for
such
a
want
a
thousand
to
my
butcher
who
will
supply
no
more
meat
next
twelve
hundred
to
my
tailor
continued
the
abbe
the
fellow
has
made
me
take
back
seven
suits
of
my
people
s
which
compromises
my
liveries
and
my
mistress
talks
of
replacing
me
by
a
farmer
of
the
revenue
which
would
be
a
humiliation
for
the
church
what
else
said
fouquet
you
will
please
to
remark
said
the
abbe
humbly
that
i
have
asked
nothing
for
myself
that
is
delicate
monsieur
replied
fouquet
so
as
you
see
i
wait
and
i
ask
nothing
oh
no
it
is
not
for
want
of
need
though
i
assure
you
the
minister
reflected
for
a
minute
twelve
hundred
pistoles
to
the
tailor
that
seems
a
great
deal
for
clothes
said
he
i
maintain
a
hundred
men
said
the
abbe
proudly
that
is
a
charge
i
believe
why
a
hundred
men
said
fouquet
are
you
a
richelieu
or
a
mazarin
to
require
a
hundred
men
as
a
guard
what
use
do
you
make
of
these
men
speak
and
do
you
ask
me
that
cried
the
abbe
fouquet
ah
how
can
you
put
such
a
question
why
i
maintain
a
hundred
men
ah
why
yes
i
do
put
that
question
to
you
what
have
you
to
do
with
a
hundred
men
answer
ingrate
continued
the
abbe
more
and
more
affected
explain
yourself
why
monsieur
the
superintendent
i
only
want
one
valet
de
chambre
for
my
part
and
even
if
i
were
alone
could
help
myself
very
well
but
you
you
who
have
so
many
enemies
a
hundred
men
are
not
enough
for
me
to
defend
you
with
a
hundred
men
you
ought
to
have
ten
thousand
i
maintain
then
these
men
in
order
that
in
public
places
in
assemblies
no
voice
may
be
raised
against
you
and
without
them
monsieur
you
would
be
loaded
with
imprecations
you
would
be
torn
to
pieces
you
would
not
last
a
week
no
not
a
week
do
you
understand
ah
i
did
not
know
you
were
my
champion
to
such
an
extent
monsieur
le
abbe
you
doubt
it
cried
the
abbe
listen
then
to
what
happened
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
in
the
rue
de
la
hochette
a
man
was
cheapening
a
fowl
well
how
could
that
injure
me
abbe
this
way
the
fowl
was
not
fat
the
purchaser
refused
to
give
eighteen
sous
for
it
saying
that
he
could
not
afford
eighteen
sous
for
the
skin
of
a
fowl
from
which
fouquet
had
sucked
all
the
fat
go
on
the
joke
caused
a
deal
of
laughter
continued
the
abbe
laughter
at
your
expense
death
to
the
devils
and
the
canaille
were
delighted
the
joker
added
give
me
a
fowl
fed
by
colbert
if
you
like
and
i
will
pay
all
you
and
immediately
there
was
a
clapping
of
hands
a
frightful
scandal
you
understand
a
scandal
which
forces
a
brother
to
hide
his
face
fouquet
colored
and
you
veiled
it
said
the
superintendent
no
for
so
it
happened
i
had
one
of
my
men
in
the
crowd
a
new
recruit
from
the
provinces
one
menneville
whom
i
like
very
much
he
made
his
way
through
the
press
saying
to
the
joker
mille
barbes
monsieur
the
false
joker
here
s
a
thrust
for
colbert
and
one
for
fouquet
replied
the
joker
upon
which
they
drew
in
front
of
the
cook
s
shop
with
a
hedge
of
the
curious
round
them
and
five
hundred
as
curious
at
the
windows
well
said
fouquet
well
monsieur
my
menneville
spitted
the
joker
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
spectators
and
said
to
the
cook
take
this
goose
my
friend
for
it
is
fatter
than
your
that
is
the
way
monsieur
ended
the
abbe
triumphantly
in
which
i
spend
my
revenues
i
maintain
the
honor
of
the
family
monsieur
fouquet
hung
his
head
and
i
have
a
hundred
as
good
as
he
continued
the
abbe
very
well
said
fouquet
give
the
account
to
gourville
and
remain
here
this
evening
shall
we
have
supper
yes
there
will
be
supper
but
the
chest
is
closed
gourville
will
open
it
for
you
leave
us
monsieur
l
abbe
leave
us
then
we
are
friends
said
the
abbe
with
a
bow
oh
yes
friends
come
gourville
are
you
going
out
you
will
not
stay
to
supper
then
i
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
rest
easy
abbe
then
aside
to
gourville
let
them
put
to
my
english
horses
said
he
and
direct
the
coachman
to
stop
at
the
hotel
de
ville
de
paris
chapter
lvi
de
la
fontaine
s
wine
carriages
were
already
bringing
the
guests
of
fouquet
to
already
the
whole
house
was
getting
warm
with
the
preparations
for
supper
when
the
superintendent
launched
his
fleet
horses
upon
the
roads
to
paris
and
going
by
the
quays
in
order
to
meet
fewer
people
on
the
way
soon
reached
the
hotel
de
ville
it
wanted
a
quarter
to
eight
fouquet
alighted
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
and
on
foot
directed
his
course
towards
the
place
de
greve
accompanied
by
gourville
at
the
turning
of
the
place
they
saw
a
man
dressed
in
black
and
violet
of
dignified
mien
who
was
preparing
to
stop
at
vincennes
he
had
before
him
a
large
hamper
filled
with
bottles
which
he
had
just
purchased
at
the
cabaret
with
the
sign
of
l
eh
but
that
is
vatel
my
maitre
d
hotel
said
fouquet
to
gourville
yes
monseigneur
replied
the
latter
what
can
he
have
been
doing
at
the
sign
of
l
buying
wine
no
doubt
what
buy
wine
for
me
at
a
cabaret
said
fouquet
my
cellar
then
must
be
in
a
miserable
condition
and
he
advanced
towards
the
maitre
d
hotel
who
was
arranging
his
bottles
in
the
carriage
with
the
most
minute
care
hola
vatel
said
he
in
the
voice
of
a
master
take
care
monseigneur
said
gourville
you
will
be
recognized
very
well
of
what
consequence
vatel
the
man
dressed
in
black
and
violet
turned
round
he
had
a
good
and
mild
countenance
without
expression
a
mathematician
minus
the
pride
a
certain
fire
sparkled
in
the
eyes
of
this
personage
a
rather
sly
smile
played
round
his
lips
but
the
observer
might
soon
have
remarked
that
this
fire
and
this
smile
applied
to
nothing
enlightened
nothing
vatel
laughed
like
an
absent
man
and
amused
himself
like
a
child
at
the
sound
of
his
master
s
voice
he
turned
round
exclaiming
oh
monseigneur
yes
it
is
i
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
vatel
wine
you
are
buying
wine
at
a
cabaret
in
the
place
de
greve
but
monseigneur
said
vatel
quietly
after
having
darted
a
hostile
glance
at
gourville
why
am
i
interfered
with
here
is
my
cellar
kept
in
bad
order
no
certes
vatel
no
but
but
what
replied
vatel
gourville
touched
fouquet
s
elbow
don
t
be
angry
vatel
i
thought
my
cellar
your
cellar
sufficiently
well
stocked
for
us
to
be
able
to
dispense
with
recourse
to
the
cellar
of
l
eh
monsieur
said
vatel
shrinking
from
monseigneur
to
monsieur
with
a
degree
of
disdain
your
cellar
is
so
well
stocked
that
when
certain
of
your
guests
dine
with
you
they
have
nothing
to
drink
fouquet
in
great
surprise
looked
at
gourville
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
your
butler
had
not
wine
for
all
tastes
monsieur
and
that
de
la
fontaine
pelisson
and
conrart
do
not
drink
when
they
come
to
the
house
these
gentlemen
do
not
like
strong
wine
what
is
to
be
done
then
well
and
therefore
well
then
i
have
found
here
a
vin
de
joigny
which
they
like
i
know
they
come
here
once
a
week
to
drink
at
the
that
is
the
reason
i
am
making
this
provision
fouquet
had
no
more
to
say
he
was
convinced
vatel
on
his
part
had
much
more
to
say
without
doubt
and
it
was
plain
he
was
getting
warm
it
is
just
as
if
you
would
reproach
me
monseigneur
for
going
to
the
rue
planche
milbray
to
fetch
myself
the
cider
loret
drinks
when
he
comes
to
dine
at
your
house
loret
drinks
cider
at
my
house
cried
fouquet
laughing
certainly
he
does
monsieur
and
that
is
the
reason
why
he
dines
there
with
pleasure
vatel
cried
fouquet
pressing
the
hand
of
his
maitre
d
hotel
you
are
a
man
i
thank
you
vatel
for
having
understood
that
at
my
house
de
la
fontaine
conrart
and
loret
are
as
great
as
dukes
and
peers
as
great
as
princes
greater
than
myself
vatel
you
are
a
good
servant
and
i
double
your
salary
vatel
did
not
even
thank
his
master
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
little
murmuring
this
superb
sentiment
to
be
thanked
for
having
done
one
s
duty
is
humiliating
he
is
right
said
gourville
as
he
drew
fouquet
s
attention
by
a
gesture
to
another
point
he
showed
him
a
tumbrel
drawn
by
two
horses
upon
which
rocked
two
strong
gibbets
bound
together
back
to
back
by
chains
whilst
an
archer
seated
upon
the
suffered
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
head
cast
down
the
comments
of
a
hundred
vagabonds
who
guessed
the
destination
of
the
gibbets
and
were
escorting
them
to
the
hotel
de
ville
fouquet
started
it
is
decided
you
see
said
gourville
but
it
is
not
done
replied
fouquet
oh
do
not
flatter
yourself
monseigneur
if
they
have
thus
lulled
your
friendship
and
suspicions
if
things
have
gone
so
far
you
will
be
able
to
undo
nothing
but
i
have
not
given
my
sanction
de
lyonne
has
ratified
for
you
i
will
go
to
the
louvre
oh
no
you
will
not
would
you
advise
such
baseness
cried
fouquet
would
you
advise
me
to
abandon
my
friends
would
you
advise
me
whilst
able
to
fight
to
throw
the
arms
i
hold
in
my
hand
to
the
ground
i
do
not
advise
you
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
monseigneur
are
you
in
a
position
to
quit
the
post
of
superintendent
at
this
moment
no
well
if
the
king
wishes
to
displace
you
he
will
displace
me
absent
as
well
as
present
yes
but
you
will
not
have
insulted
him
yes
but
i
shall
have
been
base
now
i
am
not
willing
that
my
friends
should
die
and
they
shall
not
die
for
that
it
is
necessary
you
should
go
to
the
louvre
is
it
not
gourville
beware
once
at
the
louvre
you
will
be
forced
to
defend
your
friends
openly
that
is
to
say
to
make
a
profession
of
faith
or
you
will
be
forced
to
abandon
them
irrevocably
never
pardon
me
the
king
will
propose
the
alternative
to
you
rigorously
or
else
you
will
propose
it
to
him
yourself
that
is
true
that
is
the
reason
why
conflict
must
be
avoided
let
us
return
to
monseigneur
gourville
i
will
not
stir
from
this
place
where
the
crime
is
to
be
carried
out
where
my
disgrace
is
to
be
accomplished
i
will
not
stir
i
say
till
i
have
found
some
means
of
combating
my
enemies
monseigneur
replied
gourville
you
would
excite
my
pity
if
i
did
not
know
you
for
one
of
the
great
spirits
of
this
world
you
possess
a
hundred
and
fifty
millions
you
are
equal
to
the
king
in
position
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
millions
his
superior
in
money
colbert
has
not
even
had
the
wit
to
have
the
will
of
mazarin
accepted
now
when
a
man
is
the
richest
person
in
a
kingdom
and
will
take
the
trouble
to
spend
the
money
if
things
are
done
he
does
not
like
it
is
because
he
is
a
poor
man
let
us
return
to
i
say
to
consult
with
pelisson
we
will
no
monseigneur
to
count
your
money
so
be
it
said
fouquet
with
angry
eyes
yes
yes
to
he
got
into
his
carriage
again
and
gourville
with
him
upon
their
road
at
the
end
of
the
faubourg
they
overtook
the
humble
equipage
of
vatel
who
was
quietly
conveying
home
his
vin
de
joigny
the
black
horses
going
at
a
swift
pace
alarmed
as
they
passed
the
timid
hack
of
the
maitre
d
hotel
who
putting
his
head
out
at
the
window
cried
in
a
fright
take
care
of
my
bottles
in
the
edition
volume
ends
chapter
lvii
the
gallery
of
fifty
persons
were
waiting
for
the
superintendent
he
did
not
even
take
the
time
to
place
himself
in
the
hands
of
his
valet
de
chambre
for
a
minute
but
from
the
perron
went
straight
into
the
premier
salon
there
his
friends
were
assembled
in
full
chat
the
intendant
was
about
to
order
supper
to
be
served
but
above
all
the
abbe
fouquet
watched
for
the
return
of
his
brother
and
was
endeavoring
to
do
the
honors
of
the
house
in
his
absence
upon
the
arrival
of
the
superintendent
a
murmur
of
joy
and
affection
was
heard
fouquet
full
of
affability
good
humor
and
munificence
was
beloved
by
his
poets
his
artists
and
his
men
of
business
his
brow
upon
which
his
little
court
read
as
upon
that
of
a
god
all
the
movements
of
his
soul
and
thence
drew
rules
of
conduct
his
brow
upon
which
affairs
of
state
never
impressed
a
wrinkle
was
this
evening
paler
than
usual
and
more
than
one
friendly
eye
remarked
that
pallor
fouquet
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
presided
gayly
during
supper
he
recounted
vatel
s
expedition
to
la
fontaine
he
related
the
history
of
menneville
and
the
skinny
fowl
to
pelisson
in
such
a
manner
that
all
the
table
heard
it
a
tempest
of
laughter
and
jokes
ensued
which
was
only
checked
by
a
serious
and
even
sad
gesture
from
pelisson
the
abbe
fouquet
not
being
able
to
comprehend
why
his
brother
should
have
led
the
conversation
in
that
direction
listened
with
all
his
ears
and
sought
in
the
countenance
of
gourville
or
in
that
of
his
brother
an
explanation
which
nothing
afforded
him
pelisson
took
up
the
matter
did
they
mention
colbert
then
said
he
why
not
replied
fouquet
if
true
as
it
is
said
to
be
that
the
king
has
made
him
his
intendant
scarcely
had
fouquet
uttered
these
words
with
a
marked
intention
than
an
explosion
broke
forth
among
the
guests
the
miser
said
one
the
mean
pitiful
fellow
said
another
the
hypocrite
said
a
third
pelisson
exchanged
a
meaning
look
with
fouquet
messieurs
said
he
in
truth
we
are
abusing
a
man
whom
no
one
knows
it
is
neither
charitable
nor
reasonable
and
here
is
monsieur
le
surintendant
who
i
am
sure
agrees
with
me
entirely
replied
fouquet
let
the
fat
fowls
of
colbert
alone
our
business
is
with
the
faisans
truffes
of
m
vatel
this
speech
stopped
the
dark
cloud
which
was
beginning
to
throw
its
shade
over
the
guests
gourville
succeeded
so
well
in
animating
the
poets
with
the
vin
de
joigny
the
abbe
intelligent
as
a
man
who
stands
in
need
of
his
host
s
money
so
enlivened
the
financiers
and
the
men
of
the
sword
that
amidst
the
vapors
of
this
joy
and
the
noise
of
conversation
inquietudes
disappeared
completely
the
will
of
cardinal
mazarin
was
the
text
of
the
conversation
at
the
second
course
and
dessert
then
fouquet
ordered
bowls
of
sweetmeats
and
fountains
of
liquor
to
be
carried
into
the
salon
adjoining
the
gallery
he
led
the
way
thither
conducting
by
the
hand
a
lady
the
queen
by
his
preference
of
the
evening
the
musicians
then
supped
and
the
promenades
in
the
gallery
and
the
gardens
commenced
beneath
a
spring
sky
mild
and
pelisson
then
approached
the
superintendent
and
said
something
troubles
monseigneur
greatly
replied
the
minister
ask
gourville
to
tell
you
what
it
is
pelisson
on
turning
round
found
la
fontaine
treading
upon
his
heels
he
was
obliged
to
listen
to
a
latin
verse
which
the
poet
had
composed
upon
vatel
la
fontaine
had
for
an
hour
been
scanning
this
verse
in
all
corners
seeking
some
one
to
pour
it
out
upon
advantageously
he
thought
he
had
caught
pelisson
but
the
latter
escaped
him
he
turned
towards
sorel
who
had
himself
just
composed
a
quatrain
in
honor
of
the
supper
and
the
amphytrion
la
fontaine
in
vain
endeavored
to
gain
attention
to
his
verses
sorel
wanted
to
obtain
a
hearing
for
his
quatrain
he
was
obliged
to
retreat
before
le
comte
de
charost
whose
arm
fouquet
had
just
taken
l
abbe
fouquet
perceived
that
the
poet
as
usual
was
about
to
follow
the
two
talkers
and
he
interposed
la
fontaine
seized
upon
him
and
recited
his
verses
the
abbe
who
was
quite
innocent
of
latin
nodded
his
head
in
cadence
at
every
roll
which
la
fontaine
impressed
upon
his
body
according
to
the
undulations
of
the
dactyls
and
spondees
while
this
was
going
on
behind
the
fouquet
related
the
event
of
the
day
to
his
de
charost
we
will
send
the
idle
and
useless
to
look
at
the
fireworks
said
pelisson
to
gourville
whilst
we
converse
here
so
be
it
said
gourville
addressing
four
words
to
vatel
the
latter
then
led
towards
the
gardens
the
major
part
of
the
beaux
the
ladies
and
the
chatterers
whilst
the
men
walked
in
the
gallery
lighted
by
three
hundred
in
the
sight
of
all
the
admirers
of
fireworks
all
ran
away
towards
the
garden
gourville
approached
fouquet
and
said
monsieur
we
are
here
all
said
fouquet
yes
count
the
superintendent
counted
there
were
eight
persons
pelisson
and
gourville
walked
arm
in
arm
as
if
conversing
upon
vague
and
frivolous
subjects
sorel
and
two
officers
imitated
them
and
in
an
opposite
direction
the
abbe
fouquet
walked
alone
fouquet
with
de
charost
walked
as
if
entirely
absorbed
in
the
conversation
of
his
messieurs
said
he
let
no
one
of
you
raise
his
head
as
he
walks
or
appear
to
pay
attention
to
me
continue
walking
we
are
alone
listen
to
me
a
perfect
silence
ensued
disturbed
only
by
the
distant
cries
of
the
joyous
guests
from
the
groves
whence
they
beheld
the
fireworks
it
was
a
whimsical
spectacle
this
of
these
men
walking
in
groups
as
if
each
one
was
occupied
about
something
whilst
lending
attention
really
only
to
one
amongst
them
who
himself
seemed
to
be
speaking
only
to
his
companion
messieurs
said
fouquet
you
have
without
doubt
remarked
the
absence
of
two
of
my
friends
this
evening
who
were
with
us
on
wednesday
for
god
s
sake
abbe
do
not
stop
it
is
not
necessary
to
enable
you
to
listen
walk
on
carrying
your
head
in
a
natural
way
and
as
you
have
excellent
sight
place
yourself
at
the
window
and
if
any
one
returns
towards
the
gallery
give
us
notice
by
coughing
the
abbe
obeyed
i
have
not
observed
their
absence
said
pelisson
who
at
this
moment
was
turning
his
back
to
fouquet
and
walking
the
other
way
i
do
not
see
lyodot
said
sorel
who
pays
me
my
pension
and
i
said
the
abbe
at
the
window
do
not
see
d
eymeris
who
owes
me
eleven
hundred
livres
from
our
last
game
of
brelan
sorel
continued
fouquet
walking
bent
and
gloomily
you
will
never
receive
your
pension
any
more
from
lyodot
and
you
abbe
will
never
be
paid
you
eleven
hundred
livres
by
d
eymeris
for
both
are
doomed
to
die
to
die
exclaimed
the
whole
assembly
arrested
in
spite
of
themselves
in
the
comedy
they
were
playing
by
that
terrible
word
recover
yourselves
messieurs
said
fouquet
for
perhaps
we
are
watched
i
said
to
die
to
die
repeated
pelisson
what
the
men
i
saw
six
days
ago
full
of
health
gayety
and
the
spirit
of
the
future
what
then
is
man
good
god
that
disease
should
thus
bring
him
down
all
at
once
it
is
not
a
disease
said
fouquet
then
there
is
a
remedy
said
sorel
no
remedy
messieurs
de
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
are
on
the
eve
of
their
last
day
of
what
are
these
gentlemen
dying
then
asked
an
officer
ask
of
him
who
kills
them
replied
fouquet
who
kills
them
are
they
being
killed
then
cried
the
terrified
chorus
they
do
better
still
they
are
hanging
them
murmured
fouquet
in
a
sinister
voice
which
sounded
like
a
funeral
knell
in
that
rich
gallery
splendid
with
pictures
flowers
velvet
and
gold
involuntarily
every
one
stopped
the
abbe
quitted
his
window
the
first
fuses
of
the
fireworks
began
to
mount
above
the
trees
a
prolonged
cry
from
the
gardens
attracted
the
superintendent
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
he
drew
near
to
a
window
and
his
friends
placed
themselves
behind
him
attentive
to
his
least
wish
messieurs
said
he
colbert
has
caused
to
be
arrested
tried
and
will
execute
my
two
friends
what
does
it
become
me
to
do
mordieu
exclaimed
the
abbe
the
first
one
to
speak
run
colbert
through
the
body
monseigneur
said
pelisson
you
must
speak
to
his
majesty
the
king
my
dear
pelisson
himself
signed
the
order
for
the
execution
well
said
the
comte
de
charost
the
execution
must
not
take
place
then
that
is
all
impossible
said
gourville
unless
we
could
corrupt
the
jailers
or
the
governor
said
fouquet
this
night
the
prisoners
might
be
allowed
to
escape
which
of
you
will
take
charge
of
the
transaction
i
said
the
abbe
will
carry
the
money
and
i
said
pelisson
will
be
the
bearer
of
the
words
words
and
money
said
fouquet
five
hundred
thousand
livres
to
the
governor
of
the
conciergerie
that
is
sufficient
nevertheless
it
shall
be
a
million
if
necessary
a
million
cried
the
abbe
why
for
less
than
half
i
would
have
half
paris
sacked
there
must
be
no
disorder
said
pelisson
the
governor
being
gained
the
two
prisoners
escape
once
clear
of
the
fangs
of
the
law
they
will
call
together
the
enemies
of
colbert
and
prove
to
the
king
that
his
young
justice
like
all
other
monstrosities
is
not
infallible
go
to
paris
then
pelisson
said
fouquet
and
bring
hither
the
two
victims
we
shall
see
gourville
gave
pelisson
the
five
hundred
thousand
livres
take
care
the
wind
does
not
carry
you
away
said
the
abbe
what
a
responsibility
peste
let
me
help
you
a
little
silence
said
fouquet
somebody
is
coming
ah
the
fireworks
are
producing
a
magical
effect
at
this
moment
a
shower
of
sparks
fell
rustling
among
the
branches
of
the
neighboring
trees
pelisson
and
gourville
went
out
together
by
the
door
of
the
gallery
fouquet
descended
to
the
garden
with
the
five
last
plotters
chapter
lviii
epicureans
as
fouquet
was
giving
or
appearing
to
give
all
his
attention
to
the
brilliant
illuminations
the
languishing
music
of
the
violins
and
hautboys
the
sparkling
sheaves
of
the
artificial
fires
which
inflaming
the
heavens
with
glowing
reflections
marked
behind
the
trees
the
dark
profile
of
the
donjon
of
vincennes
as
we
say
the
superintendent
was
smiling
on
the
ladies
and
the
poets
the
fete
was
every
whit
as
gay
as
usual
and
vatel
whose
restless
even
jealous
look
earnestly
consulted
the
aspect
of
fouquet
did
not
appear
dissatisfied
with
the
welcome
given
to
the
ordering
of
the
evening
s
entertainment
the
fireworks
over
the
company
dispersed
about
the
gardens
and
beneath
the
marble
porticoes
with
the
delightful
liberty
which
reveals
in
the
master
of
the
house
so
much
forgetfulness
of
greatness
so
much
courteous
hospitality
so
much
magnificent
carelessness
the
poets
wandered
about
arm
in
arm
through
the
groves
some
reclined
upon
beds
of
moss
to
the
great
damage
of
velvet
clothes
and
curled
heads
into
which
little
dried
leaves
and
blades
of
grass
insinuated
themselves
the
ladies
in
small
numbers
listened
to
the
songs
of
the
singers
and
the
verses
of
the
poets
others
listened
to
the
prose
spoken
with
much
art
by
men
who
were
neither
actors
nor
poets
but
to
whom
youth
and
solitude
gave
an
unaccustomed
eloquence
which
appeared
to
them
better
than
everything
else
in
the
world
why
said
la
fontaine
does
not
our
master
epicurus
descend
into
the
garden
epicurus
never
abandoned
his
pupils
the
master
is
wrong
monsieur
said
conrart
you
yourself
are
in
the
wrong
persisting
in
decorating
yourself
with
the
name
of
an
epicurean
indeed
nothing
here
reminds
me
of
the
doctrine
of
the
philosopher
of
gargetta
bah
said
la
fontaine
is
it
not
written
that
epicurus
purchased
a
large
garden
and
lived
in
it
tranquilly
with
his
friends
that
is
true
well
has
not
fouquet
purchased
a
large
garden
at
and
do
we
not
live
here
very
tranquilly
with
him
and
his
friends
yes
without
doubt
unfortunately
it
is
neither
the
garden
nor
the
friends
which
constitute
the
resemblance
now
what
likeness
is
there
between
the
doctrine
of
epicurus
and
that
of
m
fouquet
this
pleasure
gives
happiness
next
well
i
do
not
think
we
ought
to
consider
ourselves
unfortunate
for
my
part
at
least
a
good
repast
vin
de
joigny
which
they
have
the
delicacy
to
go
and
fetch
for
me
from
my
favorite
cabaret
not
one
impertinence
heard
during
a
supper
an
hour
long
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
ten
millionaires
and
twenty
poets
i
stop
you
there
you
mentioned
vin
de
joigny
and
a
good
repast
do
you
persist
in
that
i
persist
anteco
as
they
say
at
port
royal
then
please
to
recollect
that
the
great
epicurus
lived
and
made
his
pupils
live
upon
bread
vegetables
and
water
that
is
not
certain
said
la
fontaine
and
you
appear
to
me
to
be
confounding
epicurus
with
pythagoras
my
dear
conrart
remember
likewise
that
the
ancient
philosopher
was
rather
a
bad
friend
of
the
gods
and
the
magistrates
oh
that
is
what
i
will
not
admit
replied
la
fontaine
epicurus
was
like
m
fouquet
do
not
compare
him
to
monsieur
le
surintendant
said
conrart
in
an
agitated
voice
or
you
would
accredit
the
reports
which
are
circulating
concerning
him
and
us
what
reports
that
we
are
bad
frenchmen
lukewarm
with
regard
to
the
king
deaf
to
the
law
i
return
then
to
my
text
said
la
fontaine
listen
conrart
this
is
the
morality
of
epicurus
whom
besides
i
consider
if
i
must
tell
you
so
as
a
myth
antiquity
is
mostly
mythical
jupiter
if
we
give
a
little
attention
to
it
is
life
alcides
is
strength
the
words
are
there
to
bear
me
out
zeus
that
is
zen
to
live
alcides
that
is
alce
vigor
well
epicurus
that
is
mild
watchfulness
that
is
protection
now
who
watches
better
over
the
state
or
who
protects
individuals
better
than
fouquet
does
you
talk
etymology
and
not
morality
i
say
that
we
modern
epicureans
are
indifferent
citizens
oh
cried
la
fontaine
if
we
become
bad
citizens
it
is
not
through
following
the
maxims
of
our
master
listen
to
one
of
his
principal
aphorisms
i
will
pray
for
good
leaders
well
well
what
does
fouquet
say
to
us
every
day
when
shall
we
be
governed
does
he
say
so
come
conrart
be
frank
he
says
so
that
is
true
well
that
is
a
doctrine
of
epicurus
yes
but
that
is
a
little
seditious
observe
what
seditious
to
wish
to
be
governed
by
good
heads
or
leaders
certainly
when
those
who
govern
are
bad
patience
i
have
a
reply
for
all
even
for
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
listen
would
you
submit
to
those
who
govern
ill
oh
it
is
written
cacos
politeuousi
you
grant
me
the
text
pardieu
i
think
so
do
you
know
you
speak
greek
as
well
as
aesop
did
my
dear
la
fontaine
is
there
any
wickedness
in
that
my
dear
conrart
god
forbid
i
should
say
so
then
let
us
return
to
fouquet
what
did
he
repeat
to
us
all
the
day
was
it
not
this
what
a
cuistre
is
that
mazarin
what
an
ass
what
a
leech
we
must
however
submit
to
that
now
conrart
did
he
say
so
or
did
he
not
i
confess
that
he
said
it
and
even
perhaps
too
often
like
epicurus
my
friend
still
like
epicurus
i
repeat
we
are
epicureans
and
that
is
very
amusing
yes
but
i
am
afraid
there
will
rise
up
by
the
side
of
us
a
sect
like
that
of
epictetus
you
know
him
well
the
philosopher
of
hierapolis
he
who
called
bread
luxury
vegetables
prodigality
and
clear
water
drunkenness
he
who
being
beaten
by
his
master
said
to
him
grumbling
a
little
it
is
true
but
without
being
angry
i
will
lay
a
wager
you
have
broken
my
leg
and
who
won
his
wager
he
was
a
goose
that
fellow
epictetus
granted
but
he
might
easily
become
the
fashion
by
only
changing
his
name
into
that
of
colbert
bah
replied
la
fontaine
that
is
impossible
never
will
you
find
colbert
in
epictetus
you
are
right
i
shall
find
coluber
there
at
the
most
ah
you
are
beaten
conrart
you
are
reduced
to
a
play
upon
words
arnaud
pretends
that
i
have
no
logic
i
have
more
than
m
nicole
yes
replied
conrart
you
have
logic
but
you
are
a
jansenist
this
peroration
was
hailed
with
a
boisterous
shout
of
laughter
by
degrees
the
promenaders
had
been
attracted
by
the
exclamations
of
the
two
disputants
around
the
arbor
under
which
they
were
arguing
the
discussion
had
been
religiously
listened
to
and
fouquet
himself
scarcely
able
to
suppress
his
laughter
had
given
an
example
of
moderation
but
with
the
denouement
of
the
scene
he
threw
off
all
restraint
and
laughed
aloud
everybody
laughed
as
he
did
and
the
two
philosophers
were
saluted
with
unanimous
felicitations
la
fontaine
however
was
declared
conqueror
on
account
of
his
profound
erudition
and
his
irrefragable
logic
conrart
obtained
the
compensation
due
to
an
unsuccessful
combatant
he
was
praised
for
the
loyalty
of
his
intentions
and
the
purity
of
his
conscience
at
the
moment
when
this
jollity
was
manifesting
itself
by
the
most
lively
demonstrations
when
the
ladies
were
reproaching
the
two
adversaries
with
not
having
admitted
women
into
the
system
of
epicurean
happiness
gourville
was
seen
hastening
from
the
other
end
of
the
garden
approaching
fouquet
and
detaching
him
by
his
presence
alone
from
the
group
the
superintendent
preserved
on
his
face
the
smile
and
character
of
carelessness
but
scarcely
was
he
out
of
sight
than
he
threw
off
the
mask
well
said
he
eagerly
where
is
pelisson
what
is
he
doing
pelisson
has
returned
from
paris
has
he
brought
back
the
prisoners
he
has
not
even
seen
the
concierge
of
the
prison
what
did
he
not
tell
him
he
came
from
me
he
told
him
so
but
the
concierge
sent
him
this
reply
if
any
one
came
to
me
from
fouquet
he
would
have
a
letter
from
oh
cried
the
latter
if
a
letter
is
all
he
wants
it
is
useless
monsieur
said
pelisson
showing
himself
at
the
corner
of
the
little
wood
useless
go
yourself
and
speak
in
your
own
name
you
are
right
i
will
go
in
as
if
to
work
let
the
horses
remain
harnessed
pelisson
entertain
my
friends
gourville
one
last
word
of
advice
monseigneur
replied
the
latter
speak
gourville
do
not
go
to
the
concierge
save
at
the
last
minute
it
is
brave
but
it
is
not
wise
excuse
me
monsieur
pelisson
if
i
am
not
of
the
same
opinion
as
you
but
take
my
advice
monseigneur
send
again
a
message
to
this
concierge
he
is
a
worthy
man
but
do
not
carry
it
yourself
i
will
think
of
it
said
fouquet
besides
we
have
all
the
night
before
us
do
not
reckon
too
much
on
time
were
the
hours
we
have
twice
as
many
as
they
are
they
would
not
be
too
much
replied
pelisson
it
is
never
a
fault
to
arrive
too
soon
adieu
said
the
superintendent
come
with
me
pelisson
gourville
i
commend
my
guests
to
your
care
and
he
set
off
the
epicureans
did
not
perceive
that
the
head
of
the
school
had
left
them
the
violins
continued
playing
all
night
long
chapter
lix
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
delay
fouquet
on
leaving
his
house
for
the
second
time
that
day
felt
himself
less
heavy
and
less
disturbed
than
might
have
been
expected
he
turned
towards
pelisson
who
was
meditating
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
some
good
arguments
against
the
violent
proceedings
of
colbert
my
dear
pelisson
said
fouquet
it
is
a
great
pity
you
are
not
a
woman
i
think
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
fortunate
replied
pelisson
for
monseigneur
i
am
excessively
ugly
pelisson
pelisson
said
the
superintendent
laughing
you
repeat
too
often
you
are
ugly
not
to
leave
people
to
believe
that
it
gives
you
much
pain
in
fact
it
does
monseigneur
much
pain
there
is
no
man
more
unfortunate
than
i
i
was
handsome
the
rendered
me
hideous
i
am
deprived
of
a
great
means
of
attraction
now
i
am
your
principal
clerk
or
something
of
that
sort
i
take
great
interest
in
your
affairs
and
if
at
this
moment
i
were
a
pretty
woman
i
could
render
you
an
important
service
what
i
would
go
and
find
the
concierge
of
the
palais
i
would
seduce
him
for
he
is
a
gallant
man
extravagantly
partial
to
women
then
i
would
get
away
our
two
prisoners
i
hope
to
be
able
to
do
so
myself
although
i
am
not
a
pretty
woman
replied
fouquet
granted
monseigneur
but
you
are
compromising
yourself
very
much
oh
cried
fouquet
suddenly
with
one
of
those
secret
transports
which
the
generous
blood
of
youth
or
the
remembrance
of
some
sweet
emotion
infuses
into
the
heart
oh
i
know
a
woman
who
will
enact
the
personage
we
stand
in
need
of
with
the
of
the
concierge
and
on
my
part
i
know
fifty
monseigneur
fifty
trumpets
which
will
inform
the
universe
of
your
generosity
of
your
devotion
to
your
friends
and
consequently
will
ruin
you
sooner
or
later
in
ruining
themselves
i
do
not
speak
of
such
women
pelisson
i
speak
of
a
noble
and
beautiful
creature
who
joins
to
the
intelligence
and
wit
of
her
sex
the
valor
and
coolness
of
ours
i
speak
of
a
woman
handsome
enough
to
make
the
walls
of
a
prison
bow
down
to
salute
her
discreet
enough
to
let
no
one
suspect
by
whom
she
has
been
sent
a
treasure
said
pelisson
you
would
make
a
famous
present
to
monsieur
the
governor
of
the
concierge
peste
monseigneur
he
might
have
his
head
cut
off
but
he
would
before
dying
have
had
such
happiness
as
no
man
had
enjoyed
before
him
and
i
add
said
fouquet
that
the
concierge
of
the
palais
would
not
have
his
head
cut
off
for
he
would
receive
of
me
my
horses
to
effect
his
escape
and
five
hundred
thousand
livres
wherewith
to
live
comfortably
in
england
i
add
that
this
lady
my
friend
would
give
him
nothing
but
the
horses
and
the
money
let
us
go
and
seek
her
pelisson
the
superintendent
reached
forth
his
hand
towards
the
golden
and
silken
cord
placed
in
the
interior
of
his
carriage
but
pelisson
stopped
him
monseigneur
said
he
you
are
going
to
lose
as
much
time
in
seeking
this
lady
as
columbus
took
to
discover
the
new
world
now
we
have
but
two
hours
in
which
we
can
possibly
succeed
the
concierge
once
gone
to
bed
how
shall
we
get
at
him
without
making
a
disturbance
when
daylight
dawns
how
can
we
conceal
our
proceedings
go
go
yourself
monseigneur
and
do
not
seek
either
woman
or
angel
but
my
dear
pelisson
here
we
are
before
her
door
what
before
the
angel
s
door
why
yes
this
is
the
hotel
of
madame
de
belliere
hush
ah
good
lord
exclaimed
pelisson
what
have
you
to
say
against
her
nothing
alas
and
it
is
that
which
causes
my
despair
nothing
absolutely
nothing
why
can
i
not
on
the
contrary
say
ill
enough
of
her
to
prevent
your
going
to
her
but
fouquet
had
already
given
orders
to
stop
and
the
carriage
was
motionless
prevent
me
cried
fouquet
why
no
power
on
earth
should
prevent
my
going
to
pay
my
compliments
to
madame
de
besides
who
knows
that
we
shall
not
stand
in
need
of
her
no
monseigneur
no
but
i
do
not
wish
you
to
wait
for
me
pelisson
replied
fouquet
sincerely
courteous
the
more
reason
i
should
monseigneur
knowing
that
you
are
keeping
me
waiting
you
will
perhaps
stay
a
shorter
time
take
care
you
see
there
is
a
carriage
in
the
courtyard
she
has
some
one
with
her
fouquet
leaned
towards
the
steps
of
the
carriage
one
word
more
cried
pelisson
do
not
go
to
this
lady
till
you
have
been
to
the
concierge
for
heaven
s
sake
eh
five
minutes
pelisson
replied
fouquet
alighting
at
the
steps
of
the
hotel
leaving
pelisson
in
the
carriage
in
a
very
fouquet
ran
upstairs
told
his
name
to
the
footman
which
excited
an
eagerness
and
a
respect
that
showed
the
habit
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
of
honoring
that
name
in
her
family
monsieur
le
surintendant
cried
the
marquise
advancing
very
pale
to
meet
him
what
an
honor
what
an
unexpected
pleasure
said
she
then
in
a
low
voice
take
care
added
the
marquise
marguerite
vanel
is
here
madame
replied
fouquet
rather
agitated
i
came
on
business
one
single
word
and
quickly
if
you
please
and
he
entered
the
salon
madame
vanel
had
risen
paler
more
livid
than
envy
herself
fouquet
in
vain
addressed
her
with
the
most
agreeable
most
pacific
salutation
she
only
replied
by
a
terrible
glance
darted
at
the
marquise
and
fouquet
this
keen
glance
of
a
jealous
woman
is
a
stiletto
which
pierces
every
cuirass
marguerite
vanel
plunged
it
straight
into
the
hearts
of
the
two
confidants
she
made
a
courtesy
to
her
friend
a
more
profound
one
to
fouquet
and
took
leave
under
pretense
of
having
a
number
of
visits
to
make
without
the
marquise
trying
to
prevent
her
or
fouquet
a
prey
to
anxiety
thinking
further
about
her
she
was
scarcely
out
of
the
room
and
fouquet
left
alone
with
the
marquise
before
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
without
saying
a
word
i
expected
you
said
the
marquise
with
a
tender
sigh
oh
no
cried
he
or
you
would
have
sent
away
that
woman
she
has
been
here
little
more
than
half
an
hour
and
i
had
no
expectation
she
would
come
this
evening
you
love
me
just
a
little
then
marquise
that
is
not
the
question
now
it
is
of
your
danger
how
are
your
affairs
going
on
i
am
going
this
evening
to
get
my
friends
out
of
the
prisons
of
the
palais
how
will
you
do
that
by
buying
and
bribing
the
governor
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
can
i
assist
you
without
injuring
you
oh
marquise
it
would
be
a
signal
service
but
how
can
you
be
employed
without
your
being
compromised
now
never
shall
my
life
my
power
or
even
my
liberty
be
purchased
at
the
expense
of
a
single
tear
from
your
eyes
or
of
one
frown
of
pain
upon
your
brow
monseigneur
no
more
such
words
they
bewilder
me
i
have
been
culpable
in
trying
to
serve
you
without
calculating
the
extent
of
what
i
was
doing
i
love
you
in
reality
as
a
tender
friend
and
as
a
friend
i
am
grateful
for
your
delicate
attentions
but
alas
alas
you
will
never
find
a
mistress
in
me
marquise
cried
fouquet
in
a
tone
of
despair
why
not
because
you
are
too
much
beloved
said
the
young
woman
in
a
low
voice
because
you
are
too
much
beloved
by
too
many
people
because
the
splendor
of
glory
and
fortune
wound
my
eyes
whilst
the
darkness
of
sorrow
attracts
them
because
in
short
i
who
have
repulsed
you
in
your
proud
magnificence
i
who
scarcely
looked
at
you
in
your
splendor
i
came
like
a
mad
woman
to
throw
myself
as
it
were
into
your
arms
when
i
saw
a
misfortune
hovering
over
your
head
you
understand
me
now
monseigneur
become
happy
again
that
i
may
remain
chaste
in
heart
and
in
thought
your
misfortune
entails
my
ruin
oh
madame
said
fouquet
with
an
emotion
he
had
never
before
felt
were
i
to
fall
to
the
lowest
degree
of
human
misery
and
hear
from
your
mouth
that
word
which
you
now
refuse
me
that
day
madame
you
will
be
mistaken
in
your
noble
egotism
that
day
you
will
fancy
you
are
consoling
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
and
you
will
have
said
i
love
you
to
the
most
illustrious
the
most
delighted
the
most
triumphant
of
the
happy
beings
of
this
world
he
was
still
at
her
feet
kissing
her
hand
when
pelisson
entered
precipitately
crying
in
very
monseigneur
madame
for
heaven
s
sake
excuse
me
monseigneur
you
have
been
here
half
an
hour
oh
do
not
both
look
at
me
so
reproachfully
madame
pray
who
is
that
lady
who
left
your
house
soon
after
monseigneur
came
in
madame
vanel
said
fouquet
ha
cried
pelisson
i
was
sure
of
that
well
what
then
why
she
got
into
her
carriage
looking
deadly
pale
what
consequence
is
that
to
me
yes
but
what
she
said
to
her
coachman
is
of
consequence
to
you
kind
heaven
cried
the
marquise
what
was
that
to
m
colbert
s
said
pelisson
in
a
hoarse
voice
bon
dieu
begone
begone
monseigneur
replied
the
marquise
pushing
fouquet
out
of
the
salon
whilst
pelisson
dragged
him
by
the
hand
am
i
then
indeed
said
the
superintendent
become
a
child
to
be
frightened
by
a
shadow
you
are
a
giant
said
the
marquise
whom
a
viper
is
trying
to
bite
in
the
heel
pelisson
continued
to
drag
fouquet
to
the
carriage
to
the
palais
at
full
speed
cried
pelisson
to
the
coachman
the
horses
set
off
like
lightening
no
obstacle
relaxed
their
pace
for
an
instant
only
at
the
arcade
as
they
were
coming
out
upon
the
place
de
greve
a
long
file
of
horsemen
barring
the
narrow
passage
stopped
the
carriage
of
the
superintendent
there
was
no
means
of
forcing
this
barrier
it
was
necessary
to
wait
till
the
mounted
archers
of
the
watch
for
it
was
they
who
stopped
the
way
had
passed
with
the
heavy
carriage
they
were
escorting
and
which
ascended
rapidly
towards
the
place
baudoyer
fouquet
and
pelisson
took
no
further
account
of
this
circumstance
beyond
deploring
the
minute
s
delay
they
had
thus
to
submit
to
they
entered
the
habitation
of
the
concierge
du
palais
five
minutes
after
that
officer
was
still
walking
about
in
the
front
court
at
the
name
of
fouquet
whispered
in
his
ear
by
pelisson
the
governor
eagerly
approached
the
carriage
and
hat
in
hand
was
profuse
in
his
attentions
what
an
honor
for
me
monseigneur
said
he
one
word
monsieur
le
governeur
will
you
take
the
trouble
to
get
into
my
carriage
the
officer
placed
himself
opposite
fouquet
in
the
coach
monsieur
said
fouquet
i
have
a
service
to
ask
of
you
speak
monseigneur
a
service
that
will
be
compromising
for
you
monsieur
but
which
will
assure
to
you
forever
my
protection
and
my
friendship
were
it
to
cast
myself
into
the
fire
for
you
monseigneur
i
would
do
it
that
is
well
said
fouquet
what
i
require
is
much
more
simple
that
being
so
monseigneur
what
is
it
to
conduct
me
to
the
chamber
of
messieurs
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
will
monseigneur
have
the
kindness
to
say
for
what
purpose
i
will
tell
you
that
in
their
presence
monsieur
at
the
same
time
that
i
will
give
you
ample
means
of
palliating
this
escape
escape
why
then
monseigneur
does
not
know
what
that
messieurs
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
are
no
longer
here
since
when
cried
fouquet
in
great
agitation
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
whither
have
they
gone
then
to
vincennes
to
the
donjon
who
took
them
from
here
an
order
from
the
king
oh
woe
woe
exclaimed
fouquet
striking
his
forehead
woe
and
without
saying
a
single
word
more
to
the
governor
he
threw
himself
back
into
his
carriage
despair
in
his
heart
and
death
on
his
countenance
well
said
pelisson
with
great
anxiety
our
friends
are
lost
colbert
is
conveying
them
to
the
donjon
they
crossed
our
path
under
the
arcade
pelisson
struck
as
by
a
thunderbolt
made
no
reply
with
a
single
reproach
he
would
have
killed
his
master
where
is
monseigneur
going
said
the
footman
home
to
paris
you
pelisson
return
to
and
bring
the
abbe
fouquet
to
me
within
an
hour
begone
chapter
lx
plan
of
battle
the
night
was
already
far
advanced
when
the
abbe
fouquet
joined
his
brother
gourville
had
accompanied
him
these
three
men
pale
with
dread
of
future
events
resembled
less
three
powers
of
the
day
than
three
conspirators
united
by
one
single
thought
of
violence
fouquet
walked
for
a
long
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
striking
his
hands
one
against
the
other
at
length
taking
courage
in
the
midst
of
a
deep
sigh
abbe
said
he
you
were
speaking
to
me
only
of
certain
people
you
maintain
yes
monsieur
replied
the
abbe
tell
me
precisely
who
are
these
people
the
abbe
hesitated
come
no
fear
i
am
not
threatening
no
romancing
for
i
am
not
joking
since
you
demand
the
truth
monseigneur
here
it
is
i
have
a
hundred
and
twenty
friends
or
companions
of
pleasure
who
are
sworn
to
me
as
the
thief
is
to
the
gallows
and
you
think
you
can
depend
on
them
entirely
and
you
will
not
compromise
yourself
i
will
not
even
make
my
appearance
are
they
men
of
resolution
they
would
burn
paris
if
i
promised
them
they
should
not
be
burnt
in
turn
the
thing
i
ask
of
you
abbe
said
fouquet
wiping
the
sweat
which
fell
from
his
brow
is
to
throw
your
hundred
and
twenty
men
upon
the
people
i
will
point
out
to
you
at
a
certain
moment
given
is
it
possible
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
such
a
thing
has
happened
to
them
monseigneur
that
is
well
but
would
these
bandits
attack
an
armed
force
they
are
used
to
that
then
get
your
hundred
and
twenty
men
together
abbe
directly
but
where
on
the
road
to
vincennes
at
two
o
clock
precisely
to
carry
off
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
there
will
be
blows
to
be
got
a
number
no
doubt
are
you
afraid
not
for
myself
but
for
you
your
men
will
know
then
what
they
have
to
do
they
are
too
intelligent
not
to
guess
it
now
a
minister
who
gets
up
a
riot
against
his
king
exposes
himself
of
what
importance
is
that
to
you
i
pray
besides
if
i
fall
you
fall
with
me
it
would
then
be
more
prudent
monsieur
not
to
stir
in
the
affair
and
leave
the
king
to
take
this
little
satisfaction
think
well
of
this
abbe
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
at
vincennes
are
a
prelude
of
ruin
for
my
house
i
repeat
it
i
arrested
you
will
be
imprisoned
i
imprisoned
you
will
be
exiled
monsieur
i
am
at
your
orders
have
you
any
to
give
me
what
i
told
you
i
wish
that
the
two
financiers
of
whom
they
mean
to
make
victims
whilst
there
remain
so
many
criminals
unpunished
should
be
snatched
from
the
fury
of
my
enemies
take
your
measures
accordingly
is
it
possible
it
is
possible
describe
your
plan
it
is
of
rich
simplicity
the
ordinary
guard
at
executions
consists
of
twelve
archers
there
will
be
a
hundred
i
reckon
so
i
even
say
more
there
will
be
two
hundred
then
your
hundred
and
twenty
men
will
not
be
enough
pardon
me
in
every
crowd
composed
of
a
hundred
thousand
spectators
there
are
ten
thousand
bandits
or
only
they
dare
not
take
the
initiative
well
there
will
then
be
on
the
place
de
greve
which
i
choose
as
my
ten
thousand
auxiliaries
to
my
hundred
and
twenty
men
the
attack
commenced
by
the
latter
the
others
will
finish
it
that
all
appears
feasible
but
what
will
be
done
with
regard
to
the
prisoners
upon
the
place
de
greve
this
they
must
be
thrust
into
some
house
that
will
make
a
siege
necessary
to
get
them
out
again
and
stop
here
is
another
idea
more
sublime
still
certain
houses
have
two
issues
one
upon
the
place
and
the
other
into
the
rue
de
la
mortellerie
or
la
vannerie
or
la
tixeranderie
the
prisoners
entering
by
one
door
will
go
out
at
another
yes
but
fix
upon
something
positive
i
am
seeking
to
do
so
and
i
cried
fouquet
i
have
found
it
listen
to
what
has
occurred
to
me
at
this
moment
i
am
listening
fouquet
made
a
sign
to
gourville
who
appeared
to
understand
one
of
my
friends
lends
me
sometimes
the
keys
of
a
house
which
he
rents
rue
baudoyer
the
spacious
gardens
of
which
extend
behind
a
certain
house
on
the
place
de
greve
that
is
the
place
for
us
said
the
abbe
what
house
a
cabaret
pretty
well
frequented
whose
sign
represents
the
image
of
notre
dame
i
know
it
said
the
abbe
this
cabaret
has
windows
opening
upon
the
place
a
place
of
exit
into
the
court
which
must
abut
upon
the
gardens
of
my
friend
by
a
door
of
communication
good
said
the
abbe
enter
by
the
cabaret
take
the
prisoners
in
defend
the
door
while
you
enable
them
to
fly
by
the
garden
and
the
place
baudoyer
that
is
all
plain
monsieur
you
would
make
an
excellent
general
like
monsieur
le
prince
have
you
understood
me
perfectly
well
how
much
will
it
amount
to
to
make
your
bandits
all
drunk
with
wine
and
to
satisfy
them
with
gold
oh
monsieur
what
an
expression
oh
monsieur
if
they
heard
you
some
of
them
are
very
susceptible
i
mean
to
say
they
must
be
brought
to
the
point
where
they
can
not
tell
the
heavens
from
the
earth
for
i
shall
contend
with
the
king
and
when
i
fight
i
mean
to
conquer
please
to
understand
it
shall
be
done
monsieur
give
me
your
other
ideas
that
is
your
business
then
give
me
your
purse
gourville
count
a
hundred
thousand
livres
for
the
abbe
good
and
spare
nothing
did
you
not
say
nothing
that
is
well
monseigneur
objected
gourville
if
this
should
be
known
we
should
lose
our
heads
eh
gourville
replied
fouquet
purple
with
anger
you
excite
my
pity
speak
for
yourself
if
you
please
my
head
does
not
shake
in
that
manner
upon
my
shoulders
now
abbe
is
everything
arranged
everything
at
two
o
clock
at
twelve
because
it
will
be
necessary
to
prepare
our
auxiliaries
in
a
secret
manner
that
is
true
do
not
spare
the
wine
of
the
cabaretier
i
will
spare
neither
his
wine
nor
his
house
replied
the
abbe
with
a
sneering
laugh
i
have
my
plan
i
tell
you
leave
me
to
set
it
in
operation
and
you
shall
see
where
shall
you
be
yourself
everywhere
nowhere
and
how
shall
i
receive
information
by
a
courier
whose
horse
shall
be
kept
in
the
very
same
garden
of
your
friend
a
propos
the
name
of
your
friend
fouquet
looked
again
at
gourville
the
latter
came
to
the
succor
of
his
master
saying
the
name
is
of
no
importance
fouquet
continued
accompany
monsieur
l
abbe
for
several
reasons
but
the
house
is
easily
to
be
known
the
in
the
front
a
garden
the
only
one
in
the
quarter
behind
the
text
in
the
print
copy
is
corrupt
at
this
suggested
reading
in
brackets
is
by
john
bursey
good
good
i
will
go
and
give
notice
to
my
soldiers
accompany
him
gourville
said
fouquet
and
count
him
down
the
money
one
moment
abbe
one
moment
gourville
what
name
will
be
given
to
this
carrying
off
a
very
natural
one
monsieur
the
riot
the
riot
on
account
of
what
for
if
ever
the
people
of
paris
are
disposed
to
pay
their
court
to
the
king
it
is
when
he
hangs
financiers
i
will
manage
that
said
the
abbe
yes
but
you
may
manage
it
badly
and
people
will
guess
not
at
all
not
at
all
i
have
another
idea
what
is
that
my
men
shall
cry
out
colbert
vive
colbert
and
shall
throw
themselves
upon
the
prisoners
as
if
they
would
tear
them
in
pieces
and
shall
force
them
from
the
gibbets
as
too
mild
a
punishment
ah
that
is
an
idea
said
gourville
peste
monsieur
l
abbe
what
an
imagination
you
have
monsieur
we
are
worthy
of
our
family
replied
the
abbe
proudly
strange
fellow
murmured
fouquet
then
he
added
that
is
ingenious
carry
it
out
but
shed
no
blood
gourville
and
the
abbe
set
off
together
with
their
heads
full
of
the
meditated
riot
the
superintendent
laid
himself
down
upon
some
cushions
half
valiant
with
respect
to
the
sinister
projects
of
the
morrow
half
dreaming
of

chapter
lxi
the
cabaret
of
the
at
two
o
clock
the
next
day
fifty
thousand
spectators
had
taken
their
position
upon
the
place
around
the
two
gibbets
which
had
been
elevated
between
the
quai
de
la
greve
and
the
quai
pelletier
one
close
to
the
other
with
their
backs
to
the
embankment
of
the
river
in
the
morning
also
all
the
sworn
criers
of
the
good
city
of
paris
had
traversed
the
quarters
of
the
city
particularly
the
halles
and
the
faubourgs
announcing
with
their
hoarse
and
indefatigable
voices
the
great
justice
done
by
the
king
upon
two
speculators
two
thieves
devourers
of
the
people
and
these
people
whose
interests
were
so
warmly
looked
after
in
order
not
to
fail
in
respect
for
their
king
quitted
shops
stalls
and
atliers
to
go
and
evince
a
little
gratitude
to
louis
absolutely
like
invited
guests
who
feared
to
commit
an
impoliteness
in
not
repairing
to
the
house
of
him
who
had
invited
them
according
to
the
tenor
of
the
sentence
which
the
criers
read
aloud
and
incorrectly
two
farmers
of
the
revenues
monopolists
of
money
dilapidators
of
the
royal
provisions
extortioners
and
forgers
were
about
to
undergo
capital
punishment
on
the
place
de
greve
with
their
names
blazoned
over
their
heads
according
to
their
sentence
as
to
those
names
the
sentence
made
no
mention
of
them
the
curiosity
of
the
parisians
was
at
its
height
and
as
we
have
said
an
immense
crowd
waited
with
feverish
impatience
the
hour
fixed
for
the
execution
the
news
had
already
spread
that
the
prisoners
transferred
to
the
chateau
of
vincennes
would
be
conducted
from
that
prison
to
the
place
de
greve
consequently
the
faubourg
and
the
rue
saint
antoine
were
crowded
for
the
population
of
paris
in
those
days
of
great
executions
was
divided
into
two
categories
those
who
came
to
see
the
condemned
pass
these
were
of
timid
and
mild
hearts
but
philosophically
curious
and
those
who
wished
to
see
the
condemned
die
these
had
hearts
that
hungered
for
sensation
on
this
day
d
artagnan
received
his
last
instructions
from
the
king
and
made
his
adieus
to
his
friends
the
number
of
whom
was
at
the
moment
reduced
to
planchet
then
he
traced
the
plan
of
his
day
as
every
busy
man
whose
moments
are
counted
ought
to
do
because
he
appreciates
their
importance
my
departure
is
to
be
said
he
at
break
of
day
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
have
then
fifteen
hours
before
me
take
from
them
the
six
hours
of
sleep
which
are
indispensable
for
me
six
one
hour
for
repasts
seven
one
hour
for
a
farewell
visit
to
athos
eight
two
hours
for
chance
circumstances
total
ten
there
are
then
five
hours
left
one
hour
to
get
my
money
that
is
to
have
payment
refused
by
fouquet
another
hour
to
go
and
receive
my
money
of
colbert
together
with
his
questions
and
grimaces
one
hour
to
look
over
my
clothes
and
arms
and
get
my
boots
cleaned
i
still
have
two
hours
left
mordioux
how
rich
i
am
and
so
saying
d
artagnan
felt
a
strange
joy
a
joy
of
youth
a
perfume
of
those
great
and
happy
years
of
former
times
mount
into
his
brain
and
intoxicate
him
during
these
two
hours
i
will
go
said
the
musketeer
and
take
my
quarter
s
rent
of
the
that
will
be
pleasant
three
hundred
and
livres
mordioux
but
that
is
astonishing
if
the
poor
man
who
has
but
one
livre
in
his
pocket
found
a
livre
and
twelve
deniers
that
would
be
justice
that
would
be
excellent
but
never
does
such
a
godsend
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
poor
man
the
rich
man
on
the
contrary
makes
himself
revenue
with
his
money
which
he
does
not
even
touch
here
are
three
hundred
and
livres
which
fall
to
me
from
heaven
i
will
go
then
to
the
and
drink
a
glass
of
spanish
wine
with
my
tenant
which
he
can
not
fail
to
offer
me
but
order
must
be
observed
monsieur
d
artagnan
order
must
be
observed
let
us
organize
our
time
then
and
distribute
the
employment
of
it
art
athos
art
the
art
fouquet
art
colbert
art
supper
art
clothes
boots
horse
portmanteau
art
and
last
sleep
in
consequence
of
this
arrangement
d
artagnan
went
straight
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
whom
modestly
and
ingenuously
he
related
a
part
of
his
fortunate
adventures
athos
had
not
been
without
uneasiness
on
the
subject
of
d
artagnan
s
visit
to
the
king
but
few
words
sufficed
for
an
explanation
of
that
athos
divined
that
louis
had
charged
d
artagnan
with
some
important
mission
and
did
not
even
make
an
effort
to
draw
the
secret
from
him
he
only
recommended
him
to
take
care
of
himself
and
offered
discreetly
to
accompany
him
if
that
were
desirable
but
my
dear
friend
said
d
artagnan
i
am
going
nowhere
what
you
come
and
bid
me
adieu
and
are
going
nowhere
oh
yes
yes
replied
d
artagnan
coloring
a
little
i
am
going
to
make
an
acquisition
that
is
quite
another
thing
then
i
change
my
formula
instead
of
do
not
get
yourself
killed
i
will
say
do
not
get
yourself
my
friend
i
will
inform
you
if
i
set
eyes
on
any
property
that
pleases
me
and
shall
expect
you
will
favor
me
with
your
opinion
yes
yes
said
athos
too
delicate
to
permit
himself
even
the
consolation
of
a
smile
raoul
imitated
the
paternal
reserve
but
d
artagnan
thought
it
would
appear
too
mysterious
to
leave
his
friends
under
a
pretense
without
even
telling
them
the
route
he
was
about
to
take
i
have
chosen
le
mans
said
he
to
athos
it
is
a
good
country
excellent
my
friend
replied
the
count
without
making
him
observe
that
le
mans
was
in
the
same
directions
as
la
touraine
and
that
by
waiting
two
days
at
most
he
might
travel
with
a
friend
but
d
artagnan
more
embarrassed
than
the
count
dug
at
every
explanation
deeper
into
the
mud
into
which
he
sank
by
degrees
i
shall
set
out
at
daybreak
said
he
at
last
till
that
time
will
you
come
with
me
raoul
yes
monsieur
le
chevalier
said
the
young
man
if
monsieur
le
comte
does
not
want
me
no
raoul
i
am
to
have
an
audience
of
monsieur
the
king
s
brother
that
is
all
i
have
to
do
raoul
asked
grimaud
for
his
sword
which
the
old
man
brought
him
immediately
now
then
added
d
artagnan
opening
his
arms
to
athos
adieu
my
dear
friend
athos
held
him
in
a
long
embrace
and
the
musketeer
who
knew
his
discretion
so
well
murmured
in
his
ear
an
affair
of
state
to
which
athos
only
replied
by
a
pressure
of
the
hand
still
more
significant
they
then
separated
raoul
took
the
arm
of
his
old
friend
who
led
him
along
the
rue
i
an
conducting
you
to
the
abode
of
the
god
plutus
said
d
artagnan
to
the
young
man
prepare
yourself
the
whole
day
you
will
witness
the
piling
up
of
crowns
heavens
how
i
am
changed
oh
what
numbers
of
people
there
are
in
the
street
said
raoul
is
there
a
procession
asked
d
artagnan
of
a
monsieur
it
is
a
hanging
replied
the
man
what
a
hanging
at
the
greve
said
d
artagnan
yes
monsieur
the
devil
take
the
rogue
who
gets
himself
hung
the
day
i
want
to
go
and
take
my
rent
cried
d
artagnan
raoul
did
you
ever
see
anybody
hung
never
monsieur
thank
god
oh
how
young
that
sounds
if
you
were
on
guard
in
the
trenches
as
i
was
and
a
spy
but
pardon
me
raoul
i
am
doting
you
are
quite
right
it
is
a
hideous
sight
to
see
a
person
hung
at
what
hour
do
they
hang
them
monsieur
if
you
please
monsieur
replied
the
stranger
respectfully
delighted
at
joining
conversation
with
two
men
of
the
sword
it
will
take
place
at
about
three
o
clock
aha
it
is
now
only
one
let
us
step
out
we
shall
be
there
in
time
to
touch
my
three
hundred
and
livres
and
get
away
before
the
arrival
of
the
malefactor
malefactors
monsieur
continued
the
bourgeois
there
are
two
of
them
monsieur
i
return
to
you
many
thanks
said
d
artagnan
who
as
he
grew
older
had
become
polite
to
a
degree
drawing
raoul
along
he
directed
his
course
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
la
greve
without
that
great
experience
musketeers
have
of
a
crowd
to
which
were
joined
an
irresistible
strength
of
wrist
and
an
uncommon
suppleness
of
shoulders
our
two
travelers
would
not
have
arrived
at
their
place
of
destination
they
followed
the
line
of
the
quai
which
they
had
gained
on
quitting
the
rue
where
they
left
athos
d
artagnan
went
first
his
elbow
his
wrist
his
shoulder
formed
three
wedges
which
he
knew
how
to
insinuate
with
skill
into
the
groups
to
make
them
split
and
separate
like
firewood
he
made
use
sometimes
of
the
hilt
of
his
sword
as
an
additional
help
introducing
it
between
ribs
that
were
too
rebellious
making
it
take
the
part
of
a
lever
or
crowbar
to
separate
husband
from
wife
uncle
from
nephew
and
brother
from
brother
and
all
that
was
done
so
naturally
and
with
such
gracious
smiles
that
people
must
have
had
ribs
of
bronze
not
to
cry
thank
you
when
the
wrist
made
its
play
or
hearts
of
diamond
not
to
be
enchanted
when
such
a
bland
smile
enlivened
the
lips
of
the
musketeer
raoul
following
his
friend
cajoled
the
women
who
admired
his
beauty
pushed
back
the
men
who
felt
the
rigidity
of
his
muscles
and
both
opened
thanks
to
these
maneuvers
the
compact
and
muddy
tide
of
the
populace
they
arrived
in
sight
of
the
two
gibbets
from
which
raoul
turned
away
his
eyes
in
disgust
as
for
d
artagnan
he
did
not
even
see
them
his
house
with
its
gabled
roof
its
windows
crowded
with
the
curious
attracted
and
even
absorbed
all
the
attention
he
was
capable
of
he
distinguished
in
the
place
and
around
the
houses
a
good
number
of
musketeers
on
leave
who
some
with
women
others
with
friends
awaited
the
crowning
ceremony
what
rejoiced
him
above
all
was
to
see
that
his
tenant
the
cabaretier
was
so
busy
he
hardly
knew
which
way
to
turn
three
lads
could
not
supply
the
drinkers
they
filled
the
shop
the
chambers
and
the
court
even
d
artagnan
called
raoul
s
attention
to
this
concourse
adding
the
fellow
will
have
no
excuse
for
not
paying
his
rent
look
at
those
drinkers
raoul
one
would
say
they
were
jolly
companions
mordioux
why
there
is
no
room
anywhere
d
artagnan
however
contrived
to
catch
hold
of
the
master
by
the
corner
of
his
apron
and
to
make
himself
known
to
him
ah
monsieur
le
chevalier
said
the
cabaretier
half
distracted
one
minute
if
you
please
i
have
here
a
hundred
mad
devils
turning
my
cellar
upside
down
the
cellar
if
you
like
but
not
the
oh
monsieur
your
and
a
half
pistoles
are
all
counted
out
ready
for
you
upstairs
in
my
chamber
but
there
are
in
that
chamber
thirty
customers
who
are
sucking
the
staves
of
a
little
barrel
of
oporto
which
i
tapped
for
them
this
very
morning
give
me
a
minute
only
a
minute
so
be
it
so
be
it
i
will
go
said
raoul
in
a
low
voice
to
d
artagnan
this
hilarity
is
vile
monsieur
replied
d
artagnan
sternly
you
will
please
to
remain
where
you
are
the
soldier
ought
to
familiarize
himself
with
all
kinds
of
spectacles
there
are
in
the
eye
when
it
is
young
fibers
which
we
must
learn
how
to
harden
and
we
are
not
truly
generous
and
good
save
from
the
moment
when
the
eye
has
become
hardened
and
the
heart
remains
tender
besides
my
little
raoul
would
you
leave
me
alone
here
that
would
be
very
wrong
of
you
look
there
is
yonder
in
the
lower
court
a
tree
and
under
the
shade
of
that
tree
we
shall
breathe
more
freely
than
in
this
hot
atmosphere
of
spilt
wine
from
the
spot
on
which
they
had
placed
themselves
the
two
new
guests
of
the
heard
the
hubbub
of
the
tide
of
people
and
lost
neither
a
cry
nor
a
gesture
of
the
drinkers
at
tables
in
the
cabaret
or
disseminated
in
the
chambers
if
d
artagnan
had
wished
to
place
himself
as
a
vidette
for
an
expedition
he
could
not
have
succeeded
better
the
tree
under
which
he
and
raoul
were
seated
covered
them
with
its
already
thick
foliage
it
was
a
low
thick
with
inclined
branches
that
cast
their
shade
over
a
table
so
dilapidated
the
drinkers
had
abandoned
it
we
said
that
from
this
post
d
artagnan
saw
everything
he
observed
the
goings
and
comings
of
the
waiters
the
arrival
of
fresh
drinkers
the
welcome
sometimes
friendly
sometimes
hostile
given
to
the
newcomers
by
others
already
installed
he
observed
all
this
to
amuse
himself
for
the
and
a
half
pistoles
were
a
long
time
coming
raoul
recalled
his
attention
to
it
monsieur
said
he
you
do
not
hurry
your
tenant
and
the
condemned
will
soon
be
here
there
will
then
be
such
a
press
we
shall
not
be
able
to
get
out
you
are
right
said
the
musketeer
hola
oh
somebody
there
mordioux
but
it
was
in
vain
he
cried
and
knocked
upon
the
wreck
of
the
old
table
which
fell
to
pieces
beneath
his
fist
nobody
came
d
artagnan
was
preparing
to
go
and
seek
the
cabaretier
himself
to
force
him
to
a
definite
explanation
when
the
door
of
the
court
in
which
he
was
with
raoul
a
door
which
communicated
with
the
garden
situated
at
the
back
opened
and
a
man
dressed
as
a
cavalier
with
his
sword
in
the
sheath
but
not
at
his
belt
crossed
the
court
without
closing
the
door
and
having
cast
an
oblique
glance
at
d
artagnan
and
his
companion
directed
his
course
towards
the
cabaret
itself
looking
about
in
all
directions
with
his
eyes
capable
of
piercing
walls
of
consciences
humph
said
d
artagnan
my
tenants
are
communicating
that
no
doubt
now
is
some
amateur
in
hanging
matters
at
the
same
moment
the
cries
and
disturbance
in
the
upper
chambers
ceased
silence
under
such
circumstances
surprises
more
than
a
twofold
increase
of
noise
d
artagnan
wished
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
this
sudden
silence
he
then
perceived
that
this
man
dressed
as
a
cavalier
had
just
entered
the
principal
chamber
and
was
haranguing
the
tipplers
who
all
listened
to
him
with
the
greatest
attention
d
artagnan
would
perhaps
have
heard
his
speech
but
for
the
dominant
noise
of
the
popular
clamors
which
made
a
formidable
accompaniment
to
the
harangue
of
the
orator
but
it
was
soon
finished
and
all
the
people
the
cabaret
contained
came
out
one
after
the
other
in
little
groups
so
that
there
only
remained
six
in
the
chamber
one
of
these
six
the
man
with
the
sword
took
the
cabaretier
aside
engaging
him
in
discourse
more
or
less
serious
whilst
the
others
lit
a
great
fire
in
the
a
circumstance
rendered
strange
by
the
fine
weather
and
the
heat
it
is
very
singular
said
d
artagnan
to
raoul
but
i
think
i
know
those
faces
yonder
don
t
you
think
you
can
smell
the
smoke
here
said
raoul
i
rather
think
i
can
smell
a
conspiracy
replied
d
artagnan
he
had
not
finished
speaking
when
four
of
these
men
came
down
into
the
court
and
without
the
appearance
of
any
bad
design
mounted
guard
at
the
door
of
communication
casting
at
intervals
glances
at
d
artagnan
which
signified
many
things
mordioux
said
d
artagnan
in
a
low
voice
there
is
something
going
on
are
you
curious
raoul
according
to
the
subject
chevalier
well
i
am
as
curious
as
an
old
woman
come
a
little
more
in
front
we
shall
get
a
better
view
of
the
place
i
would
lay
a
wager
that
view
will
be
something
curious
but
you
know
monsieur
le
chevalier
that
i
am
not
willing
to
become
a
passive
and
indifferent
spectator
of
the
death
of
the
two
poor
devils
and
i
then
do
you
think
i
am
a
savage
we
will
go
in
again
when
it
is
time
to
do
so
come
along
and
they
made
their
way
towards
the
front
of
the
house
and
placed
themselves
near
the
window
which
still
more
strangely
than
the
rest
remained
unoccupied
the
two
last
drinkers
instead
of
looking
out
at
this
window
kept
up
the
fire
on
seeing
d
artagnan
and
his
friend
enter
ah
ah
a
reinforcement
murmured
they
d
artagnan
jogged
raoul
s
elbow
yes
my
braves
a
reinforcement
said
he
cordieu
there
is
a
famous
fire
whom
are
you
going
to
cook
the
two
men
uttered
a
shout
of
jovial
laughter
and
instead
of
answering
threw
on
more
wood
d
artagnan
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
them
i
suppose
said
one
of
the
they
sent
you
to
tell
us
the
time
did
not
they
without
doubt
they
have
said
d
artagnan
anxious
to
know
what
was
going
on
why
should
i
be
here
else
if
it
were
not
for
that
then
place
yourself
at
the
window
if
you
please
and
observe
d
artagnan
smiled
in
his
mustache
made
a
sign
to
raoul
and
placed
himself
at
the
window
chapter
lxii
vive
colbert
the
spectacle
which
the
greve
now
presented
was
a
frightful
one
the
heads
leveled
by
the
perspective
extended
afar
thick
and
agitated
as
the
ears
of
corn
in
a
vast
plain
from
time
to
time
a
fresh
report
or
a
distant
rumor
made
the
heads
oscillate
and
thousands
of
eyes
flash
now
and
then
there
were
great
movements
all
those
ears
of
corn
bent
and
became
waves
more
agitated
than
those
of
the
ocean
which
rolled
from
the
extremities
to
the
center
and
beat
like
the
tides
against
the
hedge
of
archers
who
surrounded
the
gibbets
then
the
handles
of
the
halberds
were
let
fall
upon
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
rash
invaders
at
times
also
it
was
the
steel
as
well
as
the
wood
and
in
that
case
a
large
empty
circle
was
formed
around
the
guard
a
space
conquered
upon
the
extremities
which
underwent
in
their
turn
the
oppression
of
the
sudden
movement
which
drove
them
against
the
parapets
of
the
seine
from
the
window
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
place
d
artagnan
saw
with
interior
satisfaction
that
such
of
the
musketeers
and
guards
as
found
themselves
involved
in
the
crowd
were
able
with
blows
of
their
fists
and
the
hilts
of
theirs
swords
to
keep
room
he
even
remarked
that
they
had
succeeded
by
that
esprit
de
corps
which
doubles
the
strength
of
the
soldier
in
getting
together
in
one
group
to
the
amount
of
about
fifty
men
and
that
with
the
exception
of
a
dozen
stragglers
whom
he
still
saw
rolling
here
and
there
the
nucleus
was
complete
and
within
reach
of
his
voice
but
it
was
not
the
musketeers
and
guards
that
drew
the
attention
of
d
artagnan
around
the
gibbets
and
particularly
at
the
entrances
to
the
arcade
of
moved
a
noisy
mass
a
busy
mass
daring
faces
resolute
demeanors
were
to
be
seen
here
and
there
mingled
with
silly
faces
and
indifferent
demeanors
signals
were
exchanged
hands
given
and
taken
d
artagnan
remarked
among
the
groups
and
those
groups
the
most
animated
the
face
of
the
cavalier
whom
he
had
seen
enter
by
the
door
of
communication
from
his
garden
and
who
had
gone
upstairs
to
harangue
the
drinkers
that
man
was
organizing
troops
and
giving
orders
mordioux
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
i
was
not
deceived
i
know
that
man
it
is
menneville
what
the
devil
is
he
doing
here
a
distant
murmur
which
became
more
distinct
by
degrees
stopped
this
reflection
and
drew
his
attention
another
way
this
murmur
was
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
the
culprits
a
strong
picket
of
archers
preceded
them
and
appeared
at
the
angle
of
the
arcade
the
entire
crowd
now
joined
as
if
in
one
cry
all
the
cries
united
formed
one
immense
howl
d
artagnan
saw
raoul
was
becoming
pale
and
he
slapped
him
roughly
on
the
shoulder
the
turned
round
on
hearing
the
great
cry
and
asked
what
was
going
on
the
condemned
are
arrived
said
d
artagnan
that
s
well
replied
they
again
replenishing
the
fire
d
artagnan
looked
at
them
with
much
uneasiness
it
was
evident
that
these
men
who
were
making
such
a
fire
for
no
apparent
purpose
had
some
strange
intentions
the
condemned
appeared
upon
the
place
they
were
walking
the
executioner
before
them
whilst
fifty
archers
formed
a
hedge
on
their
right
and
their
left
both
were
dressed
in
black
they
appeared
pale
but
firm
they
looked
impatiently
over
the
people
s
heads
standing
on
at
every
step
d
artagnan
remarked
this
mordioux
cried
he
they
are
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
a
sight
of
the
gibbet
raoul
drew
back
without
however
having
the
power
to
leave
the
window
terror
even
has
its
attractions
to
the
death
to
the
death
cried
fifty
thousand
voices
yes
to
the
death
howled
a
hundred
frantic
others
as
if
the
great
mass
had
given
them
the
reply
to
the
halter
to
the
halter
cried
the
great
whole
vive
le

well
said
d
artagnan
this
is
droll
i
should
have
thought
it
was
colbert
who
had
caused
them
to
be
hung
there
was
at
this
moment
a
great
rolling
movement
in
the
crowd
which
stopped
for
a
moment
the
march
of
the
condemned
the
people
of
a
bold
and
resolute
mien
whom
d
artagnan
had
observed
by
dint
of
pressing
pushing
and
lifting
themselves
up
had
succeeded
in
almost
touching
the
hedge
of
archers
the
cortege
resumed
its
march
all
at
once
to
cries
of
vive
colbert
those
men
of
whom
d
artagnan
never
lost
sight
fell
upon
the
escort
which
in
vain
endeavored
to
stand
against
them
behind
these
men
was
the
crowd
then
commenced
amidst
a
frightful
tumult
as
frightful
a
confusion
this
time
there
was
something
more
than
cries
of
expectation
or
cries
of
joy
there
were
cries
of
pain
halberds
struck
men
down
swords
ran
through
them
muskets
were
discharged
at
them
the
confusion
became
then
so
great
that
d
artagnan
could
no
longer
distinguish
anything
then
from
this
chaos
suddenly
surged
something
like
a
visible
intention
like
a
will
pronounced
the
condemned
had
been
torn
from
the
hands
of
the
guards
and
were
being
dragged
towards
the
house
of
l
those
who
dragged
them
shouted
vive
colbert
the
people
hesitated
not
knowing
which
they
ought
to
fall
upon
the
archers
or
the
aggressors
what
stopped
the
people
was
that
those
who
cried
vive
colbert
began
to
cry
at
the
same
time
no
halter
no
halter
to
the
fire
to
the
fire
burn
the
thieves
burn
the
extortioners
this
cry
shouted
with
an
ensemble
obtained
enthusiastic
success
the
populace
had
come
to
witness
an
execution
and
here
was
an
opportunity
offered
them
of
performing
one
themselves
it
was
this
that
must
be
most
agreeable
to
the
populace
therefore
they
ranged
themselves
immediately
on
the
party
of
the
aggressors
against
the
archers
crying
with
the
minority
which
had
become
thanks
to
them
the
most
compact
majority
yes
yes
to
the
fire
with
the
thieves
vive

mordioux
exclaimed
d
artagnan
this
begins
to
look
serious
one
of
the
men
who
remained
near
the
chimney
approached
the
window
a
firebrand
in
his
hand
ah
ah
said
he
it
gets
warm
then
turning
to
his
companion
there
is
the
signal
added
he
and
he
immediately
applied
the
burning
brand
to
the
wainscoting
now
this
cabaret
of
the
was
not
a
very
newly
built
house
and
therefore
did
not
require
much
entreating
to
take
fire
in
a
second
the
boards
began
to
crackle
and
the
flames
arose
sparkling
to
the
ceiling
a
howling
from
without
replied
to
the
shouts
of
the
incendiaries
d
artagnan
who
had
not
seen
what
passed
from
being
engaged
at
the
window
felt
at
the
same
time
the
smoke
which
choked
him
and
the
fire
that
scorched
him
hola
cried
he
turning
round
is
the
fire
here
are
you
drunk
or
mad
my
masters
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
an
air
of
astonishment
in
what
asked
they
of
d
artagnan
was
it
not
a
thing
agreed
upon
a
thing
agreed
upon
that
you
should
burn
my
house
vociferated
d
artagnan
snatching
the
brand
from
the
hand
of
the
incendiary
and
striking
him
with
it
across
the
face
the
second
wanted
to
assist
his
comrade
but
raoul
seizing
him
by
the
middle
threw
him
out
of
the
window
whilst
d
artagnan
pushed
his
man
down
the
stairs
raoul
first
disengaged
tore
the
burning
wainscoting
down
and
threw
it
flaming
into
the
chamber
at
a
glance
d
artagnan
saw
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
from
the
fire
and
sprang
to
the
window
the
disorder
was
at
its
height
the
air
was
filled
with
simultaneous
cries
of
to
the
fire
to
the
death
to
the

to
the
stake

the
group
which
had
forced
the
culprits
from
the
hands
of
the
archers
had
drawn
close
to
the
house
which
appeared
to
be
the
goal
towards
which
they
dragged
them
menneville
was
at
the
head
of
this
group
shouting
louder
than
all
the
others
to
the
fire
to

d
artagnan
began
to
comprehend
what
was
meant
they
wanted
to
burn
the
condemned
and
his
house
was
to
serve
as
a
funeral

said
he
what

the
poor
devils
who
are
only
condemned
to

hung
that
is
infamous
before
the
door
however
the
mass
of
anxious
spectators
rolled
back
against
the
walls
had
become
more
thick
and
closed
up
the
way
menneville
and
his
men
who
were
dragging
along
the

were
within
ten
paces
of
the

there
now
remained
no
doubt
it
was
plainly
d
artagnan
s
house
that
was
their
object
d
artagnan
remembered
the
old
cry
always
so
effective
from
his
mouth
a
moi

shouted
he
with
the
voice
of
a
giant
with
one
of
those
voices
which
dominate
over
cannon
the
sea
the
tempest
a
moi
mousquetaires
and
suspending
himself
by
the
arm
from
the
balcony
he
allowed
himself
to
drop
amidst
the
crowd
which
began
to
draw
back
form
a
house
that
rained
men
raoul
was
on
the
ground
as
soon
as
he
both
sword
in

all
the
musketeers
on
the
place
heard
that
challenging
cry
all
turned
round
at
that
cry
and
recognized
d
artagnan
to
the
captain
to
the
captain
cried
they
in
their
turn
and
the
crowd
opened
before
them
as
though
before
the
prow
of
a
vessel
at
that
moment
d
artagnan
and
menneville
found
themselves
face
to
face
passage

cried
menneville
seeing
that
he
was
within
an
arm
s
length
from
the
door
no

here
said
d
artagnan
take
that
then
said
menneville
firing
his
pistol
almost
within
an
arm
s
length
but
before
the
cock
fell
d
artagnan
had
struck
up
menneville
s
arm
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
passed
the
blade
through
his
body
i
told
you
plainly
to
keep
yourself
quiet
said
d
artagnan
to
menneville
who
rolled
at
his
feet
passage
passage
cried
the
companions
of
menneville
at
first
terrified
but
soon
recovering
when
they
found
they
had
only
to
do
with
two
men
but
those
two
men
were
giants
the
swords
flew
about
in
their
hands
like
the
burning
glaive
of
the
archangel
they
pierce
with
its
point
strike
with
the
flat
cut
with
the
edge
every
stroke
brings
down
a
man
for
the
king
cried
d
artagnan
to
every
man
he
struck
at
that
is
to
say
to
every
man
that
fell
this
cry
became
the
charging
word
for
the
musketeers
who
guided
by
it
joined
d
artagnan
during
this
time
the
archers
recovering
from
the
panic
they
had
undergone
charge
the
aggressors
in
the
rear
and
regular
as
mill
strokes
overturn
or
knock
down
all
that
opposed
them
the
crowd
which
sees
swords
gleaming
and
drops
of
blood
flying
in
the
air
the
crowd
falls
back
and
crushes
itself
at
length
cries
for
mercy
and
of
despair
resound
that
is
the
farewell
of
the
vanquished
the
two
condemned
are
again
in
the
hands
of
the
archers
d
artagnan
approaches
them
seeing
them
pale
and
sinking
console
yourselves
poor
men
said
he
you
will
not
undergo
the
frightful
torture
with
which
these
wretches
threatened
you
the
king
has
condemned
you
to
be
hung
you
shall
only
be
hung
go
on
hang
them
and
it
will
be
over
there
is
no
longer
anything
going
on
at
the
the
fire
has
been
extinguished
with
two
tuns
of
wine
in
default
of
water
the
conspirators
have
fled
by
the
garden
the
archers
are
dragging
the
culprits
to
the
gibbets
from
this
moment
the
affair
did
not
occupy
much
time
the
executioner
heedless
about
operating
according
to
the
rules
of
the
art
made
such
haste
that
he
dispatched
the
condemned
in
a
couple
of
minutes
in
the
meantime
the
people
gathered
around
d
artagnan
they
felicitated
they
cheered
him
he
wiped
his
brow
streaming
with
sweat
and
his
sword
streaming
with
blood
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
seeing
menneville
writhing
at
his
feet
in
the
last
convulsions
and
while
raoul
turned
away
his
eyes
in
compassion
he
pointed
to
the
musketeers
the
gibbets
laden
with
their
melancholy
fruit
poor
devils
said
he
i
hope
they
died
blessing
me
for
i
saved
them
with
great
difficulty
these
words
caught
the
ear
of
menneville
at
the
moment
when
he
himself
was
breathing
his
last
sigh
a
dark
ironical
smile
flitted
across
his
lips
he
wished
to
reply
but
the
effort
hastened
the
snapping
of
the
chord
of
life
he
expired
oh
all
this
is
very
frightful
murmured
raoul
let
us
begone
monsieur

chevalier

are
not
wounded

and
bloody
scene
was
passing
on
the
greve
several
men
barricaded
behind
the
gate
of
communication
with
the
garden
replaced
their
swords
in
their
sheaths
assisted
one
among
them
to
mount
a
ready
saddled
horse
which
was
waiting
in
the
garden
and
like
a
flock
of
startled
birds
fled
in
all
directions
some
climbing
the
walls
others
rushing
out
at

gates
with
all
the
fury
of

panic

mounted

and
gave
him
the

so
sharply
that

was
near
leaping

crossed

like
lightening
before
the

in

riding

knocking
down
all

in

minutes
after

out

than

the

at
the
clatter
of

on

at

of

opened
and

appeared
in
the
chamber
pale
distracted
with
lips
half
opened
breathing
a
cry
of
grief
and
anger
he
stopped
upon
the
threshold
to
listen
to
what
was
addressed
from
the

to
the
window
miserable

and
caused
a

up
out
of

like
the
guardian
angel
of
the
superintendent
pressing
one
finger
on
his
lips
to
enjoin
observation
even
amidst
the
bursts
of
his
grief
the
minister
resumed
all
the
serenity
that
human
strength
left
at
the
disposal
of
a
heart
half
broken
with
sorrow
danicamp
appeared
make
your
report
said
gourville
monsieur
replied
the
messenger
we
received
orders
to
carry
off
the
prisoners
and
to
cry
vive
colbert
whilst
carrying
them
off
to
burn
them
alive
was
it
not
abbe
interrupted
gourville
yes
yes
the
order
was
given
to
menneville
menneville
knew
what
was
to
be
done
and
menneville
is
dead
this
news
appeared
rather
to
reassure
gourville
than
to
sadden
him
yes
certainly
to
burn
them
alive
said
the
abbe
eagerly
granted
monsieur
granted
said
the
man
looking
into
the
eyes
and
the
faces
of
the
two
interlocutors
to
ascertain
what
there
was
profitable
or
disadvantageous
to
himself
in
telling
the
truth
now
proceed
said
gourville
the
prisoners
cried
danicamp
were
brought
to
the
greve
and
the
people
in
a
fury
insisted
upon
their
being
burnt
instead
of
being
hung
and
the
people
were
right
said
the
abbe
go
on
but
resumed
the
man
at
the
moment
the
archers
were
broken
at
the
moment
the
fire
was
set
to
one
of
the
houses
of
the
place
destined
to
serve
as
a
for
the
guilty
this
fury
this
demon
this
giant
of
whom
i
told
you
and
who
we
had
been
informed
was
the
proprietor
of
the
house
in
question
aided
by
a
young
man
who
accompanied
him
threw
out
of
the
window
those
who
kept
the
fire
called
to
his
assistance
the
musketeers
who
were
in
the
crowd
leaped
himself
from
the
window
of
the
first
story
into
the
place
and
plied
his
sword
so
desperately
that
the
victory
was
restored
to
the
archers
the
prisoners
were
retaken
and
menneville
killed
when
once
recaptured
the
condemned
were
executed
in
three
minutes
fouquet
in
spite
of
his
could
not
prevent
a
deep
groan
escaping
him
and
this
man
the
proprietor
of
the
house
what
is
his
name
said
the
abbe
i
can
not
tell
you
not
having
even
been
able
to
get
sight
of
him
my
post
had
been
appointed
in
the
garden
and
i
remained
at
my
post
only
the
affair
was
related
to
me
as
i
repeat
it
i
was
ordered
when
once
the
affair
was
at
an
end
to
come
at
best
speed
and
announce
to
you
the
manner
in
which
it
finished
according
to
this
order
i
set
out
full
gallop
and
here
i
am
very
well
monsieur
we
have
nothing
else
to
ask
of
you
said
the
abbe
more
and
more
dejected
in
proportion
as
the
moment
approached
for
finding
himself
alone
with
his
brother
have
you
been
paid
asked
gourville
partly
monsieur
replied
danicamp
here
are
twenty
pistols
begone
monsieur
and
never
forget
to
defend
as
this
time
has
been
done
the
true
interests
of
the
king
yes
monsieur
said
the
man
bowing
and
pocketing
the
money
after
which
he
went
out
scarcely
had
the
door
closed
after
him
when
fouquet
who
had
remained
motionless
advanced
with
a
rapid
step
and
stood
between
the
abbe
and
gourville
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
opened
their
mouths
to
speak
to
him
no
excuses
said
he
no
recriminations
against
anybody
if
i
had
not
been
a
false
friend
i
should
not
have
confided
to
any
one
the
care
of
delivering
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
i
alone
am
guilty
to
me
alone
are
reproaches
and
remorse
due
leave
me
abbe
and
yet
monsieur
you
will
not
prevent
me
replied
the
latter
from
endeavoring
to
find
out
the
miserable
fellow
who
has
intervened
to
the
advantage
of
colbert
in
this
so
affair
for
if
it
is
good
policy
to
love
our
friends
dearly
i
do
not
believe
that
is
bad
which
consists
in
obstinately
pursuing
our
enemies
a
truce
to
policy
abbe
begone
i
beg
of
you
and
do
not
let
me
hear
any
more
of
you
till
i
send
for
you
what
we
most
need
is
circumspection
and
silence
you
have
a
terrible
example
before
you
gentlemen
no
reprisals
i
forbid
them
there
are
no
orders
grumbled
the
abbe
which
will
prevent
me
from
avenging
a
family
affront
upon
the
guilty
person
and
i
cried
fouquet
in
that
imperative
tone
to
which
one
feels
there
is
nothing
to
reply
if
you
entertain
one
thought
one
single
thought
which
is
not
the
absolute
expression
of
my
will
i
will
have
you
cast
into
the
bastile
two
hours
after
that
thought
has
manifested
itself
regulate
your
conduct
accordingly
abbe
the
abbe
colored
and
bowed
fouquet
made
a
sign
to
gourville
to
follow
him
and
was
already
directing
his
steps
towards
his
cabinet
when
the
usher
announced
with
a
loud
voice
monsieur
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
who
is
he
said
fouquet
negligently
to
gourville
an
of
his
majesty
s
musketeers
replied
gourville
in
the
same
tone
fouquet
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
reflect
and
resumed
his
walk
i
beg
your
pardon
monseigneur
said
gourville
but
i
have
remembered
this
brave
man
has
quitted
the
king
s
service
and
probably
comes
to
receive
an
installment
of
some
pension
or
other
devil
take
him
said
fouquet
why
does
he
choose
his
opportunity
so
ill
permit
me
then
monseigneur
to
announce
your
refusal
to
him
for
he
is
one
of
my
acquaintance
and
is
a
man
whom
in
our
present
circumstances
it
would
be
better
to
have
as
a
friend
than
an
enemy
answer
him
as
you
please
said
fouquet
eh
good
lord
said
the
abbe
still
full
of
malice
like
an
egotistical
man
tell
him
there
is
no
money
particularly
for
musketeers
but
scarcely
had
the
abbe
uttered
this
imprudent
speech
when
the
partly
open
door
was
thrown
back
and
d
artagnan
appeared
eh
monsieur
fouquet
said
he
i
was
well
aware
there
was
no
money
for
musketeers
here
therefore
i
did
not
come
to
obtain
any
but
to
have
it
refused
that
being
done
receive
my
thanks
i
give
you
and
will
go
and
seek
it
at
m
colbert
s
and
he
went
out
making
an
easy
bow
gourville
said
fouquet
run
after
that
man
and
bring
him
back
gourville
obeyed
and
overtook
d
artagnan
on
the
stairs
d
artagnan
hearing
steps
behind
him
turned
round
and
perceived
gourville
mordioux
my
dear
monsieur
said
he
there
are
sad
lessons
which
you
gentlemen
of
finance
teach
us
i
come
to
fouquet
to
receive
a
sum
accorded
by
his
majesty
and
i
am
received
like
a
mendicant
who
comes
to
ask
charity
or
a
thief
who
comes
to
steal
a
piece
of
plate
but
you
pronounced
the
name
of
colbert
my
dear
d
artagnan
you
said
you
were
going
to
m
colbert
s
i
certainly
am
going
there
were
it
only
to
ask
satisfaction
of
the
people
who
try
to
burn
houses
crying
vive
colbert
gourville
pricked
up
his
ears
oh
oh
said
he
you
allude
to
what
has
just
happened
at
the
greve
yes
certainly
and
in
what
did
that
which
has
taken
place
concern
you
what
do
you
ask
me
whether
it
concerns
me
or
does
not
concern
me
if
colbert
pleases
to
make
a
of
my
house
so
ho
your
house
was
it
your
house
they
wanted
to
burn
pardieu
was
it
is
the
cabaret
of
the
yours
then
it
has
been
this
week
well
then
are
you
the
brave
captain
are
you
the
valiant
blade
who
dispersed
those
who
wished
to
burn
the
condemned
my
dear
monsieur
gourville
put
yourself
in
my
place
i
was
an
agent
of
the
public
force
and
a
landlord
too
as
a
captain
it
is
my
duty
to
have
the
orders
of
the
king
accomplished
as
a
proprietor
it
is
to
my
interest
my
house
should
not
be
burnt
i
have
at
the
same
time
attended
to
the
laws
of
interest
and
duty
in
replacing
messieurs
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
in
the
hands
of
the
archers
then
it
was
you
who
threw
the
man
out
of
the
window
it
was
i
myself
replied
d
artagnan
modestly
and
you
who
killed
menneville
i
had
that
misfortune
said
d
artagnan
bowing
like
a
man
who
is
being
congratulated
it
was
you
then
in
short
who
caused
the
two
condemned
persons
to
be
hung
instead
of
being
burnt
yes
monsieur
and
i
am
proud
of
it
i
saved
the
poor
devils
from
horrible
tortures
understand
my
dear
monsieur
de
gourville
that
they
wanted
to
burn
them
alive
it
exceeds
imagination
go
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
go
said
gourville
anxious
to
spare
fouquet
the
sight
of
the
man
who
had
just
caused
him
such
profound
grief
no
said
fouquet
who
had
heard
all
from
the
door
of
the
not
so
on
the
contrary
monsieur
d
artagnan
come
in
d
artagnan
wiped
from
the
hilt
of
his
sword
a
last
bloody
trace
which
had
escaped
his
notice
and
returned
he
then
found
himself
face
to
face
with
these
three
men
whose
countenances
wore
very
different
expressions
with
the
abbe
it
was
anger
with
gourville
stupor
with
fouquet
it
was
dejection
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
le
ministre
said
d
artagnan
but
my
time
is
short
i
have
to
go
to
the
office
of
the
intendant
to
have
an
explanation
with
monsieur
colbert
and
to
receive
my
quarter
s
pension
but
monsieur
said
fouquet
there
is
money
here
d
artagnan
looked
at
the
superintendent
with
astonishment
you
have
been
answered
inconsiderately
monsieur
i
know
because
i
heard
it
said
the
minister
a
man
of
your
merit
ought
to
be
known
by
everybody
d
artagnan
bowed
have
you
an
order
added
fouquet
yes
monsieur
give
it
me
i
will
pay
you
myself
come
with
me
he
made
a
sign
to
gourville
and
the
abbe
who
remained
in
the
chamber
where
they
were
he
led
d
artagnan
into
his
cabinet
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
how
much
is
due
to
you
monsieur
why
something
like
five
thousand
livres
monseigneur
for
arrears
of
pay
for
a
quarter
s
pay
a
quarter
consisting
of
five
thousand
livres
said
fouquet
fixing
upon
the
musketeer
a
searching
look
does
the
king
then
give
you
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
yes
monseigneur
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
do
you
think
it
is
too
much
i
cried
fouquet
and
he
smiled
bitterly
if
i
had
any
knowledge
of
mankind
if
i
were
instead
of
being
a
frivolous
inconsequent
and
vain
spirit
of
a
prudent
and
reflective
spirit
if
in
a
word
i
had
as
certain
persons
have
known
how
regulated
my
life
you
would
not
receive
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
but
a
hundred
thousand
and
you
would
belong
not
to
the
king
but
to
me
d
artagnan
colored
slightly
there
is
sometimes
in
the
manner
in
which
a
eulogium
is
given
in
the
voice
in
the
affectionate
tone
a
poison
so
sweet
that
the
strongest
mind
is
intoxicated
by
it
the
superintendent
terminated
his
speech
by
opening
a
drawer
and
taking
from
it
four
rouleaux
which
he
placed
before
d
artagnan
the
gascon
opened
one
gold
said
he
it
will
be
less
burdensome
monsieur
but
then
monsieur
these
make
twenty
thousand
livres
no
doubt
they
do
but
only
five
are
due
to
me
i
wish
to
spare
you
the
trouble
of
coming
four
times
to
my
office
you
overwhelm
me
monsieur
i
do
only
what
i
ought
to
do
monsieur
le
chevalier
and
i
hope
you
will
not
bear
me
any
malice
on
account
of
the
rude
reception
my
brother
gave
you
he
is
of
a
sour
capricious
disposition
monsieur
said
d
artagnan
believe
me
nothing
would
grieve
me
more
than
an
excuse
from
you
therefore
i
will
make
no
more
and
will
content
myself
with
asking
you
a
favor
oh
monsieur
fouquet
drew
from
his
finger
a
ring
worth
about
three
thousand
pistoles
monsieur
said
he
this
stone
was
given
me
by
a
friend
of
my
childhood
by
a
man
to
whom
you
have
rendered
a
great
service
a
service
i
said
the
musketeer
i
have
rendered
a
service
to
one
of
your
friends
you
can
not
have
forgotten
it
monsieur
for
it
dates
this
very
day
and
that
friend
s
name
was
m
d
eymeris
one
of
the
condemned
yes
one
of
the
victims
well
monsieur
d
artagnan
in
return
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
him
i
beg
you
to
accept
this
diamond
do
so
for
my
sake
monsieur
you
accept
it
i
say
is
with
me
a
day
of
mourning
hereafter
you
will
perhaps
learn
why
i
have
lost
one
friend
well
i
will
try
to
get
another
but
monsieur
fouquet
adieu
monsieur
d
artagnan
adieu
cried
fouquet
with
much
emotion
or
rather
au
revoir
and
the
minister
quitted
the
cabinet
leaving
in
the
hands
of
the
musketeer
the
ring
and
the
twenty
thousand
livres
oh
said
d
artagnan
after
a
moment
s
dark
reflection
how
on
earth
am
i
to
understand
what
this
means
mordioux
i
can
understand
this
much
only
he
is
a
gallant
man
i
will
go
and
explain
matters
to
m
colbert
and
he
went
out
chapter
lxiv
difference
d
artagnan
finds
between
the
intendant
and
the
superintendent
m
colbert
resided
in
the
rue
neuve
des
in
a
house
which
had
belonged
to
beautru
d
artagnan
s
legs
cleared
the
distance
in
a
short
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
arrived
at
the
residence
of
the
new
favorite
the
court
was
full
of
archers
and
police
who
came
to
congratulate
him
or
to
excuse
themselves
according
to
whether
he
should
choose
to
praise
or
blame
the
sentiment
of
flattery
is
instinctive
with
people
of
abject
condition
they
have
the
sense
of
it
as
the
wild
animal
has
that
of
hearing
and
smell
these
people
or
their
leader
understood
that
there
was
a
pleasure
to
offer
to
colbert
in
rendering
him
an
account
of
the
fashion
in
which
his
name
had
been
pronounced
during
the
rash
enterprise
of
the
morning
d
artagnan
made
his
appearance
just
as
the
chief
of
the
watch
was
giving
his
report
he
stood
close
to
the
door
behind
the
archers
that
officer
took
colbert
on
one
side
in
spite
of
his
resistance
and
the
contradiction
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
in
case
said
he
you
really
desired
monsieur
that
the
people
should
do
justice
on
the
two
traitors
it
would
have
been
wise
to
warn
us
of
it
for
indeed
monsieur
in
spite
of
our
regret
at
displeasing
you
or
thwarting
your
views
we
had
our
orders
to
execute
triple
fool
replied
colbert
furiously
shaking
his
hair
thick
and
black
as
a
mane
what
are
you
telling
me
what
that
i
could
have
had
an
idea
of
a
riot
are
you
mad
or
drunk
but
monsieur
they
cried
vive
colbert
replied
the
trembling
watch
a
handful
of
conspirators
no
no
a
mass
of
people
ah
indeed
said
colbert
expanding
a
mass
of
people
cried
vive
colbert
are
you
certain
of
what
you
say
monsieur
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
open
our
ears
or
rather
to
close
them
so
terrible
were
the
cries
and
this
was
from
the
people
the
real
people
certainly
monsieur
only
these
real
people
beat
us
oh
very
well
continued
colbert
thoughtfully
then
you
suppose
it
was
the
people
alone
who
wished
to
burn
the
condemned
oh
yes
monsieur
that
is
quite
another
thing
you
strongly
resisted
then
we
had
three
of
our
men
crushed
to
death
monsieur
but
you
killed
nobody
yourselves
monsieur
a
few
of
the
rioters
were
left
upon
the
square
and
one
among
them
who
was
not
a
common
man
who
was
he
a
certain
menneville
upon
whom
the
police
have
a
long
time
had
an
eye
menneville
cried
colbert
what
he
who
killed
rue
de
la
huchette
a
worthy
man
who
wanted
a
fat
fowl
yes
monsieur
the
same
and
did
this
menneville
also
cry
vive
colbert
louder
than
all
the
rest
like
a
madman
colbert
s
brow
grew
dark
and
wrinkled
a
kind
of
ambitious
glory
which
had
lighted
his
face
was
extinguished
like
the
light
of
we
crush
beneath
the
grass
then
you
say
resumed
the
deceived
intendant
that
the
initiative
came
from
the
people
menneville
was
my
enemy
i
would
have
had
him
hung
and
he
knew
it
well
menneville
belonged
to
the
abbe
fouquet
the
affair
originated
with
fouquet
does
not
everybody
know
that
the
condemned
were
his
friends
from
childhood
that
is
true
thought
d
artagnan
and
thus
are
all
my
doubts
cleared
up
i
repeat
it
monsieur
fouquet
may
be
called
what
they
please
but
he
is
a
very
gentlemanly
man
and
continued
colbert
are
you
quite
sure
menneville
is
dead
d
artagnan
thought
the
time
was
come
for
him
to
make
his
appearance
perfectly
monsieur
replied
he
advancing
suddenly
oh
is
that
you
monsieur
said
colbert
in
person
replied
the
musketeer
with
his
deliberate
tone
it
appears
that
you
had
in
menneville
a
pretty
enemy
it
was
not
i
monsieur
who
had
an
enemy
replied
colbert
it
was
the
king
double
brute
thought
d
artagnan
to
think
to
play
the
great
man
and
the
hypocrite
with
me
well
continued
he
to
colbert
i
am
very
happy
to
have
rendered
so
good
a
service
to
the
king
will
you
take
upon
you
to
tell
his
majesty
monsieur
l
intendant
what
commission
is
this
you
give
me
and
what
do
you
charge
me
to
tell
his
majesty
monsieur
be
precise
if
you
please
said
colbert
in
a
sharp
voice
tuned
beforehand
to
hostility
i
give
you
no
commission
replied
d
artagnan
with
that
calmness
which
never
abandons
the
banterer
i
thought
it
would
be
easy
for
you
to
announce
to
his
majesty
that
it
was
i
who
being
there
by
chance
did
justice
upon
menneville
and
restored
order
to
things
colbert
opened
his
eyes
and
interrogated
the
chief
of
the
watch
with
a
look
ah
it
is
very
true
said
the
latter
that
this
gentleman
saved
us
why
did
you
not
tell
me
monsieur
that
you
came
to
relate
me
this
said
colbert
with
envy
everything
is
explained
and
more
favorably
for
you
than
for
anybody
else
you
are
in
error
monsieur
l
intendant
i
did
not
at
all
come
for
the
purpose
of
relating
that
to
you
it
is
an
exploit
nevertheless
oh
said
the
musketeer
carelessly
constant
habit
blunts
the
mind
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honor
of
your
visit
then
simply
to
this
the
king
ordered
me
to
come
to
you
ah
said
colbert
recovering
himself
when
he
saw
d
artagnan
draw
a
paper
from
his
pocket
it
is
to
demand
some
money
of
me
precisely
monsieur
have
the
goodness
to
wait
if
you
please
monsieur
till
i
have
dispatched
the
report
of
the
watch
d
artagnan
turned
upon
his
heel
insolently
enough
and
finding
himself
face
to
face
with
colbert
after
his
first
turn
he
bowed
to
him
as
a
harlequin
would
have
done
then
after
a
second
evolution
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
door
in
quick
time
colbert
was
struck
with
this
pointed
rudeness
to
which
he
was
not
accustomed
in
general
men
of
the
sword
when
they
came
to
his
office
had
such
a
want
of
money
that
though
their
feet
seemed
to
take
root
in
the
marble
they
hardly
lost
their
patience
was
d
artagnan
going
straight
to
the
king
would
he
go
and
describe
his
rough
reception
or
recount
his
exploit
this
was
a
matter
for
grave
consideration
at
all
events
the
moment
was
badly
chosen
to
send
d
artagnan
away
whether
he
came
from
the
king
or
on
his
own
account
the
musketeer
had
rendered
too
great
a
service
and
that
too
recently
for
it
to
be
already
forgotten
therefore
colbert
thought
it
would
be
better
to
shake
off
his
arrogance
and
call
d
artagnan
back
ho
monsieur
d
artagnan
cried
colbert
what
are
you
leaving
me
thus
d
artagnan
turned
round
why
not
said
he
quietly
we
have
no
more
to
say
to
each
other
have
we
you
have
at
least
money
to
receive
as
you
have
an
order
who
i
oh
not
at
all
my
dear
monsieur
colbert
but
monsieur
you
have
an
order
and
in
the
same
manner
as
you
give
a
when
you
are
required
i
on
my
part
pay
when
an
order
is
presented
to
me
present
yours
it
is
useless
my
dear
monsieur
colbert
said
d
artagnan
who
inwardly
enjoyed
this
confusion
in
the
ideas
of
colbert
my
order
is
paid
paid
by
whom
by
monsieur
le
surintendant
colbert
grew
pale
explain
yourself
said
he
in
a
stifled
voice
if
you
are
paid
why
do
you
show
me
that
paper
in
consequence
of
the
word
of
order
of
which
you
spoke
to
me
so
ingeniously
just
now
dear
colbert
the
king
told
me
to
take
a
quarter
of
the
pension
he
is
pleased
to
make
me
of
me
said
colbert
not
exactly
the
king
said
to
me
go
to
fouquet
the
superintendent
will
perhaps
have
no
money
then
you
will
go
and
draw
it
of
the
countenance
of
colbert
brightened
for
a
moment
but
it
was
with
his
unfortunate
physiognomy
as
with
a
stormy
sky
sometimes
radiant
sometimes
dark
as
night
according
as
the
lightening
gleams
or
the
cloud
passes
eh
and
was
there
any
money
in
the
superintendent
s
coffers
asked
he
why
yes
he
could
not
be
badly
off
for
money
replied
d
artagnan
it
may
be
believed
since
fouquet
instead
of
paying
me
a
quarter
or
five
thousand
livres
a
quarter
or
five
thousand
livres
cried
colbert
struck
as
fouquet
had
been
with
the
generosity
of
the
sum
for
a
soldier
s
pension
why
that
would
be
a
pension
of
twenty
thousand
livres
exactly
colbert
peste
you
reckon
like
old
pythagoras
yes
twenty
thousand
livres
ten
times
the
appointment
of
an
intendant
of
the
finances
i
beg
to
offer
you
my
compliments
said
colbert
with
a
vicious
smile
oh
said
d
artagnan
the
king
apologized
for
giving
me
so
little
but
he
promised
to
make
it
more
hereafter
when
he
should
be
rich
but
i
must
be
gone
having
much
to
do
so
then
notwithstanding
the
expectation
of
the
king
the
superintendent
paid
you
did
he
in
the
same
manner
as
in
opposition
to
the
king
s
expectation
you
refused
to
pay
me
i
did
not
refuse
monsieur
i
only
begged
you
to
wait
and
you
say
that
fouquet
paid
you
your
five
thousand
livres
yes
as
you
might
have
done
but
he
did
even
better
than
that
m
colbert
and
what
did
he
do
he
politely
counted
me
down
the
saying
that
for
the
king
his
coffers
were
always
full
the
fouquet
has
given
you
twenty
thousand
livres
instead
of
five
thousand
yes
monsieur
and
what
for
in
order
to
spare
me
three
visits
to
the
of
the
superintendent
so
that
i
have
the
twenty
thousand
livres
in
my
pocket
in
good
new
coin
you
see
then
that
i
am
able
to
go
away
without
standing
in
need
of
you
having
come
here
only
for
form
s
sake
and
d
artagnan
slapped
his
hand
upon
his
pocket
with
a
laugh
which
disclosed
to
colbert
magnificent
teeth
as
white
as
teeth
of
years
old
and
which
seemed
to
say
in
their
language
serve
up
to
us
little
colberts
and
we
will
chew
them
willingly
the
serpent
is
as
brave
as
the
lion
the
hawk
as
courageous
as
the
eagle
that
can
not
be
contested
it
can
only
be
said
of
animals
that
are
decidedly
cowardly
and
are
so
called
that
they
will
be
brave
only
when
they
have
to
defend
themselves
colbert
was
not
frightened
at
the
teeth
of
d
artagnan
he
recovered
and
suddenly
monsieur
said
he
monsieur
le
surintendant
has
done
what
he
had
no
right
to
do
what
do
you
mean
by
that
replied
d
artagnan
i
mean
that
your
note
will
you
let
me
see
your
note
if
you
please
very
willingly
here
it
is
colbert
seized
the
paper
with
an
eagerness
which
the
musketeer
did
not
remark
without
uneasiness
and
particularly
without
a
certain
degree
of
regret
at
having
trusted
him
with
it
well
monsieur
the
royal
order
says
thus
at
sight
i
command
that
there
be
paid
to
d
artagnan
the
sum
of
five
thousand
livres
forming
a
quarter
of
the
pension
i
have
made
so
in
fact
it
is
written
said
d
artagnan
affecting
calmness
very
well
the
king
only
owed
you
five
thousand
livres
why
has
more
been
given
to
you
because
there
was
more
and
fouquet
was
willing
to
give
me
more
that
does
not
concern
anybody
it
is
natural
said
colbert
with
a
proud
ease
that
you
should
be
ignorant
of
the
usages
of
but
monsieur
when
you
have
a
thousand
livres
to
pay
what
do
you
do
i
never
have
a
thousand
livres
to
pay
replied
d
artagnan
once
more
said
colbert
irritated
once
more
if
you
had
any
sum
to
pay
would
you
not
pay
what
you
ought
that
only
proves
one
thing
said
d
artagnan
and
that
is
that
you
have
your
own
particular
customs
in
finance
and
fouquet
has
his
own
mine
monsieur
are
the
correct
ones
i
do
not
say
that
they
are
not
and
you
have
accepted
what
was
not
due
to
you
d
artagnan
s
eyes
flashed
what
is
not
due
to
me
yet
you
meant
to
say
colbert
for
if
i
have
received
what
was
not
due
to
me
at
all
i
should
have
committed
a
theft
colbert
made
no
reply
to
this
subtlety
you
then
owe
fifteen
thousand
livres
to
the
public
chest
said
he
carried
away
by
his
jealous
ardor
then
you
must
give
me
credit
for
them
replied
d
artagnan
with
his
imperceptible
irony
not
at
all
monsieur
well
what
will
you
do
then
you
will
not
take
my
rouleaux
from
me
will
you
you
must
return
them
to
my
chest
i
oh
monsieur
colbert
don
t
reckon
upon
that
the
king
wants
his
money
monsieur
and
i
monsieur
i
want
the
king
s
money
that
may
be
so
but
you
must
return
this
not
a
sou
i
have
always
understood
that
in
matters
of
comptabilite
as
you
call
it
a
good
cashier
never
gives
back
or
takes
back
then
monsieur
we
shall
see
what
the
king
will
say
about
it
i
will
show
him
this
note
which
proves
that
fouquet
not
only
pays
what
he
does
not
owe
but
that
he
does
not
even
take
care
of
vouchers
for
the
sums
that
he
has
paid
ah
now
i
understand
why
you
have
taken
that
paper
m
colbert
colbert
did
not
perceive
all
that
there
was
of
a
threatening
character
in
his
name
pronounced
in
a
certain
manner
you
shall
see
hereafter
what
use
i
will
make
of
it
said
he
holding
up
the
paper
in
his
fingers
oh
said
d
artagnan
snatching
the
paper
from
him
with
a
rapid
movement
i
understand
perfectly
well
colbert
i
have
no
occasion
to
wait
for
that
and
he
crumpled
up
the
paper
he
had
so
cleverly
seized
monsieur
monsieur
cried
colbert
this
is
violence
nonsense
you
must
not
be
particular
about
a
soldier
s
manners
replied
d
artagnan
i
kiss
your
hands
my
dear
m
colbert
and
he
went
out
laughing
in
the
face
of
the
future
minister
that
man
now
muttered
he
was
about
to
grow
quite
friendly
it
is
a
great
pity
i
was
obliged
to
cut
his
company
so
soon
chapter
lxv
philosophy
of
the
heart
and
mind
for
a
man
who
had
seen
so
many
much
more
dangerous
ones
the
position
of
d
artagnan
with
respect
to
colbert
was
only
comic
d
artagnan
therefore
did
not
deny
himself
the
satisfaction
of
laughing
at
the
expense
of
monsieur
l
intendant
from
the
rue
des
to
the
rue
des
lombards
it
was
a
great
while
since
d
artagnan
had
laughed
so
long
together
he
was
still
laughing
when
planchet
appeared
laughing
likewise
at
the
door
of
his
house
for
planchet
since
the
return
of
his
patron
since
the
entrance
of
the
english
guineas
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
doing
what
d
artagnan
had
only
done
from
the
rue
neuve
des
to
the
rue
des
lombards
you
are
home
then
my
dear
master
said
planchet
no
my
friend
replied
the
musketeer
i
am
off
and
that
quickly
i
will
sup
with
you
go
to
bed
sleep
five
hours
and
at
break
of
day
leap
into
my
saddle
has
my
horse
had
an
extra
feed
eh
my
dear
master
replied
planchet
you
know
very
well
that
your
horse
is
the
jewel
of
the
family
that
my
lads
are
caressing
it
all
day
and
cramming
it
with
sugar
nuts
and
biscuits
you
ask
me
if
he
has
had
an
extra
feed
of
oats
you
should
ask
if
he
has
not
had
enough
to
burst
him
very
well
planchet
that
is
all
right
now
then
i
pass
to
what
concerns
me
my
supper
ready
a
smoking
roast
joint
white
wine
crayfish
and
cherries
all
ready
my
master
you
are
a
capital
fellow
planchet
come
on
then
let
us
sup
and
i
will
go
to
bed
during
supper
d
artagnan
observed
that
planchet
kept
rubbing
his
forehead
as
if
to
facilitate
the
issue
of
some
idea
closely
pent
within
his
brain
he
looked
with
an
air
of
kindness
at
this
worthy
companion
of
former
adventures
and
misadventures
and
clinking
glass
against
glass
come
planchet
said
he
let
us
see
what
it
is
that
gives
you
so
much
trouble
to
bring
forth
mordioux
speak
freely
and
quickly
well
this
is
it
replied
planchet
you
appear
to
me
to
be
going
on
some
expedition
or
another
i
don
t
say
that
i
am
not
then
you
have
some
new
idea
that
is
possible
too
planchet
then
there
will
be
fresh
capital
to
be
ventured
i
will
lay
down
fifty
thousand
livres
upon
the
idea
you
are
about
to
carry
out
and
so
saying
planchet
rubbed
his
hands
one
against
the
other
with
a
rapidity
evincing
great
delight
planchet
said
d
artagnan
there
is
but
one
misfortune
in
it
and
what
is
that
that
the
idea
is
not
mine
i
can
risk
nothing
upon
it
these
words
drew
a
deep
sigh
from
the
heart
of
planchet
that
avarice
is
an
ardent
counselor
she
carries
away
her
man
as
satan
did
jesus
to
the
mountain
and
when
once
she
has
shown
to
an
unfortunate
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
she
is
able
to
repose
herself
knowing
full
well
that
she
has
left
her
companion
envy
to
gnaw
at
his
heart
planchet
had
tasted
of
riches
easily
acquired
and
was
never
afterwards
likely
to
stop
in
his
desires
but
as
he
had
a
good
heart
in
spite
of
his
covetousness
as
he
adored
d
artagnan
he
could
not
refrain
from
making
him
a
thousand
recommendations
each
more
affectionate
than
the
others
he
would
not
have
been
sorry
nevertheless
to
have
caught
a
little
hint
of
the
secret
his
master
concealed
so
well
tricks
turns
counsels
and
traps
were
all
useless
d
artagnan
let
nothing
confidential
escape
him
the
evening
passed
thus
after
supper
the
portmanteau
occupied
d
artagnan
he
took
a
turn
to
the
stable
patted
his
horse
and
examined
his
shoes
and
legs
then
having
counted
over
his
money
he
went
to
bed
sleeping
as
if
only
twenty
because
he
had
neither
inquietude
nor
remorse
he
closed
his
eyes
five
minutes
after
he
had
blown
out
his
lamp
many
events
might
however
have
kept
him
awake
thought
boiled
in
his
brain
conjectures
abounded
and
d
artagnan
was
a
great
drawer
of
horoscopes
but
with
that
imperturbable
phlegm
which
does
more
than
genius
for
the
fortune
and
happiness
of
men
of
action
he
put
off
reflection
till
the
next
day
for
fear
he
said
not
to
be
fresh
when
he
wanted
to
be
so
the
day
came
the
rue
des
lombards
had
its
share
of
the
caresses
of
aurora
with
the
rosy
fingers
and
d
artagnan
arose
like
aurora
he
did
not
awaken
anybody
he
placed
his
portmanteau
under
his
arm
descended
the
stairs
without
making
one
of
them
creak
and
without
disturbing
one
of
the
sonorous
snorings
in
every
story
from
the
garret
to
the
cellar
then
having
saddled
his
horse
shut
the
stable
and
house
doors
he
set
off
at
a
on
his
expedition
to
bretagne
he
had
done
quite
right
not
to
trouble
himself
with
all
the
political
and
diplomatic
affairs
which
solicited
his
attention
for
in
the
morning
in
freshness
and
mild
twilight
his
ideas
developed
themselves
in
purity
and
abundance
in
the
first
place
he
passed
before
the
house
of
fouquet
and
threw
in
a
large
gaping
box
the
fortunate
order
which
the
evening
before
he
had
had
so
much
trouble
to
recover
from
the
hooked
fingers
of
the
intendant
placed
in
an
envelope
and
addressed
to
fouquet
it
had
not
even
been
divined
by
planchet
who
in
divination
was
equal
to
calchas
or
the
pythian
apollo
d
artagnan
thus
sent
back
the
order
to
fouquet
without
compromising
himself
and
without
having
thenceforward
any
reproaches
to
make
himself
when
he
had
effected
this
proper
restitution
now
he
said
to
himself
let
us
inhale
much
maternal
air
much
freedom
from
cares
much
health
let
us
allow
the
horse
zephyr
whose
flanks
puff
as
if
he
had
to
respire
an
atmosphere
to
breathe
and
let
us
be
very
ingenious
in
our
little
calculations
it
is
time
said
d
artagnan
to
form
a
plan
of
the
campaign
and
according
to
the
method
of
turenne
who
has
a
large
head
full
of
all
sorts
of
good
counsels
before
the
plan
of
the
campaign
it
is
advisable
to
draw
a
striking
portrait
of
the
generals
to
whom
we
are
opposed
in
the
first
place
fouquet
presents
himself
what
is
fouquet
fouquet
replied
d
artagnan
to
himself
is
a
handsome
man
very
much
beloved
by
the
women
a
generous
man
very
much
beloved
by
the
poets
a
man
of
wit
much
execrated
by
pretenders
well
now
i
am
neither
woman
poet
nor
pretender
i
neither
love
not
hate
monsieur
le
surintendant
i
find
myself
therefore
in
the
same
position
in
which
turenne
found
himself
when
opposed
to
the
prince
de
conde
at
jargeau
gien
and
the
faubourg
he
did
not
execrate
monsieur
le
prince
it
is
true
but
he
obeyed
the
king
monsieur
le
prince
is
an
agreeable
man
but
the
king
is
king
turenne
heaved
a
deep
sigh
called
conde
my
cousin
and
swept
away
his
army
now
what
does
the
king
wish
that
does
not
concern
me
now
what
does
colbert
wish
oh
that
s
another
thing
colbert
wishes
all
that
fouquet
does
not
wish
then
what
does
fouquet
wish
oh
that
is
serious
fouquet
wishes
precisely
for
all
the
king
wishes
this
monologue
ended
d
artagnan
began
to
laugh
whilst
making
his
whip
whistle
in
the
air
he
was
already
on
the
high
road
frightening
the
birds
in
the
hedges
listening
to
the
livres
chinking
and
dancing
in
his
leather
pocket
at
every
step
and
let
us
confess
it
every
time
that
d
artagnan
found
himself
in
such
conditions
tenderness
was
not
his
dominant
vice
come
said
he
i
can
not
think
the
expedition
a
very
dangerous
one
and
it
will
fall
out
with
my
voyage
as
with
that
piece
monk
took
me
to
see
in
london
which
was
called
i
think
much
ado
about
chapter
lxvi
the
journey
it
was
perhaps
the
fiftieth
time
since
the
day
on
which
we
open
this
history
that
this
man
with
a
heart
of
bronze
and
muscles
of
steel
had
left
house
and
friends
everything
in
short
to
go
in
search
of
fortune
and
death
the
one
that
is
to
say
death
had
constantly
retreated
before
him
as
if
afraid
of
him
the
other
that
is
to
say
fortune
for
only
a
month
past
had
really
made
an
alliance
with
him
although
he
was
not
a
great
philosopher
after
the
fashion
of
either
epicurus
or
socrates
he
was
a
powerful
spirit
having
knowledge
of
life
and
endowed
with
thought
no
one
is
as
brave
as
adventurous
or
as
skillful
as
d
artagnan
without
at
the
same
time
being
inclined
to
be
a
dreamer
he
had
picked
up
here
and
there
some
scraps
of
de
la
rochefoucault
worthy
of
being
translated
into
latin
by
mm
de
port
royal
and
he
had
made
a
collection
en
passant
in
the
society
of
athos
and
aramis
of
many
morsels
of
seneca
and
cicero
translated
by
them
and
applied
to
the
uses
of
common
life
that
contempt
of
riches
which
our
gascon
had
observed
as
an
article
of
faith
during
the
first
years
of
his
life
had
for
a
long
time
been
considered
by
him
as
the
first
article
of
the
code
of
bravery
article
first
said
he
a
man
is
brave
because
he
has
nothing
a
man
has
nothing
because
he
despises
riches
therefore
with
these
principles
which
as
we
have
said
had
regulated
the
first
years
of
his
life
d
artagnan
was
no
sooner
possessed
of
riches
than
he
felt
it
necessary
to
ask
himself
if
in
spite
of
his
riches
he
were
still
brave
to
this
for
any
other
but
d
artagnan
the
events
of
the
place
de
greve
might
have
served
as
a
reply
many
consciences
would
have
been
satisfied
with
them
but
d
artagnan
was
brave
enough
to
ask
himself
sincerely
and
conscientiously
if
he
were
brave
therefore
to
this
but
it
appears
to
me
that
i
drew
promptly
enough
and
cut
and
thrust
pretty
freely
on
the
place
de
greve
to
be
satisfied
of
my
bravery
d
artagnan
had
himself
replied
gently
captain
that
is
not
an
answer
i
was
brave
that
day
because
they
were
burning
my
house
and
there
are
a
hundred
and
even
a
thousand
to
speak
against
one
that
if
those
gentlemen
of
the
riots
had
not
formed
that
unlucky
idea
their
plan
of
attack
would
have
succeeded
or
at
least
it
would
not
have
been
i
who
would
have
opposed
myself
to
it
now
what
will
be
brought
against
me
i
have
no
house
to
be
burnt
in
bretagne
i
have
no
treasure
there
that
can
be
taken
from
no
but
i
have
my
skin
that
precious
skin
of
d
artagnan
which
to
him
is
worth
more
than
all
the
houses
and
all
the
treasures
of
the
world
that
skin
to
which
i
cling
above
everything
because
it
is
everything
considered
the
binding
of
a
body
which
encloses
a
heart
very
warm
and
ready
to
fight
and
consequently
to
live
then
i
do
desire
to
live
and
in
reality
i
live
much
better
more
completely
since
i
have
become
rich
who
the
devil
ever
said
that
money
spoiled
life
upon
my
soul
it
is
no
such
thing
on
the
contrary
it
seems
as
if
i
absorbed
a
double
quantity
of
air
and
sun
mordioux
what
will
it
be
then
if
i
double
that
fortune
and
if
instead
of
the
switch
i
now
hold
in
my
hand
i
should
ever
carry
the
baton
of
a
marechal
then
i
really
don
t
know
if
there
will
be
from
that
moment
enough
of
air
and
sun
for
me
in
fact
this
is
not
a
dream
who
the
devil
would
oppose
it
if
the
king
made
me
a
marechal
as
his
father
king
louis
made
a
duke
and
constable
of
albert
de
luynes
am
i
not
as
brave
and
much
more
intelligent
than
that
imbecile
de
vitry
ah
that
s
exactly
what
will
prevent
my
advancement
i
have
too
much
wit
luckily
if
there
is
any
justice
in
this
world
fortune
owes
me
many
compensations
she
owes
me
certainly
a
recompense
for
all
i
did
for
anne
of
austria
and
an
indemnification
for
all
she
has
not
done
for
me
then
at
the
present
i
am
very
well
with
a
king
and
with
a
king
who
has
the
appearance
of
determining
to
reign
may
god
keep
him
in
that
illustrious
road
for
if
he
is
resolved
to
reign
he
will
want
me
and
if
he
wants
me
he
will
give
me
what
he
has
promised
me
warmth
and
light
so
that
i
march
comparatively
now
as
i
marched
formerly
from
nothing
to
everything
only
the
nothing
of
is
the
all
of
former
days
there
has
only
this
little
change
taken
place
in
my
life
and
now
let
us
see
let
us
take
the
part
of
the
heart
as
i
just
now
was
speaking
of
it
but
in
truth
i
only
spoke
of
it
from
memory
and
the
gascon
applied
his
hand
to
his
breast
as
if
he
were
actually
seeking
the
place
where
his
heart
was
ah
wretch
murmured
he
smiling
with
bitterness
ah
poor
mortal
species
you
hoped
for
an
instant
that
you
had
not
a
heart
and
now
you
find
you
have
one
bad
courtier
as
thou
art
and
even
one
of
the
most
seditious
you
have
a
heart
which
speaks
to
you
in
favor
of
fouquet
and
what
is
fouquet
when
the
king
is
in
question
a
conspirator
a
real
conspirator
who
did
not
even
give
himself
the
trouble
to
conceal
his
being
a
conspirator
therefore
what
a
weapon
would
you
not
have
against
him
if
his
good
grace
and
his
intelligence
had
not
made
a
scabbard
for
that
weapon
an
armed
revolt
for
in
fact
fouquet
has
been
guilty
of
an
armed
revolt
thus
while
the
king
vaguely
suspects
fouquet
of
rebellion
i
know
it
i
could
prove
that
fouquet
had
caused
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
his
majesty
s
subjects
now
then
let
us
see
knowing
all
that
and
holding
my
tongue
what
further
would
this
heart
wish
in
return
for
a
kind
action
of
fouquet
s
for
an
advance
of
fifteen
thousand
livres
for
a
diamond
worth
a
thousand
pistoles
for
a
smile
in
which
there
was
as
much
bitterness
as
kindness
i
save
his
life
now
then
i
hope
continued
the
musketeer
that
this
imbecile
of
a
heart
is
going
to
preserve
silence
and
so
be
fairly
quits
with
fouquet
now
then
the
king
becomes
my
sun
and
as
my
heart
is
quits
with
fouquet
let
him
beware
who
places
himself
between
me
and
my
sun
forward
for
his
majesty
louis
forward
these
reflections
were
the
only
impediments
which
were
able
to
retard
the
progress
of
d
artagnan
these
reflections
once
made
he
increased
the
speed
of
his
horse
but
however
perfect
his
horse
zephyr
might
be
it
could
not
hold
out
at
such
a
pace
forever
the
day
after
his
departure
from
paris
his
mount
was
left
at
chartres
at
the
house
of
an
old
friend
d
artagnan
had
met
with
in
an
hotelier
of
that
city
from
that
moment
the
musketeer
travelled
on
thanks
to
this
mode
of
locomotion
he
traversed
the
space
separating
chartres
from
chateaubriand
in
the
last
of
these
two
cities
far
enough
from
the
coast
to
prevent
any
one
guessing
that
d
artagnan
wished
to
reach
the
sea
far
enough
from
paris
to
prevent
all
suspicion
of
his
being
a
messenger
from
louis
whom
d
artagnan
had
called
his
sun
without
suspecting
that
he
who
was
only
at
present
a
rather
poor
star
in
the
heaven
of
royalty
would
one
day
make
that
star
his
emblem
the
messenger
of
louis
we
say
quitted
his
post
and
purchased
a
bidet
of
the
meanest
appearance
one
of
those
animals
which
an
officer
of
the
cavalry
would
never
choose
for
fear
of
being
disgraced
excepting
the
color
this
new
acquisition
recalled
to
the
mind
of
d
artagnan
the
famous
horse
with
which
or
rather
upon
which
he
had
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
world
truth
to
say
from
the
moment
he
crossed
this
new
steed
it
was
no
longer
d
artagnan
who
was
travelling
it
was
a
good
man
clothed
in
an
justaucorps
brown
holding
the
medium
between
a
priest
and
a
layman
that
which
brought
him
nearest
to
the
churchman
was
that
d
artagnan
had
placed
on
his
head
a
calotte
of
threadbare
velvet
and
over
the
calotte
a
large
black
hat
no
more
sword
a
stick
hung
by
a
cord
to
his
wrist
but
to
which
he
promised
himself
as
an
unexpected
auxiliary
to
join
upon
occasion
a
good
dagger
ten
inches
long
concealed
under
his
cloak
the
bidet
purchased
at
chateaubriand
completed
the
metamorphosis
it
was
called
or
rather
d
artagnan
called
if
furet
ferret
if
i
have
changed
zephyr
into
furet
said
d
artagnan
i
must
make
some
diminutive
or
other
of
my
own
name
so
instead
of
d
artagnan
i
will
be
agnan
short
that
is
a
concession
which
i
naturally
owe
to
my
gray
coat
my
round
hat
and
my
rusty
calotte
monsieur
d
artagnan
traveled
then
pretty
easily
upon
furet
who
ambled
like
a
true
s
pad
and
who
with
his
amble
managed
cheerfully
about
twelve
leagues
a
day
upon
four
of
which
the
practiced
eye
of
d
artagnan
had
appreciated
the
strength
and
safety
beneath
the
thick
mass
of
hair
which
covered
them
jogging
along
the
traveler
took
notes
studied
the
country
which
he
traversed
reserved
and
silent
ever
seeking
the
most
plausible
pretext
for
reaching
and
for
seeing
everything
without
arousing
suspicion
in
this
manner
he
was
enabled
to
convince
himself
of
the
importance
the
event
assumed
in
proportion
as
he
drew
near
to
it
in
this
remote
country
in
this
ancient
duchy
of
bretagne
which
was
not
france
at
that
period
and
is
not
so
even
now
the
people
knew
nothing
of
the
king
of
france
they
not
only
did
not
know
him
but
were
unwilling
to
know
him
one
face
a
single
one
floated
visibly
for
them
upon
the
political
current
their
ancient
dukes
no
longer
ruled
them
government
was
a
void
nothing
more
in
place
of
the
sovereign
duke
the
seigneurs
of
parishes
reigned
without
control
and
above
these
seigneurs
god
who
has
never
been
forgotten
in
bretagne
among
these
suzerains
of
chateaux
and
belfries
the
most
powerful
the
richest
the
most
popular
was
fouquet
seigneur
of
even
in
the
country
even
within
sight
of
that
mysterious
isle
legends
and
traditions
consecrate
its
wonders
every
one
might
not
penetrate
it
the
isle
of
an
extent
of
six
leagues
in
length
and
six
in
breadth
was
a
seignorial
property
which
the
people
had
for
a
long
time
respected
covered
as
it
was
with
the
name
of
retz
so
redoubtable
in
the
country
shortly
after
the
erection
of
this
seignory
into
a
marquistate
passed
to
fouquet
the
celebrity
of
the
isle
did
not
date
from
yesterday
its
name
or
rather
its
qualification
is
traced
back
to
the
remotest
antiquity
the
ancients
called
it
kalonese
from
two
greek
words
signifying
beautiful
isle
thus
at
a
distance
of
eighteen
hundred
years
it
had
borne
in
another
idiom
the
same
name
it
still
bears
there
was
then
something
in
itself
in
this
property
of
fouquet
s
besides
its
position
of
six
leagues
off
the
coast
of
france
a
position
which
makes
it
a
sovereign
in
its
maritime
solitude
like
a
majestic
ship
which
disdains
roads
and
proudly
casts
anchor
in
d
artagnan
learnt
all
this
without
appearing
the
least
in
the
world
astonished
he
also
learnt
the
best
way
to
get
intelligence
was
to
go
to
la
a
tolerably
important
city
at
the
mouth
of
the
vilaine
perhaps
there
he
could
embark
if
not
crossing
the
salt
marshes
he
would
repair
to
guerande
or
le
croisic
to
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
cross
over
to
he
had
discovered
besides
since
his
departure
from
chateaubriand
that
nothing
would
be
impossible
for
furet
under
the
impulsion
of
agnan
and
nothing
to
agnan
through
the
initiative
of
furet
he
prepared
then
to
sup
off
a
teal
and
a
torteau
in
a
hotel
of
la
and
ordered
to
be
brought
from
the
cellar
to
wash
down
these
two
breton
dishes
some
cider
which
the
moment
it
touched
his
lips
he
perceived
to
be
more
breton
still
chapter
lxvii
how
d
artagnan
became
acquainted
with
a
poet
before
taking
his
place
at
table
d
artagnan
acquired
as
was
his
custom
all
the
information
he
could
but
it
is
an
axiom
of
curiosity
that
every
man
who
wishes
to
question
well
and
fruitfully
ought
in
the
first
place
to
lay
himself
open
to
questions
d
artagnan
sought
then
with
his
usual
skill
a
promising
questioner
in
the
hostelry
of
la
at
the
moment
there
were
in
the
house
on
the
first
story
two
travelers
either
preparing
for
supper
or
at
supper
itself
d
artagnan
had
seen
their
nags
in
the
stable
and
their
equipages
in
the
salle
one
traveled
with
a
lackey
undoubtedly
a
person
of
consideration
two
perche
mares
sleek
sound
beasts
were
suitable
means
of
locomotion
the
other
a
little
fellow
a
traveler
of
meagre
appearance
wearing
a
dusty
surtout
dirty
linen
and
boots
more
worn
by
the
pavement
than
the
stirrup
had
come
from
nantes
with
a
cart
drawn
by
a
horse
so
like
furet
in
color
that
d
artagnan
might
have
gone
a
hundred
miles
without
finding
a
better
match
this
cart
contained
divers
large
packets
wrapped
in
pieces
of
old
stuff
that
traveler
yonder
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
is
the
man
for
my
money
he
will
do
he
suits
me
i
ought
to
do
for
him
and
suit
him
agnan
with
the
gray
doublet
and
the
rusty
calotte
is
not
unworthy
of
supping
with
the
gentleman
of
the
old
boots
and
still
older
horse
this
said
d
artagnan
called
the
host
and
desired
him
to
send
his
teal
tourteau
and
cider
up
to
the
chamber
of
the
gentleman
of
modest
exterior
he
himself
climbed
a
plate
in
his
hand
the
wooden
staircase
which
led
to
the
chamber
and
began
to
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
the
unknown
d
artagnan
entered
with
a
simper
on
his
lips
his
plate
under
his
arm
his
hat
in
one
hand
his
candle
in
the
other
excuse
me
monsieur
said
he
i
am
as
you
are
a
traveler
i
know
no
one
in
the
hotel
and
i
have
the
bad
habit
of
losing
my
spirits
when
i
eat
alone
so
that
my
repast
appears
a
bad
one
to
me
and
does
not
nourish
me
your
face
which
i
saw
just
now
when
you
came
down
to
have
some
oysters
opened
your
face
pleased
me
much
besides
i
have
observed
you
have
a
horse
just
like
mine
and
that
the
host
no
doubt
on
account
of
that
resemblance
has
placed
them
side
by
side
in
the
stable
where
they
appear
to
agree
amazingly
well
together
i
therefore
monsieur
do
not
see
any
reason
why
the
masters
should
be
separated
when
the
horses
are
united
accordingly
i
am
come
to
request
the
pleasure
of
being
admitted
to
your
table
my
name
is
agnan
at
your
service
monsieur
the
unworthy
steward
of
a
rich
seigneur
who
wishes
to
purchase
some
in
this
country
and
sends
me
to
examine
his
future
acquisitions
in
truth
monsieur
i
should
be
well
pleased
if
my
countenance
were
as
agreeable
to
you
as
yours
is
to
me
for
upon
my
honor
i
am
quite
at
your
service
the
stranger
whom
d
artagnan
saw
for
the
first
time
for
before
he
had
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
the
stranger
had
black
and
brilliant
eyes
a
yellow
complexion
a
brow
a
little
wrinkled
by
the
weight
of
fifty
years
bonhomie
in
his
features
collectively
but
some
cunning
in
his
look
one
would
say
thought
d
artagnan
that
this
merry
fellow
has
never
exercised
more
than
the
upper
part
of
his
head
his
eyes
and
his
brain
he
must
be
a
man
of
science
his
mouth
nose
and
chin
signify
absolutely
nothing
monsieur
replied
the
latter
with
whose
mind
and
person
we
have
been
making
so
free
you
do
me
much
honor
not
that
i
am
ever
ennuye
for
i
have
added
he
smiling
a
company
which
amuses
me
always
but
never
mind
that
i
am
happy
to
receive
you
but
when
saying
this
the
man
with
the
worn
boots
cast
an
uneasy
look
at
his
table
from
which
the
oysters
had
disappeared
and
upon
which
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
morsel
of
salt
bacon
monsieur
d
artagnan
hastened
to
say
the
host
is
bringing
me
up
a
pretty
piece
of
roasted
poultry
and
a
superb
tourteau
d
artagnan
had
read
in
the
look
of
his
companion
however
rapidly
it
disappeared
the
fear
of
an
attack
by
a
parasite
he
divined
justly
at
this
opening
the
features
of
the
man
of
modest
exterior
relaxed
and
as
if
he
had
watched
the
moment
for
his
entrance
as
d
artagnan
spoke
the
host
appeared
bearing
the
announced
dishes
the
tourteau
and
the
teal
were
added
to
the
morsel
of
broiled
bacon
d
artagnan
and
his
guest
bowed
sat
down
opposite
to
each
other
and
like
two
brothers
shared
the
bacon
and
the
other
dishes
monsieur
said
d
artagnan
you
must
confess
that
association
is
a
wonderful
thing
how
so
replied
the
stranger
with
his
mouth
full
well
i
will
tell
you
replied
d
artagnan
the
stranger
gave
a
short
truce
to
the
movement
of
his
jaws
in
order
to
hear
the
better
in
the
first
place
continued
d
artagnan
instead
of
one
candle
which
each
of
us
had
we
have
two
that
is
true
said
the
stranger
struck
with
the
extreme
lucidity
of
the
observation
then
i
see
that
you
eat
my
tourteau
in
preference
whilst
i
in
preference
eat
your
bacon
that
is
true
again
and
then
in
addition
to
being
better
lighted
and
eating
what
we
prefer
i
place
the
pleasure
of
your
company
truly
monsieur
you
are
very
jovial
said
the
unknown
cheerfully
yes
monsieur
jovial
as
all
people
are
who
carry
nothing
on
their
minds
or
for
that
matter
in
their
heads
oh
i
can
see
it
is
quite
another
sort
of
thing
with
you
continued
d
artagnan
i
can
read
in
your
eyes
all
sorts
of
genius
oh
monsieur
come
confess
one
thing
what
is
that
that
you
are
a
learned
man
ma
foi
monsieur
hein
almost
come
then
i
am
an
author
there
cried
d
artagnan
clapping
his
hands
i
knew
i
could
not
be
deceived
it
is
a
miracle
monsieur
what
shall
i
have
the
honor
of
passing
the
evening
in
the
society
of
an
author
of
a
celebrated
author
perhaps
oh
said
the
unknown
blushing
celebrated
monsieur
celebrated
is
not
the
word
modest
cried
d
artagnan
transported
he
is
modest
then
turning
towards
the
stranger
with
a
character
of
blunt
bonhomie
but
tell
me
at
least
the
name
of
your
works
monsieur
for
you
will
please
to
observe
you
have
not
told
me
your
name
and
i
have
been
forced
to
divine
your
genius
my
name
is
jupenet
monsieur
said
the
author
a
fine
name
a
grand
name
upon
my
honor
and
i
do
not
know
why
pardon
me
the
mistake
if
it
be
one
but
surely
i
have
heard
that
name
somewhere
i
have
made
verses
said
the
poet
modestly
ah
that
is
it
then
i
have
heard
them
read
a
tragedy
i
must
have
seen
it
played
the
poet
blushed
again
and
said
i
do
not
think
that
can
be
the
case
for
my
verses
have
never
been
printed
well
then
it
must
have
been
the
tragedy
which
informed
me
of
your
name
you
are
again
mistaken
for
mm
the
comedians
of
the
hotel
de
bourgogne
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
the
poet
with
a
smile
the
receipt
for
which
certain
sorts
of
pride
alone
knew
the
secret
d
artagnan
bit
his
lips
thus
then
you
see
monsieur
continued
the
poet
you
are
in
error
on
my
account
and
that
not
being
at
all
known
to
you
you
have
never
heard
tell
of
me
ah
that
confounds
me
that
name
jupenet
appears
to
me
nevertheless
a
fine
name
and
quite
as
worthy
of
being
known
as
those
of
mm
corneille
or
rotrou
or
garnier
i
hope
monsieur
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
repeat
to
me
a
part
of
your
tragedy
presently
by
way
of
dessert
for
instance
that
will
be
sugared
roast
meat
mordioux
ah
pardon
me
monsieur
that
was
a
little
oath
which
escaped
me
because
it
is
a
habit
with
my
lord
and
master
i
sometimes
allow
myself
to
usurp
that
little
oath
as
it
seems
in
pretty
good
taste
i
take
this
liberty
only
in
his
absence
please
to
observe
for
you
may
understand
that
in
his
presence
but
in
truth
monsieur
this
cider
is
abominable
do
you
not
think
so
and
besides
the
pot
is
of
such
an
irregular
shape
it
will
not
stand
on
the
table
suppose
we
were
to
make
it
level
to
be
sure
but
with
what
with
this
knife
and
the
teal
with
what
shall
we
cut
that
up
do
you
not
by
chance
mean
to
touch
the
teal
certainly
well
then
wait
and
the
poet
rummaged
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
piece
of
brass
oblong
quadrangular
about
a
line
in
thickness
and
an
inch
and
a
half
in
length
but
scarcely
had
this
little
piece
of
brass
seen
the
light
than
the
poet
appeared
to
have
committed
an
imprudence
and
made
a
movement
to
put
it
back
again
in
his
pocket
d
artagnan
perceived
this
for
he
was
a
man
that
nothing
escaped
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
towards
the
piece
of
brass
humph
that
which
you
hold
in
your
hand
is
pretty
will
you
allow
me
to
look
at
it
certainly
said
the
poet
who
appeared
to
have
yielded
too
soon
to
a
first
impulse
certainly
you
may
look
at
it
but
it
will
be
in
vain
for
you
to
look
at
it
added
he
with
a
satisfied
air
if
i
were
not
to
tell
you
its
use
you
would
never
guess
it
d
artagnan
had
seized
as
an
avowal
the
hesitation
of
the
poet
and
his
eagerness
to
conceal
the
piece
of
brass
which
a
first
movement
had
induced
him
to
take
out
of
his
pocket
his
attention
therefore
once
awakened
on
this
point
he
surrounded
himself
with
a
circumspection
which
gave
him
a
superiority
on
all
occasions
besides
whatever
jupenet
might
say
about
it
by
a
simple
inspection
of
the
object
he
perfectly
well
knew
what
it
was
it
was
a
character
in
printing
can
you
guess
now
what
this
is
continued
the
poet
no
said
d
artagnan
no
ma
foi
well
monsieur
said
jupenet
this
little
piece
of
metal
is
a
printing
letter
bah
a
capital
stop
stop
stop
said
d
artagnan
opening
his
eyes
very
innocently
yes
monsieur
a
capital
the
first
letter
of
my
name
and
this
is
a
letter
is
it
yes
monsieur
well
i
will
confess
one
thing
to
you
and
what
is
that
no
i
will
not
i
was
going
to
say
something
stupid
no
no
said
master
jupenet
with
a
patronizing
air
well
then
i
can
not
comprehend
if
that
is
a
letter
how
you
can
make
a
word
a
word
yes
a
printed
word
oh
that
s
very
easy
let
me
see
does
it
interest
you
enormously
well
i
will
explain
the
thing
to
you
attend
i
am
attending
this
is
it
good
look
attentively
i
am
looking
d
artagnan
in
fact
appeared
absorbed
in
observations
jupenet
drew
from
his
pocket
seven
or
eight
other
pieces
of
brass
smaller
than
the
first
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
what
you
have
then
a
whole
in
your
pocket
peste
that
is
curious
indeed
is
it
not
good
god
what
a
number
of
things
we
learn
by
traveling
to
your
health
said
jupenet
quite
enchanted
to
yours
mordioux
to
yours
but
an
instant
not
in
this
cider
it
is
an
abominable
drink
unworthy
of
a
man
who
quenches
his
thirst
at
the
hippocrene
fountain
is
not
it
so
you
call
your
fountain
you
poets
yes
monsieur
our
fountain
is
so
called
that
comes
from
two
greek
words
hippos
which
means
a
horse
and
monsieur
interrupted
d
artagnan
you
shall
drink
of
a
liquor
which
comes
from
one
single
french
word
and
is
none
the
worse
for
that
from
the
word
grape
this
cider
gives
me
the
heartburn
allow
me
to
inquire
of
your
host
if
there
is
not
a
good
bottle
of
beaugency
or
of
the
ceran
growth
at
the
back
of
the
large
bins
in
his
cellar
the
host
being
sent
for
immediately
attended
monsieur
interrupted
the
poet
take
care
we
shall
not
have
time
to
drink
the
wine
unless
we
make
great
haste
for
i
must
take
advantage
of
the
tide
to
secure
the
boat
what
boat
asked
d
artagnan
why
the
boat
which
sets
out
for
ah
for
said
the
musketeer
that
is
good
bah
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
monsieur
replied
the
hotelier
uncorking
the
bottle
the
boat
will
not
leave
this
hour
but
who
will
give
me
notice
said
the
poet
your
replied
the
host
but
i
scarcely
know
him
when
you
hear
him
departing
it
will
be
time
for
you
to
go
is
he
going
to
likewise
then
yes
the
traveler
who
has
a
lackey
asked
d
artagnan
he
is
some
gentleman
no
doubt
i
know
nothing
of
him
what
know
nothing
of
him
no
all
i
know
is
that
he
is
drinking
the
same
wine
as
you
peste
that
is
a
great
honor
for
us
said
d
artagnan
filling
his
companion
s
glass
whilst
the
host
went
out
so
resumed
the
poet
returning
to
his
dominant
ideas
you
never
saw
any
printing
done
never
well
then
take
the
letters
thus
which
compose
the
word
you
see
a
b
ma
foi
here
is
an
r
two
e
e
then
a
and
he
assembled
the
letters
with
a
swiftness
and
skill
which
did
not
escape
the
eye
of
d
artagnan
abrege
said
he
as
he
ended
good
said
d
artagnan
here
are
plenty
of
letters
got
together
but
how
are
they
kept
so
and
he
poured
out
a
second
glass
for
the
poet
jupenet
smiled
like
a
man
who
has
an
answer
for
everything
then
he
pulled
out
still
from
his
pocket
a
little
metal
ruler
composed
of
two
parts
like
a
carpenter
s
rule
against
which
he
put
together
and
in
a
line
the
characters
holding
them
under
his
left
thumb
and
what
do
you
call
that
little
metal
ruler
said
d
artagnan
for
i
suppose
all
these
things
have
names
this
is
called
a
said
jupenet
it
is
by
the
aid
of
this
stick
that
the
lines
are
formed
come
then
i
was
not
mistaken
in
what
i
said
you
have
a
press
in
your
pocket
said
d
artagnan
laughing
with
an
air
of
simplicity
so
stupid
that
the
poet
was
completely
his
dupe
no
replied
he
but
i
am
too
lazy
to
write
and
when
i
have
a
verse
in
my
head
i
print
it
immediately
that
is
a
labor
spared
mordioux
thought
d
artagnan
to
himself
this
must
be
cleared
up
and
under
a
pretext
which
did
not
embarrass
the
musketeer
who
was
fertile
in
expedients
he
left
the
table
went
downstairs
ran
to
the
shed
under
which
stood
the
poet
s
little
cart
and
poked
the
point
of
his
poniard
into
the
stuff
which
enveloped
one
of
the
packages
which
he
found
full
of
types
like
those
which
the
poet
had
in
his
pocket
humph
said
d
artagnan
i
do
not
yet
know
whether
fouquet
wishes
to
fortify
but
at
all
events
here
are
some
spiritual
munitions
for
the
castle
then
enchanted
with
his
rich
discovery
he
ran
upstairs
again
and
resumed
his
place
at
the
table
d
artagnan
had
learnt
what
he
wished
to
know
he
however
remained
none
the
less
face
to
face
with
his
partner
to
the
moment
when
they
heard
from
the
next
room
symptoms
of
a
person
s
being
about
to
go
out
the
printer
was
immediately
on
foot
he
had
given
orders
for
his
horse
to
be
got
ready
his
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
the
second
traveler
got
into
his
saddle
in
the
courtyard
with
his
lackey
d
artagnan
followed
jupenet
to
the
door
he
embarked
his
cart
and
horse
on
board
the
boat
as
to
the
opulent
traveler
he
did
the
same
with
his
two
horses
and
servant
but
all
the
wit
d
artagnan
employed
in
endeavoring
to
find
out
his
name
was
lost
he
could
learn
nothing
only
he
took
such
notice
of
his
countenance
that
it
was
impressed
upon
his
mind
forever
d
artagnan
had
a
great
inclination
to
embark
with
the
two
travelers
but
an
interest
more
powerful
than
curiosity
that
of
success
repelled
him
from
the
shore
and
brought
him
back
again
to
the
hostelry
he
entered
with
a
sigh
and
went
to
bed
directly
in
order
to
be
ready
early
in
the
morning
with
fresh
ideas
and
the
sage
counsel
of
sufficing
sleep
chapter
lxviii
d
artagnan
continues
his
investigations
at
daybreak
d
artagnan
saddled
furet
who
had
fared
sumptuously
all
night
devouring
the
remainder
of
the
oats
and
hay
left
by
his
companions
the
musketeer
sifted
all
he
possibly
could
out
of
the
host
who
he
found
cunning
mistrustful
and
devoted
body
and
soul
to
fouquet
in
order
not
to
awaken
the
suspicions
of
this
man
he
carried
on
his
fable
of
being
a
probable
purchaser
of
some
to
have
embarked
for
at
would
have
been
to
expose
himself
still
further
to
comments
which
had
perhaps
been
already
made
and
would
be
carried
to
the
castle
moreover
it
was
singular
that
this
traveler
and
his
lackey
should
have
remained
a
mystery
to
d
artagnan
in
spite
of
all
the
questions
addressed
by
him
to
the
host
who
appeared
to
know
him
perfectly
well
the
musketeer
then
made
some
inquiries
concerning
the
and
took
the
road
to
the
marshes
leaving
the
sea
on
his
right
and
penetrating
into
that
vast
and
desolate
plain
which
resembles
a
sea
of
mud
of
which
here
and
there
a
few
crests
of
salt
silver
the
undulations
furet
walked
admirably
with
his
little
nervous
legs
along
the
causeways
which
separate
the
d
artagnan
aware
of
the
consequences
of
a
fall
which
would
result
in
a
cold
bath
allowed
him
to
go
as
he
liked
contenting
himself
with
looking
at
on
the
horizon
three
rocks
that
rose
up
like
from
the
bosom
of
the
plain
destitute
of
verdure
piriac
the
bourgs
of
batz
and
le
croisic
exactly
resembling
each
other
attracted
and
suspended
his
attention
if
the
traveler
turned
round
the
better
to
make
his
observations
he
saw
on
the
other
side
an
horizon
of
three
other
steeples
guerande
le
pouliguen
and
which
in
their
circumference
represented
a
set
of
skittles
of
which
he
and
furet
were
but
the
wandering
ball
piriac
was
the
first
little
port
on
his
right
he
went
thither
with
the
names
of
the
principal
salters
on
his
lips
at
the
moment
he
reached
the
little
port
of
piriac
five
large
barges
laden
with
stone
were
leaving
it
it
appeared
strange
to
d
artagnan
that
stones
should
be
leaving
a
country
where
none
are
found
he
had
recourse
to
all
the
amenity
of
agnan
to
learn
from
the
people
of
the
port
the
cause
of
this
singular
arrangement
an
old
fisherman
replied
to
agnan
that
the
stones
very
certainly
did
not
come
from
piriac
or
the
marshes
where
do
they
come
from
then
asked
the
musketeer
monsieur
they
come
from
nantes
and
paimboeuf
where
are
they
going
then
monsieur
to
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
in
the
same
tone
he
had
assumed
to
tell
the
printer
that
his
character
interested
him
are
they
building
at
then
why
yes
monsieur
fouquet
has
the
walls
of
the
castle
repaired
every
year
it
is
in
ruins
then
it
is
old
thank
you
the
fact
is
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
nothing
is
more
natural
every
proprietor
has
a
right
to
repair
his
own
property
it
would
be
like
telling
me
i
was
fortifying
the
when
i
was
simply
obliged
to
make
repairs
in
good
truth
i
believe
false
reports
have
been
made
to
his
majesty
and
he
is
very
likely
to
be
in
the
wrong
you
must
confess
continued
he
then
aloud
and
addressing
the
fisherman
for
his
part
of
a
suspicious
man
was
imposed
upon
him
by
the
object
even
of
his
mission
you
must
confess
my
dear
monsieur
that
these
stones
travel
in
a
very
curious
fashion
how
so
said
the
fisherman
they
come
from
nantes
or
paimboeuf
by
the
loire
do
they
not
with
the
tide
that
is
convenient
i
don
t
say
it
is
not
but
why
do
they
not
go
straight
from
to
eh
because
the
chalands
barges
are
boats
and
take
the
sea
badly
replied
the
fisherman
that
is
not
sufficient
reason
pardon
me
monsieur
one
may
see
that
you
have
never
been
a
sailor
added
the
fisherman
not
without
a
sort
of
disdain
explain
to
me
if
you
please
my
good
man
it
appears
to
me
that
to
come
from
paimboeuf
to
piriac
and
go
from
piriac
to
is
as
if
we
went
from
to
nantes
and
from
nantes
to
piriac
by
water
that
would
be
the
nearest
way
replied
the
fisherman
imperturbably
but
there
is
an
elbow
the
fisherman
shook
his
head
the
shortest
road
from
one
place
to
another
is
a
straight
line
continued
d
artagnan
you
forget
the
tide
monsieur
well
take
the
tide
and
the
wind
well
and
the
wind
without
doubt
the
current
of
the
loire
carries
barks
almost
as
far
as
croisic
if
they
want
to
lie
by
a
little
or
to
refresh
the
crew
they
come
to
piriac
along
the
coast
from
piriac
they
find
another
inverse
current
which
carries
them
to
the
two
leagues
and
a
half
granted
there
the
current
of
the
vilaine
throws
them
upon
another
isle
the
isle
of
hoedic
i
agree
with
that
well
monsieur
from
that
isle
to
the
way
is
quite
straight
the
sea
broken
both
above
and
below
passes
like
a
canal
like
a
mirror
between
the
two
isles
the
chalands
glide
along
upon
it
like
ducks
upon
the
loire
that
s
how
it
is
it
does
not
signify
said
the
obstinate
agnan
it
is
a
long
way
round
ah
yes
but
fouquet
will
have
it
so
replied
as
conclusive
the
fisherman
taking
off
his
woolen
cap
at
the
enunciation
of
that
respected
name
a
look
from
d
artagnan
a
look
as
keen
and
piercing
as
a
found
nothing
in
the
heart
of
the
old
man
but
a
simple
confidence
on
his
features
nothing
but
satisfaction
and
indifference
he
said
fouquet
will
have
it
so
as
he
would
have
said
god
has
willed
it
d
artagnan
had
already
advanced
too
far
in
this
direction
besides
the
chalands
being
gone
there
remained
nothing
at
piriac
but
a
single
bark
that
of
the
old
man
and
it
did
not
look
fit
for
sea
without
great
preparation
d
artagnan
therefore
patted
furet
who
as
a
new
proof
of
his
charming
character
resumed
his
march
with
his
feet
in
the
and
his
nose
to
the
dry
wind
which
bends
the
furze
and
the
broom
of
this
country
they
reached
le
croisic
about
five
o
clock
if
d
artagnan
had
been
a
poet
it
was
a
beautiful
spectacle
the
immense
strand
of
a
league
or
more
the
sea
covers
at
high
tide
and
which
at
the
reflux
appears
gray
and
desolate
strewed
with
polypi
and
seaweed
with
pebbles
sparse
and
white
like
bones
in
some
vast
old
cemetery
but
the
soldier
the
politician
and
the
ambitious
man
had
no
longer
the
sweet
consolation
of
looking
towards
heaven
to
read
there
a
hope
or
a
warning
a
red
sky
signifies
nothing
to
such
people
but
wind
and
disturbance
white
and
fleecy
clouds
upon
the
azure
only
say
that
the
sea
will
be
smooth
and
peaceful
d
artagnan
found
the
sky
blue
the
breeze
embalmed
with
saline
perfumes
and
he
said
i
will
embark
with
the
first
tide
if
it
be
but
in
a
nutshell
at
le
croisic
as
at
piriac
he
had
remarked
enormous
heaps
of
stone
lying
along
the
shore
these
gigantic
walls
diminished
every
tide
by
the
barges
for
were
in
the
eyes
of
the
musketeer
the
consequence
and
the
proof
of
what
he
had
well
divined
at
piriac
was
it
a
wall
that
fouquet
was
constructing
was
it
a
fortification
that
he
was
erecting
to
ascertain
that
he
must
make
fuller
observations
d
artagnan
put
furet
into
a
stable
supped
went
to
bed
and
on
the
morrow
took
a
walk
upon
the
port
or
rather
upon
the
shingle
le
croisic
has
a
port
of
fifty
feet
it
has
a
which
resembles
an
enormous
brioche
a
kind
of
cake
elevated
on
a
dish
the
flat
strand
is
the
dish
hundreds
of
barrowsful
of
earth
amalgamated
with
pebbles
and
rounded
into
cones
with
sinuous
passages
between
are
and
brioches
at
the
same
time
it
is
so
now
and
it
was
so
two
hundred
years
ago
only
the
brioche
was
not
so
large
and
probably
there
were
to
be
seen
to
trellises
of
lath
around
the
brioche
which
constitute
an
ornament
planted
like
along
the
passages
that
wind
towards
the
little
terrace
upon
the
shingle
lounged
three
or
four
fishermen
talking
about
sardines
and
shrimps
d
artagnan
with
his
eyes
animated
by
a
rough
gayety
and
a
smile
upon
his
lips
approached
these
fishermen
any
fishing
going
on
said
he
yes
monsieur
replied
one
of
them
we
are
only
waiting
for
the
tide
where
do
you
fish
my
friends
upon
the
coasts
monsieur
which
are
the
best
coasts
ah
that
is
all
according
the
tour
of
the
isles
for
example
yes
but
they
are
a
long
way
off
those
isles
are
they
not
not
very
four
leagues
four
leagues
that
is
a
voyage
the
fishermen
laughed
in
agnan
s
face
hear
me
then
said
the
latter
with
an
air
of
simple
stupidity
four
leagues
off
you
lose
sight
of
land
do
you
not
why
not
always
ah
it
is
a
long
way
too
long
or
else
i
would
have
asked
you
to
take
me
aboard
and
to
show
me
what
i
have
never
seen
what
is
that
a
live
monsieur
comes
from
the
province
said
a
fisherman
yes
i
come
from
paris
the
breton
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
have
you
ever
seen
fouquet
in
paris
asked
he
often
replied
d
artagnan
often
repeated
the
fishermen
closing
their
circle
round
the
parisian
do
you
know
him
a
little
he
is
the
intimate
friend
of
my
master
ah
said
the
fishermen
in
astonishment
and
said
d
artagnan
i
have
seen
all
his
chateaux
of
saint
mande
of
vaux
and
his
hotel
in
paris
is
that
a
fine
place
superb
it
is
not
so
fine
a
place
as
said
the
fisherman
bah
cried
d
artagnan
breaking
into
a
laugh
so
loud
that
he
angered
all
his
auditors
it
is
very
plain
that
you
have
never
seen
said
the
most
curious
of
the
fishermen
do
you
know
that
there
are
six
leagues
of
it
and
that
there
are
such
trees
on
it
as
can
not
be
equaled
even
at
trees
in
the
sea
cried
d
artagnan
well
i
should
like
to
see
them
that
can
be
easily
done
we
are
fishing
at
the
isle
de
hoedic
come
with
us
from
that
place
you
will
see
as
a
paradise
the
black
trees
of
against
the
sky
you
will
see
the
white
line
of
the
castle
which
cuts
the
horizon
of
the
sea
like
a
blade
oh
said
d
artagnan
that
must
be
very
beautiful
but
do
you
know
there
are
a
hundred
belfries
at
fouquet
s
chateau
of
vaux
the
breton
raised
his
head
in
profound
admiration
but
he
was
not
convinced
a
hundred
belfries
ah
that
may
be
but
is
finer
than
that
should
you
like
to
see
is
that
possible
asked
d
artagnan
yes
with
permission
of
the
governor
but
i
do
not
know
the
governor
as
you
know
fouquet
you
can
tell
your
name
oh
my
friends
i
am
not
a
gentleman
everybody
enters
continued
the
fisherman
in
his
strong
pure
language
provided
he
means
no
harm
to
or
its
master
a
slight
shudder
crept
over
the
body
of
the
musketeer
that
is
true
thought
he
then
recovering
himself
if
i
were
sure
said
he
not
to
be
what
upon
her
said
the
fisherman
pointing
with
pride
to
his
pretty
bark
well
you
almost
persuade
me
cried
agnan
i
will
go
and
see
but
they
will
not
admit
me
we
shall
enter
safe
enough
you
what
for
why
dame
to
sell
fish
to
the
corsairs
ha
corsairs
what
do
you
mean
well
i
mean
that
fouquet
is
having
two
corsairs
built
to
chase
the
dutch
and
the
english
and
we
sell
our
fish
to
the
crews
of
those
little
vessels
come
come
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
better
and
better
a
bastions
and
corsairs
well
fouquet
is
not
an
enemy
to
be
despised
as
i
presumed
to
fancy
he
is
worth
the
trouble
of
travelling
to
see
him
nearer
we
set
out
at
five
said
the
fisherman
gravely
i
am
quite
ready
and
i
will
not
leave
you
now
so
d
artagnan
saw
the
fishermen
haul
their
barks
to
meet
the
tide
with
a
windlass
the
sea
rose
agnan
allowed
himself
to
be
hoisted
on
board
not
without
sporting
a
little
fear
and
awkwardness
to
the
amusement
of
the
young
who
watched
him
with
their
large
intelligent
eyes
he
laid
himself
down
upon
a
folded
sail
not
interfering
with
anything
whilst
the
bark
prepared
for
sea
and
with
its
large
square
sail
it
was
fairly
out
within
two
hours
the
fishermen
who
prosecuted
their
occupation
as
they
proceeded
did
not
perceive
that
their
passenger
had
not
become
pale
neither
groaned
nor
suffered
that
in
spite
of
that
horrible
tossing
and
rolling
of
the
bark
to
which
no
hand
imparted
direction
the
novice
passenger
had
preserved
his
presence
of
mind
and
his
appetite
they
fished
and
their
fishing
was
sufficiently
fortunate
to
lines
bated
with
prawn
soles
came
with
numerous
gambols
to
bite
two
nets
had
already
been
broken
by
the
immense
weight
of
congers
and
haddocks
three
plowed
the
hold
with
their
slimy
folds
and
their
dying
contortions
d
artagnan
brought
them
good
luck
they
told
him
so
the
soldier
found
the
occupation
so
pleasant
that
he
put
his
hand
to
the
work
that
is
to
say
to
the
lines
and
uttered
roars
of
joy
and
mordioux
enough
to
have
astonished
his
musketeers
themselves
every
time
that
a
shock
given
to
his
line
by
the
captured
fish
required
the
play
of
the
muscles
of
his
arm
and
the
employment
of
his
best
dexterity
the
party
of
pleasure
had
made
him
forget
his
diplomatic
mission
he
was
struggling
with
a
very
large
conger
and
holding
fast
with
one
hand
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
in
order
to
seize
with
the
other
the
gaping
jowl
of
his
antagonist
when
the
master
said
to
him
take
care
they
don
t
see
you
from
these
words
produced
the
same
effect
upon
d
artagnan
as
the
hissing
of
the
first
bullet
on
a
day
of
battle
he
let
go
of
both
line
and
conger
which
dragging
each
other
returned
again
to
the
water
d
artagnan
perceived
within
half
a
league
at
most
the
blue
and
marked
profile
of
the
rocks
of
dominated
by
the
majestic
whiteness
of
the
castle
in
the
distance
the
land
with
its
forests
and
verdant
plains
cattle
on
the
grass
this
was
what
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
musketeer
the
sun
darted
its
rays
of
gold
upon
the
sea
raising
a
shining
mist
round
this
enchanted
isle
little
could
be
seen
of
it
owing
to
this
dazzling
light
but
the
salient
points
every
shadow
was
strongly
marked
and
cut
with
bands
of
darkness
the
luminous
fields
and
walls
eh
eh
said
d
artagnan
at
the
aspect
of
those
masses
of
black
rocks
these
are
fortifications
which
do
not
stand
in
need
of
any
engineer
to
render
a
landing
difficult
how
the
devil
can
a
landing
be
effected
on
that
isle
which
god
has
defended
so
completely
this
way
replied
the
patron
of
the
bark
changing
the
sail
and
impressing
upon
the
rudder
a
twist
which
turned
the
boat
in
the
direction
of
a
pretty
little
port
quite
coquettish
round
and
newly
battlemented
what
the
devil
do
i
see
yonder
said
d
artagnan
you
see
locmaria
replied
the
fisherman
well
but
there
that
is
bangor
and
further
on
sauzon
and
then
le
palais
mordioux
it
is
a
world
ah
there
are
some
soldiers
there
are
seventeen
hundred
men
in
monsieur
replied
the
fisherman
proudly
do
you
know
that
the
least
garrison
is
of
twenty
companies
of
infantry
mordioux
cried
d
artagnan
stamping
with
his
foot
his
majesty
was
right
enough
they
landed
chapter
lxix
d
artagnan
was
to
meet
an
old
acquaintance
there
is
always
something
in
a
landing
if
it
be
only
from
the
smallest
a
trouble
and
a
confusion
which
do
not
leave
the
mind
the
liberty
of
which
it
stands
in
need
in
order
to
study
at
the
first
glance
the
new
locality
presented
to
it
the
moveable
bridges
the
agitated
sailors
the
noise
of
the
water
on
the
pebbles
the
cries
and
importunities
of
those
who
wait
upon
the
shores
are
multiplied
details
of
that
sensation
which
is
summed
up
in
one
single
result
hesitation
it
was
not
then
till
after
standing
several
minutes
on
the
shore
that
d
artagnan
saw
upon
the
port
but
more
particularly
in
the
interior
of
the
isle
an
immense
number
of
workmen
in
motion
at
his
feet
d
artagnan
recognized
the
five
chalands
laden
with
rough
stone
he
had
seen
leave
the
port
of
piriac
the
smaller
stones
were
transported
to
the
shore
by
means
of
a
chain
formed
by
or
thirty
peasants
the
large
stones
were
loaded
on
trollies
which
conveyed
them
in
the
same
direction
as
the
others
that
is
to
say
towards
the
works
of
which
d
artagnan
could
as
yet
appreciate
neither
the
strength
nor
the
extent
everywhere
was
to
be
seen
an
activity
equal
to
that
which
telemachus
observed
on
his
landing
at
salentum
d
artagnan
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
but
he
could
not
under
the
penalty
of
exciting
mistrust
exhibit
too
much
curiosity
he
advanced
then
little
by
little
scarcely
going
beyond
the
line
formed
by
the
fishermen
on
the
beach
observing
everything
saying
nothing
and
meeting
all
suspicion
that
might
have
been
excited
with
a
question
or
a
polite
bow
and
yet
whilst
his
companions
carried
on
their
trade
giving
or
selling
their
fish
to
the
workmen
or
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
d
artagnan
had
gained
by
degrees
and
reassured
by
the
little
attention
paid
to
him
he
began
to
cast
an
intelligent
and
confident
look
upon
the
men
and
things
that
appeared
before
his
eyes
and
his
very
first
glance
fell
on
certain
movements
of
earth
about
which
the
eye
of
a
soldier
could
not
be
mistaken
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
port
in
order
that
their
fires
should
converge
upon
the
great
axis
of
the
ellipse
formed
by
the
basin
in
the
first
place
two
batteries
had
been
raised
evidently
destined
to
receive
flank
pieces
for
d
artagnan
saw
the
workmen
finishing
the
platform
and
making
ready
the
in
wood
upon
which
the
wheels
of
the
pieces
might
turn
to
embrace
every
direction
over
the
epaulement
by
the
side
of
each
of
these
batteries
other
workmen
were
strengthening
gabions
filled
with
earth
the
lining
of
another
battery
the
latter
had
embrasures
and
the
overseer
of
the
works
called
successively
men
who
with
cords
tied
the
saucissons
and
cut
the
lozenges
and
right
angles
of
turfs
destined
to
retain
the
matting
of
the
embrasures
by
the
activity
displayed
in
these
works
already
so
far
advanced
they
might
be
considered
as
finished
they
were
not
yet
furnished
with
their
cannons
but
the
platforms
had
their
gites
and
their
madriers
all
prepared
the
earth
beaten
carefully
was
consolidated
and
supposing
the
artillery
to
be
on
the
island
in
less
than
two
or
three
days
the
port
might
be
completely
armed
that
which
astonished
d
artagnan
when
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
coast
batteries
to
the
fortifications
of
the
city
was
to
see
that
was
defended
by
an
entirely
new
system
of
which
he
had
often
heard
the
comte
de
la
fere
speak
as
a
wonderful
advance
but
of
which
he
had
as
yet
never
seen
the
application
these
fortifications
belonged
neither
to
the
dutch
method
of
marollais
nor
to
the
french
method
of
the
chevalier
antoine
de
ville
but
to
the
system
of
manesson
mallet
a
skillful
engineer
who
about
six
or
eight
years
previously
had
quitted
the
service
of
portugal
to
enter
that
of
france
the
works
had
this
peculiarity
that
instead
of
rising
above
the
earth
as
did
the
ancient
ramparts
destined
to
defend
a
city
from
escalades
they
on
the
contrary
sank
into
it
and
what
created
the
height
of
the
walls
was
the
depth
of
the
ditches
it
did
not
take
long
to
make
d
artagnan
perceive
the
superiority
of
such
a
system
which
gives
no
advantage
to
cannon
besides
as
the
fosses
were
lower
than
or
on
a
level
with
the
sea
these
fosses
could
be
instantly
inundated
by
means
of
subterranean
sluices
otherwise
the
works
were
almost
complete
and
a
group
of
workmen
receiving
orders
from
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
conductor
of
the
works
were
occupied
in
placing
the
last
stones
a
bridge
of
planks
thrown
over
the
fosses
for
the
greater
convenience
of
the
maneuvers
connected
with
the
barrows
joined
the
interior
to
the
exterior
with
an
air
of
simple
curiosity
d
artagnan
asked
if
he
might
be
permitted
to
cross
the
bridge
and
he
was
told
that
no
order
prevented
it
consequently
he
crossed
the
bridge
and
advanced
towards
the
group
this
group
was
superintended
by
the
man
whom
d
artagnan
had
already
remarked
and
who
appeared
to
be
the
a
plan
was
lying
open
before
him
upon
a
large
stone
forming
a
table
and
at
some
paces
from
him
a
crane
was
in
action
this
engineer
who
by
his
evident
importance
first
attracted
the
attention
of
d
artagnan
wore
a
justaucorps
which
from
its
sumptuousness
was
scarcely
in
harmony
with
the
work
he
was
employed
in
that
rather
necessitated
the
costume
of
a
than
of
a
noble
he
was
a
man
of
immense
stature
and
great
square
shoulders
and
wore
a
hat
covered
with
feathers
he
gesticulated
in
the
most
majestic
manner
and
appeared
for
d
artagnan
only
saw
his
back
to
be
scolding
the
workmen
for
their
idleness
and
want
of
strength
d
artagnan
continued
to
draw
nearer
at
that
moment
the
man
with
the
feathers
ceased
to
gesticulate
and
with
his
hands
placed
upon
his
knees
was
following
the
effort
of
six
workmen
to
raise
a
block
of
hewn
stone
to
the
top
of
a
piece
of
timber
destined
to
support
that
stone
so
that
the
cord
of
the
crane
might
be
passed
under
it
the
six
men
all
on
one
side
of
the
stone
united
their
efforts
to
raise
it
to
eight
or
ten
inches
from
the
ground
sweating
and
blowing
whilst
a
seventh
got
ready
for
when
there
should
be
daylight
enough
beneath
it
to
slide
in
the
roller
that
was
to
support
it
but
the
stone
had
already
twice
escaped
from
their
hands
before
gaining
a
sufficient
height
for
the
roller
to
be
introduced
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
every
time
the
stone
escaped
them
they
bounded
quickly
backwards
to
keep
their
feet
from
being
crushed
by
the
refalling
stone
every
time
the
stone
abandoned
by
them
sunk
deeper
into
the
damp
earth
which
rendered
the
operation
more
and
more
difficult
a
third
effort
was
followed
by
no
better
success
but
with
progressive
discouragement
and
yet
when
the
six
men
were
bent
towards
the
stone
the
man
with
the
feathers
had
himself
with
a
powerful
voice
given
the
word
of
command
ferme
which
regulates
maneuvers
of
strength
then
he
drew
himself
up
oh
oh
said
he
what
is
this
all
about
have
i
to
do
with
men
of
straw
corne
de
boeuf
stand
on
one
side
and
you
shall
see
how
this
is
to
be
done
peste
said
d
artagnan
will
he
pretend
to
raise
that
rock
that
would
be
a
sight
worth
looking
at
the
workmen
as
commanded
by
the
engineer
drew
back
with
their
ears
down
and
shaking
their
heads
with
the
exception
of
the
one
who
held
the
plank
who
prepared
to
perform
the
office
the
man
with
the
feathers
went
up
to
the
stone
stooped
slipped
his
hands
under
the
face
lying
upon
the
ground
stiffened
his
herculean
muscles
and
without
a
strain
with
a
slow
motion
like
that
of
a
machine
lifted
the
end
of
the
rock
a
foot
from
the
ground
the
workman
who
held
the
plank
profited
by
the
space
thus
given
him
and
slipped
the
roller
under
the
stone
that
s
the
way
said
the
giant
not
letting
the
rock
fall
again
but
placing
it
upon
its
support
mordioux
cried
d
artagnan
i
know
but
one
man
capable
of
such
a
feat
of
strength
hein
cried
the
colossus
turning
round
porthos
murmured
d
artagnan
seized
with
stupor
porthos
at
on
his
part
the
man
with
the
feathers
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
disguised
lieutenant
and
in
spite
of
his
metamorphosis
recognized
him
d
artagnan
cried
he
and
the
color
mounted
to
his
face
hush
said
he
to
d
artagnan
hush
in
his
turn
said
the
musketeer
in
fact
if
porthos
had
just
been
discovered
by
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
had
just
been
discovered
by
porthos
the
interest
of
the
particular
secret
of
each
struck
them
both
at
the
same
instant
nevertheless
the
first
movement
of
the
two
men
was
to
throw
their
arms
around
each
other
what
they
wished
to
conceal
from
the
bystanders
was
not
their
friendship
but
their
names
but
after
the
embrace
came
reflection
what
the
devil
brings
porthos
to
lifting
stones
said
d
artagnan
only
d
artagnan
uttered
that
question
in
a
low
voice
less
strong
in
diplomacy
than
his
friend
porthos
thought
aloud
how
the
devil
did
you
come
to
asked
he
of
d
artagnan
and
what
do
you
want
to
do
here
it
was
necessary
to
reply
without
hesitation
to
hesitate
in
answer
to
porthos
would
have
been
a
check
for
which
the
of
d
artagnan
would
never
have
consoled
itself
pardieu
my
friend
i
am
at
because
you
are
here
ah
bah
said
porthos
visibly
stupefied
with
the
argument
and
seeking
to
account
for
it
to
himself
with
the
felicity
of
deduction
we
know
to
be
particular
to
him
without
doubt
continued
d
artagnan
unwilling
to
give
his
friend
time
to
recollect
himself
i
have
been
to
see
you
at
pierrefonds
indeed
yes
and
you
did
not
find
me
there
no
but
i
found
mouston
is
he
well
peste
well
but
mouston
did
not
tell
you
i
was
here
why
should
he
not
have
i
perchance
deserved
to
lose
his
confidence
no
but
he
did
not
know
it
well
that
is
a
reason
at
least
that
does
not
offend
my
then
how
did
you
manage
to
find
me
my
dear
friend
a
great
noble
like
you
always
leaves
traced
behind
him
on
his
passage
and
i
should
think
but
poorly
of
myself
if
i
were
not
sharp
enough
to
follow
the
traces
of
my
friends
this
explanation
flattering
as
it
was
did
not
entirely
satisfy
porthos
but
i
left
no
traces
behind
me
for
i
came
here
disguised
said
porthos
ah
you
came
disguised
did
you
said
d
artagnan
yes
and
how
as
a
miller
and
do
you
think
a
great
noble
like
you
porthos
can
affect
common
manners
so
as
to
deceive
people
well
i
swear
to
you
my
friend
that
i
played
my
part
so
well
that
everybody
was
deceived
indeed
so
well
that
i
have
not
discovered
and
joined
you
yes
but
how
did
you
discover
and
join
me
stop
a
bit
i
was
going
to
tell
you
how
do
you
imagine
mouston
ah
it
was
that
fellow
mouston
said
porthos
gathering
up
those
two
triumphant
arches
which
served
him
for
eyebrows
but
stop
i
tell
you
it
was
no
fault
of
mouston
s
because
he
was
ignorant
of
where
you
were
i
know
he
was
and
that
is
why
i
am
in
such
haste
to
understand
oh
how
impatient
you
are
porthos
when
i
do
not
comprehend
i
am
terrible
well
you
will
understand
aramis
wrote
to
you
at
pierrefonds
did
he
not
yes
and
he
told
you
to
come
before
the
equinox
that
is
true
well
that
is
it
said
d
artagnan
hoping
that
this
reason
would
mystify
porthos
porthos
appeared
to
give
himself
up
to
a
violent
mental
labor
yes
yes
said
he
i
understand
as
aramis
told
me
to
come
before
the
equinox
you
have
understood
that
that
was
to
join
him
you
then
inquired
where
aramis
was
saying
to
yourself
where
aramis
is
there
porthos
will
you
have
learnt
that
aramis
was
in
bretagne
and
you
said
to
yourself
porthos
is
in
exactly
in
good
truth
porthos
i
can
not
tell
why
you
have
not
turned
conjuror
so
you
understand
that
arriving
at
i
heard
of
the
splendid
fortifications
going
on
at
the
account
raised
my
curiosity
i
embarked
in
a
fishing
boat
without
dreaming
that
you
were
here
i
came
and
i
saw
a
monstrous
fine
fellow
lifting
a
stone
ajax
could
not
have
stirred
i
cried
out
nobody
but
the
baron
de
bracieux
could
have
performed
such
a
feat
of
you
heard
me
you
turned
round
you
recognized
me
we
embraced
and
ma
foi
if
you
like
my
dear
friend
we
will
embrace
again
ah
now
all
is
explained
said
porthos
and
he
embraced
d
artagnan
with
so
much
friendship
as
to
deprive
the
musketeer
of
his
breath
for
five
minutes
why
you
are
stronger
than
ever
said
d
artagnan
and
still
happily
in
your
arms
porthos
saluted
d
artagnan
with
a
gracious
smile
during
the
five
minutes
d
artagnan
was
recovering
his
breath
he
reflected
that
he
had
a
very
difficult
part
to
play
it
was
necessary
that
he
always
should
question
and
never
reply
by
the
time
his
respiration
returned
he
had
fixed
his
plans
for
the
campaign
chapter
lxx
wherein
the
ideas
of
d
artagnan
begin
to
clear
up
a
little
d
artagnan
immediately
took
the
offensive
now
that
i
have
told
you
all
dear
friend
or
rather
you
have
guessed
all
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
here
covered
with
dust
and
mud
porthos
wiped
his
brow
and
looked
around
him
with
pride
why
it
appears
said
he
that
you
may
see
what
i
am
doing
here
no
doubt
no
doubt
you
lift
great
stones
oh
to
show
these
idle
fellows
what
a
man
is
said
porthos
with
contempt
but
you
understand
yes
that
is
not
your
place
to
lift
stones
although
there
are
many
whose
place
it
is
who
can
not
lift
them
as
you
do
it
was
that
which
made
me
ask
you
just
now
what
are
you
doing
here
baron
i
am
studying
topography
chevalier
you
are
studying
topography
yes
but
you
what
are
you
doing
in
that
common
dress
d
artagnan
perceived
he
had
committed
a
fault
in
giving
expression
to
his
astonishment
porthos
had
taken
advantage
of
it
to
retort
with
a
question
why
said
he
you
know
i
am
a
bourgeois
in
fact
my
dress
then
has
nothing
astonishing
in
it
since
it
conforms
with
my
condition
nonsense
you
are
a
musketeer
you
are
wrong
my
friend
i
have
given
in
my
resignation
bah
oh
mon
dieu
yes
and
you
have
abandoned
the
service
i
have
quitted
it
you
have
abandoned
the
king
quite
porthos
raised
his
arms
towards
heaven
like
a
man
who
has
heard
extraordinary
news
well
that
does
confound
me
said
he
it
is
nevertheless
true
and
what
led
you
to
form
such
a
resolution
the
king
displeased
me
mazarin
had
disgusted
me
for
a
long
time
as
you
know
so
i
threw
my
cassock
to
the
nettles
but
mazarin
is
dead
i
know
that
well
enough
parbleu
only
at
the
period
of
his
death
my
resignation
had
been
given
in
and
accepted
two
months
then
feeling
myself
free
i
set
off
for
pierrefonds
to
see
my
friend
porthos
i
had
heard
talk
of
the
happy
division
you
had
made
of
your
time
and
i
wished
for
a
fortnight
to
divide
mine
after
your
fashion
my
friend
you
know
that
it
is
not
for
a
fortnight
my
house
is
open
to
you
it
is
for
a
year
for
ten
years
for
life
thank
you
porthos
ah
but
perhaps
you
want
money
do
you
said
porthos
making
something
like
fifty
louis
chink
in
his
pocket
in
that
case
you
know
no
thank
you
i
am
not
in
want
of
anything
i
placed
my
savings
with
planchet
who
pays
me
the
interest
of
them
your
savings
yes
to
be
sure
said
d
artagnan
why
should
i
not
put
by
my
savings
as
well
as
another
porthos
oh
there
is
no
reason
why
on
the
contrary
i
always
suspected
you
that
is
to
say
aramis
always
suspected
you
to
have
savings
for
my
own
part
d
ye
see
i
take
no
concern
about
the
management
of
my
household
but
i
presume
the
savings
of
a
musketeer
must
be
small
no
doubt
relative
to
yourself
porthos
who
are
a
millionaire
but
you
shall
judge
i
had
laid
by
thousand
livres
that
s
pretty
well
said
porthos
with
an
affable
air
and
continued
d
artagnan
on
the
of
last
month
i
added
to
it
two
hundred
thousand
livres
more
porthos
opened
his
large
eyes
which
eloquently
demanded
of
the
musketeer
where
the
devil
did
you
steal
such
a
sum
as
that
my
dear
friend
two
hundred
thousand
livres
cried
he
at
length
yes
which
with
the
i
had
and
twenty
thousand
i
have
about
me
complete
the
sum
of
two
hundred
and
thousand
livres
but
tell
me
whence
comes
this
fortune
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
presently
dear
friend
but
as
you
have
in
the
first
place
many
things
to
tell
me
yourself
let
us
have
my
recital
in
its
proper
order
bravo
said
porthos
then
we
are
both
rich
but
what
can
i
have
to
relate
to
you
you
have
to
relate
to
me
how
aramis
came
to
be
named
ah
bishop
of
vannes
that
s
it
said
d
artagnan
bishop
of
vannes
dear
aramis
do
you
know
how
he
succeeded
so
well
yes
yes
without
reckoning
that
he
does
not
mean
to
stop
there
what
do
you
mean
he
will
not
be
contented
with
violet
stockings
and
that
he
wants
a
red
hat
hush
that
is
promised
him
bah
by
the
king
by
somebody
more
powerful
than
the
king
ah
the
devil
porthos
what
incredible
things
you
tell
me
my
friend
why
incredible
is
there
not
always
somebody
in
france
more
powerful
than
the
king
oh
yes
in
the
time
of
king
louis
xiii
it
was
cardinal
richelieu
in
the
time
of
the
regency
it
was
cardinal
mazarin
in
the
time
of
louis
xiv
it
is
m
go
on
it
is
m
fouquet
jove
you
have
hit
it
the
first
time
so
then
i
suppose
it
is
fouquet
who
has
promised
aramis
the
red
hat
porthos
assumed
an
air
of
reserve
dear
friend
said
he
god
preserve
me
from
meddling
with
the
affairs
of
others
above
all
from
revealing
secrets
it
may
be
to
their
interest
to
keep
when
you
see
aramis
he
will
tell
you
all
he
thinks
he
ought
to
tell
you
you
are
right
porthos
and
you
are
quite
a
padlock
for
safety
but
to
revert
to
yourself
yes
said
porthos
you
said
just
now
you
came
hither
to
study
topography
i
did
so
tudieu
my
friend
what
fine
things
you
will
do
how
do
you
mean
why
these
fortifications
are
admirable
is
that
your
opinion
decidedly
it
is
in
truth
to
anything
but
a
regular
siege
is
absolutely
impregnable
porthos
rubbed
his
hands
that
is
my
opinion
said
he
but
who
the
devil
has
fortified
this
paltry
little
place
in
this
manner
porthos
drew
himself
up
proudly
did
i
not
tell
you
who
no
do
you
not
suspect
no
all
i
can
say
is
that
he
is
a
man
who
has
studied
all
the
systems
and
who
appears
to
me
to
have
stopped
at
the
best
hush
said
porthos
consider
my
modesty
my
dear
d
artagnan
in
truth
replied
the
musketeer
can
it
be
you
who
oh
pray
my
dear
friend
you
who
have
imagined
traced
and
combined
between
these
bastions
these
redans
these
curtains
these
and
are
preparing
that
covered
way
i
beg
you
you
who
have
built
that
lunette
with
its
retiring
angles
and
its
salient
edges
my
friend
you
who
have
given
that
inclination
to
the
openings
of
your
embrasures
by
means
of
which
you
so
effectively
protect
the
men
who
serve
the
guns
eh
mon
dieu
yes
oh
porthos
porthos
i
must
bow
down
before
you
i
must
admire
you
but
you
have
always
concealed
from
us
this
superb
this
incomparable
genius
i
hope
my
dear
friend
you
will
show
me
all
this
in
detail
nothing
more
easy
here
lies
my
original
sketch
my
plan
show
it
me
porthos
led
d
artagnan
towards
the
stone
that
served
him
for
a
table
and
upon
which
the
plan
was
spread
at
the
foot
of
the
plan
was
written
in
the
formidable
writing
of
porthos
writing
of
which
we
have
already
had
occasion
to
speak
instead
of
making
use
of
the
square
or
rectangle
as
has
been
done
to
this
time
you
will
suppose
your
place
inclosed
in
a
regular
hexagon
this
polygon
having
the
advantage
of
offering
more
angles
than
the
quadrilateral
one
every
side
of
your
hexagon
of
which
you
will
determine
the
length
in
proportion
to
the
dimensions
taken
upon
the
place
will
be
divided
into
two
parts
and
upon
the
middle
point
you
will
elevate
a
perpendicular
towards
the
center
of
the
polygon
which
will
equal
in
length
the
sixth
part
of
the
side
by
the
extremities
of
each
side
of
the
polygon
you
will
trace
two
diagonals
which
will
cut
the
perpendicular
these
will
form
the
precise
lines
of
your
defense
the
devil
said
d
artagnan
stopping
at
this
point
of
the
demonstration
why
this
is
a
complete
system
porthos
entirely
said
porthos
continue
no
i
have
read
enough
of
it
but
since
it
is
you
my
dear
porthos
who
direct
the
works
what
need
have
you
of
setting
down
your
system
so
formally
in
writing
oh
my
dear
friend
death
how
death
why
we
are
all
mortal
are
we
not
that
is
true
said
d
artagnan
you
have
a
reply
for
everything
my
friend
and
he
replaced
the
plan
upon
the
stone
but
however
short
the
time
he
had
the
plan
in
his
hands
d
artagnan
had
been
able
to
distinguish
under
the
enormous
writing
of
porthos
a
much
more
delicate
hand
which
reminded
him
of
certain
letters
to
marie
michon
with
which
he
had
been
acquainted
in
his
youth
only
the
had
passed
and
repassed
so
often
over
this
writing
that
it
might
have
escaped
a
less
practiced
eye
than
that
of
our
musketeer
bravo
my
friend
bravo
said
d
artagnan
and
now
you
know
all
that
you
want
to
know
do
you
not
said
porthos
wheeling
about
mordioux
yes
only
do
me
one
last
favor
dear
friend
speak
i
am
master
here
do
me
the
pleasure
to
tell
me
the
name
of
that
gentleman
who
is
walking
yonder
where
there
behind
the
soldiers
followed
by
a
lackey
exactly
in
company
with
a
mean
sort
of
fellow
dressed
in
black
yes
i
mean
him
that
is
m
getard
and
who
is
getard
my
friend
he
is
the
architect
of
the
house
of
what
house
of
fouquet
s
house
ah
ah
cried
d
artagnan
you
are
of
the
household
of
fouquet
then
porthos
i
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
the
topographer
blushing
to
the
top
of
his
ears
why
you
say
the
house
when
speaking
of
as
if
you
were
speaking
of
the
chateau
of
pierrefonds
porthos
bit
his
lip
my
friend
said
he
belongs
to
fouquet
does
it
not
yes
i
believe
so
as
pierrefonds
belongs
to
me
i
told
you
i
believed
so
there
are
no
two
words
to
that
did
you
ever
see
a
man
there
who
is
accustomed
to
walk
about
with
a
ruler
in
his
hand
no
but
i
might
have
seen
him
there
if
he
really
walked
there
well
that
gentleman
is
m
boulingrin
who
is
m
boulingrin
now
we
are
coming
to
it
if
when
this
gentleman
is
walking
with
a
ruler
in
his
hand
any
one
should
ask
me
who
is
boulingrin
i
should
reply
he
is
the
architect
of
the
well
getard
is
the
boulingrin
of
fouquet
but
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fortifications
which
are
my
department
alone
do
you
understand
mine
absolutely
mine
ah
porthos
cried
d
artagnan
letting
his
arms
fall
as
a
conquered
man
gives
up
his
sword
ah
my
friend
you
are
not
only
a
herculean
topographer
you
are
still
further
a
dialectician
of
the
first
water
is
it
not
powerfully
reasoned
said
porthos
and
he
puffed
and
blew
like
the
conger
which
d
artagnan
had
let
slip
from
his
hand
and
now
said
d
artagnan
that
man
who
accompanies
getard
is
he
also
of
the
household
of
m
fouquet
oh
yes
said
porthos
with
contempt
it
is
one
jupenet
or
juponet
a
sort
of
poet
who
is
come
to
establish
himself
here
i
believe
so
i
thought
fouquet
had
poets
enough
yonder
scudery
loret
pelisson
la
fontaine
if
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
porthos
that
poet
disgraces
you
eh
my
friend
but
what
saves
us
is
that
he
is
not
here
as
a
poet
as
what
then
is
he
as
printer
and
you
make
me
remember
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
the
cuistre
say
it
then
porthos
made
a
sign
to
jupenet
who
perfectly
recollected
d
artagnan
and
did
not
care
to
come
nearer
which
naturally
produced
another
sign
from
porthos
this
was
so
imperative
he
was
obliged
to
obey
as
he
approached
come
hither
said
porthos
you
only
landed
yesterday
and
you
have
begun
your
tricks
already
how
so
monsieur
le
baron
asked
jupenet
trembling
your
press
was
groaning
all
night
monsieur
said
porthos
and
you
prevented
my
sleeping
corne
de
boeuf
monsieur
objected
jupenet
timidly
you
have
nothing
yet
to
print
therefore
you
have
no
occasion
to
set
your
press
going
what
did
you
print
last
night
monsieur
a
light
poem
of
my
own
composition
light
no
no
monsieur
the
press
groaned
pitifully
beneath
it
let
it
not
happen
again
do
you
understand
yes
monsieur
you
promise
me
i
do
monsieur
very
well
this
time
i
pardon
you
adieu
the
poet
retreated
as
humbly
as
he
had
approached
well
now
we
have
combed
that
fellow
s
head
let
us
breakfast
yes
replied
d
artagnan
let
us
breakfast
only
said
porthos
i
beg
you
to
observe
my
friend
that
we
only
have
two
hours
for
our
repast
what
would
you
have
we
will
try
to
make
two
hours
suffice
but
why
have
you
only
two
hours
because
it
is
high
tide
at
one
o
clock
and
with
the
tide
i
am
going
to
vannes
but
as
i
shall
return
my
dear
friend
you
can
stay
here
you
shall
be
master
i
have
a
good
cook
and
a
good
cellar
no
interrupted
d
artagnan
better
than
that
what
you
are
going
to
vannes
you
say
to
a
certainty
to
see
aramis
yes
well
i
came
from
paris
on
purpose
to
see
aramis
that
s
true
i
will
go
with
you
then
do
that
s
the
thing
only
i
ought
to
have
seen
aramis
first
and
you
after
but
man
proposes
and
god
disposes
i
have
begun
with
you
and
will
finish
with
aramis
very
well
and
in
how
many
hours
can
you
go
from
here
to
vannes
oh
pardieu
in
six
hours
three
hours
by
sea
to
sarzeau
three
hours
by
road
from
sarzeau
to
vannes
how
convenient
that
is
being
so
near
to
the
bishopric
do
you
often
go
to
vannes
yes
once
a
week
but
stop
till
i
get
my
plan
porthos
picked
up
his
plan
folded
it
carefully
and
engulfed
it
in
his
large
pocket
good
said
d
artagnan
aside
i
think
i
now
know
the
real
engineer
who
is
fortifying
two
hours
after
at
high
tide
porthos
and
d
artagnan
set
out
for
sarzeau
chapter
lxxi
a
procession
at
vannes
the
passage
from
to
sarzeau
was
made
rapidly
enough
thanks
to
one
of
those
little
corsairs
of
which
d
artagnan
had
been
told
during
his
voyage
and
which
shaped
for
fast
sailing
and
destined
for
the
chase
were
sheltered
at
that
time
in
the
roadstead
of
locmaria
where
one
of
them
with
a
quarter
of
its
performed
duty
between
and
the
continent
d
artagnan
had
an
opportunity
of
convincing
himself
that
porthos
though
engineer
and
topographer
was
not
deeply
versed
in
affairs
of
state
his
perfect
ignorance
with
any
other
might
have
passed
for
dissimulation
but
d
artagnan
knew
too
well
all
the
folds
and
refolds
of
his
porthos
not
to
find
a
secret
if
there
were
one
there
like
those
regular
minute
old
bachelors
who
know
how
to
find
with
their
eyes
shut
each
book
on
the
shelves
of
their
library
and
each
piece
of
linen
in
their
wardrobe
so
if
he
had
found
nothing
our
cunning
d
artagnan
in
rolling
and
unrolling
his
porthos
it
was
because
in
truth
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
be
it
so
said
d
artagnan
i
shall
get
to
know
more
at
vannes
in
half
an
hour
than
porthos
has
discovered
at
in
two
months
only
in
order
that
i
may
know
something
it
is
important
that
porthos
should
not
make
use
of
the
only
stratagem
i
leave
at
his
disposal
he
must
not
warn
aramis
of
my
arrival
all
the
care
of
the
musketeer
was
then
for
the
moment
confined
to
the
watching
of
porthos
and
let
us
hasten
to
say
porthos
did
not
deserve
all
this
mistrust
porthos
thought
of
no
evil
perhaps
on
first
seeing
him
d
artagnan
had
inspired
him
with
a
little
suspicion
but
almost
immediately
d
artagnan
had
reconquered
in
that
good
and
brave
heart
the
place
he
had
always
occupied
and
not
the
least
cloud
darkened
the
large
eye
of
porthos
fixed
from
time
to
time
with
tenderness
on
his
friend
on
landing
porthos
inquired
if
his
horses
were
waiting
and
soon
perceived
them
at
the
crossing
of
the
road
that
winds
round
sarzeau
and
which
without
passing
through
that
little
city
leads
towards
vannes
these
horses
were
two
in
number
one
for
de
vallon
and
one
for
his
equerry
for
porthos
had
an
equerry
since
mouston
was
only
able
to
use
a
carriage
as
a
means
of
locomotion
d
artagnan
expected
that
porthos
would
propose
to
send
forward
his
equerry
upon
one
horse
to
bring
back
another
and
he
d
artagnan
had
made
up
his
mind
to
oppose
this
proposition
but
nothing
d
artagnan
had
expected
happened
porthos
simply
told
the
equerry
to
dismount
and
await
his
return
at
sarzeau
whilst
d
artagnan
would
ride
his
horse
which
was
arranged
eh
but
you
are
quite
a
man
of
precaution
my
dear
porthos
said
d
artagnan
to
his
friend
when
he
found
himself
in
the
saddle
upon
the
equerry
s
horse
yes
but
this
is
a
kindness
on
the
part
of
aramis
i
have
not
my
stud
here
and
aramis
has
placed
his
stables
at
my
disposal
good
horses
for
bishop
s
horses
mordioux
said
d
artagnan
it
is
true
aramis
is
a
bishop
of
a
peculiar
kind
he
is
a
holy
man
replied
porthos
in
a
tone
almost
nasal
and
with
his
eyes
raised
towards
heaven
then
he
is
much
changed
said
d
artagnan
you
and
i
have
known
him
passably
profane
grace
has
touched
him
said
porthos
bravo
said
d
artagnan
that
redoubles
my
desire
to
see
my
dear
old
friend
and
he
spurred
his
horse
which
sprang
off
into
a
more
rapid
pace
peste
said
porthos
if
we
go
on
at
this
rate
we
shall
only
take
one
hour
instead
of
two
to
go
how
far
do
you
say
porthos
four
leagues
and
a
half
that
will
be
a
good
pace
i
could
have
embarked
you
on
the
canal
but
the
devil
take
rowers
and
the
first
are
like
tortoises
the
second
like
snails
and
when
a
man
is
able
to
put
a
good
horse
between
his
knees
that
horse
is
better
than
rowers
or
any
other
means
you
are
right
you
above
all
porthos
who
always
look
magnificent
on
horseback
rather
heavy
my
friend
i
was
weighed
the
other
day
and
what
do
you
weigh
three
said
porthos
proudly
bravo
so
that
you
must
perceive
i
am
forced
to
choose
horses
whose
loins
are
straight
and
wide
otherwise
i
break
them
down
in
two
hours
yes
giant
s
horses
you
must
have
must
you
not
you
are
very
polite
my
friend
replied
the
engineer
with
affectionate
majesty
as
a
case
in
point
replied
d
artagnan
your
horse
seems
to
sweat
already
dame
it
is
hot
ah
ah
do
you
see
vannes
now
yes
perfectly
it
is
a
handsome
city
apparently
charming
according
to
aramis
at
least
but
i
think
it
black
but
black
seems
to
be
considered
handsome
by
artists
i
am
sorry
for
it
why
so
porthos
because
i
have
lately
had
my
chateau
of
pierrefonds
which
was
gray
with
age
plastered
white
humph
said
d
artagnan
and
white
is
more
cheerful
yes
but
it
is
less
august
as
aramis
tells
me
fortunately
there
are
dealers
in
black
as
well
as
white
i
will
have
pierrefonds
replastered
in
black
that
s
all
there
is
about
it
if
gray
is
handsome
you
understand
my
friend
black
must
be
superb
dame
said
d
artagnan
that
appears
logical
were
you
never
at
vannes
d
artagnan
never
then
you
know
nothing
of
the
city
nothing
well
look
said
porthos
raising
himself
in
his
stirrups
which
made
the
of
his
horse
bend
sadly
do
you
see
that
corner
in
the
sun
yonder
yes
i
see
it
plainly
well
that
is
the
cathedral
which
is
called
now
look
again
in
the
faubourg
on
the
left
do
you
see
another
cross
perfectly
well
that
is
the
parish
preferred
by
aramis
indeed
without
doubt
you
see
passes
for
having
been
the
first
bishop
of
vannes
it
is
true
that
aramis
pretends
he
was
not
but
he
is
so
learned
that
that
may
be
only
a
paro
a
para
a
paradox
said
d
artagnan
precisely
thank
you
my
tongue
trips
i
am
so
hot
my
friend
said
d
artagnan
continue
your
interesting
description
i
beg
what
is
that
large
white
building
with
many
windows
oh
that
is
the
college
of
the
jesuits
pardieu
you
have
an
apt
hand
do
you
see
close
to
the
college
a
large
house
with
steeples
turrets
built
in
a
handsome
gothic
style
as
that
fool
getard
says
yes
that
is
plainly
to
be
seen
well
well
that
is
where
aramis
resides
what
does
he
not
reside
at
the
episcopal
palace
no
that
is
in
ruins
the
palace
likewise
is
in
the
city
and
aramis
prefers
the
faubourgs
that
is
why
as
i
told
you
he
is
partial
to
is
in
the
faubourg
besides
there
are
in
this
faubourg
a
mall
a
and
a
house
of
dominicans
look
that
where
the
handsome
steeple
rises
to
the
heavens
well
next
you
see
the
faubourg
is
like
a
separate
city
it
has
its
walls
its
towers
its
ditches
the
quay
is
upon
it
likewise
and
the
boats
land
at
the
quay
if
our
little
corsair
did
not
draw
eight
feet
of
water
we
could
have
come
full
sail
up
to
aramis
s
windows
porthos
porthos
cried
d
artagnan
you
are
a
well
of
knowledge
a
spring
of
ingenious
and
profound
reflections
porthos
you
no
longer
surprise
me
you
confound
me
here
we
are
said
porthos
turning
the
conversation
with
his
usual
modesty
and
high
time
we
were
thought
d
artagnan
for
aramis
s
horse
is
melting
away
like
a
steed
of
ice
they
entered
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
faubourg
but
scarcely
had
they
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
they
were
surprised
to
find
the
streets
strewed
with
leaves
and
flowers
against
the
old
walls
of
vannes
hung
the
oldest
and
the
strangest
tapestries
of
france
from
over
balconies
fell
long
white
sheets
stuck
all
over
with
bouquets
the
streets
were
deserted
it
was
plain
the
entire
population
was
assembled
on
one
point
the
blinds
were
closed
and
the
breeze
penetrated
into
the
houses
under
the
hangings
which
cast
long
black
shades
between
their
places
of
issue
and
the
walls
suddenly
at
the
turning
of
a
street
chants
struck
the
ears
of
the
newly
arrived
travelers
a
crowd
in
holiday
garb
appeared
through
the
vapors
of
incense
which
mounted
to
the
heavens
in
blue
fleeces
and
clouds
of
fluttered
as
high
as
the
first
stories
above
all
heads
were
to
be
seen
the
cross
and
banners
the
sacred
symbols
of
religion
then
beneath
these
crosses
and
banners
as
if
protected
by
them
walked
a
whole
world
of
young
girls
clothed
in
white
crowned
with
at
the
two
sides
of
the
street
inclosing
the
cortege
marched
the
guards
of
the
garrison
carrying
bouquets
in
the
barrels
of
their
muskets
and
on
the
points
of
their
lances
this
was
the
procession
whilst
d
artagnan
and
porthos
were
looking
on
with
critical
glances
which
disguised
an
extreme
impatience
to
get
forward
a
magnificent
dais
approached
preceded
by
a
hundred
jesuits
and
a
hundred
dominicans
and
escorted
by
two
archdeacons
a
treasurer
a
penitent
and
twelve
canons
a
singer
with
a
thundering
voice
a
man
certainly
picked
out
from
all
the
voices
of
france
as
was
the
of
the
imperial
guard
from
all
the
giants
of
the
empire
escorted
by
four
other
chanters
who
appeared
to
be
there
only
to
serve
him
as
an
accompaniment
made
the
air
resound
and
the
windows
of
the
houses
vibrate
under
the
dais
appeared
a
pale
and
noble
countenance
with
black
eyes
black
hair
streaked
with
threads
of
white
a
delicate
compressed
mouth
a
prominent
and
angular
chin
his
head
full
of
graceful
majesty
was
covered
with
the
episcopal
mitre
a
headdress
which
gave
it
in
addition
to
the
character
of
sovereignty
that
of
asceticism
and
evangelic
meditation
aramis
cried
the
musketeer
involuntarily
as
this
lofty
countenance
passed
before
him
the
prelate
started
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
he
raised
his
large
black
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
and
turned
them
without
hesitation
towards
the
spot
whence
the
exclamation
proceeded
at
a
glance
he
saw
porthos
and
d
artagnan
close
to
him
on
his
part
d
artagnan
thanks
to
the
keenness
of
his
sight
had
seen
all
seized
all
the
full
portrait
of
the
prelate
had
entered
his
memory
never
to
leave
it
one
thing
had
particularly
struck
d
artagnan
on
perceiving
him
aramis
had
colored
then
he
had
concentrated
under
his
eyelids
the
fire
of
the
look
of
the
master
and
the
indefinable
affection
of
the
friend
it
was
evident
that
aramis
had
asked
himself
this
question
why
is
d
artagnan
with
porthos
and
what
does
he
want
at
vannes
aramis
comprehended
all
that
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
d
artagnan
on
turning
his
look
upon
him
again
and
seeing
that
he
had
not
lowered
his
eyes
he
knew
the
acuteness
and
intelligence
of
his
friend
he
feared
to
let
him
divine
the
secret
of
his
blush
and
his
astonishment
he
was
still
the
same
aramis
always
having
a
secret
to
conceal
therefore
to
put
an
end
to
his
look
of
an
inquisitor
which
it
was
necessary
to
get
rid
of
at
all
events
as
at
any
price
a
general
extinguishes
a
battery
which
annoys
him
aramis
stretched
forth
his
beautiful
white
hand
upon
which
sparkled
the
amethyst
of
the
pastoral
ring
he
cut
the
air
with
sign
of
the
cross
and
poured
out
his
benediction
upon
his
two
friends
perhaps
thoughtful
and
absent
d
artagnan
impious
in
spite
of
himself
might
not
have
bent
beneath
this
holy
benediction
but
porthos
saw
his
distraction
and
laying
his
friendly
hand
upon
the
back
of
his
companion
he
crushed
him
down
towards
the
earth
d
artagnan
was
forced
to
give
way
indeed
he
was
little
short
of
being
flat
on
the
ground
in
the
meantime
aramis
had
passed
d
artagnan
like
antaeus
had
only
touched
the
ground
and
he
turned
towards
porthos
almost
angry
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
intention
of
the
brave
hercules
it
was
a
feeling
of
religious
propriety
that
had
influenced
him
besides
speech
with
porthos
instead
of
disguising
his
thought
always
completed
it
it
is
very
polite
of
him
said
he
to
have
given
his
benediction
to
us
alone
decidedly
he
is
a
holy
man
and
a
brave
man
less
convinced
than
porthos
d
artagnan
made
no
reply
observe
my
friend
continued
porthos
he
has
seen
us
and
instead
of
continuing
to
walk
on
at
the
simple
pace
of
the
procession
as
he
did
just
now
see
what
a
hurry
he
is
in
do
you
see
how
the
cortege
is
increasing
its
speed
he
is
eager
to
join
us
and
embrace
us
is
that
dear
aramis
that
is
true
replied
d
artagnan
then
to
himself
it
is
equally
true
he
has
seen
me
the
fox
and
will
have
time
to
prepare
himself
to
receive
me
but
the
procession
had
passed
the
road
was
free
d
artagnan
and
porthos
walked
straight
up
to
the
episcopal
palace
which
was
surrounded
by
a
numerous
crowd
anxious
to
see
the
prelate
return
d
artagnan
remarked
that
this
crowd
was
composed
principally
of
citizens
and
military
men
he
recognized
in
the
nature
of
these
partisans
the
address
of
his
friend
aramis
was
not
the
man
to
seek
for
a
useless
popularity
he
cared
very
little
for
being
beloved
by
people
who
could
be
of
no
service
to
him
women
children
and
old
men
that
is
to
say
the
cortege
of
ordinary
pastors
was
not
the
cortege
for
him
ten
minutes
after
the
two
friends
had
passed
the
threshold
of
the
palace
aramis
returned
like
a
triumphant
conqueror
the
soldiers
presented
arms
to
him
as
to
a
superior
the
citizens
bowed
to
him
as
to
a
friend
and
a
patron
rather
than
as
a
head
of
the
church
there
was
something
in
aramis
resembling
those
roman
senators
who
had
their
doors
always
surrounded
by
clients
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
he
had
a
conference
of
half
a
minute
with
a
jesuit
who
in
order
to
speak
to
him
more
secretly
passed
his
head
under
the
dais
he
then
his
palace
the
doors
closed
slowly
and
the
crowd
melted
away
whilst
chants
and
prayers
were
still
resounding
abroad
it
was
a
magnificent
day
earthly
perfumes
were
mingled
with
the
perfumes
of
the
air
and
the
sea
the
city
breathed
happiness
joy
and
strength
d
artagnan
felt
something
like
the
presence
of
an
invisible
hand
which
had
created
this
strength
this
joy
this
happiness
and
spread
everywhere
these
perfumes
oh
oh
said
he
porthos
has
got
fat
but
aramis
is
grown
taller
chapter
lxxii
the
grandeur
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
porthos
and
d
artagnan
had
entered
the
bishop
s
residence
by
a
private
door
as
his
personal
friends
of
course
porthos
served
d
artagnan
as
guide
the
worthy
baron
comported
himself
everywhere
rather
as
if
he
were
at
home
nevertheless
whether
it
was
a
tacit
acknowledgement
of
the
sanctity
of
the
personage
of
aramis
and
his
character
or
the
habit
of
respecting
him
who
imposed
upon
him
morally
a
worthy
habit
which
had
always
made
porthos
a
model
soldier
and
an
excellent
companion
for
all
these
reasons
say
we
porthos
preserved
in
the
palace
of
his
greatness
the
bishop
of
vannes
a
sort
of
reserve
which
d
artagnan
remarked
at
once
in
the
attitude
he
took
with
respect
to
the
valets
and
officers
and
yet
this
reserve
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
prevent
his
asking
questions
porthos
questioned
they
learned
that
his
greatness
had
just
returned
to
his
apartment
and
was
preparing
to
appear
in
familiar
intimacy
less
majestic
than
he
had
appeared
with
his
flock
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
which
d
artagnan
and
porthos
passed
in
looking
mutually
at
each
other
with
the
white
of
their
eyes
and
turning
their
thumbs
in
all
the
different
evolutions
which
go
from
north
to
south
a
door
of
the
chamber
opened
and
his
greatness
appeared
dressed
in
the
undress
complete
of
a
prelate
aramis
carried
his
head
high
like
a
man
accustomed
to
command
his
violet
robe
was
tucked
up
on
one
side
and
his
white
hand
was
on
his
hip
he
had
retained
the
fine
mustache
and
the
lengthened
royale
of
the
time
of
louis
xiii
he
exhaled
on
entering
that
delicate
perfume
which
among
elegant
men
and
women
of
high
fashion
never
changes
and
appears
to
be
incorporated
in
the
person
of
whom
it
has
become
the
natural
emanation
in
this
case
only
the
perfume
had
retained
something
of
the
religious
sublimity
of
incense
it
no
longer
intoxicated
it
penetrated
it
no
longer
inspired
desire
it
inspired
respect
aramis
on
entering
the
chamber
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
and
without
pronouncing
one
word
which
whatever
it
might
be
would
have
been
cold
on
such
an
occasion
he
went
straight
up
to
the
musketeer
so
well
disguised
under
the
costume
of
agnan
and
pressed
him
in
his
arms
with
a
tenderness
which
the
most
distrustful
could
not
have
suspected
of
coldness
or
affectation
d
artagnan
on
his
part
embraced
him
with
equal
ardor
porthos
pressed
the
delicate
hand
of
aramis
in
his
immense
hands
and
d
artagnan
remarked
that
his
greatness
gave
him
his
left
hand
probably
from
habit
seeing
that
porthos
already
ten
times
had
been
near
injuring
his
fingers
covered
with
rings
by
pounding
his
flesh
in
the
vise
of
his
fist
warned
by
the
pain
aramis
was
cautious
and
only
presented
flesh
to
be
bruised
and
not
fingers
to
be
crushed
against
the
gold
or
the
angles
of
diamonds
between
two
embraces
aramis
looked
d
artagnan
in
the
face
offered
him
a
chair
sitting
down
himself
in
the
shade
observing
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
the
face
of
his
interlocutor
this
maneuver
familiar
to
diplomatists
and
women
resembles
much
the
advantage
of
the
guard
which
according
to
their
skill
or
habit
combatants
endeavor
to
take
on
the
ground
at
a
duel
d
artagnan
was
not
the
dupe
of
this
maneuver
but
he
did
not
appear
to
perceive
it
he
felt
himself
caught
but
precisely
because
he
was
caught
he
felt
himself
on
the
road
to
discovery
and
it
little
imported
to
him
old
condottiere
as
he
was
to
be
beaten
in
appearance
provided
he
drew
from
his
pretended
defeat
the
advantages
of
victory
aramis
began
the
conversation
ah
dear
friend
my
good
d
artagnan
said
he
what
an
excellent
chance
it
is
a
chance
my
reverend
companion
said
d
artagnan
that
i
will
call
friendship
i
seek
you
as
i
always
have
sought
you
when
i
had
any
grand
enterprise
to
propose
to
you
or
some
hours
of
liberty
to
give
you
ah
indeed
said
aramis
without
explosion
you
have
been
seeking
me
eh
yes
he
has
been
seeking
you
aramis
said
porthos
and
the
proof
is
that
he
has
unharbored
me
at
that
is
amiable
is
it
not
ah
yes
said
aramis
at
certainly
good
said
d
artagnan
there
is
my
booby
porthos
without
thinking
of
it
has
fired
the
first
cannon
of
attack
at
said
aramis
in
that
hole
in
that
desert
that
is
kind
indeed
and
it
was
i
who
told
him
you
were
at
vannes
continued
porthos
in
the
same
tone
d
artagnan
armed
his
mouth
with
a
finesse
almost
ironical
yes
i
knew
but
i
was
willing
to
see
replied
he
to
see
what
if
our
old
friendship
still
held
out
if
on
seeing
each
other
our
hearts
hardened
as
they
are
by
age
would
still
let
the
old
cry
of
joy
escape
which
salutes
the
coming
of
a
friend
well
and
you
must
have
been
satisfied
said
aramis
so
so
how
is
that
yes
porthos
said
hush
and
you
well
and
i
and
you
gave
me
your
benediction
what
would
you
have
my
friend
said
aramis
smiling
that
is
the
most
precious
thing
that
a
poor
prelate
like
me
has
to
give
indeed
my
dear
friend
doubtless
and
yet
they
say
at
paris
that
the
bishopric
of
vannes
is
one
of
the
best
in
france
ah
you
are
now
speaking
of
temporal
wealth
said
aramis
with
a
careless
air
to
be
sure
i
wish
to
speak
of
that
i
hold
by
it
on
my
part
in
that
case
let
me
speak
of
it
said
aramis
with
a
smile
you
own
yourself
to
be
one
of
the
richest
prelates
in
france
my
friend
since
you
ask
me
to
give
you
an
account
i
will
tell
you
that
the
bishopric
of
vannes
is
worth
about
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
neither
more
nor
less
it
is
a
diocese
which
contains
a
hundred
and
sixty
parishes
that
is
very
pretty
said
d
artagnan
it
is
superb
said
porthos
and
yet
resumed
d
artagnan
throwing
his
eyes
over
aramis
you
don
t
mean
to
bury
yourself
here
forever
pardon
me
only
i
do
not
admit
the
word
bury
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
this
distance
from
paris
a
man
is
buried
or
nearly
so
my
friend
i
am
getting
old
said
aramis
the
noise
and
bustle
of
a
city
no
longer
suit
me
at
we
ought
to
seek
calm
and
meditation
i
have
found
them
here
what
is
there
more
beautiful
and
stern
at
the
same
time
than
this
old
armorica
i
find
here
dear
d
artagnan
all
that
is
opposite
to
what
i
formerly
loved
and
that
is
what
must
happen
at
the
end
of
life
which
is
opposite
to
the
beginning
a
little
of
my
old
pleasure
of
former
times
still
comes
to
salute
me
here
now
and
then
without
diverting
me
from
the
road
of
salvation
i
am
still
of
this
world
and
yet
every
step
that
i
take
brings
me
nearer
to
god
eloquent
wise
and
discreet
you
are
an
accomplished
prelate
aramis
and
i
offer
you
my
congratulations
but
said
aramis
smiling
you
did
not
come
here
only
for
the
purpose
of
paying
me
compliments
speak
what
brings
you
hither
may
it
be
that
in
some
fashion
or
other
you
want
me
thank
god
no
my
friend
said
d
artagnan
it
is
nothing
of
that
i
am
rich
and
free
rich
exclaimed
aramis
yes
rich
for
me
not
for
you
or
porthos
understand
i
have
an
income
of
about
fifteen
thousand
livres
aramis
looked
at
him
suspiciously
he
could
not
believe
particularly
on
seeing
his
friend
in
such
humble
guise
that
he
had
made
so
fine
a
fortune
then
d
artagnan
seeing
that
the
hour
of
explanations
was
come
related
the
history
of
his
english
adventures
during
the
recital
he
saw
ten
times
the
eyes
of
the
prelate
sparkle
and
his
slender
fingers
work
convulsively
as
to
porthos
it
was
not
admiration
he
manifested
for
d
artagnan
it
was
enthusiasm
it
was
delirium
when
d
artagnan
had
finished
well
said
aramis
well
said
d
artagnan
you
see
then
i
have
in
england
friends
and
property
in
france
a
treasure
if
your
heart
tells
you
so
i
offer
them
to
you
that
is
what
i
came
here
for
however
firm
was
his
look
he
could
not
this
time
support
the
look
of
aramis
he
allowed
therefore
his
eye
to
stray
upon
porthos
like
the
sword
which
yields
to
too
powerful
a
pressure
and
seeks
another
road
at
all
events
said
the
bishop
you
have
assumed
a
singular
traveling
costume
old
friend
frightful
i
know
it
is
you
may
understand
why
i
would
not
travel
as
a
cavalier
or
a
noble
since
i
became
rich
i
am
miserly
and
you
say
then
you
came
to
said
aramis
without
transition
yes
replied
d
artagnan
i
knew
i
should
find
you
and
porthos
there
find
me
cried
aramis
me
for
the
last
year
past
i
have
not
once
crossed
the
sea
oh
said
d
artagnan
i
should
never
have
supposed
you
such
a
housekeeper
ah
dear
friend
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
no
longer
the
aramis
of
former
times
riding
on
horseback
is
unpleasant
to
me
the
sea
fatigues
me
i
am
a
poor
ailing
priest
always
complaining
always
grumbling
and
inclined
to
the
austerities
which
appear
to
accord
with
old
age
preliminary
parleyings
with
death
i
linger
my
dear
d
artagnan
i
linger
well
that
is
all
the
better
my
friend
for
we
shall
probably
be
neighbors
soon
bah
said
aramis
with
a
degree
of
surprise
he
did
not
even
seek
to
dissemble
you
my
neighbor
mordioux
yes
how
so
i
am
about
to
purchase
some
very
profitable
which
are
situated
between
piriac
and
le
croisic
imagine
my
dear
friend
a
clear
profit
of
twelve
per
cent
never
any
deficiency
never
any
idle
expenses
the
ocean
faithful
and
regular
brings
every
twelve
hours
its
contingency
to
my
coffers
i
am
the
first
parisian
who
has
dreamt
of
such
a
speculation
do
not
say
anything
about
it
i
beg
of
you
and
in
a
short
time
we
will
communicate
on
the
matter
i
am
to
have
three
leagues
of
country
for
thirty
thousand
livres
aramis
darted
a
look
at
porthos
as
if
to
ask
if
all
this
were
true
if
some
snare
were
not
concealed
beneath
this
outward
indifference
but
soon
as
if
ashamed
of
having
consulted
this
poor
auxiliary
he
collected
all
his
forces
for
a
fresh
assault
and
new
defense
i
heard
that
you
had
had
some
difference
with
the
court
but
that
you
had
come
out
of
it
as
you
know
how
to
get
through
everything
d
artagnan
with
the
honors
of
war
i
said
the
musketeer
with
a
burst
of
laughter
that
did
not
conceal
his
embarrassment
for
from
those
words
aramis
was
not
unlikely
to
be
acquainted
with
his
last
relations
with
the
king
i
oh
tell
me
all
about
that
pray
aramis
yes
it
was
related
to
me
a
poor
bishop
lost
in
the
middle
of
the
landes
that
the
king
had
taken
you
as
the
confidant
of
his
amours
with
whom
with
mademoiselle
de
mancini
d
artagnan
breathed
freely
again
ah
i
don
t
say
no
to
that
replied
he
it
appears
that
the
king
took
you
one
morning
over
the
bridge
of
blois
to
talk
with
his
that
s
true
said
d
artagnan
and
you
know
that
do
you
well
then
you
must
know
that
the
same
day
i
gave
in
my
resignation
what
sincerely
nothing
more
so
it
was
after
that
then
that
you
went
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
s
yes
afterwards
to
me
yes
and
then
porthos
yes
was
it
in
order
to
pay
us
a
simple
visit
no
i
did
no
know
you
were
engaged
and
i
wished
to
take
you
with
me
into
england
yes
i
understand
and
then
you
executed
alone
wonderful
man
as
you
are
what
you
wanted
to
propose
to
us
all
four
i
suspected
you
had
something
to
do
with
that
famous
restoration
when
i
learned
that
you
had
been
seen
at
king
charles
s
receptions
and
that
he
appeared
to
treat
you
like
a
friend
or
rather
like
a
person
to
whom
he
was
under
an
obligation
but
how
the
devil
did
you
learn
all
that
asked
d
artagnan
who
began
to
fear
that
the
investigation
of
aramis
had
extended
further
than
he
wished
dear
d
artagnan
said
the
prelate
my
friendship
resembles
in
a
degree
the
solicitude
of
that
night
watch
whom
we
have
in
the
little
tower
of
the
mole
at
the
extremity
of
the
quay
that
brave
man
every
night
lights
a
lantern
to
direct
the
barks
that
come
from
sea
he
is
concealed
in
his
and
the
fishermen
do
not
see
him
but
he
follows
them
with
interest
he
divines
them
he
calls
them
he
attracts
them
into
the
way
to
the
port
i
resemble
this
watcher
from
time
to
time
some
news
reaches
me
and
recalls
to
my
remembrance
all
those
i
loved
then
i
follow
the
friends
of
old
days
over
the
stormy
ocean
of
the
world
i
a
poor
watcher
to
whom
god
has
kindly
given
the
shelter
of
a
well
what
did
i
do
when
i
came
from
england
ah
there
replied
aramis
you
get
beyond
my
depth
i
know
nothing
of
you
since
your
return
d
artagnan
my
eyes
are
dim
i
regretted
you
did
not
think
of
me
i
wept
over
your
forgetfulness
i
was
wrong
i
see
you
again
and
it
is
a
festival
a
great
festival
i
assure
you
solemnly
how
is
athos
very
well
thank
you
and
our
young
pupil
raoul
he
seems
to
have
inherited
the
skill
of
his
father
athos
and
the
strength
of
his
tutor
porthos
and
on
what
occasion
have
you
been
able
to
judge
of
that
eh
mon
dieu
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
from
paris
indeed
tell
me
all
about
it
yes
there
was
an
execution
at
the
greve
and
in
consequence
of
that
execution
a
riot
we
happened
by
accident
to
be
in
the
riot
and
in
this
riot
we
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
our
swords
and
he
did
wonders
bah
what
did
he
do
why
in
the
first
place
he
threw
a
man
out
of
the
window
as
he
would
have
flung
a
sack
full
of
flock
come
that
s
pretty
well
said
porthos
then
he
drew
and
cut
and
thrust
away
as
we
fellows
used
to
do
in
the
good
old
times
and
what
was
the
cause
of
this
riot
said
porthos
d
artagnan
remarked
upon
the
face
of
aramis
a
complete
indifference
to
this
question
of
porthos
why
said
he
fixing
his
eyes
upon
aramis
on
account
of
the
two
farmers
of
the
revenue
friends
of
fouquet
whom
the
king
forced
to
disgorge
their
plunder
and
then
hanged
them
a
scarcely
perceptible
contraction
of
the
prelate
s
brow
showed
that
he
had
heard
d
artagnan
s
reply
oh
oh
said
porthos
and
what
were
the
names
of
these
friends
of
m
fouquet
mm
d
eymeris
and
lyodot
said
d
artagnan
do
you
know
these
names
aramis
no
said
the
prelate
disdainfully
they
sound
like
the
names
of
financiers
exactly
so
they
were
oh
fouquet
allows
his
friends
to
be
hanged
then
said
porthos
and
why
not
said
aramis
why
it
seems
to
me
if
these
culprits
were
hanged
it
was
by
order
of
the
king
now
fouquet
although
superintendent
of
the
finances
has
not
i
believe
the
right
of
life
and
death
that
may
be
said
porthos
but
in
the
place
of
fouquet
aramis
was
afraid
porthos
was
about
to
say
something
awkward
so
interrupted
him
come
d
artagnan
said
he
this
is
quite
enough
about
other
people
let
us
talk
a
little
about
you
of
me
you
know
all
that
i
can
tell
you
on
the
contrary
let
me
hear
a
little
about
you
aramis
i
have
told
you
my
friend
there
is
nothing
of
aramis
left
in
me
nor
of
the
abbe
d
herblay
even
no
not
even
of
him
you
see
a
man
whom
providence
has
taken
by
the
hand
whom
he
has
conducted
to
a
position
that
he
could
never
have
dared
even
to
hope
for
providence
asked
d
artagnan
yes
well
that
is
strange
i
was
told
it
was
m
fouquet
who
told
you
that
cried
aramis
without
being
able
with
all
the
power
of
his
will
to
prevent
the
color
rising
to
his
cheeks
ma
foi
why
bazin
the
fool
i
do
not
say
he
is
a
man
of
genius
it
is
true
but
he
told
me
so
and
after
him
i
repeat
it
to
you
i
have
never
even
seen
fouquet
replied
aramis
with
a
look
as
pure
and
calm
as
that
of
a
virgin
who
has
never
told
a
lie
well
but
if
you
had
seen
him
and
known
him
there
is
no
harm
in
that
replied
d
artagnan
fouquet
is
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
humph
a
great
politician
aramis
made
a
gesture
of
indifference
an
minister
i
only
hold
to
the
king
and
the
pope
dame
listen
then
said
d
artagnan
in
the
most
natural
tone
imaginable
i
said
that
because
everybody
here
swears
by
fouquet
the
plain
is
fouquet
s
the
i
am
about
to
buy
are
fouquet
s
the
island
in
which
porthos
studies
topography
is
fouquet
s
the
garrison
is
fouquet
s
the
galleys
are
fouquet
s
i
confess
then
that
nothing
would
have
surprised
me
in
your
enfeoffment
or
rather
in
that
of
your
diocese
to
fouquet
he
is
a
different
master
from
the
king
that
is
all
but
quite
as
powerful
as
louis
thank
god
i
am
not
vassal
to
anybody
i
belong
to
nobody
and
am
entirely
my
own
master
replied
aramis
who
during
this
conversation
followed
with
his
eye
every
gesture
of
d
artagnan
every
glance
of
porthos
but
d
artagnan
was
impassible
and
porthos
motionless
the
thrusts
aimed
so
skillfully
were
parried
by
an
able
adversary
not
one
hit
the
mark
nevertheless
both
began
to
feel
the
fatigue
of
such
a
contest
and
the
announcement
of
supper
was
well
received
by
everybody
supper
changed
the
course
of
conversation
besides
they
felt
that
upon
their
guard
as
each
one
had
been
they
could
neither
of
them
boast
of
having
the
advantage
porthos
had
understood
nothing
of
what
had
been
meant
he
had
held
himself
motionless
because
aramis
had
made
him
a
sign
not
to
stir
supper
for
him
was
nothing
but
supper
but
that
was
quite
enough
for
porthos
the
supper
then
went
off
very
well
d
artagnan
was
in
high
spirits
aramis
exceeded
himself
in
kind
affability
porthos
ate
like
old
pelops
their
talk
was
of
war
finance
the
arts
and
love
aramis
played
astonishment
at
every
word
of
politics
d
artagnan
risked
this
long
series
of
surprises
increased
the
mistrust
of
d
artagnan
as
the
eternal
indifference
of
d
artagnan
provoked
the
suspicions
of
aramis
at
length
d
artagnan
designedly
uttered
the
name
of
colbert
he
had
reserved
that
stroke
for
the
last
who
is
this
colbert
asked
the
bishop
oh
come
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
that
is
too
strong
we
must
be
careful
mordioux
we
must
be
careful
and
he
then
gave
aramis
all
the
information
respecting
colbert
he
could
desire
the
supper
or
rather
the
conversation
was
prolonged
till
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
between
d
artagnan
and
aramis
at
ten
o
clock
precisely
porthos
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
chair
and
snored
like
an
organ
at
midnight
he
woke
up
and
they
sent
him
to
bed
hum
said
he
i
was
near
falling
asleep
but
that
was
all
very
interesting
you
were
talking
about
at
one
o
clock
aramis
conducted
d
artagnan
to
the
chamber
destined
for
him
which
was
the
best
in
the
episcopal
residence
two
servants
were
placed
at
his
command
at
eight
o
clock
said
he
taking
leave
of
d
artagnan
we
will
take
if
agreeable
to
you
a
ride
on
horseback
with
porthos
at
eight
o
clock
said
d
artagnan
so
late
you
know
that
i
require
seven
hours
sleep
said
aramis
that
is
true
dear
friend
and
he
embraced
the
musketeer
cordially
d
artagnan
allowed
him
to
depart
then
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
good
cried
he
at
five
o
clock
i
will
be
on
foot
this
determination
being
made
he
went
to
bed
and
quietly
put
two
and
two
together
as
people
say
chapter
lxxiii
in
which
porthos
begins
to
be
sorry
for
having
come
with
d
artagnan
scarcely
had
d
artagnan
extinguished
his
taper
when
aramis
who
had
watched
through
his
curtains
the
last
glimmer
of
light
in
his
friend
s
apartment
traversed
the
corridor
on
tiptoe
and
went
to
porthos
s
room
the
giant
who
had
been
in
bed
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
lay
grandly
stretched
out
on
the
down
bed
he
was
in
that
happy
calm
of
the
first
sleep
which
with
porthos
resisted
the
noise
of
bells
or
the
report
of
cannon
his
head
swam
in
that
soft
oscillation
which
reminds
us
of
the
soothing
movement
of
a
ship
in
a
moment
porthos
would
have
begun
to
dream
the
door
of
the
chamber
opened
softly
under
the
delicate
pressure
of
the
hand
of
aramis
the
bishop
approached
the
sleeper
a
thick
carpet
deadened
his
steps
besides
which
porthos
snored
in
a
manner
to
drown
all
noise
he
laid
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
rouse
said
he
wake
up
my
dear
porthos
the
voice
of
aramis
was
soft
and
kind
but
it
conveyed
more
than
a
notice
it
conveyed
an
order
his
hand
was
light
but
it
indicated
danger
porthos
heard
the
voice
and
felt
the
hand
of
aramis
even
in
the
depth
of
sleep
he
started
up
who
goes
there
cried
he
in
his
giant
s
voice
hush
hush
it
is
i
said
aramis
you
my
friend
and
what
the
devil
do
you
wake
me
for
to
tell
you
that
you
must
set
off
directly
set
off
yes
where
for
for
paris
porthos
bounded
up
in
his
bed
and
then
sank
back
down
again
fixing
his
great
eyes
in
agitation
upon
aramis
for
paris
yes
a
hundred
leagues
said
he
a
hundred
and
four
replied
the
bishop
oh
mon
dieu
sighed
porthos
lying
down
again
like
children
who
contend
with
their
bonne
to
gain
an
hour
or
two
more
sleep
thirty
hours
riding
said
aramis
firmly
you
know
there
are
good
relays
porthos
pushed
out
one
leg
allowing
a
groan
to
escape
him
come
come
my
friend
insisted
the
prelate
with
a
sort
of
impatience
porthos
drew
the
other
leg
out
of
the
bed
and
is
it
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
go
at
once
urgently
necessary
porthos
got
upon
his
feet
and
began
to
shake
both
walls
and
floors
with
his
steps
of
a
marble
statue
hush
hush
for
the
love
of
heaven
my
dear
porthos
said
aramis
you
will
wake
somebody
ah
that
s
true
replied
porthos
in
a
voice
of
thunder
i
forgot
that
but
be
satisfied
i
am
on
guard
and
so
saying
he
let
fall
a
belt
loaded
with
his
sword
and
pistols
and
a
purse
from
which
the
crowns
escaped
with
a
vibrating
and
prolonged
noise
this
noise
made
the
blood
of
aramis
boil
whilst
it
drew
from
porthos
a
formidable
burst
of
laughter
how
droll
that
is
said
he
in
the
same
voice
not
so
loud
porthos
not
so
loud
true
true
and
he
lowered
his
voice
a
i
was
going
to
say
continued
porthos
that
it
is
droll
that
we
are
never
so
slow
as
when
we
are
in
a
hurry
and
never
make
so
much
noise
as
when
we
wish
to
be
silent
yes
that
is
true
but
let
us
give
the
proverb
the
lie
porthos
let
us
make
haste
and
hold
our
tongue
you
see
i
am
doing
my
best
said
porthos
putting
on
his
haut
de
chausses
very
well
this
is
something
in
haste
it
is
more
than
that
it
is
serious
porthos
oh
oh
d
artagnan
has
questioned
you
has
he
not
questioned
me
yes
at
not
the
least
in
the
world
are
you
sure
of
that
porthos
parbleu
it
is
impossible
recollect
yourself
he
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
and
i
told
him
studying
topography
i
would
have
made
use
of
another
word
which
you
employed
one
day
castrametation
yes
that
s
it
but
i
never
could
recollect
it
all
the
better
what
more
did
he
ask
you
who
getard
was
next
who
jupenet
was
he
did
not
happen
to
see
our
plan
of
fortifications
did
he
yes
the
devil
he
did
but
don
t
be
alarmed
i
had
rubbed
out
your
writing
with
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
suppose
you
had
given
me
any
advice
in
those
works
ay
but
our
friend
has
phenomenally
keen
eyes
what
are
you
afraid
of
i
fear
that
everything
is
discovered
porthos
the
matter
is
then
to
prevent
a
great
misfortune
i
have
given
orders
to
my
people
to
close
all
the
gates
and
doors
d
artagnan
will
not
be
able
to
get
out
before
daybreak
your
horse
is
ready
saddled
you
will
gain
the
first
relay
by
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
you
will
have
traversed
fifteen
leagues
come
aramis
then
assisted
porthos
to
dress
piece
by
piece
with
as
much
celerity
as
the
most
skillful
valet
de
chambre
could
have
done
porthos
half
stupefied
let
him
do
as
he
liked
and
confounded
himself
in
excuses
when
he
was
ready
aramis
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
making
him
place
his
foot
with
precaution
on
every
step
of
the
stairs
preventing
him
running
against
turning
him
this
way
and
that
as
if
aramis
had
been
the
giant
and
porthos
the
dwarf
soul
set
fire
to
and
animated
matter
a
horse
was
waiting
ready
saddled
in
the
courtyard
porthos
mounted
then
aramis
himself
took
the
horse
by
the
bridle
and
led
him
over
some
dung
spread
in
the
yard
with
the
evident
intention
of
suppressing
noise
he
at
the
same
time
held
tight
the
horse
s
nose
to
prevent
him
neighing
when
arrived
at
the
outward
gate
drawing
porthos
towards
him
who
was
going
off
without
even
asking
him
what
for
now
friend
porthos
now
without
drawing
bridle
till
you
get
to
paris
whispered
he
in
his
ears
eat
on
horseback
drink
on
horseback
but
lose
not
a
minute
that
s
enough
i
will
not
stop
this
letter
to
fouquet
cost
what
it
may
he
must
have
it
before
he
shall
and
do
not
forget
one
thing
my
friend
what
is
that
that
you
are
riding
out
on
a
hunt
for
your
brevet
of
duc
and
peer
oh
oh
said
porthos
with
his
eyes
sparkling
i
will
do
it
in
hours
in
that
case
try
then
let
go
the
bridle
and
forward
goliath
aramis
did
let
go
not
the
bridle
but
the
horse
s
nose
porthos
released
his
hand
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
which
set
off
at
a
gallop
as
long
as
he
could
distinguish
porthos
through
the
darkness
aramis
followed
him
with
his
eyes
when
he
was
completely
out
of
sight
he
the
yard
nothing
had
stirred
in
d
artagnan
s
apartment
the
valet
placed
on
watch
at
the
door
had
neither
seen
any
light
nor
heard
any
noise
aramis
closed
his
door
carefully
sent
the
lackey
to
bed
and
quickly
sought
his
own
d
artagnan
really
suspected
nothing
therefore
thought
he
had
gained
everything
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
about
four
he
ran
to
the
window
in
his
shirt
the
window
looked
out
upon
the
court
day
was
dawning
the
court
was
deserted
the
fowls
even
had
not
left
their
roosts
not
a
servant
appeared
every
door
was
closed
good
all
is
still
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
never
mind
i
am
up
first
in
the
house
let
us
dress
that
will
be
so
much
done
and
d
artagnan
dressed
himself
but
this
time
he
endeavored
not
to
give
to
the
costume
of
agnan
that
bourgeoise
and
almost
ecclesiastical
rigidity
he
had
affected
before
he
managed
by
drawing
his
belt
tighter
by
buttoning
his
clothes
in
a
different
fashion
and
by
putting
on
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
to
restore
to
his
person
a
little
of
that
military
character
the
absence
of
which
had
surprised
aramis
this
being
done
he
made
free
or
affected
to
make
free
with
his
host
and
entered
his
chamber
without
ceremony
aramis
was
asleep
or
feigned
to
be
so
a
large
book
lay
open
upon
his
a
was
still
burning
in
its
silver
sconce
this
was
more
than
enough
to
prove
to
d
artagnan
the
quiescence
of
the
prelate
s
night
and
the
good
intentions
of
his
waking
the
musketeer
did
to
the
bishop
precisely
as
the
bishop
had
done
to
porthos
he
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
evidently
aramis
pretended
to
sleep
for
instead
of
waking
suddenly
he
who
slept
so
lightly
required
a
repetition
of
the
summons
ah
ah
is
that
you
said
he
stretching
his
arms
what
an
agreeable
surprise
ma
foi
sleep
had
made
me
forget
i
had
the
happiness
to
possess
you
what
o
clock
is
it
i
do
not
know
said
d
artagnan
a
little
embarrassed
early
i
believe
but
you
know
that
devil
of
a
habit
of
waking
with
the
day
sticks
to
me
still
do
you
wish
that
we
should
go
out
so
soon
asked
aramis
it
appears
to
me
to
be
very
early
just
as
you
like
i
thought
we
had
agreed
not
to
get
on
horseback
before
eight
possibly
but
i
had
so
great
a
wish
to
see
you
that
i
said
to
myself
the
sooner
the
better
and
my
seven
hours
sleep
said
aramis
take
care
i
had
reckoned
upon
them
and
what
i
lose
of
them
i
must
make
up
but
it
seems
to
me
that
formerly
you
were
less
of
a
sleeper
than
that
dear
friend
your
blood
was
alive
and
you
were
never
to
be
found
in
bed
and
it
is
exactly
on
account
of
what
you
tell
me
that
i
am
so
fond
of
being
there
now
then
you
confess
that
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
sleeping
that
you
have
put
me
off
till
eight
o
clock
i
have
been
afraid
you
would
laugh
at
me
if
i
told
you
the
truth
tell
me
notwithstanding
well
from
six
to
eight
i
am
accustomed
to
perform
my
devotions
your
devotions
yes
i
did
not
believe
a
bishop
s
exercises
were
so
severe
a
bishop
my
friend
must
sacrifice
more
to
appearance
than
a
simple
cleric
mordioux
aramis
that
is
a
word
which
reconciles
me
with
your
greatness
to
appearances
that
is
a
musketeer
s
word
in
good
truth
vivent
les
apparences
aramis
instead
of
felicitating
me
upon
it
pardon
me
d
artagnan
it
is
a
very
mundane
word
which
i
had
allowed
to
escape
me
must
i
leave
you
then
i
want
time
to
collect
my
thoughts
my
friend
and
for
my
usual
prayers
well
i
leave
you
to
them
but
on
account
of
that
poor
pagan
d
artagnan
abridge
them
for
once
i
beg
i
thirst
for
speech
with
you
well
d
artagnan
i
promise
you
that
within
an
hour
and
a
half
an
hour
and
a
half
of
devotions
ah
my
friend
be
as
reasonable
with
me
as
you
can
let
me
have
the
best
bargain
possible
aramis
began
to
laugh
still
agreeable
still
young
still
gay
said
he
you
have
come
into
my
diocese
to
set
me
quarreling
with
grace
bah
and
you
know
well
that
i
was
never
able
to
resist
your
seductions
you
will
cost
me
my
salvation
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
bit
his
lips
well
said
he
i
will
take
the
sin
on
my
own
head
favor
me
with
one
simple
christian
sign
of
the
cross
favor
me
with
one
prayer
and
we
will
part
hush
said
aramis
we
are
already
no
longer
alone
i
hear
strangers
coming
up
well
dismiss
them
impossible
i
made
an
appointment
with
them
yesterday
it
is
the
principal
of
the
college
of
the
jesuits
and
the
superior
of
the
dominicans
your
staff
well
so
be
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
will
go
and
wake
porthos
and
remain
in
his
company
till
you
have
finished
the
conference
aramis
did
not
stir
his
brow
remained
unbent
he
betrayed
himself
by
no
gesture
or
word
go
said
he
as
d
artagnan
advanced
to
the
door
a
propos
do
you
know
where
porthos
sleeps
no
but
i
will
inquire
take
the
corridor
and
open
the
second
door
on
the
left
thank
you
au
revoir
and
d
artagnan
departed
in
the
direction
pointed
out
by
aramis
ten
minutes
had
not
passed
away
when
he
came
back
he
found
aramis
seated
between
the
superior
of
the
dominicans
and
the
principal
of
the
college
of
the
jesuits
exactly
in
the
same
situation
as
he
had
found
him
formerly
in
the
auberge
at
crevecoeur
this
company
did
not
at
all
terrify
the
musketeer
what
is
it
said
aramis
quietly
you
have
apparently
something
to
say
to
me
my
friend
it
is
replied
d
artagnan
fixing
his
eyes
upon
aramis
it
is
that
porthos
is
not
in
his
apartment
indeed
said
aramis
calmly
are
you
sure
pardieu
i
came
from
his
chamber
where
can
he
be
then
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you
and
have
you
not
inquired
yes
i
have
and
what
answer
did
you
get
that
porthos
often
walking
out
in
a
morning
without
saying
anything
had
probably
gone
out
what
did
you
do
then
i
went
to
the
stables
replied
d
artagnan
carelessly
what
to
do
to
see
if
porthos
had
departed
on
horseback
and
interrogated
the
bishop
well
there
is
a
horse
missing
stall
no
goliath
all
this
dialogue
it
may
be
easily
understood
was
not
exempt
from
a
certain
affectation
on
the
part
of
the
musketeer
and
a
perfect
complaisance
on
the
part
of
aramis
oh
i
guess
how
it
is
said
aramis
after
having
considered
for
a
moment
porthos
is
gone
out
to
give
us
a
surprise
a
surprise
yes
the
canal
which
goes
from
vannes
to
the
sea
abounds
in
teal
and
snipes
that
is
porthos
s
favorite
sport
and
he
will
bring
us
back
a
dozen
for
breakfast
do
you
think
so
said
d
artagnan
i
am
sure
of
it
where
else
can
he
be
i
would
lay
a
wager
he
took
a
gun
with
him
well
that
is
possible
said
d
artagnan
do
one
thing
my
friend
get
on
horseback
and
join
him
you
are
right
said
d
artagnan
i
will
shall
i
go
with
you
no
thank
you
porthos
is
a
rather
remarkable
man
i
will
inquire
as
i
go
along
will
you
take
an
arquebus
thank
you
order
what
horse
you
like
to
be
saddled
the
one
i
rode
yesterday
on
coming
from
so
be
it
use
the
horse
as
your
own
aramis
rang
and
gave
orders
to
have
the
horse
d
artagnan
had
chosen
saddled
d
artagnan
followed
the
servant
charged
with
the
execution
of
this
order
when
arrived
at
the
door
the
servant
drew
on
one
side
to
allow
d
artagnan
to
pass
and
at
that
moment
he
caught
the
eye
of
his
master
a
knitting
of
the
brow
gave
the
intelligent
spy
to
understand
that
all
should
be
given
to
d
artagnan
he
wished
d
artagnan
got
into
the
saddle
and
aramis
heard
the
steps
of
his
horse
on
the
pavement
an
instant
after
the
servant
returned
well
asked
the
bishop
monseigneur
he
has
followed
the
course
of
the
canal
and
is
going
towards
the
sea
said
the
servant
very
well
said
aramis
in
fact
d
artagnan
dismissing
all
suspicion
hastened
towards
the
ocean
constantly
hoping
to
see
in
the
landes
or
on
the
beach
the
colossal
profile
of
porthos
he
persisted
in
fancying
he
could
trace
a
horse
s
steps
in
every
puddle
sometimes
he
imagined
he
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
this
illusion
lasted
three
hours
during
two
of
which
he
went
forward
in
search
of
his
friend
in
the
last
he
returned
to
the
house
we
must
have
crossed
said
he
and
i
shall
find
them
waiting
for
me
at
table
d
artagnan
was
mistaken
he
no
more
found
porthos
at
the
palace
than
he
had
found
him
on
the
aramis
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
looking
very
much
concerned
did
my
people
not
find
you
my
dear
d
artagnan
cried
he
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
musketeer
no
did
you
send
any
one
after
me
i
am
deeply
concerned
my
friend
deeply
to
have
induced
you
to
make
such
a
useless
search
but
about
seven
o
clock
the
almoner
of
came
here
he
had
met
du
vallon
who
was
going
away
and
who
being
unwilling
to
disturb
anybody
at
the
palace
had
charged
him
to
tell
me
that
fearing
getard
would
play
him
some
ill
turn
in
his
absence
he
was
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
morning
tide
to
make
a
tour
of
but
tell
me
goliath
has
not
crossed
the
four
leagues
of
sea
i
should
think
there
are
full
six
said
aramis
that
makes
it
less
probable
still
therefore
my
friend
said
aramis
with
one
of
his
blandest
smiles
goliath
is
in
the
stable
well
pleased
i
will
answer
for
it
that
porthos
is
no
longer
on
his
back
in
fact
the
horse
had
been
brought
back
from
the
relay
by
the
direction
of
the
prelate
from
whom
no
detail
escaped
d
artagnan
appeared
as
well
satisfied
with
as
possible
with
the
explanation
he
entered
upon
a
part
of
dissimulation
which
agreed
perfectly
with
the
suspicions
that
arose
more
strongly
in
his
mind
he
breakfasted
between
the
jesuit
and
aramis
having
the
dominican
in
front
of
him
and
smiling
particularly
at
the
dominican
whose
jolly
fat
face
pleased
him
much
the
repast
was
long
and
sumptuous
excellent
spanish
wine
fine
morbihan
oysters
exquisite
fish
from
the
mouth
of
the
loire
enormous
prawns
from
paimboeuf
and
delicious
game
from
the
moors
constituted
the
principal
part
of
it
d
artagnan
ate
much
and
drank
but
little
aramis
drank
nothing
unless
it
was
water
after
the
repast
you
offered
me
an
arquebus
said
d
artagnan
i
did
lend
it
me
then
are
you
going
shooting
whilst
waiting
for
porthos
it
is
the
best
thing
i
can
do
i
think
take
which
you
like
from
the
trophy
will
you
not
come
with
me
i
would
with
great
pleasure
but
alas
my
friend
sporting
is
forbidden
to
bishops
ah
said
d
artagnan
i
did
not
know
that
besides
continued
aramis
i
shall
be
busy
till
i
shall
go
alone
then
said
d
artagnan
i
am
sorry
to
say
you
must
but
come
back
to
dinner
pardieu
the
eating
at
your
house
is
too
good
to
make
me
think
of
not
coming
back
and
thereupon
d
artagnan
quitted
his
host
bowed
to
the
guests
and
took
his
arquebus
but
instead
of
shooting
went
straight
to
the
little
port
of
vannes
he
looked
in
vain
to
observe
if
anybody
saw
him
he
could
discern
neither
thing
nor
person
he
engaged
a
little
fishing
boat
for
livres
and
set
off
at
eleven
convinced
that
he
had
not
been
followed
and
that
was
true
he
had
not
been
followed
only
a
jesuit
brother
placed
in
the
top
of
the
steeple
of
his
church
had
not
since
the
morning
by
the
help
of
an
excellent
glass
lost
sight
of
one
of
his
steps
at
three
quarters
past
eleven
aramis
was
informed
that
d
artagnan
was
sailing
towards
the
voyage
was
rapid
a
good
north
wind
drove
him
towards
the
isle
as
he
approached
his
eyes
were
constantly
fixed
upon
the
coast
he
looked
to
see
if
upon
the
shore
or
upon
the
fortifications
the
brilliant
dress
and
vast
stature
of
porthos
should
stand
out
against
a
slightly
clouded
sky
but
his
search
was
in
vain
he
landed
without
having
seen
anything
and
learnt
from
the
first
soldier
interrogated
by
him
that
du
vallon
had
not
yet
returned
from
vannes
then
without
losing
an
instant
d
artagnan
ordered
his
little
bark
to
put
its
head
towards
sarzeau
we
know
that
the
wind
changes
with
the
different
hours
of
the
day
the
breeze
had
veered
from
the
north
to
the
the
wind
then
was
almost
as
good
for
the
return
to
sarzeau
as
it
had
been
for
the
voyage
to
in
three
hours
d
artagnan
had
touched
the
continent
two
hours
more
sufficed
for
his
ride
to
vannes
in
spite
of
the
rapidity
of
his
passage
what
d
artagnan
endured
of
impatience
and
anger
during
that
short
passage
the
deck
alone
of
the
vessel
upon
which
he
stamped
backwards
and
forwards
for
three
hours
could
testify
he
made
but
one
bound
from
the
quay
whereon
he
landed
to
the
episcopal
palace
he
thought
to
terrify
aramis
by
the
promptitude
of
his
return
he
wished
to
reproach
him
with
his
duplicity
and
yet
with
reserve
but
with
sufficient
spirit
nevertheless
to
make
him
feel
all
the
consequences
of
it
and
force
from
him
a
part
of
his
secret
he
hoped
in
short
thanks
to
that
heat
of
expression
which
is
to
secrets
what
the
charge
with
the
bayonet
is
to
redoubts
to
bring
the
mysterious
aramis
to
some
manifestation
or
other
but
he
found
in
the
vestibule
of
the
palace
the
valet
de
chambre
who
closed
his
passage
while
smiling
upon
him
with
a
stupid
air
monseigneur
cried
d
artagnan
endeavoring
to
put
him
aside
with
his
hand
moved
for
an
instant
the
valet
resumed
his
station
monseigneur
said
he
yes
to
be
sure
do
you
not
know
me
imbecile
yes
you
are
the
chevalier
d
artagnan
then
let
me
pass
it
is
of
no
use
why
of
no
use
because
his
greatness
is
not
at
home
what
his
greatness
is
not
at
home
where
is
he
then
gone
gone
yes
whither
i
don
t
know
but
perhaps
he
tells
monsieur
le
chevalier
and
how
where
in
what
fashion
in
this
letter
which
he
gave
me
for
monsieur
le
chevalier
and
the
valet
de
chambre
drew
a
letter
form
his
pocket
give
it
me
then
you
rascal
said
d
artagnan
snatching
it
from
his
hand
oh
yes
continued
he
at
the
first
line
yes
i
understand
and
he
read
dear
friend
an
affair
of
the
most
urgent
nature
calls
me
to
a
distant
parish
of
my
diocese
i
hoped
to
see
you
again
before
i
set
out
but
i
lose
that
hope
in
thinking
that
you
are
going
no
doubt
to
remain
two
or
three
days
at
with
our
dear
porthos
amuse
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
but
do
not
attempt
to
hold
out
against
him
at
table
this
is
a
counsel
i
might
have
given
even
to
athos
in
his
most
brilliant
and
best
days
adieu
dear
friend
believe
that
i
regret
greatly
not
having
better
and
for
a
longer
time
profited
by
your
excellent
company
mordioux
cried
d
artagnan
i
am
tricked
ah
blockhead
brute
triple
fool
that
i
am
but
those
laugh
best
who
laugh
last
oh
duped
duped
like
a
monkey
cheated
with
an
empty
nutshell
and
with
a
hearty
blow
bestowed
upon
the
nose
of
the
smirking
valet
de
chambre
he
made
all
haste
out
of
the
episcopal
palace
furet
however
good
a
trotter
was
not
equal
to
present
circumstances
d
artagnan
therefore
took
the
post
and
chose
a
horse
which
he
soon
caused
to
demonstrate
with
good
spurs
and
a
light
hand
that
deer
are
not
the
swiftest
animals
in
nature
chapter
lxxiv
d
artagnan
makes
all
speed
porthos
snores
and
aramis
counsels
from
thirty
to
hours
after
the
events
we
have
just
related
as
fouquet
according
to
his
custom
having
interdicted
his
door
was
working
in
the
cabinet
of
his
house
at
with
which
we
are
already
acquainted
a
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
steaming
with
sweat
entered
the
court
at
full
gallop
this
carriage
was
probably
expected
for
three
or
four
lackeys
hastened
to
the
door
which
they
opened
whilst
fouquet
rose
from
his
bureau
and
ran
to
the
window
a
man
got
painfully
out
of
the
carriage
descending
with
difficulty
the
three
steps
of
the
door
leaning
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
lackeys
he
had
scarcely
uttered
his
name
when
the
valet
upon
whom
he
was
not
leaning
sprang
up
to
the
perron
and
disappeared
in
the
vestibule
this
man
went
to
inform
his
master
but
he
had
no
occasion
to
knock
at
the
door
fouquet
was
standing
on
the
threshold
monseigneur
the
bishop
of
vannes
said
he
very
well
replied
his
master
then
leaning
over
the
banister
of
the
staircase
of
which
aramis
was
beginning
to
ascend
the
first
steps
ah
dear
friend
said
he
you
so
soon
yes
i
myself
monsieur
but
bruised
battered
as
you
see
oh
my
poor
friend
said
fouquet
presenting
him
his
arm
on
which
aramis
leant
whilst
the
servants
drew
back
respectfully
bah
replied
aramis
it
is
nothing
since
i
am
here
the
principal
thing
was
that
i
should
get
here
and
here
i
am
speak
quickly
said
fouquet
closing
the
door
of
the
cabinet
behind
aramis
and
himself
are
we
alone
yes
perfectly
no
one
observes
us
no
one
can
hear
us
be
satisfied
nobody
is
du
vallon
arrived
yes
and
you
have
received
my
letter
yes
the
affair
is
serious
apparently
since
it
necessitates
your
attendance
in
paris
at
a
moment
when
your
presence
was
so
urgent
elsewhere
you
are
right
it
could
not
be
more
serious
thank
you
thank
you
what
is
it
about
but
for
god
s
sake
before
anything
else
take
time
to
breathe
dear
friend
you
are
so
pale
you
frighten
me
i
am
really
in
great
pain
but
for
heaven
s
sake
think
nothing
about
me
did
du
vallon
tell
you
nothing
when
he
delivered
the
letter
to
you
no
i
heard
a
great
noise
i
went
to
the
window
i
saw
at
the
foot
of
the
perron
a
sort
of
horseman
of
marble
i
went
down
he
held
the
letter
out
to
me
and
his
horse
fell
down
dead
but
he
he
fell
with
the
horse
he
was
lifted
and
carried
to
an
apartment
having
read
the
letter
i
went
up
to
him
in
hopes
of
obtaining
more
ample
information
but
he
was
asleep
and
after
such
a
fashion
that
it
was
impossible
to
wake
him
i
took
pity
on
him
i
gave
orders
that
his
boots
should
be
cut
from
off
his
legs
and
that
he
should
be
left
quite
undisturbed
so
far
well
now
this
is
the
question
in
hand
monseigneur
you
have
seen
d
artagnan
in
paris
have
you
not
certes
and
think
him
a
man
of
intelligence
and
even
a
man
of
heart
although
he
did
bring
about
the
death
of
our
dear
friends
lyodot
and
d
eymeris
alas
yes
i
heard
of
that
at
tours
i
met
the
courier
who
was
bringing
the
letter
from
gourville
and
the
dispatches
from
pelisson
have
you
seriously
reflected
on
that
event
monsieur
yes
and
in
it
you
perceived
a
direct
attack
upon
your
sovereignty
and
do
you
believe
it
to
be
so
oh
yes
i
think
so
well
i
must
confess
that
sad
idea
occurred
to
me
likewise
do
not
blind
yourself
monsieur
in
the
name
of
heaven
listen
attentively
to
me
i
return
to
d
artagnan
i
am
all
attention
under
what
circumstances
did
you
see
him
he
came
here
for
money
with
what
kind
of
order
with
an
order
from
the
king
direct
signed
by
his
majesty
there
then
well
d
artagnan
has
been
to
he
was
disguised
he
came
in
the
character
of
some
sort
of
an
intendant
charged
by
his
master
to
purchase
now
d
artagnan
has
no
other
master
but
the
king
he
came
then
sent
by
the
king
he
saw
porthos
who
is
porthos
i
beg
your
pardon
i
made
a
mistake
he
saw
du
vallon
at
and
he
knows
as
well
as
you
and
i
do
that
is
fortified
and
you
think
that
the
king
sent
him
there
said
fouquet
pensively
i
certainly
do
and
d
artagnan
in
the
hands
of
the
king
is
a
dangerous
instrument
the
most
dangerous
imaginable
then
i
formed
a
correct
opinion
of
him
at
the
first
glance
how
so
i
wished
to
attach
him
to
myself
if
you
judged
him
to
be
the
bravest
the
most
acute
and
the
most
adroit
man
in
france
you
judged
correctly
he
must
be
had
then
at
any
price
d
artagnan
is
that
not
your
opinion
it
may
be
my
opinion
but
you
will
never
get
him
why
because
we
have
allowed
the
time
to
go
by
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
court
we
should
have
profited
by
that
since
that
he
has
passed
into
england
there
he
powerfully
assisted
in
the
restoration
there
he
gained
a
fortune
and
after
all
he
returned
to
the
service
of
the
king
well
if
he
has
returned
to
the
service
of
the
king
it
is
because
he
is
well
paid
in
that
service
we
will
pay
him
even
better
that
is
all
oh
monsieur
excuse
me
d
artagnan
has
a
high
respect
for
his
word
and
where
that
is
once
engaged
he
keeps
it
what
do
you
conclude
then
said
fouquet
with
great
inquietude
at
present
the
principal
thing
is
to
parry
a
dangerous
blow
and
how
is
it
to
be
parried
listen
but
d
artagnan
will
come
and
render
an
account
to
the
king
of
his
mission
oh
we
have
time
enough
to
think
about
that
how
so
you
are
much
in
advance
of
him
i
presume
nearly
ten
hours
well
in
ten
hours
aramis
shook
his
pale
head
look
at
these
clouds
which
flit
across
the
heavens
at
these
swallows
which
cut
the
air
d
artagnan
moves
more
quickly
than
the
clouds
or
the
birds
d
artagnan
is
the
wind
which
carries
them
a
strange
man
i
tell
you
he
is
superhuman
monsieur
he
is
of
my
own
age
and
i
have
known
him
these
years
well
well
listen
to
my
calculation
monsieur
i
send
du
vallon
off
to
you
two
hours
after
midnight
du
vallon
was
eight
hours
in
advance
of
me
when
did
du
vallon
arrive
about
four
hours
ago
you
see
then
that
i
gained
four
upon
him
and
yet
porthos
is
a
staunch
horseman
and
he
has
left
on
the
road
eight
dead
horses
whose
bodies
i
came
to
successively
i
rode
post
fifty
leagues
but
i
have
the
gout
the
gravel
and
what
else
i
know
not
so
that
fatigue
kills
me
i
was
obliged
to
dismount
at
tours
since
that
rolling
along
in
a
carriage
half
dead
sometimes
overturned
drawn
upon
the
sides
and
sometimes
on
the
back
of
the
carriage
always
with
four
spirited
horses
at
full
gallop
i
have
arrived
arrived
gaining
four
hours
upon
porthos
but
see
you
d
artagnan
does
not
weigh
three
as
porthos
does
d
artagnan
has
not
the
gout
and
gravel
as
i
have
he
is
not
a
horseman
he
is
a
centaur
d
artagnan
look
you
set
out
for
when
i
set
out
for
paris
and
d
artagnan
notwithstanding
my
ten
hours
advance
d
artagnan
will
arrive
within
two
hours
after
me
but
then
accidents
he
never
meets
with
accidents
horses
may
fail
him
he
will
run
as
fast
as
a
horse
good
god
what
a
man
yes
he
is
a
man
whom
i
love
and
admire
i
love
him
because
he
is
good
great
and
loyal
i
admire
him
because
he
represents
in
my
eyes
the
culminating
point
of
human
power
but
whilst
loving
and
admiring
him
i
fear
him
and
am
on
my
guard
against
him
now
then
i
resume
monsieur
in
two
hours
d
artagnan
will
be
here
be
beforehand
with
him
go
to
the
louvre
and
see
the
king
before
he
sees
d
artagnan
what
shall
i
say
to
the
king
nothing
give
him
oh
monsieur
d
herblay
monsieur
d
herblay
cried
fouquet
what
projects
crushed
all
at
once
after
one
project
that
has
failed
there
is
always
another
project
that
may
lead
to
fortune
we
should
never
despair
go
monsieur
and
go
at
once
but
that
garrison
so
carefully
chosen
the
king
will
change
it
directly
that
garrison
monsieur
was
the
king
s
when
it
entered
it
is
yours
now
it
is
the
same
with
all
garrisons
after
a
fortnight
s
occupation
let
things
go
on
monsieur
do
you
see
any
inconvenience
in
having
an
army
at
the
end
of
a
year
instead
of
two
regiments
do
you
not
see
that
your
garrison
of
will
make
you
partisans
at
la
rochelle
nantes
bordeaux
toulouse
in
short
wherever
they
may
be
sent
to
go
to
the
king
monsieur
go
time
flies
and
d
artagnan
while
we
are
losing
time
is
flying
like
an
arrow
along
the
monsieur
d
herblay
you
know
that
each
word
from
you
is
a
germ
which
fructifies
in
my
thoughts
i
will
go
to
the
louvre
instantly
will
you
not
i
only
ask
time
to
change
my
dress
remember
that
d
artagnan
has
no
need
to
pass
through
but
will
go
straight
to
the
louvre
that
is
cutting
off
an
hour
from
the
advantage
that
yet
remains
to
us
d
artagnan
may
have
everything
except
my
english
horses
i
shall
be
at
the
louvre
in
minutes
and
without
losing
a
second
fouquet
gave
orders
for
his
departure
aramis
had
only
time
to
say
to
him
return
as
quickly
as
you
go
for
i
shall
await
you
impatiently
five
minutes
after
the
superintendent
was
flying
along
the
road
to
paris
during
this
time
aramis
desired
to
be
shown
the
chamber
in
which
porthos
was
sleeping
at
the
door
of
fouquet
s
cabinet
he
was
folded
in
the
arms
of
pelisson
who
had
just
heard
of
his
arrival
and
had
left
his
office
to
see
him
aramis
received
with
that
friendly
dignity
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
assume
these
caresses
respectful
as
earnest
but
all
at
once
stopping
on
the
what
is
that
i
hear
up
yonder
there
was
in
fact
a
hoarse
growling
kind
of
noise
like
the
roar
of
a
hungry
tiger
or
an
impatient
lion
oh
that
is
nothing
said
pelisson
smiling
well
but
it
is
du
vallon
snoring
ah
true
said
aramis
i
had
forgotten
no
one
but
he
is
capable
of
making
such
a
noise
allow
me
pelisson
to
inquire
if
he
wants
anything
and
you
will
permit
me
to
accompany
you
oh
certainly
and
both
entered
the
chamber
porthos
was
stretched
upon
the
bed
his
face
was
violet
rather
than
red
his
eyes
were
swelled
his
mouth
was
wide
open
the
roaring
which
escaped
from
the
deep
cavities
of
his
chest
made
the
glass
of
the
windows
vibrate
to
those
developed
and
clearly
defined
muscles
starting
from
his
face
to
his
hair
matted
with
sweat
to
the
energetic
heaving
of
his
chin
and
shoulders
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
a
certain
degree
of
admiration
strength
carried
to
this
point
is
the
herculean
legs
and
feet
of
porthos
had
by
swelling
burst
his
stockings
all
the
strength
of
his
huge
body
was
converted
into
the
rigidity
of
stone
porthos
moved
no
more
than
does
the
giant
of
granite
which
reclines
upon
the
plains
of
agrigentum
according
to
pelisson
s
orders
his
boots
had
been
cut
off
for
no
human
power
could
have
pulled
them
off
four
lackeys
had
tried
in
vain
pulling
at
them
as
they
would
have
pulled
capstans
and
yet
all
this
did
not
awaken
him
they
had
hacked
off
his
boots
in
fragments
and
his
legs
had
fallen
back
upon
the
bed
they
then
cut
off
the
rest
of
his
clothes
carried
him
to
a
bath
in
which
they
let
him
soak
a
considerable
time
they
then
put
on
him
clean
linen
and
placed
him
in
a
bed
the
whole
with
efforts
and
pains
which
might
have
roused
a
dead
man
but
which
did
not
make
porthos
open
an
eye
or
interrupt
for
a
second
the
formidable
diapason
of
his
snoring
aramis
wished
on
his
part
with
his
nervous
nature
armed
with
extraordinary
courage
to
outbrave
fatigue
and
employ
himself
with
gourville
and
pelisson
but
he
fainted
in
the
chair
in
which
he
had
persisted
sitting
he
was
carried
into
the
adjoining
room
where
the
repose
of
bed
soon
soothed
his
failing
brain
chapter
lxxv
in
which
monsieur
fouquet
acts
in
the
meantime
fouquet
was
hastening
to
the
louvre
at
the
best
speed
of
his
english
horses
the
king
was
at
work
with
colbert
all
at
once
the
king
became
thoughtful
the
two
sentences
of
death
he
had
signed
on
mounting
his
throne
sometimes
recurred
to
his
memory
they
were
two
black
spots
which
he
saw
with
his
eyes
open
two
spots
of
blood
which
he
saw
when
his
eyes
were
closed
monsieur
said
he
rather
sharply
to
the
intendant
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
that
those
two
men
you
made
me
condemn
were
not
very
great
culprits
sire
they
were
picked
out
from
the
herd
of
the
farmers
of
the
financiers
which
wanted
decimating
picked
out
by
whom
by
necessity
sire
replied
colbert
coldly
necessity
a
great
word
murmured
the
young
king
a
great
goddess
sire
they
were
devoted
friends
of
the
superintendent
were
they
not
yes
sire
friends
who
would
have
given
up
their
lives
for
monsieur
fouquet
they
have
given
them
monsieur
said
the
king
that
is
true
but
uselessly
by
good
luck
which
was
not
their
intention
how
much
money
had
these
men
fraudulently
obtained
ten
millions
perhaps
of
which
six
have
been
confiscated
and
is
that
money
in
my
coffers
said
the
king
with
a
certain
air
of
repugnance
it
is
there
sire
but
this
confiscation
whilst
threatening
fouquet
has
not
touched
him
you
conclude
then
colbert
that
if
fouquet
has
raised
against
your
majesty
a
troop
of
factious
rioters
to
extricate
his
friends
from
punishment
he
will
raise
an
army
when
he
has
in
turn
to
extricate
himself
from
punishment
the
king
darted
at
his
confidant
one
of
those
looks
which
resemble
the
livid
fire
of
a
flash
of
lightning
one
of
those
looks
which
illuminate
the
darkness
of
the
basest
consciences
i
am
astonished
said
he
that
thinking
such
things
of
fouquet
you
did
not
come
to
give
me
your
counsels
thereupon
counsels
upon
what
sire
tell
me
in
the
first
place
clearly
and
precisely
what
you
think
m
colbert
upon
what
subject
sire
upon
the
conduct
of
m
fouquet
i
think
sire
that
fouquet
not
satisfied
with
attracting
all
the
money
to
himself
as
mazarin
did
and
by
that
means
depriving
your
majesty
of
one
part
of
your
power
still
wishes
to
attract
to
himself
all
the
friends
of
easy
life
and
pleasure
of
what
idlers
call
poetry
and
politicians
corruption
i
think
that
by
holding
the
subjects
of
your
majesty
in
pay
he
trespasses
upon
the
royal
prerogative
and
can
not
if
this
continues
so
be
long
in
placing
your
majesty
among
the
weak
and
the
obscure
how
would
you
qualify
all
these
projects
m
colbert
the
projects
of
fouquet
sire
yes
they
are
called
crimes
of
lese
majeste
and
what
is
done
to
criminals
guilty
of
lese
majeste
they
are
arrested
tried
and
punished
you
are
quite
certain
that
fouquet
has
conceived
the
idea
of
the
crime
you
impute
to
him
i
can
say
more
sire
there
is
even
a
commencement
of
the
execution
of
it
well
then
i
return
to
that
which
i
was
saying
m
colbert
and
you
were
saying
sire
give
me
counsel
pardon
me
sire
but
in
the
first
place
i
have
something
to
add
say
what
an
evident
palpable
material
proof
of
treason
and
what
is
that
i
have
just
learnt
that
fouquet
is
fortifying
ah
indeed
yes
sire
are
you
sure
perfectly
do
you
know
sire
what
soldiers
there
are
in
no
ma
foi
do
you
i
am
ignorant
likewise
sire
i
should
therefore
propose
to
your
majesty
to
send
somebody
to
who
me
for
instance
and
what
would
you
do
at
inform
myself
whether
after
the
example
of
the
ancient
feudal
lords
fouquet
was
battlementing
his
walls
and
with
what
purpose
could
he
do
that
with
the
purpose
of
defending
himself
someday
against
his
king
but
if
it
be
thus
colbert
said
louis
we
must
immediately
do
as
you
say
fouquet
must
be
arrested
that
is
impossible
i
thought
i
had
already
told
you
monsieur
that
i
suppressed
that
word
in
my
service
the
service
of
your
majesty
can
not
prevent
fouquet
from
being
well
that
in
consequence
of
holding
that
post
he
has
for
him
all
the
parliament
as
he
has
all
the
army
by
his
largesses
literature
by
his
favors
and
the
noblesse
by
his
presents
that
is
to
say
then
that
i
can
do
nothing
against
m
fouquet
absolutely
nothing
at
least
at
present
sire
you
are
a
sterile
counselor
m
colbert
oh
no
sire
for
i
will
not
confine
myself
to
pointing
out
the
peril
to
your
majesty
come
then
where
shall
we
begin
to
undermine
this
colossus
let
us
see
and
his
majesty
began
to
laugh
bitterly
he
has
grown
great
by
money
kill
him
by
money
sire
if
i
were
to
deprive
him
of
his
charge
a
bad
means
sire
the
good
the
good
then
ruin
him
sire
that
is
the
way
but
how
occasions
will
not
be
wanting
take
advantage
of
all
occasions
point
them
out
to
me
here
is
one
at
once
his
royal
highness
monsieur
is
about
to
be
married
his
nuptials
must
be
magnificent
that
is
a
good
occasion
for
your
majesty
to
demand
a
million
of
fouquet
fouquet
who
pays
twenty
thousand
livres
down
when
he
need
not
pay
more
than
five
thousand
will
easily
find
that
million
when
your
majesty
demands
it
that
is
all
very
well
i
will
demand
it
said
louis
if
your
majesty
will
sign
the
ordonnance
i
will
have
the
money
got
together
myself
and
colbert
pushed
a
paper
before
the
king
and
presented
a
pen
to
him
at
that
moment
the
usher
opened
the
door
and
announced
monsieur
le
surintendant
louis
turned
pale
colbert
let
the
pen
fall
and
drew
back
from
the
king
over
whom
he
extended
his
black
wings
like
an
evil
spirit
the
superintendent
made
his
entrance
like
a
man
of
the
court
to
whom
a
single
glance
was
sufficient
to
make
him
appreciate
the
situation
that
situation
was
not
very
encouraging
for
fouquet
whatever
might
be
his
consciousness
of
strength
the
small
black
eye
of
colbert
dilated
by
envy
and
the
limpid
eye
of
louis
xiv
inflamed
by
anger
signalled
some
pressing
danger
courtiers
are
with
regard
to
court
rumors
like
old
soldiers
who
distinguish
through
the
blasts
of
wind
and
bluster
of
leaves
the
sound
of
the
distant
steps
of
an
armed
troop
they
can
after
having
listened
tell
pretty
nearly
how
many
men
are
marching
how
many
arms
resound
how
many
cannons
roll
fouquet
had
then
only
to
interrogate
the
silence
which
his
arrival
had
produced
he
found
it
big
with
menacing
revelations
the
king
allowed
him
time
enough
to
advance
as
far
as
the
middle
of
the
chamber
his
adolescent
modesty
commanded
this
forbearance
of
the
moment
fouquet
boldly
seized
the
opportunity
sire
said
he
i
was
impatient
to
see
your
majesty
what
for
asked
louis
to
announce
some
good
news
to
you
colbert
minus
grandeur
of
person
less
largeness
of
heart
resembled
fouquet
in
many
points
he
had
the
same
penetration
the
same
knowledge
of
men
moreover
that
great
power
of
which
gives
to
hypocrites
time
to
reflect
and
gather
themselves
up
to
take
a
spring
he
guessed
that
fouquet
was
going
to
meet
the
blow
he
was
about
to
deal
him
his
eyes
glittered
ominously
what
news
asked
the
king
fouquet
placed
a
roll
of
papers
on
the
table
let
your
majesty
have
the
goodness
to
cast
your
eyes
over
this
work
said
he
the
king
slowly
unfolded
the
paper
plans
said
he
yes
sire
and
what
are
these
plans
a
new
fortification
sire
ah
ah
said
the
king
you
amuse
yourself
with
tactics
and
strategies
then
m
fouquet
i
occupy
myself
with
everything
that
may
be
useful
to
the
reign
of
your
majesty
replied
fouquet
beautiful
descriptions
said
the
king
looking
at
the
design
your
majesty
comprehends
without
doubt
said
fouquet
bending
over
the
paper
here
is
the
circle
of
the
walls
here
are
the
forts
there
the
advanced
works
and
what
do
i
see
here
monsieur
the
sea
the
sea
all
round
yes
sire
and
what
is
then
the
name
of
this
place
of
which
you
show
me
the
plan
sire
it
is
replied
fouquet
with
simplicity
at
this
word
at
this
name
colbert
made
so
marked
a
movement
that
the
king
turned
round
to
enforce
the
necessity
for
reserve
fouquet
did
not
appear
to
be
the
least
in
the
world
concerned
by
the
movement
of
colbert
or
the
king
s
signal
monsieur
continued
louis
you
have
then
fortified
yes
sire
and
i
have
brought
the
plan
and
the
accounts
to
your
majesty
replied
fouquet
i
have
expended
sixteen
hundred
livres
in
this
operation
what
to
do
replied
louis
coldly
having
taken
the
initiative
from
a
malicious
look
of
the
intendant
for
an
aim
very
easy
to
seize
replied
fouquet
your
majesty
was
on
cool
terms
with
great
britain
yes
but
since
the
restoration
of
king
charles
ii
i
have
formed
an
alliance
with
him
a
month
since
sire
your
majesty
has
truly
said
but
it
is
more
than
six
months
since
the
fortifications
of
were
begun
then
they
have
become
useless
sire
fortifications
are
never
useless
i
fortified
against
mm
monk
and
lambert
and
all
those
london
citizens
who
were
playing
at
soldiers
will
be
ready
fortified
against
the
dutch
against
whom
either
england
or
your
majesty
can
not
fail
to
make
war
the
king
was
again
silent
and
looked
askant
at
colbert
i
believe
added
louis
is
yours
m
fouquet
no
sire
whose
then
your
majesty
s
colbert
was
seized
with
as
much
terror
as
if
a
gulf
had
opened
beneath
his
feet
louis
started
with
admiration
either
at
the
genius
or
the
devotion
of
fouquet
explain
yourself
monsieur
said
he
nothing
more
easy
sire
is
one
of
my
estates
i
have
fortified
it
at
my
own
expense
but
as
nothing
in
the
world
can
oppose
a
subject
making
an
humble
present
to
his
king
i
offer
your
majesty
the
proprietorship
of
the
estate
of
which
you
will
leave
me
the
usufruct
as
a
place
of
war
ought
to
be
occupied
by
the
king
your
majesty
will
be
able
henceforth
to
keep
a
safe
garrison
there
colbert
felt
almost
sinking
down
upon
the
floor
to
keep
himself
from
falling
he
was
obliged
to
hold
by
the
columns
of
the
wainscoting
this
is
a
piece
of
great
skill
in
the
art
of
war
that
you
have
exhibited
here
monsieur
said
louis
sire
the
initiative
did
not
come
from
me
replied
fouquet
many
officers
have
inspired
me
with
it
the
plans
themselves
have
been
made
by
one
of
the
most
distinguished
engineers
his
name
du
vallon
du
vallon
resumed
louis
i
do
not
know
him
it
is
much
to
be
lamented
colbert
continued
he
that
i
do
not
know
the
names
of
the
men
of
talent
who
do
honor
to
my
reign
and
while
saying
these
words
he
turned
towards
colbert
the
latter
felt
himself
crushed
the
sweat
flowed
from
his
brow
no
word
presented
itself
to
his
lips
he
suffered
an
inexpressible
martyrdom
you
will
recollect
that
name
added
louis
xiv
colbert
bowed
but
was
paler
than
his
ruffles
of
flemish
lace
fouquet
continued
the
masonries
are
of
roman
concrete
the
architects
amalgamated
it
for
me
after
the
best
accounts
of
antiquity
and
the
cannon
asked
louis
oh
sire
that
concerns
your
majesty
it
did
not
become
me
to
place
cannon
in
my
own
house
unless
your
majesty
had
told
me
it
was
yours
louis
began
to
float
undetermined
between
the
hatred
which
this
so
powerful
man
inspired
him
with
and
the
pity
he
felt
for
the
other
so
cast
down
who
seemed
to
him
the
counterfeit
of
the
former
but
the
consciousness
of
his
kingly
duty
prevailed
over
the
feelings
of
the
man
and
he
stretched
out
his
finger
to
the
paper
it
must
have
cost
you
a
great
deal
of
money
to
carry
these
plans
into
execution
said
he
i
believe
i
had
the
honor
of
telling
your
majesty
the
amount
repeat
it
if
you
please
i
have
forgotten
it
sixteen
hundred
thousand
livres
sixteen
hundred
thousand
livres
you
are
enormously
rich
monsieur
it
is
your
majesty
who
is
rich
since
is
yours
yes
thank
you
but
however
rich
i
may
be
fouquet
the
king
stopped
well
sire
asked
the
superintendent
i
foresee
the
moment
when
i
shall
want
money
you
sire
and
at
what
moment
then
for
example
will
your
majesty
do
me
the
honor
to
explain
yourself
my
brother
is
going
to
marry
the
english
princess
well
sire
well
i
ought
to
give
the
bride
a
reception
worthy
of
the
granddaughter
of
henry
iv
that
is
but
just
sire
then
i
shall
want
money
no
doubt
i
shall
want
louis
hesitated
the
sum
he
was
going
to
demand
was
the
same
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
refuse
charles
ii
he
turned
towards
colbert
that
he
might
give
the
blow
i
shall
want
repeated
he
looking
at
colbert
a
million
said
the
latter
bluntly
delighted
to
take
his
revenge
fouquet
turned
his
back
upon
the
intendant
to
listen
to
the
king
he
did
not
turn
round
but
waited
till
the
king
repeated
or
rather
murmured
a
million
oh
sire
replied
fouquet
disdainfully
a
million
what
will
your
majesty
do
with
a
million
it
appears
to
me
nevertheless
said
louis
xiv
that
is
not
more
than
is
spent
at
the
nuptials
of
one
of
the
most
petty
princes
of
germany
monsieur
your
majesty
must
have
two
millions
at
least
the
horses
alone
would
run
away
with
five
hundred
thousand
livres
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
sending
your
majesty
sixteen
hundred
thousand
livres
this
evening
how
said
the
king
sixteen
hundred
thousand
livres
look
sire
replied
fouquet
without
even
turning
towards
colbert
i
know
that
wants
four
hundred
thousand
livres
of
the
two
millions
but
this
monsieur
of
l
intendance
pointing
over
his
shoulder
to
colbert
who
if
possible
became
paler
behind
him
has
in
his
coffers
nine
hundred
thousand
livres
of
mine
the
king
turned
round
to
look
at
colbert
but
said
the
latter
monsieur
continued
fouquet
still
speaking
indirectly
to
colbert
monsieur
has
received
a
week
ago
sixteen
hundred
thousand
livres
he
has
paid
a
hundred
thousand
livres
to
the
guards
thousand
livres
to
the
hospitals
thousand
to
the
swiss
an
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
for
provisions
a
thousand
for
arms
ten
thousand
for
accidental
expenses
i
do
not
err
then
in
reckoning
upon
nine
hundred
thousand
livres
that
are
left
then
turning
towards
colbert
like
a
disdainful
head
of
office
towards
his
inferior
take
care
monsieur
said
he
that
those
nine
hundred
thousand
livres
be
remitted
to
his
majesty
this
evening
in
gold
but
said
the
king
that
will
make
two
millions
five
hundred
thousand
livres
sire
the
five
hundred
thousand
livres
over
will
serve
as
pocket
money
for
his
royal
highness
you
understand
monsieur
colbert
this
evening
before
eight
o
clock
and
with
these
words
bowing
respectfully
to
the
king
the
superintendent
made
his
exit
backwards
without
honoring
with
a
single
look
the
envious
man
whose
head
he
had
just
half
shaved
colbert
tore
his
ruffles
to
pieces
in
his
rage
and
bit
his
lips
till
they
bled
fouquet
had
not
passed
the
door
of
the
cabinet
when
an
usher
pushing
by
him
exclaimed
a
courier
from
bretagne
for
his
majesty
d
herblay
was
right
murmured
fouquet
pulling
out
his
watch
an
hour
and
minutes
it
was
quite
true
end
of
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
