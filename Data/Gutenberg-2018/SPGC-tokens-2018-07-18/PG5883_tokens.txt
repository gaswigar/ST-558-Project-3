preface
from
this
was
one
of
the
first
books
published
about
the
ufo
phenomena
we
are
fortunate
that
it
ended
up
in
the
public
domain
it
is
a
template
for
much
of
what
would
follow
the
paranoia
the
government
disinformation
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
the
saucers
are
not
of
this
earth
keyhoe
with
his
spare
matter
of
fact
writing
style
which
also
conveys
a
profound
sense
of
wonder
has
to
be
the
prototype
for
the
deadpan
fox
mulder
of
the
on
one
hand
we
can
see
the
birth
of
a
key
modern
mythology
on
the
other
there
is
a
body
of
almost
naive
evidence
in
this
text
unpolluted
by
that
very
mythology
the
case
studies
are
real
the
witnesses
were
highly
reliable
these
cases
are
still
unexplained

his

he
is
a

of

he
flew

author
note
on
april
the
air
force
stated
the
mere
existence
of
some
yet
unidentified
flying
objects
necessitates
a
constant
vigilance
on
the
part
of
project
personnel
and
on
the
part
of
the
civilian
population
answers
have
been
and
will
be
drawn
from
such
factors
as
guided
missile
research
activity
balloons
astronomical
phenomena
but
there
are
still
question
marks
possibilities
that
the
saucers
are
foreign
aircraft
have
also
been
considered
but
observations
based
on
nuclear
power
plant
research
in
this
country
label
as
improbable
the
existence
on
earth
of
engines
small
enough
to
have
powered
the
saucers
intelligent
life
on
mars
is
not
impossible
but
is
completely
unproven
the
possibility
of
intelligent
life
on
the
planet
venus
is
not
considered
completely
unreasonable
by
astronomers
the
saucers
are
not
jokes
neither
are
they
cause
for
alarm
on
december
the
air
force
denied
the
existence
of
flying
saucers
on
december
the
air
force
revealed
part
of
a
secret
project
saucer
report
to
members
of
the
press
at
washington
the
official
report
stated
it
will
never
be
possible
to
say
with
certainty
that
any
individual
did
not
see
a
space
ship
an
enemy
missile
or
some
other
object
discussing
the
motives
of
possible
visitors
from
space
the
report
also
stated
such
a
civilization
might
observe
that
on
earth
we
now
have
atomic
bombs
and
are
fast
developing
rockets
in
view
of
the
past
history
of
mankind
they
should
be
project
saucer
preliminary
study
of
flying

air
force
press
release
alarmed
we
should
therefore
expect
at
this
time
above
all
to
behold
such
visitations
in
its
april
report
project
saucer
stated
that
space
travel
outside
the
solar
system
is
almost
a
certainty
on
february
the
air
force
again
denied
the
existence
of
flying
saucers
on
this
same
date
two
saucers
reported
above
key
west
naval
air
station
were
tracked
by
radar
they
were
described
as
maneuvering
at
high
speed
fifty
miles
above
the
earth
the
air
force
refused
to
comment
on
march
a
large
metallic
disk
was
pursued
by
and
jet
fighters
and
observed
by
scores
of
air
force
officers
at
wright
field
ohio
on
march
an
air
force
spokesman
again
denied
that
saucers
exist
and
specifically
stated
that
they
were
not
american
guided
missiles
or
devices
i
have
carefully
examined
all
air
force
saucer
reports
made
in
the
last
three
years
for
the
past
year
i
have
taken
part
in
a
special
investigation
of
the
riddle
i
believe
that
the
air
force
statements
contradictory
as
they
appear
are
part
of
an
intricate
program
to
prepare
america
and
the
world
for
the
secret
of
the
disks
chapter
i
it
was
a
strange
assignment
i
picked
up
the
telegram
from
my
desk
and
read
it
a
third
time
new
york
may
have
been
investigating
flying
saucer
mystery
first
tip
hinted
gigantic
hoax
to
cover
up
official
secret
believe
it
may
have
been
planted
to
hide
real
answer
looks
like
terrific
story
can
you
take
over
washington
end
ken
purdy
editor
true
magazine
i
glanced
out
at
the
potomac
recalling
the
first
saucer
story
as
a
pilot
i
been
skeptical
of
flying
disks
then
reports
had
begun
to
pour
in
from
air
force
and
airline
pilots
apparently
alarmed
the
air
force
had
ordered
fighters
to
pursue
the
saucers
in
one
mysterious
chase
a
pilot
had
been
killed
and
his
death
was
unexplained
that
had
been
seventeen
months
ago
since
then
the
whole
riddle
had
been
hidden
behind
a
curtain
of
air
force
secrecy
and
now
an
assignment
from
true
magazine
on
flying
saucers
hours
later
i
was
in
ken
purdy
office
i
had
men
on
this
for
two
months
he
told
me
i
might
as
well
warn
you
it
a
tough
story
to
crack
you
think
it
a
russian
missile
i
asked
him
or
an
air
force
secret
we
had
several
answers
none
of
them
stacks
up
but
i
positive
one
was
deliberately
planted
when
they
found
we
were
checking
he
told
me
the
whole
story
of
the
work
that
had
been
done
by
the
staff
of
true
and
of
the
reports
sent
in
by
competent
writers
the
deeper
he
delved
into
the
mystery
the
tougher
the
assignment
got
the
more
i
learned
about
flying
saucers
the
less
i
knew
there
one
angle
i
want
rechecked
purdy
said
you
heard
of
the
mantell
case
i
nodded
try
to
get
the
details
of
mantell
radio
report
to
godman
tower
before
he
was
killed
he
described
the
thing
he
was
chasing
we
know
that
much
project
gave
out
a
hint
but
they
never
released
the
transcript
here
another
lead
see
if
you
can
find
anything
about
a
secret
picture
taken
at
harmon
field
newfoundland
it
was
around
july
i
send
you
other
ideas
as
i
get
them
before
i
left
purdy
wished
me
hick
and
told
me
that
he
would
work
in
closest
harmony
with
me
but
watch
out
for
fake
tips
he
said
you
probably
run
into
some
people
at
the
pentagon
who
talk
to
you
the
record
that
handcuffs
a
writer
look
out
they
do
lead
you
into
a
blind
alley
even
the
air
force
statements
and
the
project
report
contradict
each
other
for
six
months
i
worked
with
other
investigators
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
disks
we
checked
a
hundred
sighting
reports
frequently
crossing
the
trail
of
project
saucer
teams
and
agents
old
records
gave
fantastic
leads
so
did
air
force
plans
for
exploring
space
rocket
experts
astronomers
air
force
officials
and
pilot
gave
us
clues
pointing
to
a
startling
solution
many
intelligent
persons
including
scientists
believe
that
the
saucers
contain
spies
from
another
planet
when
this
first
phase
was
ended
we
were
faced
with
a
hard
decision
we
had
uncovered
important
facts
we
knew
the
saucers
were
real
if
it
was
handled
carefully
we
believed
the
story
would
be
in
line
with
a
secret
air
force
policy
it
was
finally
decided
to
publish
certain
alternate
conclusions
the
air
force
was
informed
of
true
intentions
no
attempt
was
made
to
block
publication
in
the
january
issue
of
true
i
reported
that
we
had
reached
the
following
conclusions
the
earth
has
been
observed
periodically
by
visitors
from
another
planet
this
observation
has
increased
markedly
in
the
past
two
years
the
only
other
possible
explanation
i
wrote
is
that
the
saucers
are
extremely
devices
developed
here
on
earth
such
an
advance
which
the
air
force
has
denied
would
require
an
almost
incredible
leap
in
technical
progress
even
for
american
scientists
and
designers
press
and
radio
comment
followed
the
appearance
of
the
article
this
publicity
was
obviously
greater
than
the
air
force
had
expected
within
hours
the
pentagon
was
deluged
with
telegrams
letters
and
calls
apparently
fearing
a
panic
the
air
force
hastily
stated
that
reports
even
those
made
by
its
own
pilots
and
officers
were
mistakes
or
were
caused
by
hysteria
but
three
days
later
when
it
was
plain
that
many
americans
calmly
accepted
true
disclosures
the
air
force
released
a
secret
project
saucer
file
containing
this
significant
statement
it
will
never
be
possible
to
say
with
certainty
that
any
individual
did
not
see
a
space
ship
an
enemy
missile
or
other
object
in
this
same
document
there
appears
a
confidential
analysis
of
air
intelligence
reports
it
is
this
summary
that
contains
the
official
suggestion
of
space
visitors
motives
after
stating
that
such
a
civilization
would
obviously
be
far
ahead
of
our
own
the
report
adds
since
the
acts
of
mankind
most
easily
observed
from
a
distance
are
explosions
we
should
expect
some
relation
to
obtain
between
the
time
of
the
explosions
the
time
at
which
the
space
ships
are
seen
and
the
time
required
for
such
ships
to
arrive
from
and
return
to
home
base
in
a
previous
report
which
alternately
warned
and
reassured
the
public
the
air
force
stated
that
space
travel
outside
the
solar
system
is
almost
a
certainty
since
there
has
been
a
steady
increase
in
saucer
sightings
most
of
them
have
been
authentic
reports
which
air
force
denials
can
not
disprove

were
reported
over
kentucky
indiana
texas
pennsylvania
and
several
other
states
on
the
seattle
anchorage
route
an
air
freighter
was
paced
for
five
minutes
by
a
saucer
when
the
pilots
tried
to
close
in
the
strange
craft
zoomed
at
terrific
speed
later
the
airline
head
reported
that
intelligence
officers
had
quizzed
the
pilots
for
hours
from
their
questions
he
said
i
could
tell
they
had
a
good
idea
of
what
the
saucers
are
one
officer
admitted
they
did
but
he
say
any
more
another
peculiar
incident
occurred
at
tucson
arizona
on
february
just
at
dusk
a
weird
fiery
object
raced
westward
over
the
city
astonishing
hundreds
in
the
streets
below
the
tucson
daily
citizen
ran
the
story
next
day
with
a
headline
flying
saucer
over
tucson
fails
to
catch
object
flying
saucer
secret
experimental
plane
or
perhaps
a
scout
craft
from
mars
certainly
the
strange
aircraft
that
blazed
a
smoke
trail
over
tucson
at
dusk
last
night
defies
logical
explanation
it
was
as
mystifying
to
experienced
pilots
as
to
groundlings
who
have
trouble
in
identifying
conventional
planes
cannonballing
through
the
sky
some
feet
aloft
was
a
fiery
object
shooting
westward
so
fast
it
was
impossible
to
gain
any
clear
impression
of
its
shape
or
size
at
what
must
have
been
top
speed
the
object
spewed
out
light
colored
smoke
but
almost
directly
over
tucson
it
appeared
to
hover
for
a
few
seconds
the
smoke
puffed
out
an
angry
black
and
then
be
came
lighter
as
the
strange
missile
appeared
to
gain
speed
the
radio
operator
in
the
air
force
base
control
tower
contacted
first
roy
jones
taking
off
for
a
flight
in
a
and
asked
him
to
investigate
jones
revved
up
his
swift
aerial
tanker
and
still
the
unknown
aircraft
steadily
pulled
away
toward
california
edwin
carpenter
head
of
the
university
of
arizona
department
of
astronomy
said
he
was
certain
that
the
object
was
not
a
meteor
or
other
natural
phenomenon
switchboards
swamped
switchboards
at
the
pima
county
sheriff
office
and
tucson
police
station
were
jammed
with
inquiries
hundreds
saw
the
object
tom
bailey
street
thought
it
was
a
large
airplane
on
fire
a
later
check
showed
no
planes
missing
he
said
it
wavered
from
left
to
right
as
it
passed
over
the
mountains
bailey
also
noticed
that
the
craft
appeared
to
slow
perceptibly
over
tucson
he
said
the
smoke
apparently
came
out
in
a
thin
almost
invisible
stream
gaining
substance
within
a
few
seconds
this
incident
had
an
odd
sequel
the
following
day
its
significance
was
not
lost
on
the
daily
citizen
it
ran
another
story
headlined
what
do
you
mean
only
vapor
trail
as
though
to
prove
itself
blameless
for
tilting
hundreds
of
tucson
heads
skyward
the
air
force
yesterday
afternoon
spent
hours
etching
vapor
trails
through
the
skies
over
the
city
the
demonstration
proved
conclusively
to
the
satisfaction
of
most
that
the
strange
path
of
dark
smoke
blazed
across
the
evening
sky
at
dusk
wednesday
was
no
vapor
trail
and
did
not
emanate
from
any
conventional
airplane
the
wednesday
night
spectacle
was
entirely
dissimilar
then
heavy
smoke
boiled
and
swirled
in
a
broad
dark
ribbon
fanning
out
at
least
a
mile
in
width
and
stretching
across
the
sky
in
a
straight
line
since
there
was
no
proof
as
to
what
caused
the
strange
predark
manifestation
and
because
even
expert
witnesses
were
unable
to
explain
the
appearance
the
matter
remains
a
subject
for
interesting
speculation
there
is
strong
evidence
that
this
story
was
deliberately
kept
off
the
press
wires
the
associated
press
and
other
wire
services
in
washington
had
no
report
requests
for
details
by
frank
edwards
mutual
newscaster
and
other
radio
commentators
ran
into
a
blank
wall
at
the
pentagon
i
was
told
that
the
air
force
had
no
knowledge
of
the
sighting
or
the
maneuvers
on
february
two
similar
glowing
objects
were
seen
above
boca
chica
naval
air
station
at
key
west
a
plane
sent
tip
to
investigate
was
hopelessly
outdistanced
it
was
obvious
the
things
were
at
a
great
height
back
at
the
station
radarmen
tracked
the
objects
as
they
hovered
for
a
moment
above
key
west
they
were
found
to
be
at
least
fifty
miles
above
the
earth
after
a
few
seconds
they
accelerated
at
high
speed
and
streaked
out
of
sight
on
the
following
day
commander
augusto
orrego
a
chilean
naval
officer
reported
that
saucers
had
flown
above
his
antarctic
base
during
the
bright
antarctic
night
be
said
we
saw
flying
saucers
one
above
the
other
turning
at
tremendous
speeds
we
have
photographs
to
prove
what
we
saw
early
in
march
ken
purdy
phoned
the
latest
development
in
the
investigation
he
had
just
received
a
tip
predicting
a
flurry
of
saucer
publicity
during
march
it
had
come
from
an
important
source
in
washington
you
know
what
it
probably
means
he
said
the
same
thing
we
talked
about
last
month
but
why
were
we
tipped
off
in
advance
it
one
more
piece
in
the
pattern
i
said
if
the
tip
on
the
level
then
they
stepping
up
the
program
within
three
days
reports
began
to
pour
in
from
peru
cuba
mexico
turkey
and
other
parts
of
the
world
then
on
march
a
gleaming
metallic
disk
was
sighted
over
dayton
ohio
observers
at
vandalia
airport
phoned
field
scores
of
air
force
pilots
and
groundmen
watched
the
disk
as
fighters
raced
up
in
pursuit
the
mysterious
object
streaked
vertically
skyward
hovered
for
a
while
miles
above
the
earth
and
then
disappeared
a
secret
report
was
rushed
to
the
civil
aeronautics
authority
in
washington
then
turned
over
to
air
force
intelligence
soon
after
this
craig
hunter
director
of
a
medical
supply
firm
reported
a
huge
elliptical
saucer
flying
at
a
low
altitude
in
pennsylvania
he
described
it
as
metallic
with
a
slotted
outer
rim
and
a
rotating
ring
just
inside
on
top
of
this
sighting
thousands
of
people
at
farmington
new
mexico
watched
a
large
formation
of
disks
pass
high
above
the
city
throughout
all
these
reports
the
air
force
refused
to
admit
the
existence
of
flying
saucers
on
march
it
flatly
denied
they
were
air
force
secret
missiles
or
devices
three
days
later
a
chicago
and
southern
airliner
crew
saw
a
disk
near
stuttgart
arkansas
the
circular
craft
blinking
a
strange
light
pulled
up
in
an
arc
at
terrific
speed
the
two
pilots
said
they
glimpsed
lighted
ports
on
the
lower
side
as
the
saucer
zoomed
above
them
the
lights
had
a
soft
fluorescence
unlike
anything
they
had
seen
there
was
one
peculiar
angle
in
the
arkansas
incident
there
was
no
apparent
attempt
to
muzzle
the
two
pilots
as
in
earlier
airline
cases
instead
a
united
press
interview
was
quickly
arranged
for
publication
in
this
wire
story
captain
jack
adams
and
first
officer
anderson
made
two
statements
we
firmly
believe
that
the
flying
saucer
we
saw
over
arkansas
was
a
secret
experimental
type
aircraft
not
a
visitor
from
outer
space
we
know
the
air
force
has
denied
there
is
anything
to
this
business
but
we
both
experienced
pilots
and
not
easily
fooled
the
day
after
this
story
appeared
i
was
discussing
it
with
an
airline
official
in
washington
that
an
odd
thing
he
said
the
air
force
could
have
persuaded
those
pilots
or
the
line
president
to
hush
the
thing
up
it
looks
as
if
they
wanted
that
story
broadcast
you
mean
the
whole
thing
was
planted
i
wo
say
that
though
it
could
have
been
probably
they
did
see
something
but
they
might
have
been
told
what
to
say
about
it
any
idea
why
he
looked
at
me
sharply
you
and
purdy
probably
know
the
answer
at
a
guess
i
say
it
might
have
been
planned
to
offset
that
navy
commander
report
the
one
on
the
white
sands
sightings
the
white
sands
case
had
puzzled
many
skeptics
because
the
pentagon
had
cleared
the
published
report
the
author
commander
mclaughlin
was
a
regular
navy
officer
as
a
navy
rocket
expert
he
had
been
stationed
at
the
white
sands
rocket
proving
ground
in
new
mexico
in
his
published
article
he
described
three
disk
sightings
at
white
sands
one
of
the
disks
a
huge
elliptical
craft
was
tracked
by
scientists
with
precision
instruments
at
five
miles
per
second
that
miles
per
hour
it
was
found
to
be
flying
miles
above
the
earth
two
other
disks
smaller
types
were
watched
from
five
observation
posts
on
hills
at
the
proving
ground
circling
at
incredible
speed
the
two
disks
paced
an
army
rocket
that
had
just
been
launched
then
speeded
up
and
swiftly
outclimbed
the
projectile
commander
mclaughlin
report
giving
dates
and
factual
details
was
cleared
by
the
department
of
defense
so
was
a
later
broadcast
then
the
air
force
made
its
routine
denial
why
was
mclaughlin
a
regular
navy
officer
subject
to
security
screening
permitted
to
give
out
this
story
was
it
an
incredible
or
was
it
part
of
some
carefully
plan
i
believe
it
was
part
of
an
elaborate
program
to
prepare
the
american
people
for
a
dramatic
disclosure
for
almost
a
year
i
have
watched
the
maneuvers
of
those
who
guide
this
program
in
the
following
chapters
i
have
tried
to
show
the
strange
developments
in
our
search
for
the
answer
the
carefully
misleading
tips
the
blind
alleys
we
entered
the
unexpected
assistance
the
confidential
leads
and
the
stunning
contradictions
it
has
been
a
complicated
jigsaw
puzzle
only
by
seeing
all
parts
of
this
intricate
picture
can
you
begin
to
glimpse
the
reasons
for
this
stubbornly
hidden
secret
the
official
explanation
may
be
imminent
when
it
is
finally
revealed
i
believe
the
elaborate
preparation
even
the
wide
deceit
involved
will
be
fully
justified
in
the
minds
of
the
american
people
chapter
ii
it
has
been
over
two
years
since
the
puzzling
death
of
captain
thomas
mantell
mantell
died
mysteriously
in
the
skies
south
of
fort
knox
but
before
his
radio
went
silent
he
sent
a
strange
message
to
godman
air
force
base
the
men
who
heard
it
will
never
forget
it
it
was
january
crowded
into
the
godman
field
tower
a
group
of
air
force
officers
stared
up
at
the
afternoon
sky
for
just
an
instant
something
gleamed
through
the
broken
clouds
south
of
the
base
high
above
the
field
three
fighters
climbed
with
swift
urgency
heading
south
they
quickly
vanished
the
clock
in
the
tower
read
colonel
guy
hix
the
slowly
put
down
his
binoculars
if
the
thing
was
still
there
the
clouds
now
hid
it
all
they
could
do
was
wait
the
first
alarm
had
come
from
fort
knox
when
army
had
relayed
a
state
police
warning
a
huge
gleaming
object
had
been
seen
in
the
sky
moving
toward
godman
field
hundreds
of
startled
people
had
seen
it
at
madisonville
ninety
miles
away
thirty
minutes
later
it
had
zoomed
up
over
the
base
colonel
hix
glanced
around
at
the
rest
of
the
men
in
the
tower
they
all
had
a
dazed
look
every
man
there
had
seen
the
thing
as
it
barreled
south
of
the
field
even
through
the
thin
clouds
its
intermittent
red
glow
had
hinted
at
some
mysterious
source
of
power
something
outside
their
understanding
it
was
woods
the
exec
who
had
estimated
its
size
hix
shook
his
head
that
was
unbelievable
but
something
had
hung
over
godman
field
for
almost
an
hour
the
turned
quickly
as
the
tuned
to
the
suddenly
came
to
life
captain
mantell
to
godman
tower
mantell
to
godman
tower
the
flight
leader
voice
had
a
strained
tone
i
sighted
the
thing
he
said
it
looks
metallic
and
tremendous
in
size
the
and
woods
stared
at
each
other
no
one
spoke
the
thing
starting
to
climb
mantell
said
swiftly
it
at
twelve
high
making
half
my
speed
i
try
to
close
in
in
five
minutes
mantell
reported
again
the
strange
metallic
object
had
speeded
up
was
now
making
or
more
at
mantell
wingman
called
in
both
he
and
the
other
pilot
had
seen
the
weird
object
but
mantell
had
outclimbed
them
and
was
lost
in
the
clouds
seven
minutes
dragged
by
the
men
in
the
tower
sweated
out
the
silence
then
at
mantell
made
a
hasty
contact
it
still
above
me
making
my
speed
or
better
i
going
up
to
twenty
thousand
feet
if
i
no
closer
i
abandon
chase
it
was
his
last
report
minutes
later
his
fighter
disintegrated
with
terrific
force
the
falling
wreckage
was
scattered
for
thousands
of
feet
when
mantell
failed
to
answer
the
tower
one
of
his
pilots
began
a
search
climbing
to
feet
he
flew
a
hundred
miles
to
the
south
but
the
thing
that
lured
mantell
to
his
death
had
vanished
from
the
sky
ten
days
after
mantell
was
killed
i
learned
of
a
curious
sequel
to
the
godman
affair
an
account
in
the
new
york
times
had
caught
my
attention
the
story
released
at
fort
knox
admitted
mantell
had
died
while
chasing
a
flying
saucer
colonel
hix
was
quoted
as
having
watched
the
object
which
was
still
unidentified
but
there
was
no
mention
of
radio
messages
no
hint
of
the
thing
tremendous
size
though
i
knew
the
lid
was
probably
on
i
went
to
the
pentagon
when
the
scare
had
first
broken
in
the
summer
of
i
had
talked
with
captain
tom
brown
who
was
handling
saucer
inquiries
but
by
now
brown
had
been
shifted
and
no
one
in
the
press
branch
would
admit
knowing
the
details
of
the
mantell
saucer
chase
we
just
do
know
the
answer
a
security
officer
told
me
there
a
rumor
i
said
it
a
secret
air
force
missile
that
sometimes
goes
out
of
control
good
god
man
he
exploded
if
it
was
do
you
think
we
be
ordering
pilots
to
chase
the
damned
things
no
and
i
did
say
i
believed
it
i
waited
until
he
cooled
down
this
order
you
mentioned
is
it
for
all
air
force
pilots
or
special
fighter
units
i
did
say
it
was
a
special
order
he
answered
quickly
all
pilots
have
routine
instructions
to
report
unusual
items
they
had
fighters
alerted
on
the
coast
when
the
scare
first
broke
i
reminded
him
are
those
orders
still
in
force
he
shook
his
head
no
not
that
i
know
of
after
a
moment
he
added
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the
air
force
is
still
investigating
we
honestly
do
know
the
answer
as
i
went
out
the
mall
entrance
i
ran
into
jack
daly
one
of
washington
veteran
newsmen
before
the
war
jack
and
i
had
done
magazine
pieces
together
usually
on
axis
espionage
and
communist
activity
i
told
him
i
was
trying
to
find
the
answer
to
death
you
heard
anything
i
asked
him
only
what
was
in
the
story
said
jack
but
an
man
told
me
they
had
a
saucer
story
from
columbus
ohio
and
it
might
have
been
the
same
one
they
saw
at
fort
knox
i
missed
that
what
was
it
they
sighted
the
thing
at
the
air
force
field
outside
of
columbus
it
was
around
sundown
about
two
hours
after
that
pilot
was
killed
in
kentucky
anybody
chase
it
i
asked
no
they
did
have
time
to
take
off
i
guess
this
guy
said
it
was
going
like
hell
fast
as
a
jet
anyway
did
he
say
what
it
looked
like
the
air
force
boys
said
it
was
as
big
as
a
said
jack
maybe
bigger
it
had
a
exhaust
streaming
out
behind
they
could
see
it
for
miles
if
you
hear
any
more
let
me
know
i
said
jack
promised
he
would
what
do
you
think
they
are
he
asked
me
it
got
me
stumped
russia
would
be
testing
missiles
over
here
anyway
i
ca
believe
they
got
anything
like
that
and
i
see
the
air
force
letting
pilots
get
killed
to
hide
something
got
one
week
later
i
heard
that
a
unit
had
been
set
up
at
wright
field
to
investigate
all
saucer
reports
when
i
called
the
pentagon
they
admitted
this
much
and
that
was
all
in
the
next
few
months
other
stories
hit
the
front
pages
two
eastern
airline
pilots
reported
a
mystery
ship
sighted
near
montgomery
alabama
i
learned
of
two
other
sightings
one
over
the
pacific
ocean
and
one
in
california
the
second
one
seen
through
field
glasses
was
described
as
as
large
as
a
there
were
also
rumors
of
disks
being
tracked
by
radar
but
it
was
almost
a
year
before
i
confirmed
these
reports
when
purdy
wired
me
early
in
may
of
i
had
half
forgotten
the
disks
it
had
been
months
since
any
important
sightings
had
been
reported
but
his
message
quickly
revived
my
curiosity
if
he
thought
the
subject
was
hot
i
knew
he
must
have
reasons
when
i
walked
into
his
office
at
west
purdy
stubbed
out
his
cigarette
and
shook
hands
he
looked
at
me
through
his
glasses
for
a
moment
then
he
said
abruptly
you
know
anything
about
the
disks
if
you
mean
what
they
are
no
he
motioned
for
me
to
sit
down
then
he
swiveled
his
chair
around
his
shoulders
hunched
forward
and
frowned
out
the
window
have
you
seen
the
post
this
week
i
told
him
no
there
something
damned
queer
going
on
for
fifteen
months
project
is
buttoned
up
tight
top
secret
then
suddenly
forrestal
gets
the
saturday
evening
post
to
run
two
articles
brushing
the
whole
thing
off
the
first
piece
hits
the
stands
and
then
what
happens
purdy
swung
around
jabbed
his
finger
at
a
document
on
his
desk
that
same
day
the
air
force
rushes
out
this
project
report
it
admits
they
have
identified
the
disks
in
any
important
cases
they
say
it
still
serious
enough
wait
a
minute
he
thumbed
through
the
stapled
papers
require
constant
vigilance
by
project
saucer
personnel
and
the
civilian
population
you
think
the
post
would
make
a
public
kick
i
said
i
do
mean
it
an
denial
said
purdy
it
mention
the
post
just
contradicts
it
in
fact
the
report
contradicts
itself
it
looks
as
if
they
trying
to
warn
people
and
yet
scared
to
say
too
much
i
looked
at
the
title
on
the
report
a
digest
of
preliminary
studies
by
the
air
materiel
command
wright
field
dayton
ohio
on
saucers
have
the
papers
caught
it
yet
i
asked
purdy
you
mean
its
contradicting
the
post
he
shook
his
head
no
the
pentagon
press
release
did
get
much
space
how
many
editors
would
wade
through
a
government
report
even
if
they
did
they
have
to
compare
it
item
for
item
with
the
post
piece
who
wrote
the
post
story
purdy
lit
a
cigarette
and
frowned
out
again
at
the
skyscrapers
sidney
shallett
and
he
careful
he
had
forrestal
backing
the
air
force
flew
him
around
arranged
interviews
supposedly
gave
him
inside
stuff
he
spent
two
months
on
it
they
his
script
which
practically
says
the
saucers
are
bunk
then
they
reneged
on
it
maybe
some
top
brass
suddenly
decided
it
was
the
wrong
policy
to
brush
it
off
i
suggested
why
the
quick
change
demanded
purdy
let
say
they
sold
the
post
on
covering
up
the
truth
in
the
interests
of
security
it
possible
though
i
do
believe
it
or
they
could
simply
have
fed
them
a
fake
story
either
way
why
did
they
rush
this
contradiction
the
minute
the
post
hit
the
stands
something
serious
happened
i
said
after
the
post
went
to
press
yes
but
what
purdy
said
impatiently
that
what
we
got
to
find
out
does
shallett
first
piece
mention
mantell
death
explains
it
perfectly
you
know
what
mantell
was
chasing
the
planet
venus
that
the
post
answer
i
said
incredulously
it
what
the
air
force
contract
astronomer
told
shallett
checked
with
two
astronomers
here
they
say
that
even
when
venus
is
at
full
magnitude
you
can
barely
see
it
in
the
daytime
even
when
looking
for
it
it
was
only
half
magnitude
that
day
so
it
was
practically
invisible
how
the
air
force
expect
anybody
to
believe
that
answer
i
said
purdy
shrugged
they
deny
it
was
venus
in
this
report
but
what
they
told
shallett
that
all
those
air
force
officers
the
pilots
the
kentucky
state
police
and
several
hundred
people
at
madisonville
mistook
venus
for
a
metallic
disk
several
hundred
feet
in
diameter
it
a
wonder
shallett
believed
it
i
do
think
he
did
he
says
if
it
was
venus
it
must
have
been
a
balloon
what
the
air
force
answer
i
asked
purdy
look
in
the
report
they
say
whatever
mantell
chased
they
call
it
a
object
is
still
unidentified
i
glanced
through
the
case
report
on
page
five
it
quoted
radio
report
that
the
thing
was
metallic
and
tremendous
in
size
linked
with
the
death
of
mantell
was
the
lockbourne
ohio
report
which
tied
in
with
what
jack
daly
had
told
me
over
a
year
before
i
read
the
report
on
the
same
day
about
two
hours
later
a
sky
phenomenon
was
observed
by
several
watchers
over
lockbourne
air
force
base
columbus
ohio
it
was
described
as
or
oval
larger
than
a
and
traveling
in
level
flight
faster
than
miles
per
hour
the
object
was
followed
from
the
lockbourne
observation
tower
for
more
than
minutes
observers
said
it
glowed
from
white
to
amber
leaving
an
amber
exhaust
trail
five
times
its
own
length
it
made
motions
like
an
elevator
and
at
one
time
appeared
to
touch
the
ground
no
sound
was
heard
finally
the
object
faded
and
lowered
toward
the
horizon
purdy
buzzed
for
his
secretary
and
she
brought
me
a
copy
of
the
first
post
article
you
can
get
a
copy
of
this
air
force
report
in
washington
purdy
told
me
this
is
the
only
one
i
have
but
you
find
the
same
answer
for
most
of
the
important
cases
the
sightings
at
muroc
air
base
the
airline
pilots
reports
the
disks
kenneth
arnold
saw
they
all
unidentified
i
remember
the
arnold
case
that
was
the
first
sighting
you
got
contacts
in
washington
purdy
went
on
start
at
the
pentagon
first
they
know
we
working
on
it
sam
boal
the
first
man
on
this
job
was
down
there
for
a
day
or
two
what
did
he
find
out
symington
told
him
the
saucers
were
bunk
secretary
johnson
admitted
they
had
some
pictures
we
heard
about
a
secret
photograph
taken
at
harmon
field
newfoundland
the
tip
said
this
saucer
scared
hell
out
of
some
pilots
and
air
force
men
up
there
a
major
took
boal
to
some
air
force
colonel
and
boal
asked
to
see
the
pictures
the
colonel
said
they
did
have
any
he
turned
red
when
the
major
said
symington
had
told
boal
about
the
pictures
did
boal
get
to
see
them
i
said
no
grunted
purdy
and
i
bet
twenty
bucks
you
wo
either
but
try
anyway
and
check
on
a
rumor
that
they
tracked
some
disks
with
radar
one
case
was
supposed
to
be
at
an
air
force
base
in
japan
as
i
was
leaving
purdy
gave
me
a
summary
of
sighting
reports
some
of
these
were
published
some
we
dug
up
ourselves
he
said
we
got
some
confidential
stuff
from
airline
pilots
it
pretty
obvious
the
air
force
has
tried
to
keep
them
quiet
all
right
i
said
i
get
started
maybe
things
are
sewed
up
so
tightly
now
this
report
is
out
we
found
out
some
things
about
project
said
purdy
whether
it
a
or
a
real
investigation
there
a
lot
of
business
to
it
they
got
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
working
for
them
also
rocket
expects
technical
analysts
and
air
force
special
intelligence
we
been
told
they
can
call
on
any
government
agency
for
help
and
i
know
they
using
the
it
was
building
up
bigger
than
i
had
thought
if
national
security
is
involved
i
told
purdy
they
can
shut
us
up
in
a
hurry
if
they
tell
me
so
said
purdy
he
added
grimly
but
i
think
they
making
a
bad
mistake
they
probably
think
they
doing
right
but
the
truth
might
come
out
the
wrong
way
it
is
possible
i
thought
that
the
saucers
belong
to
russia
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
soviet
missile
count
me
out
i
said
have
the
pentagon
and
the
on
our
necks
all
right
if
that
the
answer
he
chuckled
but
you
may
be
in
for
a
jolt
chapter
iii
just
the
idea
of
gigantic
flying
disks
was
incredible
enough
it
was
almost
as
hard
to
believe
that
such
missiles
could
have
been
developed
without
something
leaking
out
yet
we
had
produced
the
in
comparative
secrecy
and
i
knew
we
were
working
on
guided
missiles
there
was
already
a
plan
for
a
test
range
our
supersonic
planes
had
hit
around
two
thousand
miles
an
hour
our
rockets
had
gone
over
two
hundred
miles
high
according
to
reports
if
an
atomic
engine
had
been
secretly
developed
it
could
explain
the
speed
and
range
of
the
saucers
but
i
kept
coming
back
to
mantell
death
and
the
air
force
orders
for
pilots
to
chase
the
saucers
if
the
disks
were
american
missiles
that
did
jibe
when
i
reached
the
lobby
i
found
it
was
ten
after
four
i
caught
a
taxi
and
made
the
congressional
limited
with
just
one
minute
to
spare
in
the
club
car
i
settled
down
to
look
at
purdy
summary
skipping
through
the
pages
i
saw
several
familiar
cases
here
and
there
purdy
had
scrawled
brief
comments
or
suggestions
beside
the
eastern
airline
report
of
a
saucer
he
had
written
check
rumor
same
type
seen
over
holland
about
this
date
also
similar
philippine
islands
report
date
unknown
i
went
back
to
the
beginning
the
first
case
listed
was
that
of
kenneth
arnold
a
boise
businessman
who
had
set
off
the
saucer
scare
arnold
was
flying
his
private
plane
from
chehalis
to
yakima
washington
when
he
saw
a
bright
flash
on
his
wing
looking
toward
mount
rainier
he
saw
nine
gleaming
disks
outlined
against
the
snow
each
one
about
the
size
of
a
they
flew
close
to
the
mountaintops
in
a
diagonal
chainlike
line
he
said
later
it
was
as
if
they
were
linked
together
the
disks
appeared
to
be
twenty
to
miles
away
he
said
and
moving
at
fantastic
speed
arnold
estimate
was
twelve
hundred
miles
an
hour
i
watched
them
about
three
minutes
he
said
they
were
swerving
in
and
out
around
the
high
mountain
peaks
they
were
flat
like
a
pie
pan
and
so
shiny
they
reflected
the
sun
like
a
mirror
i
never
saw
anything
so
fast
the
date
was
june
on
this
same
day
there
was
another
saucer
report
which
received
very
little
notice
a
portland
prospector
named
fred
johnson
who
was
working
up
in
the
cascade
mountains
spotted
five
or
six
disks
banking
in
the
sun
he
watched
them
through
his
telescope
several
seconds
then
he
suddenly
noticed
that
the
compass
hand
on
his
special
watch
was
weaving
wildly
from
side
to
side
johnson
insisted
he
had
not
heard
of
the
arnold
report
which
was
not
broadcast
until
early
evening
kenneth
arnold
story
was
generally
received
with
amusement
most
americans
were
unaware
that
the
pentagon
had
been
receiving
disk
reports
as
early
as
january
the
news
and
radio
comments
on
report
brought
several
other
incidents
to
light
which
observers
had
kept
to
themselves
for
fear
of
ridicule
at
oklahoma
city
a
private
pilot
told
air
force
investigators
he
had
seen
a
huge
round
object
in
the
sky
during
the
latter
part
of
may
it
was
flying
three
times
faster
than
a
jet
he
said
and
without
any
sound
citizens
of
weiser
idaho
described
two
strange
objects
they
had
seen
on
june
the
saucers
were
heading
southeast
now
and
then
dropping
to
a
lower
altitude
then
swiftly
climbing
again
several
mysterious
objects
were
reported
flying
at
great
speed
near
spokane
just
three
days
before
arnold
experience
and
four
days
after
his
encounter
an
air
force
pilot
flying
near
lake
meade
nevada
was
startled
to
see
half
a
dozen
saucers
flash
by
his
plane
even
at
this
early
point
in
the
scare
official
reports
were
contradicting
each
other
just
after
arnold
story
broke
the
air
force
admitted
it
was
checking
on
the
mystery
disks
on
july
the
air
force
stated
that
no
further
investigation
was
needed
it
was
all
hallucination
that
same
day
wright
field
told
the
associated
press
that
the
air
materiel
command
was
trying
to
find
the
answer
the
fourth
of
july
was
a
day
in
the
mystery
at
portland
oregon
hundreds
of
citizens
including
former
air
force
pilots
police
harbor
pilots
and
deputy
sheriffs
saw
dozens
of
gleaming
disks
flying
at
high
speed
the
things
appeared
to
be
at
least
forty
thousand
feet
in
the
air
perhaps
much
higher
that
same
day
disks
were
sighted
at
seattle
vancouver
and
other
northwest
cities
the
rapidly
growing
reports
were
met
with
mixed
ridicule
and
alarm
one
of
the
skeptical
group
was
captain
smith
of
united
airlines
i
believe
them
when
i
see
them
he
told
airline
employees
before
taking
off
from
boise
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
just
about
sunset
his
airliner
was
flying
over
emmett
idaho
when
captain
smith
and
his
copilot
ralph
stevens
saw
five
queer
objects
in
the
sky
ahead
smith
rang
for
the
stewardess
marty
morrow
and
the
three
of
them
watched
the
saucers
for
several
minutes
then
four
more
of
the
disks
came
into
sight
though
it
was
impossible
to
tell
their
size
because
their
altitude
was
unknown
the
crew
was
sure
they
were
bigger
than
the
plane
they
were
in
after
about
ten
minutes
the
disks
disappeared
the
air
force
quickly
denied
having
anything
resembling
the
objects
captain
smith
described
we
have
no
experimental
craft
of
that
nature
in
idaho
or
anywhere
else
an
official
said
in
washington
we
completely
mystified
the
navy
said
it
had
made
an
investigation
and
had
no
answers
there
had
been
rumors
that
the
disks
were
versions
of
the
flying
flapjack
a
circular
craft
known
technically
as
the
but
the
navy
insisted
that
only
one
model
had
been
built
and
that
it
was
now
out
of
service
in
chicago
two
astronomers
spiked
guesses
that
the
disks
might
be
meteors
girard
kieuper
director
of
the
university
of
chicago
observatory
said
flatly
that
they
could
be
meteors
they
probably
he
told
the
oliver
lee
director
of
northwestern
observatory
agreed
with
kieuper
the
army
navy
and
air
force
are
working
secretly
on
all
sorts
of
things
he
said
remember
the
secrecy
and
the
radar
signals
to
the
moon
as
i
went
through
purdy
summary
i
recalled
my
own
reaction
after
the
united
airlines
report
after
seeing
the
pentagon
comment
i
had
called
up
captain
tom
brown
at
air
force
public
relations
are
you
really
taking
this
seriously
i
asked
him
well
we
ca
just
ignore
it
he
said
there
are
too
many
reliable
pilots
telling
the
same
story
flat
round
objects
able
to
outmaneuver
ordinary
planes
and
faster
than
anything
we
have
too
many
stories
tally
i
told
him
i
heard
that
the
civil
air
patrol
in
wisconsin
and
other
states
was
starting
a
sky
search
we
got
a
jet
at
muroc
and
six
fighters
standing
by
at
portland
right
now
brown
said
armed
i
no
report
on
that
but
i
know
some
of
them
carry
photographic
equipment
two
days
later
an
airline
pilot
from
the
coast
told
me
that
some
fighters
had
been
armed
and
the
pilots
ordered
to
bring
down
the
disks
if
humanly
possible
that
same
day
wright
field
admitted
it
was
checking
stories
of
missiles
seen
recently
in
the
pacific
northwest
and
in
texas
following
this
was
an
story
dated
july
quoting
an
unnamed
air
force
official
in
washington
the
flying
saucers
may
be
one
of
three
things
solar
reflection
on
clouds
a
washington
scientist
asked
for
comment
said
this
was
hardly
possible
small
meteors
which
break
up
their
crystals
catching
the
rays
of
the
sun
but
it
would
seem
that
they
would
have
been
spotted
falling
and
fragments
would
have
been
found
icing
conditions
could
have
formed
large
hailstones
and
they
might
have
flattened
out
and
glided
a
bit
giving
the
impression
of
horizontal
movement
even
though
falling
vertically
by
this
time
everyone
was
getting
into
the
act
the
disks
are
caused
by
the
transmutation
of
atomic
energy
said
an
anonymous
scientist
supposed
to
be
on
the
staff
of
california
tech
the
college
quickly
denied
it
vannevar
bush
scientist
and
merle
tuve
inventor
of
the
proximity
fuse
both
declared
they
would
know
of
any
secret
american
missiles
and
did
at
syracuse
new
york
harry
steckel
veterans
administration
psychiatrist
scoffed
at
the
suggestion
of
mass
hysteria
too
many
sane
people
are
seeing
the
things
the
government
is
probably
conducting
some
revolutionary
experiments
on
july
more
disks
were
reported
out
at
muroc
air
force
base
where
planes
and
devices
are
tested
six
saucers
were
seen
by
pilots
and
ground
officers
that
afternoon
the
air
force
revealed
it
was
working
on
a
case
involving
a
navy
rocket
expert
named
zohm
while
on
a
secret
navy
mission
to
new
mexico
in
connection
with
rocket
tests
zohm
had
seen
a
bright
silvery
disk
flying
above
the
desert
he
was
crossing
the
desert
with
three
other
scientists
when
he
saw
the
strange
object
flashing
northward
at
an
altitude
of
about
ten
thousand
feet
i
sure
it
was
not
a
meteor
said
zohm
it
could
have
been
a
guided
missile
but
i
never
heard
of
anything
like
it
by
this
time
saucer
reports
had
come
in
from
almost
forty
states
alarm
was
increasing
and
there
were
demands
that
radar
be
used
to
track
the
disks
the
air
force
replied
that
there
was
not
enough
radar
equipment
to
blanket
the
nation
but
that
its
pilots
were
on
the
lookout
for
the
saucers
one
report
mentioned
a
curious
report
from
twin
falls
idaho
the
disk
sighted
there
was
said
to
have
flown
so
low
that
the
treetops
whirled
as
if
in
a
violent
storm
someone
had
phoned
purdy
about
a
disk
tracked
by
observers
at
richmond
virginia
there
was
another
note
on
a
sighting
at
hickam
field
honolulu
and
two
reports
of
unidentified
objects
seen
near
anchorage
alaska
a
typed
list
of
sightings
had
been
made
up
by
the
staff
at
true
it
contained
many
cases
that
were
new
to
me
reports
from
paraguay
belgium
turkey
holland
germany
and
the
scandinavian
countries
at
the
bottom
of
this
memo
purdy
had
written
keep
checking
on
rumor
that
the
soviet
has
a
project
saucer
too
could
be
planted
from
the
mass
of
reports
john
dubarry
the
aviation
editor
of
true
had
methodically
worked
out
an
average
picture
of
the
disks
the
general
report
is
that
they
are
round
or
oval
this
could
be
an
elliptical
object
seen
metallic
looking
very
bright
either
shining
white
or
silvery
colored
they
can
move
at
extremely
high
speed
hover
accelerate
rapidly
and
outmaneuver
ordinary
aircraft
the
lights
are
usually
seen
singly
very
few
formations
reported
they
seem
to
have
the
same
speed
acceleration
and
ability
to
maneuver
in
several
cases
they
have
been
able
to
evade
air
force
planes
in
night
encounters
going
over
the
cases
i
realized
that
purdy
and
his
staff
had
dug
up
at
least
fifty
reports
that
had
not
appeared
in
the
papers
a
few
of
these
proved
incorrect
but
a
check
with
the
air
force
case
reports
released
on
december
showed
that
true
files
contained
all
the
important
items
these
cases
included
sightings
at
eleven
air
force
bases
and
fourteen
american
airports
reports
from
ships
at
sea
and
a
score
of
encounters
by
airline
and
private
pilots
witnesses
included
army
navy
marine
corps
and
air
force
officers
state
and
city
police
agents
weather
observers
shipmasters
astronomers
and
thousands
of
good
solid
american
citizens
i
learned
later
that
many
witnesses
had
been
investigated
by
the
to
weed
out
crackpot
reports
i
ended
up
badly
puzzled
the
evidence
was
more
impressive
than
i
had
suspected
it
was
plain
that
many
reports
had
been
entirely
suppressed
or
at
least
kept
out
of
the
papers
there
was
something
ominous
about
it
no
matter
what
the
answer
it
was
serious
enough
to
be
kept
carefully
hidden
if
it
were
a
soviet
missile
i
thought
god
help
us
they
scooped
up
a
lot
of
nazi
scientists
and
war
secrets
and
the
germans
had
been
far
ahead
of
us
on
guided
missiles
but
why
would
they
give
us
a
warning
testing
the
things
openly
over
america
it
did
make
sense
chapter
iv
i
went
to
the
pentagon
the
next
morning
i
did
expect
to
learn
much
but
i
wanted
to
make
sure
we
were
tangling
with
security
i
worked
with
al
scholin
and
orville
splitt
in
the
magazine
section
of
public
relations
and
i
thought
they
tell
me
as
much
as
anyone
when
i
walked
in
i
sprang
it
on
them
cold
what
the
chance
of
seeing
your
project
files
al
scholin
took
it
more
or
less
splitt
looked
at
me
a
moment
and
then
grinned
do
tell
me
you
believe
the
things
are
real
maybe
i
said
how
about
clearing
me
with
project
al
shook
his
head
it
still
classified
secret
don
said
splitt
why
do
you
want
to
fool
with
that
saucer
business
there
nothing
to
it
that
a
big
change
from
what
the
air
force
was
saying
in
i
told
him
he
shrugged
that
off
the
air
force
has
spent
two
years
checking
into
it
everybody
from
symington
down
will
tell
you
the
saucers
are
bunk
that
not
what
project
says
in
that
april
report
that
report
was
made
up
a
long
time
ago
said
splitt
they
just
got
around
to
releasing
it
then
they
got
all
the
answers
now
they
know
there
nothing
to
it
splitt
repeated
in
that
case
i
said
project
should
object
to
my
seeing
their
files
and
pictures
what
pictures
that
one
taken
at
harmon
field
newfoundland
for
a
starter
oh
that
thing
said
splitt
it
was
anything
just
a
shadow
on
a
cloud
somebody
been
kidding
you
if
it
just
a
cloud
shadow
why
ca
i
see
it
splitt
was
getting
a
little
nettled
look
you
know
how
long
it
takes
to
declassify
stuff
they
just
have
got
around
to
it
take
my
word
for
it
the
flying
saucers
are
bunk
i
went
around
with
sid
shallett
on
some
of
his
interviews
what
he
got
in
the
post
is
the
absolute
gospel
it
funny
about
that
april
report
i
said
the
way
it
contradicts
the
post
i
tell
you
that
was
an
old
report
i
would
say
that
al
scholin
put
in
the
air
force
does
claim
it
has
all
the
answers
but
they
proved
a
lot
of
the
reports
were
hoaxes
or
mistakes
just
the
same
i
said
the
air
force
is
on
record
as
of
april
that
it
serious
enough
for
everybody
to
be
vigilant
and
they
admit
most
of
the
things
in
the
important
cases
are
still
unidentified
including
the
saucer
mantell
was
chasing
that
business
at
godman
field
was
some
kind
of
hallucination
insisted
splitt
i
suppose
all
those
pilots
and
godman
field
officers
were
hypnotized
not
to
mention
several
thousand
people
at
madisonville
and
fort
knox
take
it
easy
you
guys
said
al
scholin
you
both
got
a
right
to
your
opinions
oh
sure
said
splitt
he
looked
at
me
with
his
grin
back
i
care
if
you
think
they
men
from
mars
let
not
go
off
the
deep
end
i
said
tell
me
this
did
shallett
get
to
see
any
secret
files
at
wright
field
absolutely
not
then
he
had
to
take
the
air
force
word
for
everything
not
entirely
we
set
up
some
interviews
for
him
one
more
thing
and
do
get
mad
if
it
all
bunk
why
have
they
closed
project
how
do
i
know
probably
no
one
wants
to
take
the
responsibility
then
somebody
high
up
must
not
think
it
bunk
i
said
splitt
laughed
have
it
your
own
way
before
i
left
i
told
them
i
was
working
with
true
i
want
to
be
on
record
i
said
as
having
told
you
this
if
there
any
security
involved
if
you
tell
me
it
something
you
working
on
naturally
i
lay
off
al
scholin
said
emphatically
it
not
an
air
force
device
if
what
you
mean
some
people
think
it
russian
if
it
is
i
do
know
it
said
al
and
neither
does
the
air
force
after
i
left
the
magazine
section
i
tried
several
officers
i
knew
two
of
them
agreed
with
splitt
the
third
did
i
been
told
it
all
bunk
he
said
but
you
get
the
feeling
they
trying
to
convince
themselves
they
act
like
people
near
a
haunted
house
they
swear
it
is
haunted
but
they
wo
go
near
it
later
i
asked
a
security
major
for
a
copy
of
the
project
saucer
report
we
out
of
copies
right
now
he
said
i
send
you
one
next
week
i
asked
him
bluntly
what
he
thought
the
saucers
were
i
doubt
if
anybody
has
the
full
answer
he
said
seriously
been
some
hysteria
also
a
few
mistakes
but
many
reports
have
been
made
by
reliable
pilots
including
our
own
you
ca
laugh
those
off
as
i
drove
home
i
thought
over
what
i
heard
all
i
had
learned
was
that
the
air
force
seemed
divided
but
that
could
be
a
smoke
screen
in
less
than
hours
i
received
my
first
suspicious
tip
it
was
about
ten
when
my
phone
rang
keyhoe
this
is
john
steele
said
the
voice
at
the
other
end
because
of
the
peculiar
role
he
played
then
and
later
i
have
not
used
his
real
name
i
a
former
air
force
intelligence
officer
i
was
in
the
european
theater
during
the
war
i
waited
he
hesitated
a
moment
i
heard
you
working
on
the
problem
he
said
quickly
i
may
have
some
information
that
would
interest
you
mind
telling
me
who
told
you
i
was
on
it
i
asked
no
one
directly
i
just
happened
to
hear
it
mentioned
at
the
press
club
frankly
i
been
curious
about
the
flying
saucers
ever
since
that
startled
me
but
i
did
tell
him
so
do
you
have
any
idea
what
they
are
steele
said
no
i
just
begun
checking
but
i
be
glad
to
hear
what
got
i
may
be
way
off
said
steele
but
i
always
wondered
about
the
fighters
our
pilots
saw
over
europe
near
the
end
of
the
war
i
thought
for
a
second
was
that
some
kind
of
antiaircraft
missile
fired
from
the
ground
no
intelligence
never
did
get
any
real
answer
so
far
as
i
know
they
were
some
kind
of
circular
gadgets
and
they
actually
chased
our
planes
a
number
of
times
we
thought
they
were
something
the
nazis
had
invented
and
i
still
think
so
then
who
launching
them
now
well
it
obviously
either
russia
or
us
if
it
is
the
soviet
well
that
what
worried
me
i
do
think
it
should
be
treated
like
a
joke
the
way
some
people
in
the
pentagon
take
it
i
stared
at
the
phone
trying
to
figure
him
out
i
like
to
talk
it
over
with
you
i
said
maybe
you
got
something
i
given
you
about
all
i
know
steele
answered
there
was
an
intelligence
report
you
might
try
to
see
the
eighth
air
force
files
should
have
it
wait
a
minute
i
said
give
me
your
number
in
case
i
find
anything
he
gave
it
to
me
without
apparent
hesitation
i
thanked
him
and
hung
up
still
wondering
if
it
was
an
attempt
at
a
plant
it
was
certainly
crude
the
mention
of
his
former
air
force
connection
would
be
enough
to
arouse
suspicion
unless
he
counted
on
his
apparent
frankness
to
offset
it
and
what
about
the
press
club
angle
that
would
indicate
steele
was
a
newspaperman
could
this
be
merely
an
attempt
to
pump
me
and
get
a
lead
on
true
investigation
but
that
would
be
just
as
crude
as
the
other
idea
of
course
he
might
be
sincere
but
regardless
of
his
motives
it
looked
bad
arid
who
had
told
him
about
me
i
thought
about
that
for
a
minute
then
i
picked
up
the
phone
and
dialed
jack
daly
number
jack
do
you
know
anyone
named
john
steele
i
asked
him
i
think
he
a
newspaperman
nobody
i
know
said
jack
why
what
up
i
explained
and
added
i
thought
maybe
you
knew
him
and
he
heard
about
it
from
you
hell
no
said
jack
you
ought
to
know
i
would
leak
any
tip
like
that
it
would
be
a
tip
i
do
know
anything
about
this
deal
yet
by
the
way
when
you
were
on
the
star
did
you
handle
anything
on
fighters
no
that
was
after
i
left
there
bill
shippen
would
have
covered
that
anyway
i
told
him
i
would
look
it
up
in
the
star
morgue
jack
said
he
would
meet
me
there
at
three
in
the
meantime
he
would
see
what
he
could
find
out
about
steele
jack
was
a
little
late
and
i
went
over
the
star
file
on
the
foo
fighters
most
of
the
facts
were
covered
in
a
story
dated
july
which
had
been
inspired
by
the
outbreak
of
the
saucer
scare
i
copied
it
for
later
use
during
the
latter
part
of
world
war
two
fighter
pilots
in
england
were
convinced
that
hitler
had
a
new
secret
weapon
yanks
dubbed
these
devices
foo
fighters
or
kraut
fireballs
one
of
the
air
force
intelligence
men
now
assigned
to
check
on
the
saucer
scare
was
an
officer
who
investigated
statements
of
military
airmen
that
circular
foo
fighters
were
seen
over
europe
and
also
on
the
bombing
route
to
japan
it
was
reported
that
intelligence
officers
have
never
obtained
satisfactory
explanation
of
reports
of
flying
silver
balls
and
disks
over
europe
in
the
winter
of
later
crews
of
on
bombing
runs
to
japan
reported
seeing
somewhat
similar
objects
in
europe
some
foo
fighters
danced
just
off
the
allied
wingtips
and
played
tag
with
them
in
power
dives
others
appeared
in
precise
formations
and
on
one
occasion
a
whole
bomber
crew
saw
about
following
at
a
distance
their
strange
glow
flashing
on
and
off
one
foo
fighter
chased
lieutenant
meiers
of
chicago
some
miles
down
the
rhine
valley
at
an
war
correspondent
reported
intelligence
officers
believed
at
that
time
that
the
balls
might
be
objects
sent
up
to
foul
ignition
systems
or
baffle
allied
radar
networks
there
is
no
explanation
of
their
appearance
here
unless
the
objects
could
have
been
imported
for
secret
tests
in
this
country
i
read
the
last
paragraph
twice
this
looked
like
a
strong
lead
to
the
answer
in
spite
of
the
air
force
denials
there
was
another
less
pleasant
possibility
the
russians
could
have
seized
the
device
and
developed
it
secretly
using
nazi
scientists
to
help
them
perhaps
the
nazis
had
been
close
to
an
atomic
engine
even
if
they
did
fail
to
produce
the
bomb
jack
daly
came
in
while
i
was
reading
the
story
again
i
got
the
dope
on
steele
he
said
he
does
pieces
for
a
small
syndicate
and
i
found
out
he
was
in
the
air
force
i
think
he
was
a
captain
people
who
know
him
say
he
a
straight
shooter
that
still
would
keep
him
from
giving
me
a
fake
tip
if
somebody
told
him
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
maybe
not
said
jack
but
why
would
they
want
to
plant
this
idea
i
showed
him
the
clipping
he
read
it
over
and
shook
his
head
that
a
lot
different
from
disks
three
hundred
feet
in
diameter
if
we
got
the
principle
or
russia
big
ones
might
not
be
too
hard
i
still
ca
swallow
it
said
jack
these
things
have
been
seen
all
over
the
world
how
could
they
control
them
that
far
away
and
be
sure
they
would
crash
where
somebody
could
get
a
look
and
dope
out
the
secret
we
argued
it
back
and
forth
without
getting
anywhere
i
give
a
lot
to
know
steele
angle
i
said
if
you
hear
anything
more
on
him
give
me
a
buzz
jack
nodded
i
see
what
i
can
do
but
i
ca
dig
too
hard
or
he
hear
about
it
on
the
way
out
i
found
a
phone
booth
and
called
splitt
foo
fighters
he
said
sure
i
remember
those
stories
you
think
those
are
your
flying
saucers
i
could
hear
him
snicker
just
checking
angles
i
said
did
the
eighth
air
force
investigate
the
foo
fighters
yes
and
they
found
nothing
to
back
up
the
pilots
yarns
just
war
nerves
apparently
how
about
a
look
at
the
intelligence
report
i
asked
wait
a
minute
splitt
was
gone
for
twice
that
time
then
he
carne
back
sorry
it
classified
if
all
this
stuff
is
bunk
why
keep
the
lid
on
it
i
demanded
i
was
getting
sore
again
look
don
said
splitt
i
do
make
the
rules
sure
i
know
sorry
i
said
i
had
a
notion
to
ask
him
if
he
knew
john
steele
but
hung
up
instead
there
was
no
use
in
banging
my
head
against
the
air
force
wall
the
next
day
i
decided
to
analyze
the
mantell
case
from
beginning
to
end
it
looked
like
the
key
to
one
angle
the
question
of
an
air
force
secret
missile
unless
there
was
some
so
that
mantell
and
his
pilots
had
been
ordered
to
chase
the
disk
by
mistake
then
it
would
be
cold
murder
i
could
believe
any
air
force
officer
would
give
such
an
order
no
matter
how
tremendous
the
secret
to
be
hidden
but
i
was
going
to
find
out
if
possible
chapter
v
for
more
than
two
weeks
i
checked
on
the
godman
field
tragedy
one
fact
stood
out
at
the
start
the
death
of
mantell
had
had
a
profound
effect
on
many
in
the
air
force
a
dozen
times
i
was
told
i
thought
the
saucers
were
a
mantell
was
killed
chasing
that
thing
at
fort
knox
many
ranking
officers
who
had
laughed
at
the
saucer
scare
stopped
scoffing
one
of
these
was
general
sory
smith
now
deputy
director
of
air
force
public
relations
later
in
my
investigation
general
smith
told
me
it
was
the
mantell
case
that
got
me
i
knew
tommy
mantell
very
well
also
colonel
hix
the
at
godman
i
knew
they
were
both
intelligent
men
not
the
kind
to
be
imagining
things
for
fifteen
months
the
air
force
kept
a
silence
meantime
rumors
began
to
spread
one
report
said
that
mantell
had
been
shot
his
body
riddled
with
bullets
his
also
riddled
had
simply
disintegrated
another
rumor
reported
mantell
as
having
been
killed
by
some
mysterious
force
this
same
force
had
also
destroyed
his
fighter
the
air
force
the
rumors
said
had
covered
up
the
truth
by
telling
mantell
family
he
had
blacked
out
from
lack
of
oxygen
checking
the
last
angle
i
found
that
this
was
the
explanation
given
to
mantell
mother
just
after
his
death
she
was
told
by
standiford
field
officers
that
he
had
flown
too
high
in
chasing
the
strange
object
shallet
in
the
saturday
evening
post
articles
described
project
saucer
reconstruction
of
the
case
mantell
was
said
to
have
climbed
up
to
feet
despite
his
firm
decision
to
end
the
chase
at
since
he
carried
no
oxygen
around
feet
shallett
quoted
the
air
force
investigators
mantell
must
have
lost
consciousness
after
this
his
pilotless
plane
climbed
on
up
to
some
feet
then
dived
between
and
feet
shallett
suggested
the
began
to
disintegrate
obviously
from
excessive
speed
the
gleaming
object
that
hypnotized
mantell
into
this
fatal
climb
was
shallett
said
either
the
planet
venus
or
a
navy
research
balloon
the
air
force
project
saucer
report
of
april
released
just
after
the
first
post
article
makes
these
statements
five
minutes
after
mantell
disappeared
from
his
formation
the
two
remaining
planes
returned
to
godman
a
few
minutes
later
one
resumed
the
search
covering
territory
miles
to
the
south
as
high
as
feet
but
found
nothing
subsequent
investigation
revealed
that
mantell
had
probably
blacked
out
at
feet
from
lack
of
oxygen
and
had
died
of
suffocation
before
the
crash
the
mysterious
object
which
the
flyer
chased
to
his
death
was
first
identified
as
the
planet
venus
however
further
probing
showed
the
elevation
and
azimuth
readings
of
venus
and
the
object
at
specified
time
intervals
did
not
coincide
it
is
still
considered
the
venus
explanation
even
though
now
denied
puzzled
me
it
was
plain
that
the
air
force
had
seriously
considered
offering
it
as
the
answer
then
abandoned
it
apparently
someone
had
got
his
signals
mixed
and
let
shallett
use
the
discarded
answer
and
for
some
unknown
reason
the
air
force
had
found
it
imperative
to
deny
the
venus
story
at
once
in
these
first
weeks
of
checking
i
had
run
onto
the
venus
explanation
in
other
cases
several
air
force
officers
repeated
it
so
quickly
that
it
had
the
sound
of
a
stock
alibi
but
in
the
daytime
cases
this
was
almost
ridiculous
i
knew
of
a
few
instances
in
world
war
ii
when
bomber
crews
and
antiaircraft
gunners
had
loosed
a
few
bursts
at
venus
but
this
was
mostly
at
night
when
the
planet
was
at
peak
brilliance
and
more
than
one
gunner
later
admitted
firing
to
relieve
long
hours
of
boredom
since
enemy
planes
did
not
carry
lights
there
was
no
authentic
case
to
my
knowledge
where
plane
or
ground
gunners
actually
believed
venus
was
an
enemy
aircraft
checking
the
astronomer
report
i
read
over
the
concluding
statement
it
simply
could
not
have
been
venus
they
must
have
been
desperate
even
to
suggest
it
in
the
first
place
months
later
in
the
secret
project
saucer
report
released
december
i
found
official
confirmation
of
this
astronomer
opinions
since
it
has
a
peculiar
bearing
on
the
mantell
case
i
am
quoting
it
now
when
venus
is
at
its
greatest
brilliance
it
is
possible
to
see
it
during
daytime
when
one
knows
exactly
where
to
look
but
on
january
venus
was
less
than
half
as
bright
as
its
peak
brilliance
however
under
exceptionally
good
atmospheric
conditions
and
with
the
eye
shielded
from
direct
rays
of
the
sun
venus
might
be
seen
as
an
exceedingly
tiny
bright
point
of
light
however
the
chances
of
looking
at
just
the
right
spot
are
very
few
it
has
been
unofficially
reported
that
the
object
was
a
navy
research
balloon
if
this
can
be
established
it
is
to
be
preferred
as
an
explanation
however
if
one
accepts
the
assumption
that
reports
from
various
other
localities
refer
to
the
same
object
any
such
device
must
have
been
a
good
many
miles
high
to
in
order
to
have
been
seen
clearly
almost
simultaneously
from
places
miles
apart
if
all
reports
were
of
a
single
object
in
the
knowledge
of
this
investigator
no
object
could
have
been
large
enough
and
far
enough
away
for
the
approximate
simultaneous
sightings
it
is
most
unlikely
however
that
so
many
separated
persons
should
at
that
time
have
chanced
on
venus
in
the
daylight
sky
it
seems
therefore
much
more
probable
that
more
than
one
object
was
involved
the
sighting
might
have
included
two
or
more
balloons
or
aircraft
or
they
might
have
included
venus
and
balloons
for
reasons
given
above
the
latter
explanation
seems
more
likely
two
things
stand
out
in
his
report
the
obvious
determination
to
fit
some
explanation
no
matter
how
farfetched
to
the
mantell
sighting
the
impossibility
that
venus
a
tiny
point
of
light
seen
only
with
difficulty
was
the
tremendous
metallic
object
described
by
mantell
and
seen
by
godman
field
officers
with
venus
eliminated
i
went
to
work
on
the
balloon
theory
since
i
had
been
a
balloon
pilot
before
learning
to
fly
planes
this
was
fairly
familiar
ground
shallett
alternate
theory
that
mantell
had
chased
a
navy
research
balloon
was
widely
repeated
by
readers
unfamiliar
with
balloon
operation
few
thought
to
check
the
speeds
heights
and
distances
involved
research
balloons
are
not
powered
they
are
set
free
to
drift
with
the
wind
this
particular
navy
type
is
released
at
a
base
near
minneapolis
the
gas
bag
is
filled
with
only
a
small
per
cent
of
its
helium
capacity
before
the
in
a
routine
flight
the
balloon
ascends
rapidly
to
a
very
high
high
as
feet
by
this
time
the
gas
bag
has
swelled
to
full
size
about
feet
high
and
feet
in
diameter
at
a
set
time
a
device
releases
the
case
of
instruments
under
the
balloon
the
instruments
descend
by
parachute
and
the
balloon
rising
quickly
explodes
from
the
sudden
expansion
occasionally
a
balloon
starts
leaking
and
it
then
remains
relatively
low
at
first
glance
this
might
seem
the
answer
to
the
kentucky
sightings
if
the
balloon
were
low
enough
it
would
loom
up
as
a
large
circular
object
as
seen
from
directly
below
some
witnesses
might
estimate
its
diameter
as
feet
or
more
instead
of
its
actual
feet
but
this
failure
to
recognize
a
balloon
would
require
incredibly
poor
vision
on
the
part
of
trained
observers
state
police
army
the
godman
field
officers
mantell
and
his
pilots
captain
mantell
was
a
wartime
pilot
with
over
three
thousand
hours
in
the
air
he
was
trained
to
identify
a
distant
enemy
plane
in
a
split
second
his
vision
was
perfect
and
so
was
that
of
his
pilots
in
broad
daylight
they
could
not
fail
to
recognize
a
balloon
during
their
chase
colonel
hix
and
the
other
godman
officers
watched
the
object
with
glasses
for
long
periods
it
is
incredible
that
they
would
not
identify
it
as
a
balloon
before
its
appearance
over
godman
field
the
leaking
balloon
would
have
drifted
at
a
low
altitude
over
several
hundred
miles
a
leak
large
enough
to
bring
it
down
from
high
altitude
would
have
caused
it
to
land
and
be
found
drifting
at
a
low
altitude
it
would
have
been
seen
by
several
hundred
thousand
people
at
the
very
least
many
would
have
reported
it
as
a
balloon
but
even
if
this
angle
is
ignored
it
still
could
not
possibly
have
been
a
balloon
at
low
altitude
the
fast
flight
from
madisonville
the
abrupt
stop
and
hovering
at
godman
field
the
quick
bursts
of
speed
mantell
reported
make
it
impossible
to
fly
the
go
miles
from
madisonville
to
fort
knox
in
minutes
a
balloon
would
require
a
wind
of
after
traveling
at
this
hurricane
speed
it
would
then
have
had
to
come
to
a
dead
stop
above
godman
field
as
the
approached
it
would
have
had
to
speed
tip
again
to
then
to
more
than
to
keep
ahead
of
mantell
the
three
fighter
pilots
chased
the
mysterious
object
for
half
an
hour
i
have
several
times
chased
balloons
with
a
plane
overtaking
them
in
seconds
in
a
straight
chase
mantell
would
have
been
closing
in
at
the
tail
wind
acting
on
his
fighter
would
nullify
the
balloon
forward
drift
but
even
if
you
accept
these
improbable
factors
there
is
one
final
fact
that
nullifies
the
balloon
explanation
the
strange
object
had
disappeared
when
mantell
wingman
searched
the
sky
just
after
the
leader
death
if
it
had
been
a
balloon
held
stationary
for
an
hour
at
a
high
altitude
and
glowing
brightly
enough
to
be
seen
through
clouds
it
would
have
remained
visible
in
the
same
general
position
seen
from
feet
it
would
have
been
even
brighter
because
of
the
clearer
air
but
the
mysterious
object
had
completely
vanished
in
those
few
minutes
a
search
covering
a
hundred
miles
failed
to
reveal
a
trace
whether
at
a
high
or
low
altitude
a
balloon
could
not
have
escaped
the
pilot
eyes
it
would
also
have
continued
to
be
seen
at
godman
field
and
other
points
through
occasional
breaks
in
the
clouds
i
pointed
out
these
facts
to
one
air
force
officer
at
the
pentagon
next
day
he
phoned
me
i
figured
it
out
the
timing
device
went
off
and
the
balloon
exploded
that
why
the
pilot
did
see
it
it
an
odd
coincidence
i
said
that
it
exploded
in
those
five
minutes
after
mantell
last
report
even
so
it
obviously
the
answer
he
said
checking
on
this
angle
i
found
no
one
in
the
kentucky
area
had
reported
a
descending
parachute
no
research
instrument
case
or
parachute
was
found
in
the
area
no
instruments
were
returned
to
the
navy
from
this
region
and
all
balloons
and
instruments
released
at
that
time
were
fully
accounted
for
even
if
it
had
been
a
balloon
it
would
not
explain
the
later
january
reports
the
simultaneous
sightings
mentioned
by
professor
hynek
in
the
project
saucer
report
this
includes
the
thing
seen
at
lockbourne
air
force
base
two
hours
after
mantell
death
obviously
the
saucer
seen
flying
at
over
lockbourne
field
could
not
have
been
a
balloon
even
if
there
had
been
several
balloons
in
this
area
and
there
were
not
by
official
record
they
could
not
have
covered
the
courses
reported
in
some
cases
they
would
have
been
flying
against
the
wind
at
terrific
speed
then
what
was
the
mysterious
object
and
what
killed
mantell
both
the
air
force
and
the
post
articles
speculate
that
mantell
carelessly
let
himself
black
out
since
some
explanation
had
to
be
given
this
might
seem
a
good
answer
but
mantell
was
known
for
coolheaded
judgment
as
a
wartime
pilot
he
was
familiar
with
signs
of
anoxia
oxygen
starvation
that
he
knew
his
tolerance
for
altitude
is
proved
by
his
firmly
declared
intention
to
abandon
the
chase
at
feet
since
he
had
no
oxygen
equipment
mantell
had
his
altimeter
to
warn
him
from
experience
he
would
recognize
the
first
vague
blurring
narrowing
of
vision
and
other
signs
of
anoxia
despite
this
the
blackout
explanation
was
accepted
as
plausible
by
many
americans
while
investigating
the
mantell
case
i
talked
with
several
pilots
and
aeronautical
engineers
several
questioned
that
a
starting
a
dive
from
feet
would
have
disintegrated
so
thoroughly
from
thirty
thousand
feet
yes
said
one
engineer
if
the
idea
was
to
explain
it
away
i
pick
a
high
altitude
to
start
from
but
a
pilotless
plane
does
necessarily
dive
as
you
know
it
might
slip
off
and
spin
or
spiral
down
and
a
few
have
even
landed
themselves
also
if
the
plane
started
down
from
twenty
thousand
the
pilot
would
be
too
far
blacked
out
the
odds
are
come
to
when
he
got
into
thicker
air
admitting
he
did
blur
out
which
is
only
an
air
force
guess
i
do
see
why
they
so
positive
mantell
died
before
he
hit
the
ground
unless
they
know
something
we
do
one
of
the
pilot
group
put
it
more
bluntly
it
looks
like
a
to
me
i
think
mantell
did
just
what
he
said
he
would
close
in
on
the
thing
i
think
he
either
collided
with
it
or
more
likely
they
knocked
him
out
of
the
air
they
think
he
was
trying
to
bring
them
down
barging
in
like
that
even
if
you
accept
the
blackout
answer
it
still
does
not
explain
what
mantell
was
chasing
it
is
possible
that
excited
by
the
huge
mysterious
object
he
recklessly
climbed
beyond
the
danger
level
though
such
an
act
was
completely
at
odds
with
his
character
but
the
identity
of
the
thing
remains
officially
a
mystery
if
it
was
some
weird
experimental
craft
or
a
guided
missile
then
whose
was
it
air
force
officers
had
repeatedly
told
me
they
had
no
such
device
general
carl
touhy
spaatz
former
air
force
chief
had
publicly
insisted
that
no
such
weapon
had
been
developed
in
his
regime
secretary
symington
and
general
hoyt
vandenberg
present
air
force
chief
had
been
equally
emphatic
of
course
official
denials
could
be
expected
if
it
were
a
secret
but
if
it
were
a
secret
device
would
it
be
tested
so
publicly
that
thousands
would
see
it
if
it
were
an
air
force
device
then
i
could
see
only
one
answer
for
the
godman
field
incident
the
thing
was
such
a
closely
guarded
secret
that
even
colonel
hix
had
known
that
would
mean
that
most
or
all
air
force
base
were
also
in
ignorance
of
the
secret
device
could
it
be
a
navy
experiment
kept
secret
from
the
air
force
i
did
a
little
checking
admiral
calvin
bolster
chief
of
aeronautics
research
experimental
craft
was
an
annapolis
classmate
of
mine
so
was
captain
delmer
fahrney
head
of
the
navy
program
fahrney
was
at
point
mugu
base
in
california
and
i
was
able
to
see
him
but
i
knew
him
as
a
careful
conscientious
officer
i
believe
he
would
let
such
a
device
piloted
or
not
hover
over
an
air
force
base
with
no
warning
to
its
i
saw
admiral
bolster
his
denial
seemed
genuine
unless
he
got
to
be
a
poker
player
since
our
earlier
days
i
was
sure
he
was
telling
the
truth
the
only
other
alternate
was
russia
it
was
incredible
that
they
would
develop
such
a
device
and
then
expose
it
to
the
gaze
of
air
force
officers
it
could
be
photographed
its
speed
and
maneuverability
checked
it
might
crash
or
antiaircraft
fire
might
bring
it
down
the
secret
might
be
lost
in
one
such
test
flight
there
was
one
other
explanation
the
thing
was
not
intended
to
be
seen
it
had
got
out
of
control
in
this
event
the
long
hovering
period
at
godman
field
was
caused
by
the
need
for
repairs
inside
the
flying
saucer
or
repairs
to
apparatus
if
it
were
air
force
or
navy
that
would
explain
official
concern
even
if
completely
free
of
negligence
the
service
responsible
would
be
blamed
for
mantell
death
if
it
were
russian
the
air
force
would
of
course
try
to
conceal
the
fact
for
fear
of
public
hysteria
but
if
the
device
was
american
it
meant
that
project
saucer
was
a
unit
while
pretending
to
investigate
it
would
actually
hush
up
reports
make
false
explanations
and
safeguard
the
secret
in
every
possible
way
also
the
reported
order
for
air
force
pilots
to
pursue
the
disks
would
have
to
be
a
fake
instead
there
would
be
a
secret
order
telling
them
to
avoid
strange
objects
in
the
sky
by
the
time
i
finished
my
i
was
sure
of
one
thing
this
particular
saucer
had
been
real
i
was
almost
positive
of
one
other
the
thing
had
been
over
miles
high
during
part
of
its
flight
i
found
that
after
death
it
was
reported
simultaneously
from
madisonville
elizabethtown
and
lexington
over
a
distance
of
miles
professor
analysis
later
confirmed
this
how
low
it
had
been
while
hovering
over
godman
and
during
chase
there
was
no
way
to
determine
but
all
the
evidence
pointed
to
a
swift
ascent
after
mantell
last
report
had
mantell
told
godman
tower
more
than
the
air
force
admitted
i
went
back
to
the
pentagon
and
asked
for
a
full
transcript
of
the
flight
leader
radio
messages
i
got
a
quick
the
reports
i
was
told
were
still
classified
as
secret
requests
for
pictures
of
the
wreckage
and
for
a
report
on
the
condition
of
mantell
body
also
drew
a
blank
i
had
heard
that
some
photographs
were
taken
of
the
godman
field
saucer
from
outside
the
tower
but
the
air
force
denied
knowledge
of
any
such
pictures
puzzling
over
the
riddle
i
remembered
john
steele
the
former
intelligence
captain
if
by
any
chance
he
was
a
plant
it
would
be
interesting
to
suggest
the
various
answers
and
watch
his
reaction
when
i
phoned
him
to
suggest
luncheon
steele
accepted
at
once
we
met
at
the
occidental
on
pennsylvania
avenue
steele
was
younger
than
i
had
expected
not
over
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
crew
haircut
and
the
build
of
a
football
player
looking
at
him
the
first
time
i
expected
a
certain
breeziness
instead
he
was
almost
solemn
i
owe
you
an
apology
he
said
in
a
careful
voice
after
we
ordered
you
probably
know
i
a
syndicate
writer
i
wondered
if
he
found
out
jack
daly
was
checking
on
him
when
you
mentioned
the
press
club
i
said
i
gathered
you
were
in
the
business
i
afraid
you
thought
i
was
fishing
for
a
lead
steele
looked
at
me
earnestly
i
not
working
on
the
story
i
tied
up
on
other
stuff
forget
it
i
told
him
he
seemed
anxious
to
reassure
me
i
been
worried
for
some
time
about
the
saucers
i
called
you
that
night
on
an
impulse
glad
you
did
i
said
i
need
every
tip
i
can
get
did
it
help
you
any
yes
though
it
still
does
fit
together
but
i
can
tell
you
this
the
saucers
are
real
or
at
least
one
of
them
which
one
the
thing
captain
mantell
was
chasing
near
fort
knox
before
he
died
oh
that
one
steele
looked
down
at
the
roll
he
was
buttering
i
thought
that
case
was
fully
explained
was
he
chasing
a
balloon
the
air
force
says
it
still
unidentified
i
told
him
what
i
had
learned
apparently
you
right
it
either
an
american
or
a
soviet
missile
after
what
you
told
me
said
steele
i
ca
believe
it
ours
it
must
be
russian
they
be
pretty
stupid
to
test
it
over
here
you
said
it
was
probably
out
of
control
that
particular
one
maybe
but
there
have
been
several
hundred
seen
over
here
if
they
found
their
controls
were
haywire
they
keep
testing
the
things
until
they
corrected
that
the
waiter
came
with
the
soup
and
steele
was
silent
until
he
left
i
still
ca
believe
it
our
weapon
he
said
slowly
they
would
have
air
force
pilots
alerted
to
chase
the
things
and
i
happen
to
how
they
do
there
something
queer
about
this
missile
angle
i
said
that
saucer
was
seen
at
the
same
time
by
people
a
hundred
and
miles
apart
to
be
that
high
in
the
sky
and
still
look
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
diameter
it
must
have
been
enormous
steele
did
answer
for
a
moment
obviously
that
was
an
illusion
he
finally
answered
i
discount
those
estimates
even
mantell
and
the
godman
field
officers
not
knowing
the
thing
height
how
could
they
judge
accurately
to
be
seen
at
points
that
far
apart
it
had
to
be
over
thirty
miles
high
i
told
him
it
would
have
to
be
huge
to
show
up
at
all
he
shook
his
head
i
ca
believe
those
reports
are
right
it
must
have
been
sighted
at
different
times
i
let
it
drop
what
are
you
working
on
now
steele
asked
after
a
minute
or
two
i
said
i
had
decided
actually
i
planned
a
trip
to
the
coast
to
interview
pilots
who
had
sighted
flying
disks
what
would
you
do
if
you
found
it
was
a
soviet
missile
said
steele
he
sounded
almost
too
casual
if
security
was
involved
i
keep
still
but
the
air
force
and
the
navy
swear
they
have
any
such
things
steele
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
you
know
true
might
force
something
into
the
open
that
would
be
better
left
secret
he
smiled
ironically
i
realize
that
sounds
peculiar
since
i
suggested
the
russian
angle
but
if
it
russian
though
i
still
think
it
is
then
we
have
nothing
to
worry
about
i
was
almost
sure
now
that
he
was
a
plant
during
the
rest
of
the
luncheon
i
tried
to
draw
him
out
but
steele
was
through
talking
when
we
parted
he
gave
me
a
sober
warning
you
and
true
should
consider
your
moral
responsibility
no
matter
what
you
find
even
if
it
not
actual
security
there
may
be
reasons
to
keep
still
after
he
left
me
i
tried
to
figure
it
out
if
the
air
force
was
back
of
this
they
must
not
think
much
of
my
intelligence
or
else
they
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
a
line
on
true
investigation
that
they
had
no
choice
but
to
use
steele
of
course
it
was
still
possible
he
was
doing
this
on
his
own
either
way
his
purpose
was
obvious
he
hoped
to
have
us
swallow
the
answer
if
we
did
then
we
would
have
to
keep
still
even
though
we
found
absolute
proof
obviously
it
would
be
dangerous
to
print
that
story
thinking
back
i
recalled
steele
apparent
attempt
to
dismiss
the
mantell
case
i
was
convinced
now
the
godman
field
affair
must
hold
an
important
clue
that
i
had
overlooked
it
might
even
be
the
key
to
the
whole
flying
saucer
riddle
chapter
vi
shortly
after
my
talk
with
steele
i
flew
to
the
coast
for
three
weeks
i
investigated
sightings
that
had
been
reported
by
airline
and
private
pilots
and
other
competent
witnesses
at
first
the
airline
pilots
were
reluctant
to
talk
most
of
them
remembered
the
ridicule
that
had
followed
published
accounts
by
other
airline
men
one
pilot
told
me
he
had
been
ordered
to
keep
still
about
his
experience
whether
by
the
company
or
the
air
force
he
would
not
say
but
most
of
them
finally
agreed
to
talk
if
i
kept
their
names
out
of
print
one
airline
captain
i
call
him
blake
had
encountered
a
saucer
at
night
he
and
his
copilot
had
sighted
the
object
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
half
a
mile
to
their
left
we
were
at
about
twelve
thousand
feet
he
said
when
we
saw
this
thing
pacing
us
it
did
have
any
running
lights
but
we
could
see
the
moonlight
reflecting
from
something
like
bright
metal
there
was
a
glow
along
the
side
like
some
kind
of
light
or
exhaust
could
you
make
out
the
shape
i
asked
blake
grinned
crookedly
you
think
we
did
try
i
cut
in
toward
it
it
turned
in
the
same
direction
i
pulled
up
about
three
hundred
feet
and
it
did
the
same
finally
i
opened
my
throttles
and
cut
in
fast
intending
to
pull
tip
if
we
got
too
close
i
need
have
worried
the
thing
let
out
a
burst
of
reddish
flame
and
streaked
up
out
of
sight
it
was
gone
in
a
few
seconds
then
it
must
have
been
piloted
i
said
if
not
it
had
some
kind
of
unit
to
make
it
veer
off
when
anything
got
near
it
it
matched
every
move
i
made
until
the
last
one
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
the
saucer
was
blake
hesitated
then
he
gave
me
a
slow
grin
well
my
copilot
thinks
it
was
a
space
ship
he
says
no
pilot
here
on
earth
could
take
that
many
g
when
the
thing
zoomed
i
heard
some
men
from
mars
opinions
about
the
saucers
but
this
was
an
experienced
pilot
you
do
believe
that
i
said
no
blake
said
i
figure
it
was
some
new
type
of
guided
missile
if
it
took
as
many
g
as
chuck
my
copilot
thinks
then
it
must
have
been
on
a
beam
and
later
i
found
two
other
pilots
who
had
the
same
idea
as
chuck
one
captain
was
afraid
the
flying
saucers
were
russian
his
copilot
thought
they
were
air
force
or
navy
i
met
one
airline
official
who
was
indignant
about
testing
such
missiles
near
the
airways
even
if
they
do
have
some
device
to
make
them
veer
off
he
said
i
think
it
a
risk
there
be
hell
to
pay
if
one
ever
hits
an
airliner
they
been
flying
around
for
two
years
a
line
pilot
pointed
out
nobody
had
a
close
call
yet
i
do
think
there
much
danger
when
i
left
the
coast
i
flew
to
new
york
ken
purdy
called
in
john
dubarry
true
aviation
editor
to
hear
the
details
purdy
called
him
john
the
skeptic
after
i
told
them
what
i
had
learned
purdy
nodded
what
do
you
think
the
saucers
are
asked
dubarry
they
must
be
guided
missiles
i
said
but
it
leaves
some
queer
gaps
in
the
picture
i
had
made
up
a
list
of
possible
answers
and
i
read
it
to
them
one
the
saucers
do
exist
they
caused
by
mistakes
hysteria
and
so
on
two
they
russian
guided
missiles
three
american
guided
missiles
four
the
whole
thing
is
a
hoax
a
trick
you
mean
a
trick
of
ours
said
purdy
sure
to
make
the
soviets
think
we
could
reach
them
with
a
guided
missile
but
i
do
think
that
the
answer
i
just
listed
it
as
a
possibility
dubarry
considered
this
thoughtfully
in
the
first
place
you
have
to
bring
thousands
of
people
into
the
scheme
so
the
disks
would
be
reported
often
enough
to
get
publicity
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
device
maybe
something
launched
from
highflying
bombers
to
give
the
rumors
substance
certainly
do
a
better
job
than
this
to
put
it
over
and
it
explain
the
sightings
also
captain
mantell
would
kill
himself
just
to
carry
out
an
official
hoax
john
right
said
purdy
anyway
it
too
ponderous
it
would
leak
like
a
sieve
and
the
dumbest
soviet
agent
would
see
through
it
he
looked
back
at
my
list
cross
off
number
one
there
too
much
competent
testimony
beside
the
obvious
fact
that
something
being
covered
up
that
leaves
russian
or
american
missiles
i
said
as
steele
first
suggested
but
there
are
some
points
that
just
wo
fit
the
missile
theory
you
left
out
one
answer
said
purdy
what
that
interplanetary
you
kidding
i
said
i
did
say
i
believed
it
said
purdy
i
just
say
it
possible
dubarry
was
watching
me
i
know
how
you
feel
that
how
it
hit
me
when
ken
first
said
it
i
heard
it
before
i
said
but
i
never
took
it
seriously
maybe
this
will
interest
you
purdy
said
he
gave
me
a
note
from
sam
boal
just
talked
with
d
the
note
ran
d
is
a
prominent
aeronautical
engineer
the
designer
of
a
plane
he
believes
the
disks
may
be
interplanetary
and
that
the
air
force
knows
it
or
at
least
suspects
it
i
enclosing
sketches
showing
how
he
thinks
the
disks
operate
he
not
the
first
one
who
told
us
that
said
purdy
we
heard
the
same
thing
from
other
engineers
over
a
dozen
airline
pilots
think
they
coining
from
out
in
space
and
there
a
rocket
expert
at
wright
field
who
warned
project
that
the
things
are
interplanetary
that
why
i
not
writing
it
off
have
you
read
the
project
ideas
on
space
travel
dubarry
asked
me
i
told
him
my
copy
had
reached
me
he
read
me
some
marked
paragraphs
in
his
copy
of
the
preliminary
report
has
been
speculation
that
the
aerial
phenomena
might
actually
be
some
form
of
penetration
from
another
planet
the
existence
of
intelligent
life
on
mars
is
not
impossible
but
is
completely
unproven
the
possibility
of
intelligent
life
on
the
planet
venus
is
not
considered
completely
unreasonable
by
astronomers
scientists
concede
that
living
organisms
might
develop
in
chemical
environments
which
are
strange
to
us
in
the
next
fifty
years
we
will
almost
certainly
start
exploring
space
the
chance
of
space
travelers
existing
at
planets
attached
to
neighboring
stars
is
very
much
greater
than
the
chance
of
martians
the
one
can
be
viewed
as
almost
a
certainty
dubarry
handed
me
the
report
here
i
practically
know
it
by
heart
take
it
with
you
you
can
send
it
back
later
i
know
the
idea
sounds
silly
at
first
said
purdy
but
it
the
only
answer
that
explains
all
the
those
in
the
last
century
he
asked
dubarry
to
give
me
their
file
of
historic
reports
while
john
was
getting
it
purdy
went
on
be
careful
about
this
man
steele
after
what
he
said
about
responsibility
i
sure
he
planted
i
thought
back
to
steele
warning
i
told
purdy
if
he
had
the
space
thing
in
mind
maybe
he
right
it
could
set
off
a
panic
that
would
make
that
orson
welles
thing
look
like
a
picnic
certainly
it
could
purdy
said
we
have
to
handle
it
it
turned
out
to
be
the
truth
but
i
think
the
air
force
is
making
a
mistake
if
that
what
they
hiding
it
could
break
the
wrong
way
and
be
serious
john
dubarry
came
back
with
the
file
of
old
reports
it
might
interest
you
to
know
he
said
that
the
air
force
checked
all
these
old
sightings
too
the
idea
was
still
a
difficult
one
for
me
to
believe
those
suggestions
might
be
a
trick
i
said
the
air
force
may
be
hinting
at
that
to
hide
the
secret
yes
but
later
on
they
deny
the
space
thing
said
purdy
it
looks
as
if
they
trying
to
put
people
on
guard
and
then
play
it
down
so
they
wo
get
scared
as
i
put
the
historic
reports
file
in
my
brief
case
purdy
handed
me
a
letter
from
an
investigator
named
hilton
who
had
been
working
in
the
southwest
i
skimmed
over
his
letter
hilton
had
heard
of
some
unusual
night
sightings
in
new
mexico
the
story
had
been
hushed
up
but
he
had
learned
some
details
from
a
pilot
at
albuquerque
one
of
these
mysterious
flying
lights
had
been
seen
at
las
vegas
on
december
just
one
month
before
mantell
was
killed
in
kentucky
it
was
too
dark
to
make
out
the
shape
behind
the
light
but
all
witnesses
had
agreed
on
its
performance
the
thing
had
climbed
at
tremendous
speed
its
upward
motion
shown
by
a
bright
green
light
though
the
green
glow
was
much
brighter
than
a
plane
running
light
all
plane
schedules
were
carefully
checked
i
think
they
were
trying
to
pin
it
on
a
jet
fighter
the
albuquerque
pilot
told
hilton
but
there
were
any
jets
near
there
anyway
the
thing
climbed
too
fast
it
must
have
been
making
close
to
nine
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
air
force
had
also
checked
balloon
release
times
apparently
just
for
the
record
since
no
balloon
could
even
approach
the
terrific
ascent
again
they
drew
a
blank
from
the
way
this
was
hushed
up
hilton
commented
they
seem
to
be
worried
about
this
group
of
sightings
i
heard
two
reports
that
the
is
tied
into
the
deal
somehow
but
that
as
far
as
i
can
get
see
if
you
can
get
any
lead
on
that
purdy
told
me
that
business
puzzles
me
where
would
they
come
in
i
said
i
would
try
to
find
out
but
it
was
almost
four
months
before
we
learned
the
answer
the
men
had
been
witnesses
this
was
later
admitted
in
an
obscure
in
the
final
project
saucer
report
but
all
official
answers
to
the
strange
sightings
had
been
carefully
omitted
the
cases
concerned
were
and
which
will
be
discussed
later
when
you
go
back
to
washington
said
purdy
see
what
reaction
you
get
to
the
interplanetary
idea
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
what
the
reaction
would
be
but
i
nodded
i
go
flag
a
space
ship
and
be
on
my
way
gag
it
up
said
purdy
but
do
sell
it
short
if
by
any
chance
it
true
it
be
the
biggest
story
since
the
birth
of
christ
chapter
vii
it
was
dark
when
the
airliner
limousine
reached
la
guardia
field
i
had
intended
taking
an
earlier
plane
but
dubarry
persuaded
me
to
stay
over
for
dinner
we
dropped
into
the
algonquin
next
door
to
true
office
building
halfway
through
dinner
i
asked
john
what
he
thought
of
the
answer
oh
it
possible
he
said
cautiously
the
time
and
space
angles
make
it
hard
to
take
but
if
we
planning
to
explore
space
within
fifty
years
there
no
reason
some
other
planet
people
could
do
it
of
course
if
they
been
observing
us
for
over
a
century
as
those
old
sightings
seem
to
indicate
they
must
be
far
ahead
of
us
at
least
in
technical
progress
later
on
he
said
thoughtfully
even
though
it
possible
i
hate
to
think
it
the
answer
just
imagine
the
impact
on
the
world
we
have
to
reorient
our
whole
lives
and
things
are
complicated
enough
already
standing
at
the
gate
waiting
for
my
plane
to
be
called
i
thought
over
that
angle
assuming
that
space
travel
was
the
solution
which
i
still
could
would
be
the
effect
on
the
world
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
picture
so
much
depended
on
the
visitors
from
space
what
would
their
purpose
be
would
they
be
peaceful
or
hostile
why
had
they
been
observing
the
earth
so
intensively
in
the
past
few
years
i
could
think
of
a
hundred
questions
what
would
the
space
people
be
like
would
they
be
similar
to
men
and
women
on
earth
or
some
fearsome
buck
rogerish
creatures
who
would
terrify
the
average
american
including
myself
it
was
obvious
they
would
be
far
superior
to
us
in
many
ways
but
their
civilization
might
be
entirely
different
evolution
might
have
developed
their
minds
and
possibly
their
bodies
along
lines
we
could
even
grasp
perhaps
we
could
even
communicate
with
them
what
would
be
the
net
effect
of
making
contact
with
beings
from
a
distant
planet
would
earthlings
be
terrified
or
if
it
seemed
a
peaceful
exploration
would
we
bc
intrigued
by
the
thought
of
a
great
adventure
it
would
depend
entirely
on
the
space
visitors
motives
and
how
the
world
was
prepared
for
such
a
revelation
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
fantastic
thc
thing
seemed
and
yet
it
had
been
too
long
since
airplane
flight
was
considered
an
idiot
dream
this
scene
here
at
la
guardia
would
have
seemed
pure
fantasy
in
thc
huge
constellations
and
the
stratocruisers
sweeping
in
from
all
over
the
country
the
big
ships
at
taking
off
for
points
all
over
the
globe
we
come
a
long
way
in
the
years
since
the
wright
brothers
first
flight
but
space
travel
the
gateman
checked
my
ticket
and
i
went
out
to
the
washington
plane
it
was
a
luxury
ship
a
scheduled
to
be
in
the
capital
one
hour
after
by
morning
this
plane
the
aztec
would
be
in
mexico
city
the
couple
going
up
the
gangway
ahead
of
me
were
in
their
late
sixties
fifty
years
ago
what
would
they
have
said
if
someone
had
predicted
this
flight
the
answer
to
that
was
easy
at
that
time
songbooks
featured
a
piece
entitled
darius
green
and
his
flying
machine
darius
it
seems
was
a
lad
who
actually
thought
he
could
fly
fifty
years
that
was
the
time
the
air
force
had
estimated
it
would
take
us
to
start
exploring
space
would
americans
come
to
accept
space
travel
as
as
the
people
now
boarding
this
plane
the
youngsters
would
probably
the
older
ones
as
a
rule
would
be
a
little
more
cautious
in
the
oval
lounge
at
the
rear
of
the
plane
i
took
out
the
file
of
old
sighting
reports
glancing
through
it
i
saw
excerpts
from
astronomical
and
scientific
journals
and
extracts
from
official
gazettes
most
of
the
early
sightings
had
been
in
great
britain
and
on
the
continent
with
a
few
reports
scattered
around
the
world
the
american
reports
did
not
begin
until
the
latter
part
of
the
century
the
rolled
out
and
took
off
for
a
few
minutes
i
watched
the
lights
of
manhattan
and
greater
new
york
twinkling
below
the
empire
state
building
tower
was
still
above
us
as
the
plane
banked
over
the
east
river
we
climbed
quickly
and
the
familiar
outline
of
manhattan
took
shape
like
a
map
with
millions
of
lights
any
large
city
seen
from
the
air
at
night
has
a
certain
magic
new
york
most
of
all
looking
down
i
thought
what
would
a
spaceman
think
seeing
this
brilliantly
lighted
city
the
towering
skyscrapers
would
other
planets
have
such
cities
or
would
it
be
something
new
and
puzzling
to
a
visitor
from
space
turning
back
to
the
old
reports
i
skipped
through
until
i
found
the
american
sightings
one
of
the
first
was
an
incident
at
bonham
texas
in
the
summer
of
it
was
broad
daylight
when
a
strange
object
appeared
in
the
sky
southwest
of
the
town
for
a
moment
the
people
of
bonham
stared
at
the
thing
not
believing
their
eves
the
only
flying
device
then
known
was
the
drifting
balloon
but
this
thing
was
tremendous
and
speeding
so
fast
its
outlines
were
almost
a
blur
terrified
farmers
dived
under
their
wagons
townspeople
fled
indoors
only
a
few
hardy
souls
remained
in
the
streets
the
mysterious
object
circled
bonham
twice
then
raced
off
to
the
cast
and
vanished
descriptions
of
the
strange
machine
varied
from
round
or
oval
to
the
details
of
the
bonham
sighting
were
later
confirmed
for
me
by
frank
edwards
mutual
network
newscaster
who
investigated
this
case
hours
after
the
bonham
incident
a
device
of
the
same
description
appeared
at
fort
scott
kansas
soldiers
fled
the
parade
ground
as
the
thing
flashed
overhead
in
a
few
seconds
it
disappeared
circling
toward
the
north
until
now
i
had
supposed
that
the
term
saucer
was
original
with
kenneth
arnold
actually
the
first
to
compare
a
flying
object
with
a
saucer
was
john
martin
a
farmer
who
lived
near
denison
texas
the
denison
daily
news
of
january
gives
the
following
account
from
john
martin
a
farmer
who
lives
some
six
miles
south
of
this
city
we
learn
the
following
strange
story
tuesday
morning
while
out
hunting
his
attention
was
directed
to
a
dark
object
high
up
in
the
southern
sky
the
peculiar
shape
and
velocity
with
which
the
object
seemed
to
approach
riveted
his
attention
and
he
strained
his
eves
to
discover
its
character
when
first
noticed
it
appeared
to
be
about
the
size
of
an
orange
which
continued
to
grow
in
size
after
gazing
at
it
for
some
time
martin
became
blind
from
long
looking
and
left
off
viewing
it
for
a
time
in
order
to
rest
his
eyes
on
resuming
his
view
the
object
was
almost
overhead
and
had
increased
considerably
in
size
and
appeared
to
be
going
through
space
at
wonderful
speed
when
directly
over
him
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
large
saucer
and
was
evidently
at
great
height
martin
thought
it
resembled
as
well
as
he
could
judge
a
balloon
it
went
as
rapidly
as
it
had
come
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
in
the
heavenly
skies
martin
is
a
gentleman
of
undoubted
veracity
and
this
strange
occurrence
if
it
was
not
a
balloon
deserves
the
attention
of
our
scientists
in
the
file
i
saw
a
memo
dubarry
had
written
i
would
take
the
very
early
reports
with
caution
for
instance
the
one
on
august
which
describes
an
odd
body
traveling
at
high
speed
toward
the
sun
i
recall
that
charles
fort
accepted
this
along
with
other
early
sightings
as
evidence
of
space
ships
but
this
particular
thing
might
have
been
a
meteor
meteors
as
such
were
almost
unknown
then
the
later
reports
are
more
convincing
and
it
is
also
easier
to
check
the
sources
especially
those
from
on
from
to
the
reports
were
meager
some
described
mysterious
lights
in
the
sky
a
few
mentioned
round
objects
seen
in
daylight
even
though
they
were
not
so
fully
documented
as
later
ones
one
point
struck
me
in
those
days
there
was
no
telegraph
telephone
or
radio
to
spread
news
rapidly
and
start
a
flood
of
rumors
a
sighting
in
scotland
could
not
be
the
cause
of
a
similar
one
two
days
later
in
the
south
of
france
beginning
in
there
was
a
series
of
reports
that
went
on
to
the
turn
of
the
century
in
the
london
times
september
there
was
a
description
of
a
queer
object
that
was
seen
crossing
the
moon
it
was
reported
as
elliptical
with
some
kind
of
tail
and
it
took
almost
thirty
seconds
to
complete
its
passage
of
the
moon
then
in
a
large
round
body
was
sighted
above
marseilles
france
this
was
on
august
it
moved
slowly
across
the
sky
apparently
at
great
height
and
was
visible
about
fifteen
minutes
on
march
several
brilliantly
luminous
objects
were
reported
seen
at
kattenau
germany
sighted
just
before
sunrise
they
were
described
as
rising
from
the
horizon
and
moving
from
east
to
west
the
account
was
published
in
the
british
nature
magazine
volume
page
the
next
report
in
the
file
mentioned
briefly
a
strange
round
object
seen
in
the
skies
over
bermuda
the
source
for
this
account
was
the
bermuda
royal
gazette
this
was
in
that
same
year
an
astronomer
and
other
witnesses
reported
a
gigantic
aerial
object
at
adrianople
turkey
on
november
the
weird
apparition
was
seen
moving
across
the
sky
observers
described
it
as
round
and
four
to
five
times
the
size
of
the
moon
this
estimate
is
similar
to
the
denison
texas
comparison
with
an
orange
the
object
would
actually
be
huge
to
be
seen
at
any
great
height
but
unless
the
true
height
were
known
any
estimate
of
size
would
be
guesswork
on
march
two
strange
objects
fell
into
the
sea
near
a
dutch
barkentine
as
described
by
the
skipper
captain
sweet
one
of
the
objects
was
dark
the
other
brightly
luminous
the
glowing
object
fell
with
a
loud
roaring
sound
the
shipmaster
was
positive
it
was
not
a
meteor
in
new
zealand
a
year
later
an
disk
was
reported
speeding
high
overhead
this
was
on
may
about
two
years
after
this
several
large
aerial
bodies
were
sighted
hovering
over
the
dutch
east
indies
most
accounts
described
them
as
roughly
triangular
about
one
hundred
feet
on
the
base
and
two
hundred
feet
on
the
sides
but
some
observers
thought
they
might
be
longer
and
narrower
with
a
rounded
base
this
would
make
them
agree
with
more
recent
stories
of
objects
with
rounded
tops
seen
in
american
skies
on
august
a
british
admiral
reported
sighting
a
large
disk
with
a
projection
like
a
tail
and
a
year
after
this
both
england
and
scotland
buzzed
with
stories
of
objects
like
those
seen
in
the
dutch
east
indies
although
many
officials
scoffed
at
the
stories
more
than
one
astronomer
stuck
to
his
belief
that
the
mysterious
things
might
be
coming
from
outer
space
since
planes
and
dirigibles
were
then
unknown
there
was
no
one
on
earth
who
could
have
been
responsible
for
them
in
sightings
in
the
united
states
began
to
be
more
frequent
one
of
the
strangest
reports
describes
an
incident
that
began
on
april
flying
at
a
great
height
a
huge
device
was
seen
in
the
midwest
short
wings
projected
from
the
sides
of
the
object
according
to
reports
of
astronomers
who
watched
it
through
telescopes
for
almost
a
week
the
aerial
visitor
was
sighted
around
the
midwest
as
far
south
as
louis
and
as
far
west
as
colorado
several
times
red
green
and
white
lights
were
seen
to
flash
in
the
sky
some
witnesses
thought
the
crew
of
this
strange
craft
might
be
trying
to
signal
the
earth
on
april
the
thing
whatever
it
was
disappeared
from
the
midwest
but
on
april
the
same
object
or
else
a
similar
one
appeared
over
west
virginia
early
that
morning
the
town
of
sisterville
was
awakened
by
blasts
of
the
sawmill
whistle
those
who
went
outside
their
homes
saw
a
strange
sight
from
a
object
overhead
dazzling
searchlights
were
pointing
downward
sweeping
the
countryside
the
thing
appeared
to
be
about
two
hundred
feet
long
some
thirty
feet
in
diameter
with
stubby
wings
and
red
and
green
lights
along
the
sides
for
almost
ten
minutes
the
aerial
visitor
circled
the
town
then
it
swung
eastward
and
vanished
the
next
report
was
published
in
the
weather
bureau
monthly
weather
review
on
page
in
the
march
issue
there
is
an
account
of
an
odd
sighting
at
sea
on
february
a
mysterious
light
had
been
seen
above
the
atlantic
by
crew
members
of
the
supply
it
was
moving
swiftly
and
evidently
at
high
altitude
the
report
was
attested
by
lieutenant
frank
schofield
on
july
a
mysterious
explosion
occurred
in
the
heavens
near
burlington
vermont
some
witnesses
described
a
strange
device
circling
above
shortly
after
it
was
seen
a
round
luminous
object
flashed
down
from
the
sky
then
exploded
weather
review
page
another
craft
was
reported
at
a
low
altitude
over
bridgewater
massachusetts
in
like
the
one
at
sisterville
it
carried
searchlights
which
swept
back
and
forth
across
the
countryside
after
a
few
moments
the
visitor
rose
in
a
steep
climb
and
the
searchlights
blinked
out
there
was
no
report
for
in
america
though
an
odd
aerial
object
was
sighted
near
the
galapagos
islands
but
in
one
january
morning
a
large
silvery
device
startled
chattanooga
after
about
five
minutes
the
thing
sped
away
appearing
over
huntsville
alabama
shortly
afterward
it
made
a
second
appearance
over
chattanooga
the
next
day
then
headed
east
and
was
never
seen
again
in
popular
astronomy
january
a
harris
described
an
intensely
black
object
that
he
saw
crossing
the
moon
as
nearly
as
he
could
tell
it
was
gigantic
in
size
though
again
there
was
no
way
to
be
sure
of
its
distance
from
him
or
the
moon
with
careful
understatement
harris
said
i
think
a
very
interesting
and
curious
phenomenon
happened
that
night
a
strange
shadow
was
noted
on
the
clouds
at
fort
worth
texas
on
april
it
appeared
to
be
caused
by
some
large
body
hovering
motionless
above
the
clouds
as
the
cloud
layer
moved
the
shadow
remained
in
the
same
position
then
it
changed
size
diminishing
and
quickly
disappeared
as
if
it
had
risen
vertically
a
report
on
this
was
given
in
the
weather
bureau
review
of
that
year
number
by
dirigibles
were
of
course
well
known
to
most
of
the
world
when
a
object
appeared
over
huntington
west
virginia
in
july
of
that
year
there
was
no
great
alarm
it
was
believed
to
be
an
american
blimp
though
the
darkness
it
was
eleven
at
night
prevented
observers
from
being
sure
but
a
later
proved
it
was
not
an
american
ship
nor
was
it
from
any
country
possessing
such
craft
for
some
time
after
this
there
were
few
authentic
reports
then
in
nicholas
roerich
head
of
the
expedition
into
tibet
had
a
remarkable
experience
that
bears
on
the
saucer
riddle
on
pages
and
of
his
book
altai
himalaya
roerich
describes
the
incident
the
expedition
party
was
in
the
wilds
of
tibet
one
morning
when
a
porter
noticed
the
peculiar
actions
of
a
buzzard
overhead
he
called
roerich
attention
to
it
then
they
all
saw
something
high
in
the
sky
moving
at
great
speed
from
north
to
south
watching
it
through
binoculars
roerich
saw
it
was
obviously
of
huge
size
and
reflecting
the
sun
rays
like
brightly
polished
metal
while
he
trailed
it
with
his
glasses
the
object
suddenly
changed
direction
from
south
to
southwest
it
was
gone
in
a
few
moments
this
was
the
last
sighting
listed
before
world
war
ii
when
i
had
finished
i
stared
out
the
plane
window
curiously
disturbed
like
most
people
i
had
grown
up
believing
the
earth
was
the
center
of
everything
life
intelligence
and
religion
now
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
belief
was
shaken
it
was
a
curious
thing
i
could
accept
the
idea
that
we
would
eventually
explore
space
land
on
the
moon
and
go
on
to
distant
planets
i
had
read
of
the
plans
and
i
knew
our
engineers
and
scientists
would
somehow
find
a
way
it
did
not
disturb
my
belief
in
our
superiority
but
faced
with
this
evidence
of
a
superior
race
in
the
universe
my
mind
rebelled
for
years
i
had
been
accustomed
to
thinking
in
terms
of
any
possible
spacemen
buck
rogers
stuff
with
space
ships
and
martians
but
now
if
these
sightings
were
true
the
shoe
was
on
the
other
foot
we
would
be
faced
with
a
race
of
beings
at
least
two
hundred
years
ahead
of
our
civilization
perhaps
thousands
in
their
eyes
we
might
look
like
primitives
my
conjectures
before
the
had
just
been
idle
thinking
i
had
not
really
believed
this
could
be
the
answer
but
now
the
question
came
back
sharply
how
would
we
react
to
a
sudden
appearance
of
space
ships
bringing
that
higher
race
to
the
earth
if
we
were
fully
prepared
educated
to
this
tremendous
adventure
it
might
come
off
without
trouble
unprepared
we
would
be
thrown
into
panic
the
lights
of
philadelphia
showed
up
ahead
and
a
thought
struck
me
what
would
philadelphians
of
have
thought
to
see
this
flying
across
their
city
at
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
what
would
the
sentries
at
valley
forge
have
done
a
year
later
if
this
lighted
airliner
had
streaked
over
their
heads
madness
stampede
those
were
the
plain
answers
but
there
was
a
difference
now
we
had
had
modern
miracles
radio
television
supersonic
planes
and
the
promise
of
still
more
miracles
we
could
be
educated
or
at
least
partly
prepared
to
accept
space
visitors
in
fifty
years
we
had
learned
to
fly
in
fifty
years
more
we
would
be
exploring
space
why
should
we
believe
such
creative
intelligence
was
limited
to
the
earth
it
would
be
incredible
if
the
earth
out
of
all
the
millions
of
planets
proved
the
only
inhabited
spot
in
the
whole
universe
but
instinctively
i
still
fought
against
believing
that
the
flying
saucers
were
space
ships
eventually
we
would
make
contact
with
races
on
other
planets
they
undoubtedly
would
someday
visit
the
earth
but
if
it
could
be
put
off
a
problem
for
later
generations
to
handle
if
the
disks
proved
american
guided
missiles
it
would
be
an
easier
answer
looking
through
the
project
saucer
report
dubarry
had
loaned
me
i
read
the
items
hoping
to
find
some
hint
that
this
was
a
smoke
screen
on
page
in
a
discussion
on
mars
i
found
this
comment
reports
of
strange
objects
seen
in
the
skies
have
been
handed
down
through
the
generations
however
scientists
believe
that
if
martians
were
now
visiting
the
earth
without
establishing
contact
it
could
be
assumed
that
they
have
just
recently
succeeded
in
space
travel
and
that
their
civilization
would
be
practically
abreast
of
ours
this
because
they
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
any
technically
established
race
would
come
here
flaunt
its
ability
in
mysterious
ways
over
the
years
but
each
time
simply
go
way
without
ever
establishing
contact
there
could
be
several
answers
to
that
the
martians
might
not
be
able
to
live
in
our
atmosphere
except
in
their
sealed
space
ships
they
or
some
other
planet
race
could
have
observed
us
periodically
to
check
on
our
slow
progress
until
we
began
to
approach
their
level
of
civilization
or
in
some
way
caused
them
concern
they
would
probably
see
no
reason
for
trying
to
make
contact
but
somehow
i
found
a
vague
comfort
in
the
argument
full
of
holes
though
it
was
searching
further
i
found
other
comments
on
one
page
the
air
force
admitted
it
was
almost
a
certainty
that
space
travelers
would
be
operating
from
planets
outside
the
solar
system
but
on
the
following
page
i
discovered
this
sentence
thus
although
visits
from
outer
space
are
believed
to
be
possible
they
are
thought
to
be
highly
improbable
what
was
the
answer
was
this
just
a
wandering
discussion
of
possibilities
badly
put
together
or
was
it
a
hint
of
the
truth
it
could
be
the
first
step
in
preparing
america
for
a
revelation
it
could
also
be
a
carefully
trick
this
whole
report
might
be
designed
to
conceal
a
secret
weapon
if
the
air
force
or
the
navy
did
have
a
secret
missile
what
better
way
to
distract
attention
the
old
sighting
reports
could
have
been
seized
on
as
a
buildup
for
space
travel
hints
then
suddenly
it
hit
me
even
if
it
were
a
smoke
screen
what
of
those
old
reports
they
still
remained
to
be
answered
there
was
only
one
possible
explanation
unless
you
discarded
the
sightings
as
lies
that
meant
discrediting
many
reliable
witnesses
naval
officers
merchant
shipmasters
explorers
astronomers
ministers
and
responsible
public
officials
besides
all
these
there
had
been
thousands
of
other
witnesses
where
large
groups
had
seen
the
objects
the
answer
seemed
inevitable
but
i
held
it
off
i
did
want
to
believe
it
with
all
the
changes
it
might
bring
the
unpredictable
effect
upon
our
civilization
if
i
kept
on
checking
i
might
find
evidence
that
would
bring
a
different
explanation
for
the
present
saucers
dubarry
had
put
another
group
of
reports
in
the
envelope
this
series
covered
the
world
war
ii
phase
and
on
up
to
the
outbreak
of
the
saucer
scare
in
the
united
states
some
of
it
about
the
foo
fighters
i
already
knew
this
was
tied
in
with
the
mystery
rockets
reported
over
sweden
the
first
swedish
sightings
had
occurred
during
the
early
part
of
the
war
most
of
the
ghost
rockets
were
seen
at
night
moving
at
tremendous
speed
since
they
came
from
the
direction
of
germany
most
swedes
believed
that
guided
rockets
were
the
answer
during
the
summer
of
after
the
russians
had
taken
over
peenemunde
the
nazi
missile
test
base
ghost
rockets
again
were
reported
flying
over
sweden
some
were
said
to
double
back
and
fly
into
soviet
areas
practically
all
were
seen
at
night
and
therefore
none
had
been
described
as
a
flying
disk
instead
they
were
said
to
be
colored
lights
red
green
blue
and
orange
often
blurred
from
their
high
speed
but
there
was
a
puzzling
complication
mystery
lights
and
sometimes
flying
disks
were
simultaneously
reported
over
greece
portugal
turkey
spain
and
even
french
morocco
either
there
were
two
answers
or
some
nation
had
developed
missiles
with
an
incredibly
long
range
by
january
sightings
in
europe
had
diminished
to
less
than
one
a
month
oddly
enough
the
first
disk
report
admitted
by
project
saucer
was
in
this
same
month
the
first
case
detailed
by
project
saucer
occurred
at
richmond
virginia
it
was
about
the
middle
of
april
a
richmond
weather
observer
had
released
a
balloon
and
was
tracking
it
with
a
theodolite
when
a
strange
object
crossed
his
field
of
vision
he
swung
the
theodolite
and
managed
to
track
the
thing
despite
its
high
speed
the
actual
speed
and
altitude
the
latter
determined
by
a
comparison
of
the
balloon
height
at
various
times
have
never
been
released
nor
has
the
air
force
released
this
observer
report
on
the
object
size
which
project
saucer
admitted
was
more
accurate
than
most
witnesses
estimates
about
the
seventeenth
of
may
a
huge
saucer
ten
times
longer
than
its
diameter
was
sighted
by
byron
savage
an
oklahoma
city
pilot
two
days
later
another
saucer
was
reported
at
manitou
springs
colorado
in
the
short
time
it
was
observed
it
was
seen
to
change
direction
twice
maneuvering
at
an
unbelievable
speed
then
on
june
came
kenneth
arnold
famous
report
which
set
off
the
saucer
scare
the
rest
of
the
story
i
now
knew
almost
by
heart
when
the
landed
at
washington
i
had
made
one
decision
since
it
was
impossible
to
check
up
on
most
of
the
old
sightings
i
would
concentrate
on
certain
recent
reports
cases
in
which
the
objects
had
been
described
as
space
ships
as
i
waited
for
a
taxi
i
looked
up
at
the
sky
it
was
a
clear
summer
night
without
a
single
cloud
beyond
the
low
hill
to
the
west
i
could
see
the
stars
i
can
still
remember
thinking
if
it
true
then
the
stars
will
never
again
seem
the
same
chapter
viii
next
morning
in
the
broad
light
of
day
the
idea
of
space
visitors
somehow
had
lost
its
menace
if
the
disks
were
space
ships
at
least
they
had
shown
no
sign
of
hostility
so
far
as
i
knew
of
course
there
was
mantell
but
if
he
had
been
downed
by
some
weapon
on
the
disk
it
could
have
been
in
most
cases
the
saucers
retreated
at
the
first
sign
of
pursuit
my
mind
was
still
reluctant
to
accept
the
answer
in
spite
of
the
old
reports
but
i
kept
thinking
of
the
famous
aircraft
designer
who
thought
the
disks
were
space
craft
the
airline
pilots
purdy
had
mentioned
blake
copilot
chuck
now
that
i
recalled
it
blake
had
been
more
embarrassed
than
seemed
called
for
when
he
told
about
chuck
perhaps
he
had
been
the
one
who
believed
the
saucers
were
space
ships
instead
of
his
absent
copilot
after
breakfast
i
went
over
the
list
of
sightings
since
june
there
were
several
saucers
that
actually
had
been
described
as
ships
the
most
famous
of
all
was
the
eastern
airlines
case
it
was
july
when
an
eastern
airlines
took
off
from
houston
texas
on
a
flight
to
atlanta
and
boston
the
airliner
captain
was
clarence
chiles
during
the
war
he
had
been
in
the
air
transport
command
with
the
rank
of
lieutenant
colonel
he
had
flying
hours
his
first
officer
was
john
whitted
a
wartime
pilot
on
both
men
were
known
in
eastern
as
careful
conservative
pilots
it
was
a
bright
moonlit
night
with
scattered
clouds
overhead
the
was
twenty
miles
west
of
montgomery
at
when
a
brilliant
craft
came
hurtling
along
the
airway
chiles
saw
it
first
and
took
it
to
be
a
jet
plane
but
the
next
instant
both
pilots
saw
that
this
was
no
jet
fighter
it
was
heading
southwest
chiles
said
later
exactly
opposite
to
our
course
whatever
it
was
it
flashed
down
toward
us
at
terrific
speed
we
veered
to
the
left
it
veered
sharply
too
and
passed
us
about
seven
hundred
feet
to
the
right
i
saw
then
that
it
had
no
wings
the
mystery
ship
passed
on
whitted
side
and
he
had
a
fairly
close
look
the
thing
was
about
one
hundred
feet
long
and
wingless
he
described
it
it
was
about
twice
the
diameter
of
a
with
no
protruding
fins
captain
chiles
said
the
cabin
appeared
like
a
pilot
compartment
except
for
its
eerie
brilliance
both
he
and
whitted
agreed
it
was
as
bright
as
a
magnesium
flare
they
saw
no
occupants
but
at
their
speed
this
was
not
surprising
an
intense
glow
came
from
the
side
of
the
ship
chiles
reported
it
was
later
suggested
by
engineers
that
the
strange
glare
could
have
come
from
a
power
plant
of
unusual
type
it
ran
the
entire
length
of
the
fuselage
like
a
blue
fluorescent
light
the
exhaust
was
a
flame
with
a
lighter
color
predominant
around
the
outer
edges
both
pilots
said
the
flame
extended
thirty
to
fifty
feet
behind
the
ship
as
it
passed
chiles
noted
a
snout
like
a
radar
pole
both
he
and
whitted
glimpsed
two
rows
of
windows
just
as
it
went
by
said
chiles
the
pilot
pulled
up
as
if
he
had
seen
the
and
wanted
to
avoid
its
there
was
a
tremendous
burst
of
flame
from
the
rear
it
zoomed
into
the
clouds
its
jet
wash
rocking
our
chiles
estimate
of
the
mystery
ship
speed
was
between
five
hundred
and
seven
hundred
miles
an
hour
as
the
object
vanished
chiles
went
back
into
the
cabin
to
check
with
the
passengers
most
had
been
asleep
or
were
drowsing
but
one
man
confirmed
that
they
were
in
their
right
senses
this
passenger
clarence
mckelvie
of
columbus
ohio
told
them
and
a
project
saucer
team
later
that
he
had
seen
a
brilliant
streak
of
light
flash
past
his
window
it
had
gone
too
swiftly
for
him
to
catch
any
details
the
interviewed
mckelvie
soon
after
he
landed
and
ran
the
following
story
kennett
square
july
ap
clarence
mckelvie
assistant
managing
editor
of
the
american
education
press
said
he
was
the
only
passenger
on
the
eal
plane
who
was
not
asleep
when
the
phantom
craft
was
sighted
saw
no
shape
or
form
mckelvie
said
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
plane
and
suddenly
i
saw
this
strange
eerie
streak
out
of
my
window
it
was
very
intense
not
like
lightning
or
anything
i
had
ever
seen
the
columbus
man
said
he
was
too
startled
and
the
object
moved
too
quickly
for
him
to
adjust
his
eyes
to
it
in
washington
air
force
officials
insisted
they
could
shed
no
light
on
the
mystery
out
in
santa
monica
general
george
kenney
then
chief
of
the
strategic
air
command
declared
the
air
force
had
nothing
remotely
like
the
ship
described
i
wish
we
did
general
kenney
told
reporters
i
sure
like
to
see
that
the
publicized
story
of
this
space
ship
set
off
another
scare
also
the
usual
cracks
about
screwball
pilots
but
chiles
and
whitted
were
not
screwballs
they
were
highly
respected
pilots
the
confirmation
added
weight
but
even
if
all
three
had
been
considered
deluded
the
air
force
investigators
could
not
get
around
the
reports
from
robbins
air
force
base
just
about
one
hour
before
the
incident
a
strange
flaming
object
came
racing
southward
through
the
night
skies
over
robbins
field
at
macon
georgia
observers
at
the
air
base
were
astounded
to
see
what
appeared
to
be
a
huge
wingless
craft
streak
overhead
trailing
a
varicolored
exhaust
the
witnesses
description
tallied
with
those
of
chiles
and
whitted
the
mystery
ship
vanished
swiftly
all
observers
agreed
that
it
disappeared
from
the
line
of
sight
just
like
a
normal
aircraft
while
i
was
working
on
this
case
a
contact
in
washington
gave
me
an
interesting
tip
within
hours
after
that
eastern
sighting
air
force
engineers
rushed
out
blueprint
plans
and
elevations
of
the
ship
based
on
what
the
two
pilots
told
them
whether
or
not
this
was
true
i
found
that
the
air
force
engineers
did
compute
the
probable
speed
and
lift
of
the
mystery
craft
the
ship
was
found
to
be
within
the
bounds
of
aerodynamic
laws
for
operations
in
our
atmosphere
here
is
the
air
force
statement
application
of
the
prandtl
theory
of
lift
indicated
that
a
fuselage
of
the
dimensions
reported
by
chiles
and
whitted
could
support
a
load
comparable
to
the
weight
of
an
aircraft
of
this
size
at
flying
speeds
in
the
range
this
supports
chiles
estimate
of
four
days
after
the
story
was
published
a
navy
spokesman
was
quoted
as
hinting
it
might
have
been
a
rocket
gone
astray
from
the
proving
grounds
in
new
mexico
the
brief
report
appeared
on
the
editorial
page
of
the
washington
star
on
july
it
ran
as
follows
the
navy
says
that
naval
technicians
have
been
testing
a
rocket
in
new
mexico
if
one
went
astray
it
could
travel
across
our
continent
in
a
short
time
at
first
glance
i
thought
this
might
be
the
real
answer
to
the
case
but
after
a
few
minutes
i
saw
it
was
almost
impossible
first
rockets
at
white
sands
are
launched
and
controlled
with
utmost
care
there
have
been
no
reported
cases
of
such
a
runaway
second
if
such
a
rocket
had
gone
astray
it
would
certainly
have
caused
wild
confusion
at
white
sands
until
they
found
where
it
landed
hundreds
of
people
would
have
known
about
it
the
story
would
be
certain
to
leak
out
third
such
a
rocket
would
have
had
to
travel
from
white
sands
to
macon
georgia
then
circle
around
south
of
this
city
for
over
forty
minutes
if
it
had
kept
on
at
the
speed
observed
at
robbins
field
it
would
have
passed
montgomery
long
before
the
reached
the
area
in
addition
the
rocket
would
have
had
to
veer
sharply
away
from
the
airliner
as
both
pilots
testified
and
then
zoom
into
the
clouds
no
test
rocket
has
automatic
controls
such
as
this
would
require
and
if
it
had
gone
astray
from
white
sands
the
station
remote
control
would
no
longer
be
guiding
it
the
eastern
airlines
space
ship
then
was
not
just
a
fugitive
rocket
but
it
could
be
a
new
type
of
aircraft
something
revolutionary
developed
in
absolute
secrecy
other
airline
pilots
had
reported
flying
disks
racing
along
the
airways
though
none
that
i
knew
of
had
described
objects
chiles
and
whitted
insisted
the
mystery
ship
was
not
a
disk
and
the
report
from
robbins
field
agreed
on
this
point
devices
or
not
it
seemed
fairly
certain
there
was
more
than
one
type
of
saucer
the
more
i
studied
the
evidence
the
harder
it
was
to
believe
that
this
was
an
ship
such
a
wingless
rocket
ship
would
require
tremendous
jet
power
to
keep
it
in
the
air
even
our
latest
jet
bombers
could
not
begin
to
approach
its
performance
going
back
over
the
project
saucer
preliminary
report
i
found
strong
evidence
that
the
air
force
was
worried
in
their
investigation
project
teams
had
screened
military
and
civilian
flight
schedules
after
nine
months
they
reported
that
the
mysterious
object
was
no
conventional
aircraft
on
april
the
air
force
admitted
that
project
saucer
had
failed
to
find
the
answer
the
space
ship
was
officially
listed
as
unidentified
but
wright
field
is
still
working
on
it
an
air
force
officer
told
me
both
chiles
and
whitted
are
responsible
pilots
and
mckelvie
has
a
reputation
for
making
careful
statements
even
without
the
robbins
field
confirmation
no
one
could
doubt
that
they
saw
something
the
space
ship
was
not
the
first
of
this
type
to
be
reported
another
wingless
aircraft
was
sighted
in
august
by
two
pilots
for
an
alabama
flying
service
it
was
at
bethel
alabama
just
after
sunset
when
a
huge
black
wingless
craft
swept
across
their
course
silhouetted
against
the
evening
sky
it
loomed
larger
than
a
the
pilots
saw
no
wings
motors
or
jet
exhausts
swinging
in
behind
the
mystery
ship
they
attempted
to
follow
but
at
their
speed
of
they
were
quickly
outdistanced
careful
checking
showed
there
were
no
other
planes
nearby
that
could
have
been
mistaken
for
this
strange
craft
on
new
year
day
a
similar
object
was
sighted
at
jackson
mississippi
it
was
first
seen
by
a
former
air
force
pilot
and
his
passenger
and
later
by
witnesses
on
the
ground
before
the
pilot
could
begin
to
close
in
the
odd
wingless
ship
pulled
away
speeding
up
from
to
it
swiftly
disappeared
besides
these
two
cases
already
on
record
i
had
the
tips
purdy
had
given
me
one
wingless
ship
was
supposed
to
have
been
seen
three
or
four
days
before
the
sighting
like
the
thing
they
reported
the
unidentified
craft
was
a
space
ship
but
moving
at
even
higher
speed
at
first
i
ran
into
a
stone
wall
trying
to
check
this
story
then
i
found
a
lead
conforming
that
this
was
a
foreign
report
it
finally
proved
to
be
from
the
hague
the
tip
had
been
right
this
wingless
ship
had
been
sighted
on
july
four
days
before
the
eastern
case
witnesses
had
reported
it
at
a
high
altitude
moving
at
fantastic
speed
while
working
on
this
report
i
verified
another
tip
we
had
heard
a
rumor
of
a
sighting
at
clark
field
in
the
philippine
islands
although
i
did
learn
the
date
i
found
that
there
was
such
a
record
in
the
final
project
saucer
report
the
attempt
to
explain
away
this
sighting
was
painfully
evident
analyzing
this
case
number
the
air
force
said
if
the
facts
are
correct
there
is
no
astronomical
explanation
a
few
points
favor
the
daytime
meteor
hypothesis
color
speed
faster
than
a
jet
the
roar
similarity
to
and
the
time
of
day
but
the
tactics
if
really
performed
oppose
it
strenuously
the
maneuvers
in
and
out
of
cloud
banks
turns
of
degrees
or
more
possibly
these
were
illusions
caused
by
seeing
the
object
intermittently
through
clouds
the
impression
of
a
fuselage
with
windows
could
even
more
easily
have
been
a
sign
of
imagination
with
this
conjecture
project
saucer
listed
the
sighting
as
officially
answered
the
hague
case
was
unexplained
in
following
up
the
jackson
and
bethel
reports
i
talked
with
two
officials
in
the
civil
aeronautics
administration
one
of
these
was
charley
planck
who
handled
public
relations
i
found
that
the
pilots
concerned
had
good
records
men
who
knew
them
discounted
the
hoax
theory
charley
there
a
rumor
that
airline
pilots
have
been
ordered
not
to
talk
i
told
planck
you
know
anything
about
it
you
mean
ordered
by
the
air
force
or
the
companies
he
said
the
air
force
and
the
if
the
in
on
it
it
a
deal
said
charley
i
think
it
more
likely
the
companies
with
or
without
a
nudge
from
the
air
force
while
we
were
talking
an
official
from
another
agency
came
in
because
the
lead
he
gave
me
was
off
the
record
i
call
him
steve
barrett
i
knew
steve
fairly
well
we
were
both
pilots
with
service
training
our
paths
had
crossed
during
the
war
and
i
saw
him
now
and
then
at
airports
around
washington
when
the
saucer
scare
first
broke
steve
had
been
disgusted
damn
fools
trying
to
get
publicity
he
snorted
the
way
americans
fall
for
a
gag
even
the
air
force
has
got
the
jitters
so
i
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
he
now
thought
the
disks
were
real
what
sold
you
i
asked
the
radar
reports
said
steve
i
know
of
half
a
dozen
cases
where
they
tracked
the
things
one
was
in
japan
the
thing
was
climbing
so
fast
no
one
believed
the
radarmen
at
first
then
they
got
some
more
reports
one
was
up
in
canada
there
was
a
case
in
new
mexico
and
i
think
a
navy
destroyer
tracked
a
saucer
up
in
the
north
atlantic
what
did
they
find
out
said
charley
planck
steve
shrugged
i
do
know
all
the
answers
whatever
they
are
the
things
can
go
like
hell
i
had
a
hunch
he
was
holding
back
i
waited
until
he
had
finished
with
charley
and
then
went
down
the
hall
with
him
you
think
the
saucers
are
guided
missiles
i
said
if
i
thought
so
i
would
be
talking
he
said
flatly
that
not
a
dig
at
you
but
i
was
cleared
last
year
for
some
secret
electronics
work
and
it
might
be
used
in
some
way
with
guided
missiles
i
did
know
that
steve
it
he
said
i
do
mind
talking
because
ca
believe
the
saucers
are
guided
missiles
maybe
few
of
the
things
sighted
out
in
the
southwest
have
beer
our
test
rockets
but
that
does
explain
the
radar
reports
in
canada
and
japan
i
already
heard
about
a
radar
case
in
labrador
i
told
steve
he
looked
at
me
quickly
where
you
pick
that
up
true
passed
it
on
to
me
i
said
they
had
some
trouble
tracking
the
things
they
maneuver
so
fast
said
steve
it
sounds
crazy
but
i
been
told
they
hit
more
than
ten
thousand
miles
an
hour
you
believe
well
it
not
impossible
those
saucers
were
tracked
about
fifty
miles
up
where
there
not
much
resistance
the
elevator
door
opened
steve
waited
until
we
were
outside
of
the
commerce
building
there
one
other
thing
that
gets
me
he
said
unless
the
radar
boys
are
way
off
some
of
those
saucers
are
enormous
i
just
ca
see
a
guided
missile
five
hundred
feet
in
diameter
he
stopped
for
a
moment
i
suppose
this
will
sound
screwy
to
you
you
think
they
interplanetary
i
said
steve
was
quickly
on
the
defensive
i
have
bought
it
yet
but
not
as
crazy
as
it
sounds
without
mentioning
names
i
told
him
about
the
aircraft
designer
and
the
airline
pilots
they
in
good
company
said
steve
you
know
the
air
institute
sure
the
air
force
school
down
at
montgomery
six
months
ago
i
was
talking
with
an
officer
who
been
instructing
there
steve
looked
at
me
deadly
serious
he
told
me
they
are
now
teaching
that
the
saucers
are
probably
space
ships
chapter
ix
three
days
after
my
meeting
with
steve
barrett
i
was
on
a
mainliner
starting
a
new
phase
of
the
saucer
investigation
by
the
time
i
returned
i
hoped
to
know
the
truth
about
project
saucer
as
the
ship
droned
westward
fourteen
thousand
feet
above
the
alleghenies
i
thought
of
what
steve
had
told
me
i
believed
that
he
had
told
me
about
the
radar
tracking
and
i
was
fairly
sure
he
believed
the
air
institute
story
but
i
was
so
certain
the
story
itself
was
true
it
would
hardly
be
a
gag
steve
was
easily
taken
in
it
was
more
likely
that
one
institute
officer
or
perhaps
several
believed
the
saucers
were
space
craft
and
aired
their
personal
opinions
the
institute
was
likely
to
give
an
official
answer
to
something
that
project
saucer
still
declared
unsolved
if
it
were
possible
to
get
an
inside
look
at
project
saucer
operations
i
could
soon
tell
whether
it
was
an
actual
investigation
or
a
deliberate
for
something
else
whichever
it
was
the
wall
of
official
secrecy
still
hid
it
as
a
formality
i
had
called
the
pentagon
again
and
asked
to
talk
with
some
of
the
project
officers
as
i
expected
i
was
turned
down
the
only
alternative
was
to
dig
out
the
story
by
talking
with
pilots
and
others
who
had
been
quizzed
by
project
teams
i
had
several
leads
and
true
had
arranged
some
interviews
for
me
my
first
stop
was
chicago
where
i
met
an
airline
official
and
two
commercial
pilots
i
saw
the
pilots
first
since
they
both
talked
in
confidence
i
will
not
use
their
right
names
one
a
midwesterner
i
already
knew
i
call
pete
farrell
the
other
a
wartime
instructor
art
green
pete
was
about
stocky
with
a
pleasant
intelligent
face
art
green
was
a
little
older
a
lean
sunburned
restless
man
with
an
emphatic
voice
pete
had
served
with
the
air
force
during
the
war
he
was
now
part
owner
of
a
flying
school
also
a
pilot
in
the
air
national
guard
green
was
working
for
an
air
charter
service
we
met
at
the
palmer
house
art
green
did
need
much
prompting
to
talk
about
project
saucer
after
reporting
a
disk
seen
during
a
west
coast
right
he
had
been
thoroughly
grilled
by
a
project
saucer
team
they
practically
took
me
apart
he
said
irritably
they
got
a
lot
of
trick
questions
some
of
are
figured
out
to
trip
up
anybody
faking
a
story
the
way
they
worked
on
me
you
think
i
committed
a
murder
then
they
tried
to
sell
me
on
the
idea
i
seen
a
balloon
or
maybe
a
plane
with
the
sun
shining
on
it
when
it
banked
i
told
them
to
go
to
the
devil
i
knew
what
i
saw
after
seventeen
years
i
got
enough
sense
to
tell
a
ship
or
a
balloon
when
i
see
it
did
they
believe
you
i
asked
him
if
they
did
they
did
let
on
two
of
acted
as
if
they
thought
i
was
nuts
the
other
think
he
was
air
force
intelligence
acted
decent
he
said
not
to
get
steamed
up
about
the
boys
it
was
their
job
to
screen
out
the
crackpots
and
on
top
of
that
i
found
out
later
the
had
checked
up
on
me
to
find
out
if
i
was
a
liar
or
a
screwball
they
went
around
to
my
boss
people
in
my
neighborhood
even
the
pilots
in
my
outfit
my
outfit
still
razzing
me
i
would
report
another
saucer
if
one
flew
through
my
cockpit
pete
farrell
had
encountered
any
project
saucer
teams
personally
but
he
had
some
interesting
angles
some
of
the
information
had
come
from
commercial
and
private
pilots
in
the
midwest
part
of
it
through
national
guard
contacts
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
pete
said
guard
pilots
got
the
same
order
as
the
air
force
if
we
saw
anything
peculiar
flying
around
we
were
to
do
our
damnedest
to
identify
it
what
about
trying
to
bring
one
down
i
heard
that
was
in
one
order
pete
hesitated
for
a
second
look
i
told
you
that
much
because
been
in
the
papers
but
i
still
in
the
guard
i
ca
tell
you
the
order
itself
it
was
confidential
well
i
not
in
the
guard
said
art
green
he
lit
a
cigarette
blew
out
the
match
why
do
you
look
into
the
gorman
case
get
thc
dope
on
that
angle
i
heard
of
the
gorman
case
but
the
thing
was
new
to
me
gorman
i
recalled
was
a
fighter
pilot
in
the
north
dakota
air
national
guard
he
had
a
mystifying
encounter
with
a
strange
light
over
fargo
airport
in
the
fall
of
that
case
is
on
my
list
i
told
green
but
i
do
remember
anything
about
a
it
was
in
the
papers
but
all
the
pilots
up
that
way
know
about
it
in
his
report
gorman
said
something
about
trying
to
ram
the
thing
the
idea
got
around
that
air
force
orders
had
said
to
try
this
anyway
it
got
into
the
papers
and
gorman
almost
got
if
his
family
had
had
some
influence
in
the
state
the
air
force
probably
would
have
pushed
it
are
you
sure
about
this
i
said
you
know
how
those
things
build
up
ask
gorman
he
said
or
ask
some
of
the
pilots
at
fargo
before
i
left
them
green
my
report
on
his
sighting
which
hilton
had
forwarded
as
in
the
majority
of
cases
he
had
seen
just
one
disk
it
had
hovered
at
a
very
high
altitude
gleaming
in
the
sun
then
had
suddenly
accelerated
and
raced
off
to
the
north
i
could
tell
its
size
or
speed
said
green
but
if
it
was
as
high
as
i
think
it
must
have
been
pretty
big
pete
told
me
later
that
green
believed
the
disk
had
been
at
least
twenty
miles
high
because
it
was
well
above
clouds
at
thirty
thousand
feet
it
kind
of
hard
to
believe
said
pete
the
thing
would
have
to
be
a
lot
bigger
than
a
and
the
speed
over
two
thousand
miles
an
hour
you
know
what
they
said
about
the
mantell
saucer
i
reminded
him
some
of
the
godman
field
people
said
it
was
at
least
three
hundred
feet
in
diameter
i
heard
it
was
twice
that
said
pete
you
know
any
kentucky
national
guard
pilots
i
asked
one
or
two
said
pete
but
they
could
tell
me
anything
it
was
hushed
up
too
fast
that
evening
i
talked
with
the
airline
official
whom
i
knew
well
enough
to
call
by
his
first
name
i
put
it
to
him
bluntly
dick
if
you
under
orders
not
to
talk
just
tell
me
fm
trying
to
find
out
whether
project
has
muzzled
airline
pilots
you
mean
the
ones
who
sighted
things
perhaps
in
a
few
cases
but
most
of
the
pilots
know
what
happened
to
captain
emil
smith
on
united
and
those
eastern
pilots
they
keep
still
so
they
wo
be
laughed
at
also
the
airlines
do
like
their
pilots
to
talk
for
publication
i
heard
of
several
cases
i
said
where
air
force
intelligence
is
supposed
to
have
warned
pilots
to
keep
mum
two
of
the
reports
come
pretty
straight
he
made
a
gesture
that
could
be
i
not
denying
that
airline
pilots
and
that
includes
ours
see
these
things
all
the
time
been
sighted
on
the
route
and
between
anchorage
and
japan
i
know
of
several
saucers
that
pilots
have
seen
between
honolulu
and
the
mainland
check
with
you
find
their
pilots
have
seen
them
too
what
happens
to
those
reports
they
go
to
operations
said
dick
of
course
if
something
really
important
happens
the
pilot
may
radio
the
tower
before
he
lands
then
the
gets
word
to
the
air
force
and
they
rush
some
intelligence
officers
to
quiz
the
pilots
if
it
not
too
hot
they
come
from
wright
field
regular
project
teams
otherwise
they
send
the
nearest
intelligence
officers
to
take
over
temporarily
i
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
been
in
on
one
of
thee
sessions
dick
said
he
had
but
a
couple
of
pilots
talked
to
me
later
they
said
these
air
force
men
seemed
quite
upset
about
it
they
pounced
on
everything
these
boys
said
about
the
thing
appearance
how
it
maneuvered
and
so
on
what
do
your
pilots
think
the
saucers
are
dick
gave
me
a
slightly
ironic
grin
why
ask
me
captain
blake
says
you
been
getting
it
firsthand
i
was
pulling
a
fast
one
i
protested
we
not
going
to
quote
actual
names
or
sources
unless
people
it
sure
i
know
that
said
dick
but
you
got
thc
answer
already
some
pilots
say
interplanetary
some
say
guided
missiles
a
few
a
very
few
still
think
it
all
nonsense
because
they
have
seen
any
what
do
you
think
i
do
know
the
answer
said
dick
but
i
positive
of
one
thing
either
the
air
force
is
sitting
on
a
big
secret
or
they
badly
scared
because
they
do
know
the
answer
during
the
next
week
or
so
i
covered
several
northwest
and
mountain
states
although
i
was
chiefly
trying
to
find
out
about
project
saucer
i
ran
onto
two
sightings
that
were
not
on
my
list
one
of
these
had
occurred
in
california
at
fairfield
suisan
air
force
base
a
seattle
man
who
had
been
stationed
there
gave
me
the
details
it
was
on
the
night
of
december
with
unusually
high
winds
sweeping
across
the
airfield
at
times
the
gusts
reached
almost
seventy
miles
an
hour
suddenly
a
weird
ball
of
light
flashed
into
view
at
a
height
of
a
thousand
feet
as
the
men
on
the
base
watched
it
astonished
the
mysterious
light
abruptly
shot
skyward
in
an
incredibly
short
time
it
reached
an
altitude
of
twenty
thousand
feet
and
vanished
was
there
any
shape
outlined
behind
the
light
i
asked
the
seattle
man
nobody
saw
any
he
replied
it
looked
just
like
i
said
a
ball
of
light
going
like
a
streak
did
it
leave
any
smoke
behind
it
you
mean
like
an
engine
or
a
jet
he
shook
his
head
not
a
thing
and
it
did
make
a
sound
even
when
it
shot
up
like
that
did
you
hear
any
guesses
about
it
or
reports
later
on
some
major
who
did
see
it
said
it
must
have
been
a
balloon
anybody
with
brains
could
see
that
was
screwy
no
balloon
ever
went
up
that
fast
and
besides
the
thing
was
going
against
the
wind
the
second
incident
occurred
at
salmon
dam
idaho
on
august
when
i
heard
the
date
it
sounded
familiar
i
checked
my
sightings
file
and
saw
it
was
the
same
day
as
the
strange
affair
at
twin
falls
idaho
in
the
twin
falls
case
the
disk
was
sighted
by
observers
in
a
canyon
there
was
one
interesting
difference
from
the
usual
description
this
disk
was
or
else
its
gleaming
surface
somehow
reflected
the
sky
because
of
the
angle
of
vision
although
it
was
not
close
to
the
treetops
the
observers
were
amazed
to
see
the
trees
whip
violently
when
the
disk
raced
overhead
as
though
the
air
was
boiling
from
the
object
swift
passage
at
salmon
dam
that
same
day
two
miners
heard
an
odd
roaring
sound
and
stared
into
the
sky
several
miles
away
two
brightly
gleaming
disks
were
circling
at
high
speed
it
was
like
two
round
mirrors
whirling
around
the
sky
one
of
the
men
was
later
quoted
as
saying
they
could
have
been
any
ordinary
planes
not
round
like
that
and
they
were
going
too
fast
during
this
part
of
my
trip
i
also
was
told
that
one
saucer
had
fallen
into
a
mountain
lake
this
came
to
me
secondhand
the
lone
witness
was
said
to
have
rushed
over
to
his
car
to
get
his
camera
as
the
disk
approached
when
it
plunged
toward
the
lake
he
was
so
startled
that
he
failed
to
snap
the
picture
until
the
moment
it
struck
this
story
sounded
so
flimsy
that
i
did
bother
to
list
it
months
later
a
washington
newsman
confirmed
at
least
part
of
the
lake
story
when
he
first
related
it
i
thought
he
had
fallen
for
a
gag
i
heard
that
yarn
i
said
do
tell
me
you
believe
it
i
come
from
idaho
he
told
me
and
i
happen
to
know
the
fellow
who
took
the
picture
maybe
it
was
a
disk
but
something
fell
into
that
lake
did
you
see
the
picture
yes
at
the
pentagon
at
my
surprised
look
he
added
that
was
long
before
they
clamped
down
i
was
talking
to
an
air
force
officer
about
this
lake
thing
and
he
showed
me
the
picture
what
did
it
look
like
you
could
tell
much
about
a
big
splash
and
a
blur
where
something
went
under
maybe
a
magnifying
glass
would
bring
it
out
but
i
did
get
a
chance
to
try
it
it
was
early
in
when
he
told
me
this
i
asked
at
the
pentagon
if
this
picture
was
in
the
wright
field
files
and
if
so
whether
i
could
see
it
my
inquiries
drew
blank
looks
no
one
remembered
such
a
photograph
and
even
if
it
were
in
the
project
saucer
files
i
could
see
it
this
was
more
than
two
months
after
project
saucer
had
been
officially
closed
and
its
secrets
presumably
all
revealed
the
rest
of
my
interviews
during
this
trip
helped
to
round
out
my
picture
of
project
saucer
operations
some
witnesses
seemed
afraid
to
talk
a
few
flatly
refused
i
found
no
proof
of
official
pressure
but
i
frequently
had
the
feeling
that
strong
hints
had
been
dropped
though
one
or
two
witnesses
showed
resentment
at
methods
most
of
them
seemed
more
annoyed
at
the
loss
of
time
involved
one
man
had
been
checked
first
by
the
police
then
by
the
sheriff
office
an
air
force
team
had
spent
hours
questioning
him
returning
the
next
day
and
finally
the
had
made
a
character
check
what
he
told
me
about
the
air
force
interrogation
confirmed
one
of
art
green
statements
one
intelligence
captain
tried
to
tell
me
i
seen
a
weather
balloon
i
called
up
the
airport
and
had
them
check
on
release
schedules
they
said
next
day
it
did
fit
any
schedules
around
this
area
anyway
the
wind
was
right
because
the
thing
i
saw
was
cutting
into
the
wind
at
a
angle
other
witnesses
told
me
that
investigators
had
suggested
birds
meteors
reflections
on
clouds
shooting
stars
and
starshells
as
probable
explanations
of
what
they
had
seen
i
learned
of
one
pilot
who
had
been
startled
by
seeing
a
group
of
disks
racing
past
his
plane
air
force
investigators
later
suggested
that
he
had
flown
through
a
flock
of
birds
or
perhaps
a
cluster
of
balloons
on
the
flight
back
to
washington
i
reread
all
the
information
the
air
force
had
released
on
project
saucer
suddenly
a
familiar
phrase
caught
my
eye
i
read
over
the
paragraph
again
preliminary
study
of
the
more
than
domestic
and
thirty
foreign
incidents
by
hynek
indicates
that
an
total
of
about
can
probably
be
explained
away
as
astronomical
phenomena
explained
away
i
went
through
the
report
line
by
line
on
page
i
found
this
available
preliminary
reports
now
indicate
that
a
great
number
of
sightings
can
be
explained
away
as
ordinary
occurrences
which
have
been
misrepresented
as
a
result
of
human
errors
on
page
i
ran
onto
another
use
of
the
phrase
the
obvious
explanation
for
most
of
the
objects
reported
as
already
mentioned
is
that
they
are
meteorological
or
similar
type
balloons
this
however
does
not
explain
reports
that
they
travel
at
high
speed
or
maneuver
rapidly
but
men
point
out
that
the
movement
could
be
explained
away
as
an
optical
illusion
or
actual
acceleration
of
the
balloon
caused
by
a
gas
leak
and
later
exaggerated
by
observers
there
are
scores
of
possible
explanations
for
the
scores
of
different
type
sightings
reported
explained
away
it
might
not
mean
anything
it
could
be
just
an
unfortunate
choice
of
words
but
suppose
that
the
real
mission
of
project
saucer
was
to
cover
up
something
or
that
its
purpose
was
to
investigate
something
serious
at
the
same
time
covering
it
up
step
by
step
the
project
saucer
teams
then
would
check
on
reports
and
simultaneously
try
to
divert
attention
from
the
truth
suggesting
various
answers
to
explain
the
sightings
back
at
wright
field
analysts
and
intelligence
officers
would
go
over
the
general
picture
and
try
to
work
up
plausible
explanations
which
if
necessary
could
even
be
published
explaining
away
would
be
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
project
personnel
these
words
would
probably
be
used
in
discussions
of
ways
and
means
they
would
undoubtedly
would
be
used
in
secret
official
papers
and
since
this
published
preliminary
report
had
been
made
up
from
censored
secret
files
the
use
of
those
familiar
words
might
have
been
overlooked
since
read
casually
they
would
appear
harmless
if
the
report
had
been
thrown
together
hastily
the
use
of
these
telltale
words
could
be
easily
understood
and
so
could
the
report
strange
contradictions
as
an
experiment
i
fixed
the
idea
firmly
in
mind
that
project
saucer
was
a
unit
then
i
went
back
once
more
and
read
the
items
quoted
above
the
effect
was
almost
startling
it
was
as
though
i
were
reading
confidential
suggestions
for
diverting
attention
and
explaining
away
the
sightings
suggestions
made
by
project
members
and
probably
circulated
for
comment
now
wait
a
minute
i
said
to
myself
you
may
be
dreaming
up
this
whole
thing
trying
to
get
back
to
a
neutral
viewpoint
i
skimmed
through
the
other
details
of
project
operations
as
described
in
the
report
the
order
creating
project
saucer
was
signed
on
december
the
actual
code
name
was
not
saucer
but
since
for
some
reason
the
air
force
still
has
not
published
the
name
i
have
followed
their
usage
of
saucer
in
its
place
on
january
two
weeks
after
captain
mantell
death
the
project
officially
began
operations
preliminary
investigation
at
godman
field
had
been
done
by
local
intelligence
officers
project
saucer
was
set
up
under
the
air
materiel
command
at
wright
field
contracts
were
made
with
an
astrophysicist
professor
joseph
hynek
also
a
prominent
scientist
still
unidentified
and
a
group
of
evaluation
experts
rand
corporation
arrangements
were
made
for
services
by
the
air
weather
service
andrews

the

the
electronics

the

the

the
the

and
various
other
government
and
private
agencies
in
addition
the
services
of
rocket
experts
authorities
planners
and
others
in
the
defense
services
or
assigned
to
them
were
made
available
as
desired
under
the
heading
how
incidents
are
investigated
the
project
saucer
report
says
but
the
hoaxes
and
crank
letters
in
reality
play
a
small
part
in
project
saucer
actually
it
is
a
serious
scientific
business
of
constant
investigation
analysis
and
evaluation
which
thus
far
has
yielded
evidence
pointing
to
the
conclusion
that
much
of
the
saucer
scare
is
no
scare
at
all
but
can
be
attributed
to
astronomical
phenomena
to
conventional
aerial
objects
to
hallucinations
and
to
mass
psychology
but
the
mere
existence
of
some
yet
unidentified
flying
objects
necessitates
a
constant
vigilance
on
the
part
of
project
saucer
personnel
and
the
civilian
population
investigation
is
greatly
stepped
up
when
observers
report
incidents
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
nearest
military
installation
or
to
headquarters
direct
a
standard
questionnaire
is
filled
out
under
the
guidance
of
interrogators
in
each
case
time
location
size
and
shape
of
object
approximate
altitude
speed
maneuvers
color
length
of
time
in
sight
sound
are
carefully
noted
this
information
is
sent
in
its
entirety
together
with
any
fragments
soil
photographs
drawings
to
headquarters
here
highly
trained
evaluation
teams
take
over
the
information
is
broken
down
and
filed
on
summary
sheets
plotted
on
maps
and
graphs
and
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
material
giving
an
easily
comprehended
picture
duplicate
copies
on
each
incident
arc
sent
to
other
investigating
agencies
including
technical
labs
within
the
air
materiel
command
these
are
studied
in
relation
to
many
factors
such
as
guided
missile
research
activity
weather
and
many
others
atmospheric
sounding
balloon
launchings
commercial
and
military
aircraft
flights
flights
of
migratory
birds
and
a
myriad
of
other
considerations
which
might
furnish
explanations
generally
the
flying
objects
are
divided
into
four
groups
flying
disks
torpedo
or
bodies
with
no
wings
or
fins
visible
in
flight
spherical
or
objects
and
balls
of
light
the
first
three
groups
are
capable
of
flight
by
aerodynamic
or
aerostatic
means
and
can
be
propelled
and
controlled
by
methods
known
to
aeronautical
engineers
as
for
the
lights
their
actions
unless
they
were
suspended
from
a
higher
object
or
were
the
product
of
hallucination
remain
unexplained
eventually
reports
are
sent
back
to
project
saucer
headquarters
often
marking
incidents
closed
the
project
however
is
a
young
of
its
investigation
is
still
under
way
currently
a
psychological
analysis
is
being
made
by
laboratory
to
determine
what
percentage
of
incidents
are
probably
based
on
errors
of
the
human
mind
and
senses
available
preliminary
reports
now
indicate
that
a
great
number
can
be
explained
away
as
ordinary
occurrences
which
have
been
misrepresented
as
a
result
of
these
human
errors
near
the
end
of
the
last
page
a
paragraph
summed
tip
the
report
the
are
not
a
joke
neither
are
they
cause
for
alarm
to
the
population
many
of
the
incidents
already
have
answers
meteors
balloons
falling
stars
birds
in
flight
testing
devices
etc
some
of
them
still
end
in
question
marks
from
what
i
had
learned
on
this
trip
i
strongly
doubted
the
answer
suggested
all
but
the
testing
devices
what
did
they
mean
by
that
it
could
be
a
hint
at
guided
missiles
they
had
already
mentioned
research
activity
in
another
spot
but
if
that
was
what
lay
behind
this
elaborate
project
they
would
hardly
be
hinting
at
it
if
the
answer
was
space
travel
then
such
hints
made
sense
they
would
be
part
of
the
plan
everyone
including
the
soviet
union
knew
we
were
working
on
guided
missiles
it
would
do
no
harm
to
use
this
as
one
of
the
myriad
explanations
for
the
flying
saucers
i
was
still
trying
to
figure
it
out
when
my
plane
let
down
for
the
landing
at
washington
i
had
hoped
by
this
time
to
know
the
truth
about
project
saucer
instead
it
was
a
deeper
mystery
than
ever
true
i
had
found
out
how
they
operated
outside
of
wright
field
some
of
the
incidents
had
been
enlightening
by
now
i
was
certain
that
project
saucer
was
trying
hard
to
explain
away
the
sightings
and
hide
the
real
answer
chapter
x
when
i
reached
home
i
found
a
brief
letter
from
ken
purdy
dear
don
the
mantell
and
eastern
cases
both
look
good
i
do
see
how
they
can
brush
them
off
it
looks
more
like
the
interplanetary
answer
to
me
but
we
wo
decide
on
treatment
until
we
sure
i
had
suggested
two
or
three
angles
if
this
proved
the
real
answer
who
would
be
the
best
authority
to
check
our
disk
operation
theory
and
give
us
more
details
on
directional
control
i
like
to
have
it
checked
by
two
more
engineers
ken
next
day
i
dug
out
my
copy
of
boal
interview
with
d
the
famous
aircraft
designer
certainly
the
flying
saucers
are
possible
the
designer
had
told
boal
give
me
enough
money
and
i
build
you
one
it
might
have
to
be
a
model
because
the
fuel
would
be
a
problem
if
the
saucers
that
have
been
seen
came
from
other
worlds
which
is
at
all
buck
rogerish
they
may
be
powered
with
atomic
energy
or
by
the
energy
that
produces
cosmic
rays
which
is
many
times
more
powerful
or
by
some
other
fuel
or
natural
force
that
our
research
has
yet
discovered
but
the
circular
airfoil
is
quite
feasible
it
would
have
the
stability
of
the
conventional
airplane
but
it
would
have
enormous
maneuverability
it
could
rise
vertically
hover
descend
vertically
and
fly
at
extremely
high
speed
with
the
proper
power
do
take
my
word
for
it
check
with
other
engineers
before
looking
up
a
private
engineer
i
had
in
mind
i
went
to
the
national
advisory
committee
for
aeronautics
the
the
predecessor
of
nasa
jbh
is
america
most
authoritative
source
of
aerodynamic
knowledge
i
knew
they
had
already
tried
out
airfoils
and
i
asked
about
this
first
i
found
that
two
official
reports
technical
note
and
report
discuss
tests
on
circular
and
elliptical
clark
y
airfoils
both
reports
state
that
these
designs
were
found
practical
later
i
talked
with
one
of
the
top
engineers
in
the
without
showing
him
d
sketch
i
asked
how
a
disk
might
operate
it
could
be
built
with
jet
or
rocket
nozzles
be
said
the
nozzles
would
be
placed
around
the
rim
and
by
changing
their
direction
the
disk
could
be
made
to
rise
and
descend
vertically
it
could
hover
fly
straight
ahead
and
make
sharp
turns
its
direction
and
velocity
would
be
governed
by
the
number
of
nozzles
operating
the
power
applied
and
the
angle
at
which
they
were
tilted
they
could
be
pointed
toward
the
ground
rearward
in
a
lateral
direction
or
in
various
combinations
a
disk
flying
level
straight
ahead
could
be
turned
swiftly
to
right
or
left
by
shifting
the
angles
of
the
nozzles
or
cutting
off
power
from
part
of
the
group
this
method
of
control
would
operate
in
the
earth
atmosphere
and
also
using
rocket
power
in
free
space
where
conventional
controls
would
be
useless
the
method
he
had
described
was
not
the
one
which
d
had
outlined
what
about
a
rotating
disk
i
asked
the
man
suppose
you
had
one
with
a
stationary
center
and
a
large
circular
section
rotating
around
it
the
rotating
part
would
have
a
camber
built
into
it
or
it
would
have
slotted
vanes
he
gave
me
a
curious
look
where
you
get
that
idea
about
the
camber
i
told
him
it
had
come
to
me
from
true
it
could
be
done
he
said
the
method
has
already
been
tried
there
an
engineer
in
glendale
california
who
built
a
model
his
name
w
kay
he
gave
me
a
few
details
on
how
a
cambered
or
rotating
disk
might
operate
then
interrupted
himself
to
ask
me
what
i
thought
the
saucers
were
they
either
interplanetary
or
some
secret
development
i
said
do
you
think
the
has
no
proof
they
even
exist
he
answered
when
i
left
the
building
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
still
weighing
that
statement
if
the
air
force
or
the
navy
had
a
secret
disk
device
the
would
almost
certainly
know
about
it
the
chances
were
that
any
missile
or
new
type
of
circular
aircraft
would
first
have
been
tested
in
the
wind
tunnels
at
langley
field
if
the
saucers
were
interplanetary
the
at
least
top
officials
would
probably
have
been
in
on
any
discussion
of
the
performance
either
way
the
official
attitude
could
be
expected
to
match
the
pentagon
after
lunch
i
took
a
taxi
to
the
office
of
the
private
engineer
like
d
he
has
asked
that
he
not
be
quoted
by
name
the
name
i
am
using
paul
redell
will
serve
that
purpose
redell
is
a
aeronautical
engineer
he
has
worked
with
major
aircraft
companies
and
served
as
a
special
consultant
to
government
agencies
and
the
industries
he
is
also
a
competent
pilot
although
i
had
known
him
several
years
he
refused
at
first
to
talk
about
the
saucers
then
i
realized
he
thought
i
meant
to
quote
him
i
showed
him
some
of
the
material
i
had
roughed
out
in
which
names
were
omitted
or
changed
as
requested
all
right
redell
said
finally
what
do
you
want
to
know
anything
you
can
tell
us
but
first
your
ideas
on
these
sketches
i
showed
him
d
drawings
and
then
gave
him
the
high
points
of
the
investigation
when
i
mentioned
the
incident
at
fairfield
suisan
air
force
base
redell
sat
up
quickly
the
gorman
case
again
we
heard
about
some
other
cases
i
said
one
was
at
las
vegas
i
know
about
that
one
that
is
it
you
mean
the
green
light
wait
a
minute
redell
frowned
into
space
for
a
few
seconds
you
say
that
fairfield
suisan
sighting
was
on
december
third
then
the
las
vegas
sighting
was
only
a
few
days
later
it
was
the
first
week
of
the
month
i
positive
those
light
reports
have
got
me
stumped
i
said
a
light
just
fly
around
by
itself
and
those
disks
you
have
worked
on
the
gorman
case
asked
redell
i
told
him
i
had
thought
it
was
coming
up
on
my
schedule
leave
these
sketches
here
he
said
look
into
that
gorman
sighting
then
check
on
our
plans
for
space
exploration
i
give
you
some
sources
when
you
get
through
come
on
back
and
we
talk
it
over
the
gorman
saucer
dogfight
had
been
described
in
newspapers
the
pilot
had
reported
chasing
a
swiftly
maneuvering
white
light
which
had
finally
escaped
him
judging
from
the
project
saucer
preliminary
report
this
case
had
baffled
all
the
air
force
investigators
when
i
met
george
gorman
i
found
him
to
be
intelligent
coolheaded
and
very
firmly
convinced
of
every
detail
in
his
story
i
had
learned
something
about
his
background
he
had
had
college
training
during
the
war
he
had
been
an
air
force
instructor
training
french
student
pilots
in
fargo
his
home
he
had
a
good
reputation
not
only
for
veracity
but
as
a
businessman
only
he
was
part
owner
of
a
construction
company
and
also
the
fargo
representative
for
a
chain
even
knowing
all
this
i
found
it
hard
at
first
to
believe
some
of
the
dogfight
details
but
the
ground
observers
confirmed
them
it
was
about
nine
in
the
evening
october
gorman
now
an
air
national
guard
lieutenant
had
been
on
a
practice
flight
in
an
fighter
the
other
pilots
on
this
practice
patrol
had
already
landed
gorman
had
just
been
cleared
by
the
operator
in
the
fargo
airport
tower
when
he
saw
a
light
below
his
circling
fighter
from
his
altitude
feet
it
appeared
to
be
the
tail
light
of
a
swiftly
flying
plane
as
nearly
as
he
could
tell
it
was
feet
high
moving
at
about
gorman
called
the
tower
to
recheck
his
clearance
he
was
told
the
only
other
plane
in
the
area
was
a
piper
cub
gorman
could
see
the
cub
plainly
outlined
below
him
there
was
a
night
football
game
going
on
and
the
field
was
brightly
lighted
but
the
cub
was
nowhere
near
the
strange
light
as
the
mystery
light
raced
above
the
football
field
gorman
noticed
an
odd
phenomenon
instead
of
seeing
the
silhouette
of
a
plane
he
saw
no
shape
at
all
around
the
light
by
contrast
he
could
see
the
outline
clearly
meantime
the
airport
traffic
controller
jensen
had
also
spotted
the
queer
light
concerned
with
the
danger
of
collision
he
said
later
that
he
too
thought
it
a
plane
tail
light
he
trained
his
binoculars
on
it
like
gorman
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
a
shape
near
the
light
neither
could
another
man
who
was
with
him
in
the
tower
a
fargo
resident
named
manuel
johnson
up
in
the
gorman
dived
on
the
light
which
was
steadily
blinking
on
and
off
as
i
closed
in
he
told
project
saucer
men
later
it
suddenly
became
steady
and
pulled
up
into
a
sharp
left
turn
it
was
a
clear
white
and
completely
roundabout
six
to
eight
inches
in
diameter
i
thought
it
was
making
a
pass
at
the
tower
i
dived
after
it
and
brought
my
manifold
pressure
up
to
sixty
but
i
could
catch
the
thing
gorman
reported
his
speed
at
full
power
as
to
miles
per
hour
during
the
maneuvers
that
followed
both
the
men
watched
from
the
tower
jensen
was
using
powerful
night
glasses
but
still
no
shape
was
visible
near
the
mysterious
light
the
fantastic
dogfight
continued
for
twenty
minutes
gorman
described
it
in
detail
when
i
attempted
to
turn
with
the
light
i
blacked
out
temporarily
owing
to
excessive
speed
i
am
in
fairly
good
physical
condition
and
i
do
believe
there
are
many
if
any
pilots
who
could
withstand
the
turn
and
speed
effected
by
the
light
and
remain
conscious
during
these
sharp
maneuvers
the
light
climbed
quickly
then
made
another
left
bank
i
put
my
into
a
sharp
turn
and
tried
to
cut
it
off
said
gorman
by
then
we
were
at
about
seven
thousand
feet
suddenly
it
made
a
sharp
right
turn
and
we
headed
straight
at
each
other
just
when
we
were
about
to
collide
i
guess
i
lost
my
nerve
i
went
into
a
dive
and
the
light
passed
over
my
canopy
at
about
five
hundred
feet
then
it
made
a
left
circle
about
one
thousand
feet
above
and
i
gave
chase
again
when
collision
seemed
imminent
a
second
time
the
object
shot
straight
into
the
air
gorman
climbed
after
it
at
full
throttle
just
about
this
time
two
other
witnesses
a
private
pilot
and
his
passenger
saw
the
light
the
pilot
was
cannon
an
oculist
his
passenger
was
einar
nelson
cannon
later
told
investigators
the
light
was
moving
at
high
speed
he
thought
it
might
be
a
canadian
jet
fighter
from
over
the
border
a
careful
check
with
canadian
air
officials
ruled
out
this
answer
after
landing
at
the
airport
cannon
and
nelson
again
watched
the
light
saw
it
change
direction
and
disappear
meanwhile
gorman
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
catch
the
thing
he
was
now
determined
to
ram
it
since
there
seemed
nothing
solid
behind
it
to
cause
a
dangerous
crash
if
his
fighter
was
disabled
or
if
it
caught
fire
he
could
bail
out
but
despite
the
fast
climb
the
light
still
outdistanced
him
at
feet
gorman
plane
went
into
a
power
stall
he
made
one
last
try
climbing
up
to
feet
a
few
moments
later
the
light
turned
in
a
direction
and
quickly
disappeared
throughout
the
dogfight
gorman
noticed
no
deviation
on
his
instruments
according
to
the
project
saucer
report
gorman
did
not
confirm
or
deny
this
when
i
talked
with
him
but
he
did
agree
with
the
rest
of
the
project
statement
he
did
not
notice
any
sound
odor
or
exhaust
trail
gorman
remarks
about
ramming
the
light
reminded
me
of
what
art
green
had
said
when
i
asked
gorman
about
the
rumor
he
gave
me
a
searching
glance
where
did
you
hear
that
several
places
i
told
him
at
chicago
in
salt
lake
city
in
fact
we
been
hearing
it
all
over
well
there
nothing
to
it
gorman
declared
he
changed
the
subject
some
time
afterward
a
fargo
pilot
told
me
there
had
been
trouble
over
the
ramming
story
but
it
was
gorman
fault
somebody
else
released
that
report
to
the
the
news
story
did
actually
say
there
was
an
air
force
order
to
ram
it
but
the
idea
got
around
and
we
heard
that
washington
squawked
gorman
had
a
pretty
rough
time
of
it
for
a
while
some
of
the
newspapers
razzed
his
story
and
the
project
teams
really
worked
on
him
i
guess
they
were
trying
to
scare
him
into
saying
he
was
mistaken
and
it
was
a
balloon
when
i
asked
gorman
about
this
he
denied
he
had
rough
treatment
by
the
project
teams
sure
they
asked
about
a
thousand
questions
and
i
could
tell
they
thought
it
might
be
a
hoax
at
first
but
that
was
before
they
quizzed
the
others
who
saw
it
anybody
suggest
it
was
a
balloon
i
said
casually
at
first
they
were
sure
that
what
it
was
answered
gorman
you
see
there
was
a
weather
balloon
released
here
you
know
the
kind
it
has
a
lighted
candle
on
it
the
project
teams
said
i
chased
after
that
candle
and
just
imagined
the
light
maneuvers
confused
it
with
my
own
movement
because
of
the
dark
gorman
grinned
they
had
it
just
about
wrapped
up
until
they
talked
to
george
sanderson
he
the
weather
observer
he
was
tracking
the
balloon
with
a
theodolite
and
he
showed
them
his
records
the
time
and
altitudes
did
fit
and
the
wind
direction
was
wrong
the
balloon
was
drifting
in
the
opposite
direction
both
the
tower
men
backed
him
up
so
that
killed
the
idea
the
next
step
by
project
saucer
investigators
had
been
to
look
for
some
unidentified
aircraft
this
failed
too
obviously
it
was
only
routine
the
outline
of
a
conventional
plane
would
certainly
have
been
seen
by
gorman
and
the
men
in
the
tower
an
astronomical
check
by
professor
hynek
ruled
out
stars
fireballs
and
comets
a
vain
hope
to
begin
with
the
only
other
conventional
answer
as
the
project
report
later
stated
was
hallucination
in
view
of
all
the
testimony
hallucination
had
to
he
ruled
out
finally
the
investigators
admitted
they
had
no
solution
the
first
project
saucer
report
on
april
left
the
gorman
mystery
light
unidentified
in
the
saturday
evening
post
of
may
sidney
shallett
analyzed
the
gorman
case
in
the
second
of
his
articles
on
flying
saucers
shallet
suggested
this
solution
that
gorman
had
chased
one
of
the
navy
giant
research
balloons
each
of
these
huge
balloons
is
lighted
so
that
planes
will
not
collide
with
the
gas
bag
or
the
instrument
case
suspended
below
shallett
concluded
that
gorman
was
suffering
from
a
combination
of
vertigo
and
confusion
with
the
light
on
the
balloon
as
already
mentioned
these
huge
navy
balloons
are
filled
with
only
a
small
amount
of
helium
before
their
release
at
minneapolis
they
then
rise
swiftly
to
very
high
altitudes
unless
a
leak
develops
in
shallett
words
these
balloons
travel
high
and
fast
fargo
is
about
two
hundred
miles
from
minneapolis
normally
a
research
balloon
would
have
reached
a
very
high
altitude
by
the
time
it
had
drifted
this
far
the
only
possible
answer
to
its
sighting
would
be
a
serious
leak
if
a
leaking
balloon
had
come
down
to
one
thousand
feet
at
fargo
it
would
either
have
remained
at
that
height
or
kept
on
descending
the
mystery
light
was
observed
at
this
altitude
moving
at
high
speed
if
a
cub
outline
was
visible
against
the
lighted
football
field
the
massive
shape
of
even
a
partly
deflated
balloon
would
have
stood
out
like
an
elephant
even
before
release
the
partially
inflated
gas
bags
are
almost
a
hundred
feet
tall
the
crowd
at
the
football
game
would
certainly
have
seen
such
a
monstrous
shape
above
the
glare
of
the
floodlights
for
the
plastic
balloons
gleam
brightly
in
any
light
rays
the
two
men
watching
with
binoculars
could
not
possibly
have
missed
it
for
the
answer
to
be
correct
this
leaking
gas
bag
would
have
had
to
rise
swiftly
to
seventeen
thousand
feet
after
a
loss
of
helium
had
forced
it
down
to
one
thousand
as
a
balloon
pilot
i
know
this
is
impossible
the
project
saucer
report
said
unequivocally
the
object
could
outturn
and
outspeed
the
and
was
able
to
attain
a
much
steeper
climb
and
to
maintain
a
constant
rate
of
climb
far
in
excess
of
the
air
force
fighter
a
leaking
balloon
more
and
more
i
became
convinced
that
secretary
forrestal
had
persuaded
some
editors
that
it
was
their
patriotic
duty
to
conceal
the
answer
whatever
it
was
that
thought
had
begun
to
worry
me
because
of
my
part
in
this
investigation
perhaps
john
steele
had
been
right
and
we
should
be
trying
to
dig
out
the
answer
but
i
had
already
told
purdy
and
he
had
agreed
that
if
national
security
was
involved
we
would
drop
the
thing
completely
by
the
time
i
had
proved
the
balloon
answer
wrong
i
was
badly
puzzled
the
idea
of
a
disembodied
light
was
the
hardest
thing
to
swallow
that
i
come
across
so
far
and
yet
there
were
the
other
light
reports
the
strange
sighting
at
fairfield
suisan
field
the
weird
green
lights
at
las
vegas
and
albuquerque
and
there
was
the
encounter
that
lieutenant
combs
had
had
one
night
above
andrews
field
near
washington
this
incident
had
occurred
on
november
six
weeks
after
gorman
experience
combs
flying
with
another
lieutenant
named
jackson
was
about
to
land
his
at
when
a
strange
object
loomed
up
near
him
it
looked
like
a
grayish
globe
and
it
gave
off
an
odd
fuzzy
light
combs
chased
the
weird
object
for
over
ten
minutes
during
which
it
appeared
to
evade
every
move
he
made
once
its
speed
was
nearly
six
hundred
miles
an
hour
as
closely
as
he
could
estimate
in
a
final
attempt
to
identify
it
combs
zoomed
the
up
at
a
steep
angle
and
flashed
his
landing
lights
on
it
before
he
could
get
a
good
look
the
globe
light
whirled
off
to
the
east
and
vanished
since
combs
story
had
been
in
the
newspapers
project
saucer
evidently
had
felt
in
wise
to
give
some
explanation
when
i
read
it
in
the
preliminary
report
i
was
amazed
here
was
the
concluding
sentence
the
mystery
was
cleared
up
when
the
object
was
identified
positively
as
a
cluster
of
research
balloons
even
one
of
the
giant
balloons
would
have
been
hard
to
take
as
the
explanation
combs
was
almost
sure
to
have
collided
with
it
in
his
passes
but
an
entire
cluster
i
tried
to
picture
the
zooming
and
twisting
through
the
night
sky
with
several
huge
balloons
in
its
path
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
combs
got
through
without
hitting
one
of
them
even
if
each
balloon
was
lighted
but
he
had
seen
only
one
light
so
had
lieutenant
jackson
that
would
mean
all
the
rest
of
the
balloons
were
unlighted
an
unbelievable
coincidence
it
was
not
until
months
afterward
that
i
found
project
saucer
had
withdrawn
this
solution
in
its
final
report
this
case
number
was
listed
in
the
unidentified
group
how
the
explanation
ever
got
into
the
first
report
is
still
a
mystery
when
i
talked
with
gorman
i
told
him
i
was
baffled
by
the
idea
of
a
light
maneuvering
through
the
skies
with
no
airfoil
to
support
it
i
know
he
said
it
got
me
too
at
first
you
mean
you
know
the
answer
i
demanded
it
just
my
personal
opinion
said
gorman
but
i
rather
not
have
it
printed
you
see
i
got
some
ideas
from
all
the
questions
those
project
teams
asked
me
if
my
hunch
turns
out
to
be
right
i
might
be
talking
about
an
official
secret
i
tried
to
pry
some
hint
out
of
him
but
gorman
just
smiled
and
shook
his
head
i
can
tell
you
this
much
he
said
because
it
been
mentioned
in
print
there
was
thought
behind
every
move
the
light
made
it
any
gadget
making
it
veer
away
from
my
ship
how
do
you
know
that
because
it
reacted
differently
at
different
times
if
it
had
been
a
mechanical
control
it
would
have
turned
or
climbed
the
same
way
each
time
i
got
near
it
instead
it
was
as
if
some
intelligent
mind
was
directing
every
turn
like
a
game
of
chess
and
always
one
move
ahead
of
me
maybe
you
can
figure
out
the
rest
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
it
bothered
me
because
report
indicated
the
same
thing
i
had
a
strong
temptation
to
skip
the
research
and
tell
redell
what
gorman
had
told
me
but
redell
had
an
orderly
mind
and
he
did
like
to
be
pushed
reluctantly
i
gave
up
the
idea
i
had
a
feeling
redell
knew
the
answer
to
the
mystery
lights
and
it
was
easy
to
put
off
the
solution
the
letter
that
came
from
art
green
while
i
was
working
on
the
space
plans
did
make
it
easier
dear
keyhoe
just
heard
about
your
seattle
visit
that
fairfield
suisan
thing
is
on
the
level
several
air
force
pilots
have
told
me
about
it
when
you
get
to
fargo
ask
gorman
what
they
found
when
they
checked
his
ship
with
a
geiger
counter
if
he
says
it
was
negative
then
he
must
be
under
orders
i
happen
to
know
better
yours
art
green
chapter
xi
my
first
step
in
checking
on
our
space
plans
was
to
look
up
official
announcements
i
found
that
on
december
defense
secretary
james
forrestal
had
released
this
official
statement
the
earth
satellite
vehicle
program
which
is
being
carried
out
independently
by
each
military
service
has
been
assigned
to
the
committee
on
guided
missiles
for
to
provide
an
integrated
program
the
committee
has
recommended
that
current
efforts
be
limited
to
studies
and
component
design
areas
of
such
research
have
been
allocated
to
each
of
the
three
military
departments
appropriation
bills
had
already
provided
funds
for
space
exploration
plans
the
air
force
research
was
indicated
by
general
curtis
lemay
who
was
then
deputy
chief
of
air
staff
for
research
and
development
in
outlining
plans
for
an
air
engineering
design
center
at
wright
field
general
lemay
included
these
requisites
flight
and
survival
equipment
for
operations
including
space
vehicles
space
bases
and
devices
for
use
therein
the
idea
of
exploring
space
is
of
course
nothing
new
for
many
years
writers
of
imaginative
fiction
have
described
trips
to
the
moon
and
distant
planets
more
recently
comic
books
and
strips
have
gone
in
heavily
for
adventures
as
a
natural
result
of
this
the
first
serious
rocket
experiments
in
this
country
were
labeled
screwball
stunts
about
on
a
par
with
efforts
to
break
through
the
sonic
barrier
the
latter
had
been
proved
impossible
by
aeronautical
engineers
as
for
rocket
flight
it
was
too
silly
for
serious
consideration
pendray
goddard
and
other
rocket
pioneers
took
some
vicious
ridicule
before
america
woke
up
to
the
possibilities
meantime
german
scientists
had
gone
far
ahead
their
buzz
bomb
a
missile
was
just
the
beginning
even
the
devastating
which
soared
high
into
the
stratosphere
before
falling
on
england
was
just
a
step
in
their
tremendous
space
program
if
the
nazis
could
have
hung
on
a
year
or
two
more
the
war
might
have
had
a
grimly
different
ending
when
the
allies
seized
nazi
secrets
some
of
the
german
plans
were
revealed
among
them
was
one
for
a
huge
earth
satellite
from
this
base
which
would
circle
the
earth
some
five
hundred
miles
away
enormous
mirrors
would
focus
the
sun
rays
on
any
desired
spot
the
result
swift
fiery
destruction
of
any
city
or
base
refusing
to
surrender
first
publication
of
this
scheme
brought
the
usual
jeers
many
people
including
some
reputable
scientists
believed
it
had
been
just
a
propaganda
plan
that
even
goebbels
had
discarded
as
hopeless
then
the
pentagon
announced
the
earth
satellite
vehicle
program
along
with
plans
for
a
moon
rocket
the
artificial
satellite
is
to
be
a
large
projectile
in
its
upward
flight
it
will
have
to
reach
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
to
escape
the
pull
of
gravity
at
a
height
of
about
miles
special
controls
will
turn
the
projectile
and
cause
it
to
circle
the
earth
these
controls
will
be
either
automatic
or
operated
from
the
ground
by
radar
theoretically
once
such
a
vehicle
is
beyond
gravity
magnetism
it
can
coast
along
in
the
sky
forever
its
rocket
power
will
be
shut
off
the
only
need
for
such
power
would
be
if
the
satellite
veered
off
course
a
momentary
burst
from
the
jets
would
be
sufficient
to
bring
it
back
to
its
orbit
circling
the
earth
in
about
two
hours
this
first
satellite
is
expected
to
be
used
as
a
testing
station
instruments
will
record
and
transmit
vital
information
to
the
earth
the
effect
of
cosmic
rays
solar
radiation
fuel
required
for
course
corrections
and
many
other
items
a
second
space
base
farther
out
will
probably
be
the
next
step
it
may
be
manned
or
it
may
be
under
remote
control
like
the
first
perhaps
the
first
satellite
vehicle
will
be
followed
by
a
compartmented
operating
base
a
sort
of
aerial
aircraft
carrier
with
other
rocket
ships
operating
to
and
fro
on
the
earth
shuttle
the
moon
rocket
is
expected
to
add
to
our
information
about
space
so
that
finally
we
will
emerge
with
an
interplanetary
space
craft
the
first
attempts
may
fail
the
first
satellite
may
fall
back
and
have
to
be
guided
to
an
ocean
landing
or
its
controls
might
not
bring
it
into
the
planned
orbit
in
this
case
it
could
coast
on
out
into
space
and
be
lost
but
sooner
or
later
effective
controls
will
be
found
then
the
manned
space
ships
will
follow
once
in
free
space
there
will
be
no
gravitational
pull
to
offset
the
space
ship
and
everything
in
it
will
be
weightless
shielding
is
expected
to
prevent
danger
from
cosmic
rays
and
solar
radiation
the
danger
from
meteorites
has
been
partly
discounted
in
one
scientific
study
probability
that
a
meteorite
will
hit
or
penetrate
a
body
situated
in
the
vicinity
of
the
earth
by

vol

pp
october
in
this
study
it
is
stated
that
a
meteorite
is
unlikely
to
penetrate
the
thick
shell
our
space
vehicles
will
undoubtedly
have
however
this
applies
only
to
the
earth
atmosphere
longer
studies
using
vehicles
in
space
may
take
years
before
it
will
be
safe
to
launch
a
manned
space
ship
radar
or
other
devices
may
have
to
be
developed
to
detect
approaching
meteorites
at
a
distance
and
automatically
change
a
space
ship
course
the
change
required
would
be
infinitesimal
using
power
for

a

before
we
are

for
interplanetary

we
will
have
to
harness
atomic
power
or
some
other
force
not
now
available
such
as
cosmic
rays
navigation
at
such
tremendous
speeds
is
another
great
problem
on
which
special
groups
are
now
at

a

scientific

recently
found
that

other

may
be
similarly
identified
by
some

in

emanations
if
so
these
could
be
used
as

in

escape
from

even

according

with

some

believe

for
a

forever
the

would
be

simple

with
a
journey
outside

would

easier
than

our

it
is
a
ridiculous
assumption
but
even
if
atomic
power
or
some
force
such
as
cosmic
rays
made
an
approach
to
that
speed
possible
it
would
still
take
eight
years
to
reach
wolf
the

would
take

have

who
dispute
einstein

though
no
one
has
disproved
it
if
the

of

is
not
an
absolute
limit
for

ships
then

may
someday

otherwise
a

outside

could
be
a

most
space

would
probably
be
limited
to
the
planets
of
our

the

mars
venus
jupiter
and
the
others
although
it
may
be
many
years
before
the
first
manned
space
ship
leaves
the
earth
we
are
already
at
work
on
the
problems
the
crews
would
face
i
learned
some
of
the
details
from
a
navy
flight
surgeon
with
whom
i
had
talked
about
problems
they
a
lot
further
than
that
he
told
me
down
at
randolph
field
the
research
lab
has
run
into
some
mighty
queer
things
ever
hear
of
distance
no
that
a
new
one
well
it
sounds
crazy
but
they
figured
out
that
a
space
ship
would
be
going
faster
than
anyone
could
think
but
you
think
instantaneously
i
objected
oh
no
it
takes
a
fraction
of
a
second
even
for
the
fastest
thinker
let
say
the
ship
was
making
a
hundred
miles
a
second
and
that
slow
compared
with
what
they
expect
eventually
everything
would
happen
faster
than
your
nerve
impulses
could
register
it
your
comprehension
would
always
be
lagging
a
split
second
behind
the
space
ship
operation
i
do
see
why
that
so
serious
i
said
suppose
radar
or
some
other
device
warned
you
a
meteorite
was
coming
toward
you
or
maybe
some
instrument
indicated
an
error
in
navigation
by
the
time
your
mind
registered
the
thought
the
situation
would
have
changed
then
all
the
controls
would
have
to
be
automatic
i
said
i
told
him
that
i
had
heard
about
plans
for
avoiding
meteorites
electronic
controls
would
be
faster
than
thought
that
probably
the
answer
he
agreed
of
course
at
a
hundred
miles
a
second
it
might
not
be
too
serious
but
if
they
ever
get
up
to
speeds
like
a
thousand
miles
a
second
that
mental
lag
could
make
an
enormous
difference
whether
it
was
a
meteorite
heading
toward
you
or
a
matter
of
navigation
one
of
the
problems
he
mentioned
was
the
lack
of
gravity
i
had
already
learned
about
this
once
away
from
the
earth
pull
objects
in
the
space
ship
would
have
no
weight
the
slightest
push
could
send
crewmen
floating
around
the
sealed
compartment
suppose
you
spilled
a
cup
of
coffee
said
the
flight
surgeon
what
would
happen
i
said
i
had
thought
it
out
the
randolph
field
lab
can
tell
you
he
said
the
coffee
would
stay
right
there
in
the
air
so
would
the
cup
if
you
let
go
of
it
but
there
a
more
serious
angle
your
breath
you
have
artificial
air
i
began
yes
they
already
worked
that
out
but
what
about
the
breath
you
exhale
it
contains
carbon
dioxide
and
if
you
let
it
stay
right
there
in
front
of
your
face
you
be
sucking
it
back
into
your
lungs
after
a
while
it
would
asphyxiate
you
so
the
air
has
to
be
kept
in
motion
and
besides
that
the
ventilating
system
has
to
remove
the
carbon
dioxide
what
about
eating
i
asked
swallowing
is
partly
gravity
it
he
nodded
same
as
drinking
though
the
throat
muscles
help
force
the
food
down
i
do
know
the
answer
to
that
in
fact
everything
about
the
human
body
presents
a
problem
take
the
blood
circulation
the
amount
of
energy
required
to
pump
blood
through
the
veins
would
be
almost
negligible
what
would
that
do
to
your
heart
i
could
even
guess
i
said
well
that
all
the
lab
can
do
guess
at
it
been
trying
to
work
out
some
way
of
duplicating
the
effect
of
zero
gravity
but
there
just
no
answer
if
you
could
build
a
machine
to
neutralize
gravity
you
could
get
all
the
answers
except
to
the
distance
question
for
instance
there
the
matter
of
whether
the
human
body
would
even
function
without
gravity
all
down
through
the
stages
of
evolution
man
organs
have
been
used
to
that
downward
pull
take
away
gravity
and
your
whole
body
might
stop
working
some
of
the
men
i
talked
with
do
believe
that
but
they
admit
that
long
trips
outside
of
gravity
might
have
odd
effects
then
there
the
question
of
orientation
here
on
earth
orienting
yourself
depends
on
the
feeling
you
get
from
the
pull
of
gravity
plus
your
vision
just
being
blindfolded
is
enough
to
disorient
some
people
taking
away
the
pull
of
gravity
might
be
a
lot
worse
and
of
course
out
in
space
your
only
reference
points
would
be
distant
stars
and
planets
we
been
used
to
locating
stars
from
points
on
the
earth
where
we
know
their
position
but
how
about
locating
them
from
out
in
space
with
a
ship
moving
at
great
speed
inside
the
space
ship
it
would
be
something
like
being
in
a
submarine
probably
only
the
pilot
compartment
would
have
glass
ports
and
those
would
be
covered
except
in
landing
maybe
even
then
outside
vision
might
be
by
television
so
you
could
break
a
glass
port
and
let
out
your
pressure
but
to
go
back
to
the
submarine
idea
it
would
be
like
a
sub
with
this
big
difference
in
the
submarine
you
can
generally
tell
which
way
is
down
except
maybe
in
a
crash
dive
when
you
may
lose
your
equilibrium
for
a
moment
but
in
the
space
ship
you
could
be
standing
with
your
feet
on
one
spot
and
another
crewman
might
be
relative
to
you
standing
upside
down
you
might
be
floating
horizontally
the
other
man
vertically
the
more
you
think
about
it
the
crazier
it
gets
but
they
got
to
solve
all
those
problems
before
we
can
tackle
space
to
make
sure
i
had
the
details
right
i
checked
on
the
air
force
research
i
found
that
the
randolph
field
laboratory
is
working
on
all
these
problems
and
many
more
although
plans
arc
not
far
enough
advanced
to
make
it
certain
probably
animals
will
be
sent
up
in
research
rockets
to
determine
the
effect
of
no
gravity
before
any
human
beings
make
such
flights
the
results
could
be
televised
back
to
the
earth
all
through
my
on
space
exploration
plans
one
thing
struck
me
i
met
no
resistance
there
was
no
official
reticence
about
the
program
on
the
contrary
nothing
about
it
seemed
secret
even
though
it
was
peacetime
this
was
a
little
curious
because
of
the
potential
war
value
of
an
earth
satellite
vehicle
even
if
the
nazi
scheme
for
destruction
proved
just
a
dream
an
orbiting
space
base
could
be
used
for
other
purposes
in
its
swing
around
the
earth
practically
all
of
the
globe
could
be
by
powerful
telescopes
or
indirectly
by
a
combination
of
radar
and
television
missiles
could
be
guided
to
targets
after
being
launched
from
some
point
on
the
earth
as
the
missiles
climbed
high
into
the
stratosphere
the
satellite
radar
could
pick
them
up
and
keep
them
on
course
by
remote
control
there
were
other
possibilities
for
both
attack
and
defense
ordinarily
projects
with
wartime
value
are
kept
under
wraps
or
at
least
not
widely
publicized
of
course
the
explanation
might
be
very
simple
the
completion
of
the
satellite
vehicle
was
so
remote
that
there
seemed
no
need
for
secrecy
but
in
that
case
why
had
the
program
been
announced
at
all
if
the
purpose
had
been
propaganda
it
looked
like
a
weak
gesture
the
soviets
would
not
be
greatly
worried
by
a
dream
weapon
forty
or
fifty
years
off
besides
that
the
pentagon
as
a
rule
does
go
for
such
propaganda
there
was
only
one
conventional
answer
that
made
any
sense
if
we
had
heard
that
the
soviets
were
about
to
announce
such
a
program
as
a
propaganda
trick
it
would
be
smart
to
beat
them
to
it
but
i
had
no
proof
of
any
such
russian
intention
the
date
on
secretary
forrestal
announcement
was
december
one
day
later
the
order
creating
project
saucer
had
been
signed
that
did
prove
anything
winding
up
the
year
forrestal
could
have
signed
a
hundred
orders
i
was
getting
too
suspicious
at
any
rate
i
had
now
analyzed
the
gorman
case
and
checked
on
our
space
plans
tomorrow
i
would
see
redell
and
find
out
what
he
knew
chapter
xii
i
called
redell
office
i
found
he
had
flown
to
dallas
and
would
not
be
back
for
two
days
by
the
time
he
returned
i
had
written
a
draft
of
the
gorman
case
with
my
answer
to
the
balloon
explanation
when
i
saw
him
the
next
morning
i
asked
him
to
look
it
over
redell
lighted
his
pipe
and
then
read
the
draft
nodding
to
himself
now
and
then
i
think
that
correct
analysis
he
said
when
he
finished
that
was
a
very
curious
case
you
know
project
even
had
psychiatrists
out
there
if
gorman
had
been
the
only
witness
i
think
they
have
called
it
a
hallucination
as
it
was
they
took
a
crack
at
him
and
the
men
in
their
preliminary
report
though
i
recalled
that
there
had
been
a
comment
i
did
remember
the
wording
redell
looked
it
up
and
read
it
aloud
a
psychological
aspect
the
gorman
incident
raised
the
question
is
it
possible
for
an
object
without
appreciable
shape
or
known
aeronautical
configuration
to
appear
to
travel
at
variable
speeds
and
maneuver
intelligently
hallucination
might
sound
like
a
logical
answer
i
said
until
you
check
all
the
testimony
but
there
are
just
too
many
witnesses
who
confirm
gorman
report
also
he
seems
like
a
pretty
chap
redell
filled
his
pipe
again
but
you
still
ca
quite
accept
it
i
positive
they
saw
the
light
but
what
the
devil
was
it
how
could
it
fly
without
some
kind
of
airfoil
maybe
it
did
you
remember
gorman
described
an
odd
fuzziness
around
the
edge
of
the
light
it
in
this
air
force
report
that
could
have
been
a
reflection
from
the
airfoil
yes
but
gorman
would
have
seen
any
solid
i
stopped
as
redell
made
a
negative
gesture
it
could
be
solid
and
still
not
show
up
he
said
you
mean
it
was
transparent
sure
that
would
do
it
let
say
the
airfoil
was
a
rotating
plastic
disk
absolutely
transparent
the
blurred
fuzzy
look
could
have
been
caused
by
the
whirling
disk
neither
gorman
nor
the
men
in
the
tower
could
possibly
see
the
disk
itself
paul
i
think
you
hit
it
i
said
i
can
see
thc
rest
of
it
the
thing
was
under
remote
control
radio
or
radar
and
from
the
way
it
flew
rings
around
gorman
whoever
controlled
it
must
have
been
able
to
see
the
either
with
a
television
or
by
radar
or
by
some
means
we
do
understand
said
redell
he
went
on
carefully
in
all
these
saucer
cases
keep
this
in
mind
we
may
be
dealing
with
some
totally
unknown
principle
something
completely
beyond
our
comprehension
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
was
hunting
at
some
radical
discovery
by
soviet
captured
nazi
scientists
then
i
realized
what
he
meant
you
think
they
interplanetary
i
murmured
why
not
redell
looked
surprised
is
that
your
idea
i
got
that
impression
yes
but
i
did
think
you
believed
it
when
you
said
to
check
on
our
space
plans
i
thought
you
had
some
secret
missile
in
mind
no
i
had
another
reason
i
wanted
you
to
see
all
the
problems
involved
in
space
travel
if
you
accept
the
interplanetary
answer
you
have
to
accept
this
too
whoever
is
looking
us
over
has
licked
all
those
problems
years
ago
technically
they
be
hundreds
of
years
ahead
of
us
maybe
thousands
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
what
they
be
up
to
here
when
i
mentioned
the
old
sighting
reports
i
found
that
redell
already
knew
about
them
he
was
convinced
that
the
earth
had
been
under
observation
a
long
time
probably
even
before
the
first
recorded
sightings
i
know
some
of
those
reports
are
authentic
he
admitted
but
if
you
accept
even
one
report
of
a
flying
disk
or
object
before
the
twentieth
century
then
you
have
to
accept
the
basic
idea
in
the
last
forty
years
you
might
blame
the
reports
on
planes
and
dirigibles
but
there
was
no
propelled
aircraft
until
either
all
those
early
sightings
were
wrong
or
some
kind
of
fast
aerial
machine
has
been
flying
periodically
over
the
earth
for
at
least
two
centuries
i
told
him
i
was
pretty
well
convinced
but
that
true
faced
a
problem
there
was
some
conflicting
evidence
and
part
of
it
seemed
linked
with
guided
missiles
i
felt
sure
we
could
prove
the
answer
but
we
had
to
stay
clear
of
discussing
any
weapons
that
were
still
a
secret
i
ca
believe
that
guided
missiles
are
the
answer
to
the
godman
field
saucer
and
the
case
or
this
business
at
fargo
but
we
got
to
be
absolutely
sure
before
we
print
anything
well
let
analyze
it
said
redell
let
see
if
all
the
saucers
could
be
explained
as
something
launched
from
the
earth
he
reached
for
a
pad
and
a
pencil
first
let
take
your
rotating
disk
that
would
be
a
lot
simpler
to
build
than
the
stationary
disk
with
variable
jet
nozzles
with
a
disk
rotated
at
high
speed
you
get
a
tremendous
lift
whether
it
slotted
or
cambered
as
long
as
there
enough
air
to
work
on
the
helicopter
principle
i
said
redell
nodded
the
most
practical
propulsion
would
be
with
two
or
more
jets
out
on
the
rim
to
spin
your
rotating
section
but
to
get
up
enough
speed
for
the
jets
to
be
efficient
you
have
to
whirl
the
disk
mechanically
before
the
here
one
way
you
could
have
a
square
hole
in
the
center
then
the
disk
launching
device
would
have
a
square
shaft
rotated
by
an
engine
or
a
motor
as
the
speed
built
up
the
cambered
disk
would
ride
up
the
shaft
and
free
itself
rising
vertically
with
the
jets
taking
over
the
job
of
whirling
the
cambered
section
the
lift
would
be
terrific
far
more
than
any
normal
aircraft
i
do
believe
any
human
being
could
take
the
g
involved
in
a
maximum
power
climb
they
have
to
use
remote
control
when
it
got
to
the
desired
altitude
your
disk
could
be
flown
in
any
direction
by
tilting
it
that
way
the
forward
component
from
that
tremendous
lift
would
result
in
a
very
high
speed
the
disk
could
also
hover
and
descend
vertically
what
about
maneuvering
i
asked
thinking
of
gorman
experience
it
could
turn
faster
than
any
pilot
could
stand
said
redell
of
course
a
pilot
cockpit
could
be
built
into
a
large
disk
but
there
have
to
be
some
way
of
holding
down
the
speed
to
avoid
too
many
g
in
tight
maneuvers
most
of
the
disks
do
make
any
noise
i
said
at
least
the
general
report
you
hear
ordinary
jets
for
miles
right
and
here
another
angle
ram
jets
take
a
lot
of
fuel
even
with
some
highly
efficient
new
jet
i
ca
see
the
long
ranges
reported
some
of
these
saucers
have
been
seen
all
over
the
world
no
matter
which
hemisphere
they
were
launched
from
they
need
an
range
at
least
to
explain
all
of
the
sightings
the
only
apparent
answer
would
be
some
new
kind
of
power
probably
atomic
we
certainly
did
have
atomic
engines
for
aircraft
in
when
the
first
disks
were
seen
here
and
we
do
have
them
now
though
we
working
on
it
even
if
we
had
such
an
engine
it
be
tiny
enough
to
power
the
small
disks
anyway
i
said
we
hardly
be
flying
them
all
over
everywhere
the
cost
would
be
enormous
and
there
always
be
a
danger
of
somebody
getting
the
secret
if
a
disk
landed
plus
the
risk
of
injuring
people
by
radiation
just
imagine
an
disk
dropping
into
a
city
the
whole
ridiculous
that
seems
to
rule
out
the
answer
i
began
but
redell
shook
his
head
missiles
are
quite
feasible
i
talking
about
range
speed
and
performance
imagine
for
a
moment
that
we
have
missiles
using
the
latest
jet
or
rocket
propulsion
either
piloted
or
the
question
is
could
such
disks
fit
specific
sightings
like
the
one
at
godman
field
and
the
case
at
fargo
redell
paused
as
if
some
new
thought
had
struck
him
wait
a
minute
here
an
even
better
test
i
happen
to
know
about
this
case
personally
marvin
miles
he
an
aviation
writer
in
los
angeles
was
down
at
white
sands
proving
ground
some
time
ago
he
talked
with
a
navy
rocket
expert
who
was
in
charge
of
naval
projects
this
navy
man
he
a
commander
in
the
regular
service
told
miles
they
seen
four
saucers
down
in
that
area
you
sure
he
was
kidding
miles
i
said
then
i
remembered
purdy
tip
about
a
white
sands
case
i
told
you
i
checked
on
this
myself
redell
said
a
little
annoyed
after
miles
told
me
about
it
i
asked
an
engineer
who
been
down
there
if
it
was
true
he
gave
me
the
same
story
figures
and
all
the
first
saucer
was
tracked
by
white
sands
observers
with
a
theodolite
then
they
worked
out
its
performance
with
ballistics
formulas
redell
looked
at
me
grimly
the
thing
was
about
fifty
miles
up
and
it
was
making
over
fifteen
thousand
miles
an
hour
one
of
the
witnesses
said
redell
was
a
scientist
from
the
general
mills
aeronautical
research
laboratory
in
minneapolis
which
was
working
with
the
navy
a
few
days
later
i
verified
this
fact
and
the
basic
details
of
redell
account
but
it
was
not
until
early
in
january
that
i
finally
identified
the
officer
as
commander
robert
mclaughlin
and
got
his
dramatic
story
here
are
two
more
items
miles
told
me
redell
went
on
this
navy
expert
said
the
saucer
actually
looked
elliptical
or
and
while
it
was
being
tracked
it
suddenly
made
a
steep
climb
so
steep
no
human
being
could
have
lived
through
it
one
thing
is
certain
i
said
that
altitude
knocks
out
the
rotating
disk
up
in
that
thin
air
it
would
have
any
lift
right
said
redell
and
the
variable
jet
type
would
require
an
enormous
amount
of
fuel
regardless
those
g
mean
it
could
have
had
any
pilot
born
on
this
earth
according
to
marvin
miles
this
white
sands
saucer
had
been
over
a
hundred
feet
long
later
commander
mclaughlin
stated
that
it
was
feet
if
this
were
an
american
device
then
it
meant
that
we
had
already
licked
many
of
the
problems
on
which
the
earth
satellite
vehicle
designers
were
supposed
to
be
just
starting
their
statements
then
would
have
to
be
false
part
of
an
elaborate
if
we
had
such
an
advanced
design
said
redell
and
i
just
believe
it
possible
would
we
gamble
on
a
system
no
such
system
is
perfect
suppose
it
went
wrong
at
that
speed
over
fifteen
thousand
miles
an
hour
your
precious
missile
or
strato
ship
could
be
halfway
around
the
globe
in
about
minutes
that
is
if
the
fuel
held
out
before
you
could
regain
control
you
might
lose
it
in
the
sea
or
it
might
come
down
behind
the
iron
curtain
even
if
it
were
i
smashed
to
bits
it
would
tip
off
the
soviets
they
might
claim
it
was
a
attack
almost
anything
could
hap
pen
it
could
have
a
time
bomb
in
it
i
suggested
if
it
got
off
course
or
out
of
control
it
would
blow
itself
up
redell
emphatically
shook
his
head
i
heard
that
idea
before
but
it
wo
hold
up
what
if
your
ship
controls
went
haywire
and
the
thing
blew
up
over
a
crowded
city
imagine
the
panic
even
if
no
actual
damage
was
done
no
sir
nobody
in
his
right
mind
is
going
to
let
a
huge
ship
like
that
go
barging
around
unpiloted
it
would
be
criminal
negligence
if
the
white
sands
calculations
were
correct
then
this
particular
saucer
was
no
device
perhaps
in
coming
years
we
could
produce
such
a
ship
with
atomic
power
to
drive
it
but
not
now
redell
went
over
several
other
cases
take
the
godman
field
saucer
at
one
time
it
was
seen
at
places
one
hundred
and
miles
apart
as
you
know
even
to
have
been
seen
at
all
from
both
places
it
would
have
to
have
been
huge
much
larger
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
diameter
the
human
eye
would
resolve
an
object
that
size
at
such
a
distance
and
height
it
was
an
odd
thing
i
had
gone
over
the
mantell
case
a
dozen
times
i
knew
the
object
was
huge
but
i
had
never
tried
to
figure
out
the
object
exact
size
how
big
do
you
think
it
was
i
asked
quickly
this
could
be
the
key
i
had
tried
to
find
i
have
worked
it
out
said
redell
but
i
can
give
you
a
rough
idea
the
human
eye
ca
resolve
any
object
that
subtends
less
than
three
minutes
of
arc
for
instance
a
plane
with
a
wing
span
would
only
be
a
speck
twenty
miles
away
if
you
saw
it
at
all
but
this
thing
was
seen
clearly
miles
away
or
even
more
if
it
was
midway
between
the
two
cities
why
it
would
have
to
be
a
thousand
feet
in
diameter
even
larger
redell
was
silent
a
moment
what
was
the
word
mantell
used
i
tried
to
visualize
the
thing
but
my
mind
balked
one
thing
was
certain
now
it
was
utterly
impossible
that
any
nation
on
earth
could
have
built
such
an
enormous
airborne
machine
just
to
think
of
the
force
required
to
hold
it
in
the
sky
was
enough
to
stagger
any
engineer
we
were
years
away
perhaps
centuries
from
any
such
possibility
as
if
he
had
read
my
thoughts
redell
said
soberly
there
no
other
possible
answer
it
was
a
huge
space
ship
perhaps
the
largest
ever
to
come
into
our
atmosphere
it
was
clear
now
why
such
desperate
efforts
had
been
made
to
explain
away
the
object
mantell
had
chased
what
about
that
eastern
airlines
sighting
i
asked
well
first
said
redell
it
was
any
guided
missile
i
say
it
again
it
would
be
sheer
insanity
suppose
that
thing
had
crashed
in
macon
at
that
speed
it
could
have
plowed
its
way
for
blocks
right
through
the
buildings
it
could
have
killed
hundreds
of
people
burned
the
heart
out
of
the
city
if
it
was
a
missile
or
some
experimental
job
then
it
was
piloted
but
they
do
test
a
job
like
that
on
any
commercial
airways
and
they
do
fool
around
at
five
thousand
feet
where
people
will
see
the
thing
streaking
by
and
call
the
newspapers
to
power
a
wingless
ship
especially
at
those
speeds
would
take
enormous
force
not
as
much
as
a
rocket
but
tremendous
power
the
fuel
load
would
be
terrific
certainly
the
pilot
would
be
circling
around
georgia
and
alabama
for
an
hour
buzzing
airliners
i
stake
everything
that
we
could
duplicate
that
space
ship
performance
for
less
than
fifty
million
dollars
it
would
take
something
in
jets
redell
paused
he
looked
at
me
grimly
and
the
way
i
have
to
soup
it
up
it
would
be
a
damned
dangerous
ship
to
fly
no
pilot
would
deliberately
fly
it
that
low
he
stay
up
where
he
have
a
chance
to
bail
out
i
told
him
what
i
had
heard
about
the
blueprints
the
air
force
was
said
to
have
rushed
of
course
they
were
worried
said
redell
and
probably
they
still
are
but
i
do
think
they
need
be
so
far
there
been
nothing
menacing
about
these
space
ships
when
i
got
him
back
to
the
gorman
case
redell
drew
a
sketch
on
his
pad
showing
me
his
idea
of
the
disk
light
he
estimated
the
transparent
rim
as
not
more
than
five
feet
in
diameter
possibly
smaller
he
said
you
recall
that
gorman
said
the
light
was
between
six
and
eight
inches
in
diameter
he
also
said
it
seemed
to
have
depth
that
was
in
the
air
force
report
you
think
all
the
mechanism
was
hidden
by
the
light
only
possible
answer
said
redell
but
just
try
to
imagine
crowding
a
motor
or
jet
controls
for
rim
jets
along
with
remote
controls
and
a
television
device
in
that
small
space
plus
your
fuel
supply
i
do
know
any
engineer
who
would
even
attempt
it
to
carry
that
much
gear
it
would
take
a
plane
you
could
make
a
disk
large
enough
but
the
mechanism
and
fuel
section
would
be
two
or
three
feet
across
at
least
so
gorman
light
must
have
been
powered
and
controlled
by
some
unique
means
the
same
principle
applies
to
all
the
other
light
reports
i
heard
no
shape
behind
them
high
speed
and
intelligent
maneuvers
that
thing
was
guided
from
some
interplanetary
ship
hovering
at
a
high
altitude
redell
declared
but
i
any
idea
what
source
of
power
it
used
until
then
i
had
forgotten
about
art
green
letter
i
told
redell
what
art
had
said
about
the
geiger
counter
i
knew
they
went
over
gorman
fighter
with
a
geiger
counter
redell
commented
but
they
said
the
reaction
was
negative
if
green
is
right
it
interesting
it
would
mean
they
have
built
incredibly
small
atomic
engines
but
with
a
race
so
many
years
ahead
of
us
it
should
be
surprising
of
course
they
may
also
be
using
some
other
kind
of
power
our
scientists
say
is
impossible
i
was
about
to
ask
him
what
he
meant
when
his
secretary
came
in
carson
is
waiting
she
told
redell
he
had
a
appointment
as
i
started
to
leave
redell
looked
at
his
calendar
i
hate
to
break
this
up
it
a
fascinating
business
what
about
coming
in
friday
i
like
to
see
the
rest
of
those
case
reports
fine
i
said
i
got
a
few
more
questions
too
going
out
i
made
a
mental
note
of
the
friday
date
then
the
figure
clicked
it
was
just
three
months
since
i
started
on
this
assignment
three
months
ago
at
that
time
i
only
been
half
sure
that
the
saucers
were
real
if
anyone
had
said
i
soon
believe
they
were
space
ships
i
have
told
him
he
was
crazy
chapter
xiii
before
my
date
with
redell
i
went
over
all
the
material
i
had
hoping
to
find
some
clue
to
the
space
visitors
planet
it
was
possible
of
course
that
there
was
more
than
one
planet
involved
project
saucer
had
discussed
the
possibilities
in
it
report
of
april
i
read
over
this
section
again
since
flying
saucers
first
hit
the
headlines
almost
two
years
ago
there
has
been
wide
speculation
that
the
aerial
phenomena
might
actually
be
some
form
of
penetration
from
another
planet
actually
astronomers
are
largely
in
agreement
that
only
one
member
of
the
solar
system
beside
earth
is
capable
of
supporting
life
that
is
mars
even
mars
however
appears
to
be
relatively
desolate
and
inhospitable
so
that
a
martian
race
would
be
more
occupied
with
survival
than
we
are
on
earth
on
mars
there
exists
an
excessively
slow
loss
of
atmosphere
oxygen
and
water
against
which
intelligent
beings
if
they
do
exist
there
may
have
protected
themselves
by
scientific
control
of
physical
conditions
this
might
have
been
done
scientists
speculate
by
the
construction
of
homes
and
cities
underground
where
the
atmospheric
pressure
would
be
greater
and
thus
temperature
extremes
reduced
the
other
possibilities
exist
of
course
that
evolution
may
have
developed
a
being
who
can
withstand
the
rigors
of
the
martian
climate
or
that
the
race
if
it
ever
did
exist
has
perished
in
other
words
the
existence
of
intelligent
life
on
mars
where
the
rare
atmosphere
is
nearly
devoid
of
oxygen
and
water
and
where
the
nights
are
much
colder
than
our
arctic
winters
is
not
impossible
but
is
completely
unproven
the
possibility
of
intelligent
life
also
existing
on
the
planet
venus
is
not
considered
completely
unreasonable
by
astronomers
the
atmosphere
of
venus
apparently
consists
mostly
of
carbon
dioxide
with
deep
clouds
of
formaldehyde
droplets
and
there
seems
to
be
little
or
no
water
yet
scientists
concede
that
living
organisms
might
develop
in
chemical
environments
which
are
strange
to
us
venus
however
has
two
handicaps
her
mass
and
gravity
are
nearly
as
large
as
the
earth
mars
is
smaller
and
her
cloudy
atmosphere
would
discourage
astronomy
hence
space
travel
the
last
argument
i
thought
did
not
have
too
much
weight
we
were
planning
to
escape
the
earth
gravity
martians
could
do
the
same
with
their
planet
as
for
the
cloudy
atmosphere
they
could
have
developed
some
system
of
radio
or
radar
investigation
of
the
universe
the
navy
research
units
i
knew
were
probing
the
crab
nebula
in
the
milky
way
with
special
radio
devices
this
same
method
or
something
far
superior
could
have
been
developed
on
venus
or
other
planets
surrounded
by
constant
clouds
after
the
discussion
of
planets
the
project
saucer
report
went
on
to
other
star
systems
outside
the
solar
system
other
stars
in
number
have
satellite
planets
our
sun
has
nine
one
of
these
the
earth
is
ideal
for
existence
of
intelligent
life
on
two
others
there
is
a
possibility
of
life
therefore
astronomers
believe
reasonable
the
thesis
that
there
could
be
at
least
one
ideally
habitable
planet
for
each
of
the
other
eligible
stars
after
publication
of
our
findings
in
true
several
astronomers
said
that
many
planets
may
be
inhabited
one
of
these
was
carl
von
weizacker
noted
university
of
chicago
physicist
on
january
von
weizacker
stated
billions
upon
billions
of
stars
found
in
the
heavens
may
each
have
their
own
planets
revolving
about
them
it
is
possible
that
these
planets
would
have
plant
and
animal
life
on
them
similar
to
the
earth
after
narrowing
the
eligible
stars
down
to
the
project
saucer
report
goes
on
the
theory
is
also
employed
that
man
represents
the
average
in
advancement
and
development
therefore
the
other
habitable
planets
would
be
behind
man
in
development
and
the
other
half
ahead
it
is
also
assumed
that
any
visiting
race
could
be
expected
to
be
far
in
advance
of
man
thus
the
chance
of
space
travelers
existing
at
planets
attached
to
neighboring
stars
is
very
much
greater
than
the
chance
of
martians
the
one
can
be
viewed
as
almost
a
certainty
if
you
accept
the
thesis
that
the
number
of
inhabited
planets
is
equal
to
those
that
are
suitable
for
life
and
that
intelligent
life
is
not
peculiar
to
the
earth
the
most
likely
star
was
wolf
eight
away
i
thought
for
a
minute
about
traveling
that
vast
distance
it
was
almost
appalling
considered
in
terms
of
man
life
span
of
course
dwellers
on
other
planets
might
live
much
longer
if
the
speed
of
light
was
not
an
absolute
limit
almost
any
space
journey
would
then
be
possible
since
there
would
be
no
resistance
in
outer
space
it
would
be
simply
a
matter
of
using
rocket
power
in
the
first
stages
to
accelerate
to
the
maximum
speed
desired
in
the
latter
phase
the
rocket
drive
would
have
to
be
reversed
to
decelerate
for
the
landing
the
night
before
my
appointment
with
redell
i
was
checking
a
case
report
when
the
phone
rang
it
was
john
steele
are
you
still
working
on
the
saucers
he
asked
if
you
are
i
have
a
suggestion
something
that
might
be
a
real
lead
i
could
use
a
lead
right
now
i
told
him
i
ca
give
you
the
source
but
it
one
i
consider
reliable
said
steele
this
man
says
the
disks
are
british
developments
this
was
a
new
one
i
had
considered
the
british
steele
talked
for
over
half
an
hour
expanding
the
idea
the
saucers
his
informant
said
were
rotating
disks
with
cambered
surfaces
originally
a
nazi
device
near
the
end
of
the
war
the
british
had
seized
all
the
models
along
with
the
german
technicians
and
scientists
who
had
worked
on
the
project
the
first
british
types
had
been
developed
secretly
in
england
according
to
this
account
but
the
first
tests
showed
a
dangerous
lack
of
control
the
disks
streaked
up
to
high
altitudes
hurtling
without
direction
some
had
been
seen
over
the
atlantic
some
in
turkey
spain
and
other
parts
of
europe
the
british
then
had
shifted
operations
to
australia
where
a
test
range
had
been
set
up
this
part
i
knew
could
be
true
there
was
such
a
range
after
improving
their
system
which
used
both
radio
and
radar
they
had
built
disks
up
to
a
hundred
feet
in
diameter
these
were
launched
out
over
the
pacific
the
first
ones
straight
eastward
over
open
sea
british
destroyers
were
stationed
at
and
later
intervals
to
track
the
missiles
by
radar
and
correct
their
courses
at
a
set
time
when
their
fuel
was
almost
exhausted
the
disks
came
down
vertically
and
landed
in
the
ocean
since
part
of
the
device
was
sealed
the
disks
would
float
then
a
special
launching
ship
would
hoist
them
abroad
refuel
them
and
launch
them
back
toward
a
remote
base
in
australia
where
they
were
landed
by
remote
control
since
then
steele
said
the
disks
range
and
speed
had
been
greatly
increased
the
first
tests
of
the
new
disks
was
in
the
spring
of
his
informant
had
told
him
the
british
had
rushed
the
project
because
of
soviet
russia
menacing
attitude
their
only
defense
in
england
the
british
knew
would
be
some
powerful
guided
missile
that
could
destroy
soviet
bases
after
the
first
attack
in
order
to
check
the
range
and
speeds
accurately
it
was
necessary
to
have
observers
in
the
western
hemisphere
the
disks
were
now
traversing
the
pacific
the
ideal
test
range
the
british
decided
was
one
extending
over
canada
where
the
disks
could
be
tracked
and
even
landed
if
the
account
was
right
said
steele
a
base
had
been
set
up
in
the
desolate
hudson
bay
country
special
stations
had
also
been
established
to
guide
the
missiles
toward
australia
and
vessels
at
sea
these
stations
also
helped
to
bring
in
missiles
from
australia
some
of
the
disk
missiles
were
supposed
to
have
been
launched
from
a
british
island
in
the
south
pacific
others
came
all
the
way
from
australia
still
others
were
believed
to
have
been
launched
by
a
mother
ship
stationed
between
the
galapagos
islands
and
pitcairn
it
was
these
new
disks
that
had
been
seen
in
the
united
states
alaska
canada
and
latin
america
steele
informant
had
told
him
at
first
the
sightings
were
due
to
imperfect
controls
the
disks
sometimes
failed
to
keep
their
altitude
partly
because
of
conflicting
radio
and
radar
beams
from
the
countries
below
responding
to
some
of
these
mixed
signals
steele
said
the
disks
had
been
known
to
reverse
course
hover
or
descend
over
radar
and
radio
stations
or
circle
around
at
high
speeds
until
their
own
control
system
picked
them
up
again
for
this
reason
the
british
had
arranged
a
simple
detonator
system
operated
either
by
remote
control
or
automatically
under
certain
conditions
in
this
way
no
disk
would
crash
over
land
with
the
danger
of
hitting
a
populated
area
if
it
descended
below
a
certain
altitude
the
disk
would
automatically
speed
up
its
rotation
then
explode
at
a
high
altitude
when
radar
trackers
saw
that
a
disk
was
off
course
and
could
not
be
realigned
the
nearest
station
then
sent
a
special
signal
to
activate
the
detonator
system
this
was
always
done
steele
had
been
told
when
a
disk
headed
toward
siberia
there
had
previously
been
a
few
cases
when
disks
had
got
away
from
controllers
and
appeared
over
europe
i
listened
to
steele
account
with
mixed
astonishment
and
suspicion
it
sounded
like
a
pipe
dream
but
if
it
was
it
had
been
carefully
thought
out
especially
the
details
that
followed
at
first
steele
said
american
defense
officials
had
been
completely
baffled
by
the
disk
reports
then
the
british
learning
about
the
sightings
had
hastily
explained
to
american
officials
an
agreement
had
been
worked
out
we
were
to
have
the
benefit
of
their
research
and
testing
and
working
models
in
return
for
helping
to
conceal
the
secret
we
were
also
to
aid
in
tracking
and
controlling
the
missiles
when
they
passed
over
this
country
and
i
gather
we
paid
in
other
ways
steele
said
my
source
says
this
played
a
big
part
in
increasing
our
aid
to
britain
including
certain
atomic
secrets
that
could
make
sense
sharing
such
a
secret
would
be
worth
all
the
money
and
supplies
we
had
poured
into
england
if
america
and
great
britain
both
had
a
superior
missile
it
would
be
the
biggest
factor
i
knew
for
holding
off
war
but
the
long
ranges
involved
in
steele
explanation
made
the
thing
incredible
how
are
they
powered
what
fuel
do
they
use
i
asked
him
that
the
one
thing
i
could
get
said
steele
this
man
told
me
it
was
the
most
carefully
guarded
secret
of
all
they
tapped
a
new
source
of
power
if
he
means
atomic
engines
i
said
i
do
believe
it
i
think
anyone
is
that
far
along
no
no
steele
said
earnestly
he
said
it
was
that
and
the
rest
of
the
story
hangs
together
privately
i
thought
of
two
or
three
holes
but
i
let
that
go
if
it
british
i
said
do
you
think
we
should
even
hint
at
it
i
do
see
any
harm
steele
answered
the
russians
undoubtedly
know
the
truth
they
have
agents
everywhere
it
might
do
a
lot
of
good
for
relations
anyway
it
would
offset
any
fear
that
the
saucers
are
soviet
weapons
then
you
not
worried
about
that
angle
any
more
steele
laughed
no
but
it
had
me
going
for
a
while
it
was
a
big
relief
to
find
out
the
disks
are
british
what
the
disks
ceiling
i
asked
abruptly
oh
sixty
thousand
feet
at
least
said
steele
after
a
moment
he
added
quickly
that
just
a
guess
they
probably
operate
much
higher
i
did
think
to
ask
before
i
hung
up
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
british
explanation
it
certainly
more
plausible
than
the
soviet
idea
i
said
i
thanked
him
for
calling
me
and
put
down
the
phone
i
was
tempted
to
point
out
the
flaws
in
his
story
but
i
did
if
he
was
sincere
it
would
be
poor
thanks
for
what
he
had
told
me
if
he
was
trying
to
plant
a
fake
explanation
it
would
hurt
to
let
him
think
i
swallowed
it
when
i
saw
redell
i
told
him
about
steele
it
does
look
like
an
attempt
to
steer
you
away
from
the
interplanetary
answer
redell
agreed
though
he
may
be
passing
on
a
tip
he
believes
you
think
there
could
be
any
truth
in
the
british
story
would
the
british
risk
a
disk
crashing
in
some
american
city
said
redell
no
remote
control
is
perfect
and
neither
is
a
detonator
system
by
some
freak
accident
a
disk
might
come
down
in
a
place
like
chicago
and
then
blow
up
i
just
ca
see
the
british
any
more
than
ourselves
letting
huge
unpiloted
missiles
go
barging
around
the
world
flying
along
airways
and
over
cities
certainly
they
could
have
automatic
devices
to
make
them
veer
away
from
airliners
but
what
if
a
circuit
failed
i
go
along
with
that
i
said
i
do
say
the
british
do
have
some
missiles
redell
broke
in
every
big
nation
has
a
project
but
no
guided
missile
on
earth
can
explain
the
mantell
case
and
the
others
we
discussed
i
showed
him
the
material
i
had
on
the
nazi
disk
experiments
redell
skimmed
through
it
and
nodded
i
can
tell
you
a
little
more
he
said
some
top
nazi
scientists
were
convinced
we
were
being
observed
by
space
visitors
searched
all
the
old
reports
some
sighting
over
germany
set
them
off
about
that
what
i
was
told
i
think
that
where
they
first
got
the
idea
of
trying
out
oval
and
circular
airfoils
up
to
then
nobody
was
interested
the
rotation
idea
uses
the
same
principle
as
the
helicopter
but
nobody
had
even
followed
that
through
the
nazis
went
to
work
on
the
disks
they
also
began
to
rush
plans
the
orbiting
satellite
idea
i
think
they
realized
these
space
ships
were
using
some
great
source
of
power
we
had
discovered
on
earth
i
believe
that
what
they
were
after
that
power
secret
if
they
succeeded
they
have
owned
the
world
as
it
was
that
space
project
caused
them
to
leap
ahead
of
everybody
with
rockets
when
i
asked
redell
how
he
thought
the
space
ships
were
powered
he
shrugged
probably
cosmic
rays
hold
the
answer
their
power
would
be
even
greater
than
atomic
power
there
another
source
i
heard
mentioned
but
most
people
scoff
at
it
that
the
use
of
electromagnetic
fields
in
space
the
earth
has
its
magnetic
field
of
course
and
so
does
the
sun
probably
all
planets
do
there
a
man
named
fernand
roussel
who
wrote
a
book
called
the
unifying
principle
of
physical
phenomena
about
he
goes
into
the
theory
if
he
right
then
there
must
be
some
way
to
tap
this
force
and
go
from
one
planet
to
another
without
using
any
fuel
you
use
your
first
planet
magnetic
field
to
start
you
off
and
then
coast
through
space
until
you
got
into
the
field
of
the
next
planet
at
least
that
how
i
understand
it
but
you
be
safer
sticking
to
atomic
power
that
been
proved
most
of
our
conversations
had
been
keyed
to
the
technical
side
of
the
problem
but
before
i
left
this
time
i
asked
redell
how
the
thought
of
space
visitors
affected
him
oh
at
first
i
had
a
queer
feeling
about
it
he
answered
but
once
you
accept
it
it
like
anything
else
you
get
used
to
the
idea
one
thing
bothers
me
i
said
when
i
try
to
picture
them
i
keep
remembering
the
things
in
some
of
the
comics
what
do
you
suppose
they
really
like
i
thought
about
it
for
months
redell
slowly
shook
his
head
i
have
the
slightest
idea
chapter
xiv
that
evening
after
my
talk
with
redell
the
question
kept
coming
back
in
my
mind
what
were
they
like
and
what
were
they
doing
here
from
the
long
record
of
sightings
it
was
possible
to
get
an
answer
to
the
second
question
observation
of
the
earth
followed
a
general
pattern
according
to
the
reports
europe
the
most
populated
area
had
been
more
closely
observed
than
the
rest
of
the
globe
until
about
by
this
time
the
united
states
beginning
to
rival
europe
in
industrial
progress
had
evidently
become
of
interest
to
the
crews
from
then
on
europe
and
the
western
hemisphere
chiefly
north
america
shared
the
observers
attention
the
few
sightings
reported
at
other
points
around
the
world
indicate
an
occasional
on
the
earth
in
general
apparently
world
war
i
had
not
greatly
concerned
the
space
observers
one
reason
might
be
that
our
aerial
operations
were
still
at
a
relatively
low
altitude
but
world
war
ii
had
drawn
more
attention
and
this
had
obviously
increased
from
up
to
the
present
time
our
explosions
and
the
experiments
might
be
only
coincidence
but
i
could
think
of
no
other
development
that
might
seriously
concern
dwellers
on
other
planets
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
think
of
some
race
keeping
track
of
the
earth
progress
if
redell
was
right
it
might
even
have
started
in
prehistoric
time
a
brief
survey
perhaps
once
a
century
or
even
further
spaced
then
gradually
more
frequent
observation
as
cities
appeared
on
the
earth
somewhere
on
a
distant
planet
there
would
be
records
of
that
long
survey
i
wondered
how
our
development
would
appear
to
that
race
they
would
have
seen
the
slow
sailing
ships
the
first
steamships
the
lines
of
steel
tracks
that
carried
our
first
trains
watching
for
our
first
aircraft
they
would
see
the
drifting
balloons
that
seemed
an
aerial
miracle
when
the
montgolfiers
first
succeeded
more
than
a
century
later
they
would
have
noted
the
slow
clumsy
airplanes
of
the
early
from
our
gradual
progress
to
the
big
planes
and
bombers
of
today
they
could
probably
chart
our
next
steps
toward
the
stratosphere
and
then
space
during
the
last
two
centuries
they
would
have
watched
a
dozen
wars
each
one
fiercer
than
the
last
spreading
over
the
globe
adding
up
all
the
things
they
had
seen
they
could
draw
an
accurate
picture
of
man
the
earth
creature
and
the
increasingly
fierce
struggle
between
the
earth
races
the
long
survey
held
no
sign
of
menace
if
there
had
been
a
guiding
purpose
of
attack
and
destruction
it
could
have
been
carried
out
years
ago
it
was
almost
certain
that
any
planet
race
able
to
traverse
space
would
have
the
means
for
attack
more
than
once
during
this
investigation
i
had
been
asked
if
the
saucers
are
interplanetary
why
have
they
landed
here
why
their
crews
tried
to
make
contact
with
us
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
the
planet
race
or
races
could
not
survive
on
earth
or
that
their
communications
did
not
include
the
methods
that
we
used
but
i
found
that
hard
to
believe
such
a
superior
race
would
certainly
be
able
to
master
our
radio
operations
or
anything
else
that
we
had
developed
in
a
fairly
short
time
and
it
should
be
equally
simple
to
devise
some
means
of
survival
on
earth
just
as
we
were
already
planning
special
suits
and
helmets
for
existence
on
the
moon
during
a
talk
with
a
former
intelligence
officer
i
got
a
key
to
the
probable
explanation
why
do
you
just
reverse
it
list
what
we
intend
to
do
when
we
start
exploring
space
that
give
you
the
approximate
picture
of
what
visitors
to
the
earth
would
be
doing
naturally
all
the
details
of
space
plans
have
not
been
worked
out
but
the
general
plan
is
clear
after
the
first
successful
earth
satellites
we
will
either
attempt
a
space
base
farther
out
or
else
launch
a
moon
rocket
probably
many
round
trips
to
the
moon
will
be
made
before
going
farther
in
space
which
planet
will
be
explored
first
after
the
moon
according
to
air
force
reports
it
is
almost
a
certainty
that
planets
outside
the
solar
system
are
inhabited
but
because
of
the
vast
distances
involved
expeditions
to
our
neighboring
planets
may
be
tried
before
the
more
formidable
journeys
more
than
one
prominent
astronomer
believes
that
life
entirely
different
from
our
own
may
exist
on
some
solar
planets
besides
mars
jupiter
and
venus
there
are
five
more
that
like
the
earth
revolve
around
the
sun
one
of
the
prominent
authorities
is
spencer
jones
astronomer
royal
in
his
book
life
on
other
worlds
jones
points
out
that
everything
about
us
is
the
result
of
changing
processes
begun
millenniums
ago
and
still
going
on
we
can
not
define
life
solely
in
our
own
terms
it
can
exist
in
unfamiliar
forms
it
is
conceivable
jones
states
in
his
book
that
we
could
have
beings
the
cells
of
whose
bodies
contained
silicon
instead
of
the
carbon
which
is
an
essential
constituent
of
our
cells
and
of
all
other
living
cells
on
the
earth
and
that
because
of
this
essential
difference
between
the
constitution
of
those
cells
and
the
cells
of
which
animal
and
plant
life
on
the
earth
are
built
up
they
might
be
able
to
exist
at
temperatures
so
high
that
no
terrestrial
types
of
life
could
survive
according
to
jones
then
life
could
be
possible
on
worlds
hotter
and
drier
than
ours
it
could
also
exist
on
a
very
much
colder
one
such
as
mars
even
if
a
survey
of
the
sun
planets
proved
fruitless
it
would
decide
the
question
of
their
being
populated
also
it
would
provide
valuable
experience
for
the
much
longer
journeys
into
space
no
one
expects
such
a
survey
until
we
have
a
space
vehicle
able
to
make
the
round
trip
trips
would
tell
us
nothing
even
if
volunteers
offered
to
make
such
suicidal
journeys
the
most
probable
step
will
be
to
launch
a
space
vehicle
equipped
with
supplies
for
a
long
time
perhaps
a
year
or
two
within
the
solar
system
since
mars
has
been
frequently
mentioned
as
a
source
of
the
flying
saucers
let
assume
it
would
be
the
first
planet
to
be
explored
from
the
earth
as
the
space
ship
neared
mars
it
could
be
turned
to
circle
the
planet
in
an
orbit
just
like
our
planned
earth
satellite
vehicle
once
in
this
orbit
it
could
circle
indefinitely
without
using
fuel
except
to
correct
its
course
from
this
space
base
unmanned
observer
units
with
television
eyes
or
other
transmitters
would
be
sent
down
to
survey
the
planet
at
close
range
if
it
then
seemed
fairly
safe
a
manned
unit
could
be
released
to
make
a
more
thorough
such
preliminary
caution
would
be
imperative
our
explorers
would
have
no
idea
of
what
awaited
them
the
planet
might
be
uninhabited
it
might
be
peopled
by
a
fiercely
barbarous
race
unaware
of
civilization
as
we
know
it
or
it
might
have
a
civilization
far
in
advance
of
ours
the
explorers
would
first
try
to
get
a
general
idea
of
the
whole
planet
then
they
would
attempt
to
examine
the
most
densely
populated
areas
types
of
armature
any
aircraft
likely
to
attack
them
combing
the
radio
spectrum
they
would
pick
up
and
record
sounds
and
signals
in
order
to
decipher
the
language
as
on
earth
they
might
hear
a
hodgepodge
of
tongues
the
next
step
would
be
to
select
the
most
technically
advanced
nation
listen
in
and
try
to
learn
its
language
or
record
it
for
deciphering
afterward
on
earth
our
astronomers
already
have
analyzed
mars
atmosphere
but
the
explorers
would
have
to
confirm
their
reports
to
find
out
whether
the
atmosphere
at
the
surface
would
support
their
lungs
if
they
landed
the
easiest
way
would
be
to
send
down
manned
or
unmanned
units
with
special
apparatus
to
scoop
in
atmosphere
samples
later
analysis
would
tell
whether
earthlings
would
need
suits
such
as
we
plan
to
use
on
the
moon
but
before
risking
flight
at
such
low
altitudes
the
explorers
would
first
learn
everything
possible
about
the
planet
aircraft
if
any
they
would
try
to
determine
their
top
ceiling
maximum
speed
maneuverability
and
if
possible
their
weapons
mitch
of
this
could
be
done
by
sending
down
observer
disks
or
whatever
type
we
decide
to
use
a
manned
unit
might
make
a
survey
at
night
or
in
daytime
with
clouds
nearby
to
shield
it
by
hovering
over
the
planet
aircraft
bases
the
explorers
could
get
most
of
the
picture
and
also
decide
whether
the
bases
were
suitable
for
their
own
use
later
it
might
even
be
necessary
to
lure
some
martian
aircraft
into
pursuit
of
our
units
to
find
out
their
performance
but
our
explorers
would
above
all
avoid
any
sign
of
hostility
they
would
hastily
withdraw
to
show
they
had
no
warlike
intentions
if
the
appearance
of
our
observer
units
and
manned
craft
caused
too
violent
reactions
on
the
planet
the
explorers
would
withdraw
to
their
orbiting
space
vehicle
and
either
wait
for
a
lull
or
else
start
the
long
trip
back
home
another
interplanetary
craft
from
the
earth
might
take
its
place
later
to
resume
periodic
surveys
in
this
way
a
vast
amount
of
information
could
be
collected
without
once
making
contact
with
the
strange
race
if
they
seemed
belligerent
or
uncivilized
we
would
probably
end
our
survey
and
check
on
the
next
possibly
inhabited
planet
if
we
found
they
were
highly
civilized
we
would
undoubtedly
attempt
later
contact
but
it
might
take
a
long
time
decades
of
observation
and
analysis
before
we
were
ready
for
that
final
step
we
might
find
a
civilization
not
quite
so
advanced
as
ours
it
might
not
yet
have
developed
radio
and
television
we
would
then
have
no
way
of
getting
a
detailed
picture
learning
the
languages
or
communicating
with
the
martians
analysis
of
their
atmosphere
might
show
a
great
hazard
to
earthlings
one
making
it
impossible
to
land
or
requiring
years
of
research
to
overcome
there
might
be
other
obstacles
beyond
our
present
understanding
this
same
procedure
would
apply
to
the
rest
of
the
planets
and
to
more
distant
systems
since
wolf
is
the
nearest
star
outside
our
system
that
is
likely
to
have
inhabited
planets
one
of
these
planets
would
probably
be
listed
as
the
first
to
explore
in
space
it
would
be
a
tremendous
undertaking
unless
the
speed
of
light
can
be
exceeded
in
space
since
wolf
is
eight
from
the
earth
even
if
a
space
ship
traveled
at
the
theoretical
maximum
just
under
miles
a
second
it
would
take
over
sixteen
years
for
the
round
trip
detailed
observation
of
the
planet
would
add
to
this
period
if
we
assume
half
that
speed
which
would
still
be
an
incredible
attainment
with
our
present
knowledge
our
space
explorers
would
have
to
dedicate
at
least
years
to
the
hazardous
lonely
round
trip
however
there
has
never
been
a
lack
of
volunteers
for
grand
undertakings
in
the
history
of
man
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
our
survey
of
the
planets
we
would
find
some
inhabited
but
not
advanced
enough
to
be
of
interest
to
us
periodically
we
might
make
return
visits
to
note
their
progress
meantime
our
astronomers
would
watch
these
planets
probably
developing
new
higher
powered
telescopes
for
the
purpose
to
detect
any
signs
of
unusual
activity
any
tremendous
explosion
on
a
planet
would
immediately
concern
us
such
an
explosion
on
mars
was
reported
by
astronomers
on
january
the
cause
and
general
effects
are
still
being
debated
sadao
saeki
the
japanese
astronomer
who
first
reported
it
at
osaka
believes
it
was
of
volcanic
nature
the
explosion
created
a
cloud
over
an
area
about
seven
hundred
miles
in
diameter
and
forty
miles
high
it
was
dull
gray
with
a
yellowish
tinge
and
a
different
color
from
the
atmospheric
phenomena
customarily
seen
near
mars
saeki
believes
the
blast
might
have
destroyed
any
form
of
life
existing
on
the
planet
but
even
though
the
telescopic
camera
recorded
a
violent
explosion
other
authorities
do
not
believe
the
planet
was
wrecked
the
canals
first
discovered
on
mars
by
giovanni
schiaparelli
about
are
still
apparent
on
photographs
mars
is
now
being
carefully
watched
by
astronomers
if
there
are
more
of
the
strange
explosions
the
planet
will
be
scanned
constantly
for
some
clue
to
their
nature
if
a
mysterious
explosion
on
mars
or
any
other
planet
were
found
of
atomic
origin
it
would
cause
serious
concern
on
earth
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
happened
many
years
from
now
when
we
will
have
succeeded
in
space
explorations
at
this
time
let
us
assume
our
explorers
have
found
that
mars
is
experimenting
with
rockets
some
of
them
have
been
seen
rising
at
tremendous
speed
in
the
upper
atmosphere
of
mars
then
comes
this
violent
explosion
a
scientific
analysis
of
the
cloud
by
astrophysicists
here
on
earth
proves
it
was
of
atomic
origin
the
first
reaction
would
undoubtedly
be
an
immediate
resurvey
of
mars
as
quickly
as
possible
we
would
establish
an
orbiting
space
base
out
of
range
of
martian
rockets
and
try
to
find
how
far
they
had
advanced
with
atomic
bombs
samples
of
the
martian
atmosphere
would
be
collected
and
analyzed
for
telltale
radiation
observer
units
would
be
flown
over
the
planet
with
instruments
to
locate
plants
and
possibly
uranium
deposits
the
bases
would
also
come
under
close
observation
we
would
try
to
learn
how
close
the
scientists
were
to
escaping
the
pull
of
gravity
since
mars
gravity
is
much
less
than
the
earth
the
martians
would
not
have
so
far
to
progress
before
succeeding
in
space
travel
the
detailed
survey
by
our
observers
would
probably
show
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
to
the
earth
it
might
take
one
hundred
years
perhaps
five
hundred
before
the
martians
could
be
a
problem
eventually
the
time
would
come
when
mars
would
send
out
explorers
they
would
undoubtedly
discover
that
the
earth
was
populated
with
a
technically
advanced
civilization
any
warlike
ideas
they
had
in
mind
could
be
quickly
ended
by
a
show
of
our
superior
space
craft
and
our
own
atomic
weapons
probably
far
superior
to
any
on
mars
it
might
even
be
possible
that
by
then
we
would
have
finally
outlawed
war
if
so
a
promise
to
share
the
peaceful
benefits
of
our
technical
knowledge
might
be
enough
to
bring
martian
leaders
into
line
regardless
of
our
final
decision
we
would
certainly
keep
a
lose
watch
on
mars
or
any
other
planet
that
seemed
a
possible
threat
now
if
our
program
is
just
reversed
it
will
give
a
reasonable
picture
of
how
visitors
from
space
might
go
about
investigating
the
earth
such
an
investigation
would
tie
in
with
the
general
pattern
of
authentic
reports
sightings
at
long
intervals
up
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
concentration
on
europe
as
the
most
advanced
section
of
the
globe
until
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
frequent
surveys
of
america
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
we
began
to
develop
industrially
with
cities
springing
up
across
the
land
periodic
surveys
of
both
america
and
europe
during
the
gradual
development
of
aircraft
from
the
early
up
to
world
war
ii
an
increase
of

during
world

increasing

eniwetok
a
second
spurt
of
observations
following
explosions
in
soviet
russia
continuing
observations
of
the
earth
at
regular
intervals
with
most
attention
concentrated
on
the
united
states
the
present

in
atomic

saucers
have
been
reported
seen
over
the
soviet
union
but
the
number
is
unknown
there
is
some
evidence
that
russia
has
an
investigative
unit
similar
to
project
saucer
there
are
other
points
of
similarity
to
the
program
of
american
space
exploration
that
i
have
outlined
most
of
the
extremely
large

been
at
high
altitudes
some
of
them
many
miles
above
the
earth
at
that
height
a
space
ship
would
be
in
no
danger
from
our
planes
and
antiaircraft
guns
and
rockets
the
smaller
disks
and
the
mystery
lights
have
been
seen
at
low
altitudes
occasionally
a
larger
saucer
has
been
seen
to
approach
the
earth
briefly
as
at
lockbourne
air
force
base
at
bethel
alabama
at
macon
and
montgomery
and
other
places
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
securing
atmospheric
samples
it
could
also
be
to
afford
personal
observation
by
the
crews
the
numerous
small
disks
seen
in
the
first
part
of
the
scare
in
fit
the
pattern
for
preliminary
and
close
observation
by
observer
units
as
the
scare
increased
the
daytime
sightings
decreased
for
a
while
and
mystery
lights
began
to
be
seen
more
often
this
apparent
desire
to
avoid
unfavorable
attention
could
have
been
caused
by
our
pilots
repeated
attempts
to
chase
the
strange
flying
objects
authentic
reports
have
described
sightings
over
the
following
air
force
bases
chanute
newark
andrews
hickam
robbins
godman
clark
fairfield
suisan
harmon
holloman
clinton
county
air
force
base
and
air
bases
in
alaska
germany
and
the
azores
saucers
have
also
been
sighted
over
naval
air
stations
at
dallas
alameda
and
key
west
and
from
the
station
at
seattle
they
have
been
reported
maneuvering
over
the
white
sands
proving
ground
over
areas
containing
atomic
developments
above
the
muroc
air
base
testing
area
and
over
the
research
base
near
albuquerque
several
times
saucers
have
paced
both
military
and
civil
aircraft
their
actions
strongly
indicate
deliberate
encounters
to
learn
our
planes
speed
and
performance
it
seems
obvious
that
both
the
planes
and
the
bases
were
being
observed
and
in
some
cases
photographed
by
units
or
manned
space
ships
although
i
thought
it
improbable
that
the
location
of
our
uranium
deposits
would
be
of
interest
to
space
men
a
washington
official
told
me
it
would
be
relatively
simple
to
detect
the
ore
areas
with
airborne
instruments
the
geological
survey
has
already
developed
special
geiger
counters
for
planes
he
told
me
they
had
a
little
trouble
from
noise
they
finally
had
to
cover
the
geigers
with
lead
shields
whenever
an
important
amount
of
radiation
is
present
in
the
ground
the
plane
crew
gets
a
signal
and
they
spot
the
place
on
their
map
it
a
quick
way
of
locating
valuable
deposits
when
i
told
him
what
i
had
in
mind
he
suggested
an
angle
i
had
not
considered
mind
you
he
said
i
not
completely
sold
on
the
interplanetary
answer
but
assuming
it
correct
that
we
being
observed
i
can
think
of
a
stronger
reason
than
fear
of
some
distant
attack
some
atomic
scientists
say
that
a
bomb
or
several
set
off
at
once
could
knock
the
earth
out
of
its
orbit
it
sounds
fantastic
but
so
is
the
it
just
possible
that
some
race
discovered
the
dangers
long
ago
they
would
have
good
reason
to
worry
if
they
found
we
were
on
that
same
track
there
may
be
some
other
atomic
weapon
we
do
suspect
even
worse
than
the
one
that
could
destroy
the
earth
and
seriously
affect
other
planets
at
the
time
i
thought
this
was
just
idle
speculation
but
since
then
several
atomic
scientists
have
confirmed
this
official
suggestion
one
of
these
was
paul
elliott
a
nuclear
physicist
who
worked
on
the
during
the
war
according
to
elliott
if
several
hydrogen
bombs
were
exploded
simultaneously
at
a
high
altitude
it
could
speed
up
the
rotation
or
change
its
orbit
he
based
his
statement
on
the
rate
of
energy
the
earth
receives
from
the
sun
a
rate
equal
to
some
four
pounds
of
hydrogen
exploded
every
second
still
other
atomic
scientists
have
said
that
explosions
might
even
knock
a
large
chunk
out
of
the
earth
with
unpredictable
results
a
dramatic
picture
of
what
might
happen
if
the
earth
were
forced
far
out
of
its
orbit
is
indicated
in
the
book
worlds
in
collision
by
immanuel
velikovsky
recently
published
by
macmillan
after
many
years
of
research
velikovsky
presents
strong
evidence
that
the
planet
venus
when
still
a
comet
resulting
from
eruption
from
a
larger
planet
moved
erratically
about
the
sky
and
violently
disturbed
both
the
earth
and
mars
when
the
comet
approached
the
earth
our
planet
was
forced
out
of
its
orbit
according
to
worlds
in
collision
for
a
time
the
world
was
on
the
brink
of
destruction
quoting
many
authentic
ancient
records
including
the
quiché
manuscript
of
the
mayas
the
ipuwer
papyrus
of
the
egyptians
and
the
of
the
buddhists
velikovsky
describes
the
cataclysm
that
took
place
the
face
of
the
earth
changed
he
writes
in
his
book
the
details
reinforced
by
the
of
the
persians
tell
of
tremendous
hurricanes
of
a
major
upheaval
in
the
earth
surface
of
oceans
rushing
over
many
parts
of
the
land
while
rivers
were
driven
from
their
beds
some
of
the
events
in
this
period
are
mentioned
in
the
bible
professor
horace
kallen
former
dean
of
the
new
school
of
social
research
strongly
endorses
velikovsky
statements
it
is
my
belief
that
velikovsky
has
supported
his
theses
with
substantial
evidence
and
made
an
effective
and
persuasive
argument
many
other
authorities
endorse
this
work
which
is
documented
with
impressive
references
but
even
if
this
particular
account
is
not
accepted
all
astronomers
agree
that
the
effect
of
a
comet
passing
near
the
earth
would
be
appalling
worlds
in
collision
states
that
mars
like
the
earth
was
pulled
out
of
its
orbit
by
the
erratic
passage
it
may
be
that
this
near
disaster
to
the
earth
and
mars
is
known
on
other
solar
planets
or
remembered
on
mars
itself
if
the
planet
is
inhabited
the
possibility
of
explosions
on
the
earth
understandably
disturb
any
dwellers
on
other
planets
this
may
be
what
was
back
of
the
project
saucer
statement
on
the
probable
motives
of
any
visitors
from
space
i
mentioned
this
air
force
statement
in
an
earlier
chapter
but
it
may
be
of
interest
to
repeat
it
at
this
time
the
comment
appeared
in
a
confidential
analysis
of
intelligence
reports
in
the
formerly
secret
project
saucer
document
report
on
unidentified
aerial
and
celestial
objects
it
reads
as
follows
such
a
civilization
might
observe
that
on
earth
we
now
have
atomic
bombs
and
are
fast
developing
rockets
in
view
of
the
past
history
of
mankind
they
should
be
alarmed
we
should
therefore
expect
at
this
time
above
all
to
behold
such
visitations
since
the
acts
of
mankind
most
easily
observed
from
a
distance
are
explosions
we
should
expect
some
relation
to
obtain
between
the
time
of
the
explosions
the
time
at
which
the
space
ships
are
seen
and
the
time
required
for
such
ships
to
arrive
from
and
return
to
home
base
chapter
xv
it
was
early
in
october
when
i
finished
the
reversal
of
our
plans
i
spent
the
next
two
days
running
down
a
sighting
report
from
a
town
in
pennsylvania
like
three
or
four
other
tips
that
had
seemed
important
at
first
it
turned
out
to
be
a
dud
when
i
got
back
home
i
found
ken
purdy
had
been
trying
to
reach
me
i
phoned
him
at
true
and
he
asked
me
to
fly
up
to
new
york
the
next
day
i
just
heard
there
another
magazine
working
on
the
saucer
story
he
told
me
who
is
it
i
said
i
do
know
yet
it
may
be
just
a
rumor
but
we
ca
take
a
chance
we
got
to
get
this
in
the
january
book
that
night
i
gathered
up
all
the
material
it
looked
hopeless
to
condense
it
into
one
article
and
i
knew
that
purdy
had
even
more
investigators
reports
waiting
for
me
in
new
york
flying
up
the
next
morning
i
suddenly
thought
of
a
talk
i
had
with
an
air
transport
official
it
was
in
washington
i
had
just
told
him
about
the
investigation
if
they
are
spacemen
he
said
they
probably
have
a
hard
time
figuring
out
this
country
by
listening
to
our
broadcasts
imagine
tuning
in
soap
operas
lone
ranger
and
a
couple
of
crime
yarns
along
with
newscasts
about
strikes
and
murders
and
the
cold
war
they
might
pick
up
some
of
those
kid
programs
about
rocket
ships
a
few
days
of
listening
to
that
stuff
well
it
would
give
them
one
hell
of
a
picture
except
for
some
hoax
reports
this
was
the
first
funny
suggestion
had
about
the
spacemen
but
now
thinking
seriously
about
it
i
realized
he
had
an
important
point
it
was
possible
that
men
from
another
planet
might
have
to
reorient
even
their
way
of
thinking
to
understand
the
earth
ways
it
would
not
be
automatic
despite
their
superior
technical
progress
evolution
might
have
produced
basic
differences
in
their
understanding
of
life
humor
for
instance
might
be
totally
lacking
in
their
what
would
they
be
like
i
tried
to
imagine
how
they
might
look
without
getting
anywhere
spencer
jones
had
helped
much
with
his
life
on
other
worlds
i
could
begin
to
visualize
beings
with
totally
different
cells
perhaps
able
to
take
terrific
heat
or
bitter
cold
as
merely
normal
weather
there
were
all
kinds
of
possibilities
if
they
lived
on
mars
for
instance
perhaps
they
could
take
the
heavier
gravity
of
the
earth
they
might
be
easily
subject
to
our
diseases
especially
if
they
had
destroyed
disease
germs
on
their
planet
a
natural
step
for
an
advanced
race
it
was
possible
i
knew
that
the
spacemen
might
look
grotesque
to
us
but
i
clung
to
a
stubborn
feeling
that
they
would
resemble
man
that
came
of
course
from
an
inborn
feeling
of
man
superiority
over
all
living
things
it
carried
over
into
a
feeling
that
any
thinking
intelligent
being
whether
on
mars
or
wolf
planets
should
have
evolved
in
the
same
form
i
gave
up
trying
to
imagine
how
the
spacemen
might
look
there
was
simply
nothing
to
go
on
but
there
were
strong
indications
of
how
they
thought
and
reacted
certain
qualities
were
plainly
evident
intelligence
no
one
could
dispute
that
it
took
a
high
order
of
mentality
to
construct
and
operate
a
space
ship
courage
it
would
take
brave
men
to
face
the
hazards
of
space
curiosity
without
this
quality
they
would
never
have
thought
to
explore
planets
there
were
other
qualities
that
seemed
almost
equally
certain
these
spacemen
apparently
lacked
belligerence
there
had
been
no
sign
of
hostility
through
all
the
years
they
were
seemingly
painstaking
and
extremely
methodical
it
was
still
not
much
of
a
picture
but
somehow
it
was
encouraging
glancing
down
from
the
plane
window
i
thought
how
does
this
look
to
them
our
farms
our
cities
the
railroads
there
below
the
highways
with
the
speeding
cars
and
trucks
the
winding
river
and
far
off
to
the
right
the
broad
stretch
of
the
atlantic
what
would
they
think
of
america
manhattan
came
into
sight
as
the
pilot
let
down
for
the
landing
an
odd
thought
popped
into
my
mind
how
would
a
spaceman
react
if
he
saw
a
broadway
show
not
long
before
i
had
seen
south
pacific
i
could
still
hear
ezio
pinza
magnificent
voice
as
he
sang
some
enchanted
evening
was
music
a
part
of
spacemen
lives
or
would
it
be
something
new
and
strange
perhaps
completely
distasteful
they
might
live
and
think
on
a
coldly
intelligent
level
without
a
touch
of
what
we
know
as
emotion
to
them
our
lives
might
seem
meaningless
and
dull
we
ourselves
might
appear
grotesque
in
form
but
in
their
progress
there
must
have
been
struggle
trial
and
error
some
feeling
of
triumph
at
success
surely
these
would
be
emotional
forces
bound
to
reflect
in
the
planet
races
perhaps
in
spite
of
some
differences
we
would
find
a
common
bond
the
bond
of
thinking
intelligent
creatures
trying
to
better
themselves
the
airliner
landed
and
taxied
in
to
unload
as
i
went
down
the
gangway
i
suddenly
realized
something
my
last
vague
fear
was
gone
it
had
not
been
a
personal
fear
of
the
visitors
from
space
it
had
been
a
selfish
fear
of
the
impact
on
my
life
i
realized
that
now
it
might
be
a
long
time
before
they
would
try
to
make
contact
but
i
had
a
conviction
that
when
it
came
it
would
be
a
peaceful
mission
not
an
ultimatum
it
could
even
be
the
means
of
ending
wars
on
earth
but
i
had
been
conditioned
to
this
thing
i
had
had
six
months
of
preparation
six
months
to
go
from
complete
skepticism
to
slow
final
acceptance
what
if
it
had
been
thrown
at
me
in
black
headlines
even
a
peaceful
contact
by
beings
from
another
planet
would
profoundly
affect
the
world
the
story
in
true
might
play
an
important
part
in
that
final
effect
carefully
done
it
could
help
prepare
americans
for
the
official
disclosure
but
if
it
were
done
right
we
might
be
opening
a
pandora
box
chapter
xvi
that
morning
at
true
we
made
the
final
decisions
on
how
to
handle
the
story
using
the
evidence
of
the
mantell
case
the
report
gorman
encounter
and
other
authentic
cases
along
with
the
records
of
early
sightings
we
would
state
our
main
conclusion
that
the
flying
saucers
were
interplanetary
in
going
over
the
mass
of
reports
purdy
and
i
both
realized
that
a
few
sightings
did
not
fit
the
pattern
most
of
these
reports
came
from
the
southwest
states
where
experiments
were
going
on
purdy
agreed
with
paul
redell
that
any
tests
would
be
made
over
the
sea
or
unpopulated
areas
with
every
attempt
at
secrecy
they
might
make
tests
down
there
in
new
mexico
and
over
texas
he
said
but
they
never
risk
killing
people
by
shooting
the
things
all
over
the
country
they
already
set
up
a
range
for
the
longer
runs
i
added
it
runs
from
florida
into
the
south
atlantic
and
the
navy
missiles
at
point
mugu
are
launched
out
over
the
pacific
any
guided
missiles
coming
down
over
settled
areas
would
certainly
be
an
accident
besides
all
that
no
missile
on
earth
can
explain
these
major
cases
purdy
was
emphatic
about
speculating
on
our
research
suppose
you
analyzed
these
minor
cases
that
look
like
missile
tests
you
might
accidentally
give
away
something
important
like
their
range
and
speeds
look
what
the
russians
did
with
the
hints
washington
let
out
it
was
finally
decided
that
we
would
briefly
mention
the
guided
missiles
along
with
the
fact
that
the
armed
services
had
flatly
denied
any
link
with
the
saucers
after
all
interplanetary
travel
is
the
main
story
said
purdy
and
the
mantell
case
alone
proves
been
observed
from
space
ships
even
without
the
old
records
the
question
of
the
story
impact
worried
both
of
us
public
acceptance
of
intelligent
life
on
other
planets
would
affect
almost
every
phase
of
our
defense
planning
philosophy
even
religion
of
course
the
immediate
effect
was
more
important
personally
i
thought
that
most
americans
could
take
even
an
official
announcement
without
too
much
trouble
but
i
could
be
wrong
the
only
yardstick
and
that
not
much
good
is
that
story
said
purdy
a
lot
of
people
have
got
excited
about
it
but
they
seem
more
interested
than
scared
the
story
of
the
little
men
from
venus
had
been
circulating
for
some
time
in
the
usual
version
two
flying
saucers
had
come
down
near
our
southwest
border
in
the
space
craft
were
several
oddly
dressed
men
three
feet
high
all
of
them
were
dead
the
cause
was
usually
given
as
inability
to
stand
our
atmosphere
the
air
force
was
said
to
have
hushed
up
the
story
so
that
the
public
could
be
educated
gradually
to
the
truth
though
it
had
all
the
earmarks
of
a
hoax
many
newspapers
had
repeated
the
story
it
had
even
been
broadcast
as
fact
on
several
radio
newscasts
but
there
had
been
no
signs
of
public
alarm
it
looks
as
if
people
have
come
a
long
way
since
that
orson
welles
scare
i
said
to
purdy
but
there
is
any
menace
in
this
story
he
objected
the
crews
were
reported
dead
so
everybody
got
the
idea
that
spacemen
live
if
they
landed
what
if
a
space
ship
should
suddenly
come
down
over
a
big
city
say
new
york
low
enough
for
millions
of
people
to
see
it
it
might
cause
a
stampede
i
said
purdy
snorted
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
it
did
unless
people
had
been
fully
prepared
if
we
do
a
straight
fact
piece
just
giving
the
evidence
it
will
start
the
ball
rolling
people
at
least
will
be
thinking
about
it
before
i
left
for
washington
i
told
purdy
of
my
last
visit
to
the
pentagon
i
had
informed
air
force
press
relations
officials
of
true
intention
to
publish
the
answer
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
dissuade
me
and
i
had
been
told
once
again
that
there
was
no
security
involved
that
project
saucer
had
found
nothing
threatening
the
safety
of
america
at
this
time
i
had
also
asked
if
project
saucer
files
were
now
available
the
wright
field
unit
i
was
told
still
was
a
classified
project
both
its
files
and
its
photographs
secret
this
had
been
the
first
week
in
october
when
i
asked
if
there
was
any
other
information
on
published
cases
the
answer
again
was
negative
the
april
report
according
to
press
branch
officials
was
still
an
accurate
statement
of
air
force
opinions
and
policies
so
far
as
they
knew
no
other
explanations
had
be
n
found
for
the
unidentified
saucers
in
absolutely
convinced
now
i
told
purdy
that
here
an
official
policy
to
let
the
thing
leak
out
it
explains
why
forrestal
announced
our
earth
satellite
vehicle
program
years
before
we
could
even
start
to
build
it
it
also
would
explain
those
project
hints
in
the
april
report
i
think
we
being
used
as
a
trial
balloon
purdy
said
thoughtfully
we
let
them
know
what
we
doing
if
they
wanted
to
stop
us
the
air
force
could
easily
have
done
it
all
they
have
to
do
would
be
call
us
in
give
us
the
dope
off
the
record
and
tell
us
it
was
a
patriotic
duty
to
keep
still
just
the
way
they
did
about
uranium
and
atomic
experiments
during
the
war
he
still
did
not
have
the
name
of
the
other
magazine
supposed
to
be
working
on
the
saucers
but
it
seemed
a
reliable
tip
it
later
proved
to
be
true
and
from
then
on
we
worked
under
high
pressure
in
writing
the
article
i
used
only
the
most
authentic
recent
sightings
all
of
the
cases
were
in
the
air
force
reports
when
it
came
to
the
mantell
case
i
stuck
to
published
estimates
of
the
strange
object
size
a
mysterious
ship
to
feet
in
diameter
was
startling
enough
at
first
i
chose
mars
to
illustrate
our
space
explorations
but
mars
had
been
associated
with
the
orson
welles
stampede
most
discussions
of
the
planet
had
a
menacing
note
perhaps
because
of
its
warlike
name
in
the
end
i
switched
to
a
planet
of
wolf
the
thought
of
those
eight
would
have
a
comforting
effect
on
any
nervous
readers
the
chance
of
any
mass
visitation
would
seem
remote
if
not
impossible
but
it
would
still
put
across
the
story
as
finally
revised
the
article
written
under
my
byline
stated
the
following
points
as
the
conclusions
reached
by
true
for
the
past
years
the
earth
has
been
under
systematic
examination
by
living
intelligent
observers
from
another
planet
the
intensity
of
this
observation
and
the
frequency
of
the
visits
to
the
earth
atmosphere
have
increased
markedly
during
the
past
two
years
the
vehicles
used
for
this
observation
and
for
interplanetary
transport
by
the
explorers
have
been
classed
as
follows
type
i
a
small
craft
equipped
with
some
form
of
television
or
impulse
transmitter
type
ii
a
very
large
metallic
aircraft
operating
on
the
helicopter
principle
type
iii
a
wingless
aircraft
that
in
the
earth
atmosphere
operates
in
conformance
with
the
prandtl
theory
of
lift
the
discernible
patterns
of
observation
and
exploration
shown
by
the
flying
disks
varies
in
no
important
particular
from
american
plans
for
the
exploration
of
space
expected
to
come
to
fruition
within
the
next
fifty
years
there
is
reason
to
believe
however
that
some
other
race
of
thinking
beings
is
a
matter
of
two
and
a
quarter
centuries
ahead
of
us
following
these
points
i
added
a
brief
comment
on
the
possibility
of
guided
missiles
adding
that
the
air
force
had
convincingly
denied
this
as
an
explanation
of
any
sightings
as
purdy
had
suggested
i
carefully
omitted
ten
minor
cases
that
i
thought
might
be
linked
with
research
if
disclosing
the
facts
about
space
travel
helped
to
divert
attention
from
any
secret
tests
so
much
the
better
true
accepts
the
official
denial
of
any
secret
device
i
stated
because
the
weight
of
the
evidence
especially
the
sightings
does
not
support
such
a
belief
most
readers
of
course
would
know
that
some
experiments
were
going
on
and
that
true
was
fully
aware
of
it
but
our
main
purpose
would
be
achieved
the
fact
that
the
earth
had
been
observed
by
beings
from
another
planet
would
be
fully
presented
some
readers
of
course
would
reject
even
the
fact
that
the
saucers
existed
others
would
cling
to
the
idea
that
they
were
of
earthly
origin
but
the
mass
of
evidence
would
make
most
readers
think
at
the
very
least
it
would
plant
one
strong
suggestion
that
we
men
and
women
of
the
earth
are
not
the
only
intelligent
species
in
the
universe
when
the
article
was
finished
it
was
tried
out
on
true
staff
then
on
a
picked
group
that
had
not
known
about
the
investigation
one
editor
summed
up
the
average
opinion
it
will
cause
a
lot
of
discussion
but
the
way
it
written
it
should
start
any
panic
the
january
issue
in
which
the
story
ran
was
due
on
the
stands
shortly
after
christmas
with
my
family
i
had
gone
to
ottumwa
iowa
to
spend
the
holidays
with
my
mother
and
sister
while
i
was
there
the
story
broke
unexpectedly
on
radio
networks
frank
edwards
mutual
network
newscaster
led
off
the
radio
comment
he
was
followed
by
walter
winchell
lowell
thomas
morgan
beatty
and
most
of
the
other
radio
commentators
the
wire
services
quickly
picked
it
up
some
papers
ran
stories
the
publicity
was
far
more
than
i
had
expected
i
phoned
a
reporter
in
washington
whose
beat
includes
the
pentagon
the
air
force
is
running
around
in
circles
he
told
me
they
knew
your
story
was
due
but
nobody
thought
it
would
raise
such
a
fuss
i
think
they
scared
of
hysteria
they
getting
a
barrage
of
wires
and
telephone
calls
that
night
as
i
was
packing
to
rush
back
east
he
called
with
the
latest
news
they
going
to
deny
the
whole
thing
he
said
but
i
heard
one
press
branch
guy
say
it
might
not
be
enough
they
trying
to
figure
some
way
to
knock
it
down
fast
next
day
while
changing
trains
at
chicago
i
saw
the
air
force
statement
the
press
release
was
dated
december
without
mentioning
true
the
air
force
flatly
denied
having
any
evidence
that
flying
saucers
exist
after
examining
reports
the
release
said
project
saucer
had
found
that
they
were
caused
by
misinterpretation
of
various
conventional
objects
a
mild
form
of
mass
hysteria
or
war
nerves
individuals
who
fabricate
such
reports
to
perpetrate
a
hoax
or
to
seek
publicity
evaluation
of
the
reports
of
unidentified
flying
objects
said
the
air
force
demonstrates
that
they
constitute
no
direct
threat
to
the
national
security
of
the
united
states
then
came
the
clincher
project
saucer
said
the
air
force
had
been
discontinued
now
that
all
the
reports
had
been
explained
it
was
plain
that
the
release
had
been
hastily
prepared
it
completely
contradicted
the
detailed
project
saucer
report
issued
eight
months
before
that
had
called
for
constant
vigilance
after
admitting
that
most
important
cases
were
unsolved
anyone
familiar
with
the
situation
would
see
the
discrepancy
at
once
from
washington
i
flew
to
new
york
where
i
found
true
in
a
turmoil
calls
were
pouring
in
letters
on
flying
saucers
had
swamped
the
mail
room
reporters
were
hounding
purdy
for
more
information
a
hurried
analysis
of
the
first
hundred
letters
showed
a
trend
that
later
mail
confirmed
less
than
per
cent
of
the
readers
ridiculed
the
article
between
and
per
cent
said
they
were
not
convinced
a
few
of
these
admitted
they
could
not
refute
the
evidence
about
half
the
readers
accepted
the
possibility
most
of
these
said
they
saw
no
reason
why
other
planets
should
not
be
inhabited
the
remainder
between
and
per
cent
said
they
were
completely
convinced
even
the
disbelievers
asked
for
more
information
the
intelligence
level
of
the
average
letter
was
gratifyingly
high
comments
came
from
scientists
engineers
airline
and
private
pilots
college
professors
officers
of
the
armed
services
and
a
wide
variety
of
others
including
far
more
women
than
true
readership
usually
includes
several
confidential
tips
had
come
in
when
i
arrived
most
of
them
were
from
usually
reputable
sources
we
were
given
evidence
that
project
saucer
was
still
in
operation
since
its
true
code
name
was
not
saucer
it
could
be
continued
without
violating
the
air
force
press
release
this
same
information
was
received
from
a
dozen
sources
within
the
next
two
weeks
we
were
also
told
that
there
had
been
cases
instead
of
meantime
a
number
of
astronomers
had
come
out
with
statements
pro
and
con
one
of
these
was
dean
mclaughlin
of
the
university
of
michigan
no
one
knows
what
the
saucers
are
as
yet
mclaughlin
said
they
could
be
anything
and
i
willing
to
be
convinced
once
the
evidence
is
presented
bart
bok
of
harvard
was
on
the
fence
after
all
he
said
all
sort
of
things
float
around
in
space
but
i
not
convinced
the
saucers
are
anything
apart
from
the
earth
another
harvard
astronomer
armin
deutsch
took
an
oblique
poke
at
true
and
me
i
do
think
anyone
and
that
includes
astronomers
knows
enough
about
them
to
reach
any
conclusions
after
this
came
the
comment
of
carl
von
weizacker
that
billions
of
stars
may
have
planets
and
many
could
be
inhabited
within
a
few
days
we
had
a
huge
stack
of
clippings
some
supporting
true
some
deriding
us
in
the
midst
of
all
this
i
read
comments
on
einstein
new
theory
which
had
been
printed
about
the
time
true
appeared
on
the
stands
a
discussion
by
lincoln
barnett
author
of
the
universe
and
einstein
explained
the
basic
premise
that
gravitation
and
electromagnetic
force
are
inseparable
as
i
read
it
i
thought
of
what
redell
had
said
if
gravitation
were
a
manifestation
of
electromagnetic
force
was
it
possible
that
an
advanced
race
had
found
a
way
as
unique
as
splitting
the
atom
to
offset
gravity
and
utilize
that
force
it
was
during
these
first
tense
days
that
we
ran
down
the
white
sands
story
this
also
ended
another
puzzle
the
identity
of
the
magazine
that
we
had
feared
might
scoop
us
the
race
had
been
closer
than
we
knew
the
editors
of
a
national
magazine
had
learned
of
commander
mclaughlin
and
the
sightings
at
white
sands
two
of
the
staff
had
carefully
investigated
the
details
convinced
that
the
report
was
accurate
they
had
planned
to
run
the
story
in
an
early
issue
since
true
had
appeared
first
with
the
story
the
editors
agreed
to
release
the
mclaughlin
report
for
use
in
our
march
issue
the
basic
facts
were
in
close
agreement
with
what
redell
had
told
me
the
saucer
had
been
tracked
at
a
height
of
miles
its
speed
miles
per
second
this
was
miles
per
hour
even
faster
than
redell
had
said
the
strange
craft
feet
in
length
had
climbed
as
swiftly
as
marvin
miles
had
described
it
an
increase
in
altitude
of
about
miles
in
seconds
commander
mclaughlin
stated
in
his
article
that
he
was
convinced
the
object
was
a
space
ship
from
another
planet
operated
by
animate
intelligent
beings
he
also
described
two
small
circular
objects
about
twenty
inches
in
diameter
that
streaked
up
beside
a
navy
missile
after
maneuvering
around
it
for
a
moment
both
disks
accelerated
passed
the
navy
missile
and
disappeared
it
is
commander
mclaughlin
opinion
that
the
saucers
come
from
mars
pointing
out
that
mars
was
in
a
good
position
to
see
our
surface
on
july
he
believes
that
the
flash
of
the
first
at
alamogordo
base
a
point
not
far
from
white
sands
was
caught
by
powerful
telescopes
during
the
first
week
of
january
i
appeared
on
we
the
people
with
lieutenant
george
gorman
when
i
saw
gorman
before
rehearsals
he
seemed
oddly
constrained
i
had
a
feeling
that
he
had
been
warned
about
talking
freely
during
rehearsals
he
changed
his
lines
in
the
script
when
the
writers
argued
over
a
point
gorman
told
them
i
can
say
only
what
was
in
my
published
report
nothing
else
the
day
before
the
broadcast
a
program
official
told
me
they
had
been
told
to
include
the
air
force
denial
in
the
script
that
afternoon
i
learned
that
the
air
force
planned
to
monitor
the
broadcast
meantime
an
story
carried
a
new
air
force
announcement
formerly
secret
project
saucer
files
would
be
opened
to
newsmen
at
the
pentagon
giving
the
answers
to
all
the
saucer
reports
just
after
my
return
to
washington
i
saw
an
story
that
was
widely
printed
it
was
an
interview
with
major
jerry
boggs
a
project
saucer
intelligence
officer
who
served
as
liaison
man
between
wright
field
and
the
pentagon
major
boggs
had
been
asked
for
specific
answers
to
the
mantell
and
gorman
cases
the
answers
he
gave
amazed
me
i
picked
up
the
phone
and
called
the
air
force
press
branch
after
some
delay
i
was
told
that
major
boggs
was
being
briefed
for
assignment
to
germany
an
interview
would
be
almost
impossible
he
was
too
busy
to
talk
with
i
said
all
i
want
is
thirty
minutes
later
jack
shea
a
civilian
press
official
i
had
known
for
some
time
arranged
for
the
meeting
i
was
also
to
talk
with
general
sory
smith
deputy
director
for
air
information
major
jesse
stay
a
press
branch
officer
took
me
to
general
office
for
the
interview
both
jesse
and
jack
shea
pleasant
obliging
chaps
who
had
helped
me
in
the
past
tried
earnestly
to
convince
me
the
saucers
did
exist
jesse
was
still
trying
when
major
boggs
came
in
boggs
looked
to
be
in
his
twenties
younger
than
i
had
expected
he
was
trim
well
built
with
a
quietly
alert
face
two
rows
of
ribbons
testified
to
his
wartime
service
when
jesse
stay
introduced
me
boggs
gave
me
a
curiously
searching
look
it
could
have
been
merely
his
usual
way
of
appraising
people
he
met
but
all
through
our
talk
i
had
a
strong
feeling
that
he
was
on
his
guard
i
had
written
out
some
questions
but
first
i
mentioned
the
story
were
you
quoted
correctly
on
the
mantell
case
i
asked
yes
i
was
major
boggs
looked
me
squarely
in
the
eye
captain
mantell
was
chasing
the
planet
venus
it
was
so
incredible
that
i
shook
my
head
major
venus
was
practically
invisible
that
day
we
checked
with
astronomers
is
that
the
official
air
force
answer
yes
it
is
boggs
said
his
eyes
never
left
my
face
i
glanced
across
at
general
sory
smith
then
back
at
the
intelligence
major
that
a
flat
contradiction
of
project
report
last
april
after
they
had
checked
for
fifteen
months
they
said
positively
it
was
not
venus
it
was
still
unidentified
boggs
said
in
a
slow
unruffled
voice
they
rechecked
after
that
report
why
did
they
recheck
after
fifteen
months
i
asked
him
must
have
gone
over
those
figures
long
before
that
for
errors
if
my
question
annoyed
him
boggs
gave
no
sign
there
no
other
possible
answer
he
said
mantell
was
chasing
venus
chapter
xvii
for
a
moment
after
boggs
last
answer
i
had
an
impulse
to
end
the
interview
i
had
a
feeling
i
was
facing
a
sphinx
a
quiet
courteous
sphinx
in
an
air
force
uniform
i
was
sure
now
why
major
jerry
boggs
had
been
chosen
for
his
job
the
connecting
link
with
the
project
at
wright
field
no
one
would
ever
catch
this
man
off
guard
no
matter
what
secret
was
given
him
to
conceal
and
it
was
more
than
the
result
of
air
force
intelligence
training
his
manner
his
voice
carried
conviction
he
would
have
convinced
anyone
who
had
not
carefully
analyzed
the
godman
field
tragedy
i
made
one
more
attempt
do
the
godman
field
witnesses
colonel
hix
and
the
rest
believe
the
venus
answer
i
have
asked
them
said
boggs
so
i
could
say
what
about
the
case
i
asked
you
were
quoted
as
saying
they
saw
a
meteor
a
bolide
that
exploded
in
a
shower
of
sparks
that
right
said
boggs
and
gorman
was
chasing
a
lighted
balloon
again
the
intelligence
major
nodded
i
pointed
out
that
all
three
of
the
cases
mentioned
had
been
listed
as
unidentified
in
the
april
report
they
had
those
cases
for
months
i
said
what
new
facts
did
they
learn
boggs
said
calmly
they
just
made
a
final
analysis
and
those
were
the
answers
we
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
major
boggs
patiently
waited
i
began
to
realize
how
a
lawyer
must
feel
with
an
imperturbable
witness
and
boggs
unfailing
courtesy
began
to
make
me
embarrassed
major
i
said
i
hope
you
realize
this
is
not
a
personal
matter
as
an
intelligence
officer
if
you
told
to
give
certain
answers
he
smiled
for
the
first
time
that
all
right
but
not
hiding
a
thing
there
just
no
such
thing
as
a
flying
saucer
so
far
as
we
found
out
we
been
told
i
said
that
project
is
closed
that
you
just
changed
its
code
name
that
not
so
boggs
said
emphatically
the
contracts
are
ended
and
all
personnel
transferred
to
other
duty
then
the
announcement
was
caused
by
true
article
both
general
smith
and
major
jesse
stay
shook
their
heads
quickly
boggs
leaned
forward
eyeing
me
earnestly
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
finished
the
investigation
months
ago
around
the
end
of
august
or
early
in
september
we
just
got
around
to
announcing
it
last
october
i
said
i
was
told
the
investigation
was
still
going
on
they
said
there
were
no
new
answers
to
the
cases
just
mentioned
the
press
branch
had
been
informed
yet
boggs
explained
simply
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
i
said
in
april
the
air
force
called
for
vigilance
by
the
civilian
population
it
said
the
project
was
young
much
of
its
work
still
under
way
jesse
stay
interrupted
before
boggs
could
reply
don
the
press
branch
will
have
to
take
the
blame
for
that
the
report
was
carefully
checked
there
were
several
loose
statements
in
it
this
was
an
incredible
statement
i
was
sure
jesse
knew
it
but
the
case
reports
you
quoted
came
from
wright
field
as
of
april
all
the
major
cases
were
officially
unsolved
then
in
august
or
early
september
the
whole
thing
cleaned
up
from
what
major
boggs
says
that
pretty
hard
to
believe
no
one
answered
that
one
major
boggs
was
waiting
politely
for
the
next
question
i
picked
up
my
list
the
rest
of
the
interview
was
in
straight
style
q
do
you
know
about
the
white
sands
sightings
in
april
the
ones
commander
mclaughlin
has
written
up
a
yes
we
checked
the
reports
we
just
do
believe
them
q
one
of
the
witnesses
was
charles
moore
the
director
of
the
navy
project
at
minneapolis
he
considered
a
very
reputable
engineer
did
you
know
he
confirms
the
first
report
the
one
about
the
saucer
miles
up
at
a
speed
of
eighteen
thousand
miles
per
hour
a
yes
i
knew
about
him
we
think
he
was
mistaken
like
the
others
moore
says
it
was
absolutely
sure
it
was
not
hallucination
he
says
it
should
be
carefully
investigated
a
we
did
investigate
we
just
do
believe
they
saw
anything
q
could
i
see
the
complete
file
on
that
case
also
on
mantell
gorman
and
the
eastern
airlines
cases
a
that
out
of
my
province
q
if
project
saucer
is
ended
then
all
the
files
should
be
opened
a
well
the
summaries
have
been
cleared
and
you
can
see
them
q
no
i
mean
the
actual
files
is
there
any
reason
i
should
see
them
a
there
be
a
lot
of
material
to
search
through
each
case
has
a
separate
book
and
some
of
them
are
pretty
bulky
q
there
were
cases
in
all
were
there
a
no
nowhere
near
that
q
then
is
the
total
figure
i
mean
the
number
of
cases
project
saucer
listed
a
there
were
a
few
more
something
over
four
hundred
i
do
know
the
exact
figure
i
been
told
that
project
saucer
had
the
air
force
put
out
a
special
order
for
pilots
to
chase
flying
saucers
is
that
right
a
yes
that
right
q
did
that
include
national
guard
pilots
a
yes
it
did
when
the
project
first
started
checking
on
saucers
we
were
naturally
anxious
to
get
hold
of
one
of
the
things
we
told
the
pilots
to
do
practically
anything
in
reason
even
if
they
had
to
grab
one
by
the
tail
q
were
any
of
those
planes
armed
a
only
if
they
happened
to
have
guns
for
some
other
mission
like
gunnery
practice
q
we
heard
of
one
case
where
fighters
chased
a
saucer
to
a
high
altitude
one
of
them
emptied
his
guns
at
it
a
you
must
mean
that
new
jersey
affair
the
plane
was
armed
for
another
reason
q
no
i
meant
a
case
reported
out
at
luke
field
three
fighters
took
off
if
the
story
sent
us
is
correct
apparently
it
made
quite
a
commotion
that
was
back
in
a
it
might
have
happened
i
do
know
q
what
was
this
new
jersey
case
i
rather
not
discuss
any
more
cases
without
having
the
books
here
q
has
project
saucer
released
its
secret
pictures
a
what
pictures
there
were
any
that
amounted
to
anything
maybe
half
a
dozen
they
did
show
anything
just
spots
on
film
or
weather
balloons
at
a
distance
q
in
the
kenneth
arnold
case
did
some
forest
rangers
verify
his
report
a
well
there
were
some
people
who
claimed
they
saw
the
same
disks
but
we
found
out
later
they
heard
about
it
on
the
radio
q
did
they
draw
some
sketches
that
matched
arnold
i
never
heard
about
it
i
like
to
go
back
to
the
mantell
case
a
second
if
venus
was
so
bright
remember
mantell
thought
it
was
a
huge
metallic
object
why
did
the
pilot
who
made
the
search
later
on
a
well
it
was
venus
that
positive
but
i
ca
remember
all
the
details
without
the
case
books
q
one
more
question
major
have
any
reports
been
received
at
wright
field
since
project
saucer
closed
there
was
a
case
after
that
date
an
airliner
crew
at
this
point
major
jesse
stay
broke
in
it
all
up
to
the
local
commanders
now
if
they
want
to
receive
reports
of
anything
unusual
all
right
and
if
they
want
to
investigate
them
that
up
to
each
commander
but
no
project
teams
will
check
on
reports
all
ended
there
at
the
last
it
had
been
a
little
like
a
courtroom
scene
and
i
was
glad
the
interview
was
over
major
boggs
was
unruffled
as
ever
i
apologized
for
the
barrage
of
questions
and
thanked
him
for
being
so
decent
about
it
it
was
interesting
getting
your
viewpoint
he
said
he
smiled
still
the
courteous
sphinx
and
went
on
out
after
bogs
had
left
i
talked
with
general
smith
alone
i
told
him
i
was
not
convinced
i
like
to
see
the
complete
files
on
these
cases
i
mentioned
i
explained
also
i
like
to
talk
with
the
last
commanding
officer
or
senior
intelligence
officer
attached
to
project
i
not
sure
about
the
senior
officer
general
smith
answered
he
may
have
been
detached
already
but
i
do
see
any
reason
why
you
ca
see
those
files
i
phone
wright
field
and
call
you
i
was
about
to
leave
but
he
motioned
for
me
to
sit
down
i
can
understand
how
you
feel
about
the
mantell
report
general
smith
said
earnestly
i
knew
tommy
mantell
very
well
and
colonel
hix
is
a
classmate
of
mine
i
knew
neither
one
was
the
kind
to
have
hallucinations
that
case
got
me
at
first
you
believe
venus
is
the
true
answer
i
asked
him
he
seemed
surprised
it
must
be
if
wright
field
says
so
when
i
went
back
to
the
press
branch
i
asked
jack
shea
for
the
summaries
that
boggs
had
mentioned
he
got
them
for
me
two
collections
of
mimeographed
sheets
enclosed
in
black
binders
so
these
were
the
secret
files
across
the
hall
in
the
press
room
i
opened
one
book
at
random
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
this
a
meteorologist
should
compute
the
approximate
energy
required
to
evaporate
as
much
cloud
as
shown
in
the
incident
photographs
photographs
major
boggs
had
said
there
were
no
important
pictures
i
tucked
the
binders
under
my
arm
and
went
out
to
my
car
perhaps
these
books
hinted
at
more
than
boggs
had
realized
but
that
seem
likely
as
liaison
man
he
should
know
all
the
answers
i
was
almost
positive
that
he
did
but
i
was
equally
sure
they
were
the
answers
he
had
given
me
chapter
xviii
that
night
i
went
through
the
project
saucer
summary
of
cases
it
was
a
strange
experience
the
first
report
i
checked
was
the
mantell
case
nothing
that
boggs
had
said
had
changed
my
firm
opinion
i
knew
the
answer
was
not
venus
and
i
was
certain
boggs
knew
it
too
the
godman
field
incident
was
listed
as
case
the
report
also
touches
on
the
lockbourne
air
base
sighting
as
already
described
the
same
mysterious
object
or
a
similar
one
was
seen
moving
at
five
hundred
miles
an
hour
over
lockbourne
field
it
was
also
sighted
at
other
points
in
ohio
the
very
first
sentence
in
case
showed
a
determined
attempt
to
explain
away
the
object
that
mantell
chased
detailed
attention
should
be
given
to
any
possible
astronomical
body
or
phenomenon
which
might
serve
to
identify
the
object
or
objects
some
of
the
final
project
report
on
mantell
has
been
given
in
an
earlier
chapter
i
am
repeating
a
few
paragraphs
below
to
help
in
weighing
major
boggs
answer
these
are
official
statements
of
the
project
astronomer
on
january
venus
was
less
than
half
its
full
brilliance
however
under
exceptionally
good
atmospheric
conditions
and
with
the
eye
shielded
from
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
venus
might
be
seen
as
an
exceedingly
tiny
bright
point
of
light
it
is
possible
to
see
it
in
daytime
when
one
knows
exactly
where
to
look
of
course
the
chances
of
looking
at
the
right
spot
are
very
few
it
has
been
unofficially
reported
that
the
object
was
a
navy
cosmic
ray
balloon
if
this
can
be
established
it
is
to
be
preferred
as
an
explanation
however
if
reports
from
other
localities
refer
to
the
same
object
any
such
device
must
have
been
a
good
many
miles
high
to
in
order
to
have
been
seen
clearly
almost
simultaneously
from
places
miles
apart
this
absolutely
ruled
out
the
balloon
possibility
as
the
investigator
fully
realized
that
he
must
have
considered
the
answer
at
this
point
is
strongly
indicated
in
the
following
sentence
if
all
reports
were
of
a
single
object
in
the
knowledge
of
this
investigator
no
object
could
have
been
large
enough
and
far
enough
away
for
the
approximate
simultaneous
sightings
the
next
paragraph
of
this
project
saucer
report
practically
nullified
major
boggs
statement
that
venus
was
the
sole
explanation
it
is
most
unlikely
however
that
so
many
separate
persons
should
at
that
time
have
chanced
on
venus
in
the
daylight
sky
it
seems
therefore
much
more
probable
that
more
than
one
object
was
involved
the
sighting
might
have
included
two
or
more
balloons
or
aircraft
or
they
might
have
included
venus
in
the
fatal
chase
and
balloons
such
a
hypothesis
however
does
still
necessitate
the
inclusion
of
at
least
two
other
objects
than
venus
and
it
certainly
is
coincidental
that
so
many
people
would
have
chosen
this
one
day
to
be
confused
to
the
extent
of
reporting
the
matter
by
normal
airborne
objects
farther
on
in
the
summaries
i
found
a
report
that
has
an
extremely
significant
bearing
on
the
mantell
case
this
was
case
in
which
the
same
consultant
attempts
to
explain
a
strange
daylight
sighting
at
santa
fe
new
mexico
one
of
the
santa
fe
observers
described
the
mysterious
aerial
object
as
round
and
extremely
bright
like
a
dime
in
the
sky
here
is
what
the
project
saucer
investigator
had
to
say
the
magnitude
of
venus
was
approximately
the
same
as
on
january
it
could
have
been
visible
in
the
daylight
sky
it
would
have
appeared
however
more
like
a
pinpoint
of
brilliant
light
than
a
dime
in
the
sky
it
seems
unlikely
that
it
would
be
noticed
at
all
considering
discrepancies
in
the
two
reports
i
suggest
the
moon
in
a
gibbous
phase
in
daytime
this
is
unusual
and
most
people
are
not
used
to
it
so
that
they
fail
to
identify
it
while
this
hypothesis
has
little
to
correspond
to
either
report
it
is
worth
mentioning
it
seems
far
more
probable
that
some
type
of
balloon
was
the
object
in
this
case
both
the
godman
field
and
the
santa
fe
cases
were
almost
identical
so
far
as
the
visibility
of
venus
was
concerned
in
the
santa
fe
case
which
had
very
little
publicity
project
saucer
dropped
the
venus
explanation
as
a
practically
impossible
answer
but
in
case
it
had
tried
desperately
to
make
venus
loom
up
as
a
huge
gleaming
object
during
mantell
fatal
chase
there
was
only
one
explanation
project
saucer
must
have
known
the
truth
from
the
mantell
had
pursued
a
tremendous
space
ship
that
fact
alone
if
it
had
exploded
in
the
headlines
at
that
time
might
have
caused
dangerous
panic
to
make
it
worse
captain
mantell
had
been
killed
even
if
he
had
actually
died
from
blacking
out
while
trying
to
follow
the
swiftly
ascending
space
ship
few
would
have
believed
it
the
story
would
spread
like
wildfire
spacemen
kill
an
american
air
force
pilot
this
explained
the
tight
lid
that
had
been
clamped
down
at
once
on
the
mantell
case
it
was
more
than
a
year
before
that
policy
had
been
changed
then
the
first
official
discussions
of
possible
space
visitors
had
begun
to
appear
plans
to
announce
the
interplanetary
answer
would
have
fitted
a
program
of
preparing
the
people
but
the
air
force
had
not
expected
such
reaction
from
true
article
that
much
i
knew
evidently
they
had
not
suspected
such
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
godman
field
case
in
particular
i
could
see
now
why
boggs
jesse
stay
and
the
others
had
tried
so
hard
to
convince
me
that
we
had
made
a
mistake
it
was
quite
possible
that
we
had
revived
that
first
air
force
fear
of
dangerous
publicity
but
mantell
had
been
dead
for
two
years
news
stories
would
not
have
the
same
impact
now
even
if
they
did
report
that
spacemen
had
downed
the
pilot
and
i
doubted
that
there
would
be
headlines
unless
the
air
force
supplied
some
convincing
details
the
manner
of
his
death
would
still
be
speculation
apparently
i
had
been
right
this
case
was
the
key
to
the
riddle
it
had
been
the
first
major
sighting
in
project
saucer
had
been
started
immediately
afterward
in
searching
for
a
plausible
answer
which
could
be
published
if
needed
officials
had
probably
set
the
pattern
for
handling
all
other
reports
explaining
away
would
be
a
logical
program
until
the
public
could
be
prepared
for
an
official
announcement
as
i
went
through
other
case
reports
i
found
increasing
evidence
to
back
up
this
belief
case
the
muroc
air
base
sightings
had
plainly
baffled
project
men
seeking
a
plausible
answer
because
of
the
air
force
witnesses
they
could
not
ignore
the
reports
highly
trained
air
force
test
pilots
and
ground
officers
had
seen
two
disks
circling
over
the
base
flying
at
speeds
of
from
three
to
four
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
disks
whirled
in
amazingly
tight
maneuvers
since
they
were
only
eight
thousand
feet
above
the
field
these
turns
could
be
clearly
seen
it
is
tempting
to
explain
the
object
as
ordinary
aircraft
observed
under
unusual
light
conditions
the
case
report
reads
but
the
evidence
of
tight
circles
if
maintained
is
strongly
contradictory
although
case
was
technically
in
the
unexplained
group
wright
field
had
made
a
final
effort
to
explain
away
the
reports
said
the
air
materiel
command
the
sightings
were
the
result
of
misinterpretation
of
real
stimuli
probably
research
balloons
in
all
the
world
history
there
is
no
record
of
a
wind
to
cover
the
distance
involved
the
drifting
balloons
would
have
had
to
move
at
this
speed
or
faster
if
a
wind
had
been
blowing
at
eight
thousand
feet
nothing
on
earth
could
have
stood
it
muroc
air
base
would
have
been
blown
off
the
map
what
did
the
muroc
test
pilots
really
see
that
day
while
searching
for
the
report
ran
across
the
fairfield
suisan
case
which
i
had
learned
about
in
seattle
this
was
case
the
project
saucer
comment
reads
if
the
observations
were
exactly
as
stated
by
the
witnesses
the
ball
of
light
could
not
be
a
fireball
a
fireball
would
not
have
come
into
view
at
feet
and
risen
to
if
correct
there
is
no
astronomical
explanation
under
unusual
conditions
a
fireball
might
appear
to
rise
somewhat
as
a
result
of
perspective
the
absence
of
trail
and
sound
definitely
does
not
favor
the
meteor
hypothesis
but
does
not
rule
it
out
finally
it
does
not
seem
likely
any
meteor
or
auroral
phenomenon
could
be
as
bright
as
this
then
came
one
of
the
most
revealing
lines
in
all
the
case
reports
in
the
almost
hopeless
absence
of
any
other
natural
explanation
one
must
consider
the
possibility
of
the
object
having
been
a
meteor
even
though
the
description
does
not
fit
very
well
one
officer
i
recalled
had
insisted
that
the
object
had
been
a
lighted
balloon
checking
the
secret
report
from
the
air
weather
service
i
found
this
case
very
high
winds
miles
per
hour
from
southwest
all
levels
definitely
prohibits
any
balloon
from
southerly
motion
this
case
is
officially
listed
as
answered
in
case
where
a
object
was
seen
at
dayton
ohio
the
project
investigator
made
a
valiant
attempt
to
fit
an
answer
possibly
a
close
pair
of
fireballs
but
it
seems
unlikely
if
one
were
to
stretch
the
description
to
its
very
limits
and
make
allowances
for
untrained
observers
he
could
say
that
the
shape
might
have
been
illusion
caused
by
rapid
motion
and
that
the
bright
sunlight
might
have
made
both
the
objects
and
the
trails
nearly
invisible
this
investigator
does
not
prefer
that
interpolation
and
it
should
he
resorted
to
only
if
all
other
possible
explanations
fail
this
case
too
is
officially
listed
as
answered
case
which
occurred
june
twelve
days
before
the
arnold
sighting
shows
the
same
determined
attempt
to
find
an
explanation
no
matter
how
farfetched
in
this
case
two
objects
were
seen
at
weiser
idaho
twice
they
approached
the
earth
then
swiftly
circled
upward
the
project
investigator
tried
hard
to
prove
that
these
might
have
been
parts
of
a
double
fireball
but
at
the
end
he
said
in
spite
of
all
this
this
investigator
would
prefer
a
terrestrial
explanation
for
the
incident
it
was
plain
that
this
report
had
not
been
planned
originally
for
release
to
the
public
no
project
investigator
would
have
been
so
frank
with
each
new
report
i
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
these
had
been
confidential
discussions
of
various
possible
answers
circulated
between
project
saucer
officials
why
they
had
been
released
now
was
still
a
puzzle
though
i
began
to
see
a
glimmer
of
the
answer
the
sighting
was
listed
as
case
as
i
started
on
the
report
i
wondered
if
major
boggs
bolide
answer
would
have
any
more
foundation
than
these
other
astronomical
cases
the
report
began
with
these
words
there
is
no
astronomical
explanation
if
we
accept
the
report
at
face
value
but
the
sheer
improbability
of
the
facts
as
stated
particularly
in
the
absence
of
any
known
aircraft
in
the
vicinity
makes
it
necessary
to
see
whether
any
other
explanation
even
though
farfetched
can
be
considered
after
this
candid
admission
of
his
intentions
the
project
consultant
earnestly
attempts
to
fit
the
two
pilots
space
ship
description
to
a
meteor
it
will
have
to
be
left
to
the
psychologists
he
goes
on
to
tell
us
whether
the
immediate
trail
of
a
bright
meteor
could
produce
the
subjective
impression
of
a
ship
with
lighted
windows
considering
only
the
sighting
the
hypothesis
seems
very
improbable
as
i
mentioned
in
an
earlier
chapter
observers
at
robbins
air
force
base
macon
georgia
saw
the
same
mysterious
object
streak
overhead
trailing
varicolored
flames
this
was
about
one
hour
before
chiles
and
whitted
saw
the
onrushing
space
ship
to
bolster
up
the
meteor
theory
the
project
consultant
suggests
a
error
in
time
the
explanation
the
airliner
would
be
on
time
if
there
is
no
time
difference
he
proceeds
the
object
must
have
been
an
extraordinary
meteor
in
which
case
it
would
have
covered
the
distance
from
macon
to
montgomery
in
a
minute
or
two
having
checked
the
time
angle
before
i
knew
this
was
incorrect
both
reports
were
given
in
eastern
standard
time
and
in
a
later
part
of
the
project
report
the
consultant
admits
this
fact
but
he
has
an
alternate
answer
if
the
difference
in
time
is
real
the
object
was
some
form
of
known
aircraft
regardless
of
its
bizarre
nature
the
bizarre
nature
is
not
specified
nor
does
the
project
saucer
report
try
to
fit
the
robbins
field
description
to
any
aircraft
the
observers
were
struck
by
the
object
huge
size
its
shape
and
the
weird
flames
trailing
behind
except
for
the
windows
the
men
description
tallied
with
the
pilots
with
the
ship
at
five
thousand
feet
or
higher
its
windows
would
not
have
been
visible
from
the
ground
all
the
observers
agreed
on
the
object
very
high
speed
neither
of
the
project
saucer
alternate
answers
will
fit
the
facts
the
interval
has
been
proved
correct
therefore
as
the
project
consultant
admits
it
could
not
be
a
meteor
the
robbins
field
witnesses
have
flatly
denied
it
was
a
conventional
plane
the
air
force
screened
airplane
schedules
and
proved
there
was
no
such
plane
in
the
area
no
ordinary
aircraft
would
have
caused
the
brilliant
streak
that
startled
the
passenger
and
both
of
the
pilots
major
boggs
bolide
answer
had
gone
the
way
of
his
venus
explanation
i
wondered
if
the
gorman
solution
would
fade
out
the
same
way
but
the
project
report
on
gorman
case
merely
hinted
at
the
balloon
answer
in
the
appendix
there
was
a
brief
comment
note
that
standard
inch
and
inch
weather
balloons
have
vertical
speeds
of
and
feet
per
minute
respectively
in
all
the
reports
i
have
mentioned
and
on
through
both
the
case
books
one
thing
was
immediately
obvious
all
the
testimony
all
the
actual
evidence
was
missing
these
were
only
the
declared
conclusions
of
project
saucer
whether
they
matched
the
actual
conclusions
in
wright
field
secret
files
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
but
even
in
these
sketch
reports
i
found
some
odd
hints
clues
to
what
project
officials
might
really
be
thinking
after
an
analysis
of
two
indianapolis
cases
one
investigator
reports
barring
hallucination
these
two
incidents
and
and
seem
the
most
tangible
from
the
standpoint
of
description
of
all
those
reported
and
the
most
difficult
to
explain
away
as
sheer
nonsense
case
i
found
was
that
of
kenneth
arnold
but
in
spite
of
the
above
admission
that
this
case
can
not
be
explained
away
it
is
officially
listed
as
answered
case
struck
a
familiar
note
this
was
the
strange
occurrence
at
twin
falls
idaho
on
which
true
had
had
a
tip
months
before
a
disk
moving
through
a
canyon
at
tremendous
speed
had
whipped
the
treetops
as
if
by
a
violent
hurricane
the
report
was
brief
but
one
sentence
stood
out
with
a
startling
effect
twin
falls
idaho
august
the
report
began
there
is
clearly
nothing
astronomical
in
this
incident
two
points
stand
out
the
color
and
the
fact
that
the
trees
around
on
top
as
if
they
were
in
a
vacuum
then
came
the
sentence
that
made
me
sit
up
in
my
chair
apparently
it
must
be
classed
with
the
other
bona
fide
disk
sightings
the
other
bona
fide
sightings
was
this
a
slip
or
had
the
air
force
deliberately
left
this
report
in
the
file
if
they
had
what
was
back
of
it
what
was
back
of
releasing
all
of
these
telltale

i
skimmed
through
the

as
quickly
as
possible

other

going
back
over
this
group
of
cases
i
made
an
incredible
discovery
all
but
three
of
these
unsolved
cases
were
officially
listed
as
answered
the
three
were
the
united
airlines
case
the
white
sands
sightings
and
the
report
from
the
hague
going
back
to
the
first
report
i
checked
all
the
summaries
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
explanations
were
pure
conjecture
sometimes
no
answer
was
even
attempted
although
cases
were
mentioned
the
summaries
ended
with
case
several
cases
were
omitted
i
found
clues
to
some
of
these
in
the
secret
air
weather
service
report
including
the
mysterious
green
light
sightings
at
las
vegas
and
albuquerque
of
the
remaining
cases
project
saucer
lists
all
but
as
explained
these
unsolved
cases
are
brought
up
again
for
a
final
attempt
at
explaining
them
away
in
the
appendix
the
air
materiel
command
carefully
states
it
is
not
the
intent
to
discredit
the
character
of
observers
but
each
case
has
undesirable
elements
and
these
ca
be
disregarded
after
this
perfunctory
gesture
the
proceeds
to
discredit
completely
the
testimony
of
highly
trained
air
force
test
pilots
and
officers
at
muroc
the
research
balloon
explanation
the
then
brushes
off
the
report
of
captain
emil
smith
and
the
crew
of
a
united
airline
plane
on
july
nine
huge
flying
disks
were
counted
by
captain
smith
and
his
crew
the
strange
objects
were
in
sight
for
about
twelve
minutes
the
crew
watched
them
for
the
entire
period
and
described
them
in
detail
later
despite
project
saucer
admission
that
it
had
no
answer
the
contrived
one
ignoring
the
evidence
of
veteran
airline
pilots
it
said
since
the
sighting
occurred
at
sunset
when
illusory
effect
are
most
likely
the
objects
could
have
been
ordinary
aircraft
balloons
birds
or
pure
illusion
in
only
three
cases
did
the
admit
it
had
no
answer
even
here
it
was
implied
that
the
witnesses
were
either
confused
or
incompetent
in
its
press
release
of
december
the
air
force
had
mentioned
cases
it
implied
that
all
of
these
were
answered
the
truth
was
just
the
reverse
as
was
proved
by
these
case
books
almost
two
hundred
cases
still
were
shown
to
be
the
real
answers
might
be
hidden
in
wright
field
files
these
two
black
books
puzzled
me
why
had
the
air
force
lifted
its
secrecy
on
these
case
summaries
why
had
major
boggs
given
me
those
answers
when
these
books
would
flatly
refute
them
i
thought
i
new
the
reason
now
but
there
was
only
one
way
to
make
sure
the
actual
wright
field
files
should
tell
the
answer
when
i
phoned
general
sory
smith
his
voice
sounded
a
little
peculiar
i
called
wright
field
he
said
but
they
said
you
would
find
anything
of
value
out
there
you
mean
they
refused
to
let
me
see
their
files
no
i
did
say
that
but
they
short
of
personnel
they
want
to
take
people
off
other
jobs
to
look
up
the
records
i
wo
need
any
help
i
said
major
boggs
said
each
case
had
a
separate
book
if
they
just
show
me
the
shelves
i
could
do
the
job
in
two
days
there
was
a
long
silence
i
ask
them
again
the
general
said
finally
call
me
sometime
next
week
i
said
i
would
and
hung
up
the
message
from
wright
field
surprised
me
but
smith
changed
manner
did
he
had
sounded
oddly
disturbed
while
i
was
waiting
for
wright
field
answer
ken
purdy
phoned
he
told
me
that
staff
men
from
time
and
life
magazines
were
seriously
checking
on
the
little
men
story
both
purdy
and
i
were
sure
this
was
a
colossal
hoax
but
there
was
just
a
faint
chance
that
someone
had
been
on
the
fringe
of
a
real
happening
and
had
made
up
the
rest
of
the
story
they
key
man
in
the
story
seemed
to
be
one
george
koehler
of
denver
colorado
the
morning
after
purdy
called
i
took
a
plane
to
denver
during
the
flight
i
went
over
the
little
men
story
again
it
had
been
printed
in
over
a
hundred
papers
according
to
the
usual
version
george
koehler
had
accidentally
learned
of
two
crashed
saucers
at
a
radar
station
on
our
southwest
border
the
ships
were
made
of
some
strange
metal
the
cabin
was
stationary
placed
within
a
large
rotating
ring
here
is
the
story
as
it
was
told
in
the
kansas
city
star
in
flight
the
ring
revolved
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
while
the
cabin
remained
stationary
like
the
center
of
a
gyroscope
each
of
the
two
ships
seen
by
koehler
were
occupied
by
a
crew
of
two
in
the
badly
damaged
ship
these
bodies
were
charred
so
badly
that
little
could
be
learned
from
them
the
occupants
of
the
other
ship
while
dead
when
they
were
found
were
not
burned
or
disfigured
and
when
koehler
saw
them
were
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
medical
reports
according
to
koehler
showed
that
these
men
were
almost
identical
with
humans
except
for
a
few
minor
differences
they
were
of
a
uniform
height
of
three
feet
were
uniformly
blond
beardless
and
their
teeth
were
completely
free
of
fillings
or
cavities
they
did
not
wear
undergarments
but
had
their
bodies
taped
the
ships
seemed
to
be
magnetically
controlled
and
powered
in
addition
to
a
piece
of
metal
koehler
had
a
clock
or
automatic
calendar
taken
from
one
of
the
crafts
koehler
said
that
the
best
assumption
as
to
the
source
of
the
ships
was
the
planet
venus
when
i
arrived
at
denver
i
went
to
the
radio
station
where
koehler
worked
i
told
him
that
if
he
had
proof
that
we
could
print
we
would
buy
the
story
as
the
first
substantial
proof
i
asked
to
see
the
piece
of
strange
metal
he
was
supposed
to
have
koehler
said
it
had
been
sent
to
another
city
to
be
analyzed
i
asked
to
see
pictures
of
the
crashed
saucers
these
too
proved
to
be
somewhere
else
so
did
the
queer
space
clock
that
koehler
was
said
to
have
by
this
time
i
was
sure
it
was
all
a
gag
i
had
the
feeling
that
koehler
back
of
his
manner
of
seeming
indignation
at
my
demands
was
hugely
enjoying
himself
i
cut
the
interview
short
and
called
ken
purdy
in
new
york
well
thank
god
that
laid
to
rest
he
said
when
i
told
him
but
even
though
the
little
men
story
had
turned
expected
a
dud
koehler
had
done
me
a
good
turn
an
old
friend
william
barrett
fiction
writer
now
lived
in
denver
thanks
to
koehler
gag
i
had
a
pleasant
visit
with
bill
and
his
family
on
the
trip
back
i
bought
a
paper
at
the
chicago
airport
on
an
inside
page
i
ran
across
koehler
name
according
to
the
he
had
just
admitted
the
whole
thing
was
a
big
joke
but
in
spite
of
this
the
little
men
story
goes
on
and
on
apparently
not
even
koehler
can
stop
it
now
chapter
xix
for
two
weeks
after
my
return
to
washington
general
sory
smith
held
off
a
final
answer
about
my
trip
to
wright
field
meantime
ken
purdy
had
called
him
backing
my
request
to
see
the
project
files
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
wright
field
was
determined
not
to
open
the
files
but
the
general
was
trying
to
avoid
making
it
official
why
ca
you
accept
my
word
there
nothing
to
the
saucers
he
asked
me
one
day
you
impeaching
my
personal
veracity
but
finally
he
saw
there
was
no
other
way
out
he
told
me
i
had
been
officially
refused
permission
to
see
the
wright
field
files
some
time
later
ken
purdy
phoned
general
smith
general
if
the
air
force
wants
to
talk
to
us
off
the
record
play
ball
true
will
either
handle
it
from
then
on
whatever
way
you
think
best
or
we
keep
still
whether
this
offer
was
relayed
higher
up
i
do
know
but
nothing
came
of
it
meantime
saucer
reports
had
begun
to
come
in
from
all
over
the
country
some
even
came
from
abroad
some
of
these
sightings
have
already
been
mentioned
in
early
chapters
besides
the
strange
affair
at
tucson
on
february
there
were
several
other
cases
in
february
three
of
these
were
in
south
america
one
saucer
was
reported
near
the
naval
air
station
at
alameda
california
some
were
sighted
in
texas
new
mexico
and
other
parts
of
the
southwest
in
march
the
wave
of
sightings
reached
such
a
height
that
the
air
force
again
denied
the
saucers
existence
this
followed
a
report
that
a
flying
disk
had
crashed
near
mexico
city
and
that
the
wreckage
had
been
viewed
by
air
force
officials
scores
of
orangeburg
south
carolina
residents
watched
a
disk
that
hovered
over
that
city
on
march
it
was
described
as
turning
slowly
in
the
air
before
it
disappeared
the
day
before
this
residents
of
van
nuys
california
saw
a
bright
disk
moving
swiftly
four
hundred
feet
in
the
air
seen
through
a
telescope
it
appeared
to
be
fifty
feet
in
diameter
disks
were
reported
at
numerous
places
in
mexico
including
guadalajara
juárez
mazatlán
and
durango
on
the
twelfth
of
march
the
crew
and
passengers
of
an
american
airlines
ship
saw
a
large
gleaming
disk
high
above
monterrey
airport
in
mexico
captain
hunt
the
senior
airline
pilot
watched
the
disk
through
a
theodolite
at
the
airport
this
disk
and
most
of
the
others
seen
in
mexico
were
similar
in
description
to
the
one
sighted
at
dayton
ohio
on
march
this
was
the
large
metallic
saucer
that
hovered
high
over
vandalia
airport
until
air
force
and
national
guard
fighters
raced
up
after
it
the
disk
rose
vertically
into
the
sky
at
incredible
speed
hovered
a
while
longer
and
then
vanished
within
hours
this
mystery
disk
had
been
identified
as
the
planet
venus
it
was
broad
daylight
newspapers
quoted
trained
astronomical
officials
in
dayton
as
the
source
for
this
explanation
meanwhile
the
mexican
government
newspaper
el
nacional
quoted
a
famous
and
reputable
astronomer
as
saying
the
numerous
disks
reported
over
mexico
carry
visitors
from
mars
one
of
the
strangest
reports
came
from
the
naval
air
station
at
dallas
texas
it
was
about
on
march
when
cpo
charles
lewis
saw
a
disk
streak
up
at
a
bomber
the
disk
appeared
about
twenty
to
feet
in
diameter
lewis
reported
racing
at
incredible
speed
it
shot
up
under
the
bomber
hung
there
for
a
second
then
broke
away
at
a
angle
following
this
it
shot
straight
up
into
the
air
and
disappeared
captain
a
nation
of
the
station
said
it
was
i
the
second
report
in
ten
days
on
march
said
captain
nation
a
tower
control
operator
named
edmundson
saw
a
similar
disk
flying
so
fast
it
was
almost
a
blur
he
estimated
its
speed
at
three
thousand
to
four
thousand
miles
per
hour
captain
nation
stated
of
course
he
had
no
instruments
to
compute
the
speed
so
that
a
pure
estimate
it
was
some
time
before
this
when
i
heard
the
first
crazy
rumor
about
the
display
this
story
which
had
new
details
every
time
i
heard
it
described
the
air
force
as
refusing
to
let
the
navy
announce
a
new
type
of
missile
according
to
the
rumors
the
air
force
was
trying
to
prove
its
own
missile
far
superior
to
keep
the
navy
from
invading
its
bombing
domain
then
the
army
joined
the
pitched
battle
with
still
a
third
guided
missile
according
to
the
rumors
and
the
flying
disks
army
navy
and
air
force
missiles
launched
in
droves
all
over
the
country
to
prove
whose
was
the
best
a
public
missile
race
with
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
to
decide
the
winner
it
seems
fantastic
that
this
theory
would
be
believed
by
any
intelligent
person
in
effect
it
accuses
the
armed
services
of
deliberate
criminal
negligence
of
endangering
millions
in
the
cities
below
i
am
convinced
that
some
of
these
rumors
led
to
at
least
one
of
the
published
guesses
about
our
missile
program
one
widely
publicized
story
stated
that
the
flying
saucers
seen
hurtling
through
our
skies
are
actually
two
types
of
secret
weapons
one
according
to
radio
and
newspaper
accounts
is
a
disk
that
whizzes
through
space
halts
suspended
in
the
air
soars
to
thirty
thousand
feet
drops
to
one
thousand
feet
and
then
usually
disintegrates
in
the
air
these
saucers
it
was
said
ranged
from
inches
to
feet
in
diameter
they
were
supposed
to
be
pilotless
and
harmless
the
second
type
was
said
to
be
a
jet
version
of
the
navy
circular
airfoil
flying
flapjack
it
was
credited
with
fantastic
speed
the
true
disks
however
were
mainly
air
force
devices
according
to
the
report
some
are
guided
others
are
not
said
the
radio
commentator
who
released
this
story
they
can
stay
stationary
dash
off
to
right
or
left
and
move
like
lightning
but
they
are
utterly
harmless
in
these
harmless
disks
there
was
supposed
to
be
an
explosive
charge
that
destroyed
them
in
at
a
predetermined
time
within
a
few
days
after
this
story
was
broadcast
the
united
states
news
and
world
report
declared
that
the
saucers
are
real
and
identified
them
as
jet
models
of
navy
flying
flapjacks
this
magazine
which
is
not
an
official
publication
despite
its
name
mentioned
the
jet
principle
that
i
had
previously
described
in
the
true
article
these
two
explanations
brought
denials
from
the
white
house
the
navy
and
the
air
force
the
air
force
flatly
declared
that
none
of
the
armed
forces
is
conducting
secret
experiments
with
flying
objects
that
could
be
a
basis
for
the
reported
phenomena
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
latter
stem
from
the
activities
of
any
foreign
nation
before
this
president
truman
stated
he
knew
nothing
of
any
such
objects
being
developed
by
the
united
states
or
any
other
nation
the
navy
denial
came
immediately
after
the
first
broadcast
story
it
ran
the
navy
is
not
engaged
in
research
or
in
flying
any
aircraft
the
navy
added
that
one
model
of
a
aircraft
called
the
zimmerman
skimmer
was
built
but
was
never
flown
however
a
small
scale
model
did
fly
and
was
under
radio
control
during
flight
this
last
device
is
now
being
rumored
as
the
unpiloted
missile
said
to
have
been
launched
over
the
country
like
the
harmless
disks
even
though
all
these
accounts
have
been
officially
denied
many
americans
may
still
believe
they
are
true
i
have
no
desire
to
criticize
the
authors
of
these
stories
i
believe
that
in
following
up
certain
leads
they
were
misled
into
accepting
the
conclusions
they
gave
but
these
stories
particularly
the
accounts
of
huge
unpiloted
disks
may
have
planted
certain
fears
in
the
public
that
are
completely
unwarranted
for
this
reason
i
have
personally
checked
at
washington
in
regard
to
the
dangers
of
unpiloted
missiles
here
aye
the
facts
i
learned
neither
the
army
navy
nor
air
force
has
at
any
time
staged
any
competition
as
rumored
no
unpiloted
missiles
or
experimental
craft
have
been
tested
over
american
cities
or
heavily
populated
areas
no
unpiloted
missile
carrying
dangerous
explosives
whether
for
destruction
of
the
device
or
other
purposes
has
been
deliberately
launched
or
tested
over
heavily
populated
areas
in
regard
to
the
flying
flapjack
i
have
been
assured
by
admiral
calvin
bolster
of
the
navy
bureau
of
aeronautics
that
this
type
of
plane
has
never
been
produced
i
concede
that
he
might
make
this
statement
to
conceal
a
secret
development
but
there
is
one
fact
of
which
every
american
can
be
certain
neither
this
type
nor
the
smaller
model
has
been
or
will
be
flown
or
launched
over
areas
where
people
would
be
endangered
the
three
armed
services
are
working
on
guided
missiles
they
are
not
risking
american
lives
by
launching
such
missiles
at
random
across
the
united
states
although
most
of
our
projects
are
secret
it
is
possible
to
give
certain
facts
about
developments
in
general
the
first
successful
missiles
were
produced
by
the
germans
these
were
the
and
the
rocket
but
research
in
various
other
types
was
carried
on
during
the
war
some
of
this
was
with
oval
and
round
types
of
airfoils
as
already
stated
by
paul
redell
there
is
strong
evidence
that
the
foil
resulted
from
german
observations
of
either
space
ships
or
observer
units
all
the
nazi
plans
followed
this
discovery
that
we
were
being
observed
by
a
race
from
another
planet
after
the
end
of
world
war
ii
the
international
race
began
with
the
british
russians
and
ourselves
as
the
chief
contenders
numerous
types
have
been
bombs
small
projectiles
launched
from
planes
and
and
missiles
equipped
with
target
homing
devices
in
certain
recent
types
the
range
can
be
stated
as
several
hundred
miles
so
far
as
i
have
learned
after
weeks
of
rechecking
this
point
not
a
single
missile
has
been
identified
as
russian
since
this
country
is
working
closely
with
great
britain
on
global
defense
problems
it
is
no
violation
of
security
to
say
that
we
have
probably
exchanged
certain
information
in
regard
to
the
british
missile
picture
outlined
to
me
by
john
steele
i
can
state
two
major
facts
the
british
have
categorically
denied
testing
such
missiles
over
american
territory
where
they
might
endanger
american
citizens
there
is
convincing
evidence
that
they
are
telling
the
truth
there
is
no
british
missile
now
built
or
planned
that
could
explain
the
objects
seen
by
captain
mantell
chiles
and
whitted
and
witnesses
in
most
of
the
major
sightings
the
preceding
statement
applies
equally
to
missiles
there
is
no
experimental
craft
or
guided
missile
even
remotely
considered
in
this
country
that
would
begin
to
approach
the
dimensions
and
performance
of
the
space
ships
seen
in
these
cases
there
is
concrete
evidence
that
the
united
states
is
as
well
advanced
as
any
other
nation
in
development
certain
recent
advances
should
place
us
in
the
lead
unless
confidential
reports
on
soviet
progress
are
completely
wrong
if
american
scientists
and
engineers
can
learn
the
source
of
the
space
ships
power
and
adapt
it
to
our
use
it
may
well
be
the
means
for
ending
the
threat
of
war
the
soviet
scientists
are
well
aware
of
this
their
research
into
cosmic
rays
and
other
natural
forces
has
been
redoubled
since
the
reports
of
the
secret
of
the
space
ships
power
is
more
important
than
even
the
hydrogen
bomb
it
may
someday
be
the
key
to
the
fate
of
the
world
chapter
xx
after
one
year
investigation
of
the
flying
saucers
and
air
force
operations
i
have
come
to
the
following
conclusions
the
air
force
was
puzzled
and
badly
worried
when
the
disks
first
were
sighted
in
the
air
force
began
to
suspect
the
truth
soon
after
death
perhaps
even
before
project
saucer
was
set
up
to
investigate
and
at
the
same
time
conceal
from
the
public
the
truth
about
the
saucers
during
the
spring
of
this
policy
which
had
been
strictly
maintained
by
forrestal
underwent
an
abrupt
change
on
orders
it
was
decided
to
let
the
facts
gradually
leak
out
in
order
to
prepare
the
american
people
this
was
the
reason
for
the
april
report
with
its
suggestions
about
space
visitors
while
i
was
preparing
the
article
for
the
january
issue
of
true
it
had
been
considered
in
line
with
the
general
education
program
but
the
unexpected
public
reaction
was
mistaken
by
the
air
force
for
hysteria
resulting
in
their
hasty
denial
that
the
saucers
existed
because
the
air
force
feared
any
closer
analysis
of
the
mantell
case
major
boggs
was
instructed
to
publicize
the
venus
explanation
although
it
had
been
denied
the
air
force
knew
that
most
people
had
forgotten
this
or
had
never
known
it
major
boggs
having
stated
this
answer
publicly
along
with
the
other
and
gorman
answers
was
forced
to
stick
to
it
though
he
knew
it
was
wrong
and
that
the
case
summaries
would
prove
it
the
case
summaries
were
released
to
a
small
number
of
washington
newsmen
to
continue
planting
the
thought
this
decision
being
made
after
true
reception
proved
to
the
air
force
that
the
public
was
better
prepared
than
had
been
thought
in
regard
to
the
flying
saucers
themselves
i
believe
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
space
ships
are
the
answer
the
earth
has
been
under
periodic
observation
from
another
planet
or
other
planets
for
at
least
two
centuries
this
observation
suddenly
increased
in
following
the
series
of
explosions
begun
in
the
observation
now
intermittent
is
part
of
a
survey
and
will
continue
indefinitely
no
immediate
attempt
to
contact
the
earth
seems
evident
there
may
be
some
unknown
block
to
making
contact
but
it
is
more
probable
that
the
spacemen
plans
are
not
complete
i
believe
that
the
air
force
is
still
investigating
the
saucer
sightings
either
through
the
air
materiel
command
or
some
other
headquarters
it
is
possible
that
some
air
force
officials
still
fear
a
panic
when
the
truth
is
officially
revealed
in
that
case
we
may
continue
for
a
long
time
to
see
routine
denials
alternating
with
new
suggestions
of
interplanetary
travel
the
education
problem
is
complicated
by
two
imperative
needs
we
must
try
to
learn
as
much
as
we
can
about
the
space
ships
source
of
power
and
at
the
same
time
try
to
prevent
clues
to
this
information
from
reaching
an
enemy
on
earth
if
censorship
is
suddenly
imposed
on
all
reports
this
will
be
the
chief
reason
this
would
also
help
solve
a
minor
problem
where
partial
censorship
now
exists
a
few
test
missiles
launched
from
a
southwest
base
have
been
seen
by
citizens
at
a
distance
from
the
proving
grounds
in
some
cases
their
reports
have
got
into
local
papers
though
the
wire
services
did
not
carry
them
these
missile
tests
are
peculiarly
different
from
the
general
run
of
reports
contrasted
with
the
mantell
and
other
sightings
they
stand
out
with
a
certain
pattern
easy
to
recognize
news
or
radio
reports
of
these
tests
might
accidentally
give
an
enemy
clues
to
the
type
speed
and
range
of
this
particular
missile
once
he
learned
the
pattern
periodic
censorship
or
even
a
complete
blackout
of
sighting
reports
may
be
enforced
during
the
next
year
or
so
for
the
purposes
mentioned
such
action
would
be
justified
but
whenever
such
censorship
is
lifted
the
complete
truth
about
space
visitors
should
be
told
at
the
same
time
the
full
details
of
all
the
major
cases
the
size
of
the
godman
field
space
ship
any
attempted
landings
or
other
efforts
at
contact
by
interplanetary
visitors
and
all
other
details
that
now
are
official
secrets
i
also
believe
that
a
certain
group
of
disk
sightings
in
this
country
is
linked
with
our
guided
missiles
official
announcements
of
course
may
be
delayed
a
long
time
with
this
exception
i
believe
that
americans
should
be
told
the
truth
now
when
the
announcement
of
our
guided
missiles
is
made
some
americans
not
familiar
with
the
facts
may
accept
it
as
a
full
answer
if
officials
are
not
yet
ready
to
reveal
the
facts
the
mantell
evidence
and
other
key
cases
may
be
deliberately
glossed
over
but
even
if
all
the
evidence
the
sightings
the
old
records
the
and
other
cases
should
be
completely
ignored
americans
can
not
escape
eventual
contact
with
dwellers
on
other
planets
even
though
space
visitors
never
attempt
contact
with
us
sooner
or
later
earthlings
will
be
traveling
to
distant
planets
planets
that
scientists
have
said
are
almost
surely
inhabited
the
american
people
have
proved
their
ability
to
take
incredible
things
we
have
survived
the
stunning
impact
of
the
atomic
age
we
should
be
able
to
take
the
interplanetary
age
when
it
comes
without
hysteria
